Horace Guilder.

00:05.631 --> 00:07.297
<i>Department of Defense.</i>

00:07.383 --> 00:10.009
- You're a bad guy.
- Did you just read my mind?

00:10.094 --> 00:12.678
Now it's time
to induce telepathic connection.

00:13.597 --> 00:15.597
Stand up, Winston.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.577
- I'm a freaking genius.
- I was exposed

00:17.601 --> 00:18.641
<i>to Carter's blood.</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:22.771
<i>I can't believe you let</i>

00:22.898 --> 00:24.606
Elizabeth get that bad.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.192
- You could bring her back.
- By giving her

00:27.319 --> 00:28.402
<i>the virus?</i>

00:28.529 --> 00:29.548
How do you feel about

00:29.572 --> 00:30.863
<i>getting out of this place?</i>

00:30.948 --> 00:32.031
You got a plan?

00:34.160 --> 00:35.993
I suggest you run.

00:38.289 --> 00:39.496
Run!

00:42.960 --> 00:45.000
- You just did that.
- I just did that.

Damn it.

01:11.864 --> 01:12.864
- Hey.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.990
...Hey, hey, take it easy.

01:15.076 --> 01:15.991
It's okay.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.951
- I'm here.
- Mm-hmm.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.412
That scream.

01:20.498 --> 01:22.331
How did you do that?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.958
I don't know.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.835
- I just did it.
- Okay.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.253
Wolgast, you in there?

01:28.339 --> 01:29.922
Yeah! Yeah, we're in here.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.257
The elevator's stuck,
and I can't get it moving.

01:33.302 --> 01:34.302
Give me a minute.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.889
Hey. Take it easy.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.036
All right, listen to me. I have
to explain something to you.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.102
- My book.
- I know. Sweetheart...

01:43.145 --> 01:44.456
No, no, no, my book.
I shouldn't have left it.

01:44.480 --> 01:45.646
I don't want to lose it.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.272
Okay, this is more important.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.476
What you did back there...
That was awesome.

01:49.527 --> 01:51.360
You saved my life.

01:51.403 --> 01:54.279
But you cannot tell anybody
what you can do.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.698
The mind reading
or the crazy scream,

01:56.826 --> 01:59.284
none of it.
I don't trust these people.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.452
Promise me?

02:00.538 --> 02:02.204
- I just want my book.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.167
Get back, back.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.006
- She all right?
- She's fine.

02:13.134 --> 02:14.383
Is that thing still out there?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.508
Not for long.
We're tracking him now.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.512
Let's get them to the safe room.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.898
Jonas.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.153
What happened to me?

02:34.238 --> 02:36.238
You were sick.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.730
I don't think I'm sick anymore.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.160
No.

02:41.245 --> 02:44.163
No, I don't think
you are, either.

02:44.206 --> 02:47.166
I missed you.

02:47.293 --> 02:48.750
I missed you, too.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.594
Dr. Pet.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.140
I'm so sorry.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.475
What a mess.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.228
Is that all you can say?
This is all your fault.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.939
Really? I just authorized
the funding for this project.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.357
You made these monsters.

03:12.443 --> 03:14.296
I warned you
that the virals were dangerous.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.528
I told you
that we don't understand them.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.675
Now can we agree
that we should shut down?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.532
No. We can't.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.579
Major Sykes,
you sat in my office

03:22.661 --> 03:25.120
and practically wept
when we offered you the job.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.017
Now, for the first time in
three years, I'm finally seeing

03:27.041 --> 03:29.269
something of value come off
this island of Dr. Moreau,

03:29.293 --> 03:30.937
so we're gonna see
where this goes.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.480
The body count
doesn't bother you?

03:32.504 --> 03:34.941
This hypocritical line in
the sand you've suddenly drawn?

03:34.965 --> 03:36.965
Please.
You've been experimenting

03:37.092 --> 03:39.760
on human beings for three years.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.763
And if Winston eats
half of Colorado,

03:42.890 --> 03:45.891
the tab for that meal will be
picked up by you and Dr. Lear.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.118
Ah.
Everything looks great, Shauna.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.204
I'm happy with all your stats.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.331
Do you have any questions
for me?

04:09.416 --> 04:11.750
Not a question
so much as an observation.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.377
This place is boring.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.128
Death row was more exciting.

04:15.214 --> 04:19.341
Well, we have a sudoku book
and jigsaw puzzle.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.426
That sounds great.

04:20.511 --> 04:21.738
If you could also bring me a gun

04:21.762 --> 04:23.762
so I could shoot myself
in the head.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.098
What can we do for you, Shauna?

04:26.183 --> 04:28.016
How about a horror movie?

04:28.102 --> 04:30.269
Please?

04:30.396 --> 04:33.605
Literally,
this is my best friend.

04:34.984 --> 04:36.858
Which horror movie?

04:36.986 --> 04:38.860
Surprise me.

04:38.904 --> 04:42.531
Well, the only horror movie
I've ever seen is

04:42.658 --> 04:44.738
<i>I Still Know
What You Did Last Summer.</i>

04:45.786 --> 04:48.036
Okay, I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.664
I don't understand this weird,
sheltered life you've led

04:50.749 --> 04:52.769
where you've literally
never seen or heard of anything.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.271
- You don't know me.
- And why is that,

04:54.295 --> 04:57.421
Dr. Everything in My Life
Is a Secret?

04:59.216 --> 05:01.758
- You want a horror movie?
- Mm-hmm.

05:01.844 --> 05:05.137
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

05:05.264 --> 05:08.098
- Pizza would be nice, too.
- Don't push it.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.183
<i>Ma'am?</i>

05:10.269 --> 05:12.227
Ma'am?

05:12.354 --> 05:14.104
They need you upstairs.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.162
That's affirmative, sir,
that's correct...

05:31.498 --> 05:33.218
- I want my book.
- I...

05:33.292 --> 05:34.644
I know, sweetie,
but we don't have time

05:34.668 --> 05:37.252
to look for it right now.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.255
Winston's off the perimeter.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.484
Tore the locator chip
from his neck.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.050
They found it near the fence.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.301
Could be anywhere.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.156
Richards,
we need to contain this.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.929
If Winston gets

05:48.015 --> 05:50.160
to a densely populated area,
that's the end.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.851
I'm aware. The drones
can't penetrate the canopies...

05:55.564 --> 05:58.231
See if you can pick him up
on satellite.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.068
I think I'm seeing
what Winston's seeing.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.528
Amy, no. Quiet.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.698
Amy, do you know
Winston's location?

06:06.742 --> 06:09.576
She's not getting involved
in this.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.740
Amy, are you saying
you can read his mind?

06:13.791 --> 06:15.207
Unbelievable.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.125
What exactly can you see?

06:17.169 --> 06:19.461
Lights. Headlights going by.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.588
I knew it! She can do it!

06:21.632 --> 06:22.923
Maybe Winston's near a highway.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.175
- Could be the 145.
- All right.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.405
Well, then, we should go there,
and we should bring Amy with us.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.222
No, you're not taking a little
girl to chase after a nightmare

06:30.307 --> 06:32.265
- that you created.
- I can help.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.976
- You saw what I did before.
- No.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.814
I can find him.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.691
Think about all the people
he might hurt.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.114
If she goes, I go.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.658
What do you think, Amy?
Is it all right if he comes?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.827
- Yeah.
- All right, then.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.848
He can come,
but you're riding with me.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.164
Let's go.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.291
Let's go!

07:00.003 --> 07:02.462
Clark?

07:04.091 --> 07:06.049
Take care of Amy.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.467
And be careful.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.594
I will.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.889
I mean it.

07:12.975 --> 07:16.309
Don't die while
we're in the middle of a fight.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.272
I always finish my fights.

07:47.426 --> 07:48.800
What's going on?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.720
Stay here.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.726
Set a perimeter. We'll
get a roadblock down there.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.144
These are the rules.

08:41.230 --> 08:44.231
You stay glued to my side
at all times, all right?

08:44.316 --> 08:46.756
If you have any more of those
flashes, you tell me first,

08:46.818 --> 08:47.818
not Guilder.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.736
That guy is bad news.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.571
And this is important.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.574
Even when things get scary,
we stay calm, got it?

08:54.660 --> 08:56.535
That's a lot of rules.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.328
Sir,

08:58.372 --> 08:59.913
there's another body over here.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.601
- Stay back. Stay back.
- Well, you just said,

09:01.625 --> 09:03.208
"Stay glued to my side."

09:03.252 --> 09:05.438
Yeah, and now I'm telling you
to stay back! Just listen to me.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.379
I am listening.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.635
He's an efficient killer,
I'll give him that.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.240
Can we just go ahead
and say "vampire"?

09:15.264 --> 09:17.681
All right, secure the area.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.975
Was someone else in the car?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.352
Son of a bitch.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.157
What the hell is this?

09:36.285 --> 09:39.160
You were bringing Lila here?

09:39.204 --> 09:40.328
She was a liability.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.622
You never should have
gotten her involved.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.958
Son of a bitch.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.460
How much damage are you
gonna be responsible for?

09:49.965 --> 09:51.165
It's all right. Let him go.

09:54.011 --> 09:57.345
I swear to God,
if anything happens to Lila...

09:57.431 --> 09:58.763
You're gonna murder me?

09:58.890 --> 10:00.432
Shoot me in the face? I got it.

10:00.559 --> 10:01.703
I made the choice
to get involved with this,

10:01.727 --> 10:02.892
and she's innocent.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.185
No, she's not.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.729
We're looking
for Winston, Agent,

10:05.856 --> 10:06.896
not your wife.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.106
I just saw something.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.317
Didn't I say
to talk to me first?

10:10.402 --> 10:12.027
What'd you see, Amy?

10:12.070 --> 10:15.030
Trees. A cabin. A lady.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.448
Tree, cabin and a lady.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.575
Can you dial that in
any further?

10:19.828 --> 10:21.745
It's this way.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.080
- Come on.
- No, Amy, stop! Stop!

10:25.459 --> 10:26.833
Oh, she's fast.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.960
I wonder why.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.085
What was it like
when you were sick?

10:51.109 --> 10:54.027
You mean when I lost my mind?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.905
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

10:56.948 --> 11:01.326
Well, it's like you...
you lost everything.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.786
You know, first your keys,

11:02.871 --> 11:05.455
then your... wallet,
your phone,

11:05.499 --> 11:07.352
and then everyone
you care about.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.709
You.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.420
It was like there was this big
hole where my life used to be.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.255
It was just...

11:14.341 --> 11:17.217
filled with fear and... panic.

11:19.930 --> 11:22.764
Oh, and then Tim came to me.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.683
What did he say?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.186
You're not surprised.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.731
No.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.817
Um, he said...

11:33.860 --> 11:36.695
he said he was gonna save me.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.659
Hey. Jonas?

11:46.540 --> 11:49.833
I've done a lot of research
into this hideous disease.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.796
No one has ever come back
from Alzheimer's.

12:01.596 --> 12:04.264
What is it that you want
to tell me?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.060
Do you remember...

12:09.146 --> 12:11.521
the Bolivia expedition?

12:17.362 --> 12:18.570
Hold it. Wait.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.658
- What did I tell you?!
- Why are you yelling at me?

12:23.702 --> 12:25.763
I'm yelling because
you're not listening to me!

12:25.787 --> 12:27.245
I told you to stay close.

12:27.289 --> 12:28.641
Did you see
what Winston did to that guy?

12:28.665 --> 12:30.601
No, because you
didn't let me see.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.644
Well, it was terrible.
Amy, please,

12:31.668 --> 12:32.959
you have to do what I say.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.003
Why? You're not my dad.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.630
You're just some guy
that tried to kidnap me.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.466
I hate to interrupt

12:39.509 --> 12:42.761
this daddy-daughter-agent-
foster kid teaching moment,

12:42.846 --> 12:44.824
but we got to keep moving.
Amy, are you all right?

12:44.848 --> 12:46.389
Yeah, I'm good.

12:46.475 --> 12:48.308
It's this way.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.332
Those alarms you heard
were set off

12:53.356 --> 12:55.732
because one
of the virals escaped.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.030
Are you gonna say anything?

13:04.409 --> 13:06.529
I'm trying to imagine
writing a character

13:06.578 --> 13:08.912
who finds out she's...

13:08.997 --> 13:12.373
been rescued from Alzheimer's

13:12.417 --> 13:15.460
by a serum that will turn her
into an immortal

13:15.545 --> 13:18.630
blood-drinking thing
in 48 hours.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.512
And what she would say
to her husband.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.722
'Cause what
you're s-saying is...

13:27.808 --> 13:29.390
is insane.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.435
Jonas, please.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.313
Tell me you're...
you're messing with me.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.983
I couldn't let you go.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.948
Well, apparently, you're gonna
have to pretty soon.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.326
I went to Tim Fanning's funeral.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.037
I watched you eulogize him.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.705
What was in that casket?

13:52.791 --> 13:53.893
- How could you even...
- Elizabeth...

13:53.917 --> 13:55.792
No. No, no, no, don't.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.378
And after...

13:58.463 --> 14:01.631
after Tim, you gave the virus
to 12 death row inmates,

14:01.716 --> 14:03.258
one of whom is...

14:03.343 --> 14:05.426
running loose...

14:05.554 --> 14:07.887
and a child.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.515
A little girl.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.227
Look, every step
of this felt like...

14:14.354 --> 14:17.105
like we were so close, like...

14:17.232 --> 14:19.732
like it could be the last.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.861
Well, it certainly feels
like the end now.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.494
<i>Grey infected Elizabeth
with the virus.</i>

14:31.580 --> 14:33.808
-What?
-It was Fanning.
He has control over him.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.748
The guards have the footage.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.500
They put Grey in holding.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.586
I got to start her
on the antivirals,

14:39.629 --> 14:43.214
- get ahead of the-the decline.
- I have another idea.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.632
It's a reach.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.176
- Okay. Tell me.
- I looked at surveillance

14:47.262 --> 14:48.428
of Winston's escape.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.263
When he attacked Agent Wolgast,

14:50.307 --> 14:52.307
Amy screamed,
and when she screamed,

14:52.392 --> 14:55.435
Fanning's power flatlined
in our E.M. data.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.229
Are you saying Amy's
more powerful than Fanning?

14:58.315 --> 15:00.273
Well, it's possible.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.859
We've made all the viruses
from Fanning thus far.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.862
Let's make one from Amy's blood
and use that against Fanning's.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.489
- Crowd out Fanning's virus?
- Precisely.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.909
Amy's altered virus
could overwhelm Fanning's,

15:10.952 --> 15:13.494
and maybe we can prevent
Elizabeth's turn

15:13.580 --> 15:15.622
and keep the Alzheimer's at bay.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.290
That's a good idea.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.658
Thank you, Nichole.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.627
Okay.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.096
<i>Winston!</i>

15:35.769 --> 15:37.936
We had a plan, Winston.

15:38.063 --> 15:41.105
Yeah, your plan?

15:41.232 --> 15:44.943
Well, I saw a way out,
and I took it.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.070
What? Anyone would have.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.656
We were this close,

15:49.741 --> 15:52.325
you dumb, sadistic hillbilly!

15:52.452 --> 15:55.662
Carter was 12.

15:55.747 --> 15:58.665
I was hungry.

15:58.750 --> 16:03.086
Did you even think about
how this is gonna end for you?

16:03.171 --> 16:05.797
Nobody can stop me out here.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.548
Now, come on, you were right.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.592
I'm at the top
of the food chain.

16:12.847 --> 16:15.348
It's good to be the king.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.578
Well, you've had
a few too many drinks, Winston.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.060
It's gone to your head.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.020
'Cause that little girl...

16:21.106 --> 16:23.022
is tracking you,

16:23.108 --> 16:25.483
and she's leading them
right to you.

16:25.527 --> 16:28.444
And I'm trying to find a way
to get you back in the fold

16:28.530 --> 16:29.988
and put us back on track,

16:30.073 --> 16:32.031
but you need to find a way

16:32.117 --> 16:35.243
to kill the girl
before she finds you.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.328
Kill her?

16:36.454 --> 16:37.515
Oh, really?
I mean, come on,

16:37.539 --> 16:38.830
I-I... I thought she was family.

16:38.873 --> 16:39.913
Ain't she one of us?

16:39.958 --> 16:41.918
I don't know
what the hell she is,

16:41.960 --> 16:44.961
but she's not playing
for our team, so figure it out.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.564
No.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.066
Yes.<i> The Fly...</i>

17:07.193 --> 17:09.109
and pizza.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.903
The original or Cronenberg?

17:11.031 --> 17:13.196
Cronenberg. I did my homework.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.615
Oh, my God.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.659
Thank you.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.973
Yeah, well, I don't know
how you got me to do that.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.204
Well, enjoy.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.622
You're not staying?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.685
I told you, I don't like
horror movies. And besides,

17:23.710 --> 17:24.666
- I have work to do.
- Come on.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.960
I am your work.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.378
You got to be bored
out of your mind here, too.

17:28.423 --> 17:31.132
There's what, like,
five other women who work here?

17:31.259 --> 17:32.778
Come on, stay
for the first ten minutes.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.427
Have a piece of pizza.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.056
You have had
pizza before, right?

17:40.268 --> 17:41.934
Ten minutes.

17:54.783 --> 17:57.450
So, what'd you think?

17:57.494 --> 17:59.577
Well, I am filled
with dread and nausea,

17:59.662 --> 18:01.412
and I wish I could unsee that,

18:01.456 --> 18:02.747
- so thanks, Shauna.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.457
Hey, what's this?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.084
You've got a semicolon tattoo.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.754
It's nothing.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.805
Mine was kind of half-assed.

18:18.932 --> 18:22.391
I chased a handful of Tylenol
down with some vodka,

18:22.477 --> 18:24.894
but I knew my mom
was coming home soon.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.063
I was 14.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.898
Mine wasn't half-assed.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.525
It was serious.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.568
I was 18.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.614
Well, I'm glad you made it.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.909
You, too.

18:44.749 --> 18:48.126
An overdose of Tylenol
can be fatal.

18:48.211 --> 18:51.129
Nothing half-assed about that.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.799
Hey, you want to do me
another favor?

18:54.843 --> 18:57.635
Now that we're
botched suicide sisters.

18:57.762 --> 18:59.428
What now?

19:07.438 --> 19:09.313
Hello?

19:09.399 --> 19:11.524
Hello?

19:19.951 --> 19:21.576
Okay.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.703
Okay, hang on, hang on.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.833
All right. I'm coming.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.418
Just stay with me.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.794
Ow.

19:39.762 --> 19:42.722
Okay, you're okay.
Just stay with me.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.769
Hey. How's it going?

19:48.897 --> 19:51.063
I've introduced Amy's virus
to Fanning's.

19:51.149 --> 19:54.150
I'm hoping hers will kick
the crap out of his shortly.

19:56.446 --> 19:57.945
Any word on Winston?

19:58.031 --> 19:59.447
They're tracking him.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.866
And two dead so far.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.079
How's Elizabeth?

20:08.666 --> 20:10.374
She's bewildered,

20:10.460 --> 20:12.376
angry...

20:12.462 --> 20:13.462
terrified.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.504
Jonas, we'll find a way.

20:15.632 --> 20:16.923
We'll help her.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.633
Her mind was...

20:18.760 --> 20:21.260
dismantled by a disease,
and now that she's come back

20:21.387 --> 20:24.096
only to discover that...

20:24.182 --> 20:26.098
her reprieve...

20:26.184 --> 20:28.809
was just a preamble
to something so much worse.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.691
I did this.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.401
We did this.

20:37.528 --> 20:41.572
I've been here
from the beginning.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.802
I mean, what are we expecting
from these creatures?

20:43.826 --> 20:46.327
We know what they're capable of.
Winston's already out there.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.955
The risks are unacceptable.
How can Guilder not see this?

20:48.998 --> 20:51.332
How can the Department
of Defense not see this?

20:51.459 --> 20:52.959
Jonas, stop.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.379
Let's help Elizabeth.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.383
Let me finish
what I'm doing, okay?

21:00.468 --> 21:02.385
Go back to your wife.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.520
Hey.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.541
I need a field clearance
for tonight

21:14.565 --> 21:16.357
for about three hours.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.775
Purpose?

21:17.860 --> 21:19.902
Going to a movie.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.780
Really?

21:22.865 --> 21:25.616
What's "really" about it?

21:26.869 --> 21:28.160
Nothing.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.057
Uh, and you're
the head of medical.

21:30.081 --> 21:33.040
You actually don't need
my clearance, Major Sykes.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.918
We've been here over two years.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.504
You can call me Nichole.

21:39.549 --> 21:40.631
Okay.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.925
Only if you call me Clark.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.305
Uh, what movie
are you going to see?

21:47.432 --> 21:49.432
Um,<i> A Quiet Place.</i> Yeah.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.268
Shauna Babcock wants me to go
see it and tell her about it.

21:52.395 --> 21:55.104
You guys have been
getting close.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.106
Are you sure that's a good idea?

21:57.233 --> 21:59.775
No, no, it's a terrible idea,

21:59.861 --> 22:03.029
but... it's what's happening.

22:03.156 --> 22:06.324
Um, it's a scary movie.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.079
Would you like some company,
Nichole?

22:19.589 --> 22:22.256
Oh. Oh.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.091
- Oh.
- Hey.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.738
- Hey, hey, easy, easy.
- Oh. Oh.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.281
- Oh.
- You need to be still,

22:27.305 --> 22:29.545
or else the wound's
gonna start bleeding again.

22:30.099 --> 22:33.100
I feel amazing.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.480
I do.

22:37.565 --> 22:40.057
- I really do.
- You lost so much blood.

22:40.151 --> 22:41.859
Two and a half cups flour.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.362
- Your wound has healed.
- One and a half cups butter.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.572
That's one and a half sticks
of butter

22:46.699 --> 22:49.139
cut into little pieces. Put it
in the food processor bowl.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.369
One teaspoon of salt.

22:51.496 --> 22:52.661
One teaspoon of sugar.

22:52.747 --> 22:54.955
Pulse. Pulse.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.047
No!

23:04.384 --> 23:06.550
- Hey!

23:10.181 --> 23:11.806
Lila!

23:11.933 --> 23:13.724
Give me the light.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.302
Just so we're clear,
it's worse than we thought

23:30.326 --> 23:32.179
because they can make more
of themselves?

23:32.203 --> 23:34.453
Same thing happened with Fanning
in Bolivia.

23:34.539 --> 23:35.830
This is a disaster.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.081
Yeah.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.208
That you created.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.419
What happened to you, Clark?

23:41.504 --> 23:42.920
I mean, what the hell

23:43.005 --> 23:44.338
are you people doing?

23:44.382 --> 23:46.465
You shouldn't even be here.

23:46.551 --> 23:47.551
This is a crime...

23:51.389 --> 23:52.491
It's about to get
a whole lot worse

23:52.515 --> 23:53.431
if we don't get back on track.

23:53.516 --> 23:54.640
We got to find Winston.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.183
Any ideas, kid?

23:58.479 --> 23:59.937
Clocks.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.981
Pipes.

24:02.066 --> 24:02.982
Water.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.526
This is so damn wonderful.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.445
You are a marvel.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.363
Clocks.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.490
Do you mean, um, water gauges?

24:11.576 --> 24:13.325
Uh, flow meters?

24:13.411 --> 24:15.161
I don't know what those are.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.204
There's a...

24:17.290 --> 24:19.450
there's a pumping station
a few klicks west.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.333
That might be what she means.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.378
Well, all right. Let's go.

24:31.888 --> 24:33.762
Hello, kiddo.

24:36.225 --> 24:37.892
Hi.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.435
Are you here,

24:39.562 --> 24:41.937
or am I somewhere else?

24:42.064 --> 24:44.190
That's a good question.

24:44.275 --> 24:46.984
Doesn't matter, really.

24:47.069 --> 24:50.404
I just wanted to check in on you
and see how you're feeling.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.073
How do you think I'm feeling?

24:53.159 --> 24:55.159
Better, I hope.

24:55.286 --> 24:57.264
I mean, the whole point
of this endeavor,

24:57.288 --> 24:59.330
of the Bolivia expedition

24:59.415 --> 25:01.415
and Project Noah,
the tests on 4B...

25:01.501 --> 25:03.417
That was always to save you.

25:03.503 --> 25:06.045
To free you from the-the prison
of your own mind.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.296
And we did it.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.298
I did it.

25:09.425 --> 25:13.219
But it, it's temporary, Tim.

25:13.304 --> 25:16.055
No, I assure you, it is not.

25:16.140 --> 25:19.558
Lizzy, my mind is sharp.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.144
My mind is...

25:22.188 --> 25:24.188
it's powerful,
and it's pretty great.

25:24.232 --> 25:26.106
- You're not in pain?
- No.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.526
I feel incredible.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.945
And I'm very optimistic
about the future.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.841
'Cause you think
that Jonas will find a cure?

25:32.865 --> 25:35.449
Oh, hell no.

25:35.535 --> 25:38.452
No, Lizzy,
the virus was the cure.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.872
It's the cure
for humanity and...

25:44.126 --> 25:46.835
...all of its imperfections.
What?

25:46.879 --> 25:49.338
- It's just me.
- No.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.590
No, it's not.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.384
Okay.

25:53.469 --> 25:56.929
What did Jonas tell you
about all of us down on 4B?

25:57.014 --> 25:58.222
He called you monsters.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.285
No, the monsters are the doctors
that imprison us.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.560
The monsters are the Mengeles.

26:02.687 --> 26:04.414
The monsters are the doctors
in Tuskegee.

26:04.438 --> 26:07.314
The monsters are Jonas
and Sykes.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.109
We are not the monsters.

26:11.195 --> 26:12.945
We started off as victims.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.991
But now...

26:17.076 --> 26:19.076
now we're the lucky ones.

26:19.161 --> 26:21.287
How am I lucky?

26:21.372 --> 26:22.496
Sweetheart,

26:22.623 --> 26:24.498
you have a passport

26:24.625 --> 26:26.500
that is stamped

26:26.627 --> 26:29.211
for a spectacular future.

26:30.631 --> 26:33.591
And not everyone's invited
to the party.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.686
You know what that bite was?

26:45.771 --> 26:48.063
That was first transmission.

26:48.107 --> 26:52.026
One viral that can infect
an infinite number of people.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.320
That's
a highly contagious virus.

26:54.405 --> 26:56.447
I know, it's bad.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.408
Brad, it's catastrophic.

26:59.493 --> 27:01.327
What's going on with Amy?

27:01.412 --> 27:03.140
- Is she symptom-free?
- No.

27:03.164 --> 27:06.874
Hell no. She's connected
to the rest of them somehow.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.877
She's stronger, faster. Psychic.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.337
She's not listening to me.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.631
Well, that's not the virus.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.633
- That's puberty.
- I know.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.635
Which is also catastrophic.

27:17.678 --> 27:20.596
I'm trying to protect her,
and suddenly I'm the enemy.

27:20.681 --> 27:23.974
She's had a lot
of decisions made for her.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.787
She just wants control
over her life.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.269
We never got this far with Eva.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.147
Hey.

27:30.232 --> 27:32.419
Pumping station's
about a hundred yards ahead.

27:32.443 --> 27:34.443
Keep your eyes open.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.488
I'm sorry I got you into this.

27:41.952 --> 27:43.661
They have the coordinates.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.829
Soon as you can.

27:45.915 --> 27:47.706
My team's almost here.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.416
We can't wait on them.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.918
If he's in there,

27:51.003 --> 27:52.961
we got to move now.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.507
All right, wonder kid.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.258
Is he in there?

27:59.637 --> 28:01.679
He's in there.

28:01.764 --> 28:03.097
Come on.

28:03.224 --> 28:04.264
Get a shot, right here.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.933
Amy, you're staying here.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.685
No. Why?

28:07.770 --> 28:10.165
Because I don't want anything
terrible to happen to you.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.042
Something terrible's
already happened to me.

28:12.066 --> 28:13.774
You kidnapped me.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.193
They put the virus in me.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.820
And I want my book back!

28:17.905 --> 28:20.114
That's the only thing
I had left!

28:20.199 --> 28:21.824
My mom gave it to me.

28:21.951 --> 28:23.534
Wolgast.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.411
Plan's changed. You're in.

28:25.496 --> 28:26.954
All right.

28:26.997 --> 28:29.456
Okay, this is the plan.
Okay, just give me the walkie,

28:29.542 --> 28:31.353
and we're gonna stay out here
and be on lookout.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.502
Cool?

28:55.109 --> 28:57.109
All right.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.694
Let's move out.

28:59.697 --> 29:01.363
Hey.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.073
She's too smart

29:03.159 --> 29:04.239
to fall for your act.

29:04.326 --> 29:05.617
I don't know.

29:05.703 --> 29:07.745
Think we're getting along
pretty good.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.971
Were the monsters CGI,
or were they practical?

29:26.015 --> 29:28.182
I have no idea what that means.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.100
Did they seem computer-made

29:30.144 --> 29:31.705
or like somebody made them
by hand?

29:31.729 --> 29:33.520
Oh, definitely computer-made.

29:33.564 --> 29:35.814
But they didn't have any eyes.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.357
They had all these limbs

29:37.485 --> 29:40.736
and ears in the worst way.

29:41.781 --> 29:42.821
I have a question

29:42.907 --> 29:44.259
about what we talked about
last time.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.699
Well, that's too bad,

29:45.826 --> 29:47.220
'cause I'm not gonna discuss it
with you.

29:47.244 --> 29:48.577
I'm not gonna ask you

29:48.662 --> 29:50.307
about your serious
suicide attempt.

29:50.331 --> 29:52.664
- Good.
- I want to know why you chose

29:52.750 --> 29:56.293
to join the military and work
on an isolated mountaintop

29:56.420 --> 29:59.004
in the loneliest place on Earth.

30:03.427 --> 30:06.303
For me,
surviving was a second chance.

30:06.430 --> 30:07.930
You know, I...

30:08.015 --> 30:09.743
I wanted to do
something important.

30:09.767 --> 30:12.267
Something good.

30:12.394 --> 30:13.727
So here we are.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.564
There was a time
I wanted to die.

30:17.691 --> 30:20.067
But now all I want to do
is live.

30:20.194 --> 30:22.903
Which is why I took
this sketchy deal.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.991
Look, I know

30:28.118 --> 30:29.888
there were people here
before me.

30:29.912 --> 30:32.037
Someone named Winston
scratched his name

30:32.164 --> 30:33.404
into the wall behind the bed.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.499
So I've just been wondering...

30:35.543 --> 30:37.626
what happened to those guys?

30:37.753 --> 30:40.128
What happened to Winston?

30:44.927 --> 30:48.178
Shauna, you're doing great.

30:48.264 --> 30:50.722
You're young. You're strong.

30:50.808 --> 30:53.141
Your body is responding
really well to the medicine.

30:53.227 --> 30:54.935
I am so hopeful.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.939
You didn't answer the question.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.983
I'm your doctor.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.611
Whatever happens, I'm gonna be
with you every step of the way.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.405
Okay?

31:07.491 --> 31:09.491
Okay.

31:25.593 --> 31:27.509
Hands up. Turn around.

31:27.595 --> 31:28.595
Viral!

31:34.810 --> 31:35.976
It's not Winston.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.352
There could be more.

31:40.566 --> 31:41.732
Damn it.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.567
It's not working, is it?

31:43.694 --> 31:45.360
That's a shame.

31:45.487 --> 31:48.280
You worked real hard.

31:48.365 --> 31:52.784
Hi, Shauna. I was wondering
when you'd get here.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.681
I was wondering the same thing
about you.

31:54.705 --> 31:55.954
You were my doctor,

31:56.040 --> 31:57.414
you were my friend.

31:57.499 --> 31:58.624
But as soon as I turned,

31:58.709 --> 32:00.520
it was like none
of that happened.

32:00.544 --> 32:01.919
Like none of that mattered.

32:02.004 --> 32:03.587
Of course it mattered.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.340
You talked a big game
about being there for me

32:06.467 --> 32:07.758
no matter what.

32:07.885 --> 32:09.968
Instead, you abandoned me.

32:10.012 --> 32:11.323
I'm sorry, Shauna,
your brain scans...

32:11.347 --> 32:13.241
I really didn't think
you were there anymore.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.474
I've had a lot of time
to think about you

32:15.559 --> 32:18.185
and our doctor-patient
relationship.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.228
And you know what I think?

32:21.273 --> 32:23.690
You're a bad person.

32:23.817 --> 32:26.068
You're the worst kind
of bad person,

32:26.111 --> 32:27.653
because you think you're good.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.218
You knew what you were
getting into.

32:32.242 --> 32:35.535
Is this doing good
in the world, Nichole?

32:35.663 --> 32:37.162
Is this why you survived?

32:37.289 --> 32:39.449
Is that the story you tell
yourself at night?

32:39.500 --> 32:43.043
Whatever you're doing
to Clark Richards, knock it off.

32:43.087 --> 32:46.505
I'm not doing anything to him
that he doesn't want done.

32:49.093 --> 32:51.468
You're not gonna find a cure,
by the way.

32:51.595 --> 32:54.096
You're not gonna save me,

32:54.223 --> 32:56.890
you're not gonna save Elizabeth,
and you're not gonna save Amy.

32:56.976 --> 32:58.620
- Stay away from her.
- No.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.559
She's ours, Nichole.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.728
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

33:01.814 --> 33:05.816
Stop trying. Stop lying.

33:05.901 --> 33:09.444
Stop pretending like you're
gonna get out of this alive.

33:09.530 --> 33:12.364
None of you
are getting out of this alive.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.690
What do you want from me?

33:13.784 --> 33:15.909
I want everything you have.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.411
I want this lab.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.787
I want Project Noah.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.330
I want your boyfriend.

33:20.416 --> 33:23.709
I want everything
that matters to you to be mine.

33:23.794 --> 33:27.671
And when I have it all in hand,

33:27.715 --> 33:30.298
I want to know
what you taste like.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.520
The, um...

33:43.605 --> 33:46.690
the overwhelm process
didn't work.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.526
Fanning's virus wins every time.

33:49.611 --> 33:52.487
He visited Elizabeth.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.741
He told her
that he sees the virals as...

33:55.826 --> 33:58.618
a cure for humanity.

34:02.166 --> 34:05.083
Who did you see just now?

34:06.128 --> 34:08.545
Babcock.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.547
They're gonna kill us all.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.594
I should have killed him
in Bolivia.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.096
You didn't know
what was gonna happen.

34:18.181 --> 34:21.058
Doesn't matter anymore.

34:21.185 --> 34:24.351
I'm the author of this horror.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.431
Too many innocent people
have died.

34:28.525 --> 34:29.399
Babcock's right.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.234
They are gonna kill us.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.030
So let's beat 'em to it.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.282
- They were people once.
- I know.

34:37.367 --> 34:39.659
Fanning was my best friend.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.120
I'm gonna kill him anyway.

34:42.206 --> 34:44.581
I'm gonna kill them all.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.167
Are you in?

34:47.293 --> 34:49.252
Yeah.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.797
I'm in.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.480
...I got two.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.065
Is one of 'em Winston?

35:13.028 --> 35:14.444
- Get back!

35:15.948 --> 35:17.489
Winston's here!

35:25.666 --> 35:27.165
<i>He's here! Winston's here!</i>

35:35.634 --> 35:37.968
<i>Does anybody copy?
Is anybody there?</i>

35:38.595 --> 35:39.886
Hey!

35:39.972 --> 35:41.096
Go! Get Amy! Go!

35:53.986 --> 35:55.652
He's coming for me.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.654
It's me he wants.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.951
I bet I'm faster.

36:03.036 --> 36:04.870
Amy, no!

37:45.222 --> 37:47.422
- Perimeter is clear.
- Support team is five klicks out.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.858
I'm gonna find your book.

38:04.449 --> 38:07.450
You must really miss your mama.

38:11.456 --> 38:12.914
I wish I could've met her.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.792
Sh-She raised an amazing kid.

38:19.506 --> 38:22.424
I lost a daughter.

38:22.509 --> 38:25.510
She was about your age
when she passed.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.304
So I know.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.641
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

38:31.727 --> 38:35.186
And I must think about her,
like, a hundred times a day.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.646
What about you?

38:36.690 --> 38:39.441
Like, 200 times a day.

38:41.445 --> 38:44.029
It's grief, sweetheart.

38:44.114 --> 38:46.197
And it's awful, it's sad,

38:46.283 --> 38:48.992
and it's heavy.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.308
But I want you to know
we can talk about your mama

38:53.332 --> 38:55.165
any time you want.

38:57.169 --> 39:00.628
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

39:00.756 --> 39:04.007
I'm sorry
I wasn't listening to you.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.846
I don't want to lose you.

39:11.808 --> 39:12.932
And I know I'm not your dad.

39:13.060 --> 39:15.477
I d... I don't think that.

39:15.562 --> 39:17.729
But everyone needs someone
in their corner,

39:17.773 --> 39:18.646
and that's what I am.

39:18.732 --> 39:21.900
Okay? I'm-I'm on your side.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.735
No matter what.

39:34.164 --> 39:36.498
Is everything all right?

39:38.919 --> 39:41.828
More or less.

39:43.924 --> 39:46.007
Come on.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.771
Don't make us go back.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.315
Just come back to Noah.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.818
Come up with a plan to get
the three of you out.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.987
This whole thing's gone to hell.
I see that now.

40:13.036 --> 40:16.329
Amy, you're riding with me.
Hop in.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.957
Wolgast.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.501
You're in the next one
with your wife.

40:25.006 --> 40:27.006
It's okay.

40:39.563 --> 40:42.564
You do realize
there's got to be consequences.

40:42.691 --> 40:45.692
There's already consequences.

40:50.907 --> 40:51.907
Ready?

40:55.412 --> 40:56.828
Damn it. They're back.

40:59.499 --> 41:01.619
I'm gonna buy us some more time.
Finish it.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.322
Where's the other car?

41:32.407 --> 41:33.698
And where's the agent?

41:33.783 --> 41:35.074
Oh, he'll be along.

41:39.539 --> 41:41.498
What's wrong?

41:41.625 --> 41:42.625
It hurts.

41:42.667 --> 41:43.958
What hurts?

42:06.566 --> 42:09.275
What's going on?
Is she injured?

42:09.361 --> 42:10.860
No. This just happened.

42:10.946 --> 42:12.028
Could she be turning?

42:12.155 --> 42:13.905
I don't know.

42:13.949 --> 42:16.324
Amy. Amy, what's wrong?

42:16.409 --> 42:18.387
I don't feel good.
It's burning, it's burning.

42:18.411 --> 42:20.473
May have something to do with
what happened at the station.

42:20.497 --> 42:21.746
What happened at the station?

42:21.831 --> 42:24.112
When Winston died,
the virals he created died, too.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.251
...Oh, no, Amy.

42:30.340 --> 42:32.465
Shut it down!
Stop the lights!

42:32.509 --> 42:33.716
Amy's linked to him.

42:33.843 --> 42:36.594
If you kill Fanning, Amy dies.
Elizabeth, too.

43:08.128 --> 43:10.795
It's kinda funny
you don't like horror movies,

43:10.880 --> 43:12.839
since you're living in one.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.759
See you soon.
