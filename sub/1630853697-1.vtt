WEBVTT

00:41.834 --> 00:43.877
Oh, great and mighty Rapu...

00:44.503 --> 00:47.965
we pray to you for water and sustenance.

00:49.508 --> 00:53.512
I pray to you, not for me,
but for my daughter.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.301
I'm tired.

02:12.257 --> 02:15.552
You have suffered.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.222
Come to me.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.391
Come to me.

02:26.772 --> 02:29.149
You have suffered.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.322
Come to me.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.836
You have suffered.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.212
What do we have here?

03:34.756 --> 03:35.757
Look at it.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.676
It's gobbling up all my fruit.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.472
Rapu.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.269
Bringer of Light.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.687
Oh, it's one of mine.

03:50.689 --> 03:53.525
I am Gorr, the last of your disciples.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.612
We have lost everything, my lord.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.405
The land is dry.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.741
All life is lost.

04:00.908 --> 04:05.162
But our faith in you never wavered
and now we await the promise...

04:06.705 --> 04:08.707
of the eternal reward.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.126
Is this why you celebrate?

04:13.462 --> 04:15.506
He thinks there's an eternal reward.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.512
No. No, sorry.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.889
There's no eternal reward for you, dog!

04:25.390 --> 04:28.352
What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.563
We just vanquished
the holder of the Necrosword...

04:31.730 --> 04:33.148
-You have suffered.
-...before he could harm...

04:33.315 --> 04:35.567
-any other gods with that cursed blade.
-If it's revenge you seek.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.111
He threatened to end my entire empire.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.239
But, my lord...

04:40.906 --> 04:43.325
your empire has already ended.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.827
There's no one left to worship you.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.413
There'll be more followers to replace you.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.831
There always are.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.750
We have suffered...

04:53.210 --> 04:55.087
and we have starved.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.883
My daughter died...

05:01.927 --> 05:03.762
-in your name.
-And well you should.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.890
Suffering for your gods is your
only purpose.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.268
There's nothing for you after death.

05:09.768 --> 05:10.811
Except death.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.273
You are no god.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.531
I renounce you.

05:29.705 --> 05:32.749
Now your meaningless life
finally does have a purpose.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.378
To sacrifice yourself to me.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.884
If it's revenge you seek...

05:42.259 --> 05:44.094
...kill all the gods.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.096
Go to Eternity.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.224
If it's revenge you seek...

05:51.018 --> 05:52.394
summon the Bifrost.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.770
Go to Eternity.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.940
-Kill all the gods.
-Summon the Bifrost.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.233
Go to Eternity.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.612
Kill all the gods. Kill all the gods.
Kill all the gods.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.793
The sword chose you.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.588
You are now cursed!

06:19.755 --> 06:20.839
Funny.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.091
It doesn't feel like a curse.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.347
Feels like a promise.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.433
So, this is my vow.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.522
All gods will die.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.319
Come, come, gather round.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.698
And listen to the legend of the
Space Viking.

07:27.865 --> 07:33.495
AKA the God of Thunder.
AKA Thor Odinson.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.212
Raised in the way of the warrior...

07:42.379 --> 07:44.798
Thor was taught to help win battles...

07:44.965 --> 07:48.343
fighting the good fight
for those who can't fight good.

07:50.804 --> 07:54.433
He grew and he grew and he grew.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.352
He was sensitive, like a smile.

07:57.519 --> 08:00.731
And his loving nature did not discriminate.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.901
He once loved a swashbuckling Passionista.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.904
Another time, he loved a Wolf Woman...

08:07.070 --> 08:08.655
on a Woman Wolf.

08:10.616 --> 08:15.287
But Thor's one true love was an
Earth woman named Jane Fonda.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.831
Wait. No. Jane Foster.

08:18.207 --> 08:21.460
But sadly, in the battle for love,
Thor lost.

08:23.462 --> 08:26.423
In fact, he lost a lot of people
in those days.

08:26.590 --> 08:27.716
His mum.

08:27.883 --> 08:29.092
His dad.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.427
And that guy.

08:30.594 --> 08:31.678
And that guy.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.971
And whoever that is.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.264
And Heimdall.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.307
And his brother.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.851
And his brother, again.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.061
And again.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.315
Poor Thor had to watch his planet explode.

08:43.941 --> 08:46.235
And then he said, "What have I done?"

08:46.944 --> 08:50.239
It seemed that everything
and everyone he loved, he lost.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.283
And so he hid his heart
behind a big, fleshy bod...

08:53.450 --> 08:55.911
so it could never be broken again.

08:56.411 --> 08:59.957
But just because he was done loving,
didn't mean he was done fighting.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.710
He teamed up
with the Guardians of the Galaxy...

09:03.877 --> 09:06.296
and set off on some classic
Thor adventures.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.340
He got in shape.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.300
Putting in the hard yards.

09:10.467 --> 09:14.471
Turning pains into gains,
and never skipping leg day.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.934
He went from Dad Bod to God Bod.

09:19.101 --> 09:22.271
But beneath his God Bod,
there was still a Sad Bod...

09:22.437 --> 09:23.564
just trying to get out.

09:26.024 --> 09:29.444
Because all of the bods
that Thor had worn over the years...

09:29.611 --> 09:32.739
couldn't hide the pain
that he was feeling on the inside.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.493
So he gave up his search for love...

09:37.452 --> 09:40.330
accepting that he was only good
for one thing...

09:41.582 --> 09:44.793
Waiting in quiet contemplation
for someone to say...

09:45.252 --> 09:48.505
"Thor, we need your help to win this battle."

09:49.923 --> 09:51.216
Thor.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.385
We need your help to win this battle.

09:53.552 --> 09:54.720
Let's go.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.930
Okay. Come on, Stormbreaker.

09:57.306 --> 09:58.515
Back to work.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.602
We must hurry, okay?

10:02.644 --> 10:04.021
People are dying.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.230
See you down there.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.278
Hurry up!

10:21.705 --> 10:23.999
Give me those.
You're gonna break 'em.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.376
I am Groot!

10:26.543 --> 10:28.170
You got sap all over it.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.634
-Hello, everybody.
-Well, well, look who it is.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.093
How are we doing, guys?

10:35.552 --> 10:36.595
Terrible!

10:37.346 --> 10:38.639
We're all about to die.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.099
You said this planet
would be a relaxing holiday.

10:41.266 --> 10:44.144
I said it was going to be,
"Like a relaxing holiday."

10:44.311 --> 10:47.481
But look at that resplendent skyscape.
Three suns of Saturn.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.191
What could be more relaxing than that?

10:49.650 --> 10:51.235
An actual holiday!

10:51.401 --> 10:53.445
Die Booskan scum!

10:56.365 --> 10:57.699
God of Thunder.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.117
King Yakan.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.787
You have finally joined our fight.

11:01.954 --> 11:04.623
Well, as they say,
"Better late than not at all."

11:04.790 --> 11:06.375
Yes, it's very nice.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.586
As you know,
we used to live in a peaceful oasis.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.631
-But then our gods were murdered.
-Murdered?

11:12.798 --> 11:15.843
And now our sacred temple
has been left unguarded...

11:16.009 --> 11:18.762
and Habooska's hordes
took control of its power.

11:18.929 --> 11:22.307
It is our most sacred shrine
and he desecrates it.

11:22.474 --> 11:23.475
Not for long.

11:25.769 --> 11:29.106
King Yakan, tell them
what happened here today.

11:29.565 --> 11:31.567
Tell of the time that Thor...

11:32.067 --> 11:36.405
and his ragtag, motley crew
of misfit desperados...

11:36.572 --> 11:38.448
turned the tide of the battle...

11:38.615 --> 11:40.701
and etched their names in history.

11:40.868 --> 11:44.079
For the odds may be against us,
but I'll tell you this for free...

11:44.246 --> 11:45.372
Here it comes.

11:45.539 --> 11:49.585
This ends here and now!

13:43.699 --> 13:46.326
He's not going to go into
the temple, is he? No.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.339
Well done, everybody.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.718
We can collectively take credit for that
because we worked as a team.

14:03.552 --> 14:06.346
We used our hearts and our minds
to defeat the enemy...

14:06.513 --> 14:08.140
with minimal loss or damage.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.941
What a classic Thor adventure!

14:18.150 --> 14:19.359
Hurrah!

14:42.966 --> 14:44.384
Good book?

14:44.551 --> 14:45.594
Yeah.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.471
I wrote it.

14:48.472 --> 14:51.058
Wait. You're Dr. Jane Foster?

14:51.225 --> 14:52.392
I am.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.186
-Hi.

14:54.353 --> 14:55.938
How's the Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

14:56.438 --> 14:57.481
It's tough.

14:57.648 --> 14:58.857
-Yeah.
-Really tough.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.776
It's... You need a 3D model.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.402
You ever see Event Horizon?

15:02.569 --> 15:03.612
No.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.240
-Interstellar?
-No.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.200
That movie explains everything
really clearly.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.744
All right. The Einstein-Rosen Bridge...

15:10.911 --> 15:14.498
folds space, so that point A and
point B...

15:15.457 --> 15:17.459
coexist in space and time.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.086
Like that.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.297
You just ruined your own book.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.132
Yeah, but now you understand wormholes.

15:26.885 --> 15:27.886
Watch those movies.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.388
-Okay.

15:29.555 --> 15:31.849
Saw the Hot Cheetos, had to get it.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.066
So, how's it going?

15:41.483 --> 15:44.486
It's going amazing.

15:49.116 --> 15:52.536
Have you told anyone else besides me?

15:53.161 --> 15:57.541
When people find out they start
acting weird. They're just different.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.127
I don't need that in my life right now.

16:00.294 --> 16:01.920
Anyway, it's not that serious.

16:02.296 --> 16:03.589
Jane, it's Stage Four.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.924
Out of, like, how many stages?

16:06.675 --> 16:07.676
Four.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.011
That we know about.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.559
Oh, you have somewhere else
you gotta be right now...

16:15.726 --> 16:17.436
that's more important than chemo?

16:17.853 --> 16:18.854
No.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.988
You're trying to get back to the lab,
aren't you?

16:28.155 --> 16:29.907
I have a few ideas I'm trying.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.867
Okay, no, time out.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.912
I know you think your lab work is
something you have to do...

16:35.078 --> 16:37.623
otherwise you're letting down
all of civilization...

16:38.790 --> 16:41.960
but you're not getting what the universe
is actually trying to tell you...

16:42.127 --> 16:43.504
so let me translate.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.089
Slow down.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.217
You need your energy to fight this thing.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.845
I'll fight it my way, okay?

16:52.054 --> 16:53.347
Well, FYI...

16:53.514 --> 16:57.184
"my way" does not have to equal
alone in a lab.

16:59.603 --> 17:02.189
Maybe it's time to
play the Space Viking card.

17:02.356 --> 17:03.482
It's not a card.

17:03.649 --> 17:04.483
Yes, it is.

17:04.566 --> 17:05.943
-There's no card.
-There's a card.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.487
It's tall, it's blond, and it's gorgeous.

17:08.654 --> 17:10.030
It's a handsome card.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.949
-Jane, are you sure?
-Look, Darcy...

17:12.156 --> 17:15.285
I will figure this out by myself.

17:22.917 --> 17:25.963
Results are still coming back the same.

17:26.505 --> 17:28.464
I'm afraid the chemo has
very little effect.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.219
I'm so sorry, Jane.

17:33.595 --> 17:36.849
If there's anything I can do,
or if you just wanna talk, call me.

18:31.528 --> 18:34.615
Smell like a king, because you're worthy.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.158
Old Spice.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.120
Cut!

19:07.189 --> 19:09.441
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.026
Home.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.361
Yes, home, Father.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.530
We're here to take you home.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.449
Yes. To planet Asgard.

19:17.616 --> 19:19.993
Asgard is not a planet, my sons.

19:20.369 --> 19:22.746
It is people.
It is you!

19:22.913 --> 19:27.584
And now, it is time for me
to pass on to the spirit realm.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.047
I will take my place...

19:32.214 --> 19:35.092
in the great banqueting hall
of Valhalla...

19:35.259 --> 19:37.594
the resting place of the gods.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.721
Oh, one more thing.

19:40.639 --> 19:41.890
You have a sister.

19:43.100 --> 19:46.812
And so now, I turn into godly stardust...

19:47.271 --> 19:49.022
and say farewell.

19:49.690 --> 19:50.691
Oh, look.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.193
Do you see? It's happening.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.612
I'm disappearing.

20:00.117 --> 20:01.618
No!

20:01.785 --> 20:02.828
Father!

20:04.997 --> 20:06.415
But wait! Brother!

20:07.875 --> 20:11.086
An ominous portal hath appeared behind us.

20:11.628 --> 20:12.754
Transform!

20:22.598 --> 20:25.267
I am Hela, Goddess of Death.

20:25.434 --> 20:30.397
Now, I return to Asgard to stake my claim
as the rightful heir to the throne...

20:30.564 --> 20:32.316
and no one will stop me!

20:32.482 --> 20:33.483
Join me or die!

20:33.650 --> 20:35.944
We will never join you, witch!
Mjolnir!

20:40.824 --> 20:42.117
Impossible!

20:43.619 --> 20:45.495
I broke your hammer!

20:45.662 --> 20:47.080
Time to die!

20:47.247 --> 20:48.540
Bifrost!

21:00.385 --> 21:02.846
You can almost feel the power...

21:03.013 --> 21:05.807
of these magnificent and immovable stones.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.685
Okay. Let's head back to the village...

21:08.852 --> 21:11.772
where we can drink
some real Asgardian mead.

21:11.939 --> 21:13.524
Come on.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.060
God of Disaster...

21:51.270 --> 21:52.479
we thank you.

21:52.646 --> 21:56.358
We feared we would be at war forever
without the protection of our gods...

21:56.525 --> 21:59.528
but now, peace shall reign.

22:00.028 --> 22:03.490
In return for your service,
please accept these gifts.

22:04.616 --> 22:09.538
As is tradition, the protectors of our world
are bestowed with great beasts.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.041
Giant goats!

22:13.208 --> 22:15.252
Look at those! They are wonderful.

22:15.419 --> 22:18.213
Korg, look at that.
Those things are beautiful.

22:18.547 --> 22:20.632
King Yakan, thank you so much.

22:20.799 --> 22:22.551
Listen, about the temple...

22:22.718 --> 22:23.886
I don't wanna talk about the temple.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.762
I know, but if we were to talk about it,
I think it's important...

22:25.929 --> 22:27.347
-It's making me sad.
-...to life and material objects...

22:27.514 --> 22:28.849
-And mad.
-Okay, I'll stop talking.

22:29.641 --> 22:30.642
Don't forget the goats.

22:30.809 --> 22:33.103
Which you accepted,
and now must take with you.

22:33.270 --> 22:34.396
No backsies.

22:36.148 --> 22:38.483
-They are beautiful.
-Yes, they are beautiful.

22:39.401 --> 22:40.944
They also scream quite a lot.

22:41.111 --> 22:42.029
They'll be fine.

22:42.988 --> 22:43.989
I am Groot.

22:44.156 --> 22:46.950
We need to find the damn remote
so we can download the distress signal!

22:47.117 --> 22:48.994
Retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?

22:49.161 --> 22:50.412
One of your goats probably ate it!

22:50.579 --> 22:52.331
Goats didn't eat the remote.
Don't be ridiculous.

22:52.497 --> 22:53.832
Well, I ain't digging through their crap.

22:53.999 --> 22:56.627
I love them!
They should live with us forever!

22:56.793 --> 22:57.920
Found the remote!

22:58.086 --> 22:59.129
I'm putting them down.

22:59.296 --> 23:00.214
-Me too.
-Is it working or not?

23:00.380 --> 23:01.757
No, it's not workin'. It's not charged.

23:01.924 --> 23:03.509
-Well, maybe you need to find a charger...
-Get out of my way!

23:03.675 --> 23:05.219
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

23:07.095 --> 23:08.805
-Korg, you okay?
-Yeah, bro. All good.

23:08.972 --> 23:11.475
All right. Everybody, just relax.
The goats are gonna be fine.

23:11.642 --> 23:13.227
If not, we can just use them
for meat...

23:15.062 --> 23:16.063
...ting people.

23:16.230 --> 23:18.273
Meeting people.
They're a great conversation starter.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.692
And I've been told you can summon them
with a special whistle...

23:20.859 --> 23:21.985
that goes something like this...

23:22.528 --> 23:24.154
No, that's not it.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.822
No, that's not it.
You have a go.

23:26.365 --> 23:27.366
No, that's not it.

23:27.533 --> 23:29.201
-Oh, hey, guys.
-Kraglin!

23:29.368 --> 23:30.327
No, that's not it.

23:30.494 --> 23:32.788
-You been here this whole time?
-Yeah, you said to stay with the ship.

23:33.247 --> 23:35.207
This is Glenda. We're married.

23:36.250 --> 23:37.251
I am Groot.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.003
What did we tell you
about jumpin' into new relationships?

23:40.170 --> 23:41.421
That I shouldn't be doing that.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.174
Yeah, you can't get married
on every single planet we land on.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.801
I am Groot.

23:46.552 --> 23:47.803
Finally!

23:47.970 --> 23:49.763
All right, here we go. Distress calls.

23:50.347 --> 23:53.141
Please help us!
The God Butcher has found us!

23:53.308 --> 23:54.434
God Butcher?

23:54.601 --> 23:56.228
He left them hanging as a warning.

23:56.395 --> 23:58.188
Look at all of these gods, murdered.

23:58.355 --> 24:01.942
Our greatest champions,
now laid to waste.

24:02.109 --> 24:03.277
The horror.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.820
Who could have done something like this?

24:05.946 --> 24:06.947
Thor, where are you?

24:07.114 --> 24:08.699
Wait, wait, wait. What was that? Go back.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.201
Play that one.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.204
-Thor, where are you?
-Sif?

24:14.371 --> 24:15.664
We need you here.

24:16.373 --> 24:18.000
My friend is in danger.
We must go at once.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.710
Start the ship, my friends.

24:19.877 --> 24:21.879
I don't know,
maybe we should split up.

24:22.045 --> 24:25.048
So many people to save,
I mean, look at all of these distress...

24:25.632 --> 24:26.633
calls.

24:30.012 --> 24:31.013
Thor.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.514
You gonna be okay?

24:32.681 --> 24:35.392
I admire your commitment to each other.
It's a beautiful thing.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.269
Alas, it's something I'll never have.

24:37.436 --> 24:38.812
Buddy, if I may...

24:39.396 --> 24:40.397
You may.

24:41.940 --> 24:44.484
After thousands of years of living,
you don't seem to know who the hell you are.

24:45.444 --> 24:46.904
I've been lost before.

24:47.905 --> 24:49.615
But then I found meaning, I found love.

24:50.866 --> 24:52.910
And yeah, it got taken from me,
and god, that hurts.

24:55.037 --> 24:57.748
But that shitty feeling
is better than feeling empty.

24:59.374 --> 25:02.878
My hope for you is that
one day you will find something...

25:03.337 --> 25:05.547
to make you feel this shitty.

25:05.714 --> 25:08.425
I have loved before. It didn't work out.

25:08.592 --> 25:12.346
They either die a grismal death
or they dump you with a handwritten letter.

25:12.513 --> 25:15.766
I don't know which is worse, but it's why
I keep everyone at arm's length.

25:18.727 --> 25:20.854
You've grown too attached.
Damn it, I knew this would happen.

25:21.021 --> 25:22.898
You must go. I'll find Sif.

25:23.649 --> 25:26.360
You answer the other calls.
The galaxy needs its Guardians.

25:26.527 --> 25:28.904
-Cool, yeah. We were just leaving...
-I know it hurts.

25:29.071 --> 25:30.781
But it's better this way.
You have to trust me.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.408
To ease the pain, why don't you...

25:34.368 --> 25:36.912
take this ship here
as a parting farewell gift?

25:37.663 --> 25:38.872
You're giving me my ship?

25:39.039 --> 25:40.374
Yes, she's yours.

25:40.541 --> 25:43.210
May you make as many memories with her
as I have.

25:43.377 --> 25:44.878
She's a temperamental old lass.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.339
Will serve you well in a tight pickle.

25:47.506 --> 25:48.632
-I'll start the ship.
-Thank you.

25:48.799 --> 25:50.092
Goodbye, old friend.

25:51.301 --> 25:53.011
A human handshake...

25:53.220 --> 25:54.972
to the Asgardian shake.

25:55.138 --> 25:57.683
Into the snake that you cannot trust.

25:58.767 --> 25:59.852
You're really dragging this out.

26:00.018 --> 26:02.855
And finish with the classic
Asgardian high one.

26:06.775 --> 26:07.943
Let's go.

26:08.110 --> 26:10.320
Take care of my crew.
This is gonna be hard for them.

26:10.487 --> 26:11.488
Hurry up!

26:11.655 --> 26:12.656
Not her.

26:12.823 --> 26:14.157
Remember what I told you.

26:15.117 --> 26:16.577
You ever feel lost...

26:17.369 --> 26:19.705
just look into the eyes
of the people that you love.

26:20.122 --> 26:22.124
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

26:26.503 --> 26:27.504
All right. Bye.

26:31.175 --> 26:33.677
For what it's worth,
let's cling to the good memories.

26:34.178 --> 26:37.973
We Asgardians say, "May you travel
with the speed of Odin's ravens.

26:38.432 --> 26:41.560
"I'll see you in Valhalla
where we shall drink mead and..."

26:43.520 --> 26:45.731
-They're gone.
-Alone again. Just me and you.

26:45.898 --> 26:47.065
Stormbreaker!

26:47.941 --> 26:50.027
Watch out, you frickin' crazy axe!

26:53.614 --> 26:54.865
So what do we do now, bro?

26:55.032 --> 26:56.408
Let's go get Sif!

27:11.882 --> 27:13.717
Who or what is that?

27:13.884 --> 27:17.012
Falligar, God of the Falligarians.

27:17.513 --> 27:19.515
One of the nicest gods you'll ever meet.

27:21.099 --> 27:22.267
Oh, no.

27:31.276 --> 27:32.986
Sif, it's me, Thor.

27:33.570 --> 27:34.571
Odinson?

27:34.988 --> 27:36.156
You're missing an arm.

27:36.490 --> 27:37.491
I'm gonna get you home.

27:37.658 --> 27:39.576
No! Leave me here.

27:39.743 --> 27:41.703
I want to die a warrior's death.

27:41.870 --> 27:43.914
On the battlefield. In battle.

27:44.081 --> 27:46.959
And then I can claim my place in Valhalla.

27:47.543 --> 27:49.419
Oh, I hate to break it to you...

27:49.586 --> 27:52.589
but for a warrior to get into Valhalla,
you have to die in the battle.

27:53.257 --> 27:55.300
-You survived.
-Oh, shit.

27:55.884 --> 27:57.678
Maybe your arm is in Valhalla.

27:59.429 --> 28:00.556
What happened here?

28:01.223 --> 28:02.641
I've been hunting a madman.

28:02.808 --> 28:04.893
I followed him here, but it was a trap.

28:05.060 --> 28:06.061
Who is this madman?

28:06.645 --> 28:08.856
The God Butcher is coming.

28:09.022 --> 28:11.358
He seeks the extinction of the gods.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.277
Asgard is next.

30:03.762 --> 30:04.805
Look, it's Thor!

30:04.972 --> 30:06.932
-Thor!
-Take Sif to the infirmary.

30:07.099 --> 30:08.100
Hey!

30:08.267 --> 30:09.393
Who'd you piss off now?

30:09.560 --> 30:11.061
This is not my fault.
I've never even seen these things...

30:11.228 --> 30:12.062
whatever the hell they are.

30:12.229 --> 30:13.397
Welcome back.

30:38.839 --> 30:40.007
Who's the new guy?

30:40.465 --> 30:42.885
That guy? You're gonna love that guy.

30:57.691 --> 30:59.610
Mjolnir! Mjolnir!

30:59.776 --> 31:00.819
It's me, Thor.

31:00.986 --> 31:02.237
Have you seen my hammer?

31:02.821 --> 31:03.822
Mjolnir, here, boy.

31:06.074 --> 31:07.326
Mjolnir?

31:11.538 --> 31:12.664
Mjolnir.

31:17.377 --> 31:19.880
You're back!

31:23.550 --> 31:24.468
Mjolnir!

31:52.371 --> 31:53.247
Excuse me.

31:53.413 --> 31:55.290
Hello. That's my hammer you've got there.

31:56.750 --> 31:58.126
And that's my look.

32:05.884 --> 32:06.885
Hey!

32:09.221 --> 32:10.389
Enough tomfoolery.

32:10.556 --> 32:12.724
Why don't you take off that mask
and reveal yourself?

32:12.891 --> 32:13.892
Come on.

32:15.811 --> 32:16.812
Hey.

32:17.437 --> 32:18.605
Jane?

32:24.152 --> 32:27.197
Let me tell you the legend of Thor and Jane.

32:28.907 --> 32:32.911
He was a God of Thunder
and she, a woman of science.

32:34.162 --> 32:36.582
And although
they were from different worlds...

32:38.375 --> 32:40.043
somehow, it just made sense.

32:41.420 --> 32:44.882
And together they embarked
on a journey of love.

32:50.554 --> 32:52.931
Thor taught Jane the way of the warrior...

32:55.058 --> 32:58.103
And Jane taught Thor the way of the people.

32:59.396 --> 33:03.650
And as time passed,
their love grew deeper and deeper.

33:06.778 --> 33:08.780
She's incredible, isn't she, Mjolnir?

33:11.533 --> 33:14.745
I need you to promise me
you'll always protect her.

33:16.455 --> 33:18.373
I love you too, buddy.

33:19.958 --> 33:23.545
And love that deep
has a way of becoming magical.

33:27.257 --> 33:29.343
Thor set his sights toward a future...

33:29.510 --> 33:31.553
and all it might hold.

33:35.432 --> 33:39.978
But the more he pondered a life with Jane,
the more he feared losing that life.

33:40.479 --> 33:42.814
And although Jane didn't want to admit it...

33:42.981 --> 33:45.317
she was scared of loss as well.

33:48.779 --> 33:51.073
And so, they built walls between them.

33:51.907 --> 33:53.992
Thor got busy saving humanity.

33:54.701 --> 33:55.786
Heimdall!

33:57.162 --> 33:59.456
And Jane got busy doing the same.

33:59.915 --> 34:01.750
Real busy.

34:01.917 --> 34:06.964
And eventually, the space between them grew
and grew until it became too wide to bear.

34:12.886 --> 34:14.263
Something had to give.

34:14.429 --> 34:18.016
I have to stay up all night
to go through this data. Okay?

34:18.183 --> 34:20.226
And I have to stay up all night
and clean all of this up.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.563
-There's two plates!
-It's two plates and two forks!

34:26.859 --> 34:28.944
And then, one night, it did give.

34:30.529 --> 34:32.155
Jane wrote a note.

34:33.407 --> 34:35.409
And Thor read that note.

34:37.202 --> 34:39.830
And their legend suddenly became myth.

34:41.415 --> 34:43.292
Or so they thought.

34:46.628 --> 34:47.880
You okay?

34:48.045 --> 34:50.882
Yeah, it's a little hot in...

34:51.800 --> 34:53.010
Startin' to feel...

34:53.260 --> 34:56.054
It's claustrophobic with the helmet.

35:00.350 --> 35:01.351
How?

35:04.479 --> 35:05.731
Can we talk about this later?

35:06.273 --> 35:07.274
Yeah, sure.

35:07.441 --> 35:08.650
Great seeing you.

35:10.402 --> 35:11.528
What?

35:17.910 --> 35:20.162
Kill all the gods.

35:58.617 --> 36:00.619
Hey. Is that the Necrosword?

36:00.786 --> 36:03.080
That's cool.
I've only ever read about it in stories.

36:03.455 --> 36:06.166
Then you know this is going to hurt.

36:06.875 --> 36:07.918
Pain.

36:08.085 --> 36:10.462
What is pain but a construct
invented by the weak?

36:10.671 --> 36:11.880
Okay, that's very sharp!

36:21.181 --> 36:22.182
Ready?

36:23.058 --> 36:26.103
Don't touch my things.

36:52.421 --> 36:54.464
Yeah, you better run, you coward.

37:14.067 --> 37:16.445
The children. They're taking the children!

37:17.404 --> 37:18.280
Mommy!

37:20.365 --> 37:21.450
Mom!

37:45.224 --> 37:47.684
Shadow monsters. Disgusting.

37:51.355 --> 37:53.607
Flew around the world twice.
Nothing.

37:53.774 --> 37:56.151
Cowards must have run away.
We'll find them.

37:59.571 --> 38:01.532
-Quite a reunion, huh?
-You're telling me.

38:01.698 --> 38:03.534
What's it been?
Like, three, four years?

38:03.825 --> 38:05.994
Eight years, seven months, and six days.

38:06.328 --> 38:07.371
I haven't forgotten...

38:07.538 --> 38:10.207
the last time I saw you, or didn't see you,
because you left.

38:10.916 --> 38:13.627
It's kind of an oversimplification
to say that I left.

38:13.794 --> 38:15.921
No, you left.
You did.

38:16.088 --> 38:17.923
You wrote me a beautiful
handwritten letter.

38:18.090 --> 38:19.258
I should know, I was there.

38:20.133 --> 38:22.761
-You weren't there, actually, hence the note.
-I was.

38:24.805 --> 38:28.100
And if you weren't there to see me leave,
then maybe it was you that left.

38:29.059 --> 38:30.435
Fair point.

38:31.144 --> 38:32.604
Not that it matters.

38:32.771 --> 38:34.314
-Like, who's keeping track, right?
-No, yeah.

38:35.190 --> 38:37.067
I suppose we both left and both got left.

38:37.693 --> 38:38.819
Now you're leaving again.

38:40.445 --> 38:43.240
Miek, we need detailed accounts
from all the witnesses.

38:43.407 --> 38:45.659
Darryl, get me all the names of the children
who have been lost.

38:46.285 --> 38:48.620
Your Majesty, my daughter has been taken,
and I don't know where she is.

38:48.787 --> 38:50.289
And she'll be found.

38:50.581 --> 38:53.208
Guys, they're bleeding.
Get them to the infirmary. Now!

38:53.375 --> 38:54.376
Darryl!

38:54.543 --> 38:58.338
Majesty, should we start working
on a performance of this entire debacle?

38:58.505 --> 39:00.007
The people need entertainment.

39:00.174 --> 39:01.884
Particularly now, in times of crisis.

39:02.050 --> 39:03.510
Particularly.

39:05.554 --> 39:06.805
I did not hear a, "No."

39:07.264 --> 39:08.473
Nor did I.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.766
-Asgard. Night.
-Yes!

39:09.933 --> 39:11.143
We open on some sleeping children.

39:15.397 --> 39:17.441
So, that's the ex-girlfriend, is it?

39:17.983 --> 39:19.151
The old ex-girlfriend.

39:19.318 --> 39:20.360
Jodie Foster.

39:20.527 --> 39:21.486
Jane Foster.

39:21.653 --> 39:22.905
The one that got away.

39:23.363 --> 39:24.573
The one that got away.

39:24.740 --> 39:25.741
That means escaped.

39:25.908 --> 39:27.492
Yeah. Yeah... Yeah.

39:27.951 --> 39:30.162
Must be hard for you
to see your ex-girlfriend...

39:30.329 --> 39:32.956
and your ex-hammer hangin' out,
and getting on so well.

39:37.169 --> 39:38.420
What you up to, bro?

39:39.463 --> 39:40.464
Come on.

39:41.006 --> 39:42.299
Come to daddy.

39:43.383 --> 39:45.302
Come on. Mjolnir.

39:46.970 --> 39:49.348
Hey! There you are.

39:49.806 --> 39:50.807
Hey.

39:51.225 --> 39:52.935
-Do you know what I think we should do?
-I was just calling you.

39:53.101 --> 39:55.604
-Start an army!
-With what? Half our soldiers are dead!

39:55.771 --> 39:57.272
Half our soldiers are always dead!

39:57.439 --> 39:58.857
-Everyone, please...
-Where are the children?

39:59.024 --> 40:00.609
...go home.
I promise you we'll have news soon.

40:00.776 --> 40:02.110
Someone needs to tell us what happened.

40:02.402 --> 40:03.779
We shall find them.

40:05.739 --> 40:07.074
-I just don't understand.
-You know what?

40:07.241 --> 40:08.450
This is all our fault.

40:08.617 --> 40:09.660
Stop it!

40:09.826 --> 40:10.953
Asgard!

40:20.003 --> 40:22.798
My friends, we must not quarrel.

40:23.757 --> 40:26.218
In times like this, we need to unite,
come together.

40:26.969 --> 40:28.804
I see what's happening here.

40:29.471 --> 40:30.806
You're afraid.

40:32.307 --> 40:33.350
Scared.

40:34.643 --> 40:35.686
Afraid.

40:35.978 --> 40:36.979
Anxious.

40:38.814 --> 40:42.651
If we are to find the children,
we must first look within ourselves.

40:43.110 --> 40:47.489
I'm sorry. Miek, it's very hard
to give a rousing speech with the... noise.

40:47.656 --> 40:48.991
-What are you doing?
-She's taking minutes.

40:49.157 --> 40:50.534
Precious minutes we don't have.

40:51.702 --> 40:52.619
You want the kids back?

40:53.704 --> 40:55.372
I'll be back in a minute.

40:56.456 --> 40:57.624
You can write that down, Miek.

41:00.836 --> 41:01.670
No!

41:10.470 --> 41:13.432
Stormbreaker, what are you doing?
Is this about Mjolnir?

41:13.765 --> 41:15.225
Everyone, out!

41:17.978 --> 41:18.979
Didn't find them.

41:19.146 --> 41:20.105
Bae, your cape's on fire.

41:20.272 --> 41:21.231
It's fine. It'll grow back.

41:21.398 --> 41:22.399
I'm invoicing you for this.

41:22.566 --> 41:23.442
Listen.

41:23.942 --> 41:25.068
What do we know about this guy?

41:25.235 --> 41:27.988
-He travels through shadows.
-And he creates monsters with them.

41:28.155 --> 41:29.698
Absolutely freaky monsters.

41:29.865 --> 41:31.742
He also wields the Necrosword.
How do I know that?

41:31.909 --> 41:33.285
Because he almost speared me
in the face with it.

41:33.452 --> 41:34.494
What's a Necrosword?

41:34.661 --> 41:37.497
It's an ancient weapon that's been passed
through hands since the dawn of time.

41:37.873 --> 41:40.209
It has the ability to slay gods...

41:40.375 --> 41:43.045
but it slowly corrupts and kills
whoever wields it, which means...

41:43.212 --> 41:46.173
-So, it infected him.
-It's infecting him. Yes. It must be.

41:46.465 --> 41:50.844
So basically, we're up against a cursed,
shadow-zombie kidnapper.

41:51.220 --> 41:52.638
Awesome. When do we leave?

41:52.804 --> 41:53.805
Thor.

41:54.598 --> 41:55.641
Can you see me?

41:55.807 --> 41:56.975
Floating head alert.

41:57.142 --> 41:58.977
It's Astrid. Heimdall's son.

41:59.144 --> 42:00.771
Astrid, are you okay?

42:00.938 --> 42:02.940
I no longer go by the name Astrid.

42:03.106 --> 42:05.067
I'm now known as Axl.

42:05.234 --> 42:07.361
He's a singer from a popular band
I heard on Earth.

42:07.528 --> 42:08.695
-G N' R.
-Astrid...

42:08.862 --> 42:10.781
your father gave you
a very tough Viking name...

42:10.948 --> 42:12.449
and I intend to honor his wishes.

42:12.616 --> 42:13.575
-Axl.
-Astrid.

42:13.742 --> 42:14.910
-I said Axl.
-Astrid.

42:15.077 --> 42:17.204
-Axl!
-It's asshole. Now listen to him!

42:17.371 --> 42:19.957
All right, fine, Axl. Where are you?

42:20.123 --> 42:23.335
I'm not sure. I don't know how to use
my magic eyes yet.

42:23.502 --> 42:24.878
Your father taught me
and I'm gonna teach you.

42:25.045 --> 42:27.506
I need you to focus and hold out your hand.

42:27.965 --> 42:30.092
Okay, good. Now focus.

42:30.259 --> 42:31.426
Close your eyes.

42:37.224 --> 42:38.433
Thor!

42:40.394 --> 42:41.687
Hey, how's it going, kids?

42:41.854 --> 42:43.689
"How's it going?" Look where we are.

42:43.856 --> 42:45.774
We're in a cage made of spikes.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.068
Yes, right. Not good. Yeah.

42:48.235 --> 42:49.236
Are you gonna do something?

42:49.403 --> 42:50.988
Yes. Yes, I am, but just not right now.

42:51.154 --> 42:53.156
I'm the vision ghost. Look.

42:54.575 --> 42:56.243
-See?
-What will happen to us?

42:57.035 --> 42:59.955
Who can tell? I mean,
this is a very, very bad situation.

43:00.122 --> 43:02.541
You know,
the good news is you're Asgardians.

43:02.708 --> 43:04.751
So, if you die, you'll end up in Valhalla.

43:04.918 --> 43:06.086
Oh, my God. Go away.

43:06.253 --> 43:07.337
Wait, wait. Listen.

43:09.506 --> 43:12.384
Okay. It's all right, children.
Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.

43:12.551 --> 43:15.762
Listen, I've got a plan, okay? I'm putting
together a really, really good team.

43:15.929 --> 43:19.683
We've got Uncle Korg, King Valkyrie...

43:20.642 --> 43:24.188
my ex-girlfriend, Jane, which is a whole
other story I won't bore you with, okay?

43:24.354 --> 43:26.315
But it is a top-notch team...

43:26.481 --> 43:28.442
and we're gonna have you home
before you know it.

43:28.609 --> 43:29.735
Yeah.

43:37.117 --> 43:38.202
I know where you are.

43:41.330 --> 43:42.581
I'm gonna get you out of here.

43:42.789 --> 43:45.250
I'm scared. We all are.

43:46.126 --> 43:48.420
Thor! Thor! Save us.

43:52.049 --> 43:53.217
Get me out of here.
You take care, okay?

43:53.383 --> 43:55.135
Take care. I'll see you soon.
All right?

43:55.302 --> 43:56.553
Axl, get me out of here!

43:58.096 --> 43:59.139
They're in the Shadow Realm.

43:59.306 --> 44:00.307
How do you know?

44:00.474 --> 44:03.018
The heavy atmosphere there
has a darkness like no other.

44:03.185 --> 44:05.145
It's as if color fears to tread.
It's unmistakable.

44:05.938 --> 44:07.606
Well then, if it's color we need...

44:08.065 --> 44:09.566
let's bring the rainbow.

44:11.568 --> 44:13.445
"Bring the rainbow"?
Is that a catchphrase or something?

44:13.612 --> 44:15.197
She's only been a Thor for a minute.

44:15.364 --> 44:18.033
I mean, saving lives, she's quite good at.
But the rest of it, she needs work.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.035
-How many catchphrases have there been?
-A lot.

44:21.745 --> 44:23.580
Yep. Jumped the gun.

44:23.747 --> 44:26.750
Hang on, he moves through shadows
and he's going to the Shadow Realm...

44:26.917 --> 44:28.460
it seems like that's where
he's going to be the most powerful.

44:28.627 --> 44:30.587
You're right. We can't just go
marching in there. It could be a trap.

44:30.754 --> 44:32.089
We'd be endangering the children.

44:32.256 --> 44:34.091
We need reinforcements.
We must raise an army.

44:34.258 --> 44:35.509
Are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

44:35.676 --> 44:36.885
-I'm thinking it.
-What are we thinking?

44:37.052 --> 44:38.428
-Thinking what?
-I'm thinking it too.

44:38.595 --> 44:39.721
Omnipotence City.

44:41.181 --> 44:42.599
What's Omnipotence City?

44:42.766 --> 44:44.935
It's the home of the most powerful gods
in the universe.

44:45.102 --> 44:46.937
We could pull together
the greatest team ever.

44:47.104 --> 44:49.273
We could recruit Ra, Hercules...

44:49.439 --> 44:50.524
Tūmatauenga.

44:50.691 --> 44:54.361
Quetzalcoatl, maybe. And Zeus,
the oldest and wisest of them all.

44:54.528 --> 44:55.779
Did you say Zeus?

44:55.946 --> 44:56.780
Yeah, Zeus.

44:56.864 --> 44:58.240
Like, the Zeus. Zeus-Zeus?

44:58.448 --> 44:59.700
I'm not sure if he has a second name.

44:59.867 --> 45:02.077
Do you think my god will be there,
Ninny of the Nonny?

45:02.244 --> 45:04.204
You never know, Korg. But if they are,
we'll ask them to join our team.

45:04.371 --> 45:05.205
Yes.

45:05.372 --> 45:06.373
Stormbreaker.

45:07.666 --> 45:09.042
All right. Calm down. Relax.

45:09.209 --> 45:12.045
No, no, no, mate, we are not traveling
in Stormbreaker's janky Bifrost.

45:12.212 --> 45:13.046
Look what just happened.

45:13.213 --> 45:15.465
We can't exactly go in your tiny, little,
flying portal horse, can we?

45:15.632 --> 45:16.508
We won't all fit.

45:16.675 --> 45:17.968
What are you talking about?
Warsong's awesome.

45:18.135 --> 45:19.261
Stormbreaker's awesome too.

45:19.428 --> 45:20.721
Stormbreaker just needs a conduit.

45:20.888 --> 45:22.264
Anything that can handle space travel.

45:22.472 --> 45:23.682
I love it when she talks shop.

45:23.849 --> 45:24.975
It has the power to get us there...

45:25.142 --> 45:28.770
it just needs something to focus that energy
so it's not so unpredictable.

45:28.937 --> 45:30.814
You know, if we had a ship
we could harness it...

45:30.981 --> 45:32.482
and use Stormbreaker as a power source.

45:32.649 --> 45:34.318
-Oh, like an engine.
-Like an engine.

45:34.484 --> 45:35.736
You need a ship?

45:36.028 --> 45:37.404
I've got a ship.

45:41.867 --> 45:43.118
Get rid of all those seats.

45:43.285 --> 45:45.329
And you guys,
go tie those goats to the front.

45:45.495 --> 45:46.747
We leave in 15 minutes.

45:46.914 --> 45:48.749
Essentials only, everyone.

45:48.916 --> 45:50.459
That's essential.

45:50.876 --> 45:52.044
Fifteen minutes to departure!

45:52.211 --> 45:53.754
Well, you moved on quick, didn't you?

45:55.672 --> 45:57.132
You're some piece of work.

45:58.634 --> 46:00.469
-Oh, hey!
-Hey.

46:00.677 --> 46:03.222
-Just catching up with an old friend.
-Yeah.

46:03.388 --> 46:05.140
I've been meaning to apologize.

46:05.641 --> 46:08.602
Sorta acting a little weird before.
I just haven't really been myself lately.

46:08.769 --> 46:10.229
You know, kind of...

46:10.395 --> 46:13.357
Trying to figure out who I am,
and just felt a little bit lost.

46:13.524 --> 46:16.109
And then, all of a sudden,
I see you dressed as me...

46:16.276 --> 46:17.569
and it was kind of...

46:17.736 --> 46:19.196
It's a lot for me, too.

46:19.696 --> 46:22.533
So, how did you guys get together?
How did this happen?

46:23.158 --> 46:26.203
I swear I heard Mjolnir call to me.

46:26.370 --> 46:27.871
Ah, did it?

46:28.038 --> 46:29.706
And so I came here to investigate...

46:29.873 --> 46:32.584
and its pieces started
glowing and swirling, and then...

46:32.835 --> 46:33.836
Crazy.

46:34.127 --> 46:35.420
...Thor.

46:35.879 --> 46:39.007
Well, you know what,
it looks good on you, it works, so...

46:43.095 --> 46:44.096
Just checking.

46:47.975 --> 46:49.142
See you later.

46:49.309 --> 46:51.436
Five minutes to departure!

46:55.524 --> 46:56.692
What?

46:57.150 --> 46:58.527
We were just talking.

47:09.705 --> 47:11.999
Mommy, don't leave me.

47:12.416 --> 47:14.001
Don't be afraid.

47:15.586 --> 47:17.087
Even when I'm gone, honey...

47:18.881 --> 47:20.674
You won't be alone.

47:23.385 --> 47:25.387
And whatever happens...

47:27.222 --> 47:28.974
never stop fighting.

47:29.808 --> 47:31.351
Never stop fighting.

47:45.449 --> 47:47.201
Hey. You all right?

47:47.534 --> 47:48.535
Great.

47:50.078 --> 47:51.496
The sink would say otherwise.

47:53.332 --> 47:54.917
You think I really should be coming?

47:55.125 --> 47:56.502
I'm not getting any better.

47:56.668 --> 47:58.378
You're a Thor. Of course, you should come.

47:58.795 --> 48:00.130
Besides, what else are you gonna do?

48:00.297 --> 48:01.590
You're a Viking now.

48:01.757 --> 48:03.884
Means you pretty much
have to die in battle...

48:04.051 --> 48:06.136
and it needs to be devastatingly painful.

48:06.303 --> 48:07.679
Otherwise, you don't get into Valhalla.

48:08.222 --> 48:09.348
That's my plan.

48:09.515 --> 48:11.767
What about, you know, kinging and stuff?

48:11.934 --> 48:14.520
I love being king.
I love my people...

48:14.686 --> 48:16.063
but it's all meetings and raven-mail...

48:16.230 --> 48:17.856
and meetings that could've been raven-mail.

48:18.023 --> 48:19.191
I miss fighting.

48:19.358 --> 48:20.442
I miss my sisters.

48:20.609 --> 48:22.528
Which is why you need to come,
'cause I need one.

48:23.695 --> 48:24.655
Okay, we should go.

48:24.988 --> 48:26.031
You packed?

48:26.615 --> 48:27.616
Are you packed?

48:29.493 --> 48:30.327
Yes!

48:32.913 --> 48:33.956
A hand grenade?

48:34.122 --> 48:35.666
No. It's a portable speaker.

48:42.464 --> 48:43.465
Let's go.

48:44.341 --> 48:47.928
If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps?

48:48.262 --> 48:49.388
I got you.

48:52.182 --> 48:53.809
My fellow Asgardians...

48:54.226 --> 48:58.313
Wish us well, for we shall travel
with the speed of Odin's ravens.

48:58.605 --> 49:01.191
We will return with children.

49:02.776 --> 49:04.278
Many children.

49:04.444 --> 49:05.821
And then we shall feast!

49:06.154 --> 49:07.197
Not on the children.

49:07.948 --> 49:09.700
We do not do that anymore.

49:09.867 --> 49:12.369
Those were dark times. Shameful times.

49:13.161 --> 49:14.454
Okay, we should go.

50:01.043 --> 50:02.669
So, you still rollerblading?

50:02.836 --> 50:04.588
No. No. You?

50:04.755 --> 50:06.006
Oh, yeah. Every weekend.

50:06.173 --> 50:08.050
Once you blade, you never fade.
Right, Korg?

50:08.217 --> 50:09.092
Skate mates for life!

50:09.301 --> 50:11.220
-Hey, can I run something by you?
-Yeah.

50:11.386 --> 50:12.387
So, I was thinking...

50:12.554 --> 50:15.849
when we get to the bad guy, what about
if I had, like, a cool catchphrase?

50:16.642 --> 50:17.935
Like, "Eat this hammer!"

50:18.560 --> 50:21.271
Or, like, "Check out my hammer."

50:21.897 --> 50:23.565
Like, what about...

50:23.732 --> 50:25.609
No...
I'm workshopping it.

50:25.776 --> 50:28.111
No, they are all really good.
Mine is...

50:28.278 --> 50:30.030
"This ends here and now."

50:30.197 --> 50:31.365
Oh, that's such a good one.

50:31.532 --> 50:32.699
Took me a long time to perfect it.

50:32.866 --> 50:34.117
You'll get there.
You just need to practice.

50:34.284 --> 50:35.702
Just my first bad guy.

50:35.869 --> 50:37.162
You never forget your first.

50:40.541 --> 50:41.542
Yeah.

50:42.167 --> 50:43.460
So, you got a girlfriend?

50:44.711 --> 50:47.631
No, no. Too busy, don't have time,
you know?

50:48.215 --> 50:50.092
Just the work and everything.

50:50.259 --> 50:52.261
Cool. Gonna check this place out.

50:56.807 --> 50:57.808
So cool.

50:57.975 --> 50:58.976
Who's so cool?

50:59.142 --> 51:00.602
The buildings are cool.

51:01.144 --> 51:02.521
-What's happening there?
-Where?

51:02.688 --> 51:05.148
Am I sensing feelings?

51:05.774 --> 51:07.442
Feelings? What, for Jane?

51:07.609 --> 51:09.069
No, don't be ridiculous. Feelings.

51:09.236 --> 51:10.988
The last time we had feelings were...

51:11.154 --> 51:12.739
long time ago. Long, long gone.
I think you...

51:12.906 --> 51:14.449
-Maybe you have feelings.
-Right.

51:15.576 --> 51:17.411
-Mate, relax. We're on the same team.
-I don't know.

51:17.578 --> 51:19.955
Know exactly what team we're on, okay?

51:20.122 --> 51:21.498
Team Jane.

51:25.794 --> 51:28.297
Thing about Thor
is that he always bounces back.

51:28.797 --> 51:30.215
-Yeah.
-Like when Hela stole his hammer...

51:30.382 --> 51:33.260
he went and built an axe which was forged
in the heart of a dying star.

51:36.513 --> 51:39.057
And the same axe was used
to cut off Thanos' head.

51:41.226 --> 51:42.519
That's a good one.

51:45.564 --> 51:47.816
What a neat story!

51:50.027 --> 51:52.946
With all this talk
about chopping off heads...

51:53.113 --> 51:54.448
I wanna have a go.

51:55.282 --> 51:56.283
What's this?

52:01.622 --> 52:04.166
This is Octy.
Hello, Octy.

52:04.499 --> 52:06.001
How are you?

52:06.460 --> 52:08.420
You know what Octy loves?

52:08.879 --> 52:10.881
Having his head ripped off!

52:14.927 --> 52:17.471
What?
You liked it a second ago.

52:18.722 --> 52:20.057
All right, all right, all right.

52:20.349 --> 52:21.350
Octy's gone.

52:25.312 --> 52:26.355
Come on.

52:27.189 --> 52:28.440
I'm scared.

52:28.982 --> 52:30.192
Look at you.

52:31.401 --> 52:34.363
I knew a little girl just like you.

52:34.905 --> 52:38.534
And she was brave,
and she was smart...

52:40.285 --> 52:43.830
and funny and she liked to draw.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.293
Let me ask you a question...

52:49.837 --> 52:51.088
about gods.

52:51.630 --> 52:53.674
They're meant to protect you, right?

52:54.341 --> 52:55.676
Well, where are they?

52:55.843 --> 52:58.554
-Thor is on his way.
-Yeah!

52:58.720 --> 53:01.390
Yes. I'm counting on that.

53:02.015 --> 53:04.184
That's why you're here.

53:07.646 --> 53:10.440
It's invitation only, so we're gonna have
to keep a low profile and blend in.

53:10.607 --> 53:13.193
Luckily, disguises are my specialty.

53:13.944 --> 53:14.987
Greek philosopher?

53:15.571 --> 53:16.613
Got us these.

53:17.197 --> 53:18.198
What are those?

53:18.365 --> 53:19.366
Actual disguises.

53:20.158 --> 53:22.244
They're the cloaks of the emotion gods.

53:22.619 --> 53:26.081
Every color signifies a different emotion.

53:26.623 --> 53:28.000
Where are the emotion gods?

53:28.292 --> 53:29.585
Don't ask.

53:32.921 --> 53:34.131
Holy shit.

53:43.223 --> 53:45.142
Welcome to the Golden Temple, kids.

53:45.309 --> 53:48.520
This is where the most powerful creator gods
in the universe hang out.

53:51.440 --> 53:55.277
There's the god of magic,
the god of dreams...

53:55.444 --> 53:56.445
the god of carpentry.

53:56.820 --> 53:57.905
Look at that one.

53:58.071 --> 53:59.656
Oh, yes. That's Bao, god of dumplings.

54:00.115 --> 54:01.825
-Hey, Bao!
-Bao.

54:01.992 --> 54:02.993
Look up there, guys!

54:03.160 --> 54:05.037
That's the Kronan god, Ninny of the Nonny.

54:05.621 --> 54:07.331
Hey, Ninny Nonny!

54:17.591 --> 54:20.385
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

54:20.552 --> 54:23.138
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

54:49.831 --> 54:50.958
Yes.

54:52.167 --> 54:53.585
I am Zeus!

54:58.131 --> 54:59.341
There he is!

54:59.508 --> 55:01.468
The man, the myth, the legend.

55:01.885 --> 55:02.803
I don't know if you know this...

55:02.970 --> 55:05.055
but I base a lot of what I do
on this guy.

55:05.222 --> 55:06.849
He's the god of lightning,
I'm the god of thunder.

55:07.015 --> 55:09.059
-Huge source of inspiration.
-That's really good.

55:09.226 --> 55:11.812
You should lead with that
when you ask him for an army.

55:12.813 --> 55:15.315
How do we get up there?
Do we just, like, fly?

55:15.482 --> 55:16.817
No, we can't interrupt him
in the middle of an entrance.

55:16.984 --> 55:18.610
He's famous for his entrances.

55:18.777 --> 55:20.571
Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt!

55:21.196 --> 55:22.197
Yes!

55:24.908 --> 55:26.285
Zeus!

55:35.586 --> 55:37.713
Yes! Thunderbolt!

55:45.470 --> 55:46.346
Order.

55:47.055 --> 55:48.140
Order!

55:50.017 --> 55:52.436
Silence! Silence!

55:56.690 --> 55:58.525
I hereby open...

55:59.193 --> 56:02.404
this holy council of the god.

56:02.988 --> 56:07.367
Where we have many, many serious matter
to be talk about.

56:07.826 --> 56:08.911
Such as...

56:09.828 --> 56:12.039
where are we going to hold this year's orgy?

56:12.748 --> 56:14.041
Is this guy for real?

56:14.208 --> 56:15.375
Honestly, I'm not mad at it.

56:15.542 --> 56:17.211
Yeah, I'm sure he has a point, okay?

56:17.711 --> 56:18.712
Sorry.

56:18.879 --> 56:20.047
So now we're going to announce the winner...

56:20.214 --> 56:25.302
of the, "Most human souls sacrificed
in the name of a god."

56:25.636 --> 56:26.970
Okay, maybe he's not that great.

56:27.137 --> 56:28.472
Oh, no, not good.

56:28.639 --> 56:30.349
No, I don't think it's gonna get
any better than this.

56:30.516 --> 56:31.934
Look, these gods aren't gonna help.

56:32.100 --> 56:34.561
But that thunderbolt,
I think that might be of use.

56:34.728 --> 56:36.647
Jane, you go right.
Thor, you go left.

56:36.813 --> 56:39.233
We bum-rush him, take the bolt,
ding-dong.

56:39.399 --> 56:41.485
-All right, let's go get it!
-No, no, no, wait!

56:41.652 --> 56:43.320
There's no ding-donging or bum-rushing.

56:43.487 --> 56:44.947
Especially not Zeus' bum.

56:45.113 --> 56:46.615
When the time is right,
I'm gonna talk to him.

56:46.782 --> 56:47.616
The time is right now.

56:47.783 --> 56:48.700
Time is not right now.

56:48.867 --> 56:50.160
Who is talking?

56:50.327 --> 56:51.370
Who is talking?

56:51.537 --> 56:52.829
-These guys.
-Korg, shut up.

56:52.996 --> 56:55.415
Do you have something to say to the group?

56:55.791 --> 56:56.792
Sorry.

56:56.959 --> 56:59.670
I'm bashing heads in 60 seconds,
so speak fast.

56:59.837 --> 57:01.296
Literally, heads will roll.

57:02.089 --> 57:03.382
Who are you two?

57:04.258 --> 57:05.259
Hello.

57:05.843 --> 57:08.345
Let me be the first to say it is an honor
and a privilege to be...

57:08.512 --> 57:09.680
No, I can't hear you.

57:09.847 --> 57:11.181
Why don't you take the stage?

57:11.640 --> 57:13.225
The stage down there?

57:13.392 --> 57:17.646
Well, yes. You see the area
that looks very much like a stage?

57:19.189 --> 57:20.190
Got ya.

57:27.406 --> 57:28.365
Coming through.

57:29.575 --> 57:30.826
Oops. Sorry.

57:30.993 --> 57:31.994
Good luck, bro.

57:39.835 --> 57:41.128
Mighty Zeus!

57:41.795 --> 57:42.796
Wow!

57:43.380 --> 57:44.965
Gods of the universe...

57:45.465 --> 57:48.719
I come here to ask for your help,
to raise an army.

57:49.011 --> 57:52.014
There's a maniac called the God Butcher
who seeks to end us all.

57:52.181 --> 57:53.682
His destruction is everywhere.

57:53.849 --> 57:55.851
Entire planets, realms...

57:56.018 --> 57:57.477
have been left completely unprotected.

57:57.644 --> 57:59.771
He's left nothing but chaos in his wake.

58:00.189 --> 58:01.732
But I know where he is...

58:01.899 --> 58:06.028
and with your help we can crush him
before he kills anyone else.

58:06.570 --> 58:07.863
That guy...

58:08.030 --> 58:10.908
he killed a couple of low-level god.

58:11.241 --> 58:12.242
Boo-hoo.

58:12.409 --> 58:13.744
If that's all...

58:13.911 --> 58:15.037
pretty boy...

58:15.204 --> 58:16.955
you go back to your seat
and you be quiet.

58:17.122 --> 58:20.125
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Did you not hear any of what I just said?

58:20.709 --> 58:22.252
He's murdering en masse.

58:22.419 --> 58:24.505
I tell you one time...

58:24.671 --> 58:25.672
now, you shut up.

58:25.839 --> 58:26.840
You be quiet.

58:27.007 --> 58:29.635
Because you are this close
to being uninvited to the orgy.

58:29.801 --> 58:32.095
Zeus, we must do something.

58:32.262 --> 58:34.056
You cannot come to the orgy!

58:34.223 --> 58:36.141
-You have to listen to us!
-That's it!

58:36.642 --> 58:37.684
Shackle!

58:40.229 --> 58:41.772
Your Highness, whenever you're ready,
you just tell me.

58:41.939 --> 58:43.106
-We go on my signal.
-Mm-hmm.

58:43.273 --> 58:44.274
What is the signal?

58:44.441 --> 58:45.442
It'll be, "Go."

58:49.613 --> 58:50.906
Let's see who you are.

58:51.073 --> 58:52.658
I take off your disguise.

58:52.824 --> 58:53.784
And flick!

59:01.917 --> 59:03.627
You flicked too hard, damn it!

59:06.171 --> 59:08.423
Should we help him?

59:08.590 --> 59:09.925
I mean, eventually.

59:10.092 --> 59:11.134
Grape?

59:11.301 --> 59:12.970
Looks like a shy courgette.

59:13.136 --> 59:14.888
And what about the others?

59:15.055 --> 59:16.181
We take off their disguise too.

59:16.348 --> 59:17.558
Oh, no. No. Don't flick us.

59:17.724 --> 59:18.725
It's cool.

59:19.476 --> 59:20.352
Disguise gone!

59:20.435 --> 59:21.311
Disguise off. Cool?

59:21.478 --> 59:22.771
Asgardians.

59:23.188 --> 59:25.732
I thought we'd seen the last of you
when Odin died.

59:27.234 --> 59:29.528
You are Thor...

59:29.903 --> 59:31.530
the God of Thunder.

59:32.239 --> 59:35.492
But is not thunder
just the sound of lightning?

59:37.786 --> 59:38.996
Good one, Dad.

59:39.162 --> 59:40.372
Zeus, this is bigger than us.

59:40.539 --> 59:42.541
He's taken Asgardian children.

59:42.749 --> 59:45.961
Who do you think we are?
The god police?

59:46.837 --> 59:49.798
Every god watches over their own peoples.

59:50.299 --> 59:52.843
Nothing more, nothing less.

59:53.010 --> 59:54.678
Asgardian problems...

59:55.596 --> 59:57.764
are Asgardian problems.

59:58.390 --> 1:00:00.392
How the mighty have fallen.

1:00:00.559 --> 1:00:02.728
My hero, Zeus...

1:00:02.895 --> 1:00:03.896
afraid.

1:00:16.158 --> 1:00:17.451
Couple of thing.

1:00:18.118 --> 1:00:21.121
One, yes, I am scared.

1:00:21.663 --> 1:00:23.999
Gorr has the Necrosword...

1:00:24.166 --> 1:00:26.293
which means he could kill us.

1:00:26.835 --> 1:00:28.212
Not good. Two...

1:00:28.378 --> 1:00:30.297
I know you're trying
to do the right thing.

1:00:30.464 --> 1:00:31.632
I understand.

1:00:31.798 --> 1:00:34.009
But all you do is cause a panic.

1:00:34.426 --> 1:00:36.136
Panic is not good.

1:00:36.303 --> 1:00:37.804
We are safe here.

1:00:37.971 --> 1:00:40.349
You, my friend. You are safe here.

1:00:40.891 --> 1:00:42.559
So, chill, baby cake.

1:00:43.018 --> 1:00:45.270
Have some wine, have some grape.

1:00:45.437 --> 1:00:46.897
Anything goes here...

1:00:47.064 --> 1:00:49.316
in Omnipotence City.

1:00:50.067 --> 1:00:52.528
Three, don't talk back to Zeus.

1:00:52.903 --> 1:00:55.030
I flicked too hard.
I put your clothes back on.

1:00:56.782 --> 1:00:58.242
Now I put your clothes back on!

1:00:58.408 --> 1:00:59.284
Flick, flick.

1:00:59.368 --> 1:01:02.120
For this is the Golden Temple of the god.

1:01:02.621 --> 1:01:04.748
It's not a rudie-nudie festival.

1:01:05.249 --> 1:01:07.835
If you're not gonna help us,
then at least let us use your weapon.

1:01:08.001 --> 1:01:09.461
We need your lightning bolt.

1:01:10.087 --> 1:01:12.339
My lightning bolt is called Thunderbolt.

1:01:12.506 --> 1:01:15.717
So, I think to use
somebody's secret weapon like this...

1:01:15.884 --> 1:01:18.428
that you should at least get the name right
when you ask.

1:01:19.054 --> 1:01:20.764
Can I borrow Thunderbolt?

1:01:20.931 --> 1:01:21.932
Thunderbolt!

1:01:49.543 --> 1:01:50.544
No!

1:01:54.173 --> 1:01:55.883
Do not worry.

1:01:56.550 --> 1:01:58.260
The God Butcher...

1:01:58.886 --> 1:02:00.846
he will not reach Eternity.

1:02:01.180 --> 1:02:02.222
Eternity?

1:02:02.389 --> 1:02:04.099
What does he mean, reach Eternity?

1:02:07.519 --> 1:02:09.313
Oh, shit.

1:02:11.857 --> 1:02:16.320
Eternity is a very powerful being
at the center of the universe.

1:02:17.112 --> 1:02:20.073
It will grant the desire
of the first person who reaches it.

1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:22.075
So, it's like a wishing well?

1:02:24.578 --> 1:02:27.331
What do you think a guy called
the God Butcher would wish for?

1:02:27.497 --> 1:02:30.417
If he seeks the Altar of Eternity,
that means he could wipe us out at once.

1:02:30.584 --> 1:02:32.169
Zeus, we must act now.

1:02:32.336 --> 1:02:34.087
He's not going to make it.

1:02:34.254 --> 1:02:35.547
He doesn't have the key.

1:02:36.131 --> 1:02:37.883
Is this the purpose of the gods?

1:02:38.050 --> 1:02:40.719
To hide away in a golden palace like cowards?

1:02:40.886 --> 1:02:42.346
Maybe we have lost our way.

1:02:42.930 --> 1:02:44.932
You know what?
We'll stop him ourselves.

1:02:45.098 --> 1:02:47.267
I am afraid I cannot allow that.

1:02:47.643 --> 1:02:49.978
This is a secret place...

1:02:50.145 --> 1:02:51.939
known only to the gods.

1:02:52.314 --> 1:02:54.024
You know where we are.

1:02:54.191 --> 1:02:57.819
The God Butcher could use you
to find us.

1:02:58.570 --> 1:02:59.905
This is no good.

1:03:01.073 --> 1:03:02.074
So now...

1:03:03.325 --> 1:03:04.826
you must stay.

1:03:06.203 --> 1:03:07.204
Guards!

1:03:09.873 --> 1:03:10.874
Hey.

1:03:11.041 --> 1:03:11.959
Can we do my plan now?

1:03:12.125 --> 1:03:13.961
Yes. Rush his bum.

1:03:14.127 --> 1:03:15.128
Hell, yeah!

1:03:18.215 --> 1:03:19.550
You didn't say, "Go."

1:03:24.221 --> 1:03:25.556
Coming, guys!

1:03:35.774 --> 1:03:36.775
Thor, catch!

1:03:39.945 --> 1:03:40.946
Korg!

1:04:00.424 --> 1:04:01.550
Val, duck!

1:04:07.014 --> 1:04:08.015
Korg!

1:04:10.225 --> 1:04:11.059
Thor.

1:04:12.811 --> 1:04:14.813
Oh, no. No. Korg!

1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:18.901
Thor, I'm perishing!

1:04:23.739 --> 1:04:24.865
Zeus!

1:04:26.950 --> 1:04:28.410
You're next, Odinson!

1:04:36.210 --> 1:04:38.420
That's the sound of lightning.

1:04:45.636 --> 1:04:46.803
No!

1:04:47.554 --> 1:04:49.556
Korgi. Korgi!

1:04:49.723 --> 1:04:50.724
Thor.

1:04:50.891 --> 1:04:52.226
-Korgi?
-I'm down here.

1:04:52.392 --> 1:04:54.686
Where? Where are you?
I'm gonna get you out. It's okay.

1:04:54.895 --> 1:04:56.104
-Korg. Korgi!
-Here I am!

1:04:56.271 --> 1:04:57.231
I didn't die!

1:04:57.397 --> 1:04:59.483
Oh, my God.
Yes! You're alive!

1:04:59.650 --> 1:05:02.152
Turns out the only part of a Kronan
that's alive is his mouth.

1:05:02.653 --> 1:05:04.613
Korgi, listen.
I need you to call the goats.

1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:05.697
I'll do my best.

1:05:05.864 --> 1:05:07.199
Guard him with your life.

1:05:07.366 --> 1:05:08.200
I will.

1:05:08.367 --> 1:05:09.284
Ready to go for a ride?

1:05:13.705 --> 1:05:14.915
Now you've got my six.

1:05:15.499 --> 1:05:16.625
Eight o'clock, Val.

1:05:17.584 --> 1:05:18.627
7:48.

1:05:20.045 --> 1:05:21.338
I can do this, damn it.

1:05:22.130 --> 1:05:23.465
No, that's not it. No, that's not it.

1:05:23.632 --> 1:05:24.675
Nope.

1:05:24.842 --> 1:05:27.261
Come on, Korg, purse those lips.

1:05:40.983 --> 1:05:41.984
I did it!

1:06:19.396 --> 1:06:22.065
And then the goat boat came in,
rescued us...

1:06:22.232 --> 1:06:24.693
and we flew out the window.
The end.

1:06:24.860 --> 1:06:26.403
Another classic Thor adventure.

1:06:27.029 --> 1:06:28.614
I can't believe you killed Zeus.

1:06:28.780 --> 1:06:31.658
Well, you know what they say,
never meet your heroes.

1:06:33.410 --> 1:06:35.662
But what's important is
we are on our way to you right now.

1:06:36.163 --> 1:06:37.789
How are you guys doing?
Are you okay?

1:06:37.956 --> 1:06:39.541
We're all right. A little scared.

1:06:39.708 --> 1:06:41.793
Well, listen, I know
what it's like to be scared.

1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:43.545
And I'll tell you,
when I was your age...

1:06:43.712 --> 1:06:45.339
I don't think I would have been
as brave as you.

1:06:45.506 --> 1:06:46.507
Really?

1:06:46.673 --> 1:06:49.510
In fact, might just be
the bravest Asgardians that I've ever met.

1:06:49.676 --> 1:06:50.802
All of you.

1:06:50.969 --> 1:06:52.888
So I need you to
keep being brave, all right?

1:06:53.055 --> 1:06:55.224
And take care of each other.
You're a team now.

1:06:55.390 --> 1:06:56.808
Team Kids in a Cage.

1:06:58.435 --> 1:06:59.478
Can you do that?

1:07:00.103 --> 1:07:02.231
Yeah. I think we can do that.

1:07:02.981 --> 1:07:03.982
I know you can.

1:07:07.486 --> 1:07:08.529
Right?

1:07:08.946 --> 1:07:10.113
-Thor?
-Yeah.

1:07:10.572 --> 1:07:11.949
I'm glad I met my hero.

1:07:12.115 --> 1:07:13.283
Oh, thanks, buddy.

1:07:17.704 --> 1:07:19.373
How are the children?

1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:21.166
As you can imagine, they're a little bit
scared because they're kids...

1:07:21.333 --> 1:07:22.960
but I told them that
everything is going to plan.

1:07:23.126 --> 1:07:24.044
Oh, so you lied to them?

1:07:24.211 --> 1:07:25.128
We still have a plan?

1:07:25.295 --> 1:07:26.296
-Yes, there's a plan.
-There's no plan.

1:07:26.463 --> 1:07:28.590
-There is a plan.
-No. There's no plan.

1:07:28.757 --> 1:07:30.801
We failed to raise a god army...

1:07:30.968 --> 1:07:31.969
Korg is dead.

1:07:32.135 --> 1:07:33.220
-He's not dead.
-I'm not dead.

1:07:33.387 --> 1:07:34.847
Well, he's a head. And you...

1:07:35.013 --> 1:07:36.390
you got properly humiliated.

1:07:36.557 --> 1:07:38.851
No, I got properly naked,
which I am okay with.

1:07:39.017 --> 1:07:40.602
-Jane?
-I was okay with it.

1:07:40.769 --> 1:07:41.895
-Korg?
-I loved it.

1:07:42.062 --> 1:07:43.856
The point is,
we are going into the Shadow Realm...

1:07:44.022 --> 1:07:45.315
weaker than we were before.

1:07:45.482 --> 1:07:46.775
I mean, we're gonna die.

1:07:46.942 --> 1:07:48.402
-No one's gonna die, okay?
-Really?

1:07:48.569 --> 1:07:50.821
Everything is fine.
We did great back there.

1:07:50.988 --> 1:07:52.906
-We killed Zeus!
-You killed Zeus.

1:07:53.073 --> 1:07:55.993
I mean, that may or may not be catastrophic
for the whole universe...

1:07:56.159 --> 1:07:58.036
and, sure, the entire god kingdom
is probably going...

1:07:58.203 --> 1:07:59.580
to hunt us down
for the rest of our days...

1:07:59.746 --> 1:08:02.249
but listen, you stole this beautiful weapon.

1:08:02.416 --> 1:08:04.293
All right? This is the army right here.

1:08:04.459 --> 1:08:07.462
It's sleek, it's slender,
it's powerful, it's beautiful...

1:08:09.548 --> 1:08:11.383
For you. I love it for you, Valkyrie.

1:08:11.550 --> 1:08:13.051
I mean, it's not really what I'm into...

1:08:13.218 --> 1:08:15.095
'cause I've got my weapon out there.

1:08:15.262 --> 1:08:16.889
Can I borrow that for a second?

1:08:19.892 --> 1:08:22.185
There you are, old friend.

1:08:22.603 --> 1:08:24.979
That was quite an entrance back there.

1:08:30.777 --> 1:08:32.029
Listen...

1:08:32.446 --> 1:08:33.447
are we good?

1:08:33.779 --> 1:08:34.781
Yeah?

1:08:34.948 --> 1:08:37.326
I mean, I know it's a little weird
having my ex-weapon around...

1:08:38.076 --> 1:08:39.995
but come on, Mjolnir, in the past.

1:08:40.328 --> 1:08:41.496
It's you and me now, buddy.

1:08:41.830 --> 1:08:43.332
You know what?

1:08:43.497 --> 1:08:45.834
I think it's time for your first beer.
What do you say?

1:08:51.631 --> 1:08:53.050
Delicious.

1:08:53.716 --> 1:08:55.385
I'm sorry we've been fighting lately.

1:09:03.435 --> 1:09:04.435
Hey.

1:09:04.853 --> 1:09:05.854
Oh, hey.

1:09:08.607 --> 1:09:10.399
It's quite the view, huh?

1:09:11.026 --> 1:09:12.027
Yeah. Beautiful.

1:09:12.194 --> 1:09:15.863
I just want to say that was very, very
impressive what you did back there.

1:09:16.573 --> 1:09:18.408
You and Mjolnir, you know.

1:09:21.036 --> 1:09:22.037
Yeah.

1:09:24.665 --> 1:09:26.457
-Space dolphins.
-What?

1:09:27.376 --> 1:09:28.836
You should see some space dolphins...

1:09:29.002 --> 1:09:29.962
What?

1:09:30.587 --> 1:09:32.089
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1:09:32.256 --> 1:09:33.799
Beautiful.

1:09:34.675 --> 1:09:36.134
So beautiful. So rare.

1:09:36.301 --> 1:09:37.344
Very loyal creatures.

1:09:37.511 --> 1:09:40.264
They mate for life, in packs of six.

1:09:40.430 --> 1:09:42.182
Just love.

1:09:42.349 --> 1:09:45.227
With a hey ninny-nonny
and a fair finny-fonny

1:09:45.394 --> 1:09:48.729
Ooh, brother man, you look so hot

1:09:48.897 --> 1:09:51.733
I wanna get in your rocks

1:09:52.442 --> 1:09:55.279
When we get together
We're gonna get it on

1:09:55.445 --> 1:09:59.199
And we're all gonna make some babies

1:09:59.992 --> 1:10:03.871
That is the song that my dad sang
to my other dad when they were courting.

1:10:04.037 --> 1:10:06.957
When two Kronans wanna make a baby,
they get together inside a mountain...

1:10:07.124 --> 1:10:10.586
and they go down to a little lava pool,
and they hold hands over the hot lava...

1:10:10.752 --> 1:10:13.005
and then, after a month,
they pull their hands apart...

1:10:13.172 --> 1:10:16.175
and they find they've created
a beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

1:10:16.675 --> 1:10:18.510
Fascinating. And hot.

1:10:18.802 --> 1:10:20.012
Did you ever have a special someone?

1:10:20.179 --> 1:10:22.973
I've had so many special someones.

1:10:23.140 --> 1:10:25.434
But I don't know...

1:10:26.518 --> 1:10:27.644
I don't know if I want that again.

1:10:27.811 --> 1:10:30.439
Is that because you lost your girlfriend
in battle and never forgave yourself?

1:10:30.606 --> 1:10:33.192
And now, you're just trying to find answers
in the bottom of a bottle...

1:10:33.358 --> 1:10:36.195
or some meaningless dalliance,
which only serves to numb the pain...

1:10:36.361 --> 1:10:38.989
instead of bringing you real happiness
or satisfaction?

1:10:39.156 --> 1:10:41.491
Yeah. Something like that.

1:10:44.286 --> 1:10:47.164
Beautiful. Beautiful things.

1:10:51.460 --> 1:10:52.461
Jane.

1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:53.921
Thor.

1:10:54.087 --> 1:10:55.339
I wanna feel shitty about you.

1:10:55.506 --> 1:10:56.507
What?

1:11:00.594 --> 1:11:04.223
I wanna feel shitty about something
and I think that's you.

1:11:04.389 --> 1:11:05.432
Not really getting any better.

1:11:05.641 --> 1:11:07.100
It's not, is it? Damn it.

1:11:08.727 --> 1:11:11.396
My friend, he told me
that it's better to feel shitty...

1:11:12.648 --> 1:11:14.566
from losing love
than it is to never experience love...

1:11:14.733 --> 1:11:16.151
and to feel nothing at all,
to feel empty...

1:11:16.318 --> 1:11:17.361
and I think he was right...

1:11:18.278 --> 1:11:20.697
which is how I've been feeling
for a long time.

1:11:20.864 --> 1:11:23.158
I've pushed people away,
kept them at a distance...

1:11:23.325 --> 1:11:24.618
because of the fear of that loss...

1:11:24.785 --> 1:11:26.787
but I don't wanna do that anymore.
I don't wanna live like that.

1:11:26.995 --> 1:11:28.580
Better to close off your heart
than feel the pain.

1:11:28.789 --> 1:11:31.041
That's what I did, yes.
I closed off my heart...

1:11:31.208 --> 1:11:32.918
and I meditated.
Did you meditate?

1:11:33.085 --> 1:11:34.253
No. It's so boring.

1:11:34.419 --> 1:11:36.088
It actually made me more angry.

1:11:37.047 --> 1:11:39.591
But I'm tired of giving myself over
to the idea of fate...

1:11:39.758 --> 1:11:42.052
and trying to figure out
what the universe wants from me.

1:11:42.219 --> 1:11:44.680
I wanna live in the moment,
I wanna live like there's no tomorrow...

1:11:44.847 --> 1:11:45.931
throw caution to the wind.

1:11:46.098 --> 1:11:48.058
I wanna be with you, Jane.

1:11:49.017 --> 1:11:50.185
What do you say?

1:11:50.686 --> 1:11:52.354
I have cancer.

1:11:54.773 --> 1:11:55.774
I'm sorry. What?

1:11:56.400 --> 1:11:57.401
I'm sick.

1:11:57.568 --> 1:11:59.194
-Wait. What's happening?
-Bye.

1:11:59.945 --> 1:12:02.239
No, no, no. Jane, Jane, Jane.
Wait, wait, wait. Jane.

1:12:02.447 --> 1:12:04.950
What did I say? I didn't mean that.
Just kidding.

1:12:06.577 --> 1:12:08.120
I don't have cancer.

1:12:08.287 --> 1:12:09.705
Let's go smash something.

1:12:10.497 --> 1:12:11.498
Jane, I'm so sorry.

1:12:11.665 --> 1:12:13.625
Don't be sorry for me.

1:12:15.210 --> 1:12:16.712
When did you find out?

1:12:18.922 --> 1:12:20.716
Like six months ago.

1:12:20.883 --> 1:12:24.678
I was just feeling tired,
and then they told me I have Stage Four.

1:12:24.845 --> 1:12:26.555
Get my affairs in order.

1:12:27.389 --> 1:12:29.725
And then I heard Mjolnir calling me...

1:12:30.517 --> 1:12:32.978
so I thought maybe,
if science isn't working...

1:12:33.896 --> 1:12:36.356
maybe Viking space magic.

1:12:37.357 --> 1:12:38.859
That's why you came to New Asgard.

1:12:39.026 --> 1:12:41.862
Yeah, I thought the hammer
maybe could cure me...

1:12:42.029 --> 1:12:44.948
and I think it's getting better.

1:12:45.616 --> 1:12:47.075
Maybe not.

1:12:48.118 --> 1:12:50.329
Jane, none of us know how long we have.

1:12:50.495 --> 1:12:52.748
We don't know what tomorrow holds.

1:12:52.915 --> 1:12:53.916
And Mjolnir...

1:12:54.291 --> 1:12:55.542
Mjolnir chose you.

1:12:56.418 --> 1:12:58.337
And it chose you because you're worthy.

1:12:58.504 --> 1:12:59.755
And that's something.

1:12:59.922 --> 1:13:01.048
When I first met you...

1:13:01.715 --> 1:13:04.343
I was unworthy.
I was unable to pick up that hammer.

1:13:05.219 --> 1:13:06.386
But you taught me...

1:13:06.553 --> 1:13:09.515
there is no greater purpose
than to help those in need.

1:13:10.265 --> 1:13:12.351
You made me worthy.

1:13:13.810 --> 1:13:15.979
So whatever you wanna do,
we can do together.

1:13:18.148 --> 1:13:19.149
Okay.

1:13:19.316 --> 1:13:21.068
Now what do you wanna do?

1:13:22.194 --> 1:13:24.863
I wanna get those children
back to their families.

1:13:25.030 --> 1:13:26.281
I wanna finish that mission.

1:13:27.491 --> 1:13:28.909
Spoken like a true Thor.

1:13:30.702 --> 1:13:32.037
How do you feel now?

1:13:33.247 --> 1:13:34.373
So scared.

1:13:35.666 --> 1:13:36.667
How are you feeling?

1:13:36.834 --> 1:13:38.043
Shitty.

1:13:38.210 --> 1:13:39.086
How shitty?

1:13:39.253 --> 1:13:40.879
-Really shitty.
-Well, then...

1:13:52.015 --> 1:13:54.017
I wonder what those two are talking about
out there.

1:13:54.685 --> 1:13:55.936
Yeah, they're not talking.

1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:02.985
Do you think those two will ever hold hands
over a hot lava pool and make a Thor baby?

1:14:04.778 --> 1:14:06.947
It's unlikely, sadly.

1:14:07.531 --> 1:14:10.242
That's too bad.
I think Thor would make a great dad.

1:14:13.453 --> 1:14:14.872
Hey. We're here.

1:14:23.839 --> 1:14:25.424
Where did all the color go?

1:14:58.874 --> 1:15:00.125
They're not here.

1:15:05.631 --> 1:15:06.673
Where are they?

1:15:25.901 --> 1:15:27.653
What the hell is this place?

1:15:56.014 --> 1:15:58.016
Bifrost is the key?

1:16:07.401 --> 1:16:08.652
It's a trap!

1:16:26.086 --> 1:16:28.505
You wanna tell me why you just threw
Stormbreaker out the window?

1:16:28.672 --> 1:16:30.799
He needs it to open the Gates of Eternity.

1:17:02.122 --> 1:17:03.582
We really have to stop meeting like this.

1:17:03.749 --> 1:17:04.791
Call the axe.

1:17:04.958 --> 1:17:06.460
I'll call the axe when you call the dentist.

1:17:06.627 --> 1:17:09.254
Call the axe.

1:17:09.421 --> 1:17:11.507
Tell me where the children are
or I'm gonna kill you.

1:17:18.597 --> 1:17:20.015
Call the axe.

1:17:27.231 --> 1:17:29.066
Some god you are.

1:17:29.942 --> 1:17:33.320
You know nothing of being a god.

1:17:35.864 --> 1:17:40.369
You went to the gods for help,
and they did nothing.

1:17:40.536 --> 1:17:43.205
We're alike in that sense.

1:17:43.789 --> 1:17:45.082
He's nothing like you.

1:17:45.249 --> 1:17:46.750
What was that?

1:17:49.920 --> 1:17:51.713
I said he's nothing like you.

1:17:51.880 --> 1:17:53.257
That's right.

1:17:53.423 --> 1:17:57.803
I'm not a hypocrite.
I'm truly creating peace.

1:17:57.970 --> 1:17:59.721
Peace? You're murdering innocent gods.

1:17:59.888 --> 1:18:00.931
Innocent?

1:18:02.099 --> 1:18:03.100
Are you a Valkyrie?

1:18:03.267 --> 1:18:04.184
Yes.

1:18:05.435 --> 1:18:06.937
How exciting!

1:18:08.021 --> 1:18:11.024
Oh, the gods failed you, too...

1:18:11.358 --> 1:18:15.070
when your sisterhood was led to slaughter.

1:18:15.237 --> 1:18:16.321
Don't you dare speak...

1:18:17.114 --> 1:18:19.157
Did you pray to the gods...

1:18:19.324 --> 1:18:23.579
when the women you loved
laid dying on the battlefield?

1:18:25.455 --> 1:18:27.583
Did you beg them for help...

1:18:28.250 --> 1:18:30.294
as your family was massacred?

1:18:33.255 --> 1:18:34.256
Good chat.

1:18:38.010 --> 1:18:39.178
This one.

1:18:39.678 --> 1:18:41.430
You're interesting.

1:18:42.556 --> 1:18:44.099
You're different.

1:18:44.808 --> 1:18:46.018
Yes.

1:18:54.359 --> 1:18:55.611
You're dying.

1:18:57.446 --> 1:18:58.655
I'm sorry.

1:18:59.781 --> 1:19:01.658
We're on the same path.

1:19:03.952 --> 1:19:07.289
Just as the sword empowered me...

1:19:07.956 --> 1:19:10.083
the hammer empowered you.

1:19:11.043 --> 1:19:13.754
But it did nothing
to change your fate.

1:19:14.755 --> 1:19:17.883
The gods will use you...

1:19:18.759 --> 1:19:21.470
but they will not help you.

1:19:21.929 --> 1:19:27.059
There is no eternal reward for us.

1:19:33.690 --> 1:19:35.192
She'll be gone soon.

1:19:36.985 --> 1:19:38.695
And you know who won't help her?

1:19:38.862 --> 1:19:40.614
I'll give you one guess.

1:19:51.834 --> 1:19:53.210
I know your pain.

1:19:53.377 --> 1:19:55.379
Love is pain.

1:20:00.008 --> 1:20:02.427
I had a daughter once.

1:20:03.262 --> 1:20:05.222
I put my faith in a higher power...

1:20:05.389 --> 1:20:08.100
hoping it would save her...

1:20:08.267 --> 1:20:09.935
and she...

1:20:11.144 --> 1:20:12.855
died.

1:20:16.900 --> 1:20:18.986
Now I understand.

1:20:19.152 --> 1:20:21.405
My daughter is the lucky one.

1:20:22.030 --> 1:20:27.244
She does not have to grow up
in a world of suffering...

1:20:27.411 --> 1:20:28.912
and pain...

1:20:29.079 --> 1:20:33.333
run by wicked gods.

1:20:35.002 --> 1:20:37.379
Choose love.

1:20:38.505 --> 1:20:41.967
Call the axe.

1:20:50.642 --> 1:20:52.686
Call...

1:20:53.103 --> 1:20:54.479
the axe.

1:21:30.766 --> 1:21:32.017
You okay?

1:21:32.184 --> 1:21:33.268
Yeah.

1:21:36.230 --> 1:21:37.272
I wanna kill this guy.

1:21:37.439 --> 1:21:39.900
So do I, but we have to take him alive.

1:21:40.067 --> 1:21:42.069
He's our only link to finding those children.

1:22:56.018 --> 1:22:57.811
Thank you, Mr. Goat.

1:23:30.594 --> 1:23:31.595
Val!

1:23:42.731 --> 1:23:44.107
We gotta get her out of here!

1:23:53.909 --> 1:23:55.160
Hey. I got you.

1:24:06.296 --> 1:24:08.173
Hey, guys, we're here.
Come on, let's go.

1:24:08.382 --> 1:24:10.259
Stormbreaker, take us home.

1:25:05.898 --> 1:25:08.150
...at a rate that
none of us have seen before.

1:25:08.317 --> 1:25:11.486
Look, there are other more aggressive forms
of treatment we can try...

1:25:11.653 --> 1:25:14.823
but something's affecting her body's ability
to fight the cancer.

1:25:15.741 --> 1:25:17.367
I'm sorry, Thor.

1:25:31.381 --> 1:25:33.008
There you are. Okay.

1:25:33.175 --> 1:25:34.218
What's goin' on out there?

1:25:34.384 --> 1:25:37.262
Some moron made a fridge without a door.
Can you believe it?

1:25:37.429 --> 1:25:40.474
Not to worry. Got it open
and got you all sorts of goodies.

1:25:40.641 --> 1:25:41.642
How's Val?

1:25:41.975 --> 1:25:44.311
She's in a lot of pain,
but she is stable.

1:25:44.478 --> 1:25:45.354
Okay, good.

1:25:45.854 --> 1:25:48.232
Now you just gotta get this out of my...

1:25:48.398 --> 1:25:49.858
No, no, no.
That's gotta stay in there.

1:25:50.025 --> 1:25:53.278
That's all the magic potions
and elixirs doing their thing, so...

1:25:53.862 --> 1:25:56.615
I'm just gonna pop out for a moment,
pick up the kids, kill the bad guy...

1:25:56.782 --> 1:25:57.950
and then I'll come straight back.

1:25:59.117 --> 1:26:00.702
You're going without me?

1:26:01.453 --> 1:26:02.454
Yeah.

1:26:02.621 --> 1:26:04.581
What happened to, like,
doing everything together?

1:26:04.748 --> 1:26:06.667
He's gonna use those kids to distract you.

1:26:06.834 --> 1:26:07.918
You need me.

1:26:08.085 --> 1:26:10.295
I do need you, Jane. I need you alive.

1:26:10.462 --> 1:26:13.465
It'd be great to have you on the battlefield,
fighting Gorr side by side...

1:26:13.632 --> 1:26:15.425
but that hammer is killing you.

1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:19.763
Every time you use it,
it's draining all of your mortal strength...

1:26:19.930 --> 1:26:22.099
leaving your body unable to fight the cancer.

1:26:22.891 --> 1:26:24.810
What happened to,
"Live like there's no tomorrow"?

1:26:24.977 --> 1:26:26.854
Well, that's before I knew
you might not have one.

1:26:27.020 --> 1:26:28.397
Why not have one more adventure?

1:26:28.605 --> 1:26:30.732
Jane, if there's a chance to live,
you have to take it.

1:26:30.899 --> 1:26:33.735
Spoken like a true Thor
who does not have cancer.

1:26:37.239 --> 1:26:41.201
I know I seem like some cool astrophysicist
from New Mexico...

1:26:41.368 --> 1:26:43.954
just living the dream,
but look at me.

1:26:44.121 --> 1:26:47.791
I wanna keep fighting.
I'm the Mighty Thor.

1:26:47.958 --> 1:26:49.168
And you want me not to do that?

1:26:49.334 --> 1:26:51.920
What's the point of more time of this?

1:26:52.963 --> 1:26:54.506
Because I love you.

1:26:57.050 --> 1:26:58.760
I've always loved you.

1:26:59.845 --> 1:27:01.889
And this is a chance for us.

1:27:02.598 --> 1:27:06.143
But if you pick up that damn hammer again,
then that chance is gone.

1:27:18.197 --> 1:27:19.615
It's your choice, Jane.

1:27:20.782 --> 1:27:23.535
But I'd regret it every single day
if I didn't ask you to stay here...

1:27:23.702 --> 1:27:25.579
so we could try and figure this out together.

1:27:28.790 --> 1:27:30.751
You better come back to me.

1:27:31.627 --> 1:27:33.587
I'm coming back as soon as I can.

1:27:36.131 --> 1:27:38.592
-Break a leg.
-I'll break all his legs.

1:27:52.147 --> 1:27:54.274
Remember that the Gate to Eternity
is at the literal center...

1:27:54.441 --> 1:27:55.484
-of the universe.
-Universe. Yes.

1:27:55.651 --> 1:27:56.902
If you go past the cluster of comets...

1:27:57.069 --> 1:27:59.279
Yes, yes, I know. We've been over this.
I'm not gonna get lost.

1:27:59.821 --> 1:28:02.241
So how you feeling with the old stab wound?

1:28:02.407 --> 1:28:03.575
I think I lost my kidney.

1:28:03.742 --> 1:28:04.993
Gone completely?

1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:06.245
I wish I could join you...

1:28:06.453 --> 1:28:08.914
but I'd probably die,
and that won't help get the kids back...

1:28:09.081 --> 1:28:10.499
so you'll have to go alone.

1:28:11.124 --> 1:28:13.669
All you have to do is destroy that sword.

1:28:13.836 --> 1:28:16.463
It's his source of power.
He won't survive long without it.

1:28:18.465 --> 1:28:20.425
Hey. Don't die.

1:28:20.801 --> 1:28:21.969
Yeah, I know.

1:29:15.731 --> 1:29:17.733
Eternity.

1:29:20.027 --> 1:29:21.445
Finally.

1:29:36.210 --> 1:29:37.461
Come on.

1:30:03.320 --> 1:30:04.321
Hey, kids.

1:30:06.865 --> 1:30:08.200
I knew he'd come.

1:30:08.951 --> 1:30:09.952
Go!

1:30:10.118 --> 1:30:11.119
Go, kids!

1:30:20.212 --> 1:30:22.965
Everyone okay? All right, gather round.
Gather round.

1:30:23.423 --> 1:30:26.176
Good to see you in person, buddy.
Good to see you.

1:30:37.062 --> 1:30:38.397
All right, listen up.
Here's the plan.

1:30:38.564 --> 1:30:40.691
We're gonna sneak our way
towards Stormbreaker...

1:30:40.858 --> 1:30:44.778
being very careful not to bump into
any of those big shadow monsters.

1:30:46.321 --> 1:30:47.698
They're behind me, aren't they?

1:30:53.412 --> 1:30:54.955
Does anyone here have battle experience?

1:30:55.122 --> 1:30:56.081
Battle experience?

1:30:56.248 --> 1:30:58.208
Well, no time to learn
like the present.

1:30:58.375 --> 1:31:00.794
We're not strong like you. We're just kids.

1:31:00.961 --> 1:31:02.921
Hey, don't forget you're Asgardian kids.

1:31:03.380 --> 1:31:05.090
I'm not. I'm just a Lycan kid.

1:31:05.257 --> 1:31:06.383
And I'm a Midassian kid.

1:31:06.550 --> 1:31:07.676
-I'm Falligarian.
-Okay, okay.

1:31:07.843 --> 1:31:10.304
But today you're Asgardians.

1:31:10.470 --> 1:31:11.722
Now collect your weapons.

1:31:11.889 --> 1:31:12.764
What?

1:31:12.931 --> 1:31:14.933
Go and find anything you can pick up.

1:31:15.100 --> 1:31:16.101
Bring it back here.

1:31:16.518 --> 1:31:17.895
Hurry, hurry!

1:31:18.437 --> 1:31:19.563
Okay, cool. Come on!

1:31:20.814 --> 1:31:22.441
They're getting closer.
Hurry up!

1:31:22.608 --> 1:31:23.609
Come on!

1:31:25.235 --> 1:31:28.822
Today is a day that will go down in history.

1:31:29.781 --> 1:31:32.993
Today is the day they will talk about
for generations to come.

1:31:33.160 --> 1:31:35.537
Today we are Space Vikings!

1:31:36.413 --> 1:31:38.248
Present arms!

1:31:43.587 --> 1:31:46.298
Whosoever holds these weapons,
and believes in getting home...

1:31:46.465 --> 1:31:49.301
if they be true of heart
is therefore worthy...

1:31:49.468 --> 1:31:50.928
and shall possess...

1:31:51.929 --> 1:31:53.472
for limited time only...

1:31:54.056 --> 1:31:57.726
the power of Thor!

1:32:06.985 --> 1:32:08.278
General Axl...

1:32:09.947 --> 1:32:11.740
lead your army to that axe.

1:32:12.449 --> 1:32:13.909
We shall do our worst.

1:32:15.410 --> 1:32:16.703
For Asgard.

1:34:12.986 --> 1:34:14.154
Yeah!

1:34:16.615 --> 1:34:17.616
No.

1:34:31.964 --> 1:34:33.382
Jane.

1:34:50.399 --> 1:34:51.984
We destroy that sword and he's dead.

1:34:52.150 --> 1:34:54.278
The gateway's almost open.
You gotta stop Stormbreaker.

1:34:54.987 --> 1:34:56.321
It's okay. I got him.

1:35:04.371 --> 1:35:05.873
Stormbreaker, stop this!

1:35:06.623 --> 1:35:08.250
Get a hold of yourself.
Look what you're doing!

1:35:08.417 --> 1:35:09.751
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1:35:10.711 --> 1:35:13.130
Come on. Come on, buddy.

1:35:18.260 --> 1:35:21.638
Let go of my friend.

1:35:25.809 --> 1:35:27.311
You've lost, Lady Thor.

1:35:34.776 --> 1:35:35.736
First off...

1:35:36.153 --> 1:35:38.780
the name is Mighty Thor.

1:35:40.365 --> 1:35:41.658
And secondly...

1:35:41.825 --> 1:35:43.827
if you can't say Mighty Thor...

1:35:44.828 --> 1:35:48.457
I'll accept Doctor Jane Foster.

1:35:52.419 --> 1:35:53.629
And thirdly...

1:35:54.338 --> 1:35:57.216
Eat my hammer!

1:36:05.516 --> 1:36:07.851
Stormbreaker!

1:36:12.189 --> 1:36:13.440
I knew you could do it.

1:36:14.566 --> 1:36:16.527
Axl! Get them home!

1:38:05.552 --> 1:38:06.678
Jane?

1:38:07.179 --> 1:38:08.180
I'm okay.

1:38:08.555 --> 1:38:09.848
You have to stop him.

1:38:40.128 --> 1:38:41.505
Gorr! Stop!

1:38:46.176 --> 1:38:48.303
What kind of father would I be...

1:38:48.887 --> 1:38:50.472
if I stopped?

1:38:54.393 --> 1:38:57.604
I know your pain,
but this isn't the way.

1:38:59.565 --> 1:39:02.484
It's not death or revenge that you seek.

1:39:05.237 --> 1:39:07.573
What do I seek?

1:39:21.044 --> 1:39:22.296
You seek love.

1:39:25.674 --> 1:39:26.967
Love?

1:39:28.010 --> 1:39:30.012
Why should I seek love?

1:39:30.721 --> 1:39:32.556
Because it's all any of us want.

1:39:35.017 --> 1:39:36.185
How...

1:39:36.351 --> 1:39:40.063
dare you turn your back on me?

1:39:41.607 --> 1:39:43.400
You've won, Gorr.

1:39:43.567 --> 1:39:45.402
Why would I spend
my last moments with you...

1:39:45.569 --> 1:39:46.945
when I can be with her?

1:39:48.322 --> 1:39:49.823
I choose love.

1:39:50.032 --> 1:39:52.868
You can, too. You can bring her back.

1:39:56.788 --> 1:39:58.498
Make your wish.

1:40:29.696 --> 1:40:31.073
I'm dying.

1:40:32.533 --> 1:40:34.159
She would have no one.

1:40:35.410 --> 1:40:37.204
She would be alone.

1:40:44.503 --> 1:40:46.505
She won't be alone.

1:41:56.950 --> 1:41:58.118
My love.

1:42:08.170 --> 1:42:10.088
I've missed you so much.

1:42:12.966 --> 1:42:14.593
I missed you too.

1:42:18.138 --> 1:42:19.389
I'm so sorry.

1:42:19.556 --> 1:42:20.557
It's okay.

1:42:22.643 --> 1:42:25.062
Ever since I picked up that hammer...

1:42:26.897 --> 1:42:28.232
it's like...

1:42:28.982 --> 1:42:30.442
I've gotten an extra life.

1:42:31.902 --> 1:42:33.820
And it was...

1:42:35.531 --> 1:42:37.032
magical.

1:42:39.910 --> 1:42:41.954
Not too bad for a human.

1:42:43.622 --> 1:42:45.165
Not too bad for a god.

1:42:46.124 --> 1:42:50.045
Hey. I think I figured out my catchphrase.

1:42:50.462 --> 1:42:52.047
-Oh, yeah? What is it?
-Come close...

1:42:58.011 --> 1:42:59.179
It's perfect.

1:42:59.346 --> 1:43:00.639
It's the best one yet.

1:43:00.806 --> 1:43:02.015
Thanks.

1:43:10.107 --> 1:43:12.359
Keep your heart open.

1:43:17.865 --> 1:43:19.283
I love you.

1:43:20.534 --> 1:43:22.035
I love you, too.

1:44:07.706 --> 1:44:09.208
Protect her.

1:44:10.751 --> 1:44:12.085
Protect my love.

1:44:46.078 --> 1:44:49.915
Let me tell you
the legend of the Space Viking...

1:44:50.707 --> 1:44:55.879
AKA the Mighty Thor,
AKA Dr. Jane Foster.

1:44:58.131 --> 1:45:00.592
Her sacrifice saved the universe...

1:45:00.759 --> 1:45:04.388
and taught us all
what it means to be worthy.

1:45:04.930 --> 1:45:06.849
She helped the children of the gods...

1:45:07.015 --> 1:45:09.309
who laser-beamed
their way back home...

1:45:09.476 --> 1:45:13.397
to their dozy little fishing village
turned tourist destination.

1:45:14.481 --> 1:45:15.566
Axl!

1:45:15.732 --> 1:45:17.192
I missed you.

1:45:17.568 --> 1:45:18.819
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I'm okay.

1:45:18.986 --> 1:45:20.112
-Are you sure?
-I'm okay.

1:45:20.279 --> 1:45:21.697
The kids were safe to be kids again.

1:45:21.864 --> 1:45:23.240
Louder, three!

1:45:24.867 --> 1:45:25.868
Widen your stance.

1:45:26.034 --> 1:45:29.454
Especially after their king made them
all go to self-defense classes.

1:45:29.621 --> 1:45:31.415
Look at all those budding Space Vikings.

1:45:31.582 --> 1:45:32.708
And the most important part.

1:45:33.208 --> 1:45:34.543
The war cry!

1:45:36.003 --> 1:45:37.254
Even Heimdall's son...

1:45:37.421 --> 1:45:39.089
Axl Heimdallson...

1:45:39.256 --> 1:45:41.466
who could now do
his dad's freaky eye magic...

1:45:41.633 --> 1:45:43.468
was becoming quite the warrior.

1:45:43.927 --> 1:45:46.138
The future of Asgard was secure.

1:45:47.890 --> 1:45:50.851
Speaking of futures,
I was forging one of my own...

1:45:51.018 --> 1:45:52.477
now that my body's grown back...

1:45:53.395 --> 1:45:55.564
with a dude I met called Dwayne.

1:45:57.191 --> 1:45:58.817
And what about Thor, you ask?

1:45:59.401 --> 1:46:01.528
He embarked on a new journey...

1:46:01.695 --> 1:46:06.074
because he had found something to live for,
something to love for.

1:46:06.241 --> 1:46:10.746
A little someone who turned him
from Sad God into Dad God.

1:46:10.913 --> 1:46:12.080
Breakfast is served.

1:46:13.582 --> 1:46:15.542
Hello. There you go.

1:46:15.709 --> 1:46:17.669
Hey. Breakfast.

1:46:18.086 --> 1:46:20.589
Excuse me.
What is that?

1:46:20.756 --> 1:46:22.591
They're pan-flaps. From Earth.

1:46:22.758 --> 1:46:24.593
I don't think I like pan-flaps.

1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:25.844
-You love them.
-No, I don't.

1:46:26.011 --> 1:46:27.846
-Yes, you do.
-I've never had that in my life.

1:46:28.013 --> 1:46:29.556
Come on. Eat up. We have to go.
We're gonna be late.

1:46:29.723 --> 1:46:30.641
Now where are your boots?

1:46:30.891 --> 1:46:32.851
I'm wearing them.

1:46:33.185 --> 1:46:34.353
You're not wearing those.

1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:36.104
-Yes, I am.
-No, you're not.

1:46:36.271 --> 1:46:37.439
Yes, I am.

1:46:37.606 --> 1:46:38.649
No. You're not.

1:46:38.815 --> 1:46:39.983
Go to hell, demon!

1:46:41.902 --> 1:46:42.819
Wow!

1:46:43.237 --> 1:46:45.906
Brand new, now destroyed.
Thank you very much.

1:46:46.073 --> 1:46:47.908
You know what? You wear what you want.

1:46:48.075 --> 1:46:49.910
Don't come complaining to me
when your feet get sore, all right?

1:46:50.077 --> 1:46:51.828
You'll get no sympathy here from me.

1:46:52.037 --> 1:46:54.248
Fine, I'll wear the boots.

1:46:54.414 --> 1:46:55.290
Thank you.

1:46:55.457 --> 1:46:57.209
Remember what my mother used to tell me.

1:46:57.376 --> 1:46:58.377
Listen to the grown-ups...

1:46:58.544 --> 1:47:00.587
and if you see anyone scared
or being picked on...

1:47:00.754 --> 1:47:02.089
-you look after them, okay?
-Okay.

1:47:02.256 --> 1:47:03.632
And most of all, have fun.

1:47:03.799 --> 1:47:05.342
-Gotcha.

1:47:05.509 --> 1:47:07.511
Now where is Mjolnir?
Where did I put him?

1:47:07.678 --> 1:47:08.846
Over there. Sleeping in the bed.

1:47:09.012 --> 1:47:10.180
In the bed.

1:47:11.765 --> 1:47:12.766
Oh, wow.

1:47:15.227 --> 1:47:17.020
That is not coming off.

1:47:17.771 --> 1:47:19.189
What did you do?

1:47:19.356 --> 1:47:21.275
She looked boring before.

1:47:22.359 --> 1:47:23.861
Yeah. Suppose it did.

1:47:24.027 --> 1:47:25.028
I love it.

1:47:25.362 --> 1:47:26.572
Very creative.

1:47:30.742 --> 1:47:31.702
Okay.

1:47:32.369 --> 1:47:33.579
Now, you see the aliens down there?

1:47:33.745 --> 1:47:35.956
-The stripy ones?
-They look nice.

1:47:36.123 --> 1:47:37.916
Yeah, they are nice.
That's why we have to look after them.

1:47:38.083 --> 1:47:39.918
Got it. Protect the nice ones.

1:47:41.044 --> 1:47:42.045
I love you, sweetie.

1:47:42.212 --> 1:47:43.463
Love you, Uncle Thor.

1:47:46.466 --> 1:47:47.968
They will always be there for us.

1:47:48.135 --> 1:47:51.305
The Space Viking
and his girl, born from Eternity.

1:47:51.471 --> 1:47:53.807
With the powers of a god.

1:47:56.268 --> 1:47:57.895
Two warriors...

1:47:58.061 --> 1:48:01.190
fighting the good fight
for those who can't fight good.

1:48:06.862 --> 1:48:10.490
They have traveled far,
and have been given many names.

1:48:11.158 --> 1:48:13.577
But to those who know them best...

1:48:13.744 --> 1:48:15.412
they are simply known...

1:48:15.579 --> 1:48:17.581
as Love and Thunder.

1:50:05.439 --> 1:50:09.443
It used to be that being a god,
it meant something.

1:50:11.236 --> 1:50:13.280
People would whisper your name...

1:50:13.864 --> 1:50:17.784
before sharing
their deepest hopes and dreams.

1:50:18.869 --> 1:50:21.205
They begged you for mercy...

1:50:21.872 --> 1:50:24.625
without ever knowing if you were
actually listening.

1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:27.961
Now...

1:50:28.670 --> 1:50:30.589
you know, they look to the sky...

1:50:31.381 --> 1:50:33.634
they don't ask us for lightning.

1:50:34.301 --> 1:50:36.637
They don't ask us for rain.

1:50:37.346 --> 1:50:41.683
They just want to see
one of their so-called superheroes.

1:50:44.978 --> 1:50:47.356
When did we become the joke?

1:50:50.442 --> 1:50:51.693
No.

1:50:52.653 --> 1:50:54.112
No more.

1:50:55.656 --> 1:50:58.242
They will fear us again...

1:50:58.742 --> 1:51:01.703
when Thor Odinson falls from the sky.

1:51:04.957 --> 1:51:07.835
Do you understand me, Hercules?

1:51:08.335 --> 1:51:10.754
Do you understand me, my son?

1:51:11.046 --> 1:51:12.464
Yes, Father.

1:57:59.955 --> 1:58:00.873
What?

1:58:02.541 --> 1:58:03.667
Hey.

1:58:05.043 --> 1:58:06.545
Jane Foster.

1:58:07.421 --> 1:58:08.964
Heimdall.

1:58:09.423 --> 1:58:10.799
I see you're dead now.

1:58:11.550 --> 1:58:12.801
Yeah.

1:58:13.427 --> 1:58:15.429
Thank you for looking after my son.

1:58:16.180 --> 1:58:18.807
You are very welcome here,
to the land of the gods.

1:58:23.562 --> 1:58:25.314
Welcome to Valhalla.
