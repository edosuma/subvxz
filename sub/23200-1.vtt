00:12.804 --> 00:14.723
He's looking! He's smiling!

00:14.806 --> 00:16.350
He smiled at me!

00:16.433 --> 00:19.519
Lane, we love you!
The whole world loves you!

00:28.487 --> 00:31.156
He saw me. He smiled at me.
Do you see that?

00:31.239 --> 00:32.281
He noticed me!

00:32.365 --> 00:35.202
Lane, you're the best. The absolute best.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.246
We love you! I love you!

00:40.832 --> 00:42.959
Come on, Harry, don't give me that.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.004
How many times you sell out
the arena in 24 hours?

00:46.588 --> 00:49.799
That's because you never promoted
a Lane Kincaid concert before.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.635
Bill, think we could play little tennis?

00:52.719 --> 00:54.179
You know better than that, Lane.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.181
Yeah.

00:56.348 --> 01:00.143
I've been on the road so long I've probably
forgotten how to keep score anyway.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.771
We talked percentages five weeks ago.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.859
You didn't think the kid was big enough
then. That's your own tough luck.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.528
Misrepresentation?

01:11.488 --> 01:14.741
Harry, is it my fault that
you don't read the trades!

01:15.116 --> 01:18.203
But you should have asked somebody
who's a little bit more with it!

01:59.827 --> 02:03.164
Let me help you with that. It's no problem.
I was going in there anyway.

02:36.947 --> 02:39.950
Easy with that!
He's not a piece of furniture, you know.

02:41.201 --> 02:43.329
That kid in there is worth $2 million bucks.

04:16.462 --> 04:18.047
We expecting somebody?

04:18.380 --> 04:19.507
All right, hold it!

04:20.675 --> 04:22.176
Lane, lock your door!

04:29.309 --> 04:31.894
- What are you doing?
- Time to go for a little ride.

04:33.396 --> 04:34.480
Where are you taking me?

04:34.564 --> 04:37.066
To your just reward. Let's go.

06:08.157 --> 06:11.326
To tell you how grateful I am,
it's impossible.

06:11.410 --> 06:13.829
Well, the IADC is grateful, too,
Mr. Springfield.

06:13.912 --> 06:15.163
Without your cooperation...

06:15.247 --> 06:18.375
we could never have stopped
that attempted sabotage. Thank you.

06:18.584 --> 06:21.545
Would that all dealings between
government and big business...

06:21.628 --> 06:22.838
had such happy endings.

06:22.921 --> 06:26.758
Daddy, you haven't done anything.
And you promised me you would.

06:27.009 --> 06:30.595
The least you could do is drop your name
and make the police do something.

06:30.679 --> 06:32.597
This is my daughter, Whitney.

06:32.681 --> 06:34.558
Whitney, Diana Prince.

06:34.641 --> 06:35.684
Hi, Whitney.

06:35.767 --> 06:37.102
The government agent!

06:37.185 --> 06:38.603
I never told you that.

06:38.687 --> 06:40.313
I pick things up.

06:40.689 --> 06:43.608
Aside from forgetting her manners,
and having very big ears...

06:43.692 --> 06:46.528
Whitney is convinced
some young singing star-

06:46.611 --> 06:48.154
Lane Kincaid.

06:48.238 --> 06:51.700
One of her latest in a series
of desperate heartthrobs.

06:52.659 --> 06:54.869
For some reason, she thinks
he's been abducted.

06:54.953 --> 06:56.997
He has. I saw them do it!

06:57.706 --> 07:00.458
Daddy, they're going to kill him
and it will be your fault.

07:00.542 --> 07:02.585
Whitney, Miss Prince has a plane to catch.

07:02.669 --> 07:06.256
And neither she, nor I, nor anyone else
has time for your nonsense.

07:06.339 --> 07:08.550
Daddy, it's not nonsense.

07:09.634 --> 07:12.721
I wish I could stay, Whitney,
but I do have to pack.

07:13.721 --> 07:15.432
Say goodbye to Miss Prince, Whitney.

07:15.515 --> 07:17.392
- Good-bye, Whitney.
- Good-bye.

07:19.811 --> 07:23.398
I want to tell you again that I'm very
grateful for everything you did.

07:23.481 --> 07:26.651
- If there is anything we can do to help-
- One thing, Mr. Springfield...

07:39.622 --> 07:42.583
- Stop pushing me!
- Who's pushing you? Let's go.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.919
- I am not exactly sleepwalking-
- Yeah.

08:01.227 --> 08:04.188
So this is Mr. Lane Kincaid...

08:04.272 --> 08:08.276
whom millions of young persons
admire and adore.

08:09.735 --> 08:11.320
What a pleasure.

08:14.115 --> 08:16.617
Wish I could say the same, but I can't.

08:16.784 --> 08:20.121
That's quite all right.
After all, you have been kidnapped.

08:20.454 --> 08:22.415
Your life is in my hands.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.417
In other words...

08:24.834 --> 08:28.671
you'd better keep me, alive,
well, and happy.

08:29.213 --> 08:32.633
Because if you don't,
you don't get a cent. Correct?

08:37.513 --> 08:38.847
And right now...

08:39.890 --> 08:43.102
I feel like having a large steak.

08:45.145 --> 08:46.605
Medium-rare will be fine.

08:48.023 --> 08:50.651
Shall we accommodate the young man,
Mr. Morley?

08:51.193 --> 08:52.403
Yes, sir.

08:58.117 --> 08:59.284
Mr. Kincaid.

09:00.994 --> 09:04.832
Don't you ever sit down in my presence...

09:05.582 --> 09:07.334
without being asked.

09:11.171 --> 09:13.590
Sorry. It was an accident.

09:26.061 --> 09:27.354
Hi, Miss Prince.

09:27.688 --> 09:28.730
Hi.

09:28.939 --> 09:31.733
Whitney. Whitney Springfield.
We just met.

09:31.858 --> 09:33.235
Yes, I know.

09:33.527 --> 09:36.321
I found out from my dad's secretary
where you were staying.

09:37.656 --> 09:40.033
- You were looking for me?
- Yes, I was.

09:40.325 --> 09:41.827
May I call you Diana?

09:41.910 --> 09:42.994
Sure.

09:43.078 --> 09:45.288
The Brownfield Towers, on Rodeo Drive.

09:45.372 --> 09:46.623
No, LAX.

09:47.082 --> 09:50.669
I have to get to the airport, Whitney,
not Beverly Hills.

09:51.169 --> 09:54.381
You heard what I said, cabbie.
Remember what I told you before?

09:54.923 --> 09:56.383
Rodeo Drive, it is.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.861
I told him I tip 30%, which I do.

10:17.946 --> 10:19.948
Please, Diana, you've got to help me.

10:20.031 --> 10:22.200
Lane's been kidnapped, he really has!

10:22.283 --> 10:25.245
Now, there is no way somebody
that famous could be kidnapped...

10:25.328 --> 10:26.830
without anybody knowing about it.

10:26.913 --> 10:28.665
I snuck up there to get his autograph...

10:28.748 --> 10:32.085
I saw a man with a mask and a gun
make Lane leave with him!

10:32.585 --> 10:36.089
If he was kidnapped, even the police
couldn't keep it quiet, Whitney.

10:36.172 --> 10:38.299
Maybe they don't know about it.

10:38.383 --> 10:40.718
Please, Diana, find out for sure!

10:40.802 --> 10:43.262
You're a spy. You can find out anything!

10:43.805 --> 10:46.265
Please, I can pay for any trouble
I cause you.

10:46.349 --> 10:47.600
I get a heck of an allowance.

10:47.684 --> 10:49.602
I know. You tip 30%.

10:51.104 --> 10:52.271
How much?

10:52.730 --> 10:55.108
You heard correctly, Mr. Ripley.

10:55.525 --> 10:57.402
$2 million.

10:58.319 --> 10:59.487
I won't pay it.

10:59.695 --> 11:03.574
With a Lane Kincaid concert
worth $1 million coming up?

11:04.659 --> 11:07.578
And five gold records last year alone?

11:08.037 --> 11:10.122
You'll pay, Mr. Ripley.

11:10.289 --> 11:11.457
You'll pay.

11:30.768 --> 11:32.770
He's in the penthouse on the top floor.

11:33.479 --> 11:36.816
He's blond, good-looking.
Kind of longish hair, good-looking.

11:36.899 --> 11:38.609
I know what he looks like, Whitney.

11:38.692 --> 11:41.695
Make them let you see him.
Tell them you're with the government.

11:41.779 --> 11:43.197
No, that might scare them.

11:43.280 --> 11:44.615
Tell them you're a writer.

11:44.907 --> 11:47.868
Why don't you leave that to me
and meet me back at the hotel.

11:47.952 --> 11:49.119
- Okay.
- Right.

11:49.203 --> 11:50.329
- Diana?
- Yes.

11:50.412 --> 11:52.539
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

11:53.332 --> 11:54.416
Be careful.

14:07.799 --> 14:09.550
$2 million!

14:20.311 --> 14:22.730
Yeah, hello. Let me to talk to
the bank manager, please.

14:25.816 --> 14:27.943
Mr. Overton. This is Ash Ripley.

14:52.468 --> 14:55.804
I saw a man with a mask and a gun
make Lane leave With him.

15:01.352 --> 15:02.937
I just saw him, Whitney.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.146
Who?

15:04.229 --> 15:06.982
Lane. He was in his room, as big as life.

15:07.691 --> 15:09.193
As plain as day.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.694
You couldn't have.

15:10.903 --> 15:13.447
I saw them take him away at gunpoint!

15:13.697 --> 15:15.240
Do you think I made it up?

15:15.324 --> 15:18.285
No, I think you saw something.

15:18.368 --> 15:20.204
You probably just misunderstood.

15:20.454 --> 15:22.331
I didn't misunderstand.

15:22.414 --> 15:25.000
I know what a mask is for
and I know what a gun is for!

15:25.083 --> 15:26.126
I'm not a baby!

15:26.210 --> 15:27.377
I didn't mean that, Whitney.

15:27.461 --> 15:29.796
If you don't believe me, just say so!

15:29.880 --> 15:31.215
I'm sorry.

15:31.548 --> 15:33.800
No. Just forget it. I'm sorry.

15:34.051 --> 15:36.053
Just forget about the whole thing.

15:36.553 --> 15:38.472
Look, your bags are right there.

15:38.555 --> 15:41.516
The room is paid for.
Just go on back to Washington.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.899
You know, on the news...

15:49.066 --> 15:52.069
they said that Lane had been
rehearsing all day for his concert.

15:53.070 --> 15:54.988
Why do you think they'd lie like that?

15:56.782 --> 15:58.700
And why would Lane be in his room...

15:58.784 --> 16:00.994
when logically he would be rehearsing?

16:04.164 --> 16:05.373
Okay.

16:05.582 --> 16:10.253
It sounds suspicious enough to me
to do just a little bit more checking.

16:23.933 --> 16:27.395
You guys could've at least let me
and my brother have some time to talk.

16:27.479 --> 16:29.189
It's been 10 years, you know.

16:29.564 --> 16:32.317
But then I guess that doesn't matter
to you creeps, right?

16:32.859 --> 16:33.943
King me.

16:35.987 --> 16:40.450
It wasn't Mr. Crichton's intention
to arrange a family reunion.

16:40.617 --> 16:43.328
He dug up your brother,
so he could switch places with you.

16:43.411 --> 16:44.454
Nobody knows.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.790
Nobody but your manager knows
the real Lane Kincaid's been kidnapped.

16:47.874 --> 16:48.917
You got that?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.210
That's very smart.

16:51.461 --> 16:54.714
I guess, your Mr. "Crockton"
must think he's hot stuff.

16:54.797 --> 16:56.382
That's "Crichton. "

17:00.178 --> 17:01.637
You're darn right, he's hot stuff.

17:01.721 --> 17:05.223
If I told you the people in high places,
and I mean really high places...

17:05.308 --> 17:08.603
he's kidnapped without anybody
catching on, it'd blow your socks off.

17:08.685 --> 17:11.939
Not all of them were obliging
enough to have a bona fide twin...

17:12.022 --> 17:14.275
waiting in the wings like you.

17:16.152 --> 17:18.069
Yeah, well, Morley? You know what?

17:18.154 --> 17:19.196
What?

17:19.280 --> 17:21.699
Right now, I'd love to have a BLT...

17:21.781 --> 17:25.286
on white, with extra mayo, lettuce...

17:25.828 --> 17:27.246
corn chips...

17:32.501 --> 17:33.794
and a root beer.

17:33.961 --> 17:35.796
It would seem the game is over anyway.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.301
Okay, you got it.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.902
Didn't I tell you
to keep the curtains closed?

17:57.985 --> 17:59.028
Sorry.

17:59.111 --> 18:01.280
Now you, you've got an interview
in a half-hour.

18:01.363 --> 18:02.406
You're kidding.

18:02.489 --> 18:05.451
Some creep from the Tribune
didn't buy our rehearsal story.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.704
Now, listen, not one word
about what's happened.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.914
The same guys who brought you here
in that box...

18:10.998 --> 18:14.084
they could just as easily take you out
in a coffin. You got that?

18:14.168 --> 18:17.546
They promised me, if I did as they said,
they wouldn't hurt me or Melvin.

18:17.629 --> 18:21.592
As long as I'm stuck with you,
you better start acting like Lane Kincaid-

18:21.675 --> 18:23.177
Melvin? Who's Melvin.

18:23.510 --> 18:25.804
Lane, sir. His real name is Melvin.
Mine's Michael.

18:25.888 --> 18:28.557
I don't care if your names are
Punch and Judy...

18:28.640 --> 18:30.392
and you were separated at age nine...

18:30.476 --> 18:33.103
when the Alaskan pipeline blew
and washed away your igloo!

18:33.187 --> 18:35.189
At the age of five,
when our foster parents-

18:35.272 --> 18:36.356
I don't care.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.902
From now on, you're Lane Kincaid.
Don't forget that.

18:41.445 --> 18:42.946
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

18:54.499 --> 18:55.751
- Trevor.
- Steve?

18:55.834 --> 18:57.794
Diana, you at the airport?

18:57.878 --> 19:00.422
No, Steve, I'm still in Los Angeles.

19:00.630 --> 19:02.883
I thought that Springfield thing was
all wrapped up.

19:02.966 --> 19:04.050
It is.

19:04.134 --> 19:06.094
Listen, I'll tell you about it later.

19:06.178 --> 19:07.971
Right now, I need some information.

19:08.054 --> 19:11.057
Information? What kind?
Human-type or computer-type?

19:12.017 --> 19:13.977
I think a little of both.

19:14.185 --> 19:16.938
In that case, hang on.
I got a surprise for you.

19:17.022 --> 19:18.148
Surprise?

19:29.284 --> 19:30.368
Steve?

19:31.161 --> 19:32.287
Try again!

19:33.329 --> 19:34.372
Ira?

19:34.456 --> 19:35.498
Affirmative.

19:35.582 --> 19:39.127
The patch cable between Ira and the
phone company was completed yesterday.

19:39.210 --> 19:41.754
You are the first to benefit
from its installation.

19:41.838 --> 19:43.423
Imagine my delight.

19:43.506 --> 19:45.049
What can we do for you?

19:45.133 --> 19:46.259
Okay, fellas.

19:46.342 --> 19:48.887
The subject is kidnapping.

19:49.179 --> 19:53.016
Only the victim isn't missing.
One Lane Kincaid.

19:53.308 --> 19:56.019
He seems to have been replaced
by someone else.

19:56.269 --> 19:57.645
Any ideas?

20:03.693 --> 20:07.613
The name Raleigh Crichton is associated
with a dozen rumored kidnappings...

20:07.697 --> 20:10.241
in which the victim
Was replaced by a double.

20:10.324 --> 20:13.494
Yeah, he and I ha ve crossed paths before.

20:13.578 --> 20:15.079
Crichton supposedly arranges it...

20:15.163 --> 20:18.833
so that only those closest to the victim
know there's even been a kidnapping.

20:18.916 --> 20:20.334
It makes it easier for them...

20:20.418 --> 20:23.838
to pay the ransom without
contacting the police or the FBl.

20:23.921 --> 20:26.174
Rumor has it, he's been very successful.

20:26.257 --> 20:29.510
He certainly found
a perfect double for Lane.

20:29.594 --> 20:32.513
Because the Lane Kincaid concert
is tomorrow night...

20:32.597 --> 20:36.851
it is logical that the ransom will be paid
and the victim returned before then.

20:36.934 --> 20:39.603
His manager will probably make the drop.

20:39.687 --> 20:42.314
I'll keep an eye on him. Thank you, fellas.

20:42.398 --> 20:44.358
Keep in touch, Diana Prince.

20:44.442 --> 20:47.987
Now that I've got your number, Ira,
you bet.

20:48.362 --> 20:49.488
Bye.

22:04.938 --> 22:06.273
Mr. Ripley?

22:07.399 --> 22:09.901
I know that Lane has been kidnapped.

22:10.110 --> 22:11.194
I'm here to help.

22:11.278 --> 22:13.780
Mind your own business, lady.
That's how you can help.

22:14.239 --> 22:15.365
Who are you?

22:15.448 --> 22:18.535
That doesn't really matter.
You can't let them get away with this.

22:18.618 --> 22:21.329
What I can't do is blow a concert
worth $1 million...

22:21.413 --> 22:23.039
and you're not going to make me.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.250
You see this?

22:25.333 --> 22:27.752
From now on,
it's going to be in my pocket...

22:27.836 --> 22:29.754
but it's gonna be aimed right at you.

22:30.171 --> 22:33.299
Now you just move ahead,
towards that shack, okay.

22:33.591 --> 22:34.759
Slowly.

22:34.968 --> 22:36.052
Move it.

22:37.637 --> 22:38.847
Move it!

22:47.313 --> 22:49.482
Go ahead, come on! All right, stop here.

22:49.566 --> 22:51.151
Something doesn't smell right.

22:52.110 --> 22:53.987
Get in. Nice and easy.

22:55.154 --> 22:57.699
- I'm trying to tell you-
- Come on, get in there.

22:57.866 --> 22:59.200
Quiet!

23:03.997 --> 23:05.915
You're making a mistake.

23:06.291 --> 23:07.417
Keep quiet!

23:09.002 --> 23:10.962
He got rid of the girl.

23:11.462 --> 23:12.630
But I don't like it.

23:12.714 --> 23:14.757
And neither Will Crichton. Abort.

23:24.308 --> 23:26.519
Forget it, Mr. Ripley. The deal's off.

23:26.602 --> 23:27.770
No!

23:28.437 --> 23:29.814
No! Wait a minute!

23:29.897 --> 23:32.900
I followed all the instructions
to the letter. It's okay!

24:05.766 --> 24:07.017
Are you okay?

24:07.268 --> 24:08.394
Yeah.

24:18.153 --> 24:19.405
Floor it!

24:24.868 --> 24:26.078
Help!

24:26.912 --> 24:27.996
Over here!

24:43.428 --> 24:46.807
Sorry, Wonder Woman.
You were interfering in my business.

24:47.182 --> 24:51.144
This is no concern of yours
or anybody else's. Don't bother with that.

24:51.228 --> 24:53.397
I mean, because...
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

24:53.480 --> 24:56.858
Those phone calls from the kidnappers,
they were either long distance...

24:56.942 --> 24:59.695
or ship-to-shore, you know.
I don't even know who they were.

24:59.778 --> 25:01.405
And when you take that off...

25:01.488 --> 25:03.949
I'm just gonna deny
there was a kidnapping.

25:04.032 --> 25:05.575
So, there's no point, right?

25:08.286 --> 25:12.874
After all we've done to make it easy
for him to pay the ransom...

25:13.667 --> 25:16.294
that fool involved Wonder Woman?

25:17.003 --> 25:18.755
Boss, we don't know for sure.

25:18.839 --> 25:21.508
Ripley was just as surprised
as we were when she showed.

25:22.884 --> 25:25.804
I suppose it's only fair...

25:25.971 --> 25:28.139
to hear both sides of the story...

25:28.640 --> 25:30.600
before taking final action.

25:33.561 --> 25:36.398
Look, I had nothing to do
with Wonder Woman's being there.

25:36.982 --> 25:39.317
There's been no double-cross, believe me.

25:39.776 --> 25:43.905
As far as she, the police, or anybody else
is concerned, there's been no kidnapping.

25:45.824 --> 25:46.950
Look...

25:48.118 --> 25:50.120
let's arrange another drop. All right?

25:51.037 --> 25:53.540
I'll bring the $2 million
any time, any place.

25:54.749 --> 25:58.002
Let's make it soon.
So Lane can be fresh for that concert.

25:58.086 --> 26:00.421
Lane is not going to be in that concert.

26:00.588 --> 26:02.590
It looks like Michael is.

26:02.924 --> 26:04.092
What?

26:04.175 --> 26:08.012
It's about time you learned a lesson
about carelessness, Mr. Ripley.

26:08.179 --> 26:09.764
I'll be in touch.

26:10.348 --> 26:12.141
After tomorrow night.

26:12.517 --> 26:13.685
Wait.

26:15.979 --> 26:18.189
Without Lane, I'll be ruined.

26:18.564 --> 26:20.692
You're gonna end up with nothing.

26:25.696 --> 26:28.533
If you know he's been kidnapped
and replaced by his twin-

26:28.616 --> 26:30.868
His manager refuses to report it.

26:30.952 --> 26:33.079
If we go and make a fuss about it...

26:33.162 --> 26:35.122
we might be putting Lane
in even more danger.

26:35.206 --> 26:36.332
He's in danger, all right.

26:36.415 --> 26:38.876
I thought the men who took him
were going to kill him.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.044
Why do you say that?

26:40.127 --> 26:42.213
Something the guy in the mask said.

26:42.296 --> 26:44.674
How come they haven't cancelled
tonight's concert?

26:44.757 --> 26:46.550
That's a very good question.

26:47.218 --> 26:49.428
I don't suppose you have an extra ticket?

26:49.512 --> 26:51.722
Yeah, I do. My housekeeper
was going to take me.

26:51.806 --> 26:53.349
But will you go with me?

26:54.767 --> 26:55.976
I would love to.

26:56.060 --> 26:57.144
Great.

26:57.228 --> 26:59.438
Now maybe we'll find out what's going on.

27:00.898 --> 27:02.441
I got to do something.

27:03.651 --> 27:05.569
I got it. Lip-synch.

27:05.903 --> 27:07.655
He can lip-synch the songs.

27:07.738 --> 27:08.906
You know what lip-synch is?

27:08.989 --> 27:10.407
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

27:10.491 --> 27:11.534
Great.

27:11.617 --> 27:13.327
All right. Now you just fake it.

27:13.410 --> 27:15.079
You move your lips to the records.

27:15.162 --> 27:18.415
Do you know all of Lane's songs?
Every red-blooded American kid does.

27:18.499 --> 27:21.418
No, sir. My foster parents
never let me listen to the radio.

27:21.502 --> 27:22.628
Your foster parents.

27:22.711 --> 27:25.798
Your loving foster parents
haven't even reported you missing yet.

27:25.881 --> 27:27.383
Ripley, cool it.

27:27.466 --> 27:30.260
I'm the only person here
who cares about you.

27:30.344 --> 27:33.347
I'm the only one who can help you now.
The only one!

27:33.889 --> 27:36.433
I want you to get on that stage tonight.

27:36.517 --> 27:39.353
I want to you perform.
I want you to be Lane Kincaid.

27:52.115 --> 27:53.450
I'm sorry.

27:54.159 --> 27:55.494
Come here.

27:58.956 --> 28:00.916
Can't you do something?

28:02.334 --> 28:04.586
I can play a little guitar,
a little bit of singing.

28:04.670 --> 28:05.837
Yeah?

28:05.921 --> 28:07.923
Get a guitar. Terrific.

28:08.006 --> 28:11.510
All right, look,
I'm gonna get you some records.

28:11.593 --> 28:13.637
You're gonna memorize
the songs I tell you...

28:13.720 --> 28:16.515
and practice your little heart out
on the guitar, right?

28:16.973 --> 28:18.642
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

28:46.336 --> 28:48.338
Hot dogs here!

29:18.868 --> 29:20.370
All right, now. You feel all right?

29:20.453 --> 29:23.456
Don't be nervous when you get out there.
Just remember everything.

29:23.539 --> 29:24.624
Lip-synch, okay?

29:24.707 --> 29:26.501
All right. Wait a second. Hold on.

29:28.044 --> 29:30.546
All right, you look great. Go ahead!

29:33.549 --> 29:35.551
I think I'm gonna be sick.

29:44.018 --> 29:45.645
He looks just like him.

29:45.895 --> 29:49.190
Do you suppose we're wrong?
Do you suppose that's Lane, after all?

29:49.607 --> 29:51.734
We'll know as soon as he starts to sing.

30:10.836 --> 30:12.129
He's faking it.

30:12.505 --> 30:15.591
I guess we know now
why they didn't cancel the concert.

30:15.758 --> 30:19.386
These kids don't blow a month's allowance
just to see someone move his lips.

30:19.512 --> 30:21.680
Even if he does look just like Lane.

30:37.112 --> 30:38.155
You pulling out?

30:38.238 --> 30:39.281
You better believe it.

30:39.365 --> 30:41.909
Me and the advance money
are moving to higher ground.

30:41.992 --> 30:43.368
Give him a chance. Hear him out.

30:43.452 --> 30:47.790
The only voice I want to hear is an
airline pilot welcoming me in to Chicago.

30:47.873 --> 30:49.958
I'll wire the money I owe you
when I get there.

30:50.042 --> 30:52.377
You ought to at least
hear him long enough.

30:52.461 --> 30:54.296
Don't use up all your strength, you know.

30:54.379 --> 30:58.091
You're gonna need it for your new buddy
when the people out there kill him.

31:06.308 --> 31:09.645
This audience isn't going to put up with
canned music any longer.

31:10.103 --> 31:12.356
If I was him, I'd start running now.

31:14.149 --> 31:15.984
Get off the stage!

31:16.360 --> 31:17.402
Cut the tape, please.

31:17.486 --> 31:18.528
Are you lip-synching?

31:27.829 --> 31:29.331
No more tapes.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.793
I guess it's time for real music.

31:35.253 --> 31:36.838
This is my kind of stuff.

32:22.383 --> 32:25.011
His music is different, but it's good.

32:25.094 --> 32:26.471
It's really good!

32:26.888 --> 32:29.557
Which could be bad for Lane.

32:30.933 --> 32:32.268
Really bad.

32:48.951 --> 32:50.036
He's as good as Lane.

32:50.119 --> 32:51.829
I tried to tell you.

32:52.914 --> 32:54.707
He's as good as Lane!

32:54.790 --> 32:55.917
He's what?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.168
Yes, sir.

32:57.251 --> 33:00.630
Then he started doing his own stuff
and it's not bad. Give a listen.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.272
Very well, Mr. Sampson.

33:20.441 --> 33:23.861
Meet Mr. Ludwig as arranged.

33:23.944 --> 33:26.155
I have some thinking to do.

33:29.742 --> 33:31.368
What's going on?

33:32.244 --> 33:36.957
Lane is, at this very moment, giving
the finest performance of his career.

33:37.833 --> 33:38.959
What!

33:39.043 --> 33:40.711
Lane's twin brother...

33:40.794 --> 33:44.256
apparently is just as talented
as Lane himself.

33:44.548 --> 33:46.258
Well, let's hear it for Michael.

33:47.134 --> 33:49.595
I guess he fixed your wagon, "Crockton"?

33:50.679 --> 33:54.141
I'd worry about your wagon
if I were you, Mr. Kincaid.

33:54.933 --> 33:58.312
For you suddenly have become
about as useful to us...

33:58.645 --> 34:00.397
as a dead duck.

34:05.861 --> 34:08.322
What's the matter with him?
Why doesn't he call?

34:08.822 --> 34:10.282
What's he waiting for?

34:10.364 --> 34:12.117
He must have heard our kid went over big.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.659
Yeah, sure, he went over big!

34:13.744 --> 34:16.788
But he's not Lane!
It'll take years to get him to that place.

34:16.871 --> 34:18.498
I want Lane back!

34:18.623 --> 34:20.167
I want Lane and Michael.

34:20.250 --> 34:23.085
There's nothing wrong with that.
I mean, I'm gonna pay.

34:23.170 --> 34:26.005
Maybe the kidnapper figures
you got nothing to lose now.

34:26.089 --> 34:29.509
Maybe he thinks you'll try a double-cross
if he tries to return Lane.

34:29.592 --> 34:33.179
Come on. He's gotta return Lane!
What else is he gonna do with him?

34:34.639 --> 34:35.806
No!

34:36.141 --> 34:37.516
He wouldn't...

34:46.860 --> 34:51.072
I'm afraid no brilliant alternative
occurred to me during the night.

34:52.157 --> 34:54.034
The boy is just...

34:54.951 --> 34:56.786
too great a liability.

34:58.121 --> 35:00.206
Alert Sampson and Ludwig.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.377
We'll dispose of him at the yard.

35:05.378 --> 35:06.671
Yes, sir.

35:10.049 --> 35:12.886
Look, Sergeant, I want to speak
to your superior.

35:13.011 --> 35:14.137
Hello?

35:18.183 --> 35:19.767
Cops wouldn't believe you?

35:19.851 --> 35:22.312
Are you kidding?
After that concert last night?

35:22.896 --> 35:24.063
What have I done?

35:24.230 --> 35:26.274
There's gotta be somebody
that can help us.

35:27.900 --> 35:29.152
Wait a minute.

35:29.777 --> 35:31.654
There was this lady at the junkyard...

35:31.738 --> 35:33.156
She knew about the kidnapping.

35:34.407 --> 35:37.368
But I don't where to find her.
I don't even know who she is.

35:37.452 --> 35:39.662
Whitney, we traced your steps.

35:40.079 --> 35:41.164
Okay.

35:41.247 --> 35:43.291
You have got to remember
what that man said...

35:43.374 --> 35:45.918
- when he kidnapped Lane.
- I'm trying.

35:46.627 --> 35:47.712
Think.

35:47.795 --> 35:49.672
He must have said something.

35:50.089 --> 35:52.675
Something that made you think
they were going to kill him?

35:54.218 --> 35:57.263
Lane said something like,
"Where are we going?"

35:58.055 --> 36:00.391
And the man said something like...

36:02.184 --> 36:03.978
"To get what you deserve...

36:06.230 --> 36:07.898
"To get your reward...

36:08.441 --> 36:09.984
"your just reward. "

36:10.359 --> 36:11.444
That's it!

36:11.527 --> 36:13.863
He said:
"I'm taking you to your just reward. "

36:13.946 --> 36:16.365
That's what made me think
they were gonna kill him!

36:17.450 --> 36:19.452
But if they weren't going to kill him...

36:19.535 --> 36:21.162
why would they say that?

36:21.871 --> 36:24.874
They must be talking about
where they're holding him.

36:25.416 --> 36:26.917
They took him where?

36:27.001 --> 36:28.961
His manager said...

36:29.879 --> 36:33.257
that the phone calls sounded
long distance, ship-to-shore.

36:33.966 --> 36:35.801
"Your just reward. "

36:41.348 --> 36:43.684
Operator? This is an emergency.

36:43.976 --> 36:45.144
Get me the Coast Guard.

36:45.227 --> 36:46.603
The name of the boat!

36:47.104 --> 36:48.188
Maybe.

36:48.397 --> 36:49.523
Just maybe.

36:57.990 --> 37:00.659
Let's go, kid. Your singing days are over.

37:01.243 --> 37:03.620
In fact, it looks like
all your days are over.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.167
Didn't Crichton talk to Ash?

37:08.500 --> 37:10.794
It's too risky. What can I say?

37:11.253 --> 37:13.130
In my business, these things happen.

37:15.257 --> 37:16.425
Come on.

37:18.176 --> 37:19.303
Let's go.

37:19.720 --> 37:20.762
Come on.

37:24.850 --> 37:26.351
Thank you, Captain.

37:26.685 --> 37:27.853
Good.

37:28.061 --> 37:29.521
I'll be waiting.

37:30.939 --> 37:32.607
What'd they say?

37:32.691 --> 37:36.027
There is a boat out of Marina del Rey
called Your Just Reward.

37:36.111 --> 37:38.488
And the Coast Guard is trying to locate it.

37:39.030 --> 37:41.116
Do you think they've killed Lane yet?

37:42.909 --> 37:47.372
Well, from what my boss in Washington
has told me about the kidnappers...

37:47.539 --> 37:49.583
if they haven't killed him yet...

37:49.666 --> 37:52.419
it's only because Crichton
hasn't figured out...

37:52.502 --> 37:54.588
the tidiest possible way to do it.

38:06.891 --> 38:08.893
Skyview 3 to Central.

38:15.150 --> 38:17.527
They are now in a gray sedan...

38:17.610 --> 38:22.031
license number 247 PCE.

38:27.161 --> 38:28.329
Yes?

38:28.871 --> 38:31.082
That's right. What've you got?

38:35.545 --> 38:37.130
Well, do you know where they're heading?

38:38.673 --> 38:40.758
Okay, well, please, keep me posted.

38:41.092 --> 38:42.260
Thank you.

38:43.010 --> 38:44.595
What's happening?

38:44.762 --> 38:48.349
They've got Lane in a car,
headed away from the ocean.

38:48.433 --> 38:49.767
And the police are after them.

38:49.851 --> 38:52.395
Let's get going.
We're not doing any good here.

38:52.478 --> 38:55.231
- Maybe there'll be a-
- You're going home, young lady.

38:55.314 --> 38:56.607
No, Diana.

38:56.691 --> 38:58.276
Listen, Whitney.

38:58.359 --> 39:01.654
Whatever does finally happen,
I don't want you involved.

39:01.737 --> 39:03.239
Diana, please.

39:05.032 --> 39:07.952
I'll go. But you gotta promise
to call and keep me posted.

39:08.035 --> 39:09.620
I promise. Now go.

39:38.232 --> 39:41.277
Mr. Ludwig should be ready by now,
don't you think?

39:41.443 --> 39:42.945
We'll soon find out.

40:38.750 --> 40:40.585
Ludwig will lose them in no time.

40:40.669 --> 40:41.711
Good.

40:41.795 --> 40:44.756
Then let's take care of
our immediate problem...

40:44.840 --> 40:46.967
so we can join him at the airport.

40:50.387 --> 40:52.264
What do you mean, you lost them?

40:54.558 --> 40:57.185
Well, have you any idea
where they're headed?

40:59.646 --> 41:01.398
Thanks, anyway, Lieutenant.

41:08.154 --> 41:09.698
The junkyard.

41:49.904 --> 41:51.030
Oh, no.

41:52.740 --> 41:54.283
It won't even turn over.

41:54.367 --> 41:57.495
You should always take a taxi
when you have to get somewhere.

41:57.578 --> 41:59.122
What're we gonna do now?

41:59.205 --> 42:01.207
You are going to listen to me,
young lady...

42:01.290 --> 42:03.626
and do no less than what I tell you.

42:03.709 --> 42:06.295
Now, I want you go over to that store,
call the police...

42:06.379 --> 42:10.633
and tell them to get out to the junkyard
at Washington and 89th immediately.

42:10.716 --> 42:13.052
And then you stay put. Promise.

42:13.636 --> 42:14.762
What are you gonna do?

42:14.845 --> 42:17.515
I am going to call your father
unless you promise.

42:18.140 --> 42:19.225
Okay.

42:23.312 --> 42:24.397
Go.

43:27.042 --> 43:28.752
Let me show you something.

45:04.430 --> 45:06.891
How do you like your new manager so far?

45:06.974 --> 45:09.143
He's great but I miss Ash, you know?

45:09.227 --> 45:11.687
But he couldn't handle
the kidnapping thing too well.

45:11.771 --> 45:15.358
The police and the FBl weren't too thrilled
with his behavior, either.

45:15.858 --> 45:17.318
There you go.

45:23.574 --> 45:25.868
I don't know about you,
but this girl saved my life.

45:25.951 --> 45:27.912
She deserves more than an autograph.

45:31.749 --> 45:34.543
And if it weren't for her,
we'd never be together again.

45:37.671 --> 45:39.673
Lane. Michael. Let's go!

45:41.634 --> 45:44.512
Well, it's good seeing you again, so long.

45:44.595 --> 45:46.263
Thank you very much for all your help.

45:46.347 --> 45:48.182
And it was nice meeting you, Miss Prince.

45:48.265 --> 45:49.767
Break a leg, guys.

45:55.189 --> 45:57.441
I may as well die now, Diana.

45:57.608 --> 45:58.692
What?

45:59.443 --> 46:01.487
I have nothing left to live for.

46:04.031 --> 46:07.034
Well, how about
a hot fudge sundae after the show?

46:07.117 --> 46:08.202
With peanuts?

46:08.285 --> 46:09.411
The works.

46:09.495 --> 46:10.579
You're on!

47:48.301 --> 47:49.385
