WEBVTT

00:05.140 --> 00:06.600
Yeah, l still have to write an essay

00:06.740 --> 00:09.470
so l'll get chosen to go
to the World School Summit at the U.N.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.670
Yeah, once you said essay,
all l heard was blah, blah, blah.

00:12.810 --> 00:16.270
Okay, let's talk about my day.
Like this guy who thinks of me as a friend.

00:16.410 --> 00:17.810
But not for long. l have a plan.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.010
Fascinating.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.210
Back to me,
l'm competing against this kiss-up

00:22.350 --> 00:24.650
who has no right being chosen
for the World School Summit.

00:25.220 --> 00:27.520
Seriously, you have to make your stories
more interesting,

00:27.660 --> 00:30.680
because all l'm hearing
is blah, blah, blah.

00:32.060 --> 00:34.460
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, kids.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.930
lt's okay. l got this.

00:37.470 --> 00:38.870
Okay, here's my plan.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.030
This guy and l have gone out
in a group as friends,

00:41.170 --> 00:42.230
never just the two of us.

00:42.370 --> 00:45.040
But there's a concert in Central Park
and we're going as friends,

00:45.180 --> 00:47.770
but coming back
as boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:47.910 --> 00:49.670
And there he is.

00:50.310 --> 00:51.910
My future boyfriend.

00:52.050 --> 00:53.520
That guy?

00:53.650 --> 00:55.950
That's Brad,
the guy l'm competing against.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.680
Hey, Brad. Can't wait for the concert.

00:57.820 --> 00:58.880
Oh, hey, Alex.

00:59.020 --> 01:00.650
Oh, Mrs. Russo,
let me help you with that.

01:01.630 --> 01:03.350
Now, what kind of a world
would let someone

01:03.490 --> 01:06.830
as petite and delicate as you
carry such a heavy box?

01:07.160 --> 01:08.430
My world.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.530
See? He's a kiss-up.

01:12.670 --> 01:14.860
He's not a kiss-up.
He's good at getting what he wants.

01:15.010 --> 01:17.130
That's one of the things
we have in common.

01:17.270 --> 01:18.670
That guy makes me so mad.

01:18.810 --> 01:21.240
Another thing we have in common.
We both like making you mad.

01:24.550 --> 01:25.610
Oh, hey, guys.

01:25.750 --> 01:29.150
Max is trying wizard
training exercise number five. Again.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.750
l can do it. l know l can levitate this can.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.460 --> 01:41.930
That's bunk. l can't do it.

01:42.070 --> 01:43.930
Don't worry, buddy. lt'll happen.

01:44.070 --> 01:46.400
Keep working on lesson number five.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.010
And you two,
we're on lesson number 372.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.300
Now, who can guess what these are?

01:55.650 --> 01:56.700
lt's charades.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.110
Raiders of the Lost Ark, Yes.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.740
No. l'm showing different emotions.

02:01.890 --> 02:05.550
Today's lesson is about potions
that make you have emotions.

02:05.690 --> 02:06.920
Emotion potions.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.860
Not potions
that make you move quicker or slower.

02:09.990 --> 02:12.860
Those are motion potions.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.660
Did you see what l just did?

02:15.670 --> 02:17.220
Yeah. That was a crime of a rhyme.

02:17.370 --> 02:20.030
Wow, that was lame and l'm ashamed.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.970
Now, the most important thing
to remember

02:23.110 --> 02:26.100
is when an emotion potion
is shared by two people,

02:26.240 --> 02:28.510
they both experience
the same emotion.

02:28.650 --> 02:30.510
Now come on, Justin,
let's give a potion a try.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.080
Pick a potion, any potion.

02:33.420 --> 02:34.480
Not that one.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.180
That one. Yeah.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.720
Good. That was my second choice.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.080
Here we go.

02:43.890 --> 02:45.560
Bottoms up.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.090
Okay.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.930
ln a few seconds, the spell will activate

02:55.070 --> 02:58.910
and Justin and l will become mad
at each other for no reason at all.

03:04.280 --> 03:07.340
l'm feeling kind of angry.
l think it's working, Dad.

03:07.480 --> 03:08.780
You're the best teacher ever.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.080
Oh, no, no. Don't put that on me.

03:11.220 --> 03:15.090
You're a great student
and l am really proud of you.

03:15.630 --> 03:18.120
Oh, yeah? Well, you're the best dad
in the whole wide world.

03:18.260 --> 03:19.660
How about that?

03:20.360 --> 03:21.520
l love you.

03:21.670 --> 03:22.930
l love you more.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.360
Yeah.

03:27.100 --> 03:28.590
- Look at them.
- What's the big deal?

03:28.740 --> 03:31.800
l've seen them do that
over the toy in the cereal box.

03:31.940 --> 03:33.430
Yeah.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.160
- How do l look?
- Why?

04:28.300 --> 04:30.200
Because l'm gonna see Brad at school.

04:30.330 --> 04:32.300
l've stopped with the ponytail,
which says friend,

04:32.440 --> 04:35.100
and l've gone to full hair,
so l can flip it like this.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.730
Because that says girlfriend.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.240
Mom, l don't feel so good.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.680
Oh, honey.

04:43.410 --> 04:44.680
You don't feel warm.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.650
All right. Who's doing this?
Put me down.

04:55.790 --> 04:56.950
- l'm not doing it.
- l can't.

04:57.090 --> 04:58.790
Not me. Why would--?

04:58.930 --> 05:00.230
- lt's me?
- Yep.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.860
lt's all you.
Hey, your full powers are here.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.370
You're in the competition with us.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.440
So what? l'm still gonna win
and be the one that keeps his powers.

05:07.570 --> 05:09.730
No, l'm the one
who's keeping his powers.

05:09.870 --> 05:12.360
l'm taking you both down.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.980
Now, how do l get down?

05:16.310 --> 05:19.280
Now that your full powers are here,
it's time for the hat.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.250
- Oh, the hat.
- Not the hat.

05:21.390 --> 05:23.910
- What hat?
- Dad, that hat is so ugly.

05:24.050 --> 05:25.520
What hat?

05:25.660 --> 05:27.750
l can't believe
my mijito's ready for the hat.

05:27.890 --> 05:30.160
Somebody tell me
about the hat already.

05:30.290 --> 05:31.990
The hat will keep your powers
under control

05:32.130 --> 05:34.030
for a few days while they settle in.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.130
Alex, give him the hat.

05:45.740 --> 05:46.970
This?

05:47.110 --> 05:50.100
l am not wearing this thing to school.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.680
Max, we all had to wear it.
Just do what l did.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.480
l wore some really ugly earrings
to distract from the ugly hat.

05:57.950 --> 05:59.080
That shirt will do.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.120
Come on, let's go to school.

06:07.300 --> 06:11.320
There's no way l'm wearing
this leaning tower of velvet to school.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.240
Wow, what happened to our roof?
lt's snowing.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.610
Your hat.

06:21.750 --> 06:24.650
Right, it will protect me from the snow.

06:25.350 --> 06:27.370
No, it caused the snow.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.810
Keep your hat on.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.950
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Brad.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.350
What's that all over you?

06:40.160 --> 06:42.500
Dandruff. Really bad dandruff.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.570
lt runs in our family.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.200
No, wait. lt's snow.
l saw it snowing in there.

06:48.340 --> 06:51.000
Oh, Brad. You're so funny.

06:51.140 --> 06:54.270
lf we were going in a group to the concert,
everyone would laugh at you.

06:54.410 --> 06:56.470
But it's just us two.

06:56.710 --> 06:58.540
ln the park.

06:58.980 --> 07:00.750
On Saturday.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.950
ls there something wrong
with your neck?

07:05.420 --> 07:06.890
l'm just real excited for Saturday.

07:07.020 --> 07:09.120
You know what?
There is something wrong with my neck.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.420
Could you rub it for me, please?

07:12.360 --> 07:14.490
Oh, Saturday. l forgot, l can't.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.160
That's the night of the World Summit.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.860
What? That was the night
of the group thing with just you and me.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.630
How are you sure
you'll go to the summit?

07:20.770 --> 07:22.930
lt's not all about the schmoozing.
lt's about the work.

07:23.070 --> 07:24.700
You haven't done anything to deserve it.

07:25.180 --> 07:28.440
lt's always about the schmoozing,
Justin.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.840
- Nice haircut.
- Really?

07:30.980 --> 07:32.040
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

07:32.180 --> 07:36.120
l thought l might have gone too short,
but l wanted it sharp for the interviews.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.520
Hey, you're schmoozing me.

07:39.460 --> 07:40.860
What a jerk.

07:40.990 --> 07:42.050
He is so cute.

07:42.190 --> 07:43.590
He is...

07:49.470 --> 07:51.330
Nice job on the essay, Justin.

07:51.470 --> 07:52.630
Thank you, Mr. Laritate.

07:52.770 --> 07:55.570
Does this mean l'm gonna be
the World Summit delegate?

07:55.710 --> 07:59.160
Hold your horses, buckaroo.
You still have the home interview.

07:59.310 --> 08:02.010
Because hospitality is an important part
of being a world delegate.

08:02.510 --> 08:04.570
lt's down to you and Brad Sherwood.

08:04.710 --> 08:06.410
And you know Brad.

08:06.550 --> 08:09.250
He has such a way with people.

08:09.390 --> 08:11.320
Hey, Mr. Laritate.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.580
How were those brownies l sent you?

08:13.720 --> 08:14.990
You remembered, no nuts.

08:15.130 --> 08:17.220
Because of your allergies.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.390
- You baked brownies for Mr. Laritate?
- Yeah.

08:20.530 --> 08:21.660
l was already baking a batch

08:21.800 --> 08:24.430
for the group of seniors
l read to after school, so...

08:24.570 --> 08:25.630
l read to people too.

08:25.770 --> 08:26.830
l read to preschoolers,

08:26.970 --> 08:30.630
because they need someone
to read to them because they can't read.

08:31.740 --> 08:33.470
Kudos to you, Justin.

08:33.610 --> 08:36.100
lf only l weren't busy
coaching inner-city kids,

08:36.250 --> 08:38.650
l'd do more charity work.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.080
Compassion.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.210
Brad, that's exactly the quality

08:42.350 --> 08:44.790
l'm looking for in a delegate
to the World Summit.

08:45.490 --> 08:47.480
Good luck, Justin.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.960
Guess what.
lt is all about the schmoozing.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.190
l know, but l have an idea

08:56.330 --> 08:58.630
on how l can get Brad
to go to the concert with me.

08:58.770 --> 09:00.260
Why is it always about you?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.160
lf Brad goes to the concert with me,

09:02.310 --> 09:04.400
he'll drop out of the summit
and you'll be a shoo-in.

09:05.340 --> 09:06.740
Are we on the same side?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.040
lt's a little creepy, but l think we are.

09:09.180 --> 09:11.440
Here's the plan.
l'm gonna split a love potion with Brad.

09:11.580 --> 09:14.480
He'll be so in love with me,
he'll be dying to go to the concert with me.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.350
We can't do that. We're not supposed
to use magic unsupervised.

09:17.720 --> 09:20.380
You'll supervise me, l'll supervise you.
How is that unsupervised?

09:21.460 --> 09:22.650
lt'll have to do for now.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.230
Okay, Brad's here. Love potion time.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.170
lf l don't see it, l can say l didn't see it.

09:34.700 --> 09:35.800
Oh, my gosh.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.970
Made you look.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.410
Hey, Brad. Your order's ready.

09:45.550 --> 09:48.710
You might wanna start with the drink first
because the sandwich is a little dry.

09:49.350 --> 09:50.680
l didn't order yet.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.780
Yeah, but you and l just get each other.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.980
l know what you want.
Enjoy your drink.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.830
Quick. This guy needs a drink.

10:01.970 --> 10:03.190
- No, no.
- Here, take this.

10:03.330 --> 10:04.460
Wait. What are you doing?

10:05.400 --> 10:07.930
- l thought he'd like root beer better.
- Here.

10:08.310 --> 10:09.360
See?

10:09.510 --> 10:11.240
Worked like a charm.
Enjoy your sandwich.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.400
- Free refills.
- Hey, it's mine.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.580
That was close.

10:26.090 --> 10:27.650
Kitchen.

10:30.990 --> 10:32.330
Do you realize what you just did?

10:32.460 --> 10:34.620
Oh, my gosh.
l drank both halves of the love potion.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.890
So if he didn't drink it,
who falls in love with you?

10:42.470 --> 10:43.770
Oh, hello, gorgeous.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.900
Who is that?

10:48.380 --> 10:49.940
l think you fell in love with yourself.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.740
So what?
There's a lot about me to love.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.980
There's more now.

11:01.060 --> 11:04.290
Oh, that's what they mean when they say
you're getting a big head.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.560
Not as heavy as you think.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.330
Okay, we're just gonna say this:

11:15.470 --> 11:17.870
''Dad, completely by accident,
we mixed a love potion

11:18.010 --> 11:19.980
and then completely
by a different accident,

11:20.110 --> 11:21.410
Alex drank both halves of it.''

11:21.540 --> 11:23.540
- Think he'll believe that?
- Yes.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.480
lf l can get him to drink an
''l'll believe anything'' potion.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.810
l don't understand why Brad
doesn't think of me as a girlfriend.

11:30.950 --> 11:35.190
l'm beautiful, l'm funny,
and l always smell a little bit like vanilla.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.120
There's no way you can go out
with Brad looking like that.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.060
l'm gonna have to go back
to my original plan,

11:42.200 --> 11:44.000
beat Brad fair and square
with that interview.

11:44.130 --> 11:46.260
What about me?
l thought we were on the same side.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.530
Oh, no. That ended with the:

11:51.710 --> 11:55.580
l guess l was kind of stupid
for drinking both halves of the love potion.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.240
What did you just say?

11:59.380 --> 12:02.250
l said, l guess l was kind of stupid.

12:03.150 --> 12:04.350
That's it.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.790
Every time you brag about yourself,
your head gets bigger.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.080
Every time you bag on yourself,
your head gets smaller.

12:09.230 --> 12:11.090
So remember, bag, don't brag.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.720
Oh, l get it. Like,

12:13.730 --> 12:16.130
l can't think of anything wrong with me.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.430
l'm gonna work on a cheat sheet
of ways you can bag on yourself.

12:20.570 --> 12:23.560
Bag number one: you're stupid enough
to drink both halves of a love potion.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.550
Max. What are you doing?
Put your hat back on.

12:44.690 --> 12:47.420
l had it on,
but people keep making fun of me.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.100
Wear the hat for a few more days
till your powers come in.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.600
Jeez, you're in a mood.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.300
l got a lot going on.

12:58.010 --> 13:01.640
Brad Sherwood, you managed to outdo
yourself at the home interview last night.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.180
- Thank you.
- You better saddle up

13:03.310 --> 13:05.750
and get ready
for the World Summit, buckaroo.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.710
Oh, hello, Justin.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.580
You still want me to come over tonight?

13:13.460 --> 13:16.360
Yes. lt's a scheduled interview.
l'm still a finalist.

13:16.790 --> 13:19.130
Mr. Laritate,
have you been working out, sir?

13:19.260 --> 13:20.730
Well, you look great.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.900
Oh, my gosh.
Someone sent me flowers.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.660
l wonder who it could be.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.640
Me.

13:37.910 --> 13:39.350
Guys.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.450
Okay, so Mr. Laritate's coming,
so no one's gonna use magic.

13:42.590 --> 13:44.080
Are we clear?

13:44.220 --> 13:46.090
You're just gonna smile
and direct conversation

13:46.220 --> 13:49.660
to one of my many achievements,
conveniently listed on these cheat sheets.

13:49.790 --> 13:51.490
One, two.

13:52.230 --> 13:53.290
Wow, this is tiny.

13:53.430 --> 13:56.920
lf this was a list of my achievements,
it would be way longer.

13:58.740 --> 14:00.260
- Alex.
- Sorry.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.500
''Alex doesn't play well with others.''

14:02.640 --> 14:04.370
You make a lot of cheat sheets.

14:05.940 --> 14:07.470
He's here.

14:09.210 --> 14:10.680
Ready?

14:11.850 --> 14:16.110
Hello. l'm Justin's mom, Theresa,
and it's so nice to meet you.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.150
Hi, l'm Mr. Laritate.

14:18.290 --> 14:20.310
Come on in.
You know Justin, of course.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.430
This is my daughter, Alex,
and my other son, Max.

14:24.190 --> 14:26.990
Jerry is out on the terrace
cooking our steaks.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.990
Jerry's Justin's dad.

14:29.130 --> 14:30.390
And also my husband.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.890
l felt the need to say both

14:32.040 --> 14:34.600
because in these modern times,
you just can't assume that.

14:36.610 --> 14:37.660
Let's sit down.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.300
Aren't you a spirited filly?

14:44.810 --> 14:46.210
Speaking of spirited filly,

14:46.350 --> 14:49.250
you know who rode a pony by himself
when he was 9?

14:49.390 --> 14:50.580
My brother Justin.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.750
Look, l believe
in being a straight shooter.

14:55.890 --> 14:59.560
Your boy Justin
is a long shot for the World Summit.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.360
Well, let me tell you
about my strengths.

15:01.500 --> 15:05.190
My dedication to academics,
my interest in geopolitics.

15:05.340 --> 15:10.070
Of course, he knows all the words
to almost all of the U2 songs.

15:10.210 --> 15:13.110
Okay, we're done with this. Go. Get.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.770
Look, l'm an upright hombre.

15:15.910 --> 15:18.470
So l'd like to give you a fair shake.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.510
How would you handle a situation

15:20.650 --> 15:23.950
where two delegates at the summit
get into a strong disagreement?

15:24.850 --> 15:26.190
Well, first, l would--

15:26.320 --> 15:27.910
l'll tell you what l would do.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.650
l would use my bubbly personality

15:29.790 --> 15:32.920
to get them to both agree with me,
since l'm always right.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.990
Hey, did l show you
my second-grade soccer trophy?

15:39.170 --> 15:40.230
lt's for participation.

15:40.370 --> 15:42.400
l didn't play,
but l was nice to everyone. Here.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.470
l do more than participate. l'm a leader.

15:44.610 --> 15:48.840
ln fact, l set fashion trends at school
on a regular basis.

15:50.110 --> 15:52.880
Read this. lt's the W volume.

15:56.720 --> 16:00.380
Oh, good. The magic in that hat
keeps your head normal size.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.220
But what about Max's powers?

16:03.590 --> 16:05.250
l'll get it.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.330
Brad.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.370
You couldn't stay away from me,
could you?

16:13.900 --> 16:15.870
Oh, Alex. You get me.

16:16.010 --> 16:17.910
That's why l brought you
these chocolates. Here.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.800
Wow, candy.
Like what a boyfriend would give a--

16:20.940 --> 16:23.610
- ls that Mr. Laritate?
- Come on in.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.270
Oh, hey, Mr. Laritate. Nice to--

16:26.280 --> 16:27.340
You're not here for Alex.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.250
You're here
because it's my interview night.

16:30.720 --> 16:34.380
ls tonight the night of your interview?
Well, l had no idea.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.360
Hey, Mr. Laritate. Check it out.

16:36.490 --> 16:39.720
Hey, we're the bolo boys.

16:39.860 --> 16:42.590
Bolo ties. Why didn't l think of that?

16:42.730 --> 16:45.390
What are you doing with your hat off?
We've got Mr. Laritate over.

16:45.540 --> 16:47.230
And that guy.

16:47.970 --> 16:49.030
Who's that guy?

16:49.170 --> 16:51.070
He's Brad. He's my new boyfriend.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.970
l'll decide who your new boyfriend is.

16:53.110 --> 16:56.040
Mr. Russo, did you make this salsa?
lt's fresh.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.510
You grow cilantro out on your terrace,
don't you?

16:58.950 --> 17:02.040
Yes. l like your new boyfriend.

17:09.460 --> 17:10.790
Why is your head getting bigger?

17:11.230 --> 17:12.890
lt's not.
Maybe you're standing too close.

17:13.030 --> 17:14.589
Oh, nice try.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.890
You drank both halves of a potion,
didn't you?

17:17.030 --> 17:18.829
Yes, but it was for a good reason.

17:18.970 --> 17:21.270
l wanted Brad to like me
more than just a friend.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.839
So you'd be okay with a guy liking you
just because he's under a spell?

17:24.970 --> 17:26.740
That's the best part.
He's not under a spell.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.900
l messed it up,
and he still brought me chocolates.

17:29.050 --> 17:31.780
Well, then l guess
everything's okay, isn't it?

17:31.910 --> 17:34.250
l don't feel like steaks.

17:34.380 --> 17:37.750
l've got a craving for Chinese food.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.720
Wonder who that could be.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.380
l'll just go and see.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.900
Who ordered Chinese food?

17:58.040 --> 17:59.970
l love Chinese food.

18:00.110 --> 18:03.310
Alex, Justin,
can l show you something?

18:03.780 --> 18:06.510
Come on. Come on.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.150
Does this look okay to you guys?

18:19.300 --> 18:21.020
Because l don't remember moving.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.160
To China!

18:24.430 --> 18:26.160
We didn't do this magic, Dad. l swear.

18:26.300 --> 18:27.360
No, Max did.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.700
Because he can't wear his hat,
because you have to.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.400
And we can't fix any of this right now
because of all those people inside.

18:33.540 --> 18:36.340
So why don't we get those people
to go home?

18:36.750 --> 18:40.180
They're 6,000 miles away
from their homes.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.150
So, what are we gonna do?

18:46.960 --> 18:49.550
Wow, whatever Max craves,
that's where the loft moves.

18:49.890 --> 18:52.220
He does love pineapple.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.560
Oh, l've never been to Hawaii.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.930
Come on. We gotta get out of here.
Come on.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.270
Act natural.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.570
Wow, l never expected to be entertained
with food from all over the world.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.380
This is quite the hoedown.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.780
Spectacular.

19:19.520 --> 19:20.680
lt's too spectacular.

19:20.820 --> 19:22.790
There's something going on here,
Mr. Laritate.

19:22.930 --> 19:25.920
Yeah, you better fix
that hitch in your giddyup.

19:26.300 --> 19:29.230
What Justin did
was bring world cultures together,

19:29.370 --> 19:32.770
demonstrating his passion
for world affairs.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.030
You know what, Justin?

19:34.170 --> 19:37.200
These are the qualities l'm looking for.

19:37.340 --> 19:40.570
- You're going to the World Summit.
- Oh, my gosh.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.970
That's great. l won?

19:43.110 --> 19:44.670
l lost? l never lose.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.280
l came here to make sure that l won.

19:46.420 --> 19:47.710
That's why you came here?

19:47.850 --> 19:50.150
l even bought this stupid bolo tie.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.480
Bolo ties are not stupid.

19:53.620 --> 19:55.920
They are the official neckwear
of Arizona.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.790
Sloppy, sloppy work.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.690
You know, l'm gonna get my wife
so we can take these lessons together.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.670
- You can't leave. Stay.
- What's the rush?

20:07.800 --> 20:10.170
Mr. Laritate,
could you hold on just one moment?

20:11.870 --> 20:13.430
Brad, you didn't come here for me.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.740
You came here for you.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.640
l wanted us to be more than friends,
but you're not even a friend.

20:17.780 --> 20:19.750
l think we should break up.

20:20.280 --> 20:23.380
Break up? We were never going out.

20:24.620 --> 20:27.610
Well, in my mind, we were.
But now that's all over.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.550
How does it feel
to be theoretically dumped?

20:34.130 --> 20:35.360
Brad, you can go.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.660
And, Mr. Laritate,
thanks for stopping by.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.600
Oh, l'll be back.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.300
Better luck next time, Brad.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.500
And since you think it's so stupid,

20:45.640 --> 20:49.130
you, sir, have no right to wear this.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.140
Well,

20:56.290 --> 20:59.810
l guess since l'm free Saturday night,
l can go to that concert with you.

21:00.220 --> 21:01.380
l don't think so.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.890
l'm nobody's second choice,
because l'm a prize.

21:06.030 --> 21:07.360
l've never noticed before,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.360
but your head's a little too big
for your body.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.730
l know. Goodbye.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.230
Fine. Fine.

21:12.370 --> 21:13.770
There's something weird about this.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.200
And there's something weird
about all you Russos.

21:18.340 --> 21:19.670
l'm gonna find out what it is.

21:19.810 --> 21:22.040
Well, good luck with that, Brad.
Goodbye.

21:22.680 --> 21:23.840
Yes.

21:23.980 --> 21:27.580
Well, congratulations on winning
your World Summit dele-geek thing.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.780
Thanks.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.720
Sorry about what happened
with you and Brad.

21:30.850 --> 21:31.910
Oh, it's okay.

21:32.050 --> 21:35.080
l don't know if you noticed,
but he was a real schmoozer.

21:35.220 --> 21:37.590
Oh, really? You just noticed?

21:37.730 --> 21:40.560
Dad, how long do we got to live
with Big Head over here?

21:41.700 --> 21:44.190
lt could be a few weeks
before it wears off.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.500
Hey, or we could try this.

21:49.910 --> 21:51.130
Okay. There you go.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.500
Now, clean this up.

22:00.850 --> 22:03.320
Oh, that is so sweet.

22:05.390 --> 22:08.320
- Where did all this come from?
- Me.

22:09.030 --> 22:11.020
- l thought the potion wore off.
- lt did.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.150
What didn't wear off is how good l feel
about sending myself flowers.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.060
Who's gonna be kinder to me than me?

22:16.200 --> 22:18.170
Certainly not me.

22:18.930 --> 22:20.400
Oh, my gosh.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.600
l am so funny. l didn't see that coming.
