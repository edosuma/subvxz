WEBVTT

00:03.904 --> 00:05.039
No!

00:05.106 --> 00:08.142
Is there an e-mail
from the Event Committee?

00:08.209 --> 00:09.643
SIRI: I can't answer that.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.246
You can't
or you won't?

00:12.313 --> 00:14.182
You and Siri
fighting again?

00:14.248 --> 00:15.483
(CHUCKLES)
I get it.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.018
Yeah, my Roomba and I
fight all the time.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.491
Guys, the Welltopia banquet
is this weekend,

00:23.557 --> 00:26.794
and the Event Committee
still hasn't called
to ask me to emcee.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.961
You know,
I'm gonna check

00:28.028 --> 00:29.230
to make sure
the phones are working.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.331
(DIAL TONE)

00:30.398 --> 00:32.533
They're working.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.702
I've hosted
five years running,

00:34.768 --> 00:36.604
and that was before
my legendary performance

00:36.670 --> 00:38.272
at the legendary
Laugh Factory.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.075
Okay, to be clear,

00:41.142 --> 00:43.711
you did a five-minute set
for friends and family

00:43.777 --> 00:45.646
on a Tuesday
at sundown.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.816
Yeah, and you're still
talking about it.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.753
How many psychiatrists does it
take to change a light bulb?

00:52.820 --> 00:55.356
None, unless it's ready
to change.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.790
(LAUGHTER)

01:00.694 --> 01:03.997
That's just a little taste
of what you'll be getting
when I host the banquet.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.633
Good crowd.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.302
Good crowd.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.470
You?

01:09.537 --> 01:11.205
They asked you
to host the banquet?

01:11.272 --> 01:12.640
Mm-hmm.
Why?

01:12.706 --> 01:14.308
I don't know,
I guess maybe they wanted

01:14.375 --> 01:16.043
more thinking man's comedy

01:16.110 --> 01:17.511
and less
desperate man's comedy.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.481
You know,
more cerebral humor

01:20.548 --> 01:23.317
and less of the rubber-faced
clowning that is your
trademark.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.828
Did you guys
know about this?

01:37.598 --> 01:39.400
A little bit, we did.

01:40.801 --> 01:44.438
But we were maybe scared
to tell you.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.274
Because (CHUCKLES)

01:46.340 --> 01:49.042
we thought you would go crazy.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.280
P.S. I wanted
to tell you.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.148
I like a little crazy
to break up my work day.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.093
Thank you...

02:06.160 --> 02:09.463
for being honest with me,
but I'm fine.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.666
And I'll actually be able
to enjoy the banquet for once.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.068
(CHUCKLES)
You never get to eat
when you emcee.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.807
Have a great morning.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.619
It was in the way.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.460
Why would they ask Pat
to host?

02:39.527 --> 02:41.161
Maybe they want
to give someone else a turn.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.564
You don't ask Mark Zuckerberg
to step down

02:43.631 --> 02:45.533
to give someone else
a turn.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.736
You're the Mark Zuckerberg
of hosting HMO banquets?

02:48.802 --> 02:51.905
I was until the
Event Committee
Winklevossed me.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.443
Forget it.
You're not a comedy person.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.745
Hey, I'm the funniest person
in my book club.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.747
(SCOFFS)
Book club funny?

02:59.813 --> 03:02.350
That's like saying
I'm the smartest guy
at my gym.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.419
When did you join
a gym?

03:05.486 --> 03:07.821
The point is...

03:07.888 --> 03:10.057
you know how much
this banquet means to me.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.259
Okay, look.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.294
Instead of stewing
and brooding,

03:13.361 --> 03:15.429
maybe you'd feel better
if you took the high road.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.832
Oh, yeah.
I'll consider that never.

03:18.899 --> 03:22.736
The low road's easier,
it's faster, it's on brand.

03:22.803 --> 03:26.039
Ken, you've gotten a lot
of validation for your comedy.

03:26.106 --> 03:28.542
You can afford to be
emotionally generous
with Pat.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.145
You're right.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.314
I am?

03:34.715 --> 03:38.952
This lame HMO banquet
is beneath me now.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.722
But it's the only kind
of garbage gig Pat can get.

03:43.257 --> 03:47.595
I can throw Pat a bone
because I am made of bones.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.665
You know what? I'll go get
Pat a bottle of scotch

03:51.732 --> 03:55.603
and say, "Congratulations,
it isn't easy stealing a job

03:55.669 --> 03:57.905
"from a more deserving
candidate."

03:59.573 --> 04:01.141
I'm sort of proud
of you.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.010
Thank you, Allison.
I'm a very good person.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.813
Humble, too.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.281
Humble, too.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.368
Uh...why
is the neighbor girl

04:27.435 --> 04:30.237
standing outside the kitchen
window creepy-staring at you?

04:31.204 --> 04:33.006
Emily? She likes me.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.719
How long
does she just stand there?

04:45.786 --> 04:48.055
Depends. Sometimes
she takes a break to eat.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.023
Sometimes
she just powers through.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.430
Uh, Dave,
you have a stalker.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.067
I don't like
to put labels on things.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.537
Well, I do,
and I would label this

05:03.604 --> 05:05.506
with a "W" for "weird."

05:09.743 --> 05:11.845
Don't encourage her.
You want to get rid of her.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.381
How do I do that?

05:13.447 --> 05:14.515
Aah!
She's still here?

05:20.354 --> 05:21.789
And don't come back!

05:23.290 --> 05:24.625
(CHUCKLES)

05:26.694 --> 05:28.462
Eric, I don't work hard
all day

05:28.529 --> 05:31.532
to come home and eat leftovers
out of a damn doggy ba...

05:31.599 --> 05:34.234
Excuse me, 'scuse me?
What you call me?

05:34.301 --> 05:37.070
Uh-huh,
that's what I thought!

05:37.137 --> 05:39.573
Oh, my God,
is everything okay
with you and Eric?

05:39.640 --> 05:40.974
Yeah, why?

05:42.610 --> 05:44.344
Speaking of Eric...

05:45.145 --> 05:46.814
Always eavesdropping.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.817
Will he be attending the
banquet as your guest?

05:49.883 --> 05:52.920
Yes, Pat, just like
I told you yesterday
and the day before.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.655
Well, relationships
are volatile,

05:54.722 --> 05:56.189
and I'm in charge
of the plus-ones.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.392
So sue me
for being thorough!

05:59.460 --> 06:00.661
Oh, uh,
Connor is coming, too.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.129
Yeah, whatever.

06:03.296 --> 06:06.266
Okay. So, are you
bringing anyone, Pat?

06:06.333 --> 06:08.035
Well, it would
hardly seem appropriate

06:08.101 --> 06:10.704
to bring a date to
a work event where
you know an ex-lover...

06:10.771 --> 06:12.440
Mmm, is going to be.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.576
Would it, hmm?

06:16.243 --> 06:17.611
Would it?

06:18.846 --> 06:22.382
Listen, I am so glad
that Eric is my plus-one.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.284
This is easily
the best relationship

06:24.351 --> 06:25.553
I've been
in in a long time...

06:25.619 --> 06:27.354
Some people
are still eavesdropping!

06:31.091 --> 06:32.826
You're leaving early,
Mr. Dr. Ken.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.028
You get fired?

06:35.095 --> 06:37.698
No. No, I'm just heading
to the liquor store.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.767
Oh, 'cause I was gonna
give your parking spot

06:39.833 --> 06:41.735
to the new Ears, Noses,
and Throats guy.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.704
Super cool.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.639
Real people person.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.441
Already
remembered my birthday.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.978
Sorry, Juan-Julio.
Not fired.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.580
I'm sorry, too.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.053
Ahh.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.023
Find the nearest
liquor store.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.758
SIRI:
Licorice store.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.560
Not licorice store!

07:07.360 --> 07:09.530
Liquor...store!

07:09.597 --> 07:11.465
Livermore,
California.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.033
Aah! I hate you!

07:13.100 --> 07:14.768
I hate you!
I hate you!

07:22.342 --> 07:23.544
(GASPS)

07:25.879 --> 07:27.247
You hit
your boss's car.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.851
(HIGH-PITCHED WHINE)

07:30.918 --> 07:33.721
I can't wait to tell the Ears,
Noses, and Throats guy
the good news.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.557
Mr. Dr. Gary!

07:50.037 --> 07:51.271
Pat.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.841
Did you park
in your spot today?

07:55.208 --> 07:56.376
Why wouldn't I?

07:56.443 --> 07:58.912
So, your license plate says
"Boyy Toyy"?

08:00.047 --> 08:03.851
I'm a boy,
and it's my toy.

08:03.917 --> 08:07.521
I feel terrible because
I backed into your boy toy.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.893
You did,
you did what?

08:12.960 --> 08:14.227
Don't, don't,
don't worry.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.163
No, my insurance will pay
for everything,

08:16.229 --> 08:18.098
and, oh,
and...here.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.237
Well, well, well.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.540
I guess it wasn't enough
to wallow in jealousy

08:26.607 --> 08:28.876
over my hosting
the banquet, no.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.311
You had to take it out
on my boy toy.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.982
No, no, Pat!

08:35.048 --> 08:36.717
(CHUCKLING)
It was an accident.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.151
(CHUCKLES)

08:38.218 --> 08:40.120
Damona, you believe me,
don't you?

08:41.789 --> 08:42.923
Clark.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.325
Sweet, sweet Clark.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.695
You believe me,
don't you?

08:47.761 --> 08:49.830
I believe
it's what you believe.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.464
Clark, what the...

08:51.531 --> 08:53.567
Oh, Juan-Julio.
You were there.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.202
Thank God.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.704
Can you
find the security footage?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.171
You bet
I might be able to.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.746
Okay, uh, just have to
type in my password.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.253
A little privacies?

09:16.757 --> 09:18.325
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)

09:18.391 --> 09:19.492
Okay.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.229
Oh, it's running
kind of slow.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.597
Damona, can I close out
these windows?

09:23.664 --> 09:25.132
Oh, yeah,
just keep my e-mail open.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.667
Oh, wait, is that that
Groupon you were
telling me about?

09:26.734 --> 09:28.235
Yeah, honey.
Raglin Brothers, we going.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.970
Just show
the tape already!

09:33.006 --> 09:34.642
Aah! I hate you!
I hate you!

09:37.510 --> 09:40.981
I wasn't yelling at Pat.
I was yelling at Siri.
It was her fault!

09:41.048 --> 09:43.283
Oh, sure.
Blame the woman.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.654
No! I was
taking the high road!

09:46.720 --> 09:48.355
Ken, you wouldn't know
the high road

09:48.421 --> 09:50.190
if you were driving
in the Alps.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.326
And those
are clearly high roads!

10:01.168 --> 10:02.703
Are you looking
for neighbor girl?

10:02.770 --> 10:04.104
She was here before.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.205
She was?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.740
I turn on sprinklers.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.812
Dave,
if you miss Emily,

10:11.879 --> 10:13.947
maybe she was more
than just a stalker.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.282
You think so?

10:15.348 --> 10:17.017
I mean,
it's a little weird,

10:17.084 --> 10:18.886
but you do a lot
of weird things,

10:18.952 --> 10:21.288
like get dressed for school
the night before

10:21.354 --> 10:22.823
and then sleep in
your clothes.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.359
It's called
a power wake-up.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.962
Warren Buffett does it.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.467
The point is,
maybe there's more
going on here.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.603
Maybe you like like Emily.

10:36.670 --> 10:40.273
Ha! Me like like her?
That's crazy.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.278
Or is it?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.447
It is crazy.

10:47.514 --> 10:50.350
She was standing in sprinklers
for a good 10 minutes!

10:51.752 --> 10:53.220
Not normal!

10:58.926 --> 11:00.260
Hey...

11:03.196 --> 11:05.598
Yep, I told Eric
it was black tie,

11:05.665 --> 11:07.000
but he wanted to do
his own thing.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.268
You said
it was black tie optional.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.204
Everything is technically
optional, Eric.

11:11.271 --> 11:16.109
But most of us opted not
to dress for a damn rodeo!

11:16.176 --> 11:18.278
Look, if you gonna be
on me all night about
my outfit,

11:18.345 --> 11:21.448
I'm gonna find someone
who appreciates me
and my nice jeans.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.050
Well, fine!

11:23.116 --> 11:25.218
And while you're at it,
check the buffet!

11:25.285 --> 11:27.554
I like to know how to
plan my plate, you yokel!

11:29.222 --> 11:30.423
Isn't this fun?

11:31.224 --> 11:32.993
Like, us out
with our guys.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.127
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

11:34.194 --> 11:35.495
It's so much fun.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.697
It's just you, me, Connor,
and the yokel.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.901
What? Is there
something wrong?
Okay, listen.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.669
I'm your friend,
so I'm just gonna
give this to you...

11:42.736 --> 11:44.604
What? No. Yeah,
I'll come to you.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.744
You guys are always fighting.
It's super uncomfortable.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.079
I mean,
Connor is over there

11:52.145 --> 11:53.713
having a conversation
with himself.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.856
Oh, please!
That's just the way we are.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.758
We are just totally honest
with each other.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.159
What, you and Connor
never fight?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.727
Of course not.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.830
So, what do you do
when he does something
that bothers you?

12:09.897 --> 12:11.431
Nothing he does
bothers me.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.237
Okay, occasionally
when he is eating,

12:17.304 --> 12:20.673
he makes this, like,
(MUMBLING) sound.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.846
Kind of makes me okay
with the idea of dying alone.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.583
And you don't say
anything?

12:30.650 --> 12:32.519
And risk having a fight?
No, no.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.354
I just sit there
and take it,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.756
like when you have
a politically incorrect
Uber driver.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.128
Well, every relationship
I ever had,

12:41.194 --> 12:42.729
I got
that kind of stuff out.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.498
I argued from the first day
to the last day,

12:45.565 --> 12:47.734
and sometimes
that's the same day.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.272
I really want it to work
with Eric.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.974
I really want it to work
with Connor.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.675
Well, maybe we should
just trust our instincts.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.310
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.511
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.348
Although, historically,
you and I have spent

13:01.414 --> 13:03.951
many evenings alone
with our instincts.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.155
Ugh!

13:08.221 --> 13:10.958
"Enjoy the comic stylings
of Pat Hein"?

13:11.024 --> 13:13.160
No, thank you.
(SIGHS)

13:13.226 --> 13:15.595
Just try
to enjoy yourself.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.797
Hey, watch it.

13:17.865 --> 13:21.368
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Don't smash my car in.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.903
(LAUGHTER)

13:29.009 --> 13:30.643
Why are there
no trash cans here?

13:38.952 --> 13:40.653
(MID TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS)

13:40.720 --> 13:43.256
Hey. Do you think
we fight too much?

13:43.323 --> 13:44.791
I don't know.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.593
The real question is
why you keep stepping on me

13:46.659 --> 13:48.595
with them big-ass biscuits
you call feet.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.767
Um, thank you, Eric,

13:54.834 --> 13:57.837
for your
constructive criticism.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.839
I will try
to be a better dancer.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.110
You feeling okay?

14:04.377 --> 14:06.279
Never better.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.081
Because you dance
like a drunk ox.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.084
Oh. (CHUCKLING)
You.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.253
You, oh, you are,

14:13.320 --> 14:16.023
oh, you a funny man
with some

14:16.089 --> 14:18.658
nice, appropriate jeans on.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.327
That's what you are.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.365
(MUMBLING)

14:33.573 --> 14:35.175
Hey.

14:35.242 --> 14:39.379
Could I just ask you about
the (MUMBLING) sound?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.681
What are you
talking about?

14:41.748 --> 14:43.383
Just whenever you take a bite
of something,

14:43.450 --> 14:46.019
you just make this...
(ANGRILY) noise.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.422
Which I gather
bothers you.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.292
It is the soundtrack
to my nightmares.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.063
Are you
fighting with me?

14:57.197 --> 14:58.665
I don't know.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.833
Maybe a little.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.270
Okay, all right.
Well, I guess I can tell you
what bothers me.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.471
Like what?

15:04.537 --> 15:06.039
The fact that you tend
to wildly overreact.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.307
(GASPS)

15:14.847 --> 15:16.383
Pat's 15 minutes late.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.085
That's how bad
his comic timing is.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.519
How am I not hosting this?

15:20.720 --> 15:21.888
You know what?
Enough.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.523
Pat's been through
a lot.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.392
I think he took
the Damona thing
pretty hard.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.826
Someone hit his car.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.463
Just be a friend,
okay?

15:30.530 --> 15:32.465
Pat's stranded on the side
of the freeway.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.234
Would you consider...
Yes! Yes, yes,
yes, yes!

15:34.301 --> 15:36.936
(LAUGHING) Oh!
You don't have to
ask me twice.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.538
She didn't even
ask you once.

15:40.540 --> 15:44.611
So, Pat Hein won't be able
to make it tonight.

15:44.677 --> 15:48.015
His bumper somehow fell off
on the 405.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.286
He says he's not
in the greatest of
neighborhoods, but so far,

15:53.353 --> 15:55.922
no one's been able
to jimmy his doors open
and get at him.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.427
Anyway,
here's Dr. Ken Parks!

16:02.595 --> 16:04.197
(WEAK APPLAUSE)

16:08.168 --> 16:09.969
(SIGHS)

16:10.037 --> 16:11.638
You were right, Allison.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.474
Sorry, I can't
be funny right now.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.942
Didn't stop you last year.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.344
(LAUGHTER)

16:24.884 --> 16:26.853
So, guess
who has a girlfriend.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.255
You talked to Emily?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.523
Go, Dave.

16:30.590 --> 16:34.061
So, are you gonna, like,
take her on one
of your learning walks?

16:34.127 --> 16:35.928
No, we're really more
homebodies.

16:36.729 --> 16:37.897
Aah!

16:44.171 --> 16:47.340
Wow, you have a really unique
ability to go unnoticed.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.911
I love that about her.
She's like a superhero.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.049
Aah!
She got in the house?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.417
(KEYS JINGLING)

17:01.121 --> 17:03.123
Grandpa. No.

17:03.190 --> 17:06.993
Every relationship
is different, and if this
works for them...

17:07.060 --> 17:08.161
Okay.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.862
But I'm not
making her a snack.

17:09.929 --> 17:12.132
You feed them,
and they keep coming back.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.985
Well, you're the last person
I expected

17:33.052 --> 17:35.388
to pick me up
on the side of the freeway.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.658
I thought for sure
you'd be up there
hosting in my place.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.992
I was.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.261
The crowd
begged me to stay.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.763
They were chanting my name,
pulling at my clothes.

17:45.232 --> 17:48.368
But I couldn't go through
with it.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.470
I was up there thinking
about you

17:50.537 --> 17:53.706
and your imminent mugging
and your situation.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.509
Whether you believed
it was an accident or not,

17:56.576 --> 17:58.077
it was still my fault.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.580
Well, thanks.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.449
And I'm sorry
I wasn't more gracious

18:02.515 --> 18:04.851
about you being asked
to bomb, I mean host.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.753
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

18:09.156 --> 18:13.193
You know, the car is
a great place for
awkward conversations.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.564
You don't have
to make eye contact.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.400
It's where my dad told me
about the birds and the bees.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.536
And about
his other family.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.707
My point is...

18:29.075 --> 18:30.577
the only reason
the Event Committee

18:30.643 --> 18:33.680
asked me to emcee is...
I made them.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.082
What?
Hmm? Hmm.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.819
Why?

18:39.886 --> 18:44.557
Well, even though Damona
and I are no longer,

18:44.624 --> 18:47.627
I wanted her new beau
to think that her ex was
a somebody.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.264
I took the low road.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.366
Yeah, you wouldn't guess it
to look at me, Ken,

18:53.433 --> 18:56.236
but I can be small
and petty.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.338
(CHUCKLING) Me, too.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.640
Oh, man, I do stuff like
that all the time.

19:00.707 --> 19:01.808
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

19:01.874 --> 19:03.643
Low road's
so much easier.

19:03.710 --> 19:04.977
Oh, yeah.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.414
Oh, if they had a Fast Pass,
I would own it.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.881
(LAUGHS)

19:10.650 --> 19:14.321
Ahh, I wonder who they got
to host the banquet.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.589
Eh, probably pulled some
hack out of the crowd.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.724
(CHUCKLES)

19:21.328 --> 19:25.965
So, I have three children,
11, 17, and 46.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.934
(LAUGHTER)

19:28.000 --> 19:29.969
I'm not saying my husband
is a child.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.404
I don't want to
insult children.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.039
(LAUGHTER)

19:33.105 --> 19:34.707
No, Ken's great.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.609
Just ask him.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.779
What the...

19:39.846 --> 19:41.748
You guys have been
such a great audience.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.416
So much better
than my husband.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.318
(LAUGHTER)

19:45.385 --> 19:47.119
He doesn't even think
I'm funny!

19:47.186 --> 19:48.955
But then again,
he thinks he's funny,

19:49.021 --> 19:50.457
so maybe he's
not the best judge.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.858

19:54.561 --> 19:56.696
Thank you,

Thank you!

19:58.130 --> 19:59.466
(CHEERS)

20:01.834 --> 20:05.572
So, Eric and I didn't fight
for two whole hours.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.507
It was hell.

20:07.574 --> 20:11.778
But we did have
a blowout in the lobby
over some toothpicks.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.447
We're all good now.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.517
Well, we did fight,
and it turns out
we are not good at it.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.453
Yeah, we had no idea
what to do or how
to get out of it.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.356
Finally, I had to agree
to start watching
Stranger Things.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.657
Ugh.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.127
Hey, I gave the valet
our ticket.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.562
Our car
is waiting for us.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.130
Aww.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.532
Brought your raincoat
so you wouldn't have
to wait in line.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.301
Aww.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.369
That's not my raincoat,
genius.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.772
You want to wait longer?
A raincoat is a raincoat.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.011
That's my girl.
Looks good.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.716
That was my coat,
but I'll get another one.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.154
Did you see any of it?
How did I do?

20:55.221 --> 20:56.656
You were so funny.

20:56.723 --> 20:59.826
And not just
book club funny,
HMO banquet funny.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.033
So, you made things right
with Pat?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.234
Yep, we're good.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.636
You're right
about the high road.

21:09.702 --> 21:10.770
It does feel better.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.072
Really? You're
a high road guy now?

21:13.139 --> 21:15.575
Mm, not sure it'll stick,
but let's just enjoy
the moment.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.544
(CHUCKLES)

21:17.610 --> 21:19.912
So, were all your jokes
about me?

21:19.979 --> 21:22.782
Oh, no. Most of them
had nothing to do with you.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.884
Aww.
Thanks for lying.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.253
High road.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.421
(CHUCKLING)
