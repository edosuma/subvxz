A DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA.

07:08.333 --> 07:09.750
THE ORGANS
BELOW THE DIAPHRAGM

07:09.792 --> 07:11.750
ARE PUSHING INTO
HIS THORACIC CAVITY,

07:11.792 --> 07:14.041
AND HE'S HAVING
A HARD TIME BREATHING.
I-I KNOW THIS IS A LOT,

07:14.083 --> 07:16.041
BUT ADDISON NEEDS TO DO
THE SURGERY QUICKLY

07:16.083 --> 07:18.542
TO HELP THE BABY TO BREATHE.
NOW THERE ARE
TWO SURGICAL OPTIONS.

07:18.583 --> 07:20.709
THE FIRST
IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE

07:20.750 --> 07:22.709
AND WILL CORRECT THE PROBLEM
FOR NOW,

07:22.750 --> 07:25.041
BUT AS THE BABY GROWS,
HE'LL REQUIRE MORE SURGERY.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.458
AND THE SECOND IS HIGHER RISK,

07:27.500 --> 07:29.458
BUT IT WILL BE
A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.041
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.
WHAT--WHAT DOES JUDY
WANT TO DO?

07:32.083 --> 07:35.291
UH, WELL, SHE WANTS YOU
TO DECIDE.
THE ADOPTION ISN'T EVEN FINAL.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.500
WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.875
SINCE THE BIRTH MOTHER IS
ABDICATING HER RIGHT TO DECIDE,

07:39.917 --> 07:42.166
THE HOSPITAL WILL HONOR
YOUR WISHES ABOUT WHAT TO DO,

07:42.208 --> 07:44.458
BUT WE NEED A DECISION NOW.
I-I DON'T KNOW.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.500
WELL, WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IS
THE MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH.
BUT HE COULD DIE?

07:47.542 --> 07:50.375
YES.
UM, I CAN'T--I CAN'T DO THIS.

07:50.417 --> 07:53.125
NO, NO, YOU CAN.
JUST TRUST DR. MONTGOMERY.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.333

08:28.208 --> 08:30.917

FOR A LONG TIME.
I'VE HEARD THAT FOR YEARS.

08:30.959 --> 08:32.417

08:32.458 --> 08:35.041

N-NORA, I-I HAVE TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.667

IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

08:54.709 --> 08:56.041

08:56.083 --> 08:58.959

08:59.000 --> 09:01.125
THIS COULD BE GOOD.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.750

'CAUSE YOU'RE OUT IN THE WORLD,

09:03.792 --> 09:05.750
BUT YOU'RE IN HERE,
SAFE, SECURE.

09:05.792 --> 09:09.000
YOU CAN PRACTICE YOUR BREATHING,
YOUR VISUALIZATIONS.

09:09.041 --> 09:11.000
I CAN'T.

09:11.041 --> 09:14.000

09:39.500 --> 09:41.000

09:41.041 --> 09:43.250
BUT THE CHANCE TO CONTROL
WHEN AND HOW THE END COMES.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.250
THIS IS--IT'S MERCY,
NOT MURDER.

09:45.291 --> 09:47.041
LETTING NATURE RUN ITS COURSE

09:47.083 --> 09:49.291
IS DIFFERENT
THAN HELPING NATURE ALONG.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.959

A PRESCRIPTION

09:55.000 --> 09:56.500
AND BUYING HIM A GUN.

09:56.542 --> 09:59.333
I WON'T DO IT.
THE PRACTICE WON'T ALLOW IT.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.500
THE SINCLAIRS--
THEY'RE PROBABLY

10:01.542 --> 10:03.500
NOT GONNA GO THROUGH
WITH THE ADOPTION.

10:03.542 --> 10:06.333
W-WHAT? BECAUSE HE'S SICK?

10:06.375 --> 10:09.041
LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THEM
RIGHT NOW. HE NEEDS SURGERY.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.959
AND WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT,

10:11.000 --> 10:12.959
THE HOSPITAL WON'T ALLOW
DR. MONTGOMERY TO DO

10:13.000 --> 10:16.208
WHAT SHE THINKS
IS BEST FOR HIM.
SHE TOLD ME BEFORE
I HAD TO CHOOSE.

10:16.250 --> 10:19.041
I DON'T THINK I CAN CHOOSE
AND THEN LET GO.
I THINK YOU'VE BEEN CHOOSING

10:19.083 --> 10:21.250
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE BABY
ALL ALONG.

10:21.291 --> 10:24.000
HE NEEDS YOU,
ONE LAST TIME.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.667
PAPER'S SIGNED.
YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

10:32.709 --> 10:34.583
JUDY CAME THROUGH.
YEAH, FOR NOW.

10:34.625 --> 10:37.125
I'M STILL HOPING THAT
THE SINCLAIRS WILL COME THROUGH.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.125
THEY WALKED IN A CRISIS.

10:39.166 --> 10:41.125
WOULD YOU WANT THAT
FOR YOUR KID?

10:41.166 --> 10:44.000
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
LIKE WHO YOU'RE DATING?

10:44.041 --> 10:46.000
THE COLLEAGUE YOU REFUSE
TO TELL ME ABOUT?

10:46.041 --> 10:48.041
WELL, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.
WHAT ABOUT WYATT?

10:48.083 --> 10:50.041
WHY IS EVERYONE SO STUCK

10:50.083 --> 10:53.333
ON WHAT DID OR DIDN'T HAPPEN
WITH WYATT?
WELL, WHO ELSE
IS STUCK ON IT?

10:53.375 --> 10:56.083
YOU DIDN'T TELL KEVIN?
NO. THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

10:56.125 --> 10:59.083
I DIDN'T CHEAT.
I DIDN'T GO OUT ON THE DATE.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.959
I JUST WENT INTO HIS OFFICE
AND KISSED HIM.
PARDON ME?

11:02.000 --> 11:05.041
AND THEN I WALKED OUT. SO
TECHNICALLY, IT WASN'T CHEATING.

11:05.083 --> 11:08.166
TECHNICALLY, YOU WALKED INTO HIS
OFFICE AND YOU KISSED HIM AND--

11:08.208 --> 11:10.917
AND STOPPED AND I LEFT,
AND I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE.

11:10.959 --> 11:13.917
KEVIN KEEPS ASKING WHERE I WAS,
AND I KEEP TELLING HIM

11:13.959 --> 11:16.125
I WAS WORKING
AND I DIVERT HIM WITH SEX.

11:16.166 --> 11:18.125
BUT IT WAS NOTHING.
WELL, IF IT WAS NOTHING,

11:18.166 --> 11:20.125
THEN DID YOU WAIT A WEEK
TO TELL ME?

11:20.166 --> 11:22.709
(monitor beeping erratically)

11:22.750 --> 11:24.083
(water running)

11:24.125 --> 11:25.959
BABY'S SATs ARE FALLING.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
OKAY, TAKE HIM OFF THE VENT
AND BAG HIM.

11:28.041 --> 11:29.667
I GOTTA GO IN NOW.

11:29.709 --> 11:33.000
NORA, I'M SO SORRY.
I WAS JUST...

11:35.166 --> 11:38.041
NORA?

11:38.083 --> 11:40.166
HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR MOTHER?

11:40.208 --> 11:42.166
SHE'S NOT IN YOUR OFFICE?

11:42.208 --> 11:44.083
MAYBE SHE'S
IN THE BATHROOM.

12:20.750 --> 12:22.875
NORA...

12:22.917 --> 12:26.041
ARE YOU IN THERE?

12:26.083 --> 12:27.917
YES.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.667
DO YOU WANT
TO COME OUT?

12:32.709 --> 12:34.625
NO.

12:40.375 --> 12:42.500

13:02.583 --> 13:05.500
WE CAN'T PRESCRIBE DRUGS

13:05.542 --> 13:07.500

I WASN'T COUNTING ON IT.

THE PAIN, AND YOU HAVE TIME.

13:25.709 --> 13:29.458

NO, DON'T BOTHER. IT'S OKAY.

I'M GONNA DIE.

STOP THINKING ABOUT HIM.

22:21.583 --> 22:24.041
(exhales and groans)

22:24.083 --> 22:26.917
I HATE SEEING YOU
LIKE THIS.

22:26.959 --> 22:28.750
IT'S NOT MY FAVORITE THING,
EITHER.

22:28.792 --> 22:31.625
IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT TO DIE.

22:31.667 --> 22:35.959
IF I COULD LIVE...
LIKE I LIVED WHEN I LIVED...

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
AND I LIVED,
LET ME TELL YOU.

22:45.041 --> 22:49.041
I THOUGHT ONCE
I MIGHT FALL IN LOVE.

22:49.083 --> 22:52.000
I HAD LOTS OF SEX.

22:52.041 --> 22:53.417
(mouths words)

22:53.458 --> 22:55.041
(laughs)

22:55.083 --> 22:58.875
I GUESS I WAS JUST FAR TOO
GOOD-LOOKING FOR MY OWN GOOD.

22:58.917 --> 23:01.291
YOU AND NAOMI SPLIT.

23:01.333 --> 23:03.208
YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND NOW?

23:03.250 --> 23:05.625
UH, KINDA.

23:05.667 --> 23:08.208
YOU LIKE HER?
A LOT.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.041
HOW'S THE SEX?

23:10.083 --> 23:12.041
(laughs)

23:12.083 --> 23:14.917
I'M A DYING MAN.
INDULGE ME.

23:14.959 --> 23:16.083
UH, WE ACTUALLY--

23:16.125 --> 23:18.875
WE HAVEN'T REACHED THAT LEVEL
YET. (clears throat)

23:18.917 --> 23:21.417
TAKING IT SLOW.

23:21.458 --> 23:23.875
I SUPPOSE THAT'S
THE WAY YOU FIND LOVE.

23:23.917 --> 23:27.834
JUST DON'T END UP
LIKE ME, SAM.

23:27.875 --> 23:30.083
IT'S NOT THAT GOOD
TO DIE ALONE.

23:30.125 --> 23:32.458
(grunts)

23:32.500 --> 23:34.083
OH!

23:34.125 --> 23:36.625
(groans)

23:36.667 --> 23:38.667
(crying) OH!

23:38.709 --> 23:40.041
ALL RIGHT.

23:40.083 --> 23:41.250
OH.

23:43.792 --> 23:45.750
I'M GONNA GO FOR A WALK.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.125
OH.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.834
OH.

23:50.875 --> 23:53.875
(knock on door)

23:53.917 --> 23:56.041
WE BROUGHT SOME THINGS
FOR THE BABY.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.917
SHE'S NOT
CHANGING HER MIND.
DELL.

23:58.959 --> 24:02.041
NO, IT'S--IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE ANGRY.

24:02.083 --> 24:04.041
THEY WEREN'T
TO CHANGE JUDY'S MIND.

24:04.083 --> 24:07.041
THEY WERE THINGS WE BOUGHT
THAT WE WANTED HIM TO HAVE.

24:07.083 --> 24:10.166
HE SHOULD STILL HAVE THEM.
WELL, WE'LL PASS 'EM ON.

24:16.333 --> 24:18.000
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

24:18.041 --> 24:20.166
WE KNOW HOW BADLY
WE SCREWED UP.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.959
AFTER THE MISCARRIAGES

24:22.000 --> 24:23.792
AND THE ADOPTIONS
THAT FELL APART,

24:23.834 --> 24:26.291
WE FELT LIKE
WE LOST THOSE BABIES.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.291
THE THOUGHT OF THIS BABY...

24:28.333 --> 24:31.041
(voice breaking) WE WERE
AFRAID OF NOT HAVING HIM.

24:31.083 --> 24:33.166
AND NOW WE DON'T HAVE HIM.

24:33.208 --> 24:35.166
WE'VE LOST ANOTHER CHILD...

24:35.208 --> 24:39.083
AND IT'S OUR OWN FAULT.

25:05.875 --> 25:07.041
TINA.

25:07.083 --> 25:09.834
SHE WON'T
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

25:09.875 --> 25:12.583
I CAN'T GET MARRIED
WITHOUT HER THERE.

25:12.625 --> 25:16.000
I WON'T. PLEASE.

25:16.041 --> 25:18.041
DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S GONNA BE THERE.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.834
JUST GO.

25:30.792 --> 25:34.792
SO YOU GOT HERE.

25:34.834 --> 25:38.542
THAT'S A HUGE STEP.

25:38.583 --> 25:40.792
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
I'M A FAILURE.

25:40.834 --> 25:43.291
I USED TO THINK
I WAS A GOOD MOTHER.

25:46.834 --> 25:49.417
NOW SHE'D BE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT ME.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.667
(fusses)

25:53.709 --> 25:55.667
JUDY.

25:55.709 --> 25:57.417
DID, UH...

25:57.458 --> 26:00.041
DID DELL TELL YOU
THAT THE SINCLAIRS CAME BY

26:00.083 --> 26:02.375
WITH SOME THINGS
FOR THE BABY?

26:02.417 --> 26:05.625
YEAH, BUT THEY BAILED,
SO THERE'S NO MORE--
DELL, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?

26:05.667 --> 26:07.917
MM-HMM.
EXCUSE US.

26:10.917 --> 26:14.458
YOU'RE PUSHING JUDY TO DO
WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT.
IT IS RIGHT.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.500
YOU NEED TO LISTEN.
IF YOU'D LISTENED,

26:16.542 --> 26:18.875
YOU WOULD'VE HEARD
HOW SCARED THE SINCLAIRS WERE.
NO, I HEARD.

26:18.917 --> 26:22.709
NO, DELL, YOU WALKED OUT.
CAN'T YOU SEE SHE'S TERRIFIED?

26:22.750 --> 26:24.208
LISTEN TO HER, DELL.

26:24.250 --> 26:27.041
ISN'T THAT WHAT SHE'S BEEN
TELLING YOU ALL ALONG?

26:27.083 --> 26:29.250
YOU DON'T THINK
I SHOULD KEEP HIM?

26:29.291 --> 26:31.709
UH, THAT'S NOT MINE TO SAY.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.709
IF YOU KNOW
THAT THIS IS RIGHT,

26:33.750 --> 26:35.709
KEEPING THE BABY,
THEN IT IS.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.917
IT'S RIGHT, PERIOD.
YOU JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE

26:37.959 --> 26:40.041
THAT YOU'RE DOING IT
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS, JUDY.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.959
NOT BECAUSE YOU THINK
YOU HAVE TO

26:42.000 --> 26:44.333
OR BECAUSE YOU THINK
THAT OTHERS THINK YOU SHOULD,

26:44.375 --> 26:47.000
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO.

26:53.083 --> 26:56.417
WHEN MY HUSBAND
WALKED OUT...

26:56.458 --> 26:59.041
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

26:59.083 --> 27:03.959
I KEPT THINKING THAT HE WAS
GOING TO COME HOME.

27:06.709 --> 27:10.667
I WOULDN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE
IN CASE HE CAME BACK.

27:10.709 --> 27:12.041
I HAD TO BE THERE.

27:12.083 --> 27:14.125
SO YOU GOT STUCK,
BECAUSE IN SOME WAYS,

27:14.166 --> 27:16.333
YOU COULDN'T LET GO
OF THAT IDEA,

27:16.375 --> 27:18.959
THAT HE'D WALK THROUGH
THAT DOOR.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.792
I'D KILL HIM IF HE DID.
HE DID THIS TO ME.

27:21.834 --> 27:24.041
NO, HE DIDN'T.

27:24.083 --> 27:26.041
YOU'RE DOING THIS
TO YOURSELF--

27:26.083 --> 27:28.083
PUNISHING YOURSELF
OR DEPRIVING YOURSELF.

27:28.125 --> 27:32.041
HE WENT OUT
AND GOT A LIFE.

27:32.083 --> 27:34.709
AND YOUR DAUGHTER'S DOING
THE SAME THING TODAY.

27:34.750 --> 27:38.083
AND I KNOW
HOW HARD IT MUST BE FOR YOU

27:38.125 --> 27:40.500
THAT SHE'S WALKING OUT, TOO.

27:40.542 --> 27:42.917
BUT SITTING IN THIS CAR
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

27:42.959 --> 27:45.041
THAT SHE IS GETTING MARRIED.

27:45.083 --> 27:47.792
SO YOU WANT TO BECOME
A PART OF IT

27:47.834 --> 27:49.792
OR STAY ALONE?

27:49.834 --> 27:52.208
SO... MAYBE YOUR LIFE
DIDN'T TURN OUT

27:52.250 --> 27:54.166
THE WAY
YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD.

27:54.208 --> 27:57.041
YOU CAN EMBRACE THIS.

27:57.083 --> 27:58.959
CREATE THE NEXT STEP,

27:59.000 --> 28:02.792
STARTING TODAY.

28:02.834 --> 28:06.875
WHY ARE YOU AFRAID
OF BEING PREGNANT?

28:09.750 --> 28:12.000
I AM...

28:12.041 --> 28:13.875
AFRAID THAT I'LL FAIL.

28:13.917 --> 28:17.041
(voice breaking)
I'M AFRAID...

28:17.083 --> 28:20.667
THAT I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

28:20.709 --> 28:23.000
I'M JUST AFRAID.

28:27.625 --> 28:31.000
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT
PARALYZE ME.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.834
HELP ME.

28:35.875 --> 28:37.959
HELP ME DO THIS.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.250
HOW DO I DO THIS?

28:46.125 --> 28:48.458
YOU WERE GONE FOR A WHILE.

28:53.917 --> 28:55.166
PETE...

28:55.208 --> 28:57.750
IT'LL TAKE AWAY
THE PAIN.

28:59.083 --> 29:02.041
YOU STOLE MORPHINE SO YOU COULD
EUTHANIZE A PATIENT?

29:02.083 --> 29:03.583
I'M A DOCTOR, SAM.

29:03.625 --> 29:06.458

29:06.500 --> 29:09.041

TO STAY HEALTHY.

29:09.083 --> 29:11.291
AND I'M NOT DOING
ANY OF THAT.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.875
I NEED TO HELP HIM.

29:13.917 --> 29:17.959

29:38.083 --> 29:41.417
PETE AND I ARE GOING TO SIT,

29:41.458 --> 29:43.917

29:48.458 --> 29:50.917

29:56.375 --> 29:58.917
I-IS IT ENOUGH?
