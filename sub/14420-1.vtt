01:03.459 --> 01:05.042
There was a man.

01:08.376 --> 01:14.334
He came out of nowhere
and pushed our society into chaos.

01:14.751 --> 01:15.751
He was...

01:16.876 --> 01:17.876
Hello.

01:18.167 --> 01:20.376
My name is Gu, Park Gu.

01:20.376 --> 01:22.459
Could you...sit down?

01:23.042 --> 01:23.751
What?

01:24.167 --> 01:25.209
On the chair.

01:27.501 --> 01:30.459
Right, I'm sorry.

01:40.501 --> 01:41.292
Go on.

01:43.584 --> 01:44.501
Um...

01:46.084 --> 01:47.376
Start?

01:47.792 --> 01:49.126
A mutant.

01:51.251 --> 01:52.084
Make way!

01:56.834 --> 01:59.917
It's been 5 years, since he was last seen,

02:00.542 --> 02:02.584
and we still don't know much about him.

02:02.584 --> 02:04.709
"Revolutionary Evolution,
or Scientific Curse?"

02:06.709 --> 02:09.042
To some, he was a hero,

02:10.709 --> 02:13.876
to others, he was a con man.

02:15.376 --> 02:17.251
He was someone's friend,

02:19.459 --> 02:21.334
someone's celebrity,

02:23.959 --> 02:25.376
someone's god...

02:25.376 --> 02:27.584
Wipe out commies!

02:27.584 --> 02:30.959
And someone's devil.

02:33.542 --> 02:34.917
He made us laugh

02:36.084 --> 02:37.459
and cry.

02:39.667 --> 02:40.876
The story of a man,

02:42.042 --> 02:44.126
who was also a fish...

02:45.834 --> 02:47.251
begins here.

02:47.459 --> 02:52.084
@

02:59.042 --> 03:00.834
That stupid idiot...

03:01.417 --> 03:03.084
See this?

03:03.084 --> 03:04.251
"No smoking"

03:04.251 --> 03:07.709
I'm fed up telling you
not to smoke while editing!

03:09.251 --> 03:12.042
Still not over this shit?

03:13.334 --> 03:15.584
Is the sting ray diner segment done?

03:15.584 --> 03:18.376
What's there to edit? It's a diner.

03:18.959 --> 03:21.209
Cut some reaction shots together.

03:21.209 --> 03:23.334
Watch what you're saying.

03:23.417 --> 03:27.209
Buddy, even making
one cut requires philosophy!

03:27.209 --> 03:29.792
I was there, the uptown joint.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.626
They taste like shit, know that?

03:31.626 --> 03:34.917
Look, we're pro all here, don't be a baby.

03:34.917 --> 03:37.167
How much bribe have you taken, dammit!

03:37.167 --> 03:39.334
Was it me alone? Really?

03:39.334 --> 03:43.084
Company dinners, extra cash,
they all came from somewhere!

03:46.584 --> 03:47.459
Sang-won.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.167
I'm looking out for your own good,

03:50.917 --> 03:52.417
please stop watching this.

03:53.792 --> 03:57.584
Aside from you, no one cares about him!

04:01.084 --> 04:02.167
Are you done?

04:03.626 --> 04:05.376
You got a guest, asshole!

04:11.501 --> 04:12.626
Jin?

04:14.751 --> 04:16.166
Been a while.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.166
You're a big shot now, saw you on TV.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.167
You left something out, didn't you?

04:28.126 --> 04:28.959
What?

04:35.209 --> 04:36.876
You didn't know?

04:37.209 --> 04:39.251
What is this? So random.

04:40.126 --> 04:42.751
Do you still work on it? The documentary?

04:44.292 --> 04:45.751
It's all over...

04:46.417 --> 04:48.167
Too busy making ends meet.

04:48.751 --> 04:49.792
Bullshit.

04:53.126 --> 04:53.917
Or not?

05:01.417 --> 05:02.126
Got a light?

05:08.126 --> 05:09.667
Don't give up.

05:10.792 --> 05:14.584
It'd be a shame, you're his last hope.

05:24.667 --> 05:28.709
I first met Jin 5 years ago.

05:28.751 --> 05:32.042
"5 years ago, ABS Station"

05:32.042 --> 05:37.667
I wish to represent the people
and uncover the truth,

05:38.917 --> 05:41.709
report the injustice in our society...

05:42.792 --> 05:45.709
Report the injustice in our society,

05:46.834 --> 05:48.584
protect the weak,

05:50.334 --> 05:52.459
and become a...

05:59.126 --> 05:59.959
"CV"

06:00.792 --> 06:04.417
I...really want to be a real reporter.

06:05.459 --> 06:06.292
Why?

06:08.084 --> 06:10.501
I wish to represent the people
and uncover the truth,

06:10.501 --> 06:12.751
report the injustice in our society...

06:12.959 --> 06:14.376
Community college?

06:17.667 --> 06:18.376
Yes.

06:25.126 --> 06:26.167
Any skills?

06:27.251 --> 06:30.334
I can do everything well,
if you give me a chance.

06:30.334 --> 06:32.459
Can you get us an interview?

06:33.584 --> 06:34.542
Pardon?

06:36.501 --> 06:37.917
Not a hard assignment.

06:41.209 --> 06:44.751
So am I hired?

06:45.626 --> 06:46.376
No.

06:50.334 --> 06:52.292
We came upon a strange girl.

06:52.542 --> 06:53.667
"Full Account of the Fish Man"

06:53.667 --> 06:55.959
She claims her boyfriend turned into a fish.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.251
Messed up, right?

06:58.251 --> 07:00.751
"TITLE: Shit! Fish Man is REAL!"

07:00.959 --> 07:06.209
There's a big flame war online,
debating the veracity of the story.

07:09.709 --> 07:13.417
But she won't ever back down,
she's a prickly one.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.334
Go and get her interview.

07:20.459 --> 07:24.251
It'd be good if you find out
why she's making stuff up.

07:26.042 --> 07:29.959
You're not hired yet, so no mention of ABS.

07:30.542 --> 07:32.001
Don't go too deep.

07:33.959 --> 07:36.251
Because of the strike here,

07:36.917 --> 07:39.167
I got no one to assign this to.

07:40.251 --> 07:44.167
Let's see how you work, then I'll decide.

07:44.751 --> 07:47.209
Do your best.

08:02.001 --> 08:03.667
"Fucking bitch"

08:03.667 --> 08:05.292
"Liar"

08:12.209 --> 08:13.334
Anyone home?

08:14.542 --> 08:16.876
Is Ms. Violent Monster here?

08:20.709 --> 08:23.792
Violent Monster! Are you in?

08:38.626 --> 08:39.751
Who are you?

08:51.376 --> 08:53.667
Clinical trial?

08:54.042 --> 08:58.084
Yeah, $300 in 2 days for taking a pill.

08:58.084 --> 09:01.542
$300? That much?

09:01.834 --> 09:02.667
Yeah.

09:03.001 --> 09:06.584
My body felt weird a day into it.

09:10.084 --> 09:14.334
Then they did weird tests, but I escaped.

09:18.959 --> 09:19.959
So what?

09:20.292 --> 09:23.167
You can't show up out of the blue.

09:23.292 --> 09:27.001
You may've misunderstood our relationship.

09:27.792 --> 09:28.917
That night...

09:29.292 --> 09:33.167
we were both drunk.

09:33.167 --> 09:35.084
I got nowhere to go.

09:35.251 --> 09:36.084
What?

09:36.292 --> 09:38.376
They know where I live.

09:40.001 --> 09:40.834
Those bastards.

09:47.459 --> 09:50.667
"Ganmi Medical Hotline 031-521-1865"

09:59.084 --> 10:01.876
Do you want...

10:02.584 --> 10:03.667
more tea?

10:13.834 --> 10:15.001
Your room...

10:16.334 --> 10:17.792
is really nice.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.042
I was too drunk to notice it before.

10:22.251 --> 10:23.584
Girl rooms are nice.

10:24.751 --> 10:27.167
This is Ganmi Medical.

10:27.167 --> 10:29.792
- You got an escape...
- To inquire about...

10:29.792 --> 10:32.042
- Hello? Hello?
- Press 2 for product info...

10:32.959 --> 10:34.584
I wanted to...

10:35.792 --> 10:37.501
Press 4 for recruitment...

10:37.501 --> 10:40.459
- Press 5 for A/S
- Ask you about something.

10:40.876 --> 10:43.334
Press 6 for public relations,
press 7 for manufacturing...

10:45.001 --> 10:46.917
- Are you listening?
- What?

10:46.917 --> 10:49.459
Press 8 for research programs.

10:49.459 --> 10:51.001
Yeah, of course.

10:53.251 --> 10:54.626
The thing about us...

10:54.834 --> 10:58.042
- Press 0 for an operator.
- Operator!

10:58.959 --> 11:00.209
What...

11:00.667 --> 11:01.792
This is Ganmi Medical.

11:01.792 --> 11:03.417
How much will you pay...

11:04.501 --> 11:05.376
Are we?

11:05.709 --> 11:08.501
To have your escapee back?

11:09.959 --> 11:10.959
Say what?

11:11.292 --> 11:12.542
I sold him.

11:12.542 --> 11:14.167
That cheap bastard.

11:15.584 --> 11:19.459
You said you two were an item.

11:20.667 --> 11:21.584
So what?

11:21.584 --> 11:23.751
Why can't I? It's a capitalistic society.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.792
And we weren't really dating.

11:27.959 --> 11:28.709
Then?

11:28.917 --> 11:31.917
A one-night stand.

11:32.417 --> 11:33.501
One-night stand?

11:34.584 --> 11:35.834
The thing is,

11:35.834 --> 11:38.834
I met him when I worked as an extra,

11:38.834 --> 11:40.584
I was Palace Maid 3.

11:40.834 --> 11:44.584
And Eunuch was really coming onto me.

11:44.584 --> 11:46.042
I was really popular on the set.

11:46.209 --> 11:47.834
But I didn't really like him.

11:48.001 --> 11:49.959
He felt so phony.

11:50.209 --> 11:53.542
Always hitting on me, asking me to go drinking.

11:53.542 --> 11:56.751
He was so persistent, so I set up a date.

11:56.751 --> 11:57.709
To screw him over.

11:57.709 --> 12:00.626
So I took other maids with me.

12:00.834 --> 12:05.126
Then he took us all to a super fancy place.

12:05.126 --> 12:06.917
He went overboard.

12:07.459 --> 12:10.209
But I thought he was a bit cute,

12:10.209 --> 12:14.626
thinking that he really liked me,

12:15.126 --> 12:16.459
and I was a bit drunk.

12:17.709 --> 12:21.209
So we hooked up.

12:21.209 --> 12:22.709
- With the Eunuch?
- Yes.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.251
Is that wrong? We're all young.

12:26.667 --> 12:29.667
Of course, nothing wrong.

12:30.042 --> 12:34.917
So how did the Eunuch become the fish man?

12:34.917 --> 12:36.834
No, he was the Horse.

12:36.834 --> 12:37.459
What?

12:37.459 --> 12:39.751
He played the Horse.

12:39.751 --> 12:41.751
- It's not a real horse?
- No! You didn't know?

12:41.751 --> 12:42.584
But how?

12:42.584 --> 12:46.751
Anyway! Gossip went around the following day,

12:46.751 --> 12:49.584
the Eunuch got in a fight with the Prince.

12:50.126 --> 12:53.084
I was actually dating the Prince at the time.

12:53.084 --> 12:54.376
- The Prince?
- Yes.

12:54.501 --> 12:55.584
But the Eunuch...

12:55.584 --> 12:57.001
I was really popular!

12:57.501 --> 13:00.417
- Right.
- Anyway, during the fight,

13:00.417 --> 13:02.417
the Prince got hurt.

13:02.709 --> 13:06.376
So it became a big deal,
cause he couldn't work.

13:06.501 --> 13:09.209
You know what's funny?

13:09.334 --> 13:12.251
The boss called me the next day,

13:12.376 --> 13:15.334
and asked me to quit the job!

13:15.626 --> 13:18.709
That's the problem with Korea!

13:18.834 --> 13:20.042
Patriarchy!

13:21.292 --> 13:22.501
Turns out,

13:22.501 --> 13:27.376
that Maid 4 bitch bad-mouthed me.

13:27.751 --> 13:30.459
We are our worst enemy!

13:33.709 --> 13:36.084
"Maid 4 is a bitch!"

13:38.626 --> 13:42.501
Okay, I'm really confused right now.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.876
So when you were Maid 3,

13:44.876 --> 13:48.501
you were dating the Prince,
and slept with the Eunuch,

13:48.501 --> 13:51.376
and also with...

13:51.917 --> 13:53.834
the Horse, but...

13:53.834 --> 13:54.709
he became a fish...

13:54.709 --> 13:56.042
You don't believe me, right?

13:57.626 --> 14:00.626
How can I? Nothing makes sense.

14:03.292 --> 14:06.251
I can overlook other details,

14:06.376 --> 14:07.709
but how can a man become a fish?

14:07.709 --> 14:08.584
Let's do it this way!

14:10.084 --> 14:11.667
- What way?
- Come with me.

14:12.459 --> 14:13.084
Where?

14:13.126 --> 14:14.501
I'll show you!

14:15.417 --> 14:16.542
The fish man.

14:21.751 --> 14:24.376
"Ganmi Medical"

14:28.251 --> 14:29.292
Chinese delivery.

14:31.417 --> 14:33.251
- Which room?
- What?

14:34.001 --> 14:35.542
Delivery for which room?

14:36.792 --> 14:37.917
It's...

14:38.209 --> 14:40.126
- 201
- 201?

14:42.834 --> 14:45.751
- PR?
- Yeah, that's it.

14:47.501 --> 14:48.584
This way.

14:53.376 --> 14:56.042
Why did they order so much food?

14:57.084 --> 14:59.251
- Well, um...
- I know.

14:59.834 --> 15:02.209
My arms are numb.

15:04.126 --> 15:07.251
Return it on your way out,
and get the dishes quickly.

15:07.834 --> 15:08.917
Of course!

15:12.501 --> 15:13.584
One second.

15:15.167 --> 15:16.334
Buddy boy.

15:17.292 --> 15:20.334
Are you sick? You look pale.

15:20.334 --> 15:21.376
No...no...

15:22.834 --> 15:24.042
He's just weak.

15:25.584 --> 15:29.001
Are you an idiot? We almost got caught!

15:29.001 --> 15:31.459
What? I was so natural.

15:31.834 --> 15:33.542
Don't even open your mouth.

15:39.751 --> 15:40.626
Delivery!

15:41.334 --> 15:42.167
Did someone order?

15:44.626 --> 15:45.584
I'm sorry.

15:51.751 --> 15:52.626
"Research Development"

15:52.626 --> 15:53.917
Research...

15:55.209 --> 15:56.042
Okay!

16:04.542 --> 16:05.876
Please try again

16:10.001 --> 16:11.542
Please try again

16:11.792 --> 16:13.001
It's not working!

16:15.167 --> 16:15.917
Should we leave?

16:16.167 --> 16:19.501
Are you nuts? We came so far!

16:21.376 --> 16:25.292
Are you sure he's in there? Are you really?

16:26.001 --> 16:28.334
If we don't find him, this won't end well!

16:34.667 --> 16:38.084
- You're doing it, right?
- Just hold still!

16:38.084 --> 16:40.167
Stop moving around so much!

16:40.334 --> 16:42.042
Why is it taking so long?

16:57.167 --> 17:01.001
Fire detected, this is not a drill.

17:01.751 --> 17:05.376
Fire detected, this is not a drill.

17:06.291 --> 17:12.041
Please exit the building in orderly fashion.

17:12.876 --> 17:18.626
Please exit the building in orderly fashion.

17:30.376 --> 17:33.251
See? There's nothing here.

17:34.209 --> 17:35.626
Let's just leave.

17:35.834 --> 17:36.917
Come on!

17:41.251 --> 17:42.251
Help...

17:42.917 --> 17:43.751
Wait a moment.

17:43.876 --> 17:46.959
Help...

17:53.709 --> 17:55.417
Who are you?

17:55.751 --> 17:58.542
Bastards...You're intruders!

17:59.334 --> 18:00.209
That's...

18:01.376 --> 18:02.709
Holy shit!

18:08.792 --> 18:13.917
Walking Dead, Cutie87, do you see? Shitheads!

18:14.376 --> 18:17.126
It's an unbelievable revelation.

18:17.126 --> 18:20.167
A young man who participated in
a clinical trial for a new drug

18:20.167 --> 18:21.917
has become a fish.

18:21.917 --> 18:26.667
Ganmi Medical imprisoned him,
and continued their experiments.

18:27.042 --> 18:31.542
We have the exclusive story of
this harsh violation of human rights.

18:31.959 --> 18:34.959
Intimidating medical supplies and drugs.

18:35.084 --> 18:38.251
Secret room behind curtains.

18:38.376 --> 18:41.584
Images of human experiments in Auschwitz

18:41.584 --> 18:43.917
are conjured up.

18:43.917 --> 18:46.292
The victim's 4 limbs were tied up,

18:46.292 --> 18:51.459
and was forced to participate in
terrifying experiments.

18:51.667 --> 18:54.084
He couldn't be anesthetized.

18:54.084 --> 18:57.584
We had to find out how far
the nerves were connected.

18:57.584 --> 19:01.042
It was hard for us! We're humans too.

19:01.209 --> 19:04.292
Under the pretense of medical advancement,

19:04.334 --> 19:06.834
human rights were violated,

19:06.834 --> 19:08.917
ABS' Kim Gwang-bin reporting.

19:14.167 --> 19:20.376
Do you know why people call me 'Ghost Eyes'?

19:20.626 --> 19:22.001
No.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.959
I recognize amazing talent.

19:25.292 --> 19:25.876
Here!

19:25.876 --> 19:26.834
"ABS Reporter Seo Sang-won"

19:26.834 --> 19:29.709
You'll be a full-timer soon.
A temp spot for now.

19:30.501 --> 19:31.834
Thank you!

19:32.626 --> 19:34.417
I'll do my best!

19:35.126 --> 19:36.542
It'll be an important period.

19:36.542 --> 19:40.751
Once the strike ends, not everyone will return.

19:41.667 --> 19:44.334
They're more qualified, right?

19:46.876 --> 19:48.126
Right.

19:48.542 --> 19:52.542
You got a lot of catching up,
work faster and harder.

19:52.542 --> 19:53.834
Understand?

19:54.209 --> 19:55.292
Yes.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.167
Listen.

20:11.917 --> 20:15.459
It's your job to find everything
about the fish man.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.084
Okay.

20:17.209 --> 20:19.876
Does anyone know you're an ABS reporter?

20:19.876 --> 20:22.126
No, you said not to tell.

20:22.209 --> 20:25.376
Then keep it that way,
let's not kick up a storm.

20:25.584 --> 20:26.959
Where is he now?

20:27.459 --> 20:28.834
Pardon?

20:29.251 --> 20:31.376
The fish man. Where is he?

20:32.417 --> 20:35.042
- My home...
- Your home?

20:36.292 --> 20:38.251
He had nowhere else to go...

20:40.292 --> 20:42.042
Good boy.

20:42.751 --> 20:45.251
This is your chance, seize it!

20:57.459 --> 20:59.542
"Video Album"

21:12.667 --> 21:15.251
Park Gu, 29 years old.

21:16.084 --> 21:19.834
Raised by a salary man father
and a housewife mother,

21:20.709 --> 21:22.876
he had a normal childhood.

21:22.876 --> 21:25.542
"Be healthy"

21:25.542 --> 21:28.917
Normal height, normal physique,

21:29.084 --> 21:32.334
normal face, normal personality.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.792
I don't remember that name.

21:35.001 --> 21:37.792
I was class rep,

21:37.792 --> 21:40.584
so I know everyone in the class.

21:40.584 --> 21:41.376
"Park Gu"

21:41.376 --> 21:43.584
He does look a bit familiar...

21:44.459 --> 21:47.042
My memory is usually good.

21:47.042 --> 21:49.001
I was the class rep too.

21:49.584 --> 21:52.251
Have I mentioned I was the class rep?

21:52.251 --> 21:53.876
"Dormitory"
Being so ordinary,

21:54.251 --> 21:56.876
he never got a job after college,

21:56.876 --> 22:00.042
and on his father's advice,

22:00.042 --> 22:02.792
he began prepping for civil exam.

22:06.001 --> 22:08.709
Do you remember anything

22:08.709 --> 22:11.084
on the clinical trial release form?

22:11.084 --> 22:13.292
Something about Omega 3,

22:13.792 --> 22:17.001
something was written about Omega 3 for sure.

22:17.334 --> 22:19.251
I didn't read it properly.

22:19.626 --> 22:22.626
Why did you participate in a clinical trial,

22:23.126 --> 22:24.917
without reading the fine prints?

22:26.001 --> 22:27.084
I'm sorry...

22:27.292 --> 22:30.167
No, no need to be apologize.

22:34.751 --> 22:35.667
Father!

22:35.792 --> 22:36.584
"Father"?

22:36.584 --> 22:38.042
Father, I...

22:38.042 --> 22:38.917
Father! Wait!

22:38.917 --> 22:40.584
Father! Please!

22:43.126 --> 22:44.292
Dang.

22:48.334 --> 22:49.917
Documentary?

22:50.001 --> 22:51.292
Yes.

22:51.876 --> 22:53.251
It's a documentary.

22:56.209 --> 23:00.417
It could be used when you choose to sue...

23:00.417 --> 23:01.209
Buddy.

23:01.542 --> 23:02.417
Sir?

23:03.292 --> 23:06.417
Don't get any funny ideas.

23:08.084 --> 23:08.876
Okay.

23:14.042 --> 23:16.667
No one asked you to make ends meet!

23:16.667 --> 23:20.042
I sent you to Seoul to study,
so why didn't you?

23:24.751 --> 23:25.626
Missy.

23:26.917 --> 23:28.376
Who are you?

23:28.459 --> 23:30.626
Me? A friend.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.251
Friend?

23:33.459 --> 23:34.501
Girlfriend?

23:34.751 --> 23:36.334
- Yes!
- No.

23:40.126 --> 23:42.376
College student?

23:42.376 --> 23:44.542
No, I gave up school.

23:44.542 --> 23:46.584
Why? What for?

23:46.709 --> 23:48.334
It wasn't right for me.

23:48.751 --> 23:50.292
Wasn't right?

23:50.584 --> 23:52.084
No such a thing!

23:52.084 --> 23:55.709
You get used to it if you keep at it,

23:55.792 --> 23:58.626
then it becomes right!

24:00.459 --> 24:03.001
Youngsters nowadays got no persistence.

24:03.001 --> 24:04.626
- I'm sorry!
- For what!

24:06.917 --> 24:09.292
Just...about everything...

24:09.376 --> 24:12.751
Looks like you're not all that young,

24:13.084 --> 24:17.626
just stick to it and become a civil servant!

24:17.626 --> 24:19.584
That's being filial!

24:19.834 --> 24:21.792
- Mister!
- Sir.

24:23.626 --> 24:27.376
Should we...start again?

24:37.084 --> 24:38.751
Wasn't right?

24:39.834 --> 24:41.417
Shit...

24:43.459 --> 24:45.709
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

24:46.126 --> 24:48.917
Ganmi Medical and my team'd like to

24:48.917 --> 24:53.126
formally apologize for the fish man incident.

24:53.334 --> 24:58.042
By conducting protein QR42clinical trial,

24:58.292 --> 25:01.959
we discovered that enzyme used to
attach methyl to EZH2,

25:02.376 --> 25:05.251
can disassemble...

25:05.251 --> 25:08.376
This is Dr. Byun's experiment in a nutshell.

25:08.667 --> 25:11.876
Nucleus from tuna and salmon are extracted,

25:12.084 --> 25:17.001
and spliced with embryonic stem cell
to create a self-replicating protein.

25:17.167 --> 25:21.876
Taking a cue from astronauts' meals in space,

25:21.876 --> 25:24.667
this protein provides limitless energy
to the body,

25:24.667 --> 25:27.584
thereby creating a chance to end

25:27.584 --> 25:29.334
world hunger forever.

25:29.584 --> 25:31.334
During early experiments,
this protein was found to

25:31.334 --> 25:36.292
suppress cancer growth in a subject's body,

25:36.292 --> 25:39.376
and brought global attention to Dr. Byun,

25:39.376 --> 25:43.542
and became a partner of Ganmi Medical,

25:43.542 --> 25:48.376
and conducted clinical trial,
in preparation for mass production.

25:49.167 --> 25:52.667
When attached to ROR Alpha enzyme...

25:52.667 --> 25:54.334
Excuse me, doctor!

25:54.501 --> 25:56.626
So you're saying this is consumable?

25:58.417 --> 26:02.876
QR42, the protein we developed,

26:03.459 --> 26:05.376
is turned into ubiquitin
during self-replicating...

26:05.376 --> 26:06.834
In layman's terms please?

26:09.209 --> 26:12.417
This is as easy as it gets...

26:12.417 --> 26:18.042
Basically, this single pill will expand
inside the body?

26:18.542 --> 26:22.042
To be specific, it's self-replicating.

26:22.084 --> 26:23.167
- This is...
- One moment.

26:23.167 --> 26:27.709
So one can get by without food for 3 days?

26:28.209 --> 26:30.376
And prevent cancer too?

26:30.376 --> 26:31.126
So wait,

26:31.126 --> 26:35.626
this'll not only end world hunger,
but extend human life...

26:36.584 --> 26:38.126
Isn't this Nobel Prize-worthy?

26:38.459 --> 26:40.584
Nobel Prize? Really?

26:41.501 --> 26:43.167
First for a Korean?

26:43.167 --> 26:44.042
No, there was another.

26:44.042 --> 26:47.584
So, Nobel Prize in Medicine?

26:47.751 --> 26:48.917
It's a first in Medicine.

26:50.542 --> 26:53.834
I tried everything possible to meet him,

26:53.834 --> 26:57.792
but he made excuses
and declined interview requests.

26:57.959 --> 27:02.167
I really wanted to meet him and hear his story.

27:02.334 --> 27:03.626
US$400

27:03.792 --> 27:04.751
US$200

27:04.751 --> 27:06.251
US$400

27:06.667 --> 27:07.876
US$250

27:07.876 --> 27:09.501
US$400

27:11.001 --> 27:12.417
US$300

27:12.626 --> 27:14.042
US$400

27:15.459 --> 27:18.376
You're too young to be fixated on money!

27:19.709 --> 27:21.751
'You're young, so take a pay cut,'

27:21.751 --> 27:24.084
'you lack experience, so take a pay cut,'

27:24.084 --> 27:26.251
'you're passionate, so take a pay cut!'

27:26.251 --> 27:27.626
That's your logic?

27:28.209 --> 27:30.084
Goddamn trash.

27:30.709 --> 27:33.709
Okay, okay, fine! I'll give you $400.

27:34.042 --> 27:35.126
I can't go any higher.

27:38.417 --> 27:40.167
$500!

27:41.084 --> 27:43.126
You know I'm poor!

27:43.126 --> 27:46.292
And I'm busy, you know that.

27:46.292 --> 27:48.459
You just have to stay by my side.

27:48.626 --> 27:49.626
Bullshit.

27:54.626 --> 27:57.542
Why isn't this geezer showing up already?

27:57.542 --> 27:59.084
You know what?

27:59.292 --> 28:00.376
What?

28:00.459 --> 28:02.459
I don't like him.

28:03.459 --> 28:04.209
I know.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.001
You knew?

28:07.667 --> 28:11.251
He really likes you, don't hurt him.

28:11.917 --> 28:13.876
He's already pitiful.

28:15.167 --> 28:17.501
Don't you think he's lonely?

28:19.042 --> 28:21.167
He's not a person,

28:21.376 --> 28:23.042
nor a fish either.

28:26.584 --> 28:28.417
He's like me.

28:33.126 --> 28:34.917
Look, he's here! He's here!

28:36.751 --> 28:39.959
Don't be so violent, okay?

28:40.417 --> 28:42.292
You got a violent tendency.

28:43.167 --> 28:44.459
Here we go!

28:45.126 --> 28:46.084
Get off first.

28:49.292 --> 28:50.792
What now!

28:52.001 --> 28:53.292
$500!

28:53.667 --> 28:55.459
Okay, fine! $500!

28:57.084 --> 28:58.376
Okay!

29:07.292 --> 29:08.542
Dr. Byun?

29:09.751 --> 29:11.542
Doctor! Doctor!

29:11.542 --> 29:12.917
I have a few questions!

29:12.917 --> 29:14.667
Why do you deny interview requests?

29:14.667 --> 29:16.334
Do you have something to hide?

29:16.417 --> 29:18.334
Did you know about the side effects?

29:18.334 --> 29:19.917
- Before experiments...
- Over here!

29:23.626 --> 29:24.626
Ow!

29:51.709 --> 29:53.584
Where're you off to?

29:54.626 --> 29:56.417
Look out, a car!

29:56.417 --> 29:58.334
You stupid rat...

29:58.334 --> 29:59.876
You can't fool me...

30:05.084 --> 30:06.042
Dammit...

30:07.376 --> 30:09.959
Are you fucking nuts?

30:12.792 --> 30:13.959
A woman?

30:16.542 --> 30:19.917
Does she have shit in her eyes?

30:20.709 --> 30:22.042
- Get out!
- I'm so sorry!

30:22.876 --> 30:25.334
- What the heck happened?
- Ma'am, are you rich?

30:25.667 --> 30:28.334
I'll kick the shit out of you!

30:28.459 --> 30:30.334
Come out.

30:30.626 --> 30:32.334
Last chance.

30:40.376 --> 30:42.626
Life went on,

30:43.417 --> 30:47.042
and the public infatuation
for Gu never stopped.

30:47.501 --> 30:49.126
Wait a moment!

30:49.834 --> 30:52.001
Participating in clinical trials for money...

30:52.126 --> 30:55.209
Ganmi Medical was criticized
for unethical practices...

30:55.209 --> 30:58.334
Job is hard to come by,
and what little income...

30:58.334 --> 31:02.001
People sympathized with these students

31:02.209 --> 31:04.626
who had to risk their life for a petty sum.

31:05.167 --> 31:08.251
As grotesquely mutated Gu

31:08.709 --> 31:12.709
became a symbol for youths,
who are filled with despair,

31:13.126 --> 31:16.042
people became obsessed with him.

31:16.042 --> 31:20.667
Gu became a social cause that
everyone got behind.

31:27.709 --> 31:30.709
We reflected our problems through Gu.

31:30.709 --> 31:32.751
Youth unemployment is at 11.1%...

31:32.751 --> 31:36.626
Competition for civil exam is
the highest at 93:1

31:37.001 --> 31:42.376
Debate over chronic social problems
that gave birth to Gu,

31:42.376 --> 31:44.542
raged on endlessly.

31:48.209 --> 31:49.459
And finally...

31:50.792 --> 31:52.542
One comment please!

31:52.542 --> 31:53.584
"District Court Verdict"

31:53.584 --> 31:55.292
Did you expect a guilty verdict?

31:55.292 --> 31:57.084
"Ganmi Medical receives 9-month suspension"
"Dr. Byun receives 4-year sentence"

31:57.084 --> 32:01.209
This verdict...represents how judicial justice

32:01.209 --> 32:03.584
can still prevail in our country.

32:05.209 --> 32:07.584
I am...deeply moved.

32:07.584 --> 32:10.834
Dr. Byun's 4-year sentence,
Ganmi's 9-month suspension,

32:10.834 --> 32:12.292
did you expect this outcome?

32:12.292 --> 32:13.626
How about civil lawsuit?

32:13.626 --> 32:16.709
- What?
- It looked like Ganmi will appeal.

32:17.084 --> 32:21.667
We knew this was going to be a long fight.

32:21.667 --> 32:24.542
Do you expect to win the appeal?

32:24.667 --> 32:29.126
This is where attorney Kim Tae-gon
comes in to play.

32:29.542 --> 32:31.459
Abrogate temp positions!

32:31.459 --> 32:35.417
The Judicial Civil Law School grad is

32:35.417 --> 32:39.167
a notable human rights attorney
who led many strikes,

32:39.167 --> 32:43.042
and protected rights of the minorities.

32:43.042 --> 32:46.251
Rest easy, everyone!

32:46.251 --> 32:48.251
I'll be back!

32:48.251 --> 32:51.376
I'll be back to punish them!

32:51.376 --> 32:52.334
"Screaming Cabbage Head"

32:52.334 --> 32:55.876
No one can turn a deaf ear to us farmers!

32:56.251 --> 33:01.126
Agriculture is the basis of Korean economy!

33:01.917 --> 33:05.917
He was known for his work in
human rights movement,

33:06.501 --> 33:09.167
and volunteered to work

33:09.167 --> 33:12.959
our case completely pro bono.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.376
Yes, we'll win!

33:16.459 --> 33:17.834
Just wait and see.

33:18.626 --> 33:20.709
One more comment please!

33:27.042 --> 33:27.751
Attention!

33:27.959 --> 33:29.751
The real fight begins now.

33:29.751 --> 33:31.001
All right!

33:33.667 --> 33:37.376
Public perception is crucial
at this point in time.

33:37.376 --> 33:39.501
- Perception?
- Yes, that's right.

33:39.501 --> 33:42.209
This will ultimately be a media battle.

33:42.209 --> 33:47.834
Even the judge is human, and a case like this

33:47.834 --> 33:50.376
is influenced by the media.

33:51.334 --> 33:55.167
We were successful at establishing

33:55.167 --> 33:57.959
the fact that you're the victim here.

33:59.584 --> 34:00.876
Are you listening?

34:04.167 --> 34:05.084
Yes.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.542
Very good.

34:07.042 --> 34:10.333
So whenever you meet people from now on,

34:10.333 --> 34:13.708
try to smile widely as much as possible, okay?

34:13.917 --> 34:15.083
Go on, try it.

34:19.708 --> 34:21.292
Try smiling.

34:23.167 --> 34:24.876
It's all right, smile.

34:35.542 --> 34:36.917
Oh...okay.

34:37.833 --> 34:40.417
Some water?

34:41.042 --> 34:42.126
Go-un?

34:42.126 --> 34:43.751
Bring him some water!

34:45.417 --> 34:48.751
And about your hand.

34:49.501 --> 34:52.583
How about wearing gloves?

34:54.001 --> 34:55.958
And that face...

34:55.958 --> 34:57.292
can't be helped.

34:57.667 --> 34:58.334
Mr. Kim.

34:58.792 --> 34:59.917
Landlord's back again.

35:00.501 --> 35:01.501
Not gonna pay the rent?

35:02.001 --> 35:04.376
I'm with my clients.

35:04.709 --> 35:07.709
- What about my salary?
- Go away.

35:14.959 --> 35:17.292
- Mr. Kim?
- Yes?

35:17.292 --> 35:19.834
Could I ask you a question?

35:20.126 --> 35:22.042
Sure, go ahead.

35:22.167 --> 35:24.084
You know that thing.

35:24.584 --> 35:26.667
Once the trial ends,

35:26.876 --> 35:28.292
how much compensation...

35:28.292 --> 35:29.667
Mister!

35:29.876 --> 35:31.626
Are you really his father?

35:31.626 --> 35:33.334
How could you talk about compensation now?

35:33.334 --> 35:36.876
What, did I say something I shouldn't?

35:37.042 --> 35:39.542
How can he live like a human?

35:39.542 --> 35:41.292
How will he get by?

35:41.292 --> 35:45.834
He'll need support to continue living his life!

35:45.834 --> 35:48.084
And nothing for yourself?

35:48.084 --> 35:50.501
What? What did you say?

35:50.876 --> 35:52.501
Why? Guilty as charged?

35:52.501 --> 35:53.792
Why you little!

35:54.876 --> 35:56.334
Were you about to hit me?

35:56.626 --> 35:58.459
Did you see that? He was gonna hit me.

35:58.459 --> 36:01.501
Yeah, I was gonna, what can you do?

36:01.917 --> 36:03.126
Go on! Hit me!

36:03.126 --> 36:04.459
You little piece of shit!

36:04.459 --> 36:06.084
Sir, please calm down.

36:06.084 --> 36:07.792
Say it again to my face!

36:08.084 --> 36:10.501
Always barking back at adults!

36:10.501 --> 36:12.584
Come on! What! Screw you!

36:13.417 --> 36:14.959
I'll be the better man!

36:14.959 --> 36:16.334
No need!

36:17.251 --> 36:18.417
Excuse me!

36:20.542 --> 36:22.751
Some water...

36:27.917 --> 36:31.501
Meanwhile, Gu's transformation was
picking up speed,

36:32.292 --> 36:36.167
and no one knew how to stop it or slow it down.

36:38.917 --> 36:43.792
Those who examined him,
offered dismal diagnosis...

36:45.001 --> 36:45.667
5

36:46.501 --> 36:47.126
2

36:47.876 --> 36:48.751
4

36:49.084 --> 36:53.876
And no one came up with a viable treatment.

36:53.917 --> 36:58.251
This is the x-ray of Mr. Park at the time.

36:58.501 --> 37:03.417
The body has transformed almost completely.

37:03.417 --> 37:06.959
There was nothing that we could do.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.917
Couldn't even figure out the cause.

37:14.709 --> 37:16.167
Untreatable.

37:16.876 --> 37:20.126
As quickly as the doctors gave up on him,

37:20.126 --> 37:24.209
more sprung up to offer their expertise...

37:24.584 --> 37:31.209
but as their efforts failed,
we were getting exhausted.

38:03.584 --> 38:06.126
Must we resort to this?

38:06.126 --> 38:08.834
He was confident that he could help.

38:09.001 --> 38:11.584
Nothing will change.

38:11.834 --> 38:14.001
We're not a freak show.

38:14.167 --> 38:18.792
You got other options? Feel free to share.

38:20.584 --> 38:22.376
That little shit...

38:22.376 --> 38:24.751
Let's clutch any straws.

38:24.917 --> 38:27.042
Yeah, let's think positive.

38:27.042 --> 38:29.542
We'll get delicious dinner afterwards.

38:29.709 --> 38:33.334
This is absolutely nuts.

38:33.667 --> 38:36.167
Please accept our earnest prayers.

38:36.167 --> 38:41.959
Cleanse our bodies of evil
and release our guilt!

38:41.959 --> 38:46.251
Allow him to stand back up
and walk towards you,

38:46.251 --> 38:48.459
Lord please help us!

38:48.626 --> 38:50.542
Oh Lord!

38:50.542 --> 38:52.501
Hallelujah everyone!

39:08.001 --> 39:09.292
Holy Spirit!

39:16.917 --> 39:20.792
Evil! Be gone!

39:25.167 --> 39:29.584
Holy! Spirit!

39:31.459 --> 39:34.251
Accept my authority!

39:35.751 --> 39:37.209
Perverted bastard!

39:52.459 --> 39:53.667
Stupid idiot...

39:54.459 --> 39:57.834
You had to date a bimbo like her?

39:58.501 --> 39:59.792
What?

40:00.709 --> 40:02.292
What did you just say?

40:02.292 --> 40:03.876
What? What about?

40:06.042 --> 40:07.876
Shit...

40:08.084 --> 40:11.292
What did you say?

40:11.292 --> 40:12.751
"Shit"?

40:13.042 --> 40:14.959
Are you nuts?

40:18.667 --> 40:22.751
How dare you swear at an elderly!

40:22.751 --> 40:24.251
Is that how your parents taught you?

40:24.251 --> 40:26.584
I don't have parents to teach me shit!

40:26.584 --> 40:28.626
Don't bark at me!

40:29.251 --> 40:30.709
Why're you all like this?

40:30.709 --> 40:33.959
Please calm down, she was just trying.

40:33.959 --> 40:35.334
She was just trying?

40:35.459 --> 40:37.584
That bitch's looking out only for herself!

40:37.667 --> 40:40.709
Since he's getting media attention,

40:40.709 --> 40:42.501
she thinks she's a celeb or something,

40:42.501 --> 40:44.834
always thinking about how to use him!

40:44.834 --> 40:46.417
Turn that off.

40:46.417 --> 40:49.542
And you? Are you even
interested in his treatment?

40:49.542 --> 40:52.751
Do you care if your son's a fish or not?

40:52.751 --> 40:54.626
What did you say?

40:54.626 --> 40:56.167
You think we're clueless?

40:56.167 --> 40:58.626
You want to pocket as much money as possible!

40:58.626 --> 41:02.459
Jin, please be respectful.

41:02.667 --> 41:05.292
Sir, where are you going?

41:08.167 --> 41:09.292
Sir...

41:10.667 --> 41:12.376
Don't touch me!

41:12.376 --> 41:13.959
- Sir.
- What are you?

41:13.959 --> 41:15.917
Are you my son's lover?

41:16.251 --> 41:17.709
Why are you here?

41:17.709 --> 41:20.626
What if I am, what if it's love?

41:20.667 --> 41:21.584
Love?

41:21.709 --> 41:24.459
Then will you marry him?

41:24.459 --> 41:26.292
Even if he's a fish?

41:26.292 --> 41:30.084
He's barely a man, can you handle that?

41:35.834 --> 41:37.542
Get out.

41:37.792 --> 41:41.209
They're not here for you, get out.

41:41.209 --> 41:45.376
That's much too harsh. You shouldn't say that.

41:46.417 --> 41:48.167
This is good.

41:48.542 --> 41:52.334
Gu, think carefully now.

41:52.542 --> 41:55.459
If you get off, I'll never see you!

41:55.584 --> 41:57.417
Last chance!

41:57.667 --> 42:00.459
You really won't get off, asshole?

42:24.501 --> 42:25.876
It's settled.

42:26.917 --> 42:29.584
Love, my ass.

42:31.709 --> 42:34.626
I refuse to drive with her.

42:34.626 --> 42:37.626
Come with me, or stay with her!

42:37.626 --> 42:39.917
Come on, sir.

42:41.584 --> 42:43.209
You too...

42:44.959 --> 42:46.792
What a mess...

42:50.834 --> 42:53.084
What to do...

42:54.584 --> 42:56.209
Get in.

42:58.042 --> 43:00.126
How can we leave her here?

43:00.126 --> 43:01.751
Just get in.

43:03.834 --> 43:05.417
Not coming?

43:32.709 --> 43:34.209
Bastard...

43:38.251 --> 43:39.459
It was strange.

43:40.792 --> 43:45.667
As if on cue, the media began
defending Dr. Byun.

43:47.001 --> 43:51.542
They wrote about the importance of his work,

43:51.542 --> 43:55.959
and attacked Gu's supporters
with baseless arguments.

43:56.292 --> 43:58.709
This will become food of the future.

43:58.792 --> 44:02.292
But it doesn't look very appetizing.

44:03.626 --> 44:08.167
No, it may not look like much,
but it's quite delicious.

44:08.334 --> 44:10.917
What I have here is meat flavored.

44:12.667 --> 44:17.209
We're developing cream cheese,
tomato sauce and others too.

44:17.209 --> 44:20.209
The outcome of your experiment is astonishing,

44:20.209 --> 44:25.376
but wasn't there a mutant as result of it?

44:26.834 --> 44:28.209
That's right.

44:29.376 --> 44:33.417
Of the thousand or so clinical trial subjects,

44:34.126 --> 44:37.959
only Mr. Park Gu developed a mutation.

44:38.167 --> 44:40.626
This is a problem we must solve.

44:40.709 --> 44:41.917
Time's running out.

44:42.209 --> 44:43.334
What do you mean?

44:43.626 --> 44:45.709
Scientists from USA, Japan,
Russia, and other countries

44:45.709 --> 44:50.167
are conducting similar experiments.

44:50.959 --> 44:54.084
But as we were diverted by the lawsuit,

44:54.084 --> 44:57.959
other teams began catching up at a rapid speed.

44:59.001 --> 45:03.709
Korea had the chance to be
the future energy industry leader

45:05.459 --> 45:07.626
but we're losing it all.

45:07.959 --> 45:11.376
A scientist's dream to end world hunger.

45:11.376 --> 45:13.251
What are your thoughts?

45:13.459 --> 45:16.292
Foreign press compares Dr. Byun's work

45:16.292 --> 45:19.667
to a new sun given to humanity...

45:20.209 --> 45:23.584
In order to protect one man's rights,

45:23.584 --> 45:28.376
are we giving away our chance
to become a global powerhouse...

45:28.584 --> 45:29.751
Sang-won.

45:30.001 --> 45:30.959
Yes?

45:31.292 --> 45:34.042
They still don't know you're a reporter, right?

45:35.501 --> 45:37.084
No, not yet.

45:37.084 --> 45:38.876
- Let's give it up.
- What?

45:38.876 --> 45:39.834
No more of this.

45:41.084 --> 45:43.376
Then what about all the work so far?

45:43.376 --> 45:47.917
I'll secure your job, so gather all tapes,

45:47.917 --> 45:50.042
and pull yourself out of there.

45:50.042 --> 45:51.751
Why? Something happen?

45:51.751 --> 45:53.792
Don't ask questions...

45:54.917 --> 45:57.084
Just do what I say.

45:58.917 --> 46:03.334
And one huge blow that turned the tide...

46:03.459 --> 46:05.251
"Park Gu's violation"
As you see, Mr. Park's hand is on his crotch.

46:05.251 --> 46:07.084
"Of clinical trial rules"
As you see, Mr. Park's hand is on his crotch.

46:07.376 --> 46:09.542
As you can see,

46:09.584 --> 46:13.334
his hand moves vertically about 15cm.

46:13.834 --> 46:15.376
Take a look.

46:17.834 --> 46:21.584
Which goes like this.

46:25.042 --> 46:28.501
But 2 photos alone...

46:29.126 --> 46:30.209
don't prove your case.

46:31.042 --> 46:32.417
Is there a video?

46:33.584 --> 46:35.167
When I took those photos,

46:35.376 --> 46:37.417
I was repulsed by it.

46:37.709 --> 46:40.667
I was so shocked that
I couldn't even think about

46:40.667 --> 46:44.542
switching to video mode.

46:45.334 --> 46:47.251
But I saw it with my own eyes!

46:49.459 --> 46:54.626
I can't believe he did that
while looking at me.

46:56.501 --> 47:00.084
After seeing this photo, I can't get any sleep.

47:01.792 --> 47:07.251
Whenever I dream, I get raped by a fish!

47:28.292 --> 47:31.626
According to article 7.3 in the release form

47:31.792 --> 47:33.459
for the clinical trial,

47:33.459 --> 47:38.209
â€œDuring the trial period of 3 days,
he must not engage in

47:38.209 --> 47:40.209
any sexual activities...

47:44.542 --> 47:46.834
- Is Mr. Park inside?
- You'll break your hand!

47:50.709 --> 47:51.959
"Fish Man Sexually Molested Nurse"

47:54.001 --> 47:55.834
Why didn't you tell me?

47:57.126 --> 47:58.501
The thing is...

47:58.501 --> 48:00.834
Do you understand the gravity
of this situation?

48:00.959 --> 48:04.292
What's so big deal about a guy jerking off?

48:04.292 --> 48:06.376
Do you know what's going on?

48:06.626 --> 48:07.376
Do you?

48:10.084 --> 48:11.959
Ogwang is involved! Ogwang!

48:11.959 --> 48:12.792
"Ogwang and Ganmi in merger talks"

48:13.167 --> 48:14.167
Ogwang?

48:14.167 --> 48:16.459
Ogwang bought Ganmi!

48:16.459 --> 48:18.876
M&A! You see this?

48:19.792 --> 48:24.626
They'll build factories,
and invest heavily in Dr. Byun!

48:24.626 --> 48:27.084
Why'd a big corporation do this?

48:27.084 --> 48:29.084
Got a whiff of the money, goddammit...

48:29.917 --> 48:33.042
Those damn capitalist pigs...

48:33.042 --> 48:35.959
So what do we do now?

48:36.042 --> 48:39.376
I need to get rid of
those pesky reporters first,

48:39.376 --> 48:41.751
so take this seriously!

48:45.251 --> 48:48.542
Why did you have to jerk off there?

48:48.542 --> 48:51.376
- Is Park Gu inside?
- Is this true?

48:51.376 --> 48:55.209
I'll explain everything, please follow me.

48:55.667 --> 48:57.667
Follow me, please! Let's go downstairs!

48:57.667 --> 49:00.126
Follow me!

49:01.667 --> 49:03.959
"Chief Kim: Still there? Wanna get fired?"

49:07.709 --> 49:08.584
I...

49:10.209 --> 49:11.834
didn't do it.

49:12.542 --> 49:13.251
What?

49:17.001 --> 49:19.542
I didn't jerk off.

49:20.792 --> 49:21.751
Are you for real?

49:32.167 --> 49:35.126
...that Korea must have global presence

49:35.126 --> 49:37.834
in the field of medicine,
and that his government

49:37.834 --> 49:41.459
will support and nurture
pharmaceutical companies.

49:41.459 --> 49:45.417
Export rate has hit a wall
and maintained that level

49:45.417 --> 49:48.001
- for some time now.
- Yes, it's been 3 years.

49:48.001 --> 49:51.959
5-day old Vatsim had nothing to eat today.

49:51.959 --> 49:53.542
Their desperate lives...

49:53.542 --> 49:56.751
For a brief moment of gratification,

49:57.584 --> 50:01.792
men are throwing away God-given seeds...

50:02.251 --> 50:04.667
He was depressed.

50:05.126 --> 50:08.126
He looked unkept somehow.

50:08.126 --> 50:13.542
I remember clearly,
I was the 6th grade class rep.

50:15.209 --> 50:16.376
"Appeals Court Verdict"

50:16.376 --> 50:18.209
"Ganmi Medical not guilty,
Gu must continue experiments"

50:18.209 --> 50:19.709
Here they come! Over there!

50:20.876 --> 50:22.542
What's your reaction to the verdict?

50:22.542 --> 50:23.667
Will you appeal?

50:23.709 --> 50:25.834
Do you acknowledge the masturbation?

50:26.084 --> 50:27.876
There isn't much to say.

50:27.876 --> 50:29.792
Move! out of my way!

50:29.792 --> 50:32.042
You're a damn commie!

50:33.917 --> 50:37.792
Pro-North Koreans! Go jerk off in the north!

50:37.792 --> 50:39.376
I am a patriot!

50:39.376 --> 50:41.209
- You can't do that!
- Let go!

50:41.209 --> 50:42.334
Give us a statement!

50:54.459 --> 50:58.209
You know what happened next.

50:59.084 --> 51:02.792
People raged over the irrational verdict,

51:02.959 --> 51:07.084
and immediately began a candlelight vigil.

51:07.542 --> 51:11.334
From college students to housewives,

51:11.334 --> 51:13.584
they all began to march.

51:13.584 --> 51:15.667
Wipe out the fish man!

51:15.667 --> 51:17.292
Wipe out! Wipe out!

51:17.292 --> 51:22.584
But the critics' voices became even louder.

51:29.876 --> 51:32.334
Inflicted by the riot police,
the vigil has turned violent...

51:32.334 --> 51:35.709
The candlelight vigil has become aggressive...

51:35.709 --> 51:37.042
The police used water cannons and tasers...

51:37.042 --> 51:40.251
...claims that the vigil has a mastermind...

51:40.251 --> 51:43.251
backed by supporters of North Korea...

51:43.251 --> 51:47.834
In a world divided,

51:48.959 --> 51:52.459
2 completely different mutants

51:53.459 --> 51:55.501
came to a clash...

52:05.792 --> 52:07.459
You're here early.

52:09.459 --> 52:12.584
Mr. Kim requested an early meeting.

52:24.084 --> 52:27.251
"I'm sorry. I'll just disappear."

52:31.084 --> 52:33.584
You bastard, where are you?

52:34.167 --> 52:35.959
We're driving around to look for him.

52:35.959 --> 52:37.792
Why are you still there?

52:37.917 --> 52:39.709
How can I stop here?

52:39.709 --> 52:40.876
Snap out of it.

52:40.876 --> 52:43.959
And he didn't do anything wrong.

52:43.959 --> 52:45.417
Why is that important?

52:45.417 --> 52:46.876
Then what is?

52:46.876 --> 52:49.251
Why are you so selfish?

52:49.417 --> 52:53.542
You're not the only one fucked
if you're discovered!

52:55.292 --> 52:57.251
Get the footages,

52:57.251 --> 52:59.376
and everything else, and hurry back!

52:59.917 --> 53:03.334
If you return now, I'll make you a full-timer.

53:03.709 --> 53:07.167
You understand? I'll wait.

53:08.501 --> 53:10.542
$4.90 please.

53:13.876 --> 53:16.292
It was around then...

53:17.292 --> 53:21.667
when unsolvable questions sprang up.

53:23.042 --> 53:25.126
Looks like he was here.

53:33.834 --> 53:37.042
Where could he have gone?

53:41.792 --> 53:46.209
Where could he be now?

53:51.792 --> 53:56.084
Wanna go watch a movie?

54:07.126 --> 54:10.459
What did I really know about him?

54:22.834 --> 54:24.334
What was he...

54:25.334 --> 54:27.709
thinking then?

54:54.959 --> 54:56.209
Mr. Seo Sang-won?

54:56.834 --> 54:58.834
ABS tempreporter Seo Sang-won?

54:58.834 --> 55:00.376
It's him, take his picture.

55:00.792 --> 55:01.709
What's going on?

55:01.709 --> 55:02.959
Do you know what you're doing?

55:02.959 --> 55:05.167
Backstabbing those who are in the union?

55:05.209 --> 55:06.334
Call yourself a man?

55:06.334 --> 55:07.501
What's the matter with you!

55:07.501 --> 55:08.376
Strike's not ending
because of douches like you.

55:08.376 --> 55:09.292
You got the wrong guy!

55:09.292 --> 55:10.709
Shame on you!

55:10.834 --> 55:12.376
What's going on!

55:12.376 --> 55:14.417
Don't look so clueless.

55:16.126 --> 55:18.126
What's this? Check it out.

55:18.459 --> 55:20.542
It's the fish man data.

55:20.542 --> 55:22.792
He was the mole.

55:22.876 --> 55:25.292
So you were the one?

55:25.292 --> 55:29.126
No wonder the news is
all messed up, you douche.

55:29.126 --> 55:30.459
Thinks he's a reporter.

55:30.459 --> 55:32.126
Fuck that, he's a community college grad.

55:32.126 --> 55:33.667
Reporting is not for everyone.

55:33.667 --> 55:35.292
Know your place.

55:35.292 --> 55:36.917
Take the photo.

55:37.667 --> 55:39.626
Got everything? Hurry.

55:41.376 --> 55:43.001
We got everything.

55:43.542 --> 55:45.459
What should do with him?

55:49.917 --> 55:51.292
Let's go.

55:52.126 --> 55:53.667
Let's move.

55:58.584 --> 56:00.959
What should I do then?

56:01.417 --> 56:03.126
From a community college,

56:04.167 --> 56:07.209
and no network whatsoever.

56:09.292 --> 56:12.376
What should I do then?

56:14.167 --> 56:16.126
Get with the program.

57:33.667 --> 57:37.209
What! What! What!

57:43.501 --> 57:44.334
Holy crap...

57:48.959 --> 57:51.209
I wonder if this will work.

57:54.667 --> 57:56.376
What happened to you?

58:00.667 --> 58:02.626
I had nowhere to go.

58:03.959 --> 58:06.417
I thought hard...

58:07.501 --> 58:09.792
but I came up with empty.

58:10.667 --> 58:11.917
I just...

58:12.167 --> 58:13.709
I was wandering,

58:14.417 --> 58:18.167
and a few middle school kids recognized me.

58:20.501 --> 58:22.876
They started beating me,

58:24.334 --> 58:28.417
calling me a mutant, and that I'm bad luck.

58:29.501 --> 58:34.001
During the beatdown, I started laughing.

58:36.001 --> 58:37.334
Actually...

58:37.792 --> 58:41.292
they weren't wrong.

58:48.167 --> 58:49.834
Okay, I got it,

58:51.042 --> 58:54.876
so let's just rest, okay?

58:56.501 --> 58:57.792
Sang-won.

59:01.959 --> 59:04.876
Could you do me a favor?

59:12.959 --> 59:16.209
I've only seen it once

59:17.542 --> 59:20.959
during my high school field trip.

59:21.876 --> 59:23.376
Isn't it funny?

59:26.001 --> 59:29.417
I never saw it afterwards.

59:31.334 --> 59:34.251
I could've just gone.

59:36.084 --> 59:38.917
But like an idiot, I never did.

59:40.001 --> 59:41.334
The ocean...

59:44.667 --> 59:45.709
And?

59:46.126 --> 59:48.209
Anything else you want to say?

59:59.042 --> 01:00:00.584
No, that's all.

01:00:00.584 --> 01:00:02.251
That's your only favor?

01:00:02.834 --> 01:00:05.042
Filming you say that was your only favor?

01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:09.917
What's your dream?

01:00:09.917 --> 01:00:11.334
Me?

01:00:13.084 --> 01:00:14.209
Well...

01:00:15.959 --> 01:00:17.584
I just wanted...

01:00:19.834 --> 01:00:23.792
to be a normal person.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:33.584
Get a job like a normal person,
get married, have kids...

01:00:34.917 --> 01:00:39.917
An ordinary man.

01:00:48.751 --> 01:00:50.167
I...

01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:55.834
wanted to be a reporter.

01:00:58.334 --> 01:00:59.709
Why?

01:01:03.917 --> 01:01:09.042
I wanted to represent the people
and uncover the truth,

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:15.584
and be a man of justice, who report injustice,

01:01:17.167 --> 01:01:23.376
the one protected the weak...

01:01:28.959 --> 01:01:30.042
Awesome.

01:01:32.709 --> 01:01:34.251
But it didn't happen.

01:01:36.542 --> 01:01:38.001
Why?

01:01:53.417 --> 01:01:56.792
I'll prep your bed, come on out.

01:01:59.834 --> 01:02:00.751
I'll...

01:02:03.584 --> 01:02:05.084
just stay here.

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:13.709
This feels more comfortable now.

01:02:25.084 --> 01:02:27.126
"8 Missed Calls: Chief Kim"

01:02:37.126 --> 01:02:40.042
I wanted to be a real reporter.

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:51.167
Where's Mr. Kim?

01:02:51.292 --> 01:02:53.167
He's out to meet a client.

01:02:53.167 --> 01:02:54.417
Where?

01:03:27.459 --> 01:03:28.917
Park Gu!

01:03:31.001 --> 01:03:32.334
Hey!

01:03:33.626 --> 01:03:34.876
Gu!

01:03:35.292 --> 01:03:36.959
Come on!

01:03:38.209 --> 01:03:40.084
What the hell!

01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:42.834
Not like this!

01:03:43.001 --> 01:03:44.084
Dammit!

01:03:44.084 --> 01:03:46.084
Come on!

01:03:47.459 --> 01:03:49.792
You can't do this!

01:03:55.709 --> 01:03:57.917
"E.R."

01:03:58.917 --> 01:04:01.251
Tell me, what happened?

01:04:01.459 --> 01:04:03.751
It's not life threatening.

01:04:03.876 --> 01:04:07.501
He hung his gills, not his neck.

01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:37.876
Who the hell are you?

01:04:37.876 --> 01:04:38.917
What's your game?

01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:39.834
What's Wrong?

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:42.542
Plenty! You're an ABS reporter!

01:04:42.542 --> 01:04:44.834
I saw it all online, asshole!

01:04:45.001 --> 01:04:48.251
Sir, he's an ABS reporter!

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:51.042
Documentarian? What a load of bull crap!

01:04:51.376 --> 01:04:53.876
You followed us around, and reported every move

01:04:53.876 --> 01:04:55.834
back to your station!

01:04:56.542 --> 01:04:58.376
And you, sir?

01:04:58.876 --> 01:05:00.417
Making shady deals with Dr. Byun?

01:05:00.834 --> 01:05:01.917
What?

01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:03.917
Thought no one'd find out?

01:05:04.417 --> 01:05:07.876
I saw you meeting with him in secrecy!

01:05:08.084 --> 01:05:10.126
You've been doing it for a while.

01:05:10.501 --> 01:05:12.876
I have the evidence too.

01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:21.417
Yeah, I met him.

01:05:26.042 --> 01:05:28.209
Yes, I did.

01:05:30.334 --> 01:05:33.126
I've been a lawyer for 15 years,

01:05:34.876 --> 01:05:37.292
and we have to try everything.

01:05:39.667 --> 01:05:42.042
So I met up with him.

01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:00.959
The thing is...

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:05.709
we can never...

01:06:08.917 --> 01:06:10.709
win this case...

01:06:14.751 --> 01:06:16.376
How much will they pay?

01:06:20.251 --> 01:06:21.417
Sir.

01:06:24.084 --> 01:06:25.959
Enough?

01:06:27.542 --> 01:06:33.417
Enough for him to live like a man,

01:06:34.042 --> 01:06:35.084
that much?

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:37.751
What are you saying?

01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:42.334
Whether he dies now or later,
it's all the same.

01:06:42.334 --> 01:06:44.709
No! Absolutely not!

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.792
You know what they are!

01:06:46.792 --> 01:06:48.251
Aren't you with them?

01:06:55.376 --> 01:06:57.334
Everyone...

01:06:57.376 --> 01:06:58.959
please stop...

01:07:40.417 --> 01:07:44.126
You got a knack for startling people.

01:07:46.959 --> 01:07:47.959
"Civil Service Exam"

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:53.542
Why are you here? For what?

01:08:00.917 --> 01:08:02.334
Sorry.

01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:04.084
What?

01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:10.459
I wanted to apologize.

01:08:13.709 --> 01:08:14.959
I am sorry.

01:08:28.334 --> 01:08:30.667
Get your shit together!

01:08:31.417 --> 01:08:34.251
Do you know who sold you off to Ganmi?

01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:36.876
It was me, idiot!

01:08:37.167 --> 01:08:39.126
I used you.

01:08:39.751 --> 01:08:41.542
This is me.

01:08:42.001 --> 01:08:45.584
I'm selfish and a bitch.

01:08:45.876 --> 01:08:47.209
Know that?

01:08:48.459 --> 01:08:50.876
I troll random online forums,

01:08:50.876 --> 01:08:56.209
and pick random fights
and being arrogant is all I know!

01:09:00.042 --> 01:09:03.209
I'm a nobody in real world!

01:09:40.667 --> 01:09:42.834
I wanted to do something for you,

01:09:45.126 --> 01:09:46.667
but didn't know what.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:50.084
I'm an idiot, right?

01:10:01.959 --> 01:10:03.959
I never once liked you!

01:10:14.626 --> 01:10:16.001
I know.

01:10:38.292 --> 01:10:40.834
I'm in front of Ganmi Medical.

01:10:40.834 --> 01:10:45.084
Park Gu's car is approaching the building.

01:10:45.334 --> 01:10:51.292
It's difficult for it to pass through
so many people near the gate.

01:10:51.459 --> 01:10:55.834
In his current half-man, half-fish condition,

01:10:55.834 --> 01:10:59.792
it may be difficult for him to sustain life.

01:10:59.792 --> 01:11:04.667
This may have been the deciding factor for him.

01:11:04.667 --> 01:11:08.167
Park Gu! Park Gu!

01:11:08.167 --> 01:11:10.042
And that was...

01:11:10.042 --> 01:11:13.084
the last time I ever saw him.

01:11:13.501 --> 01:11:17.001
N.S.E. test, take 7,

01:11:17.001 --> 01:11:19.667
360V 25A.

01:11:25.584 --> 01:11:27.042
Ow! It hurts!

01:11:27.042 --> 01:11:29.709
Hold him down! Pin him down!

01:11:39.792 --> 01:11:41.417
Come here, over here!

01:11:41.417 --> 01:11:42.167
Lie down, lie down!

01:11:42.167 --> 01:11:43.459
Did something go wrong?

01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:46.167
What's with him?

01:11:50.084 --> 01:11:52.251
What's wrong?

01:11:53.459 --> 01:11:54.292
That's weird.

01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:56.251
Passing out at only 35cc?

01:11:58.001 --> 01:11:59.292
35cc?

01:11:59.501 --> 01:12:01.001
Not 95cc?

01:12:01.292 --> 01:12:04.042
No, it was 35cc.

01:12:05.959 --> 01:12:07.376
Wrong dosage.

01:12:08.876 --> 01:12:10.792
Do it right, asshole! He could've been fucked!

01:12:10.792 --> 01:12:11.834
Almost fucked...

01:12:11.876 --> 01:12:14.084
I thought he was trying to swim.

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:18.542
What's this?

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:21.459
We were conduction a CH3CHO reaction test.

01:12:21.459 --> 01:12:22.709
Right.

01:12:24.459 --> 01:12:28.751
He displayed symptoms of seizure at 35cc.

01:12:28.751 --> 01:12:31.709
- It could've been bad.
- Yes.

01:12:32.292 --> 01:12:34.542
Be respectful.

01:12:36.459 --> 01:12:38.834
He's a human too.

01:12:39.917 --> 01:12:41.292
Yes, sir.

01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:49.584
Thanks to his sacrifice,
Vector9 had a big launch,

01:12:49.667 --> 01:12:52.167
but Dr. Byun's dream never came true.

01:13:23.876 --> 01:13:25.417
That's it for today.

01:13:48.209 --> 01:13:51.209
I missed out on so many things in my life.

01:13:51.542 --> 01:13:54.292
So many fun things in the world.

01:13:54.917 --> 01:13:56.251
Mr. Chairman.

01:13:56.792 --> 01:14:01.751
Vector9 was designed to end world hunger.

01:14:03.126 --> 01:14:08.001
At such high price, the product is meaningless.

01:14:09.626 --> 01:14:11.417
Go see for yourself.

01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:16.376
Vector9 is nothing more than
a luxury item for the top 1%.

01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:21.251
My life and my work are being insulted!

01:14:21.292 --> 01:14:22.667
Doctor.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:25.167
Why do you bother me with that?

01:14:26.209 --> 01:14:27.834
I'm just a...

01:14:27.834 --> 01:14:29.959
humble salesman.

01:14:30.876 --> 01:14:34.667
The price isn't set by people like myself.

01:14:38.542 --> 01:14:40.459
It is set by ambition.

01:14:42.417 --> 01:14:48.792
Blame people's ambition, not me.

01:15:08.334 --> 01:15:10.251
I've been a fool.

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:14.459
I am so sorry.

01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:27.251
And not long afterwards...

01:15:42.542 --> 01:15:47.959
Gu's unpredictable life came to an end.

01:15:59.751 --> 01:16:05.834
It was only then, that I saw his real face.

01:16:26.209 --> 01:16:28.084
Get anything?

01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:30.542
Give me the recorder.

01:16:31.917 --> 01:16:33.459
Yo, community college!

01:16:33.584 --> 01:16:35.834
What's up with him?

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:39.167
Get the recorder.

01:16:44.459 --> 01:16:45.751
Goddammit!

01:16:45.959 --> 01:16:48.084
Son of a bitch!

01:16:51.376 --> 01:16:55.167
How can we be so cruel?

01:17:05.126 --> 01:17:07.001
It's all busted, dammit.

01:17:58.709 --> 01:18:00.876
What was thought to be over,
Gu's story took a surprising turn

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:05.209
with Mr. Kim's announcement.

01:18:05.334 --> 01:18:09.042
Vector9's creator Dr. Byun is...

01:18:10.251 --> 01:18:11.584
nothing more than a swindler.

01:18:11.584 --> 01:18:17.001
That Dr. Byun had the means
to turn Gu back to his human form.

01:18:17.417 --> 01:18:21.709
A new trial was quickly set,
and for his negligence,

01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:25.084
he received 7-year sentence.

01:18:25.626 --> 01:18:30.417
A hero became a con man,
and a con man became a hero.

01:18:32.501 --> 01:18:35.042
Dr. Byun is still behind bars...

01:18:36.417 --> 01:18:38.167
Good to see you!

01:18:38.167 --> 01:18:41.209
Mr. Kim became a politician.

01:18:42.542 --> 01:18:48.417
It was rumored that he took bribes from Ogwang.

01:18:50.167 --> 01:18:53.209
Gu's father is dedicating his retirement

01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:55.376
to volunteer work for the country...

01:18:56.251 --> 01:19:00.501
And Jin became a typical civil servant.

01:19:02.417 --> 01:19:04.501
She found her calling.

01:19:08.251 --> 01:19:10.417
The time passed rapidly.

01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:14.334
I became a full-timer.

01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:18.501
Sorry!

01:19:19.959 --> 01:19:21.667
But not a real reporter.

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:26.876
Unable to adjust to the life of a reporter,

01:19:27.459 --> 01:19:29.042
I followed the chief to the culture bureau.

01:19:29.042 --> 01:19:30.709
Salivating and going wild,
those are the money shots!

01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:33.209
Work is...work.

01:19:36.501 --> 01:19:38.834
And...yesterday

01:19:39.959 --> 01:19:42.084
Don't give up.

01:19:43.542 --> 01:19:48.167
It'd be a shame, you're his last hope.

01:20:22.501 --> 01:20:23.917
The day we spread Gu's ashes,

01:20:24.876 --> 01:20:26.917
this was taken by chance.

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:30.292
Look at the bottom right.

01:20:34.417 --> 01:20:36.334
Gu is not dead.

01:20:37.001 --> 01:20:39.834
He came to see us that day.

01:20:44.417 --> 01:20:46.209
Please tell me.

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:50.876
Where does the lie end and truth begin?

01:21:03.626 --> 01:21:04.584
It's a secret.

01:21:05.834 --> 01:21:06.792
What?

01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:15.376
But there's no secret in the world.

01:21:17.167 --> 01:21:18.917
Did you tell him?

01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:23.501
That there was a treatment?

01:21:27.167 --> 01:21:28.542
He already knew.

01:21:33.417 --> 01:21:35.459
I'm so sorry.

01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:42.417
I could've turned you back since the beginning.

01:21:45.792 --> 01:21:47.876
But I was blinded.

01:21:50.459 --> 01:21:52.209
I'm so sorry.

01:21:55.501 --> 01:21:58.209
If I knew then what I know now...

01:22:01.292 --> 01:22:04.084
But I could still...

01:22:15.751 --> 01:22:16.792
Fish...

01:22:17.959 --> 01:22:20.417
He wanted to live as a fish.

01:22:21.251 --> 01:22:23.292
As a fish?

01:22:23.542 --> 01:22:27.459
I looked into his eyes for a long time.

01:22:28.834 --> 01:22:32.292
He meant it.

01:22:35.667 --> 01:22:40.417
I didn't understand, but I wanted to help.

01:22:41.334 --> 01:22:43.167
It was my only way

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:46.709
to beg for his forgiveness.

01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:52.167
Seeing him walk into the ocean,

01:23:53.626 --> 01:23:55.501
I was envious.

01:24:04.876 --> 01:24:09.917
Lastly, he asked for one final favor.

01:24:13.584 --> 01:24:15.917
In a slim chance,

01:24:17.376 --> 01:24:20.042
very, very slim chance,

01:24:25.834 --> 01:24:28.792
if you were to come and ask for the truth,

01:24:29.292 --> 01:24:32.334
he wanted me to tell you everything.

01:24:37.792 --> 01:24:39.417
Why?

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:42.959
I asked him that too.

01:24:44.584 --> 01:24:45.709
What for?

01:24:58.334 --> 01:25:00.834
Wanting the truth,

01:25:03.459 --> 01:25:06.292
is the job of a real reporter.

01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:14.501
Yo Mr. Documentary!

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:24.209
I forgot something.

01:26:27.042 --> 01:26:28.084
What is it?

01:26:29.167 --> 01:26:32.876
You're still clueless.

01:26:32.959 --> 01:26:34.917
What do you think?

01:26:38.334 --> 01:26:39.834
Hey, Jin!

01:26:41.959 --> 01:26:43.542
Why do you keep bringing me stuff?

01:26:45.209 --> 01:26:46.667
What do you expect me to do?

01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:51.126
Well...

01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:55.959
I thought you could do something with it.

01:26:57.417 --> 01:27:01.417
Something that I can't...

01:28:07.626 --> 01:28:09.709
Bastard, smoking again?

01:28:10.126 --> 01:28:13.376
That's weird, a smoke-free day.

01:28:14.209 --> 01:28:16.709
The air's nice and clean!

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.542
Isn't it nice when you don't smoke?

01:28:21.417 --> 01:28:22.209
What's this?

01:28:22.792 --> 01:28:23.459
Chief.

01:28:24.542 --> 01:28:25.334
What?

01:28:25.334 --> 01:28:26.584
I'm quitting smoking.

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:28.126
Really?

01:28:28.667 --> 01:28:29.584
What's got into you?

01:28:29.584 --> 01:28:33.292
And I'm not editing sting ray segment.

01:28:34.084 --> 01:28:35.084
What?

01:28:36.667 --> 01:28:39.709
They fucking suck.

01:28:42.876 --> 01:28:44.417
Are you nuts?

01:28:44.417 --> 01:28:48.542
I got real work, gotta finish the doc.

01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:52.626
You feeling okay today?

01:28:52.917 --> 01:28:55.584
Fire me if you wish, you have my blessing.

01:28:56.626 --> 01:28:57.667
Seo Sang-won! Hey!

01:28:57.667 --> 01:28:58.459
And this!

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:01.084
Take it from my severance.

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:09.917
There was a man.

01:29:11.417 --> 01:29:17.251
He came out of nowhere
and pushed our society into chaos.

01:29:19.667 --> 01:29:23.417
He made us laugh and cry.

01:29:24.667 --> 01:29:29.584
The story of a man, who was also a fish...

01:29:31.626 --> 01:29:33.584
begins here.

01:30:30.334 --> 01:30:37.042
@
