WEBVTT

00:03.900 --> 00:05.500
CHEF PAOLO, AFTER YOU.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.600
MIGHT AS WELL GET
YOUR CHOLESTEROL
CHECKED BEFORE ME.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.767
THANK YOU, MR. MOSEBY.
THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU.

00:09.767 --> 00:12.967
OH, LADIES FIRST.
GO AHEAD.

00:12.967 --> 00:14.967
MADELINE.

00:14.967 --> 00:17.467
AH, IS THE BIG MAN SCARED
OF A LITTLE NEEDLE?

00:17.467 --> 00:18.467
OH...

00:18.467 --> 00:22.033
NO, I'M JUST BEING
CONSIDERATE.

00:22.033 --> 00:24.133
SO AM I. AFTER YOU.

00:24.133 --> 00:25.600
I INSIST.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.100
I DECLINE.

00:27.100 --> 00:28.000
OH...

00:28.000 --> 00:29.734
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:29.734 --> 00:31.367
CHOLESTEROL TEST.

00:31.367 --> 00:34.400
PROBABLY THE ONLY TEST
ZACK COULD PASS.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.033
WOULD YOU BOYS LIKE TO
GO IN FRONT OF ME?

00:37.033 --> 00:39.200
MR. MOSEBY'S AFRAID.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.500
OH, PISH POSH.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.100
I LAUGH
AT THAT NEEDLE.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.600
HA!

00:43.600 --> 00:46.500

HEY, MADDIE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.967
ACTUALLY--
DON'T CARE.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.567
I'M HOSTING A JUNIOR
FASHION SHOW AT
THE TIPTON.

01:45.567 --> 01:47.233
DO GO ALONG WITH
HEALTH AND FITNESS WEEK.

01:47.233 --> 01:50.867
WE'RE RAISING MONEY
TO GET KIDS
FREE INFECTIONS.

01:50.867 --> 01:53.033
YOU MEAN FREE INJECTIONS?

01:53.033 --> 01:54.500
DETAILS.

01:55.667 --> 01:56.767
I'M GONNA LOOK GREAT.

01:56.767 --> 01:57.867
YOU WANNA BE IN IT, TOO?

01:57.867 --> 01:59.467
I'D LOVE TO.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.300
OK, COME BY
THE BALLROOM LATER,

02:01.300 --> 02:03.000
AND PICK OUT THE OUTFITS
YOU WANT TO WEAR.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.367
GET THERE EARLY

02:04.367 --> 02:05.967
BECAUSE FRANCESCA
GRUMMAN WILL BE THERE.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.300
I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T
STAND HER.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.600
I CAN'T. SHE IS
A HORRIBLE PERSON.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.667
SHE'S NASTY, CATTY,
AND RUDE.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.200
WELL, THEN WHY DID YOU
INVITE HER?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.367
BECAUSE SHE'S ONE OF
MY BEST FRIENDS.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.100
[SWALLOWS] AH...

02:28.100 --> 02:31.300
YOU KNOW, THIS
HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE
IS REALLY INTERESTING.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.700
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU,

02:32.700 --> 02:35.567
BUT YOU MIGHT EAT IT.

02:35.567 --> 02:38.367
NOT UNLESS IT'S MADE
OF CHOCOLATE.

02:38.367 --> 02:42.133
ZACK, DO YOU REALIZE
THAT KIDS WHO EAT
TOO MUCH SUGAR

02:42.133 --> 02:44.500
INCREASE THEIR RISK
OF GETTING DIABETES?

02:44.500 --> 02:46.133
SO WE'LL COMPROMISE.

02:46.133 --> 02:49.000
I WON'T PUT SUGAR
ON MY CAKE ANYMORE.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.133
THIS IS SERIOUS,
YOUNG MAN.

02:51.133 --> 02:52.834
WE'RE CHANGING
YOUR DIET.

02:52.834 --> 02:55.567
WHAT ARE YOU, MY MOTHER?

02:55.567 --> 02:57.467
STARTING TODAY,
NO MORE SUGAR.

02:57.467 --> 03:00.300
INSTEAD, YOU'LL BE HAVING
6 SERVINGS OF FRUIT,

03:00.300 --> 03:02.300
6 SERVINGS OF VEGETABLES,
3 SERVINGS OF DAIRY,

03:02.300 --> 03:04.000
AND 2 SERVINGS OF
MEAT, FISH, OR POULTRY,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.600
OH, THAT SOUNDS EXPENSIVE.
I BETTER GO CUT
SOME COUPONS.

03:13.367 --> 03:16.100
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

03:16.100 --> 03:19.133
THEY BETTER MAKE
CHOCOLATE-COVERED
FISH AND VEGETABLES.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.800
MOM'S RIGHT, ZACK.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.500
THE EATING HABITS
WE DEVELOP AT OUR AGE

03:23.500 --> 03:25.600
ARE THE ONES THAT WILL
CARRY US THROUGH LIFE.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.300
I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU'RE NOT MY MOM.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.934
LOOK, I EAT A LOT
OF CHOCOLATE.

03:31.934 --> 03:34.300
WHAT'S THE WORST THING
THAT CAN HAPPEN?

03:34.300 --> 03:36.734
OH...

03:36.734 --> 03:38.967
CHEF PAOLO, WHAT'S WRONG?

03:38.967 --> 03:40.967
IT'S MY BLOOD TEST.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.867
IT DID NOT TURN OUT
SO GOOD.

03:42.867 --> 03:46.200
COME ON, CHEF.
HOW BAD CAN YOUR BLOOD BE?

03:46.200 --> 03:49.233
THEY FOUND BACON BITS.

03:49.233 --> 03:51.767
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CHANGE
YOUR EATING HABITS.

03:51.767 --> 03:54.300
ACCORDING TO THIS CHART,

03:54.300 --> 03:55.800
A MAN OF YOUR AGE
SHOULD TAKE IN

03:55.800 --> 03:58.100
ABOUT 2,200 CALORIES
A DAY.

03:58.100 --> 04:01.700
I EAT MORE THAN THAT
BEFORE BREAKFAST.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.233
SO STOP EATING BREAKFAST.

04:03.233 --> 04:06.033
I CAN'T. I'M A CHEF.

04:06.033 --> 04:08.667
LOOK AT MY HAT.

04:08.667 --> 04:11.400
I HAVE TO TASTE MY FOOD
TO MAKE SURE IT
TURNS OUT RIGHT.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.367
WELL, I'LL TASTE
YOUR FOOD FOR YOU.

04:13.367 --> 04:14.734
PLEASE.

04:14.734 --> 04:16.000
YOU DON'T TASTE.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.233
YOU INHALE.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.000
I'LL DO IT.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.867
THANK YOU,
MY LITTLE PROTEGé.

04:20.867 --> 04:22.700
IT'S SO KIND OF YOU
TO HELP ME ON MY DIET.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.667
WE WILL START NEXT WEEK.

04:24.667 --> 04:25.567
WHY NOT NOW?

04:25.567 --> 04:28.200
BECAUSE NOW, I'M HUNGRY.

04:29.567 --> 04:31.200
YOU SMELL CHOCOLATE?

04:31.200 --> 04:33.033
NO.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.367
MADDIE, I WANT YOU
TO MEET FRANCESCA.

04:39.367 --> 04:42.667
OH, THIS IS YOUR
POOR FRIEND.

04:42.667 --> 04:46.500
[Speaking slowly]
IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU.

04:47.700 --> 04:50.900
OK, PEOPLE, PICK OUT TWO
OF YOUR FAVORITE OUTFITS.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.467
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS ONE?

04:53.467 --> 04:54.700
OH, IT'S HIDEOUS.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.200
I THINK IT'S GORGEOUS.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.600
THANK YOU, BUT WE REALLY
DON'T NEED AN OPINION
FROM THE HELP.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.300
I'M NOT HELP.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.000
YOU'RE TELLING ME?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.200
I ORDERED A MOCHA FRAPPE
10 MINUTES AGO.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.300
AND NOTHING.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.700
OH, I'LL GIVE YOU A FRAPPE.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.133
LOOK FRAPPECHESCA,

05:16.133 --> 05:18.200
REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID
BEFORE YOU CAME HERE?

05:18.200 --> 05:21.100
WE CAN ONLY CRITICIZE
PEOPLE THAT WE PAY.

05:21.100 --> 05:24.200
FINE. YOUR BUTT IS HUGE.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.400
AND YOU HAVE CHICKEN LEGS.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.700
THAT'S THE BEST 50 BUCKS
I EVER SPENT.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.133
OK, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS,

05:33.133 --> 05:35.000
BUT SHE MAKES YOU LOOK SWEET.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.934
WHY DO YOU THINK
I HANG OUT WITH HER?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.700
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M TOO SKINNY, DO YOU?

05:41.700 --> 05:42.667
NO.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.900
MY BUTT'S NOT
TOO BIG, IS IT?

05:44.900 --> 05:46.400
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

05:54.033 --> 05:57.667
I THINK I'M GONNA GO FOR
A LITTLE 10-MILE JOG.

06:00.934 --> 06:02.467
I THINK I'M GOING TO GET

06:02.467 --> 06:03.767
A DOUBLE DOUBLE
CHEESEBURGER.

06:03.767 --> 06:05.033
WITH FRIES.

06:08.233 --> 06:09.600
AND A SHAKE.

06:12.734 --> 06:14.100
UH...

06:19.867 --> 06:21.233
VERY GOOD.

06:21.233 --> 06:23.133
YOU'RE SURE THERE'S
ENOUGH BUTTER?

06:23.133 --> 06:24.834
ENOUGH CREAM?

06:24.834 --> 06:26.734
I LOVE CREAM.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.200
SNAP OUT OF IT, BIG GUY.

06:28.200 --> 06:31.767
I DO THINK IT COULD USE
A LITTLE MORE PARMESAN.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.200
YOU GO GET IT.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.100
I DON'T TRUST MYSELF
ALONE WITH THE CHEESE.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.834
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE SOUP?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.300
I REDUCED IT?

06:50.734 --> 06:52.867
WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE YOU.

06:52.867 --> 06:54.033
I AM SORRY.

06:54.033 --> 06:55.567
OH, BY THE WAY,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

06:55.567 --> 06:58.400
IT DID NEED MORE
PARMESAN.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.600
CHEF, DROP IT.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.934
DROP IT.

07:03.700 --> 07:06.700
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S HARD
TO QUIT COLD TURKEY.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.734
COLD TURKEY.

07:08.734 --> 07:10.200
WITH HOT GRAVY.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.100
OH, MAMA MIA.

07:12.100 --> 07:15.133
ALL I'VE HAD SO FAR TODAY
IS A BABY CARROT

07:15.133 --> 07:16.600
AND 6 GLASSES OF WATER.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.600
I NEED FOOD. NOW!

07:18.600 --> 07:20.233
I JUST MADE A CHEESECAKE.

07:20.233 --> 07:22.000
DON'T YOU KNOW I'M DIETING?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.500
I NEED TO LOOK PERFECT
FOR MY FASHION SHOW.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.867
NOW FEED ME SOMETHING YUMMY
THAT MAKES ME SHRINK.

07:26.867 --> 07:29.400
OH, THE ETERNAL QUEST.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.800
THE DOUBLE FRIED CHICKEN
ALA PAOLO WAS GREAT.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.367
SO AM I STARTING TO GET
THAT FULL FIGURED LOOK?

07:37.367 --> 07:39.233
YOUR RIGHT HIP
LOOKS A LITTLE BIGGER.

07:39.233 --> 07:42.600
OOH! OH, WAIT.
THAT'S MY BUS PASS.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.200
WELL, I GUESS I BETTER
HAVE SOME DESSERT.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.600
WHAT YOU GOT?

07:46.600 --> 07:51.000
CHOCOLATE CHIP CHEESECAKE
WITH FUDGE SAUCE
ALA PAOLO.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.300
CODY, DOESN'T THIS
LOOK GREAT?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.600
AH!

08:14.500 --> 08:15.767
HERE.

08:16.834 --> 08:19.567
MMM. THANKS.

08:22.467 --> 08:24.734
YOU TWO SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

08:26.467 --> 08:27.734
CODY'S RIGHT.

08:27.734 --> 08:29.100
London: YEAH.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.834
THERE'S STILL SOME
CHOCOLATE LEFT
ON HIS FACE.

08:31.834 --> 08:34.233
LET'S LICK IT OFF.
YES!

08:35.600 --> 08:37.834
DIBS ON THE FOREHEAD.

08:37.834 --> 08:40.100
BACK OFF. BACK!

08:40.100 --> 08:43.100
I'M TELLING YOU,
I'M NOT AFRAID
TO USE THIS THING.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.600
MADELINE,
IT'S AWFULLY LATE.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.734
WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING HERE?

08:58.734 --> 08:59.767
THE FASHION SHOW'S TOMORROW,

08:59.767 --> 09:01.300
SO I'M STAYING WITH LONDON.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.233
I'M MAKING SURE
SHE DOESN'T EAT,

09:03.233 --> 09:05.000
AND SHE'S MAKING SURE I DO.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.200
WHY?

09:06.200 --> 09:08.033
WELL, I NEED TO FILL OUT
MY DRESS MORE,

09:08.033 --> 09:10.400
AND SHE NEEDS TO FILL OUT
HER DRESS LESS.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.033
THAT'S RIGHT.
LESS TALKING MORE CHEWING.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.233
RATS!

09:17.233 --> 09:18.700
OK, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.700
MADELINE,
PUT DOWN THE FOOD.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.500
LONDON, YOU NEED
TO STOP RIGHT NOW.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.000
OH, GIVE, GIVE, GIVE...

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
STOP, STOP, STOP.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.233
GIVE ME THAT BACK!

09:29.100 --> 09:32.033
LOOK, GIRLS,
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

09:32.033 --> 09:33.200
NOW, IF YOU WANT
ONE MAN'S OPINION,

09:33.200 --> 09:34.500
I THINK YOU ARE BOTH

09:34.500 --> 09:36.767
TWO VERY BEAUTIFUL
YOUNG WOMEN.

09:36.767 --> 09:38.834
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

09:38.834 --> 09:40.300
ABSOLUTELY.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.100
AND YOU DON'T NEED
TO CHANGE THE WAY
THAT YOU LOOK.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.200
THANKS, MOSEBY.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.400
YOU'RE THE BEST.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.400
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.133
GOOD NIGHT.

09:49.233 --> 09:50.600
HE'S GONE.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.100
I'M VERY PROUD
OF YOU, CHEF PAOLO.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.233
YOU MADE IT THROUGH
YOUR FIRST DAY

10:02.233 --> 10:04.133
WITHOUT CHEATING
ON YOUR DIET.

10:04.133 --> 10:05.500
THANKS TO YOU.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.000
AND IT WAS MUCH EASIER
THAN I THOUGH.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.100
WELL, GOTTA GO.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.600
WHAT'S THAT?

10:14.600 --> 10:17.300
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THAT
CHUB OF SALAMI GOT THERE.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.700
I SWEAR.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.300
LET ME GET THAT.

10:25.367 --> 10:27.934
WHO PUT THAT CHEESE
IN MY HAT?

10:28.767 --> 10:30.200
WHAT, NO DESSERT?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.800
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T PAT ME ON THE BUTT.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.934
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
CHEF PAOLO.

10:35.934 --> 10:37.700
YOU WERE DOING SO WELL.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.600
I'M WEAK.

10:39.600 --> 10:43.967
I'M WEAK.
AND THE WORST PART IS,

10:43.967 --> 10:47.600
I HAVE A REFRIGERATOR
AT HOME WITH A GIANT
HAM INSIDE.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.467
ALL NIGHT, SHE WILL BE
CALLING ME.

10:49.467 --> 10:52.500
PAOLO. PAOLO, COME TO ME.
