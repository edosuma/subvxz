WEBVTT

00:05.505 --> 00:07.223
Hey, grandpa, a little help.

00:07.424 --> 00:08.743
Here you go, sport.

00:09.467 --> 00:10.536
But call me "grandpa" again

00:10.719 --> 00:14.314
and you and I are gonna play a little
game called "hide the wingtip. "

00:14.597 --> 00:17.065
There might be a generational gap
here, I'll explain.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.139
The wingtip is my shoe,

00:19.352 --> 00:21.468
the hiding place is your ass.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.311
Hi, Bob.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.234
That's why I always save you a place.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.195
You keep the riff-raff in check.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.847
My pleasure.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.067
Well, let's see what Enid
packed for lunch today.

00:35.493 --> 00:38.132
A stapler and a golf ball.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.884
She's not well.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.436
Trade ya. My apple for your golf ball.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.578
Done.

00:45.962 --> 00:48.192
Maggie, how long has your foot
been like that?

00:51.051 --> 00:54.964
Nurse Turkleton, I want you to take
good care of my friend Maggie here.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.035
Don't worry, we'll take care of you.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.363
Name and insurance, please.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.120
Maggie Kent and none.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.058
All right, let's find her a room.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.502
<i>When a patient
doesn't have insurance,</i>

01:07.692 --> 01:09.250
<i>you have to work around the system.</i>

01:09.527 --> 01:11.643
<i>First you have to find someone
who's recently died.</i>

01:11.863 --> 01:14.218
Cool, Mr Rabinowitz just kicked it.

01:15.533 --> 01:18.605
Oh, don't worry, he put his peep
in an electrical socket.

01:18.870 --> 01:19.859
You can't do that.

01:21.831 --> 01:23.947
<i>Then you have to convince the
morgue guy to sit on the paperwork</i>

01:24.167 --> 01:25.919
<i>so the deceased's bed stays open.</i>

01:26.127 --> 01:27.116
Deal.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.817
<i>Then you have to get the floor nurses
to play along.</i>

01:30.882 --> 01:33.476
Enjoy your kosher meal,
Mr Rabinowitz.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.044
<i>Then you have to find a surgeon
to do the work pro bono.</i>

01:37.305 --> 01:39.580
Dude, I've had a pro bono,
like, all morning.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.283
Something-might-be-wrong five.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.097
I got this one.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.260
<i>But, most importantly,</i>

01:46.439 --> 01:49.670
<i>you can't let any higher-ups
find out that a patient is uninsured,</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:53.015
<i>even if they're the ones
who brought her here in the first place.</i>

01:53.279 --> 01:56.476
Bob, I want to thank you for doing all
this, even though I don't have any...

01:56.741 --> 01:59.096
Dr Kelso, we need to talk to you.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.310
What is it?

02:01.746 --> 02:04.419
We want to go somewhere with you.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.277
Okay. Where?

02:06.584 --> 02:07.653
A spa.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.648
We'd like to get some massages.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.101
Well, I know just the place.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.820
Great, now I've got a crick in my neck.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.443
We're gonna get a little graphic here,

02:23.643 --> 02:27.522
so you fellas might want to look
the other way, or not, it's your choice.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.635
Turk, why are you looking?

02:30.817 --> 02:32.694
It's my neck crick. I can't move.

02:32.902 --> 02:33.971
Watch this, Turkleton.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.714
She calls it the "Shanghai Surprise. "

02:36.948 --> 02:38.381
Oh, God.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.144
Oh!

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.802 --> 03:00.760
Okay, Maggie, as soon as your labs
come back, we'll prep you for surgery.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.130
You two are my guardian angels.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.311
Hey, good morning, fellas.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.714
- Sir, how are you? Lookin' good.
- What's happening with you?

03:08.938 --> 03:10.257
Why so awkward?

03:10.440 --> 03:13.273
You never saw a colleague
get a happy ending before?

03:13.526 --> 03:14.754
No, not that happy.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.094
But thank you for including us.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.119
Oh, say, Barbie, wait just a second.

03:19.324 --> 03:23.397
I gotta tell you, you look...
Well, darn it all, you look great today.

03:23.703 --> 03:24.738
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.904
I started using that new facial cream
made from baby foreskins.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.476
- Oh!
- But I don't understand.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.419
You haven't complimented me
in six years.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.616
Why today?

03:31.795 --> 03:34.070
Well, since you're
a private practise doctor

03:34.297 --> 03:35.525
who went home yesterday at 5:00,

03:35.715 --> 03:38.104
leaving me up all night
with your melanoma patient,

03:38.343 --> 03:40.140
I just knew if I complimented you,

03:40.345 --> 03:43.098
sure as shootin' you'd look at me
just a hair too long,

03:43.348 --> 03:44.827
and then this would happen.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.861
Oh, you think you're funny?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.815
I do. I always have,
ever since I was little.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.696
It's one of the reasons
that I'm a winner.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.052
I'm in a hurry.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.193
I promised one of my patients

03:59.364 --> 04:00.877
that I would meet him for his first day
of drug counselling.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.189
See? I wrote it right here.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.085
Oh, Barboo, gimme a break.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.434
Why in God's name do you think

04:05.620 --> 04:07.292
I'd care about anything
that you wrote down?

04:07.497 --> 04:09.089
You wouldn't.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.245
Ha!

04:10.417 --> 04:12.214
Nice!

04:13.628 --> 04:16.745
Hey, can you believe
who the new drug counsellor is?

04:17.589 --> 04:20.866
I just want you all to know that
I've been right where you are.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.694
Hell, a couple of years ago

04:22.887 --> 04:24.320
I was in this very hospital,

04:24.514 --> 04:27.472
scamming that nice doctor over there
for painkillers.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.455
Can everyone say hi to Dr Reid?

04:30.145 --> 04:31.703
Hi, Doctor Reid.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.136
Hey, drug addicts!

04:33.314 --> 04:34.713
What's up?

04:36.735 --> 04:40.091
Girl, can you believe what they sell
in these white people magazines?

04:40.363 --> 04:41.398
Look here.

04:41.573 --> 04:45.088
This is a computer chip that you put in
your baby's foot, so you can track it.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.437
Like a baby LoJack.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.894
Yeah, white people do
the craziest things.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.794
Like bumper stickers.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.194
I don't give a damn what you brake for.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.260
I know. White people...

04:57.839 --> 05:02.196
No... No, my step-mom is one-quarter
Inuit, so I'm part Eskimo.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.341
Anyway, small favour.
I need your baby.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.987
I'm getting into
the baby broker business.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.092
Nothing illicit, I'm just hooking up folks

05:08.308 --> 05:11.027
that can't have babies
with folks that don't want babies.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.066
You, leave.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.005
You, give me that baby
LoJack number.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.711
Already tore it out.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.923
Hey.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.024
Babe, where were you?

05:24.240 --> 05:25.878
We were supposed to meet
for breakfast.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.032
My bad. I was hanging out with J.D.
and Rowdy,

05:28.244 --> 05:31.156
and we decided to pull a prank
that we used to do back in the day.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.565
Here comes Ted!

05:34.751 --> 05:36.389
Go, go, go, pull!

05:36.920 --> 05:39.593
<i>I love you, love you</i>

05:47.263 --> 05:49.731
Ghost dog!

05:58.900 --> 06:00.174
Calm down, people.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.635
We have a back-up generator.

06:04.864 --> 06:05.899
Thank God.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.905
I was just bluffing.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.026
We won't be doing that again.

06:11.246 --> 06:14.044
Ted, look at this budget!

06:14.541 --> 06:17.738
I've got half a notion to make you pay
for every cent of that new transformer.

06:18.837 --> 06:22.466
I'm telling you, sir, a lifeless ghost dog

06:22.757 --> 06:26.830
glided in front of my car
wearing roller skates.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.957
If this is your way of trying to make me

06:30.181 --> 06:31.933
feel guilty about paving over that

06:32.142 --> 06:34.258
Indian burial ground,
it isn't going to work.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.752
We needed the damn parking spaces!

06:37.022 --> 06:41.777
Now, why in the hell are we paying
this much money for scrubs?

06:42.652 --> 06:44.802
Maybe people are stealing them.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.710
Now, why would people
be stealing scrubs?

06:51.161 --> 06:52.355
Hey, Mom.

06:52.537 --> 06:56.689
A guy tried to die on me today,
but I didn't let him.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.115
I didn't let him.

06:58.835 --> 07:02.623
<i>What a friend we have in Jesus</i>

07:11.139 --> 07:13.607
Excuse me, guys, stealing scrubs here.

07:14.851 --> 07:18.207
So, anyway, I've been an addict
since I was 14.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.916
About a year ago, I realised it was time
to wake up and get sober.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.069
So, you finally just hit rock bottom.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.268
No, no, no. I hit a cop.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.400
But anyway,
since I wasn't willing to do the things,

07:29.657 --> 07:33.206
you know, you need to do in jail
to get narcotics,

07:33.495 --> 07:36.487
at least not enthusiastically,
I... I got clean.

07:36.748 --> 07:37.976
I have a game.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.634
Raise your hand if you're full of crap.

07:40.877 --> 07:44.711
Sam, if you don't raise your hand,
you're going to lose the game.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.325
Come on, man.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.976
You don't know how hard it's been
to stay straight.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.130
Been there, brother.

07:58.311 --> 08:02.224
Turk, you know I hate that damn dog!

08:02.941 --> 08:05.899
No, it's not bald, black doctor.

08:06.194 --> 08:11.951
It's haired, half-white, half-Inuit Janitor,
and this is the real Rowdy.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.686
Excuse me?

08:13.868 --> 08:16.541
You recall a couple years ago,
you lost him?

08:17.372 --> 08:18.600
Woof-woof.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.509
<i>You were panicked that your husband
was gonna find out,</i>

08:21.710 --> 08:24.782
<i>so I sold
my entire stuffed squirrel army</i>

08:25.046 --> 08:28.083
<i>in exchange for Stephen,
an exact replica.</i>

08:28.925 --> 08:33.520
What you don't know is that I retraced
your steps that day and I found Rowdy.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.705
Now, I think if your husband knew that

08:35.890 --> 08:40.839
he'd been loving a fake dead dog
all this time, he'd be very unhappy.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.539
You're a crazy person.

08:42.731 --> 08:43.720
Am I?

08:44.149 --> 08:45.468
Or am I a brilliant mastermind

08:45.650 --> 08:48.960
who's waited two long years until
he needed something from you?

08:49.237 --> 08:50.829
And now that day has come.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.669
Here's what I want.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.994
I want your baby.
We already talked about that.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.796
I want you to tell that
new borderline anorexic nurse

08:59.039 --> 09:02.111
to eat a sandwich and then
to go salsa dancing with me.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.597
Also, I want you to teach me
to salsa dance.

09:04.753 --> 09:08.428
I want a pound of frankincense,
mostly just to see what it is.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.819
And, lastly, I'm in a little bit of a tiff with
the main barista down at Coffee Bucks.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.206
He's not above poisoning me,

09:15.388 --> 09:18.505
so I'm gonna need you to be
my official beverage taster. Yes?

09:18.975 --> 09:21.091
I'm just gonna confess everything
to Turk.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.778
No, easy, boy, we'll get her.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.582
Why can't you just give Sam a break?

09:31.780 --> 09:34.817
Look, the only thing Sam did was to go
from being a lying drug addict,

09:35.075 --> 09:37.270
to being a lying drug addict
who works here.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.563
People change.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.543
I knew this one migrant worker
from our orchard, Ramon.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.269
He used to say, "I hate applesauce.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.097
<i>"It destroys the integrity
of the la manzana. "</i>

09:46.336 --> 09:48.167
<i>Manzana's Spanish for "apple. "
Anyway.</i>

09:48.380 --> 09:50.530
Last time I was home,
I asked how Ramon was doing.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.146
Vice President of Mott's Applesauce.

09:53.385 --> 09:56.582
It's true, Ramon Delgado,
look him up on the Internet.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.245
- I will.
- Don't, I made it up.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.262
The point is, people can change
and you know it.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.147
Nothing ever changes.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.678
The artist formerly known as Prince
is still just Prince.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.488
My ex-wife is still pretty much my wife.

10:09.901 --> 10:13.450
<i>Grey's Anatomy always wraps up every
episode with some cheesy voiceover</i>

10:13.738 --> 10:16.127
that ties together all of
the storylines, which,

10:16.366 --> 10:18.880
incidentally, is my least favourite
device on television.

10:19.119 --> 10:24.273
Newbie continually will try to violate
my "no touching" policy.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.051
Uh-huh.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.538
And Republicans will forever
try to raise...

10:29.754 --> 10:30.948
Sneak hug!

10:32.590 --> 10:34.387
Of course, I would go kill him right now,

10:34.592 --> 10:36.947
but he actually just helped
to prove my point.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.930
This is gonna help, too.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.699
There are 10 orders of Percocet
missing from the pharmacy.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.082
Well, I think I have a pretty good idea

10:43.268 --> 10:45.862
who I'm gonna give
my complimentary urine test to.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.034
So, how bad is it gonna be?

10:52.277 --> 10:53.596
You're gonna lose the dead tissue,

10:53.778 --> 10:57.487
but, thanks to modern medicine,
you're gonna keep most of your foot.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.771
You wouldn't believe how much worse

10:58.950 --> 11:01.703
it would have been
even a few years ago.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.646
This might hurteth a little.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.973
Look, milady, I know it stinks that

11:10.211 --> 11:12.406
we're removing your foot
and plan to eat it tonight

11:12.630 --> 11:15.098
at the Healing Feast,
but you wouldn't believeth

11:15.342 --> 11:19.779
how much worse this would have been
even a few years ago.

11:44.454 --> 11:47.810
I may have killed you,
but I think I was upset about it.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.224
Listen up, people! Gather round.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.193
Not you, Mr Miller. Staff only.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.699
All right, this is going to be very simple.

11:58.927 --> 12:02.476
Whoever has been stealing scrubs
is going to raise their hand,

12:02.764 --> 12:05.232
pay the hospital back
and be immediately fired.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.837
Let's see 'em.

12:08.061 --> 12:11.770
Okay, you people leave me no choice.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.920
There, now you all have to wear scrubs

12:19.197 --> 12:21.506
so hideous that no one
would steal them.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.255
You brought this on yourselves,
you thieving bastards.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.927
Turk, I need to talk to you
about Rowdy...

12:26.121 --> 12:27.440
Okay, wait. Before you say anything,

12:27.622 --> 12:30.295
sorry I skipped out on breakfast
to goof around with Rowdy,

12:30.542 --> 12:32.055
but you gotta understand,

12:32.252 --> 12:34.891
Rowdy is more than just a dead toy
to J.D. and me.

12:35.130 --> 12:38.247
We got him together in college
and he's always been there.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.547
The key to the salsa is passion.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.912
And spin!

12:48.309 --> 12:51.984
There were no drugs in Sam's bag
and his urinalysis came back clean.

12:52.897 --> 12:53.966
Don't beat yourself up, big guy.

12:54.149 --> 12:56.458
I would have suspected me, too.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.475
Maybe we should post the transcript

12:58.653 --> 13:00.450
for your "nothing ever changes" rant

13:00.655 --> 13:03.692
in the cancer ward for the chemo
patients as a little pick-me-up.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.942
<i>Oh, and FYI, I happen to like
the voiceovers on Grey's Anatomy,</i>

13:07.203 --> 13:10.559
except for when
they're really vague and generic.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.284
<i>And so, in the end,</i>

13:12.459 --> 13:14.177
<i>I knew what Elliot said about
the way things were</i>

13:14.377 --> 13:18.575
<i>had forever changed
the way we all thought about them.</i>

13:20.550 --> 13:22.108
I actually don't mind the new scrubs.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.621
It really makes my outfit pop.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.910
Look, I know that you feel stupid
for falsely accusing Sam,

13:28.141 --> 13:30.291
but it all goes away
if you just apologise to him.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.032
Way ahead of you on that score,
Barboo.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.909
I wanted to surprise the gentleman

13:35.106 --> 13:37.336
with something I thought
he'd really enjoy,

13:37.567 --> 13:40.127
so I went out and got him a brick
of heroin shaped like a heart.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.081
Now, if I could just find him
a funny card.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.218
If you really thought he was
still a drug addict,

13:45.408 --> 13:46.523
you wouldn't let him counsel people.

13:46.701 --> 13:47.770
Of course I would.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.704
Addicts make the very best counsellors

13:49.913 --> 13:52.711
because they know just exactly
what druggies are going through,

13:52.957 --> 13:56.586
mainly because,
and see if you can follow this,

13:56.878 --> 14:00.268
they're currently going through it, too.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.790
I don't care what you think.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.685
I'm always gonna believe in people.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.114
All the best with that, Barbidiot.

14:08.306 --> 14:11.901
You brought these caca-coloured
scrubs on yourselves, folks,

14:12.185 --> 14:15.336
and thanks for playing along
with that hideous suit, Ted.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.493
Playing along with what, sir?

14:17.691 --> 14:19.522
Nothing. Looking sharp.

14:19.776 --> 14:20.925
Wow.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.684
See? It's fine.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.944
Nobody's trying to poison...

14:30.036 --> 14:31.264
I knew it!

14:31.955 --> 14:32.944
She's gone.

14:33.123 --> 14:36.240
Oh, boy, someone's gonna
have to tell black doctor.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.647
I do not want that job.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.449
Zombie!

14:41.798 --> 14:43.117
I can't do this any more.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.448
I'm out.

14:44.634 --> 14:45.669
What?

14:45.844 --> 14:47.402
Oh, no, no, toots.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.434
You're out when I say you're out!

14:49.639 --> 14:51.197
I saw that, Frank.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.238
Here's the deal.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.658
When nobody's looking,

14:56.855 --> 14:58.732
we grab Stephen
and make him go bye-bye.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.658
Then there will only be one dog left.

15:00.859 --> 15:03.896
So, when Lurch suddenly shows up
with the real Rowdy,

15:04.154 --> 15:07.066
Turk will have to assume that he's
the one who stole him from the car.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.438
Got it?

15:08.616 --> 15:09.685
Whatever.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.267
Let's do this.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.414
Laverne Roberts!

15:15.415 --> 15:18.725
Laverne, I got the keys right here.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.465
Well, tuna fish on a sponge.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.028
She's getting closer.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.366
Hey, Bob.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.996
Hey, Maggie.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.113
I thought we were gonna take care
of that foot.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.468
I don't have insurance.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.882
It's okay, I can get by.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.867
<i>Everyone reacts differently
to unpleasant discoveries.</i>

15:43.109 --> 15:44.508
<i>Some people get angry.</i>

15:44.694 --> 15:46.013
Save my seat.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.869
<i>Others are admittedly
a tad more dramatic.</i>

15:49.199 --> 15:50.598
Oh, my God, he's gone.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.058
I think I'm gonna be sick.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.642
I never got the chance to tell him
I loved him.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.666
I mean, guys,
I know all about bottoming out.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.263
All right? It wasn't long ago
that I was out there,

16:00.460 --> 16:03.532
on my knees,
praying to the gods for help.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.946
- God, please!
- Lord!

16:06.132 --> 16:07.645
- Please, God!
- Please, God!

16:07.842 --> 16:09.639
- Bring him back.
- Why?

16:09.844 --> 16:12.119
Bring back our Rowdy!

16:12.347 --> 16:13.541
That was weird.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.953
Okay, why don't we call it a day, okay?
Okay, guys?

16:16.184 --> 16:18.300
Proud of you, proud of you,
proud of you, proud of you.

16:23.191 --> 16:26.501
Are you... Are you seriously doing
the cliched sarcastic slow clap?

16:26.778 --> 16:28.609
Because that is way too 1980s.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.540
It was a hell of a performance.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.492
The attitude, the indignation.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.657
It was damn near believable,
do you know that?

16:34.869 --> 16:38.339
Honestly, I don't really feel the need
to convince you of anything,

16:38.623 --> 16:42.298
but I will say that if you're waiting
to watch me slip,

16:42.585 --> 16:45.224
I think things are gonna get really
frustrating for you.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.181
Let me tell you something, man.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.259
This guy is amazing, okay?

16:49.676 --> 16:50.791
He's unbelievable.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.004
To even get into his class,

16:52.178 --> 16:56.456
you have to bring any drugs you have
at home so you're not tempted.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.119
Let's see if I've got this right.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.903
You have to give your drugs to him?

17:01.730 --> 17:03.209
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.433
Oh, that reminds me.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.676
Uh, I found these in my dryer.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.683
Thank you, Lloyd. Thank you.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.278
He's doing very well.

17:16.493 --> 17:19.406
Even I have to admit,
that was pretty darn clever.

17:19.664 --> 17:20.779
Thanks.

17:21.249 --> 17:22.318
I came up with it
when I was shooting up

17:22.500 --> 17:24.377
with my sponsor in the back
of his El Camino.

17:24.586 --> 17:25.814
Crazy!

17:26.921 --> 17:28.673
I'm gonna go ahead
and take this whole moment,

17:28.882 --> 17:34.240
I'm gonna find Dr Barbie
and I'm going to rub it in her face.

17:39.434 --> 17:40.628
Well, howdy, boys!

17:40.810 --> 17:42.038
'Member me?

17:42.228 --> 17:43.297
Ghost dog!

17:43.480 --> 17:44.708
Ghost dog!

17:45.690 --> 17:47.293
You forced my hand.

17:47.442 --> 17:48.716
Gimme that!

17:49.152 --> 17:50.824
How dare you steal our dog?

17:51.029 --> 17:53.543
- Huh?
- Sorry, you lose, bye-bye.

17:53.782 --> 17:56.774
Oh, and you should still have someone
check your coffee before you drink it.

18:04.668 --> 18:05.987
Squid oil.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.569
That's one for you, Frank.

18:09.214 --> 18:12.251
Barbie, I have the most exciting news
to tell you!

18:12.592 --> 18:13.627
What the hell, people?

18:13.802 --> 18:15.394
I just saw Maggie Kent in the park.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.630
Why didn't we treat her?

18:16.805 --> 18:18.079
She has no insurance.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.492
Well, why didn't we do
what we always do?

18:19.683 --> 18:22.914
Why didn't you fix it while I turned
my back and pretend not to notice?

18:23.186 --> 18:24.175
You know the dance.

18:24.354 --> 18:25.309
We used to,

18:25.480 --> 18:27.710
but if you're gonna threaten to fire us
over taking a pair of scrubs,

18:27.941 --> 18:30.933
why wouldn't we think you'd fire us
for treating an uninsured patient?

18:31.569 --> 18:33.321
Yeah, when you took away the scrubs,
you took away the trust,

18:33.530 --> 18:36.203
and without trust, everything falls apart.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.905
<i>And just like that,
we got our old scrubs back.</i>

18:48.461 --> 18:52.249
I'm telling you guys, this could have
been a much bigger moment.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.594
<i>Even though I was the only one
who knew how to embrace life,</i>

18:55.844 --> 18:59.280
<i>we all left thinking about
how important trust is.</i>

19:00.140 --> 19:03.849
<i>Dr Cox let Elliot keep her trust
in humankind a while longer.</i>

19:04.144 --> 19:09.662
I... I just wanted to apologise to you,
Sam, for not believing in you.

19:11.443 --> 19:12.922
Thanks.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.368
Well, why didn't you tell her?

19:16.740 --> 19:18.173
'Cause this hospital will eventually

19:18.366 --> 19:20.926
make her just as cynical
as everybody else in the dump.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.470
She didn't need my help on that one.

19:23.705 --> 19:27.459
By the way, do me a favour.
If you do use later, don't drive.

19:29.461 --> 19:30.974
- I take the bus, dude.
- Yeah.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.890
<i>Carla protected the trust that we have
in her by coming clean.</i>

19:34.132 --> 19:35.326
Anyway, I should have told you guys

19:35.508 --> 19:39.023
I lost him back then, but, hopefully,
this'll help you forgive me.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.293
Whoa!

19:41.139 --> 19:43.289
Look at them standing next
to each other.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.347
Two beautiful dead dogs.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.869
Now, at least, you can both have one.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.583
I'm cool with keeping Stephen.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.047
We've gotten to know each other
quite well.

19:51.232 --> 19:54.065
Well, how are we supposed to know
who's who?

19:55.028 --> 19:57.098
That's Stephen.
Don't ask me how I know that.

19:58.490 --> 20:02.802
<i>As for Dr Kelso, he knew that trusting
us again was probably foolish.</i>

20:03.828 --> 20:05.386
Good night, sir.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.038
<i>Still, it was worth it.</i>

20:12.253 --> 20:14.050
You want half my sandwich?

20:14.255 --> 20:16.086
Thank you, Mrs Suarez.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.039
It's Kent, Bob.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.049
- Maggie...
- Shhh!

20:20.261 --> 20:21.740
Thank you.
