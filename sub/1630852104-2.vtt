[Michael] I just spoke to Neil,
who's calling a couple of your colleagues

02:17.250 --> 02:19.375

told me last night

that they would be there the same time.

that no one was coming.

It depends how liquid the situation is.

02:37.833 --> 02:39.625
Use it all.

02:39.708 --> 02:42.416
Well, in other words,
if we tell it like it is,

02:42.500 --> 02:44.625
then we've got a very good documentary.

02:44.708 --> 02:45.708
But if--

02:45.791 --> 02:47.083
We're hiding.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.625
[Michael] If we're hiding,
then we don't have much of a documentary.

02:49.708 --> 02:53.416

04:09.666 --> 04:12.333
He, A, said he'd call me back at 11:15.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.958
Then when I arrived back RS was here.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.125
[Paul] And PM was on his way.

04:19.208 --> 04:21.125

Good morning, Glyn.

-[Ringo] Did you get in touch with John?
-I couldn't get him.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.166
I don't know.

04:36.916 --> 04:38.791
Mal couldn't get him either.
You can only get the machine.

04:42.916 --> 04:46.125
[Linda] 'Cause I have a feeling that
half the stuff Yoko said yesterday isn't--

04:46.208 --> 04:48.125
She was talking for John.

04:48.208 --> 04:51.958
And I don't think he really
believed any of that, you know?

04:52.541 --> 04:53.416
No, so, it's--

04:53.500 --> 04:56.791
John didn't talk, so Yoko talked for John.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.291
In the middle of all that, actually…

05:03.458 --> 05:05.916
See, but their point is
that they're trying to,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.166
like, be as near together as they can.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.125
They wanna stay together, those two.

05:11.208 --> 05:13.125
So it's all right.
Let the young lovers stay together.

05:13.208 --> 05:14.750
But it's not that bad, you know.

05:14.833 --> 05:18.875

Funny enough,
the other day when we were talking,

05:40.625 --> 05:43.666
John had said that he really did not want
not to be a Beatle.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.791
Yes.

05:49.625 --> 05:50.875
-Oh, yeah. Sure.
-Are you--

05:50.958 --> 05:53.166
We'd cooled it
because we were not playing together.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.916
'Cause we lived together
when we played together.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.166
We were in the same hotel,

05:57.250 --> 05:59.333
up at the same time
every morning, all day.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.916
As long as you're this close all day,
so something grows.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.833
And then when you're not this close,
just physically, something goes.

06:05.916 --> 06:07.000
Right.

06:07.083 --> 06:11.041
[Paul] Actually, musically, we can play
better than we've ever been able to play.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.333
You know, we're all right on that.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.333
It's just that being together thing.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.125
It's difficult starting right from scratch
with Yoko there.

06:18.208 --> 06:20.791
'Cause I start out writing songs
about white walls.

06:20.875 --> 06:21.875
-[laughing]
-Just 'cause I--

06:21.958 --> 06:25.291
You know, just 'cause
I think John and Yoko would like that.

06:25.375 --> 06:26.541
And they wouldn't.

06:31.458 --> 06:34.916
So, I just think
it's just silly of me or anyone

06:35.000 --> 06:37.416
to try and say to 'em, "No, you can't."

06:37.500 --> 06:41.958
It's like-- It's like that we're striking
'cause work conditions aren't right.

06:42.041 --> 06:43.666
But it shouldn't be.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.708
"Can't operate under these conditions,
boy. We're coming out."

06:47.291 --> 06:49.958
It's like they're going overboard
about it.

06:50.041 --> 06:51.416
But John always does, you know.

06:51.500 --> 06:55.208
You can't go saying, "Be sensible about it
and don't bring her to meetings."

06:55.708 --> 06:57.375
It's his decision, that.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.791
It's none of our business,
like, interfering in that.

07:05.541 --> 07:07.583
Well, I think for them
to be able to compromise,

07:07.666 --> 07:09.666
I have to be able to compromise first.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.000
Then they'll be able to.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.833
But it's silly,
neither of us compromising.

07:14.458 --> 07:16.041
We probably do need…

07:17.333 --> 07:19.666
really, sort of a central daddy figure

07:19.750 --> 07:24.458
to say, you know, "Nine o'clock,
leave your girls at home, lads."

07:24.541 --> 07:25.708
You know, we're all…

07:28.125 --> 07:34.541
But it's gonna be such an incredible sort
of comical thing, like, in 50 years' time.

"They broke up 'cause Yoko sat on an amp."

07:38.833 --> 07:41.625

08:25.208 --> 08:27.041
on what our communal life is gonna be

08:27.125 --> 08:29.208
in the next two weeks,
what are we all betting?

08:29.291 --> 08:31.750
We should cancel that 18th day.

08:31.833 --> 08:34.250
'Cause it should definitely be the 19th.

08:34.875 --> 08:37.291
I mean, already,
'cause we're gonna lose today.

08:37.375 --> 08:40.041
I think we see the end of this week out

08:40.125 --> 08:43.000
and something will have happened,
definitely.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.375
[Michael] Even if it's only nothing?

08:44.458 --> 08:50.083
I was talking to Neil last night
about an idea I thought of for a TV show.

08:50.166 --> 08:54.250
We should get, like, say,
the editor of <i>The Daily Mirror</i>,

08:55.333 --> 09:01.208
a real hard news nut, rehearsing a team
of really hard, incredible newsmen.

09:01.833 --> 09:06.000
So that on the night of the show,
in between all our songs is news,

09:06.083 --> 09:09.208
but the fastest and the hottest
from every corner of the Earth.

09:09.291 --> 09:11.375
"We just heard there's been
an earthquake"… filming it.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.625
So it's like a red-hot news program.

09:14.166 --> 09:18.291
And at the end, the final bulletin is
that The Beatles have broken up.

09:21.208 --> 09:23.875
[Michael] But do you think
if you put any pressure on him,

09:23.958 --> 09:25.958
that he'd go your way a bit more?

09:26.708 --> 09:28.041
I don't know.

10:06.375 --> 10:10.125
-Speak to John? Yeah, okay.

I'd be staring at them.

Yeah, not only them, you know,
and they were 40 miles away.

10:18.791 --> 10:20.791
But the audience, the screams,
the lights--

10:20.875 --> 10:23.041
Look, we looked at <i>Help!</i>
the other night again

10:23.125 --> 10:26.041
and, like, <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>,
and that was them playing.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.250
Right. But it was them
over an hour and a half--

to Linda when you were out

10:50.041 --> 10:52.458
that I can do it any way,

10:52.541 --> 10:56.291
except I gotta keep saying you're wrong
when I think you're wrong.

10:56.875 --> 10:59.083
Yeah. Sure. Great.

10:59.166 --> 11:01.000
I'll just keep saying I'm right
when I think I'm right.

11:01.083 --> 11:02.333

29:43.500 --> 29:46.375
[John] Well, if we ask him really nicely,

29:46.458 --> 29:49.333
-he'll probably do a number five.
-[Peter] Yes, I might.

29:49.416 --> 29:50.416
[chuckles]

29:51.458 --> 29:53.291
[John] Long, tall Sally, pretty sweet.

29:53.375 --> 29:56.416
She got everything Uncle John need.
Oh, boy. Baby.

29:58.083 --> 30:00.416
Your chance to win a fab, free Beatle.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.541
-[Paul chuckles]
-Send in 39 disk tops.

30:05.541 --> 30:08.708
-[Paul] Wake up, Lennon.
-[John] Wake up, Lennon. It's about time.

30:10.125 --> 30:13.250
What, uh-- What are we discussing
at this moment? What's the, uh…

30:13.333 --> 30:14.791
-[Paul] The film.
-[Yoko] Issue. [chuckles]

30:14.875 --> 30:15.875
Ah.

30:16.833 --> 30:18.250
This is the impromptu mic.

30:18.333 --> 30:20.125
It's a documentary
of how The Beatles work.

30:20.208 --> 30:23.083
[Michael] It's a spontaneous--
A spontaneous documentary.

30:23.166 --> 30:25.208
'Cause we feel we shouldn't
keep it all to ourselves.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.500
We should spread it out, you know?

30:27.583 --> 30:31.541
We want to share
with the world what we have, Peter.

30:31.625 --> 30:35.541
-And-- And this is what we have.
-[Yoko] Or what we haven't. [chuckles]

30:35.625 --> 30:37.083
[Peter] Ah.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.833
[Paul] Well, this is--
we just sort of sit here

30:38.916 --> 30:40.583
and allow ourselves to be embarrassed

30:40.666 --> 30:43.083
-about this time every day.
-[chuckles]

30:43.166 --> 30:45.541
-[John] Oh, yes.
-[Paul] Number nine.

30:45.625 --> 30:50.208
You're talking to the ninth-best-dressed
male pop singer in the world, you know?

30:50.291 --> 30:53.708
-No mean city. Yes.
-[Paul] And Judy Garland.

30:54.625 --> 30:56.625
Look out, Tom Jones, I say.

30:56.708 --> 30:58.333
-[chuckles]
-Over to you, Peter.

31:00.916 --> 31:03.458
Very kind of you, but I-- I must be off.

31:05.125 --> 31:06.125
Mm-hmm.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.416
Well, nice to have met you, fellas.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.541
Other guys.

31:10.625 --> 31:11.625
-See you.
-[John] Bye-bye.

31:11.708 --> 31:12.708
-Bye.
-[Paul] Too much, Pete.

31:12.791 --> 31:14.500
-Bye-bye.
-[chuckles]

31:14.583 --> 31:16.125
-Way out.
-All right.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.208
-[Peter] All right. Way out.
-[Joe] Exit.

31:18.291 --> 31:20.041
-It's that way.
-Yeah, wrong way.

31:20.125 --> 31:21.541
It's that way. [chuckles]

31:21.625 --> 31:23.541
-[all chuckling]
-All right.

31:23.625 --> 31:26.166
[John]
Just don't leave the needles lying around.

31:26.250 --> 31:30.250
We've got a bad reputation now
with John getting busted and that.

31:30.333 --> 31:32.416
-[Peter, indistinct]
-[Yoko chuckles]

31:32.500 --> 31:35.083
-[Michael] Do you really not feel well?
-No, I just feel a bit--

31:35.166 --> 31:37.833
I don't feel well, but I can't say,
'cause I'm the captain of the ship.

31:37.916 --> 31:39.791
[John]
Nowadays, the captain gets off first.

31:40.750 --> 31:42.291
No, I'd go down with the ship.

31:43.125 --> 31:46.000
[Paul] If we hang around a bit longer,
we'll get Ringo being sick.

31:47.083 --> 31:49.958
[John] See you missed me this morning.
I did it for CBS.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.083
-Leapt off in the middle of the interview.
-Did you?

31:52.166 --> 31:54.750
Actually I'm just recovering from the day,
you know?

31:55.875 --> 31:57.541
[Yoko] From the night.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.541
[John] No reason at all,
except that I'm mistreating my body.

32:01.583 --> 32:04.625
Yes. I just was up late, you know.

32:04.708 --> 32:07.083
I was sort of stoned and high
and watching films.

32:07.166 --> 32:08.666
And I wouldn't have made it anyway.

32:08.750 --> 32:11.083
Is there any need to do this in public,
Mr. Lennon?

32:11.166 --> 32:12.958
[Michael]
At the moment you're a guest for lunch.

32:13.041 --> 32:14.250
Yeah. But it's not good.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.208
If I'm gonna come at 10:00
I should come at 10:00.

32:17.291 --> 32:19.166
[Paul] Up with the dawn,
down with the sun.

32:19.708 --> 32:21.375
Ringo ever, Eric never.

32:21.458 --> 32:22.458
Okay.

32:23.041 --> 32:24.541
Shall we knock off early today, or not?

32:24.625 --> 32:25.750
[Paul] Probably, yeah.

32:25.833 --> 32:27.791
[Michael]
Shall we knock on early tomorrow?

32:29.500 --> 32:30.875
Yes, I'll do that.

32:32.583 --> 32:33.583
Yeah.

32:33.666 --> 32:35.791
[John] "When I was younger,
so much younger than today,

32:35.875 --> 32:38.583
I never needed anybody's help in any way.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.916
But now my life has changed
in oh so many ways."

32:45.208 --> 32:48.000
A wop-bop-a-loo-ma. Ba-lim-bam-boo.

32:50.166 --> 32:52.250
We can't carry on like this indefinitely.

32:52.750 --> 32:54.291
-[Ringo] We seem to be.
-[Paul] Doing this.

32:54.375 --> 32:55.791
We seem to, but we can't.

32:57.125 --> 33:00.250
See, what you need
is a serious program of work.

33:01.291 --> 33:05.000
Not an aimless rambling
amongst the canyons of your mind.

33:06.958 --> 33:08.125
An aim in life.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.083
Trip upon that golden ship of shores.

33:12.333 --> 33:13.583
We all together, boy.

33:13.666 --> 33:16.625
To wander aimlessly is very un-swinging.

33:19.500 --> 33:20.583
Unhip.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.791
Well, "When I touch you,
I feel happy inside.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.458
I can't hide. I can't hide."

33:27.208 --> 33:29.791
-"Ask me why, I'll say I love you."
-What you need is a schedule.

33:30.625 --> 33:32.583
Achieve something every day.

33:36.458 --> 33:38.916
-[Yoko] It's so hard, right?
-It's rather hard to live up to, Paul.

33:41.500 --> 33:42.666
[John] I'm planning on 11.

33:43.833 --> 33:45.541
[Paul] It's 12 to 14, Mal.

33:47.916 --> 33:49.166
[John] It's a choice of six.

33:49.750 --> 33:52.166
Some ready to wear
and some made to measure.

33:52.250 --> 33:53.333
[clears throat]

34:00.083 --> 34:02.041
[Michael] We were talking earlier.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.500
About the space between us?

34:04.416 --> 34:05.750
[Michael] About the gap between us.

34:05.833 --> 34:09.291
But about also the documentary, which
is grinding to a halt. How do we do it?

34:09.375 --> 34:11.458
Grinding to a halt?
I think it's taking off.

34:11.541 --> 34:12.833
Exactly. Here we go.

34:12.916 --> 34:16.250
"Loop de loop,"
as Frankie Vaughan once said.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.333
The one-legged wonder.

34:17.416 --> 34:19.500
[all chuckling]

34:19.583 --> 34:22.875
Ringo said that he thought
we ought to just tell it like it is.

34:25.916 --> 34:26.916
I think we are.

34:28.458 --> 34:30.041
[John] Once upon a tarmac,

34:30.125 --> 34:34.000
there lived a small baggage who suffered
incredible distortion on his right leg.

34:35.583 --> 34:38.333
He took it to all the doctors,
and they said…

34:40.416 --> 34:41.416
But one day…

34:44.708 --> 34:45.750
Happy ever after.

34:45.833 --> 34:46.833
[Yoko chuckles]

34:46.916 --> 34:49.291
-[phone rings]
-Ah!

34:49.375 --> 34:52.041
-[chuckles]
-Sir Joseph.

34:52.125 --> 34:53.250
[laughs]

34:53.333 --> 34:55.458
It's about this deal with FBI.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.958
I need another million…

34:59.625 --> 35:03.250
and the written acclamation of Dick James.

35:04.541 --> 35:06.291
I know it's hard. I know it's hard.

35:06.375 --> 35:08.083
They died that we might wank.

35:08.583 --> 35:11.791
[all laughing]

35:14.291 --> 35:16.500
I'm talking about the Boy Scouts
who aren't allowed to masturbate.

35:16.583 --> 35:17.666
Oh.

35:17.750 --> 35:20.125
It's very tempting
when you're wearing shorts.

35:20.833 --> 35:24.416
If they only wore long trousers,
maybe they'd stand a chance, you know?

35:25.208 --> 35:28.375
But I can tell you, you don't go blind
but very shortsighted.

35:28.458 --> 35:32.458
[all laughing]

35:32.541 --> 35:35.291

can we have--

[Tony] We've been doing this film
for the last, sort of, two weeks,

42:29.083 --> 42:33.125
and we've noticed you every day
at Twickenham Studios and also here.

42:33.208 --> 42:35.791
You stand outside all day long.
Can you tell us why?

42:53.250 --> 42:56.625
What do you think of John Lennon
and the relationship with Yoko Ono?

43:03.208 --> 43:05.375
-It doesn't worry you at all?
-No.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.916
It's got nothing to do
with anybody else really, has it?

43:08.833 --> 43:10.125
Not really. That's a good answer.

43:21.333 --> 43:24.666
And you've obviously read in the papers
about the possible split of The Beatles.

43:24.750 --> 43:26.416
I mean, how does that sort of affect you?

43:34.916 --> 43:37.166
As long as I can see him it's all right.

What would you like
to see The Beatles do now?

-A show.

43:46.208 --> 43:48.625

In retrospect, I'm glad we got out.

-Too big?

44:17.750 --> 44:19.541
[Ringo] For what we were doing, you know.

44:19.625 --> 44:20.958
And this is nicer.

44:21.625 --> 44:22.958
[both chuckling]

44:24.541 --> 44:26.166
I'm on a special diet as of today.

44:26.250 --> 44:27.791
-What are you on?
-No food.

44:27.875 --> 44:29.791
Oh, poor, why?

44:29.875 --> 44:31.833
I just feel a little heavy.

44:31.916 --> 44:35.416
When you get out the bath and find you're
not admiring yourself in the mirror.

44:35.500 --> 44:36.500
[Ringo] Too much to admire.

44:36.583 --> 44:39.208
You going to do everything in here?
Rather than go to EMI in future?

44:39.291 --> 44:42.833
-Unless you mean big orchestrations.
-[Ringo] Don't know till we hear it.

44:42.916 --> 44:45.458
George was saying good thing
you have to fight certain things at EMI,

44:45.541 --> 44:47.291
so it's much better
when it hits the record.

44:47.375 --> 44:48.375
-Aye.
-Mmm.

44:48.458 --> 44:50.625
It's a much more real sound,
what the customer buys.

44:56.416 --> 44:58.208
Have you said good morning to Fred?

44:58.291 --> 45:01.250
You'll be able to get rid of these things
once we get set up.

45:01.333 --> 45:03.250
-[Ringo] What things?
-The boom mics.

45:03.333 --> 45:06.166
This is for intimate,
unobserved conversation

45:06.250 --> 45:07.625
in the middle of the room, though.

45:07.708 --> 45:08.958
[chuckles] Unobserved conversation?

45:09.041 --> 45:10.708
[all chuckling]

45:12.208 --> 45:14.250
We should get really underway today,
I think.

45:14.333 --> 45:16.750
We really got underway yesterday.
It was a good day yesterday.

45:16.833 --> 45:19.416
Yeah. From your point of view.
I'm talking about from my point of view.

45:19.500 --> 45:21.208
Oh, yeah, you should get on with it.

45:21.291 --> 45:22.833
[Michael]
How late did you work last night?

45:22.916 --> 45:24.500
[Ringo] About twenty past seven.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.333
It's just that.
But it could have gone longer too.

45:27.416 --> 45:28.500
[Ringo] Mmm. You get me a small--

45:28.583 --> 45:29.916
-[George] Morning.
-[all] Morning, George.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.583
-[George] You're looking very--
-[Michael] Pink.

45:31.666 --> 45:34.875
-Yes, very clean and in order.
-[Michael] And even washed and in order.

45:34.958 --> 45:36.375
-I hear yesterday was good?
-Mmm.

45:36.458 --> 45:37.666
-Work-wise.
-Yeah.

45:37.750 --> 45:39.041
[Michael] Good.

45:39.125 --> 45:41.041
-Good vibes, man.
-Yeah.

45:41.125 --> 45:42.791
[Michael] Morning, Glyn. How are you?

45:42.875 --> 45:44.375
-Morning, Glyn.
-Morning, Glyn.

45:44.458 --> 45:46.375
-[Glyn] Morning, George.
-[George Martin] What are we doing?

45:46.458 --> 45:47.833
What are all these people doing?

45:48.375 --> 45:50.166
[George Martin]
They've come to look at you, John.

45:50.250 --> 45:53.125
Now, who can we find
to switch off this ventilation? Mal?

45:53.625 --> 45:55.000
It's so freezing in here.

45:55.083 --> 45:57.958
[Ringo]
I was listening to-- I've told everybody.

45:58.041 --> 46:01.458
You know the <i>Around the Beatles</i> thing?

46:01.541 --> 46:04.375
-[Glyn] Oh, yeah.
-You did the sound. Great sound.

46:04.458 --> 46:08.708
I just heard it over the weekend.
And we were great as well, you know?

46:08.791 --> 46:11.791
-You were, actually. Yes.
-[chattering]

46:11.875 --> 46:15.833
[Ringo] The acetate's great, 'cause we got
all the sort of rockers first half,

46:15.916 --> 46:19.208
and all, you know, "Love Me Dos"
and "Please Please Me" the second half.

46:19.291 --> 46:22.041
The rockers are so great,
all the kids screaming.

46:22.708 --> 46:23.916
But the sound was great.

46:24.416 --> 46:26.416
[Michael]
I love when you play rock and roll.

46:26.500 --> 46:29.166
Oh, George, before I forget it.
Where do you--

46:36.375 --> 46:39.125
[George Martin] Ah, well, any good
music shop. There are a couple near here.

46:40.666 --> 46:41.666
Chappell's will have it, yeah.

46:41.750 --> 46:43.208
[guitar playing]

46:52.958 --> 46:55.166
[Michael] But I think, you see,
we ought to get together.

46:55.250 --> 46:58.041
See if we're gonna have it out of doors,
whether people just turn up.

46:58.125 --> 47:04.041
[George] Uh, are you still trying to do it
with all people, audience, all in one go?

47:04.125 --> 47:07.666
Yes. Shall we say
we'll do it this weekend week?

47:21.125 --> 47:22.791
[George Martin]
The problem with Glyn, I'd like him--

47:22.875 --> 47:25.208
You know, if he's starting the thing,
I'd like him to finish it.

47:25.291 --> 47:26.958
It's silly, really,
to change horses midstream.

47:27.041 --> 47:27.958
[John] I know.

47:29.666 --> 47:31.666
[Tony]
"Drugs, divorce and a slipping image."

47:31.750 --> 47:37.500
And it says, "But it wasn't the first time
they've traded a few punches."

47:37.583 --> 47:38.625
[John] Yeah.

47:39.583 --> 47:42.500
[all chuckling]

47:42.583 --> 47:44.916
[John] There's only one guy
I'd like to get, and that's Housego.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.375
[Glyn] It's really extraordinary,
the last week's press, isn't it?

47:47.458 --> 47:51.041
[George] Because there's nothing to it
except that it's a lie.

47:51.125 --> 47:53.375
[John] Hope it doesn't come out
about me beating up Maharishi.

47:53.458 --> 47:56.458
No doubt Derek will have read it
before it got in there

47:56.541 --> 47:58.625
and has sent them their telegrams
and things.

47:58.708 --> 48:00.000
[John] Congratulating them.

48:01.958 --> 48:03.250
[John] Morning, Denis.

48:06.166 --> 48:08.625
-Don't you think it's suable?
-No.

48:08.708 --> 48:11.541
-What about the fisticuffs?
-[George] Yeah, none of that.

48:11.625 --> 48:13.166
He said it didn't take place, right?

48:13.250 --> 48:14.666
-He said it did.
-No.

48:14.750 --> 48:16.500
-[John] Oh, crumbs.
-[George] Yes, he did.

48:17.125 --> 48:18.458
[Ringo] He said "might have."

48:18.541 --> 48:21.250
[John] Yes. In the past,
well, that's false too.

48:21.833 --> 48:25.791
It's never got to that, except for a plate
of dinner in Hamburg.

48:25.875 --> 48:28.125
The picture's great, yeah.

48:28.208 --> 48:30.708
George Harrison, the sane one, speaks out.

48:30.791 --> 48:33.791
I read it before the riddles.

48:34.375 --> 48:40.833

49:05.875 --> 49:08.333
-Or would you not like to?
-What's that?

49:08.416 --> 49:11.041
[Michael] We've found we haven't shot
anybody announcing The Rolling Stones.

49:11.708 --> 49:13.166
[John] Oh, I see.

49:13.250 --> 49:16.333
-Well, what kind of--
-It would just be, uh…

49:16.416 --> 49:19.541
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, your host
for this evening, The Rolling Stones,"

49:19.625 --> 49:20.625
or words to that effect.

49:20.708 --> 49:22.583
-If it's straight, then I'll do it.
-Yeah, it's straight.

49:22.666 --> 49:28.958
And now, your host this evening,
Rolling Stones.

49:29.041 --> 49:30.541
[Ringo chuckles]

49:30.625 --> 49:32.125
-[Ringo] Did you see Hancock?
-Yeah.

49:32.208 --> 49:33.208
[chuckles]

49:33.291 --> 49:35.000
[crew] I'm playing it right.

49:35.083 --> 49:36.958
[Michael] That's Keith Moon.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
[vocalizing]

49:44.291 --> 49:46.833
See that? With the sound on, I…

49:48.583 --> 49:50.291
[John] Turn me on, man, will you?

49:51.541 --> 49:52.625
[Michael] Can you juggle?

49:53.375 --> 49:54.791
-It's the one thing I really--
-Watch.

49:54.875 --> 49:56.458
[drumroll]

49:56.541 --> 49:59.208
[Michael, chuckling] So uncoordinated.

49:59.291 --> 50:00.666
[John] No, I can't juggle.

50:00.750 --> 50:02.250
[Michael] Can you juggle, RS?

50:02.875 --> 50:05.291
[John]
While he juggled, I knifed up the wall.

50:08.916 --> 50:10.791
[Ringo] Ready for three.

to answer assault charges.

50:45.791 --> 50:48.500
If he does not appear, he will be given
an immediate jail sentence.

50:49.208 --> 50:52.583
Harrison is accused

50:52.666 --> 50:54.625
as he and Beatle Ringo Starr

50:55.666 --> 50:56.750
Hey!

51:10.833 --> 51:13.250
[Glyn] Does the PA come before
or after the limiters?

51:14.416 --> 51:15.666
After, isn't it?

51:17.458 --> 51:22.333
[Glyn] Can you move the speakers
behind Paul a little bit further round?

51:22.416 --> 51:24.625
[Paul] Glyn?

51:24.708 --> 51:26.791
When will you be set up to tape something?

51:26.875 --> 51:28.208
[George] Haven't they got it plugged up?

51:28.291 --> 51:30.000
[John] Are we not in that situation yet?

51:31.958 --> 51:33.500
[chuckles] No answer.

51:33.583 --> 51:36.125
It's all right. Not yet, you mean?

51:46.291 --> 51:47.541
[Mal] It's been made up by Alex.

51:52.208 --> 51:53.500
How do you tune it?

51:56.708 --> 51:57.541
What?

51:58.750 --> 51:59.750
[John] It looks like he's--

51:59.833 --> 52:01.625
[George]
Let's give him half a million quid.

52:01.708 --> 52:03.083
It looks a good idea.

52:03.166 --> 52:04.500
-Yeah!
-Two-sided bass/rhythm…

52:04.583 --> 52:06.583
[John]
And let's give it him just for this!

52:07.166 --> 52:08.458
I'll put it on show.

52:08.541 --> 52:11.541
[all chuckling]

52:12.625 --> 52:15.250
He might have something in that though.

52:15.333 --> 52:16.541
You never--

52:16.625 --> 52:19.041
He'd have to just have less sides.

52:19.125 --> 52:21.083
[George] There it is now.

52:21.166 --> 52:22.666
-Yeah, two sides.
-Two sides and one…

52:22.750 --> 52:25.166
[George] You're gonna get all your strings
rubbing on your hand.

52:25.666 --> 52:27.458
[John] Tell him to build a prototype.

52:27.541 --> 52:28.833
[George] Better be good!

52:31.875 --> 52:34.791
-Glyn, can you look into the PA thing?
-Let's think in terms of--

52:34.875 --> 52:37.500
We still haven't had
a really good PA sound yet.

52:38.125 --> 52:42.500
You know? If we're gonna do it here,
let's try and get one in this room.

52:42.583 --> 52:46.666
'Cause we still haven't had that, where
we're knocked out with what we hear yet.

52:51.833 --> 52:55.583

-No idea.

[George]
If we're just trying to make the album,

55:48.625 --> 55:50.666
I think we should just start it
straightaway.

55:51.291 --> 55:54.166
I think we're just gonna sing them live
to the camera.

55:54.958 --> 55:56.958

1:19:07.750 --> 1:19:10.625
[Michael] So, but just roughly, timewise,
you'd say in about a week?

1:19:10.708 --> 1:19:11.708
[Paul] Yeah.

1:19:11.791 --> 1:19:16.208
[John] Mal, could you buy
some cooling fans? Just loose ones.

1:19:16.291 --> 1:19:18.875
-[Mal] The engineer's coming over.
-[Ringo] We need the blowers.

1:19:25.333 --> 1:19:26.500
[John] Oh, yeah.

1:19:26.583 --> 1:19:29.625
See, we're never gonna be the same
two days running, you know?

1:19:29.708 --> 1:19:31.916
-It's impossible to remember.
-[Glyn] Sure.

1:19:33.291 --> 1:19:35.791
The amp--
The amp, I'm not bothered about at all.

1:19:35.875 --> 1:19:37.791
It's just the bass itself.

[John] Did you see Fleetwood Mac
on <i>Late Night Live</i>?

1:19:41.041 --> 1:19:43.041
-They were so sweet, man.
-Were they?

1:19:43.125 --> 1:19:45.958
[John] And the lead singer's great.
You know, looks great.

1:19:46.041 --> 1:19:48.041
And he just, sort of,
sings very quiet as well.

1:19:48.125 --> 1:19:49.750
He's not a shouter.

1:19:49.833 --> 1:19:53.125
-And they were just like… [hums]
-[George, indistinct]

1:19:55.166 --> 1:19:56.583
[John] Yeah, but better than Canned Heat.

1:19:59.333 --> 1:20:00.541
Yeah, they're really good though.

1:20:00.625 --> 1:20:03.041

-Then start laying on…

1:42:35.458 --> 1:42:37.625
about sweet Loretta Martin,
the first verse…

1:42:37.708 --> 1:42:39.500
-[John] Just have two for now.
-Yeah.

1:42:39.583 --> 1:42:41.958
[George] But, I mean--
I don't mean really how many verses--

1:42:42.041 --> 1:42:44.583
-Okay, I'll sing it through.
-How many times will you do a verse?

1:42:44.666 --> 1:42:48.166
I'll sing it through and shout
where I think it should go,

1:42:48.250 --> 1:42:51.416
and then if you don't agree,
remember it and we'll change it.

1:42:51.500 --> 1:42:54.500
Well, maybe if we had an intro,
a verse, a chorus,

1:42:54.583 --> 1:42:56.666
of "Get Back,"
and then there's a bit with--

1:42:56.750 --> 1:42:59.750
[Paul] Solo. Yes, solo. Get back, Jo.

1:43:00.708 --> 1:43:03.291
Then there's a bit of chorus
on the end of that solo though.

1:43:03.375 --> 1:43:06.708
Yeah. And then the doo-dah-dum.
Then the next verse,

1:43:07.250 --> 1:43:11.083
the next chorus,
the next solo, the next chorus.

1:43:11.166 --> 1:43:13.416
Well, let's have one guitar solo
and one piano solo then.

1:43:13.500 --> 1:43:14.333
[Paul] Okay.

1:43:14.416 --> 1:43:16.416
'Cause I'm only gonna be
able to work one out.

1:43:17.625 --> 1:43:19.958
[Paul] Who do you wanna be,
Jo Jo or Loretta?

1:43:20.791 --> 1:43:22.375
Get back to sweet Loretta.

1:43:23.125 --> 1:43:24.625

[John] So you do the beginning,
then my solo, then you and me singing,

1:44:45.291 --> 1:44:48.208
and then he comes in,
does his break and a solo,

1:44:48.291 --> 1:44:51.750
then you sing a verse,
and one last, long "Get back" and out.

1:44:51.833 --> 1:44:54.208
-A match, Ring…
-[Paul] Okay. So…

1:44:54.291 --> 1:44:55.375
But that break…

1:44:55.458 --> 1:44:58.500
[John] It's almost natural, like,
rock and roll, except for the break.

1:44:58.583 --> 1:44:59.708
It's just a break before--

1:44:59.791 --> 1:45:02.333
[Paul] See, that's it.
If we make too much of a break,

1:45:02.416 --> 1:45:04.416
we start getting it into, like,
an arranged song.

1:45:04.500 --> 1:45:05.583
[John] Yeah, it just should go…

1:45:05.666 --> 1:45:07.958
[Paul] It's better just to have,
like, a rock and roll song.

1:45:08.041 --> 1:45:10.666
[John] But, I mean,
they did have breaks in the old days.

1:45:10.750 --> 1:45:11.916
[Paul] That's what I mean, yeah.

1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:13.166
[John] Okay. Well, for now I'll vamp.

1:45:13.250 --> 1:45:15.041

The arrangement is only enough to know.

2:26:17.500 --> 2:26:22.041
Glyn, how can we make the piano like one
of those very bad old honky-tonks?

-[George] Tinny the sound.

2:26:30.666 --> 2:26:32.916
-Yeah, just tinnier.
-[George] More like, yeah, honky-tonk.

2:26:34.708 --> 2:26:36.416

-[George Martin] Less like a Blüthner.

2:26:36.500 --> 2:26:38.125
[Michael] Less like a Blüthner, in short.

2:26:38.208 --> 2:26:39.541

2:26:40.708 --> 2:26:43.208
[George] The main thing with this,
in my head it's like,

2:26:43.291 --> 2:26:45.375

2:26:45.458 --> 2:26:48.166
you know,
where nothing was professional at all.

that's why I said yes to the TV show.

2:31:10.625 --> 2:31:12.250
I didn't want the hell of doing it,

2:31:13.625 --> 2:31:17.208
but nobody else wants to go on the stage
or do a TV show.

2:31:17.833 --> 2:31:22.625
You know, that's what it's about.
Nobody wants to get out there. You know?

2:31:22.708 --> 2:31:24.541
I suppose that's true, you know?

2:31:24.625 --> 2:31:28.583
I think so, you know?
I'm only going by what's happened.

2:31:28.666 --> 2:31:30.333
Yeah, yeah.

2:31:31.166 --> 2:31:33.541

-I can't answer it, you know?

2:31:36.625 --> 2:31:39.625
I know that
there's no sort of answer for it, but…

2:31:40.333 --> 2:31:43.375
The things that have worked out
best ever for us

2:31:43.458 --> 2:31:46.041
haven't really been planned
any more than this has.

2:31:46.125 --> 2:31:51.333
It's just, you know, it's like you just go
into something and it does it itself.

2:31:51.416 --> 2:31:54.916
You know, whatever it's gonna be,
it becomes that, you know?

2:31:55.000 --> 2:31:57.833
[John] See, it's turned out
it's not what Paul wants.

2:31:57.916 --> 2:32:01.125
It's like if it's--
Say it's his number, this whole show.

2:32:01.208 --> 2:32:04.583
It's actually turned into our number
more than his number.

2:32:04.666 --> 2:32:06.666
That's all. And, uh…

2:32:08.458 --> 2:32:10.166
It's just that, really.

2:32:10.250 --> 2:32:13.041
Yeah, I know,
it is majority decisions and all. Yeah.

2:32:13.666 --> 2:32:17.375
We're presuming that we are gonna make
this LP anyway as one whole piece,

2:32:17.458 --> 2:32:19.333
like as if the cameras aren't here.

2:32:20.916 --> 2:32:23.500
But it might be an idea
to sort of face 'em…

2:32:23.583 --> 2:32:24.583
[Paul] Mmm.

2:32:24.666 --> 2:32:26.041
[John] …for the singing.

2:32:26.125 --> 2:32:31.125
The point of doing it all in one go
is that we're aware of the camera.

2:32:31.208 --> 2:32:33.208
So we should look at the camera.

2:32:33.291 --> 2:32:35.666
And we sing it straight to 'em. You know?

2:32:35.750 --> 2:32:36.750
-Yeah.
-[John] And--

2:32:36.833 --> 2:32:39.375
The finale'd just be us
doing the numbers well.

2:32:45.208 --> 2:32:46.291
What do you think?

2:32:46.875 --> 2:32:48.875
The main thing is to do the change

2:32:48.958 --> 2:32:51.250
from the acoustic numbers
to the electric numbers.

2:32:51.875 --> 2:32:54.125
I mean, if we're doing a stage show,
we'd have to--

2:32:54.208 --> 2:32:58.208
"Hold on a sec, ladies and gentlemen,
George just getting on his Rickenbacker."

2:32:58.291 --> 2:33:01.250
As far as I'm concerned, I would need
one run-through on each number

2:33:01.333 --> 2:33:04.708
to get the balance set for it,
'cause it's all-- everything's changing.

2:33:04.791 --> 2:33:08.291
We'll know that better
as soon as we've got an order.

2:33:12.083 --> 2:33:13.708
Soon as we've got a story.

2:33:13.791 --> 2:33:16.208
It's all right, but I'd meant to sort of

2:33:16.291 --> 2:33:18.291
put the songs
to some other framework this time.

2:33:18.375 --> 2:33:19.875
That's what I'd sort of thought.

2:33:20.750 --> 2:33:25.583
That we'd just keep to the same
environment, totally-- always, you know?

2:33:25.666 --> 2:33:27.791
We don't ever attempt to break out of it.

2:33:27.875 --> 2:33:32.208
We-- We're in a recording studio again
in London making another album, you know?

2:33:32.291 --> 2:33:36.083
I think this is the nicest place
I've been for a long time, this studio.

2:33:36.166 --> 2:33:38.416
-Yeah, it is.
-[George] No, really, you know, I mean.

2:33:38.500 --> 2:33:40.125
And also we've played--

2:33:40.208 --> 2:33:43.708
This is the most I've ever played
by playing every day.

2:33:43.791 --> 2:33:48.625
And I can just feel meself getting--
me fingers getting loose a bit.

2:33:48.708 --> 2:33:49.916
Yeah.

2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:52.166
Because we don't get the chance
to do that.

2:33:52.250 --> 2:33:54.583
-But really I just want to play.
-[John] That's what it was about.

2:33:54.666 --> 2:33:59.916
What we've got
is you all playing live in one room.

2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:02.750
That in itself is a fresh thing
for The Beatles.

2:34:02.833 --> 2:34:03.833
Mmm.

2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:06.916
Are you gonna just stay around
in a circle?

2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:09.208
Unless we felt like standing up
'cause it was a shouter, you know?

2:34:09.291 --> 2:34:10.500
[Michael] No matter what we do,

2:34:10.583 --> 2:34:13.291
it's still gonna look like
you're sitting in a room making the album.

2:34:13.375 --> 2:34:15.041
-It's not per se a show.
-[George playing guitar]

2:34:15.125 --> 2:34:19.875
All we've got is us, and the documentary,
where we happen to be singing.

2:34:21.416 --> 2:34:23.958
I mean, you see what happens
when we're just grooving to the music.

2:34:24.041 --> 2:34:26.750
-The whole place changes.
-[Paul] Yeah, that's true.

2:34:26.833 --> 2:34:29.666
And that--
If we're doing them well on the day,

2:34:29.750 --> 2:34:30.916
without anything…

2:34:32.166 --> 2:34:34.458
it should come over.
We've gotta do it, you know?

2:34:36.250 --> 2:34:39.375
[Michael] And also, remember,
the original idea was a TV show

2:34:39.458 --> 2:34:41.000
and then a documentary about it.

2:34:41.083 --> 2:34:43.083
And now it's changed to being a movie.

2:34:43.166 --> 2:34:46.916
It's like, really,
if we're gonna do a film for cinema,

2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:49.083
it should've been done on 35 millimeters,

2:34:49.166 --> 2:34:51.166
which is just the best quality.

2:34:51.875 --> 2:34:54.666
We shot this on 16
because it's a television thing.

2:34:54.750 --> 2:34:57.708
Just the still photos
would make a UA movie

2:34:57.791 --> 2:34:59.708
with soundtrack on it, you know?

2:35:00.291 --> 2:35:04.541
I think we should blow it up to 35
and if they don't take it,

2:35:04.625 --> 2:35:06.125
-they're fucking fools.
-[Paul] Yeah.

2:35:06.208 --> 2:35:08.416
[laughing] Because they're not gonna get
anything else, are they?

2:35:08.500 --> 2:35:10.750
Unless we've got
incredible quality on this,

2:35:10.833 --> 2:35:13.208
16 blown to 35 is a mess.

2:35:13.291 --> 2:35:14.708
-[George] No, it's not.
-Generally.

2:35:14.791 --> 2:35:17.458
There's a certain stock
that blows up better.

2:35:17.541 --> 2:35:18.958
Ektachrome 500.

2:35:19.041 --> 2:35:20.916
Yeah, this will blow up all right,
this film.

2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:22.458
Yeah?

2:35:22.541 --> 2:35:25.541
I don't know what it is that
I'm moaning about, but it's just sort of--

2:35:25.625 --> 2:35:28.333
I must admit I can't really see it either,
because it's--

2:35:28.416 --> 2:35:30.958
It just seems the last two days
everything's gone so ridiculously well.

2:35:31.041 --> 2:35:33.375
-He's right, you know.
-It is good. It's going great.

2:35:33.458 --> 2:35:34.791
It really is something.

2:35:34.875 --> 2:35:36.041
-[Yoko] It's true though.
-Mmm.

2:35:36.958 --> 2:35:40.250
I just have a feeling that we--
It's all right, you know?

2:35:40.333 --> 2:35:42.208
It's nothing to complain about, but…

2:35:43.083 --> 2:35:46.333
But it's just funny to sort of
realize that after this is all over,

2:35:46.416 --> 2:35:50.291
you'll be off in a black bag somewhere
on the Albert Hall, you know?

2:35:50.375 --> 2:35:51.833
Yeah.

2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:56.041
What you're moaning about
is there's no payoff.

2:35:56.791 --> 2:35:59.083
I think all I wanna do is, like, uh…

2:35:59.708 --> 2:36:02.916
I probably, you know,
having got it together,

2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:05.125
I probably just wanna go
and have fun with it.

2:36:05.208 --> 2:36:09.291
Rather than just, sort of,
finish off exactly as we started.

2:36:09.375 --> 2:36:12.250
And I'd like to sort of do a…
[exclaims] …for the finish.

2:36:12.333 --> 2:36:14.375
-Mmm.
-And we just get out in the open,

2:36:14.458 --> 2:36:15.583
change of scene,

2:36:15.666 --> 2:36:20.083
and go and do it somewhere else,
do it on a live show, do it on a stage.

2:36:20.166 --> 2:36:21.833
You know, I'd like to light a rocket

2:36:21.916 --> 2:36:24.375
and really sort of
take off for the end of it.

2:36:24.458 --> 2:36:26.666
And, uh, you know…

2:36:26.750 --> 2:36:29.541
but that's going a bit, like, overboard,
I suppose.

2:36:29.625 --> 2:36:31.125
[Michael] Still could do that.

2:36:31.625 --> 2:36:33.500
