Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"The Underground Adventure"</font>

01:05.081 --> 01:07.120
- Lion Guard!
- Lion Guard!

01:07.207 --> 01:08.909
- Help!
- Help!

01:08.996 --> 01:10.542
That's Tiifu and Zuri.

01:10.629 --> 01:12.136
Sounds like
they're in trouble.

01:12.223 --> 01:13.643
Ono? See anything?

01:13.730 --> 01:16.659
Negative. The calls are coming
from inside Pride Rock.

01:16.746 --> 01:18.511
Let's check it out.
Come on.

01:21.112 --> 01:23.418
Tiifu, Zuri. What's wrong?

01:23.505 --> 01:25.386
What's wrong?
Look at us.

01:25.473 --> 01:27.003
Our fur won't lay straight.

01:27.090 --> 01:29.253
It's too hot
and dry around here.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.761
Well, it is the dry season.

01:31.848 --> 01:34.112
But it's not just our fur.

01:34.199 --> 01:37.300
Our paws are cracked,
our noses are scaly.

01:37.387 --> 01:38.895
We look horrible.

01:38.982 --> 01:39.964
Seriously?

01:40.063 --> 01:41.604
Oh, no.

01:41.691 --> 01:45.055
I told you two not to call
the Lion Guard for this.

01:45.142 --> 01:46.803
- But, Kiara...
- Ladies.

01:46.904 --> 01:49.985
The Guard is only
for real emergencies.

01:50.072 --> 01:51.586
Not fur emergencies.

01:51.673 --> 01:52.701
Understand?

01:52.788 --> 01:55.336
- Sorry.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

01:55.423 --> 01:58.425
Maybe you should try the warm mud
pots at the edge of the Pride Lands.

01:58.512 --> 02:00.628
Us hippos love 'em
when the weather's too dry.

02:00.715 --> 02:02.697
Mud can be very moisturizing.

02:02.784 --> 02:03.813
That's perfect.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.535
We'll go to the mud pots.

02:05.622 --> 02:07.302
You have to come, too, Kiara.

02:07.389 --> 02:08.945
We never see you anymore.

02:09.032 --> 02:10.658
Yeah. You're always so busy

02:10.746 --> 02:12.507
with boring
Royal Family stuff.

02:12.594 --> 02:14.611
"Boring Royal Family stuff"?

02:14.698 --> 02:17.954
Like helping the Pride Landers
deal with the threat of Scar?

02:18.041 --> 02:20.690
Exactly. And it'd be
good for you, Kiara.

02:20.777 --> 02:24.326
I didn't want to say it, but you're
looking a little frizzy yourself.

02:25.652 --> 02:26.776
Mom?

02:26.894 --> 02:30.023
The edge of the Pride Lands
isn't as safe as it used to be.

02:30.110 --> 02:32.448
But if you had an escort
from the Lion Guard...

02:32.535 --> 02:34.823
I'd be happy to take Kiara
to the mud pots.

02:34.910 --> 02:36.830
No one'll keep her
safer than me.

02:36.917 --> 02:39.702
I was thinking
more about Kion.

02:39.789 --> 02:42.511
Kion can come too.
That'll make it more fun.

02:42.598 --> 02:45.030
We wouldn't be going
to have fun, Bunga.

02:45.117 --> 02:48.381
But you'd definitely be safer
with two Lion Guard members.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.476
- I'll go.
- Thanks, Kion.

02:50.563 --> 02:52.028
Girls' Day Away.
Girls' Day Away.

02:52.115 --> 02:53.640
Girls' Day Away.
Girls' Day Away.

02:53.727 --> 02:55.242
Fuli, Beshte, Ono,

02:55.329 --> 02:57.086
keep up the daily patrol.

02:57.173 --> 03:00.326
Looks like Bunga and I are
going on a Girls' Day Away.

03:00.413 --> 03:02.370
Huh! Better you than me.

03:06.461 --> 03:08.597
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

03:09.087 --> 03:10.898
Ew! Don't get us muddy.

03:10.985 --> 03:13.096
Why not? I thought you
wanted to get muddy.

03:13.183 --> 03:14.250
Not like that.

03:14.337 --> 03:16.430
We came to relax in the mud,

03:16.517 --> 03:17.798
not splash around.

03:17.885 --> 03:19.440
But splashing's more fun.

03:19.527 --> 03:20.694
Look.

03:22.155 --> 03:23.603
Bunga, come on.

03:23.690 --> 03:25.038
We're not here to have fun.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.406
We're here to keep watch.

03:26.493 --> 03:28.823
Okay, I'll keep watch.

03:29.863 --> 03:31.109
Is that Scar?

03:31.196 --> 03:32.364
Where?

03:33.274 --> 03:34.367
Gotcha.

03:34.454 --> 03:36.659
Oh, ho, hoh!
It's on.

03:38.787 --> 03:40.818
Why do boys like to be
so messy?

03:40.905 --> 03:42.107
Messy can be fun.

03:42.194 --> 03:43.562
Mmm, I don't think so.

03:43.649 --> 03:46.633
Relaxing and
pampering ourselves is fun.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.878
Come on, Kiara.
You'll see.

03:55.019 --> 03:56.219
Yeah.

04:03.930 --> 04:04.995
Whoa!

04:20.442 --> 04:22.110
Hey. Hey.

04:22.227 --> 04:23.406
Hey!

04:24.719 --> 04:26.929
Keep it down out here.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.214
Some of us
are trying to sleep.

04:29.301 --> 04:30.470
Sorry, Muhangus.

04:30.557 --> 04:32.100
We didn't know you were here.

04:32.187 --> 04:33.270
'Course not.

04:33.357 --> 04:37.573
'Cause why would an aardvark be
anywhere near an aardvark hole?

04:39.288 --> 04:40.720
Gotcha.

04:41.032 --> 04:42.659
Gotcha back.

04:43.694 --> 04:45.851
I think I'll stick
with you two.

04:45.938 --> 04:47.053
Quieter fun.

04:56.175 --> 04:59.132
Kion and his sister?

04:59.219 --> 05:01.373
At the edge
of the Pride Lands.

05:01.460 --> 05:05.065
And they're surrounded
by dry plants and grass.

05:05.875 --> 05:10.616
One spark is all it would take to
send the whole place up in flames.

05:10.703 --> 05:13.007
And half the
Royal Family with it.

05:14.134 --> 05:16.984
Then why stop
at a single spark?

05:17.071 --> 05:18.133
Njano,

05:18.338 --> 05:20.671
fetch me a vulture.

05:20.758 --> 05:22.470
You got it, Scar.

05:22.557 --> 05:23.735
A vulture?

05:23.862 --> 05:25.258
Yes.

05:25.375 --> 05:30.116
We're going to deliver Kion and
his companions a little gift...

05:30.203 --> 05:31.242
Of...

05:31.403 --> 05:32.732
Fire.

05:32.819 --> 05:34.100
Mmm...

05:34.187 --> 05:36.501
This feels great.

05:36.588 --> 05:38.370
So relaxing.

05:38.457 --> 05:40.205
It is nice.

05:40.292 --> 05:43.635
Yeah. It really is.

05:44.192 --> 05:45.890
Sure you don't
wanna try this, Kion?

05:45.977 --> 05:47.901
It's un-Bunga-lievable.

05:49.554 --> 05:50.937
Do you hear that?

05:51.024 --> 05:53.080
Nope. I don't hear anything.

05:53.206 --> 05:54.874
I think we should go.

05:54.961 --> 05:57.705
But we can't leave until
the mud masks dry properly.

05:57.792 --> 05:58.839
Spa rule.

05:58.953 --> 06:00.448
Spa rule, Kion.

06:00.535 --> 06:02.362
Nothin' we can do.

06:04.317 --> 06:06.264
Something's not right, Bunga.

06:06.351 --> 06:08.521
Ah, you worry too much.

06:11.476 --> 06:12.580
Fire!

06:13.385 --> 06:14.615
We have to get out of here.

06:14.683 --> 06:15.750
Come on.

06:20.648 --> 06:23.216
Move away! Get back.
Hurry!

06:23.303 --> 06:25.878
What do we do?
We're surrounded.

06:25.978 --> 06:27.442
Bunga. Fire break.

06:27.529 --> 06:28.547
Got it.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.718
Kiara, Tiifu, Zuri.

06:30.805 --> 06:32.130
Take cover in the mud.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.866
No way. I'm helping you
with the fire break.

06:34.953 --> 06:37.064
Okay. But Tiifu and Zuri,

06:37.151 --> 06:38.263
the mud pots.

06:38.350 --> 06:39.695
Let's go.

06:43.258 --> 06:46.092
Huh. My fur smells like smoke.

06:46.219 --> 06:49.088
Tiifu? That's not your fur.

06:51.598 --> 06:53.659
- Kiara!
- Kiara!

06:55.821 --> 06:57.934
Kion. Bunga.
We're too late.

06:58.021 --> 07:00.838
Embers have already
jumped the fire break.

07:02.352 --> 07:03.717
Muhangus' burrow.

07:03.804 --> 07:06.948
Quick. Everyone into
the aardvark hole.

07:11.006 --> 07:12.636
But it's dark down there.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.125
And dirty.

07:14.212 --> 07:16.307
You were just sitting in mud.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.843
Oh, yeah.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.491
Do I have to?

07:19.578 --> 07:22.051
Tiifu! Kiara! Move! Now!

07:22.138 --> 07:23.946
Tiifu, I'll be
right behind you.

07:24.033 --> 07:25.226
Okay.

07:29.603 --> 07:30.949
Everyone okay?

07:31.036 --> 07:32.083
Yep.
Yeah.

07:32.170 --> 07:33.549
I guess so.

07:33.636 --> 07:35.563
Tiifu? Are you okay?

07:35.650 --> 07:36.623
Mmm-hmm.

07:36.710 --> 07:37.791
We got lucky.

07:37.878 --> 07:40.561
We can stay right here
and wait out the fire.

07:40.648 --> 07:42.344
How long will that take?

07:42.431 --> 07:44.659
I don't know. All day, maybe.

07:44.727 --> 07:45.771
All day?

07:45.839 --> 07:48.099
Don't worry, Tiifu.
It'll be fun.

07:48.186 --> 07:49.335
- Fun?
- Yeah.

07:49.422 --> 07:51.901
All of us in this
dark little space.

07:51.988 --> 07:54.229
Deep, deep underground.

07:54.784 --> 07:55.807
Bunga...

07:55.894 --> 07:58.343
We might even get to spend
the whole night down here.

07:58.430 --> 08:00.747
No! I can't be here all night.

08:00.834 --> 08:03.428
Tiifu, stop!
You can't go back up there.

08:03.515 --> 08:04.942
The fire's still burning.

08:05.029 --> 08:06.966
But I have to get out.
Now!

08:07.127 --> 08:08.813
- Whoa!
- Tiifu.

08:08.900 --> 08:09.996
Kiara!

08:10.083 --> 08:11.418
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:11.505 --> 08:12.943
Look out!

08:17.977 --> 08:19.802
Kiara? Tiifu?

08:24.444 --> 08:25.825
Are you okay?

08:25.913 --> 08:27.173
We're fine.

08:27.260 --> 08:29.052
Tiifu, what happened?

08:29.139 --> 08:31.351
Kion said we were safe.
Why did you run?

08:31.438 --> 08:33.294
I'm sorry. It's just...

08:33.381 --> 08:35.248
I'm afraid of the dark.

08:35.335 --> 08:37.682
Well, now with all
the extra dirt in here,

08:37.769 --> 08:39.097
it's even darker.

08:39.183 --> 08:40.236
Zuri.

08:40.323 --> 08:43.063
I'm sorry, Tiifu.
I had no idea.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.472
You don't seem scared
of the dark at home.

08:45.559 --> 08:46.625
That's different.

08:46.712 --> 08:48.894
I can see stars
or the moon there.

08:48.981 --> 08:50.021
But here...

08:50.108 --> 08:51.264
It's so dark.

08:51.351 --> 08:53.112
Anything could be
hiding in the shadows.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.206
Anything.

08:54.293 --> 08:56.810
Oh, yeah.
Like a big, scary beast

08:56.897 --> 08:58.576
with big pointy claws

08:58.663 --> 09:00.394
and razor-sharp teeth.

09:00.481 --> 09:01.631
Yes!

09:01.737 --> 09:02.983
Bunga.

09:04.497 --> 09:06.443
It's okay to be afraid, Tiifu.

09:06.530 --> 09:07.647
We understand.

09:07.734 --> 09:10.112
Yeah. But maybe
you could have just told us

09:10.199 --> 09:12.152
instead of blocking
our only way out.

09:12.628 --> 09:14.166
So we're
stuck down here?

09:14.262 --> 09:16.715
Don't worry.
We'll find another way out.

09:16.802 --> 09:19.925
We just need to figure out which
one of these tunnels to try.

09:20.012 --> 09:21.628
The one with the least dirt.

09:21.715 --> 09:23.136
The one with the most light.

09:23.223 --> 09:24.190
Tiifu,

09:24.277 --> 09:27.206
it's probably gonna get darker
before it gets lighter.

09:27.293 --> 09:29.035
It... It is?

09:29.122 --> 09:31.122
But we'll be
right there with you.

09:31.209 --> 09:33.566
And we won't let
anything happen to you.

09:33.653 --> 09:34.671
Okay?

09:34.780 --> 09:35.811
Oh...

09:35.898 --> 09:37.256
Okay.

09:38.814 --> 09:40.042
Let's try this one.

09:45.913 --> 09:48.154
Tiifu, I know you're scared.

09:48.241 --> 09:49.656
But you're too close.

09:49.743 --> 09:51.744
You're frizzing my fur again.

09:51.831 --> 09:52.833
Sorry.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.073
I just feel better
knowing you're right there.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.102
We are.

09:56.189 --> 09:57.876
And we'll stay right here.

09:58.256 --> 09:59.316
'Course we will.

09:59.403 --> 10:02.133
It's not like that big scary
beast'll jump out of the dark

10:02.220 --> 10:03.735
and drag us all away.

10:03.822 --> 10:04.804
Bunga!

10:08.875 --> 10:10.002
What was that?

10:10.089 --> 10:11.146
I don't know.

10:11.233 --> 10:12.944
But it sounds like
it came from that hole.

10:14.974 --> 10:15.980
The

10:16.067 --> 10:18.092
big, scary...

10:18.179 --> 10:19.389
Beast!

10:25.416 --> 10:27.193
Get out of my home.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.842
Come on, stop.

10:29.051 --> 10:30.147
That tickles.

10:30.218 --> 10:31.311
I'm gonna...

10:31.379 --> 10:32.401
I'm gonna...

10:33.593 --> 10:35.282
No!
Gotcha.

10:35.530 --> 10:36.596
Oh, yeah?

10:36.708 --> 10:37.827
Says you.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.474
You're not very friendly,
are you?

10:41.561 --> 10:43.243
Not to trespassers I'm not.

10:43.330 --> 10:45.910
Let me go and I'll show you
what "not friendly" feels like.

10:45.997 --> 10:48.333
Uh! It's adorable.

10:48.420 --> 10:49.701
I think he's mean.

10:49.788 --> 10:52.743
Scaring us when
all we want to do is go home.

10:53.273 --> 10:55.759
Wait. You mean
you're not after my tunnels?

10:55.846 --> 10:57.130
- No.
- Oh.

10:57.217 --> 10:58.857
I guess I jumped too soon.

10:58.944 --> 11:01.646
Um, could you put me down now?

11:01.733 --> 11:03.983
Okay. Sure, little mole guy.

11:04.471 --> 11:05.984
The name's Kuchimba.

11:06.071 --> 11:07.532
Sorry about before.

11:07.619 --> 11:09.415
We golden moles are...

11:09.856 --> 11:11.388
A little territorial.

11:11.475 --> 11:14.040
But I thought these were
all aardvark tunnels.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.723
Spoken like
a true surface crawler.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.880
All sorts of animals
live down here.

11:18.967 --> 11:21.024
And some of 'em
are tunnel thieves.

11:21.561 --> 11:23.425
But you're not. So...

11:23.512 --> 11:25.573
Why don't I make up
for my unwarranted hostility,

11:25.660 --> 11:26.740
and help you get home?

11:26.808 --> 11:28.448
You can get us back
to Pride Rock?

11:28.535 --> 11:30.470
How can he get us anywhere?

11:30.557 --> 11:32.424
I don't think he has eyes.

11:32.511 --> 11:33.967
I don't.

11:34.714 --> 11:36.571
But I do have ears,

11:36.658 --> 11:37.831
so I heard that.

11:37.918 --> 11:41.519
I can also smell and feel all
the vibrations in the ground.

11:41.606 --> 11:43.468
That's how I find my way
around in the dark.

11:43.555 --> 11:45.128
Are you always in the dark?

11:45.215 --> 11:46.261
Sure.

11:46.393 --> 11:47.540
It's my home.

11:47.627 --> 11:49.771
So those vibrations you feel.

11:49.858 --> 11:51.874
Is that how you'll
get us out of here?

11:51.961 --> 11:53.297
That's right.

11:53.772 --> 11:56.878
Just follow me and I'll take you
right where you need to go.

11:56.965 --> 11:59.691
Kuchimba, don't you get scared
being down here?

11:59.778 --> 12:00.794
In the dark.

12:00.881 --> 12:01.933
Why would I?

12:02.020 --> 12:04.261
There's nothing scary
about being in the dark.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.370
Really?

12:05.457 --> 12:07.352
I keep thinking I hear things.

12:07.467 --> 12:08.982
And see things.

12:09.069 --> 12:10.927
That's just your imagination.

12:11.014 --> 12:12.632
Really?
Sure.

12:12.719 --> 12:13.927
Take it from me.

13:41.183 --> 13:43.487
Just head around the corner,
take the main tunnel.

13:43.574 --> 13:45.256
You'll come out
right by Pride Rock.

13:45.343 --> 13:46.448
Thanks, Kuchimba.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.821
See ya next time
we're underground.

13:50.501 --> 13:53.638
Are you sure you can't come the
rest of the way with us, Kuchimba?

13:53.725 --> 13:55.664
I have to stay
and protect my tunnels.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.398
But remember what I said.

13:57.485 --> 13:59.571
Nothin' to fear down here.

13:59.658 --> 14:02.841
Right. You'll do great.
I know it.

14:02.928 --> 14:04.449
So long, Tiifu.

14:04.929 --> 14:06.656
Kuchimba. Wait!

14:06.743 --> 14:07.845
Kuchimba!

14:08.097 --> 14:09.162
Kuchimba!

14:09.618 --> 14:11.684
Kion? What's wrong?

14:11.771 --> 14:13.488
We have a problem.

14:15.351 --> 14:16.509
Oh.

14:16.805 --> 14:18.381
Which one's the main one?

14:18.468 --> 14:19.639
I don't know.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.922
I wish Kuchimba
was still here.

14:22.009 --> 14:23.195
We'll be fine.

14:23.282 --> 14:25.500
Remember? Nothin' to fear
down here.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.333
What's that?

14:27.585 --> 14:28.719
Hoof steps.

14:28.806 --> 14:31.336
Maybe we're getting
close to the surface.

14:32.578 --> 14:34.613
Sounds like they're
coming from that one.

14:34.700 --> 14:37.167
What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.568
What? It's you?

14:42.655 --> 14:43.814
Is it?

14:44.079 --> 14:47.220
Oh, yes. It is me.

14:47.307 --> 14:48.435
How'd you get here?

14:48.522 --> 14:49.755
Good question.

14:49.842 --> 14:50.992
I wish I knew.

14:51.079 --> 14:53.070
Does that tunnel
lead to the surface?

14:53.157 --> 14:54.758
The surface of what?

14:54.845 --> 14:56.761
That's gotta be
the way he came in.

14:56.848 --> 14:59.266
Let's go.<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

14:59.353 --> 15:01.355
Bunga. Wait for us.

15:01.509 --> 15:04.769
Come on. We'll help you get
back to the Pride Lands too.

15:04.856 --> 15:06.525
Oh, goody.

15:06.845 --> 15:09.792
So, where are we now?

15:10.541 --> 15:12.761
Nothin' to fear down here.

15:12.848 --> 15:15.238
Nothin' to fear down here.

15:16.426 --> 15:18.320
If the zebra came in this way,

15:18.407 --> 15:19.784
shouldn't we be out by now?

15:19.871 --> 15:20.953
Relax, Tiifu.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.809
I'm sure it won't be
much longer.

15:22.877 --> 15:23.962
Uh...

15:27.823 --> 15:29.097
Great.

15:29.199 --> 15:30.988
Now where do we go?

15:31.642 --> 15:34.999
Any chance you remember which one
of those tunnels you came down?

15:35.086 --> 15:36.326
Well, of course.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.417
It was that one.

15:40.158 --> 15:41.329
Hmm.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.636
This didn't happen last time.

15:45.790 --> 15:48.214
That zebra has no idea
where he's going.

15:48.301 --> 15:50.513
He doesn't even know
where he's been.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.339
Kion. We gotta
get out of here.

15:53.426 --> 15:54.578
Of course.

15:54.712 --> 15:55.727
Muhangus.

15:55.814 --> 15:57.305
Huh?
What about him?

15:57.392 --> 15:58.977
We came in through his den.

15:59.064 --> 16:01.086
He's got to be
down here somewhere.

16:01.173 --> 16:03.527
If we can find him,
he can lead us out.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.154
Ready for some tracking?

16:05.241 --> 16:06.777
When am I not?

16:11.657 --> 16:13.141
That can't be comfortable.

16:13.228 --> 16:14.872
How about I get you unstuck?

16:14.959 --> 16:16.597
Someone's stuck?

16:16.684 --> 16:18.099
How dreadful.

16:18.186 --> 16:19.545
Not for long.

16:19.632 --> 16:21.867
Kion. I've got it.

16:25.945 --> 16:27.219
I smell it too.

16:27.306 --> 16:29.269
It's faint, but it's there.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.517
Let's go.

16:30.621 --> 16:32.489
Tiifu, Zuri, come on.

16:32.786 --> 16:35.121
We're coming...

16:35.208 --> 16:36.548
Too.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.222
Oh. That feels so much better.

16:40.816 --> 16:41.816
Come on.

16:45.992 --> 16:47.006
We did it.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.706
We found Muhangus.

16:48.793 --> 16:51.744
Um, looks like a wall to me.

16:51.831 --> 16:54.045
And Muhangus is somewhere
on the other side.

16:54.132 --> 16:56.164
We just have to
dig our way to him.

16:56.251 --> 16:59.217
Ah-ha. Sounds like a job
for a honey badger.

16:59.304 --> 17:00.385
Here we go.

17:00.472 --> 17:03.125
No! You and Kion can't go.

17:03.212 --> 17:04.916
Tiifu, they have to go.

17:05.281 --> 17:06.977
That's how
they'll get us home.

17:07.064 --> 17:09.346
But what if something happens
and they don't come back?

17:09.433 --> 17:11.359
We'd be stuck here forever.

17:11.446 --> 17:14.034
Tiifu. I promise
that won't happen.

17:14.121 --> 17:15.136
We'll be back.

17:15.223 --> 17:16.381
And in the meantime,

17:16.468 --> 17:19.347
you'll have your best friends
right by your side.

17:19.434 --> 17:20.931
Oh, yes.

17:21.449 --> 17:24.105
We'll be right by your side.

17:33.513 --> 17:36.148
Ah-ha! One aardvark,
straight ahead.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.378
Nice place.

17:39.879 --> 17:41.270
Muhangus?

17:41.381 --> 17:42.747
Muhangus?

17:43.049 --> 17:44.726
Nah, I got this.

17:44.851 --> 17:47.086
Wake up!

17:47.731 --> 17:49.230
You again?

17:49.317 --> 17:50.936
What is it with you two?

17:51.023 --> 17:54.343
You got something against
aardvarks getting some sleep?

17:54.430 --> 17:56.769
No. Not at all. We're sorry.

17:56.856 --> 17:59.744
It's just, we got lost
down here with our friends.

17:59.831 --> 18:01.590
We were hoping you could help.

18:02.403 --> 18:05.116
Maybe after
I'm done sleeping.

18:05.670 --> 18:08.679
Okay. If that's the way
you want it.

18:08.883 --> 18:10.455
Scoot over.

18:11.692 --> 18:13.668
Hey. What are you doing?

18:13.755 --> 18:16.461
If you can't get us out,
we'll just move in here.

18:16.548 --> 18:18.184
We'll be den-mates.

18:20.382 --> 18:22.268
Hey, get out of here.

18:22.355 --> 18:24.652
Shh. After I'm done sleeping.

18:27.808 --> 18:29.375
All right. All right.

18:29.462 --> 18:32.464
If it means gettin'
rid of you, I'll help you.

18:32.898 --> 18:34.994
Shouldn't Kion and Bunga
be back by now?

18:35.081 --> 18:37.345
I don't know.
Should we?

18:37.475 --> 18:38.691
You found him.

18:38.778 --> 18:41.603
Yep. And he's gonna
help us get out of here.

18:41.734 --> 18:44.997
Only because the honey badger
annoyed me into it.

18:45.084 --> 18:48.018
I can be really annoying
when I put my mind to it.

18:48.105 --> 18:50.103
Oh, you got that right.

18:51.273 --> 18:53.353
Does Muhangus even know
where he's going?

18:53.440 --> 18:55.004
We've been walking forever.

18:55.091 --> 18:57.411
I know. I just want
to be home.

18:57.498 --> 18:59.816
Then I think you'll like
what's up ahead.

18:59.903 --> 19:01.082
Look.

19:01.957 --> 19:03.264
I see daylight.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.400
We made it.

19:04.468 --> 19:05.965
Sorry. Gotta run.

19:06.052 --> 19:07.030
Hey!

19:07.133 --> 19:08.382
How rude.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.281
Where is she running to?

19:10.368 --> 19:13.240
We were all having
such a lovely time.

19:13.327 --> 19:15.326
Nah, she's just afraid
of the dark.

19:15.413 --> 19:17.611
She didn't like
being trapped down here.

19:18.128 --> 19:21.111
Trapped? All this time
we've been trapped?

19:21.198 --> 19:22.428
In the dark?

19:22.515 --> 19:24.170
Uh-oh.
It's okay.

19:24.257 --> 19:25.973
- You don't have to...
- Panic and run.

19:26.060 --> 19:27.584
Panic and run!

19:27.671 --> 19:28.901
Stop it. Stop it!

19:28.988 --> 19:30.519
The tunnel will collapse!

19:30.606 --> 19:32.970
Panic and run.
Every animal for himself!

19:35.261 --> 19:37.543
Panic and run! Panic and run!

19:37.630 --> 19:39.024
You don't have to panic.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.089
I do!

19:40.176 --> 19:42.899
We're trapped and it's dark!

19:42.986 --> 19:44.896
Panic and run. Panic and run.

19:44.983 --> 19:46.712
Wait. Stop.
Panic and run!

19:46.799 --> 19:47.855
Tiifu?

19:47.942 --> 19:49.886
Get out of his way.
You'll get hurt.

19:49.973 --> 19:51.405
It's okay. I can help.

19:51.492 --> 19:53.374
I know what he needs to hear.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.001
It's okay to be scared.

19:57.088 --> 19:58.723
It's scary in the dark.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.498
Ye-Yes.

20:00.585 --> 20:03.270
It is scary in the dark.

20:03.398 --> 20:05.971
I know.
'Cause I was scared too.

20:06.058 --> 20:08.980
And I panicked so much,
I made a tunnel cave in.

20:09.067 --> 20:10.376
You did?

20:10.463 --> 20:12.645
Yeah. But someone taught me

20:12.732 --> 20:14.660
that the dark only seems scary

20:14.747 --> 20:17.377
because we imagine
scary things in it.

20:17.464 --> 20:20.595
I do imagine
scary things in the dark.

20:20.682 --> 20:22.420
Lots of scary things.

20:22.507 --> 20:24.943
Me too. But they're not real.

20:25.543 --> 20:27.021
You just need to remember...

20:27.108 --> 20:29.252
"There's nothing to fear
down here."

20:29.554 --> 20:32.939
"There's nothing to fear
down here."

20:33.195 --> 20:35.584
Right. And you know
what else helped me?

20:35.671 --> 20:37.056
My friends stuck with me.

20:37.143 --> 20:39.198
Just like I'm going
to stick with you.

20:39.577 --> 20:42.431
Because we're friends?

20:42.518 --> 20:43.593
Exactly.

20:45.141 --> 20:47.416
Best friends?

20:48.084 --> 20:50.029
Sure. Best friends.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.228
Now let's go home.
Together.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.030
Wow.

20:55.117 --> 20:57.252
I thought I was
her best friend.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.092
See? We did it. We're home.

21:00.179 --> 21:02.897
And I've got
a new best friend.

21:02.984 --> 21:05.250
Wait till I tell the herd.

21:07.029 --> 21:08.926
You were amazing, Tiifu.

21:09.013 --> 21:10.016
Definitely.

21:10.103 --> 21:11.447
You saved the day.

21:11.632 --> 21:13.494
I just knew
how the zebra felt.

21:13.581 --> 21:15.174
But, it's funny.

21:15.261 --> 21:16.592
When I was helping him?

21:16.679 --> 21:18.066
I wasn't scared at all.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.412
Kion! Bunga!
There you are!

21:20.499 --> 21:22.905
We just put out the fire
by the mud pots.

21:22.992 --> 21:25.479
We were so worried
when we didn't see you guys.

21:25.566 --> 21:26.557
Are you okay?

21:26.644 --> 21:27.590
We're fine.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.315
But the fire was huge.

21:29.402 --> 21:30.756
How did you get away?

21:30.843 --> 21:32.879
It's kind of a long story.

21:32.966 --> 21:36.392
Yeah. With a mole,
an aardvark and a zebra in it.

21:37.136 --> 21:40.000
You mean that zebra?

21:40.087 --> 21:42.947
Ooh.
I wonder what's in here?

21:44.323 --> 21:45.863
Help! Help!

21:45.950 --> 21:48.275
It's dark and I'm trapped!

21:48.468 --> 21:50.429
It's okay. I've got this.

21:51.663 --> 21:52.988
Don't panic, zebra.

21:53.075 --> 21:55.434
Your best friend's
coming to get you.

21:55.749 --> 21:58.447
There's nothing
to fear down here.
