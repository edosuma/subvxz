00:11.769 --> 00:13.704
Let me fucking go, Mike!

00:13.704 --> 00:15.640
We have a spare room upstairs.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.276
We don't need her trouble
becomin' our trouble.

00:20.211 --> 00:21.646
Who ordered this?

00:21.646 --> 00:24.182
Nobody, man.
That's the fuckin' problem.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.517
There's no leaders inside, Mike.

00:26.517 --> 00:28.820
<i>Not one shot caller in
the whole goddamn camp.</i>

00:28.820 --> 00:31.089
<i>We can't get no messages
in or out.</i>

00:31.089 --> 00:32.690
I have an idea.

00:32.690 --> 00:34.425
And you're gonna have to trust
me, 'cause it's gonna sting.

00:34.425 --> 00:35.626
Hey...

00:37.962 --> 00:38.896
She's gone.

00:38.896 --> 00:39.997
Gone?

00:40.698 --> 00:42.567
What if I can get you
the leaders of all four gangs?

00:42.567 --> 00:43.935
<i>Everyone that's at war.</i>

00:43.935 --> 00:45.703
How long they
planning on holding us?

00:45.703 --> 00:46.938
How long is it
gonna take you

00:46.938 --> 00:48.606
to get your house
together inside?

00:48.606 --> 00:50.408
- Not long.
- Ice cold, Mike.

00:50.408 --> 00:51.809
Name another way.

00:59.650 --> 01:00.918
I have no home.

01:00.918 --> 01:02.053
You are home.

01:05.423 --> 01:06.657
Are you Mike?

01:07.358 --> 02:14.653
I am.

02:14.653 --> 02:16.288
Did you speak to Candace?

02:23.262 --> 02:24.363
I did.

02:25.631 --> 02:27.332
She told you it was just me.

02:28.434 --> 02:29.368
She did.

02:33.672 --> 02:35.040
I wouldn't lie to you.

02:36.141 --> 02:37.109
I know.

02:37.843 --> 02:39.878
I worked some hotels
in Lansing.

02:39.878 --> 02:41.880
I just needed some time,
you know?

02:43.716 --> 02:44.950
I thought you were dead,

02:45.884 --> 02:47.753
in the riot, so...

02:48.954 --> 02:50.322
I didn't know where to go.

02:52.658 --> 02:53.826
No Mike?

02:56.095 --> 02:57.029
Fuck Mike.

02:57.529 --> 02:58.831
Did you?

02:59.098 --> 03:00.065
What?

03:02.134 --> 03:03.135
No.

03:04.069 --> 03:05.537
I believe you, Iris.

03:06.171 --> 03:08.307
I'm going to sleep, I'm tired.

03:12.511 --> 03:15.981
We can deal with tomorrow
when tomorrow's here.

04:56.715 --> 04:57.916
Go on.

05:12.197 --> 05:13.465
Get the fuck
on the ground!

05:13.465 --> 05:14.633
Get down, lay down!

05:14.633 --> 05:16.134
Get that gun out of
my face, boy.

05:16.134 --> 05:18.837
I'm too damn old to be gettin'
on my knees for anybody.

05:21.373 --> 05:23.609
Fuckers in there, they'd better
not break my shit!

05:29.381 --> 05:32.317
Lower the weapons!
Stevie, can we get her a chair?

05:35.754 --> 05:37.122
You know who my grandson is.

05:37.122 --> 05:39.625
I do, ma'am, yes.
That's why we're here.

05:40.926 --> 05:42.861
I know you got your hands full
with the kids.

05:42.861 --> 05:45.030
We'll be in and out real quick,
I promise.

06:05.984 --> 06:07.319
<i></i> Fuck me.

06:08.687 --> 06:10.188
Oh, boy.

06:12.057 --> 06:13.458
You put her at your mom's!

06:13.759 --> 06:14.927
Yeah!

06:15.727 --> 06:17.296
- I did.
- And she just...

06:17.296 --> 06:18.196
ran away.

06:18.196 --> 06:19.798
Yeah, like I fuckin' said!

06:19.798 --> 06:21.667
And you have no idea
where she went.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.068
No.
No idea.

06:23.535 --> 06:25.203
So, it appears that
neither one of us

06:25.203 --> 06:27.139
know how to look after her.
Right?

06:27.139 --> 06:28.340
So I'm gonna go to work.

06:28.340 --> 06:29.875
You can fuck off
and do whatever you do.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.576
Hey, you're a federal informant.

06:31.576 --> 06:34.313
- Can you fuckin' save it?
- We pay you to inform.

06:34.313 --> 06:37.115
Okay, I'll inform you
I don't know fuckin' shit!

06:38.483 --> 06:41.453
If Milo Sunter's out there,
he will find her.

06:41.453 --> 06:44.356
Do what you gotta do, okay?
I'll do what I do.

06:44.723 --> 06:45.857
And I'll tell you this...

06:46.425 --> 06:47.960
If you forced her to testify...

06:48.393 --> 06:51.163
he will kill her,
and who fuckin' wins then?

06:59.705 --> 07:01.573
Fuck.

07:01.573 --> 07:02.674
What did I do?

07:02.941 --> 07:04.309
You want some coffee?

07:05.510 --> 07:06.712
Yeah, yeah.

07:07.813 --> 07:09.448
That'd be great.
Love some coffee.

07:15.654 --> 07:16.588
Appreciate it.

07:20.959 --> 07:22.494
Yeah?
What, what?

07:22.494 --> 07:24.763
I don't doubt what hell
that girl's been though,

07:24.763 --> 07:26.531
but it's not yours to live in.

07:27.666 --> 07:30.168
Look, Rebecca, I'm not tryin'
to live in that shit, okay?

07:30.168 --> 07:32.337
I'm just tryin' to get her
the fuck out of it.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.508
You look lovely,
good morning,

07:36.508 --> 07:37.642
and all that bullshit!

07:37.642 --> 07:38.677
Thank you!

07:42.381 --> 07:43.348
Yeah?

07:44.483 --> 07:45.417
What?

07:47.319 --> 07:48.286
When?

07:50.355 --> 07:51.990
You're fucking kidding me!

07:58.697 --> 08:00.332
What in the fuck?

08:02.267 --> 08:03.101
Hey!

08:03.101 --> 08:05.137
Do you listen to
anything I say?!

08:05.137 --> 08:06.738
Look where you are.
You gotta keep it down.

08:06.738 --> 08:08.206
You fuckin' raided the Commons!

08:08.206 --> 08:10.909
Hey, CI told us that there was
illegal drug activity.

08:10.909 --> 08:12.177
Are you kidding me?!

08:12.177 --> 08:14.179
When is there not
fuckin' drug activity?!

08:14.179 --> 08:15.781
Use your fuckin' heads,
you guys!

08:15.781 --> 08:17.115
Jesus Christ!

08:18.150 --> 08:19.851
I negotiated the deal!

08:19.851 --> 08:22.821
You don't attack them while
the leaders are inside!

08:22.821 --> 08:24.256
Bunny takes a hit for us.

08:24.256 --> 08:25.824
- What the fuck?!
- Takes a hit, Mike!

08:25.824 --> 08:27.125
He is a drug dealer.

08:27.125 --> 08:28.293
Just 'cause he's
your fuckin' drug dealer...

08:28.293 --> 08:29.828
I don't know what to
tell ya.

08:29.828 --> 08:31.396
He's inside, working for us.

08:31.396 --> 08:33.298
Let's not forget that,
fuck heads.

08:33.298 --> 08:35.567
He's not gonna do fuckin'
shit all for us

08:35.567 --> 08:37.269
if you're goin' down
and bustin' down

08:37.269 --> 08:38.670
- his grandma's fuckin' door!
- Mikey...

08:38.670 --> 08:41.873
We were fuckin' super
fuckin' respectful.

08:41.873 --> 08:43.675
- Very respectful.
- Very respectful.

08:43.675 --> 08:44.976
I took it fuckin' easy!

08:44.976 --> 08:46.845
You dipshits, this'll start
a war out here.

08:46.845 --> 08:48.013
Is that what you want?

08:48.013 --> 08:49.114
You want us to
stop bein' police?

08:49.114 --> 08:50.515
Is that what you want?

08:50.515 --> 08:51.450
Fuck them!

08:51.450 --> 08:52.751
- Fuck them?
- Fuck them.

08:52.751 --> 08:54.052
- Fuck you.
- Fuck them.

08:54.052 --> 08:55.287
We're this fuckin' close
to getting it done, okay?

08:55.287 --> 08:56.288
Fuck them, okay?
Fuck them.

08:56.288 --> 08:57.389
- Fuck them!
- Hey, hey.

08:57.389 --> 08:58.857
Fuckin'...
calm the fuck down.

08:58.857 --> 09:00.058
We're this close.

09:00.058 --> 09:01.326
Mike, we're on
the same goddamn team.

09:01.326 --> 09:03.261
Yeah, you're makin' my job
fuckin' harder.

09:04.629 --> 09:06.765
I'm not your fuckin' janitor,
you cunt!

09:06.765 --> 09:07.766
Fuck you!

09:17.303 --> 09:20.740
It's hot as a motherfucker
in this bitch, man, shit.

09:22.241 --> 09:24.010
Sun's barely up, Bun.

09:24.510 --> 09:26.446
You gon' sweat out
all your toxins.

09:26.446 --> 09:29.182
Yeah, my body's a temple
and all that shit, right?

09:32.952 --> 09:34.621
Bunny Washington!

09:38.124 --> 09:39.559
Fuck that cracker, bruh.

09:40.326 --> 09:41.861
You ain't here to answer
to his shit.

09:42.462 --> 09:44.597
That motherfucker one of
Mike's boys.

09:45.932 --> 09:48.234
He probably got some
instructions or some shit.

09:48.234 --> 09:50.903
You don't need no instructions
on how to run this shit.

09:52.372 --> 09:54.307
The way I see it,
Mike is the last fuckin' dude

09:54.307 --> 09:55.708
that should be givin'
instructions.

09:56.476 --> 09:58.878
His shit is what got
shit twisted in the first place.

09:58.878 --> 10:00.179
Listen.

10:01.414 --> 10:03.783
From now on, we gonna trust
that Mike got a plan

10:03.783 --> 10:04.851
to make this shit right.

10:06.386 --> 10:08.955
All this shit shake out,
and we get our pound.

10:08.955 --> 10:10.723
Let's fucking go!

10:10.723 --> 10:12.425
If it don't go his way...

10:14.894 --> 10:16.496
We run it like we do.

10:17.730 --> 10:21.034
Bunny Washington!
I ain't got all day!

10:21.834 --> 10:24.704
This motherfucker screamin'
my name like I owe him money.

10:42.288 --> 10:43.623
Hey.

10:45.591 --> 10:47.527
Wanna take this shit off him?

10:47.527 --> 10:48.795
You don't wanna
do that.

10:48.795 --> 10:50.897
Man's right.
You don't wanna do that.

10:56.402 --> 10:58.337
- Bunny...
- Mm-hmm?

11:03.209 --> 11:04.477
Let me out, Mike.

11:05.812 --> 11:07.547
I'm workin' on it, okay?

11:08.881 --> 11:12.618
Get your shit settled in here,
I'll settle mine outside.

11:12.618 --> 11:13.720
Shit is settled.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.121
Shit is never gettin' settled,
Mike.

11:15.488 --> 11:17.523
I'm just fingerin' dykes
in here, bruh.

11:19.425 --> 11:21.294
I'm in here linin' it out, right?

11:21.294 --> 11:22.295
Doin' your shit.

11:22.295 --> 11:23.730
I want assurances.

11:24.964 --> 11:26.365
I'm fuckin' workin' on it.

11:26.365 --> 11:28.034
Your word don't mean shit
to me no more.

11:28.501 --> 11:29.969
I don't wanna hear working.

11:32.004 --> 11:34.774
I'm gonna get something from
the assistant DA next week.

11:34.774 --> 11:35.842
Okay?

11:37.710 --> 11:38.678
Listen to me.

11:39.879 --> 11:43.382
What do you need in here
to make things right?

11:46.486 --> 11:48.554
Some chips gotta get
knocked off.

11:49.622 --> 11:51.724
My cousin will run point
when I get out.

11:52.191 --> 11:53.559
Yeah, what do you need from me?

11:54.694 --> 11:57.363
Backs turned,
5 o'clock tomorrow.

11:58.297 --> 11:59.465
Fine.

12:02.268 --> 12:03.636
You check in on mine?

12:05.705 --> 12:07.840
Cell phone shop is
up and running.

12:08.674 --> 12:10.276
My people?

12:11.310 --> 12:12.812
They're taken care of.

12:14.013 --> 12:15.782
Shit, bruh, you do
a motherfucker like this...

12:15.782 --> 12:18.050
it's gonna take a long-ass time
to bury this hatchet, Mike.

12:18.050 --> 12:19.552
Yeah, I know.

12:21.354 --> 12:23.055
Keep it tight, get it done.
Okay?

12:28.427 --> 12:29.762
Five at five.
Okay?

12:29.762 --> 12:30.963
Tomorrow.

12:31.631 --> 12:33.533
- I can do that.
- Yeah.

12:34.033 --> 12:34.901
Kareem?

12:35.401 --> 12:37.103
Keep him insulated.
He's the management now.

13:16.442 --> 13:18.211
What the fuck?

13:53.946 --> 13:55.381
Jesus Christ.

13:55.781 --> 13:57.283
Fuckin' good to see ya.

13:57.283 --> 13:58.651
Hey, good to see you!

13:58.918 --> 14:00.620
Finally banished you fuckers, huh?

14:00.620 --> 14:01.787
You decided to come in?

14:01.787 --> 14:03.289
- Well, well, huh?
- Nice to see ya.

14:03.289 --> 14:04.357
- How you doin', huh?
- Yeah.

14:04.357 --> 14:05.524
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

14:05.524 --> 14:07.193
- Good!
- Hey, thank you.

14:07.193 --> 14:09.262
Can I talk to you for a minute?

14:09.695 --> 14:11.330
Stevie, just get these fuckers
back to work.

14:11.330 --> 14:12.665
Happy time's over, people.

14:12.665 --> 14:13.933
- That's it?
- Yep, that's it.

14:13.933 --> 14:15.167
That's it.

14:15.167 --> 14:16.869
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

14:16.869 --> 14:18.704
Well, what do you want?
A coffee, you want a doughnut?

14:18.704 --> 14:20.206
- You want...?
- Nah, nah, I'm good, I'm good.

14:20.206 --> 14:21.540
I just...

14:22.308 --> 14:23.809
You know, I just need a minute.

14:24.277 --> 14:25.978
Fuck, it's good to be back here.

14:28.147 --> 14:29.882
It's fuckin' great to see you.

14:30.516 --> 14:31.951
You too, man.

14:37.857 --> 14:38.991
You're good?

14:40.426 --> 14:42.094
Fuckers suspended me.

14:42.461 --> 14:44.063
Pending the investigation.

14:44.397 --> 14:45.665
No pay, and...

14:46.132 --> 14:48.401
It's like, they know I got
a kid on the way, and I said,

14:48.401 --> 14:49.936
"Fuck you motherfuckers.
I quit."

14:49.936 --> 14:51.337
You did the right thing.
Fuck them.

14:51.337 --> 14:52.705
You need to be here.

14:52.705 --> 14:55.074
We need more fuckin' soldiers
on the street.

14:55.074 --> 14:56.475
That's what I want.

14:56.475 --> 14:58.277
I mean, what do we gotta do
to make that happen?

14:58.277 --> 15:00.112
You gotta fuckin'
be patient.

15:00.846 --> 15:02.248
They're not gonna put you
back on the street

15:02.248 --> 15:04.617
until the staties call this
a righteous fuckin' shoot.

15:04.617 --> 15:06.252
It fuckin' was
a righteous shoot!

15:06.252 --> 15:08.054
Fuckin' bureaucratic bullshit.

15:08.054 --> 15:09.422
But...

15:09.422 --> 15:11.324
you gotta fuckin' keep
your head down.

15:11.958 --> 15:14.360
Until the IA report
comes back clean.

15:14.994 --> 15:17.363
Once that happens,
you're fuckin' golden.

15:17.730 --> 15:20.166
I'm dyin' in here, man.
It's...

15:20.166 --> 15:21.901
This is home for me.
You know?

15:22.301 --> 15:23.703
You talkin' to anybody?

15:25.838 --> 15:27.907
Are you fuckin' talkin'
to anybody?

15:28.941 --> 15:30.309
I got a fuckin' empty apartment,

15:30.309 --> 15:32.011
I got a fuckin'
ex-girlfriend's cat.

15:32.011 --> 15:34.313
Neither one of 'em
will talk to me, all right?

15:34.313 --> 15:36.615
You got fuckin' shit
to work for.

15:36.615 --> 15:38.417
You have got a fuckin' wife
who loves you.

15:38.417 --> 15:39.752
You have got a kid on the way.

15:39.752 --> 15:42.321
I don't need a shrink, Ian.
I need a job.

15:42.321 --> 15:44.023
Brother, I got you.
All right?

15:47.560 --> 15:48.728
- All right.
- All right?

15:48.728 --> 15:50.029
- All right.
- I got ya.

15:50.029 --> 15:51.063
- I know.
- All right?

15:51.063 --> 15:52.198
Okay.

16:04.304 --> 16:07.508
KPD can't take me back
until IA clears me,

16:07.508 --> 16:09.743
and that's probably gonna take
a couple months.

16:09.743 --> 16:12.412
And it's like, I don't have
a fuckin' couple months, Mike.

16:12.412 --> 16:13.881
I...

16:13.881 --> 16:16.216
I need somethin', man.
I, I, I gotta fuckin' earn.

16:18.785 --> 16:20.454
Well, why don't you just take
a fuckin' break, right?

16:20.454 --> 16:21.755
Put a pause on this shit.

16:21.755 --> 16:23.957
I take a break,
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

16:23.957 --> 16:26.460
I gotta stay busy.
I'm already losin' it.

16:26.460 --> 16:28.061
You know, why don't you do
shit around here?

16:28.061 --> 16:29.129
Help Ma out, right?

16:29.129 --> 16:30.631
Fix the doors, the gates,
mow the lawn,

16:30.631 --> 16:31.865
that kinda shit, right?

16:31.865 --> 16:33.066
Fuck you, don't brush me off
like that.

16:33.066 --> 16:34.601
All right, look,
if you want a chore,

16:34.601 --> 16:35.736
I can give you a chore.

16:35.736 --> 16:37.604
Yes, that's what I want.
What you got?

16:39.540 --> 16:42.042
Check the train station,
bus depot, taxis.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.010
All that.

16:43.577 --> 16:45.812
Ma gave her a list
of shelters, check those.

16:47.014 --> 16:48.682
Can't find Iris?

16:48.916 --> 16:49.917
Nope.

16:49.917 --> 16:51.251
Oh, Mike...

16:53.820 --> 16:56.790
You gotta give that to
the feds, or somethin', to KPD.

16:56.790 --> 16:58.258
'Cause I tell you what,

16:58.258 --> 17:00.527
she's probably back in
New York or wherever the fuck,

17:00.527 --> 17:02.195
livin' her best fuckin' life.

17:03.297 --> 17:04.598
Best case scenario,

17:04.598 --> 17:06.767
she's put miles between
Kingstown and herself.

17:08.001 --> 17:09.970
'Cause if she's still here...

17:11.905 --> 17:13.907
Well, that's what
I'm tryin' to find out.

17:13.907 --> 17:14.975
Okay?

18:00.954 --> 18:02.756
Knock, knock.

18:06.326 --> 18:07.794
Hey.

18:10.230 --> 18:11.331
Let him in.

18:17.904 --> 18:19.339
What do you want, Mike?

18:19.339 --> 18:20.707
Just checkin' in on you.

18:24.411 --> 18:25.746
Makin' sure you're okay.

18:26.380 --> 18:27.314
Mm-hm.

18:31.785 --> 18:33.153
You talk to him yet?

18:34.187 --> 18:35.155
Who?

18:36.890 --> 18:39.459
He wasn't identified on
the inside, so...

18:40.060 --> 18:41.328
Oh...

18:41.595 --> 18:42.496
Yeah.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.563
A lot of bodies.

18:43.563 --> 18:45.699
Oh, cut the shit, Joseph.
Come on.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.301
You and I both know
that he's out.

18:49.036 --> 18:51.338
I would love to see
my friend free.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.339
Is that right, your friend?

18:52.339 --> 18:54.274
Milo values loyalty.

18:54.274 --> 18:56.843
And I am loyal above all.

18:57.411 --> 19:00.414
Well, nine years...
You're his errand boy.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.083
Nothin' you can do now
that he can't.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.251
Right?

19:06.887 --> 19:08.889
Is that a fuckin' baby?

19:09.623 --> 19:10.924
I hear nothing.

19:10.924 --> 19:11.792
No?

19:12.192 --> 19:13.760
What do you want, Mike?

19:17.864 --> 19:19.132
What'd you do with her?

19:20.167 --> 19:21.234
Who?

19:22.569 --> 19:23.837
Did you kill her?

19:27.774 --> 19:30.977
Mike, when whore talks to feds...

19:31.645 --> 19:33.246
What do you think happens?

19:45.492 --> 19:46.860
Stop.

19:50.864 --> 19:53.033
Get out.
<i>Pashla von!</i>

19:55.602 --> 19:56.770
I'll be back.

19:57.871 --> 19:59.139
You can count on it.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.077
<i>Tell me you got
some movement.</i>

20:37.611 --> 20:38.612
Hey, Mike!

20:38.612 --> 20:40.080
I'm fine, how are you?

20:40.080 --> 20:42.315
Just give me somethin', Evelyn.
Come on.

20:42.315 --> 20:43.283
I'm workin' the boss,

20:43.283 --> 20:45.051
everything's good
as far as I know.

20:45.485 --> 20:47.220
Well, that doesn't really
fucking help me.

20:47.687 --> 20:49.923
You know, I made promises.
I need release dates.

20:49.923 --> 20:51.591
<i>Well, maybe
you shouldn't have done that.</i>

20:51.591 --> 20:52.793
A lot of paper to be pushed.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.228
Listen, I need you to
see something.

20:55.228 --> 20:56.363
<i>Right now?</i>

20:57.264 --> 20:57.998
30 minutes.

20:58.265 --> 21:00.066
Meet me at Warwick Detention.

21:00.066 --> 21:01.968
I can't.
I got, I got shit to do.

21:01.968 --> 21:03.303
<i>Hey, this is for you.</i>

21:03.303 --> 21:05.839
The world is changing,
and you need to see it.

21:10.777 --> 21:13.146
Fine, I'm comin'.
Fine.

21:44.477 --> 21:45.478
Get out.

21:48.481 --> 21:49.616
Are you finished?

21:50.116 --> 21:51.518
<i>Ya tol'ko nachal.</i>

21:51.518 --> 21:54.120
<i>Mne platiat ne za skorost',
a za zdelannuiu rabotu.</i>

22:04.698 --> 22:06.366
To numb the area.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.374
Hold still, please.

22:17.477 --> 22:19.045
This is your new home.

22:19.980 --> 22:22.782
You have a bed, safe, closet.

22:23.350 --> 22:25.585
You will make $5,000 a night.

22:25.819 --> 22:27.954
If you make eight, good for you.

22:28.455 --> 22:31.291
If you make four,
we have a problem.

22:40.333 --> 22:41.501
Warwick Detention is

22:41.501 --> 22:44.471
the sole private
penial institution in Kingstown.

22:44.471 --> 22:46.907
Warwick Group has run it
since 2018,

22:47.507 --> 22:50.644
and it is the only prison that
saw no violence during the riot.

22:51.177 --> 22:53.747
It's easy to see no violence
when you have no yard time,

22:53.747 --> 22:57.951
no education service,
no cafeteria, no commissary...

22:58.485 --> 23:00.987
Sounds like you're describing
Tent City, Mr. Moore.

23:00.987 --> 23:02.589
How's that no violence
workin' out?

23:02.589 --> 23:04.324
It's a unique situation.

23:05.225 --> 23:06.826
Well, in the next
three years,

23:06.826 --> 23:08.862
Kingstown will be repaired
and retrofitted.

23:09.262 --> 23:11.531
In the next five years,
every prison in Kingstown

23:11.531 --> 23:13.767
will be contracted to
the Warwick Group.

23:14.868 --> 23:17.137
She's out of her fuckin' mind.
That'll never happen.

23:17.137 --> 23:19.272
It is happening, Mike.
That's why I wanted you to come.

23:19.539 --> 23:21.207
They're still debating
in Lansing.

23:21.207 --> 23:22.208
Right?

23:22.208 --> 23:23.877
Report on the riot's
not even out.

23:23.877 --> 23:26.646
Warwick's doing the report.
You should get to know them.

23:26.646 --> 23:28.014
Are we boring you back there?

23:28.014 --> 23:30.183
No, it's great.
Fuckin' interesting.

23:30.183 --> 23:31.952
Tent City is temporary.

23:32.352 --> 23:34.387
And Warwick is
a permanent solution.

23:34.387 --> 23:35.922
So we're gonna bring some of
your inmates

23:35.922 --> 23:37.357
to Anchor Bay in the next week,

23:37.357 --> 23:39.726
and the rest of the overflow
will come here.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.062
You're overbooked already.

23:42.062 --> 23:43.496
Well, we know how to warehouse.

23:43.496 --> 23:46.333
We have facilities in
other counties, other states...

23:48.168 --> 23:49.469
She's like a fuckin'
real estate agent.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.871
This is fuckin' ridiculous.
Look at these guys.

23:51.871 --> 23:53.606
Look like they're on
fuckin' safari.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.076
Fuck me.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.810
First day back is fun, yeah?

24:23.845 --> 24:27.815
Like riding a bicycle,
but the pay's better.

24:30.184 --> 24:31.586
I'm Tati.

24:31.586 --> 24:33.221
You have a problem with
the other girls,

24:33.221 --> 24:34.455
you come to me.

24:35.189 --> 24:36.558
You need anything...

24:37.559 --> 24:38.560
Let me know.

24:40.695 --> 24:42.130
You did good already.

24:43.097 --> 24:44.632
You're going to do fine.

24:45.867 --> 24:46.968
Baby.

24:47.335 --> 24:48.836
Does Milo come by?

24:50.672 --> 24:51.606
Who?

24:53.942 --> 24:55.143
We're gonna do this?

24:56.044 --> 24:57.445
He does not.

24:58.346 --> 24:59.747
Well, can I go to him?

25:00.982 --> 25:02.350
When he calls.

25:08.990 --> 25:10.858
You got shit on you, Tati?

25:10.858 --> 25:12.093
What kinda shit?

25:12.093 --> 25:13.294
The kinda shit that makes
today feel like

25:13.294 --> 25:15.263
I'm hopin' tomorrow might.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.366
Hope is good.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.768
Hope dies, we die.

26:06.180 --> 26:07.415
Yeah.

26:08.883 --> 26:09.951
How bad?

26:13.054 --> 26:14.489
And you're tellin' me now?

26:15.823 --> 26:17.358
Fine, I'm on my way.

26:18.059 --> 26:19.327
Bad news?

26:25.266 --> 26:26.567
I know you?

26:27.068 --> 26:28.703
I know where she is.

26:30.071 --> 26:31.205
She's in trouble.

26:31.773 --> 26:33.975
She won't perform,
and she'll be punished for it,

26:33.975 --> 26:35.710
or she'll perform
to punish herself.

26:37.278 --> 26:38.446
She with Milo?

26:38.446 --> 26:40.114
Milo's dead, I think.

26:40.415 --> 26:41.816
Your people killed him.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.522
Good talkin' to you.
I got shit to do.

26:47.522 --> 26:49.891
You wanna put on
a cape and save this girl,

26:49.891 --> 26:51.459
I can leave a door open for you.

26:52.226 --> 26:54.295
In the alley at the club.

29:15.097 --> 29:17.032
What are you looking
for, Mike?

29:19.101 --> 29:21.303
You know I'm lookin' for
a lot of things, Joseph.

29:21.670 --> 29:23.605
And let's just save that shit
for another day.

29:23.605 --> 29:26.008
- What do you say?
- You might not have another day.

29:26.942 --> 29:29.144
None of what you're looking for
is here.

29:29.578 --> 29:31.980
Your girlfriend is probably dead
by a dumpster

29:31.980 --> 29:34.450
with a fucking needle hanging
out of her arm.

29:35.217 --> 29:36.885
Or in a rich man's bed.

29:36.885 --> 29:38.187
That your baby?

29:39.188 --> 29:41.957
That baby is none of
your fucking business.

29:41.957 --> 29:43.826
Then maybe you don't want to
send the mother

29:44.059 --> 29:45.194
to do your damn job.

29:46.161 --> 29:48.731
Does Milo know that
you're back on the town?

29:48.731 --> 29:50.599
You're a funny guy, Mike.

29:55.537 --> 29:57.139
Fuck off, put it down.

29:57.873 --> 30:01.210
Tell your fuckin' boss that
I know he's out...

30:02.277 --> 30:03.579
And I'm gonna find him.

30:08.350 --> 30:11.587

Hey, where is he?

33:24.379 --> 33:26.415
Jesus, what the fuck
happened to you?

33:33.755 --> 33:36.158
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Bunny.

33:41.563 --> 33:42.798
Looks like the plan's
workin', huh?

33:42.798 --> 33:44.866
I got no humor, Mike. Not...

33:45.567 --> 33:47.135
Not a fuckin' lick.

33:47.636 --> 33:49.037
You thought I wasn't gon' hear?

33:49.605 --> 33:50.839
Huh?

33:51.773 --> 33:54.242
They raid my home,
they terrorize my family,

33:54.242 --> 33:56.311
and you don't tell me.

33:56.612 --> 33:57.913
I didn't know about it, Bunny.

33:57.913 --> 33:59.481
Fuck you didn't know, Mike?

33:59.481 --> 34:02.317
You need to know.
You needed me.

34:02.784 --> 34:04.386
You too chicken shit
to talk straight.

34:04.386 --> 34:05.654
I thought we was past that.

34:05.654 --> 34:07.823
Let's not make this about
friends, all right?

34:07.823 --> 34:08.957
We're not friends.

34:08.957 --> 34:10.292
Yeah, that's for
damn sure.

34:10.292 --> 34:11.927
This will break down, Mike.

34:11.927 --> 34:13.729
Might not be no comin' back
from this shit.

34:14.029 --> 34:15.464
Get me the fuck outta here,

34:15.464 --> 34:16.832
or there's gonna be
some payback.

34:16.832 --> 34:19.101
And no, I don't mean
no fuckin' guards on the inside.

34:19.101 --> 34:21.269
Or them cops on the street.
Nuh-uh, nuh-uh.

34:21.269 --> 34:23.005
This shit's gonna hit
close to home.

34:23.005 --> 34:24.673
All right, come on.
Let's not go there.

34:24.673 --> 34:26.108
You already fuckin' did, Mike.

34:26.108 --> 34:27.876
You have to understand
this is not me.

34:27.876 --> 34:29.211
It was fucking KPD.

34:29.211 --> 34:30.245
What good are you, Mike?

34:30.245 --> 34:31.780
You can't even control
your own people.

34:31.780 --> 34:33.482
This wasn't supposed to happen,
you understand me?

34:33.482 --> 34:34.783
I done my piece.
All right?

34:34.783 --> 34:37.219
You got 48 hours.
Get my ass back on the street.

34:38.754 --> 34:39.855
I'm workin' on mine.

34:40.322 --> 34:42.958
You know my shit damn near
fucking ended today?

34:44.226 --> 34:46.228
Get me the fuck outta here, Mike.

34:47.696 --> 34:48.830
I'll make it happen.

34:48.830 --> 34:50.866
You can't protect me.

34:50.866 --> 34:52.467
My people, nah.

34:52.968 --> 34:54.369
So I gotta do it.

34:55.003 --> 34:57.339
Get me the fuck outta here.

34:57.806 --> 34:59.041
You owe me that.

34:59.841 --> 35:01.743
You fucking owe me, Mike.

35:15.924 --> 35:17.959
Nobody touches fucking Bunny.

35:18.694 --> 35:20.896
Okay, I want you to make it
your personal fuckin' mission.

35:20.896 --> 35:23.899
He is the biggest swingin' dick
on this yard, Mike.

35:23.899 --> 35:25.767
He's an ally and he made good
on his end.

35:25.767 --> 35:28.003
Okay, so whatever the fuck
happens to him now...

35:28.437 --> 35:29.438
happens to you.

35:30.439 --> 35:31.606
Understand?

35:31.606 --> 35:32.974
He gets hurt,
you're gonna get hurt.

35:32.974 --> 35:34.476
He bleeds, you bleed.

35:35.510 --> 35:36.578
Yeah.

35:37.045 --> 35:39.214
This motherfuckin'...

36:00.951 --> 36:03.020
<i>Next time on</i>
Mayor of Kingstown...

36:03.020 --> 36:04.855
<i>You made deals
with Bunny Washington</i>

36:04.855 --> 36:06.156
<i>and the other generals.</i>

36:06.156 --> 36:07.624
Deals with my name in your
fucking mouth.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.259
<i>They movin' people,
Mike.</i>

36:09.259 --> 36:10.727
I'm getting you
the fuck out.

36:10.727 --> 36:11.895
You have my word.

36:11.895 --> 36:13.163
You're losin' your
fucking mojo!

36:13.163 --> 36:14.765
Lady said her husband
dug up a box of these

36:14.765 --> 36:16.266
at his worksite.

36:16.266 --> 36:17.367
You just found this?

36:17.367 --> 36:19.369
Milo's gonna come
lookin' for what's his.

36:19.369 --> 36:22.005
Are you gonna be a problem
in our clan, Iris?

36:22.005 --> 36:23.674
You're lookin' to burn
this whole house down.

36:23.674 --> 36:25.642
Tell your boy to do
his fuckin' job.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.711
<i>They comin' for you.</i>

36:27.711 --> 36:29.846
There's gonna be some payback.
