WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:05.000
(opening theme playing)

00:10.000 --> 00:12.667
All right, ladies.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.667
Have a good day at school.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.125
-Hey!

00:12.750 --> 00:14.125
-(screams)

00:14.500 --> 00:16.208
Aren't you supposed

00:14.500 --> 00:16.208
to be watching your cholesterol?

00:16.709 --> 00:17.625
Heather!

00:17.875 --> 00:19.834
Samantha's talking back to me!

00:19.917 --> 00:23.208
HEATHER: Samantha,

00:19.917 --> 00:23.208
stop talking back to your dad!

00:23.291 --> 00:24.750
Dad's eating a cinnamon bun!

00:24.834 --> 00:27.333
HEATHER: Tim, knock it off!

00:24.834 --> 00:27.333
Your cholesterol!

00:28.917 --> 00:31.250
This is Mom's world, we just live in it.

00:33.375 --> 00:36.000
Well, there was a time

00:33.375 --> 00:36.000
where it was my... world.

00:37.917 --> 00:41.208
Hey, hey, guess who picked up Cinnabons!

00:41.291 --> 00:44.291
Had to go all the way to LAX to get them,

00:41.291 --> 00:44.291
but it was worth it.

00:44.375 --> 00:46.166
I really shouldn't, my diabetes.

00:46.250 --> 00:47.875
Hey, this is Tim's world, live a little.

00:48.875 --> 00:50.041
Who needs feet?

00:50.125 --> 00:51.625
Thanks, boss! How was your weekend?

00:51.709 --> 00:54.875
Aw, you know, sat through

00:51.709 --> 00:54.875
some soccer, a little ballet,

00:54.959 --> 00:57.250
got my mother-in-law high,

00:54.959 --> 00:57.250
you know, the uzh.

00:57.333 --> 00:58.875
I'm just glad to be back in the office.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.667
You know, they say everybody's

00:58.959 --> 01:00.667
working for the weekend?

01:00.750 --> 01:02.333
Well, I'm weekending for the work.

01:02.417 --> 01:05.750
(laughs, coughs)

01:05.834 --> 01:06.667
You okay?

01:07.333 --> 01:09.208
Yeah, I just got to stop thinking

01:07.333 --> 01:09.208
about the second one

01:09.291 --> 01:10.583
when I'm still eating the first.

01:11.208 --> 01:12.125
(clears throat)

01:12.208 --> 01:13.125
Where's Rose?

01:13.750 --> 01:15.375
(phone ringing)

01:15.458 --> 01:16.375
Doctor's office.

01:17.709 --> 01:18.542
Rose?

01:19.458 --> 01:20.959
Aren't you supposed to be here

01:19.458 --> 01:20.959
answering this?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.417
I understand,

01:22.250 --> 01:24.417
I'm doing the best I can, okay?

01:24.500 --> 01:27.542
Sweet mother, don't just stand there,

01:24.500 --> 01:27.542
do something!

01:27.625 --> 01:28.959
I'm not good in a crisis.

01:29.041 --> 01:31.375
Tim, hey, what's going on?

01:31.458 --> 01:32.792
I've been calling you for two hours.

01:32.875 --> 01:33.875
Nobody's answering your phone.

01:33.959 --> 01:34.834
Rose quit.

01:35.166 --> 01:36.542
Oh, I liked her.

01:36.625 --> 01:39.750
Well, apparently, she won a scratcher

01:36.625 --> 01:39.750
and finally got her other boob done.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.917
Now she's very sought-after

01:39.834 --> 01:41.917
in the receptionist community.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.125
I don't know how we're going to cope.

01:43.208 --> 01:44.041
-What are you doing?

01:43.208 --> 01:44.041
-Oh.

01:44.125 --> 01:44.959
(phone ringing)

01:45.625 --> 01:47.750
Hello, doctor's office,

01:45.625 --> 01:47.750
can you hold, please?

01:48.166 --> 01:49.083
You're a natural.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.542
I'll help you out until you find

01:49.375 --> 01:51.542
a new receptionist.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.458
Or until I get my boobs done.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.458
(clicks tongue)

01:54.834 --> 01:55.959
Is that an option?

01:56.417 --> 01:57.375
It hurts.

01:58.709 --> 02:00.542
You're all set, we'll see you next week.

02:00.625 --> 02:02.375
Okay, thank you. You, too, bye.

02:03.458 --> 02:04.417
Uh, Heather?

02:04.500 --> 02:05.333
Yeah?

02:05.750 --> 02:08.750
Uh, my father taught me

02:05.750 --> 02:08.750
to never compliment women.

02:09.083 --> 02:11.208
Oh, that's nice.

02:11.291 --> 02:15.291
But in this case, I have to say,

02:11.291 --> 02:15.291
you're doing an excellent job.

02:15.375 --> 02:16.208
Thank you.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.917
I'm only here till Friday, though,

02:16.500 --> 02:18.917
when the temp arrives.

02:19.000 --> 02:19.834
Oh, here.

02:20.250 --> 02:22.333
Oh, you have a sucker for me, thank you.

02:22.625 --> 02:23.625
That's sweet.

02:23.709 --> 02:26.542
Hey, babe, could you, uh, fill out

02:23.709 --> 02:26.542
this prescription for penicillin for me,

02:26.625 --> 02:29.375
and ask Sylvie to prep room three

02:26.625 --> 02:29.375
for a nasal endoscopy?

02:29.458 --> 02:30.375
(inhales slowly)

02:31.417 --> 02:34.625
(whispers) I love it when you get

02:31.417 --> 02:34.625
all doctor-y and you know stuff.

02:35.709 --> 02:37.083
-Yeah?

02:35.709 --> 02:37.083
-Yeah.

02:37.166 --> 02:39.542
Well, I love it when you get

02:37.166 --> 02:39.542
all reception-y

02:39.625 --> 02:42.458
-and fan out magazines.

02:39.625 --> 02:42.458
-Oh, yeah?

02:42.542 --> 02:43.375
Yeah.

02:43.625 --> 02:44.667
Mm.

02:45.417 --> 02:47.291
-(phone rings)

02:45.417 --> 02:47.291
-(mumbles over lollipop)

02:48.000 --> 02:49.500
(breathily) Hello, doctor's office.

02:49.583 --> 02:51.500
-Oh, my.

02:49.583 --> 02:51.500
-Uh-huh.

02:51.917 --> 02:52.917
Well, how big is that goiter?

02:53.208 --> 02:54.458
See, you're turning me on.

02:54.542 --> 02:58.000
Uh-huh. Yeah, Friday, two o'clock, two!

02:54.542 --> 02:58.000
Two, two, two, two! Let's go.

02:58.083 --> 03:00.166
Exam room three has fresh paper.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.458
(whispers) Not for long.

03:02.709 --> 03:06.166
So my very beautiful

03:02.709 --> 03:06.166
and limber receptionist Heather

03:06.250 --> 03:08.542
will schedule your follow-up appointment.

03:08.625 --> 03:10.583
I think the earliest we can get you in

03:08.625 --> 03:10.583
is next week.

03:10.917 --> 03:13.000
Uh, no, we can do Thursday at 3:00.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.750
No, I, I have something then,

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
-pretty sure.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
-W-What are you doing?

03:16.083 --> 03:17.375
-That won't work. What are you--?

03:16.083 --> 03:17.375
-Will you stop it?

03:17.458 --> 03:18.792
Stop, get out of my business.

03:18.875 --> 03:21.208
No, all you have on Thursday

03:18.875 --> 03:21.208
is a 1:00 p.m.

03:21.291 --> 03:22.417
with someone named Dave Buster.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.875
-Uh...

03:22.500 --> 03:24.875
-And then the next Thursday...

03:24.959 --> 03:26.458
Every... Thursday...

03:26.542 --> 03:27.625
He's very sick.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.667
We will call you with a time.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.542
Thank you so much for your patience.

03:33.625 --> 03:34.542
(laughs) Patience...

03:35.542 --> 03:37.208
Do you go to Dave and Buster's

03:35.542 --> 03:37.208
every Thursday at 1:00?

03:37.291 --> 03:38.625
Look, it boosts morale.

03:38.709 --> 03:41.041
Plus, I almost have enough tickets

03:38.709 --> 03:41.041
to get that belt buckle

03:41.125 --> 03:42.375
with the bottle opener in it.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.542
Listen, I'm not saying

03:42.458 --> 03:44.542
that you shouldn't go.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.542
I'm just saying, take me with you!

03:46.625 --> 03:48.625
Wait, let's make a whole big

03:46.625 --> 03:48.625
family thing out of it.

03:48.709 --> 03:51.125
We can go on Saturdays

03:48.709 --> 03:51.125
after ballet, before soccer!

03:51.208 --> 03:52.834
Twice a week seems like a lot.

03:52.917 --> 03:54.291
Okay, so skip Thursday.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.667
You can come home early

03:54.375 --> 03:56.667
and help me around the house.

03:56.750 --> 03:57.834
Oh, this'll be so fun.

03:57.917 --> 03:59.375
I'll play Steely Dan for you.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.333
-Listen, Heather...

03:59.458 --> 04:01.333
-Okay, let me just say,

04:01.542 --> 04:03.667
I think that we are just, like, so...

04:04.125 --> 04:05.667
-(grunts enthusiastically)

04:04.125 --> 04:05.667
-Yeah, I'm definitely...

04:05.750 --> 04:08.041
(grunts) We have been spending

04:05.750 --> 04:08.041
an awful lot of time together.

04:08.125 --> 04:11.041
Wait, I wrote a little picture

04:08.125 --> 04:11.041
here of you and me...

04:11.125 --> 04:12.834
(whispers) and everything

04:11.125 --> 04:12.834
that went down in room three.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.166
-Hmm? (giggles)

04:16.083 --> 04:18.166
-It's very graphic.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.125
Hello, gorgeous!

04:20.208 --> 04:22.667
Ah, ah, ah, ah, your wife

04:20.208 --> 04:22.667
told us about your cholesterol.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.333
Oh, I can't take it anymore!

04:24.959 --> 04:26.083
I love her, but I'll tell you something.

04:26.166 --> 04:29.542
Do you have any idea how frustrating it is

04:26.166 --> 04:29.542
to have your wife around all the time?

04:30.333 --> 04:31.166
I'm sorry.

04:31.959 --> 04:33.291
We all miss Jackie.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.208
I should have complimented her more.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.166
If I only had one more day...

04:37.542 --> 04:38.875
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

04:39.458 --> 04:41.458
I only have one more day

04:39.458 --> 04:41.458
till the temp shows up,

04:41.542 --> 04:43.709
and then I can go back

04:41.542 --> 04:43.709
to being the boss around here.

04:44.291 --> 04:45.458
That's not going to kill me.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.125
I'm sorry.

04:47.208 --> 04:50.000
I'm just really looking forward

04:47.208 --> 04:50.000
to a time when my wife is gone.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.208
I'm sorry.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.000
I... I'm really crashing

04:51.291 --> 04:54.000
and burning over here.

04:54.291 --> 04:55.333
I'm sorry!

04:55.959 --> 04:56.959
(sighs)

05:00.458 --> 05:03.542
Well, I am so mad

05:00.458 --> 05:03.542
that today is your last day.

05:03.625 --> 05:06.458
Oh, it's just so unfair.

05:06.959 --> 05:08.125
Do you really mean that?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.208
-Yeah, I'm going to miss you.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.208
-Aww...

05:11.291 --> 05:14.375
And especially those...

05:11.291 --> 05:14.375
super-healthy snacks

05:14.458 --> 05:16.208
you always bring-- Oh, here it comes!

05:16.291 --> 05:19.000
Oh, hummus, and carrots.

05:19.083 --> 05:21.542
Yeah, two great tastes

05:19.083 --> 05:21.542
that taste great together.

05:21.625 --> 05:22.834
Just like us.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.166
I have a surprise for you.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.041
You got me the belt buckle bottle opener?

05:26.125 --> 05:28.417
No, even better than that.

05:28.667 --> 05:29.875
I got you me!

05:30.834 --> 05:35.625
I switched carpool to morning

05:30.834 --> 05:35.625
so I can be here permanently.

05:36.834 --> 05:37.750
Wow.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.250
The kids are getting older,

05:40.333 --> 05:42.583
and they just don't need me

05:40.333 --> 05:42.583
like they used to.

05:42.959 --> 05:45.542
And then I come here,

05:42.959 --> 05:45.542
and you need me so much.

05:45.625 --> 05:46.750
-And I just...

05:45.625 --> 05:46.750
-Mm-hm.

05:47.709 --> 05:49.291
I can't believe I'm crying about it.

05:49.375 --> 05:50.208
I know.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.125
Oh, look, you are, too.

05:52.208 --> 05:53.458
It's a lot of feelings.

05:53.542 --> 05:56.875
I know, but I'm going to be here

05:53.542 --> 05:56.875
all day with you every day!

05:56.959 --> 05:58.458
(crying)

06:03.709 --> 06:05.083
Hey, hi, Joanie!

06:05.917 --> 06:07.625
Tim, what are you doing out here?

06:07.709 --> 06:09.041
It's the middle of the night.

06:09.125 --> 06:10.709
Oh, well, you know, it's...

06:10.792 --> 06:12.500
Now that we've got Clementine

06:10.792 --> 06:12.500
living with us,

06:12.583 --> 06:14.166
you know, I like to come

06:12.583 --> 06:14.166
out here to think.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.083
And to fart.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.125
Which one are you doing now?

06:18.208 --> 06:21.667
Neither, no, I... just locked myself

06:18.208 --> 06:21.667
out of the house about an hour ago.

06:21.750 --> 06:22.834
Oh, oh.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.083
What are you doing outside?

06:24.542 --> 06:26.208
Oh, I'm just trying to tire myself out.

06:26.291 --> 06:28.083
I haven't been able to sleep lately.

06:28.166 --> 06:30.500
(sighs) I had that problem once.

06:30.583 --> 06:31.917
-Yeah?

06:30.583 --> 06:31.917
-Yeah, apparently, you're not

06:32.000 --> 06:34.083
supposed to drink fruit punch

06:32.000 --> 06:34.083
after midnight.

06:34.667 --> 06:35.583
Or as an adult.

06:35.959 --> 06:38.291
I, I, I'm just so anxious and...

06:38.375 --> 06:41.667
The strange thing is,

06:38.375 --> 06:41.667
I don't have anything to be anxious about.

06:41.959 --> 06:43.667
That just makes me more anxious.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.041
We all go through that, you know?

06:45.125 --> 06:46.250
I'm sure it'll pass.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.333
In the meantime,

06:46.875 --> 06:48.333
I could prescribe something

06:48.417 --> 06:49.542
you may not have tried.

06:53.542 --> 06:55.125
Can I help you with anything

06:53.542 --> 06:55.125
in particular?

06:55.208 --> 06:56.583
(laughing) Oh, no.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.625
(mutters) I'm not actually a drug addict.

06:59.709 --> 07:02.750
Um, although I did pass a dutchie

06:59.709 --> 07:02.750
once in college,

07:03.041 --> 07:05.041
but it was to the right-hand side,

07:05.125 --> 07:07.667
and everybody got very quiet

07:05.125 --> 07:07.667
and then asked me to leave.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.500
Oh, well,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.500
perhaps we can get you an edible.

07:10.583 --> 07:11.458
An edible?

07:11.542 --> 07:13.709
It's where we bake the weed

07:11.542 --> 07:13.709
into the pastry

07:13.792 --> 07:14.709
so you don't have to smoke it.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.125
We bake it into all of our goods here.

07:16.208 --> 07:17.250
Ah!

07:17.583 --> 07:19.583
Oh, is there pot in the scones?

07:19.667 --> 07:21.583
Oh, no, no, no.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.583
You can go ahead, try them.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.667
-They're delicious.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.667
-Oh, thank you!

07:23.959 --> 07:25.417
Thank you so much!

07:25.500 --> 07:27.458
I baked them today, they're super-fresh.

07:28.834 --> 07:31.542
Whoa, slow down, slow down.

07:28.834 --> 07:31.542
That-that's pretty potent.

07:31.792 --> 07:34.750
(mouth full) You said there wasn't

07:31.792 --> 07:34.750
any pot in the scones.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.208
No, but there's a lot in the jam.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.542
The key to a strong joint

07:41.000 --> 07:43.542
is homemade rolling papers.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.458
You have so much knowledge.

07:45.542 --> 07:47.458
I feel like I'm with Alex Trebek.

07:48.959 --> 07:51.583
I want to know everything

07:48.959 --> 07:51.583
you know in all of life.

07:52.917 --> 07:55.166
With a glue gun and an old pog container,

07:55.250 --> 07:57.417
I repurposed this flower pot into a bong.

07:58.333 --> 07:59.166
Oh...

08:00.250 --> 08:03.041
That's so deeply artesianal!

08:03.125 --> 08:04.083
You see this bucket?

08:05.625 --> 08:06.458
Voilà!

08:06.875 --> 08:08.166
Impromptu bongo.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.583
(tribal music playing)

08:24.667 --> 08:25.875
(bongo taps)

08:26.166 --> 08:27.417
Holy Willie Nelson!

08:27.959 --> 08:29.208
What are you doing here, Joan?

08:29.291 --> 08:31.500
You cured my insomnia.

08:32.041 --> 08:34.375
And now, I sleep like the pharaohs.

08:35.667 --> 08:38.250
This is a bongo.

08:40.917 --> 08:42.500
But if you turn it upside-down...

08:45.375 --> 08:46.333
It's a bucket.

08:46.417 --> 08:48.500
(laughs slowly) Wow.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.208
Are you high right now?

08:52.083 --> 08:53.041
-Yes.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.041
-Oh.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.667
And right now.

08:54.750 --> 08:55.583
Oh, yeah.

08:56.834 --> 08:59.125
Sex is always complicated for me.

08:59.208 --> 09:00.291
Mm.

09:00.375 --> 09:03.583
Sometimes I think it's

09:00.375 --> 09:03.583
because I lost one of my balls in the war.

09:03.667 --> 09:04.542
Mm.

09:04.625 --> 09:07.458
I mean, they could've saved it,

09:04.625 --> 09:07.458
but it wasn't the good one, so...

09:08.667 --> 09:11.125
You know something that might help you?

09:11.625 --> 09:13.500
-What's that?

09:11.625 --> 09:13.500
-A fattie!

09:14.625 --> 09:17.041
Oh, I don't really know any portly gals.

09:17.417 --> 09:18.417
No, no, no, no.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.709
This is the kind of fattie

09:18.500 --> 09:21.709
that was popular in high school.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.750
And here is a blimp!

09:24.083 --> 09:25.458
(both laughs)

09:25.542 --> 09:29.709
Holy mackerel, I am as baked

09:25.542 --> 09:29.709
as a Brie on Easter.

09:30.041 --> 09:32.000
Me also as well.

09:32.083 --> 09:35.000
(laughing)

09:35.792 --> 09:37.041
Was that an earthquake?

09:37.417 --> 09:38.250
No.

09:38.667 --> 09:41.208
-Was that an earthquake?

09:38.667 --> 09:41.208
-No, I didn't feel anything.

09:41.709 --> 09:44.000
In fact, I don't feel anything at all,

09:44.083 --> 09:46.834
except a very strong desire

09:44.083 --> 09:46.834
to hug your husband

09:46.917 --> 09:48.166
while he washes the car.

09:48.250 --> 09:51.667
I'm certain there's an earthquake coming,

09:48.250 --> 09:51.667
and you know what?

09:52.333 --> 09:54.125
I don't know where the gas-off is.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.542
Okay, don't even worry--

09:54.208 --> 09:55.542
Look, you're having--

09:55.625 --> 09:58.959
-I didn't... where the gas-off is.

09:55.625 --> 09:58.959
-You're having a bad trip,

09:59.041 --> 10:01.041
so I want you to have a sip of water...

10:01.125 --> 10:01.959
-Okay.

10:01.125 --> 10:01.959
-...okay?

10:02.041 --> 10:03.291
-Okay.

10:02.041 --> 10:03.291
-And then just breathe.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.667
-And just, no more of this right now.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.667
-(gasps, exhales)

10:06.333 --> 10:08.333
That's it, good, gulpy-gulpy...

10:08.917 --> 10:11.083
-(moans)

10:08.917 --> 10:11.083
-There you go, there you go.

10:11.417 --> 10:12.333
Good, good.

10:12.834 --> 10:14.542
I've forgotten how to swallow.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.417
-Yeah.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.417
-I'm, I'm too high.

10:17.875 --> 10:18.917
I don't like this.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.166
(stammers) I want to go home.

10:21.583 --> 10:25.875
(wailing)

10:28.333 --> 10:31.291
I just don't think the chronic

10:28.333 --> 10:31.291
is the answer for me.

10:32.083 --> 10:32.917
Oh, okay.

10:33.792 --> 10:35.208
Well, I'll tell you what works for me.

10:35.291 --> 10:38.375
Um, you know, I like to go to bed full.

10:38.959 --> 10:41.083
So I'd get about three pounds

10:38.959 --> 10:41.083
of beef in you,

10:41.166 --> 10:42.834
and before you know it,

10:41.166 --> 10:42.834
you'll be counting sheep.

10:43.959 --> 10:46.417
The real trick is learning

10:43.959 --> 10:46.417
how to fight off the meat sweats.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.500
But that's where

10:46.500 --> 10:48.500
the sleeping pills come in.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.583
-Thank you.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.583
-Oh.

10:52.125 --> 10:53.625
-Here, this is for you.

10:52.125 --> 10:53.625
-Oh!

10:53.709 --> 10:56.291
Just go easy on the jam.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.542
Come on, I'm not that fat.

10:59.625 --> 11:00.959
(chuckling)

11:04.834 --> 11:06.542
(sighs) I'm so fat.

11:08.792 --> 11:09.625
Who said that?!

11:19.500 --> 11:20.917
You got carpal tunnel voting

11:21.000 --> 11:23.375
for every singing competition

11:21.000 --> 11:23.375
on television.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.375
You're not going to vote for president?

11:25.458 --> 11:26.917
Well, if I could text it I would.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.834
But I can't, because I have carpal tunnel.

11:33.625 --> 11:36.000
Hey, so our polling place is

11:33.625 --> 11:36.000
at your parents' neighbors' garage.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.667
I was thinking if we took the same car,

11:37.750 --> 11:39.375
then your dad couldn't charge us

11:37.750 --> 11:39.375
as much for parking.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.959
-I'm not voting.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.959
-Greg, come on.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.834
You, like, you got carpal tunnel voting

11:44.917 --> 11:47.375
for every singing competition

11:44.917 --> 11:47.375
on television.

11:47.458 --> 11:49.375
You're not going to vote for president?

11:49.458 --> 11:50.917
Well, if I could text it I would.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.834
But I can't, because I have carpal tunnel.

11:53.250 --> 11:57.083
I... I honestly, I still cannot believe

11:53.250 --> 11:57.083
that you have never voted in an election.

11:57.166 --> 11:58.458
I voted in an election!

11:58.542 --> 12:00.458
-Really?

11:58.542 --> 12:00.458
-Matt Malloy for student body president.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.625
Said he was going to make

12:00.542 --> 12:02.625
the hallways safe for nerds.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.291
-He didn't.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.291
-Yeah, still working through that one.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.792
Honestly, Greg, the people we elect

12:06.750 --> 12:09.792
are going to shape Lark's future.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.333
She's so disappointed

12:10.625 --> 12:12.333
that you're not voting,

12:12.417 --> 12:13.834
she can't even look at you.

12:16.417 --> 12:17.417
Lark, look at Daddy.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.041
GREG: Okay, Lark, this is for you!

12:25.458 --> 12:26.917
Ugh, that line...

12:29.041 --> 12:30.208
Eh... I'll come back later.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.208
Long line for coffee.

12:33.834 --> 12:34.792
Yeah, it's kind of my fault.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.417
I voted this place

12:34.875 --> 12:36.417
the number one coffee place

12:36.500 --> 12:37.917
-in town like 12 times.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.917
-(chuckles)

12:39.000 --> 12:40.417
I think you dropped your sticker.

12:41.125 --> 12:42.458
Oh, no, I don't, uh...

12:43.458 --> 12:45.834
Oh, gosh, yeah. It must have fallen off

12:45.917 --> 12:48.875
when I rescued that lost dog

12:45.917 --> 12:48.875
on the highway.

12:48.959 --> 12:50.250
Aw... (chuckles)

12:50.333 --> 12:51.208
Twinsies.

12:51.667 --> 12:52.542
Huh?

12:53.041 --> 12:54.750
-Boop.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.750
-BARISTA: Next.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.083
-Hi.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.291
Umm...

12:59.375 --> 13:00.667
nitro cold brew.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.959
I don't know what that is, is that cool?

13:02.041 --> 13:03.959
It must be,

13:02.041 --> 13:03.959
it's got the word "nitro" in it.

13:05.041 --> 13:06.625
Oh, you don't have to pay

13:05.041 --> 13:06.625
if you voted today.

13:07.542 --> 13:08.834
-Really?

13:07.542 --> 13:08.834
-Yeah.

13:08.917 --> 13:09.750
All right!

13:10.333 --> 13:13.709
Just going to tip, tipping and voting!

13:13.959 --> 13:14.875
That's what I do.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.208
Keep America strong and safe.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.375
Come on, everybody, "Hamilton!"

13:19.458 --> 13:20.834
ALL: Hamilton!

13:20.917 --> 13:22.166
-MAN: That's right.

13:20.917 --> 13:22.166
-GREG: Pull it in, patriots.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.875
Three, two, one.

13:24.959 --> 13:25.875
Hamilton!

13:25.959 --> 13:29.583
ALL: Hamilton!

13:29.667 --> 13:31.291
Oh wait, it was a video.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.125
-Hi, Pam.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.125
-Hi.

13:35.208 --> 13:36.625
-Hey, John.

13:35.208 --> 13:36.625
-Hey.

13:36.709 --> 13:37.750
Historic day, huh?

13:37.834 --> 13:39.291
-(chuckles)

13:37.834 --> 13:39.291
-Oh, did the girl win?

13:40.208 --> 13:43.500
Oh, I... No, I was just talking about

13:40.208 --> 13:43.500
how Greg actually voted.

13:43.583 --> 13:46.667
Oh, that must've been when I was

13:43.583 --> 13:46.667
allowed my one bathroom break.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.834
Better not have used my shell soaps.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.166
Jen, I don't see Greg on this voting log.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.208
And I keep a good log.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.417
If he didn't sign, he wasn't here.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.375
Say "voting"...

14:02.500 --> 14:07.333
Wow, another classic

14:02.500 --> 14:07.333
Election Day selfie, I see.

14:07.417 --> 14:08.291
You saw my Instagram?

14:08.375 --> 14:09.875
-I did.

14:08.375 --> 14:09.875
-Fourteen likes!

14:09.959 --> 14:12.333
I mean that's twice as many

14:09.959 --> 14:12.333
as the selfie I took

14:12.417 --> 14:14.125
with that dude who looked like Bono.

14:14.208 --> 14:15.917
Yeah, so you voted?

14:16.792 --> 14:18.709
Mm-hmm, I got the sticker, don't I?

14:19.667 --> 14:22.083
You got the sticker by going

14:19.667 --> 14:22.083
to the polling place

14:22.166 --> 14:24.667
and just, like, straight-up voting?

14:24.750 --> 14:26.667
I went to the polling place.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.834
-Okay. Right.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.834
-Next to my parents' house.

14:28.917 --> 14:32.542
And I... got my sticker.

14:32.834 --> 14:34.917
Greg, will you just look me in the eye

14:35.000 --> 14:36.750
and tell me that you voted?

14:40.750 --> 14:42.792
No, no, I said my eye, my eyes.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.542
Nope, nope.

14:45.834 --> 14:48.041
The eyebrows are a good marker,

14:45.834 --> 14:48.041
it's just right below them.

14:48.291 --> 14:49.333
We're almost there.

14:49.417 --> 14:50.792
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

14:51.917 --> 14:53.875
-I didn't vote, okay?

14:51.917 --> 14:53.875
-Right, yeah.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.000
But I got the sticker,

14:55.959 --> 14:58.000
and I felt like I was

14:55.959 --> 14:58.000
part of something larger,

14:58.083 --> 14:59.750
you know, and all the

14:58.083 --> 14:59.750
other stuff that you said.

14:59.834 --> 15:02.208
So... I just... put it on.

15:02.291 --> 15:03.709
But you didn't vote.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.208
No.

15:05.291 --> 15:06.458
So I'm going to have to take that sticker.

15:06.542 --> 15:09.583
No! No, no. (stammers) I need this.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.083
Greg, that's not your sticker.

15:11.166 --> 15:13.166
How dare you say that, Jen!

15:13.875 --> 15:16.125
Look... there is still time

15:13.875 --> 15:16.125
for me to earn this sticker.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.583
And that's exactly what

15:16.208 --> 15:18.583
I'm going to do, all right?

15:18.667 --> 15:20.083
I'm going to go down there,

15:18.667 --> 15:20.083
and I'm going to vote.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.667
-Okay.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.667
-'Cause I'm tired of lying about it.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.041
I want to know what

15:23.166 --> 15:25.041
it feels like for real!

15:26.041 --> 15:29.458
And this sounds exactly like

15:26.041 --> 15:29.458
when I lost my virginity.

15:31.750 --> 15:34.458
Are you going to call your mom

15:31.750 --> 15:34.458
afterwards this time, too?

15:35.166 --> 15:36.125
If you didn't do it,

15:36.208 --> 15:38.250
how did the shell lose its ridges?

15:38.333 --> 15:40.083
Would you rather I didn't wash my hands?

15:40.166 --> 15:42.750
I'd rather my shell have its ridges!

15:42.834 --> 15:44.917
It's like getting excited

15:42.834 --> 15:44.917
for a ruffle chip,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.291
when there's a no-ruffle chip.

15:46.375 --> 15:48.959
How are you supposed to dip

15:46.375 --> 15:48.959
a no-ruffle chip?

15:49.041 --> 15:52.125
(breathless) Hi. Greg Short.

15:49.041 --> 15:52.125
He knows who I am.

15:52.208 --> 15:53.625
Where did you get that sticker?

15:53.709 --> 15:55.959
Oh, uh... I found it on the ground.

15:56.333 --> 15:57.583
That is sticker fraud!

15:57.917 --> 15:59.333
You're admitting to sticker fraud!

15:59.417 --> 16:00.583
That's a federal offense!

16:00.667 --> 16:02.291
John, call 911.

16:02.375 --> 16:03.500
No, Dad, don't!

16:03.583 --> 16:04.834
Look, I-- I'm sorry.

16:04.917 --> 16:06.208
Ah... please, just, uh...

16:06.500 --> 16:08.000
Just let me vote, okay?

16:09.125 --> 16:10.291
I want this.

16:10.375 --> 16:11.750
I, I, I need this.

16:11.834 --> 16:14.417
I-- I will only be five seconds, I swear.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Wow, this is like I'm losing my virginity.

16:19.917 --> 16:22.208
All right, don't go all crazy

16:19.917 --> 16:22.208
with your John Hancock.

16:22.291 --> 16:24.250
My log is tight.

16:24.667 --> 16:27.333
Okay, let's do this.

16:28.125 --> 16:30.875
It's time to make a difference.

16:30.959 --> 16:33.583
Dad, what the hell is a comptroller?

16:33.875 --> 16:35.333
Oh, nobody knows.

16:36.917 --> 16:38.333
Don't get caught up in the minutiae.

16:38.417 --> 16:40.709
Voting is about feeling part of something,

16:40.792 --> 16:42.333
not knowing stuff.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.041
Okay.

16:46.917 --> 16:49.000
<i>♪ Yes, yes, yes, yes ♪</i>

16:49.083 --> 16:51.000
<i>♪ No, yes, no, yes ♪</i>

16:51.083 --> 16:52.875
<i>♪ No, yes, no, yes ♪</i>

16:52.959 --> 16:53.875
<i>♪ No, yes-- ♪</i>

16:54.333 --> 16:56.333
Oh, I need another one, I made a mistake.

17:01.792 --> 17:05.542
Uh, the Internet is pretty convinced

17:01.792 --> 17:05.542
that my fiancée has anaplasmosis,

17:05.625 --> 17:06.750
which, if that gets airborne,

17:06.834 --> 17:09.125
it's going to turn this whole damn town

17:06.834 --> 17:09.125
into the Talking Dead.

17:13.834 --> 17:15.667
-Baby, look what just came in the mail!

17:13.834 --> 17:15.667
-Hmm?

17:15.750 --> 17:17.917
<i>-♪ Our first bill as a couple ♪</i>

17:15.750 --> 17:17.917
-Aww.

17:18.542 --> 17:20.083
Ha, and to think,

17:18.542 --> 17:20.083
before we moved in together

17:20.166 --> 17:21.500
I used to just throw these in the trash.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.333
Aw... (giggles)

17:24.542 --> 17:25.375
(groans)

17:26.166 --> 17:28.750
-You okay?

17:26.166 --> 17:28.750
-Yeah, just a little...

17:28.834 --> 17:30.000
Hmm... okay.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.625
-Oh!

17:30.083 --> 17:31.625
-Whoa! That didn't seem little.

17:31.709 --> 17:33.208
You want to, like, call the doctor or...

17:33.291 --> 17:35.041
No, I am fine.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.000
Now where were we?

17:36.083 --> 17:37.875
-Being all sexy-time up here.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.875
-Mm-hmm.

17:38.834 --> 17:39.667
Oh!

17:40.750 --> 17:41.583
-(groans)

17:40.750 --> 17:41.583
-Oh.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.208
-Oh... (exhales)

17:42.750 --> 17:44.208
-Oh, no...

17:48.041 --> 17:49.250
Um, excuse me,

17:49.333 --> 17:51.417
is there any way that we could get in

17:49.333 --> 17:51.417
to see a doctor right away?

17:51.500 --> 17:55.333
Because the Internet is pretty convinced

17:51.500 --> 17:55.333
that my fiancée has anaplasmosis,

17:55.417 --> 17:56.542
which, if that gets airborne,

17:56.625 --> 17:59.083
it's going to turn this whole damn town

17:56.625 --> 17:59.083
into the Talking Dead.

18:00.959 --> 18:04.333
"Cramping, bloating,

18:00.959 --> 18:04.333
sharp abdominal pain."

18:04.417 --> 18:06.041
How long has this been going on?

18:06.125 --> 18:07.750
Ah... one week?

18:07.834 --> 18:09.291
This has been happening since we moved in?

18:10.792 --> 18:11.625
Aw...

18:12.166 --> 18:13.667
(quietly) We see this all the time.

18:13.750 --> 18:17.000
A couple moves in together and they try

18:13.750 --> 18:17.000
to keep some things a mystery.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.583
But there is no mystery about it.

18:19.667 --> 18:22.000
All women must poop.

18:23.834 --> 18:27.125
-I... I-I don't think that's what it is.

18:23.834 --> 18:27.125
-RECEPTIONIST: Ma'am?

18:27.208 --> 18:30.041
Have you made a bowel movement

18:27.208 --> 18:30.041
since you two started cohabitating?

18:30.125 --> 18:33.166
(laughing) Yes... like, that's crazy.

18:33.250 --> 18:36.125
Of course! Yes, tons!

18:37.000 --> 18:38.333
You're impacted, all right.

18:38.792 --> 18:40.250
That's disgusting.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.417
I'm glad I'm not you.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.250
We'll prescribe you something

18:41.500 --> 18:44.250
to get things moving again.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.250
Go home.

18:51.417 --> 18:53.834
Well, it's just that I love you.

18:53.917 --> 18:57.041
And I want you

18:53.917 --> 18:57.041
to be attracted to me forever.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.417
And that's why you haven't...

18:58.500 --> 18:59.709
Made a big job?

19:00.291 --> 19:01.125
Yup.

19:01.583 --> 19:02.917
I can't go when you're home.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.166
And you work from home.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.333
Just go at work.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.750
Ew! Nobody goes at work.

19:07.834 --> 19:09.041
You hear that, Brad?

19:11.083 --> 19:12.291
I can only go at home.

19:12.375 --> 19:15.166
And since we moved in together,

19:12.375 --> 19:15.166
I can't seem to go there, either.

19:15.750 --> 19:16.875
-Okay.

19:15.750 --> 19:16.875
-(sighs)

19:18.291 --> 19:19.667
You call it a big job?

19:20.750 --> 19:21.583
You don't?

19:22.333 --> 19:23.166
No...

19:29.375 --> 19:30.291
Good news!

19:30.375 --> 19:33.375
You don't have to worry about me

19:30.375 --> 19:33.375
running off with that cute pharmacist.

19:33.458 --> 19:35.291
He doesn't seem to be into me anymore.

19:37.208 --> 19:38.125
What the...?

19:46.500 --> 19:47.333
Babe?

19:48.542 --> 19:50.834
Wha-- Wha-What is all this?

19:53.291 --> 19:55.375
I asked you to marry me

19:53.291 --> 19:55.375
because I love you.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.834
You don't have to hide

19:57.000 --> 19:58.834
any part of yourself from me.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.959
What I'm saying is,

20:00.083 --> 20:02.959
I don't love you for what you don't do,

20:03.542 --> 20:05.500
I love you for what you do do.

20:07.125 --> 20:09.208
I worked on that last line

20:07.125 --> 20:09.208
for quite a while.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.667
Aww...

20:12.291 --> 20:13.542
You're going to need more candles.

20:13.625 --> 20:14.583
Shh.

20:15.291 --> 20:19.125
Just swallow that pill

20:15.291 --> 20:19.125
and know that no matter what happens,

20:19.208 --> 20:21.333
you're still going to be

20:19.208 --> 20:21.333
the sexiest woman I know.

20:21.917 --> 20:23.417
The pill doesn't go in my mouth.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.041
(strained) That's fine.

20:28.291 --> 20:29.125
All right.

20:30.792 --> 20:33.125
The biggest job in your life

20:30.792 --> 20:33.125
is waiting for you.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.959
Let's get in there and get to work!

20:36.500 --> 20:38.125
Oh. (chuckles)

20:38.750 --> 20:39.625
My hero.

20:43.625 --> 20:47.083
COLLEEN: But I think you're going too far

20:43.625 --> 20:47.083
to prove you're comfortable with me.

20:47.166 --> 20:49.208
-MATT: Yeah, maybe I'll just wait outside.

20:47.166 --> 20:49.208
-COLLEEN: Good idea.

20:52.959 --> 20:55.041
(closing theme playing)
