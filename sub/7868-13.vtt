00:47.600 --> 00:51.900
Oh, that stump is really
eating into my tractor budget.

00:53.701 --> 00:57.136
I'll have to use me explosives.

00:57.204 --> 00:59.739
Explosives? Great.

00:59.806 --> 01:01.807
<i>If we put charges on
the load-bearing walls,</i>

01:01.875 --> 01:03.142
<i>we can blow up detention hall</i>

01:03.210 --> 01:05.611
<i>while leaving the
art room unharmed.</i>

01:05.679 --> 01:07.013
- Hmm?
- Hey, I like art, okay?

01:07.080 --> 01:09.782
I'm blowing up the stump,
not the school.

01:09.850 --> 01:11.751
Right, right.

01:11.818 --> 01:13.319
You never saw that.

01:24.531 --> 01:25.765
Well done, boy.

01:25.832 --> 01:27.033
Wait, here comes the "mykeeyah".

01:27.100 --> 01:28.467
What's a mykeeyah?

01:29.669 --> 01:32.004
My Kia!

01:34.474 --> 01:36.942
I'm laughing to fit in,
but I still don't get it.

01:38.645 --> 01:40.546
Miss Hoover,
what's our lesson today?

01:40.614 --> 01:42.415
Is it school?

01:45.886 --> 01:47.987
Oh, I don't know. Let's see.

01:49.189 --> 01:51.457
Family trees.

01:51.525 --> 01:54.393
Who here knows what
a family tree is?

01:54.461 --> 01:55.928
Oh, family trees....

01:55.996 --> 01:58.597
the charts representing
genealogical relationships

01:58.665 --> 02:00.566
in a branching structure.

02:00.634 --> 02:01.967
Very good, Lisa.

02:02.035 --> 02:03.736
Class, your assignment
over the weekend will be

02:03.804 --> 02:05.671
to make your own family tree,

02:05.739 --> 02:09.108
emphasizing any notable or
distinguished ancestors.

02:09.175 --> 02:11.644
I can't wait to see
what noble branches lie

02:11.711 --> 02:14.213
in the Simpson family foliage.

02:15.315 --> 02:18.651
<i>No, this can't be right.</i>

02:18.718 --> 02:21.220
Yech, they're all horrible.

02:21.288 --> 02:24.690
Yeah, the Simpson family is a
long line of horse thieves,

02:24.758 --> 02:28.561
deadbeats, horse beats,
dead thieves, and even a few...

02:28.628 --> 02:30.896
...alcoholics.

02:30.964 --> 02:32.898
There must have been
some good ancestors.

02:32.966 --> 02:34.667
Grampa,

02:34.734 --> 02:36.268
- don't you know any? 
- Not a one.

02:36.336 --> 02:38.971
Maybe the nicest was
Abigail Simpson,

02:39.039 --> 02:41.574
who you know as the
Pittsburgh Poisoner.

02:41.641 --> 02:42.875
Listen, Lisa, you're going to find

02:42.943 --> 02:44.343
more than you bargained for.

02:44.411 --> 02:47.012
If I were you,
I wouldn't dig into the past.

02:47.080 --> 02:50.816
I lived in some of that past,
and I got out for a reason.

02:50.884 --> 02:52.952
I won't give up.
I have to know that somewhere

02:53.019 --> 02:55.488
in the muck and the mire and
the Pittsburgh Poisoners,

02:55.555 --> 02:57.223
this family had a noble spark,

02:57.290 --> 03:00.493
and I will find it, even if I
have to go back to Adam and Eve.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.827
<i>Oh, you mean</i>

03:01.895 --> 03:03.262
Adam and Eve Simpson,

03:03.330 --> 03:06.966
or as you may know them,
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

03:10.604 --> 03:12.638
Ooh! Whoa!

03:16.076 --> 03:18.844
Well, are you going
to help me or what?

03:33.593 --> 03:34.894
Thank you.

03:34.961 --> 03:37.096
So, what are you looking for?

03:37.164 --> 03:39.832
Family records for a school
project on genealogical...

03:39.900 --> 03:41.901
Hey, that's great.

03:55.482 --> 03:57.983
<i>Hey, Dad's idea pad.</i>

03:58.051 --> 04:00.719
<i>Bicentennial issue of
Reader's Digest.</i>

04:00.787 --> 04:02.955
<i>Old ad for Buzz Cola.</i>

04:05.325 --> 04:07.660
<i>So dusty.</i>

04:13.133 --> 04:16.302
<i>The "Diary of Eliza Simpson"?</i>

04:16.369 --> 04:19.370
This entry is dated April 14, 1860.

04:19.439 --> 04:21.406
I warn you: I don't
know what's in there,

04:21.474 --> 04:24.610
but if it's about a Simpson,
you ain't gonna be proud.

04:24.678 --> 04:27.913
Our ancestors were
kicked out of Australia.

04:27.981 --> 04:29.315
Oh, stop.

04:29.382 --> 04:31.450
It's the journal of
a sweet little girl.

04:31.518 --> 04:32.518
Keep reading, honey.

04:32.586 --> 04:33.886
"Dearest diary,

04:33.954 --> 04:36.088
today I am the happiest
girl in Springfield..."

04:36.156 --> 04:37.923
See, all good.

04:37.991 --> 04:40.859
"...because tomorrow I shall
get my very first slave."

04:43.013 --> 04:46.013
I can't believe we're
descended from slave owners.

04:46.081 --> 04:47.581
Me neither.

04:47.649 --> 04:49.483
For once, the Simpsons
were in management.

04:49.551 --> 04:50.718
Homer.

04:50.785 --> 04:54.088
Oh, read a little more, honey.

04:54.155 --> 04:57.057
"Saturday, April 14, 1860.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.926
<i>Dear Diary, I must be brief,</i>

04:58.993 --> 05:00.794
<i>for tonight is the grand ball</i>

05:00.862 --> 05:02.963
<i>at Colonel Burns's plantation."</i>

05:03.031 --> 05:04.998
I shall dress myself in finery,

05:05.066 --> 05:06.867
like a well-to-do Southern belle.

05:06.935 --> 05:08.202
What's for dinner?

05:08.269 --> 05:11.705
- Possum.
- Oh, can't we have opossum?

05:11.773 --> 05:13.240
Not on your salary.

05:13.308 --> 05:16.944
I can't believe I buttoned
my britches for this.

05:17.011 --> 05:19.747
In my elegant gown,
no one will suspect

05:19.814 --> 05:21.749
that I'm actually
on a mission to help

05:21.816 --> 05:24.151
my very first slave
escape to freedom.

05:24.219 --> 05:26.787
Yes! She wasn't a slave owner.

05:26.855 --> 05:30.023
Our family was on the
Underground Railroad.

05:30.091 --> 05:32.493
We ran a subway station?

05:32.560 --> 05:34.094
No, the Underground Railroad

05:34.162 --> 05:36.597
was a bunch of people who
helped slaves escape to Canada.

05:36.664 --> 05:39.099
There were no actual trains
and it wasn't under ground.

05:39.167 --> 05:41.835
Then they should've called it
the Aboveground Normal-Road.

05:41.903 --> 05:43.504
- Good point, Bart.
- Absolutely.

05:43.571 --> 05:45.005
- Hadn't thought of that before.
- Very good, Bart.

05:45.073 --> 05:46.874
That's a great story, Lisa!

05:46.941 --> 05:49.410
And you should stop
reading right there.

05:50.879 --> 05:52.079
Wh... What are you doing?

05:52.147 --> 05:53.680
I want to know what happens next.

05:53.748 --> 05:54.982
Well, I don't.

05:55.049 --> 05:56.817
The motto of the Simpsons is:

05:56.885 --> 05:58.285
"Quit while you're ahead."

05:58.353 --> 05:59.753
I made it into a sampler.

06:01.723 --> 06:03.590
It's like when your
father and I left

06:03.658 --> 06:06.560
the movie Carrie right after she
was crowned prom queen.

06:06.628 --> 06:08.595
She was so happy.

06:08.663 --> 06:11.131
She had a lot of problems,
but they were all behind her.

06:11.199 --> 06:12.466
But, but, but... but... but...

06:12.534 --> 06:13.934
Time for bed, sweetie.

06:16.237 --> 06:19.973
<i>Lisa. Lisa, it's me.</i>

06:20.041 --> 06:22.142
<i>Eliza, the one good Simpson.</i>

06:22.210 --> 06:24.745
<i>I've got so much more to tell you.</i>

06:28.716 --> 06:30.884
I must know.

06:42.764 --> 06:45.532
You still reading that thing?

06:45.600 --> 06:48.535
I'm warning you: when
something goes into that vent,

06:48.603 --> 06:50.137
it shouldn't come out...

06:50.205 --> 06:52.105
<i>ever.</i>

06:52.173 --> 06:54.107
Well, I am reading it,
and when I'm finished,

06:54.175 --> 06:56.043
I'm going to use Eliza's diary

06:56.110 --> 06:58.111
for my "Black History
Month" presentation.

06:58.179 --> 06:59.646
Ooh, good idea.

06:59.714 --> 07:01.949
Bart, what are you doing
for Black History Month?

07:02.016 --> 07:04.585
I got an idea:
you can march to Selma,

07:04.652 --> 07:05.786
and tell her she's ugly!

07:09.958 --> 07:12.192
Listen. "April 20, 1860.

07:12.260 --> 07:15.195
A week ago, I had no idea
what the future would bring,

07:15.263 --> 07:17.798
which, I guess, is always
true of everyone all the time.

07:17.866 --> 07:19.566
Anyway, last Saturday night,

07:19.634 --> 07:21.068
<i>I went to Colonel Burns's ball."</i>

07:32.113 --> 07:35.015
I don't like this new Viennese
dance craze, "the waltz".

07:35.083 --> 07:36.683
One, two, three, one, two, three...

07:36.751 --> 07:39.653
Where's the "four"?
All music needs a four!

07:39.721 --> 07:42.556
I'll have the orchestra adjust
its time signature, sir.

07:42.624 --> 07:44.291
See that you do.

07:55.870 --> 07:57.838
<i>In the confusion,
I slipped out of the ball</i>

07:57.906 --> 07:59.439
<i>and made my way to the stables,</i>

07:59.507 --> 08:03.610
<i>where I was to meet Mr.
Burns's slave, Virgil.</i>

08:03.678 --> 08:07.681
<i>But when I got to the stables,
he was nowhere to be seen.</i>

08:07.749 --> 08:10.050
Virgil?

08:10.118 --> 08:11.051
Virgil, let's go.

08:17.625 --> 08:19.626
You look like you could
use a little help.

08:19.694 --> 08:21.795
Actually, I'm here to help you.

08:21.863 --> 08:24.565
- Follow me north to freedom.
- I don't think so.

08:24.632 --> 08:26.600
Why? Because I'm young
and I'm a woman?

08:26.668 --> 08:28.168
No, because you're pointing south.

08:29.804 --> 08:31.838
Oh, right, right. Sorry.

08:31.906 --> 08:33.607
It's my first time.

08:33.674 --> 08:36.176
That's all right. It's my 14th.

08:36.244 --> 08:38.211
<i>As we made our way northward,</i>

08:38.279 --> 08:40.113
<i>a couple of patrollers spotted us.</i>

08:40.181 --> 08:42.282
Well, well, well.

08:42.350 --> 08:44.318
Where do you think you're going?

08:44.385 --> 08:45.652
Run!

08:45.720 --> 08:47.321
- After them!
- Obviously.

08:47.388 --> 08:49.356
Well, you didn't say it.

08:51.159 --> 08:52.993
<i>Hearts pounding,
we fled into the woods,</i>

08:53.061 --> 08:54.595
<i>but their horses were fast.</i>

09:10.712 --> 09:12.346
<i>Escape seemed impossible.</i>

09:15.350 --> 09:17.050
<i>What happened next?</i>

09:17.118 --> 09:19.853
Uh, bu... That's all there is.

09:19.921 --> 09:21.922
The rest of the diary
has turned to dust.

09:25.927 --> 09:29.763
Oh! I'll never know if Eliza
got Virgil safely to freedom.

09:29.831 --> 09:31.598
Cheer up, sweetie.

09:31.666 --> 09:34.101
Maybe we can find the
answer in the library.

09:34.168 --> 09:35.836
To the reference desk!

09:37.205 --> 09:38.939
The library?

09:39.007 --> 09:41.441
Bart, can you believe we're
married to those nerds?

09:43.344 --> 09:44.745
<i>There are no books</i>

09:44.812 --> 09:47.848
about an Eliza Simpson,
but I did find this.

09:47.915 --> 09:49.249
<i>Ooh, a cookbook.</i>

09:50.518 --> 09:52.786
That's Eliza's mother!

09:52.854 --> 09:54.755
Martha, you are the best!

09:57.091 --> 09:59.459
<i>"Pork Butt in Cream",
"Snout-Fried Neck",</i>

09:59.527 --> 10:02.095
<i>"Frog-Haunch", "Hooves Au Jus",</i>

10:02.163 --> 10:03.897
<i>"Possum Pouch Pie"...</i>

10:03.965 --> 10:06.400
Please don't make those recipes.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.201
This one doesn't sound roadkill-y.

10:08.269 --> 10:10.003
And it comes with a story.

10:10.071 --> 10:12.839
"Many years ago,
my daughter, Eliza,

10:12.907 --> 10:16.243
brought a runaway slave,
Virgil, to the house."

10:16.310 --> 10:19.246
They made it back
to the house?! How?

10:19.313 --> 10:23.917
<i>The patrollers were too fast
for Eliza and Virgil.</i>

10:28.756 --> 10:32.926
<i>Luckily, they chanced upon a
traveling circus...</i>

10:35.630 --> 10:39.099
<i>...where they were helped by a crusty,
old clown.</i>

10:39.167 --> 10:42.335
A little schmutz,
a little schmear, and presto!

10:42.403 --> 10:44.838
You're part of the
under-clown railroad.

10:44.906 --> 10:46.907
So, you got any talent?

10:46.974 --> 10:49.209
Well, I am a bit musical.

10:49.277 --> 10:52.913
* The sun shines bright *

10:52.980 --> 10:57.284
* On my old Kentucky home. *

10:57.351 --> 11:00.220
Rule number one:
never be better than me.

11:00.288 --> 11:01.688
And I'm pretty bad.

11:07.361 --> 11:09.062
Nothing to see here...

11:09.130 --> 11:11.932
just a couple of clowns,
and the world's youngest bearded lady.

11:11.999 --> 11:13.834
That I is.

11:16.471 --> 11:19.873
Look at her any longer,
you're gonna have to pay a nickel.

11:19.941 --> 11:21.975
Why do I always ask for a nickel?

11:22.043 --> 11:24.311
That's like 20 bucks in 2010 money.

11:25.913 --> 11:28.615
Wait! All that was in the recipe?

11:28.683 --> 11:31.284
It was a footnote. See?

11:31.352 --> 11:35.021
"Anyway, I was very proud of Eliza,
but my husband Hiram

11:35.089 --> 11:36.890
had not quite caught
abolition fever."

11:36.958 --> 11:39.059
Uh-uh, no way.

11:39.127 --> 11:40.961
He'll get me in trouble.

11:41.028 --> 11:43.230
Maybe you'll change
your mind about me

11:43.297 --> 11:45.932
after you try some
of my wheel cakes.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.367
Wheel cakes?

11:47.435 --> 11:49.870
They're just
honey-sweetened batter...

11:49.937 --> 11:51.004
Go on.

11:51.072 --> 11:52.739
...deep-fried in hog lard.

11:52.807 --> 11:54.274
Lard, you say.

11:54.342 --> 11:56.877
Then dusted with powdered sugar.

11:56.944 --> 11:58.845
You can stay.

11:58.913 --> 12:00.313
You swear you'll help him?

12:02.250 --> 12:04.918
I give you my word as
a Southern gentleman.

12:04.986 --> 12:06.419
Whoo!

12:07.822 --> 12:10.624
So they did the right thing.

12:10.691 --> 12:12.225
My quest is fulfilled.

12:12.293 --> 12:14.761
Our family has heroes!

12:14.829 --> 12:15.996
Shh.

12:16.063 --> 12:17.664
Our family has heroes.

12:23.393 --> 12:26.161
Martin Luther King had a dream.

12:26.229 --> 12:28.096
Dreams are where Elmo
and Toy Story

12:28.164 --> 12:30.265
had a party and I went there.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.501
Yay. My turn is over.

12:32.569 --> 12:34.002
One of your best, Ralph.

12:34.070 --> 12:36.138
Next up, we have Simpson, L.

12:36.206 --> 12:39.174
My Black History Month
presentation is called

12:39.242 --> 12:41.910
"The Simpsons:
The First Family of Freedom."

12:43.179 --> 12:45.180
No, no, no, not now! Quit, quit!

12:45.248 --> 12:48.217
No, don't quit the program,
just the update, you stupid...

12:50.486 --> 12:52.387
Computers, right?

12:52.455 --> 12:55.357
Our story begins with a
spunky little spitfire

12:55.425 --> 12:57.359
named Eliza Simpson.

12:57.427 --> 12:59.995
The year was 1860,
and the Underground Railroad was...

13:01.865 --> 13:03.298
...though Hiram, Mabel, and Eliza

13:03.366 --> 13:06.201
are no longer among us,
their truth goes marching on.

13:06.269 --> 13:07.903
Thank you.

13:14.177 --> 13:16.178
Bravo, Lisa.

13:16.246 --> 13:21.917
Very entertaining, but then again,
fairy tales always are.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.020
What are you talking about?

13:25.088 --> 13:28.290
I hold in my hand another diary.

13:28.358 --> 13:31.260
That of my great-great-great...

13:32.996 --> 13:36.732
...great-great grandfafa,
Milford van Houten.

13:38.167 --> 13:40.769
"April 22nd, 1860...

13:40.837 --> 13:44.373
<i>I was reclining beneath a
sarsaparilla tree,</i>

13:44.440 --> 13:46.108
<i>reading about one</i>

13:46.175 --> 13:49.211
<i>of Mr. Thomas Jefferson's
marvelous inventions.</i>

13:49.279 --> 13:52.114
<i>when suddenly I heard
quite a commotion</i>

13:52.181 --> 13:53.415
<i>coming from the Simpson residence."</i>

13:53.483 --> 13:54.616
<i>You're lying!</i>

13:54.684 --> 13:56.985
<i>Leave me alone!
I have sells to crop.</i>

13:57.053 --> 14:00.222
That's one of Virgil's
sugar-sprinkled cake rings.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.424
Now, where is he?

14:02.492 --> 14:05.327
I don't have to answer
to some weak old man

14:05.395 --> 14:06.862
with a walking stick.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.163
Ahh! A beating stick!

14:08.231 --> 14:09.197
Brigand.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.899
Dastard.

14:10.967 --> 14:12.134
Renegade.

14:12.201 --> 14:13.602
Mooncalf.

14:13.670 --> 14:16.939
I can't tell you where he is...
I swore an oath.

14:17.006 --> 14:19.207
I see.

14:19.275 --> 14:23.278
You know, Simpson,
every man has his price.

14:23.346 --> 14:26.915
No one is better at determining
said price than yours truly.

14:36.025 --> 14:38.260
I would say your price is...

14:38.328 --> 14:40.462
a pleasant surprise.

14:40.530 --> 14:42.798
That's exactly my price.

14:42.865 --> 14:44.199
Your man Virgil is...

14:44.267 --> 14:45.367
in...

14:45.435 --> 14:46.368
Father, no!

14:46.436 --> 14:48.103
Eliza, hold your tongue!

14:48.171 --> 14:50.372
Don't worry, I'll handle this one.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.208
Young lady, in this day and age,

14:53.276 --> 14:55.544
women only express their
opinions in diaries

14:55.611 --> 14:57.913
to be found long
after they're gone.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.048
From the day you were born,
you were brought up

15:00.116 --> 15:02.617
to crave the approval of a man.

15:02.685 --> 15:05.220
And I know you really
want to be a good girl,

15:05.288 --> 15:08.357
and good girls are
seen and not heard.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.462
Yes, sir.

15:13.529 --> 15:14.796
That-a-girl.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.866
Now, where's my man?

15:17.934 --> 15:18.834
In the turnip shed.

15:18.901 --> 15:20.102
Now, what's my surprise?

15:20.169 --> 15:22.938
Your surprise is a
new pair of shoes.

15:23.006 --> 15:26.241
Oh, my God, that
surprise is so pleasant.

15:30.246 --> 15:32.247
<i>"After that fateful day,</i>

15:32.315 --> 15:37.052
I could never even
look at Eliza again."

15:37.120 --> 15:38.553
It didn't help that the next day,

15:38.621 --> 15:40.589
he drank bad well
water and went blind.

15:40.656 --> 15:41.990
No! You lie!

15:42.058 --> 15:45.060
Eliza Simpson can't be a coward.

15:45.128 --> 15:47.396
She's the only decent
ancestor I have.

15:47.463 --> 15:50.132
Ach. Take it outside, lassie.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.234
We've still got three
"Jackie Robinsons"

15:52.301 --> 15:54.903
and a "Tuskegee Airmen" to go.

15:54.971 --> 15:56.638
And so many Obamas.

15:56.706 --> 15:57.873
Yes, we can.

15:57.940 --> 15:59.875
- Audacity of hope.
- Let me be clear.

16:02.716 --> 16:05.017
As I told you,
we don't have any books

16:05.085 --> 16:07.153
pertaining to Eliza Simpson.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.221
But I need to prove
that my ancestor

16:09.289 --> 16:11.223
couldn't have backed
down to Colonel Burns.

16:11.291 --> 16:12.758
Colonel Burns?

16:12.826 --> 16:14.960
Why, I haven't heard my
father's name in years.

16:17.297 --> 16:19.899
You know, you could
try our film vault.

16:19.966 --> 16:21.000
Huh?

16:21.068 --> 16:23.002
We have a film vault?

16:23.070 --> 16:25.204
It's where we hooked up
during the Christmas party.

16:25.272 --> 16:26.672
Oh.

16:31.344 --> 16:32.411
<i>So, Miss Eliza, I understand</i>

16:32.479 --> 16:34.547
<i>you just turned 100.</i>

16:34.614 --> 16:37.149
It's been quite a life.

16:37.217 --> 16:38.384
<i>Any regrets?</i>

16:38.452 --> 16:39.952
Just one.

16:40.020 --> 16:42.822
When I was a girl,
I witnessed a grave injustice,

16:42.889 --> 16:44.390
but I held my tongue.

16:44.458 --> 16:47.226
That pat on my head
from a wicked man

16:47.294 --> 16:49.328
has haunted me to this day.

16:54.067 --> 16:57.036
There's no noble Simpson.

16:57.104 --> 17:00.272
Oh, you were right, Dad.

17:00.340 --> 17:02.274
I should have quit
while I was ahead

17:02.342 --> 17:03.843
instead of learning
the horrible truth

17:03.910 --> 17:05.176
about our family and Virgil.

17:07.914 --> 17:10.316
Aw, don't cry, meat pie.

17:10.383 --> 17:12.952
Things worked out pretty
well for Virgil in the end.

17:13.019 --> 17:14.553
What are you talking about?

17:14.621 --> 17:16.122
Is there something
you know about Virgil

17:16.189 --> 17:17.556
that you haven't told us?

17:17.624 --> 17:19.892
I'll take that secret to my grave...

17:19.960 --> 17:22.595
or urn, or medical
school dissecting table,

17:22.662 --> 17:23.695
or wherever you're dumping me.

17:23.763 --> 17:25.765
Listen, Wrinkles,

17:25.832 --> 17:27.199
if you know something that'll
cheer up my little girl,

17:27.267 --> 17:28.834
you'd better spill it.

17:28.902 --> 17:32.438
Or I can make things very
uncomfortable for you.

17:32.506 --> 17:34.440
<i>That enough?</i>

17:34.508 --> 17:36.976
Ah! Okay, I'll talk.

17:37.043 --> 17:40.012
D-Day is June 6th.
Repeat, June 6th.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.882
Allied forces will land
on the beaches of Normandy

17:42.949 --> 17:45.818
in the following order: Utah,
Omaha, Gold, Juno.

17:45.886 --> 17:47.253
Are you writing this down, Fritz?

17:47.320 --> 17:48.554
About Virgil.

17:48.622 --> 17:49.822
Oh, right.

17:49.890 --> 17:52.591
Well, Lisa, Mabel
knew her husband well,

17:52.659 --> 17:56.262
<i>so she had cooked
up a little payback pie.</i>

17:58.565 --> 18:00.833
Get off my property, Colonel Burns.

18:00.901 --> 18:03.035
And if I ever see you
in these parts again...

18:04.371 --> 18:05.871
...you're gonna be a Memphis belle.

18:07.240 --> 18:10.609
Very well. You may
have won this round,

18:10.677 --> 18:13.012
but someday my history will be told

18:13.079 --> 18:15.347
by my descendants
Ken and Ric Burns.

18:17.717 --> 18:19.785
I knew you'd break your promise.

18:19.853 --> 18:21.720
Now I'm taking Virgil to freedom.

18:21.788 --> 18:24.523
You defied your husband for me?

18:24.591 --> 18:26.492
Man, this is the '60s.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.294
Now let's take you to a place

18:28.361 --> 18:31.330
where a black man can
blend in: Canada.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.700
<i>So, with those words,</i>

18:34.768 --> 18:37.136
<i>Mabel and Virgil headed north,</i>

18:37.204 --> 18:39.705
<i>but their journey was
fraught with peril.</i>

18:42.175 --> 18:43.375
Hmm...

18:46.613 --> 18:50.082
Mabel, why don't I go on alone,
and you go back to Hiram?

18:50.150 --> 18:51.150
No.

18:51.218 --> 18:52.952
There's no life for me with him.

18:53.019 --> 18:54.453
I just need to disguise my hair.

18:54.521 --> 18:55.487
But how?

18:55.555 --> 18:57.590
May I be of assistance?

18:57.657 --> 19:00.092
Abraham Lincoln?!

19:00.160 --> 19:02.795
Perhaps this hat will
help disguise your hair.

19:02.863 --> 19:04.263
Thank you.

19:06.166 --> 19:07.900
How's it look?

19:07.968 --> 19:10.069
It makes you look like
a potbellied stove.

19:10.136 --> 19:12.071
Hey, hey, "Honest Abe".

19:12.138 --> 19:14.540
Oh, I'm a riot.

19:14.608 --> 19:17.676
<i>As the border drew close,
so did Virgil and Mabel.</i>

19:17.744 --> 19:19.478
After you.

19:19.546 --> 19:23.382
<i>By the time they crossed into Canada,
things had changed.</i>

19:27.854 --> 19:29.788
<i>Mabel she divorced Hiram</i>

19:29.856 --> 19:31.724
<i>and got one of his shoes
in the settlement.</i>

19:35.328 --> 19:39.698
<i>Mabel and Virgil lived out the
rest of their days in peace.</i>

19:39.766 --> 19:42.635
<i>They got married, and since
Virgil had no last name,</i>

19:42.702 --> 19:44.536
<i>they both took the name Simpson</i>

19:44.604 --> 19:46.038
<i>so that Mabel could keep</i>

19:46.106 --> 19:48.707
<i>all her monogrammed table linens.</i>

19:48.775 --> 19:52.177
<i>And their son, Abraham Simpson,</i>

19:52.245 --> 19:54.380
<i>was my great-grandfather.</i>

19:58.518 --> 20:02.488
So you're actually descended
from Virgil, not Hiram.

20:02.555 --> 20:04.023
Are ya happy?

20:04.090 --> 20:05.791
Yes. I'm thrilled.

20:05.859 --> 20:08.193
We've regained our family honor,

20:08.261 --> 20:10.729
and we're 1/64th black.

20:10.797 --> 20:13.198
So that's why I'm so cool.

20:13.266 --> 20:15.434
That's why my jazz is so smooth.

20:15.502 --> 20:18.437
And that's why I earn less
than my white co-workers.

20:18.505 --> 20:19.939
Grampa, why'd you try to

20:20.006 --> 20:21.740
keep us from finding this out?

20:21.808 --> 20:24.710
Well, it's hard to explain
this to a young person,

20:24.778 --> 20:28.647
but people of my
generation are, you know...

20:28.715 --> 20:30.482
- Racists?
- That's it.

20:30.550 --> 20:32.651
I don't know what the big deal is.

20:32.719 --> 20:35.821
I mean, it never bothered any
of you that my father's French.

20:35.889 --> 20:37.723
You know, Bouvier?

20:37.791 --> 20:40.326
So that's why I love
drinking so much.

20:40.393 --> 20:42.194
I'm French, not you.

20:42.262 --> 20:44.463
<i>C'est la vie</i>, baby.
