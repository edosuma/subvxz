- Sacrifice my boy
for another?

00:10.552 --> 00:12.178
And now Tony's in a coma.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.347
Stay the hell away
from my son.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.770
* Stuck in the past *

00:20.812 --> 00:24.524
- Gabrielle, I picked up
something for you.

00:24.566 --> 00:28.236
- * Searching for something *

00:28.278 --> 00:30.030
- Are you listening?

00:30.071 --> 00:34.367
I brought you a new book.
You're gonna love this one.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.880
- You don't get it?

00:46.921 --> 00:49.883
It's the first snow.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.302
I have to call my dad.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.929
I need to remind him
to put on his snow tires.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.390
He forgot last year,
and he got into a car accident.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.225
- No matter
how many times you ask,

00:59.267 --> 01:02.020
the answer will always be no.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.438
- He needs me.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.732
- He was never there
when you needed him.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.860
- That's not true.
I'm his daughter.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.487
He loves me.

01:10.528 --> 01:14.115
- If that were true,
wouldn't he be looking for you?

01:15.992 --> 01:18.370
I've bookmarked several pages.

Not calling your father
is for your benefit, not mine.

Tony's dad will be here soon.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.310
You gotta go.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.772
- How's he doing?

01:45.814 --> 01:48.274
- Prognosis hasn't changed
since the gunshot,

01:48.316 --> 01:49.609
but you staying here
every night

01:49.651 --> 01:51.945

Bless you.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.336
- Is she still with Tony?

02:08.378 --> 02:10.046
- She's not gonna stop
feeling responsible

02:10.088 --> 02:13.466
until he comes out of his coma,
or we catch that bastard

02:13.508 --> 02:15.218
behind the trafficking ring.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.429
- How are you doing?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.806
- Um, you know, things
have been a little rough

02:19.848 --> 02:23.893
since the false lead on Jamie,
but I'm trying.

02:23.935 --> 02:27.188
[phone rumbles]

I know it's early.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.284
Your receptionist said
we could wait.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.785
- What can we do
for you, mister--

02:40.827 --> 02:42.495
- Call me Lucas, please.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.956
My Aunt Rachel
insisted on coming here.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.334
I thought she could handle it,
but clearly it's too much.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.170
- Stop.
Just stop it.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.841
I came here to talk
to Gabi Mosely.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.844
- I'm Gabi Mosley.
What can I do for you, Rachel?

02:57.886 --> 02:59.429
- I'm dying,

02:59.471 --> 03:03.808
and I need you to find my son.

[dramatic music]

03:12.275 --> 03:14.652
- When was the last time
you saw David?

03:14.694 --> 03:18.406
- Three months ago,
but we talk every day.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.492
- Why do you think
he's missing then?

03:20.533 --> 03:22.994
- Two days ago, he stopped
answering my phone calls.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.538
- Has he ever ignored
your calls before?

03:25.580 --> 03:29.334
- Every now and then.
He gets busy, you know?

03:29.376 --> 03:31.628
- Is there something different
this time?

03:31.670 --> 03:33.213
- Yes, he was finally
doing well.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.799
I mean, he'd got his life
back on track.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.967
- Meaning he's had problems
in the past?

03:38.009 --> 03:41.554
[soft dramatic music]

03:41.596 --> 03:44.641
- Have you gone
to David's house?

03:46.267 --> 03:48.770
- I don't know
where he's been living.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.398
- He was staying
with me and Rachel.

03:51.439 --> 03:54.526
That was up until
three months ago.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.445
- Did you contact the cops?

03:57.487 --> 04:03.243
- Well, we'd prefer
that they weren't involved.

04:03.284 --> 04:06.663
* *

04:06.705 --> 04:09.541
Look, I swear he's a good boy.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.043
He's just had some
emotional setbacks

04:12.085 --> 04:14.212
ever since his sister died.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.674
Elisa and him were very close.

04:17.716 --> 04:22.220
And now that I've stopped
responding to the chemo,

04:22.262 --> 04:24.514
he knows
he's gonna lose me too.

04:24.556 --> 04:29.269
And I don't know
how much time I have left,

04:29.310 --> 04:33.314
but I do know my boy needs me.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.860
There is something wrong.
I know it.

04:36.901 --> 04:42.032
I--
will you please take my case?

04:42.073 --> 04:43.908
* *

04:43.950 --> 04:45.285
- You sure she can make it
through

04:45.326 --> 04:46.745
a live press conference?

04:46.786 --> 04:47.996
- I offered to just record
a video of her,

04:48.038 --> 04:49.289
but she was adamant.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.457
she wants to be there
in-person.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.750
So I'm taking my cues from her.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.797
What, Dhan?
- I didn't say anything.

04:57.839 --> 05:01.760
- Once we step into that room,
it's go time.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.553
So if you have a problem,
speak now

05:03.595 --> 05:05.597
or forever hold your peace.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.017
- David's on drugs.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.727
It explains
why he moves around a lot,

05:10.769 --> 05:12.312
why Rachel
won't go to the cops.

05:12.354 --> 05:15.106
This kid wasn't taken.
He's just off using somewhere.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.524
- He's an addict.
Fine.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.984
That doesn't mean
we don't look for him.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.736
- Doesn't mean
he wants to be found either.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.614
David's life is his fault.
It's his choice

05:22.655 --> 05:24.074
to get high and hurt his mom.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.160
I'm sorry,
but this is not our problem.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.871
- Every missing person
is our problem, Dhan.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.040
That's what makes us different
from the cops.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.958
- Fine.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.504
But I'm telling you right now,
taking this case is a mistake.

05:37.545 --> 05:41.966
* *

05:42.008 --> 05:43.760
- So David's into
a bit of dirt.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.970
He's been in and out of rehab
and jail for seven years.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.847
Three months ago,
he was busted buying pills

05:47.889 --> 05:50.725
from a local dealer and was
court ordered to AA meetings.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.394
- That was shortly after
his mom got sick.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.688
Up until three months ago,
his social media was littered

05:54.729 --> 05:57.482
with photos of him and Rachel.
Then his posts just stopped.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.150
- They were clearly very close.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.444
- Her diagnosis must've been
difficult for him to handle.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.531
- Which I bet is what triggered
him to relapse and disappear.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.533
- Laws can break people.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.952
Margaret,
what was your read on Lucas?

06:08.993 --> 06:10.704
- He rubbed his eyes
any time that Rachel

06:10.745 --> 06:12.414
mentioned David, which is
a sign of disagreement.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.707
I think we should talk
to him alone.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.375
- Set it up.
I'm right behind you.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.460
We need to find out the
location of David's meetings.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.045
These people
are likely his tribe.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.922
If anyone knows something,
it's them.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.757
- If David's court ordered,
Trent could get us that--

06:22.799 --> 06:24.592
- Rachel doesn't wanna
involve the cops.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.594
We won't go to Trent
unless we need to.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.221
- I can find
the meeting address.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.973
- You know what?
I got it.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.018
Zeke, see if you can go into
David's arrest records instead.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.519
Track down his dealer.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.521
If David really is on a bender,
they'll know where he is.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.398
Dhan, talk to
David's using friends.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.983
Lacey, talk to David's
sober friends,

06:40.025 --> 06:44.487
if there's any left.
- Can I switch with Lacey?

06:44.529 --> 06:46.990
* *

06:47.032 --> 06:50.118
- Thank you for making the time
to talk to us again so quickly.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.579
- Well, I was gonna
reach out to you anyway.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.539
I couldn't speak
openly earlier,

06:54.581 --> 06:55.957
not without upsetting my aunt.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.125
[phone ringing]

06:57.167 --> 06:59.002
- I'm so sorry.

06:59.044 --> 07:02.797
- Rachel idolizes David,

07:02.839 --> 07:05.258
but he's been a mess
since Elisa's death.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.386
* *

07:08.428 --> 07:11.056
- It's still painful for you.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.893
- Elisa fell off a ladder
and died.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.270
David found her.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.439
He was only 15 years old.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.734
To this day,
Rachel blames herself.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.779
She knew the ladder was faulty
but didn't replace it,

07:25.820 --> 07:28.615
and David's used her guilt
to bleed her dry financially

07:28.656 --> 07:30.408
and emotionally ever since.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.952
- Is that why
you kicked him out?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.204
I know addicts.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.289
David wouldn't leave
a free place to stay.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.249
* *

07:38.291 --> 07:39.751
- David was a mess.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.712
He came home one night
high as a kite.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.965
He flooded my guest house.
Next day, he got arrested.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.426
I told him not to contact us
till he got clean.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.761
I didn't know he and Rachel

07:49.803 --> 07:51.137
were still talking
on the phone.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.764
- Thank you, Lucas.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.683
We are going to do everything
we can to find David.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.351
- Wait, you still
want to take his case,

07:56.393 --> 07:58.186
after everything
I just told you?

07:58.228 --> 07:59.479
- Don't you want us to?

07:59.521 --> 08:01.398
- Rachel has spent
her life in pain.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.816
She lost her daughter.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.485
Then she lost her son
to drugs.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.278
I want her to die in peace.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.241
- Trust me, Lucas,
I understand your position,

08:11.282 --> 08:12.701
but even if he is high,

08:12.742 --> 08:14.911
David will regret
not seeing his mom.

08:14.953 --> 08:18.665
- If my cousin wanted Rachel
in his life, he'd be sober now.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.250
Maybe not being there
for my aunt

08:20.291 --> 08:23.003
is the reality check he needs
to get clean for good.

08:23.044 --> 08:26.172
You all are so kind and caring,

08:26.214 --> 08:31.761
but I need to protect my aunt,
which is why I'm firing you.

08:31.803 --> 08:35.598
* *

08:40.145 --> 08:40.353
.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.855
- To be clear, we are profiling
a victim, not a perpetrator.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.859
We're not dealing with some
twisted psychopath this time.

08:45.900 --> 08:50.739
[tense music]

08:50.780 --> 08:53.742
- So you don't think
David was kidnapped?

08:53.783 --> 08:55.118
- No.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.828
And I don't need
your opinion on addiction.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.997
The only reason
I'm bringing you in

08:59.039 --> 09:00.999
is because I need to work fast.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.959
It's important to me
to give David back

09:03.001 --> 09:05.503
one of the many things
you took from me.

09:05.545 --> 09:09.883
* *

09:13.386 --> 09:16.097
I'm not eating
until I call my dad.

09:16.139 --> 09:20.185
I read those bookmarked pages,
and you're wrong.

09:20.226 --> 09:23.396
My father never neglected me.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.065
He did his best.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.691
- Did his best include

09:26.733 --> 09:27.984
missing
the most important moments

09:28.026 --> 09:29.986
of your life,
like your birthday?

09:30.028 --> 09:31.696
- Losing my mom
was hard for him.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.908
But that's why he needs me,
to make sure he packs his lunch

09:34.949 --> 09:36.201
and wears his winter gloves

09:36.242 --> 09:37.869
so his hands
don't get too cold.

09:37.911 --> 09:41.206
- Your father
should've taken care of you.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.292
What you're experiencing
now is euphoric recall.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.169
I mean,
it's easy to forget the times

09:46.211 --> 09:50.674
you cried about his absence.
Saving him is an addiction.

09:50.715 --> 09:54.094
Calling him will be a relapse.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.054
And if you don't stop asking--

09:56.096 --> 09:58.223
- Let me save you the trouble.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.683
* *

09:59.724 --> 10:02.852
Until you let me call him,

10:02.894 --> 10:05.563
I won't eat.

10:05.605 --> 10:09.067
If I don't eat, I die.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.820
Then you're no longer
a kidnapper.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.656
* *

10:14.698 --> 10:16.533
You're a murderer.

10:16.574 --> 10:20.537
* *

10:20.578 --> 10:21.913
- I have bad news.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.415
David's phone is disconnected.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.958
I can't track it.
- You find the dealer?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.376
- That's the other thing.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.794
His recent arrest record
has been sealed.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.379
- Why?
He's not under 18.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.715
- All I know is
it's inaccessible, even by me.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.258
- You get anything
from the friends?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.093
- The ones he got high with
assumed he got sober.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.012
Everyone else
assumed he relapsed.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.596
- Did they know
where he was living?

10:38.638 --> 10:39.764
[phone ringing]

10:39.806 --> 10:41.266
- Did Lucas give you anything?

10:41.307 --> 10:43.268
- Just details
about Elisa's death.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.602
You can get that.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.438
- It's not important.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.815
Hey, Zeke, can you try to find
the interview that David gave

10:48.857 --> 10:50.275
the cops the night Elisa died?

10:50.316 --> 10:51.776
I mean, if she's the source
of the trauma

10:51.818 --> 10:53.278
that he's been
self-medicating for,

10:53.319 --> 10:55.113
it might be helpful to us.
- Yeah, on it.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.448
- While Zeke is searching
for that video, Margaret,

10:56.489 --> 10:58.324
why don't you head down
to the DCPD?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.368
See if Trent can give us
anything on the dealer.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.287
- Dahn, Lacey, we're gonna go
to David's AA meeting.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.080
- What about
the press conference?

11:04.122 --> 11:05.290
I mean, we could use
the media exposure, right?

11:05.331 --> 11:08.460
- We need more to go on first.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.170
- Gabi, you're not gonna
tell them that Lucas fired us?

11:10.211 --> 11:12.088
- Not yet.
- Gabi.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.882
- Margaret, trust me,
Rachel's health is declining.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.633
We need to move.

11:15.675 --> 11:19.846
[soft dramatic music]

[upbeat music]

11:22.974 --> 11:24.976

11:25.018 --> 11:28.146
- We in the right place?
- Don't act so surprised.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.190
Recovery's not supposed
to be depressing.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.193
Remember, this is anonymous,

11:33.234 --> 11:35.945
so no one's gonna talk
to people they don't trust.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.906
Follow my lead.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.036
Are these saved?
- All yours.

11:43.078 --> 11:46.373
You're new here?
- No, but my friend is.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.672
- I'm Leo.
You are?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.340
- Mike.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.342
- You're in the right place,
Mike.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.845
Everyone, this is Mike.
He's new here.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.683
* *

12:04.724 --> 12:07.185
I'm surprised
you all found this place.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.020
We're not listed
in the directories.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.106
- An acquaintance
told us about it.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.274
His name is David.
Do you know him?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.485
- David H.?
I sponsor him.

12:15.527 --> 12:19.072
We were supposed to meet up
earlier, but he never showed.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.950
- Was it for step work?
- Yeah.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.369
Are you in recovery too?
- No.

12:24.411 --> 12:28.206
I've done a lot
of research for Mike.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.084
- I fear David went out again.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.585
No one at the house
has heard from him,

12:32.627 --> 12:36.047
and, well, it never gets easier
watching someone

12:36.089 --> 12:37.882
lose their battle
with addiction.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.427
- You mentioned no one
in the house heard from David?

12:40.468 --> 12:42.595
Was he living here?
- Yes.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.472
This is sober living.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.350
The owner of the facility
just lets me hold my group here

12:47.392 --> 12:49.853
as part of my 12-step work.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.022
- Are there
any rooms available?

12:52.063 --> 12:53.565
* *

12:53.606 --> 12:56.568
- Why can't Lacey do this?
- Stop whining, Mike.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.653
[phone rumbles]

12:58.695 --> 13:01.906
- Margaret, talk to me.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.909
- Is it just me or does she
know a lot about recovery?

13:04.951 --> 13:08.038
- I'll take care of it.
Just head back to the office.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.875
- A lot of recovering addicts
keep a journal.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.002
Find David's.

13:14.044 --> 13:15.587
- Gabi?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.964
[soft dramatic music]

13:18.006 --> 13:19.841
- You must be Mike.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.344
I'm Jesse.
I own the place.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.429
I hear you're
looking for a bed.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.931
I only take ten clients
at a time,

13:26.973 --> 13:28.600
but this kid
didn't show for curfew.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.101
Don't worry.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.394
Everything will be gone
before you move in.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.896
- Is he coming
back for any of it?

13:32.937 --> 13:34.189
- Doubtful.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.857
- What happens
to all their stuff?

13:35.899 --> 13:37.359
- I have a storage unit
out back I'll put his stuff in.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.777
Poor kid didn't sign
a HIPAA form,

13:38.818 --> 13:41.279
so I couldn't let
his family know he was here.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.741
So what made you decide
to get sober, Mike?

13:44.783 --> 13:47.327
- I got high and ruined
my best friend's life.

13:47.369 --> 13:50.622
Can I see the laundry room?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.416
All my clothes
are hypoallergenic.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.585
- Yeah.

13:55.627 --> 14:02.676
* *

14:05.345 --> 14:06.971
- Gabi,
I can't tell you anything

14:07.013 --> 14:09.057
I didn't tell Margaret.
- I didn't come here to talk.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.351
I came in
to look at David's file.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.816
It's completely redacted.
- Told you.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.776
Sorry.
- It's fine.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.987
Can you bring up information
on sober living houses

14:23.029 --> 14:25.407
the DCPD is aware of
in the area?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.660
- Just emailed it to you.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.745
- Thank you.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.872
- Gabi, wait.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.457

14:34.499 --> 14:36.835
Down by the lake
with your father's ashes,

14:36.876 --> 14:40.463
you opened up, we connected.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.799
It felt like
a real moment for us.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.676
[tender music]

14:44.718 --> 14:47.679
- Moments are fleeting.

14:47.721 --> 14:51.474
* *

14:51.516 --> 14:53.977
- Sorry.
I got lost up there.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.938
- As I was telling your friend,
if cost's an issue,

14:56.980 --> 14:58.398
I take insurance.

15:01.234 --> 15:05.113
- We'll let you know.
- Of course.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.700
- You get it?

15:11.161 --> 15:14.581
- So who's Mike?

15:14.622 --> 15:17.208
- No one.
It's called improv.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.966
- Finally.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.218
- Did you find the interview?
- Yeah, check it out.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.221
[somber music]

15:30.263 --> 15:32.349
* *

15:32.390 --> 15:34.726
- I was in my room studying.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.228
I heard a scream
from the kitchen.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.564
* *

15:39.606 --> 15:44.152
When I found her,
her body was--

15:44.194 --> 15:46.571
there was so much blood.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.239
* *

15:48.281 --> 15:50.241
- You were home alone?

15:50.283 --> 15:56.164
* *

15:56.206 --> 15:58.583
- This is who
we are looking for,

15:58.625 --> 16:02.212
a trauma survivor,
just like us.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.881
- We have to stop looking
for David right now.

16:04.923 --> 16:07.217
- I am not having
this conversation again.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.220
- This is a letter from Lucas.
He fired us.

16:10.261 --> 16:14.933
* *

16:14.974 --> 16:16.976
Wait.
Did you know?

16:17.018 --> 16:19.062
- Rachel hired us, not Lucas.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.856
We have a lead
on David's dealer.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.233
- Gabi, please tell me
you didn't find that

16:23.274 --> 16:24.818
in David's DCPD file.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.986
- The dealer has to be
a confidential informant.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.114
It's why Trent isn't talking.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.615
This should have
their information.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.450
Lacey, take this over
to Zeke's to decrypt.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.618
- So what,
we're going rogue now

16:33.660 --> 16:35.120
and stealing from the police?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.996
- I knew this case
was a mistake.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.124
- Gabi, where is the line?

16:39.165 --> 16:41.543
- There is no line,
not when it comes

16:41.584 --> 16:44.963
to reuniting a dying woman
with her son.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.131
Now do your job.

16:46.172 --> 16:53.388
* *

16:57.392 --> 16:57.600
.

16:57.642 --> 16:58.643
- This may take some time.
- I'll wait.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.149
- You avoiding Gabi?

17:04.190 --> 17:07.527
- What is it about this case
that's making her so reckless?

17:07.569 --> 17:09.487
It's like she's breaking
every law I know.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.989
- I thought that's why
you were in law school,

17:11.031 --> 17:14.200
to learn how to protect us
from getting prosecuted.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.244
- Yeah, but how
can I protect her

17:16.286 --> 17:17.620
if she continues
to undermine me?

17:17.662 --> 17:19.581
- No one tells Gabi
what to do, Lace,

17:19.622 --> 17:21.875
not even with
the best of intentions.

17:25.879 --> 17:28.506
- Gabi hasn't been herself
in months.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.675
[soft dramatic music]

17:30.717 --> 17:34.596
- You mean since her dad died?

17:34.637 --> 17:36.431
Hey, grief shows up
in different ways.

17:36.473 --> 17:38.350
I mean, just look at David.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.310
- It's not--it's not grief.

17:40.352 --> 17:44.272
It's--it's something else.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.691
- "The first pill
gave me wings.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.985
"The second took away the sky.

17:49.027 --> 17:54.115
"I kept using because I thought
maybe next time,

17:54.157 --> 17:57.369
the sky wouldn't disappear."

17:57.410 --> 17:58.703
- Well, that's
pretty beautiful.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.289
Did David write that?
- Yeah.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.291
It's David step work journal.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.876
Normally,
it would be off-limits,

18:04.918 --> 18:07.921
but until we talk to the CI,
we have no other leads.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.674
- I mean, I can see
why David upset Rachel.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.634
He stole
her prescription pain meds,

18:12.676 --> 18:15.470
repeatedly told her
that she couldn't save him.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.223
- He doesn't mention Elisa
anywhere in there though.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.517
She should have
her own entry here.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.060
- You sound so sure about that.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.813
- Everything David wrote
is a part of his ninth step.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.523
Elisa may be gone,

18:26.564 --> 18:28.441
but he would still want
to make an amends to her.

18:28.483 --> 18:30.652
- Well, maybe he did.

18:30.694 --> 18:32.445
Look, there seems
to be a page missing.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.782
* *

18:35.824 --> 18:38.535
- We need to find it.
- What aren't you telling me?

18:38.576 --> 18:39.869
[phone rumbles]

18:39.911 --> 18:41.454
- I could ask you
the same thing.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.248
You've been ignoring calls
all day.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.084
- It's--
I mean, it's just a therapist.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.294
- I didn't know
you started seeing someone.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.338
- Well, no.
I haven't yet.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.881
I mean, it's just--

18:51.923 --> 18:53.591
I'm just--
I'm just making inquiries.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.218
Between my daughter
showing up out of the blue

18:55.260 --> 18:58.555
and the false lead on Jamie,
the boat's, you know,

18:58.596 --> 19:00.265
been a little rocky lately.

19:00.306 --> 19:04.019
- Maybe talking to a therapist
will help you create room

19:04.060 --> 19:06.354
for both Taylor and Jamie.

19:06.396 --> 19:09.274
Making room for one
doesn't have to mean

19:09.315 --> 19:11.276
giving up on the other.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.945
* *

19:13.987 --> 19:15.822
- OK.
Your turn.

19:15.864 --> 19:19.659
- Gabi.
- What's happened?

19:19.701 --> 19:21.786
- I've been scanning
hospital admittances

19:21.828 --> 19:26.124
for David, and Rachel
was just admitted.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.127
[dramatic music]

19:29.169 --> 19:31.296
[siren blaring distantly]

19:31.338 --> 19:34.341
- [coughs]
I'm sorry.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.634
- You have nothing
to be sorry for.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.970
Just don't give up,
Rachel, please.

19:39.012 --> 19:42.807
- God.
If only my body would listen.

19:42.849 --> 19:47.270
Gabi, are you any closer
to finding my boy?

19:47.312 --> 19:49.731
- We have some leads.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.608
- That means you know about--

19:51.649 --> 19:53.485
- David is not defined
by his addiction.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.528
He's a good kid.

19:55.570 --> 19:58.490
- I'm sorry
I wasn't honest with you.

19:58.531 --> 20:02.911
I just wanted you to see David
the way I see him.

20:02.952 --> 20:06.539
He loved his sister Elisa
more than anything,

20:06.581 --> 20:08.458
and if she--
she hadn't died--

20:08.500 --> 20:11.002
- Rachel,
I am going to find him.

20:11.044 --> 20:14.589
I will reunite you
with your son.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.634
- I just wish
we could reach him.

20:17.676 --> 20:20.345
I wish that he knew

20:20.387 --> 20:24.641
that there's not much time.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.267
- Well, maybe we can.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.769
If we post a video
on our Instagram,

20:27.811 --> 20:29.521
you can talk to him directly,

20:29.562 --> 20:31.606
and even if he doesn't see it,
maybe somebody he knows might.

20:31.648 --> 20:35.360
- Oh, yes.
Yes, yes.

20:35.402 --> 20:38.363
[coughing]

20:38.405 --> 20:39.739
- Hi, David.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.033
My name is Gabi Mosley.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.703
I am with your mother.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.996
She doesn't have
much time left,

20:47.038 --> 20:52.377
and the only person she wants
right now with her is you.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.921
I understand
that all you want to do

20:54.963 --> 20:59.217
is hide so you don't have
to face the pain that's coming.

20:59.259 --> 21:03.555
I'm not here to stop you,
but I want to remind you,

21:03.596 --> 21:05.473
you have a chance with her

21:05.515 --> 21:08.393
that you didn't have
with your sister,

21:08.435 --> 21:11.896
the chance to say goodbye.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.898
* *

21:13.940 --> 21:17.819
- David, please.

21:17.861 --> 21:21.281
I just want to hold your hand
before I go.

21:21.322 --> 21:26.703
* *

21:26.745 --> 21:29.205
- Gabi, I got it,
the name of the CI.

21:29.247 --> 21:31.374
- Zeke, you're my hero.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.251
Hold on just a little longer.

21:33.293 --> 21:37.047
We're bringing David home.
- Oh, my God.

21:37.088 --> 21:40.800
* *

21:40.842 --> 21:42.844
- I appreciate you showing up.

21:42.886 --> 21:44.721
- I may disagree with you,
but I'll always have your back.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.264
- You bring the cash?

21:46.306 --> 21:53.563
* *

21:55.982 --> 21:58.068
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

21:58.109 --> 22:00.779
They were bribing me
for information.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.740
- Mira, get in the car.

22:03.782 --> 22:05.825
What the hell, Gabi?

22:05.867 --> 22:07.952
I know you stole
that thumb drive.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.080
How could you put
our CI at risk like that?

22:10.121 --> 22:13.041
- She might be the only one
who knows where David is.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.211
- I don't care.
This is my job.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.921
Now, look, clearly
something is going on--

22:17.962 --> 22:20.465
- I need to talk to her, Trent.
- Hey, Gabi--

22:20.507 --> 22:23.635
- Get the hell out of her way.
[grunts]

22:23.677 --> 22:25.637
- Dhan Rana,
you are under arrest

22:25.679 --> 22:27.180
for obstruction of justice.

22:27.222 --> 22:29.182
* *

22:33.269 --> 22:33.478
.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.396
- Seriously, Trent?
Let him go.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.816
- Be grateful you're
not in there with him.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.610
- Don't push me.

22:40.652 --> 22:44.030
- Threats, Gabi?
What has gotten into you?

22:44.072 --> 22:46.408
- Stop being
a little bitch, Trent.

22:46.449 --> 22:47.909
- David's mom is dying.

22:47.951 --> 22:50.578
I just need to give her
one last moment with him.

22:50.620 --> 22:51.955
- I can't.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.624
If anything happens to Mira,
it's on me.

22:54.666 --> 22:57.127
- If Rachel dies
before she sees David,

22:57.168 --> 22:58.503
it's on me.

22:58.545 --> 23:01.965
- Someone should've told me
this was about David.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.425
I wanna talk to her.

23:03.466 --> 23:05.677
* *

23:05.719 --> 23:07.595
[phone rumbles]

23:07.637 --> 23:09.472
- Gabi, what's up?

23:09.514 --> 23:10.932
- Jesse Winfield,

23:10.974 --> 23:12.684
he owns Turning Bridge
Sober Living House.

23:12.726 --> 23:14.769
I need everything
on him and his business.

23:14.811 --> 23:17.647
- So he's a suspect now?
He was so nice.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.149
- According to David's dealer,
he's not.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.026
Jesse only lets people
move in

23:21.067 --> 23:22.527
who he doesn't think
will stick around.

23:22.569 --> 23:25.030
He convinces them
to not sign HIPAA release forms

23:25.071 --> 23:27.282
so he can't tell family
members when they leave.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.284
- How many beds were in Jesse's
sober living house?

23:29.325 --> 23:30.577
- I'm not sure,
but he said he only takes

23:30.618 --> 23:32.162
ten clients at a time.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.955
- Well, according to the
insurance companies he bills,

23:33.997 --> 23:36.207
there's 50 people living there.
- What?

23:36.249 --> 23:39.502
Where are the other 40 clients?
- I'm searching for them now.

23:39.544 --> 23:43.131
[dramatic music]

23:43.173 --> 23:45.842
Most of them are dead,
overdoses.

23:45.884 --> 23:47.385
- So Jesse is killing clients

23:47.427 --> 23:49.095
and collecting
the insurance money?

23:49.137 --> 23:51.890
- We gotta go.
David might be in real trouble.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.059
* *

23:54.100 --> 23:57.228
- This is where Jesse said
he was holding David's stuff.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.064
- Or it could be where
he's keeping David

23:59.105 --> 24:01.858
if this is all
an insurance scam.

24:01.900 --> 24:09.074
* *

24:09.115 --> 24:11.284
- Mike?

24:11.326 --> 24:13.244
What are you doing here?

24:13.286 --> 24:15.038
- Where's David?

24:15.080 --> 24:18.249
[suspenseful music]

[siren whoops]

24:32.972 --> 24:40.230
* *

24:41.106 --> 24:43.566
- I'd never hurt David
or any of my clients.

24:43.608 --> 24:45.652
I don't need to.
They're addicts.

24:45.694 --> 24:46.778
They hurt themselves.
I swear.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.238
They take off on their own.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.948
- Yet you fail to tell
their insurance companies

24:49.989 --> 24:51.408
that they're gone.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.451
- So I bill their insurance
while filling

24:53.493 --> 24:54.994
their beds with new clients.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.913
Is working the system
to make my sober living

24:56.955 --> 24:58.581
more comfortable
really such a crime?

24:58.623 --> 25:01.334
- Yeah, it's called fraud.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.503
- You're sick for
taking advantage of people

25:03.545 --> 25:04.921
who come to you for help.

25:04.963 --> 25:07.173
[dramatic music]

25:07.215 --> 25:09.759
- Get up.
- What?

25:09.801 --> 25:11.678
I did nothing wrong.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.222
* *

25:14.264 --> 25:16.433
- Getting out of control.
I mean, we're--

25:16.474 --> 25:19.602
- I just finished
going through David's stuff.

25:19.644 --> 25:22.147
I found Elisa's journal page.

25:24.482 --> 25:26.985
What's going on?

25:27.027 --> 25:29.738
- Lucas saw your
Instagram Live with Rachel.

25:29.779 --> 25:31.865
He got the judge to issue
an emergency protective order.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.283
- Ignore it.
We're moving forward.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.826
- How?

25:34.868 --> 25:36.578
We can't get within 100 feet
of David, Lucas, or Rachel

25:36.619 --> 25:38.038
without facing charges.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.622
- We can make it around
a little red tape.

25:39.664 --> 25:42.292
- This isn't just red tape.
It's a restraining order.

25:42.334 --> 25:43.960
- Gabi,
maybe it's time to stop.

25:44.002 --> 25:46.171
- Damn it.
We are not giving up on him.

25:48.673 --> 25:49.924
I can't.

25:51.384 --> 25:54.804
I have to give Rachel and David
a chance to say goodbye.

25:54.846 --> 25:57.557
If David misses--

25:57.599 --> 25:59.476
- This is about
your father, isn't it?

25:59.517 --> 26:02.729
Gabi, he was sick.
- He was an alcoholic.

26:02.771 --> 26:05.523
[somber music]

26:05.565 --> 26:11.279
My father started drinking
when I was taken.

26:11.321 --> 26:15.909
Turns out, it wasn't so easy
to stop when I came home.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.161
It took me a long time
to realize

26:18.203 --> 26:21.664
he wasn't choosing alcohol
over me.

26:21.706 --> 26:23.583
* *

26:23.625 --> 26:26.628
It truly was an addiction.

26:26.670 --> 26:30.757
By the time he got sober,
his cirrhosis was terminal.

26:30.799 --> 26:35.679
And there was a lot left to fix

26:35.720 --> 26:38.431
between us before he passed.

26:38.473 --> 26:43.103
I didn't even
get to the hospital to--

26:43.144 --> 26:48.066
* *

26:48.108 --> 26:50.610
I will do anything
to give Rachel

26:50.652 --> 26:53.863
that one last moment...

26:53.905 --> 26:56.950
even if I have to do it alone.

26:56.991 --> 27:00.954
[dramatic music]

27:00.995 --> 27:02.914
David started using because

27:02.956 --> 27:04.791
he didn't get to say
goodbye to Elisa.

27:04.833 --> 27:07.877
High or not, he would want
to say goodbye to Rachel.

27:07.919 --> 27:10.213
So why isn't he
at the hospital?

27:10.255 --> 27:14.175
- You're upset, desperate,
your tone abandoned.

27:14.217 --> 27:16.553
You feel abandoned.

27:16.594 --> 27:18.972
[tense music]

27:19.014 --> 27:20.724
Notice I am here
as your partner

27:20.765 --> 27:22.267
when no one else is.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.395
I'm always the one
that is here for you.

27:25.437 --> 27:27.105
* *

27:27.147 --> 27:30.066
Please don't go.

27:30.108 --> 27:31.901
I want to help.

27:31.943 --> 27:38.700
* *

27:38.742 --> 27:42.537
- "Dear Elisa,
I am sorry for how you died.

27:42.579 --> 27:44.289
I'm sorry for lying."

27:44.330 --> 27:49.127
Lying?
Maybe David had a secret?

27:49.169 --> 27:51.087
Maybe that's what's keeping him
from Rachel?

27:51.129 --> 27:52.339
- When you brought me
this case,

27:52.380 --> 27:54.549
you asked me
to profile a victim.

27:54.591 --> 27:55.967
I have,

27:56.009 --> 27:58.178
but I've realized
it is your own inability

27:58.219 --> 28:00.638
to see David
as more than an addict

28:00.680 --> 28:03.975
that has caused you to have
a critical error in judgment.

28:04.017 --> 28:07.812
- I am the only one who sees
him as more than an addict.

28:07.854 --> 28:10.106
- But do you see
him as valuable?

28:10.148 --> 28:12.150
Because I do.

28:12.192 --> 28:15.779
David is vulnerable,
lonely, easy to dismiss,

28:15.820 --> 28:19.866
a victim no one would
think to look for.

28:19.908 --> 28:23.244
Well, no one, that is, but you.

28:23.286 --> 28:26.414
- David is
the perfect kidnap victim.

28:26.456 --> 28:29.292
What if he isn't getting high

28:29.334 --> 28:31.795
and was actually taken
by someone who knew

28:31.836 --> 28:33.463
everyone would assume that?

28:33.505 --> 28:35.215
- It might
not be David's secret

28:35.256 --> 28:37.467
keeping him from Rachel.

28:37.509 --> 28:39.636
- Maybe it's someone else's.

28:39.678 --> 28:44.516
* *

28:44.557 --> 28:47.352
- I've been watching
teen David's police interview,

28:47.394 --> 28:49.604
and when Lucas squeezes
David's shoulder,

28:49.646 --> 28:51.231
I thought
he was comforting him,

28:51.272 --> 28:52.816
but at a closer look,
he was controlling

28:52.857 --> 28:54.818
what David told the police.

28:54.859 --> 28:56.695
* *

28:56.736 --> 28:59.322
- So something happened
the night Elisa died,

28:59.364 --> 29:01.324
something Lucas
was trying to cover up.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.201
This whole time,
we thought he was

29:03.243 --> 29:05.245
protecting his family,
but he was just protecting

29:05.286 --> 29:08.581
his secret,
which means he didn't fire us

29:08.623 --> 29:10.458
because he wanted David
to get sober.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.419
- He fired us because
he didn't want David

29:12.460 --> 29:14.254
coming clean.
- Lucas has David.

29:14.295 --> 29:16.756
- Gabi, we have to be careful.
This man feels no guilt.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.842
That's why I didn't pick up
on anything.

29:18.883 --> 29:21.052

29:24.931 --> 29:25.348

29:25.390 --> 29:26.224
- Hey, no.
This is trespassing.

29:27.017 --> 29:28.351
- Like we care.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.020
This guesthouse is
mighty convenient.

29:30.061 --> 29:31.563
Gives you a space away
from Rachel when you need it.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.273
And it also
is conveniently a space

29:33.314 --> 29:35.316
she can't access
because of her wheelchair.

29:35.358 --> 29:36.609
- I saw you coming.

29:36.651 --> 29:38.111
I already called the cops.
- Good.

29:38.153 --> 29:39.195
Then they'll be here
to arrest you

29:39.237 --> 29:41.489
for kidnapping your cousin.

29:41.531 --> 29:44.242
- He showed up a few hours ago,
high out of his mind.

29:44.284 --> 29:46.494
I'm detoxing him
so he can see his mom.

29:46.536 --> 29:50.040
- David, I'm Gabi.
Your mom hired me to find you.

29:50.081 --> 29:53.501
She's in the hospital.
- Gabi, we have to go now.

29:53.543 --> 29:55.879
- David, do you want
to see your mom?

29:55.920 --> 29:58.006
- Hey, in here officers.

[tense music]

29:59.424 --> 30:00.842

a lot of time left.

30:03.011 --> 30:04.471
- David, is your--
is your cousin holding you

30:04.512 --> 30:06.681
against your will?
OK. Look at me.

30:06.723 --> 30:08.141
Look at me.
Nod. Squeeze my hand.

30:08.183 --> 30:10.185
I won't let him hurt you.
- David.

30:10.226 --> 30:12.020
They're confusing him.

30:12.062 --> 30:13.855
- Hey, you don't want
your mom to see you this way.

30:13.897 --> 30:16.232
Do you?
Do you?

30:16.274 --> 30:18.193
- He didn't relapse.
Did he?

30:18.234 --> 30:20.653
- Yo, get them off my property.

30:20.695 --> 30:25.367
- David, did Lucas drug you?
Is this about Elisa?

30:25.408 --> 30:29.162

30:29.204 --> 30:33.917
- My mom, the truth...

30:33.958 --> 30:37.337
he doesn't want me
telling the truth.

30:37.379 --> 30:39.172
- And what is the truth David?

So Lucas gave
a full confession.

Apparently, he's been
manipulating David for years,

35:14.322 --> 35:16.324
trying to keep his secret,
providing him with money

would blame them both

When David finally
hit 90 days sober,

35:22.247 --> 35:23.915
he reached out to Lucas,

35:23.957 --> 35:26.793
told him he was coming clean
to Rachel, part of his amends.

his aunt

and was holding him

No one should keep
a child away from a parent.

put away for a long time.
