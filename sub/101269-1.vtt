Hey buddy,

01:50.719 --> 01:51.387
Can you hear me?

01:51.454 --> 01:52.654
Open your eyes for me.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.622
- He's not breathing.
- Gonna heck pulses here.

01:54.689 --> 01:55.490
We don't have a pulse.

01:55.557 --> 01:56.425
Go ahead and start compressions.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.727
- Starting 30 over two.
- Bags.

01:58.793 --> 02:00.029
We need to
do a rhythm check.

02:00.096 --> 02:01.730
Okay we have V-fib
on the monitor.

02:01.796 --> 02:02.664
Go ahead and clear the chest.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.666
- I'm charging to 360.
- Clear.

02:04.733 --> 02:05.935
And shock.

02:06.002 --> 02:08.104
Okay, all right
back on the chest.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.205
We're still without a pulse.

02:09.270 --> 02:12.640
Let's go with one
milligram IV epinephrin.

02:12.707 --> 02:13.808
Have the epi ready.

02:13.876 --> 02:14.877
He's still not breathing.

02:14.944 --> 02:16.145
All right,
we got V-fib again.

02:16.212 --> 02:17.179
I'm gonna go ahead and
charge for the second time.

02:17.246 --> 02:19.814
- Charging, clear the chest.
- Clear.

02:19.882 --> 02:21.750
All right, and shock.

02:21.816 --> 02:23.052
Okay, pulseless.

02:23.119 --> 02:25.854
Let's go ahead with another
milligram of epinephrin.

02:25.921 --> 02:27.890
- Come on buddy.
- Still in V-fib.

02:27.957 --> 02:29.158
- Come on, come back.
- Gonna charge one more time

02:29.225 --> 02:30.960

02:31.027 --> 02:32.028
- Go ahead and clear.
- Clear.

let's fucking do it, you know.

07:48.310 --> 07:50.312
We need something
new, something fresh,

07:50.379 --> 07:53.949
with a lot of fucking
noise, you know.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.684
Again, if you know
anybody with a bass

07:55.751 --> 07:56.819
it's gonna be so fucking huge,

07:56.885 --> 07:59.988
like I could play the

08:08.263 --> 08:11.166

beautiful man.

08:11.233 --> 08:13.168
Slim was absolutely
insane, you know,

08:13.235 --> 08:15.003
a complete nihilistic
and anarchist,

08:15.070 --> 08:16.405
what ever you wanna call it,

08:16.472 --> 08:17.573
at times he was downright evil.

08:17.639 --> 08:20.309
But I loved his energy,
he had a screw loose,

08:20.376 --> 08:22.311
I mean his brain was
fucked just like mine.

08:22.378 --> 08:23.645
We were the same.

08:23.712 --> 08:27.316
We even started a band but
only ever played one gig.

You'll never get another
gig in this fucking city.

08:55.444 --> 08:57.746
Society will
strangle you if you let it.

08:57.813 --> 08:59.481
I've been suffocating
for too long

08:59.548 --> 09:01.750
and finally I could breathe.

09:01.817 --> 09:03.485
No alarm to wake up to,

09:03.552 --> 09:06.054
nothing scheduled,
no small talk,

09:06.121 --> 09:09.258
no ties to anything and
nothing to care for.

09:09.324 --> 09:13.996
Free to explore, to do
whatever the fuck I wanted.

09:14.062 --> 09:15.230
Raleigh was our plug.

09:15.297 --> 09:17.166
He could get you anything
you could ever need.

09:17.232 --> 09:20.569
Speed, DMT, coke,
molly, zanies, atties,

09:20.636 --> 09:24.173
ketamine, codeine,
LSD, guns, girls, guys,

09:24.239 --> 09:25.541
body organs, you name it.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.675
I do have some fucking weed
too if you wanna come down

09:26.742 --> 09:31.780
and just sorta relax
and mellow the fuck out.

09:31.847 --> 09:33.415
You wouldn't know
it by looking at him,

09:33.482 --> 09:37.386
but Raleigh came from
some serious money.

09:37.453 --> 09:39.188
His parents live in one
of those swanky suburbs

09:39.254 --> 09:40.322
on the edge of the city

09:40.389 --> 09:42.324
and that's where he
whipped up his supply,

09:42.391 --> 09:44.226
right under their noses.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.128
I'm telling you, this
is all the best shit

09:46.195 --> 09:47.362
you can get around here.

09:47.429 --> 09:48.163
Mommy and daddy thought
their honor student

09:48.230 --> 09:51.033
would be a chemist one day,

09:51.099 --> 09:52.234
or maybe a lawyer.

09:53.869 --> 09:57.105
Drugs and deaths were what
really got him off though.

09:57.172 --> 09:59.208
He wanted to be a mortician.

09:59.274 --> 10:04.279
I guess that's why he spent
all the time in the graveyard.

10:05.314 --> 10:06.548
We kept him around
because he cut us a deal

10:06.615 --> 10:08.817
and made us laugh, but he
never had to worry about

10:08.885 --> 10:12.154
his next meal or a
dry place to sleep.

10:12.221 --> 10:13.555
He wasn't one of us.

11:10.546 --> 11:12.447
Thanks man, yeah, fuck.

11:18.287 --> 11:20.289
Come on you dumb fuckers.

11:22.524 --> 11:23.425
Hello.

11:24.359 --> 11:26.261
Fuck yeah man, thanks.

11:27.696 --> 11:31.199
No, in your fucking
little bicycle car.

11:33.368 --> 11:34.570
What about you,
you got any change?

11:34.636 --> 11:35.704
You're on your
fucking headphones

11:35.771 --> 11:39.207
you god damn fucking
cocksucker, fuck you.

11:39.274 --> 11:40.609
Nice jeep, fucker.

11:42.511 --> 11:43.412
Fuck.

12:46.274 --> 12:50.445
It's amazing how quickly
my appearance went to shit.

12:50.512 --> 12:53.682
I almost didn't
recognize myself.

12:53.749 --> 12:55.550
I mostly saw hatred.

12:56.585 --> 12:58.587
I hated what I'd become.

12:59.621 --> 13:00.722
Fuck you.

13:30.819 --> 13:34.256
It wasn't long before I was
sick of the dumpster diving,

13:34.322 --> 13:36.692
the begging for
change, stealing shit.

13:36.758 --> 13:38.061
I needed to get a job,

13:38.127 --> 13:39.361
something that would give me
enough change in my pocket

13:39.428 --> 13:44.199
to get a fucking hamburger
and a few cold beers.

13:59.414 --> 14:00.482
So you have a car?

14:00.549 --> 14:01.349
You got a phone number
I can reach you at?

14:01.416 --> 14:02.085
Is this your first taxi gig?

14:02.151 --> 14:04.786
You know ah, ah, um.

14:04.853 --> 14:05.587
The fuck does that mean?

14:05.654 --> 14:06.388
Either you do or you don't.

14:06.455 --> 14:08.356
How 'bout a home address?

14:10.392 --> 14:11.194
But it's...

14:11.259 --> 14:12.694
Are your license up to date?

14:12.761 --> 14:13.762
Not exactly.

14:13.829 --> 14:15.363
I don't know it off
the top of my head,

14:15.430 --> 14:16.431
I just moved into this new place

14:16.498 --> 14:18.067
and I think they're
doing some rezoning

14:18.134 --> 14:19.401
or something like that.

14:19.468 --> 14:22.071
I suspect an acquaintance
of mine to have stolen it,

14:22.138 --> 14:23.238
but I can't prove
that and obviously

14:23.305 --> 14:25.340
he's not going to admit
it if he did steal it,

14:25.407 --> 14:26.408
so I can't help you there.

14:26.475 --> 14:29.478
I'm crashing with
a friend of mine.

14:29.544 --> 14:34.083
I don't actually have a
functioning license at this time.

14:34.150 --> 14:35.151
I'm in all sorts of shit.

14:35.218 --> 14:37.452
Punk, metal, doom
metal, stoner metal.

14:37.519 --> 14:38.787
Is it suspended?

14:38.854 --> 14:40.722
Indi rock, new rock, new
wave, no wave, chill wave,

14:40.789 --> 14:42.858

I'm into it man.

14:46.129 --> 14:47.529

gonna deliver pizzas

14:47.596 --> 14:49.865

14:49.932 --> 14:50.933

you gonna drive

14:51.000 --> 14:54.569

14:54.636 --> 14:56.371
Fuck it, can you start now?

15:08.951 --> 15:10.685
What the hell is this,
what are you doing here?

15:10.752 --> 15:11.954
There's a line.

15:12.021 --> 15:13.755
Yeah man, I was just
doing some product testing,

15:13.822 --> 15:15.457
a little bit of market research.

15:15.524 --> 15:16.725
Ah, what?

15:16.792 --> 15:17.859
When do I get a break?

15:17.927 --> 15:19.561
You know what, this
isn't gonna work out,

15:19.628 --> 15:21.696
get the fuck out of here.

15:22.798 --> 15:25.600
What the fuck
are you looking at?

16:12.714 --> 16:13.615
Woo.

16:26.828 --> 16:28.597
It's like a fucking
race around here,

16:28.663 --> 16:30.432
it looks so fucking crazy man.

16:30.498 --> 16:33.202
Oh yo, hey, hey man, can
I get a butt from you?

16:33.269 --> 16:35.004
Do you have an extra cigarette?

16:35.071 --> 16:36.038
I just need one.

16:36.105 --> 16:37.006
Craig said he was
gonna come down.

16:37.073 --> 16:37.873
- Yeah sure.
- But I don't think

16:37.940 --> 16:38.740
he's gonna make it anymore man.

16:38.807 --> 16:41.043
I just think it's just gonna me

16:50.920 --> 16:52.889
Hey dude, do you have
any change on you

16:52.955 --> 16:53.822
or anything like that?

16:53.890 --> 16:54.991
- No, sorry bud.
- No, no change,

16:55.057 --> 16:55.992
no change at all,

16:56.058 --> 16:57.726
- no dollar bills or something?
- No.

16:57.792 --> 16:58.895
- Not at all?
- No sorry.

16:58.961 --> 17:01.496
No, no, no, there's
no cops around here man.

17:01.563 --> 17:02.331

17:13.976 --> 17:15.877
I got what I needed.

17:15.944 --> 17:18.512
I was tryna talk
about my consciousness

17:18.579 --> 17:19.814
and stuff like
that 'cause I think

17:19.882 --> 17:21.715
if we can just put
it all together.

17:21.782 --> 17:24.853
So she's like the virgin
and she takes out a room

17:24.921 --> 17:28.423
and that becomes the
savior of mankind.

17:31.626 --> 17:36.631
♪ The wheels on the bus
go round and round ♪

17:39.101 --> 17:41.569
And I just couldn't...

17:41.636 --> 17:43.906
You can do it, you can do it.

17:52.915 --> 17:54.849
I'd never been so low.

17:54.917 --> 17:56.252
After all that job shit,

17:56.319 --> 17:59.854
it was time to put an end to
the misery and embarrassment.

17:59.922 --> 18:02.291
I was ready to go
out, I really was.

18:02.358 --> 18:03.993
Wasn't the first time I
had tampered with the idea

18:04.060 --> 18:06.963
of taking death
into my own hands.

18:08.697 --> 18:10.699
Depression chews you
up and spits you out,

18:10.765 --> 18:11.968
it gives you tunnel vision,

18:12.034 --> 18:14.303
and all you see is the
bullshit you can't control,

18:14.370 --> 18:16.604
things that pin you down.

18:17.872 --> 18:20.042
Moms face when she
hears the news.

18:20.109 --> 18:21.609
They said my brain was fucked,

18:21.676 --> 18:23.545
they saw the scars on my wrist.

18:23.611 --> 18:25.014
This wasn't that.

18:25.081 --> 18:27.782
Lose time, something final,

18:27.849 --> 18:30.585
time to rest, to quiet my mind,

18:32.054 --> 18:33.755
to end the battle.

19:14.997 --> 19:16.065
Okay, okay.

19:22.171 --> 19:23.205
Give me 10.

19:23.272 --> 19:27.143
10, aren't you good
with usually three?

19:27.209 --> 19:29.011
What gives Bug?

19:29.078 --> 19:30.845
Just do your job.

19:30.913 --> 19:33.748
Listen, if I hear you've
been flippin' this shit,

19:33.815 --> 19:35.051
like those K pins I sold you.

19:35.117 --> 19:38.686
I'm not flippin' shit,
they're for me, all right?

19:38.753 --> 19:42.091
Only a coward takes
10 in a single dive Bug.

19:42.158 --> 19:44.692
You trying to off yourself?

19:46.028 --> 19:47.063
Holy shit you are.

19:47.129 --> 19:49.398
Do you have the
fucking pills or not?

19:49.465 --> 19:51.699
Fucking chill out dude.

19:58.908 --> 20:02.011
So, what are your
plans post-mortem?

20:03.879 --> 20:05.414
What the fuck does that mean?

20:05.481 --> 20:06.449
Are you an organ donor?

20:06.515 --> 20:08.417
- Jesus Christ.
- I'm just saying,

20:08.484 --> 20:11.686
that shit gets real expensive,

20:11.753 --> 20:14.756
I can take care of your
cadaver for you if you want.

20:14.823 --> 20:15.623
My cadaver.

20:15.690 --> 20:18.227
Yeah, you know, your corpse.

20:18.294 --> 20:20.795
So long as your cool
with me cutting you up

20:20.862 --> 20:22.932
and poking around some shit.

20:22.998 --> 20:24.766
You can make a pretty
penny selling organs

20:24.833 --> 20:26.202
on the black market these days.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.802
Yeah, can ya?

20:32.007 --> 20:36.011
You are a sick bastard,
you know that don't you?

20:36.946 --> 20:40.615
Is that a yes?

20:59.268 --> 21:02.837
It's sort
of like the ocean,

21:02.905 --> 21:04.106
or out of space,

21:06.041 --> 21:08.843
or hell, it's sort of like hell.

21:11.280 --> 21:15.084
I had seen all the stone
and brick and cement,

21:15.151 --> 21:19.787
all the garbage and glass
and endless piles of shit,

21:19.854 --> 21:23.192
all the scum no one
will look in the eyes.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.861
It's all one thing now.

21:32.968 --> 21:34.203
It's like one of those dreams

21:34.270 --> 21:38.140
where the faster you try
to run the slower you go.

21:38.207 --> 21:38.941
Quicksand.

21:41.377 --> 21:42.744
The louder you try and yell

21:42.810 --> 21:45.247
the more stifled your cries are.

21:47.216 --> 21:49.218
The depths of the ocean,

21:50.319 --> 21:52.888
the farthest parts of space.

21:55.357 --> 21:58.793
Hell is so much closer
than I could of imagined.

22:27.122 --> 22:29.724
Ah.

22:50.879 --> 22:52.281
Joe, that's what...

22:52.348 --> 22:55.817
No it wasn't, Joe okay, I know,

22:55.884 --> 22:56.986
it's just, it's fine.

22:57.052 --> 23:00.222
Raleigh, I knew I'd
find you here.

23:00.289 --> 23:02.157
- Oh, you little piece of shit.
- It was a sham Bug.

23:02.224 --> 23:04.226
I got hosed, it wasn't
one of my batches,

23:04.293 --> 23:06.996
my shit has been moving so fast

23:07.062 --> 23:09.098
I had to pick up
from the Koreans.

23:09.164 --> 23:10.599
The shit was watered down.

23:10.666 --> 23:13.168
They sold fucking sugar pills.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.806
Everyone's out for blood.

23:19.441 --> 23:20.909
How do you think I feel?

23:20.976 --> 23:23.012
How do I think you feel?

23:23.078 --> 23:25.381
How do I think you feel Raleigh?

23:25.447 --> 23:29.051
I don't give a fuck how
you feel you stupid.

23:29.118 --> 23:29.952
Fuck off.

23:34.189 --> 23:37.192
I just tried to
kill and I failed,

23:39.094 --> 23:42.031
you know how
embarrassing that is?

23:42.097 --> 23:43.899
I feel like garbage.

23:46.335 --> 23:48.037
- I've never been this hungover.
- Hey.

23:49.405 --> 23:51.140
Look at it this way man,

23:51.206 --> 23:54.943
you've got a second chance
at life here, you know?

23:55.010 --> 23:58.280
This is like some divine
intervention shit.

23:58.347 --> 24:00.916
Fucking God touched you Bug.

24:02.217 --> 24:03.218
Fuck God.

24:08.457 --> 24:10.092
I just wanna die.

24:12.027 --> 24:12.928
Okay.

24:28.310 --> 24:31.947
Hey, hey, it takes a
real kind of fuck up

24:33.248 --> 24:34.283
to botch pulling the trigger,

24:34.350 --> 24:38.020
and don't get me wrong,
you're a fuck up,

24:38.087 --> 24:41.357
so I'm gonna make this
really clear here.

24:43.258 --> 24:44.126
Get up.

24:49.164 --> 24:50.232
Just squeeze.

25:00.209 --> 25:01.110
Boo.

25:06.181 --> 25:09.952
So Raleigh tells me
you're tryna off yourself.

25:10.018 --> 25:14.022
Raleigh's bent, the
supplies counterfeit too,

25:14.089 --> 25:16.091
don't go to him.

25:16.158 --> 25:17.226
Just hold for a
night would you?

25:17.292 --> 25:18.961
There's this show down
at the Doll House,

25:19.027 --> 25:20.362
this band Nice Guys is playin',

25:20.429 --> 25:21.497
and the last time
they were there

25:21.563 --> 25:23.732
the lead singer jumped
from the rafters

25:23.799 --> 25:25.367
into the pit, broke his shoulder

25:25.434 --> 25:26.502
and nearly paralyzed himself,

25:26.568 --> 25:31.507
which is pretty punk
if you ask me.

25:35.611 --> 25:40.082
And I also got some killer
crank and some ecstasy.

I didn't take you

29:54.736 --> 29:58.540
I'm not really.

29:58.607 --> 30:01.410
I went to church a lot as a kid,

30:02.577 --> 30:06.381
I lived in this group
home with Jesus freaks.

30:07.616 --> 30:11.720
The whole bible thumping,
cross facing the toilet kind.

30:15.724 --> 30:18.427
Nothing bad ever
happened on Sunday

30:18.493 --> 30:21.697
so I guess it just
kinda stuck with me.

30:25.534 --> 30:27.269
What about you, hm?

30:29.838 --> 30:31.606
What do you believe?

30:36.344 --> 30:37.612
Nothing really.

30:38.915 --> 30:41.650
I mean, we weren't
religious growing up,

30:41.717 --> 30:44.453
my mom was but that's about it.

30:45.888 --> 30:48.490
Kid that lived next
door to me though,

30:48.557 --> 30:52.527
him and his family went
to church every Sunday

30:52.594 --> 30:56.832
and he ended up getting
molested by his priest

30:56.899 --> 30:58.800
- or something.
- Geez.

30:58.867 --> 31:01.470
He didn't tell
anyone for years.

31:01.536 --> 31:02.571
It was a big deal
for a week or two

31:02.637 --> 31:04.573
and then nothing, most people,

31:04.639 --> 31:09.444
they didn't wanna believe
it or they didn't care.

31:09.511 --> 31:11.246
I saw it eat him up.

31:13.582 --> 31:15.751
Fucking destroyed him, but,

31:17.385 --> 31:19.321
they say that
happens all the time,

31:19.387 --> 31:23.492
priest screwing around
with kids and stuff.

31:23.558 --> 31:26.394
I don't know, that and a
whole bunch of other things

31:26.461 --> 31:30.465
made me pretty convince
that religion is a scam.

31:34.469 --> 31:37.305
Well, this crash
is gonna suck.

31:38.507 --> 31:41.676
I wish I had a joint
to come down with.

31:45.514 --> 31:48.350
Maybe I can help
out with that.

32:14.843 --> 32:17.579
I feel pretty good now though.

32:18.847 --> 32:20.315
What about you?

32:22.584 --> 32:23.886
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

32:23.953 --> 32:25.154
Mm-hmm.

32:27.689 --> 32:29.691
That night I had it all.

32:31.660 --> 32:34.897
Jenny was cool, she was like me.

32:34.964 --> 32:37.866
There was this
tightness in my chest,

32:37.934 --> 32:40.669
some vacancy had been filled.

32:40.735 --> 32:42.939
I know that people don't change,

32:43.005 --> 32:45.507
but maybe parts of them do.

32:46.741 --> 32:48.844
Something changed in me.

32:48.911 --> 32:50.846
The highs were
always really high,

32:50.913 --> 32:53.548
and the lows always really low,

32:53.615 --> 32:55.885
but this high felt different.

32:57.019 --> 32:58.820
- Nothing?
- Oh shit.

33:01.023 --> 33:02.657
- You got it.
- I did get it.

33:02.724 --> 33:03.592
You hear that one before?

33:03.658 --> 33:04.961
No.

33:05.027 --> 33:08.597
I was just more evil than the
devil and greater than God

33:08.663 --> 33:10.900
or contradictory terms.

33:51.706 --> 33:52.909
- Yes.
- Woo.

33:52.975 --> 33:53.675
Yes.

33:53.742 --> 33:55.878
Yeah.

33:55.945 --> 33:57.545
What a lovely time.

33:57.612 --> 33:59.447
I'm so proud.

34:01.549 --> 34:02.885
How many we got left?

34:02.952 --> 34:04.853
I don't know.

34:06.788 --> 34:07.756
I gave you one.

34:07.822 --> 34:11.525
Yeah, thank you
very much for that.

34:11.592 --> 34:12.694
Bug?

34:13.929 --> 34:14.964
What?

34:16.831 --> 34:17.866
Come here.

34:47.096 --> 34:49.630
It's Tina's brother.

34:49.697 --> 34:51.466
What, the hooker?

34:57.839 --> 35:00.608
Oh shit, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, I know this kid,

35:00.675 --> 35:02.044
he's a fag.

35:02.111 --> 35:04.947
Must've been the HIV
caught up to him.

35:05.014 --> 35:06.916
Shut the fuck up Slim.

35:06.983 --> 35:08.918
Well it could've been.

35:08.985 --> 35:09.986
It wasn't.

35:14.756 --> 35:16.624
Fucking gross.

35:16.691 --> 35:20.595
Just, must've took a
hit too strong I guess.

35:23.032 --> 35:24.133
Could've been anyone.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.335
No, no, no, no, no,
this kid was a junkie.

35:26.402 --> 35:29.138
You didn't fucking know him.

35:29.205 --> 35:30.940
Neither did you.

35:31.007 --> 35:33.608
His sister hooks and he
liked the needle in the cock.

35:33.675 --> 35:35.677
Shut the hell up Slim.

35:37.779 --> 35:39.647
Could've been anybody.

36:09.078 --> 36:10.745
Don't be a baby.

36:21.856 --> 36:26.661
Maybe it was a hot dose
or something, I don't know.

36:26.728 --> 36:27.729
Raleigh said that there

36:27.796 --> 36:29.831
was some synthetic
shit moving around.

36:29.899 --> 36:31.901
No, no, no, that
kid was a junkie,

36:31.967 --> 36:34.036
he would've died from
the needle eventually.

36:34.103 --> 36:36.939
If he was a junkie
then what are we, huh?

36:37.006 --> 36:40.809
I'm not a junkie,
you're a junkie.

36:40.876 --> 36:42.677
I'll never be a
slave to a substance.

36:42.744 --> 36:46.714
I like to think of myself
as a recreational user.

36:46.781 --> 36:49.051
My ass, you're a speed freak.

36:49.118 --> 36:50.920
So are you.

36:50.986 --> 36:54.190
Well I'm not hooked,
I'm just skimming.

36:54.256 --> 36:56.058
Besides, those pills you
guys get off of Raleigh

36:56.125 --> 36:57.159
are way stronger than anything

36:57.226 --> 37:01.063
that kid would've
been able to shoot up.

37:05.201 --> 37:07.103
Yeah, look at that.

37:07.169 --> 37:08.837
- Bad ass.
- It's pretty good, right?

37:08.904 --> 37:10.139
Yeah, not bad.

37:13.909 --> 37:16.112
We roasted in the putrid
bubble of brick buildings

37:16.178 --> 37:17.913
and side walks.

37:17.980 --> 37:20.615
The pavement charred my edges.

37:22.151 --> 37:24.253
Summer wasn't all bad though,

37:24.320 --> 37:26.956
that's when the
city came to life.

37:27.022 --> 37:30.993
I like to start early to
avoid the midday heat.

37:33.028 --> 37:35.030
The days blended together,

37:35.097 --> 37:39.101
and this one started
out just like the rest.

38:03.959 --> 38:06.128
Fletcher, what
are you doing man?

38:06.195 --> 38:09.165
This is glass, you got
plastic here, all right?

38:09.231 --> 38:13.735
This is glass, plastics
go down there, okay?

38:13.801 --> 38:14.702
See?

38:18.073 --> 38:22.011
Oh, right at the
deli, for Christ sakes.

38:22.077 --> 38:24.046
Would you look at that.

38:25.581 --> 38:26.949
This place stinks.

38:28.584 --> 38:32.021
It reminds me of one time
I was working for the CIA.

38:32.087 --> 38:36.525
They had me in a basement,
no windows, one desk,

38:36.592 --> 38:38.160
tapping the phone conversations

38:38.227 --> 38:40.930
of the families upstairs.

38:40.996 --> 38:42.998
They weren't feeding their kids.

38:43.065 --> 38:45.000
It was abuse, you know?

38:46.235 --> 38:49.771
It'd been months,
listening to phone calls.

38:51.106 --> 38:53.876
It's patient work,
let me tell ya.

38:53.943 --> 38:55.777
And my wife, my wife,

38:56.345 --> 38:58.981
she was gonna be in the films.

39:00.249 --> 39:04.119
Those kids, they were so
skinny before the feds came,

39:05.187 --> 39:07.189
nearly burnt the house down.

39:07.256 --> 39:09.857
My wife, she never
wanted any kids.

39:09.925 --> 39:11.927
She smells like daisies.

39:14.129 --> 39:15.965
Just a few more of these bottles

39:16.031 --> 39:19.034
and I'll be punching
my ticket home.

39:20.302 --> 39:21.904
She's in the films you know?

39:21.971 --> 39:24.306
Yep, yep, you said that.

39:24.373 --> 39:28.143
Well looks like you're
all set Mr. Fletcher.

39:30.646 --> 39:33.215
Two 25, you wouldn't
be ripping me off

39:33.282 --> 39:34.383
now would you Bug?

39:34.450 --> 39:36.952
For real man, that's
all you had, all right?

39:37.019 --> 39:39.321
Plastics go down there,

39:39.388 --> 39:42.024
so take the rest
of these plastics

39:42.091 --> 39:43.993
and go down there.

39:44.059 --> 39:45.227
And you might wanna
try hitting your spots

39:45.294 --> 39:46.262
a little bit earlier

39:46.328 --> 39:47.196
all right, there's
the Korean dudes

39:47.263 --> 39:48.497
I've been seeing
around recently,

39:48.564 --> 39:51.333
I think they're beating you
to the punch, all right?

39:51.400 --> 39:53.002
You're a good kid Bug.

39:53.068 --> 39:55.104
See you tomorrow.

40:06.482 --> 40:08.984
Fathers
day at Paul park,

40:09.051 --> 40:11.620
early with a couple of home
runs in the second inning.

40:11.687 --> 40:14.256
Maybe it's
going up here in the sixth

40:14.323 --> 40:16.791
and now we're all tied up.

40:17.393 --> 40:19.261
Is that date right?

40:19.328 --> 40:21.863
What, do you
live under a rock?

40:21.930 --> 40:22.931
Holy shit.

40:24.700 --> 40:26.635
It's my fucking birthday today.

40:26.702 --> 40:28.203
Congratulations.

40:30.706 --> 40:31.907
All right.

40:34.343 --> 40:37.413
Can I get one of
those whiskey bottles?

40:37.479 --> 40:39.214
Nah, the small one.

40:50.259 --> 40:51.226
Thanks man.

40:52.561 --> 40:57.333
So I look up at the sign and
can't fucking believe it,

40:58.467 --> 41:01.370
June 18th, today's
my 21st birthday.

41:03.272 --> 41:04.239
- Hey.
- Yes.

41:05.441 --> 41:07.176
Happy birthday Bug.

41:07.242 --> 41:08.310
- Thanks.
- Holy shit dude,

41:08.377 --> 41:09.712
you're only 21?

41:09.778 --> 41:12.014
Yeah, funny thing is I've
been buying booze of that dude

41:12.081 --> 41:13.248
for three years.

41:14.750 --> 41:18.287
But I blew the last
of my cash on this,

41:18.354 --> 41:20.422
so I think lunch is gonna
have to be on Eddie.

41:23.125 --> 41:24.326
Oh man, just
think about it dude,

41:24.393 --> 41:27.129
21 years ago on this exact date

41:27.196 --> 41:30.699
you are spit out
of your mums twat.

41:30.766 --> 41:32.201
That's fucking great.

41:32.267 --> 41:33.135
- Yeah.
- I'm just telling it

41:33.202 --> 41:34.203
like it is man.

41:34.269 --> 41:36.138
Everybody thinks
childbirth is some kind

41:36.205 --> 41:39.074
of fucking miracle, you
ever fucking see one?

41:39.141 --> 41:41.710
It's a brutal,
painful, bloody mess.

41:41.777 --> 41:43.045
It's worst than a
fucking snuff film,

41:43.112 --> 41:45.314
all for the sake of having
some little bastard around,

41:45.381 --> 41:50.386
24/7, shittin' and crying
and chewing on your nipples.

41:52.054 --> 41:53.122
That's why I'll
never have one.

41:53.188 --> 41:55.457
Yeah, people think
babies are so pure too.

41:55.524 --> 41:58.427
Yeah, like they
come from above.

41:58.494 --> 41:59.561
When most of the time,

41:59.628 --> 42:01.430
they're the result of
something absolutely

42:01.497 --> 42:02.531
completely fucking meaningless.

42:02.598 --> 42:06.301
I mean, my parents,
they're not in love,

42:06.368 --> 42:08.370
and they probably weren't
when they made me.

42:08.437 --> 42:10.506
We're the same as every
other little scurrying rodent

42:10.572 --> 42:15.444
on this skid, and we're here
for the same reason, to die.

42:16.545 --> 42:18.113
Yeah, and then?

42:18.180 --> 42:21.183
And then, and
then, and then what?

42:22.317 --> 42:24.253
There is no and then,
there is no after that,

42:24.319 --> 42:28.323
we're born, we fuck, we
live, we die, that's it.

42:29.358 --> 42:30.459
No, what, do you
think plants and fish

42:30.526 --> 42:33.028
and bugs and rats and
dogs have an afterlife?

42:33.095 --> 42:34.530
I mean, they don't.

42:34.596 --> 42:36.398
Look, we aren't special,

42:36.465 --> 42:38.767
and if we aren't special,
animals are fucked,

42:38.834 --> 42:40.269
just frankly fucked.

42:40.335 --> 42:41.437
The difference
between the species

42:41.503 --> 42:44.273
is that we're smarter,
we are so much smarter,

42:44.339 --> 42:45.274
so much smarter
that at some point

42:45.340 --> 42:46.608
we realized the
best way to survive

42:46.675 --> 42:50.112
is to convince ourselves
that each and every one of us

42:50.179 --> 42:52.047
is the most important
breathing bastard

42:52.114 --> 42:54.149
on a planet filled with
unspeakable numbers of breathing...

42:54.216 --> 42:54.950
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

42:55.017 --> 42:56.118
watch where you're fucking

42:56.185 --> 42:56.819
- going ass whole.
- Take a shower shit bag.

42:56.886 --> 42:57.953
Hey, come say that

42:58.020 --> 43:00.322
- to my face.
- Oh, you wanna make something

43:00.389 --> 43:01.123
out of this, guy, get the
fuck out of the car your swid.

43:01.190 --> 43:02.458
- Pussy.
- What the fuck?

43:02.524 --> 43:05.427
Fucking people these days
man, Jesus fucking Christ.

43:05.494 --> 43:07.329
I mean, look at
Tina's brother, right?

43:07.396 --> 43:09.531
Someones kid, someones
brother obviously,

43:09.598 --> 43:11.133
where is he now?

43:11.200 --> 43:14.169
Rotting away under
a fucking bridge.

43:15.504 --> 43:19.475
I mean face it, people don't
care if one us lives or dies.

43:19.541 --> 43:21.376
Well that is very grim Bug,

43:21.443 --> 43:25.347
and spoken like a guy
who's tryna off himself.

43:26.883 --> 43:28.584
Are you tryna off yourself?

43:28.650 --> 43:29.518
No.

43:31.320 --> 43:34.590
Well, yeah, kinda, I
mean, I was I guess.

43:41.230 --> 43:43.365
Come on mother fucker.

43:43.432 --> 43:44.266
What?

43:52.909 --> 43:56.078
Hey Eddie, you got what
I'm lookin' for today?

43:56.144 --> 43:57.579
I thought you were gonna quit.

43:57.646 --> 43:59.615
These things will
kill you you know,

43:59.681 --> 44:01.517
I don't want that to happen.

44:01.583 --> 44:04.152
Oh, you're so sweet Eddie.

44:04.219 --> 44:05.354
You know, one of these
days someone's gonna come

44:05.420 --> 44:07.322
walking right through that door.

44:07.389 --> 44:09.157
I hope she's as cute as you.

44:09.224 --> 44:10.225
But I hope she doesn't smoke,

44:10.292 --> 44:12.861
those things will
kill you you know.

44:12.929 --> 44:15.297
I loved to take you on
a date sometime Jenny,

44:15.364 --> 44:16.865
you could come over my house,

44:16.933 --> 44:19.234
my mom makes really
good beef stew.

44:19.301 --> 44:21.537
That sounds so nice Eddie,

44:22.671 --> 44:25.440
but you know I'm kinda
with Bug now, right?

44:25.507 --> 44:27.676
He could come too,
not Slim though,

44:27.743 --> 44:30.312
'cause he's a piece of shit.

44:31.513 --> 44:33.515
Hey Eddie, how's it going man?

44:33.582 --> 44:35.617
Fine thanks, what are
you guys get in to today?

44:35.684 --> 44:37.452
It's Bug's birthday today.

44:37.519 --> 44:39.288
Oh, happy birthday Bug.

44:39.354 --> 44:42.157
You know, you share the same
birthday as my cousin Mark,

44:42.224 --> 44:43.893
he's a real piece
of shit though.

44:43.960 --> 44:47.563
Anyway, I got a little
something for you.

44:47.629 --> 44:50.332
You know, being your
birthday and all.

44:50.399 --> 44:53.402
One in four million odds to
win the jackpot on that thing.

44:53.468 --> 44:56.204
If it's a winner, don't
forget who gave you this.

44:56.271 --> 44:57.040
Okay Bug?

44:57.105 --> 44:59.508
Who gave what to me Eddie?

45:02.544 --> 45:04.279
I'm just kidding with you man,

45:04.346 --> 45:05.314
and thanks, this is great.

45:05.380 --> 45:08.283
Hey Eddie, how
'bout one for me?

45:08.350 --> 45:10.419
Go to hell Slim.

45:10.485 --> 45:13.155
I'm all ready there my dude.

45:26.702 --> 45:29.605
You know, if you
died, I'd care.

45:33.642 --> 45:38.313
If you were cold and alone
something, I'd go to sleep.

46:02.337 --> 46:03.238
Hi.

46:05.340 --> 46:08.243
Fucking dopey
fucking, you stupid.

46:09.678 --> 46:10.679
Get the fuck back here.

46:10.746 --> 46:13.615
Fuck you.

46:13.682 --> 46:16.485
God damn it, I'm
gonna fucking kill you.

46:16.551 --> 46:18.620
Gonna hit you so fucking hard
your hair's gonna grow back.

46:31.566 --> 46:34.503
Picking out a
tombstone for yourself?

46:34.569 --> 46:35.637
Very funny.

46:36.973 --> 46:40.642
Thought you would've offed
yourself by now, coward.

46:40.709 --> 46:42.511
Where's my gun?

46:42.577 --> 46:43.578
I hid it.

46:43.645 --> 46:44.546
Where?

46:45.547 --> 46:47.182
Somewhere safe.

46:48.550 --> 46:50.752
It's in a safe place.

46:50.819 --> 46:53.755
Well what happened, jam
up on you or something?

46:53.822 --> 46:55.390
No, it's just,

46:58.493 --> 47:00.562
unforeseen circumstances.

47:02.731 --> 47:03.465
Jenny?

47:04.866 --> 47:06.768
Yeah, you know her?

47:06.835 --> 47:08.637
Everyone knows her.

47:10.472 --> 47:12.541
Listen man, I'm gonna
save you some heartache

47:12.607 --> 47:15.744
here all right, she's
just well known.

47:18.881 --> 47:19.648
Fuck off.

47:19.715 --> 47:20.749
She's in for the dope man.

47:20.816 --> 47:23.785
Just be careful,
that's all I'm saying.

47:23.852 --> 47:25.554
Speaking of dope.

47:26.521 --> 47:27.422
Yes?

47:29.624 --> 47:32.360
Well, do you have any or not?

47:34.796 --> 47:38.567
Real shit or the Korean Tic
Tac's you sold me last time?

47:38.633 --> 47:40.869
You'll feel like you
died and went to heaven.

47:40.937 --> 47:42.537
This is brand new shit,

47:42.604 --> 47:45.307
straight pharmaceuticals, uncut,

47:45.373 --> 47:48.777
it's called Dilaudid,
even stronger than Oxies.

47:53.448 --> 47:54.649
Got ya.

47:57.753 --> 47:58.587
Hey Raleigh.

47:58.653 --> 47:59.521
Hey Jen.

48:00.689 --> 48:02.390
It's Bug's birthday today.

48:02.457 --> 48:05.727
No shit, happy birthday
you son of a bitch.

48:05.794 --> 48:07.462
Let's celebrate.

48:07.529 --> 48:08.730
Oh, fuck yes.

48:08.797 --> 48:10.699
We are broke though.

48:11.666 --> 48:12.701
Course you are.

48:12.768 --> 48:16.404
Although in light
of a special someones

48:16.471 --> 48:20.109
very special day, maybe
you could hook us up.

48:20.176 --> 48:21.576
Pretty please?

48:23.478 --> 48:25.714
Only if I get to pop
off with you dweebs.

48:25.781 --> 48:27.516
Of course.

48:30.786 --> 48:32.821
Yes, thank you very much.

48:35.925 --> 48:37.659
To Bug's birthday.

48:37.726 --> 48:38.627
To Bug's birthday.

48:38.693 --> 48:40.362

48:57.914 --> 49:02.151

49:15.730 --> 49:16.832
Yay.

49:19.035 --> 49:21.503
Steven, what d'ya think?

49:23.872 --> 49:27.809
It's awesome.

49:34.616 --> 49:36.785
What were they like?

49:36.852 --> 49:38.620
Who?

49:38.687 --> 49:40.622
Your parents.

49:41.590 --> 49:43.758
You said they were in love.

49:46.262 --> 49:47.696
How did you know?

49:48.998 --> 49:51.566
One time I ditched school,

49:53.835 --> 49:55.403
came home early.

49:57.606 --> 50:00.775
I didn't expect my
dad to be there,

50:00.842 --> 50:02.544
his car wasn't in the driveway,

50:02.611 --> 50:06.715
but when I got in the house
I could hear his voice

50:08.583 --> 50:10.585
coming from the bedroom.

50:13.755 --> 50:15.657
Then a woman laughing.

50:17.692 --> 50:18.961
It wasn't my mom.

50:20.595 --> 50:22.530
Did you confront him?

50:27.802 --> 50:30.405
Well, did you tell your mom?

50:33.075 --> 50:35.978
Probably should of.

50:36.045 --> 50:40.782
Instead I just started fucking
everything up, you know?

50:42.084 --> 50:44.053
Mm-hmm.

50:44.120 --> 50:46.923
At least you know your parents.

50:46.989 --> 50:48.623
I never met mine.

50:50.825 --> 50:54.596
One time in a foster
home I broke this vase,

50:55.730 --> 50:58.968
turned out it was
like 200 years old.

50:59.035 --> 51:01.603
Worth more than my life.

51:01.670 --> 51:04.706
And my foster dad,
he screamed at me,

51:06.108 --> 51:10.845
and he said, you're just like
your no good whore mother

51:12.348 --> 51:15.583
who couldn't even
afford an abortion.

51:16.751 --> 51:18.753
So it's, it's something.

51:26.996 --> 51:29.531
I think about my mom a lot.

51:29.597 --> 51:31.934
She always saw the best in me.

51:33.135 --> 51:35.570
Wish I'd been better for her.

51:35.637 --> 51:38.573
When's the
last time you saw her?

51:38.640 --> 51:40.675
Three years ago today.

51:40.742 --> 51:42.477
That's when I left.

51:47.749 --> 51:50.852
What do you
wanna do today Bug?

51:50.920 --> 51:52.821
It's your special day.

51:54.823 --> 51:56.491
I wanna go home.

52:55.251 --> 52:57.819
So we're doing this again?

53:02.158 --> 53:04.393
He's not coming back,

53:04.460 --> 53:09.098
the sooner you accept that
the better off we'll both be.

53:16.972 --> 53:19.774
It's been three
years god damn it.

53:19.841 --> 53:22.844
What makes you think
he's comin' back now?

53:22.912 --> 53:27.116
Oh Christ Jo, for all we
all know he might even be...

53:29.051 --> 53:32.888
I'm just saying, this
isn't helping anything.

53:50.172 --> 53:50.906
We're you goin'?

53:50.973 --> 53:53.608
I'm going to find my son.

53:54.877 --> 53:56.845
Fine, but I'm drivin',

53:56.912 --> 54:01.616
and we're not gonna stay out
all night like last year.

54:11.759 --> 54:14.096
Did that stuff
help with the pain?

54:14.163 --> 54:16.798
Yeah, but I need more.

54:16.865 --> 54:18.467
Well, I'm gonna
have wait another two hours

54:18.534 --> 54:20.469
before I can give
you another does.

54:20.536 --> 54:21.769
I need it now.

54:23.272 --> 54:26.475
What would you
say your pain level is?

54:26.542 --> 54:29.879
Eight or nine.

54:29.945 --> 54:32.882
Okay, but you're
gonna have take this one

54:32.948 --> 54:34.250
with some food.

54:34.316 --> 54:35.217
Fine.

54:41.157 --> 54:45.027
So, chicken
sandwich or salad?

54:45.094 --> 54:46.761
Whatever works.

54:47.296 --> 54:49.031
Salad it is then.

54:53.969 --> 54:57.805
Should've
gone with the chicken.

54:57.872 --> 55:00.775
Have you ever
had hospital food?

55:00.842 --> 55:01.577
No.

55:02.878 --> 55:05.214
Trust me, it doesn't matter.

55:06.315 --> 55:09.285
What does matter, I
got the extra dose.

55:10.352 --> 55:14.290
There you go.

55:17.359 --> 55:19.028
Thank you Emily.

55:23.098 --> 55:25.334
You're up.

55:25.401 --> 55:27.970
- I've never been.
- Where?

55:28.037 --> 55:32.107
Europe, never been,
but I've heard it's nice.

55:32.174 --> 55:33.775
It's beautiful.

55:33.841 --> 55:35.144
You've been there?

55:35.211 --> 55:39.181
Yeah, I did the last semester
of my clinical in London.

55:39.248 --> 55:40.715
That's cool.

55:43.419 --> 55:46.155
Sorry for freaking out earlier.

55:48.390 --> 55:51.126
No worries, I've seen worst.

55:51.193 --> 55:55.830
The ER on a Friday night
can be a pretty scary place.

55:58.866 --> 56:02.271
Do you remember anything
about the accident?

56:04.139 --> 56:05.040
Yeah.

56:07.276 --> 56:09.278
There's a chunk missing.

56:10.980 --> 56:14.083
The driver,
was he a friend?

56:18.053 --> 56:18.954
No.

56:20.122 --> 56:23.058
I'd like for you to
be honest with me here.

56:23.125 --> 56:26.996
It's important, we're tryna
get in touch with his family.

56:27.062 --> 56:31.833
Good luck with that.

56:31.900 --> 56:34.169
Where is he, is he all right?

56:41.310 --> 56:43.312
He passed an hour ago.

56:45.481 --> 56:46.848
He's dead?

56:48.083 --> 56:49.051
Yes.

56:50.119 --> 56:52.087
He suffered severe
trauma to the head

56:52.154 --> 56:56.325
and it caused hemorrhaging
to the brain, I'm sorry.

57:02.298 --> 57:04.033
Any family we could contact?

57:04.099 --> 57:06.268
Do you know where he lives?

57:08.971 --> 57:10.406
I know where he slept.

57:10.472 --> 57:13.175
Where's that?

57:13.242 --> 57:15.210
You know Ringer Park?

57:16.478 --> 57:17.379
Mm-hmm.

57:19.381 --> 57:22.217
That's where he slept.

57:22.284 --> 57:23.185
I see.

57:26.155 --> 57:28.157
Is that where you sleep?

57:31.193 --> 57:32.094
Yep.

57:33.329 --> 57:35.197
How are you feeling?

57:35.264 --> 57:36.165
Any pain?

57:44.373 --> 57:45.840
This will help.

57:49.144 --> 57:50.245
What is it?

57:51.413 --> 57:55.250
This is a pain
medication called Dilaudid.

57:58.187 --> 58:00.389
It's lunch hour, you hungry?

58:03.359 --> 58:06.061
Should try and eat something.

58:06.128 --> 58:08.230
Chicken sandwich or salad?

58:09.131 --> 58:10.933
It doesn't matter.

58:47.035 --> 58:49.738
How far is your
parents house from here?

58:49.805 --> 58:54.143
It's at least 20 miles,
I mean, we can't walk.

58:54.209 --> 58:55.344
We could hitch.

58:55.411 --> 58:57.112
Yeah, we could try to hitch,

58:57.179 --> 58:58.747
we could end up just
gettin' flipped off

58:58.814 --> 59:01.517
on the side of the
freeway all night.

59:01.583 --> 59:04.753
No, I think train
is the best bet.

59:04.820 --> 59:05.821
Hey, hey man,

59:05.889 --> 59:06.789
- just a little bit?
- Nah, I'm sorry.

59:06.855 --> 59:08.056
- Nothin'?
- Yeah, well all right,

59:08.123 --> 59:08.190
at this rate we're not
gonna make it to Central.

59:10.259 --> 59:11.527
Dude, we'll be fine all right?

59:11.593 --> 59:13.262
It's like 15 stops.

59:13.328 --> 59:14.329
It'll be fine, we
don't make it to Central

59:14.396 --> 59:15.998
we don't get fucking
out of the city.

59:16.064 --> 59:18.267
- It's 10 bucks...
- Steve?

59:18.333 --> 59:19.401
Steven Bugsby.

59:21.069 --> 59:22.271
Do I know you?

59:23.572 --> 59:24.473
Kyle.

59:28.143 --> 59:30.078
We went to high school.

59:31.313 --> 59:32.781
We got suspended together

59:32.848 --> 59:33.917
- that time...
- For setting up

59:33.982 --> 59:36.485
Mr. Lafton's computer
on top of the school.

59:36.552 --> 59:39.154
- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.

59:39.221 --> 59:40.422
That was funny as hell.

59:40.489 --> 59:42.791
Dude, I remember that.

59:42.858 --> 59:45.093
My brother, you remember Cory?

59:45.160 --> 59:47.296
He's a senior now
and he was telling me

59:47.362 --> 59:50.999
people are still
talking about that shit.

59:53.435 --> 59:55.070
How's the family?

59:55.604 --> 59:57.105
They're good.

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:04.246
Smartest guy I
know right here.

01:00:04.313 --> 01:00:09.051
I would've failed English
if it wasn't for him.

01:00:09.117 --> 01:00:12.254
Hey Kyle, our van
kind of broke down

01:00:15.357 --> 01:00:17.593
a couple of blocks over, it's
one of those old clunkers,

01:00:17.659 --> 01:00:21.463
you know the type, you
think you could spare

01:00:22.397 --> 01:00:25.200
a couple of extra bucks for gas?

01:00:26.502 --> 01:00:27.402
Yeah.

01:00:28.537 --> 01:00:30.105
Yeah, of course.

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:38.146
Can any of you guys break a 20?

01:00:42.618 --> 01:00:43.685
Fuck it.

01:00:43.752 --> 01:00:49.224
Kyle fucking
Windsor, holy shit,

01:00:51.326 --> 01:00:54.229
who would've thought
man, oh my god,

01:00:54.296 --> 01:00:56.565
thank you, this is huge.

01:00:56.632 --> 01:00:58.333
Don't mention it.

01:01:00.636 --> 01:01:02.604
Well, I gotta get going,

01:01:04.439 --> 01:01:06.642
but good luck with your car.

01:01:08.176 --> 01:01:09.111
For sure.

01:01:11.246 --> 01:01:12.681
Thanks Kyle.

01:01:12.748 --> 01:01:14.182
Thanks Kyle.

01:01:19.221 --> 01:01:21.223
There's your ticket home.

01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:24.126
And then some,
let's get loaded.

01:01:24.192 --> 01:01:25.327
If you're gonna hang out here,

01:01:25.394 --> 01:01:26.495
you gotta buy something.

01:01:26.562 --> 01:01:28.597
Just give me a loosey
and I'll be on my way.

01:01:28.664 --> 01:01:29.933
I told you a million times,

01:01:29.999 --> 01:01:33.402
I can't do that anymore,
you can purchase a full pack

01:01:33.468 --> 01:01:34.636
or none at all.

01:01:34.703 --> 01:01:36.305
I wouldn't advise it though,

01:01:36.371 --> 01:01:38.240
those things will
kill you though.

01:01:38.307 --> 01:01:41.209
I know that Eddie,
that's why I only want one,

01:01:41.276 --> 01:01:44.446
if I get a whole pack I'll
smoke it all in an hour.

01:01:44.513 --> 01:01:46.548
Oh, I got a birthday
present for Bug,

01:01:46.615 --> 01:01:49.384
he's out there with you right?

01:01:49.451 --> 01:01:52.220
It's pulled beef stew my
mum brought me to eat,

01:01:52.287 --> 01:01:54.924
still hot, can you send him in.

01:01:54.991 --> 01:01:56.325
We're a little
busy right now Eddie,

01:01:56.391 --> 01:01:58.293
but I'll let him know.

01:02:00.629 --> 01:02:02.598
- Oh.
- Oh hey Raleigh,

01:02:03.665 --> 01:02:05.334
just the man we wanted to see,

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.568
you got any speed?

01:02:06.635 --> 01:02:09.404
Yeah, but no more
freebies for you tweekers.

01:02:09.471 --> 01:02:12.174
You guys couldn't
even afford one pill

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.409
with the change in that cup.

01:02:20.515 --> 01:02:22.317
Where the fuck you get that?

01:02:22.384 --> 01:02:25.354
Bug's got friends
in high places.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.289
Apparently.

01:02:27.356 --> 01:02:30.659
All right, what can
we get for 10 of these?

01:02:30.726 --> 01:02:32.327
One for each of you.

01:02:32.394 --> 01:02:35.731
Trust me, one is all
you guys'll need.

01:02:35.797 --> 01:02:37.532
This shit is heavy.

01:02:38.467 --> 01:02:39.735
Here you go, hey.

01:02:41.403 --> 01:02:44.740
And I'll even through
in a little bit of weed

01:02:44.806 --> 01:02:46.675
for the birthday boy.

01:02:46.742 --> 01:02:50.245
You guys are gonna need it to
keep your heads on straight.

01:02:50.312 --> 01:02:54.316
Weed and speed, it's a
match made in heaven Raleigh.

01:02:54.383 --> 01:02:57.219
That's right,
good night fuckers.

01:02:57.285 --> 01:02:58.353
Good night.

01:03:02.424 --> 01:03:03.692
All right.

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:16.438
What the fuck's the plan here,

01:03:16.505 --> 01:03:17.706
where are we going?

01:03:17.773 --> 01:03:20.609
I all ready told you
man, it's 20 stops maybe,

01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:22.411
15, I don't know, it's
been a fucking long time

01:03:22.477 --> 01:03:23.578
and I don't even know
where we are bro.

01:03:23.645 --> 01:03:27.016
Okay, cool, great,
so we're hop on drugs.

01:03:27.083 --> 01:03:28.650
Yeah, but we
just gotta keep moving

01:03:28.717 --> 01:03:31.386
'cause we're taking way
too much freaking time.

01:03:31.453 --> 01:03:32.721
We're
fucking moving dude,

01:03:32.788 --> 01:03:36.458
there's gotta be more trains
than just the one train.

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:44.733
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.335
Oh, fuck.

01:03:49.438 --> 01:03:52.207
Hold it right there.

01:03:57.446 --> 01:03:58.714
Evening.

01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:01.550
That doesn't smell
like tobacco smoke to me.

01:04:01.616 --> 01:04:03.052
Oh, that's a good one man.

01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:04.319
Hey, don't
get flip with me.

01:04:04.386 --> 01:04:08.390
Smoking marijuana in public
is a criminal offense.

01:04:08.457 --> 01:04:10.492
I could run the
through you right now.

01:04:10.559 --> 01:04:12.828
- Sorry man.
- What, you fucking kidding.

01:04:12.895 --> 01:04:14.763
It's
illegal, I told ya.

01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:16.065
- Yeah, all right.
- Against the car over there,

01:04:16.132 --> 01:04:17.332
all three of ya's, come on.

01:04:17.399 --> 01:04:18.366
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- We're just tryna get

01:04:18.433 --> 01:04:19.367
- to the train.
- Are you kidding me?

01:04:19.434 --> 01:04:19.936
Up
against the car now.

01:04:20.002 --> 01:04:22.237
I said move.

01:04:33.415 --> 01:04:35.383
Put your hands on
the back of our head.

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:36.518
- All three of you.
- Come on dude.

01:04:36.585 --> 01:04:39.588
Put your hands on
the back of your head.

01:04:39.654 --> 01:04:40.856
- Smoking one fucking...
- You too, on the left,

01:04:40.923 --> 01:04:42.491
- you too.
- Yeah.

01:04:45.727 --> 01:04:47.562
Officer look, it
was just a joint.

01:04:54.603 --> 01:04:55.905
No surprises there.

01:04:55.972 --> 01:04:57.140
Put your hands in back.

01:04:57.206 --> 01:05:01.810

01:05:01.878 --> 01:05:03.545

You got an ID?

01:05:38.513 --> 01:05:39.581

it's like you don't even exist.

01:05:56.232 --> 01:05:59.401
You're an absolute
non-person without an ID.

01:05:59.467 --> 01:06:03.805
You're just transients and
vagrants and bums, that's all.

01:06:03.872 --> 01:06:05.473
No goods.

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:07.409
You can't just

01:06:22.258 --> 01:06:23.825
You weren't
smoking when I came up to you?

01:06:23.893 --> 01:06:25.127
No sir, I was not.

01:06:25.194 --> 01:06:27.829

01:07:03.933 --> 01:07:05.600
Okay, here?

01:07:05.667 --> 01:07:07.236

Mrs. O'Connell said

01:07:07.303 --> 01:07:09.738
this is where she saw him.

01:07:09.804 --> 01:07:12.807
She said she was
sure it was Steven.

01:07:14.076 --> 01:07:16.811
It was a few months ago though.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.716
Excuse me.

01:07:21.783 --> 01:07:22.684

01:07:25.054 --> 01:07:27.756
I promise you we won't take
up too much of your time.

01:07:27.822 --> 01:07:30.625
You wouldn't happen to be
with the CIA now would ya?

01:07:30.692 --> 01:07:31.826
What, no, no.

01:07:32.929 --> 01:07:34.496
The Feds didn't send you?

01:07:34.562 --> 01:07:35.764
- No.
- Good.

01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:39.634
'Cause I've told 'em a
thousand times I'm retired,

01:07:39.701 --> 01:07:42.071
got my own life now you know.

01:07:42.138 --> 01:07:44.941
Bunch of bastard narcos,
they didn't send you?

01:07:45.007 --> 01:07:46.342
No.

01:07:46.409 --> 01:07:50.012
We're looking for a young man,
his name is Steven Bugsby,

01:07:50.079 --> 01:07:51.914
he's a little shorter than you,

01:07:51.981 --> 01:07:54.783
he's got long brown
hair, he's 21.

01:07:54.849 --> 01:07:55.817
He's our son.

01:07:57.153 --> 01:08:00.588
Yeah you see, that
could be a problem,

01:08:00.655 --> 01:08:03.658
I haven't eaten
anything all day.

01:08:03.725 --> 01:08:06.996
It reminds me of the
time I spent in Taiwan.

01:08:07.063 --> 01:08:11.666
Three weeks with nothing
to eat but rice cakes.

01:08:11.733 --> 01:08:13.668
When I get that hungry

01:08:13.735 --> 01:08:16.037
I have a tough time
remembering my own name

01:08:16.104 --> 01:08:18.673
let alone your sons.

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.774
Can't swing a meal,

01:08:20.841 --> 01:08:23.312
plus I'm saving my money.

01:08:23.379 --> 01:08:26.948
Flying out west
going to see my wife.

01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:28.783
She's in the films you know.

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:30.585
Yeah, here.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.622
I suddenly feel my
memories flooding back.

01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:38.827
What'd you say
your sons name was?

01:08:38.894 --> 01:08:39.560
Hey.

01:08:39.627 --> 01:08:41.897
Steve, hey, excuse me.

01:08:41.964 --> 01:08:44.866
I'll suck your
dick for 20 bucks.

01:08:44.934 --> 01:08:45.834
Steven.

01:08:45.901 --> 01:08:46.801
Steven?

01:08:46.868 --> 01:08:48.069
Steven Bugsby.

01:08:49.171 --> 01:08:51.006
Never heard of him.

01:08:55.911 --> 01:08:57.612
We do girls too.

01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:58.981
Please.

01:08:59.048 --> 01:09:00.648
Geez, just get me out of here.

01:09:00.715 --> 01:09:01.649
Okay, all right, all right.

01:09:01.716 --> 01:09:04.519
It'll be the
night of your life.

01:09:10.893 --> 01:09:12.660
I can't be here
again, no, no, not here,

01:09:12.727 --> 01:09:13.828
no, no, not here.

01:09:13.895 --> 01:09:15.729
Will you chill out,
just sit the fuck down.

01:09:15.796 --> 01:09:17.832
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:20.935
He took all the speed pills
back at the subway station.

01:09:21.002 --> 01:09:22.670
All of 'em?

01:09:22.737 --> 01:09:23.837
All of them.

01:09:24.974 --> 01:09:27.009
I wanna go
home, I wanna go home,

01:09:27.076 --> 01:09:29.711
I wanna go home,
I wanna go home,

01:09:29.778 --> 01:09:31.779
I wanna go home.

01:09:31.845 --> 01:09:34.884
All right, okay,
here's what we do.

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:36.718
We hot wire a car, all right.

01:09:36.785 --> 01:09:38.020
I saw a guy do it once,
seems pretty easy,

01:09:38.087 --> 01:09:39.388
you just gotta make sure
you don't set off the alarm

01:09:39.455 --> 01:09:40.721
when you get in the fucking car.

01:09:40.788 --> 01:09:41.856
You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

01:09:41.924 --> 01:09:42.657
All right, well I
don't see you coming up

01:09:42.724 --> 01:09:45.693
with any brilliant ideas.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.130
Look, why don't you
go seduce some John.

01:09:48.197 --> 01:09:49.064
Do the innocent

01:09:49.131 --> 01:09:50.166

01:09:50.232 --> 01:09:51.000

01:09:53.536 --> 01:09:54.669
- Shut the your fucking mouth.
- It's an easy way

01:09:54.736 --> 01:09:55.471
to make a quick buck and
you might even like it.

01:09:55.538 --> 01:09:56.205
Shut your fucking mouth.

01:09:59.707 --> 01:10:00.509
Shut up.

01:10:00.575 --> 01:10:01.210
It's shut, it's fucking shut.

01:10:01.277 --> 01:10:03.045
Where are you going?

01:10:05.981 --> 01:10:06.882

What the hell dude?

01:10:36.011 --> 01:10:37.446
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

01:10:37.513 --> 01:10:38.481
Yeah, oh fuck.

01:10:38.547 --> 01:10:40.715
I'm not gonna
use it, obviously,

01:10:40.782 --> 01:10:41.951
we're just gonna scare Eddie.

01:10:42.017 --> 01:10:43.152
- No.
- We're gonna get him

01:10:43.219 --> 01:10:43.852
to give us some cash so
we can get out of here.

01:10:43.919 --> 01:10:45.020
No you're not, no.

01:10:45.087 --> 01:10:48.023
I'm not gonna touch
him, Jenny, I promise,

01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:48.756
- I'm not gonna touch him.
- No.

01:10:48.823 --> 01:10:49.858
We'll be in and out.

01:10:49.925 --> 01:10:50.526
- This is a bad idea.
- We get the money

01:10:50.593 --> 01:10:52.194
and we disappear.

01:10:53.262 --> 01:10:55.464
Okay, but he needs
to see you there.

01:10:55.531 --> 01:10:56.532
Okay, you gotta
be in there, okay,

01:10:56.599 --> 01:10:59.468
he needs to see your
face, okay Jenny?

01:10:59.535 --> 01:11:01.203
Look, you gotta do
this for me, okay?

01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:02.770
It's gotta be the
three of us, all right?

01:11:02.837 --> 01:11:04.240
I need this, please?

01:11:07.176 --> 01:11:08.810
I love you, okay.

01:11:12.915 --> 01:11:14.116
Well say something.

01:11:14.183 --> 01:11:16.718
I don't, please, we,

01:11:16.784 --> 01:11:17.920
I don't think that you should...

01:11:17.987 --> 01:11:20.089
Fuck, fuck it,

01:11:20.156 --> 01:11:21.656
Go, what, no.

01:11:24.059 --> 01:11:25.060
Bug.

01:11:25.127 --> 01:11:26.162
I've got something for you,

01:11:26.228 --> 01:11:28.497
I've got something
for you too Eddie.

01:11:28.564 --> 01:11:31.000
Open up the fucking register.

01:11:31.066 --> 01:11:32.501
Don't just stand there

01:11:32.568 --> 01:11:34.069

01:11:41.076 --> 01:11:42.744

You got the cash, let's go.

01:11:43.979 --> 01:11:45.747
Open the fucking safe Eddie

01:11:45.813 --> 01:11:47.782

01:11:47.849 --> 01:11:48.750

01:11:50.286 --> 01:11:51.020
I can't.

01:11:51.086 --> 01:11:52.154
He doesn't have the key.

01:11:52.221 --> 01:11:55.157
I swear to god

01:11:55.224 --> 01:11:56.192

01:13:02.658 --> 01:13:04.026
I hate you.

01:13:04.093 --> 01:13:05.827
I didn't mean to.

01:13:07.029 --> 01:13:08.964
Dude, give me your fucking keys.

01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:10.165

01:17:52.548 --> 01:17:56.285
Besides, they put an extra
security guard on the wing.

01:17:56.351 --> 01:17:59.488
Seems excessive
for a stolen car.

01:17:59.555 --> 01:18:03.258

night do you remember?

01:18:03.325 --> 01:18:05.160
It was my birthday.

out of control?

01:18:09.398 --> 01:18:11.266
You could say that.

01:18:18.407 --> 01:18:20.342

01:18:24.346 --> 01:18:26.481
Dr. Flores please dial 118.

01:18:30.385 --> 01:18:33.088
That's my son, Steven Bugsby.

01:18:48.637 --> 01:18:50.172
Happy birthday.

01:18:53.241 --> 01:18:54.409
Thanks.

01:18:55.644 --> 01:18:56.511
How old?

01:18:58.647 --> 01:18:59.581
21.

01:19:02.818 --> 01:19:05.654
Hospital room
on your 21st huh?

01:19:07.756 --> 01:19:12.327
Yeah, it was not
suppose to happen this way.

01:19:15.297 --> 01:19:18.667
Life doesn't always
go the way we expect.

01:19:21.403 --> 01:19:22.704
Mrs. Bugsby?

01:19:22.771 --> 01:19:24.373
Yes.

01:19:24.439 --> 01:19:26.475
I'm your husbands nurse.

01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:27.509
How's he doing.

01:19:27.576 --> 01:19:30.245
He's fine, he's
in stable condition

01:19:30.312 --> 01:19:34.282
and we expect him to be
released today or tomorrow.

01:19:34.349 --> 01:19:35.484
Oh, thank god.

01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:36.752
How are you doing?

01:19:36.818 --> 01:19:38.654
I'm just fine.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.389
They ran a few
precautionary tests

01:19:40.455 --> 01:19:42.491
and I'm cleared to go.

01:19:42.557 --> 01:19:44.559
When can I see my Roger?

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.763
Is there anyone you can call,

01:19:47.829 --> 01:19:50.499
let 'em know you're all right?

01:19:50.565 --> 01:19:51.466
Friends?

01:19:55.071 --> 01:19:58.473
Last two friends
I had are gone.

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:00.475
Parents?

01:20:03.378 --> 01:20:06.314
I don't really
think they'd care.

01:20:09.818 --> 01:20:13.588
Parents always care
about their children.

01:20:17.659 --> 01:20:19.494
You got kids?

01:20:20.729 --> 01:20:21.630
A son.

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.301
What's he like?

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:32.274
Decent,
just doesn't know it.

01:20:46.122 --> 01:20:49.858
Mrs. Bugsby, you should
know that your husband

01:20:49.926 --> 01:20:52.327
is sharing a room
with the young man

01:20:52.394 --> 01:20:54.463
who was in the car that
collided with yours.

01:20:54.529 --> 01:20:57.432
Well I'm sure it
was just an accident.

01:20:57.499 --> 01:20:59.534
There's something else.

01:21:30.632 --> 01:21:31.901
Investigating
an armed robbery,

01:21:31.968 --> 01:21:35.604
not a case of shoplifting
like they initially thought.

01:21:38.975 --> 01:21:41.443
Oh, you fucking pussy.

01:21:42.811 --> 01:21:45.413
- Stop, cut it out.
- What?

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.481
- Stop.
- Okay.

01:21:46.548 --> 01:21:47.749
Just
under an hour ago

01:21:47.816 --> 01:21:49.118
with the neighborhood
market on Franklin street.

01:21:49.185 --> 01:21:52.387
Been told the store clerk has
been taken to the hospital

01:21:52.454 --> 01:21:53.755
with serious injuries.

01:21:53.822 --> 01:21:55.590
Three suspects ran...

01:22:04.733 --> 01:22:05.700
Oh.

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:16.511
Come on, get in.

01:22:16.578 --> 01:22:17.947
Get in.

01:22:18.014 --> 01:22:19.048
Shortly after
taking cash from the register,

01:22:19.115 --> 01:22:21.449
according to police,
two of the suspects

01:22:21.516 --> 01:22:23.552
then stole a parked car outside.

01:22:23.618 --> 01:22:26.956
One suspect is armed
and possibly dangerous.

01:22:27.023 --> 01:22:30.325
Yes, I want to
report a break in.

01:22:36.865 --> 01:22:38.234
Look at this huh.

01:22:38.301 --> 01:22:41.803
Oh, wouldn't wanna get a smack
off of that, would you, huh?

01:22:44.639 --> 01:22:48.410
I gotta piss, man,
where's the bathroom?

01:22:48.476 --> 01:22:49.678
Down the hall to the left.

01:22:49.744 --> 01:22:50.745

That's how long your

01:26:16.952 --> 01:26:19.922
Sat right over there

minute you'd be home.

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:28.630

Out with some friends.

01:26:50.252 --> 01:26:53.889
I was your age once,
believe it or not.

01:26:55.257 --> 01:26:56.758
Where were you?

01:26:58.894 --> 01:26:59.794
Went to the movies.

01:26:59.861 --> 01:27:01.063

01:27:10.206 --> 01:27:12.108
but suspended from school,

01:27:12.174 --> 01:27:16.912
and now your on probation, you
haven't slept here for days.

01:27:16.979 --> 01:27:20.182

01:27:30.758 --> 01:27:31.994
Go fuck yourself.

01:27:32.061 --> 01:27:34.829
You talk
like that to your father?

01:27:34.897 --> 01:27:37.199
No, 'cause I'm
gonna go to bed.

01:27:37.266 --> 01:27:39.969
Oh, you're not going anywhere.

01:27:40.035 --> 01:27:41.703

01:28:03.893 --> 01:28:05.793
Get out of my house.

01:28:07.795 --> 01:28:08.597
What?

01:28:08.663 --> 01:28:09.764
Get the fuck out of my house,

01:28:09.831 --> 01:28:11.833
you're not welcome here.

01:28:11.901 --> 01:28:13.169
Fine.

01:28:13.235 --> 01:28:14.637

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:28.277
Oh, that's a nice

01:30:07.116 --> 01:30:08.217
Give me the keys, I'm driving.

01:30:08.284 --> 01:30:09.285
You're fucking

Do you have any idea
how much shit we're in

01:30:15.457 --> 01:30:17.092
because of you?

01:30:18.994 --> 01:30:20.862
This can't be happening.

01:30:20.929 --> 01:30:22.164
- This isn't real.
- Come on, come on,

01:30:22.231 --> 01:30:23.032

01:30:58.100 --> 01:30:59.134
Me?

01:30:59.201 --> 01:31:01.370
Oh I know who I am,
I am a piece of shit,

01:31:01.437 --> 01:31:03.906
you, you're some whiny
little bitch crawling back

01:31:03.972 --> 01:31:05.307
to mommy and daddy.

01:31:05.374 --> 01:31:06.041
Yeah, well where are
you gonna be in a year, huh?

01:31:06.108 --> 01:31:07.376
What about five years?

01:31:07.443 --> 01:31:09.678
You wanna pick food out of
dumpsters your whole life?

01:31:09.745 --> 01:31:12.414
You wanna be a fuck
up all over again?

01:31:12.481 --> 01:31:14.216
You wanna die under
a fucking bridge?

01:31:14.283 --> 01:31:17.052
Says the guy who's tryna
fucking kill himself.

01:31:17.119 --> 01:31:19.421
No, no, no, no I wanna live.

01:31:21.490 --> 01:31:23.092
I wanna live.

01:31:23.158 --> 01:31:24.193
I wanna live.

01:31:33.268 --> 01:31:34.837
Roger wake up.

01:31:35.771 --> 01:31:36.871
Roger.

01:31:45.214 --> 01:31:46.715
911,
what's your emergency?

01:31:46.782 --> 01:31:49.351
We've been in a car accident.

01:31:53.255 --> 01:31:55.157
You can come in now.

01:31:57.192 --> 01:31:59.061
Do you need a moment?

01:32:00.195 --> 01:32:01.897
No, no I'm okay.

01:32:29.458 --> 01:32:31.059
It's okay.

01:33:02.257 --> 01:33:03.158
Mum?

01:33:16.271 --> 01:33:19.141
I'm sorry.

01:33:22.544 --> 01:33:23.979
I'm so sorry.

01:33:48.437 --> 01:33:50.205
So did you
get the book I sent you.

01:33:50.272 --> 01:33:51.240
Mm-hmm.

01:33:51.306 --> 01:33:52.374
How you liking it?

01:33:52.441 --> 01:33:55.544
Um, hard to say, I
just started it, so.

01:33:56.678 --> 01:33:59.581
So you're keeping busy then?

01:33:59.648 --> 01:34:04.152
I'm trying to, I mean,
some days get really long.

01:34:09.358 --> 01:34:11.560
How do you like your job?

01:34:12.628 --> 01:34:14.129
Not bad,
they got me working

01:34:14.196 --> 01:34:15.364
in the laundry room now.

01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:16.665
Good, that's good.

01:34:16.732 --> 01:34:19.401
It's important to stay
busy, stay out of your head.

01:34:19.468 --> 01:34:21.537
You taking your medication?

01:34:21.603 --> 01:34:23.238
- Yeah.
- Every day?

01:34:23.305 --> 01:34:24.306
Every day.

01:34:27.209 --> 01:34:29.311
So,
do you feel safe?

01:34:29.378 --> 01:34:31.113
Is anyone giving
you a hard time?

01:34:31.179 --> 01:34:34.550
No, mom,
it's not like that.

01:34:34.616 --> 01:34:36.251
So what
about your new cell mate,

01:34:36.318 --> 01:34:37.619
what's he like?

01:34:37.686 --> 01:34:42.658
I don't know, we
don't really talk that much.

01:34:44.192 --> 01:34:48.497
Well you should,
make friends.

01:34:50.265 --> 01:34:51.333
Wrap it up.

01:34:54.736 --> 01:34:56.438
Well you know you
can call us anytime,

01:34:56.505 --> 01:34:58.507
day or night, just call.

01:34:58.574 --> 01:35:00.375
Yeah, the guards
might object to that,

01:35:00.442 --> 01:35:02.277
but I'll tell 'em
you said it's okay.

01:35:02.344 --> 01:35:06.648
Oh, well thank you very
much, appreciate that.

01:35:06.715 --> 01:35:09.151
Happy birthday Steven.

01:35:09.217 --> 01:35:10.385
Thanks.

01:35:10.452 --> 01:35:12.421
You know we love
you very much?

01:35:12.487 --> 01:35:14.289
Love you guys too.

01:35:20.395 --> 01:35:23.365
Steven, we'll
be back next week.

01:35:30.439 --> 01:35:33.542
Eddie, I
hope you don't think

01:35:33.609 --> 01:35:36.378
I'm tryna justify what happened.

01:35:37.546 --> 01:35:38.513
I'm not.

01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:42.217
Things got so out
of control so fast.

01:35:43.485 --> 01:35:46.455
That night, that wasn't me,
I didn't recognize myself,

01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:50.592
like watching everything
unfold before my eyes,

01:35:50.659 --> 01:35:54.396
from a distance, from
somewhere else, helpless.

01:35:54.463 --> 01:35:57.232
In here I have so
much time to think,

01:35:57.299 --> 01:35:59.201
it's all I do.

01:35:59.267 --> 01:36:01.570
So many uncertainties,
so much unknown.

01:36:01.637 --> 01:36:04.373
I don't know anything
about you Eddie.

01:36:04.439 --> 01:36:05.474
Not really.

01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.576
And I fucking hate that.

01:36:07.643 --> 01:36:09.277
I hate that I hurt you.

01:36:09.344 --> 01:36:13.749
Some days I hate myself,
completely, to my core.

01:36:13.815 --> 01:36:17.753
You have every right to
share that sentiment.

01:36:17.819 --> 01:36:18.754
You should.

01:36:19.989 --> 01:36:22.357
Writing to you has helped
me get through this.

01:36:22.424 --> 01:36:24.626
This isn't an apology.

01:36:24.693 --> 01:36:26.795
I don't deserve to
ask you to forgive me,

01:36:26.862 --> 01:36:29.297
you got caught in the
crossfire of something

01:36:29.364 --> 01:36:33.301
that has simmering beneath
my skin my entire life.

01:36:33.368 --> 01:36:36.471
I guess I just want
you to understand.

01:36:38.306 --> 01:36:39.741
Thank you for this.

01:36:39.808 --> 01:36:41.710
Love you buddy.
