00:02.003 --> 00:04.119
Previously on Lost:

00:05.715 --> 00:07.000
Oh, God.

00:07.925 --> 00:10.541
It's not your fault she's dead.
It's mine.

00:10.636 --> 00:13.799
I convinced her to stay because
I didn't want to be alone.

00:14.724 --> 00:17.431
You can probably make it back
to the Temple by nightfall.

00:25.443 --> 00:27.308
I'm sorry you had to see me like that.

00:28.988 --> 00:29.977
Hello, Richard.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.573
- You?
- Me.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.363
I am very disappointed in all of you!

00:47.965 --> 00:50.798
So what were you doing in Australia?
Business or pleasure?

00:50.885 --> 00:53.843
- Actually, I went on a walkabout.
- Welcome to Los Ange/es.

00:58.935 --> 01:01.176
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, sweetie.

01:43.729 --> 01:44.889
Come on.

02:15.094 --> 02:16.504
John?

02:20.975 --> 02:23.432
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

02:24.437 --> 02:27.270
Come on, let's get you inside.

02:28.024 --> 02:29.230
OK.

02:30.568 --> 02:32.934
Well, how long will that take?

02:33.029 --> 02:35.486
The wedding is in October.

02:35.573 --> 02:38.565
Look, l'mjust gonna
have to call you back. Yeah.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.819
I am so sick of caterers

02:42.913 --> 02:47.577
and bands and picking fabrics
for chair backs.

02:49.337 --> 02:54.832
What do you say we just...
get my parents and your dad

02:54.925 --> 02:57.632
and do it shotgun style in Vegas?

02:57.720 --> 03:01.087
No. You deserve better than that, Helen.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.844
And we can do this. I know we can.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.267
I like...

03:09.940 --> 03:12.352
- ...this one.
- That one?

03:12.443 --> 03:17.062
- I meant this one.
- You are a very sweet man.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.905
I know.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.443
So how was the conference?

03:25.664 --> 03:27.120
Boﬁng.

03:29.919 --> 03:32.501
Who's Dr. Jack Shephard?

03:34.090 --> 03:37.002
I met him at Lost Luggage
when I went to fill out the forms.

03:37.093 --> 03:40.881
- He lost something, too.
- He's a spinal surgeon?

03:40.971 --> 03:44.884
Yeah. Nice guy.
He offered me a free consult.

03:44.975 --> 03:45.964
You should call him.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.353
- He was just being polite, Helen.
- So what?

03:52.441 --> 03:54.477
I mean...

03:54.568 --> 03:58.481
...what are the odds of you
just running into a spinal surgeon?

03:59.865 --> 04:03.699
I mean, who knows?
Maybe it's destiny.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.409
Maybe it is.

05:21.447 --> 05:22.937
All right, Richard.

05:24.909 --> 05:26.524
Time to talk.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.113
Welcome back, Colonel.

06:12.289 --> 06:15.577
Wow. You got a nice tan in Australia.

06:16.919 --> 06:19.160
- Did you miss us?
- Sure I did, Randy.

06:19.255 --> 06:21.712
So... how was the conference, John?

06:21.799 --> 06:24.211
It was OK.
I didn't really learn anything.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.632
- No?
- But...

06:25.719 --> 06:28.961
- ...I made some good contacts, though.
- Really? That's interesting.

06:29.056 --> 06:32.389
See, Ken Fisher called and said
you had to cancel your lunch with him.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.768
Right, right. I was a little
under the weather that day.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.305
- Probably jet lag.
- Really?

06:40.401 --> 06:43.814
The seminar people called and said
you hadn't picked up your credentials.

06:44.655 --> 06:48.648
I did some checking, and it seems
that you didn't attend a single event.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.404
Since we sent you to Sydney
on the company's dime...

06:52.204 --> 06:55.742
- ...where the hell were you?
- Look, Randy, I'm really sorry. I'm...

06:55.833 --> 06:58.245
Why don't we just call it
my vacation week?

06:58.335 --> 07:00.747
I thought you wanted that
vacation week in October?

07:00.838 --> 07:03.705
- You know, for your wedding.
- Please, Randy.

07:03.799 --> 07:07.007
I know I shouldn't have lied.
But where l was...

07:10.264 --> 07:13.176
lt's personal, and I really
don't want to talk about it.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.507
OK, John.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.309
Hey, you're fired.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.441
Thirsty?

07:36.915 --> 07:39.907
I'm sorry I hit you in the throat
and dragged you off the beach,

07:40.002 --> 07:42.118
- but I had to do something.
- What do you want?

07:43.547 --> 07:46.664
What I've always wanted,
for you to come with me.

07:48.344 --> 07:50.209
Why do you look like John Locke?

07:51.096 --> 07:55.590
I knew he'd get me access to Jacob.
Because John's a candidate.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.931
- Or at least he was a candidate.
- What do you mean...

08:01.857 --> 08:03.722
What do you mean, "a candidate?"

08:05.569 --> 08:08.982
- Didn't Jacob tell you any of this?
- Any of what?

08:09.073 --> 08:14.864
Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. You mean,
you've been doing everything he told you

08:19.416 --> 08:22.954
I would never have done that to you.
I would never have kept you in the dark.

08:23.045 --> 08:26.412
- And what would you have done?
- I would have treated you with respect.

08:29.093 --> 08:33.257
Come with me, and I promise
I'll tell you everything.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.766
- No.
- Are you sure about that, Richard?

08:41.146 --> 08:43.762
Because people seldom get
a second chance.

08:44.233 --> 08:46.440
I'm not going anywhere with you.

08:50.114 --> 08:52.070
All right...

09:01.250 --> 09:02.239
What?

09:08.507 --> 09:11.795
I'll be seeing you, Richard,
sooner than you think.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.029
Am I interrupting?

09:44.418 --> 09:46.158
Tell me what happened to them.

09:47.546 --> 09:51.880
All right. There's a fairly reasonable
chance that you won't believe me.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.555
Try me.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.433
John Locke killed them.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.186
- All by himself?
- Yes.

10:06.273 --> 10:11.393
He turned into a pillar of black smoke,
and he killed them right before my eyes.

10:11.487 --> 10:13.443
Did it kill Jacob as well?

10:15.699 --> 10:17.655
- Yes.
- Then where's his body?

10:18.702 --> 10:21.694
Locke kicked him into the fire,
and he burned away.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.923
Locke... Do you know why he carried
Richard out into the jungle?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.234
He's recruiting.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.162
Hello, James.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.177
I thought you were dead.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.801
I am.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.840
Here's to bein' dead.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.635
You're taking this extremely well.

12:49.478 --> 12:52.595
- Taking what extremely well?
- That I'm here.

12:52.689 --> 12:58.150
I don't give a damn if you're dead,
or time travelin' or...

12:58.236 --> 13:00.727
...the Ghost of Christmas Past.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.279
All I care about is this whiskey.

13:03.367 --> 13:08.612
So bottom's up,
and get the hell out of my house.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.167
This isn't your house, James.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.162
The hell it ain't.

13:19.257 --> 13:23.546
No. You just lived here for a while.
This was never your house.

13:27.891 --> 13:31.850
Who are you?
You sure as hell ain't John Locke.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.726
- What makes you say that?
- 'Cause Locke was scared...

13:37.734 --> 13:40.976
...even when he was
pretending he wasn't.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.652
But you...

13:45.534 --> 13:47.195
You ain't scared.

13:53.250 --> 13:57.368
What if I told you l was
the person who could answer

13:57.462 --> 13:59.794
the most important question
in the world?

14:07.764 --> 14:09.550
And what question is that?

14:11.268 --> 14:14.852
Why are you on this island?

14:14.938 --> 14:19.648
I'm on this island
because my plane crashed,

14:19.735 --> 14:21.726
'cause my raft blew up...

14:23.030 --> 14:26.193
Because the helicopter l was on
was ridin' one too heavy.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.114
That's not why you're here.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.451
And, if you come with me...

14:33.790 --> 14:35.121
...I can prove it.

14:41.757 --> 14:44.123
Well, I guess I better
put some pants on.

15:02.694 --> 15:05.356
OK. OK.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.239
Come on!

15:18.376 --> 15:19.912
Damn it!

15:26.843 --> 15:29.676
Dude? Dude!

15:34.142 --> 15:35.928
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

15:36.019 --> 15:37.350
What the hell are you doing?

15:37.437 --> 15:40.429
You ever park a car in your life?
You're practically in my spot!

15:40.524 --> 15:42.105
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.808
But, you know, there's
a handicap spot right over here.

15:44.903 --> 15:48.270
Yeah. Yeah, OK.
But I don't have to park there.

15:48.365 --> 15:52.779
I can park anywhere I want.
You need to stay inside the lines.

15:52.869 --> 15:56.157
I'm really sorry. They were
supposed to reserve a spot for me.

15:56.248 --> 15:59.456
So, you know, ljust parked here.

16:01.253 --> 16:03.710
I haven't seen you before.
You work here?

16:05.173 --> 16:07.380
Actually, I own the company.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.391
Hugo Reyes.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.717
John Locke.

16:19.688 --> 16:23.272
- Cool. What do you do here, John?
- Actually, nothing.

16:23.358 --> 16:26.350
- My boss just fired me.
- Who's your boss?

16:26.444 --> 16:28.435
His name is Randy.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.191
- But...
- Randy Nations?

16:30.282 --> 16:34.070
- Yes.
- Yeah, that guy is a huge douche.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.119
- You want me to talk to him for ya?
- No, that's OK.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.580
| tell you what, John.

16:41.418 --> 16:45.002
I own a temp agency, too.
Call this number

16:46.381 --> 16:52.092
and tell 'em that Hugo said to
hook you up with a new job pronto.

16:54.639 --> 16:58.131
And chin up.
Things are gonna work out.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.439
He's gettin' pretty ripe.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.865
- Where is everybody?
- They left.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.365
They were going to the Temple.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.869
Right now it's the safest place
on the island.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.042
- We should go there, too.
- Are you all right?

17:30.175 --> 17:31.460
I'm fine.

17:34.054 --> 17:37.262
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- What makes you think that I'm going?

17:37.682 --> 17:40.674
Because you want to find Jin.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.886
What do you know about my husband?

17:44.481 --> 17:50.147
I know that if he's on the island and
he's alive, then he'll be at the Temple.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.776
Let's get moving.

17:57.786 --> 17:58.821
What about John?

18:01.539 --> 18:02.949
We need to bury him.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.048
What were you doing
alone in that house, James?

18:14.135 --> 18:16.968
- Drinkin'.
- Where are the rest of your friends?

18:17.055 --> 18:21.094
- Some temple somewhere.
- Why aren't you with 'em?

18:21.184 --> 18:23.675
You know what?
How about we just don't talk?

18:24.938 --> 18:26.599
You got it.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.307
Who the hell is that?

18:32.988 --> 18:35.445
- You can see him?
- The kid? Hell, yeah, I can see him.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.861
- Hey!
- What...

19:01.641 --> 19:05.179
You know the rules.
You can't kill him.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.355
Don't tell me what I can't do.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.901
Don't tell me what I can't do!

19:29.085 --> 19:30.586
Locke!

19:32.630 --> 19:34.131
Locke!

19:37.093 --> 19:41.006
Look, whoever you are, you got about
20 seconds, and then I'm outta here!

19:45.810 --> 19:47.971
- Where is he?
- What the hell are you doing here?

19:48.063 --> 19:49.803
- Where is he?
- Locke?

19:49.898 --> 19:51.729
Ran off into the jungle after some kid.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.397
- We need to go now.
- Go where?

19:53.485 --> 19:55.817
- To the Temple. Let's go. Let's go.
- You know what?

19:55.904 --> 19:58.020
I've been to the Temple.
I'm sticking with Locke.

19:58.114 --> 20:01.197
- That man is not John Locke.
- I know.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.741
- Then why are you with him?
- Because he's got answers,

20:03.828 --> 20:06.865
says he knows why I'm on this island.
Unless you wanna tell me why.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.333
He's not gonna tell you anything.
He's gonna kill you.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.874
If he wanted to kill me,
he could've done it already.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.543
You don't understand what you're dealing
with. He doesn't just want you dead.

20:14.631 --> 20:18.044
He wants everyone dead, everyone
you care about, and he won't stop...

20:26.810 --> 20:30.143
- Who you talking to?
- Nobody.

20:31.106 --> 20:34.098
- You ever catch up with the kid?
- What kid?

20:36.486 --> 20:37.896
Right.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.603
- Let's get on with it, shall we?
- Yes, James.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.739
Let's get on with it.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.989
What kind of animal
would you describe yourself as?

20:53.378 --> 20:55.994
- Excuse me?
- What kind of animal

20:56.089 --> 20:58.000
would you describe yourself as?

21:00.385 --> 21:03.673
- Don't know what that has to do with...
- Just say whatever comes to mind.

21:07.100 --> 21:10.308
Would you describe yourself
as a people person?

21:13.398 --> 21:15.263
May I speak to your supervisor?

21:17.485 --> 21:20.898
Of course. I'll go get her.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.450
- Good morning, Mr. Locke?
- Yeah.

21:31.541 --> 21:34.658
l'm Rose Nadler,
the office supervisor.

21:34.752 --> 21:37.789
- What can I do for you?
- What you can do, Ms. Nadler,

21:37.881 --> 21:41.214
is spare me the questions
about what kind of animal I am,

21:41.301 --> 21:44.839
- and hopefully place me in a job.
- Absolutely.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.090
What kind of placement
are you looking for?

21:47.182 --> 21:50.299
Well, | see here that you have
a listing for a site coordinator.

21:50.393 --> 21:54.978
Construction site coordinator.
I'm not sure that's a good match.

21:55.064 --> 21:58.477
- lf experience is the issue, l have...
- Experience isn't the issue.

22:00.028 --> 22:03.941
Look, Mr. Reyes told me,

22:04.032 --> 22:06.148
ifl came down here,
I would be taken care of.

22:06.242 --> 22:09.200
And Mr. Reyes is my boss,
so if he said that,

22:09.287 --> 22:13.701
I can make it happen for you. If you
want to work construction, you got it.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.282
- Thank you.
- I'm not finished.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.163
I will send you down there tomorrow,

22:18.254 --> 22:22.748
and then the day after,
you will be back in my office.

22:24.552 --> 22:30.343
Look... Mr. Locke,
let's try to be a little more realistic.

22:30.433 --> 22:33.516
And what do you know about realistic?

22:38.399 --> 22:42.267
l have cancer. Terminal cancer.

22:44.489 --> 22:45.729
I'm sorry.

22:45.823 --> 22:50.283
When the doctors first told me,
I had a hard time accepting it.

22:51.621 --> 22:55.364
But, eventually,
I got past the denial part,

22:55.458 --> 23:00.293
and I got back to living
whatever life I've got left.

23:02.173 --> 23:08.043
So... How about
we find you a job you can do?

23:15.645 --> 23:18.307
- Do you read?
- Excuse me?

23:18.731 --> 23:22.315
- Books. You read books?
- Sure. Who doesn't?

23:23.736 --> 23:27.399
My favorite's Steinbeck,
Of Mice and Men.

23:27.490 --> 23:31.654
- You know that one?
- Nope. A little after my time.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.284
It's about these two guys,
George and Lennie.

23:38.334 --> 23:42.452
Lennie's kind of slow,
causing George problems.

23:43.464 --> 23:47.958
So George walks him out in the woods,
tells him to look out yonder and picture

23:48.052 --> 23:51.169
the pretty little house
they're gonna live in one day.

23:51.264 --> 23:53.721
And he shoots Lennie
in the back of the head.

23:53.808 --> 23:56.015
Well, that doesn't sound
like a happy ending.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.509
It ain't.

24:04.027 --> 24:05.312
What's on your mind, James?

24:05.403 --> 24:08.315
I'm wondering what'd happen to you
if I put a bullet in your head.

24:10.575 --> 24:12.156
Why don't we find out?

24:17.999 --> 24:18.988
What are you?

24:21.711 --> 24:24.202
What I am is trapped.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.455
And I've been trapped for so long

24:27.550 --> 24:30.337
that I don't even remember
what it feels like to be free.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.889
Maybe you can understand that.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.474
But before I was trapped,
l was a man, James, just like you.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.260
l have a hard time believing that.

24:41.356 --> 24:44.189
You can believe whatever you want,
but that's the truth.

24:45.068 --> 24:51.029
I know what it's like to feel joy,
to feel pain, anger, fear...

24:51.908 --> 24:53.648
To experience betrayal.

24:54.911 --> 24:57.323
I know what it's like
to lose someone you love.

25:02.377 --> 25:07.087
If you wanna shoot me, shoot me.
But you're so close, James.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.087
It would be such a shame
to turn back now.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.861
Why did you have to bring him
to the statue in the first place?

25:39.956 --> 25:43.119
Because the people there need to see
the face of what they're up against.

25:43.209 --> 25:47.202
And what's to stop what they're
up against from changing his face?

25:47.296 --> 25:49.332
He can't. Not anymore.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.506
He's stuck this way.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.014
Does anyone want to say anything?

26:47.982 --> 26:49.518
Didn't any of you know him?

26:54.447 --> 26:56.108
All right, I knew him.

27:00.995 --> 27:02.986
John Locke was a...

27:10.713 --> 27:13.455
...a believer.
He was a man of faith.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.050
He was...

27:16.260 --> 27:17.841
...a much better man...

27:19.764 --> 27:21.379
...than I will ever be.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.350
And I'm very sorry I murdered him.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.242
This is the weirdest damn funeral
I've ever been to.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.671
Hello. Dr. Shepherd's office.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.750
Hello? Can / help you?

28:41.846 --> 28:44.007
No. No, you can't.

28:45.725 --> 28:49.183
- Who was that on the phone?
- No one.

28:49.270 --> 28:53.388
No one? John, | just
heard you talking on the phone.

28:55.902 --> 28:59.486
l was... I was calling Dr. Shephard.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.692
Well, good for you.
When are you gonna see him?

29:06.787 --> 29:08.197
I'm not gonna see him.

29:09.332 --> 29:11.573
Well, I don't understand.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.749
- Why wouldn't you...
- I got fired, Helen.

29:20.176 --> 29:21.962
Coming!

29:22.637 --> 29:24.593
Ma'am? Oceanic courier.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.630
l'm delivering your lost luggage.

29:27.725 --> 29:28.714
All right.

29:31.062 --> 29:32.973
Sign here to accept the delivery.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.524
- Thanks.
- OK, thanks.

29:47.578 --> 29:48.863
OK, John.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.791
Now talk to me.

29:54.043 --> 29:55.874
How did you get fired?

29:58.673 --> 30:02.257
I lied to Randy. I didn't go
to the conference in Sydney.

30:03.803 --> 30:04.883
What?

30:06.555 --> 30:07.806
Open the case, Helen.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.032
What are these for?

30:38.337 --> 30:40.828
- My walkabout.
- Your what?

30:40.923 --> 30:43.460
My walkabout.

30:43.551 --> 30:47.635
An adventure in the outback,
man against nature.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.546
But they wouldn't let me go.

30:51.851 --> 30:55.014
And | sat there yelling at them,
shouting at them,

30:55.104 --> 30:57.686
that they couldn't tell me
what I can't do.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.223
But they were right.

31:06.532 --> 31:11.242
I'm sick of imagining what my life
could be out of this chair, Helen.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.943
What it would be like to...

31:14.415 --> 31:19.205
...walk down the aisle with you,
'cause it's not gonna happen.

31:23.299 --> 31:26.541
So if you need me to see
more doctors, if...

31:26.635 --> 31:29.377
Have more consults, if you need me
to get out of this chair,

31:29.472 --> 31:30.962
I don't blame you.

31:31.807 --> 31:35.049
But I don't want you to spend your life
waiting for a miracle, Helen,

31:35.144 --> 31:39.478
because... there is no such thing.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.236
There are miracles, John.

31:58.334 --> 32:00.450
And the only thing...

32:02.296 --> 32:04.503
...l was ever waiting for...

32:07.510 --> 32:08.625
...was you.

32:38.791 --> 32:41.954
Nice view. Now what?

32:43.379 --> 32:44.915
Now we go down.

32:47.216 --> 32:48.706
Down where?

32:50.219 --> 32:51.550
Down there.

32:53.931 --> 32:56.343
No offense, but you already died,

32:56.433 --> 32:59.049
so it's great that this is
not a big deal for you.

32:59.145 --> 33:02.603
But if you think I'm climbin' down there
first, you are off your damn nut.

33:02.690 --> 33:04.180
It's no problem. I'll go first.

33:22.543 --> 33:23.749
You comin', James?

34:10.507 --> 34:12.338
James!

34:14.011 --> 34:15.467
Locke!

34:18.933 --> 34:20.514
Jump. I got you. Come on!

34:21.644 --> 34:23.180
Come on, I got you! Come on!

34:23.979 --> 34:25.435
Come on!

34:26.398 --> 34:27.387
Come on!

35:07.690 --> 35:09.772
What is this place?

35:32.339 --> 35:35.581
- What the hell's that all about?
- lnside joke.

35:36.719 --> 35:39.176
So this is what you wanted me to see?

35:39.263 --> 35:42.175
A hole in the cliff
with some rocks on a scale?

35:42.266 --> 35:44.006
That's why I'm here?

35:47.771 --> 35:48.760
No.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.947
That's why you're here.

36:10.502 --> 36:14.415
That, James, is why you're all here.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.815
All right, dig it out.
Come on. All the way.

36:34.902 --> 36:38.611
No cheatin'. Come on, now.
Come on, all the way.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.484
You can catch 'em. You can catch 'em.
Come on, dig it out.

36:43.952 --> 36:45.783
Bring it in now.
Bring it in all the way.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.790
Good job. Good job.

36:53.796 --> 36:55.832
All right, everyone!

36:56.673 --> 36:59.255
Please open your textbooks
to chapter four.

36:59.343 --> 37:04.679
Today we are going to talk about...
the human reproductive system.

37:10.646 --> 37:14.559
Do you know where... Excuse me. Can you
tell me where the teachers' lounge is?

37:14.650 --> 37:16.641
- Yeah, it's over there.
- Thank you.

37:21.365 --> 37:23.276
All right, I know I sound like
a broken record,

37:23.367 --> 37:25.608
but how many times
do we have to go over this?

37:25.702 --> 37:28.489
If you have the last cup of coffee,

37:28.580 --> 37:33.244
you remove the filter and throw it away.

37:33.335 --> 37:35.792
Fear not. I will make a fresh pot.

37:35.879 --> 37:38.461
Actually, I was just hoping
for some Earl Grey.

37:38.549 --> 37:42.007
Tea? Now there's a gentleman's drink.

37:43.303 --> 37:46.045
I don't believe we've met.
Ben Linus. European history.

37:46.140 --> 37:49.257
- John Locke. Substitute.
- Well, welcome.

38:05.033 --> 38:08.571
- Who wrote all this?
- His name was Jacob.

38:10.122 --> 38:11.532
"Was" Jacob?

38:13.125 --> 38:15.161
He died yesterday.

38:21.467 --> 38:25.380
- You don't seem too upset about it.
- I'm not.

38:28.807 --> 38:33.016
- Why are all the names crossed out?
- They're not all crossed out.

38:34.396 --> 38:36.057
"Shephard."

38:38.400 --> 38:40.015
That'd be Jack Shephard?

38:48.494 --> 38:49.904
And he's not the only one.

38:56.043 --> 38:58.204
"Reyes." That's Hugo, right?

39:01.757 --> 39:04.920
- What's the eight about?
- Jacob had a thing for numbers.

39:07.054 --> 39:08.510
"Sixteen. Jarrah."

39:13.185 --> 39:16.894
"Forty-two. Kwon." I don't know
if it's Sun or if it's Jin.

39:21.151 --> 39:22.891
Here.

39:24.571 --> 39:25.856
"Four. Locke."

39:26.573 --> 39:28.609
I think we both know him.

39:35.249 --> 39:36.830
Last, but not least...

39:39.628 --> 39:41.914
"Number 15. Ford."

39:45.175 --> 39:48.838
- That would be you.
- Why'd he write my name on this wall?

39:48.929 --> 39:51.841
- I never even met the guy.
- I'm sure you did meet Jacob.

39:58.063 --> 40:01.100
At some point in your life, James,
probably when you were young,

40:01.191 --> 40:05.059
when you were miserable
and vulnerable, he came to you.

40:05.153 --> 40:09.271
He manipulated you, pulled your strings
like you were a puppet.

40:09.366 --> 40:12.278
And, as a result,
choices that you thought you made

40:12.369 --> 40:14.234
were never really choices at all.

40:15.998 --> 40:17.408
He was pushing you, James.

40:18.417 --> 40:19.577
Pushing you...

40:20.919 --> 40:22.500
...to the island.

40:25.132 --> 40:29.592
- Why the hell would he do that?
- Because you're a candidate.

40:29.678 --> 40:31.293
Candidate for what?

40:32.389 --> 40:34.675
He thought he was
the protector of this place.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.098
And you, James, have been nominated...

40:38.228 --> 40:41.265
- ...to take over that job.
- What does that mean?

40:41.356 --> 40:43.847
It means you've got three choices.

40:43.942 --> 40:47.685
First, you can do nothing, and...

40:49.323 --> 40:51.029
...see how all this plays out.

40:53.368 --> 40:56.906
And possibly, your name...

40:56.997 --> 40:59.158
...will get crossed out.

41:02.252 --> 41:05.915
Second option, you can accept the job,

41:06.006 --> 41:09.794
become the new Jacob
and protect the island.

41:09.885 --> 41:13.093
- Protect it from what?
- From nothing, James.

41:13.930 --> 41:17.013
That's the joke.
There's nothing to protect it from.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.715
It's just a damn island.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.306
And it will be perfectly fine
without Jacob or you,

41:22.397 --> 41:27.482
or any of the other people
whose lives he wasted.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.567
You said there were three choices.

41:34.701 --> 41:37.078
The third choice, James,
is that we just go.

41:38.747 --> 41:43.616
We just get the hell off this island,
and we never look back.

41:45.379 --> 41:47.085
And how do we do that?

41:49.257 --> 41:50.542
Together.

42:00.435 --> 42:02.426
So what do you say, James?

42:04.523 --> 42:06.263
Are you ready to go home?

42:16.118 --> 42:17.699
Hell, yes.
