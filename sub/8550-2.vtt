00:15.849 --> 00:17.885
MMM...ST. THOMAS.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.887
LOOK AT THOSE BEACHES.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.555
LOOK AT
THOSE SUNSETS.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.024
LOOK AT THOSE MEN.

00:25.593 --> 00:28.028
LOOK AT THAT BUFFET.

00:29.563 --> 00:32.466
ARE YOU SURE WE CAN
AFFORD THIS TRIP?

00:32.533 --> 00:36.470
NO, BUT SOMETIMES YOU
JUST HAVE TO GO FOR IT.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.640
AS LONG AS THERE ARE
NO UNEXPECTED EXPENSES,

00:39.707 --> 00:42.042
WE ARE ON OUR WAY.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.146
[THUNDER]

00:52.786 --> 00:54.155
OH!

00:56.324 --> 00:57.425
OH.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.068
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

01:08.136 --> 01:09.870
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

01:09.937 --> 01:13.241
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

01:13.307 --> 01:16.844
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

01:16.910 --> 01:21.549
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

01:21.615 --> 01:24.552
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:24.618 --> 01:28.856
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

01:28.922 --> 01:31.759
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

01:31.825 --> 01:36.264
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

01:37.265 --> 01:40.734
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:40.801 --> 01:44.738
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:44.805 --> 01:47.508
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

01:47.575 --> 01:51.479
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER
THE BLUES WITH TENDERNESS *

01:51.545 --> 01:54.882
* WHEN DAYS GO BY *

01:54.948 --> 01:58.252
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU,
THERE'S ROOM FOR ME *

01:58.319 --> 02:02.823
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

02:02.890 --> 02:05.759
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:05.826 --> 02:12.333
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

02:26.514 --> 02:30.017
WELL, IT'S GOING TO COST
A FORTUNE TO FIX THE ROOF.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.752
WE'LL HAVE TO CANCEL
OUR VACATION.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.887
NO. NO, NOT CANCEL.

02:33.954 --> 02:34.922
POSTPONE.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.690
I'LL FIX
THE ROOF MYSELF.

02:36.757 --> 02:42.230
AND I'LL BUY
A SPARKLY GOWN
AND OPEN FOR DIANA ROSS.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.237
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

02:49.303 --> 02:51.171
I'M SAYING
IT'S A NICE IDEA

02:51.239 --> 02:52.440
YOU WANNA
FIX THE ROOF,

02:52.506 --> 02:55.509
BUT YOU JUST CAN'T DO IT.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.546
AND WHY NOT,
IF YOU PLEASE?

02:58.612 --> 03:01.081
REMEMBER THAT BATHROOM
YOU PUT IN FOR YOUR MOTHER?

03:01.148 --> 03:02.516
YES.

03:02.583 --> 03:06.320
YOU RAN THE GAS LINE
INTO THE TOILET.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.355
FIRST TIME SHE FLUSHED,

03:07.421 --> 03:09.890
IT BLEW HER
INTO THE BASEMENT.

03:15.663 --> 03:20.801
WELL, THERE YOU
GO AGAIN, HARRIETTE.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.238
YOU KNOW, WHENEVER
I TRY TO FIX SOMETHING,

03:24.305 --> 03:27.341
DO I EVER HEAR,
"GO FOR IT, CARL,"

03:27.408 --> 03:29.310
"YOU CAN DO IT, CARL,"

03:29.377 --> 03:32.079
"I'M BEHIND YOU, CARL"?

03:32.145 --> 03:33.281
NO.

03:33.347 --> 03:37.184
YOU GIVE ME,
"YOU'LL BE SORRY, CARL,"

03:37.251 --> 03:39.587
"HIRE A PROFESSIONAL,
CARL,"

03:39.653 --> 03:42.890
"YOU BLEW YOUR MOTHER
INTO THE BASEMENT, CARL."

03:44.191 --> 03:47.361
WELL, I'M GOING TO
FIX THE ROOF, HARRIETTE.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.197
AND I'M GOING TO
FIX IT SO WELL

03:50.264 --> 03:51.599
THAT ALL OF OUR NEIGHBORS

03:51.665 --> 03:54.702
WILL COME
JUST TO LOOK AT IT,

03:54.768 --> 03:58.706
AND THEY'LL OOH AND AHH
AND APPLAUD MY WORK.

04:00.308 --> 04:03.210
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'LL
SAY TO ME THEN?

04:03.277 --> 04:07.581
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'LL SAY, HARRIETTE?

04:07.648 --> 04:08.482
SURE.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.785
"WAKE UP, YOU'RE
DREAMING, CARL."

04:14.455 --> 04:18.225
OH, HO HO HO, THAT'S
SO AMUSING, HARRIETTE.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.694
THAT'S HYSTERICAL,
HARRIETTE.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.697
THE ONLY THING FUNNIER
IS YOUR COOKING.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.274
LAURA, TELL ME AGAIN.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.377
WHAT WERE ALEX'S
EXACT WORDS?

04:36.444 --> 04:38.879
I'VE TOLD YOU
FIVE TIMES.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.381
WELL, TELL ME AGAIN.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.283
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER,
I HAVE NO LIFE.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.191
ALEX GOES...

04:51.258 --> 04:54.828
"LAURA, DO YOU WANT TO
STUDY TOGETHER?"

04:54.895 --> 04:56.464
AAH!
AAH!

04:58.298 --> 05:02.302
ALEX PHILLIPS
IS SO CUTE.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.674
AND WHAT A GREAT BOD.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.108
OOH.
OOH.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.877
OHH.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.948
STEVE, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?

05:15.015 --> 05:17.518
LONG ENOUGH FOR
YOUR HIGH-PITCHED
SQUEALS OF LUST

05:17.585 --> 05:20.721
TO SHATTER MY HEART.

05:22.590 --> 05:25.325
LAURA, TO EVEN HEAR YOU
SPEAK OF ANOTHER MAN

05:25.393 --> 05:28.429
IS LIKE AN ARROW
PIERCING ME.

05:28.496 --> 05:32.700
"ALEX IS SO CUTE."

05:33.300 --> 05:34.802
PSSS...

05:34.868 --> 05:36.737
OHH.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.708
"WHAT A GREAT BOD."

05:40.774 --> 05:42.843
PSSS...

05:42.910 --> 05:44.912
OHH.

05:45.613 --> 05:46.814
WANT TO FINISH ME OFF?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.583
JUST SAY YOU'D LIKE
TO KISS HIM.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.285
WOW, THAT'D BE GREAT.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.555
PSSS...

05:54.622 --> 05:55.723
OOH.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.495
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO WEAR?

06:01.562 --> 06:02.696
MAYBE THE GREEN BLOUSE

06:02.763 --> 06:04.432
WITH THE SHORT
BLACK SKIRT.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.733
WHAT SHOES?

06:05.799 --> 06:07.801
I DON'T KNOW.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.697
OH...WOW.

06:36.764 --> 06:40.000
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S
REALLY HIGH UP HERE.

06:42.503 --> 06:46.640
I DIDN'T REALIZE I HAD
SUCH A TALL HOUSE.

06:46.707 --> 06:50.210
YOU NEED IT BECAUSE
YOU'VE GOT A TALL SON.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.212
AAH! OH, NO!
OH, OH!

06:52.279 --> 06:54.515
OH, OH!
OH, OH, OH!

06:57.150 --> 06:58.118
SON?

06:58.185 --> 06:59.587
YES, DAD?

06:59.653 --> 07:01.121
YOU DO THAT AGAIN,

07:01.188 --> 07:03.757
AND I'M TAKING YOU
WITH ME.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.860
RIGHT, DAD.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.596
OKAY. ALRIGHT.

07:11.198 --> 07:14.868
YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T
BELIEVE THAT I CAN
FIX A ROOF.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.938
YOU AND I
ARE GOING TO
PROVE HER WRONG.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.641
WHY DO I ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE INVOLVED?

07:20.708 --> 07:22.510
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
PROVE MOM WRONG?

07:22.576 --> 07:24.277
BECAUSE I WANT
YOU AND I

07:24.344 --> 07:28.448
TO SPEND SOME
QUALITY TIME TOGETHER.

07:28.516 --> 07:31.819
IS IT THAT
OR BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT PAYING ME?

07:31.885 --> 07:34.888
WELL, THAT'S WHAT MAKES
THE TIME QUALITY.

07:43.731 --> 07:48.468
THAT'S PRETTY SMART,
HOW YOU GOT THAT
TOOLBOX UP HERE.

07:48.536 --> 07:51.872
WELL, I LEARNED TO TIE
THIS ROPE TO THE BOX

07:51.939 --> 07:55.643
BY WATCHING
THIS PROGRAM,
THIS OLD HOUSE.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.179
[CRASH]

08:08.789 --> 08:10.724
WE'LL USE
THAT STUFF TOMORROW.

08:13.827 --> 08:18.198
RIGHT NOW,
IT'S TIME TO PLAY
"LOOK FOR THE LEAK."

08:19.900 --> 08:24.738
BECAUSE IF
WE CAN'T FIND IT,
WE CAN'T FIX IT.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.541
MOST LEAKS IN YOUR ROOF

08:27.608 --> 08:29.977
ARE CAUSED BY
SOFT SPOTS.

08:30.043 --> 08:34.081
SEE, SO YOU HAVE TO
PROBE VERY CAUTIOUSLY,

08:34.147 --> 08:35.883
VERY CAREFULLY.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.652
SEE, BECAUSE OTHERWISE,
A SMALL HOLE--

08:51.899 --> 08:54.167
HOW'S IT GOING UP THERE?

08:55.636 --> 08:57.504
PRETTY GOOD.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.206
WE FOUND THE LEAK.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.024
THANKS FOR HELPING ME
FIND THE GYM.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.226
DON'T FEEL BAD,
IT'S MONDAY.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.229
YOU HAD TWO WHOLE DAYS
TO FORGET WHERE IT WAS.

09:29.937 --> 09:30.838

09:30.904 --> 09:33.440
A MOMENT
OF YOUR TIME, PLEASE.

09:33.506 --> 09:36.543
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
JERKEL?

09:36.610 --> 09:38.779
I WON'T BE DRAWN
INTO A BATTLE OF WITS.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.682
AFTER ALL,
YOU'RE UNARMED.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.855
I MERELY WISH TO ISSUE
A FRIENDLY WARNING--

09:47.921 --> 09:50.123
STAY AWAY FROM MY LAURA.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.392
HI, ALEX.

09:52.459 --> 09:53.927
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.062
HI, MAX.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.304
[WHISTLE BLOWS]

10:04.371 --> 10:05.505
ALRIGHT, LISTEN UP.

10:05.572 --> 10:08.341
TODAY, WE GOT
YOUR FAVORITE AND MINE--

10:08.408 --> 10:09.677
THE ROPE CLIMB.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.112
AW...
AW....

10:12.179 --> 10:13.446
OH, NO.

10:13.513 --> 10:16.349
OF ALL DAYS
WHEN LAURA'S WATCHING.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.818
SO?

10:17.885 --> 10:20.620
SO, I HATE
THE ROPE CLIMB.

10:20.688 --> 10:24.224
NO MATTER
HOW HARD I TRY,
I CAN'T DO IT.

10:24.291 --> 10:28.495
I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM
WITH MR. POTATO HEAD.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.631
ALRIGHT, PHILLIPS,
YOU GET TO GO FIRST.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.870
I'LL ONLY GO
HALF SPEED.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.139
I MEAN, WE DON'T WANT
LAURA TO FAINT.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.510
GO!

10:43.576 --> 10:46.179
GO, ALEX!
COME ON, ALEX!

10:46.246 --> 10:48.115

10:48.181 --> 10:49.783
YEAH!

10:51.051 --> 10:52.419

10:52.485 --> 10:54.688
NICE WORK.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.590
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:57.657 --> 10:58.992
HOPING HE WON'T
CALL ME.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.929
HE WON'T.
COACH REDDING
IS A KIND MAN.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.596
HE'S SENSITIVE,
AND HE'S CARING.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.399

ALMOST THERE.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.466
IT'S OKAY.
YOU TRIED.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.735
WE CAN DO IT.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.239
YOU CAN STOP NOW.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.574
COME ON.
NO.

11:47.640 --> 11:48.708
NO.

11:48.776 --> 11:49.743

11:53.847 --> 11:56.283

NO HANDS ON ROPE.

11:57.184 --> 12:00.220

12:06.760 --> 12:09.162
ALRIGHT, LADIES,

12:17.337 --> 12:18.571
THANKS, URKEL.

12:18.638 --> 12:19.807
I MEAN, I'M GOOD,

12:19.873 --> 12:22.075
BUT YOU MAKE ME
LOOK GREAT.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.779
OH, CAN IT, PHILLIPS!

12:25.846 --> 12:28.181
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN
THE BETTER MAN TODAY,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.150
BUT YOU HEAR ME

12:30.217 --> 12:31.084
IN A FORTNIGHT,

12:31.151 --> 12:34.054
NOT ONLY WILL
I MAKE IT TO THE TOP,

12:34.121 --> 12:36.723
BUT I'LL DO IT
FASTER THAN YOU.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.492
PUT YOUR MONEY
WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.229
DON'T DO IT, URKEL.
MONEY HAS GERMS ON IT.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.604
FORGET MONEY.

12:51.671 --> 12:54.274
I PREFER HIGHER STAKES.

STRAIN THESE PUPPIES.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.590
STEVE, YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.093

OH, LAURA.

13:55.702 --> 13:57.570
I HURT SO BAD.

13:57.637 --> 13:58.705
I HURT IN PLACES

13:58.771 --> 14:01.408
THAT I NEED
THREE MIRRORS TO SEE.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.883
WOULD YOU GIVE ME
A BACK RUB?

14:11.151 --> 14:14.454
OKAY, BUT ONLY
TILL I GET NAUSEOUS.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.123
OH, THANKS.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.126
OH.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.895
AH.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.332
OHH.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.902
I'M GOING TO STOP
IF YOU KEEP MAKING
THOSE NOISES.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.438
OKAY. I'LL MAKE THEM
SILENTLY.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.580
I DON'T WANT
TO SEE IT, EITHER.

14:40.647 --> 14:41.915
OH, SORRY.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.321
YOU KNOW WHAT,
LAURA?

14:48.388 --> 14:51.925
I REALIZE
YOU DON'T LOVE ME
BECAUSE I'M WEAK.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.260
STEVE, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.127
IT ISN'T?

14:54.194 --> 14:56.163
NO. THERE'S
LOTS OF REASONS

14:56.229 --> 14:58.431
WHY I DON'T LOVE YOU.

14:59.967 --> 15:02.502
REALLY? WELL,
NAME A COUPLE.

15:02.569 --> 15:08.942
WELL, YOU'RE STUBBORN,
IRRITATING, LOUD,
OBNOXIOUS, PUSHY, CLUMSY--

15:09.009 --> 15:11.478
I SAID A COUPLE.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.017
WELL, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU DO LIKE ABOUT ME?

15:17.084 --> 15:20.320
WELL, YOU'RE INTELLIGENT.
I LIKE THAT.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.156
IN FACT, I THINK BRAINS
ARE VERY SEXY.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.325
SEXY?

15:25.392 --> 15:28.361
IN A PLATONIC
SORT OF WAY.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.496
OH.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.668
YOU KNOW...

15:35.735 --> 15:39.272
YOU'RE NOT ACTING LIKE
THE STEVE URKEL
I'VE COME TO KNOW AND...

15:39.339 --> 15:41.574
TOLERATE.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.377
THAT STEVE URKEL
WOULD GET OUT OF THIS JAM

15:44.444 --> 15:47.480
BY USING THE BIGGEST
MUSCLE HE HAS--

15:47.547 --> 15:49.482
HIS BRAIN.

15:56.556 --> 16:00.027
SO I BROKE OUT
IN THIS WEIRD,
PURPLE RASH.

16:00.093 --> 16:03.230
FOR TWO WEEKS,
EVERYTHING TASTED
LIKE MUSTARD.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.301
THAT'S WHY POLYESTER
CHAFES MY THIGHS.

16:10.837 --> 16:13.040
GREAT STORY, DAD.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.713
OH, MY GOSH!

16:20.780 --> 16:21.948
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:22.015 --> 16:23.483
WE'RE DONE.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.851
WE'RE ACTUALLY DONE.

16:24.917 --> 16:25.885
REALLY?

16:25.952 --> 16:26.919
YEAH.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.988
HEY...

16:29.056 --> 16:30.423
YOU DID IT, DAD!

16:30.490 --> 16:32.192
AH AH AH AH.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.495
YOU FIXED THE ROOF.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.098
YEAH. I DID, DIDN'T I?

16:40.533 --> 16:44.137
* WHEN THIS OLD WORLD
STARTS GETTING ME DOWN *

16:44.204 --> 16:48.808
* AND PEOPLE ARE JUST
TOO MUCH FOR ME TO FACE *

16:48.875 --> 16:51.244
* UP ON THE ROOF *

16:51.311 --> 16:54.614
* I CLIMB WAY UP
TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS *

16:54.681 --> 17:01.488
* AND ALL MY CARES JUST
DRIFT RIGHT INTO SPACE *

17:01.554 --> 17:07.394
* ON THE ROOF'S
THE ONLY PLACE I KNOW *

17:08.728 --> 17:12.099
* WHERE YOU JUST HAVE
TO WISH TO MAKE IT-- *

17:12.165 --> 17:17.337
OH! SO! SO! SOOO!

17:18.037 --> 17:19.806
OH!

17:19.872 --> 17:21.341
OW!

17:21.408 --> 17:22.375
OH.

17:22.975 --> 17:24.744
HEY, DAD!

17:24.811 --> 17:26.613
HEY, DAD, YOU OKAY?

17:26.679 --> 17:28.148
OH, I'M FINE.

17:28.215 --> 17:31.118
LUCKILY, THE DRIVEWAY
BROKE MY FALL.

17:41.461 --> 17:44.564
HEY, LAURA,
LOOKS LIKE URKEL
CHICKENED OUT.

17:44.631 --> 17:48.335
TOO BAD.
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO HUMILIATING HIM.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.270
NO WONDER
HE'S SO HANDSOME.

17:50.337 --> 17:51.938
GOD PUT ALL
HIS GOOD QUALITIES

17:52.004 --> 17:54.207
ON THE OUTSIDE.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.378
WELL, I CAN'T WAIT
AROUND HERE ALL DAY.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.783
WAIT! WAIT!
EVERYBODY WAIT!

18:06.553 --> 18:09.289
DANG, I THOUGHT
I COULD REMEMBER
WITHOUT THE PAPER.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.695
STEVE IS STILL SUITING UP.
PHILLIPS, YOU GO FIRST.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.199
ALRIGHT, PHILLIPS.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.800
COME ON, LET'S HUSTLE.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.607
GO!

18:34.881 --> 18:36.048
4.9 SECONDS.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.417
YOU BROKE
YOUR RECORD.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.651
YEAH!

18:40.553 --> 18:42.689
FOR YOU, BABY.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.991
PUT YOUR SHIRT ON.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.260
COULDN'T WE HAVE
TAKEN A VOTE?

18:48.628 --> 18:51.864
I'M A LOCK. URKEL
WILL NEVER BEAT MY TIME.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.566
GUESS AGAIN!

19:10.016 --> 19:12.285
HEY,
WHAT'S THAT?

19:13.152 --> 19:16.155
LOOK, LISTEN, AND LEARN.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.692
COACH...

19:20.360 --> 19:22.629
IF YOU PLEASE.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.864
READY...

19:24.931 --> 19:26.633
SET...

19:26.699 --> 19:27.667
GO!

19:34.073 --> 19:36.175
3.2 SECONDS!

19:36.243 --> 19:38.445
THAT'S A NEW RECORD!

20:08.941 --> 20:10.577
PARDON MY EXHAUST.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.347
STEVE, YOU DID IT!
YOU WON!

20:14.414 --> 20:16.883
FEAST YOUR EYES
ONE LAST TIME...

20:17.950 --> 20:20.420
AND THEN HIT
THE ROAD, JACK.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.656
ALRIGHT!
YEAH!

20:39.138 --> 20:40.940
CARL!

20:41.007 --> 20:42.309
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.944
HE FIXED THE ROOF.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.112
AH...

20:46.178 --> 20:47.647
'NUFF SAID.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.751
THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
I FIXED THE ROOF.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.220
YES, CARL,
YOU FIXED THE ROOF...

20:54.287 --> 20:57.290
AND ALL IT COST YOU
WAS AN ARM AND A LEG.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.965
DAD, WHAT HAPPENED?

21:06.032 --> 21:08.167
YOUR FATHER
FIXED THE ROOF.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.702
AH...

21:09.769 --> 21:10.970
'NUFF SAID.

21:12.238 --> 21:14.674
YOU KNOW,
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE FALLEN

21:14.741 --> 21:18.378
IF YOU'D BEEN WEARING
ONE OF THESE BABIES.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.979
WHAT IS THAT?

21:20.046 --> 21:23.816
THE ONE AND ONLY
XJ-3 JET-PROPELLED
URKEL PACK.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.486
DOES IT REALLY WORK?

21:26.553 --> 21:28.020
WHY,
ABSO-TOOTLE-UTELY.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.456
ALL YOU DO
IS PRESS THIS--

21:29.522 --> 21:32.124
NO! NO! DON'T! DON'T!
DON'T! DON'T!

21:32.191 --> 21:34.026
DON'T.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.963
RELAX, BIG GUY.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.030
IT'S GOT A SAFETY.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.732
GOOD.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.870
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WASN'T ON!

21:53.179 --> 21:56.416
WHOOOA!
