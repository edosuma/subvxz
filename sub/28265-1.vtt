00:00.984 --> 00:05.734
("Quattroporte" by Craig Gannon)

02:01.496 --> 02:05.336
(car crashes with a bang)

02:05.336 --> 02:07.919
(tense music)

02:13.070 --> 02:15.270
- In all the years that I've
been your literary agent,

02:15.270 --> 02:17.920
this is the first time you've
ever missed a deadline.

02:19.100 --> 02:22.420
Twenty two best selling crime thrillers

02:22.420 --> 02:25.393
and murder mysteries and
now you've hit the wall.

02:26.270 --> 02:28.840
I know you've suffered
writers block in the past,

02:28.840 --> 02:31.250
but you've always come through it.

02:31.250 --> 02:35.030
And I know that it's been a terrible year,

02:35.030 --> 02:37.520
it's been hard on you, I can't imagine.

02:37.520 --> 02:40.113
- We'd been divorced ten years, Richard.

02:41.170 --> 02:43.703
Plus, you know, I've had
time to get used to it.

02:45.010 --> 02:46.950
Three years, she battled it.

02:46.950 --> 02:47.783
- Gilda.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.480
Strong woman.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.313
I liked her.

02:51.313 --> 02:52.223
- Fierce cow.

02:53.980 --> 02:56.370
You know after twenty
years of being together,

02:56.370 --> 02:59.630
we really didn't like each
other all that much at the end

03:01.690 --> 03:02.890
but we loved each other.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.190
You know what I mean?

03:06.680 --> 03:10.640
Plus, she gave me Ethel, my princess.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.200
- She idolizes you.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.253
- She's my world.

03:16.300 --> 03:19.540
Look, about the book, I
don't know what to tell you.

03:19.540 --> 03:22.190
Give me a few weeks, a month maybe?

03:22.190 --> 03:23.493
I mean, it's all up here,

03:25.006 --> 03:26.560
I mean, you know how I work, I just,

03:26.560 --> 03:27.657
this time I just can't seem to get it out.

03:27.657 --> 03:28.893
- Take your time.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.780
But you know how this business works,

03:31.780 --> 03:33.680
I have to give the partners something.

03:35.430 --> 03:37.570
Just write it down on the back of a napkin

03:37.570 --> 03:39.970
and I'll get Tiffany to type it up.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.370
- I just need to get in
the right frame of mind.

03:43.210 --> 03:45.090
It's not easy, you know.

03:45.090 --> 03:47.350
- Why don't you, why don't you go

03:47.350 --> 03:49.710
to your place in France,
blow away the cobwebs?

03:49.710 --> 03:52.254
- I don't think Ethel's ready for that.

03:52.254 --> 03:54.300
She hasn't been there since we were

03:54.300 --> 03:55.760
last there with Gilda.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.360
- She can cope for a
couple of weeks on her own.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.580
I mean, I can always pop round and

04:00.580 --> 04:02.670
you know, make sure that she's okay.

04:02.670 --> 04:04.580
You call me if you need me Harry,

04:04.580 --> 04:05.990
I'm only a phone call away.

04:05.990 --> 04:08.683
- Thank you, you know I appreciate it.

04:11.205 --> 04:13.883
(glasses clink)

04:13.883 --> 04:16.466
(somber music)

04:35.994 --> 04:38.744
(doorbell rings)

04:42.085 --> 04:44.418
- The great Detective Rawle.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.593
How may I be of service?

04:48.930 --> 04:50.030
Can I get you a drink?

04:52.430 --> 04:53.330
- Sit down, Harry.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.283
I'm so sorry to have to tell you this.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.520
I insisted on being the one to come here

05:11.520 --> 05:12.733
and inform you myself.

05:16.810 --> 05:19.410
It's about Ethel that I'm
here to talk to you about.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.190
- Ethel?

05:22.190 --> 05:23.890
Why, what's the matter with Ethel?

05:29.450 --> 05:30.863
Oh, I see.

05:32.571 --> 05:35.154
(somber music)

05:38.680 --> 05:42.803
I have this friend back in
L.A, Dennis, he's an ex cop.

05:44.070 --> 05:45.653
24 years he put in.

05:48.810 --> 05:51.717
Deathograms, that's what
he used to call this.

05:51.717 --> 05:55.810
This is what he calls it, this
is what you're doing, right?

05:55.810 --> 05:58.577
- Like I said, I had to be the one

05:58.577 --> 06:00.203
to come here and tell you.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.163
I had to be, I couldn't ask anyone else.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.290
- What happened, David?

06:07.290 --> 06:10.240
- She was involved in a car
accident a couple of hours ago.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.260
She was pronounced

06:17.210 --> 06:19.437
she was pronounced dead at the scene.

06:23.987 --> 06:25.323
I'm really sorry, Harry.

06:26.576 --> 06:28.510
I'm so, so sorry, mate.

06:28.510 --> 06:30.710
It's never easy, things
like this, you know?

06:32.133 --> 06:33.466
- What happened?

06:34.760 --> 06:37.460
- She was crossing the road
when she was hit by a car.

06:38.330 --> 06:41.720
The driver, he said he
didn't stand a chance

06:41.720 --> 06:43.540
of stopping in time, she just stepped

06:43.540 --> 06:44.830
right out in front of him.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.570
- I want to see her, I need to see her.

06:46.570 --> 06:47.536
- Yeah, of course, of course, yeah.

06:47.536 --> 06:49.970
I'll drive you myself.

06:49.970 --> 06:51.460
Is there someone you want me to call--

06:51.460 --> 06:52.293
- No, no.

06:54.617 --> 06:55.817
No, there's no-one else.

06:58.739 --> 06:59.739
Just me now.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.189
Just me.

07:05.557 --> 07:10.557
("In Paradisum" by Faure)

10:17.758 --> 10:22.758
- [Mr Williams] Harry, I just
don't know what to say to you.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.123
- There's nothing you can say.

10:26.550 --> 10:29.630
There's nothing anyone can say.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.960
- I just want to help
you to get through this.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.223
We want to help you to get through this.

10:37.690 --> 10:40.273
- I keep having this nightmare.

10:43.250 --> 10:47.250
I have the same nightmare,
every night ever since she...

10:49.560 --> 10:52.213
My beautiful princess,
my darling and she's,

10:53.780 --> 10:58.230
she's lying there in
the mortuary, all alone.

11:01.730 --> 11:04.423
She's cold and she's alone.

11:06.890 --> 11:08.730
No-one there to tuck her in,

11:08.730 --> 11:11.793
no-one there to kiss her goodnight.

11:16.450 --> 11:18.060
- Look, about--

11:18.060 --> 11:19.000
- The book?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.440
I can't even think about that right now.

11:22.440 --> 11:25.546
My mind, the thoughts
are going through there

11:25.546 --> 11:27.350
at a hundred miles an hour.

11:27.350 --> 11:28.410
- No, of course.

11:28.410 --> 11:32.400
The partners have already
agreed to delay the launch,

11:32.400 --> 11:36.023
to put back the press junket and all that.

11:38.740 --> 11:41.700
But this might be a good time to

11:44.010 --> 11:45.040
- To what?

11:45.040 --> 11:48.430
- Well, the agency was
wondering, you know,

11:48.430 --> 11:53.430
if well, to be very frank,
if you would reconsider

11:54.460 --> 11:58.597
the offer to start on your memoirs.

11:58.597 --> 12:02.029
With your fan base, Harry,
it would fly off the shelves.

12:02.029 --> 12:02.949
- I don't know,

12:02.949 --> 12:07.949
I don't know if this is a good
time to be starting anything.

12:08.090 --> 12:11.423
- Well, I just wanted
you to think about that.

12:12.790 --> 12:13.873
It might help,

12:15.530 --> 12:19.290
be like therapy, a catharsis.

12:19.290 --> 12:21.110
With everything that's happened,

12:21.110 --> 12:26.110
you know, the emotions are so raw,

12:26.610 --> 12:29.610
but the first thing,
the most important thing

12:29.610 --> 12:33.383
is you, Harry, you're a friend first.

12:36.658 --> 12:40.741
("Requiem in D Minor" by Mozart)

14:02.920 --> 14:06.043
- I'll be fine from here,
je marche d'où je suis.

14:07.033 --> 14:11.116
("Requiem in D Minor" by Mozart)

15:17.342 --> 15:20.842
("Va, Pensiero" by Verdi)

17:16.860 --> 17:19.860
(typewriter clicks)

18:11.020 --> 18:14.187
(wolves howl outside)

18:15.735 --> 18:17.046
- [Ethel] Daddy.

18:17.046 --> 18:19.796
(ominous music)

18:42.327 --> 18:43.660
- [Sarah] Louie?

18:45.314 --> 18:49.026
Come on boy, Louie?

18:49.026 --> 18:54.026
Louie!

19:04.610 --> 19:05.610
Louie, here!

19:08.620 --> 19:09.453
Louie!

19:10.807 --> 19:12.567
Louie, come on.

19:12.567 --> 19:13.400
Come on!

19:14.720 --> 19:19.053
(the young women continue to shout)

19:36.460 --> 19:37.323
- Excuse me.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.410
Can I help you?

19:42.410 --> 19:44.640
- Oh, I'm sorry, we were
looking for our dog, Louie,

19:44.640 --> 19:46.458
have you seen him, he's a King Charles.

19:46.458 --> 19:50.720
- No, I haven't, probably
because this is private property.

19:50.720 --> 19:51.660
What's your name?

19:51.660 --> 19:54.085
- I'm Sarah, and this
is my sister, Eloise.

19:54.085 --> 19:57.585
("Un Bel Di" by Puccini)

20:09.090 --> 20:12.140
I am so sorry, we're staying
next door for a few weeks.

20:12.140 --> 20:13.410
Our dog got in here a couple of times

20:13.410 --> 20:16.250
but we didn't realize
anyone was living here.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.130
Hang on, you're him, aren't you?

20:18.130 --> 20:18.963
The author.

20:18.963 --> 20:21.400
Well, our dad, he's a writer
too, he's read all your stuff.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.712
Dead Man Walking, Fifteen--

20:22.712 --> 20:26.000
- You have to excuse
me, I have to get back.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.473
I hope you find your dog.

20:28.940 --> 20:30.317
The main entrance is back that way,

20:30.317 --> 20:31.803
you can see yourselves out.

20:33.550 --> 20:35.643
Please see to it that you do.

20:36.966 --> 20:40.633
("Le Cygne" by Saint-Saens)

22:09.942 --> 22:13.025

22:23.463 --> 22:26.463
(floorboards creak)

23:02.820 --> 23:05.737
(loud bang echoes)

23:08.275 --> 23:11.358
(tense, eerie music)

23:36.913 --> 23:39.996
(Harry cries softly)

23:49.923 --> 23:54.256
(melancholy orchestral opera music)

25:21.850 --> 25:23.710
- Hey, you're the man from next door.

25:23.710 --> 25:25.130
- Harry, yeah, right.

25:25.130 --> 25:25.963
Right, hello.

25:25.963 --> 25:27.820
- Eloise, that man from next door's here.

25:27.820 --> 25:29.210
- What can I get for you?

25:29.210 --> 25:30.180
- You work here?

25:30.180 --> 25:32.997
- I'm just helping out, my
dad knows the owners, so.

25:32.997 --> 25:34.200
- Oh, right, yes.

25:34.200 --> 25:38.420
Uh, well I'll have a
glass of red wine, please.

25:38.420 --> 25:39.783
Thank you, Eloise.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.083
I wanted to thank you.

25:43.410 --> 25:45.910
I wanted to thank you for the food.

25:45.910 --> 25:47.560
- Well, a man can't
live on red wine alone.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.647
- Well, I've done all right so far.

25:50.877 --> 25:54.230
- And I wanted to apologize for the dog.

25:54.230 --> 25:57.010
- Look, we got off on the wrong foot.

25:57.010 --> 25:58.120
- It's fine.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.210
I just hope that you ate.

25:59.210 --> 26:01.640
- I did, oh I ate, yes.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.360
I really appreciate it,
you didn't have to do that.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.210
- Well, I'm glad.

26:05.960 --> 26:06.843
- Look, um,

26:10.390 --> 26:13.610
you don't have a pool at yours, do you?

26:13.610 --> 26:14.443
- No.

26:15.489 --> 26:17.410
- Well, if it's okay with your parents,

26:17.410 --> 26:18.520
you're welcome to come over

26:18.520 --> 26:20.170
and have a swim in mine any time.

26:21.840 --> 26:22.840
What's so funny?

26:22.840 --> 26:24.820
- We kind of already did when we

26:24.820 --> 26:26.390
didn't realize that
anyone was living there.

26:26.390 --> 26:29.596
Obviously, we wouldn't
have if we had known.

26:29.596 --> 26:33.800
- That's okay, the offer still stands.

26:33.800 --> 26:34.633
- [Sarah] Can we?

26:34.633 --> 26:35.490
- We'll ask Dad.

26:35.490 --> 26:36.513
Maybe tomorrow?

26:37.860 --> 26:38.693
Thank you.

26:44.910 --> 26:46.333
- Mr Williams, please.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.980
Yes, I'll hold.

26:51.330 --> 26:53.523
Richard, Richard, it's Harry.

26:55.660 --> 26:57.433
Good, yeah, good, how about you?

26:59.834 --> 27:04.110
Oh, it's coming along nicely,
the first chapter anyway.

27:04.110 --> 27:06.633
Much easier to think down here.

27:08.690 --> 27:10.750
Yeah, okay, all right.

27:10.750 --> 27:11.830
Sure.

27:11.830 --> 27:12.663
Yeah, okay.

27:13.740 --> 27:15.550
Right, take care.

27:15.550 --> 27:16.467
Right, bye.

28:00.395 --> 28:01.728
- [Ethel] Daddy?

28:02.653 --> 28:05.153
(tense music)

28:07.291 --> 28:08.917
Daddy?

(tense music)

29:13.664 --> 29:17.081
("Un Bel Di" by Puccini)

29:40.567 --> 29:42.710
- [Eloise] God, I love it down here.

29:42.710 --> 29:43.970
- You've been before?

29:43.970 --> 29:45.820
- [Eloise] Last year, yeah.

29:45.820 --> 29:47.220
- It's a very special place.

29:49.500 --> 29:52.460
So, what do you want to
do with your life, Eloise?

29:52.460 --> 29:53.940
- Me?

29:53.940 --> 29:54.773
- Let me guess.

29:55.690 --> 29:57.120
An actress.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.800
- Well yeah, but probably
not what you're thinking.

30:00.800 --> 30:01.633
Musical theater.

30:02.980 --> 30:03.813
- Good for you.

30:03.813 --> 30:04.683
- I mean, it's hard work.

30:05.610 --> 30:07.990
Sometimes I just, I think the odds

30:07.990 --> 30:09.950
are just stacked against me.

30:09.950 --> 30:12.323
- Youth is wasted on the young.

30:12.323 --> 30:13.480
Have you heard that?

30:13.480 --> 30:15.330
- My dad says it all the time.

30:15.330 --> 30:17.780
- Well, there's always
someone worse off, Eloise.

30:18.870 --> 30:20.290
You talk about defying odds,

30:20.290 --> 30:23.250
a very good friend of
mine, a fellow author,

30:23.250 --> 30:27.053
about five years ago,
he had it all going on.

30:28.520 --> 30:33.520
And then he had some
crazy obsessed with him.

30:33.930 --> 30:36.490
I mean, we're talking Play Misty For Me

30:36.490 --> 30:38.620
meets Fatal Attraction.

30:38.620 --> 30:43.287
Long story short, a nut with a crush

30:43.287 --> 30:45.250
completely screwed him,

30:45.250 --> 30:48.550
sold some fake story to the tabloids

30:49.700 --> 30:51.450
and this is in England, mind you,

30:51.450 --> 30:54.100
where they lap that shit up.

30:54.100 --> 30:57.433
They have it for breakfast
on their crumpets.

30:58.620 --> 30:59.770
- What happened to him?

31:00.796 --> 31:04.620
- Well, you know, he got on with his life,

31:04.620 --> 31:06.593
he wrote another book.

31:07.860 --> 31:11.680
One day, you know, everyone
thought he was a great guy

31:11.680 --> 31:13.930
and then he woke up and realized

31:13.930 --> 31:16.573
his name and reputation meant nothing.

31:18.170 --> 31:22.080
Not that that was relevant to
him, it didn't mean anything.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.260
I mean, he made the decision that getting

31:25.260 --> 31:27.610
another book published
being so much more harder,

31:27.610 --> 31:30.480
this new founded situation,

31:30.480 --> 31:32.623
wasn't a reason to give up on it.

31:34.900 --> 31:37.950
He thought that if people eventually

31:37.950 --> 31:40.993
thought he wasn't such a bad
guy after all well then, great.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.680
But that's nothing that
he had any control over.

31:45.610 --> 31:48.170
And he reminded himself daily that if that

31:48.170 --> 31:52.618
ever became his aim he'd be
fighting a losing battle.

31:52.618 --> 31:54.440
- Where is he now?

31:54.440 --> 31:57.133
- Well, we talk every now
and then on the, you know,

31:58.679 --> 32:00.880
the email. (laughs)

32:00.880 --> 32:03.423
Sorry, I'm old fashioned.

32:05.460 --> 32:09.023
Every book I ever wrote, I
wrote it on my trusty rusty.

32:10.370 --> 32:11.930
Anyway, I digress.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.033
Defying the odds.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.630
Trying to make people think better of you

32:16.630 --> 32:19.090
that don't like you just keeps them

32:19.090 --> 32:22.170
in your life, Eloise, and
you know what that means.

32:22.170 --> 32:24.160
That brings them back into your life

32:24.160 --> 32:29.160
in your life, your life, Eloise,

32:29.480 --> 32:30.880
is too short

32:30.880 --> 32:33.203
and too precious to waste on that.

32:34.760 --> 32:37.920
- My dad said something
similar but in fewer words.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.650
- What expression does your father have?

32:40.650 --> 32:43.720
- If they don't like
it, fuck 'em! (laughs)

32:43.720 --> 32:44.690
- I think he would

32:47.100 --> 32:49.893
probably summarize it
better himself now too.

32:50.860 --> 32:52.100
- How so?

32:52.100 --> 32:56.510
- Well, he would say
to anyone who said no,

32:56.510 --> 32:59.982
you can't do it, you're not good enough,

32:59.982 --> 33:02.980
it can't be done, he'd simply say

33:04.650 --> 33:05.803
don't get in my way.

33:08.930 --> 33:11.583
But after, when it's all said and done,

33:13.350 --> 33:16.530
I mean, when everything is just, you know,

33:16.530 --> 33:20.260
you could be the best actress,

33:20.260 --> 33:21.440
your father could be the best author,

33:21.440 --> 33:23.498
I could be the best artist,

33:23.498 --> 33:26.463
anybody can be the best whatever
the hell they want to be.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.523
When it's all said and done,

33:32.450 --> 33:34.350
you're only going to be asked one thing

33:34.350 --> 33:35.593
when you get up there.

33:38.542 --> 33:40.792
Were you good to your kids?

33:50.132 --> 33:53.215
(gentle opera music)

34:09.537 --> 34:12.246
- What are you writing?

34:12.246 --> 34:13.329
- My memoirs.

34:14.856 --> 34:17.006
- This one's not fiction?

34:17.006 --> 34:20.089
(gentle opera music)

34:29.703 --> 34:31.364
Looks like it's coming along nicely.

34:31.364 --> 34:33.249
- Remarkably.

34:33.249 --> 34:34.916
For the first draft.

34:36.660 --> 34:39.529
It's all about finding your muse.

34:39.529 --> 34:42.696
(gentle opera music)

34:53.275 --> 34:54.108
Sante.

34:54.960 --> 34:55.936
- Sante.

34:55.936 --> 34:59.019
(gentle opera music)

35:03.936 --> 35:05.936
Goodnight, Harry Newman.

35:10.619 --> 35:13.702
(gentle opera music)

36:02.067 --> 36:04.567
(tense music)

36:31.441 --> 36:34.858
(dramatic, urgent music)

36:42.450 --> 36:44.471
- [Harry] Ethel!

36:44.471 --> 36:47.888
(dramatic, urgent music)

36:50.074 --> 36:51.345
Ethel!

36:51.345 --> 36:54.762
(dramatic, urgent music)

37:06.716 --> 37:10.216
(tense, melancholy music)

37:31.202 --> 37:32.035
Ethel!

37:36.668 --> 37:37.501
Ethel!

37:41.162 --> 37:41.995
Ethel!

37:49.548 --> 37:53.131
(somber, melancholy music)

39:58.848 --> 40:03.848
("Air On The G String"
by Johann Sebastian Bach)

41:02.369 --> 41:04.869
(tense music)

42:04.114 --> 42:05.960
- [Ethel] Daddy.

42:05.960 --> 42:06.793
Daddy.

42:09.134 --> 42:09.967
Daddy.

42:11.492 --> 42:12.325
Daddy.

42:14.130 --> 42:14.963
Daddy.

42:16.998 --> 42:17.831
Daddy.

42:19.442 --> 42:20.275
Daddy.

42:23.137 --> 42:23.970
Daddy.

42:25.156 --> 42:27.739
(joyful music)

42:59.734 --> 43:01.311
- Harry.

43:01.311 --> 43:02.144
Harry.

43:05.173 --> 43:06.390
- Ethel.

43:06.390 --> 43:08.623
- No, Harry, it's Eloise.

43:10.380 --> 43:11.213
Harry.

43:12.074 --> 43:13.069
It's Eloise.

43:13.069 --> 43:14.030
- Ethel.

43:14.030 --> 43:16.010
- You've had a bump on your head, Harry.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.810
How long have you been out here for?

43:19.110 --> 43:21.890
Come on, come on, let's try get you up.

43:21.890 --> 43:22.723
Come on.

43:26.419 --> 43:27.923
Easy, easy.

43:29.130 --> 43:29.963
Easy.

43:40.113 --> 43:42.613
(door creaks)

43:52.830 --> 43:56.150
- Why don't you take a seat

43:59.290 --> 44:01.130
in the drawing room?

44:01.130 --> 44:02.473
- Harry, you might need to see a doctor.

44:02.473 --> 44:05.940
- I'll live to see another day.

44:05.940 --> 44:08.720
Just sit down, I'll make us some coffee.

44:08.720 --> 44:09.930
- Are you sure?

44:09.930 --> 44:12.073
You can barely stand, you're
holding on to the wall.

44:12.073 --> 44:15.403
- Yeah, no, I think I'm,

44:16.350 --> 44:19.090
I just need to walk around a little bit,

44:19.090 --> 44:21.143
get the blood circulating again.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.410
Trust an old man, will you?

44:24.410 --> 44:28.163
Go ahead, go and sit down,
I can get things started.

44:29.020 --> 44:30.420
I'll be there in a few minutes.

44:30.420 --> 44:32.760
- Okay, if you're sure.

44:32.760 --> 44:34.410
- I'm sure.

44:34.410 --> 44:35.660
I've been through worse.

44:35.660 --> 44:36.493
- Okay.

44:43.584 --> 44:44.667
- Here we go.

44:45.766 --> 44:46.766
- Thank you.

44:49.830 --> 44:50.883
How are you feeling?

44:51.970 --> 44:52.963
- I'll be okay.

44:56.370 --> 44:58.280
I wanna thank you for

45:00.590 --> 45:03.053
well, you know.

45:04.150 --> 45:06.493
- What was you doing up a
ladder, for goodness sake?

45:07.890 --> 45:12.820
- I was just, uh, there was this ribbon,

45:12.820 --> 45:14.333
it was stuck in the tree.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.093
I don't know how it got there.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.063
It was bothering me.

45:22.420 --> 45:23.870
It shouldn't have been there,

45:25.010 --> 45:27.230
it wasn't supposed to be there.

45:27.230 --> 45:28.245
She--

45:28.245 --> 45:29.453
- Hey, hey.

45:30.520 --> 45:31.353
You okay?

45:32.966 --> 45:34.470
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

45:34.470 --> 45:37.480
It's just my, just my head, you know.

45:39.617 --> 45:40.450
I'll be fine.

45:41.360 --> 45:43.060
- Harry, I'm sorry you're hurting.

45:44.340 --> 45:45.173
- Thank you.

45:49.100 --> 45:51.573
- No, I mean,

45:52.860 --> 45:54.733
I'm sorry you're hurting.

45:56.730 --> 45:59.113
My dad, he read about it.

46:01.210 --> 46:02.210
About what happened.

46:06.960 --> 46:11.133
No parent should ever
have to bury a child.

46:11.133 --> 46:13.716
(somber music)

46:19.080 --> 46:21.333
- You're an old soul, aren't you?

46:24.660 --> 46:25.960
- You miss her, don't you?

46:35.790 --> 46:36.793
- So much.

46:39.270 --> 46:40.753
I'll see her again one day.

46:45.150 --> 46:47.403
She was a dancer, a singer.

46:50.370 --> 46:51.383
Just like you.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.813
She got it from her mother.

46:58.420 --> 46:59.833
What a woman!

47:03.030 --> 47:06.963
She did it all; Broadway,
West End, you name it.

47:17.670 --> 47:19.293
- I've never known anyone who's,

47:21.700 --> 47:22.600
anyone who's died.

47:26.940 --> 47:28.340
What do you think it's like?

47:29.294 --> 47:31.877
(somber music)

47:38.260 --> 47:39.653
- One minute you're there,

47:42.480 --> 47:43.313
then nothing.

47:46.890 --> 47:47.833
After,

47:49.280 --> 47:50.240
there's nothing.

47:52.715 --> 47:55.632
(melancholy music)

48:00.700 --> 48:03.350
- Oh Harry, I'm sorry, he
must have gotten out again.

48:05.110 --> 48:07.120
I hope that gets better.

48:07.120 --> 48:09.387
I'll be back tomorrow
to check on you, okay?

48:09.387 --> 48:12.304
(melancholy music)

48:17.820 --> 48:21.270
- Harry, Harry, it's me.

48:21.270 --> 48:24.850
Now, don't forget that
I'm gonna be on my way

48:24.850 --> 48:28.850
back from that meeting in
Avignon tomorrow morning.

48:28.850 --> 48:32.230
And well, I just thought that I'd pop by,

48:32.230 --> 48:34.530
and see if the old place
is still standing up.

48:36.340 --> 48:38.610
Look, we can do lunch in the village.

48:38.610 --> 48:40.840
- Well, it's good to hear.

48:40.840 --> 48:42.483
Well, it's finished.

48:43.400 --> 48:45.223
At least the first two chapters.

48:46.410 --> 48:47.913
Hot off the press.

48:48.840 --> 48:53.753
Yeah, well this is all new to
me, this self-portrait but uh,

48:55.933 --> 48:58.710
yeah, yes, good.

48:58.710 --> 49:01.647
Okay, I'll see you then.

49:01.647 --> 49:02.480
Bye.

49:28.326 --> 49:31.576
(tense, ominous music)

50:12.817 --> 50:14.150
- [Ethel] Daddy.

50:15.991 --> 50:19.241
(tense, ominous music)

50:29.449 --> 50:32.449
(floorboards creak)

51:49.123 --> 51:52.373
(tense, ominous music)

52:08.180 --> 52:11.180
(floorboards creak)

52:12.301 --> 52:14.626
(something clatters in the distance)

52:14.626 --> 52:17.626

53:02.592 --> 53:05.425

There you are!

- Ethel!

54:33.320 --> 54:34.153
You're here.

54:34.153 --> 54:35.260
- I couldn't sleep.

54:35.260 --> 54:38.267
The wolves are fighting again.

54:38.267 --> 54:39.100
- No, I mean

54:41.260 --> 54:42.370
you're here.

54:42.370 --> 54:43.293
- Oh shush.

54:45.196 --> 54:46.029
Come.

54:46.980 --> 54:47.940
Come sit with me.

54:57.090 --> 54:58.970
- What are you listening to?

54:58.970 --> 55:00.473
- Some of your old records.

55:02.590 --> 55:03.840
Do you remember this one?

55:05.060 --> 55:06.302
You and Mom used to--

55:06.302 --> 55:07.385
- I remember.

55:10.464 --> 55:11.297
Oh, Ethel.

55:13.200 --> 55:14.483
My princess.

55:18.010 --> 55:19.293
I love you so much.

55:22.069 --> 55:27.069
So very much.

55:30.471 --> 55:33.388
(melancholy music)

56:03.905 --> 56:06.464
- [Detective Rawle] I'm so
sorry to have to tell you this.

56:06.464 --> 56:07.473
I insisted on being the one to come here

56:07.473 --> 56:08.923
and inform you myself.

56:11.130 --> 56:14.221
It's about Ethel that I'm
here to talk to you about.

56:14.221 --> 56:15.870
- [Harry] Ethel?

56:15.870 --> 56:18.260
Why, what's the matter with Ethel, what?

56:18.260 --> 56:19.563
Oh, I see.

56:22.600 --> 56:26.693
I have this friend back in
L.A, Dennis, he's an ex cop.

56:28.129 --> 56:30.812
24 years he put in.

56:30.812 --> 56:33.700
Deathograms, that's what
he used to call this,

56:34.590 --> 56:37.700
this is what he called it,
this is what you do, right?

56:37.700 --> 56:40.730
- [Detective Rawle] Like I said, I had to

56:40.730 --> 56:42.580
be the one to come here and tell you.

56:43.960 --> 56:46.383
I had to be, I couldn't ask anyone else.

56:47.450 --> 56:49.316
- [Harry] What happened, David?

56:49.316 --> 56:50.149
- [Detective Rawle] She was involved

56:50.149 --> 56:53.482
in a car accident a couple of hours ago.

56:54.325 --> 56:55.908
She was pronounced,

56:57.981 --> 57:01.234
she was pronounced dead at the scene.

57:01.234 --> 57:04.817
(somber, melancholy music)

58:00.069 --> 58:01.257
- Bonjour.

58:01.257 --> 58:02.090
- Bonjour.

58:03.589 --> 58:06.655
The girl, Eloise?

58:06.655 --> 58:07.572
- Monsieur?

58:08.640 --> 58:11.030
- There was a young
girl here the other day.

58:11.030 --> 58:12.303
Blonde, young?

58:13.463 --> 58:14.400
Eloise?

58:14.400 --> 58:15.354
- Eloise?

58:15.354 --> 58:17.748
- Yes, Eloise.

58:17.748 --> 58:20.560
- I'm sorry, monsieur,
there's no Eloise here.

58:20.560 --> 58:21.393
- Eloise!

58:21.393 --> 58:22.226
- Oui.

58:23.151 --> 58:24.883
I do not understand.

58:25.780 --> 58:27.900
But I think I'm only here a few weeks.

58:27.900 --> 58:31.532
I'm new so maybe I do not meet
all of the other girls yet?

58:31.532 --> 58:32.615
- No, no, no.

58:35.351 --> 58:38.934
(somber, melancholy music)

58:51.850 --> 58:53.187
- Harry.

58:53.187 --> 58:56.350
Harry, it's me, Richard.

58:56.350 --> 59:01.350
I'm, uh, I'm about 20 minutes
out, according to the GPS.

59:02.410 --> 59:04.430
Just passed St. Saturnin.

59:04.430 --> 59:05.730
- I can't wait to see you.

59:06.770 --> 59:09.640
- Anyway, I've left you 15 messages

59:09.640 --> 59:12.320
but I haven't heard anything from you.

59:12.320 --> 59:17.260
But either way, well I'll
be with you in a few.

59:17.260 --> 59:19.590
And then we can get that rose open.

59:21.050 --> 59:23.270
Call me back when you get this.

59:23.270 --> 59:27.197
- I think this is the magnum
opus you've been hoping for.

59:28.106 --> 59:30.606
(tense music)

59:33.979 --> 59:34.812
- Louie!

59:36.146 --> 59:37.229
Come on, boy.

59:38.805 --> 59:39.638
Louie?

59:41.177 --> 59:43.594
(flies buzz)

59:47.002 --> 59:50.252
(tense, ominous music)

59:56.616 --> 59:57.449
Harry?

1:00:11.821 --> 1:00:12.654
Harry?

1:00:14.333 --> 1:00:16.833
(tense music)

1:00:56.393 --> 1:00:58.976
- What are you doing with that?

1:01:00.804 --> 1:01:02.804
- I'm sorry, I was just.

1:01:04.634 --> 1:01:06.384
- You were just what?

1:01:07.823 --> 1:01:08.823
Put it down.

1:01:09.931 --> 1:01:10.931
Put it down!

1:01:13.980 --> 1:01:15.080
Didn't your father ever tell you

1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:17.793
not to touch things that
don't belong to you?

1:01:19.060 --> 1:01:20.103
That's mine!

1:01:21.530 --> 1:01:22.833
My finest work.

1:01:24.420 --> 1:01:26.423
Do you know how long that took?

1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:30.123
It's a masterpiece.

1:01:34.892 --> 1:01:37.940
- I made a terrible mistake, I need to go.

1:01:37.940 --> 1:01:39.590
My dad's expecting me home.

1:01:41.546 --> 1:01:43.030
What are you going to do with that?

1:01:43.030 --> 1:01:46.303
- What needs to be done.

1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:49.410
- Harry, stop!

1:01:49.410 --> 1:01:50.921
You're hurting yourself!

1:01:50.921 --> 1:01:55.190
- You don't know what pain is!

1:01:55.190 --> 1:01:56.607
You have no idea.

1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:05.137
(dramatic, urgent music)

1:02:47.507 --> 1:02:48.340
- Dad?

1:02:49.266 --> 1:02:53.280
Daddy, I don't have time to
explain but I'm at Harry's.

1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:54.613
He's gone crazy.

1:02:55.669 --> 1:02:59.234
Please, just come as soon
as you get this message.

1:02:59.234 --> 1:03:01.651

1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:33.550

1:04:36.026 --> 1:04:37.109
I had it all.

1:05:10.385 --> 1:05:14.117

Stop, wait.

1:06:32.283 --> 1:06:35.200
(melancholy music)

1:06:47.183 --> 1:06:48.016
- Harry?

1:06:50.117 --> 1:06:50.950
Harry?

1:06:54.057 --> 1:06:55.173
- You inspired me.

1:06:56.540 --> 1:06:57.963
Everything you did.

1:06:59.030 --> 1:07:00.343
You built me up.

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:03.133
You were my everything!

1:07:04.270 --> 1:07:05.943
Everything you did.

1:07:07.617 --> 1:07:08.873
You were my world.

1:07:47.783 --> 1:07:48.616
Oh shit.

1:07:49.751 --> 1:07:52.630
- I'm not her, Harry,
I'm not your daughter.

1:07:52.630 --> 1:07:53.920
- You built me up!

1:07:53.920 --> 1:07:56.050
Ethel, the thing of it is

1:07:59.819 --> 1:08:02.834
I don't want to forget you.

1:08:02.834 --> 1:08:03.746
- Harry!

1:08:03.746 --> 1:08:04.579
Stop!

1:08:07.220 --> 1:08:08.797
- I'm afraid I'll forget you.

1:08:10.300 --> 1:08:11.283
- It'll be okay.

1:08:13.690 --> 1:08:14.523
- Love.

1:08:16.270 --> 1:08:17.713
True love.

1:08:18.840 --> 1:08:23.763
True love is the only thing
that surpasses all of time.

the death of one's own children.

1:09:58.480 --> 1:09:59.330
- [Harry] Eloise.

1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:01.633
She

1:10:04.470 --> 1:10:06.627
she was never really there

1:10:08.137 --> 1:10:08.970
was she?

1:10:10.380 --> 1:10:11.880
- But your love for Ethel was.

1:10:14.450 --> 1:10:18.263
Eloise was a manifestation
of your love for her.

1:10:19.150 --> 1:10:22.600
You yearned to be
reunited with her so much,

1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:25.380
so strong was your love for your daughter,

1:10:25.380 --> 1:10:29.970
the one person who made you
happier than anyone else,

1:10:29.970 --> 1:10:34.253

ever hold a candle to.

Down here in the muck,
scavenging and grasping

1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:55.823
for well, for hope,

1:10:57.090 --> 1:10:59.640
you created your very own fairytale

1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:01.800
right here in your gingerbread house

1:11:03.580 --> 1:11:06.823
and you stayed here to be with your child.

1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:10.530
Love is merely a madness.
