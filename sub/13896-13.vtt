WEBVTT

00:05.130 --> 00:07.250
[KARLA] I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS
LOOKING TO THIS FOR US.

00:07.300 --> 00:08.630
I MEAN, WITH MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS PASSING

00:08.670 --> 00:11.220
THROUGH HERE ON THEIR WAY
TO ATM'S EVERY DAY,

00:11.260 --> 00:13.430
NO ONE GETS THROUGH
THOSE DOORS WITHOUT
A SECURITY CHECK.

00:13.470 --> 00:15.550
WELL, UM, MY ADVICE?

00:15.600 --> 00:17.310
I WOULDN'T HIRE
ANY OF THESE GUYS.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.020
NONE OF THEM
HAVE RECORDS,

00:19.060 --> 00:22.190
BUT WE WERE ABLE TO DIG UP
ACCUSATIONS OF PETTY THEFT
AND PILFERING.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.770
THAT ONE HAS A GAMBLING HABIT.

00:25.560 --> 00:28.020
THANKS AGAIN. FOLLOW ME.

00:31.900 --> 00:34.240
AND WAIT HERE, OKAY?
I'LL GET THE CHECK.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.240
[MAL] HONEST TO GOD, JAKE.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.080
YOU HAVE TO HIT
ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM?

00:37.120 --> 00:39.330
WHAT, B'Y?
DON'T BE SUCH A PRUDE.
IT'S CALLED FLIRTING.

00:39.370 --> 00:43.540
PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF,
YOU KNOW, 120,
THEY TEND TO DO IT A LOT.

00:43.580 --> 00:45.540
THIS PLACE FROM THE OUTSIDE
LOOKS LIKE A WAREHOUSE.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.380
YOU'D NEVER KNOW THAT
EVERY ATM IN THE PROVINCE

00:47.420 --> 00:49.460
-IS PROBABLY GETTING
CASH FROM THIS PLACE.
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

00:51.210 --> 00:52.590
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I'M WORKING.

00:52.630 --> 00:54.090
-UNDERWEAR. -WHAT?

00:54.130 --> 00:55.220
DO YOU LIKE THEM FOLDED
OR ROLLED?

00:55.260 --> 00:57.140
PERSONALLY, I'M A ROLLED
MAN MYSELF.

00:57.180 --> 00:58.760
WHY ARE YOU TOUCHING
MY UNDERWEAR?

00:58.810 --> 01:00.890
OH, HEY TINNY!
HERE'S YOUR BRA.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.310
W-WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY
TO MY NIECE?

01:02.350 --> 01:05.100
UH, I SAID... UH, I SAID,
"WHAT'RE YA AT, BRA."

01:06.860 --> 01:08.690
DESSY'S JUST BEING A
GOOD LITTLE HOUSEWIFE.

01:08.730 --> 01:10.400
OKAY, YOU TWO.
FIRST OF ALL,

01:10.440 --> 01:12.650
WE GOTTA START LAYING DOWN
SOME HOUSE RULES, ALL RIGHT?

01:12.690 --> 01:14.490
-CHILL! WE'RE FINE.
-&lt;WHISPERING&gt; IS THIS JAKE'S?

01:14.530 --> 01:16.950
RULE NUMBER 1.
NEVER TELL ME TO CHILL.

01:16.990 --> 01:18.320
RULE NUMBER 2.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.990
DON'T TOUCH EACH OTHER'S
UNDERWEAR. EVER.
EVER, EVER.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.540
-(CLATTERING HEARD ON PHONE)
-[TINNY] AH!

01:22.580 --> 01:24.290
-&lt;GLASS SHATTERING&gt; -TINNY?

01:24.330 --> 01:26.670
-TINNY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
-&lt;GASPS&gt;

01:26.710 --> 01:29.170
-HEY, KIDS!
-OH, MY GOD! UNCLE JAKE,
THERE'S A MAN IN THE HOUSE!

01:29.710 --> 01:31.210
[DES] AH! OW!

01:31.250 --> 01:33.880
-COME HERE! WHOO!
-&lt;WHIMPERS&gt;

01:33.920 --> 01:35.260
-TINNY!
-WHAT IS IT?

01:35.300 --> 01:36.510
-(COMMOTION CONTINUES)
-I DON'T KNOW!

01:36.550 --> 01:37.890
YOU LET GO OF HER,
OR ELSE!

01:40.510 --> 01:43.520
THAT'S SOME KNIGHT IN
SHINING ARMOR YOU GOT THERE.
YOU BEST TEND TO HIM.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.810
TINNY! WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ME!

01:46.900 --> 01:48.350
HEY THERE, GOOD BUDDY.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.110
I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR
YOU'RE DOING WELL.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

01:51.150 --> 01:53.150
-WHO IS THIS?
-[CROCKER] WELL, USUALLY
IF YOU THINK REAL HARD,

01:53.190 --> 01:54.690
YOU'D PROBABLY
FIGURE IT OUT,

01:55.280 --> 01:56.360
PARTNER.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.070
-CROCKER.
-OH! GOTTA GO!

01:59.120 --> 02:02.080
GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS
NEED TO BE STASHED
OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

02:02.370 --> 02:03.450
CROCKER!

02:03.490 --> 02:05.580
-CHILDREN!
-&lt;GUN COCKING&gt;

02:05.620 --> 02:07.330
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON? TELL ME!

02:08.710 --> 02:11.880
DAD, I THINK TINNY WAS
JUST KIDNAPPED.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.920
&lt;MUSIC PLAYING&gt;

02:32.860 --> 02:34.570
TINNY! DES!

02:36.610 --> 02:38.030
TINNY!

02:38.700 --> 02:40.620
JAKE, WE HAVE TO
CALL THE COPS.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.740
NO. YOU DON'T KNOW CROCKER
LIKE I DO, OKAY?

02:42.780 --> 02:44.240
THE GUY THINKS
I RUINED HIS LIFE.

02:44.290 --> 02:47.540
IF WE CALL THE COPS,
HE'S LIABLE TO DO ANYTHING.

02:47.580 --> 02:49.250
[MAL] WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
[JAKE] I DUNNO.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.210
WE GOTTA FIND
OUT WHAT HE WANTS,
AND WE GOTTA FIND TINNY.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.880
HI, GUYS.
WHAT'RE YOU DOING...

02:54.130 --> 02:55.670
WHAT'S GOING ON?
MALACHY?

02:57.420 --> 02:59.090
ROSE, SIT DOWN.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.140
TINNY AND DES...

03:02.180 --> 03:05.390
-SOMEONE'S TAKEN THEM.
-[ROSE] OH, MY GOD!

03:05.430 --> 03:08.770
WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT A GUN? WHY DOES HE...
WHY DOES HE HAVE A GUN?

03:08.810 --> 03:11.100
ROSE, WE HAVE TO STAY CALM.
JUST LET US DEAL WITH...

03:11.150 --> 03:14.440
WOULD YOU STOP IT AND JUST
TELL ME WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

03:14.480 --> 03:18.990
A VERY DANGEROUS MAN
HAS KIDNAPPED TINNY AND DES.

03:19.030 --> 03:20.410
-OH, MY GOD!
-[JAKE] KEV CROCKER.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.740
HE WAS MY PARTNER
WHEN I WAS A COP.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.660
HE WAS DIRTY, WE CAUGHT HIM.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.330
BUT HE DISAPPEARED JUST BEFORE
WE MADE THE ARREST.
THAT WAS 10 YEARS AGO.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.290
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

03:30.080 --> 03:31.290
WHATEVER WE HAVE TO.

03:31.330 --> 03:33.210
EASY, JAKE.
YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR HEAD
THROUGH THIS.

03:33.250 --> 03:35.380
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

03:40.470 --> 03:41.800
-YEAH.
-[CROCKER] ABOVE THE BATTERY.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.100
DEAD MAN'S POND, 15 MINUTES.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.140
&lt;BEEPS&gt;

03:46.390 --> 03:47.220
LET'S GO.

03:51.270 --> 03:56.360
I UNDERSTAND
YOU WERE DISCRETE AT FIRST.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.440
YOU AND THE
MAYOR KEPT YOUR PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP SECRET?

03:59.490 --> 04:01.200
-YES.
-WHY IS THAT?

04:03.280 --> 04:05.240
WE WERE BEING CAREFUL.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.240
TAKING THINGS SLOW.
THAT'S ALL.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.370
SERGEANT, I AM HERE

04:09.410 --> 04:11.210
WORKING CLOSELY
WITH THE R.N.C.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.960
AS A SPECIAL LIAISON
INVESTIGATING THE MAYOR.

04:15.330 --> 04:17.210
HE WAS YOUR... WHAT?
PARTNER, BOYFRIEND?

04:17.250 --> 04:19.130
I NEVER KNOW
WHAT TO SAY THESE DAYS.

04:19.170 --> 04:22.840
OBVIOUSLY, I ENDED MY
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
MAYOR WHEN I ARRESTED HIM.

04:23.510 --> 04:25.090
OF COURSE.

04:25.140 --> 04:28.640
DID YOU HAVE ANY
PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE
OF HIS, UH... DEALINGS?

04:28.680 --> 04:29.970
NO, I DID NOT.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.140
UH-HUH. SERGEANT BENNETT,

04:32.190 --> 04:36.440
AS AN INVESTIGATOR
AND AN OFFICER,
YOU ARE SUPERB.

04:36.480 --> 04:40.110
SO I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN
SUSPECT ANYTHING.

04:40.150 --> 04:41.820
THE SERGEANT HASN'T
COMMITTED A CRIME.

04:41.860 --> 04:43.700
THANK YOU, COUNSELOR.
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL
FOR YOU TO POINT OUT.

04:43.740 --> 04:45.660
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE HERE
REPRESENTING SERGEANT BENNETT.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.330
DO I NEED ONE?

04:47.370 --> 04:48.450
A LAWYER?

04:48.490 --> 04:49.490
HONESTLY...

04:51.250 --> 04:52.540
I DON'T KNOW.

04:52.580 --> 04:55.540
I DID NOTHING TO COMPROMISE
MY POSITION AS AN OFFICER.

04:55.580 --> 04:58.380
I SINCERELY HOPE
THAT IS THE OUTCOME
OF THIS INQUIRY.

04:58.420 --> 04:59.710
MY RECOMMENDATION
IS GOING TO BE

04:59.750 --> 05:01.510
THAT YOU ARE SUSPENDED
WITH PAY

05:01.550 --> 05:04.260
UNTIL WE CAN CONFIRM THAT
YOU ARE IN THE CLEAR.

05:05.590 --> 05:07.680
OH! I DO HOPE THAT YOU
COME TO THE PARTY

05:07.720 --> 05:10.220
THE R.N.C. IS THROWING
THIS AFTERNOON
FOR THE NEW MAYOR.

05:10.260 --> 05:12.140
IT'D BE GOOD FOR YOU
TO SHOW YOUR FACE.

05:12.180 --> 05:14.480
SEND THE RIGHT MESSAGE.
YOU KNOW, OPTICS?

05:19.020 --> 05:20.020
&lt;DOOR CLOSES&gt;

05:25.280 --> 05:26.740
&lt;DOOR CLOSES&gt;

05:26.780 --> 05:30.030
[MAL] LOOK, I KNOW CROCKER
MIGHT WANT REVENGE ON YA,
BUT WHY NOW?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.540
WHY COME BACK
AFTER ALL THIS TIME?

05:31.580 --> 05:33.290
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW.

05:33.330 --> 05:36.330
HEY. WHAT'D I SAY
ABOUT A CLEAR HEAD?

05:41.500 --> 05:43.760
&lt;CAR APPROACHING&gt;

05:47.300 --> 05:49.220
&lt;CAR DOOR OPENS BEEPING&gt;

05:51.430 --> 05:53.720
WELL! I SHOULD'VE
KNOWN YOU'D BRING
THE OLD MAN ALONG.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.390
EVERY HERO NEEDS A SIDEKICK!

05:56.140 --> 05:58.020
WHERE'S MY NIECE?

05:58.060 --> 06:00.360
WOW. 10 YEARS,
NOT EVEN "HELLO?"

06:00.400 --> 06:02.150
COMMUNICATION SKILLS
HAVEN'T IMPROVED ANY.

06:02.190 --> 06:05.400
YOU HURT THOSE KIDS,
I'LL TAKE THAT HEAD
RIGHT OFF YOUR SHOULDERS.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.950
YOU JUST RELAX, YOU OLD BOOT.
THEY'RE JUST FINE FOR NOW.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.410
[MAL] HE'S HURT!
[CROCKER] YEP!

06:12.450 --> 06:14.750
BUT THEY'LL BE OKAY
FOR A FEW HOURS,
GIVE OR TAKE.

06:14.790 --> 06:17.580
I MEAN, WE CAN ONLY HOPE.
NO HEAT, NO FOOD, NO WATER.

06:17.620 --> 06:18.670
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

06:18.710 --> 06:19.880
PHONE.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.340
NOW HERE'S THE THING.
I HEAR THAT YOU'VE BECOME

06:23.380 --> 06:24.800
SOMETHING OF A HERO
SINCE I LAST SAW YOU,

06:24.840 --> 06:26.880
SO I THOUGHT IT WAS
TIME FOR ME TO CHECK IN.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.390
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

06:29.430 --> 06:33.350
&lt;LAUGHS&gt; FOLLOW ME.
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

06:33.390 --> 06:35.220
[CROCKER] PARTNER,
YOU RIDE WITH ME.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.430
AND YOU DRIVE!

06:38.900 --> 06:40.480
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.070
GOD, IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE
YOU, BUDDY. SO GOOD!

06:46.530 --> 06:48.070
DES!

06:48.110 --> 06:49.610
&lt;GROANS&gt;

06:50.950 --> 06:52.580
HEY, YOU OKAY?

06:54.160 --> 06:56.370
AM I DEAD? I FEEL DEAD.

06:56.410 --> 06:59.210
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD!

06:59.250 --> 07:03.420
IT'S OKAY. YOU JUST...
YOU HIT YOUR HEAD.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

07:03.460 --> 07:07.010
WELL, WE ARE KIND OF
TRAPPED IN HERE ALONE.

07:07.050 --> 07:08.470
WE'RE ALONE?
LIKE JUST THE TWO OF US?

07:08.510 --> 07:11.970
LET'S JUST TRY
AND FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET OUT OF HERE, OKAY?

07:12.010 --> 07:15.600
WAIT... NO, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

07:15.640 --> 07:17.600
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
WHO WAS THAT BUDDY?

07:17.640 --> 07:19.180
ARE WE...

07:19.230 --> 07:20.690
ARE WE A PART OF SOME
SORT OF LIKE
GOVERNMENT STING THING

07:20.730 --> 07:22.980
HERE OR SOMETHING?
I MEAN...

07:23.020 --> 07:24.690
AH! DO YOU HEAR
THAT RINGING IN MY EARS?

07:24.730 --> 07:26.360
DES! GET IT TOGETHER!

07:26.400 --> 07:29.820
FOR SOME REASON
THAT GUY LOCKED US
IN HERE AND LEFT US.

07:29.860 --> 07:31.780
WE GOTTA FIND A WAY
OUTTA HERE, SO FOCUS!

07:31.820 --> 07:33.120
D'YOU THINK
HE'S GONNA COME BACK?

07:33.160 --> 07:34.870
EITHER WAY, IT'S NOT GOOD.

07:34.910 --> 07:36.580
I DON'T THINK WE CAN
LAST IN HERE LONG.

07:36.620 --> 07:39.410
WE GOTTA FIND SOMETHING
AND TRY AND PRY OPEN THE DOOR.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.620
[CROCKER] AREN'T YOU JUST
A LITTLE, TEENY BIT
HAPPY TO SEE ME, BUD?

07:41.670 --> 07:43.670
I MEAN,
IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY!

07:43.710 --> 07:45.420
-ANNIVERSARY?
-UH-HUH.

07:45.460 --> 07:48.130
TEN YEARS AGO THIS WEEK,
YOU RATTED ME OUT.

07:48.170 --> 07:50.420
LOOK, YOU WANNA TAKE OUR
HISTORY OUT ON ME,
THAT'S FINE,

07:50.470 --> 07:51.720
BUT YOU LEAVE
MY FAMILY OUT OF IT.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.220
I HAD TO GET YOUR
ATTENTION SOMEHOW.

07:54.260 --> 07:56.970
AND THE THING IS,
YOU DO HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.980
AND ME? WHAT DO I HAVE?

07:59.020 --> 08:01.100
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICES,
AND I MADE MINE.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.690
I REMEMBER YOUR CHOICES.

08:04.730 --> 08:07.190
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I FIGURED OUT A WAY
FOR YOU TO MAKE IT UP TO ME.

08:10.860 --> 08:12.070
&lt;DIALING&gt;

08:12.110 --> 08:13.780
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

08:13.820 --> 08:16.120
-HELLO?
-ROSE, I SAW THEM
ON A VIDEO.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.490
THEY'RE ALIVE AT LEAST.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.250
IT WAS SOME KIND
OF ABANDONED WAREHOUSE.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.330
OKAY, THAT'S A LEAD,
THAT'S SOMETHING.

08:21.370 --> 08:24.250
HE HAD A TAKE-OUT COFFEE
CUP IN HIS HAND. WHITE CUP
WITH A BLACK TOP.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.540
OKAY, CUP COFFEE, OKAY,
THAT MEANS HE MUST'VE
STOPPED SOMEWHERE.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.210
WHICH MEANS HE MIGHT BE
LEAVING A TRAIL TO WHERE
HE'S HOLDING THE KIDS.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.760
WHAT'D YOU
FIND OUT ABOUT CROCKER?

08:30.800 --> 08:34.760
KEVIN CROCKER: EX-R.N.C.,
DISAPPEARED 10 YEARS AGO,

08:34.800 --> 08:37.640
CHARGED WITH HOMICIDE,
BUT HE SKIPPED OUT
BEFORE HE WENT TO TRIAL.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.640
-THAT I REMEMBER. -THERE WERE TWO WITNESSES
TO THE MURDER.

08:39.680 --> 08:43.560
THE VICTIM'S DRUG
DEALER BOYFRIEND, AND JAKE.

08:43.600 --> 08:47.320
I WAS YOUR PARTNER.
I WAS YOUR...
I WAS YOUR TEACHER.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.400
I TOOK YOU UNDER MY WING.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.940
YEAH, YOU WERE A REAL
INSPIRATION.

08:49.980 --> 08:51.780
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

08:51.820 --> 08:52.700
PULL UP OVER THERE.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.580
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE
DOING HERE?

09:05.620 --> 09:07.420
THERE'S 20 MILLION BUCKS
IN THERE, AND YOU'RE GONNA
GET ME IN.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.090
YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING US?

09:10.130 --> 09:11.590
&lt;SCOFFS&gt; WELL, I WAS JUST
LOOKING FOR A GOOD TIME
TO SAY "HELLO,"

09:11.630 --> 09:14.180
BUT I HAD NO IDEA IT
WAS GONNA TURN OUT THIS GREAT.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.140
YOU GUYS WORKING
FOR THIS ATM OUTFIT?

09:16.180 --> 09:17.800
THAT'S A STROKE OF GENIUS.

09:17.850 --> 09:22.020
I MEAN, WE TALK OLD TIMES,
I GET RICH. THAT'S PERFECT.

09:22.060 --> 09:25.520
I HATE TO BREAK THIS TO YOU,
BUT THE SECURITY IN THIS PLACE
IS TO THE HILT.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.230
PHONES FIRST.

09:27.270 --> 09:29.770
I CAUGHT THAT CALL
IN THE REAR VIEW, OLD MAN.

09:29.820 --> 09:30.730
DON'T TRY THAT AGAIN.

09:30.780 --> 09:32.780
NOW, I'M GUESSING
YOU'RE AS SMART

09:32.820 --> 09:34.200
AS I'M WILLING
TO GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR,

09:34.240 --> 09:36.410
BUT THAT WASN'T THE COPS
YOU CALLED, NO?

09:36.450 --> 09:38.530
-&lt;BEEPING&gt;
-[CROCKER] THE PLAN'S SIMPLE.

09:38.570 --> 09:40.370
YOU GO IN,
THE MONEY COMES OUT.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.660
I'VE DISABLED THE CAMERAS,
YOU JUST DO WHAT I SAY.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.000
-THIS SEAT TAKEN?
-NO.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.880
PEOPLE SEEM TO BE
GIVING ME A WIDE BERTH.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.960
NEW MAYOR SEEMS NICE.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.670
I'M SORRY ABOUT
HOW THAT WENT EARLIER.

09:54.720 --> 09:55.930
I DIDN'T WANT
ANY PART OF IT.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.590
YOU STOOD UP FOR ME.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.220
YOU KNOW, ONCE THIS
INVESTIGATION IS OVER,

09:59.260 --> 10:00.600
YOU CAN GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.140
LADIES. ON THE HOUSE.

10:03.180 --> 10:04.810
-THANK YOU.
-THAT'S SWEET.

10:04.850 --> 10:06.060
YOU GUYS ARE GOOD
FOR BUSINESS.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.190
CHEERS.

10:07.230 --> 10:08.310
HAVE YOU SEEN
YOUR BROTHER AROUND?

10:08.350 --> 10:09.860
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA
STOP IN ON THIS THING.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.070
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM. SORRY.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.990
CHRISTIAN, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

10:15.030 --> 10:16.320
YEAH, SURE.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.660
[KARLA] MR. DOYLE, JAKE.
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

10:21.700 --> 10:22.700
WHAT BRINGS YOU BACK HERE?

10:22.740 --> 10:26.160
I NEEDED TO, UH, TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.670
WELL, THAT'S GOOD. I WAS
HOPING TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

10:28.710 --> 10:29.670
UM...

10:30.960 --> 10:32.750
THE CHECK YOU GAVE US.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.170
IT BOUNCED.

10:35.210 --> 10:36.840
THE CHECK FROM TODAY?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

10:36.880 --> 10:39.470
YEAH, THE BANK SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT A...

10:40.180 --> 10:41.260
TRANSIT NUMBER OR SOMETHING?

10:41.300 --> 10:43.810
SO, THIS ISN'T AN EXCUSE
TO SEE ME THEN?

10:44.520 --> 10:47.180
NO, NO. THE BANK, UM...

10:47.230 --> 10:48.730
-OKAY.
-I'M SORRY.

10:48.770 --> 10:51.360
I SEE. WELL, UM,
I'LL HAVE THAT FIXED,

10:51.400 --> 10:53.860
AND I JUST NEED
TO DROP BY ACCOUNTING.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.110
OKAY. I GUESS I'LL JUST,
UH, I'LL WAIT HERE...

10:56.150 --> 10:57.820
-&lt;ALARM BLARING&gt;
-AW, CRAP! I'M SORRY!

10:57.860 --> 10:59.860
-IT'S OKAY
-WAS THAT ME?

10:59.910 --> 11:02.410
I JUST HAVE TO CALL
THE COMPANY. FOLLOW ME.

11:02.450 --> 11:03.450
OKAY.

11:07.790 --> 11:11.670
IT'S JUST A FIRE ALARM.
FALSE ALARM, EVERYONE!

11:11.710 --> 11:13.790
KARLA, I'M REALLY, REALLY
SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.800
KARLA GREEN! IT WAS
AN ACCIDENTAL FIRE ALARM.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.800
-I'M ENTERING THE CODE NOW.
-&lt;KEYING IN&gt;

11:19.840 --> 11:21.970
-OKAY?
-&lt;ALARM STOPS&gt;

11:22.010 --> 11:23.640
UH, SORRY.

11:23.680 --> 11:24.850
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT TAKES THEM ABOUT
FIVE MINUTES OR SO

11:24.890 --> 11:26.020
TO RESET THE SYSTEM.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.020
[CROCKER] OKAY, NOBODY MOVE!
WHOOPS! YOU MOVED!

11:30.900 --> 11:32.100
&lt;PEOPLE SCREAMING&gt;

11:32.150 --> 11:34.980
JUST DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD,
AND YOU'LL ALL BE FINE.

11:35.690 --> 11:38.400
YOU. UGLY FELLA.

11:39.450 --> 11:40.860
START BAGGING THE MONEY.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.990
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
TIME TO PUT THE CELL PHONES
IN THE BAG.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.750
NOBODY DIAL 911.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.210
NOW, YOU CAN KEEP
YOUR WALLETS,
THAT'S MY GIFT TO YOU.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.880
EH, THAT'S GOOD WORK THERE,
SIMPLE BOY!

11:52.920 --> 11:56.090
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU MOVE
THESE BAGS OUT TO THAT
BLUE MUSCLE CAR OUT BACK.

11:58.130 --> 11:59.470
IF YOU EVEN
THINK ABOUT RUNNING,

11:59.510 --> 12:00.760
YOU WILL NEVER SEE
TINNY AGAIN.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.470
YOU GOT THAT, RIGHT?

12:05.470 --> 12:07.720
THESE ARE ALL
OF THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSES,

12:07.770 --> 12:10.350
STORAGE BUILDINGS AND GARAGES
WITHIN 10 MINUTES
OF OUR HOUSE.

12:10.390 --> 12:12.650
AND YOU'RE SURE THAT
THEY'RE BEING HELD SOMEWHERE
WITHIN THIS CIRCLE?

12:12.690 --> 12:15.560
WELL, WE KNOW WHEN
CROCKER TOOK THEM BECAUSE
HE WAS ON THE PHONE WITH JAKE,

12:15.610 --> 12:16.900
THEN HE CALLED BACK
10 MINUTES LATER,

12:16.940 --> 12:18.860
SO HE COULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN THEM MUCH FURTHER,

12:18.900 --> 12:20.780
BUT I STILL GOTTA
NARROW THIS DOWN SOMEHOW.

12:21.860 --> 12:23.910
GRAB YOUR COAT,
WE'RE GOING FOR COFFEE.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.370
-IS ANYONE HURT?
-LISTEN, IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,

12:27.410 --> 12:30.160
YOU TAKE THIS MONEY
AND WE USE IT AS RANSOM
FOR THE KIDS.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.410
YOU GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE.

12:33.870 --> 12:36.290
HE'S NOT GONNA LET YOU
WALK BACK OUTTA THERE, JAKE.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.500
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT
THE MONEY. IT'S ABOUT
GETTING BACK AT YOU.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.210
-WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?
-I DON'T KNOW YET.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.800
&lt;ALARM BLARING&gt;

12:44.510 --> 12:46.970
-WATCH YOURSELF.
-JUST GET OUT OF HERE!

12:47.010 --> 12:49.560
OKAY, WHY DID YOU
TRIGGER THE ALARM?

12:49.600 --> 12:50.890
IS IT YOUR MONEY?

12:50.930 --> 12:51.810
DON'T. PLEASE.

12:51.850 --> 12:54.440
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T HIT A WOMAN, SO...

12:54.480 --> 12:56.440
-&lt;GRUNTS&gt;
-&lt;CROWD GASPING&gt;

12:56.480 --> 12:57.940
PLAN B!

12:57.980 --> 13:01.030
-&lt;CROWD GASPING&gt;
-&lt;COINS CLATTERING&gt;

13:01.070 --> 13:02.190
THE COPS ARE ON THEIR WAY.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.990
EVERYONE JUST STAY CALM.

13:04.030 --> 13:05.200
HEY, JAKE, IT'S ME.

13:05.240 --> 13:08.780
SO, I'M GONNA HEAD HOME
SINCE YOU'RE A NO-SHOW.

13:08.830 --> 13:12.330
CAN YOU CALL ME?
I'M NOT PISSED OR ANYTHING,
BUT CAN YOU JUST CALL ME?

13:12.370 --> 13:13.500
OKAY?

13:15.170 --> 13:16.920
-SEE YA.
-SEE YA.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.750
THANKS FOR COMING,
I'M GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT!

13:18.960 --> 13:20.250
OPTICS?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.840
EXACTLY. LOOK, LESLIE,

13:22.880 --> 13:27.140
I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO MAKE
SURE THAT THIS SUSPENSION
PASSES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

13:27.180 --> 13:28.760
YOU'RE A GOOD COP.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.430
YOU KNOW THAT.

13:30.470 --> 13:33.310
WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE NOT A DIRTY COP.

13:33.350 --> 13:35.440
-RIGHT.
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

13:35.480 --> 13:39.860
BUT DON'T HESITATE TO CALL
IF YOU NEED, UM, ANYTHING.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.900
&lt;MULTIPLE CELL PHONES RINGING&gt;

13:41.940 --> 13:45.860
LOOKS BIG. ALARM TRIGGERED
AT A HIGH-SECURITY LOCATION
ACROSS TOWN.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.570
SORRY YOU CAN'T COME, PARTNER.

13:47.620 --> 13:50.660
&lt;CROWD CHATTERING&gt;

13:51.370 --> 13:54.000
DES, LOOK. UP THERE.

13:55.750 --> 13:56.750
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

13:58.170 --> 14:00.460
YEAH, YEAH, I THINK
I CAN GET TO THAT.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.460
ALTHOUGH I WISH
I DIDN'T CUT MY FINGERNAILS
LAST NIGHT.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.170
MAYBE WE SHOULD
BUILD A LADDER.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.260
YEAH. YOU'RE SO SMART.

14:06.300 --> 14:09.220
IT'S ONE OF THE LIKE
400 THINGS THAT
I ADMIRE ABOUT YOU.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.020
DES, I SHOULD
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.980
WHAT? AH, DO I SMELL FUNNY?
I SMELL FUNNY, DON'T I?

14:17.140 --> 14:21.320
NO... NEVER MIND.
LET'S GET THIS DONE, HEY?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.190
GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE
BEFORE THAT CREEP COMES BACK.

14:30.990 --> 14:33.080
HELLO? ANYBODY HOME?

14:33.120 --> 14:35.410
LESLIE! WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

14:35.450 --> 14:37.120
WHAT HAPPENED? YOU OKAY?

14:37.160 --> 14:39.500
OH, NOTHING. I GOT LOCKED OUT.

14:39.540 --> 14:42.040
JAKE KICKED IT IN.
HEH, THE DOOFUS.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.090
DO YOU MIND IF I SIT
WITH YA FOR A SECOND?

14:51.470 --> 14:53.970
WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT HAPPENED?

14:54.010 --> 14:57.060
I WAS, UH, JUST LOOKING...
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR JAKE,

14:57.100 --> 15:01.980
BUT, UH, HE WASN'T
IN THE OFFICE,
AND I WAS HOPING TO SEE HIM.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.110
I SHOULDN'T...
I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.

15:07.150 --> 15:08.860
-DIDN'T MEAN
TO BOTHER YOU.
-YOU CAN TELL ME.

15:10.030 --> 15:11.160
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:12.870 --> 15:14.660
I'M UNDER INVESTIGATION.

15:15.580 --> 15:16.870
FOR CONDUCT

15:16.910 --> 15:18.620
UNBECOMING OF AN OFFICER.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.500
WHAT? THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

15:21.540 --> 15:23.960
THE MAYOR, HIS CORRUPTION,
THEY WANNA KNOW
IF I WAS INVOLVED.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.460
IF I KNEW ANYTHING...

15:27.510 --> 15:29.630
&lt;SNIFFLES&gt;

15:32.010 --> 15:33.260
IT'S OKAY, SWEETHEART.

15:38.180 --> 15:40.440
I'M IN LOVE WITH JAKE,
YOU KNOW THAT, DON'T YA?

15:42.520 --> 15:43.650
YEP.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.490
AND HE LOVES YOU, TOO,
I'D LAY MONEY ON IT.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.110
AND I'M SURE,
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,

15:50.150 --> 15:53.570
WHEN YOU'RE BOTH
A LITTLE STEADIER, READY,

15:54.870 --> 15:56.240
YOU'LL FIND EACH OTHER.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.250
MAYBE.

15:59.410 --> 16:01.790
LESLIE, DON'T WAIT TOO LONG.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.040
YOU MIGHT JUST
MISS YOUR CHANCE.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.790
AND I WOULD HATE
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE

16:05.840 --> 16:08.800
THERE'S NO ONE IN THE WORLD
I'D RATHER SEE MY BOY WITH
THAN YOU.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.180
I APPRECIATE IT, MALACHY.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.730
BY THE WAY, WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE HOCKEY GEAR?

16:23.770 --> 16:26.820
OH, THAT?
JOINING A BEER LEAGUE.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.040
[TARRANT] MR. DOYLE,

16:41.080 --> 16:44.120
YOU ACCIDENTALLY
SET OFF THE ALARM,

16:44.170 --> 16:47.500
CROCKER USES THAT
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET IN
WITHOUT ALERTING THE POLICE,

16:47.540 --> 16:51.220
TRIES TO ROB THE PLACE,
BUT YOU INCAPACITATE HIM.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.180
I KNOW.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.090
RIGHT PLACE, WRONG TIME,
I SUPPOSE.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.760
UNFORTUNATELY,
YOUR HEROICS COME

16:57.810 --> 17:02.390
AFTER YOU'VE LOADED
$5 MILLION IN CASH

17:02.430 --> 17:04.520
INTO HIS WHEELMAN'S
GETAWAY CAR.

17:04.560 --> 17:09.150
NOW, YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN
TO GET A GOOD LOOK
AT THAT FELLOW, DID YOU?

17:09.190 --> 17:11.740
NO, NO, NO.
HE WAS WEARING A MASK.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.820
OF COURSE HE WAS!

17:13.860 --> 17:15.160
AND THE CAMERA'S DISABLED.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.870
HOW ARE YOU WITH ELECTRONICS?

17:16.910 --> 17:19.080
WELL, I'M NOT GREAT
AT PROGRAMMING THE VCR,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

17:19.120 --> 17:20.120
&lt;SCOFFS&gt;

17:21.830 --> 17:23.210
I WANT THIS GUY CROCKER.

17:23.250 --> 17:27.080
HE'S A BAD COP ON THE RUN
FROM MURDER CHARGES
FOR 10 YEARS.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.840
WHAT'RE YOU NOT
TELLING ME, JAKE?

17:29.880 --> 17:32.090
-AM I A SUSPECT, OR...
-SHOULD YOU BE?

17:33.670 --> 17:35.630
WELL, LIKE YOU SAID,
I CAUGHT THE GUY, SO...

17:37.260 --> 17:41.270
YOUR EX-PARTNER. WELL,
IT'LL BE INTERESTING GETTING
HIS TAKE ON THINGS.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.270
AM I FREE TO GO HERE?

17:42.310 --> 17:46.190
YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM ME.
YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT.

17:51.650 --> 17:55.030
[CHRISTIAN] UH, SO WE'VE
HIT FIVE COFFEE SHOPS ALREADY.

17:55.070 --> 17:56.700
HEY, WHAT'D DAD SAY
THAT CUP LOOKED LIKE AGAIN?

17:56.740 --> 17:58.490
UH, WHITE CUP, BLACK TOP.

17:58.530 --> 18:00.620
[CHRISTIAN] &lt;SARCASTICALLY&gt;
YEAH, THAT'S SPECIFIC ENOUGH.

18:00.660 --> 18:05.250
-CAN I HELP YOU?
-I'LL HAVE 53 DOUBLE
CAPPUCCINOS TO GO.

18:05.290 --> 18:07.040
OKAY, I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

18:08.330 --> 18:10.040
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
IN THE BACK SO I CAN DOWNLOAD

18:10.090 --> 18:12.090
SOME MATERIAL
OFF THAT SECURITY CAMERA.

18:12.130 --> 18:14.420
UH, I'M NOT REALLY
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

18:14.460 --> 18:18.220
OUT OF MY WAY, LITTLE MAN.
I HAVE NOT GOT ALL DAY!

18:19.260 --> 18:20.260
YOU COMING?

18:21.350 --> 18:23.390
YOU SHOULD HURRY.

18:23.430 --> 18:28.230
HOW IS OUR PLUCKY
LITTLE P.I. CONNECTED
TO ALL THIS?

18:30.360 --> 18:31.230
[TARRANT] WHAT'S THIS?

18:31.270 --> 18:33.190
CROCKER COLLECTED
ALL THEIR PHONES.

18:36.950 --> 18:37.990
LOOK AT THAT!

18:38.860 --> 18:40.530
MALACHY DOYLE.

18:40.570 --> 18:42.280
HE WASN'T EVEN
AT THE WAREHOUSE.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.790
I THOUGHT THEY'D BOOK YA.

18:47.830 --> 18:49.540
NO, NO, NO. THEY DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING ON ME,
BUT THEY'VE GOT CROCKER.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.670
-WHERE'S THE MONEY?
-STASHED IN THE BASEMENT.

18:52.710 --> 18:54.590
LESLIE WAS HERE.
SHE ALMOST CAUGHT ME!

18:54.630 --> 18:56.590
WHOA, WHAT WAS LESLIE
DOING HERE?

18:56.630 --> 18:58.090
SHE WAS SUSPENDED TODAY.

18:58.130 --> 19:00.890
ARGH! WHAT ABOUT ROSE?
ANY LUCK TRACKING THE KIDS?

19:00.930 --> 19:03.560
SHE'S TRYING TO
NARROW IT DOWN,
BUT NOTHING DEFINITIVE SO FAR.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.560
THERE'S NO WAY THIS GUY'S
GONNA TELL US WHERE
TINNY AND DES ARE,

19:05.600 --> 19:07.940
NOT FROM JAIL, AND NOT
WHEN WE'VE GOT HIS MONEY.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.770
I KNOW, DAD. THAT'S WHY
WE GOTTA CALL IN SOME FAVORS.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.230
THERE IS A WHEELMAN
OUT THERE WITH $5 MILLION.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.650
I WOULD SO LIKE TO KNOW
WHO THAT GUY IS.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.910
IS THAT A DEAL
I SMELL COOKING?

19:19.950 --> 19:22.660
LET'S START WITH
WHY DO YOU HAVE
MALACHY DOYLE'S CELL PHONE?

19:22.700 --> 19:23.910
HE WASN'T IN THE ROBBERY.

19:23.950 --> 19:25.740
WELL, I AM A THIEF, YOU KNOW.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.330
-AND A MURDERER.
-NEVER BEEN CONVICTED.

19:27.370 --> 19:29.830
YEAH, WELL, YOU SAW TO THAT
WHEN YOU SKIPPED TOWN
BEFORE IT WENT TO TRIAL,

19:29.870 --> 19:32.630
BUT I REALLY DO WANT TO HEAR
YOUR SIDE OF THINGS.

19:32.670 --> 19:34.590
WHO PUT YOU UP
TO THIS LITTLE HEIST?

19:34.630 --> 19:39.840
WELL, I COULD TELL YOU
A STORY, SO IF YOU'RE TALKING
DEAL, WELL, I'M LISTENING.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.180
EXCUSE ME, I'D LIKE
TO HAVE A WORD
WITH MY CLIENT, PLEASE.

19:42.220 --> 19:43.350
YOUR CLIENT?

19:43.390 --> 19:45.890
YES. SURE.

19:45.930 --> 19:48.560
THE TUBBY GUY THERE?
THAT'S MY LAWYER.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

19:48.600 --> 19:50.140
-WALTER.
-WALTER!

19:50.190 --> 19:51.520
YEAH, IF YOU COULD
EXCUSE US, PLEASE?

19:55.150 --> 19:57.150
HEY, WALLY!

19:57.190 --> 19:59.360
LET'S NOT GET TOO CHUMMY.
I'M JUST THE MESSENGER HERE.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.990
JAKE DOYLE WANTS TINNY
AND DES' LOCATION,

20:02.030 --> 20:03.320
AND THEN YOU CAN
HAVE YOUR MONEY.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.990
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

20:07.040 --> 20:10.250
ALL RIGHT, LOOK. YOU TELL
JAKE DOYLE THAT IF HE WANTS
TO SEE HIS NIECE ALIVE,

20:10.290 --> 20:11.620
HE HAS ABOUT ONE OPTION.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.500
BREAK ME OUTTA HERE.

20:14.540 --> 20:16.250
DID YOU GET THAT?

20:16.290 --> 20:17.750
TELL HIM HE'S GOT A DEAL.

20:20.340 --> 20:21.550
[ROSE] HEY, YOU GUYS, LOOK!
CHECK THIS OUT.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.260
[MAL] IT'S CROCKER!
[ROSE] YEAH.

20:24.300 --> 20:27.260
SO, HE GRABBED THE KIDS
FROM OUR HOUSE,

20:27.310 --> 20:31.020
AND THEN HE STOPPED HERE
TO GET A COFFEE
BEFORE HE WENT TO THE BATTERY,

20:31.060 --> 20:32.520
SO HE'S GOT THEM
SOMEWHERE HERE.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.560
HE TOOK OUR WAREHOUSES
FROM 100 TO 7.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.900
I CAN GO TO EACH ONE OF THEM.

20:35.940 --> 20:37.270
GREAT. YOU STAY ON THAT.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.110
IF YOU FIND THE KIDS FIRST,
WE CALL IT OFF.

20:40.150 --> 20:42.240
OTHERWISE WE STICK
TO THE PLAN.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.910
OR AT LEAST I DO.

20:43.950 --> 20:45.200
WE'LL HAVE TO SNATCH HIM
WHEN THEY MOVE HIM

20:45.240 --> 20:46.410
TO THE COURTHOUSE
FOR THE ARRAIGNMENT.

20:46.450 --> 20:48.120
YOU NEED TO KNOW
WHEN THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.910
I'M ON IT.

20:49.950 --> 20:51.580
[TARRANT] KNOCK, KNOCK!

20:53.710 --> 20:57.130
I GUESS THIS TIME I LEAVE
IN A SET OF BRACELETS, WHAT?

20:58.960 --> 21:01.210
MALACHY DOYLE,
WOULD YOU MIND
HAVING A LITTLE CHAT?

21:01.800 --> 21:03.430
DOWN AT THE STATION.

21:03.470 --> 21:04.630
[ROSE] MAL?

21:04.680 --> 21:07.680
IT'S OKAY. DO WHAT NEEDS
TO BE DONE.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.640
-SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING!
-&lt;ROSE SCOFFS&gt;

21:13.770 --> 21:16.650
&lt;SIGHS&gt; YOU TWO,
FIND THE WAREHOUSES,

21:16.690 --> 21:18.270
ALL RIGHT? I'LL GO
AFTER CROCKER.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.520
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

21:19.570 --> 21:22.360
FINE. JUST CALL US
IF YOU FIND THEM, OKAY?

21:22.400 --> 21:23.650
[ROSE] OKAY.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.450
-HEY.
-HI, ALLISON,
I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

21:26.490 --> 21:28.080
WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.740
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU ALL DAY.

21:29.790 --> 21:33.370
YEAH, UH, I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD'VE GOT BACK TO YOU.
IT'S JUST...

21:33.410 --> 21:36.670
-I CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW.
-JAKE, LOOK, THIS ISN'T
ABOUT ME BEING CLINGY.

21:36.710 --> 21:39.540
I JUST THINK THAT I DESERVE
AN EXPLANATION

21:39.590 --> 21:41.130
AS TO WHY YOU'VE
BEEN IGNORING ME.

21:41.170 --> 21:42.300
I'M NOT IGNORING YOU!

21:42.340 --> 21:44.340
WE'RE JUST...

21:44.380 --> 21:47.180
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING PRETTY BIG HERE,
AND I CAN'T GET INTO IT.

21:47.220 --> 21:48.720
WELL, THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.390
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

21:50.430 --> 21:52.810
I'M SORRY, ALLISON,
BUT I CAN'T HAVE THIS
CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW.

21:53.850 --> 21:55.270
CHRISTIAN, LET'S GO.

21:58.610 --> 22:01.360
UM, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.860
YES, IT IS, I THINK.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.700
UNFORTUNATELY.

22:10.740 --> 22:13.870
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S THE LAST
ONE, SO I'LL HEAD UP.

22:13.910 --> 22:15.370
IT'S GONNA BE FINE,
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

22:15.410 --> 22:16.540
I'M GONNA GET US
OUTTA HERE, OKAY?

22:16.580 --> 22:19.580
I'M LIGHTER, AND A
LITTLE LESS SPAZ-LIKE.

22:19.630 --> 22:20.750
NO, NO, NO! NO, NO...

22:20.790 --> 22:22.590
-&lt;GLASS BREAKING&gt;
-LOOK, I HAVE A JOB HERE,

22:22.630 --> 22:25.420
OKAY? TO HELP YOU,
FOR YOU. OKAY?

22:25.470 --> 22:28.760
OKAY! FINE. YOU CAN SAVE ME.

22:29.390 --> 22:30.600
GO AHEAD!

22:30.640 --> 22:34.140
OKAY. AND TINNY, I WANT
YOU TO KNOW THAT
IF THINGS GET WORSE,

22:34.180 --> 22:36.940
I DON'T WANT YOU TO STARVE,
SO IF YOU HAVE TO,
YOU CAN EAT MY CORPSE,

22:36.980 --> 22:38.100
-OKAY?
-SHUT UP.

22:38.980 --> 22:40.230
NOW I'LL JUST...

22:40.270 --> 22:41.690
I'LL GET US OUT OF HERE.

22:41.730 --> 22:43.150
I'M GOING TO LONDON.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.780
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU.
I WANTED TO,

22:48.700 --> 22:52.990
BUT... ANYWAY, I'M GOING.

22:53.620 --> 22:55.290
WHY?

22:55.330 --> 22:58.420
POPPY SAID HE'S GOT
ENOUGH MONEY, AND I GET TO GO
FOR A YEAR.

22:58.460 --> 23:02.090
A YEAR? LIKE A WHOLE YEAR?

23:02.130 --> 23:04.460
-I WAS GONNA TELL...
-NO, NO, NO, IT'S FINE.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.090
IT'S FINE. THAT'S...

23:06.970 --> 23:08.380
I BET IT'S A GOOD SCHOOL.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.970
-DES...
-NO, NO.

23:10.010 --> 23:12.300
I'M HAPPY. REALLY.

23:12.350 --> 23:15.970
SO, I'LL JUST GET
US OUT OF HERE,
SO YOU CAN GO.

23:19.770 --> 23:21.270
CAREFUL.

23:21.310 --> 23:22.310
&lt;CREAKING&gt;

23:25.440 --> 23:27.360
UH. AH! AH!

23:27.400 --> 23:29.570
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
IS IT OKAY?

23:29.610 --> 23:30.860
I THINK IT'S BROKEN!

23:30.910 --> 23:32.990
I THINK IT'S BROKEN. AH!

23:33.030 --> 23:35.620
TEN YEARS AGO,
CROCKER KILLED A GIRL

23:35.660 --> 23:38.500
IN FRONT OF HER DRUG-DEALING
BOYFRIEND AND ANOTHER COP.

23:38.540 --> 23:41.500
BUT I READ AN
INTERESTING OBITUARY
FROM LAST WEEK.

23:41.540 --> 23:43.210
THE DRUG-DEALING
WITNESS IS DEAD.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.090
THAT'S FASCINATING.

23:45.130 --> 23:46.510
WHAT'S IT HAVE TO DO WITH ME?

23:46.550 --> 23:48.920
THAT'S ONE WITNESS DOWN,
ONLY ONE TO GO.

23:49.510 --> 23:51.680
YOUR SON?

23:51.720 --> 23:56.180
NOW, JAKE IS SUDDENLY AT THE
SCENE OF CROCKER'S LATEST
CRIMINAL ENDEAVOR,

23:56.220 --> 23:57.720
AND YOUR CELL PHONE

23:57.770 --> 24:01.650
TURNS UP IN THE EVIDENCE BOX,
BUT YOU SAY

24:01.690 --> 24:03.650
THAT YOU WERE AT HOME

24:03.690 --> 24:05.400
CLEANING THE KITCHEN.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.780
I'VE BECOME A BIT MORE
DOMESTIC IN THE LAST
FEW MONTHS.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.570
PLACE WAS A STY.

24:11.740 --> 24:16.540
WHY WOULD CROCKER HAVE
YOUR CELL PHONE ON HIM WHEN
WE PICKED HIM UP?

24:16.580 --> 24:18.450
JAKE LIKES TO CALL
THE SEX LINES,

24:18.500 --> 24:19.540
EXPECTS ME TO PAY FOR IT.

24:19.580 --> 24:20.660
MUST'VE COME OUT
OF HIS POCKET.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.040
DOES THAT LOOK FAMILIAR?

24:25.090 --> 24:27.500
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MORE
FOR CURLING MYSELF.

24:27.550 --> 24:28.590
WISH I COULD HELP YA.

24:30.050 --> 24:31.470
I BET YOU DO.

24:32.550 --> 24:33.970
I BET YOU DO.

24:36.010 --> 24:37.390
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING
FROM INTERROGATION ROOM)

24:37.430 --> 24:38.600
YOU'VE MISSED ME, HAVEN'T YA?

24:39.720 --> 24:41.180
JUST CLEARING OUT MY LOCKER.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.600
BENNETT, IT'S ONLY AN
ACTIVE DUTY SUSPENSION.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.770
YOU DON'T NEED
TO CLEAR OUR YOUR LOCKER.

24:43.810 --> 24:45.690
WHAT'S TARRANT DOING
GRILLING MAL?

24:45.730 --> 24:48.280
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT DOING
YOURSELF ANY FAVORS
BY BEING HERE.

24:49.110 --> 24:50.780
WHERE'D THAT HOCKEY BAG
COME FROM?

24:50.820 --> 24:52.450
CROCKER USED IT TO STUFF
THE MONEY IN

24:52.490 --> 24:54.410
-WITH THE CASH WAREHOUSE JOB.
-CROCKER?

24:54.450 --> 24:57.120
KEVIN CROCKER.
JAKE'S OLD PARTNER.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.490
THINGS, THEY DON'T
LOOK GOOD HERE.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.250
[JAKE] LOOK, WALTER,
I WOULDN'T ASK IF I HAD
ANY OTHER CHOICES.

25:04.290 --> 25:05.790
I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.

25:05.830 --> 25:07.090
LOOK, IF I KNEW WHERE
THEY WERE
TRANSPORTING CROCKER,

25:07.130 --> 25:08.460
I'D TELL YOU,
YOU KNOW I WOULD.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.550
ONLY COPS GET THAT
KIND OF INFO.

25:10.590 --> 25:12.260
I'M GONNA KEEP TRYING.

25:12.300 --> 25:15.050
NO, IT'S FINE, DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT, BUDDY.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.680
&lt;SIGHING&gt;

25:19.720 --> 25:21.270
I'M SORRY, LESLIE.

25:33.190 --> 25:38.030
[PROSTITUTE] THIS IS
SERGEANT BENNETT,

25:38.070 --> 25:40.700

25:40.740 --> 25:42.000
AND THE... AND THE ROUTE.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.370
SHE'S LOOKIN' IT UP.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.710
HERE.

25:47.790 --> 25:50.340
ANOTHER 50 AND I
CAN PRETEND TO BE A COP
IN PRIVATE.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.720
NO, I'M... I'M GOOD, THANKS.

25:56.970 --> 25:58.300
WE'RE REALLY GONNA DO THIS?

25:58.350 --> 25:59.970
WHAT CHOICE TO WE HAVE?

26:01.220 --> 26:02.720
LET'S JUST HOPE THAT
ROSE FINDS THEM

26:02.770 --> 26:04.680
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
GO ON, GET IN.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.040
[HOOD] WE GOT A NICE WARM ROOM

26:26.080 --> 26:28.710

MAJESTY'S HOTEL.

26:28.750 --> 26:29.830

26:50.690 --> 26:52.520

26:53.900 --> 26:54.780
RIGHT.

26:54.820 --> 26:56.320
DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID, JAKE.

26:56.360 --> 26:57.570
I WILL FIND THEM.

26:57.610 --> 26:59.740
-SORRY, ROSE. I CAN'T RISK IT. -NO, JAKE, I...

28:00.260 --> 28:01.760
[CHRISTIAN] C'MON! LET'S GO!

28:21.490 --> 28:22.950
[JAKE] WHERE'S MY NIECE?

28:22.990 --> 28:24.240
YOU SEEM KIND OF AGITATED.

28:24.280 --> 28:25.530
I DUNNO, WAS IT
SOMETHING I SAID, OR...

28:28.950 --> 28:30.250
TELL ME

28:30.290 --> 28:31.960
WHERE SHE IS OR
I'LL KILL YA!

28:32.000 --> 28:35.590
THE THING IS, IF YOU KILL ME,
YOU'LL NEVER FIND HER.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.130
LADS, NOW LOOK, YOU GOT
VERY LITTLE TIME LEFT.

28:38.170 --> 28:41.260
YOU GOT EVEN
LESS NEGOTIATING POWER.

28:41.300 --> 28:44.970
YOU GET ME THE MONEY,
YOU GET THE BRATS.
IT'S SIMPLE.

28:45.010 --> 28:47.890
YOU BRING ME TO WHERE
SHE IS, I SEE SHE'S OKAY,

28:47.930 --> 28:50.060
THEN CHRISTIAN WILL BRING YOU
THE MONEY.

28:50.100 --> 28:53.810
BUDDY, HOW BOUT YOU
LET ME WORK OUT THE DETAILS?

28:53.850 --> 28:55.270
YOUR BROTHER STAYS WITH ME,

28:55.310 --> 28:56.690
YOU GO GET THE MONEY.

29:01.820 --> 29:02.950
NO WAY.

29:05.780 --> 29:06.870
LET'S DO WHAT HE SAYS, JAKE.

29:06.910 --> 29:08.830
NO.

29:08.870 --> 29:11.620
HEY, HE'S ALWAYS... HE'S SUCH
A CONTROL FREAK.

29:12.460 --> 29:13.960
GIVE ME THE FIREARM.

29:16.630 --> 29:18.670

OR YOUR NIECE WILL ROT.

29:23.010 --> 29:24.430
I'LL CALL YA. HURRY.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.890
I THINK YOUR BROTHER'S

29:33.600 --> 29:35.020
LET'S JUST DO THIS, EH?

29:37.650 --> 29:39.980
[DES] ARE YOU SURE I SHOULDN'T
EAT ANY OF THE SALT BEEF?

29:40.820 --> 29:42.530
WE DON'T HAVE ANY WATER,

29:42.570 --> 29:45.660
SO I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD EAT
20-YEAR-OLD SALT BEEF.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.870
SAVE YOUR ENERGY.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.370
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE TO
MOVE TO LONDON?

29:48.410 --> 29:52.200
BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO FAR AWAY,
YOU KNOW?

29:53.410 --> 29:55.080
LIKE, CORNER BROOK IS CLOSE.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.420
ST. JOHN'S IS EVEN CLOSER.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.880
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; WE
LIVE IN ST. JOHN'S.

30:00.920 --> 30:04.630
AND GOING FAR AWAY
IS KINDA THE IDEA.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.800
I GUESS I WAS JUST...

30:06.840 --> 30:09.180
I GUESS I WAS JUST SURPRISED,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE

30:10.470 --> 30:14.100
LONDON, ENGLAND IS
LIKE IN ENGLAND...

30:14.140 --> 30:16.850
(SOFTLY) WHICH IS NOT
EVEN NORTH AMERICA.

30:16.890 --> 30:19.650
AND NO ONE WILL BE THERE
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

30:19.690 --> 30:21.020
&lt;TINNY TAKES DEEP BREATH&gt;

30:23.230 --> 30:26.110
IS IT ME? BECAUSE I COULD MOVE
TO LONDON AND YOU COULD STAY
IF YOU WANT.

30:26.150 --> 30:29.280
NO! IT'S NOT YOU.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.740
I NEED TO GO FOR ME.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.370
I'M SORRY, BUT I DO.

30:36.410 --> 30:39.000
I DUNNO, TINNY, I JUST...

30:39.040 --> 30:40.590
-I JUST, FEEL LIKE...
-IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.000
I KNOW.

30:44.420 --> 30:45.970
I FEEL IT, TOO.

30:48.220 --> 30:49.680
[TARRANT] LOOK, I LIKE JAKE.

30:49.720 --> 30:51.050
I THINK HE HAS WONDERFUL

30:51.100 --> 30:53.100
POTENTIAL AND ABILITY.

30:53.140 --> 30:54.390
BUT IF HE IS INVOLVED,

30:54.430 --> 30:55.770
HE WILL HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT

30:55.810 --> 30:58.020
-FUTURE THAN I WOULD'VE
HOPED FOR THE BOY.
-REALLY?

30:58.060 --> 30:59.270
A DIFFERENT FUTURE FOR
YOU, TOO.

30:59.310 --> 31:01.310
MY FUTURE IS NOT IN MY OWN
HANDS RIGHT NOW,

31:01.360 --> 31:03.070
AND I'D KILL SOMEONE
TO CHANGE THAT.

31:03.110 --> 31:04.570
&lt;KNOCKING ON DOOR&gt;

31:04.610 --> 31:06.900
WHO'S THAT, YOUR LAWYER?

31:06.940 --> 31:09.030
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A WORD
WITH MY HUSBAND ALONE.

31:09.070 --> 31:12.660
MAYBE TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HIM.
IT'S TIME TO FACE REALITY.

31:14.410 --> 31:17.040
FINE. FINE!

31:17.080 --> 31:19.330
I JUST HOPE THAT YOU ARE
A DOYLE WHO CAN SEE REASON.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.880
-DID YOU FIND THEM?
-NOT YET, BUT I KNOW HOW
WE WILL.

31:28.130 --> 31:29.340
CONROY.

31:29.380 --> 31:31.590
DAN, WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
YOU COULD LOSE YOUR
JOB FOR THIS!

31:31.640 --> 31:33.970
ROSE FILLED ME IN.

31:34.010 --> 31:35.890
I'D RATHER DO A LITTLE MORE
MOOSE HUNTING ANYWAY.

31:36.970 --> 31:38.560
-I LEAVE YOU TO IT.
-&lt;CELL PHONE DIALING&gt;

31:38.600 --> 31:40.020
-THANKS, MAN.
-[ROSE] THANK YOU.

31:40.060 --> 31:42.150
-[MAL] WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
-OKAY, THIS IS
CROCKER'S PHONE.

31:42.190 --> 31:44.940
THE LINK TO THE LIVE FEED
WILL STILL BE IN ITS HISTORY.
LOOK.

31:44.980 --> 31:47.110
OH, MY GOD, MAL!
DES IS HURT!

31:47.150 --> 31:49.150
LOOKS BAD. WORSE THAN BEFORE.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.530
WHAT'S THAT IN THE FOREGROUND?

31:50.570 --> 31:51.820
IS THAT A BEEF BUCKET?

31:51.860 --> 31:53.160
I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T
READ THE LABEL.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.950
I RECOGNIZE IT. IT SAYS
"TRIMMED NAVAL BEEF."

31:55.990 --> 31:58.450
-THAT COMPANY WENT
UNDER YEARS AGO.
-&lt;SIGHING&gt;

31:58.500 --> 32:00.420
THERE'S AN OLD PACKING
PLANT DOWN ON WATER STREET.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.710
THAT'S THE PLACE!

32:03.040 --> 32:04.840
-CHECKING IT OUT.
-GO!

32:06.170 --> 32:07.460
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

32:10.510 --> 32:12.010
&lt;JAKE SIGHS&gt;

32:12.050 --> 32:14.850
LESLIE, YOUR TIMING
FOR HIDING IN MY LIVING ROOM

32:14.890 --> 32:17.930
AND POINTING A GUN AT
ME COULDN'T BE WORSE
IF YOU TRIED.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.140
THIS IS NOT A JOKE, JAKE.
YOU'RE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.850
I CAN SEE THAT.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.650
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

32:25.690 --> 32:27.570
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE SUSPENDED.

32:27.610 --> 32:29.740
ON YOUR KNEES, NOW.

32:29.780 --> 32:31.320
LESLIE, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

32:36.530 --> 32:38.120
TINNY AND DES
HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED.

32:39.370 --> 32:40.580
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:40.620 --> 32:42.120
AND I'VE ONLY GOT A FEW
HOURS TO GET 'EM BACK.

32:42.170 --> 32:44.130
JAKE, THIS IS CRAZY.
ARE YOU TELLING ME THE TRUTH?

32:44.170 --> 32:45.790
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF
TINNY'S STILL ALIVE,

32:47.210 --> 32:49.840
BUT I AM GOING TO FIND HER.
I HAVE TO.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.170
AND IF THE COPS ARE INVOLVED,

32:52.680 --> 32:55.680
THIS GUY... HE'LL KILL HER,

32:55.720 --> 32:58.220
AND TRUST ME, I KNOW HIM.

32:58.260 --> 33:00.020
HE'LL DO IT.

33:00.060 --> 33:02.310
THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO
FIX THIS, JAKE.

33:03.770 --> 33:05.060
I'M MAKING YOU COME WITH ME.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.820
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

33:38.180 --> 33:39.310
I LOVE YOU.

33:45.060 --> 33:46.440
YOU CAN SHOOT
ME LATER IF YOU WANT.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.240
&lt;SOFT CHUCKLE&gt;

34:05.580 --> 34:06.790
[ROSE] TINNY?

34:07.420 --> 34:08.460
&lt;POUNDING ON WOOD&gt;

34:11.460 --> 34:13.090
ROSE!

34:13.130 --> 34:15.090
OH, MY GOD! YOU GUYS!

34:15.130 --> 34:16.840
OH, MY GOD! ARE YOU OKAY?

34:24.310 --> 34:26.140
[CROCKER] HEY-HEY, HERO!

34:26.190 --> 34:28.020
I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU WERE GONNA
SHOW UP!

34:29.610 --> 34:30.690
DROP THE CASH.

34:31.980 --> 34:33.940
WE BOTH KNOW THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH CASH.

34:35.190 --> 34:36.650
IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
10 YEARS AGO.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.280
WELL, IT'S ABOUT BOTH, REALLY.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.410
YOU ALL RIGHT?

34:39.450 --> 34:40.580
I'M FINE.

34:40.620 --> 34:41.660
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

34:44.330 --> 34:45.410
WAS THAT NECESSARY?

34:45.450 --> 34:47.330
I AM SORRY ABOUT THAT.

34:47.370 --> 34:49.750
AND NOW THE TIME HAS COME
TO PUT THE PAST IN THE PAST,

34:49.790 --> 34:54.300
AND IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO PUT A BULLET
THROUGH YOUR BRAIN.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.300
MONEY!

35:01.350 --> 35:03.140
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE BLAMING ME FOR THIS.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.100
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

35:06.770 --> 35:08.140
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO KILLED THAT GIRL.

35:09.850 --> 35:11.480
THAT WAS YOUR DECISION
ALL ON YOUR OWN.

35:11.520 --> 35:12.980
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT TURNED ME IN.

35:14.480 --> 35:19.110
YOU TURNED ME IN FOR A JUNKIE.

35:19.160 --> 35:23.030
SHE WAS NOTHING.
I DID THIS TOWN A
FAVOR WHEN I KILLED HER.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.700
YOU KEEP TELLING YOURSELF
THAT, CROCKER.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.660
YOU'RE A PIECE OF CRAP,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.670
YOU WERE TAKING MONEY
FROM DRUG DEALERS, MAN.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.250
YOU'RE A CROOK. YOU WERE
THE BIGGEST CROOK IN TOWN.

35:31.290 --> 35:33.460
OOH, AND YOU'RE THE BIG HERO.

35:33.500 --> 35:34.920
BRINGING DOWN THE MAYOR.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.300
GETTING HIS PICTURE IN
THE PAPER.

35:36.340 --> 35:37.590
SAVING THE CITIZENRY.

35:37.630 --> 35:39.930
YOU WANNA KILL ME BECAUSE
I GOT MY PICTURE IN THE PAPER?

35:39.970 --> 35:42.260
NO. I WANTED TO KILL
YOU FOR A LONG TIME.

35:42.300 --> 35:44.140
I JUST NEEDED SOMETHING TO GET
ME OFF THE COUCH.

35:44.180 --> 35:46.350
YOU KNOW, LAST LITTLE PUSH.

35:46.390 --> 35:47.890
-WHAT NOW?
-WELL,

35:47.930 --> 35:49.270
I'M GONNA TAKE THE MONEY,

35:49.310 --> 35:51.270
I'M GONNA BE GONE.
AND AS FOR YOU...

35:52.560 --> 35:53.940
I THINK I CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

35:53.980 --> 35:56.570
AH! GOD, WHAT IS THAT?

35:56.610 --> 36:00.030
MACE? WHAT ARE YOU, A GIRL?

36:03.370 --> 36:04.330
ASSHOLE!

36:05.530 --> 36:06.830
[LESLIE] HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

36:09.460 --> 36:10.620
HE'S OUT COLD.

36:10.670 --> 36:12.000
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.290
YOU'RE LUCKY WE CAME AT ALL.

36:13.330 --> 36:14.960
&lt;GROANING&gt;

36:15.000 --> 36:16.340
NICE IDEA, BENNETT.

36:16.380 --> 36:18.760
FOLLOW JAKE DOYLE,
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.260
&lt;CLICKS TONGUE&gt; GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

36:21.130 --> 36:22.340
BENNETT.

36:23.430 --> 36:24.680
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST,
JAKE DOYLE.

36:25.260 --> 36:26.260
OOH.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.520
YOU'RE ARRESTING ME?

36:28.560 --> 36:30.430
ARMED ROBBERY IS
ARMED ROBBERY.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.440
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR
EXCUSES DOWN AT THE STATION.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.310
-&lt;EXHALES&gt;
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

36:36.440 --> 36:39.900
UM, LESLIE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ANSWER
THAT PHONE.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.660
IT'S, UM...

36:45.030 --> 36:46.200
IT'S IN MY FRONT POCKET.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.200
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DIG FOR IT.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.960
-&lt;CELL PHONE BEEPS&gt;
-JAKE DOYLE'S PHONE.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.090
THANK YOU.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.380
DES AND TINNY ARE SAFE.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.720
THANK YOU.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.390
YOU CAN SHOOT
ME NOW IF YOU WANT TO.

37:07.220 --> 37:08.680
DON'T TEMPT ME.

37:08.720 --> 37:09.930
[HOOD] COME ON, DOYLE.

37:11.350 --> 37:12.520
COME ON.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.810
TAKE IT EASY.

37:18.650 --> 37:21.240
WELL, IT'S BEEN QUITE
AN EVENTFUL DAY FOR YOU.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.030
FOILED AN ARMED ROBBERY,
RECOVERED THE STOLEN MONEY,

37:24.070 --> 37:25.450
TOOK DOWN A FUGITIVE.

37:25.490 --> 37:27.450
WELL, YOU CAN GET A LOT
DONE WHEN YOU'RE MOTIVATED.

37:27.490 --> 37:28.700
YOU KNOW THAT, UH,

37:29.790 --> 37:32.250
I CAN'T CHARGE YOU
WITH ANY CRIME.

37:32.290 --> 37:36.170
THERE'S NO HARD EVIDENCE.
YOU PULLED THIS OFF PERFECTLY.

37:36.210 --> 37:38.380
ACCUSATIONS ARE CERTAINLY
NOT APPRECIATED.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.420
SO... &lt;CLAPS&gt;

37:41.460 --> 37:43.300
-AM I GOOD TO GO HERE, OR...
-SURE!

37:43.340 --> 37:45.010
TOO BAD YOUR FATHER ISN'T.
-WHAT?

37:45.050 --> 37:47.800
WELL, YOU I HAVE
NOTHING ON, BUT MALACHY?

37:47.850 --> 37:50.310
I THINK I COULD BUILD A PRETTY
COMPELLING CASE.

37:50.350 --> 37:51.470
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

37:54.810 --> 37:56.020
IS THIS A JOKE?

37:56.060 --> 37:58.270
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK SO,
BUT I'M DEADLY SERIOUS.

37:58.310 --> 38:00.820
ST. JOHN'S IS MOVING
TOWARDS MAJOR ORGANIZED CRIME.

38:00.860 --> 38:02.780
THE R.N.C.'S WELL
ON TOP OF IT,

38:02.820 --> 38:06.160
BUT I'M STARTING UP A SPECIAL
TASK FORCE,

38:06.200 --> 38:07.490
AND I WANT YOU TO HEAD IT.

38:11.540 --> 38:12.620
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

38:12.660 --> 38:14.500
AH, NO, YOU DON'T GET IT.

38:14.540 --> 38:17.750
THIS IS NOT AN OFFER.
IT'S AN ULTIMATUM.

38:17.790 --> 38:21.130
EITHER YOU PAY
FOR YOUR ACTIONS
BY HELPING ME, OR...

38:21.170 --> 38:23.800
-OR?
-OR I PROCEED WITH CHARGES
AGAINST YOUR FATHER

38:23.840 --> 38:26.300
TO THE FULL EXTENT
OF THE RESOURCES
AVAILABLE TO ME.

38:26.340 --> 38:29.300
HE MAY END UP IN THE CLEAR,
BUT IT WON'T BE AN
EASY RIDE FOR HIM.

38:30.930 --> 38:32.060
THINK ABOUT THAT.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.980
WE COULD USE YOU.

38:35.560 --> 38:37.440
YOUR CITY COULD USE YOU.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.440
TRY NOT BEING SELFISH

38:43.530 --> 38:44.900
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE.

38:46.860 --> 38:47.860
&lt;JAKE BREATHES DEEPLY&gt;

38:53.580 --> 38:57.790
SO I TOLD THE DOCTORS, I
SAID NO, NO. NO PAINKILLERS
NECESSARY. I CAN TAKE IT.

38:57.830 --> 38:59.920
THAT WAS RIGHT AFTER HE
PUKED ON HER SHOES.

38:59.960 --> 39:02.040
WHAT? WHOA, WHOA,
NO, NO, NO, THAT WAS
FROM THE CONCUSSION,

39:02.090 --> 39:03.380
NOT FROM THE LEG,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

39:03.420 --> 39:04.460
OH.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.590
-TO DES, THE HERO.
-&lt;TINNY GIGGLING&gt;

39:06.630 --> 39:08.760
YES, B'Y, DES THE HERO!

39:08.800 --> 39:10.550
-&lt;ALL LAUGHING&gt;
-CHEERS!

39:14.640 --> 39:15.390
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

39:16.930 --> 39:17.980
&lt;DOOR CLOSING&gt;

39:18.020 --> 39:19.440
[JAKE] HEY.

39:19.480 --> 39:20.600
THERE YOU ARE.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.020
HOW'RE YOU DOING?

39:26.530 --> 39:28.450
IT'S BEEN A GOOD RUN, JAKE.

39:31.450 --> 39:33.450
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.420
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS, SKIPPER?

39:41.460 --> 39:43.630
ORSON WELLES ONCE SAID,

39:43.670 --> 39:46.090
"IF YOU WANT A HAPPY ENDING,

39:46.130 --> 39:48.470
"YOU NEED TO KNOW
WHEN TO END YOUR STORY."

39:48.510 --> 39:51.510
YEAH, BUT DAD, IT'S NOT
EXACTLY LIKE YOU'RE DYING
OR ANYTHING.

39:51.550 --> 39:52.760
THAT'S KINDA THE POINT.

39:56.470 --> 39:57.480
&lt;TSKING&gt;

40:02.610 --> 40:04.570
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU'RE SURE?

40:04.610 --> 40:07.570
NOPE, BUT I THINK IT'S TIME.

40:10.530 --> 40:11.910
I'M LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

40:12.780 --> 40:14.580
IT'S BEEN A HELL OF A RIDE.

40:14.620 --> 40:15.620
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

40:17.490 --> 40:18.750
CHEERS TO THAT.

40:21.580 --> 40:22.580
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

40:25.460 --> 40:27.760
HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

40:27.800 --> 40:31.760
WELL, HE IS ALL YOURS.

40:36.850 --> 40:39.520
YOU SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL,
BECAUSE HE'S A REAL
CROOKED ARSE,

40:39.560 --> 40:40.560
ESPECIALLY AROUND NOON.

40:41.690 --> 40:44.060
UM, SO...

40:44.100 --> 40:47.230
YEAH. THINK IT'S TIME TO
CALL IT IN.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.400
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

40:49.440 --> 40:51.070
YOU WANNA TAKE A REAL LONG
VACATION WITH ME?

40:51.650 --> 40:52.700
&lt;CHUCKLING&gt;

40:52.740 --> 40:54.030
YES.

40:55.910 --> 40:56.910
OH.

40:59.830 --> 41:02.670
HEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

41:02.710 --> 41:04.630
OH, I'LL BE FINE. YOU KNOW,

41:04.670 --> 41:07.750
IT'S TIME I TOOK OFF MY
TRAINING WHEELS ANYWAY,
RIGHT? PLUS,

41:10.260 --> 41:11.300
THEY OFFERED ME A JOB.

41:14.590 --> 41:15.720
TO NEW BEGINNINGS.

41:19.270 --> 41:20.680
TO NEW ENDINGS.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.140
TO NOT GETTING SHOT.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.210
HI.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.630
NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.220
UH... &lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

42:40.220 --> 42:42.640
UH, WHY?

42:43.720 --> 42:45.810
ARE YOU... ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

42:48.690 --> 42:49.900
YOU USED MY ACCESS CARD.

42:51.690 --> 42:53.690
TO FIND OUT ABOUT
CROCKER'S TRANSFER.

42:53.730 --> 42:56.110
OKAY, UM, LESLIE, PLEASE.

42:56.150 --> 42:58.360
AND THEN YOU BROKE
CROCKER OUT OF CUSTODY.

42:58.410 --> 42:59.530
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

42:59.570 --> 43:00.910
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, JAKE.

43:03.790 --> 43:04.870
THEY FIRED ME.

43:08.420 --> 43:09.330
&lt;SOBBING&gt;
