00:36.704 --> 00:39.571
Black, 22.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.475
Black, 22!

00:45.312 --> 00:47.546
Set!

01:07.901 --> 01:09.234
You there.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.103
What's your name?

01:12.872 --> 01:14.840
You Freddie?

01:14.842 --> 01:17.843
Freddie, I'm guessing you
never played football.

01:21.582 --> 01:25.250
I want you to take a look at
your buddies down the bench.

01:25.252 --> 01:28.921
Go on. Now do you see any
difference between you and them?

01:34.561 --> 01:39.031
Nothing? Not a thing?

01:40.533 --> 01:42.935
    - What's your name, son?
    - Ashley.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.269
Ashley?

01:48.142 --> 01:49.708
Ashley.

01:49.710 --> 01:53.579
Ashley, can you tell
Freddie what's wrong?

01:53.581 --> 01:58.117
       Your shoulder pads.
       They go under your shirt.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.588
It's going
to be a long season.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.956
I loved that
      1982 team.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.058
Championship game
was incredible.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.626
I was on the sidelines.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.794
And why can't
we do that again?

02:09.797 --> 02:13.265
    - Do what?
    - Win a championship.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.834
You've won one,
why not two?

02:15.836 --> 02:17.603
    I've won two,
    but who's counting...

02:17.605 --> 02:19.805
Coach just take over
for a minute right?

02:19.807 --> 02:21.640
All right,
    you heard the coach.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.142
     Form two,
     two lines over there.

02:23.144 --> 02:26.945
Mr. Marshall agrees,
together, we can do it.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.148
            Weren't you going
            to get me a beverage
            or something?

02:29.150 --> 02:32.351
Oh, yeah,
I'll get your soda.
Did you say diet?

02:32.353 --> 02:37.523
  - No.
  - No, of course not.
  Stupid of me. Diet. Stupid.

02:37.525 --> 02:40.025
I'll be right back!

02:41.995 --> 02:43.262
                  What was that?

02:43.264 --> 02:46.465
A pain in my neck, mainly.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.834
           He teaches math over
           at the middle school.

02:48.836 --> 02:52.204
Yeah, well, he's
the new Athletic Director now.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.007
        - You kidding?
        - I wish I was.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.042
               Well, how in heck
               did that happen?

02:57.044 --> 02:59.778
Well, some bull about
the board wanting

02:59.780 --> 03:02.714
a football program
succession plan.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.149
                    Huh.

03:04.151 --> 03:07.152
It doesn't hurt
that his uncle's on the board.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.453
                    Oh.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.988
Quarterbacks,
  I don't need you to fire it.

03:09.990 --> 03:13.358
        Freddie, let's
        fix those pads.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.694
Hi, I'm Travis.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.396
        - I'm Jerry.
        - Can you throw?

03:17.398 --> 03:18.730
                  Can you catch?

03:18.732 --> 03:20.832
They aim
to replace me.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.569
      What? Are they firing you?

03:23.571 --> 03:25.070
No, Willard, I'm retiring.

03:25.072 --> 03:29.741
They just want to
name my successor.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.311
What they don't realize is,
I already know who

03:32.313 --> 03:35.814
the next football coach
at Corbin is going to be.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.549
   - And I'm looking at him.
   - Me?

03:37.551 --> 03:41.386
Willard, do you want
to coach Pee Wee league
the rest of your life?

03:41.388 --> 03:46.358
I want you to
  go at about fifty percent,
  just a little jog, okay.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.826
Hut.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.828
        Travis, that's too fast.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.665
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

03:53.667 --> 03:55.400
Wow!
      - That'll do.

03:55.402 --> 04:00.405
      - Who're those boys?
      - That's boy's name
      is Travis Freeman.

04:00.407 --> 04:05.077
    - He's, um, Jerry Baker.
    - Here, Coach.

04:05.079 --> 04:09.248
Now those two boys
were born to play football.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.251
Running backs
and straight ahead, you can run
a straight line can't you?

04:12.253 --> 04:14.886
Yes, sir!
   - What's this play called?

04:14.888 --> 04:17.589
23 Blast!
   - Why do we call it that?

04:17.591 --> 04:20.559
The 2 back runs
    through the 3 hole!

04:20.560 --> 04:23.629
    All right, bring it in.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.397
One, two, three...

04:25.399 --> 04:27.866
Red Hounds!
All right,
   let's go.

04:27.868 --> 04:31.436
- Travis.
- Yes, coach.

04:31.438 --> 04:35.474
  - Does Jerry know the plays?
  - Uhh, yeah, pretty much.

04:35.476 --> 04:39.444
Well, you know 'em real good.
So you'll help him out, right?

04:42.949 --> 04:45.217
23 Blast! 23 Blast!

04:45.219 --> 04:46.451
         And 23 Blast!

04:46.453 --> 04:48.020
Ready! Break!

04:51.124 --> 04:53.492
Fingertips!

04:53.494 --> 04:54.926
             Down!

04:54.928 --> 04:56.628
  Cameron, get your butt down!

04:56.630 --> 04:59.731
Set! Hut!

05:05.506 --> 05:08.440
- Whoo!
Travis,
        meet at the top.

05:14.315 --> 05:17.916
   I don't know why Coach Farris
   puts up with you,
   but I will not.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.319
I don't want to
lose this, Mr. Duncan.
You know what this is?

05:20.321 --> 05:23.188
If I find contraband, Mr. Baker,
I will have you expelled.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.324
No, sir, this is an article
about my friend, here.

05:25.326 --> 05:28.527
"Travis Freeman,
the Redhound star
everything man,

05:28.529 --> 05:30.429
has his team on the
fast track to the..."

05:30.431 --> 05:34.099
   - Empty your pockets.
   - "He catches touchdowns,
   he runs for touchdowns,

05:34.101 --> 05:36.301
he's the heart
and soul of the team.
Blah blah, blah."

05:36.303 --> 05:40.138
Nothing about the handsome
quarterback, Jerry Baker.
Why is that, Mr. Duncan?

05:40.140 --> 05:43.475
        Because you're
        not worth writing about.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.677
         - Mr. Freeman.
         - Yes sir?

05:45.679 --> 05:50.916
I suggest you find new friends,
you don't want to end up
in prison.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.688
            One day you're
            going to go too far!

05:56.690 --> 05:58.557
      He's been after
      me since 5th grade.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.025
He used to say I was
cheating in Math.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.793
  - You were cheating in Math.
  - I didn't cheat!

06:01.795 --> 06:04.396
   - You copied off my paper.
   - Yeah. Off of you.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.831
That's friends.
Don't count.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.715
          - Guess who!
          - Hi, Molly.

06:26.220 --> 06:30.155
       - Oh, man!
       - Aw, you're going
       to make me late!

06:30.157 --> 06:32.224
         Make sure you score
         a touchdown for me now.

06:32.226 --> 06:36.128
- Okay, I'll try.

06:43.669 --> 06:48.540
Hey, I don't think your music
is supposed to arrive
before your car.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.042
     You know, it gets me
     all pumped up for the game.

06:51.044 --> 06:56.415
You know what,
I forgot to ask,
how'd that Math exam go?

06:56.417 --> 06:57.582
                        Aced it.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.452
Ooh, you're my favorite son.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.953
         Mom, I'm your only son.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.923
That must be why
you're my favorite.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.391
       - Get out of here.
       - Oh!

07:06.393 --> 07:07.726
       You gotta be quicker
       if you want one of those.

07:07.728 --> 07:08.794
I'm going to
get in your sleep.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.762
                    Yeah, right.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.098
      - Kick butt, Trav!
      - Thanks, Ashley.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.766
Hey, don't forget
my touchdown!

07:14.768 --> 07:17.269
      Don't forget my touchdown!

07:17.271 --> 07:20.105
   Oh, hey, Ashley.
   Good, Karen, you're here.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.408
Can you take a look at that?
Something's wrong with that pen,
it keeps falling off my sweater.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.077
- You want to get started
   on the chili for me?
You got it.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.712
Thank you, dear.

07:27.714 --> 07:31.116
   - Hey, Mr. Freeman.
   - Ashley.
   You got my camera, missus?

07:31.118 --> 07:36.455
   Got it all charged up.
   Don't forget to press record.

07:53.841 --> 07:57.242
Hey. Hey, Burley,
  you listen to me,

07:57.244 --> 07:59.110
he hasn't missed
a single game,

07:59.112 --> 08:01.947
and he's not going
to miss one now because
he's got a runny nose.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.516
            If his fever's gone,
            he can play.

08:05.952 --> 08:09.421
        Feel him.
        Go on, feel him.

08:09.423 --> 08:13.358
   - Huh? Cool as a cucumber.
   - You feeling all right,
   Cameron?

08:13.360 --> 08:18.096
    He has got to play.
    My boy has got to play.

08:18.098 --> 08:23.201
I'm ready, coach,
I'm ready to play.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.936
- Are we ready?
- Ready.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.171
- Are we ready?
- Ready!

08:26.173 --> 08:27.205
- Are we ready?
- Ready!

08:27.207 --> 08:28.607
- Are we ready?
- Ready!

08:28.609 --> 08:30.642
- Redhound! Redhound!
- Pride! Pride!

08:30.644 --> 08:31.776
          - Redhound!
          - Pride!

08:31.778 --> 08:32.811
          - Redhound!
          - Pride!

08:32.813 --> 08:34.513
          - Redhound!
          - Pride!

08:34.515 --> 08:37.381
- Ah!

08:43.155 --> 08:45.056
<i>Tonight it's</i>
    <i> the Corbin Redhounds</i>

08:45.058 --> 08:47.492
<i> hosting the Lynn Camp Wildcats.</i>

08:47.494 --> 08:50.161
 <i> The Redhound defense doesn't</i>
 <i> give up many big plays</i>

08:50.163 --> 08:53.365
 <i> and that's the way head coach</i>
 <i> Willard Farris likes it.</i>

08:53.367 --> 08:56.468
  <i> The Wildcats will have to</i>
  <i> pick their spots tonight.</i>

08:56.470 --> 09:00.672
  <i> The 4 & 1 Redhounds boast</i>
  <i> a high powered offense</i>

09:00.674 --> 09:02.874
<i> led by Junior Travis Freeman.</i>

09:17.023 --> 09:20.892
       Corbin Redhounds!

09:20.894 --> 09:24.029
  Corbin Redhounds! Let's go!

09:24.031 --> 09:26.865
Lee rip zip, 34 power,
strong wing left. Go on.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.901
    - I'm gonna get closer.
    - Okay.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.236
              I'll be over there
              in a second.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.271
              Get in there, son!
              Come on, Cam!

09:33.273 --> 09:36.341
Hey, Marshal.
How's little Cam feeling?

09:36.343 --> 09:38.910
       Back to normal, eating me
       out of house and home.

09:38.912 --> 09:44.416
  Yeah. Well, you know,
  they're growing boys.
  How you all feeling tonight?

09:47.788 --> 09:49.921
      I want my touchdown!

09:52.859 --> 09:56.361
<i>Touchdown,</i>
     <i> Redhounds!</i>

09:56.363 --> 09:58.964
  - What happened, who scored?
  - Travis!

09:58.966 --> 10:01.099
         Travis,
         I missed his touchdown?

10:01.101 --> 10:05.403
<i>Touchdown Redhounds!</i>

10:05.405 --> 10:07.305
        <i> Travis Freeman.</i>

10:09.543 --> 10:11.376
      - How did he score?
      - He ran it in.

10:11.378 --> 10:15.614
 - Nah, I think it was a pass.
 - 23 Blast!

10:15.616 --> 10:16.948
                        23 what?

10:16.950 --> 10:19.117
     Okay, I test
     Fred on all the plays,

10:19.119 --> 10:21.286
     so that when they put
     him in he's ready.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.922
Whatever it was,
Larry's got it on tape.

10:23.924 --> 10:27.025
    I'm not so sure he does.

10:32.132 --> 10:36.401
Panther right,
40 lead, 46 power, go on.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.974
           How much time we got?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.310
      Uh, we're fine.
      Where's the party tonight?

10:45.312 --> 10:49.314
     - Quit messing around,
     call the play.
     - No fun.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.983
                           Okay.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.120
       Dang, I can't remember...

10:55.122 --> 10:57.422
                  Oh, well.
                  Trav, go deep.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.591
      - Come on Jerry.
      - What's the play!?

10:59.593 --> 11:02.494
       Hey! You guys want
       to win this game or not?!

11:02.496 --> 11:05.697
   Let's do combo right.
   Z left. You guys do whatever.

11:05.699 --> 11:09.467
     You get in the end zone.
     And you, give me some time.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.603
- On one. Ready?
- Break!

11:15.941 --> 11:18.209
That's not the play
you called, Willard.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.012
      Black 22, black 22.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.248
           Set. Hut.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.651
    - He's open. He's open.
    - Okay.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.856
Pull, pull!

11:40.633 --> 11:43.134
<i>That's</i>
   <i> Travis Freeman once again</i>

11:43.136 --> 11:45.670
   <i> on a pretty pass from</i>
   <i> quarterback Jerry Baker.</i>

11:45.672 --> 11:51.743
 <i> Bold call from Coach Willard</i>
 <i> Farris, but it worked.</i>

11:51.745 --> 11:56.981
Davey Crockett,
you ever change my plays again,
I will bench you fast.

11:56.983 --> 12:02.087
<i>He's got the</i>
 <i> Redhounds and his workhorse</i>
 <i> firing on all cylinders.</i>

12:02.089 --> 12:03.555
         Good job, man.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.690
     - He call you
     Davey Crockett again?
     - Yeah.

12:05.692 --> 12:08.226
      You think I should
      tell him it's not my name?

12:08.228 --> 12:10.862
      - It's a good name.
      - Hey, hey Marlow.

12:10.864 --> 12:14.265
  This game's not over.
  Now, get your head in the
  game, there's another half.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.501
   Come on! Come on! Come on!

12:16.503 --> 12:19.804
 - That was a heck of a throw.
 - Yes, sir.

12:21.407 --> 12:25.777
   - Did he forget the play?
   - Yes, sir.

12:29.683 --> 12:34.085
     - You all right?
     - Yes. This headache
     is just getting worse!

12:34.087 --> 12:38.857
    - Do you want to leave?
    - No, no, I'll be fine,
    it's just, uh...

12:38.859 --> 12:42.594
                 Ew! Get off me.

12:42.596 --> 12:46.097
     - Loser.
     - Do all the
     cheerleaders love me,

12:46.099 --> 12:48.666
      or is it just Molly?

12:52.037 --> 12:56.541
  - Your dad know you're here?
  - You kidding?
  I'm studying with you!

12:56.543 --> 13:00.945
You can't hang with me.
I'll beat you at keg stand too.

13:00.947 --> 13:04.382
       - He better not
       mess up this year.
       - He'll be fine.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.484
            He still doesn't
            even know the plays!

13:06.486 --> 13:08.720
    - Look, he gets mixed up
    once in a while...
    - I mean it.

13:08.722 --> 13:11.389
         He can't be screwing up
         my scholarship.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.259
          You're always covering
          for him.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.628
            I got one shot, one.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.130
            And he's ain't going
            to mess that up.

13:19.132 --> 13:23.501
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

13:26.673 --> 13:29.808
             You better control
             your boy or I will.

13:36.282 --> 13:39.450
    - Redhounds, baby!
    - Hey, Jerry, come on.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.519
You and me man,
    Redhounds.
    - Hey.

13:41.521 --> 13:45.990
   Me and you,
   we're going to state. Hey!

13:45.992 --> 13:49.360
              Okay, that's
              your friend Jerry.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.700
             Whoa!

13:57.002 --> 13:58.636
              Dad!

13:58.638 --> 14:02.407
Let's see
    what's going on here.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.612
             When did you notice
             the swelling?

14:07.614 --> 14:09.047
This morning.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.883
         Close your eyes for me.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.952
                       Now open.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.189
Is this
from football?

14:18.191 --> 14:22.393
      No, Travis has a
      great deal of infection
      visible in the sinus area.

14:22.395 --> 14:26.197
      Infection, where
      did that come from?

14:26.199 --> 14:27.665
              It's hard to tell.

14:27.667 --> 14:31.302
    I want to get Travis started
    on medication right away.

14:33.305 --> 14:35.907
        Dr. Connelly wants me
        to prep a surgical room.

14:35.909 --> 14:40.144
- What's happening?
- Travis's infection
is not responding to medication.

14:40.146 --> 14:43.681
His face is swelling
and his temperature
has risen to 106.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.885
     - Oh, dear Lord!
     - We need to get him
     into surgery quickly.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.487
I'll have more answers
when I get in there
and see what we're up against.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.857
   - Here he is. Here he is.
   - Oh, Travis! Hi, baby!

14:52.859 --> 14:56.194
You're gonna have
to take that cross off.
Yes, ma'am.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.329
Okay, I got it. I got it.
Hi, honey.

14:58.331 --> 15:02.901
Mama's right here. Okay?

15:02.903 --> 15:04.903
             - Hey.
             - Hmm.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.438
I'll see you soon.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.574
- I'm going to be fine, Mom.
- Now!

15:09.576 --> 15:12.777
        - Okay.
        - I'll be fine.

15:17.082 --> 15:20.818
         All right,
         he'll be fine.

15:32.264 --> 15:37.001
Travis,
   I need you to count
   backwards for me from 100.

15:40.105 --> 15:45.910
100, 99,

15:45.912 --> 15:51.983
           98, 97...

16:22.781 --> 16:24.849
            Go deep!

16:28.754 --> 16:30.888
           Go deeper!

16:33.125 --> 16:34.726
            Deeper!

17:52.905 --> 17:56.774
Hello! Hello!

17:58.010 --> 17:59.744
         - Oh, Travis.
         - Mom?

17:59.746 --> 18:02.680
   Travis. We're right here.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.882
Mom, no, I can't see.
What...

18:04.884 --> 18:08.686
    Honey, listen, the
    doctor explained to us

18:08.688 --> 18:11.255
         - that you...
         - Dad!

18:11.257 --> 18:14.058
       - I'm here.
       - Why can't I see?

18:14.060 --> 18:16.994
            Travis.

18:22.367 --> 18:25.203
Explain what, Dad?

18:25.205 --> 18:28.005
              You're blind, son.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.643
What do you
mean I'm blind?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.979
         You lost your eyesight.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.048
Okay.

18:37.050 --> 18:40.017
Okay, for how long?

18:41.553 --> 18:43.855
I don't understand.

18:44.723 --> 18:48.793
             There was
             too much infection.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.071
I can't be blind!

19:01.340 --> 19:02.773
No, Mom.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.976
It's okay, baby.
   It's gonna be okay.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.044
Dad.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.158
         We'll get through this.

19:44.449 --> 19:47.018
       You see that?

20:10.909 --> 20:12.977
                      You heard?

20:17.482 --> 20:19.417
              I'm gonna need you
              to stay focused.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.619
I'm focused.

20:22.588 --> 20:26.524
           Okay, you're focused.

20:26.526 --> 20:30.127
               I'm going to need
               to step up.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.399
            Team needs a leader.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.903
               Are you that guy?

20:42.441 --> 20:45.243
 Thank you for coming, really.

20:45.245 --> 20:49.580
 I'll make sure Travis knows
 that each of every one
 of you were here.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.316
        Take care, okay?

20:56.188 --> 20:58.723
            He's getting better.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.726
       He's just not up
       for visitors yet.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.362
           I'm sorry.

21:17.876 --> 21:19.910
          - Sorry.
          - Come here.

21:19.912 --> 21:24.782
<i>I know the last</i>
<i> thing you want to do right now</i>
<i> is play football.</i>

21:26.752 --> 21:31.122
 Like it or not, we got a game.

21:31.124 --> 21:37.295
  I don't know why things like
  this happen to good people.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.664
         I don't know.

21:39.666 --> 21:45.002
    I do know, Travis would
    not want any of you

21:45.004 --> 21:47.972
     to use his misfortune
     as an excuse

21:47.974 --> 21:49.807
   for not playing your best,

21:49.809 --> 21:52.810
      for not playing just
      the way you would,

21:52.812 --> 21:56.647
  if he was out there with us.

21:56.649 --> 22:00.184
        That's what he
        expects from us

22:00.186 --> 22:02.953
       and that's all we
       can do for him.

22:02.955 --> 22:07.758
   So we're going to dedicate
   this game to Travis.

22:09.094 --> 22:10.861
          Bring it in.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.201
       - Travis on three.
       - One, two, three.

22:17.203 --> 22:19.170
Travis!

22:19.172 --> 22:22.006
<i>Baker is trying</i>
  <i> to signal his receiver,</i>

22:22.008 --> 22:25.543
<i> there is some confusion on the</i>
<i> line with another delay...</i>

22:25.545 --> 22:28.779
- Come on, man!

22:30.315 --> 22:34.251
<i>He bumped</i>
     <i> into the guard.</i>

22:39.359 --> 22:40.991
         Throw it away!

22:40.993 --> 22:44.128
             Hello?

22:46.366 --> 22:50.434
- Bingo!

22:58.211 --> 22:59.877
              Ah!

22:59.879 --> 23:01.379
   - What are you doing?
   - What're you doing, man?

23:01.381 --> 23:03.748
  - It's an inside curl.
  - He's supposed to cut out.

23:03.750 --> 23:07.218
       - Shut your mouth.
       - It's inside.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.526
<i>I love them</i>
     <i> Redhounds.</i>

24:55.528 --> 24:59.029
 <i> Love 'em but, boy, my heart</i>
 <i> can't take another season</i>

24:59.031 --> 25:01.966
        <i> like last one.</i>
        <i> Disappointment.</i>

25:01.968 --> 25:05.135
     <i> Redhounds are</i>
     <i> a big disappointment.</i>

25:05.137 --> 25:07.671
   <i> They let us down again.</i>

25:07.673 --> 25:10.174
Open, right there. Oh!

25:10.176 --> 25:13.043
I'm sorry, sweetie,
that bite was too big.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.713
     - That's all right.
     - Okay, here we go.

25:15.715 --> 25:19.350
         - No...
         - Oh! Travis!

25:19.352 --> 25:21.652
            No, it's disgusting,
            those are not eggs.

25:21.654 --> 25:22.720
        - Oh, honey!
        - Orange juice.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.522
          Right here.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.390
 - Oh, the straw is right here.
 - Mom, I got it.

25:26.392 --> 25:28.526
        Mom, I know where
        the straw is, thank you.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.261
             Okay.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.230
             Jerry!

25:33.232 --> 25:35.299
        How did you get
        past the nurse?

25:35.301 --> 25:39.370
Oh, I can be
sneaky sometimes.

25:39.372 --> 25:42.172
Hey, Trav.

25:42.174 --> 25:45.509
Yeah, I know, I know you
don't want any visitors.

25:45.511 --> 25:50.214
I don't blame you.
Some of them people
are like sandpaper.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.918
Some of them people
are real snoozers.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.186
    And what makes you
    think you ain't one of them?

25:56.188 --> 25:57.855
Oh!

25:57.857 --> 26:00.291
Good, I thought you
might have been deaf, too!

26:01.860 --> 26:03.827
                 It's okay, Mom.
                 Jerry can stay.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.429
Oh, what, like he's
going to kick me out?

26:05.431 --> 26:06.530
        I was thinking about it.

26:06.532 --> 26:08.332
   Jerry, do you think maybe
   you could stay

26:08.334 --> 26:10.601
with Travis for a little while?
I have an errand to run.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.636
Sure.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.608
        I won't be long.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.990
         - Ha ha ha...
         - Really?

26:34.426 --> 26:40.431
     - Just checking.
     - Well, how'd you do?

26:40.433 --> 26:43.734
Ah, we did all right.
We didn't make playoffs.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.769
                I know all that,
                how did you do?

26:45.771 --> 26:49.039
Oh, you know me,
I'm did good.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.442
Well, they moved me
to second string, but...

26:51.444 --> 26:56.046
 What? They put Freddie
 in over you! How'd that happen?

26:56.048 --> 26:57.915
I don't know.
Farris never liked me.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.283
               Farris loves you.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.585
Come on,
let's get out of here.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.364
           Oh, hey,
           check out the nurses.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.433
         Whoa, babe on the left.

27:16.435 --> 27:19.136
      - Blonde, brunette?
      - Nope, redhead.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.338
              She's a cutie too.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.407
       Look left and smile sexy.

27:30.949 --> 27:32.750
        I still got it.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.486
               Oh, sweet shades.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.454
     - Here, put these on.
     - What?

27:37.456 --> 27:38.122
            - Here.
            - Ow!

28:28.407 --> 28:30.541
    - When I say jump, jump.
    - Wait, what?

28:30.543 --> 28:31.875
             Jump!

28:45.356 --> 28:46.590
       Let me ask you something.

28:46.592 --> 28:48.392
          Did we just make fools
          of ourselves?

28:48.394 --> 28:50.194
      - Yes, pretty much.
      - Yes!

28:50.196 --> 28:53.497
        Hey, meet me at the top.

28:55.066 --> 28:59.303
      - What's blind like?
      - It is weird.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.643
         It's pretty scary, man.

29:08.279 --> 29:10.414
                It's like having
                your eyes closed

29:10.416 --> 29:13.650
               and you can never
               open them.

29:15.687 --> 29:17.788
I'm sorry, man.

29:24.262 --> 29:27.097
You're going be fine,
man, all right?

29:27.099 --> 29:29.099
You're Travis Freeman.

29:43.648 --> 29:47.985
<i>Dr. Sanders</i>
    <i> report to ICU.</i>

29:47.987 --> 29:51.622
  <i> Dr. Sanders report to ICU.</i>

30:03.468 --> 30:06.069
You need to fill
out these forms.

30:06.071 --> 30:08.472
We'll set up
a referral meeting,

30:08.474 --> 30:11.975
and come up with an
intervention plan
for your son.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.611
           An intervention plan?

30:14.613 --> 30:18.148
The sooner we start the process,
the sooner we'll find
a place for Travis.

30:18.150 --> 30:23.754
             Travis has a place,
             in our home.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.326
Mrs. Freeman,
you need to realize,

30:29.328 --> 30:33.197
you no longer
have a normal son.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.339
                Let me help you.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.107
      It's your first time home,
      maybe you want to try

30:44.109 --> 30:45.843
    using the cane.
    It's right here, sweetheart.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.110
I don't want to use it.

31:09.033 --> 31:12.269
Come in.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.173
   - Hey.
   - Hey, coach, how are you?

31:16.175 --> 31:19.710
Come on in, please.
Close the door.

31:19.712 --> 31:21.645
Have a seat.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.584
Willard, I want you
to know you have my support.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.820
      - Thank you, Jasper.
      - Let me finish.

31:29.822 --> 31:33.490
You have my support,
if you want to drop
Baker from the team.

31:33.492 --> 31:37.160
        Jerry? Drop him?
        What gave you that idea?

31:37.162 --> 31:41.431
Baker is just the
worst kind of bad egg,

31:41.433 --> 31:44.067
always trying
to get away with something.

31:44.069 --> 31:48.906
      - He's trouble.
      - Look, I will agree
      with you,

31:48.908 --> 31:51.241
           Jerry is a challenge,

31:51.243 --> 31:53.377
         but football is the
         only thing the boy has.

31:53.379 --> 31:56.179
     - You benched him.
     - Yeah, I know I did.

31:56.181 --> 31:59.049
   He lost his way, but who
   knows he won't figure it out.

31:59.051 --> 32:02.920
Willard, your contract
is up after next year,
isn't it?

32:02.922 --> 32:06.423
If Baker becomes a distraction,

32:06.425 --> 32:10.093
you have a remedy.
Don't you?

32:15.634 --> 32:18.435
Kentucky Mobility
Center, may I help you?

32:18.437 --> 32:20.270
    Yes. One moment, please.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.806
Travis Freeman.

32:24.909 --> 32:27.778
     Oh, good, you're back.
     How did it go?

32:27.780 --> 32:30.948
                  Waste of time.

32:30.950 --> 32:33.283
             I'm not going back.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.153
Well, that's fine.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.722
An hour there
and an hour back,

32:38.724 --> 32:40.991
and he walks out on the
woman after 15 minutes.

32:40.993 --> 32:44.461
 - And you say it's just fine.
 - He didn't like her, Larry.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.831
15 minutes, and the women
is supposed to be

32:47.833 --> 32:51.802
his mobility coach,
assigned to him by the state!

32:51.804 --> 32:54.471
Who else is going to teach
him how to get along?

32:54.473 --> 32:57.474
- We'll figure it out.
- It's been almost three months

32:57.476 --> 32:59.710
and he's barely
left his room.

33:01.646 --> 33:06.483
Mary, we have to talk about
a special school for the boy.

33:08.286 --> 33:10.253
        He's not ready for that.

33:10.255 --> 33:13.190
    - I'll teach him myself.
    - No, you can't.

33:13.192 --> 33:15.492
     We have no experience
     with this.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.927
No, and that's final.

33:16.929 --> 33:19.663
Just hear me
      out for a second.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.608
Yes, can I help you?

33:31.610 --> 33:33.844
             Mrs. Freeman,
             I'm Patty Wheatley.

33:33.846 --> 33:38.015
   - Sorry?
   - Travis's mobility coach.

33:38.017 --> 33:42.185
Oh, I'm so sorry.
We just never expected
to see you here.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.455
        Travis has
        missed two appointments.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.357
                    Where is he?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.059
Well, he's in his bedroom,

33:49.061 --> 33:51.028
but I'm afraid you've come all
this way for nothing.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.864
      Where's his room?
      Travis? Is it in this way?

33:53.866 --> 33:57.300
You know what? I'm
afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

33:57.302 --> 34:02.506
   In accordance with the
   Individuals with Disabilities
   Education Act of 1990,

34:02.508 --> 34:07.677
the state Kentucky will allow
no disabled child to be deprived
of a free public education.

34:07.679 --> 34:10.414
I have not deprived
my son of anything.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.482
Mom.
      - Travis, its okay.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.886
 - Hey, Travis, remember me?
 - Oh, not you again.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.422
  - I'll be in my room.
  - Well, we can start there.

34:18.424 --> 34:21.757
     - Miss Wheatley, hey.
     - Whoa!

34:21.760 --> 34:26.830
 - His, uh, cane looks unused.
 - Mom.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.399
  Does your husband stack his
  dirty dishes in the bedroom?

34:29.400 --> 34:32.002
- Well, of course not,
but Travis...
- Why should you allow your son

34:32.004 --> 34:35.938
      - to treat your home
      like a pig sty?
      - Because... oh!

34:37.608 --> 34:39.376
Wow.

34:39.378 --> 34:41.411
Do you do your own cleaning?

34:41.413 --> 34:43.713
        Because I don't really
        care what it looks like.

34:43.715 --> 34:46.882
Well, let's open a window.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.585
Wow!

34:48.587 --> 34:51.154
Oh, that's better.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.759
Football player, huh?

34:55.761 --> 34:57.727
            You figure that
            out all by yourself?

34:57.729 --> 35:00.230
         - What's that?
         - Nothing.

35:00.232 --> 35:04.601
Yeah. Well, listen up, pal.
You got two options here:

35:04.603 --> 35:08.939
you can stay in your little,
safe, protected environment

35:08.941 --> 35:11.475
or you can get up off
your sorry, little can

35:11.477 --> 35:12.909
and figure out
how to whip this.

35:12.911 --> 35:15.278
It doesn't make any
difference to me.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.647
Just don't waste my time.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.537
          Son of a...

35:45.110 --> 35:50.847
<i>Hey, well,</i>
  <i> you know what that means,</i>
  <i> it's your Redhound report.</i>

35:50.849 --> 35:55.018
<i> Get your teeth off my legs.</i>

35:55.020 --> 35:58.355
   <i> For the next 60 minutes,</i>
   <i> I'll answer your calls</i>

35:58.357 --> 36:02.325
   <i> and tell you with just</i>
   <i> three months till kickoff</i>

36:02.327 --> 36:05.662
 <i> whether this year's Redhound</i>
 <i> Team has what it takes</i>

36:05.664 --> 36:07.864
     <i> to make the playoffs.</i>

36:17.375 --> 36:22.612
 - Here you are.
 - Oh, Ashley, thank you so...
 you are a life-saver.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.514
        It's all right.
        I also have your change.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.950
   - Oh, thank you, sweetie.
   - You're welcome.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.386
      Oh, you need me to take
      that sandwich into Travis?

36:29.388 --> 36:31.021
No, no, I can
take care of it.

36:31.023 --> 36:34.958
His dad is taking him to
Lexington in a little bit and...

36:36.327 --> 36:39.896
No, I would love for you
to take this into Travis.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.299
I bet he'd like
talking to you.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.101
                      All right.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.317
Travis?

37:04.488 --> 37:06.389
Trav?

37:14.098 --> 37:15.999
Trav.

37:23.541 --> 37:25.875
Trav.

37:25.877 --> 37:28.411
Hey, Trav! Oh, sorry.

37:28.413 --> 37:31.014
                         Ashley?

37:32.350 --> 37:35.552
Hey.

37:35.554 --> 37:41.124
      - Why are you here?
      - No reason.

37:41.126 --> 37:43.093
Nice hat.

37:48.599 --> 37:52.836
      - How are you doing?
      - Just great.

37:54.138 --> 37:55.639
Brought you some lunch.

37:55.641 --> 37:59.042
            I'm good, thank you.
            I'm not hungry.

37:59.744 --> 38:01.978
All right, well...

38:03.314 --> 38:04.781
                      Thank you.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.950
Oh, Travis,
you smell so bad.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.286
When is the last time
you showered?

38:09.288 --> 38:12.322
Just get up,
change your shirt.
Come on get up, get up.

38:12.324 --> 38:14.157
Get up.

38:17.628 --> 38:21.031
I think that's clean.
Here.

38:28.239 --> 38:31.408
         I need you
         to give me the shirt...

38:31.410 --> 38:34.377
Oh, um, yeah, I'm...

38:35.479 --> 38:39.849
Um, just give me one second.

38:46.657 --> 38:49.326
      - Thank you.
      - You're welcome.

38:49.328 --> 38:55.332
    - How is Molly doing?
    - Oh, uh, she's good.

38:55.334 --> 38:59.135
She, um, says hi and she misses
you and sends her love.

38:59.137 --> 39:02.339
     - Really?
     - No. Of course not,
     she's a brat, Travis.

39:02.341 --> 39:07.310
  - Uh-oh, someone's jealous.
  - I'm jealous?

39:07.312 --> 39:09.646
       Yeah, because you
       want to be a cheerleader.

39:09.648 --> 39:14.384
         - Yeah, yeah.
         - Hmm?

39:16.320 --> 39:18.555
         - What's that?
         - What?

39:18.557 --> 39:21.691
I feel a breeze,

39:21.693 --> 39:24.160
it's in my knees,

39:24.162 --> 39:26.029
it's in my hips,
it's on my lips.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.031
Bang, bang, ding, ding,
come on Redhounds,
do your thing.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.533
          You better
          knock it off, or else.

39:30.535 --> 39:34.237
I could smack you.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.676
Ready?

39:39.678 --> 39:43.246
     Dad? Ashley's here, sorry.

39:43.248 --> 39:45.915
Ashley.

39:58.195 --> 40:00.563
           Guess who?

40:00.565 --> 40:04.100
 Opposite foot, opposite foot,
 it's like kicking the can.

40:04.102 --> 40:07.771
  There you go, there you go.
  Now, hold your
  arm out straight.

40:07.773 --> 40:10.840
    No, your cane arm out
    straight, out straight.

40:10.842 --> 40:13.243
     Hold your arm out straight,
     there you go.

40:13.245 --> 40:16.079
              Keep your head up,
              keep your head up.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.782
     - What's the point?
     - Keep your head up.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.257
         Opposite foot,
         there you go.

40:27.259 --> 40:30.260
     - Shirts on the right.
     - Okay.

40:30.262 --> 40:31.728
Pants are on the left.

40:31.730 --> 40:35.932
Khakis and jeans,
feel the texture.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.302
 - Keep your arm out straight.
 - Why?

40:41.372 --> 40:43.640
                       You okay?

40:43.642 --> 40:46.409
Yes, ma'am,
arm out straight.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.145
               Arm out straight.

40:49.147 --> 40:52.849
Let's go and find
the washer and dryer.

40:59.457 --> 41:03.626
        - Ow!
        - Son of a gun.

41:14.004 --> 41:16.506
     - Keep your hand out.
     - Sorry.

41:16.508 --> 41:19.943
     $16.50 is your change.

41:19.945 --> 41:22.412
Would you mind counting
the bills out for me.

41:22.414 --> 41:24.080
             Sure.

41:24.082 --> 41:27.517
   That's ten, five and one.

41:27.519 --> 41:28.651
Thank you.

41:28.653 --> 41:31.354
So that's
       your school, huh?

41:31.356 --> 41:32.422
Yeah.

41:32.424 --> 41:34.824
Gonna miss it.

41:34.826 --> 41:38.495
               What about
               your senior year?

41:38.497 --> 41:40.630
I guess I'll be going
to school for the blind.

41:40.632 --> 41:43.500
   - Is that what you want?
   - Do I have a choice?

42:15.866 --> 42:19.836
              212 on your right,
              213 on your left.

42:53.437 --> 42:56.172
          You can get your books
          on audio tape.

42:56.174 --> 42:58.841
      Your teachers can give you
      your the tests orally.

42:58.843 --> 43:02.445
    Hey, it's impolite to stand
    with your back to the person
    who you're talking to.

43:02.447 --> 43:05.214
    - Sorry.
    - Yeah. There won't
    be anybody to guide you.

43:05.216 --> 43:08.585
  - You'll be on your own.
  - Good, because I don't
  want any special treatment.

43:08.587 --> 43:11.621
  No one's allowed in
  school on a weekend
  without special permission.

43:11.623 --> 43:14.724
  Goodness, could've
  sworn it was a Monday, my bad.

43:40.250 --> 43:43.286
        Well, this is your stop.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.457
You're not
gonna walk me in?

43:48.726 --> 43:51.628
       I have orders from Patty.

44:57.662 --> 44:58.895
Good morning, Travis.

44:58.897 --> 45:01.864
                   Welcome back.

45:01.866 --> 45:03.766
Thank you.

45:06.470 --> 45:08.905
       - My man.
       - Hey, what's up?

45:08.907 --> 45:11.207
      - How you're doing?
      - I'm good.

45:20.184 --> 45:23.286
   Why don't you take a picture,
   it'll last longer.

45:26.056 --> 45:28.224
    Your first class is in what?

45:28.226 --> 45:29.892
             - 213?
             - 213.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.794
Should be right
here on the left.

45:33.897 --> 45:36.332
     - What class is this?
     - Calculus.

45:36.334 --> 45:38.835
    - Where you are headed?
    - I got sheet metal 101.

45:38.837 --> 45:43.372
     - What class is that?
     - AP, pre-prison,
     taught by Duncan.

45:43.374 --> 45:45.908
See what happens
when you're not around?
Later.

45:45.910 --> 45:47.610
             Later.

45:54.218 --> 45:57.286
         Drixen runs up the gut,
         no, it's a fake.

45:57.288 --> 45:59.722
                 He's wide open.

45:59.724 --> 46:02.024
       Jerry overthrew him, bad.

46:02.026 --> 46:03.392
What was that?

46:03.394 --> 46:05.595
Cover somebody, you got
to cover somebody, son.

46:05.597 --> 46:08.097
       - Its cover three.
       - Yes, sir.

46:08.099 --> 46:11.901
Baker, my niece can throw a ball
better than that and she's
only four years old.

46:11.903 --> 46:14.270
    You content to be the
    backup now, is that it, huh?

46:14.272 --> 46:16.272
              Is Coach Farris
              always this happy?

46:16.274 --> 46:17.940
If he didn't yell,
he didn't like you.

46:17.942 --> 46:20.977
All of you,
what the heck is wrong with you
people?

46:20.979 --> 46:24.514
 Our first game is in ten days.

46:26.583 --> 46:27.884
           That's it!

46:27.886 --> 46:29.218
   I've had it with you all.

46:29.220 --> 46:31.454
     Suicide drill, coach,
     run it now!

46:31.456 --> 46:34.957
   Let's go!
   Line up on the goal line.

46:36.728 --> 46:39.428
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, on the hop.

46:39.430 --> 46:42.465
Sounds like he really
likes the whole team.

46:42.467 --> 46:47.837
- Travis, how're you doing?
Ashley?
- Hey, Coach. How they looking?

46:47.839 --> 46:51.507
I don't know
that we're gonna win
a single game this year.

46:51.509 --> 46:53.142
                Coach, you say
                that every year.

46:53.144 --> 46:55.444
Well, this year I mean it.

46:55.446 --> 46:58.014
         You should let me play.

46:58.016 --> 46:59.582
             Stop, I can keep up
             with these guys.

46:59.584 --> 47:01.784
Well, can you
play corner,
'cause Mullins,

47:01.786 --> 47:04.987
he couldn't cover
a one-legged receiver.

47:04.989 --> 47:08.591
 But he can hit, coach,
 he can tackle, he's a mad man.

47:08.593 --> 47:10.793
Oh yeah, it's true.
That boy, he can hit.

47:10.795 --> 47:16.833
  Maybe he could play safety.
  Maybe Kenny'd play corner.

47:16.835 --> 47:18.568
        He's pretty good
        at cover too.

47:20.637 --> 47:21.771
Huh.

47:27.444 --> 47:30.046
Huh.

47:32.217 --> 47:36.152
     Bring it in,
     first team defense.

47:36.154 --> 47:40.189
 We're going to try something.
 Thanks, son.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.390
                 You're welcome.

47:41.392 --> 47:44.126
Mullins, you're
gonna move over to safety.

47:44.128 --> 47:46.796
Yes, safety!

47:49.299 --> 47:51.968
        Smile any harder,
        your face will fall off.

47:57.574 --> 48:00.309
      All she did was say,
      are there any cars coming,

48:00.311 --> 48:04.647
            and I said I don't
            see anything my way.

48:04.649 --> 48:07.049
And I started to go!
I did, I started to go!

48:07.051 --> 48:10.486
Oh, you won't be laughing
when the insurance goes up.

48:10.488 --> 48:13.456
              It's not my fault.

48:14.491 --> 48:19.061
You miss it? Driving?

48:19.063 --> 48:22.398
Keep it straight, no, no,
little left, little left.

48:24.669 --> 48:27.770
Sorry, student driver.
 We'll work on that.

48:27.772 --> 48:31.374
Right, little right.
Okay, go slow, hold it,
hold, it's Duncan.

48:31.376 --> 48:34.977
      - Where?
      - Twenty feet
      up here on the left.

48:38.081 --> 48:42.752
   Oh, hey there, Mr. Duncan.
   I almost didn't see you.

48:55.532 --> 48:58.634
   - Right, right, right.
   - Quick, take this wheel.

48:58.636 --> 49:02.405
Oh, that was great.
Are you serious?

49:02.407 --> 49:04.707
Did you see his...
no, you didn't see his face.

49:04.709 --> 49:09.078
Willard, I am a great
believer in beginnings.

49:09.080 --> 49:12.381
Winners start strong.

49:13.951 --> 49:17.253
Seems to me like you need to
switch things up a little bit.

49:17.255 --> 49:19.922
Try a new variety of plays.

49:19.924 --> 49:22.291
        Well, thank you, Jasper,

49:22.293 --> 49:24.126
        I'll certainly take that
        under consideration.

49:24.128 --> 49:28.497
Now, I've got
some plays that I've been
drawing up in my office.

49:28.499 --> 49:31.300
            I'd like you to take
            a look at them.

49:54.791 --> 49:58.661
<i>Corbin lost</i>
  <i> this game in the trenches.</i>

49:58.663 --> 50:01.263
<i> Their defense has played well,</i>
<i> especially their secondary,</i>

50:01.265 --> 50:04.300
<i> but they've got to find a spot</i>
<i> for their running game.</i>

50:04.302 --> 50:07.670
       <i> Their line has</i>
       <i> got to dominate.</i>

50:07.672 --> 50:11.974
 <i> Tonight they didn't.</i>
 <i> Riley was sacked four times.</i>

50:11.976 --> 50:14.877
    <i> Hate to lose the first</i>
    <i> game of the season.</i>

50:14.879 --> 50:18.514
  <i> Boy howdy,</i>
  <i> hate to lose the first one.</i>

50:26.523 --> 50:30.226
   - Can I get you anything?
   - Nah, no, nothing.

50:30.228 --> 50:33.596
         Nothing, thanks, coach.

50:34.898 --> 50:38.534
Just one game,
we'll get 'em next week.

50:38.536 --> 50:41.771
        Offensive line
        isn't together.

50:45.208 --> 50:47.209
Defense played well.

50:47.211 --> 50:49.678
     Yeah, yeah, they did.

50:49.680 --> 50:53.582
                Switching Harris
                and Mullins,

50:53.584 --> 50:56.052
            that was a great i..

51:08.398 --> 51:11.634
You got a funny
look in your eye.

51:13.770 --> 51:14.703
Willard.

51:14.705 --> 51:16.539
<i>Not a good coach.</i>

51:16.541 --> 51:19.208
<i> Farris is not good for Corbin.</i>

51:19.210 --> 51:20.543
Come in.

51:20.545 --> 51:23.446
<i>Coach</i>
    <i> Willard Farris must go.</i>

51:23.448 --> 51:25.581
  Travis? How you doing, son?

51:25.583 --> 51:27.583
          Hey, Coach!

51:30.188 --> 51:33.456
Making out all right?
Classes, school all right?

51:33.458 --> 51:36.759
 - Yeah, no, they're all right.
 - Good.

51:36.761 --> 51:40.196
       - I'm a sit down.
       - Please.

51:40.198 --> 51:41.997
Yeah.

51:47.471 --> 51:50.106
          How is the team doing?

51:50.108 --> 51:51.874
Umm, the guys are okay.

51:51.876 --> 51:54.477
They're glad two-a-days are
done, I'll tell you that much.

51:54.479 --> 51:56.879
          Two-a-days.
          Oh, that sounds great.

51:58.648 --> 52:02.718
Look, Travis,
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

52:08.225 --> 52:12.428
Travis, I'm thinking you
should come back on the team.

52:12.430 --> 52:15.464
                           Oh...

52:15.466 --> 52:17.833
        You mean like you
        want me to help out with
        equipment or something?

52:17.835 --> 52:21.470
- That'd be fine.
- No, no, no, that's not exactly
what I was thinking.

52:21.472 --> 52:24.573
              What exactly
              were you thinking?

52:24.575 --> 52:27.243
I think you should play.

52:27.245 --> 52:31.547
      - Play? Play what?
      - Football.

52:35.318 --> 52:36.785
    I don't, I don't understand.

52:36.787 --> 52:42.791
Look, I've seen you
the past two weeks
watching practice.

52:42.793 --> 52:46.328
Travis, I never coached
a boy loves football
as much as you do.

52:46.330 --> 52:49.765
         Its impossible, coach,
         I can't catch the ball.
         I can't see it.

52:49.767 --> 52:51.367
Well, that's right,
of course you can't.

52:51.369 --> 52:54.170
   - So you are going to have
   to play center.
   - Center?

52:54.172 --> 52:57.373
That's right,
center, think about it.
Think about it.

52:57.375 --> 53:00.843
Listen, all you got to do is,
you're not going to have to

53:00.845 --> 53:02.211
pull block
or anything like that.

53:02.213 --> 53:04.680
You got to snap the ball
and you got to take out

53:04.682 --> 53:06.849
the nose tackle,
who's just foot in front of you.

53:06.851 --> 53:10.119
He'll probably find you.
Travis, all you've got to do...

53:10.121 --> 53:12.188
All right, stand up, come on.
Stand up.

53:12.190 --> 53:13.856
         - Okay.
         - Here you go.

53:13.858 --> 53:15.791
Square up now,
put your hands up.

53:15.793 --> 53:17.693
Put your hands up,
put them on me.

53:17.695 --> 53:19.662
Okay, and your feet, you want
to spread your feet apart

53:19.664 --> 53:21.063
a little bit so you
got some balance.

53:21.065 --> 53:22.998
When you move, you're
going to move laterally, right?

53:23.000 --> 53:26.068
You're not a gazelle
anymore, you're a pitbull.

53:26.070 --> 53:29.471
   - Okay.
   - You just move with me,
   you keep your hands on me.

53:29.473 --> 53:32.374
If I go right, yeah.
You've got to protect
your quarterback.

53:32.376 --> 53:35.311
Yeah, move them feet,
move them feet,
put your hands on me.

53:35.313 --> 53:38.314
Keep them on me, understand?
That's it, just keep coming,
keep coming,

53:38.316 --> 53:41.817
and all the time
I'm coming this way,
that's how I want to...

53:41.819 --> 53:44.720
       - How about that?
       - Ooh.

53:44.722 --> 53:46.655
You don't need your sight
for that, now do you?

53:46.657 --> 53:49.858
           - No, sir.
           - Well?

53:53.230 --> 53:54.630
                 You're serious?

53:58.902 --> 54:01.237
      - All right, listen.
      - I don't know.

54:01.239 --> 54:02.905
You think about it.

54:02.907 --> 54:05.341
You take the weekend, you talk
about it with your folks,

54:05.343 --> 54:08.877
and if you do decide that
you want to give it try,

54:08.879 --> 54:12.381
I'll expect you on my football
field, Monday afternoon.

54:12.383 --> 54:16.118
          - All right?
          - Yeah.

54:18.888 --> 54:20.756
             Coach?

54:26.563 --> 54:28.697
        What if I can't?

54:30.367 --> 54:32.768
      I'll see you Monday.

55:31.161 --> 55:35.097
The Lord is
   my light and my salvation.

55:35.099 --> 55:36.999
Whom shall I fear.

55:37.001 --> 55:39.601
   I want to welcome
   you all out this morning.

55:39.603 --> 55:41.437
 So glad you all could be here.

55:41.439 --> 55:44.606
 As I begin this morning,
 I want to ask everyone in here

55:44.608 --> 55:47.976
       to close your eyes
       for a moment,

55:47.978 --> 55:51.680
 everyone except for my friend
 here in the front row.

55:51.682 --> 55:55.050
  You can keep your eyes open.

55:58.521 --> 56:04.193
  Now, how would you respond
  if someone came in here

56:04.195 --> 56:07.196
     and told you that what
     you see right now

56:07.198 --> 56:11.333
  is what you're going to see
  for the rest of your life.

56:15.406 --> 56:18.040
 How would you respond
 if someone told you that you'd

56:18.042 --> 56:21.877
      never see the light
      of day again?

56:21.879 --> 56:24.847
      Would you be angry?

56:24.849 --> 56:27.483
      Would you be bitter?

56:27.485 --> 56:28.851
          Who is that?

56:28.853 --> 56:34.256
Would you blame
   God and ask, why me?

56:35.191 --> 56:38.827
      Or maybe beneath all
      of those questions,

56:38.829 --> 56:43.532
      all of that emotion
      is simply fear.

56:43.534 --> 56:49.471
       Fear of what your
       life might be?

56:50.774 --> 56:53.542
         Who are you,
         ask yourself.

56:53.544 --> 56:55.177
          Who are you?

57:03.420 --> 57:06.188
      I'm Travis Freeman.

57:07.924 --> 57:10.926
      Mom! Dad!
      I'm Travis Freeman!

57:10.928 --> 57:15.297
         - You're what?
         - Oh, honey.

57:15.299 --> 57:17.466
    I'm gonna play football!

57:26.644 --> 57:31.180
    - Bring it in!
    - Let's go. Oh the hop.

57:32.816 --> 57:34.783
            A player's
            gonna join the team.

57:34.785 --> 57:36.318
Where's he from?

57:36.320 --> 57:40.189
    - Right here in Corbin.
    - Who is he?

57:42.959 --> 57:45.961
No way! Really?

57:45.963 --> 57:48.497
               Yup. It's Travis.

57:48.499 --> 57:52.634
  - How's that even possible?
  - What position?

57:52.636 --> 57:54.837
         - Center.
         - No, no, no.

57:54.839 --> 57:56.638
         Cameron,
         you're moving to guard.

57:56.640 --> 58:00.142
         Kyle, you're our new
         short yardage fullback,
         congratulations.

58:00.144 --> 58:03.645
        Cameron, you'll still be
        making the line calls,

58:03.647 --> 58:07.382
 and you are going signal Travis
 where his man lines up.

58:08.818 --> 58:12.421
   I think he deserves a chance.

58:17.460 --> 58:20.662
           - Big day.
           - Yes.

58:20.664 --> 58:23.932
      - Is Mary here?
      - She's over there.

58:23.934 --> 58:27.369
Well, at least she came.

58:27.371 --> 58:30.105
                      Excuse me.

58:31.941 --> 58:35.577
     It's not a good idea.

58:37.881 --> 58:43.418
            - Hello.
            - Hello.

58:44.153 --> 58:46.021
                So you agreed
                to let him play?

58:46.023 --> 58:49.024
Agreed? It doesn't
matter what I say.

58:49.026 --> 58:50.526
I'm just the mother.

58:50.528 --> 58:54.563
They can bash
themselves senseless.
It's not up to me.

58:57.868 --> 59:01.803
- How's this even going to work?
- Don't worry about it.
He ain't gonna play.

59:01.805 --> 59:04.473
   - My dad took care of it.
   - What? How?

59:04.475 --> 59:07.342
   I told him
   about it last night,
   and he called Mr. Duncan.

59:07.344 --> 59:10.646
All right.
      Let's go! Let's go!

59:10.648 --> 59:15.651
     I want to see Special teams
     out on the field.
     On the hop, let's go!

59:17.754 --> 59:20.088
      Travis, there's a problem.

59:20.090 --> 59:22.391
      Blind? In the middle
      of all that mayhem.

59:22.393 --> 59:25.594
 If something happened to him,
 I wouldn't be able
 to live with myself.

59:25.596 --> 59:30.532
      Not to mention the
      school's liability.
      So, no.

59:30.534 --> 59:34.069
  - Well, it's not your call!
  - You can't stop him
  from playing football!

59:34.071 --> 59:40.042
   I can and I will.
   I'm the Athletic Director,
   and my word is gospel.

59:40.044 --> 59:43.078
      - Gospel, huh?
      You sure about that?
      - Yes, I am.

59:43.080 --> 59:45.514
Travis Freeman will
not play football.

59:45.516 --> 59:49.985
    Okay, you all heard him.
    Oh, by the way,
    who's your lawyer?

59:50.920 --> 59:54.456
      My... my...
      my what, my lawyer?

59:54.458 --> 59:58.126
 In accordance with the
 Individuals with Disabilities
 Education Act of 1990,

59:58.128 --> 01:00:02.598
the state of Kentucky is bound
to offer an equal opportunity
to participate in any school

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.700
  sanctioned functions to any
  child with a disability.

01:00:04.702 --> 01:00:06.868
 - Well, hang on a second.
 - I will alert your principal

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.804
   that your actions have
   put your school in direct
   conflict

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:10.939
  with the federal government,
  and advise him to expect

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:13.575
  the National Guard to shut
  and padlock the school doors
  in the morning.

01:00:13.577 --> 01:00:17.279
   Now, hold on now.
   I'm not breaking any laws.

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:19.781
We have regulations...
I, look, it's, uh...

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:23.452
        If I were you,
        I'd clear my schedule
        for the next few months.

01:00:23.454 --> 01:00:26.288
   You and your boss might be
   spending time in jail.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:30.258
Jail! You'll lock me...
No, hang on.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.960
Every player needs this form.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:36.598
I looked it up, this form signed
by his parents
allowing him to play.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.402
    - I signed that already!
    - Both. Both parents
    need to sign it.

01:00:40.404 --> 01:00:44.806
Now, I believe that Mrs. Freeman
has the same doubts that I have.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:46.608
Isn't that true,
Mrs. Freeman?

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:49.811
   - Oh, that was a bad move.
   - Excuse me?

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:53.248
            Larry...

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:58.453
       ...you got a pen?

01:00:58.455 --> 01:01:01.657
Well, you folks
will excuse us.

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:04.626
   - Travis, coach, let's go.
   - Thank you, Larry.

01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:07.663
         Come on, son.

01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:12.167
      Let's go. East west.
      Come on, come on,
      come on, come on.

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:19.341
                 National Guard?
                 Padlocks?

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:22.878
Maybe I exaggerated a bit.

01:01:28.452 --> 01:01:30.252
             Trav!

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:35.223
           Set! Hut!

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:38.293
You see? You see that?

01:01:38.295 --> 01:01:41.897
It's a distraction, that was
the last thing these boys need.

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:44.399
You gonna let it happen?

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:48.036
  I can't do nothing about it.
  She said it's against the law.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:53.341
        She said it's some civil
        liberties or civil
        something, it's bad.

01:01:53.343 --> 01:01:56.244
        All right, try it again.

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:58.046
     - Where?
     - Come back a little.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:00.148
            - Here?
            - Yeah.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:03.085
           Let's go.

01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:04.820
             Down!

01:02:04.822 --> 01:02:07.022
              Set!

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:09.491
              Hut!

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:11.727
     - Come on Freeman.
     - What?

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:14.763
         Hut! Hut! Hut!

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:39.054
 Get back in line,
 you'll get it. You'll get it.

01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:42.691
             I mean, he can't
             really play, right?

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.969
 Good job, good job, good job.

01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:56.938
        - There you go.
        - Put me in.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.541
       - Really?
       - Yeah, put me in.

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.879
- Right here?
- Shoulder width.
Yeah, yeah, I got you lined up.

01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:06.882
  You're good. He is right
  in front of you, all right?

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:08.483
           Stay low.

01:03:08.485 --> 01:03:12.521
        You want to play center?
        Well, get through me.

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:20.395
 - Put that in the paper.
 - I oughta take your head off.

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:23.131
 - Come on!
 - It can't happen in the game.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:26.134
    - You coward!
    - You shut it too. That
    just cost you 20 laps.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:29.805
  You too, Baker. Coach,
  you see they run every inch,
  or they'll do it again.

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:34.075
     - Yes, sir, coach.
     - All right let's go.

01:03:34.077 --> 01:03:36.311
   He side-stepped you, man.

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:41.383
Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's it,
that's enough for today.
You take it in, go on.

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:47.856
Let's get two more in,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.641
Hey, coach.

01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:09.845
You don't think he's serious
about Travis playing, do you?

01:04:09.847 --> 01:04:13.048
     - That's what he said.
     - He's losing it.

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.317
I can't wait to
get to college ball.

01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:18.320
- No cripple-charity there.
- Are you high?

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:20.455
         Ain't nobody giving you
         a damn scholarship.

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:22.858
Just watch me, loser!
They love me!

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.693
     - I got three schools
     fighting over me.
     - You're crazy.

01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:27.829
     - Are you that dense?
     - What?

01:04:27.831 --> 01:04:28.964
                 You know coach.

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:31.533
       He says he's gonna
       do something, he does it.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:36.004
          If Travis plays badly,
          the whole offensive
          line looks bad.

01:04:36.006 --> 01:04:39.241
 - And if the line looks bad...
 - Wait a minute.

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:42.844
Yeah, Travis better learned
how to play center,

01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:45.747
or you can kiss
that scholarship goodbye!

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.423
             What?

01:04:58.328 --> 01:05:00.695
   Psst. Hey, mouse knuckle.

01:05:00.697 --> 01:05:04.199
What, who is it?
   - It's me, fool!

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:07.636
             What?

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:11.740
            - Jerry?
            - Yeah.

01:05:11.742 --> 01:05:13.742
What are you doing, man?
What time is it?

01:05:13.744 --> 01:05:15.877
           Don't worry about it,
           get some clothes on.

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:18.580
    - Grab your cleats.
    We're meeting somebody.
    - Who?

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:20.949
         You wouldn't believe me
         if I told you.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.787
      - Geez!
      - Easy, easy, easy.

01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:27.622
    Mind telling me
    where you're taking me?

01:05:27.624 --> 01:05:31.026
Jerry! Oh my gosh, clean out
your truck, this thing is nasty.

01:05:31.028 --> 01:05:33.261
           - Ashley.
           - Hi.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:37.198
  - You know what's going on?
  - No, not me,
  this is Jerry's idea.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.935
I ain't gonna have
you looking like crap out there.
You're better than that.

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:42.470
You're going to get this
center thing down, tonight.

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:45.607
          - Jerry...
          - Let's go!

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:48.310
      Is that moving?
      Oh my gosh, that's moving!

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:49.945
       - What's going on?
       - Whoa, whoa!

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:04.559
    - You guys are late.
    - Cameron?
    What are you doing here?

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:07.529
       I'm asking myself
       the same thing.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.535
            Come on.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:23.011
Hey, no beer tonight.
This is about him.

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:25.714
     It's always about him.

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:30.418
                        Come on.

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:44.933
Farris is putting you in a game,
so I ain't going to let you
make me look bad

01:06:44.935 --> 01:06:47.002
  by stinking up in the field.
  Got it?

01:06:47.004 --> 01:06:50.839
Aw, I think he
   kind of likes you.
Shut up, Baker!

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:56.111
             First, Travis,
             get in your stance.

01:06:56.113 --> 01:06:59.981
Wider, you got to have room
between your legs for that snap.
Come on!

01:06:59.983 --> 01:07:01.349
            - Hey!
            - Whoa!

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:02.617
    What, are you going
    to teach him something,

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:09.357
     you washed-up 2nd stringer?
     All right.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.860
           Now look, Travis, you
           got to use your feet.

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:14.829
Your feet need to be wider apart
than they normally used to.

01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:17.298
            Feel your balance
            through your cleats.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.667
                       Get down.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:23.371
  Now on the balls of your feet,
  you're moving forward. Good.

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:27.509
               Now dig in.
               Good, good, good.

01:07:27.511 --> 01:07:31.379
               Not bad, not bad.

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.548
       Now try it with the ball.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.951
        Here, there is the ball.

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:40.722
No, he can't do that.
You can't pick the ball up.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:44.526
              It's all right,
              just try it again.

01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:46.227
                 Just roll it to
                 find the laces.

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:49.831
                    Sweep, good.

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:52.901
             Get your other hand
             ready to fire out.

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:54.936
                         Dig in.

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:58.740
      - Yeah?
      - Let's try a snap.

01:07:58.742 --> 01:08:01.342
Here.

01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:04.179
You fart and I'll kill you.

01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:05.914
Hut.

01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:08.183
   - Aw, damn!
   - You okay? Sorry, sorry.

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:10.885
Aw, he's fine.
Will you shake it off,
2nd string.

01:08:10.887 --> 01:08:12.253
            You better cut
            the 2nd string crap.

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:13.555
        What are you
        going to do about it?

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:15.023
Guys, hey, do I have
to throw water on you all?

01:08:15.025 --> 01:08:18.193
Come on.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:19.594
    Go on and try it again.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:23.531
      Just gonna keep it slow,
      get the motion down first.

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:28.203
      Hut. Slow, you guys always
      have to rush things.

01:08:28.205 --> 01:08:30.238
                 No, stop, stop,
                 I got it.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.841
All right.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.542
                   Here it is,
                   try it again.

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:40.014
Hey.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.018
Relax.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.160
Hut.

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:53.862
One more time.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:55.997
Hut.

01:08:55.999 --> 01:08:58.233
Try it again.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:01.636
Hut.

01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:11.845
Hut.

01:09:11.848 --> 01:09:13.848
          That a boy.

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.688
                       Set. Hut!

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.626
You know, I could
have gone out, had coffee

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:28.729
and come back in the time it
took you to snap that ball.
Do it again.

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:35.236
                       Set. Hut!

01:09:37.372 --> 01:09:39.340
Keep doing it.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:45.013
                       Set. Hut!

01:09:45.015 --> 01:09:47.282
                           Down!

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:50.551
                       Set. Hut!

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.236
Travis.

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.375
     You know I don't need that.

01:10:47.377 --> 01:10:50.144
They don't know that.

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:12.233
<i>I am sure, Knox</i>
  <i> County is not expecting</i>
  <i> what they are getting.</i>

01:11:12.235 --> 01:11:16.304
 <i> The Corbin Redhound is</i>
 <i> romping and stomping tonight.</i>

01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:19.274
Get your hat on Freeman.
Now or never, you're in.

01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:21.142
    Kyle, I wanna see what
    you got at running back.

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:24.712
           Cameron you're
           moving to left guard,
           32 power and left.

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:26.581
Let's grind it out.
Come on, get in there.

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:31.085
      - This is it, baby.
      - Go, Travis!

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:37.925
Hey, don't screw up!

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:40.662
      Look, look, you see?

01:11:40.664 --> 01:11:43.298
     I am telling you,
     Coach Farris is crazy!

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.565
   Someone is gonna get hurt!

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:54.609
Down!

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:59.447
        Red 34, Red 34.

01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:02.150
           Set. Hut!

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:13.394
<i>Gain of 11 yards,</i>
 <i> 1st down Redhounds.</i>

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:19.534
    Not bad.
    Just like I taught you.

01:12:21.371 --> 01:12:24.005
<i>In the</i>
   <i> first game of the season,</i>

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:28.009
  <i> Corbin ain't missed a lick,</i>
  <i> mowing down opponents.</i>

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:29.677
    <i> Slicker'n goose grease.</i>

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:58.806
<i>Having</i>

      <i> on the team,</i>

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:02.844

    <i> of the game, all right.</i>

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:06.748
      <i> Corbin is playing</i>
      <i> inspired football.</i>

01:13:44.387 --> 01:13:46.587
             Ready!

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:50.224
              Set!

01:14:00.969 --> 01:14:02.737
You taking my job?

01:14:05.275 --> 01:14:07.141
             Jerry?

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:15.216
Jerry?

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:17.285
             What?

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.256
     - Where you been, man?
     - Here.

01:14:22.258 --> 01:14:25.993
You weren't at practice.
Where were you?

01:14:27.095 --> 01:14:29.831
                  Don't need it.
                  Don't play.

01:14:29.833 --> 01:14:35.069
      - What did you say?
      - Nothing.

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:38.673
Come on man, we're going
to grab a bite at the depot.

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:44.645
            Nah, you go ahead,
            I'm good where I am.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:49.350
You drinking?
Right out here?

01:14:49.352 --> 01:14:51.953
       This ain't drinking.
       It's my after school job.

01:14:51.955 --> 01:14:53.488
I smell beer.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.990
           I'm double checking
           the expiration dates.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:58.259
Are you trying to
get kicked off the team?

01:14:58.261 --> 01:15:01.796
              What team?
              Since fifth grade,

01:15:01.798 --> 01:15:04.999
          it's always been about
          Travis Freeman.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:07.835
             So go, go, big man.

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.505
                 Mr. Everything.

01:15:10.507 --> 01:15:12.473
         Ain't that what the
         paper used to call you?

01:15:12.475 --> 01:15:14.842
Why do you do this?

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:17.178
                You really have
                no idea, do you?

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.214
   - It's so easy for you.
   - Easy for me? I'm blind!

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:23.851
   Yeah, but, did that stop you?
   For one second?

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:26.187
                  No! It didn't.

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:29.290
       You play, you get grades,
       you go to college.

01:15:29.292 --> 01:15:31.792
      - Cut it out, Jerry.
      - You do it all.

01:15:31.794 --> 01:15:35.696
    What am I missing? Huh? Why?

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:38.599
I can't talk
to you like this.

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:43.504
               Hey, you want to
               know why I drink?

01:15:43.506 --> 01:15:46.040
              Because I like it.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:52.280
            Hey Trav, hey Trav,
            where are you going?

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:59.754
<i>The Redhounds have</i>
<i> run smack into a stubborn,</i>
<i> ornery Wildcat team.</i>

01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:04.058
 <i> And despite some uneven play,</i>
 <i> Corbin still has a chance</i>

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:06.227
     <i> to secure their place</i>
     <i> in the playoffs</i>

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.829
<i> by putting together a</i>
<i> fourth quarter touchdown drive</i>

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:09.897
       <i> to win this game.</i>

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:11.232
        What's the problem, ref?

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:12.867
Coach, we've got blood.
He's got to sit out a play.

01:16:12.869 --> 01:16:14.569
    - I'm fine!
    - You're my dang center.

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:15.770
          - I'm fine!
          - Let's go.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:17.438
There's no timeouts left.

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:20.741
     Freeman, get in there!

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:23.578
         Freeman! Hey!

01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:27.081
             Sorry!

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:28.849
Kyle!

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:34.755
              Hey!

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:37.391
     No, no, Kyle, get him.

01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:39.594
      What are you doing,
      get out of here!

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:40.628
                  Get off of me!

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:42.096
         Kyle, will you get him!

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:44.198
<i>There's</i>
 <i> some confusion on the field.</i>

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.167
             That's right, yeah.

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:51.606
<i>Wildcats show blitz.</i>

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.277
           Set. Hut!

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.825
I told you this would happen!

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:15.896
<i>Blue camp</i>
    <i> recovers the football.</i>

01:17:15.898 --> 01:17:19.667
 <i> Corbin is going to lose this</i>
 <i> game and fall to 5 and 2,</i>

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:23.804
<i> and miss the chance to secure</i>
<i> their place in the playoffs.</i>

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:26.007
Freddie?

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:33.681
This is not good.
Grab your bag.

01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:40.655
No, who is it?
    - Stay down, Freddie,
    stay down, stay down.

01:17:40.657 --> 01:17:43.624
Was that my fault?

01:17:43.626 --> 01:17:45.159
       - We are going
       to need stretcher.
       - Yes, sir.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:47.495
           It's okay, it's okay.

01:17:57.472 --> 01:17:59.607
Hey.

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:12.820
    - Trav, you ready to go?
    - Yes sir.

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:26.500
            - Dad.
            - Yeah?

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:50.825
<i>Well, for Corbin,</i>
 <i> it comes down to</i>
 <i> the last game of the season.</i>

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:54.428
 <i> Win, and they are in the</i>
 <i> playoffs for the first time</i>
 <i> in ten years.</i>

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:58.466
<i> Lose, and their season is over.</i>

01:18:59.334 --> 01:19:01.068
Hey Coach, can you
come in for a minute?

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:04.238
    - Can it wait?
    - I won't keep you long.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:10.211
        - Hello, Karen.
        - Hey, Coach.

01:19:10.213 --> 01:19:13.047
  - How's Freddie making out?
  - His leg's broke.

01:19:13.049 --> 01:19:17.785
  He's in traction for
  the next couple of weeks.
  But he's still making jokes.

01:19:17.787 --> 01:19:20.755
You tell him I'll be by
to see him again next week.

01:19:20.757 --> 01:19:22.757
        I was just telling Karen
        and Mr. Marshall here

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:25.459
    how I tried to keep
    Travis Freeman from playing.

01:19:25.461 --> 01:19:28.262
Well, I think Travis has
as much right to play as...

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:30.598
He doesn't have any right
to put those kids in danger!

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:33.067
   Freddie would be starting
   tonight if it wasn't
   for that boy!

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:36.771
   I'm afraid I agree.
   Now, I want your word you
   will not play that boy again.

01:19:36.773 --> 01:19:39.640
      - Are we done here?
      - I want your word.

01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:44.211
Look, folks,
I'm sorry about Freddie,

01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:46.447
but I don't blame
Travis for it.

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:49.817
It was a missed block,
it happens all the time.

01:19:49.819 --> 01:19:55.523
 You have a good game, because
 it's going to be your last.

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:09.170
Well, that's
not for you to say,
is it, Mr. Marshall?

01:20:09.172 --> 01:20:10.571
But I'll tell
you something.

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:13.808
If it is my last game,
win or lose,

01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:17.545
it's mine, not yours.

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.749
And it's not yours
neither, Jasper.

01:20:21.751 --> 01:20:26.887
So from now on just keep
your plays to yourself
and stay off my football field.

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:28.756
Karen.

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:36.030
          We got through to him.

01:20:50.612 --> 01:20:52.413
What's...

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:56.016
Whoa, ho, ho!
     Oh, yeah!

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:58.886
                       Whoo-hoo!

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:02.189
           - Jerry?
           - Shut up.

01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:03.290
You see what your doing?

01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:05.226
        Go, kick butt, Trav, go.

01:21:05.228 --> 01:21:06.493
                     I will now.

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:23.744
    - Are we still talking?
    - Well, that depends.

01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:25.145
On what?

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:32.486
Here, I want you
to have this.

01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:34.989
               What? What is it?

01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:37.558
It's that picture of us
they took when we were kids
in the end zone,

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.093
- the one they put in the paper?
- Why are you giving this to me?

01:21:39.095 --> 01:21:40.895
We signed it, man,
we were going
to sell it one day and...

01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:44.365
         - Why, Jerry?
         - I owe you.

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:48.002
     - You owe me for what?
     - I'm starting.

01:21:50.605 --> 01:21:52.573
       Do you think I let
       Freddie get hurt for you?

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:56.877
     - That's not what I...
     - You think coach
     wants to start you?

01:21:56.879 --> 01:22:00.247
 You're the best quarterback
 I've ever seen,
 and he doesn't want to use you.

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:03.751
       He doesn't have a choice!

01:22:03.753 --> 01:22:06.020
Travis, you're
not hearing me, okay?

01:22:06.022 --> 01:22:10.824
Jerry, coach wants to see you.

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:31.578
Come on in.

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:33.681
    Close it, park yourself.

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:40.454
I finally got through
to your ma at the hospital.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.289
She has to work
a double shift.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:44.425
            Why should this game
            be any different?

01:22:44.427 --> 01:22:47.695
She said to
wish you good luck.

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:53.634
You know, she works hard.

01:22:53.636 --> 01:22:58.339
She keeps that place running,
with all the doctors, nurses,

01:22:58.341 --> 01:23:00.474
and aides, they do just
what she tells them to do.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:05.713
And she never has
to raise her voice.
I admire that.

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:15.155
                        Coach...

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:17.791
                   ...are you...

01:23:17.793 --> 01:23:21.061
       Are you starting me
       just because you have to?

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:26.767
Don't you know me by now?

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:31.438
Hm?

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.941
Go on, get ready to play.

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.143
                       Yes, sir.

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.865
<i>Deep in</i>
      <i> the fourth quarter,</i>

01:23:57.867 --> 01:24:01.168
<i> and Corbin finds itself behind</i>
<i> in this must-win game.</i>

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:03.137
Full trips right,
27 traps, go on.

01:24:03.139 --> 01:24:05.005
<i>But the Redhounds</i>
 <i> are threatening.</i>

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.012
                       Watch 27.

01:24:12.014 --> 01:24:13.313
We need a win.

01:24:13.315 --> 01:24:15.382
We need to play some
football now, all right.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:16.683
Right 27.

01:24:16.685 --> 01:24:19.153
Kentucky, Kentucky.

01:24:19.155 --> 01:24:21.355
             Down.

01:24:21.357 --> 01:24:23.157
          Ready, team!

01:24:23.159 --> 01:24:25.325
        Ready, team!

01:24:25.327 --> 01:24:27.227
           Set. Hut.

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:43.243
 - Right 4 right, 80, all stop.
 - Yes, sir.

01:24:45.081 --> 01:24:47.381
<i>Corbin</i>
      <i> needs a touchdown.</i>

01:24:47.383 --> 01:24:52.086
<i> Three points and a tie doesn't</i>
<i> get them in the playoffs.</i>

01:24:52.088 --> 01:24:54.154
27.

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:58.692
  Come on, son, run the play.

01:24:58.694 --> 01:25:02.196
      Black 18, black 18.

01:25:02.198 --> 01:25:04.932
           Set. Hut!

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:13.107
<i>Drixon</i>
       <i> good for 7 yards.</i>

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:17.778
One timeout left, coach.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.447
<i>Drixon is hobbling</i>
 <i> back to the huddle.</i>

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:22.116
 <i> He's had a big game tonight.</i>

01:25:22.118 --> 01:25:24.451
  <i> Farris has been working him</i>

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:25.486
<i> like his brother-in-law's mule.</i>

01:25:28.724 --> 01:25:30.924
<i>Farris</i>
   <i> is letting the clock run.</i>

01:25:30.926 --> 01:25:33.460
   <i> He is not going to leave</i>
   <i> them Colonels any time,</i>

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:36.563
     <i> in case the Redhounds</i>
     <i> can score.</i>

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:40.467
       <i> Baker's got time.</i>

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:42.069
    <i> He's going for it all.</i>

01:25:42.071 --> 01:25:44.938
          <i> Oh, sugar!</i>

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:51.645
Boy, I tell you this
game's just making that
tri-tip just... hmmm.

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:53.580
<i>The clock stops</i>
  <i> with 34 seconds</i>

01:25:53.582 --> 01:25:55.516
        - You okay, man?
        - I'm good.

01:25:55.518 --> 01:25:58.152
<i>Corbin has</i>
    <i> just one timeout left.</i>

01:25:58.154 --> 01:26:01.588
We're going
bullets left, zip.
22 tackled trap, yeah?

01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:04.057
          - Yes, sir.
          - Go on.

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:08.195
      Black 15, black 15.

01:26:08.197 --> 01:26:10.264
           Set. Hut!

01:26:16.137 --> 01:26:18.772
<i>He's down to the 15.</i>
<i> Clock's running.</i>

01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:20.507
       Come on, move it,
       move it, move it.

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:22.209
<i>Farris lets Baker</i>

01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:24.611
<i> get his team back to the line.</i>

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:28.515
- You know it, do it, do it.
<i>- No huddle.</i>

01:26:28.517 --> 01:26:29.883
      Kentucky, Kentucky.

01:26:29.885 --> 01:26:32.052
<i>Boy, Drixon's</i>
   <i> really limping now.</i>

01:26:32.054 --> 01:26:34.521
<i> - Split out left.</i>
- Kentucky.

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:36.156
             Down.

01:26:36.158 --> 01:26:38.058
           Set. Hut!

01:26:44.133 --> 01:26:46.533
          Draw, draw!

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:49.036
Time!

01:26:49.038 --> 01:26:52.039
       Timeout, timeout!

01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:54.741
<i>And Corbin takes</i>
  <i> its last timeout.</i>

01:26:54.743 --> 01:26:58.645
      <i> Give me a root beer</i>
      <i> and a sack of nuts.</i>

01:26:58.647 --> 01:27:01.248
      <i> There's time</i>
      <i> for one last play!</i>

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.050
          - This game!
          - Wow!

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.056
You all right, man?
You okay? Come on.

01:27:10.826 --> 01:27:13.060
               Coach, he's done.

01:27:13.062 --> 01:27:15.329
All right,
well, you take a seat, son.

01:27:15.331 --> 01:27:19.032
Offense! Bring it in.

01:27:19.034 --> 01:27:25.005
    - Twins left, 48 sweep.
    - All right.

01:27:27.775 --> 01:27:29.543
  Kyle, I am going to need you
  to run the ball.

01:27:29.545 --> 01:27:34.081
 - Yes, sir.
 - Freeman,
 you got one last play in you?

01:27:34.083 --> 01:27:35.249
                    You kidding?

01:27:35.251 --> 01:27:39.753
       We're going to
       run twins, left 48 sweep.

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:41.121
          - Kyle.
          - Yes, sir.

01:27:41.123 --> 01:27:42.589
               Don't you take
               all day about it.

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:44.758
            You turn that corner
            and bully your way

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.326
             into that end zone.

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:51.064
       Take a look at the
       guys around you.

01:27:51.066 --> 01:27:55.702
    Make sure when you walk
    off this field tonight,
    you've given your best.

01:27:55.704 --> 01:27:58.805
       That you can hold
       your head up high.

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:05.045
       It's been an honor
       to coach you boys.

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:08.915
            Travis?

01:28:08.917 --> 01:28:12.052
        Redhound pride on three!

01:28:12.054 --> 01:28:15.422
- One, two, three!
- Redhound Pride!

01:28:15.424 --> 01:28:17.124
Go.

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:21.395
             You got this, Trav.

01:28:25.067 --> 01:28:27.634
                All right, boys,
                here we go.

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:29.102
                     Twins left.

01:28:29.104 --> 01:28:32.339
       No, check that,
       let's run something else.

01:28:32.341 --> 01:28:35.776
  - Are you serious?
  - Cameron, you're at center.
  Kyle, you are at guard.

01:28:35.778 --> 01:28:39.746
               Travis, you're in
               the backfield.

01:28:39.748 --> 01:28:42.749
Wait, what? Jerry.

01:28:42.751 --> 01:28:44.584
You're not screwing this up!
Run the damn play.

01:28:44.586 --> 01:28:47.321
Hey, there is no damn
    way in hell Kyle can score
    in a sweep.

01:28:47.323 --> 01:28:50.657
          And you know that.
          But Travis can run
          23 Blast in his sleep!

01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:53.527
    - But the handoff, man.
    - Don't worry about it,
    I'll get you the ball.

01:28:53.529 --> 01:28:58.865
     All you gotta do is run
     straight ahead. You can run
     a straight line, can't you?

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:03.937
 - Why are you doing this, man?
 - 'Cause I'm the quarterback.

01:29:03.939 --> 01:29:07.774
          And you,
          you're Travis Freeman.

01:29:07.776 --> 01:29:09.776
                    Make a hole!

01:29:09.778 --> 01:29:12.879
         Hit that linebacker
         like he's your old man.

01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:18.118
      - Let's do it, boys.
      - Sweet.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.620
- 23 Blast on 1. Ready?
- Break!

01:29:22.624 --> 01:29:23.990
<i>Fasten your</i>

01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:37.137
 - Travis is in the backfield!
 - He's what?

01:29:37.139 --> 01:29:40.741
       - What the hell?!
       - No, he didn't!

01:29:40.743 --> 01:29:42.376
Yeah, he did.

01:29:57.425 --> 01:29:58.392

  <i> - Feel your balance...</i>
  <i> - I think you should play.</i>

      - Set!

01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:32.092
      <i> - Travis Freeman...</i>
      <i> - ...and myself...</i>

01:30:32.094 --> 01:30:35.395
