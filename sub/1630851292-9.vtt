19:19.734 --> 19:21.066
Funny thing about that.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.661
I got a friend at the harbor
who owed me one.

19:27.074 --> 19:30.317
-Thanks, pal.
-Anytime, Mac.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.244
Oh, Mac, you saved us.

19:32.397 --> 19:34.154
Yeah. Your daughter
is still dead,

19:34.248 --> 19:35.989
but you get to continue
to outlive her,

19:36.009 --> 19:37.900
which is every mom's dream.

19:37.919 --> 19:39.585
Oh, just shut up and kiss me.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.587
You got it, sweetheart.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.406
Mmm.

19:45.576 --> 19:48.594
<i> Soon, we'd be engaged,</i>

20:09.209 --> 20:11.434
Sorry for not
believing you, Mac.

20:11.527 --> 20:14.119
But thanks to you, the real
murderer is behind bars.

20:14.214 --> 20:17.957
And the Greater Boston area
has seen its last bad priest.

20:18.109 --> 20:19.625
So, what's gonna happen
to Marion?

20:19.719 --> 20:23.370
Well, he's a lunatic murderer
who cross-dresses in the '30s.

20:23.464 --> 20:25.556
My guess is he can
look forward to a life

20:25.783 --> 20:30.019
of loony bin craft projects
and staring out at the sea.

20:32.457 --> 20:33.806
You think that place
can hold me?

20:33.958 --> 20:36.459
You're dead, copper.
You're all dead.

20:36.552 --> 20:38.069
But all that's after
the castration

20:38.220 --> 20:40.404
and full frontal lobotomy.

20:40.631 --> 20:42.740
Wait, what?
