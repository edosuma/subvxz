01:49.057 --> 01:51.893
Happy Thanksgiving!

01:54.771 --> 01:55.773
Come here!

01:59.443 --> 02:00.486
- Yeah!
Right here!

02:00.611 --> 02:02.279
Toss me a bird, Bumpy!

02:02.404 --> 02:03.782
Bumpy!

02:05.241 --> 02:07.077
- Yeah!
Bumpy! We love you!

02:07.202 --> 02:08.787
There you go, darling.

02:10.413 --> 02:12.166
Over here! Over here!

02:15.753 --> 02:17.588
Frank! Come on!

02:18.130 --> 02:19.256
Come here.

02:32.021 --> 02:36.235
This is the problem.
This is what's wrong with America.

02:37.111 --> 02:40.572
It's gotten so big,
you just can't find your way.

02:41.490 --> 02:45.495
The grocery store
on the corner is now a supermarket.

02:45.745 --> 02:48.915
The candy store is a McDonald's.

02:50.291 --> 02:53.963
And this place,
a super-fucking discount store.

02:54.338 --> 02:57.258
Where's the pride of ownership, huh?

02:58.676 --> 03:00.470
Where's the personal service?

03:07.602 --> 03:10.273
You see what I mean? Shit.

03:12.775 --> 03:16.780
I mean, what right do they have,
of cutting out the suppliers,

03:17.156 --> 03:20.325
pushing out all the middlemen,

03:20.951 --> 03:24.455
buying direct from the manufacturer?

03:25.915 --> 03:29.210
Sony this, Toshiba that.

03:29.419 --> 03:33.299
All them Chinks
putting Americans out of work.

03:40.473 --> 03:42.434
That's the way it is now.

03:45.937 --> 03:47.564
You all right?

03:47.773 --> 03:50.443
You can't find the heart of anything

03:52.278 --> 03:54.072
to stick the knife.

03:56.699 --> 03:57.785
Hey!

03:58.410 --> 04:00.162
Anybody here?

04:00.788 --> 04:01.789
Can I help you?

04:01.914 --> 04:03.248
Call an ambulance.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.085
Forget it, Frank.

04:06.628 --> 04:08.880
There's no one in charge.

04:13.844 --> 04:15.513
Call an ambulance!

04:16.721 --> 04:19.141
Some say
Bumpy Johnson was a great man,

04:19.266 --> 04:22.604
according to the eulogies, a giving man,
a man of the people.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.398
No one chose to use in their remembrances

04:24.523 --> 04:28.610
the word most often associated with
Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson, "Gangster,"

04:28.735 --> 04:32.323
whose passing has brought a who's who
of mourners on this chilly afternoon.

04:32.448 --> 04:36.661
Lucchese mob boss Dominic Cattano,
Harlem crime figure Nicky Barnes.

04:36.786 --> 04:37.830
Nicky! Nicky!

04:37.955 --> 04:39.081
From the political arena,

04:39.206 --> 04:41.583
the Governor has come down,
the Mayor of New York,

04:41.708 --> 04:46.047
and Chief of Police and Commissioner,
sports and entertainment luminaries:

04:46.423 --> 04:49.342
Bumpy Johnson,
age 62 when he passed,

04:49.467 --> 04:52.971
was a folk hero among
Harlem locals for over four decades:

04:53.096 --> 04:55.474
Regarded by some
as the Robin Hood of Harlem,

04:55.599 --> 04:57.435
by others as a ruthless criminal:::

04:57.560 --> 04:59.270
I don't understand, you know.

04:59.395 --> 05:03.608
I would've thought that Bumpy would
put out a better spread, you know?

05:03.734 --> 05:05.569
- You want something?
- No, thanks.

05:05.777 --> 05:07.320
I want chicken wings at my funeral.

05:07.446 --> 05:09.949
All right, Nicky Barnes.
Who is that?

05:10.074 --> 05:11.784
He didn't know what hit him,
you know what I'm saying?

05:11.909 --> 05:14.203
I just kept popping him
in the face 'cause that's what I do.

05:16.748 --> 05:17.958
Mmm.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.713
I don't have a lighter. You have a light?

05:26.050 --> 05:27.135
Oh.

05:33.893 --> 05:34.894
Okay?

05:35.311 --> 05:36.979
That's very good.

05:37.521 --> 05:38.814
Hey, Frank.

05:41.150 --> 05:43.904
Go get me a light while you're at it.

05:45.322 --> 05:46.948
Appreciate it.

05:47.824 --> 05:49.159
Don Cattano.

05:49.284 --> 05:51.370
Hey, how you doing, Rossi?

05:51.496 --> 05:52.747
Good.

05:52.872 --> 05:54.040
Would you like a drink, sir?

05:54.165 --> 05:56.876
Give him a scotch on the rocks.

06:02.007 --> 06:04.051
Come on. Come on.

06:13.311 --> 06:15.481
I know you're hurting, Frank.

06:16.190 --> 06:17.274
So am I.

06:17.817 --> 06:18.943
I'm all right.

06:19.485 --> 06:21.570
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

06:21.904 --> 06:24.324
I'm sure Bumpy didn't say
anything to you, but he made me promise

06:24.449 --> 06:26.701
that if anything ever happened to him,

06:26.827 --> 06:29.996
that I should make sure
that you want for nothing.

06:31.290 --> 06:32.917
I appreciate that.

06:33.584 --> 06:37.255
You know, half the people in this room
owed Bumpy money when he died.

06:37.380 --> 06:40.509
They think I'm gonna forget to collect,
but I'm gonna get that money.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.720
Well, that's the spirit. Go get 'em.

06:46.975 --> 06:49.067
Mr Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,

06:49.102 --> 06:50.645
Mr Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,

06:50.812 --> 06:54.942
give us US v: Mead,
subject, issues, what the determination was

06:55.067 --> 06:57.528
and what it means to us today.

06:57.987 --> 07:02.492
Class, you'll be critiquing Mr Roberts,
so pay attention.

07:04.828 --> 07:06.955
I hate hearing my name called,
you know?

07:07.080 --> 07:09.958
It means I gotta get up in front of the class,
I gotta turn around,

07:10.083 --> 07:14.172
and I know every one of those people there,
they know more than I do.

07:14.338 --> 07:18.301
The number one fear of people,
it ain't dying, it's public speaking.

07:18.426 --> 07:19.803
I get physically ill, I wanna throw up.

07:19.928 --> 07:21.680
And that's what you wanna do for a living.

07:21.847 --> 07:23.974
No, I don't wanna be like that, man,
I wanna beat it.

07:24.099 --> 07:25.142
So, should I do this?

07:25.267 --> 07:27.645
No, he'll take it from me, he knows me.
I've known him since high school.

07:27.771 --> 07:30.190
- From high school?
- Good morning. Yeah.

07:30.315 --> 07:32.358
He doesn't take it, just throw it in.
It's good service.

07:32.525 --> 07:34.987
- Throw it in? All right.
- Yeah.

07:36.030 --> 07:37.865
What's up, Susie?
- Hey, Jay.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.867
- How you doing, baby?
- All right.

07:40.034 --> 07:41.327
All right. Ready?

07:58.931 --> 08:00.015
Hey! That's his head!

08:07.899 --> 08:11.653
You're supposed to be my friend,
asshole!

08:12.570 --> 08:14.864
CAMPIZl: I swear to God, Richie,
I didn't know it was you.

08:14.990 --> 08:18.369
I would never slam a door
on your hand, knowingly.

08:18.494 --> 08:19.578
You bit my fucking hand.

08:19.703 --> 08:21.372
What are you doing
serving subpoenas, anyway?

08:21.539 --> 08:23.500
We're on loan to County.
- County?

08:23.625 --> 08:25.669
- How's that working out for you?
Hey, fuck you.

08:25.794 --> 08:29.881
Hey, I'm sorry. Consider me served.
Can we leave it there?

08:30.006 --> 08:32.885
Assault on a police officer? I don't think so.

08:33.010 --> 08:36.722
Hey, for old times' sake. What can we do?
What do you want? What can I give you?

08:36.847 --> 08:39.142
What do you get for assault
with a deadly weapon, Jay?

08:39.268 --> 08:41.102
- Five years minimum.
Five years.

08:41.227 --> 08:45.357
Guys, come on. No, guys.
What do you want? Who do you want?

08:45.691 --> 08:46.900
Who do you got?

08:47.067 --> 08:51.656
You want Big Al's bookie? You want
his accountant? I'll give him to you.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.251
CAMPIZl: Stop, stop, stop.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.546
There he is.

09:07.048 --> 09:09.217
That's him. That's the bookie.

09:09.342 --> 09:11.052
All right, Carlo, get lost.

09:11.178 --> 09:12.764
- Right here?
- Yeah, right here. Get out of the car.

09:12.889 --> 09:16.684
CAMPIZl: This is... I'd rather not.
Come on. Let's go.

09:16.809 --> 09:18.519
Take it ease.

09:38.167 --> 09:40.127
Want to stay with him or the car?

09:40.294 --> 09:42.755
Let's see who comes for the car.

09:57.313 --> 09:58.981
Think he made us?

09:59.440 --> 10:01.860
You called in the warrants, right?
So, where are they?

10:01.985 --> 10:03.487
I just called, man.

10:03.612 --> 10:07.407
I called and walked back here
and 10 seconds has gone by.

10:09.911 --> 10:11.746
I saw him with the slips, Jay.

10:11.871 --> 10:15.542
You saw policy slips? You saw
grocery bags. You don't know what's in 'em.

10:15.667 --> 10:18.045
Yes, I do and so do you.
Don't give me that bull.

10:18.170 --> 10:21.132
What's the rush, Richie?
Half an hour, the warrant will be here.

10:21.257 --> 10:25.011
- I got night school, all right?
- Guess you're gonna miss it.

10:32.645 --> 10:34.439
Fuck this. Come on.
- You sure?

10:34.564 --> 10:36.524
Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go.

11:29.584 --> 11:30.919
Fuck.

11:32.670 --> 11:34.047
- Jay.
- Yeah?

11:40.429 --> 11:41.722
Fuck.

11:46.061 --> 11:48.355
WBZ, honey bunch,
the show they all love!

11:48.480 --> 11:50.774
It's the groovy sound
of the Jefferson Kaye Saturday Night Show:

11:50.899 --> 11:53.069
Dig, honey, it's coming up time for news:

11:53.194 --> 11:55.822
Jumping on the ceiling,
wallpaper peeling on WBZ:

11:55.947 --> 11:58.282
Stick around, the Jace-man's got 10:
Back in 10:

12:05.999 --> 12:07.501
It's not just a couple of bucks, all right?

12:07.626 --> 12:09.254
It's the same thing in principle.

12:10.338 --> 12:11.548
Oh, are we talking principles?

12:11.673 --> 12:15.385
Richie, a cop who turns
in this kind of money, says one thing.

12:15.510 --> 12:18.973
He turns in cops who take money.
We'll be fucking pariahs.

12:19.098 --> 12:20.516
Yeah, well, then we're fucked both ways.

12:20.641 --> 12:23.394
Not if we keep it. Only if we don't,
then you're right, we're fucked.

12:23.519 --> 12:25.397
But not if we keep it.

12:26.314 --> 12:28.692
God damn it, man! Did we ask for this?

12:28.817 --> 12:31.778
Did we put a gun to someone's head
and say, "Give us your money"?

12:31.903 --> 12:35.658
Cops kill cops they can't trust.

12:39.245 --> 12:41.290
We can't turn it in, man.

12:50.592 --> 12:52.385
Can you believe that?

13:01.395 --> 13:03.022
How much is it?

13:03.606 --> 13:05.942
$987,000.

13:07.944 --> 13:10.572
Well, what happened to the rest of it?

13:12.616 --> 13:15.328
What the hell are you doing
counting it out here in front of everybody?

13:15.453 --> 13:16.871
Are you nuts?

13:17.747 --> 13:22.002
Get it back in the bags, seal them up
and down into the property room.

13:31.429 --> 13:33.431
You fucking Boy Scout.

13:57.542 --> 14:00.670
What? What?

14:24.363 --> 14:26.658
Detective Trupo, sign here.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.664
You guys ready to make
a lot of fucking money?

14:32.789 --> 14:34.124
Always.
Hell, yeah.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.334
Fucking A.

14:37.837 --> 14:38.963
Oh, look at this.

14:39.130 --> 14:40.214
There you go.

14:40.882 --> 14:43.719
All right, look at this.
Fucking beautiful.

14:43.886 --> 14:45.679
There's three more boats.

14:53.229 --> 14:55.398
Hey, don't lose any of that shit.

14:55.565 --> 14:57.859
I know.
All right, be careful.

15:01.113 --> 15:03.324
Hey! Just enough for the reagent test.

15:05.159 --> 15:06.870
A little less.

15:12.584 --> 15:14.879
ROSSl: This is the French Connection dope:

15:15.004 --> 15:19.300
Kilos of the same dope
Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso took from us:

15:19.425 --> 15:21.677
The cops seize it, arrest everyone,

15:21.803 --> 15:24.181
then they start taking it out
of the evidence room,

15:24.306 --> 15:27.768
whacking it down to nothing
and selling it back to us:

15:27.893 --> 15:30.270
They basically control the market with it:

15:30.395 --> 15:32.941
Mr Rossi, I have a surprise for you.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.069
ROSSl: They've been doing it for years now:
They live off it, our dope:

15:36.194 --> 15:37.195
What do you think?

15:37.320 --> 15:39.156
What the fuck is happening
to the world, Frank?

15:39.657 --> 15:41.534
Those fucking crooks.

15:41.659 --> 15:43.744
Yeah. Sad about Bumpy.

15:46.247 --> 15:48.500
Things are never gonna
be the same in Harlem.

15:48.625 --> 15:53.630
You walk down the street, nobody bothers
you 'cause Bumpy was making sure of it.

15:53.839 --> 15:55.258
Half a key.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.552
How is your day now?

15:58.427 --> 16:00.221
It's chaos. Every gorilla for hisself.

16:03.183 --> 16:04.852
Motherfucker!

16:07.688 --> 16:11.276
Who can live like that?
There has to be order.

16:11.568 --> 16:13.528
That would never happen with Italians.

16:13.653 --> 16:17.365
More important than any one man's life,
is order.

16:25.583 --> 16:26.750
Frank.

16:27.669 --> 16:30.338
Hey. Come on in, Claude. Sit down.

16:35.761 --> 16:37.430
How y'all doing, huh?
- Good.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.931
So, you see Nate over there? Yeah?

16:39.056 --> 16:40.349
Yeah, all the time.

16:40.475 --> 16:42.518
- Nate is everywhere. He's good.
- Yeah.

16:42.643 --> 16:44.813
- He's still over there?
- Yeah. He's got himself a club now.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.441
- Okay. Whereabouts, Saigon?
Bangkok.

16:47.566 --> 16:50.569
- Bangkok?
- I don't think he's ever coming home.

16:54.824 --> 16:55.950
Come on.

17:22.438 --> 17:25.192
On the house, for our boys in uniform.

17:25.317 --> 17:28.278
Thank you, sugar. That's very kind.

17:28.904 --> 17:30.155
Thank Frank.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.740
Thanks, Frank.

17:33.117 --> 17:34.744
Just relax.

17:35.829 --> 17:38.873
You have to boot this shit a couple of times.

17:39.582 --> 17:42.962
The cops keep cutting it, selling the shit.

17:45.214 --> 17:48.176
I don't want to say anything,
'cause the price is right,

17:48.301 --> 17:51.471
but that shit in Nam is way,

17:52.639 --> 17:56.269
way heavy.

18:20.170 --> 18:23.257
Did you ain't seen the jar, Frank?

18:23.382 --> 18:26.177
I think you walked right past it.

18:26.302 --> 18:30.223
The money jar, Frank.
What do I gotta do, put a fucking sign on it?

18:30.348 --> 18:31.433
Hmm?

18:34.686 --> 18:36.814
Look at this nigger right here.
You know, Frank,

18:36.939 --> 18:39.108
Bumpy don't own 116th no more.

18:39.358 --> 18:41.110
Bumpy don't own
no real estate in Harlem right now.

18:41.235 --> 18:44.030
I'm the landlord and the lease is 20%.

18:45.574 --> 18:48.869
Look, don't sell dope then, Frank.
Get a real job.

18:48.994 --> 18:52.122
You need a fucking job, Frank?
Hmm? Is that what you need?

18:52.247 --> 18:53.541
Well, you can come work for me.

18:53.708 --> 18:56.669
Okay? You can drive me around, huh?
You can open my doors.

18:56.794 --> 19:01.717
Huh? "Yes, sir", "No, sir", "Right away, sir",
"Anything you want, Massa Johnson".

19:04.220 --> 19:05.721
Twenty percent.

19:12.771 --> 19:15.315
Twenty percent is my profit, Tango.

19:17.443 --> 19:19.570
If I give you that, then what do I got left?
Nothing, man.

19:19.695 --> 19:21.072
Twenty percent puts me out of business,

19:21.239 --> 19:23.366
and every somebody
you know out of business.

19:23.491 --> 19:26.537
There's legitimate ways of doing things,
Tango, and then there's this way.

19:26.662 --> 19:28.831
Not even Bumpy took 20%.

19:28.956 --> 19:30.874
Bumpy's fucking dead.

19:34.295 --> 19:35.588
My man.

19:36.089 --> 19:37.382
Twenty percent?

19:46.016 --> 19:47.017
Twenty percent.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.102
Doc, let's go.

20:06.540 --> 20:09.334
Out: Good job: Sit:

20:11.044 --> 20:14.841
A leader, like a shepherd,

20:15.049 --> 20:18.011
he sends his fastest nimble sheep,
out front:

20:18.136 --> 20:19.929
And the others will follow.

20:20.054 --> 20:23.475
While the shepherd,
he walks quietly behind it.

20:23.601 --> 20:26.729
Here, boy! Here we go. Right here.
Bring it here. Yeah.

20:27.688 --> 20:31.902
Now he's got the stick, and the cane,
he'll use it!

20:32.652 --> 20:34.362
If he has to.

20:34.487 --> 20:36.823
But most times he doesn't have to.

20:36.948 --> 20:40.703
He moves the whole herd quietly.

20:43.581 --> 20:48.003
What right do they have
cutting out the supplier?

20:48.253 --> 20:50.756
The middleman. Buying direct.

20:52.674 --> 20:55.428
Putting Americans out of work.

20:56.137 --> 20:58.389
That's the way it is now, Frank.

21:00.934 --> 21:02.770
That's the way it is.

21:19.622 --> 21:23.251
The drug problem
in Vietnam is more than marijuana:

21:23.376 --> 21:26.171
At this point, it is estimated that one third
of American troops are experimenting

21:26.296 --> 21:28.173
with opium and heroin:

21:31.051 --> 21:32.135
The authorities say
they have confiscated

21:32.261 --> 21:35.765
large quantities of marijuana,
heroin and pills:

21:36.140 --> 21:38.977
Every person and every vehicle
going through the gates

21:39.102 --> 21:41.312
is subject to a thorough shakedown:

21:41.479 --> 21:45.234
Soldiers have access to
the drugs at many rest and relaxation spots

21:45.359 --> 21:49.405
in Bangkok, Saigon and other areas
throughout Vietnam and Thailand:

21:49.530 --> 21:53.618
Officials say the easy availability,
relatively cheap cost

21:53.743 --> 21:57.414
and high purity of heroin
throughout Saigon and the Far East,

21:57.539 --> 22:01.460
is leading to an epidemic
of heroin addiction among US soldiers:

22:05.131 --> 22:07.176
- Operator:
Yeah, international.

22:07.342 --> 22:09.553
- What city?
- Bangkok.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.472
- You know the country code?
- Yeah, 376.

22:12.764 --> 22:17.145
- For the first three minutes, it'll be:::
- I got it, I got it. I got it.

22:21.941 --> 22:22.943
Hello?

22:23.068 --> 22:24.570
Soul Brothers: Hey, can I help you?

22:24.695 --> 22:25.863
Nate.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.157
- Do I know you?
- Yeah, it's me.

22:28.324 --> 22:30.869
- Who?
- Me, Frank. Your cousin, negro.

22:35.248 --> 22:36.875
Go on, get yourself a new suit.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.126
Look, I'm sorry.

23:15.252 --> 23:16.628
Oh, please, Richie.

23:17.170 --> 23:20.758
It couldn't be avoided.
I'll take him next weekend, all right?

23:20.925 --> 23:22.468
We're moving.

23:22.593 --> 23:24.554
What? Where?

23:26.055 --> 23:28.433
The St Regis. What do you care?

23:30.936 --> 23:32.396
To my sister's.

23:32.521 --> 23:34.815
- Your sister's? In Vegas?
- Yeah.

23:34.941 --> 23:37.402
You are not moving to Las Vegas.
Not with Michael, anyway.

23:38.736 --> 23:41.948
What am I supposed to do with him,
leave him with you? There's a picture.

23:43.325 --> 23:45.119
Hey, guys! Be cool.

23:47.663 --> 23:51.167
Laurie, Las Vegas is not
the kind of place that you raise a kid.

23:51.293 --> 23:54.462
Like this is a good environment?
And around your friends?

23:54.629 --> 23:56.423
When am I supposed to see my boy?

23:56.548 --> 23:58.675
This weekend. Last weekend.

24:00.219 --> 24:01.721
God damn it.

24:01.846 --> 24:04.473
Hey! I asked you nice to shut up, right?

24:04.599 --> 24:05.683
Now I'm gonna have to kill you.

24:05.850 --> 24:09.062
I swear I will pull out my gun
and put a bullet in your fucking heads!

24:09.187 --> 24:11.148
Now stop what you're doing
and pick up the glass!

24:11.315 --> 24:13.609
Calm down, man. Okay, be cool.

24:16.362 --> 24:17.822
Fucking crazy, man.

24:19.282 --> 24:20.992
You don't have a gun.

24:23.829 --> 24:25.080
You sure?

24:33.173 --> 24:35.008
You are crazy, Richie.

24:39.304 --> 24:41.432
You don't have room for us.

24:43.184 --> 24:45.019
I'll see you in court.

24:46.729 --> 24:48.315
Come on, Michael.

24:48.690 --> 24:50.442
Say bye to your dad.

24:51.735 --> 24:53.779
- Get over here.
- Hey, kiddo.

24:55.239 --> 24:58.660
I'll see you next week, all right?
We'll do something.

24:59.494 --> 25:01.538
Let's get you an ice cream.

25:26.399 --> 25:30.612
You have 10 minutes remaining.
Ten minutes.

26:36.436 --> 26:39.481
Shake it, baby.
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

26:43.819 --> 26:46.614
Oh, come on, girl. Don't tell me $5
don't get me a little something.

26:46.739 --> 26:49.493
Can you dig that it costs money
to be here?

26:49.618 --> 26:51.328
Oh, come on, girl.

27:24.907 --> 27:26.951
How much you want, Frank?

27:27.702 --> 27:29.663
Tell him I want 100 keys.

27:31.832 --> 27:34.543
Frank, ain't nobody I know
can get you that much personally, all right?

27:34.710 --> 27:36.545
You're gonna have to
piece it together from several sources,

27:36.670 --> 27:38.172
and it's not gonna be 100% pure.

27:38.298 --> 27:40.049
I don't want that.

27:40.592 --> 27:42.218
I know what you don't want, Frank,

27:42.385 --> 27:47.016
but look, what you're gonna need is to get
to the Chiu-Chou syndicate, all right?

27:47.224 --> 27:49.602
Cholon, Saigon.
If they're gonna deal with you at all.

27:49.768 --> 27:52.062
I understand that,
but by then it's gonna be too late.

27:52.187 --> 27:54.733
It'll be already chopped up.
I wanna go get it where they go get it from.

27:54.900 --> 27:55.901
I wanna go to the source.

27:56.067 --> 27:59.154
- So, you're gonna go get it yourself?
- Why not?

27:59.321 --> 28:01.616
Huh? I came this far.

28:02.408 --> 28:03.826
You're gonna go
into the motherfucking jungle?

28:03.951 --> 28:05.286
I'm in the jungle. Look around.

28:05.411 --> 28:07.204
They're eating these roaches
and whatever that is.

28:07.330 --> 28:08.998
Nigga, I'm talking about snakes, all right?

28:09.123 --> 28:10.834
I'm talking about tigers,
I'm talking about Vietcong,

28:11.001 --> 28:14.671
I'm talking about mosquitoes
that'll fucking kill your ass.

28:15.797 --> 28:16.965
You wanna go into the jungle?

28:17.090 --> 28:18.718
We're going.

28:20.720 --> 28:21.971
- Fuck it. Let's go.
- We're going.

28:22.138 --> 28:23.139
Why not? Let's go.

29:06.313 --> 29:07.940
Hey, Frank.

29:08.482 --> 29:11.569
This whole spot's locked down
by the Kuomintang,

29:13.153 --> 29:15.865
General Chiang Kai-shek's defeated army.

29:54.367 --> 29:56.745
How would you get it into the States?

29:56.870 --> 29:58.663
You ain't got to worry about that.

29:58.788 --> 29:59.873
Who do you work for in there?

30:00.040 --> 30:02.585
You ain't got to worry about that, either.

30:02.710 --> 30:04.503
Who are you, really?

30:05.087 --> 30:07.214
Frank Lucas,
says it right there in my passport.

30:07.381 --> 30:09.050
I mean, who you represent?

30:09.175 --> 30:10.176
Me.

30:12.387 --> 30:16.141
You think you're going
to take 100 kilos of heroin into the US,

30:16.266 --> 30:20.188
and you don't work for anyone?
Someone is going to allow that?

30:20.396 --> 30:21.397
That's right.

30:28.864 --> 30:34.788
After this first purchase,
if you are not killed by Marseille importers,

30:34.913 --> 30:40.126
or their people in the States, then what?

30:40.377 --> 30:43.881
Then there will be more,
much more, I guarantee it.

30:44.048 --> 30:45.216
And if it's all the same to you,

30:45.383 --> 30:48.719
I don't wanna have to drag my ass up here
no more.

30:48.844 --> 30:50.388
Of course not.

30:53.225 --> 30:54.393
My man.

30:55.269 --> 30:57.145
- Soul brother, huh?
- Soul brother.

31:39.652 --> 31:44.365
Fifty grand. It's gonna cover them
and the pilot and the boys on the other end.

31:44.949 --> 31:46.743
Give them a hundred.

31:47.328 --> 31:49.204
Fifty is gonna cover it, Frank.

31:49.371 --> 31:52.041
Give them a hundred,
give them the whole thing. Here.

31:52.166 --> 31:53.417
And look,

31:54.335 --> 31:58.715
that's all I got.
So, if that dope don't arrive for any reason...

32:02.093 --> 32:06.098
Hey, listen, cousin or no cousin,
I'm a busy man, all right?

32:06.223 --> 32:09.477
I ain't got no time
to be going to nobody's funeral.

32:09.936 --> 32:12.564
I'll let you know when it's in the air.

32:12.689 --> 32:13.774
My man.

32:27.831 --> 32:29.166
Fuck.

32:37.634 --> 32:38.718
Richie?
- Yeah.

32:38.843 --> 32:40.011
This fucking guy made me:

32:40.136 --> 32:42.514
I don't know how he did, but he did.

32:42.639 --> 32:43.891
He went for his gun:

32:44.308 --> 32:45.726
I had to do it, man.

32:45.851 --> 32:47.728
There's 100 people
out there that heard the shots.

32:47.853 --> 32:49.981
You gotta help me. You gotta do something.

32:50.147 --> 32:51.817
Baby.

32:51.942 --> 32:52.943
Where are you, Jay?

32:54.403 --> 32:56.029
That's the problem.

32:59.157 --> 33:02.745
Dispatch, I got a 10-13. I got a 10-13.

33:02.912 --> 33:04.872
Copy that: What's your 20?

33:05.290 --> 33:06.624
Tower two.

33:08.335 --> 33:09.962
Apartment 1G.

33:10.671 --> 33:12.464
Kent and West in the projects.

33:12.590 --> 33:13.966
Identify yourself, please:

33:14.091 --> 33:15.342
Detective Richie Roberts.

33:15.509 --> 33:18.430
That's a negative: I got no units in that area:

33:18.555 --> 33:19.889
Bullshit.

33:20.098 --> 33:22.642
Please put the call out again.
I'm gonna need assistance.

33:22.809 --> 33:24.854
Detective Roberts,
I got no units in that area:

33:25.021 --> 33:26.647
- Fuck you.
- That's a negative:

33:37.701 --> 33:39.077
I didn't mention no cops.
Know what I'm saying?

33:39.202 --> 33:40.288
You know what I'm saying?

33:40.455 --> 33:42.332
I'll get the motherfucker!
Kick his ass!

33:42.457 --> 33:45.209
Yo, cracker,
you gonna pay for this shit!

33:48.964 --> 33:52.134
Where the fuck you going?
Where the fuck you going?

33:53.886 --> 33:55.930
What you gonna do, motherfucker?

33:56.055 --> 34:00.143
Hey, hey, be cool. Be cool, all right?

34:00.268 --> 34:02.938
I'll find out what's going on in here.

34:11.447 --> 34:12.783
Richie.

34:18.288 --> 34:19.289
Open the door!

34:19.456 --> 34:21.083
Open the motherfucking door!

34:21.250 --> 34:22.418
Where's your backup?

34:22.543 --> 34:23.878
You motherfucking cracker!

34:24.003 --> 34:26.464
You got no backup? Why is that?

34:26.589 --> 34:28.801
You gotta come
out sometime, motherfucker!

34:29.969 --> 34:31.136
Bandage his neck.

34:31.262 --> 34:32.346
Richie, he's dead.

34:32.513 --> 34:33.973
I know he's fucking dead, right.

34:34.098 --> 34:35.808
Bandage his neck, clean up his head,

34:35.933 --> 34:38.311
prop him up on the gurney
so he's sitting and open his fucking eyes.

34:38.436 --> 34:39.437
Open this fucking door!

34:39.603 --> 34:40.855
All right? Let's go.

34:40.981 --> 34:42.399
Fuck.

34:45.485 --> 34:47.530
All right, clean him up.

34:47.989 --> 34:50.032
Okay. Where's the solution?

34:52.368 --> 34:53.536
Hey.
- Huh?

34:55.205 --> 34:57.332
God damn it, open this fucking door!

34:58.667 --> 34:59.751
- Give me your gun.
- What?

34:59.876 --> 35:01.129
Give me your gun.

35:01.296 --> 35:04.048
Get your punk ass out here, man!

35:04.173 --> 35:06.634
- You have your badge?
- Yeah.

35:06.759 --> 35:08.219
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!

35:08.344 --> 35:09.763
- You guys ready?
- Uh-huh.

35:09.888 --> 35:12.099
Okay. Just keep moving forward.

35:12.725 --> 35:14.518
- You all right?
- Yeah.

35:15.978 --> 35:17.731
It's okay! It's okay!

35:18.189 --> 35:19.816
We're taking him to the hospital.

35:19.983 --> 35:22.819
Everybody, step back! Step back!

35:23.987 --> 35:25.239
He's all right.

35:25.406 --> 35:27.366
He's okay. We're taking care of him.

35:27.491 --> 35:29.243
Step back. Step back.

35:31.078 --> 35:33.540
Everything's fine. Just stand back.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.334
He's all right.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.752
He's alive.

35:37.919 --> 35:39.004
What happened inside?

35:39.171 --> 35:40.881
We're taking him to the hospital.

35:50.225 --> 35:51.560
Thanks, man.

35:52.561 --> 35:53.896
Fuck.

35:54.438 --> 35:57.317
That asshole pulled a piece on me, man.
Can you fucking believe it?

35:57.442 --> 35:58.944
He pulls a piece on a cop?

35:59.069 --> 36:01.738
I had to do it, man. Kill or be killed.

36:02.447 --> 36:04.658
Fucking crazy world, right?

36:07.536 --> 36:09.163
What the fuck were you
doing in the projects?

36:09.288 --> 36:12.792
Investigating stuff, man, you know,

36:12.917 --> 36:16.171
just like you taught me. Checking on guys,

36:16.296 --> 36:19.716
following things up,
putting the pieces together.

36:19.883 --> 36:23.554
That guy was a dealer.
A fucking dealer. Scum of the earth.

36:24.597 --> 36:27.433
That guy didn't pull a gun on a cop, Jay.

36:27.558 --> 36:31.647
That guy pulled a gun on a junkie,
a junkie who was trying to rob him.

36:31.772 --> 36:33.649
What the fuck you say?

36:34.984 --> 36:36.860
What the fuck, man?
What are you doing, man?

36:36.986 --> 36:39.447
- What the fuck is that?
- That's my fucking money, man!

36:39.572 --> 36:41.199
I earned this shit. That's mine!

36:41.324 --> 36:42.951
- I earned it doing good cop work!
- What the fuck is this?

36:43.118 --> 36:44.744
- What the fuck is that?
- I earned it doing good cop work!

36:44.911 --> 36:46.497
- You murdered a guy!
- I earned it getting shot at!

36:46.622 --> 36:48.249
You murdered a guy!

36:49.000 --> 36:52.336
You murdered him, you robbed his money,
then you called me to get you out of it.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.339
That makes me an accessory
after the fact, motherfucker.

36:54.464 --> 36:58.385
I'll tell you the facts, man. Just write
the report the way I say it happened,

36:58.552 --> 37:02.598
and then that's the way it is,
and that's how it will be.

37:03.474 --> 37:05.101
I can't do that.

37:06.019 --> 37:09.856
I'm a leper because I listened to you
and turned in a million bucks.

37:10.024 --> 37:12.651
No one will work with me after that.

37:12.776 --> 37:16.905
I can get off this shit, Richie. That's easy.

37:17.406 --> 37:22.037
Just write the report between us,
as partners.

37:23.788 --> 37:25.332
I can't do that.

37:27.460 --> 37:28.461
Hey!

37:30.087 --> 37:32.131
Stop! Stop!

37:32.798 --> 37:33.966
Fuck it.

38:12.259 --> 38:13.719
Open the trunk.

38:28.361 --> 38:31.865
Peace now! Peace now! Peace now!

38:32.032 --> 38:35.119
LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?

38:36.036 --> 38:39.124
Get out, get out, get out of Vietnam!

38:39.291 --> 38:42.127
Get out, get out, get out of Vietnam!

38:42.294 --> 38:45.547
:: As loud as we can
that the Vietnam War should stop,

38:45.672 --> 38:48.843
and that the best way
to stop it is for the United States

38:49.010 --> 38:52.013
to simply pack up
and get out of Vietnam right now:

38:57.644 --> 38:59.104
How we looking?

39:02.149 --> 39:05.737
Typically, what I see is 25% to 45% pure.

39:05.903 --> 39:09.490
I mean, there's no adulterants,
no alkaloids, no dilutants.

39:09.866 --> 39:11.368
It's 100%.

39:16.498 --> 39:17.583
May I?

39:17.750 --> 39:19.294
Take it with you.

39:20.211 --> 39:21.212
Thank you, Frank.

41:18.135 --> 41:21.806
I'll take it.
No contingencies, no loans, no nothing.

41:23.308 --> 41:24.392
Cash.

41:25.435 --> 41:26.895
Fabulous.

41:31.525 --> 41:35.905
I'm not talking about your proclivities,
Richie. Those I only know too well.

41:36.072 --> 41:38.116
I'm talking about being a cop.

41:38.241 --> 41:40.702
You're talking about taking money?

41:40.869 --> 41:42.037
I don't do that. It's not my thing.

41:42.204 --> 41:43.664
What about your friends
from the neighbourhood?

41:43.789 --> 41:45.917
- Do you still hang out with them?
- Yeah.

41:46.084 --> 41:47.335
Play baseball on the weekends.

41:47.460 --> 41:49.837
Wise guys? That's gonna look good.

41:50.338 --> 41:52.716
Guys I went to high school with. So what?

41:52.841 --> 41:54.802
What about Joseph Sodano?

41:56.011 --> 41:57.096
What about him?

41:57.304 --> 41:59.973
Richie, I'm just trying
to understand things your wife has said.

42:00.099 --> 42:01.434
If they're not true, tell me.

42:01.559 --> 42:03.103
Yeah, he's one of them.

42:03.228 --> 42:05.689
- Is he also your son's godfather?
- Yeah.

42:05.814 --> 42:07.691
He's definitely fucking her.

42:07.857 --> 42:12.154
Do you really care about this?
Or do you just not want her to win ever?

42:16.242 --> 42:19.496
You know, there's an interview room
on the second floor.

42:19.663 --> 42:21.790
- That's what I thought.
- The door only locks from the inside.

42:21.957 --> 42:23.333
All rise.

42:29.757 --> 42:33.804
Oh, God, Richie.
Richie, fuck me like a cop, not a lawyer!

42:43.231 --> 42:44.858
Don't answer it!

42:50.781 --> 42:51.866
Yeah?

43:05.923 --> 43:07.884
- Richie Roberts.
- Hey, Norm?

43:10.720 --> 43:11.721
Hey. Richie Roberts.

43:11.846 --> 43:12.847
Hi. Detective Norman Reily.

43:13.014 --> 43:15.309
- Hey, Norm. How are you?
- Good.

43:15.476 --> 43:17.436
- So, is that him?
- Yeah.

43:25.653 --> 43:29.408
Picked a nice night to come out, huh?
It's like Grand Central around here.

43:29.533 --> 43:31.077
It's been like this.

43:31.243 --> 43:35.623
I'm lucky if I get home by midnight.
It's like nothing we've seen before.

43:40.462 --> 43:42.339
Something I gotta sign?

43:42.506 --> 43:44.383
Yeah. It's right here.

43:44.508 --> 43:46.886
I'm taking this with me.
I'll register it with Essex County, all right?

43:47.095 --> 43:48.471
All right.

43:50.765 --> 43:56.397
America's public enemy number one
in the United States is drug abuse:

43:57.815 --> 43:59.692
In order to fight and defeat this enemy,

43:59.858 --> 44:04.572
it is necessary to wage a new,
all-out offensive:

44:04.989 --> 44:07.659
Federal authorities
have announced their intention

44:07.826 --> 44:10.287
to establish special narcotics bureaus

44:10.413 --> 44:13.124
in Washington, New York,
Los Ángeles, Chicago:::

44:13.290 --> 44:15.960
A detective without
the support of his fellow detectives

44:16.085 --> 44:17.879
really can't do much.

44:19.673 --> 44:21.800
You know why I don't have it.

44:22.509 --> 44:25.470
Doesn't matter. You did what you had to do.

44:25.595 --> 44:29.600
Greatest city in the world!
And it's turning into an open sewer.

44:29.726 --> 44:32.979
Everybody's stealing, dealing.

44:34.398 --> 44:37.735
Look at you.
You can't work because you did your job.

44:37.901 --> 44:41.238
Good news is,
you're not the only honest cop in town.

44:41.405 --> 44:46.119
The special narcotics bureau
in Washington is not a dog and pony show.

44:46.244 --> 44:49.581
They are sincere. I know this
because they want us to orchestrate it.

44:49.748 --> 44:52.209
And I want you to
head up things here on our end.

44:52.376 --> 44:54.253
If it's federal,
who do I answer to, the post office?

44:54.378 --> 44:55.713
No, you answer to me,

44:55.838 --> 44:58.300
me and the US Attorney, nobody else.

44:59.760 --> 45:01.428
You never step foot
in a police station again.

45:04.306 --> 45:06.768
You work out of your own place,
you pick your own guys,

45:06.893 --> 45:09.354
guys that you know
would not take a nickel off the sidewalk.

45:32.922 --> 45:36.258
Well, we got the lovely transit.

45:38.302 --> 45:41.264
600-year-old mahogany doors.

45:43.934 --> 45:47.105
Now, look at that. Can't you just feel it?

45:47.814 --> 45:49.899
I think it's lovely.

45:50.024 --> 45:52.110
Watch your step.

45:56.323 --> 45:58.701
Look at these beautiful floors.

45:58.826 --> 46:02.831
At least, I don't know, 200 years old.
And it's hard to get the cracks...

46:02.956 --> 46:06.960
Now this was one of my favourite rooms but
we had some problems with the plumbing.

46:07.085 --> 46:09.963
I even fixed it. I know it works.
It's not gonna leak.

46:13.843 --> 46:16.137
Here it is.

46:22.853 --> 46:25.313
You know, I used to be a really good
piano player when I was a kid,

46:25.439 --> 46:28.234
but then, I don't know why I forgot.

46:29.027 --> 46:30.820
Life goes on. Well...

46:33.531 --> 46:36.285
How long are you gonna be?

46:38.203 --> 46:40.497
Oh, and do me a favour, please.
Mind the doors.

46:40.622 --> 46:44.294
Those are beautiful, ornate glass doors,
you know.

46:52.678 --> 46:53.679
Here we go, Jimmy. Come on.

46:53.846 --> 46:55.806
Oh, yeah. Give it back.

47:00.604 --> 47:01.605
Huey's.

47:01.772 --> 47:02.856
Huey: What up, boy?

47:03.023 --> 47:04.107
Yeah, who this?

47:04.274 --> 47:05.734
Who you think it is, boy?

47:05.859 --> 47:07.570
- Frank:
- Frank who?

47:07.945 --> 47:10.573
- Frank your brother, negro:
- Frank?

47:13.368 --> 47:14.369
That's right.

47:14.535 --> 47:16.538
Hey, Melvin! Melvin, where's Ma?

47:16.663 --> 47:19.208
- What?
- Frank's on the phone!

47:19.375 --> 47:20.834
Hey, Ma!
- How are you doing, Frankie?

47:20.959 --> 47:22.920
Frank's on the phone!

47:23.380 --> 47:25.423
- Say what?
- Mama, Frank's on the phone!

47:25.548 --> 47:27.258
Frank? Oh, my Lord!

47:27.384 --> 47:29.552
Yeah, when?
Well, you just say it, man, yeah.

47:29.677 --> 47:31.012
Listen, I'm gonna call y'all back

47:31.137 --> 47:33.391
at 6:00. I want you to get
everybody together, all right?

47:33.516 --> 47:34.517
Get Mama, get everybody.

47:34.642 --> 47:36.352
- All right?
- Okay.

47:52.328 --> 47:53.579
Hey, Frank!

47:53.705 --> 47:54.956
What's happening, Frank?

47:55.081 --> 47:57.626
- Hey, Frankie.
- How you doing, Uncle Frank?

47:57.751 --> 48:00.629
Get out the car.
Get the kids, get the kids.

48:01.547 --> 48:03.090
Look at this, baby.

48:03.215 --> 48:07.137
Oh, my Lord!
I'm so glad to see you, boy.

48:07.512 --> 48:11.976
Oh, I'm telling you,
this is some piece of land you got here!

48:13.310 --> 48:14.687
I wonder what
the poor people are doing here?

48:14.812 --> 48:16.147
And whose house is that,
Frankie?

48:16.272 --> 48:18.441
That is your house, Mama.

48:19.025 --> 48:21.194
- Mine?
- That's yours.

48:22.070 --> 48:23.697
And who else?

48:25.073 --> 48:28.828
Now, there, that's my room
right there, man. Right over there.

48:35.460 --> 48:37.713
Anybody want some more collard greens?

48:39.465 --> 48:43.844
I wanna tell you how happy
I am to see all my children at the table

48:43.970 --> 48:46.431
and the grandchildren at the same time.

48:46.556 --> 48:48.308
My heart's so happy.

48:48.433 --> 48:49.893
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Right on, Grandma.

48:50.643 --> 48:52.980
I hope you got a job, boy,
the way you're eating over here.

48:53.105 --> 48:56.901
That boy right there, he got a arm on him.
I mean, a major league arm.

48:57.026 --> 48:58.027
Oh, yeah?

48:58.152 --> 48:59.570
Ain't that right?

48:59.695 --> 49:00.822
Right on, Pop.

49:00.947 --> 49:03.325
Well, we'll see after dinner.
We'll see him throw it around a little bit.

49:03.492 --> 49:05.243
No, no, you can't catch him, man.

49:05.369 --> 49:06.703
I'm talking about... I'm talking about...

49:06.828 --> 49:08.539
This guy throw harder than Gibson.

49:08.664 --> 49:10.875
We're talking 95 miles an hour.

49:11.292 --> 49:13.252
- Can you catch him?
- He gonna...

49:13.378 --> 49:14.879
He gonna catch the ground.

49:15.004 --> 49:17.716
We might've played catch,
I think, when I was about five years old.

49:17.841 --> 49:20.636
Since then, he ain't been able to keep up.

49:23.180 --> 49:25.642
- This is your room.
- It's perfect.

49:26.643 --> 49:28.561
Oh. Why, it's...

49:28.937 --> 49:30.939
Will you look at this?

49:31.106 --> 49:32.107
Oh!

49:33.359 --> 49:36.529
It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's just...

49:37.113 --> 49:38.114
I...

49:44.705 --> 49:46.206
How did you...

49:46.331 --> 49:47.749
I had it made.

49:49.544 --> 49:50.795
From memory.

49:51.003 --> 49:52.547
You were five when they took it away on me.

49:52.672 --> 49:54.424
- That's right.
- How could you remember it?

49:54.549 --> 49:56.134
How could I forget, Mama?

50:00.848 --> 50:04.351
I'll just tell you it is perfect.

50:04.936 --> 50:07.147
It's all perfect.

50:12.193 --> 50:14.822
I can't tell you how much I love you.

50:14.947 --> 50:16.657
I love you, too, Mama.

50:17.450 --> 50:18.576
It's okay.

50:27.377 --> 50:31.174
Both these guys,
good with wires, they got solid informants,

50:31.299 --> 50:34.177
and they're honest and they're fearless.

50:34.302 --> 50:36.846
They're insane, Richie, like you.

50:37.389 --> 50:38.849
Where are they?

50:41.060 --> 50:44.605
That's Jones with the skinny white broad.

50:44.730 --> 50:46.357
Best I ever seen on the street.

50:46.483 --> 50:50.028
He knows dope, but he's together, all right?

50:50.153 --> 50:52.530
He's a stand-up guy all round.

50:52.655 --> 50:56.118
And that's Abruzzo
with the two fat black ones.

50:57.161 --> 50:59.705
He loves a big ass, man.

51:00.081 --> 51:04.378
He's a bulldog. He don't fuck around,
all right. He's got a bit of a temper,

51:04.544 --> 51:08.131
yeah, but you can trust
this guy with your grandmother.

51:08.256 --> 51:12.595
Listen, Richie. We work together.
You want me, you gotta take them, too.

51:24.983 --> 51:25.985
When do we start?

51:29.322 --> 51:30.490
The man I worked for,

51:30.657 --> 51:32.283
he had one of the biggest companies
in New York City.

51:32.409 --> 51:34.745
He ran it for more than 50 years.

51:35.329 --> 51:39.083
Fifteen years, eight months and nine days,

51:39.208 --> 51:40.751
I was with him every day. I worked for him,

51:40.918 --> 51:44.589
I protected him,
I looked after him, I learnt from him.

51:45.132 --> 51:47.759
Bumpy was rich,
but he wasn't white man rich, you see?

51:47.884 --> 51:49.344
He wasn't wealthy.

51:49.469 --> 51:51.806
He didn't own his own company.
He thought he did, but he didn't,

51:51.931 --> 51:53.516
he just managed it.

51:53.641 --> 51:56.018
The white man owned it, so they owned him.

51:56.144 --> 51:57.520
- Nobody owns me, though.
- Hey.

51:57.646 --> 51:59.565
- How you doing, babe?
- Good.

51:59.690 --> 52:02.317
That's 'cause I own my own company,
and my company sells a product

52:02.443 --> 52:05.070
that's better than the competition,

52:05.655 --> 52:08.658
at a price that's lower than the competition.

52:09.451 --> 52:11.244
Well, what are we selling here, Frank?

52:26.678 --> 52:28.722
How you doing, Red?

52:28.847 --> 52:30.600
These are my brothers,
just got here from North Carolina.

52:30.725 --> 52:31.726
Everybody, this is Redtop.

52:31.893 --> 52:33.269
- Hello.
- How you doing?

52:33.394 --> 52:35.813
And the ladies.
Hey.

52:35.938 --> 52:39.109
What wrong? Y'all niggas
ain't never seen hoochie before?

52:39.359 --> 52:40.527
Why are they all naked?

52:40.652 --> 52:42.362
So they can't steal nothing.

52:42.905 --> 52:43.906
Right.

52:44.907 --> 52:49.621
The most important thing in business
is honesty, integrity, hard work,

52:50.705 --> 52:51.956
family,

52:52.874 --> 52:54.960
never forgetting where we came from.

52:55.211 --> 52:56.921
Thank you, Charlene.

53:01.842 --> 53:06.848
See, you are what you are in this world,
that's either one of two things.

53:08.558 --> 53:10.645
Either you're somebody,

53:11.521 --> 53:13.856
or you're nobody. Be right back.

53:29.916 --> 53:32.210
I need these fresh. 'Cause
if I have to come back here and get you,

53:32.377 --> 53:33.378
- you know what it is.
Tango.

53:33.503 --> 53:35.005
- Don't y'all play that.
Yes, sir, I hear you.

53:35.131 --> 53:37.049
You won't have to come back.
There won't be no problem.

53:37.174 --> 53:38.759
What about you, Frank?
You need anything?

53:38.884 --> 53:40.970
Where's my money?
Redtop gave you the package.

53:41.095 --> 53:42.639
You're supposed to be
handing me my money.

53:42.764 --> 53:44.474
Here's a jar right here. Twenty percent.

53:44.599 --> 53:46.852
- You got the jar?
- That's right.

53:48.145 --> 53:49.604
Get the fuck out of here...
What you gonna do?

53:50.982 --> 53:53.443
What the fuck you gonna do, Frank?
Huh? What you doing?

53:53.609 --> 53:57.905
You gonna shoot me in front of everybody?
Huh? Come on.

54:00.325 --> 54:01.577
Shit.

54:13.465 --> 54:16.260
There you go. Twenty percent.

54:40.037 --> 54:41.872
So, what was I saying?

54:51.174 --> 54:52.217
Jones.

54:54.010 --> 54:55.721
Jonesy.

54:57.681 --> 54:59.141
That was nice, man.

55:00.559 --> 55:03.814
- Just doing my melodious thing, baby.
- Got you.

55:10.278 --> 55:13.699
This is the newly formed
Essex County Narcotics Squad.

55:14.992 --> 55:18.579
Our mandate is to make major arrests.
No street guys.

55:19.665 --> 55:22.751
We're looking for
the suppliers and the distributors.

55:22.876 --> 55:26.004
Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines.
No grass under 1,000 pounds.

55:26.130 --> 55:27.841
No powder under 40 kilograms.

55:27.966 --> 55:29.884
Any less than that,
then somebody else can waste their time.

55:30.009 --> 55:33.721
We gonna be handling the big shipments,
the big money and the big temptation.

55:33.847 --> 55:35.056
I heard a story about you.

55:35.181 --> 55:37.935
That you found a million dollars
in unmarked cash

55:38.060 --> 55:40.813
and gave that shit back. Is that true?

55:41.522 --> 55:44.484
Yeah, I did.
Anybody got a problem with that?

55:48.655 --> 55:50.740
So do I, you know?
I think about it every day.

55:50.866 --> 55:53.786
I should be down in South Florida
with a 68-foot cruiser doing fishing charters.

55:53.911 --> 55:54.996
You and me, both.

55:55.121 --> 55:58.291
But you know, I didn't, so here I am,

55:58.416 --> 56:00.836
and we'll be looking to land
other kind of sharks.

56:28.408 --> 56:30.160
- All right?
Bingo.

56:53.686 --> 56:55.814
See that, Richie?
- Yeah.

56:55.939 --> 56:58.859
And this stuff is your everyday stuff.

56:58.984 --> 57:01.821
But this Blue Magic, twice the potency.

57:01.946 --> 57:06.576
I mean, it's the purest thing I ever seen
in the streets. It's strong enough to smoke.

57:06.701 --> 57:09.704
And that's for those white suburban kids
who are scared of needles.

57:09.830 --> 57:11.623
I paid 10 bucks for that.

57:11.748 --> 57:14.377
And it's everywhere.
I mean, it's on every corner out there.

57:14.502 --> 57:16.254
So, how is that possible?

57:16.379 --> 57:20.007
Who can afford to sell
shit twice as good for half as much?

57:27.933 --> 57:30.270
Hey, man. Frankie, baby, good to see you!

57:30.395 --> 57:31.396
Everything's good?

57:31.521 --> 57:32.605
Yeah, man, just got back from Europe,

57:32.730 --> 57:35.233
over there for two months,
south of France, man.

57:37.987 --> 57:40.948
Look right, look right.
Wonderful, wonderful.

57:43.868 --> 57:45.328
Nicky!

57:46.830 --> 57:48.039
Give us a smile, Nicky.

57:48.165 --> 57:49.374
Show us the cover.

57:49.499 --> 57:50.625
You know what I'm saying, man?

57:50.750 --> 57:52.043
Hey, Nicky, over here.

57:52.169 --> 57:53.588
There you go.

57:55.840 --> 57:57.175
Nicky!

57:58.676 --> 58:01.472
Who is that? Look at you, my man.

58:10.190 --> 58:11.232
All right.

58:11.357 --> 58:12.859
Ladies and gentlemen,

58:12.984 --> 58:15.653
the Brown Bomber! The champ!

58:15.779 --> 58:17.364
Mr Joe Louis!

58:26.500 --> 58:28.293
Who's that with Joe?

58:28.418 --> 58:30.295
Miss Puerto Rico.

58:30.420 --> 58:33.299
- Puerto Rico? Is she a beauty queen?
- Mmm-hmm.

58:33.424 --> 58:35.510
For real. The beauty queen.

58:59.787 --> 59:02.581
- Welcome.
- My main man. My main man.

59:08.046 --> 59:09.422
Can you all excuse us for a minute, please?

59:09.548 --> 59:10.590
Yeah, sure, Frank.

59:10.715 --> 59:12.384
Yes, sir.

59:13.469 --> 59:14.887
Thank you.

59:18.724 --> 59:20.101
What's going on, man?

59:20.226 --> 59:21.895
- What you smiling about?
- I don't know.

59:22.020 --> 59:24.648
- What is this? Huh?
- What's what?

59:24.773 --> 59:26.859
- What's what?
- Come here.

59:28.444 --> 59:29.737
What is that you got on?

59:29.863 --> 59:31.406
What's what, man?

59:31.531 --> 59:33.450
Yeah, that! What you got on.

59:33.575 --> 59:34.826
This is a very, very, very nice suit.

59:34.951 --> 59:36.744
That's a very, very, very nice suit, huh?

59:36.870 --> 59:38.831
- That's a clown suit. That's a costume...
- Come on, man.

59:38.956 --> 59:41.167
...with a big sign on it that says "Arrest Me."

59:41.292 --> 59:44.420
You understand? You're too loud.
You're making too much noise. Look at me.

59:44.545 --> 59:49.050
The loudest one in the room is
the weakest one in the room. I told you that.

59:49.176 --> 59:51.720
All right? What,
are you trying to be like Nicky Barnes, now?

59:51.845 --> 59:53.305
What's your problem with Nicky, man?
I like Nicky.

59:53.430 --> 59:54.974
I ain't got no problem with Nicky.
Oh, you like Nicky?

59:55.099 --> 59:56.392
- Yeah!
- You want to be like Nicky?

59:56.517 --> 59:59.145
You want to be superfly?
You wanna work for him?

59:59.270 --> 01:00:01.063
Share a jail cell with him?
Maybe cook for him?

01:00:01.189 --> 01:00:02.232
He wants to talk to you.

01:00:02.357 --> 01:00:05.194
- Oh, so now you talking to him about me?
- What? You...

01:00:05.319 --> 01:00:06.779
- About what? What is it about?
- It ain't like that.

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.238
- Then what is it like?
- We were talking,

01:00:08.363 --> 01:00:10.241
- your name came up.
- About what?

01:00:10.366 --> 01:00:13.244
I don't know, man. I told him I'd tell you.

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:16.581
You know... Boy, you...

01:00:18.417 --> 01:00:21.086
You know, if you wasn't my brother,
I'd kill you. You know that, don't you?

01:00:21.212 --> 01:00:22.963
I'd blow your motherfucking brains out.

01:00:23.088 --> 01:00:24.089
Come on, man. Don't be like that.

01:00:24.215 --> 01:00:25.466
I'm taking you shopping this week.

01:00:25.591 --> 01:00:27.427
- I went shopping.
- I can tell.

01:00:27.552 --> 01:00:30.222
See deep into you

01:00:30.806 --> 01:00:35.228
And know what you're thinking now

01:00:36.479 --> 01:00:39.524
And if I'm what you're needing

01:00:40.316 --> 01:00:44.446
I need some kind of sign

01:00:44.947 --> 01:00:48.867
Let me know, 'cause I can't read your mind

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:55.333
Are you in or am I in this on my own?

01:00:55.458 --> 01:00:57.585
I need some clue from you

01:00:58.379 --> 01:01:00.047
It's a tax thing.

01:01:00.381 --> 01:01:02.091
It's a mistake my lawyers
are straightening out,

01:01:02.216 --> 01:01:05.511
- but for the time being...
- How much do you owe, Joe?

01:01:06.805 --> 01:01:09.432
It's nothing. It's like...

01:01:09.641 --> 01:01:10.767
Fifty grand.

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:14.271
You got it.

01:01:15.314 --> 01:01:18.151
Thank you, man.
Hey, I'm gonna pay you back as soon as I...

01:01:18.276 --> 01:01:21.654
Joe, this ain't no loan. It's a gift. All right?

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:24.324
All you did for Bumpy, we owe you.

01:01:24.908 --> 01:01:26.994
Keep your chin up. All right? Okay?

01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:30.122
All you have which is down there. Down.
Chin down.

01:01:30.665 --> 01:01:32.750
All right. Doc, will see you, okay?

01:01:35.253 --> 01:01:36.671
You play it so cool

01:01:36.796 --> 01:01:37.922
Hey!

01:01:39.467 --> 01:01:40.342
You still owe me that dance, right?

01:01:40.468 --> 01:01:42.219
Doc, come on.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.642
Frank, check this.

01:01:56.068 --> 01:01:57.695
- How you doing?
- Hi.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:59.864
- Frank Lucas.
- Eva Kendo.

01:02:00.698 --> 01:02:01.824
Nice to meet you, Eva.

01:02:01.949 --> 01:02:03.827
Nice to meet you, Frank.

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:06.872
You're Frank and this is your place?

01:02:06.997 --> 01:02:10.000
That's right. I'm Frank and this is my place.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.631
Why is it called Small's?
Why don't you call it Frank's?

01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:19.637
When you own something,
you can call it what you want.

01:02:19.762 --> 01:02:21.013
Small's.

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:23.933
Or Frank's. Frankie Small's.

01:02:24.517 --> 01:02:26.060
Small's Frankie.

01:02:27.562 --> 01:02:29.022
That's right.

01:02:29.523 --> 01:02:31.566
You want to let my hand go?

01:02:33.068 --> 01:02:34.236
Okay.

01:02:35.655 --> 01:02:36.697
You leaving?

01:02:36.823 --> 01:02:38.199
No, I was going to my table.

01:02:38.324 --> 01:02:40.785
Okay. Need somebody to go with you?

01:02:42.954 --> 01:02:44.122
- Yes?
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:47.709 --> 01:02:48.710
All the cheesies.

01:02:48.836 --> 01:02:50.546
Right here, here we go.
What have we got here?

01:02:50.671 --> 01:02:53.216
Wash your hands?
I got one print of that, don't smudge it.

01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:54.801
Yeah.

01:02:57.011 --> 01:02:58.263
Hey, Spearman, what about him?
- Who is that?

01:02:58.429 --> 01:03:00.516
Joey Sodano. Don Cattano's nephew.

01:03:00.641 --> 01:03:02.143
Yeah, yeah.
Put him up there by the big man.

01:03:02.268 --> 01:03:03.644
He looks like your uncle, Abruzzo.

01:03:03.769 --> 01:03:04.854
Yeah, but he's not as handsome.

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.231
He looks more like your sister.
Where's Ice Pick's mug?

01:03:07.357 --> 01:03:08.358
Yeah, that's funny.

01:03:08.483 --> 01:03:09.651
Maybe you guys
should take that show on the road.

01:03:09.776 --> 01:03:12.154
So we need Ice Pick Paul.

01:03:12.279 --> 01:03:13.613
Ice Pick Paul?
Sure. Yeah.

01:03:13.738 --> 01:03:15.240
There you go. Get him up.

01:03:15.365 --> 01:03:17.910
Ice Pick Paul,
he goes way up there, up top.

01:03:18.035 --> 01:03:21.414
No, Ice Pick Paul, he's a fucking soldier.
This guy's a lieutenant.

01:03:21.539 --> 01:03:22.707
How's that even fucking possible?

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.835
That's Benny the Bishop.

01:03:25.752 --> 01:03:28.922
That guy is a soldier. This guy's
a lieutenant. No way that guy's on top.

01:03:29.047 --> 01:03:30.799
You thinking of Benny the Bishop.

01:03:30.924 --> 01:03:33.803
Vinnie Two Socks is fucking
Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.

01:03:33.928 --> 01:03:35.013
Jonesy's right.

01:03:35.138 --> 01:03:36.931
Hey, which one of you guys has ever
actually seen Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

01:03:37.015 --> 01:03:38.391
Actually seen it go down?

01:03:41.729 --> 01:03:44.315
Yeah, seen it go down.
Been in his place. Seen him handle drugs.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.317
That rat, Ricky, has told us...

01:03:46.442 --> 01:03:49.738
He's fucking dead. About four weeks ago.

01:03:50.906 --> 01:03:52.032
He's dead.

01:03:52.157 --> 01:03:54.409
All right, well,
we can take him off the fucking board.

01:03:54.534 --> 01:03:58.956
I don't think we got any
solid evidence on anybody on that board.

01:03:59.582 --> 01:04:02.502
What you saying, Richie?
This is weeks and weeks of work, man.

01:04:02.627 --> 01:04:06.089
I'm saying, take it down.
We got to start again from the street.

01:07:20.558 --> 01:07:22.101
Hi, who's this?

01:07:22.226 --> 01:07:25.438
- Hello? Gabe? Yeah, it's Scott:
- Yeah:

01:07:25.731 --> 01:07:28.150
Scotty! What's going down, brother?

01:07:28.275 --> 01:07:31.153
Those snow tyres you gave me last night:
They come in yet?

01:07:31.278 --> 01:07:34.991
- Oh, the snow tyres?
- Yeah: I want some more of them:

01:07:35.325 --> 01:07:37.577
- Give me one-and-a-half more:
- One-and-a-half,

01:07:37.702 --> 01:07:41.080
- that's a pretty big order.
- Yeah, I want the big whitewalls,

01:07:41.206 --> 01:07:43.542
they better get at least 100,000 miles:

01:07:43.667 --> 01:07:47.671
All right, I'll tell you what.
You come in here tomorrow morning

01:07:47.838 --> 01:07:51.092
I'm gonna set you up real nice
with a whitewall special, all right?

01:07:51.218 --> 01:07:53.178
- Thanks, bro:
- No problem:

01:07:55.347 --> 01:07:57.390
That's considerably more than
one year's salary, Richie.

01:08:00.269 --> 01:08:04.190
If it disappears,
I will not be able to get it for you again.

01:08:05.775 --> 01:08:06.902
That's yours.

01:08:07.027 --> 01:08:11.323
Signing my life away again,
for a lousy twenty grand.

01:08:14.702 --> 01:08:18.247
- It has to be Blue Magic, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gonna be Blue.

01:08:18.372 --> 01:08:19.415
You can pick it up here tomorrow.

01:08:19.541 --> 01:08:20.542
$20,000.

01:08:20.667 --> 01:08:22.377
Just leave it there.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.437
- How'd you do?
- Good.

01:08:40.481 --> 01:08:41.899
Here he comes.

01:08:42.024 --> 01:08:43.442
- That's him?
- Yep.

01:08:44.777 --> 01:08:46.363
That was quick.

01:08:57.834 --> 01:08:59.460
Richie, if he goes in the city,
what do we fucking do?

01:08:59.586 --> 01:09:01.129
Stay with the fucking money,
that's what we do.

01:09:01.254 --> 01:09:02.296
We stay with the money, all right?

01:09:02.423 --> 01:09:03.674
We can't go in the fucking city.

01:09:03.799 --> 01:09:05.593
Yes, we can.
That's 20 grand in there, all right,

01:09:05.718 --> 01:09:07.636
that I'm responsible for. I ain't losing it.

01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:09.345
It's out of our jurisdiction!

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:11.892
Follow the money!
All right, all right, all right!

01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:28.160
He's pulling over.

01:09:28.327 --> 01:09:30.328
All right, here we go.

01:09:30.495 --> 01:09:31.787
Let me out here.

01:09:34.332 --> 01:09:35.792
Don't disappear, all right?

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.879
I'll circle the block.

01:09:38.421 --> 01:09:39.380
Move!

01:09:57.067 --> 01:10:00.321
Hey! Who's the fuck?
You gotta fucking move!

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.003
Police Officer. I'm commandeering
your vehicle. Get out of the car.

01:10:15.755 --> 01:10:17.674
Who the fuck cares about you?
This is New York City, man.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.968
- Get someone else's car!
- Get out of the car.

01:10:20.134 --> 01:10:22.387
Come on, man. Can't we live in peace...

01:12:30.281 --> 01:12:32.116
Frankie, Frankie! Sit down.

01:12:32.325 --> 01:12:33.618
What?

01:12:34.452 --> 01:12:37.080
Happy birthday, gentlemen.
How you doing, huh?

01:12:37.247 --> 01:12:40.751
He's about to do something, huh?
He's going bowling?

01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:43.129
Look at that. Strike.

01:12:43.296 --> 01:12:44.463
Hey, what's between your legs?
What's in the bag?

01:12:44.672 --> 01:12:46.257
Nothing.
- Get up, you fucker. Get the fuck up!

01:12:46.424 --> 01:12:47.425
Knock it off.

01:12:47.592 --> 01:12:48.886
Shut the fuck up! What did I tell you?

01:12:49.052 --> 01:12:50.095
Keep your fucking head down.

01:12:50.262 --> 01:12:51.263
Shut up! Whose bag is this?

01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:52.389
What're you doing?
Sit down and shut up!

01:12:52.514 --> 01:12:53.682
Don't you move!

01:13:06.363 --> 01:13:08.782
Hey, guys? Guys! Officers!

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.203
Hey, I'm Richie Roberts, from Newark.

01:13:14.372 --> 01:13:15.999
That's my money.

01:13:16.666 --> 01:13:19.461
What the fuck?
What money, huh? What money?

01:13:20.838 --> 01:13:22.465
The bills are sequenced, right?

01:13:22.632 --> 01:13:25.718
They're registered with the Essex County
Prosecutor's Office. Just check them out.

01:13:25.885 --> 01:13:28.805
They all start with CF3500. Have a look.

01:13:34.228 --> 01:13:35.437
Fucking registers.

01:13:35.562 --> 01:13:38.816
I thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft
sitting in my driveway.

01:13:38.983 --> 01:13:41.861
Honest mistake. I'll just get the money.

01:13:43.404 --> 01:13:45.449
- This time.
- All right.

01:13:46.158 --> 01:13:48.369
- There it is.
All right. Thank you.

01:13:48.494 --> 01:13:51.789
When was the last time I was in Jersey?
Let me think.

01:13:53.416 --> 01:13:54.584
Never.

01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:58.672
What're you doing,
coming over here unannounced?

01:13:58.838 --> 01:14:01.759
You don't think you could
get hurt doing that?

01:14:02.927 --> 01:14:05.555
You got your fucking money, Richie.

01:14:06.597 --> 01:14:10.519
And never, ever come into
this city again unannounced.

01:14:10.686 --> 01:14:13.021
You come in to see
a fucking Broadway show,

01:14:13.188 --> 01:14:16.233
you call ahead first, see if it's okay with me.

01:14:17.610 --> 01:14:19.529
No problem. All right.

01:14:23.283 --> 01:14:25.536
Let's go, hit some balls.
Great suits, pal.

01:14:28.539 --> 01:14:30.082
Is that your car?

01:14:30.624 --> 01:14:32.334
That's a fucking great car.

01:14:33.795 --> 01:14:35.130
Have a nice fucking trip back to Jersey.

01:14:35.255 --> 01:14:36.381
All right.

01:14:36.506 --> 01:14:39.009
Come on, I got a tee time. Let's go.

01:14:43.055 --> 01:14:44.724
What were you doin' there?

01:14:44.891 --> 01:14:48.352
Well, that's where this dope is coming from.
Blue Magic, it's coming out of New York.

01:14:48.477 --> 01:14:50.063
What do you expect me to do, ignore it?

01:14:50.188 --> 01:14:53.442
The cab driver has filed aggravated assault
and grand theft charges

01:14:53.567 --> 01:14:54.902
which he may reconsider

01:14:55.027 --> 01:14:58.531
depending on how much
the State of New Jersey offers to settle.

01:14:59.282 --> 01:15:02.076
I showed him my ID. I told him I was a cop.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:06.832
You stole his cab
and you knock him out.

01:15:06.957 --> 01:15:08.959
I was chasing the twenty grand, all right?

01:15:09.084 --> 01:15:12.213
Next time, knock him out
before you show him your badge.

01:15:13.965 --> 01:15:17.719
Look, I don't want to hear
about you going into New York again.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.556
- Well, then this investigation's over.
- You're not listening to me.

01:15:21.681 --> 01:15:23.935
I said, "I don't want to hear
about you going into New York again."

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.729
You do whatever you have to do.
You go wherever you have to go

01:15:26.854 --> 01:15:29.398
to figure out
who's bringing this shit into the country.

01:15:29.523 --> 01:15:30.524
Just don't tell me about it.

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:31.526
Just don't tell me about it.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:38.284
There's your girl, right there.

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:44.457
- Hey, how'd you do?
- Hi.

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:46.627
- I didn't keep you waiting long, did I?
- No. Fine.

01:15:46.752 --> 01:15:49.880
Good. A woman as beautiful as you
shouldn't have to wait.

01:15:50.965 --> 01:15:52.758
For anything.

01:15:57.973 --> 01:16:00.767
Thank you, ma'am. You as pretty as ever.

01:16:05.439 --> 01:16:07.525
- Hey, Doc.
- Tommy!

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:09.902
Heard your boy scored
two touchdowns last week.

01:16:10.027 --> 01:16:12.864
- Sure. Sure do make father proud.
- All right.

01:16:24.127 --> 01:16:25.878
This is your father?

01:16:26.755 --> 01:16:28.716
That's Martin Luther King.

01:16:29.592 --> 01:16:31.468
- It is not.
- It is. It is Martin Luther King.

01:16:31.594 --> 01:16:33.053
You know, "I have a dream"?

01:16:33.178 --> 01:16:34.389
Of course.

01:16:34.514 --> 01:16:36.308
No, that's...

01:16:36.433 --> 01:16:39.978
He was just as important
as Martin Luther King to me.

01:16:40.103 --> 01:16:41.897
What did he do?

01:16:42.022 --> 01:16:47.528
Did a lot of things. He was a friend
and served New York. New York served him.

01:16:49.155 --> 01:16:50.741
He was my boss.

01:16:51.033 --> 01:16:52.326
My teacher.

01:16:52.451 --> 01:16:53.911
What did he teach you?

01:16:54.036 --> 01:16:56.330
He taught me a lot of things. He

01:16:58.541 --> 01:17:00.752
taught me how to take my time.

01:17:02.128 --> 01:17:06.759
Taught me that if I was going to
do something, to do it with care, with love.

01:17:07.009 --> 01:17:08.594
Anything else?

01:17:13.015 --> 01:17:15.185
He taught me to be a gentleman.

01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:16.394
That's what you are?

01:17:16.519 --> 01:17:18.647
That's what I try to be. Come here.

01:17:20.065 --> 01:17:22.108
Come here. Sit right here.

01:17:24.362 --> 01:17:25.696
Look at me.

01:17:26.614 --> 01:17:29.659
I own about five apartments in Manhattan.

01:17:31.119 --> 01:17:32.287
Homes all over the East Coast,

01:17:32.412 --> 01:17:35.123
I could have taken you to any one of them,
but I didn't.

01:17:35.249 --> 01:17:36.291
I brought you here.

01:17:36.416 --> 01:17:37.793
Frank, I was looking for you, boy.

01:17:37.918 --> 01:17:39.963
Because I wanted you to meet my mother.

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:41.631
How you doing, Ma?

01:17:41.756 --> 01:17:42.840
Is this her?

01:17:42.966 --> 01:17:44.509
- Eva, this is my mother.
Hi, Eva.

01:17:44.634 --> 01:17:45.802
Oh!

01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:47.263
Nice to meet you.

01:17:47.388 --> 01:17:48.973
- She's beautiful!
Yeah?

01:17:49.098 --> 01:17:54.061
Look at her, Frank.
She's an ángel come down from heaven.

01:17:54.186 --> 01:17:55.605
Thank you.

01:18:03.531 --> 01:18:06.325
Mr Roberts? I'm here for our appointment.

01:18:11.122 --> 01:18:12.791
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:18:15.210 --> 01:18:17.087
Sorry. Our appointment?

01:18:17.212 --> 01:18:19.047
Child Social Services.

01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:36.401
She did mention your name, though.

01:18:36.526 --> 01:18:37.694
The stewardess?

01:18:37.819 --> 01:18:39.654
No, not the stewardess.

01:18:40.363 --> 01:18:43.951
The lady from Child Services.
She mentioned your name.

01:18:44.118 --> 01:18:48.080
Right after she asked me
if I associated with any criminals.

01:18:48.205 --> 01:18:49.206
All right, go! Go, go!

01:18:49.332 --> 01:18:50.416
Yeah! You wanna see this?
- Go, go.

01:18:50.541 --> 01:18:52.085
Hey, boys.

01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:54.046
Joey. Hey, Joey!

01:18:54.171 --> 01:18:56.006
Get in the pool. Go on.

01:18:57.049 --> 01:18:58.759
Come on. Come on.

01:19:03.056 --> 01:19:05.058
So, how'd she get my name?

01:19:05.183 --> 01:19:06.601
- Laurie.
- Hmm.

01:19:07.645 --> 01:19:09.980
She's been saying a lot lately.

01:19:10.814 --> 01:19:12.024
A lot.

01:19:15.862 --> 01:19:18.448
You know, when you asked me
to be your son's godfather,

01:19:18.573 --> 01:19:19.741
I took it very seriously.

01:19:19.866 --> 01:19:21.701
I know. I know and I appreciate that.

01:19:21.826 --> 01:19:24.789
And I said yes,
I would take on this responsibility.

01:19:24.914 --> 01:19:27.458
Take care of your son,
if God forbid, something happened to you.

01:19:27.583 --> 01:19:30.461
Joe, the kind of things
she's saying to Child Social Services

01:19:30.586 --> 01:19:33.215
made me look really bad, all right.
You know,

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:37.636
out at all kinds of hours at night time,
lowlife informants around, women.

01:19:37.761 --> 01:19:39.596
Old friends like me.

01:19:40.515 --> 01:19:42.642
Old friends like you, yeah.

01:19:44.102 --> 01:19:46.312
Uncle Joey, watch me, okay?

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:51.485
Okay, I understand.

01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:55.656
They ask me, I'll tell them what you want me
to tell them. I'll lie for you.

01:19:55.781 --> 01:19:57.909
No, don't lie. You don't have to lie.

01:19:58.034 --> 01:20:01.162
Just, omit certain details.

01:20:01.913 --> 01:20:03.582
Sure. All right.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.004
You know, there's something else
I was gonna ask you.

01:20:08.129 --> 01:20:11.841
- Something else.
- You don't have to answer if you don't want.

01:20:13.427 --> 01:20:15.929
Blue Magic. Anything?

01:20:17.723 --> 01:20:22.270
Just a lot of sorrow, misery from guys
getting put out of work, that's all.

01:20:23.646 --> 01:20:24.856
What, your guys?

01:20:24.981 --> 01:20:26.232
Just guys.

01:20:27.734 --> 01:20:30.529
You thinking about where it's coming from?

01:20:30.654 --> 01:20:33.115
Guys down south. That's all I heard.

01:20:33.907 --> 01:20:35.576
- Cubans?
- I don't know.

01:20:36.745 --> 01:20:38.038
Not Mexico.

01:20:38.747 --> 01:20:39.873
I don't know.

01:20:40.081 --> 01:20:41.124
You're telling me,
it's coming in from South America?

01:20:41.207 --> 01:20:42.167
I don't know.

01:20:44.962 --> 01:20:49.884
All I can tell you is whoever it is,
they're upsetting the natural order of things.

01:20:50.009 --> 01:20:51.886
And that's all there is.

01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:08.112
What's up?

01:21:08.279 --> 01:21:10.074
My man, how we looking?

01:22:38.715 --> 01:22:41.176
Frank, I want you to meet Mike Sobota.

01:22:41.593 --> 01:22:42.927
- How are you doing, Mr Sobota?
- How are you?

01:22:43.053 --> 01:22:44.054
What can I get you?

01:22:44.179 --> 01:22:46.223
How about a left-hander?
From what Charlie tells me, your nephew.

01:22:46.349 --> 01:22:49.560
- Oh, this is the... Yankees, yeah. Hey, Steve!
- Yankees.

01:22:49.727 --> 01:22:51.145
- Steve! Come here.
- Excuse me one second.

01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:53.105
This boy's good, okay?
I want you to put him on the Yankees.

01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:54.274
'Cause you good enough, ain't you?

01:22:54.399 --> 01:22:56.526
I'm a Lucas.
Good enough on a bad day, Jack.

01:22:56.652 --> 01:22:58.362
He's good enough on a bad day,
so don't make it a bad day,

01:22:58.528 --> 01:22:59.905
make it a good day, you understand?

01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:04.369
NYPD, excuse me, Police Department.
Back up, baby.

01:23:04.494 --> 01:23:07.497
- Whoa!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:23:07.622 --> 01:23:09.374
- Taking your ass in, Jimmy.
- Uh-uh.

01:23:09.499 --> 01:23:11.669
- Taking your ass in.
- Where are the handcuffs?

01:23:11.794 --> 01:23:13.754
I got a licence for that, motherfucker.

01:23:13.921 --> 01:23:17.049
You got a licence for this?
Excuse me, all right?

01:23:19.135 --> 01:23:21.179
Shit. All right! Yeah!

01:23:21.429 --> 01:23:23.098
Now, you know what?
I gotta arrest you for that shit.

01:23:23.223 --> 01:23:24.391
That shit's too good to be on the street.

01:23:24.516 --> 01:23:28.271
Wait a minute, I got this for you.
You ain't got to arrest nobody.

01:23:28.396 --> 01:23:30.064
Are you bribing me now?

01:23:30.189 --> 01:23:32.733
I'll tell you what, I'm arresting everybody!

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:34.695
Now, all you're under arrest! You first!

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:36.363
That's my family. That's my...

01:23:36.488 --> 01:23:38.240
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:23:40.075 --> 01:23:41.743
Back it up, baby.

01:23:41.868 --> 01:23:42.912
What was that?

01:23:43.037 --> 01:23:44.706
- Come on, guys.
- What's the matter with you, man?

01:23:44.831 --> 01:23:46.374
- I said, what the hell was that?
- What was what?

01:23:46.499 --> 01:23:48.084
- I said what the hell are you doing, man?
- Be cool, man!

01:23:48.209 --> 01:23:49.377
What's your fucking problem?

01:23:49.502 --> 01:23:51.213
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:23:51.338 --> 01:23:53.090
Goddamn!

01:23:53.924 --> 01:23:56.427
He's all right.
I just shot him in the leg, is all.

01:23:56.552 --> 01:23:58.305
Damn, Jimmy!

01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.390
Get up.

01:24:14.113 --> 01:24:16.783
All right, everybody, get out! Get out!

01:24:17.993 --> 01:24:19.453
Come on, Frank, it was an accident.

01:24:19.578 --> 01:24:20.954
It wasn't no goddamn accident.
- He feels terrible.

01:24:21.079 --> 01:24:24.709
He don't feel shit, 'cause
he's coked up all the motherfucking time!

01:24:24.834 --> 01:24:26.961
He's your driver. Get rid of him.

01:24:27.086 --> 01:24:28.087
Come on, man, that's your cousin!

01:24:28.212 --> 01:24:30.256
That ain't shit to me!
He don't mean nothing to me.

01:24:30.381 --> 01:24:32.926
- What's he gonna do, go back home?
- I don't give a damn what he does!

01:24:33.052 --> 01:24:35.095
Send his ass home! Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:38.683
Hey! Don't rub on that! You blot that!
You understand? That's alpaca!

01:24:38.808 --> 01:24:42.270
That's $25,000 alpaca! You blot that shit!

01:24:42.395 --> 01:24:44.606
You don't rub it! Put the club soda on there.

01:24:44.731 --> 01:24:46.651
Simple Simon-ass motherfuckers.

01:24:46.776 --> 01:24:49.945
Listen, from now on, don't nobody
talk to me directly! You understand?

01:24:50.071 --> 01:24:53.699
You got business with me, you talk to Huey!
Huey, you talk to me! You got it?

01:24:53.824 --> 01:24:56.286
- All right.
- Damn it, never on the phone! You got it?

01:24:56.411 --> 01:24:57.621
- I got it.
- All right!

01:24:57.746 --> 01:25:00.123
And take them goddamn sunglasses off.

01:25:00.248 --> 01:25:01.792
Take the goddamn sunglasses off!

01:25:01.917 --> 01:25:03.461
Damn it, man.

01:25:05.713 --> 01:25:08.049
Simple Simon-ass motherfuckers.

01:25:23.566 --> 01:25:26.027
The whole place was imported.

01:25:26.486 --> 01:25:28.030
Brick by brick.

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.783
Gloucestershire.

01:25:31.534 --> 01:25:33.536
- Who?
- Great Britain.

01:25:34.287 --> 01:25:35.497
Yours.

01:25:40.627 --> 01:25:42.045
Here you go.

01:25:46.592 --> 01:25:47.593
Pull!

01:25:53.267 --> 01:25:54.893
Come, Eva.

01:25:55.769 --> 01:25:59.023
I'm sure you're dying
to see the rest of the house.

01:26:02.569 --> 01:26:05.071
Of course. Excuse me.

01:26:06.281 --> 01:26:09.452
Thank you for a wonderful lunch.
It was delicious.

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.375
What do you think of monopolies?

01:26:16.627 --> 01:26:17.753
You mean like the game?

01:26:17.919 --> 01:26:21.548
No, I just think monopolies
were made illegal in the country, Frank,

01:26:21.673 --> 01:26:23.885
'cause nobody wants to compete, you know.

01:26:24.010 --> 01:26:26.971
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

01:26:27.138 --> 01:26:29.724
I mean, you let the dairy farmers do that,

01:26:29.849 --> 01:26:31.810
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.

01:26:31.977 --> 01:26:33.437
Just trying to make a living.

01:26:33.562 --> 01:26:38.067
That's your right, I mean,
it's everyone's right. It's America.

01:26:38.442 --> 01:26:42.614
We just can't do it
at the unreasonable expense of others.

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:45.075
'Cause then it becomes un-American.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.160
That's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:49.038
could never represent
the true cost of production

01:26:49.163 --> 01:26:53.626
'cause it's got to be controlled.
It's gotta be set. It's gotta be fair.

01:26:53.751 --> 01:26:56.254
Gotta be controlled by who?
I set a price that I think is fair.

01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:57.631
- I don't think it's fair.
- You don't?

01:26:57.756 --> 01:26:59.216
- I don't think it's fair.
- I think it's fair.

01:26:59.341 --> 01:27:01.301
I mean, I know
your customers are happy, Frank,

01:27:01.426 --> 01:27:04.138
bunch of fucking junkies that they are.

01:27:04.263 --> 01:27:08.768
But we fellow dairy farmers out here, Frank,
are you thinking of us?

01:27:09.477 --> 01:27:11.229
You thinking of them?

01:27:11.354 --> 01:27:13.357
- The dairy farmers?
- Yeah.

01:27:13.482 --> 01:27:18.237
I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about
as much as they've ever thought about me.

01:27:18.362 --> 01:27:20.657
I'm just thinking out loud now.

01:27:21.199 --> 01:27:25.495
If you took some of your inventory, Frank,
and you sold it wholesale...

01:27:27.539 --> 01:27:28.541
Sit.

01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:32.795
We could work.
We could do some distribution.

01:27:34.213 --> 01:27:35.506
I don't know. I'm pretty good, Dominic.

01:27:35.631 --> 01:27:39.594
You know, I got 110th, 155th, river to river.
I'm all right.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:42.639
That's kind of a mom and pop store
next to what I'm talking about.

01:27:42.764 --> 01:27:44.350
I mean, let's go at least bigger than Kmart.

01:27:44.475 --> 01:27:49.355
I'm talking about LA, Chicago, Detroit,
Las Vegas. Let's go nationwide, huh?

01:27:49.814 --> 01:27:54.194
I'm gonna guarantee you your peace
of mind here. You don't want that?

01:27:55.612 --> 01:27:57.531
You're going to need it.

01:27:57.906 --> 01:27:59.533
I don't know how you view me, you know.

01:27:59.658 --> 01:28:01.494
I'm kind of a Renaissance man, Frank.

01:28:01.619 --> 01:28:03.580
You know,
the people I deal with on a daily basis,

01:28:03.705 --> 01:28:05.540
you know, they're not enlightened, Frank.

01:28:05.665 --> 01:28:08.419
You talk to them about civil rights,
they don't know, you know.

01:28:08.544 --> 01:28:10.129
They're not open to change.

01:28:10.254 --> 01:28:13.716
Not from the way things
are done and who's doing it.

01:28:13.966 --> 01:28:17.137
I talk to them,
there's just no misunderstandings.

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.683
And that's what I mean
by your peace of mind.

01:28:26.356 --> 01:28:29.359
You're paying, what, $75,000, $80,000 a kilo?

01:28:31.694 --> 01:28:33.822
I'm a Renaissance man, too.

01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:36.825
I'll consider $50,000.

01:28:45.585 --> 01:28:48.798
Why would you trust these people?
And the way they look at you...

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:51.258
They look at me like
it's Christmas and I'm Santa Claus.

01:28:51.384 --> 01:28:53.886
They look at us like we're the help.

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.555
They work for me now.

01:29:01.561 --> 01:29:01.777
I predict that
when I meet Joe Frazier,

01:29:01.812 --> 01:29:03.855
I predict that
when I meet Joe Frazier,

01:29:03.981 --> 01:29:08.277
this will be like a good amateur
fighting a real professional:

01:29:08.403 --> 01:29:10.905
This will be like a kid out of the Olympics:::

01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:13.367
That's gonna be Ali in like three.

01:29:13.492 --> 01:29:15.536
You're not fighting Oscar Bonavena,

01:29:15.661 --> 01:29:16.954
you're not fighting Sonny Liston:

01:29:17.079 --> 01:29:18.080
You're fighting Joe Frazier:

01:29:18.205 --> 01:29:19.832
ALl: Everybody knows that:
That's not the point:

01:29:19.957 --> 01:29:21.251
He's all talk, man.

01:29:21.376 --> 01:29:23.628
Look at Frazier!
Ali gonna crush him, baby.

01:29:23.753 --> 01:29:24.754
ALl: I'll stop him:

01:29:24.879 --> 01:29:26.131
Stop me? You?

01:29:26.256 --> 01:29:27.507
How soon? What round?

01:29:27.632 --> 01:29:31.137
Don't let him obligate you:
ALl: One to 10!

01:29:31.262 --> 01:29:36.100
Tonight, March 8, 1971:
Here we are at Madison Square Garden

01:29:36.225 --> 01:29:37.686
for the Fight of the Century:

01:29:37.811 --> 01:29:40.981
And by anybody's definition,
this is a happening:

01:29:41.106 --> 01:29:45.528
There are handshakes and,
of course, there are utterly beautiful women:

01:29:45.653 --> 01:29:47.780
But behind the smiles
and behind the handshakes,

01:29:47.905 --> 01:29:52.535
you can feel the atmosphere is so heavy
with tension, it's almost unbearable:

01:29:52.994 --> 01:29:55.289
Everybody who is anybody is here:

01:29:55.414 --> 01:29:59.209
Like Sinatra: Like Graziano,
David Frost and Diahann Carroll:

01:29:59.335 --> 01:30:03.131
And Woody Allen and Diane Keaton:
The celebrities are pouring in:

01:30:03.256 --> 01:30:07.344
ALl: The way you all build it up,
Life magazine cover, Time magazine,

01:30:07.469 --> 01:30:11.474
everybody gives their opinion:
Dempsey says I'll lose: Joe Louis:::

01:30:11.599 --> 01:30:14.977
And when Joe Louis said I'm gonna lose,
that's how I knew I'd won this one:

01:30:15.102 --> 01:30:18.065
Joe Louis always picks the wrong man!

01:30:18.190 --> 01:30:20.275
Always picks the wrong man:

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:23.320
Joe Louis is here tonight:
Watch your ass:

01:30:23.445 --> 01:30:26.824
The official weight of Joe Frazier
is 205:5 pounds:

01:30:27.659 --> 01:30:28.993
Oh.

01:30:30.578 --> 01:30:33.498
ALl: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee:

01:30:33.832 --> 01:30:36.001
You're not watching the fight, Bob?

01:30:36.126 --> 01:30:37.961
I'm not into boxing.

01:30:38.796 --> 01:30:41.090
This ain't boxing, kid.

01:30:41.215 --> 01:30:42.884
It's politics.

01:30:46.262 --> 01:30:47.889
I got something for you, too.

01:30:48.014 --> 01:30:49.474
Yeah?

01:30:52.103 --> 01:30:53.771
The coat? For me?

01:30:53.896 --> 01:30:54.980
Mmm-hmm.

01:30:55.564 --> 01:30:57.233
Do you like it?

01:30:57.358 --> 01:30:59.653
The coat? Yeah, yeah, it's nice.

01:31:02.656 --> 01:31:04.449
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

01:31:04.574 --> 01:31:06.327
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:31:13.919 --> 01:31:15.462
Over here, Sammy.

01:31:15.587 --> 01:31:17.965
Hey, Sammy! Give a look.

01:31:20.050 --> 01:31:21.468
Joe Louis! Over here!

01:31:21.593 --> 01:31:22.887
How's it going, Frank?

01:31:23.013 --> 01:31:24.556
How are you, Joe?

01:31:33.774 --> 01:31:38.572
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
we have quite a list of introductions:

01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:44.077
We are now going to introduce people
from all endeavours of life:

01:31:44.619 --> 01:31:46.748
And not just show people:

01:31:46.873 --> 01:31:49.876
Because everyone is here tonight!

01:32:01.972 --> 01:32:03.600
Main event!

01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:07.604
Fifteen rounds:

01:32:07.729 --> 01:32:12.777
For the undisputed
Heavyweight Championship of the World!

01:32:12.902 --> 01:32:13.944
There we go, Ali!

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:17.615
From Louisville, Kentucky,
he's wearing red trunks:

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.076
Champ! This is Frank Lucas.

01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:21.119
He weighs 215 pounds:

01:32:22.329 --> 01:32:25.957
Here is Muhammad Ali!

01:32:27.251 --> 01:32:31.297
His opponent,
from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

01:32:31.756 --> 01:32:34.008
he's wearing green trunks:

01:32:34.425 --> 01:32:36.470
Who's that laughing with Cattano?

01:32:37.179 --> 01:32:39.264
How'd he get so fucking close to the ring?

01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:42.476
The Heavyweight Champion of the World,

01:32:42.601 --> 01:32:45.480
Joe Frazier!

01:32:47.857 --> 01:32:51.195
Hey, Frank.
You gonna keep that hat on all night?

01:32:51.362 --> 01:32:52.363
I'm gonna miss the fight.

01:32:52.488 --> 01:32:54.198
You paid for it.

01:32:57.618 --> 01:32:59.121
Joe, over here!

01:33:39.458 --> 01:33:41.460
This guy, he's a supplier
at most: Or just a pimp:

01:33:41.585 --> 01:33:42.627
Otherwise we'd know his name:

01:33:42.753 --> 01:33:46.548
His tickets were phenomenal.
Better seats than Dominic Cattano. Right?

01:33:47.216 --> 01:33:49.218
Joe Louis shook his hand.

01:33:50.261 --> 01:33:52.263
Who the fuck is this guy?

01:33:56.101 --> 01:33:57.436
What's this?

01:33:57.603 --> 01:33:59.772
That's the plate off the limo.

01:33:59.938 --> 01:34:01.857
Check with the company who rented it.

01:34:05.403 --> 01:34:08.448
Right there, Mr Lucas. Right there. Good.

01:34:09.908 --> 01:34:12.370
Can I get a shot here, Frank? Right here.

01:34:12.495 --> 01:34:13.913
Looking good, Frank.

01:34:14.747 --> 01:34:15.748
Beautiful.

01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:19.126
Right on, Frank!

01:34:19.251 --> 01:34:20.921
Congratulations!

01:34:26.843 --> 01:34:28.721
She's the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

01:34:28.846 --> 01:34:32.433
That's my sunshine right there, Mr Williams.
I wish Bumpy had met her.

01:34:32.558 --> 01:34:33.893
Throw it to me!

01:34:38.857 --> 01:34:40.359
Get a picture.

01:34:50.203 --> 01:34:51.831
Come here, baby.

01:35:16.650 --> 01:35:18.819
- What's happening?
Sit tight.

01:35:20.487 --> 01:35:22.656
Congratulations, Frank.

01:35:22.823 --> 01:35:23.991
Detective.

01:35:24.117 --> 01:35:27.328
So, you sure you done the right thing?
I mean, she's a beautiful girl and all...

01:35:27.579 --> 01:35:29.706
Hey, hey, listen, listen.

01:35:30.665 --> 01:35:32.710
Before you say anything
about me or about my wife,

01:35:32.835 --> 01:35:35.337
understand this is the most important day
of my life, Detective.

01:35:35.504 --> 01:35:36.964
Oh, I understand. I understand.

01:35:37.089 --> 01:35:39.550
You know, a man who
walks around in a $50,000 chinchilla coat

01:35:39.675 --> 01:35:41.845
and never even bought me a cup of coffee.

01:35:42.012 --> 01:35:45.307
There's something wrong there.
Pay your bills, Frank?

01:35:46.767 --> 01:35:47.809
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:35:47.934 --> 01:35:48.936
Do you pay your bills, I asked you?

01:35:49.062 --> 01:35:50.146
If you're not getting your share,

01:35:50.271 --> 01:35:51.606
maybe you need
to talk to the Chief of Police.

01:35:51.731 --> 01:35:55.151
What's my share?
'Cause you don't even fucking know me.

01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:57.154
Maybe I'm special.

01:35:57.279 --> 01:35:59.073
You are special.

01:35:59.198 --> 01:36:00.824
You see that right there?

01:36:00.949 --> 01:36:03.202
Special Investigations Unit.

01:36:04.454 --> 01:36:05.705
Special.

01:36:06.581 --> 01:36:08.500
Get it?

01:36:08.625 --> 01:36:13.464
Ten grand. First of each month.
Deliver it right here.

01:36:13.631 --> 01:36:16.133
- Are you done?
- Oh, yeah, I'm done.

01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:22.349
Don't forget your card.
Have a nice fucking honeymoon.

01:36:22.474 --> 01:36:23.725
Let's go.

01:37:23.375 --> 01:37:25.002
His name is Frank Lucas:

01:37:25.128 --> 01:37:27.922
Originally from Greensboro, North Carolina:

01:37:28.048 --> 01:37:33.053
A couple of arrests years ago.
Gambling and unlicensed firearm.

01:37:33.387 --> 01:37:37.767
For 15 years, he was Bumpy Johnson's
driver, bodyguard and collector.

01:37:39.518 --> 01:37:41.396
He was with him when he died.

01:37:41.521 --> 01:37:46.318
He's got five brothers.
He's the oldest. And a lot of cousins.

01:37:47.444 --> 01:37:48.487
They all living up here now,

01:37:48.612 --> 01:37:51.449
spread throughout the five boroughs
and Jersey.

01:37:51.574 --> 01:37:53.785
The brothers are Dexter,

01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:56.120
- in Brooklyn: He's a dry cleaner:
- What can I do for you?

01:37:56.245 --> 01:37:58.874
- I'm picking up.
Yeah:

01:37:58.999 --> 01:38:03.128
Melvin in Queens has got
a custom furniture and fire doors business:

01:38:04.421 --> 01:38:05.548
- That's it right here?
- Right there.

01:38:05.673 --> 01:38:08.885
Terrence in Newark,
he has a hardware store:

01:38:09.844 --> 01:38:12.389
Turner in the Bronx has got a tyre shop:

01:38:14.016 --> 01:38:16.811
And Huey Lucas in Bergen County
has a body shop:

01:38:16.936 --> 01:38:18.687
- Is your manager here?
- That's my price.

01:38:18.854 --> 01:38:20.398
Oh, man, I'm gonna take it
somewhere else, all right?

01:38:20.523 --> 01:38:23.652
These businesses are
the distribution and collection points

01:38:23.777 --> 01:38:25.737
for Frank's dope and Frank's money:

01:38:26.822 --> 01:38:32.328
Everything about Frank's life seems
unpretentious, orderly and legitimate.

01:38:33.079 --> 01:38:35.581
He starts early, gets up at 5:00 a: M:

01:38:35.706 --> 01:38:39.503
Has breakfast in a diner
in Harlem every morning, usually by himself:

01:38:39.628 --> 01:38:40.629
Then he starts work:

01:38:40.754 --> 01:38:44.174
Takes a meeting with the accountant
or with his lawyer:

01:38:44.299 --> 01:38:47.512
At nights, he usually stays at home:
And if he does go out,

01:38:47.637 --> 01:38:51.683
it's to one of two clubs or
a handful of restaurants with his new wife:

01:38:51.808 --> 01:38:53.601
- Some ball players:
- That's fucking Wilt Chamberlain.

01:38:53.727 --> 01:38:58.023
Friends, musicians:
Never, never with organised crime guys:

01:38:58.149 --> 01:39:00.901
Sundays, he takes his mother to church:

01:39:01.444 --> 01:39:02.946
Then he drives out and he changes

01:39:03.071 --> 01:39:07.075
the flowers on Bumpy's grave.
Every Sunday, no matter what.

01:39:07.951 --> 01:39:10.747
Not the typical day
in the life of a dope man, Richie:

01:39:10.913 --> 01:39:11.956
No:

01:39:12.081 --> 01:39:15.918
Bumpy Johnson's life wasn't typical either,
and he ran Harlem for years:

01:39:16.043 --> 01:39:19.548
So you're saying
that Frank Lucas replaced Bumpy Johnson?

01:39:19.673 --> 01:39:21.091
Yeah:
His driver?

01:39:21.216 --> 01:39:23.761
Yeah:
Sounds a little farfetched:

01:39:23.886 --> 01:39:26.431
But is it? Is it?
Because everything he does:::

01:39:26.556 --> 01:39:27.724
He's handing out turkeys, man.

01:39:27.849 --> 01:39:30.185
:: He does the same as
Bumpy would have done, right?

01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:33.396
And who was Bumpy most likely to teach?

01:39:33.521 --> 01:39:35.566
The guy he sees every day.

01:39:35.691 --> 01:39:37.943
It's like a Sicilian family:

01:39:38.110 --> 01:39:42.156
He's structured his organisation
to protect him in the same way.

01:39:42.282 --> 01:39:43.658
And if he was with Bumpy for so long,

01:39:43.784 --> 01:39:46.369
that means he would have
spent a lot of time with Italians.

01:39:46.495 --> 01:39:49.247
Definitely long enough to learn that much.

01:39:49.414 --> 01:39:53.628
But here's the thing. I don't think
it's Frank Lucas that we're after.

01:39:53.753 --> 01:39:56.714
Who we want is whoever Frank Lucas
is working for.

01:39:56.839 --> 01:39:58.842
It's whoever's actually
bringing the heroin in.

01:39:58.967 --> 01:40:05.557
Okay. So what do you have on him
that will stick in court? Because this isn't it.

01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:10.855
Without powder, without informants,
no one's going to jail.

01:40:11.356 --> 01:40:12.524
That's understood, sir.

01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:13.900
And I don't think we're gonna
get informants, not from inside the family,

01:40:15.361 --> 01:40:17.613
And I don't think we're gonna
get informants, not from inside the family,

01:40:17.738 --> 01:40:19.615
you know, unless we get very, very lucky.

01:40:22.535 --> 01:40:27.332
Straight up lab tests suggesting
purity's consistent with Asian dope.

01:40:28.375 --> 01:40:31.421
The Italians, we know,
usually work with other Europeans

01:40:31.546 --> 01:40:33.464
or with the Turks.

01:40:34.298 --> 01:40:39.555
We got small blue packets turning up in
neighbourhoods all over the Tri-State area.

01:40:40.013 --> 01:40:42.391
From Chinatown, to Harlem,
Washington Heights

01:40:42.516 --> 01:40:44.643
Richmond Avenue and Staten Island.

01:40:44.768 --> 01:40:47.564
They got North Orange, Princeton, Bayonne,
Newark,

01:40:48.606 --> 01:40:52.193
Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo,
and all the way through Connecticut.

01:40:52.318 --> 01:40:54.237
The same dope.

01:41:02.329 --> 01:41:04.124
That's it, down there.

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.397
And it's Three Counts
as they round the turn for home now:

01:41:48.882 --> 01:41:51.051
Okay, let's all join hands.

01:41:55.431 --> 01:41:58.101
Lord, we thank You for this
food we're about to receive,

01:41:58.267 --> 01:42:00.145
the nourishments of our bodies.

01:42:00.312 --> 01:42:04.691
Feed our souls with heavenly grace,
in Jesus' name and for His sake.

01:42:05.150 --> 01:42:06.860
- Amen.
Amen.

01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:27.217
Shh. Shh.

01:42:27.342 --> 01:42:30.429
Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Come on, now.

01:42:31.931 --> 01:42:33.015
It's okay.

01:42:34.308 --> 01:42:38.104
- You better get yourself ready, old man.
- Come on, big man. Throw the ball.

01:42:38.271 --> 01:42:40.816
Get yourself ready, old man. All right!

01:42:40.983 --> 01:42:43.735
Come on, now. Your pop said
you had an arm on you. Come on!

01:42:43.861 --> 01:42:46.363
I'm gonna set your ass
in the grass, Uncle Melvin.

01:42:46.530 --> 01:42:49.033
Hey! Watch your mouth, boy.
Throw the ball!

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:51.953
Damn, Uncle Melvin,
I'm a pitcher, not an outfielder!

01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:54.122
Steve. Steve, come here.

01:42:55.457 --> 01:42:56.417
Come, sit down.

01:42:56.584 --> 01:42:58.878
Uncle Frank. What's happening?

01:42:59.712 --> 01:43:01.005
How you doing?

01:43:01.172 --> 01:43:02.131
Cool.

01:43:02.298 --> 01:43:03.549
You want a drink?

01:43:03.716 --> 01:43:05.260
You know better than that.

01:43:05.385 --> 01:43:06.845
Just checking.

01:43:09.181 --> 01:43:12.351
Why didn't you show up
for that meeting, Steve?

01:43:13.186 --> 01:43:16.272
I set it up with the Yankees and Billy Martin.

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:20.152
Why didn't you show up?

01:43:22.571 --> 01:43:24.198
Don't lie to me.

01:43:24.782 --> 01:43:27.242
I don't want to play ball no more.

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:28.912
- I decided.
- What you talking about?

01:43:29.079 --> 01:43:31.039
You decided? Decided what?

01:43:31.206 --> 01:43:32.999
- That ain't what I want.
- What you talking about?

01:43:33.166 --> 01:43:34.459
You've been playing
since you was a little boy.

01:43:34.626 --> 01:43:36.337
You were ready to go into the pros.
What you...

01:43:36.504 --> 01:43:38.714
Frank! We got a problem, man.

01:43:42.051 --> 01:43:43.677
What do you want?

01:43:45.263 --> 01:43:47.682
I want what you got, Uncle Frank.

01:43:47.849 --> 01:43:49.476
I want to be you.

01:44:09.207 --> 01:44:12.627
He's been diluting it so much.
We're down 2%, 3% pure.

01:44:12.752 --> 01:44:15.213
And you tested it? You're sure?

01:44:15.338 --> 01:44:16.423
Yeah.

01:44:21.429 --> 01:44:22.596
Fuck you looking at?

01:45:15.031 --> 01:45:16.616
My man.

01:45:18.409 --> 01:45:20.036
- Welcome, Frank.
- How you doing, Nick?

01:45:21.371 --> 01:45:23.248
It's all great. Welcome.

01:45:23.373 --> 01:45:25.334
- I need to talk to you.
- Great. Come on.

01:45:25.459 --> 01:45:30.131
Hey, you all, everybody get out! Let's go.
Come on! Hurry up!

01:45:31.674 --> 01:45:34.094
Sit, my brother.

01:45:35.512 --> 01:45:37.765
I take it you talked to Charlie.

01:45:38.933 --> 01:45:41.310
Guess you wanna hear more
about my Black coalition.

01:45:41.435 --> 01:45:42.937
- Let me explain to you...
- No, no, no.

01:45:43.062 --> 01:45:46.024
I'm all right.
That's not what I came here for, Nick.

01:45:47.359 --> 01:45:48.860
Yeah, everybody's good, Nick.

01:45:48.985 --> 01:45:51.947
You know, everybody's happy.
Charlie, Baz, the Italians,

01:45:52.072 --> 01:45:54.158
you know, Johnny Law.
Everybody's happy except you.

01:45:54.283 --> 01:45:56.828
- I'm happy, Frank.
- You happy? Really?

01:45:56.953 --> 01:46:00.331
Well, maybe I'm the one with the problem.
Yeah, go on. Get one.

01:46:00.456 --> 01:46:01.542
All right.

01:46:01.917 --> 01:46:02.918
I gotta problem 'cause

01:46:03.043 --> 01:46:07.381
I don't understand why you gotta take
something that's perfectly good

01:46:07.506 --> 01:46:09.174
and mess it up.

01:46:09.424 --> 01:46:11.928
See, brand names.
Brand names mean something. Understand?

01:46:13.263 --> 01:46:14.597
Shut the fuck up!

01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:18.811
Go ahead, Frank.
I'm sorry about that bullshit.

01:46:18.936 --> 01:46:20.271
Blue Magic.

01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:24.483
That's a brand name.
Like Pepsi, that's a brand name.

01:46:24.608 --> 01:46:27.320
I stand behind it. I guarantee it.

01:46:27.446 --> 01:46:29.573
They know that, even if they don't know me
any more than

01:46:29.698 --> 01:46:32.242
they know the chairman of General Mills.

01:46:32.367 --> 01:46:33.660
What the fuck are you talking about, Frank?

01:46:33.785 --> 01:46:36.622
What I'm talking about is
when you chop my dope down

01:46:36.747 --> 01:46:41.377
to one, two, three, four, five percent
and then you call it Blue Magic,

01:46:41.502 --> 01:46:44.631
that is trademark infringement.
You understand what I'm saying?

01:46:44.756 --> 01:46:47.217
With all due respect, Frank,
if I buy something, I own it.

01:46:47.342 --> 01:46:48.594
No, that ain't true. That ain't true.

01:46:48.719 --> 01:46:50.889
If I buy a car, and I wanna paint it,
I can paint the motherfucker.

01:46:51.055 --> 01:46:52.182
Yeah, but you don't have to.

01:46:52.307 --> 01:46:55.310
This is what I'm saying to you, Nick, you
don't have to. Good enough the way it is.

01:46:55.435 --> 01:46:58.189
You can make enough money off it
the way it is, just by calling it Blue Magic.

01:46:58.314 --> 01:47:00.107
Anything more than that is greed, son.

01:47:00.232 --> 01:47:02.109
What you want, Frank?
You want me to change the name on it?

01:47:02.234 --> 01:47:04.278
I would have to insist
that you change the name.

01:47:04.403 --> 01:47:08.200
Fine by me, Frank. I'll call it Red Magic,
even though that don't sound as good.

01:47:08.325 --> 01:47:11.203
I don't give a fuck what you call it.
Put a chokehold on the motherfucker

01:47:11.328 --> 01:47:13.914
and call it Blue Dog Shit,
you know what I mean?

01:47:14.039 --> 01:47:18.252
I don't care, just don't let me catch you
doing this again.

01:47:18.377 --> 01:47:21.047
Catch me? Infringement? Insist?

01:47:21.172 --> 01:47:22.925
I don't like these words as much as,

01:47:23.050 --> 01:47:25.761
"Please, thank you,
I'm sorry to bother you, Nicky."

01:47:25.886 --> 01:47:27.971
These are better words you use to come
to my motherfucking club

01:47:28.096 --> 01:47:30.642
without an invitation! You hear me?

01:47:31.684 --> 01:47:32.894
My man.

01:47:41.529 --> 01:47:43.656
Oh, shit. Fuck, is that the cops there, man?

01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:55.378
It's all right.

01:47:56.462 --> 01:47:59.382
The hell they're gonna do, give us a ticket?

01:47:59.507 --> 01:48:01.717
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

01:48:03.637 --> 01:48:04.638
What?

01:48:04.763 --> 01:48:06.890
Some of it's in the trunk.

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.394
- How you doing, Frank?
- I'm good. How you doing, Detective?

01:48:10.519 --> 01:48:11.938
How was your Thanksgiving?

01:48:12.063 --> 01:48:14.399
Not so good, as a matter of fact.
Why don't you get out of the car?

01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:21.073
Come on, give me the fucking keys.

01:48:21.198 --> 01:48:23.409
- Where's the Shelby at?
- The Shelby's gone, Frank.

01:48:23.534 --> 01:48:24.910
- The Shelby's gone?
- Stay right there.

01:48:25.035 --> 01:48:26.913
Yes, sir. Right here.

01:48:27.998 --> 01:48:29.583
You got anything
worth looking at in here?

01:48:29.708 --> 01:48:31.418
Hey, that's that Trupo guy.

01:48:31.543 --> 01:48:33.086
Is that him?
Yeah.

01:48:33.211 --> 01:48:34.713
Fucking prick.

01:48:37.967 --> 01:48:40.344
- Come over here a minute, Frank.
- Yeah.

01:48:42.638 --> 01:48:43.682
What are we gonna do about this?

01:48:43.807 --> 01:48:46.226
We don't do shit about it.
We close it up, throw it back in the trunk,

01:48:46.351 --> 01:48:48.937
everybody go home,
have some pumpkin pie, warm apple cider.

01:48:49.062 --> 01:48:50.814
I got a better idea.

01:48:51.983 --> 01:48:55.320
Or would you rather me throw you
and your brother in the fucking river?

01:48:55.487 --> 01:48:58.490
Would you rather your house
blows up next time?

01:49:02.703 --> 01:49:04.955
- I loved that car.
- I know.

01:49:08.335 --> 01:49:11.379
What's he doing? Shakedown!

01:49:12.088 --> 01:49:14.257
Somebody's getting some money
for the Benevolent Fund.

01:49:14.382 --> 01:49:15.384
Look at that shit.

01:49:16.052 --> 01:49:17.345
Sorry, Frank.

01:49:17.512 --> 01:49:19.722
It's all right. Go and get in the car.

01:49:43.124 --> 01:49:45.543
All right, you call me back.

01:49:46.877 --> 01:49:50.715
INS, IRS, FBI.
I can't get a damn thing out of any of them.

01:49:50.882 --> 01:49:54.261
Because they all think you're on the take.
And you think they are.

01:49:58.015 --> 01:49:59.308
You know,
I don't think they want this to stop.

01:49:59.475 --> 01:50:01.644
I think it employs too many people.

01:50:01.811 --> 01:50:07.860
Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians,
prison guards, probation officers.

01:50:08.485 --> 01:50:09.570
They stop bringing dope into this country,

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:12.407
about 100,000 people
are going to be out of a job.

01:50:15.743 --> 01:50:18.663
Spearman.

01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:22.168
FBI. Here to see Detective Roberts.

01:50:26.839 --> 01:50:30.469
So who took it out? Somebody I know?
My wife?

01:50:31.887 --> 01:50:35.223
Come on, if somebody's taking a contract
out on my life, I'd like to know.

01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:38.936
I can't say without compromising
our source. You understand?

01:50:39.103 --> 01:50:41.439
No. Not when it's my life,
I don't understand.

01:50:41.606 --> 01:50:44.776
- If you want we can assign someone to you.
- FBI protection.

01:50:45.736 --> 01:50:49.114
You know what? My life
is dangerous enough as it is.

01:50:50.449 --> 01:50:52.243
Well, we'll let you get back
to your business.

01:50:52.410 --> 01:50:56.831
Okay. Larry, Bob.
Thanks for visiting The Garden State.

01:50:56.998 --> 01:50:57.999
Take care.

01:50:58.166 --> 01:51:00.461
Hey, what do you know
about Frank Lucas?

01:51:00.628 --> 01:51:03.964
We know that you keep calling about him.

01:51:13.725 --> 01:51:18.189
We believe that peace is at hand:

01:51:20.274 --> 01:51:24.696
We believe that an agreement
is within sight:

01:51:27.533 --> 01:51:30.619
As I said earlier:::

01:51:35.166 --> 01:51:36.167
Yeah.

01:51:37.377 --> 01:51:39.295
Hey, Joey. Hi.

01:51:41.257 --> 01:51:44.093
All right. Yeah, tomorrow. Why?

01:52:04.073 --> 01:52:05.117
What the fuck is a microwave?

01:52:05.284 --> 01:52:08.245
It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.

01:52:08.412 --> 01:52:10.164
- Yeah?
Yeah.

01:52:10.330 --> 01:52:12.374
It rearranges the molecules.

01:52:12.541 --> 01:52:14.586
Of what?
Of what? Of popcorn.

01:52:17.797 --> 01:52:20.550
Of your head. Stick it in. Go on.

01:52:23.929 --> 01:52:25.890
I can get you one of those.

01:52:26.056 --> 01:52:29.311
Brand new, just like this.
I'll have it delivered.

01:52:29.769 --> 01:52:31.313
No, thank you.

01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:42.992
Hey. Where is that?

01:52:43.159 --> 01:52:47.456
Aspen. We just got back.
Had a great time. You know who we met?

01:52:47.623 --> 01:52:49.291
Who?

01:52:49.458 --> 01:52:51.168
Burt Reynolds.

01:52:51.335 --> 01:52:55.006
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm not kidding.

01:52:55.173 --> 01:52:59.052
A lot people from Hollywood go up
there now. They're buying up everything.

01:52:59.219 --> 01:53:00.803
- This is your place?
- Mmm.

01:53:00.970 --> 01:53:04.767
You know what that's worth?
Ski in, ski out. Five bedrooms.

01:53:04.934 --> 01:53:08.020
Sauna. Everything. We were guests.

01:53:12.776 --> 01:53:14.402
It's your place.

01:53:29.545 --> 01:53:32.005
Isn't there something we can do,

01:53:33.925 --> 01:53:36.761
about leaving the big guy alone?

01:53:36.886 --> 01:53:38.721
You know who I mean.

01:53:38.888 --> 01:53:42.393
I don't report what you just said,
I can get in a lot of trouble.

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:45.312
I do report it, then the trouble is yours.

01:53:47.565 --> 01:53:49.818
I'm hoping you won't do that.

01:53:50.694 --> 01:53:53.196
Richie, come on. I'm not taping it.

01:53:53.363 --> 01:53:56.449
How do you know? Because we're friends.

01:53:56.575 --> 01:53:58.911
And I'm telling you, this is a real offer.

01:53:59.078 --> 01:54:00.913
From who? Your uncle?

01:54:04.667 --> 01:54:07.129
Why would you do this?
Why would you risk our friendship?

01:54:07.296 --> 01:54:08.589
Because

01:54:10.924 --> 01:54:13.177
I care what happens to you.

01:54:15.305 --> 01:54:17.098
You shouldn't have done this.

01:54:17.265 --> 01:54:20.393
I had to, I had no choice.
Neither do you. Richie!

01:54:21.186 --> 01:54:24.940
You don't have a choice.
Just leave Frank Lucas alone.

01:54:26.692 --> 01:54:28.152
Frank Lucas?

01:54:29.361 --> 01:54:30.447
Yeah.

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:36.036
You tell Marie I had to leave. I'm sorry.

01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:38.331
Tell her why.

01:55:21.254 --> 01:55:22.713
- Talk! Talk!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:55:22.839 --> 01:55:25.091
- Are you Richie Roberts?
- Yes, so what?

01:55:25.925 --> 01:55:28.053
You've been served. I'm sorry.

01:55:42.443 --> 01:55:43.404
All right.

01:55:47.616 --> 01:55:48.701
Laurie.

01:55:50.787 --> 01:55:54.457
Look, I'm sorry I never gave you
the kind of life you wanted, all right.

01:55:54.624 --> 01:55:56.877
I'm sorry it was never enough.

01:56:00.047 --> 01:56:02.633
Don't punish me for being honest.

01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.719
Don't take my boy away.

01:56:07.139 --> 01:56:10.434
What are you saying?
That because you were honest

01:56:10.642 --> 01:56:13.729
and you didn't take money
like every other cop, I left you?

01:56:13.896 --> 01:56:16.399
No, you don't take money for one reason.

01:56:16.566 --> 01:56:19.694
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.

01:56:19.861 --> 01:56:21.779
And that's worse than taking money
nobody gives a shit about.

01:56:21.988 --> 01:56:25.201
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.

01:56:25.367 --> 01:56:28.746
You know, I'd rather you took it
and been honest with me.

01:56:28.913 --> 01:56:31.583
Or don't take it. I don't care.
But then don't go cheat on me.

01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:33.585
Don't cheat on your kid
by never being around.

01:56:33.752 --> 01:56:37.964
Don't go out and get laid by your snitches
and your secretaries and strippers!

01:56:38.089 --> 01:56:40.843
I can tell by just looking, she's one of them.

01:56:40.968 --> 01:56:42.011
You...

01:56:42.178 --> 01:56:46.724
You think you're going to heaven
because you're honest, but you're not.

01:56:46.891 --> 01:56:49.394
You're going to the same hell
as the crooked cops you can't stand.

01:56:50.729 --> 01:56:52.272
All rise.

01:56:56.694 --> 01:56:58.863
Please be seated.

01:56:59.864 --> 01:57:04.161
Miss Dickerson,
before the court renders its opinion,

01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:06.956
is there anything else
you'd like to be heard on?

01:57:07.122 --> 01:57:08.832
Yes, Your Honour.

01:57:08.958 --> 01:57:12.045
Your Honour, a lot has been said here today
about how unsavoury

01:57:12.212 --> 01:57:16.132
Mr Roberts' environment is for a child.
How dangerous it is.

01:57:16.299 --> 01:57:20.012
We tell him to protect us.
We give him that responsibility,

01:57:20.221 --> 01:57:22.682
but then say, "Oh, we don't trust you
to raise a child.

01:57:22.890 --> 01:57:24.350
"We don't think you're fit for that."

01:57:24.517 --> 01:57:26.060
I'm not.

01:57:26.894 --> 01:57:28.355
You're right.

01:57:29.565 --> 01:57:31.984
Being around me is no place for a kid.

01:57:32.150 --> 01:57:35.320
You take him to Vegas.
I'll come see him when I can.

01:57:38.283 --> 01:57:41.995
Your Honour, I want to apologise
for wasting the court's time.

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.468
Doc.

01:57:55.635 --> 01:57:57.012
I see them.

01:57:57.137 --> 01:57:58.597
There he is.

01:58:17.118 --> 01:58:18.745
The fuck is this guy doing?

01:58:19.537 --> 01:58:20.830
Hey!
- Champagne.

01:58:20.997 --> 01:58:23.124
Merry Christmas, Detectives.
- For us?

01:58:23.291 --> 01:58:25.085
Yeah. Enjoy that.

01:58:25.461 --> 01:58:27.755
- You fellas have a good time.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:58:28.964 --> 01:58:30.507
It's Cristal.

01:58:34.638 --> 01:58:36.890
South Vietnamese troops
called in air strikes

01:58:37.057 --> 01:58:39.893
on Communist positions inside the city:

01:58:41.479 --> 01:58:44.148
Paying off Johnny Law, that's one thing.

01:58:44.273 --> 01:58:45.233
There ain't no problem with that.

01:58:45.399 --> 01:58:48.403
I've been paying off the police
since I was 10 years old.

01:58:48.570 --> 01:58:51.323
Put more of their kids through college
than the National Merit Award.

01:58:51.490 --> 01:58:53.200
Give me one of them round one... Yeah.

01:58:53.325 --> 01:58:55.202
This is different, though. These...

01:58:55.369 --> 01:58:59.207
Special Investigative Unit. That's
their problem. They think they're special.

01:58:59.415 --> 01:59:01.960
Fucking crooks. No code of ethics.

01:59:02.126 --> 01:59:03.086
What do you think?

01:59:03.253 --> 01:59:05.673
Looks great. It's beautiful.

01:59:05.839 --> 01:59:06.924
Good.

01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:09.552
The police, that ain't the only somebody
I'm worried about.

01:59:09.718 --> 01:59:12.639
I seeing cars where I ain't never seen them
before, people I don't know.

01:59:12.806 --> 01:59:14.057
Yeah, me, too.

01:59:14.224 --> 01:59:15.684
Ho, ho, ho.

01:59:15.850 --> 01:59:16.935
- Merry Christmas, Charlie.
- Thank you.

01:59:19.896 --> 01:59:22.275
- Merry Christmas, Charlie.
- Thank you.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.068
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:59:24.193 --> 01:59:26.028
Here, take this.

01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:28.030
A quick toast, and then I'll be off.

01:59:28.949 --> 01:59:33.161
What happened here was an
accident of war: Somebody made a mistake:

01:59:34.162 --> 01:59:38.793
Bumpy ain't hardly ever go out no more.
After a certain point he stayed in the house.

01:59:41.546 --> 01:59:43.756
Watch TV.

01:59:45.009 --> 01:59:47.011
Play chess. Read the newspaper.

01:59:48.679 --> 01:59:52.934
I thought he was just trying to lead the
quiet life, but no, he couldn't go nowhere.

01:59:53.059 --> 01:59:56.187
- Not without something happening.
- Frankie...

01:59:56.354 --> 01:59:59.733
- We can still go out.
- With who? Where?

01:59:59.858 --> 02:00:03.279
- Well, with...
- But I know he's under surveillance.

02:00:04.405 --> 02:00:07.992
Ain't gonna be no Christmas time
with my family being here no more.

02:00:08.117 --> 02:00:11.246
Why don't you just pay
who you have to pay?

02:00:11.371 --> 02:00:15.709
I do pay them. I pay thousands and millions
to dope dealers, crooks, cops.

02:00:16.168 --> 02:00:18.504
I pay everybody.
I pay more than they should get.

02:00:18.630 --> 02:00:20.757
I can't satisfy nobody!

02:00:20.882 --> 02:00:25.054
It's like dope! Everybody's strung out!
The more you give 'em, the more they want.

02:00:25.179 --> 02:00:27.473
They expect more.

02:00:28.557 --> 02:00:30.726
Give more and they want more.

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:37.484
Do you want to go out?

02:00:38.485 --> 02:00:40.445
All right, baby.
Put something of what you got.

02:00:40.570 --> 02:00:41.739
- Should I?
- Yeah.

02:00:41.864 --> 02:00:43.032
That's Christmas spirit.

02:00:43.157 --> 02:00:45.409
That's what I'm talking about. Feliz Navidad:

02:00:45.535 --> 02:00:46.994
- Something nice?
- Mmm-hmm.

02:00:54.753 --> 02:00:56.296
We're going to have a great time.

02:00:56.421 --> 02:00:57.465
That's right, chica:

02:00:57.590 --> 02:01:00.093
Mr Lucas. Enjoy your evening.

02:01:00.218 --> 02:01:01.302
It's all clear.

02:01:06.725 --> 02:01:07.810
Nicky!

02:01:07.977 --> 02:01:09.687
Who is that?
There's your boy, Nicky. See him?

02:01:09.853 --> 02:01:10.854
Know what I'm saying?

02:01:10.980 --> 02:01:13.525
Yeah, I see him. Let's keep going.

02:01:14.276 --> 02:01:15.360
Around back?

02:01:15.485 --> 02:01:18.488
Hell, no.
I ain't sneaking into my own club.

02:01:18.947 --> 02:01:20.824
- Incredible.
- Huh?

02:01:43.141 --> 02:01:44.309
Come on.

02:01:47.438 --> 02:01:48.439
Hold on. Hold on.

02:01:56.907 --> 02:01:57.908
What?

02:01:58.074 --> 02:01:59.868
I want to wait in the car.

02:01:59.993 --> 02:02:02.997
Frank, I got it. I got it. I'll wait for it. I got it.

02:02:03.456 --> 02:02:05.416
- Get that yellow sauce.
- Yellow sauce.

02:02:05.541 --> 02:02:07.585
And the chicken. The Kung Pao chicken.

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:15.844
Can you turn the heater on?

02:02:21.976 --> 02:02:24.270
Shit. I'm gonna go get the keys.

02:02:38.119 --> 02:02:40.580
- Doc, give me the keys.
Here you go.

02:02:46.379 --> 02:02:47.630
Doc!

02:02:51.802 --> 02:02:53.595
Get out of the car.

02:03:00.019 --> 02:03:01.980
You okay?
- Yeah.

02:03:02.105 --> 02:03:03.106
Shit.

02:03:03.273 --> 02:03:04.274
Come on.

02:03:04.482 --> 02:03:06.443
Come on, baby. You all right?

02:03:07.486 --> 02:03:08.737
Let's go.

02:03:29.343 --> 02:03:31.054
Was it Nicky?

02:03:32.556 --> 02:03:34.850
We'll go right now and fucking kill him
whether it was him or not,

02:03:35.017 --> 02:03:36.977
you say the word, Frankie.

02:03:38.478 --> 02:03:40.773
We got to do something, Frank.

02:03:41.232 --> 02:03:42.233
We can't just sit here.

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:43.860
We're leaving.

02:03:46.947 --> 02:03:48.574
- All right, everybody get out.
You all right, man?

02:03:48.741 --> 02:03:50.951
Go on home. It's Christmas time.
Go and be with your families.

02:03:51.076 --> 02:03:52.328
I'm all right.

02:03:52.536 --> 02:03:55.624
Go on. Go ahead. Be with your kids.

02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:57.042
Go ahead.

02:04:09.055 --> 02:04:10.056
Where are we gonna go, huh?

02:04:10.264 --> 02:04:11.808
We're gonna go to Spain, somewhere?
China?

02:04:11.975 --> 02:04:15.395
Huh? Come on, sit down.
Tell me where you want to go.

02:04:16.104 --> 02:04:19.025
Frank, we can go anywhere we want.

02:04:19.192 --> 02:04:20.735
- No, we can't.
- We can live anywhere, Frank.

02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:22.820
Where? And do what? Run? Hide?

02:04:22.987 --> 02:04:25.907
Frank Lucas don't run from nobody, baby.

02:04:26.032 --> 02:04:27.743
We ain't going nowhere.
We're gonna stay right here.

02:04:27.952 --> 02:04:30.162
We're gonna stay right here.
This is my home.

02:04:30.329 --> 02:04:33.582
This is where my business is,
my wife, my mother, my family.

02:04:33.749 --> 02:04:36.211
My country. I ain't going nowhere.

02:04:36.795 --> 02:04:39.005
I ain't running from nobody!

02:04:40.257 --> 02:04:41.883
This is America.

02:04:48.808 --> 02:04:51.353
And you ain't going nowhere, either!

02:04:53.605 --> 02:04:54.690
Huh?

02:04:56.984 --> 02:04:59.111
A ceasefire, internationally supervised,

02:04:59.236 --> 02:05:01.655
will begin at 7:00 p: M: This Saturday,
January 27th, Washington time:

02:05:01.690 --> 02:05:04.075
Will begin at 7:00 p: M: This Saturday,
January 27th, Washington time:

02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:06.327
I'll call you back.

02:05:06.494 --> 02:05:08.956
Hey! What are you doing?

02:05:10.916 --> 02:05:12.084
Richie.

02:05:15.964 --> 02:05:17.048
Wow.

02:05:19.342 --> 02:05:24.056
So, what I hear it was the Corsican mob
took a shot at Frank.

02:05:24.181 --> 02:05:26.058
You know, French Connection,
Fernando Rey,

02:05:26.225 --> 02:05:29.395
the exporters that Frank
has put out of business.

02:05:29.979 --> 02:05:32.107
Look, I can take care of him in New York.

02:05:32.232 --> 02:05:33.609
I just don't want to have
to worry that every time

02:05:33.775 --> 02:05:35.235
he drives across the bridge to Jersey,

02:05:35.402 --> 02:05:38.155
someone's gonna take another shot at him.

02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:41.868
Richie, you and I gotta
start working together.

02:05:42.035 --> 02:05:44.662
We need to step up our efforts.

02:05:44.787 --> 02:05:47.457
Next time, their aim could be better.

02:05:48.042 --> 02:05:50.669
We need to keep this cash cow alive.

02:05:56.426 --> 02:05:58.637
What the fuck are you doing here?

02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:00.472
Whoa!

02:06:03.725 --> 02:06:06.187
Were you actually gonna arrest
Frank Lucas?

02:06:06.354 --> 02:06:07.730
What's the matter with you?

02:06:08.064 --> 02:06:10.274
- What, you don't know?
- No.

02:06:10.942 --> 02:06:13.946
Everybody in New Jersey's crazy.

02:06:14.071 --> 02:06:17.407
You know what we do here?
Cops arrest bad guys.

02:06:19.743 --> 02:06:21.704
Before you get on that bridge again,

02:06:21.871 --> 02:06:25.208
you should call me first,
just make sure it's safe.

02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:29.880
"I'm more enlightened
than some of my friends.

02:06:30.047 --> 02:06:32.007
"I can guarantee you peace of mind."

02:06:32.174 --> 02:06:34.385
That's what you told me, Dominic.

02:06:35.719 --> 02:06:38.265
"I can guarantee you peace of mind!"

02:06:38.431 --> 02:06:40.475
I don't feel so peaceful!

02:06:41.935 --> 02:06:43.019
Huh?

02:06:45.398 --> 02:06:47.525
They tried to kill my wife!

02:06:52.113 --> 02:06:53.907
Who was that? Huh?

02:06:55.909 --> 02:06:58.203
Maybe it was one of your peoples.

02:06:58.370 --> 02:07:00.498
- I don't know yet. No.
- You don't know?

02:07:00.665 --> 02:07:02.375
You don't know.

02:07:03.626 --> 02:07:06.546
I'll tell you what I know.
Maybe I should just put 500 guns

02:07:06.713 --> 02:07:08.757
out there on the street
and just start shooting up some people,

02:07:08.882 --> 02:07:09.883
just to make a point.

02:07:10.009 --> 02:07:13.262
Frank, it was a junkie. It was a rival.
Some dumb-ass kid

02:07:13.429 --> 02:07:17.100
trying to make a name for himself.
Somebody you forgot to pay off.

02:07:17.267 --> 02:07:20.186
Someone you slighted
without even realising it.

02:07:20.312 --> 02:07:25.192
Could be someone you put out of business
from being so successful. Look at you.

02:07:25.359 --> 02:07:28.863
Success, it's got enemies, Frank.
Lots of enemies.

02:07:30.615 --> 02:07:33.076
So your success took a shot at you.
What are you gonna do now?

02:07:33.285 --> 02:07:36.955
How you gonna kill it?
You're gonna become unsuccessful?

02:07:37.915 --> 02:07:41.002
Frank, we can be successful
and have enemies, right?

02:07:41.169 --> 02:07:45.048
Or we can be unsuccessful, too, you know,
we can have friends.

02:07:45.214 --> 02:07:47.258
That's the choice we make.

02:07:48.844 --> 02:07:52.431
The final evacuation of military
and diplomatic personnel

02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:53.974
continued throughout the night,

02:07:54.141 --> 02:07:57.145
as North Vietnamese troops
marched on Saigon:

02:07:57.312 --> 02:08:02.442
The imminent fall of the city has brought
chaos and a growing sense of desperation:

02:08:11.452 --> 02:08:14.873
- Operator:
- Yeah, Bangkok, 367, international.

02:08:14.998 --> 02:08:16.375
One moment, please:

02:08:24.926 --> 02:08:26.261
Yeah, Nate:

02:08:26.386 --> 02:08:28.012
Hey, Frank. What's up, baby?

02:08:28.179 --> 02:08:29.556
What's going on over there?

02:08:29.682 --> 02:08:30.849
It's all over:

02:08:30.975 --> 02:08:32.768
Yeah, I'm watching the news.
What the hell's going on?

02:08:32.935 --> 02:08:34.561
The game's over, Frank:

02:08:34.728 --> 02:08:36.021
- Huh?
- It's done.

02:08:36.188 --> 02:08:38.149
Everybody going home, baby.
Give peace a chance.

02:08:38.275 --> 02:08:39.609
Well, look, I'm not::: Listen to me:

02:08:39.734 --> 02:08:41.278
I want two...

02:08:42.404 --> 02:08:45.073
I want 2,000 keys in the air.

02:08:45.198 --> 02:08:48.452
It's impossible, Frank:
All our resources are going home: It's over:

02:08:48.577 --> 02:08:50.371
I'll tell you what. I'm on my way over there.

02:08:50.496 --> 02:08:52.373
- Right now? Oh, come:::
- Yeah.

02:08:59.756 --> 02:09:01.884
You stole my shit?

02:09:02.051 --> 02:09:04.095
- Spearman, wake the fuck up, man.
- What?

02:09:06.097 --> 02:09:07.640
Where's my shit, Darlynn?

02:09:07.765 --> 02:09:09.727
Don't hurt me, Jimmy!

02:09:11.353 --> 02:09:13.147
Jesus! What the... Police!
Police!

02:09:13.314 --> 02:09:15.190
Drop the gun, Jimmy!
Drop the gun!

02:09:15.357 --> 02:09:17.401
Let me see your hands!
Jimmy, drop the fucking gun!

02:09:17.568 --> 02:09:20.322
I'm not playing with you, Jimmy!
I'll blast your fucking head off!

02:09:20.447 --> 02:09:22.407
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

02:09:23.992 --> 02:09:27.079
I got your gun and I got your prints.

02:09:28.331 --> 02:09:32.543
You know what you got?
You got attempted murder.

02:09:32.793 --> 02:09:34.921
Fifteen fucking years!

02:09:35.088 --> 02:09:38.425
Attempted murder is the
same as Murder One, that's a grand jury.

02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:40.761
Now, a grand jury could
come back favourably.

02:09:40.928 --> 02:09:44.015
It could be reduced to manslaughter.

02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:46.267
All right? Maybe even self-defence.

02:09:46.434 --> 02:09:48.311
It all just depends
on how we wanna deal with you.

02:09:48.436 --> 02:09:50.314
See where this is fucking going, Jimmy?

02:09:50.522 --> 02:09:51.607
Let's say you beat it.

02:09:51.732 --> 02:09:53.943
What you think your cousin Frank
is gonna think?

02:09:54.068 --> 02:09:56.362
Right, he is gonna know,
at some point in time,

02:09:56.528 --> 02:09:58.990
we sat you down,
and we talked to you like this.

02:09:59.115 --> 02:10:01.785
And then you go to court
and you beat attempted murder?

02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:05.330
What's he gonna think?
Is he stupid? Is your cousin Frank stupid?

02:10:05.497 --> 02:10:07.375
Answer him!

02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:10.252
No. He's going to assume that you talked.

02:10:13.381 --> 02:10:15.759
But right now, Frank doesn't know.

02:10:15.884 --> 02:10:18.261
You want Frank to read
about this in the papers?

02:10:18.387 --> 02:10:20.347
Or do you just want to walk out of here?

02:10:20.472 --> 02:10:24.060
No bail, no trial, no jail,
just walk out of here today:

02:10:25.228 --> 02:10:26.688
Your choice:

02:10:36.532 --> 02:10:40.996
Opium plants are hard enough
to outlive any war.

02:10:42.289 --> 02:10:46.419
They'll still be here
long after the troops have gone.

02:10:47.795 --> 02:10:52.425
What are you going to do for transportation
when the last US plane goes home?

02:10:52.925 --> 02:10:54.886
I'll figure something out.

02:10:56.471 --> 02:10:59.182
You will see me again, that's for sure.

02:11:00.517 --> 02:11:03.605
It is not in my best interest
to say this, Frank,

02:11:04.022 --> 02:11:06.941
but quitting while you're ahead

02:11:07.650 --> 02:11:09.777
is not the same as quitting.

02:11:51.408 --> 02:11:52.785
- Yeah.
- Hey:

02:11:52.910 --> 02:11:53.911
Go get him.

02:11:56.830 --> 02:11:59.125
- Whatever you want to do, baby.
- One second.

02:11:59.250 --> 02:12:00.877
- It's Frank.
- Yeah.

02:12:03.463 --> 02:12:04.464
Yeah.

02:12:04.631 --> 02:12:05.924
Newark.

02:12:06.841 --> 02:12:08.469
Short term,

02:12:09.178 --> 02:12:11.389
parking lot three.

02:12:11.555 --> 02:12:13.265
Short term, lot three.

02:12:13.432 --> 02:12:16.603
That's the Mustang we talking about, right?
Okay, right. What's the plate number?

02:12:16.770 --> 02:12:19.147
- K-A...
- K-A...

02:12:19.314 --> 02:12:21.525
:: 760:
::: 76:

02:12:21.650 --> 02:12:23.277
Zero: All right:

02:12:24.612 --> 02:12:26.572
There's no short term lot three at Newark.

02:12:26.739 --> 02:12:28.950
- They got letters. A-B-C-D.
- I know.

02:12:29.117 --> 02:12:31.160
Maybe he means a time. 3:00?

02:12:31.495 --> 02:12:36.292
This isn't no Jersey licence plate,
nor New York, for that matter.

02:12:36.458 --> 02:12:39.211
- K-A-7-6-0?
- Yep.

02:12:40.380 --> 02:12:42.007
Kilo Alpha?

02:12:42.465 --> 02:12:44.092
A plane tail number?

02:12:44.509 --> 02:12:46.469
Kilo Alpha 760.

02:12:47.596 --> 02:12:50.433
You check commercial planes.
You guys check private planes.

02:12:50.558 --> 02:12:53.144
Everything, from a little fucking Cessna
to the biggest fucking whatever jet.

02:12:53.311 --> 02:12:54.395
All right?

02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:55.981
I'll check military planes.
Where you going, Jimmy?

02:12:56.106 --> 02:12:58.942
You're not going anywhere. Sit... Sit down.

02:13:21.676 --> 02:13:23.053
- Captain?
- Yeah?

02:13:23.219 --> 02:13:27.098
Richie Roberts. Essex County.
I know you're expecting us.

02:13:27.307 --> 02:13:30.061
Here's our warrant.
We're looking on the plane.

02:13:30.227 --> 02:13:31.228
Wait! Wait!

02:13:31.437 --> 02:13:34.774
Scotty, stop all these soldiers!
Check their bags. Every one of them.

02:13:45.286 --> 02:13:47.163
No-knock warrant.

02:13:47.747 --> 02:13:50.291
- All right. Start upstairs.
- Where are they going?

02:13:50.416 --> 02:13:51.961
Step in, sweetie.

02:13:52.378 --> 02:13:53.921
Ma'am, please sit down.

02:13:54.088 --> 02:13:55.464
What is this?

02:13:56.048 --> 02:13:59.468
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
All this stops! Hey. Hey. Hey.

02:13:59.635 --> 02:14:02.889
Nothing leaves this area, all right?
Just slow down with this.

02:14:03.056 --> 02:14:05.016
- All right. Stop these trucks.
Hold on, hold on.

02:14:05.141 --> 02:14:07.018
Everything off the walls!
Just pull it all down.

02:14:07.185 --> 02:14:08.354
Damn thing's a monster, Rich.

02:14:08.479 --> 02:14:09.480
What is this?

02:14:09.605 --> 02:14:10.773
Nothing leaves this area
till we've checked it.

02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:12.233
All right, Captain. Nothing.

02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:14.443
We got to take the plane down,
we got to look in the trucks.

02:14:14.568 --> 02:14:15.736
Every man here gets searched.

02:14:15.861 --> 02:14:17.656
Read the warrant, sir.

02:14:18.407 --> 02:14:21.159
Your husband's illustrious career is over.

02:14:21.702 --> 02:14:24.872
The Feds are gonna come in,
gonna take everything.

02:14:25.289 --> 02:14:29.502
And then they're gonna take it all.
But not before I get my gratuity.

02:14:30.378 --> 02:14:31.587
So where's the money?

02:14:31.754 --> 02:14:33.215
What are you talking about? What money?

02:14:33.340 --> 02:14:34.967
What am I talking about? What money?

02:14:35.092 --> 02:14:39.138
The getaway money that Frank and
every other gangster keeps in his house.

02:14:39.305 --> 02:14:43.059
If you leave now,
there's a chance Frank might not kill you.

02:14:44.394 --> 02:14:45.937
Shut up! Sit down!

02:14:46.104 --> 02:14:47.355
Sit down!

02:15:28.068 --> 02:15:30.363
Defence today
announced the planned evacuation

02:15:30.529 --> 02:15:33.532
of all remaining US
combat forces from Vietnam,

02:15:33.658 --> 02:15:36.327
news that comes too late for some,

02:15:36.494 --> 02:15:40.082
as here, on a solemn tarmac
at Dover Air Force Base:

02:15:40.248 --> 02:15:43.752
This C-130,
loaded down with its sorrowful cargo,

02:15:43.877 --> 02:15:48.007
a cargo of America's bravest and best,
en route to their final resting places:

02:16:03.775 --> 02:16:05.318
You guys. Take this coffin down.

02:16:13.786 --> 02:16:15.413
- Open it.
- I'm not doing that.

02:16:22.212 --> 02:16:24.089
Great fucking dog, huh?

02:16:32.139 --> 02:16:34.018
You stop this, right now.

02:16:34.183 --> 02:16:37.521
My warrant gives me permission
to examine this plane,

02:16:38.522 --> 02:16:40.232
the plane and its cargo.

02:16:40.357 --> 02:16:42.818
Well, you don't have my permission.

02:16:43.570 --> 02:16:44.904
I don't need it, Captain.

02:16:46.489 --> 02:16:50.244
Easy! Easy, boy. Come on. Hey! Easy!

02:16:50.411 --> 02:16:52.538
Frank, move out of the way.

02:16:59.087 --> 02:17:00.339
Damn.

02:17:05.218 --> 02:17:06.679
That's enough!

02:17:14.228 --> 02:17:16.190
Stay with these coffins.
Do not let them out of your sight.

02:17:16.315 --> 02:17:17.858
Got it. Okay.

02:17:19.234 --> 02:17:21.361
Hey. Help me out with this.

02:17:46.014 --> 02:17:48.393
That was a military transport plane.

02:17:48.601 --> 02:17:49.686
If there was heroin onboard,

02:17:49.852 --> 02:17:51.646
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.

02:17:51.771 --> 02:17:56.235
Which means that even as it fights a war
that's claimed 50,000 American lives,

02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:58.654
the military is smuggling narcotics.

02:17:58.821 --> 02:18:01.365
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

02:18:01.531 --> 02:18:03.159
That someone employed by this office

02:18:03.325 --> 02:18:06.830
believes that the United States Army
is in the drug trafficking business

02:18:06.955 --> 02:18:10.291
and is trying to prove it
by desecrating the remains of young men

02:18:10.418 --> 02:18:13.254
who have given their lives
in the defence of democracy!

02:18:13.421 --> 02:18:15.880
- There is dope on that plane.
- Shut the fuck up!

02:18:17.466 --> 02:18:20.804
Is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,

02:18:20.929 --> 02:18:23.056
the entire federal narcotics programme
is now in jeopardy

02:18:23.223 --> 02:18:26.143
of being dismantled as completely
and enthusiastically

02:18:26.309 --> 02:18:28.103
as that fucking transport plane?

02:18:28.228 --> 02:18:30.690
That is what you've accomplished,
Mr Roberts, single-handedly.

02:18:30.857 --> 02:18:32.900
I had good information.

02:18:33.026 --> 02:18:36.447
That the target of my investigation
was bringing dope in on that plane.

02:18:36.612 --> 02:18:38.490
- And that target is?
- Frank Lucas.

02:18:38.615 --> 02:18:40.659
- Who?
- His name's Frank Lucas.

02:18:40.825 --> 02:18:43.370
Who is Frank Lucas?
Who does he work for? Which family?

02:18:43.495 --> 02:18:45.540
He's not Italian. He's black.

02:18:48.877 --> 02:18:51.714
Is that supposed to be some kind of a joke?

02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:54.091
You're this close to the end of your career
in law enforcement

02:18:54.216 --> 02:18:56.761
and you're making fucking jokes?

02:18:56.927 --> 02:18:59.138
My investigation indicates

02:18:59.348 --> 02:19:02.683
that Frank Lucas is above the Mafia
in the dope business.

02:19:02.851 --> 02:19:04.311
My investigations also indicate

02:19:04.477 --> 02:19:08.608
that Frank Lucas buys direct
from a source in Southeast Asia.

02:19:08.775 --> 02:19:11.861
He cuts out the middlemen
and uses US military planes

02:19:12.028 --> 02:19:15.782
and personnel to transport
pure number 4 heroin into the United States

02:19:15.949 --> 02:19:19.995
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.

02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:22.957
I have cases against
every member of Frank's organisation.

02:19:23.124 --> 02:19:24.209
Frank's organisation?

02:19:24.376 --> 02:19:28.129
No fucking nigger has ever accomplished
what the American Mafia hasn't in 100 years!

02:19:28.254 --> 02:19:29.339
And you would know that how? Why?

02:19:29.505 --> 02:19:31.133
'Cause your head is stuck up
your fucking ass?

02:19:31.299 --> 02:19:33.593
Hey, Lou, do me a favour.
Will you get this fucking kike out of here?

02:19:33.761 --> 02:19:35.137
Kike? Kike?

02:19:35.304 --> 02:19:36.388
Richie, no.

02:19:40.102 --> 02:19:41.561
Hey, Richie!

02:19:42.478 --> 02:19:43.939
Make it stick.

02:19:44.397 --> 02:19:47.026
Spearman's with the coffins.
They're about a quarter mile away.

02:20:18.269 --> 02:20:19.521
Doctor.

02:20:21.398 --> 02:20:22.482
What?

02:20:22.941 --> 02:20:25.944
Fucking Trupo came by the house, man.
It's bad.

02:20:40.836 --> 02:20:44.174
Frankie, I need to speak with you a minute.
Please?

02:20:44.299 --> 02:20:46.843
- I got to go, Ma.
- No, sit down just a minute.

02:20:46.968 --> 02:20:49.095
Would you please come back a little later?

02:20:49.262 --> 02:20:50.263
Thank you.

02:20:50.388 --> 02:20:52.767
- Ma, I got to go. All right?
- Just a few words.

02:20:52.933 --> 02:20:54.310
Listen to me. I got...

02:20:54.477 --> 02:20:56.771
Please, sit down. Just a few words.

02:20:56.896 --> 02:20:58.439
I've been thinking about some things.

02:20:58.564 --> 02:21:02.152
You know, if you'd been a preacher,
your brothers would have been preachers.

02:21:02.319 --> 02:21:03.320
Right.

02:21:03.445 --> 02:21:07.282
If you'd been a soldier, they'd be soldiers.
You know that.

02:21:07.407 --> 02:21:10.995
They came here because of you.
You called and they came running.

02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:12.163
Right.

02:21:12.330 --> 02:21:15.750
That's because they look up to you.

02:21:15.876 --> 02:21:20.089
They always expect you
to know what's best.

02:21:20.422 --> 02:21:22.549
But even they know

02:21:22.716 --> 02:21:24.427
you don't shoot cops.

02:21:26.638 --> 02:21:28.264
Even I know that.

02:21:29.516 --> 02:21:30.767
- Eva knows it.
- All right, Ma.

02:21:30.934 --> 02:21:33.479
The only one who doesn't seem to know
is you!

02:21:33.604 --> 02:21:36.857
All right, Ma. I got to go.
I promise you, I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

02:21:36.982 --> 02:21:40.570
I never asked you where all this came from
because I didn't want to hear you lie.

02:21:40.696 --> 02:21:42.739
I didn't want you to worry about it.
Now, come on, I got to go.

02:21:42.906 --> 02:21:44.449
Don't lie to me!

02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:50.540
Don't do that.

02:21:51.958 --> 02:21:55.294
Do you want to make things so bad

02:21:55.461 --> 02:21:58.298
for your family that they'll leave you?
Because they will.

02:21:58.424 --> 02:21:59.425
They'll understand.

02:21:59.550 --> 02:22:01.844
She will leave you.

02:22:01.969 --> 02:22:03.512
All right, Mama.

02:22:06.016 --> 02:22:07.642
I will leave you!

02:22:35.381 --> 02:22:36.717
Got coffins on the move, Richie.

02:22:36.842 --> 02:22:40.262
We want the transport coffins,
not the ceremonial ones.

02:22:41.513 --> 02:22:43.140
Who are these guys?

02:22:45.226 --> 02:22:46.770
What does it say?

02:22:49.606 --> 02:22:52.150
Bayonne Custodial Services?

02:22:52.317 --> 02:22:53.861
Bayonne Cleaning Services?

02:22:54.028 --> 02:22:55.196
Bayonne? What the fuck is that?

02:22:55.321 --> 02:22:57.114
Give me the camera, Al.

02:22:59.784 --> 02:23:00.869
Bingo.

02:23:01.036 --> 02:23:03.789
Holy shit. That's the baseball kid.

02:23:03.955 --> 02:23:05.916
Oh, yeah. That's Stevie Lucas.

02:23:06.041 --> 02:23:08.585
So what you want to do, Richie?
Follow the trucks?

02:23:08.753 --> 02:23:11.839
No. No.
I wanna stay here with the Lucas kid.

02:23:11.964 --> 02:23:13.591
We'll follow that van.

02:23:13.716 --> 02:23:17.054
You guys better eat up.
We're gonna have a long night.

02:23:27.899 --> 02:23:31.820
Come on, more precious than gold,
man. This is more precious than gold.

02:23:31.986 --> 02:23:34.907
We got a couple more.
Let's go. Stack that up.

02:23:35.491 --> 02:23:37.451
Take it. Take it.

02:23:37.576 --> 02:23:39.954
Give me a second, man,
give me a second.

02:23:41.164 --> 02:23:44.668
Hey. Yo. We got four caskets left, man.
Let's make some fucking money in here.

02:23:47.337 --> 02:23:48.422
What are they loading in there?

02:23:48.588 --> 02:23:49.757
What the fuck
are they loading in there?

02:23:49.924 --> 02:23:50.925
That's the dope.

02:23:51.092 --> 02:23:54.011
That's got to be the dope! It's got to be.

02:23:54.679 --> 02:23:55.930
Let's go.

02:23:56.848 --> 02:23:58.308
Let's move.

02:24:50.992 --> 02:24:52.369
Lou, it's Richie.

02:24:52.494 --> 02:24:54.997
We got everybody in place. Everybody.

02:24:55.164 --> 02:24:56.248
Are you sure this is it?

02:24:56.374 --> 02:24:58.167
I'm positive, man. Okay?

02:24:58.334 --> 02:24:59.960
All right, they're cutting and bagging

02:25:00.127 --> 02:25:02.881
in the South Tower
of the Stephen Crane Projects right now.

02:25:03.048 --> 02:25:05.175
Are you sure this is it?
You're positive?

02:25:05.342 --> 02:25:08.178
I'm positive, Lou: I'm positive: Okay?

02:25:08.303 --> 02:25:10.681
Everything is ready to go:
All the guys are ready to go:

02:25:10.807 --> 02:25:13.101
Just push the button,
give me the warrant, okay?

02:25:13.267 --> 02:25:14.811
Okay. You got it.

02:25:22.444 --> 02:25:23.904
You all right?

02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:18.507
- Got the warrant.
- All right.

02:26:22.053 --> 02:26:23.597
Let's go!

02:26:40.449 --> 02:26:41.658
Move!

02:26:44.745 --> 02:26:47.207
- Hi, ma'am. What's your name?
- What's going on here?

02:26:48.208 --> 02:26:50.168
Get down! Get down, motherfucker!

02:26:51.252 --> 02:26:53.922
- Go.
- Okay. Let's go, Al!

02:26:54.255 --> 02:26:55.966
Move it, come on.

02:26:56.967 --> 02:26:58.928
Come on, move it. Move it!

02:27:41.267 --> 02:27:42.351
All set.

02:27:43.145 --> 02:27:44.312
Roger.

02:27:45.939 --> 02:27:46.940
Get ready.

02:27:47.232 --> 02:27:49.109
There you go!
All right.

02:27:51.153 --> 02:27:52.155
Come on.

02:28:00.330 --> 02:28:01.582
At target.

02:28:02.374 --> 02:28:04.418
Spearman, stand by.

02:28:04.585 --> 02:28:06.962
I got civilians on the target floor:

02:28:09.799 --> 02:28:11.426
What? Oh...

02:28:11.926 --> 02:28:13.470
Come on, there you go.

02:28:13.595 --> 02:28:15.138
Hey, Tim.

02:28:15.263 --> 02:28:17.391
Girl, why don't you get
some clothes on?

02:28:21.979 --> 02:28:23.147
Let's go.

02:28:29.821 --> 02:28:31.364
You think you bad, huh?

02:28:35.828 --> 02:28:38.498
Hold on. Where you going?
Where you going?

02:28:38.623 --> 02:28:39.792
Come on!

02:28:41.794 --> 02:28:43.128
I'll get it!

02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:46.840
Where's Tim?

02:28:47.842 --> 02:28:49.219
Quiet, kid!

02:28:55.893 --> 02:28:58.646
I got some sandwiches for you boys, man.

02:29:00.564 --> 02:29:02.191
But where's Tim?

02:29:02.316 --> 02:29:04.820
Shit. Man, Tim always playing around.

02:29:06.238 --> 02:29:07.489
Hey, man!

02:29:07.823 --> 02:29:09.699
You got some Blue Magic, baby?

02:29:11.159 --> 02:29:12.620
Fucking junkie!

02:29:13.496 --> 02:29:14.872
Yo, handle that!

02:29:15.039 --> 02:29:16.499
I'm sick! Come on! I got money, man!

02:29:16.666 --> 02:29:18.459
Come on, man, you know me, baby!

02:29:18.626 --> 02:29:21.380
Come on!
Come on, I need that Blue Magic, man.

02:29:21.505 --> 02:29:22.881
It's me, Boogaloo, baby.

02:29:23.048 --> 02:29:26.135
Hey, man, you know I got
your god damn money. Come on, man.

02:29:26.260 --> 02:29:28.388
- And one, two, three!
Fucking junkie.

02:29:30.223 --> 02:29:32.100
Police! Police!

02:29:32.267 --> 02:29:33.977
- Drop it!
Get out, get out!

02:29:34.102 --> 02:29:35.186
- Drop the gun!
- Don't do it!

02:29:35.311 --> 02:29:37.273
- Drop the gun, drop it!
- Don't do it.

02:29:39.525 --> 02:29:40.818
Scotty!

02:29:44.197 --> 02:29:45.741
Police! Everybody down!

02:29:48.201 --> 02:29:49.369
You motherfucker!

02:29:52.498 --> 02:29:54.542
Police! Nobody move!
- Look out!

02:30:02.718 --> 02:30:04.595
Don't fucking move!

02:30:14.564 --> 02:30:15.113
I want to see your hands!
All the hands!

02:30:15.148 --> 02:30:17.109
I want to see your hands!
All the hands!

02:30:17.234 --> 02:30:18.235
Police!

02:30:21.864 --> 02:30:23.991
Down! Down! Get down!

02:30:24.116 --> 02:30:25.827
Stay the fuck down!

02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:19.929
Hey, man, what's going on?

02:31:25.185 --> 02:31:26.645
What the hell...

02:31:39.160 --> 02:31:41.454
Stay down! Down, motherfucker! Stay down!

02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:43.164
Hands! Hands!

02:31:48.086 --> 02:31:49.796
Out at home, baby.

02:32:01.017 --> 02:32:03.312
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:05.981
Y'all wait right here. Wait right here.

02:32:30.634 --> 02:32:33.220
- Mrs Lucas, please step back inside.
- Yes, Officer.

02:32:33.386 --> 02:32:34.639
Please, Mother Lucas, step inside, please.

02:32:34.806 --> 02:32:38.142
Respectfully, ma'am, please step inside.
Thank you. Step inside.

02:32:49.488 --> 02:32:51.866
Hands up against the wall. Stay back.

02:32:54.244 --> 02:32:55.578
Oh, man.

02:32:55.703 --> 02:32:58.415
Don't you owe me money?
I'll get you some more. Here you go.

02:33:00.251 --> 02:33:02.294
Yo, yo! Pigs! Look out!

02:33:02.461 --> 02:33:04.505
NYPD! Everybody stand still!

02:33:07.592 --> 02:33:09.136
Turner! Go!

02:33:10.637 --> 02:33:12.681
Down on the ground, motherfucker!

02:33:46.845 --> 02:33:51.475
...dead servicemen returning
from defending our country in Vietnam...

02:33:54.019 --> 02:33:56.939
Over there. Okay.

02:34:02.529 --> 02:34:05.449
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this stage of the proceedings

02:34:05.616 --> 02:34:08.869
the counsels are ready
for their opening statements.

02:34:09.036 --> 02:34:12.040
For the prosecution,
Mr Roberts will proceed

02:34:12.207 --> 02:34:14.417
with his opening statement first.

02:34:14.959 --> 02:34:18.798
Mr Roberts, are you ready to proceed?

02:34:20.591 --> 02:34:22.218
Yes, Your Honour.

02:34:26.138 --> 02:34:28.642
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

02:34:33.063 --> 02:34:36.901
the State will show and you will hear

02:34:37.068 --> 02:34:40.905
that Frank Lucas is the most dangerous man

02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:43.242
walking the streets of our city.

02:34:46.036 --> 02:34:49.957
All right, y'all, get on out.
Let me talk to Mr Richie alone.

02:34:53.044 --> 02:34:57.257
Come on, come on, come on.
I pay y'all by the hour, not by the minute.

02:34:59.260 --> 02:35:00.553
Thank you.

02:35:05.391 --> 02:35:07.769
You ain't wearing a wire, are you?

02:35:08.436 --> 02:35:09.729
No.

02:35:10.522 --> 02:35:13.442
All right. I was talking to my lawyers.

02:35:13.567 --> 02:35:16.487
They said something to me,
I can't believe it.

02:35:17.447 --> 02:35:20.616
Did you really find a million dollars
in the trunk of a car

02:35:20.783 --> 02:35:22.493
- and then turn it in? Did you do that?
- Yeah.

02:35:22.618 --> 02:35:23.996
You did that for real, huh?

02:35:24.121 --> 02:35:27.458
My man. Good for you. Shit.

02:35:27.624 --> 02:35:29.668
You know Johnny Law got it though, right?

02:35:29.793 --> 02:35:31.754
- Maybe.
- Ain't no maybe about it, Mr Richie.

02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:34.090
You know he got it.
You turned that money in,

02:35:34.215 --> 02:35:36.885
he took it and you ain't get nothing for it.
Did you?

02:35:37.010 --> 02:35:38.720
Why did you do that?

02:35:38.845 --> 02:35:41.599
- It was the right thing to do.
- That's true.

02:35:41.765 --> 02:35:43.392
That's a good answer.
It was the right thing to do.

02:35:43.559 --> 02:35:45.686
The question I have,
the question I've been asking myself is,

02:35:45.853 --> 02:35:47.647
would you do it again?

02:35:48.732 --> 02:35:51.902
I mean, that's a lot of money,
that's a long time ago.

02:35:52.068 --> 02:35:55.573
Many car payments ago,
many child support payments ago.

02:35:57.366 --> 02:36:01.204
So I said to myself,
the onlyest way to find out is to find out.

02:36:02.747 --> 02:36:08.504
Bribery, extortion, murder,
racketeering...

02:36:10.589 --> 02:36:12.217
Now, you give me an address,

02:36:12.342 --> 02:36:15.762
I'll make sure the car's there,
I'll make sure that money's in that trunk.

02:36:15.929 --> 02:36:17.388
No, thanks.

02:36:17.514 --> 02:36:18.807
You sure?

02:36:20.684 --> 02:36:23.521
Come on, now, Richie.
What do you think, that impresses me?

02:36:23.687 --> 02:36:26.398
You think that you're better than them?
You ain't no better than them other cops.

02:36:26.524 --> 02:36:29.861
In fact, you're the same as them.
You are them.

02:36:30.028 --> 02:36:31.029
Let me ask you this.

02:36:31.196 --> 02:36:34.366
Do you really think that
putting me behind bars

02:36:34.533 --> 02:36:36.327
is going to change anything
on them streets?

02:36:36.452 --> 02:36:37.912
Them dope fiends is gonna shoot it,

02:36:38.037 --> 02:36:40.248
they're gonna steal for it,
they're gonna die for it.

02:36:40.414 --> 02:36:43.501
Putting me in or out
ain't gonna change one thing.

02:36:43.626 --> 02:36:44.795
Then that's the way it is.

02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:46.964
That's just the way it is.
So what we got, Richie?

02:36:47.089 --> 02:36:49.299
We got me and you sitting here.

02:36:49.466 --> 02:36:51.928
We got that little snitch-ass driver
for my brother:

02:36:52.053 --> 02:36:53.930
You got a little bit of powder:

02:36:54.055 --> 02:36:55.765
You're going to need more than that, Richie:

02:36:55.932 --> 02:36:59.435
I got possession, supply,
conspiracy,

02:36:59.644 --> 02:37:03.691
bribing a law officer: I got people who'll
attest to seeing you kill in cold blood:

02:37:03.858 --> 02:37:07.778
I got your offshore bank accounts,
your real estate, your businesses,

02:37:07.903 --> 02:37:10.824
all bought with money from heroin.

02:37:10.949 --> 02:37:13.785
And I got hundreds of parents of dead kids.

02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:16.372
Addicts who OD'ed on your product.
And that's my story for the jury.

02:37:16.497 --> 02:37:20.168
And that's how I make it all stick.
"This man murdered thousands of people.

02:37:20.293 --> 02:37:22.170
"And he did it from a penthouse,
driving a Lincoln."

02:37:22.295 --> 02:37:24.005
Aside from that,
you got nothing to worry about.

02:37:24.173 --> 02:37:27.009
That's pretty good. But that's why
we go to court, isn't it, Richie?

02:37:27.134 --> 02:37:28.677
'Cause I got witnesses, too.

02:37:28.802 --> 02:37:32.724
I got celebrities.
I got sports figures. I got Harlem, Richie.

02:37:33.308 --> 02:37:37.061
I took care of Harlem, so Harlem's
gonna take care of me. You can believe that.

02:37:37.228 --> 02:37:39.689
- I got more than that, Frank.
- What you got?

02:37:39.814 --> 02:37:42.485
I've got a line of people
wanting to testify against you,

02:37:42.610 --> 02:37:44.904
it stretches out the door
and around the block.

02:37:45.070 --> 02:37:48.825
You damaged a lot of lives, Frank:
I got the Mazzano crime family:

02:37:48.992 --> 02:37:50.535
Remember those boys?
You put them out of business:

02:37:50.702 --> 02:37:52.078
I ain't got nothing to do with no Mazzanos.

02:37:52.204 --> 02:37:53.371
Mazzanos ain't got nothing to do with me.

02:37:53.538 --> 02:37:54.915
- They got everything to do with you.
- What, they...

02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:56.124
- You know why?
- Why?

02:37:56.291 --> 02:37:59.212
Because apart from the fact
that they hate you personally,

02:37:59.378 --> 02:38:00.546
they hate what you represent.

02:38:00.713 --> 02:38:04.217
- I don't represent nothing but Frank Lucas.
- You sure?

02:38:04.383 --> 02:38:06.428
A black businessman like you?

02:38:06.553 --> 02:38:08.680
You represent progress.

02:38:08.847 --> 02:38:12.267
The kind of progress
that's going to see them lose a lot of money.

02:38:12.392 --> 02:38:15.897
With you out of the way,
everything can return to normal.

02:38:17.106 --> 02:38:18.274
My man.

02:38:23.155 --> 02:38:25.449
You know what normal is to me, Richie?

02:38:25.574 --> 02:38:28.577
I ain't seen normal since I was six years old.

02:38:29.996 --> 02:38:32.541
Normal is seeing the police
right up to my house

02:38:32.707 --> 02:38:35.627
dragging my little 12-year-old cousin out,
tying him to a pole,

02:38:35.752 --> 02:38:38.840
shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.

02:38:39.006 --> 02:38:42.260
Then they bust two shotgun shells
in his head and knock his fucking head off.

02:38:42.385 --> 02:38:43.553
That's what normal is to me.

02:38:43.719 --> 02:38:46.723
I didn't give a fuck about no police then.

02:38:46.890 --> 02:38:49.810
I don't give a fuck about
no police now. Shit.

02:38:50.227 --> 02:38:52.437
You know what,
you can do whatever you want to do.

02:38:52.604 --> 02:38:55.066
So, it don't mean nothing to me
for you to show up tomorrow morning

02:38:55.233 --> 02:38:58.069
with your head blown off.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

02:38:58.236 --> 02:39:03.576
Yeah, Frank. Get in line.
That one stretches around the block, too.

02:39:06.996 --> 02:39:08.330
All right.

02:39:12.169 --> 02:39:13.545
What do you want to do?

02:39:20.178 --> 02:39:21.804
You know what you got to do.

02:39:21.929 --> 02:39:23.639
What do you want me to do? Snitch, huh?

02:39:23.806 --> 02:39:25.267
I know you don't want me
to give up no cops.

02:39:25.392 --> 02:39:27.436
What do you want? You want gangsters?

02:39:27.561 --> 02:39:31.315
Pick one. Jew gangsters?
Mick gangsters? Guineas?

02:39:31.815 --> 02:39:34.527
They've been bleeding Harlem dry
since they got off the boat, Richie.

02:39:34.652 --> 02:39:38.406
I don't give a fuck about no crime figures.
You can have them.

02:39:39.532 --> 02:39:41.075
I'll take them, too.

02:39:41.242 --> 02:39:43.120
You'll take them, too?

02:39:48.292 --> 02:39:51.963
No, you didn't. You're talking about police.
You want police?

02:39:52.589 --> 02:39:53.590
You want your own kind?

02:39:53.715 --> 02:39:55.592
They're not my kind.

02:39:55.759 --> 02:39:58.429
They're in business with you, Frank.
They ain't my kind.

02:39:58.554 --> 02:40:02.391
They ain't my kind
like the Italians are not yours. All right?

02:40:05.729 --> 02:40:06.730
Huh.

02:40:16.074 --> 02:40:18.451
What can you promise me, Richie?

02:40:21.454 --> 02:40:24.875
I can promise you, you lie about one name,

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.877
you'll never get out of prison.

02:40:27.002 --> 02:40:29.672
You lie about one dollar,
in one offshore account,

02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:32.050
you'll never get out of prison.

02:40:33.218 --> 02:40:37.430
Now you can live life rich in jail
for the rest of your born days,

02:40:37.974 --> 02:40:40.518
or be poor outside for some of them.

02:40:41.519 --> 02:40:43.813
That's what I can promise you.

02:40:46.692 --> 02:40:52.781
I want them cops, Richie.
That's what I want, I want them cops

02:40:54.159 --> 02:40:57.328
that took that money out of my pockets.

02:41:00.123 --> 02:41:01.666
Him, too.

02:41:01.791 --> 02:41:03.669
All right. Okay.

02:41:05.546 --> 02:41:07.756
Hey, Spearman? Spearman.

02:41:08.465 --> 02:41:11.011
So these guys are all connected up
to Gywnn, all right.

02:41:11.178 --> 02:41:13.722
See this guy here, he's in uniform...

02:41:14.639 --> 02:41:16.850
Four police officers were arrested today

02:41:17.017 --> 02:41:19.478
on charges of taking bribes
from drug traffickers:

02:41:19.687 --> 02:41:20.855
Well done, Jimmy.

02:41:20.980 --> 02:41:23.107
The investigation into police corruption

02:41:23.232 --> 02:41:26.320
has swept through New York's
drug enforcement ranks

02:41:26.487 --> 02:41:29.823
broadened today with
the arrest of 19 more officers:

02:41:30.908 --> 02:41:34.579
In what is being called
this city's largest police corruption scandal,

02:41:34.746 --> 02:41:38.875
32 more officers were indicted
today in federal court on bribery charges:

02:41:39.042 --> 02:41:42.128
These police officers
will face stiff prison terms,

02:41:42.338 --> 02:41:45.174
say federal prosecutors, if found guilty:

02:41:45.341 --> 02:41:47.801
A report
by federal investigators into New York's

02:41:47.927 --> 02:41:49.970
ever widening police corruption scandal

02:41:50.137 --> 02:41:52.682
claims that more than
half of the city's officers

02:41:52.891 --> 02:41:57.020
assigned to drug enforcement
have engaged in some form of corruption:

02:41:58.063 --> 02:42:01.317
Allegations of widespread corruption within

02:42:01.484 --> 02:42:03.861
the elite narcotics squad SIU

02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:07.491
have led to the arrest of
more New York City detectives:

02:42:07.783 --> 02:42:09.034
Convicted of extortion,

02:42:09.201 --> 02:42:12.371
members of New York City's
Special Investigations Narcotics Unit

02:42:12.579 --> 02:42:15.583
will face sentencing today in federal court:

02:42:17.544 --> 02:42:20.380
MacNamara. Vendazzo.

02:42:21.631 --> 02:42:22.883
Trupo.

02:42:26.262 --> 02:42:27.638
You are special.

02:43:11.146 --> 02:43:13.023
It's good work, Frank.

02:43:14.274 --> 02:43:15.650
You know...

02:43:15.859 --> 02:43:19.447
You don't want a drink or something?
Celebrate?

02:43:20.072 --> 02:43:21.949
You got any holy water?

02:44:16.594 --> 02:44:19.264
Check your property. Sign, please.

02:45:11.197 --> 02:45:14.534
Smell better out here?

02:45:32.971 --> 02:45:35.432
Frank. There you are.

02:45:36.266 --> 02:45:38.728
- Caffe latte. Yeah.
- Latte?

02:45:38.895 --> 02:45:41.731
- Oh, shit. Yeah.
- You all right?

02:45:41.940 --> 02:45:44.818
That's a fancy way of saying
coffee with milk.

02:45:44.985 --> 02:45:46.320
- Yeah.
- $2.50.

02:45:49.865 --> 02:45:52.243
So you been talking to your brothers?

02:45:52.409 --> 02:45:55.747
No, no, I ain't talked to them in years.
It's probably best for them.

02:45:59.751 --> 02:46:04.131
What the hell am I going to do out here,
Richie? I don't know how I'm gonna live.

02:46:06.425 --> 02:46:09.429
Hey, I told ya, I ain't gonna let you starve,
all right?

02:46:09.596 --> 02:46:11.014
Obviously, you ain't starving.

02:46:12.307 --> 02:46:15.310
Bagels and blinches. They will catch up
with you, you know?

02:46:19.566 --> 02:46:20.567
Who's this?

02:46:21.276 --> 02:46:23.987
Expensive sneakers. About $100 a pair.

02:46:33.415 --> 02:46:35.292
Frederick Douglass Boulevard.

02:46:36.626 --> 02:46:40.046
This used to be Eighth Avenue, why do they
call it Frederick Douglass Boulevard now?

02:46:45.845 --> 02:46:48.848
This was me Richie, right here.
This was all me.

02:46:50.392 --> 02:46:52.519
In my day there were so many niggers
out here buying dope

02:46:52.644 --> 02:46:55.314
you could've made a Tarzan movie.

02:46:56.064 --> 02:46:59.569
You know, one phone call, I'll be right back
in business, you know that.

02:46:59.694 --> 02:47:03.031
You don't do that, Frank.
These days I keep all my promises.

02:47:14.252 --> 02:47:16.546
Why'd you come and get me, huh?

02:47:16.713 --> 02:47:18.590
You're a superstar, Frank.

02:47:18.757 --> 02:47:19.925
A superstar?

02:47:21.176 --> 02:47:25.223
Your evidence alone
gave me 150 convictions.

02:47:25.723 --> 02:47:28.726
Thought the least we could do
is give you a ride home.

02:47:29.143 --> 02:47:32.981
Yeah, you sure did that.
You gave me a ride home. Free ride.

02:47:33.523 --> 02:47:35.901
Coming to gangsters.

02:47:39.697 --> 02:47:40.698
What?

02:47:43.159 --> 02:47:46.080
Ain't nothin', man. Ain't nothin', man.

02:47:46.914 --> 02:47:49.041
That's life right there. That's life right there.

02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:52.670
Even a fool gets to be young once.
