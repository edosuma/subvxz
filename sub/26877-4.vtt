[carolers singing
"Canto Para Pedir Posada"]

00:29.612 --> 00:31.156
[in Spanish]
I like to go out jogging.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.658
Try and mix in weights when I can.

00:36.661 --> 00:37.579
You?

00:39.456 --> 00:42.292
Do I... exercise?

00:42.375 --> 00:43.376
Mm-hmm.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.504
Uh...

00:46.588 --> 00:48.214
-[Sofia] Oh, Rafa!
-[grunts]

00:48.298 --> 00:49.883
[panting] Yeah!

00:52.218 --> 00:54.262
It's all been cardio, I suppose.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.765
Me too.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.940
[dogs barking]

01:08.234 --> 01:09.486
[grunts]

01:33.551 --> 01:35.386
[chattering]

01:44.229 --> 01:45.063
[gunshot]

01:45.146 --> 01:46.773
[Cuco] On the floor, motherfuckers!

01:46.856 --> 01:49.359
-On the floor! Are you deaf?
-[Rafa] Head down!

01:49.692 --> 01:50.527
[Cuco] Get down!

01:51.277 --> 01:53.196
You have no idea who you're fucking with.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.364
Do you know who I am?

01:54.447 --> 01:56.741
An old man who can't sing for shit.

01:56.825 --> 02:00.578
Get on the ground, motherfucker!
Let the ruling class tremble!

02:00.662 --> 02:03.081
Long live... the prole...

02:03.164 --> 02:04.874
-The prole--
-Long live the Revolution!

02:04.958 --> 02:06.751

[cocks gun]

02:22.100 --> 02:24.727
[panting]

02:30.275 --> 02:31.484
-Stand up.
-No.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.403
No! No!

02:33.486 --> 02:35.738
-Shut up or I'll kill you!
-Sofia! No!

02:35.822 --> 02:38.908
-No, please don't take her.
-[Sofia] Dad!

02:39.325 --> 02:41.452
-Mom!
-[man] Don't take her! Please!

02:41.536 --> 02:44.622
Sofia! Please don't take her!
Don't take her!

02:44.706 --> 02:45.790
Sofia!

02:46.166 --> 02:48.001
-Don't take her! Please! Sofía!
-Sofia! No!

02:48.084 --> 02:48.918
[Sofia screams]

02:49.544 --> 02:51.337
Open, asshole!

02:51.421 --> 02:52.797
-Sofia!
-Dad!

02:53.214 --> 02:54.174
Sofia!

02:56.217 --> 02:59.804
It's "proletariat," stupid. And you were
supposed to kick over the Christmas tree.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.016
-Okay, but we didn't do that bad.
-No, Rafa, you were wonderful.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.019
[Sofia] It's so romantic!

03:08.479 --> 03:10.940
[Rodrigo Amarante's "Tuyo" playing]

04:38.695 --> 04:40.530
[narrator] Have you ever met a guy
like this?

04:40.947 --> 04:45.201
Has everything under control,
not a single hair out of place?

04:45.285 --> 04:49.080
That was Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo.
"The Thin Man."

04:49.664 --> 04:51.708
Drug kingpin of Guadalajara.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.793
DEA wanted to know everything about him,

04:53.876 --> 04:56.462
right down to what side
of the fucking bed he got up on.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.048
But this guy had everything locked down.

04:59.924 --> 05:04.345
Anytime they got close,
his DFS friends were there waiting.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.847
[Knapp] Watch out! Goddamn it!

05:05.930 --> 05:08.558
[horn honking]

05:08.641 --> 05:09.475
Shit!

05:09.559 --> 05:11.644
[narrator] Fucking with him
every step of the way.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.397
-Goddamn it.
-Both. This one too?

05:14.480 --> 05:17.483
-Yeah, fucking knives.
-[narrator] They took what they could get.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.319
[Knapp] Hold on. That's Rafa right there.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.904
[narrator] They couldn't
get near the big fish.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.573
[camera clicks]

05:23.656 --> 05:25.742
So they targeted the small ones.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.036
[camera clicks]

05:28.119 --> 05:30.455
[in Spanish] Not until later, darling.
Not until later.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.498
[narrator] They worked him...

05:33.416 --> 05:38.212
and gradually started getting
a better picture of the empire he'd built.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.630
Here's what they did know.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.592
Félix had partnered with the DFS
and plaza bosses.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.802
And using his massive supply
of marijuana,

05:44.886 --> 05:48.681
he was able to control the market and fix
the price of weed across North America.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.892
Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo

05:50.975 --> 05:54.020
had singlehandedly built
a confederation of drug traffickers.

05:54.103 --> 05:58.941
The first Mexican drug cartel.
But that's a lot to get your head around.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.152
Especially when drinking the water
in Mexico City.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.196
The Rockefeller of marijuana.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.156
Pretty much.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.742
Why not just hit this field
and cut off his supply?

06:07.825 --> 06:10.244
We can't get back to it, sir.
Félix covers his tracks.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.039
The eradication program
should be able to find it.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.792
Yeah, they think Félix
has gotten to that, too.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.961
We feel our best bet
is to go straight at Félix, sir,

06:19.045 --> 06:20.630
cut the head off the snake.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.258
Of course, it's a challenge when the men
who are supposed to be our partners

06:24.342 --> 06:25.968
are working against us.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.597
We need some real support
from Mexico City, sir.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.516
Enough pressure from you...

06:32.392 --> 06:33.726
we just might get it.

06:34.769 --> 06:35.978
What do you think, Heath?

06:37.271 --> 06:40.525
I think the Mexican drug business
is as organized as my wife's checkbook.

06:41.442 --> 06:46.114
The fact is, drug violence is down,
seizures are up.

06:46.197 --> 06:49.575
-That's because the business is organized.
-How's that?

06:49.659 --> 06:52.120
Well, the more money you have,
the more cops you can own,

06:52.203 --> 06:54.622
the more you can inflate the numbers.
It's a joke.

06:54.705 --> 06:58.167
All right. Sir, numbers aside,
there is a real opportunity here.

06:58.376 --> 07:01.754
We take out Félix,
we cripple the Mexican drug trade.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.973
[Gavin] Numbers matter, Jaime.

07:14.642 --> 07:18.688
And if this is what a cartel looks like,
I can live with that.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.820
[narrator] So how do you take down a crook
who's at the top of his game?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.614
Who has every cop in town in his pocket?

07:30.741 --> 07:33.953
Well... you hold your breath

07:34.036 --> 07:36.205
and you hope you get lucky.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.415
[in Spanish] We need to talk.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.877
They're coming for Rafa.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.171
Open, asshole! Sofia!

07:43.254 --> 07:47.341
[narrator] Remember this guy? Well,
turns out he's the Minister of Education

07:47.425 --> 07:51.304
and a senior member of the most powerful
political party in Mexico.

07:51.387 --> 07:55.683
For 50 years, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI,

07:55.766 --> 07:59.312
controlled the presidency of Mexico
and never lost a senate seat.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.147
Wonder how they managed that.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.316
Félix knew if he didn't give them
what they wanted,

08:03.399 --> 08:05.693
they'd rip his business down to the studs

08:05.776 --> 08:08.738
and he'd back
to scraping pennies together in Sinaloa.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.240
[in Spanish] Rafa fucked up.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.452
He screwed with the order of things.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.748
These assholes sit above us all.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.839
I'm taking you to the hotel.

08:27.715 --> 08:28.966
You and the kids.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.178
You'll be safer there.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.139
And Rafa?

08:37.225 --> 08:38.392
Are you gonna answer me?

08:44.190 --> 08:45.399
Wha-- What!?

08:45.775 --> 08:47.235
What do you want me to tell you?

08:48.986 --> 08:50.780
I have a business to protect.

08:52.156 --> 08:54.659
I stand in their way,
and they'll make us disappear.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.832
The narco who thinks
he's a businessman...

09:02.667 --> 09:04.502
is a narco about to get fucked.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.420
No doubt something your father said.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.214
He was a man of few words.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.759
So what? Those days are over!

09:12.718 --> 09:14.178
This isn't the ranch anymore.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.976
We can't just grab our shit and...
head for the hills and vanish.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.852
Then remember why we left there.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.107
You can't trust those motherfuckers.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.193
You can't turn Rafa in, Miguel.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.200
I don't know.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.919
You can take care
of your business, Miguel.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.506
But also protect your family.

09:52.091 --> 09:56.846
[instrumental music plays]

09:57.805 --> 09:59.307
[Kiki in English] Look at this guy.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.851
[doorbell rings]

10:03.019 --> 10:04.270
[Kikito] I'll get it.

10:04.729 --> 10:05.980
[Mika] I'll take him.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.940
Hi. Hey.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.442
Hi, my little dancer.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.822
-Oh.
-Hey.

10:15.239 --> 10:17.533
Well, it happened. Thin Man fucked up.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.827
[Kiki] The hell was this guy thinking?

10:19.910 --> 10:23.289
All that matters is Rafa has
crossed hombres that you do not cross.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.499
He's about to get caught
in a PRI shitstorm.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.376
Best way to catch the smart ones?

10:28.377 --> 10:30.004
Get an idiot working for 'em.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.506
So Rafa rolls, gives us Félix.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.093
Just gotta get it done before
the PRI genie goes back in the bottle.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.262
Or Rafa gets the fuck out of Dodge.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.973
-[Pedro Infante's "El Mil Amores" playing]
-[yelps]

10:42.058 --> 10:43.017
[Rafa in Spanish] Shit!

10:47.104 --> 10:48.105
[yells]

10:48.522 --> 10:50.149
No! Bonnie!

10:54.070 --> 10:57.281
Now, you sons of bitches,
this is a fucking stickup.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.950
You don't wanna give us the money?

11:00.076 --> 11:02.328
Then eat lead, motherfuckers!

11:05.247 --> 11:07.708
[giggles]

11:08.626 --> 11:09.877
[coughs]

11:11.003 --> 11:12.630
We should rob a bank.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.799
They're mine.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.717
All the more reason.

11:22.431 --> 11:23.766
You make a good Bonnie.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.352
Why do you always get to be the badass?

11:27.144 --> 11:30.606
Because Bonnie was the heart,
and Clyde the brains.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.858
And Clyde was always on top.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.404
And I'm the badass.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.863
[footsteps approaching]

11:38.948 --> 11:39.824
Rafa.

11:40.991 --> 11:41.951
Rafa!

11:44.203 --> 11:46.831
-What the fuck do you want?
-[Cuco] Félix is outside.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.876
You realize what you've done?

11:51.627 --> 11:54.296
All right, man. There's no problem.

11:54.672 --> 11:55.840
No problem?

11:56.257 --> 11:57.091
None?

12:02.054 --> 12:03.389
It was just a joke.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.392
The family wants you dead, Rafa.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.018
And they're in the PRI.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.772
I'll bring her home tomorrow,
and it'll blow over.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.359
You're turning yourself in.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.153
No fucking way. Why?

12:18.320 --> 12:22.324
They're sending men from Mexico City
to put a bullet in your head, Rafa.

12:23.617 --> 12:27.538
They're going to tear the business apart
looking for you. Everything I've built.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.334
Oh, so you invented sinsemilla now?

12:33.878 --> 12:36.338
You don't fucking get it, Rafa.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.424
We finally got all we wanted.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.177
And you're thinking with your dick?

12:43.387 --> 12:44.972
I turn myself in, then what?

12:59.278 --> 13:00.613
It's just this girl...

13:04.200 --> 13:05.159
Damn!

13:06.786 --> 13:08.037
I thought that...

13:08.913 --> 13:11.290
nothing would ever get me away
from that field.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.212
But it's okay.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.590
I'm going to turn myself in.
Take me in, man.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.676
But it can't be like last time.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.472
And no fucking way I'm writing you
from prison, asshole.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.974
[chuckles]

13:31.060 --> 13:32.353
Go say goodbye.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.490
And pack a bag.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.578
You're not turning me in?

13:50.788 --> 13:53.290
Now! Before I change my mind.

13:58.546 --> 13:59.964
[Félix]
This motherfucker.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.800
[narrator] Contrary to what
you may have heard,

14:02.883 --> 14:06.887
when the Mexican government puts
its mind to something, it gets it done.

14:06.971 --> 14:11.267
Remember the Alamo?
When they come, they come hard.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.394
And by the way they responded to this,

14:13.477 --> 14:16.772
it was looking like Félix's problem
was DEA's opportunity.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.985
Within 24 hours of Rafa
waving a gun in a minister's face,

14:21.068 --> 14:22.695
they put up roadblocks everywhere,

14:22.778 --> 14:25.656
and sent their big game hunter
from Mexico City.

14:25.739 --> 14:29.410
This was the man the locals
called the Eliot Ness of Mexico.

14:29.493 --> 14:32.371
Subcomandante
Guillermo González Calderoni.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.415
Rafael Caro Quintero.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.542
[in Spanish] Our target.

14:37.501 --> 14:39.169
Business associate
of many of the Sinaloans

14:39.253 --> 14:40.504
who've relocated to this area.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.630
Gentlemen...

14:42.840 --> 14:44.133
let me make this clear.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.677
Caro's going down.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.263
This comes from the top.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.641
We've got a perimeter around the city.

14:52.933 --> 14:56.812
Your captains have their orders.
Now get off your asses and get to work.

15:01.275 --> 15:04.445
Commander,
we're from the DEA in Guadalajara.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.197
We're here to offer our assistance.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.700
[in English] Don't sweat it.
I speak real good English.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.869
We have information on Rafa.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.747
My local offices are familiar
with Mr. Caro Quintero.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.958
All due respect, Comandante,
the only contact your men have with him

15:18.042 --> 15:19.585
is pretending to seize his weed.

15:19.668 --> 15:23.339
Which will not be helpful with Mexico City
breathing down your neck for him.

15:23.422 --> 15:27.843
Sir, we've been following him for a while.
Him, his associates, his residences.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.679
Even the big ugly four-by-four
that he rolls around town in.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.354
Get your gear. We leave in 20.

15:40.898 --> 15:41.899
Let's go.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.917
-[man in Spanish] Mr. Félix.
-I don't have time right now.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.882
-[Nava] Who is after... how is it?
-[Abril laughing]

16:06.966 --> 16:08.217
[Nava] Doña Blanca.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.635
Very good!

16:09.718 --> 16:12.179
I'm that little bee that's after...

16:14.723 --> 16:16.433
This girl is very smart.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.477
Daddy's home.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.064
The one person I don't see... is Rafa.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.318
Yeah. We couldn't find him.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.116
It's your funeral.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.702
Abril, let your father speak with the man.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.538
Come. Let's go find your brother.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.249
Must be playing around.

16:41.583 --> 16:42.960
Bye, precious.

16:43.043 --> 16:44.378
[Abril] Bye.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.092
Cute family.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.305
So, how do we fix this?

16:55.848 --> 16:59.059
-"We"?
-Yes, this is also your mess.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.561
Besides, I pay you.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.230
Yes, but...

17:04.148 --> 17:06.275
we all answer to someone.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.152
At least I...

17:09.695 --> 17:11.613
I know who I answer to.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.076
You know what?

17:17.286 --> 17:19.705
Tell your boss I'll do him that favor.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.958
I'll arrange the planes,
coordinate everything.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.503
I thought favors were beneath you?

17:27.421 --> 17:29.465
[scoffs]

17:29.548 --> 17:32.509
Well, tell him to accept it
as a friendly gesture.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.387
To call off the search.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.182
He's Secretary of Defense.

17:38.265 --> 17:41.435
[chuckles]
I don't tell him shit.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.899
Okay, but... he listens to you.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.651
You can make a recommendation.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.571
Yes, but running an errand
with one of your planes,

17:52.654 --> 17:55.240
and kidnapped daughters? Well...

17:56.075 --> 17:57.618
they're not worth the same.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.791
Let's do something, okay?

18:08.545 --> 18:09.922
I'll make the call.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.592
But you'll oversee the mission yourself.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.012
-Why?
-Think of it as...

18:17.846 --> 18:19.431
quality control.

18:21.266 --> 18:25.270
-That wasn't the deal.
-Yes, but circumstances have changed.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.607
And they leave Rafa alone?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.317
Who knows?

18:31.819 --> 18:33.904
But they'll kill him if you don't.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.406
That I'll guarantee.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.413
I'd get moving if I were you.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.458
Thanks for the drink.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.597
[Kiki] Those warrants came through fast.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.517
I guess everybody wants justice now, huh?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.938
What, are you some fucking pocho cop
can't believe how shit works here?

19:08.021 --> 19:12.401
I thought I knew... until I got down here
and saw how fucked up it is.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.986
[in Spanish]
And don't call me pocho.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.362
Hmm.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.614
[in English] Things are
more complicated than you think.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.160
But if you know how to play it,
you can still do good work.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.495
That sounds like a bunch of excuses.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.625
Do you know why we call a bribe
"una mordida," Agent Camarena?

19:29.626 --> 19:31.170
Because they want to take a bite?

19:34.756 --> 19:36.884
Because everybody's got to eat.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.446

20:17.132 --> 20:19.009
[in English]
Doesn't hurt to send a message.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.180
Yeah, subtle.

20:24.932 --> 20:28.268
We hit every fucking address
you gave us, Agent Camarena.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.354
All of Rafa's houses.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.191
Nothing.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.486
We've got fuck all.
You better hope he's still in the city.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.156
I have a CI. Javier Contreras.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.951
Yeah, he hangs out
with one of Rafa's gunmen.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.453
Let's go have a talk with Mr. Contreras.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.000
[in Spanish] This shit is cool.

20:52.834 --> 20:56.630
-You flown this type of plane before?
-No, but it's like girls.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.841
Doesn't matter the size,
they all move the same.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.222
What's the cargo we're moving?

21:06.848 --> 21:08.058
Who knows?

21:10.811 --> 21:12.562
Well, where are we taking it?

21:13.146 --> 21:14.898
Once we get there, they'll tell us.

21:14.982 --> 21:18.277
And Nava will be waiting
for our call after we deliver.

21:24.491 --> 21:28.328
Brother, if Rafa fucked up
as bad as you say...

21:29.413 --> 21:33.208
have you considered this is Nava's way
of taking the whole thing for himself?

21:49.933 --> 21:51.310
[in Spanish] What the hell is this?

21:51.393 --> 21:55.522
[Don Neto] This is called laying low,
motherfucker, and you're gonna do it.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.234
Bring those.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.207
[Don Neto grunts]

22:16.335 --> 22:17.586
Welcome.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.465
[Rafa] What the fuck?

22:21.965 --> 22:23.050
Looks like a book store.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.886
[Don Neto] Félix wanted
the biggest house in town.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.804
But there's hardly any furniture.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.515
Or Christmas decorations.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.059
Look.

22:33.852 --> 22:37.022
It would've been real easy for him
to toss you to the lions.

22:38.398 --> 22:41.610
-If it had been me--
-What? You would've given me up?

22:44.780 --> 22:47.366
I would've killed you with my own hands.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.579
[chuckles]

22:53.955 --> 22:54.998
Sit down.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.172
We're not gonna call anyone.
Especially the girl.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.385
We're gonna keep quiet and out of sight.
Got it?

23:09.721 --> 23:12.557
And pray St. Miguelito
saves you from this one.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.354
It's all yours.

23:22.692 --> 23:23.735

23:27.656 --> 23:29.241
Fucking prick.

23:34.996 --> 23:37.207
Hey, man. Where's your commander?

23:43.463 --> 23:44.631
Shit!

23:50.178 --> 23:51.721
[in English] You the drug dealer?

23:51.805 --> 23:53.390
[Félix] Huh?

23:54.057 --> 23:56.309
[laughs]

23:56.393 --> 23:57.853
You ain't the enemy, man.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.312
Amen to that, right?

23:59.396 --> 24:02.899
All right, ándale, boys!
Let's deliver some freedom.

-[man in Spanish] Fast!

-[Amado] Fuck.
-[man] Let's go!

-Hey!

24:33.680 --> 24:37.392
Let me introduce you to Jorge.
He works with me at the DEA.

24:38.226 --> 24:39.561

Ooh.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.537
It's your lucky day!

Bring me another round, sweetheart.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.795
What do you want to know?

25:10.300 --> 25:12.219
Where is Rafa Caro Quintero?

25:17.974 --> 25:18.892
I don't know.

25:19.935 --> 25:24.314
Everything happened so fast...
no one saw where he went.

Look at me.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.646
[in English] What was that?

26:48.023 --> 26:50.942
It's police work.
That's how we do it down here.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.110
Hey, wait.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.487
I worked that kid for two months.

26:54.904 --> 26:56.364
Now I can't use him again.

that's your business.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.716

-And scare them off?

want her seeing some dipshit narco...

28:02.222 --> 28:04.140
My neighbor works for the phone company.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.977
Maybe he can trace the calls
going to the girl's house,

28:08.353 --> 28:11.481
and when Rafa checks in... we nail him.

28:12.899 --> 28:13.733
It could work.

But my neighbor's a civilian.

47:21.797 --> 47:24.550
Yeah, they're nose-hosing
a ton of that shit up north, amigo.

47:24.633 --> 47:25.968
Yeah.

47:26.051 --> 47:27.845
[sniffs] Hmm?

47:28.428 --> 47:30.264
Big money on the trot.

47:33.684 --> 47:35.561
Now I'm speaking your language.

48:11.555 --> 48:12.806
[Mika] What happened tonight?

48:16.935 --> 48:18.353
More bullshit.

48:24.359 --> 48:25.777
[Mika] You want to tell me about it?

48:34.119 --> 48:35.287
Can I help?

48:36.747 --> 48:38.165
Early Christmas present?

48:38.749 --> 48:40.375
[sighs]

48:45.213 --> 48:46.465
Kiki, look at me.

48:51.470 --> 48:52.429
I am.

48:54.181 --> 48:55.474
No, you're not.

49:01.188 --> 49:02.606
For the record, I tried, okay?

49:02.689 --> 49:06.485
[sighs] Okay.
Enjoy feeling sorry for yourself.

49:10.781 --> 49:12.324
Can you turn off the light, please?

49:43.563 --> 49:44.564
[elevator dings]

49:50.112 --> 49:51.947
[in Spanish] Home in one piece.

49:53.782 --> 49:55.075
What the fuck was that?

49:55.158 --> 49:57.077
Just a reminder.

49:57.703 --> 49:59.621
Of how things work.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.960
It was your idea to send me.

50:06.545 --> 50:09.006
If I remember correctly, it was yours.

50:12.467 --> 50:14.511
Just be glad it all worked out.

50:17.931 --> 50:19.141
And Félix...

50:20.809 --> 50:22.894
next time I ask you
to get on your knees...

50:23.520 --> 50:26.648
your only question is "For how long?"

50:35.824 --> 50:37.200
[Don Neto in Spanish]
Fucking Nava.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.327
We should kill him.

50:39.411 --> 50:41.038
Fuck what it costs us.

50:41.872 --> 50:43.373
It's not necessary, Neto.

50:44.499 --> 50:46.043
Fuck that guy.

50:48.420 --> 50:49.671
Forgive me, Miguel.

50:51.423 --> 50:52.424
Yeah.

50:55.510 --> 50:57.429
Enough, you pair of pussies.

50:58.096 --> 50:59.264
Anyone want a beer?

50:59.347 --> 51:02.601
It's 9:30 in the morning.

51:03.101 --> 51:04.978
Well, it's the best time to get started.

51:06.146 --> 51:09.649
-What happened to your eye?
-Don't worry about it.

51:09.733 --> 51:10.650
Let's have a toast.

51:11.359 --> 51:13.028
For the hits life throws our way.

51:13.570 --> 51:15.822
With time, they're
what make you stronger, young man.

51:16.239 --> 51:17.282
Let's go.

51:24.623 --> 51:25.999
You saved my life.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.299
[whispers] I won't forget.

52:31.398 --> 52:32.607
[in Spanish] How's it going?

52:35.777 --> 52:36.862
What a face.

52:37.529 --> 52:39.531
You look like you have a story to tell me.

52:39.614 --> 52:40.532
No.

52:41.074 --> 52:42.534
I better tell you what I saw.

52:44.870 --> 52:46.329
Kilos of cocaine.

52:47.247 --> 52:49.166
On the wrong side of the border.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.793
Just there piled up.

52:52.002 --> 52:53.211
No one moves them.

52:57.674 --> 52:59.092
Have you heard of...

53:00.302 --> 53:02.262
the South Florida Task Force?

53:05.599 --> 53:08.393
The gringos already closed
the Caribbean routes.

53:09.227 --> 53:12.189
Now the Colombians will need new routes.

53:14.316 --> 53:17.736
I thought that was a small business.
Something niche.

53:17.819 --> 53:20.572
It was. Not anymore.

53:25.243 --> 53:26.995
What's your friend's name?

53:27.871 --> 53:29.289
-Matta.
-Yes.

53:30.999 --> 53:33.835
And your partners?
Did you check with them?

53:34.085 --> 53:35.003
No.

53:35.712 --> 53:38.215
I'm just gathering information.

53:39.549 --> 53:41.843
Well, cheers for that information.

53:42.385 --> 53:43.970
Wherever it takes us.

53:46.389 --> 53:47.349
Yes.
