03:32.834 --> 03:36.375
WHY? COME ON, MA.
NICK'S A GOOD GUY.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.166
TYPICAL GREEK.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.709
I KNOW WHAT
HE'S UP TO.

03:39.792 --> 03:42.709
IF I ACCEPT IT,
HE'LL THINK I'M EASY.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.750
I DON'T WANT
TO KNOW THIS.

03:44.834 --> 03:46.333
WHAT'S THAT?

03:48.125 --> 03:49.709
PRIME RIB.

03:49.792 --> 03:52.208
WHEN DID YOU
START EATING YOGURT?

03:52.291 --> 03:54.041
WHERE'S YOUR DANISH?

03:54.125 --> 03:56.000
I'M TRYING TO CUT BACK.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.375
YOU,  CUT BACK?

03:58.458 --> 04:00.208
MY PANTS ARE GETTING
A LITTLE TIGHT,

04:00.291 --> 04:01.875
SO I THOUGHT
I'D GIVE THIS A TRY.

04:01.959 --> 04:04.583
WELL, YOU CAN'T
EXPECT TO FIT
INTO BOYS' SIZES.

04:04.667 --> 04:06.875
YOU'RE NOT
A BOY ANYMORE.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.041
I'M 38 YEARS OLD, MA.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.417
I HAVEN'T BEEN
A BOY FOR 20 YEARS.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.542
MY SON, THE ANOREXIC.

04:12.625 --> 04:15.583

04:34.458 --> 04:37.583

04:56.750 --> 04:58.000

04:58.083 --> 04:59.792
MY EYES ARE PERFECT.

04:59.875 --> 05:04.458
THEN WHY ARE YOU
POURING ORANGE JUICE
IN YOUR COFFEE?

05:04.542 --> 05:06.166

06:21.667 --> 06:25.542

06:28.458 --> 06:30.041
THANK YOU, DANNY.

06:30.125 --> 06:32.125

06:36.750 --> 06:38.834
YEAH. I'LL START

06:38.917 --> 06:41.041

06:41.125 --> 06:42.417
TRUE.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.083
VERY TRUE.

06:47.291 --> 06:51.667
THE DISTRICT COURT
OF SALVATORE BUONARTE
AND DANNY MULDOON

06:51.750 --> 06:53.834

06:57.625 --> 07:00.375
UH, NAME'S
DWAYNE EARL TYRONE.

07:00.458 --> 07:03.083
APPARENTLY HE RAN
THIS PIECE-OF-SHIT
APARTMENT HOUSING

07:03.166 --> 07:04.417
DOWN ON
THE SOUTH SIDE.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.083
MOSTLY SENIOR
CITIZENS, RIGHT?

07:06.166 --> 07:09.375
WELL, HE'D TAKE
THEIR MONTHLY CHECKS,
CASH THEM,

07:09.458 --> 07:10.917
AND STRANGLE THEM
TO DEATH.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.583
AW, GEE.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.291
HOW COME GUYS
LIKE THAT DO THAT?

07:14.375 --> 07:16.417
CHEMICAL IMBALANCE
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.417
YEAH?

07:17.500 --> 07:18.750
I READ THAT SOMEWHERE.

07:18.834 --> 07:21.208
YOU MEAN IT'S KIND
OF A VITAMIN THING?

07:21.291 --> 07:23.917
YEAH. IT'S
A DEFICIENCY OF SOME
SORT, LIKE RICKETS.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.625
YEAH? YOU TAKE
VITAMINS, TYRONE?

07:26.709 --> 07:28.125
NAH.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.417
I'M GOING TO START
TAKING VITAMINS.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.333
YEAH, ME, TOO.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.458
SO...HOW'S THE WIFE?

07:43.542 --> 07:44.750
OOH.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.625
SHE CUT ME OFF, DANNY.

07:46.709 --> 07:47.917
FOR HOW LONG?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.291
SHE SAYS UNTIL I SEEK
PROFESSIONAL HELP.

07:50.375 --> 07:52.333
FOR WHAT?

07:52.417 --> 07:54.125
SHE THINKS I'M
GETTING WEIRD IN BED.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.667
ARE YOU?

07:55.750 --> 07:58.458
WELL...WE BEEN
DOING IT THE SAME WAY

07:58.542 --> 08:00.458
FOR THE PAST
10 YEARS, DANNY.

08:00.542 --> 08:02.458
ONCE A WEEK,
EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT,

08:02.542 --> 08:04.792
RIGHT AFTER
THE 9:00 SPORTS, RIGHT?

08:04.875 --> 08:07.250
SAME POSITION,
SEVEN MINUTES OF FOREPLAY,

08:07.333 --> 08:11.125
12 MINUTES OF SEX,
AND WE KEEP OUR
PAJAMA TOPS ON.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.458
WELL, I'M GETTING
BORED OUT OF MY SKULL.
RIGHT, DANNY?

08:13.542 --> 08:16.083
SO I SAYS TO HER,
YOU KNOW,

08:16.166 --> 08:17.333
"WHY DON'T WE ADD
A LITTLE SPICE?"

08:17.417 --> 08:19.834
YOU KNOW,
GO STATE OF THE ART.

08:19.917 --> 08:20.917
STATE OF THE ART?

08:21.041 --> 08:22.333
WELL, YEAH,
STATE OF THE ART.

08:22.417 --> 08:24.500
YOU KNOW, NOW IT'S
THE COMPUTER AGE, RIGHT?

08:24.583 --> 08:26.166
ELECTRONICS AND STUFF.

08:26.250 --> 08:29.333
SO I FIGURE I'LL GO TO
THE MATURE SHOP, RIGHT?

08:29.417 --> 08:30.333
PICK UP SOMETHING.

08:30.417 --> 08:32.041
I BOUGHT ME
ONE OF THESE...

08:32.125 --> 08:35.166
THESE BIG DIGITAL
MARRIAGE COUNSELORS, RIGHT?

08:35.250 --> 08:37.166
WHAT'S THAT?

08:37.250 --> 08:38.332
IT'S A BIG, YOU KNOW...

08:38.417 --> 08:39.833
IT'S LIKE, UH...

08:39.917 --> 08:42.291
IT'S A LOVE ENHANCER.
IT'S LIKE A DEVICE.

08:42.375 --> 08:44.667
ALL RIGHT. SO I BRING THIS

08:44.750 --> 08:46.291
INTO THE BEDROOM
ON SATURDAY NIGHT.

08:46.375 --> 08:48.667
I PULL IT OUT.
I PUT IT ON HER PILLOW.

08:48.750 --> 08:49.875
YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE SURPRISE.

08:49.959 --> 08:51.709
SURPRISED THE SHIT
OUT OF HER.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.500
SHE FREAKS.
SHE TRIES TO KILL IT.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.333
SHE THINKS IT'S
A GIANT CENTIPEDE.

08:55.417 --> 08:57.500
YOU'RE KIDDING.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.500
SO I BEEN ON THE COUCH
EVER SINCE.

08:59.583 --> 09:02.500
OH, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.583
I ENVY YOU, THOUGH.
ME?

09:04.667 --> 09:06.208
YEAH. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO PUT UP

09:06.291 --> 09:07.875
WITH THIS BULLSHIT
AND HEARTACHE, YOU KNOW?

09:07.959 --> 09:10.375
YOU CAN JUMP IN THE SACK
WITH ANY CHICK YOU WANT.

09:10.458 --> 09:12.375
IF SHE DON'T
LIKE YOUR HABITS,

09:12.458 --> 09:13.834
YOU'RE ON
TO THE NEXT ONE.

09:13.917 --> 09:16.375
WELL, IT'S BEEN
A LITTLE SLOW LATELY.

09:16.458 --> 09:19.333
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
THE MOST INFURIATING
THING ABOUT YOU--

09:19.417 --> 09:23.583
YOU DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF YOUR GOD-GIVEN
POSITION IN LIFE.

09:23.667 --> 09:26.208
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE ON A DATE?

09:26.291 --> 09:28.041
TWO, THREE MONTHS AGO.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.917
NINE. TRY NINE, DANNY.
HEY, WHO'S COUNTING?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.375
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU GOT LAID?

09:32.458 --> 09:35.083
SAL.
COME ON, WHEN?

09:35.166 --> 09:36.709
IT'S BEEN SO LONG,
YOU DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER, DO YOU?

09:36.792 --> 09:38.083
HEY, I REMEMBER.

09:38.166 --> 09:39.083
SO, WHEN?

09:39.166 --> 09:41.041
THAT'S PERSONAL.

09:41.125 --> 09:44.125
OH, YEAH? WHY DON'T WE TRY
FIVE YEARS PERSONAL, DANNY?

09:44.208 --> 09:45.542
WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP

09:45.625 --> 09:47.125
AND MIND YOUR OWN
BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT?

09:47.208 --> 09:49.166
OK.

10:01.542 --> 10:03.083
GOOD NIGHT, SON.

10:03.166 --> 10:05.000
GOOD NIGHT, MOM.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.458
15, HUT!

10:17.542 --> 10:20.125
GO ON. TURN!

10:21.291 --> 10:22.417
OOH.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.291
YOU KNOW, COACH
SAYS HE'S A NATURAL.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.375
AT WHAT?

10:27.250 --> 10:28.583
AT WIDE RECEIVER.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.583
MAYBE IF HE PUT
SOME WEIGHT ON.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.583
HE COULD BE A JOCKEY.

10:32.667 --> 10:33.792
I'M KIDDING.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.959
OR A GUARD
OR A TACKLE, MAYBE.

10:36.041 --> 10:36.959
SAME THING.

10:37.041 --> 10:37.959
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

10:38.041 --> 10:40.458
ON 1--SET, 35-HUT!

10:40.542 --> 10:41.917
GO, GO, GO,
GO, GO.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.291
OK, BILLY, BILLY,
BILLY. RIGHT THERE.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.917
CATCH THE BALL, BILLY.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.458
I HATE THIS GAME.

10:48.542 --> 10:50.250
BILLY.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.959
BILLY, WOULD YOU
COME BACK AND PRACTICE?

10:53.041 --> 10:55.125
WHAT DOES HE HAVE
TO PRACTICE FOR?

10:55.208 --> 10:56.500
HE'S A NATURAL.

10:56.583 --> 10:57.875
LET'S GET A BEER.

10:59.041 --> 11:00.000
HOW'S WORK?

11:00.083 --> 11:01.291
IT'S FINE.

11:01.375 --> 11:02.792
AREN'T YOU
GETTING TIRED OF IT?

11:02.875 --> 11:05.125
NO, NO. SAL AND I,
WE HAVE A LOT OF LAUGHS.

11:05.208 --> 11:07.792
STILL, DANNY, YOU'VE
BEEN DRIVING THAT WAGON

11:07.875 --> 11:09.500
FOR WHAT, 15 YEARS?

11:09.583 --> 11:11.875
PICKING UP STIFFS,
HAULING AWAY CRIMINALS.

11:11.959 --> 11:13.500
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

11:13.583 --> 11:14.834
I DON'T WANT BETTER.

11:14.917 --> 11:16.333
LOOK, I AM THIS CLOSE

11:16.417 --> 11:18.166
TO JOHN BURROWS,
YOUR SUPERINTENDENT.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.500
NOW, WE PLAY GOLF
EVERY SUNDAY.

11:20.583 --> 11:23.625
JUST SAY THE WORD,
AND I COULD GET YOU
TRANSFERRED TO FLORIDA.

11:23.709 --> 11:24.667
NAH. I DON'T WANT TO GO.

11:24.750 --> 11:25.959
COME ON, DANNY.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.834
YOU AND MOM CAN GET
THAT WATERFRONT CONDO

11:27.917 --> 11:29.500
THAT YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.166
I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO FLORIDA.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.500
I'M NOT READY
TO RETIRE YET, OK?

11:33.583 --> 11:35.291
OK.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.500
JUST SAY THE WORD.

11:36.583 --> 11:38.500
FINE. THANK YOU.

11:38.583 --> 11:41.375
WELL, IT GIVES
PATRICK HEADACHES.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.834
WELL, HE NEVER
HAD HEADACHES WHEN
HE LIVED WITH ME.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.500
SO HOW'S MOM?

11:45.583 --> 11:47.834
SHE LOOKS TIRED.

11:47.917 --> 11:49.875
SHE NEEDS A CHANGE,
YOU KNOW?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT.

11:52.083 --> 11:54.542
SUSAN AND I WOULD
TAKE HER FOR A WHILE.

11:54.625 --> 11:55.792
YOU WOULD?

11:57.834 --> 11:59.208
YEAH, BUT SHE'D
HATE IT HERE.

11:59.291 --> 12:00.667
MAYBE NOT.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.208
I JUST THINK SHE'S HAPPIER
IN HER OWN HOUSE.

12:03.291 --> 12:05.250
YOU KNOW,
WHERE WE GREW UP,

12:05.333 --> 12:07.375
WHERE SHE AND DAD LIVED,

12:07.458 --> 12:09.000
WHERE SHE KNEW EVERYBODY.

12:09.083 --> 12:10.875
AND WHERE I CAN
TAKE CARE OF HER, RIGHT?

12:10.959 --> 12:13.834
WELL, YEAH.
THAT, TOO. SO WHAT?

12:13.917 --> 12:15.875
I MEAN, YOU MAKE
HER HAPPY, DAN.

12:15.959 --> 12:16.917
YOU'RE HER FAVORITE SON.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.875
AW, COME ON.
DON'T PULL THAT.

12:18.959 --> 12:21.542
PLUS YOU GET
YOUR MEALS COOKED,
YOUR LAUNDRY DONE,

12:21.625 --> 12:23.875
AND YOUR BED MADE.
BELIEVE ME,

12:23.959 --> 12:26.291
YOU'LL NEVER FIND A WIFE
WHO'LL DO ALL THAT.

12:27.959 --> 12:29.875
YOU'RE A GOOD
LAWYER, PATRICK.

12:29.959 --> 12:32.500
A VERY GOOD LAWYER.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.750
YOU KNOW, MAYBE A GYMNAST.

12:37.834 --> 12:39.000
AAH!

12:45.542 --> 12:46.875
GOOD EVENING, CLARK.

12:46.959 --> 12:50.000
AH, EVENING, ROSE.
EVENING, DANNY.

12:51.875 --> 12:55.291
AH, TWO MORE
THIRSTY MOUTHS.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.750
THE USUAL, IS IT?

12:56.834 --> 12:57.917
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.583
WHAT'S THE SCORE?

12:59.667 --> 13:00.917
BOSTON'S WINNING BY 3.

13:01.000 --> 13:01.917
AW, GEE.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.875
YOU DIDN'T MISS MUCH.

BE SERVING YOU.

13:21.166 --> 13:22.959
WHY?

13:23.041 --> 13:24.333
YOU'VE ALREADY HAD
A BIT TOO MUCH,

13:24.417 --> 13:26.458
AND YOUR FRIEND
THERE'S FLUTHERED.

13:26.542 --> 13:27.917
FLUTHERED?
YEAH.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.333
IT'S PARCHED, HE IS.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.625
HE HASN'T WET HIS LIPS
IN 24 HOURS.

13:31.709 --> 13:36.417
FRANK, DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE
YOUR OLD PAL HERE?

13:39.041 --> 13:41.291
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.

13:41.375 --> 13:42.792
IT'S TOMMY BONES.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.458
SO?

13:44.542 --> 13:46.625
HE DIED YESTERDAY.

13:46.709 --> 13:47.750
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

13:47.834 --> 13:49.291
WE CAN EXPLAIN.

13:49.375 --> 13:50.792
LARRY, EXPLAIN.

13:50.875 --> 13:53.500
ONE AUGUST,
BACK IN '58,

13:53.583 --> 13:54.917
ME AND JACK HERE,

13:55.041 --> 13:57.166
WE MADE A PROMISE
TO TOMMY.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.834
WE SWORE WE'D
BRING HIM BACK
TO O'NEILL'S

13:59.917 --> 14:01.667
THE NIGHT
BEFORE HIS WAKE

14:01.750 --> 14:02.792
FOR ONE LAST JAMESON.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.291
YEAH,
FOR HIS JOURNEY.

14:05.375 --> 14:07.333
IT'S A SACRED DUTY, THEN?

14:07.417 --> 14:10.208
OH, YES.
OH, IT IS. IT IS.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.125
LET IT NEVER BE SAID

14:13.208 --> 14:17.417
THAT AN O'NEILL BROKE
A PROMISE TO THE DEAD.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.959
THREE DOUBLES IT IS.

14:22.041 --> 14:23.667
AND IF HE DRINKS IT,

14:23.750 --> 14:25.959
IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

14:27.542 --> 14:28.709
GRAVEROBBERS.

14:28.792 --> 14:30.208
ALL RIGHT.
GIVE HIM BACK.

14:30.291 --> 14:31.333
AFTER HE'S HAD A DRINK.

14:31.417 --> 14:32.333
NO, RIGHT NOW.

14:32.417 --> 14:34.000
WHEN HE'S HAD
A DRINK.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.667
LOOK, I COULD HAVE
YOU TWO ARRESTED.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.041
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T
WALK INTO A FUNERAL HOME,

14:38.125 --> 14:39.542
TAKE A CORPSE, AND
BRING IT TO A TAVERN.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.041
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, FOR GOD'S--

14:41.125 --> 14:43.166
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

14:43.250 --> 14:46.083
OFFICER,
THESE TWO IDIOTS

14:46.166 --> 14:48.750
SNUCK INTO
MY FUNERAL HOME
AND TOOK THE BODY

14:48.834 --> 14:50.500
WHILE MY DAUGHTER
THERESA WAS ON
HER COFFEE BREAK.

14:50.583 --> 14:52.166
ALL RIGHT. HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.583
YOU TWO ARE GOING
TO TAKE HIM BACK.

14:53.667 --> 14:56.083
THAT IS,
UNLESS YOU DECIDE
TO PRESS CHARGES.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.875
NO, NO. I DON'T WANT
TO PRESS CHARGES.

14:58.959 --> 15:02.375
OK, FINE.
TAKE THE BODY BACK.
HE CAN'T DRINK ANYWAY.

15:02.458 --> 15:05.417
WHAT DID YOU DO,
SEW HIS LIPS SHUT?

15:05.500 --> 15:06.917
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S
ENOUGH OUT OF YOU.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.083
ALL RIGHT? I WANT YOU TO TAKE
HIM BACK, UNDERSTAND?

15:09.166 --> 15:11.417
THEN THE BOTH OF YOU
GO HOME.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.875
DON'T BREAK HIM.

15:13.959 --> 15:16.959
EASY DOES IT
THROUGH THERE.

15:24.125 --> 15:25.458
ALL RIGHT.

15:25.542 --> 15:28.208
SO THAT WAS JOEY LUNA, HUH?
YEAH.

15:28.291 --> 15:30.542
HE'S GOT THE PARLOR OVER
THERE ON MORGAN STREET?

15:30.625 --> 15:31.583
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.250
I GUESS THAT
WAS HIS DAUGHTER.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.291
SHE WORKS FOR HIM.

15:34.375 --> 15:35.417
OH, YEAH? DOING WHAT?

15:35.500 --> 15:37.041
PAINTING FACES.

15:37.125 --> 15:38.417
DEAD FACES?

15:38.500 --> 15:39.750
YEAH. SHE COULDN'T
GET A JOB

15:39.834 --> 15:40.917
RIGHT OUT
OF COSMETICS SCHOOL.

15:41.000 --> 15:41.917
IS SHE MARRIED?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.750
NO. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

15:43.834 --> 15:46.125
THE BUSINESS SHE'S IN
TURNS MOST GUYS OFF.

15:46.208 --> 15:47.583
OH, IT WOULD. YEAH.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.083
WHY? ARE YOU
INTERESTED?

15:49.166 --> 15:50.709
OH, NO. NO, NO. I'M JUST
CURIOUS, THAT'S ALL.

15:50.792 --> 15:52.250
YOU KNOW, I...

15:52.333 --> 15:53.917
IF YOU ARE, GO FOR IT.
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

15:54.000 --> 15:54.917
ASK THE GIRL OUT.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.083
WHY SHOULD HE?

15:56.166 --> 15:57.750
HE'S PERFECTLY
HAPPY NOW.

15:57.834 --> 15:59.083
WHY SCREW
THINGS UP?

15:59.166 --> 16:00.500
DON'T LISTEN
TO HIM, DANNY BOY.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.792
DON'T END UP BACHELORS
LIKE THE TWO OF US.

16:02.875 --> 16:03.959
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

16:04.041 --> 16:05.291
DANNY'S DOING FINE.

16:05.375 --> 16:07.333
HE DOESN'T HAVE
TO GO CHASING SOME GHOUL

16:07.417 --> 16:09.417
FROM A FUNERAL PARLOR
FOR A DATE.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.959
HE CAN DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.000
HE DOESN'T HAVE TIME
TO DO BETTER.

16:13.083 --> 16:14.625
ALL THE GOOD ONES
WILL BE TAKEN.

16:14.709 --> 16:16.625
THE GIRLS SHOULD
BE CHASING HIM.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.166
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

16:18.250 --> 16:20.291
I'M GETTING ROMANTIC
ADVICE FROM A WIDOW

16:20.375 --> 16:21.750
AND TWO BACHELORS.

16:21.834 --> 16:23.291
ONE VERY EXPERIENCED
BACHELOR.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.959
CELIBACY IS CONSIDERED
EXPERIENCE?

16:26.041 --> 16:28.792
OH, I'VE HAD
ME SHARE OF WOMEN.
THREE.

16:28.875 --> 16:30.291
JUST NEVER BEEN
STUPID ENOUGH
TO MARRY THEM.

16:30.375 --> 16:31.917
YOU NEVER BEEN
FORTUNATE ENOUGH.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.291
THEY ALL SAID NO.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.166
IF I'D HAVE
GOTTEN MARRIED,

16:35.250 --> 16:37.083
I WOULDN'T BE
WHERE I AM NOW.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.291
IN A TAVERN?

16:38.375 --> 16:40.500
FREE, LIVING
LIKE A KING.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.000
YOU LIVE AT THE Y.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.333
I DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER TO ANYONE.

16:44.417 --> 16:45.959
I COME AND GO
AS I PLEASE.

16:46.041 --> 16:48.000
I DO WHAT I WANT
WHEN I WANT.

16:48.083 --> 16:49.834
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM,
DANNY BOY.

16:49.917 --> 16:51.125
CALL THAT GIRL.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.458
DON'T SPEND YOUR LIFE
FULL OF REGRETS.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.250
...BE SEEING ME.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.625
I'LL BE
SEEING YOU, TOO.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.875
EVERY DAY
AND EVERY NIGHT
AND EVERY MINUTE...

18:11.166 --> 18:14.208
COULD HAVE BEEN...

18:14.291 --> 18:16.250
IT CAN'T BE.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.875
GOODBYE, FOUNTAIN...

18:21.959 --> 18:23.250
AND GOD BLESS YOU.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.834
GOODBYE, BLAKE.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.458
GOODBYE, DAN.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.166
YOU MISSED A SPOT.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.458
I'M--IT WAS
JUST A JOKE.

18:47.542 --> 18:50.291
I'M S--I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SCARE YOU.

18:50.375 --> 18:52.417
NO ONE IS ALLOWED
BACK HERE.

18:53.417 --> 18:55.333
SORRY. I, UM...

18:55.417 --> 18:57.875
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

18:59.208 --> 19:01.750
NO. NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

19:01.834 --> 19:04.667
I--ACTUALLY, UH...

19:04.750 --> 19:08.959
I SAW YOU
AT O'NEILL'S
THE OTHER NIGHT,

19:09.041 --> 19:11.875
AND, UH...

19:12.750 --> 19:14.250
WELL...

19:17.000 --> 19:19.834
I--I, UM...

19:19.917 --> 19:21.458
OHH...

19:21.542 --> 19:24.250
DON'T YOU JUST
HATE ALL THAT
AWKWARD STUFF

19:24.333 --> 19:26.417
THAT, UH, GOES WITH
ASKING SOMEONE OUT

19:26.500 --> 19:28.750
ON A DATE
FOR THE FIRST TIME?

19:32.625 --> 19:34.667
I'LL MAKE IT EASY
FOR YOU.

19:34.750 --> 19:37.667
I'LL GIVE YOU A LIST
OF POSSIBLE EXCUSES,

19:37.750 --> 19:40.542
THINGS I'VE HEARD
A MILLION TIMES
BEFORE.

19:40.625 --> 19:43.542
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SAY YES OR NO.

19:43.625 --> 19:47.166
THAT WAY, IT TAKES
THE PRESSURE OFF
BOTH OF US.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.000
MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

19:49.083 --> 19:50.208
YEAH.

19:50.291 --> 19:53.291
GOOD. OK, UH,
HERE WE GO.

19:53.375 --> 19:56.667
REASONS WHY YOU
CAN'T GO OUT WITH ME
ON SATURDAY--

19:56.750 --> 19:58.208
YOU'RE SEEING
SOMEBODY ELSE.

19:58.291 --> 19:59.500
NO.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.041
YOU'RE HAVING YOUR
WISDOM TEETH PULLED.

20:01.125 --> 20:02.500
NO.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.166
YOU'RE WASHING
YOUR HAIR.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.333
NO.

20:05.417 --> 20:06.667
YOU'RE GOING
SHOPPING.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.667
YOU HAVE TO BABYSIT
FOR YOUR, UH,

20:08.750 --> 20:10.834
NEIGHBOR'S KIDS,
NIECES, OR NEPHEWS.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.208
NO.

20:12.291 --> 20:13.542
YOU'RE DOING
THE LAUNDRY.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.208
NO.

20:15.291 --> 20:17.041
YOU HAVE TO
LUBE YOUR CAR?

20:17.125 --> 20:18.709
NO.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.959
YOU'RE GETTING
YOUR LEGS WAXED.

20:22.625 --> 20:23.667
NO.

20:25.417 --> 20:28.000
I THINK THAT JUST ABOUT
COVERS EVERYTHING.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.333
YOU FORGOT ONE THING.

20:30.417 --> 20:32.291
WHAT'S THAT?

20:33.458 --> 20:34.917
IF SOMEBODY DIES,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.667
I'M STUCK HERE.

20:37.917 --> 20:39.208
OH, SURE. OF COURSE.

20:39.291 --> 20:41.875
YEAH, THAT-- YEAH,
THAT--I-- YEAH, SURE.

20:41.959 --> 20:45.625
BUT NOBODY DIED YET.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.959
SO YOU'RE, UH...

20:51.083 --> 20:52.125
Uh-huh.

THAT'S TERRIFIC.

20:54.959 --> 20:56.625
GREAT. THANKS. OK.

20:56.709 --> 20:57.959
THAT'S--
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.375
THANK YOU.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.959
UM, HOW ABOUT 7:00
I'LL PICK YOU UP?

21:02.041 --> 21:04.250
UH...
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

21:04.333 --> 21:05.709
HERE.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.625

21:08.709 --> 21:12.250
MY FATHER AND I

UPSTAIRS.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.208
OH, SURE.
OF COURSE.

21:14.291 --> 21:17.041
THAT'S--THAT'S, UH,
CONVENIENT.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.083
YEAH,

55:00.834 --> 55:02.291
MORE THAN THREE
TIMES DURING DINNER,

55:02.375 --> 55:04.792
THAT'S A SIGN
SHE'S BULIMIC.
WHAT?

55:04.875 --> 55:06.792
SHE'S THROWING UP
WHAT SHE JUST ATE
IN THE BATHROOM.

55:06.875 --> 55:07.792
OH, PLEASE.

55:07.875 --> 55:08.792
HI!

55:08.875 --> 55:09.792
HI.

55:09.875 --> 55:10.959
HOW ARE YOU?

55:11.041 --> 55:14.125
UH, MA,
THIS IS THERESA.

55:14.208 --> 55:15.583
THERESA,
THIS IS MY MOTHER.

55:15.667 --> 55:17.917
PLEASED TO MEET YOU,
MRS. MULDOON.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.291
ROSE. I'M ROSE.
ROSE.

55:20.375 --> 55:22.458
OH, THAT'S
A LOVELY DRESS
YOU'RE WEARING.

55:22.542 --> 55:23.458
ISN'T IT?

55:23.542 --> 55:24.667
OH, THANK YOU.

55:24.750 --> 55:26.250
EVEN THOUGH IT IS
A LITTLE BIG ON TOP.

55:26.333 --> 55:27.333
MA.

55:27.417 --> 55:28.792
WELL, IT IS. YOU
SAID SO YOURSELF.

55:28.875 --> 55:31.500
NO. THAT'S A--
A PROBLEM I HAVE.

55:31.583 --> 55:33.959
I'M NOT REALLY
THAT ENDOWED ON TOP.

55:34.041 --> 55:35.291
NO, NO, NO, NO.

55:35.375 --> 55:36.583
YOU'RE BUILT LIKE
A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY.

55:36.667 --> 55:37.875
MOM, WOULD YOU
PLEASE DON'T START?

55:37.959 --> 55:39.458
IT'S A JOKE.

55:39.542 --> 55:40.875
I'M TRYING
TO MAKE JOKES HERE.

55:40.959 --> 55:43.000
I'M TRYING TO
LIGHTEN THINGS UP
A LITTLE.

55:43.083 --> 55:44.542
OK. THANK YOU.

55:44.625 --> 55:45.834
WOULD ANYONE LIKE
TO ORDER A COCKTAIL?

55:45.917 --> 55:47.542
YES.
OH, I'LL HAVE
A GLASS OF BEER.

55:47.625 --> 55:49.792
AND DON'T TRY
TO SNEAK ANY OF THAT
SOUR IMPORTED SWILL

55:49.875 --> 55:51.834
OFF ON ME
AT $6.00 A BOTTLE.

55:51.917 --> 55:55.125
JUST A PLAIN GLASS
OF BUDWEISER.

55:55.208 --> 55:57.000
YES, MA'AM. SIR?

55:57.083 --> 56:00.000
I'LL HAVE A BEER.
JUST ANY BEER IS FINE.

56:00.083 --> 56:01.667
YES, MA'AM?

56:01.750 --> 56:03.542
I'LL HAVE A VODKA
DOUBLE ON THE ROCKS.

56:03.625 --> 56:05.000
GOOD.

56:05.083 --> 56:06.500
AH, A VODKA DRINKER.

56:06.583 --> 56:08.500
WELL, MA, THERESA'S
PROBABLY A LITTLE NERVOUS.

56:08.583 --> 56:10.500
YOU KNOW, BEING HERE
WITH US AND ALL.

56:10.583 --> 56:12.000
YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

56:12.083 --> 56:13.875
IT'S THE FIRST SIGNS
OF ALCOHOLISM.

56:13.959 --> 56:15.375
WHAT?

56:15.458 --> 56:16.667
I READ IT IN
READER'S DIGEST.

56:16.750 --> 56:18.375
ROSE, I CAN ASSURE YOU

56:18.458 --> 56:19.875
I'M NOT AN ALCOHOLIC.

56:19.959 --> 56:21.917
OH, DENIAL--
THAT'S ANOTHER SYMPTOM.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.709
THE ARTICLE SAID
THAT ONE SHOT OF VODKA

56:24.792 --> 56:26.667
WAS EQUAL
TO ALL OF THE CALORIES

56:26.750 --> 56:28.208
IN A HAM SANDWICH.

56:28.291 --> 56:30.709
GOOD. MAYBE I'LL
GAIN SOME WEIGHT

56:30.792 --> 56:32.166
AND GROW BREASTS FOR YOU.

56:32.250 --> 56:36.083
HA HA HA HA HA.
THAT'S FUNNY.

56:36.166 --> 56:37.959
THA--GROWING BREASTS.

56:42.625 --> 56:43.875
LET'S ORDER, SHALL WE?

56:43.959 --> 56:44.875
SHALL WE ORDER?

56:44.959 --> 56:45.917
THERESA.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.375
MA.

56:47.458 --> 56:49.041
WELL, I KNOW
WHAT I'M HAVING.

56:49.125 --> 56:50.500
YES, SIR?

56:50.583 --> 56:54.333
I'LL HAVE THE SHRIMP COCKTAIL,
PLEASE,

56:54.417 --> 56:56.875
AND THE CAESAR SALAD,
NO ANCHOVIES,

56:56.959 --> 56:58.208
AND THE PRIME RIB...

56:58.291 --> 56:59.375
UH, MEDIUM.

56:59.458 --> 57:00.375
VERY GOOD.

57:00.458 --> 57:01.917
MAKE THAT MEDIUM RARE.

57:02.000 --> 57:02.917
VERY GOOD, SIR.

57:03.000 --> 57:03.959
THANK YOU.

57:04.041 --> 57:04.959
THERE YOU GO.

57:05.041 --> 57:05.959
THANK YOU.

57:06.041 --> 57:07.000
MA'AM?

57:10.625 --> 57:13.709
UM, I'LL HAVE
THE--THE GRILLED CHICKEN.

57:13.792 --> 57:15.125
GOOD.
THAT'S ALL.

57:15.208 --> 57:16.417
DON'T YOU WANT
AN APPETIZER?

57:16.500 --> 57:17.417
NO, THANK YOU.

57:17.500 --> 57:18.875
Don't push it.

57:20.709 --> 57:22.458
UH, MA'AM?

57:23.500 --> 57:24.709
NOTHING.

57:24.792 --> 57:25.875
NOTHING?

57:25.959 --> 57:27.917
NOTHING FOR ME.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.125
MA.

57:29.208 --> 57:30.291
JUST BREAD.

57:30.375 --> 57:31.291
MA.

57:31.375 --> 57:33.542
BREAD'S FINE,
THANK YOU.

57:35.208 --> 57:37.250
THANK YOU.

57:37.333 --> 57:39.583
Are you trying
to ruin this dinner?

57:39.667 --> 57:42.250
I'm trying
to save you $50.

57:42.333 --> 57:43.500
I'll fill up
on bread here

57:43.583 --> 57:45.291
and eat something
when I get home.

57:45.375 --> 57:46.959
I don't believe this!

57:47.041 --> 57:48.250
NOW, THERESA,

57:48.333 --> 57:51.917
DANNY TELLS ME THAT
YOU'RE SICILIAN.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.333
YES.

57:53.417 --> 57:54.917
PART.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.291
PART?

57:56.375 --> 57:58.291
MY FATHER IS SICILIAN.

57:58.375 --> 58:00.166
MY MOTHER WAS POLISH.

58:00.250 --> 58:01.458
Ohh!

58:01.542 --> 58:03.000
POLISH.

58:03.083 --> 58:04.709
YES.

58:05.333 --> 58:06.250
Polish?

58:06.333 --> 58:07.917
I MEANT TO TELL YOU.

58:08.875 --> 58:09.792
POLISH?

58:09.875 --> 58:11.333
POLISH.

58:11.417 --> 58:13.125
I HAD A POLACK
FRIEND ONCE.

58:13.208 --> 58:14.291
SHE WAS
INCREDIBLY STUPID.

58:14.375 --> 58:15.291
DON'T DO THIS, MA.

58:15.375 --> 58:16.834
JULIE KAPOWSKI.

58:16.917 --> 58:19.500
SHE WAS
THE STUPIDEST WOMAN
THAT I EVER KNEW.

58:19.583 --> 58:22.166
SHE BELIEVED
THAT BLACK COWS--

58:22.250 --> 58:23.583
HA HA HA HA!

58:23.667 --> 58:27.125
BLACK COWS SQUIRTED
CHOCOLATE MILK.

58:27.208 --> 58:29.333
I THINK IT'S BETTER
IF YOU AND DANNY
HAVE DINNER ALONE.

58:29.417 --> 58:30.667
THERESA, WAIT.

58:30.750 --> 58:32.041
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
MY GRILLED CHICKEN?

58:32.125 --> 58:33.709
CUT IT UP IN SMALL
PIECES AND DEVOUR IT.

58:33.792 --> 58:35.166
YOU SEEM TO BE
VERY GOOD AT THAT.

58:35.250 --> 58:36.750
OH.

58:39.875 --> 58:41.625
THERESA.

58:44.250 --> 58:45.500
YOU ALL RIGHT?

58:45.583 --> 58:47.875
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN
AN ARGUMENT BEFORE.

58:47.959 --> 58:50.500
I'VE NEVER SAID
THOSE THINGS TO ANYBODY.

58:50.583 --> 58:52.500
I FEEL LIKE I'M
GOING TO THROW UP.

58:52.583 --> 58:54.875
JUST TAKE
A DEEP BREATH.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

58:54.959 --> 58:56.500
I ACTUALLY
STOOD UP FOR MYSELF

58:56.583 --> 58:59.208
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE...

58:59.291 --> 59:01.166
NOT THAT I HAD
MUCH CHOICE.

59:01.250 --> 59:02.166
WHAT?

59:02.250 --> 59:03.375
YOU JUST SAT THERE.

59:03.458 --> 59:05.542
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO STOP HER.

59:05.625 --> 59:06.583
LIKE WHAT?

59:06.667 --> 59:07.583
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

59:07.667 --> 59:09.000
SCREAM AT HER,
SLAP HER--

59:09.083 --> 59:10.875
JUST GET HER
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

59:10.959 --> 59:12.208
THERESA,
SHE'S MY MOTHER.

59:12.291 --> 59:14.875
SO THAT GIVES HER THE RIGHT
TO RIP ME APART?

59:14.959 --> 59:15.917
WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

59:16.000 --> 59:17.875
FIGHT FOR ME.

59:17.959 --> 59:19.208
FIGHT FOR YOU?

59:19.291 --> 59:21.000
YOU'VE GOT
TO UNDERSTAND
MY MOTHER.

59:21.083 --> 59:23.000
SHE'S OLD. SHE'S
SET IN HER WAYS.

59:23.083 --> 59:26.500
IT'S GOING
TO TAKE HER A WHILE
TO GET USED TO YOU.

59:26.583 --> 59:28.041
NO, IT WON'T.

59:28.125 --> 59:29.709
WHY NOT?

59:29.792 --> 59:31.875
BECAUSE
I WON'T BE AROUND.

59:31.959 --> 59:33.834
OH, PLEASE
DON'T DO THIS.

59:33.917 --> 59:37.917
NO. I WANT A GUY WHO WILL
ALWAYS FIGHT FOR ME,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.208
WHO WILL ALWAYS
STAND UP FOR ME,

59:40.291 --> 59:42.500
WHO WILL NEVER
LET ME DOWN.

59:42.583 --> 59:45.000
I THOUGHT
THAT GUY WAS YOU.

59:48.375 --> 59:50.208
I WAS WRONG.

59:53.208 --> 59:54.625
WAIT A MINUTE,
THERESA.

59:54.709 --> 59:55.625
TAXI!

59:55.709 --> 59:56.625
COME ON.

59:56.709 --> 59:58.291
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

59:58.375 --> 59:59.792
DON'T
DO THIS.

59:59.875 --> 01:00:02.583
LOOK, DON'T
DO THIS.

01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:04.792
THERESA, LET'S
TALK ABOUT IT,
ALL RIGHT?

01:00:04.875 --> 01:00:06.166
JUST TALK TO ME.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.959
I'M STARVING.

01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:44.333
I'M GOING TO THE KITCHEN
TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

01:00:44.417 --> 01:00:45.834
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE
PROUD OF YOURSELF.

01:00:45.917 --> 01:00:47.291
JUST TELLING IT
LIKE IT IS.

01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:50.625
THAT'S BEEN YOUR EXCUSE
FOR THE LAST 67 YEARS.

01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:51.959
MY EXCUSE?

01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:53.500
YOUR EXCUSE
FOR HURTING PEOPLE

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.166
WHENEVER THE HELL
YOU FEEL LIKE IT.

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:57.500
I DON'T HURT PEOPLE.
OH, NO?

01:00:57.583 --> 01:00:59.959
I GUESS YOU DIDN'T
HURT AUNT DOLLY
ON HER WEDDING DAY

01:01:00.041 --> 01:01:01.458
WHEN YOU SAID
SHE LOOKED LIKE

01:01:01.542 --> 01:01:02.792
A CHEAP
LAS VEGAS HOOKER.

01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:04.125
WELL, DID YOU SEE
THE WEDDING DRESS?

01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:06.125
THE BACK OF IT WAS CUT
RIGHT DOWN TO HERE.

01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:07.625
YOU COULD SEE
THE CRACK OF HER--

01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:09.166
WELL, IT WAS INDECENT.

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:10.500
AND I GUESS YOU DIDN'T
HURT COUSIN JERRY

01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:12.208
WHEN YOU CALLED
HIS GERMAN WIFE

01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:14.792
A NAZI WHO PROBABLY
SLEPT WITH HITLER.

01:01:14.875 --> 01:01:18.917
WELL, THERE'S NO PROOF
THAT SHE DIDN'T.

01:01:20.083 --> 01:01:23.041
I GUESS YOU NEVER
HURT DAD EITHER.

01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:29.375
I NEVER
HURT YOUR FATHER,

01:01:29.458 --> 01:01:30.458
EVER.

01:01:30.542 --> 01:01:32.417
FLORSHEIM SHOES?

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.792
HOW DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:39.208
YOU CAME HOME LATE.
YOU WERE ARGUING.

01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:40.500
I WOKE UP.
I WAS SCARED.

01:01:40.583 --> 01:01:41.834
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

01:01:41.917 --> 01:01:43.792
SO I LISTENED IN
AT THE DOOR.

01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:46.625
A LITTLE SPY.

01:01:46.709 --> 01:01:48.166
COME ON.
I WAS ONLY 12.

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.709
SPY!

01:01:49.792 --> 01:01:51.166
FLORSHEIM SHOES
WAS HIS BIG ACCOUNT.

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:52.333
HE WORKED ON THAT
FOR OVER 2 1/2 YEARS.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:53.542
YOU BLEW IT FOR HIM
IN ONE NIGHT.

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:55.000
DANNY, DON'T.

01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:57.000
ALL HE HAD TO DO
WAS SIGN A DEAL
AT DINNER--

01:01:57.083 --> 01:01:59.542
ONE FANCY-SCHMANCY
DINNER

01:01:59.625 --> 01:02:01.834
WITH A V.P.
FROM FLORSHEIM.

01:02:01.917 --> 01:02:03.583
I'M GOING TO BED.

01:02:03.667 --> 01:02:05.583
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

01:02:05.667 --> 01:02:07.750
EVERYTHING WAS FINE
THAT EVENING--

01:02:07.834 --> 01:02:09.083
DINNER WAS PERFECT,

01:02:09.166 --> 01:02:11.375
DAD HAD HIM IN
THE PALM OF HIS HAND

01:02:11.458 --> 01:02:13.709
UNTIL YOU DECIDED
TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS.

01:02:13.792 --> 01:02:14.917
I WAS RIGHT.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.041
I STILL STAND BY
WHAT I SAID.

01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:20.500
YOU CALLED DAD'S BOSSES
FILTHY JEW SHYLOCKS.

01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:22.417
THEY NEVER
GAVE HIM A RAISE,

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.834
NOT IN 12 YEARS.

01:02:23.917 --> 01:02:25.417
NOT ONE
CHRISTMAS BONUS!

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.542
MA...

01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:27.750
THE VICE PRESIDENT
OF FLORSHEIM

01:02:27.834 --> 01:02:29.083
AND HIS WIFE
WERE JEWISH.

01:02:29.166 --> 01:02:30.667
WELL, HOW WAS I
SUPPOSED TO KNOW?

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:31.750
THEY DIDN'T
LOOK JEWISH.

01:02:31.834 --> 01:02:32.917
I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT THEM.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.083
THEY TOOK IT
PERSONAL.

01:02:34.166 --> 01:02:35.959
YOU LOST THE ACCOUNT
FOR HIM!

01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:38.583
$450,000 TO THE COMPANY!

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:40.583
HE'S LUCKY HE DIDN'T
LOSE HIS JOB!

01:02:40.667 --> 01:02:42.917
YOUR FATHER NEVER
STOOD UP TO HIS BOSSES.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.917
IT WAS TIME SOMEBODY
SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.750
THAT NIGHT
WAS THE ONLY TIME

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:52.917
I EVER HEARD
MY FATHER CRY,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.750
AND STILL,
TO THIS DAY,

01:02:55.834 --> 01:02:59.125
YOU STILL
TELL IT LIKE IT IS.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.041

EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE
NO SINS TO CONFESS,

01:08:15.834 --> 01:08:19.417
JUST SO THEY CAN
BLATHER WITH THE PRIEST
ABOUT VATICAN II.

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.125
AND THEY STAND IN LINE
OUTSIDE THE MOVIE THEATER,

01:08:22.207 --> 01:08:24.375
EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE
SEEN THE MOVIE 10 TIMES,

01:08:24.457 --> 01:08:27.250
JUST SO THEY CAN
COMPLAIN TO WHOEVER'S
STANDING NEAR THEM

01:08:27.332 --> 01:08:29.250
ABOUT THE PRICE

01:08:29.332 --> 01:08:31.375
AND THEY STAND IN LINE
AT THE GROCERY STORE

01:08:31.457 --> 01:08:33.457
JUST SO THEY CAN
COMPLAIN TO THE CASHIER

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:36.082
ABOUT THE PRICE
OF FROZEN STRING BEANS,

01:08:36.166 --> 01:08:39.959
WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE
29 CENTS OR 39 CENTS.

01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:42.082
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY

01:08:42.166 --> 01:08:44.250
THEY SPEND SO MUCH TIME
STANDING IN LINE?

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:45.709
NO.

01:08:45.792 --> 01:08:47.417
BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY ELSE

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.709
IN THE WHOLE WORLD
THEY CAN TALK TO.

01:09:00.207 --> 01:09:01.457
HOW DOES THAT LOOK?

01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:02.457

ME BEING YOUR

01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:11.834
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED.

01:26:11.917 --> 01:26:13.667
JUST FORGET IT.

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:16.125
IT WAS YOUR MA,
WASN'T IT?

01:26:16.208 --> 01:26:17.792
SHE MADE YOU CALL IT OFF,
DIDN'T SHE?

01:26:17.875 --> 01:26:19.000
NO.

01:26:19.083 --> 01:26:21.000
IT WASN'T A SEXUAL
PROBLEM, WAS IT?

01:26:21.083 --> 01:26:22.959
I MEAN, YOU CAN FUNCTION
AS A MAN AND ALL, RIGHT?

01:26:23.041 --> 01:26:24.625
JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH.

01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:26.000
IT WAS HER.

01:26:26.083 --> 01:26:27.834
WHAT, DID SHE WANT TO
DO IT LIKE A CORPSE?

01:26:27.917 --> 01:26:29.166
YOU KNOW I HEAR
THEY'RE WEIRD,

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:31.000
THESE PEOPLE THAT WORK
WITH THE DEAD.

01:26:31.083 --> 01:26:33.625
HEY, WHAT
IS WITH YOU?
WHAT?

01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:36.166
DOES EVERYTHING
IN YOUR LIFE HAVE
TO RELATE TO SEX?

01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:37.834
EVERYTHING IN LIFE DOES
RELATE TO SEX, DANNY.

01:26:37.917 --> 01:26:39.542
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

01:26:39.625 --> 01:26:42.166
DO YOU REALIZE THAT
45% OF THESE PEOPLE

01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:43.458
IN THESE BUILDINGS
RIGHT NOW

01:26:43.542 --> 01:26:45.959
ARE HAVING SEX
OF SOME SORT?

01:26:46.041 --> 01:26:47.792
THAT'S A STATISTIC,
DANNY.

01:26:47.875 --> 01:26:49.000
AM I RIGHT?

01:26:49.083 --> 01:26:50.500
IT'S A FACT.

01:26:50.583 --> 01:26:51.959
IT'S A FACT.

01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:53.667
WHAT IS WITH YOU?
YOU'RE TWISTED.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:55.375
WHAT?

01:26:55.458 --> 01:26:56.583
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
WHAT'S IN YOUR MIND,

01:26:56.667 --> 01:26:58.041
YOU AND YOUR BUDDY
DR. RUTH BACK THERE?

01:26:58.125 --> 01:26:59.500
I MEAN, COME ON.

01:26:59.583 --> 01:27:01.750
OH, I CAN HARDLY WAIT
TO GET TO FLORIDA.

01:27:01.834 --> 01:27:03.208
MAYBE
I'LL FIND A PARTNER

01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:05.500
WHO'S GOT MORE THAN
A GRAPENUT FOR A BRAIN.

01:27:15.625 --> 01:27:16.542
THE USUAL?

01:27:16.625 --> 01:27:18.750
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE?

01:27:20.959 --> 01:27:22.709
AHH.

01:27:22.792 --> 01:27:24.375
WHERE'S DOYLE?

01:27:24.458 --> 01:27:26.583
HEART ATTACK.

01:27:26.667 --> 01:27:28.917
WHAT?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.166
THEY FOUND HIM
THIS MORNING.

01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:34.667
PASSED AWAY IN HIS SLEEP
LAST NIGHT.

01:27:54.667 --> 01:27:56.417
WHERE'S HIS FAMILY?

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.750
WHAT FAMILY?

01:27:58.834 --> 01:28:01.125
HIS MOM DIED
15 YEARS AGO.

01:28:01.208 --> 01:28:04.125
HE'S GOT A SISTER
IN A NURSING HOME.

01:28:04.208 --> 01:28:06.500
NEVER MARRIED,
NO KIDS.

01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:09.542
I GUESS WE'RE IT.

01:29:26.792 --> 01:29:27.959
ROSE.

01:29:30.792 --> 01:29:33.291
ROSE...

01:29:33.375 --> 01:29:35.250
BEFORE YOU GO, I...

01:30:07.959 --> 01:30:11.667
WE COULD HAVE BEEN
GREAT TOGETHER.

01:30:19.959 --> 01:30:23.583
I--I'LL GO BACK IN AND SEE
IF I FORGOT ANYTHING.

01:30:23.667 --> 01:30:25.000
OH.

01:30:29.333 --> 01:30:31.500
OH, COME ON.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.250
WAIT HERE, OK?

01:30:36.333 --> 01:30:40.500
I'M GOING
TO GO HELP MOM.

01:30:45.458 --> 01:30:46.875
AH, CASEY,
DO ME A FAVOR.

01:30:46.959 --> 01:30:48.750
GIVE ME THE KEYS
TO YOUR CRUISER,
WILL YOU?

01:30:48.834 --> 01:30:50.208
YEAH,
NO PROBLEM, DAN.

01:30:50.291 --> 01:30:51.375
THANKS, MAN.

01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:52.667
YEAH.

01:31:04.208 --> 01:31:06.250
YOU KNOW, DANNY...

01:31:06.333 --> 01:31:09.125
I'M ACTUALLY GOING
TO MISS THIS HOUSE.

01:31:09.208 --> 01:31:11.792
YEAH.

01:31:11.875 --> 01:31:16.000
WELL, THERE'S NO POINT
IN GETTING ALL
TEARY-EYED ABOUT IT.

01:31:16.083 --> 01:31:17.667
GET YOUR BAGS.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

01:31:26.041 --> 01:31:27.291
WHAT'S KEEPING YOU?

01:31:27.375 --> 01:31:28.709
WE'LL MISS THE PLANE.

01:31:30.542 --> 01:31:33.291
I'M NOT GOING
WITH YOU, MA.

01:31:33.375 --> 01:31:34.458
WHAT?

01:31:34.542 --> 01:31:37.291
IT HIT ME YESTERDAY
AT THE FUNERAL.

01:31:37.375 --> 01:31:39.250
IF I GO WITH YOU
TO FLORIDA,

01:31:39.333 --> 01:31:44.333
I'D BE LEAVING BEHIND
THE BEST THING THAT
EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

01:31:44.417 --> 01:31:46.000
IF IT'S NOT TOO LATE,

01:31:46.083 --> 01:31:48.291
I'M GOING TO TRY
TO GET HER BACK.

01:31:48.375 --> 01:31:51.041
SO YOU'RE SENDING ME
OFF TO FLORIDA ALONE.

01:31:51.125 --> 01:31:52.166
NO.

01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:53.834
MA, AUNT JEAN
AND UNCLE WALTER,

01:31:53.917 --> 01:31:56.041
THEY'RE GOING TO MEET YOU
AT THE AIRPORT.

01:31:56.125 --> 01:31:57.458
UNCLE WALTER.

01:31:57.542 --> 01:31:59.125
HE'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO LOOK UNDER ME SKIRT

01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:00.625
WHEN I CROSS MY LEGS.

01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:02.583
MA, COME ON, PLEASE.

01:32:04.375 --> 01:32:06.792
VERY WELL.

01:32:06.875 --> 01:32:09.125
FINE.

01:32:09.208 --> 01:32:11.667
WHO NEEDS YOU ANYWAY?

01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:13.000
MA.

01:32:13.083 --> 01:32:14.834
MA.

01:32:14.917 --> 01:32:16.208
I'M AN OLD WOMAN.

01:32:16.291 --> 01:32:18.208
I CAN'T BE EXPECTED
TO WAIT ON YOU

01:32:18.291 --> 01:32:20.625
HAND AND FOOT FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:21.959
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF DOING YOUR LAUNDRY,

01:32:22.041 --> 01:32:23.709
IRONING YOUR SHIRTS,
COOKING YOUR MEALS.

01:32:23.792 --> 01:32:26.959
I'VE LOST GALLONS OF SWEAT
AND BUCKETS OF BLOOD,

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.917
ALL FOR YOU.

01:32:30.959 --> 01:32:33.667
YOU'VE BEEN NOTHING
BUT A BALL AND CHAIN

01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:37.208
OF HEARTACHE AND HURT
HANGING AROUND MY NECK

01:32:37.291 --> 01:32:40.583
FOR TOO MANY
GODFORSAKEN YEARS.

01:32:40.667 --> 01:32:43.792
IT'LL BE GOOD
RIDDANCE TO YOU.

01:33:01.959 --> 01:33:03.875
I'M SORRY, DANNY.

01:33:03.959 --> 01:33:05.583
THAT'S OK, MA.

01:33:05.667 --> 01:33:08.333
YOU WERE JUST
TELLING IT
LIKE IT IS.

01:33:08.417 --> 01:33:10.875
NO, DANNY.

01:33:10.959 --> 01:33:12.417
I WAS LYING.

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.250
TELLING IT LIKE IT IS

01:33:14.333 --> 01:33:17.041
WOULD HURT TOO MUCH
RIGHT NOW.

01:33:31.125 --> 01:33:34.208
GO. MARRY THAT GIRL.

01:33:34.291 --> 01:33:37.250
HAVE LOTS
OF IRISH-DAGO MUTTS,

01:33:37.333 --> 01:33:39.417
AND, EVERY ONCE
IN A WHILE,

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.834
BRING THEM TO FLORIDA
TO SEE THEIR GRANDMOTHER.

01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:46.458
I LOVE YOU, MA.

01:33:48.125 --> 01:33:50.458
I'M NOT SO LOVABLE.

01:33:50.542 --> 01:33:51.917
TRUE ENOUGH.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.709
I'M KIDDING.

01:34:27.083 --> 01:34:28.083
DANNY.

01:34:28.166 --> 01:34:29.834
YEAH?

01:34:29.917 --> 01:34:31.250
SHE'S GONE.

01:34:31.333 --> 01:34:32.500
NEW YORK.

01:34:32.583 --> 01:34:34.375
3:15 TRAIN.

01:34:34.458 --> 01:34:36.083
OH, DAMN.

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:50.375
[SIREN]

01:34:50.458 --> 01:34:52.333
LOIS, THIS IS
DANNY MULDOON.

01:34:52.417 --> 01:34:53.500
YEAH, DANNY.

01:34:53.583 --> 01:34:55.000
GET ME FREDDIE NUNZIO
AT UNION STATION

01:34:55.083 --> 01:34:56.000
AND HURRY.

01:34:56.083 --> 01:34:57.083
10-4.

01:35:23.792 --> 01:35:27.041
JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH!

01:35:27.125 --> 01:35:30.208
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:32.041
DANNY GAVE ME HIS TICKET.

01:35:32.125 --> 01:35:35.709
THE THOUGHT OF YOU
TRAVELING TO FLORIDA
ALL ALONE...

01:35:35.792 --> 01:35:37.709
NEARLY BROKE MY HEART.

01:35:37.792 --> 01:35:39.792
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

01:35:43.792 --> 01:35:46.291
A KISS BEFORE TAKEOFF?

01:35:48.166 --> 01:35:50.208
FORGET IT.

01:35:50.291 --> 01:35:52.417
I'M GOING TO SLEEP.

01:35:54.166 --> 01:35:58.291
WELL, AT LAST, WE GET
TO SLEEP TOGETHER.

01:36:31.041 --> 01:36:33.875
FOLKS, WE HAVE TO MAKE
AN UNSCHEDULED STOP HERE.

01:36:33.959 --> 01:36:36.709
THERE'S GOING TO BE
A BIT OF A DELAY.

01:36:36.792 --> 01:36:38.125
FOR SECURITY REASONS,

01:36:38.208 --> 01:36:41.125
EVERYONE WILL HAVE
TO DEBOARD THE TRAIN.

01:36:41.208 --> 01:36:43.417
WE'RE SORRY
FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.166
THANK YOU.

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:56.333
THERESA!

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.208
HI.

01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:10.917
YOU DID ALL THIS,
DIDN'T YOU?

01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:14.875
SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD
TO BE A COP.

01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:20.500
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:37:20.583 --> 01:37:23.041
ALL ABOARD!

01:37:23.125 --> 01:37:25.500
I--I--I...

01:37:25.583 --> 01:37:28.000
I JUST WANT--

01:37:28.083 --> 01:37:29.375
I--I...

01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:33.166
DON'T YOU HATE ALL
THE UNCOMFORTABLE STUFF

01:37:33.250 --> 01:37:34.792
THAT GOES WITH TRYING
TO ASK SOMEBODY

01:37:34.875 --> 01:37:37.834
TO GET BACK
TOGETHER WITH YOU?

01:37:37.917 --> 01:37:39.500
I'LL MAKE IT EASY
FOR YOU.

01:37:39.583 --> 01:37:41.000
I'LL GIVE YOU
A LIST OF EXCUSES.

01:37:41.083 --> 01:37:43.750
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS ANSWER YES OR NO, OK?

01:37:45.583 --> 01:37:47.166
GOOD.

01:37:47.250 --> 01:37:48.875
HERE GOES.

01:37:48.959 --> 01:37:52.333
REASONS WHY YOU AND I
CAN'T GET BACK TOGETHER--

01:37:52.417 --> 01:37:53.792
YOU'RE SEEING
SOMEBODY ELSE.

01:37:53.875 --> 01:37:55.625
NO.

01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:57.458
YOU'RE MOVING
INTO A CONVENT.

01:37:57.542 --> 01:37:59.166
NO.

01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:00.750
YOU'RE HAVING
YOUR LEGS WAXED?

01:38:03.291 --> 01:38:04.917
NO.

01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:11.291
YOU'VE FALLEN
OUT OF LOVE WITH ME.

01:38:13.625 --> 01:38:15.417
NO.

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.917
NO?

01:38:20.125 --> 01:38:21.917
NO.

01:38:24.125 --> 01:38:25.667
THAT'S GREAT.

01:38:27.333 --> 01:38:28.667
MAY-MAYBE, UH...

01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:30.667
YOU AND ME, WE SHOULD--

01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:32.250
YOU FORGOT ONE THING.

01:38:32.333 --> 01:38:33.291
WHAT?

01:38:35.125 --> 01:38:36.166
YOUR MOTHER.

01:38:36.250 --> 01:38:37.667
SHE'S GONE.

01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:39.750
TO FLORIDA?

01:38:39.834 --> 01:38:41.291
SHE'S ON A PLANE.

01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:44.250
SO HOW DO I KNOW

01:38:44.333 --> 01:38:46.083
YOU WON'T HOP A FLIGHT
TO BE WITH HER

01:38:46.166 --> 01:38:47.959
TOMORROW OR NEXT WEEK
OR NEXT MONTH?

01:38:48.041 --> 01:38:50.709
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE
WHO LET HER GO...

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.667
AND I'M READY
TO PUT US FIRST.

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:01.125
FINAL BOARDING CALL
FOR ALL PASSENGERS

01:39:01.208 --> 01:39:03.417
TRAVELING
TO NEW YORK CITY!

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.208
COME ON.

01:39:05.291 --> 01:39:06.458
WHERE?

01:39:06.542 --> 01:39:08.417
WELL, WE'RE BOARDING.

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.250
YOU'RE GOING
TO NEW YORK?

01:39:10.333 --> 01:39:11.792
I KNOW THIS POLICE
SERGEANT IN THE BRONX.

01:39:11.875 --> 01:39:13.291
HE TRANSFERRED
FROM CHICAGO.

01:39:13.375 --> 01:39:15.083
MAYBE HE CAN PULL
A FEW STRINGS, YOU KNOW?

01:39:15.166 --> 01:39:16.583
GIVE ME A LINE
ON A JOB.

01:39:16.667 --> 01:39:18.208
YOU'D DO THAT?

01:39:18.291 --> 01:39:21.083
YOU'D LEAVE
