WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:04.526
ADULT ADAM: The '80s was the peak of the sports comedy,

00:04.569 --> 00:06.615
and my favorite,
Major League.

00:06.658 --> 00:09.705
I loved the classic underdog
story of a team of misfits

00:09.748 --> 00:12.882
who used questionable
methods and voodoo
to become champions.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.710
They actually make
sports tolerable

00:14.753 --> 00:16.712
with their on-field
shenanigans.

00:16.755 --> 00:19.758
And Barry loved the unhinged, badass pitcher, "Wild Thing."

00:19.802 --> 00:23.719
Dude, Wild Thing can't control
his rage or his fastball.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.068
That's just like me.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.765
ADULT ADAM: Yep,
there was nothing better
than rooting

00:26.809 --> 00:28.637
for the ragtag team
with the evil owner.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.942
You want us to lose?

00:29.986 --> 00:33.337
What I want is for us
to finish dead last.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.209
ADULT ADAM:
And then one day,
Major League

00:35.252 --> 00:36.558
became a major reality.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.168
You wanted to see me, Earl?

00:38.212 --> 00:40.475
Ah, there's
my favorite shop teacher.

00:40.518 --> 00:41.693
We should
cut the chitchat.

00:41.737 --> 00:43.652
I have 63 birdhouses
to grade.

00:43.695 --> 00:46.959
See, that is just
the kind of statement
that leads me to believe

00:47.003 --> 00:49.310
you're the perfect man
to help me out.With?

00:49.353 --> 00:51.921
I want to get rid of
the baseball team.Sure.

00:51.964 --> 00:54.315
See, Coach Mellor's departure
has left the team in shambles.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.446
Sure.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.927
They're so bad
that even the school paper

00:57.970 --> 01:00.147
has stopped trying
to spin the losses.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.497
If our team keeps playing
like hot garbage,

01:02.540 --> 01:05.456
I could convince the board
to drop the program

01:05.500 --> 01:08.416
and spend that money
fixing our budgeting issues.Sure.

01:08.459 --> 01:11.158
Which is why you're gonna
be our new baseball coach.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.247
What? I don't know anything
about the game.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.379
A-All I played growing up
were timber sports.

01:15.423 --> 01:16.511
Timber sports?

01:16.554 --> 01:18.121
Log rolling,
speed felling,

01:18.165 --> 01:19.470
speed whittling,
speed sanding.

01:19.514 --> 01:22.473
Yeah, you help me lose and
that absurd radial arm saw

01:22.517 --> 01:25.259
you've been requesting
is all yours.Batter up.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.565
I have taken the liberty
of tracking down

01:27.609 --> 01:29.437
some new recruits
for the team.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.395
They all
happen to be students

01:31.439 --> 01:34.137
who have been dodging
their athletic requirements,

01:34.181 --> 01:36.574
if you catch my drift.
Good luck.

01:36.618 --> 01:39.229
ADULT ADAM: And with that, Mr. Crosby set out to assemble

01:39.273 --> 01:41.275
the worst high-school team
of all time.

01:41.318 --> 01:43.451
Would you look at that?
My shoes are untied.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.801
Better lace these up
before I trip.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.803
That is a wrap on
whatever the hell this is.

01:47.846 --> 01:49.631
Get your hands and feet
to the gym, boys.

01:49.674 --> 01:52.373
All right,
you've died of dysentery.
Time to play sports.

01:52.416 --> 01:53.722
Can I save my...
Go! Get your ass
to the gym.

01:53.765 --> 01:54.940
Go, go, go,
go, go, go.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.768
Come with me, Dave Kim.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.074
Is this about my birdhouse?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.945
I need an extension.

01:59.989 --> 02:02.122
David Sirota, Jessie Wudders,
stop playing
pretend government

02:02.165 --> 02:03.601
and start playing
real baseball.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.516
But I-I only own
penny loafers.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.952
This is gonna be
easier than I thought.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.650
ADULT ADAM: Needless to say,

02:08.693 --> 02:10.826
my brother wasn't thrilled
with our team's new rookies.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.088
I don't get it.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.221
We haven't won a game
all season.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.310
Now they're hamstringing us
with you turds?

02:16.353 --> 02:18.094
Hey, we don't
wanna be here either.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.965
And what are you wearing?

02:20.009 --> 02:22.968
Coach was a uniform short,
so I'm wearing my costume
from Damn Yankees.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.101
Adam, today is
my first pitching start,

02:25.145 --> 02:26.885
and they are
not gonna ruin it.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.671
Relax.
We're just here to satisfy
our sports requirement.

02:29.714 --> 02:31.847
There's no chance Coach
will ever put us in.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.414
Okay, listen up, team.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.459
There's been some changes
to the starting lineup.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.200
Shortstop... Dave Kim.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.810
No!

02:38.854 --> 02:41.465
He's, like, the worst Dave Kim
of all the Dave Kims.

02:41.509 --> 02:42.771
CROSBY: Moving on.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.468
Playing right field,
Adam Goldberg.

02:44.512 --> 02:45.774
What?

02:45.817 --> 02:48.864
He's got a lazy eye
and the body to match.

02:48.907 --> 02:51.649
Normally, I'd object
but I'm desperate here.

02:51.693 --> 02:54.826
Look at it.
These eyes cannot
catch a baseball.

02:54.870 --> 02:57.960
Oh, God. Put back on
the corrective lenses,
man. Please.

02:58.961 --> 03:00.571
♪ Wild thing ♪

03:04.096 --> 03:05.968
ADULT ADAM:
It was January 30,
1980-something,

03:06.011 --> 03:07.970
a landmark day for Gerica.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.059
Happy Kissa-versary.

03:10.102 --> 03:12.104
Here are some tulips
to celebrate the day

03:12.148 --> 03:14.019
these two lips first kissed
those two lips.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.804
Ew. But also aww.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.109
And wait, there's more.

03:17.153 --> 03:19.155
I also booked us a romantic
getaway to the Poconos.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.852
Poconos?

03:20.896 --> 03:23.072
That's our most scenic
and budget-friendly
mountain range.

03:23.115 --> 03:24.726
You know it.
Get packing, lady.

03:24.769 --> 03:26.467
This is amazing.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.599
The two of us, alone.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.732
How did you convince
your dad to say yes?

03:30.775 --> 03:32.908
Oh, it was easy.
Uh, mostly because
I haven't done it yet.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.605
But I have a foolproof plan.

03:34.649 --> 03:35.432
I'm going to lie to him.

03:36.999 --> 03:38.870
Well, this was a fun ride.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.220
I'll just rent us a movie.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.178
Oh, come on. What,
are you implying
I can't lie?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.440
I can lie.
I lie all the time.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.181
You really don't.
And when you do,

03:45.225 --> 03:47.183
you bail immediately
and then overcompensate

03:47.227 --> 03:49.054
by revealing
a deeply personal secret

03:49.098 --> 03:50.534
that nobody wants to know.

03:50.578 --> 03:53.363
Surely you're
thinking of some other
unskilled liar.

03:53.407 --> 03:55.104
Hey, Mom,
Geoff has some thoughts

03:55.147 --> 03:56.758
on your new
Jazzercise ensemble

03:56.801 --> 03:58.194
that he wants
to share with you.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.283
Ah, don't you just love it,
Geoffrey?

04:00.327 --> 04:02.198
The Lycra is form-fitting,

04:02.242 --> 04:03.895
but it still gives me
the freedom

04:03.939 --> 04:05.419
to explore all my moves.

04:05.462 --> 04:08.335
Uh, well, I suppose
I enjoy the bold colors

04:08.378 --> 04:10.554
and the sleeve
length and...
Oh, my God.

04:10.598 --> 04:11.990
Also, one time
at summer camp,

04:12.034 --> 04:14.123
I took a puff of a cigar
and then it made me
really nauseous

04:14.166 --> 04:15.472
and I threw up in a lake.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.387
And there it is.

04:17.431 --> 04:20.564
ADULT ADAM: And so it was
up to my sister to concoct
the perfect lie.

04:20.608 --> 04:24.220
The Eastern Pennsylvania
Scholastic Achievement Awards?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.570
That's fantastic,
but it doesn't surprise me

04:26.614 --> 04:28.442
my Geoffrey is
receiving such an honor.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.226
Well, it's really
an award for you, too.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.401
You raised a smarty.

04:31.445 --> 04:32.794
Take some videos.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.491
Okay, well,
we'll see ya when we see ya.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.885
ADULT ADAM: While Erica
and Geoff lied their way
to a dream weekend,

04:36.928 --> 04:39.191
I was living a true nightmare.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.541
Please don't let
the ball come to me.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.456
Please. Oh, balls.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.936
I-I don't got it!
I don't got it!

04:44.980 --> 04:46.286
I definitely don't got it!

04:47.722 --> 04:49.767
Turns out,
our underdog team

04:49.811 --> 04:52.466
wasn't as bad as the one
inMajor League.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.945
No, we were worse.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.906
I'm as mad at me
as you are.

04:57.949 --> 05:00.909
Boys are looking lousy
out there, Crosby.
Good coaching.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.869
Whoa.
Kremp can actually play.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.784
Yeah, that's on me.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.090
Kid was making
a weird movie
with Goldberg.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.483
I made some assumptions.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.528
Kremp, you're benched
for showboating.

05:11.572 --> 05:12.355
Penny loafer, you're in.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.489
In my defense,
I have cleats,

05:15.532 --> 05:16.707
but you insisted
I wear these.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.274
CROSBY: Uh-huh.
Move it, penny loafer.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.624
Can I just stand
in the grass area?
They're getting all dusty.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.931
Yeah, you do
what you need to do, kid.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.715
ADULT ADAM: And the cherry
on top of our suck sundae,

05:24.759 --> 05:26.543
my brother's pitching.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.546
Just a bit outside.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.506
Ball four.

05:32.549 --> 05:33.855
Ball eight.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.335
Honestly, I've lost count.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.644
ADULT ADAM: I just couldn't
stop wondering why
Crosby and Ball

05:40.688 --> 05:43.778
didn't seem to care that our team was so epically bad.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.562
And then it hit me.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.306
The ball just punched me.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.264
They wanted us to lose,
like inMajor League.

05:52.308 --> 05:55.659
Meanwhile, my sister was
on a major romantic getaway.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.531
You know, I gotta admit,

05:57.574 --> 05:59.054
the whole time
you were lying to my dad,

05:59.097 --> 06:01.883
I had this feeling
that something terrible
was gonna happen.

06:01.926 --> 06:04.451
Stick with me, Schwartz.
I'll never lead you wrong.

06:07.715 --> 06:08.759
Oh, my God!

06:11.675 --> 06:13.329
ADULT ADAM: Yep,
this is 100% true.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.288
My oldest sibling snuck off
on a romantic getaway

06:16.332 --> 06:18.639
and actually did this
to my dad's car.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.078
Oh, God!
What are we gonna do?

06:23.121 --> 06:25.994
Cars don't just fall
off cliffs at scholastic
award shows!

06:26.037 --> 06:27.256
Forget the awards!

06:27.299 --> 06:28.910
My dad's car
just rolled off a cliff!

06:28.953 --> 06:30.651
Oh, my dad's gonna kill me!

06:30.694 --> 06:33.218
Please make sure
some nice lady gets
my eyes! Promise me!

06:33.262 --> 06:34.437
Okay, let's just take
a deep breath

06:34.481 --> 06:36.700
of the fresh mountain air
and think.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.920
I lied my way
into this mess.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.661
I can lie my way
out of it.

06:40.704 --> 06:43.141
And just as
the scholastic gala
was ending,

06:43.185 --> 06:46.449
Geoff and I walked outside
and found a sack
of abandoned puppies.

06:46.493 --> 06:49.104
Naturally, we raced the car
to the animal hospital,

06:49.147 --> 06:51.585
but there was
a drawbridge being raised

06:51.628 --> 06:53.717
and we tried to jump it
for the puppies

06:53.761 --> 06:56.111
because we're good people,
but the car didn't make it.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.375
Luckily, we're fine

06:59.419 --> 07:00.811
and so were
the two dozen puppies

07:00.855 --> 07:02.247
that have now
all found homes.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.467
Drawbridges are death ramps.

07:04.511 --> 07:07.514
My nail girl's brother
tried to jump a drawbridge.

07:07.557 --> 07:10.560
They found
his head and torso
on a fishing trawler.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.607
He's in culinary school now,
but every day is a struggle.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.304
Thank God
the two of you
were not hurt.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.523
It's a lie.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.525
We were in the Poconos
on a secret getaway.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.744
We parked your station
wagon on the hill without
the parking brake,

07:20.788 --> 07:22.529
and also I copied part of
my Bar Mitzvah speech

07:22.572 --> 07:24.487
from a Winston Churchill
biography.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.750
So you lied
right to my face,
Geoffy?

07:26.794 --> 07:29.057
Wait, no. It...
It's not Geoff's fault.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.712
It's all mine,
and I'm so sorry.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.365
ADULT ADAM: And then
my sister braced herself

07:33.409 --> 07:35.193
for a nuclear Murray meltdown.

07:36.978 --> 07:39.720
You sent my car off a cliff!

07:39.763 --> 07:41.504
Wow, he's taking this
really well.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.332
I figured that he would be
screaming his head off.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.290
Off a cliff!
Who does that?

07:45.334 --> 07:48.511
Oh, no.
Your father has reached
a stage beyond anger.

07:48.555 --> 07:51.645
All my family does
is wreck my car!

07:51.688 --> 07:53.255
Third time this year!

07:53.298 --> 07:55.170
Oh, this is not good.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.301
The Poconos.

07:56.345 --> 07:57.564
You could've been killed.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.696
To be honest,
I'm digging this way more

07:59.740 --> 08:01.219
than the screaming
and the "moron" calling.

08:01.263 --> 08:04.571
My insurance is
gonna go through the roof!

08:04.614 --> 08:06.486
Okay, I got to get him inside
and try to calm him down

08:06.529 --> 08:07.791
with warm milk
and Steak-umms.

08:07.835 --> 08:10.359
I don't know if it'll work,
but I'm a desperate woman.

08:10.402 --> 08:14.668
Anyway, I-I'm sorry about
the bending the truth thing.

08:14.711 --> 08:15.712
It probably
won't happen again.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.584
The only reason Geoff
is in this mess

08:17.627 --> 08:19.281
is because of
your terrible influence,

08:19.324 --> 08:21.370
and it stops now.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.937
This relationship is over.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.983
What?
Y-You can't break up
with my girlfriend.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.550
W-Wait, can you? Can he?

08:27.594 --> 08:29.552
I don't know.
I've never been in
this situation before.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.207
Let's go, son.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.948
ADULT ADAM: While Erica's lies had finally caught up to her,

08:33.991 --> 08:37.386
I was catching up the guys
on my major revelation.

08:37.429 --> 08:40.215
Gentlemen, Principal Ball
and Mr. Crosby

08:40.258 --> 08:42.913
are Major Leagueing
this team.What?

08:42.957 --> 08:45.699
Just one glaring problem
with your theory.

08:45.742 --> 08:48.615
If he wanted us to lose,
they'd never let me pitch.

08:48.658 --> 08:51.313
Barry, he let you pitch
because of how bad you are.

08:51.356 --> 08:52.923
Adam. A word?

08:52.967 --> 08:55.709
Just between us,
the last thing I would want

08:55.752 --> 08:57.928
is for me to seem weak
in front of the team,

08:57.972 --> 09:01.279
but what you just said
about my pitching
hurt me to the core.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.629
Uh, bro?

09:02.672 --> 09:04.456
We can hear
everything you're saying.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.588
You're, like,
not that far away.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.244
I'm sorry.

09:09.287 --> 09:10.680
I just thought
it was important
you all know the truth.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.900
But I don't suck.

09:12.943 --> 09:15.076
I'm literally gonna
cry right now.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.991
Guys, it's not so much
a distance thing

09:17.034 --> 09:19.428
as a volume thing, 'cause
we're getting every word.

09:19.471 --> 09:22.300
Damn it!
I'll prove how good
I am right now!

09:22.344 --> 09:23.432
Who's got a ball?

09:23.475 --> 09:24.781
I've got a tangerine.

09:24.825 --> 09:27.523
But it's supposed to be
for emergency dips
in my blood sugar.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.481
This is an emergency.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.614
What are you doing?
I'm gonna throw

09:31.658 --> 09:33.747
this little embarrassing
emergency orange at you

09:33.790 --> 09:36.010
so you can feel
how much I don't suck.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.929
Dude. We're being Major League'd.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.670
What are we gonna do?
I'll tell you what.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.759
We're gonna Major League
'em right back.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.543
'Cause in the end,
it turns out

09:47.587 --> 09:49.850
that ragtag bunch
of losers win it all!

09:49.893 --> 09:51.547
And so will we!

09:51.591 --> 09:55.029
Or we put all our faith
in our amazing pitcher

09:55.072 --> 09:56.683
to take us
to the championship.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.119
Wild Thing.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.381
Look alive,
Shernicke.

10:00.991 --> 10:03.777
Okay, we can just go
with his thing.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.999
ADULT ADAM:
Even though Earl Ball
wanted us to lose,

10:09.043 --> 10:12.089
I'd use my favorite
sports movie to help us win.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.919
Okay, our Major Leaguejourney
from underdog scrubs

10:15.963 --> 10:18.356
to skilled champions
begins with one thing.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.925
Meet Jobu, the idol
that Pedro Cerrano prays to

10:21.969 --> 10:23.710
that helps you hit
the curve ball.

10:23.753 --> 10:27.496
Uh, bro? That doll seems
a little super insensitive.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.454
He's hilarious in the movie,

10:29.498 --> 10:31.848
but presenting it now
just makes me feel
kinda weird.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.241
Y-Yeah, I'd...
I'd put it away.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.808
Okay, we're gonna lose.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.505
Not if we have
a sexy incentive
for us to win.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.072
Aw, yeah,
like in the movie.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.551
Whenever the Indians
would win,

10:39.595 --> 10:42.163
they would remove
a sliver of clothing from
a cardboard cutout

10:42.206 --> 10:44.382
of the team's super hot
yet evil owner.

10:44.426 --> 10:47.995
Which is why
I made a cardboard
cutout of our nemesis,

10:48.038 --> 10:50.040
school principal
and avid swimmer,
Earl Ball.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.916
Relax.
We're only gonna
take a piece off

10:55.959 --> 10:57.091
when we don't win.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.440
This team shall never
lose again.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.268
We can't let it
happen, guys.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.487
For sure! But also, where did
you get that picture?

11:02.531 --> 11:04.359
Finally,
we have to band together

11:04.402 --> 11:05.882
and address
each of our weaknesses.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.362
Like in the movie

11:07.405 --> 11:10.147
when the team had to convince
Wild Thing to wear glasses.

11:10.191 --> 11:13.150
Bro, I-I think someone would
know if they needed glasses.

11:13.194 --> 11:16.197
Not to be this guy,
but we're all painfully aware

11:16.240 --> 11:18.416
that you're super nearsighted
but refuse to acknowledge it.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.114
I can see just fine.

11:20.157 --> 11:22.464
I'll prove it.
I'll read your shirt.
"Spice Inventors."

11:22.507 --> 11:24.118
ALL: No.
"Spork Investors"?

11:24.161 --> 11:25.815
No.
"Shark Incisors"?

11:25.859 --> 11:28.296
ALL: No.
"Snake Inhalers." Yeah?

11:28.339 --> 11:29.776
Nope.
"Spanish Inquisition"?

11:29.819 --> 11:31.865
No, that's...
"Saint Ignatius"?

11:31.908 --> 11:32.779
What?
How have you
made it this far?

11:32.822 --> 11:34.171
"Spare Bedroom"?
No.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.390
"Spanakopita"?

11:35.433 --> 11:36.739
Here.
I'm nearsighted, too.

11:38.480 --> 11:42.092
Oh, it's "Space Invaders."

11:42.136 --> 11:43.659
That makes sense.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.792
So you're finally admitting
to yourself that you need
glasses?

11:45.835 --> 11:48.751
I've always known!
I can't believe
you all knew

11:48.795 --> 11:49.839
and never cared enough
to tell me.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.146
Why?

11:52.189 --> 11:53.800
I'll get us each
a new pair.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.324
ADULT ADAM: Yep, our team
was ready to end
our losing streak,

11:56.367 --> 11:59.240
and Erica was determined
to win over Geoff's dad.

11:59.283 --> 12:02.591
Thank you, Dr. Schwartz, for
joining us today in your home.

12:02.634 --> 12:05.899
We've all heard some murmurs
that I'm not "good enough"
for Geoff.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.901
What's happening right now?
You may think you know

12:07.944 --> 12:09.337
the whole story
of Geoff and Erica,

12:09.380 --> 12:12.644
but do you really know
Geoff and Erica?Yes.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.342
But I think once you see
my presentation,

12:14.385 --> 12:15.735
you'll see that
I'm the perfect
girl for Geoff.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.914
Long before
I was a free spirit

12:20.957 --> 12:23.481
who treated life
as one big party,

12:23.525 --> 12:26.136
I actually used to be
a doofy bookworm

12:26.180 --> 12:28.225
who went to bed by 9:00,
just like Geoff here.

12:28.269 --> 12:29.966
So you think
my son is a doof?

12:30.010 --> 12:32.012
Uh, Geoff, you wanna
maybe jump in here

12:32.055 --> 12:33.970
and talk about our love?
You bet.

12:34.014 --> 12:36.407
Erica's a great influence
on me.

12:36.451 --> 12:37.539
Are you drinking a beer?

12:37.582 --> 12:39.584
Moving on.

12:39.628 --> 12:42.413
Look. Last week,
she took me mini golfing
for half-price Tuesdays.

12:42.457 --> 12:43.675
But Tuesday's a school day.

12:43.719 --> 12:44.807
Moving on.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.766
See, Erica's
really thoughtful, Dad.

12:46.809 --> 12:47.854
She threw me
a surprise party,

12:47.897 --> 12:49.464
and it was
the best night of my life.

12:49.507 --> 12:50.813
Is that my living room?

12:50.857 --> 12:53.729
Did you throw a party
when I was in Miami?

12:53.773 --> 12:54.861
Erica,
please take over again.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.688
No! I've had enough.

12:56.732 --> 12:57.951
This just confirms
what I already knew.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.300
You may love my son,

12:59.343 --> 13:02.042
but it doesn't mean
you're good for him.I'm .

13:02.085 --> 13:04.261
ADULT ADAM: As Erica's
apology project fell apart,

13:04.305 --> 13:07.221
our team's bigMajor League
plan was coming together.

13:07.264 --> 13:09.049
How's it going, Coach?

13:09.092 --> 13:11.312
Are we gonna win
at sucking or what?

13:11.355 --> 13:12.748
Got my worst men
on it, sir.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.187
Strike!
Three, three!

13:18.710 --> 13:20.016
Yes!

13:20.060 --> 13:23.106
Two down, two down.
Play's at second.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.892
They can play
and know the lingo.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.110
It seems
they've figured out

13:27.154 --> 13:28.503
that you're
Major Leagueingthem

13:28.546 --> 13:30.679
and now they're
Major Leagueingyou back.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.550
Unless we
change the schedule.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.335
We have to play
Meadowbrook High?

13:34.378 --> 13:35.205
They're the best team
in the city.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.859
This is bad.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.079
Ball knows we know
he's Major Leagueingus

13:39.122 --> 13:40.776
and that we're
Major Leagueinghim back.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.300
I'm confused,
but ready to act with anger.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.520
Good. 'Cause now we're at
the top of our game,

13:45.563 --> 13:46.913
and nothing can
bring us down.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.610
Well, look who it is.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.264
It's the JTP,

13:50.307 --> 13:52.483
AKA the Jenkintown Posers.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.834
You know that's not
what it stands for, bro!

13:54.877 --> 13:56.705
Balls, balls,
this just got bad fast.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.402
It was the Meadowbrook Mafia,

13:58.446 --> 14:01.362
the JTP's rival posse
from one town over,

14:01.405 --> 14:05.540
and they were led by theater
star and hotshot athlete
Bradley Cooper.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.325
Word on the suburban street is
the baseball schedule changed

14:08.369 --> 14:11.720
and now we get to
destroy you on Friday.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.069
Doesn't matter
who we play,

14:13.113 --> 14:14.854
'cause as long as
I'm pitching,

14:14.897 --> 14:17.465
we're guaranteed the "W."

14:17.508 --> 14:19.293
Can't wait to see you
on the mound, four-eyes.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.772
Shows what you know.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.818
I'm pitching,
not my nerd brother.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.733
No, you're
the four-eyed nerd.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.169
I can't wait
to hit your first pitch

14:26.213 --> 14:28.998
all the way
to the school library.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.565
Where you'll probably find it
the next day,

14:30.608 --> 14:32.697
because you have glasses

14:32.741 --> 14:34.786
and thus an uncool love
of reading.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.311
Well, I'll have you know
Barry never reads.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.008
He's more of a TV guy.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.663
"I have glasses,
and I'm a Dork Lord."

14:44.057 --> 14:47.016
They just called me
a four-eyed nerdling.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.975
That's so hurtful.

14:49.018 --> 14:52.326
Who talks to people like that
just because they wear
corrective lenses?

14:52.369 --> 14:55.068
You? Almost every
single day of my life?

14:55.111 --> 14:57.244
Well, yeah, 'cause you're
a four-eyed nerdling...

14:57.287 --> 15:00.334
Oh, no!

15:00.377 --> 15:01.857
I get it now!

15:01.901 --> 15:05.078
You're just now getting
that being called a nerd
is hurtful?

15:05.121 --> 15:07.341
Yes. Now that
I'm affected,
I care.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.734
Great. 'Cause we actually
have a chance

15:09.778 --> 15:11.432
to stand up
and fight back.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.781
No, guys...

15:12.824 --> 15:14.174
I can't wear these things.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.437
What's the worst
that happens?

15:16.480 --> 15:19.353
Look, there's a reason
I refused to admit
I needed these things.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.572
Yeah, I act all cool,
but I'm not.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.705
And these glasses
will just make it worse.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.750
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.277
ADULT ADAM: Turns out
my overconfident brother

15:30.320 --> 15:32.018
was more insecure
than I thought.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.237
And while glasses
made Barry quit the team,

15:34.281 --> 15:36.413
Geoff was determined
to see Erica,

15:36.457 --> 15:38.024
no matter how risky.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.200
Gah! Geoff,
what are you doing?

15:40.243 --> 15:41.810
I'll stop at nothing
to see you!

15:41.853 --> 15:44.552
That's sweet, but you could've
just used the front door.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.380
It's your dad who doesn't
want us together.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.904
Oh, God, I'm so upset
I'm not thinking straight.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.254
Relax. You're forgetting
that I have parents, too.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.865
And once Beverly Goldberg
hears that your dad

15:53.909 --> 15:55.737
called her baby girl
a bad influence,

15:55.780 --> 15:57.391
she'll unleash
such unbridled fury

15:57.434 --> 15:59.088
that your dad will wish
he was in that car.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.265
Yeah, not my place.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.006
Not your place?

16:04.050 --> 16:06.400
Everywhere's your place!
You have no boundaries!

16:06.443 --> 16:09.055
Schmoo, how do I
put this delicately?

16:09.098 --> 16:10.839
We agree with Lou.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.667
You're a horrible influence
on the boy.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.930
What? You're supposed
to be on my side.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.237
Oh, how do I put this
delicately?

16:17.280 --> 16:20.370
Geoff is a college-bound
future doctor.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.720
You're a drop-out liar
who can't even hold a job.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.853
Would you just let her put it
delicately one time?

16:24.896 --> 16:26.333
Look, Erica,

16:26.376 --> 16:28.291
we don't think you're
not good enough for Geoff.

16:28.335 --> 16:29.901
It's just that, right now,

16:29.945 --> 16:32.730
it seems Geoff
is too good for you.

16:32.774 --> 16:35.124
Thank you, Mom.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.604
Wait. That's exactly
the same thing.

16:36.647 --> 16:39.128
You just said it in
a nicer tone.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.260
ADULT ADAM:
For the first time,

16:40.303 --> 16:42.610
my mom said no
to defending her kids

16:42.653 --> 16:44.133
and then felt so bad,
she caved.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.178
Hey.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.442
Wanna talk about it?

16:48.485 --> 16:50.357
Everyone was right.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.489
Geoff deserves someone
better than me.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.883
Schmoo, when I see that boy

16:54.926 --> 16:58.800
and how much he loves you
and how hard he tries,

16:58.843 --> 17:01.411
makes me wonder if maybe
you could be trying
a little harder, too.

17:03.196 --> 17:06.329
I love Geoff so much.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.288
The last thing I want to do
is hold him back.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.812
And, in this case,
maybe that means

17:10.855 --> 17:12.422
I don't get to
be with him,

17:12.466 --> 17:14.511
no matter how much
I want to.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.563
ADULT ADAM: The big game
against Meadowbrook
was starting,

17:22.606 --> 17:23.694
and everyone was there...

17:23.738 --> 17:26.132
Everyone, that is,
except Barry.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.263
CROSBY:
Goldberg, you're up.

17:27.307 --> 17:28.917
Swing or don't swing.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.353
How you strike out
is up to you.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.007
The moment had arrived.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.574
I'd never been a sports hero,

17:33.617 --> 17:35.576
butMajor League taught me
anything was possible.

17:37.099 --> 17:37.969
Just not this time.
Oh, God!

17:38.013 --> 17:39.580
My tender boy body.

17:39.623 --> 17:40.972
Adam?

17:41.016 --> 17:42.713
Barry?
Are you dead, too?

17:42.757 --> 17:43.932
Oh, I'm alive.

17:43.975 --> 17:46.543
And I'm sick of
being a joke.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.241
I'm gonna get revenge
for you,

17:48.284 --> 17:49.894
and every other
four-eyed nerd out there.

17:51.809 --> 17:54.769
Coach, I'm pitching
next inning.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.727
Good thinking.
They're only up a run.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.642
Go get us into a jam.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.080
ADULT ADAM: Barry didn't
just come back to our team
to defend my honor,

18:01.123 --> 18:04.561
he returned to show the world he was finally done with hiding who he really was.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.043

After years of calling me
a four-eyed Dork Lord,

18:16.225 --> 18:19.098
Barry Norman Goldberg
now had glasses.

18:19.141 --> 18:22.318
What is this song?
Where is it even coming from?

18:22.362 --> 18:24.581
Oh, yes.
Just like his hero,

18:24.625 --> 18:26.366
Rick "Wild Thing" Vaughn
inMajor League,

18:26.409 --> 18:28.324
Barry could finally
see clearly,

18:28.368 --> 18:30.979
and he'd use it to win
once and for all.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.154

18:36.854 --> 18:39.205
That day, Barry didn't use
his new glasses

18:39.248 --> 18:40.858
to strike out
the other team.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.730
Instead,
he struck 'em down,

18:42.773 --> 18:45.385
and it felt glorious.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.085
You're out of here!

18:50.129 --> 18:53.044
ADULT ADAM: In that moment,
I had a new sports hero...

18:53.088 --> 18:54.698
Barry "Wild Thing" Goldberg.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.571
Hey, get up.
What?

18:57.614 --> 19:00.051
You heard me.
Get up. Get dressed.

19:00.095 --> 19:01.618
Maybe run a comb
through your hair.

19:01.662 --> 19:02.793
Why? Where are we going?

19:02.837 --> 19:04.621
To get Geoff back.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.014
What about Lou?

19:06.057 --> 19:08.886
If he thinks he's gonna
keep my baby from
the man she loves,

19:08.930 --> 19:12.412
then he's gonna find out
what a bad influence I can be.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.199
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, no one messes
with Beverly Goldberg.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.853
Sure, it took her a while
to get onboard,

19:18.896 --> 19:22.204
but now Geoff's dad
was about to face off
with our Wild Thing.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.379
Evening, Lou.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.643
Thank you for coming
to this ambush.

19:26.687 --> 19:29.472
How dare you say my daughter
isn't good enough for your...

19:29.516 --> 19:30.691
Mom, wait.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.214
I know I begged you
to fix this,

19:32.258 --> 19:34.042
but this is something
I have to do on my own.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.130
But I'm all revved up.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.001
Please, rev down.
I got this.

19:37.045 --> 19:40.048
Look, I know I get
Geoff into trouble

19:40.091 --> 19:41.484
and force him
out of his comfort zone

19:41.528 --> 19:44.444
and have him throw parties
in your living room.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.620
But there is not
a slide show in the world

19:46.663 --> 19:48.796
that will make you see just
how much I love your son.

19:48.839 --> 19:51.277
Even though
I'm selfish and moody

19:51.320 --> 19:53.061
and have so much
growing up to do,

19:53.104 --> 19:55.194
you still love me.

19:55.237 --> 19:58.893
So, yeah, I'm not nearly
good enough
for a guy like you.

19:58.936 --> 20:01.635
But you make me wanna do
whatever it takes
to prove I can be.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.943
Maybe they do bring out
the best in each other.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.771
No maybe, Lou.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.991
They just do.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.602
ADULT ADAM: Sometimes
we've got to fight
for what we love,

20:12.646 --> 20:15.475
but what good is a fight
without a little backup?

20:15.518 --> 20:17.303
Just a bit outside.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.261
That's the thing
about family.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.654
You're a team...

20:20.697 --> 20:22.830
A team that never stops
believing in each other.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.527
And when that happens,

20:24.571 --> 20:26.964
it makes everything
a little more groovy.

ADULT ADAM: How come
when I wear glasses,
you call me a nerd,

20:34.972 --> 20:36.496
but when you wear glasses
you look awesome?

20:36.539 --> 20:38.149
That's not very fair.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.368
ADULT BARRY:
I like the glasses.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.765
Okay.
Move, dumbass.
We can't see.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.723
I know.
I was once like you.

20:46.767 --> 20:50.161
But thanks to major advances
in contact-lens technology,

20:50.205 --> 20:53.339
I now have the vision of
an eagle holding a telescope.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.992
Now that I have
better-than-perfect vision,

20:55.036 --> 20:57.560
a whole new world of careers
has opened up for me.

20:57.604 --> 20:58.692
Behold.

20:58.735 --> 21:01.347
I can now be
a fighter pilot,
umpire,

21:01.390 --> 21:03.566
professional Where's Waldofinder,

21:03.610 --> 21:06.439
avid reader,
guy who writes
things on rice,

21:06.482 --> 21:10.617
long-distance peeping tom,
and Olympic athlete.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.358
It's a tad late to start
training for the Olympics.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.751
Not with these
laser-focused baby browns.

21:14.795 --> 21:17.014
Oh, God, my contact lens
popped out.

21:17.058 --> 21:19.539
Help.
Help me.

21:19.582 --> 21:21.976
Mark my words,
if Barry somehow makes it in,

21:22.019 --> 21:23.151
it will be the most
memorable thing

21:23.194 --> 21:24.500
to ever happen
at the Olympics.
