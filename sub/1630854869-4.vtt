00:17.851 --> 00:20.229
I'm glad you finally
got up the courage to ask me out.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.439
Hey, what do you mean, "finally''?

00:22.731 --> 00:24.942
You don't have to play cool with me, Joey.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.152
Just, I was waiting a while.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.951
- I better head in now.
- Come on. Just one more song.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.452
You're sweet, Joey Shorter.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.873
Now get yourself to work
and ask me out again soon.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.686
You. Inside the house. Now.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.209
Up.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.252
Fetch regulatory halt.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.594
Adhesive tape, 2.5 inches. Thank you.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.393
Down. Follow.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.613
Twenty-three years,
Charlene and I had together.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.700
Way too sweet, just like you.

02:38.700 --> 02:43.413
Every morning she'd say that to me.
God rest her soul.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.418
Now that's love, son. Not like
the cheap kicks you're out prowling for.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.088
I can only hope you went to college.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.923
Of course, sir. Yeah.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.133
Where?

02:55.801 --> 02:56.802
Richmond State.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.345
Major?

02:58.929 --> 03:00.264
English.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.182
And business.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.560
What kind of work that earn you?

03:04.560 --> 03:06.728
Sales. Sales, I'm in sales.

03:06.728 --> 03:10.732
- We're selling lunar--
- I should have guessed. A salesman.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.735
Of course, I'll need to meet your parents.

03:26.832 --> 03:27.833
What's that smell?

03:27.833 --> 03:32.212
That's prime rib. The new models come
with top-notch aroma technology.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.464
Prime rib, huh? Smells like burning money.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.466
Scared money don't make money, Shirl.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.218
I'm feeling good about this town.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
Let's get comfortable
and turn some lives around.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.472
No one's changing any lives today, Jack.

03:44.850 --> 03:50.397
"Regulatory halt. Further commercial
activity may result in arrest"?

03:50.939 --> 03:53.567
This is what we get
for our recent success?

03:53.567 --> 03:57.279
Yeah, Jack. It's on me.
The ad at the ball game.

03:57.279 --> 04:00.115
You gotta make this
go away fast, Shirl. I--

04:00.115 --> 04:01.992
We're just starting
to find our stride here.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.494
- Everything is-- Here we go.
- I'm trying to do every--

04:04.995 --> 04:06.538
- Morning, team.
- Hey.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.624
Joey's not here. Hope he isn't too late.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.084
Very kind, Herb, compassionate even.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.252
We need to talk, fellas.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.714
You know what?
Hey, why don't you guys take a day off?

04:16.423 --> 04:19.801
Fully paid, as a "thank you"
for all of your hard work.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.845
I'll treat it
as an extra training day then.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.556
Oh, yeah. I hear Joey is training
even harder, though, Herb.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.391
I applaud that
and I welcome the challenge.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.644
- Hey, did you also applaud your mother...
- Got it.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.270
...when she was robbing you
of your childhood?

04:31.355 --> 04:34.399
Would you rather I tell them you let
a legal situation blow out of control?

04:34.399 --> 04:38.820
I am taking care of it. Just waiting on HQ
to send some details.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.030
What kinda details?

04:40.030 --> 04:42.950
Tax IDs, gross receipts, lunar zoning--

04:42.950 --> 04:47.037
Jesus. What? They need all that
just for us to do our jobs?

04:47.037 --> 04:51.291
Yeah. It's basic
running-a-business-in-the-real-world.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.379
What is that look?

04:56.672 --> 05:00.425
Morning. Wow,
you actually got a HoloTable.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.637
Yeah. This was a great idea you had.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.223
It's gonna help us sell way deeper
into this turf.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.267
We might not have to uproot
for a while now.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.895
Okay, great. Sorry I'm late.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.730
Oh, no, you picked the perfect day.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.358
Everybody's getting some
well-deserved R and R.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.152
- Shirl's idea.
- Thanks, Shirley.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.738
Hey, Jack,
can I talk to you when you're done here?

05:21.738 --> 05:24.908
Well, yeah, no, of course.
We just finished up, actually.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.037
No, Bun Bun. Of course not.

05:29.872 --> 05:32.040
Okay, anger has its place.

05:33.208 --> 05:37.212
But I can't waste my day off
not fully focused on work.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.799
Hello?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.221
There may be something
wrong with your line, Bun Bun.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.182
You want my advice,
or do you want to keep pretending

05:48.182 --> 05:49.933
there's something wrong
with the line over there?

05:53.937 --> 05:56.857
Yeah. You know, I do say that
advice is like ice cream.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.942
Yeah, that's great, Herb.
Just listen, okay?

05:58.942 --> 06:03.363
Women, like games of chance,
live in realms beyond reason, okay?

06:03.363 --> 06:07.743
A mystic mindset is called for.
Hunches, omens, instincts.

06:07.743 --> 06:11.246
Not avalanches
of explanatory blah, blah, blather.

06:11.246 --> 06:17.169
But if I'm clear and open with her,
and she's clear and open with me--

06:17.169 --> 06:19.922
Disaster. That's a disaster.
Look at me, okay?

06:19.922 --> 06:22.049
I'm working hard
to get my girl up to the moon, right?

06:22.049 --> 06:25.093
Now, do I talk her ear off about that?
No, I don't.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.055
Do I heed certain auspicious signs?
Absolutely.

06:28.055 --> 06:33.352
Which have coalesced over and over again
around milk, milk, and dairy in general.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.229
Look at this. Right here.

06:35.229 --> 06:39.274
Volts by three on the money line
with 61 ringers.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.401
Now, what size do you buy milk in?

06:41.401 --> 06:45.447
Sixty-four, 64 ounces, come on.
Simple math.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.032
I see.

06:47.032 --> 06:50.953
Herb, if you love her,
find your milk and follow it.

06:50.953 --> 06:55.207
Okay. Won't be so hard to do
considering you haven't cleaned up.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.501
Herb.

06:57.501 --> 07:02.714
- Fuck. Oh, no, no. Yes!
- Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry, Eddie.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.882
Okay.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.969
Oh, Herb, you're a genius. Look at that!

07:10.347 --> 07:11.598
Mr. Costopoulos?

07:17.104 --> 07:18.522
Mr. Costopoulos?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.607
Are you okay, Mr. Costopoulos?

07:21.900 --> 07:22.901
Yes, ma'am.

07:23.569 --> 07:26.989
Now, I reviewed the complaint form
you "sumbitted"-- submitted.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.448
You have to be more careful.

07:28.448 --> 07:32.327
- Here, let me help you.
- No need. Please.

07:33.412 --> 07:40.335
As I was saying, I reviewed
and found no legal grounds for complaint.

07:41.545 --> 07:45.048
Your contract "stilputates"
the departure window up to six months.

07:45.048 --> 07:49.428
Jesus, why did I even bother?
I'm never getting up there.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.474
On an entirely separate note,

07:54.474 --> 08:01.440
I have engaged the entity in a 97C4I.
Failure to comply.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.234
Really? What's that?

08:04.234 --> 08:06.695
Forms they neglected to file.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.865
So just paperwork?

08:10.616 --> 08:15.662
Forms, ma'am,
appropriately filled and filed,

08:16.371 --> 08:19.625
are the lifeblood
of our orderly commercial society.

08:20.375 --> 08:24.087
And further noncompliance
constitutes contempt,

08:24.087 --> 08:28.884
which puts it in my power, in cooperation
with the courts, to make arrests.

08:30.427 --> 08:35.640
Oh, my God. Thank you.

08:36.808 --> 08:37.893
You hit them with this,

08:37.893 --> 08:40.729
and some manager somewhere
is finally gonna pay attention

08:40.729 --> 08:41.938
and get me out of here.

08:44.608 --> 08:45.651
You're my hero.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.571
I resent the insinuation, ma'am.

08:49.571 --> 08:53.534
Oh, no, I won't tell anybody. Now,
what does it take to get them arrested?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.119
Well, if they engage in further sales.

09:00.332 --> 09:03.043
Let's hope they don't do that, right?

09:06.088 --> 09:07.756
Don't talk like that, okay?

09:07.756 --> 09:10.843
There is no blue blood
who is any better than you, you got it?

09:10.843 --> 09:12.052
You like this girl, right?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.679
I mean,
I've been planning on asking her out

09:13.679 --> 09:16.390
ever since I bought my pet fish
at the store where she works.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.058
How old is the fish?

09:20.018 --> 09:21.728
Three, almost four.

09:22.437 --> 09:26.358
But you pulled it off, right?
And the date went great.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.442
Well...

09:29.194 --> 09:32.114
he said I can't take her out again
until he meets my parents.

09:38.620 --> 09:44.835
Well, maybe you know someone
who could pinch-hit?

09:47.588 --> 09:50.716
I mean, I got a son about your age.
I could probably pass.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.850
Is this crossing some kind of line, professionally?

10:00.392 --> 10:04.771
Here's the thing about love, kid.
None of those lines matter.

10:07.149 --> 10:10.861
Sticking by her. That's the only rule.

10:12.988 --> 10:15.616
Well, then how about today? Maybe.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.700
Perfect.

10:18.202 --> 10:22.414
Okay. Well, then thanks... Dad.

10:28.754 --> 10:29.755
Fuck.

10:38.180 --> 10:43.101
Bunch of parlayed props, zone-in to start.
Volts win, money line.

10:43.101 --> 10:47.022
All right here if you forget. You see how
the shake smeared off Ramosa and six?

10:48.524 --> 10:49.525
It's very solid.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.612
Puts me and my lady on the moon
in one game.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.322
Not for nothing,

10:55.322 --> 10:58.784
but lunar residence doesn't strike me
as the most stable sector.

10:59.868 --> 11:02.829
And I'd clock that
to cover current obligations.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.207
Well, I'm making it my outlay.

11:08.377 --> 11:09.878
That puts you over the line.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.798
Below the line, it's your knee.

11:13.465 --> 11:17.469
Above the line, it's knees that ain't
yours and you might care about.

11:25.519 --> 11:26.562
Lock it in.

11:27.855 --> 11:28.856
Milk, baby!

11:32.985 --> 11:36.822
Mr. Costopoulos, I came to apologize.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.907
I shouldn't have spoken to you that way.

11:40.284 --> 11:44.121
It's hardly anomalous in my "oppucation."

11:44.121 --> 11:45.581
Often, it's worse.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.794
You have a beautiful dog.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.382
She's passed.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.427
My condolences.

11:59.011 --> 12:01.597
I just wanted to hand this over
from Lunar HQ.

12:03.640 --> 12:08.437
"Der seven. Craxt LP.

12:08.437 --> 12:12.941
Slash plus utrew five."

12:13.525 --> 12:17.070
Solar winds. Hell on our Telex system.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.155
Just wanted to show you,

12:18.155 --> 12:21.200
I'm trying to get the info we owe you
and explain the delay.

12:21.909 --> 12:26.246
If there's any way that I can
put my boys back to work in the meantime.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.166
- They really can't survive without it.
- This is incomprehensible.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.336
Well, exactly. And it's all I can get
right now, so...

12:32.336 --> 12:34.463
You should care more
about your customers, ma'am.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.257
What's that supposed to mean?

12:37.758 --> 12:41.345
I'm sorry. I regret saying it.

12:44.556 --> 12:45.641
Good day.

13:02.658 --> 13:05.160
Also,
I told him that I'm regional manager.

13:05.494 --> 13:08.247
You took my job. Well, that makes me CEO.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.291
Well, no, 'cause then I'm only here
because I'm your son,

13:11.291 --> 13:14.753
so I was thinking
maybe you're just regional manager too.

13:15.337 --> 13:18.006
Wow. You are a bulldog on a deal, kid.

13:20.926 --> 13:24.304
Are you boys the moon men?
'Cause this little birdie's ready to fly.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.765
- Sure, ma'am. How can we help?
- We're closed today.

13:26.765 --> 13:29.184
Well, maybe for all the other girls,
but what about for me?

13:29.768 --> 13:31.436
Yeah, sorry. Goodbye now.

13:35.649 --> 13:39.528
And remember, no business
with the old man tonight.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.907
He'll be looking for any excuse
to count you out.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.035
<i>Good afternoon, JetBall fans</i>.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.495
Another double-malted, please.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.997
Coming right up, sir.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.957
Don't mix it yet. Wait.

13:51.957 --> 13:56.962
N... Now.

13:56.962 --> 13:59.798
<i>Hikaru Makoto steps up to home-zone</i>

13:59.798 --> 14:03.385
<i>to lead-off the opening inner
of what's sure to be a nail-biter.</i>

14:03.385 --> 14:05.137
Hello, guest. What will it be?

14:05.137 --> 14:07.973
Hey, Eddie. So I thought about
what you said, and I called Betty...

14:07.973 --> 14:10.601
Herb, with great affection,
I cannot have the domestic beef

14:10.601 --> 14:12.978
and perpetual failure report near me
right now.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.646
- Okay? Please.
- It was gonna be--

14:14.646 --> 14:16.231
Hello, sluggers.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.275
I know we've had our troubles,

14:18.275 --> 14:21.278
but I've wised up, and I'm ready
to double down on the moon market.

14:21.278 --> 14:24.531
- Can you boys help me out?
- It's our day off, so, no chance.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.408
Well, how about you, boss?

14:26.408 --> 14:28.035
You wanna sell me something special?

14:29.036 --> 14:30.162
Customer does come first.

14:30.162 --> 14:32.873
Don't you lift a goddamn finger, Herb.
After what she did to you.

14:32.873 --> 14:36.084
You-- Get the fuck hence, harpy.
Game of a lifetime here.

14:36.084 --> 14:38.003
Scram. You're gootchin' me.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.635
- One more vanilla malted, please.
- Coming right up.

14:44.635 --> 14:45.761
Just like my pal here.

14:45.761 --> 14:48.805
Go! Go! Yes! Yes!

14:48.805 --> 14:50.933
You just did that, Herb.
You just did that!

14:50.933 --> 14:54.770
You stay right here.
- You drink with me, you miracle.
- Yes!

14:54.770 --> 14:57.105
You know,
I played right-zone back in junior high.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.691
In junior high. I know,
you told me, Herb. About 15 times.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.361
Come sit, everybody.
Make yourselves comfortable.

15:03.278 --> 15:07.366
Joseph tells me you're in sales,
door-to-door.

15:07.366 --> 15:09.743
Must have spent most of his childhood
on the road.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.913
- Absolutely, out always providing for us.
- No. I didn't miss a thing.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.706
Well, it felt like I was gone
more than I was.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.041
Boys need their dads, right?

15:16.041 --> 15:20.295
Don't you find the itinerant lifestyle
breeds loose morals?

15:20.796 --> 15:22.422
Lustful gypsies and such?

15:22.923 --> 15:28.303
Sir, if the road teaches you one lesson,
it's folks don't buy your product,

15:28.303 --> 15:29.763
they buy your character.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.224
I raised this boy
to be the straightest arrow out there.

15:32.224 --> 15:35.060
- <i>The Jet just overthrew and the Dynamo...</i>
- Fuck!

15:36.144 --> 15:37.145
Who, Herb?

15:37.145 --> 15:39.898
Who let these lobotomized puddles
of shame take the field?

15:39.898 --> 15:42.568
- I don't know.
- What genius? Goddamn it.

15:43.443 --> 15:48.282
Hey, do you really think it makes
a difference how much milkshake we drink?

15:50.742 --> 15:53.453
I mean, the players don't actually
know we're doing it.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.247
Well, it's all we got kid,
so suck it down, huh?

15:55.247 --> 15:56.957
Sucking it down for you, Eddie.

15:57.749 --> 16:00.085
You know he did two majors at college?

16:00.085 --> 16:01.837
Had to talk him out of three.

16:01.837 --> 16:05.424
- Dad...
- A triple major at Richmond State?

16:05.424 --> 16:07.384
What would have been the third?

16:09.178 --> 16:10.637
Philanthropy.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.763
Philosophy.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.726
- It's a little joke of ours, together.
- Yeah.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.020
You guys get along great.

16:18.020 --> 16:22.191
What a bond. It's nearly unbelievable.

16:22.691 --> 16:26.028
Not to mention, the Dean
of Business at Richmond State

16:26.028 --> 16:29.323
didn't seem to remember much
about your career there.

16:30.532 --> 16:35.495
Would you excuse us a moment,
my angel? Please.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.249
<i>That's a double-zone set
by the Dynamo and that means</i>

16:39.249 --> 16:41.710
<i>more bad news for the Volts
as the Dynamo takes the lead...</i>

16:42.544 --> 16:45.297
You know, I'm really starting
to understand your passion

16:45.297 --> 16:46.924
for sports and betting.

16:47.966 --> 16:48.967
It's great fun.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.637
As long it doesn't threaten
your personal relationships

16:51.637 --> 16:53.388
or great opportunities at work.

16:53.388 --> 16:56.391
Herb, workers who worship their work
are doomed to die working.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.477
This is my ticket out of all that shit.

16:59.353 --> 17:02.689
Phyllis must have
told you I served in the war.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.276
I was a scout.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.403
Got so I could tell
by the hairs on my neck

17:08.403 --> 17:11.949
if we were facing down an ambush
from those brainwashed crods.

17:11.949 --> 17:14.409
I wish I had been old enough to enlist.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.286
Quit shining me on, mister.

17:16.912 --> 17:19.790
'Cause the hairs on my neck
are screaming over you two

17:19.790 --> 17:21.959
and whatever cheap con
you're running here.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.044
Easy, now. Listen, this is a good kid.

17:24.044 --> 17:27.214
- He's a bullshitter in a bargain-bin suit.
- Hey, watch it.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.966
Excuse me. Jack, I need a minute.

17:28.966 --> 17:31.593
- Not now, Shirl.
- Sure. I'll be packing.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.224
All right.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.145
We'll figure all this out. Two seconds.

17:47.401 --> 17:48.527
This has to be now?

17:48.527 --> 17:50.404
What's going on in there
that's so important?

17:50.404 --> 17:51.613
It's not sales.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.991
I can't fix our problems.

17:54.283 --> 17:56.159
Guy's got it in for us. Let's move on.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.619
- Not gonna happen.
- Why?

17:59.204 --> 18:01.790
- Don't cook up some answer for me.
- No, of course not.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.376
Why are we stuck here?
Why are you throwing money around?

18:04.376 --> 18:06.837
Well, don't stop there, Shirl.
What else you got?

18:06.837 --> 18:08.005
- The car.
- Geez.

18:08.005 --> 18:11.842
- It's a company car, like I said.
- I didn't buy it then either.

18:11.842 --> 18:13.635
What the hell is going on, Jack?

18:15.929 --> 18:18.724
I don't know, Shirl. You tell me.
You seem to have it all figured out.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.270
You're walking away?

18:23.270 --> 18:25.772
- The kid needs my help.
- Congrats, Jack.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.859
Help the kid in need
and then let everything else go to hell.

18:30.986 --> 18:34.323
Is he okay? You work with them, yeah?

18:34.323 --> 18:36.366
My dad's being a real prick in there.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.620
- I'm Phyllis.
- Shirley.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.289
You can see Jack cares
so much about his son.

18:43.123 --> 18:46.543
Would you please tell him I'm sorry
if I don't get the chance?

18:52.549 --> 18:54.134
- Now, look, pal.
- You hold your tongue.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.844
Oh, no. You hold your fucking tongue.

18:55.844 --> 18:59.181
Stop!
I was just about to tell him the truth.

19:01.934 --> 19:06.146
About how Mom... was in an accident...

19:08.732 --> 19:12.152
pretty bad, and she's still not out
of the woods yet, but...

19:14.821 --> 19:17.241
Well, how you'd been gone for a while,

19:17.241 --> 19:19.618
but you came back to help. And...

19:23.664 --> 19:25.415
Oh, Joe, come here, you didn't have to--

19:30.170 --> 19:32.089
I done a lot that I'm not proud of.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.549
And the truth is...

19:38.136 --> 19:40.180
I left his mom when he was a boy.

19:42.099 --> 19:45.769
And he has been man enough

19:47.020 --> 19:48.981
to let me back into his life.

19:49.690 --> 19:53.652
And now, really, I'd be lost without him.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.947
Tell you this, though.

19:57.447 --> 20:01.827
He's taken the worst punches
life has to offer,

20:03.161 --> 20:08.083
and all it's done is left him
ready for anything.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.586
And if that's not what you want
for your daughter,

20:10.586 --> 20:12.045
I feel sorry for her.

20:15.883 --> 20:18.886
I'm sorry about your mother, Joe.
I know what it's like.

20:19.595 --> 20:20.596
I know you do.

20:20.596 --> 20:24.975
I still keep my Charlene right here
by my heart.

20:26.018 --> 20:27.936
Phil, would you like me to...

20:30.439 --> 20:32.024
Yes. Please.

20:33.984 --> 20:35.652
- <i>The end of eight and a half innings.</i>
- Come on.

20:35.652 --> 20:38.947
<i>Dynamo six, Volts four.
Volts fans looking very nervous right now.</i>

20:38.947 --> 20:40.490
- We need to talk, Ed.
- No.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.159
- Bit bigger than the game.
- I am not a man

20:42.159 --> 20:43.952
you wanna be seen with right now,
Shirl, okay?

20:43.952 --> 20:45.245
Get lost, stranger.

20:45.245 --> 20:48.415
I don't have time or money
for your famine-racked orphans, okay?

20:48.415 --> 20:50.584
<i>This will be the half-inning
that will be the determining one</i>

20:50.584 --> 20:51.668
<i>for the series champion.</i>

20:51.668 --> 20:54.755
<i>Hearts are beating,
pulses are racing on every...</i>

20:54.755 --> 20:55.839
Orphans, huh?

20:56.840 --> 21:03.013
<i>The Vistaville Volts, facing impossible
headwinds, pray for a miracle.</i>

21:15.901 --> 21:18.987
I told myself I was done weeping for her.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.615
- What?
- But...

21:22.533 --> 21:23.617
that's her smell.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.583
<i>Down by two zones,</i>

21:31.583 --> 21:36.672
<i>let's see if Johnny Zapp can
turn this mess around for the Volts.</i>

21:36.672 --> 21:39.800
Herb, it's dawning on me I might have
made a decent-sized mistake here.

21:40.968 --> 21:44.054
Well, I guess we better
keep drinking then.

21:44.054 --> 21:46.640
Oh, God. This is what it's like to die.

21:46.640 --> 21:50.435
I'm floating. I hear my mother's voice
calling from the kitchen.

21:51.061 --> 21:52.062
<i>Line drive.</i>

21:52.062 --> 21:57.693
<i>That ball has ripped to right field,
sailing towards the foul pole.</i>

21:57.693 --> 21:59.862
- <i>And the call is out of bounds.</i>
- What?

21:59.862 --> 22:02.573
- No. No!
- <i>Oh, boy!</i>

22:02.573 --> 22:05.367
- <i>No zones for Zapp.</i>
- What? Are you kidding?

22:05.367 --> 22:07.578
- <i>It sailed wide right by a hair.</i>
- No, it didn't.

22:07.578 --> 22:08.871
Look at it again!

22:10.122 --> 22:12.207
How can that happen?

22:13.208 --> 22:14.209
Oh, shit.

22:14.710 --> 22:17.171
I do not prefer my evenings
to end this way.

22:17.171 --> 22:18.297
Well, me neither.

22:18.297 --> 22:22.926
<i>Count back to two strikers
and Zapp with one last Hail Mary try.</i>

22:22.926 --> 22:25.095
You and me. We're gonna chug
like my life depends on it.

22:25.095 --> 22:26.555
Come on. Chug. Chug. Chug.

22:27.723 --> 22:31.560
Herbie? Herbert Porter.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.229
You!

22:35.063 --> 22:36.982
- Little Miss Spread-'Em-Wide.
- No, no!

22:36.982 --> 22:40.569
- No! She's just a customer, Bun Bun.
- Herb, here comes the pitch! Herb!

22:48.202 --> 22:51.580
<i>Going! Going! Gone!</i>

22:51.580 --> 22:54.875
- I won. We won.
- <i>It's an all-zoners grand slam!</i>

22:54.875 --> 22:57.211
- I just-- We won.
- <i>Volts win!</i>

22:57.211 --> 22:58.545
Shirley!

22:58.545 --> 23:01.465
We won. I won. Milk.

23:02.090 --> 23:04.510
- You're my milk, Bun Bun.
- I won!

23:04.510 --> 23:05.802
And what's that mean?

23:05.802 --> 23:08.639
I have no idea. But it's great.

23:09.765 --> 23:11.058
We won.

23:11.058 --> 23:12.142
I won!

23:14.728 --> 23:17.314
You see,
there are minerals in certain craters

23:17.314 --> 23:22.569
that absorb light so at night,
they kind of glow.

23:23.529 --> 23:26.240
Now, say I wanted to help

23:26.240 --> 23:29.493
my daughter's young suitor here
with some extra commission.

23:29.493 --> 23:31.745
Who doesn't need
another write-off, right, Jack?

23:31.745 --> 23:34.081
Well, I'm happy to help, Phil,
but it turns out it's our day off.

23:34.957 --> 23:39.002
Don't run games on me,
Jacky, this day off, slow-play nonsense.

23:39.002 --> 23:40.712
It's okay, Dad. I don't mind.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.589
There is plenty of time
for business later.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.675
Hell, we might know each other
our whole lives.

23:44.675 --> 23:46.844
Yeah. I can take a hint, Jack.

23:51.557 --> 23:52.558
Jack.

23:54.726 --> 23:56.103
Why didn't you tell me?

23:57.980 --> 23:58.981
Well...

24:00.983 --> 24:02.651
It was better that you didn't know.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.028
Let's get out of the hallway, okay?

24:05.028 --> 24:06.697
He's out in the bar anyway.

24:06.697 --> 24:09.950
He-- Who is?

24:10.701 --> 24:13.745
Your son, Jack. Come on.

24:19.293 --> 24:21.628
You know, he's not actually...

24:28.927 --> 24:32.973
fully up to speed on that yet.

24:33.807 --> 24:36.977
So, please. I'm not proud of this,
but, yeah, he's my boy.

24:39.146 --> 24:42.232
So he doesn't know,
but that girl and her dad do?

24:42.232 --> 24:46.236
Well... what we told them was a lie,

24:46.236 --> 24:49.740
but what I'm telling you now,
Shirl, is the truth.

24:50.324 --> 24:51.700
My God, Jack.

24:55.579 --> 24:57.706
Your family up on the moon, do they know?

25:01.543 --> 25:03.378
Well, as far as they go,

25:04.254 --> 25:07.508
it turns out it's easier to sell people

25:07.508 --> 25:11.512
as a loving father
and husband than as I, you kn--

25:12.930 --> 25:15.224
I never told you so you never had to lie.

25:25.359 --> 25:27.819
Pretty lonely life you made for yourself.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.697
No, come o-- I've got the best people
in the world with me.

25:33.075 --> 25:35.410
Sorry it had me acting so strange.

25:35.994 --> 25:37.871
You know you have to tell him.

25:38.413 --> 25:40.624
Of course,
but there's a lot I can do for him

25:40.624 --> 25:42.668
without him hating me
for who I used to be.

25:42.668 --> 25:44.545
Once he's up on his feet,
I'll tell him everything.

25:44.545 --> 25:45.712
It'll be up to him.

25:46.171 --> 25:49.842
Good luck with that. I mean it.

25:52.094 --> 25:54.054
You know what? I'm gonna tell him tonight.

25:54.721 --> 25:57.766
He's a great kid, and if he doesn't
get it now, he never will. Right?

25:57.766 --> 26:00.853
Good for you. It won't be easy.

26:05.941 --> 26:06.942
Night.

26:08.569 --> 26:10.279
Now, look here, Mr. Montes.

26:10.279 --> 26:12.698
If Phyllis is going
to be dating a salesman,

26:12.698 --> 26:15.909
then you better not be the kind
who wastes easy money by,

26:15.909 --> 26:16.994
you know, taking days off.

26:16.994 --> 26:19.913
So, I'm thinking,
if you're still interested,

26:20.914 --> 26:23.750
maybe we could do some business.

26:25.294 --> 26:27.713
Now that's my kind of attitude, Joe.

26:52.863 --> 26:54.698
Not really in the mood, Ed.

26:55.199 --> 26:58.619
Okay. Is this about the important thing
you wanted to tell me?

26:58.869 --> 26:59.870
No.

27:01.038 --> 27:02.539
Turned out to be nothing.

27:03.749 --> 27:08.003
'Kay. You wanna hear
my important thing then,

27:08.003 --> 27:11.131
which is actually-- It's not nothing.

27:14.968 --> 27:17.387
So I spent my whole life saying,
"This is the moment.

27:17.387 --> 27:20.098
This is the moment that my whole life
has been leading up to."

27:20.098 --> 27:22.809
But this, this is really it.

27:29.358 --> 27:30.359
Jesus, Eddie.

27:30.359 --> 27:32.569
Because if it's a yes from you about this,

27:33.070 --> 27:35.822
I will never want bigger than that. Ever.

27:36.490 --> 27:39.243
- Lot B-18.
- Midsize B-Plex.

27:39.243 --> 27:40.869
Full of charm.

27:40.869 --> 27:45.582
Let's call it a beginning
of more than we can currently know.

27:47.084 --> 27:49.378
It's great, Eddie. You did great.

27:50.254 --> 27:54.758
Excuse me, this is now.
This-- Are we doing this or what?

27:55.634 --> 27:56.802
You're really serious.

27:56.802 --> 27:59.304
Shirley, powerful forces are at work here.

27:59.304 --> 28:01.181
They are not to be spurned.

28:02.474 --> 28:05.686
And... I love you.

28:06.687 --> 28:07.938
I love you, Shirley.

28:20.909 --> 28:23.120
It's kinda scary
how good you were on your feet.

28:23.787 --> 28:27.708
Now, do we need to have a birds-and-bees
talk before your next date?

28:28.750 --> 28:30.878
No, I think I'm all right without that.

28:33.505 --> 28:35.424
You are an impressive young man, Joe.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.635
N-- You know, strange as it may sound,

28:38.635 --> 28:41.638
I meant a lot of what I said in there.

28:43.348 --> 28:44.349
And...

28:47.853 --> 28:48.854
And...

28:59.156 --> 29:00.824
I know that you can't stand him.

29:02.075 --> 29:03.660
But wherever he is...

29:05.495 --> 29:08.832
I bet your dad would be proud
to call you his son.

29:12.002 --> 29:15.756
Well... Thanks for everything, Jack.

29:17.299 --> 29:19.134
I would've given up on it without you.

29:20.219 --> 29:22.387
"Give up"? Never.

29:23.180 --> 29:25.682
Not my son. Get out of here.

29:27.059 --> 29:28.060
Good night.
