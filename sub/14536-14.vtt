<i>¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶</i>

00:06.823 --> 00:09.699
<i>¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶</i>

00:09.735 --> 00:12.969
<i>¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep their heads so cool ¶</i>

00:13.004 --> 00:15.764
<i>¶ I'll always find a way ¶</i>

00:15.799 --> 00:18.817
<i>¶ A way out of the fire ¶</i>

00:18.853 --> 00:21.628
<i>¶ But don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶</i>

00:21.663 --> 00:23.914
<i>¶ I'm not perfect ¶</i>

00:23.949 --> 00:27.134

I wanna tell you ¶</i>

00:27.169 --> 00:30.278

00:30.313 --> 00:31.521
<i>¶ I keep it undercover! ¶</i>

00:31.557 --> 00:34.007

00:34.042 --> 00:36.234

<i>¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby I'm fearless ¶</i>

00:37.980 --> 00:39.988
<i>¶ But I always got your back ¶</i>

00:40.024 --> 00:42.365
<i>¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶</i>

00:42.401 --> 00:44.409
<i>¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶</i>

00:44.445 --> 00:46.911
<i>¶ Ain't got no worry about me ¶</i>

00:46.947 --> 00:48.855
<i>¶ It's all part of the plan ¶</i>

00:48.890 --> 00:50.623
K.C:<i> I keep it undercover.</i>

00:50.659 --> 00:52.250
<i>I keep it undercover.</i>

00:58.842 --> 01:01.176
Your Honor, the Prosecution
calls Agent 8433599.

01:06.442 --> 01:08.750
I feel like I should be
walking her up there.

01:08.785 --> 01:10.545
Craig, she's testifying,
not getting married.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.064
Do you swear to tell the truth,

01:14.099 --> 01:15.435
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth?

01:15.459 --> 01:17.509
Yes, I do.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.577
One time, I was on my porch

01:19.613 --> 01:21.315
when my neighbor Mrs. Goldfeder
got dropped off after a date,

01:21.339 --> 01:22.692
and when they kissed,
I didn't look away, I...

01:22.716 --> 01:23.949
I watched.

01:26.662 --> 01:29.921
I meant when Prosecutor Baker
starts asking you questions.

01:29.956 --> 01:32.440
Oh, I knew that. ( Chuckles )

01:32.475 --> 01:33.795
Just had to
get that off my chest.

01:36.021 --> 01:39.873
Agent, you were present at The Luffman
Gallery when the theft took place?

01:39.909 --> 01:41.752
Uh, yes. I was investigating
a string of art thefts.

01:41.776 --> 01:44.236
I was accompanied by
Agent 9487445,

01:44.271 --> 01:46.112
even though I was..

01:46.148 --> 01:47.780
A bit concerned
about his abilities.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.324
He can be a bit of a nimrod.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.859
I object!

01:50.894 --> 01:52.627
How dare you call me a nimrod?

01:52.663 --> 01:54.504
That is insulting

01:54.539 --> 01:57.099
and the witness
is clearly lying.

01:57.134 --> 01:58.817
I demand a mistrial! A mistrial!

02:00.704 --> 02:02.913
Nobody even knew
you were Agent 9487445

02:02.948 --> 02:04.228
until you opened your big mouth.

02:05.718 --> 02:07.784
Objection overruled.

02:07.819 --> 02:08.819
Sorry, nimrod.

02:10.689 --> 02:13.707
Please continue.

02:13.742 --> 02:16.462
Well, I went undercover to see if I
could catch the thief in the act.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.380
I am Lola Fingers.

02:22.526 --> 02:24.618
Artiste.

02:24.653 --> 02:26.595
And I'm her manager,
Tommy Lasorda.

02:28.723 --> 02:30.674
The artiste's manager,

02:30.709 --> 02:32.609
not the baseball manager.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.970
He's a large white man,
and I'm a short black guy

02:35.005 --> 02:36.285
with a penchant for turtlenecks.

02:38.867 --> 02:39.942
Your work is genius,

02:39.977 --> 02:41.668
as is your hair.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.936
Oh, well,

02:43.972 --> 02:46.406
my style is "perpetually
caught in a breeze"

02:49.486 --> 02:52.712
to remind me that
life is always moving...

02:52.748 --> 02:54.414
as must art.

02:57.519 --> 02:58.927
Oh, yes.

02:58.962 --> 03:01.296
This space is perfect!

03:02.524 --> 03:03.973
It's bare.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.109
It's naked.

03:06.145 --> 03:07.625
I will cover your shame,
naked wall...

03:09.781 --> 03:10.781
With art!

03:13.043 --> 03:15.794
She'll need total privacy.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.662
Her most creative hours
are two to five a.m.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.574
You've got it, Lola.
But it would be

03:20.609 --> 03:22.484
an honor to come by
and see you work.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.438
Why wait?

03:26.473 --> 03:28.782
She can do one right now.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.817
Lola's known
for her spontaneous paintings.

03:30.852 --> 03:32.218
( Chuckles ) Yes.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.694
I'm also known
for firing my manager.

03:35.791 --> 03:37.774
Come on, Lola.

03:37.809 --> 03:39.776
Do the one
where you roll around and...

03:39.811 --> 03:45.123
Why am I explaining when she
can just show you? Lola?

03:45.158 --> 03:47.638
Oh, no. No, thank you. I'm just
not feeling the muse right now.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.723
Then let me help you feel it.

03:52.758 --> 03:55.750
Waaa... aha...

03:55.786 --> 03:57.678
Oh, yes.

03:57.713 --> 03:59.654
Oh, I'm not done. I'm not done.

03:59.690 --> 04:02.790
Ohhhh, lovely!

04:02.826 --> 04:05.769
Oh, yes! Yes, I'm really
starting to feel it...

04:05.804 --> 04:06.804
everywhere now.

04:07.772 --> 04:10.048
Yes!

04:10.083 --> 04:11.491
Oh, yeah!

04:13.803 --> 04:16.137
Lola, you've done it again.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.373
Don't hold back.
Rage is your medium.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.179
I love it.

04:27.909 --> 04:30.310
Yes, Lola. You've done it again.

04:30.345 --> 04:32.679
Eh, I wouldn't say
it's your best work.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.235
Oh, really?

04:39.271 --> 04:41.187
Oh, lovely.

04:44.351 --> 04:45.351
Ah!

04:46.737 --> 04:48.085
Look at that!

04:48.121 --> 04:50.196
Another Lola Fingers original.

04:52.133 --> 04:53.253
Allow me to sign it for you.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.349
Agent 8433599,

05:01.385 --> 05:03.026
would you describe the moment

05:03.061 --> 05:04.363
when you apprehended
the defendant?

05:04.387 --> 05:06.546
Sure. Well,

05:06.581 --> 05:08.665
most people think that
spy work is fun and exciting,

05:08.700 --> 05:12.193
and most of the time
it is, but...

05:12.228 --> 05:14.604
a lot of the time, it's just
a lot of waiting and watching.

05:14.640 --> 05:19.317
And after a lot of waiting and
watching, and coconut water,

05:19.353 --> 05:22.654
the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth is...

05:22.689 --> 05:25.273
sometimes you just gotta pee.

05:25.308 --> 05:27.484
OK? I was only gone
for, like, two minutes

05:27.519 --> 05:30.728
<i>when I heard the alarm go off
and I ran back in.</i>

05:30.764 --> 05:32.514
( alarm bell ringing )
<i>When I got back,</i>

05:32.549 --> 05:34.374
<i>Descoteaux's
"Woman On A Horse At Dawn,"</i>

05:34.451 --> 05:36.195
<i>the most expensive painting
in the gallery,</i>

05:36.219 --> 05:37.735
<i>was cut out of its frame.</i>

05:37.771 --> 05:39.190
<i>And I know
it didn't ride itself out,</i>

05:39.214 --> 05:40.888
<i>(A) Because it's a painting,</i>

05:40.924 --> 05:42.940
<i>(and B) Because
it was two lines and a dot</i>

05:42.976 --> 05:45.176
<i>that didn't look a dang thing</i>
<i>like a horse</i> or<i> a woman.</i>

05:46.855 --> 05:48.270
<i>I looked around, and all I saw</i>

05:48.306 --> 05:50.982
<i>was security guard Mr. McCoy.</i>

05:51.018 --> 05:52.358
<i>He was off of his assigned post,</i>

05:52.394 --> 05:54.077
<i>out of breath, and he claimed</i>

05:54.112 --> 05:55.678
<i>that he didn't know
what had happened.</i>

05:55.713 --> 05:58.364
Like I was gonna fall
for the okey-doke.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.184
And is that
security guard here today?

06:01.220 --> 06:03.152
Well, yeah. He's right there.

06:03.187 --> 06:04.787
He's the guy on trial.

06:04.823 --> 06:08.516
Does nobody else see him, or...?

06:08.551 --> 06:11.052
And how do you know someone
else didn't steal the painting?

06:11.087 --> 06:13.404
The building was on lockdown
with very tight security.

06:13.439 --> 06:15.119
None of the entry ways
were breached, so...

06:15.158 --> 06:16.903
Mr. McCoy was the only one
who could've done it.

06:16.927 --> 06:18.326
Prosecution rests!

06:21.632 --> 06:23.343
My bad. The prosecution
gives me the stink-eye

06:23.367 --> 06:24.647
and will rest when she sees fit.

06:31.232 --> 06:32.949
Petey. ( Nervous chuckle )

06:32.984 --> 06:35.126
What are you doing here?
The Coopers aren't home.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.453
Which begs the question:
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

06:37.489 --> 06:39.664
Nothing.

06:39.699 --> 06:42.108
Really? 'Cause
it seems to me that

06:42.143 --> 06:44.802
you're stealing
K.C.'s old book reports.

06:44.838 --> 06:48.189
Well, I prefer the term
"borrowing with intent to pass".

06:50.002 --> 06:51.534
What do you care?

06:51.569 --> 06:54.195
I don't care. But K.C. will.

06:54.231 --> 06:58.166
So here's how
this is gonna work.

06:58.202 --> 07:01.252
We're going for an All-I-Can-Eat
lunch at the Olive Pit. Your treat.

07:01.287 --> 07:03.555
Are you blackmailing me?

07:03.590 --> 07:07.033
Oh, I am.

07:07.069 --> 07:10.253
But I'll take my payment
in small, unmarked meatballs.

07:10.288 --> 07:12.547
You<i> are</i> a small,
unmarked meatball.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.736
( Gavel strikes )

07:18.021 --> 07:20.246
Bob McCoy.

07:20.281 --> 07:22.999
A jury of your peers
has found you...

07:23.035 --> 07:25.109
guilty as charged.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.262
( Spectators murmuring )

07:27.297 --> 07:29.864
No! They're wrong. I'm innocent!

07:29.899 --> 07:31.774
Congrats, K.C.!
Your 100th conviction.

07:31.810 --> 07:33.518
I can't wait until mine.

07:33.553 --> 07:35.570
Me neither.
Only a hundred to go.

07:39.108 --> 07:40.611
You have to help me.
Please, you have to believe me.

07:40.635 --> 07:42.811
I'm innocent. But a
jury of your peers...

07:42.846 --> 07:44.315
If I did it, where's the art?
They never found the art.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.905
Find the art
and you'll find the thief.

07:45.940 --> 07:47.807
Please! I'm being set up!

07:47.843 --> 07:49.028
I wouldn't know a Rembrandt
from my rear end!

07:49.052 --> 07:50.252
You gotta believe me! Help me!

07:54.875 --> 07:56.075
Well, honey. You got your guy.

08:00.496 --> 08:01.804
Did I?

08:09.339 --> 08:11.022
Marisa, I'm freaking out.

08:11.058 --> 08:11.814
Thanks to my testimony,

08:11.849 --> 08:14.575
an innocent man could be
going to prison for 20 years.

08:14.610 --> 08:16.427
I can totally relate.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.896
You can?

08:18.932 --> 08:21.966
Yes. Petey is blackmailing me
to hang out with him.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.210
It was only a couple of days,
but it felt like 20 years.

08:24.245 --> 08:26.913
He made me take him to pizza,

08:26.948 --> 08:29.223
and then the movies,
and then the circus.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.583
And, boy, can that kid snack.

08:36.324 --> 08:38.407
Wow! Petey might as well
skip the middleman

08:38.442 --> 08:40.685
and pull out his own teeth.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.621
And why exactly
is he blackmailing you?

08:43.656 --> 08:45.932
Who cares? You put
an innocent man behind bars.

08:51.539 --> 08:53.815
Miami, Atlanta,
Chicago, New York.

08:53.850 --> 08:56.117
Ding ding! Places we
should go on spring break!

08:56.152 --> 08:58.511
No, no, no.
They're all the cities that

08:58.547 --> 09:01.823
the Cecil B. DeVille Traveling Circus
appeared in in the past few months.

09:01.858 --> 09:04.642
And they're all the same places
that the art heists took place.

09:04.678 --> 09:05.678
At the same time.

09:08.073 --> 09:10.464
Where are you going? To prison.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.875
Wow. I always assumed I'd
wind up there before she did.

09:16.148 --> 09:17.148
( Buzzer sounds )

09:18.959 --> 09:21.851
Ah. I'm Officer Frida...

09:21.887 --> 09:22.887
Dudeinjail.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.182
Hey! Eyes down here, big guy.

09:28.218 --> 09:30.192
Look, I know I'm beautiful,<i> but,</i>

09:30.228 --> 09:31.228
get over it!

09:33.323 --> 09:35.365
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to talk to McCoy.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.600
Got a message from the warden.

09:37.827 --> 09:38.827
Thank you.

09:40.638 --> 09:44.532
Well! You're lookin' weak,
McCoy!

09:44.567 --> 09:46.848
You should be using your time
in the slammer to get swole!

09:50.965 --> 09:51.965
( Sighs )

09:54.769 --> 09:56.627
And with any luck,
you won't be here very long.

09:56.663 --> 09:57.920
You're going to kill me?

10:00.441 --> 10:02.008
No! You know
who I am. Look at me.

10:04.479 --> 10:07.689
Imagine there's two.

10:07.724 --> 10:09.298
Hey... You're the one
who put me away.

10:09.334 --> 10:13.294
Yes, I am. But right now,
I'm Officer Frida Dudeinjail,

10:13.330 --> 10:15.254
and with any luck,

10:15.289 --> 10:16.906
I will actually
free the dude in jail.

10:16.941 --> 10:22.086
Hard to believe the jury took
your word over mine.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.655
Hey, that is not the point, OK?

10:24.690 --> 10:26.474
The point is,
I don't think you're guilty.

10:26.509 --> 10:27.803
And you couldn't have
mentioned that

10:27.827 --> 10:29.694
when you were
on the stand testifying?!

10:29.729 --> 10:32.030
Hey! Look,
you asked me for help,

10:32.065 --> 10:33.309
and I'm here to clear your name.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.573
I'm gonna get you out of here.

10:34.609 --> 10:35.736
I'm almost positive
who the real thief is.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.410
It's either a... a performer,

10:37.445 --> 10:40.138
or some type of animal...

10:40.173 --> 10:41.173
in a traveling circus.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.176
OK...

10:45.211 --> 10:47.086
looks like I'm going
to be in here a while.

10:47.121 --> 10:48.772
But don't worry about me.

10:48.807 --> 10:51.766
Historically, skinny, weak guys
do great in prison.

10:58.041 --> 11:01.334
And the organization now agrees
that I'm onto something.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.489
Guys, I have to make this right
and get McCoy out of jail.

11:03.513 --> 11:05.688
So, who's ready

11:05.723 --> 11:07.003
to run away and join the circus?

11:09.644 --> 11:11.744
Please. I did that
the day I moved in here.

11:24.425 --> 11:27.051
OK, that would jack
my circuitry<i> up!</i>

11:40.516 --> 11:41.711
Guys, I'm...
I'm getting really emotional,

11:41.735 --> 11:43.384
I feel like...

11:43.419 --> 11:44.859
we finally found
Ernie's real family.

11:47.073 --> 11:50.107
Hello... I'm Cecil B. DeVille,

11:50.143 --> 11:52.935
the owner of Cecil B.
DeVille's Traveling Circus,

11:52.970 --> 11:55.062
and the world's
greatest ringmaster.

11:55.097 --> 11:56.722
Or, as my mother
likes to call me,

11:56.758 --> 11:59.425
the world's greatest
disappointment.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.877
Well, I'm Kimmy
and this is my family.

12:01.913 --> 12:03.571
Where are you traveling to next?

12:03.606 --> 12:07.191
My office,
for my afternoon cry sesh.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.910
( Choking up )
Well, thank you so much

12:09.945 --> 12:11.370
for coming on short notice.

12:11.405 --> 12:13.472
Oh, of course. We are honored

12:13.507 --> 12:15.499
to be a part
of your incredible operation.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.975
What? You didn't have anything
to do with my quadruple bypass.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.698
Oh! Oh, this two-bit circus.

12:22.734 --> 12:24.375
Yeah, right.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.345
I wish more young people
felt that way.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.875
Kids today would rather sit
in front of their computers

12:28.899 --> 12:30.422
and watch clips of the circus

12:30.458 --> 12:32.275
than go to the actual circus.

12:32.310 --> 12:34.835
Not just kids. Adults too.

12:34.871 --> 12:37.705
See, all you have to do is click
on this link, and then you can...

12:37.740 --> 12:39.874
Yeah, I can see how that
would be a problem for you.

12:42.353 --> 12:44.120
Aren't you
a little small and fragile

12:44.155 --> 12:45.847
to be a circus performer?

12:45.882 --> 12:47.368
And aren't you
a little sad and depressed

12:47.392 --> 12:48.874
to be a ringmaster?

12:48.909 --> 12:50.593
Touch.

12:52.622 --> 12:54.513
Well, ya'all get settled.

12:54.548 --> 12:56.641
Your dressing rooms
are right over there.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.434
You'll find them
right past my broken dream.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.425
Hey, did you guys hear that?

13:06.460 --> 13:08.953
Yeah! We get
our own dressing rooms!

13:08.988 --> 13:10.979
No. His business is struggling.

13:11.015 --> 13:12.601
It's motive to steal
if I've ever heard it.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.501
Well, that's one possibility.

13:14.577 --> 13:16.703
Let's fan out and see
what else we come up with.

13:16.738 --> 13:19.372
Great. I'll start with spying
on Cecil during his cry sesh.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.876
What? It's funny to me
when grown men cry.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.319
Where'd they all go?

13:33.354 --> 13:35.454
( laughs )

13:35.490 --> 13:36.972
Looking for these?

13:37.008 --> 13:39.100
Petey. ( Chuckling )

13:39.135 --> 13:42.035
You're not supposed to be here
when the Coopers aren't home.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.129
You're in big trouble, mister.

13:44.165 --> 13:46.014
Big, big trouble.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.850
I'm thinking you take
me to the movies.

13:47.885 --> 13:50.043
I'm thinking
I'll call your bluff.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.313
I'm thinking I'll call K.C.

13:52.348 --> 13:55.250
I'm thinking...

13:55.326 --> 13:57.246
that we should leave now
before we miss previews.

13:59.714 --> 14:02.582
I like your thinking.
(chuckles) Oh...

14:02.617 --> 14:05.001
trust me, you don't wanna
know what I'm thinking.

14:08.331 --> 14:10.622
Hi, everybody!

14:10.658 --> 14:13.159
I am Kimmy James,
the new tightrope walker.

14:13.194 --> 14:14.594
I'm so gosh-darn excited
to be here.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.063
Has anyone seen
my new partner Laszlo?

14:18.099 --> 14:19.932
I am Laszlo.

14:28.793 --> 14:30.959
(foreign accent)
You're looking for me?

14:30.995 --> 14:32.403
Well, if I wasn't before,
I am now.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.391
I am Kimmy James,
the high-priestess

14:37.427 --> 14:38.427
of the high wire.

14:40.062 --> 14:41.762
So, you walk the tightrope

14:41.798 --> 14:43.278
with religious authority
of some type?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.450
Where are you from?

14:46.486 --> 14:48.519
Wisconsin, the heart
of America's dairyland.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.820
Oh. So am I.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.488
Really?

14:51.524 --> 14:55.092
No! I am Romanian.

14:55.127 --> 14:57.052
But I have family
that lives in Wisconsin.

14:57.088 --> 14:58.362
What part are you from?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.606
Wh... Uh, what part
is your family from?

15:00.641 --> 15:01.732
( Chuckles ) Madison.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.659
Yeah, well, I'm from...

15:03.695 --> 15:05.252
the other part. Oh, Kenosha?

15:05.288 --> 15:07.771
Yup. Yup, that's me.

15:07.807 --> 15:08.940
Straight outta Kenosha.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.048
OK. So I checked out
all the concession workers.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.302
No art thieves, but
plenty of crooks. Hmm.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.740
You know, they have the nerve to
charge $8.99 for a funnel cake

15:23.764 --> 15:25.204
and then skimp
on the powdered sugar.

15:26.409 --> 15:30.035
Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!

15:30.070 --> 15:31.849
Hey, are you gonna sneeze your
way through this whole mission?

15:31.873 --> 15:33.389
I'm allergic
to these dumb tigers.

15:33.425 --> 15:34.723
( Growling )

15:34.758 --> 15:36.925
I think that you mean

15:36.961 --> 15:40.112
these majestic, beautiful giants

15:40.148 --> 15:42.581
who pretty much outrank you
on the food chain.

15:42.617 --> 15:43.766
( Growling louder )

15:52.544 --> 15:53.693
( toots ) Whoa!

15:55.880 --> 15:56.880
Oh, hi!

16:01.685 --> 16:03.135
Yeah.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.987
My makeup doesn't look right.

16:05.022 --> 16:06.022
I'm new at this.

16:08.342 --> 16:11.485
You're old at this?

16:11.520 --> 16:13.004
So... you wanna do my makeup?

16:14.632 --> 16:15.632
OK. Sounds good to me.

16:23.841 --> 16:26.150
You know, it's not easy
being the new clown in town.

16:26.185 --> 16:28.811
It's a lot of pressure.

16:28.846 --> 16:31.272
What if my pants fall down
<i>before</i> they're supposed to?

16:34.777 --> 16:36.777
What if everyone laughs at me?

16:36.813 --> 16:37.973
Or worse, what if they don't?

16:44.487 --> 16:45.487
Aw, thank you!

16:53.880 --> 16:55.838
Hey! I like.

16:58.576 --> 17:00.801
Well! Maybe I should wear
makeup more often.

17:06.542 --> 17:08.337
Not that it really matters
because I probably won't be able

17:08.361 --> 17:10.152
to keep the lights on
for another day,

17:10.187 --> 17:12.521
but what exactly is it
that you do, kid?

17:12.557 --> 17:14.656
Balloon animals? Poodle tricks?

17:14.692 --> 17:17.059
I am Judini,

17:17.094 --> 17:19.561
the Human-ish Cannonball.

17:19.596 --> 17:22.856
Uh-huh.

17:22.892 --> 17:25.451
Sweetie, I'm not familiar
with all the child labor laws,

17:25.486 --> 17:27.497
but I'm pretty sure shooting a
little girl out of a cannon

17:27.521 --> 17:29.538
is frowned upon.

17:29.574 --> 17:31.623
I'm tougher than I look.

17:31.659 --> 17:32.992
Punch me in the stomach.

17:33.027 --> 17:34.844
Come on. Punch me!

17:34.879 --> 17:36.921
I'm pretty sure
that's frowned upon too.

17:39.417 --> 17:40.849
Ouch!

17:40.885 --> 17:42.951
Ow! That...

17:42.987 --> 17:45.329
Cannon's over there.

17:45.364 --> 17:46.764
Knock yourself out, Judini.

17:46.799 --> 17:47.799
Ow!

17:51.295 --> 17:54.955
Now it is time that we rehearse.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.431
On that little piece
of dental floss?

17:58.210 --> 18:01.704
Ah... I mean, I wouldn't have it
any other way.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.123
Except we<i> could</i> have it
another way, like...

18:04.158 --> 18:07.759
lower and wider and... both.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.363
Why do I feel like
you are stalling?

18:10.398 --> 18:12.665
No, no. I'm not stalling.

18:12.700 --> 18:13.869
I just... I think we should
get to know each other.

18:13.893 --> 18:17.537
You know, I don't just go up
on a high-wire with anyone.

18:17.572 --> 18:19.738
So, what are you into?
You like art?

18:19.773 --> 18:20.893
Ever been to an art gallery?

18:24.178 --> 18:25.178
Hey!

18:26.889 --> 18:28.097
Hello, there, little crab man.

18:30.726 --> 18:32.501
I would shake your hand,
but you're...

18:32.536 --> 18:33.896
currently using them
to walk, so...

18:35.556 --> 18:37.764
Hi, I'm Kimmy,
the new tightrope walker.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.767
Why are you telling me?
I don't know you.

18:39.802 --> 18:40.842
I don't talk to strangers.

18:42.513 --> 18:43.657
That guy's all
bent out of shape.

18:43.681 --> 18:45.305
What's his deal?

18:45.341 --> 18:47.174
Totally paranoid.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.001
Always looking over
his shoulder...

18:49.036 --> 18:50.161
and other body parts.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.416
Paranoid and can fit
into small spaces.

18:55.451 --> 18:57.211
Good to know. JEFF: Are
you talkin' about me?

19:04.978 --> 19:07.961
Gotta be honest.
This isn't working.

19:07.997 --> 19:10.322
Yeah, well, next time
try ordering a salad.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.483
I told you the sardine pineapple
pizza was a bad idea.

19:12.519 --> 19:15.085
No, I mean us.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.222
This blackmailing thing
doesn't have

19:16.246 --> 19:18.406
the spontaneity it used to.

19:18.482 --> 19:20.227
I threaten to tell K.C.,
you take me fun places.

19:20.251 --> 19:21.770
I threaten to tell K.C.,
you take me fun places.

19:21.794 --> 19:22.926
Where's the magic?

19:22.962 --> 19:25.262
Where's the spark?

19:25.297 --> 19:28.131
Oh, so it's my fault
we're stuck in this rut?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.441
It takes two to tango, mister.

19:29.476 --> 19:31.210
Tango!

19:31.245 --> 19:31.886
That would be
a great change of pace.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.046
We never go dancing.

19:34.123 --> 19:36.031
Well, I don't see you
making much of an effort.

19:36.066 --> 19:37.249
Stop criticizing me, woman!

19:39.153 --> 19:41.028
Oh, my goodness.

19:41.063 --> 19:43.013
I am dating a nine-year-old.

19:43.048 --> 19:45.449
And the worst part is,

19:45.484 --> 19:47.324
this is the longest relationship
I've ever had.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.810
Please. Child's play.

20:05.028 --> 20:07.146
Great work, everybody!

20:07.181 --> 20:10.541
Tomorrow we perform
for the crowd.

20:10.576 --> 20:12.243
You know, if anyone
actually shows up.

20:14.581 --> 20:15.581
Guys. Guys.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.541
OK. Let's review the suspects.

20:19.576 --> 20:22.377
There's DeVille, the sad
sack owner of the circus.

20:22.413 --> 20:23.607
Definitely has
a motive to steal.

20:23.631 --> 20:26.348
( Sobbing )

20:26.383 --> 20:29.668
And to see a therapist.

20:29.703 --> 20:32.313
Agreed, but, if he stole millions
of dollars' worth of art,

20:32.348 --> 20:33.972
then why is he
still in such a bad mood?

20:34.007 --> 20:35.567
We need to keep an eye on him.
OK, Judy?

20:37.544 --> 20:38.544
Judy!

20:40.205 --> 20:42.147
Yeah. Yeah.
Watch DeVille. Got it.

20:45.403 --> 20:47.536
What's up with this
Laszlo guy you're working with?

20:47.572 --> 20:49.249
Well, I mean, he keeps complaining
about not getting paid,

20:49.273 --> 20:50.839
but the jury's still out on him.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.875
But not his abs...
They're guilty of being perfect.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.705
Any suspects
other than Mr. Good Core?

20:59.650 --> 21:01.733
I did meet this one girl.

21:01.769 --> 21:02.960
She's the warmest,

21:02.995 --> 21:06.171
most beautiful, elegant
creature I've ever seen.

21:06.207 --> 21:07.407
What's her name? Wacky Jackie.

21:09.994 --> 21:11.827
I really like her,
and I think she likes me.

21:11.862 --> 21:13.902
Well, then, Jackie is definitely wacky.
( chuckles )

21:23.757 --> 21:25.166
Oh...

21:25.201 --> 21:26.842
look at that. A rose!

21:26.878 --> 21:29.803
That is so sweet.

21:29.839 --> 21:32.359
Look, I'm sorry to break it to
you, but I don't date co-workers.

21:34.034 --> 21:36.252
"Kimmy, I know why
you're really here.

21:36.287 --> 21:37.844
"I have information
that can help you.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.640
Meet me in the storage room
in five minutes."

21:40.674 --> 21:41.674
Did you write this?

21:43.193 --> 21:45.786
Stop licking me.

21:45.821 --> 21:48.421
What part of "it's not happening"
do you not understand, Frenchie?

21:49.959 --> 21:51.767
( Door opens )

21:51.802 --> 21:55.229
Hey! Yoo-hoo! It's me.

21:55.264 --> 21:56.264
Kimmy. ( Chuckles )

21:57.858 --> 21:59.018
( turns switches on and off )

22:01.596 --> 22:03.437
Came to talk. I got your letter.

22:03.472 --> 22:04.521
( Door shuts )

22:05.891 --> 22:06.948
( door locked )

22:06.984 --> 22:07.741
( growling )

22:07.777 --> 22:11.045
Oh!

22:11.080 --> 22:13.689
OK, um, you know what?

22:13.724 --> 22:17.451
Now is a great time to discuss the
merits of bein' a vegetarian.

22:22.850 --> 22:24.208
( Rattling lock )

22:27.880 --> 22:29.972
( growling )

22:30.007 --> 22:32.324
Come on. ( Panting )

22:32.359 --> 22:33.325
You guys really
don't wanna do this.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.995
I mean, look at me. I barely
got any meat on my bones.

22:36.030 --> 22:37.700
I would be a lot of work
for a little dinner.

22:37.724 --> 22:38.872
( Growling )

22:38.908 --> 22:42.676
Help! Help! Help!

22:42.711 --> 22:44.228
Did someone call for help?

22:45.681 --> 22:47.782
( Low growls )

22:47.858 --> 22:50.134
Yeah, this whole rushing-in-
and-saving-me thing,

22:50.169 --> 22:51.568
not makin' you
any less attractive.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.899
So, McCoy is
still stuck in prison

22:57.935 --> 23:00.436
and we have no idea
who the actual thief is.

23:00.471 --> 23:01.857
But you know what?
I'll tell you who it isn't.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.280
Laszlo. If it wasn't for him...

23:03.315 --> 23:06.325
Those tigers
would have K.C. breath?

23:06.360 --> 23:09.411
Be poopin' out flannel tomorrow?

23:09.446 --> 23:11.806
I was going to say flossing
pieces of me out of their teeth,

23:11.840 --> 23:12.934
but you know what?
I like your's better.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.708
KIRA: Uh, Judy,

23:14.743 --> 23:16.377
can you analyze the handwriting

23:16.412 --> 23:17.795
and tell us who wrote this note?

23:17.830 --> 23:20.105
I would say
this was written by...

23:20.140 --> 23:23.592
someone with access to a pen.

23:23.628 --> 23:26.161
Seriously, people, I need
samples to compare it to.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.196
I am not a machine.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.465
OK. I am a machine,

23:30.500 --> 23:31.900
but I do need
samples to compare to.

23:33.529 --> 23:36.705
( Sneezing )

23:36.740 --> 23:38.724
Dad, why are you
wearing your glasses?

23:38.759 --> 23:40.934
I can't wear my contacts.
My eyes are on fire.

23:40.969 --> 23:43.370
Yeah. He's allergic
to those adorable tigers

23:43.405 --> 23:45.397
but he doesn't wanna
complain about it...

23:45.433 --> 23:46.623
To anybody but me.

23:50.278 --> 23:51.982
You know, Dad, with those glasses
on, you kinda remind of someone.

23:52.006 --> 23:54.846
You know, I feel bad for anybody who
has to look like this all the time.

23:57.778 --> 23:58.778
Looking good, Dad.

24:01.165 --> 24:03.215
Ah, I know you look like someone

24:03.250 --> 24:04.530
but I cannot put
my finger on it.

24:08.547 --> 24:10.597
Uh, anyway.
Guys, let's focus, OK?

24:10.632 --> 24:12.007
Let's do what we do best.

24:12.043 --> 24:13.043
BOTH: Eat dinner?

24:14.895 --> 24:16.419
No. Complete this mission.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.231
Like the highly qualified spies

24:19.266 --> 24:22.359
four out of five of us
actually are.

24:22.395 --> 24:24.569
Now, we need everyone's
handwriting samples.

24:24.605 --> 24:27.347
I'll get Wacky Jackie's,
and if she's guilty,

24:27.382 --> 24:29.663
I'll see if she can be redeemed
by the love of a good man.

24:31.828 --> 24:33.106
You know what? I got it.
I know who you look like.

24:33.130 --> 24:34.504
Don Cheadle.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.397
( laughing ) Yeah. Yeah.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.091
No. No, no. That's not it.

24:40.496 --> 24:41.970
Man!
This is gonna bug me all day.

24:48.779 --> 24:51.346
Good thing I'm fire-retardant.

24:51.381 --> 24:53.582
Judini, wait! Wait! Wait!

24:53.617 --> 24:55.300
( Sighs )

24:55.335 --> 24:56.760
Are you going to
talk me out of this

24:56.795 --> 24:58.645
because it's not safe
for an adult,

24:58.680 --> 25:00.605
let alone a nine-year-old?

25:00.641 --> 25:02.161
Heck no! I just didn't
want to miss it!

25:03.977 --> 25:05.044
But be careful.

25:05.079 --> 25:11.900
The Cecil B. DeVille Circus
does not have insurance.

25:11.936 --> 25:14.306
So what happens if your fancy art
collection goes up in flames?

25:14.330 --> 25:15.587
My what? Never mind.

25:21.212 --> 25:23.595
Whoo-hoo! Yeah, baby!

25:24.940 --> 25:27.015
( laughing )

25:30.012 --> 25:31.661
Not bad, huh?

25:31.697 --> 25:34.455
Judini, that was incredible!

25:34.491 --> 25:36.642
You're my new star headliner.

25:36.677 --> 25:37.776
Can I get that in writing?

25:42.750 --> 25:45.017
So, Wacky Jackie...

25:45.052 --> 25:46.952
Oh, don't be so formal.
Call me Wacky.

25:46.987 --> 25:50.581
OK. I've been thinking about
our act, Wacky Jackie...

25:50.616 --> 25:52.249
I mean, Wacky.

25:54.570 --> 25:56.870
Right now, I pour seltzer
down your pants,

25:56.905 --> 25:58.216
you hit me
with the rubber chicken,

25:58.240 --> 25:59.715
then I cough out feathers.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.083
But...

26:01.118 --> 26:02.609
what if instead

26:02.645 --> 26:04.211
I spray<i> you</i> with seltzer?

26:04.246 --> 26:06.613
Oh, I love that!

26:06.649 --> 26:08.816
Ernie, you're the funniest
guy I've ever met.

26:08.851 --> 26:10.817
And I've worked with
Jingles The Clown.

26:10.853 --> 26:12.561
High praise!

26:12.596 --> 26:14.871
Oh, by the way,

26:14.907 --> 26:16.915
it's Mitzi the Dancing
Poodle's birthday today,

26:16.951 --> 26:17.960
and I'm passing around a card.

26:17.984 --> 26:19.785
Everyone's signing it.

26:19.820 --> 26:22.571
And if you could somehow
work the words

26:22.606 --> 26:24.206
"storage room" in there,
that'd be great.

26:30.063 --> 26:31.688
Hop on.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.373
You know, I would,

26:33.408 --> 26:34.786
but I did a spinning class
this morning.

26:34.810 --> 26:36.310
Come on.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.878
You know, I'm just...

26:37.913 --> 26:40.530
I'm not really a huge fan
of the whole,

26:40.565 --> 26:42.582
you know,
bike-on-a-tightrope thing.

26:42.618 --> 26:45.452
It's a little "been there,
I don't want to do that."

26:45.488 --> 26:47.203
Don't be nervous.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.772
Nothing can go wrong

26:48.807 --> 26:50.248
as long as the net is there.

26:50.284 --> 26:52.517
Of course. Hup.

26:52.553 --> 26:53.560
OK. ( Clears throat )

26:55.964 --> 26:56.964
Oooh.

27:10.713 --> 27:11.753
KC: Oh, oh, OK. All right.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.499
What ya doin'?
( nervous chuckles )

27:18.036 --> 27:19.036
Hup!

27:30.124 --> 27:32.141
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

27:32.176 --> 27:33.350
( KC grunts )

27:40.376 --> 27:42.551
Hop on.

27:42.586 --> 27:45.404
Ride back to the platform?
Don't mind if I do.

27:45.439 --> 27:46.780
Hup!

27:46.815 --> 27:48.473
OK.

27:48.509 --> 27:51.059
Oooh...

27:51.095 --> 27:52.244
All right.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.745
This is good.

28:04.233 --> 28:05.632
You're very good...

28:05.667 --> 28:07.659
( both chuckle )

28:07.695 --> 28:09.119
for a beginner.

28:09.155 --> 28:10.737
Beginner? Please,

28:10.773 --> 28:12.940
I have been doing this
my whole life.

28:13.016 --> 28:14.976
In fact, I came out
walking on the umbilical cord.

28:19.782 --> 28:22.566
KC: I don't know why
you'd think I'm a beginner.

28:22.601 --> 28:25.360
LASZLO: Well, considering one of
your fingernails is stuck in my arm

28:25.395 --> 28:26.998
from when you were holding
on to it for dear life,

28:27.022 --> 28:28.805
I'd say there's a chance

28:28.840 --> 28:30.200
you're not being
completely honest.

28:32.219 --> 28:33.743
Come on.

28:33.779 --> 28:36.530
Tell me whats really going on.

28:36.565 --> 28:37.873
You know you can trust me.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.585
All right.

28:44.214 --> 28:47.282
But, listen. You have to swear

28:47.318 --> 28:48.199
that you won't tell anybody, or else
it could be the end of my career.

28:48.235 --> 28:49.593
I swear.

28:49.628 --> 28:52.479
OK.

28:52.514 --> 28:54.066
Look, there's been
a string of art heists

28:54.090 --> 28:56.574
and I have been assigned
to find the thief.

28:56.610 --> 28:57.770
I'm actually an undercover...

29:01.365 --> 29:02.564
insurance adjuster.

29:05.369 --> 29:08.996
Yup. Just as glamorous
as it sounds.

29:09.031 --> 29:12.891
An art thief? Huh.
Do you have any leads?

29:12.926 --> 29:14.404
Well, right now,
I'm thinking it's the tigers,

29:14.428 --> 29:17.362
but that's probably an overly
emotional, biased response

29:17.397 --> 29:20.081
to them trying to eat me!

29:20.116 --> 29:23.810
OK, I am not a secret
undercover insurance adjuster

29:23.845 --> 29:26.104
like you,

29:26.140 --> 29:27.580
but you know
who I think it could be?

29:29.852 --> 29:32.794
Jeff the creepy contortionist.

29:32.829 --> 29:35.739
You know what? You may be right.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.403
My mom always told me never trust a
guy who blows his nose upside down...

29:38.427 --> 29:39.518
with his feet.

29:48.303 --> 29:50.545
Oh, wow!

29:50.581 --> 29:52.030
Your butt's a built-in
coffee table!

29:55.711 --> 29:56.947
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

29:56.971 --> 29:58.511
Am I being fired?

29:58.547 --> 30:00.297
Is there a fire?
Where are the exits?

30:00.332 --> 30:02.890
( Chuckles ) You're so silly!

30:02.926 --> 30:04.826
No. I'm just your biggest fan.

30:04.861 --> 30:07.120
Even though
I'm only four feet tall.

30:07.156 --> 30:09.206
But my mom says if I eat
my fruits and vegetables

30:09.241 --> 30:12.191
I'll grow big and strong!

30:12.227 --> 30:14.527
Well, could you grow
somewhere else?

30:14.563 --> 30:15.437
I just wanted your autograph.

30:15.472 --> 30:16.472
I don't do autographs.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.516
( Cries )

30:23.146 --> 30:24.437
OK, you can have my autograph!

30:24.473 --> 30:25.564
Just please stop crying.

30:33.173 --> 30:35.824
Can you make it out to Amy?

30:35.859 --> 30:37.445
( Softly ) Oh, dang.
I need more letters.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.029
Uh, can you make it
out to my full name?

30:40.331 --> 30:42.306
I am Amy...

30:42.341 --> 30:44.082
Jingleheimerschmidt.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.429
Ow! Cramp! Cramp!

30:49.464 --> 30:52.399
Hey! Work through
the pain, Bendy Boy!

30:52.434 --> 30:55.510
Oh, I'm sorry. I think I got
a little froggy in my throat.

30:59.449 --> 31:02.083
MARISA: Look, Petey, I think
this is our last hurrah.

31:02.118 --> 31:03.885
I need an actual boyfriend,

31:03.920 --> 31:05.645
and you need to be home by 8:00,

31:05.681 --> 31:08.481
so I don't see this working out.

31:08.516 --> 31:10.433
Yeah, I'm over you, too.
It's been real.

31:10.468 --> 31:12.644
Um, no, no, no.

31:12.679 --> 31:14.104
You're not letting me down easy,

31:14.139 --> 31:15.447
I am letting <i>you</i> down easy!

31:17.667 --> 31:19.259
( Trumpet playing )

31:19.294 --> 31:21.036
( audience cheers )

31:23.515 --> 31:24.581
( whistle blows )

31:33.834 --> 31:34.834
( nose honks )

31:50.992 --> 31:53.026
( cheers, applause )

32:08.802 --> 32:11.419
( Petey screaming )

32:24.250 --> 32:25.433
Yeah!

34:24.938 --> 34:26.897
Hey, don't those circus people

34:26.932 --> 34:28.715
kinda look a little
like the Coopers?

34:28.750 --> 34:30.775
I am not speaking to you.

34:30.810 --> 34:33.061
We will enjoy the show,

34:33.096 --> 34:35.396
and then go our separate ways,
as per your wishes.

34:37.233 --> 34:39.534
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:39.569 --> 34:42.311
I am your ringmaster,
Cecil B. DeVille,

34:42.347 --> 34:45.840
welcoming you to the greatest
circus in the world!

34:45.875 --> 34:46.875
Don't fact check that.

34:48.770 --> 34:50.946
And now, for our first act,

34:50.981 --> 34:54.582
Wacky Jackie
and her Big Top Clowns!

34:56.461 --> 34:58.169
( Audience cheering )

35:54.520 --> 35:55.560
( laughter )

36:17.258 --> 36:18.291
( clang )

36:20.119 --> 36:23.213
That weird, pathetic clown
kinda reminds me of Ernie.

36:31.873 --> 36:33.898
It<i> is</i> Ernie!

36:33.933 --> 36:36.568
Uh, uh, Earnie? Yeah, right.

36:36.686 --> 36:40.004
I admit he's a clown,
but he's not a professional.

36:40.039 --> 36:41.242
I'm gonna go see
what I can find out.

36:41.266 --> 36:43.033
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.955
Uh, new act is coming out.
Don't want to miss it.

36:48.072 --> 36:52.701
KC, I just completed analyzing the writing
samples, and none of them are a match.

36:52.736 --> 36:55.503
But someone at the circus has got
to be involved with the art theft.

36:55.580 --> 36:56.974
McCoy is still in jail,
and we need to help him.

36:56.998 --> 36:58.406
What am I not seeing?

36:58.441 --> 37:00.241
Laszlo. What about Laszlo?

37:00.276 --> 37:01.843
No. I'm definitely
seeing Laszlo.

37:01.878 --> 37:03.770
I like what I see, OK?

37:03.805 --> 37:06.464
No. Not OK.

37:06.500 --> 37:09.258
We never got his writing sample.

37:09.294 --> 37:10.513
But he's cool. Remember? I told you, he's
the one who saved me from the tigers.

37:10.537 --> 37:13.346
Or, he's the one who tried
to<i> feed</i> you to the tigers.

37:13.381 --> 37:14.639
What? No! No.

37:14.674 --> 37:16.499
Think about it.

37:16.534 --> 37:18.710
He just so happened to
have a side of raw beef

37:18.745 --> 37:20.153
when he walked by
the storage room?

37:20.188 --> 37:23.013
I am sure that there is some

37:23.049 --> 37:25.242
logical explanation for
why that would happen.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.185
I mean, he was probably
just cooking some dinner,

37:27.220 --> 37:29.203
heard me yelling for help,

37:29.238 --> 37:31.030
and made a split-second decision

37:31.065 --> 37:33.675
to sacrifice his uncooked
filet mignon in order to...

37:33.710 --> 37:34.710
Yeah, I got played.

37:36.913 --> 37:39.647
And now, tiger lovers,

37:39.682 --> 37:42.149
The Amazing Wayne and Wanda!

37:42.185 --> 37:43.994
Or, truth be told,

37:44.029 --> 37:46.596
The Pretty Good Wayne and Wanda!

37:46.631 --> 37:48.915
Oh, who am I kidding?

37:48.950 --> 37:51.350
The "They Were Available at the
Last Minute Wayne And Wanda."

37:56.558 --> 37:58.908
( sneezing )

37:58.943 --> 38:01.055
We're in the middle of a show!
Will you stop sneezing?

38:01.079 --> 38:02.962
Those giant cats
are giving me hives!

38:02.997 --> 38:04.188
They're making me all itchy.

38:04.224 --> 38:05.423
You want to talk itchy?

38:05.458 --> 38:08.292
Get back to me when you're
wearing gold lam drawers!

38:08.328 --> 38:09.368
Now pick up that hoop. OK.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.518
( Tigers growling )

38:16.553 --> 38:19.145
You know what? I just figured
out who you look like.

38:19.180 --> 38:20.597
And it definitely
ain't Don Cheadle.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.707
( Tigers growling )

38:22.742 --> 38:25.710
Oh, come on. You can't
tell me that doesn't look

38:25.746 --> 38:27.328
exactly like Mrs. Cooper and...

38:27.363 --> 38:29.339
kind of an older
version of Ernie.

38:31.601 --> 38:34.068
Oh, so now everybody
looks like Ernie?

38:34.104 --> 38:35.686
( Chuckles ) I don't know.

38:35.721 --> 38:37.963
Something's going on,

38:37.999 --> 38:39.879
and trust me, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.620
But first,

38:44.656 --> 38:46.176
I'm going to get
to the bottom of this!

38:47.909 --> 38:49.500
( Tigers growling ) Up-up!

38:49.535 --> 38:51.218
Good girl.

38:51.253 --> 38:52.779
Up-up! ( Tigers growling )

38:52.814 --> 38:55.048
Yes.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.824
And up-up!

38:58.753 --> 39:01.537
( Cheers, applause )

39:05.268 --> 39:07.201
( Craig sneezing )

39:07.236 --> 39:10.138
Craig, I got a crazy idea.

39:10.215 --> 39:12.198
Crazier than us pretending
to be tiger tamers?

39:12.233 --> 39:14.801
I've gotten attached
to these guys.

39:14.836 --> 39:18.554
And they don't belong at the circus
in a cage. They deserve a good home.

39:18.589 --> 39:20.415
You'd better not be
talking about<i> our</i> house.

39:20.450 --> 39:22.210
We don't have room
for a litter box that big!

39:22.243 --> 39:25.919
No. We are sneaking them
out of here.

39:25.955 --> 39:27.516
I found a sanctuary that will
feed them and take care of them.

39:27.540 --> 39:30.858
For free? Can we send the kids
there instead of college?

39:30.894 --> 39:32.151
Ow! Just asking! Achoo!

39:39.744 --> 39:41.219
KC: ( thinking )
<i>All right, Laszlo,</i>

39:41.254 --> 39:43.974
<i>there's gotta be proof that you're
the art thief in here somewhere.</i>

39:49.537 --> 39:51.271
<i>Ugh! Why isn't there
anything here?</i>

39:51.306 --> 39:53.881
<i>Unless I'm wrong</i>

39:53.916 --> 39:55.244
<i>and you are as sweet
on the inside</i>

39:55.268 --> 39:57.093
<i>as you are on the outside.</i>

40:12.518 --> 40:14.102
Hey!

40:14.137 --> 40:17.288
What are you doing in here?

40:17.365 --> 40:20.883
It's my dressing room.
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

40:20.919 --> 40:23.461
Oh, right. Um, I stopped
by to say goodbye.

40:23.497 --> 40:27.990
Yeah, um, turns out nobody at this
circus is part of the art theft,

40:28.026 --> 40:30.985
so the insurance company
assigned me to a different case.

40:31.020 --> 40:32.748
Yeah, something about
someone got rear-ended,

40:32.772 --> 40:36.633
or somebody's rear end not
turning out right. I don't know.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.949
Either I'll be talking to a
mechanic or a plastic surgeon.

40:39.879 --> 40:41.637
Well, toodles.

40:44.417 --> 40:47.084
Well, wait! You can't leave yet.

40:47.119 --> 40:50.087
It's almost time
for our performance,

40:50.122 --> 40:53.015
and Laszlo needs a partner.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.151
You've gotten so good
at the routine, and...

40:58.390 --> 41:00.072
we can't disappoint
all those little kids.

41:03.028 --> 41:05.461
Awright. ( Chuckles )

41:05.496 --> 41:06.496
I guess it's showtime!

41:09.967 --> 41:11.901
Oh, yes...

41:11.937 --> 41:13.085
It's definitely...

41:14.472 --> 41:15.588
showtime.

41:25.575 --> 41:28.417
Hey! That poodle and I
have the same haircut!

41:28.452 --> 41:31.495
Earnie.
Earnie, what are you doing?

41:31.531 --> 41:32.989
Waiting for
the poodle act to finish.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.657
I want to give Mitzi
her birthday card.

41:34.692 --> 41:36.317
Aw, how cute is that? Focus!

41:38.613 --> 41:41.063
Look, I need you sneak into
Laszlo's dressing room

41:41.098 --> 41:42.877
and see if you can get any evidence
tying him to the art theft.

41:42.901 --> 41:44.325
All right,
let me set a reminder.

41:48.005 --> 41:51.023
If you could do all this before
I have to get on that highwire.

41:51.059 --> 41:53.517
Walking on a tightrope is not
necessarily a walk in the park.

41:53.553 --> 41:55.936
Relax. There's a net.
It's not that big a deal.

41:55.972 --> 41:58.038
Said the boy who freaks out

41:58.074 --> 41:59.376
when his peas touches
his mashed potatoes.

41:59.400 --> 42:00.967
They're not meant to touch!

42:05.649 --> 42:10.118
And now, direct your eyes
to The Great Judini!

42:10.153 --> 42:11.352
( Cheers, applause )

42:16.876 --> 42:18.525
OK, I'm not crazy!

42:18.561 --> 42:20.919
That's Judy! That's Judy!

42:20.955 --> 42:23.238
( Chuckles )
You are being ridiculous.

42:23.274 --> 42:24.274
Here, have some popcorn.

42:28.287 --> 42:30.062
Are you ready, Judini?

42:30.097 --> 42:32.498
I came out of the box ready.

42:32.534 --> 42:33.958
Beam me up, Shorty Bop!

42:40.433 --> 42:42.758
<i>Bon voyage,</i> money maker!

42:44.212 --> 42:45.102
JUDY: Whoo-hoo!

42:45.138 --> 42:47.722
Hey, Petey!

42:47.757 --> 42:48.806
How ya doin'?

42:55.030 --> 42:57.798
What do you say now? You still
don't think that's Judy?

42:57.833 --> 42:59.984
I guess I see
a passing resemblance.

43:02.838 --> 43:06.741
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

43:06.776 --> 43:10.811
the Cecil B. DeVille Traveling
Circus is proud to present

43:10.846 --> 43:14.290
the high-wire act
beyond compare,

43:14.326 --> 43:17.310
the circus star extraordinaire,

43:17.345 --> 43:19.954
the one, the only...

43:19.989 --> 43:21.797
Laszlo!

43:23.718 --> 43:26.152
Wow, I'm suddenly
enjoying the circus.

43:26.187 --> 43:28.278
And my beautiful...

43:28.314 --> 43:29.764
( softly ) and temporary...

43:29.799 --> 43:31.557
partner, Kimmy!

43:33.802 --> 43:36.921
Kimmy, my Aunt Franny!
That's KC Cooper!

43:36.956 --> 43:38.639
MARISA: I don't think so.

43:38.675 --> 43:40.682
PETEY: Oh, come on!
She's your best friend!

43:40.718 --> 43:42.401
How can you not
recognize your best friend?

43:47.116 --> 43:50.517
<i>( Two-way radio beeps )</i> Perfect
timing, bro. What's up?

43:50.553 --> 43:53.546
ERNIE:<i> I'm in Laszlo's dressing room.
You need to know two things.</i>

43:53.581 --> 43:56.093
First, I found the blueprints to every
single art gallery that was robbed.

43:56.117 --> 43:57.341
He's our guy.

43:57.376 --> 43:58.926
What's the other thing?

43:58.961 --> 43:59.927
<i>I found lip prints</i>

43:59.962 --> 44:01.245
all over his headshot.

44:01.281 --> 44:04.898
<i>I think he's been making out
with his own photo.</i>

44:04.934 --> 44:07.234
He's a weirdo! Be careful!

44:07.270 --> 44:08.561
KC:<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

44:08.596 --> 44:09.386
<i>I just got to do
this performance,</i>

44:09.422 --> 44:10.971
then I'll take him down.

44:11.006 --> 44:14.174
And now, before we begin
our performance,

44:14.210 --> 44:17.829
I ask Mr. DeVille
to remove the safety nets!

44:17.864 --> 44:19.980
Remove the what now?

44:39.010 --> 44:41.794
Come on, Kimmy! Let's do this!

44:41.830 --> 44:44.881
Ya know, I would,
I really would,

44:44.916 --> 44:47.675
but, uh, I just remembered I have
some really important plans tonight

44:47.710 --> 44:50.477
with some friends of mine...
The bones in my body...

44:50.513 --> 44:52.753
And I don't really want to
break my plans... or my bones.

44:54.700 --> 44:56.742
Relax, it's just like
we rehearsed.

44:56.777 --> 44:59.161
One step at a time.

44:59.197 --> 45:02.698
You trust me... don't you?

45:02.734 --> 45:03.983
( Exhales )

45:10.216 --> 45:11.907
( audience gasps )

45:15.713 --> 45:19.039
Excellent, Kimmy.
Or should I say...

45:25.906 --> 45:27.498
KC!

45:27.533 --> 45:29.499
Wh-wh-what are you
talking about?

45:29.535 --> 45:30.434
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

45:30.469 --> 45:32.720
You're not
an insurance adjuster,

45:32.755 --> 45:35.222
You're here to bust me
for those art heists.

45:35.257 --> 45:37.017
OK, so you do know
what you're talking about.

45:39.587 --> 45:41.603
I guess the game's over.
I'm taking you in.

45:41.639 --> 45:43.964
( Scoffs ) As we say in Romania,

45:44.000 --> 45:45.299
I don't think so.

45:45.335 --> 45:46.442
( Audience gasps )

45:48.771 --> 45:50.324
Listen, that is not
a Romania thing, OK?

45:50.348 --> 45:51.708
They literally
say that everywhere.

45:55.820 --> 45:56.827
( KC grunts )

46:00.308 --> 46:01.308
( Laszlo grunts )

46:12.987 --> 46:14.732
So how did you get
in the gallery that night?

46:14.756 --> 46:16.036
Tightrope from
the next building?

46:18.076 --> 46:19.725
( Audience gasps )

46:21.787 --> 46:24.697
Well, it's no secret
I'm an expert with ropes.

46:24.732 --> 46:26.212
Which is how I'll be
making my escape.

46:36.202 --> 46:38.711
Mom, the Coopers are in a circus

46:38.746 --> 46:41.330
and some guy just
pulled a gun on Marisa!

46:41.365 --> 46:43.199
Yes, it's true!

46:43.234 --> 46:44.908
Pick me up, Mom!

46:44.943 --> 46:48.154
Mom!!!

46:48.189 --> 46:50.823
( Spectators screaming )
Relax! Relax, everybody!

46:50.858 --> 46:53.000
It's all a part of the act.

46:53.036 --> 46:55.156
Sheesh! Am I the only one
who understands showmanship?

47:01.327 --> 47:02.935
AUDIENCE: Whoa!!!

47:05.497 --> 47:07.723
There seems to be
a huge mistake.

47:07.758 --> 47:09.750
I'm not a part
of this spy stuff.

47:09.786 --> 47:12.136
I just wanted to steal
a book report!

47:12.171 --> 47:13.390
Hey! You leave that
poor girl alone!

47:13.414 --> 47:15.072
Poor girl?

47:15.108 --> 47:19.101
Don't you mean your best friend?

47:19.136 --> 47:21.462
What? I have never met that
girl in my entire life!

47:21.497 --> 47:23.639
Yeah. Yeah, it's true.

47:23.675 --> 47:26.926
I have no idea who
KC Coretta Scott King Cooper is,

47:27.003 --> 47:28.883
and she is definitely not
my next-door neighbor.

47:31.791 --> 47:35.309
OK, maybe we've met a few times!

47:35.344 --> 47:37.010
Don't try to follow me

47:37.046 --> 47:39.104
or you'll never see her again!

47:39.140 --> 47:40.140
KC, help me!

47:54.205 --> 47:56.464
( Audience cheers )

47:56.499 --> 47:57.990
Thank you. Thank you.

48:01.254 --> 48:04.070
Thank you. Thank you.
(chuckles )

48:04.106 --> 48:06.015
Hey, look at that Laszlo,
you were right.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.791
I didn't need a net.

48:07.827 --> 48:09.107
But you are gonna need a lawyer.

48:16.360 --> 48:18.802
All rise for the Honorable
Dudley Theopolis.

48:20.973 --> 48:22.781
And just to be clear...

48:22.817 --> 48:25.392
I am the Honorable
Dudley Theopolis!

48:27.930 --> 48:30.064
Now all sit for the
Honorable Dudley Theopolis.

48:32.326 --> 48:33.326
Now stand.

48:35.438 --> 48:38.139
Ha ha! Gotcha.

48:38.174 --> 48:40.607
I didn't say, "for the
Honorable Dudley Theopolis."

48:40.642 --> 48:43.644
You're all out!

48:43.679 --> 48:46.288
Ha ha!
Gets 'em every time, don't it?

48:48.760 --> 48:50.868
All right, let's get
down to business.

48:50.903 --> 48:52.978
I have reviewed the new evidence

48:53.014 --> 48:58.367
provided by Agent 8433599.

48:58.402 --> 49:01.945
Now that Laszlo, the true
art thief, is behind bars,

49:01.981 --> 49:04.248
I hereby overturn
the previous ruling

49:04.283 --> 49:07.159
and find the defendant
Bob McCoy...

49:07.194 --> 49:08.844
not guilty!

49:08.879 --> 49:10.512
Whoo!

49:10.547 --> 49:11.547
Court adjourned!

49:13.859 --> 49:15.036
I don't know how to thank you!

49:15.060 --> 49:16.213
Hey, I'm just glad
that justice prevailed.

49:16.237 --> 49:17.237
( Chuckles )

49:19.215 --> 49:20.939
Good work, Agent.

49:20.975 --> 49:23.200
Thank you. It was an
honor, Your Honor.

49:23.236 --> 49:25.252
You're one smart cookie.

49:25.287 --> 49:27.029
Right back atcha. ( Chuckles )

49:27.064 --> 49:29.081
All right, now.

49:33.262 --> 49:34.553
WOMAN: Rob, your name's on TV!

49:34.589 --> 49:35.589
<i>( Boing )</i>
