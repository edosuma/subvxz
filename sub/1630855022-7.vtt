00:23.857 --> 00:29.404
Welcome to Giorgio's,
where everyone is mi familia!

00:30.489 --> 00:31.657
It's true.

00:31.657 --> 00:35.536
My restaurant, or restaurante, en Italia,
is all about family.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.497
One day, I'd love to have one
of my own, you know?

00:38.497 --> 00:42.459
Like, seeing Principal Pat tonight
being so happy

00:42.459 --> 00:44.127
got me thinking about the future.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.797
Do you ever think about the future,
Hana-Banana?

00:48.215 --> 00:49.967
I try not to.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.095
Yeah.
I guess the present is pretty cool too.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.639
Hey, you know, I gotta say,

00:55.639 --> 00:58.559
I'm all about a little late-night
drop-in lovemaking session.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.395
Only question is, what are we now?

01:01.395 --> 01:06.567
Boyfriend-girlfriend, or little FWBs,
aka friends with bennies, or...

01:06.567 --> 01:08.402
- I'm gonna go.
- Oh, yeah, totally.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.153
I was gonna say that same thing.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.541
Mamma mia.

01:44.104 --> 01:48.358
Last night's dinner service
was an embarrassment.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.777
There were tables without bread bowls,

01:50.777 --> 01:53.405
over-pours that cost me an arm and a leg.

01:53.405 --> 01:57.326
And Carl, the shrimp scampi was as fresh

01:57.326 --> 02:00.579
as my ProProtect compression leggings
after a 10K run.

02:00.579 --> 02:03.373
I can't help if you
ordered dated frozen shrimp.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.875
Excuses!

02:04.875 --> 02:08.252
You know who doesn't make excuses?
Legends.

02:08.836 --> 02:12.799
All over this restaurant,
you will find photos

02:12.799 --> 02:16.011
and memorabilia of sports legends

02:16.011 --> 02:19.056
who all have one thing in common.

02:19.056 --> 02:23.310
And it just so happens to be
the number one rule here at Giorgio's.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.979
Does anybody remember what that rule is?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.357
- Don't jizz in the minestrone soup?
- Character!

02:28.357 --> 02:32.778
And we will need that in spades
at tonight's fundraiser.

02:32.778 --> 02:38.283
We have been entrusted
with this event by Cass Hubbard,

02:38.283 --> 02:41.119
a woman who is extremely important,

02:41.119 --> 02:45.123
extremely intelligent
and extremely sensual.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.919
Now, as we've discussed,
you will all be wearing

02:48.919 --> 02:51.505
"Ask me about my potential" polos.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.382
And so I'm not taken off guard
if one of you

02:53.382 --> 02:55.634
has an extremely embarrassing potential,

02:55.634 --> 02:57.261
I asked you all
to show me your MORPHO cards.

02:57.261 --> 02:58.345
Fascist.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.389
Very funny, Raymond! I'm not a fascist.

03:00.389 --> 03:03.976
Now, line up single file
so I can inspect your cards.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.519
Okay.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.898
"Lawyer." All right.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.111
"Real Estate Agent." Boring, but fine.

03:15.904 --> 03:19.116
"Cartographer."
A little late in the game, but okay.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.542
"Gum." You got "Gum"?
What does that even mean?

03:28.542 --> 03:29.751
I have no idea.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.712
Yeah, okay.
Well, that's a big no bueno for me.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.255
You're back of house tonight, Gum.

03:39.178 --> 03:43.849
"Gondolier"?
Well, okay, this pisses me off, Trina!

03:43.849 --> 03:46.852
You got "Gondolier,"
and you weren't gonna tell me?

03:49.646 --> 03:53.567
You're in the canal tonight.
And you deserve this.

03:58.322 --> 04:01.742
Cassandra Hubbard, look at you!

04:01.742 --> 04:04.411
- Stunning. Isn't she stunning?
- Yeah.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.080
I mean, are you sure you're
gonna be comfortable in that?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.374
It's not about comfort.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.711
It's about supporting people's potentials.

04:12.711 --> 04:16.380
Starting with Ellen, who designed
this beautiful work of art. I mean...

04:16.380 --> 04:18.966
It is breathtaking.
I mean, obviously, to get to Giorgio's,

04:18.966 --> 04:20.844
I'm gonna have to strap you
on the top of the car.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.596
Okay. Wait, is that what you're wearing?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.556
- This?
- Yeah.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.642
- Yeah.
- Head-to-toe burgundy?

04:26.642 --> 04:28.060
Yeah, it's good, right?

04:28.060 --> 04:31.480
I mean, I figured I should try
and get my money's worth in wine,

04:31.480 --> 04:33.941
and that would lead
to inevitable spillages,

04:33.941 --> 04:35.692
so I just wanted
to make sure I was wearing

04:35.692 --> 04:37.945
something that best hid the stains.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.031
- Dusty. I'll handle this, Cass.
- Thank you.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.617
Tonight isn't about
"getting your money's worth."

04:43.617 --> 04:47.204
Tonight is about raising money
for a cause.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.831
And, in fact, we're hoping people
will give a lot more

04:49.831 --> 04:51.333
than just the $100 ticket price.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.711
You are?
I thought my donation was the dress.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.588
You're so funny, Ellen.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.174
Speaking of which, could you remind me
where the money is going again?

04:59.842 --> 05:01.176
The Potential Fund.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.220
Hello? Is this thing on?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.888
Yeah, that's where the confusion is.

05:04.888 --> 05:08.058
Why is it a potential fund?
Why is it not just a real fund?

05:08.058 --> 05:09.560
It is a real fund.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.395
We just call it the "Potential Fund"

05:11.395 --> 05:12.980
because we're
supporting people's potential.

05:12.980 --> 05:13.939
Is that not clear?

05:13.939 --> 05:15.816
- I actually think that's very clear.
- I don't know.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.485
Listen.
This is really important to me, okay?

05:18.485 --> 05:21.321
Now, I know you have your issues
with the MORPHO, okay,

05:21.321 --> 05:25.409
- but can you do this to just support me?
- Yeah, no, of course.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.535
- Yeah?
- Of course.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.662
I mean, unless you'd rather
be hitting the punching bag

05:28.662 --> 05:30.497
and doing whiskey shots back
at Beau's garage.

05:30.497 --> 05:34.293
No, I would-- No, I wanna be here,
supporting you, 100%.

05:34.293 --> 05:36.044
100%. I love that.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.254
At least.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.090
Yeah, no, you're right. I should change.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.843
I should-- Do you know if I've got
any fresh ironing done?

05:44.094 --> 05:46.722
No. Doesn't matter.
Gonna be a great night.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.359
Hey.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.489
Hey. Bada boom, bada bing!

06:04.990 --> 06:08.243
Look at this beautiful
bella donna in blue.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.746
Oh, stop it. Thank you.

06:12.247 --> 06:16.126
Sorry, Dusty, to steal your thunder,
opening the door for our princess here.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.462
Just seemed like you
were frozen stock-still.

06:18.462 --> 06:21.006
Maybe you didn't notice I was actually
driving the car at the time.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.926
Actually, I did notice,
and you can't park here, brother.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.928
We're doing valet-only tonight.

06:25.928 --> 06:29.306
Hey. Will you take my friend's car
and put him in the VIP section

06:29.306 --> 06:30.849
at the end of the lot, please? Thank you.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.393
The end of the lot? There's a bunch
of empty spots right there, buddy.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.521
- Hey, listen, Dust, come here real quick.
- Yep.

06:35.521 --> 06:36.813
- Come here real quick.
- Just one sec.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.817
- Hey, listen, if you wanna do me a favor...
- Yes!

06:40.817 --> 06:43.946
- Not really.
- ...I need someone to get some ice.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.075
I mean, I would, but you just sent my car
the whole way over there.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.327
Dusty, please.
We need to work together, okay?

06:50.327 --> 06:52.371
I think we need to do everything
that we humanly can

06:52.371 --> 06:54.831
to make tonight a success for Cass.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.627
So, what do you say? Can you be my Iceman?

07:03.382 --> 07:04.716
"Ice" course I can.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.637
I was going for a pun
with "ice" and "of course,"

07:08.637 --> 07:11.139
- but I don't know if it really made sense.
- Hey, Gum. Gum!

07:11.139 --> 07:13.350
Hey, go with D to get some ice.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.977
You guys can take Gum's van.
It's right here.

07:15.561 --> 07:16.854
Amongst the empty spots.

07:17.479 --> 07:21.275
- Gum, it's a gala, dude. A gala.
- Sorry. Yeah.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.736
What's the story there, Xander?
Why's he keep calling you "Gum"?

07:24.736 --> 07:26.989
- It's my MORPHO potential.
- Really?

07:28.240 --> 07:30.534
Must be a glitch in the system
or something.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.786
I'm sure you're meant
for better things than "Gum."

07:33.537 --> 07:35.706
I'm 23, and I work at Giorgio's.

07:35.706 --> 07:38.208
I don't know what "Gum" means,
but it can't be too far off.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.131
I'm Xander, by the way.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.757
I realize that.

07:46.717 --> 07:50.095
You were in my European History class.
And I just called you Xander.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.890
Sick. I didn't think you'd remember me.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.184
Yeah, of course I remember you.

07:55.184 --> 07:58.020
You used to always say
that I was the best teacher.

07:58.020 --> 08:01.356
Yeah. I think I said "favorite" teacher.

08:02.274 --> 08:05.110
- Which means the best. Right?
- Yeah.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.906
I don't think I learned a lot,
but you were super chill.

08:09.448 --> 08:12.951
Yeah, we watched so many movies,
and all your tests were multiple-choice.

08:12.951 --> 08:16.538
You know what? It's not really the method
that matters as much as the results.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.664
Look at you.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.543
Working hard at Giorgio's.
Saving up. And this is part-time?

08:22.044 --> 08:24.463
Yeah. My full-time gig's music.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.007
Cool. Are you any good?

08:28.800 --> 08:29.801
You tell me.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.434
Yeah, this is all me.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.562
- That's a person?
- Yeah!

08:45.359 --> 08:48.779
Giorgio. Oh, my goodness.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.864
This is quite the transformation.

08:50.864 --> 08:54.743
I feel like I'm in some
beautiful piazza or something.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.246
Right? Like mi nonna's Italy.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.414
I even shut down the arcade for you.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.543
No. Tha--

09:03.752 --> 09:06.839
That's a real, live violin!

09:06.839 --> 09:08.465
Hi, sweetie.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.885
When I lived in Italy,

09:11.885 --> 09:14.137
it always felt like
there was some violin--

09:14.137 --> 09:16.932
Playing in a square. I remember.

09:17.516 --> 09:23.063
Now, okay, here we go, Cassie.
The pièce de résistance.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.525
I remember you said that you ate gelato
every day when you were in Italy, right?

09:26.525 --> 09:30.195
I think it was--
stracciatella was your favorite, right?

09:30.195 --> 09:31.238
Yes.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.700
Giorgio. Giorgio!

09:35.576 --> 09:37.744
You have really been listening to me, huh?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.747
How could I not, Cass?

09:40.747 --> 09:43.959
Is this a family recipe, or...

09:43.959 --> 09:46.587
Nah, we didn't have any
of this growing up.

09:46.587 --> 09:50.215
My family's Puerto Rican,
but my stepdad, Rocco Giorgio,

09:50.215 --> 09:51.758
he used to love it.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.469
Wait, you took your stepdad's name?

09:54.469 --> 09:58.557
Yeah, just his last name.
I never really knew my real dad, so...

09:58.557 --> 10:00.017
Neither did I.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.643
You never knew my real dad?

10:01.643 --> 10:04.229
- No, I didn't know my dad.
- Your dad!

10:04.229 --> 10:06.398
Yeah, that makes sense.

10:06.398 --> 10:10.194
I was just-- I'm sorry.
That's bullshit, right?

10:10.194 --> 10:11.445
Like...

10:11.445 --> 10:13.655
You know, like, who would abandon a baby?

10:14.573 --> 10:16.950
Which is why I'm so grateful
to my stepdad, Rocco,

10:16.950 --> 10:19.411
because he's the one that raised me.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.122
Maybe that's why they're called
"stepdads," right?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.208
'Cause it's the good ones that step up.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.587
Nothing ever made Rocco more proud
than seeing me stop a puck or--

10:29.463 --> 10:31.882
or eat, like,
a big bowl of pasta e fagioli.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.091
He would be like...

10:34.384 --> 10:35.385
It's...

10:38.931 --> 10:41.808
Anyway. Yeah.
Enough of this Dr. Phil cazzata.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.936
The guests are arriving.

10:43.936 --> 10:48.148
Hey, how about we make tonight
a night to remember?

10:48.732 --> 10:49.733
All right?

10:53.737 --> 10:55.739
- Hey.
- Hey, Mr. Hubbard.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.491
- And Xander.
- What up, dude?

10:57.491 --> 10:59.076
We need some ice.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.954
Sorry, Trina bought us out earlier.

11:01.954 --> 11:04.248
I guess they needed more
for Giorgio's fundraiser thing.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.582
No, that's not possible,

11:05.582 --> 11:08.126
'cause Giorgio literally
just sent us here to get the ice.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.046
This is gonna sound like some
insane conspiracy theory,

11:11.046 --> 11:14.800
but do you think we were just sent here
so Giorgio could mack on your wife?

11:14.800 --> 11:15.968
No!

11:17.803 --> 11:21.723
Giorgio can mack
on Cass all the livelong day.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.142
Cass would never mack him back.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.145
I mean, not when she's got
a "Teacher/Whistler" at home, right?

11:27.145 --> 11:28.438
I wouldn't think so.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.023
They did look good together, didn't they?

11:30.023 --> 11:33.068
And he's always been obsessed with her.
I think she kind of likes it.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.612
And I am discovering,
with recent evidence,

11:35.612 --> 11:38.323
that I may not even be
a successful teacher. So...

11:42.119 --> 11:43.871
Quick Q, boys.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.623
Do you ever get that feeling
that's there's, like,

11:46.623 --> 11:49.084
a big heavy foot on your chest?

11:49.084 --> 11:53.046
I think that's just anxiety, Mr. Hubbard.
I get that a lot.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.590
Should I go to the doctor?

11:54.590 --> 11:58.552
I'd-- I wouldn't recommend it.
I, personally, just smoke a ton of weed.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.805
Do you want me to call my dealer?

12:04.933 --> 12:06.351
Right. Cool. I'm calling my dealer.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.651
Hi. It's your dealer.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.531
Thank you so much for coming.

12:20.032 --> 12:22.910
Thank you for coming
to support the Potential Fund.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.369
Hi, Mr. Johnson.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.788
Oh, Father Reuben, thank you.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.709
Everyone looks so dapper and glamorous.

12:30.709 --> 12:31.793
Hello!

12:34.004 --> 12:36.465
Cass. I am so glad I caught you.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.008
I know you've been fluttering around.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.928
I just wanna mention that some people

12:40.928 --> 12:43.263
seem to be a little confused

12:43.263 --> 12:46.433
regarding the purpose of the fundraiser,
and I didn't know what to tell them.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.061
It's posted literally everywhere.

12:49.645 --> 12:52.022
We're raising $10,000
for the Potential Fund

12:52.022 --> 12:55.400
to help one special Deerfield teen
reach their MORPHO potential.

12:56.318 --> 12:59.655
Of course. I see the butterfly now.

13:00.697 --> 13:04.243
We're just waiting for it to be filled up.
And can I just ask a question?

13:04.243 --> 13:05.786
Because people will ask me.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.746
Who's the special teen?

13:07.746 --> 13:10.374
- We don't have a special teen yet...
- Uh-huh.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.751
...because we have to raise the money first.

13:12.751 --> 13:16.171
And you pick the winner?

13:17.840 --> 13:20.092
Who better to pick than Cass, right?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.095
Look at that, a bright young teen,

13:23.095 --> 13:25.472
just oozing with potential.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.475
That's me, a young, oozing teen.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.979
Oh, Cass, I don't think you should
pick your own daughter.

13:31.979 --> 13:35.023
You know how hard I've tried
to avoid nepotism.

13:35.023 --> 13:38.735
Yes, I do, and I'm not going
to pick Trina, okay?

13:38.735 --> 13:43.407
But maybe a friend, like Savannah. Right?

13:43.407 --> 13:45.701
Savannah, she got "French."

13:46.285 --> 13:48.996
Now, come on, wouldn't it be great
if the town supported Savannah

13:48.996 --> 13:50.998
so she can go to France, huh?

13:50.998 --> 13:52.457
I don't wanna go to France.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.881
Okay. So, someone else then.

13:58.881 --> 14:02.301
Tonight is about the youth
of Deerfield. Okay?

14:02.301 --> 14:04.761
It's about encouraging them
to be whatever they wanna be

14:04.761 --> 14:06.346
and to go wherever they wanna go,

14:06.346 --> 14:09.057
without having to worry
about how they're gonna pay for it.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.977
Yeah, unless they wanna go on the gondola,

14:11.977 --> 14:14.104
which is $20 a ride tonight.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.690
But don't worry, no one does, so...

14:16.690 --> 14:18.233
Great. Just great.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.948
Look at you with all that Blood of Christ.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.534
- Hey.
- Also known as wine.

14:29.369 --> 14:33.665
Okay, sorry, it's a bad priest joke,
but it killed at seminary.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.250
- Did it?
- No.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.251
No.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.796
I haven't seen you at the bar.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.634
Find somewhere else to get
extra-generous pours on the sly?

14:44.259 --> 14:47.304
No, I've just been keeping my distance.

14:47.304 --> 14:50.682
I feel like I got a little carried away
after the wedding.

14:51.266 --> 14:54.436
I'm taking a little breather
from drinking.

14:54.436 --> 14:58.190
Totally get that.
Yeah, that sounds really healthy.

14:59.816 --> 15:03.320
Well, you know, I'm just saying,
I enjoyed drinking with you,

15:03.320 --> 15:07.157
so if you wanna come by again sometime
for a non-alcoholic drink...

15:07.157 --> 15:09.159
I might just take you up on that.

15:09.910 --> 15:13.830
Scusi! Scusi for interrupting, everyone.

15:13.830 --> 15:18.043
It is my great pleasure to introduce you

15:18.043 --> 15:21.171
to the woman behind the Potential Fund,

15:22.005 --> 15:28.220
Cassandra Hubbard!

15:44.945 --> 15:46.405
- Thank you, Giorgio.
- Of course.

15:49.408 --> 15:51.243
"MORPHO."

15:51.743 --> 15:57.291
There's a word that most of us
hadn't heard up until very recently.

15:57.875 --> 16:01.628
But, without it,
tonight would not be possible.

16:02.254 --> 16:05.799
We would not have the music
by Deirdre Seaford

16:05.799 --> 16:08.468
or the beautiful candles by Cal Yang,

16:08.468 --> 16:13.473
the centerpieces by Biker Barry,
the food by Carl--

16:13.473 --> 16:15.851
And that sexy dress by Ellen!

16:17.728 --> 16:20.772
Seriously,
everything that you see here tonight

16:20.772 --> 16:25.444
has been achieved
by people pursuing their potential.

16:25.444 --> 16:29.740
But what about the next generation?

16:37.664 --> 16:40.626
<i>Oh, yeah, here it comes. Clap!</i>

16:40.626 --> 16:41.710
Clap.

16:43.212 --> 16:46.507
<i>Yeah. Someone once told me
that I didn't have any potential.</i>

16:47.132 --> 16:52.095
<i>Well, news flash.
The joke is officially on them.</i>

16:52.804 --> 16:53.805
Oh, God.

16:53.805 --> 16:58.560
<i>The MORPHO machine
may say that my potential is "superstar,"</i>

16:58.560 --> 17:03.315
<i>but it's my staff
that are the real superstars.</i>

17:03.315 --> 17:06.318
<i>Great night last night, as usual.</i>

17:07.069 --> 17:10.239
- Especially you, Chef Carl.
- Thank you, son.

17:10.239 --> 17:13.450
<i>Hey, Chef Carl,
what's the special tonight?</i>

17:13.450 --> 17:16.453
<i>I believe it's beef steak.</i>

17:16.453 --> 17:18.204
That's Dusty's dad.

17:18.747 --> 17:20.082
Dude was jacked.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.751
I gave his modeling agency a great review.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.586
<i>And I am proud of them.</i>

17:24.586 --> 17:28.464
As they say en Italia,
"Ogni muro è una porta."

17:28.966 --> 17:30.425
<i>"Every wall is a door."</i>

17:30.425 --> 17:35.931
<i>And as Giorgio himself says,
"Doors are meant to be broken."</i>

17:36.515 --> 17:40.143
And as they say in the Bible,
"Pride goes before destruction."

17:40.143 --> 17:42.062
Hey, you wanna talk about pride?

17:42.062 --> 17:45.357
The man has a bust of his own head
next to his bathtub.

17:46.650 --> 17:49.403
- Wait, you've been in his bathroom?
- Yeah.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.822
- We've hooked up a few times.
- Really?

17:52.364 --> 17:54.741
And the last time was super embarrassing.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.828
He was so emotional after Pat
and Farid's wedding.

18:00.163 --> 18:01.331
After the wedding?

18:01.957 --> 18:04.001
- Well, you're not mad, are you?
- Nope.

18:04.585 --> 18:05.586
Of course not.

18:05.586 --> 18:08.172
'Cause you know it was--
it's just sex with Giorgio.

18:08.172 --> 18:12.801
'Cause, you know,
we're not-- 'Cause you're a priest.

18:12.801 --> 18:15.470
I'm very well aware I'm a priest,

18:15.470 --> 18:19.391
I-- And it's no big deal.
I'm just surprised.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.643
<i>Too tired from dreaming all day.</i>

18:21.643 --> 18:24.271
<i>I know a lot of people
are probably wondering</i>

18:24.271 --> 18:27.107
<i>why they should give money
to the Potential Fund at all.</i>

18:27.107 --> 18:29.610
<i>Like, "Hey, I've got my own problems, man.</i>

18:29.610 --> 18:31.028
<i>You want me to give some cash</i>

18:31.028 --> 18:33.447
<i>to some kid who wants
to be a meteorologist?"</i>

18:33.447 --> 18:34.865
<i>Well, guess what.</i>

18:34.865 --> 18:39.203
<i>One day, that kid could grow up
to be a man who could stop a meteor</i>

18:39.203 --> 18:42.206
<i>from hitting Earth
and destroying all the humans.</i>

18:42.206 --> 18:46.835
<i>And then, wow, that $10,000 you gave
doesn't seem to be a bad deal after all.</i>

18:48.128 --> 18:52.883
<i>At the end of the day,
I just want every living child to achieve...</i>

18:56.136 --> 18:57.554
<i>like me.</i>

19:00.432 --> 19:03.477
I thought that would be more
about the fund, about the kids.

19:03.477 --> 19:07.314
No, it is. Just wait.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.942
Wait till we get
all the donation envelopes.

19:09.942 --> 19:12.486
They're gonna be
stuffed to the brim, I know it.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.571
Yeah, I don't know.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.742
Where is Dusty?
How long does it take to get ice?

19:32.339 --> 19:35.592
I'm probably breaking
a million school rules right now,

19:35.592 --> 19:39.429
but that is some seriously dank nug.

19:40.389 --> 19:43.267
I don't know if you still call it
"dank nug," if that's even still the term.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.560
But whatever.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.396
Jacob, if this sticky green skunk
is helping with your panic attacks,

19:47.396 --> 19:51.567
I say fly high, you silly old goose.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.238
I mean, I still have anxiety.

19:56.238 --> 19:59.283
It just sort of helps block
some of it out, you know?

20:00.659 --> 20:01.994
What do you get anxious about?

20:01.994 --> 20:05.122
I mean, I'm down to get real, if you want.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.417
I don't know.

20:10.961 --> 20:12.838
Well, I was sort of seeing this girl.

20:13.422 --> 20:14.798
Boom Shack-A-Lak!

20:19.136 --> 20:22.222
Yeah. It was kind of a secret,

20:22.222 --> 20:25.309
but we decided to end it
'cause things got really complicated.

20:25.309 --> 20:27.519
Everything's fucking complicated,
isn't it?

20:28.103 --> 20:29.646
The whole world's complicated.

20:31.106 --> 20:34.818
But if you can find someone
that you wanna be with, it's a good start.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.656
It feels like Cass just doesn't
want me around these days.

20:39.656 --> 20:43.243
Like she's outgrown me or something.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.745
I'm sure that's not true.

20:44.745 --> 20:47.539
It's like she's got
all of these new secret compartments

20:47.539 --> 20:48.999
that she's just starting to open,

20:48.999 --> 20:51.168
and I don't have any secret
compartments, Jacob.

20:54.463 --> 20:55.464
Maybe I do.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.258
And I'm just afraid to open them

20:58.258 --> 21:02.012
because of what will get broken
in the process.

21:02.012 --> 21:05.891
But if I don't open them,
maybe I'll lose Cass.

21:06.975 --> 21:10.062
She got me this theremin for my birthday.

21:10.062 --> 21:12.814
Like, this weird-ass musical instrument.

21:14.900 --> 21:18.153
And it was like she was trying
to send me a message.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.155
- Did you ask why she gave it to you?
- Yeah.

21:20.155 --> 21:22.950
She thought it would be good
for me to try something new.

21:23.909 --> 21:26.328
Then maybe she thought it'd be good
for you to try something new.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.415
Is it hard to learn or something?

21:31.625 --> 21:33.460
I don't know. I've barely tried it.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.003
Marriage sounds rough, man,

21:35.003 --> 21:36.922
especially if she's making you
do things all the time.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.715
Yeah. You know what?
This is the first thing

21:38.715 --> 21:40.425
that I can think of
that's she's asked me to do,

21:40.425 --> 21:42.427
and it wasn't even for her.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.096
It was, like, a present for me,

21:44.096 --> 21:47.266
along with 39 other presents
that she thought I'd like.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.896
And I barely even tried it.

22:06.577 --> 22:08.996
- Okay, Mom, don't freak out...
- Yeah?

22:08.996 --> 22:12.541
- ...but basically no one is donating.
- I can see that, Trina.

22:13.876 --> 22:15.210
Like, what is wrong with these people?

22:15.210 --> 22:19.131
Well, I think a lot of them
are saving money for their own potentials,

22:19.131 --> 22:22.217
and they maybe thought the ticket
was the donation.

22:24.219 --> 22:25.679
This is all my fault.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.681
Like, what was I thinking?

22:28.307 --> 22:29.808
To put this together so quickly?

22:30.517 --> 22:33.103
- It's just s--
- What?

22:37.524 --> 22:39.526
You can stop smiling, you know.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.905
Excuse me?
I'm just trying to enjoy myself.

22:42.905 --> 22:46.158
You act like you're so perfect,
like you've never failed at anything.

22:46.158 --> 22:49.494
I'm literally saying nothing, Cass.

22:50.746 --> 22:52.539
You were a glorified backup dancer,

22:52.539 --> 22:55.792
whose life's greatest achievement
was playing "Swing Number Three"

22:55.792 --> 22:57.920
in a shitty Broadway musical,
so you can fuck off.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.254
Hey, what's going on?

22:59.254 --> 23:00.964
We gonna fill in this butterfly?

23:00.964 --> 23:03.759
Not even close. It's just a disaster.

23:03.759 --> 23:05.719
What? But Cassie-- What about tonight--

23:05.719 --> 23:07.387
It's over, Giorgio.

23:08.972 --> 23:11.600
No. Look around. No one's-- Look at...

23:18.815 --> 23:20.526
Hello? Hey, what's up--

23:20.526 --> 23:21.985
What's going on, everybody?

23:22.694 --> 23:25.864
So, hey, it looks like we haven't
quite met our goal for tonight.

23:25.864 --> 23:29.493
But I believe in Cass,
and I believe in this cause,

23:29.493 --> 23:34.414
so I will personally pledge $500
of my own money

23:34.414 --> 23:35.958
- to the Potential Fund.
- Nice.

23:35.958 --> 23:38.502
Now, who's willing
to join me in making a pledge?

23:39.711 --> 23:42.923
Come on. Who's willing?

23:43.924 --> 23:46.593
- Come on.
- I'll give you $100.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.178
Okay, Beau!

23:48.178 --> 23:49.930
For that signed Rangers jersey.

23:51.473 --> 23:53.058
Okay, well, that's not for sale.

23:53.058 --> 23:55.602
Come on, man.
The frame itself is worth double that.

23:55.602 --> 23:56.979
One-fifty.

24:03.569 --> 24:05.737
Sold to the bald man.

24:05.737 --> 24:11.201
A one-of-a-kind game-worn jersey for $150.

24:11.201 --> 24:13.287
Fifty bucks
for all of the pictures of you.

24:14.246 --> 24:17.833
Okay. Well, you can't have all of them,
but we can figure something out.

24:17.833 --> 24:18.917
Yes.

24:19.918 --> 24:22.296
Two hundred bucks for the wine fridge
in your kitchen.

24:22.296 --> 24:25.757
My kitchen at home? No, $300, no less.

24:25.757 --> 24:27.968
- Sold for 200.
- What?

24:27.968 --> 24:29.595
Okay. Yes.

24:29.595 --> 24:31.847
Yes, this is going so well.

24:31.847 --> 24:35.100
What else do y'all wanna g--
I got so much baseball shit in here.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.936
Who else? Who else got something?

24:37.936 --> 24:40.689
You could buy that chair right there.
I sat in it.

24:41.690 --> 24:44.693
Boy! Yeah. Thank you so much for coming.

24:47.362 --> 24:48.530
Nice choice, Izzy.

24:49.072 --> 24:50.532
It wasn't a choice, Walter.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.243
As mayor, I'm obliged to support

24:53.243 --> 24:55.579
whatever bullshit
we were raising money for tonight.

24:56.455 --> 24:59.291
And look at Cass. She's a natural leader.

24:59.291 --> 25:02.002
Maybe she'll follow in your footsteps
and run for office.

25:02.002 --> 25:05.255
Over my dead fucking body.
Follow in my footsteps?

25:05.255 --> 25:08.050
I'm still in my footsteps.
Thank you very much.

25:09.176 --> 25:10.177
Good night.

25:12.346 --> 25:16.475
What's up, Grizzy?
May I interest you in one last ride?

25:17.267 --> 25:20.312
No, thank you, honey.
And why are you the gondolier?

25:22.231 --> 25:25.234
Just fulfilling my potential.

25:26.568 --> 25:29.112
- I thought you got "Potter."
- I did.

25:29.112 --> 25:31.823
I just wanted to mess with Giorgio,
and it was way too easy.

25:32.866 --> 25:34.326
- You made this?
- Yeah.

25:35.035 --> 25:37.746
Jacob had some blanks,
and I used my mom's vinyl cutter.

25:38.539 --> 25:40.666
I think even she forgot I got "Potter."

25:40.666 --> 25:43.669
Yeah, well,
she's having her moment, isn't she?

25:43.669 --> 25:46.463
But good for her if she wants to dress up,

25:46.463 --> 25:51.093
play princess and gallivant
with local bachelors for the night.

25:57.641 --> 26:00.686
Like, I still can't believe
you sold all your stuff.

26:02.521 --> 26:06.275
Like, we could not have
made our goal without you.

26:06.275 --> 26:07.317
Salud.

26:08.277 --> 26:09.611
It was an historic night.

26:10.696 --> 26:13.323
And not just because we had
the first female gondolier

26:13.323 --> 26:14.950
in the history of Giorgio's.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.995
I always said we wouldn't do it here
until they did it in Venice.

26:18.662 --> 26:23.083
I think they did do it in Venice
a while ago actually.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.878
- I don't know. I've never been.
- Me neither.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.755
I would always love to go, though.

26:29.590 --> 26:33.969
When I did a semester in Italy,
I swear, I could've stayed forever.

26:33.969 --> 26:35.596
Why didn't you?

26:37.764 --> 26:40.893
'Cause I guess I felt like I needed
to get back for Dusty, you know?

26:42.561 --> 26:45.063
His mom was sick,
and we wanted to get married

26:45.063 --> 26:48.233
so that she could be there in case she,
you know, didn't make it.

26:48.233 --> 26:50.027
Which she did, which is great.

26:51.028 --> 26:54.031
And then we had Trina. And then--

26:54.031 --> 26:56.241
Have you ever seen the movie Sliding Doors

26:56.241 --> 26:58.035
starring the actress Gwyneth Paltrow?

26:58.035 --> 27:01.538
No. But I get it.

27:03.707 --> 27:05.209
I sometimes wonder what would've happened

27:05.209 --> 27:07.878
if I went through a sliding door
and not been a hockey player.

27:10.255 --> 27:11.965
I never told you this, but...

27:13.634 --> 27:16.678
when I suffered permanent
nerve damage to my catching hand--

27:16.678 --> 27:19.306
- Giorgio, you did tell me this.
- No.

27:19.306 --> 27:22.935
The part I never told you
was that the reason

27:22.935 --> 27:25.312
why I was going so hard
in the gym that night

27:25.312 --> 27:29.066
is because I just heard that you
and Dusty were getting married.

27:30.442 --> 27:33.278
I don't know. I guess I just wanted
to make the pain go away,

27:33.278 --> 27:35.405
only it got worse.

27:40.953 --> 27:43.455
When I got that card
and it said "superstar"...

27:45.582 --> 27:49.586
I was acting like, "Yeah, you know,
that's me, that's who I am."

27:49.586 --> 27:54.216
But the truth is, I haven't been
a superstar for a real long time.

27:56.844 --> 27:58.387
I peaked, man.

28:00.889 --> 28:02.140
I gave up everything.

28:02.140 --> 28:06.270
I gave up being a kid
because I thought I had to go pro, and I...

28:09.106 --> 28:10.732
Then it was all gone.

28:11.900 --> 28:14.069
It was over just like that.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.280
But I would give it up,

28:17.322 --> 28:19.783
just like my glove
and my jerseys and my balls,

28:19.783 --> 28:20.868
my signed balls--

28:20.868 --> 28:24.121
I would give it all up just
for one chance to be with you, Cass.

28:34.339 --> 28:35.215
Hey.

28:37.384 --> 28:38.760
Ready to go home?

28:40.804 --> 28:41.930
Yeah. Yes.

28:44.057 --> 28:45.100
I'm coming, sweetie.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.394
- Wait, let me help you ashore.
- No, Giorgio.

28:49.188 --> 28:50.230
Grazie.

29:13.712 --> 29:17.049
Hey. How did it all go?

29:17.925 --> 29:19.092
You never came back.

29:20.469 --> 29:23.430
You went to get ice,
and you just bailed on me.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.729
I'm sorry.

29:32.564 --> 29:35.943
It's fine. I'm not even mad.

29:36.777 --> 29:38.820
I just-- I really needed you there.

29:58.674 --> 30:01.218
<i>Hey, Cass. I know that we
didn't get to finish our conversation...</i>

30:01.218 --> 30:03.887
- Giorgio, you can just stop now.
- ...but I just wanted to say--

30:03.887 --> 30:08.976
- Okay, but, Cass you have to know that--
- Giorgio. Just stop.

30:08.976 --> 30:10.143
No more.
