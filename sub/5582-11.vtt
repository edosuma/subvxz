00:19.087 --> 00:20.154
* What you want, boy?

00:20.188 --> 00:22.190
* All I want for Christmas

00:22.223 --> 00:23.657
* Is to get it crunk

00:23.691 --> 00:25.526
* All I want

is to get it crunk *

00:39.773 --> 00:41.275
* Get it, get it crunk

00:41.309 --> 00:43.444
* All I want for Christmas

00:43.477 --> 00:44.778
* 24s or better, y'all

00:44.812 --> 00:46.380
* A T-Mobile Sidekick

00:46.414 --> 00:48.216
* My own Gucci sweater, dawg

00:48.249 --> 00:51.119
* And I want some soldieries,
a mouth full of tooth *

00:51.152 --> 00:52.520
* And a fresh black T...

01:01.329 --> 01:03.297
Shh.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.666
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:05.699 --> 01:08.302
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:08.336 --> 01:10.704
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:10.738 --> 01:12.140
* How, how, how, how

01:12.173 --> 01:14.275
* Hey, hey

01:20.214 --> 01:21.682
* You gotta come on.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.860
Oh, 9:29--
you're a minute early.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.396
If you're early, you're on time.
If you're on time...

01:35.429 --> 01:37.165
You're late.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.567
Whoever taught you that
must have been very wise.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.734
Yeah, she's a'ight.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.636
So state your purpose.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.339
Um, going to Brandon's
for a little Halo marathon,

01:45.373 --> 01:46.740
sleep over if that's
cool with you?

01:46.774 --> 01:49.243
Well, if it's cool
with his parental units,

01:49.277 --> 01:50.378
it's fine with this one.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.213
MAN:
Yo, Drizz, get off the phone!

01:52.246 --> 01:53.681
Let's go, man!

01:53.714 --> 01:55.416
Who's that?
Uh...

01:55.449 --> 01:57.785
just a friend from school.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.656
Just text me
when you get to Brandon's.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.358
All right, Drizz?

02:04.392 --> 02:06.294
All right. Good night, Doc.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.162
Night, Danny.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.366
Why are we still here?

02:12.400 --> 02:15.403
Look, man, I been meaning
to tell you something.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.338
City champs.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.839
Smash Bros,
remember?

02:18.872 --> 02:20.274
Tell each other anything.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.275
Yeah, a'ight.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.776
That little pencil mustache

02:22.810 --> 02:24.212
you've been growing
since the fifth grade...

02:25.446 --> 02:27.281
...I say we go get a razor,

02:27.315 --> 02:29.517
take care of it before
you embarrass us some more.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.352
Man, shut up.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.620
All right, let's go.

02:35.289 --> 02:38.326
Think, uh, it'd be a good idea
if we went over the rules again

02:38.359 --> 02:40.428
for our newbie here, King.

02:40.461 --> 02:43.464
Um, this is not
my first rodeo, cowboy.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.499
I know how to play
Secret Santa.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.202
Not NCIS New Orleans
style, you don't.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.538
I learned last year,
they take things

02:50.571 --> 02:52.373
very seriously
around here.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.407
Rules are simple.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.409
Keep presents under 20 bucks.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.211
And in accordance
with the Napoleonic Code

02:57.245 --> 02:58.379
in the state of Louisiana,

02:58.412 --> 03:00.981
under no circumstances
are you to tell anyone

03:01.014 --> 03:03.251
who you picked
until after the gift exchange.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.952
Okay.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.520
PRIDE: Just in time, Loretta!

03:06.554 --> 03:08.389
Dwayne,
the place looks great.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.424
You ready
for your grand opening?

03:10.458 --> 03:12.426
I'm ready as soon as they fix
the potholes out front.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.562
Ooh, I feel sorry
for whoever picks me,

03:14.595 --> 03:18.366
because last year,
I got an antique

03:18.399 --> 03:19.700
sternum cutter
from Sebastian.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.801
SEBASTIAN:
Uh-huh.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.636
Hard to top that.

03:22.670 --> 03:23.871
Yeah, it was eBay, you know?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.273
All right, Sonja, here you go.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.407
All right.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.811
PRIDE:
Party's over.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.347
Home invasion, homicide.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.582
Federal City, Navy housing.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.916
Time to work.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.921
Victim's name is
Shelley Freeman.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.590
They shot her point-blank range,

03:42.623 --> 03:44.425
execution style.

03:46.494 --> 03:49.330
There's no exit wound
to speak of.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.531
Suggests a small
caliber round.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.469
Looks like our perp
mixed business with pleasure.

03:55.503 --> 03:58.672
More likely perps.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.409
So why kill her?

04:01.442 --> 04:03.911
Maybe she saw something
that she shouldn't have.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.045
Christopher,

04:05.078 --> 04:06.380
dust and check
out prints,

04:06.414 --> 04:08.015
and see if we can
find any traces...

04:08.048 --> 04:10.351
Afraid you won't find much.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.020
Secured the scene-- lot's
missing, little left behind.

04:13.053 --> 04:13.921
And you are?

04:13.954 --> 04:15.823
MA-1 Brown. I called it in.

04:15.856 --> 04:19.059
Canvass the neighborhood
for witnesses?

04:19.092 --> 04:20.728
Would have, if any were around.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.863
Everybody's out celebrating
at Festival of Bonfires.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.565
Left the neighborhood
empty.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.868
You know, I used to think
I wanted a fancy spot like this.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.470
Grass is always greener, huh?

04:29.503 --> 04:32.039
SONJA:
Pride.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.274
You got to see this.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.446
Looks like someone melted
their way through the locks

04:38.479 --> 04:40.013
and gained entry.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.782
Get it to Sebastian.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.465
MAN: I went to the officers'
club for a wetting-down.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.767
Buddy was getting promoted.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.103
Should have just stayed home.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.674
Dad, there was nothing
you could have done.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.943
We been married a short time.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.045
She was everything.

05:12.079 --> 05:15.516
Sofia, you said
you took off around 8:00.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.019
See anything out of the ordinary

05:19.052 --> 05:21.355
when you left the house?

05:21.389 --> 05:23.457
No.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.559
She was in the kitchen.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.362
I went to the bonfires.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.999
It's not fair.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.702
Not again.

05:36.604 --> 05:39.607
Her mom passed away
when she was six.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.877
Commander.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.849
Everything right now
suggests that your wife

05:48.882 --> 05:51.051
was the victim
of a botched home invasion.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.086
Yeah.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.591
I oversee a team
of intel specialists

05:57.625 --> 05:59.693
for the Navy's
Information Dominance Corps.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.896
My laptop's gone.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.399
Sensitive files on it?

06:07.501 --> 06:10.170
All right,
if this was about that...

06:10.203 --> 06:12.606
Rob the commander's house,

06:12.640 --> 06:14.775
make off with a computer
full of sensitive material.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.910
Looks like more than
a home invasion gone wrong.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.479
Could be espionage.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.552
What do you
got, Sebastian?

06:24.585 --> 06:26.487
I got the Freemans'
front door lock.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.489
Uh, I can tell you
what turned it into

06:28.522 --> 06:30.524
a Salvador Dali sculpture.
It was acid.

06:30.558 --> 06:31.992
Uh, I figure out
the particular formula,

06:32.025 --> 06:34.528
I might be able to trace it back
to the manufacturer.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.930
I'm actually really close
to cracking it.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.567
Check out this algorithm I made.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.934
Oh. That's... no,
that's the wrong 'rithm.

06:40.968 --> 06:41.802
One second.
SONJA: Ooh!

06:41.835 --> 06:43.804
Sebastian.
No, that's... I can explain.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.139
Okay?
You naughty little elf.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.875
I'm not being naughty;
I'm just using

06:47.908 --> 06:49.877
a scientific method
to figure out my Secret Santa,

06:49.910 --> 06:51.812
so that I can then
send them e-mails

06:51.845 --> 06:53.113
anonymously with
great gift ideas.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.116
Sorry to interrupt
your forecast Sebastian,

06:56.149 --> 06:58.486
but Patton Claus
comes bearing gifts.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.654
The Navy installed
location software

07:00.688 --> 07:02.122
into the commander's computer.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.892
I managed to remotely access
his laptop,

07:04.925 --> 07:06.760
get his GPS signals, and...

07:08.095 --> 07:09.563
Looks like it's on the move.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.598
That's kind of like
that app you can get

07:10.631 --> 07:12.633
where NORAD tracks Santa's
sleigh on Christmas Eve.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.067
You ever get that?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.603
He's headed down St. Claude Ave.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.938
Brody, with me.
Patton, alert NOPD.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.873
Have them meet us en route.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.747
PRIDE: We have eyes on suspect,
eastbound on St. Claude.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.582
Approaching Center Street.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.823
Show me your hands!
Keep your hands up!

07:38.125 --> 07:40.628
Hey, I didn't
do anything, man.

07:40.661 --> 07:41.562
I didn't do anything!

07:41.595 --> 07:43.597
Come on!

07:45.032 --> 07:47.601
Got the goods.
Get him up.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.602
OFFICER:
Come on, on your feet.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.807
Danny?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.792
What the hell is
going on, Danny?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.260
You got stolen goods

08:13.293 --> 08:16.764
in the back of your car
connected to a murder.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.065
I don't know what to say.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.900
Start with the truth.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.770
W-Well, the truth is,
I don't know how it got there.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.071
Come on.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.773
Pride, I'm telling you.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.241
I-I was driving around friends
all night.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.043
I'm the only one with a car.
Okay.

08:30.077 --> 08:33.180
So someone else left
the backpack in your car. Who?

08:33.213 --> 08:34.782
I don't know.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.817
I don't.

08:39.587 --> 08:42.189
Everyone who you were
driving around last night--

08:42.222 --> 08:44.224
gonna need names
and phone numbers.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.894
Then can I go?

08:46.927 --> 08:49.096
Protocol says
I got to take you in.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.899
Just till we
sort things out.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.133
And he's doing all right?

08:53.166 --> 08:55.168
Considering the
circumstances.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.304
And he doesn't know
who put the backpack in his car?

08:57.337 --> 09:00.240
Gave us a list of all the people
he drove last night.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.209
We're running
down the names.
And the backpack?

09:02.242 --> 09:04.144
Sebastian's got it,
checking for prints.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.280
Dwayne, Danny's no spy.

09:07.314 --> 09:10.884
Case is going back to a
robbery-homicide investigation.

09:14.187 --> 09:17.825
Dwayne, I know Danny's been
in a bit of trouble, but...

09:17.858 --> 09:19.860
I know. He's a good kid.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.597
Where the hell are my damn keys?

09:23.631 --> 09:25.265
Hey, hey, hey.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.867
Just take a breath.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.201
Let me look.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.940
Here we go.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.241
I'll drive.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.911
Tell Dad Merry Christmas,
I love him.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.212
I am... I'm hanging up now, Mom.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.313
LASALLE:
Look alive!

09:40.347 --> 09:41.749
Visitor on deck.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.951
Meredith Brody,
meet Dinah Clark, NOPD.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.185
Old friend of me and Pride.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.220
Friend's a strong word,
Christopher.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.323
I always liked King.
I tolerated him.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.092
I know what you mean.
Nice meeting you.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.961
You, too. I've been
working with them

09:53.994 --> 09:56.263
on joint investigations ever
since they opened the office.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.699
I got a few robberies, and
I think there's something

09:58.732 --> 10:00.934
that might be connected
to yours: melted locks.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.704
Same acid that was used to
break into the Freemans'

10:03.737 --> 10:05.338
was used in three
other break-ins.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.308
Except this is the first time
they went and killed somebody.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.242
Well, I sent you the files.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.978
I'll pull that up.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.984
That was taken from
a neighborhood watch

10:17.017 --> 10:18.719
surveillance cam
in Fed City.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.287
We are looking for a crew.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.155
Four knuckleheads, altogether.

10:22.189 --> 10:25.959
Wordy Nerdy
worked his ballistics magic,

10:25.993 --> 10:27.928
got a hit on NIBIN.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.263
Killer's gun,
Smith & Wesson .22,

10:30.297 --> 10:32.666
was registered
to Ronnie Doyle,

10:32.700 --> 10:34.134
pawn shop owner.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.303
Discharged it last year
to stop a robbery attempt.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.771
How'd that gun get into
the hands of our killer?

10:37.805 --> 10:39.139
Did Doyle sell it?

10:39.172 --> 10:42.309
Well, he didn't submit
a 4473 to ATF, so...

10:42.342 --> 10:44.344
Hey, girl, I'm Sonja Percy,
by the way.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.846
Clark, NOPD.
Cool.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.347
Let's pay a visit
to that store.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.950
Y'all don't mind if
I tag along, do you?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.418
SONJA:
Sure.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.986
Don't worry about me.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.389
Go ahead. You ladies have fun.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.026
CJ know about all this?

10:59.059 --> 11:00.327
No.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.229
Let's hope he
doesn't have to.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.331
You're gonna be fine.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.399
They, uh,
figure anything out yet?

11:06.433 --> 11:08.335
Last thing I heard, they were
looking at your list of names.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.238
Who was on it?

11:11.271 --> 11:14.474
I know Brandon; he's
not the criminal type.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.710
Wasn't Brandon.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.113
Friends from your
old neighborhood?

11:24.151 --> 11:27.921
You weren't playing video games
with Brandon last night?

11:29.422 --> 11:30.958
I was at a party.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.059
But before you say anything,

11:32.092 --> 11:34.394
I wasn't drinking. I was
the designated driver, so...

11:34.427 --> 11:37.264
So there was alcohol
at the party.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.299
But... I thought I was
doing the right thing.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.301
I thought not drinking
was supposed to keep me

11:41.334 --> 11:43.103
out of trouble.
You lied to me.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.104
Well, I know you don't
like my friends.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.438
Well, I have reason not to.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.907
They're my friends.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.909
You better tell me
what happened last night

11:48.942 --> 11:50.744
and who the hell you were with!

11:52.179 --> 11:53.947
I see how it is.

11:53.981 --> 11:56.316
Once a gangster,
always a gangster, right?

11:59.152 --> 12:02.055
Don't you ever
play that card with me.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.160
I will come back later...

12:07.194 --> 12:09.429
when you stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.373
Thanks.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.809
You Ronnie?

12:21.842 --> 12:23.210
Who's asking?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.411
NOPD.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.478
NCIS.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.883
We're interested
in a Smith & Wesson .22.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.385
No, it was used
in a murder last night.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.822
It's the same one you discharged
in the store here last year.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.456
Uh...

12:36.489 --> 12:37.524
Listen, Ronnie,

12:37.557 --> 12:39.492
you've got a couple of options.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.362
Number one, you think real hard
about who you sold that gun to,

12:42.395 --> 12:43.363
or...

12:43.396 --> 12:45.332
Or I can take you down
to the station right now

12:45.365 --> 12:47.034
and book you
on a felony charge

12:47.067 --> 12:48.368
for illegal sale of a firearm.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.203
Okay.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.372
Uh, let me think.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.174
He was black.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.376
Six feet or so, slender.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.011
Had a sweatshirt on

12:58.045 --> 12:59.412
with a lion's head.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.249
Just like Danny's hoodie.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.988
Sebastian got a hit on
the fingerprint on the backpack.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.957
It's not good.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.992
Danny...

13:14.361 --> 13:17.497
...explain something to me.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.467
You didn't know
the backpack was in your car...

13:22.469 --> 13:24.171
...how are your prints on it?

13:28.375 --> 13:31.211
I don't know.

13:35.048 --> 13:38.151
Maybe you can tell me, then...

13:38.185 --> 13:41.488
why the guy
who purchased the murder weapon

13:41.521 --> 13:45.592
matches your description
and was wearing your hoodie.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.606
NOPD is about to come in here
and press formal charges.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.408
You didn't tell me that.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.576
Just found out
about it myself.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.013
I bought all the time I could.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.984
Now, I know you, son.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.986
I know you got a good heart.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.889
And I believe you had
nothing to do with this,

14:15.923 --> 14:17.857
but there's something
you're not saying.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.431
Come on, Danny.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.465
Hey.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.035
I'm the best chance you got.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.506
If I tell you...

14:33.540 --> 14:34.574
Stop.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.243
Don't say another word.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.444
Loretta?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.279
I'm sorry, Dwayne.

14:39.312 --> 14:43.383
But Danny's not saying another
word until he sees a lawyer.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.166
What are you doing, Loretta?

14:59.199 --> 15:01.401
You get him a lawyer,
I can't talk to him.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.403
I'm trying to help him.
So am I.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.472
He's a young black
man with a record.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.208
He talks,
they will use it against him.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.144
Well, who would you rather have
take his statement? Someone...

15:11.178 --> 15:12.980
That's my son in there!

15:13.013 --> 15:14.647
And he will not say

15:14.681 --> 15:17.617
another word
until he gets a lawyer.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.019
CLARK:
King.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.559
Wish I could say
I was here

15:26.593 --> 15:30.063
to catch up on old times,
but... I got to take him in.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.404
OFFICER:
Let's go.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.476
Doc.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.512
I'm right behind you.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.617
LASALLE:
I been fishing with Danny.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.353
He let a trophy bass go 'cause
he didn't want to see it suffer.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.355
He's no killer.
I'm not saying he is.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.258
I'm saying he may have had
his hands in the burglaries.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.659
He's got grand theft,

15:59.692 --> 16:01.361
possession with intent
to distribute...

16:01.394 --> 16:02.662
PRIDE:
He was 15,

16:02.695 --> 16:04.764
working for
his drug-dealing dad.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.767
Tough upbringing doesn't
make a career criminal.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.469
Now, we got 24 hours

16:09.502 --> 16:11.671
until Danny's brought
before a magistrate.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.673
Let's stay focused
on what we do know.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.608
All right, we're looking for
a crew of four

16:15.642 --> 16:16.776
in these burglaries.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.012
Even if Danny
is one of 'em...

16:19.046 --> 16:20.313
Still three out there.
PRIDE: Find 'em,

16:20.347 --> 16:21.314
we'll get to the truth.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.649
Triple P got some of

16:22.682 --> 16:24.184
his own truth
to drop on y'all.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.019
I dumped Danny's phone records.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.655
You'll never guess who he called
on the day of the break-in.

16:28.688 --> 16:29.589
Residence of

16:29.622 --> 16:32.359
none other than
Master-at-Arms First Class

16:32.392 --> 16:33.493
Daryl Brown.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.128
LASALLE:
So our first responder

16:35.162 --> 16:37.664
had a conversation that day
with our only suspect.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.666
Master-at-Arm
patrols the neighborhood,

16:39.699 --> 16:41.701
knows the coming and going
of the homeowners.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.703
He's the perfect lookout.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.444
Hey.

16:51.478 --> 16:54.047
Brought you a cup of my mother's
famous unpasteurized eggnog.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.648
Of course, there's
still a chance of

16:55.682 --> 16:57.084
bacterial contamination,

16:57.117 --> 16:59.452
but there's enough
rum in there to...

16:59.486 --> 17:00.620
counteract it.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.721
Ooh.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.323
You okay?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.759
I assume you have
something else to share

17:06.793 --> 17:08.628
besides the eggnog.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.235
But you're afraid it might
implicate Danny in some way?

17:15.268 --> 17:16.736
I don't know. You know?

17:16.769 --> 17:18.638
B-But if it does,
then what am I...

17:18.671 --> 17:20.740
Sebastian, the best way
for us to help him now

17:20.773 --> 17:23.643
is to learn everything
about what happened.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.645
So what have you found?

17:25.678 --> 17:27.647
All right, well, I broke
down the chemical makeup

17:27.680 --> 17:30.617
of the acid used on the locks
in all the break-ins.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.319
Uh, barium sulfate,

17:32.352 --> 17:33.620
sulfuric acid
and ammonium.

17:33.653 --> 17:34.887
Etch solution?

17:34.921 --> 17:37.357
Yeah, mainly used by graffiti
artists to tag glass windows,

17:37.390 --> 17:40.360
but also by gang members
to mark their territory.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.295
And melting locks, in this case.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.063
You tell Pride?

17:45.798 --> 17:49.636
Sebastian, forensic evidence
can be used just as often

17:49.669 --> 17:53.106
to exonerate
as it is to incriminate.

17:55.142 --> 17:59.179
Well, at least you have
something you can be doing.

17:59.212 --> 18:03.316
I, on the other hand,
can only hurry up and wait.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.754
Can I give you a hug?

18:08.755 --> 18:11.391
I'd like that.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.567
Look at the log.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.902
5:42 p.m.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.904
I was responding to a noise
complaint on Lafayette.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.773
Can't be in two
places at once.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.441
I wasn't the one
talking to that kid.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.377
Well, the call lasted
over five minutes,

18:30.410 --> 18:31.778
so someone was on the line.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.146
Someone else was here.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.882
My son.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.550
Alonzo.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.785
Would've been home
from school.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.287
Does your son know
Danny Malloy?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.655
I don't know.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.724
Alonzo spent his childhood
with his grandma

18:44.757 --> 18:45.892
while I was at sea.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.927
Tours across the WESTPAC.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.364
Grandma passed, I came home.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.400
Been doing the single
parent thing ever since.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.236
Work nights,
sleep days.

18:56.269 --> 18:59.406
I'm not proud of it.
I'm doing the best I can.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.575
Then I take it you didn't know
where your son was

19:02.609 --> 19:04.444
the night of
Shelly Freeman's murder.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.481
I see what this is.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.483
You're trying
to put this on him?

19:10.517 --> 19:12.819
Look, he's had run-ins
with the law,

19:12.852 --> 19:15.422
but what you're accusing him of,
not my boy.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.689
Listen,

19:16.723 --> 19:18.958
raising a kid on your own
isn't easy.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.561
We're just trying
to make sense of it all.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.364
With your permission,
we'd like to see his room.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.268
*

19:44.784 --> 19:46.319
Brody.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.593
Alonzo's into
graffiti acid.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.362
Same stuff Sebastian said

19:55.395 --> 19:57.230
was used to burn through
those locks.

19:57.264 --> 20:00.367
Where's your son now?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.869
At school.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.871
At least, I think he is.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.874
Copy that. We'll scoop him up
and bring him back to base.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.909
Pride spoke with
the principal.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.911
Apparently, we can find
Alonzo volunteering

20:11.944 --> 20:13.913
at the Navy Charity
Club's gift drive.

20:13.946 --> 20:17.917
Aw. Ain't that sweet?
Criminal with a heart of gold.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.820
Little birdie may have told me
who your Secret Santa is.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.322
So have you thought
any further

20:22.355 --> 20:23.823
about what you're gonna
get boss man?

20:23.856 --> 20:25.892
Matter of fact, I have.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.927
Pulled a couple strings.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.263
Got Pride a complimentary
cooking lesson

20:30.297 --> 20:32.932
with Emeril Lagasse. Bam!

20:32.965 --> 20:35.802
Uh, I don't know that
that's such a great idea.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.904
Lasalle told me
about this incident

20:37.937 --> 20:39.939
at the 2008 gumbo cook-off.

20:39.972 --> 20:40.940
Just saying.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.809
You messing with me?

20:42.842 --> 20:44.477
It's your career.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.779
Damn it.

20:51.784 --> 20:57.557
I am suddenly feeling awkward,
gawky and gangly all over again.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.626
SONJA:
Three o'clock.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.530
Hey. I'm looking for Alonzo.
You seen him around?

21:03.563 --> 21:06.733
Question's: why haven't
I seen you around?

21:06.766 --> 21:07.967
I look like I go here?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.502
NCIS federal agents.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.938
Looking for Alonzo, ma'am?
Yes.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.040
Don't think he's here today.
At least, I haven't seen him.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.809
That is a nice broach, sweetie.
Where'd you get it?

21:16.843 --> 21:19.979
Oh. It's my birthday.
Zo gave it to me as a present.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.981
Isn't it, like, so beautiful?

21:22.014 --> 21:22.882
Breathtaking.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.855
BRODY and SONJA:
I got him!

21:28.888 --> 21:29.689
NCIS! Stop!

21:29.722 --> 21:32.559
(alarm ringing,
students clamoring)

21:59.118 --> 22:01.488
NOPD's got a BOLO out on Alonzo.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.590
What we know about the kid
so far: new to the school,

22:03.623 --> 22:06.125
issues with authority,
trouble making friends.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.495
What do you got there?
Clocked the victim's broach

22:08.528 --> 22:09.862
on a girl from
the NCC club.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.564
Went through the rest
of the students' things.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.633
We found a crap load
of loot taken from

22:13.666 --> 22:14.501
our string of break-ins.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.403
BRODY:
Christmas and birthday presents

22:16.436 --> 22:18.705
gifted from none other
than our fugitive, Alonzo.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.641
So new kid at school
starts robbing homes

22:21.674 --> 22:23.776
to buy himself friends?

22:23.810 --> 22:26.546
Well, Alonzo's rap sheet says
that's not as far-fetched

22:26.579 --> 22:27.980
as you might think.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.149
The kid's got petty theft,

22:30.182 --> 22:31.918
trespassing, tagging.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.753
Basically called juvie
his second home.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.154
Is that where he met Danny?

22:35.187 --> 22:36.989
LASALLE: Go back
further than that.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.526
The two of them grew up
in the same neighborhood,

22:39.559 --> 22:42.061
played on the same baseball team
since they were kids.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.163
SONJA: And seeing how
Danny's been making

22:44.196 --> 22:46.666
an awful lot of calls to
the Brown residence lately,

22:46.699 --> 22:47.667
they're still close.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.735
Looks like Danny's past

22:48.768 --> 22:50.403
is starting to rear
its ugly head.

22:50.437 --> 22:51.671
Not so fast.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.139
Pawn shop owner said

22:53.172 --> 22:56.876
the kid he sold the gun to
was wearing a lion hoodie.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.611
Assumed it was Danny.

22:58.645 --> 23:01.013
But maybe his old pal Alonzo
shares his team spirit,

23:01.047 --> 23:02.549
has the same one.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.816
And it wouldn't be
the first time

23:03.850 --> 23:05.752
an eyewitness
wrongly I.D.'d a perp.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.520
So Alonzo got the gun.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.522
He had the acid
to break through those locks.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.992
And based on the bling we got
from the school, the goods, too.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.628
Looks like we found
our ringleader, but where is he?

23:15.662 --> 23:16.863
We better find out fast.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.531
Y'all coordinate with NOPD.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.099
Look for him and
his accomplices.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.101
Canvass Alonzo's
new and old haunts.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.136
I got a call to make.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.611
He's gonna be charged
with the murder.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.646
Dinah.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.552
I'm asking you as a friend

23:39.586 --> 23:42.622
to hold off taking Danny
before the magistrate.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.457
I'm close on something.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.693
I never met a man better judge
of character than you, King,

23:46.726 --> 23:49.862
but... but I think
you're too close on this one.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.498
Or maybe you are.

23:51.531 --> 23:54.501
Bull Costigan,
Danny's dad.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.569
Memory serves me,
a few years back,

23:56.603 --> 23:58.638
he nearly killed your partner,
right?

24:00.673 --> 24:02.475
Cold-blooded.

24:02.509 --> 24:05.177
Dad like that,
make a monster out of anybody.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.713
Kid's not his father.

24:08.014 --> 24:11.584
And I'd stake my reputation,
everything I got,

24:11.618 --> 24:13.219
that he didn't do this.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.157
What if I can get him
to talk?

24:18.190 --> 24:20.860
If he gives us something,

24:20.893 --> 24:23.830
something solid
we can move on,

24:23.863 --> 24:25.698
I will go back to the D.A.

24:25.732 --> 24:28.568
That's all I'm asking.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.713
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

24:58.831 --> 25:00.800
I spoke to your lawyer, Danny.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.234
He reviewed the charges,

25:02.268 --> 25:06.706
says they're harsh...
but he has a case.

25:06.739 --> 25:09.642
I used to visit my dad in here
when I was a kid.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.545
I remember this

25:12.579 --> 25:16.916
ugly-ass orange jumper
he had on him.

25:16.949 --> 25:21.654
I promised myself
I'd never end up in one.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.190
Now look at me.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.626
Like father like son.

25:26.659 --> 25:27.660
You're nothing like him.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.129
You think you know me?

25:30.162 --> 25:34.166
Hmm? I'm like your...
your little project.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.968
Adopt the street kid,

25:36.002 --> 25:38.738
bring him home, fix him up.

25:40.372 --> 25:44.243
I brought you and CJ
into my home

25:44.276 --> 25:47.747
because I wanted to be
part of your lives.

25:49.749 --> 25:53.653
I can't figure you out, Doc.

25:53.686 --> 25:57.023
One second, you're yelling at me
and treating me like I'm guilty,

25:57.056 --> 25:59.025
and then the next,
you're getting me a lawyer

25:59.058 --> 26:00.292
and you're defending me.

26:02.328 --> 26:05.064
But what really
gets me...

26:05.097 --> 26:08.067
how come you never asked?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.369
Asked you what?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.271
If I did it.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.607
Because I know you didn't.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.811
But...

26:18.845 --> 26:21.247
if you have something
to tell me,

26:21.280 --> 26:23.916
now would be the time.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.794
MAN: Ma'am.
WADE: Thank you.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.766
How's he doing?

26:39.799 --> 26:43.002
Tired, scared,
staying strong.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.837
He's a tough kid.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.338
Ain't that the truth.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.042
We got a potential suspect.

26:50.076 --> 26:53.345
But he's a ghost.

26:53.379 --> 26:56.148
Alonzo Brown.

26:56.182 --> 26:58.284
Childhood friend
of Danny's.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.822
Dwayne, I want
to apologize for earlier.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.824
You don't need to
apologize, Loretta.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.926
No. I...

27:06.959 --> 27:10.229
I just want you to know, it's
not that I didn't trust you.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.431
When you're backed up
to a corner,

27:12.464 --> 27:14.834
you're accused of something
you didn't do,

27:14.867 --> 27:17.837
walls go up.

27:17.870 --> 27:21.207
I'm speaking from experience.

27:23.242 --> 27:26.779
Figured if I came at him
too hard, he'd shut me out.

27:26.813 --> 27:31.017
Yeah, but if you give him
support without question...

27:31.050 --> 27:32.284
He'll talk.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.254
He's ready, Dwayne.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.890
But I need assurances.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.792
I got it.

27:39.826 --> 27:42.795
DANNY:
I wasn't completely

27:42.829 --> 27:46.465
straight with you guys
about who I was with that night.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.335
Zo was in my car,

27:49.368 --> 27:51.971
and I was giving him
a ride to a party.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.807
When we got there,
he gave me his bag

27:54.841 --> 27:56.843
and asked me to put
it on the seat.

27:56.876 --> 28:01.047
I swear, I had no idea
what was in there.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.382
You didn't check it?
Why would I?

28:03.415 --> 28:05.217
My friend.

28:05.251 --> 28:08.387
Me and Zo, we go way back.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.823
Looked out for each other
when no one else would.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.826
Best way to look out
for Alonzo now,

28:13.860 --> 28:15.762
help us find him.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.830
WADE:
Go on, Danny.

28:17.864 --> 28:19.932
It's all right.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.911
There's a spot we used to go to
when we were kids--

28:31.944 --> 28:36.315
our sanctuary, a place
nobody could get to us.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.317
Claiborne and Forstall.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.187
The abandoned church
with the red-patched doors.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.304
NCIS.

28:58.337 --> 29:01.207
Federal agents.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.469
Sofia?

29:30.502 --> 29:33.906
Put down the gun... now.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.507
Easy.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.910
He... he was going to kill me.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.879
He was gonna kill me.

29:50.189 --> 29:51.958
PRIDE:
Chris!

29:51.991 --> 29:54.026
Alonzo?

29:54.060 --> 29:56.929
Alonzo. Hey, man.

29:56.963 --> 29:57.997
Call for help.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.999
I'm on it.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.567
PRIDE: Just keep breathing,
nice and easy.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.202
It's gonna be all right.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.904
We got help
coming to you.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.939
Help's on the way.

30:20.352 --> 30:23.956
Alonzo-- is he...
is he gonna be okay?

30:23.990 --> 30:25.291
Well, he's in surgery now.

30:25.324 --> 30:28.627
They're doing
everything they can.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.562
I... I didn't
mean to hurt him.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.232
: But he came at me,
and we fought over the gun.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.534
And it went off. I swear, I...
Look, okay. Just slow down.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.503
Slow down, take a breath.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.472
Let's start at the top.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.976
Tell me what you were doing
out there today with him.

30:47.379 --> 30:50.316
I couldn't take
the guilt anymore.

30:52.952 --> 30:56.055
I told him to turn himself in,
or I was gonna come clean.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.357
Come clean

30:58.390 --> 31:01.627
About everything.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.467
Burglaries in Federal City.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.404
You were a part of them?

31:15.074 --> 31:18.277
It started out as a dare.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.512
Zo was, like, the new, cool kid

31:20.546 --> 31:24.984
at school, and he challenged
a couple seniors from NCC

31:25.017 --> 31:27.053
to do a break-in
with him.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.088
I went along with it.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.623
The older kids were doing it,
and-and I didn't want to be

31:31.657 --> 31:34.626
a goody-goody,
you know?

31:34.660 --> 31:37.329
And then we got away with it.

31:37.363 --> 31:39.398
You did another
and another,

31:39.431 --> 31:41.333
and it took on
a life of its own.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.436
Dad, we were just being stupid.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.372
Until Shelly was...

31:48.640 --> 31:50.376
I'm so sorry.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.548
You need to tell me everything.

31:59.718 --> 32:02.421
About what happened
at your house that night.

32:02.454 --> 32:05.324
Um... it was Zo's idea.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.429
I didn't want to do it,
but I was scared to say no.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.365
BOY:
And he had

32:13.399 --> 32:15.001
this power over us.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.536
Whatever Zo said, we did.

32:17.569 --> 32:20.206
We got there
around 9:00.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.041
Sofia didn't want
to use her key,

32:22.074 --> 32:24.343
because she was afraid
it could lead back to her.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.378
Zo used the acid to get in.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.314
Her stepmom
shouldn't have been home.

32:28.347 --> 32:31.050
But she was...

32:31.083 --> 32:32.751
and it got out of hand.

32:32.784 --> 32:37.089
She was gonna call the cops,
so Zo tied her up.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.290
We took the stuff

32:38.324 --> 32:40.659
and got out of there, but when
we got back to the church,

32:40.692 --> 32:42.494
Zo started freaking out.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.030
Saying that his mask fell off.

32:45.231 --> 32:46.498
That she saw him.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.434
We tried to stop him,

32:48.467 --> 32:50.002
but he went back.

32:50.036 --> 32:52.004
He killed her.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.193
Sorry.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.561
Come here.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.236
They've dropped all charges.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.505
Still, I sh-shouldn't
have lied to you

33:26.538 --> 33:28.607
about what I was doing
that night.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.709
It was stupid.

33:30.742 --> 33:33.379
You can tell me things.

33:33.412 --> 33:36.148
Thank you, Doc.

33:38.184 --> 33:41.587
What do you say we
just go on home now?

33:45.757 --> 33:48.327
Doc?

33:48.360 --> 33:51.263
Alonzo

33:51.297 --> 33:54.166
Oh, they're still trying to
stop the internal bleeding

33:54.200 --> 33:56.602
from the gunshot wound.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.604
But if he pulls through,

33:58.637 --> 34:00.606
all his friends are all
pointing the finger at him.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.742
Someone's got to take
the fall, right?

34:03.775 --> 34:08.147
Danny, he may be your friend,
but he's involved in this.

34:08.180 --> 34:09.481
Involved maybe, but...

34:09.515 --> 34:11.417
I'm telling you,
he's not the killer.

34:11.450 --> 34:13.319
They have a
time line now.

34:13.352 --> 34:17.489
9:30, Alonzo went
back to the house,

34:17.523 --> 34:20.426
which aligns with the
victim's time of death.

34:20.459 --> 34:23.095
It's not possible.
Why is that?

34:23.129 --> 34:26.198
'Cause Zo was in my car at 9:30
on the way to that party.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.667
Oh, you have anybody who
can corroborate that?
Yeah.

34:28.700 --> 34:31.537
You. What time's
our nightly check

34:31.570 --> 34:34.540
9:30.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.475
ALONZO :
Yo, Drizz, get off the phone!

34:36.508 --> 34:38.110
Let's go, man!

34:39.578 --> 34:41.647
And I heard you talking

34:41.680 --> 34:43.482
to someone who
called you Drizz.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.184
Yes.

34:45.217 --> 34:49.488
If he didn't pull
the trigger, who did?

34:58.230 --> 35:00.766
Sofia...

35:00.799 --> 35:03.369
the fight with Alonzo--

35:03.402 --> 35:06.638
you said, uh...

35:06.672 --> 35:09.875
it was like a
tug-of-war over the gun.

35:09.908 --> 35:13.512
That it went off
up close and personal.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.917
If it had...

35:18.950 --> 35:25.624
then we should have found
gunshot residue on him...

35:28.694 --> 35:30.696
...but we didn't.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.765
Well, I... I don't know.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.668
It all happened so fast.
I don't exact...

35:36.702 --> 35:38.704
What the hell is this about?
She's been through...

35:38.737 --> 35:40.306
A lot. I know, I know.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.540
Given the circumstances,

35:41.573 --> 35:44.776
I can understand
how Sofia might...

35:44.810 --> 35:46.812
get confused.

35:48.447 --> 35:50.549
All right, Sofia,
let's take it back.

35:50.582 --> 35:53.519
The night of the
break-in, did you ever...

35:56.555 --> 35:58.490
...try to help Shelly?

35:58.524 --> 36:01.360
I... I begged Alonzo
to let her go,

36:01.393 --> 36:02.794
but he wouldn't listen to me.

36:02.828 --> 36:06.532
That'd be hard,
seeing her like that.

36:06.565 --> 36:07.799
It was awful.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.801
I can imagine.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.571
Especially with all
you've been through.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.342
Dad...

36:16.375 --> 36:18.910
falls for Shelly...

36:20.946 --> 36:24.516
and... before you know it,
a couple months go by,

36:24.550 --> 36:27.519
and she's moving in.

36:27.553 --> 36:30.556
Well, yeah, but...

36:30.589 --> 36:31.923
we had figured it out.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.692
Agent Pride,
where is this going?

36:33.725 --> 36:36.328
We were in a really good place.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.898
You mean, after what happened
at Casamento's?

36:39.931 --> 36:43.535
After you chucked a water glass
at Shelly's head?

36:47.606 --> 36:50.776
According to her
former school,

36:50.809 --> 36:55.714
your daughter has a history
of using physical

36:55.747 --> 36:58.350
and verbal threats
to get what she wants.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.988
I know people like you, Sofia.

37:03.021 --> 37:06.825
Kind and sympathetic
on the surface.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.229
But a whole lot of darkness
underneath.

37:16.502 --> 37:19.471
I went back,

37:19.505 --> 37:21.673
and I talked
to Jake and Beth.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.644
You coached them
on what to say.

37:25.677 --> 37:28.046
They weren't afraid of Alonzo.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.848
They were afraid of you.

37:29.881 --> 37:33.018
And you shot Alonzo

37:33.051 --> 37:35.887
'cause you were afraid that if
we found him and brought him in,

37:35.921 --> 37:38.757
he'd come clean,
tell us the truth.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.729
I don't want to talk anymore.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.866
Oh, my God.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.336
She orchestrated the
whole thing, Commander.

37:50.369 --> 37:54.306
She's the one who wanted to go
back to your house and break in.

37:54.340 --> 37:58.810
Made it look like your wife was
the victim of a random crime.

37:58.844 --> 38:02.814
You blamed her for coming
between you and your father,

38:02.848 --> 38:04.483
and you killed her for it.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.287
It was her fault.

38:13.559 --> 38:15.727
I told her to stay away.

38:17.363 --> 38:18.964
She should have listened.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.007
*

38:31.843 --> 38:34.380
* Jingle bells, jingle bells

38:34.413 --> 38:37.015
* Jingle all the way...
Hmm.

38:37.048 --> 38:40.085
That's funny.
* Oh, what fun it is to ride

38:40.118 --> 38:43.689
Hmm.
* In a one-horse open sleigh

38:43.722 --> 38:46.625
* Jingle bells, jingle bells

38:46.658 --> 38:49.461
* Jingle all the way

38:49.495 --> 38:51.029
* Oh, what fun
it is to ride... *

38:51.062 --> 38:52.764
Danny!

38:52.798 --> 38:53.865
You made it!

38:53.899 --> 38:56.635
It's Christmas Eve, man.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.704
Look at you.
You look beautiful.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.372
* Dashing through the snow...

39:00.406 --> 39:02.073
Are you okay?

39:02.107 --> 39:04.576
I am now.

39:04.610 --> 39:05.677
* O'er the fields we go...

39:05.711 --> 39:07.413
SEBASTIAN: Sorry, guys.
Is it cool

39:07.446 --> 39:09.881
It's just, the suspense
is really killing me.

39:12.618 --> 39:14.019
Oh, no way!

39:14.052 --> 39:16.087
The Nano-Drago-Drone!

39:16.121 --> 39:17.956
LASALLE: Whoa.
Hey, CJ?

39:17.989 --> 39:20.626
See if there's a present under
the tree with Loretta's name

39:20.659 --> 39:22.093
on it, would you?

39:24.530 --> 39:25.764
Thank you.

39:25.797 --> 39:28.634
Not ticking. Good!

39:30.902 --> 39:33.905
Oh. I remember this.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.809
You took this when I
first signed the papers.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.445
Day we became a family.

39:39.478 --> 39:40.912
Thank you.

39:40.946 --> 39:43.982
:
Anybody heard from Sonja?

39:44.015 --> 39:45.917
Think she might have
drawn your name, Pride,

39:45.951 --> 39:48.787
because last I spoke with her,
she was feeling the pressure.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.856
Yeah, she may have even
cracked under it.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.925
I admit...

39:53.959 --> 39:55.761
I was feeling the stress,

39:55.794 --> 39:58.597
but then, I realized,

39:58.630 --> 40:02.100
the best gifts
are from the heart.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.903
So this is for you, King.

40:04.936 --> 40:07.873
Oh. This is gonna be good.

40:10.008 --> 40:13.011
* Have yourself

40:13.044 --> 40:18.950
* A merry little Christmas

40:18.984 --> 40:23.789
* Let your heart be light...

40:23.822 --> 40:24.823
Didn't see this coming.

40:24.856 --> 40:25.924
Girl can sing.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.894
* From now on

40:28.927 --> 40:34.199
* Your troubles
will be out of sight *

40:43.975 --> 40:46.244
* Have yourself

40:46.277 --> 40:51.717
* A merry little Christmas

40:51.750 --> 40:57.823
* Make the Yuletide gay

40:57.856 --> 41:01.627
* From now on

41:01.660 --> 41:09.701
* Your troubles
will be miles away... *

41:11.970 --> 41:13.639
* Here we are

41:13.672 --> 41:16.642
* As in olden days

41:16.675 --> 41:24.616
* Happy golden days of yore

41:24.650 --> 41:29.655
* Faithful friends
who are dear to us *

41:29.688 --> 41:33.224
Hmm.
* Gather near to us

41:33.258 --> 41:36.895
* Once more...

41:38.864 --> 41:40.599
Roll Tide.

41:40.632 --> 41:46.572
* Through the years
we all will be together *

41:46.605 --> 41:51.910
* If the fates allow, so...

41:51.943 --> 41:54.613
Laurel, haven't been
late in 20 years.

41:54.646 --> 41:57.783
Not about to start now.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.752
Reveillon at Commander's.

42:00.786 --> 42:03.021
Usual table. Yeah.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.956
See you soon, baby.

42:04.990 --> 42:08.760
* So have yourself

42:08.794 --> 42:12.864
* A merry little Christmas

42:12.898 --> 42:20.038
* So have yourself
a merry little Christmas *

42:20.071 --> 42:22.774
* So have yourself

42:22.808 --> 42:28.246
* A merry little Christmas

42:28.279 --> 42:31.249
* Now.
