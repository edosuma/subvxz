account for a mutation,

us as apex predators,

that a completely discredited
scientist by the name of Robert Oz

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:18.911
was anything other than
certifiably insane?

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:21.079
Ancient history.

Tell me why you failed today.

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:29.925
- Easy, Abe. He tried.
- Stop.

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:32.182
Let him speak.

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:33.891
Tell me why you failed.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.894
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me, genius?

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.852
Maybe the Mother Cell
was contaminated.

01:07:45.937 --> 01:07:48.690
But it's hard,
organic substance.

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:51.359
So that's highly unlikely.

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:53.619
Maybe the...

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:56.702
The cub's gene didn't mutate
naturally like we thought it did,

01:07:56.864 --> 01:08:00.789
but there is no way that it traveled
far enough to be exposed to Reiden,

01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:02.579
so that's a big fat no.

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:10.591
If my hypothesis is sound,

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.676
and none of the elements
were contaminated,

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.762
then I don't know,
maybe it's the...

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.803
- Maybe it was the delivery system.
- The delivery system?

01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:25.898
Yeah. The injection.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.358
The needle.
Maybe the needle was contaminated.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.148
Or...

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:34.410
Or what?

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:40.496
Intramuscular injections
usually disseminate quickly,

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:42.626
but it's possible that...

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:46.292
It's possible it never even
made it out of the dog's flank.

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:50.461
And if it didn't make it out of its flank,
that means it didn't get to the brain.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.970
And maybe that's it.

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:56.341
Maybe we need to
introduce it orally.

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:01.520
Maybe we need to do that
before the cub's pack finds us.
