WEBVTT

00:24.241 --> 00:26.069
YOU WEREN'T PAYING
ATTENTION TO YOUR FEET.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.375
AGAIN.

00:29.159 --> 00:31.031
THANKS FOR THE POINTER,
BUT AS I REMEMBER,

00:31.074 --> 00:32.380
THE FIRST TIME WE MET,

00:32.423 --> 00:33.772
I KINDA KICKED
YOUR ASS.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.775
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

00:36.819 --> 00:37.950
BOTH OF YOU.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.126
YOU'VE BEEN AT IT
FOR HOURS

00:39.169 --> 00:40.431
AND HAVEN'T EVEN
BROKEN A SWEAT.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.694
OOH, UH, MIA,
I'D STILL

00:42.738 --> 00:45.132
REALLY LOVE TO GET
SOME BASELINE DATA ON YOU.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.873
UH, VITALS,
MAYBE A BLOOD PANEL.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.137
IT'D REALLY HELP.
THERE'S

00:50.180 --> 00:51.442
SO MUCH THAT WE

00:51.486 --> 00:53.009
STILL DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE BLOODLINES--

00:53.053 --> 00:54.402
ABOUT WARRIORS OR GUARDIANS

00:54.445 --> 00:55.881
OR WHAT IT MEANS
THAT YOU'RE BOTH.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.709
LOOK, ANOTHER
TIME, OK?

00:57.753 --> 01:00.016
IF I CAN'T ASSESS YOUR
STRENGTHS, YOUR WEAKNESSES,

01:00.060 --> 01:02.062
YOUR VULNERABILITIES--

01:02.105 --> 01:04.107
NICKY. YOU WANNA
WEIGH IN HERE?

01:05.152 --> 01:06.936
WHEN YOU'RE READY,

01:06.979 --> 01:08.807
YOU LET US KNOW.

01:08.851 --> 01:11.549
- OK. I'M--
- I'M GONNA HIT THE SHOWER.

01:17.338 --> 01:18.817
THANKS FOR THE ASSIST.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.906
LAST WEEK,
MIA'S OWN FATHER
SOLD HER OUT TO TAN.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.344
IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME
TO GAIN HER TRUST BACK.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.085
I DON'T WANT
TO PUSH HER.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.434
RIGHT NOW,
I'M FOCUSED ON

01:26.477 --> 01:28.436
TRAINING HER,
KEEPING HER SHARP.

01:28.479 --> 01:29.915
TAN COULD STRIKE
AT ANY MOMENT

01:29.959 --> 01:31.395
AND WE NEED
TO BE READY.

01:31.439 --> 01:34.094
OK, FINE.
I'LL BE WAITING.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.536
I HAVE BEEN
WATCHING YOU.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.278
TRAINING MIA.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.933
YOU HAVE BEEN
HOLDING BACK.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.761
DID YOU NOT SEE
THAT TAKEDOWN?

01:49.805 --> 01:52.938
THAT IS NOT WHAT
I MEANT, MY CHILD.

01:52.982 --> 01:54.418
YOU ARE AFRAID TO BE

01:54.462 --> 01:56.812
A TEACHER TO THIS GIRL,

01:56.855 --> 01:58.205
BUT DEEP DOWN, YOU KNOW

01:58.248 --> 02:00.424
THAT IS WHAT SHE NEEDS.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.470
THE LAST TIME AROUND,

02:02.513 --> 02:04.863
I PUSHED HER
AND I LOST HER.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.735
WE JUST GOT HER BACK.

02:06.778 --> 02:08.345
WHAT GOOD IS
BEING HER TEACHER IF

02:08.389 --> 02:11.087
ALL IT DOES IS
DRIVE HER AWAY AGAIN?

02:11.131 --> 02:13.002
FOR NOW, I'M JUST
TRYING TO BE

02:13.045 --> 02:14.743
HER PARTNER.

02:14.786 --> 02:15.874
HER FRIEND.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.877
IS THAT WHAT MIA NEEDS?

02:21.228 --> 02:22.751
OR WHAT YOU NEED?

02:24.361 --> 02:26.537
WHAT MAKES YOU
COMFORTABLE?

02:29.627 --> 02:32.108
SOONER OR LATER,
YOU WILL NEED

02:32.152 --> 02:33.501
TO MAKE A CHOICE

02:33.544 --> 02:36.460
ABOUT WHO YOU ARE
TO THIS GIRL.

02:36.504 --> 02:39.507
A FRIEND...
OR A SHIFU.

02:42.814 --> 02:45.817
AS REPLICAS GO,
IT SEEMS ADEQUATE,

02:45.861 --> 02:48.733
BUT WILL IT WORK?

02:48.777 --> 02:51.214
BEFORE THE ORIGINAL
WAS DESTROYED,

02:51.258 --> 02:52.563
I EMPLOYED THE INDUSTRY'S

02:52.607 --> 02:55.000
BEST SCANNING
AND IMAGING TOOLS

02:55.044 --> 02:57.002
TO DETERMINE ITS
EXACT DIMENSIONS

02:57.046 --> 03:00.571
AND ITS PRECISE
METALLIC COMPOSITION.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.225
THE WORLD'S
LEADING EXPERTS

03:02.269 --> 03:05.533
WORKED DAY AND NIGHT
TO FABRICATE THIS.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.362
IT'S BEYOND A REPLICA.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.581
IT'S A PERFECT RECREATION--

03:10.625 --> 03:12.496
AND IT WILL
PRODUCE THE EXACT

03:12.540 --> 03:15.630
SAME TONES
AS THE ORIGINAL.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.501
ONCE WE'VE COLLECTED
EVERYTHING ELSE

03:17.545 --> 03:19.764
WE NEED FOR YOUR PLAN,

03:19.808 --> 03:21.897
I ASSURE YOU...

03:21.940 --> 03:23.855
THIS BELL WILL WORK.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.030
WE HAVE CONFIRMED

03:25.074 --> 03:26.945
MIA IS IN
SAN FRANCISCO

03:26.989 --> 03:28.556
WITH HER COUSIN.

03:28.599 --> 03:31.254
WE COULD ELIMINATE
NICKY SHEN

03:31.298 --> 03:34.214
AND GRAB MIA RIGHT NOW.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.825
WE NEED MIA BUT

03:36.868 --> 03:39.262
WE DON'T NEED HER YET.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.699
WE'VE TRIED IT
YOUR WAY, FATHER.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.528
HUNTING HER,
CHASING HER.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.095
SHE ALREADY FEARS YOU.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.228
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

03:48.271 --> 03:49.707
SHE'S NOT ON
THE RUN ANYMORE.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.406
SHE THINKS NICKY SHEN
CAN PROTECT HER.

03:52.449 --> 03:55.670
WE CAN GET TO HER
WHEN WE NEED TO.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.802
WE WILL TRY IT
YOUR WAY, JULIETTE,

03:57.846 --> 04:02.329
BUT IF IT FAILS,
THIS FALLS ON YOU.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.638
STILL AT IT?

04:09.336 --> 04:10.728
HI.

04:10.772 --> 04:13.122
LOOKS LIKE YOU
COULD USE A BREAK.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.384
HMM.

04:20.738 --> 04:23.306
HMM. I KNOW THAT LOOK.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.438
I MAY HAVE A LEAD.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.743
I'M INTRIGUED.

04:28.790 --> 04:31.096
WHATEVER TAN'S UP TO,
IT'S CENTERED AROUND
SAN FRANCISCO,

04:31.140 --> 04:34.056
AND I'VE BEEN DIGGING
BUT IT KEEPS COMING BACK
TO LI JIAMING.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.927
THAT GUARDIAN
YOU SAID WENT MISSING

04:35.971 --> 04:37.102
IN THE EARLY 1900s?

04:37.146 --> 04:38.452
YEAH, HIM.
HE'S BEEN MENTIONED

04:38.495 --> 04:39.714
A FEW TIMES IN THIS OLD

04:39.757 --> 04:41.324
CHINATOWN NEWSPAPER
FROM THAT ERA,

04:41.368 --> 04:43.021
WRITTEN BY SOME GUY
NAME TIN.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.415
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S
JUST FRAGMENTS, BUT

04:45.459 --> 04:47.330
ACCORDING TO THIS
ARTICLE FROM LAST YEAR,

04:47.374 --> 04:49.114
HIS GREAT-GRANDDAUGHTER
CHERI TIN

04:49.158 --> 04:50.290
STILL LIVES IN
THE SAME HOUSE

04:50.333 --> 04:51.508
WHERE THAT PAPER
WAS PUBLISHED.

04:51.552 --> 04:52.814
SHE FOUND A BUNCH
OF OLD BROADSHEETS

04:52.857 --> 04:54.424
IN THE BASEMENT
AND THEN DONATED THEM

04:54.468 --> 04:56.339
TO A LOCAL
HISTORICAL ORGANIZATION.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.775
SHOULD WE GO
TAKE A LOOK?

04:57.819 --> 04:59.690
WE CAN'T, BECAUSE
THEY'RE NOT THERE ANYMORE.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.780
A CERTAIN BILLIONAIRE
ACQUIRED EVERYTHING
THAT SHE DONATED.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.478
RUSSELL TAN. YUP.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.828
WHATEVER'S IN THOSE PAPERS
MATTERED TO HIM.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.439
WE CAN'T GET OUR
HANDS ON THOSE, BUT...

05:09.483 --> 05:11.485
MAYBE CHERI
KNOWS SOMETHING.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.412
HI.
CAN I HELP YOU?

05:25.455 --> 05:28.066
HI, MS. TIN.
I'M NICKY SHEN.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.067
I'M HENRY YAN.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.155
WE'RE HERE ABOUT THE

05:30.199 --> 05:31.940
NEWSPAPERS YOU DONATED.

05:31.983 --> 05:33.333
I DON'T HAVE
THEM ANYMORE.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.377
WE KNOW THEY WERE
ACQUIRED FROM

05:34.421 --> 05:35.683
THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.075
WE WERE HOPING
YOU COULD TELL US

05:37.119 --> 05:38.903
A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT WHAT WAS IN THEM.

05:38.947 --> 05:40.731
HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE
THREATENED ME ENOUGH?

05:41.863 --> 05:43.734
OH, NO.
WE DON'T WORK FOR
RUSSELL TAN.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.606
WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT HE'S UP TO,

05:45.649 --> 05:48.173
WHY HE WANTED YOUR
GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S PAPERS.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.392
PLEASE.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.440
COME IN.

05:58.314 --> 06:00.969
IS THAT HIM?
YES.
MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.188
HE WAS NOT
A POPULAR MAN.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.494
HE STARTED
ONE OF THE FIRST

06:04.538 --> 06:06.888
CHINESE-LANGUAGE
BROADSHEETS IN CHINATOWN.

06:06.931 --> 06:09.717
HE KNEW LI JIAMING--
BECAME OBSESSED WITH

06:09.760 --> 06:11.980
BREAKING THE STORY
OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.634
HE WAS CONVINCED
IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO

06:13.677 --> 06:15.200
WITH JACOB SLOAN.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.680
THE INDUSTRIALIST?

06:16.724 --> 06:19.030
SOME MEN CAME HERE
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO.

06:19.074 --> 06:21.250
AFTER EVERYTHING I DONATED
HAD BEEN BOUGHT

06:21.293 --> 06:22.947
FROM THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.864
TAN'S MEN WANTED IT ALL.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.257
EVERYTHING MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER

06:28.300 --> 06:30.085
EVER WROTE ABOUT LI JIAMING.

06:30.128 --> 06:33.828
THEY WERE...INSISTENT.

06:33.871 --> 06:35.699
I'M SORRY.
I HAD NO CHOICE.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.528
I GAVE THEM EVERYTHING.
EVERY PAPER, EVERY NOTE.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.095
EVEN THE FILM.

06:40.138 --> 06:41.444
THERE WAS FILM?

06:41.488 --> 06:43.620
COULD YOU TELL US
WHAT WAS ON IT?

06:43.664 --> 06:45.448
I CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.190
THEY GOT THE ORIGINAL.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.498
I DIDN'T TELL THEM
I MADE A COPY.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.547
I THINK THAT'S
JACOB SLOAN.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.464
THAT'S THE YUELING BELL.

07:01.508 --> 07:04.467
AND THAT'S THE
- GUARDIAN--
- JIAMING.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.469
SLOAN WANTS LI
TO RING THE BELL.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.949
LOOKS LIKE HE'S
BEING FORCED.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.434
THE BELL--
- IT'S GLOWING.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.873
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THE ROOM IS SHAKING.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.142
THIS FILM WAS
THE LAST PIECE

07:27.185 --> 07:30.014
OF MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S
INVESTIGATION.

07:30.058 --> 07:31.973
MS. TIN,
WHEN WAS THIS SHOT?

07:32.016 --> 07:34.279
ACCORDING TO MY
GREAT-GRANDFATHER,

07:34.323 --> 07:37.195
APRIL 18, 1906.

07:37.239 --> 07:38.849
THAT DATE.
THAT WAS--

07:38.893 --> 07:40.764
THE DAY OF THE
SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.766
DO YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

07:42.810 --> 07:44.072
TAN WANTS TO
USE THE BELL

07:44.115 --> 07:45.552
TO DESTROY THE CITY.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.264
THIS IS JUST
A THEORY, RIGHT?

08:02.307 --> 08:04.571
WE DON'T SERIOUSLY THINK
A ROBBER BARON

08:04.614 --> 08:06.224
SET OFF THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE

08:06.268 --> 08:08.879
WITH AN ENCHANTED BELL,

08:08.923 --> 08:10.620
OR THAT RUSSELL TAN
WILL DO IT AGAIN.

08:10.664 --> 08:13.144
I KNOW YOU SAW SOME
CRAZY STUFF IN CHINA,

08:13.188 --> 08:14.842
BUT THIS IS NUTS.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.800
YOU KNOW I'M
A BELIEVER, BUT

08:16.844 --> 08:17.975
EARTHQUAKES ARE CAUSED
BY THE RELEASE OF

08:18.019 --> 08:20.935
TECTONIC PRESSURE,
NOT MAGIC.

08:20.978 --> 08:24.329
IT COULD'VE BEEN
A COINCIDENCE, BUT
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.723
RUSSELL TAN BELIEVES IT
AND AS LONG AS HE DOES,

08:26.767 --> 08:29.639
MIA'S IN DANGER.
WE ALL ARE.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.162
SO, LET'S ASSUME IT'S REAL.

08:31.206 --> 08:32.729
WHY CAUSE AN EARTHQUAKE?

08:32.773 --> 08:34.557
YEAH. YOU DON'T JUST
DEMOLISH A CITY
FOR NO REASON.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.865
UNLESS YOU'RE GODZILLA.
NO, HE HAD HIS REASONS.

08:37.908 --> 08:40.345
COULD IT BE SOME WEIRD
INSURANCE SCHEME

08:40.389 --> 08:41.608
OR REAL ESTATE GRAB?

08:41.651 --> 08:43.523
WHATEVER IT IS,
WE HAVE TO STOP HIM.

08:43.566 --> 08:44.654
BUT WE DESTROYED
THE BELL.

08:44.698 --> 08:45.873
DOESN'T THAT MEAN
HE'S DONE?

08:45.916 --> 08:47.483
WELL, HE'S STILL
AFTER MIA,

08:47.527 --> 08:48.658
WHICH MEANS THERE
MUST BE SOME KIND OF

08:48.702 --> 08:49.833
PLAN B IN THE WORKS.

08:49.877 --> 08:50.965
WE GOTTA KEEP DIGGING,

08:51.008 --> 08:53.271
FIGURE OUT HIS NEXT MOVE.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.273
WELL, I'M IN.

08:55.317 --> 08:56.492
ME, TOO.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.841
NO.
NO?

08:57.885 --> 08:59.190
YOU ARE GOING TO
CELEBRATE DENNIS'

08:59.234 --> 09:01.366
PROMOTION TONIGHT.
BOTH OF YOU.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.585
AS PLANNED.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.934
WE'RE NOT IN PANIC MODE YET.

09:03.978 --> 09:06.241
WELL, IF YOU'RE SURE...

09:07.677 --> 09:09.374
PARTY IT IS.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.637
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD LUCK.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.030
TELL DENNIS CONGRATS.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.077
OK. I BROUGHT EVAN UP TO
SPEED ON EVERYTHING.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.774
HE'S BEEN KEEPING TABS
ON THE TANS.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.776
MIA, LET'S LOOK INTO
THE 1906 EARTHQUAKE.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.212
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING
IN THE HISTORY BOOKS

09:21.256 --> 09:22.692
ABOUT THE BELL,
AND HENRY, YOU CAN--

09:22.736 --> 09:24.041
I WILL SCOUR
EVERY FRAME

09:24.085 --> 09:25.739
IN CASE THERE'S
SOMETHING WE MISSED.

10:00.774 --> 10:01.818
DO I KNOW YOU?

10:01.862 --> 10:04.125
NO. BUT I KNOW YOU,

10:04.168 --> 10:05.605
JOEL RADDATZ.

10:05.648 --> 10:06.910
YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY.

10:07.824 --> 10:11.175
OK. LET'S GO WITH PHIL.

10:11.219 --> 10:12.263
PHIL DEAN.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.005
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

10:15.049 --> 10:16.746
JUST A CONCERNED CITIZEN.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.096
THAT JOEL RADDATZ--
HE'S GOT QUITE A HISTORY.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.751
SO, TELL ME, PHIL,
DOES YOUR EMPLOYER KNOW

10:21.795 --> 10:23.666
YOU CHANGED YOUR NAME--
FALSIFIED RECORDS--

10:23.710 --> 10:25.233
WHEN YOU APPLIED FOR
THE CHAUFFEUR GIG?

10:26.756 --> 10:29.019
NO? 'CAUSE IF
THE TANS MISSED IT,

10:29.063 --> 10:31.674
YOU MUST'VE REALLY
COVERED YOUR TRACKS.

10:31.718 --> 10:32.719
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

10:32.762 --> 10:35.373
INFORMATION ON YOUR BOSS.

10:35.417 --> 10:36.636
AND IF I SAY NO?

10:36.679 --> 10:38.289
THE TANS PREFER
THEIR DOMESTIC HIRES

10:38.333 --> 10:39.900
TO HAVE CLEAN RECORDS.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.553
AND I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD
THE HORROR STORIES

10:41.597 --> 10:43.773
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO
PEOPLE WHO LIE

10:43.817 --> 10:45.209
TO THAT FAMILY.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.301
THANKS FOR COMING
TO THE COLLECTIVE.

10:50.345 --> 10:51.781
WE APPRECIATE YOUR WORK.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.479
OH, EXCUSE ME.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.438
OH,

10:56.481 --> 10:58.527
THE EXHIBIT
IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.834
YEAH? WE ALL DID THIS.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.792
FRANK, THE COLLECTIVE.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.533
WE REACHED OUT TO
PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY

11:04.576 --> 11:05.969
TO FEATURE THEIR STORIES

11:06.013 --> 11:07.797
AND CONNECT THEM
WITH YOUNGER ARTISTS.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.539
WONDERFUL WAY OF SHOWING
OUR HISTORY, RIGHT?

11:10.582 --> 11:13.237
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE
SO PROUD.

11:13.281 --> 11:15.892
THOUGHTS?
FEEDBACK?

11:15.936 --> 11:17.589
I DID REALIZE
YOU HAVE AN EXHIBIT

11:17.633 --> 11:19.809
FOR BOTH THE ZHAOS
AND THE PENGS.

11:19.853 --> 11:22.812
DID CHINATOWN'S TWO OLDEST
OPERATING GROCERIES

11:22.856 --> 11:24.684
FINALLY SETTLE
THEIR FEUD?

11:24.727 --> 11:27.730
OF COURSE NOT,
BUT IT'LL BE FINE.

11:27.774 --> 11:28.992
HEY, MRS ZHAO.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.385
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THE INSTALLATION?

11:30.428 --> 11:32.169
THE ARTIST DID
A WONDERFUL JOB, DIDN'T THEY?

11:32.213 --> 11:34.737
OURS IS LOVELY.
BUT WHAT ARE THE PENGS

11:34.781 --> 11:35.912
DOING IN THE SHOW?

11:35.956 --> 11:37.000
THERE'S ROOM FOR BOTH.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.698
WE ARE THE OLDEST GROCERY

11:38.741 --> 11:40.264
IN CHINATOWN, NOT THEM.

11:40.308 --> 11:42.310
YOU WILL TAKE
THEIR DISPLAY DOWN,

11:42.353 --> 11:45.008
OR WE'LL PULL OURS
FROM THE SHOW.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.750
MRS. ZHAO...UH...

11:49.447 --> 11:53.016
OH. DON'T SAY
YOU TOLD ME SO.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.148
NEVER.

11:58.195 --> 11:59.240
OH. HEY.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.025
WHAT?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.644
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO
BE AT THE RESTAURANT?

12:12.688 --> 12:14.124
I'M ON MY LUNCH BREAK.

12:14.168 --> 12:15.604
JUST ENOUGH TIME
FOR A VISIT

12:15.647 --> 12:17.127
TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.739
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.784
I NEEDED SOME
URGENT CARE.

12:21.828 --> 12:25.135
I WAS HOPING YOU
COULD SQUEEZE ME IN.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.096
HA! I WOULD LOVE TO, BUT

12:29.139 --> 12:30.793
I GOT A PATIENT
IN 10 MINUTES.

12:32.752 --> 12:37.800
OK. FINE.
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

12:37.844 --> 12:39.454
- UH--
- OH, CAN'T.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.021
GOT DRINKS WITH
DENNIS AND ALTHEA.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.544
CELEBRATING HIS
BIG PROMOTION.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.156
YOU COULD...COME.

12:46.200 --> 12:50.030
HEH. I THOUGHT
WE WANTED TO

12:50.073 --> 12:51.901
STAY IN THE BUBBLE.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.860
YOU KNOW, AT LEAST
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.296
MY PARENTS
DON'T KNOW YET,

12:55.339 --> 12:57.559
BUT THERE'S NO KEEPING IT
FROM ALTHEA.

12:57.602 --> 13:00.954
HMM. A REAL DATE.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.828
SURE.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.441
AH, COME ON.
10 MINUTES.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.973
HEY.

13:23.759 --> 13:26.806
OOH. YOUR ORCS
ARE LOOKING GOOD.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.809
THOSE ARE GOBLINS.
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE?

13:29.852 --> 13:32.594
TOLKIEN DIDN'T REALLY
DRAW A HUGE DISTINCTION,
BUT LATER FANTASY--

13:32.637 --> 13:34.465
POLITE QUESTION.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.339
WHY ARE YOU WORKING
ON YOUR DOLLS?

13:38.382 --> 13:41.777
MINIS.
MINIS. MINIS.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.735
WELL, YOU ONLY
BUST THOSE OUT

13:43.779 --> 13:45.476
WHEN YOU'RE PREPPING
FOR A GAME

13:45.520 --> 13:47.348
OR WHEN YOU'RE DOWN
ABOUT SOMETHING.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.354
I THINK WE SHOULD
CANCEL THE PARTY.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.922
WHAT? WHY?
DID NICKY TELL YOU

13:55.965 --> 13:57.532
ABOUT THE MAGIC EARTHQUAKE?

13:57.575 --> 13:59.360
UH, NO.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.841
UH, WELL, I'M SURE
SHE'S GOT THAT COVERED.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.364
WHY DON'T YOU
WANT TO GO?

14:03.407 --> 14:04.974
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S FLATTERING

14:05.018 --> 14:06.497
MY OLD DEPARTMENT
WANTS TO CELEBRATE

14:06.541 --> 14:08.891
MY PROMOTION, BUT
IT FEELS KIND OF WEIRD.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.806
EVERYONE KNOWS
I ONLY GOT THIS JOB

14:10.850 --> 14:12.112
'CAUSE IT'S
MY DAD'S COMPANY.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.810
- HEH. NEPOTISM--
- YAY.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.334
DENNIS, I DON'T THINK
IT WAS NEPOTISM.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.988
AND EVEN IF IT WAS,
WHO CARES?

14:19.032 --> 14:20.860
YOUR FAMILY MIGHT'VE
GOTTEN YOU THROUGH THE DOOR,

14:20.903 --> 14:22.862
BUT YOU STILL
HAD TO DELIVER.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.167
HEY, YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING YOUR ADORABLE

14:24.211 --> 14:25.734
BUTT OFF FOR YEARS.

14:25.777 --> 14:27.083
I GUESS.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.870
WELL, IF YOU WON'T
DO IT FOR YOU,

14:30.913 --> 14:32.523
WILL YOU DO IT
FOR ME?

14:32.567 --> 14:35.265
COME ON.
I DON'T GET
MANY OPPORTUNITIES

14:35.309 --> 14:38.268
TO CELEBRATE MY
AMAZING, BRILLIANT,

14:38.312 --> 14:41.402
HARDWORKING,
GORGEOUS HUSBAND.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.840
WHEN YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY,

14:44.884 --> 14:46.320
HOW CAN I RESIST?

14:46.363 --> 14:47.408
MM.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.501
FINDING ANYTHING?

14:53.544 --> 14:56.983
NOTHING MAGICAL, BUT
THIS EARTHQUAKE. WOW.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.375
YEAH.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.855
THIS FOOTAGE
IS TOO DEGRADED.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.900
I'M HAVING TROUBLE MAKING OUT

15:00.943 --> 15:02.379
ANY NEW DETAILS ON IT.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.208
HEY, EVAN. HEY.

15:05.252 --> 15:06.949
I GOT A LEAD.
JULIETTE TAN

15:06.993 --> 15:08.037
HAS A BIG MEETING TODAY

15:08.081 --> 15:09.386
WITH A VERY
SHADY DUDE.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.953
HOW'D YOU FIND
THAT OUT?

15:10.997 --> 15:12.999
LET'S JUST SAY
I APPLIED SOME...PRESSURE

15:13.042 --> 15:14.565
ON JULIETTE'S
NEW DRIVER.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.524
SHE'S MEETING WITH A MAN
NAMED GROVER CHARLES.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.743
HE'S A FUGITIVE
SCIENTIST-FOR-HIRE.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.093
HE'S BEEN LINKED
TO DICTATORS,

15:20.136 --> 15:21.921
DRUG KINGPINS,
THE MOB.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.444
HE SETS UP
AND RUNS LABS

15:23.487 --> 15:25.141
FOR ANYTHING FROM
METH TO URANIUM

15:25.185 --> 15:27.013
TO FAKE DIAMONDS.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.753
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
THE MEETING IS ABOUT

15:28.797 --> 15:31.800
BUT GROVER CHARLES
IS BAD NEWS.

15:31.843 --> 15:32.888
WHERE'S THE MEET?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.455
IT'S AT AN OLD WAREHOUSE.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.153
THANK YOU, EVAN.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.981
LOOKS LIKE
IT'S RECON TIME.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.374
OK. LET'S GO.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.768
HEY, EVAN,
COULD I GET YOUR EYES

15:43.812 --> 15:44.987
ON SOMETHING REAL QUICK?

15:47.468 --> 15:48.991
LOOK, MIA,

15:49.035 --> 15:51.472
I DON'T THINK IT'S
- A GOOD IDEA--
- YOU COMING.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.343
PUTTING YOU THAT CLOSE
TO THE TANS IS--

15:53.387 --> 15:55.345
WHAT? YOU'RE
BENCHING ME?

15:55.389 --> 15:56.825
YOU SAID IT'S
JUST RECON.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.522
I KNOW.
YOU'RE NOT LOCKING ME

15:58.566 --> 15:59.610
UP IN A LIBRARY.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.047
I DON'T THINK
IT'S SMART TO--

16:01.090 --> 16:03.527
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.138
I SAW THE ADDRESS.

16:05.181 --> 16:06.661
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU CAN STOP ME.

16:08.445 --> 16:09.969
I'M TRYING TO SEE
WHAT'S ON THIS PAPER

16:10.012 --> 16:12.058
BUT I CAN'T QUITE
MAKE IT OUT.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.624
OH, I HAVE
A FRIEND AT SFPD.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.017
SHE'S A TECH WHIZ.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.453
I BET SHE COULD CLEAN
THAT IMAGE UP FOR YOU.

16:16.497 --> 16:19.108
YEAH?
WE ARE HEADING OUT.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.197
YOU GUYS KEEP DIGGING
ON THE VIDEO.

16:21.241 --> 16:22.198
WE'LL BE FINE.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.678
IT'S JUST RECON.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.247
BE SAFE.

16:44.699 --> 16:47.006
MS. TAN, IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU IN PERSON.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.529
DID YOU BRING
THE SAMPLE?

16:56.189 --> 16:58.234
I'LL HAVE TO RUN
MY OWN TESTS

16:58.278 --> 17:00.193
TO DETERMINE
ITS AUTHENTICITY.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.803
OF COURSE. REPLICATING

17:01.846 --> 17:03.718
A MILLENNIA-OLD
REFINEMENT PROCESS

17:03.761 --> 17:06.112
PROVED COMPLICATED,

17:06.155 --> 17:07.635
BUT I KNOW
YOU'LL BE SATISFIED

17:07.678 --> 17:08.984
WITH THE RESULTS.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.159
I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

17:10.203 --> 17:11.204
I NEED TO MOVE CLOSER.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.035
NICKY. THE CASE.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.255
THAT'S WHAT
SHE CAME FOR.
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.865
IT'S NOT SAFE.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.780
RECON, REMEMBER?

17:22.824 --> 17:24.217
JUST STAY BACK.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.708
WELL. IF YOUR SAMPLE
IS INDEED

17:37.752 --> 17:39.406
TRUE JING JAI JYU SA...

17:39.449 --> 17:41.669
OH, I'M SURE
YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.891
I'LL WIRE YOU THE FUNDS
FOR THE REST.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.763
WHEN YOU DO, WE'LL
ARRANGE FOR DELIVERY,

17:48.806 --> 17:49.851
DIRECT FROM OUR LAB.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.331
GOOD.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.333
WE HAVE THE COMPLETE
AMOUNT YOU REQUESTED.

17:53.376 --> 17:57.250
SHOULD YOU REQUIRE MORE,
WE WILL NEED...

17:58.207 --> 18:00.340
MIA, GET OUT OF THERE.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.736
MIA, WHAT IS HAPPENING?

18:05.780 --> 18:07.347
I APPRECIATE
YOUR WILLINGNESS

18:07.390 --> 18:09.697
TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.654
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.700
THE PLEASURE HAS
BEEN ALL MINE.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.228
ARE YOU
EXPECTING SOMEONE?

18:19.272 --> 18:21.274
NO. GO CHECK IT OUT.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.369
JUST ONE MINUTE.

18:40.771 --> 18:41.816
ALL GOOD?

18:43.252 --> 18:44.645
MORE THAN GOOD.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.410
MIA, WHAT HAPPENED
BACK THERE?

19:10.453 --> 19:12.542
I DON'T KNOW, OK?
I JUST CHOKED.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.457
YOU COULD'VE
BEEN CAUGHT. KILLED.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.633
JULIETTE TAN
WAS RIGHT THERE.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.200
I'M SORRY.
AND WHY DID YOU SNEAK OFF

19:18.244 --> 19:19.462
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

19:19.506 --> 19:21.290
I TOLD YOU TO
STAY BACK. I--

19:21.334 --> 19:22.639
I DON'T TAKE ORDERS.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.685
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP, AND I DID.

19:24.728 --> 19:27.166
I SAW IT.
THE RED GEM.
THAT'S USEFUL.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.515
WE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN
WHAT WAS IN THAT BOX

19:28.558 --> 19:30.299
IF I HADN'T
TAKEN A RISK.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.605
HEY, GUYS.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.739
UH...I GOT
YOUR TEXT,

19:35.783 --> 19:37.393
BUT IF NOW IS NOT
A GOOD TIME, I CAN--

19:37.437 --> 19:39.047
IT'S FINE.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.702
MIA...WHAT'S UP?

19:41.745 --> 19:43.312
UH, WE LEARNED
THAT JULIETTE TAN

19:43.356 --> 19:45.706
IS ABOUT TO COLLECT
SOME MYSTICAL RED ROCKS

19:45.749 --> 19:47.011
CALLED JYU SA.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.448
I THINK THEY'RE AN IMPORTANT
PART OF THE RITUAL.

19:48.491 --> 19:49.666
GROVER CHARLES,
THE SCIENTIST, SAYS

19:49.710 --> 19:51.451
THEY'RE BEING HELD
AT HIS LAB.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.279
IF YOU COULD HELP US FIGURE
OUT WHERE THAT IS, WE CAN--

19:53.322 --> 19:54.845
INTERCEPT THEM BEFORE
THEY GET DELIVERED

19:54.889 --> 19:55.977
TO TAN'S DAUGHTER.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.763
YES, KENNETH,
I UNDERSTAND--

20:01.765 --> 20:03.637
OH, OK!

20:03.680 --> 20:05.943
KENNETH PENG
JUST HUNG UP ON ME.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.771
I CAUGHT MRS. ZHAO
IN THE PARKING LOT.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.643
SHE REFUSED TO
LISTEN TO REASON.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.732
KENNETH IS USUALLY
SO POLITE,

20:11.775 --> 20:13.473
BUT NOW HE'S SAYING
HE'S GONNA PULL OUT

20:13.516 --> 20:14.865
UNLESS THEY DO.

20:14.909 --> 20:17.520
DO YOU REALLY NEED TO
INCLUDE BOTH OF THEM?

20:17.564 --> 20:19.609
IT'S THE PRINCIPLE.
I DID THIS PROJECT

20:19.653 --> 20:21.785
TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.309
SO SILLY. YEAH.

20:23.352 --> 20:24.484
THE PENGS
SHOULD JUST ADMIT

20:24.527 --> 20:26.268
ZHAO WAS HERE FIRST.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.270
WAIT. HOLD ON A MINUTE.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.229
THE PENGS
WERE HERE FIRST.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.882
THEY CAME IN THE 1860s.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.884
THE ZHAOS DIDN'T COME
TO SAN FRANCISCO

20:33.928 --> 20:35.321
UNTIL THE 1870s.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.497
BUT THE ZHAOS HAD
AN ACTUAL STOREFRONT

20:37.540 --> 20:40.239
AND THE PENGS WERE
SELLING IT OUT OF A CART.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.465
WE ARE JUST AS BAD
AS THEY ARE.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.039
LO POR?
MEI-LI? MM?

20:58.082 --> 20:59.301
I HAVE AN IDEA.

21:03.697 --> 21:08.049
SO, THE GEMS--
JYU SA, AKA CINNABAR--
ARE HIGHLY TOXIC.

21:08.092 --> 21:12.227
BUT JULIETTE CALLED THEM
JING JAI JYU SA--
REFINED CINNABAR.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.881
SO, THAT'S WHAT
GROVER WAS DOING FOR HER--

21:13.924 --> 21:16.057
REFINING IT AND
DETOXIFYING IT SOMEHOW.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.712
I THINK I GOT SOMETHING.
I DUG INTO
GROVER'S FINANCIALS.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.670
IT'S A WEB OF
SHELL COMPANIES.

21:20.714 --> 21:23.282
BUT HE HAS ONE
REAL ESTATE HOLDING
IN SALINAS.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.022
AN OLD PROCESSING PLANT.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.720
IT DOESN'T SOUND
VERY PROMISING, BUT

21:26.763 --> 21:28.243
I HACKED INTO
THE LOCAL POWER

21:28.287 --> 21:29.636
AND WATER SUPPLY COMPANIES.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.334
THE PLANT'S USAGE
IS OFF THE CHARTS.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.380
I CAN'T PROMISE IT'S
A CINNABAR LAB, BUT

21:34.423 --> 21:37.339
HE'S DOING SOMETHING
- IN THERE--
- SOMETHING BIG.

21:37.383 --> 21:40.037
OK.
LET'S GO.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.518
CAN YOU GIVE US
ANYTHING ON THE LOCATION?
SECURITY CAMERAS?

21:42.562 --> 21:44.564
ALREADY ON IT.

21:44.607 --> 21:47.218
PRETTY DESOLATE BUT
THAT'S THE STRUCTURE.

21:47.262 --> 21:48.350
I MEAN, IT LOOKS
BIG ENOUGH TO HOUSE

21:48.394 --> 21:50.352
A LAB TO ME. OK.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.441
YOU TWO BE CAREFUL.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.313
YEAH. WE'LL TRY.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.973
YOUR FRIEND WASN'T KIDDING.
THIS IS MUCH CLEARER.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.323
WHAT IS IT?

22:04.366 --> 22:05.889
MUSICAL NOTATION.
SHEET MUSIC.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.543
WELL, A SECTION
OF IT, ANYWAY.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.284
WHY WOULD A BELL
NEED SHEET MUSIC?

22:09.328 --> 22:10.851
DOESN'T IT JUST MAKE
THE SAME SOUND?

22:10.894 --> 22:12.461
MANY OF THESE CAN
PRODUCE DIFFERENT TONES

22:12.505 --> 22:13.810
DEPENDING ON WHERE
THEY'RE STRUCK,

22:13.854 --> 22:16.378
AND TEMPO AND RHYTHM
WOULD BE IMPORTANT.

22:16.422 --> 22:17.727
HUH.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.642
A COUPLE YEARS BACK,
I SAW THIS PANEL

22:19.686 --> 22:20.904
WITH THIS
LOCAL MUSICOLOGIST.

22:20.948 --> 22:24.125
AN EXPERT IN
BIANZHONG, BIANQING--

22:24.168 --> 22:25.779
BELLS OF EASTERN ASIA.

22:25.822 --> 22:28.651
HAN SOMETHING.
BUT IF I CAN

22:28.695 --> 22:30.349
SHOW HIM THIS FRAGMENT,
THEN MAYBE

22:30.392 --> 22:31.915
HE CAN TELL US MORE
ABOUT THE SONG.

22:35.223 --> 22:37.660
GOT IT.
ERIC HAN.

22:45.538 --> 22:49.455
JUST A MINUTE.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.501
CAN I HELP YOU?

22:54.329 --> 22:56.418
WHAT--

22:56.462 --> 22:58.289
HELLO, MR. HAN.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.943
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE
SOMETHING I WANT.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.521
THANK YOU FOR
AGREEING TO COME.

23:12.565 --> 23:14.436
I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO HER.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.829
THERE'S REALLY
NO POINT TO THIS.

23:15.872 --> 23:18.701
AT LEAST WE AGREE
ON SOMETHING.

23:18.745 --> 23:22.966
HEH. LET ME
BE HONEST.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.099
I WANT YOU BOTH
TO BE IN THE SHOW.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.536
I KNOW IT'S FRUSTRATING.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.409
- LILY--
- I AGREE THAT YOUR FAMILY

23:30.452 --> 23:32.106
WAS THE ORIGINAL GROCER
IN CHINATOWN.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.890
THANK YOU.
BUT IT'S CLEAR

23:33.934 --> 23:35.892
TO ME, KENNETH,
THAT YOUR FAMILY

23:35.936 --> 23:37.677
HAS THE MORE
LEGITIMATE CLAIM.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.679
I MEAN,
STOREFRONT OR NOT,

23:39.722 --> 23:41.942
THE PENGS WERE
WORKING HERE FIRST.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.291
THANK YOU.

23:43.334 --> 23:46.729
SEE? MY WIFE AND I
ARGUED THIS.

23:46.773 --> 23:51.081
THIS FEUD BETWEEN
TWO LEGENDARY BUSINESSES,

23:51.125 --> 23:53.693
IT'S BECOMING
OUR STORY--

23:53.736 --> 23:55.956
AND CHINATOWN'S HISTORY.

23:56.957 --> 23:59.089
I'D LIKE TO
TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY.

23:59.133 --> 24:02.571
IT'S ABOUT HOW
I MET THIS GUY.

24:02.615 --> 24:05.748
I'D SEEN HIM
OUTSIDE HIS JOB.

24:05.792 --> 24:08.925
I THOUGHT HE
LOOKED SEXY.

24:08.969 --> 24:11.450
AND THEN WE BUMPED INTO
EACH OTHER AGAIN

24:11.493 --> 24:12.755
AT A FRIEND'S PARTY.

24:12.799 --> 24:15.584
HE WAS SO GREGARIOUS,
SO OUTGOING,

24:15.628 --> 24:17.107
BUT WHEN I WANTED
TO TALK TO HIM,

24:17.151 --> 24:19.327
HE WOULDN'T LOOK UP
FROM HIS DRINK.

24:19.370 --> 24:23.592
HE WAS SO SHY.
AND HE INSULTED MY DRESS.

24:23.636 --> 24:24.767
WHAT?
I SAID

24:24.811 --> 24:26.290
HER DRESS
WAS INTERESTING.

24:26.334 --> 24:29.598
I WALKED HOME
ALONE THAT NIGHT

24:29.642 --> 24:31.948
CONVINCED HE HAD
ZERO INTEREST IN ME.

24:31.992 --> 24:34.777
THAT'S
NOT WHAT HAPPENED

24:34.821 --> 24:36.910
LOOK, I MIGHT'VE
PLAYED IT COOL.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.434
I WAS PICKING
MY MOMENTS.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.131
I TALKED TO HER
AT THE BAR,

24:41.175 --> 24:43.612
TOLD A FEW JOKES,
MADE HER LAUGH,

24:43.656 --> 24:47.486
AND BEFORE SHE LEFT,
I GAVE HER MY NUMBER.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.965
AND I TOLD
OUR FRIENDS

24:49.009 --> 24:51.533
THIS WAS THE WOMAN
I'M GONNA MARRY.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.883
TO THIS DAY,
WE DISAGREE ABOUT

24:53.927 --> 24:55.494
HOW THAT NIGHT WENT,

24:55.537 --> 24:57.626
BUT THAT DISAGREEMENT
HAS BECOME

24:57.670 --> 25:00.542
OUR CHILDREN'S
FAVORITE STORY ABOUT US.

25:02.022 --> 25:04.851
INSTEAD OF FIGHTING
ABOUT WHO'S FIRST,

25:04.894 --> 25:06.940
LET'S OWN IT ALL.

25:06.983 --> 25:11.727
TWO HISTORIC FAMILIES,
ONE LEGENDARY RIVALRY.

25:11.771 --> 25:14.295
WHAT A GREAT STORY!

25:14.338 --> 25:16.515
LET'S TELL IT TOGETHER.

25:27.003 --> 25:29.092
LOOKS LIKE IT'S CLEAR.
LET'S GO.

25:29.136 --> 25:30.572
NO.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.574
WHAT?

25:32.618 --> 25:33.836
I CAN'T GO
IN THERE WITH YOU.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.143
NICKY, THE JYU SA
IS IN THAT LAB.

25:36.186 --> 25:37.710
IF WE DON'T
INTERCEPT IT RIGHT NOW,

25:37.753 --> 25:39.015
THE TANS WILL GET
EVERYTHING THEY WANT.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.451
I KNOW.
BUT YOU NEARLY GOT US

25:40.495 --> 25:41.801
KILLED AT THE WAREHOUSE.

25:42.889 --> 25:45.587
I'M NOT DOING THIS
IF I CAN'T TRUST YOU.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.371
I NEED TO TRUST
THAT YOU'LL DO

25:47.415 --> 25:50.070
WHAT I SAY
WHEN I SAY IT.

25:50.113 --> 25:52.376
IF WE GO IN THERE,
IT'S NOT AS PARTNERS.

25:52.420 --> 25:53.900
I'M CALLING THE SHOTS.

25:55.597 --> 25:59.732
WHAT DO YOU WANT MORE--
TO PUSH BACK ON ME
OR TO STOP TAN?

25:59.775 --> 26:04.301
OK. I'LL FOLLOW
YOUR LEAD.

26:04.345 --> 26:06.260
OK. LET'S GO.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.486
I'VE READ YOUR WORK,
MR. HAN.

26:15.530 --> 26:18.054
FOR AN EXPERT ON
CHINESE BELL MUSIC,

26:18.098 --> 26:20.274
YOU BARELY TOUCH
THE SUBJECT

26:20.317 --> 26:21.884
OF THE SONG
OF YUELING.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.147
JUST ONE SCANT REFERENCE

26:24.191 --> 26:26.976
IN WHICH YOU DISMISS
THE SONG AS APOCRYPHA,

26:27.020 --> 26:29.283
SAYING THAT NO
SHEET MUSIC FOR THE SONG

26:29.326 --> 26:30.632
EVER EXISTED.

26:30.676 --> 26:33.330
IT DOESN'T.
IT'S PURE LEGEND.

26:33.374 --> 26:36.856
I KNOW YOU'RE LYING,
MR. HAN, AND I KNOW

26:36.899 --> 26:39.815
YOU'RE A MEMBER OF
THE WAN ZAI.

26:39.859 --> 26:42.165
YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT
EASY, BUT

26:42.209 --> 26:43.602
YOUR ORGANIZATION IS

26:43.645 --> 26:46.605
NOT QUITE AS SECRET
AS YOU IMAGINE.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.736
MY FATHER'S HAD EYES

26:47.780 --> 26:50.434
ON YOU PEOPLE
FOR YEARS.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.872
I KNOW THE SHEET
MUSIC EXISTS.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.830
I'VE SEEN IT
WITH MY OWN EYES.

26:54.874 --> 26:56.789
HOW?
SAW THE MOVIE.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.791
FATHER HAS
THE ORIGINAL PRINT.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.663
I KNOW IT WAS LOST
RIGHT HERE

27:01.707 --> 27:03.186
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

27:04.840 --> 27:08.409
IF ANYONE HAS IT,
IT'S YOUR LITTLE BROTHERHOOD.

27:08.452 --> 27:09.758
FOUND SOMETHING.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.157
WHY DO YOU EVEN
WANT IT?

27:17.200 --> 27:19.028
IT WON'T DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

27:25.382 --> 27:28.821
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
IS IT REAL?

27:28.864 --> 27:32.302
AH. SO, YOU DO KNOW

27:32.346 --> 27:35.915
THAT THIS SPECIFIC
TONAL AND RHYTHMIC SEQUENCE,

27:35.958 --> 27:37.656
RESONATING THROUGH THIS

27:37.699 --> 27:39.788
METICULOUSLY
FACETED STONE,

27:39.832 --> 27:43.574
CAN PRODUCE
A DEVASTATING EFFECT.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.664
IF IT'S THE REAL THING.

27:48.841 --> 27:50.886
SHALL WE PUT IT
TO THE TEST?

27:50.930 --> 27:52.801
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.890
I'M SORRY, MR. HAN, BUT

27:54.934 --> 27:57.153
THE WAN ZAI
CAN'T HELP YOU NOW.

28:47.769 --> 28:50.859
I'VE AUTHENTICATED THE GEM.

28:50.903 --> 28:53.644
THE MONEY WILL BE
TRANSFERRED IMMEDIATELY.

28:53.688 --> 28:56.038
BRING ME THE REST
OF THE JYU SA.

28:56.082 --> 28:58.214
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT
THIS NEW STAGE OF MY LIFE,

28:58.258 --> 29:01.652
BUT I WILL MISS WORKING
WITH YOU ALL EVERY DAY.

29:01.696 --> 29:02.871
CHEERS.
CHEERS.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.963
HEY.

29:08.921 --> 29:12.968
OK. OK. CUTE.

29:13.012 --> 29:16.580
I APPROVE.
TIME TO TELL MAMA?

29:16.624 --> 29:17.581
OH, GOOD LORD, NO.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.888
YEAH, MAYBE NOT YET.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.369
HEH. WELL,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.156
EVERYTHING OK?

29:27.200 --> 29:28.897
IT'S NICKY.
SHE NEEDS HELP WITH--

29:29.855 --> 29:31.900
WORK.

29:31.944 --> 29:33.119
SHE NEEDS HELP WITH HER JOB.

29:33.162 --> 29:35.251
YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT.

29:35.295 --> 29:36.383
EXCUSE ME.

29:39.429 --> 29:42.432
I THOUGHT
YOUR SISTER WORKED AT
HARMONY DUMPLINGS.

29:42.476 --> 29:43.825
YOU KNOW, COME TO THINK,

29:43.869 --> 29:45.392
I'VE ONLY SEEN HER
RUN DELIVERIES,

29:45.435 --> 29:47.089
LIKE, TWICE.

29:47.133 --> 29:51.398
SHE HAS OTHER GIGS.
YOU KNOW, SIDE HUSTLES.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.488
NICKY, WHAT'S UP?
WE'RE AT THE BACK DOOR

29:54.531 --> 29:56.098
OF THE LAB, BUT THERE'S
A SECURITY SYSTEM.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.360
I SENT YOU A PIC.

29:58.492 --> 30:01.321
IT'S A HARMAN.
COULD BE WORSE.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.155
HOW'S IT
COMING, ALTHEA?

30:09.198 --> 30:11.287
THERE'S A KNOWN VULNERABILITY
WITH THIS PARTICULAR MODEL.

30:11.331 --> 30:12.723
I'M SENDING YOU
A SKELETON KEY

30:12.767 --> 30:14.464
THAT I'VE BEEN
WORKING ON FOR YOU.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.031
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY, AND I

30:16.075 --> 30:18.164
HAVEN'T TESTED IT OUT YET,
BUT GIVE IT A TRY.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.124
OK. DOWNLOADED.

30:22.168 --> 30:23.778
OK, NOW HOLD YOUR PHONE
BY THE SENSOR

30:23.822 --> 30:24.997
AND WAIT FOR A BEEP.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.134
ALTHEA, IT WORKED.

30:32.178 --> 30:33.527
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

30:35.529 --> 30:36.965
THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH

30:37.009 --> 30:38.053
YOU AND YOUR
SISTERS, RIGHT?

30:38.097 --> 30:40.795
NICKY, SHE IS NOT NORMAL.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.231
NICKY? NO, NO, NO, NO.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.320
- SHE'S--
- SHE'S SUPER NORMAL.

30:44.364 --> 30:47.628
HA HA! SHE'S SO NORMAL,
SHE'S ACTUALLY BORING.

30:47.671 --> 30:49.412
MY BORING SISTER. UCCH.

30:49.456 --> 30:51.197
OK. SURE.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.377
OK, LOOK.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.076
THERE MIGHT BE
THINGS ABOUT NICKY,

31:01.120 --> 31:05.689
ABOUT MY FAMILY, THAT
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT.

31:05.733 --> 31:09.302
YET. BUT I PROMISE.

31:14.046 --> 31:15.177
RYAN?

31:15.221 --> 31:16.570
WHAT THE HELL IS
HE DOING HERE?

31:21.618 --> 31:23.142
HEY, I'M GLAD WE CAME.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.839
I LOVE SEEING YOU GET

31:24.883 --> 31:26.885
THE APPRECIATION
YOU DESERVE.

31:26.928 --> 31:29.104
HEY.
HEY.
HEY. WHAT'S UP?

31:29.148 --> 31:31.411
I THINK
WE SHOULD GO.

31:31.454 --> 31:34.022
WHAT? WHY?

31:34.066 --> 31:35.328
UM...

31:38.766 --> 31:39.898
OH, MY GOD.

31:39.941 --> 31:41.116
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

31:41.160 --> 31:42.509
I TAKE IT THIS GUY'S
NOT A FRIEND.

31:42.552 --> 31:45.164
MY OLD BOSS.
CHASE MATHESON.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.730
YOUR STORY IS IMPORTANT.

31:46.774 --> 31:47.818
WHAT YOUR BOSS DID TO YOU--

31:47.862 --> 31:48.907
FORMER BOSS.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.125
HE DID IT
TO OTHER WOMEN.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.344
WE HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND

31:51.387 --> 31:52.780
THE CONSEQUENCES
OF SPEAKING OUT.

31:52.823 --> 31:55.043
HE FALLS,
THEY FALL, TOO.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.175
DIDN'T END WELL?

31:56.218 --> 31:57.437
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.655
COME ON, BABE.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

31:58.699 --> 31:59.787
NO, NO, NO, NO.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.920
YOU SURE?

32:01.963 --> 32:03.182
I AM.

32:04.313 --> 32:06.054
HE'S NOT GONNA
DRIVE US OUT OF HERE.

32:06.098 --> 32:07.795
I WON'T LET HIM
RUIN OUR NIGHT.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.144
UGH.

32:13.975 --> 32:16.456
♪ HEY!
♪ DO THAT,
DO THAT, DO THAT ♪

WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

33:09.465 --> 33:10.945
WE'RE HERE FOR
THE JYU SA.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.294
THAT SO?

33:12.338 --> 33:13.730
YUP. YOU'RE
ABOUT TO

33:13.774 --> 33:15.515
HAND THAT STUFF OFF
TO A VERY BAD PERSON

33:15.558 --> 33:17.996
WHO'S GOING TO DO
VERY BAD THINGS WITH IT.

33:18.039 --> 33:19.432
CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

33:21.173 --> 33:22.435
OH, YEAH?

33:22.478 --> 33:24.002
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ABOUT IT?

33:24.045 --> 33:25.829
MIA?

33:25.873 --> 33:26.830
NOW.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.937
COVER ME.

33:53.596 --> 33:54.641
EY!

33:56.730 --> 33:58.123
THE JYU SA.

34:03.737 --> 34:04.781
MIA?

34:07.871 --> 34:09.047
MIA.

34:11.962 --> 34:13.573
MIA.
UHH!

34:15.749 --> 34:16.793
UHH.

34:19.318 --> 34:21.755
GRAB THE GEMS.
THE BUYER'S WAITING.

34:21.798 --> 34:23.887
WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS?
FORGET THEM.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.237
WE HAVE TO GO.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.112
NICKY, I'M SORRY.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.200
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED,

34:32.244 --> 34:33.680
BUT IT'S MY FAULT.

34:33.723 --> 34:35.595
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

34:35.638 --> 34:37.162
THE STONES DID
SOMETHING TO YOU.

34:37.205 --> 34:39.120
I FELT IT, TOO.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.469
THEY GOT EVERYTHING.

34:41.644 --> 34:42.776
NOT EVERYTHING.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.520
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT, OK?

34:47.563 --> 34:49.304
BUT FIRST, WE NEED
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.181
EXCUSE ME. YEAH.

34:56.224 --> 34:57.878
ONE MORE.
COMING UP.

35:02.143 --> 35:05.103
ALTHEA. I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.147
CHASE.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.583
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

35:07.627 --> 35:09.759
I'D HOPED THAT I'D
RUN INTO YOU SOMETIME.

35:09.803 --> 35:12.327
FUNNY. I'D HOPED
FOR THE OPPOSITE.

35:12.371 --> 35:14.242
LOOK, I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M

35:14.286 --> 35:17.811
REALLY GRATEFUL TO YOU.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.378
YOU'RE GRATEFUL?

35:19.421 --> 35:22.337
YEAH. YOU'VE CHANGED
MY LIFE.

35:22.381 --> 35:23.599
I MEAN, AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED,

35:23.643 --> 35:25.253
IT FORCED ME
TO LOOK INWARD,

35:25.297 --> 35:27.299
TO GROW AS A PERSON.
IT WAS A GIFT.

35:27.342 --> 35:30.432
I LEARNED TO STOP TALKING
AND TO START LISTENING.

35:30.476 --> 35:35.176
HAVING TO STEP DOWN
FROM CLOUDRUSH WAS HARD,

35:35.220 --> 35:39.093
BUT IT FORCED ME
TO BECOME A BETTER MAN.

35:39.137 --> 35:42.183
NEW AND IMPROVED.
CHASE 2.0.

35:42.227 --> 35:43.576
I'M JUST SORRY
THAT WE SAW

35:43.619 --> 35:46.448
OUR ENCOUNTER
SO DIFFERENTLY.

35:46.492 --> 35:51.453
OK, CHASE 2.0,

35:51.497 --> 35:55.327
WE DIDN'T SEE OUR
ENCOUNTER DIFFERENTLY.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.981
AND NO AMOUNT OF
FOCUS-GROUPED
REBRANDING BULL

35:58.025 --> 36:00.201
IS GONNA CHANGE
THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE A MONSTER

36:00.245 --> 36:02.290
AND A CREEP,
AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.162
ALTHEA, COME ON. NO.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.164
YOU'RE LISTENING,
REMEMBER?

36:06.207 --> 36:08.731
I HAVE SPENT
WAY TOO MUCH TIME
SINCE THEN

36:08.775 --> 36:10.907
THINKING ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED--

36:10.951 --> 36:12.735
WHAT YOU DID TO ME--

36:12.779 --> 36:14.824
AND I AM DONE.

36:14.868 --> 36:18.088
SEE, MY LIFE IS GOOD.
GREAT, EVEN.

36:18.132 --> 36:21.744
BUT YOU?
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.487
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
POWER OVER ME ANYMORE.

36:27.881 --> 36:29.622
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
THINKING I'D

36:29.665 --> 36:31.798
THROW THIS DRINK
IN YOUR FACE, BUT...

36:36.368 --> 36:38.587
YOU'RE NOT WORTH IT.

36:42.069 --> 36:44.376
OK. NOW WE CAN GO.
SHALL WE?

36:53.515 --> 36:56.562
DENNIS, YOUR WIFE JUST SAID
SHE CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT ME.

36:57.780 --> 37:00.043
COME ON. HEY.

37:00.087 --> 37:01.349
DENNIS.

37:05.571 --> 37:07.573
STAY THE HELL
OUT OF OUR LIVES.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.229
I'M A PART OF YOUR LIFE
WHETHER YOU

37:11.272 --> 37:13.361
LIKE IT OR NOT.

37:13.405 --> 37:14.797
JUST ASK YOUR DADDY.

37:14.841 --> 37:16.843
HE CUT TIES WITH YOU
WHEN ALTHEA CAME FORWARD.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.889
OH. YEAH,
MAYBE PUBLICLY.

37:19.933 --> 37:22.196
YOU KNOW,
FOR A NEW PARTNER,

37:22.240 --> 37:24.546
YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT
YOUR FAMILY BUSINESS.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.812
MESS HIM UP.

37:38.386 --> 37:39.605
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.

37:41.302 --> 37:42.608
IS THAT ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU BOYS?

37:58.319 --> 37:59.581
MR. HAN?

38:03.281 --> 38:05.500
MR. HAN. HEY.

38:24.389 --> 38:27.087
I'M VERY IMPRESSED, JULIETTE.

38:27.130 --> 38:29.263
THANK YOU, FATHER.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.265
THE REFINEMENT PROCESS--

38:31.309 --> 38:33.311
YOU AUTHENTICATED
THE JYU SA?

38:34.921 --> 38:35.965
HOW?

38:37.358 --> 38:39.926
IT WORKED.
I SAW IT.

38:39.969 --> 38:44.365
JUST THE MUSIC
AND THE GEM.

38:44.409 --> 38:47.412
JUST A TASTE OF
THESE STONES' POWER.

38:48.500 --> 38:51.329
WHEN MY EXPERTS
COMBINE IT WITH THE BELL

38:51.372 --> 38:54.810
AND WE HAVE EVERYTHING
THAT WE NEED...

38:54.854 --> 38:58.423
THIS CITY WILL
BE DESTROYED.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.513
AND FROM THE ASHES...

39:03.558 --> 39:06.648
A NEW WORLD
WILL BE BORN.

39:13.525 --> 39:14.830
HEY, MIA?

39:17.529 --> 39:19.357
WE CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL,

39:19.400 --> 39:20.575
AND I KNOW IT DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE IT,

39:20.619 --> 39:23.361
BUT WHAT WE DID
TODAY, IT HELPED.

39:23.404 --> 39:25.101
WE'LL FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE JYU SA IS,

39:25.145 --> 39:28.366
WHY IT AFFECTED US,
AND WE WILL STOP TAN.

39:28.409 --> 39:30.890
BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED
RYAN'S HELP

39:30.933 --> 39:32.065
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

39:33.414 --> 39:36.112
OK. I'LL TALK
TO HIM TOMORROW.

39:37.723 --> 39:41.422
