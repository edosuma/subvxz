00:10.333 --> 00:11.375
Otis..

00:12.333 --> 00:14.417
...maraschinos.

00:18.667 --> 00:20.500
- You wanna do 'em?
- No, you, mom.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.583
Yowie, I like how that looks.

00:27.667 --> 00:29.208
How do you like that, Otis?

00:29.291 --> 00:31.458
I like that.

00:31.542 --> 00:33.583
Now answer me truly,
after you've thought about it

00:33.667 --> 00:35.083
really thought about it,
and I don't want some

00:35.166 --> 00:37.208
off the cuff routine,
I want it from your heart.

00:37.291 --> 00:40.959
Are we done? You think about
it now, I mean it.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.250
Let's make chocolate.

00:42.333 --> 00:45.458
Let's make every
kind
of sweet ever.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.166
Absolutely, little man.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.500
Let's do it, we can
do anything we want

00:49.583 --> 00:52.625
because we are running on
a constantly replenishing

00:52.709 --> 00:54.291
fuel of love.

00:54.375 --> 00:56.750
- Do you understand that,
Otis?
- Yes.

00:56.834 --> 00:58.583
Put a trivet
on the table quickly.

01:02.041 --> 01:03.750
Dad's baked Alaska.

01:05.208 --> 01:07.875
Your father loves
this dessert, Otis.

01:07.959 --> 01:09.083
It's beautiful.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.417
How do eggs shape up
to look

01:13.500 --> 01:15.792
like the waves of the ocean,
Otis?

01:16.709 --> 01:18.583
Makes the world so small.

01:18.667 --> 01:20.041
Everything alike

01:20.125 --> 01:23.291
from the chickens
to the seaweed.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.792
[sighs]
It's awful comforting.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.625
I smell a forest fire.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.333
It's so beautiful.

01:47.417 --> 01:48.834
Do you see it?

01:48.917 --> 01:50.750
These colors, Otis.

01:50.834 --> 01:54.583
And to think we made this
from only eggs and love.

01:54.667 --> 01:57.375
I've never seen
anything like this.

02:01.792 --> 02:03.166
Mom, it's burning.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.500
Get some water.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.333
It's okay, little man.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.000
It can't hurt us.

02:08.083 --> 02:09.667
It may be a miracle, I think.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.917
This old lady dies
in her apartment in Fishtown.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.333
ME tracks down the son
who's next of kin.

03:12.417 --> 03:13.875
- This a homicide?
- Old age.

03:13.959 --> 03:15.166
Seems straightforward.

03:15.250 --> 03:17.542
But the guy drives
ten hours from Ohio

03:17.625 --> 03:20.333
to ID this Bettie Petrowski.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.291
Gets there, says,
"That ain't my mother."

03:23.375 --> 03:24.458
Meaning what?

03:24.542 --> 03:26.917
Meanin' the old lady
on the slab's a fraud.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.208
Ain't Bettie,
but she's been using

03:28.291 --> 03:29.959
her social security number
like she is.

03:30.041 --> 03:31.208
So where's the real Bettie?

03:31.291 --> 03:33.709
Unaccounted for since 1954.

03:33.792 --> 03:35.208
- Probably dead.
- Maybe murdered.

03:35.291 --> 03:37.291
Lil has the guy
looking
through Jane Does.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.458
Detective Valens.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.458
Sutton, this is Otis Petrowski.

03:48.959 --> 03:50.333
Oh, hi.

03:50.417 --> 03:52.041
Uh, sorry,
I-m-I'm blinking weird

03:52.125 --> 03:54.125
'cause I've had these
peepers on for hours now.

03:54.208 --> 03:56.291
So we're
thinking
whoever this is

03:56.375 --> 03:58.333
'might have killed your mom
in order to use her
identity.'

03:58.417 --> 03:59.583
Yeah, well, that's why

03:59.667 --> 04:01.333
I'm flipping through
these books of the dead.

04:01.417 --> 04:02.959
It would explain why
Otis hasn't heard from
her

04:03.041 --> 04:04.250
since he was eight years old.

04:04.333 --> 04:05.667
How do you account
for that growin' up?

04:05.750 --> 04:07.959
Well, my mother
was a mental patient.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.875
She had a breakdown
when I was eight.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.834
Almost burned down
the house with me in it

04:11.917 --> 04:15.166
so my father committed her
to the Philadelphia City
Asylum.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.625
What was going on
with your mom?

04:16.709 --> 04:19.166
Manic depression.
Bipolar is the new term.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.208
After she was committed,
you didn't see her anymore?

04:21.291 --> 04:23.041
Well, you know,
we visited her a few times

04:23.125 --> 04:25.500
but me and my dad
went our own way.

04:25.583 --> 04:27.041
He got married again.

04:27.125 --> 04:28.583
Did you ever try
to find your mom?

04:28.667 --> 04:30.417
Well, I mean, it's not like
I didn't toy with it

04:30.500 --> 04:32.041
but I figured
she forgot about me.

04:32.125 --> 04:34.542
The same way she forgot
she shouldn't be setting
fires

04:34.625 --> 04:35.792
around your kid.

04:39.417 --> 04:41.083
I don't need
to look at that twice.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.583
This is your mom?

04:48.667 --> 04:50.375
(Otis)
'That's her face.'

04:50.458 --> 04:51.500
You don't forget.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.375
(Valens)
'Jane Doe number 17.'

04:53.458 --> 04:56.000
Killed winter of '54.

04:56.083 --> 04:57.875
We only committed her
that summer.

04:57.959 --> 05:00.166
So if this is the real
Bettie Petrowski..

05:01.583 --> 05:03.375
Who's Frannie got in there?

05:43.083 --> 05:44.709
- Scotty.
- Hey.

05:44.792 --> 05:47.000
What's up, Jo?

05:47.083 --> 05:49.417
She's wiping us
clean
at poker is what.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.417
- Soft players here in
Homicide.
- Ah!

05:52.500 --> 05:55.542
Guy's not parked outside
your house anymore, is
he?

05:55.625 --> 05:58.083
- He's keeping his distance.
- Good.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.792
I gotta run.
Nice seeing you, Gil.

05:59.875 --> 06:01.709
- Yeah.
- Hey.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.458
What's that about?

06:04.542 --> 06:07.291
Sergeant White.
Guy's a real piece of work.

06:07.375 --> 06:09.583
Yeah, I heard rumors.
They had a thing?

06:09.667 --> 06:11.083
Yeah, only in his head.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.208
Sexual harassment thing.

06:13.291 --> 06:15.458
You saying she
filed
a report on him?

06:15.542 --> 06:18.083
She didn't have to.
Guy made a spectacle of
himself.

06:18.166 --> 06:20.291
'Cause everyone around here
thought it was the other
way.

06:20.375 --> 06:21.458
Her stirring it up.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.333
No, this White didn't
need to get stirred.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.417
She's lucky to get
transferred out.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.750
Leave that behind.

06:32.166 --> 06:34.041
The Jane Doe this guy
ID'd as his mom

06:34.125 --> 06:38.125
was found dead in Fairmount
Park, December 28th.

06:38.208 --> 06:40.291
"Blunt force
trauma
to the skull."

06:40.375 --> 06:41.834
No ID, no personal effects.

06:41.917 --> 06:44.667
Theory was Jane Doe's a
drifter,
killed by another drifter.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.000
No one ever made the connect

06:46.083 --> 06:48.417
that this Jane Doe
was a mental patient.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.542
She'd already checked out.

06:49.625 --> 06:50.625
Bettie Petrowski was signed out

06:50.709 --> 06:51.875
of Philadelphia City Asylum

06:51.959 --> 06:53.625
by Nurse Anika Olsen

06:53.709 --> 06:56.125
on December 26th, 1954.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.250
That's two days
before the body was
found.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.834
Family's gone,
out of the hospital.

06:59.917 --> 07:01.500
It's gotta be
a lonely time for Bettie.

07:01.583 --> 07:02.834
People lined up
to take advantage

07:02.917 --> 07:04.000
of a woman in that position.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.458
Not to mention
who she might have met

07:05.542 --> 07:06.917
in the hospital.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.250
Rooming with loonies,
some of them

07:08.333 --> 07:09.667
could have been
head-bashing types.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.750
Now, let's talk to this nurse.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.834
See if Otis can tell us
anything about the hospital.

07:13.917 --> 07:16.166
What about the Jane Doe 2005,
the one Frannie's got?

07:16.250 --> 07:18.417
Yeah, survey her neighborhood
in Fishtown.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.041
You gotta figure
we ID this Jane
Doe

07:20.125 --> 07:22.166
we're that much
closer
to finding Bettie's
killer.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.834
My-my daughter jumped in the car

07:29.917 --> 07:31.667
when she heard
I was coming here.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.166
'Wouldn't get out.'

07:33.250 --> 07:34.750
(Rush)
'That's nice of you.'

07:34.834 --> 07:36.250
Keeping your dad company.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.333
I wanna learn
about my grandmother.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.041
My thing is, just because
someone's manic depressive

07:41.125 --> 07:43.000
doesn't mean the family
has to, like, hide her.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.667
(Otis)
'Alright, alright,
we know what you think.'

07:46.041 --> 07:48.583
Otis, what can you tell
us
about City Asylum?

07:48.667 --> 07:50.000
Your mom have
any trouble there?

07:50.083 --> 07:51.417
Talk about problems with anyone?

07:51.500 --> 07:53.625
Oh, no, my mother
never complained.

07:53.709 --> 07:55.458
Especially in her up moods.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.542
The world was sunshine
and roses.

07:57.625 --> 08:00.083
I read on the
internet,
bipolar people

08:00.166 --> 08:01.875
can have full-on
hallucinations.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.250
So she might not have
seen
a dangerous situation

08:04.333 --> 08:05.875
for what it was.

08:05.959 --> 08:08.542
You know, the day we committed
her, that was definitely true.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.208
What didn't she see that day?

08:10.291 --> 08:11.834
The lunatics
crawling up the walls

08:11.917 --> 08:13.458
she was sharing with them.

08:17.166 --> 08:20.000
Your mommy will have
a wonderful, relaxing time

08:20.083 --> 08:21.834
here at our hospital.

08:21.917 --> 08:24.625
Dr. Paquette
is a superior doctor.

08:24.709 --> 08:26.875
He'll treat your mommy himself.

08:26.959 --> 08:28.875
Won't that be nice for her?

08:30.834 --> 08:31.709
Yes, ma'am.

08:31.792 --> 08:33.000
(Bettie)
'Hey, Otis.'

08:33.083 --> 08:34.792
This place is really
something else

08:34.875 --> 08:36.166
don't you think?

08:36.250 --> 08:38.500
Look at all these
different kinds of people.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.875
'I bet I'll come home with
all kinds of stories for
you.'

08:41.959 --> 08:44.458
Hey, you wanna know
what I wanna do?

08:44.542 --> 08:47.625
I want you and me to take
our own tour of this place.

08:47.709 --> 08:49.125
I wanna explore.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.500
I wanna know every inch of it.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.709
[screaming]
Stay away from me, fascists.

08:53.792 --> 08:55.000
Her painting is horrifying.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.834
- Grab it!
- Carmen, stop right there.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.750
Come any closer and I'll
show
the painting to the kid.

08:58.834 --> 09:01.208
No, it's got a lady..

09:01.291 --> 09:02.834
...with a zipper for a mouth.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.291
Hear that? This girl's
a painter, Otis.

09:05.375 --> 09:07.625
I have been in a fever
working on this.

09:07.709 --> 09:10.291
It's a vision of
what's
happening to us.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.125
'I plan to hang it
on the wall and say'

09:12.208 --> 09:16.458
"Good morning, you. It's
another
day in this dreadful place.

09:16.542 --> 09:18.792
Hold on for dear life."

09:18.875 --> 09:21.083
You're running
out of chances, Carmen.

09:21.166 --> 09:23.500
I'll show it to him.
I swear I will.

09:24.667 --> 09:25.709
Do it.

09:26.583 --> 09:28.500
Can I take a peek?

09:28.583 --> 09:30.709
Well, I bet it's just
out of this world.

09:30.792 --> 09:31.750
Bettie.

09:31.834 --> 09:32.917
Simmer down.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.291
It's beautiful.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.500
It's so sad.

09:49.583 --> 09:50.917
You lost it.

09:51.709 --> 09:52.792
You lost it!

09:53.750 --> 09:55.417
I hate you!

09:56.917 --> 09:59.125
If someone took my poetry away

09:59.208 --> 10:01.542
I would totally be
in a mental
hospital.

10:01.625 --> 10:03.667
You would totally be
in law school.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.750
So, uh, this Carmen's
doing these disturbing

10:06.834 --> 10:08.083
'paintings of women.'

10:08.166 --> 10:10.709
- It was a metaphor.
- It was twisted.

10:10.792 --> 10:13.542
Kids at school used to ask me,
"Where's your mother?"

10:13.625 --> 10:15.000
'What was I supposed to say?'

10:15.083 --> 10:17.667
"Taking retreat
with a maniac painter

10:17.750 --> 10:19.500
and assorted psychos?"

10:19.583 --> 10:22.834
I used to say mine was
on tour with a rock
band.

10:22.917 --> 10:25.458
So Carmen was pretty upset
with your mom.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.875
Foaming at the mouth.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.875
After seeing that girl
and her painting

10:29.959 --> 10:32.500
I thought for sure my mom would
meet her end at that place.

10:37.417 --> 10:39.500
Nurse Olsen,
you were the last person

10:39.583 --> 10:41.709
to see Bettie Petrowski alive.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.542
You signed her out yourself
from
the Philadelphia City Asylum.

10:46.625 --> 10:50.834
Everyone who came or went
did so through me.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.125
I was a one-woman
security check.

10:54.458 --> 10:55.542
What can you tell us
about Bettie

10:55.625 --> 10:56.792
the day she left?

10:58.083 --> 11:02.417
She...wore the
clothes
she came in with.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.542
She was in good spirits.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.625
Insisted on leaving
in spite of the fact

11:07.709 --> 11:10.417
that there were no family
members there to meet her.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.917
- Good memory on you.
- True.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.166
Was she worried about anything?

11:15.583 --> 11:17.250
Happy to leave.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.250
They usually were.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.417
Did Bettie make any
enemies during her
stay?

11:21.500 --> 11:22.583
Of course.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.917
One hundred and twenty women
in the same building

11:27.000 --> 11:29.041
'with only the task of recovery'

11:29.125 --> 11:31.375
to busy their idle minds.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.750
We talking cat fights?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.083
Cannibalism.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.166
You remember a girl
named Carmen?

11:38.667 --> 11:40.625
Carmen was explosive..

11:40.709 --> 11:42.041
Uh, moody..

11:42.125 --> 11:44.208
Distorted view of reality.

11:45.458 --> 11:48.333
But it was Zelda
that Bettie was truly afraid
of.

11:50.083 --> 11:51.709
(Bettie)
'Some days, I can't
get out of bed.'

11:51.792 --> 11:53.792
I've tried storing
casseroles
in the freezer

11:53.875 --> 11:55.542
so that the boys
will always have supper.

11:57.041 --> 11:58.959
Look at me now, babbling.

11:59.041 --> 12:00.375
Oh, please go on.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.250
Zelda, it's not
your turn to speak.

12:03.709 --> 12:06.375
My son's the only thing
for certain I've done right.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.500
Now I think he's afraid of me.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.959
Boo!

12:11.041 --> 12:13.208
I thought you were
gonna die at the end.

12:13.291 --> 12:15.458
That's the only kind
of story I like.

12:15.542 --> 12:17.875
You're absolutely vile, Zelda.

12:17.959 --> 12:19.208
I won't listen to it.

12:19.291 --> 12:21.291
Can it, ankle biter.

12:21.375 --> 12:23.500
- Give that back.
- What?

12:23.583 --> 12:25.333
- This?
- 'It's mine.'

12:25.417 --> 12:27.834
My son gave it to me
the day I came here.

12:27.917 --> 12:29.625
'It's all I have of him here.'

12:29.709 --> 12:30.750
Please.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.625
Then what do I get?

12:34.709 --> 12:36.959
Huh? You've got
everything I want.

12:37.041 --> 12:38.959
Why can't I get one lousy,
stinking thing?

12:39.041 --> 12:40.959
Zelda, on the count
of three, will you sit down

12:41.041 --> 12:42.834
with your arms crossed
across your chest--

12:42.917 --> 12:45.000
If you bring the guards in
here,
I'll absolutely faint.

12:45.083 --> 12:46.417
- 'One..'
- 'I will!'

12:46.500 --> 12:48.375
I got a kid, didn't make
it past two months

12:48.458 --> 12:49.792
- Two...
- And a cripple husband.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.917
- That's 'cause you pushed
him--
- That's it. Guard!

12:52.000 --> 12:53.667
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.667
He irked me, like you do.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.625
Maybe I ought to do an encore.

13:04.083 --> 13:07.041
So then, Zelda was jealous
of Bettie's life.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.583
Anything would be
better
than her own.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.375
Good motive
for the identity theft.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.834
What happened to this Zelda?

13:14.917 --> 13:15.959
She still committed?

13:16.041 --> 13:17.125
Oh, no.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.083
She was too tricky for that.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.875
So she got out 'spite there
being bats in the belfry?

13:22.959 --> 13:26.667
She persuaded Dr.
Paquette,
the chief of medicine.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.750
How, I don't dare imagine.

13:28.834 --> 13:30.792
I signed her out myself.

13:30.875 --> 13:31.959
When was that?

13:33.333 --> 13:35.333
The morning Bettie was released.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.583
And there's her opportunity.

13:49.125 --> 13:51.208
Zelda Amatuzzi? Philly PD.

13:51.291 --> 13:52.333
Oh, Zelda?

13:56.875 --> 13:59.250
Wanna talk to you
about Bettie Petrowski.

13:59.333 --> 14:01.333
Yeah, you knew her
at City Asylum.

14:01.417 --> 14:04.291
Yes, he said asylum. Carry on.

14:06.834 --> 14:09.417
We got people telling
us
you, uh, hated Bettie.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.125
Threatened to kill her like
you tried to do your
husband.

14:12.208 --> 14:14.083
Hey!

14:14.166 --> 14:17.166
If a worthless,
drunk son of a
bitch

14:17.250 --> 14:18.750
falls down the stairs

14:18.834 --> 14:20.166
and no one's around

14:20.250 --> 14:21.500
did he really fall?

14:21.583 --> 14:23.250
According to the police
report, yes

14:23.333 --> 14:25.250
'and at your hand.'

14:25.333 --> 14:27.917
Maybe you waited for her
outside the hospital.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Got her back
for having what you didn't.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.792
I didn't hate Bettie.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.917
Get yourselves
up to date, will
you?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.458
Well, do us the honors, Zelda.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.000
Bettie stuck up for me.

14:38.709 --> 14:40.291
She made
those other hens realize

14:40.375 --> 14:42.875
that I wasn't just loony
as they thought.

14:48.709 --> 14:50.834
(Bettie)
'Paint by numbers.'

14:50.917 --> 14:52.542
I feel like a trained seal.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.458
Carmen!

14:55.542 --> 14:57.291
Yes, Bettie?

14:57.375 --> 14:58.458
Come take a peek.

15:00.083 --> 15:02.083
Carmen..

15:02.166 --> 15:03.625
'...that is delightfully
creative.'

15:03.709 --> 15:05.625
[chuckles]
This thing? I don't know.

15:05.709 --> 15:07.125
I like it.

15:07.208 --> 15:10.625
Hey, bones, you could
use some of this food.

15:10.709 --> 15:13.834
Carmen had private art
lessons
with famous artists

15:13.917 --> 15:15.792
'cause her family's
got railroad money.

15:15.875 --> 15:20.166
(Carmen)
'Oh, which they put to good use
keeping me locked away in
here.'

15:20.250 --> 15:22.750
Why are you here, Carmen?

15:22.834 --> 15:25.750
I paint nude
ladies
and skeletons

15:25.834 --> 15:27.000
and sometimes derelicts

15:27.083 --> 15:28.875
with a bottle of
booze
in their hands.

15:28.959 --> 15:33.375
I'm a pervert and
a ne'er-do-well. Can't you
tell?

15:33.458 --> 15:36.667
If you're a pervert,
I'm Mamie Eisenhower.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.917
Everybody, can it!

15:39.000 --> 15:40.208
I hear him.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.583
Oh, all I wanna do is dance.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.875
- Oh, here she goes.
- What is it?

15:44.959 --> 15:46.959
You're imagining things, Zelda.

15:47.041 --> 15:49.333
She thinks
she hears Elvis
Presley.

15:49.417 --> 15:50.458
Who?

15:50.542 --> 15:51.959
He sings Negro music.

15:52.041 --> 15:55.166
- He invades my dreams.
- More like your head.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.291
At least I don't have
knee bones wider than my head.

15:58.834 --> 15:59.750
I hear it, too!

16:02.417 --> 16:04.959
- Hello.
- Anton.

16:05.041 --> 16:07.291
Woo-ee, there he is.

16:22.959 --> 16:26.709
And that's when
Anton
got his new hobby.

16:26.792 --> 16:28.709
Bettie Petrowski.

16:28.792 --> 16:29.834
So he pursued her?

16:29.917 --> 16:31.500
Like a dog on a scent.

16:31.583 --> 16:32.834
Did he know she was married?

16:32.917 --> 16:35.041
Oh, he'd strut
around
telling all of us

16:35.125 --> 16:38.000
he'd be the one
to turn her
head.

16:38.083 --> 16:40.041
Did she return the feelings?

16:40.125 --> 16:42.792
It's 1954.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.417
A young black kid's got the hots

16:44.500 --> 16:48.166
for a white married
lady
older than him.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.750
You think he had
a snowball's
chance?

16:56.667 --> 16:59.083
Let's talk about
Bettie Petrowski.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.917
We heard you
had it bad for her.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.542
She was a nice lady.

17:03.625 --> 17:05.792
Well, Bettie was killed,
you know.

17:05.875 --> 17:10.709
Skull bashed in, over her
right eye, an act of rage.

17:10.792 --> 17:12.834
I don't know
anything about
that.

17:12.917 --> 17:14.375
Ah, it must have hurt, Anton

17:14.458 --> 17:15.875
when you realized
it didn't matter

17:15.959 --> 17:18.417
if these ladies were locked
up,
sick in the head.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.375
You still weren't going
to be good enough for them.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.625
You were just the black boy
changing the sheets, right?

17:23.709 --> 17:26.834
[chuckles]
No, it wasn't like
that
in the hospital.

17:26.917 --> 17:28.291
How was it?

17:28.375 --> 17:30.417
Well, we could be friends.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.625
The way we
couldn't
on the outside.

17:32.709 --> 17:36.375
But you didn't wanna settle
for just friends with Bettie.

17:36.458 --> 17:39.667
Bettie was devoted
to her husband and her
boy.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.291
Said that they were what
kept her going in there.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.291
I'm a romantic.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.041
But you two got close.

17:49.125 --> 17:50.375
Yeah.

17:52.083 --> 17:54.792
Bettie got real
low
a few weeks in.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.667
They gave her
hydrobath
treatment.

17:57.750 --> 17:58.959
What's that?

17:59.041 --> 18:01.500
Well, it's bathtubs full of ice

18:01.583 --> 18:03.125
girls would have to soak in.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.291
Supposed to snap you
out of depression.

18:06.583 --> 18:08.959
I looked after her then.

18:09.041 --> 18:10.333
Learned about her.

18:19.458 --> 18:21.625
Bettie's not moving,
Anton. Take her out.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.709
Wait. Not yet!
It will help her soon enough.

18:23.792 --> 18:26.542
Have you had it?
'Cause I have.

18:26.625 --> 18:27.709
It don't work.

18:27.792 --> 18:29.917
Alright, girls.
I'm going in.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.125
(Zelda)
'Anton.'

18:50.041 --> 18:52.291
There you go.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.333
Bettie?

19:01.417 --> 19:02.458
That's it.

19:03.667 --> 19:05.750
Let me out.

19:05.834 --> 19:06.959
I'm not supposed to.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.417
Zelda wanted me
to give you
this.

19:15.208 --> 19:17.125
All your friends are
thinking
about you, Bettie.

19:18.375 --> 19:20.333
Otis.

19:20.417 --> 19:22.917
Why don't you tell me
about Otis?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.959
Tell me your favorite
time
with him.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.750
At the park.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.125
At the park.

19:30.208 --> 19:31.709
We went to the swings.

19:31.792 --> 19:35.208
Oh! My little sisters love that.

19:35.291 --> 19:36.583
It started to rain.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.000
Oh, no.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.417
Warm rain.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.834
Spring.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.625
Everybody ran to their cars.

19:47.834 --> 19:49.000
Not you?

19:51.208 --> 19:52.959
Otis wanted to stay.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.041
We did.

19:56.959 --> 19:58.208
We stayed.

19:59.709 --> 20:01.083
That's wonderful, Bettie.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.333
Let's get you out.

20:06.417 --> 20:07.417
You're all better now.

20:28.291 --> 20:30.959
(Terrence Petrowski)
'What is this?'

20:31.041 --> 20:32.166
What am I looking at?
Hey.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.917
What are you two doing?
You put her down.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.625
- I was making her warm, sir.
- You do not touch her.

20:37.709 --> 20:40.125
Bettie, Bettie,
you look at me.

20:40.208 --> 20:42.291
She's not feeling well, sir.
She's been in the tub--

20:42.375 --> 20:43.291
Get out!

20:47.125 --> 20:48.625
What are you doing to me?

20:51.542 --> 20:53.834
'You better run, boy.'

20:53.917 --> 20:58.041
He looked at me and
I thought I was a dead
man.

21:00.542 --> 21:02.291
The husband
ever follow up with you?

21:03.583 --> 21:05.458
No.

21:05.542 --> 21:07.208
Maybe he didn't
take it out on you.

21:08.625 --> 21:09.959
Took it out on Bettie.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.417
(Valens)
Hey, your car still out?

21:22.500 --> 21:23.625
I can get you home again.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.125
No, thanks.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.208
Me and Will were just leavin'.

21:33.291 --> 21:35.250
You two have a nice night.

21:38.041 --> 21:40.208
What are you doin'?

21:40.291 --> 21:41.542
Offerin' a ride.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.959
Maybe keep the charity
out of Vera's earshot.

21:45.208 --> 21:47.625
Ah, they're giving us grief.
It's nothin'.

21:47.709 --> 21:49.750
It's nothin'
when they do it to you.

21:53.875 --> 21:56.166
You know, you're not doing
yourself any favors.

21:56.250 --> 21:59.000
Clammin' up about what happened
with that Sergeant White.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.792
Sherman filled me in.

22:01.875 --> 22:03.333
Now, why don't you
tell the truth?

22:03.417 --> 22:04.667
'Cause Vera and them
are walking around

22:04.750 --> 22:06.417
thinking you're something
you're not.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.208
Some thing? Like what?

22:10.959 --> 22:12.375
A slut?

22:14.125 --> 22:15.917
Yeah, alright.
But you're not.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.959
Yeah.

22:17.041 --> 22:19.375
I'm saying
it'd be easier for you here

22:19.458 --> 22:21.250
if people knew the truth.

22:21.333 --> 22:24.250
Every guy I've ever
worked
with, cops, you guys..

22:25.917 --> 22:27.834
You guys mess around,
you get around.

22:27.917 --> 22:29.917
- You said it about
yourself.
- I've made mistakes.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.250
And whatever you
did...
no one gives you

22:33.333 --> 22:34.542
the up and down
in the office

22:34.625 --> 22:36.125
like you don't
deserve to be
here.

22:36.208 --> 22:37.500
And no one thinks
that about you.

22:37.583 --> 22:39.041
You don't have to
make
a presentation

22:39.125 --> 22:40.917
about personal stuff.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.083
None of you guys do.

22:43.166 --> 22:44.625
Why should I?

22:46.291 --> 22:47.834
It could help you.

22:50.792 --> 22:53.291
[sighing]
I'm not helping
myself that way.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.208
- Hey, Jo, let me drive you.
- I'm walkin'.

23:09.875 --> 23:12.583
Otis, your dad may have
thought your mother was..

23:12.667 --> 23:15.333
...having an affair
with a hospital
orderly

23:15.417 --> 23:17.250
a young black guy.

23:17.333 --> 23:19.125
A couple of obvious
problems there.

23:19.208 --> 23:21.959
No way, my mom was nuts
about my dad.

23:22.041 --> 23:24.166
She loved him like crazy.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.667
Like crazy.

23:25.750 --> 23:29.375
Oh, your mother took good care
of that cowboy you gave her.

23:29.458 --> 23:31.041
'Everyone we talked
to mentions her'

23:31.125 --> 23:33.083
having it around
all the time.

23:34.125 --> 23:37.208
I gave it to her
to protect her.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.750
Maybe, this is why mom
says you have trouble

23:40.834 --> 23:42.083
showing your feelings.

23:42.166 --> 23:43.625
Because of losing grandma.

23:43.709 --> 23:45.959
Oh, great.
You two analyzing me.

23:47.750 --> 23:51.625
Otis, did your dad ever
show
any violent tendencies?

23:51.709 --> 23:53.125
Any temper problems?

23:53.208 --> 23:56.333
My father wouldn't have lost
his head about some orderly,
no.

23:56.417 --> 23:57.792
How do you know?

23:57.875 --> 24:01.250
Because by then, my dad knew
he had to move on from my mom.

24:08.750 --> 24:12.375
(Terrence)
'Otis asked me when
you're coming home.'

24:12.458 --> 24:14.250
I don't wanna lie
to him anymore.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.500
Then tell the hospital
it's time for me to go.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.083
You're not better.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.291
They said they'd cure me.

24:21.375 --> 24:24.375
Doctor said
it's manic depression.

24:24.458 --> 24:27.083
- There is no cure.
- Not yet.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.166
You don't know what
they'll come up with
next.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.709
What do me and Otis do
until then?

24:32.041 --> 24:33.792
Put up with me?

24:33.875 --> 24:36.291
You almost killed
our son in a fire.

24:36.375 --> 24:37.709
I'm sorry.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.041
What is it, Terrence?

24:47.542 --> 24:49.083
I met a lady at church.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.333
Oh!

24:54.834 --> 24:57.417
Look, I've got to make
a good home for Otis.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.959
And I can't raise him
on my own.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.500
We're being punished.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.917
Me and the girls for
something
I did in art class.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.208
Terrence, I don't
think
I'll survive it

25:05.291 --> 25:06.583
if I don't have
Otis
to come home to.

25:06.667 --> 25:08.208
You're not good
for him, Bettie.

25:11.125 --> 25:12.291
You can't..

25:20.208 --> 25:22.375
I guess I'm no
good
to him sick.

25:24.166 --> 25:25.917
And there's no cure for that.

25:29.667 --> 25:31.792
I want Otis to have
the best life there
is.

25:33.041 --> 25:34.291
Promise.

25:34.375 --> 25:37.083
Promise me straight
from the heart,
Terrence.

25:37.166 --> 25:38.625
He'll get the best.

25:40.083 --> 25:41.458
I promise, Bettie.

25:47.333 --> 25:48.542
Alright.

25:57.667 --> 25:58.959
Otis, let's go.

26:05.333 --> 26:07.542
Oh, it's okay, little man,
you can take him.

26:09.041 --> 26:10.959
You give him to
me
next time, mom.

26:13.542 --> 26:15.625
I love you.

26:15.709 --> 26:17.208
Won't you hug your old mom?

26:35.125 --> 26:36.917
What was she being
punished for?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.333
- I don't know.
- Otis, when was this?

26:39.417 --> 26:40.834
Right before Christmas.

26:40.917 --> 26:43.500
Right before your mom
died,
right?

26:43.583 --> 26:46.625
Bettie said it was
she and the girls.

26:46.709 --> 26:49.542
Maybe, Zelda knows who
was being punished and why.

26:53.750 --> 26:56.542
(Valens)
'We heard, uh, Bettie
and her friends were punished'

26:56.625 --> 26:59.583
by the hospital
right around Christmas.

26:59.667 --> 27:01.667
Is it something
involving art class?

27:01.750 --> 27:03.291
That something involve you?

27:03.375 --> 27:05.417
Uh-huh, usually did.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.375
You're talking about
Bettie's big idea.

27:09.458 --> 27:10.875
(Sutton)
'What do you mean?'

27:10.959 --> 27:13.208
Well, see, Bettie had
this wacky idea

27:13.291 --> 27:16.917
that we needed some culture
for our brains

27:17.000 --> 27:19.834
and that Carmen would be
the one supplying it

27:19.917 --> 27:21.583
'vis-a-vis art class.'

27:23.500 --> 27:27.542
So, Carmen, the rich one,
she was the art teacher?

27:27.625 --> 27:29.041
But it was Bettie

27:29.125 --> 27:33.375
that got her heart set
on making this a real class.

27:33.458 --> 27:35.458
- Real, huh?
- Yeah.

27:35.542 --> 27:38.709
And, uh, that's how
Carmen got ruined.

27:40.375 --> 27:43.291
[giggling]
I need to stop giggling.

27:43.375 --> 27:45.750
This place echoes
like a church.

27:45.834 --> 27:48.542
I'm ready.
Consider me an artiste.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.083
Okay, we've been talking
about the human form.

27:51.166 --> 27:54.375
Last time, we did line
drawings
of each other's faces.

27:54.458 --> 27:57.417
Bettie did a very
beautiful drawing of Annie.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.041
'Tonight we move on
to the body.'

28:00.125 --> 28:03.041
Depicting the nude is an
ancient
tradition in art

28:03.125 --> 28:07.750
where artists sought to
depict
a more idealized human form.

28:07.834 --> 28:10.709
I'll say.
Betty, you're a
genius.

28:10.792 --> 28:14.125
It is said Michelangelo
believed
that the figure of David

28:14.208 --> 28:18.083
already existed inside the
block
of stone he was carving

28:18.166 --> 28:21.709
and that his art
would merely set David free.

28:23.166 --> 28:26.625
Carmen, I think we're ready
to be set free.

28:26.709 --> 28:28.417
I think I'll faint.

28:35.625 --> 28:36.709
Carmen!

28:36.792 --> 28:38.875
Oh, bones, just
take a deep
breath.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.834
No.

28:41.917 --> 28:43.542
This is absolutely forbidden.

28:43.625 --> 28:46.083
Absolutely against the..

28:46.166 --> 28:47.500
Holy Moses.

28:49.709 --> 28:51.166
'Mr. De La Rosa.'

28:52.959 --> 28:55.834
Say goodbye, Carmen.
This was your last chance.

28:55.917 --> 28:57.875
- No.
- It was my idea.

29:02.834 --> 29:05.208
It was Carmen's last chance
for what?

29:07.208 --> 29:10.583
[sighs]
It was after that,
that the hospital

29:10.667 --> 29:14.000
and her family decided
it was time..

29:14.083 --> 29:16.583
...for Carmen
to have her lobotomy.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.709
Because of the art class?

29:19.792 --> 29:22.667
Uh, the nude black man
pushed them over the edge.

29:22.750 --> 29:24.542
But how did Carmen feel
about getting the, uh..

29:24.625 --> 29:26.709
The old ice pick
through the eye?

29:26.792 --> 29:28.291
What do you think?

29:33.583 --> 29:35.166
It was the end
of her world.

29:50.792 --> 29:53.500
- So, this is how it is now?
- What?

29:53.583 --> 29:56.041
When you work with someone,
you need eye contact.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.792
It's your own business.

30:02.875 --> 30:04.750
- You're right.
- Thanks.

30:04.834 --> 30:06.208
I didn't mean
to make you upset.

30:06.291 --> 30:07.333
Alright.

30:07.417 --> 30:10.125
As far as you being
part of things here..

30:10.208 --> 30:11.792
...you've been real good
and everyone sees you

30:11.875 --> 30:13.875
pulling your weight.

30:13.959 --> 30:15.417
I'm tryin'.

30:18.667 --> 30:20.250
Okay.

30:20.333 --> 30:21.500
It's peace?

30:23.333 --> 30:24.375
Peace.

30:33.458 --> 30:34.959
I can't do this.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.166
[chuckles]
No, I know.

30:38.333 --> 30:39.375
I can't afford it.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.458
Yeah, me neither.

30:40.542 --> 30:42.375
So, don't look at
me
like that.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.000
I won't.

30:52.625 --> 30:53.750
Stand aside.

31:00.417 --> 31:01.583
Done and done.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.166
The hospital records say
Carmen went in

31:20.250 --> 31:21.667
for the lobotomy
but never checked out.

31:21.750 --> 31:24.166
I ran her name down
every which way.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.667
No trace of her after that.

31:25.750 --> 31:29.125
Here's why, the old lady
I brought Otis in to see

31:29.208 --> 31:30.375
she's Carmen Hays.

31:30.458 --> 31:32.500
Confirmed it
from dental records.

31:32.583 --> 31:35.250
So, Carmen stole
Bettie's identity.

31:35.333 --> 31:36.750
(Frannie)
'But here's what's screwy.'

31:36.834 --> 31:40.250
Carmen's body,
no trace of a
lobotomy.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.208
So, she got out
of it somehow.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.959
There's something interesting
with Bettie's remains though.

31:45.041 --> 31:47.917
This bone was broken when
Bettie's body was found in
'54.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.792
Autopsy report said
that was cause of death.

31:50.875 --> 31:53.208
- Blunt force trauma.
- But this break is clean.

31:53.291 --> 31:55.458
Consistent
with a surgical
break.

31:56.917 --> 31:59.417
Bettie's the one
who had the lobotomy.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.000
(Vera)
'So, Bettie goes
under the knife.'

32:01.083 --> 32:03.208
Carmen walks free
using Bettie's name.

32:04.417 --> 32:06.166
How's this get past
Nurse Olsen?

32:06.250 --> 32:07.750
The one-woman security check.

32:07.834 --> 32:09.500
'She would have known
Carmen from Bettie.'

32:11.291 --> 32:12.750
She was in on it.

32:17.834 --> 32:19.166
Nurse Olsen,
let me ask you.

32:19.250 --> 32:22.083
'You noticed anything
different
about Bettie Petrowski'

32:22.166 --> 32:23.917
'when you signed her
out of the hospital?'

32:24.000 --> 32:25.375
Different?

32:25.458 --> 32:28.667
Yeah, like maybe she's not
the same person she used to be?

32:28.750 --> 32:30.375
Like maybe she's Carmen?

32:33.458 --> 32:35.834
Look, you know what
we're talking about.

32:35.917 --> 32:37.542
No one checked in
or out of that hospital

32:37.625 --> 32:38.959
without going through you.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.500
That's true.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.875
And Bettie
Petrowski
checked out.

32:42.959 --> 32:44.250
Only it was really Carmen.

32:44.333 --> 32:46.041
You helped her escape
with Bettie's name.

32:46.125 --> 32:49.208
- Why would I do that?
- The Hays family was flush.

32:49.291 --> 32:51.250
Carmen would have
compensated you
nicely.

32:51.333 --> 32:53.458
I did not do anything
for Carmen.

32:53.542 --> 32:56.041
Then how do you explain
her getting out

32:56.125 --> 32:57.375
and Bettie getting
her lobotomy?

32:57.458 --> 32:59.959
You put your
professional
opinion aside

33:00.041 --> 33:01.709
and gave Carmen
what she paid you
for.

33:01.792 --> 33:05.208
You're wrong. It was my
decision
as a medical professional.

33:05.291 --> 33:06.959
To lobotomize Bettie?

33:08.542 --> 33:10.375
You have to understand.

33:10.458 --> 33:12.458
At the time, we thought
it was the cure.

33:15.792 --> 33:17.583
Absolutely not, Bettie.

33:17.667 --> 33:19.375
Wait, hear me out.

33:19.458 --> 33:20.959
I told her you'd never do it.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.166
- Bettie, just stop.
- No, I won't.

33:23.250 --> 33:26.583
Dr. Freeman is the foremost
lobotomist in the country.

33:26.667 --> 33:29.250
He is only in Philadelphia
twice a year.

33:29.333 --> 33:32.333
I'm saying Carmen
doesn't
want it, but I do.

33:32.417 --> 33:33.583
Let him take me.

33:33.667 --> 33:35.125
'I'm the one
who needs to be cured.'

33:35.208 --> 33:37.083
There's nothing
wrong
with Carmen.

33:37.166 --> 33:39.000
You are not a doctor, Bettie.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.667
Carmen's only problem's
she's trapped here by her
family

33:41.750 --> 33:43.500
and can't show
the world her
art.

33:43.583 --> 33:45.458
Wouldn't you like that, Carmen?

33:45.542 --> 33:49.458
- I don't need to be famous.
- But you need to be free.

33:49.542 --> 33:51.667
And the world needs you.

33:51.750 --> 33:54.083
How many people can
make pictures like
yours?

33:54.166 --> 33:55.625
I don't feel right
about this, Bettie.

33:55.709 --> 33:57.250
This is hare-brained,
isn't it?

33:57.333 --> 34:00.542
No. I've read it. Lobotomy's
meant to even out your moods.

34:00.625 --> 34:03.750
That's what I need.
So, I can see my Otis again.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.458
'Please.'

34:05.542 --> 34:08.500
Nurse, you said
Dr. Freeman's the best.

34:08.583 --> 34:11.125
- He is.
- This is my last chance.

34:11.208 --> 34:13.417
'If I wait, Otis will be
moved
on with another mother.'

34:13.500 --> 34:16.500
A lady from church,
and I'll have to let him go.

34:16.583 --> 34:20.750
- All I wanna do is paint.
- All I want is Otis.

34:24.375 --> 34:25.625
I'm sure.

34:30.125 --> 34:32.250
But somethin' in your plan
didn't go right

34:32.333 --> 34:34.625
'cause Bettie
never saw Otis again.

34:35.834 --> 34:38.000
The snowstorm ruined our plan.

34:38.083 --> 34:39.208
How?

34:41.333 --> 34:43.625
Roads were closed.

34:43.709 --> 34:46.208
So, instead of Bettie going
to the private hospital

34:46.291 --> 34:51.125
that Carmen had paid for, she
was brought back to City Asylum

34:51.208 --> 34:53.083
after the lobotomy.

34:53.166 --> 34:55.291
That's when Dr.
Paquette
got involved.

34:56.583 --> 34:57.959
The head of the hospital?

34:59.834 --> 35:01.250
What did he do?

35:03.250 --> 35:06.208
To protect the hospital
and his reputation..

35:10.041 --> 35:11.500
[sighing]
...he..

35:14.500 --> 35:16.500
He made Anton clean up..

35:17.458 --> 35:18.792
...my mess.

35:33.291 --> 35:34.458
Anton.

35:36.959 --> 35:39.834
Did Dr. Paquette tell you
to kill Bettie Petrowski?

35:40.834 --> 35:43.041
[sighing]
I don't remember that.

35:43.125 --> 35:45.291
You were her friend, Anton.

35:45.375 --> 35:47.083
You cared about her.

35:47.166 --> 35:48.875
Don't tell me this
doesn't eat at you.

35:49.917 --> 35:51.291
He said to get rid of her.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.875
Said nobody would
miss her, anyhow.

35:57.959 --> 35:59.417
Otis missed her.

36:01.250 --> 36:02.792
I thought I could save myself..

36:04.709 --> 36:06.083
...and my little sisters.

36:07.417 --> 36:09.750
But I made a bargain
with the devil that day.

36:13.291 --> 36:14.583
What happened?

36:14.667 --> 36:17.291
He told me he'd use
the art class against me.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.250
Turn it into
a sexual allegation.

36:23.834 --> 36:25.125
If I went to jail

36:25.208 --> 36:27.667
there'd be nobody to take care
of my sisters.

36:32.083 --> 36:34.041
Where did you take her?

36:34.125 --> 36:35.667
She was like a child.

36:39.333 --> 36:41.083
Couldn't fend for herself.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.083
I put her in my truck.

36:49.917 --> 36:52.083
She couldn't understand
where we were going.

36:57.208 --> 37:00.166
I don't know if Otis
still remembers this..

37:03.041 --> 37:05.917
...but I always thought it
should go back to him some way.

37:14.208 --> 37:15.917
What did you do with
her,
Anton?

37:19.917 --> 37:21.583
I tried to be merciful.

37:31.542 --> 37:32.917
It's alright, Bettie.

37:35.458 --> 37:37.166
Isn't it
beautiful
outside?

37:40.917 --> 37:42.291
It's not so bad.

37:46.583 --> 37:47.875
Not so bad.

38:09.083 --> 38:10.375
(Anton)
'The park.'

38:12.125 --> 38:13.750
That's the park.

38:16.667 --> 38:17.875
Otis..

38:24.875 --> 38:26.166
Right, Bettie.

38:49.625 --> 38:51.750
Remember when you and Otis
went to the park?

38:53.458 --> 38:54.750
It started to rain.

38:56.208 --> 38:57.917
Everybody else wanted
to go to their car

38:58.000 --> 38:59.625
but not Otis.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.333
You wanna go on
down there?

39:04.417 --> 39:06.125
Go on out to the swings?

39:07.625 --> 39:08.750
Yes.

39:11.834 --> 39:13.041
Okay.

39:19.917 --> 39:22.041
It was springtime, Bettie.
Remember?

39:23.625 --> 39:24.917
It was a warm rain.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.208
Just like now.

39:28.083 --> 39:29.625
So, you won't be cold.

39:32.834 --> 39:34.125
Go ahead now.
