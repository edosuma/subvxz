00:56.056 --> 00:56.891
Two coffees, please.

00:56.974 --> 00:57.892
[Female] <i>Okay.</i>

00:58.726 --> 01:00.185
Flashbacks...

01:00.351 --> 01:01.687
Dream sequences...

01:01.770 --> 01:04.105
Aww, karaoke! I love karaoke!

01:04.189 --> 01:06.149
Of course, you do.
Everybody loves karaoke.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.400
It's Dramaworld.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.444
Cure and incurable diseases...

01:10.403 --> 01:11.739
Fainting spells?

01:11.947 --> 01:12.865
Oh.

01:12.948 --> 01:15.408
Leading men, even second leads,
they can't let women hit the ground.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.368
It's like... totally subconscious.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.829
[female] <i>Your coffee's ready.</i>

01:18.913 --> 01:19.914
Try it. [Claire giggles]

01:21.456 --> 01:23.249
Hmm...

01:25.251 --> 01:26.336
[breathes nervously]

01:26.544 --> 01:27.922
-Are you okay?
-Oh.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.799
You're lucky I just happened to be here.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.592
Thank you.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.307
-[Claire] Neat!
-[female #1] <i>Are you ready to order?</i>

01:39.390 --> 01:41.852
-[Seth] This is Dramaworld.
-[male #1] <i> I'd like an ice americano.</i>

01:41.936 --> 01:44.229
Some things just have a magnetic pull
on characters.

01:44.312 --> 01:46.774
-They can't help it.
-I'll have to remember that.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.317
"Chapter nine, Justice."

01:49.400 --> 01:51.737
Oh, not that kind of drama.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.656
Okay. Um...

01:54.197 --> 01:56.407
Ooh, oh!
Off-screen manipulation, yes! Okay.

01:57.076 --> 01:59.536
"The power of facilitation lies
behind the scenes..."

01:59.620 --> 02:01.080
Blah, blah, blah...

02:01.287 --> 02:04.249
"While grand romantic gestures
take the audience by surprise...

02:04.332 --> 02:06.584

-off-camera abetment."

-[Claire] Oh my god, are you okay?
-Ugh

02:16.177 --> 02:18.596
-Oh, you're alive! Seth, he's alive!
-Ugh.

[romantic music]

02:25.688 --> 02:29.024
-My ideal woman!
-[female #2] <i>Siwon, are you okay?</i>

02:30.275 --> 02:31.442
What's wrong with you?

02:32.987 --> 02:34.905
-Snap out of it!
-My ideal woman!

02:35.238 --> 02:37.700
-Where are you going? Give me your number!
-What are you doing?

02:38.283 --> 02:39.242
Let go of me!

02:39.325 --> 02:41.244
-I need your number!
-Siwon!

02:41.327 --> 02:44.123
[Seth] Claire, you have to
be careful here.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.456
This world is sensitive.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.542
-He got hit by a car!
-[female #2] I said, come here!

02:47.625 --> 02:50.045
It's Dramaworld, man!
Cancer, memory loss, hit and runs...

02:50.129 --> 02:51.546
they're all just furthering the story.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.339
-But... I....
-Okay, look.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.341
I'll clean up the mess you just made,

02:55.425 --> 02:58.511
but you can't be background now.
You have to go be Seo-yeon's advocate.

02:58.595 --> 02:59.930
I really don't think I can do that.

03:00.014 --> 03:04.143
Okay. I can only clean up
one mess at a time, Claire.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.228
You need to go to Joon
and get him to rehire her.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.313
How?

03:08.856 --> 03:09.982
Here! Go!

03:18.489 --> 03:20.283
We're not open yet...

03:21.118 --> 03:22.119
Seo-yeon!

03:24.079 --> 03:25.538
Did something happen?

03:26.874 --> 03:30.543
Do you mind if I hang out here
while I look for a job?

03:31.502 --> 03:34.006
I'm too broke to go to a cafe.

03:34.173 --> 03:37.342
I've got plenty of coffee.
Do you want some?

03:37.425 --> 03:39.510
-Yes.
-Come on in.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.374
-Claire, hi.
-Hi.

04:09.457 --> 04:12.753
Um, listen, about last night...

04:13.921 --> 04:15.798
You really shouldn't have fired Seo-yeon.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.383
Really?

04:21.220 --> 04:22.387
Hang on one sec.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.142
Okay.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.021
Remember when she first started working
as your dishwasher, right?

04:31.105 --> 04:34.691
She would walk past you way too often,
just so she could see

04:34.775 --> 04:37.485
however you were cooking,
whatever you were cooking.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.653
Right?

04:39.238 --> 04:41.364
[upbeat music]

04:44.034 --> 04:45.035
Um...

04:46.452 --> 04:49.706
Okay. Remember, right...
when she...

04:50.331 --> 04:53.085
slipped and sprained her ankle, right?
But she wouldn't go home.

04:53.168 --> 04:56.462
So she just spent the whole shift
hopping around on one foot?

05:00.466 --> 05:02.677
Can you look over there for me? Okay.

05:03.178 --> 05:08.100
Like, far off into the distance...
Farther... Okay. And...

05:09.226 --> 05:10.936
Remember, uh...

05:12.896 --> 05:13.814
Um...

05:15.606 --> 05:16.859
How do you know all this stuff?

05:16.942 --> 05:18.401
You've only been here two days.

05:19.278 --> 05:22.281
I'm... I'm like... really smart.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.199
You're...

05:24.741 --> 05:25.742
different.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.703
Uh, you need to rehire Seo-yeon.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.122
Why?

05:31.165 --> 05:32.582
Mm, hang on! Sorry.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.461
[Claire] "Confident, handsome, arrogant,

05:36.544 --> 05:39.380
but always believe
in lady's best interest at heart."

05:40.048 --> 05:42.425
Okay. The reason you opened this place

05:42.508 --> 05:44.510
instead of taking over
your family business was because

05:44.594 --> 05:47.638
you hated the idea
of everything being frozen.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.142
You wanted a place with warmth.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.517
Right?

05:54.980 --> 05:58.441
It's a metaphor!
It's your heart that's frozen.

05:59.193 --> 06:04.614
[soft music]

06:05.365 --> 06:12.164
This is a place where people find comfort
and a home and... love.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.461
Don't you want it to stay that way?

06:30.807 --> 06:32.976
-You're right.
-Yes! Up high!

06:38.232 --> 06:39.649
Okay.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.491
So, what, what are you going tosay?
Are you gonna invite her to sing karaoke?

06:48.616 --> 06:50.451
Karaoke? It's not even noon yet.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.037
Oh, right...

06:53.080 --> 06:54.998
[texting beeps]

06:55.581 --> 06:56.707
There.
[phone clanks]

06:57.376 --> 06:58.377
Did you apologize?

06:58.459 --> 06:59.460
Better.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.546
Go wash your hands.

07:04.007 --> 07:04.924
[text message beeps]

07:12.640 --> 07:13.934
[sighs deeply]

07:23.944 --> 07:24.987
How about a drink?

07:26.904 --> 07:29.824
I'm not really in the mood.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.578
Not even rice wine?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.418
You're ridiculous!

07:42.045 --> 07:43.297
Heads up!

07:44.505 --> 07:45.673
You okay?

07:45.756 --> 07:46.841
[Claire] That's okay.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.759
It happens all the time.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.429
Grate that.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.679
Sprinkle a bit of sea salt,

07:51.762 --> 07:53.473
a touch of cider vinegar,

07:53.598 --> 07:56.059
give it a toss, and then a dash of...

07:57.935 --> 07:59.645
ghost pepper hot sauce!

08:00.480 --> 08:01.772
Super careful with that.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.816
It's pretty much the spiciest thing
on the planet.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.654
[clears throat]
So... um, what are we doing?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.407
Getting Seo-yeon back.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.741
With radishes?

08:11.908 --> 08:15.120
Some men are poets. Some men...

08:15.703 --> 08:17.080
this is all we got.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.960
-Let me take just one photo!
-[Do-hwan] I can't do it.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.962
Please, just one picture!

08:25.047 --> 08:26.714
-Please, Do-Hwan!
-Fine, fine, Seo-yeon!

08:29.634 --> 08:31.011
Do-hwan! [screaming]

08:38.352 --> 08:41.146
[upbeat music]

08:45.233 --> 08:46.318
So, Claire...

08:47.152 --> 08:48.403
Tell me about yourself.

08:48.487 --> 08:49.446
What's your deal?

08:49.529 --> 08:53.408
Uh... me? I'm... I'm nothing.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.995
Hey, don't you think that
Seo-yeon is much nicer than Ga-in?

08:58.121 --> 08:59.247
Seo-yeon?

09:00.165 --> 09:01.666
She's a fantastic sous chef.

09:03.335 --> 09:04.503
Where're you from?

09:04.627 --> 09:06.046
Oh, it doesn't matter.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.713
Of course it does.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.758
My father says that
if you don't know where you came from,

09:11.008 --> 09:13.010
you don't know where you're going.

09:15.514 --> 09:16.639
Said.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.353
My father passed recently.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.314
Yeah... I heard.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.777
He didn't just pass,

09:29.860 --> 09:31.154
he killed himself.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.991
And if I could just understand why...

09:36.284 --> 09:38.537
then maybe everything else
might make sense.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.747
Yeah, um...
[scraping sound]

09:42.082 --> 09:43.250
Well, like...

09:43.708 --> 09:44.709
Ow!

09:44.792 --> 09:46.545
-Careful. Did you hurt yourself?
-Uh, no.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.339
No, it's not bad. It's just a scrape.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.425
[Claire mumbling]

09:54.635 --> 09:56.096
What's your father like?

09:57.139 --> 09:58.557
My dad?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.894
He worries about me a lot, I think.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.232
Especially since Mom...

10:09.775 --> 10:12.154
Well, since she's been gone
it's been different.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.240
-Did she...
-Yeah.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.826
He's changed a lot since it happened.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.329
He doesn't smile much anymore...

10:22.663 --> 10:26.418
I guess she was the one that always
brought the happy to the relationship?

10:26.626 --> 10:31.506
You know, she, she was a lot
like your dad. Just... full of joy.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.052
How do you know about my father?

10:36.261 --> 10:39.847
Oh, I... I don't! I mean, I... it's...

10:41.600 --> 10:42.476
Uh...

10:42.559 --> 10:43.684
Claire?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.854
[Claire winces in pain]

10:47.855 --> 10:49.815
No, no, no, don't!
That's just going to make it...

10:49.899 --> 10:51.776
-Ah!
-Worse.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.157
Okay, there you go.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.201
All right.
[panting]

10:59.576 --> 11:00.910
Calm down.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.163
You okay?

11:05.457 --> 11:07.875
What is that? Liquid fire?

11:08.460 --> 11:09.752
Basically.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.004
Hold on.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.306
In just the right amount...

11:26.727 --> 11:28.230
Oh my god!

11:37.947 --> 11:38.948
Uh, we should...

11:41.326 --> 11:43.411
Right, back to it.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.168
[sizzling sound]

11:58.510 --> 12:00.803
[Claire] Grand romantic gesture, done...

12:00.970 --> 12:02.763
Done, okay! What time is she coming?

12:02.972 --> 12:04.307
She didn't write me back yet.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.937
You apologized and she just left it?

12:12.148 --> 12:13.858
What did you say to her?

12:14.233 --> 12:16.695
[Claire]
"You're not fired. Can you come in now?"

12:17.820 --> 12:18.946
Yeah.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.741
That's not an apology!

12:22.825 --> 12:23.784
What're you talking about?

12:23.868 --> 12:25.995
"I'm sorry" is an apology.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.081
-Boy, you are...
-"I was a jerk" is an apology.

12:29.624 --> 12:30.709
I'm not very good with words.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.961
You don't need to be good with words
to say sorry, Joon! Sorry is one word!

12:34.044 --> 12:37.716
You need to find where she is
and apologize to her, properly!

12:39.842 --> 12:41.010
Fine, I'll go.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.221
Let's just eat this now then, okay?

12:44.306 --> 12:46.015
So it doesn't go to waste?

12:50.687 --> 12:51.730
Fine.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.023
Just hurry.

12:58.068 --> 13:02.990
[ominous music]

13:13.627 --> 13:16.837
We need to meet.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.549
Let's go, come on! A little urgency here?

13:19.633 --> 13:21.760
We just had a huge meal. Relax.

13:21.884 --> 13:22.761
Savor.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.970
Yes, you just made me
the best meal of my life.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.641
I really appreciate it.
But I need you to focus up!

13:27.973 --> 13:29.726
-Okay? All right.
-Right. Right.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.394
'Cause you need a sous chef.

13:31.478 --> 13:35.314
And you know as well as I do
that the only person who can do that is...

13:35.607 --> 13:37.609
-Yeah?
-Is...

13:38.360 --> 13:39.611
Yeah, Seo-yeon, I know.

13:39.694 --> 13:40.861
Joon?

13:41.070 --> 13:42.279
Yeah?

13:42.364 --> 13:43.906
Who is that?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.494
It's a girl.

13:49.788 --> 13:53.082
Drunken piggybacks. "Magnetic pull".

13:53.249 --> 13:54.291
Weird.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.007
[chilling music]

14:02.091 --> 14:03.926
There's a new problem.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.099
[zipper squeaks]

14:16.856 --> 14:19.066
[Claire] Okay, she's going to open
the door and then you say,

14:19.149 --> 14:20.777
"I was a jerk," and "I'm sorry."

14:20.860 --> 14:23.405
And that's it, it's really easy.
Do you want to practice on me?

14:24.238 --> 14:25.699
[clears throat]

14:32.955 --> 14:35.375
Or... maybe not. I mean, we're here, so...

14:35.458 --> 14:37.126
[doorbell rings]
[Claire] It's fine.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.045
You better have an explanation for this.

14:40.129 --> 14:45.175
You told me it would all work out for me
as long as I followed your directions.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.970
So how do you explain
what Joon is doing with her?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.139
[Seth]
An unintended consequence.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.852
If I don't get what I want

14:53.934 --> 14:56.730
you won't get what you want, either.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.191
[Seth] You should watch your tone.

15:01.317 --> 15:05.530
[chilling music]

15:05.613 --> 15:07.699
And don't worry.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.920
I always get what I want.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.549
