00:12.360 --> 00:14.800
When you're single, and your friends start to get married,

00:14.880 --> 00:18.560
every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation:

00:18.840 --> 00:21.640
"Will you be bringing a guest, or will you be attending alone?"

00:21.960 --> 00:23.520
What it's really asking is,

00:23.640 --> 00:25.480
"Where do you see yourself in three months?

00:25.600 --> 00:28.640
Sitting next to your girlfriend, or hitting on a bridesmaid?"

00:29.120 --> 00:31.480
I always checked that I was bringing a guest.

00:31.960 --> 00:32.880
I was an optimist.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.120
Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?

00:37.320 --> 00:39.640
Ted, have you ignored all my teachings?

00:39.720 --> 00:40.920
For the most part, yeah.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.320
No, you don't bring a date to a wedding.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.760
That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.520
Oh, Ted. Oh, Ted. No-- no date.

00:47.640 --> 00:50.120
Deer carcass? Really? That's the metaphor you're going with here?

00:50.200 --> 00:51.640
Ted, it's a simile.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.880
Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date,

00:53.960 --> 00:56.880
a $200 piece of chicken/salmon will go uneaten.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.480
I got to bring someone, but who?

00:58.640 --> 01:00.320
Of course, I knew who I wanted to bring.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.880
Robin-- the big unanswered question in my life.

01:03.960 --> 01:07.360
Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.120
Derek.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.680
Well, Derek and I just broke up.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.120
Oh, no, that's terrible! Are you okay?

01:15.160 --> 01:16.560
Yeah, do you need a drink or something?

01:16.680 --> 01:18.320
Nah... We never really clicked.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.240
I felt bad, though. He was pretty bummed.

01:20.360 --> 01:21.640
Ah, don't beat yourself up.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.120
He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's, like, a billionaire.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.760
He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in ten chicks hotter than you.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.080
Thanks. I feel a lot better.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.880
I think I'll get that drink now.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.880
Okay, guys, I got to say something.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.360
I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.

01:40.760 --> 01:43.920
Oh, please-- they were buried in a shallow grave.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.960
Not again. Come on. Dude?

01:46.080 --> 01:47.520
We all know how this movie ends.

01:47.640 --> 01:51.760
Ted falls in love, love kicks Ted in the sprouts, roll credits.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.360
No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture.

01:54.520 --> 01:55.400
Fact:

01:55.640 --> 01:57.640
Robin was into me when we first met.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.000
Fact:

01:59.080 --> 02:02.200
Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof.

02:02.560 --> 02:03.600
Fact:

02:03.680 --> 02:06.120
On New Year's Eve, we kissed again.

02:06.320 --> 02:07.200
Fact:

02:07.360 --> 02:08.919
I need a date to this wedding.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.039
Wish me luck.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.480
What I don't get is why is Claudia marrying Stuart?

02:14.600 --> 02:16.200
She's way hotter than him.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.320
How way?

02:17.480 --> 02:18.960
Way way.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.720
This wedding does sound pretty amazing, though.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.840
Fancy hotel ballroom,

02:25.040 --> 02:26.440
everybody all dressed up...

02:26.560 --> 02:28.160
Oh, here we go.

02:28.280 --> 02:28.720
What?

02:28.840 --> 02:30.600
We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans

02:30.720 --> 02:33.640
because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.040
Oh, yeah. Okay, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.

02:36.120 --> 02:36.880
I thought so.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.000
You know what? Excuse me if I don't want to get married

02:40.120 --> 02:43.800
barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-One's-Going-To-Drive-That-Far.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.920
Yes. I want a ballroom,

02:46.040 --> 02:48.520
and I want a band, and I want shoes.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.400
I've been dreaming about this day since I was, like...

02:51.520 --> 02:53.000
A little girl?

02:53.520 --> 02:54.480
What up!

02:54.640 --> 02:58.240
Okay. I'm just saying that it's my wedding, too, and I should have a say in it.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.240
Yes, but I'm the bride, so I win.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.480
Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.480
Right, but I'm the bride, so I win.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.040
I mean, seriously-- Claudia and Stuart?

03:09.160 --> 03:12.600
I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness,

03:12.720 --> 03:14.200
but, you know, I was drunk.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.880
There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.320
You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship

03:21.400 --> 03:23.600
is to celebrate someone else's successful one.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.200
Oh, it makes sense.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.280
So, with that in mind, uh, our friends Claudia and Stuart

03:28.360 --> 03:30.640
are having this crazy black-tie wedding on Saturday.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.320
You want to be my plus one?

03:32.440 --> 03:35.600
Ooh... "Plus one." You make it sound so romantic.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.680
Fine.

03:38.240 --> 03:39.640
You want to be my date?

03:40.040 --> 03:41.280
Your date?

03:42.160 --> 03:43.280
I'd love to.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.600
How fancy are we talking about here?

03:45.680 --> 03:47.280
Oh, you're going to want to bring your "A" game.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.400
Oh, I'll bring it.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.680
I'll bring it so hard, the bride's going to look like a big white bag of crap.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.240
Lily? I need a dress.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.000
You're going? That's awesome!

03:57.120 --> 03:58.840
Oh, my God-- four days to find a dress?

03:58.920 --> 04:00.440
I know, it's a suicide mission.

04:00.520 --> 04:04.280
Well, if we leave now... we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it!

04:04.440 --> 04:05.320
Bye, babe.

04:06.640 --> 04:09.000
Whoa! Did you see how fired up she was?

04:09.080 --> 04:10.520
I don't know, there's something there.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.920
And, come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne...

04:13.920 --> 04:14.640
Who  knows?

04:14.720 --> 04:17.160
Wow. Ted, you're going to have to find another gender for yourself,

04:17.240 --> 04:19.560
'cause I'm revoking your "dude" membership.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.000
Yeah... how was that manicure yesterday?

04:22.800 --> 04:24.160
Invigorating, thanks.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.080
Okay, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys,

04:28.160 --> 04:30.640
but  back then I really thought that's how it worked.

04:35.080 --> 04:38.440
You put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting...

04:41.120 --> 04:42.440
the stars line up...

04:43.440 --> 04:44.800
and shazam.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.600
I know now that life is never that simple.

04:49.720 --> 04:50.680
Hey, Claudia!

04:51.600 --> 04:55.160
Yes, I want Tahitian Vanilla! You wrote it down wrong?

04:55.280 --> 04:56.640
No, no, no, no, listen to me--

04:56.760 --> 04:59.160
if I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian Vanilla,

04:59.240 --> 05:01.480
I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground!

05:01.640 --> 05:03.320
Do you want to find out if I'm kidding?

05:03.440 --> 05:04.160
Yeah, good-bye.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.640
Hey!

05:08.080 --> 05:09.080
How's it going?

05:09.320 --> 05:11.560
My wedding is in two days, that's how it's going.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.000
Oh, don't worry, it's going to be great. I'm so excited.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.840
Well, you should be-- lots of single girls.

05:15.920 --> 05:20.400
Oh, well, yeah, I'm... bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.240
What?

05:21.320 --> 05:22.440
I'm bringing a date.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.880
You're not bringing a date.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.520
Uh... yes, I am.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.640
Uh, no, you're not.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.600
I checked "plus one."

05:28.680 --> 05:29.720
No, you didn't.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.840
Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...

05:31.960 --> 05:33.520
Ted, you did not check "plus one"!

05:33.600 --> 05:35.320
You are not bringing a date to my wedding!

05:38.880 --> 05:40.600
Wait, I've already invited someone.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.280
You are not bringing a guest, Ted!

05:42.360 --> 05:44.480
The guest list has been closed for months-- months!

05:44.560 --> 05:47.040
But I checked "plus one"! I always check "plus one"!

05:47.120 --> 05:49.240
You absolutely did not check "plus one"!

05:49.320 --> 05:51.440
If you had checked "plus one," I would have called you to get the name of your guest,

05:51.480 --> 05:52.960
so I could have the place cards printed up.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.240
Did I call you to get the name of your guest?

05:54.320 --> 05:56.080
Is there a place card with her name printed on it?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.440
She doesn't need a place card. She knows her name.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.880
What's she eating?! Huh?! You ordered the chicken. What did she order?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.280
Do you see how your story is full of holes?

06:03.840 --> 06:05.800
Come on, Claudia, we go way back.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.680
Isn't there room for just one more person?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.600
Don't make me hurt you, Ted.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.320
I don't believe this! Claudia's crazy!

06:13.440 --> 06:15.200
But, to be fair, she's also hot.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.440
I totally checked "plus one." I'm sure I did.

06:17.520 --> 06:18.680
- Yeah, right.
- I did!

06:18.760 --> 06:21.000
Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.560
Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date.

06:23.640 --> 06:28.200
See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down, you're single.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.920
It's your default setting.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.640
Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.840
Oh, great, here comes the little Barney speech.

06:34.960 --> 06:39.360
Behind a curtain, in a dark little room secretly controlling your every move?

06:39.440 --> 06:41.480
- A little Barney...
- A little Barney.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.440
A little Barney.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.840
And you know what he said?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.800
"Ted... you will bring no dates to this wedding.

06:49.880 --> 06:54.480
You... will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney."

06:54.600 --> 06:56.240
Wow. Please stop.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.560
I got to call Claudia. If I just explain to her...

06:58.680 --> 07:00.360
Ted, no! Let it go.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.720
She's about to get married, she's got enough to worry about.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.040
Then what am I going to do?

07:04.120 --> 07:07.440
The only thing you can do-- tell Robin she can't come.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.520
Just a second!

07:15.080 --> 07:16.320
- Hey!
- Hey. Listen...

07:16.360 --> 07:20.040
Wait, two things. First of all... I have been laying groundwork all afternoon.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.200
Totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging, just:

07:23.280 --> 07:25.440
the theme of today is, "Ted rocks."

07:25.520 --> 07:27.200
And she's picking up what I'm laying down.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.400
- Lily, there's a problem...
- Wait, no.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.400
Thing number two: the dress.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.920
We got a dress.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.240
Go.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.640
Well?

07:38.200 --> 07:42.240
Did I bring it, or... did I bring it?

07:42.360 --> 07:43.680
I think I brought it.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.120
Wow.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.200
That's what I was going for.

07:48.680 --> 07:51.440
I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're going to have so much fun.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.200
Yeah, about that...

07:55.280 --> 07:57.040
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.200
So? The dress?

08:03.400 --> 08:05.120
I don't have a plus one for the wedding.

08:05.240 --> 08:05.880
What?

08:06.000 --> 08:09.040
I ran into Claudia, and she told me I didn't check "plus one" on the reply card.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.680
- Why didn't you check "plus..."?
- I did check "plus one."

08:11.840 --> 08:14.040
- But Robin is so excited.
- I know.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.320
-  And the dress!
- I know.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.960
Okay, okay. Well, we'll sneak her in.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.360
We can't sneak her in, we're not Ninjas.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.760
- Oh, I wish we were Ninjas.
- I know.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.880
You could always ask Stuart.

08:27.040 --> 08:27.840
Can I do that?

08:27.960 --> 08:28.800
Well,  sure.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.040
You guys have been friends for a long time.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.400
And it's 40% his wedding, too.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.640
I don't know... it's going to be a tough sell.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.559
Dude, no problem whatsoever.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.240
Really?

08:39.360 --> 08:40.880
Sure, the more, the merrier.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.360
Wow! Wow, thanks for being so cool about this,

08:43.480 --> 08:44.720
'cause you know, Claudia said...

08:44.800 --> 08:46.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This morning at the rehearsal,

08:46.360 --> 08:49.400
Claudia called our seven-year-old flower girl a whore.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.280
So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.960
Yeah, she's not usually like that.

08:54.080 --> 08:54.960
No.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.880
Well, thanks, Stu!

08:59.040 --> 09:00.960
It's going to be a great wedding.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.040
Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting

09:06.120 --> 09:08.560
to have non-traditional weddings out in the woods.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.320
Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods,

09:11.400 --> 09:13.080
like a couple of squirrels.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.680
Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.320
Like you could possibly know that.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.120
I did it. I did it-- I'm taking her to the wedding.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.000
Nice!

09:23.080 --> 09:23.840
What? How?

09:23.920 --> 09:25.000
I talked to Stuart.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.400
You went around the bride.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.920
"Oh, this hornets' nest looks harmless.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.040
Maybe I'll poke it with a stick.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.960
Oh, look, some Gremlins. Let me go feed them after midnight!"

09:35.080 --> 09:36.400
Did you know about this?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.080
It may have been my idea.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.480
What?

09:40.720 --> 09:42.400
Stuart doesn't get a say?

09:42.560 --> 09:45.520
Ah! So you admit it-- the groom should have an equal say.

09:45.640 --> 09:48.880
Well, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.960
So I can invite whoever I want?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.280
Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.400
It's Claudia.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.080
So it begins.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.640
Come on, it can't be that bad.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.800
Here, Lily, you answer it.

10:04.000 --> 10:04.880
What? Why?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.440
Because this whole thing was your idea.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.600
And... Claudia scares me.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.680
But... but you're the... But I just want to...

10:11.280 --> 10:12.280
Ted's phone.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.160
Oh, hi, Claudia.

10:15.080 --> 10:15.880
What?

10:16.080 --> 10:20.080
Now I wasn't there, but from what I heard, it went something like this...

10:20.320 --> 10:22.080
Oh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him

10:22.160 --> 10:23.760
he could bring his date to the wedding.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.280
You what?

10:28.400 --> 10:30.840
...always undermining me at every turn...

10:33.520 --> 10:35.840
...try to show a little flexibility, but no!

10:36.000 --> 10:37.280
It's all about you!

10:40.200 --> 10:41.880
...and your mother...

10:45.120 --> 10:46.160
You know what?

10:46.360 --> 10:47.520
The wedding's off!

10:50.560 --> 10:51.960
They broke up!

10:52.120 --> 10:53.000
O w!

10:54.920 --> 10:56.440
It's not because of me, is it?

10:56.960 --> 11:00.160
And my dad already paid for this huge wedding!

11:00.200 --> 11:02.040
Oh, he's going to kill me!

11:02.240 --> 11:03.840
And then he's gonna kill Ted!

11:04.000 --> 11:05.800
Then I'm gonna kill Ted.

11:06.000 --> 11:06.920
It's Robin.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.040
Answer it!

11:08.400 --> 11:09.400
Uh, Lily's phone.

11:09.520 --> 11:13.240
Ted, where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.160
Uh, Lily's busy.

11:15.280 --> 11:19.160
Oh, okay, well, I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's going to love them.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.360
That's great, I'll tell Lily to tell me.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.440
Uh, listen, I really want to keep talking, um, but now's not a good time,

11:24.560 --> 11:26.760
so I'm really excited about tomorrow, okay, bye.

11:26.760 --> 11:27.360
Okay, bye.

11:27.440 --> 11:31.280
Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.240
- Do you think she's into me?
- Ted, focus!

11:33.760 --> 11:36.520
Okay, okay, sweetie, just calm down.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.120
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?

11:38.240 --> 11:40.200
I want to go somewhere and drink!

11:40.320 --> 11:43.040
Okay, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.080
Oh, I feel terrible.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.440
Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.160
Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.720
Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.440
Um, tell Claudia I'm sorry.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.600
Did she seem pissed at me?

11:54.760 --> 11:59.080
She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.280
What say we get these crazy kids back together?

12:07.280 --> 12:08.760
Hi, sad eyes.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.600
What's got you down?

12:12.200 --> 12:14.920
Stuart and I just broke up.

12:15.280 --> 12:19.280
Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's...

12:19.400 --> 12:21.000
Two vodka cranberries, please.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.440
You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.720
Remember?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.320
When it comes to you, how can I forget?

12:30.840 --> 12:32.640
They all drink vodka cranberries.

12:34.080 --> 12:38.160
So... is there anything else you need... sweetie?

12:39.120 --> 12:41.240
You got $400,000?

12:41.400 --> 12:42.360
No.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.400
But I do have a hug.

12:49.760 --> 12:50.840
Thank you.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.680
Stuart, I-I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...

12:56.760 --> 12:59.360
Ted, for all I know, you did me the biggest favor anyone's ever done me.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.080
Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.360
No, I do-- this whole thing has made me realize I miss being single.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.520
I miss staying out late, and making messes and not cleaning them up.

13:07.640 --> 13:08.920
I miss owning porn.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.560
Dude, who doesn't?

13:10.880 --> 13:13.680
And you know, I'll see some super-hot model chick, and I'll think,

13:13.800 --> 13:16.400
"Why am I with Claudia? I could be with her."

13:16.480 --> 13:17.840
That's just crazy!

13:18.960 --> 13:21.600
I mean... you're the luckiest... You and Claudia both...

13:21.720 --> 13:24.120
The point is I want to get married. I want to settle down,

13:24.200 --> 13:25.840
but right now, that's just not who I am.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.840
I'm not a commitment guy; I'm a single guy.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.400
Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.880
Everybody feels this way sometimes.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.120
Relationships aren't easy; they're hard work.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.560
It's about compromise, growing together, all that Dr. Phil crap.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.120
How would you know? You're not even married.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.240
Okay, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.920
He's the pro-- this guy knows relationships.

13:45.000 --> 13:45.960
Tell him, Marshall.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.840
Stuart, don't get married.

13:49.000 --> 13:49.920
- Dude...
- What?

13:49.960 --> 13:51.040
Look, I'm sorry.

13:51.480 --> 13:56.120
Being in a couple is hard. And committing, making sacrifices, it's hard.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.800
But if it's the right person, then it's easy.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.320
Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life,

14:01.440 --> 14:04.520
that should be the easiest thing in the world, and if it's not like that,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.960
then she's not the one. I'm sorry.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.600
You  know I don't have $400,000, right?

14:16.280 --> 14:18.800
Maybe we got together too young.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.240
Maybe that's what the problem was.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.880
I mean, I'm 28 years old,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.400
and I've really only ever been with one man.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.280
That's just, that's...

14:32.400 --> 14:35.200
Two more vodka cranberries, please!

14:36.760 --> 14:40.400
Claudia... it's all gonna be okay.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.280
Oh, thanks for listening, Barney.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.600
It really means a lot to me.

14:47.320 --> 14:51.240
Isn't it weird that we should... run into each other like this?

14:51.680 --> 14:56.280
Two souls, of equal levels of attractiveness,

14:56.560 --> 15:02.400
both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.280
- Oh, hell, no!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

15:06.880 --> 15:09.160
Claudia is getting married tomorrow,

15:09.240 --> 15:13.400
and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her,

15:13.480 --> 15:16.200
I will take those peanuts you're trying to pass off as testicles,

15:16.280 --> 15:18.720
and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out,

15:18.800 --> 15:21.200
and then I'll feed them to you like grapes!

15:21.760 --> 15:23.640
Wait, my eyes or my testicles?

15:23.840 --> 15:24.960
One of each.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.120
All right! All right!

15:27.440 --> 15:28.360
Claudia?

15:29.200 --> 15:30.360
Stuart.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.520
I'm so sorry.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.880
I'm so sorry, too.

15:33.000 --> 15:33.920
I love you.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.400
I love you too, babe.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.200
Marshall and Ted set me straight.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.120
And when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize I...

15:40.200 --> 15:40.960
Marshall said what?!

15:41.040 --> 15:42.840
It's more complicated than that!

15:42.920 --> 15:44.320
He made me realize how much I love you.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.040
These guys got us back together.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.560
Okay, I'm cool, I'm cool.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.240
So where did we land on the whole plus one thing?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.400
No, no, no, no!

16:07.440 --> 16:10.480
It took three more vodka cranberries to subdue Claudia,

16:10.880 --> 16:14.200
but, eventually, she graciously agreed to let me bring Robin.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.440
Still wow.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.280
Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.320
Oh, yeah. I thought about leaving it at home,

16:24.400 --> 16:26.680
but I figured I don't want to get there and realize I need it

16:26.760 --> 16:30.440
and have to go all the way back to get it. So, yeah, I brought it.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.560
Oh, sorry.

16:35.640 --> 16:36.680
Hello?

16:38.440 --> 16:39.800
Oh, my God. Tonight?

16:39.920 --> 16:40.960
You're kidding.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.920
They want me to anchor the news tonight.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.480
Really?

16:44.720 --> 16:46.880
Like anchor anchor?

16:48.120 --> 16:50.160
What happened to Sandy?

16:50.400 --> 16:51.520
Okay.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.240
Okay. Sure. What time do you need me to...

16:54.320 --> 16:56.440
Right now?! Oh.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.480
Do it.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.560
Do it.

17:03.560 --> 17:08.280
Okay, I need like five minutes to change, and, um, I'll call you from the cab...

17:17.720 --> 17:18.800
So admit it.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.440
This wedding is both indoors and amazing.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.359
I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good.

17:25.480 --> 17:26.520
The crab puffs were incredible.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.240
We should totally have them at our wedding.

17:28.319 --> 17:29.240
Definitely...

17:29.840 --> 17:32.480
Hey. We just agreed on something.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.160
Did we just start planning our wedding?

17:35.240 --> 17:36.440
I think that we did.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.240
We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.840
Ooh, I thought the red sauce was, like, awesome.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.840
My God, were you born without taste buds?

17:47.840 --> 17:48.920
What?

17:49.880 --> 17:50.840
I love you.

17:57.320 --> 18:00.000
Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls?

18:00.120 --> 18:03.040
The answer may surprise you... after the break.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.840
Man, you know something? Stuart's my new hero.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.840
If that dude can bag a nine,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.560
I got to be able to bag, like, a 16.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.840
What's a 16?

18:19.200 --> 18:20.760
Those two eights right over there.

18:21.760 --> 18:22.600
Yeah.

18:23.760 --> 18:24.720
Hi, Ted.

18:24.840 --> 18:25.720
Claudia.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.920
We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.160
Yeah, where is she?

18:31.320 --> 18:34.880
Um... she couldn't make it.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.760
What's so funny?

18:38.880 --> 18:41.280
Oh, plan a wedding. You'll see.

18:45.760 --> 18:46.760
Look at that.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.560
That's how it's supposed to be. That right there.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.600
Easy, simple.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.160
It's just not like that with Robin.

18:54.760 --> 19:00.040
It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.

19:00.680 --> 19:05.320
Speaking of easy... bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.480
By the way, I almost forgot.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.080
We found this.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.920
I didn't check "plus one."

19:16.360 --> 19:17.400
You were right.

19:17.480 --> 19:18.880
Of course, I was right.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.680
I'm single.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.200
Maybe that's just who I am.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.440
And you know what? I like being single.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.280
Being single's the best.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.080
Yeah, stay out as late as you want.

19:29.160 --> 19:29.960
Answer to no one.

19:30.080 --> 19:32.480
The whole world full of endless possibilities.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.680
Never having to go to a farmer's market.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.640
Okay. Ah... doing some math here.

19:41.960 --> 19:45.480
Table six has got three bridesmaids: an eight, an eight, and a seven.

19:45.880 --> 19:50.480
I am willing to give you one of the eights, lowering myself to a 15,

19:50.560 --> 19:52.600
which means you owe me...

19:52.800 --> 19:57.600
So there we were, two single guys, doing our usual single-guy thing.

19:57.840 --> 20:02.080
For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point,

20:02.160 --> 20:06.360
that this was the night my life-- my real life-- would finally begin.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.200
The funny thing is...

20:08.440 --> 20:10.080
I wasn't totally wrong.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.880
Because that night was just beginning.
