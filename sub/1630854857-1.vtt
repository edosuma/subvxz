Look, I, I told kara she could
contact me if she needed me,

But I, I thought we agreed you
just tell her what you need

17:23.209 --> 17:24.358
To tell me, okay.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.527
So, kara's not there with you?

<i>Debra, why would she be with me?</i>

<i> She's missing, ron.</i>

Somebody...

<i> Oh god.</i>

No.

18:16.654 --> 18:18.096
Don't you think
she would tell you?

18:18.247 --> 18:21.006
She's answered your questions
multiple times, sir.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.342
Well, ma'am, we'll see if the
neighbors have anything to say.

18:23.494 --> 18:25.436
But chances are, your
girl is a runaway.

18:25.663 --> 18:28.589
My daughter is the
most responsible.
Ma'am.

18:28.608 --> 18:32.017
The idea that she would runaway
at all without her, her, her,

18:32.112 --> 18:34.261
Her purse, without her
clothes, without her shoes!

18:34.280 --> 18:36.172
Kids do dumb
things, ma'am.

18:36.190 --> 18:38.783
Even if she did runaway,
without a thing,

18:38.934 --> 18:43.529
Without telling another soul
in this world, she is 15!

18:43.681 --> 18:45.514
You need to find her.

18:45.533 --> 18:48.292
I'm sorry, I will
file this report.

18:48.519 --> 18:50.035
Officers will know
to be on the lookout.

18:50.188 --> 18:51.612
You should go home.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.964

19:53.676 --> 19:57.195
Yeah, for the most
part, I guess I did.

19:57.346 --> 19:59.755
It's easy when you're
a good student.

19:59.774 --> 20:02.366
I graduated early.

20:02.518 --> 20:04.535
Oh, you must be
really smart then.

20:04.687 --> 20:06.370
I like to think so.

20:10.601 --> 20:12.768
Did you, like, do
anything after, like,

20:12.861 --> 20:14.361
Did you go to
college or anything?

20:14.455 --> 20:16.622
No, too expensive.

20:16.774 --> 20:19.959
I had some part-time jobs
when I was in school,

20:20.111 --> 20:23.946
But nothing saved up.

20:23.965 --> 20:25.539
Actually, I
joined the navy.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.873
Oh, the navy.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.226
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, cool.

20:28.377 --> 20:30.636
Nine years.

20:30.788 --> 20:33.122
They wouldn't give me the
promotion I deserved,

20:33.215 --> 20:35.307
But they did give me
a bunch of medals and

20:35.401 --> 20:37.318
An honorable
discharge.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.365
That's impressive.

20:49.807 --> 20:53.476
You know I'm not
looking to hurt you.

20:53.494 --> 20:54.994
Not if you don't make me.

20:55.088 --> 20:58.330

22:55.616 --> 23:01.361
Now, kara, remember
there are rules.

23:01.455 --> 23:04.623
I think you're trying to do
something that you don't

23:04.717 --> 23:06.217
Have permission to do.

23:06.368 --> 23:08.869
Uh-uh.
Hmm.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.223
And when you break the rules,
there are consequences.

23:12.374 --> 23:17.186

23:22.068 --> 23:26.645
You were so good, kara, that
you have earned a reward.

Hmm.

24:07.338 --> 24:09.429
Probably clyde,

24:09.523 --> 24:11.190

Have you always
liked animals?

24:16.697 --> 24:20.516
I guess so, yeah.

24:20.609 --> 24:22.609
They're easy

24:27.950 --> 24:29.374
Do you work

24:29.527 --> 24:32.636
Now that you don't work
in the navy anymore?

24:32.863 --> 24:34.621
No.

I have a boring job.

Ma'am, I've got kids of my own,

was keeping her from it.

47:02.562 --> 47:05.880
(♪♪)

47:05.973 --> 47:08.065
I have a tough
thing to ask, kara.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.659
Do you think that if we
went back to the complex

47:09.886 --> 47:12.553
You'd be able to
pick out the apartment?

47:12.572 --> 47:15.556
Oh, I asked the people
in the car to remember

47:15.649 --> 47:17.316
What the apartment
number was.

47:17.410 --> 47:19.727
I asked them, and I'm sorry
to say they didn't remember.

47:19.745 --> 47:23.064
I think they were pretty
distracted by the sight of you.

47:23.082 --> 47:26.658
(♪♪)

47:26.678 --> 47:28.919
I don't think
I'm gonna remember.

47:29.072 --> 47:32.239
Kara, would you be up
to coming back with us

47:32.258 --> 47:33.741
To give it a
try anyway?

47:33.834 --> 47:38.262
(♪♪)

47:38.356 --> 47:40.264
<i> Get justice.</i>

47:40.358 --> 47:42.674
<i> Get him.</i>

47:42.694 --> 47:44.085
Yeah.

47:44.178 --> 47:47.346
(♪♪)

47:47.440 --> 47:48.606
<i>I think we're close.</i>

47:48.700 --> 47:52.184
(♪♪)

47:52.278 --> 47:53.427
<i>I think this is it.</i>

47:53.520 --> 48:01.526
(♪♪)

48:01.621 --> 48:03.045
Anything
looking familiar?

48:03.197 --> 48:05.364
(♪♪)

48:05.383 --> 48:14.281
Uh, yeah, I just...It
just looks the same.

48:14.375 --> 48:15.616
Maybe this guy
can help.

48:15.635 --> 48:21.622
(♪♪)

48:21.641 --> 48:22.714
Excuse me, sir.

48:22.734 --> 48:24.400
(car doors slam)

48:26.220 --> 48:27.478
Richland county
sheriffs.

48:27.630 --> 48:29.388
We're looking for the
apartment of a man here.

48:29.407 --> 48:33.075
Mid 30s, caucasian, brown
hair, about five foot nine.

48:33.227 --> 48:36.470
Uh, sorry, it's
a big complex.

48:36.489 --> 48:39.749
A lot of guys could be that,
especially if you include

48:39.976 --> 48:41.584
Boyfriends and
relatives, you know.

48:41.735 --> 48:43.252
Yeah, okay,
thank you.

48:44.647 --> 48:46.664
All of his windows
are covered up.

48:46.758 --> 48:49.833
He's got like a wolf curtain
kind of over his bed,

48:49.928 --> 48:52.744
And he lives with a lady
with long blond hair.

48:52.838 --> 48:54.838
I'm sorry, miss, I...
He also had a wall
full of animals.

48:54.933 --> 48:58.250
He had birds, rats, hermit
crabs, guinea pigs,

48:58.344 --> 48:59.418
That type of stuff.

48:59.512 --> 49:00.585
A lot of fish, too.

49:00.605 --> 49:03.755
Oh, yeah, that's
apartment 301, yeah, 301.

49:03.849 --> 49:06.183
Would you mind showing the
sergeant here to the leasing

49:06.277 --> 49:08.169
Office, so we can pull
the info on that unit?

49:08.187 --> 49:09.186
Yeah, sure.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.279
Thank you.

49:11.932 --> 49:13.357
Kara, let's
get you back.

49:13.451 --> 49:22.516
(♪♪)

49:22.535 --> 49:24.018
That's great work.

49:24.036 --> 49:35.379
(♪♪)

49:35.531 --> 49:36.880
This is
lieutenant rowland,

49:36.975 --> 49:40.551
I need a car watching 1532
slaw street, apartment 301.

49:40.703 --> 49:43.462
Suspect is considered
armed and dangerous.

49:43.481 --> 49:46.390
Sergeant jennings is
watching the scene.

49:46.542 --> 49:48.150
<i> Radio: Copy that lieutenant.</i>

49:48.377 --> 49:50.302
<i> We'll put an all points</i>
<i> bulletin asap.</i>

49:50.396 --> 49:52.137
<i> Officer please respond.</i>

49:52.156 --> 49:53.547
<i> Officers please-</i>

49:53.566 --> 49:54.715
(♪♪)

49:54.808 --> 49:57.384
Kara, where is she?
Ma'am?

49:57.478 --> 49:59.662
Kara robinson.
Mrs. Johnson.

49:59.813 --> 50:01.813
Yes, you called me.

50:01.833 --> 50:03.724
You called me to tell
me that she's here.

50:03.743 --> 50:05.409
What and,
and she's not?

50:05.503 --> 50:06.651
I don't know, I-

50:06.671 --> 50:08.245
What do you mean
you don't know?

50:08.397 --> 50:09.913
Where the hell
is my daughter?!

50:10.066 --> 50:11.732
Momma.

50:11.751 --> 50:15.085
(♪♪)

50:15.238 --> 50:17.179
(♪♪)
(sobbing)

50:17.406 --> 50:18.681
Oh, my baby.

50:18.832 --> 50:24.353
(♪♪)
(sobbing)

50:28.192 --> 50:29.358
What's the word?

50:29.510 --> 50:30.675
No activity in the unit
since patrol showed up,

50:30.695 --> 50:32.528
And none of the neighbors
witnessed him leaving.

50:32.755 --> 50:34.104
Could be holed up,
waiting for us.

50:34.198 --> 50:35.680
Could be.

50:35.700 --> 50:37.591
Let's go see.

50:37.610 --> 50:41.779
(♪♪)

50:41.873 --> 50:43.188
(knocking)

50:43.207 --> 50:45.708
Police!

50:45.859 --> 50:47.268
Can I have the keys?

50:47.286 --> 50:55.700
(♪♪)

50:55.720 --> 50:56.794
Clear!

50:56.888 --> 51:05.043
(♪♪)

51:05.063 --> 51:06.470
Clear!

51:06.564 --> 51:12.717
(♪♪)

51:12.737 --> 51:13.977
Clear!

51:14.072 --> 51:15.554
(♪♪)

51:15.648 --> 51:17.464
Clear!
<i> Clear!</i>

51:17.483 --> 51:18.649
(♪♪)

51:18.743 --> 51:20.392
All clear.

51:20.486 --> 51:21.635
This is the
right spot.

51:21.654 --> 51:26.323
(♪♪)

51:26.417 --> 51:27.641
She was spot on.

51:27.734 --> 51:37.484
(♪♪)

51:37.578 --> 51:39.320
Jennings.
I'll get the
bolo out.

51:39.413 --> 51:40.337
And get kara
to make that id.

51:40.431 --> 51:41.764
Yes, sir.

51:41.915 --> 51:43.748
Do a sweep
of the area.

51:43.843 --> 51:46.251
Surrounding buildings, parking
lots, any suspicious man.

51:46.345 --> 51:48.679
Get the technicians here.

51:48.773 --> 51:50.514
You'll have those additional
search warrants asap.

51:50.608 --> 51:51.498
Yes, sir.

51:51.517 --> 51:56.687
(♪♪)

51:56.839 --> 51:59.840
Can't believe they
have kept us waiting.

51:59.933 --> 52:02.284
I'm going to get
you something.

52:05.456 --> 52:07.014
I'm fine.

52:07.107 --> 52:09.850
No, I'm going to say something
and I'm going to get them to-

52:09.943 --> 52:13.612
No, please just
stop, please.

52:13.631 --> 52:15.522
Are you hungry?

52:15.541 --> 52:16.707
Are you, are
you thirsty?

52:16.801 --> 52:17.541
Are you...

52:17.635 --> 52:19.193
<i>Miss johnson.</i>

52:19.286 --> 52:20.527
Hi there.
We haven't met yet.

52:20.546 --> 52:22.212
I am sergeant jennings.

52:22.306 --> 52:25.474
I'd like to give you some
pictures to look at and

52:25.626 --> 52:27.551
See if your
kidnapper's in there.

52:27.703 --> 52:29.370
If you're up for it.
Yeah, of course.

52:29.463 --> 52:39.062
(♪♪)

52:39.157 --> 52:40.214
Number four.

52:40.232 --> 52:41.715
You're sure?
Number four.

52:41.734 --> 52:47.329
(♪♪)

52:47.481 --> 52:50.557
That's the man that is leasing
the apartment that you were in.

52:50.651 --> 52:52.334
Um, his name is
richard marc evonitz.

52:52.486 --> 52:54.986
Unfortunately, he was gone
by the time we got there.

52:55.006 --> 52:56.747
Are you saying he's
still out there?
<i> Mom.</i>

52:56.841 --> 52:58.507
We've got everyone out
there looking for him.

52:58.659 --> 53:00.067
He's not
gonna get far.

53:00.160 --> 53:04.571
Oh, well, everyone's looking
out for him, that's reassuring.

53:04.590 --> 53:06.423
Kara, if there is anything
that you think you might know,

53:06.517 --> 53:08.517
Or any information that you have
that might help us figure out

53:08.669 --> 53:10.427
Where evonitz is going.

53:10.521 --> 53:13.355
Yeah, he was honorably
discharged from the navy

53:13.507 --> 53:15.173
At least a couple
of years ago.

53:15.193 --> 53:17.842
And the gray
parakeet that he has,

53:17.862 --> 53:21.438
Actually I think it's a
cockatiel, um, his name's clyde,

53:21.532 --> 53:24.015
And he's had it longer
than any of his other pets.

53:24.109 --> 53:27.352
Uh, the woman that he lives with
is probably in disney world

53:27.446 --> 53:29.763
Right now with somebody else,
so he's got to go back to work

53:29.782 --> 53:33.450
Tomorrow, something to do
with, like, air compressors.

53:33.602 --> 53:36.453
Family doctors
name is dr. Reitz,

53:36.547 --> 53:42.218
And the phone number for
that is 803-555-6714,

53:42.445 --> 53:44.611
And he's a got a
history of anxiety,

53:44.630 --> 53:47.539
And he's got a dentist as well
whose name is dr. Greg nublin

53:47.633 --> 53:56.807
And the number for that is
803-555-8562, 803-555-856, yeah.

53:56.901 --> 53:59.643
There's a box, a big box, too,
underneath all of his animal

53:59.737 --> 54:01.645
Cages that he did not
want me to know about,

54:01.739 --> 54:04.073
So you should probably
find whatever that is,

54:04.224 --> 54:05.299
You should find that.

54:05.392 --> 54:07.892
We will.
Be sure to do that.

54:07.912 --> 54:10.654
In fact, would you mind
calling that all in right now?

54:10.748 --> 54:13.490
Thank you.

54:13.584 --> 54:16.660
While the detective is
updating lieutenant rowland,

54:16.754 --> 54:19.070
I'd like to talk through
some of what comes next.

54:19.090 --> 54:20.497
Okay.

54:20.591 --> 54:22.332
Two specially trained
nurses are gonna come in,

54:22.485 --> 54:24.242
They're gonna
collect your clothes,

54:24.262 --> 54:26.745
And any other relevant
evidence, you know.

54:26.764 --> 54:28.931
First thing we have to do is
we have to ask you some more

54:29.158 --> 54:30.841
Detailed questions about
what happened.

54:30.935 --> 54:31.658
Okay.
Okay?

54:31.752 --> 54:35.996
(♪♪)

54:36.015 --> 54:39.090
Mom, could you go outside
for this part, do you think?

54:39.184 --> 54:41.926
Uh, of course, baby.

54:41.946 --> 54:45.355
I'll just be in the hallway
if you need anything.

54:45.449 --> 54:53.605
(♪♪)

54:53.699 --> 54:55.774
Okay, kara, you ready?

54:55.793 --> 54:57.351
Yeah.

54:57.369 --> 55:01.371
(♪♪)

55:01.465 --> 55:04.300
Sir, what's in here
just keeps getting worse.

55:04.451 --> 55:05.617
And no sign of evonitz.

55:05.636 --> 55:07.528
No, sir.

55:07.546 --> 55:10.306
Did find a vehicle registered
in his name, a taurus,

55:10.457 --> 55:12.199
Not the trans am.

55:12.217 --> 55:14.977
Bolo's been updated with
kara's id, but no hits yet.

55:16.797 --> 55:18.480
Let's damn well hope whatever
he's hiding in his foot locker

55:18.632 --> 55:19.982
Is something useful.

55:21.468 --> 55:22.726
We have bolt
cutters in here.

55:22.820 --> 55:32.719
(♪♪)

55:32.813 --> 55:34.237
Gonna need some
evidence bags.

55:34.332 --> 55:36.481
(♪♪)

55:36.500 --> 55:39.560
That's the outfit that
kara described him wearing.

55:39.578 --> 55:43.505
(♪♪)

55:43.732 --> 55:45.156
Those aren't?

55:45.250 --> 55:48.251
No, no, they're
not kara's.

55:48.346 --> 56:12.868
(♪♪)

56:13.019 --> 56:16.279
Officer, you get me everything
you can find on these cases,

56:16.374 --> 56:18.615
And the number to the
spotsylvania county sheriff.

56:18.709 --> 56:21.543
(♪♪)

56:21.695 --> 56:23.212
Those notes
decipherable?

56:23.439 --> 56:27.049
Some, these, these
might be directions.

56:27.200 --> 56:29.385
Figure it out,
lieutenant.

56:29.536 --> 56:32.446
Use whatever you need, and
find this son of a bitch.

56:32.464 --> 56:35.949
(♪♪)

56:35.968 --> 56:37.968
Have you ever been to
a gynecologist, honey?

56:38.120 --> 56:39.620
No.

56:39.638 --> 56:41.455
Okay, the next thing that
we need to do here is

56:41.548 --> 56:43.807
A pelvic exam,
all right?

56:43.901 --> 56:45.567
Okay, all right.

56:45.794 --> 56:47.628
If you could just
scooch forward,

56:47.721 --> 56:50.647
Lie down and raise
your knees.

56:50.741 --> 57:00.249
(♪♪)

57:00.400 --> 57:03.085
Okay, here we go.

57:03.236 --> 57:04.645
<i> Get through this.</i>

57:04.663 --> 57:06.329
(♪♪)

57:06.424 --> 57:08.148
<i> Get justice.</i>

57:08.167 --> 57:09.049
(♪♪)

57:13.097 --> 57:18.325
(♪♪)

57:18.418 --> 57:20.677
Please take this,
he's dangerous.

57:20.771 --> 57:24.756
(♪♪)

57:24.850 --> 57:27.684
Seen this man?
No, no.

57:27.778 --> 57:28.777
(♪♪)

57:29.004 --> 57:32.172
No. But, okay, I'm
gonna put this up back.

57:32.265 --> 57:33.356
(♪♪)

57:33.451 --> 57:34.450
Okay, perfect.

57:34.601 --> 57:38.770
(♪♪)

57:38.789 --> 57:40.772
<i>Have you had any</i>
<i>updates from your people?</i>

57:40.791 --> 57:42.774
Nobody's seen head
or tail of this guy.

57:42.868 --> 57:45.202
I heard you want
with the feds.

57:45.296 --> 57:46.853
They got a lead?

57:46.872 --> 57:49.614
No. What we do have is more
information from the fbi

57:49.633 --> 57:53.284
And the silva/lisk task force
on the spotsylvania cases.

57:53.304 --> 57:56.379
Sophia sylva, age 16,
was snatched off her

57:56.474 --> 57:58.365
Own front porch.

57:58.458 --> 58:00.809
The police worked
it as a runaway.

58:01.036 --> 58:03.312
The body wasn't found
'til months later.

58:03.463 --> 58:05.706
We put the wrong guy away for it
in an uproar to bring justice

58:05.724 --> 58:09.968
To the girl, and not even a
year later two other girls,

58:10.062 --> 58:13.137
12 and 15-year-old sisters are
grabbed from their front yard.

58:13.157 --> 58:16.474
This man holds these
children for days,

58:16.494 --> 58:19.219
Then he drowns them in his
bathtub and dumps their bodies

58:19.238 --> 58:20.829
In the swamp.

58:20.981 --> 58:24.725
That task force has been working
those cases for five years.

58:24.743 --> 58:27.151
I'm not gonna say it's evonitz
before the evidence is in.

58:27.246 --> 58:28.578
Hell, I'll say it.

58:28.672 --> 58:32.323
Evonitz is a serial
killer of little girls.

58:32.417 --> 58:34.918
The papers in the foot locker
were mostly full of stalking

58:35.070 --> 58:38.238
Notes, potential victims
from the looks of it.

58:38.257 --> 58:40.164
But we've been able to track
down all the most recent

58:40.259 --> 58:42.518
Targets, they're okay.

58:42.745 --> 58:44.168
Was the robinson
girl in those notes?

58:44.263 --> 58:46.596
Kara, no she wasn't.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.524
The girl we think it was meant
to be went to a friend's

58:48.675 --> 58:50.751
Instead of walking home.

58:50.844 --> 58:53.587
That makes you think about what
other cases could be out there.

58:53.680 --> 58:56.698
You put some of
my guys on that.

58:56.850 --> 59:00.610
I mean there's no way evonitz
started with those murders.

59:00.704 --> 59:03.764
Sheriff, sheriff, we've
gotten hold of the woman

59:03.857 --> 59:05.040
With the long
blond hair.

59:05.191 --> 59:07.692
Evonitz's wife, ashley.

59:07.711 --> 59:10.620
She and evonitz's mother
are exactly where kara said,

59:10.714 --> 59:12.289
Disney world.

59:12.441 --> 59:13.623
They're headed
back to cooperate.

59:13.717 --> 59:15.366
Well that's good news.

59:15.386 --> 59:18.295
We've also got the mother's
okay to search her house.

59:18.389 --> 59:21.205
And one of the sisters is
coming in tomorrow to answer

59:21.300 --> 59:22.783
Some questions, too.

59:22.801 --> 59:25.635
I only pray that she's got
something worth telling.

59:25.729 --> 59:28.379
(♪♪)

59:28.399 --> 59:29.790
You and me both.

59:29.808 --> 59:35.462
(♪♪)

59:35.480 --> 59:36.697
Kara.
Kara.

59:39.243 --> 59:40.200
Hey.

59:43.989 --> 59:47.808
Hey, that's okay, it's not your
fault, jess, it's not your.

59:47.826 --> 59:57.484
(♪♪)

59:57.502 --> 59:59.319
Oh, sweetheart.

59:59.338 --> 1:00:00.487
I want to go home.

1:00:00.505 --> 1:00:07.418
(♪♪)

1:00:07.438 --> 1:00:08.729
Are you okay?

1:00:14.427 --> 1:00:16.503
Can you tell me
what happened?

1:00:16.521 --> 1:00:18.429
Where were you?

1:00:18.523 --> 1:00:19.615
Do you know where
you were?

1:00:19.842 --> 1:00:22.192
Can you stop asking
questions, please stop.

1:00:22.344 --> 1:00:25.603
Kara, honey, I, I
just, you can tell me,

1:00:25.697 --> 1:00:27.289
You can tell
me anything.

1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:28.624
I want you
to tell me.

1:00:33.372 --> 1:00:39.542
You don't want to know,
so just...Just don't ask

1:00:39.695 --> 1:00:41.211
If you don't want to
know the answer.

1:00:41.305 --> 1:00:55.392
(♪♪)

1:00:55.544 --> 1:00:56.968
Any sign of him?
Not a one.

1:00:57.062 --> 1:00:58.545
Seems like he just came by
to drop his momma's car off

1:00:58.563 --> 1:01:00.304
And take her other one.

1:01:00.324 --> 1:01:02.640
I've updated the bolo, but
he's switched cars once,

1:01:02.734 --> 1:01:03.808
I'm sure he's
done it again.

1:01:03.902 --> 1:01:05.385
No, you're
likely right.

1:01:05.404 --> 1:01:06.644
Fbi's on its way out to take
control of the evidence

1:01:06.738 --> 1:01:08.664
Collection themselves.

1:01:08.815 --> 1:01:10.999
I wouldn't be surprised if they
just end up shipping the thing

1:01:11.151 --> 1:01:12.559
Straight to quantico.

1:01:12.577 --> 1:01:13.743
That thing's gonna have
some evidence of those

1:01:13.896 --> 1:01:15.837
Virginia girls,
I'd put money on it.

1:01:16.064 --> 1:01:18.173
Maybe we'll find some
stash of his in the house.

1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:19.916
Maybe.

1:01:20.010 --> 1:01:21.510
It's hard to take comfort
in closing cold cases when

1:01:21.737 --> 1:01:23.345
He's still out there
to make new ones.

1:01:25.407 --> 1:01:27.498
Listen, I'll stay here
and wait for the feds.

1:01:27.518 --> 1:01:30.260
I want you to go and
check in with kara.

1:01:30.354 --> 1:01:31.669
She should know where
we're at with the search.

1:01:31.689 --> 1:01:33.580
Okay.

1:01:33.598 --> 1:01:45.759
(♪♪)

1:01:45.777 --> 1:01:47.685
(doorbell chimes)

1:01:47.705 --> 1:01:49.520
Oh, hey.

1:01:49.540 --> 1:01:51.097
Hello.

1:01:51.116 --> 1:01:52.541
Come on in.

1:01:53.936 --> 1:01:56.027
Hey, thank you so
much for coming over.

1:01:56.121 --> 1:01:57.938
This means a lot.

1:01:58.031 --> 1:01:59.214
My mom's just,
like, in the kitchen

1:01:59.365 --> 1:02:00.698
If you're
looking for her.

1:02:00.718 --> 1:02:02.050
Okay.

1:02:04.796 --> 1:02:06.613
Hey, kara, you're a tough
girl to get an audience with.

1:02:06.706 --> 1:02:08.448
I can't do
this anymore.

1:02:08.467 --> 1:02:10.684
Okay, come on.

1:02:13.897 --> 1:02:14.730
(door closes)

1:02:16.641 --> 1:02:18.124
How can I help?

1:02:18.218 --> 1:02:19.735
Why are the
police still here?

1:02:19.886 --> 1:02:21.311
Like, what's
going on?

1:02:21.405 --> 1:02:22.812
Some of the officers are
here for your protection

1:02:22.906 --> 1:02:24.889
Because we don't know
where evonitz is yet.

1:02:24.908 --> 1:02:27.650
We just need to take
that extra precaution.

1:02:27.745 --> 1:02:30.303
There are a lot of officers
across both counties,

1:02:30.322 --> 1:02:32.396
And now the fbi involved.

1:02:32.416 --> 1:02:35.308
So, sometimes they
might be showing up here

1:02:35.401 --> 1:02:37.568
For information,
or updates.

1:02:37.588 --> 1:02:41.256
But the final reason
is understanding.

1:02:41.407 --> 1:02:43.817
You know, they all know you
escaped something on your own,

1:02:43.835 --> 1:02:49.747
So they're impressed, or
curious, or just concerned.

1:02:49.841 --> 1:02:53.268
It's the same reason why you see
people here who you've never

1:02:53.419 --> 1:02:56.162
Seen in this house before today
just showing up with apologies

1:02:56.181 --> 1:02:58.498
And pecan bars.

1:02:58.517 --> 1:03:00.667
But I don't want that, I
don't want any of this.

1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:02.611
I can certainly
understand that.

1:03:02.762 --> 1:03:04.687
That is not
fair to you.

1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:07.115
You have every
right to be angry.

1:03:07.342 --> 1:03:09.526
But it just comes
down to people caring.

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:14.605
(♪♪)

1:03:14.699 --> 1:03:17.867
Thank you, sergeant.

1:03:17.961 --> 1:03:21.630
I think I'm just gonna go
lie down for a little bit.

1:03:21.781 --> 1:03:22.964
That's not a bad idea.

1:03:23.191 --> 1:03:24.299
Okay.

1:03:24.450 --> 1:03:25.467
(♪♪)

1:03:25.694 --> 1:03:27.135
And then maybe you'll
catch him tomorrow and

1:03:27.362 --> 1:03:28.786
Everything will
go back to normal.

1:03:28.806 --> 1:03:30.788
Maybe.

1:03:30.808 --> 1:03:33.308
Might take a little while
longer than tomorrow, kara.

1:03:33.535 --> 1:03:35.535
But sleep is always
a good start.

1:03:35.554 --> 1:03:40.607
(♪♪)

1:03:44.655 --> 1:04:05.415
(♪♪)

1:04:05.509 --> 1:04:07.584
I think I'm gonna go over
to ryan's after breakfast.

1:04:07.736 --> 1:04:10.494
You're not
going anywhere.

1:04:10.514 --> 1:04:13.256
They still haven't caught
that horrible man, and,

1:04:13.350 --> 1:04:15.742
And they're here to keep watch
'cause he could be out there

1:04:15.835 --> 1:04:17.853
Looking for you,
anybody could.

1:04:18.004 --> 1:04:19.688
I was allowed to go to ryan's
whenever I wanted without

1:04:19.839 --> 1:04:21.356
Asking you, like,
two days ago.

1:04:21.507 --> 1:04:22.749
That was two
days ago.

1:04:22.767 --> 1:04:23.933
What's
different now?

1:04:24.086 --> 1:04:25.843
Kara.
No for real, what's
different now?

1:04:25.937 --> 1:04:28.512
I don't need
protecting.

1:04:28.607 --> 1:04:30.607
I got back here all by myself,
I'm not gonna stop acting

1:04:30.701 --> 1:04:32.850
The way that I used to act
because of all of this.

1:04:32.944 --> 1:04:38.189
This isn't my life.

1:04:38.208 --> 1:04:40.450
It's just something
that happened.

1:04:40.544 --> 1:04:42.435
(knocking)

1:04:42.528 --> 1:04:43.786
No, we're not done
discussing this.

1:04:43.939 --> 1:04:45.380
You are not
leaving this house.

1:04:47.275 --> 1:04:48.550
Is it, is it
okay that I came?

1:04:48.777 --> 1:04:50.051
Yeah, I'm so glad
you're here right now.

1:04:51.296 --> 1:04:52.295
Let's go to my room.

1:04:52.389 --> 1:04:59.543
(♪♪)

1:04:59.563 --> 1:05:00.711
Do you want to do our
nails or something?

1:05:00.805 --> 1:05:02.397
I can get my
nail polish.

1:05:03.716 --> 1:05:07.027
Uh, yeah, whatever
you want to do.

1:05:11.241 --> 1:05:13.650
Just ask.

1:05:13.744 --> 1:05:15.802
Ask what?

1:05:15.895 --> 1:05:17.579
Just ask what you
really want to ask.

1:05:19.732 --> 1:05:22.475
No.

1:05:22.568 --> 1:05:25.069
No, I just
wanted to see you.

1:05:25.163 --> 1:05:27.589
To see if
you were okay.

1:05:27.740 --> 1:05:31.668
As, as okay
as you can be.

1:05:31.762 --> 1:05:33.653
I'm okay.

1:05:33.672 --> 1:05:35.505
Really, I'm okay.

1:05:35.599 --> 1:05:37.674
Just ask.

1:05:37.768 --> 1:05:43.104
(♪♪)

1:05:43.331 --> 1:05:44.681
What happened?

1:05:44.775 --> 1:05:50.445
(♪♪)

1:05:50.596 --> 1:05:51.780
A man pulled
into the driveway.

1:05:55.010 --> 1:05:57.527
He sent me to disney
because he's a good man.

1:05:57.679 --> 1:05:59.788
Marc couldn't have
done all that.

1:05:59.939 --> 1:06:04.200
I'm sorry to say he did, ashley,
and if we can't track him down,

1:06:04.352 --> 1:06:06.795
He might do
something else.

1:06:07.022 --> 1:06:09.613
So, do you have any idea
where your husband might be?

1:06:09.633 --> 1:06:11.299
No.

1:06:11.526 --> 1:06:14.469
He says he's happiest
when he's with me.

1:06:14.620 --> 1:06:17.621
If he's not
at his mom's.

1:06:17.641 --> 1:06:19.957
He hasn't tried to call
you or contact you at all?

1:06:19.977 --> 1:06:22.035
No.

1:06:22.053 --> 1:06:27.298
But he loves me no matter what,
and I love him no matter what.

1:06:27.317 --> 1:06:29.317
Okay.

1:06:30.803 --> 1:06:34.656
(ambient street noise)

1:06:35.325 --> 1:06:36.658
Hi mama.

1:06:36.809 --> 1:06:39.310
Hi ashley.
Stephanie?

1:06:39.329 --> 1:06:41.329
Hi.

1:06:41.481 --> 1:06:45.316
I'm sure they just called her
in like they did us, honey.

1:06:45.335 --> 1:06:48.819
From what I know
he's in ashley's car,

1:06:48.839 --> 1:06:52.674
But he told me he
switched the plates.

1:06:52.901 --> 1:06:56.402
They were still south
carolina, I think.

1:06:56.421 --> 1:06:59.906
(♪♪)

1:06:59.924 --> 1:07:05.428
He's probably gonna find a way
to contact one of us soon.

1:07:05.522 --> 1:07:07.747
He's trying to find a
way to get ashley to him.

1:07:07.766 --> 1:07:19.592
(♪♪)

1:07:19.611 --> 1:07:25.448
I have a feeling that this
is not the first time marc

1:07:25.542 --> 1:07:28.101
Has done something like
this with a young girl.

1:07:28.119 --> 1:07:31.604
(♪♪)

1:07:31.623 --> 1:07:34.215
Finding out the brother you care
about isn't who you thought is a

1:07:34.367 --> 1:07:39.128
Tough thing, stephanie, but you
have done good talking to me.

1:07:39.222 --> 1:07:46.728
(♪♪)

1:07:46.955 --> 1:07:50.123
Marc contacted me
yesterday afternoon.

1:07:50.216 --> 1:07:54.143
(♪♪)

1:07:54.237 --> 1:07:55.403
I'm sorry.

1:07:56.981 --> 1:07:59.890
Sheriff, evonitz is at this
motel outside of orangeburg.

1:07:59.984 --> 1:08:02.485
The room is under his sister's
name, stephanie newell.

1:08:02.637 --> 1:08:03.803
She hasn't talked
to him since.

1:08:03.896 --> 1:08:05.062
He should
still be there.

1:08:05.156 --> 1:08:06.472
Not check out yet.

1:08:06.566 --> 1:08:07.657
Jennings, get
down there.

1:08:07.751 --> 1:08:09.400
I'll get orangeburg sheriff
to send a team asap.

1:08:09.419 --> 1:08:10.493
Copy.

1:08:10.587 --> 1:08:16.257
(♪♪)

1:08:21.506 --> 1:08:23.747
Oh, just
ignore them.

1:08:23.842 --> 1:08:30.830
(chatter on police radio)

1:08:30.923 --> 1:08:32.107
So you're still gonna
come and pick me up

1:08:32.258 --> 1:08:34.183
Later for the
game, right?

1:08:34.277 --> 1:08:36.277
Um, yeah.

1:08:36.504 --> 1:08:39.280
Okay.
Of course,
same as always.

1:08:48.458 --> 1:08:49.791
(car door slams)

1:08:53.204 --> 1:08:55.188
Well hello there.

1:08:55.281 --> 1:08:57.373
I'm here to talk
to your mom.

1:08:57.525 --> 1:09:00.209
Sheriff stevens,
lexington county.
Right on, yeah,
she's inside.

1:09:00.303 --> 1:09:03.138
Hmm, how are
you doing?

1:09:04.549 --> 1:09:06.474
Good, I'm fine.

1:09:07.978 --> 1:09:09.477
You've been through a hell
of an ordeal, young lady.

1:09:09.629 --> 1:09:12.313
You've been victimized.

1:09:12.540 --> 1:09:15.466
You ought to take
some time to recover.

1:09:15.485 --> 1:09:17.134
You really shouldn't be out
and about when we haven't

1:09:17.228 --> 1:09:19.154
Caught your attacker yet.

1:09:19.381 --> 1:09:20.971
Maybe you should get
out there and catch him.

1:09:20.991 --> 1:09:23.383
You certainly didn't help
me the first time around.

1:09:23.401 --> 1:09:29.146
(♪♪)

1:09:29.166 --> 1:09:32.074
You know that guy was
gonna kill you, right?

1:09:32.169 --> 1:09:36.487
And all things said, you
should be dead right now.

1:09:36.506 --> 1:09:40.082
He's likely killed
at least three girls.

1:09:40.177 --> 1:09:42.993
Now the evidence hasn't
come in yet, but it will.

1:09:43.013 --> 1:09:47.240
You should thank your lucky
stars that you weren't next.

1:09:47.333 --> 1:09:50.243
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

1:09:50.261 --> 1:09:53.521
(♪♪)

1:09:58.028 --> 1:09:59.085
Well, evonitz
wasn't at the motel,

1:09:59.103 --> 1:10:00.361
But it looks like
he left in a hurry.

1:10:00.513 --> 1:10:01.512
The shirt kara was wearing
when he took her is here,

1:10:01.531 --> 1:10:03.606
And some of his
clothes, too.

1:10:03.758 --> 1:10:06.201
Orangeburg's agreed to keep
surveillance on the room in case

1:10:06.428 --> 1:10:08.870
He comes back, but I think
he's probably on the move.

1:10:09.097 --> 1:10:11.264
Okay, make sure that
evidence gets where it ought

1:10:11.282 --> 1:10:12.707
And come on back.

1:10:12.934 --> 1:10:14.191
One of the family
tipped him off.

1:10:14.211 --> 1:10:16.360
Probably, but at least we
know for sure he's running,

1:10:16.379 --> 1:10:19.272
Not stalking kara or
some other girl, running.

1:10:19.290 --> 1:10:20.531
Yeah, at least for now.

1:10:20.550 --> 1:10:21.958
At least for now.

1:10:22.110 --> 1:10:23.943
The fbi sent the prelims on
the fibres from the handcuffs,

1:10:23.962 --> 1:10:25.795
It's looking like a match
to the fibres found on

1:10:25.889 --> 1:10:28.448
All three bodies, and
there's a full palm print

1:10:28.541 --> 1:10:29.873
On the inside
of the trunk.

1:10:29.893 --> 1:10:31.375
Between that and his
sister's statement.

1:10:31.394 --> 1:10:32.802
I know.

1:10:32.896 --> 1:10:35.546
An entirely off the radar
serial killer done in by his

1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:38.307
Intended victim,
it's incredible.

1:10:38.401 --> 1:10:45.648
(♪♪)

1:10:45.742 --> 1:10:48.243
Hello kara.

1:10:48.470 --> 1:10:51.562
Jim price, sheriff
for richland country.

1:10:51.581 --> 1:10:53.248
Are you gonna tell me
to stay inside, too,

1:10:53.475 --> 1:10:55.583
Because you haven't done
your job yet and my attacker

1:10:55.735 --> 1:10:57.660
Is a serial killer?

1:10:57.754 --> 1:11:00.571
I'd never presume to tell
you what to do, kara.

1:11:00.665 --> 1:11:05.426
Even if I thought evonitz was
a threat to you, and I don't.

1:11:17.999 --> 1:11:20.333
I won't ask who told
you about our suspicions

1:11:20.351 --> 1:11:22.926
Since it
doesn't matter.

1:11:23.021 --> 1:11:27.282
What does matter is what you
know and what you want to know.

1:11:27.433 --> 1:11:29.842
Did he kill
those three girls?

1:11:29.935 --> 1:11:32.678
We can't say
for certain yet.

1:11:32.697 --> 1:11:35.439
What we know was in the foot
locker you pointed out,

1:11:35.533 --> 1:11:38.367
Were articles discussing the
disappearance and murder of

1:11:38.461 --> 1:11:41.521
Three girls around your age
from about five years ago.

1:11:41.539 --> 1:11:43.280
Why would he have those
if he didn't kill them?

1:11:43.374 --> 1:11:45.875
That's a good question, but
someone was wrongly accused for

1:11:45.969 --> 1:11:49.695
The first girl's murder,
which is why I make it a point

1:11:49.714 --> 1:11:52.365
To wait on
the evidence.

1:11:52.458 --> 1:11:55.626
Would he have
killed me?

1:11:55.645 --> 1:11:58.629
I can't say that.

1:11:58.723 --> 1:12:02.984
But even if he wanted to, you
didn't give him the chance.

1:12:06.823 --> 1:12:10.491
So, the reason I
came looking for you.

1:12:10.718 --> 1:12:14.387
I needed to come and say
thank you for the incredible

1:12:14.405 --> 1:12:17.239
Thing you've done.

1:12:17.334 --> 1:12:20.484
Some people will try to
tell you you're a victim,

1:12:20.578 --> 1:12:24.339
But you really
are is a survivor,

1:12:24.490 --> 1:12:29.827
One with a kind of strength and
grace that's rare in this world.

1:12:29.921 --> 1:12:34.757
We may not have your captor yet,
but we're going to get him.

1:12:34.851 --> 1:12:38.744
And when we do, it will
be because of you, kara.

1:12:38.763 --> 1:12:41.414
Thank you.

1:12:41.507 --> 1:12:45.101
You're welcome,
I guess.

1:12:45.195 --> 1:12:49.697
(♪♪)

1:12:49.924 --> 1:12:52.349
You let me know if there's
anything I can do for you.

1:12:52.443 --> 1:12:53.943
And if you
wouldn't mind,

1:12:54.037 --> 1:12:56.445
I'd love to come by and
see you sometime again.

1:12:56.598 --> 1:12:59.281
See you around
then, sheriff.

1:12:59.376 --> 1:13:05.605
(♪♪)

1:13:05.623 --> 1:13:06.622
(phone ringing)

1:13:06.716 --> 1:13:08.274
Sheriff price.

1:13:08.292 --> 1:13:09.775
Evonitz used his cell
phone about 15 minutes ago

1:13:09.869 --> 1:13:11.869
Just outside of
jacksonville, florida.

1:13:11.963 --> 1:13:14.447
Now, we're guessing he's headed
to see his other sister.

1:13:14.465 --> 1:13:16.282
She's about three hours
further south in bradenton.

1:13:16.300 --> 1:13:17.708
Okay, this is it.

1:13:17.727 --> 1:13:19.118
You make sure the police in
jacksonville and bradenton

1:13:19.137 --> 1:13:20.228
Are up to date.

1:13:20.379 --> 1:13:21.637
I'll call
state myself.

1:13:21.731 --> 1:13:23.639
And make sure you get
the family to tell you

1:13:23.733 --> 1:13:26.475
Everything they know, or
drag them into the station.

1:13:26.569 --> 1:13:28.569
Yes, sir.

1:13:28.721 --> 1:13:30.630
Neither ashley nor maggie seem
to know anything about florida,

1:13:30.723 --> 1:13:32.648
Or anymore than
they did before,

1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:34.224
Though I do think
they talk to him.

1:13:34.318 --> 1:13:36.727
Stephanie was the same, but
pamela's still or best bet.

1:13:36.821 --> 1:13:38.320
Well, let's see then.

1:14:29.207 --> 1:14:30.631
You can't know that.

1:14:32.527 --> 1:14:34.877
Look, it's, kara,
it's just been a day.

1:14:35.029 --> 1:14:36.637

take some time.

I don't need
time, mom.

1:14:38.308 --> 1:14:39.532
I don't need time, I just
need everything to be normal.

1:14:39.550 --> 1:14:42.143
Kara it is not.

1:14:42.294 --> 1:14:43.460
He is still out there.

1:14:48.151 --> 1:14:50.226
I am right here.

1:19:05.816 --> 1:19:09.535
(♪♪)
(cheering)

1:19:15.418 --> 1:19:18.143
(♪♪)

1:19:18.162 --> 1:19:20.996
<i> Kara, sweetheart,</i>
<i> rise and shine.</i>

1:19:21.090 --> 1:19:58.608
(♪♪)

1:19:58.702 --> 1:20:00.628
Hey, honey.
Hey.

1:20:00.855 --> 1:20:03.205
Good morning.

1:20:03.299 --> 1:20:04.614
What's going on?

1:20:04.708 --> 1:20:07.026
I made us some
breakfast.

1:20:07.119 --> 1:20:12.698
So, why don't
you take a seat.

1:20:12.791 --> 1:20:15.217
Wow, you never
make breakfast,

1:20:15.369 --> 1:20:19.555
And I'd much rather know
what's going on first.

1:20:19.649 --> 1:20:22.891
Okay.

1:20:23.044 --> 1:20:26.303
Well, sergeant jennings will
be here to explain more,

1:20:26.322 --> 1:20:27.896
And if you have
any questions,

1:20:28.049 --> 1:20:33.810
But last night that
man killed himself.

1:20:33.830 --> 1:20:36.497
So it's truly
over now, honey.

1:20:36.648 --> 1:20:37.998
You're safe.

1:20:38.150 --> 1:20:41.318
(♪♪)

1:20:41.337 --> 1:20:44.154
Why didn't anyone
tell me that?
I'm telling you
now, sweetheart.

1:20:44.248 --> 1:20:45.840
It happened
last night?

1:20:45.991 --> 1:20:48.658
Why didn't anyone tell me that
last night when it happened?

1:20:48.678 --> 1:20:51.345
There was no
reason to.

1:20:51.496 --> 1:20:55.165
I should have know-, what
is it that you're trying

1:20:55.184 --> 1:20:56.833
To protect me from?

1:20:56.853 --> 1:20:59.244
You were having a nice time
at the game like you wanted,

1:20:59.263 --> 1:21:00.646
So we didn't want to...

1:21:02.249 --> 1:21:03.691
(door slams)

1:21:03.842 --> 1:21:08.345
(♪♪)

1:21:08.364 --> 1:21:09.655
(car door slams)

1:21:14.353 --> 1:21:15.944
Hey there, kara.

1:21:16.038 --> 1:21:20.690
If you think that I'm
not mad at you, I-
no, I know.

1:21:20.710 --> 1:21:23.452
You're absolutely
right to be mad.

1:21:23.604 --> 1:21:27.106
If anyone deserved to know
what was happening it was you.

1:21:27.124 --> 1:21:29.532
We should have told
you right away.

1:21:29.627 --> 1:21:32.277
I should have
known better.

1:21:32.371 --> 1:21:34.722
I'm sorry I
broke that trust.

1:21:40.788 --> 1:21:46.567
You know, I'm not much trained
in this sort of thing.

1:21:46.718 --> 1:21:48.977
But if I had to
put money on it,

1:21:49.130 --> 1:21:52.072
I'd say you weren't just
mad about the delay.

1:21:58.489 --> 1:22:01.473
(♪♪)

1:22:01.492 --> 1:22:03.250
I'm mad at him.

1:22:03.402 --> 1:22:08.480
(♪♪)

1:22:08.499 --> 1:22:10.332
I'm just so
mad at him.

1:22:10.426 --> 1:22:14.261
(♪♪)

1:22:14.413 --> 1:22:16.171
And all I've been
thinking about,

1:22:16.323 --> 1:22:17.673
The only thing that's been
getting me through the

1:22:17.825 --> 1:22:21.827
Interviews and the exams and the
people and everyone staring,

1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:28.183
All I wanted was
just to get justice,

1:22:28.277 --> 1:22:30.669
And I wanted him to go to
jail for a hundred years,

1:22:30.762 --> 1:22:33.113
And I wanted him
to rot there.

1:22:33.265 --> 1:22:35.524
But only after I got to
stare him down in court,

1:22:35.676 --> 1:22:38.768
And made him face me, and I got
to tell him about everything

1:22:38.788 --> 1:22:43.773
That I remembered, and I'd let
him know that picking me was

1:22:43.867 --> 1:22:46.443
The biggest mistake that
he's ever made in his life.

1:22:46.462 --> 1:22:49.630
I don't know, I'm
just mad at him.

1:22:49.781 --> 1:22:52.541
I shouldn't have
yelled at my mom.

1:22:52.635 --> 1:22:56.211
(♪♪)

1:22:56.363 --> 1:22:58.305
That was messed up.

1:22:58.457 --> 1:23:07.815
(♪♪)

1:23:07.966 --> 1:23:09.650
So now that
there's no trial,

1:23:09.801 --> 1:23:11.318
I don't have to tell
my story in court.

1:23:11.545 --> 1:23:14.804
That's right.

1:23:14.898 --> 1:23:18.158
And my mom and my dad and
ryan aren't gonna have to know

1:23:18.310 --> 1:23:23.664
What actually, like, like
what actually happened.

1:23:23.815 --> 1:23:30.562
(♪♪)

1:23:30.655 --> 1:23:32.247
And they're not
gonna be hurt.

1:23:32.341 --> 1:23:42.165
(♪♪)

1:23:42.259 --> 1:23:44.092
Well, it's for
the best then.

1:23:44.186 --> 1:23:49.339
(♪♪)

1:23:49.358 --> 1:23:52.251
You're a hero, kara.

1:23:52.269 --> 1:23:55.678
I know it may not
always feel that way.

1:23:55.773 --> 1:23:59.349
But the way you
saved yourself,

1:23:59.368 --> 1:24:02.277
The way you, even now, are
taking care of the people

1:24:02.371 --> 1:24:07.766
You love, you're a hero.

1:24:07.859 --> 1:24:10.544
I'd hire you for the
force in a heartbeat.

1:24:10.695 --> 1:24:14.623
(♪♪)

1:24:14.717 --> 1:24:19.127
And as for evonitz, there is
no doubt he knew you were

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:22.114
His greatest mistake.

1:24:22.207 --> 1:24:25.225
And I couldn't be more
proud of you for it.

1:24:25.377 --> 1:24:33.625
(♪♪)

1:24:33.644 --> 1:24:35.127
Just give her
some time.

1:24:35.145 --> 1:24:36.403
She's processing a lot.

1:24:36.555 --> 1:24:39.965
(♪♪)

1:24:39.983 --> 1:24:41.575
Can you give us a second,
sergeant jennings?

1:24:41.726 --> 1:24:43.494
Of course.

1:24:47.641 --> 1:24:50.642
I don't really feel like
a hug right now, mom.

1:24:50.661 --> 1:24:52.086
Okay.

1:24:55.833 --> 1:24:58.333
It's not because
of, like...

1:24:58.485 --> 1:25:01.095
(exhales)

1:25:01.246 --> 1:25:05.173
(♪♪)

1:25:05.326 --> 1:25:07.101
...I just feel like I
really want to do what

1:25:07.252 --> 1:25:09.177
I feel like doing.

1:25:09.330 --> 1:25:14.516
Of course,
and I'm sorry.

1:25:14.610 --> 1:25:17.594
I'm trying.

1:25:17.688 --> 1:25:20.114
I don't know
what to do.

1:25:20.265 --> 1:25:21.857
I just really want
to be here for you.

1:25:22.009 --> 1:25:25.193
I know you do, and I'm
gonna try to let you know

1:25:25.287 --> 1:25:27.955
When you can be, okay.

1:25:28.106 --> 1:25:32.351
(♪♪)

1:25:32.444 --> 1:25:35.036
But you can't change
what happened.

1:25:35.131 --> 1:25:40.968
(♪♪)

1:25:41.119 --> 1:25:42.469
It happened.

1:25:42.621 --> 1:25:46.715
(♪♪)

1:25:46.867 --> 1:25:50.051
But I'm still here.

1:25:50.146 --> 1:25:51.720
I'm still me.

1:25:51.814 --> 1:26:00.320
(♪♪)

1:26:00.547 --> 1:26:02.322
I survived.

1:26:02.474 --> 1:26:19.506
(♪♪)

1:26:19.733 --> 1:26:21.341
I survived.

1:26:21.493 --> 1:26:39.985
(♪♪)

1:26:41.422 --> 1:27:38.252
(♪♪)
