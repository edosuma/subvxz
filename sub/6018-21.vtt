00:02.335 --> 00:04.200
The worst part about
a car breaking down...

00:05.572 --> 00:08.541
...is you're a guy. Because
now you have to get out...

00:08.708 --> 00:11.336
...and pretend like you know
what you're doing.

00:11.511 --> 00:16.710
You gotta go, "All right, honey,
I'm gonna go check it out."

00:17.450 --> 00:19.315
Walk around the front,
open up the hood.

00:19.786 --> 00:21.344
That's good, it obscures her view.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.785
That's the main reason
you want to do that.

00:23.957 --> 00:27.324
You're looking in there, hoping you're
going to see something in there...

00:27.494 --> 00:31.157
...so simple, so obvious,
so incredibly easy to fix...

00:31.331 --> 00:32.729
...even you can handle it.

00:32.899 --> 00:35.925
Like a giant on/off switch turned off.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.865
So you're going out
with David Puddy.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.771
Yeah. What, is that a problem?

00:43.943 --> 00:46.912
I think he could've asked me.
He's supposed to be a friend mine.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.538
I guess he figured you wouldn't care.
It has been a few years.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.584
Elaine, you always care
who an ex-girlfriend dates.

00:53.753 --> 00:55.220
You don't want someone
you know...

00:55.388 --> 00:57.379
...and you don't want
someone better than you.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.957
Now, even though the latter
is obviously impossible...

01:00.126 --> 01:02.617
-Oh, God.
-...the former still applies.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.196
I don't know, I just can't see you
with a mechanic.

01:05.364 --> 01:06.730
Oh, yeah, right, right.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.698
All those mechanics do
is work all day with their hands...

01:09.869 --> 01:11.359
...and their big muscular arms...

01:11.538 --> 01:13.369
...on machines,
and then they come home...

01:13.540 --> 01:16.998
...dripping with animal sexuality
like Stanley Kowalski.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.941
-What a huge turnoff that is.
-All right.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.946
Hey, look at that.
They got lobster on the menu.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.179
Who would order a lobster here?

01:29.355 --> 01:33.985
I mean, do they bring a lobster in
every day hoping, "Today's the day."

01:34.761 --> 01:36.786
So what if they have a lobster?

01:36.963 --> 01:39.932
Suddenly you're
a shellfish connoisseur?

01:40.500 --> 01:43.492
I think we really need to be
in front of a television set.

01:43.670 --> 01:47.868
You take TV out of this relationship,
it is just torture.

01:49.476 --> 01:53.037
So I'm getting an eye job.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.610
An eye job?
Ma, you don't need an eye job.

01:55.782 --> 01:58.649
-Georgie, I'm a divorcée.
-You're not a divorcée.

01:58.818 --> 02:01.616
You're just separated.
You're a "separatée."

02:01.788 --> 02:04.086
-Well, I'm out there, George.
-You're not out there.

02:04.257 --> 02:06.316
-I am too.
-You're not out there.

02:06.493 --> 02:08.085
You can't be,
because I am out there.

02:08.261 --> 02:09.558
And if I see you out there...

02:09.729 --> 02:11.754
...there's not enough voltage
in this world...

02:11.931 --> 02:14.923
...to electroshock me
back into coherence.

02:16.669 --> 02:19.194
Well, anyway, the operation
is on Tuesday...

02:19.372 --> 02:23.706
...and I need you to drive me home
because I'll be all drugged up.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.309
Tuesday? I can't do Tuesday.
Steinbrenner needs me--

02:26.479 --> 02:29.209
This is the only time the doctor had.

02:29.382 --> 02:32.180
-Kramer, hey! Come on over here.
-I gotta go somewhere.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.684
No, you're gonna sit down,
you son of a gun.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.947
All right, I'm sitting down.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.852
How are you?

02:39.259 --> 02:43.753
So, Kramer, I'm getting an eye job.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.261
Yeah, good for you.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.558
You have to look your best.
You're out there now.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.668
She's not out there.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.802
-So who's your doctor?
-Bakersaul.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.371
He's good. He's very good.

02:56.543 --> 02:59.512
He worked on this kid
from Guatemala with no nose...

02:59.679 --> 03:01.738
...turned him into
Ricardo Montalban.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.940
Hey, Kramer, what are
you doing Tuesday?

03:04.117 --> 03:05.744
Tuesday?

03:06.352 --> 03:08.411
Why doesn't he pick you up
after the operation?

03:08.588 --> 03:10.419
He's got the car
with the seats you like.

03:10.590 --> 03:11.989
-I don't care.
-Yeah, I know.

03:12.158 --> 03:15.753
But I can't drive anybody anywhere
until I go down to get my new plates.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.420
-Well, giddyup.
-All right.

03:20.033 --> 03:24.561
I'm here to pick up my new plates.
My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.

03:26.439 --> 03:27.872
Kramer.

03:28.675 --> 03:30.404
-All right.
-All right.

03:30.577 --> 03:34.035
-Sign right here, please.
-Okay.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.708
Alrighty.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.182
Thanks.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.056
No, these don't belong to me.
I'm not the Assman.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.162
I think there's been a mistake.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.731
-What's your name again?
-Cosmo Kramer.

03:53.132 --> 03:56.966
Cosmo Kramer.
You are the Assman.

03:57.937 --> 04:00.462
No, I'm not the Assman.

04:00.640 --> 04:05.407
Well, as far as the state of New York
is concerned, you are.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:20.959 --> 04:22.757
How do you feel?

04:22.996 --> 04:24.964
Fine.

04:26.065 --> 04:27.692
Something the matter?

04:27.867 --> 04:29.494
No.

04:30.470 --> 04:31.801
Then what is it?

04:32.338 --> 04:34.067
No, nothing.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.409
Hey.

04:43.416 --> 04:47.045
-I was with David Puddy last night.
-Yeah, so?

04:47.220 --> 04:49.120
He did the move.

04:50.857 --> 04:56.056
-What move?
-You know, the move.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.992
Wait a second, my move?

04:58.164 --> 04:59.893
David Puddy used my move?

05:00.066 --> 05:02.125
-Yes, Yes.
-Are you sure?

05:02.302 --> 05:06.363
Jerry, there is no confusing
that move with any other move.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.866
I can't believe it. He stole my move.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.701
What else did you tell him?

05:11.878 --> 05:14.039
The two of you must have had
quite a little chat.

05:14.213 --> 05:17.580
Oh, it wasn't like that.
I didn't even mention you.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.514
We were in the garage.
You know how garages are.

05:20.687 --> 05:25.249
They're conducive to sex talk.
It's a high-testosterone area.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.825
Because of all the pistons
and the lube jobs?

05:27.994 --> 05:30.656
Well, I'm going to that garage
to tell him to stop doing it.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.856
-Well, wait-- Wait a second.
-What?

05:34.033 --> 05:37.002
Isn't that a little rash?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.536
No, he stole my move.

05:41.441 --> 05:45.104
Yeah, but I like the move.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.880
Yeah, but it's like another comedian
stealing my material.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.141
He doesn't even do it
exactly the same.

05:51.317 --> 05:55.413
He uses a pinch at the end
instead of the swirl.

05:56.022 --> 06:00.584
Oh, yeah, the pinch.
I've done the pinch.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.694
That's not new.

06:02.962 --> 06:05.362
I don't know how you can trust
any of his moves now.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.897
His whole repertoire
could be lifted.

06:09.469 --> 06:12.233
You know, it's strange, because
he's such an honest mechanic.

06:12.405 --> 06:15.272
I know, he's probably the only
honest mechanic in New York.

06:15.675 --> 06:18.473
So he stole my move,
and he's using it on Elaine.

06:18.644 --> 06:21.078
You told David Puddy your move,
and you didn't tell me?

06:21.247 --> 06:23.442
I need a move.
You know I have no moves, Jerry.

06:23.616 --> 06:25.811
-Give me a bite.
-Can I just get it open first?

06:25.985 --> 06:28.044
I can't believe you're
hoarding sex moves.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.247
I'm rubbing two sticks together,
you're walking around with a Zippo.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.392
All right, all right. Here.

06:34.260 --> 06:35.659
That's good. That's very good.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.591
-You feel better?
-Yeah, much better.

06:37.764 --> 06:40.096
So, what's the move?
Because I need something.

06:40.266 --> 06:43.099
This woman I'm dating is doing
her nails during lovemaking.

06:43.269 --> 06:44.463
-Nancy Klopper?
-Yeah.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.332
I've never seen anyone so bored.

06:46.506 --> 06:49.066
I'm working like a dog here.
Give me a moan, something.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.473
I'd settle for a belch, for God's sake.
Come on, let's have it.

06:52.645 --> 06:55.705
All right, George, I'm gonna tell you.
But I just want to make sure--

06:55.882 --> 06:58.282
Yeah, it's in the vault.
I'm putting it in the vault.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.112
It's not even a question of that.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.811
The point is, when something
like this is passed along...

07:02.989 --> 07:06.288
...one must be certain that it's going
to be used in a conscientious way.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.484
This is not some parlor trick
to be used...

07:08.661 --> 07:11.186
-...pell-mell or willy-nilly.
-You gonna tell me or not?

07:11.597 --> 07:13.258
All right.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.993
On your bed, you got a headboard?
You'll need a headboard.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.227
I got a headboard.

07:17.403 --> 07:18.563
-Is it padded?
-No.

07:18.738 --> 07:20.365
Good.

07:20.673 --> 07:23.733
-How tall is she?
-Five-foot-4, why?

07:23.910 --> 07:26.811
You can't have more than
a 1 foot differential in your heights.

07:26.979 --> 07:29.573
Otherwise you could
really hurt your neck.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.841
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this.

07:32.018 --> 07:35.385
George, if you can master this,
you'll never be alone again.

07:38.724 --> 07:41.818
Now the end is kind of an option.
I use the swirl.

07:41.994 --> 07:44.758
I like the swirl.
I'm comfortable with the swirl.

07:44.931 --> 07:47.900
I feel the swirl is a great capper.

07:48.067 --> 07:51.332
He uses the pinch,
which I find a little presumptuous.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.803
-Is it a clockwise swirl?
-I prefer clockwise.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.067
But it's not written in stone.

08:01.347 --> 08:03.372
There you go, buddy.

08:04.584 --> 08:08.520
-What is it?
-It's fusilli Jerry.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.490
It's made from fusilli pasta.

08:13.659 --> 08:14.990
See the microphone?

08:15.161 --> 08:17.994
-When did you do this?
-In my spare time.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.897
I'm working on one of you, George.
I'm using ravioli.

08:23.836 --> 08:28.500
See, the hard part is to find
a pasta that captures the individual.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.299
-Why fusilli?
-Because you're silly.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.636
Get it?

08:36.349 --> 08:39.010
-Yeah.
-Well, thank you very much.

08:39.184 --> 08:43.587
-So did you get your new plates?
-Oh, yeah, I got my new plates.

08:43.756 --> 08:44.780
But they mixed them up.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.187
Somebody got mine,
and I got their vanity plates.

08:47.493 --> 08:50.462
-What do they say?
-"Assman."

08:51.697 --> 08:53.028
-Assman?
-Yeah, Assman, Jerry.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.396
I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.927
Who would order a license plate
that says Assman?

09:00.439 --> 09:02.566
Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.842
It doesn't have to be someone
who gets lots of woman.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.311
It could be just some guy
with a big ass.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.883
-Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.
-Yeah.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.154
-Proctologist.
-No, come on.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.257
No doctor would put that
on his car.

09:19.425 --> 09:22.360
Have you ever met a proctologist?

09:22.929 --> 09:25.489
Well, they usually have
a very good sense of humor.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.566
You meet a proctologist at a party,
don't walk away.

09:28.734 --> 09:32.101
Plant yourself there. You will hear
the funniest stories you've ever heard.

09:32.705 --> 09:37.301
See, no one wants to admit to them
that they stuck something up there.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.744
Never. It's always an accident.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.278
Every proctologist's story
ends in the same way:

09:42.448 --> 09:45.906
"It was a million-1 shot, doc.
Million-1."

09:46.586 --> 09:48.417
There's my phone.

09:50.056 --> 09:54.186
-So where you gonna stick this?
-I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.128
Hey, David.

09:58.297 --> 09:59.321
Oh, hi, Jerry.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.966
Hey, what's the story?
I hear you're doing my move.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.324
What move?

10:03.502 --> 10:05.561
What move? My move.
The one I told you about.

10:05.738 --> 10:07.103
You used it on Elaine.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.833
What, are you kidding?
I was doing that before I knew you.

10:10.009 --> 10:13.035
-All you told me about was the end.
-The ending is the whole thing.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.806
Without the ending, it's nothing.
You had nothing.

10:15.982 --> 10:19.110
That ending was so obvious.
I would've figured that out anyway.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.276
Didn't need you to tell me
that stupid twist.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.944
-Twirl.
-Whatever, I don't do it.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.522
-Yeah, I know. You do the pinch.
-Yeah. That's right.

10:25.691 --> 10:28.660
You can't come up with your own stuff,
so you steal other people's?

10:28.828 --> 10:30.022
You're nothing but a hack.

10:30.329 --> 10:32.854
Are you through,
because I've gotta get back to work.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.226
I'll tell you what I'll do.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.733
If you wanna do it out of town, okay.
But not in the city.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.905
The next time your car breaks down,
take that out of town.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.904
-Fine.
-Good.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.355
George!

11:04.130 --> 11:05.529
What are you doing?

11:08.834 --> 11:10.392
I'm...

11:10.569 --> 11:12.161
...you know...

11:12.838 --> 11:14.169
...pleasuring you.

11:14.907 --> 11:16.898
Well, stop it.

11:18.277 --> 11:21.474
-You don't like the move?
-No, I don't.

11:21.781 --> 11:24.375
-You're kidding.
-No, I'm not.

11:24.550 --> 11:28.213
It feels like aliens
poking at my body.

11:30.289 --> 11:31.779
Sorry.

11:32.491 --> 11:35.517
I'll just go back to my usual routine.

11:38.497 --> 11:41.728
Oh, God. Oh, God, Dave!

11:41.901 --> 11:43.266
Oh, yes, yes.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.301
-I'm sorry.
-What?

11:45.471 --> 11:47.496
I can't do the move.

11:47.673 --> 11:50.039
-What?
-He's ruined it for me.

11:50.910 --> 11:54.368
-Oh, come on. Please?
-No, he called me a hack.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.208
I'm just not into doing it anymore.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.213
So that's it?

12:00.619 --> 12:02.883
I'll come up with some new stuff.

12:09.295 --> 12:14.062
<i>"Call me. 36-24-46.
I think I have what you're looking for."</i>

12:22.575 --> 12:25.442
I must caution you about one thing:

12:25.611 --> 12:28.978
You can't cry for at least 10 days.
You can ruin the operation.

12:29.148 --> 12:31.173
Oh, okay.

12:31.350 --> 12:33.545
Now, is someone coming
to pick you up?

12:33.719 --> 12:38.156
Yes, my son's friend
should be here any minute.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.934
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, Dr. Cosmo Kramer. Proctology.

12:53.672 --> 12:57.073
-Okay. Sure, doctor.
-Thanks. Have a good day.

13:02.181 --> 13:04.581
I just can't get over
how fantastic you look.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.479
-Oh, really?
-Oh, yeah.

13:06.652 --> 13:08.552
This takes 20 years off.

13:08.721 --> 13:12.555
And it was all done by laser.
I don't even need bandages.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.592
Yo, Assman. Look at the Assman.

13:15.761 --> 13:18.059
-Did he say, "Assman"?
-Yeah.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.721
Oh, my goodness.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.561
-Hey, the Assman's in town.
-You got that straight.

13:24.904 --> 13:28.567
Boy, I never dreamed
it could make such a difference.

13:43.789 --> 13:46.257
Well, you must have done
something wrong.

13:46.892 --> 13:50.384
You probably screwed up the order.
Did you close with the swirl?

13:50.563 --> 13:52.827
You're supposed to close
with the swirl?

13:53.165 --> 13:56.692
Oh, my God.
Yes, you close with the swirl.

13:56.869 --> 14:00.100
There's a progression there.
I told you to write it down.

14:00.272 --> 14:03.503
Yeah, yeah.
Should've written it down.

14:05.277 --> 14:06.266
-Yeah?
-<i>Elaine.</i>

14:06.445 --> 14:07.434
All right.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.040
Do me a favor.
Don't even do the move anymore.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.081
You're gonna give it a bad name.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.282
Hello.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.421
Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld.

14:16.822 --> 14:20.451
What? $2800?

14:20.626 --> 14:22.685
That's the estimate on my car?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.456
No, don't even do anything.

14:25.631 --> 14:28.691
I'm gonna think about it.
Okay, bye.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.928
What's to think about?
Puddy's not gonna cheat you.

14:32.104 --> 14:34.368
-Except it's not Puddy.
-What happened to Puddy?

14:34.540 --> 14:37.236
We had a fight about the move.
I took it to this other place.

14:37.409 --> 14:41.072
-I think they're trying to screw me.
-Of course they're trying to screw you.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.579
That's what they do.
They can make up anything.

14:43.749 --> 14:44.773
Nobody knows.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.748
"By the way, you need
a new Johnson rod in here."

14:47.920 --> 14:51.549
"Oh, Johnson rod? Yeah, well,
better put one of those on."

14:53.859 --> 14:56.919
-Hey, Elaine.
-Yeah, yeah, hello.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.997
-Was it something I said?
-Yes, as a matter of fact.

15:00.165 --> 15:02.395
David Puddy won't
do the move anymore.

15:02.968 --> 15:03.992
Really?

15:04.169 --> 15:07.627
He's come up with some other move.
You should see this thing.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.069
-What is it?
-It's a lot of just fancy stuff.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.302
You know what it's like?

15:13.479 --> 15:17.939
It's like big-budget movie
with a story that goes nowhere.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.714
I mean, this move is no good, Jerry.
It's just taking up a lot of my time.

15:23.889 --> 15:29.384
And I will not stand by and allow him
to perform this move on me...

15:29.561 --> 15:33.429
...while a perfectly good move is
just sitting in the barn doing nothing.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.498
Let me ask you a question.
This new move...

15:38.904 --> 15:41.202
...is there a knuckle involved
in any way?

15:42.541 --> 15:44.805
Yes. Yes, as a matter of fact
there is.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.569
I think that's mine.

15:49.248 --> 15:51.273
I'm not surprised.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.586
Listen, I need you
to do me a favor.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.618
When's the next time
you're gonna see him?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.257
-Why?
-Get an estimate on my car from him.

15:59.425 --> 16:00.949
This garage is trying to screw me.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.617
An estimate?
How am I supposed to do that?

16:03.796 --> 16:06.230
Look, here's the work order
with everything that broke.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.856
Just kind of bring it up
at the right time and find out.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.801
What? What is this?

16:13.105 --> 16:16.563
That's fusilli Jerry.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.639
-Fusilli Jerry?
-Yeah, Kramer made it.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.981
-All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
-All right.

16:23.282 --> 16:26.115
-Hey, Assman.
-Hey.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.880
-Well, this is Sally.
-Hello.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.250
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.585
-Shall we go? All right.
-Okay.

16:43.769 --> 16:46.829
You can't face the fact
that I'm improving myself.

16:47.239 --> 16:49.264
You're not the only one
improving yourself.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.534
I worked out with a dumbbell
yesterday.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.234
I feel vigorous.

16:54.246 --> 16:57.841
Just take your mail and go home.
I have things to do.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.951
I got things to do too.

17:00.119 --> 17:03.555
Don't upset me. I can't cry!

17:05.124 --> 17:08.059
Getting an eye job like some
Manhattanite, huh?

17:08.394 --> 17:11.557
Well, it's already working.
Kramer made a pass at me.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.221
Kramer made a pass at you?
You're crazy.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.200
I'm not crazy.
He stopped short and made a grab.

17:18.369 --> 17:21.464
He stopped short? That's my move.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.031
I'm gonna kill him.

17:30.482 --> 17:33.974
-Hey, let me ask you a question.
-Sure.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.684
What do you charge
for blown shocks?

17:36.855 --> 17:40.188
-What?
-Two-, 300?

17:40.659 --> 17:43.093
I don't know, maybe 500.

17:52.371 --> 17:55.636
-What about a bad gasket?
-Bad gasket?

17:55.808 --> 17:58.902
Yeah, like a terrible gasket.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.305
-What is all this?
-Nothing, nothing.

18:02.481 --> 18:06.474
I'm just taking an interest
in what you do.

18:07.286 --> 18:08.617
What kind of car is it?

18:10.722 --> 18:14.283
Any kind of a Swedish car.

18:14.726 --> 18:16.751
All together that could run
about 1600.

18:20.466 --> 18:22.627
Is that with the parts and labor?

18:26.805 --> 18:29.672
No. Dave, no, please.
Not the knuckle.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.744
Well...

18:36.648 --> 18:40.311
...that was great.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.349
I mean....

18:45.257 --> 18:46.781
It just came to me.

18:48.760 --> 18:54.630
I've never in my life-- I've--
What was that?

18:55.167 --> 18:57.465
You mean in the end?

18:58.070 --> 19:00.664
A counterclockwise swirl.

19:01.807 --> 19:02.933
-What's that?
-What?

19:03.108 --> 19:05.906
-On your hand? Let me see.
-Nothing. I don't know. It's a mole.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.545
-Let me see.
-Just a little dirt.

19:07.713 --> 19:10.045
I wanna see what's on your hand.
Give me your hand.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.274
"Number one, take her leg--"

19:12.451 --> 19:17.889
Oh, my God. Crib notes?
You've got crib notes?

19:18.090 --> 19:22.720
It's a very complicated move.
I couldn't remember it all.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.795
Oh, my God, you're sick.

19:25.464 --> 19:28.262
You know, it's not the SATs.

19:37.576 --> 19:41.307
Assman? I'll give him Assman!

19:44.283 --> 19:46.843
Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all?

19:47.019 --> 19:48.850
They are ripping me off.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.854
-So, what are you gonna do?
-That's it. I'm going back to Puddy.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.389
No move is worth this.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.459
You don't care
if he does the move anymore?

19:55.627 --> 19:58.460
Are you kidding? He could do
every move I've ever done.

19:58.630 --> 20:02.657
Do you know what a good mechanic is
worth? You can't compare that to sex.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.263
-Hi, Mr. Costanza, what's--?
-Where's your friend, Kramer?

20:07.439 --> 20:09.771
-I don't know, why?
-I'm looking for him, that's why.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.035
-He stopped short.
-What do you mean?

20:12.511 --> 20:14.342
In the car with my wife.
He stopped short.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.310
You think I don't know
what that's about?

20:16.481 --> 20:19.006
That's my own move.
I used it on Estelle 40 years ago.

20:19.184 --> 20:22.017
I told everybody about it.
Everybody knows...

20:22.187 --> 20:24.212
...I stop short.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.722
Really? Stopping short?
That's a good move.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.259
You're not kidding
it's a good move.

20:30.429 --> 20:31.896
-Hey.
-Hey, Frank.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.465
Don't "Frank" me. I know what you did.
How dare you stop short with my wife?

20:35.634 --> 20:38.569
Come on, Frank, relax. I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.865
You think I don't know, Assman?

20:42.374 --> 20:45.104
To think I almost split the profits
on the Mansiere with you.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.505
-Bro.
-Mansiere!

20:46.678 --> 20:48.145
-Bro!
-Mansiere!

20:54.686 --> 20:57.348
Oh, my God.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.230
If I wasn't there,
I wouldn't have believed it.

21:07.399 --> 21:09.299
Me either.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.499
They say this guy's the best.

21:13.905 --> 21:16.169
He had to use corkscrew pasta.

21:26.084 --> 21:28.109
Jerry, Jerry, come here.
Take a look at this.

21:28.854 --> 21:31.049
The name on the boat.
Look at it.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.023
-Assman!
-Yeah, he's the Assman.

21:34.192 --> 21:35.955
Jerry, he's the Assman.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.653
-Which one is the son?
-I am.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.058
I'm Dr. Cooperman.

21:40.232 --> 21:45.329
I just want you to know that this won't
take long and he's going to be fine.

21:45.837 --> 21:51.241
Excuse me, you didn't by any chance
recently get the wrong license plates?

21:51.410 --> 21:55.346
Yes, I'm still waiting for the Motor
Vehicle Bureau to straighten it out.

21:55.514 --> 21:57.982
So you're the Assman.

22:01.853 --> 22:05.846
<i>Million-1 shot, doc. Million-1.</i>

22:17.669 --> 22:21.298
Where have you been?
You were supposed to fix the stove.

22:21.473 --> 22:23.498
I've been waiting for hours.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.143
I fell on some fusilli.

22:26.978 --> 22:30.641
-Fusilli?
-You know, the corkscrew pasta.

22:30.816 --> 22:33.614
It was a fusilli Jerry.

22:33.785 --> 22:37.243
It got stuck in me.
I had to go to the proctologist.

22:37.422 --> 22:40.323
The proctologist? Are you okay?

22:40.492 --> 22:43.086
-Yeah.
-Oh, I was so worried.

22:43.261 --> 22:45.388
-Ma, don't cry!
-Oh, I can't help it!

22:45.564 --> 22:47.589
Ma, your eyes!
