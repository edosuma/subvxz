01:46.973 --> 01:49.237
Stay behind the red line.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.912
Personal effects.

02:58.611 --> 02:59.635
Excuse me, sir.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.773
- Ma'am.
- Sergeant.

03:04.450 --> 03:07.180
Sergeant, do you have
a Brenda Walsh down here?

03:07.654 --> 03:10.145
Yeah, she's here.
The animal crusader?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.625
- Yeah, can we see her?
- She's gonna be arraigned at 9:30.

03:13.793 --> 03:16.728
Visiting hours don't begin till 10:30.
Otherwise, post her bail.

03:17.197 --> 03:21.190
- How much?
- Bail was preset at $50,000.

03:22.101 --> 03:23.125
What did she do?

03:23.303 --> 03:25.999
Burglary, criminal trespass,
destruction of property.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.736
She was arrested
breaking into a research laboratory

03:28.908 --> 03:30.375
on the campus at C.U.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.374
So how do I get her out of here?

03:32.545 --> 03:35.309
You can put up the 50 grand
or go to a bondsman.

03:35.481 --> 03:38.609
There's one across the street
that's open 24 hours.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.343
Thank you.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.587
So, what do we do now?

03:45.758 --> 03:48.955
Well, I didn't want it to come to this,
but I'm gonna have to tell her parents.

03:49.128 --> 03:51.653
I don't understand why
we just didn't do that in the first place.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.025
I promised her I wouldn't.

03:53.199 --> 03:55.360
Well, I guess you're gonna have to
break your promise.

03:55.535 --> 03:56.866
What's your problem, Kel?

03:57.337 --> 04:00.397
Why is it that every time
Brenda's in trouble, she calls you first?

04:00.573 --> 04:02.131
You're not her guardian angel.

04:02.308 --> 04:04.435
Do you even hear
what's coming out of your mouth, huh?

04:04.611 --> 04:06.340
One of our friends
is down here in trouble

04:06.512 --> 04:08.946
and you're giving me a problem
because I came to get her out?

04:09.115 --> 04:11.379
I'm just not used to
having to bail my friends out of jail

04:11.551 --> 04:13.348
in the middle of the night.

04:18.891 --> 04:21.086
So, what's Steve's dad like anyway?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.853
Well, I've only met him
a couple of times.

04:23.029 --> 04:26.089
He's kind of like Steve, only with
a little more killer instinct, maybe.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.201
Well, Steve hasn't quite finished
maturing yet.

04:30.970 --> 04:32.665
That's them.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.809
- Good morning.
- Hey, Bran. You remember my dad?

04:38.978 --> 04:40.639
Absolutely.
How are you doing, Mr. Sanders?

04:40.813 --> 04:42.576
- It's Rush.
- And this is his father, Jim.

04:42.749 --> 04:43.875
- Jim, good to see you.
- Hey.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.540
This is terrific.
Thanks for having us.

04:45.718 --> 04:47.618
No problem.
Should be a great tournament.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.880
My son tells me
you haven't played in a while.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.957
Well, actually, I haven't swung a club
since we left Minnesota

04:53.126 --> 04:54.923
- about three years ago.
- Four years, Dad.

04:55.094 --> 04:56.994
- But who's counting?
- I tell you what we do.

04:57.163 --> 04:59.427
Why don't we get you out
on the course, get you warmed up?

04:59.599 --> 05:02.295
We won't have any
embarrassing moments on the tee.

05:02.835 --> 05:05.963
My dad used to be the club champ,
so he doesn't let anybody forget that.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.165
- Come on, will you?
- Okay, let's go.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.809
- Got it?
- Yeah.

05:16.115 --> 05:18.413
- Should we follow you out there?
- No, we'll take my car.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.814
Of course, we'll take that car.
It's a brand-new Bentley.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.284
He's gotta show it off.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.548
I'm not showing it off, son,
I'm breaking it in.

05:24.724 --> 05:27.625
- And it's a Turbo Bentley.
- Very nice wheels, Rush.

05:27.794 --> 05:30.092
- Do you wanna drive, Brandon?
- Love to.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.788
Hey, wait a second.
How come you never let me drive?

05:32.965 --> 05:36.457
Well, I don't think Brandon has gotten
three speeding tickets in 18 months.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.361
- Do you?
- No, sir.

05:38.538 --> 05:39.562
- Drive.
- Thank you.

05:42.475 --> 05:48.038
- What's Dylan doing here? It's 6:15.
- Maybe he's delivering hot bagels.

05:48.214 --> 05:51.206
- Hey, guys, I'm glad you're up.
- Dylan, what's the matter?

05:51.384 --> 05:53.045
I need to talk to you for a minute,
Jim.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.822
- Excuse us, it will just take a minute.
- No problem.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.386
I think it's gonna take
a little longer than that.

06:01.127 --> 06:03.561
Wait, wait, wait. Arrested?

06:03.730 --> 06:05.425
That's impossible.
She's upstairs, sleeping.

06:05.598 --> 06:07.998
Jim, if she's sleeping anywhere,
which I doubt,

06:08.167 --> 06:10.226
it's downtown at the county jail.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.963
- What is going on?
- Are you ready for this?

06:13.139 --> 06:15.539
Brenda, your daughter,
was arrested last night.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.437
Bail is set at $50,000.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.204
- What?
- Fifty thousand dollars?

06:20.380 --> 06:21.779
What on earth did she do?

06:21.948 --> 06:24.075
I don't know the details,
but apparently she got caught

06:24.250 --> 06:26.480
breaking into an animal research lab
on the campus.

06:26.652 --> 06:29.883
Oh, my God.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.251
What are we gonna do?

06:32.425 --> 06:35.121
Well, find a good criminal attorney,
for starters.

06:35.294 --> 06:38.024
Yeah. Do it quick. She's being
arraigned at 9:30 this morning.

06:38.197 --> 06:40.631
Oh, God.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.137
What a mess.

06:50.309 --> 06:53.244
This is worse than it looked
after the earthquake.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.278
You know, I saw Judy down the hall.

06:55.448 --> 06:58.042
She said there are hundreds
of kittens everywhere.

06:58.217 --> 07:01.084
Well, look on the bright side.
Maybe they'll catch the mice.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.815
At last count, we had 157 in our lab.
Now they're all over the building.

07:04.991 --> 07:07.653
They say they're a defender
of animal rights, but I don't get it.

07:07.827 --> 07:11.923
We were not hurting these animals,
we were studying their sleep patterns.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.532
Oh, sweetie.

07:19.672 --> 07:21.196
Oh, he's shivering.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.342
Hey, buddy.
I'm gonna get you something to eat.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.340
Yeah.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.437
So, what's gonna happen
to these animals?

07:27.613 --> 07:29.376
Well, unless you've got
a very big house

07:29.549 --> 07:31.278
and an awful lot of kibble,

07:31.451 --> 07:33.885
they're gonna have to go
back where we found them.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.849
Can't we give them away?

07:36.656 --> 07:39.750
Knock yourself out, Andrea.
They're all up for adoption.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.593
At least they caught
the people who did this.

07:44.764 --> 07:48.097
I hope they lock up every one
of those misanthropic lunatics

07:48.267 --> 07:50.030
and throw away the key.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.228
From your mouth...

07:53.539 --> 07:55.507
Remand the defendant to custody

07:55.675 --> 08:00.135
and the pretrial hearing
is set for two weeks from today.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.144
Next.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.580
Poor Brenda. She must be terrified.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.776
Don't worry, Mom,
she'll get through it.

08:07.954 --> 08:09.888
Yeah, she can be pretty tough
sometimes.

08:10.056 --> 08:12.024
I hope so.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.717
- Did you post the bail?
- Yeah.

08:15.895 --> 08:19.524
- What did the attorney say?
- Things don't look so good.

08:19.699 --> 08:22.759
The lab she broke into
was doing government research.

08:22.935 --> 08:25.870
She could be charged
with a federal offense.

08:33.446 --> 08:34.936
This is all your fault.

08:35.114 --> 08:38.174
Oh, shut up, Jon. You don't know
what you're talking about.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.784
Who else tipped the cops?
We should have known.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.320
Prancing in at the eleventh hour,
begging us to go along.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.684
I swear, I didn't tell anybody.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.190
Yeah, well, you better pray
you didn't tell anybody.

08:48.361 --> 08:52.957
Leave her alone.
She's a kid. She's scared.

08:53.132 --> 08:57.262
Well, she better learn to grow up
real fast.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.402
Walsh, Brenda. On your feet.

09:11.183 --> 09:13.174
Great.
We're stuck with two no-shows.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.916
Dad, Brenda got arrested.
What did you expect them to do?

09:16.088 --> 09:19.057
Let her sit there and rot in jail
so they can make our foursome?

09:19.225 --> 09:22.558
Well, if they bail her out quick,
they can get over here by tee time.

09:23.362 --> 09:24.386
Dad...

09:24.564 --> 09:26.964
- Rush, I'm glad I found you.
- Hey, Bill, what's up?

09:27.133 --> 09:29.693
It turns out your partners
aren't the only ones who scratched.

09:29.869 --> 09:32.303
Some kind of stomach bug
going around the Westside.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.063
So I'm gonna have to reshuffle
the decks.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.140
I've got you with your old nemesis,
Barry Larson.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.571
Come on,
you've gotta be kidding.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.576
Sorry. His tee time was right behind
yours, so you're going together.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.338
Oh, for crying out loud.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.107
Is that Barry Larson
the baseball player?

09:44.283 --> 09:47.548
No, the podiatrist.
Of course, the baseball player.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.950
That guy's been a boil on my butt
at this club for years.

09:50.122 --> 09:53.216
And why is that, Dad?
Did he beat you or something?

09:53.459 --> 09:56.986
You be on your game today.
The Larsons are going down.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.336
- Beautiful day, ain't it?
- You got that right.

10:05.504 --> 10:07.495
Nice day.

10:08.174 --> 10:10.665
Hey, Rush. Here we go again.

10:10.843 --> 10:14.142
Well, if it isn't the Larsons.
How are you, Barry?

10:14.313 --> 10:17.077
Oh, I'm doing good, I can't complain.
You remember my dad.

10:17.249 --> 10:19.615
Ben, how you doing?
You know my son, Steve?

10:19.785 --> 10:20.911
- How are you?
- Good.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.385
Are you as good with a golf club
as you are with a bat?

10:23.556 --> 10:24.580
I do my best.

10:24.757 --> 10:27.055
How come we haven't seen you
around here before, Steve?

10:27.226 --> 10:29.353
I just haven't been playing much golf
lately.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.018
Well, you've missed
those opportunities

10:31.197 --> 10:32.664
to watch me trounce
your old man here.

10:32.832 --> 10:35.733
It's beginning to be something of
a tradition at our yearly tournaments.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.400
Yeah, well the tradition
is about to be broken.

10:38.571 --> 10:39.731
And so is that streak.

10:39.905 --> 10:42.430
I wouldn't count on it,
unless Steve has a hell of a swing.

10:42.608 --> 10:43.768
I taught him.

10:43.943 --> 10:47.310
In that case,
we ain't got nothing to worry about.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.879
Don't get on him, Dad.

10:49.548 --> 10:52.415
Oh, don't tell me
those guys get to you.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.414
Yes, they get to me.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.317
This time they're gonna lose,
I promise you.

11:00.326 --> 11:04.763
Miss Walsh, you are charged
with conspiracy to commit burglary,

11:04.930 --> 11:06.397
conspiracy to commit theft,

11:06.565 --> 11:10.126
breaking and entering with intent
to destroy federal property.

11:10.302 --> 11:12.770
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

11:12.938 --> 11:15.532
Your Honor,
Miss Walsh has no record,

11:15.708 --> 11:18.768
strong ties to the community,
and clearly there's no risk of flight.

11:18.944 --> 11:21.276
We request
that her bond be reduced.

11:21.447 --> 11:24.075
Your honor, even though
there may not be risk of flight,

11:24.250 --> 11:26.309
we feel that the nature of the crime
is severe enough

11:26.485 --> 11:28.612
that bond be held
at the preset amount.

11:31.223 --> 11:32.815
Reduction request denied.

11:33.292 --> 11:35.692
Bail has been set and posted
at $50,000.

11:35.861 --> 11:40.264
The next court date
is three weeks from today.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.230
Defendant is free to go on bond.

11:47.406 --> 11:51.706
Well, thank God that's over.
At least now she can come home.

11:51.877 --> 11:55.210
Yeah. For the time being at least,
she's our problem.

12:09.228 --> 12:13.688
Look what I found under my bed.
A posthumous present from Rocky.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.702
- I miss him.
- Yeah, me too.

12:19.605 --> 12:22.699
Who would have thought taking in
a dog would have started all of this?

12:22.875 --> 12:25.207
Somehow,
I don't think this is his fault.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.106
You know, I just...
I just keep thinking that...

12:28.280 --> 12:30.077
What if I'd gone along
with Brenda last night?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.212
You never would have done
anything like that.

12:32.384 --> 12:33.874
Why?
You don't think I have the guts?

12:34.320 --> 12:38.086
Donna, it's not a matter of guts.
It's a matter of judgment.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.886
Which you have.
And I'm not always sure Brenda does.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.191
When you ran off to Mexico
with Dylan,

12:50.369 --> 12:52.200
I got that phone call
from a customs inspector

12:52.371 --> 12:55.863
to retrieve you at the border.
I thought that was pretty bad.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.904
Then you packed up
and moved back to Minnesota,

13:00.079 --> 13:03.048
where you attended college
for a grand total of four days.

13:03.215 --> 13:08.551
Then you pulled that ridiculous stunt.
You eloped to Las Vegas with Stuart,

13:08.721 --> 13:11.986
and I thought, "This is it.
This is the lamest thing she'll ever do. "

13:12.158 --> 13:13.625
But you know what?

13:14.527 --> 13:15.619
I was wrong.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.662
- Dad, I can explain.
- I'd love to hear it.

13:19.265 --> 13:22.234
I was fighting for something
that I believed in.

13:22.401 --> 13:25.199
Animals are dying
in laboratories across the country.

13:25.905 --> 13:29.363
Honey, that may very well be.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.533
But there are other ways
of expressing your opinion

13:31.710 --> 13:35.646
than breaking and entering with
the intent to destroy federal property.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.581
You know, you guys were involved
in antiwar demonstrations.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.615
And Brandon led a walkout
on the school board.

13:41.787 --> 13:42.981
Nobody said anything to him.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.816
Honey,
it was an entirely different matter.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.390
Why? Because you agreed with him?
Because he wasn't arrested?

13:47.560 --> 13:48.822
No.

13:48.994 --> 13:52.020
The fact that you were arrested
is not the issue here.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.666
What matters
is what you were arrested for.

13:54.834 --> 13:59.794
What Brandon did,
what your mother and I did years ago,

13:59.972 --> 14:02.770
was nonviolent protest.

14:03.209 --> 14:05.700
But destroying
a university laboratory?

14:05.878 --> 14:07.573
Somebody had to stand up, Dad.

14:08.380 --> 14:12.373
Animals are being tortured
and mutilated for no reason at all.

14:12.551 --> 14:15.384
I thought I could make a difference.
I don't know what else to say.

14:15.554 --> 14:19.149
Brenda, you're 19 years old.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.054
It's time you started to get
a firmer grasp

14:21.227 --> 14:23.161
on the consequences
of your actions.

14:24.496 --> 14:26.225
Do you understand
that you now have

14:26.398 --> 14:28.423
an arrest record
for the rest of your life?

14:28.601 --> 14:30.364
Do you have any idea
what you're about to face

14:30.536 --> 14:32.231
or what this family
is about to go through?

14:32.404 --> 14:35.498
I know. And I'm sorry.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.736
Dad, I'm exhausted
and I need a bath.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.974
All I can smell
is the inside of that jail, okay?

14:46.285 --> 14:51.222
All right. Go up to your room.
We'll talk later.

15:02.868 --> 15:05.063
What are we gonna do with her?

15:05.237 --> 15:09.105
Look, maybe a night in jail
was enough punishment.

15:09.275 --> 15:13.302
- It must have been awful for her.
- Maybe it was.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.141
But this may turn out to be
a lot more than a night in jail.

15:16.315 --> 15:21.548
This is going to trial. It's gonna cost us
a fortune. And worse...

15:23.355 --> 15:24.754
...she could be found guilty.

15:33.132 --> 15:36.363
So how's the food in prison
these days?

15:36.535 --> 15:39.595
- It isn't funny, Brandon.
- I know.

15:40.806 --> 15:43.707
I'm not even gonna ask you
how you got into all this.

15:44.243 --> 15:45.471
Thanks.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.976
You must have really believed
in what you were doing.

15:48.147 --> 15:50.012
Yeah, I did.

15:51.216 --> 15:54.310
- I don't wanna go to jail.
- I know.

15:55.254 --> 15:56.687
What am I gonna do?

15:59.625 --> 16:00.990
Oh, my God, Andrea.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.720
- What's Andrea got to do with all this?
- It was her lab.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.865
I've gotta talk to her. I don't want her
to hear this from anyone but me.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.263
Brandon, there's someone here
to see you.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.870
Yeah, I'll be right down, Mom.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.697
Listen.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.405
Dad got you a great lawyer.

16:19.211 --> 16:20.235
It's gonna be okay.

16:21.513 --> 16:24.971
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

16:31.857 --> 16:35.293
- Nice to meet you, Josh.
- You too, Mrs. Walsh.

16:36.228 --> 16:38.196
What's this, Richland?
A little social call?

16:38.364 --> 16:40.491
I heard your sister got arrested
last night.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.759
Brenda's upstairs
if you'd like to talk to her.

16:42.935 --> 16:46.132
I could have her come down, that way
she could slam the door in your face.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.432
Actually, I'm just wrapping up
my piece about you.

16:48.607 --> 16:51.235
Well, in case you hadn't noticed,
this isn't exactly a good time.

16:51.410 --> 16:52.877
Look, I put the story to bed tonight.

16:53.045 --> 16:55.070
I just had a couple
more questions, okay?

17:07.492 --> 17:09.893
How long have you and Lucinda
Nicholson been having an affair?

17:10.061 --> 17:12.859
- You're still chewing on that old shoe?
- I call it tenacity.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.829
- I call it libel.
- Is that a denial?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.332
- You really wanna go to war with me?
- Oh, please.

17:17.502 --> 17:21.064
<i>As far as the Condor's concerned,
you're fair game.</i>

17:21.240 --> 17:22.502
Besides, I know it's the truth.

17:22.974 --> 17:25.603
- Then what do you need me for?
- Well, technically, nothing.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.269
But there's still a few loose ends,

17:28.446 --> 17:30.608
like having Kelly Taylor pretend
she was your girlfriend

17:30.783 --> 17:33.684
at all of those task-force dinners.
What was that all about?

17:33.852 --> 17:36.946
You know what, Josh?
I finally understand this.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.885
You're not a reporter
digging for a story.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.289
- This is personal, isn't it?
- Everything's personal, Walsh.

17:42.461 --> 17:43.587
Everything that matters.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.656
Is this blackmail?

17:46.432 --> 17:51.734
Okay, you're a pretty smart guy.
Let's see how smart.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.303
Here's the deal.

17:53.972 --> 17:56.668
You back me
for student body president next year,

17:56.842 --> 17:57.900
I won't move the story.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.369
No deal, Richland.

18:01.547 --> 18:03.981
You wanna run this crap,
you go right ahead.

18:04.149 --> 18:07.175
But just know something.
I'll get you.

18:08.353 --> 18:09.479
I'm quaking.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.523
Josh, can I get you something?
A cup of coffee?

18:12.691 --> 18:17.128
- No, Mom. Josh was just leaving.
- Thanks, anyway. I was just leaving.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.737
Hey, son. Why don't you rotate
your right hand a little bit?

18:28.907 --> 18:30.807
Look at your feet.
Where are you aiming the ball?

18:30.976 --> 18:34.742
- The greens are straight out that way.
- Maybe you wanna hit it for him.

18:34.913 --> 18:37.074
You know, Dad,
that's why I gave up this game of golf.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.513
Because you don't let up on me.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.550
I'm sorry, son. Do it your way.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.731
Now, that's what I call
fine tournament playing.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.663
If you would just stop
and let me concentrate,

18:56.835 --> 18:58.803
maybe I'd have a chance
at a decent shot.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.566
Could you guys work out
your family problems some other time?

19:03.008 --> 19:05.841
- We've got a tournament to win.
- Yeah, don't count on it, Barry.

19:06.011 --> 19:07.911
Don't count on it.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.782
- Look and learn.
- Just hit it.

19:17.923 --> 19:18.947
Damn.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.024
- That was a hell of a drive.
- Yeah.

19:21.593 --> 19:24.619
You got
some kind of secret weapon?

19:24.796 --> 19:27.196
Yeah. Something like that.

19:27.366 --> 19:30.028
I haven't seen you hit
a shot like that in years.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.693
Sonny boy,
you haven't seen anything yet.

19:34.973 --> 19:36.235
- Good hit, son.
- Good hit.

19:36.408 --> 19:38.035
Nice shot.

19:42.814 --> 19:45.282
Brandon, what brings you here?
I thought you were avoiding me.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.475
What'd you tell Richland about us?

19:47.653 --> 19:49.018
Nothing.
What are you talking about?

19:49.188 --> 19:52.624
Well, he came by my house today
claiming to know everything about us.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.191
Richland doesn't know a thing.
He was on a fishing expedition.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.555
I don't think so. I think he knows.

19:57.729 --> 20:00.220
Dylan and Kelly didn't tell him,
and my sister certainly didn't,

20:00.399 --> 20:02.424
so that just leaves you.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.330
Now, why would I do
something like that?

20:04.503 --> 20:07.199
Oh, I don't know. You got your grant
to do your little movie.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.068
You're leaving C.U.,
it doesn't matter to you anymore.

20:10.242 --> 20:13.211
- I'm not out to hurt you, Brandon.
- I wish I could believe you, Lucinda,

20:13.378 --> 20:14.777
but I don't.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.312
That's your problem.

20:16.481 --> 20:19.279
I do have feelings for you, Brandon.

20:19.818 --> 20:23.219
- Even if you can't understand that.
- I can't even begin to understand that.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.555
You know, this is where it all began.

20:29.261 --> 20:30.694
It's too bad we can't start over.

20:31.296 --> 20:35.630
You could spot me, I could spot you,
go for coffee.

20:35.801 --> 20:38.201
- Who knows where it might lead.
- It wouldn't lead anywhere.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.199
Okay, well, then,
I guess this is goodbye.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.103
Yes, it is.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.242
Hey, Brandon.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.577
How about one last kiss
for old time's sake, huh?

20:56.788 --> 20:58.483
Who'd you sleep with
to get your grant?

20:59.024 --> 21:01.959
- Have a nice life, Brandon.
- Yeah, you too.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.796
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:09.968 --> 21:12.198
- Can we come in?
- Sure.

21:13.772 --> 21:18.436
So did you hear what your friends did
at the lab last night?

21:19.244 --> 21:20.939
Yeah, that's why we're here.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.945
Look, if you guys came
to rehash old arguments,

21:24.116 --> 21:25.310
I'm far too exhausted for that.

21:25.484 --> 21:28.351
I've been cleaning up the lab
all morning.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.387
I didn't come here
to argue with you, Andrea.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.022
I came here to apologize.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.387
Brenda, you're not responsible
for what a few extremists did.

21:39.431 --> 21:40.455
Yes, I am.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.326
I was one of those extremists.

21:47.839 --> 21:49.170
You were what?

21:49.341 --> 21:53.437
Look, Andrea, I was there.
I got arrested last night.

21:56.281 --> 21:58.408
Brenda, how could you do
something like that?

21:58.583 --> 22:00.813
Andrea, you don't understand.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.079
You can't know how horrible it was
to watch Rocky die.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.587
It happened because
of things that went on in that building.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.782
It's the same building
that your laboratory's in.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.824
Andrea, I didn't do it
out of meanness.

22:09.995 --> 22:13.089
I did it because I thought that I could
save some of those animals' lives.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.893
- And I'm sorry if it hurt you.
- Sorry?

22:16.068 --> 22:17.626
That has nothing to do with me.

22:18.603 --> 22:21.504
Do you realize how many years
of research has been destroyed?

22:22.207 --> 22:23.902
How many babies' lives
could have been saved

22:24.076 --> 22:27.045
if we had known how suddenly
an infant dies in its crib?

22:27.212 --> 22:29.442
Andrea, I know this may be
the end of our friendship,

22:29.614 --> 22:30.740
but you've got to believe me.

22:30.916 --> 22:33.180
I didn't know it was your lab
until it was too late.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.343
- We were going down the hall...
- Brenda.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.647
- I was supposed to stand lookout.
- Brenda...

22:37.823 --> 22:40.291
When they went to Lab 33,
I tried to stop them but I couldn't...

22:40.459 --> 22:42.290
- Listen, Brenda...
- Jesse, I can handle this...

22:42.461 --> 22:45.624
No, no, you can't. The last thing
you and I need is to be pulled into this,

22:45.797 --> 22:47.697
but if we talk to Brenda,
we might be.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.130
- I don't understand.
- I don't wanna know what happened.

22:50.302 --> 22:51.667
I don't want Andrea to know either,

22:51.837 --> 22:53.702
because it makes us
accessories after the fact.

22:53.872 --> 22:54.998
That's ridiculous.

22:55.173 --> 22:57.505
Do you want me to go and get
the book on criminal procedure?

22:58.443 --> 23:00.138
I can't tell you
what to do with your life,

23:00.312 --> 23:02.507
but I don't think
you wanna be subpoenaed either.

23:02.748 --> 23:05.308
- Are you serious?
- Yes. Yes, I'm very serious.

23:18.363 --> 23:21.799
You know,
Jesse got me pretty scared.

23:21.967 --> 23:23.662
I mean, he acted
like I was a real criminal.

23:23.835 --> 23:26.303
Oh, he's just being paranoid.
You know how lawyers get.

23:27.272 --> 23:29.035
Well, do you want me to come in
with you?

23:29.207 --> 23:30.799
Does that mean
you're still talking to me?

23:30.976 --> 23:35.242
Of course I'm still talking to you.
Just not about this.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.739
Thanks,
you're a good friend, Donna.

23:37.916 --> 23:41.875
But no, you better not. It's pretty hairy
at Casa Walsh these days.

23:42.053 --> 23:43.816
Well, I can take it,
if you need the company.

23:43.989 --> 23:46.890
No, it's okay.
In fact, I probably need to be alone.

23:47.058 --> 23:50.619
I'm gonna take a walk.
Clear my head, think about all this.

23:50.796 --> 23:53.196
- I'll call you later, okay?
- Thanks.

24:11.483 --> 24:13.815
How long would it be before
this would actually go to trial?

24:15.420 --> 24:17.115
I understand.

24:18.256 --> 24:19.985
Yeah, we'll be there.

24:20.492 --> 24:23.427
Thanks for all your help. Bye.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.790
Was that the lawyer?

24:26.965 --> 24:28.830
The very expensive lawyer,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.766
who made sure he let me know
that there was no guarantees.

24:33.538 --> 24:34.903
What's gonna happen to her, Dad?

24:35.073 --> 24:38.440
Well, if Brenda's very lucky,
she won't go to jail.

24:40.846 --> 24:43.747
I don't know how I managed to raise
two kids who are so different.

24:44.649 --> 24:48.881
- Maybe we're not so different.
- Believe me, you're different.

24:49.187 --> 24:53.146
I look at you and I'm so proud
of what you've accomplished.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.555
You're bright, you're talented,

24:55.727 --> 24:59.219
and now that you're on the task force,
people are really starting to take notice.

24:59.764 --> 25:02.096
You're gonna be quite a force
to be reckoned with, Brandon.

25:03.235 --> 25:06.796
Listen, I appreciate the confidence
you have in me and everything,

25:06.972 --> 25:09.702
and I know this is probably
the last thing you need

25:09.875 --> 25:11.342
on your plate right now.

25:12.143 --> 25:15.704
- What's wrong?
- There's a guy at school.

25:15.881 --> 25:19.408
A junior.
He writes for the newspaper,

25:19.584 --> 25:21.575
and he's been doing
a little digging about me.

25:23.488 --> 25:26.184
What skeletons could he possibly find
in your closet?

25:26.625 --> 25:28.149
The female kind.

25:29.628 --> 25:30.652
What's wrong with that?

25:30.829 --> 25:34.128
- You're 19, you're single...
- And she's 26 and married.

25:34.900 --> 25:35.924
I see.

25:36.101 --> 25:39.901
Actually, if you wanna get technical
about it, she got divorced,

25:40.305 --> 25:42.830
but that's still not the worst part.

25:43.008 --> 25:46.842
Okay, go ahead, hit me with it.
Nothing could shock me now.

25:48.313 --> 25:49.678
She's on the faculty.

25:50.515 --> 25:52.142
I'm shocked.

25:52.317 --> 25:54.308
- Is this still going on?
- No.

25:54.486 --> 25:57.546
And she's leaving the school,
but it still could get pretty ugly.

25:58.156 --> 25:59.748
I just wanted you
to hear it from me first

25:59.925 --> 26:02.655
<i>before the story comes out
in the Condor tomorrow</i>

26:02.827 --> 26:05.887
and my political career
comes to a grinding halt.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.133
Well, I've gotta hand it to you,
Brandon.

26:10.302 --> 26:14.329
I didn't think anything could possibly
take my mind of Brenda this afternoon,

26:14.506 --> 26:15.632
but you did it.

26:19.077 --> 26:22.410
All right, all right, Barry.
It's almost over.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.071
Everything
but the cheers of the crowd.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.184
Old Rush Sanders is back on top.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.786
You only have a one-stroke lead,
Rush.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.415
Watch poetry in motion.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.821
All right, here we go.

26:36.628 --> 26:39.461
- Is there a problem?
- I think I got a cut from my five iron.

26:39.631 --> 26:42.623
- I got a ball.
- I got another one in my bag.

26:42.801 --> 26:44.234
We're both hitting Titleists.

26:44.402 --> 26:46.802
I've got one in my bag, it's okay.

26:49.541 --> 26:50.565
Here we go.

26:50.742 --> 26:52.642
What kind of stunt
are you trying to pull?

26:52.811 --> 26:54.039
What are you talking about?

26:54.212 --> 26:56.339
Well, you're too smart
to do something they could spot,

26:56.514 --> 26:58.345
so it must be something really good.

26:58.516 --> 27:00.609
- Now, what is it?
- Keep your voice down.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.888
Okay, okay.

27:06.491 --> 27:07.515
Keep yourself in control.

27:07.692 --> 27:11.355
I got a little contraption in the mail,
that's all. It's no big deal.

27:11.529 --> 27:13.690
You plug it in overnight,
you put your golf balls in it,

27:13.865 --> 27:16.265
it juices up the insides a little bit,
that's all.

27:16.434 --> 27:18.129
That's how you've been getting
the distance?

27:18.303 --> 27:20.931
- It's no big deal.
- What do you mean? That's cheating.

27:21.106 --> 27:23.973
Will you...? Keep your voice down.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.133
And who are you to tell me
about cheating?

27:27.012 --> 27:29.810
Maybe if you played a little better,
I wouldn't have to do it.

27:31.216 --> 27:33.150
So this is my fault, huh?

27:34.986 --> 27:39.047
How about we debate morality later?

27:39.891 --> 27:41.825
We've got a tournament to win.

27:42.761 --> 27:44.456
Let's have fun.

27:45.930 --> 27:47.898
You wanna have fun?

27:48.800 --> 27:53.260
Okay. All right, we'll have some fun.

27:56.241 --> 27:58.675
I'm exhausted.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.368
You have only one person
to thank for that.

28:01.546 --> 28:03.605
Don't start.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.548
Okay, I won't.

28:11.956 --> 28:16.120
- Is that better?
- I don't know, try again.

28:21.232 --> 28:25.225
- Much better.
- Suddenly, you don't seem so sleepy.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.500
Go away.

28:32.911 --> 28:36.108
- Who is it?
- Brenda.

28:38.583 --> 28:40.141
Perfect.

28:40.318 --> 28:43.185
You know what, seriously, Donna says
we shouldn't even be talking to her.

28:43.788 --> 28:44.812
Why not?

28:44.989 --> 28:47.685
Jesse says that if Brenda tells us
anything about what happened,

28:47.859 --> 28:48.883
we could be subpoenaed.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.620
Typical lawyer talk, okay?
That's ridiculous.

28:55.700 --> 28:59.101
- Hi. I'm sorry to barge in.
- No, come on.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.504
I just wanted to say thank you.
To both of you.

29:04.676 --> 29:05.870
We didn't really do that much.

29:06.044 --> 29:09.138
I'm just sorry
we had to tell your parents.

29:09.314 --> 29:11.145
No, I was just being stupid.

29:11.316 --> 29:14.479
I don't know how I thought
that I could keep that a secret.

29:14.819 --> 29:18.448
- You okay?
- Yeah, a little scared.

29:18.623 --> 29:20.113
One night in jail
was definitely enough

29:20.291 --> 29:22.953
to make me realize
I don't wanna go back.

29:23.128 --> 29:24.755
You should have thought
of that before.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.226
- Kel.
- What?

29:26.865 --> 29:29.231
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you expect from me.

29:29.734 --> 29:31.634
- What about friendship?
- What about friendship?

29:31.803 --> 29:35.136
How far is that supposed to take us?
What, do you just expect us all

29:35.306 --> 29:37.604
to jump in the jail cell with you,
keep you company?

29:37.776 --> 29:38.902
What is your problem?

29:39.077 --> 29:41.375
You wanna know
what my problem is?

29:42.347 --> 29:44.372
I am sick and tired of stepping aside

29:44.549 --> 29:47.040
every time Brenda comes running
to you with another crisis.

29:47.986 --> 29:49.886
Every time you call, he runs.

29:50.054 --> 29:52.921
Whether it's Palm Springs
in the middle of the night or jail.

29:53.091 --> 29:57.221
Wherever it is, he runs.
He's not your boyfriend anymore.

29:57.395 --> 29:59.329
And obviously,
you're not my friend anymore.

30:03.334 --> 30:05.529
Thanks again, Dylan. Bye.

30:14.612 --> 30:17.775
- What?
- You got lousy timing.

30:32.630 --> 30:35.155
- Good putt, Barry, good putt.
- Thank you.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.029
But I don't think
it's gonna be good enough.

30:38.203 --> 30:41.536
This one's going in. Left to right.

30:42.707 --> 30:44.766
Wanna make a side bet?

30:55.753 --> 30:57.084
Yes. Yes.

30:57.255 --> 30:59.951
Looks like you're finally gonna put
the Larsons away this year, Rush.

31:00.124 --> 31:02.251
That's the object of it, Tom.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.322
Don't panic, it's an easy putt.

31:08.499 --> 31:10.330
Come on, Barry,
stop trying to psyche him out.

31:10.501 --> 31:12.992
This is an easy one, it's a gimme.

31:25.283 --> 31:26.978
Will guys will excuse us
for a minute?

31:29.053 --> 31:32.022
Excuse me.
What the hell was that all about?

31:32.190 --> 31:35.455
- I missed the ball. What's...?
- You missed on purpose.

31:35.627 --> 31:38.357
I told you,
I wasn't gonna play by your rules.

31:38.529 --> 31:39.826
You wanna throw away the game?

31:40.465 --> 31:42.296
Why did you do it?

31:42.467 --> 31:45.664
It's a lousy club tournament.
The trophy isn't even sterling silver.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.828
Oh, my God.

31:48.006 --> 31:49.803
Is that what you think it is?
The damn trophy?

31:50.241 --> 31:53.074
You always wanna be a loser, son?
You were a loser when you were a kid,

31:53.244 --> 31:54.541
you wanna be one
when you grow up?

31:54.712 --> 31:58.148
Nope, you can't get me like that
anymore, Dad. I just don't buy it.

31:58.316 --> 31:59.476
I'm not a loser.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.341
You're a horse's ass.

32:02.353 --> 32:03.752
Dad.

32:04.989 --> 32:08.652
That putt is a cinch.
The way I figure it, I got a choice.

32:08.826 --> 32:10.794
Well, actually, you've got a choice.

32:10.962 --> 32:13.522
You throw away the super balls,
play out the rest fair and square,

32:13.698 --> 32:16.792
I'll sink that putt
and put us in sudden death.

32:16.968 --> 32:21.337
Or I'll screw it up.
I'll throw it away. We'll lose, Dad.

32:25.843 --> 32:28.107
Sink the putt.

32:43.428 --> 32:45.157
Sudden death.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.368
Where have you been?

32:53.171 --> 32:55.162
I walked over to Dylan's.
Why? What's wrong?

32:55.340 --> 32:57.831
- Your attorney called.
- The FBI wants to see you.

32:58.009 --> 33:00.341
Now, what?
I mean, what do they want with me?

33:00.511 --> 33:03.446
I don't know, but I suggest
we don't keep them waiting.

33:11.622 --> 33:14.523
You've been playing pretty good golf
without your hot little helpers, Dad.

33:14.692 --> 33:17.525
- Will you get off my back?
- Oh, come on.

33:17.695 --> 33:20.493
It's not that bad,
playing golf by the rules, is it?

33:20.665 --> 33:23.725
Tell me something,
when did you get so squeaky clean?

33:24.502 --> 33:26.697
Since I discovered
what a louse you were.

33:28.272 --> 33:29.398
I'm gonna tell you something.

33:31.075 --> 33:33.134
I never did anything like this before.

33:33.311 --> 33:36.576
Oh, please, you gotta be kidding me.
You telling me you got where you are

33:36.748 --> 33:38.340
by reciting the Boy Scout code
to people?

33:38.516 --> 33:41.451
I'm trying to tell you that in business,
people go for your throats.

33:41.619 --> 33:44.782
It's dog eat dog. You wanna stay
on top, you do what you have to do.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.514
The golf course
is something different.

33:46.991 --> 33:49.289
The golf course to me
is my field of honor.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.394
I never did anything like this before.

33:52.397 --> 33:53.694
Then why did you do it this time?

33:56.434 --> 33:59.335
Because I'm 54 years old.

33:59.670 --> 34:02.639
And I was club champ
four years straight.

34:03.541 --> 34:08.308
I wanted to feel one more time
what it was like to be back on top.

34:10.114 --> 34:12.139
One lousy time.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.157
Okay.

34:21.759 --> 34:23.522
I guess I can win this tournament
for you.

34:25.596 --> 34:27.291
Since you've been
such a good little boy.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.300
You got any last-minute advice?

34:32.270 --> 34:35.864
No. Go ahead and do it.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.431
You're a better golfer now
than I ever was.

34:41.145 --> 34:42.942
I'll even tend the flag for you.

34:44.882 --> 34:46.782
Come on, you can do it.

34:54.992 --> 34:58.052
- Pay attention.
- Good luck.

34:58.729 --> 35:00.356
Okay, sonny boy, give it a go.

35:33.931 --> 35:35.228
I don't believe it.

35:36.067 --> 35:38.467
I don't believe it, what a putt.
Did you see that, Larson?

35:38.636 --> 35:40.661
That's my boy, that's my boy.

35:40.838 --> 35:44.672
Well, congratulations, Rush.
You finally beat me.

35:44.842 --> 35:46.366
- Yeah, well,
- Good job.

35:46.544 --> 35:48.375
All due to my secret weapon
over here.

35:49.347 --> 35:52.908
And if he'd allow me,
I would like to buy him a beer.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.049
- Okay.
- See you, guys.

35:58.789 --> 36:00.689
I can't believe it.

36:03.794 --> 36:06.194
Tom, we've been waiting here
for 20 minutes.

36:06.364 --> 36:09.299
I don't know anything more
than I told you on the phone.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.995
Brenda, let me do
most of the talking here.

36:13.638 --> 36:18.041
But anything they ask,
answer them honestly and directly.

36:19.110 --> 36:22.307
- I will...
- I feel a but coming on.

36:22.747 --> 36:26.444
It's just that I know I got caught up
with a bunch of extremists.

36:26.951 --> 36:29.545
And I know what we did was wrong.

36:30.154 --> 36:31.883
But I won't apologize for standing up

36:32.056 --> 36:34.115
- for the ethical treatment of animals.
- Brenda...

36:34.292 --> 36:36.920
I don't think the FBI
is looking for an apology, Brenda.

36:37.094 --> 36:40.257
Tell them we'll meet in your office
at 4.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.522
Hello, Brenda.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.930
- Jon, what are you doing here?
- I work here.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.500
Federal agent.

36:47.805 --> 36:50.296
Mr. And Mrs. Walsh, hello.

36:50.474 --> 36:52.635
So you were in on it
the whole time.

36:52.810 --> 36:56.644
Yeah. I've been working undercover
at the university for a while.

36:56.814 --> 37:00.147
I infiltrated this group
almost six months ago.

37:00.318 --> 37:02.479
We've been working a long time
to build the kind of case

37:02.653 --> 37:03.847
that we think we now have.

37:05.022 --> 37:07.855
I'm assuming we're here because
you'd like my client's cooperation

37:08.025 --> 37:10.892
- in this matter.
- That's right, counselor.

37:15.099 --> 37:18.899
Look, we're not after you, Brenda.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.834
You got mixed up in all of this
at the last minute, I know that.

37:22.006 --> 37:26.102
And I know that you tried to stop
what went down.

37:26.277 --> 37:27.904
Now, the way I see this,

37:28.079 --> 37:31.606
you are either gonna do hard time
or no time.

37:32.216 --> 37:34.446
This is your choice.

37:38.055 --> 37:40.319
Okay, here's the deal.

37:40.491 --> 37:45.053
We will drop charges against Brenda
if she's willing to cooperate.

37:45.229 --> 37:47.720
- I am.
- Brenda, wait.

37:48.399 --> 37:50.196
I'm only letting my client testify

37:50.368 --> 37:53.360
if you grant her
immunity and protection.

37:53.537 --> 37:56.700
Well, fortunately, she'll probably never
even have to take the witness stand.

37:58.209 --> 38:00.609
Look, all we want from Brenda
is an affidavit

38:00.778 --> 38:03.838
that will corroborate
any pertinent testimony.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.313
That will be submitted to the grand jury
as sealed evidence

38:06.484 --> 38:09.681
and hopefully, you will never
have to hear about this again.

38:09.854 --> 38:11.014
And this will all be over?

38:11.188 --> 38:13.656
Well, if everything goes
according to Hoyle, yes.

38:14.191 --> 38:16.523
For you, this will all be over.

38:17.361 --> 38:19.295
That's a relief.

38:26.170 --> 38:29.071
- Donna, are you home?
- Yeah.

38:31.208 --> 38:32.903
- Hi, guys. What's up?
- Hey.

38:33.077 --> 38:35.307
Well, we have a little surprise
for you.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.071
- What?
- It's in the box.

38:38.015 --> 38:39.778
What's going on here?

38:39.950 --> 38:41.941
Well, we brought
something home to you

38:42.119 --> 38:43.984
that we hoped would cheer you up.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.782
We know how much
you loved Rocky.

38:46.524 --> 38:47.548
You didn't.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.555
It's a puppy.

38:54.732 --> 38:58.031
Oh, hi. Oh, he's so cute.

38:58.769 --> 39:02.432
Oh, you're adorable.
Oh, thank you guys so much.

39:02.606 --> 39:04.870
Oh, hi. Where'd you get him from?

39:05.042 --> 39:08.205
Well, I got him from the lab.
He was one of the lucky ones.

39:08.379 --> 39:11.576
Is he all right? I mean, they didn't do
anything to him, did they?

39:11.749 --> 39:14.582
Absolutely not. I checked it out.
He's in perfect health.

39:16.220 --> 39:20.122
Oh, I love you.
Well, what do we call him?

39:20.291 --> 39:24.660
- Well, we already thought of that.
- What else but Rocky Two?

39:25.262 --> 39:30.165
Hi, Rocky Two.
Hi, that's your name. Hi.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.672
Hey.

39:43.714 --> 39:46.342
Well? What do you think?

39:46.517 --> 39:48.951
Did one of the advisers
blue-pencil your copy?

39:49.120 --> 39:52.521
That's gratitude. What's the matter?
Didn't I praise you enough?

39:52.690 --> 39:55.090
It was a great piece. I appreciate it.

39:55.259 --> 39:57.159
But I thought you were gonna try
to bury me, man.

39:57.328 --> 40:00.456
- What happened?
- Well, I did some thinking.

40:00.631 --> 40:03.293
- And you know what I came up with?
- What?

40:04.568 --> 40:07.036
I figured out that we're the same,
you and I.

40:07.204 --> 40:11.641
We're, you know, in a snake pit.
And we're all snakes.

40:11.809 --> 40:13.709
And since when do snakes
have scruples?

40:15.212 --> 40:16.941
I don't know.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.077
I wouldn't call them scruples.

40:20.785 --> 40:24.551
I just figured if you had the integrity
to stand up to me,

40:24.722 --> 40:28.317
you must be a pretty honest guy.
I couldn't trash that.

40:29.527 --> 40:31.495
Kind of circular logic, isn't it,
Richland?

40:32.096 --> 40:34.724
It's politics, buddy. It's politics.

40:34.899 --> 40:36.992
So maybe the Poli Sci Department
should offer a course

40:37.168 --> 40:39.227
- in scandal control.
- Yeah.

40:39.403 --> 40:41.166
You and I would be
the first two to show up.

40:41.338 --> 40:43.932
Oh, you got a few skeletons
in the old closet of yours

40:44.108 --> 40:45.439
I don't know about, Josh?

40:46.777 --> 40:47.971
Who doesn't?

40:48.546 --> 40:49.979
You know, you play your cards right,

40:50.147 --> 40:52.308
I just might back
that campaign of yours after all.

40:52.483 --> 40:54.849
Okay, good.

40:55.219 --> 40:58.677
- Well, let me know.
- I will.

41:04.161 --> 41:05.719
I did what I had to do, all right?

41:05.896 --> 41:08.296
It had nothing to do
with the fact it was Brenda.

41:08.466 --> 41:12.800
- You're just everybody's best friend.
- I said I was sorry, get off it.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.631
I'm either gonna be
number one in your life

41:14.805 --> 41:17.103
or I'm not gonna be in your life.

41:21.345 --> 41:26.146
Here you go, Rocky.
Here you go, buddy. Here you go.

41:26.317 --> 41:29.775
Hey, buddy, what's this?
What's that? Oh, yeah.

41:29.954 --> 41:32.479
- He's got a great appetite.
- He sure does.

41:32.656 --> 41:35.284
- Oh, man.
- Hi, guys.

41:35.459 --> 41:37.620
Kel, meet the newest member
of the family, Rocky Two.

41:37.795 --> 41:40.559
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

41:40.731 --> 41:42.528
Dylan, you want a new puppy?

41:42.700 --> 41:45.225
He can fetch you the newspaper,
your slippers, anything you want.

41:45.402 --> 41:47.666
I've had about all the domestic bliss
I can handle.

41:52.343 --> 41:53.867
- Bren.
- Hey, Bren.

41:56.413 --> 41:57.778
Don't worry.

41:57.948 --> 41:59.643
All the charges
have been dropped against me

41:59.817 --> 42:01.512
and I'm cooperating with the FBI.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.653
So you guys don't need to be afraid
to talk to me.

42:06.390 --> 42:09.416
- Brenda, sit down.
- No. I'm not staying.

42:11.495 --> 42:12.962
Look, I just wanted to say I'm sorry

42:13.130 --> 42:15.155
if I put any of you
in an uncomfortable position.

42:16.300 --> 42:19.167
I know that you had to look out
for yourselves.

42:19.336 --> 42:22.464
And I know that some things stretch
the boundaries of friendship.

42:23.307 --> 42:26.504
But I hope none of you ever feel
as alone as I have felt.

42:27.778 --> 42:29.575
Bren, wait.

42:33.150 --> 42:36.176
- I'll go talk to her.
- No, I will.

42:44.428 --> 42:45.952
Brenda.

42:47.031 --> 42:48.692
You okay?

42:50.234 --> 42:52.634
No, I feel terrible, Kelly.

42:54.939 --> 42:57.134
I feel like I don't have
a friend in the world.

42:58.509 --> 43:02.001
Yes, you do. We're all your friends.
Including me.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.143
Well, you said
some pretty awful things.

43:06.750 --> 43:09.344
I know. I'm sorry.

43:10.321 --> 43:13.552
The green monster rears its head
at really weird times.

43:15.225 --> 43:17.819
You were jealous of me? Why?
I mean, you have Dylan.

43:19.229 --> 43:22.130
Something tells me
I won't have him forever.

43:22.299 --> 43:24.460
And I can't help but think
that you'll always be the one

43:24.635 --> 43:27.195
he'll remember
as the great love of his life.

43:30.708 --> 43:33.643
Well, I don't know if that's true,

43:34.111 --> 43:36.739
but I've been jealous of you
ever since I moved here.

43:37.848 --> 43:39.975
Well, maybe we're even.

43:41.652 --> 43:43.347
Brenda, I...

43:44.288 --> 43:46.381
I know I was a bitch
right when you needed me the most

43:46.557 --> 43:48.184
and I really feel bad.

43:48.926 --> 43:49.950
Good.

43:51.328 --> 43:54.991
Brenda. You better come in.
Your veggie burger's getting cold.

43:55.165 --> 43:56.530
What veggie burger?

43:56.934 --> 43:58.094
The one I ordered for you.

43:59.503 --> 44:00.936
You are a vegetarian, aren't you?

44:02.773 --> 44:05.241
- Aren't you?
- Yes.

44:11.615 --> 44:14.243
- To our favorite felon.
- Yeah, do me a favor, Bren.

44:14.418 --> 44:16.477
Next time you get arrested,
do it at a decent hour.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.884
There isn't gonna be a next time,
isn't that right, Bren?

44:19.456 --> 44:21.219
You know, when I spent that night
behind bars,

44:21.392 --> 44:24.361
I kept thinking if I had only one wish,
it would be to go home.

44:27.431 --> 44:29.160
- It's good to be home.
- Hear, hear.
