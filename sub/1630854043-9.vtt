12:59.363 --> 13:01.949
- It appears almost verbatim
in a LiveJournal

13:01.949 --> 13:03.408
posted two years ago.

13:03.992 --> 13:07.454
I didn't want to, but I am required
to report any hits

13:07.454 --> 13:09.081
to the student disciplinary council.

13:09.581 --> 13:12.000
Baird takes plagiarism really seriously.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.419
- I did not plagiarize that, I swear.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.380
It's from my LiveJournal.

13:16.380 --> 13:20.467
I, I... I had it in high school,
that's when I wrote it.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.095
You can't plagiarize yourself, can you?

13:24.012 --> 13:25.138
- Can you prove you wrote it?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.141
- It's an anonymous thing.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.977
I can, I can try to get the login info,

13:29.977 --> 13:32.646
but I don't even have
that email address anymore.

13:33.272 --> 13:35.232
- I'm afraid I can't help you
with no proof.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.234
I want to help you, but my hands are tied.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.068
- No, I can prove it.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.696
I, I, I promise
I can prove that it's mine.

13:40.696 --> 13:41.530
- How?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.993
- Because its, it's true, it's all true.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.703
I-- it's not fiction.

13:47.703 --> 13:50.539
I was just writing about my life, and...

13:52.708 --> 13:55.669
and all that stuff actually
really happened to me.

13:58.172 --> 14:01.216
- If it's true, I'm sorry
that happened to you.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.636
But the only way I can see out of this

14:04.636 --> 14:07.264
is if you can actually prove
the LiveJournal is yours.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.558
Can you do that?

14:11.977 --> 14:12.811

14:13.312 --> 14:14.730
You said your mom did something shitty,

14:14.730 --> 14:16.982

14:30.746 --> 14:32.122

14:32.122 --> 14:33.207
- When I told Max about it,

14:33.207 --> 14:36.418
he just told me I was depressed.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.343
- So you already talked to Max about this?

14:45.260 --> 14:48.805
- Yeah, yeah, I did,
but it was a huge mistake.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.349

14:50.349 --> 14:53.769

15:03.195 --> 15:05.280

anyone can fix this.

You're not getting suspended over this.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.085

15:18.085 --> 15:19.670
Nobody else knows about this.

15:19.670 --> 15:21.004
- Your mom knows about it.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.632
You call her, you tell her
to come to the school

15:23.632 --> 15:25.384
and talk to your professor
and tell her it's true.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.886
The story's mostly about her.

15:27.886 --> 15:28.971
- No, I can't do that.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.350
- Give me one reason why you shouldn't?

15:33.350 --> 15:34.893
- Because it would destroy her.

15:34.893 --> 15:37.771
She's-- she'd be humiliated.

15:37.771 --> 15:41.191
You do not know her,
she's, she's not a strong person.

15:41.191 --> 15:42.651
- And that's your fault?

15:43.819 --> 15:46.238
Did someone force her to go fuck some dude

15:46.238 --> 15:48.156
while your dad died right in front of you?

15:49.408 --> 15:51.159
She brought this on herself.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.203
It's not on you to pay for it.

that's what I should do?

16:02.671 --> 16:04.089
You think that'll help?

16:04.089 --> 16:05.799
- Yes, I do.

16:09.595 --> 16:11.805
I mean, fuck, you can't
get yourself suspended

16:11.805 --> 16:13.473
to avoid hurting her feelings.

I don't think about it much.
