00:23.215 --> 00:25.183
What does it look like to you?

00:27.053 --> 00:29.621
Dog piss?

00:29.622 --> 00:32.057
Lamp oil.

00:32.058 --> 00:34.025
Sewage.

00:35.561 --> 00:38.162
Trouble is, our patient here, Mr. Ludd,

00:38.297 --> 00:41.532
has probably, at one time or
another, drank all those substances.

00:43.969 --> 00:47.238
It needs to thoroughly disgust them.

00:47.239 --> 00:50.107
Wendell,

00:50.109 --> 00:52.009
when you next look at this liquid,

00:52.043 --> 00:53.977
you will realize that it's not whiskey

00:53.979 --> 00:57.148
you've been drinking your whole life,

00:57.149 --> 01:00.083
but your mother's feces.

01:00.119 --> 01:03.220
Sometimes this comes a
bit too easily to you.

01:04.456 --> 01:08.058
From now on, every bit of alcohol...

01:08.059 --> 01:11.962
whiskey, beer, wine...

01:11.963 --> 01:14.398
it's made of your mother's waste.

01:17.002 --> 01:19.937
If you drink it, it will
make you horribly sick.

01:21.572 --> 01:24.574
You will be nauseated even at the sight.

01:27.345 --> 01:30.280
I will now wake you on the count of three.

01:33.284 --> 01:35.753
One,

01:35.754 --> 01:37.554
two...

01:38.857 --> 01:40.824
three.

01:51.135 --> 01:53.503
I'm gonna start writing this up.

02:00.311 --> 02:02.445
D.W. Garrison Carr.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.715
That's two Rs in Garrison, two Rs in Carr.

02:05.716 --> 02:08.551
I'm under the care of Dr. Algernon Edwards.

02:08.553 --> 02:10.485
That's one R.

02:10.487 --> 02:12.621
I don't see it here.

02:12.622 --> 02:15.358
Mr. Carr. Opal.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.394
What are you doing here?

02:18.395 --> 02:20.029
I'm trying to check in,

02:20.030 --> 02:22.465
but it appears they don't have my name.

02:25.035 --> 02:27.336
There must be some confusion.

02:29.073 --> 02:33.909
Were you told that I had gotten
approval to perform your surgery here?

02:33.910 --> 02:36.644
I'm giving you the go-ahead.

02:38.915 --> 02:41.416
This...

02:41.483 --> 02:44.519
This is not the way I wanted this handled.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.554
I know.

02:46.555 --> 02:48.656
You wanted permission.

02:48.657 --> 02:51.026
Now you have it.

02:51.027 --> 02:53.061
From us.

03:10.545 --> 03:12.579
Are you still awake?

03:15.416 --> 03:17.684
Yes.

03:29.197 --> 03:32.999
What's so funny?

03:33.034 --> 03:35.702
Why are you... why are you wearing that?

03:38.306 --> 03:42.141
Well, I thought to come in
fully clothed would be wrong,

03:42.277 --> 03:47.413
and then to come in fully unclothed
would be too forward, so...

03:50.618 --> 03:52.953
How would that be too forward?

03:56.758 --> 03:58.758
I think that's the point.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.395
I'm hoping you'll be forward.

04:20.380 --> 04:22.548
- May I?
- Come on.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.557
Oh, God.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.599
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.269
Yeah, a bit.

04:43.270 --> 04:45.004
Why, do I seem nervous?

04:47.240 --> 04:49.208
No. Me, too.

04:49.209 --> 04:52.044
Good. Good.

04:52.045 --> 04:54.146
Do you know what you're doing?

04:55.915 --> 04:58.283
I don't know, really.

04:58.284 --> 05:00.185
A little bit.

05:00.186 --> 05:03.356
Do... do you know what you're doing?

05:03.357 --> 05:05.791
Not a bit.

05:05.792 --> 05:08.728
Ahem, though...

05:08.729 --> 05:11.396
my uncle was a furrier

05:11.431 --> 05:14.266
who owned a farm and he
bred minks and beavers,

05:14.267 --> 05:17.235
so I have something to go on.

05:22.107 --> 05:24.441
Like that?

05:28.247 --> 05:30.414
What?

05:30.416 --> 05:32.416
You really know how to set the mood.

05:44.062 --> 05:47.264
Just kiss me.

05:47.266 --> 05:49.466
I'm trying.

06:06.919 --> 06:09.287
Give it to me now.

06:19.331 --> 06:21.933
It took three fittings,

06:21.934 --> 06:24.768
but it's perfect.

06:24.769 --> 06:26.637
Perfect?

06:26.638 --> 06:28.839
It's exquisite.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.975
This is French Chantilly

06:30.976 --> 06:34.043
with silk floss taffeta.

06:34.145 --> 06:37.314
Do you know how much your
Henry must have spent on this?

06:37.315 --> 06:40.516
I know exactly how much.

06:40.517 --> 06:42.352
He didn't buy it.

06:42.353 --> 06:44.321
I did.

06:44.322 --> 06:46.556
He didn't buy it?

06:46.557 --> 06:48.491
No.

06:49.893 --> 06:52.228
But he expects it.

06:52.229 --> 06:54.464
And he's gonna get it.

06:58.336 --> 07:00.603
This is only half of what you owe me.

07:00.637 --> 07:03.473
Oh, I've had some unforeseen expenses.

07:03.474 --> 07:05.475
We're all feeling the pinch.

07:08.078 --> 07:09.878
Perhaps there'd be more
money if you weren't skimming

07:09.879 --> 07:13.548
so much of it to pay
for your new apartment.

07:13.649 --> 07:16.185
My firm works with real
estate men all over the city.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.453
I have friends. We talk.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.823
In fact, I was thinking of
visiting that building myself

07:21.824 --> 07:23.392
to see that dirty little whore

07:23.493 --> 07:25.793
and her Chinky-eyed escort
you've been bringing by.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.698
That has nothing to do with this building.

07:31.001 --> 07:32.032
Well, if that's true,

07:32.033 --> 07:34.169
it shouldn't be a problem
for you to tell your board

07:34.336 --> 07:37.839
I need the rest of my money and
my rate is going up by $1 an hour.

07:52.287 --> 07:54.923
Excuse me, Doctor.

08:05.934 --> 08:10.070
My hernia doesn't seem
to like this bed too much.

08:11.473 --> 08:15.076
Would it be possible to get
something for my discomfort?

08:15.077 --> 08:16.844
No.

09:05.593 --> 09:08.094
- What?
- Have you seen what's in the ward?

09:08.095 --> 09:10.196
I told you I would talk to the board.

09:10.197 --> 09:11.864
And I appreciate that.

09:11.865 --> 09:13.833
Bringing Carr wasn't my idea.

09:13.834 --> 09:15.667
It was his. I didn't know.

09:15.669 --> 09:17.603
And you couldn't ask him to leave?

09:17.638 --> 09:20.106
I could have, but I didn't because...

09:22.375 --> 09:26.279
because deep down I knew the
board would never allow it.

09:26.346 --> 09:30.416
I knew that asking would
just be a waste of time.

09:30.450 --> 09:33.119
And enough time has been wasted already.

09:33.153 --> 09:35.421
Well, congratulations on your victory.

09:35.522 --> 09:38.390
He's the first and likely
the last for a very long time.

09:38.492 --> 09:40.404
I have no doubt that the
board will make sure of it.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.528
They're happy to treat
worthless drug addicts

09:42.529 --> 09:43.862
who've tossed away their own lives,

09:43.863 --> 09:45.331
but God forbid they commit the sin

09:45.332 --> 09:46.965
of treating deserving colored folks.

09:46.966 --> 09:49.067
You have your cause and I have mine.

09:49.136 --> 09:51.236
If you could have been
a little more patient,

09:51.283 --> 09:53.558
I might have been able to
make this happen legitimately.

09:53.559 --> 09:55.607
Instead, you act like an impetuous child.

09:55.708 --> 09:59.277
You want this man to stay, this
is now a fight you fight alone.

09:59.312 --> 10:01.246
I didn't expect it to be any other way.

10:01.314 --> 10:04.416
- Is this a provocation?
- No, it's the future.

10:04.518 --> 10:07.019
You think it's here too early
and I think it's here too late.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.087
I don't know.

10:09.221 --> 10:12.290
I don't know. Did we make a
mistake going with the hydrangea?

10:12.391 --> 10:15.293
'Cause the color seems to
clash with the tablecloth.

10:16.395 --> 10:18.063
Oh!

10:18.097 --> 10:20.198
And the salad forks
aren't polished correctly.

10:20.199 --> 10:23.101
- Look.
- It looks fine.

10:23.102 --> 10:26.104
Fine is not what these guests expect.

10:26.105 --> 10:28.338
You of all people know that.

10:28.339 --> 10:29.940
Would you please hand me my purse?

10:29.941 --> 10:33.277
I have some nerve tonic inside.

10:33.344 --> 10:36.847
Oh, I don't understand how you're so calm.

10:37.049 --> 10:41.385
Because I know that this is going to
be the best charity ball of the season.

10:43.221 --> 10:44.888
I need to leave.

10:44.890 --> 10:46.756
I have a final fitting for my dress.

10:46.758 --> 10:49.258
- Now?
- I'll come back straight after.

11:17.554 --> 11:21.189
Can I help you, miss?
You just off that ship?

11:21.225 --> 11:24.260
No, I came in here to speak to someone.

11:24.261 --> 11:25.894
Are you expected?

11:25.895 --> 11:28.130
No.

11:28.131 --> 11:30.165
The Corinthian is due tomorrow.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.100
Expected anyways.

11:32.102 --> 11:33.835
It's one of my father's ships.

11:33.903 --> 11:37.505
The Robertson line. I'm Cornelia Robertson.

11:37.506 --> 11:39.174
Well, Showalter now.

11:39.175 --> 11:41.343
You here on some sort of business?

11:41.344 --> 11:44.212
I suppose.

11:44.347 --> 11:47.315
Then you're gonna want to be
speaking with Lead Inspector Bradley.

11:50.954 --> 11:53.288
I remember when he was just starting out.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.924
Your old dad was hustling a
few third hand buckets of bolts.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.993
Helming most of them himself.

11:58.994 --> 12:02.096
Look at him now.

12:02.164 --> 12:04.832
Every time I see a ship
marked Robertson Shipping,

12:04.833 --> 12:06.635
I tell my men to treat it right.

12:06.636 --> 12:08.069
Oh, I know he'd be grateful.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.905
The company means everything to us.

12:10.973 --> 12:14.142
Never known a woman to
work a company business.

12:14.143 --> 12:16.510
Especially one like you.

12:16.511 --> 12:20.047
My father has a lot of trust in me.

12:20.048 --> 12:22.683
Are you here on a separate matter

12:22.684 --> 12:24.952
or our usual deal?

12:24.953 --> 12:27.989
No, just the usual deal.

12:27.990 --> 12:30.691
No one else was available.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.360
Normally we take care of
this at the end of the month,

12:33.395 --> 12:36.197
but I can give you what I've got so far.

12:51.913 --> 12:54.147
They're coming in from
everywhere these days.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.182
Every month there's more.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.685
But you won't hear anyone
bellyaching around here,

12:58.686 --> 13:00.653
even if it is more work.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.688
Are these all the passengers?

13:02.723 --> 13:05.024
Just the ones that would
have been sent back.

13:05.026 --> 13:08.561
Oh, and one of my inspectors,

13:08.696 --> 13:12.231
he says he got sick from one
of the ones that we let through.

13:12.232 --> 13:13.700
Threatened to go to the higher-ups

13:13.701 --> 13:16.369
if we didn't give him a bigger cut.

13:16.370 --> 13:18.438
We took care of that.

13:18.439 --> 13:20.906
Oh.

13:20.907 --> 13:22.508
What kind of sick?

13:22.509 --> 13:24.210
Didn't say.

13:24.211 --> 13:26.345
- You didn't ask?
- No.

13:27.848 --> 13:31.316
Any idea which of the passengers
got the inspector sick?

13:31.352 --> 13:33.719
One of the steerage scum or third-classers

13:33.721 --> 13:35.854
that we bumped to second-class.

13:36.021 --> 13:38.961
We keep them out of sight and get
them off quick here at the docks.

13:40.693 --> 13:43.528
Of course. Well, anything's
better than having them

13:43.596 --> 13:46.364
pass through health
inspection at Ellis Island.

13:47.266 --> 13:49.067
Yeah, it's smart,

13:49.068 --> 13:51.269
paying me to send them through

13:51.270 --> 13:53.805
instead of paying to send them back.

13:53.806 --> 13:55.907
Big savings.

13:55.908 --> 13:58.209
You Robertsons are clever.

13:58.210 --> 14:01.546
We certainly are.

14:01.614 --> 14:05.048
We've been working with
spacers to create excess skin

14:05.049 --> 14:06.884
to cover the separation point.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.754
We need to be meticulous and go slowly,

14:10.756 --> 14:13.023
so stemming blood loss is crucial.

14:13.124 --> 14:16.594
The more experienced nurses will
be assisting one surgeon each.

14:16.595 --> 14:18.429
Nurse Pell, Dr. Edwards.

14:18.430 --> 14:19.963
Baker, Gallinger.

14:19.964 --> 14:21.544
Nurse Elkins, you'll be with me.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.067
Nurse Shane, as you have the
most experience with ether,

14:24.068 --> 14:25.436
you'll be assisting Dr. Chickering

14:25.437 --> 14:27.738
on keeping both girls anesthetized.

14:27.739 --> 14:30.306
Nurse Ryan and Nurse Kenilworth

14:30.474 --> 14:33.610
will be keeping a close count on how
much blood each girl has surrendered.

14:33.611 --> 14:37.479
Since we're sure that Zoya and Nika
each have their own circulatory system,

14:37.581 --> 14:40.316
we may be able to safely
transfuse from one to the other

14:40.350 --> 14:42.518
depending on their individual condition.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.921
But I say this only as a last resort.

14:44.922 --> 14:46.989
It would be historic.

14:47.124 --> 14:50.292
I'm not looking to make
history with their transfusion.

14:50.327 --> 14:53.096
I want to make history with their survival.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.965
Would you want a reporter
there to chronicle that history?

14:55.966 --> 14:57.533
Genevieve asked.

14:57.534 --> 14:59.435
She's welcome to attend.

14:59.436 --> 15:01.770
As the girls are white.

15:01.805 --> 15:04.973
But I was hoping to capture this surgery

15:04.974 --> 15:06.842
with something more than just words.

15:06.843 --> 15:08.543
Photographs?

15:08.678 --> 15:12.680
No, I was thinking of one of
those new motion picture cameras.

15:12.749 --> 15:15.050
Has a surgery ever been
captured that way before?

15:15.051 --> 15:16.584
There's always a first.

15:16.585 --> 15:18.386
I believe Henry Robertson has one.

15:18.420 --> 15:21.122
Well, let's ask him for it.

15:21.323 --> 15:25.060
Put the thing to some real use instead
of capturing silly street scenes

15:25.061 --> 15:27.695
or whatever else he uses it for.

15:34.836 --> 15:37.237
Hey there.

15:39.508 --> 15:41.676
Where are you off to all gussied up?

15:41.743 --> 15:44.512
Church. They can throw me out if they want,

15:44.547 --> 15:46.527
but they're gonna have to do it to my face.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.617
I'll go with you.

15:49.618 --> 15:51.352
I can fight my own battles.

15:51.420 --> 15:53.688
I don't need you causing
rows, picking fights.

15:53.789 --> 15:56.191
Yeah, I'm going with you 'cause
I want to punch out a nun.

15:56.192 --> 15:58.893
Figured a good left hook would
get right through that habit.

15:58.927 --> 16:01.195
I just thought it'd be nice, you know?

16:01.196 --> 16:02.929
The show ain't bad.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.465
Some of them homilies is all right.

16:05.466 --> 16:07.233
And I know most of them songs,

16:07.235 --> 16:10.136
so I figure why the hell not?

16:10.205 --> 16:12.672
Because you scorn God
at every chance you get.

16:12.707 --> 16:15.375
Ah, in fairness, He scorned me first.

16:15.410 --> 16:18.078
Now, do you want me to go or don't you?

16:18.079 --> 16:19.746
Okay, then.

16:19.780 --> 16:22.215
But wear something clean and no cussing.

16:22.383 --> 16:24.951
The only thing cleaner than my
mouth will be my fucking shirt.

16:24.952 --> 16:28.555
Now go back in your cave
unless you want an eyeful.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.435
Can't be here until sunup.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.337
I'll only be a minute.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.506
Relative?

17:21.507 --> 17:23.275
Patient.

17:23.342 --> 17:26.778
They put that fancy
headstone in a few weeks ago.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.114
Don't usually see one that big for a kid.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.850
Maybe it's for the woman
she never got to be.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.719
Then she would have been some woman.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.355
That cost 50 bucks at least.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.427
65.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.075
Good morning, girls.

17:58.076 --> 18:00.144
It's time for us to get you ready.

18:12.191 --> 18:13.558
Good morning, Doctor.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.593
Bertie, do me a favor.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.561
Hop up there, would you?

18:17.562 --> 18:19.496
Sure.

18:26.371 --> 18:29.072
- Sturdy.
- Good.

18:29.207 --> 18:32.541
Last thing we need are these
tables splitting like the Red Sea

18:32.543 --> 18:34.083
in the middle of the operation.

18:35.713 --> 18:37.413
Have you been drinking?

18:37.414 --> 18:39.549
No, no, no. It's turpentine.

18:39.550 --> 18:42.118
A little gut irritation.

18:42.219 --> 18:44.954
You want to be careful with
how much you take of that.

18:45.021 --> 18:46.789
You don't want to start
trading your gut problem

18:46.857 --> 18:48.691
for a bladder problem
caused by the medicine.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.993
Thank you, Doctor.

18:51.027 --> 18:54.464
Well, the girls can begin being prepped.

18:54.465 --> 18:56.466
They already are.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.734
I hope you got some rest

18:58.802 --> 19:01.203
'cause this is gonna be
a real test of stamina.

19:01.204 --> 19:03.606
Some. Did you?

19:03.607 --> 19:05.675
I'm guessing not.

19:05.709 --> 19:08.811
Are you concerned about the procedure?

19:08.879 --> 19:11.813
It can wait a few days.
We can always postpone.

19:11.882 --> 19:14.316
No, no, no, no. I feel excellent, really.

19:14.384 --> 19:17.052
I'll see you in the
scrub room in 20 minutes.

19:59.594 --> 20:01.595
Hello.

20:01.596 --> 20:04.498
It's me.

20:04.499 --> 20:06.200
Are you all right?

20:06.201 --> 20:08.436
No.

20:08.437 --> 20:10.305
They're alive now,

20:10.306 --> 20:12.773
both of them.

20:12.774 --> 20:15.843
Not perfect, but well enough.

20:15.945 --> 20:18.112
And they'll be better
off when you're through.

20:18.113 --> 20:20.281
Or not.

20:24.719 --> 20:29.789
Abby, this used to be easier.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.426
It was never supposed to be easy.

20:35.363 --> 20:37.297
That's why they needed you.

20:37.298 --> 20:39.466
What do you need?

20:40.568 --> 20:43.337
I need you

20:43.338 --> 20:45.538
to tell me...

20:47.475 --> 20:49.175
that I can do this.

20:51.579 --> 20:53.680
Of course you can.

20:55.850 --> 20:59.018
If I hadn't believed in
you, I wouldn't even be here.

21:23.076 --> 21:25.177
Gentlemen.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.213
Ladies.

21:30.384 --> 21:32.951
They are Russian.

21:32.952 --> 21:36.587
They are 16 years old.

21:36.688 --> 21:39.624
They have led until this
day a life of slavery,

21:39.625 --> 21:42.493
exploitation, and humiliation.

21:42.628 --> 21:46.564
They're what we in the medical
profession call Omphalopagus twins,

21:46.565 --> 21:48.098
joined by a band of cartilage

21:48.134 --> 21:51.969
and soft tissue in their midsection.

21:51.970 --> 21:53.838
Through extensive examination,

21:53.972 --> 21:57.508
I have concluded that the only
organ they share is the liver.

21:57.576 --> 22:00.777
It is our intention today
to separate the girls,

22:00.811 --> 22:02.979
leaving each of them enough of the liver

22:02.980 --> 22:05.282
so that it can regenerate over time

22:05.283 --> 22:07.317
and continue normal function.

22:07.385 --> 22:10.120
This is their last day
as a sideshow attraction

22:10.121 --> 22:12.255
and you their last audience.

22:15.660 --> 22:18.395
This is no magic trick.

22:18.396 --> 22:20.130
No illusion.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.298
No sleight of hand.

22:23.668 --> 22:26.970
It is scientific knowledge

22:26.971 --> 22:28.739
and rigorous experimentation

22:28.806 --> 22:31.274
that will finally allow
these two young ladies

22:31.408 --> 22:36.212
to live the humane life of which
fate has so far robbed them.

22:37.514 --> 22:39.282
They're ready.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.229
Nurse Elkins, surgical knife.

23:14.884 --> 23:17.085
In opening up the girls,

23:17.186 --> 23:20.288
we discovered a delicate
prolongation of liver substance

23:20.289 --> 23:22.157
in the connecting band.

23:26.028 --> 23:28.395
At this point, the liver is fully exposed

23:28.396 --> 23:30.164
and Dr. Gallinger is placing a clamp

23:30.332 --> 23:34.168
on the hepatoduodenal ligament,
which greatly decreases the bleeding.

23:36.972 --> 23:41.309
Once the liver was bisected, each team
began the delicate task of suturing.

23:44.713 --> 23:46.713
It's difficult to see in this motion film,

23:46.715 --> 23:48.515
but I devised a new type of suture

23:48.583 --> 23:51.653
based on my research and
work with sailing knots.

23:51.654 --> 23:53.454
This new suture,

23:53.488 --> 23:55.722
which I named the Gallinger Knot,

23:55.758 --> 23:58.826
did an excellent job of joining tissue.

23:58.927 --> 24:02.963
Now, Nika, the girl whom Dr.
Edwards and I were working on,

24:02.997 --> 24:04.831
developed a problem in her peritoneum

24:04.832 --> 24:06.667
which we had to address.

24:08.102 --> 24:10.604
Her abdominal cavity was thoroughly washed

24:10.605 --> 24:12.773
of any escaping fluids to avoid shock.

24:12.940 --> 24:16.577
And to help in this, we had to make
an opening in the pouch of Douglas.

24:21.683 --> 24:25.118
The entire operation took
three and a half hours.

24:25.119 --> 24:28.321
The girls are resting comfortably.

24:28.423 --> 24:31.892
So far Nika has a slight case
of postoperative pneumonia

24:31.893 --> 24:34.127
which we are monitoring.

24:34.128 --> 24:37.630
This surgery, gentlemen, proves once again

24:37.732 --> 24:42.268
how high we can soar on the
wings of science and ingenuity.

24:50.144 --> 24:51.911
What is this material?

24:51.913 --> 24:55.181
Celluloid. Amazing substance.

24:55.249 --> 24:58.218
Thicker pieces can actually
be molded into objects.

24:58.252 --> 25:00.253
I know one fellow who
makes jewelry out of it

25:00.254 --> 25:03.089
and fools people into
thinking it's real ivory.

25:16.636 --> 25:17.803
Hello, Neely.

25:17.804 --> 25:20.339
I have something for you.

25:20.340 --> 25:21.941
For the ball tonight.

25:21.942 --> 25:23.342
Well, can it wait, please?

25:23.343 --> 25:25.377
No.

25:26.747 --> 25:29.081
- How did you...
- Put them on.

25:38.090 --> 25:41.960
I had my man contact the jeweler to
whom you sold them in San Francisco

25:41.961 --> 25:44.328
and I purchased them back.

25:44.330 --> 25:47.298
I wanted you to have them then,

25:47.300 --> 25:49.868
and I want you to have them now.

25:49.869 --> 25:53.271
They're too beautiful for anyone else.

25:53.272 --> 25:55.272
Thank you.

25:56.375 --> 25:58.976
I also had this made

25:58.977 --> 26:01.845
as a complement.

26:12.491 --> 26:14.792
Mmm, marvelous.

26:16.995 --> 26:19.630
I always told you I would
treat you like a daughter.

26:21.232 --> 26:23.300
And haven't I?

26:25.670 --> 26:28.671
You've been very kind.

26:28.673 --> 26:31.874
Both you and Mrs. Showalter.

26:31.875 --> 26:34.343
Then what more do you want?

26:35.813 --> 26:38.180
I don't want anything.

26:38.182 --> 26:40.282
Because I've given you everything

26:40.318 --> 26:43.886
and still it's not enough for you.

26:43.887 --> 26:47.089
We had a bargain.

26:47.090 --> 26:49.659
I would bring you back to New York

26:49.694 --> 26:52.561
and you would stop your running around.

26:52.596 --> 26:55.364
You swore you would
give your full attention

26:55.399 --> 26:58.034
to the needs of my son and this family,

26:58.035 --> 27:00.069
your family.

27:00.103 --> 27:03.006
- And I have.
- You've done no such thing.

27:04.342 --> 27:06.275
You've barely attended any of the meetings

27:06.276 --> 27:08.177
of the ball committee.

27:08.346 --> 27:12.848
Instead you've been sneaking
around like a thief in the night,

27:12.950 --> 27:17.619
scurrying like a rat
investigating your dead inspector.

27:17.620 --> 27:19.388
You've had someone following me.

27:19.389 --> 27:21.557
And for good reason.

27:21.558 --> 27:23.259
You don't understand what I...

27:23.260 --> 27:26.728
You should be pregnant!

27:28.098 --> 27:31.333
Did he threaten you?

27:31.368 --> 27:33.536
- No.
- Then what happened?

27:33.636 --> 27:37.373
I just want to leave this
house and never come back.

27:37.407 --> 27:39.941
My father isn't a man you want to upset.

27:41.311 --> 27:42.745
I don't care.

27:42.746 --> 27:44.846
And neither would I.

27:44.882 --> 27:46.749
But you know I think
the world of your father

27:46.750 --> 27:49.785
and we need to make sure
that he is protected.

27:49.786 --> 27:51.720
From what?

27:52.822 --> 27:54.623
From you.

27:54.624 --> 27:57.592
Excuse me?

27:57.660 --> 28:00.729
He owes my father an
enormous amount of money.

28:00.830 --> 28:03.565
His investment is all that's
keeping Robertson Shipping afloat.

28:03.566 --> 28:06.367
He could call your father's note.

28:06.403 --> 28:08.503
Even the rumor of a
rift between our families

28:08.505 --> 28:10.438
would send the stock plummeting.

28:10.507 --> 28:12.908
Wolves would eat him for
breakfast on the exchange.

28:14.844 --> 28:18.113
I... I never even thought...

28:18.147 --> 28:20.381
That's where I have to
think for both of us.

28:22.084 --> 28:25.052
If we run from my father
and his fortune now,

28:25.154 --> 28:27.355
there'll be no fortune of
your father's for us to run to,

28:27.356 --> 28:29.390
not for very long.

28:30.658 --> 28:32.592
There are a dozen ways
the Showalters could ruin

28:32.593 --> 28:34.661
the Robertsons and never
give it a second thought.

28:39.867 --> 28:42.969
So what do we do?

28:50.045 --> 28:52.178
What did my father ask of you?

28:53.982 --> 28:56.916
To make you happy.

28:59.820 --> 29:02.688
Then make me happy.

29:02.789 --> 29:05.824
How does it go up there? Can you lose it?

29:05.826 --> 29:07.993
No, you place it right in there.

29:08.028 --> 29:10.429
Give it a little soak in olive oil first.

29:10.464 --> 29:12.531
What if the fella has some sick on him?

29:12.566 --> 29:14.867
A disease? A rubber's your best chance.

29:14.901 --> 29:16.902
A Goodyear, but they're hard to come by.

29:20.407 --> 29:22.475
People been making good Johnny sheaths

29:22.509 --> 29:24.477
out of animal intestines for years.

29:24.544 --> 29:26.845
Just got to find somebody
who can make it right.

29:28.882 --> 29:31.016
Oh, pardon me.

29:31.085 --> 29:33.653
- I didn't know you was having tea.
- We're not.

29:33.753 --> 29:36.454
I'm teaching them how to
protect themselves from men.

29:36.522 --> 29:40.057
Well, three swift boot
heels to the scrotum,

29:40.193 --> 29:42.673
he'd rather be humping a beehive
and never come near you again.

29:46.532 --> 29:49.067
What do you use to not
get pregnant with him?

29:51.070 --> 29:52.904
Nothing.

29:52.938 --> 29:55.273
We're just sharing the
place for now. That's it.

29:55.274 --> 29:57.242
Sure.

29:57.243 --> 29:59.444
What's the occasion?

29:59.445 --> 30:03.181
Oh, there's a big to-do charity ball

30:03.182 --> 30:04.849
for the hospital tonight.

30:05.018 --> 30:07.318
Figured there ain't a chance in
hell of me and Harry getting invited,

30:07.386 --> 30:10.587
so why not have a little
hooley of our own right here?

30:10.588 --> 30:12.123
If that's all right with you, Harry.

30:12.124 --> 30:13.624
I suppose.

30:13.691 --> 30:16.427
Right, I'll get started
on these chops, then.

30:20.899 --> 30:23.300
Well, so far I've seen three Phippses,

30:23.301 --> 30:25.936
two Gould heirs, Van Rensselaers,

30:25.937 --> 30:27.504
Lina Astor.

30:27.605 --> 30:30.141
We might be the only two
working men in this whole room.

30:30.142 --> 30:32.275
Imagine how I feel.

30:32.410 --> 30:35.912
I don't get to wear ball gowns
very often in my line of work.

30:36.047 --> 30:38.882
Opal, you look like you were
born to wear dresses like that.

30:38.883 --> 30:40.217
I was.

30:40.251 --> 30:42.085
But I'm really here for the entertainment.

30:42.086 --> 30:44.220
They have Williams and
Walker performing tonight.

30:44.221 --> 30:47.123
I took Opal to see them and we haven't
stopped talking about them since.

30:47.124 --> 30:49.960
We already have tickets for
their new show on Broadway.

30:49.961 --> 30:51.761
Oh.

30:51.762 --> 30:53.829
Hmm.

30:53.830 --> 30:55.397
Mm-hmm.

31:14.684 --> 31:16.718
I'm fighting Wingo tooth and nail,

31:16.752 --> 31:19.120
but he simply will not yield to reason.

31:19.189 --> 31:22.457
Changes at every turn,
slowing the workers to a crawl.

31:22.492 --> 31:25.093
It's been frightfully
expensive for all of us.

31:25.128 --> 31:26.561
- Fire him.
- Agreed.

31:26.596 --> 31:28.663
Of course I expected this might happen,

31:28.698 --> 31:30.765
so I've been holding back much of his fee.

31:30.766 --> 31:32.201
Oh, well done, Mr. Barrow.

31:32.202 --> 31:33.368
Shall I give him the boot now?

31:33.369 --> 31:34.835
You can do it in the morning.

31:34.836 --> 31:36.704
Let Michelangelo have his last dance.

31:36.705 --> 31:38.973
- Gentlemen.
- Gentlemen.

31:38.974 --> 31:40.741
Victoria.

31:40.842 --> 31:44.011
Hobie, Eunice, I hope you're
enjoying our festivities.

31:44.012 --> 31:46.213
It's a lovely evening.

31:46.215 --> 31:49.217
Cornelia, you have outdone yourself.

31:49.218 --> 31:50.951
Yes, you have, my dear.

31:51.987 --> 31:54.288
Your talents are endless.

31:54.323 --> 31:56.490
All of those many meetings you attended

31:56.491 --> 31:58.692
certainly have paid off.

31:58.693 --> 32:00.527
Thank you.

32:00.561 --> 32:02.662
Didn't I tell you that
being a leading woman

32:02.697 --> 32:05.398
of New York society would be rewarding?

32:05.399 --> 32:08.802
And you were right as usual, Eunice.

32:08.803 --> 32:10.503
Cornelia.

32:10.538 --> 32:13.307
Oh, thank you for your advice, Eunice.

32:13.407 --> 32:16.976
I hope, Father, that with
so many immigrants coming in,

32:17.077 --> 32:19.879
the new Knick will still have
room for the poor in its beds.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.948
We'll still have wards,

32:22.082 --> 32:26.618
but now they'll be offset by a
majority of patients of real means.

32:26.687 --> 32:29.321
Your father is a businessman, Cornelia,

32:29.322 --> 32:32.591
but one with a vulnerable heart.

32:32.660 --> 32:34.661
Let's hope not too vulnerable.

32:36.563 --> 32:40.098
Yours might not be the only vulnerable
heart in the family, Captain.

32:42.101 --> 32:44.870
Your plate's got more
bones than a graveyard.

32:44.871 --> 32:46.637
Don't say it like that.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.453
I won't have a stomach for the afters.

32:48.507 --> 32:50.575
There's afters? Where you gonna put it all?

32:50.576 --> 32:52.744
I'll make room.

32:55.848 --> 32:58.816
There, now I have a little
pouch for some cobbler.

32:59.852 --> 33:02.587
Hey, I was thinking

33:02.588 --> 33:06.257
about those ladies you was with today

33:06.392 --> 33:10.962
and their needing your knowledge
on contraception and all.

33:10.963 --> 33:13.564
There's not a lot out there for women

33:13.632 --> 33:16.000
to protect themselves
against a horny gent, huh?

33:16.101 --> 33:18.969
Fellas are always looking
to empty the bag in a girl.

33:18.970 --> 33:21.471
Never thinking about what comes after.

33:21.472 --> 33:23.240
Babies and diseases for a start.

33:23.241 --> 33:24.474
And there it is.

33:24.475 --> 33:26.577
Why don't we give it to them?

33:26.578 --> 33:29.814
Hmm? Do 'em a service.

33:29.815 --> 33:32.016
Another business proposition?

33:32.050 --> 33:35.085
Yeah. That last one was working fine.

33:35.087 --> 33:37.921
Until I nearly got 20 years in prison.

33:37.923 --> 33:40.624
Yeah, rubbers and stuff is illegal,

33:40.625 --> 33:42.159
but it's not like doing the fix.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.828
It's more like frowned upon.

33:43.829 --> 33:45.595
I've been frowned upon enough.

33:45.597 --> 33:47.297
And the penalty's just as tough.

33:47.332 --> 33:50.334
The ladies need it. The fellas do, too.

33:50.401 --> 33:53.303
If he's gonna put it inside there anyways,

33:53.438 --> 33:56.673
we'd be doing a lot of good helping
a bloke bag it up on the way in.

33:56.741 --> 33:58.875
And besides, we ain't
going back to the fix,

33:58.976 --> 34:02.879
so why not stop the trouble
before it gets that far?

34:04.982 --> 34:07.717
- It wouldn't be that difficult.
- Mm-hmm.

34:07.752 --> 34:10.687
You'd need lamb's guts for the condoms.

34:10.788 --> 34:13.089
- Mm-hmm.
- Vinegar and sponges for the ladies.

34:13.090 --> 34:14.924
Yeah, could charge a fortune.

34:14.925 --> 34:17.293
This city is full of customers.

34:17.295 --> 34:19.728
- Lord knows that's true.
- Mmm.

34:19.797 --> 34:22.130
And the split, 50-50 this time or nothing.

34:25.870 --> 34:27.971
Fair play.

34:27.972 --> 34:29.606
Okay.

34:43.320 --> 34:46.822
I can't tell you what seeing
you in that dress does to me.

34:48.625 --> 34:51.060
You can tell me.

34:51.195 --> 34:54.215
But you're gonna have to wait to
see if you can do anything about it.

34:56.366 --> 34:59.402
If I could, I'd leave here now
and take you straight back...

34:59.403 --> 35:02.571
But you can't.

35:02.572 --> 35:05.039
I'm here to dance and be doted upon.

35:06.375 --> 35:08.843
So I certainly hope you can keep me happy.

35:09.979 --> 35:11.813
Without a doubt.

35:13.516 --> 35:15.183
You can start with a drink.

35:16.820 --> 35:19.154
What would mademoiselle desire?

35:20.523 --> 35:22.324
You're the expert.

35:41.410 --> 35:44.478
Uh, two Whiskey Flips, please.

35:46.615 --> 35:49.017
- Ah.
- She's a real beauty.

35:51.053 --> 35:52.787
If you only knew.

35:52.788 --> 35:54.556
Jesus.

35:54.557 --> 35:56.691
Oh, how was Ohio?

35:56.692 --> 35:58.226
Did you solve your oil problem?

35:58.227 --> 35:59.860
I might have.

35:59.895 --> 36:03.597
See, we've always refined
crude into kerosene

36:03.631 --> 36:05.599
and thrown away the
waste that we strip down.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.769
It was flammable, so we piped it
into rivers and lakes just to be safe.

36:08.770 --> 36:10.471
Well, that's only responsible.

36:10.472 --> 36:13.106
But we needed a new idea

36:13.242 --> 36:16.943
and I just thought we could
find a use for that waste, too,

36:16.979 --> 36:20.080
so I hired some chemists and engineers.

36:20.249 --> 36:23.251
They've converted all the machines
at the refinery to run on the stuff.

36:23.252 --> 36:24.785
Not steam?

36:24.786 --> 36:27.121
Or electricity. It's miraculous.

36:27.122 --> 36:28.922
We call it gasoline.

36:28.957 --> 36:32.926
You look absolutely stunning. That dress.

36:32.928 --> 36:35.461
Henry's complimented me 100 times.

36:35.462 --> 36:36.996
It's worth every penny.

36:37.098 --> 36:39.732
Well, my brother can never
say no to a pretty girl

36:39.733 --> 36:42.269
and you're the prettiest in the room.

36:42.270 --> 36:44.837
Thank you, Cornelia.

36:44.906 --> 36:47.240
Lucy, I want you to
have a good time tonight.

36:49.110 --> 36:51.077
I plan to.

36:51.145 --> 36:54.747
I know you're new to all
this and you shouldn't be.

36:54.848 --> 36:59.652
You belong here and maybe you
even belong with my brother.

36:59.753 --> 37:03.355
But I don't want you to be
crushed when this is all over.

37:03.356 --> 37:06.425
And you think there will be an end?

37:06.426 --> 37:09.794
You know how fond I am of you.

37:09.796 --> 37:12.364
I'm saying this for your own sake.

37:12.365 --> 37:14.032
You're an innocent girl

37:14.100 --> 37:17.369
and I don't want you to be taken in by him,

37:17.503 --> 37:20.505
for you to surrender anything
because you believe there's a future.

37:20.506 --> 37:22.541
Why wouldn't there be?

37:22.542 --> 37:25.009
For an endless number of reasons.

37:25.045 --> 37:28.347
And I can see you're getting your hopes up.

37:28.481 --> 37:32.117
I think it's Henry whose
hopes are quite high right now.

37:32.152 --> 37:35.854
My father has expectations for his children

37:35.888 --> 37:39.458
of whom I was to marry and likewise Henry.

37:39.459 --> 37:41.560
I'm sure he does.

37:41.561 --> 37:43.294
Excuse me.

37:48.501 --> 37:50.301
I better like it.

37:50.369 --> 37:53.537
If you don't, I'll get
you something different.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.647
Look.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.720
Oh, thank you.

38:14.259 --> 38:16.727
They're all looking at me.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.630
Why wouldn't they? You're beautiful.

38:22.401 --> 38:24.067
I'm an oddity.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.606
But I don't care.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.574
I love being on your arm again.

38:30.575 --> 38:32.409
Well, get used to it

38:32.443 --> 38:35.478
because there's no place
I won't be taking you.

38:40.418 --> 38:43.186
Good evening. Lovely to see you.

38:43.187 --> 38:45.122
- You as well.
- My wife Opal.

38:45.189 --> 38:47.329
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.197
Whoop!

38:53.231 --> 38:55.565
- Cheers.
- To a lovely evening.

39:11.949 --> 39:14.484
Good evening, everyone.

39:14.485 --> 39:16.719
On behalf of the Knickerbocker Hospital

39:16.720 --> 39:18.120
and the ladies' ball committee,

39:18.121 --> 39:20.156
we want to thank you all for being here

39:20.157 --> 39:22.892
and for giving so generously.

39:26.664 --> 39:29.298
I asked my husband Herman

39:29.399 --> 39:32.435
what would make tonight
special for all of our guests

39:32.436 --> 39:34.436
and he said rye whiskey.

39:34.438 --> 39:35.669
I said that.

39:35.669 --> 39:38.007
Instead, we thought we would
start with some entertainment.

39:38.008 --> 39:40.009
And they're famous all over the nation

39:40.143 --> 39:43.879
and some of you have seen them
at Koster and Bial's Music Hall

39:43.913 --> 39:46.082
and they're soon to appear on Broadway

39:46.083 --> 39:48.284
in "In Dahomey."

39:49.652 --> 39:51.420
The original Cakewalkers,

39:51.455 --> 39:54.990
the Two Real Coons, Williams and Walker.

40:19.782 --> 40:22.283
That's right, we Two Real Coons.

40:22.284 --> 40:23.885
Ain't be no ivory under here.

40:23.886 --> 40:26.120
This is all dripping chocolate.

40:27.823 --> 40:29.790
- Don't you got childrens?
- Sure, I got 'em.

40:29.791 --> 40:31.725
Named all my children after flowers.

40:31.727 --> 40:35.529
There's Lily, Rose, and my son Artificial.

40:37.666 --> 40:39.766
- Don't you gots a job?
- Gots a bad one.

40:39.901 --> 40:43.070
But they say the ugliest kinds of
trades has their moments of pleasure.

40:43.071 --> 40:44.672
And I believes it.

40:44.673 --> 40:46.641
'Cause if I was a hangman

40:46.642 --> 40:48.809
or a gravedigger,

40:48.844 --> 40:51.011
I could get some sure enough enjoyment

40:51.013 --> 40:52.980
working for certain folks I know.

40:52.981 --> 40:55.381
Oh...

43:16.153 --> 43:17.853
Thank you.

43:20.690 --> 43:22.557
Beautiful night.

43:22.558 --> 43:24.325
Lovely.

43:24.327 --> 43:25.827
Are you warm enough, my dear?

43:25.895 --> 43:29.530
Oh, I believe that last sherry
is keeping me quite toasty.

43:34.136 --> 43:36.738
Algie.

43:36.739 --> 43:38.840
What an evening indeed.

43:38.841 --> 43:40.575
It was spectacular.

43:40.576 --> 43:43.377
I am so glad to have you here with us

43:43.413 --> 43:46.214
sharing the Knick and these times together.

43:46.316 --> 43:49.417
You know you've always
been family to me, Captain.

43:49.418 --> 43:52.252
And I am expecting some little ones

43:52.253 --> 43:54.888
from you two very soon.

43:54.989 --> 43:57.925
Now, you've never disappointed
me in any other area.

43:57.926 --> 44:00.227
Don't let me down now.

44:00.362 --> 44:03.931
So, Captain, where does Algie
stand in regard to the new hospital?

44:03.998 --> 44:06.100
I just told you how I feel about the boy.

44:06.167 --> 44:08.201
I've championed him every step of the way.

44:08.236 --> 44:09.837
But will he have a prominent position?

44:09.838 --> 44:11.939
Opal, not the time.

44:11.940 --> 44:13.807
You deserve an answer, Algernon.

44:13.842 --> 44:15.542
Oh, I think our carriage is here.

44:15.544 --> 44:17.511
I'm sure he'll wait for you.

44:18.579 --> 44:20.579
Captain?

44:25.219 --> 44:27.053
My God.

44:27.054 --> 44:29.255
I am fighting for you, Algie.

44:29.256 --> 44:30.757
Believe me.

44:30.758 --> 44:32.191
Henry and I both are.

44:32.192 --> 44:33.826
So...

44:35.195 --> 44:37.397
So I may have no position at all

44:37.398 --> 44:40.066
at the new hospital?

44:40.067 --> 44:42.401
What about Negro patients?

44:46.874 --> 44:49.175
Our people can entertain you

44:49.209 --> 44:51.043
and you shower them with platitudes,

44:51.144 --> 44:53.979
but in the end you are no
different from the rest of them.

44:54.081 --> 44:57.249
Mrs. Edwards, I believe
we've heard enough out of you.

44:57.284 --> 45:00.119
My husband is as generous as they come.

45:00.120 --> 45:01.620
Towards some people.

45:01.621 --> 45:03.522
I...

45:06.093 --> 45:09.561
am not funding the hospital by myself.

45:09.562 --> 45:11.630
And if you must know,

45:11.731 --> 45:15.767
I don't have the money to
fund my own part anymore.

45:15.768 --> 45:19.404
I am reliant on other donors

45:19.405 --> 45:22.073
and that's what they want.

45:22.141 --> 45:25.076
I could have done 100 other
things with that money,

45:25.077 --> 45:27.145
but I wanted to help people.

45:27.146 --> 45:29.414
As far as I can tell,

45:29.415 --> 45:32.850
you're not helping anyone at all.

45:32.985 --> 45:36.187
So perhaps you'll understand
if I don't want to remain here

45:36.188 --> 45:38.756
to endure your disdain any longer.

45:41.593 --> 45:44.095
I am very sorry...

45:45.664 --> 45:47.997
that I've disappointed you, son.

45:49.167 --> 45:53.137
I will do everything I can

45:53.138 --> 45:55.472
to assure your position.

45:58.443 --> 46:00.444
Victoria.

46:01.612 --> 46:03.847
You ruined my night.

46:12.657 --> 46:14.858
I'm going to do what I can, Jesse.

46:14.859 --> 46:16.992
I expect you will.

46:24.201 --> 46:26.336
The only lion I is a-taming

46:26.337 --> 46:28.036
is the dandelion.

46:28.072 --> 46:30.406
You have another profession

46:30.407 --> 46:32.027
if you ever get tired of medicine.

46:32.042 --> 46:34.077
We should get tickets for
the play. Would you like that?

46:34.078 --> 46:36.612
I would. Very much.

46:39.483 --> 46:41.985
Here we are.

46:41.986 --> 46:43.852
Together again.

46:44.921 --> 46:46.655
Are you surprised?

46:46.656 --> 46:48.556
Not a bit.

46:48.591 --> 46:50.958
Well, that's because nothing surprises you.

46:50.994 --> 46:53.561
Because I've never loved anyone but you.

46:56.532 --> 46:59.100
There is something about Abigail Healey

46:59.102 --> 47:01.202
that has completely enchanted me

47:01.237 --> 47:03.471
from the very first moment I saw you.

47:03.506 --> 47:05.607
Well, I certainly hope it wasn't my nose.

47:08.544 --> 47:12.247
Is there anything more you could do to it?

47:12.248 --> 47:14.282
Like what?

47:14.283 --> 47:16.417
Well, straighten it.

47:16.418 --> 47:19.220
Or fix the ragged edge right here.

47:19.221 --> 47:22.056
Still bothers you that much?

47:22.090 --> 47:24.391
I'd like to think I was bigger than that,

47:24.527 --> 47:29.030
but being at the ball and seeing
all those beautiful women...

47:30.533 --> 47:33.434
Even with all your
compliments, I still just...

47:33.435 --> 47:36.370
don't feel right.

47:36.371 --> 47:37.972
I know I shouldn't complain.

47:38.140 --> 47:41.242
- It's so much better than it was.
- No, no, no, I understand.

47:41.309 --> 47:44.913
I'll look into it. I'm
sure I can do something.

47:44.914 --> 47:48.048
But I have to say,

47:48.050 --> 47:50.183
I like this one just fine.

48:02.264 --> 48:03.964
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

48:03.965 --> 48:06.733
What's wrong?

48:06.734 --> 48:09.236
Am I hurting you?

48:09.237 --> 48:11.638
You want me to be more gentle?

48:34.161 --> 48:36.496
Now we can really fuck.

48:36.530 --> 48:39.231
Lie back and I'll show you what I like.

48:52.012 --> 48:53.846
Isn't that better?

49:07.861 --> 49:10.730
Thank you, Mr. Fester.

49:10.731 --> 49:13.032
Mr. Wingo,

49:13.133 --> 49:15.667
this will serve as your
letter of termination,

49:15.669 --> 49:17.870
but it will also serve as insurance.

49:17.871 --> 49:20.006
For what?

49:20.007 --> 49:22.607
I know how your type thinks.

49:22.709 --> 49:26.145
You want to look for
opportunity for petty revenge.

49:26.212 --> 49:28.779
An anonymous letter, a
word to the hospital board

49:28.881 --> 49:31.849
about the way I've conducted
my business dealings.

49:31.851 --> 49:35.086
I think you now have a good idea

49:35.187 --> 49:38.889
of the price you'll pay for
any and all indiscretions.

49:39.925 --> 49:41.859
Today you're only swallowing a few teeth,

49:41.861 --> 49:43.594
tomorrow it could be much worse.

49:43.595 --> 49:46.865
Fuck you.

49:48.534 --> 49:50.869
You want to try that again?

49:50.870 --> 49:53.037
I understand.

49:53.039 --> 49:55.273
Very good.

49:55.407 --> 49:58.208
What makes this procedure different

49:58.209 --> 49:59.609
from all others?

50:09.587 --> 50:13.190
This is the last place I
expected to see you today.

50:13.224 --> 50:16.326
Seems I missed one
minstrel show at the ball.

50:16.394 --> 50:19.563
Couldn't pass up the
opportunity to see another.

50:21.632 --> 50:24.600
Now that I've made the
transverse elliptical incision

50:24.601 --> 50:26.635
around the hernia and the umbilicus,

50:26.636 --> 50:28.537
I will now deepen it

50:28.572 --> 50:30.406
to the base of the hernia intrusion.

50:57.100 --> 50:59.700
Nurse Ryan, suction wand.

51:14.250 --> 51:17.818
I now need to clear the muscles
attached to the aponeurotic membrane

51:17.919 --> 51:21.422
by a half an inch in all
directions from the hernial sac.

51:21.457 --> 51:23.357
These muscles tend to be quite rigid,

51:23.359 --> 51:26.526
so to alleviate that, I'll inject them

51:26.527 --> 51:29.764
with a solution of 2% curare

51:29.765 --> 51:31.665
as a relaxant.

51:31.666 --> 51:33.267
Syringe.

52:10.537 --> 52:13.171
I will now divide the fibrous
and peritoneal membranes

52:13.173 --> 52:14.840
using a circular manner at the neck.

52:14.841 --> 52:16.642
This will expose his contents

52:16.743 --> 52:20.145
and allow me to see if there's
any intestinal viscera present.

52:20.213 --> 52:22.848
Dr. Edwards, his breathing
is rapid and shallow.

52:24.751 --> 52:26.918
Check his airway. Is it anaphylaxis?

52:26.919 --> 52:28.820
No, it's clear.

52:28.854 --> 52:31.723
No redness or swelling
anywhere that I can see.

52:35.561 --> 52:37.061
No palpitations.

52:37.062 --> 52:38.930
It's not a reaction to an allergen.

52:38.931 --> 52:40.865
He stopped breathing.

52:43.769 --> 52:45.402
Let me think this through.

52:45.504 --> 52:47.270
It's his heart. Has he had
a problem with it before?

52:47.271 --> 52:49.940
- No, nothing.
- There's a weak pulse.

52:49.941 --> 52:52.042
No breathing.

52:56.080 --> 52:58.081
Don't do a thing.

53:00.017 --> 53:02.686
Look at his muscles. They've gone limp.

53:02.754 --> 53:05.188
He's urinated himself,
unable to hold his bladder.

53:05.189 --> 53:06.690
He's paralyzed.

53:06.691 --> 53:07.857
The curare?

53:07.858 --> 53:09.625
It's a paralytic.

53:09.626 --> 53:11.894
No, I only gave him a small dose.

53:11.895 --> 53:14.597
The same amount I always give.

53:14.598 --> 53:16.398
Well, most obviously not.

53:16.433 --> 53:18.067
You must have mistakenly
given the wrong dose,

53:18.201 --> 53:20.903
rendering nearly every muscle
in his body completely useless.

53:20.904 --> 53:25.074
More specifically, his diaphragm.

53:26.109 --> 53:28.177
No, it couldn't be.

53:28.278 --> 53:30.345
It's the only thing that
would account for the symptoms.

53:30.380 --> 53:32.914
If his heart can keep up this weak beat,

53:32.948 --> 53:34.983
he should be fine once
the curare wears off.

53:35.050 --> 53:37.451
Just have to breathe for him until then.

53:37.487 --> 53:41.089
The good knight Gallinger
rides to the rescue.

53:44.226 --> 53:46.795
You should continue on
with your hernia work.

53:46.796 --> 53:48.697
I'll keep him alive while you do.

54:03.145 --> 54:05.413
How the hell could it go so wrong...

54:07.016 --> 54:08.982
so fast?

54:12.922 --> 54:14.955
Gallinger of all people.

54:17.293 --> 54:19.727
The white knight to the rescue.

54:19.761 --> 54:22.730
The reporters loved it.

54:25.367 --> 54:27.302
Ah!

54:27.303 --> 54:29.304
It's a disaster.

54:32.041 --> 54:33.974
We set out trying to prove one point

54:34.009 --> 54:37.177
and we wound up proving the opposite.

54:45.786 --> 54:47.354
It's all right, my darling.

54:50.325 --> 54:52.592
We're going to have better days.

55:01.970 --> 55:04.003
A lot of better days.

55:04.276 --> 55:10.776
