14:24.657 --> 14:26.217
Dad, she needed help.

14:26.242 --> 14:27.218
She was sick.
Khumba.

14:27.243 --> 14:29.345
Like Mama.

14:29.370 --> 14:30.871
Enough.

14:33.582 --> 14:38.437
(GASPING)

14:38.462 --> 14:41.357
Khumba, oh.

14:41.382 --> 14:44.301
For you, Mama.

14:46.303 --> 14:49.406
You're growing.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.951
You need your strength.
You have it.

14:51.976 --> 14:55.287
(LAUGHS) You're just
like your father.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.206
I'm nothing like Dad.

14:57.231 --> 14:59.208
I'm not like any of you.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.669
(COUGHING)

15:01.694 --> 15:05.297
Do you know why
I named you Khumba?

15:05.322 --> 15:08.759
You see, Khumba means skin.

15:08.784 --> 15:10.678
Skin?

15:10.703 --> 15:14.431
They say that the first
zebras to walk the Earth

15:14.456 --> 15:18.185
all had exactly the same skin

15:18.210 --> 15:21.313
with no stripes at all.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.566
<i>No stripes?
Mm-hmm.</i>

15:23.591 --> 15:26.402
<i>One day, a brave young zebra</i>

15:26.427 --> 15:29.972
<i>took a journey
across the vast Karoo.</i>

15:32.016 --> 15:34.827
<i>And deep inside a huge mountain,</i>

15:34.852 --> 15:37.538
<i>he found a water hole,</i>

15:37.563 --> 15:41.000
<i>a magic water hole.</i>

15:41.025 --> 15:44.003
<i>He swam in it,
and when he came out,</i>

15:44.028 --> 15:47.339
<i>his skin was striped.</i>

15:47.364 --> 15:51.802
<i>All the other zebras
admired his beautiful skin,</i>

15:51.827 --> 15:55.681
<i>and he was proud
to be so different.</i>

15:55.706 --> 16:00.436
<i>But now, they all wanted
to be like him,</i>

16:00.461 --> 16:05.608
<i>so one by one, they swam
in the magic water hole,</i>

16:05.633 --> 16:07.651
<i>and when they came out,</i>

16:07.676 --> 16:09.695
<i>they were all striped, too.</i>

16:09.720 --> 16:12.615
(COUGHS)

16:12.640 --> 16:14.158
So I can get my stripes

16:14.183 --> 16:16.577
and then it will rain.
No, Khumba.

16:16.602 --> 16:17.745
Where is this water hole?

16:17.770 --> 16:19.455
Don't you see?

16:19.480 --> 16:22.066
I think I know.
They all looked the same.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.841
That looks like me, sort of,

16:30.866 --> 16:35.512
and those can be three peaks

16:35.537 --> 16:37.681
leading to a waterhole.

16:37.706 --> 16:39.708
It is a map,
to the magic waterhole.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.396
Mom.

17:02.856 --> 17:03.791
Dad?

17:03.816 --> 17:05.858
Lungisa.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.163
Mama. I'm sorry.

18:05.669 --> 18:06.169
(HOWLS)

18:10.132 --> 18:13.010
Hmm? Water.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.266
KHUMBA: <i>Whoa.</i>

18:26.648 --> 18:29.251
Well, hello there.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.128
Excuse me.
How are you today?

18:31.153 --> 18:32.963
Uh...
Feeling different,

18:32.988 --> 18:35.507
peculiar, left out, having
trouble fitting in?

18:35.532 --> 18:37.092
Am I right?
Well, I...

18:37.117 --> 18:39.136
That's why I'm here.
I'm here to help.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.096
My name is Skalk.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.974
Thanks anyway, Skalk, but you
couldn't possibly know...

18:43.999 --> 18:46.143
You want more stripes,
but you think there's no way

18:46.168 --> 18:48.187
in the world you could
get more stripes.

18:48.212 --> 18:49.855
Am I right? Am I wrong? Am I?

18:49.880 --> 18:51.899
Of course I'm right.

18:51.924 --> 18:54.276
Wrong. I'm going to get my
stripes at the magic waterhole.

18:54.301 --> 18:58.447
Magic waterhole?
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:58.472 --> 19:00.240
Of course, the magic waterhole.

19:00.265 --> 19:03.869
Yep. Just got to figure
out where to head.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.829
Stop, stop, stop.

19:05.854 --> 19:08.290
I've got the answers to all
your problems right here.

19:08.315 --> 19:12.336
Skalk's 100% natural,
herb, miracle formula.

19:12.361 --> 19:15.589
Guaranteed to bring out
the natural stripe in you.

19:15.614 --> 19:18.425
Really? No, no, no, wait. I
know what you're thinking.

19:18.450 --> 19:19.802
How could that be?

19:19.827 --> 19:21.386
But I tell you it works...

19:21.411 --> 19:24.056
on anything.
Even a rock.

19:24.081 --> 19:26.183
Samples of my work right here.

19:26.208 --> 19:29.269
But if you want to trek all the
way across the Karoo and back,

19:29.294 --> 19:30.896
that's all right by me.

19:30.921 --> 19:34.274
Well, maybe if you show me
how it works.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.009
Follow me.

19:45.686 --> 19:50.249
Khumba, I'm so sorry
about your... huh?

19:50.274 --> 19:52.167
Khumba?

19:52.192 --> 19:55.712
So I can have some of your
miracle, natural stuff.

19:55.737 --> 19:58.257
Normally, it's very,
very, very hard to get,

19:58.282 --> 20:00.968
but act now, the miracle
natural stuff is yours

20:00.993 --> 20:04.972
for the shockingly
low price of, say...

20:04.997 --> 20:06.807
a little water
for me and my buddies?

20:06.832 --> 20:09.351
But I don't have any water.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.770
I personally know there's
enough water back at your herd

20:11.795 --> 20:13.730
to give it away.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.732
Saw the wet muzzles
with my own eyes.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.526
Wouldn't hurt for you to ask.

20:17.551 --> 20:19.778
Believe me, it could.

20:19.803 --> 20:23.140
Right now, I'm the last zebra
in the world they want to see.

20:24.892 --> 20:28.453
Skalk? Skalk? Right this way.
(SNARKY LAUGH)

20:28.478 --> 20:30.647
You got to earn those stripes.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.209
Good evening, madam.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.795
What a treat running
into such a lovely lady

20:36.820 --> 20:39.381
on such a lovely evening.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.592
With a fine feather duster,
I might add.

20:41.617 --> 20:44.511
Oh, I'm not
a cleaning implement.

20:44.536 --> 20:46.597
I am an artiste.

20:46.622 --> 20:49.474
I can't think when I last saw
a zebra outside the fence.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.643
Did you hear what he
said about my feathers?

20:51.668 --> 20:53.353
Take him down, Mama V.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.522
But I ain't done
nothing wrong yet.

20:55.547 --> 20:58.483
Does your mother know
you're out here all alone?

20:58.508 --> 21:01.111
My mother died.

21:01.136 --> 21:04.031
Oh.
This is awkward.

21:04.056 --> 21:06.700
I was providing
adult supervision.

21:06.725 --> 21:09.995
Skalk's going to help me get my stripes
with his 100% natural formula.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.580
Hmm.

21:11.605 --> 21:14.583
Really, I know
what you're thinking.

21:14.608 --> 21:17.711
How can I... Need help
closing the deal, Skalk?

21:17.736 --> 21:19.630
Let's do it over dinner.

21:19.655 --> 21:22.424
He's not food. He's
worth a lot of water.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.301
Let's eat him.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.595
Come on, guys. He's our
ticket to all that water

21:26.620 --> 21:29.389
the zebras are hogging. Get behind me.
You, too, you little one.

21:29.414 --> 21:32.351
Looks like we got ourselves
a dog fight, Bradley.

21:32.376 --> 21:33.769
He's going to eat you.

21:33.794 --> 21:34.962
Sorry, kid.
I did my best.

21:38.882 --> 21:40.442
Keep your backs covered.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.944
Well, it's too late
for some of us.

21:41.969 --> 21:43.804
Bradley.
I'm getting my stripes.

21:45.681 --> 21:47.658
I just got to swim
in the magic waterhole.

21:47.683 --> 21:49.534
Ha! Magic.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.536
I'm so thirsty, I'd settle
for any old waterhole.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.580
Right, Mama V?

21:53.605 --> 21:55.123
MAMA V: Where is this waterhole?

21:55.148 --> 21:57.042
Where the mantis said, I guess.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.293
The mantis.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.003
He spoke to you?

22:00.028 --> 22:01.630
KHUMBA: He drew me a map.
(GASPS)

22:01.655 --> 22:03.548
Well, I personally saw
the mantis once.

22:03.573 --> 22:07.177
(YIPES) He was very complimentary
about my feathers.

22:07.202 --> 22:09.304
Maybe not the mantis,
but a mantis.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.849
Okay, yes, a stick insect.

22:12.874 --> 22:15.560
Point is, he liked the feathers.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.646
Go for the hoof.
That's her Achilles' heel.

22:17.671 --> 22:19.773
She's got four of them.
(MAMA V GASPS)

22:19.798 --> 22:22.985
Enough. Mama V
has seen enough.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.936
And keep your left hoof up.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.669
Wait, wait,
I know what you're thinking,

22:40.694 --> 22:42.696
that I messed with the herd.

Thanks. If it wasn't for you,

23:00.797 --> 23:02.482
I would have been dead meat.

Oh!

Now, Khumba...

23:10.724 --> 23:13.410
you're saying you can
get us to a waterhole?

23:13.435 --> 23:15.954
Yeah, and it would be good
to have some company.

23:15.979 --> 23:18.123
How about you just tell us
where it is,

23:18.148 --> 23:20.250
because in my book,
two is company,

23:29.910 --> 23:32.262
So will there be water
at this water hole?

23:32.287 --> 23:34.431
I believe that's the concept.

23:34.456 --> 23:35.766
And is there such a thing

23:35.791 --> 23:37.684
as a magic waterhole?

He was attacked.
A herd of giant wildebeest.

26:44.271 --> 26:46.982
A pack of crazed ostriches.
Show me.

26:53.071 --> 26:57.509
Woo, dragging across the
Karoo is hard work.

26:57.534 --> 26:59.928
You noticed.

26:59.953 --> 27:02.514
<i>And it doesn't help that you can't
find a drop of water to drink.</i>

27:02.539 --> 27:06.351
Without Phango
panting on our way.

27:06.376 --> 27:08.520
You shouldn't scare him
like that, Bradley.

27:08.545 --> 27:10.730
I'm good.

27:10.755 --> 27:13.942
Did you know he eats his pray
while there's still a heart beat?

27:13.967 --> 27:16.528
(IMITATES HEART BEATING)

27:16.553 --> 27:18.154
He feeds off their fear.

27:18.179 --> 27:21.266
That's how he gets his powers.

27:23.351 --> 27:27.272
His supernatural powers.
Enough, Bradley.

27:29.566 --> 27:32.877
Woo, well, it's been a long day.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.362
Let's stop here.

27:38.158 --> 27:42.595
Oh, the life
of a wandering artiste.

27:42.620 --> 27:43.805
Don't you have a home?

27:43.830 --> 27:45.557
Oh, now you've done it.

27:45.582 --> 27:48.351
<i>The farm was my home,</i>

27:48.376 --> 27:51.187
but life can be cruel

27:51.212 --> 27:53.773
when you're a breed apart,

27:53.798 --> 27:57.694
and no one understands
your fab works of art.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.988
I've been persecuted,
stigmatized.

28:00.013 --> 28:03.950
(SINGS) You might think
I've been demoralized.

28:03.975 --> 28:06.494
Oh, yeah.

28:06.519 --> 28:08.371
But I will survive

28:08.396 --> 28:12.876
♫ Although all my life,
I've been ostracized ♫

28:12.901 --> 28:14.294
Oh, shame.
Poor Bradley.

28:14.319 --> 28:16.588
Patronized, decaberized.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.006
That's not even a real word.

28:18.031 --> 28:19.716
Traumatized.

28:19.741 --> 28:23.345
On several occasions,
I've been hospitalized.

28:23.370 --> 28:27.223
♫ What I've been through,
the doctor visualized ♫

28:27.248 --> 28:29.976
♫ Visualized. ♫
I think I get the picture.

28:30.001 --> 28:32.202
I know they all make fun,
but when all is said and done,

28:32.212 --> 28:35.565
I was ostracized.
Oh, really now, Bradley.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.233
Oh, yeah, laugh at me.

28:37.258 --> 28:38.943
Laugh away, make fun.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.154
But when all is said and done,

28:41.179 --> 28:47.869
♫ I was ostracized ♫

28:47.894 --> 28:50.121
Some birds are just
not meant to be caged,

28:50.146 --> 28:51.956
hey, Bradley?

28:51.981 --> 28:53.750
Maybe some birds aren't
meant to be let out.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.710
I...

28:55.735 --> 28:58.238
And you, Mama V? What are
you on the run from?

29:00.448 --> 29:05.929
Well, it's just not that
important where Mama V is from.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.764
Mama V, don't look back.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.891
Our eyes are only
on where we're going.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.601
Right, Mama V?

29:11.626 --> 29:14.646
Sometimes the past
is best left buried.

29:14.671 --> 29:18.733
Now, I think it's time
for some shut-eye.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.319
Night, Bradley.
Night, Mama V.

29:21.344 --> 29:23.947
Night, Khumba.

29:23.972 --> 29:24.973
Night.

29:30.562 --> 29:34.666
Maybe tomorrow we'll find
ourselves a water hole.

29:34.691 --> 29:36.443
A safe one.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.996
(SNIFFS)

29:51.458 --> 29:59.458
Dog, dog, dog.
All I smell is dog.

30:00.467 --> 30:03.111
I can fix that. I've got a natural
blend of herbs and flowers.

30:03.136 --> 30:04.404
I'll go get you some.

30:04.429 --> 30:05.905
It kills nasty odors dead.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.907
It works on dog, cat, dog...

30:07.932 --> 30:09.826
Dead dog?

30:09.851 --> 30:11.561
I'm trying to avoid that.

30:14.898 --> 30:18.293
The Karoo may be
going to the dogs,

30:18.318 --> 30:21.629
but it doesn't mean
I have to eat one.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.324
The heartburn is a killer.

30:34.042 --> 30:35.502
No!

30:40.924 --> 30:42.258
Khumba.

30:54.229 --> 30:57.916
BRADLEY: The Karoo all
looks the same to me.

30:57.941 --> 31:00.251
Did we pass that bush already?

31:00.276 --> 31:02.003
MAMA V: This was
on the map, right?

31:02.028 --> 31:04.047
Yeah, I'm sure we're
going the right way.

31:04.072 --> 31:05.965
You better be sure.

31:05.990 --> 31:08.635
'Cause me feathers
go limp in this kind of heat.

31:08.660 --> 31:12.138
(LICKS) Leave off with
the mothering already.

31:12.163 --> 31:14.891
So you don't want
any of this, huh?

31:14.916 --> 31:16.793
I'm still bloated
from breakfast.

31:18.336 --> 31:19.712
Mmm.

31:33.393 --> 31:37.522
Wow, Tombi
would love it out here.

31:38.773 --> 31:41.042
Oh, hello, hello.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.486
Bradley, I wouldn't.

31:51.119 --> 31:53.705
MAMA V: <i>I told you!</i>

32:05.633 --> 32:08.611
Hey, those three peaks
were definitely on the map.

32:08.636 --> 32:10.346
Come on, Bradley.
Let's go!

32:11.598 --> 32:13.891
Let's go, Bradley.

32:18.271 --> 32:20.748
TOMBI: <i>I saw it
around here somewhere.</i>

32:20.773 --> 32:23.459
With three peaks, I think...

32:23.484 --> 32:26.421
What's this all about?
And it was right there.

32:26.446 --> 32:27.947
Where? There?

32:28.072 --> 32:29.757
<i>Nigel!</i>
Here, there? I'm confused.

32:29.782 --> 32:30.842
(ZEBRAS GROAN)

32:30.867 --> 32:32.010
- Oops.
- Nigel!

32:32.035 --> 32:33.261
You found the map.

32:33.286 --> 32:34.762
Yeah, sorry.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.889
Are you sure
it was a map, Tombi?

32:36.914 --> 32:39.100
Yes, and it had to be
where Khumba was going.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.518
What's that?

32:40.543 --> 32:41.978
There's a rustle.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.283
Phango, he's at the fence again.

32:43.296 --> 32:44.772
Who's at the fence?

32:44.797 --> 32:46.232
Thembe, help me.
It's Seto, quick.

32:46.257 --> 32:47.400
He left the fence?

32:47.425 --> 32:48.843
What was he thinking?

32:51.638 --> 32:54.991
I... I followed
Khumba's tracks

32:55.016 --> 32:57.060
<i>into a dry riverbed.</i>

32:59.145 --> 33:00.955
<i>Only Phango's tracks came out.</i>

33:00.980 --> 33:04.917
So there was... there was
nothing left of him?

33:04.942 --> 33:08.212
With Phango, there never is.

33:08.237 --> 33:09.589
So Khumba is dead then.

33:09.614 --> 33:11.341
But maybe he's still alive.

33:11.366 --> 33:15.244
And he's following the map?

33:18.956 --> 33:23.795
All that we can hope for
is that your friend,

33:23.920 --> 33:28.191
your son, did not die in vain.
Mkhulu.

33:28.216 --> 33:31.611
Seko, wait. Are you
just going to give up?

33:31.636 --> 33:35.198
This is a sad day.
Very sad.

33:35.223 --> 33:36.933
But Mkhulu is right.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.577
Now it will rain. Dad,
how can you say that?

33:39.602 --> 33:42.622
Everyone's thinking it.
I'm just saying it.

33:42.647 --> 33:45.525
Right?
Uh, right, Dad.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.444
Run, run!

34:36.451 --> 34:39.262
MAMA V: Go around.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.554
We got to go through.

34:40.580 --> 34:42.039
And ruin our feathers?

34:43.498 --> 34:45.543
Ostriches first!

34:46.753 --> 34:47.879
You can do it, Bradley!

34:54.010 --> 34:55.762
What's going on?

34:57.305 --> 34:59.490
What is it, Captain?

34:59.515 --> 35:01.033
Zebra crossing.

35:01.058 --> 35:02.785
I don't like it when we stop.

35:02.810 --> 35:04.495
Why the rush, fellows?

35:04.520 --> 35:06.456
Migration season already?

35:06.481 --> 35:08.291
This is an emigration.

35:08.316 --> 35:10.960
What Kress means, madam,
is that we are leaving.

35:10.985 --> 35:12.253
I thought he was Kress.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.671
No, man.
That's Kress.

35:13.696 --> 35:15.256
I'm not Kress.
I'm Freckie.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.507
I'm Kress.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.242
<i>But I'm stuck.</i>

35:20.328 --> 35:22.430
Could you help us
get through the fence?

35:22.455 --> 35:25.933
That's more than a ton
of lifting, Captain.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.894
<i>Help!</i>
Hush, Bradley.

35:27.919 --> 35:29.395
At least.

35:29.420 --> 35:31.047
Right, team.
There's only one way.

35:33.007 --> 35:35.193
Oaks, scrum!

35:35.218 --> 35:36.527
What's that mean, eh?

35:36.552 --> 35:37.653
We breaking for rugby?

35:37.678 --> 35:38.988
Aye, you, too.

35:39.013 --> 35:42.116
Me?
Yeah, get behind uh...

35:42.141 --> 35:44.702
Freckie.
Uh...

35:44.727 --> 35:46.370
Hey, I'm not Freckie.

35:46.395 --> 35:48.439
I'm Freckie.

35:48.564 --> 35:50.924
Let's get on with the emigration.
I thought we were leaving.

35:50.942 --> 35:52.168
Let's get to it.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.986
Why are you leaving?

35:54.111 --> 35:55.963
No water. Yeah, we're in
search of greener pastures.

35:55.988 --> 35:58.382
Freckie!
I'm Freckie.

35:58.407 --> 36:01.511
You, take the left.

36:01.536 --> 36:03.304
(PLUCKING LIKE GUITAR)

36:03.329 --> 36:05.932
Ah, poor Saki.

36:05.957 --> 36:08.601
He lost his brother to Phango
just yesterday.

36:08.626 --> 36:10.978
Not me.
He got Percy.

36:11.003 --> 36:12.688
I'm Percy.
I'm right here!

36:12.713 --> 36:14.440
But that's Percy.

36:14.465 --> 36:15.525
Percy's dead, man.

36:15.550 --> 36:17.610
Hello, I'm alive!

36:17.635 --> 36:19.262
Ah, just scrum!

36:22.348 --> 36:23.766
Dodge.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.562
<i>A little tighter, Saki!</i>

36:30.398 --> 36:32.817
(GRUNTING)

36:34.485 --> 36:37.922
Ah! Can you feel
our power?

36:37.947 --> 36:40.550
Hey, Percy!
You're alive!

36:40.575 --> 36:41.843
Yeah, yeah.

36:41.868 --> 36:43.177
Ah, I love a good scrum.

36:43.202 --> 36:44.262
Hey, Freckie!

36:44.287 --> 36:46.973
I'm Freckie!

36:46.998 --> 36:48.099
That's me.
I'm Freckie.

36:48.124 --> 36:50.184
Bye.
Goodbye.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.395
Stay well, eh?
Look after yourself.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.063
Hey, Percy.

36:54.088 --> 36:56.482
You're alive, Percy.
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

36:56.507 --> 36:58.067
(SHOUTS)

36:58.092 --> 37:00.194
Leave some water
for the rest of us.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.780
Oh, you got mud in my mane.

37:02.805 --> 37:04.640
You got mud in my girl's mane?

37:04.765 --> 37:06.868
(SIGHS) You want some, too, huh?

37:06.893 --> 37:08.102
I can fix that.

37:12.982 --> 37:14.609
Fight, fight, fight!

37:16.485 --> 37:18.880
Hey, watch it.
With some fervor.

37:18.905 --> 37:20.131
Hey, knock it off.

37:20.156 --> 37:21.257
Where's Mkhulu?

37:21.282 --> 37:22.717
What is going on?

37:22.742 --> 37:24.927
Not enough water to go around.

37:24.952 --> 37:26.429
Who almost finished the water?

37:26.454 --> 37:29.056
Well...
I'll handle this, Mkhulu.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.541
I'm in charge now.

37:32.126 --> 37:33.978
Someone has to be in control.

37:34.003 --> 37:35.563
What's happening?

37:35.588 --> 37:37.106
Not so tough, now,
are you, big fella?

37:37.131 --> 37:39.775
<i>Zuki, you're spooking Nigel.</i>

37:39.800 --> 37:42.695
Dad, the waterhole is empty.

37:42.720 --> 37:45.222
Khumba's stripes had nothing
to do with the rains.

37:46.641 --> 37:47.909
We need to leave.

37:47.934 --> 37:49.201
We're leaving?
Khiriki?

37:49.226 --> 37:51.078
And get us all killed?

37:51.103 --> 37:53.331
<i>Now Phango has had
a taste of zebra,</i>

37:53.356 --> 37:55.458
do you think he'll stop
at just one?

37:55.483 --> 37:59.086
Oh, but we're staying.
Staying.

37:59.111 --> 38:02.406
<i>Ow!
No, no biting. Only throwing!</i>

38:06.953 --> 38:09.805
I have seen the magic waterhole.

38:09.830 --> 38:14.393
(SINGS) Hallelujah!

38:14.418 --> 38:16.729
Woo-hoo!

38:16.754 --> 38:19.899
I've got to hand it
to you, Khumba.

38:19.924 --> 38:22.635
You sure are one of a kind.

38:24.470 --> 38:29.909
(SINGS) This is incredible.
I'm feeing the magic.

38:29.934 --> 38:32.353
<i>I'm feeling the magic.</i>

38:34.021 --> 38:36.357
Well, what are you waiting for?

38:56.168 --> 38:58.229
Oh, lovely.

38:58.254 --> 39:00.022
<i>My wandering days are over.</i>

39:00.047 --> 39:03.317
<i>What's everybody looking at?</i>

39:03.342 --> 39:05.945
<i>Who are they?</i>

39:05.970 --> 39:07.488
Hey, hey!

39:07.513 --> 39:09.824
Welcome to
Ying's Animal Sanctuary.

39:09.849 --> 39:13.619
We're the most diverse
species in southern Africa!

39:13.644 --> 39:16.080
I'll take refuge
in this man made...

39:16.105 --> 39:18.207
natural waterhole,

39:18.232 --> 39:20.459
<i>where all worries of Phango
are far from the mind.</i>

39:20.484 --> 39:24.922
Escape with the sublime fusion
of authentic African experience.

39:24.947 --> 39:29.385
Come celebrate the
magnificence that is you!

39:29.410 --> 39:31.345
Don't mind if I do.

39:31.370 --> 39:35.041
<i>Yeah, you that is
our drinking water.</i>

39:40.171 --> 39:42.398
<i>So neat.
Check the coat!</i>

39:42.423 --> 39:44.400
What is that, Dad?
Wow!

39:44.425 --> 39:45.443
<i>I never...</i>

39:45.468 --> 39:47.361
So Afrozan!

39:47.386 --> 39:49.238
He washed his stripes off.

39:49.263 --> 39:50.406
Fascinating.

39:50.431 --> 39:51.991
A natural variation.

39:52.016 --> 39:53.659
Something wrong
with being different?

39:53.684 --> 39:55.578
Nothing wrong at all, Miss.

39:55.603 --> 39:58.622
I'm the only endangered
species in here, you know.

39:58.647 --> 40:00.750
Can't be too many
of you around, are there?

40:00.775 --> 40:02.460
<i>They're going to love you!</i>

40:02.485 --> 40:04.336
That's enough now.

40:04.361 --> 40:06.881
Being unique
comes at a price, though.

40:06.906 --> 40:09.800
Everyone wants a piece
of you, right, mate?

40:09.825 --> 40:13.054
Now, the show
is at five o'clock sharp.

40:13.079 --> 40:15.890
So if you want food,
play to the camera,

40:15.915 --> 40:17.933
be on time, and on your game.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.668
Oh, thanks, but...

Oh, man.

40:21.962 --> 40:24.273

Really?

40:24.298 --> 40:28.444
Yes, right there.
Ooh, child!

while they got to go
to <i>La Abattoir.</i>

40:42.900 --> 40:46.670
Bradley, an abattoir
is a slaughterhouse.

40:46.695 --> 40:48.255
It sounds French.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.882
It must be fancy.

40:49.907 --> 40:51.550
Come on, Bradley.
We have to keep going.

for stardom here.

safe from Phango, little one.

41:16.600 --> 41:20.663
<i>Oh, look. There!</i>

41:20.688 --> 41:22.206
I'm not giving up.

41:22.231 --> 41:24.667
I knew it.

41:24.692 --> 41:26.193
I know it's out there.

Ah, nope.
Not anymore.

41:59.685 --> 42:02.872
Wait! Stuff's about to get real!

42:02.897 --> 42:04.331
What were you going to tell me?

42:04.356 --> 42:06.167
Hey, if you recognize the map,

42:06.192 --> 42:08.043
just tell me where to go.

46:42.342 --> 46:45.404
Then you two grabbed me

46:45.429 --> 46:49.825
and dragged me
all the way to here.

we've been looking for

where we're going?

47:21.548 --> 47:22.733
I don't!

47:22.758 --> 47:24.109
The black eagle knows.

47:24.134 --> 47:25.652
And we know that because...

Because he has
a bird's eye view.

is Ngow Mountain.

(GROWLS)

01:09:13.234 --> 01:09:16.319
In the flesh at last.

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:18.988
(BANG)

01:09:44.598 --> 01:09:47.600
And when they came out,
they were all striped.

01:10:01.574 --> 01:10:06.095
But then...
they all looked the same.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:09.640
But you're not the same,

01:10:09.665 --> 01:10:11.350
are you?

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:14.436
They hardly get
my pulse rate up.

01:10:14.461 --> 01:10:20.818
You are the one I've been waiting for.
(GROWLS)

01:10:20.843 --> 01:10:24.864
It was foretold that a
half-striped zebra would be born,

01:10:24.889 --> 01:10:29.326
and make one of us the most
powerful leopard that ever lived.

01:10:29.351 --> 01:10:30.995
<i>But I killed my own clan</i>

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:34.356
so that I could have you.
(ROARS)

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:08.057
You I'd savor slowly.

01:11:10.559 --> 01:11:14.271
<i>One stripe at a time.</i>

01:11:19.902 --> 01:11:22.029
Whoa!
(GROWLS)

01:11:33.332 --> 01:11:37.728
You are the half, the half
that will complete me.

01:11:37.753 --> 01:11:40.606
You can't change
what you are, Phango.

01:11:40.631 --> 01:11:43.676
There's only one way
to find out.

01:12:31.015 --> 01:12:33.492
Dad, look.
What's happening?

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:36.687
(CRACKING, SHAKING)

01:12:38.022 --> 01:12:40.416
Oh, I think that's my cue.

01:12:40.441 --> 01:12:42.126
No, Khumba!

01:12:42.151 --> 01:12:43.777
It's too late.
Run!

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.510
<i>Look, look!</i>

01:12:51.535 --> 01:12:52.636
<i>It's the water!</i>

01:12:52.661 --> 01:12:53.662
What is that?

01:12:59.334 --> 01:13:02.104
Look at all that water!

01:13:02.129 --> 01:13:04.339
Where is it all coming from?

01:13:06.842 --> 01:13:07.885
Look, it's Phango!

01:13:12.181 --> 01:13:13.073
<i>Khumba!</i>

01:13:13.098 --> 01:13:14.491
Oh.

01:13:14.516 --> 01:13:16.326
<i>He's going to eat Khumba!</i>

01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:18.937
You're getting
under my skin, Khumba.

01:13:26.779 --> 01:13:28.405
MAMA V: <i>Hold on, Khumba!</i>

01:13:39.291 --> 01:13:40.959
Oh, hey.
Oh, no, Khumba!

01:13:42.628 --> 01:13:45.089
Surrender to your destiny.

01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:52.362
Killing me won't make
a difference, Phango.

01:13:52.387 --> 01:13:55.265
Well, eating you will!

01:13:59.978 --> 01:14:00.813
Watch out!

01:14:04.691 --> 01:14:05.400
Khumba!

01:14:18.831 --> 01:14:21.141
Don't look, kids.
(CRASH)

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:23.143
Nice knowing you.

01:14:23.168 --> 01:14:25.479
He's... he's dead?

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:27.089
He could have survived.

01:14:29.133 --> 01:14:32.136
No, he's dead.

01:14:44.773 --> 01:14:45.983
Khumba, no!

01:15:11.925 --> 01:15:13.760
(WHIMPERING) Khumba.

01:15:15.179 --> 01:15:17.514
Khumba?
Khumba?

01:15:59.431 --> 01:16:03.619
(GASPS, COUGHS)

01:16:03.644 --> 01:16:05.621
Khumba.

01:16:05.646 --> 01:16:07.164
<i>He's alive!</i>

01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:08.273
My son.

01:16:09.775 --> 01:16:13.212
Boy, you scared me to... (LAUGHS)

01:16:13.237 --> 01:16:16.340
He's alive.
Khumba's alive.

01:16:16.365 --> 01:16:17.966
He's alright.

01:16:17.991 --> 01:16:20.761
That's my mate.
Fellow survivor.

01:16:20.786 --> 01:16:23.013
Way to go, little buddy,
pull through.

01:16:23.038 --> 01:16:26.208
I thought I'd lost you, too.

01:16:27.834 --> 01:16:33.732
<i>He's alive! Yay!</i>

01:16:33.757 --> 01:16:35.108
Khumba, yeah!

01:16:35.133 --> 01:16:36.610
I'm spitting on myself.

01:16:36.635 --> 01:16:38.887
It's wet.
Oh, it's rain!

01:16:40.514 --> 01:16:43.517
He did it.
He sure did, my girl.

01:16:55.112 --> 01:16:57.422
Four is definitely a crowd.

01:16:57.447 --> 01:16:59.049
Does this mean
we're friends again?

01:16:59.074 --> 01:17:02.719
You think I'd let you
get away that easy?

01:17:02.744 --> 01:17:04.204
You okay?

01:17:09.251 --> 01:17:10.502
More than okay.

01:17:13.672 --> 01:17:15.774
I wouldn't change a thing.

01:17:15.799 --> 01:17:19.111
(CHEERING, CHATTERING)

01:17:19.136 --> 01:17:21.430
Just like the old days, hey?

01:17:39.197 --> 01:17:40.907
Heads up, Tombi.
<i>Game on!</i>

01:17:44.119 --> 01:17:46.847
Nice play, sis. Not
bad for a girl, huh?

01:17:46.872 --> 01:17:48.332
<i>You got to keep
your eye on the ball.</i>

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:50.934
<i>Nice one, Khumba!</i>

01:17:50.959 --> 01:17:52.294
Stay clear of that horn.

01:17:55.547 --> 01:17:56.940
<i>Pass it!</i>

01:17:56.965 --> 01:17:58.050
All right!

01:17:59.885 --> 01:18:02.321
(MUTTERING)

01:18:02.346 --> 01:18:05.098
Come on.
Pom-poms higher!

01:18:07.059 --> 01:18:09.578
Nora incoming!

01:18:09.603 --> 01:18:13.915
Oy, tackle Nora. Or, we
all get another timeout

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.710
Come along, little ones.

01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:18.670
Let 'em stay.

01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:21.590
I'll sing you one, if you
sing me one of your songs.

01:18:21.615 --> 01:18:22.824
Hit it, boys!

01:18:24.618 --> 01:18:26.386
Your ball, Nigel!
It's your ball.

01:18:26.411 --> 01:18:30.140
It's coming to me.
It's coming straight for me.

01:18:30.165 --> 01:18:31.600
Got it.

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:32.768
Come on, mate.

01:18:32.793 --> 01:18:34.211
<i>Go for it, Nigel.</i>

01:18:41.551 --> 01:18:42.903
Score!

01:18:42.928 --> 01:18:44.279
<i>Beautiful!</i>

01:18:44.304 --> 01:18:46.515
Out!
It was in.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.910
Are you kidding me? It
was totally in. Out!

01:18:49.935 --> 01:18:51.620
Or in. Or out.

01:18:51.645 --> 01:18:53.397
I don't know.

01:18:56.691 --> 01:18:59.086
KHUMBA: <i>You know,
some things do change.</i>

01:18:59.111 --> 01:19:01.338
<i>But not always in the way
you expect it.</i>

01:19:01.363 --> 01:19:05.242
<i>And it helps having a little
push in the right direction.</i>
