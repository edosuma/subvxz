00:37.244 --> 00:39.591
- Are you sure you're
gonna go through with this?

00:39.591 --> 00:41.834
- Of course, I have to.

00:41.834 --> 00:44.389
- You don't
have to do anything.

00:44.389 --> 00:46.046
I mean, you don't know this guy.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.564
He could be a creep.

00:47.564 --> 00:49.739
Or worse, a mass murderer.

00:51.913 --> 00:53.432
- Well you know what, I want to.

00:53.432 --> 00:56.263
And besides, my love life
has nothing to do with you.

00:57.229 --> 00:59.404
And Brian is not
a mass murderer.

00:59.404 --> 01:01.682
- I'm just saying,
just because he's a Christian

01:01.682 --> 01:03.580
doesn't mean he's
on the up and up.

01:03.580 --> 01:05.789
I mean, I'm sure
Jesus trusted Judas

01:05.789 --> 01:08.758
and we know how that worked
out, Ms. Christian Connection--

01:08.758 --> 01:10.277
- Okay, just shut up.

01:10.277 --> 01:11.485
- Well, I'm
just saying why would you

01:11.485 --> 01:13.383
invite him here for
your first date?

01:13.383 --> 01:15.316
I mean, what are you thinking?

01:15.316 --> 01:16.973
Gosh, it's like you might as
well have a welcome banner

01:16.973 --> 01:19.665
that says, "Happy
date rape, Brian."

01:19.665 --> 01:21.702
- Enough, Amanda, okay?

01:21.702 --> 01:24.843
I have enough problems
trying to go out in public

01:24.843 --> 01:26.086
and you should know that.

01:28.364 --> 01:31.021
- I'm sorry,
of course I do.

01:31.021 --> 01:33.507
I'm just trying to protect you.

01:33.507 --> 01:35.647
- I know you are, but I just...

01:38.201 --> 01:39.064
I feel like...

01:41.135 --> 01:42.688
I don't know,

01:42.688 --> 01:45.001
I feel like I just need
some normalcy in my life.

01:47.314 --> 01:49.109
And I feel like Brian.

01:52.733 --> 01:55.874
I feel like Brian could be
the beginning of it, you know?

02:05.677 --> 02:09.025
- Look, I don't
support the decision,

02:09.025 --> 02:11.061
but I support you.

02:11.061 --> 02:12.822
You hard up broad, you.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.584
- You're such a bitch.

02:54.104 --> 02:56.590
- Okay, well just
give me the safe word.

02:56.590 --> 02:57.832
- What?

02:57.832 --> 03:00.352
- You
know, a safe word.

03:00.352 --> 03:03.217
Like if he ends up being
a creep or something,

03:03.217 --> 03:06.841
you say the safe word, I
come out, I freak him out,

03:06.841 --> 03:08.705
freak him out and
he goes home early.

03:08.705 --> 03:10.155
- You will freak him out.

03:11.605 --> 03:12.675
I...

03:12.675 --> 03:13.848
Shit.

03:13.848 --> 03:14.987
- Safe word.
- Oh my god, okay.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.680
- Safe word.
- Um, I, blueberry pie.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.681
- Okay.

03:18.681 --> 03:20.200
- Okay.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.063
I'm all right, I'm together.

03:22.063 --> 03:22.892
Mandy?

03:24.894 --> 03:26.861
I just wanna say thank you.

03:26.861 --> 03:28.104
- Of course.

03:28.104 --> 03:29.864
What are sisters for?

03:41.013 --> 03:42.118
- Angelina, I presume.

03:45.915 --> 03:48.538
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

03:49.746 --> 03:51.265
- Yes.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.473
I'm sorry.

03:52.473 --> 03:53.543
- That's all right.
- I'm an idiot.

03:53.543 --> 03:55.718
- No, no you're not, I'm Brian.

03:55.718 --> 03:57.237
Nice to meet you.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.653
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you as well.

03:59.653 --> 04:01.344
- You too.
- Thank you.

04:01.344 --> 04:02.587
- You look really good.

04:02.587 --> 04:04.071
- Thanks.

04:04.071 --> 04:06.522
You look even more beautiful
than your profile image.

04:06.522 --> 04:07.488
- That's so sweet.

04:08.938 --> 04:10.319
Would you like to come in?

04:10.319 --> 04:11.975
- I'd love to come
in, thank you.

04:13.839 --> 04:15.255
Beautiful place you got.

04:17.601 --> 04:19.914
- So,
you're nervous too?

04:19.914 --> 04:21.295
- Can you tell?

04:21.295 --> 04:24.091
Yeah, it's not like I
do this all the time.

04:24.091 --> 04:26.266
I'm really scared to death.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.786
You know, you could be a
mass murderer for all I know.

04:29.786 --> 04:31.892
- That's so weird
that you say that.

04:31.892 --> 04:35.275
My sister was just saying
the exact same thing.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.448
- Your sister?
- Mm-hmm.

04:36.448 --> 04:38.623
- Will she be joining us?

04:38.623 --> 04:39.555
- No, no.

04:39.555 --> 04:41.833
She won't be here tonight.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.075
- Okay.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.561
So, what's on the
agenda for tonight?

04:45.561 --> 04:48.218
Maybe a hot game
of Naked Twister?

04:49.150 --> 04:50.013
- Excuse me?

04:51.221 --> 04:53.638
- I'm sorry, that was
totally inappropriate.

04:53.638 --> 04:55.709
I am really bad
at telling jokes.

04:55.709 --> 04:58.539
I just want to apologize
for being so bad at it.

05:04.787 --> 05:09.101
- Tonight, I wanted to
scare the pants off of you.

05:12.933 --> 05:14.279
- Oh.

05:14.279 --> 05:15.936
You're talking about
horror films, right?

05:17.351 --> 05:20.320
I just, I don't really do
well with horror films.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.597
It's really not my thing.

05:23.012 --> 05:25.808
Maybe you have a nice, I
don't know, faith-based film

05:25.808 --> 05:28.707
or a feel-good film we could
watch, something like that?

05:28.707 --> 05:29.536
- Really?

05:31.607 --> 05:33.712
- I guess I must've
misread your profile

05:33.712 --> 05:35.680
on Christian
Connection, I'm sorry.

05:35.680 --> 05:36.508
- No.

05:39.131 --> 05:44.033
Actually, I have a
confession to make.

05:44.861 --> 05:46.346
- So, here it goes.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.176
You're gonna tell me you're
not a Christian, right?

05:49.176 --> 05:52.144
I'm sorry, that's
it, I can't do this.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.353
- Really?

05:53.353 --> 05:56.148
I just wanted to
meet someone nice.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.012
- You know I'm joking, right?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.601
- You're a jerk.

06:00.601 --> 06:02.120
- You're right, I am a jerk.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.639
I'm really terrible
with jokes too.

06:03.639 --> 06:04.916
- You really are.

06:04.916 --> 06:07.090
- I know, I gotta stop
writing my own jokes.

06:08.506 --> 06:11.405
I tell you what, I'll make
a little deal with you.

06:13.959 --> 06:16.652
Why don't we sit down and
watch your horror films,

06:16.652 --> 06:20.034
I'll sit through all of
them, and at the end of it,

06:20.034 --> 06:21.173
give me a little kiss.

06:23.659 --> 06:25.074
- But I don't even know you.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.663
- I know, but we're not talking

06:27.663 --> 06:30.010
about like steaming up
the room or windows.

06:30.010 --> 06:33.289
I'm just talking like a
little peck on the cheek.

06:33.289 --> 06:34.186
Let's make a deal.

06:35.256 --> 06:36.499
- Okay, it's a deal.

06:36.499 --> 06:38.052
- All right, cool.

06:38.052 --> 06:39.502
Let's make it official.

06:39.502 --> 06:40.503
Pinky swear?

06:43.126 --> 06:44.645
All right.

06:44.645 --> 06:46.958
Let's watch those horror films.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.254
- Hey, hey, the good stuff,
good stuff, good stuff.

07:07.254 --> 07:09.394
- No, get the fuck out.

07:09.394 --> 07:10.671
- Hey look man, look, look,

07:10.671 --> 07:11.879
come on, you know
I'm good for it, man.

07:11.879 --> 07:12.673
Come on, talk to me, all right?

07:12.673 --> 07:14.641
- I said fuck off.

07:14.641 --> 07:15.987
- Look, man, look, I got
something for real now.

07:15.987 --> 07:17.747
Look, help me out, man.

07:17.747 --> 07:20.163
I just need a
little help, look...

07:20.163 --> 07:21.613
Oh come on, man.

07:21.613 --> 07:23.995
- Good for nothing creep,
that is what you are.

07:23.995 --> 07:26.411
If my brothers catch you here,

07:26.411 --> 07:28.758
we will mop the shit out
of you like housekeeping.

07:28.758 --> 07:30.864
You are worse for wear.

07:30.864 --> 07:33.729
- Look, man, look, I got
this score all right, look.

07:33.729 --> 07:35.627
You know I'm good for it.

07:35.627 --> 07:36.904
Just give me till Monday
and I'll have it here

07:36.904 --> 07:39.355
delivered to your
doorstep, I swear.

07:39.355 --> 07:40.425
Just give me this chance, man.

07:40.425 --> 07:43.255
- Why do you think I'd help you?

07:43.255 --> 07:45.361
- Look, I just got
this score, all right?

07:45.361 --> 07:49.572
Look, cash in, cash out, I'm
paying you in full in hand.

07:49.572 --> 07:50.573
Look, you...

07:55.302 --> 07:58.029
- Not anymore,
you piece of shit.

07:58.961 --> 08:00.963
I'm not gonna look.

08:00.963 --> 08:03.241
Looking for everything, me.

08:04.656 --> 08:08.798
Or I will find you and I
will carve out your eyes.

08:10.869 --> 08:12.077
- Okay.

08:12.077 --> 08:13.631
Okay.

08:13.631 --> 08:14.494
Okay.

08:19.222 --> 08:21.501
- Now fuck off.

08:43.005 --> 08:45.386
- Lightweight.
- Here stick, stick.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.735
- Don't waste that shit.
- Fuck y'all.

08:48.735 --> 08:51.738
- Fuck off, man, it's
not my first rodeo.

08:51.738 --> 08:54.430
- Oh, oh oh oh, look at
this bitch right here.

08:54.430 --> 08:55.535
Look at that fucking cunt.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.328
See that shit?

08:57.398 --> 08:58.503
Fucking cunt.

09:00.988 --> 09:03.508
- How do you know
she's a fucking cunt?

09:03.508 --> 09:07.408
- How do you
know what she's driving?

09:13.553 --> 09:14.864
- Fucking bitch.

09:16.659 --> 09:18.005
- Let's get high.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.734
- Rick.

09:22.734 --> 09:23.597
- In the kitchen.

09:31.536 --> 09:33.573
You've been gone a long time.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.057
Did you get his wine?

09:35.057 --> 09:36.472
- Yup.

09:36.472 --> 09:37.715
I got your wine.

09:37.715 --> 09:39.613
- It's not my wine,
it's his wine.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.891
What time is he gonna be here?

09:43.824 --> 09:45.999
What time is he gonna be here?

09:46.896 --> 09:48.139
- Pa's gonna be here at six.

09:48.139 --> 09:49.934
- All right, great, thanks.

09:56.181 --> 09:57.562
- Holy shit.
- Whoa.

09:58.839 --> 10:00.427
What the fuck, man?

10:00.427 --> 10:02.809
How many people fucking
live in this house?

10:02.809 --> 10:04.465
Is she expecting
company or what?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.849
- Fuck, I don't know
who the fuck that is.

10:08.849 --> 10:10.057
- Fuck this, Dan.

10:10.057 --> 10:11.438
Let's just go fucking
hit another house.

10:11.438 --> 10:12.957
They piss gold
over in West Side.

10:12.957 --> 10:14.199
- Yeah.

10:14.199 --> 10:16.616
- Hey hey hey. We stick
to this fucking plan.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.135
We stick to this fucking
house, you understand?

10:19.135 --> 10:20.861
- All right.

10:20.861 --> 10:22.035
- How do you know they
have money anyway?

10:22.035 --> 10:23.484
- Oh, they do.

10:23.484 --> 10:24.934
- Yeah, well how do you know?

10:26.626 --> 10:27.799
Hello--

10:27.799 --> 10:29.076
- Hey, it's because
I fucking know.

10:29.076 --> 10:31.458
All right, that bitch is
a fucking bank manager.

10:32.355 --> 10:33.184
Fuck.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.705
- Stop wasting gas,
just what we need--

10:36.705 --> 10:37.947
- Jesus Christ.

10:42.296 --> 10:44.333
- Whoa whoa whoa, hey now.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.473
Who do you think I am,
Dean Martin or something?

10:46.473 --> 10:47.439
- Really, Dad?

10:47.439 --> 10:49.407
Two glasses are gonna kill you?

10:49.407 --> 10:54.239
- Yeah, drink up, she
went all over town for it.

10:55.206 --> 10:56.725
- Really?

10:56.725 --> 10:58.865
If that's the case, you can
top that baby off, sweetheart.

11:02.144 --> 11:03.524
Hey wait a minute here.

11:03.524 --> 11:04.974
You go through all this trouble

11:04.974 --> 11:07.080
and you're not gonna have
a drink with us, hon?

11:08.391 --> 11:11.429
- Well, I can't right now, Dad.

11:12.533 --> 11:15.467
- Goddamn, I'm
gonna be a grandpa.

11:21.819 --> 11:23.993
Great news and
congratulations, you two.

11:25.823 --> 11:26.686
- Cheers.

11:28.584 --> 11:30.482
- What the fuck's
going on in there?

11:31.621 --> 11:33.209
- Probably in there jerking off.

11:34.314 --> 11:36.592
- Sit the fuck
down, Jesus Christ.

11:36.592 --> 11:38.905
- Oh, we don't wanna miss that.

11:38.905 --> 11:40.458
We should probably hit 'em now.

11:42.253 --> 11:43.254
- Sit.

11:43.254 --> 11:44.565
Sit.

11:44.565 --> 11:46.464
- You know you love it.

11:51.020 --> 11:52.194
Let's do this.

11:52.194 --> 11:53.816
- Shut the fuck up, Mitch.

11:53.816 --> 11:55.956
You sit the fuck back.

11:55.956 --> 11:58.441
- All right, shit.

11:58.441 --> 11:59.442
- We go in
when I say we go in.

12:01.997 --> 12:02.929
- All right.

12:02.929 --> 12:05.000
- Fucking say it, Dolores.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.312
- We go in when
you fucking go in.

12:09.004 --> 12:10.868
Good enough, captain?

12:16.701 --> 12:21.292
- So, have you made maternity
arrangements at the banks?

12:21.292 --> 12:22.811
Yeah, of course.

12:22.811 --> 12:26.228
I mean, it's not due till
August, but it's all set.

12:26.228 --> 12:28.023
- And the plant, Rick?

12:28.023 --> 12:30.611
- Yeah, the plant,
I don't want to...

12:30.611 --> 12:31.958
Let's not talk about it.

12:31.958 --> 12:33.511
- Dammit, Rick.

12:33.511 --> 12:36.341
- Dad, it's
okay, we're gonna be okay.

12:37.446 --> 12:41.139
- Mr. Weniger, Friday
is my last day.

12:41.139 --> 12:42.727
- Oh, that's just great.

12:42.727 --> 12:44.004
What was it this time?

12:44.004 --> 12:46.041
No, shit, I don't
even wanna know.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.461
- Look--
- No, you look.

12:52.461 --> 12:55.291
Ever since you
got back from war,

12:55.291 --> 12:56.810
you've had problems
with authority,

12:56.810 --> 12:59.433
you've had problems
with your temper.

12:59.433 --> 13:02.091
You're just not the same Rick
that married my little girl.

13:02.091 --> 13:05.094
- It's
complicated, all right?

13:05.094 --> 13:06.406
- Complicated?

13:06.406 --> 13:08.442
Let me tell you
about complicated.

13:09.581 --> 13:13.344
In '67, my platoon
was patrolling

13:13.344 --> 13:15.346
a small village
outside of Saigon.

13:16.761 --> 13:17.969
And all of a sudden,

13:17.969 --> 13:20.006
Charlie encroached us
from our east flank.

13:21.110 --> 13:23.112
You know, I was
greener than bird shit

13:23.112 --> 13:25.011
on my first tour duty.

13:25.011 --> 13:26.357
I almost pissed myself.

13:27.807 --> 13:32.812
Then, old Hopper from Dallas
came out and he dragged me

13:33.951 --> 13:35.573
into a villager
hut to take cover.

13:37.023 --> 13:39.025
I honestly didn't
know what I was doing.

13:41.717 --> 13:45.272
Well, I hear footsteps
outside the hut.

13:46.480 --> 13:49.138
So I slide on my
bayonet and I wait.

13:51.347 --> 13:54.350
All of a sudden out of nowhere,
this little Vietnamese girl,

13:54.350 --> 13:56.387
hell, she couldn't have
been much older than 10,

13:56.387 --> 13:58.768
runs in, shouting at
the top of her lungs.

14:00.184 --> 14:02.427
Now, I didn't know if she was
getting in position or what.

14:04.188 --> 14:06.535
I didn't speak the language.

14:07.916 --> 14:10.677
So I take out my bayonet
and I plunge it in her neck

14:10.677 --> 14:11.851
and I twisted it.

14:13.991 --> 14:16.890
And that sweet little girl,
she fell into my hands.

14:18.409 --> 14:22.482
She looked up at me as
though she was saying, "Why?"

14:24.277 --> 14:26.244
For the love of
God, what did I do?

14:26.244 --> 14:28.522
- Dad, that is enough.
- No.

14:28.522 --> 14:29.316
Finish.

14:31.008 --> 14:32.526
- Charlie passes.

14:32.526 --> 14:34.632
We go out and attack them.

14:34.632 --> 14:36.220
So I carry this
girl out of the hut

14:36.220 --> 14:38.049
and I place a little rag I found

14:38.049 --> 14:39.533
in the hut over her face.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.572
But as I get up, my
commanding officer comes out

14:43.572 --> 14:45.746
and he just punches
my lights out.

14:47.817 --> 14:51.787
So, when I come to, old
Hopper picks me up on my feet.

14:53.202 --> 14:55.929
And I asked him, "What the
hell's the matter with him?

14:55.929 --> 14:57.724
"She was tipping off Charlie."

14:59.760 --> 15:04.041
Old Hopper looked at me
and he said, "No, Al, no.

15:05.283 --> 15:07.768
"She was just scared and
crying for her mama."

15:09.184 --> 15:10.944
See, we were in her home.

15:12.463 --> 15:14.396
- Jesus, Jesus.

15:14.396 --> 15:16.225
- So you try rolling
through airports

15:16.225 --> 15:18.469
and having people yell
baby-killer to you

15:18.469 --> 15:21.368
knowing what I did.

15:21.368 --> 15:23.025
You know, we did
some good over there,

15:23.025 --> 15:25.407
but damn if we didn't
come home with some pain.

15:27.064 --> 15:28.513
It was a simple mistake.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.104
Reckon it's one I've lived
with for over 30 years.

15:33.104 --> 15:35.313
- But you keep on living.

15:35.313 --> 15:37.212
- That's the point, Rick.

15:37.212 --> 15:39.145
Move forward and keep living.

15:40.353 --> 15:42.838
- That is enough horror
stories for me tonight.

15:42.838 --> 15:44.426
You want dessert?

15:44.426 --> 15:46.152
- I'm gonna get a drink.

16:04.239 --> 16:05.757
- It's time.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.106
- It's about.

16:45.418 --> 16:48.421
- Hello, is someone in there?

16:48.421 --> 16:49.870
Excuse me.

16:49.870 --> 16:50.733
Hello?

16:51.976 --> 16:52.804
Please.

16:53.771 --> 16:55.842
My boyfriend just hit me.

16:55.842 --> 16:57.326
I just wanna use your phone.

16:57.326 --> 16:59.984
I got out of the car and
I ran, I don't know...

16:59.984 --> 17:00.916
Please.

17:00.916 --> 17:02.297
- You expecting company, Rick?

17:03.436 --> 17:05.334
- Look, we
can call 911 for you.

17:05.334 --> 17:06.887
- I have
nowhere to go.

17:06.887 --> 17:08.786
- Rick, open the door.
- He's gonna kill me.

17:08.786 --> 17:10.029
- Rick, open the door.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.651
Open the goddamn
door for the girl.

17:11.651 --> 17:13.756
- Please.

17:13.756 --> 17:15.378
- Come on in.
- Are you okay?

17:15.378 --> 17:17.174
- And then I just
got out of the car...

17:17.174 --> 17:18.898
- Are you okay,
are you all right?

17:18.898 --> 17:20.590
- I'm okay, but you're not.

17:21.592 --> 17:22.420
- Oh my god.

17:23.973 --> 17:24.973
- What the--

17:31.050 --> 17:33.121
- No, no, no, no.
- Bitch.

17:35.261 --> 17:38.505
- We don't want your wallet.
- Take my money.

17:38.505 --> 17:40.335
- What are you talking about?
- Take my wallet.

17:41.543 --> 17:43.062
- Fuck these punks.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.511
They're not getting a thing.

17:45.892 --> 17:47.135
- Really, got
something to say there, punk?

17:47.135 --> 17:49.723
- Fuck off, Dolores.
- Aw.

17:49.723 --> 17:51.208
- Let her go.

17:51.208 --> 17:52.105
Let her go.

17:53.969 --> 17:54.901
Let her go.

17:57.145 --> 17:58.007
Stop it.

17:59.975 --> 18:00.872
- Zero fucks given.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.495
Trust in me, Pops.

18:02.495 --> 18:06.085
- Oh guys, guys, guys,
let's just ease this tension

18:06.085 --> 18:07.396
with a little song.

18:07.396 --> 18:08.639
- Think about
what you're doing.

18:08.639 --> 18:10.641
- Smoking rocks is always fun.

18:11.814 --> 18:13.920
- What the fuck are you doing?

18:13.920 --> 18:15.163
Put down the goddamn guitar.

18:15.163 --> 18:16.647
Get to work.

18:16.647 --> 18:17.648
Get to work.

18:19.995 --> 18:22.894
- Rick, Rick, you look like
a man that might have a safe,

18:22.894 --> 18:25.276
where you keep
all your trinkets.

18:28.383 --> 18:30.385
- Take my wallet.

18:31.420 --> 18:33.422
- Aw that's sweet.

18:39.290 --> 18:41.258
- I'm trying to tell you.

18:41.258 --> 18:43.398
- I'll just
fucking cut you.

18:43.398 --> 18:47.160
If you don't cooperate,
I'll slit her throat.

18:48.541 --> 18:50.163
Come on, let's get him up.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.406
Let's get going.

18:51.406 --> 18:52.510
- On your knees.

18:52.510 --> 18:53.925
On your knees.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.617
- Come on, Rick, come on.

18:55.617 --> 18:57.170
Just be nice.

18:57.170 --> 19:00.069
Give us some help
with the fog, Rick.

19:00.069 --> 19:01.623
- Come to the foyer.

19:01.623 --> 19:03.349
- I'll babysit, guys.

19:07.732 --> 19:09.217
- No.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.366
- Get your ass to sit.

19:20.366 --> 19:22.022
Woo hoo.

19:22.022 --> 19:24.059
All right, butt plug,
what's the combo?

19:28.097 --> 19:30.238
- Here.

19:30.238 --> 19:31.100
Here.

19:32.792 --> 19:33.620
And maybe.

19:37.245 --> 19:38.384
- Help.

19:38.384 --> 19:39.730
Someone, please.

19:41.766 --> 19:43.285
- Now there's boss.

19:43.285 --> 19:46.288
- I wanna fuck you, come here.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:47.565 --> 19:48.842
No, no, no, no.

19:50.499 --> 19:51.328
- Seven.

19:52.329 --> 19:53.226
No, I'm wrong.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.503
11.

19:54.503 --> 19:57.679
- She's with child,
you goddamn monster.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.961
- No, no, no, no, no.

20:03.961 --> 20:04.789
- No wonder she's so hot.

20:05.825 --> 20:07.930
Yeah, I'm fucking her, yeah.

20:07.930 --> 20:08.759
- 18.

20:14.972 --> 20:17.043
- You fucking slut.

20:42.827 --> 20:44.726
- Come on, come on, come on.

20:44.726 --> 20:45.692
- 74.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.662
- Yes.

20:49.662 --> 20:53.597
- You ruined it, you
ruined it for me.

20:58.774 --> 21:00.673
- So, who's the Marine?

21:30.599 --> 21:33.119
- You dirty bastard.

21:45.614 --> 21:46.546
- Get up, soldier.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.828
- Your pop is--

22:01.492 --> 22:04.668
- Is that the fucking
best you can do?

22:07.049 --> 22:07.878
Come on.

23:11.873 --> 23:14.427
- But
you keep on living.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.325
That's the point, Rick.

23:16.325 --> 23:18.155
Move forward and keep living.

23:24.610 --> 23:25.921
- That was a trip.

23:25.921 --> 23:28.510
- You can say that again.

23:28.510 --> 23:29.718
Why don't you sit closer to me?

23:29.718 --> 23:32.134
I mean, just in
case you get scared.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.137
- I'm gonna go get
us some popcorn.

23:37.070 --> 23:42.075
- Sure.

23:59.334 --> 24:01.198
- Charge said to him,
"Okay, come back in 10 years

24:01.198 --> 24:02.855
"and get your car."

24:02.855 --> 24:05.444
"And he said, morning
or afternoon?"

24:08.964 --> 24:13.072
And the fella behind
the counter said,

24:13.072 --> 24:16.765
"Well, 10 years from now,
what difference does it make?"

24:16.765 --> 24:19.285
And he said, "Well,
the plumber's coming
in the morning."

24:51.766 --> 24:54.493
- Audrey, Clay, Toby,
come and get it.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.805
- Hey, you hear your
mother, move it.

24:56.805 --> 24:59.394
- Mom, Audrey keeps hogging
the goddamn bathroom.

24:59.394 --> 25:01.154
- Clay, language.

25:01.154 --> 25:04.088
- For Christ's sake, Carol,
he'll be an adult in six months.

25:04.088 --> 25:05.193
- Hell yeah, Dad.

25:06.090 --> 25:07.126
- Don't push it, Clay

25:08.334 --> 25:10.405
- Mom, Dad, can I
please have this?

25:11.751 --> 25:13.132
- What the hell is this?

25:13.132 --> 25:15.410
- A sea critter, Dad,
they're really cool.

25:15.410 --> 25:16.238
- Stupid.

25:16.238 --> 25:17.516
- Shut up, Clay.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.758
- Sea what?

25:18.758 --> 25:21.278
- No, Mom, it's a sea
critter that you feed

25:21.278 --> 25:22.866
and take care of.

25:22.866 --> 25:24.315
- Take care of?

25:24.315 --> 25:25.834
You've barely started
wiping your own butt, champ

25:25.834 --> 25:27.491
and you wanna take
care of something?

25:27.491 --> 25:28.319
Ha.

25:29.493 --> 25:31.046
- Honey, right now we
really can't afford

25:31.046 --> 25:33.393
to buy an aquarium,
and fish, food,

25:33.393 --> 25:35.913
and all it takes
to care for fish.

25:35.913 --> 25:37.087
- Right.

25:37.087 --> 25:39.814
- Really, Dad,
they're only $1.25.

25:39.814 --> 25:43.369
And he comes with everything
it takes to care for him.

25:43.369 --> 25:45.682
- It would help him learn
about responsibility.

25:46.648 --> 25:47.615
- All right.

25:47.615 --> 25:48.961
Here's the deal.

25:51.170 --> 25:54.691
You wash the car the
next two Saturdays.

25:56.106 --> 25:57.383
- Deal.

25:57.383 --> 25:58.902
Oh, I need another
buck for shipping.

26:35.283 --> 26:36.111
Yes.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.563
They're here, they're here.

26:39.563 --> 26:40.840
- What's that, honey?

26:40.840 --> 26:43.084
- My sea critters
came in the mail.

26:43.084 --> 26:44.603
- That's nice, honey.

27:15.219 --> 27:18.947
- Boy, I can't wait
to give you a name.

27:30.131 --> 27:31.408
Clay, you jerk.

27:31.408 --> 27:32.858
- Clay, leave your
brother alone.

27:32.858 --> 27:34.791
- Loser.

27:34.791 --> 27:36.068
- Shut it, now.

27:38.484 --> 27:41.521
- Mom, I don't understand.

27:41.521 --> 27:43.731
I did everything
right, and nothing.

27:45.215 --> 27:46.630
- Are you sure?

27:46.630 --> 27:47.424
- Yes.

27:49.633 --> 27:53.672
- Well, maybe you
got a bad egg, baby.

27:57.020 --> 28:00.402
Go get ready for school and
I'll see if Dad will chip in

28:00.402 --> 28:02.784
on another order
of those things.

28:02.784 --> 28:04.855
- Really?
- Really.

28:04.855 --> 28:05.684
- Cool.

28:12.414 --> 28:15.832
- We can forget all
about you, you bastard.

28:31.848 --> 28:33.401
- May I be excused?

28:33.401 --> 28:34.229
- Yeah.

28:35.817 --> 28:38.337
- Toby, hold up a second.

28:39.614 --> 28:41.512
Let's go upstairs
and talk in the tent.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.412
Come on, little man.

28:53.490 --> 28:55.734
- What do you want
to talk about, Dad?

28:57.666 --> 29:01.222
- Mom told me about
your little fish.

29:01.222 --> 29:02.637
- It wasn't a fish.

29:02.637 --> 29:04.432
It was a sea critter.

29:04.432 --> 29:07.021
- All right, all right, my bad.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.749
Well anyway, she mentioned
that you were real down

29:10.749 --> 29:12.716
and out about this whole
subject and she thought

29:12.716 --> 29:14.960
that I should talk to
you about raising pets.

29:16.168 --> 29:18.204
- I tried, Dad.

29:19.067 --> 29:21.035
- Hey, you tried.

29:21.035 --> 29:22.036
That's what matters.

29:22.899 --> 29:25.315
Come on, look at me, man.

29:26.281 --> 29:30.285
Besides, you got off easy.

29:31.873 --> 29:33.185
- What do you mean?

29:34.531 --> 29:36.188
- Since you've been
alive and a member

29:36.188 --> 29:40.088
of this entire family, do you
recall us ever owning a pet?

29:41.745 --> 29:43.402
Ask your brother.

29:43.402 --> 29:44.299
Ask your sister.

29:45.887 --> 29:47.716
They'll both give
you the same answer.

29:48.683 --> 29:49.788
Do you wanna know why?

29:51.444 --> 29:52.998
Because of Tippy.

29:52.998 --> 29:54.275
- Who?

29:54.275 --> 29:57.002
- Tippy was a bull
terrier that I had

29:57.002 --> 29:59.176
when I was about your age.

29:59.176 --> 30:01.351
We went everywhere together.

30:01.351 --> 30:03.629
Now, she then tried
to go to school

30:03.629 --> 30:04.837
with me almost every day.

30:06.425 --> 30:07.564
- What happened?

30:09.911 --> 30:14.295
- What happened was, pardon
my French, someone gave birth

30:14.295 --> 30:19.127
to the nastiest,
soulless, witch from hell.

30:21.060 --> 30:22.579
Ms. Hart.

30:22.579 --> 30:24.650
She had it out for old
Tips when she was a pup.

30:24.650 --> 30:26.928
Well one day, I came
home from school

30:26.928 --> 30:29.862
and my mom tells me that
Tippy attacked the old bat.

30:31.036 --> 30:33.693
Well, it was a false
accusation, of course.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.800
But she had friends
visiting from out of town

30:36.800 --> 30:38.112
who backed her story

30:38.112 --> 30:40.355
and also claimed getting
attacked themselves.

30:42.564 --> 30:44.049
Hart was in good with the city.

30:45.498 --> 30:49.951
So they put an order out to
capture Tippy and put her down.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.229
- You didn't let them, right?

30:52.229 --> 30:53.748
- Hell no.

30:53.748 --> 30:56.716
There was this wood area back
behind my parents' house.

30:56.716 --> 30:59.547
I took Tippy deep into
those woods and tied her up.

31:00.962 --> 31:04.276
I went back into the city and
it was like she'd ran away.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.867
I mean, hearing that
old girl whimpering

31:08.867 --> 31:12.560
and howling into the
night, every night.

31:15.356 --> 31:18.048
That's when I knew she'd
never be happy again.

31:18.048 --> 31:18.877
Have no freedom.

31:20.809 --> 31:24.503
She even started to
develop an infection

31:24.503 --> 31:26.022
from the collar rubbing.

31:26.022 --> 31:28.334
She tried to free herself
to come back to me.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.786
- Just cut her loose.

31:31.786 --> 31:34.996
- Would've done it if I could.

31:34.996 --> 31:36.756
She would've come back to me.

31:36.756 --> 31:37.965
- What did you do?

31:39.414 --> 31:42.866
- One day after school, I went
to see Tippy one last time.

31:45.110 --> 31:49.493
Only this time, I brought
my dad's old Remington.

31:52.911 --> 31:56.811
I let her loose to watch her
run and play in the pasture.

32:04.543 --> 32:06.096
And then I took that Remington.

32:11.101 --> 32:12.758
I pointed it between her eyes.

32:20.766 --> 32:25.633
Bam.

32:25.633 --> 32:28.049
And that's all I have to
say on the subject of pets.

32:28.049 --> 32:30.741
Now go brush your teeth
and get ready for bed.

32:39.854 --> 32:41.476
Grandma's coming
for the weekend.

32:43.340 --> 32:44.755
- Oh.

32:44.755 --> 32:45.756
What a delight.

32:56.767 --> 32:59.149
- So, how did everyone's day go?

33:00.426 --> 33:02.152
- I crapped myself once today.

33:02.152 --> 33:03.947
- Grandma, that is gross.

33:03.947 --> 33:07.330
- He asked.
- So anyways, Larry Henderson

33:07.330 --> 33:09.125
got his butt kicked
behind the gym today.

33:09.125 --> 33:10.712
- And that's something
to gloat about?

33:10.712 --> 33:12.300
- He
probably had it coming.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.716
- Mother,
you're not helping.

33:14.716 --> 33:18.858
- You call me Sandra,
or Mrs. O'Connor.

33:18.858 --> 33:20.205
- Ma.
- Well, she is.

33:20.205 --> 33:22.414
- When are you
gonna start popping

33:22.414 --> 33:24.209
out those great
grand babies, huh?

33:24.209 --> 33:25.934
- Grandma.
- Donald.

33:25.934 --> 33:27.143
- Ma.
- What?

33:27.143 --> 33:28.903
It's the natural thing to do.

33:28.903 --> 33:31.388
- Ma, she's only 18 years old.

33:31.388 --> 33:34.426
- I was just a year
older when I had you.

33:34.426 --> 33:37.498
Oh, and if I hadn't had
that back alley abortion

33:37.498 --> 33:40.535
a year after, why, you'd
have a half-black brother

33:40.535 --> 33:43.676
from boxer Joe Lewis.

33:43.676 --> 33:45.057
- Ma, you
know that's not true.

33:46.127 --> 33:47.818
- Grandma was a player.

33:49.820 --> 33:50.856
- Maybe.

33:50.856 --> 33:52.547
- I don't believe it.

33:52.547 --> 33:53.652
- I'm through.

33:53.652 --> 33:55.516
I'm gonna go work on my ride.

33:55.516 --> 33:56.724
- How's that going, son?

33:56.724 --> 33:58.070
- Do you know how much...

33:59.623 --> 34:02.178
How many girls I'm
gonna escort home

34:02.178 --> 34:04.042
once I fix my fuel pump?

34:05.284 --> 34:07.148
Do you mind if I'm excused?

34:07.148 --> 34:08.286
- Yes, you may.

34:10.496 --> 34:13.327
- Grandma, you up for
a game of checkers?

34:13.327 --> 34:15.190
- Toby, you know you
have to help with dishes.

34:15.190 --> 34:16.467
- Oh nonsense.

34:16.467 --> 34:19.195
That is work for the
woman of the house.

34:19.195 --> 34:23.061
- Look, Sandra, we're trying
to teach Toby responsibility.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.545
- Ah, horseshit, we're
playing checkers.

34:25.545 --> 34:28.306
Oh, as soon as I
watch my Henny Ben.

34:28.306 --> 34:29.652
- Cool.

34:29.652 --> 34:32.449
- Well, I have to go
get ready for a date.

34:32.449 --> 34:33.933
- With whom?

34:33.933 --> 34:35.452
- Johnny. I met him three
days ago at a protest.

34:35.452 --> 34:37.109
- Oh Jesus.

34:37.109 --> 34:38.317
- We're just going for a ride.

34:38.317 --> 34:39.422
I'll be back early.

34:39.422 --> 34:41.734
Grandma.

34:41.734 --> 34:43.391
He is a decent guy.

34:43.391 --> 34:45.324
Really, you should
see him with his kids.

34:45.324 --> 34:46.255
- Oh Jesus.

34:48.224 --> 34:49.466
I need a hot shower.

34:50.536 --> 34:51.364
And a drink.

34:52.641 --> 34:54.540
Ma, you know you don't smoke.

34:56.542 --> 34:58.441
- Cheer up, Grandpa.

35:00.028 --> 35:02.307
Toby, set up the
checkers in your room

35:02.307 --> 35:03.998
and I'll be down in 30.

35:03.998 --> 35:05.172
- Yes, ma'am.

35:05.172 --> 35:07.588
- And you, you get your
ass on them dishes.

35:08.761 --> 35:10.384
I thought I smoked.

35:10.384 --> 35:11.316
Do I smoke?

35:25.399 --> 35:27.055
- Call me now.

35:27.055 --> 35:30.128
And let's be that
there is ka-mel-ah.

35:57.189 --> 35:58.604
- Son of a bitch.

36:02.988 --> 36:07.061
I swear, if I have to
call the plumber again.

36:11.169 --> 36:16.174
- Ma...

36:19.453 --> 36:21.075
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

36:23.215 --> 36:24.182
- What's up, buddy?

36:24.182 --> 36:25.631
I'm a little busy right now.

36:25.631 --> 36:27.046
- Something got Mom.

36:27.046 --> 36:28.496
It grabbed her from the sink.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.568
- Sorry, buddy.

36:32.845 --> 36:33.915
Can't quite hear you.

36:34.778 --> 36:36.504
Wait until I get out.

36:36.504 --> 36:37.333
- Okay.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.247
- Are you perfect?

36:55.247 --> 36:56.352
Are you in pain?

36:59.458 --> 37:01.564
- Grandpa, where you been?

37:03.255 --> 37:04.774
Oh, the store.

37:04.774 --> 37:08.226
Did you remember to bring me
my chocolate bar with almonds?

37:09.882 --> 37:13.196
Oh, you brought me one of
those on our very first date.

37:13.196 --> 37:16.095
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

37:16.095 --> 37:18.512
I opened the door, and
you were standing there

37:18.512 --> 37:20.238
in your Navy uniform.

37:21.515 --> 37:24.276
So tall, so handsome.

37:24.276 --> 37:27.348
Ah, just took my breath away.

37:27.348 --> 37:29.385
Oh, and then afterwards
we went dancing.

37:29.385 --> 37:32.733
That big band sound
was something.

37:32.733 --> 37:34.217
Afterwards, you took me home.

37:35.149 --> 37:36.668
It was so romantic.

37:36.668 --> 37:40.982
Full moon, you held me in
your arms and kissed me.

37:40.982 --> 37:43.019
I knew you were the one for me.

37:45.608 --> 37:46.471
Oh, Grandpa.

37:48.473 --> 37:50.268
Where'd you go?

37:52.339 --> 37:53.961
Why'd you leave me?

37:54.962 --> 37:58.276
I miss you so much.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.242
I love you.

38:00.416 --> 38:02.003
Where are you?

38:02.003 --> 38:03.660
Where are you?

38:03.660 --> 38:04.834
Where are you?

38:06.491 --> 38:08.286
Oh, you went to the store.

38:10.149 --> 38:13.014
Remember to bring me that
chocolate bar with almonds.

38:21.747 --> 38:23.231
- Grandma, Grandma.

38:23.231 --> 38:24.474
- Who the hell are you?

38:24.474 --> 38:26.614
- Grandma, it's me,
Toby, your grandson.

38:26.614 --> 38:30.238
- No, I heard about you
creeps on 60 Minutes.

38:30.238 --> 38:34.381
Coming to bleed me dry
of my social security.

38:34.381 --> 38:35.243
- Grandma?

38:54.642 --> 38:57.196
- Audrey, we've dry-humped
for three days now.

38:58.681 --> 39:00.061
I'm really starting to chafe.

39:00.061 --> 39:03.479
- I'm sorry, Johnny, I'm
just nervous, I guess.

39:05.308 --> 39:06.447
Do you have protection?

39:07.345 --> 39:08.518
- Sure, baby.

39:08.518 --> 39:10.417
I always carry a
crowbar in case we run

39:10.417 --> 39:13.281
into a pack of undesirables.

39:13.281 --> 39:15.007
- Jerk, you know what I mean.

39:20.219 --> 39:21.462
What the hell is that?

39:21.462 --> 39:23.119
- Some Spanish fly.

39:23.119 --> 39:25.086
You know, to get
you in the mood.

39:26.571 --> 39:28.158
- I don't know.

39:28.158 --> 39:30.816
- So, baby, just pop
it in your mouth,

39:30.816 --> 39:32.024
down it with this wine.

39:33.094 --> 39:34.510
- Then what?

39:34.510 --> 39:36.926
- Didn't you say your
parents were sound sleepers?

39:37.892 --> 39:39.066
- I don't know, Johnny.

39:40.205 --> 39:42.345
- Come on, baby,
just drink it down,

39:42.345 --> 39:45.831
go up to your room,
and unlock your window.

39:47.730 --> 39:48.558
- Okay.

39:52.459 --> 39:53.632
- There we go.

39:58.672 --> 39:59.949
And Audrey?

39:59.949 --> 40:01.157
Put on something sexy.

40:09.510 --> 40:10.718
- See, Grandma?

40:13.825 --> 40:15.827
- It's starting to
come back to me now.

40:17.898 --> 40:18.933
Who are you again?

40:37.918 --> 40:39.506
- Johnny.

40:40.368 --> 40:41.162
Johnny.

40:48.273 --> 40:49.447
- You see, Grandma?

40:49.447 --> 40:50.724
It took her.

40:50.724 --> 40:52.726
I bet it was that sea critter.

40:52.726 --> 40:53.934
- Ugh.

40:53.934 --> 40:56.108
What I see is that
your mom is a real pig.

40:57.903 --> 40:59.526
- Come on, let's check on Clay.

40:59.526 --> 41:01.976
- Toby, what the hell did
you say that thing was?

41:09.501 --> 41:11.952
- I hope you didn't
start without me.

41:17.198 --> 41:20.581
You're into some kinky
shit, aren't you?

41:21.720 --> 41:23.032
Thank you, Spanish fly.

41:25.724 --> 41:29.417
What the?

41:29.417 --> 41:31.247
What's under here?

41:31.247 --> 41:32.662
Audrey, I didn't
know you had a cat.

41:42.430 --> 41:43.984
- It got him too.

41:43.984 --> 41:44.812
- What did?

41:44.812 --> 41:45.882
- The sea critter.

41:45.882 --> 41:46.952
I know it.

41:46.952 --> 41:49.023
Come on, let's get Dad.

41:49.023 --> 41:51.025
- Toby, why don't
we go get your dad?

41:52.510 --> 41:54.270
I just don't know, Toby, I
mean we looked in the sink

41:54.270 --> 41:55.927
and all I say was
like a bunch of mess

41:55.927 --> 41:56.893
and then we went into
the garage and then--

41:56.893 --> 41:58.377
- Whoa, whoa, hold the phone,

41:58.377 --> 42:00.518
and what the hell are
you two babbling about?

42:00.518 --> 42:04.142
- Dad, that sea critter that
Mom flushed awhile back?

42:04.142 --> 42:05.902
Well, it came back.

42:05.902 --> 42:09.527
It's bigger, meaner, and
eating everyone in the house.

42:09.527 --> 42:13.427
It got Mom, it got
Clay, maybe even Audrey.

42:15.636 --> 42:17.431
- What he said.

42:17.431 --> 42:18.674
Donnie, look in the sink.

42:18.674 --> 42:21.746
- Yeah, Dad,
look in the sink.

42:25.612 --> 42:26.716
- Let's go find everyone.

42:26.716 --> 42:28.200
- They're gone, Dad.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.650
- We'll see about that, come on.

42:29.650 --> 42:30.513
I'm gonna get my gun.

43:04.892 --> 43:06.653
- Donnie,
what are you gonna do?

43:06.653 --> 43:07.792
- Screw this.

43:07.792 --> 43:09.103
I'm gonna call the cops.

43:09.103 --> 43:10.588
- You should call the cops.

43:17.664 --> 43:18.526
Don?

43:20.598 --> 43:21.426
- Dad?

43:24.291 --> 43:25.637
Dad.

43:25.637 --> 43:26.638
Dad.

43:26.638 --> 43:27.501
Dad.

43:28.606 --> 43:29.434
Dad.

43:30.366 --> 43:31.367
Dad.

43:31.367 --> 43:32.333
Dad.

43:32.333 --> 43:33.749
Dad.

43:33.749 --> 43:34.612
Dad.

43:38.374 --> 43:39.789
- Back, I say, back.

43:41.791 --> 43:43.137
Toby, hold this, hold on.

43:43.137 --> 43:45.036
I've got something
for that shit-head.

43:46.451 --> 43:47.832
- Get back.

43:47.832 --> 43:49.350
Grandma.

43:49.350 --> 43:50.904
Get back, get back.

43:53.147 --> 43:53.976
Get back.

43:55.115 --> 43:57.082
Grandma, kill it.

44:04.193 --> 44:06.126
- Burn in hell, fucker.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.329
- Is this your residence?

44:37.329 --> 44:38.745
- You got a warrant?

44:38.745 --> 44:41.748
- No, Grandma,
they're here to help.

44:43.094 --> 44:46.338
- We got a 911 call
reported some screams coming

44:46.338 --> 44:47.823
from this here residence.

44:47.823 --> 44:49.376
Y'all know anything about that?

44:51.033 --> 44:54.588
- Well, apparently there's
a whole lot of shit going on

44:54.588 --> 44:55.969
and we're here to
keep the peace.

44:55.969 --> 44:58.523
- Hey, peace this, copper.

44:58.523 --> 45:00.663
You got nothing on us.

45:03.735 --> 45:08.740
- Son, your grandma, well she's
not doing well, I take it.

45:09.430 --> 45:10.362
Hm?

45:10.362 --> 45:13.469
- Mister, you have to help us.

45:13.469 --> 45:15.436
You have to kill it.

45:15.436 --> 45:16.955
- Well hold on, hold on now.

45:17.922 --> 45:20.062
Kill exactly what?

45:20.062 --> 45:22.133
- Sheriff, please.

45:22.133 --> 45:23.651
It's in our house.

45:23.651 --> 45:26.793
Ate my mom, dad, and brother.

45:26.793 --> 45:28.104
Help us.

45:30.244 --> 45:34.870
- All right, kid, so
where is this intruder at?

45:34.870 --> 45:38.459
- My grandma sprayed it with
hairspray and it ran away.

45:40.841 --> 45:42.118
I have a sister.

45:42.118 --> 45:43.982
This is her boyfriend's
car, sheriff.

45:47.537 --> 45:49.229
- Have you seen her recently?

45:49.229 --> 45:50.057
- No.

45:54.924 --> 45:55.891
- Show us her room.

46:13.771 --> 46:15.255
- We have probable
cause and we're coming

46:15.255 --> 46:18.776
in there whether
you like it or not.

46:34.930 --> 46:36.138
- Toby, in here, quick.

46:36.138 --> 46:40.073
Oh my god, baby, baby,
are you all right?

46:40.073 --> 46:43.214
Oh my god, my--
- What are we going to do now?

46:43.214 --> 46:46.217
- I don't know, I
don't know, I don't...

46:47.874 --> 46:52.810
- You must learn to start
grabbing the fly by the balls

46:52.810 --> 46:54.639
and squeeze, squeeze, I say.

46:57.400 --> 46:58.229
Squeeze.

47:00.748 --> 47:02.060
- Wait a minute.

47:03.821 --> 47:06.271
You said that thing was
a sea creature, right?

47:09.378 --> 47:10.206
Right.

47:12.484 --> 47:14.832
It belongs in the sea.

47:14.832 --> 47:19.043
So, we will give him the sea.

47:19.043 --> 47:20.458
- How does this work?

47:22.978 --> 47:24.911
- Now, Toby, this is where

47:24.911 --> 47:27.672
you're gonna have
to be brave, okay?

47:27.672 --> 47:29.708
What I need you to
do is I need you

47:29.708 --> 47:30.986
to go down into
your sister's room--

47:30.986 --> 47:32.401
- No, Grandma, I'm scared.

47:32.401 --> 47:35.197
- Now, Toby, this
thing was your pet.

47:35.197 --> 47:37.164
Accept the responsibility.

47:37.164 --> 47:39.063
- Grandma, this
thing's a murderer.

47:39.063 --> 47:40.547
- Well, get mad.

47:40.547 --> 47:42.514
I mean, hell, he killed your
father and your brother,

47:42.514 --> 47:46.173
and I mean, who knows what
it did to your sister.

47:46.173 --> 47:47.865
- It took Mom too.

47:47.865 --> 47:50.315
- Well, Donnie
could've remarried.

47:51.765 --> 47:52.731
- Grandma.

47:54.975 --> 47:58.013
So, I bring this thing here.

47:58.013 --> 47:59.531
What are you going to do?

47:59.531 --> 48:00.843
- You just bring it here

48:02.258 --> 48:06.780
and I will stick a lightning
bolt up its puckered ass.

48:14.408 --> 48:16.686
Run, Toby, run,
run, hurry, hurry.

48:16.686 --> 48:18.240
Toby, I want you
to get on the tub,

48:18.240 --> 48:19.931
balance yourself on that ledge.

48:19.931 --> 48:20.794
- Why?

48:20.794 --> 48:22.002
- Bait.

48:22.002 --> 48:23.901
Get your ass up there
or we're both gonna die.

48:23.901 --> 48:24.763
Move, move, move.

48:27.076 --> 48:28.146
All right.

48:35.291 --> 48:36.534
Eat lead, bozo.

48:38.467 --> 48:40.848
Oh yeah, die.

48:40.848 --> 48:44.059
Ugly asshole.

48:44.059 --> 48:45.232
Die, die, die.

48:47.234 --> 48:48.926
Ah shit.

48:57.210 --> 49:01.628
Stay away from my grandson,
you salty son of a bitch.

49:22.373 --> 49:24.547
Oh, Toby, Toby, it's dead.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.171
It's dead.

49:29.104 --> 49:30.312
We won.

49:30.312 --> 49:31.554
We won.

49:31.554 --> 49:34.937
Oh yeah, oh yeah,
we won, we won.

49:34.937 --> 49:36.939
Oh yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.

49:38.147 --> 49:38.976
Oh man.

50:32.477 --> 50:35.170
- Now now, it's almost time.

50:35.170 --> 50:37.034
- Time for what, Grandma?

50:37.034 --> 50:40.175
- Why, for my great
grand babies, of course.

50:48.493 --> 50:50.875
- Wow.
- That was awesome.

50:50.875 --> 50:52.394
What did you think?

50:55.155 --> 50:57.813
- I can see myself in your eyes.

51:00.678 --> 51:03.060
- You know what, I think
that's the pizza guy.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.371
I ordered pizza earlier.

51:04.371 --> 51:06.097
Do you think you can get it?

51:06.097 --> 51:08.065
- I don't mind at all.

51:08.065 --> 51:09.169
I'll be right back.

51:09.169 --> 51:10.032
- Thanks.

51:15.417 --> 51:17.004
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:17.004 --> 51:19.006
- Pepperoni and sausage.

51:22.009 --> 51:24.495
- At least we know
she likes meat, right?

51:24.495 --> 51:25.392
How much do we owe you?

51:25.392 --> 51:26.704
- 21.

51:26.704 --> 51:27.877
- Here you go.

51:30.880 --> 51:34.470
- Holy shit, are you guys
watching a fucking horror movie?

51:34.470 --> 51:39.165
- Yeah, we guys are watching
a fucking horror movie.

51:39.165 --> 51:41.926
- Won't you guys need company?

51:41.926 --> 51:43.134
- You're kidding, right?

51:43.134 --> 51:44.135
Does it look like
we need company?

51:44.135 --> 51:45.481
- I get off in five minutes.

51:45.481 --> 51:47.276
- You know what,
and in five minutes,

51:47.276 --> 51:49.416
you can march your sorry
ass to your fucking house

51:49.416 --> 51:51.556
and never see us again,
how's that sound?

51:51.556 --> 51:52.730
- Well, what about my tip?

51:52.730 --> 51:53.696
- Oh, your tip?

51:53.696 --> 51:55.629
Here's your fucking tip.

51:55.629 --> 51:56.872
Use it well, all right?

51:56.872 --> 51:58.529
- Motherfucker.
- See ya, fuck you.

52:00.289 --> 52:01.083
Pizza's here.

52:28.006 --> 52:29.146
- Well, yeah.

52:29.146 --> 52:30.768
I think that I
need a little time.

52:31.803 --> 52:33.184
- What?

52:33.184 --> 52:35.324
You put me through
all this bullshit

52:35.324 --> 52:36.912
and now you're dumping me?

52:36.912 --> 52:38.845
- No, don't you dare
put this all on me.

52:38.845 --> 52:41.088
- What am I supposed
to do, turn my head

52:41.088 --> 52:44.540
against your all on
the road womanizing?

52:44.540 --> 52:47.681
- Okay, I understand that
traveling may be an issue but--

52:47.681 --> 52:49.131
- Don't but me.

52:49.131 --> 52:52.686
You come home at odd
hours of the night,

52:52.686 --> 52:57.657
clean your clothes, and
then erase your inbox daily.

52:58.554 --> 53:00.763
Oh, oh, and here's the clincher.

53:00.763 --> 53:03.283
Panties in your glove box.

53:03.283 --> 53:04.457
- I explained that.

53:04.457 --> 53:07.011
- Ah, I met your sister.

53:07.011 --> 53:11.118
If she wore those, she'd be
blue from the waist down.

53:11.118 --> 53:12.292
- I break up with you

53:12.292 --> 53:14.156
and now you wanna
take shots at Martha?

53:14.156 --> 53:17.021
- Don't turn this around,
I'm just calling bullshit.

53:17.021 --> 53:19.713
- Look, it's late and I'm in
the middle of Bumfuck, USA

53:19.713 --> 53:22.371
trying to get to this seminar
I don't even want to go to.

53:22.371 --> 53:24.649
And I'm fighting with you now?

53:24.649 --> 53:25.754
Hello?

53:25.754 --> 53:26.582
Kitty?

53:27.825 --> 53:28.653
Fuck.

53:45.118 --> 53:45.946
Fuck.

53:47.845 --> 53:48.673
Dammit.

54:01.272 --> 54:02.239
Fuck.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.586
You've got to be kidding me.

54:04.586 --> 54:06.312
You've got to be kidding me.

54:15.735 --> 54:17.323
Fucking rental car.

55:12.516 --> 55:14.345
What the fuck is that?

55:16.347 --> 55:19.350
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

56:51.994 --> 56:52.823
Hello.

56:54.065 --> 56:55.239
Anybody home?

56:56.930 --> 56:58.311
Hello, I need a phone.

57:01.970 --> 57:04.662
It's 10 o'clock, where
the hell is everybody?

57:04.662 --> 57:07.078
Hello?

57:08.701 --> 57:09.564
Knock knock.

57:12.290 --> 57:14.051
What the fuck is this?

57:14.051 --> 57:16.778
Hello.

57:58.198 --> 57:59.476
There, you see?

57:59.476 --> 58:01.995
Maybe my luck's turning around.

58:21.877 --> 58:22.706
Dammit.

58:24.604 --> 58:25.467
Hello.

58:29.126 --> 58:30.092
Need a little help.

58:42.933 --> 58:44.072
Whoa.

58:44.072 --> 58:45.314
Fuck that shit.

59:08.406 --> 59:10.374
Excuse me, sir, I need a phone.

59:10.374 --> 59:11.444
I need a little help.

59:15.655 --> 59:17.208
- Look who has arrived.

59:18.278 --> 59:20.211
If it ain't the
goddamn guest of honor.

59:21.799 --> 59:22.938
How you doing, friend?

59:24.457 --> 59:25.976
Why don't you come
join the lamb feed?

59:25.976 --> 59:27.287
- No, you don't
understand, I'm stranded.

59:27.287 --> 59:28.116
I need a phone.

59:28.116 --> 59:29.566
- No no no no, you come.

59:29.566 --> 59:30.497
Okay?

59:30.497 --> 59:32.258
Have a good time.

59:32.258 --> 59:35.641
We all here to have a good time.

59:36.814 --> 59:39.196
- Thanks for the invite
to the Mayberry Mixer,

59:39.196 --> 59:40.507
but no thanks, I really
just need a phone, man.

59:40.507 --> 59:43.407
- Will you just come in, okay?

59:43.407 --> 59:44.684
We got a phone.

59:44.684 --> 59:46.928
A matter of fact, we've
got lots of phones.

59:46.928 --> 59:49.033
But first, we celebrate.

59:51.104 --> 59:53.624
- Smells like a carnival
shithouse out here.

59:53.624 --> 59:54.763
- My name is Wicker.

59:55.902 --> 59:57.801
Like the chair.

59:57.801 --> 59:59.009
Like the basket.

59:59.009 --> 01:00:00.493
- Like a phone?

01:00:00.493 --> 01:00:01.701
Really, I'm charmed.

01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:03.669
- You know, sure do
got a smart mouth.

01:00:03.669 --> 01:00:04.946
But that's okay.

01:00:04.946 --> 01:00:06.672
You know what I like
about smart mouths?

01:00:06.672 --> 01:00:07.845
- What's that?

01:00:09.053 --> 01:00:11.193
- I like to wash 'em out.

01:00:13.057 --> 01:00:16.578
Now let's go get ourselves a
drink and calm down, sea boy.

01:00:16.578 --> 01:00:18.131
Have a good time.

01:00:18.131 --> 01:00:19.754
Come on, let's go.

01:00:19.754 --> 01:00:20.617
Okay?

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:42.086
- Whoa, hey, great shindig.

01:00:42.086 --> 01:00:43.053
Now where's that phone?

01:00:43.053 --> 01:00:45.020
- So, you like what you see?

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.090
- No, I mean...

01:00:47.782 --> 01:00:48.645
Kinda.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.198
- 'Cause they like you.

01:00:50.198 --> 01:00:51.751
They like you.

01:00:51.751 --> 01:00:53.511
That's what I see.

01:00:54.478 --> 01:00:55.652
Filthy sluts.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.619
- Whoa, okay, where's
that phone at?

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:00.657
- Yeah, okay.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.245
I get phone.

01:01:04.626 --> 01:01:05.454
But you.

01:01:07.767 --> 01:01:08.872
You drink up.

01:01:11.598 --> 01:01:12.669
Sip on this.

01:01:28.512 --> 01:01:29.824
- What the hell?

01:01:38.246 --> 01:01:41.180
- I killed my
dog about eight years old.

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.597
- Excuse me?

01:01:44.597 --> 01:01:46.116
- You're excused.

01:01:46.116 --> 01:01:49.395
I said I killed my
dog when I was eight.

01:01:50.637 --> 01:01:54.745
I took a rock, hit
him upside his head.

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:56.195
- So you had anger issues.

01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:58.335
- It wasn't anger.

01:01:58.335 --> 01:02:00.786
I loved that dang dog.

01:02:00.786 --> 01:02:01.856
This was yearning.

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:05.825
- Yearning for what exactly?

01:02:08.276 --> 01:02:12.004
- I had what Mama
called the yearning.

01:02:14.282 --> 01:02:15.524
I had it real bad.

01:02:17.803 --> 01:02:18.838
- Old-timer, I
don't know if I like

01:02:18.838 --> 01:02:21.047
this conversation too much.

01:02:21.047 --> 01:02:25.224
- You know, Mama used to
say that the gall bladder

01:02:25.224 --> 01:02:28.848
of a living thing
was the best eating.

01:02:30.574 --> 01:02:32.369
The most powerful eating.

01:02:33.439 --> 01:02:34.992
- I see you've met my pa.

01:02:36.131 --> 01:02:38.375
- Yeah, he's a
real humanitarian.

01:02:38.375 --> 01:02:39.825
- He is, ain't he?

01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:44.070
Did Pa tell you
that he was a medic

01:02:45.175 --> 01:02:46.763
in the Special
Forces back in Nam?

01:02:48.143 --> 01:02:49.766
But he got discharged.

01:02:51.733 --> 01:02:53.666
On account of too much yearning.

01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:54.632
- That's disgusting.

01:02:56.531 --> 01:02:57.912
- Nam was different.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.431
It was me or them.

01:03:04.746 --> 01:03:08.267
I see you have a bit
of yearning in you.

01:03:09.475 --> 01:03:11.442
- Yeah,
you could say that.

01:03:11.442 --> 01:03:13.341
- Well, so do I.

01:03:13.341 --> 01:03:15.412
- Oh, you're insane, man.

01:03:32.739 --> 01:03:33.568
Bathroom?

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:36.813
Bathroom?

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:01.699
Fuck.

01:04:03.115 --> 01:04:05.117
Fucking poisoned my ass.

01:04:12.641 --> 01:04:13.815
Stay together.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.198
Get it together.

01:04:17.198 --> 01:04:19.372
Mitchell, get it together.

01:04:31.453 --> 01:04:32.869
Fucking assholes.

01:04:36.596 --> 01:04:39.013
Come on, focus, focus, focus.

01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:42.223
Okay.

01:04:42.223 --> 01:04:44.363
You can do this.

01:04:44.363 --> 01:04:45.536
Okay.

Okay.

01:05:01.759 --> 01:05:02.899
Okay.

01:06:54.389 --> 01:06:55.252
- Shut up.

01:06:55.252 --> 01:06:56.598
Shut up.

01:06:56.598 --> 01:06:57.427
Shut up.

01:08:39.563 --> 01:08:41.117
- Remember me?

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.395
- This is not the
car I requested.

01:08:43.395 --> 01:08:46.674
I specifically requested
a black Cadillac.

01:08:48.952 --> 01:08:49.849
That's all you have?

01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:50.678
- Yes.

01:08:54.337 --> 01:08:55.683
- Fucking country fuck.

01:08:58.893 --> 01:09:00.100
- You city fuck.

01:09:10.767 --> 01:09:12.595
- Nobody fucking move.

01:09:15.081 --> 01:09:16.703
- Thank God.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:20.777
You sick sons of bitches.

01:09:23.435 --> 01:09:25.988
Dispatch, I need all units
to the hall immediately.

01:09:28.992 --> 01:09:30.442
I had a sneaking
suspicion something weird

01:09:30.442 --> 01:09:32.270
was going on here
and I was right.

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:35.550
- Well then, why
don't you go ahead

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:38.345
and put a bullet right here.

01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:41.935
- Don't mind if I do.

01:09:41.935 --> 01:09:42.764
Bang.

01:09:44.697 --> 01:09:45.939
Bang.

01:09:48.839 --> 01:09:51.359
I thought you guys
wouldn't start without me.

01:09:53.671 --> 01:09:55.260
Son, you're fucked.

01:09:58.815 --> 01:10:03.820
- God, no.

01:10:04.269 --> 01:10:04.959
- Pow.

01:10:14.486 --> 01:10:17.903
- All right, buddy boy,

01:10:21.665 --> 01:10:25.013

01:10:25.013 --> 01:10:28.120
