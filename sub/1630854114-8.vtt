<i>Previously on</i>
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.526 --> 00:07.094
Now, watch your step.
We're almost there.

00:07.224 --> 00:09.661
- I know where we are, Bob.
- No, you don't.

00:09.792 --> 00:12.577
It is the warehouse you want
to throw away our home for.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.797
Not throw away, but good guess.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.886
- Are you ready?
- Sure.

00:17.756 --> 00:20.629
- Ugh.
- Ta-da!

00:20.759 --> 00:22.326
Oh, my God.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.981
I know it needs work,
but think of the potential.

00:25.112 --> 00:28.463
- Oh, my God.
- You get a deal on a fixer-upper.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.292
Oh, my God.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.250
Okay, just imagine,
instead of these

00:33.381 --> 00:36.732
piles of garbage,
rows of sewing machines.

00:36.862 --> 00:37.994
And, through that door

00:38.125 --> 00:40.692
that's rusted shut, sock ovens

00:40.823 --> 00:42.825
baking away, and...

00:42.955 --> 00:46.611
we'd be bringing jobs back
to Detroit and changing lives.

00:46.742 --> 00:49.658
I tried to be a good wife,
but how can I be?

00:49.788 --> 00:52.400
All I do is cook and clean
for a man

00:52.530 --> 00:55.490
who barely looks at me...

00:55.620 --> 00:57.405
let alone touches me.

00:59.189 --> 01:02.279
It is like living
with a stranger.

01:07.110 --> 01:10.157
Ask her if she's
taken any lovers.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.513
Mmm, I do not know
what smells better,

01:18.643 --> 01:20.210
you or the stew.

01:20.341 --> 01:22.778
You always say that.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.954
I am a sucker

01:25.085 --> 01:26.782
for EstÃ©e Lauder and goat meat.

01:26.912 --> 01:28.914
<i>Kaale,</i> Uncle.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.307
<i>Kaale.</i> Hey.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.353
That's your price

01:32.483 --> 01:33.919
for an HVAC installation?

01:34.050 --> 01:35.921
Well, it better be
a hybrid split system

01:36.052 --> 01:37.445
or I'm gonna lose it.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.490
He's been on business calls
the entire drive.

01:39.621 --> 01:40.839
Don't jerk me around.

01:40.970 --> 01:43.015
You're talking
to Bob Wheeler here.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.236
I love when he tells them
who they are talking to.

01:47.672 --> 01:49.109
Is your mother not with you?

01:49.239 --> 01:50.371
Oh, she did not feel like it.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.199
She said she would not be
good company.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.026
That never stopped her before.

01:54.766 --> 01:57.204
I love my sister,
but it will be nice

01:57.334 --> 01:59.510
to serve a meal
- without being judged.
- Mm.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.251
Or being told how tired I look.

02:01.382 --> 02:04.254
I get plenty of rest.
This is my face.

02:05.473 --> 02:06.822
And we won't have to pretend
we're hearing

02:06.952 --> 02:08.911
Granny's stories
for the first time.

02:09.041 --> 02:11.479
That is your grandmother.
Show some respect.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.307
Sorry.

02:13.437 --> 02:16.223
I don't want to brag, but I just
got a multi-zone HVAC system

02:16.353 --> 02:18.138
for the price of a single one.

02:18.268 --> 02:19.530
I lied, I want to brag.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.576
Congratulations,
Bob.

02:21.706 --> 02:22.881
Well done.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.883
Soon, my husband
will be compressing

02:25.014 --> 02:27.016
every foot in America.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.235
There's still plenty to do

02:28.365 --> 02:29.714
before the factory
is up and running.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.412
Next, I got to find somebody
to redo the floors.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.153
I-I know a guy.

02:33.283 --> 02:35.155
He's got a degree
in civil engineering

02:35.285 --> 02:37.679
and a smile
that lights up a room.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.682
Have you done floors?

02:40.812 --> 02:43.380
Have I done floors.
Olu?

02:43.511 --> 02:44.947
He has done floors.

02:45.077 --> 02:46.209
Sell it a little bit.

02:47.341 --> 02:50.082
He has done floors!

02:51.258 --> 02:53.303
Well, now I'm worried you
might be out of my price range.

02:53.434 --> 02:56.437
I am, but I can
give you a discount.

02:56.567 --> 03:00.049
Use promo code
"Your favorite uncle."

03:28.817 --> 03:31.341
Excuse me, is this the famous

03:31.472 --> 03:33.865
MaxDot Manufacturing Company?

03:33.996 --> 03:36.128
It sure is.
I'm Bob Wheeler, CEO.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.913
You the floor guy?

03:38.043 --> 03:40.611
We are pretending
not to know each other.

03:40.742 --> 03:43.353
Hey, thanks again
for doing this.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.225
Listen, I'm gonna be running
around taking care of stuff.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.923
While I'm not here,
<i>mi</i> factory <i>es su</i> factory.

03:48.053 --> 03:51.840
I must say, your excitement
is contagious.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.712
Achoo.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.148
So, uh, what do you think--

03:56.279 --> 03:58.586
should just take
- a few days, right?
- Shh.

03:58.716 --> 04:01.371
Give me a moment.

04:01.502 --> 04:02.285
Just needs a good cleaning,

04:02.416 --> 04:04.200
maybe glaze it with an epoxy.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.376
- Oh, boy.
- What "oh, boy"?

04:06.507 --> 04:09.118
Look.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.816
- That little crack?
- It is little now,

04:11.947 --> 04:14.776
but in 20 to 30 years,
this will be a real problem.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.648
Well, we don't have to worry
about that, I'll be dead.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.999
There is a right and a wrong way
to do this, Bob.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.306
Tunde, I got a whole factory
to get up and running,

04:23.437 --> 04:25.917
and I can't do anything
until these floors are finished.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.093
I understand.

04:28.224 --> 04:30.182
I'll do it the wrong way.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.836
Great. I got to make a call.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.534
Do you have
a preference of color?

04:33.664 --> 04:36.058
- Uh, gray.
- Uh, what about speckles?

04:36.188 --> 04:38.408
- No.
- Okay.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.454
I'm doing speckles.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.289
<i>E karo,</i> Mummy. <i>Karo.</i>

04:49.419 --> 04:51.378
This package came for you.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.510
- Put it over there.
- It's from Daddy.

04:53.641 --> 04:57.384
Yes, put it over there.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.864
It could be perishable.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.737
Not unless your father
threw in a farewell ham.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.304
What does that mean?

05:04.434 --> 05:06.697
Nothing. It is just some clothes

05:06.828 --> 05:08.264
and bits and pieces.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.048
Daddy sent you your things?

05:10.179 --> 05:11.615
I told him to.

05:11.746 --> 05:15.227
They were of no use to me
sitting in Nigeria.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.142
Oh, Esu Aje.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.796
It still has

05:18.927 --> 05:20.755
the chip from when I knocked it
off the mantelpiece.

05:20.885 --> 05:23.018
You told me
that was your brother.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.412
Yes. It was.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.243
Daddy's wedding ring?

05:31.374 --> 05:32.941
Did you ask for that, too?

05:33.071 --> 05:34.769
No.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.946
I would have preferred the ham.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.471
Are you okay, Mummy?

05:41.602 --> 05:43.430
Of course I am.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.649
Do you want to put the statue
on the mantelpiece?

05:45.780 --> 05:47.042
We'll make room for it.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.565
No, thank you.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.698
I would not want to disrupt your

05:50.828 --> 05:53.048
"anything goes"
decorating style.

05:58.575 --> 06:01.230
- What's up?
- Come look at this.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.450
Oh, the UP-2-0-1-6,

06:03.580 --> 06:06.017
stainless steel,
sock-shaping oven.

06:06.148 --> 06:07.758
These are the machines
that will allow us

06:07.889 --> 06:10.021
to bring manufacturing
back to America.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.719
- Where are they made?
- China.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.070
I will have them installed
at the beginning of the week.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.768
Great. Uncle Tunde should be
done glazing the floors by then.

06:17.899 --> 06:21.337
I did not realize the Tunde
you hired was your Uncle Tunde.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.296
You thought I knew two Tundes?

06:24.427 --> 06:25.297
It is a very common name.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.821
Not in Detroit.

06:26.951 --> 06:29.998
Besides, Uncle Tunde's
more than qualified,

06:30.128 --> 06:32.304
and he offered.
What's the problem?

06:32.435 --> 06:34.959
The first job you have to give,
and it goes to a family member.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.918
Wait a minute, you helped
get your cousin get a job.

06:37.048 --> 06:40.138
You are lenient with
your family, whereas Kofo

06:40.269 --> 06:42.619
lives in fear that
I will fire him. Kofo!

06:45.622 --> 06:46.971
Did I do something wrong?

06:47.102 --> 06:47.798
Did you?

06:47.929 --> 06:49.278
I do not think so,

06:49.409 --> 06:51.498
b-but please forgive me.

06:51.628 --> 06:52.499
You see?

06:52.629 --> 06:54.283
That's not...

06:54.414 --> 06:56.720
Christina, come here
- for a minute.
- I'm on a break, Bob.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.901
<i>Okay,</i>

07:04.032 --> 07:05.816
here's the one
we're looking at.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.818
It's the UP-2-0-1-6--

07:07.949 --> 07:10.255
the Ferrari of sock ovens.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.996
- Does it go fast?
- Uh,

07:12.127 --> 07:14.346
it can cook 300 pairs an hour
with an estimated curing time

07:14.477 --> 07:17.045
of three and a half minutes.
That fast enough for you?

07:17.175 --> 07:20.701
I really do not know.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.181
Hey, Tunde.

07:23.312 --> 07:26.097
I am just calling to say
I filled in all the cracks.

07:26.228 --> 07:29.100
What? I told you
not to worry about that.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.276
I wanted to care
as little as you do,

07:31.407 --> 07:33.714
but I could not.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.759
This is gonna set us back
a whole day.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.544
I am as disappointed as you are.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.634
Some friendly advice:
next time you hire a contractor,

07:40.764 --> 07:43.767
be honest about the scope
of the job.

07:43.898 --> 07:46.248
It's a floor, Tunde.

07:46.378 --> 07:49.251
Not yet, but it will be.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.079
Oops, I-I have to go.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.777
I found another crack.

07:53.908 --> 07:56.606
No, Tunde, Tunde. [groans]

07:56.737 --> 07:59.783
I don't know why I thought
it was a good idea to hire him.

07:59.914 --> 08:03.091
Because you are a kind
and generous man.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.135
Thank you.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.355
But, yes, it was
a very bad idea.

08:08.357 --> 08:09.750
- Abishola?
- Y-Yes, Mummy?

08:09.880 --> 08:11.578
Here is the menu
I want for my party.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.231
Her what now?

08:13.362 --> 08:15.756
I suggested we throw a
party to honor my mother.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.975
What a wonderful thing.

08:18.106 --> 08:20.500
Why?

08:20.630 --> 08:22.458
Because I am worthy of honor.

08:22.589 --> 08:25.200
And we never threw her
a proper welcoming party.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.768
Maybe because we didn't know
she was gonna stay.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.727
All my friends from the
church should be there.

08:30.858 --> 08:31.815
Of course.

08:31.946 --> 08:32.816
And you may invite some people

08:32.947 --> 08:33.904
from the hospital.

08:34.035 --> 08:34.949
I'm sure Kemi will come.

08:35.079 --> 08:37.691
The lunch lady? Ugh.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.431
I want important people.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.085
- Okay.
- Bob,

08:41.216 --> 08:43.000
is there anyone
you would like to invite?

08:43.131 --> 08:45.089
I'm actually not sure
that I can make it.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.614
- You are coming.
- Okay.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.572
I very much enjoy your mother.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.488
I will leave it to you if you
want to invite your siblings.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.098
Thank you.

08:54.229 --> 08:55.883
- Mm.
- Thanks for stopping by.

08:56.013 --> 08:59.103
Oh, honey, I got
a bad feeling about this.

08:59.234 --> 09:02.193
Yes, it's going
to be very awful.

09:02.324 --> 09:04.195
But my mother is having
a difficult time

09:04.326 --> 09:06.415
and I want to cheer her up.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.591
We will have to deep clean
this filthy house.

09:08.722 --> 09:11.028
How about I give you $1,000

09:11.159 --> 09:13.683
and you cheer her up
in Atlantic City?

09:19.863 --> 09:22.997
âª She works hard for the money âª

09:23.127 --> 09:25.956
âª So hard for it, honey... âª

09:26.087 --> 09:27.871
I think we can cut
into this wall.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.656
Get some electrical
feed outside.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.396
What is that?

09:31.527 --> 09:32.876
It's Uncle Tunde.
You got to love him.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.577
What are you doing?!

09:45.280 --> 09:47.543
âª She works hard
for the money... âª

09:47.674 --> 09:49.937
What the hell are you doing?!

09:51.678 --> 09:53.680
I'm working hard for the money.

09:53.810 --> 09:56.857
You're destroying
my factory!

09:56.987 --> 09:59.511
I had to find out the condition
of the subfloor.

09:59.642 --> 10:00.861
And?

10:00.991 --> 10:03.472
So far, so good.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.779
Stop! Stop! Stop!

10:07.215 --> 10:08.520
I have to go.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.435
Always a pleasure
to see you, Uncle.

10:10.566 --> 10:11.872
Goodwin.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.482
Get rid of him.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.225
For the love of God!

10:19.270 --> 10:21.446
I am renting this jackhammer
by the hour.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.623
Tick, tock, time is money.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.755
Forget the jackhammer.
Tunde, I love you,

10:25.886 --> 10:27.148
but we got to make
a change here.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.715
What are you saying?

10:28.845 --> 10:29.977
I have to let you go.

10:30.107 --> 10:33.458
But I am Uncle Tunde.

10:33.589 --> 10:36.679
And you always be, but I got to
get this factory going.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.073
And I am in your way.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.336
Right now, yes.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.251
I understand.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.383
Hold this.

10:47.255 --> 10:48.648
Wait, what am I supposed
to do with this thing?

10:48.778 --> 10:52.347
Try chipping away at the ice
around your heart.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.745
Mm.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.443
I do not like the look
of these plantains.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.010
Oh, they are fine.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.315
I'm sure everyone
will love them.

11:04.446 --> 11:05.665
Yeah, Granny,
they're gonna be great.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.188
Why is the boy speaking?

11:07.318 --> 11:09.016
I do not know.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.758
- Excuse me, young man.
- Hello, madam,

11:11.888 --> 11:13.194
what can I do for you?

11:13.324 --> 11:15.413
My daughter is having
a party for me.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.894
Uh, that is nice. Is there
something I can help you with?

11:18.025 --> 11:20.592
No, I just wanted you to know.

11:22.638 --> 11:24.205
What is next?

11:24.335 --> 11:27.077
Uh, rice for the jollof
and meat for the suya.

11:27.208 --> 11:30.385
Okay, you and Dele go get
the rice and I will go

11:30.515 --> 11:31.908
to the meat counter.

11:33.431 --> 11:34.737
This is wonderful.

11:34.868 --> 11:36.652
She's so excited
about the party

11:36.783 --> 11:38.393
she has no time to feel sad.

11:38.523 --> 11:39.786
Sad about what?

11:39.916 --> 11:42.092
None of your business.
Go and get the rice.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.880
Did this goat die of old age?

11:47.010 --> 11:49.534
I am being honored!

11:57.238 --> 11:59.544
Your dad just sent her
all her stuff in a box?

11:59.675 --> 12:01.198
And his wedding ring.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.765
Damn, that's cold.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.549
I think it's very generous.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.466
She can melt the gold down
into a necklace or a tooth.

12:10.294 --> 12:11.469
You okay?

12:11.600 --> 12:12.732
Yeah, why?

12:12.862 --> 12:14.211
You just, you seem stressed.

12:14.342 --> 12:17.432
Oh, I'm fine.
Just sank every dollar I have,

12:17.562 --> 12:20.217
plus I took a loan out
using this house as collateral

12:20.348 --> 12:23.525
to build a manufacturing plant
that has no freaking floors.

12:23.655 --> 12:26.920
Talking about it always helps,
though, right?

12:27.050 --> 12:28.835
Sure, it's a big help.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.055
Hey, uh, question:

12:32.186 --> 12:35.406
are we ever gonna have a party
that's not Nigerian themed?

12:35.537 --> 12:39.323
It's not a theme, Douglas.
They're Nigerian.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.543
- It's a very nice party.
- Thank you.

12:41.673 --> 12:45.068
Everything's great,
except for the plantains.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.766
Auntie, Uncle.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.898
- Bob.
- Hm.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.031
I wasn't sure you would come.

12:51.161 --> 12:54.164
We would never spit
in the face of family,

12:54.295 --> 12:55.687
unlike some people.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.168
She is referring to you.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.040
I got that. Thanks.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.606
What's going on?

13:01.737 --> 13:04.566
My husband kindly
offered his services

13:04.696 --> 13:06.611
and your son threw him out.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.309
You can't throw him out,

13:08.439 --> 13:10.137
he's Uncle Tunde.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.312
That's what I said.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.792
I'm not the bad guy.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.489
He was tearing up my floor.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.186
What are they talking about?

13:16.317 --> 13:17.535
Bob fired Tunde.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.711
- Bob, how could you?
- That's messed-up,

13:19.842 --> 13:21.191
- man.
- Bob,

13:21.322 --> 13:22.714
do we have to discuss this now?

13:22.845 --> 13:24.499
I don't want
to discuss it at all.

13:24.629 --> 13:27.719
I was recently let go
from a job I loved.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.460
I know how much it hurts.

13:29.591 --> 13:30.766
Does it get better?

13:30.897 --> 13:32.768
I'll let you know.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.423
All right, that's enough.

13:35.553 --> 13:36.554
I was doing something nice
for the guy.

13:36.685 --> 13:37.947
So, it was charity?!

13:38.078 --> 13:39.775
Stop digging, Sock Man.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.211
I'll tell you what
the problem is.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.823
- Bob hates old people.
- What?

13:43.953 --> 13:45.912
You're always talking
to me about moving out.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.175
So, there's a pattern
of elder abuse.

13:48.305 --> 13:49.654
There's no pattern!

13:49.785 --> 13:50.917
Bob, you are shouting.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.223
Please, wait to scream at Tunde

13:53.354 --> 13:56.270
until people are done
paying tribute to me.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.271
Let's go.

13:57.401 --> 13:58.446
Aw, come on, guys.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.187
Enjoy your evening, Ebun.

14:00.317 --> 14:03.625
One day, he will
turn on you, too.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.106
Please don't leave.

14:07.542 --> 14:10.675
All this excitement has made up
for the terrible plantains.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.465
Sorry I ruined the party.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.641
Ugh, you were just
trying to help Uncle.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.295
Might've been nice
if you mentioned that

14:21.425 --> 14:23.297
while I was back there
taking grenades.

14:23.427 --> 14:26.082
There's no point in the both
of us getting blown up.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.911
Give him time, I'm sure
he will forgive you.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.173
You don't believe that.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.132
No.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.438
Mama Ebun,

14:34.569 --> 14:35.918
I want you to know
that everything

14:36.049 --> 14:38.529
that happened tonight
- was my fault.
- Eh,

14:38.660 --> 14:40.053
Tunde was being a baby.

14:40.183 --> 14:42.185
Okay, was everybody on my side?

14:42.316 --> 14:45.145
These men insist on being
honored and respected,

14:45.275 --> 14:46.798
even when they
do not deserve it.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.931
Where was this an hour ago?

14:49.062 --> 14:50.324
Whether they are right or wrong,

14:50.454 --> 14:51.891
all they care about
is their pride.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.675
They can neglect you
for years and then have

14:53.805 --> 14:56.721
the gall to be offended
when you ask for your things.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.376
Are we still talking
about Tunde?

14:59.507 --> 15:01.248
Mummy, are you okay?

15:01.378 --> 15:02.989
I am fine.

15:03.119 --> 15:06.383
In fact, I am better
than I have been in a long time.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.255
I'm happy to hear that.

15:08.385 --> 15:09.865
This is my home now,
and it will be

15:09.996 --> 15:11.954
for as long as I live.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.564
Good night.

15:16.306 --> 15:17.699
As long as she lives, huh?

15:17.829 --> 15:19.048
Yes.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.703
She seems pretty healthy.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.314
Yes.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.577
Yeah.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.585
- How is that?
- Perfect.

15:34.716 --> 15:37.066
You are the best picture hanger
in the whole world.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.634
I know what
you are doing, Olu,

15:39.764 --> 15:42.071
and it is working.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.379
Hi, Auntie.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.165
Can I talk to Tunde?

15:49.296 --> 15:50.601
He is not here.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.168
Fine, I'll wait outside

15:52.299 --> 15:53.865
till he goes on his
10:00 a.m. walk.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.259
He knows me so well.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.570
Hi, Uncle Tunde.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.050
Bob.

16:05.921 --> 16:08.489
I'm sorry for disrespecting you.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.014
Did you hear me?

16:12.145 --> 16:13.711
Yes.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.541
I'm starting
to cramp here, Tunde.

16:17.672 --> 16:18.847
You may stand.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.460
Look, I know
I screwed this up.

16:23.591 --> 16:25.854
What was your first clue?

16:27.899 --> 16:31.164
I think the problem was
I was underutilizing you.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.817
Really?

16:32.948 --> 16:35.907
Because I felt very used.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.128
You're absolutely right.
You're Tom Brady,

16:39.259 --> 16:40.695
and I made you
the water boy.

16:40.825 --> 16:43.785
I don't care
what position I play.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.396
I just want to be
on Team Bob.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.398
I want that, too.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.531
All right,

16:50.661 --> 16:52.924
- I'll come and finish the floors.
- No, no.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.622
God, no.

16:54.752 --> 16:57.625
I was thinking
less "hands on,"

16:57.755 --> 16:59.322
more "big picture" role.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.716
We are listening.

17:05.154 --> 17:07.939
"Babatunde Olatunji--

17:08.070 --> 17:10.246
MaxDot Senior Consultant."

17:10.377 --> 17:11.900
What do you say?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.685
I know what you are doing, Bob,

17:14.816 --> 17:16.818
and it is working.

17:23.955 --> 17:27.394
The electrician said all of
this needs to be updated.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.265
Well, we want to make sure
we are to code.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.919
I'll get somebody
on it next week.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.703
They just say that to try

17:32.834 --> 17:36.185
to get more money out of you.
Uh, let me take a look.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.580
Tunde, we-we don't need you
to do that.

17:39.710 --> 17:43.279
I am the senior consultant.
Let me consult.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.326
Mr. Olatunji, please... Oh!

17:47.762 --> 17:49.024
I've decided that

17:49.155 --> 17:51.157
all this needs to be updated.
