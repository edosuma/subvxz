02:21.642 --> 02:23.485
We are here.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.235
<i>At 8,000 feet.
This is it, boys.</i>

02:38.408 --> 02:39.808
<i>You got it, Zamp?</i>

02:40.410 --> 02:41.411
Roger.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.918
You hit this one,
drinks are on me.

02:44.414 --> 02:47.008
I ain't going
to a bar with you, handsome.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.133
You confuse all the broads.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.848
Get your cameras, boys.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.676
I'm gonna light it up
like Christmas.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.640
<i>Pilot to bombardier,
your ship.</i>

03:01.973 --> 03:04.442
Bombardier to pilot.
Roger.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.199
Bombardier to crew,
bomb bay doors open.

03:13.402 --> 03:14.494
Bay doors open!

03:23.286 --> 03:25.129
Damn flak.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.923
Argh!

03:33.130 --> 03:34.302
Oh, boy!

03:44.474 --> 03:45.896
Come on.

03:50.939 --> 03:51.986
Come on, Zamp.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.112
There you are.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.667
Bombs away.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.086
Bombardier to pilot,
your ship.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.458
Roger.

04:06.830 --> 04:07.877
Okay.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.085
Here we go.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.851
Yeah, just like Christmas.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.609
Bomb bay doors
are stuck.

04:35.692 --> 04:36.693
Uh-oh.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.283
- Zero, inbound, 10 o'clock, level.
- All right.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.540
<i>Here they come, boys.
Call them out.</i>

04:52.042 --> 04:54.511
<i>Gotta get those
doors closed, Zamp.</i>

04:54.586 --> 04:55.678
Roger.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.552
Get them, get them,
get them, Mitchell.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.135
<i>Coming in high
at nine o'clock.</i>

05:04.596 --> 05:05.836
Coming level to three.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.936
Take 'em out, Mitchell.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.789
Low, he's going low.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.841
Brooks,
he's going down.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.422
He's coming to your side.

05:44.886 --> 05:45.933
Glassman!

05:46.012 --> 05:47.309
Glassman!

06:12.038 --> 06:13.039
Okay, okay.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.593
I know, I know. I know.
Let me take a look at you.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.213
I know, buddy, I know.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.640
Just be brave now,
all right?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.389
You're still good looking.
You're still very handsome.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.469
You make me sick!

06:34.519 --> 06:35.645
Yeah!

06:36.646 --> 06:38.023
I know.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.947
You got it, buddy.
You got it.
I'm right here.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.386
I want to go home.
You will, Harry.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.163
You will. All right?
You think about home.
Okay?

06:58.835 --> 06:59.836
Oh, boy.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.300
Louie?

07:06.968 --> 07:08.470
Lambert.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.602
Here, take this.
All right? Take this.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.317
It's okay.
Take this.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.401
Pillsbury?

07:48.969 --> 07:50.892
<i>Nice work, boys.</i>

07:56.726 --> 07:58.228
Everything's shot up
back there, Phil.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.947
We got no hydraulics
but we're still flying.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.992
We got no flaps, Phil.
So basically we got no brakes.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.364
How far to base?

08:05.777 --> 08:06.994
I don't know.
Five hours.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.788
If we make it that far.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.741
The runway is
over 6,000 feet,

08:10.824 --> 08:11.950
but we're gonna
need at least 10

08:12.033 --> 08:13.330
if we got no brakes.

08:23.586 --> 08:27.011
<i>God created
two great lights.</i>

08:27.924 --> 08:30.427
<i>The greater light
to rule over the day,</i>

08:31.177 --> 08:32.599
<i>and the lesser light</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:34.602
to rule over the night.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.227
Now these things,

08:36.640 --> 08:39.895
light and dark,
day and night,

08:41.604 --> 08:43.277
are separated
from each other.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.113
God created each
in its place.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.698
He did not create
a battle between them.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.624
He said, "I have created
both of these things."

08:55.618 --> 08:58.872
You must live
through the night.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.716
Don't battle with it.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.681
For God said,
"The night also is mine."

09:07.756 --> 09:11.386
He sent his son, Jesus,
not to do battle.

09:12.844 --> 09:16.064
Not to wage war
on the sins of man,

09:16.931 --> 09:18.604
but to forgive them.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.819
Forgive the sin.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.154
Smile on the sinner.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.566
Accept the darkness.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.072
Live through the night.

09:30.153 --> 09:33.453
Love thine enemy.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.497
Zamperini!

09:46.294 --> 09:47.466
Hey!

10:25.250 --> 10:26.718
Is that
garlic I smell?

10:27.210 --> 10:28.883
What are you doing, wop?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.509
Hey, why don't
you go back to Italy?

10:30.588 --> 10:32.386
You and your greasy
wop family.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.935
- Get him up.
- Get up.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.686
Hey! Hey!

10:37.762 --> 10:39.184
Get off him!

10:48.106 --> 10:50.905
Stay down.
Dumb dago.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.825
Hey! Hey!
Get him off me!

10:57.907 --> 10:59.124
<i>Jesus.</i>

10:59.200 --> 11:00.292
Hey!

11:00.368 --> 11:01.995
- Shit.
- Go, go, go.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.507
Only reason you're not
in reform school now

11:10.587 --> 11:13.386
is because of the respect
we have for your parents.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.683
Everybody in town
wants you put away.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.193
Sorry, Louise.
He was fighting again.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.443
And, uh, we found this.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.453
He painted the bottle.
It's liquor.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.155
What do you think?
He's kinda cute, right?

13:47.702 --> 13:50.546
Come on, Jimmy,
pick it up! Go, go, go!

13:50.621 --> 13:51.668
Come on, Pete!

13:51.748 --> 13:53.045
Go! Go! Go!

13:53.124 --> 13:54.592
Come on, pass him!

13:55.585 --> 13:57.132
Is someone down there?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.092
Who's down there?

14:17.023 --> 14:18.115
<i>This is so dumb.</i>

14:18.691 --> 14:20.614
Since when were
you so smart?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.445
Come on.
Faster.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.576
Why? No one's
chasing me.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.202
I'm chasing you.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.875
I can't do this, Pete.
I'm not like you.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.337
I'm nothing.
Just let me be nothing.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.967
What are you talking about?

14:41.422 --> 14:42.969
I can't make a track team.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.185
I don't even know
why you want me to.
Yes, you can.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.353
If you can take it,
you can make it.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.097
What?

14:50.014 --> 14:51.937
If you can take it,
you can make it.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.064
All right.
You train and you fight

14:54.143 --> 14:55.645
way harder than
those other guys.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.364
And you win.
You get out from under them.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.407
Or you keep going
the way you're going

15:00.483 --> 15:02.326
and you end up as
a bum in the streets.

15:04.362 --> 15:08.037
You can do this, Lou.
Just gotta believe you can.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.870
I don't believe.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.964
I do.

15:18.876 --> 15:19.968
Come on.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.367
Come on!

15:52.201 --> 15:53.703
You dumb dago!

17:13.574 --> 17:14.826
Come on, Louie!

17:18.954 --> 17:21.458
<i>Boy, oh, boy,
can that guy fly.</i>

17:21.915 --> 17:24.294
<i>They're calling him
the Torrance Tornado.</i>

17:42.562 --> 17:45.566
<i>This kid Zamperini runs like his
feet never touch the ground.</i>

18:04.292 --> 18:05.965
Come on!
Keep going!

18:22.435 --> 18:23.607
Come on, Louie!

18:25.980 --> 18:28.324
Come on, Louie!
Come on, Louie!

18:30.192 --> 18:31.318
Come on, come on,
come on!

18:35.948 --> 18:37.825
The Torrance Tornado
smoked the mile

18:37.908 --> 18:39.956
<i>in 4 minutes, 21.3 seconds.</i>

18:40.036 --> 18:42.209
<i>Zamperini is now
officially the fastest</i>

18:42.330 --> 18:44.128
<i>high school runner
in American history.</i>

18:44.206 --> 18:47.050
<i>Folks, this kid is on
his way to the Olympics!</i>

18:48.669 --> 18:50.546
Why would I come?
You're not going to win.

18:51.047 --> 18:53.550
Sure. I know that.
It's all right.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.595
Four years' time, next Olympics,
that's when I show them.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.725
This is just
the tryouts for me.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.390
Tokyo.
Tokyo.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.739
Smart kid.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.071
Take care of yourself, all right?
Mmm-hmm.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.036
Go have a little
fun, too, huh?

19:14.654 --> 19:16.247
Say hi to those pretty
German broads for me.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.494
You know it.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.584
Come here.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.584
Thanks, Pete.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.298
For everything.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.641
Go on.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.648
Louie.

19:48.646 --> 19:53.072
A moment of pain is worth
a lifetime of glory.

19:54.402 --> 19:55.949
You remember that.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.552
Gear is down.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.682
All right, here we go.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.151
Still coming in
pretty hot. 110.

20:33.983 --> 20:34.984
Almost.

20:36.527 --> 20:37.574
Still too fast.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.371
Come on.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.183
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.582
Okay.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.296
Flat tire.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.523
Thank you, God.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.605
Now you're praying?

22:34.520 --> 22:36.067
I was busy before.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.287
My mother does
that sometimes.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.369
Yeah. A lot of
people do this.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.455
He say anything back?

22:53.455 --> 22:55.628
Yeah.
What?

22:57.334 --> 22:59.257
He <i>says</i> my bombardier
is a dope.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.141
Really?

23:10.931 --> 23:12.023
All right, buddy.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.653
Now!

23:31.827 --> 23:33.079
Come on, Louie!

23:41.378 --> 23:42.846
Keep on, buddy.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.054
Keep pushing.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.769
Whoa!

23:52.848 --> 23:53.940
Yeah?

23:55.017 --> 23:56.234
Huh?

23:58.687 --> 23:59.984
Oh, boy!

24:00.064 --> 24:02.362
4:12.
Getting close.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.069
I hope you're not
that fast in the sack.

24:08.656 --> 24:09.908
Oh, boy.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.381
Wrap it up, Speedy.
Huh?

24:18.457 --> 24:19.834
We got a mission.
Huh?

24:19.917 --> 24:21.919
Not a combat mission.
Rescue.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.259
<i>B-24 en route to
Kenton never made it...</i>

24:24.338 --> 24:26.682
so looks like
those boys ditched.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.892
A lot of ocean.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.470
Yeah.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.055
And, uh, they got
us some new crew.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.392
We get a new plane?

24:49.989 --> 24:53.084
This is just like
sitting in a living room
trying to fly the house.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.119
They've been taking parts
off this for other planes.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.500
We're lucky it's
still got an engine.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.957
Lieutenant says
it's airworthy.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.758
It's been certified, he says.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.754
By Helen Keller.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.270
Lot of ocean.

25:18.392 --> 25:20.986
Yeah. Lot of ocean.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.696
Mitchell.
Yeah.

25:26.775 --> 25:27.947
You're up.

25:38.203 --> 25:41.332
So a duck walks
into a bar, right?

25:42.791 --> 25:44.589
Or, waddles, if you will.

25:44.835 --> 25:47.054
So, he walks
into the bar...
Uh-huh.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.881
He says to the bartender,

25:48.964 --> 25:51.058
"Can I have
a crème de menthe?"

25:56.972 --> 25:58.394
Hang on, there.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.226
Number one is out.

26:00.309 --> 26:01.356
Other engines are
burning more fuel.

26:01.435 --> 26:02.482
Gotta feather it.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.147
Hey, uh...

26:05.272 --> 26:07.115
What's his name?
I don't know.

26:07.191 --> 26:08.238
Engineer?

26:08.317 --> 26:10.437
Can you come up to the cockpit
and feather the engine?

26:11.361 --> 26:13.989
What's going on, guys?
Co-pilot to radio.
Send to base.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.075
- Which one?
- The left.

26:16.158 --> 26:17.250
We need more on the right.

26:17.326 --> 26:18.526
That's all we
got on the right.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.582
We need more on the right!

26:19.661 --> 26:20.861
That's all we got
on the right.

26:23.499 --> 26:24.500
Damn it!

26:24.583 --> 26:26.585
Left engines
are both gone.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.338
That's everything
on the right, Phil.

26:29.505 --> 26:30.506
Okay.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.346
Hey, Phil?

26:37.513 --> 26:38.514
Yeah?

26:38.889 --> 26:40.106
Is this a...

26:41.183 --> 26:42.355
Prepare to crash.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.487
Waist gunner!

26:45.562 --> 26:46.859
Get the rations box.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.237
Tie the guns down.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.360
Who's on the raft?

26:51.443 --> 26:52.535
Glassman!

26:53.445 --> 26:54.492
Send Mayday.

26:54.571 --> 26:55.788
<i>Is everyone in position?</i>

26:55.864 --> 26:57.866
Anyone on the rafts?
Yeah.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.042
I got it!

26:59.576 --> 27:01.169
Mayday,
Mayday, Mayday!

27:01.245 --> 27:03.373
This is <i>Green Hornet.</i>
We are going down.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.957
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday!

27:05.040 --> 27:06.041
Okay.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.925
Everybody brace.

27:10.754 --> 27:11.755
Brace!

28:17.863 --> 28:19.365
<i>In an astounding performance,</i>

28:19.448 --> 28:22.042
<i>Negro American Jesse Owens
from Ohio State</i>

28:22.117 --> 28:25.291
<i>has won four gold medals in
the 100 meter, the 200 meter</i>

28:25.370 --> 28:27.998
<i>the long jump and
the 400 meter relay.</i>

28:28.498 --> 28:30.375
<i>Next up, the 5,000 meter</i>

28:30.459 --> 28:33.884
<i>with America's
record-breaking Don Lash
leading the American team.</i>

28:34.046 --> 28:36.469
<i>Along with newcomer
Louie Zamperini.</i>

28:50.270 --> 28:51.271
<i>Fertig!</i>

29:11.375 --> 29:13.548
<i>And already,
three sections of
runners have formed</i>

29:13.627 --> 29:17.803
<i>with America's Don Lash
and the Finnish Salminen and
Höckert ahead of the pack.</i>

29:17.881 --> 29:21.135
<i>The Finns always the favorite
in this long-haul event.</i>

29:24.388 --> 29:27.642
<i>In the second group
is America's Louie Zamperini.</i>

29:34.481 --> 29:37.234
<i>The Finns, Höckert,
Lehtinen and Salminen
have set the pace</i>

29:37.317 --> 29:39.445
<i>and they are not letting up.</i>

29:40.070 --> 29:42.949
<i>And Zamperini is fading,
too, dropping further back.</i>

30:02.467 --> 30:03.719
<i>And into the 8th lap</i>

30:03.802 --> 30:07.102
<i>it's the Finns
still in the lead,
with Salminen in first place.</i>

30:07.639 --> 30:09.061
Come on, Louie.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.232
<i>Come on, Louie.</i>

30:22.612 --> 30:24.159
<i>And we start the last lap.</i>

30:24.239 --> 30:25.866
<i>The Finns seem
to be in control.</i>

30:25.949 --> 30:29.920
<i>It doesn't look like
Don Lash is gonna bring home
the medal for the USA.</i>

30:34.333 --> 30:37.758
<i>There seems to be some
movement back in the pack.</i>

30:38.754 --> 30:42.759
<i>Yes, that's Zamperini overtaking
Norway's Rolf Hansen.</i>

30:47.262 --> 30:49.435
<i>He seems to have
some gas in reserve.</i>

30:49.514 --> 30:51.482
<i>He really is
making up some time.</i>

30:55.771 --> 30:57.865
<i>Höckert and Lehtinen
will be one and two.</i>

30:57.939 --> 31:00.067
<i>But look at that Zamperini!</i>

31:00.150 --> 31:02.448
<i>He's got Don Lash
in his sights.</i>

31:04.988 --> 31:08.242
<i>The great Don Lash
is not gonna be
the first American, folks.</i>

31:08.325 --> 31:10.373
<i>H's high school
kid Zamperini</i>

31:10.452 --> 31:12.875
<i>pushing past the
record-breakers on this field!</i>

31:14.122 --> 31:17.717
<i>I have not seen that!
I have not seen that!</i>

31:22.964 --> 31:27.060
<i>That final lap, folks,
the record for that
was 69.2 seconds.</i>

31:27.135 --> 31:29.979
<i>Zamperini just did
it in 56 seconds.</i>

31:30.055 --> 31:33.559
<i>That record is going
to hold for a while,
let me tell you.</i>

33:51.780 --> 33:54.124
All right, Phil.
Okay, buddy.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.046
On three.
Two. Three.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.797
Okay.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.168
All right,
here we go.

34:55.385 --> 34:57.183
Glassman didn't make it.

35:01.224 --> 35:02.271
Cup didn't make it.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.444
Don't think about it, Mac.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.283
We're gonna die.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.202
No, we're not, Mac.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.957
They don't know
where we are.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.368
They'll find us.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.417
They'll never see us.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.378
Tell him to shut up.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.261
Shut up, Mac.
We're gonna die out here.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.054
Come on, Mac, shut up.

35:44.351 --> 35:46.228
Hey, Mac, chocolate.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.565
One square at night,
one square in the morning.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.072
All right?

35:57.405 --> 35:58.577
Mac?

36:00.033 --> 36:02.661
Two or three sips
a day, yeah?

36:03.662 --> 36:05.505
We gotta make it last.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.931
Zamp?

36:15.757 --> 36:17.509
Zamp?
Yeah, yeah?

36:19.427 --> 36:21.145
Yeah, Phil?

36:24.516 --> 36:26.143
I'm glad it's you.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.780
Yeah, I'm glad
it's me, too.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.643
What was that?

37:44.971 --> 37:46.268
Mac! Mac! Mac, come on!

37:46.347 --> 37:48.145
Get the dye, Mac.
Get the dye.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.483
Hey!
Hey!

37:54.689 --> 37:55.861
Hey!

37:58.443 --> 38:00.195
- Hey!
- Hey!

38:01.154 --> 38:02.781
Down here!

38:02.864 --> 38:03.990
Hey!

38:04.073 --> 38:05.199
Turn around!

38:10.747 --> 38:12.340
You son of a bitch!

38:12.916 --> 38:14.293
Turn around!

38:50.829 --> 38:51.909
What did
you do, Mac?

38:54.082 --> 38:55.083
Huh?

38:56.876 --> 38:58.878
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter?

38:58.962 --> 39:00.430
It doesn't matter?

39:08.179 --> 39:09.852
It doesn't matter.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.482
Jesus!

40:42.815 --> 40:44.192
Get it, Mac!
Get it.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.260
I don't think
I can do it.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.681
We gotta try.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.062
We had to try.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.362
You know what?

41:26.359 --> 41:28.361
Maybe the fish
won't be so picky.

41:43.584 --> 41:45.257
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah?

41:45.336 --> 41:46.929
I got one. Yeah.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.723
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

41:49.799 --> 41:51.346
Attaboy, Phil!

41:54.429 --> 41:55.601
Here, here, here.

41:56.806 --> 41:58.103
Damn it.

42:03.271 --> 42:04.272
Okay.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.198
Come here, Mac.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.497
Come on.

42:17.326 --> 42:18.452
Okay.

42:20.788 --> 42:21.914
<i>Buon appetito.</i>

42:30.465 --> 42:31.466
Mmm.

42:32.508 --> 42:33.555
Good?

42:40.391 --> 42:42.735
This is how
the Japanese eat fish.

42:42.810 --> 42:43.857
Raw.

42:43.936 --> 42:46.860
If you ask me, it's not
food until you cook it.

42:48.191 --> 42:49.488
Little lemon,

42:50.526 --> 42:51.778
little garlic...

42:53.321 --> 42:54.914
When we get home,
come around my house.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.707
Mama will cook for ya.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.535
You remember that story
in <i>LIFE</i> magazine

43:00.036 --> 43:01.663
about Eddie Rickenbacker?

43:03.623 --> 43:06.627
Him and his crew ran out
of fuel over the Pacific.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.758
They were drifting
in rafts for 24 days.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.182
Twenty-four days.

43:13.925 --> 43:15.427
They made it, right?

43:15.676 --> 43:16.677
Yeah.

43:17.970 --> 43:19.847
Most of them
lost their minds.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.395
But they made it.

43:25.353 --> 43:26.696
We gotta keep talking.

43:27.522 --> 43:29.490
Gotta keep our minds sharp.

43:30.691 --> 43:33.410
Hey, I'll tell you what
else you're gonna love.

43:33.486 --> 43:35.238
Mama's gnocchi.

43:35.655 --> 43:37.999
- Italians.
- Nobody...

43:39.117 --> 43:41.461
Nobody a-make-a
gnocchi like her.

43:45.331 --> 43:46.503
So light.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.676
Like clouds.

43:50.837 --> 43:55.388
First, she makes the dough
out of very fine flour.

43:56.384 --> 43:58.728
So fine,
it's like talcum powder.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.606
Then she uses lots of
eggs, like, maybe 12.

44:10.273 --> 44:12.150
And then she
beats them up, Mac.

44:15.361 --> 44:16.988
Beats them up.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.788
And she drizzles them over.

44:23.786 --> 44:24.787
Mmm.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.744
<i>Thou me on</i>

45:05.161 --> 45:08.711
<i>The night is dark</i>

45:09.457 --> 45:13.132
<i>And I am far from home</i>

45:15.963 --> 45:19.092
<i>Lead Thou me on</i>

45:34.649 --> 45:37.619
Do you think
God made the stars, Phil?

45:41.530 --> 45:43.328
Yes, I do.

45:45.368 --> 45:48.463
So you think there's
some kind of a grand plan?

45:49.372 --> 45:51.670
Why did we live
and the others didn't?

45:55.002 --> 45:56.970
Why are we here now?

45:58.339 --> 46:00.182
Here's the plan.

46:01.968 --> 46:04.562
You go on living
the best you can.

46:07.014 --> 46:10.018
You try to have some
fun along the way.

46:13.938 --> 46:16.066
Then one day it's over.

46:17.275 --> 46:18.492
You'll wake up

46:19.235 --> 46:24.036
and there's an angel sitting
at the edge of your bed.

46:25.574 --> 46:27.042
Angel says,

46:29.453 --> 46:30.705
"Okay,

46:32.498 --> 46:36.344
"you can ask me all those
dumb questions now

46:39.213 --> 46:41.762
"because I got
all the answers."

46:43.592 --> 46:45.390
That's what you believe?

46:47.471 --> 46:48.893
Yeah.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.980
That's what I believe.

47:16.417 --> 47:20.593
Our Father, which art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

47:22.340 --> 47:26.095
If you get me through this,
if you answer my prayers

47:28.220 --> 47:31.599
I swear I'll dedicate
my whole life to you.

47:35.978 --> 47:37.571
I'll do whatever you want.

47:43.402 --> 47:44.904
Please.

48:58.436 --> 48:59.813
Mac.

49:19.081 --> 49:20.333
Here we go.

49:20.416 --> 49:22.616
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go.
All right, all right.

49:24.211 --> 49:25.633
You got it?

49:41.687 --> 49:43.155
Jeez.

50:02.082 --> 50:03.504
Just a scratch.

50:13.844 --> 50:14.891
How is it?

50:14.970 --> 50:15.971
Stinks.

50:17.056 --> 50:18.478
That's the bandage,

50:19.391 --> 50:20.608
not you.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.448
We beat
Rickenbacker's record

50:27.525 --> 50:28.822
four days ago.

50:31.195 --> 50:32.788
You're keeping count?

50:34.782 --> 50:35.783
Yeah.

51:04.770 --> 51:06.818
Hey. Hey.

51:14.989 --> 51:16.332
Hey.

51:51.859 --> 51:52.860
Hey!

51:56.155 --> 51:57.407
Oh, God.

51:58.198 --> 51:59.745
Oh, my God.

52:00.576 --> 52:02.123
Hey!

52:06.749 --> 52:08.296
Hey!

52:58.884 --> 53:01.012
- Get out, boys. Get out!
- I can't!

53:01.095 --> 53:02.597
Come on!

53:52.229 --> 53:54.231
- Mac?
- Still here.

53:54.314 --> 53:55.406
Still here.

53:55.482 --> 53:56.699
Phil?

53:57.151 --> 53:58.619
If the Japs
are this bad,

53:58.694 --> 54:00.742
we might even
win this damn war.

54:20.591 --> 54:22.264
Shit.

54:27.723 --> 54:28.895
Phil.

54:31.560 --> 54:32.903
Here.

55:23.821 --> 55:24.822
Mac.

55:36.041 --> 55:38.885
Did you see that
surprise Mac attack?

55:43.423 --> 55:47.428
Came down on that thing
like a goddamn dive bomber.

55:49.429 --> 55:51.523
Damn sharks
were scared shit.

55:53.767 --> 55:55.769
He saved your skinny ass.

56:07.322 --> 56:11.577
1937. Baseball MVP.

56:16.623 --> 56:18.466
Kid from Detroit.

56:20.294 --> 56:21.841
Gehringer.

56:27.009 --> 56:29.011
Hey, Mac,
get in the game.

56:36.518 --> 56:37.815
Mac?

56:40.981 --> 56:43.075
Mac?
Still here.

56:44.318 --> 56:45.911
Still here.

56:49.072 --> 56:52.076
What are you gonna make
for breakfast, Zamp?

56:54.828 --> 56:56.501
It's your call.

57:01.335 --> 57:03.087
Your mother's gnocchi.

57:04.171 --> 57:06.265
Gnocchi
for breakfast?

57:08.926 --> 57:09.927
Why not?

57:19.937 --> 57:22.360
Am I gonna die?

57:33.367 --> 57:34.994
Maybe, Mac.

57:39.831 --> 57:41.799
You think tonight?

57:48.340 --> 57:49.842
Maybe.

57:52.844 --> 57:54.266
Yes, sir.

57:58.725 --> 58:00.523
I think tonight.

58:09.069 --> 58:11.492
So you got your dough...

58:12.406 --> 58:14.534
And you roll it out.

58:16.702 --> 58:18.420
Just rolling it out.

58:20.455 --> 58:22.207
Good, no lumps.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:02.857
Phil?

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:05.067
Hmm?

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.822
I got good news...

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:14.202
And bad news.

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:38.059
Phil?

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:42.518
Zamp?

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:45.400
You okay?

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.313
Land feels funny.

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:55.155
Funny.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.199
Yeah.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.280
Stop!

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:36.114
Stop it.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.492
Please, stop it.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:55.648
Colonel would like to know
disposition of troops in Hawaii.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.191
I don't know.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:00.160
Speak up!

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:04.035
I wouldn't know.

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.205
I haven't been there in...

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:18.991
Is this you?

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:29.389
You are famous
Olympic athlete.

01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:37.735
Colonel would like to know location
of radar in E-class, B-24.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.908
We used the
old one. D-class.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.244
You bombardier?
Yes.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:49.118
What happened to the
Marines from Makin Island?

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:55.840
How you work
the Norden bombsight?

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:57.041
You just twist
two knobs.

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:59.253
What happened
to the Marines?

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:06.259
Draw Norden bombsight.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:22.985
They were beheaded.

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:32.436
Fuck!

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.497
Take off clothes.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.293
Kneel down.

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:23.081
Kneel down?

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:25.379
Kneel down!

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:18.578
No, no! No, no!

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:19.702
Phil?

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.868
Phil?
Zamp!

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:24.827
Zamp!
Phil?

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:26.662
Zamp!

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:57.782
This is Tokyo, right?

01:09:57.944 --> 01:09:59.867
Must be.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:04.041
I was supposed to race
here for the Olympics...

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:06.085
Before they got canceled.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:07.416
Yeah?

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:10.881
I always wanted
to come to Tokyo.

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:15.383
Careful what
you wish for, fella.

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:10.854
Soldier. Soldier.

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:12.648
Officer.

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:15.480
Soldier.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:17.694
Officer.

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:08.409
Good evening,
old prisoners.

01:12:09.617 --> 01:12:12.541
Welcome, new hands.

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:17.880
This is Omori Detention Camp.

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:24.136
I am Corporal Watanabe.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:34.105
You are enemies of Japan.

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:40.399
You will be treated
accordingly.

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:19.478
Look at me.

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:25.701
Look me in the eye.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:04.778
Look at me!

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:21.545
Don't look at me.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.253
Don't look at me.

01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:40.352
New prisoners,
you are not dismissed.

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:43.813
You will stand a quarantine.

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:49.073
We cannot have disease
in the barracks.

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.360
Evening, chaps.
Evening, sir.

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:33.538
Tom Miller,
your barrack commander.

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:35.492
Let's get you settled
into your bunks, shall we?

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:41.496
You're up top.

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:45.921
305,

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:50.671
You're here next
to sleeping beauty.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:52.802
Take a pew.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.927
307, you're in here.

01:15:58.054 --> 01:15:59.271
You are?

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:00.897
Frank Tinker.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:02.646
Tinker, you're up top.

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:08.196
I see you met the Bird.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.038
Why do you call him
"the Bird"?

01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:17.239
Because he listens.

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:21.578
And if he heard the names we'd
like to call him, he'd kill us.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:23.955
Apparently
he grew up wealthy.

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:26.257
Wanted to be an officer.
Expected to be, too.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:28.838
And was denied,

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:31.512
which obviously
hasn't gone down too well.

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:35.433
Of course, none of this
explains his erratic behavior.

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:40.388
Commander Fitzgerald.

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:42.189
Zamperini, sir.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.823
They were looking
for answers.

01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:53.071
Didn't get any
though, did they?

01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:54.697
Not one bit.

01:16:58.322 --> 01:16:59.574
You should get
some shut-eye.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:01.913
Yes, sir.

01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:36.326
Infirmary,
turning right!

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:37.949
Dismissed!

01:17:38.946 --> 01:17:42.416
Officers, turning right!

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:44.497
Dismissed!

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:20.617
There is much talent
in Omori camp.

01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:24.955
We have an opera singer.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.037
Who is the opera singer?

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:39.808
We have a chef
from Sydney, Australia.

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:45.980
And we have
an Olympic athlete.

01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:51.314
Who is the Olympic athlete?

01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:59.577
Who is the Olympic athlete?

01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:41.694
Don't get up.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:24.904
You fail.

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:29.371
You are nothing.

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:15.375
Sir?

01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:21.711
He's tracing so we can return
it before the Japs find out.

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:24.047
He's got most of
the war mapped out.

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:30.886
We've invaded
the Marshall Islands.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:38.227
The US have invaded
the Marshall Islands.

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:40.233
Allies are gaining ground.

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.173
You know, I gotta say...

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:43.834
Please don't.
For a bunch of guys
who don't eat anything

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.134
we sure do shit a lot.

01:22:47.754 --> 01:22:49.097
Oh, yeah.

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.262
I think that one is mine.

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:12.889
You like Saipan?

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:42.669
I'm gonna kill him.

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:46.123
Then they shoot you.

01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:48.425
I don't give a damn.
Let them shoot me.

01:24:50.877 --> 01:24:53.005
That's not how we beat them.

01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:56.801
We beat them by making it to
the end of the war alive.

01:24:57.884 --> 01:24:59.761
That's how we do it.

01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:02.439
That's our revenge.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:07.027
If I can take it,
I can make it.

01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:10.906
Precisely.

01:25:10.981 --> 01:25:12.483
My brother Pete
used to say that.

01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:15.160
He used to think that
I could do anything.

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:19.285
He used to think that I
was better than I am.

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:22.959
Who says you're not?

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.440
We're getting closer.

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.212
Why do you make me hit you?

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:00.640
Hmm?

01:27:09.975 --> 01:27:11.727
You are dead.

01:27:14.688 --> 01:27:19.410
In America,
they say Zamperini dead.

01:27:20.444 --> 01:27:24.745
They tell your family
you died in war.

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:27.246
NBC Radio tell America

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:32.001
famous Olympic runner
Zamperini is dead.

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:39.512
You want to tell family
you're not dead?

01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:42.052
These gentlemen,

01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:44.886
they're from Radio Tokyo.

01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:48.931
We have program
go all over world.

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:52.400
It is name <i>Postman Calls.</i>

01:27:59.149 --> 01:28:00.696
"Hello, Mother.

01:28:01.568 --> 01:28:03.366
"Your son is calling you.

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:06.330
"Mother, I love you.

01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:09.038
"I'm alive and well."

01:28:55.747 --> 01:28:57.749
I'm only saying
my own words.

01:28:57.833 --> 01:28:59.005
Of course.

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:20.022
Hello, America.

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:24.697
<i>This is
The Postman Calls.</i>

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:28.706
Today the postman calls for Mrs.
Louise Zamperini

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.124
of Torrance, California.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:34.829
Louie Zamperini is not
missing, and not dead

01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:38.256
as erroneously announced
by your government.

01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:41.961
He is safe
and sound with us.

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:44.717
So keep listening,
Mrs. Zamperini...

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:49.723
And don't mention it.
The pleasure is all ours.

01:29:54.306 --> 01:29:57.526
Hello, Mother and Father,
sisters and friends.

01:29:59.477 --> 01:30:01.605
This is your Louie talking.

01:30:02.314 --> 01:30:03.907
And the first
time in two years

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:05.734
that you will have
heard my voice.

01:30:08.778 --> 01:30:11.452
<i>I am uninjured
and in good health.</i>

01:30:15.493 --> 01:30:18.463
I am now interned in a
Tokyo prisoner of war camp

01:30:18.538 --> 01:30:22.168
being treated as
well as can be expected
under wartime conditions.

01:30:23.877 --> 01:30:28.724
<i>I hope Pete is still able
to pay you his weekly
visits from San Diego.</i>

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:32.886
Dad...

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.100
Keep my guns
in good condition

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:37.933
<i>so we can go hunting
when I get home.</i>

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:44.065
<i>Get some good rabbits
for Mom's gnocchi sauce.</i>

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:50.655
I wish you all
a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year.

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:57.539
Your loving son, Louie.

01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:33.913
You were good.

01:31:33.989 --> 01:31:35.241
Very good.

01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:40.249
You can speak
on radio again.

01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:55.560
I can't say this.

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:56.852
Why not?

01:31:56.928 --> 01:31:58.771
Because it's not true.

01:31:59.806 --> 01:32:02.525
What it says
about America,
I can't say that.

01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:06.988
They say that.

01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:09.907
American like you.

01:32:10.442 --> 01:32:11.659
They live here.

01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:13.657
Very comfortable.

01:32:13.737 --> 01:32:15.080
Good food.

01:32:18.825 --> 01:32:21.294
They have lovely food.

01:32:27.751 --> 01:32:29.048
You want to go
back to camp?

01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:35.301
You make broadcast.

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:29.650
You are like me.

01:33:30.522 --> 01:33:32.741
We are both strong.

01:33:34.025 --> 01:33:37.620
I saw it in your eyes...

01:33:37.695 --> 01:33:39.572
The first day.

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:41.995
I thought...

01:33:42.075 --> 01:33:45.875
This man will
be my friend.

01:33:48.873 --> 01:33:50.295
But...

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:53.719
Enemy of Japan.

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:57.428
You do not listen.

01:33:58.383 --> 01:34:01.557
You do not do
what is asked of you.

01:34:09.978 --> 01:34:13.323
It is necessary
to have respect.

01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:15.742
No respect...

01:34:16.609 --> 01:34:18.361
No order.

01:34:24.784 --> 01:34:28.038
This man must be
taught respect.

01:34:28.413 --> 01:34:32.668
All other prisoners
will teach him this lesson.

01:34:35.128 --> 01:34:37.130
Each prisoner...

01:34:37.755 --> 01:34:41.510
Will punch
this man in his face.

01:34:53.938 --> 01:34:55.315
Sir...

01:34:56.941 --> 01:34:58.784
We cannot do that.

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.317
Do it.

01:35:40.485 --> 01:35:42.829
Do it, sir. Come on.

01:35:43.905 --> 01:35:45.828
Just get it over with.

01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:48.751
Punch him
in the face.

01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:55.667
Come on.

01:35:56.459 --> 01:35:58.006
Punch him!

01:36:03.216 --> 01:36:04.263
Next!

01:36:04.884 --> 01:36:06.261
Go on.

01:36:06.344 --> 01:36:08.187
Come on, come on.

01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:15.190
Next!

01:36:17.647 --> 01:36:19.866
Okay. Come on,
come on, sir.

01:36:19.941 --> 01:36:21.739
Come on.

01:36:24.153 --> 01:36:25.245
Hit hard!
Come on!

01:36:25.321 --> 01:36:26.538
Hit me!

01:36:29.409 --> 01:36:30.581
Next!

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:34.126
Come on, Tink,
hit me good. Go on.

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.462
Next!

01:36:38.543 --> 01:36:39.886
Come on.

01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:42.092
Next!

01:36:51.597 --> 01:36:53.395
Hit hard!

01:36:56.352 --> 01:36:57.854
Next!

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:24.305
Harder!

01:37:31.137 --> 01:37:32.309
Next!

01:37:38.853 --> 01:37:40.070
Next!

01:37:44.984 --> 01:37:46.486
Next!

01:38:48.714 --> 01:38:49.715
Cinderella!

01:38:49.799 --> 01:38:50.799
Cinderella!

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:52.515
Ah, Cinderella!

01:38:52.635 --> 01:38:55.229
Where is that naughty little maggot?

01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:56.897
Have you seen her, fella?

01:38:57.849 --> 01:38:59.601
Ah, there you are,
you lazy little girl.

01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:01.607
How am I supposed to
get ready for the ball

01:39:01.686 --> 01:39:03.359
with you sitting
there doing nothing?

01:39:03.438 --> 01:39:04.781
That's as useful to us

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:06.608
as our morning
dance routines.

01:39:12.738 --> 01:39:14.081
Fix my dress

01:39:14.157 --> 01:39:17.161
so I can catch
the eye of the dreamy
Prince Hillenbrand.

01:39:17.243 --> 01:39:19.837
You couldn't catch
the eye of a prince
if it fell in your lap.

01:39:19.912 --> 01:39:22.085
Come, Cinders,
fix my hair.

01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:25.835
Fix my dress!

01:39:25.918 --> 01:39:27.135
Fix my hair!

01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:28.303
Dress!

01:39:28.379 --> 01:39:29.926
Hair, hair, hair!

01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:31.349
Are you speaking Kraut now?

01:39:31.424 --> 01:39:33.426
Enough! Enough!

01:39:33.509 --> 01:39:36.433
You guys make me
do all these stupid,
impossible things

01:39:36.512 --> 01:39:38.560
with no food
and no rest!

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:41.017
You lock me up
in a rabbit hutch.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:42.647
I've had enough!

01:39:43.394 --> 01:39:45.146
I have good news.

01:39:48.357 --> 01:39:50.325
I have had a promotion.

01:39:50.943 --> 01:39:52.741
That's the good news.

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:56.157
The bad news?

01:39:59.118 --> 01:40:01.621
I say goodbye
to my friends.

01:40:08.878 --> 01:40:11.506
I leave Omori tomorrow.

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:20.599
Nothing in this life
is hopeless, Cinders.

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:23.480
If you keep your
head and your heart

01:40:23.559 --> 01:40:26.904
you can do anything!

01:40:28.481 --> 01:40:30.233
Fear not, dear child...

01:40:30.816 --> 01:40:33.490
I am your
fairy godmother.

01:40:33.653 --> 01:40:35.826
You may
congratulate me.

01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:39.788
Mmm.

01:41:17.154 --> 01:41:19.577
And there he goes.

01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:22.743
Just like that.

01:41:37.383 --> 01:41:38.885
I have got...

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:40.977
Four kings.

01:41:41.387 --> 01:41:42.764
And there you go.

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.933
The baron's
been beaten, Tinker.

01:41:46.017 --> 01:41:47.769
Oh, yeah?
Sugar for us tonight.

01:42:42.531 --> 01:42:43.657
Got it, Miller?

01:42:43.741 --> 01:42:44.913
Send another bucket!

01:42:53.751 --> 01:42:55.879
We're helping
the Japs now?

01:42:56.754 --> 01:42:58.176
Might as well
let it burn.

01:42:58.255 --> 01:43:00.098
Pass it down!

01:43:01.425 --> 01:43:02.426
There you go.

01:43:16.565 --> 01:43:18.909
B-29s, boys!

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.947
Won't be long now.

01:43:23.447 --> 01:43:25.290
I wouldn't get too excited.

01:43:26.117 --> 01:43:28.370
If the Allies win,

01:43:28.452 --> 01:43:30.796
the Japs issue
kill-all orders.

01:43:32.623 --> 01:43:34.717
I overheard them.

01:43:36.627 --> 01:43:38.971
We win, we're dead.

01:43:41.966 --> 01:43:45.095
Well, what are we
supposed to be praying for?

01:43:47.304 --> 01:43:48.521
Down!
Get down!

01:43:54.603 --> 01:43:56.480
Grab your gear.
They're moving us out.

01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:02.328
To where?
I don't know.

01:44:02.403 --> 01:44:03.871
Some new camp.

01:44:04.363 --> 01:44:06.081
Tokyo Ritz.

01:44:06.157 --> 01:44:08.535
Some place the Allies
can't find us.

01:48:24.415 --> 01:48:27.259
This is Naoetsu prison camp.

01:48:29.003 --> 01:48:32.473
I am Sergeant Watanabe,

01:48:32.548 --> 01:48:34.676
your commanding officer.

01:48:36.051 --> 01:48:40.431
You are enemies of Japan.

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:43.442
You will be treated...

01:48:44.601 --> 01:48:46.649
Accordingly.

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:51.863
You will help
the Japanese

01:48:51.942 --> 01:48:54.616
by working on
the coal barges.

01:48:55.112 --> 01:48:58.616
Anyone who will
not work...

01:49:00.117 --> 01:49:01.960
Will be executed.

01:49:11.587 --> 01:49:13.931
Why don't you
look me in the eye?

01:49:20.679 --> 01:49:22.397
You boys
can sleep here.

01:49:26.477 --> 01:49:27.979
You two over there.

01:49:34.777 --> 01:49:36.529
This is the end, mates.

01:49:37.196 --> 01:49:38.664
No one knows you're here.

01:49:40.741 --> 01:49:42.914
It's best if you just
resign to your fate.

01:51:22.009 --> 01:51:24.762
Your President Roosevelt

01:51:27.723 --> 01:51:28.940
is dead.

01:52:46.843 --> 01:52:48.186
Louie?

01:52:52.808 --> 01:52:54.276
Louie?

01:52:57.604 --> 01:52:58.821
Are you all right?

01:54:23.106 --> 01:54:24.483
Pick up!

01:54:59.976 --> 01:55:01.068
Lift it.

01:55:03.897 --> 01:55:04.989
Lift it!

01:55:35.887 --> 01:55:37.264
Over your head.

01:56:02.873 --> 01:56:04.216
If he drops it

01:56:05.292 --> 01:56:06.339
shoot him.

01:58:03.577 --> 01:58:05.170
Come on, Louie.

01:58:06.204 --> 01:58:07.672
Come on, boy.

01:58:13.003 --> 01:58:14.471
Come on, Louie.

01:59:13.730 --> 01:59:15.073
Don't look at me.

01:59:17.609 --> 01:59:19.327
Don't look at me.

01:59:36.503 --> 01:59:37.925
Don't look at me!

01:59:38.296 --> 01:59:40.094
Don't look at me!

02:01:55.058 --> 02:01:57.561
"Prisoners of Naoetsu...

02:01:58.394 --> 02:02:02.240
"The war has come to
a point of cessation.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.343
"Today...

02:02:22.418 --> 02:02:26.594
"In the spirit of the new
future of our great nations,

02:02:28.049 --> 02:02:33.806
"we invite all prisoners
to bathe in the Hokura River."

02:02:39.727 --> 02:02:41.024
This is it.

02:02:43.022 --> 02:02:44.194
We're dead.

02:05:20.763 --> 02:05:22.891
That's our boys!
That's our boys!

02:05:22.974 --> 02:05:24.521
They've seen us!

02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:27.649
It's over!
The war is over!

02:08:47.511 --> 02:08:48.512
Louie!

02:09:08.032 --> 02:09:09.705
You made it.

02:09:09.992 --> 02:09:11.994
Oh, God,
look at you.

02:09:18.668 --> 02:09:20.511
Oh, Mama.
