Elliott Stabler,

shield number 6313.

12:30.271 --> 12:32.969
Over the last six months,
I've been undercover

12:33.013 --> 12:36.190

aka K-O.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.235

trafficking business.

from all the other drug dealers

13:07.874 --> 13:09.353

has gone to the source,

13:12.443 --> 13:15.490
Colombia, and they cut a deal.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.928
And they have taken
over the manufacturing,

13:18.972 --> 13:22.366
the transportation, the
distribution of their cocaine.

13:22.410 --> 13:26.370
They now control
their entire supply chain.

13:26.414 --> 13:30.200
- Hmm, and is it fair to say
that they've become bolder,

13:30.244 --> 13:33.116
more powerful,
and more dangerous as a result?

13:33.160 --> 13:35.858

criminal organization
