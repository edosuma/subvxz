WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:06.900
_

00:11.098 --> 00:13.048
Well, it is rustic,

00:13.100 --> 00:15.884
but it got five stars on Yelp.

00:15.936 --> 00:19.054
And one of the stars
was partially filled in.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.940
Oh, I'm so happy to
be here with my family,

00:22.026 --> 00:24.643
celebrating our anniversary.

00:24.728 --> 00:28.397
Just to think, 50 years ago,

00:28.449 --> 00:30.399
- to this very day, 
- Mm-hmm.

00:30.451 --> 00:32.747
John and I were on the dance floor,

00:32.772 --> 00:35.153
and his father grabbed my ass.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.645
Oh, oh, no, uh, Lark, honey,

00:37.682 --> 00:38.993
why don't you give me
that stuffy so he doesn't

00:39.017 --> 00:40.233
get dirty, okay?

00:40.318 --> 00:42.485
No, I need my armadilldo.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.964
Oh, uh, "dillo."

00:43.988 --> 00:45.404
She means "armadillo."

00:45.490 --> 00:47.824
Ever since we told her
about the baby coming,

00:47.859 --> 00:49.902
she's just so attached
to the stuffed animal.

00:49.927 --> 00:50.993
Hello!

00:51.029 --> 00:52.779
Welcome to the YucatÃ¡n!

00:52.804 --> 00:55.615
I am Hayes, and my wife, Rebecca, uh,

00:55.700 --> 00:57.617
I'm sure she's around somewhere.

00:57.702 --> 00:59.085
I'm not sure where, but...

00:59.170 --> 01:00.753
she is. Uh, anyway,

01:00.839 --> 01:03.172
it's almost sundown,
so it is time for bed.

01:03.208 --> 01:04.674
I will show you to your rooms.

01:04.709 --> 01:05.625
Wait,

01:05.710 --> 01:07.460
w-wait a minute. We just got here.

01:07.545 --> 01:08.928
We haven't eaten yet.

01:08.953 --> 01:11.380
Thank you. That reminds me.
Uh, no food in the rooms,

01:11.382 --> 01:14.778
'cause they will attract pretty
much, you know, uh, everything.

01:15.687 --> 01:17.164
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,

01:17.188 --> 01:18.499
you guys, look. Look at the black birds

01:18.523 --> 01:19.523
flying out of that hole.

01:19.557 --> 01:22.062
Yes, yes.

01:22.087 --> 01:24.443
Aren't they beautiful?
Yeah, those are vampire bats.

01:24.529 --> 01:27.230
Yep. Open wounds? Does
anybody have any open wounds?

01:27.282 --> 01:28.876
I would suggest
covering them immediately

01:28.900 --> 01:31.500
as you go to your rooms.
Briskly. Please walk quickly.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.070
Yep. They are aggressive. Okay.

01:34.122 --> 01:36.072
Yep, always walk in pairs. Never alone.

01:36.124 --> 01:37.657
Never alone here.

01:37.742 --> 01:38.658
I got it.

01:38.743 --> 01:40.126
Carry the child.

01:44.424 --> 01:46.165
All right, well, it's not that bad.

01:46.251 --> 01:49.502
You know? At least we have,
uh, our own private bathroom.

01:50.755 --> 01:52.421
It's just a hole.

01:52.473 --> 01:53.840
Maybe it's a laundry chute.

01:53.865 --> 01:57.950
Maybe. But there's
definitely feces in there.

01:58.096 --> 01:59.979
- Oh, my God.
- What?

02:00.064 --> 02:01.892
- Go, get it.
- Uh, uh, okay, I got it, I got it,

02:01.916 --> 02:03.416
I got it, I got it. I got it, I got it.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.923
Here we go, here we go.

02:04.948 --> 02:06.903
Ugh.

02:06.938 --> 02:08.487
Oh!

02:08.512 --> 02:11.050
- Oh.
- Tim, could you knock?

02:11.075 --> 02:12.992
Whoa, look at this.

02:13.077 --> 02:15.661
You guys have got
wall-to-wall floors?

02:17.115 --> 02:18.726
And your own hole?

02:18.751 --> 02:20.199
Tim, why aren't you in your hut?

02:20.285 --> 02:21.645
I need to borrow some antihistamine.

02:21.669 --> 02:23.452
One of the girls got bit really bad.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.621
Which one?

02:24.659 --> 02:26.100
I don't know. Her
face swelled up so bad,

02:26.124 --> 02:27.741
I can't even tell. I'm lucky though.

02:27.766 --> 02:31.204
They don't bite me. Um, I
guess my blood's too sweet.

02:31.229 --> 02:32.906
Ah! Look at this.

02:32.931 --> 02:33.931
A skylight!

02:33.965 --> 02:35.530
Oh!

02:35.555 --> 02:38.217
You know what? Maybe you
should take some, too.

02:38.303 --> 02:40.219
Just to be safe.

02:40.305 --> 02:42.638
Yeah. Yeah, my head is, like, throbbing.

02:42.690 --> 02:44.724
Maybe I got dehydrated on that flight.

02:44.809 --> 02:46.309
Thank you.

02:48.283 --> 02:50.099
Oh!

02:50.124 --> 02:52.398
It's under my eyelid!

02:52.483 --> 02:54.066
Mommy, I'm scared.

02:54.152 --> 02:57.069
Oh, no. No, Uncle Tim is probably fine.

02:57.155 --> 02:59.148
I mean, he stopped screaming, didn't he?

02:59.173 --> 03:01.908
No, I can't find Armadilldo.

03:01.993 --> 03:05.795
Okay. It's-it's
"dillo," Lark. Armadillo.

03:05.830 --> 03:07.830
Where did you last see him, honey?

03:08.631 --> 03:11.468
Out there, next to a bug.

03:14.491 --> 03:16.339
Well, everything's gonna be okay.

03:16.391 --> 03:18.591
We'll just have to go look
for him in the morning.

03:18.616 --> 03:19.676
No, I need him now.

03:19.727 --> 03:22.428
He'll die out there.

03:22.513 --> 03:24.013
- Oh...
- Find him, Daddy!

03:24.065 --> 03:25.209
Find him! It's all our fault. I mean,

03:25.233 --> 03:27.512
we're forcing a new baby on her, and now

03:27.537 --> 03:29.769
we've lost her only comfort in life.

03:29.794 --> 03:31.231
We didn't lose it, okay?

03:31.256 --> 03:34.657
I sewed in a GPS tracker onto Armadillo.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.529
You did what, now? And you can sew?

03:36.557 --> 03:38.535
Well, I wasn't about to lose the
only thing that she cares about.

03:38.559 --> 03:39.842
I put one in your shoe, too.

03:39.894 --> 03:41.143
My shoe?

03:41.179 --> 03:42.978
Yeah, that way, when
you come home from work,

03:43.014 --> 03:45.898
I know it's time to reheat dinner.

03:45.983 --> 03:50.142
Uh-huh. And it gives you time
to clear your browser history.

03:50.955 --> 03:53.739
Anyway, um, if you're here,

03:53.825 --> 03:56.275
then Armadillo is

03:56.360 --> 03:58.944
all the way out...

03:59.030 --> 04:01.914
there. Okay, yeah, no,
I-I'm not going out there.

04:01.999 --> 04:03.415
Fine. Then when Lark can't make

04:03.501 --> 04:05.918
meaningful emotional
connections with other people,

04:06.003 --> 04:10.033
we'll just tell her it's because
Daddy was afraid of a few bugs.

04:10.525 --> 04:11.774
I'm fine with that.

04:19.964 --> 04:21.574
All right, the bugs
were swarming my phone,

04:21.598 --> 04:23.358
so we're just gonna
have to do this tomorrow,

04:23.434 --> 04:25.567
unless you've got a better idea.

04:27.604 --> 04:29.988
You know, I don't think
you arming me with your shoe

04:30.074 --> 04:32.991
and a baby monitor qualifies
as a better idea, honey.

04:33.077 --> 04:34.526
This is genius.

04:34.611 --> 04:36.745
All right, I see you with my shoe,

04:36.780 --> 04:37.855
and there's the armadillo.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.365
Yeah, you're closing in.
This is a walk in the park.

04:41.618 --> 04:44.169
Spiders! Aah!

04:44.194 --> 04:46.004
Greg, you can do this,
okay? Just remember,

04:46.090 --> 04:48.123
- you're doing it for Lark.
- Yes, I know.

04:48.175 --> 04:49.958
What if we're just coddling her?

04:50.010 --> 04:51.934
We're not coddling her.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.678
She's freaked out about the baby.

04:53.703 --> 04:56.098
Maybe she just needs to understand that,

04:56.133 --> 04:57.944
you know, just because
there's a new baby doesn't mean

04:57.968 --> 04:59.384
that we love her any less.

04:59.470 --> 05:01.896
Okay, well, you're
making a lot of sense.

05:01.921 --> 05:03.438
Just bring back Armadillo,

05:03.474 --> 05:05.273
and we can talk about it.

05:05.309 --> 05:06.569
How much further?

05:06.594 --> 05:07.733
Just keep going straight.

05:07.848 --> 05:09.764
Good, yeah, love that hustle.

05:09.850 --> 05:13.385
Uh, Jen, I'm standing still.

05:13.437 --> 05:15.220
Okay, well, then we've got a problem,

05:15.272 --> 05:18.118
'cause one of you is moving.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.607
Is Armadillo moving?

05:19.693 --> 05:21.559
Hold on. I'm getting my dots mixed up.

05:21.611 --> 05:23.194
Is Armadillo moving?

05:23.230 --> 05:25.363
Oh, okay. Now I got it.

05:25.399 --> 05:27.041
Yes. Yes, he is.

05:27.066 --> 05:28.700
And at a pretty fast clip.

05:28.735 --> 05:29.735
Oh, my God.

05:29.786 --> 05:30.702
Something has him.

05:30.737 --> 05:31.703
He's running towards you.

05:31.738 --> 05:32.954
Greg, run!

05:33.040 --> 05:34.040
Don't drop my shoe!

05:34.074 --> 05:35.290
I'm gonna die.

05:35.375 --> 05:36.666
I'm gonna die, Jen.

05:38.745 --> 05:40.545
I'm dying right now.

05:40.580 --> 05:41.629
Greg?

05:41.715 --> 05:42.715
Rebecca?

05:43.800 --> 05:46.167
Oh. It's you. Sorry.

05:46.253 --> 05:48.169
I was looking for my
wife, and I found this.

05:48.255 --> 05:49.754
I-I thought it may be a clue.

05:49.806 --> 05:51.172
Oh, my gosh. You found it.

05:51.258 --> 05:53.174
Thank you!

05:53.260 --> 05:55.404
Oh! This is my daughter's.

05:55.429 --> 05:57.178
Oh. Okay.

05:57.264 --> 05:58.864
Wait, do you not know
where your wife is?

05:58.932 --> 05:59.932
No, I kn...

05:59.983 --> 06:01.943
I know where she is.

06:01.968 --> 06:03.318
Rebecca!

06:03.403 --> 06:06.354
They need more towels in hut six!

06:06.609 --> 06:10.525
Rebecca. Where are
you? You're scaring me.

06:12.265 --> 06:14.413
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Greg.

06:14.438 --> 06:15.830
Oh, yes.

06:15.855 --> 06:17.699
You are absolutely
the bravest man I know.

06:17.784 --> 06:19.084
It was nothing, babe.

06:19.119 --> 06:20.730
I mean, I'm-I'm just...
I'm so glad, you know,

06:20.754 --> 06:22.514
that you didn't give
up, because now Lark has

06:22.589 --> 06:24.923
what she needs to feel loved and secure.

06:24.958 --> 06:26.925
We're not coddling her.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.510
I was just scared.

06:28.595 --> 06:29.511
Yeah.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:39.306 --> 06:40.722
- Dillo ran away? 
- Mm-hmm.

06:40.807 --> 06:42.168
I'll write the good-bye
note with my left hand.

06:42.192 --> 06:43.807
- She'll never know.
- Great.

06:44.945 --> 06:46.671
_

06:46.696 --> 06:48.730
Okay, so, we have zip-lining,

06:48.815 --> 06:49.898
bungee jumping,

06:49.923 --> 06:51.232
spelunking...

06:51.318 --> 06:53.068
The caves.

06:53.153 --> 06:55.153
That's probably where Rebecca is hiding.

06:55.178 --> 06:56.905
Yes, let's do spelunking.

06:56.990 --> 06:58.790
Aw, I wanted to do the caves.

06:58.815 --> 07:00.853
Oh, they're great. They
have a crystal forest there

07:00.877 --> 07:01.998
that will blow your mind.

07:02.023 --> 07:03.661
Tyler, you love crystals.

07:03.713 --> 07:06.164
- I like crystals.
- Well, someone loves crystals.

07:06.216 --> 07:07.882
- Sam, is that you?
- No.

07:07.968 --> 07:09.884
It's gonna ruin my day.

07:09.970 --> 07:11.419
It's me. I love crystals.

07:11.444 --> 07:12.949
Hey, you know what?
They'll take pictures.

07:12.973 --> 07:15.890
You big kids go have
fun, and Sophia and I

07:15.976 --> 07:18.393
will have our own wild
adventure right here, huh?

07:18.478 --> 07:21.228
Oh, that's right. You
love Billy Crystal.

07:21.306 --> 07:23.648
I like Billy Crystal.

07:25.931 --> 07:27.735
I want to do what you guys are doing.

07:27.821 --> 07:29.270
This is gonna suck.

07:29.356 --> 07:32.240
Sorry. Looks like you're
Mom's vacation buddy.

07:32.325 --> 07:34.909
I always am. Dad should have to be.

07:34.995 --> 07:36.444
He's the one who married her.

07:36.530 --> 07:39.030
But your dad can't do a
mother-daughter fashion show.

07:39.082 --> 07:40.365
There's a fashion show?

07:40.417 --> 07:42.283
Yeah.

07:43.062 --> 07:44.869
"Fashion in the Jungle."

07:44.921 --> 07:46.538
How many times

07:46.590 --> 07:49.133
do you think Mom's
gonna roar during this?

07:49.158 --> 07:51.697
Just tell Mom that you
want to come with us.

07:51.760 --> 07:52.737
I can't.

07:52.762 --> 07:55.263
Remember when I tried calling
her Mom instead of Mommy?

07:55.348 --> 07:57.465
She cried for a whole week.

07:57.551 --> 08:00.552
I had to wet the bed again
to make her feel better.

08:00.604 --> 08:02.720
We all bailed on her
at some point, Soph.

08:02.772 --> 08:04.556
I did when the breastfeeding ended.

08:04.608 --> 08:07.108
I don't like that I
can still remember that.

08:07.133 --> 08:10.145
Or do what I do. Ignore
her, then when she asks why,

08:10.230 --> 08:12.530
scream at her and say
she's embarrassing.

08:12.566 --> 08:14.399
And if that fails, you
can just convince Mom

08:14.451 --> 08:16.818
to have another kid.
She's still fertile.

08:16.903 --> 08:17.952
Ew.

08:18.038 --> 08:20.655
What? Dad told me. I didn't ask.

08:20.740 --> 08:24.626
So, we walk like this on
the runway in our beachwear,

08:24.651 --> 08:26.982
and then we stop. Pose.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.330
And then you throw a beach ball.

08:29.416 --> 08:31.624
That sounds really fun.

08:31.843 --> 08:33.585
But it's so much work,

08:33.636 --> 08:35.553
and you're on vacation.

08:35.589 --> 08:38.556
You should get to relax,
and I'll just go zip-lining.

08:38.592 --> 08:40.674
Listen, th-this is relaxing to me.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.510
I love spending time with you.

08:42.596 --> 08:44.939
You have so much love to give.

08:44.979 --> 08:46.900
Why not try giving it to someone new?

08:46.925 --> 08:49.259
Someone younger? Balder?

08:49.284 --> 08:51.080
Oh, honestly, if I was
gonna cheat on your dad,

08:51.104 --> 08:53.271
it would be with a guy
with a full head of hair.

08:53.323 --> 08:54.906
No, I mean a baby.

08:54.941 --> 08:56.908
Is that what this is about?

08:56.943 --> 08:59.410
Oh, honey, are you worried that
I'm gonna have another baby?

08:59.446 --> 09:01.329
- What? No.
- Oh, honey, no. Listen,

09:01.414 --> 09:03.038
you will always be my baby.

09:03.063 --> 09:04.759
- Oh, I...
- Oh, come here.

09:04.784 --> 09:06.668
Oh, you feel better?

09:07.022 --> 09:10.513
Well, I've been bitten
by the spelunking bug.

09:10.538 --> 09:11.339
Mm.

09:11.424 --> 09:13.541
But to be fair, I did antagonize him.

09:13.627 --> 09:16.705
- I'm getting Dad antihistamine, okay?
- Great.

09:19.015 --> 09:21.349
Uh-oh. Hey, what's wrong?

09:21.374 --> 09:23.101
Nothing. You'll tell Mom.

09:23.136 --> 09:24.435
Hey, you can tell me anything.

09:24.471 --> 09:26.554
I will always keep it just between us.

09:27.939 --> 09:29.474
- Sophia hates you.
- Oh.

09:29.526 --> 09:32.026
She doesn't hate me. Sophia's
my little baby sweet pea.

09:32.051 --> 09:34.351
Okay, she doesn't hate
you. She hates that.

09:34.376 --> 09:36.481
She's tired of all the little kid stuff.

09:36.533 --> 09:38.041
She just doesn't know how to tell you.

09:38.065 --> 09:39.400
Sophia can tell me anything.

09:39.425 --> 09:41.069
That's what our snuggle time is for.

09:41.094 --> 09:42.537
I don't think you're hearing me.

09:42.622 --> 09:43.721
She doesn't want to tell
you 'cause she doesn't want

09:43.745 --> 09:45.851
to hurt your feelings. She
knows that once she's older,

09:45.875 --> 09:47.186
all you're gonna have to look forward to

09:47.210 --> 09:49.627
is mall walking and irregular periods.

09:49.663 --> 09:51.266
She said that?

09:51.291 --> 09:54.215
Well, no, I said it, but she agreed.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.444
Oh, my God. I'm the one
who's supposed to be worried

09:56.469 --> 09:59.420
about her feelings, and
she's worried about me.

09:59.506 --> 10:01.639
Oh, I'm a terrible mother.

10:01.675 --> 10:03.925
Only in this instance specifically.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.810
You know, the whole time
I've just been saying

10:05.845 --> 10:07.979
that Sophia's not ready to
grow up, but you know what?

10:08.014 --> 10:09.814
I'm the one who's not ready.

10:09.849 --> 10:11.482
Well, hey, you should be happy.

10:11.518 --> 10:12.900
You know? Your job's done now.

10:12.986 --> 10:15.937
Finally just you and I get to hang out.

10:16.022 --> 10:17.272
Of course, I'll be at work,

10:17.357 --> 10:19.077
but you'll find something
to fill your time.

10:23.029 --> 10:24.996
- Go, Sam!
- Whoo!

10:27.000 --> 10:28.916
Oh!

10:31.338 --> 10:33.254
So, what should we do now?

10:33.340 --> 10:34.706
Play I Spy?

10:34.758 --> 10:36.519
Yes. Okay, I want to go first.

10:36.543 --> 10:39.460
I spy, I spy with my little eye

10:39.546 --> 10:43.681
a girl who is ready to try zip-lining.

10:43.717 --> 10:45.633
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

10:45.719 --> 10:46.768
Thanks, Mommy.

10:46.853 --> 10:48.386
Oh!

10:48.438 --> 10:50.518
You can call me Mom.

10:56.529 --> 10:58.813
You know what? I think
I left the stove on.

10:58.898 --> 11:00.698
We should get to that. Nope.

11:00.734 --> 11:03.284
Oh, sweetie, listen, you don't
have to protect me anymore.

11:03.370 --> 11:06.154
Okay? It's time for us
to both be big girls.

11:06.239 --> 11:08.039
No, I'm really scared.

11:08.074 --> 11:10.458
I know you are, honey. So am I.

11:11.795 --> 11:13.628
All right, let her go.

11:15.415 --> 11:17.048
I love you!

11:23.142 --> 11:25.063
_

11:27.363 --> 11:29.058
Hi, I'm back.

11:29.143 --> 11:31.659
How are you doing?
Did you get any sleep?

11:31.684 --> 11:33.290
No. I've been sitting
here for eight hours,

11:33.314 --> 11:34.780
praying that nothing lays any eggs

11:34.816 --> 11:36.315
- in any of my face holes. 
- Mm-hmm.

11:36.367 --> 11:37.928
Well, what if I told
you I figured out a way

11:37.952 --> 11:39.452
to fix this whole vacation?

11:39.487 --> 11:41.567
I'd call you a liar, and
I'd spit in your lying face.

11:41.623 --> 11:44.323
I'm serious. Remember that
really pretty, fancy hotel

11:44.375 --> 11:45.775
- we passed on our way in? 
- Uh-huh.

11:45.808 --> 11:49.025
Well, I called, and I splurged,
and I got the last room.

11:49.111 --> 11:51.454
Yay!

11:51.501 --> 11:53.563
Are you speechless because
you love it so much?

11:53.625 --> 11:54.498
Oh, honey. No.

11:54.523 --> 11:56.098
- I-I love you so much for trying, 
- Uh-huh.

11:56.122 --> 11:57.203
but, um...

11:57.228 --> 11:58.535
We can't go.

11:58.620 --> 11:59.736
That's just not an option.

11:59.822 --> 12:01.182
But why not? You're miserable here.

12:01.206 --> 12:02.467
Well, yeah, but we're all miserable.

12:02.491 --> 12:03.740
It's a family vacation.

12:03.826 --> 12:05.375
That's what family vacations are.

12:05.461 --> 12:07.305
Oh, you are so lucky that
your father abandoned you

12:07.329 --> 12:09.169
and you didn't have to
go on a family vacation.

12:09.214 --> 12:10.532
Yeah, but nobody has to know.

12:10.557 --> 12:12.632
We're only gonna spend our nights there.

12:12.668 --> 12:14.551
Like when I dated my professor.

12:14.636 --> 12:16.554
Yeah. I get it.

12:16.579 --> 12:18.839
I just can't do it. It would
break my parents' heart.

12:18.884 --> 12:19.781
And also,

12:19.806 --> 12:21.820
I have an agreement in
place with the spiders.

12:21.845 --> 12:24.344
I don't go out there, and
they don't come in here.

12:24.396 --> 12:26.342
Well, you should've made that
same deal with the snakes.

12:26.366 --> 12:27.291
What snakes?

12:27.316 --> 12:29.818
- Oh! God!
- What?

12:37.459 --> 12:40.026
I love that the only animals
in here are made of towels.

12:40.078 --> 12:42.913
And I love that you won't
cry yourself to sleep tonight.

12:47.053 --> 12:48.755
You okay, Sam?

12:48.780 --> 12:49.953
What a night.

12:50.038 --> 12:53.108
I am never going to complain
about anything again.

12:53.850 --> 12:55.569
This is breakfast?

12:55.594 --> 12:57.427
Yeah, I'm sorry about all this.

12:57.513 --> 12:58.866
I'm a little distracted.

12:58.891 --> 13:01.905
Seems like someone has
cleared out our bank account

13:02.050 --> 13:05.147
and also stolen my wife's passport.

13:05.975 --> 13:06.975
Hey.

13:07.022 --> 13:09.439
I slept like I had five
margaritas last night,

13:09.525 --> 13:11.645
which is weird because I had seven.

13:11.670 --> 13:12.809
How did you guys sleep?

13:12.895 --> 13:15.529
- No sleep.
- If you want to call it sleep, you can.

13:15.564 --> 13:17.341
Hey! There's my wonderful family.

13:17.366 --> 13:19.067
- Morning.
- Good morning.

13:19.092 --> 13:20.650
- Hi.
- What's on the agenda for today?

13:20.850 --> 13:24.120
Well, Hayes is going
to take us to the beach.

13:24.984 --> 13:28.041
And all we have to do
is ride in a trailer

13:28.076 --> 13:30.243
on the back of a tractor for two hours.

13:30.295 --> 13:32.829
And don't worry, we have water to share.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.130
- Oh, that's great.
- Yay! Fun.

13:34.155 --> 13:35.560
But, I mean, this whole
vacation has been great.

13:35.584 --> 13:37.834
- Yeah.
- Oh, what a wonderful attitude,

13:37.920 --> 13:41.054
honey. I forget how great
your face is when you smile.

13:41.089 --> 13:44.341
Aw, how could anyone not
smile when we are so blessed

13:44.426 --> 13:46.393
to be together in this
beautiful paradise?

13:46.428 --> 13:49.179
- Mm-hmm. 
- Whoa, who just leapt over Tim

13:49.264 --> 13:50.742
in the in-law rankings?

13:50.766 --> 13:52.243
- Yes!
- I mean, if I had such a thing,

13:52.267 --> 13:53.350
which I don't.

13:53.435 --> 13:56.309
All right. Who's ready
to attack the day?

13:56.334 --> 13:58.778
Whoo! I love the beach. The beach.

13:58.803 --> 14:00.559
- Absolutely. Huh?
- Hey.

14:00.584 --> 14:02.192
What is this? All right.

14:02.277 --> 14:04.055
Why aren't you as
miserable as the rest of us?

14:04.079 --> 14:05.557
Yeah, why do you look
like you smell good?

14:05.581 --> 14:07.113
Why would you smell good?

14:07.165 --> 14:09.332
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

14:09.418 --> 14:10.812
- Just want to smell you. Oh, come on.
- Heather.

14:10.836 --> 14:13.837
- Just a sni... Oh!
- Hey.

14:13.922 --> 14:16.984
Sandalwood. He smells like sandalwood.

14:17.009 --> 14:17.945
Hey.

14:17.970 --> 14:20.210
What?

14:20.295 --> 14:23.671
What do you need a key card
for? Our door is a sheet.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.724
Okay, fine. Last night we slept

14:25.749 --> 14:27.749
at that really nice
resort down the road.

14:27.848 --> 14:28.946
_

14:28.971 --> 14:31.388
You broke the first
rule of family vacation.

14:31.473 --> 14:33.254
We are supposed to suffer together.

14:33.279 --> 14:35.420
I know. I really wanted
to suffer with all of you,

14:35.444 --> 14:37.811
- but she just loves me too much.
- I do.

14:37.863 --> 14:40.363
You know, I hate to do this,
but I'm gonna have to tell Mom.

14:40.449 --> 14:42.148
Oh, you don't hate
doing this. You love it.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.366
You're absolutely right.

14:43.452 --> 14:44.796
This could be the best part of my trip.

14:44.820 --> 14:46.286
Okay, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

14:46.321 --> 14:48.538
What if I tell you
there's a way for us all

14:48.624 --> 14:52.005
to have a great vacation and
still not disappoint your mom?

14:52.030 --> 14:55.169
I'd call you a liar and
I'd spit in your lying face.

14:55.232 --> 14:56.842
- Oh, so this is like a family thing?
- Yeah.

14:56.866 --> 14:57.866
Okay.

14:58.091 --> 15:00.347
- Wow.
- To my beautiful wife

15:00.372 --> 15:02.168
and her incredibly
dysfunctional upbringing,

15:02.220 --> 15:03.837
which has taught us all

15:03.889 --> 15:06.089
that sometimes to
have a family vacation,

15:06.174 --> 15:08.308
you need to escape a family vacation.

15:08.343 --> 15:10.360
- Aw, thank you.
- Cheers.

15:10.385 --> 15:11.302
That's right.

15:11.346 --> 15:13.096
Ooh! Oh, that's our seafood towers.

15:13.181 --> 15:14.628
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Towers?
- Oh...

15:14.652 --> 15:16.650
You guys, this is all
going on my credit card.

15:16.685 --> 15:18.652
Where are all the towels?

15:18.687 --> 15:20.320
Sorry. I had to use a bottom towel,

15:20.355 --> 15:21.688
a top towel and a hair towel.

15:21.740 --> 15:23.698
Uh, and you guys are
out of toilet paper.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.336
I'd been holding it for five days.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.193
And remember, I called dibs on shower

15:27.245 --> 15:28.445
once Jen and Lark are out.

15:28.530 --> 15:29.829
Perfect. I'm gonna take a bath.

15:29.865 --> 15:31.732
We can do it at the same
time since they're separate.

15:31.756 --> 15:32.839
Separate how?

15:32.924 --> 15:34.117
Get over yourself, Greg.

15:34.202 --> 15:35.869
I've seen you naked tons of times.

15:36.216 --> 15:37.632
When?

15:37.657 --> 15:39.956
Well, you may have saved
the family vacation,

15:40.042 --> 15:41.591
but they have ruined ours.

15:41.677 --> 15:43.793
Oh, you guys got to try these daiquiris.

15:43.879 --> 15:45.762
They're bachelorette party-sized.

15:45.847 --> 15:47.130
How many have you had?

15:47.215 --> 15:49.382
I don't know, but this one's
going straight to my head.

15:49.434 --> 15:51.362
Greg, you're gonna have to
keep an eye on me in that bath,

15:51.386 --> 15:53.520
I tell you what.

15:53.555 --> 15:55.388
I'll keep an eye on you, too.

15:56.432 --> 15:58.849
We can look at each
other while we do it.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.894
_

16:04.954 --> 16:08.405
So I still don't get why we
gave Jen and Greg our room.

16:08.491 --> 16:10.491
She's pregnant, John.

16:10.543 --> 16:12.493
She's been throwing up the whole trip.

16:12.545 --> 16:15.699
Well, this is Mexico.
Everybody's throwing up.

16:15.894 --> 16:17.760
You know, it's our 50th, Joanie.

16:17.785 --> 16:20.801
This should've been a romantic
getaway... just the two of us.

16:20.836 --> 16:25.096
Oh, honey. What better
way to celebrate 50 years

16:25.121 --> 16:27.455
than being with our entire family?

16:27.540 --> 16:29.073
Celebrating alone.

16:29.117 --> 16:31.671
Hey, did you see that resort
we passed on the way here?

16:31.746 --> 16:35.381
For the same money, we could've
got a real fancy room there.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.133
And abandon our family?

16:37.158 --> 16:39.502
What kind of a terrible
person does that?

16:39.588 --> 16:43.974
It's not terrible to want one
romantic night with your wife.

16:43.999 --> 16:46.225
Or at least a hard 15 minutes.

16:46.261 --> 16:48.474
Well, come up here.

16:48.499 --> 16:50.229
I don't want to lose it on the climb.

16:50.265 --> 16:51.999
Why don't you come down here?

16:52.024 --> 16:55.309
John, it took me 20
minutes to get up here.

16:57.606 --> 17:00.940
That's a poisonous ant. Don't touch it.

17:00.992 --> 17:04.454
- That's a poisonous frog. Don't touch it.
- Okay.

17:04.913 --> 17:08.929
That's a poisonous
lizard. Rebecca left me.

17:08.954 --> 17:11.144
This guy doesn't stop yapping.

17:11.169 --> 17:15.119
And, uh, up ahead is the
crown jewel of our property,

17:15.145 --> 17:16.506
an old burial ground.

17:16.531 --> 17:18.512
Oh! A Mayan burial ground?

17:18.537 --> 17:21.544
Well, it's more of a
drug cartel burial ground.

17:21.630 --> 17:24.513
But there is a beautiful
waterfall next to it.

17:24.598 --> 17:26.799
It was Rebecca's favorite.

17:26.851 --> 17:28.599
But I'm sure she'll be happy in Dayton,

17:28.624 --> 17:30.067
- right?
- Oh.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.638
- Joanie.
- Got her old job back.

17:31.690 --> 17:33.822
Let's take a closer look at this tree.

17:33.847 --> 17:36.025
- What tree?
- Who cares?

17:36.111 --> 17:37.894
The only thing I want to see is you.

17:37.979 --> 17:40.613
Oh, sweetie. Can't you
just make the best of it?

17:40.649 --> 17:42.315
I have the best of it.

17:42.384 --> 17:43.750
And look where we are.

17:43.818 --> 17:45.568
Look, it's paradise.

17:45.654 --> 17:48.321
And you're still the
most beautiful thing here.

17:48.373 --> 17:50.629
Oh, John. Mm.

17:50.654 --> 17:51.735
Come on, honey.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.159
We should keep up with the tour.

17:53.211 --> 17:55.642
The graves, the waterfall.

17:55.667 --> 17:56.796
We'll catch up, huh.

17:56.831 --> 17:59.048
Uh, we just need a hard 15 minutes.

17:59.134 --> 18:01.551
A hard 15 in the jungle?

18:03.104 --> 18:05.087
This is all your fault!

18:05.112 --> 18:09.142
We're stumbling around a
jungle, lost for two hours.

18:09.177 --> 18:12.929
I'll never see my family again,
and I'm worried about Hayes.

18:12.954 --> 18:15.848
I think he's-he's clinically depressed.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.316
Listen to me, Joanie.

18:17.352 --> 18:18.768
We're gonna get through this.

18:18.853 --> 18:20.019
Trust me.

18:20.071 --> 18:21.487
A road.

18:21.523 --> 18:22.989
Oh, thank God.

18:23.024 --> 18:24.991
Oh, I thought, sure, we were gonna die.

18:25.026 --> 18:26.026
Oh, thank you.

18:26.077 --> 18:28.433
Oh, please.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.230
Oh, stop. Help here!

18:30.255 --> 18:31.246
Here, let me help you.

18:31.271 --> 18:33.616
No! You've done enough.

18:33.641 --> 18:35.585
You and your selfish jungle sex.

18:35.670 --> 18:38.371
Why can't you be more like the kids?

18:38.423 --> 18:40.456
They just want to be with us.

18:42.877 --> 18:45.269
Thank you so much.

18:50.628 --> 18:51.634
Okay, Mom.

18:51.659 --> 18:53.853
Before you say anything, just know

18:53.888 --> 18:55.212
that staying at the nice hotel

18:55.237 --> 18:57.190
- was all Colleen's idea.
- What?!

18:57.225 --> 18:59.358
- Yeah. She practically forced us to do it.
- Yeah.

18:59.394 --> 19:01.519
So remember that next time
you're ranking the in-laws.

19:01.544 --> 19:02.457
Narc.

19:02.482 --> 19:04.047
Are you telling me

19:04.072 --> 19:07.255
you've been sneaking
off to a fancy resort?

19:09.121 --> 19:10.788
Our children suck.

19:12.373 --> 19:14.407
Well, I hope you're all happy.

19:14.459 --> 19:18.878
Now your mom has a broken
heart and possibly a broken leg.

19:18.913 --> 19:20.079
What happened to her leg?

19:20.131 --> 19:22.415
Well, we got lost deep in the jungle,

19:22.467 --> 19:24.566
and then the terrain
was very treacherous.

19:24.637 --> 19:25.528
But-but before that,

19:25.553 --> 19:27.920
she slipped on a rock
while we were doing it.

19:27.972 --> 19:29.116
- Dad.
- TMI.

19:29.140 --> 19:30.423
Noice.

19:30.475 --> 19:32.364
Look, your mom went out of her way

19:32.389 --> 19:34.143
to give us a great vacation.

19:34.229 --> 19:36.929
Now we have to find a way
to make her feel better.

19:37.129 --> 19:40.065
I wish I could give you my armadilldo.

19:40.090 --> 19:42.318
It's "dillo," Lark.

19:42.403 --> 19:44.187
Okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait.

19:44.212 --> 19:46.689
What if I told you there's a
way for you to salvage your trip

19:46.798 --> 19:50.376
and still have the most
amazing anniversary ever?

19:51.306 --> 19:55.141
I'd call you a liar and
spit in your lying face.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.309
We want to thank you kids.

20:03.378 --> 20:05.657
This is exactly what we wanted.

20:05.701 --> 20:08.399
I can't believe it's 50 years,

20:08.443 --> 20:12.220
and look at this beautiful
family we've created.

20:12.245 --> 20:15.284
Yeah. What your mother's
trying to say is...

20:15.309 --> 20:16.538
beat it.

20:17.501 --> 20:19.417
It's our anniversary.

20:20.542 --> 20:23.023
I cannot believe they
wouldn't let us stay with them.

20:23.048 --> 20:24.112
Hey, well, at least Mom and Dad

20:24.136 --> 20:25.510
are having a happy anniversary, right?

20:25.534 --> 20:27.144
Yeah, that's something.

20:27.187 --> 20:28.338
Tim, when did you get that tattoo

20:28.362 --> 20:29.581
of a scorpion on your neck?

20:29.625 --> 20:31.278
I don't have a scorpion tattoo.

20:31.322 --> 20:33.557
Oh, my God. Nobody move!

20:38.362 --> 20:39.712
Here come the bats.

20:39.737 --> 20:40.549
Oh.

20:40.592 --> 20:42.246
Run!

20:43.421 --> 20:46.206
Tim, you have a scorpion on your neck!

20:46.250 --> 20:47.381
Don't leave me here!

20:47.425 --> 20:48.774
I love you!
