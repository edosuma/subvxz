00:39.334 --> 00:40.467
We're not a threat.

00:40.534 --> 00:41.901
We're salvation.

00:41.968 --> 00:43.934
The world
will have to deal with us.

00:44.001 --> 00:45.367
<i>Previously on the 4400...</i>

00:45.434 --> 00:46.701
as far as
this department knew,

00:46.767 --> 00:48.500
Maia wasn't having
visions anymore.

00:48.567 --> 00:50.133
She was keeping them
secret from me

00:50.200 --> 00:51.500
and writing everything
down in a diary.

00:51.567 --> 00:52.601
It's a subpoena.

00:52.667 --> 00:53.667
What do they want?

00:53.734 --> 00:54.867
Your diary.

00:54.934 --> 00:56.100
Don't reveal
your healing ability,

00:56.167 --> 00:58.100
because if you heal
one of them,

00:58.167 --> 00:59.367
you're going
to have to heal them all.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.367
One day,

01:00.434 --> 01:01.901
all of this will be yours.

01:01.968 --> 01:04.834
The paperwork's been drawn up.
The lawyers know what to do.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.034
Everything's in place.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.634
He had a vision
to save the future,

01:10.701 --> 01:11.767
and now he won't be here

01:11.834 --> 01:14.467
to see us achieve it.

01:14.534 --> 01:15.834
But we will achieve.

01:15.901 --> 01:18.601
None of this
is real to me either.

01:18.667 --> 01:20.200
This is where they altered us,

01:20.267 --> 01:21.567
gave me the ability

01:21.634 --> 01:23.300
to create the world
we've been living in

01:23.367 --> 01:24.801
for the last eight years.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.034
I love you, thomas.

01:31.367 --> 01:35.400
So, let me see
if i've got this, um, straight.

01:36.367 --> 01:37.601
You two met,

01:37.667 --> 01:39.001
fell in love,

01:39.068 --> 01:39.968
and spent eight years
together

01:40.034 --> 01:41.400
in some kind of...

01:41.467 --> 01:42.701
alternate reality,

01:42.767 --> 01:44.434
and now you're here,

01:44.500 --> 01:47.100
with eight years of love
and marriage under your belts,

01:47.167 --> 01:48.400
in what to us was...

01:48.467 --> 01:49.767
no time at all.

01:49.834 --> 01:52.567
Yeah, that...
that about sums it up.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.068
Yeah.

01:54.133 --> 01:55.734
I'll play along.

01:55.801 --> 01:58.167
But if you two start
calling each other "honeybunny,"

01:58.233 --> 01:59.300
i'm so out of here.

01:59.367 --> 02:01.968
I told you
he'd try, thomas.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.734
How'd you know that?

02:03.801 --> 02:05.367
Well, you might be meeting me
for the first time,

02:05.434 --> 02:06.667
but i know all about you.

02:06.734 --> 02:07.734
You're smart,

02:07.801 --> 02:08.834
your favorite writer
is alan moore,

02:08.901 --> 02:10.001
and your favorite meal

02:10.068 --> 02:12.001
is meatloaf.

02:12.068 --> 02:13.167
But i can't be
exactly the same.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.567
You said there was no 4400,

02:14.634 --> 02:19.267
so that means
no coma, no time lost...

02:19.334 --> 02:20.534
no major problems.
That's right.

02:20.601 --> 02:21.634
You were happy.

02:21.701 --> 02:23.634
Successful.

02:23.701 --> 02:25.801
Meaning what?

02:25.867 --> 02:27.367
Nothing.

02:27.434 --> 02:28.634
We used to talk about
medical school, remember?

02:28.701 --> 02:30.100
Over there,
you went to stanford.

02:30.167 --> 02:32.034
How'd i do?

02:32.100 --> 02:33.467
You graduated
with honors.

02:33.534 --> 02:34.968
You became
a neurologist.

02:35.034 --> 02:36.167
Must have made you proud.

02:36.233 --> 02:38.467
I'm always proud of you.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.767
Right, but "dr. Kyle baldwin"

02:40.834 --> 02:42.801
and that world
you were vacationing in,

02:42.867 --> 02:44.034
it came from your mind,
right?

02:45.267 --> 02:46.834
Actually, it was my mind.

02:46.901 --> 02:47.867
Right,
but you created it

02:47.934 --> 02:49.100
using his memories.

02:49.167 --> 02:50.367
Kyle, i'm just as proud

02:50.434 --> 02:51.701
of what
you've accomplished here.

02:51.767 --> 02:52.834
Prouder.

03:01.901 --> 03:03.334
Hey.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.734
You want to know why
all lawyers are jerks?

03:05.801 --> 03:07.500
Because they spend
a lifetime

03:07.567 --> 03:09.434
reading this crap.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.867
What kind of crap,
specifically?

03:11.934 --> 03:14.233
I'm a pretty good
interpreter.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.901
I have 24 hours

03:15.968 --> 03:18.001
to turn Maia's diary over
to NTAC,

03:18.068 --> 03:20.200
and not one legal option
to get out of it.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.567
What are you going to do?

03:21.634 --> 03:23.068
Well, what NTAC wants,
NTAC gets,

03:23.133 --> 03:24.801
but i have a 9-year-old
daughter at home

03:24.867 --> 03:26.500
who's counting on me
to protect her.

03:26.567 --> 03:27.734
Any way i can help?

03:27.801 --> 03:29.701
Yeah, you can slap me
upside the head

03:29.767 --> 03:31.534
for ever mentioning the diary
in the first place.

03:31.601 --> 03:34.534
It didn't save collier's life,
and now it's making mine hell.

03:34.601 --> 03:37.734
How about i just make
some fresh coffee instead?

03:38.867 --> 03:40.567
Oh... thanks.

03:40.634 --> 03:42.334
Yeah.

03:48.001 --> 03:49.001
Do you think
they'll find

03:49.068 --> 03:50.601
the man
who did it?

03:50.667 --> 03:52.968
If, by "they,"
you mean "thomas,"

03:53.034 --> 03:54.634
then yeah, probably.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.133
My dad always gets
his man.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.233
You heading out?

03:57.300 --> 03:59.701
Yes, i have to keep
reminding myself

03:59.767 --> 04:00.968
i don't live here
anymore.

04:05.667 --> 04:07.200
Look, kyle,

04:07.267 --> 04:09.068
your father and i
love each other.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.267
That's great.

04:12.334 --> 04:13.734
There's not enough love
in the world.

04:13.801 --> 04:15.801
But i just met you.

04:15.867 --> 04:17.399
Give me a few days

04:17.466 --> 04:18.867
before i start
calling you "mom," okay?

04:20.334 --> 04:21.867
You've got
one of those already.

04:21.934 --> 04:24.734
I'll settle for being
a good friend...

04:24.801 --> 04:26.734
and i'll keep bribing you
with meatloaf

04:26.801 --> 04:28.834
until you give in.

05:10.001 --> 05:11.034
Oh...

05:39.534 --> 05:44.534
* so long ago, another life *

05:44.601 --> 05:48.467
* i can feel your heart beat *

05:48.534 --> 05:53.901
* it's not a dream
remember us *

05:53.968 --> 05:58.167
* i can see it in your eyes *

05:58.233 --> 06:01.434
* we'll find our place in time *

06:01.500 --> 06:07.068
* our place in time
beyond the sun *

06:07.133 --> 06:10.701
* we'll find our place in time *

06:10.767 --> 06:16.133
* our place in time
to call our own *

06:42.167 --> 06:43.534
Hello, mr. Ross.

06:43.601 --> 06:44.234
Did you have
a good flight?

06:44.301 --> 06:45.434
Yes. Thanks.

06:45.501 --> 06:47.067
Now, would you like me
to show you around,

06:47.134 --> 06:48.933
or do you want
to get some rest?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.100
Neither. Take me
to mr. Farrell.

06:51.167 --> 06:52.534
Yes, sir.
Right this way.

06:52.601 --> 06:53.967
They've
been waiting.

06:54.034 --> 06:55.167
Three days.

06:55.234 --> 06:56.734
Tell publicity
i'm not sure yet.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.401
They're saying
we're past our deadline.

06:58.467 --> 06:59.833
We have to release
this press statement.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.501
This is supposed to be coming
from me?

07:06.567 --> 07:08.301
I don't even understand
half of what it says.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.067
It doesn't sound
like me, lucy.

07:09.134 --> 07:10.734
So change it.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.933
You're the boss.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.301
Oh, and legal
needs signatures now,

07:13.367 --> 07:15.567
or no one gets paid,
including legal.

07:15.634 --> 07:17.367
I can only do one thing
at a time.

07:18.634 --> 07:19.701
So let's start

07:19.768 --> 07:21.100
with the statement.

07:21.167 --> 07:22.501
Why don't you dictate
something to me?

07:22.567 --> 07:24.167
No press statement.

07:24.234 --> 07:25.534
If the press wants to know

07:25.601 --> 07:26.534
what mr. Farrell
is thinking,

07:26.601 --> 07:28.434
<i>they can watch
60 minutes</i>

07:28.501 --> 07:29.800
along with the rest of america.

07:29.867 --> 07:32.301
I've already booked
an exclusive interview

07:32.367 --> 07:35.000
with our new face
of the 4400.

07:36.167 --> 07:37.567
That's all for now.

07:37.634 --> 07:39.334
Thanks.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.734
I'm sorry to just jump in
like that.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.867
I thought you could use a hand.

07:47.933 --> 07:48.933
Matthew ross.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.134
Yes.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.067
Yeah.

07:52.134 --> 07:54.000
What are you doing
in seattle?

07:54.067 --> 07:55.768
I go
where i'm needed.

07:55.833 --> 07:58.933
You've come
to the right place.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.401
It's no coincidence, shawn.

08:00.467 --> 08:02.867
Jordan made it clear
that, in the event of his death,

08:02.933 --> 08:04.367
i was to step up,
front and center,

08:04.434 --> 08:06.334
to help you out.

08:06.401 --> 08:07.768
Well, another in a long line
of plans

08:07.833 --> 08:08.768
that jordan neglected
to share with me.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.200
Huh.

08:10.267 --> 08:11.634
But i'm glad
you're here.

08:11.701 --> 08:13.067
Jordan talked about you a lot...

08:13.134 --> 08:14.601
you're going to need
to hire yourself a new lobbyist.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.534
I'm moving to the home office
for the time being.

08:16.601 --> 08:18.601
Pick any office you want.

08:18.668 --> 08:19.967
You start right away.

08:20.034 --> 08:20.967
Uh, these letters?

08:21.034 --> 08:22.134
Everyone knows i can heal now.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.701
Jordan had every intention

08:23.768 --> 08:24.933
of revealing
your healing ability

08:25.000 --> 08:26.267
to the public,

08:26.334 --> 08:27.534
but he was planning on doing it
in stages.

08:27.601 --> 08:29.367
We don't have
that luxury anymore.

08:29.434 --> 08:30.501
We'll deal with it.

08:30.567 --> 08:32.034
I can't go outside anymore.

08:32.100 --> 08:33.567
There's sick people.

08:33.634 --> 08:35.534
The press,
they follow me everywhere.

08:35.601 --> 08:37.267
And they will
for the rest of your life.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.967
The ground just shifted
under your feet.

08:40.034 --> 08:42.701
You either find your balance,
or you fall on your ass.

08:42.768 --> 08:45.800
This center
is the new lourdes.

08:45.867 --> 08:48.200
Nobody's going to be calling us
a "cult" anymore.

08:48.267 --> 08:51.301
We're turning away people
faster than we can sign them up.

08:51.367 --> 08:53.668
In 10 years,
this movement's going to be

08:53.734 --> 08:54.867
one of the dominant faiths
on the planet.

08:54.933 --> 08:55.867
Stop.

08:59.134 --> 09:01.668
I'm glad things are going
so well, i am,

09:01.734 --> 09:03.334
but a week ago,

09:03.401 --> 09:05.734
<i>i was just some guy trying
to beat the last level of doom.</i>

09:05.800 --> 09:09.034
I wasn't the pope then,
and i'm not the pope now.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.434
Yes, you are,

09:10.501 --> 09:12.567
and you need to start
getting used to it.

09:15.401 --> 09:17.267
The fbi is spearheading
the hunt for the man

09:17.334 --> 09:18.833
who killed jordan collier.

09:18.900 --> 09:21.601
Oh, but we're still in the game,
and NTAC is making this collar.

09:21.668 --> 09:24.634
I'm not having someone else
clean up our mess for us.

09:24.701 --> 09:26.401
Then we'd better get moving.

09:26.467 --> 09:27.933
We all know
there's an expiration date

09:28.000 --> 09:29.334
on these manhunts.

09:29.401 --> 09:30.701
Trail starts getting cold
after 48 hours.

09:30.768 --> 09:32.601
I want another look at employee
sign-in sheets

09:32.668 --> 09:34.301
for every office building
and parking garage

09:34.367 --> 09:36.034
within a 10-block radius
of the center.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.334
We've already cross-examined
everyone on those books.

09:38.401 --> 09:40.067
Then we have to look
off the books.

09:40.134 --> 09:42.701
This guy shot a public figure
in broad daylight.

09:42.768 --> 09:44.634
There has to be an eyewitness.

09:44.701 --> 09:47.301
And so far, tom, the only one
who has seen this killer

09:47.367 --> 09:49.567
is you.

09:54.401 --> 09:56.601
Loser.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.800
Pathetic loser.

10:01.867 --> 10:05.601
Sweetie, whatever you do,
never, ever gamble.

10:05.668 --> 10:08.367
It's wrong
and it's stupid.

10:08.434 --> 10:10.467
Then why do you do it?

10:10.534 --> 10:12.933
Because,
unlike your mommy,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.301
your aunt april doesn't
have a steady income.

10:15.367 --> 10:17.000
She's an artist,

10:17.067 --> 10:20.234
and artists
always need cash,

10:20.301 --> 10:21.734
which is where the "stupid" part
comes in,

10:21.800 --> 10:24.100
because i always lose.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.034
So this whole
"see the future" thing,

10:30.100 --> 10:33.067
it doesn't just apply
to earth-shattering events, huh?

10:33.134 --> 10:34.768
Not always.

10:34.833 --> 10:37.867
So, if i were to ask you
which card...

10:37.933 --> 10:39.234
that one.

10:39.301 --> 10:42.067
I'll take this one right here.

10:44.334 --> 10:46.067
Thanks.

10:54.034 --> 10:56.067
Baby girl...

10:56.134 --> 10:58.734
you are my new lucky charm.

11:00.867 --> 11:02.267
I'm pulling you off
the collier case.

11:02.334 --> 11:04.334
What are you
talking about?

11:04.401 --> 11:05.768
We still have half
that neighborhood to canvass.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.200
It's going to have to wait.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.334
At 10:37 a.m.,
pacific standard,

11:09.401 --> 11:11.668
the federal emergency
management agency

11:11.734 --> 11:13.467
sent in a task force

11:13.534 --> 11:15.134
to granite pass, oregon,
population 273,

11:15.200 --> 11:16.668
where there's been
an outbreak

11:16.734 --> 11:19.701
of a lethal, highly contagious,
and as yet unidentified virus.

11:19.768 --> 11:21.134
Airborne?

11:21.200 --> 11:22.267
Mm-hmm. Yeah, likely.

11:22.334 --> 11:23.267
Man-made?

11:23.334 --> 11:24.267
Unknown.

11:24.334 --> 11:25.768
What we do know is,

11:25.833 --> 11:27.367
if you went to sleep
in granite pass last night,

11:27.434 --> 11:28.601
chances are you're filling out
a body bag this morning.

11:28.668 --> 11:30.668
There's only
one resident

11:30.734 --> 11:32.501
that fema hasn't
accounted for yet.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.067
Jean delynn baker,
age 30.

11:34.134 --> 11:36.134
Returnee 0188.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.634
Disappeared in '99.

11:37.701 --> 11:38.734
Divorced. No kids.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.534
Psych profile says
she's a loner.

11:40.601 --> 11:41.701
Things have been
pretty grim for her

11:41.768 --> 11:42.967
since she got back.

11:43.034 --> 11:44.234
Hasn't been able
to hold down a job.

11:44.301 --> 11:45.301
She was unemployed
four times

11:45.367 --> 11:46.734
in the last year.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.200
And now she's the only resident
of granite pass, oregon

11:49.267 --> 11:50.401
who can't be
accounted for.

11:50.467 --> 11:51.601
So we've got two possibilities.

11:51.668 --> 11:52.867
Either she's immune
to this virus,

11:52.933 --> 11:54.534
in which case we could
study her,

11:54.601 --> 11:55.800
look for a cure.

11:55.867 --> 11:59.034
Or else...
she's the carrier.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.734
Either way,
your job is the same.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.000
Use whatever resources you need
and find her.

12:04.067 --> 12:06.800
[Country western playing
on radio]

12:06.867 --> 12:08.567
[Driver]: So, are you
going to tell me

12:08.634 --> 12:09.634
where you're headed?

12:13.668 --> 12:15.434
I never could
stand the sight

12:15.501 --> 12:17.301
of a woman in tears.

12:17.367 --> 12:20.067
I guess that's why
i never got married.

12:23.167 --> 12:25.634
You in some kind
of trouble?

12:25.701 --> 12:27.067
Run off
on your family?

12:27.134 --> 12:29.768
Law on your tail?

12:29.833 --> 12:30.967
Seattle.

12:31.034 --> 12:32.034
I'm going to seattle.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.034
That's a big city.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.200
You want me to just drop you
on the edge of town?

12:36.267 --> 12:39.000
I'm going to the 4400 center.

12:39.067 --> 12:40.200
I've got to get there.

12:40.267 --> 12:41.768
What the hell for?

12:41.833 --> 12:43.234
Are you joining up?

12:43.301 --> 12:45.434
Just get me as close
as you can.

12:45.501 --> 12:46.900
Please.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.434
If you're looking
for salvation,

12:49.501 --> 12:51.000
you're not going
to find it there.

12:51.067 --> 12:53.000
What you want to do

12:53.067 --> 12:55.200
is to give yourself
over...

12:55.267 --> 12:56.567
to your true lord
and savior.

12:56.634 --> 12:57.501
Purification day
is coming.

12:57.567 --> 12:58.967
Signs are everywhere...

12:59.034 --> 13:01.867
pestilence, plagues.

13:01.933 --> 13:03.467
Tell me about it.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.401
I woke up in a town
full of dead people

13:05.467 --> 13:06.434
this morning...

13:06.501 --> 13:08.567
my mother,
my father.

13:08.634 --> 13:09.701
Every...
everyone.

13:09.768 --> 13:11.601
Yeah?

13:11.668 --> 13:13.367
How come you survived?

13:13.434 --> 13:14.800
I think maybe i caused it.

13:14.867 --> 13:15.800
You?

13:17.401 --> 13:19.267
Now i know you're
messing with me.

13:19.334 --> 13:22.301
Okay, go ahead,
laugh at the jesus freak,

13:22.367 --> 13:24.301
but i'm telling you,

13:24.367 --> 13:26.301
the whole world'll be
wiped clean soon enough.

13:26.367 --> 13:28.000
Look, i don't think
you're a freak at all, mister.

13:28.067 --> 13:29.467
Matter of fact,

13:29.534 --> 13:34.819
i believe... everything you are saying

13:45.834 --> 13:48.967
The eyes and fingernails show
only slight discoloration.

13:49.034 --> 13:51.334
Rigor mortis
has barely set in.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.700
What did the autopsies show?

13:52.767 --> 13:54.400
Nothing we have a name for.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.001
Their internal
organisms

13:56.067 --> 13:57.067
are pretty much liquefied.

13:57.134 --> 13:58.533
This thing works fast.

13:58.600 --> 13:59.400
So you just took
your helmet off...

13:59.467 --> 14:00.767
you got a death wish?

14:00.834 --> 14:02.001
This virus gets released,
goes airborne,

14:02.067 --> 14:02.834
then dissipates
within a half-hour.

14:02.901 --> 14:04.634
Seen enough?

14:04.700 --> 14:06.301
Plenty.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.500
So everyone
we're looking at

14:11.567 --> 14:12.500
died this morning

14:12.567 --> 14:13.467
because
they were within

14:13.533 --> 14:14.834
the virus's
original radius?

14:14.901 --> 14:15.967
Yeah, and if they
drove through town

14:16.034 --> 14:17.101
an hour later,
they'd be fine.

14:17.167 --> 14:18.201
That's something,
anyway,

14:18.268 --> 14:19.368
but orson bailey,
trent appelbaum...

14:19.433 --> 14:21.167
when a 4400
manifests an ability,

14:21.234 --> 14:22.700
it can get more intense,
quickly.

14:22.767 --> 14:24.467
Which means that
if jean delynn baker

14:24.533 --> 14:26.101
is transmitting
the virus...

14:26.167 --> 14:28.867
yeah, she might be
just warming up.

14:34.301 --> 14:35.834
<i>the doctors say</i>

14:35.901 --> 14:37.167
<i>they cannot stop
my cancer from spreading.</i>

14:37.234 --> 14:39.400
<i>and i've worked
hard all my life,</i>

14:39.467 --> 14:41.134

14:51.067 --> 14:52.134
It's lucy.

14:52.201 --> 14:53.167
You're scheduled

14:53.234 --> 14:54.301
for the new keys
address.

14:54.368 --> 14:55.167
Everybody's waiting.

14:56.268 --> 14:58.368
Shawn?

15:01.167 --> 15:02.433
Yeah, i'm flattered.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.567
I'm just not sure

15:03.634 --> 15:05.400
i can take a job
right now.

15:05.467 --> 15:07.934
Richard's going to be
travelling quite a bit.

15:08.001 --> 15:11.134
The daycare here is first-rate
and completely free.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.268
Well, for one thing,
i'm not sure i'm qualified.

15:13.334 --> 15:15.934
I mean, assistant director
of human resources?

15:16.001 --> 15:19.034
I had my first daughter
right out of college.

15:19.101 --> 15:21.600
You could fit my entire resume
on half a page.

15:21.667 --> 15:23.034
You're a 4400.

15:23.101 --> 15:25.800
That's like an advanced
graduate degree around here.

15:25.867 --> 15:27.301
Besides,
jordan talked about you.

15:27.368 --> 15:28.634
Oh, i'm sure he did.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.533
He said you had
the gift of empathy,

15:30.600 --> 15:32.001
that you were
a natural born organizer,

15:32.067 --> 15:33.167
and that you had a knack

15:33.234 --> 15:35.101
for bringing out
the best in people.

15:35.167 --> 15:37.167
Jordan said that about me?

15:37.234 --> 15:38.667
You're a returnee.

15:38.734 --> 15:40.001
You're smart.

15:40.067 --> 15:41.901
We empower people like you
around here.

15:52.167 --> 15:53.600
Wipe your feet.

15:53.667 --> 15:56.167
A killer airborne virus
has been released,

15:56.234 --> 15:57.600
and you're worried
about muddy footprints?

15:57.667 --> 15:59.467
It's still
somebody's home.

15:59.533 --> 16:01.500
So this is where
jean delynn baker lived.

16:01.567 --> 16:02.934
Until she hit
the road, yeah.

16:03.001 --> 16:04.101
Does she keep a schedule?

16:04.167 --> 16:05.567
Any kind of daily planner?

16:05.634 --> 16:07.334
Yeah, but i think
it went out the window

16:07.400 --> 16:08.700
when she realized

16:08.767 --> 16:10.700
her entire hometown
had been wiped out.

16:10.767 --> 16:12.368
Anyone get in touch
with the parents?

16:12.433 --> 16:13.567
This
is their house.

16:13.634 --> 16:14.667
They were sleeping
upstairs

16:14.734 --> 16:16.268
when the virus hit.

16:16.334 --> 16:17.667
Okay, you guys
aren't leaving this house

16:17.734 --> 16:19.034
until you've been through
everything...

16:19.101 --> 16:20.500
letters, phone bills,
grocery lists.

16:20.567 --> 16:21.634
Marco, listen to me.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.368
Find me a pattern,
the way she thinks.

16:23.433 --> 16:24.634
She's on the run.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.034
I want to beat her
to wherever she's headed.

16:29.834 --> 16:31.700
Flirt.

16:31.767 --> 16:33.067
You heard the man.

16:33.134 --> 16:35.667
4400 center.
How may i direct your call?

16:35.734 --> 16:37.001
<i>I didn't mean
to do it.</i>

16:37.067 --> 16:39.201
I didn't mean to kill them.

16:39.268 --> 16:40.934
I...

16:41.001 --> 16:44.201
these... these blisters,
they itch so bad.

16:44.268 --> 16:45.433
Killed who?

16:45.500 --> 16:46.667
<i>I need you
to help me, please.</i>

16:46.734 --> 16:47.967
Who is this?

16:48.034 --> 16:49.400
I'm a 4400,

16:49.467 --> 16:50.834
and there's something wrong
with me.

16:50.901 --> 16:52.400
<i>Everybody
that i'm around dies,</i>

16:52.467 --> 16:53.500
<i>and i don't know
how to stop it.</i>

16:53.567 --> 16:54.967
<i>I don't know
how to stop it.</i>

16:55.034 --> 16:56.234
Tell me your name
and where you are.

16:56.301 --> 16:57.201
How many
people dead?

16:57.268 --> 16:58.368
She said hundreds,

16:58.467 --> 17:00.234
but there's nothing about it
on the news.

17:00.301 --> 17:01.901
Could be
they're trying to keep it quiet,

17:01.967 --> 17:03.934
and there is a 4400
named jean baker?

17:04.001 --> 17:05.567
She said
she's staying

17:05.634 --> 17:06.767
at a motel near
the squirrel hill exit

17:06.834 --> 17:07.867
on the 65.

17:07.934 --> 17:09.233
Get me NTAC on the phone.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.532
Yes!

17:17.599 --> 17:19.334
You were right.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.300
Philadelphia creamed 'em.

17:21.367 --> 17:22.666
How much
did you win?

17:22.733 --> 17:25.166
$200 for aunt april.

17:25.233 --> 17:29.001
All because of you,
my little genius.

17:29.067 --> 17:32.467
Now, i'm looking
at chicago versus new york,

17:32.533 --> 17:34.101
even up.

17:34.167 --> 17:36.567
Chicago's the home team,
which gives them some advantage,

17:36.634 --> 17:37.700
but new york
is coming off

17:37.767 --> 17:39.400
a three-game
winning streak.

17:39.467 --> 17:41.234
So, who's your pick?

17:41.301 --> 17:43.001
How much are you betting?

17:43.067 --> 17:44.667
The whole
200 bucks,

17:44.734 --> 17:47.101
which won't win me
enough to retire on,

17:47.167 --> 17:48.700
but a girl's got
to start somewhere.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.700
So, you getting
anything?

17:53.467 --> 17:54.967
Do you like me?

17:56.134 --> 17:58.400
What kind of question is that?

17:58.467 --> 17:59.667
I mean,

17:59.734 --> 18:02.567
like me for myself...

18:02.634 --> 18:05.101
or because i tell you stuff
that's going to happen?

18:06.834 --> 18:08.867
Honey, listen.

18:08.934 --> 18:11.134
I love you
for who you are,

18:11.201 --> 18:13.634
not what you can do.

18:13.700 --> 18:15.101
Always.

18:15.167 --> 18:17.201
Okay?

18:19.001 --> 18:20.600
I'd go with chicago.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.700
Chicago it is.

18:24.834 --> 18:26.301
Now, come on.

18:26.368 --> 18:28.700
Aunt april is going
to take you out for pizza.

18:28.767 --> 18:30.067
Go wash up,

18:30.134 --> 18:31.433
and take your mom's stuff off.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.167
You know she gets
kind of uptight about...

18:34.234 --> 18:36.634
Maia.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.201
This is my mother's
engagement ring.

18:38.268 --> 18:39.368
Where did you get this?

18:39.433 --> 18:41.268
I always play with it.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.301
This is a very valuable ring,

18:45.368 --> 18:46.334
which means

18:46.400 --> 18:48.067
it is not
for little girls

18:48.134 --> 18:49.334
to play with.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.134
Now wash good,
or i'll order anchovies.

18:52.201 --> 18:53.667
Go!

19:04.834 --> 19:06.034
Hey.

19:06.101 --> 19:07.600
Hey.

19:07.667 --> 19:10.667
Don't take this the wrong way,
but how'd you get in here?

19:10.734 --> 19:12.667
Your dad gave me a key.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.500
A little early
for dinner, isn't it?

19:14.567 --> 19:17.934
Early for eating.
Not for preparing.

19:19.234 --> 19:20.301
Can you cook?

19:20.368 --> 19:22.334
Sorry, i'm a world-class
brain surgeon,

19:22.400 --> 19:23.734
not a chef.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.001
But i can empty
a grocery bag

19:25.067 --> 19:26.867
with the best
of them, though.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.500
But i have
to warn you,

19:29.567 --> 19:30.634
you're ignoring

19:30.700 --> 19:31.634
the number-one
"rule of dad."

19:31.700 --> 19:33.234
Which is?

19:33.301 --> 19:36.134
The longer and more carefully
you prepare for a family event...

19:36.201 --> 19:37.700
the more likely it is
he won't show.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.268
I guess you do know the man.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.268
Which means i guess
you also know me,

19:44.334 --> 19:45.901
which, i'm sorry,
is really weird.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.101
You have to admit

19:47.167 --> 19:48.634
it's a little strange
for me, too.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.034
We have an eight-year
relationship,

19:50.101 --> 19:51.500
and i have to
keep reminding myself

19:51.567 --> 19:54.667
that it doesn't really exist.

19:56.034 --> 19:57.368
So tell me,

19:57.433 --> 19:59.500
was i, like, number one
in my class in medical school?

19:59.567 --> 20:01.167
What does it matter, kyle?

20:01.234 --> 20:03.967
You're not in competition
with yourself.

20:04.034 --> 20:05.167
I'm just curious.

20:05.234 --> 20:06.400
Well, you keep bringing it up.

20:06.467 --> 20:08.901
It's more than curiosity.

20:08.967 --> 20:10.201
So what if it is?

20:10.268 --> 20:11.867
If you knew there was
some parallel universe

20:11.934 --> 20:14.034
where a better, smarter version
of you was walking around,

20:14.101 --> 20:15.433
how would you feel?

20:15.500 --> 20:17.301
He wasn't better,
and he wasn't smarter.

20:17.368 --> 20:18.767
He was you.

20:18.834 --> 20:20.268
He just had options
i'll never have.

20:20.334 --> 20:22.567
No 4400,
no coma.

20:22.634 --> 20:24.201
He got to go to medical school.

20:24.268 --> 20:26.268
Who says
you don't have that option?

20:26.334 --> 20:27.467
I'm 21.
I'm a freshman in college.

20:27.533 --> 20:28.967
So you started a little late.

20:29.034 --> 20:30.567
You keep thinking
i know two kyles.

20:30.634 --> 20:32.901
I don't. I just know you.

20:32.967 --> 20:34.467
You want
to be a doctor?

20:34.533 --> 20:38.368
I know for a fact
that you can pass your mcats.

20:41.034 --> 20:43.767
Jean baker's in a motel

20:43.834 --> 20:45.533
about 10 miles ahead.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.500
Right now, half of NTAC
is headed for that place.

20:47.567 --> 20:48.901
Mortimer and falcone
should be there already.

20:48.967 --> 20:50.067
It's weird, huh?

20:50.134 --> 20:51.201
Responding to a tip

20:51.268 --> 20:53.368
that came from inside
the 4400 center?

20:53.433 --> 20:54.800
Shawn did tell me

20:54.867 --> 20:56.268
he wanted
to cooperate with us.

20:56.334 --> 20:57.700
I guess he meant it.

21:11.834 --> 21:13.500
Excuse me. We're NTAC.

21:13.567 --> 21:14.700
We need to get through here.

21:14.767 --> 21:16.533
I'll open it for you.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.834
So what's going on
down there?

21:17.901 --> 21:19.067
Dead trucker.

21:19.134 --> 21:21.368
Looks like
it came on sudden.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.767
Jean delynn baker?

21:57.834 --> 21:59.001
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

21:59.067 --> 22:00.101
I called you for help.

22:00.167 --> 22:01.034
We know.
Come with us.

22:01.101 --> 22:02.334
No, you're scaring me.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.700
Please, stop.

22:03.767 --> 22:05.867
They start to itch
when i get scared.

22:05.934 --> 22:07.967
Please, get away from me!

22:09.533 --> 22:11.533
Oh, god.

22:41.300 --> 22:42.400
That trucker died

22:42.467 --> 22:44.033
not more than
three hours ago.

22:44.100 --> 22:45.200
Yeah, and he couldn't
have picked up jean

22:45.267 --> 22:46.334
more than two hours
before that.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.667
Which means
he was exposed, infected,

22:47.734 --> 22:50.000
and killed within,
what, 120 minutes.

22:50.067 --> 22:51.234
That's faster

22:51.300 --> 22:53.300
than any virus
i've ever seen.

22:54.934 --> 22:56.334
Mortimer and falcone.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.567
Looks like
we're playing backup.

22:57.634 --> 22:58.634
Baldwin.

22:58.701 --> 22:59.801
<i>[Jean]: it's not my fault.</i>

22:59.868 --> 23:01.801
Who is this?

23:01.868 --> 23:03.067
<i>I called you for help.</i>

23:03.133 --> 23:06.067
You tossed tear gas
into my room!

23:06.133 --> 23:07.400
Jean baker?

23:07.467 --> 23:09.100
How did you get
mortimer's phone?

23:09.167 --> 23:11.400
<i>How do you think i got it?</i>

23:11.467 --> 23:13.567
They scared me.

23:13.634 --> 23:16.334
They... they came barging in
to my room.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.968
What did you do
to them?

23:18.033 --> 23:20.267
<i>I guess you thought
those suits they had on</i>

23:20.334 --> 23:21.400
<i>would keep them safe, huh?</i>

23:21.467 --> 23:23.434
<i>Well, you were wrong, okay?</i>

23:23.501 --> 23:24.634
Nobody's safe.

23:24.701 --> 23:26.033
That's why i'm warning you.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.868
You stay away from me, okay.

23:28.934 --> 23:30.934
Just keep everyone away.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.734
<i>Where are you?
I'm driving.</i>

23:32.801 --> 23:34.000
I think
she took their car.

23:34.067 --> 23:35.534
Call jarvis.
Get a bead on it.

23:35.601 --> 23:36.767
Jean, tell me
where you are,

23:36.834 --> 23:37.767
where you're going.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.033
We want to help you.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.067
<i>No. I tried that.</i>

23:40.133 --> 23:41.267
No one can help me.

23:41.334 --> 23:42.667
No one ever could.

23:42.734 --> 23:44.200
Why should it be
any different now?

23:44.267 --> 23:46.267
I know you don't want
to kill anyone,

23:46.334 --> 23:47.534
but listen to me,

23:47.601 --> 23:49.100
this virus that's
growing inside you,

23:49.167 --> 23:50.534
it's incredibly lethal.

23:50.601 --> 23:51.934
I've always been toxic.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.901
I poisoned every relationship
i ever had.

23:53.968 --> 23:55.801
This is different.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.767
Yes, they made it real.

23:57.834 --> 24:01.601
<i>My parents always said
i was a walking disaster.</i>

24:01.667 --> 24:03.734
They never got to see
how right they were.

24:03.801 --> 24:05.934
<i>Jean, it doesn't have
to be like that.</i>

24:06.000 --> 24:07.067
If you want this
to be over,

24:07.133 --> 24:08.300
it can be.

24:08.367 --> 24:09.767
Just find a deserted
spot, pull over,

24:09.834 --> 24:11.067
and wait for us
to come to you.

24:11.133 --> 24:12.133
<i>I don't need you.</i>

24:12.200 --> 24:14.334
I'm taking care of it myself.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.834
What are you
going to do?

24:15.901 --> 24:18.801
I'm going to end this
before i kill anyone else.

24:18.868 --> 24:20.200
End what?

24:20.267 --> 24:22.667
This phone call, this day,
everything.

24:22.734 --> 24:24.567
No, jean, just wait.
Hold on. Listen to me.

24:24.634 --> 24:26.300
Goodbye, baldwin.

24:29.334 --> 24:31.467
She says she's going
to kill herself.

24:31.534 --> 24:33.033
Well, i'm not sure
that's a solution.

24:33.100 --> 24:34.400
It could trigger
another release of the virus.

24:34.467 --> 24:35.801
Do we have a fix on her?

24:35.868 --> 24:37.334
Yeah, she's driving west
on the 99.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.868
Jarvis has got three
helicopters in the air.

24:38.934 --> 24:40.267
If she doesn't pull over,

24:40.334 --> 24:41.734
there's orders
to incinerate.

24:43.834 --> 24:45.133
Vacation?

24:45.200 --> 24:46.501
For how long?

24:46.567 --> 24:48.033
A month, maybe two.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.334
I don't know.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.968
You think that's what
the center, the movement,

24:51.033 --> 24:52.067
needs right now?

24:52.133 --> 24:53.133
I don't know, matthew,

24:53.200 --> 24:54.133
but i'm damn sure

24:54.200 --> 24:55.634
it's what i need
right now.

24:55.701 --> 24:57.167
I think you're going
to have to settle

24:57.234 --> 24:58.634
for a long weekend.

24:58.701 --> 25:00.133
I hear puget sound
is nice.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.334
Okay, you're not hearing me.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.534
I'm ignoring you.

25:02.601 --> 25:03.701
There's a difference.

25:05.801 --> 25:07.300
Listen.

25:07.367 --> 25:09.133
I'm not saying
i can't do this.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.801
I will lead this movement.

25:12.868 --> 25:14.567
But jordan just died,

25:14.634 --> 25:17.334
and i need some time
to get my head around that.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.834
You're going to have to grieve
on the run

25:18.901 --> 25:20.033
like the rest of us.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.701
It's called being a grownup.

25:21.767 --> 25:24.167
Don't lecture me
about my responsibilities.

25:26.067 --> 25:28.067
You just got here,

25:28.133 --> 25:29.701
and if this place needs me

25:29.767 --> 25:32.300
the way that you keep
saying that it does,

25:32.367 --> 25:34.667
then it's going to have
to work around me sometimes.

25:34.734 --> 25:35.934
Work around you?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.133
We can do that.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.534
Mary o'connell.

25:38.601 --> 25:40.067
Taken 1972.

25:40.133 --> 25:41.534
Very promising empath.

25:41.601 --> 25:43.934
Robert fields,
1987.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.267
Genius with numbers
and pattern recognition.

25:46.334 --> 25:47.434
John gersten...

25:47.501 --> 25:48.701
who are these people?

25:48.767 --> 25:50.267
Replacements, potentially.

25:51.901 --> 25:53.267
None of them make
the slam dunk you would,

25:53.334 --> 25:55.000
but i'm ready
to move this center forward,

25:55.067 --> 25:56.133
with you or otherwise.

26:04.033 --> 26:06.033
Jordan used to talk to me
that way sometimes.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.667
He was great at getting me
to see things his way.

26:09.868 --> 26:11.834
You?

26:11.901 --> 26:13.767
You're not quite there yet.

26:15.567 --> 26:18.634
Your healing power
makes you unique.

26:18.701 --> 26:20.501
Jordan knew it.

26:20.567 --> 26:21.968
I believed it.

26:22.033 --> 26:23.901
I came here to work with you,

26:23.968 --> 26:26.567
but you're asking me
to work around you,

26:26.634 --> 26:28.300
and that i can't do.

26:28.367 --> 26:29.567
Then you are going
to have to spend

26:29.634 --> 26:32.367
some quality time
with that list,

26:32.434 --> 26:33.934
because i'm leaving.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.200
I'm sure you won't
miss a beat, though.

26:36.267 --> 26:41.000
I know there's a huge demand
for pattern recognition.

26:47.634 --> 26:48.868
Th-th-that's impossible.

26:48.934 --> 26:50.434
Mortimer and falcone
were wearing

26:50.501 --> 26:52.367
state-of-the-art
biohazard gear.

26:52.434 --> 26:54.968
That stuff's engineered
to withstand an anthrax attack.

26:55.033 --> 26:56.667
They're dead, marco.

26:56.734 --> 26:58.200
Obviously, whatever
she's releasing

26:58.267 --> 27:00.400
is a little craftier
than the anthrax virus.

27:00.467 --> 27:02.033
If it got through those suits,

27:02.100 --> 27:03.934
that means the antigen's
operating on a subatomic level.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.934
Which basically
makes it unstoppable.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.234
<i>Yeah, pretty much.</i>

27:07.300 --> 27:08.734
Jean told me mortimer
and falcone scared her

27:08.801 --> 27:09.901
when they came
into her room.

27:09.968 --> 27:11.801
Is it possible
the release of this virus

27:11.868 --> 27:13.300
is connected
to her emotional state?

27:13.367 --> 27:15.767
Yeah, more than possible,
it's likely.

27:15.834 --> 27:19.000
Her medicine cabinet
is basically a neon sign

27:19.067 --> 27:21.100
flashing "borderline
personality disorder."

27:21.167 --> 27:24.934
<i>She's got cortisone creams
for stress rashes,</i>

27:25.000 --> 27:26.133
<i>an assortment</i>

27:26.200 --> 27:28.067
of your finer
psychopharmaceuticals...

27:28.133 --> 27:29.667
xanax, prozac...

27:29.734 --> 27:30.901
<i>yeah,
we get it, marco.</i>

27:30.968 --> 27:32.334
<i>She's a wreck.</i>

27:32.400 --> 27:35.234
A wreck whose body acts
as a delivery system

27:35.300 --> 27:36.767
for the virus she's producing...

27:36.834 --> 27:39.033
the same way
flowers release pollen.

27:39.100 --> 27:40.701
What, she's emitting
spores?

27:40.767 --> 27:42.601
<i>Something like that.</i>

27:42.667 --> 27:44.100
<i>Look, spores are just</i>

27:44.167 --> 27:46.467
reproductive bodies
released by a vascular system.

27:46.534 --> 27:49.033
The human body
is one big vascular system.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.701
It runs on blood flow.

27:50.767 --> 27:52.100
Yeah, which can
speed up or slow down,

27:52.167 --> 27:54.434
depending on moods,
feelings.

27:54.501 --> 27:56.133
Right, so when jean's blood
gets going...

27:56.200 --> 28:00.667
when she's angry,
confused, upset, whatever...

28:00.734 --> 28:02.367
a killer virus goes airborne.

28:05.234 --> 28:08.334
We're not far
from her car now, marco.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.200
Any advice on how
to deal with her?

28:11.567 --> 28:14.033
Uh... don't piss her off?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.400
Hey.

28:24.467 --> 28:26.067
Hi.
How are you, lily?

28:26.133 --> 28:28.167
Good.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.968
I heard, um,
you're leaving for a while.

28:33.901 --> 28:35.934
That was fast.

28:38.200 --> 28:41.434
Anyway, yeah, i don't know
how long i'm going to be gone.

28:41.501 --> 28:43.834
What are you going to do?

28:43.901 --> 28:45.834
For starters, i'm going to
disappear for a while,

28:45.901 --> 28:49.000
and then, um, i don't know,
who knows?

28:49.067 --> 28:50.634
I mean, i don't have
to work here

28:50.701 --> 28:52.167
to make people healthy,

28:52.234 --> 28:54.300
so i guess i could go anywhere.

28:54.367 --> 28:56.767
So you're just
going to kind of roam the earth,

28:56.834 --> 28:58.234
kung fu style?

28:58.300 --> 29:00.167
I'm not going to shave my head
and wear a robe,

29:00.234 --> 29:02.334
but... something like that,
i guess.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.501
Well, you could take these
with you,

29:04.567 --> 29:05.834
check out
the return address...

29:05.901 --> 29:07.200
stop off

29:07.267 --> 29:08.934
in gloucester, massachusetts,

29:09.000 --> 29:09.968
do a quick healing,

29:10.033 --> 29:11.200
and then go on your way.

29:11.267 --> 29:13.133
You know about the letters?

29:13.200 --> 29:15.267
Oh, shawn,
they're everywhere.

29:15.334 --> 29:17.434
Yeah, each one sadder
than the next.

29:17.501 --> 29:19.634
It's too much to take, almost.

29:20.634 --> 29:23.901
It did give me
an idea, though,

29:23.968 --> 29:25.667
but, you know, you're leaving,

29:25.734 --> 29:27.968
so we'll talk it over
when you get back.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.567
No, lily, i mean...

29:29.634 --> 29:32.467
like i said, i don't know when
that's going to be, so, please,

29:32.534 --> 29:35.400
i would love to hear
what you have to say.

29:35.467 --> 29:37.133
All right, well,

29:37.200 --> 29:38.567
i was thinking...

29:38.634 --> 29:42.033
i mean, we're not
a hospital,

29:42.100 --> 29:43.167
and we're not
a charity,

29:43.234 --> 29:45.300
and still, thousands
of these requests

29:45.367 --> 29:47.434
keep pouring in
every day.

29:47.501 --> 29:49.067
I mean, no wonder
you feel overwhelmed.

29:49.133 --> 29:50.467
We're not set up
to handle it.

29:50.534 --> 29:51.801
Yes, exactly.

29:51.868 --> 29:54.501
That's why
i've got to get out of here.

29:54.567 --> 29:57.601
What if we set up a foundation?

29:57.667 --> 29:59.300
Part of this place,
but separate.

29:59.367 --> 30:01.133
Hire a staff
whose only job

30:01.200 --> 30:02.767
is to open
these letters

30:02.834 --> 30:05.000
and find the neediest cases,

30:05.067 --> 30:07.834
people that we can help
that no one else can.

30:07.901 --> 30:11.267
But that is still saying no
to thousands of people.

30:11.334 --> 30:13.100
Well, that's right, shawn,

30:13.167 --> 30:16.567
but what if we can say yes
to one?

30:16.634 --> 30:19.367
I mean, you heal
one person a day,

30:19.434 --> 30:21.767
every day.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.467
That's a big job, though...

30:31.534 --> 30:33.167
deciding who deserves it most.

30:33.234 --> 30:35.000
Well, so you form a committee,

30:35.067 --> 30:39.033
and you load it up
with doctors and social workers.

30:39.100 --> 30:40.100
And you.

30:40.167 --> 30:41.400
Oh. Well...

30:41.467 --> 30:43.033
come on, i mean,
it's your idea.

30:43.100 --> 30:45.801
You should at least be there
to help make it happen.

30:45.868 --> 30:47.334
Yeah, i just took a job
at human resources.

30:47.400 --> 30:49.834
I think i could probably
get you transferred.

31:03.234 --> 31:04.801
Did you find a body
in there?

31:04.868 --> 31:06.234
Can't get
close enough yet.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.934
As soon as you can,
we need to retrieve it.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.033
Well, she said
she wanted to end it.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.767
I guess we could send
marco and his boys

31:13.834 --> 31:14.901
back down
to the basement,

31:14.968 --> 31:16.267
let 'em find
a ripple effect

31:16.334 --> 31:17.267
on this one.

31:18.334 --> 31:19.467
Excuse me.

31:19.534 --> 31:21.300
Baldwin.

31:21.367 --> 31:23.634
<i>I came close,
but i don't know...</i>

31:23.701 --> 31:24.734
jean?

31:24.801 --> 31:26.601
I couldn't go through with it.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.267
That's good.
Nobody wants you dead.

31:28.334 --> 31:29.868
Just tell me where you are.

31:29.934 --> 31:31.234
<i>No. You can't
help me.</i>

31:31.300 --> 31:34.501
The 4400 center can't help me,
but it doesn't matter.

31:34.567 --> 31:36.567
I finally know
where i'm supposed to go.

31:36.634 --> 31:37.801
Tell me where.

31:37.868 --> 31:39.167
I'll meet you
there.

31:39.234 --> 31:40.667
<i>You ever read
the bible, baldwin?</i>

31:40.734 --> 31:42.467
I went to sunday school.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.501
<i>I spent some time
with it earlier today,</i>

31:44.567 --> 31:46.067
<i>back at that motel.</i>

31:46.133 --> 31:47.567
"The time is at hand."

31:47.634 --> 31:48.734
That's "revelations," right?

31:48.801 --> 31:49.934
<i>But do you know
what it means?</i>

31:50.000 --> 31:51.033
<i>I bet you don't.</i>

31:51.100 --> 31:54.868
See, these blisters...

31:54.934 --> 31:58.634
they form on my hands.

31:59.901 --> 32:01.234
Do you get it?

32:01.300 --> 32:02.667
I'm not sure i do, jean.

32:02.734 --> 32:05.167
<i>They're talking
about me in that book.</i>

32:08.834 --> 32:10.400
You got family?

32:10.467 --> 32:11.834
Jean, what are you
talking about?

32:11.901 --> 32:12.934
<i>Go to them.</i>

32:13.000 --> 32:15.634
Hug them real tight.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.100
<i>I've finally
figured it out,</i>

32:17.167 --> 32:18.434
<i>why they
sent me back.</i>

32:18.501 --> 32:20.701
I'm part of their plan.

32:20.767 --> 32:22.400
They want me to do this.

32:22.467 --> 32:24.634
Do what?

32:25.667 --> 32:28.534
Purify humanity.

32:36.401 --> 32:38.000
She was quoting "revelations?"

32:38.067 --> 32:39.767
Never a good sign, tom.

32:39.834 --> 32:41.334
She's gone
from wanting to help,

32:41.401 --> 32:42.501
wanting to stop
all of this,

32:42.568 --> 32:44.167
to believing she's
the end of the world,

32:44.234 --> 32:45.434
so what does she do?

32:45.501 --> 32:48.101
She said they want her
to do this, right?

32:48.167 --> 32:50.501
Well, that implies
it's out of her hands.

32:50.568 --> 32:52.700
Destiny.

32:52.767 --> 32:54.767
She's giving up
responsibility.

32:54.834 --> 32:56.134
Yeah, that's one way

32:56.201 --> 32:57.568
to deal with being
a walking plague...

32:57.633 --> 32:58.700
pretend the decision's
out of your hands.

32:58.767 --> 32:59.834
I don't think
she wants to even

32:59.900 --> 33:00.867
think about it
anymore.

33:00.934 --> 33:02.267
I think she just
wants it over.

33:02.334 --> 33:03.468
Well,
that's her mindset.

33:03.534 --> 33:04.934
It still doesn't tell us
where she's going.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.301
She's on
autopilot, tom.

33:06.367 --> 33:08.067
My best guess?

33:08.134 --> 33:10.334
She does whatever
she planned on doing

33:10.401 --> 33:12.201
before the bodies
started rolling.

33:12.267 --> 33:13.967
Right.
[Cellphone ringing]

33:14.034 --> 33:15.334
Marco.

33:15.401 --> 33:16.667
Today's tuesday, right?

33:16.733 --> 33:18.667
<i>It's wednesday,
marco.</i>

33:18.733 --> 33:20.401
My bad.

33:20.468 --> 33:23.234
She's only got one thing
written down for the day.

33:23.301 --> 33:25.000
She's filing
her unemployment claim

33:25.067 --> 33:27.267
in downtown portland.

33:28.401 --> 33:29.534
Son of a bitch!

33:29.600 --> 33:31.134
I don't believe it.

33:31.201 --> 33:32.468
Am i dreaming,

33:32.534 --> 33:35.900
or did you not tell me
that chicago would win?

33:38.134 --> 33:39.468
Do you know
what i bet?

33:39.534 --> 33:41.468
$200.

33:41.534 --> 33:44.434
Try my mother's
diamond engagement ring,

33:44.501 --> 33:47.134
and now it's gone,

33:47.201 --> 33:50.867
all because i believed in you,
trusted you,

33:50.934 --> 33:53.201
and you let me down.

33:53.267 --> 33:54.434
You lied to me.

33:54.501 --> 33:56.367
You said winning
didn't matter.

33:56.434 --> 33:59.267
You said you liked me anyway.

34:00.667 --> 34:04.167
Oh, so you knew chicago
would lose, didn't you?

34:04.234 --> 34:06.367
Right from the jump,

34:06.434 --> 34:08.000
this was all just a test.

34:18.501 --> 34:19.568
A foundation?

34:19.632 --> 34:20.934
Don't you think

34:21.000 --> 34:22.434
we have our hands
full already?

34:22.501 --> 34:23.467
It's one person a day.

34:23.534 --> 34:25.101
Once it's up
and running,

34:25.167 --> 34:26.234
it's not really going
to eat into my time.

34:26.301 --> 34:28.101
I thought you were
looking for privacy.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.301
You do this,

34:29.367 --> 34:31.034
you're stepping into
a white-hot spotlight.

34:31.101 --> 34:32.400
Yes, but it's
on my terms.

34:32.467 --> 34:34.667
Be good publicity.

34:34.733 --> 34:36.568
Not too hard
to get off the ground.

34:36.632 --> 34:38.067
We could get
some huge names

34:38.134 --> 34:39.667
for that
filtering committee.

34:39.733 --> 34:41.632
I think
it's a good idea.

34:41.699 --> 34:43.600
Well, i'm glad
that you approve,

34:43.667 --> 34:46.467
but i wasn't really asking
for your permission.

34:48.568 --> 34:51.134
I would hope not.

35:23.301 --> 35:25.367
Jean.

35:28.900 --> 35:30.534
Baldwin?

35:31.900 --> 35:32.934
That's right.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.067
You should've stayed away.

35:35.134 --> 35:37.800
Look around you.

35:37.867 --> 35:39.967
All these people, they haven't
done anything to hurt you.

35:40.034 --> 35:42.401
They haven't done anything
to help me, either.

35:42.468 --> 35:44.267
Besides,
it doesn't matter.

35:44.334 --> 35:46.468
I don't have a choice.

35:46.534 --> 35:48.034
I am doing
what they wanted me to do.

35:48.101 --> 35:49.101
You don't have
to accept that.

35:49.167 --> 35:50.633
You have a choice.

35:50.700 --> 35:52.834
Yeah, like i had a choice
when i was abducted.

35:54.867 --> 35:56.501
I never had a choice.

35:56.568 --> 35:57.700
Ever.

35:59.201 --> 36:01.000
They have

36:01.067 --> 36:02.301
the right girl
for the job.

36:02.367 --> 36:03.201
What are you doing
here, anyway?

36:03.267 --> 36:04.367
You should have gone

36:04.434 --> 36:05.800
back to your family,
like i said.

36:05.867 --> 36:08.334
No. I'm right where
i want to be.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.134
Then you must have
some kind of death wish.

36:12.201 --> 36:13.301
You think you're here
to kill people.

36:13.367 --> 36:15.000
I think i'm here to stop you.

36:15.067 --> 36:16.900
They infected you, jean,
and that was wrong,

36:16.967 --> 36:19.501
but you don't have to let them
make you into a mass murderer.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.733
I'm already a killer.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.167
No. No.

36:23.234 --> 36:24.568
You haven't decided
to kill anyone.

36:24.633 --> 36:25.534
That's what you're doing
right now.

36:26.534 --> 36:28.800
Whatever
you're thinking

36:28.867 --> 36:30.667
about destiny or fate,
whatever...

36:30.733 --> 36:32.201
you're wrong.

36:32.267 --> 36:35.134
You don't have to do this.

36:35.201 --> 36:37.301
You don't.

36:37.367 --> 36:40.800
Want to hear
something funny?

36:40.867 --> 36:43.934
I... i believe you.

36:46.434 --> 36:49.267
But it's too late.

36:49.334 --> 36:52.167
Oh...
they're so ripe.

36:52.234 --> 36:54.700
I can't stop it now.

36:54.767 --> 36:58.267
They itch so bad.

36:58.334 --> 36:59.834
They do.

37:39.501 --> 37:40.568
Hell of a day.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.201
How are you holding up?

37:42.267 --> 37:43.468
Well...

37:43.534 --> 37:45.000
i'm scheduled

37:45.067 --> 37:46.733
for psychiatric
counseling on monday.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.967
Saved thousands
of innocent people,

37:49.034 --> 37:52.134
had to shoot a woman
to do it...

37:52.201 --> 37:53.967
you did what you had to do.

37:55.134 --> 37:57.201
Anyway, uh,

37:57.267 --> 37:58.900
not sure if this
is a good time,

37:58.967 --> 38:02.000
but i made you
a little something.

38:02.067 --> 38:04.267
It's kind of a...

38:04.334 --> 38:05.900
well, a fake version
of Maia's diary.

38:05.967 --> 38:07.334
Should fool
just about anybody.

38:07.401 --> 38:10.134
You forged this
to get NTAC off my back?

38:10.201 --> 38:12.633
I know
it's a big thing,

38:12.700 --> 38:15.401
but you were kind of
over a barrel, so...

38:15.468 --> 38:17.700
this could get me
into a lot of trouble.

38:17.767 --> 38:20.767
This could get you
in a lot of trouble.

38:20.834 --> 38:21.934
Yeah, uh...

38:22.000 --> 38:23.201
you don't
have to use it

38:23.267 --> 38:24.434
if you don't want to.

38:24.501 --> 38:25.733
Just giving you
an option.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.334
This is insane.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.367
It's also maybe one
of the nicest things

38:32.434 --> 38:35.534
anybody's ever done
for me.

38:38.234 --> 38:40.633
I want to thank you
for a job well done.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.434
You must have been
very persuasive.

38:42.501 --> 38:44.000
I just said what i thought.

38:44.067 --> 38:46.800
Your idea for a foundation
was terrific.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.700
You mean your idea, don't you?

38:48.767 --> 38:49.733
Do we have to be

38:49.800 --> 38:51.067
all cloak-and-dagger
about it?

38:51.134 --> 38:52.134
You and shawn

38:52.201 --> 38:53.600
both got what you wanted,

38:53.667 --> 38:55.134
and a lot of sick people
are going to get help.

38:55.201 --> 38:57.468
Well, you did a lot of good
for the center today,

38:57.534 --> 38:59.700
and i'm not going to forget it.

39:01.134 --> 39:02.800
Hey, matthew,

39:02.867 --> 39:04.568
you know what the center
means to me?

39:04.633 --> 39:05.967
What?

39:06.034 --> 39:07.568
Free rent and daycare
for my daughter.

39:07.633 --> 39:10.501
I'm not
an 18-year-old kid.

39:10.568 --> 39:12.800
I don't need to discover
the magic power inside of me.

39:12.867 --> 39:16.334
So, in other words...

39:16.401 --> 39:18.600
you're not a true believer?

39:19.733 --> 39:21.934
Is that a problem?

39:23.301 --> 39:24.733
Not at all.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.934
Neither am i.

39:44.667 --> 39:46.000
You look wiped.

39:46.067 --> 39:47.267
Yeah. Don't ask.

39:47.334 --> 39:48.934
You didn't
have to do this.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.334
Well, i didn't.

39:50.401 --> 39:51.700
Your son's the cook.

39:51.767 --> 39:53.167
Kyle?

39:53.234 --> 39:54.867
I bet he had
a little help.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.900
Well, you know,
we got to talking.

39:56.967 --> 39:59.000
It was nice.

40:00.134 --> 40:02.468
How was your day, alana?

40:02.534 --> 40:05.101
Well, i bought
these pieces

40:05.167 --> 40:08.201
from this young artist,
this girl from bed-stuy,

40:08.267 --> 40:09.367
self-taught,

40:09.434 --> 40:10.468
and she painted

40:10.534 --> 40:11.967
this little
scrap of garden

40:12.034 --> 40:13.468
in her backyard,

40:13.534 --> 40:14.934
and it's night,

40:15.000 --> 40:18.501
and the sky
is so rich and deep...

40:31.501 --> 40:32.900
You okay?

40:32.967 --> 40:34.468
More or less.

40:34.534 --> 40:36.000
Bet you almost forgot.

40:37.267 --> 40:39.000
No, i didn't,

40:39.067 --> 40:40.534
but i thought,
in light of today's events,

40:40.600 --> 40:42.101
i would give you
a little extension.

40:42.167 --> 40:43.967
Well, it's not necessary.

40:44.034 --> 40:45.534
It's a hot read.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.067
Lots of good stuff
about spongebob.

40:49.401 --> 40:50.900
Thank you.
