00:01.240 --> 00:03.846
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.920 --> 00:06.366
I know that Agent Coulson
was killed in action.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.851
Welcome to Level 7.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.684
Some say
it was only for eight seconds,

00:09.760 --> 00:11.046
but I feel different.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.246
What is Centipede?

00:12.320 --> 00:14.084
It's an intravenous
filter for his blood.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.680
Very similar to the serum Dr. Erskine
developed in the '40s for the...

00:16.760 --> 00:17.761
Super-soldiers.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.127
Listen, Doctor, your product works.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.044
It appears the volatility
in the serum has been neutralized.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.360
Who's the woman you referred to?

00:25.440 --> 00:27.124
Some rich girl in a flower dress.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.931
We all have to do things
that make us uncomfortable

00:30.000 --> 00:33.243
if we are ever to get
our toy soldiers off the shelf.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.290
That seat is taken.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.925
Perimeter breach! Quad Four!

01:19.000 --> 01:20.411
Three guys just crashed the prison!

01:26.000 --> 01:27.331
Time to go.

01:32.680 --> 01:34.170
"Sir."

01:35.600 --> 01:38.001
- Excuse me?
-"Time to go, sir."

01:38.520 --> 01:40.522
It's time to go, sir!

02:07.360 --> 02:09.328
- Mission briefing in five.
-Okay.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.644
- Katherine Shane?
-Do you know her?

02:12.720 --> 02:14.882
We ran a few ops together in the '90s.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.008
Smart. Resourceful.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.051
Had a soft spot for Truffaut movies.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.685
Easy there, charm school.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.207
According to these files,
Agent Shane could be my mom.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.209
Even if Shane was the agent
who dropped you off at the orphanage,

02:30.280 --> 02:32.009
it doesn't mean she's your mother.

02:32.080 --> 02:35.289
I looked into all the female agents
active when I was born.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.646
- Mmm-hmm.
-Needle, haystack, I know.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.206
But then I factored in
age and marital status,

02:39.280 --> 02:42.045
and then I built a program
to narrow down the field.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.122
You're still looking at a long road.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.844
It would be a lot shorter
if I could access more files.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.843
Maybe you could remove
my Internet nanny?

02:51.040 --> 02:53.088
- I'm talking about my tracking bracelet.
-I got that.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.525
- So you'll take it off?
-No.

02:55.120 --> 02:59.364
But I asked May to look into
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s more restricted files.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.527
I was kind of hoping to keep this private.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.888
Agent May specializes in private.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.287
Let's go.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.160
Nice feint.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.600
I read your file.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.806
Know you favor your left.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.205
That's in there? What else?

03:38.320 --> 03:41.449
Nothing that's news.
You don't play well with others.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.169
I think I've proven that I can.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.926
- More than once.
-Not here.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.088
Towel down.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.642
I need you both
in the command center in five.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.085
At 0800 hours, three men infiltrated
the Havenworth Federal Penitentiary.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.128
infiltrated?
More like cannon-balled.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.328
They were in and out
in less than two minutes.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.925
Left no prints at the scene.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.729
But we do have one lead.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.808
--Centipede.

04:12.880 --> 04:16.281
It seems they salvaged some of
their research from Hong Kong.

04:16.399 --> 04:19.370
So we were right. Chan's platelets
solved their combustion problem.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.603
Now they can create super-soldiers
with no fear of explosion.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.569
Maybe don't get so excited about it.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.126
Two of Centipede's labs
have been destroyed.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.531
But they keep popping back up.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.206
Now they have at least three
of these guys. Maybe more.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.884
Who'd they break out?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.764
Edison Po. Former Marine.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.405
Expert in tactics and rapid response.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.204
He fell off the grid in '08,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.601
reappeared 18 months ago
at a diner in Boston.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.808
Where he stabbed a friend's eyes out.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.281
With a steak knife.
Then finished his meal.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.767
That's funny, Po doesn't look crazy.

04:50.760 --> 04:53.286
I'm kidding.
The guy is a walking mug shot.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.601
Which means he shouldn't be
too hard to track down.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.330
Finding Po
and these Centipede soldiers

04:57.440 --> 04:59.124
is a top priority for S.H.I.E.L.D.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.329
We'll be running point,
but we won't be working alone.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.243
What team did HQ send for backup?

05:04.320 --> 05:06.049
Not a team. A person.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.521
Someone who can help us
fight fire with fire.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.329
Somebody we worked with before?

05:10.400 --> 05:12.050
Not exactly.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.609
Did I beat Captain America's time?

05:37.760 --> 05:39.250
Not even close.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.285
Excuse me.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.411
Agent Coulson?

05:48.480 --> 05:49.766
Mr. Peterson.

05:50.480 --> 05:54.201
If you could put that bulldozer
back where you found it,

05:54.880 --> 05:56.564
we need you to suit up.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.811
This is a bad idea.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.570
While I have you in a good mood,

06:14.640 --> 06:16.802
you should know that
Skye's trying to ID the agent

06:16.880 --> 06:18.928
that dropped her off at the orphanage.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.166
We agreed to protect her from the truth,
so I told her you were looking into it.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.163
She may come to you.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.961
One mistake at a time.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.169
Agent Coulson. Agent May.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.811
Last time you saw her,
you threw her into a brick wall.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.527
Right.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.366
First time around,
I wasn't who I wanted to be.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.444
But now I get it.
Having all this, it's a privilege.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.363
And training to be an agent,
working with S.H.I.E.L.D.,

06:49.440 --> 06:52.171
it's me trying to do better.
Trying to be better.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.011
I just need you to give me a shot.

06:57.040 --> 07:00.965
Everyone deserves a second chance.
But let me be clear.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.004
There will not be a third.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.921
- Understood, sir.
-Good.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.767
It's not good. At all.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.604
The guy was a ticking time bomb.
Literally.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.286
HQ wouldn't have sent him
if he was still combustible.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.522
They must've found a way
to stabilize him somehow.

07:15.640 --> 07:16.641
They stabilize his attitude?

07:16.720 --> 07:18.802
'Cause it was pretty hostile
in Union Station.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.929
Well, it's not like we haven't
opened up our doors to other people.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.128
People with questionable track records.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.885
Not cool. But true.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.886
And don't worry about Mike.
He's a good guy.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.968
Who's been in the Centipede program.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.441
Exactly. He can give us
some super-power backup.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.329
Just saying,
this could easily go sideways.

07:36.400 --> 07:41.042
I mean, the last time we saw this guy,
he was a raging, homicidal maniac...

07:44.840 --> 07:47.320
- He's standing right behind me, isn't he?
-Mmm.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.847
Mr. Peterson, this is Agent Grant Ward.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.491
He's the man
who shot you at Union Station.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.166
Fitz-Simmons
designed the weapon he used,

07:56.240 --> 07:58.208
-and I think you remember...
-Kidnap victim.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.487
You joined S.H.I.E.L.D.?

08:00.560 --> 08:04.963
Yeah. Turns out,
guys in suits, not so bad.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.091
Look, I know Union Station
could've gone another way.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.928
Another team might not have
let me out of there alive.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.370
I owe you. All of you.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.011
That's bygones.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.845
And water under a distant bridge.
Far away.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.081
How's your son?

08:22.360 --> 08:23.691
Still With my sister.

08:23.760 --> 08:27.606
He thinks I'm working construction,
but he's good. Happy.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.686
So what do we have?

08:30.760 --> 08:31.886
Not much on Po.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.530
I checked
his previously known addresses

08:33.600 --> 08:36.443
and old military contacts,
came up empty.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.488
We've been looking for where
Po might be on the outside.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.484
Let's look at his life on the inside.
At the prison.

08:41.559 --> 08:43.210
See if that gets us any leads.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.044
Anything on the Centipede soldiers?

08:45.120 --> 08:47.600
We found a facial recog match
on one of them.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.411
Name's Brian Hayward.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.084
Stationed in Afghanistan
for three years,

08:51.160 --> 08:52.924
then fell off the radar when he got back.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.207
Only living relative, his sister, Laura.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.328
A sophomore at the University of Ohio.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.205
She's our best shot at finding Hayward.
You and I will go talk to her.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.282
Have May set a course for Cleveland.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.604
With all the high-tech gadgets
and gizmos at our disposal,

09:14.680 --> 09:18.162
it's easy to forget about
the simple tools of the past.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.131
What can I do for you?

09:22.200 --> 09:24.441
I'm just curious about
what you want me to do.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.648
- Where you need me.
-Here. On the plane.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.722
But shouldn't I be out in the field?

09:28.800 --> 09:30.768
I mean, that's why
you brought me here, right?

09:30.880 --> 09:32.086
You'll get your chance.

09:32.160 --> 09:35.209
Right now, I need you to
go down to the lab for some tests.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.965
I'm stable.
They already tested me at Sci-Ops.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.761
I know. I also know that
using your powers takes a toll.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.242
I need to understand your limits.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.004
For your sake as well as my team's.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.649
The lab's downstairs.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.166
I have to put away
four times what I used to,

09:53.280 --> 09:54.805
just to keep my energy UP-

09:54.880 --> 09:57.486
Uh, and after you use your strength?

09:57.560 --> 10:00.803
Maybe 10 times the food?
Then I usually crash afterwards.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.121
It's really hard on my body.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.487
Hard, body. Got it.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.642
You do know we have equipment
that can take measurements.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.960
No need to do it manually.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.690
My mistake.

10:10.760 --> 10:14.207
Well, no matter, I'll send the numbers
to you straight away.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.282
I need measurements
to build you a diagnostic suit

10:17.360 --> 10:19.601
so we can monitor
your vitals in the field.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.449
As for fabrics,

10:21.520 --> 10:22.965
how does a polymer blend

10:23.040 --> 10:25.850
with 10 layers
of treated composite material sound?

10:26.200 --> 10:29.044
- Sounds great?
- Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.963
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I was just looking at that...

10:37.040 --> 10:39.281
Oh... No, it's okay. I'm used to it.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.250
They tried to take it off me
at the Sci-Ops facility.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.368
Realized they couldn't do it
without killing me.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.646
I'm afraid we're terribly curious.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.041
How did they stabilize
the EXTREMIS in you?

10:48.120 --> 10:49.610
- And keep you from exploding?
-Yeah.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.411
Oh, that wasn't them.
That was you two.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.891
- Come again?
-What's that?

10:54.960 --> 10:57.850
Your gun. It somehow froze me.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.161
Right at the moment
I was about to explode.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.403
Helped my body absorb the serum,
stabilize.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.808
Your weapon saved my life.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.251
All that, and it didn't even
leave a scar, so...

11:11.320 --> 11:13.243
- Well, I should think not.
-Well... Yeah.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.840
We couldn't have that, could we?

11:15.920 --> 11:17.046
It would be a shame,

11:17.120 --> 11:20.841
especially when you're so well-formed
and symmetrical in the...

11:20.920 --> 11:22.410
When did you stop talking?

11:22.480 --> 11:24.926
About three
embarrassing sentences ago.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.805
Yes. Right.

11:33.600 --> 11:38.322
Unraveling the Female Psyche."

11:38.760 --> 11:41.206
- That's an actual book?
-it's a whole course.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.081
Hayward's sister's in there now.

11:44.880 --> 11:48.805
We'll be at the school in 10.
We'll catch her on her way out.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.284
A whole class. On women.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.121
Time was,
you just had to figure them out.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.601
Solving the puzzle was half the fun.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.567
You solve a lot of puzzles in your day?

12:01.520 --> 12:02.760
A few.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.122
Some more worth it than others.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.971
One was especially rewarding.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.171
What happened?

12:13.040 --> 12:14.724
I died.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.086
Oh...

12:17.160 --> 12:19.049
She wasn't Level 7, sir?

12:19.520 --> 12:23.002
She was a cellist, second chair.

12:23.680 --> 12:28.163
Portland Symphony.
Saw her play whenever I was in town.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.961
You ever see a beautiful woman
play the cello?

12:31.040 --> 12:32.201
Mmm-mmm.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.169
It's something else.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.527
She laughed at my jokes, too,
which was a very nice bonus.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.365
You know where she is now?

12:41.680 --> 12:43.364
Of course I do.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.929
I'm sorry, sir.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.889
I was gone for months.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.443
The Avengers thought I was dead
so I had to keep that up.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.522
S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.087
It's probably better this way.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.447
Maybe if she'd been
part of the Agency?

13:01.520 --> 13:05.684
In my experience,
that's just asking for trouble.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.321
Hey-

13:16.640 --> 13:20.645
Coulson told me you were
helping to find my long-lost folks.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.961
So, thanks.

13:23.040 --> 13:25.008
I'm glad you're in on this with me.
It means a lot.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.327
Right. I can tell you're really into this.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.209
Um, I've done a lot of
the heavy lifting already.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.805
Came up with a shortlist.
I thought you might want...

13:33.880 --> 13:37.566
We're on a mission, Skye.
Is this why you called me here?

13:38.160 --> 13:41.562
No. I was just working on this
while I waited for you.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.408
Uh, I called 'cause
I found something about Po.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.280
Show me.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.684
Po only had one visitor
during his prison stint. Her.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.091
You notice the outfit?

13:51.160 --> 13:53.925
Miles said a girl in a flower dress
asked him to hack S.H.I.E.L.D.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.843
This could be the same girl.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.160
Can we hear the conversation?

13:57.240 --> 13:59.004
That's the bummer.
There was no audio.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.491
But it's not a total loss.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.040
I was able to use
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s lip reading program.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.521
Because we have one of those.

14:05.600 --> 14:09.047
It didn't work on the girl because
she never looks at the camera,

14:09.160 --> 14:12.448
but Po did. Once. And it caught this.

14:14.080 --> 14:17.129
The Clairvoyant
doesn't like to be touched.

14:17.760 --> 14:21.651
I wrote that down so we don't
have to hear that again ever.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.171
The Clairvoyant.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.090
Yeah. Does that mean anything to you?

14:26.160 --> 14:29.960
But it means something to them.
To Po and whoever that woman is.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.769
Her name's Raina.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.171
- You know her?
-Yeah.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.564
She recruited me for Centipede.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.086
Came up to me at the hospital
where I did my back therapy.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.366
Out of the blue.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.282
Told me she could change my life.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.966
Nice to cut my own meat again.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.610
The steak was to your liking?

15:04.680 --> 15:07.047
Overcooked. And the ambience...

15:08.200 --> 15:10.248
We're not here for the decor.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.243
We've stabilized the serum.
Added the implant.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.402
And now we need
The Clairvoyant's help

15:18.520 --> 15:20.284
in finding the key to Stage Three.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.441
I've asked before.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.729
The Clairvoyant has trouble
seeing the man you're looking for.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.689
And his weaknesses.

15:28.920 --> 15:32.288
I don't mean to upset you.
It's the way of things.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.522
This is what's upsetting me.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.449
This S.H.I.E.L.D. team
has destroyed two of our operations.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.364
We move every few days now,
to be safe.

15:43.520 --> 15:47.206
Which causes challenges
for our maintenance problems.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.843
We can't overstate the toll
this takes on our soldiers.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.843
They're drained after every mission.

15:57.880 --> 16:01.487
Our men need regular injections,
constant upkeep.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.723
Difficult when S.H.I.E.L.D.
has us on the run.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.281
Then it's time to stop running.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.970
We're running her
through our systems.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.127
Maybe we can get an ID.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.409
But we're guessing she's Centipede's
recruiter and Po's her latest recruit.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.730
Three super-soldiers
dive-bomb a prison, pluck him out.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.047
He's her number one draft pick.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.167
Why him?

16:31.240 --> 16:33.004
Centipede's making more soldiers.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.050
Maybe they want Po
to coordinate them. Lead them.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.726
His background's tactical strategy.
He fits the bill.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.685
So these guys
have super-soldiers,

16:40.760 --> 16:42.250
an expert military strategist,

16:42.320 --> 16:44.084
and a Clairvoyant
who can see the future.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.401
Anyone else
thinking about switching teams?

16:46.480 --> 16:47.606
They couldn't have a psychic.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.524
There are none on the Index.
They're a myth.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.681
So was Thor.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.841
Maybe it's an alias.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.969
Run it through our databases.
See if anything pops up.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.920
Ward is approaching
Hayward's sister now.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.410
Laura Hayward?

17:01.480 --> 17:03.050
That's me.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.930
Sorry to bother you,
but I was hoping you could help me out.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.240
I hope so, too.

17:07.319 --> 17:10.926
I'm looking for your brother.
Brian. Have you seen him lately?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.684
I'm sorry. Who are you?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.006
Ah...

17:14.520 --> 17:17.967
Dan Filch.
Ohio State Gaming Commission.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.645
We're trying to contact Brian.
Tell him the good news.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.290
- He won the lottery?
-$50,000.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.529
- Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.605
And you're looking for him?

17:29.680 --> 17:31.409
Don't you guys wanna keep the money?

17:31.480 --> 17:33.721
Sure. But we have to at least
try and contact the winners

17:33.800 --> 17:35.131
before the ticket expires.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.049
Your brother's does in six days.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.810
- So if you know where he is...
-I don't.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.446
Sorry. We're not close.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.922
I haven't spoken to him
since he got back from Afghanistan.

17:44.040 --> 17:48.648
Well, now you have a reason to.
50,000 reasons, actually.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.767
So, let us know if you hear from him.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.166
Okay.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.371
Not sure why you wanted to go
with the lottery story, sir.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.761
- It's a tough sell.
-Exactly.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.524
Nothing makes people more suspicious

18:05.600 --> 18:08.524
than a handsome man
offering them free money.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.682
She's making the call now.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.284
Brian. It's me.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.488
Some guy was just
waiting for me at school.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.528
Said you won the lottery.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.450
I know, right?
We're not that lucky.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.764
- Is he local?
- No.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.242
He's in Oakland, California.

18:46.440 --> 18:47.601
Come in.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.087
Oh...

18:51.160 --> 18:53.288
it almost looks homey.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.371
Is that Ace?

19:00.280 --> 19:01.725
- What a cutie.

19:03.440 --> 19:07.126
He must be so proud of you.
His dad working for S.H.I.E.L.D.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.523
Which he can't know
with everything being classified.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.728
It's all right. He knows I'm working.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.723
Called him on his birthday
and gave him

19:14.840 --> 19:17.127
all the Heroes of New York
action figures.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.565
Nice.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.401
Are you two close?

19:23.880 --> 19:25.291
We're a team.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.241
I'd do anything for this little guy.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.528
That's got to be the best feeling.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.204
A son looking up to you.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.282
Who wants to grow up
to be just like you.

19:38.040 --> 19:42.090
Yeah.
Looks like he's growing fast though.

19:49.600 --> 19:53.764
You said you wanted your shot.
Here it is.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.166
I won't let you down.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.284
- I think it's quite smart.
-How does it feel?

20:07.360 --> 20:09.647
It feels good. Comfortable.

20:10.200 --> 20:13.568
Having powers is cheating.
But the suit's pretty cool.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.086
It's perfect
for an array of tactical missions.

20:16.160 --> 20:19.403
Yeah. Also measures your heart rate,
systolic pressures and glucose levels.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.721
All while providing
state-of-the-art ballistic protection.

20:21.800 --> 20:22.767
Yeah.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.330
Thanks.

20:24.840 --> 20:27.047
- Oh! No, thank you.
-We've never been so proud.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.844
Hayward's cell phone
has been traced

20:28.920 --> 20:31.446
to an abandoned factory
about eight miles from here.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.568
Probably Centipede's new lab.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.051
It's certainly been their MO.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.202
We destroy one factory,
they set up another,

20:37.280 --> 20:39.851
putting us back to square one.
This time I want answers.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.160
It means we go in quiet.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.971
Do minimal damage
to the facility and the people inside.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.646
Ward, May, you'll go in
through the west entrance.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.451
Mr. Peterson and I
will enter through the loading clock.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.244
You'll run the back end from outside.

20:51.320 --> 20:52.606
We're doing this just us?

20:52.680 --> 20:55.081
We've been playing Whac-A-Mole
with these guys

20:55.160 --> 20:57.083
since Ward first picked me
out of my van.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.322
Shouldn't Big S.H.I.E.L.D.
be sending in backup?

20:59.400 --> 21:01.767
Trust me, they already did.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.521
Let's move.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.526
No pressure.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.521
- We alone here?
-it appears so.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.443
The only heat signatures
we're reading are yours.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.330
But there's a weird electronic signal.
I'm trying to isolate it.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.763
The place looks emptied out.
Think we're too late?

21:35.840 --> 21:38.889
Fitz, dial Hayward's number. Find out.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.161
- Uh, Sir, you've got company!
- Yeah, we do.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.048
Coming your way!

22:18.440 --> 22:21.569
- Usually packs a bigger punch.
-Yeah. I remember.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.201
What's happening?

23:05.320 --> 23:07.641
His systolic and diastolic pressures
are dropping.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.801
Heart rate's plummeting as well.

23:08.880 --> 23:09.961
Sir, he's in bad shape.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.405
Between the physical exertion
and this wound,

23:11.480 --> 23:13.164
his vitals are dangerously low.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.169
Who's behind Centipede?
Who's doing this?

23:40.960 --> 23:43.327
I won't say anything. I promise.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.969
No. Please! Don't do...

24:05.880 --> 24:09.441
That's Mike Peterson.
One of our first subjects.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.409
He hasn't been injected
with the serum in a while,

24:12.520 --> 24:14.045
but he still has his powers.

24:14.560 --> 24:19.122
No. What he has
is your key to Stage Three.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.323
The one on the left
is Akela Amador's.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.640
Hayward's is on the right.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.609
Now, his prosthetic
was slightly damaged,

24:34.680 --> 24:36.330
but based on digital reconstruction,

24:36.400 --> 24:40.166
we can now confirm
that the technology is virtually identical.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.402
Hayward's prosthetic
is the same internal power source,

24:42.480 --> 24:45.563
backscatter capabilities
and biomechanics as Amador.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.007
So Centipede also designed
the eye implant?

24:48.080 --> 24:50.162
These guys are serious multitaskers.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.480
Who's Akela Amador?

24:51.560 --> 24:53.050
A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

24:53.120 --> 24:56.010
The first person we encountered
with this eye technology.

24:56.080 --> 24:59.004
A good agent who was forced
to do some bad things.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.081
We helped her.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.162
Kind of a pattern with you guys.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.446
So then those soldiers
at the warehouse

25:05.520 --> 25:07.409
were forced to attack us?

25:07.480 --> 25:09.084
Through that eye thing?

25:09.160 --> 25:10.650
They were getting orders.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.643
When the tide turned in our favor,

25:12.720 --> 25:16.281
Centipede flipped Hayward's kill switch,
told the other guys to run.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.690
Can you track the eye feed like before,
find their location?

25:19.760 --> 25:21.603
Nope. They've upgraded since Amador.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.886
Their feed's untraceable now.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.686
Their technology keeps advancing
at a disturbingly rapid pace.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.525
They must have endless manpower,
resources.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.409
And someone with a fat wallet.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.050
Po's the strategist,
Rama's their recruiter.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.531
Perhaps this Clairvoyant's the money.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.726
That makes sense.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.121
If I could see the future,
I'd go straight to Las Vegas.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.246
Whoever's behind them
may or may not be psychic,

25:42.320 --> 25:44.891
but they're one step
ahead of us every time.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.487
I need to update HQ.
This is bigger than we thought.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.402
I spoke with The Clairvoyant.

25:58.480 --> 25:59.766
And?

25:59.840 --> 26:02.889
I'll share the information
when the time is right.

26:04.480 --> 26:08.166
I would love to hear
much more than just information.

26:09.880 --> 26:13.009
Will you tell me what he's like?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.490
Never.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.849
The last person
who tried to learn these things

26:23.920 --> 26:25.888
got a knife for it.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.691
I don't want to have to
do that again, Raina.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.764
You have such pretty eyes.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.885
I understand.

26:36.520 --> 26:39.205
You can't even
whisper to me about him.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.284
No, I can't.

26:42.360 --> 26:45.489
But I did tell The Clairvoyant about you.

26:46.680 --> 26:50.321
Spoke at length
about your many virtues.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.045
How sweet.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.371
I'll pour you a Scotch?

27:14.440 --> 27:17.046
Don't ever do that again.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.641
Brandy, then?

27:19.720 --> 27:22.405
When we're out in the field,
your head needs to be on the op.

27:22.480 --> 27:23.891
Not on me.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.881
Time-out. Still playing catch up here.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.007
What are you talking about?

27:28.080 --> 27:31.971
You! Taking a punch for me?
I don't need your protection.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.530
You think I don't know that?

27:33.600 --> 27:35.841
I took that punch
'cause you're faster than me.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.490
You could do more good on your feet.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.767
It was tactical. Not personal.

27:41.600 --> 27:42.931
My mistake.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.085
I am not some recruit
who can't separate church from state.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.761
I'm on the same page as you.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.362
So don't flatter yourself.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.890
Sorry, I didn't mean to crash.

28:03.560 --> 28:06.564
What do you want?
This about that thumb drive again?

28:07.240 --> 28:09.129
- No.
-Good.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.131
Look, I get that
you don't wanna help with that.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.009
Loud and clear.
Big neon flashing lights.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.525
But I didn't ask, okay?

28:14.600 --> 28:16.284
Coulson doesn't
wanna tell you the truth.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.044
The truth is...

28:20.800 --> 28:22.848
You have to decide why you're here.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.241
We have a mission
and it's not to find your parents.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.049
If you can't put aside
your personal attachments,

28:27.120 --> 28:29.441
then you shouldn't be here.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.523
- Oh, come on in.
-Thanks.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.640
- You doing okay?

29:20.040 --> 29:24.489
Afraid I won't be much good to you
for the next couple days.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.408
That's understandable.

29:27.480 --> 29:30.165
You went above and beyond
at that warehouse.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.402
Had our backs more than once.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.091
Thank you, sir.

29:34.160 --> 29:37.482
But I know Centipede's still out there.
I know we still got a lot of work to do.

29:37.880 --> 29:38.927
True.

29:40.200 --> 29:43.090
But according to your S.O.,
hard work's your specialty.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.129
Said you train 24/7.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.565
I wanna be the best.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.409
And that's admirable.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.683
But you hadn't left the training facility
since you got there.

29:53.760 --> 29:57.082
Which means you haven't seen
your son since Union Station.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.730
Ace is fine.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.883
We talk all the time.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.850
But you haven't been to see him. Why?

30:12.160 --> 30:13.241
Mike!

30:19.520 --> 30:23.923
Because the last time he saw me,
I was a monster.

30:25.080 --> 30:26.764
My kid saw that.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.689
You can't fix that from here.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.851
And staying away, not being there...

30:34.880 --> 30:39.488
I've seen firsthand
the kind of damage that can do.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.646
The last thing I wanna do is hurt Ace.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.051
He's my son.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.804
But maybe he's better off without me.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.291
I don't think that's true.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.881
When I took this job,
I made a choice.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.125
The same choice
everyone else here made.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.886
This life over the other one.

31:03.960 --> 31:09.410
The one with holiday dinners,
and PTA meetings, recitals.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.285
It's not easy.

31:14.400 --> 31:19.042
But, if the time comes
to make the hard call, it's simpler.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.530
But you have a son.

31:22.600 --> 31:26.047
You have someone
waiting for you to come home.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.443
You need to think about that.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.528
You need to think about him

31:33.680 --> 31:35.682
before you make your choice.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.326
Hello?

31:55.400 --> 31:56.765
Hey, Ace.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.365
Dad!

31:58.440 --> 32:01.284
It is so good to hear your voice, buddy.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.691
And I got some good news.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.649
I'm gonna get to come home
and see you for a bit.

32:04.720 --> 32:07.883
Awesome! Then maybe
you can meet my new friend.

32:08.520 --> 32:12.286
She said she knows you.
She's here right now.

32:12.360 --> 32:15.682
Ace, who's there with you?
Where's your Aunt Mindy?

32:16.240 --> 32:17.685
Hello, Mike.

32:19.120 --> 32:22.841
Remember when I told you
I could change your life?

32:33.000 --> 32:35.731
They wanna trade.
Ace for his father.

32:35.800 --> 32:38.121
- They've set a time and a place.
-Bloody savages.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.851
They want to experiment on him.
Determine how he still has his abilities.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.604
And we're gonna let them?
We've fought these guys before.

32:42.680 --> 32:43.727
We don't have a choice.

32:43.800 --> 32:46.246
The instructions they gave
Mr. Peterson were very specific.

32:46.360 --> 32:47.930
I called HQ, told them to stand down.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.968
- Stand down?
-So we take 'em alone.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.930
We should at least have a hostage
rescue unit in support of this.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.241
They said they would murder my son.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.329
If we make one wrong move...

33:00.520 --> 33:04.730
Any electronics, any comms,
any sign of surveillance,

33:04.800 --> 33:06.609
and they'll terminate the arrangement.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.842
I'll give myself up, no problem,
get him back.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.160
I can figure it out from there.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.480
You're still recovering.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.847
We can't just
hand you over to them like that.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.126
Can we?

33:15.200 --> 33:18.044
Fitz-Simmons have a non-electronic
method of tracking him.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.929
Simmons has fabricated
an odorless scent.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.411
I have an instrument
which can detect it,

33:21.520 --> 33:22.760
works like a bloodhound.

33:22.840 --> 33:25.127
Can track someone
from over 50 kilometers.

33:25.200 --> 33:28.044
After we make the trade,
we'll be able to follow Mr. Peterson.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.691
Buy him some time
to get his strength back. We'll find him.

33:30.760 --> 33:34.446
I don't care what happens to me.
As long as my boy is...

33:36.960 --> 33:40.203
I promise you.
We're gonna get your son back.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.769
At least let me escort him out
for the exchange.

34:07.680 --> 34:11.400
Mr. Peterson requested me.
I'm comfortable with that.

34:11.480 --> 34:12.891
And if things go south,

34:12.960 --> 34:16.248
I need you back here
taking point on the team.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.685
Is Ward in position?

34:18.920 --> 34:22.447
Yes. But I don't like any of this.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.802
There'd be something wrong with you
if you did.

34:32.639 --> 34:35.849
Once the swap happens,
I'll fire up my equipment.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.289
We'll be able to track you
wherever they take you.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.681
Just don't do anything
that'll endanger my son.

34:40.760 --> 34:41.886
We won't.

34:41.960 --> 34:46.045
But we wanna make sure Ace
has his dad at the end of the day, too.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.284
Time to go.

35:23.880 --> 35:25.245
My team won't let you down.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.163
It wasn't supposed to go down like this.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.208
I'm gonna make this right, I swear.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.725
Damn it.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.251
Hello, Mike. It's been a while.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.562
Your son is adorable.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.682
And he looks just like you.

36:00.120 --> 36:02.441
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.724
Lucky for you.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.405
I have to thank you, Mike.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.560
For holding up your end of the deal.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.083
Let's just make the trade.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.929
Give us Ace and you can have him.

36:15.760 --> 36:17.250
Oh, that wasn't the deal.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.210
I'm so sorry.

36:25.880 --> 36:29.441
Let me know when I can activate
comms and the tracker.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.483
What's happening here, Mike?

36:32.560 --> 36:37.009
Well, in exchange for his son,
we asked Mike to deliver you.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.201
I'm not at full strength,
but I can still crush your throat.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.090
New deal! My son for your life!

36:52.160 --> 36:56.449
Sadly, my employer cares no more
for my life than your son's.

36:57.120 --> 36:59.771
If I die, so does he.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.365
And his death will be so much worse.

37:05.080 --> 37:06.844
You need to let her go.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.922
I told them they could have me.

37:09.960 --> 37:13.009
But they want you.
Why do they want you?

37:13.080 --> 37:14.206
I don't know.

37:14.280 --> 37:18.251
But if you kill this woman,
you'll never see your son again.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.891
But how will I look him in the eye?

37:22.680 --> 37:24.967
How will I explain what I did?

37:25.360 --> 37:27.806
We talked about this.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.480
I'm so sorry.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.690
Let's finish this.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.681
Dad!

37:59.960 --> 38:01.041
There's his son.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.202
Oh, thank God.
I have no stomach for this.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.965
On my mark,
activate comms and tracker.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.208
If there'd been any other way...

38:16.880 --> 38:19.884
You made the only choice you had.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.369
What happened?
They took Coulson.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.602
All right, call it in.
We need back up.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.400
I have a shot.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.444
Do not engage.
They'll kill Coulson.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.568
Stand down, I'll contact HQ.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.686
Are you okay?

38:57.760 --> 38:59.489
I'm fine, Dad.

38:59.560 --> 39:01.642
S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ,
this is S.H.I.E.L.D. R.G. 422.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.927
We need immediate satellite support.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.126
Ace, I gotta make something right.

39:08.240 --> 39:12.404
Daddy loves you so much.
Okay? Stay with Skye.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.369
You remember Skye, right?

39:14.440 --> 39:16.602
Keep him safe.
Take care of my boy!

39:22.640 --> 39:24.051
No!

39:28.240 --> 39:29.605
Mike!

39:33.840 --> 39:35.365
Where's Coulson?

39:41.000 --> 39:43.048
Oh, my God. Coulson.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.407
We land in half an hour.

40:28.520 --> 40:32.411
Good. The sooner we begin, the better.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.561
Whatever this is,
whatever you think you're doing,

40:38.640 --> 40:39.880
it won't work.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.045
I won't give you what you want.

40:42.520 --> 40:46.047
You will. And what we want is simple.

40:48.880 --> 40:53.204
We want you to tell us
about the day after you died.
