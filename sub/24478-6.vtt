00:01.965 --> 00:03.379
Previously on "In Contempt"...

00:03.517 --> 00:05.827
What is the deal with you
and Bennet? And Charlie?

00:05.965 --> 00:07.827
Who actually likes you,
by the way.

00:07.965 --> 00:09.482
Charlie doesn'’t like
anyone but himself.

00:09.620 --> 00:11.137
He can never be serious,
it is exhausting.

00:11.275 --> 00:13.000
Charlie, you have
to get him a program!

00:13.137 --> 00:14.931
Talk to his mother,
get her to plead his case!

00:15.068 --> 00:17.965
You know it'’s insane to roll
the dice on this dash and cash.

00:18.103 --> 00:19.379
Really?

00:19.517 --> 00:21.034
Sorry, I stopped listening
at call his mommy.

00:21.172 --> 00:22.344
I know you'’re sleeping
with my husband.

00:22.482 --> 00:24.586
Frankly, he'’s done better.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.482
I would think long and hard

00:26.620 --> 00:28.586
before asking me
to recuse myself.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.862
Yup. Thought about it.
We still want you to step down.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.172
You recused Blackburn

00:32.310 --> 00:33.896
even though I explicitly
told you not to

00:34.034 --> 00:35.310
and you lost!

00:35.448 --> 00:37.068
I just want a chance
to defend the innocent.

00:37.206 --> 00:38.620
When you see one of those
walk by here, you let me know.

00:38.758 --> 00:40.586
Does anyone care about
the law around here?

00:40.724 --> 00:42.310
If you don'’t step back, you'll
be spending the night in jail.

00:42.448 --> 00:44.068
Bennet is a real man.

00:44.206 --> 00:46.689
He'’s not a scrub, he's not
a boy, he'’s not a game.

00:46.827 --> 00:48.241
Just tell him how you feel.

00:48.379 --> 00:51.137
Gwen, this is Alison,
my fiancée.

00:53.379 --> 00:55.413
Step away from the vehicle.
Hands behind your head.

00:55.551 --> 00:58.689
I didn'’t do nothing, man!
get off of me!

00:59.034 --> 01:01.344
You should'’ve seen
the way he looked at me.

01:02.793 --> 01:04.551
Like I was garbage.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.517
Who the hell is
Greta Constantine?

01:17.724 --> 01:20.620
And why does her jacket
cost as much as an iPhone?

01:20.758 --> 01:23.724
Well, she is a black guy
and an Asian dude.

01:23.862 --> 01:25.517
I'’m so confused.

01:25.655 --> 01:27.275
That'’s from last year'’s
collection. I got it on sale.

01:27.827 --> 01:29.758
Damn! You don'’t ever
got to shop no more.

01:29.896 --> 01:32.103
You got fresh tags,
new purses, new shoes...

01:32.241 --> 01:35.000
- Your closet is a store!
- Get out of my closet.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.172
What'’s up with you
not opening your mail and all?

01:37.310 --> 01:40.034
Hey! Monthly bills.
To maintain my self-esteem,

01:40.172 --> 01:41.896
I open the ones
I can'’t pay last.

01:42.034 --> 01:45.103
Ah! Live like a superstar
on a reality star'’s budget.

01:45.241 --> 01:46.931
You need an intervention
in here?

01:51.724 --> 01:53.862
Hey, do you want to be my date
to a wedding shower?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.896
It'’s Bennet and his fiancée,
Alison.

01:56.551 --> 01:58.965
- Uh, thanks but I'’ll pass.
- Come on, why not?

01:59.103 --> 02:01.310
'‘Cause you always say
we'’re friends with benefits.

02:01.448 --> 02:03.344
And this feels more like
an obligation than a benefit.

02:03.482 --> 02:06.344
- Fine. Forget I asked.
- You know what? OK.

02:06.482 --> 02:09.103
Maybe she might have
some fine friends.

02:09.689 --> 02:11.275
I suppose I can do you a solid.

02:12.482 --> 02:13.965
Thanks.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.655
Well, them benefits,
this time.

02:17.793 --> 02:19.793
- No, stop!
- Good morning!

02:21.344 --> 02:22.620
Saved by the bell!

02:24.551 --> 02:26.172
Oh shit, it'’s Tom!

02:26.758 --> 02:28.827
Blackburn wants to see me
in her courtroom now.

02:29.241 --> 02:30.827
What did you do this time?

02:38.103 --> 02:39.862
Judge, whatever it is,
it wasn'’t calendared.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.689
I didn'’t know I was supposed
to appear in front of you today.

02:41.827 --> 02:43.965
This isn'’t about you,
Ms. Sullivan.

02:45.827 --> 02:47.551
Meet Juror no. 5.

02:48.310 --> 02:50.724
I called for you because
he needs a public defender.

02:50.862 --> 02:53.758
And he needs a public defender
because I am about to hold him

02:53.896 --> 02:57.034
in contempt of court and
I don'’t want anyone to think

02:57.172 --> 02:59.448
that he didn'’t have
the loudest defense.

02:59.965 --> 03:02.068
Appreciate your
vote of confidence, Judge.

03:02.206 --> 03:06.620
Let'’s just say the past
is the past, and I, for one,

03:06.758 --> 03:11.448
- can let it go.
- That'’s beautiful.

03:12.241 --> 03:14.689
Now, can I have a moment with
my client to speak to him

03:14.827 --> 03:18.034
- and find out what happened?
- I'’ll explain what happened.

03:18.206 --> 03:21.000
Juror no. 5
has a felony conviction.

03:21.137 --> 03:24.482
Do you know what you cannot do
if you have a felony conviction?

03:24.620 --> 03:28.896
- Sit on a jury.
- Precisely, and yet, somehow,

03:29.310 --> 03:32.689
Juror no. 5 managed to get
himself seated on my jury.

03:32.827 --> 03:35.310
I had to declare a mistrial
because of him.

03:35.448 --> 03:37.344
- What'’s his name?
- Excuse me?

03:37.482 --> 03:39.034
Well, you keep referring to him
as Juror no. 5.

03:39.172 --> 03:40.896
I'’m just wondering what
his actual name is.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.758
Anthony Henry.

03:45.206 --> 03:47.931
He has disrupted
the proceedings of this court,

03:48.068 --> 03:50.275
and I intend
to hold him in contempt.

03:50.413 --> 03:53.827
Something that you are
quite familiar with.

03:55.517 --> 03:56.896
I'’m also directing
the DA'’s office

03:57.034 --> 03:58.655
to conduct
a perjury investigation.

03:58.896 --> 04:01.827
Contempt and perjury, that'’s...
like going after him twice

04:01.965 --> 04:05.068
for the same conduct,
or alleged conduct.

04:05.206 --> 04:07.689
When he lied, he committed
an offence against me

04:07.827 --> 04:10.310
and the good people
of the State of New York.

04:10.448 --> 04:12.137
And lying during
pro forma questioning

04:12.275 --> 04:15.379
and on his juror questionnaire
would technically be perjury.

04:15.758 --> 04:17.034
Kiss-ass.

04:17.172 --> 04:19.379
Ms. Sullivan,
let me make something clear.

04:19.517 --> 04:22.896
When I said I wanted Mr. Henry
to have the loudest defense,

04:24.000 --> 04:25.551
that wasn'’t a compliment.

04:44.310 --> 04:45.758
We were deadlocked.

04:46.103 --> 04:48.517
And the judge kept saying
"“keep trying"”, right?

04:48.689 --> 04:50.034
It got a little crazy
in the jury room.

04:50.172 --> 04:51.896
Then I said,
that I didn'’t think

04:52.034 --> 04:53.655
that anybody should go to jail
for a crime that wasn'’t violent.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.793
Woo! All hell broke loose.

04:55.931 --> 04:59.586
Okay, because a fellow juror
complained, the judge got upset.

04:59.862 --> 05:02.137
Did some investigating,
and found your felony.

05:02.275 --> 05:04.482
Felony? I ain'’t got no felony.
I picked up a marijuana charge

05:04.620 --> 05:06.413
a while back, but I didn't
go to jail or nothing.

05:06.551 --> 05:08.517
Even though you didn'’t
go to jail, your possession case

05:08.655 --> 05:10.862
- was a felony.
- It was?

05:11.551 --> 05:12.724
That was a lot of weed.

05:13.586 --> 05:16.551
Yeah, I know. My wife keeps
saying I need to cut back.

05:17.413 --> 05:20.172
It says here you bounced
a check for 356$

05:20.310 --> 05:21.758
to a debt collection agency.

05:21.896 --> 05:23.689
They bought by $5,000
credit card debt

05:23.827 --> 05:25.758
and they have been coming
after me for like a year now.

05:25.896 --> 05:28.448
They'’re calling me 247.
They even garnish my wages.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.137
Look, I am trying to pay,
but I'’m struggling.

05:31.275 --> 05:32.862
This wasn'’t
your first bad check.

05:33.241 --> 05:34.896
Fifteen years ago,
I got caught up

05:35.034 --> 05:38.275
with this bad guy, and he was
doing a check kiting scheme,

05:38.413 --> 05:39.931
and I was helping him.

05:40.448 --> 05:43.551
But I haven'’t done anything
like that for 15 years.

05:44.068 --> 05:46.000
I have three kids.
I have a job.

05:46.965 --> 05:49.310
I know it looks bad,
but I swear I did not know.

05:49.448 --> 05:52.586
I mean, I thought
that my paycheck would clear.

05:52.724 --> 05:53.931
It usually clears every Friday.

05:54.068 --> 05:55.896
So, why are they
pressing charges?

05:56.965 --> 05:59.103
My friend told me I didn'’t have
to talk to them on the phone,

05:59.241 --> 06:01.551
but when I told them that,
they got really mad.

06:01.689 --> 06:03.517
So, I don'’t know,
maybe that'’s why?

06:04.655 --> 06:06.896
Okay.
I'’ll talk to the prosecutor.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.344
Look, Anthony, I know
this whole thing seems crazy,

06:12.482 --> 06:14.344
but perjury is a serious crime.

06:14.482 --> 06:16.344
It'’s class D felony.
Up to seven years in prison.

06:16.482 --> 06:18.655
I didn'’t want to be
on no jury or nothing.

06:18.793 --> 06:20.379
I got the summons.
I figured I better show up

06:20.517 --> 06:23.068
or they'’re going to drop
a warrant on me or something.

06:23.965 --> 06:26.448
Any other judge would have just
excused you from the jury

06:26.586 --> 06:29.931
and put in an alternate,
but Blackburn'’s pretty hardcore.

06:32.655 --> 06:34.206
Okay so, what
are we going to do?

06:34.344 --> 06:36.241
Well, first I'’m going to kiss
Blackburn'’s ring.

06:36.379 --> 06:38.827
We'’ll tell her that no one was
trying to disrespect her court.

06:38.965 --> 06:41.206
- Then maybe she'’ll drop it.
- Let'’s hope.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.103
- Should I call my wife, or...?
- No. I think it'’ll be fine.

06:45.241 --> 06:46.793
I'’ll see you in there.

06:48.068 --> 06:50.344
What are you still doing here?
Go home.

06:50.482 --> 06:52.517
I'’ll tell Blackburn
I gave the case to Tracy.

06:52.655 --> 06:54.172
Forget it.
She'’s trying to hammer a guy

06:54.310 --> 06:55.689
who was just doing
his civic duty.

06:55.827 --> 06:57.344
I want to be the one
to stop her.

06:57.482 --> 06:59.000
And don'’t you think
your history with Blackburn

06:59.137 --> 07:00.620
is precisely
why Tracy should take the case?

07:00.758 --> 07:02.310
Nuh-uh, no, it'’s mine.

07:02.448 --> 07:05.586
Our history together
is precisely why I got this.

07:08.586 --> 07:11.586
Mr. Hammond. Lottie Cox.
The bad check.

07:11.724 --> 07:12.793
Thirty days.

07:12.931 --> 07:14.206
- In jail?
- Uh-huh.

07:14.344 --> 07:16.448
- That seems like a lot.
- Then $1,000 bail.

07:16.586 --> 07:19.034
- For a bad check?
- She has a record.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.896
- That was 15 years ago!
- Aw, let me guess.

07:21.034 --> 07:24.344
You want community service
and we all sing Kumbaya?

07:27.206 --> 07:30.206
People vs. Brenda McGuiness.
Step up!

07:30.344 --> 07:32.482
I'’ve had the opportunity
to consult with Mr. Henry

07:32.620 --> 07:34.206
and do some investigating,
Judge.

07:34.344 --> 07:36.827
And I think this is all
just a misunderstanding.

07:36.965 --> 07:38.241
Mr. Henry had no agenda,

07:38.379 --> 07:39.931
or motive or intent
to mislead the court.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.793
He really responded
to a jury summons.

07:41.931 --> 07:45.275
And lied.
We ask 50 questions

07:45.413 --> 07:48.344
explicitly to weed out people
who have been incarcerated.

07:48.482 --> 07:50.896
Oh, Your Honor, Mr. Henry
has never been incarcerated.

07:51.034 --> 07:52.931
He didn'’t even know
he plead guilty to a felony!

07:53.068 --> 07:55.793
He understood what was going on
and he tried to undermine

07:55.931 --> 07:58.379
the workings
of the judicial system.

07:58.931 --> 08:01.344
He said as much
when he told his fellow jurors

08:01.482 --> 08:03.034
that no one should be
incarcerated

08:03.172 --> 08:04.448
for a non-violent crime.

08:04.586 --> 08:06.793
I think that was just
his opinion, Your Honor.

08:06.931 --> 08:08.310
I don'’t think
that that'’s evidence

08:08.448 --> 08:10.413
that he was trying
to subvert the process.

08:10.551 --> 08:11.965
It doesn'’t make any sense
that he would go

08:12.103 --> 08:14.344
to such lengths
to screw up a trial.

08:15.344 --> 08:17.620
Are you implying, Ms. Sullivan,
that this court

08:17.758 --> 08:20.827
- doesn'’t make any sense?
- No, not at all.

08:20.965 --> 08:22.896
I order the both of you
to be ready to proceed

08:23.034 --> 08:24.931
on the contempt charge
this afternoon.

08:25.068 --> 08:26.758
Mr. Patel,
I except you will have

08:26.896 --> 08:28.758
completed your
perjury investigation by then.

08:28.896 --> 08:30.310
I will do my best, Your Honor.

08:35.551 --> 08:37.137
If you bring perjury charges
against him,

08:37.275 --> 08:38.965
in addition to the contempt,
it'’s going to look

08:39.103 --> 08:40.862
like you'’re punishing a juror
for wanting to acquit.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.344
Gwen, I don'’t have a choice,
alright?

08:42.482 --> 08:43.827
She already called my
supervisor.

08:43.965 --> 08:45.310
You don'’t have evidence
of intent.

08:45.448 --> 08:47.310
And a jury'’s never going
to convict him.

08:47.448 --> 08:49.275
Just tell her you investigated
and you don'’t think

08:49.413 --> 08:53.137
- you can make out the perjury.
- And have her come after me?

08:53.448 --> 08:56.482
Oh my God, how do I actually
have bigger balls than you?

08:59.103 --> 09:00.413
I'’m sorry.

09:01.068 --> 09:03.275
Look, just tell Blackburn
you need more time.

09:04.034 --> 09:05.862
That you'’ll convene
a Grand Jury.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.241
It'’s not fair to do a hearing
on the contempt this quickly,

09:08.379 --> 09:10.275
never mind the trial on perjury!

09:11.931 --> 09:14.413
Come on.
It'’s the right thing to do.

09:17.172 --> 09:19.689
Hammond wants 30 days
on a misdemeanor bad check.

09:19.862 --> 09:22.517
Oh, please! Old Hammie knows
I'’ll never go for that.

09:22.758 --> 09:24.000
So, what should we do?

09:25.137 --> 09:28.310
- What did you say?
- She only has one prior.

09:30.206 --> 09:31.793
Sorry, baby. I'’ll be right back.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.379
Gotta make myself scarce
for a minute.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.517
The prosecutor
is offering 30 days.

09:39.655 --> 09:40.965
In jail?!

09:42.862 --> 09:44.517
I have three kids
and a mother at home.

09:44.655 --> 09:47.068
Thirty days I don'’t work
are thirty days they don'’t eat.

09:47.206 --> 09:48.965
You don'’t have any
vacation days?

09:49.896 --> 09:51.310
No.

09:52.206 --> 09:53.517
And what about bail?

09:53.655 --> 09:56.206
The prosecution is asking
for 1,000 dollars.

09:57.620 --> 10:00.103
How am I supposed to afford that
when I can'’t even afford

10:00.241 --> 10:03.620
- to pay the collection agency?
- I know.

10:03.758 --> 10:05.896
But the judge
is not gonna let you out.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.724
I think the offer is high.

10:07.862 --> 10:09.689
I think we can put the case off
until tomorrow

10:09.827 --> 10:11.931
and get a better deal
from the next prosecutor.

10:13.448 --> 10:16.000
- And what happens if we can'’t?
- I think we can.

10:40.137 --> 10:41.655
Gwen!

10:47.896 --> 10:49.068
Hey!

10:50.655 --> 10:52.586
Jesus, Bennet,
don'’t scare me like that!

10:52.724 --> 10:55.206
Sorry, I'’ve been calling
your name.

10:56.137 --> 10:57.517
I don'’t even know
if I want you in my room.

10:57.655 --> 10:59.413
I heard you were cavorting
with the enemy.

10:59.551 --> 11:01.586
Well, actually, to be fair,
they don'’t seem all that bad.

11:01.724 --> 11:05.586
I'’m not listening to
you '‘cause you drank the juice!

11:06.517 --> 11:08.551
- Tracy told me about your case.
- Ugh.

11:08.689 --> 11:10.931
I do not know why I try to be
civil with Judge Blackburn.

11:11.068 --> 11:13.241
She has all the compassion
of a pit viper.

11:13.413 --> 11:15.620
You think she'’d screw your
client just to get back at you.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.793
I think she is determined
to hammer Mr. Henry.

11:17.931 --> 11:19.482
Her personally asking me
to represent him

11:19.620 --> 11:21.103
just gives her a cover,
since everyone knows

11:21.241 --> 11:23.137
I moved to recuse her
from my case.

11:23.275 --> 11:25.551
Punishing me is
just icing on her crazy cake.

11:25.965 --> 11:27.482
- Hi!
- Hi!

11:27.620 --> 11:29.241
Um, okay.

11:30.448 --> 11:34.172
What'’s a good dispo
on a bad check under 500$?

11:34.310 --> 11:35.793
- Any priors?
- Just one.

11:35.931 --> 11:37.793
I was thinking
ten days'’ community service.

11:38.275 --> 11:39.655
For bouncing a check?

11:39.793 --> 11:41.551
Bad check statutes
make it a crime to be poor.

11:41.689 --> 11:43.275
Bounce too many
and you'’re guilty.

11:43.413 --> 11:45.310
The DA doesn'’t even need
to prove intent to defraud.

11:45.448 --> 11:47.137
You know, I never actually
bounced a check?

11:47.275 --> 11:48.896
That is '‘cause you'’re rich
and you probably have

11:49.034 --> 11:50.689
- overdraft protection.
- That'’s true.

11:50.827 --> 11:52.000
My parents were crazy strict

11:52.137 --> 11:54.137
about being
financially responsible.

11:54.827 --> 11:57.103
Ten days'’ community service
sounds about right, Vanessa.

11:57.241 --> 11:58.620
- Is that all?
- What?

11:58.758 --> 12:01.724
- You need anything else?
- Oh, no! Thanks. Bye!

12:03.172 --> 12:05.862
So. What are you going to do
about your case?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.413
I don'’t know.
There'’s no jury

12:07.551 --> 12:08.965
on a contempt charge
and it'’s pretty clear

12:09.103 --> 12:10.620
Blackburn'’s
already made up her mind.

12:10.758 --> 12:12.482
There'’s got to be something
she'’s afraid of.

12:12.620 --> 12:13.965
Judges are only afraid
of two things:

12:14.103 --> 12:16.655
a reversal on an appeal
and bad press.

12:16.793 --> 12:18.206
And, as the saying goes,
no judge

12:18.344 --> 12:21.551
ever made the front page
by being too hard on crime.

12:22.482 --> 12:24.413
I think I know that look.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.655
A story about a juror
spending time in jail

12:27.793 --> 12:30.689
because he doesn'’t know
a misdemeanor from a felony.

12:31.103 --> 12:33.103
- You'’re calling a reporter?
- Yeah.

12:33.241 --> 12:36.655
I freelance for The Examiner!
Let me make a few phone calls

12:36.793 --> 12:38.068
and I'’ll meet you
at the hearing.

12:38.206 --> 12:41.517
- Okay.
- Hey, by the way,

12:41.793 --> 12:43.310
you'’re still coming
to the wedding shower, right?

12:43.448 --> 12:45.034
Of course.
I'’m bringing Charlie.

12:45.172 --> 12:48.000
- Charlie from the office?
- Yeah, we'’re friends.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.206
- The more the merrier, right?
- Right.

13:08.586 --> 13:10.275
So this is the case
from yesterday?

13:10.413 --> 13:13.137
Yes. I put it over
so we could get a better deal.

13:13.275 --> 13:15.896
- Gwen said community service.
- Sounds right.

13:16.034 --> 13:19.965
Campbell! Judge Dawson
wants to see you ASAP.

13:20.724 --> 13:22.551
Sorry, Bambi.
Business elsewhere.

13:22.689 --> 13:24.724
You got this. Be strong.
Have a backbone.

13:24.862 --> 13:27.275
Fight like those Prada'’s
depend on it.

13:34.275 --> 13:38.310
I know you have been texting me,
but I have been so busy that--

13:40.517 --> 13:42.310
You have been ignoring me
all week.

13:42.448 --> 13:44.620
I have been busy
and I'’m in court now,

13:44.758 --> 13:46.344
so I'’m gonna have to
push our nooner.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.344
I heard what happened
at the gala.

13:49.586 --> 13:52.689
Oh, please, I could not give
a sweet damn about your wife.

13:52.827 --> 13:54.517
- Are you upset?
- Why would I be?

13:54.655 --> 13:57.586
- I'’m not married to her.
- I'’m cheating on her with you.

13:57.724 --> 14:00.344
Well, if you'’re so worried
about it, stop cheating.

14:17.413 --> 14:20.000
So, Ms. Milltown,
the bad check case?

14:20.137 --> 14:21.379
- Ninety days.
- Ninety days?

14:21.517 --> 14:23.137
Hammond offered me
30 days yesterday.

14:23.275 --> 14:26.689
Well, that was his stupidity.
And that was yesterday.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.758
Just because I'’m new
does not mean that

14:28.896 --> 14:30.620
- you can take advantage of me.
- Maybe because you'’re new

14:30.758 --> 14:33.103
you don'’t know that
a third offence equals a felony.

14:33.241 --> 14:35.482
Statutory minimum
is one and a half to three.

14:35.620 --> 14:37.137
So, 90 days is a gift.

14:37.275 --> 14:40.275
I know the law.
My client only has one prior.

14:40.413 --> 14:44.068
- From 15 years ago.
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

14:44.551 --> 14:48.206
She'’s got two.
The last one was six months ago.

14:50.275 --> 14:52.862
Oh my God, I didn'’t see it!
It was under a staple!

14:53.000 --> 14:54.862
Look, the best I can do
is 80 days.

14:55.379 --> 14:57.827
Can'’t you just re-offer
the 30 days? It was my fault.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.103
Don'’t mistake my generosity
for weakness.

15:00.241 --> 15:03.241
She'’s a thief. 80 days.
Take it or leave it.

15:03.896 --> 15:07.517
Docket no. 456,
The People vs. Lottie Cox.

15:07.655 --> 15:09.000
Step up.

15:13.620 --> 15:17.241
Counselor.
No cell phones in the courtroom.

15:19.310 --> 15:20.517
What'’s going on?

15:22.241 --> 15:25.275
- Your Honor, may we approach?
- Problem?

15:27.103 --> 15:28.827
I made a horrible mistake.

15:29.241 --> 15:30.931
I didn'’t see
my client'’s second prior,

15:31.068 --> 15:33.103
so I rejected the People'’s
previous offer of 30 days,

15:33.241 --> 15:34.655
and now they'’re offering
80 days.

15:34.793 --> 15:36.034
And what would you
like me to do?

15:36.172 --> 15:37.586
You can give her the 30 days.

15:37.827 --> 15:39.586
Mrs. Cox should not pay
for my mistake.

15:39.724 --> 15:41.655
Counselor, 80 days is
more than fair

15:41.793 --> 15:43.448
for someone with three offences.

15:43.586 --> 15:46.034
Your Honor, it was
a debt collection agency.

15:46.172 --> 15:47.517
She was paying them back.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.310
She thought her paycheck
had cleared.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.827
Oh, please! She'’s got a history
and plenty of poor people

15:50.965 --> 15:52.758
don'’t bounce checks
over and over.

15:54.068 --> 15:55.758
Sorry, Counselor.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.448
The offer is 80 days.

16:04.689 --> 16:06.689
What?
Yesterday it was only 30.

16:06.827 --> 16:08.931
You didn'’t tell me that you were
arrested a few months ago.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.931
But it'’s the same company!
I told you, they keep

16:11.068 --> 16:12.931
coming after me!
Can we do a trial?

16:13.068 --> 16:14.793
I mean, that way I can explain
how it happened.

16:14.931 --> 16:17.275
Unless we can prove that the
check didn'’t actually bounce,

16:17.413 --> 16:19.379
there is no defense.
The fact that you didn'’t mean

16:19.517 --> 16:21.275
for it to bounce
doesn'’t actually help.

16:21.413 --> 16:23.793
Counselor, 80 days!
Yes, or no?

16:23.931 --> 16:25.448
Your Honor, please,
a moment?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
You turn this down,
it only gets worse.

16:30.068 --> 16:32.103
Your Honor, please.
I don'’t understand.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.689
I work really hard,
I feed my kids. I didn'’t--

16:34.827 --> 16:36.758
Ms. Cox, talk to your lawyer,
not to me.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.551
- I'’m sorry.
- Take the 80 days.

16:38.689 --> 16:41.965
I can'’t. Oh my God,
why won'’t you listen to me?

16:42.103 --> 16:43.551
Tomorrow it could be two years.

16:43.689 --> 16:45.793
- Two years?!
- Please.

16:45.931 --> 16:48.172
- Take the plea.
- Oh, my God!

16:53.482 --> 16:56.655
Mr. Patel, have you concluded
your perjury investigation?

17:01.206 --> 17:02.931
Um, not at this time.

17:03.068 --> 17:05.206
I know Your Honor would want me
to be thorough,

17:05.344 --> 17:06.896
so our office is considering
bringing the matter

17:07.034 --> 17:10.689
- before a Grand Jury.
- Fine.

17:11.551 --> 17:13.241
Are you ready on the contempt,
Ms. Sullivan?

17:13.379 --> 17:15.586
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Alright, you may proceed.

17:17.965 --> 17:19.620
Your Honor,
our evidence will show

17:19.758 --> 17:22.862
that Mr. Henry'’s only crime
was to obey a jury summons.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.655
To hold him in contempt would be
to penalize an innocent man

17:25.793 --> 17:28.344
for fulfilling
a civic responsibility,

17:28.586 --> 17:30.448
unlike most people,
who shirk jury service

17:30.586 --> 17:34.068
with every excuse in the book.
Mr. Henry stepped up.

17:34.413 --> 17:35.724
To penalize him for that

17:35.862 --> 17:37.586
would be to make him
a second-class citizen.

17:37.724 --> 17:42.103
Excuse me. Who are you?
Yeah, you. With the busy hands.

17:43.482 --> 17:44.758
Oh. I'’m Bennet Thomson,
Your Honor.

17:44.896 --> 17:46.586
What'’s your purpose here today?

17:46.724 --> 17:48.931
I'’m covering this case for The
New York Examiner, Your Honor.

17:51.655 --> 17:55.034
Yes, my client had a marijuana
conviction in his past,

17:55.172 --> 17:57.896
but how many times
must he pay for that same crime?

17:58.103 --> 18:00.896
Every time he applies for a job
or housing and has to check

18:01.034 --> 18:03.448
- the conviction box...
- That'’s enough, Counselor.

18:03.586 --> 18:05.379
- Your Honor?
- That'’s enough for today.

18:05.827 --> 18:08.137
I am continuing these
proceedings until Mr. Patel

18:08.275 --> 18:10.827
can bring the perjury charge
to a Grand Jury.

18:15.620 --> 18:16.862
Thank you.

18:21.137 --> 18:23.034
- What just happened?
- You happened.

18:23.344 --> 18:25.103
Now maybe she'’ll calm down
off of the contempt,

18:25.241 --> 18:27.758
I have more time to prepare
and I can lobby the DA'’s office.

18:27.896 --> 18:30.068
- So, thank you.
- No, thank you.

18:30.206 --> 18:31.896
You know, watching you work
is like having

18:32.034 --> 18:34.689
a front-row seat
to an all-star game.

18:42.137 --> 18:43.862
- He said what?
- Uh-huh.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.724
You need to tell that man how
you feel before it'’s too late.

18:46.862 --> 18:48.448
And you need to tell me you'’re
not doing the thing

18:48.586 --> 18:49.827
that I know you'’re still doing

18:49.965 --> 18:51.241
with a man
who shall remain nameless.

18:51.379 --> 18:52.620
He'’s not Voldemort.

18:52.758 --> 18:54.310
Then why didn't you tell me
about him.

18:54.448 --> 18:55.793
Here I am spilling my guts
about the one who got away,

18:55.931 --> 18:57.379
and my bestie
is having an affair

18:57.517 --> 18:58.965
and not telling me
a damn thing about it.

18:59.103 --> 19:01.379
- It doesn'’t mean anything.
- Bullshit!

19:02.034 --> 19:03.965
- You'’re bullshitting.
- Where were you?

19:05.068 --> 19:07.000
Calm down, Bambi.
Why so dramatic?

19:07.241 --> 19:09.862
That bad check case,
she got 80 days.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.068
- Christ on a cracker, how?
- I screwed up.

19:12.206 --> 19:13.586
I didn'’t know
she had two priors.

19:13.724 --> 19:15.000
What do you mean
you didn'’t know?

19:15.137 --> 19:16.965
There was a second one
under a staple.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.827
I told her to turn down 30 days.

19:20.551 --> 19:21.896
I thought you were
supervising her.

19:22.034 --> 19:24.655
I had to step out!
Jesus, Bambi, toughen up.

19:24.793 --> 19:26.965
- Stop calling me Bambi!
- Okay, listen.

19:27.103 --> 19:28.482
We all make mistakes.

19:28.896 --> 19:31.068
I just don'’t want to end up
talking to myself in a closet

19:31.206 --> 19:35.206
- like some weirdo. No offense.
- None taken.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.275
Is there any way
that I can fix this?

19:38.413 --> 19:39.620
Some things can'’t be fixed.

19:39.758 --> 19:41.413
You just learn to deal
and you move on.

19:41.551 --> 19:44.137
You guys keep saying this,
but it'’s not getting any better.

19:44.275 --> 19:45.689
It'’s getting worse.

19:45.827 --> 19:46.965
Okay, you want me to show you
what really helps?

19:47.103 --> 19:48.413
- Yes.
- You want to join?

19:48.551 --> 19:50.310
Honey, you know
I don'’t hit people.

19:56.793 --> 19:58.896
I'’m guessing there'’s
no Zumba classes.

19:59.310 --> 20:01.172
No. No Jacuzzi, no spa.

20:01.310 --> 20:02.931
Are we really going
to hit each other?

20:03.068 --> 20:05.241
Just the bag. Baby steps.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.724
Okay, how do you do that?

20:12.862 --> 20:16.827
Years of Bikram yoga.
You should try it sometime.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.758
Hot yoga, vagi-steam,
hot sauna...

20:18.896 --> 20:20.655
You know, you need to stop
paying for hot shit.

20:20.793 --> 20:22.310
You need to move your body.

20:22.448 --> 20:24.758
Throw a few jabs,
take a few hits.

20:26.862 --> 20:28.965
- What?
- I'’m not used to this.

20:29.586 --> 20:31.862
You know, boxing didn'’t come
naturally to me, either.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.448
Actually, I got the bug
from my dad.

20:33.586 --> 20:34.793
We used to watch bouts
when I was a little girl--

20:34.931 --> 20:36.517
No, I mean the way I grew up.

20:37.379 --> 20:40.827
I'’m not used to being around
a lot of... people like us.

20:41.103 --> 20:43.551
- People like us?
- You know, African-Americans.

20:43.689 --> 20:45.758
Girl, you know you can say
black people, right?

20:48.517 --> 20:50.655
I grew up
in Darien, Connecticut.

20:51.241 --> 20:53.896
I'’m used to being the only
black person in the room.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.000
I know how to be that person.

20:56.137 --> 20:58.965
But our job,
even being here, I--

20:59.103 --> 21:01.241
usually I feel like
I'’m too black,

21:01.793 --> 21:04.241
but lately I'’ve been feeling
like I'’m not black enough.

21:04.862 --> 21:07.241
You know, it wasn'’t until
I was out of law school

21:07.379 --> 21:09.620
that I actually stopped
trying to fit in,

21:10.068 --> 21:11.275
and said to hell with
who my parents

21:11.413 --> 21:13.413
and everyone else
thought I should be.

21:13.827 --> 21:14.931
And you know what?

21:15.448 --> 21:17.793
I actually started to love
my unpredictable,

21:17.931 --> 21:20.965
stubborn, workaholic,
junk food-eating ass.

21:22.034 --> 21:23.896
How '‘bout you try just
being Vanessa?

21:24.482 --> 21:26.689
Personally, I think you'’ll find
she'’s pretty dope.

21:29.379 --> 21:32.206
Dope is usually not the first
word people use to describe me.

21:32.620 --> 21:35.241
Well, that is because most of
your friends are probably corny.

21:35.379 --> 21:39.000
Come on. Time to show these boys
how the big girls fight.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.896
"“The New Jim Crow
Alive & Well In New York?

21:45.034 --> 21:47.793
When Anthony Henry plead guilty
to felony marijuana possession

21:47.931 --> 21:50.103
in exchange for probation,
he began his descent

21:50.241 --> 21:51.965
into second-class citizenship"”.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.758
I'’ve been saying that for years.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.379
"“Anthony'’s felony conviction
prevents him from sitting

21:55.517 --> 21:58.689
on a jury and, in many states,
voting"”.

21:58.827 --> 22:01.655
- 63,000 views!
- No!

22:01.793 --> 22:03.275
Here'’s where you
bring it home, though:

22:03.413 --> 22:05.137
"“With one in three black men
crossing paths

22:05.275 --> 22:07.137
with the criminal justice system
at some point in their lives,

22:07.275 --> 22:10.034
this second class is growing
and undoing many of the gains

22:10.172 --> 22:12.551
of the Civil Rights movement.
If you act in violation

22:12.689 --> 22:14.517
of this new Jim Crow,
you suffer.

22:14.655 --> 22:17.517
This Anthony discovered when
he responded to a jury summons"”.

22:17.655 --> 22:20.310
Ooh, Tom is going to love this!

22:20.517 --> 22:23.310
The practice of jailing jurors
who lobby to acquit

22:23.448 --> 22:26.172
might have a chilling effect
on the jury room.

22:26.310 --> 22:28.448
Is Ms. Sullivan accusing
Judge Blackburn

22:28.586 --> 22:30.689
of intentionally
intimidating a juror?

22:30.827 --> 22:32.655
Your Honor, this piece
wasn'’t written by Ms. Sullivan.

22:32.793 --> 22:36.310
This may not be her byline,
but it sounds exactly like her.

22:36.448 --> 22:38.586
Did you guys check out some of
these comments? -

22:38.827 --> 22:42.103
"“Judge Blackburn'’s a witch
with a heart of stone...

22:42.241 --> 22:44.551
With teats as shriveled
as walnuts"”.

22:44.689 --> 22:47.206
You can'’t possibly
be holding us responsible

22:47.344 --> 22:49.862
for anonymous comments
on an article we didn'’t write.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.241
Look, Tom, you protect yours.
I protect mine.

22:53.655 --> 22:55.827
Which means your office
is about to seriously regret

22:55.965 --> 22:58.689
using the press to try
and strong-arm one of my judges.

23:09.172 --> 23:12.620
- So we good on the continuance?
- Two weeks? That'’s fine.

23:13.137 --> 23:14.413
Judge, the People consent

23:14.551 --> 23:16.034
to our request for
a two-week continuance.

23:16.172 --> 23:18.034
Sorry, I'’m sending you out
for trial.

23:18.172 --> 23:19.586
The People have their
offices here.

23:19.724 --> 23:21.103
Your Honor,
Mr. Kasden isn'’t available.

23:21.241 --> 23:23.000
- He'’s engaged in trial.
- Too bad.

23:23.137 --> 23:24.793
Get someone else
over here to try it.

23:24.931 --> 23:29.586
- Jury 5. Next case.
- Docket ending 845,

23:29.724 --> 23:32.551
People vs. Linda Curran.
Step up.

23:32.758 --> 23:34.655
This case is up for
a Huntley Hearing, Your Honor.

23:34.793 --> 23:37.448
Ms. Feynman is out sick and
requests a two-day continuance.

23:37.586 --> 23:38.965
You can do the hearing,
Counselor.

23:39.103 --> 23:40.517
I'’m not familiar with the case!

23:40.655 --> 23:42.551
So many excuses today.

23:43.448 --> 23:45.413
Here you go.
Your coffee, piping hot.

23:45.551 --> 23:48.586
Thanks. Listen, your case
is last on the docket.

23:48.724 --> 23:50.517
If I try to move it up,
I'’ll get my head chewed off.

23:50.655 --> 23:52.793
Come on, are you serious?
- That Examiner article?

23:52.931 --> 23:55.931
The judges are on a war path.
I wish I could help.

23:56.586 --> 23:58.000
Oh, also, the clerk
in arraignments

23:58.137 --> 23:59.758
has a client asking for you.

24:12.758 --> 24:15.586
He was arrested for marijuana
possession last night.

24:15.724 --> 24:16.931
Anthony!

24:17.068 --> 24:18.344
I'’m already
out on a limb for you!

24:18.482 --> 24:20.758
It was one joint.
It was stupid.

24:20.896 --> 24:23.965
And guess who has a copy of your
article with him on the bench?

24:24.965 --> 24:28.103
Docket ending 772
The People vs. Anthony Henry.

24:28.241 --> 24:29.379
Step up.

24:33.724 --> 24:36.758
Well, well.
Is that the Anthony Henry?

24:37.137 --> 24:38.517
Judge, may we approach?

24:40.275 --> 24:42.000
Looks like it'’s duck-hunting
season on you guys right now.

24:42.137 --> 24:43.655
Give it a rest, Patel.

24:47.103 --> 24:49.206
Judge, I'’m going to ask
that you ROR my client.

24:49.344 --> 24:51.655
Ms. Sullivan, there'’s no way
in God'’s holy creation

24:51.793 --> 24:53.689
- I'’m doing that.
- As I'’m sure you are aware,

24:53.827 --> 24:55.655
he has a matter
in front of Judge Blackburn.

24:56.172 --> 24:59.517
Oh, I'’m aware.
The whole building'’s aware.

25:01.689 --> 25:04.068
The People are offering 90 days
on the new drug case.

25:04.206 --> 25:06.551
- 90 days?
- I'’ll set $2,500 bail.

25:06.689 --> 25:09.724
- On a weed case?
- It'’s a very serious charge.

25:13.965 --> 25:17.931
Okay, 90 days to cover
the marijuana and the perjury.

25:18.068 --> 25:19.655
We haven'’t voted
on the perjury yet.

25:19.793 --> 25:21.517
You walk into Blackburn'’s
courtroom with a guilty plea

25:21.655 --> 25:24.034
on the perjury,
she is completely validated.

25:29.758 --> 25:33.206
Alright. But there'’s nothing
I can do on the contempt charge.

25:33.344 --> 25:35.724
That is between you
and the Judge.

25:47.689 --> 25:48.862
Good morning.

25:49.655 --> 25:52.172
In light of Mr. Henry'’s guilty
plea to the perjury charge

25:52.310 --> 25:55.931
in this case, I will dismiss
the contempt of court charge.

25:56.068 --> 25:58.724
He has taken responsibility
for his actions,

25:58.862 --> 26:00.275
and the court is satisfied.

26:00.413 --> 26:02.862
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- That being said, Ms. Sullivan,

26:03.000 --> 26:06.275
your behavior in this case
has been unpardonable.

26:06.827 --> 26:08.586
- Your Honor, how is that?
- Uh-uh!

26:09.172 --> 26:11.137
You have
a duty to defend your client,

26:11.275 --> 26:13.793
but, first, you are
an officer of this court

26:13.931 --> 26:17.793
and you must operate effectively
within the judicial system.

26:17.931 --> 26:20.793
Instead, you conspired

26:20.931 --> 26:24.655
to expose this court
to ridicule and mistrust.

26:25.344 --> 26:29.068
For that reason,
you are hereby banned

26:29.620 --> 26:32.206
from ever appearing before
or practicing law

26:32.344 --> 26:34.000
in front of me again.

26:36.620 --> 26:38.275
Your Honor...

26:40.793 --> 26:42.724
I appreciate the fact
that you acknowledge that

26:42.862 --> 26:44.931
in light of all that has
transpired between us,

26:45.068 --> 26:47.448
you cannot be fair
to either me or my client.

26:47.586 --> 26:49.275
- Oh no, actually--
- No, truly!

26:49.413 --> 26:51.551
- Ms. Sullivan, that is not--
- That you can be bigger woman

26:51.689 --> 26:54.689
and admit your bias
is truly exceptional.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.137
So let me commend and thank you.

27:00.310 --> 27:01.965
We are adjourned.

27:06.793 --> 27:09.275
- Anthony, I am so sorry.
- It'’s not your fault.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.620
Is there an official document
banning you, or something?

27:23.827 --> 27:25.137
I don'’t think so, why?

27:25.482 --> 27:28.000
'‘Cause I think I would like
a copy for inspiration

27:28.137 --> 27:30.344
as I write the first
Veronica Sullivan novel.

27:30.517 --> 27:32.379
Veronica? Is that her name?

27:32.551 --> 27:35.517
Yeah. It means
"“She who brings victory"”.

27:35.931 --> 27:37.517
Except I didn'’t win.
I lost.

27:37.793 --> 27:40.413
You fought for your client
like a mother-bear.

27:40.551 --> 27:44.379
- And that'’s what counts.
- Thank you.

27:48.103 --> 27:50.517
I should'’ve never answered
that jury summons.

27:51.413 --> 27:53.103
You did the right thing.

27:55.344 --> 27:58.172
Going'’ to jail,
for doing what'’s right.

27:59.241 --> 28:03.862
- It'’s crazy.
- I know it is.

28:19.758 --> 28:22.103
Look, I know this office
runs on gossip,

28:22.241 --> 28:24.172
so I want to get
to hear it from your first.

28:24.310 --> 28:25.931
- Blackburn had it coming--
- I'’m promoting Charlie

28:26.068 --> 28:27.310
to supervisor.

28:27.448 --> 28:29.310
Wait, what?
Because of Blackburn, seriously?

28:29.551 --> 28:31.034
You know her banning me
was just punishment

28:31.172 --> 28:32.827
for me recusing her
from my case, right?

28:32.965 --> 28:34.344
Which I told you not to do.

28:34.482 --> 28:36.482
Tom, she was gonna seriously
hurt my client!

28:36.620 --> 28:38.068
You didn'’t think it through!

28:38.620 --> 28:40.275
There was a full PD shutdown
because of it!

28:40.413 --> 28:41.965
- And you'’re blaming me?
- Of course I'’m blaming you!

28:42.103 --> 28:43.586
Tom, I went to bat
for my client!

28:43.724 --> 28:45.862
You are punishing me
for giving a shit.

28:46.413 --> 28:49.275
Charlie is damn good at his job
but nobody in this office

28:49.413 --> 28:52.310
works harder
or cares more than me!

28:57.413 --> 29:00.275
When you have tunnel vision,
you don'’t think things through.

29:00.724 --> 29:02.551
You get obsessed with something
and you pursue it

29:02.689 --> 29:04.241
with such
a single-minded purpose

29:04.379 --> 29:06.068
that you don'’t look
at the wreckage around you,

29:06.310 --> 29:08.896
what you'’re doing to yourself!
I see the crap that you eat.

29:09.137 --> 29:10.482
You over-extend yourself.

29:11.137 --> 29:12.931
And I know first-hand
what that does.

29:13.655 --> 29:15.172
You'’re slowly killing yourself.

29:15.310 --> 29:16.586
- But, Tom, that has nothing--
- There'’s no buts.

29:17.034 --> 29:18.931
You need to get a handle
on your life, kiddo.

29:46.344 --> 29:50.310
- I only have 15 minutes.
- This won'’t take that long.

29:50.827 --> 29:53.000
Don'’t undercut yourself, Mister.

29:53.724 --> 29:55.068
I just wanted you to know

29:55.206 --> 29:56.724
that I'’m not cheating
on Audrey anymore.

29:56.862 --> 29:58.344
Really?

29:58.724 --> 30:01.586
Well, what do you call this?

30:02.896 --> 30:05.275
I'’m not cheating on her
because I left her.

30:06.206 --> 30:08.689
- You what?
- Now we can really be together.

30:09.103 --> 30:10.275
Of course,
I'’ll have to recuse myself.

30:10.413 --> 30:12.413
What do you think this is,
exactly?

30:13.655 --> 30:14.965
A relationship.

30:17.137 --> 30:19.310
My daddy was a no-account
son of a bitch,

30:19.448 --> 30:21.931
but he taught me one thing
that turned out to be true:

30:22.068 --> 30:24.689
you don'’t look for love
where you look for sex.

30:25.586 --> 30:27.241
Why did you have
to mess this up?

30:35.758 --> 30:37.724
Well, listen, thanks so much
for coming by, Earl.

30:37.862 --> 30:39.586
- I really appreciate it.
- Dad?

30:41.896 --> 30:44.689
Gwen!
What are you doing here?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.137
I came to try to make things
right with Judge Blackburn.

30:48.275 --> 30:51.034
Well, your father already beat
you to it, Ms. Sullivan.

30:51.758 --> 30:54.103
And it'’s only because
I respect him so much

30:54.241 --> 30:59.000
I told him that
I would consider lifting my ban.

31:00.068 --> 31:02.137
Alright, Earl,
always great to see you.

31:02.275 --> 31:03.620
- Great to see you!
- You take care.

31:03.758 --> 31:04.689
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:04.827 --> 31:06.241
Thank you.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.000
Dad, exactly what do you think
you'’re doing here?

31:11.310 --> 31:13.103
Sweetheart, you were banned
from ever appearing

31:13.241 --> 31:15.275
before a judge again.
I was just trying to help.

31:15.413 --> 31:16.655
You weren'’t trying to help me!

31:16.793 --> 31:18.379
You were trying to help
your reputation.

31:18.551 --> 31:20.034
- That is not fair.
- You know you haven'’t set foot

31:20.172 --> 31:22.344
in this building to come
and see me in court,

31:22.586 --> 31:24.000
but you'll come here
to save face?

31:24.137 --> 31:26.137
Why is it that you can'’t
accept my help?

31:26.379 --> 31:28.241
You haven'’t even cashed
the check that I sent you.

31:28.379 --> 31:30.172
You didn'’t send it to me.
You sent it to my roommate.

31:30.310 --> 31:33.034
And I would appreciate it
if you did not get between us.

31:33.172 --> 31:36.275
- And I don'’t need your help.
- Obviously, you do.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.206
You know, you can'’t just throw

31:40.344 --> 31:41.586
your money and
your criticism around

31:41.724 --> 31:43.068
and call it parenting.

31:43.344 --> 31:45.931
It didn'’t work for David
and it won'’t work for me.

31:47.034 --> 31:48.344
Gwen!

32:13.241 --> 32:15.517
Hamilton Heights money
must be nice.

32:16.344 --> 32:18.896
You sure you'’re up for this?
After today?

32:19.034 --> 32:20.586
Yeah, you won. Congratulations.

32:20.724 --> 32:22.931
I'’m talking about
what happened with Blackburn.

32:23.310 --> 32:26.724
Oh, sorry.
Seriously, no gloating?

32:26.862 --> 32:29.000
Oh, I'’m gonna gloat.
Just later.

32:29.482 --> 32:31.724
It'’s no fun kicking you
when you'’re down.

32:36.724 --> 32:39.896
You really clean up nice.
You are killing that dress!

32:40.034 --> 32:41.689
- Thank you!
- Oh, you know what?

32:41.827 --> 32:44.310
- I saw that tag in the back.
- No, just... just tuck it!

32:45.413 --> 32:47.344
My people. My people.

32:47.655 --> 32:49.931
Gwen!
I heard you had a day.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.275
It means so much to us
that you could still make it.

32:52.413 --> 32:53.827
Oh, of course! Congratulations!

32:53.965 --> 32:55.931
Oh, no, no.
The invitation said no gifts.

32:56.068 --> 32:57.517
Yeah, but nobody ever
means that.

32:57.655 --> 32:59.103
We do. Donations only.

32:59.241 --> 33:01.275
To the Plentiful Hope
Children'’s Foundation.

33:01.586 --> 33:02.758
Excuse me.

33:03.551 --> 33:06.034
- Hey, glad you could make it!
- Bennet!

33:06.172 --> 33:08.379
- Charlie!
- Thank you for having us.

33:08.517 --> 33:09.586
Of course, of course.

33:15.068 --> 33:17.724
Okay.
Groom'’s most romantic spot.

33:17.862 --> 33:20.172
Oh, Montmartre! Next to the
Basilica du Sacré-Coeur,

33:20.310 --> 33:22.517
- in Paris, where he proposed.
- Aww.

33:22.655 --> 33:24.827
Correct!
His favorite drink?

33:24.965 --> 33:26.862
Oh! Captain and Coke
back in college!

33:27.000 --> 33:28.344
Bro. Where have you been?

33:28.965 --> 33:34.206
Now he likes big Italian reds.
I'’d say a Barolo like Massolino.

33:34.344 --> 33:36.482
Yes.
Favorite comfort food?

33:36.620 --> 33:38.137
Oh, my dairy-free
Mac and Cheese.

33:38.275 --> 33:41.103
- Chicken and waffles.
- Yes! Chicken and waffles!

33:41.275 --> 33:42.965
Baby, you don'’t even eat meat
anymore.

33:43.275 --> 33:44.862
A man can reminisce, can'’t he?

33:45.000 --> 33:47.517
What'’s the one thing Bennet
would save in a fire?

33:47.655 --> 33:49.517
- Photographs.
- His manuscripts.

33:49.655 --> 33:53.689
Gwen got it!
Favorite athlete of all time.

33:54.413 --> 33:56.344
- Oh, Michael Jordan!
- No, Bill Russell!

33:56.482 --> 33:58.000
Damn, girl, you'’re killing it!

33:58.137 --> 33:59.448
Hey, is she your sister
or something?

33:59.586 --> 34:00.965
'‘Cause that'’s cheating!

34:01.241 --> 34:04.068
What was the first car
Bennet drove?

34:04.206 --> 34:05.517
I don'’t even know.

34:05.655 --> 34:09.103
It was a 1974 Volkswagen
Karmann Ghia convertible,

34:09.241 --> 34:12.655
orange with grey interior,
four-speed.

34:13.931 --> 34:15.793
Shit! Shit!

34:17.137 --> 34:18.206
Sorry!

34:27.896 --> 34:29.620
Is this the bathroom?

34:42.000 --> 34:46.724
No gifts, huh? That'’s some
passive-aggressive bullshit.

35:24.241 --> 35:26.896
- I'’m sorry, uh...
- No, it'’s...

35:27.034 --> 35:29.413
It'’s okay. I spilled something
on my dress and...

35:30.793 --> 35:34.068
- We have a guest bathroom.
- I know, but...

35:41.000 --> 35:43.517
Bill Russell changed the face
of basketball.

35:43.655 --> 35:45.344
And you have always loved
chicken and waffles.

35:45.482 --> 35:46.724
And your orange Karmann Ghia!

35:46.862 --> 35:48.758
How does she not know
those things?

35:52.275 --> 35:54.241
And why not me, Bennet?

37:40.275 --> 37:43.103
Showing up the bride-to-be
must have been exhausting.

37:44.931 --> 37:46.965
- What'’s your problem?
- No, no problem.

37:47.103 --> 37:50.206
Just don'’t like being dragged
to some whack-ass bougie party

37:50.344 --> 37:52.413
- just so you could...
- What?

37:54.275 --> 37:56.310
Where did you disappear to,
anyway?

37:57.172 --> 37:59.517
- I was talking to other people.
- Who?

38:01.068 --> 38:03.620
- I was talking to Bennet.
- For that long?

38:06.310 --> 38:07.965
Ah, hell no.

38:08.931 --> 38:12.896
You had sex with him.
At the man'’s wedding shower!

38:13.034 --> 38:15.310
That'’s cold.
Even I wouldn'’t do that.

38:16.482 --> 38:17.793
It was a bad choice.

38:17.931 --> 38:19.931
You are the queen
of bad choices.

38:20.448 --> 38:23.448
Buy clothes you can'’t afford,
not paying your bills,

38:23.896 --> 38:25.413
getting banned by a judge...

38:25.620 --> 38:27.275
Maybe that'’s why Tom
didn'’t make you supervisor.

38:27.413 --> 38:28.931
[bleep] you, Charlie.

38:29.068 --> 38:30.758
Pull the car over, please.
I don'’t need this shit.

38:48.551 --> 38:50.137
Hey, Sharon, it'’s me.

38:51.344 --> 38:54.758
Yeah, I remember.
What are you doing tonight?

40:05.896 --> 40:07.551
Next time on In Contempt:

40:07.689 --> 40:10.413
There'’s obviously unfinished
business between the two of you.

40:10.551 --> 40:12.758
I want you to finish it.
I'’m giving you 30 days.

40:12.896 --> 40:15.413
Pack a bag.
That 30 days starts right now.

40:15.551 --> 40:17.103
I'’ve been stopped like 40 times.

40:17.241 --> 40:19.379
- Excuse me?
- Three times by this same cop.

40:19.551 --> 40:22.344
That cop stopped my client for
no other reason than he'’s black!

40:22.482 --> 40:25.379
You know it, I know it,
and she knows it.

40:25.758 --> 40:28.241
Holy shit! Tessa?

40:28.379 --> 40:30.344
Oh, I just saw on Twitter
you got engaged!

40:30.482 --> 40:32.379
This must be your fiancée.
Alison?

40:32.517 --> 40:34.586
No, actually, this is my sister.
