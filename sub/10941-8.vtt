<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.702 --> 00:03.671
You sold Tim
a racehorse?

00:04.773 --> 00:05.638
I didn't sell him
a racehorse.

00:05.705 --> 00:07.407
I sold him a bit
of a headache.

00:07.475 --> 00:11.311
Guess who's jam is hitting
a supermarket shelf near you?

00:11.379 --> 00:12.579
Heartland.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.782
It's your mom.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.885
Actually, Ty's hardly mentioned
anything about you at all.

00:18.953 --> 00:21.153
I had nowhere else to go.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.457
It's Wade.
He's found me.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.961
Stay in the truck, mom!

00:29.028 --> 00:31.530
What're you doing here, Wade?

00:31.598 --> 00:34.166
Hey,
it's a family reunion.

00:39.037 --> 00:41.739
Turn around, get back
in your car and leave.

00:41.807 --> 00:42.707
Ty...

00:44.009 --> 00:46.077
I can handle this.
I can handle this.

00:46.145 --> 00:47.212
Yeah, come on, Ty.

00:47.279 --> 00:48.546
I'm not looking
for any trouble.

00:48.614 --> 00:50.148
I don't give a damn
what you're looking for.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.816
Turn around and go.

00:59.124 --> 01:01.958
Man, what happened to us,
huh?

01:04.795 --> 01:08.064
You know,
it's all ancient history.

01:09.366 --> 01:10.933
I'm just here
to talk to your mom.

01:11.001 --> 01:12.268
Yeah?

01:12.336 --> 01:13.436
Well, maybe she doesn't
want to talk to you.

01:13.504 --> 01:15.338
So leave. Now!

01:15.405 --> 01:16.539
We're all adults here,
right?

01:16.607 --> 01:18.274
You're all grown up now.
Look at you.

01:20.110 --> 01:21.744
What do you say
we make a fresh start?

01:21.811 --> 01:24.180
You've got ten seconds.

01:30.553 --> 01:31.520
All right.

01:33.122 --> 01:34.422
Okay.

01:34.490 --> 01:36.391
Baby steps then,
right?

01:40.263 --> 01:42.396
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

01:42.464 --> 01:43.364
<i>Ty?</i>

01:44.466 --> 01:46.167
Who's that guy?
Is everything okay?

01:50.038 --> 01:51.238
Yeah.

01:51.939 --> 01:54.475
It's just some guy
who took a wrong turn.

01:54.543 --> 01:56.377
He's goin' now.

01:56.444 --> 01:59.345
I told you
I could handle this.

02:15.528 --> 02:16.562
Is everybody okay?

02:22.868 --> 02:24.636
that Ty has
an evil step dad?

02:24.704 --> 02:26.438
The lunatic that
ran me off the road?

02:26.506 --> 02:27.839
That was nothing.

02:27.907 --> 02:29.174
They looked like they were
about to kill each other.

02:29.241 --> 02:30.174
Where is Ty?

02:30.242 --> 02:31.442
With his mom.

02:31.510 --> 02:32.810
'Kay, I gotta
go talk to him.

02:32.877 --> 02:35.246
Maybe you should
just give 'em a moment.

02:36.582 --> 02:37.548
It was so intense.

02:37.616 --> 02:38.849
I thought Ty was
gonna lose it.

02:42.387 --> 02:43.721
<i>I swear.</i>

02:43.788 --> 02:45.455
I haven't spoken to him
in months.

02:45.523 --> 02:47.691
Are you sure about that?

02:47.758 --> 02:49.226
We're in the middle
of nowhere, Mom.

02:49.293 --> 02:50.227
So, unless you said something,
there's no way he could've-

02:50.294 --> 02:51.261
<i>Ty?</i>

02:51.329 --> 02:52.629
Not now, Amy!

02:57.501 --> 02:58.735
Okay. I don't know,

02:58.802 --> 03:00.537
maybe I did mention you were
working here sometime.

03:00.605 --> 03:01.704
At Heartland?

03:02.772 --> 03:04.072
Mom, they have a website

03:04.140 --> 03:05.140
with a phone number
and an address.

03:05.208 --> 03:07.075
There's even a map
on there!

03:07.143 --> 03:09.111
It doesn't matter.

03:10.780 --> 03:13.048
He would have
found me anyhow.

03:13.116 --> 03:16.252
He's never gonna
leave me alone.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.575
You know, when I was a kid
living in Vancouver,

03:41.643 --> 03:42.643
there was this park
just down the street

03:42.744 --> 03:45.145
from where I lived.

03:45.212 --> 03:46.613
And there was this tree
I used to climb,

03:46.681 --> 03:50.616
and I uh...
I built a tree fort in it

03:51.618 --> 03:55.954
so I could take my mom
some place safe to live.

03:57.824 --> 04:00.293
Somewhere away from Wade.

04:02.529 --> 04:04.997
Amy, would you stop
doing that?

04:06.432 --> 04:09.501
Amy, look at me for a second.
I'm leaving, okay?

04:09.568 --> 04:12.304
I'm taking my mom
back to Vancouver.

04:12.371 --> 04:13.338
When?

04:13.406 --> 04:14.472
Right now.

05:00.115 --> 05:01.282
How long is he going for?

05:01.351 --> 05:03.918
He doesn't know.
He didn't say.

05:03.986 --> 05:05.253
What about university?

05:05.321 --> 05:06.455
He told me it's gotta wait.

05:06.522 --> 05:07.823
That this is something
he has to do.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.224
Grampa, I know he's making
a mistake.

05:10.291 --> 05:11.959
She is his mother, Amy.

05:12.026 --> 05:13.494
Then why can't she see
that this is completely

05:13.562 --> 05:15.563
the wrong thing to do?

05:27.307 --> 05:29.576
If you're trying to talk me out of this, Jack,
don't bother. I've made up my mind.

05:29.643 --> 05:32.245
Yeah, well, you see,
th's the problem.

05:32.312 --> 05:34.313
Because your mind doesn't
seem to be working

05:34.382 --> 05:35.682
too well right now.

05:35.716 --> 05:38.351
I know what I'm doing.

05:38.419 --> 05:40.854
Yeah? And what's that?

05:40.921 --> 05:42.721
Other than putting
your life on hold.

05:44.858 --> 05:46.592
My mom says she can
deal with Wade,

05:46.659 --> 05:47.726
but that's exactly
what she used to say

05:47.827 --> 05:48.994
when I was a kid.

05:49.061 --> 05:52.097
Ty, your mom's a lot safer
here with us

05:52.164 --> 05:53.632
than in Vancouver.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.467
Now she's welcome to stay
in the house

05:55.535 --> 05:59.069
for as long as she likes -
in Marion's room.

05:59.137 --> 06:00.337
I appreciate the offer,
Jack,

06:00.406 --> 06:03.107
but she's my responsibility,
not yours.

06:03.174 --> 06:06.110
That's a steaming pile
of bull.

06:06.177 --> 06:07.978
Now, you're the next closest
thing to family,

06:08.046 --> 06:12.049
and when family's in trouble,
we stick together.

06:12.367 --> 06:13.367
Huh?

06:14.869 --> 06:17.303
Nobody's going anywhere.

06:19.006 --> 06:22.275
To make sure of that,
I'm gonna lock the gate.

06:27.381 --> 06:30.049
I feel terrible about this,
Lou.

06:30.116 --> 06:32.284
I've dragged my dirty laundry
right up to your doorstep.

06:32.318 --> 06:33.819
Don't  be silly,
okay?

06:33.887 --> 06:35.020
You're gonna be much more
comfortable here

06:35.088 --> 06:36.621
than at the dude ranch.

06:36.940 --> 06:37.973
And the clincher?

06:38.041 --> 06:39.574
Indoor plumbing.

06:39.642 --> 06:40.642
Okay.

06:42.345 --> 06:44.413
but only for a few days.

06:45.315 --> 06:47.514
Now, I don't want anyone
going outta their way.

06:47.582 --> 06:49.716
Hey, I promise.
You can make your own bed,

06:49.784 --> 06:51.485
<i>do your own laundry.</i>

06:51.586 --> 06:53.821
You can help with dinner
if you're up to it, okay?

06:53.888 --> 06:55.656
Thanks.

06:55.723 --> 06:58.859
Cause I don't want
your pity, Lou.

06:58.893 --> 06:59.893
Ok.

07:02.229 --> 07:05.165
Not all the years
with Wade were bad.

07:06.067 --> 07:09.269
In fact, some of them
were pretty good.

07:10.104 --> 07:13.706
When he had money,
he treated me pretty well.

07:14.741 --> 07:16.443
And when he didn't...

07:17.711 --> 07:20.579
One day he went out
for a part for his car.

07:20.646 --> 07:22.114
I packed my bags
and I left.

07:26.052 --> 07:27.420
Okay.

07:27.952 --> 07:29.220
No pity.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.255
Amy?

08:05.323 --> 08:06.788
<i>Amy, can I come in?</i>

08:06.856 --> 08:08.290
What time is it?

08:08.358 --> 08:10.859
Hey. It's early.

08:13.163 --> 08:15.097
I just wanted to talk to you
before um...

08:15.165 --> 08:16.732
Before I left
for the track.

08:16.799 --> 08:20.236
I know I freaked out yesterday,
seeing Wade.

08:20.303 --> 08:21.637
<i>Maybe Jack's right,</i>

08:21.704 --> 08:23.371
maybe she will be safer here
than anywhere else.

08:23.439 --> 08:25.373
I just... hate to leave.

08:27.376 --> 08:31.812
Hey... don't worry.
We'll keep an eye on her.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.015
Go to work.

08:36.919 --> 08:37.919
There's one more thing.

08:37.986 --> 08:39.919
Mmm...

08:39.986 --> 08:40.720
No.

08:40.788 --> 08:41.755
Come on.

08:41.822 --> 08:42.589
I have morning breath.

08:42.657 --> 08:43.957
I don't care.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.762
I don't believe it.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.398
Jack actually did lock
the gate.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.773
- See ya.
- 'Kay.

09:11.317 --> 09:13.151
You Amy Fleming?

09:13.219 --> 09:15.120
- Yes.
- Clay Dawson.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.189
You look pretty young
to be a horse whisperer.

09:18.624 --> 09:21.492
Well, I work with horses.
No whispering though.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.026
My son Cody,

09:23.095 --> 09:24.962
his roping horse has been
acting up.

09:25.029 --> 09:27.064
Now the vet says there's nothing wrong,
but like I told Jack,

09:27.132 --> 09:28.365
we gotta get him fixed up

09:28.433 --> 09:30.501
for the rodeo in Strathmore
this weekend.

09:30.569 --> 09:31.602
This weekend?

09:31.669 --> 09:33.971
That doesn't give me
much time.

09:34.038 --> 09:36.239
It's all we got.

09:36.307 --> 09:38.341
<i>Cody's older brother
is three-time all-round cowboy,</i>

09:38.409 --> 09:39.342
<i>and uh...</i>

09:39.410 --> 09:42.445
Cody aims to catch up
real fast.

09:42.513 --> 09:46.048
Okay. I'll do the best I can.

09:46.117 --> 09:47.683
Hey, uh...

09:47.751 --> 09:49.419
Whenever you have time
is fine with me.

09:49.487 --> 09:51.521
It doesn't have to be
by the weekend.

09:51.589 --> 09:53.522
What about the rodeo?

09:53.590 --> 09:56.525
There's always another rodeo.

09:58.961 --> 10:00.129
<i>Picture it, Grampa.</i>

10:00.196 --> 10:01.896
Heartland Jam
in grocery stores

10:01.964 --> 10:04.399
across the country!

10:04.467 --> 10:05.601
<i>I mean, yeah,</i>

10:05.668 --> 10:07.269
<i>so far it's only
in one store.</i>

10:07.337 --> 10:10.070
In Hudson.
But that's just a start.

10:10.139 --> 10:10.838
<i>Oh, hey, Lily.</i>

10:10.905 --> 10:11.672
Hey.

10:11.740 --> 10:12.673
Let me get you a coffee.

10:12.741 --> 10:13.574
<i>No, no.</i>

10:13.642 --> 10:14.675
Please, let me get it.

10:14.743 --> 10:15.809
I don't wanna interrupt.

10:15.877 --> 10:16.944
Oh, you're not interrupting.

10:17.012 --> 10:18.412
Grampa is just being
close-minded

10:18.480 --> 10:20.047
about my business plans.

10:20.115 --> 10:22.517
Just thought I was running
a horse ranch,

10:22.584 --> 10:24.084
not a gift shop,
is all.

10:24.152 --> 10:25.918
It's called branding.

10:25.986 --> 10:27.820
It's not the kind
of branding I'm used to.

10:27.888 --> 10:28.988
Look, Grampa,

10:29.056 --> 10:30.157
when you're developing
a business,

10:30.224 --> 10:31.724
you have to think big.

10:31.792 --> 10:33.527
One day I'm gonna be
serving Heartland Jam

10:33.594 --> 10:34.727
in the new dining lodge.

10:34.795 --> 10:36.763
What new dining lodge?

10:36.830 --> 10:38.665
The one I'm planning
to build.

10:38.732 --> 10:40.699
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna
have to find a bigger space

10:40.767 --> 10:42.434
if I want to keep up
with customer demand.

10:42.502 --> 10:45.237
If you can find more
space around here,

10:45.305 --> 10:47.739
fine,
you show it to me.

10:50.544 --> 10:51.743
What?

10:51.811 --> 10:53.745
You two.
You're so much alike.

11:04.423 --> 11:05.923
Come on, baby,
come on.

11:07.059 --> 11:08.193
Hey, Tim.

11:08.260 --> 11:09.427
I didn't know you were
a betting man.

11:09.495 --> 11:11.196
Only on a sure thing,
Scott.

11:11.263 --> 11:13.163
Check this bay out.

11:13.231 --> 11:16.266
<i>The front-runner-
"Lightning Dexter."</i>

11:16.334 --> 11:17.501
Hey, that's Lisa's horse,
isn't it?

11:17.569 --> 11:18.435
Used to be.

11:19.604 --> 11:21.505
She didn't have the faith
in it I have.

11:21.573 --> 11:22.772
Lisa sold him to you?

11:22.840 --> 11:24.274
Yeah, you could say that,

11:24.342 --> 11:26.610
but I think I got the deal
of the century.

11:26.678 --> 11:28.711
Check that time out.

11:28.778 --> 11:29.778
Whoa.

11:29.846 --> 11:31.747
You could have a winner
on your hands.

11:31.815 --> 11:35.117
I wouldn't get too excited.
It's just an exercise run.

11:35.185 --> 11:36.319
For all you know

11:36.386 --> 11:38.153
the other rider's
holding his horse back.

11:38.222 --> 11:39.288
Trying to psych me out, Lisa?

11:39.356 --> 11:40.989
Yeah. Working?

11:43.126 --> 11:46.661
Lightning wasn't my first horse
or my only horse.

11:46.729 --> 11:49.097
That one out there
running with yours -

11:49.164 --> 11:50.665
<i>"Alberta Comet" -</i>

11:50.733 --> 11:52.033
that's mine, too.

11:52.735 --> 11:55.337
You're gonna remember his name.

11:55.404 --> 11:57.505
Well, looks like we're off
to the races.

11:57.573 --> 11:58.540
Yes, it does.

11:59.742 --> 12:00.641
Good luck.

12:08.265 --> 12:09.332
Hey, Allegro.

12:10.067 --> 12:12.536
That's Cody Dawson's
roping horse, right?

12:12.604 --> 12:14.070
Yeah.
I'm gonna need your help with him.

12:14.138 --> 12:15.739
What's the problem?

12:15.807 --> 12:17.507
Well, Cody's dad says
that his time's off.

12:17.574 --> 12:19.174
That he's slow
out of the box.

12:19.242 --> 12:20.510
Tell me about it.

12:20.577 --> 12:21.911
What do you mean?

12:21.979 --> 12:22.945
Well...

12:23.013 --> 12:24.013
You know how I've been on

12:24.080 --> 12:25.114
a bit of a winning streak
lately?

12:25.181 --> 12:27.517
Stavely, Innisfail,
High River...

12:27.584 --> 12:29.819
Yes, Caleb,
we all know about it.

12:29.887 --> 12:31.153
The thing is,
the Dawson brothers

12:31.221 --> 12:33.755
were most of the reason
I wasn't doing so good before.

12:33.823 --> 12:36.725
Then Travis had a wreck.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.527
Cody's horse started
coming up short.

12:38.594 --> 12:40.762
It's like somebody put some
bad mojo on those boys.

12:40.830 --> 12:42.230
Oh, mojo?

12:42.297 --> 12:43.464
I don't know.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.433
I don't nothin' about
any Voodoo hooey dooey.

12:47.537 --> 12:51.471
Wow. I thought my mom
was a pack rat.

12:51.540 --> 12:53.440
It's a win-win
situation, Grampa.

12:53.508 --> 12:54.909
As soon as we get all this junk
outta here,

12:54.976 --> 12:56.710
you can have
the kitchen back and...

12:56.778 --> 12:57.878
I'll set up out here.

12:57.946 --> 13:00.014
This junk is my junk.

13:00.081 --> 13:01.248
It's not going anywhere.

13:01.315 --> 13:02.850
<i>Grampa, we had an agreement.</i>

13:02.918 --> 13:07.420
No, Lou, you had an idea
about taking over my shop.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.322
And I'm trying
to accommodate you.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.624
You want to accommodate me?

13:11.692 --> 13:12.892
How about you back up
your truck into here

13:12.960 --> 13:14.761
and take all this junk
to the dump?

13:14.828 --> 13:17.129
Hey, one man's junk
is another man's treasure.

13:18.432 --> 13:19.799
Hey.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.934
There's nothing wrong
with that radio.

13:22.001 --> 13:25.537
It just needs a couple
wires probably.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.175
You guys have a piano!

13:30.242 --> 13:32.544
Yeah, it's been sitting there
collecting dust

13:32.612 --> 13:35.246
ever since my great grandma
used to play it.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.881
Or was it my great-great
grandma?

13:36.949 --> 13:39.216
Well, if nobody plays it,
why don't you just sell it?

13:39.284 --> 13:41.819
The piano is staying!

13:47.492 --> 13:48.726
I bet I know who that is.

14:14.383 --> 14:15.350
Yes!

14:16.786 --> 14:18.320
Magic hands.

14:20.389 --> 14:22.491
What do you think that was -
five, six seconds, tops?

14:22.558 --> 14:24.692
This is not about you,
Caleb.

14:24.760 --> 14:25.727
Okay, fine.

14:27.329 --> 14:29.130
There's nothing wrong
with this horse.

14:29.197 --> 14:30.297
Matter of fact,
horse this good,

14:30.365 --> 14:33.134
I don't see  why Cody's still
not beating me.

14:35.754 --> 14:37.488
I can't do it, Wade.

14:37.555 --> 14:40.657
No, I don't know how
to make it any clearer.

14:41.725 --> 14:42.658
No!

14:44.728 --> 14:46.963
No, that's not part
of the deal.

14:48.032 --> 14:50.300
You have to stop
calling me.

14:53.204 --> 14:54.170
Okay.

14:55.439 --> 14:56.373
Okay.

14:56.573 --> 14:57.572
Five minutes.

14:58.608 --> 14:59.574
Just this once.

15:00.810 --> 15:03.312
Yeah, that's all I'm asking,
Lily.

15:04.447 --> 15:06.815
I'll be the guy
drinking coffee.

15:06.883 --> 15:07.883
Okay.

15:26.180 --> 15:27.814
Garbage.

15:27.882 --> 15:29.750
Keeper!

15:29.817 --> 15:31.518
Is there something
you're not telling us, Jack?

15:32.887 --> 15:34.920
I bet this must've meant
something to someone.

15:34.988 --> 15:36.221
My gum holder!

15:38.992 --> 15:41.193
Amy made that for my birthday.

15:41.261 --> 15:43.328
She was only about
six years-old.

15:43.396 --> 15:46.899
It started out as a sugar bowl,
but it kinda shrunk.

15:46.967 --> 15:48.768
<i>That's a keeper.</i>

15:51.370 --> 15:52.771
I remember, one year,

15:52.838 --> 15:54.806
Ty made me this little house
out of Popsicle sticks

15:54.874 --> 15:55.874
for mother's day.

15:55.941 --> 15:57.375
Aw, little Ty did that?

15:57.442 --> 15:58.509
Yeah.

15:58.577 --> 15:59.811
He even made
the furniture inside.

15:59.879 --> 16:03.048
Cool.
Do you still have it?

16:03.115 --> 16:05.984
I wish.
We moved around a lot.

16:06.685 --> 16:09.153
See, Lou,
some things are worth keeping.

16:09.220 --> 16:11.689
Yeah. Okay, that's
what the keeper box is for!

16:13.091 --> 16:15.525
Hey, Ty, you got a minute?

16:17.762 --> 16:19.930
How'd you like to make
a few extra bucks?

16:19.998 --> 16:21.165
Doing what?

16:21.232 --> 16:22.599
Well, I don't want to take
any chances

16:22.667 --> 16:26.069
with my four-legged money-maker
before tomorrow's race.

16:26.136 --> 16:27.103
You want me to keep
an eye on him for you?

16:27.171 --> 16:29.872
Yeah.
For the whole night.

16:29.940 --> 16:31.340
The whole night?

16:31.408 --> 16:32.775
Yeah, I don't want anybody
tampering with him, you know?

16:32.843 --> 16:34.010
People have pulled
all kinds of scams.

16:34.078 --> 16:35.011
They tranq horses,

16:35.079 --> 16:36.946
they stuff sponges
up their noses,

16:37.014 --> 16:38.447
nails in their hooves.

16:38.515 --> 16:39.447
Well, I'd like
to help you out,

16:39.515 --> 16:40.782
but my mom's still in town,

16:40.850 --> 16:42.984
and I should really be
at home with her, so...

16:43.052 --> 16:44.152
Your mom?

16:45.321 --> 16:46.354
Come on.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.024
This is for one night,
more or less.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.392
What do you say?
I'll make it worth your while.

16:51.460 --> 16:52.160
Cash.

16:52.228 --> 16:53.195
Money.

17:08.609 --> 17:11.243
No, don't worry about it, Ty.

17:11.310 --> 17:15.013
Hey, your mom is perfectly safe
here with us.

17:15.082 --> 17:16.482
Yes.

17:16.550 --> 17:19.986
And you know you can use
the extra money.

17:20.855 --> 17:23.790
Yeah, no, I'll grab something
at Maggie's for dinner.

17:23.858 --> 17:25.491
It'll be fun.

17:25.559 --> 17:27.592
Okay, bye.

17:42.742 --> 17:44.575
Wow.

17:44.643 --> 17:45.843
Don't stop on my account.

17:46.945 --> 17:48.379
It's a nice piano.

17:48.446 --> 17:50.014
It needs some tuning, though.

17:50.082 --> 17:53.484
Well, you're the first person
to play it in years.

17:53.551 --> 17:55.787
It's way better than the
one I used to play at school.

17:55.854 --> 18:00.023
I could ask my sister.
Maybe it's for sale.

18:00.091 --> 18:02.392
Forget it.
Not gonna happen.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.995
My dad's got my schedule
pretty well figured out

18:05.062 --> 18:08.398
and it doesn't include
playing the piano.

18:09.267 --> 18:12.468
I'm telling you, that
damn horse I sold Tim...

18:12.536 --> 18:14.304
Left my Comet in the dust.

18:14.371 --> 18:16.272
Oh, it was just a training run,
wasn't it?

18:16.339 --> 18:18.874
And I told him that.
But I was keeping track.

18:18.942 --> 18:21.643
He actually shaved two seconds
off his previous best.

18:22.679 --> 18:25.214
and that smirk on his face!

18:25.282 --> 18:27.316
Money-eating grin.

18:27.383 --> 18:30.286
That horse may have
a lot going for it,

18:30.353 --> 18:33.487
but it also has one
big liability -

18:34.523 --> 18:36.291
Tim Flemming.

18:36.358 --> 18:38.492
You see?
I'm glad I came over.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.994
I knew you'd give me
a reason to smile.

18:41.030 --> 18:42.030
I have to go.

18:43.132 --> 18:44.665
What is all this stuff?

18:45.835 --> 18:48.368
Ah, Lou's been going
a little overboard

18:48.436 --> 18:49.870
cleaning out
the Quonset hut.

18:49.938 --> 18:52.372
I managed to pry
a few precious items

18:52.440 --> 18:54.541
out of her cold-hearted
hands.

18:54.608 --> 18:57.277
I guess that would
explain the mug.

18:59.413 --> 19:02.682
And I thought it was
our little secret.

19:02.750 --> 19:03.582
Bye.

19:08.588 --> 19:09.755
Hey, you know Caleb,
right?

19:09.823 --> 19:10.923
I thought he could
give us a hand,

19:10.991 --> 19:12.325
so I can see how
your horse goes.

19:12.392 --> 19:13.492
Hey, Cody.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.694
Hey, man.
I didn't know you worked here.

19:15.762 --> 19:17.629
Oh, just part-time,

19:17.697 --> 19:20.131
so I can kick your butt
at the rodeo.

19:20.199 --> 19:23.001
I haven't noticed too much
butt kicking, O'Dell.

19:23.069 --> 19:24.702
This might be
your lucky weekend.

19:24.770 --> 19:27.205
My horse is not into it.

19:27.273 --> 19:28.874
Really? Your horse?

19:28.941 --> 19:30.208
'Cause as a matter of fact,
when I worked-

19:30.276 --> 19:31.376
You know what?

19:31.443 --> 19:32.710
Now that we've got
this all settled,

19:32.778 --> 19:35.145
let's get started, huh?

19:35.981 --> 19:37.614
He's a little jumpy.

19:38.716 --> 19:40.317
I don't think he likes
the quad.

19:40.385 --> 19:42.286
<i>Ah, he'll get used to it
after a few runs.</i>

19:42.354 --> 19:43.453
Yeah, I guess.

19:59.436 --> 20:01.304
Told you.
He's spooked by that thing.

20:01.372 --> 20:04.073
Well, see, I don't know
if that's the problem.

20:04.141 --> 20:05.775
That's 'cause
you weren't riding him.

20:05.842 --> 20:07.709
I don't wanna push it.

20:07.777 --> 20:09.778
I don't think that
this is gonna help.

20:09.845 --> 20:11.579
Hey, Cody.
Why don't we switch places?

20:11.647 --> 20:14.482
Maybe I can show you
how it's done.

20:15.351 --> 20:17.786
Caleb, I think we're gonna
call it quits for today.

20:23.125 --> 20:25.826
I hear your brother
had a real bad wreck.

20:25.894 --> 20:28.729
Just one of those things.

20:28.797 --> 20:30.731
What happened?

20:30.799 --> 20:32.699
Got good and close
to the calf,

20:32.767 --> 20:34.101
threw the loop perfect,

20:34.169 --> 20:36.570
but the slack got wrapped
around his hand.

20:36.638 --> 20:37.671
You could hear
the bones snapping

20:37.739 --> 20:38.872
all the way back
in the chutes.

20:38.940 --> 20:41.607
God, it's got to make
you think, huh?

20:41.675 --> 20:43.343
Guys get wracked up
all the time.

20:43.411 --> 20:44.877
It's just part
of the sport.

20:44.946 --> 20:46.179
Yeah, but...

20:46.247 --> 20:47.314
I mean, if something like
that happened to you,

20:47.381 --> 20:49.582
you wouldn't be able
to play piano.

20:49.650 --> 20:51.717
What are talking about?

20:51.785 --> 20:54.454
I don't even have a piano.

20:54.521 --> 20:57.556
See, the thing is,
Cody,

20:57.623 --> 20:59.658
I don't think there's
anything wrong with your horse.

20:59.725 --> 21:03.595
I mean, Caleb roped off him
and he had no problems.

21:03.663 --> 21:04.964
Well, I guess he's just
a better roper than I am.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.398
No! Caleb's good,

21:06.466 --> 21:09.168
but he's definitely
no better than you are.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.703
The only difference is
he wants to win.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.638
And I don't?

21:14.706 --> 21:18.109
I saw the way you were hanging
on your horse's mouth.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.177
You were holding him back

21:19.244 --> 21:20.078
so you didn't get
a decent throw.

21:20.145 --> 21:21.279
That's total crap.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.847
I didn't hire you
to tell me how to rope.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.383
I hired you to fix my horse.
End of story.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.721
Hey, cowboy,
I need a ride into town.

21:31.789 --> 21:33.556
Are you going that way?

21:33.624 --> 21:34.757
Uh, sure.
Hop in.

21:34.825 --> 21:35.792
Thanks.

21:44.101 --> 21:45.668
You know, I don't get it,
Grampa.

21:45.736 --> 21:47.904
Anyone can see that Cody just
doesn't want to rope any more,

21:47.972 --> 21:49.772
if he ever did
in the first place.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.441
Well, his dad was just
coming up

21:52.510 --> 21:54.777
during my last couple
of years of rodeo.

21:54.845 --> 21:57.780
Tough SOB.,
I'll tell you that.

21:57.848 --> 21:59.948
Drove his sons hard too.

22:00.016 --> 22:02.150
Got 'em on a horse
before they could walk.

22:02.218 --> 22:03.251
They learned to rope

22:03.319 --> 22:04.620
before they learned to read
and write.

22:04.937 --> 22:07.906
So, if you're a Dawson kid,

22:07.974 --> 22:09.574
playing the piano's
out of the question?

22:09.642 --> 22:10.675
Gotta be tough

22:10.743 --> 22:11.676
taking the road
less travelled

22:11.744 --> 22:13.278
in that family.

22:13.345 --> 22:15.380
I heard him play,
and, I mean,

22:15.447 --> 22:17.581
he was just fooling around,
but he was really good.

22:17.649 --> 22:18.682
Better than he was
at roping that dummy,

22:18.750 --> 22:20.384
that's for sure.

22:20.451 --> 22:23.220
Well, I'd hate to be the one
to tell his daddy that.

22:27.192 --> 22:29.459
Oh, come on, Amy.

22:29.527 --> 22:32.328
You know how I feel
about getting involved

22:32.396 --> 22:34.230
in other family's problems.

22:34.298 --> 22:36.666
Yes, but you're so good at it,
Grampa.

22:36.733 --> 22:38.802
Don't stop now.

23:06.862 --> 23:08.329
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:08.396 --> 23:09.530
What happened to takeout?

23:09.597 --> 23:11.098
I'm starving.

23:12.134 --> 23:13.801
What's wrong?

23:13.869 --> 23:17.338
Promise you won't do
anything stupid.

23:17.405 --> 23:18.339
Okay...

23:18.406 --> 23:20.073
No, Ty, really promise me,
please?

23:20.141 --> 23:21.708
Come on, Amy.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.110
I just saw
your mom and Wade.

23:24.178 --> 23:25.145
They were going into a bar

23:25.213 --> 23:28.114
just down the street
from Maggie's.

23:28.182 --> 23:29.582
A bar?

23:29.650 --> 23:30.416
Are you sure
it was my mom?

23:30.517 --> 23:31.517
Yeah.

23:32.586 --> 23:33.686
Ty!

23:33.754 --> 23:36.822
Hey, you just promised
like one second ago!

23:36.890 --> 23:38.824
You don't know
this guy Wade, Amy.

23:40.994 --> 23:43.362
'Kay. Here.
I'll stay here

23:43.429 --> 23:44.696
and cover for you,
but Ty-

23:44.764 --> 23:47.066
I promise! Nothing stupid.

23:50.744 --> 23:51.845
Well, I have to admit,

23:51.846 --> 23:54.747
I never thought I'd see you
drinking black coffee in a bar.

23:54.815 --> 23:56.249
Hmm.

23:56.317 --> 23:58.118
Well, spending a year alone
without the woman you love

23:58.186 --> 24:01.853
gives you a little time
to reprioritize things.

24:02.221 --> 24:03.989
I actually quit drinking.

24:05.391 --> 24:06.058
You...

24:06.226 --> 24:09.227
Yeah.
I quit gambling,

24:09.295 --> 24:12.030
kicked the pills,
got a job.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.533
Oh yeah.

24:15.602 --> 24:18.368
What is this?
One day at a time?

24:18.436 --> 24:19.570
Did you go to rehab?

24:19.638 --> 24:21.706
No, no.

24:21.773 --> 24:23.874
Just inner strength.

24:25.677 --> 24:27.277
I wish I could
say the same.

24:27.345 --> 24:29.313
I think you could.

24:29.380 --> 24:32.016
I mean, look at you,
you've changed too -

24:32.084 --> 24:33.350
your face,

24:34.719 --> 24:36.753
and the way you dress,

24:36.821 --> 24:39.522
the way you carry yourself.

24:41.058 --> 24:43.660
You're beautiful, Lily.

24:43.728 --> 24:46.730
I can't let you
slip away again.

24:52.836 --> 24:53.769
You have a way
of doing this to me.

24:53.837 --> 24:56.105
You keep sucking me
back in.

24:57.340 --> 24:59.341
Well, we've got a connection,
right?

25:00.877 --> 25:04.713
Yeah, it sounds a little bit
corny, doesn't it?

25:04.781 --> 25:08.516
We both know you're
the love of my life.

25:09.118 --> 25:12.720
I think you might feel
the same way.

25:13.321 --> 25:14.756
Come on, we're leaving.

25:14.823 --> 25:15.923
Ty, what are you doing here?

25:16.025 --> 25:17.058
Let's go.

25:17.126 --> 25:18.459
Come on, man,
we're just having a coffee.

25:18.527 --> 25:20.594
Why don't you sit down
and join us for a while?

25:20.663 --> 25:22.029
Ah, grow up.
Jeez.

25:27.301 --> 25:29.069
I'll take a double scotch,
please.

25:29.137 --> 25:30.303
You got it.

25:30.371 --> 25:31.337
Neat.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.873
No problem.

25:33.941 --> 25:35.142
You told me
you split from him.

25:35.209 --> 25:36.276
I did.

25:36.343 --> 25:37.410
Then what the hell
are you doing in there?

25:37.478 --> 25:38.477
I was talking to him-
listening mostly.

25:38.545 --> 25:40.179
Get in the truck!

25:46.820 --> 25:48.520
Evening, Clay.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.690
Got your message,
Jack.

25:50.757 --> 25:51.691
Surprised to hear
your granddaughter's done

25:51.758 --> 25:53.225
with the horse already,

25:53.293 --> 25:54.292
'cause from what
my son tells me,

25:54.359 --> 25:57.162
she never even got started.

25:57.229 --> 25:59.497
Yeah, well,
uh, that's...

26:00.532 --> 26:01.900
What I wanted to talk
to you about.

26:01.967 --> 26:03.668
I know she's family, Jack,
and uh,

26:03.736 --> 26:05.070
well, you get a right
to be proud of her and all,

26:05.137 --> 26:06.537
but uh...

26:06.605 --> 26:07.672
Well, I don't think
she has a clue

26:07.740 --> 26:08.707
when it comes
to roping horses.

26:08.774 --> 26:10.440
Now that's not true,

26:10.508 --> 26:12.275
and there's nothing wrong
with that horse.

26:12.343 --> 26:15.145
So how come Cody can't
rope good any more, hmm?

26:15.213 --> 26:17.380
Well, maybe he doesn't
want to rope.

26:17.448 --> 26:19.216
Maybe he never did.

26:19.283 --> 26:21.318
You got no right to say that.
You don't even know the boy!

26:21.385 --> 26:23.887
All I know is what
Amy tells me,

26:23.955 --> 26:24.922
and she does tell me

26:24.989 --> 26:28.858
that he plays the piano
really good.

26:28.926 --> 26:30.292
As for the roping...

26:31.661 --> 26:34.897
His heart's just not in it,
Clay.

26:46.008 --> 26:48.543
Well, thanks for the lift.

26:49.311 --> 26:50.678
Come on, Mom.

26:52.148 --> 26:54.549
I'm not the bad guy here.

26:54.617 --> 26:55.917
Do you remember
the cuts?

26:55.985 --> 26:56.918
The bruises?

26:58.486 --> 27:00.254
The last time,
I had to pull him off of you.

27:00.321 --> 27:01.288
I know.

27:03.491 --> 27:06.861
I've never forgiven
myself for that.

27:07.829 --> 27:10.530
I wish I could've done
things differently, Ty.

27:10.598 --> 27:12.432
But you didn't.

27:12.500 --> 27:16.535
And I just pulled you
out of a bar with him.

27:19.974 --> 27:21.241
Look...

27:21.308 --> 27:24.443
I'm glad that you're here
and everything,

27:24.511 --> 27:26.946
but you gotta
make a choice.

27:27.014 --> 27:28.114
Him or me.

27:29.283 --> 27:32.217
You wanna hang out
with Wade?

27:32.285 --> 27:34.787
Fine.

27:34.854 --> 27:39.424
But then you gotta leave me
outta your life.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.598
Good night, Mom.

28:11.522 --> 28:13.223
<i>Lily, hi.</i>

28:13.291 --> 28:14.257
We were worried about you.

28:14.325 --> 28:15.826
I'm sorry.

28:15.893 --> 28:17.827
I should've let you know
when I was going out.

28:17.894 --> 28:20.696
I'm fine.
Everything is fine.

28:20.763 --> 28:25.000
So if you don't mind,
I... I think I'll just...

28:25.068 --> 28:26.035
Lily?

28:29.840 --> 28:33.809
We are trying our best
to keep you out of harm's way.

28:33.876 --> 28:35.910
A little cooperation
on your part

28:35.978 --> 28:38.880
would be mightily
appreciated.

28:44.854 --> 28:45.820
<i>Hey.</i>

28:45.888 --> 28:47.121
<i>Hey.</i>

28:47.622 --> 28:50.357
Well, your face looks okay.
Let me see your hands.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.392
I didn't hit him.

28:52.460 --> 28:54.161
Okay, you're good.

28:54.229 --> 28:55.996
It took everything I had
not to.

28:56.064 --> 28:57.364
So how's your mom?

28:58.599 --> 28:59.666
Well,
she was acting all strong,

28:59.734 --> 29:01.134
like she has everything
under control,

29:01.202 --> 29:02.903
but I'm not buying it.

29:02.971 --> 29:05.239
Do you want me
to stay tonight?

29:05.306 --> 29:06.772
While I'm working
for your dad?

29:06.840 --> 29:08.140
I'll be all right.
Thank you.

29:08.208 --> 29:09.175
Okay.

29:12.445 --> 29:13.246
Good night.

29:14.748 --> 29:16.182
Hey, buddy.

29:48.446 --> 29:49.246
<i>Get!</i>

29:51.149 --> 29:52.116
<i>Loose horse!</i>

29:55.452 --> 29:56.852
Someone give me a hand!

29:56.921 --> 29:58.321
Whoa, whoa!
Easy boy! Easy!

30:42.229 --> 30:43.629
Thirsty, buddy?

30:46.633 --> 30:47.567
How's that?

31:02.682 --> 31:03.548
Wow!

31:04.684 --> 31:05.917
That was incredible.

31:05.986 --> 31:07.752
I didn't know a cowboy
could play classical music.

31:07.820 --> 31:09.054
Well, actually,
this thing plays pretty good

31:09.122 --> 31:10.655
now that you've got it
tuned up.

31:10.973 --> 31:14.808
I have to admit,
I'm kind of embarrassed.

31:14.876 --> 31:16.244
Well, Clay,
just because our kids

31:16.311 --> 31:18.746
don't follow exactly
in our footsteps...

31:18.813 --> 31:21.014
Nah, nah.
It ain't that.

31:21.082 --> 31:23.750
You know why my kid
never told me?

31:23.817 --> 31:25.952
'Cause he thought
I wouldn't approve.

31:27.455 --> 31:28.622
Hell, if I could play
like that,

31:28.689 --> 31:29.956
I wouldn't want
to swing a rope either.

31:35.296 --> 31:36.195
Thanks.

31:36.264 --> 31:37.264
Grab that, Mallory.

31:37.331 --> 31:39.498
Did I, uh,
did I tell you that piano

31:39.566 --> 31:41.367
is a family heirloom?

31:41.434 --> 31:42.901
My grandmother played it.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.136
<i>And believe me,</i>

31:44.203 --> 31:46.538
they do not make 'em
like that any more.

31:46.606 --> 31:48.073
So what you're saying is,
uh...

31:48.141 --> 31:49.207
It's old, it's used,

31:50.843 --> 31:52.177
and I can forget about
spare parts.

31:52.245 --> 31:54.379
Just give him the piano,
Grampa.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.847
It's not doing anything here
but taking up space.

32:03.789 --> 32:06.824
Hey, Ty,
how'd it go last night?

32:06.892 --> 32:08.225
No problems.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.794
Good.

32:10.495 --> 32:13.463
So, you ready to leave those
other guys in the dust, champ?

32:15.099 --> 32:15.932
All right.

32:19.337 --> 32:21.271
Lucky number four.

32:24.542 --> 32:25.809
<i>The current odds
have number four -</i>

32:25.876 --> 32:27.109
<i>"Lightning Dexter" -
as your favourite</i>

32:27.177 --> 32:28.243
<i>at three to one.</i>

32:28.312 --> 32:29.545
<i>Number two - "Alberta Comet"</i>

32:29.613 --> 32:31.079
<i>is the long shot
at twelve to one odds.</i>

32:31.147 --> 32:34.350
<i>Number one - "In High Places"
is at seven to one...</i>

32:34.418 --> 32:36.185
Hello, folks.

32:36.252 --> 32:38.987
Well, it's a beautiful day
for a horse race.

32:39.055 --> 32:40.255
We'll see how
beautiful it is

32:40.324 --> 32:41.857
when they cross
he finish line.

32:41.925 --> 32:43.191
Yes, we will.

32:43.793 --> 32:46.494
Bet on number two
"Alberta Comet."

32:46.562 --> 32:48.196
Jack, I have a tip for you.

32:48.263 --> 32:50.498
<i>"Lightning Dexter,"
number four.</i>

32:50.566 --> 32:52.634
<i>The bookies even have him
pegged as a winner.</i>

32:52.702 --> 32:54.636
I've gambled enough
of my hard earned money

32:54.704 --> 32:57.572
on you already, Tim.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.306
<i>They're at the post
for the 15th Annual</i>

32:59.374 --> 33:00.708
<i>running of the Hudson Stakes.</i>

33:00.775 --> 33:04.211
<i>A mile and a quarter
for a $15,000 purse!</i>

33:05.213 --> 33:06.980
<i>And they're off!</i>

33:07.048 --> 33:08.482
<i>"Right Bower" is first
out of the gate</i>

33:08.550 --> 33:10.451
<i>followed by "Valour's Jack."</i>

33:10.518 --> 33:12.820
<i>"Lightning Dexter"
is fighting for third.</i>

33:13.822 --> 33:15.722
Let's go!

33:15.789 --> 33:17.056
<i>"Alberta Comet" moves ahead
of "Lightning Dexter"...</i>

33:19.292 --> 33:20.660
<i>"High Places" leads
with "Alberta Comet"</i>

33:20.728 --> 33:21.828
<i>really coming on!</i>

33:21.895 --> 33:24.230
<i>Boy! It's a horse race today!</i>

33:24.297 --> 33:25.665
<i>This is turning into the race
of the year!</i>

33:31.103 --> 33:33.104
<i>"Alberta Comet"
is really moving!</i>

33:33.172 --> 33:34.005
<i>The favourite,
"Lightning Dexter,"</i>

33:34.073 --> 33:35.674
<i>is running dead last,</i>

33:35.742 --> 33:37.476
<i>but "Alberta Comet"
is holding strong</i>

33:37.543 --> 33:38.309
<i>in first place!</i>

33:38.378 --> 33:39.711
Go, Comet! Let's go!

33:39.779 --> 33:41.847
<i>Look at "Alberta Comet" go!</i>

33:41.914 --> 33:43.482
<i>So this means
"Lightning Dexter"</i>

33:43.549 --> 33:45.751
<i>will have to make his move
from his way in fifth spot!</i>

33:45.818 --> 33:47.184
Come on, Lightning!

33:47.252 --> 33:48.419
<i>"Alberta Comet" is coming on</i>

33:48.487 --> 33:49.787
<i>as they move into
the final turn!</i>

33:49.855 --> 33:51.054
<i>And it's "Alberta Comet"</i>

33:51.122 --> 33:52.523
<i>taking a commanding lead
on the outside!</i>

33:52.591 --> 33:54.024
Come on, let's go!

33:54.092 --> 33:55.559
<i>"Alberta Comet"
is pulling away,</i>

33:55.627 --> 33:57.294
<i>while Lightning Dexter
is making no move</i>

33:57.362 --> 33:58.996
<i>bringing up the rear!</i>

33:59.063 --> 34:02.199
<i>It's "Alberta Comet."
"Alberta Comet" wins!</i>

34:02.267 --> 34:04.734
<i>"In High Places" in second,
"Valour's Jack" is in third,</i>

34:04.802 --> 34:06.202
<i>and "Lightning Dexter"</i>

34:06.270 --> 34:08.471
<i>comes in a disappointing
last place!</i>

34:08.539 --> 34:11.172
Maybe next time, Tim, hmm?

34:11.241 --> 34:13.543
<i>Dad, you know,
he did great at the start.</i>

34:13.610 --> 34:15.478
Maybe he's just
having an off day.

34:15.545 --> 34:18.813
<i>So the winner of your
15th Annual Hudson Stakes</i>

34:18.882 --> 34:20.681
<i>is "Alberta Comet"!</i>

34:25.467 --> 34:26.534
Well, good news.

34:26.603 --> 34:27.569
There's nothing wrong
with your horse.

34:27.638 --> 34:29.639
He's just a bit waterlogged.

34:29.706 --> 34:30.940
Waterlogged?

34:31.007 --> 34:32.540
Yeah, his belly's
full of water.

34:35.511 --> 34:36.844
Well, his water bucket's
completely empty.

34:36.911 --> 34:40.815
He must have drank it all
before the race.

34:45.320 --> 34:46.286
Salt.

34:46.355 --> 34:49.123
Somebody put salt
in his hay.

34:52.460 --> 34:53.326
Thank you very much.

34:53.393 --> 34:54.261
<i>Have a good day.</i>

34:54.328 --> 34:55.696
Okay, you too.

34:56.898 --> 34:57.865
Lily, hey!

34:59.000 --> 35:00.433
Phew!

35:00.501 --> 35:02.770
What happened
to "I've changed?"

35:02.837 --> 35:03.870
What happened
to "I quit gambling?"

35:03.937 --> 35:06.039
Aw, no,
it's not like that.

35:06.106 --> 35:08.174
No, this, this uh...

35:08.241 --> 35:09.142
This was a sure thing.

35:09.209 --> 35:11.177
100 percent.
No risk involved.

35:11.244 --> 35:12.745
I've heard that before.

35:12.813 --> 35:14.981
Yeah, but Lily,
this time it's different.

35:15.049 --> 35:17.216
I mean,
I've got a clear vision.

35:17.284 --> 35:18.951
I've got a clear mind.

35:19.019 --> 35:20.451
I know where I'm going.

35:20.519 --> 35:23.989
There's only one thing
holding me back.

35:24.057 --> 35:26.558
If I had you by my side
there'd be nothing to stop us.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.426
What do you say, Lily?

35:28.494 --> 35:29.427
I... I can't.

35:30.496 --> 35:32.130
I promised Ty.

35:33.166 --> 35:35.567
But you promised me too,
remember?

35:35.634 --> 35:38.602
Huh?
"Till death to us part."

35:38.670 --> 35:40.504
Come on, Lily.

35:40.572 --> 35:42.339
I can work things out
with Ty.

35:42.407 --> 35:44.075
You know...

35:44.142 --> 35:45.176
I know I can.

35:46.244 --> 35:48.045
Just give me a shot
to do that.

35:48.113 --> 35:51.881
This, this could be our fresh
start right here.

35:51.949 --> 35:53.750
Wade...

35:53.818 --> 35:56.820
Wade, you know that
never worked with us.

35:56.887 --> 35:59.388
Yeah, but this time
it could.

35:59.456 --> 36:01.157
It could.
It could.

36:01.225 --> 36:03.860
I love you.
Let's go home.

36:07.698 --> 36:08.597
Ty!

36:10.166 --> 36:11.299
You stayed with my horse
last night -

36:11.367 --> 36:12.667
the whole night?

36:12.736 --> 36:14.469
Yeah.
Except, uh,

36:14.537 --> 36:18.506
I had to go see my mom
so Amy covered for me.

36:18.574 --> 36:20.508
So who am I talking to?
You or my daughter?

36:20.576 --> 36:21.877
Dad,
what is the big deal?

36:21.945 --> 36:23.245
The big deal?

36:23.312 --> 36:25.347
The big deal is that somebody
salted Lightning's hay

36:25.414 --> 36:27.749
to throw the race.

36:27.816 --> 36:28.550
I don't get it.
What...?

36:28.618 --> 36:30.118
They put salt in the hay.

36:30.185 --> 36:31.653
It makes them drink
too much water.

36:31.721 --> 36:33.622
And he was so full of water

36:33.689 --> 36:34.689
that he came waddling
out of the gate

36:34.757 --> 36:36.057
like a beached whale!

36:36.125 --> 36:37.425
So you're telling me
that one of you

36:37.493 --> 36:38.693
stayed with him
last night?

36:38.761 --> 36:41.161
Uh, well, actually, um...

36:41.229 --> 36:42.596
One of the horses got out
in the middle of the night

36:42.664 --> 36:43.997
and I had to help
round him up-

36:44.065 --> 36:46.233
You picked a great night
to be a good samaritan.

36:46.301 --> 36:47.668
I was only gone
for a couple of seconds.

36:47.736 --> 36:49.169
I... he...
I didn't think it was-

36:49.237 --> 36:50.704
You didn't think, Ty!

36:50.772 --> 36:52.706
You didn't think.

36:54.309 --> 36:55.709
It wasn't Ty's fault,

36:55.777 --> 36:57.710
but Dad's talking like
it was him who salted the hay.

36:57.778 --> 37:00.179
Well, Dad had a lot
riding on that horse.

37:00.281 --> 37:01.681
Yeah, but come on, Lou.

37:01.749 --> 37:03.349
A loose horse in the middle
of the night?

37:03.417 --> 37:05.285
It had to be a setup.

37:05.352 --> 37:07.219
You think someone's
trying to frame Ty?

37:07.288 --> 37:08.354
Well, I don't know.

37:08.422 --> 37:09.555
What I don't get
is why anyone

37:09.623 --> 37:11.957
would wanna make sure
Dad's horse lost.

37:12.275 --> 37:13.542
Well,
Lightning was the favourite,

37:13.609 --> 37:14.776
so if you wanna make
a lot of money

37:14.844 --> 37:17.245
you bet on the long shot.

37:17.312 --> 37:19.347
Like "Comet",
Lisa's horse.

37:19.415 --> 37:20.682
You wanna be the one
to tell Grampa

37:20.750 --> 37:22.717
that his girlfriend
rigged the race?

37:22.785 --> 37:23.852
<i>Lou, this isn't funny.</i>

37:23.920 --> 37:25.720
Ty could lose his job
at the track.

37:25.788 --> 37:27.589
And anyone could
have rigged that!

37:27.657 --> 37:30.524
Yeah, anyone looking
to make a big payday.

37:30.592 --> 37:32.059
A sure thing.

37:32.126 --> 37:33.527
No risk involved.

37:37.998 --> 37:41.000
Come on, Lily,
answer your phone.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.110
I know who did it
at the track,

37:52.178 --> 37:53.511
with the salt.

37:55.882 --> 37:56.815
Wade.

37:56.883 --> 37:58.149
Ty...

37:58.217 --> 37:59.350
Ty, please,
you gotta believe me.

37:59.418 --> 38:00.752
I just went to see
him yesterday

38:00.820 --> 38:04.255
so I could clear things up
once and for all.

38:04.323 --> 38:05.958
But there he was
at the track,

38:06.025 --> 38:07.059
and he...

38:08.293 --> 38:10.294
He starts talking.

38:10.361 --> 38:13.030
He makes everything sound
so reasonable,

38:13.098 --> 38:15.265
like we can just put
the bad stuff behind us

38:15.333 --> 38:17.034
and have a real future-

38:17.102 --> 38:19.737
So what're you doing here,
Mom?

38:20.739 --> 38:22.306
Go.

38:22.373 --> 38:24.507
Go be with him
if you want to.

38:24.575 --> 38:25.575
No.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.413
I made a mistake.

38:31.582 --> 38:34.484
Look, we both know
I'm not perfect.

38:34.551 --> 38:35.652
Bringing you into the world

38:35.720 --> 38:38.054
was the best thing
that I ever did.

38:38.122 --> 38:39.788
So if I have to choose
between you

38:39.856 --> 38:40.756
and anything else,

38:40.824 --> 38:42.424
I choose you.

39:25.299 --> 39:26.666
Wade.

39:26.734 --> 39:27.600
Get in the house, Mom.

39:27.668 --> 39:28.800
Ty, you don't have
to do this.

39:28.869 --> 39:31.403
Get in the house now,
Mom!

39:34.975 --> 39:38.577
You know, Ty,
I've been thinking.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.145
If it wasn't for you,
my wife there,

39:40.213 --> 39:43.082
she'd be at home with me
where she belongs.

39:43.149 --> 39:44.515
Now maybe you haven't
figured it out yet,

39:44.583 --> 39:47.952
but she's gonna choose me
every time!

39:49.621 --> 39:52.023
So why don't you just
give it up, buddy?

39:52.091 --> 39:54.058
Just do yourself a favour,
Wade, and leave.

39:54.126 --> 39:55.159
Right now.

39:55.227 --> 39:56.928
Why is that?

39:56.996 --> 39:59.163
You gonna hit me, Ty?

39:59.231 --> 40:01.198
You gonna hit me
like you did last time?

40:01.266 --> 40:03.466
What're you gonna do,
Ty?

40:03.534 --> 40:05.035
I got news for you, man.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.237
This time I'm sober,

40:07.305 --> 40:10.073
and my back's not
turned to you.

40:10.975 --> 40:12.609
What the hell,
let's make it even Steven.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.512
Come on,
give me your best shot.

40:16.613 --> 40:18.214
Come on, tough guy.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.848
Come on, you got it in you,
don't you?

40:19.917 --> 40:21.150
Come on, let's go.

40:21.218 --> 40:22.151
You got it in you.
Let's go.

40:22.219 --> 40:23.519
Come on, come on.

40:23.586 --> 40:25.288
Yeah. Now, okay.

40:26.790 --> 40:28.590
Ready? Let's go.

40:29.492 --> 40:30.326
Ty, no!

40:32.228 --> 40:33.194
<i>Ty!</i>

40:34.496 --> 40:35.797
<i>Come on, man, do it!</i>

40:35.864 --> 40:37.665
Show these people
your true colours, man.

40:37.733 --> 40:39.267
Hit me!

40:39.335 --> 40:40.268
<i>Do it.</i>

40:44.307 --> 40:45.506
You know what, Wade?

40:45.574 --> 40:47.575
You're not worth it.

40:47.643 --> 40:48.542
You never were.

40:48.609 --> 40:50.510
That's some tough talk.

40:51.546 --> 40:53.513
To bad that's all it is.

40:58.853 --> 41:01.221
You're trespassing
on my property.

41:01.289 --> 41:02.356
Best be moving on.

41:02.424 --> 41:03.690
Yeah, I get it.

41:05.659 --> 41:08.194
You coming, Lily?
Let's go.

41:08.262 --> 41:09.228
<i>Come on, Lily,</i>

41:09.296 --> 41:11.197
this has nothing
to do with you.

41:11.265 --> 41:13.266
Let's go. I forgive you.
I'm not mad at you any more.

41:13.334 --> 41:14.633
<i>Let's go.</i>

41:14.701 --> 41:16.970
You're not mad at me?

41:17.537 --> 41:19.805
You're not mad at me?

41:22.976 --> 41:24.876
Stay with your son then.

41:24.944 --> 41:27.279
Have a good life.

41:27.347 --> 41:28.347
<i>Hey!</i>

41:29.382 --> 41:30.715
Don't forget this.

41:33.719 --> 41:35.854
In case you have a flat
on your way out of here.

41:48.975 --> 41:50.976
<i>Well, not what I expected
to be bringing home,</i>

41:51.094 --> 41:52.728
but I tell you what,

41:53.046 --> 41:54.479
it feels just about
as heavy as a horse.

41:56.115 --> 41:57.816
I really appreciate this, Jack.

41:57.883 --> 41:59.923
I'm glad your son's
gonna get some use

41:59.951 --> 42:01.152
out of this old piano.

42:01.220 --> 42:02.153
Yeah.

42:04.323 --> 42:06.157
I don't know how
to thank you though.

42:06.225 --> 42:08.126
How about a free copy
of your first CD?

42:08.194 --> 42:09.493
All right.

42:11.062 --> 42:12.495
I'll see ya.

42:18.536 --> 42:19.703
You know, Ty,
I'm so sorry

42:19.771 --> 42:22.806
my coming here
caused so many problems.

42:22.874 --> 42:25.308
I'm still glad
you came.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.377
I want you
to have this.

42:28.445 --> 42:29.678
What is it?

42:30.881 --> 42:32.815
It's the money
you gave me.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.316
Yeah,
I gave it to you.

42:34.384 --> 42:37.486
I know,
and it was so sweet of you.

42:38.488 --> 42:40.890
But you told me
you wanna go to university,

42:40.958 --> 42:43.091
and you're gonna need this.

42:47.930 --> 42:49.464
Are you okay, Mom?

42:49.531 --> 42:50.531
Yeah.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.301
I'm just so proud
of you.

43:00.909 --> 43:02.943
Have a safe trip, Mom.

43:03.011 --> 43:07.815
♪ Try to bridge the space
between us ♪

43:08.683 --> 43:12.586
♪ the longest road
I walk along ♪

43:13.488 --> 43:17.390
♪ the hardest part
is letting go... ♪

43:19.226 --> 43:20.994
What's going on,
Lou?

43:21.061 --> 43:22.662
This is my half

43:23.730 --> 43:25.598
and that is your half,

43:25.666 --> 43:27.066
but now it's organized.

43:27.134 --> 43:29.368
So, you put
everything back?

43:30.470 --> 43:32.004
I guess I'd rather
share this space

43:32.071 --> 43:33.839
with six generations
of junk,

43:33.907 --> 43:36.608
than be the kind of person
who can fit their whole life

43:36.676 --> 43:39.311
into a couple
of suitcases.

43:42.148 --> 43:43.148
So what?

43:43.216 --> 43:46.318
You're saying
we're roommates?

43:46.452 --> 43:47.451
Sure.

43:48.787 --> 43:50.754
But if any of your stuff
crosses this line

43:50.823 --> 43:52.456
I'm throwing it out.

43:59.964 --> 44:00.997
Ty?

44:03.067 --> 44:04.368
Hey.

44:04.436 --> 44:05.436
Hey.

44:08.873 --> 44:10.540
Turns out my mom did have
a baby picture of me

44:10.607 --> 44:12.542
after all.

44:15.846 --> 44:18.280
Look at those
chubby cheeks.

44:19.550 --> 44:22.785
I was pretty adorable,
wasn't I?

44:22.853 --> 44:23.886
Yeah.

44:24.921 --> 44:26.888
You still are.
