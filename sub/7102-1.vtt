03:28.208 --> 03:30.875
Why do you have to go back to France?

03:31.667 --> 03:33.958
Because I have a lot to do.

03:34.042 --> 03:35.958
It makes me sad to...

03:37.500 --> 03:41.875
look at the sea, the sand and you...

03:42.917 --> 03:45.125
and know that I have to go.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.500
You understand?

03:46.583 --> 03:49.083
I have so many feelings for you.

03:52.042 --> 03:53.167
Tell me.

03:55.458 --> 03:56.708
So...

03:57.583 --> 04:01.000
Won't you give me something
before you leave?

04:01.708 --> 04:03.375
Some money perhaps?

04:04.458 --> 04:05.500
I will.

04:05.583 --> 04:09.208
I also wanted to give you a present.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.417
Something you can always carry with you

04:12.500 --> 04:14.333
after I leave.

04:17.041 --> 04:19.416
Give me the chain.

04:21.416 --> 04:23.333
-This one?
-Yeah, that one.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.250
Okay, take it.

04:52.958 --> 04:55.250
I just know that one has 32...

08:45.667 --> 08:47.500
What you up to, Yanmarco?

08:47.583 --> 08:48.833
Just chilling.

08:48.917 --> 08:50.417
Where is she?

10:32.750 --> 10:35.750
Two steps this way,
two steps the other way.

10:35.833 --> 10:38.833
Two steps here,
two steps there.

10:39.917 --> 10:41.417
Look at my feet.

10:45.292 --> 10:47.042
They touch, see?

11:27.125 --> 11:30.958
Come on, we have to go to the town.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.708
You know we have to, honey.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.500
Even though I want to stay here with you.

11:48.917 --> 11:49.958
Come on.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.625
I like your body, did you know that?

12:08.542 --> 12:10.083
How much is it?

12:11.958 --> 12:14.250
1,625.

12:15.583 --> 12:17.250
I'll buy it from you.

12:19.958 --> 12:22.042
I like you too much.

12:25.167 --> 12:26.583
Did you know that?

12:28.208 --> 12:30.208
Let's head into town.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.042
Okay, honey.

12:34.292 --> 12:35.500
Okay.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.458
Is that my phone?

13:20.792 --> 13:22.625
Did my phone ring?

13:22.708 --> 13:23.875
Yes.

13:30.708 --> 13:32.000
Who is it?

13:33.083 --> 13:34.667
My brother.

13:34.792 --> 13:36.708
He met with an accident.

13:39.125 --> 13:41.292
Can you lend me some more money?

13:48.583 --> 13:50.708
What's that little box?

13:54.708 --> 13:56.083
Is it for me?

13:57.292 --> 13:59.583
It's a cell phone, for me!

14:07.167 --> 14:08.875
So cool, thanks!

14:13.042 --> 14:15.042
Let's take your picture.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.833
One second.

14:21.875 --> 14:23.250
Your brother...

14:26.375 --> 14:28.042
He met with an accident?

14:28.125 --> 14:29.208
Yes, on his motorcycle.

14:29.292 --> 14:30.958
Let's take your picture.

14:32.208 --> 14:33.542
Smile.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.458
And...

14:40.625 --> 14:43.333
You need more money,
for your brother?

14:43.417 --> 14:44.917
Yes, I need more money.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.167
Smile.

14:56.208 --> 14:59.250
Look, I set your photo as my wallpaper.

15:02.625 --> 15:04.042
Do you like it?

15:37.833 --> 15:39.792
-Is it correct?
-Yes.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.125
Are you coming with me?

15:44.208 --> 15:46.542
No, I have to go home.

15:47.333 --> 15:48.958
Can you take a cab?

15:49.042 --> 15:50.042
Yes.

16:04.167 --> 16:05.833
This one's brand-new.

16:05.917 --> 16:07.208
Of course.

16:08.417 --> 16:09.833
And the old one?

16:10.625 --> 16:12.208
It's at the house.

16:12.292 --> 16:13.458
Lend me this one.

16:13.542 --> 16:14.583
No.

16:14.667 --> 16:16.417
It'll just be for a couple of days.

16:17.333 --> 16:18.333
No.

16:18.417 --> 16:19.667
All right.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.167
It's cool.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.125
Let me take a picture of you.

16:30.292 --> 16:31.667
Let me see it.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.000
Let's take one of us together.

16:38.542 --> 16:39.792
There we go.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.333
Set it as your wallpaper.

16:46.417 --> 16:50.583
Are you crazy?
I already have the old lady there.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.875
It's no big deal,
just a picture with your brother.

16:54.792 --> 16:56.583
Weren't you going to play today?

16:57.500 --> 17:01.917
I'm not going
because the party isn't worth it.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.375
It's too far.

17:04.833 --> 17:07.125
-Yeah.
-They're hardly paying anything.

17:09.958 --> 17:11.416
What?

17:11.500 --> 17:12.708
Nothing.

17:12.791 --> 17:13.875
It wasn't worth it.

17:13.958 --> 17:16.000
I didn't say anything.
I'm just laughing.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.166
I won't play for nothing.

17:23.958 --> 17:25.333
Hello?

17:26.541 --> 17:29.542
Hi, my little boy, how are you?

17:32.500 --> 17:33.750
It's Granny.

17:34.583 --> 17:36.083
What did you do?

17:38.083 --> 17:40.375
A big yucky poo, you little piggy.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.333
Is your father around?

17:43.375 --> 17:44.458
Put him on.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.417
Hi, honey.

17:54.708 --> 17:55.958
How are you?

17:58.792 --> 17:59.875
Hello.

18:01.333 --> 18:02.375
Hello?

18:03.917 --> 18:05.333
Can you hear me?

18:09.083 --> 18:10.208
Hello?

18:12.917 --> 18:15.000
Yes, I get it.

18:16.583 --> 18:18.667
It's a bad line again.

18:22.542 --> 18:23.667
Hello?

18:27.333 --> 18:29.083
Take care of yourself.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.167
Did the old lady say
she's taking you with her?

19:27.792 --> 19:29.750
Yes, I think she means it this time.

19:29.833 --> 19:31.375
This time it's for real?

19:31.458 --> 19:33.333
She asked for my ID.

19:35.667 --> 19:38.208
You think you won't be
with another girl?

19:39.583 --> 19:41.208
Of course not, baby.

19:44.167 --> 19:45.958
You know I'm yours.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.250
You can't forget that.

19:53.750 --> 19:56.792
You're the one who might go crazy there...

19:59.833 --> 20:02.958
with all those lights.
You might not want to come back.

20:07.542 --> 20:10.667
So you won't sleep
with some French guy there?

20:10.750 --> 20:12.833
I'm only gonna be with the old lady.

20:12.917 --> 20:14.833
You know I have to.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.417
You gotta send me my share.

20:20.167 --> 20:22.208
Are you really gonna let me go?

20:23.917 --> 20:26.958
Why do you ask?
Don't you want to go?

20:27.042 --> 20:28.542
Just asking.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.750
I wanna know what you think.

21:26.667 --> 21:27.875
Come here, babe.

22:28.458 --> 22:30.667
Let's wait till the winter is over.

22:32.292 --> 22:34.458
But since it's winter now,

22:34.542 --> 22:36.792
let's start the process

22:36.917 --> 22:38.875
and get done with all the paperwork.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.583
Yamelki told me...

22:41.500 --> 22:45.958
it's easier to get the visa

22:46.042 --> 22:48.250
if you already have the plane ticket.

22:49.042 --> 22:51.667
-Yamelki knows a lot.
-What?

22:51.750 --> 22:54.667
Yamelki knows a lot.
Let me put this on you.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.125
Gorgeous.

23:03.375 --> 23:05.292
Let's look for other treasures.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.042
So beautiful.

23:24.542 --> 23:27.250
Is it cold there in France?

23:27.333 --> 23:28.250
What?

23:28.333 --> 23:30.250
Is it cold in France?

23:34.167 --> 23:36.792
Haven't you asked your mom how it is?

23:38.292 --> 23:41.625
No, I haven't spoken with her
in a long time.

23:41.708 --> 23:43.333
I lost her number.

23:45.625 --> 23:46.583
Where is she?

23:47.208 --> 23:48.083
In Spain.

23:48.167 --> 23:50.917
I know, but in which city?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.375
Barcelona.

24:57.292 --> 24:59.667
How does she treat you?
You never tell me.

24:59.750 --> 25:01.458
What do you do?

25:02.583 --> 25:04.000
She treats me well.

25:08.667 --> 25:10.292
What does she do to you?

25:20.583 --> 25:22.125
I'm asking 'cause...

25:23.042 --> 25:26.583
sometimes I think about it.

25:28.458 --> 25:31.125
About what you do together,

25:31.208 --> 25:33.083
about whether she treats you well.

25:50.292 --> 25:51.583
It's all right.

26:26.750 --> 26:27.833
Good morning.

26:29.083 --> 26:30.500
Do you smoke?

26:32.125 --> 26:33.083
Yes.

26:33.750 --> 26:35.125
How much?

26:36.542 --> 26:38.333
One pack

26:38.417 --> 26:40.458
in the afternoon.

26:42.167 --> 26:43.875
Do you drink?

26:45.667 --> 26:46.917
Yes.

26:47.750 --> 26:50.875
A little or a lot?
Do you drink when you go out?

26:50.958 --> 26:52.625
A little, when I go out.

26:54.083 --> 26:56.542
Do you take any other substances?

26:57.833 --> 26:58.875
No.

27:02.125 --> 27:04.583
The date of your last period?

27:05.583 --> 27:07.542
28th September.

27:11.458 --> 27:13.667
28th September?

27:13.750 --> 27:14.833
Yes.

27:15.875 --> 27:17.167
Any abortions?

27:17.917 --> 27:18.792
Yes.

27:18.875 --> 27:19.917
How many?

27:20.000 --> 27:21.042
One.

27:21.667 --> 27:25.000
Okay. Let's see...

27:25.083 --> 27:30.250
If your last period
was on 28th September...

27:31.792 --> 27:34.458
-Are you sure about the date?
-Yes.

27:35.333 --> 27:39.000
Your possible due date is...

27:42.833 --> 27:45.375
the fourth of July.

29:32.417 --> 29:35.417
I saw you talking to some girl last night.

29:35.542 --> 29:37.458
That didn't mean anything, babe.

29:38.417 --> 29:42.625
We just met. She might even get me a job.

29:46.417 --> 29:48.917
Besides, you spend all day
with that old lady,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.083
and I never say anything.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.417
See you later then.

30:15.875 --> 30:17.917
Are you having just water?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.458
Yes, just water.

30:29.958 --> 30:33.708
The guy that was sitting here,
who said hello,

30:33.792 --> 30:35.542
do you know him?

30:35.625 --> 30:36.708
Yes.

30:37.417 --> 30:38.625
How?

30:40.042 --> 30:42.875
He's been here for a while,
he's from Italy.

30:46.208 --> 30:48.167
And how did you meet him?

30:49.250 --> 30:50.750
I met him right here.

30:51.375 --> 30:53.542
Right here, in this bar?

30:53.625 --> 30:56.792
No, here in Las Terrenas.

31:00.375 --> 31:01.542
While dancing?

31:01.625 --> 31:02.708
Yes.

31:14.250 --> 31:15.708
Is something wrong?

31:18.625 --> 31:19.625
No.

31:23.083 --> 31:25.000
Didn't you want to come to the beach?

31:25.083 --> 31:26.375
Here we are.

31:32.833 --> 31:34.042
Are you hungry?

31:34.125 --> 31:35.125
No.

31:35.875 --> 31:38.542
What happened, then?
Something is bothering you.

31:39.750 --> 31:41.333
I need some money.

31:42.958 --> 31:44.000
Money?

31:46.667 --> 31:48.958
What do you need the money for?

31:49.042 --> 31:50.333
For things.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.417
What things?

34:54.083 --> 34:56.625
To Casa Gloria, please.

34:58.708 --> 35:00.542
Are you going mad?

35:01.625 --> 35:03.792
No, I'm going to the hotel.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.208
You're coming with me.

35:14.250 --> 35:15.750
Aren't you listening?

35:19.208 --> 35:21.167
There's a bill to pay at the bar...

36:27.542 --> 36:31.167
Thanks. Hey, buddy.
Look, shoes for your wife.

38:21.958 --> 38:23.083
Hey!

38:26.083 --> 38:27.083
Hey!

38:29.750 --> 38:31.125
Where's Noelí?

38:31.667 --> 38:32.875
I don't know.

38:33.667 --> 38:35.333
Isn't she at your place?

38:35.417 --> 38:36.625
No.

38:36.750 --> 38:38.250
Is something wrong?

38:39.167 --> 38:44.917
Nothing is wrong, but she hasn't come
by the hotel for a while.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.208
I've been calling her nonstop,
and she isn't answering.

38:47.292 --> 38:48.958
Her phone broke.

38:50.500 --> 38:54.333
Relax, she must be around.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.458
She hasn't been to your place?

38:57.542 --> 39:00.500
No. When I see her,
I'll tell her to visit you.

39:02.958 --> 39:04.458
-Okay.
-Okay?

39:05.417 --> 39:06.667
All right.

41:48.708 --> 41:50.417
Yanmarco.

41:55.208 --> 41:56.458
Help me.

41:57.417 --> 41:59.042
Stand up, ma'am.

42:08.583 --> 42:10.333
How are you doing?

42:13.375 --> 42:15.042
Don't you see I'm all right?

42:16.167 --> 42:17.417
I do.

42:19.333 --> 42:20.708
Where's the old lady?

42:21.667 --> 42:23.292
Over at the house, probably.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.333
When are you going there?

42:26.417 --> 42:27.708
I'm not.

42:29.042 --> 42:30.292
What do you mean?

42:33.083 --> 42:34.667
What are we going to do?

42:37.083 --> 42:38.500
I don't know.

42:40.750 --> 42:42.125
You have to go there.

42:42.667 --> 42:44.583
I'm not going.

42:44.667 --> 42:47.208
Then what are we going to do, Noelí?

42:47.333 --> 42:49.083
What's your plan?

42:49.167 --> 42:50.708
Get yourself a job.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.250
Without a motorcycle, even?

42:56.333 --> 42:58.917
Go ahead and get one, you're the man.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.625
Oh, God.

43:21.125 --> 43:22.667
Where are you going?

43:23.292 --> 43:24.750
Why are you taking everything?

43:24.833 --> 43:26.958
Let me go. My whole body is aching.

43:27.042 --> 43:28.250
Please.

45:02.583 --> 45:03.958
I'll leave.

45:06.083 --> 45:07.333
I'll leave.

45:08.958 --> 45:10.208
for a breath of fresh air.

46:46.167 --> 46:49.500
In the Caribbean,
sugar is no longer produced.

46:49.583 --> 46:52.500
Nor in Cuba or Jamaica.

46:52.583 --> 46:53.667
But it is produced here

46:53.750 --> 46:56.750
because there's this factor
which is absent in those countries.

46:57.958 --> 46:59.792
So, you get the impression

46:59.875 --> 47:04.500
that this decision,
which excludes the Haitians,

47:04.583 --> 47:07.667
is basically...

47:40.458 --> 47:41.583
As we say.

47:47.167 --> 47:49.125
I really don't feel like leaving.

47:51.792 --> 47:53.333
Yes, but...

48:09.417 --> 48:12.125
So it was a truly wonderful experience.

48:12.208 --> 48:15.958
To get to know the woods
just as they were before.

48:16.042 --> 48:18.000
Without tourists.

48:18.083 --> 48:19.833
Now there are hotels everywhere.

48:19.917 --> 48:24.042
It has developed wonderfully,
by the way, fantastically.

48:24.167 --> 48:28.500
But a lot of things that are happening
are not very nice.

48:31.417 --> 48:32.875
-Is that you?
-Telephone.

48:32.958 --> 48:35.250
It's me. My wife.

52:29.375 --> 52:30.708
Yanmarco!

52:33.083 --> 52:36.625
Yanmarco, why is my room such a mess?

52:45.792 --> 52:47.375
What are you doing here?

52:56.500 --> 52:58.250
What happened to your hand?

52:58.333 --> 53:01.583
I met with a motorcycle accident,
I got mugged.

53:02.542 --> 53:05.292
-That's why you didn't come?
-Yes.

53:09.417 --> 53:10.750
Go away.

53:11.500 --> 53:13.458
I don't want to see you now.

53:19.250 --> 53:20.792
I'm pregnant.

53:37.333 --> 53:39.250
I don't want to see you.

55:13.375 --> 55:15.875
I missed you a lot, you know?

55:18.375 --> 55:20.458
I thought I was going to die.

55:22.500 --> 55:23.750
Me too.

55:49.417 --> 55:51.833
This baby is very strong.

55:51.917 --> 55:53.875
He hasn't been hurt.

55:53.958 --> 55:55.333
He's fine.

56:07.125 --> 56:08.417
Can we...

56:10.542 --> 56:14.583
have pictures of this, for memory?

56:14.667 --> 56:16.625
We'll get it printed now.

56:16.708 --> 56:18.500
-Oh, we can?
-Yes.

56:22.375 --> 56:23.958
The first picture.

56:50.208 --> 56:51.542
Stay still.

57:13.083 --> 57:15.000
How old is your son?

57:16.125 --> 57:17.583
He's 40.

57:18.917 --> 57:20.458
Does he have children?

57:20.542 --> 57:22.125
Yes, two kids.

57:24.333 --> 57:25.833
Boys or girls?

57:25.917 --> 57:27.917
An eight-year-old girl,

57:28.625 --> 57:30.208
and a six-year-old boy.

57:31.583 --> 57:33.417
And what about his wife?

57:36.167 --> 57:38.250
His wife died...

57:40.458 --> 57:42.208
in a car accident.

57:44.042 --> 57:45.500
He's a widower.

57:52.125 --> 57:55.750
And why hasn't he visited you?

57:59.125 --> 58:01.000
He doesn't want to see me.

58:01.083 --> 58:02.292
Why?

58:09.042 --> 58:12.542
Noelí, that's a very long story.

58:12.625 --> 58:14.667
I'll tell you about it someday.

58:16.917 --> 58:19.333
Come here, I'm talking to you!

58:37.458 --> 58:39.458
Anne, come back!

58:41.417 --> 58:42.542
Come back!

58:44.042 --> 58:45.125
Anne!

58:45.667 --> 58:46.917
Come back!

59:06.083 --> 59:08.833
Are you crazy?
Why did you go so far out?

01:00:00.417 --> 01:00:01.917
You like it!

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.458
Yes.

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:21.625
What is this?

01:00:35.167 --> 01:00:36.792
Is this mine?

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.667
Yes.

01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:46.250
Are you happy?

01:00:57.792 --> 01:00:59.042
This is it.

01:01:01.375 --> 01:01:02.625
This is it.

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:19.542
Is everything okay?

01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:27.792
Anyway, my son
is not going to talk to me.

01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:11.917
We gotta talk about a couple of things.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.458
People are saying that you're pregnant.

01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:22.708
Is that true?

01:04:28.208 --> 01:04:31.083
Why do I have to find out on the street?

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:34.042
They all beat me to it.
I was gonna tell you.

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:36.292
The old lady knows?

01:04:36.875 --> 01:04:38.083
Yes, she knows.

01:04:38.167 --> 01:04:41.708
She told me we were
going to have the baby there.

01:04:43.125 --> 01:04:46.500
-I'll be sending you money so--
-So you're taking my son?

01:04:51.125 --> 01:04:53.375
-That was our plan--
-What plan?

01:04:53.542 --> 01:04:54.417
The plan to go there--

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.458
You do what you want,
you don't tell me anything.

01:04:57.542 --> 01:04:59.208
What plan are you talking about, Noelí?

01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:06.625
What plan?

01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:52.000
Noelí.

01:05:57.625 --> 01:05:59.417
You have to get out of bed.

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:05.250
Sweetie, you've been sleeping all day.

01:06:12.417 --> 01:06:14.417
Don't you want to get out of bed?

01:07:43.042 --> 01:07:44.458
It's pretty.

01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:53.542
It fits you well.

01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:54.750
Beautiful.

01:08:00.792 --> 01:08:01.917
Yes, this is the one.

01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:13.792
It's good. It's a bit big for you.

01:08:13.875 --> 01:08:15.417
You can wear some
sweaters underneath.

01:08:15.542 --> 01:08:17.250
Yes, you can wear a...

01:08:17.917 --> 01:08:19.292
-You look good.
-For real?

01:08:19.375 --> 01:08:21.207
-Yes.
-Thank you.

01:08:21.292 --> 01:08:22.875
Last time I saw you,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.082
you were a bit depressed.
Weren't you?

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.917
Yes, but I'm okay now.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.042
I'm doing good.

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:31.167
-I'm happy for you.
-Thank you.

01:08:31.292 --> 01:08:33.667
-It looks great on her.
-Yes.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:36.082
-She's very pretty.
-Yes.

01:08:36.167 --> 01:08:38.125
-Everything looks good on her.
-Everything does.

01:08:38.207 --> 01:08:41.750
-Is she the same one as the last time?
-Yes, we've been together for three years.

01:08:41.832 --> 01:08:43.792
-She's a beautiful girl.
-Yes, she is.

01:08:43.875 --> 01:08:45.957
And you are taking her to France now?

01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:47.667
Yes.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:49.750
That's nice.

01:08:49.832 --> 01:08:51.917
It's gonna be quite something.
But I have my doubts.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.167
No, she'll do great.

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:56.082
At her age it's so easy.

01:08:56.167 --> 01:08:57.875
She'll adapt easily.

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.500
I'll get some blush for you.

01:10:16.208 --> 01:10:18.333
The song we're about to play for you

01:10:18.417 --> 01:10:21.917
is dedicated with love and respect

01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:26.250
to two people
who are leaving our country.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.167
We wish them lots of luck
in their travel.

01:11:28.208 --> 01:11:30.792
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

01:11:33.833 --> 01:11:35.625
A surprise for you.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:37.625
Big surprise.

01:11:41.458 --> 01:11:43.000
Are you happy?

01:11:44.083 --> 01:11:45.875
Yes, I'm happy.

01:11:49.833 --> 01:11:51.500
What's that you're drinking?

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:54.833
Pink wine.

01:11:55.292 --> 01:11:56.708
Let me try it.

01:12:02.583 --> 01:12:03.875
Do you like it?

01:12:09.375 --> 01:12:11.667
It's what those people drink, right?

01:12:15.708 --> 01:12:18.458
They're losing it in there.

01:12:18.542 --> 01:12:20.292
They're falling sideways.

01:12:20.375 --> 01:12:21.833
I can see that.

01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:29.500
I love you.

01:12:44.833 --> 01:12:46.500
Let's go back to the party.

01:12:48.167 --> 01:12:49.208
Come on.

01:12:49.292 --> 01:12:51.500
You go ahead, I'm smoking.

01:12:51.583 --> 01:12:53.333
Okay. See you.

01:15:12.917 --> 01:15:14.500
What are you doing here?

01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:16.458
Come with me, babe.

01:15:45.042 --> 01:15:47.583
Hurry up.
I'll be outside.

01:16:54.458 --> 01:16:55.875
Be careful.

01:17:00.458 --> 01:17:01.875
Slowly.

01:17:28.833 --> 01:17:30.292
Stop, stop.

01:17:54.333 --> 01:17:56.167
I love you, too. A lot.
