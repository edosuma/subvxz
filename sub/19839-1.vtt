00:06.707 --> 00:09.380
<i>Previously on "Stargate SG-1":</i>

00:13.067 --> 00:16.376
First of all, I regret to inform you
that everyone on your team...

00:16.507 --> 00:18.338
...are all deceased.

00:18.867 --> 00:21.984
The year is now... 2077.

00:24.147 --> 00:26.024
It's OK, Dr. Carter.

00:26.147 --> 00:28.900
You're in the SGC.
You're gonna be fine.

00:29.027 --> 00:34.101
It's OK, Dr. Jackson.
You're in the SGC. You're gonna be fine.

00:34.227 --> 00:36.866
- Where are the rest of SG-1?
- We were hoping you could tell us.

00:36.987 --> 00:39.296
I'll return to search for the answers.

00:39.427 --> 00:41.622
I can't let you do that, Teal'c.

00:41.747 --> 00:44.864
If they're prisoners,
they're long gone from that planet.

00:44.987 --> 00:48.741
They could be moved
to any Goa'uld stronghold.

00:49.347 --> 00:53.056
Do you have any recollection
of what happened on your last mission?

00:53.187 --> 00:55.940
We have a new technology
that might help you remember.

00:56.067 --> 00:58.456
- God! What is that?
- It's OK, Colonel. It's in.

00:58.587 --> 01:02.375
It's kind of like a hi-tech
version of hypnosis.

01:05.147 --> 01:07.103
Is this really necessary?

01:07.227 --> 01:09.980
It's important that we know who
would have the technology to do this.

01:10.107 --> 01:10.903
Why?

01:11.027 --> 01:13.461
<i>Tel mak, kree. Meg tal, ah.</i>

01:13.587 --> 01:15.623
<i>Rok, kree nol. Meg tal!</i>

01:15.747 --> 01:18.056
I hereby respectfully inform you...

01:18.987 --> 01:22.741
...that I must take my leave of the SGC.

01:23.507 --> 01:26.465
Therefore I am no longer
under your command.

01:45.467 --> 01:49.665
Who spent enough time in the base to be
able to reproduce it in this kind of detail?

01:49.787 --> 01:51.539
<i>Silence!</i>

01:51.667 --> 01:55.899
We are building our forces before
the System Lords know that we are alive.

01:56.027 --> 01:58.336
But doing so is difficult
when we have to operate...

01:58.467 --> 02:00.742
...with limited knowledge
of the state of the Empire.

02:00.867 --> 02:03.222
Let me take a guess. It's just a wild guess.

02:03.347 --> 02:05.303
But that's where we come in?

02:07.747 --> 02:10.544
Our friend here is ready for a host.

02:12.587 --> 02:14.384
Tell us...

02:14.507 --> 02:17.180
Which one of you shall it be?

02:20.627 --> 02:22.777
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

02:31.267 --> 02:36.421
Welcome back, Colonel Makepeace.
Debriefing is scheduled at 1430 hours.

02:39.107 --> 02:41.063
Make a hole!

02:41.187 --> 02:44.816
- I need to find General Hammond!
- He's in his office.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.903
Colonel!

02:49.787 --> 02:52.096
We need support for three new teams.

02:52.227 --> 02:55.822
- It's a big galaxy out there, Major.
- Sir!

02:56.667 --> 02:59.625
Colonel Makepeace, I'm sure
you remember Major Davis.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.499
Yes, sir. I apologise.

03:01.627 --> 03:05.097
When scouting 2-5-4, we came across
several members of the Tok'ra.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.183
They told us the location of SG-1.

03:07.307 --> 03:10.299
- Where are they?
- They've been taken prisoner, sir.

03:10.427 --> 03:12.383
By Hathor.

04:15.387 --> 04:18.743
<i>Why do I feel I'm looking
at blueprints of my own base?</i>

04:18.867 --> 04:20.822
In a way, you are, sir.

04:20.947 --> 04:24.986
The entire section of the facility
is a mock-up of the SGC.

04:25.107 --> 04:26.665
It's damn peculiar.

04:26.787 --> 04:31.224
Unlike Cheyenne Mountain, the Tok'ra
say the base's exterior is unguarded.

04:31.347 --> 04:34.464
We shouldn't face any resistance
until we're inside.

04:34.587 --> 04:39.138
- Even then, it'll be light.
- Can we trust them? The Tok'ra?

04:39.267 --> 04:44.022
Their operative took a big risk just
to get us this information. I think so.

04:44.147 --> 04:47.503
If they have someone on the inside,
why can't they do something?

04:47.627 --> 04:49.583
They did do something, Major.

04:49.707 --> 04:52.426
- You have the coordinates?
- Yes, sir. We're ready to go.

04:52.547 --> 04:54.503
And you will, but not alone.

04:54.627 --> 04:58.142
Sergeant, I'd like you to get me
the President on the phone.

04:58.267 --> 05:02.943
I want every available SG team ready
in the gate room within two hours.

05:03.067 --> 05:06.423
Do you intend to commit the resources
of this entire command?

05:06.547 --> 05:10.984
I only wish we could. Half of our teams
are off-world now on other missions.

05:11.107 --> 05:13.780
General, that's not my point.

05:14.947 --> 05:20.021
<i>SG-1 is a valuable asset,
but they're still just one team.</i>

05:22.267 --> 05:26.385
Major, you've got a lot to learn
about how we do things around here.

05:26.507 --> 05:31.262
- I have the President for you, sir.
- Let's get the job done.

05:37.707 --> 05:41.541
<i>We have MALP telemetry.
Tactical is go. Environmental is go.</i>

05:41.667 --> 05:44.022
You've all been briefed on the mission...

05:44.147 --> 05:45.899
...by Colonel Makepeace.

05:48.027 --> 05:49.983
You know the enemy.

05:50.707 --> 05:52.663
You know the risks.

05:55.347 --> 05:57.303
What I'm trying to say is...

05:57.427 --> 06:00.021
I would rather not order you to do this,...

06:00.107 --> 06:05.135
...so I would like all of those willing
to attempt the rescue of SG-1...

06:05.267 --> 06:07.735
...to take one step...

06:11.307 --> 06:15.744
Very well. SG Units
Three, Five, Six and Eleven,...

06:15.867 --> 06:18.222
...bring them home.

06:19.427 --> 06:22.021
- Good luck, Colonel.
- Yes, sir!

06:22.107 --> 06:24.257
All right, let's go! Move out!

06:48.387 --> 06:50.343
We ask you once more.

06:52.227 --> 06:54.183
Which one of you...

06:55.467 --> 06:57.423
...shall be host...

06:58.147 --> 07:00.103
...to our new friend?

07:01.707 --> 07:03.823
- It has her eyes.
- Silence!

07:07.107 --> 07:09.496
Shall it be...

07:09.627 --> 07:11.583
...our beloved?

07:13.387 --> 07:16.026
We could spend an eternity together.

07:16.987 --> 07:21.139
Do you not remember... the joys that
we once shared in one another's arms?

07:21.667 --> 07:23.419
I really try not to.

07:25.747 --> 07:31.105
Shall it be the female, then?
She who would challenge us.

07:34.667 --> 07:38.216
You have since been possessed
by a Goa'uld, we sense.

07:39.227 --> 07:41.980
Perhaps once more?

07:42.107 --> 07:44.985
- I'm not afraid.
- You should be, my dear.

07:45.107 --> 07:48.622
For the pain that a symbiote
can inflict in its host...

07:48.747 --> 07:50.783
...is unimaginable.

07:56.747 --> 07:59.898
It seems that our friend has chosen.

08:00.547 --> 08:03.698
What, the grey doesn't bother you?

08:06.587 --> 08:09.021
All right, fine. Let's do it.

08:10.227 --> 08:14.778
Just... please... I beg of you...
not in the back of the neck.

08:14.907 --> 08:16.863
I've got some problems...

08:21.587 --> 08:23.305
Fool!

08:23.827 --> 08:27.376
- He would've hurt the symbiote.
- Which you have done in his place!

08:27.507 --> 08:29.816
Return it to the safety of the Jaffa!

08:30.467 --> 08:34.301
Take him somewhere where
he can be properly restrained!

08:45.707 --> 08:48.938
- All right,... hold the fort!
- Yes, sir!

08:54.947 --> 08:58.701
- What have you got?
- Picking up EM one click away, sir.

08:58.827 --> 09:03.343
Probably power generation. No sign
of SG-1's IFF or radio chatter.

09:03.467 --> 09:05.105
Roger that.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.423
Bra'tac?

09:59.547 --> 10:01.503
Teal'c.

10:01.987 --> 10:05.536
You grant... a dying old man's wish.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.623
Do not speak of such things.

10:36.107 --> 10:38.063
Who has done this?

10:38.187 --> 10:43.181
The last of Apophis' personal guard.
They left me for dead.

10:43.307 --> 10:47.266
- For what reason?
- When I heard the news of Apophis,...

10:47.387 --> 10:49.378
...my heart soared, Teal'c.

10:50.827 --> 10:54.342
I hoped there would be
celebration among our people.

10:55.387 --> 10:59.346
Instead they fear that,
with the death of Apophis,...

11:00.907 --> 11:04.866
...Klorel will return...
to claim his inheritance.

11:05.507 --> 11:07.065
They are cowards.

11:07.187 --> 11:12.341
In too great a number...
for an old man of 135.

11:14.387 --> 11:16.343
What of your human friends?

11:16.467 --> 11:18.742
Prisoners of the Goa'uld.

11:19.267 --> 11:22.418
I have come to raise an army
with which to free them.

11:22.547 --> 11:24.583
That will not be so easy, Teal'c.

11:24.707 --> 11:27.460
Perhaps. But I must try.

11:28.907 --> 11:31.785
Until then, you are in need
of food and rest...

11:32.947 --> 11:35.541
<i>.. and I am in need of armour.</i>

11:43.747 --> 11:45.703
We are not pleased.

11:48.107 --> 11:50.462
Neither are we.

12:01.027 --> 12:02.426
Agh!

12:02.547 --> 12:05.141
Once host to a Goa'uld,...

12:05.227 --> 12:08.378
...you will take the lives of your friends.

12:11.107 --> 12:14.577
- We don't think so.
- You will have no say in the matter.

12:14.707 --> 12:19.258
You will witness their deaths
through your own eyes.

12:23.267 --> 12:25.223
Helplessly.

12:28.747 --> 12:32.103
It may take some time
for the Goa'uld to take control,...

12:32.227 --> 12:38.177
...but we will greatly enjoy
experiencing your eventual defeat.

12:52.627 --> 12:55.699
Oh, God! No!

12:57.907 --> 13:02.742
And when you awaken
from the joining, you will kneel...

13:02.867 --> 13:06.303
...and pledge your loyalty...

13:06.427 --> 13:07.826
...to us.

13:24.147 --> 13:26.342
<i>Jaffa! Kree mel!</i>

13:39.027 --> 13:43.384
- Look out! Over there! Over there!
- Secure the forward area!

13:45.867 --> 13:48.301
<i>Jaffa. Lok shak, tal makka kree!</i>

14:02.867 --> 14:05.620
<i>O'Neill, you must fight it.</i>

14:06.227 --> 14:10.186
I am Tok'ra. The cryogenic process
will prevent the melding.

14:10.307 --> 14:15.062
The Goa'uld within will die,
but until then you must fight it!

14:41.987 --> 14:43.943
Three o'clock! Three o'clock!

14:44.627 --> 14:47.221
<i>Jama! Chel'ets!</i>

15:10.507 --> 15:12.657
Yeah, there's no place like home!

15:12.787 --> 15:15.221
The area's secure! Let's move out!

15:25.427 --> 15:29.215
Surrender your prisoners
and drop your weapon! Now!

15:34.227 --> 15:37.185
- Colonel Makepeace.
- Where's Colonel O'Neill?

15:37.307 --> 15:39.537
He's been taken as a host.

15:39.667 --> 15:41.100
What?

16:07.027 --> 16:08.779
<i>Jaffa! Kree!</i>

16:09.627 --> 16:12.539
<i>Kel nok shree Jaffa!</i>

16:12.667 --> 16:14.623
I am of the Tok'ra.

16:14.747 --> 16:19.025
<i>If the Tauri do not destroy you,
know this: we will.</i>

16:29.187 --> 16:33.180
- All secure. Whenever you're ready.
- Stand by. We're pulling out.

16:33.307 --> 16:35.263
ETA is five minutes.

16:35.947 --> 16:38.097
Sir, something's happening here!

16:39.387 --> 16:41.343
Razor! Come in, Razor!

16:41.467 --> 16:44.425
SG-3, we have lost radio contact.
Please respond.

16:44.547 --> 16:47.823
- What's the situation?
- My team was covering the Stargate.

16:47.947 --> 16:49.699
We're moving out!

16:49.827 --> 16:52.057
- What about Jack?
- He's a casualty.

16:52.187 --> 16:53.859
If we can get him back...

16:53.987 --> 16:58.538
If my team has lost control of
the Stargate, we're not going anywhere.

16:58.667 --> 17:02.626
Now, let's go, people!
We're pulling out! Let's go!

17:13.067 --> 17:15.217
I know you!

17:17.787 --> 17:20.381
<i>Shol'va! You dare return to Chulak?</i>

17:20.467 --> 17:23.425
The people of this world
are my brothers and sisters.

17:23.547 --> 17:26.983
- I have betrayed no one.
- Except your God.

17:28.426 --> 17:32.500
- False God. Dead false God.
- So you say.

17:33.107 --> 17:35.063
But his son lives.

17:37.907 --> 17:42.697
With you or without, he will be
defeated... as was his father.

17:42.827 --> 17:44.783
Our people will taste freedom.

17:44.907 --> 17:47.660
Bra'tac paid a heavy price
for those words.

17:51.627 --> 17:55.176
Tell your kinsmen that Teal'c
has returned to Chulak!

17:55.307 --> 17:58.538
You will go to every home
of every warrior in this city.

17:58.667 --> 18:03.422
<i>You will tell them that I will speak
at the house of Bra'tac at dawn!</i>

18:03.547 --> 18:05.503
Summon them!

18:22.267 --> 18:24.223
No sign of my men.

18:25.347 --> 18:27.303
Or the enemy.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.062
Cover your flank!

18:55.107 --> 18:56.745
Open fire!

19:08.907 --> 19:12.104
- What the hell is it?
- An impenetrable energy barrier.

19:12.227 --> 19:14.297
<i>Jaffa, ha'tak!</i>

19:14.427 --> 19:16.782
Fall back! Fall back!

19:29.267 --> 19:31.417
Into the tree line!

19:44.387 --> 19:45.866
Daniel!

19:46.787 --> 19:48.903
Daniel, let's go!

20:16.787 --> 20:19.381
This way! This way to me!

20:35.067 --> 20:37.740
Secure that flank! Secure that flank!

20:42.347 --> 20:44.736
- Is anybody behind you?
- No!

20:44.867 --> 20:46.539
Tok'ra tunnels!

20:46.667 --> 20:48.862
- They have an operative on the inside.
- Who?

20:48.987 --> 20:51.740
Don't know. Don't expect
to find out any time soon.

20:51.867 --> 20:55.940
- How's the leg? Can you walk?
- It's just a deep gash, but it'll be fine.

20:56.067 --> 20:59.776
Sierra Golf six. Sierra Golf six.
This is three-niner. Come in.

20:59.907 --> 21:02.740
- They could've made the tree line.
- Yeah, maybe.

21:02.867 --> 21:06.746
If we can't penetrate their barrier,
maybe we can go under it.

21:06.867 --> 21:08.823
It's worth a try.

21:11.667 --> 21:14.420
They have fled into tunnels
of Tok'ra construction.

21:14.547 --> 21:18.699
- There must be a spy amongst us.
- The spy has been taken care of.

21:18.827 --> 21:21.182
Take as many of the humans
as you can alive.

21:21.307 --> 21:25.186
They will make an excellent addition
to our new army of Jaffa.

21:41.027 --> 21:43.461
I guess we can't go under it either.

21:44.627 --> 21:48.779
This is unlike any Goa'uld shield
we've come across. It's like a solid wall.

21:48.907 --> 21:52.422
The power output for something
like this must be enormous.

21:52.547 --> 21:56.506
That's fascinating, Captain, but...
now what do we do?

22:04.067 --> 22:06.217
How long are they overdue?

22:06.347 --> 22:08.303
Five hours, sir.

22:09.347 --> 22:13.306
The plan called for SG-3 to check in
by now if they lost contact.

22:13.427 --> 22:15.383
We'll send a message through the gate.

22:15.507 --> 22:19.216
MALP's relay antenna might be able
to get a signal to our teams.

22:19.347 --> 22:21.303
Stand by to engage!

22:35.627 --> 22:37.583
<i>Kree! Chaapa-ai!</i>

22:47.187 --> 22:48.745
Wormhole established.

22:57.947 --> 23:00.586
<i>- SG-3, this is General Hammond.
- Hold up!</i>

23:01.187 --> 23:02.745
This is Hammond. Over.

23:04.067 --> 23:07.343
The energy barrier must be
amplifying the signal.

23:07.467 --> 23:10.504
General, this is three-niner.
We hear you, sir.

23:10.627 --> 23:13.983
<i>- What's your status?
- Two surviving SG-1 team members.</i>

23:14.107 --> 23:16.063
<i>We're cut off from the Stargate.</i>

23:16.187 --> 23:19.065
We found cover in tunnels
made by the Tok'ra.

23:19.187 --> 23:21.940
We cannot reach the Stargate
without reinforcements.

23:22.067 --> 23:26.424
See if you can direct MALP's camera
to get a picture of the Stargate.

23:26.547 --> 23:28.503
That'll take some time, Colonel.

23:28.627 --> 23:31.744
<i>We'll try to send reinforcements
through the Stargate...</i>

23:31.867 --> 23:33.823
...exactly six hours from now.

23:33.947 --> 23:37.337
- Coordinate your offensive accordingly.
- Roger that, sir.

23:56.267 --> 23:59.304
Colonel Makepeace, come in!
Colonel Makepeace!

23:59.427 --> 24:01.179
Damn.

24:05.147 --> 24:07.741
One armoured platoon
could take the Stargate.

24:07.827 --> 24:09.818
General, sir...

24:09.947 --> 24:12.666
I'm sorry. It's not up to me.

24:13.347 --> 24:15.417
Even if it was, I don't agree with you.

24:15.547 --> 24:18.698
I don't really give a damn
if you agree with me, Major.

24:18.827 --> 24:20.977
With all due respect, you took a shot...

24:21.107 --> 24:24.258
...based on intelligence
you thought trustworthy, but...

24:24.387 --> 24:26.343
I promised reinforcements.

24:26.467 --> 24:31.097
The President and Joint Chiefs
will not risk further loss of life, sir.

24:31.227 --> 24:34.105
Those are their orders.

24:34.227 --> 24:36.183
I'm sorry.

24:36.307 --> 24:39.504
I'm afraid if your people
are gonna make it back,...

24:39.627 --> 24:42.619
...they're gonna have to do it on their own.

24:42.747 --> 24:44.897
I see.

24:45.027 --> 24:48.576
- Thank you, Major.
- Thank you, sir.

25:04.267 --> 25:08.704
Sir, I've been thinking. The barrier
extends for miles around the facility.

25:08.827 --> 25:12.058
It must be powered from the inside -
a field generator.

25:12.187 --> 25:15.145
The Tok'ra use these tunnels
to access the facility.

25:15.267 --> 25:17.383
- They must lead to it somehow.
- Right.

25:17.507 --> 25:19.657
Let me go back and try to shut it down.

25:19.787 --> 25:22.585
- I'll go with you.
- No, Daniel, you're hurt.

25:22.707 --> 25:24.663
I'll send an SG team as backup.

25:24.787 --> 25:30.339
If I knock out the generator, you'll
need everyone to take on those towers.

25:33.107 --> 25:34.665
All right.

25:34.787 --> 25:39.144
If you can, blow the generator
just before reinforcements come through.

25:39.267 --> 25:41.622
We'll try to take on the towers
at the same time.

25:41.747 --> 25:44.341
That might give us
the advantage we need.

25:47.147 --> 25:49.581
- I'll try to hold the door open.
- Good luck.

25:49.707 --> 25:52.096
All right, people, let's go! Move out!

26:36.627 --> 26:38.743
Teal'c has returned...

26:38.867 --> 26:40.823
...from the Tauri.

26:47.427 --> 26:50.066
If you care for this world...

26:50.187 --> 26:52.143
...and for our people,...

26:52.267 --> 26:55.225
...you will listen to what he has to say.

27:18.507 --> 27:20.463
The Goa'uld are not gods.

27:21.267 --> 27:22.825
<i>Shol'va!</i>

27:22.947 --> 27:25.097
It is a lie we live each day!

27:25.227 --> 27:28.617
Only when he takes a host
does a Goa'uld become strong.

27:29.907 --> 27:33.695
Even then, only as strong
as the Jaffa who serve them.

27:36.147 --> 27:38.103
Without us,...

27:39.227 --> 27:40.979
...the Goa'uld are nothing!

27:41.107 --> 27:43.575
- Lies!
- We are their strength!

27:44.107 --> 27:46.177
We are their power...

27:46.307 --> 27:48.741
...until we choose to serve them no more!

27:51.907 --> 27:54.705
I was witness to
the final breath of Apophis.

27:54.827 --> 27:58.820
I watched him tremble with fear
of what lay beyond!

27:58.947 --> 28:03.896
I believed that day would be
honoured for all time on Chulak.

28:08.347 --> 28:10.303
But instead,...

28:11.467 --> 28:15.096
...I see Jaffa taking up arms
against one another.

28:18.467 --> 28:20.423
I see cowardice...

28:22.347 --> 28:24.303
...and I am ashamed.

28:29.067 --> 28:31.217
This is our time.

28:34.147 --> 28:37.059
It will not come again.

28:38.587 --> 28:40.976
But first we must grow stronger...

28:41.107 --> 28:44.065
...as the people of the Tauri have done.

28:47.547 --> 28:50.698
I call for warriors to join me
through the Chaapa-ai!

28:50.827 --> 28:56.185
To gather weapons, to forge alliances
with other Jaffa who seek freedom.

28:56.307 --> 29:01.256
To show the Goa'uld we will do battle
with them wherever they may be.

29:05.747 --> 29:07.703
Who will join me?

29:50.547 --> 29:51.900
General!

29:52.027 --> 29:55.383
Not what I'd call an army, but it's a start.

29:57.187 --> 29:58.540
Hammond...

29:58.667 --> 30:00.180
...of Texas.

30:00.987 --> 30:02.739
Master Bra'tac.

30:02.867 --> 30:05.620
Gentlemen, I need your help.

30:22.987 --> 30:26.775
Forgive me. There was no other way.

30:27.347 --> 30:29.702
You're the Tok'ra.

30:30.267 --> 30:32.223
Those controls are set.

30:33.307 --> 30:35.263
Activate them.

30:47.067 --> 30:49.023
The Goa'uld within has gone.

30:49.707 --> 30:52.062
The cryogenic process destroyed it...

30:52.187 --> 30:55.657
...before it had a chance
to meld with the host.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.937
He will revive automatically.

31:11.187 --> 31:13.143
Colonel?

31:14.107 --> 31:17.861
I don't feel its presence.
You're gonna be all right.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.623
We had hopes for you.

31:46.827 --> 31:48.783
We will destroy you for this!

31:49.587 --> 31:53.739
<i>We would just like you to go away!</i>

32:07.587 --> 32:09.543
Carter!

32:09.667 --> 32:12.545
Sir... What happened?

32:12.667 --> 32:14.703
Oh, God!

32:17.627 --> 32:19.060
Hathor's...

32:20.187 --> 32:22.064
...uh... gone.

32:22.947 --> 32:27.099
- What about you?
- Cold. I'm a little chilly.

32:27.867 --> 32:29.778
But...

32:30.467 --> 32:31.820
...I'm me.

32:31.947 --> 32:33.903
I'm me.

32:34.747 --> 32:38.535
Colonel Makepeace came through
with half a dozen SG teams to rescue us.

32:38.667 --> 32:42.376
But Trofsky's cut us off from the Stargate
using an energy barrier.

32:42.507 --> 32:45.738
It originates from
somewhere in this facility.

32:45.867 --> 32:50.418
The plan is to blow it before
General Hammond sends reinforcements.

32:52.827 --> 32:55.182
And how do we plan to do that?

32:56.507 --> 33:00.659
What you seek is hidden within
the mock-up of your Stargate facility.

33:00.787 --> 33:02.982
What about you?

33:03.107 --> 33:05.462
My symbiote may yet heal me.

33:06.627 --> 33:09.778
You must hurry. Go.

33:18.267 --> 33:21.737
What exactly are we looking for?
We don't have much time.

33:21.827 --> 33:24.978
As you said, the gate is carefully guarded.

33:26.187 --> 33:29.259
The Stargate is most defensible.

33:29.387 --> 33:34.541
To be assured of victory,
we will require an advantage.

33:34.667 --> 33:39.821
One hidden away and forgotten
when I was still First Prime of Apophis.

33:39.947 --> 33:43.383
- Why?
- Few pilots could master it.

33:43.507 --> 33:45.463
And how long ago was it?

33:45.587 --> 33:47.942
Some... hundred years.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.178
The forest has changed much in that time.

33:54.427 --> 33:58.864
There is an old Jaffa saying:
They do not build them as they once did.

33:58.987 --> 34:00.943
Here!

34:05.707 --> 34:09.255
- Do you intend to fly this thing?
- Not I.

34:10.226 --> 34:14.186
Threading the needle...
is a skill for the young.

34:22.987 --> 34:28.380
The barrier extends around the facility for
miles. The generators must be massive.

34:38.547 --> 34:42.699
We're getting close. I'm getting
energy readings off the scale.

34:47.547 --> 34:51.096
She was right, sir.
The generator's somewhere in here.

34:58.827 --> 35:01.421
- What do you think?
- Try it.

35:12.787 --> 35:14.937
Found 'em.

35:23.427 --> 35:25.577
Set to detonate by remote?

35:25.707 --> 35:27.663
Yeah.

36:11.427 --> 36:13.782
This part of your plan, Captain?

36:20.587 --> 36:21.940
No, sir.

36:22.067 --> 36:26.583
<i>I know that you are
still up there, Captain Carter!</i>

36:26.707 --> 36:29.062
I grow tired of this!

36:31.307 --> 36:36.984
Surrender now... or your friends
will be killed one by one!

36:37.107 --> 36:39.462
- Don't listen to him, Sam!
- Silence!

36:42.587 --> 36:45.545
I will give you one minute!

36:52.667 --> 36:56.216
The reinforcements should come soon.
We could detonate the C4.

36:56.347 --> 37:01.580
No, Trofsky is gonna start shooting
any minute. We gotta buy some time.

37:03.707 --> 37:06.779
- He thinks I'm a Goa'uld, right?
- Right.

37:08.307 --> 37:12.664
Right. Blow that C4 the minute
the cavalry comes through that gate.

37:12.787 --> 37:15.221
<i>- What if they don't?
- What if they don't?</i>

37:15.347 --> 37:17.702
They will... They will.

37:34.307 --> 37:37.140
<i>Jaffa kree!</i>

37:37.267 --> 37:39.940
<i>Kel mak, Goa'uld! Kree tak!</i>

37:42.747 --> 37:46.899
<i>- You heard me! I said kree!
- Jack?</i>

37:47.027 --> 37:49.621
Hey, guys. Makepeace!

37:49.707 --> 37:51.663
Nice rescue! Good job!

37:51.787 --> 37:53.937
- Silence!
- All right, listen up!

37:54.067 --> 37:58.106
Something you should know before
you start shootin' and killin'...

37:58.227 --> 38:03.221
...and ruinin' what could be
the start of a beautiful friendship!

38:07.107 --> 38:09.063
Our beloved Hathor...

38:10.547 --> 38:12.299
...is dead.

38:14.507 --> 38:16.862
What you say is impossible.

38:16.987 --> 38:21.299
Hathor is a queen.
More than that, she is a goddess!

38:22.787 --> 38:25.540
Yeah, OK. Ex-goddess, maybe.

38:26.827 --> 38:28.783
I killed her myself.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.977
You should trust me on this.

38:31.107 --> 38:34.861
She's gone. She is no more. She's...

38:36.027 --> 38:38.382
Let's face it, she's a former queen.

38:39.947 --> 38:44.975
- So why don't we put an end to it?
- We will end it with your surrender!

38:48.707 --> 38:50.937
<i>Jaffa kree! Chaapa-ai!</i>

38:51.587 --> 38:54.260
Firing the weapon
will be your responsibility.

38:54.387 --> 38:56.218
Understood.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.105
Now.

39:13.547 --> 39:15.856
What did he mean by
threading the needle?

39:15.987 --> 39:17.625
Observe.

39:32.747 --> 39:34.544
Get down!

39:40.667 --> 39:43.022
Colonel!

39:55.587 --> 39:57.305
Fire!

40:04.147 --> 40:06.741
Yeehaaaaaaa!

40:19.707 --> 40:21.663
<i>Jaffa! Tal bet!</i>

40:23.227 --> 40:25.821
<i>Tal bet!</i>

40:36.547 --> 40:38.697
- Bra'tac.
- Human.
