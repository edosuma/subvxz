01:29.654 --> 01:32.092
-One push...

01:33.267 --> 01:34.659
-He hit his head.
-He did not.

01:34.703 --> 01:35.921
Did he just hit
his head?

01:35.965 --> 01:37.097
No, he just caught him.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.359
But he hit the floor.
I saw him.

01:38.402 --> 01:39.447
-No, he didn't.
-You dropped him!

01:39.490 --> 01:40.926
Sweetheart,
I promise you. He's fine.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.580
-Why isn't he crying?

01:42.624 --> 01:44.147
-He'll be crying...
-He should be crying,
right?

01:44.191 --> 01:45.757
He will be crying
in no time.

01:45.801 --> 01:48.586
Where are you taking him?

01:48.630 --> 01:51.676
-What... What is wrong?

01:51.720 --> 01:53.156
Why isn't he breathing?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.245
Did you kill him?
No!

01:55.289 --> 01:56.507
Did you kill my baby?

01:56.551 --> 01:58.030
-I saw him breathing.

01:58.074 --> 01:59.989
-Did you drop him?
-No! I did not.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.730
-You made me have him.
-The nurse is getting him.

02:01.773 --> 02:03.384
Yes, we are! We're...

02:09.172 --> 02:11.174
-Why are you
flinging him?

03:06.273 --> 03:08.492
I accidentally drank
mouthwash Friday night.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.715
You can't get stomach cancer
that way...

03:14.672 --> 03:16.196
Not from one time.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.503
I drank a mouthful
a couple weeks ago, too.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.506
I'm sure it's fine.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.577
I'm visiting my mother
tomorrow.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.754
I know you are.
Your father's anniversary.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.887
The day he died.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.587
How you feeling about that?

04:02.633 --> 04:05.201
You know,
I never met him.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.727
I meant how you feeling
about going home.

04:17.126 --> 04:18.519
I had that dream again.

04:20.651 --> 04:23.175
Let's stay on track.

04:23.219 --> 04:25.743
How are you feeling
about the trip?

04:29.051 --> 04:30.400
It's good I'm going back.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.403
It's been a long time.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.319
Has it?

04:38.626 --> 04:39.714
Several months.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.935
Are you feeling guilty
about that?

04:56.121 --> 04:57.297
And, um,

04:58.689 --> 05:01.083
when you're out there,

05:01.126 --> 05:03.781
are you going with
any sense of a plan?

05:04.608 --> 05:06.393
Hoping for a certain outcome?

05:08.438 --> 05:09.700
Like what?

05:11.702 --> 05:15.053
Do you feel like you're going
with realistic expectations?

05:22.017 --> 05:23.714
If the last time
you were thirsty,

05:23.758 --> 05:26.543
you went to a well and
the water made you sick,

05:26.587 --> 05:28.850
are you gonna go back
to that specific well,

05:28.893 --> 05:30.678
expecting it to be safe?

05:39.077 --> 05:40.078
Hmm.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.526
Do you ever wish
that she was dead?

05:53.265 --> 05:54.571
What?

05:54.615 --> 05:56.747
Of course not!

05:56.791 --> 05:59.489
Well, it wouldn't
be so crazy if you did.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.273
We can sort of want
these things

06:01.317 --> 06:03.580
and also not want them at all.

06:03.624 --> 06:06.453
Those feelings can coexist.

06:06.496 --> 06:10.021
We're here so we can air
those kinds of thoughts.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.374
-Okay.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.857
How's the Hydrotipnol?
Still making the eyes itchy?

06:20.989 --> 06:23.034
Only if I don't keep blinking.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.775
Is it helping the anxiety?

06:26.995 --> 06:28.388
Um...

06:29.389 --> 06:30.781
Tell you what,

06:30.825 --> 06:35.351
I'm gonna write you a script
for a very cool new drug

06:36.483 --> 06:38.876
which I think

06:38.920 --> 06:42.402
should be smoother
on all fronts.

06:46.362 --> 06:48.538
Always with water.

06:48.582 --> 06:52.412
Always. And if your breathing
changes or you feel warm,

06:52.455 --> 06:54.414
call me immediately.
That's serious.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.416
Break a leg.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.027
Hi, carrot, it's Mom.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.507
I'm just calling to say that

07:00.550 --> 07:02.683
I'm so, so, so excited
to see you tomorrow.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.206
- Joseph?
- You're my angel,

07:04.249 --> 07:06.251
and I love you.

07:06.295 --> 07:09.994
Okay. I love you. Okay.
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.174
Listen to your mother

07:16.218 --> 07:19.177
when I tell you
to not leave my side!

07:26.533 --> 07:28.230
Hello.

07:28.273 --> 07:30.101
-Can I please see this one?
-That one?

07:30.145 --> 07:31.363
You think I won't!

07:32.408 --> 07:34.236
Do you fucking want me
to do it?

07:36.194 --> 07:37.195
Oh, yeah?

07:40.590 --> 07:41.983
Beep beep!

07:42.026 --> 07:43.898
Excuse me.
What is that man doing?

07:43.941 --> 07:46.030
We're trying
to get him to jump.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.886
Shut up, bitch!
Fuck you!

08:17.845 --> 08:19.324
-Get away from me.
-Stop fucking with me!

08:19.368 --> 08:21.588
Get away from me.
You get away from me.

08:21.631 --> 08:22.937
Chicken noodle for you.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.460
-Get away.
-You look like

08:24.504 --> 08:25.548
a minestrone man.

08:25.592 --> 08:26.941
-Fuck you!
-Stay away!

08:26.984 --> 08:28.595
It's hot!

08:28.638 --> 08:30.161
Jeez,
we're running low on crackers.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.951
Hey, Dad.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.180
Search
continues for the man

10:16.224 --> 10:18.226
known as
"Birthday Boy Stab Man,"

10:18.269 --> 10:21.490
who in the last week
has claimed three more lives.

10:21.533 --> 10:24.101
He is known for prowling
the streets without clothes

10:24.145 --> 10:26.277
and stabbing
random pedestrians

10:26.321 --> 10:28.018
in the neck and guts.

10:28.062 --> 10:31.456
Witnesses have identified him
as a circumcised white male...

13:57.967 --> 13:59.055
Hello?

14:02.319 --> 14:04.756
- Help!

14:04.800 --> 14:06.062
Please help!

14:06.106 --> 14:08.630
-I need some sleep!

14:11.546 --> 14:13.287
-Oh, yeah?

14:37.659 --> 14:38.878
Come on, dance!

16:23.460 --> 16:26.550
Excuse me, sir? My bag
and my key were just here.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.900
You're fucked, pal.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.382
Hey, wait a minute.
Why would you say that?

16:36.865 --> 16:39.563
- Hello?
-Oh, hi, Mrs. Wolski.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.913
This is Beau Wassermann
from apartment 303.

16:41.957 --> 16:43.219
I'm calling because
my keys were...

16:43.263 --> 16:44.481
No, please, no solicitors!

16:44.525 --> 16:45.787
No, no. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not a solicitor,

16:45.830 --> 16:47.876
I'm one of your tenants.
I need a locksmith.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.182
-I'm late for the airport.
-Thank you.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.444
-Hello?

16:51.314 --> 16:52.489
Hello?

17:09.419 --> 17:10.638
- Hello?
-Hi, Martha.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.379
I'm sorry, is Mom there?

17:12.422 --> 17:14.772
Beau! Sweetie!
Yes, she's right here.

17:18.907 --> 17:19.908
Beau?

17:20.822 --> 17:22.780
Hi, Mom.

17:22.824 --> 17:25.609
Hi... Hi, carrot.
Are you at the airport?

17:27.568 --> 17:29.048
No, not yet.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.223
Are you on your way?

17:30.266 --> 17:31.180
-Are you in the cab?
-No, Mom...

17:31.224 --> 17:32.703
How long is the cab ride?

17:32.747 --> 17:35.184
Mom, I...
I don't want to worry you,

17:35.228 --> 17:36.229
I was on my way,

17:36.881 --> 17:38.492
but something, uh...

17:38.535 --> 17:39.667
I don't know.
I was up all night

17:39.710 --> 17:40.929
because my neighbor
kept leaving notes

17:40.972 --> 17:42.452
underneath my door
about noise,

17:42.496 --> 17:44.150
even though
I didn't make any noise.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.326
And I overslept,
and when I went to leave,

17:46.369 --> 17:48.110
I forgot something,
I went back in.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.069
And then
I came back out and...

17:50.112 --> 17:52.158
and my key was stolen
out of my door.

17:53.463 --> 17:54.464
Oh, my God.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.816
So where are you
calling me from now?

18:00.166 --> 18:01.428
My apartment.

18:03.604 --> 18:07.216
Wait, what time is it?
Isn't it 4:30?

18:08.261 --> 18:09.479
Yeah, I know.

18:09.523 --> 18:12.134
Baby, your flight
is in an hour!

18:12.178 --> 18:15.703
I know, but Mom, my key
got stolen out of my door.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.014
Mom?

18:27.193 --> 18:28.324
Mom!

18:36.419 --> 18:38.334
Mom...

18:38.378 --> 18:40.684
Okay, sweetheart.
I understand.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.295
Wait, what's okay?
No, it's not.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.427
What do you understand?

18:44.471 --> 18:47.517
No, of course it isn't.
Your keys are stolen.

18:47.561 --> 18:48.649
That's terrible.

18:49.563 --> 18:50.694
They were stolen.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.438
Then we'll just do
another visit another time.

18:56.918 --> 18:59.921
I can even come to you,
so it's not such a pain.

18:59.964 --> 19:04.055
It's not a pain,
it's never a pain.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.709
You know what?
I can still just come to you.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.798
I'm still coming,
I'm on my way. I just...

19:09.278 --> 19:10.627
What do you think I should do?

19:15.937 --> 19:17.243
What do you think I should do?

19:20.246 --> 19:22.248
I'm sure you'll do
the right thing, sweetheart.

19:25.512 --> 19:26.687
What is the right thing?

19:31.474 --> 19:33.128
What would be
the right thing for you?

19:37.567 --> 19:38.786
Do I call the police?

19:45.619 --> 19:48.056
Or maybe there's a way for me
to just still come home now.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.407
But is that safe?

19:51.451 --> 19:53.322
If... If my apartment's open
to the public,

19:53.366 --> 19:55.759
and somebody has my keys,
I don't know what's going on.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.370
I mean, it doesn't sound safe.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.632
It's not safe, is it?

19:59.807 --> 20:00.895
Beau...

20:00.938 --> 20:01.939
What?

20:08.903 --> 20:09.991
No.

20:10.644 --> 20:11.732
Yeah.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.393
I'm sorry about your keys,
sweetheart, I have to go.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.569
No, you don't have to go.

20:22.612 --> 20:23.787
-Mom...
-I hope you find them.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.267
Wait, wait,
come on, let's fix this.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.312
Let's fix this.

20:28.792 --> 20:29.880
Hello?

20:35.190 --> 20:36.539
Yo, you gonna die, bitch!

22:02.582 --> 22:04.366
Always with water.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.715
Always.

22:05.759 --> 22:06.977
Always.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.370
Always.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.630
Ahh!

23:34.674 --> 23:36.589
-Help me! Help me! Help me!

23:36.632 --> 23:38.199
-Help me! Help me! Help me!

23:38.242 --> 23:40.549
Help me! Help me! Help me!
Help me! Help me! Help me!

24:04.921 --> 24:06.575
-Declined.

24:06.619 --> 24:07.794
What?

24:07.837 --> 24:09.752
No, it's not.
Can you try again, please?

24:12.538 --> 24:13.582
No...

24:13.626 --> 24:15.628
-Oh, no.

24:17.499 --> 24:18.587
Ah, no good.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.851
Oh, God... How much?

24:21.895 --> 24:24.288
You drank already.
You owe $1.79.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.685
-Okay...
-$1.79

24:30.773 --> 24:31.905
Oh, no.

24:32.688 --> 24:34.124
Oh, ho-ho!

24:36.387 --> 24:37.650
I call the police.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.478
What? No, no, look,
I'm paying! I'm paying!

24:41.305 --> 24:43.786
-30 cents more.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.092
Oh, God...

24:49.618 --> 24:50.706
20 now.

24:52.142 --> 24:53.535
Oh, my God...
20!

24:53.579 --> 24:56.016
-I know!
-Don't curse me, my friend.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.365
I'm not the one.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.107
Oh, my God!
Five more now.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.501
There!

25:03.110 --> 25:04.546
I call the police!

25:34.097 --> 25:35.229
Mrs. Wolski?

25:45.892 --> 25:47.458
Back away!

25:47.502 --> 25:49.722
Stay away! Get away!

25:49.765 --> 25:54.117
-Oh, no! Oh, no!
-Get away! Get away!

25:54.161 --> 25:55.728
Get back! Stay away!

25:55.771 --> 25:58.208
-Get back!

26:47.344 --> 26:49.042
Get away!
Get away from me!

26:50.565 --> 26:53.481
Fuck you! Fuck you!

27:24.468 --> 27:27.080
Again! Again!
Put it back!

28:37.803 --> 28:38.847
Hello?

29:07.746 --> 29:08.921
Sir?

29:47.873 --> 29:49.048
Hello?

30:58.160 --> 30:59.770
Hi,
you've reached Mona!

30:59.814 --> 31:02.382
Leave me a message if you ever
want to speak to me again.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.167
Hi, Mom.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.953
So, I'm trying to book
a flight for tonight,

31:07.996 --> 31:09.519
but the credit card
got declined.

31:09.563 --> 31:11.217
- We're sorry.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.219
Your message
did not go through.

31:13.262 --> 31:14.350
Please hang up and...

31:26.058 --> 31:27.102
Hello?

31:27.755 --> 31:28.799
Hello?

31:30.801 --> 31:32.760
I'm sorry, who is this?

31:32.803 --> 31:34.893
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm trying to call my mom.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.158
This is your mom's number?

31:40.289 --> 31:41.377
Oh.

31:41.421 --> 31:42.813
Mm? Yeah, it is.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.033
Who... Who's this?

31:46.992 --> 31:48.080
I'm with UPS.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.386
Um...

31:50.430 --> 31:52.214
I don't know
whose phone this is.

31:52.258 --> 31:53.824
I just called the police.
They're already on their way.

31:55.826 --> 31:56.827
Oh...

31:57.785 --> 31:58.786
Okay.

32:00.222 --> 32:01.223
Why?

32:03.486 --> 32:04.487
Hello?

32:05.924 --> 32:07.099
Can you...
Can you maybe describe

32:07.142 --> 32:08.883
your mother to me?

32:09.666 --> 32:10.667
Uh...

32:11.842 --> 32:14.889
Brown eyes. Red-brown hair?

32:19.807 --> 32:22.941
Can you maybe describe
her physique?

32:23.985 --> 32:25.856
Wait, what's going on?

32:25.900 --> 32:28.424
W... Why are you calling
the police?

32:29.512 --> 32:31.210
Listen, I don't know
what this is.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.863
I have a package,

32:32.907 --> 32:35.040
and I only came in
because of the smell,

32:35.083 --> 32:37.346
and the dogs on the block
were all going crazy,

32:37.390 --> 32:39.392
and the door was open,
so I just barely came inside,

32:39.435 --> 32:40.654
but... um...

32:41.655 --> 32:44.223
there's a lady on the floor.

32:44.266 --> 32:47.530
Well, the body of a lady,
and there's no face or head.

32:49.663 --> 32:50.794
What?

32:53.188 --> 32:55.538
I don't think
I should have answered this.

32:55.582 --> 32:58.280
Police are coming.
This isn't my phone.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.413
I'm truly just finding this.

33:00.456 --> 33:04.156
I'm sorry, you don't...
makes any sense. You...

33:04.199 --> 33:06.636
What do you mean
there's no face or...

33:06.680 --> 33:08.029
or head for who?

33:09.291 --> 33:11.337
I mean, I'm sure there is.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.426
I'm sure it's here.
I'm sure it's everywhere.

33:13.469 --> 33:14.601
A chandelier...

33:15.819 --> 33:17.560
fell on top of it.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.258
And it looks like
it dropped off the ceiling

33:19.301 --> 33:20.911
and it fell on a woman.

33:20.955 --> 33:24.393
And it smashed her head,
it's like it evaporated.

33:32.532 --> 33:33.663
But who is it?

33:35.622 --> 33:36.623
What?

33:38.146 --> 33:39.278
Who is it?

33:41.323 --> 33:43.064
I don't know,
I'm trying to be tactful here.

33:43.108 --> 33:44.587
You're saying that
this could be your mom?

33:44.631 --> 33:46.502
What? I didn't say that!

33:47.199 --> 33:48.896
Why are you saying that?

33:48.939 --> 33:50.463
No, you said that to me!

33:50.506 --> 33:52.247
Look, you asked
if your mother was here.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.032
That's what I'm saying,
I don't know who this is!

33:54.075 --> 33:56.121
I just picked up the phone and
that's what you said, okay?

33:56.164 --> 33:58.862
I didn't do this!
I didn't do this! You know?

34:00.951 --> 34:02.083
I swear.

34:06.479 --> 34:07.958
Maybe you called
the wrong number.

34:10.483 --> 34:11.658
Did you dial this number?

34:13.355 --> 34:15.009
It's saved in my phone.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.882
It's saved on your phone?
Okay, maybe you misdialed.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.451
Oh, my God.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.105
Oh, my God... You...

34:24.149 --> 34:25.585
Right? Maybe you misdialed.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.152
Maybe this is all
a big misunderstanding.

34:27.195 --> 34:28.588
-You're scaring me. Okay.
-So, we should hang up...

34:28.631 --> 34:29.415
- Okay.
-...then maybe your mom...

34:29.458 --> 34:30.764
-your mom will pick up.
-Okay

34:30.807 --> 34:32.418
That... Okay.
Hang up. Call back.

34:32.461 --> 34:33.506
No, I'm sorry...

34:42.863 --> 34:44.169
I'm so sorry.

34:47.737 --> 34:48.999
I'm so sorry.

34:53.613 --> 34:57.704
Do I have your permission to
check her purse for some ID?

34:57.747 --> 34:59.749
Since it's more likely now
that this is your mom?

35:02.143 --> 35:03.275
Hello?

35:14.416 --> 35:16.984
Is her name...

35:18.116 --> 35:19.508
Mona Wassermann?

35:21.249 --> 35:22.424
Is that your mother?

35:25.210 --> 35:26.211
Hello?

35:30.040 --> 35:31.520
Mona Wassermann?
Is that your mom?

35:37.091 --> 35:38.701
Hey. Hey, m...

35:39.963 --> 35:41.139
Is there somebody there?

37:03.482 --> 37:05.658
Hi, you've
reached Dr. Jeremy Friel.

37:05.701 --> 37:07.268
Please leave a message,

37:07.312 --> 37:09.749
and I'll return your call
as soon as I'm able.

37:09.792 --> 37:10.924
I'm so sorry.

38:24.389 --> 38:25.433
Please.

38:25.955 --> 38:27.000
Please.

39:02.252 --> 39:03.471
No, no...

39:34.676 --> 39:36.809
Help! Help!

39:45.818 --> 39:47.733
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

39:47.776 --> 39:49.430
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

39:49.474 --> 39:50.518
-Fuck you!

39:50.562 --> 39:52.172
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

39:55.784 --> 39:56.959
Police! Oh, my God!

39:57.438 --> 39:58.483
Police!

39:58.526 --> 40:01.181
-Police, please help, will ya?
-Freeze!

40:01.224 --> 40:04.227
Man in my bath,
and a man with a knife...

40:04.271 --> 40:05.968
-Freeze!
-What?

40:06.012 --> 40:08.101
First, drop the weapon!
Drop it!

40:08.144 --> 40:10.756
Drop the weapon!
Drop the weapon!

40:10.799 --> 40:13.106
Drop the weapon! Drop it.

40:13.149 --> 40:14.673
Drop the weapon! Drop it.

40:16.718 --> 40:19.329
Fuck it... What...
Dude, do not move.

40:19.373 --> 40:21.897
I fucking said do not move!

40:21.941 --> 40:23.159
Freeze!

40:23.203 --> 40:24.944
I'm freezing.
I'm freezing.

40:24.987 --> 40:26.946
-I said fucking freeze!
-I'm not moving!

40:26.989 --> 40:28.382
Trust me.
I'm not gonna say it again.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.775
I'm frozen,
I'm frozen, I'm frozen.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.167
Oh, my God,
don't make me do this.

40:31.211 --> 40:33.692
Do not make me do this,
please. Oh, please.

40:33.735 --> 40:34.954
Please, please,

40:34.997 --> 40:36.608
-don't make me do this!
-No, no.

40:36.651 --> 40:38.087
No, no, no.

40:38.131 --> 40:39.480
-Don't make me do this!

42:32.637 --> 42:34.029
I'm coming!

42:34.639 --> 42:36.118
Roger, he's awake.

42:46.259 --> 42:47.477
Did you hit the button?

42:49.131 --> 42:50.350
Are you awake?

43:01.883 --> 43:02.928
How're you feeling?

43:05.670 --> 43:08.020
Strange.

43:08.063 --> 43:10.283
I bet. You've been sleeping
for two days.

43:12.067 --> 43:13.242
What?

43:14.374 --> 43:16.550
Did I get hit with a car?

43:16.594 --> 43:19.248
There was an accident, yes.

43:19.292 --> 43:22.425
Oh, goodness...
Uh, I hit you with my car.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.605
Is that this?

43:33.741 --> 43:35.047
There was a stabbing.

43:35.830 --> 43:37.049
You were assaulted.

43:37.832 --> 43:38.877
What?

43:48.843 --> 43:51.454
Just... Why? Why?

43:52.630 --> 43:55.154
-What?
-I know!

43:55.197 --> 43:56.982
-Am I dead?
-No.

43:57.025 --> 43:59.593
No. You've been healing
so quickly.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.247
And no organs were hit,

44:01.290 --> 44:04.554
and your...
your bleeding was really mild.

44:04.598 --> 44:06.818
What, this is...
What room is this?

44:06.861 --> 44:09.124
This is a room in our house,

44:09.168 --> 44:12.084
but it's your home
for as long as you need.

44:12.127 --> 44:13.694
-My name's Grace.

44:14.303 --> 44:15.696
Oh, this is Roger.

44:15.740 --> 44:17.002
This is my husband.

44:21.833 --> 44:25.010
Hey, guy. Welcome back.

44:25.053 --> 44:26.751
Thought you'd sleep in, huh?

44:26.794 --> 44:29.449
Roger's a very
respected surgeon.

44:29.492 --> 44:32.452
He's the one who dressed
and treated your wounds.

44:32.495 --> 44:33.801
-You're a lucky man.

44:36.978 --> 44:39.415
What is... What is this?

44:39.459 --> 44:41.635
That's my little assistant
health monitor.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.245
Keeps track of your condition.

44:44.812 --> 44:46.640
Was that a dream before?

44:46.684 --> 44:48.729
-What is?
-Was that a dream?

44:48.773 --> 44:49.948
The stabbing?

44:49.991 --> 44:51.210
No, my mom.

44:52.254 --> 44:54.126
-Your...Your mommy?
-My mommy.

44:55.040 --> 44:56.998
Is my mommy dead?

44:57.042 --> 44:58.913
What was your dream, sweetie?

45:00.306 --> 45:03.439
Her head... just gone.

45:03.483 --> 45:05.790
-Her what?
- Her head.

45:05.833 --> 45:09.707
Oh, no, no, that's a dream.
That was a dream.

45:09.750 --> 45:11.491
No, her head is gone.

45:11.534 --> 45:14.494
No, no, no,
that's a bad dream. It's okay.

45:14.537 --> 45:16.975
Shh. That's a bad dream.

45:17.018 --> 45:20.065
-There you go. Shh. Oh, no.
-My mommy...

45:21.806 --> 45:24.286
Just a dream.
It's just a dream.

45:58.320 --> 45:59.495
Amen.

46:00.801 --> 46:02.107
Amen.

46:02.716 --> 46:03.804
Amen.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.374
-Amen.

46:13.858 --> 46:15.598
That's Nate. Our boy.

46:15.642 --> 46:16.686
Nathan.

46:20.212 --> 46:21.343
He's Army?

46:22.562 --> 46:24.956
82nd Airborne Division.
Caracas.

46:27.523 --> 46:28.742
Killed in action.

46:30.657 --> 46:31.876
Where's that?

46:33.747 --> 46:36.445
Oh, is it time
for dessert already?

46:36.489 --> 46:37.577
Here you go.

46:40.623 --> 46:41.929
And, uh...

46:43.365 --> 46:44.671
two for the big man.

46:49.328 --> 46:53.332
By the way, Beau, uh,
not for the dinner table,

46:53.375 --> 46:55.813
but, uh, I noticed
when you first came in,

46:57.249 --> 46:59.381
your testicles

46:59.425 --> 47:02.558
are significantly distended.

47:02.602 --> 47:05.300
Looks like a bad case
of epididymitis.

47:05.344 --> 47:07.128
Let him eat, Roger.

47:07.172 --> 47:09.087
But we should get
an ultrasound

47:09.130 --> 47:10.610
-just to be safe.

47:11.524 --> 47:12.699
Oh, Toni!

47:12.742 --> 47:13.961
Ton... Come here.

47:14.005 --> 47:15.397
-Come here.
-Oh, she's not dead,

47:15.441 --> 47:17.095
-that's nice.
-Come... Come in here.

47:19.662 --> 47:21.621
I want you to meet
our new friend.

47:21.664 --> 47:23.275
Beau, this is Toni.

47:23.318 --> 47:24.537
Toni, this is Beau.

47:25.364 --> 47:26.582
Oh, hello.

47:27.888 --> 47:30.151
You enjoying my bed
and all my stuff?

47:30.195 --> 47:32.501
-What? That's your bedroom?
-Oh, God... here we go.

47:32.545 --> 47:34.373
I didn't realize that. I'm...

47:34.416 --> 47:35.853
Beau. Take it easy.

47:35.896 --> 47:38.551
Toni's happy to give you
her room.

47:38.594 --> 47:40.074
Yeah, no.

47:40.118 --> 47:41.510
It's not like we have a
totally empty room available,

47:41.554 --> 47:43.295
completely unused.

47:43.338 --> 47:45.036
That's right.
It's not like that.

47:45.079 --> 47:46.211
You know that.

47:48.300 --> 47:49.605
I'm going to school.

47:50.345 --> 47:52.173
Honey, it's Saturday!

47:52.217 --> 47:53.871
-Don't mix those, Toni!

47:55.960 --> 47:57.222
Little asshole.

48:03.228 --> 48:06.231
Okay, so you wanna dial nine,
and then you're good.

48:06.274 --> 48:08.320
Do you have the number
you need?

48:08.363 --> 48:10.626
My mom made me memorize it.

48:10.670 --> 48:11.714
Hi, Jeeves!

48:14.413 --> 48:17.895
-Uh, Jeeves, um... He...

48:19.461 --> 48:21.986
Jeeves and my son
served together in Caracas.

48:23.117 --> 48:24.640
He was with him when he died.

48:26.077 --> 48:28.035
Oh, that's gonna be blood.

48:28.079 --> 48:29.602
Did you give him
his meds?

48:29.645 --> 48:30.908
I thought you did!

48:31.430 --> 48:32.779
All right...

48:32.822 --> 48:34.259
If you need anything,
just shout.

48:36.261 --> 48:39.046
Stay right there, Jeeves.
Sweetie, don't touch anything.

48:50.840 --> 48:51.841
Hello.

48:52.538 --> 48:53.626
Dr. Cohen?

48:56.368 --> 48:58.544
I'm not a doctor,
Beau, I'm an attorney.

48:59.458 --> 49:00.720
I'm calling about Mom.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.158
Is it true?

49:06.073 --> 49:07.205
Is what true?

49:08.771 --> 49:10.251
That she was discovered
with a collapsed head

49:10.295 --> 49:11.731
in her living room?

49:11.774 --> 49:13.341
That you were
the first person notified

49:13.385 --> 49:14.952
and it's taken three days

49:14.995 --> 49:16.823
-for anyone to hear from you?

49:17.737 --> 49:18.825
Yes, Beau,

49:19.652 --> 49:21.610
it's true.

49:21.654 --> 49:25.397
But how?
I was just speaking with her.

49:26.833 --> 49:29.183
I was coming to see her.
I was coming to see her.

49:29.227 --> 49:30.228
Shh!

49:33.274 --> 49:34.710
What...

49:34.754 --> 49:35.929
What happened?

49:37.713 --> 49:39.019
Wha... What,

49:39.063 --> 49:41.108
am I the first person
you're asking?

49:41.152 --> 49:43.676
A chandelier crushed her head!

49:47.201 --> 49:48.202
Hello?

49:49.595 --> 49:50.596
Oh, my God.

49:51.814 --> 49:52.946
Hello?

49:55.427 --> 49:56.515
What do I do?

49:57.385 --> 49:58.386
What...

49:58.952 --> 50:00.823
do...

50:00.867 --> 50:03.087
Do I call the...

50:03.130 --> 50:05.089
funeral... funeral people?

50:07.482 --> 50:08.962
About what?

50:11.138 --> 50:13.097
Do I need... to...

50:13.140 --> 50:16.578
Everyone was contacted
on the day that she was found.

50:16.622 --> 50:20.191
The burial has been
outrageously postponed.

50:23.933 --> 50:24.934
So...

50:27.024 --> 50:28.460
When...

50:28.503 --> 50:29.983
When is it now?

50:32.116 --> 50:35.467
A body is to be buried
immediately, Beau.

50:35.510 --> 50:38.209
"It shall not remain
all night."

50:38.252 --> 50:39.645
Does that ring a bell?

50:40.515 --> 50:42.082
Do you understand anything?

50:43.562 --> 50:45.346
I just woke up.

50:45.390 --> 50:46.739
I got hit by a car,

50:46.782 --> 50:48.828
-and I got stabbed.

50:52.353 --> 50:54.747
It was your mother's
unfortunate wish

50:54.790 --> 50:58.229
that she not be buried
without you present.

50:58.272 --> 51:00.318
So, we are waiting, Beau.

51:00.361 --> 51:02.842
And every minute more
that we wait

51:03.756 --> 51:06.324
only deepens the humiliation.

51:07.368 --> 51:08.935
Okay.

51:08.978 --> 51:12.286
Your mother's body
is being watched at all hours.

51:13.157 --> 51:15.463
There is no rest for her.

51:15.507 --> 51:18.640
There has been no rest
for the people that love her.

51:20.294 --> 51:22.340
You need to be here Beau,

51:22.383 --> 51:26.213
dressed in a suit,
with a eulogy.

51:27.606 --> 51:30.739
You need to stop
the humiliation.

51:30.783 --> 51:33.220
It's all that's being
asked of you.

51:35.353 --> 51:36.658
We'll keep an eye out

51:36.702 --> 51:38.312
for Your Highness's
royal carriage.

51:44.188 --> 51:45.450
Was that okay?

51:49.715 --> 51:50.846
I...

51:52.239 --> 51:54.067
I... I need to get home.

51:56.069 --> 51:58.071
I... I have to get back.

51:58.506 --> 51:59.507
Oh...

52:01.118 --> 52:02.336
Baby.

52:02.380 --> 52:04.164
-I have to get back.

52:04.208 --> 52:07.994
Paging Dr. Rog.
Dr. Rog incoming.

52:08.037 --> 52:09.822
-All right, bub.
- I need to go.

52:09.865 --> 52:11.040
A little medley here.

52:11.084 --> 52:12.259
-Now.
-Under the tongue.

52:12.303 --> 52:13.608
-Can you take me?
-Come on.

52:13.652 --> 52:15.001
-Attaboy.
-Oh, God...

52:15.044 --> 52:18.047
Oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God...

52:18.091 --> 52:19.527
How's our patient?

52:19.571 --> 52:21.268
-He needs to get back.
-Oh, I'm gonna need to go now.

52:21.312 --> 52:24.228
Is there a flight tonight
or this afternoon?

52:24.271 --> 52:25.316
-Or now?
-Oh, sweetheart,

52:25.359 --> 52:26.491
this is the afternoon.

52:26.534 --> 52:28.362
Okay, well,
can we order one or...

52:28.406 --> 52:29.929
-Whoa, partner!
-What are we gonna do?

52:29.972 --> 52:31.626
-Partner, hold your horses.
-Oh, God...

52:31.670 --> 52:33.367
He can't fly
in his condition.

52:33.411 --> 52:35.064
Yeah, I was gonna say.

52:35.108 --> 52:36.588
What's the problem,
ol' buddy?

52:36.631 --> 52:38.198
She needs to be buried.
She needs to be buried.

52:38.242 --> 52:40.679
They're waiting for me.
She's...

52:40.722 --> 52:45.074
She's humiliated.
She's humiliated, oh, so much.

52:46.119 --> 52:48.382
Beau, listen,

52:48.426 --> 52:50.384
there's nothing worse
than losing a parent.

52:51.864 --> 52:53.692
I lost my mother
when I was 11.

52:54.997 --> 52:56.303
I don't think
I ever got over it.

52:57.870 --> 53:01.265
But I promise you,
we will get you there, easy.

53:01.308 --> 53:04.093
Wasserton's only like
a six-hour drive from here.

53:04.790 --> 53:06.226
Can you take me now?

53:06.270 --> 53:10.143
But you also need to get
some serious rest, my brother.

53:10.187 --> 53:13.059
-No! I feel fine.
-And some support.

53:13.102 --> 53:14.582
When can you take me?

53:17.498 --> 53:19.370
-Couple days? Then...
-What?

53:19.413 --> 53:21.720
Then after the show,

53:21.763 --> 53:23.243
we can all swing back
here together.

53:23.287 --> 53:26.203
-Roger. Roger, please.
-As a family.

53:26.246 --> 53:29.118
Please, I need to
get back now. I need to go.

53:29.162 --> 53:31.730
Heck, Beau, if you need
to get home ASAP...

53:31.773 --> 53:33.210
Yeah.
...we're just gonna

53:33.253 --> 53:34.515
have to find a way
to take you tomorrow.

53:35.473 --> 53:37.039
What?

53:37.083 --> 53:39.128
Tomorrow... Not... Not... No.
But... But...

53:39.172 --> 53:40.739
You know what?
...  today, why not today?

53:40.782 --> 53:42.219
You're right, honey.
Tomorrow.

53:42.262 --> 53:45.091
- Roger, please...

53:45.134 --> 53:46.962
Oh...
What about today?

53:47.006 --> 53:49.922
- Not in this condition.

53:56.189 --> 53:57.669
I need
more red and blue.

54:00.193 --> 54:01.325
Hmm...

54:01.368 --> 54:02.587
I found it.

54:09.333 --> 54:10.377
All right!

54:10.421 --> 54:12.858
It's beddy-byes
for the Rog-man!

54:14.033 --> 54:16.122
Where's my blushing bride?

54:17.297 --> 54:19.473
-Yoo-hoo, babe!

54:28.874 --> 54:31.790
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
just going to the bathroom.

54:36.011 --> 54:37.448
Would you like to trade?

54:38.362 --> 54:40.059
I really don't mind.

54:43.628 --> 54:45.282
Shut my door
and get in my bed.

54:48.285 --> 54:50.722
I really, really, really
don't mind, really.

54:50.765 --> 54:52.419
I like couches.

54:52.463 --> 54:54.421
And I'm leaving tomorrow,
anyway.

55:00.122 --> 55:03.430
Well, If you do change
your mind,

55:03.474 --> 55:06.520
I'm ready to switch whenever.
I'll be happy to.

55:06.564 --> 55:08.653
I'm sorry. Thank you. Sorry.

56:11.933 --> 56:15.023
...don't know
where the fuck is it!

56:15.067 --> 56:18.070
...touch it? Why would you
touch someone else's shit?

56:19.506 --> 56:21.508
He moved my toothbrush.
He used... Did he...

56:21.552 --> 56:23.336
Did he fucking use
my toothbrush?

56:23.380 --> 56:26.165
Today's the day, Beau.
How's it feel?

56:30.038 --> 56:31.388
Is he okay with me?

56:34.608 --> 56:35.827
Eh, probably.

56:35.870 --> 56:37.568
It's just his nerves,
Beau.

56:37.611 --> 56:39.004
He's been through a lot.

56:39.047 --> 56:40.397
Just like you.

56:40.919 --> 56:42.094
Man's a hero.

56:43.008 --> 56:45.793
Okay, pal-e-o,
it's you and me!

56:45.837 --> 56:48.143
Grace unfortunately
can't join.

56:48.187 --> 56:50.319
She's got her big
shareholder meeting.

56:51.799 --> 56:53.932
Feelin' sad about
going home, Beau?

56:55.760 --> 56:57.501
Must feel totally unreal.

56:59.764 --> 57:01.243
Yeah...

57:01.287 --> 57:02.810
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.

57:06.510 --> 57:08.033
Right. So...

57:08.947 --> 57:10.775
Not "sad" exactly.

57:10.818 --> 57:13.125
I mean, yes. Of course.
I just...

57:15.519 --> 57:18.130
I think I need
to get there to even...

57:21.612 --> 57:23.527
Hey, that makes sense.

57:23.570 --> 57:26.486
That makes all the sense
in the world!

57:26.878 --> 57:27.879
Hello?

57:28.923 --> 57:29.924
Speaking.

57:31.360 --> 57:32.361
Uh-huh.

57:34.494 --> 57:35.626
When did it happen?

57:37.671 --> 57:38.890
Water skiing?

57:40.021 --> 57:42.676
Ugh. Well, yes, no, of course.

57:42.720 --> 57:44.548
Tell them to rush him over.

57:44.591 --> 57:46.811
Oh, my God!

57:47.812 --> 57:49.422
Emergency surgery.

57:49.466 --> 57:51.163
Carl Oberst
split his head open.

57:51.206 --> 57:54.340
-One of my oldest patients.

57:54.383 --> 57:56.168
Oh, G...
Well, I can't miss work today.

57:56.211 --> 57:57.299
It's all hands on deck.

57:57.343 --> 57:59.301
-Oh, my gosh, Carl.

57:59.345 --> 58:01.695
I know. Good ol' Carl.

58:01.739 --> 58:04.437
Okay... Okay...

58:05.569 --> 58:08.485
Mm...

58:13.794 --> 58:14.882
Beau,

58:15.970 --> 58:17.494
this is gonna take a while.

58:18.538 --> 58:20.932
I don't know
if today's gonna happen.

58:23.108 --> 58:24.326
Okay...

58:25.806 --> 58:27.373
What do you mean?

58:27.416 --> 58:28.766
I wanna say tonight,

58:28.809 --> 58:30.768
but I already pushed
this morning's surgeries

58:30.811 --> 58:31.899
to tomorrow.

58:33.553 --> 58:38.950
But... if I pull 'em all back
to this afternoon,

58:38.993 --> 58:42.170
we could blast off
tomorrow morning!

58:42.214 --> 58:43.998
No, but I have to go today.

58:44.042 --> 58:45.739
I... I have to leave today,
my mother...

58:45.783 --> 58:47.828
-Uh-oh!

58:51.571 --> 58:53.181
-See...

58:55.140 --> 58:56.576
-Mm-mm.

58:56.620 --> 58:57.664
Oh, Beau!

58:57.708 --> 58:59.884
You aren't healed,
my dude.

59:00.580 --> 59:02.190
Not to mention...

59:03.452 --> 59:05.846
Maybe there's a way.

59:05.890 --> 59:09.241
Since you're busy,
maybe I can... I can fly.

59:09.284 --> 59:11.809
I fly and I can pay you back
when I get my credit card.

59:11.852 --> 59:13.506
It isn't about the money,
Beau.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.247
You can't fly
with your wounds.

59:15.290 --> 59:17.728
The air pressure
will rip you wide open.

59:17.771 --> 59:18.990
Maybe I can take a bus!

59:19.033 --> 59:20.426
I can take a bus.
Can I take a bus?

59:20.469 --> 59:22.776
Or take a train? Or... Or...
Or a cab?

59:22.820 --> 59:24.778
Beau, we're responsible
for you.

59:24.822 --> 59:28.042
Driving you home is
the absolute least we can do.

59:28.086 --> 59:29.827
Thank you. Thank you.

59:29.870 --> 59:31.350
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

59:31.393 --> 59:33.395
I'm sorry,
but I have to go today.

59:33.439 --> 59:34.658
I have to go today.

59:34.701 --> 59:35.920
I don't want to impose.
I don't want to...

59:35.963 --> 59:39.053
Going tomorrow
won't be an imposition!

59:39.097 --> 59:40.751
It'll be my pleasure.

59:41.403 --> 59:42.579
Okay?

59:49.455 --> 59:50.804
How did you get me here?

59:53.154 --> 59:54.329
Is it, Beau?

59:56.201 --> 59:57.419
Don't just say that.

01:00:00.118 --> 01:00:01.772
This is your decision.

01:00:14.393 --> 01:00:17.831
Thanks, pal, you're a trouper!
Sorry for the curveball, Beau!

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:20.704
Wait, don't you need
to stitch me up?

01:00:20.747 --> 01:00:23.228
Ah, it's fine. Just cut back
on the jumping jacks,

01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:24.533
you know what I mean?

01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:28.102
In the meantime, my man,
this is your home.

01:00:28.146 --> 01:00:30.670
I need to run, too, sweetie.

01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:32.716
- There's a...
-Oh,

01:00:32.759 --> 01:00:34.239
and I'm giving Jeeves
his medicine,

01:00:34.282 --> 01:00:36.284
so if you hear him screaming,
he's just asleep.

01:00:38.504 --> 01:00:39.723
Don't forget to hydrate.

01:00:40.158 --> 01:00:41.159
What?

01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:43.683
Drink lots of water.

01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:45.946
We're taking
you back tomorrow.

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:47.992
Goodbye, sweetie.

01:00:48.035 --> 01:00:51.735
"Tomorrow
creeps in this petty pace

01:00:51.778 --> 01:00:54.346
"from day to day..."

01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:56.653
-What?

01:00:56.696 --> 01:00:58.002
What does this mean?

01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:01.658
Wait! What does that mean?

01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:02.789
Shake a leg.

01:01:12.494 --> 01:01:14.801
You've reached
the office of Harold Cohen.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.456
Leave a detailed message.

01:01:17.499 --> 01:01:19.850
I'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:24.724
Hey, Dr. Cohen.
It's Beau.

01:01:28.206 --> 01:01:29.468
I'm on my way.

01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:30.861
The mailbox is full

01:01:30.904 --> 01:01:31.992
and cannot accept
any messages at...

01:02:01.282 --> 01:02:02.849
Our senior correspondent,

01:02:02.893 --> 01:02:04.590
Brian Galloway, joins us now.

01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:06.679
Brian, what have we learnt?

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.028
All we know
at the moment is that

01:02:08.072 --> 01:02:09.508
Mona Wassermann was found dead

01:02:09.551 --> 01:02:11.423
in the living room
of her magnificent home

01:02:11.466 --> 01:02:13.904
with a chandelier
where one's head should be.

01:02:13.947 --> 01:02:15.470
Due to
extenuating circumstances,

01:02:15.514 --> 01:02:17.037
she has not yet been buried.

01:02:17.081 --> 01:02:20.780
But she must.
She was 70 years old.

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:23.652
Excuse me, sir,
you discovered the body?

01:02:23.696 --> 01:02:25.176
Look, I never would've
gone inside if...

01:02:25.219 --> 01:02:27.439
if, uh, the dogs in the street
hadn't been going nuts

01:02:27.482 --> 01:02:28.745
and I hadn't smelled
that smell

01:02:28.788 --> 01:02:30.050
and the door
hadn't been half-open.

01:02:30.094 --> 01:02:31.660
That's the only reason
I went inside.

01:02:31.704 --> 01:02:34.751
Admired by her friends
and feared by her competitors,

01:02:34.794 --> 01:02:38.189
Mona Wassermann
was a local industry titan

01:02:38.232 --> 01:02:40.408
and a force
to be reckoned with.

01:02:40.452 --> 01:02:43.150
I just can't believe it.

01:02:43.194 --> 01:02:44.761
Mona Wassermann has been...

01:02:44.804 --> 01:02:46.806
-What?

01:02:55.467 --> 01:02:56.598
What the fuck!

01:02:57.425 --> 01:02:59.079
Oh... I'm sorry!

01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:00.994
I'm sorry I was
on your computer. I threw up.

01:03:01.038 --> 01:03:02.474
I'll... I'll clean it up.
I'll clean up.

01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:04.302
I'll clean up
better than before.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:08.828
We're leaving.

01:03:09.916 --> 01:03:11.657
What?

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.746
I'm taking you home.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.313
What about
Roger taking me?

01:03:15.356 --> 01:03:17.576
Who the fuck do you
think told me to take you?

01:03:19.143 --> 01:03:20.797
Meet my new brother.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.625
I'm just Grace
and Roger's friend. Hi.

01:03:23.669 --> 01:03:24.888
-Look at this.

01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:26.063
I don't even care.

01:03:26.106 --> 01:03:27.716
He just threw up
on my fucking computer.

01:03:32.156 --> 01:03:34.723
Thank you.
Thank you for taking me.

01:03:35.942 --> 01:03:37.117
Taking him where?

01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:42.819
Aren't you a little old
to be getting adopted?

01:03:44.385 --> 01:03:45.647
I'm not adopted.

01:03:46.518 --> 01:03:47.519
Yeah, you are.

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:50.870
To him.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:53.917
No, thank you.

01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:57.529
Dad told me
you need to smoke it.

01:03:58.486 --> 01:04:00.358
What?

01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:04.014
It's for your healing.
He says you need to relax.

01:04:04.057 --> 01:04:05.842
That's okay, really.
Thank you.

01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:07.278
I already took some pills.

01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:09.236
Um, no.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.325
Actually, it's not,
"Okay, really. Thank you."

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:13.719
Your new dad says
that your pills aren't enough

01:04:13.762 --> 01:04:16.809
and that you need to smoke
this with your little sister.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.680
Please,
I really can't do this.

01:04:18.724 --> 01:04:20.334
I just saw something
very confusing

01:04:20.378 --> 01:04:21.553
and I just need to get home.

01:04:24.469 --> 01:04:27.559
Look, you smoke it
and we take you home.

01:04:27.602 --> 01:04:29.691
You don't and we don't.
That's it.

01:04:32.433 --> 01:04:34.131
Wait...

01:04:34.174 --> 01:04:36.176
Then, I'll just wait
for Roger to take me.

01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:41.834
Can you please open the door?

01:04:43.575 --> 01:04:45.925
If you don't do it right now,

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:47.666
I'm going to make her
pull my hair so hard

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:49.494
that it detaches my scalp,

01:04:49.537 --> 01:04:50.756
and she'll say
that you did it.

01:04:51.322 --> 01:04:52.323
I will.

01:04:53.672 --> 01:04:55.935
I remember that you did,
I saw it.

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:57.328
You taking advantage of us.

01:05:08.034 --> 01:05:09.122
What's in it?

01:05:09.818 --> 01:05:11.081
It's three things.

01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:21.091
Okay, thank you.

01:05:21.134 --> 01:05:22.614
Do it actually.

01:05:22.657 --> 01:05:24.355
Please. That was enough.

01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:43.113
Harder.

01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:48.335
Keep going.

01:05:48.901 --> 01:05:50.076
Don't stop.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.992
-Don't cough. Don't...

01:05:55.734 --> 01:05:56.735
Dude...

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:02.001
Oh, my God...

01:06:02.523 --> 01:06:03.524
Oh, my God!

01:06:04.438 --> 01:06:05.613
Oh, my God!

01:06:05.657 --> 01:06:07.267
I'll take this.

01:06:10.488 --> 01:06:11.619
Wait, what?

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:13.839
What is that? What?

01:06:13.882 --> 01:06:15.319
"What is that?"

01:06:15.362 --> 01:06:16.407
All right,
can you please open...

01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:17.669
Your brother is fucked.

01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:20.541
Can you open
the window, please?

01:06:20.585 --> 01:06:22.630
-Yeah bitch! Hit that!

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:27.679
Oh...

01:06:28.462 --> 01:06:30.421
Oh, my God.

01:06:30.464 --> 01:06:32.466
-Wait, what is in that?

01:06:33.641 --> 01:06:35.121
You saw
what Sarah posted?

01:06:35.165 --> 01:06:37.515
Oh, my God.
What a lying little bitch.

01:06:37.558 --> 01:06:39.169
Bet she never even
met that guy.

01:06:39.212 --> 01:06:40.605
Whatever.
He needs to raise your grade.

01:06:40.648 --> 01:06:43.086
Can you die from this?

01:06:43.129 --> 01:06:44.870
Can you die from this?

01:06:44.913 --> 01:06:47.612
What? I don't know...
Wait, wait.

01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:50.745
I don't want to.

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:52.051
Dude, I'm still
so fucking pissed.

01:06:53.661 --> 01:06:54.706
Yeah, whatever.

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:57.448
This is, like,
the fifth time!

01:06:57.491 --> 01:06:58.797
It is not the fifth!

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.973
-It's, like, the second!
-I don't care!

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:02.801
Not even a D. A D-plus.

01:07:02.844 --> 01:07:04.455
Just give me
a fucking C-minus!

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:08.285
It's 'cause
he wants you.

01:07:08.328 --> 01:07:10.896
He should be fired
for wanting me.

01:07:10.939 --> 01:07:12.724
Oh, my God, he would
totally not survive it.

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:14.291
He's like
a thousand years old.

01:07:15.727 --> 01:07:16.989
Oh, my God,
what if we killed him

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.077
by getting him fired?

01:07:35.529 --> 01:07:37.183
The car is getting smaller.

01:07:42.014 --> 01:07:44.364
Oh, wait,
that's the house again!

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:46.236
We just passed your house!

01:07:46.279 --> 01:07:48.151
-Hey!
- What?

01:07:53.721 --> 01:07:55.593
What?

01:08:14.655 --> 01:08:16.004
Do you miss Martha,
Beau?

01:08:21.053 --> 01:08:23.447
Of course. I love Martha.

01:08:25.275 --> 01:08:26.711
You love Martha?

01:08:28.234 --> 01:08:31.498
She's my friend. I like her.

01:08:38.897 --> 01:08:41.856
Ah, see, Beau?
You're not the only kid here.

01:08:56.610 --> 01:08:57.742
You know
what I've been through.

01:08:57.785 --> 01:08:59.352
So, hearing you
tell me what to do.

01:08:59.396 --> 01:09:01.137
-You can't even pay for it.
-This is my...

01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:06.142
There's
a dead man in the pool!

01:09:08.056 --> 01:09:09.667
There's a dead man
in the pool!

01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:15.238
There's a dead man
in the pool!

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.763
There's a dead man
in the pool!

01:09:21.026 --> 01:09:22.549
There's a dead man
in the pool!

01:09:29.861 --> 01:09:31.602
There's a dead man
in the pool!

01:09:31.645 --> 01:09:33.081
So you're just here
with your mom?

01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:36.911
Only sometimes.
Right now, I'm by myself.

01:09:36.955 --> 01:09:39.087
Mm. I'm Elaine.

01:09:39.131 --> 01:09:40.219
I'm Beau.

01:09:40.263 --> 01:09:41.916
I'm Elaine.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.310
Are you here
with your mother?

01:09:44.354 --> 01:09:45.877
Yeah.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.793
She got me, and my dad got
our rich whore neighbor

01:09:48.836 --> 01:09:50.229
who he's probably
fucking right now

01:09:50.273 --> 01:09:53.319
on a pile
of her slut money in Aruba.

01:09:53.363 --> 01:09:55.930
Here, take a picture of me
and Gene.

01:10:06.027 --> 01:10:08.116
Is that the type of girl
you're attracted to?

01:10:09.727 --> 01:10:10.902
No.

01:10:13.121 --> 01:10:15.820
Because I've noticed
you noticing certain types.

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:20.999
It's okay if you are.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.350
You don't have
to feel embarrassed.

01:10:25.656 --> 01:10:26.787
I'm not.

01:10:34.578 --> 01:10:35.796
She's very pretty.

01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:38.321
Very natural.

01:10:40.671 --> 01:10:42.455
You could ask my advice,
you know?

01:10:44.762 --> 01:10:46.459
Only women know women.

01:10:48.026 --> 01:10:49.157
That's the truth.

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:51.769
Men are blind.

01:10:53.553 --> 01:10:55.686
That's not a criticism.
That's their charm.

01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:58.819
Don't be defensive.

01:11:01.561 --> 01:11:03.259
I'm proud of the man you are.

01:11:05.696 --> 01:11:06.697
Hey...

01:11:11.789 --> 01:11:13.660
I'm proud of the man you are.

01:11:25.019 --> 01:11:26.282
A girl like that...

01:11:27.848 --> 01:11:30.416
confident, self-possessed...

01:11:35.552 --> 01:11:37.423
A man would have to match her.

01:11:41.253 --> 01:11:42.428
But you could.

01:11:44.996 --> 01:11:46.302
She should be so lucky.

01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:51.307
Any woman would be so lucky.

01:11:55.485 --> 01:11:57.835
You just have
to commit completely.

01:12:02.056 --> 01:12:04.668
Nothing in life
is more important

01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:06.496
than choosing
the right companion.

01:12:10.848 --> 01:12:13.894
Hey, my dude!
Long time no see.

01:12:13.938 --> 01:12:15.374
-How was your day?
-How're you feeling,

01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:16.897
-sweetie?
-Oh, good!

01:12:16.941 --> 01:12:18.464
You're already in your PJs.

01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:21.511
Well, we're hot on your tail!

01:12:21.554 --> 01:12:23.251
I think
I might go to bed early.

01:12:24.775 --> 01:12:25.950
Okay.

01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:28.909
I haven't decided yet.

01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:35.829
Unless...
you'd rather I stay up.

01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:40.660
We could
stroll around the deck...

01:12:42.532 --> 01:12:43.794
go star gazing.

01:12:47.928 --> 01:12:49.103
I'll go to bed.

01:12:58.504 --> 01:12:59.636
What about eclairs?

01:13:00.463 --> 01:13:02.116
People hide razors in them.

01:13:03.988 --> 01:13:05.468
What about rainbow cake?

01:13:06.251 --> 01:13:08.079
The colors make cancer.

01:13:09.254 --> 01:13:11.604
What about liquid shit?

01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:16.957
Do you think
your mom's a cunt?

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:19.786
What do you mean?

01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:22.006
Well, it's okay.
My mom's a complete cunt.

01:13:24.095 --> 01:13:25.096
Are you a virgin?

01:13:27.925 --> 01:13:29.143
Well, it doesn't matter!

01:13:29.187 --> 01:13:31.276
I am, too.
I mean, who gives a shit?

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.759
I have to.

01:13:35.802 --> 01:13:38.936
It's very dangerous for me.
It's genetic.

01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:41.504
My father died.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.421
Here...

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.335
-Suck this off.
-What?

01:13:51.731 --> 01:13:52.732
What?

01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:56.432
What?

01:13:59.870 --> 01:14:01.437
We're allowed to kiss.

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:05.049
Who is?

01:14:05.092 --> 01:14:06.354
But only for
the next 10 seconds.

01:14:06.398 --> 01:14:07.486
What do you mean?

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.053
Ten, nine,

01:14:09.096 --> 01:14:10.489
-eight, seven...
-What? Wait...

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:12.143
-...six, five...
-We're allowed to...

01:14:12.186 --> 01:14:13.449
-...four, three...
-Can you just explain?

01:14:13.492 --> 01:14:15.015
-Are we...
-...two, one!

01:14:15.059 --> 01:14:16.800
One and a half!
One and three quarters!

01:14:18.062 --> 01:14:19.106
I'm sorry.

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:21.108
-Elaine!

01:14:22.719 --> 01:14:24.068
Shit, fuck. I gotta go.

01:14:24.111 --> 01:14:26.505
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:14:26.549 --> 01:14:28.246
-Tomorrow?
- Now!

01:14:28.289 --> 01:14:30.640
-...to be in my bed!

01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:35.862
He's breaking your rules!
Hypocrite!

01:14:35.906 --> 01:14:38.169
You want
to test me, young lady?

01:14:44.871 --> 01:14:45.872
Jeeves!

01:14:46.569 --> 01:14:47.831
He's inside!

01:14:49.093 --> 01:14:50.181
Inside!

01:14:52.139 --> 01:14:53.576
Beau, Beau, Beau,

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:55.273
-they're taking me away.

01:14:55.316 --> 01:14:57.362
Beau, wake up, wake up!
She's taking me away.

01:14:57.405 --> 01:14:59.146
-She's taking me off the ship!
-What's happening?

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:00.626
She's taking me away.

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:01.758
-Will you wait for me?
-Beau, what is going on?

01:15:01.801 --> 01:15:03.324
I love you.
Will you wait for me?

01:15:03.368 --> 01:15:04.456
What's happening?

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.371
- I love you.

01:15:06.414 --> 01:15:07.677
Oh, my God.

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.069
Why are you doing this?

01:15:09.113 --> 01:15:10.810
What is this?

01:15:10.854 --> 01:15:12.029
Will you wait for me?

01:15:12.072 --> 01:15:13.291
-Yes.
-Promise?

01:15:13.334 --> 01:15:14.684
-I swear, yes.
-Do you promise? Promise me!

01:15:14.727 --> 01:15:15.859
-Okay? Okay...
-I promise.

01:15:15.902 --> 01:15:17.556
-Enough!
-Who is this bitch?

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.688
ELAINE'S MOM:
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:21.386
-What is this?
- No! No! No!

01:15:21.429 --> 01:15:23.431
-ELAINE'S MOM: Now!
-Beau, I love you, okay?

01:15:23.475 --> 01:15:24.607
ELAINE'S MOM:
Come here right now!

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:25.999
Wait for me!
Wait for me, okay?

01:15:26.043 --> 01:15:27.610
-ELAINE'S MOM: Shut up!
-Oh, my God!

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:29.046
-ELAINE'S MOM: Lainie!
-Wait for me!

01:15:29.089 --> 01:15:30.308
My heart.

01:15:30.351 --> 01:15:31.962
-ELAINE'S MOM: ...never again!
-No!

01:15:32.005 --> 01:15:33.050
-Oh, my God.
-No!

01:15:33.093 --> 01:15:34.181
ELAINE'S MOM: Close it!

01:15:34.225 --> 01:15:35.705
What did you
promise her, Beau?

01:15:37.184 --> 01:15:38.621
Beau!

01:15:38.664 --> 01:15:41.058
Where is she going,
Beau? Was she the one?

01:15:41.101 --> 01:15:42.625
No, no, no, no!
Put that down!

01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:44.235
TONI'S VOICE:
He's on the couch!

01:15:44.278 --> 01:15:45.758
He's inside!

01:15:47.151 --> 01:15:48.718
-Okay, okay, okay...

01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:50.894
-That's him! That's him!
-Okay... Not him. Okay...

01:15:52.373 --> 01:15:53.418
That's enough!

01:15:53.461 --> 01:15:54.985
No need
to get up, Beau!

01:15:55.028 --> 01:15:56.464
-He's not straight!
-Stay bent! Stay bent!

01:15:56.508 --> 01:15:57.509
All right...

01:15:59.424 --> 01:16:01.208
-He's laughing!
-No, no.

01:16:01.252 --> 01:16:02.601
He's laughing!

01:16:02.645 --> 01:16:03.776
He's laughing.

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.386
Don't worry, Beau.
False alarm.

01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:06.649
-It's okay, Beau.

01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:07.954
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

01:16:07.998 --> 01:16:09.739
-It's all under control.

01:16:09.782 --> 01:16:11.088
-Okay.
-He's laughing!

01:16:11.131 --> 01:16:12.785
When they rescued him
in the jungle,

01:16:12.829 --> 01:16:15.614
they found him running around,
shooting at the bodies.

01:16:15.658 --> 01:16:17.355
And not at... not the enemy,

01:16:17.398 --> 01:16:19.662
-his own squad too.
-His own squad, Beau.

01:16:19.705 --> 01:16:22.316
He was defending
himself. He still is.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.232
He's a hero
and he came back to nothing!

01:16:25.276 --> 01:16:27.060
We're the only ones
who would take him in.

01:16:27.104 --> 01:16:29.410
He's gonna be so
ashamed in the morning, Beau.

01:16:29.454 --> 01:16:31.282
Mark my words.

01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:34.285
He loves you.
He told me he loves you.

01:16:34.328 --> 01:16:35.895
He told me yesterday.

01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:41.945
That's not
part of the original contract.

01:16:43.076 --> 01:16:44.948
I'm a mother myself, you know.

01:16:46.036 --> 01:16:47.646
In that case,
I might have to let...

01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:50.301
Look alive, pal!
It's grill time!

01:16:50.344 --> 01:16:52.651
I thought we'd have
a little goodbye barbecue

01:16:52.695 --> 01:16:54.261
before we hit the road!

01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:56.829
- What?
-You got the tri-tip!

01:16:59.266 --> 01:17:01.660
Good morning, sweetheart.
How are you feeling?

01:17:01.704 --> 01:17:02.922
You coming, Gracie?

01:17:02.966 --> 01:17:04.141
Be right there.

01:17:07.057 --> 01:17:08.145
Let's get you up.

01:17:09.146 --> 01:17:10.887
-Oh, oh, oh...

01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:12.845
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Come on.

01:17:14.673 --> 01:17:16.936
Baby. Breathe.

01:17:24.248 --> 01:17:25.684
As someone who sees you
and loves you

01:17:25.728 --> 01:17:27.381
and knows what
you're going through,

01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:29.253
even though I know
I can never know,

01:17:29.296 --> 01:17:30.646
I have to tell you...

01:17:30.689 --> 01:17:31.734
Babers!

01:17:33.866 --> 01:17:37.087
You mind coming out here
for a sec? I need a hand.

01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:38.349
Of course.

01:17:40.177 --> 01:17:42.353
Why don't you find
something to watch?

01:17:43.789 --> 01:17:44.964
I'll be right back.

01:17:46.966 --> 01:17:48.098
Channel 78.

01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:15.272
...now!

01:19:16.447 --> 01:19:18.231
What... What is...

01:19:18.971 --> 01:19:19.972
What...

01:19:21.234 --> 01:19:23.497
What... What...

01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:25.586
We're gonna finally
put some color on these walls.

01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:27.719
-What?

01:19:34.639 --> 01:19:36.293
Here. Take that wall.

01:19:41.515 --> 01:19:42.647
That wall!

01:19:45.215 --> 01:19:46.303
Okay.

01:19:48.044 --> 01:19:49.436
Yeah, how about this?

01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:53.745
Wait... Wait, what...

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:56.052
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.361
Hey... Grace is so careful
about this room.

01:20:01.405 --> 01:20:02.798
It's my brother!

01:20:05.713 --> 01:20:08.586
I know. So, why?

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:13.809
Okay.

01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:15.941
-Yeah.
-What?

01:20:15.985 --> 01:20:17.247
Yeah, you know what?

01:20:18.291 --> 01:20:19.771
You'll just get fucked up
with me.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.164
I'm supposed to be leaving.

01:20:21.207 --> 01:20:22.818
So you'll leave fucked up!

01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:24.776
I feel really, really bad
right now, please!

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.735
So what? You can come into
my life and sleep in my bed

01:20:27.779 --> 01:20:29.433
and steal my fuckin' parents,

01:20:29.476 --> 01:20:31.870
but you can't get
fuckin' fucked up with me?

01:20:31.914 --> 01:20:34.481
No! I'm not trying
to steal anything, I swear!

01:20:34.525 --> 01:20:35.874
I know you are.
You've blown it!

01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:38.094
You failed your stupid test!

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.010
What?

01:20:41.053 --> 01:20:43.055
Everyone pretending
you're some sad old orphan!

01:20:43.099 --> 01:20:44.230
It makes me puke!

01:20:44.274 --> 01:20:46.015
Wait...
Wait, what do you mean?

01:20:46.058 --> 01:20:47.886
Uh, I'm sorry. Please...

01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:49.279
I'll... I'll leave.

01:20:49.322 --> 01:20:50.280
I'll do whatever you want.
But what does that mean?

01:20:50.323 --> 01:20:51.411
What do you mean about a test?

01:20:51.455 --> 01:20:53.022
I'm not asking you to leave!

01:20:53.065 --> 01:20:54.719
I've asked you
to fucking drink

01:20:54.762 --> 01:20:56.242
this fucking paint with me!

01:20:56.286 --> 01:20:58.592
-Toni, please!
-Don't call me Toni!

01:20:58.636 --> 01:21:00.159
I'm sorry,
but it is your name!

01:21:00.203 --> 01:21:02.901
It is my name. It's my name.

01:21:02.945 --> 01:21:04.642
Wait... Wait, what do you mean

01:21:04.685 --> 01:21:05.948
when you said that
about the test?

01:21:05.991 --> 01:21:07.906
-What does that mean?
- I don't care!

01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:08.907
You first.

01:21:10.778 --> 01:21:12.258
Don't, Toni, please.

01:21:12.302 --> 01:21:13.825
You listen to me.

01:21:14.913 --> 01:21:16.610
I have videos of you.

01:21:16.654 --> 01:21:19.091
I'll post them.
I'll say what you did!

01:21:19.135 --> 01:21:22.703
What? What did I do?
What did I do?

01:21:25.489 --> 01:21:27.665
Fine, you fuckin'
pussy faggot.

01:21:27.708 --> 01:21:28.971
No, please, Toni, don't!

01:21:30.146 --> 01:21:32.017
Stop, please!
You're gonna be sick!

01:21:32.539 --> 01:21:33.758
Stop! Stop!

01:21:34.454 --> 01:21:35.499
Fuck you!

01:21:39.459 --> 01:21:42.071
Help! Help! Doctor!

01:21:42.506 --> 01:21:43.507
Help!

01:21:48.816 --> 01:21:49.861
Oh, God!

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:51.689
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:21:52.995 --> 01:21:55.258
She should blink!
She should be blinking.

01:21:55.301 --> 01:21:56.824
No! She drank...

01:21:56.868 --> 01:21:58.087
What did you do to her?

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.873
No! I... I didn't...

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.527
I tried to get her to stop.

01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:06.573
I begged her,
please stop doing it.

01:22:09.141 --> 01:22:11.665
Oh, my God...

01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:13.885
Come on, Toni. Come on, Toni.
No, Toni.

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:16.975
-No! No! Come on, baby.

01:22:17.019 --> 01:22:20.196
I... I didn't... I didn't...
I told her not to.

01:22:20.848 --> 01:22:22.241
I begged her.

01:22:22.285 --> 01:22:23.547
Come on... No!

01:22:24.809 --> 01:22:26.028
Come on, baby! Come on.

01:22:30.597 --> 01:22:32.338
I see you now!

01:22:32.773 --> 01:22:33.818
What?

01:22:34.906 --> 01:22:37.169
Replacing my son!

01:22:37.213 --> 01:22:39.824
-With a demon!
-No, no. No, Grace.

01:22:39.867 --> 01:22:41.521
With a demon!

01:22:44.916 --> 01:22:46.570
-I'll kill you!
-No! No!

01:22:46.613 --> 01:22:48.702
-I'll kill you!
-No! Oh, my God!

01:22:58.321 --> 01:23:01.672
This ends up bad.
It's bad. Totally bad.

01:23:01.715 --> 01:23:03.630
Jeeves!

01:23:04.327 --> 01:23:06.416
Rip him apart!

01:25:49.231 --> 01:25:52.582

01:25:52.625 --> 01:25:56.020

01:26:17.824 --> 01:26:19.783
I'm sorry, I'm... I'm lost.

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:25.136
I was in an accident.
And I don't...

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:27.486
I don't know where I am.

01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:31.969
I'm sorry, but can you
please help me?

01:26:37.453 --> 01:26:38.628
Are you hurt?

01:26:49.378 --> 01:26:52.555
It's a very big piece of glass
in your head.

01:26:52.598 --> 01:26:53.773
Glass?

01:26:54.687 --> 01:26:55.993
Oh, it was a door.

01:26:59.126 --> 01:27:01.216
Oh... I think we should...

01:27:02.391 --> 01:27:03.870
take it out.
Can I take it out?

01:27:03.914 --> 01:27:05.045
Uh-huh.

01:27:07.613 --> 01:27:09.789
- Oh, God...
-Okay. Okay.

01:27:09.833 --> 01:27:11.704
-Oh...
-Okay.

01:27:11.748 --> 01:27:13.140
-Does it bleed a lot?
-Okay, it's out.

01:27:13.184 --> 01:27:15.360
It's good. The head ones,
they bleed like crazy

01:27:15.404 --> 01:27:16.753
and then they just stop.

01:27:17.797 --> 01:27:19.277
Is it?

01:27:19.321 --> 01:27:20.452
-Is it stopped?
-Mm-hmm.

01:27:20.496 --> 01:27:21.888
-It is?
-See?

01:27:22.454 --> 01:27:23.716
Is it?

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.892
Trust me, my father
bled to death.

01:27:28.199 --> 01:27:29.592
We should clean it up.

01:27:29.635 --> 01:27:31.115
It could still get infected.

01:27:32.725 --> 01:27:33.813
You wanna come with me?

01:27:37.469 --> 01:27:38.557
Okay.

01:27:51.875 --> 01:27:52.963
Thank you.

01:27:55.008 --> 01:27:56.183
We're nearly there.

01:28:44.406 --> 01:28:45.363
Hi, Lloyd.

01:28:46.625 --> 01:28:47.800
This is Beau.

01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:50.020
Hello.

01:28:50.063 --> 01:28:52.022
-He was in an accident.

01:28:52.065 --> 01:28:53.240
His mother just died,

01:28:53.284 --> 01:28:55.068
and his father died
before he was born.

01:28:55.808 --> 01:28:57.201
"When sorrows come,

01:28:57.244 --> 01:28:59.551
"they come not single spies,
but in battalions."

01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.249
Thank you.

01:29:02.293 --> 01:29:05.035
-This is me. Just a sec, Beau.

01:29:22.748 --> 01:29:24.750
I have an extra sleeping bag
if you need one.

01:29:25.795 --> 01:29:27.579
This way, Beau.

01:29:27.623 --> 01:29:31.235
"Some Cupid kills
with arrows, some with traps."

01:29:34.804 --> 01:29:38.373
♪ Fly, ladybug, fly

01:29:39.461 --> 01:29:44.030
♪ Up in the sky so high

01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:49.253
♪ I have no parents left

01:29:49.296 --> 01:29:52.169
♪ That's why I'm so bereft

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.304
Damn these crossroads!

01:30:00.569 --> 01:30:02.135
How can one stake one's life

01:30:02.179 --> 01:30:04.311
on a choice between
two unmarked paths?

01:30:06.096 --> 01:30:07.576
-If one leads forward,

01:30:07.619 --> 01:30:10.317
must the other go backwards?

01:30:10.361 --> 01:30:15.018
-If it were a trap?
-Or this an opportunity?

01:30:15.061 --> 01:30:16.889
Or might they
both lead home,

01:30:18.238 --> 01:30:20.763
where I can take
my rightful seat,

01:30:20.806 --> 01:30:22.634
and be lord
of my own possessions?

01:30:26.595 --> 01:30:28.205
They're rehearsing
for the preview.

01:30:28.248 --> 01:30:29.728
Damn these crossroads!

01:30:30.773 --> 01:30:31.948
There, let's not spoil it.

01:30:39.651 --> 01:30:41.305
As great trumpets speak,

01:30:41.348 --> 01:30:44.439
our poor hero
realizes too late.

01:30:44.482 --> 01:30:46.092
But these
are funeral horns!

01:30:46.136 --> 01:30:47.311
Everyone!

01:30:49.008 --> 01:30:50.575
This is Beau.

01:30:50.619 --> 01:30:53.056
Hi, Beau!

01:30:53.099 --> 01:30:54.361
He was in an accident

01:30:54.405 --> 01:30:56.494
and both his parents are dead.

01:30:56.538 --> 01:30:58.757
-No!
-Are you okay?

01:30:58.801 --> 01:30:59.845
That's terrible.

01:31:00.759 --> 01:31:02.457
What is this place?

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.242
We call ourselves
the Orphans of the Forest.

01:31:05.285 --> 01:31:06.983
That's right!

01:31:07.026 --> 01:31:09.159
Although many of our parents
simply abandoned us

01:31:09.202 --> 01:31:10.943
without even bothering to die.

01:31:10.987 --> 01:31:13.163
We're a traveling
theater company.

01:31:13.206 --> 01:31:14.730
We go from forest to forest,

01:31:14.773 --> 01:31:17.428
off the grid, making up homes
from whatever we find.

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:20.692
And then at
the end, we put on a big show!

01:31:27.090 --> 01:31:28.265
I'm so sorry.

01:31:29.353 --> 01:31:30.354
Aw.

01:31:33.444 --> 01:31:34.489
See him?

01:31:37.317 --> 01:31:38.580
That's Yesekov.

01:31:38.623 --> 01:31:40.451
He's the man
who started all of this.

01:31:43.106 --> 01:31:44.237
Papa...

01:31:47.937 --> 01:31:49.808
It's time for the show!

01:31:49.852 --> 01:31:52.115
Hi, there. Are you joining us?

01:31:52.158 --> 01:31:53.595
What do you mean?

01:31:53.638 --> 01:31:54.683
Do you want a costume?

01:31:55.466 --> 01:31:56.989
-Oh...
-We like to, uh,

01:31:57.033 --> 01:31:58.774
blur the line between
the audience and the players.

01:32:00.036 --> 01:32:01.559
Either of these?

01:32:01.603 --> 01:32:02.952
I like this color
with your eyes.

01:32:03.648 --> 01:32:04.736
Or this one's fun...

01:32:05.476 --> 01:32:07.347
Um...

01:32:07.391 --> 01:32:09.524
-That one.
-That's my favorite too.

01:32:09.567 --> 01:32:10.699
Let's get changed.

01:32:12.483 --> 01:32:13.919
I'm happy
you're joining, Beau.

01:32:16.226 --> 01:32:18.358
Hey there, brother,
I'm Duncan!

01:32:18.402 --> 01:32:19.925
What brought you here?

01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:27.585
Jeeves! Rip him apart!

01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:46.735
♪ You can give your life,
you can lose your soul

01:32:46.778 --> 01:32:51.914
♪ You can bang your head
or you can drown in a hole

01:32:51.957 --> 01:32:55.004
♪ Nothing lasts forever, but...

01:32:55.047 --> 01:32:56.222
What am I doing here?

♪ Look around you

♪ Shine

01:33:24.511 --> 01:33:28.907
No!

01:33:35.348 --> 01:33:36.523
O God...

01:33:39.483 --> 01:33:42.921
Fate has burned my house
to cinders

01:33:42.965 --> 01:33:44.967
and launched me into exile.

01:33:48.274 --> 01:33:52.627
I once thought I knew despair,
and that I could master it...

01:33:55.499 --> 01:33:57.632
but now that I know this pain,

01:33:59.155 --> 01:34:00.896
I can't fathom relief.

01:34:03.942 --> 01:34:07.337
When I reach out for answers,

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:11.210
I grasp cold air.

01:34:11.254 --> 01:34:18.043
O, with
my mother and father gone,

01:34:18.087 --> 01:34:21.438
I have lost my whole self!

01:34:57.692 --> 01:34:59.345
You grieve well.

01:35:00.564 --> 01:35:02.914
Your parents are honored,

01:35:02.958 --> 01:35:05.787
and now may rest
forever in peace.

01:35:07.789 --> 01:35:08.833
Rise.

01:35:18.495 --> 01:35:21.150
Now go forth.

01:35:23.413 --> 01:35:26.372
Erect your own
glittering home...

01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:30.986
and make it permanent.

01:35:36.426 --> 01:35:37.862
Do I venture forth...

01:35:42.214 --> 01:35:43.607
or stay here?

01:35:44.956 --> 01:35:46.088
With what I know.

01:36:07.849 --> 01:36:11.026
If I stay, I die.

01:36:14.899 --> 01:36:18.207
No. I must go.

01:36:21.427 --> 01:36:23.255
What? Chains!

01:36:24.735 --> 01:36:25.823
Now you see.

01:36:27.216 --> 01:36:29.435
They have always been there.

01:37:12.565 --> 01:37:16.091
Yes. Push forward.

01:37:16.134 --> 01:37:20.530
Pray that you learn valor
and be given luck.

01:37:22.967 --> 01:37:25.056
You will walk many miles.

01:37:26.579 --> 01:37:28.799
Dozens will become hundreds,

01:37:30.235 --> 01:37:32.368
hundreds
will become thousands.

01:37:34.849 --> 01:37:37.286
You will pass through
countless villages.

01:37:39.941 --> 01:37:43.814
But finally, one village
will speak to you,

01:37:43.858 --> 01:37:46.599
some deep,
essential part of you

01:37:46.643 --> 01:37:48.297
will recognize it,

01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:52.127
and you will say,
"This village is mine."

01:37:59.395 --> 01:38:01.092
You will learn a trade...

01:38:03.442 --> 01:38:05.575
and eventually earn a living.

01:38:08.143 --> 01:38:11.494
You will know the pleasure
of tasting fruit and bread

01:38:11.537 --> 01:38:13.539
-and wine that is yours...

01:38:13.583 --> 01:38:15.193
...because you have earned it.

01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:18.414
You will find a plot of land

01:38:18.457 --> 01:38:21.069
and build a house
with your own hands.

01:38:24.637 --> 01:38:26.465
You will cultivate the land.

01:38:38.869 --> 01:38:40.349
You will live off it.

01:38:43.178 --> 01:38:45.615
You will come
to make new friends.

01:38:49.271 --> 01:38:51.229
One day,
you will meet a woman.

01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:55.233
The story of your meeting
will change

01:38:55.277 --> 01:38:57.453
according to who tells it:

01:38:57.496 --> 01:38:59.020
that you were lost

01:38:59.063 --> 01:39:01.457
and she helped you
find your way,

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.763
or that she was off course

01:39:03.807 --> 01:39:05.374
and you guided her home.

01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:10.640
She will see your fears,

01:39:10.683 --> 01:39:13.686
and your pain, and your dreams,

01:39:13.730 --> 01:39:15.123
and your potential...

01:39:17.995 --> 01:39:19.823
and you will see hers.

01:39:23.218 --> 01:39:25.785
In finding your other half,

01:39:25.829 --> 01:39:28.571
the gifts of your life
will multiply.

01:39:32.096 --> 01:39:35.317
Sometimes, she will look like
a man to you.

01:39:38.537 --> 01:39:42.063
She will become pregnant
because you have sex with her.

01:39:44.935 --> 01:39:47.764
You will have children.
Three sons.

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.724
You will teach them
what you know,

01:39:51.768 --> 01:39:54.249
and you will tell them
you love them every day.

01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:58.557
They will grow
into handsome boys,

01:39:58.601 --> 01:40:03.823
blessed with courage
and kindness and ambition.

01:40:03.867 --> 01:40:07.740
You will share your feelings
of pride with your therapist.

01:40:07.784 --> 01:40:09.481
He will archive them.

01:40:12.223 --> 01:40:14.704
One day, an historic storm

01:40:14.747 --> 01:40:16.532
will sweep through
your village...

01:40:16.575 --> 01:40:18.751
-...and destroy your home.

01:40:23.147 --> 01:40:25.062
-You will be carried away...

01:40:25.106 --> 01:40:26.542
...by a great flood.

01:40:31.764 --> 01:40:34.463
You and your family
will be separated.

01:40:41.557 --> 01:40:45.126
And you will be deposited
in a strange country.

01:40:52.655 --> 01:40:55.223
You will look
for your family for days...

01:40:57.312 --> 01:40:58.487
then weeks,

01:40:59.662 --> 01:41:00.924
then months,

01:41:02.578 --> 01:41:05.189
so many months that
you will come to lose count,

01:41:05.233 --> 01:41:06.930
but you will not find them.

01:41:07.931 --> 01:41:09.628
You will try to find work

01:41:09.672 --> 01:41:12.109
to support
your continuing search,

01:41:12.153 --> 01:41:15.069
but no one
will speak your language.

01:41:15.112 --> 01:41:17.158
You will be treated
like a criminal.

01:41:20.944 --> 01:41:23.990
Eventually,
you will come upon a village

01:41:24.034 --> 01:41:26.297
wracked
by an inexplicable plague.

01:41:27.994 --> 01:41:31.998
As you pass through,
a man, deranged by tragedy,

01:41:32.042 --> 01:41:35.480
will identify you as the beast
who burned down his home

01:41:35.524 --> 01:41:37.308
and replaced
his children's feet

01:41:37.352 --> 01:41:38.527
with their hands.

01:41:40.442 --> 01:41:43.227
You will try to argue
your innocence,

01:41:43.271 --> 01:41:45.664
but this will only
make you sound more guilty.

01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:50.669
You will wonder yourself
whether you are guilty.

01:42:02.855 --> 01:42:04.074
You will flee.

01:42:07.730 --> 01:42:09.558
Mad with vengeance,

01:42:09.601 --> 01:42:12.300
they will send an attack dog
to pursue you.

01:42:14.345 --> 01:42:16.478
It will tear through the world
to find you.

01:42:18.436 --> 01:42:21.526
You won't know this,
but you will sense it.

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.965
And you will keep
a detailed record

01:42:26.009 --> 01:42:28.620
of these impressions in a log.

01:42:28.664 --> 01:42:32.276
And over time, this log
will become many logs.

01:42:34.278 --> 01:42:38.891
Your adventures will continue
for years and years.

01:42:38.935 --> 01:42:42.156
You will learn to distinguish
birds by their call

01:42:42.199 --> 01:42:45.768
and you will know every tree
and plant by its name.

01:42:47.204 --> 01:42:49.380
Abandoning all comforts,

01:42:49.424 --> 01:42:52.731
you will condition your mind
to new ways of seeing.

01:42:54.255 --> 01:42:58.607
You will experience
great highs and profound lows,

01:42:58.650 --> 01:43:00.652
and you will look
for your family

01:43:00.696 --> 01:43:03.960
until your life shrinks
and fades

01:43:04.003 --> 01:43:06.136
into the dream of a ghost.

01:43:10.227 --> 01:43:12.969
You will come to wonder
if they ever existed.

01:43:17.147 --> 01:43:20.411
Finally, when you are
old and frail,

01:43:20.455 --> 01:43:22.370
you will collapse
in exhaustion.

01:43:35.252 --> 01:43:36.601
Oh, sweetheart...

01:43:39.778 --> 01:43:41.215
Why are you crying?

01:43:47.917 --> 01:43:51.225
Because I've searched
for my family

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.575
all my life,

01:43:55.141 --> 01:43:57.013
to the end of my life,

01:43:58.232 --> 01:43:59.972
and I'm still alone.

01:44:02.279 --> 01:44:05.195
You should not be crying
for your misfortunes,

01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:06.849
for your own sins.

01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:10.679
You also have been
searched for,

01:44:10.722 --> 01:44:13.072
but you're so lost
in your own selfishness

01:44:13.116 --> 01:44:14.857
that no one
could ever find you.

01:44:16.685 --> 01:44:17.860
Confess.

01:44:19.078 --> 01:44:20.428
Before your peers.

01:44:21.516 --> 01:44:22.908
But what did I do?

01:44:25.694 --> 01:44:26.782
You know.

01:44:28.174 --> 01:44:29.306
Confess.

01:44:40.317 --> 01:44:42.145
I've been a coward.

01:44:43.146 --> 01:44:44.669
My whole life.

01:44:44.713 --> 01:44:46.802
You will confess everything.

01:44:51.110 --> 01:44:53.069
After which,
you will find the earth

01:44:53.112 --> 01:44:54.897
replaced by good water.

01:44:59.858 --> 01:45:03.166
Sleep will come untroubled.

01:45:07.301 --> 01:45:09.651
To the sound
of distant trumpets,

01:45:09.694 --> 01:45:12.610
you will awake,
as if by a miracle,

01:45:14.438 --> 01:45:17.136
at the foot
of your glittering village.

01:45:26.363 --> 01:45:28.626
No one will recognize you,

01:45:28.670 --> 01:45:32.543
but the smell of the air,
and the sounds of the insects,

01:45:32.587 --> 01:45:34.153
and the way the evening light

01:45:34.197 --> 01:45:36.417
slashes itself
across the chimney

01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:38.506
of a neighbor's old house,

01:45:38.549 --> 01:45:42.074
will unloose in you
a torrent of vivid memories.

01:45:50.213 --> 01:45:53.129
You will be invited
to a special play

01:45:53.172 --> 01:45:55.174
being put on
in an outdoor theater

01:45:55.218 --> 01:45:56.524
just for that night.

01:45:59.265 --> 01:46:00.919
Despite your hunger,

01:46:00.963 --> 01:46:03.835
you will decide to spend
your last dollar on this.

01:46:07.273 --> 01:46:10.538
Over the last 40 years,
his memory had faltered

01:46:10.581 --> 01:46:12.366
to the extent
that he couldn't remember

01:46:12.409 --> 01:46:14.759
his own mother's face,

01:46:14.803 --> 01:46:17.327
but just by breathing
in the air,

01:46:17.371 --> 01:46:19.677
he was seized
by the absolute certainty

01:46:19.721 --> 01:46:22.201
that this was his village.

01:46:23.072 --> 01:46:25.117
Nobody remembered him,

01:46:25.161 --> 01:46:26.728
and even though
all of his neighbors

01:46:26.771 --> 01:46:29.731
had been replaced
by younger generations,

01:46:29.774 --> 01:46:32.081
he recognized everything,

01:46:32.124 --> 01:46:35.780
and somehow
he too felt recognized.

01:46:36.868 --> 01:46:40.089
His home had waited for him,

01:46:40.132 --> 01:46:44.006
just as loyally
as he had searched for it.

01:46:44.049 --> 01:46:45.964
Even the sight
of the evening sun,

01:46:46.008 --> 01:46:50.012
casting slashes of amber light
across a familiar chimney,

01:46:50.055 --> 01:46:53.319
sent him reeling
into a flood of memories.

01:46:56.061 --> 01:46:57.541
What did our father do next?

01:46:57.585 --> 01:46:59.064
And where was the village?

01:46:59.108 --> 01:47:00.805
We only saw it as boys
and have no memories!

01:47:00.849 --> 01:47:01.937
Please,

01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:03.678
-tell us how to find it.
-No, wait...

01:47:03.721 --> 01:47:05.723
What did he do next?

01:47:05.767 --> 01:47:09.161
He was delirious with hunger
and only had enough money

01:47:09.205 --> 01:47:12.295
for one bowl of soup,
but before he could spend it,

01:47:12.338 --> 01:47:15.385
he was invited
to a special play.

01:47:15.429 --> 01:47:16.865
It was already in progress,

01:47:16.908 --> 01:47:19.520
but he felt compelled
to go in,

01:47:19.563 --> 01:47:21.435
so he spent his last dollar.

01:47:22.914 --> 01:47:25.439
Not long after sitting in,

01:47:25.482 --> 01:47:27.745
he saw that
the details of the plot

01:47:27.789 --> 01:47:29.965
were impossibly similar
to those

01:47:30.531 --> 01:47:32.750
of his own life,

01:47:32.794 --> 01:47:35.623
and there were three young men
on the stage

01:47:35.666 --> 01:47:38.495
who looked
remarkably like himself.

01:47:38.539 --> 01:47:39.888
This is me!

01:47:39.931 --> 01:47:43.021
And he rose up, at once
exhilarated and terrified

01:47:43.065 --> 01:47:45.371
that it might not be true,
and he announced...

01:47:45.937 --> 01:47:47.286
This is my story!

01:47:48.810 --> 01:47:51.943
And the three young men
immediately recognized the man

01:47:51.987 --> 01:47:53.336
as their father.

01:47:53.379 --> 01:47:56.208
-Dad?
-No. It can't be.

01:47:56.252 --> 01:47:58.036
My sons!

01:48:02.737 --> 01:48:03.738
Dad...

01:48:04.782 --> 01:48:06.305
Dad... Dad...

01:48:07.089 --> 01:48:08.612
Oh, oh, oh...

01:48:08.656 --> 01:48:10.048
Oh, my God.

01:48:11.093 --> 01:48:12.529
-Oh...
-Oh, my God.

01:48:12.573 --> 01:48:14.705
-Oh...
-Oh, my God.

01:48:14.749 --> 01:48:16.533
You're my boys!

01:48:16.577 --> 01:48:18.970
Oh, my beautiful, sweet boys!

01:48:19.014 --> 01:48:21.538
Don't be afraid. I'm here.
Come here.

01:48:22.408 --> 01:48:25.020
Come here.  Oh...

01:48:25.063 --> 01:48:27.457
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

01:48:27.979 --> 01:48:29.111
Oh...

01:48:30.286 --> 01:48:32.462
Where... Where have you been?

01:48:35.117 --> 01:48:37.946
You... You were ripped
from me.

01:48:37.989 --> 01:48:43.865
I've looked for you
for so long... so long.

01:48:43.908 --> 01:48:47.738
- Oh...

01:48:47.782 --> 01:48:49.000
Where did you go?

01:48:49.044 --> 01:48:50.306
And how are you?

01:48:51.089 --> 01:48:54.963
I made you. Oh, my loves.

01:48:55.006 --> 01:48:58.662
Oh, my loves. Oh, my darlings.

01:48:58.706 --> 01:48:59.750
Oh, my darlings.

01:48:59.794 --> 01:49:01.665
I missed you so much.

01:49:01.709 --> 01:49:05.626
-Oh. Oh, that's okay.

01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:09.238
It's okay, I'm here. I'm here.

01:49:09.978 --> 01:49:11.109
Oh, my loves.

01:49:11.153 --> 01:49:12.502
This the end of things.

01:49:13.764 --> 01:49:14.896
It's okay.

01:49:17.986 --> 01:49:20.336
What about our mother?
Is she...

01:49:21.555 --> 01:49:22.860
-What?
-Is she...

01:49:23.992 --> 01:49:25.167
She's not with you?

01:49:27.604 --> 01:49:28.823
She's not with you?

01:49:28.866 --> 01:49:29.998
-Oh, God.
-We were...

01:49:30.041 --> 01:49:31.826
We were raised as orphans.

01:49:31.869 --> 01:49:33.088
Oh, no!

01:49:34.002 --> 01:49:36.482
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:38.484
Where's Mom?

01:49:38.528 --> 01:49:39.747
It's okay, my love.

01:49:39.790 --> 01:49:41.575
-It's okay.
-Dad...

01:49:43.359 --> 01:49:45.143
Mom...

01:49:45.187 --> 01:49:47.015
-Is there...

01:49:48.538 --> 01:49:51.715
Is there any other family?

01:49:53.674 --> 01:49:54.936
Besides us?

01:49:58.548 --> 01:50:00.028
You had a grandmother.

01:50:01.116 --> 01:50:02.291
Where is she?

01:50:04.119 --> 01:50:05.120
Ah...

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:07.688
Her head.

01:50:09.037 --> 01:50:10.386
And our grandfather?

01:50:14.564 --> 01:50:15.783
How did he die?

01:50:20.570 --> 01:50:22.964
He died
on our wedding night.

01:50:25.183 --> 01:50:27.316
The same night
you were conceived.

01:50:29.231 --> 01:50:33.365
He died the very instant
you were conceived.

01:50:34.845 --> 01:50:35.846
How?

01:50:38.675 --> 01:50:39.807
By finishing.

01:50:41.330 --> 01:50:42.897
Into me.

01:50:45.551 --> 01:50:48.467
He had a heart murmur,
just like you.

01:50:50.556 --> 01:50:51.775
Did it hurt?

01:50:53.734 --> 01:50:56.998
I'm sure it was excruciating.

01:50:58.739 --> 01:51:00.654
It was the first time
we made love.

01:51:02.786 --> 01:51:07.138
The first time either of us
made love, with anyone.

01:51:10.576 --> 01:51:13.623
Your grandpa
and your great-grandpa

01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:15.756
died the same way.

01:51:18.672 --> 01:51:20.412
But he thought
he might be different.

01:51:22.545 --> 01:51:23.764
I'm just as guilty.

01:51:25.853 --> 01:51:27.028
I urged him on.

01:51:29.204 --> 01:51:30.684
I wanted a normal life.

01:51:33.208 --> 01:51:34.688
I wanted a child.

01:51:41.303 --> 01:51:44.349
He died on top of me.

01:51:46.743 --> 01:51:47.918
Inside.

01:51:50.616 --> 01:51:56.361
I think about it,
I want to rip my ears off.

01:51:59.103 --> 01:52:00.278
But then...

01:52:02.803 --> 01:52:05.588
But then, that same trauma...

01:52:07.329 --> 01:52:10.549
which changed me so utterly...

01:52:13.814 --> 01:52:18.732
also resulted in
the greatest gift of my life.

01:52:22.039 --> 01:52:27.436
I am so sorry for what
your daddy passed down to you.

01:52:29.743 --> 01:52:32.354
I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

01:52:38.142 --> 01:52:39.361
Is that a lie?

01:52:41.319 --> 01:52:42.451
No.

01:52:46.934 --> 01:52:48.762
Can...
Can that really happen?

01:52:52.853 --> 01:52:53.941
Yes.

01:52:56.944 --> 01:52:59.207
It's why I never...

01:53:01.992 --> 01:53:03.167
with anyone.

01:53:05.953 --> 01:53:07.041
Dad...

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.087
You've never been with anyone?

01:53:16.354 --> 01:53:21.620
Then...
Then how... did you have us?

01:53:36.331 --> 01:53:37.332
Ah...

01:53:40.596 --> 01:53:42.293
What should I do?

01:53:42.337 --> 01:53:44.078
Which limb shall I strike off?

01:53:44.121 --> 01:53:48.169
You might act yesterday
and it would be decades tardy.

01:53:48.212 --> 01:53:50.127
Have I not given
all I have?

01:53:50.171 --> 01:53:51.868
All you have?

01:53:51.912 --> 01:53:53.914
You have given trifles.

01:53:53.957 --> 01:53:56.742
You have sacrificed
nothing real.

01:53:56.786 --> 01:53:59.354
I have been pinned down
by my promises!

01:54:00.485 --> 01:54:02.226
I am not
the master of my life!

01:54:03.837 --> 01:54:05.055
Are you okay?

01:54:06.622 --> 01:54:09.016
-I am a mouse in a maze!
-A maze?

01:54:09.581 --> 01:54:11.061
I... I feel sick.

01:54:12.497 --> 01:54:13.585
I know.

01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:20.201
Try this.

01:54:21.593 --> 01:54:22.725
It helps me.

01:54:40.874 --> 01:54:41.875
Thank you.

01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:43.311
Thank you.

01:55:35.798 --> 01:55:36.799
Hello?

01:55:38.757 --> 01:55:39.933
Can I help you?

01:55:41.499 --> 01:55:42.805
Do you recognize me?

01:55:46.678 --> 01:55:47.810
I don't know.

01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:50.595
When you were little...

01:55:51.727 --> 01:55:52.728
What?

01:55:54.077 --> 01:55:55.513
How did you come here?

01:55:58.299 --> 01:55:59.691
I was chased.

01:56:08.483 --> 01:56:10.311
Your father is alive.

01:56:11.051 --> 01:56:12.095
What?

01:56:12.139 --> 01:56:14.924
I knew him.
After you were born.

01:56:16.099 --> 01:56:18.536
I worked for your mom.

01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:21.235
Not before I was born.
He died before...

01:56:21.278 --> 01:56:25.891
Serving your dad food,
cleaning up after him.

01:56:29.069 --> 01:56:32.115
My parents were in debt
to your mom.

01:56:33.595 --> 01:56:34.813
What's that?

01:56:36.293 --> 01:56:37.381
What?

01:56:39.427 --> 01:56:41.255
Who... Who are you?

01:56:41.298 --> 01:56:42.691
It doesn't matter, right?

01:56:42.734 --> 01:56:45.737
-It does. It...
-No. It's just...

01:56:45.781 --> 01:56:47.478
kidding. I...

01:56:52.614 --> 01:56:54.268
I'm so happy to see you.

01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:00.230
Are you him?

01:57:00.926 --> 01:57:01.927
Wait.

01:57:03.842 --> 01:57:04.887
Wait.

01:57:04.930 --> 01:57:06.280
You okay, sweetheart?

01:57:09.848 --> 01:57:11.633
Do my eyes deceive me?

01:57:11.676 --> 01:57:13.635
What is this phantom I see?

01:57:17.117 --> 01:57:18.640
Hello, fair stranger!

01:57:23.123 --> 01:57:26.300
Ah, now you see,

01:57:26.343 --> 01:57:28.041
-out of the shadows...

01:57:33.089 --> 01:57:36.092
Get me down right now!
Get me down from here!

01:57:41.967 --> 01:57:44.057
Get me down!
Somebody help me!

01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:46.450
Get me down from here!
Get me down!

01:57:46.494 --> 01:57:48.713
I can't!
I'm tied up. Hurry!

01:57:50.541 --> 01:57:51.673
Beau!

01:57:53.022 --> 01:57:54.589
-Dad?
-Run!

01:59:11.709 --> 01:59:12.971
Am I hurting you?

01:59:21.197 --> 01:59:23.068
Okay, let's go. Clothes off.

01:59:25.897 --> 01:59:28.944
Come on. Enough now.

01:59:30.337 --> 01:59:31.903
What did I say?

01:59:31.947 --> 01:59:33.601
Didn't I say I wasn't gonna do
this again with you tonight?

01:59:36.821 --> 01:59:38.736
I'm about to feel hurt.

01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:39.998
You're about
to really hurt me.

01:59:41.826 --> 01:59:43.045
Where's Daddy?

01:59:45.917 --> 01:59:47.005
Excuse me?

01:59:51.401 --> 01:59:52.707
You know where Daddy is.

01:59:54.143 --> 01:59:55.231
Daddy's dead.

01:59:58.365 --> 01:59:59.757
Are you trying to hurt me?

02:00:00.671 --> 02:00:02.499
I don't care! I want Daddy!

02:00:06.764 --> 02:00:07.983
You want Daddy, too?

02:00:10.681 --> 02:00:13.249
Come on. You want it your way,
let's go!

02:00:25.566 --> 02:00:26.958
Up you go!

02:00:27.002 --> 02:00:29.439
-I can't.
-Oh, but of course you can!

02:00:29.483 --> 02:00:30.875
You're big enough
to hurt Mommy,

02:00:30.919 --> 02:00:32.268
you're big enough for this!

02:00:33.661 --> 02:00:35.489
-Nobody's allowed up there.
-Up!

02:00:38.013 --> 02:00:40.058
-Do you wanna go up, too?
-No.

02:00:40.885 --> 02:00:43.366
What is that? Are you nodding?

02:00:47.457 --> 02:00:48.632
This is it!

02:00:50.852 --> 02:00:52.810
We don't talk
about you anymore!

02:00:54.072 --> 02:00:56.336
-Get back in!

02:03:13.647 --> 02:03:15.518
Excuse me, sir.

02:03:15.562 --> 02:03:18.652
Is the funeral
already happening?

02:03:18.695 --> 02:03:21.263
Already over.
There's a video inside.

02:04:05.829 --> 02:04:07.135
[ON SPEAKERS]  Mona.

02:04:09.050 --> 02:04:10.268
Mona Wassermann.

02:04:12.575 --> 02:04:15.273
We're gathered here today
as a community,

02:04:15.317 --> 02:04:18.538
bound together
by our love for Mona,

02:04:18.581 --> 02:04:20.061
and by a feeling of duty.

02:04:22.150 --> 02:04:24.979
The duty to mourn
Mona's passing,

02:04:25.022 --> 02:04:27.808
but also to celebrate
Mona's life.

02:04:30.375 --> 02:04:33.857
Mona, who was
petrified of squirrels.

02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:39.820
Mona, who single-handedly
built a super-business

02:04:39.863 --> 02:04:42.170
beyond her wildest dreams.

02:04:44.607 --> 02:04:48.393
Mona, who was
an endlessly dedicated wife

02:04:48.437 --> 02:04:50.570
to her adoring husband,

02:04:50.613 --> 02:04:52.093
who passed away tragically

02:04:52.136 --> 02:04:54.269
just as their life together
was blossoming.

02:04:56.097 --> 02:04:59.230
And Mona,
who was a devoted mother

02:04:59.274 --> 02:05:02.407
to her sole surviving son,
Beau,

02:05:02.451 --> 02:05:04.627
whom she loved so deeply,

02:05:04.671 --> 02:05:09.589
and who has elected not to
be present with us today.

02:05:09.632 --> 02:05:14.245
Mona loved Beau with a love
that could move mountains.

02:05:14.289 --> 02:05:15.986
In fact, I suggest
when we leave,

02:05:16.030 --> 02:05:18.467
we check on the mountains
to make sure they're okay.

02:05:55.635 --> 02:05:56.984
What can you say?

02:05:57.985 --> 02:05:59.682
I hope she knows that.

02:06:01.379 --> 02:06:02.946
I wish I could tell her that.

02:06:03.904 --> 02:06:06.297
That I... I did, I loved her.

02:06:06.341 --> 02:06:08.996
And it's in accordance
with her last wishes

02:06:09.039 --> 02:06:10.693
that we now play this song.

02:06:11.346 --> 02:06:13.391
Her favorite song.

02:06:20.921 --> 02:06:24.359

02:09:54.264 --> 02:09:55.439
Hello!

02:10:00.618 --> 02:10:01.750
Yoo-hoo!

02:10:10.672 --> 02:10:12.152
Hello?

02:10:21.639 --> 02:10:23.206
Hello?

02:10:32.128 --> 02:10:33.129
Hi.

02:10:34.783 --> 02:10:36.263
Uh, I'm sorry.

02:10:38.221 --> 02:10:40.658
I thought it started at 8 p.m.

02:10:49.885 --> 02:10:52.279
Okay, um, I brought flowers.

02:10:52.322 --> 02:10:54.020
I'll just leave them here,
I guess.

02:10:58.024 --> 02:10:59.416
She also owes me money.

02:11:00.591 --> 02:11:02.202
This certainly isn't the time,

02:11:02.245 --> 02:11:04.160
and you're probably
not the person...

02:11:12.952 --> 02:11:14.649
Okay, um...

02:11:18.783 --> 02:11:21.917
I'll be leaving, then. I just
need to call another Uber.

02:11:21.961 --> 02:11:24.311
-I can wait for it...

02:11:24.877 --> 02:11:25.921
I'm sorry again.

02:12:08.833 --> 02:12:10.531
Elaine?

02:12:15.101 --> 02:12:16.189
It's me.

02:12:22.369 --> 02:12:23.718
It's Beau.

02:12:31.944 --> 02:12:33.946
Oh, my God.

02:12:36.339 --> 02:12:37.514
Beau?

02:12:39.690 --> 02:12:40.909
No.

02:12:40.953 --> 02:12:42.955
Uh, it can't be.

02:12:44.434 --> 02:12:46.349
I can't believe it's you.

02:12:48.743 --> 02:12:50.484
Oh, my God!

02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:55.228
I mean, of course it's you.
This is your mom.

02:12:57.839 --> 02:12:59.014
I'm so sorry.

02:13:00.102 --> 02:13:01.321
For your loss.

02:13:03.192 --> 02:13:04.454
What are you doing here?

02:13:09.068 --> 02:13:12.897
I'm just trying to, you know,
uh, pay my respects. And...

02:13:14.203 --> 02:13:15.900
I guess to give you
my condolences.

02:13:15.944 --> 02:13:18.033
Since you're actually here.
I'm...

02:13:19.513 --> 02:13:20.731
so sorry.

02:13:26.302 --> 02:13:28.174
I can't believe it's you.

02:13:31.873 --> 02:13:33.266
I can't believe it's you.

02:13:36.138 --> 02:13:37.400
Do I look different?

02:13:38.793 --> 02:13:40.012
You recognized me.

02:13:40.751 --> 02:13:41.839
I'm old now.

02:13:43.624 --> 02:13:44.755
You're the same.

02:13:47.106 --> 02:13:48.194
No, I'm not.

02:13:49.238 --> 02:13:50.326
You are.

02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:52.807
Well, you're the same, too.

02:13:52.850 --> 02:13:54.591
Except for your body
and your face.

02:14:01.642 --> 02:14:02.947
You worked for her?

02:14:07.126 --> 02:14:08.257
What do you mean?

02:14:10.607 --> 02:14:12.261
Well, I did until last week.

02:14:16.787 --> 02:14:19.703
I was actually just drowning
my sorrows before I came.

02:14:19.747 --> 02:14:21.444
My breath's like pure wine.

02:14:24.708 --> 02:14:26.014
"Until last week"?

02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:34.066
I'm sorry for your loss.

02:14:42.596 --> 02:14:43.814
I waited for you.

02:14:50.865 --> 02:14:52.040
What do you mean?

02:14:55.565 --> 02:14:56.610
Why?

02:15:00.788 --> 02:15:01.919
You told me to.

02:15:04.748 --> 02:15:06.185
I even have it in writing.

02:15:12.408 --> 02:15:13.670
I wanted you to.

02:15:25.334 --> 02:15:28.337
Baby, baby, baby...

02:15:38.782 --> 02:15:40.262
Do you want to go inside?

02:15:44.571 --> 02:15:46.007
Do you want me to leave?

02:16:10.814 --> 02:16:11.946
Let's go inside.

02:16:19.997 --> 02:16:21.434
Bedroom, where?

02:16:27.614 --> 02:16:28.919
The dragon's lair!

02:16:41.889 --> 02:16:43.499
Got any candles...?

02:16:54.902 --> 02:16:56.512
Why don't you go
to the bathroom?

02:16:56.556 --> 02:16:58.079
When you come back,
I'll be ready.

02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:29.893
-You didn't get undressed.
-Yup.

02:17:40.643 --> 02:17:43.255
Hi. Hi, sorry. Hi.

02:17:46.345 --> 02:17:47.650
Huh. Mm.

02:17:53.743 --> 02:17:55.745
-You okay?
-Yeah.

02:17:57.791 --> 02:17:59.227
Are y... Are you?

02:17:59.271 --> 02:18:00.620
You're so tense.

02:18:00.663 --> 02:18:02.970
-Oh... I'm sorry.
-Relax.

02:18:03.013 --> 02:18:05.886
Okay. It's just because,
you know,

02:18:05.929 --> 02:18:08.454
it's been, like,
kind of awhile.

02:18:09.803 --> 02:18:11.718
Yeah, me too.

02:18:20.292 --> 02:18:22.076
I like that
you're not all macho.

02:18:23.033 --> 02:18:24.121
Thank you.

02:18:25.906 --> 02:18:27.690
Take these off.

02:18:27.734 --> 02:18:29.779
Okay, what I meant was that

02:18:29.823 --> 02:18:32.347
it's been
really kind of a while.

02:18:32.391 --> 02:18:34.349
Well, it hasn't affected
your virility.

02:18:34.393 --> 02:18:36.569
-What?
-You're crazy hard.

02:18:36.612 --> 02:18:37.700
Really?

02:18:48.189 --> 02:18:49.886
-Oh...

02:18:50.887 --> 02:18:51.975
Oh, my God.

02:18:53.803 --> 02:18:55.544
-Is it... Is it on?
-Yeah.

02:18:55.588 --> 02:18:57.677
You sure the condom
is on all the way?

02:18:58.765 --> 02:18:59.766
Yeah?

02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:02.464
Oh, my God.

02:19:02.508 --> 02:19:05.075
-Are you really in?
- You feel so good.

02:19:05.119 --> 02:19:06.338
Oh, no.

02:19:06.381 --> 02:19:08.601
Oh, no!

02:19:10.864 --> 02:19:11.865
Wait...

02:19:13.432 --> 02:19:15.738
-Isn't it nice?
-Yeah...

02:19:15.782 --> 02:19:17.653
But wait.

02:19:17.697 --> 02:19:19.089
-I...
-Let's start it over.

02:19:19.133 --> 02:19:20.221
What?

02:19:30.405 --> 02:19:31.885
-Isn't it nice?
-Yeah.

02:19:31.928 --> 02:19:33.626
Wait a second.

02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:35.410
I... I... I can't...

02:19:35.454 --> 02:19:37.281
-I think it's gonna happen.

02:19:37.325 --> 02:19:39.109
Wait! You gotta wait a second.

02:19:39.153 --> 02:19:41.895
-Stop! Oh, stop! Stop!

02:19:41.938 --> 02:19:44.332
Stop! Ahh! Oh! Oh, no!

02:19:56.170 --> 02:19:58.564
Oh, my! My God.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.001
God.

02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:04.221
Oh...

02:20:05.788 --> 02:20:07.964
I really felt that.

02:20:08.008 --> 02:20:10.750
-Oh, God, that was a lot.

02:20:10.793 --> 02:20:12.404
You just blasted
through that bag.

02:20:14.275 --> 02:20:16.190
-Oh, my God.

02:20:16.233 --> 02:20:17.409
Oh, yeah.

02:20:24.590 --> 02:20:26.243
I want to come too.

02:20:26.287 --> 02:20:28.028
-I...
-Hold on.

02:20:28.071 --> 02:20:30.465
Hold on. Hold on.

02:20:30.509 --> 02:20:32.075
-Uh...
-Don't move.

02:20:32.119 --> 02:20:33.773
-Don't move.

02:20:33.816 --> 02:20:36.819
-Don't move. Okay?

02:20:58.319 --> 02:21:00.582
Oh, my God!

02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:09.939
Oh, my gosh.

02:21:11.811 --> 02:21:13.595
Oh, my God.

02:21:16.250 --> 02:21:18.470
I really thought
I was going to die.

02:21:21.168 --> 02:21:23.300
My whole life.

02:21:26.826 --> 02:21:28.088
Oh, thank you.

02:21:28.915 --> 02:21:31.308
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

02:21:31.961 --> 02:21:33.223
Thank you.

02:23:05.402 --> 02:23:07.796
No, please.
Continue as if I wasn't here.

02:23:12.975 --> 02:23:14.411
What would be next?

02:23:19.025 --> 02:23:20.113
No?

02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:26.772
You don't look especially
overjoyed to see me, honey.

02:23:28.469 --> 02:23:31.124
I was dead just a minute ago.
This is a miracle.

02:24:27.441 --> 02:24:29.138
Get rid of this. Feed Harry.

02:25:29.068 --> 02:25:30.243
She worked for you?

02:25:33.855 --> 02:25:36.336
I sincerely doubt that,
sweetheart,

02:25:36.379 --> 02:25:39.295
but if you're right, you can
let her know she's fired.

02:25:51.525 --> 02:25:52.700
For how long?

02:25:54.441 --> 02:25:58.010
How many years from...
from the beginning? From...

02:25:58.053 --> 02:25:59.751
How is your head feeling?

02:26:01.404 --> 02:26:03.537
It looks like you really
banged up your face.

02:26:04.886 --> 02:26:06.496
You could have a concussion.

02:26:08.672 --> 02:26:10.065
You don't feel disoriented?

02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:13.199
You know where you are?

02:26:17.551 --> 02:26:19.031
I'm in my house.

02:26:19.074 --> 02:26:22.338
Actually, you're in my house,
sweetheart.

02:26:22.382 --> 02:26:25.951
And my house is your house,
which it always will be.

02:26:27.996 --> 02:26:30.782
But if you know where you are,

02:26:30.825 --> 02:26:32.958
then you must also know
where you just were.

02:26:33.001 --> 02:26:35.003
And where you just did
what you just did,

02:26:35.047 --> 02:26:37.136
which I saw every second of.

02:26:39.138 --> 02:26:41.662
You didn't just wake up
suddenly and you were there.

02:26:43.229 --> 02:26:44.796
You didn't just
get dropped in,

02:26:44.839 --> 02:26:46.449
out of the blue,
to your surprise,

02:26:46.493 --> 02:26:48.147
your deceased mother's room,

02:26:48.190 --> 02:26:50.192
only days after
what you believed

02:26:50.236 --> 02:26:51.411
-was her death!
-I didn't.

02:26:51.454 --> 02:26:52.847
You didn't just
get deposited there

02:26:52.891 --> 02:26:54.327
-by accident!
-I didn't mean it.

02:26:54.370 --> 02:26:56.285
-Yes, I know you didn't.
-No. I knew you weren't dead.

02:27:04.206 --> 02:27:06.295
I saw with my own eyes

02:27:06.339 --> 02:27:09.472
exactly what you knew
and what you didn't know.

02:27:09.516 --> 02:27:11.213
You saw my body.

02:27:15.478 --> 02:27:17.089
I saw the birthmark, Mom.

02:27:19.918 --> 02:27:22.050
I know those were
Martha's hands.

02:27:28.143 --> 02:27:29.318
That's right.

02:27:33.845 --> 02:27:36.064
-Goodnight, baby.
-Goodnight, Martha.

02:27:36.108 --> 02:27:39.154
And if I hear any noise,
I'll break back in

02:27:39.198 --> 02:27:41.461
-and I'll tickle you to death!

02:27:44.986 --> 02:27:46.118
It's...

02:27:47.902 --> 02:27:48.990
What...

02:27:49.469 --> 02:27:50.600
How...

02:27:51.601 --> 02:27:52.776
How you even...

02:27:54.169 --> 02:27:55.692
Ki... H...

02:27:55.736 --> 02:27:57.999
How can you do that to her?

02:27:58.043 --> 02:27:59.435
"Do that to her"?

02:28:00.697 --> 02:28:02.264
Baby, I would never
do anything

02:28:02.308 --> 02:28:03.918
to the loyal
and devoted housekeeper

02:28:03.962 --> 02:28:06.834
who gave me 37 years
of unconditional service.

02:28:08.140 --> 02:28:09.315
She volunteered.

02:28:13.623 --> 02:28:14.886
-No, she didn't.
-Yes.

02:28:14.929 --> 02:28:16.104
-No, she didn't!
-She did.

02:28:16.148 --> 02:28:17.366
No, she didn't!

02:28:17.410 --> 02:28:20.587
I couldn't restrain her
from volunteering.

02:28:28.943 --> 02:28:30.075
For how much?

02:28:38.561 --> 02:28:42.957
Enough that every member
of her extended family

02:28:43.001 --> 02:28:45.046
quit their job
on the same day,

02:28:46.134 --> 02:28:48.310
and won't ever need
to work again.

02:28:49.921 --> 02:28:51.313
And you know something else?

02:28:52.271 --> 02:28:53.707
It was worth every penny.

02:28:59.278 --> 02:29:00.844
Because now I know.

02:29:03.543 --> 02:29:05.458
-What do you know?
-Everything.

02:29:09.375 --> 02:29:11.507
You don't know anything.

02:29:11.551 --> 02:29:12.944
Oh, do you think so, Beau?

02:29:14.597 --> 02:29:16.077
Do you really think so?

02:29:17.992 --> 02:29:19.820
Do you also think
I didn't know

02:29:19.863 --> 02:29:22.214
when you called
to give me the big bad news

02:29:22.257 --> 02:29:23.867
about your fictitious keys

02:29:23.911 --> 02:29:26.783
being stolen
from your imaginary door?

02:29:26.827 --> 02:29:29.003
-My key... they were stolen.
-You think a mother

02:29:29.047 --> 02:29:32.311
can even help but see through
her son's blatant lies

02:29:32.354 --> 02:29:35.488
and falsehoods
and endless schemes?

02:29:35.531 --> 02:29:37.403
You think
this is any different

02:29:37.446 --> 02:29:39.840
from the time you gave me the
exact same CD for my birthday

02:29:39.883 --> 02:29:41.537
that you gave me
the year before

02:29:41.581 --> 02:29:44.671
and which you also gave your
fucking high-school counselor?

02:29:46.020 --> 02:29:48.066
Or when you bought me
that kitchen set

02:29:48.109 --> 02:29:52.244
the very week after
I publicly swore off cooking!

02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:55.116
Even when you were a baby,

02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:58.859
you rejected me
and refused to breastfeed,

02:29:58.902 --> 02:30:01.427
while every other smug cunt
on the street

02:30:01.470 --> 02:30:04.604
had happy, docile babies
sucking their tits dry!

02:30:05.866 --> 02:30:07.433
Do you think
I hear the absurd story

02:30:07.476 --> 02:30:10.827
of you missing your flight and
that I don't absolutely know,

02:30:10.871 --> 02:30:12.699
that I have any hint
of a doubt,

02:30:12.742 --> 02:30:14.440
that you never,
from the very start,

02:30:14.483 --> 02:30:17.008
intended to make that flight?

02:30:17.051 --> 02:30:19.575
The true surprise, the shock,

02:30:19.619 --> 02:30:21.403
would have been
you actually coming!

02:30:21.447 --> 02:30:23.231
Now, that would
have spun my head like a top!

02:30:23.275 --> 02:30:24.537
I wouldn't have known
what to do!

02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:26.582
I'd have thrown myself
flopping on the floor,

02:30:26.626 --> 02:30:29.150
begging God's forgiveness
for ever having doubted you,

02:30:29.194 --> 02:30:33.111
but still I would have been
struck stupid with disbelief!

02:30:37.854 --> 02:30:39.334
What, you walking away?

02:30:44.513 --> 02:30:45.732
Where you going?

02:30:50.824 --> 02:30:52.391
What's behind the door, Beau?

02:30:56.351 --> 02:30:58.527
Where on earth
are you gonna go?

02:31:03.271 --> 02:31:07.884
You've always acted like some
dutiful, doting little boy,

02:31:07.928 --> 02:31:10.539
as if it's throwing me
off some scent.

02:31:11.627 --> 02:31:14.021
None of it's ever been real.

02:31:14.065 --> 02:31:16.806
You spent your whole life
going around,

02:31:16.850 --> 02:31:19.331
asking every half-wit
you could find,

02:31:19.374 --> 02:31:21.115
"If I do this,
can I avoid this,

02:31:21.159 --> 02:31:22.551
"or will that happen?"

02:31:22.595 --> 02:31:26.164
As if you were born without
the mechanism to choose.

02:31:26.207 --> 02:31:28.862
You let it all resolve itself
in the absence of you!

02:31:28.905 --> 02:31:30.472
You make everyone
do it for you!

02:31:30.516 --> 02:31:32.431
You think
that makes you innocent?

02:31:36.522 --> 02:31:39.264
My own mother
wouldn't even touch me.

02:31:40.743 --> 02:31:43.355
Not if it was simply to
stamp me out if I was on fire!

02:31:45.052 --> 02:31:47.010
I wasn't worthy of her love.

02:31:47.054 --> 02:31:49.361
I hadn't earned it!
And I never earned it.

02:31:49.404 --> 02:31:50.753
No matter what I did,

02:31:50.797 --> 02:31:54.061
no matter how much
of my deepest real self

02:31:54.105 --> 02:31:56.803
I denied and buried,

02:31:56.846 --> 02:31:59.022
and smothered
until it was dead.

02:31:59.066 --> 02:32:00.285
None of it mattered.

02:32:01.808 --> 02:32:04.115
She blamed me for everything
her mother did to her.

02:32:06.552 --> 02:32:08.031
When I had you,

02:32:08.075 --> 02:32:09.859
I promised,
"I will never do that to him.

02:32:11.731 --> 02:32:13.907
"I will give him
all the love I have."

02:32:16.649 --> 02:32:18.564
You know what I tell people

02:32:18.607 --> 02:32:20.392
when they ask me
how my son is doing?

02:32:22.307 --> 02:32:23.960
I say, "Your guess
is as good as mine."

02:32:29.227 --> 02:32:30.880
How I wish that were true.

02:32:33.970 --> 02:32:35.755
[ON SPEAKERS]  Tell
me more about that period.

02:32:40.455 --> 02:32:41.587
Well...

02:32:43.154 --> 02:32:46.200
When I was just starting
to like my own stuff

02:32:46.244 --> 02:32:48.115
and do my own things,

02:32:48.159 --> 02:32:50.552
she'd take all those changes
very personally,

02:32:50.596 --> 02:32:53.425
and get very mad or sad

02:32:53.468 --> 02:32:56.254
and make me feel bad
about it until I stopped.

02:33:00.171 --> 02:33:02.695
So, through
the weaning process,

02:33:02.738 --> 02:33:05.088
she took your displays
of autonomy

02:33:05.132 --> 02:33:06.481
as a betrayal.

02:33:07.656 --> 02:33:08.788
Exactly.

02:33:11.530 --> 02:33:12.661
What do you mean?

02:33:15.098 --> 02:33:17.318
Can you
give me an example?

02:33:17.362 --> 02:33:19.712
Well, like, she would
give me lots of love...

02:33:19.755 --> 02:33:22.236
Oh, I gave you lots of love!
I'm sorry!

02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:24.020
...b  ut if I didn't
give it back to her

02:33:24.064 --> 02:33:25.413
in the exact same way,

02:33:25.457 --> 02:33:27.241
she saw it as
me being not thankful

02:33:27.285 --> 02:33:30.723
and, like, trying to hurt her.

02:33:30.766 --> 02:33:32.725
So the love
was conditional?

02:33:33.247 --> 02:33:34.814
Yes.

02:33:34.857 --> 02:33:37.469
Ah. This is
very good for you, Beau.

02:33:38.557 --> 02:33:39.993
Over 300 sessions,

02:33:40.036 --> 02:33:42.822
and that was about as
flattering to me as they get.

02:33:42.865 --> 02:33:45.259
Which one was my favorite,
Jeremy?

02:33:45.303 --> 02:33:47.566
October 3, 2018.

02:33:47.609 --> 02:33:49.350
How could you do...

02:33:49.872 --> 02:33:51.091
How could you...

02:33:52.571 --> 02:33:54.225
How could you do this to me?

02:33:56.879 --> 02:33:59.839
[ON SPEAKERS]  I've been
having it since I was little.

02:34:00.753 --> 02:34:02.842
Where I'm a little boy,

02:34:02.885 --> 02:34:06.802
probably the same age as  when
I started having the dream...

02:34:06.846 --> 02:34:09.718
and there's another me,
who's identical,

02:34:11.067 --> 02:34:13.461
but he's braver,

02:34:13.505 --> 02:34:15.942
and he asks her
about my father

02:34:15.985 --> 02:34:18.161
because I'm too scared.

02:34:18.205 --> 02:34:24.037
And then she sends him away
and locks him up. Upstairs.

02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:25.821
And she never
talks about him again.

02:34:28.171 --> 02:34:30.913
What is it you want
to know about your father?

02:34:30.957 --> 02:34:33.916
If you weren't afraid, if
there were no consequences...

02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:35.527
-I want to know the truth.
- ...what would you

02:34:35.570 --> 02:34:36.615
ask your mom?

02:34:37.703 --> 02:34:38.878
I'd ask her...

02:34:40.532 --> 02:34:43.056
-To tell me the truth!
- I don't know...

02:34:43.099 --> 02:34:45.711
Do you feel
she didn't tell you the truth?

02:34:45.754 --> 02:34:46.842
-Yes!
- Um...

02:34:47.582 --> 02:34:49.323
-I don't know.
-Yes!

02:34:49.367 --> 02:34:50.759
-'Cause I...
- But I think

02:34:50.803 --> 02:34:51.847
-  I'm too afraid to believe it.
-I know now.

02:34:51.891 --> 02:34:53.327
I know the truth. I...

02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:58.593
I met my father. I met the man
in the woods, and I know.

02:34:58.637 --> 02:35:00.291
Why did you lie to me?

02:35:02.554 --> 02:35:04.295
Do you want the truth now?

02:35:04.338 --> 02:35:05.339
Yes!

02:35:14.130 --> 02:35:15.306
Follow me.

02:35:37.371 --> 02:35:39.199
-Up there?
-That's right.

02:35:40.896 --> 02:35:42.158
Nobody's allowed
up there.

02:35:43.943 --> 02:35:45.901
Some things are
for your protection, Beau,

02:35:45.945 --> 02:35:48.164
and I want you to remember
that I kept this from you!

02:35:52.081 --> 02:35:53.213
I don't wanna
go up there now.

02:35:53.256 --> 02:35:54.606
-I don't wanna...
-No,

02:35:54.649 --> 02:35:56.782
you want the truth,
and I think you deserve it.

02:35:58.958 --> 02:36:00.829
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I'll be right behind you.

02:36:00.873 --> 02:36:02.265
No. I don't wanna
go up there, Mom.

02:36:02.309 --> 02:36:04.355
I'll be right behind you.
Don't worry.

02:36:05.356 --> 02:36:07.096
Up you go.

02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:09.272
Don't worry,
I'll be right behind you.

02:36:09.316 --> 02:36:11.492
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Up you go.

02:36:13.189 --> 02:36:15.496
-This is just like my dream.
-I'm right behind you.

02:36:16.932 --> 02:36:19.500
-I'm right behind you.
-Oh... Oh, God.

02:36:20.022 --> 02:36:21.067
Oh...

02:36:22.982 --> 02:36:25.593
Oh, this is exactly
like my dream!

02:36:25.637 --> 02:36:27.421
Don't you get it,
you stupid idiot?

02:36:27.465 --> 02:36:30.381
That wasn't a dream,
that was a memory!

02:36:30.424 --> 02:36:32.121
Wait! Wait! Wait!

02:36:32.165 --> 02:36:33.819
Mommy, wait!

02:36:53.186 --> 02:36:56.145
-Oh... Oh... No.

02:36:56.189 --> 02:36:58.191
- Come on...

02:37:18.603 --> 02:37:19.604
No...

02:37:23.912 --> 02:37:25.348
Beau?

02:37:29.004 --> 02:37:32.225
My beautiful boy.

02:37:32.268 --> 02:37:35.228
Oh, Beau, don't be afraid.

02:38:20.882 --> 02:38:23.972
-No!

02:38:47.039 --> 02:38:50.521
-Oh, God. Oh, baby.

02:38:50.564 --> 02:38:53.567
Baby, sweetheart.

02:38:53.611 --> 02:38:56.135
Ooh, sweetheart.

02:38:56.178 --> 02:38:57.876
I didn't want you to know.

02:38:59.486 --> 02:39:01.532
Do you see now why I lied?

02:39:02.402 --> 02:39:03.403
Beau.

02:39:04.056 --> 02:39:05.057
Beau!

02:39:06.362 --> 02:39:07.712
That was your father.

02:39:08.887 --> 02:39:12.368
Oh, Mom! Oh, Mom!

02:39:12.412 --> 02:39:15.197
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:39:15.241 --> 02:39:17.896
I know I've been a bad son.
I'll be a good son.

02:39:17.939 --> 02:39:19.375
Please! I'm sorry.

02:39:19.419 --> 02:39:21.290
I'll do anything
to make it up to you.

02:39:21.334 --> 02:39:22.683
I'll make it up to you.

02:39:22.727 --> 02:39:25.033
Please, please. Please!

02:39:25.077 --> 02:39:27.035
Please, I'm sorry.

02:39:27.079 --> 02:39:28.471
You selfish little boy!

02:39:28.515 --> 02:39:30.430
-I'm sorry...
-What are you crying about?

02:39:30.473 --> 02:39:32.214
Do you have any idea
what I had to go through

02:39:32.258 --> 02:39:33.999
to bring you into this world?

02:39:34.042 --> 02:39:35.174
Stand up!

02:39:40.919 --> 02:39:42.616
You cry now?

02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:45.097
You need a mother now?

02:39:45.140 --> 02:39:47.055
Ever since you clawed
your way out of me,

02:39:47.099 --> 02:39:49.754
I've had to dig down deep
to my very bottom

02:39:49.797 --> 02:39:51.320
and squeeze
the love out of myself,

02:39:51.364 --> 02:39:54.019
but still I gave it to you.

02:39:54.062 --> 02:39:57.413
I've given you
my whole fucking life!

02:39:57.457 --> 02:40:00.155
Which you took,
and you took, and you took,

02:40:00.199 --> 02:40:03.071
and I squeezed myself empty!

02:40:04.029 --> 02:40:06.422
I gave you everything!

02:40:06.466 --> 02:40:09.643
And what do I get back?
What do I have?

02:40:09.687 --> 02:40:13.038
Insults! And empty promises!

02:40:13.081 --> 02:40:16.911
You promised to never hurt me.
Do you even remember that one?

02:40:16.955 --> 02:40:19.740
You promised it
a hundred fucking times!

02:40:19.784 --> 02:40:22.177
You swore on your own life!

02:40:22.221 --> 02:40:24.397
But your promises
are nothing but shit!

02:40:26.355 --> 02:40:28.662
I've been ground down
to nothing

02:40:28.706 --> 02:40:30.882
by love and panic and worry.

02:40:30.925 --> 02:40:33.319
Is my baby hungry?
Is he healthy?

02:40:33.362 --> 02:40:36.104
Is he scared enough?
Of the world?

02:40:37.149 --> 02:40:38.977
And the fruit
of all this anguish?

02:40:39.455 --> 02:40:40.718
Is grief!

02:40:42.415 --> 02:40:43.634
And hatred!

02:40:48.464 --> 02:40:50.075
Yes. Yes.

02:40:50.118 --> 02:40:51.772
Hatred. I do.

02:40:52.512 --> 02:40:53.600
I do!

02:40:54.209 --> 02:40:55.210
I hate...

02:41:19.408 --> 02:41:21.019
Mommy?

02:41:21.062 --> 02:41:23.412
Are you okay? You...

02:41:23.456 --> 02:41:24.849
You can breathe.
Can you breathe?

02:41:24.892 --> 02:41:26.067
Can you breathe?

02:41:27.112 --> 02:41:28.853
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to.

02:41:28.896 --> 02:41:30.593
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

02:41:31.812 --> 02:41:33.640
Are you okay? Are you okay?

02:45:30.442 --> 02:45:31.965
Beau Isaac Wassermann.

02:45:32.009 --> 02:45:35.055
Born May 10th, 1975.

02:45:49.548 --> 02:45:50.766
Proceed.

02:45:52.203 --> 02:45:56.163
We are gathered now
to assess the extent...

02:45:58.078 --> 02:45:59.950
of the subject's guilt.

02:46:03.257 --> 02:46:08.262
To begin with, a seemingly
innocuous tradition.

02:46:10.961 --> 02:46:13.615
Every Monday before
his weekly appointment

02:46:13.659 --> 02:46:15.400
to scapegoat his mother,

02:46:15.443 --> 02:46:19.665
the subject would visit his
local pond to feed the ducks.

02:46:19.708 --> 02:46:22.363
Just as he never missed
an opportunity

02:46:22.407 --> 02:46:24.757
to feed his therapist's fish.

02:46:25.584 --> 02:46:26.802
Very nice.

02:46:28.065 --> 02:46:29.414
Very nice.

02:46:30.110 --> 02:46:32.417
But what happens

02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:37.248
when he meets a human beggar
that very night?

02:46:40.164 --> 02:46:42.427
Now, one can see

02:46:42.470 --> 02:46:44.255
that the subject
will go out of his way

02:46:44.298 --> 02:46:46.474
to feed a bird or fish,

02:46:46.518 --> 02:46:48.476
but not to support

02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:51.914
a suffering member
of his own species.

02:46:51.958 --> 02:46:53.351
Objection!

02:46:53.394 --> 02:46:55.701
Violent street crimes
were everywhere on the news

02:46:55.744 --> 02:46:59.357
and everyone was advised
to avoid strangers!

02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:01.881
This is nothing new!

02:47:01.924 --> 02:47:04.971
The subject
has thoughts every day

02:47:05.015 --> 02:47:07.800
around relieving the suffering
of those less fortunate!

02:47:07.843 --> 02:47:09.193
By all indications,

02:47:09.236 --> 02:47:12.109
he has a healthy,
functioning conscience!

02:47:12.152 --> 02:47:14.720
He just chose to ignore it!

02:47:15.851 --> 02:47:17.462
Consider
the following episode.

02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:20.900
Day 49 of his ninth year.

02:47:20.943 --> 02:47:22.684
He goes shopping
with his mother.

02:47:23.642 --> 02:47:25.296
At one point, she lost him,

02:47:26.297 --> 02:47:28.038
or so she thought.

02:47:28.995 --> 02:47:31.606
Fearing the worst, she panics.

02:47:31.650 --> 02:47:33.086
She searches the building.

02:47:33.130 --> 02:47:36.916
She cries out for the boy,
who was in fact

02:47:36.959 --> 02:47:39.266
hiding behind a corner,

02:47:39.310 --> 02:47:41.312
watching the whole thing.

02:47:41.355 --> 02:47:43.836
My client was genuinely lost.

02:47:43.879 --> 02:47:45.838
It was upon
finding his mother,

02:47:45.881 --> 02:47:49.059
seeing her frantic state,
that he hesitated

02:47:49.102 --> 02:47:50.712
for fear of punishment!

02:47:50.756 --> 02:47:52.671
MONA'S ATTORNEY: It was
in this frantic state of mind

02:47:52.714 --> 02:47:55.674
that his mother
tripped and fell,

02:47:55.717 --> 02:47:59.069
tearing ligaments in her knee
and badly harming her ankle.

02:48:00.461 --> 02:48:02.333
And still

02:48:02.376 --> 02:48:04.335
the subject did not intervene!

02:48:04.378 --> 02:48:06.641
He was afraid!

02:48:06.685 --> 02:48:09.688
MONA'S ATTORNEY: Consider now
the subject at age 15,

02:48:10.515 --> 02:48:13.170
day 210,

02:48:13.213 --> 02:48:17.174
finding himself in the rare
company of other boys.

02:48:17.217 --> 02:48:23.267
The subject, hoping to impress
his horrendous new friends,

02:48:23.310 --> 02:48:25.138
invites them into his home,

02:48:25.182 --> 02:48:28.446
while his mother
is out buying him...

02:48:28.489 --> 02:48:31.753
-...gifts for his birthday.

02:48:31.797 --> 02:48:35.583
He lets them
into her private bathroom,

02:48:35.627 --> 02:48:39.761
and allows them to rifle
through her dirty laundry,

02:48:39.805 --> 02:48:45.680
and inspect and ultimately
steal her undergarments.

02:48:45.724 --> 02:48:48.074
Oh, God. Oh, God.

02:48:48.118 --> 02:48:50.120
They pressured me!
They pressured me!

02:48:50.163 --> 02:48:51.208
They pressured him!

02:48:51.251 --> 02:48:52.513
What? What are you doing?

02:48:53.253 --> 02:48:55.734
-What?
-No. No!

02:48:55.777 --> 02:48:57.344
-No!

02:48:57.388 --> 02:49:00.478
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

02:49:00.521 --> 02:49:03.916
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

02:49:03.959 --> 02:49:06.832
Even his supposed acts
of thoughtfulness

02:49:06.875 --> 02:49:09.530
are emblematic
of a greater hypocrisy.

02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:13.578
Take this very week.

02:49:13.621 --> 02:49:16.972
The subject asked Grace
and Roger to drive him home

02:49:17.016 --> 02:49:19.279
so that he might
bury his mother

02:49:19.323 --> 02:49:21.194
and commence proper mourning.

02:49:21.238 --> 02:49:24.284
Roger offered the option

02:49:25.067 --> 02:49:26.895
of driving home tonight

02:49:26.939 --> 02:49:28.941
if the offer
of driving tomorrow

02:49:28.984 --> 02:49:30.943
wasn't soon enough.

02:49:30.986 --> 02:49:35.513
And Beau chose
to drive home tomorrow,

02:49:35.556 --> 02:49:37.123
further postponing a trip

02:49:37.167 --> 02:49:40.518
that had already been
outrageously delayed!

02:49:40.561 --> 02:49:43.738
And if one examines
the expression on his face

02:49:43.782 --> 02:49:45.914
when Roger made
this challenge,

02:49:47.002 --> 02:49:48.961
one can only conclude

02:49:49.004 --> 02:49:52.530
that the subject was panicked
at the idea of returning home.

02:49:53.618 --> 02:49:55.446
I didn't want to put him out!

02:49:55.489 --> 02:49:58.362
I... He had surgeries!

02:50:01.452 --> 02:50:04.890
I cried!
When I was beside the coffin!

02:50:04.933 --> 02:50:07.284
When I was told the news!

02:50:07.327 --> 02:50:10.591
I... I... I cried for hours!

02:50:10.635 --> 02:50:12.593
Continuing
to bear this in mind,

02:50:13.855 --> 02:50:18.512
I ask you
to consider yesterday.

02:50:18.556 --> 02:50:22.429
Not three hours after meeting
a knocked up dimwit

02:50:22.473 --> 02:50:24.475
who made clumsy eyes at him,

02:50:24.518 --> 02:50:28.261
did he gift her
with a tributary gift

02:50:28.305 --> 02:50:32.570
intended for no one less than
his recently deceased mother.

02:50:33.614 --> 02:50:35.442
Now, when the pregnant slut

02:50:35.486 --> 02:50:38.445
offered to return
the special gift,

02:50:38.489 --> 02:50:42.536
did he insist that
this total stranger keep...

02:50:59.858 --> 02:51:00.859
Oh!

02:51:01.555 --> 02:51:03.340
No! No! Wait!

02:51:03.383 --> 02:51:04.645
Wait! Stop!

02:51:05.167 --> 02:51:06.560
Wait!

02:51:06.604 --> 02:51:09.563
My legs! My legs are stuck!

02:51:09.607 --> 02:51:12.131
What! Wait!

02:51:12.174 --> 02:51:14.916
Wait, Mom! My legs!
My legs, I can't Move!

02:51:21.358 --> 02:51:22.402
What?

02:51:22.446 --> 02:51:24.883
Mommy, please!

02:51:25.623 --> 02:51:27.538
Please help me! Please!

02:51:29.322 --> 02:51:31.324
Please help me out! Please!

02:51:31.368 --> 02:51:34.719
Please! Please don't fault me!

02:51:34.762 --> 02:51:37.635
Help! Help me!

02:51:37.678 --> 02:51:39.637
Somebody help me, please!

02:51:39.680 --> 02:51:42.466
Help! Help!

02:51:43.162 --> 02:51:44.903
Help me, please!

02:51:44.946 --> 02:51:47.035
Help! Please!

02:51:47.079 --> 02:51:49.603
Please! I don't want to die!
I don't want to...

02:53:14.862 --> 02:53:17.778
No! My baby! No!

02:53:18.518 --> 02:53:19.780
My baby.

02:53:26.047 --> 02:53:27.353
My baby.

02:53:38.973 --> 02:53:41.411
My baby.

02:53:44.022 --> 02:53:46.241
My baby.
