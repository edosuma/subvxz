WEBVTT

00:18.533 --> 00:20.567
Okay Mom, we have to go.

00:20.633 --> 00:22.367
Why don't you
and Jeff show

00:22.433 --> 00:24.167
Mariah and Cameron
around before homeroom?

00:24.233 --> 00:25.500
Yeah sure.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.500
We'll be fine, it's
not the first time

00:27.567 --> 00:29.033
we've switched
schools suddenly.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.867
Not that we'll
broadcast that.

00:31.933 --> 00:33.900
Mom, we're gonna
get a late slip, so...

00:33.967 --> 00:35.033
Yeah, okay great.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.867
Hey guys: love you!

00:36.933 --> 00:39.500
Love you too.

00:40.267 --> 00:41.667
Better run guys.

00:46.967 --> 00:48.567
If Cameron and Mariah
like the school,

00:48.633 --> 00:50.900
then our lives get a little
easier, don't they?

00:50.967 --> 00:52.800
We just doubled the number
of teenagers in our life.

00:52.867 --> 00:55.600
I don't even know the
word "easy" anymore.

00:55.667 --> 00:57.067
I'm gonna get a late
slip, I gotta go.

00:57.133 --> 00:59.600
Okay... oh no don't go.

01:00.533 --> 01:01.867
We could get detention.

01:01.933 --> 01:04.933
Let's make it worth it.

01:08.933 --> 01:12.767
We're gonna need a bigger car
now that we have six people.

01:12.833 --> 01:14.167
I know.

01:14.233 --> 01:17.667
How about six Lamborghinis,
duct-taped together?

01:33.167 --> 01:34.733
Ever been here?

01:34.800 --> 01:36.367
Their salmon en croÃ»te is
supposed to be amazing.

01:36.433 --> 01:39.500
I've never been, but I
recommended a kid for a job.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.700
I thought this was run
and staffed by ex-cons.

01:41.767 --> 01:43.933
Yeah, I met him
in the system.

01:44.067 --> 01:47.100
He's not our vic.

01:47.167 --> 01:49.700
Morning officer.

01:49.767 --> 01:51.067
Officer Hamilton,
first on scene?

01:51.067 --> 01:52.467
Yes, ma'am.

01:52.533 --> 01:53.733
These individuals
are kitchen staff

01:53.800 --> 01:55.367
who arrived this morning
for their prep shift.

01:55.433 --> 01:57.167
The young woman right here
discovered the deceased,

01:57.233 --> 01:58.600
and they called
it in immediately.

01:58.667 --> 01:59.900
Anybody give you trouble?

02:00.067 --> 02:02.067
We're not idiots.

02:02.067 --> 02:04.833
Everyone here has done time,
so they all know the process.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.167
Thank you officer,
all we need now

02:06.233 --> 02:07.967
is the medical
examiner and the body.

02:08.067 --> 02:10.233
Right inside.

02:18.067 --> 02:19.333
Hey Leslie.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.067
Allison, Devin.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.133
Sorry, I should've told them
to warn you you'd need a coat.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.067
So this is Marco Mazetti?

02:25.067 --> 02:26.400
Yeah, the head chef.

02:26.467 --> 02:27.667
Talented guy, it's a shame.

02:27.733 --> 02:29.100
Isn't it always?

02:29.167 --> 02:31.567
Preliminary indications,
COD is blunt force trauma.

02:31.633 --> 02:33.267
Side and back of the head.

02:33.333 --> 02:36.067
So the lighter frost between
the body and the door...

02:36.067 --> 02:38.300
Killed outside
and dragged in?

02:38.367 --> 02:39.867
That's what I'm thinking.

02:39.933 --> 02:41.433
When?

02:41.500 --> 02:42.733
The refrigeration
complicates that,

02:42.800 --> 02:44.900
but I'm estimating
between midnight and 2:00 AM.

02:44.967 --> 02:47.800
I'll try again
when he warms up.

02:47.867 --> 02:50.067
What are you thinking
for a weapon?

02:50.067 --> 02:52.300
Broad and heavy.

02:52.367 --> 02:55.900
Boom, boom.

03:00.867 --> 03:04.167
We're sorry for your loss,
and we thank you for your help,

03:04.233 --> 03:06.467
especially your
preliminary statements.

03:06.533 --> 03:08.800
We're going to need to talk
to each of you in more depth.

03:08.867 --> 03:10.733
About your boss,
how everyone got along,

03:10.800 --> 03:12.067
that sort of thing.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.800
Thank you Miss Detective,

03:13.867 --> 03:15.800
but we've done all
the talking we're gonna.

03:15.867 --> 03:17.067
Everyone here knows
nothing good ever came

03:17.067 --> 03:18.967
from talking
to the police.

03:19.067 --> 03:20.633
And since we
ain't working today,

03:20.700 --> 03:22.433
I got plenty
better places to be.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.100
Oscar, tell them you
know how to cooperate.

03:25.167 --> 03:27.400
Let them do their jobs.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.600
You think Marco
left you in charge, Ella?

03:29.667 --> 03:31.367
You think you can boss me?

03:31.433 --> 03:33.367
Hey! Show some
respect, Oscar.

03:33.433 --> 03:34.800
For Ella and
Detective McLean.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.300
Get off it Jordan,
don't play

03:36.367 --> 03:37.433
that shining armor
stuff with me.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.767
That's enough.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.400
Detective McLean has
always been good to me.

03:40.467 --> 03:42.533
Oh yeah?

03:42.600 --> 03:43.900
How good?

03:43.967 --> 03:46.700
Hey enough!

03:46.767 --> 03:50.733
We have all the trouble
we need already, right?

03:50.800 --> 03:54.533
Settle down.

04:10.367 --> 04:12.700
Are you kidding me?

04:12.767 --> 04:14.800
Mariah, how has
your skirt shrunk

04:14.867 --> 04:17.967
since we got out
of the car?

04:18.067 --> 04:20.300
Nice, you lost a couple
of buttons, too.

04:20.367 --> 04:21.733
I didn't notice.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.933
Well, notice.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.600
I don't see a problem.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.567
Unroll your skirt and
button your blouse.

04:27.633 --> 04:29.833
Then buy a neon sign
that says, "Notice me."

04:29.900 --> 04:31.667
It's just as subtle, but
you won't get busted

04:31.733 --> 04:33.233
for dress code
violations.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.300
No.

04:35.367 --> 04:38.533
Excuse me?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.833
If I have to start over,

04:40.900 --> 04:43.267
I'm gonna do it
the way I want.

04:43.333 --> 04:46.133
Don't get in my way.

04:49.300 --> 04:52.133
Leslie says we're looking for
an 8-9 inch cast iron pan.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.600
We've requested an
inventory list

04:53.667 --> 04:56.067
to compare against
what the Unis counted.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.500
There's very little
blood splatter,

04:57.567 --> 04:59.533
all under the lip of the
counter of the center island.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.933
Trace fibers, probably
from the cloths

05:02.067 --> 05:04.467
similar to the ones
found in the kitchen.

05:04.533 --> 05:06.300
Nothing recovered in
any of the trash bins

05:06.367 --> 05:08.333
in the parking lot or
the immediate vicinity.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.467
Nothing.

05:11.533 --> 05:15.200
So, the kid who was demanding
respect on your behalf,

05:15.267 --> 05:17.367
is he the one you
helped get the job?

05:17.433 --> 05:18.533
Yeah, Jordan.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.067
I busted him when
he was a juvenile.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.433
He made some
stupid choices,

05:21.500 --> 05:23.800
but I always thought
there was more to him.

05:23.867 --> 05:25.900
You know the type?

05:25.967 --> 05:27.467
Why'd he do real time?

05:27.533 --> 05:28.967
Assault, first degree.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.767
But after he got out,
he came to me

05:30.833 --> 05:33.867
and I wrote him a letter of
recommendation for Prison Food.

05:33.933 --> 05:36.900
Last I heard, Marco thought
he had a lot of promise.

05:36.967 --> 05:42.100
Hard to lose a mentor.

05:42.167 --> 05:45.133
The website says Marco is never
without his orange chef's cap.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.067
I don't remember seeing
one at the crime scene.

05:47.100 --> 05:50.267
No, we didn't.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.200
Maybe the cap, the pan,
and the cloth

05:52.267 --> 05:53.200
are all together
somewhere.

05:53.267 --> 05:54.867
Who can tell us where?

05:54.933 --> 05:56.900
Did you upload that file
of everybody working

05:56.967 --> 05:58.067
at the restaurant
this morning?

05:58.133 --> 06:00.467
I did, name and jacket.

06:00.533 --> 06:02.567
Let's winnow them down
by what we know so far.

06:02.633 --> 06:04.067
Based on the angle
of impact,

06:04.100 --> 06:06.067
Leslie says our killer
is at least 5'9.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.067
Down to seven.

06:10.133 --> 06:12.667
Right-handed?

06:12.733 --> 06:14.733
No lefties, still seven.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.133
Violent offenders?

06:18.200 --> 06:19.533
Down to four!

06:19.600 --> 06:22.167
Anger management issues?

06:22.233 --> 06:24.467
Survey says...?

06:24.533 --> 06:28.400
Oscar... and Jordan.

06:53.533 --> 06:55.533
This doesn't make sense.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.367
Jordan told me he was
happy at Prison Food.

06:57.433 --> 06:58.500
Would he tell you
if he wasn't?

06:58.567 --> 06:59.633
He would.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.067
I don't see how
he's our killer.

07:01.133 --> 07:02.667
I think we should
focus on Oscar.

07:02.733 --> 07:04.100
Excuse me.

07:04.167 --> 07:06.867
Are you the detectives
investigating Mario Mazetti?

07:06.933 --> 07:08.333
His umm...

07:08.400 --> 07:10.600
I'm Detective Stewart, this is
my partner, Detective McLean.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.333
We're working the
Mazetti homicide.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.333
You are...?

07:13.400 --> 07:14.400
Mitchell Perkins.

07:14.467 --> 07:15.967
I do the accounting
for Prison Food.

07:16.067 --> 07:23.733
I come in later - they called.
I just can't believe that...

07:25.633 --> 07:28.067
I was told you needed
a kitchen inventory.

07:28.133 --> 07:30.700
I printed it out, I can go
over it with you if you like.

07:30.767 --> 07:32.067
Thank you.

07:32.067 --> 07:35.633
We're very sorry for
your loss, Mitchell.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.567
How long have you been
working at Prison Food?

07:38.633 --> 07:40.400
Two years.

07:40.467 --> 07:42.300
I studied accounting
in prison.

07:42.367 --> 07:44.400
I wanted some options
when I got out.

07:44.467 --> 07:50.067
Marco gave me a second
chance in the truest sense.

07:50.067 --> 07:51.667
We understand this is a
difficult time,

07:51.733 --> 07:55.400
so we appreciate
the quick response.

07:55.467 --> 07:57.200
Was anything missing?

07:57.267 --> 08:01.233
Yes, a couple of
cookware items were gone.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.667
Like an eight-inch
cast iron skillet?

08:03.733 --> 08:07.167
No, nine-inch.
Why?

08:07.233 --> 08:08.600
Thank you very
much for coming in,

08:08.667 --> 08:11.633
we'll be in touch.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.833
Unless there's
something else?

08:15.900 --> 08:18.467
Maybe someone
already told you.

08:18.533 --> 08:20.233
Earlier this week,
Marco caught Jordan

08:20.300 --> 08:22.300
taking money out
of the register.

08:22.367 --> 08:24.067
We're a cash only restaurant,

08:24.067 --> 08:25.833
so there's always
a lot in there.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.733
He told me to cut Jordan
a severance check,

08:27.800 --> 08:29.533
but then he changed
his mind.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.133
He said he wanted
to talk to him

08:31.200 --> 08:33.133
and give him one last
chance to explain.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.800
When were they
going to talk?

08:36.867 --> 08:40.300
Last night.

08:40.367 --> 08:42.067
Thank you.

08:42.133 --> 08:44.067
Whoever told you that
story is crazy.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.700
Tell us about your relationship
with Marco, Jordan.

08:46.767 --> 08:50.467
I liked him,
he taught me a lot.

08:50.533 --> 08:52.333
Did you fight?

08:52.400 --> 08:54.100
Course we did.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.600
Cause we both wanted
things to be right, y'know?

08:57.667 --> 09:00.767
"Cook the way you
live. With passion."

09:00.833 --> 09:02.333
That's what
Marco says.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.900
So you didn't get along?

09:03.967 --> 09:07.233
No, we got along
great, like family.

09:07.300 --> 09:11.600
We'd fight and make up,
and then fight again.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.667
Like brothers.

09:13.733 --> 09:15.333
Brothers who steal
from each other?

09:15.400 --> 09:17.267
That story is crap.

09:17.333 --> 09:20.600
I was never in the drawer and
Marco was never gonna fire me.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.233
And last night, I left with
everyone else when we closed up.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.900
Where'd you go after that?

09:24.967 --> 09:26.233
Home.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.067
To bed, alone.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.567
Doesn't help,
but it's the truth.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.600
Who was it?

09:34.667 --> 09:37.900
I know you've thought
about it, tell me.

09:37.967 --> 09:40.367
You want somebody with
a grudge against Marco,

09:40.433 --> 09:41.967
you talk to Oscar.

09:42.067 --> 09:43.833
The guy you threw
down with this morning?

09:43.900 --> 09:45.633
That hothead always
thinks he's right

09:45.700 --> 09:47.733
and everybody
else is wrong.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.167
He's always running
his mouth about how

09:50.233 --> 09:52.300
he can run the restaurant
better than Marco.

09:52.367 --> 09:54.067
Even about how he's
gonna get out of Prison Food

09:54.133 --> 09:56.533
and start his own place.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.367
Yeah, right.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.600
Wonder what Oscar
would say about that?

10:03.333 --> 10:05.033
The kitchen is
full of fools.

10:05.100 --> 10:07.700
And Jordan, he's the
biggest one of all.

10:07.767 --> 10:09.400
Where were you last
night after closing?

10:09.467 --> 10:11.500
Home, in bed.

10:11.567 --> 10:14.433
We hustle in that kitchen,
it wears you down.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.267
How bad were the problems
between you and Marco?

10:17.333 --> 10:19.733
They didn't exist.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.233
He was very supportive,
and I appreciated that.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.567
He liked the idea of you
having your own place?

10:32.667 --> 10:35.167
He admired ambition.

10:35.233 --> 10:37.300
And I've got that.

10:37.367 --> 10:40.400
But I still have a lot to learn
before I can stand on my own,

10:40.467 --> 10:42.933
and I was happy
learning from Marco.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.700
So now you maybe you
can become head chef?

10:45.767 --> 10:47.200
Run Prison Food your way.

10:47.267 --> 10:48.800
No one else can
wear Marco's cap.

10:48.867 --> 10:50.133
You willing to try?

10:50.200 --> 10:54.033
We'll be lucky to
stay open without him.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.633
But we better.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.900
Us guys in the kitchen, we're
not exactly the type of people

10:57.967 --> 11:01.967
that get snapped up off
job market, y'know?

11:02.067 --> 11:05.067
So you and Marco
were close.

11:05.133 --> 11:07.067
But there's always somebody.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.767
Who in the kitchen had
problems with Marco?

11:12.067 --> 11:14.867
Jordan.
They fought all the time.

11:14.933 --> 11:16.200
Jordan thinks he's
some great chef,

11:16.267 --> 11:17.733
and Marco's protÃ©gÃ©,
but he's not.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.433
And you are?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.133
Better than Jordan.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.267
He's not fast enough, sharp
enough, or inventive enough,

11:24.333 --> 11:27.800
and he made Marco crazy.

11:27.867 --> 11:30.067
Guess now he made Marco dead.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.433
Hey gang!

11:46.900 --> 11:52.500
Mariah, Cameron,
how'd your day go?

11:54.667 --> 11:55.933
Fine.

11:56.067 --> 11:59.700
I made some friends,
Uncle Matt.

11:59.767 --> 12:03.100
Mom- Aunt Allison and I
have to do something tonight.

12:03.167 --> 12:05.800
You guys want to cook or do
you want to order pizza?

12:05.867 --> 12:09.133
Pizza!

12:09.200 --> 12:12.233
Okay.

12:21.067 --> 12:22.567
Seems your boy
Jordan has a temper.

12:22.633 --> 12:23.633
He also has an alibi.

12:23.700 --> 12:24.967
One we can't confirm.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.133
And he fits the profile.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.467
And he's been accused of theft.

12:28.533 --> 12:30.533
Everything points to Jordan,
and all he can offer

12:30.600 --> 12:32.133
in defense is that
he hates Oscar.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.867
Who also fits the profile.

12:33.933 --> 12:35.233
I'm not saying we don't look.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.867
I'm just saying, it might
not be that simple.

12:36.933 --> 12:38.400
We need to go through
Jordan's stuff.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.267
Search for money, the
weapon, the cap...

12:40.333 --> 12:44.700
The bloody cloths,
yes, I know.

12:44.767 --> 12:46.533
I'm getting a warrant.

12:46.600 --> 12:50.567
We'll have it in hand
first thing tomorrow.

12:55.667 --> 12:59.567
I'm glad that Cameron
and Mariah are with you.

12:59.633 --> 13:07.167
I can't think of a better place
for them to be while I'm...

13:07.233 --> 13:11.367
Thank you for looking out
for your niece and nephew.

13:11.433 --> 13:15.100
I'm glad you think so
since Tim didn't like the idea.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.967
Of course Tim's not going to
want you to have the kids.

13:18.067 --> 13:24.267
Come on... his own sister
put him to prison.

13:24.333 --> 13:28.167
He's gonna be pissed at you
for the rest of the century.

13:28.233 --> 13:29.733
Tim might want to take
responsibility

13:29.800 --> 13:35.067
for what he's done
in his own life.

13:35.933 --> 13:39.667
One of the things that
I'm learning in rehab,

13:39.733 --> 13:42.833
is that I need to
let people help me.

13:42.900 --> 13:47.067
So that's what I'm doing,
I'm letting you help me.

13:50.067 --> 13:53.300
Us, all of us...
of course.

13:53.367 --> 13:56.200
Think maybe you could mention
that when you talk to Tim?

13:56.267 --> 13:58.500
Sure, yeah.

13:58.567 --> 14:01.533
How often do you guys
get to talking?

14:03.567 --> 14:06.100
Sorry.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.933
Here.

14:10.133 --> 14:14.400
No! I didn't even see that!

14:14.467 --> 14:17.333
I had it all wrapped
when I got here.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.867
They go through
everything here.

14:18.933 --> 14:21.167
It's like if a guy tried
to bring his girlfriend

14:21.233 --> 14:23.233
cocaine in a toothpaste
tube or something.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.200
Do you think we could bring
Mariah and Cameron

14:25.267 --> 14:30.067
the next time we come?

14:30.100 --> 14:32.367
Oh, no, no.

14:32.433 --> 14:34.800
I need to focus on
my program.

14:34.867 --> 14:40.067
That is what's best,
for me and for them.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.667
I'm working really hard.

14:42.733 --> 14:46.100
And I'm gonna get out
of here soon, I promise.

14:46.167 --> 14:48.667
I really feel it.

14:48.733 --> 14:52.133
So the money that the county's
been giving you for the kids,

14:52.200 --> 14:56.300
is that in a bank account,
what're you doing with it?

14:56.367 --> 14:58.100
We're feeding them.

15:01.267 --> 15:05.100
But you're supposed
to be saving that for me.

15:05.167 --> 15:09.367
For when I get out, so I can
take care of the kids, right?

15:09.433 --> 15:10.567
Right?

15:26.367 --> 15:29.367
That was surprising,
even for Jackie.

15:29.433 --> 15:30.833
I know I'm not perfect.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.833
Don't shatter my illusions.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.933
But I try.

15:35.067 --> 15:38.933
I can't remember the last time
Jackie put effort into anything.

15:39.067 --> 15:42.200
Want me to drive around
the block one more time?

15:42.267 --> 15:44.800
No, I won't let the
kids see I'm upset.

15:44.867 --> 15:47.567
I just want Cameron and
Mariah to see their parents.

15:47.633 --> 15:50.467
And I want their parents
to want to see them.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.233
At least Jackie understands
that Cameron and Mariah

15:52.300 --> 15:55.300
are better off with us.

15:55.367 --> 15:57.133
If Tim sees that
she's on our side,

15:57.200 --> 15:58.500
then maybe he'll
stop fighting us

15:58.567 --> 16:02.767
and we can move
forward from here.

16:02.833 --> 16:05.533
You're right.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.733
You know if I drive two blocks,
there's that Baskin Robbins.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.800
You're a good man,
Matt McLean.

16:18.067 --> 16:20.133
It's not like I had a
huge room to begin,

16:20.200 --> 16:22.233
now I have to squeeze
into half the space.

16:22.300 --> 16:25.200
And she uses this shampoo with
such a strong coconut smell

16:25.267 --> 16:27.567
that my bathroom ends up
smelling like sunscreen.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.467
I guess I feel
bad for her and all,

16:29.533 --> 16:33.067
but I wish I felt bad for her
by myself, in my own room.

16:33.067 --> 16:34.400
Jeff, what's going on?

16:34.467 --> 16:35.767
I need to talk to you.

16:35.833 --> 16:37.167
Okay, we'll talk
on the way home.

16:37.233 --> 16:40.567
I need to talk to you now.

16:41.733 --> 16:43.600
I'll catch up with
you guys later.

16:43.667 --> 16:44.800
See you, Rachel.

16:44.867 --> 16:45.900
What's wrong?

16:45.967 --> 16:47.067
Where's Cameron and Mariah?

16:47.133 --> 16:48.267
I don't know, why?

16:48.333 --> 16:50.233
Mom said we need to
keep an eye on them.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.767
Yeah, but we still need
to go to our own classes.

16:52.833 --> 16:54.333
We should arrange
to meet up with them.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.733
To check in.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.100
You'll have English
with her.

16:57.167 --> 16:58.867
And I'll see him in P.E.,
but that's later and I-

16:58.933 --> 17:00.367
Listen, If you're really
worried, we can check-

17:00.433 --> 17:02.333
They need to like it here.

17:02.400 --> 17:05.667
They will, eventually.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.500
It's important to Mom.

17:07.567 --> 17:10.633
We can't disappoint her.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.267
You're right.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.200
Ellie's in her history class,
so I'll get an update from her.

17:16.267 --> 17:18.967
And we can find them at
lunch and all sit together.

17:19.067 --> 17:22.167
Hey, don't get crazy.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.100
Thank you for meeting us.

17:29.167 --> 17:32.067
Of course, anything
I can do to help.

17:32.067 --> 17:33.733
So you do think
it was Jordan?

17:33.800 --> 17:35.200
We're still investigating,
Mr. Perkins.

17:35.267 --> 17:37.800
We need to be thorough.

17:37.867 --> 17:39.100
This is his here.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.633
I'm sorry I don't
have a key.

17:40.700 --> 17:45.200
No problem, we have a
warrant and we have these.

17:58.233 --> 18:02.067
Allison.

18:08.633 --> 18:10.067
I'm being framed.

18:10.133 --> 18:12.233
If you didn't take the money,
how did it get in your locker?

18:12.300 --> 18:14.067
Cheap locks? I don't know.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.600
And do I look stupid enough to
put money from the restaurant

18:16.667 --> 18:18.300
in my locker in
the restaurant?

18:18.367 --> 18:20.400
No, but you look smart
enough to put it there

18:20.467 --> 18:23.067
so you can act hurt and
innocent when we find it.

18:23.133 --> 18:24.600
Who would want
to frame you?

18:24.667 --> 18:25.867
Oscar.

18:25.933 --> 18:27.267
You and Oscar keep
pointing at each other

18:27.333 --> 18:28.300
like kids on a playground.

18:28.367 --> 18:29.800
What is going
on between you two?

18:29.867 --> 18:31.333
I don't want to
be any man's enemy.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.933
But this guy is
always in my face,

18:33.067 --> 18:35.300
challenging me, provoking me.

18:35.367 --> 18:37.400
I have no fight with him.

18:37.467 --> 18:38.967
I am happy where
I am and I would

18:39.067 --> 18:40.267
never do anything
to screw that up.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.200
Even though Marco thought
you were second rate.

18:42.267 --> 18:43.333
He did not.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.933
Even though he liked
Oscar more than you.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.233
He did not.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.067
Even though he accused
you of stealing this money,

18:48.100 --> 18:49.900
which you did, because we
found it in your locker.

18:49.967 --> 18:53.167
He did not and I did not.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.300
Why won't
you let us help you?

18:54.367 --> 18:55.933
Because I didn't kill Marco.

18:56.067 --> 18:57.433
I swear to God.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.767
Jordan, once we send the money
to Forensics and you to holding,

19:00.833 --> 19:05.533
your chance at a plea bargain
goes out the window.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.533
I didn't do it!

19:07.600 --> 19:09.467
I didn't do it!

19:09.533 --> 19:10.633
You need to think
through that approach

19:10.700 --> 19:11.833
a little bit
more carefully.

19:11.900 --> 19:16.233
Put him in holding.

19:18.800 --> 19:23.733
Detective McLean, you
said you believed in me.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.233
Nice showing out
there, Cameron.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.533
Glad to have you
at Crestview High.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.967
Thank you, coach.

19:41.067 --> 19:43.167
Did you run track
at your old school?

19:43.233 --> 19:44.733
Some.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.567
I hope you'll come
out for the team here.

19:46.633 --> 19:49.067
We could really use you,
especially in the hundred meter.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.567
Think about it.

19:50.633 --> 19:53.733
Okay, thank you.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.367
All right gentlemen,
get a move on.

19:55.433 --> 19:58.467
You're going to be
late for sixth period.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.433
Hey!

20:03.500 --> 20:07.367
Who do you think you are,
trying to steal my spot?

20:07.433 --> 20:10.067
Dude, I am not after you.

20:10.133 --> 20:12.433
I don't even know
who you are.

20:12.500 --> 20:18.300
Well, newbie, my name is Jake
and I run the hundred meter.

20:19.900 --> 20:25.467
Not fast enough, I hear.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.733
We need to book him.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.100
I believe him,
the money's a plant.

20:30.167 --> 20:32.100
Allison, stop making
excuses for him.

20:32.167 --> 20:34.667
The rest is hearsay
or circumstantial.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.267
Let's just wait until
Forensics tells us

20:36.333 --> 20:38.700
if anything ties Jordan
to the money.

20:38.767 --> 20:41.000
Other than finding
it in his locker?

20:41.067 --> 20:42.300
We need to re-canvass
the neighborhood

20:42.367 --> 20:43.833
around the restaurant.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.467
You're choosing
facts that fit your theory

20:45.533 --> 20:46.733
and ignoring
everything else.

20:46.800 --> 20:51.267
No, I'm I having
an open mind!

20:53.500 --> 20:55.067
Matt?

20:55.133 --> 20:56.367
Sorry to bother
you at work,

20:56.433 --> 20:57.900
but I just got a call
from the school.

20:57.967 --> 20:59.667
Are the kids all right?

20:59.733 --> 21:02.733
I don't know,
there's been a fight.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.067
You're lucky the principal
sent you home for the day.

21:06.067 --> 21:07.167
She could've suspended you.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.667
I know.

21:08.733 --> 21:10.200
I'm sure she's counting on the
fact it's a one-time thing.

21:10.267 --> 21:11.367
I know!

21:11.433 --> 21:13.133
Jeff, help us understand
what happened?

21:13.200 --> 21:15.133
Mrs. Dayton already
told you everything.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.933
But it doesn't track,
you're a good kid.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.567
You punched Jake because he's
mouthing off in the locker room?

21:19.633 --> 21:22.500
Because he was hassling
Cameron, okay?

21:22.567 --> 21:26.733
I was sticking up for my cousin,
I was being loyal to my family.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.767
I was doing what a
McLean is supposed to do.

21:29.833 --> 21:31.533
Didn't that
work out great?

21:31.600 --> 21:32.933
Slow down.

21:33.067 --> 21:34.400
We appreciate you
defending your cousin,

21:34.467 --> 21:36.733
but there's better
ways to handle it.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.600
Yes Dad, I know.

21:37.667 --> 21:38.800
Mrs. Dayton
already gave me

21:38.867 --> 21:42.267
the "We need to make
better choices" lecture.

21:43.167 --> 21:45.533
I just want to go home.

21:46.300 --> 21:50.967
Oh wait, things aren't
any better there!

21:57.067 --> 21:58.367
Everybody okay?

21:58.433 --> 22:00.633
Jeff got into a fight
protecting Cameron.

22:00.700 --> 22:01.800
A fight? During school?

22:01.867 --> 22:03.567
In P.E. class.

22:03.633 --> 22:05.533
He gets detention and not
suspension, thankfully.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.333
In a way, it
shows progress.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.867
That he cares enough about
Cameron to stick up for him.

22:11.933 --> 22:14.500
That silver lining
is so full of holes, my friend.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.100
I offer it to you anyways.

22:16.167 --> 22:18.200
They don't even talk to
each other at home.

22:18.267 --> 22:19.933
Unless you count the grunts
they make when playing Xbox.

22:20.067 --> 22:20.967
Do you want
some good news?

22:21.067 --> 22:22.067
Please.

22:22.067 --> 22:23.567
The money's back
from Forensics.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.267
It's clean.

22:25.333 --> 22:28.133
Too clean, actually.
No trace fibers or prints.

22:28.200 --> 22:28.700
Wiped-

22:28.767 --> 22:30.100
Scrubbed.

22:30.167 --> 22:35.533
Which supports Jordan's
claim that it was planted.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.067
So who do you think
framed him?

22:37.067 --> 22:38.633
Are we back to Oscar?

22:38.700 --> 22:41.067
I just got the surveillance
photos from the restaurant,

22:41.067 --> 22:43.100
let's see what they say.

22:43.167 --> 22:44.400
We used Leslie's time frame,

22:44.467 --> 22:47.133
so we shouldn't expect
too much traffic.

22:47.200 --> 22:51.500
I was hoping
that we'd see...

22:51.567 --> 22:52.733
Damn.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.133
So he's right across
from the restaurant.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.967
Within the time frame.

22:56.067 --> 22:58.267
What about the
other picture?

22:58.333 --> 23:00.933
Where did Jordan go?

23:01.067 --> 23:04.867
And why is he
running away?

23:07.300 --> 23:10.633
I have wanted to help you
since the day I met you.

23:10.700 --> 23:14.500
I think I've proven
that more than once.

23:24.967 --> 23:26.567
I lied.

23:26.633 --> 23:28.900
It was stupid,
I'm sorry.

23:28.967 --> 23:33.067
So tell us the truth now.

23:33.067 --> 23:34.867
That is me, outside
the restaurant.

23:34.933 --> 23:36.400
I didn't go straight home.

23:36.467 --> 23:38.267
But I didn't go in and
I didn't take the money

23:38.333 --> 23:39.933
and I didn't kill Marco.

23:40.067 --> 23:42.567
Why didn't you tell us
you were at the restaurant?

23:42.633 --> 23:44.233
Because I was
following Ella.

23:44.300 --> 23:47.100
Ella? The cook, Ella?

23:47.167 --> 23:48.700
Are you two together?

23:48.767 --> 23:53.100
No, I just love her.

23:53.167 --> 23:55.567
And she doesn't know?

23:55.633 --> 23:57.433
No.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.400
Marco has this rule
about staff dating,

23:59.467 --> 24:01.767
cause it gets messy
when people break up

24:01.833 --> 24:03.633
and still have
to work together.

24:03.700 --> 24:05.300
So I haven't
said anything.

24:05.367 --> 24:08.400
But I can't stop
thinking about her and...

24:08.467 --> 24:09.933
So you're stalking her?

24:10.067 --> 24:11.933
No!

24:12.067 --> 24:13.867
I finally got up the
nerve to tell her,

24:13.933 --> 24:15.600
so I go over and I'm
outside her apartment,

24:15.667 --> 24:17.867
and she comes out and
she's with Oscar.

24:17.933 --> 24:19.267
Are they together?

24:19.333 --> 24:21.433
Better not be.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.367
What happened
after you saw them?

24:23.433 --> 24:24.800
I followed them.

24:24.867 --> 24:26.667
I thought I could figure out if
they were more than friends

24:26.733 --> 24:28.167
if I saw where they went.

24:28.233 --> 24:30.633
And they went back
to the restaurant?

24:30.700 --> 24:32.067
Yeah.

24:32.133 --> 24:34.367
I waited across the street
so they wouldn't see me.

24:34.433 --> 24:38.433
Where did they park?

24:38.500 --> 24:40.300
Over here.

24:40.367 --> 24:42.733
And then they went
to the back door.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.667
After a while, I started to
wonder what was going on,

24:44.733 --> 24:46.233
so I thought I'd
go check it out,

24:46.300 --> 24:47.633
and then they
came back out.

24:47.700 --> 24:49.200
I ran so they
wouldn't see me.

24:49.267 --> 24:51.533
What time was this?

24:51.600 --> 24:53.633
12:30, 1:00.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.867
So how long were
they in the restaurant?

24:56.933 --> 25:00.567
I didn't say anything because
I know Ella is a good person,

25:00.633 --> 25:02.167
and I don't wanna
make her look bad.

25:02.233 --> 25:08.967
Jordan, how long were
they in the restaurant?

25:09.067 --> 25:13.400
Long enough to kill Marco.

25:17.667 --> 25:19.067
Did I look like
I needed help?

25:19.133 --> 25:20.300
Yes, you did.

25:20.367 --> 25:21.400
You're an idiot.

25:21.467 --> 25:22.733
I should've let
them beat you up.

25:22.800 --> 25:23.733
Rachel, tell them
to stop fighting.

25:23.800 --> 25:24.900
I'm staying out
of this one.

25:24.967 --> 25:28.767
You should, too.

25:31.533 --> 25:34.067
And what's going
on in here?

25:34.133 --> 25:37.433
Nothing.

25:37.667 --> 25:40.533
The only time you guys are
quiet is when you're asleep,

25:40.600 --> 25:43.567
or when you're trying to
put something over on me.

25:43.633 --> 25:48.767
More homework, less...
whatever was going on here.

25:48.833 --> 25:52.300
I'll be in my office, okay?

25:58.267 --> 26:00.100
In their interviews,
both Oscar and Ella

26:00.167 --> 26:02.100
said they were home alone
at the time of the murder.

26:02.167 --> 26:03.800
Who do you want
to start with?

26:03.867 --> 26:06.433
Oscar, He's the one who
has a problem with Jordan.

26:10.233 --> 26:11.467
You talk to Rachel.

26:11.533 --> 26:12.800
I'll arrange to have
Oscar brought back in.

26:12.867 --> 26:14.600
She'll be flattered you
know her ring tone.

26:14.667 --> 26:15.867
I like her taste
in music.

26:15.933 --> 26:16.967
Well maybe I
picked it out?

26:17.067 --> 26:18.867
I know better.

26:18.933 --> 26:19.867
Hey Rachel.

26:19.933 --> 26:21.200
Everything okay?

26:21.267 --> 26:22.400
Everything's fine.

26:22.467 --> 26:23.833
It's hard to speak
to you privately,

26:23.900 --> 26:25.867
and I wanted to say this now,
if you have a minute.

26:25.933 --> 26:27.333
I do.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.100
So, Mariah.

26:29.167 --> 26:30.667
Yes?

26:30.733 --> 26:33.467
I was thinking you might want to
take her clothes-shopping soon.

26:33.533 --> 26:35.700
Any particular reason?

26:35.767 --> 26:37.367
Her clothes...

26:37.433 --> 26:38.733
they just make
her stand out

26:38.800 --> 26:41.067
in all the wrong
ways at school.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.833
I think she'd have an
easier time making friends

26:42.900 --> 26:47.233
if she dressed a little
more... appropriately.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.867
I appreciate you looking
out for your cousin like this.

26:49.933 --> 26:51.700
Yeah, of course.

26:51.767 --> 26:53.700
Why don't you come with us?
You can help us.

26:53.767 --> 26:55.733
I live in jeans
and a blazer.

26:55.800 --> 26:58.833
I don't even know what's in,
what's appropriate.

26:58.900 --> 27:01.367
I'd love to if it helps.

27:01.433 --> 27:02.800
Whatever works
best for everyone.

27:02.867 --> 27:05.433
Okay, great. We'll
have a girl's day.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.567
Okay gotta go.
Talk to you later.

27:07.633 --> 27:08.833
I love you, Mom.

27:08.900 --> 27:12.100
Love you, too.

27:16.900 --> 27:19.867
Thank you for coming back
in to see us, Oscar.

27:19.933 --> 27:21.567
How could I refuse?

27:21.633 --> 27:25.467
You sent a nice car,
a cute little chauffeur.

27:25.533 --> 27:31.533
How long have you been
romantically involved with Ella?

27:32.333 --> 27:34.067
A bit.

27:34.133 --> 27:35.567
Is that why you went
back to the restaurant,

27:35.633 --> 27:36.967
to help her kill Marco?

27:37.067 --> 27:41.700
That lying-

27:41.767 --> 27:43.767
I didn't help her kill Marco.

27:43.833 --> 27:45.067
I stayed in the parking lot.

27:45.067 --> 27:47.067
She went in by herself.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.500
Why didn't you go
in with her?

27:48.567 --> 27:50.600
She said Marco would listen
to her better, one on one.

27:50.667 --> 27:54.800
Listen to her
about what?

27:55.133 --> 27:57.833
We want to open up
a second location.

27:57.900 --> 28:00.067
With her and me
as the managers.

28:00.133 --> 28:02.433
So she went in alone?

28:02.500 --> 28:04.633
And I waited.

28:04.700 --> 28:08.067
What did she say
when she came out?

28:08.067 --> 28:09.700
That she'd
looked for him,

28:09.767 --> 28:11.900
looked everywhere,
but she couldn't find him.

28:11.967 --> 28:13.800
So there was no point hanging
out and we should leave.

28:13.867 --> 28:17.367
What was she carrying?

28:17.433 --> 28:20.467
Nothing, I don't remember.

28:20.533 --> 28:23.167
So you've been framing
Jordan to protect Ella?

28:23.233 --> 28:26.833
I didn't frame Jordan.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.833
I just kept quiet
because I didn't want

28:28.900 --> 28:32.800
to believe Ella
could do that.

28:33.600 --> 28:38.133
Has she said anything
since it happened?

28:38.200 --> 28:40.800
That we're never gonna
see each other again.

28:40.867 --> 28:42.367
Why?

28:42.433 --> 28:45.533
Because I asked her
if she killed him.

28:45.600 --> 28:50.500
So she slugged me
and kicked me out.

28:50.567 --> 28:52.967
You think you know
a woman... feel me?

28:53.067 --> 28:55.467
Absolutely.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.667
And I'll tell you
one more thing.

28:57.733 --> 29:01.733
I'm not taking
the fall for her!

29:05.900 --> 29:07.067
Ella.

29:07.067 --> 29:10.200
Detectives McLean
and Stewart, remember us?

29:10.267 --> 29:12.700
Sure do.

29:12.767 --> 29:14.800
So are you guys going
to start cooking again?

29:14.867 --> 29:16.567
Without Marco?

29:16.633 --> 29:18.200
Can you believe it?

29:18.267 --> 29:20.133
Mitchell talked
somebody into it,

29:20.200 --> 29:22.600
says Marco would've
wanted it.

29:22.667 --> 29:24.867
Now we're booked
solid for the next week.

29:24.933 --> 29:27.167
Morbid curiosity
as a marketing tool.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.367
We gonna need a minute
of your time.

29:29.433 --> 29:30.733
I really can't.

29:30.800 --> 29:34.667
You're really
going to have to.

29:34.733 --> 29:38.333
Especially because of that.

29:38.400 --> 29:42.233
We were wondering
where that was.

29:48.567 --> 29:50.333
I looked for Marco
everywhere.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.400
And yeah I spent
a couple of seconds

29:52.467 --> 29:55.267
poking around on his desk,
but I never saw him.

29:55.333 --> 29:57.100
And I sure as heck
didn't kill him.

29:57.167 --> 29:58.900
What about Oscar?

29:58.967 --> 30:01.267
That worthless piece
of dirt stayed outside,

30:01.333 --> 30:03.800
just like he told you.

30:03.867 --> 30:06.667
Did you see any sign of
anybody else being there?

30:06.733 --> 30:08.233
No, no one at all.

30:08.300 --> 30:12.300
The lights were on,
but it was so quiet.

30:12.367 --> 30:16.967
Which was kinda creepy, because
Marco usually had the radio-

30:18.233 --> 30:20.367
Was he already dead?

30:20.433 --> 30:24.967
Was he in the walk-in
when I was there?

30:25.033 --> 30:26.833
I'm gonna throw up.

30:26.900 --> 30:28.967
Not on the
evidence, please.

30:29.033 --> 30:30.467
How is that evidence?

30:30.533 --> 30:32.033
Why was it
in your car?

30:32.100 --> 30:34.567
Because Marco paid me
extra to drive him.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.133
Sorta his personal taxi.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.433
Drive him where?

30:37.500 --> 30:39.500
Wherever.

30:39.567 --> 30:41.667
Marco went away for
vehicular manslaughter,

30:41.733 --> 30:44.267
and he said he'd never
get behind the wheel again.

30:44.333 --> 30:46.467
And I was happy to
have the extra cash.

30:46.533 --> 30:48.233
Why wouldn't you ask him
about the second restaurant

30:48.300 --> 30:50.033
when you were
in the car?

30:50.100 --> 30:52.067
Because I thought Oscar and I
should talk to him together,

30:52.133 --> 30:54.233
since we were gonna
run it together.

30:54.300 --> 30:58.000
But that was before I
knew Oscar would wuss out.

30:58.500 --> 31:02.067
So you went back
after closing?

31:02.067 --> 31:04.467
Yeah, everybody knew he
was there super late,

31:04.533 --> 31:08.133
doing paperwork,
trying new recipes.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.167
That's why it was so
creepy I didn't see him.

31:11.233 --> 31:14.433
Did you drive him
anywhere regularly?

31:14.500 --> 31:20.167
Yeah... his gym...
the market.

31:20.233 --> 31:22.733
The intersection
of Lakeview and 24th.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.833
The intersection?
Not a specific address?

31:25.900 --> 31:28.767
Yeah, he told me
to just drop him off.

31:28.833 --> 31:30.600
I never watched
where he went.

31:30.667 --> 31:33.133
There's a church, I figured
he's going to an AA meeting

31:33.200 --> 31:37.567
and that's none
of my business.

31:46.867 --> 31:50.967
Dad, I need to
say something.

31:51.067 --> 31:52.333
You don't need to
apologize, Jeff.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.067
I wasn't going to.

31:54.133 --> 31:55.800
I was going to say
that this whole thing

31:55.867 --> 31:57.933
with Mariah and
Cameron sucks.

31:58.067 --> 32:00.533
You are entitled
to that opinion.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.067
But you are not entitled
to break the rules

32:02.100 --> 32:04.200
while holding that opinion.

32:04.267 --> 32:05.700
It's going to take
some time, buddy.

32:05.767 --> 32:07.667
Just hang in there with us
while we figure it out.

32:07.733 --> 32:09.567
I can't believe you like
having them here either.

32:09.633 --> 32:12.700
I like family doing
the right thing.

32:12.767 --> 32:16.533
So please, get on board
this crazy train.

32:16.600 --> 32:22.200
Okay, but instead of cramming
new beds into our bedrooms,

32:22.267 --> 32:24.067
why don't you build
an apartment

32:24.100 --> 32:25.400
for Mariah and Cameron
in the attic?

32:25.467 --> 32:27.167
Give me a break, would you?

32:27.233 --> 32:31.400
Leave worrying about your
cousins to your mom and me.

32:38.100 --> 32:40.467
Since the church at 24th
and Lakeview

32:40.533 --> 32:44.700
doesn't have AA meetings, is he
getting his nails done?

32:44.767 --> 32:47.500
That's a long way
to go for frozen yogurt.

32:47.567 --> 32:51.967
Pacific Crest
Community College?

32:52.067 --> 32:55.433
Could Marco have had
business there?

32:56.633 --> 33:00.067
It broke my heart when
I heard the news.

33:00.100 --> 33:03.367
Marco was a
wonderful student.

33:03.433 --> 33:05.933
Very focused.

33:06.067 --> 33:10.067
What class was he
taking from you?

33:10.067 --> 33:13.233
The Basic Principles of
Business Management.

33:13.300 --> 33:17.900
Tell you the truth, I think
he was a little embarrassed.

33:17.967 --> 33:20.100
A successful man still
learning how to run things?

33:20.167 --> 33:22.767
Exactly.

33:22.833 --> 33:25.533
But he was very
eager to learn.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.667
He would bring me these
complex questions

33:27.733 --> 33:30.067
and we'd talk
them through,

33:30.133 --> 33:33.800
he'd be scribbling
notes the entire time.

33:33.867 --> 33:37.533
Was there a particular
problem that stands out?

33:37.600 --> 33:43.533
Sure, he had a theoretical
question about cash management.

33:43.600 --> 33:47.700
He'd even constructed a very
realistic model so we could

33:47.767 --> 33:52.933
discuss cash flow, credit and
discounts, the whole thing.

33:53.067 --> 33:56.800
And there was a problem?

33:56.867 --> 33:58.433
I told him he had
created a model

33:58.500 --> 34:02.167
that showed someone was
skimming from the business.

34:02.233 --> 34:05.600
He became upset, angry.

34:05.667 --> 34:08.133
When did you have
this conversation?

34:08.200 --> 34:12.333
Three days ago.

34:15.767 --> 34:17.067
Listen up!

34:17.133 --> 34:18.700
Tonight we set the record
for the most dinners

34:18.767 --> 34:20.433
served in one night.

34:20.500 --> 34:23.300
So a toast to Marco.

34:23.367 --> 34:25.333
To Marco!

34:25.400 --> 34:26.767
Detectives.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.200
We just closed
the restaurant,

34:28.267 --> 34:29.933
but we can pull something
together if you'd like.

34:30.067 --> 34:33.367
That's not why
we're here, Oscar.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.933
Do you have news?

34:36.067 --> 34:37.533
We do.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.367
But it looks like
you're headed out.

34:39.433 --> 34:41.800
I need to go to the bank.

34:41.867 --> 34:44.133
All this cash, it makes me
nervous, especially since...

34:44.200 --> 34:45.867
You should stay.

34:45.933 --> 34:49.633
We've got news you're
going to want to hear.

34:49.700 --> 34:56.067
Okay, let me take care of
this and I'll come right back.

34:56.333 --> 34:58.433
Oscar, why don't you make
profiteroles,

34:58.500 --> 35:00.167
and then we can talk
when I get back.

35:00.233 --> 35:01.533
Why don't I take your
jacket, Mitchell?

35:01.600 --> 35:02.800
And Devin can take your
backpack.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.167
No!

35:10.400 --> 35:12.933
Why isn't that money
in the bank bag?

35:13.067 --> 35:14.667
Mitchell!

35:14.733 --> 35:19.400
You're stealing from us?
From Marco?

35:19.467 --> 35:23.267
You killed Marco didn't you?
You miserable...

35:23.333 --> 35:24.667
No, I can explain.

35:24.733 --> 35:26.300
You have the right
to remain silent.

35:26.367 --> 35:30.767
Or do you want me to just
leave you with them?

35:33.467 --> 35:35.500
You don't understand!

35:35.567 --> 35:37.467
Which part, Mitchell?

35:37.533 --> 35:39.933
That you were stealing from a
man that gave you a future?

35:40.067 --> 35:41.733
That you killed him
when he caught you?

35:41.800 --> 35:45.400
Or that you tried to frame a kid
who was trying to start again?

35:45.467 --> 35:47.133
I keep telling you,
that's not what happened.

35:47.200 --> 35:51.500
You decided you were so
much smarter than your boss.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.433
But you showed him,
didn't you?

35:53.500 --> 35:54.733
You walked out of
his restaurant,

35:54.800 --> 35:57.133
with his money,
right under his nose.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.467
I believe in
the restaurant.

35:58.533 --> 36:00.267
Of course you do.

36:00.333 --> 36:03.500
Because you do all the
hard work, don't you?

36:03.567 --> 36:05.167
You keep everything
running, pay all the bills,

36:05.233 --> 36:07.067
and you get none
of the glory.

36:07.133 --> 36:08.567
You weren't skimming,

36:08.633 --> 36:09.900
you were just paying
yourself a little bonus.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.167
No.

36:11.233 --> 36:13.133
And then Marco
started taking classes,

36:13.200 --> 36:15.867
and he got smart,
and he figured it out.

36:15.933 --> 36:19.433
And then all your hard work
and all of your smarts,

36:19.500 --> 36:21.667
none of it mattered.

36:21.733 --> 36:25.600
Yes!

36:27.067 --> 36:31.533
I tried to explain!
He wouldn't listen.

36:31.600 --> 36:39.067
I told him I'd make it right,
but he kept screaming at me.

36:39.067 --> 36:43.400
And I yelled back and...

36:48.367 --> 36:54.067
It was just a mess.

36:54.100 --> 36:58.067
He was always so proud
of his spotless kitchen.

36:58.133 --> 37:03.067
So I made sure
I cleaned up.

37:03.133 --> 37:08.667
What did you do with the pan?
And the cloths?

37:10.567 --> 37:16.733
I threw them in the river.

37:19.667 --> 37:23.867
I learned that
in prison, too.

38:12.133 --> 38:14.367
Who is that?

38:14.433 --> 38:16.667
"Unknown Caller."

38:16.733 --> 38:19.767
Wrong number?

38:19.833 --> 38:24.967
Hi you've reached Mariah,
please leave a message...

38:44.400 --> 38:46.200
Definitely.

38:46.267 --> 38:50.400
You too?
That's weird.

38:50.467 --> 38:53.700
Probably some robo
sales call.

38:53.767 --> 38:56.867
If it's anyone important,
they'll leave a message.

38:56.933 --> 39:01.167
This is Cameron,
ell me what I need to know.T

39:18.400 --> 39:20.300
We should go shopping
this weekend, just us girls.

39:20.367 --> 39:22.467
Yeah sounds great, Mom.

39:22.533 --> 39:28.067
Thank you...
Aunt Allison.

39:28.133 --> 39:32.367
This is cedar-plank salmon,
a specialty at Prison Food.

39:32.433 --> 39:35.067
We make our marinade with
brown sugar and garlic.

39:35.133 --> 39:37.467
And there's braised asparagus,
fingerling potatoes,

39:37.533 --> 39:40.567
and a kale salad with a
champagne vinaigrette.

39:40.633 --> 39:43.133
Wow.

39:48.567 --> 39:50.367
Don't worry Jeff,
I don't bite.

39:50.433 --> 39:52.267
I don't mean...

39:52.333 --> 39:53.733
I don't know.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.300
Better get used to
eating with ex-cons.

39:55.367 --> 39:57.433
Cameron!

39:57.500 --> 40:00.767
Your aunt told me about
your dad, and I'm sorry.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.467
That's a deep pain.

40:02.533 --> 40:05.367
But what makes the difference
in getting out and staying out

40:05.433 --> 40:07.067
is knowing there
will be people

40:07.133 --> 40:10.267
who will stand with
you when you do.

40:10.333 --> 40:14.067
All of you are lucky to have
someone like Detective...

40:14.133 --> 40:17.633
Allison, to do
that for you.

40:17.700 --> 40:21.200
Thanks, Jordan.

40:21.267 --> 40:23.267
This meal looks
tremendous, Jordan.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.400
Thank you so much.

40:24.467 --> 40:26.000
It's my pleasure.

40:26.067 --> 40:28.067
The best way I could think of
to say thank you to your wife.

40:28.133 --> 40:29.400
I told him it
wasn't necessary,

40:29.467 --> 40:32.333
but then he started
describing this salmon.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.533
And that was that.

40:39.800 --> 40:40.967
I don't decide
what I liked better.

40:41.033 --> 40:42.667
The salmon, or the
fact that Jordan

40:42.733 --> 40:46.267
insisted on doing
the dishes.

40:46.333 --> 40:48.633
Think they can keep
the restaurant going?

40:48.700 --> 40:50.833
Yeah, I think Ella,
Jordan, and Oscar

40:50.900 --> 40:52.967
are going to try
to run it together.

40:53.033 --> 40:54.367
I think they'll
do a good job.

40:54.433 --> 40:57.700
Hope they get a
better accountant.

40:57.767 --> 41:00.467
We'll make sure to
go by and check on them.

41:00.533 --> 41:04.600
And monitor the quality
of the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.

41:04.667 --> 41:08.867
I think the blowtorch was Jeff's
favorite part of the meal.

41:08.933 --> 41:11.300
How's he doing?

41:11.367 --> 41:13.900
He had his first
detention today,

41:13.967 --> 41:16.667
didn't want to discuss it.

41:16.733 --> 41:21.067
You know, he's angry
about a lot of stuff.

41:21.067 --> 41:23.767
So is Cameron.

41:23.833 --> 41:29.167
I think it's going to take
a lot of work and time

41:29.233 --> 41:31.233
to settle us all
in together.

41:31.300 --> 41:34.100
At least the girls
are doing better.

41:34.167 --> 41:38.700
Oh, you sweet, sweet
optimistic man.

41:38.767 --> 41:39.900
Really?

41:39.967 --> 41:43.433
Really.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.233
It's impressive, you know?

41:51.300 --> 41:55.767
That you never give
up on anybody.

41:55.833 --> 42:01.100
I just want everyone to
be happy and feel safe.

42:01.167 --> 42:02.800
All four of them.

42:02.867 --> 42:04.733
They will.

42:04.800 --> 42:08.167
As soon as we
buy a new car.

42:08.233 --> 42:11.367
And build some beds and...

42:11.433 --> 42:12.600
Enough of that.

42:12.667 --> 42:16.833
Give me a little
sugar, come on.
