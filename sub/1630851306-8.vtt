WEBVTT

00:07.247 --> 00:11.217
>>> IT WILL BE THE WORK OF THE
NEXT PRESIDENT TO RESTORE THE

00:11.317 --> 00:13.686
PROMISE OF AMERICA.
WE WILL NOT ONLY BUILD BACK, WE

00:13.787 --> 00:18.924
WILL BUILD BACK BETTER.
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

00:19.024 --> 00:21.659
>> JOE BIDEN HAS BIG IDEAS, BIG
PLANS FOR THE COUNTRY IF HE WINS

00:21.759 --> 00:22.893
THE ELECTION.

00:22.994 --> 00:29.198
>> JOE IS GOING TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE HAVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL

00:29.299 --> 00:29.732
WORK.

00:30.065 --> 00:31.167
>> WE'LL RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE.

00:31.266 --> 00:36.738
>> WE'RE GOING TO CANCEL A BIG
CHUNK OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.640
>> JOE AND KAMALA WILL PROTECT
YOUR HEALTH CARE BECAUSE JOE

00:38.739 --> 00:46.613
UNDERSTANDS THAT A PRESIDENT'S
FIRST JOB IS TO KEEP US SAFE.

00:46.712 --> 00:52.183
>> NOW IS WHEN THE REAL WORK
BEGINS, TO SAVE LIVES AND BEAT

00:52.283 --> 00:55.253
THIS EPIDEMIC.
TO REBUILD OUR ECONOMY.

00:55.352 --> 00:58.655
>> AND ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:58.754 --> 01:03.025
TO SAVE OUR PLANET BY GETTING
CLIMATE UNDER CONTROL.

01:03.125 --> 01:06.495
AND NOW THE WORK OF MAKING THAT
VISION IS REAL.

01:06.595 --> 01:11.232
WE CAN DO IT.
I KNOW WE CAN.

01:11.331 --> 01:15.134
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN'S $1.9
TRILLION COVID RELIEF PACKAGE.

01:15.235 --> 01:19.170
IT'S THE FIRST REAL LEGISLATIVE
TEST FOR THE NEW BIDEN

01:19.271 --> 01:20.039
ADMINISTRATION.

01:20.438 --> 01:25.710
>> IT HAS NO CONGRESSIONAL
REPUBLICANS SUPPORTING IT SO

01:25.810 --> 01:26.210
FAR.

01:27.043 --> 01:28.811
>> WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT
TOGETHER REALLY IS A LIBERAL

01:28.912 --> 01:30.114
WISH LIST.

01:30.213 --> 01:33.516
>> BIDEN IS FACING A DIFFICULT
ROAD AHEAD.

01:33.616 --> 01:36.817
HE CANNOT LOSE A SINGLE DEMOCRAT
ON THIS PACKAGE.

01:36.918 --> 01:38.052
THAT IS TOUGH.

01:38.152 --> 01:42.924
>> WE HAVE A 50/50 PROBLEM.
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE ANY

01:43.024 --> 01:44.125
SENATOR CAN STOP THE TRAIN.

01:44.224 --> 01:47.060
>> NEW FAULT LINES ARE BEING
DRAWN OUT BETWEEN PROGRESSIVES

01:47.159 --> 01:48.460
AND MODERATES ON KEY POLICIES.

01:48.561 --> 01:52.397
>> A LOT OF REPUBLICAN
COUNTERPARTS SITTING BACK AND

01:52.497 --> 01:55.066
LETTING DEMOCRATS SORT OF FIGHT
OVER THE MINIMUM WAGE PACKAGE

01:55.165 --> 01:58.902
THAT WOULD BE A PART OF THE
BILL.

01:59.003 --> 02:01.572
>> HE HAS TO UNIFY HIS OWN
PARTY.

02:01.671 --> 02:07.209
>> HE'S GOING TO NOT JUST SET
THE TONE, BUT TELL THE STORY OF

02:07.310 --> 02:10.345
POTENTIALLY THIS ADMINISTRATION.

02:10.444 --> 02:15.983
>> CRITICS SAY MY PLAN IS TOO
BIG.

02:16.082 --> 02:18.851
LET ME ASK THEM, WHAT WOULD THEY
HAVE ME CUT?

02:18.951 --> 02:19.852
WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE ME LEAVE
OUT?

02:19.953 --> 02:23.188
THIS IS UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, FOR GOD SAKE.

02:57.048 --> 03:02.620
>> WOW.
THIS IS A LOT OF SNOW.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.754
I'M DRINKING BEER IN A PUP TENT.

03:04.854 --> 03:06.121
>> BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET ENOUGH
COLD IN MINNESOTA?

03:06.222 --> 03:11.492
>> I'M SO TIRED OF WEARING --
I'VE TURNED INTO A CANADIAN

03:11.592 --> 03:12.060
GOOSE.

03:12.828 --> 03:15.063
>> TEXTING A PICTURE OF YOU GUYS
OF WHAT'S NOW ON MY TABLE.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.496
>> OH, MY GOD.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.032
>> TWO PEA ZAS IS BOLD.

03:18.132 --> 03:21.334
>> JOHN, HAVE YOU EATEN PIZZA
FOR THE LAST FOUR WEEKS?

03:21.433 --> 03:24.938
>> YEAH, THAT'S ALL I DO IS EAT
PIZZA.

03:25.037 --> 03:29.474
>> I'M JUST GOING AROUND A PIZZA
PARLOURS.

03:29.574 --> 03:31.808
>> NORMALLY THE FIRST COUPLE
WEEKS OF A NEW ADMINISTRATION

03:31.908 --> 03:36.346
IT'S LIKE HERE IS THE NEW TEAM,
MEET THE NEW BOSS.

03:36.445 --> 03:37.014
YOU KNOW.

03:37.647 --> 03:39.216
>> A NEW ADMINISTRATION JUST THE
CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE.

03:39.314 --> 03:43.085
>> BUT WITH EVERYBODY FOCUSED
ON, YOU KNOW, THE INSURRECTION,

03:43.185 --> 03:46.253
THE FALLOUT FROM THE
INSURRECTION, THE IMPEACHMENT

03:46.354 --> 03:48.289
TRIAL.
BIDEN LIKE HAS BEEN, YOU KNOW,

03:48.390 --> 03:51.558
OFF STAGE IN SOME WAYS.
IRONICALLY I THINK THAT THE

03:51.659 --> 03:52.825
IMPEACHMENT STUFF KIND OF HELPED
HIM.

03:52.926 --> 03:55.193
EVERYBODY WAS SAYING THAT THAT
WAS GOING TO BE A DISTRACTION, I

03:55.294 --> 03:57.996
THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF
COVER FOR THEM TO GO MAKE A

03:58.097 --> 04:00.198
BUNCH OF THE SAUSAGE WITHOUT A
BUNCH OF PEOPLE WATCHING, RIGHT?

04:00.297 --> 04:03.099
>> IT WAS A DISTRACTION FOR THE
REPUBLICANS, NOT FOR BIDEN.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.835
>> YEAH, MOST IMPORTANT THING
FOR BIDEN IS THE COVID PACKAGE

04:05.936 --> 04:10.272
AND IT'S LOOKING LIKE IT'S GOING
TO BE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE AND A

04:10.373 --> 04:13.609
PRETTY GOOD CHANCE TO PASS IT BY
MARCH WHICH WAS THEIR BIG GOAL

04:13.708 --> 04:14.943
OF THE FIRST 100 DAYS.

04:15.044 --> 04:18.979
>> TO BREAK DOWN WHAT IS IN THAT
$1.9 TRILLION BILL IT'S A

04:19.080 --> 04:22.381
TRILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT
STIMULUS, $15 MINIMUM WAGE AND

04:22.482 --> 04:25.652
IT'S $170 BILLION FOR SCHOOL
REOPENING.

04:25.751 --> 04:30.690
$1.9 TRILLION SOUNDS LIKE A TON
OF MONEY, SOMETHING THAT THE

04:30.789 --> 04:33.758
PUBLIC MIGHT BALK AT EXCEPT
BIDEN AND HIS TEAM SAID, OKAY,

04:33.857 --> 04:36.359
WE HAVE TO TALK TO REAL PEOPLE,
BE ON TELEVISION.

04:36.460 --> 04:38.162
>> NOW IS THE TIME TO GO BIG.

04:38.261 --> 04:40.996
>> HE'S PUT FORWARD A BIG, BOLD
PACKAGE.

04:41.097 --> 04:41.931
>> BIG AND BOLD.

04:42.030 --> 04:42.498
>> BIG.

04:42.597 --> 04:42.864
>> BIG.

04:42.965 --> 04:43.532
>> BOLD.

04:43.633 --> 04:43.866
>> BOLD.

04:43.965 --> 04:44.767
>> BOLD.

04:44.866 --> 04:46.868
>> BIG, BOLD PACKAGE, SOME SAY
VERY BIG.

04:46.967 --> 04:49.871
I AGREE WITH THAT.
THAT'S WHY MORE THAN SEVEN IN

04:49.970 --> 04:52.873
TEN AMERICANS ACTUALLY SUPPORT
THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE IN THAT

04:52.972 --> 04:54.607
PACKAGE.
BUT BIDEN HAS A REAL

04:54.708 --> 04:57.042
VULNERABILITY IN TERMS OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

04:57.143 --> 05:00.546
IT'S JUST A REALLY BIG TENT
PARTY RIGHT NOW.

05:00.645 --> 05:03.916
IT'S A CAUCUS THAT HAS TO MAKE
ROOM FOR MODERATES ON ONE SIDE

05:04.015 --> 05:05.917
AND PROGRESSIVES ON THE OTHER.

05:06.017 --> 05:08.852
>> EVERYBODY KNEW THAT IN A
50/50 SENATE MODERATES WERE

05:08.953 --> 05:12.955
GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF POWER.
JOE MANCHIN AND KYRSTEN SINEMA

05:13.056 --> 05:14.789
SAY THEY ARE NOT FOR THE MINIMUM
WAGE INCREASE.

05:14.890 --> 05:17.225
>> BUT THE PROGRESSIVE WING OF
THE PARTY REALLY WANTS THIS AND

05:17.325 --> 05:18.460
THINKS IT'S THE TIME TO DO IT.

05:18.561 --> 05:22.196
>> THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A
COUNTDOWN CLOCK ON HOW LONG IT'S

05:22.296 --> 05:24.931
GOING TO TAKE BEFORE WE START TO
HEAR FROM BERNIE AND WARREN AND

05:25.032 --> 05:26.133
OTHER PROGRESSIVES.

05:26.232 --> 05:29.301
>> IT FEELS LIKE THE FIRST BIG
TEST FOR THE BIG TENT PARTY,

05:29.402 --> 05:30.068
RIGHT?

05:30.169 --> 05:31.337
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

05:31.436 --> 05:34.371
>> THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE TO
$15 IS GOING TO BE -- IT GOING

05:34.472 --> 05:37.876
TO BE TOUGH TO DO, BUT IT'S VERY
TELLING TO ME ABOUT BIDEN'S

05:37.974 --> 05:40.143
STRATEGY.
THEY'RE WILLING TO GET CAUGHT

05:40.244 --> 05:41.277
TRYING AND GOING REALLY BIG.

05:41.378 --> 05:44.914
>> YOU KNOW, THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION WHAT THEY HAVEN'T

05:45.013 --> 05:46.448
DONE YET REALLY IS SORT OF -- IS
REALLY SCORE AND IT FEELS LIKE

05:46.549 --> 05:48.984
THIS IS THE WEEK WHEN THEY
FINALLY START TO PUT SOME POINTS

05:49.083 --> 05:50.284
ON THE BOARD.

05:50.385 --> 05:52.652
>> THE DEMOCRATS COULD COME OUT
OF THIS WEEK AND SAY NOT ONLY DO

05:52.753 --> 05:58.624
WE HAVE POINTS ON THE BOARD, WE
HAVE 1.9 TRILLION POINTS ON THE

05:58.724 --> 06:02.628
BOARD. BOARD.

06:02.727 --> 06:06.765
>> $1.9 TRILLION COVID RELIEF
PACKAGE GETS ITS FIRST REAL TEST

06:06.864 --> 06:11.467
FRIDAY WITH A VOTE SCHEDULED IN
THE HOUSE.

06:11.568 --> 06:14.905
INCLUDE SD A PROVISION TO HIKE
THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $15 AN HOUR.

06:15.004 --> 06:18.039
>> EVEN THOUGH PRICES OF YOUR
DRINKS AND YOUR MEALS HAVE GONE

06:18.140 --> 06:22.943
UP, OUR WAGES HAVE NOT.
WE DESERVE THE FAIR MINIMUM

06:23.044 --> 06:23.477
WAGE.

06:24.311 --> 06:26.113
>> WE ARE COMING OUT HERE, WE
ARE FIGHTING FOR A $15 MINIMUM

06:26.212 --> 06:29.249
WAGE FOR EVERY WORKER ACROSS
THIS COUNTRY.

06:29.349 --> 06:31.917
>> PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS ARE
SAYING IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT IT

06:32.018 --> 06:34.686
BE A PART OF THE COVID RELIEF
PACKAGE.

06:34.787 --> 06:38.457
>> I WAS HIRED AS A FOOD SERVER,
I WORKED 40 HOURS PER WEEK AND

06:38.556 --> 06:43.126
ONLY MADE $300 A CHECK.
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A LIVABLE

06:43.227 --> 06:44.128
WAGE?

06:44.494 --> 06:47.964
>> YOU SAY TO DEMOCRATS IF YOU
TURN BACK ON THIS YOU WILL BE

06:48.063 --> 06:54.969
ABANDONING THE VERY PEOPLE THAT
VOTED FOR YOU.

06:55.068 --> 06:58.806
>> THE PRESIDENT IS REALLY
THINKING ABOUT THIS IS A MOMENT

06:58.905 --> 07:06.179
WHERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
REDEFINE THE ECONOMY FOR WORKING

07:06.278 --> 07:08.280
PEOPLE.
HE IS UNEQUIVOCALLY COMMITTED TO

07:08.379 --> 07:10.582
GETTING THE MINIMUM WAGE RAISED
TO $15.

07:10.681 --> 07:14.551
THE PRESIDENT PUT IT IN THE
PACKAGE BECAUSE HE FIRMLY

07:14.652 --> 07:18.121
BELIEVES THAT NOBODY IN THIS
COUNTRY SHOULD WORK A FULL WEEK

07:18.220 --> 07:25.828
AND LIVE IN POVERTY.

07:25.927 --> 07:29.597
>> YOU ALL DID NOT HAVE THE
NORMAL HONEYMOON PERIOD AND

07:29.696 --> 07:32.364
THERE WAS LIKE A LOT OF TALK,
OH, MY GOD, THE BIDEN WHITE

07:32.465 --> 07:35.869
HOUSE IS REALLY GETTING OFF ON A
TOUGH FOOTING BECAUSE THE

07:35.969 --> 07:39.505
CONGRESS IS GOING TO BE
DISTRACTED BY TRUMP.

07:39.604 --> 07:43.041
>> I THINK WE FOCUSED ON WHAT
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE LOOKING

07:43.140 --> 07:46.044
FOR, WHICH WAS A PRESIDENT TO
STEP UP AND SAY, I'M GOING TO

07:46.143 --> 07:49.378
PUT FORWARD A PLAN TO CRUSH THIS
VIRUS, AND I'M GOING TO PUT

07:49.479 --> 07:51.580
FORWARD A PLAN TO GET THE
ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK.

07:51.681 --> 07:54.417
>> WE'RE GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF
TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE

07:54.517 --> 07:56.585
PACKAGE IS GOING TO DO.
SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS

07:56.684 --> 07:57.619
MEANS FOR THEM.

07:57.953 --> 08:00.921
>> SO I KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT.
THAT'S A LESSON FROM OBAMA.

08:01.020 --> 08:04.557
>> I THINK HISTORY HAS SHOWN
THAT YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE

08:04.657 --> 08:05.892
ENOUGH.
THEY HAVE A LOT GOING ON IN

08:05.992 --> 08:06.593
THEIR LIVES.

08:06.692 --> 08:08.862
>> RIGHT.

08:08.961 --> 08:12.763
>> THE FIRST RULE OF OBAMA, ACA,
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PASSED BY

08:12.864 --> 08:16.667
2010 AND IT SEEMED LIKE THE BIG
PROBLEM FOR US WAS NONE OF THE

08:16.767 --> 08:19.269
BENEFITS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT WERE REALLY FELT, SEEN,

08:19.369 --> 08:20.302
UNDERSTOOD BY THE PUBLIC.

08:20.402 --> 08:21.204
>> EXACTLY.

08:21.638 --> 08:23.172
>> I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER
THE LAST MONTH IS THE MORE

08:23.272 --> 08:25.840
PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT THE RESCUE
PLAN THE MORE THEY LIKE IT.

08:25.941 --> 08:29.277
AND SO FOR US IT'S GOING TO BE
APPLYING THE SAME KIND OF

08:29.377 --> 08:32.880
COMMUNICATION STRATEGY THAT
WE'RE APPLYING TO TRY TO GET THE

08:32.980 --> 08:37.149
BILL PASSED TO THEN, YOU KNOW,
AFTER THE BILL PASSES,

08:37.250 --> 08:39.484
HOPEFULLY, TO HELP PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND HOW IS IT GOING TO

08:39.585 --> 08:44.022
HELP THEM IN THEIR LIVES.
WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC

08:44.122 --> 08:46.892
IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU GET
VOTES FROM THE HILL FOR

08:46.992 --> 08:48.524
REPUBLICANS, IT'S WHETHER OR NOT
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE AN

08:48.625 --> 08:51.195
EFFECTIVE CRITIQUE AGAINST WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

08:51.295 --> 08:52.495
>> YEAH.

08:52.595 --> 08:55.498
>> WELL, WE HAVE PUT FORWARD THE
PLAN THAT REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS,

08:55.598 --> 08:58.767
REPUBLICAN MAYORS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY HAVE SAID THEY NEED,

08:58.867 --> 09:01.603
THAT THEY SUPPORT.
50% OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS

09:01.702 --> 09:04.037
SURVEYED IN THE COUNTRY SUPPORT
THE PACKAGE.

09:04.138 --> 09:08.240
IT'S REALLY ONLY REPUBLICANS ON
CAPITOL HILL WHO ARE OPPOSING

09:08.340 --> 09:10.744
THE PLAN.
TO PUT A FINE POINT ON T IF YOU

09:10.844 --> 09:13.778
ARE VOTING AGAINST THE PACKAGE
YOU ARE VOTING AGAINST THE PLAN

09:13.878 --> 09:16.681
TO FIGHT COVID AND I THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO HOME

09:16.781 --> 09:20.250
TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND THEY
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY

09:20.350 --> 09:22.451
THEY VOTED AGAINST DIRECT
CHECKS, WHY THEY VOTED AGAINST

09:22.551 --> 09:24.988
MONEY FOR VACCINES, WHY THEY
VOTED AGAINST MONEY TO GET

09:25.088 --> 09:28.157
SCHOOLS OPEN, AND THE QUESTION
FOR REPUBLICANS IN WASHINGTON IS

09:28.257 --> 09:31.026
ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO YOUR
CONSTITUENTS OR NOT?

09:31.125 --> 09:34.061
AND I THINK IF THEY DON'T, THERE
IS GOING TO BE A PRICE FOR THEM

09:34.162 --> 09:40.532
TO PAY.
I REALLY DO.

09:40.633 --> 09:42.734
>> THERE IS SORT OF A FALSE
NARRATIVE GOING ON THAT THIS IS

09:42.835 --> 09:45.202
AN EMERGENCY RELIEF BILL.
WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF MANUAL

09:45.303 --> 09:49.340
RELIEF BILLS ALREADY.
WE HAD A MASSIVE ONE, ABOUT $900

09:49.441 --> 09:52.075
BILLION WORTH IN DECEMBER.
THAT WAS A BIPARTISAN RELIEF

09:52.176 --> 09:57.213
BILL, THIS ONE IS VERY MUCH NOT.
SEEMS MORE LIKELY THAT THE

09:57.314 --> 10:03.085
DEMOCRATS WANT SOMETHING THAT
BIDEN CAN SIGN.

10:04.518 --> 10:09.089
>> THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY THAT
HAS NOT BEEN SPENT FOR

10:09.189 --> 10:10.691
DISBURSED, IT'S HARD TO GET
EXACT NUMBERS BALLS THE

10:10.791 --> 10:14.192
ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT GIVE IT
TO US, IT'S EITHER BECAUSE THEY

10:14.292 --> 10:16.595
REFUSE TO OR BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY
DON'T KNOW.

10:16.695 --> 10:19.830
SO HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY SPENDING
$1.9 TRILLION WHEN YOU'RE NOT

10:19.931 --> 10:22.032
EVEN SURE WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY
SPENT?

10:22.133 --> 10:26.235
>> WHAT THE BIDEN TEAM WOULD SAY
IN RESPONSE TO THAT IS WE DON'T

10:26.336 --> 10:29.004
HAVE MONTHS TO FIND OUT WHERE
EVERY NICKEL WENT, IT'S A CRISIS

10:29.104 --> 10:31.941
AND WE LEARN FROM THE ECONOMIC
CRISIS THAT WAITING TOO LONG AND

10:32.041 --> 10:35.944
DOING TOO LITTLE IS A BIGGER
PROBLEM THAN DOING TOO MUCH TOO

10:36.043 --> 10:36.478
FAST.

10:36.912 --> 10:38.311
>> YEAH.
AND HIS WORDS EXACTLY WERE,

10:38.412 --> 10:41.282
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU TAKE OUT.

10:41.382 --> 10:41.915
>> YEAH.

10:42.349 --> 10:44.651
>> WE HAVE A LONG LIST OF
THINGS, IN FACT.

10:44.750 --> 10:50.756
UNNECESSARY -- AND THE FORMULA
FOR THAT OVERWHELMINGLY BENEFITS

10:50.855 --> 10:52.356
BLUE STATES.
JUST IMAGINE THAT.

10:52.456 --> 10:55.426
OR STATES ESPECIALLY THAT
IMPLEMENTED LOCKDOWNS,

10:55.526 --> 10:56.460
ESPECIALLY HARD.

10:56.726 --> 10:58.461
>> IT MAY HAVE BEEN STATES THAT
SUFFERED THE WORST, TOO.

10:58.561 --> 11:01.229
>> WELL, EVERYBODY SUFFERED THE
WORST, IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

11:01.330 --> 11:04.633
JUST COVID.
NOW, THERE'S -- NOW, THERE'S

11:04.734 --> 11:07.067
SELF-IMPOSED SUFFERING AS WELL,
WHICH IS IN THE FORM OF

11:07.167 --> 11:08.737
LOCKDOWNS.
HERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM, IF YOU

11:08.836 --> 11:10.470
ARE GOING TO GIVE ADDITIONAL
MONEY TO THE SCHOOLS YOU HAVE TO

11:10.570 --> 11:12.973
AT LEAST SAY, LOOK, HAVE A
REOPENING PLAN.

11:13.072 --> 11:15.907
GIVE AMERICANS SOME LIGHT AT THE
END OF THE TUNNEL AND DON'T TALK

11:16.008 --> 11:20.311
TO ME ABOUT CLOSING SCHOOLS AND
HOW THAT'S BETTER FOR OUR KIDS

11:20.412 --> 11:22.881
OR TEACHERS.
THAT'S BEEN DEBUNKED BY SCIENCE.

11:22.980 --> 11:24.514
THE PARTY OF SCIENCE SHOULD
LISTEN TO SCIENCE.

11:24.614 --> 11:26.316
>> THERE IS A PERCEPTION THAT
THIS IS A GOOD THING.

11:26.417 --> 11:30.452
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SUPPORTS IT
BY 75%, REPUBLICANS BY 60%.

11:30.552 --> 11:35.090
SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DEAL
WITH THAT POLITICALLY?

11:35.190 --> 11:37.426
>> I'M NOT THAT WORRIED ABOUT
THIS ONE ONE.

11:37.526 --> 11:42.095
THIS ONE IS EXTREMELY BLOATED.
I EXPLAIN HARD ONES ALL THE TIME

11:42.195 --> 11:43.364
AND I WILL EXPLAIN THIS ONE.

11:43.463 --> 11:45.465
>> YOU DON'T THINK IT WILL BE
HARD TO DEFEND YOUR VOTE AGAINST

11:45.565 --> 11:45.931
IT?

11:46.633 --> 11:48.167
>> NO, I DON'T.
WE HAVE TO AT LEAST PRETEND THAT

11:48.267 --> 11:51.670
ONE OF OUR JOBS IS GOOD
GOVERNANCE AND NOT SADDLING OUR

11:51.771 --> 11:53.671
CHILDREN WITH REALLY
UNSUSTAINABLE AMOUNTS OF DEBT.

11:53.772 --> 11:56.608
>> WELL, DEBT IS SOMETHING THAT
DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE

11:56.708 --> 11:57.341
MUCH ABOUT.

11:57.441 --> 12:00.210
>> NO, HE DIDN'T.
THAT'S TRUE.

12:00.310 --> 12:01.979
IT'S A PROBLEM.

12:02.079 --> 12:04.113
>> SO CPAC IS THIS WEEKEND.

12:04.213 --> 12:05.381
>> UH-HUH.

12:05.480 --> 12:08.483
>> YOU HAD THE NUMBER ONE AND
NUMBER THREE LEADERSHIP OF YOUR

12:08.583 --> 12:15.122
PARTY PUBLICLY DISAGREE ABOUT
THE ROLE OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT

12:15.221 --> 12:16.423
OF THE UNITED STATES.

12:16.523 --> 12:18.858
>> DO YOU THINK FORMER PRESIDENT
TRUMP SHOULD BE SPEAKING AT CPAC

12:18.958 --> 12:19.526
THIS WEEKEND.

12:19.625 --> 12:20.926
>> I SHOULD.

12:21.027 --> 12:24.729
>> I DON'T BELIEVE HE SHOULD BE
PLAYING A ROLE IN THE FUTURE OF

12:24.830 --> 12:25.464
THE PARTY.

12:25.564 --> 12:27.798
>> ON THAT HIGH NOTE --

12:27.898 --> 12:30.100
>> ISN'T THAT PROBLEMATIC FOR
THE PARTY?

12:30.200 --> 12:32.569
>> IT ISN'T IDEAL.

12:32.668 --> 12:36.739
>> I MEAN, THERE ARE REPUBLICANS
WHO, STICK MYSELF IN THAT

12:36.839 --> 12:39.642
BUCKET, THAT JUST SAY I'D LIKE
TO SEE A VIBRANT HEALTHY

12:39.742 --> 12:41.042
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
I THINK IF DONALD TRUMP IS PART

12:41.142 --> 12:45.278
OF THAT EQUATION IN THE FUTURE
IT'S PROBLEMATIC FOR A LOT OF

12:45.378 --> 12:45.878
PEOPLE.

12:46.580 --> 12:49.483
>> I MEAN, THE FUNDAMENTAL
ANSWER IS WHO IS GOING TO LEAD

12:49.583 --> 12:52.851
THE PARTY?
WE DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT.

12:52.951 --> 12:55.353
LIKE RIGHT AWAY.
SO JUST CHILL OUT.

12:55.454 --> 12:59.522
LIKE THAT'S KIND OF MY MESSAGE
TO BOTH EXTREMES OF THIS WHO

12:59.623 --> 13:03.293
KEEP SAYING, NO, BRING HIM BACK
IN, WE NEED HIM, AND THOSE WHO

13:03.393 --> 13:08.598
ARE SAYING, KEEP HIM AWAY, LIKE,
NO, NO, JUST LIKE WHY DON'T YOU

13:08.697 --> 13:10.766
FOCUS ON WHO YOU ARE.
LET'S JUST DO THAT AND I THINK

13:10.865 --> 13:16.637
WE WILL BE OKAY.

13:18.004 --> 13:21.608
>> ALL EYES IN WASHINGTON ARE
NOW ON THE LITTLE KNOWN SENATE

13:21.708 --> 13:26.077
PARLIAMENTARIAN WHO WILL DECIDE
SOON WHETHER BIDEN'S PROPOSED

13:26.177 --> 13:27.513
$15 MINIMUM WAGE CAN BE
INCLUDED.

13:27.613 --> 13:30.681
DEMOCRATS ARE STILL SHARPLY
DIVIDED WITH WHETHER THE WAGE

13:30.782 --> 13:35.119
INCREASE SHOULD BE IN THE BILL
AT ALL.

13:35.219 --> 13:37.220
>> THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE AGE OF
COVID AND THE BIDEN

13:37.320 --> 13:40.156
ADMINISTRATION IS DIFFERENT THAN
ANYTHING THAT'S EVER BEEN

13:40.255 --> 13:42.389
BEFORE.
THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHITE HOUSE

13:42.490 --> 13:44.292
STAFF IS NOT WORKING IN THE
BUILDING.

13:44.392 --> 13:50.364
THEY'RE STILL WORKING FROM HOME.
FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A

13:50.464 --> 13:56.002
HAUNTED HOUSE RIGHT NOW.
AND WHAT NORMALLY WOULD BE A

13:56.101 --> 14:00.205
HIVE OF ACTIVITY, PEOPLE COMING
AND GOING, VISITORS IN AND OUT,

14:00.305 --> 14:03.541
YOU KNOW, HERE GIVES THIS KIND
OF FALSE APPEARANCE THAT NOT

14:03.641 --> 14:09.112
MUCH IS GOING ON WHEN, IN FACT,
A SHIT TON IS GOING ON.

14:09.211 --> 14:14.383
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS, IN A WORD,
ARE WE GOOD?

14:14.483 --> 14:20.620
OKAY.

14:20.720 --> 14:24.923
>> WHAT'S BEEN REMARKABLE TO ME
HAVING SEEN -- I CAN'T EVEN

14:25.023 --> 14:28.094
COUNT HOW MANY TRANSITIONS NOW
FROM THE OUTGOING AND THE

14:28.194 --> 14:32.330
INCOMING, HOW INCREDIBLY
ORGANIZED AND COMPREHENSIVE THE

14:32.430 --> 14:37.734
WORK OF THE TRANSITION TEAM WAS.
WHEN I'VE BEEN STRUCK BY

14:37.835 --> 14:44.306
THROUGHOUT, JOHN, IS THIS IS A
TEAM OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT

14:44.406 --> 14:48.109
THEY'RE DOING.

14:48.210 --> 14:52.546
>> THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A BIG
DISCUSSION GOING ON ABOUT

14:52.647 --> 14:54.681
BIPARTISANSHIP, BUT IT'S TURNING
OUT LIKE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT

14:54.781 --> 14:59.250
WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE THIS BIG
COVID PACKAGE GET DONE WITHOUT

14:59.350 --> 15:00.418
ANY REPUBLICAN VOTES.

15:00.518 --> 15:02.153
>> WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO
PARTICULARLY WITH THE AMERICAN

15:02.253 --> 15:04.756
RESCUE PLAN AS THE FIRST MAJOR
PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS DELIVER

15:04.855 --> 15:09.058
THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED, DEALING
WITH EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT

15:09.158 --> 15:12.360
BENEFITS, STUDENT LOAN PAUSES,
YOU KNOW, REDUCING CHILD

15:12.460 --> 15:14.095
POVERTY.
I MEAN, THERE'S SO MANY ELEMENTS

15:14.196 --> 15:18.233
IN THIS PACKAGE THAT
MEANINGFULLY WILL DELIVER FOR

15:18.333 --> 15:22.769
REGULAR PEOPLE AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON A

15:22.869 --> 15:24.738
BIPARTISAN BASIS GET THAT THIS
IS A GOOD PACKAGE.

15:24.838 --> 15:29.609
MORE THAN 70% OF AMERICANS IN
VIRTUALLY ALL THE POLLS WANT

15:29.709 --> 15:32.043
THIS.
SO THAT IS ACTUALLY

15:32.143 --> 15:32.911
BIPARTISANSHIP.

15:33.378 --> 15:35.781
>> ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT THIS
QUICKLY ON A THING THIS BIG,

15:35.880 --> 15:38.048
THIS IMPORTANT IN THE MIDDLE OF
A PANDEMIC THAT YOU HAVE NO

15:38.148 --> 15:39.282
REPUBLICAN PARTNERS?

15:39.383 --> 15:43.586
>> WELL, LOOK, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO STOP SEEKING THAT SUPPORT,

15:43.686 --> 15:48.290
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF IT'S NOT
FORTHCOMING WE WILL DO WHAT THE

15:48.389 --> 15:49.157
PEOPLE WANT.

15:49.591 --> 15:50.591
>> I UNDERSTAND, BUT IS IT NOT A
LITTLE STUNNING TO YOU?

15:50.691 --> 15:53.161
IT'S A LITTLE STUNNING TO ME AND
I'M PRETTY CYNICAL.

15:53.261 --> 15:55.128
>> YOU AND I HAVE BOTH BEEN
AROUND A LONG TIME.

15:55.229 --> 15:56.195
>> I KNOW.

15:56.562 --> 15:58.864
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT STUNNING.
I GUESS I'M NOT SUPER SURPRISED

15:58.965 --> 16:00.833
ABOUT HOW THINGS GO DOWN IN THIS
TOWN.

16:00.932 --> 16:05.036
>> YOU KNOW, OVER THE BIG CRISES
THAT BIDEN LAID OUT, THE FOUR

16:05.135 --> 16:09.139
BIG CRISES THAT HE LAID OUT AT
THE INAUGURAL, COVID, ECONOMY,

16:09.239 --> 16:12.142
RACE, CLIMATE, RACIAL EQUITY IS
THE ONE THAT IS OBVIOUSLY JUST

16:12.243 --> 16:15.010
AS BIG IN SOME WAYS AS THE
OTHERS.

16:15.110 --> 16:17.080
I KNOW PART OF THE WAY YOU GUYS
ARE THINKING ABOUT IT IS IT'S

16:17.180 --> 16:21.516
NOT ABOUT PASSING A PARTICULAR
BILL OR EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT HOW

16:21.617 --> 16:23.750
DO YOU PUT A PRISM, A LENS OF
RACIAL EQUITY ON TOP OF

16:23.850 --> 16:24.484
EVERYTHING.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.487
>> FIRST OF ALL, LET ME TELL YOU
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT.

16:26.586 --> 16:30.824
TAKE HEALTH CARE, COVID HAS
EXPOSED EXTRAORDINARY

16:30.923 --> 16:35.027
DISPARITIES WHICH MANY OF US
KNEW EXISTED, SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T

16:35.126 --> 16:40.331
PERHAPS REALIZE IN THE HEALTH
STATUS OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE

16:40.431 --> 16:41.699
IN THIS COUNTRY VERSUS WHITE
PEOPLE.

16:41.798 --> 16:44.166
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID
RELIEF EFFORT THE PRESIDENT

16:44.268 --> 16:46.937
ESTABLISHED A HEALTH EQUITY TASK
FORCE WITH THE AIM OF MAKING

16:47.037 --> 16:49.838
SURE WHEN IT COMES TO DATA
COLLECTION AND TESTING AND

16:49.939 --> 16:52.673
VACCINATIONS AND THE RESOURCE
THAT IS WE'RE TRYING TO DELIVER

16:52.774 --> 16:54.008
THAT THEY'RE REACHING EVERYBODY.

16:54.108 --> 16:56.977
>> I THINK FOR A LOT OF
AFRICAN-AMERICANS JOE BIDEN IS

16:57.076 --> 16:59.846
THE CRIME BILL GUY.
THEY LOOK BACK ON THE MASS

16:59.947 --> 17:02.382
INCARCERATION THING.
I THINK IF YOU HAD ASKED A LOT

17:02.481 --> 17:04.584
OF PEOPLE THE WORLD OF RACIAL
EQUITY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN

17:04.683 --> 17:07.786
LIKE, WELL, JOE BIDEN WOULDN'T
HAVE NECESSARILY BEEN THE GUY

17:07.885 --> 17:10.489
WHO I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS IS
THE GUY WHO IS GOING TO BE THE

17:10.588 --> 17:11.788
RACIAL EQUITY PRESIDENT, RIGHT?

17:11.889 --> 17:16.191
>> I'VE KNOWN JOE BIDEN FOR MANY
YEARS AND TRUTH BE TOLD I'M NOT

17:16.293 --> 17:19.362
SURPRISED.
JOE BIDEN WAS AND IS EXTREMELY

17:19.461 --> 17:23.164
POPULAR AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS
WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS

17:23.265 --> 17:26.768
SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTOOD THE
NATURE OF OUR CONCERNS AND

17:26.867 --> 17:28.536
ASPIRATIONS.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY SOUTH

17:28.635 --> 17:32.639
CAROLINA WAS SUCH A PIVOTAL
PRIMARY, THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW,

17:32.739 --> 17:38.310
THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE WAS
VERY, VERY STRONG FOR JOE BIDEN

17:38.411 --> 17:40.912
AND KAMALA HARRIS.
JOE BIDEN IS SOMEBODY WHO IS

17:41.011 --> 17:43.581
AIMING TO MEET THE MOMENT THAT
WE'RE IN.

17:43.681 --> 17:49.218
RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY LONG
OVERDUE, BUT VERY IMPORTANTLY A

17:49.318 --> 17:51.887
TIMELY MOMENT TO TACKLE THESE
THINGS.

17:51.988 --> 18:01.961
AND I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THAT
WE MUST AND WE CAN AND SO WE

18:02.063 --> 18:02.462
SHOULD. SHOU

18:02.563 --> 18:03.064
SHOULD.

18:03.829 --> 18:04.963
>> BREAKING NEWS, THE SENATE
PARLIAMENTARIAN RULED AGAINST A

18:05.065 --> 18:08.033
$15 AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE IN
BIDEN'S COVID RELIEF BILL.

18:08.133 --> 18:13.637
>> WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY
EN PSAKI SAID THAT PRESIDENT

18:13.738 --> 18:17.107
BIDEN IS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS
COULD YOU TELL COME, HE RESPECTS

18:17.208 --> 18:17.841
THE DECISION.

18:17.941 --> 18:19.375
>> A BIG SET BACK FOR DEMOCRATS.

18:19.476 --> 18:25.114
>> PROGRESSIVES ARE GOING TO
PUSH TO OVERTURN THE

18:25.213 --> 18:25.980
PARLIAMENTARIAN.

18:26.515 --> 18:28.016
>> FOR AN ADMINISTRATION THAT
SAYS THEY'RE GOING TO FIGHT FOR

18:28.115 --> 18:32.652
BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE, FOR
WOMEN, FOR EQUALITY, FOR RACIAL

18:32.752 --> 18:35.689
EQUALITY, YOU'VE GOT TO RAISE
THE MINIMUM WAGE AND THE SKY IS

18:35.788 --> 18:43.862
NOT GOING TO FALL IN, THE GROUND
IS GOING TO BE LIFTED UP FOR 27

18:43.961 --> 18:48.065
MILLION PEOPLE.

18:48.164 --> 18:52.067
>> I THINK THE PARLIAMENTARIAN
ISSUED AN ADVISORY OPINION, BUT

18:52.168 --> 18:56.071
IT IS JUST THAT.
IT IS NOT A RULING.

18:56.171 --> 18:59.274
AND NOW WHITE HOUSE AND THE
SENATE LEADERSHIP HAVE THE

18:59.374 --> 19:01.409
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THANK YOU FOR
THAT OPINION.

19:01.508 --> 19:04.312
WE ARE GOING TO DELIVER ON THE
PROMISE OF RAISING THE WAGE FOR

19:04.412 --> 19:08.014
PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND
WE HAVE TO.

19:08.114 --> 19:11.517
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO
BACK TO PEOPLE AND SAY, I'M

19:11.616 --> 19:16.688
SORRY, I PROMISED YOU A RAISE IN
THE MINIMUM WAGE, YOUR FAMILY

19:16.787 --> 19:20.257
SUFFERING, YOU CAN'T LIVE ON
$15,000 A YEAR BUT THE

19:20.356 --> 19:22.659
PARLIAMENTARIAN RULED WE
COULDN'T DO IT, SO, SORRY, NO

19:22.759 --> 19:23.160
GO.

19:23.693 --> 19:25.394
>> THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT BIDEN
IS SAYING.

19:25.495 --> 19:27.829
THE PARLIAMENTARIAN HAS RULED,
LET'S FOCUS ON THE BIG PRIZE,

19:27.930 --> 19:29.663
WHICH IS THE PASSAGE OF THIS
BILL.

19:29.765 --> 19:32.200
HOW HARD ARE YOU GUYS PRESSING
YOUR CASE WITH THE BIDEN WHITE

19:32.299 --> 19:32.733
HOUSE?

19:33.566 --> 19:35.335
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN
PRESSING IT AND WE KNOW WHAT

19:35.435 --> 19:38.404
THEY'VE SAID.
PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

19:38.505 --> 19:43.374
BLACK, BROWN, INDIGENOUS, POOR,
WOMEN, WORKING CLASS, TURNED OUT

19:43.475 --> 19:46.912
AND DELIVERED US MAJORITIES IN
THE HOUSE, THE SENATE AND THE

19:47.011 --> 19:48.379
WHITE HOUSE.
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A

19:48.479 --> 19:51.149
CHOICE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO
THE MAT AND FIGHT.

19:51.248 --> 19:55.618
>> EVEN IF THE WHITE HOUSE GOT
ON BOARD WITH THE PLAN TO

19:55.719 --> 19:58.520
OVERRULE THE PARLIAMENTARIAN AND
SAID, ALL RIGHT, FULL STEAM

19:58.621 --> 19:58.854
AHEAD.

19:58.953 --> 19:59.654
>> YEAH.

20:00.256 --> 20:03.758
>> IT LANDS AT THE DOORSTEP OF
JOE MANCHIN WHO HAS ALREADY SAID

20:03.857 --> 20:06.960
HE'S NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR IT.

20:07.059 --> 20:09.762
>> THE POLITICAL REALITY IS IT'S
A POPULOUS POLICY, WHETHER UNOR

20:09.863 --> 20:12.364
TWO DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT TO DO
IT, IT IS A POLICY THAT THE

20:12.464 --> 20:16.700
MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS,
REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS

20:16.802 --> 20:17.435
BELIEVE IN.

20:17.935 --> 20:20.938
>> BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE
VOTES WHAT'S THE POINT?

20:21.037 --> 20:22.906
>> YOU NEVER KNOW IF YOU HAVE
THE VOTES UNTIL YOU PUSH TO THE

20:23.007 --> 20:23.406
END.

20:24.341 --> 20:25.575
>> IT SEEMS LIKE THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY IS LOOKING AT THIS MOMENT

20:25.674 --> 20:29.578
AND SAYING THIS IS GOING TO BE
JUST LIKE THE ACA, THE DEMOCRATS

20:29.679 --> 20:32.079
WILL GET OVER THEIR SKIS AND WE
WILL PUNISH THEM IN THE

20:32.181 --> 20:33.649
MIDTERMS.
YOU TALK TO PROGRESSIVES AND

20:33.748 --> 20:35.615
THEY SAY THIS ISN'T THE ACA.

20:35.716 --> 20:38.452
>> I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY
DIFFERENT FROM THE AFFORDABLE

20:38.553 --> 20:41.287
CARE ACT, WE'RE PUTTING MONEY IN
PEOPLE'S POCKETS.

20:41.387 --> 20:45.490
AT THE END OF THE DAY PEOPLE
HAVE TO WAKE UP AND FEEL LIKE

20:45.591 --> 20:47.893
THEIR LIFE IS APPRECIABLY
DIFFERENT.

20:47.992 --> 20:50.929
INEQUALITY IS AT ITS HIGHEST
SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION.

20:51.028 --> 20:56.533
THAT LEVEL OF DESPERATION IS
PART AND PARCEL OF WHAT LED TO

20:56.633 --> 20:57.835
TRUMP'S SUCCESS.

20:57.934 --> 21:00.836
>> TRUMPISM AT ITS CORE PERHAPS
ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PARTS

21:00.937 --> 21:02.270
OF IT WAS THE POPULISM.

21:02.371 --> 21:03.506
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

21:03.604 --> 21:06.540
>> AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOES
NOT SEEM TO WANT TO EMBRACE

21:06.641 --> 21:07.075
THAT.

21:07.909 --> 21:12.179
>> THEY DON'T WANT TO EMBRACE
THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY EMBRACED

21:12.278 --> 21:14.480
TRUMP AND DEMOCRATS --

21:14.581 --> 21:20.786
>> IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU HAVE
A VERY CLEAR-EYED ASSESSMENT OF

21:20.885 --> 21:24.154
THE WORK AND THE WORK IS NOT
ABOUT REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE.

21:24.255 --> 21:27.691
>> WE DON'T FEEL SAFE IN THERE,
I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND MY

21:27.790 --> 21:31.928
COLLEAGUES, WE WERE TRAPPED ON
THE GALLERY FLOOR DURING THE

21:32.027 --> 21:32.728
INSURRECTION.

21:33.027 --> 21:36.531
>> THEY BROKE THE GLASS?
EVERYBODY STAY DOWN.

21:36.632 --> 21:37.398
GET DOWN.

21:37.865 --> 21:41.735
>> WE STILL CONTINUE TO HEAR OUR
COLLEAGUES DEFENDING THOSE

21:41.835 --> 21:46.338
PEOPLE ACTIVELY PROMOTING THEM,
NOT WANTING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM

21:46.439 --> 21:49.741
OF WHAT HAPPENED.
I DON'T HAVE MUCH FAITH THAT WE

21:49.842 --> 21:54.112
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
COMMON GROUND WITH PEOPLE WHO

21:54.211 --> 21:56.814
WON'T EVEN ADMIT THAT JOE BIDEN
IS THE LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT OF

21:56.913 --> 21:59.583
THE UNITED STATES.
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A VIEW

21:59.682 --> 22:04.520
THAT IS JUST IN THE PROGRESSIVE
SIDE OF THE PARTY AND I THINK

22:04.621 --> 22:12.425
ANY NOTION THAT THE SENATE CAN
DO BIPARTISAN DEALS OR THAT THE

22:12.527 --> 22:14.362
HOUSE CAN BE BIPARTISAN IS
MISSING THE POINT.

22:14.461 --> 22:17.329
WE CAN BE BIPARTISAN FOR THE
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, BUT

22:17.430 --> 22:22.902
NOT WITH THESE ELECTED
REPRESENTATIVES.

22:23.001 --> 22:28.239
>> THE BIGGEST GATHERING OF
CONSERVATIVES, CPAC, STARTS

22:28.338 --> 22:29.338
TODAY.
CPAC SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOING TO

22:29.439 --> 22:31.975
BE A DOOZY THIS YEAR.

22:32.075 --> 22:38.947
>> HOW IS IT GOING, CPAC?

22:39.046 --> 22:43.151
>> I HEARD SOMEONE PHRASE IT A
LITTLE BIT BETTER, TPA C.

22:43.249 --> 22:45.118
IT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, GUYS.

22:45.219 --> 22:48.254
>> DIDN'T ANYBODY TELL YOU THAT
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE CANCELED?

22:48.354 --> 22:50.757
YOU DIDN'T GET THE MEMO.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ASK

22:50.856 --> 22:56.161
PERMISSION BEFORE YOU CAME HERE
TODAY.

22:56.260 --> 22:56.761
TODAY.

22:57.395 --> 23:02.531
>> JUST LIKE WE TOLD YOU, HE IS
LEADING FROM BEHIND.

23:02.632 --> 23:06.102
FROM BEHIND KAMALA, THAT IS.

23:06.201 --> 23:09.404
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE
DEMOCRATS' COVID RELIEF PLAN?

23:09.505 --> 23:12.606
>> I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO
EXTEND -- THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE

23:12.707 --> 23:14.441
CONTROL OVER PEOPLE FOR A LONGER
TIME.

23:14.542 --> 23:17.044
>> COVID RELIEF PACKAGE WOULD
SUGGEST THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY

23:17.143 --> 23:18.312
RELIEF FOR COVID IN THERE.

23:18.412 --> 23:20.681
>> DO YOU THINK THAT MESSAGE HAS
GOTTEN OUT BECAUSE IT'S VERY

23:20.780 --> 23:21.948
POPULAR WITH AMERICAN VOTERS
RIGHT NOW.

23:22.047 --> 23:25.817
>> I THINK THE COMMUNICATION
SHOULD BE BETTER ON WHAT IT ALL

23:25.918 --> 23:27.117
FUNDS OTHER THAN COVID.

23:27.218 --> 23:32.355
>> THE PROBLEM IS THE GOVERNMENT
HAS PREVENTED US FROM EARNING A

23:32.456 --> 23:36.124
LIVING AND BEING FREE.
THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE WOULD GIVE

23:36.225 --> 23:38.861
YOU MONEY TO HELP COMPENSATE FOR
THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE

23:38.961 --> 23:39.495
POPULAR.

23:40.129 --> 23:41.796
>> WHAT IS FRUSTRATING
REPUBLICANS IS ONE OF THE THINGS

23:41.896 --> 23:52.171
THEY WERE REALLY HOPING FOR FROM
JOE BIDEN WAS BIPARTISANSHIP.

23:52.271 --> 23:55.074
>> YOU KNOW, THIS WAS A GUY THAT
WAS WORKING WITH RONALD REAGAN

23:55.173 --> 23:59.309
BACK IN THE DAY, HE WAS WORKING
WITH GEORGE BUSH AND YOU ARE NOT

23:59.410 --> 24:02.980
SEEING ANY OF THAT RIGHT NOW.
REPUBLICANS THEY WERE HOPING

24:03.081 --> 24:06.415
THAT IT WASN'T JUST CAMPAIGN
RHETORIC AND NOW THEY'RE GOING

24:06.516 --> 24:10.553
TO GO AND JAM THIS STIMULUS PLAN
THROUGH AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

24:10.652 --> 24:12.587
THERE'S ANY NEGOTIATIONS GOING
ON.

24:12.688 --> 24:16.423
WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS, THEY'RE TELLING US

24:16.524 --> 24:20.527
THAT THE RADICAL LEFT WING IS
RUNNING THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT

24:20.627 --> 24:22.894
NOW.
REMEMBER BARACK OBAMA'S STIMULUS

24:22.996 --> 24:25.264
PLAN?
OH, EVERYBODY SUPPORTED IT.

24:25.364 --> 24:32.737
ONCE PEOPLE FIND OUT WHAT'S IN
IT, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE

24:32.836 --> 24:33.203
IT.

24:34.005 --> 24:34.939
>> GENERAL PROSPECT OF
REPUBLICANS, HOW ARE YOU FEELING

24:35.038 --> 24:35.706
ABOUT IT?

24:35.905 --> 24:37.806
>> REMEMBER AFTER THE '92
ELECTION?

24:37.906 --> 24:39.976
REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS DEAD.
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

24:40.075 --> 24:42.210
'94 ELECTIONS, YOU HAD A
REPUBLICAN LANDSLIDE.

24:42.310 --> 24:45.648
>> YEAH, WE DIDN'T THINK WE WERE
EVER GOING TO BE BACK AFTER '29.

24:45.748 --> 24:47.815
>> THAT WAS IT.
SOME OF THE WASHINGTON

24:47.914 --> 24:50.918
POLITICIANS MIGHT NOT BE UNIFIED
BUT THE CORE CONSERVATIVE BASE

24:51.018 --> 24:54.587
WHICH DRIVES THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY, THE PEOPLE HERE AT CPAC,

24:54.688 --> 24:57.355
THEY'RE UNIFIED.
DO YOU KNOW WHO PICKED DONALD

24:57.456 --> 24:58.556
TRUMP?
WASHINGTON DIDN'T PICK HIM.

24:58.658 --> 25:01.593
THE ESTABLISHMENT DIDN'T PICK
HIM.

25:01.692 --> 25:03.995
IT WAS THE GRASSROOTS
REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

25:04.095 --> 25:08.297
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT.

25:08.399 --> 25:10.900
>> BIG DAY FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN.

25:10.999 --> 25:14.604
>> THE HOUSE VOTES TONIGHT ON A
NEARLY $2 TRILLION CORONAVIRUS

25:14.703 --> 25:15.336
RESCUE PLAN.

25:15.437 --> 25:16.505
>> ENORMOUS BILL.

25:16.604 --> 25:18.940
>> MASSIVE PRICE TAG.

25:19.040 --> 25:29.815
>> I REMEMBER SEPTEMBER OF 2008.
WHEN THEY MET WITH HANK PAULSON,

25:29.914 --> 25:32.684
THE SECRETARY OF TREASURY, ALL
THE LEADERSHIP WAS AROUND THE

25:32.785 --> 25:33.251
TABLE.

25:33.852 --> 25:35.987
>> GOOD EVENING, I'M VERY
PLEASED TO WELCOME THE

25:36.086 --> 25:38.221
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN
LEADERSHIP OF THE HOUSE AND

25:38.322 --> 25:38.823
SENATE.

25:39.489 --> 25:52.133
>> AND THEY TOLD US WE'RE GOING
TO NEED $700 BILLION.

25:53.666 --> 25:56.537
$700 BILLION?
WE'VE NEVER VOTED FOR A BILL

25:56.636 --> 25:59.872
$700 BILLION.
OF COURSE, WE VOTED FOR IT.

25:59.971 --> 26:02.542
IT KEPT US FROM GOING INTO A
DEPRESSION.

26:02.641 --> 26:06.644
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND
VERY FRANKLY IT WAS A REPUBLICAN

26:06.745 --> 26:10.480
PRESIDENT ASKING FOR IT AND IT
WAS TWO-THIRDS OF DEMOCRATS THAT

26:10.581 --> 26:13.083
PASSED IT.
IT WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED WITHOUT

26:13.182 --> 26:15.719
DEMOCRATS SAYING IF THIS IS
NECESSARY FOR OUR COUNTRY, WE

26:15.818 --> 26:19.153
WILL DO IT.
AND THEN OF COURSE FAST FORWARD,

26:19.254 --> 26:22.355
NONE OF US WOULD HAVE EVER
PERCEIVED WHEN WE WERE ELECTED

26:22.457 --> 26:25.692
OF VOTING FOR SOME $1.9
TRILLION.

26:25.793 --> 26:33.466
FORGET ABOUT $700 BILLION.
BUT THE CHALLENGE, THE DANGER,

26:33.566 --> 26:37.067
THE CONSEQUENCES TO OUR
AMERICANS' HEALTH AND TO OUR

26:37.168 --> 26:40.537
ECONOMY WERE SUCH THAT THIS WAS
WARRANTED.

26:40.636 --> 26:43.306
>> DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT'S
HAPPENING WITH THE REPUBLICANS?

26:43.406 --> 26:49.444
IT DOES NOT SEEM -- I MEAN, I
GATHER THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT

26:49.545 --> 26:53.515
THEY CAN TAKE A $179 TRILLION
BILL, SPEND THE NEXT TWO YEARS

26:53.614 --> 26:56.517
PICKING IT APART, FINDING THINGS
THAT ARE POLITICALLY UNPOPULAR

26:56.616 --> 27:00.787
AND TRYING TO RUN AGAINST YOU
ALL ON THOSE ITEMS.

27:00.886 --> 27:03.389
DOES THAT -- IS THIS A STRATEGY
THAT CONCERNS YOU?

27:03.489 --> 27:06.124
>> I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY A BILL OF
THIS MAGNITUDE SOME THINGS ARE

27:06.225 --> 27:08.826
GOING TO WORK AND SOME THINGS
AREN'T GOING TO WORK, BUT

27:08.927 --> 27:14.698
FRANKLY I THINK THE REPUBLICANS
ARE COMFORTED IN THEIR POLICY OF

27:14.797 --> 27:16.932
OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE
THE BILL IS GOING TO PASS.

27:17.033 --> 27:19.768
THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET
THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS.

27:19.868 --> 27:25.206
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PANDER TO
THEIR HARD LINE DON'T DO

27:25.306 --> 27:29.777
ANYTHING, DON'T WEAR MASKS BASE,
AND AT THE SAME TIME NOT INCUR

27:29.876 --> 27:34.814
THE WRATH OF THOSE FOLKS WHO SEE
THIS AS SO NECESSARY.

27:34.913 --> 27:40.184
SO REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION IS
SOMEWHAT OF A SORT OF A FREE

27:40.285 --> 27:41.419
OPPOSITION STROKE.

27:41.519 --> 27:46.289
>> BIPARTISANSHIP IN WASHINGTON
MAY BE A THING OF THE PAST.

27:46.390 --> 27:49.558
ARE YOU VIEWING THESE NEXT TWO
YEARS AS I AM THE MAJORITY

27:49.659 --> 27:52.094
LEADER AND WE HAVE TO GET DONE
WHATEVER WE CAN GET DONE IN THE

27:52.193 --> 27:55.364
NEXT TWO YEARS AND WE CANNOT
RELY ON THE REPUBLICANS FOR

27:55.463 --> 28:02.868
PROGRESS AND WE CANNOT LET THEM
INTIMIDATE US INTO NOT ACTING?

28:02.969 --> 28:09.141
>> 500,000 AMERICANS HAVE DIED.
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

28:09.240 --> 28:13.344
BUSINESSES HAVE EITHER SHUT DOWN
OR GONE AWAY.

28:13.443 --> 28:17.480
PEOPLE ARE IN FOOD LINES THEY
NEVER EXPECTED IN THEIR WILDEST

28:17.581 --> 28:19.749
DREAMS THEY WOULD NEED TO BE IN
A FOOD LINE.

28:19.850 --> 28:22.684
I DON'T WANT THIS TO SOUND CORNY
BUT I THINK THE BEST POLITICS

28:22.785 --> 28:27.823
FOR US FOR '22 OR FOR '24, '26,
WHATEVER, AND I THINK BIDEN IS

28:27.922 --> 28:33.794
IN THE SAME BOAT, IS TO DO THE
RIGHT THING.

28:33.893 --> 28:37.596
>> THOSE IN FAVOR SAY AYE.
THOSE OPPOSED SAY NO.

28:37.697 --> 28:38.765
THE AYES HAVE IT.

28:38.998 --> 28:43.000
>> THE BILL IS PASSED WITHOUT
OBJECTION A MOTION TO RECONSIDER

28:43.101 --> 28:52.008
IS LAID UPON THE TABLE.
