ripping and tearing

stretched and bubbling over with

19:08.784 --> 19:10.850
Janice -- "What?
What about you?"

19:10.885 --> 19:13.820
Steve -- "Just trust me.
I have an idea."

19:13.855 --> 19:17.263
A sobbing Janice goes to
the closet and shuts the door.

19:17.298 --> 19:20.563
Then a loud bash at the bedroom
door that shakes the room.

19:20.598 --> 19:22.631
He's at the door.

19:24.569 --> 19:27.438
Steve drops to the floor
and slides under the bed.

19:27.473 --> 19:28.967
The door crashes open.

19:29.002 --> 19:32.839
The silhouette of The Whistler
fills the frame.

19:32.874 --> 19:37.910
A slice of moonlight bounces
from the blade of his knife.

19:39.650 --> 19:42.453
Eddy Park,
you are a fucking genius.

19:42.488 --> 19:44.719
The Whistler steps
into the bedroom.

19:44.754 --> 19:47.722
The floor creaks
beneath his weight.

19:47.757 --> 19:50.395
He takes a few more steps
towards the bed,

19:50.430 --> 19:52.859
just inches from where
Steve is hiding.

19:52.894 --> 19:58.436
Two Whistler slowly scans
the room and breathes in.

20:00.506 --> 20:04.277
Then, as he always
does before killed,

20:04.312 --> 20:05.971
he leans his head back

20:06.006 --> 20:10.580
and whistles
those four sinister notes.

20:20.020 --> 20:22.790
Though before the last note
has a chance to trail off

20:22.825 --> 20:25.760
into the night,
Steve lunges his arm forward.

20:25.795 --> 20:27.432
He's gripping a box cutter.

20:27.467 --> 20:28.796
Steve lets out a war cry.

20:28.831 --> 20:30.633
Aaah!

20:30.668 --> 20:33.031
He slices through
The Whistler's Achilles heel.

20:33.066 --> 20:36.507
The tendons pop and blood
sprays across the floor

20:36.542 --> 20:38.410
and across Steve's face.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.710
The Whistler grabs at his heel
and slips in the pool of blood.

20:41.745 --> 20:45.351
He hits the floor with a thud.

20:45.386 --> 20:47.518
His knife slides
across the room.

20:47.553 --> 20:49.487
Steve pulls himself
out from under the bed

20:49.522 --> 20:50.983
and rushes to the closet.

20:51.018 --> 20:53.557
He swings the door open
and Janice dives at Steve.

20:53.592 --> 20:54.987
They embrace.

20:55.022 --> 20:57.759
It's then she sees The Whistler
on the floor.

20:57.794 --> 20:59.464
She gasps.

20:59.499 --> 21:03.028
Janice pushes off Steve
and moves across the room.

21:03.063 --> 21:07.802
She grabs The Whistler's knife
from off the floor.

21:07.837 --> 21:09.738
Janice goes cold.

21:09.773 --> 21:11.839
She leans her head back

21:11.874 --> 21:15.381
and whistles those four notes.

21:15.416 --> 21:17.482
In a flash,
she plunges the knife

21:17.517 --> 21:19.550
deep into The Whistler's chest.

21:19.585 --> 21:23.884
He stiffens and expels
his last breath.

21:23.919 --> 21:25.358
He is dead.

21:25.393 --> 21:29.923
And fade to motherfucking black.

-- Steve.

23:01.016 --> 23:03.621
Steve.
Let's imagine that before Steve

23:03.656 --> 23:06.756
makes it under the bed,
I get to him first,

23:06.791 --> 23:08.923
and I grab him
by the back of his stupid

23:08.958 --> 23:13.565

and smash it as hard

23:13.600 --> 23:15.699
as I can against the wall.

23:18.572 --> 23:21.540

A desk will work fine.

It's 100% happening.

23:37.217 --> 23:39.085
Now shut the fuck up
and hear me out.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.824
Now, what if the little Stevie
pulls out his box cutter,

23:41.859 --> 23:44.728
he swings, but misses,
and I go for his wrist.

23:44.763 --> 23:46.631
-No.
-Yes.

23:46.666 --> 23:48.765

with such force that it...

23:51.000 --> 23:52.868

30:48.681 --> 30:51.121
Painting, I don't know.
I'm not an expert.

30:51.156 --> 30:53.255
Music I know. Music I love.

30:53.290 --> 30:56.093
When I was a kid,

30:56.128 --> 30:58.326
I wanted to be a rock star
when I grew up.

30:58.361 --> 31:00.196
Can you believe that?
I really did.

31:00.231 --> 31:02.000
I thought that was gonna be --
You're mad. You're mad at me.

31:02.035 --> 31:03.397
You're offended. I can tell.

31:03.432 --> 31:05.003
-I feel like I've offended you.
-No, no, no.

31:05.038 --> 31:06.202
I can't get back.
There's nothing I can do.

31:06.237 --> 31:09.139
I'm completely
100% not offended.

31:09.174 --> 31:10.701
-Really?
-Yeah.

31:10.736 --> 31:12.109
Really.

31:12.144 --> 31:13.946
Okay.

31:16.313 --> 31:20.084
You know, the thing about art

31:20.119 --> 31:25.584
is that it is really simple.

31:25.619 --> 31:28.290
It's not about what you see.

31:30.195 --> 31:32.426
It's about what you feel.

31:33.594 --> 31:35.594
Don't want to leave a stain.

31:38.038 --> 31:42.139
I believe that art is in

31:42.174 --> 31:46.308
everything and everyone.

31:46.343 --> 31:48.475
It's just that not everything
and everyone

31:48.510 --> 31:54.283
is being used properly to
transmit its power.

31:55.748 --> 31:59.992
I -- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:00.027 --> 32:02.621
Okay. For instance, this table.

32:02.656 --> 32:04.029
-Mm-hmm.
-Give me your hand.

32:07.265 --> 32:11.333
You see it as a table

32:11.368 --> 32:13.368
because you treat it that way.

32:13.403 --> 32:15.436
♪♪

32:15.471 --> 32:18.472
And you are afraid
of this wine stain,

32:18.507 --> 32:26.084
but maybe this wine stain
is exactly...

32:26.119 --> 32:29.483
what this table needs
to express a feeling

32:29.518 --> 32:36.028
and in turn transform
this meaningless object

32:36.063 --> 32:37.755
into art.

32:37.790 --> 32:41.264
So I should -- I should just
spill wine all over the table,

32:41.299 --> 32:42.760
because that's the thing?
I mean, I just --

32:42.795 --> 32:45.631
It's expensive,
so I didn't want to ruin it.

32:45.666 --> 32:49.107
It's not about the table.

32:49.142 --> 32:52.209
It's about how you feel.

32:55.412 --> 32:56.675
Okay. Come on. Come here.

32:56.710 --> 32:57.775
-Yeah?
-I'll show you.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.546
Okay.

33:04.421 --> 33:09.292
Now look at me.
You tell me what you feel.

33:12.429 --> 33:17.201
I feel like you are pretty.

33:17.236 --> 33:19.038
Interesting.

33:21.174 --> 33:25.374
Smart. Funny.

33:25.409 --> 33:27.673
I don't -- I feel like
I'm doing this wrong.

33:27.708 --> 33:30.049
Okay. Hang on. Um...

33:34.880 --> 33:36.418
Now tell me how you feel.

33:36.453 --> 33:37.584
What are you doing?

33:37.619 --> 33:41.555
Tell me how you feel.

33:41.590 --> 33:43.293
I feel like I don't like it.

33:43.328 --> 33:45.757
I feel nervous and scared.
Can -- I'm anxious.

33:45.792 --> 33:47.396
I don't like it.
C-Can you stop, please?

33:47.431 --> 33:49.431
Can you put the knife down,
please?

33:49.466 --> 33:51.169
Can you put the knife down?
Don't do that.

33:51.204 --> 33:54.667
Can you please stop, please?

33:54.702 --> 33:57.571
Please.

33:57.606 --> 33:58.638
See?

33:58.673 --> 34:01.179
I just transformed into art.

34:01.214 --> 34:02.675
I went from a girl to a feeling.

34:02.710 --> 34:04.413
And you instantly had
a visceral,

34:04.448 --> 34:05.612
emotional response to me.

34:05.647 --> 34:09.649
That is what good art does.

34:13.754 --> 34:15.589
I guess.

34:15.624 --> 34:19.659
And I could transform you
if you let me.

34:27.207 --> 34:28.338
What was that?

34:28.373 --> 34:30.340
Relax.

34:30.375 --> 34:32.144
I was just trying
to make a point.

34:32.179 --> 34:34.245
I wasn't gonna cut open my
throat on your kitchen floor.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.479
I know that. It just --
I-I got, um --

34:37.514 --> 34:39.745
I got a little freaked out.

34:39.780 --> 34:41.648
I got little scared.

34:41.683 --> 34:43.320
Oh, no.

34:43.355 --> 34:46.488
I don't want you
to be scared.

34:46.523 --> 34:49.557
I want you to be
the best that you can be.

34:52.529 --> 34:55.431
I see great things in you.

35:00.339 --> 35:04.638
You could be a rock star.

35:04.673 --> 35:06.310
My rock star.

35:06.345 --> 35:08.444
And you could be art.

35:09.909 --> 35:12.877
If you let me help you.

35:12.912 --> 35:14.813
Really?

35:14.848 --> 35:17.420
Yeah. Really.

35:19.853 --> 35:21.391
Oh.

35:21.426 --> 35:22.689
Ah, I should go.

35:22.724 --> 35:24.196
No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry. I didn't --

35:24.231 --> 35:25.791
-No, no, it's fine.
-No, I thought --

35:25.826 --> 35:27.793
I mean, come on.
We were, weren't we?

35:27.828 --> 35:29.300
-I'm not crazy.
-No, we -- we -- we were.

35:29.335 --> 35:33.634
We are.
It's just it's getting late.

35:35.572 --> 35:37.671
Hey. Is it okay if I call you?

35:46.550 --> 35:49.485
I'd be pretty pissed
if you didn't.

a masterful performance.

41:29.629 --> 41:31.662
I believed it.

41:31.697 --> 41:34.291
I'm kidding. You're great.

41:34.326 --> 41:36.799
And you shouldn't
get into your head.

41:38.935 --> 41:40.605
I should call Marcus.

That's gonna be
a real confidence booster.

Why do you hate him so much?

41:46.041 --> 41:49.075
Uh, I don't know, it's --

41:49.110 --> 41:50.714
He's a dick.

41:50.749 --> 41:52.815
Okay. He's not a dick.

41:52.850 --> 41:55.620
He's just --
He's sensitive, okay?

41:55.655 --> 41:58.788
And he has trouble communicating
in a normal way with, like,

41:58.823 --> 42:00.889
normal people.

42:00.924 --> 42:04.926
- Yeah.
That really explains it.

42:04.961 --> 42:07.863
Besides, you know what?
I'm good for him.

42:07.898 --> 42:09.227
I keep him grounded.

42:09.262 --> 42:11.097
His ex, Ivy,
remember I told you about her?

42:11.132 --> 42:13.330
She was a total psycho.

42:13.365 --> 42:15.706
Like, spent time in prison
total psycho.

42:15.741 --> 42:18.368
He needs me.

42:18.403 --> 42:19.974
- Do what you got to do.

42:20.009 --> 42:21.811
I'm gonna get more popcorn.

42:21.846 --> 42:23.879

42:38.060 --> 42:40.225
Wow.

42:40.260 --> 42:42.700
As always, could you sound
a little more excited?

42:42.735 --> 42:45.329
- I'm having
a difficult night.

42:45.364 --> 42:47.265
Okay.

42:47.300 --> 42:52.105
Well, I just wanted to tell you
I got into that acting class.

42:52.140 --> 42:53.843
- Cool.

42:53.878 --> 42:57.044
Yeah. It's tomorrow.

42:57.079 --> 43:00.014
He only accepts, like,
a handful of people,

43:00.049 --> 43:01.752
so it's actually
a pretty big deal.

43:01.787 --> 43:04.051
- Why are you wasting
your time with that shit?

43:04.086 --> 43:06.152
It's not art.

43:07.793 --> 43:11.696
- It's pretend, really,
I mean, you know.

43:11.731 --> 43:14.292
I'm over here
struggling to sketch the flow

43:14.327 --> 43:16.195
that's already intact
within the mind,

43:16.230 --> 43:19.770
and you're playing dress up.

43:19.805 --> 43:22.003
Yeah, and you're a fucking snob,
so...

43:22.038 --> 43:23.906
- Well, if a snob is
someone who pours their soul

43:23.941 --> 43:25.435
out onto the ground to be
stepped on

43:25.470 --> 43:29.142
by zombies or dullards,
then yeah, I'm a snob.

43:29.177 --> 43:32.112
Whatever, Marcus.
I just want to act.

43:32.147 --> 43:33.685
- You want to be famous.

43:33.720 --> 43:36.248
Alright.

43:36.283 --> 43:39.020
Yeah, I'm -- I'm gonna go.

43:39.055 --> 43:41.055
-- Okay.

43:43.862 --> 43:45.422
That's your man.

43:47.800 --> 43:49.800
What?

43:49.835 --> 43:53.331

Hey.

44:01.880 --> 44:03.407

I have band practice.

44:05.279 --> 44:06.476
No.

Whoo!

Goddamn fucking music, right?

46:14.012 --> 46:15.572
I mean, have you ever
really examined music?

46:15.607 --> 46:19.147
I mean, fucking really examined
it, like it's true power?

46:19.182 --> 46:20.379
Here we go.

46:20.414 --> 46:22.084
- No, no, no, no, no.
It's cool.

46:22.119 --> 46:23.481
It's cool if you guys refuse
to go deep like I do.

46:23.516 --> 46:25.186
I just happen to choose
to think about shit

46:25.221 --> 46:27.452
like how music is the soundtrack
between good and evil,

46:27.487 --> 46:29.553
and how good and evil
are, like, inextricably linked

46:29.588 --> 46:33.194
in a metaphysical battle.

46:33.229 --> 46:36.065
I'm sorry, but did you not
finish high school?

46:36.100 --> 46:37.968
No.
No, I didn't finish high school.

46:38.003 --> 46:39.563
I would expect someone like you
to judge me on whether or not

46:39.598 --> 46:41.466
I completed some
antiquated educational system

46:41.501 --> 46:43.941
that teaches kids
more lies than truth.

46:43.976 --> 46:46.537
-Preach.
-Let me ask you this.

46:46.572 --> 46:49.078
What's the happiest chord?

46:49.113 --> 46:51.509
Oh, don't ask me. I play bass.

46:51.544 --> 46:53.478
-D fucking Major.
-MAN #- Says who?

46:53.513 --> 46:56.085
It doesn't matter who says,
but you can't deny

46:56.120 --> 46:57.548
that certain chords
or chord progressions

46:57.583 --> 47:01.024
can make you feel happy
or sad or mad. Correct?

47:01.059 --> 47:03.191
Yeah, well, isn't that
the whole point of music?

47:03.226 --> 47:06.557
Yeah, dude. That really isn't
all that deep.

47:06.592 --> 47:08.900
I'll get deep. I'm just dipping
my toe in right now

47:08.935 --> 47:10.495
so you won't fucking drown.

47:10.530 --> 47:12.629
How did I end up
in a band with you?

47:12.664 --> 47:15.335
I fucking love you guys.

47:15.370 --> 47:17.502
Yes, yes, it's a given that
music can produce emotions.

47:17.537 --> 47:19.438
Everyone knows that.
But have you ever really thought

47:19.473 --> 47:21.946
about the magical mechanics
of that process?

47:21.981 --> 47:24.278
Dude, we should call the band

47:24.313 --> 47:26.247
-Magical Mechanics.
-- I love that.

47:26.282 --> 47:29.250
I arrange my flesh and bones
in a certain pattern

47:29.285 --> 47:31.054
and press them against
steel strings,

47:31.089 --> 47:32.957
and these strings have been
tightened or loosened

47:32.992 --> 47:35.421
to such a degree that it creates
a blending of sound

47:35.456 --> 47:37.654
that somehow,
over thousands of years,

47:37.689 --> 47:39.359
we as humans have decided
made sense.

47:39.394 --> 47:41.130
And then that sound travels
through an electric cord,

47:41.165 --> 47:44.331
through a wooden box,
and then out a manmade speaker.

47:44.366 --> 47:47.565
And then the sound travels
through the air

47:47.600 --> 47:49.138
and into your ear,

47:49.173 --> 47:50.568
vibrating a piece
of fucking cartilage,

47:50.603 --> 47:52.669
sending signals instantaneously
through millions,

47:52.704 --> 47:54.308
no, billions of neurons

47:54.343 --> 47:56.013
where -- where nerve cells
connect to synapses

47:56.048 --> 47:58.675
and then stimulates
a fucking emotion.

47:58.710 --> 48:01.216
An emotion, you guys.

48:01.251 --> 48:04.318
I cry every time I hear
"Nothing Compares to You."

48:04.353 --> 48:07.453
She cries every time she hears
"Nothing Compares to You."

48:07.488 --> 48:09.290
Okay.
You still haven't said anything

48:09.325 --> 48:11.160
I didn't already know.

48:11.195 --> 48:14.526
- Okay, class. What if I told
you that stimulating an emotion

48:14.561 --> 48:18.431
was just the beginning, the most
rudimentary of functions?

48:18.466 --> 48:20.664
You guys ever heard
about the brown note?

48:20.699 --> 48:23.601
Supposedly it makes you
shit your pants.

48:23.636 --> 48:25.735
I'm serious. The military
discovered it or something.

48:25.770 --> 48:29.013
What if I told you
that the power of music in sound

48:29.048 --> 48:32.049
is limitless and I've figured
out how to harness it?

48:32.084 --> 48:33.545
Then why aren't we famous yet?

48:33.580 --> 48:35.481
I'm not talking about writing
a three-minute pop song.

48:35.516 --> 48:36.713
I'm talking about
note combinations

48:36.748 --> 48:38.616
that can transform
consciousness,

48:38.651 --> 48:41.751
notes that can infiltrate
the psyche of a sane human being

48:41.786 --> 48:44.259
and unravel them into madness.

48:44.294 --> 48:47.691
Dude, how fucking high are you?

48:47.726 --> 48:50.694
Wait, how did you figure
all this out?

48:50.729 --> 48:52.498
Okay, well, I-I haven't figured
it out completely,

48:52.533 --> 48:54.731
but I have figured out how to
exactly --

48:54.766 --> 48:57.635
MAN #- There it is.
I call bullshit.

48:57.670 --> 48:59.703
I have figured out
a sequence of six notes

48:59.738 --> 49:02.211
that if played it correctly
will manifest evil.

49:02.246 --> 49:04.774
I think Black Sabbath figured
that out like 50 years ago.

49:04.809 --> 49:07.744
- That's funny.

49:07.779 --> 49:10.318
Alright. I got to get out
of here, guys.

49:10.353 --> 49:12.089
I'm fucking beat.

49:12.124 --> 49:13.618
I'm with you.

49:13.653 --> 49:15.356
It's been interesting,
as always, bro.

49:15.391 --> 49:18.326
-Mm.
-MAN #-

49:18.361 --> 49:21.131
Lightning.

49:21.166 --> 49:23.595
So what are the six notes?

49:25.467 --> 49:28.072
It's not that easy.
I mean, it's complicated.

49:28.107 --> 49:30.404
You have to be -- They have to
be played in a particular way.

49:30.439 --> 49:34.507
Like I said, bullshit.

49:34.542 --> 49:37.807
Come on. Just tell me
what the notes are.

49:37.842 --> 49:41.481
Please. Please.

49:46.125 --> 49:47.685
Anybody home?

49:51.625 --> 49:53.394
Brody.

49:57.400 --> 49:58.828
-Hey.

49:58.863 --> 50:01.534
What the fuck are you doing
sitting in the dark?

50:03.274 --> 50:04.438
Nothing.

50:04.473 --> 50:06.341
I was, um...

50:06.376 --> 50:09.212
I was just sitting.

50:09.247 --> 50:11.049
What's wrong?

50:17.156 --> 50:20.553
I, um, haven't been able
to get ahold of Marcus.

50:20.588 --> 50:24.194
He's not answering his phone
all night.

50:24.229 --> 50:26.625
Surprise, surprise.

50:28.200 --> 50:30.167
Okay, look.

50:30.202 --> 50:33.301
What if something's wrong?
What if he's hurt or something?

50:37.374 --> 50:41.409
What if he's just being
a petty little bitch?

50:41.444 --> 50:43.840
Hey, don't let him do this
to you, okay?

50:43.875 --> 50:45.644
He's just trying to
fuck with your head

50:45.679 --> 50:47.250
because you have something
important going on tomorrow

50:47.285 --> 50:49.780
that, God forbid,
doesn't revolve around him.

50:52.356 --> 50:56.490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're right. Yeah.

50:56.525 --> 51:00.494
Hey.
I'm still down to celebrate.

51:00.529 --> 51:03.794
Actually, I think I'm just
gonna go to bed.

51:07.239 --> 51:09.470
Okay. Suit yourself.

51:09.505 --> 51:11.373
But just a heads up,
I will drink all the beer

51:11.408 --> 51:14.508
and eat all the Froot Loops.

51:14.543 --> 51:17.577
You always do.
Like, every night.

51:17.612 --> 51:19.645
-Mm. Mm?
-No.

51:19.680 --> 51:23.319
-Mm. Mm? Mm?
-No.

51:25.488 --> 51:27.653
-Good night.
-Night.

59:27.167 --> 59:32.038
in a whorehouse
in southern France as a maid.

59:34.746 --> 59:37.406
She was working there

59:37.441 --> 59:41.410
to earn money to pay off
her medical bills

59:41.445 --> 59:44.985
after being savagely attacked
by a rabid dog.

59:50.388 --> 59:54.159
O...kay.

- Why are you
telling me this?

1:00:08.813 --> 1:00:12.408
He thought
if he offered her his own flesh,

1:00:12.443 --> 1:00:14.212
it would help her heal.

1:00:20.220 --> 1:00:23.694

1:00:46.851 --> 1:00:50.281
That's -- That's great.

1:00:50.316 --> 1:00:52.184
Yeah.

1:00:53.891 --> 1:00:56.089
I prepared a monologue.
