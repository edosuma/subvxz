WEBVTT

00:03.039 --> 00:05.607
So what'd you make?
Uh, what did I make?

00:05.675 --> 00:08.577
I'm glad you asked, because I
happened to make your favorite.

00:08.645 --> 00:11.180
I made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches...
Ooh.

00:11.247 --> 00:13.682
With some fruit, cheese, chocolate chip cookies

00:13.750 --> 00:15.651
And, uh...
Uh-huh.

00:15.719 --> 00:17.953
The "atlas of human anatomy"... third edition.

00:18.021 --> 00:20.689
Sounds delicious. Oh, it's very delicious.

00:20.757 --> 00:22.691
Hey, you know,
this is gonna be

00:22.759 --> 00:25.260
My ring's first picnic?

00:25.328 --> 00:28.931
Yes. This is gonna be your ring's first picnic.

00:28.998 --> 00:31.400
<i>the push comes to shove</i>

00:31.468 --> 00:35.671
<i>yeah, you don't need a watch to know</i>

00:35.739 --> 00:38.741
<i>what time it is</i>

00:38.808 --> 00:41.643
<i>don't need a plan, we can fall into it</i>

00:41.711 --> 00:43.312
Rebecca!
Aah!

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

00:53.156 --> 00:56.792
I just have this weird, foreboding feeling,

00:56.860 --> 00:58.761
and I can't get rid of it.

00:58.828 --> 01:01.663
Relax, honey. Holly is throwing the engagement party.

01:01.731 --> 01:03.999
All you have to do is show up.

01:04.066 --> 01:05.968
No, it's not about the party. It's something.

01:06.035 --> 01:08.704
And I can't sleep. I wake up
every two hours in a panic.

01:08.772 --> 01:10.706
Well, you don't have to be Freud

01:10.774 --> 01:12.708
to figure out what's going on.

01:12.776 --> 01:14.176
Your youngest son

01:14.244 --> 01:16.178
is marrying the daughter of your arch nemesis.

01:16.246 --> 01:18.447
Holly is not my arch nemesis.
What are you talking about?

01:18.515 --> 01:21.183
She slept with your husband for years,

01:21.251 --> 01:23.185
and now you're gonna have grandchildren together.

01:23.253 --> 01:24.686
Well, that idea's terrifying,

01:24.754 --> 01:26.688
but Rebecca and Justin are getting married.

01:26.756 --> 01:28.657
I'm happy for them.
Well, so what is it?

01:28.725 --> 01:31.360
Are you... you worried about mom because she's coming?

01:31.427 --> 01:33.729
No, no, it's not mom. I can handle mom.

01:33.797 --> 01:36.231
I mean, it doesn't improve my mood, but no.

01:36.299 --> 01:39.701
It... it's something. It's something about the kids.

01:39.769 --> 01:42.604
Okay, Nora, look at this. Little league, right?

01:42.672 --> 01:44.840
Remember when Justin used to get up at bat,

01:44.908 --> 01:47.576
you had to close your eyes 'cause you were afraid

01:47.644 --> 01:50.579
That he was gonna strike out?

01:50.647 --> 01:52.181
What? What is your point?

01:52.248 --> 01:53.982
My point is that nothing's changed.

01:54.050 --> 01:56.819
The kids grow up, they lead their own lives,

01:56.886 --> 01:58.687
and you worry yourself into a state

01:58.755 --> 02:00.656
about what may or may not happen.

02:00.723 --> 02:03.325
Well, there is such a thing as mother's intuition.

02:03.393 --> 02:05.327
I know that, and I appreciate that.

02:05.395 --> 02:08.030
But... but your kids are better
than they've been in a while.

02:08.097 --> 02:09.997
Tommy is getting all the help he needs.

02:10.066 --> 02:12.634
Kitty is working things out with Robert.

02:12.702 --> 02:14.636
Kevin and Scotty are status quo.

02:14.704 --> 02:16.638
Sarah is finally getting out and dating again.

02:16.706 --> 02:19.141
And Justin is going to be a doctor.

02:19.209 --> 02:21.210
Yes, but so many things could go wrong.

02:21.277 --> 02:23.378
You need to relax and let yourself be happy, okay?

02:23.446 --> 02:25.681
You're allowed to do that. Now come on.

02:25.748 --> 02:27.216
Let's get these pictures together

02:27.283 --> 02:29.218
and bring 'em over to Holly.

02:29.285 --> 02:31.753
Everything is gonna be fine. I will make sure of it.

02:31.821 --> 02:33.355
All right.

02:33.423 --> 02:35.858
The legislature needs to learn
to live within its means,

02:35.925 --> 02:37.860
just like the rest of Californians.

02:37.927 --> 02:40.128
And when I'm governor, they'll
do it without cutting programs

02:40.196 --> 02:42.331
Like this one.
Kitty, so good to see your byline

02:42.398 --> 02:44.833
back on the op-ed pages and online again.

02:44.901 --> 02:47.536
Your commentary's always
so smart and entertaining.

02:47.604 --> 02:50.606
Thank you. I am actually
enjoying getting back into it.

02:50.673 --> 02:52.507
And I've... I've discovered that I prefer writing

02:52.575 --> 02:54.209
to television commentary.

02:54.277 --> 02:56.011
And why is that?

02:56.079 --> 02:58.981
Well, I... I get to spend a lot of time with our son

02:59.048 --> 03:01.617
and I get to go to work in my pajamas.

03:01.684 --> 03:03.619
Speaking of which,

03:03.686 --> 03:06.288
you guys get these strange
bedfellows questions a lot.

03:06.356 --> 03:09.258
Well, yes, we have some
pretty interesting discussions

03:09.325 --> 03:11.360
at our dinner table.

03:11.427 --> 03:13.862
Yeah, and anything he says
in his sleep is on the record.

03:13.930 --> 03:16.365
I mean, do you see what I'm up against?

03:19.235 --> 03:22.838
So... so that line about you talking in your sleep,

03:22.906 --> 03:25.807
that was... that was really lame.
No, it was fine.

03:25.875 --> 03:27.843
Did it even make sense?
No, it was good.

03:27.911 --> 03:30.345
You guys were great back there.
Oh, please.

03:30.413 --> 03:31.847
No, really.

03:31.915 --> 03:34.449
So adorable, I wanted to pinch both your cheeks.

03:34.517 --> 03:37.052
You want to see what I twittered?
Yeah, you always do give good tweet.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.555
All right, I have to get back in there.
Do you, uh, do you want me to go with you?

03:40.623 --> 03:43.125
No, I'm fine.

03:43.192 --> 03:45.093
Wow.

03:45.161 --> 03:48.297
85 degrees, and I still feel the chill.

03:48.364 --> 03:50.265
I know he appreciates what you're doing.

03:50.333 --> 03:53.769
So just... just hang in there, okay? He'll come around.

03:53.836 --> 03:55.604
What else can I do?

03:59.008 --> 04:01.209
I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.

04:01.277 --> 04:03.712
I mean, I've never even bought shoes online before.

04:03.780 --> 04:06.848
Oh, I'm so glad you said that.
You're my first online date.

04:06.916 --> 04:09.618
Though I have bought plenty of shoes.

04:11.854 --> 04:14.056
You're not what I was expecting.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.625
Not in a bad way.
Oh.

04:16.692 --> 04:19.461
Just that your picture looked kinda different.
How?

04:19.529 --> 04:21.495
Well, online I thought I sensed red.

04:21.564 --> 04:23.966
But you're definitely more of an orange.

04:24.033 --> 04:25.500
You mean my skin tone?

04:25.568 --> 04:28.103
Your aura.

04:28.171 --> 04:31.139
You even have a... little yellow halo.

04:33.476 --> 04:35.944
I can't tell you how nice it is to be here

04:36.012 --> 04:38.347
with someone normal.
Thanks.

04:38.414 --> 04:40.682
Oh, thank you.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.718
Use these.
They're sanitized.

04:44.554 --> 04:47.055
Wait. Uh, this is your resume?

04:47.123 --> 04:49.057
Yeah. Uh, take a look.

04:49.125 --> 04:52.027
From '97 to '02, I was in the food business.

04:52.095 --> 04:54.229
You're here for a job?

05:01.137 --> 05:03.105
Okay, just to clarify,

05:03.172 --> 05:05.173
if we take an egg from a separate donor

05:05.241 --> 05:06.608
and use a gestational surrogate,

05:06.676 --> 05:10.245
neither one have any claim on the baby?
That's correct.

05:10.313 --> 05:12.848
Okay, and how do we go about selecting an egg donor?

05:12.915 --> 05:15.684
You give us your parameters... eye color, hair color,

05:15.752 --> 05:18.286
ethnicity...
Oh... I don't care about that.

05:18.354 --> 05:20.655
Talents, education, I.Q.

05:20.723 --> 05:23.558
I care about that. What?
What's wrong with that?

05:23.626 --> 05:25.560
Okay, clearly we have a lot to discuss.

05:25.628 --> 05:28.063
Do you... do you have any, um, literature, a brochure,

05:28.131 --> 05:29.765
something we can take home?

05:29.832 --> 05:32.100
Yes. We have an orientation kit.

05:32.168 --> 05:35.137
Oh, wow. It'll explain all the legal
and medical requirements.

05:35.204 --> 05:37.239
It takes you through the whole process.

05:37.306 --> 05:39.007
We also have a price breakdown,

05:39.075 --> 05:41.676
depending on whether you use one of our surrogates,

05:41.744 --> 05:45.380
uh, how many eggs we harvest,
how many implantations it takes

05:45.448 --> 05:47.749
to achieve a pregnancy.
How much would it cost

05:47.817 --> 05:50.752
for a baby without leather seats and a dvd player?

05:50.820 --> 05:53.688
Kevin. I'm s... I'm sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.

05:53.756 --> 05:55.690
A... assuming the best outcome,

05:55.758 --> 05:59.127
about $137,000.

06:00.730 --> 06:03.031
Oh, wow. Oh.

06:03.099 --> 06:05.167
Well, we... we knew it was gonna be expensive.

06:05.234 --> 06:07.636
Yeah, yeah, it's... it's about what we thought.

06:07.703 --> 06:10.639
It's just, I think, when you hear it out loud, it...

06:10.706 --> 06:13.675
sort of takes your breath away.

06:15.678 --> 06:18.580
Where would you like it?
Okay, stack that out by the other ones.

06:18.648 --> 06:20.882
Right here?
Oh, my God.

06:20.950 --> 06:23.051
Ooh. Wow. Look at this.

06:23.119 --> 06:26.088
What on heaven's name is this?
Oh, she really went all out, didn't she? Wow.

06:26.155 --> 06:27.856
Yes. It's awful.

06:27.924 --> 06:30.192
Hi.
Hi.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.693
So what do you think?

06:31.761 --> 06:33.895
What a transformation.
Yeah.

06:33.963 --> 06:35.430
Right? Well...
Hi, Saul.

06:35.498 --> 06:37.732
David.
Rebecca wanted
an all-white theme,

06:37.800 --> 06:40.635
and I'm never one to go halfway, so...
Yeah, we... Holly, though, we...

06:40.703 --> 06:43.672
we did decide to not spend
very much money on...

06:43.739 --> 06:46.875
Right, on the gift.
You said that the party was your gift.

06:46.943 --> 06:48.777
No, the way I think about it is,

06:48.845 --> 06:52.481
the party's the party, and the gift is the gift.
We agreed that we wouldn't...

06:52.548 --> 06:54.983
No, no, we agreed that I wouldn't spend money...
David, I think this is the right time...

06:55.051 --> 06:57.919
Yeah, I think it's the perfect time. Ladies, ladies!
Nora.

06:57.987 --> 07:00.889
What?
Let's, uh, let's have a seat.

07:00.957 --> 07:04.025
We're just trying to save you from yourselves, okay?

07:04.093 --> 07:05.660
Okay.
Oh, come on.

07:05.728 --> 07:08.363
This is not about either of you.
This is about your children.

07:08.431 --> 07:10.632
We know that. We are perfectly fine.
We're fine with it.

07:10.700 --> 07:13.568
Great. So, Nora, you understand
that Holly is giving this party?

07:13.636 --> 07:16.438
She is the hostess and she makes all the decisions.
Yes, I'm great with that.

07:16.506 --> 07:18.573
And, Holly, you understand that Nora is the mother

07:18.641 --> 07:20.575
of the groom-to-be...
Yes, I know that.

07:20.643 --> 07:21.977
So you have to honor

07:22.044 --> 07:24.379
her position in the family as equal to yours?

07:24.447 --> 07:27.048
Don't be silly. I mean, we are perfectly fine.
Right. We're fine.

07:27.116 --> 07:29.151
Great. Okay.
Okay. Great.

07:29.218 --> 07:31.186
That's all we want to know, right?
Perfect.

07:31.254 --> 07:34.089
Oh, my God.
What?

07:34.157 --> 07:35.757
That's beautiful!

07:35.825 --> 07:39.528
Rebecca always wanted a piano in the house.
You bought her a piano?

07:39.595 --> 07:42.130
Relax. I rented it.
You rented a white piano.

07:42.198 --> 07:44.900
Nora, come on. The decisions...
It's fine. It's beautiful.

07:44.967 --> 07:47.602
Oh, it's so nice. Isn't it great?
It's beautiful. You can't leave it there, though.

07:47.670 --> 07:49.571
Uh, you have to move... why?

07:49.639 --> 07:51.606
It blocks your view. You have a lovely view.

07:51.674 --> 07:54.042
You have to move it a little bit over that way.
I... I know,

07:54.110 --> 07:55.710
but the floor squeaks  over the...

07:55.778 --> 07:58.547
Well, put one of these lovely
white rug things under there.

07:58.614 --> 08:00.682
It'd be... but, you know, it's your party.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.552
I, you know, it's whatever... your party.
Okay. No, okay. You guys, could you please

08:03.619 --> 08:06.188
move the piano over just a little bit?
Yeah, just a little bit.

08:06.255 --> 08:08.323
Just a little.
Go, go, go, go, go. Ooh.

08:08.391 --> 08:09.824
That's good.
That's great.

08:09.892 --> 08:11.793
Isn't that nice?
It looks good.

08:11.861 --> 08:14.362
Great. Great. Thanks. We've got
some photographs here

08:14.430 --> 08:17.065
if you all want to see them.
Yeah, I want to see 'em.

08:17.133 --> 08:19.167
I found some of Rebecca that I thought would be...

08:19.235 --> 08:22.103
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

08:22.171 --> 08:25.207
Oh! Oh, no! My party.

08:25.274 --> 08:28.476
My goodness. That's not good.

08:36.152 --> 08:37.552
Hey.

08:37.620 --> 08:39.187
Hey.

08:39.255 --> 08:41.823
You look exhausted. Are you all right?

08:41.890 --> 08:45.026
I have so much work to do, it's insane.

08:45.094 --> 08:48.196
Well, why don't you take a break?
Yeah, I wish.

08:48.264 --> 08:50.498
Maybe... maybe you can help me.

08:50.566 --> 08:53.168
You want to quiz me on the bones of the hand?

08:53.236 --> 08:55.337
Sure. There's, uh, there's 27 of 'em.

08:55.404 --> 08:58.173
Really?
Yeah. All right. Give me your hand.

08:58.241 --> 08:59.774
Okay. Ready?
Mm-hmm.

08:59.842 --> 09:01.743
Carpus. Metacarpus.

09:01.811 --> 09:03.778
Uh, digitus secundus manus.
Mm-hmm.

09:03.846 --> 09:05.447
Digitus medius.

09:05.514 --> 09:08.984
And digitus... oh, God.

09:09.051 --> 09:11.720
Um... Oh, I always forget this one.

09:11.787 --> 09:14.823
Digitus... sparkly ringamus.

09:19.228 --> 09:20.862
Oh, my God.

09:20.930 --> 09:23.765
Oh, Justin. It's beautiful.

09:23.833 --> 09:26.201
Well, I figured it was time for an upgrade

09:26.269 --> 09:28.503
from the bent nail I made you in Mexico, so...

09:28.571 --> 09:31.773
Oh, it's perfect. Can we afford this?

09:31.841 --> 09:33.775
Oh, yeah. My, uh, my mom gave it to us.

09:33.843 --> 09:36.444
This was my great-grandmother's ring.
Oh! Really?

09:36.512 --> 09:38.179
All right, now how about

09:38.247 --> 09:41.016
I take you and this rock out to dinner?

09:41.083 --> 09:43.952
What about studying?
Oh, studying? Come on.
That's my decoy move.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.453
I'm finished.

09:45.521 --> 09:47.155
I love you.

09:47.223 --> 09:49.557
I love you.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.359
Mm.

09:51.427 --> 09:52.861
Now...

09:52.928 --> 09:57.432
if you want your anatomy lesson...

10:03.464 --> 10:05.732
she's got termites. They ate clear through her joists.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.968
The only solution was to move the party here.

10:08.036 --> 10:10.971
Why do I get the impression
that you went over to Holly's

10:11.039 --> 10:14.942
and put those termites under her house yourself?
Don't be ridiculous.

10:15.009 --> 10:17.978
Mm. Come on, mom. Admit it. You're
enjoying this just a little.

10:18.046 --> 10:20.714
Now why would I enjoy having Holly's party here?

10:20.782 --> 10:23.050
Because now it's your party.
Mm-hmm.

10:23.117 --> 10:26.053
No, no, no, it's not. I'm going
to be completely magnanimous.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.222
It is Holly's party. She is the hostess of it.

10:28.289 --> 10:30.257
I heard grandma's coming.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.726
Oh, dear.
Let the disapproval begin.

10:32.794 --> 10:36.697
Well, she's my mother.
It's fine. I've accepted it.

10:36.764 --> 10:39.433
Just keep telling yourself that, mom.
Yeah, you know what? It's a proven fact.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.468
There is nothing that can irritate a daughter

10:41.536 --> 10:43.971
more than her mother.
Honey, you're not eating anything.

10:44.038 --> 10:45.873
Can I fix you something else?

10:45.940 --> 10:47.808
Uh, no. Yeah, I'm just... Evan and I have been

10:47.876 --> 10:49.910
passing back and forth this... this virus.

10:49.978 --> 10:51.612
I get a fever. He gets a fever.

10:51.679 --> 10:53.547
It just comes and goes. I don't...

10:53.615 --> 10:55.515
Oh, hey. How is the couples' counseling going?

10:55.583 --> 10:58.685
Um, well, we've been given
intimacy homemork exercises,

10:58.753 --> 11:00.520
if you can believe that.

11:00.588 --> 11:01.989
Sex homework?

11:02.056 --> 11:04.892
Mnh-mnh. We're j... we're just supposed to...

11:04.959 --> 11:07.728
communicate our feelings nonverbally.
If I did that with Joe

11:07.795 --> 11:10.597
when we were going through the thick of it,

11:10.665 --> 11:12.666
he would be dead.

11:12.734 --> 11:15.636
Though I have to say, as much
of a jerk as Joe could be,

11:15.703 --> 11:18.338
he's not half as weird as those
freaks I'm meeting online.

11:18.406 --> 11:20.774
Oh, honey. I'm sorry that didn't work out for you.

11:20.842 --> 11:22.776
Oh, it's okay, mom. I put it behind me.

11:22.844 --> 11:24.878
Joe's got the kids for three more weeks,

11:24.946 --> 11:27.781
so I'm escaping to Paris,
where I shall be a free girl,

11:27.849 --> 11:29.249
unfettered and alive.

11:29.317 --> 11:32.386
This time tomorrow night, I shall be in France.

11:32.453 --> 11:35.088
And if the guys are jerks, I won't care,

11:35.156 --> 11:37.791
'cause they'll be speaking French.

11:37.859 --> 11:40.627
Did you tell Rebecca you can't come to her party?

11:40.695 --> 11:44.598
Of course, mom. Oh, she said
that Tommy called, apologized

11:44.666 --> 11:47.434
and said that he would make
it up to her at her wedding.

11:47.502 --> 11:50.337
Good.
I wish he'd call me.

11:50.405 --> 11:53.206
Okay. This is what I'm gonna make...

11:53.274 --> 11:55.976
seared sea scallops wrapped in bacon.

11:56.044 --> 11:59.012
Then I'm gonna find a little vegetarian something.
Mom, mom.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.381
What?
Don't forget, it's Holly's party.

12:01.449 --> 12:03.850
Well, I know. I'm just gonna help a little bit.

12:03.918 --> 12:05.018
Hmm.

12:05.086 --> 12:10.691
I'm so sorry I'm gonna miss this.

12:10.758 --> 12:12.693
I'm so sorry. I... I feel responsible.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.728
No, sweetie. No.

12:14.796 --> 12:17.564
It's just a... a minor train wreck.

12:17.632 --> 12:21.501
But nothing is going to spoil your party.

12:21.569 --> 12:24.771
I love the white, too. It's beautiful.

12:24.839 --> 12:27.240
Oh, good. Well, I've talked to the party planner,

12:27.308 --> 12:29.343
and they're getting, like, 100 more yards

12:29.410 --> 12:31.211
to decorate Nora's house,

12:31.279 --> 12:33.680
which will be even better there
with those high ceilings.

12:33.748 --> 12:36.183
It'll be more dramatic.
Yeah.

12:36.250 --> 12:39.286
So do you notice anything different about me?

12:39.354 --> 12:41.922
No.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.958
It's not your hair.

12:45.026 --> 12:46.693
It's not your shoes.

12:46.761 --> 12:48.695
What?

12:51.532 --> 12:54.234
Oh, whoa. When did he give you that?

12:54.302 --> 12:56.670
Last night.

12:56.738 --> 12:58.672
Ohh. That's gotta be, like, 2 carats.

12:58.740 --> 13:01.375
Isn't it beautiful? Nora gave it to Justin.

13:01.442 --> 13:03.877
It was her grandmother's.

13:03.945 --> 13:05.045
Rely?

13:05.113 --> 13:06.279
Mm-hmm.

13:06.347 --> 13:08.115
Wow. That's beautiful, honey.

13:08.182 --> 13:10.017
Isn't it?
It's great.

13:10.084 --> 13:13.387
You know... there's something I've gotta do.

13:13.454 --> 13:15.822
Are you all right if yo home and relax

13:15.890 --> 13:17.691
and then meet me at the party?
Yeah, perfect.

13:17.759 --> 13:20.460
Okay? That'd be great.
I'll see you there. Okay.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.064
Justin.

13:24.132 --> 13:26.333
Come on in.
Professor Gray, how's it going?

13:26.401 --> 13:28.702
Shut the door.

13:28.770 --> 13:31.471
Sure.

13:31.539 --> 13:34.307
Sit down.

13:36.210 --> 13:38.145
Is, uh, is something wrong?

13:38.212 --> 13:40.147
These, uh,

13:40.214 --> 13:44.051
combined M.D./B.A. programs are incredibly tough.

13:44.118 --> 13:46.753
Yeah. We have students
with perfect S.A.T. scores

13:46.821 --> 13:49.756
and Ivy league education who can't cut it.

13:49.824 --> 13:52.726
Your, uh, first term reports came in,

13:52.794 --> 13:56.029
and I am sorry to say that you are in trouble.

13:57.298 --> 13:59.199
It's, uh, it's... it's biochem, isn't it?

13:59.267 --> 14:00.667
I'm... I'm sorry, sir...

14:00.735 --> 14:03.403
It's everything... biochemistry, organic chemistry,

14:03.471 --> 14:06.106
physics and calculus.

14:08.509 --> 14:12.212
I have had to turn down
a lot of qualified applicants

14:12.280 --> 14:14.247
for this program.

14:14.315 --> 14:17.250
To be honest, you were not even in the top 20.

14:17.318 --> 14:20.487
Um... then... then why am I here, sir?

14:20.555 --> 14:22.322
I got the call.

14:22.390 --> 14:23.824
What call?

14:23.891 --> 14:25.292
Three calls, actually.

14:25.359 --> 14:29.029
You'd be surprised how quickly
the regents pick up the phone

14:29.097 --> 14:31.898
whenever a U.S. Senator puts a word in.

14:31.966 --> 14:34.534
Um... that... that didn't come from me.

14:34.602 --> 14:36.536
I... I didn't ask for any of that to...

14:36.604 --> 14:38.071
Regardless,

14:38.139 --> 14:41.808
you have been given an incredible opportunity.

14:41.876 --> 14:45.312
But if this is the caliber of work that we can expect,

14:45.379 --> 14:48.315
I... I just don't think this is going to work out.
It's not, sir. I'm... I'm gonna work much harder.

14:48.382 --> 14:50.484
I'll, uh, I'll study more. I'll do whatever it takes.

14:50.551 --> 14:53.720
Good, 'cause you are going to
have to work incredibly hard

14:53.788 --> 14:56.223
to turn this around, Justin.
I understand.

14:56.290 --> 14:59.693
<i>baby, baby, baby, I love you</i>

14:59.760 --> 15:01.661
<i>ain't no doubt about it</i>

15:01.729 --> 15:04.798
<i>baby, I love you</i>

15:04.866 --> 15:08.101
Come on. Sing with me. Let your hair down.
Oh, I didn't know my hair was up.

15:08.169 --> 15:11.138
Okay, I have just been
to the bank, and guess what.

15:11.205 --> 15:14.975
<i>we are standing on our baby</i>

15:15.042 --> 15:17.410
<i> baby...
What?</i>

15:17.478 --> 15:19.746
<i>I know, I'm gonna...
What are you talking about?</i>

15:19.814 --> 15:22.415
<i>give it to you
Wait, wait. What are you talking about?</i>

15:22.483 --> 15:25.252
Okay, listen to me. We don't owe much on this loft okay?

15:25.319 --> 15:28.054
The guy at the bank said
we can take a line of credit.

15:28.122 --> 15:30.657
We'll have more than enough for the surrogacy.

15:30.725 --> 15:33.393
We'll probably have enough
leftover to buy a couple of

15:33.461 --> 15:36.730
those cute little Marc Jacobs suits... if it's a boy.

15:36.797 --> 15:39.699
What's wrong? I just solved the money problem.
You're talking about going into debt

15:39.767 --> 15:41.268
before the baby's even born.

15:41.335 --> 15:44.204
I mean, we haven't bought
one diaper yet, let alone...

15:44.272 --> 15:46.173
I mean, child care, there's doctor's appointments,

15:46.240 --> 15:48.808
school...
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry. I'm a little confused,

15:48.876 --> 15:51.144
because I thought you...
you wanted this baby, too.

15:51.212 --> 15:52.679
I do. I just...

15:52.747 --> 15:54.748
I don't move as fast as you do.

15:54.815 --> 15:57.751
I need some time to sort things out.

15:57.818 --> 15:59.986
I mean, Kevin, we went to
the agency for information.

16:00.054 --> 16:02.756
They gave us a hundred pages of things...
I was there.

16:02.823 --> 16:04.758
I... I just need to process things

16:04.825 --> 16:07.527
before we go talking to a banker.
All right, fine.

16:07.595 --> 16:11.231
Last thing I wanted to do is put pressure on you.
Good.

16:11.299 --> 16:14.201
You know, because a baby
isn't like a Marc Jacobs suit.

16:14.268 --> 16:16.203
You can't return it if it doesn't fit.

16:16.270 --> 16:19.539
Who said anything about it not fitting?

16:19.607 --> 16:23.710
Are y... are you having second thoughts about this?
No.

16:25.179 --> 16:28.081
Maybe. Kevin...

16:28.149 --> 16:30.617
Why don't I just stop talking for a while?

16:30.685 --> 16:32.752
That's a good idea.

16:41.028 --> 16:42.696
Honey.

16:42.763 --> 16:45.532
I'm sorry. It's... it's a bad habit. Here we go.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.068
Did you just roll your eyes?
No, no.

16:48.135 --> 16:49.736
I'm... I'm... I'm right here.

16:49.804 --> 16:51.371
I'm... I'm... I'm doing this.

16:51.439 --> 16:54.207
Okay, well, then let's just do it.

16:59.547 --> 17:01.014
My eyes are watering.

17:01.082 --> 17:03.683
So blink. Blink. Robert, this is not a staring contest.

17:03.751 --> 17:06.252
You are allowed to blink.
Look, I said I would go to couples' therapy.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.255
I didn't say I'd do these stupid exercises.

17:08.321 --> 17:10.223
What is this?
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.026
I leave Evan four nights a week and I go to

17:13.094 --> 17:15.428
One rubber-chicken-dinner
fund-raiser after another, and...

17:15.496 --> 17:17.931
But I never asked you to do that.
Well, I never said you did.

17:17.999 --> 17:20.800
But... but I go because you
are running for governor.

17:20.867 --> 17:22.636
And I am trying to make an effort,

17:22.703 --> 17:24.570
And I... I think that you can try, too.

17:24.638 --> 17:27.073
And there's a little guilt from last spring.

17:27.141 --> 17:29.009
When are you gonna stop punishing me?

17:29.076 --> 17:32.178
I mean, I... I'm not punishing you for lying to me.

17:32.246 --> 17:34.547
I'm not punishing you.

17:34.615 --> 17:37.550
You know, Robert, I want to make our marriage work.

17:37.618 --> 17:40.186
I really do.

17:40.254 --> 17:41.688
But if you don't...

17:41.756 --> 17:43.156
No, I...

17:43.224 --> 17:45.158
I am just looking for something,

17:45.226 --> 17:49.462
for some... spark

17:49.530 --> 17:52.399
to tell me that we have a chance.

17:52.466 --> 17:55.402
And?

17:55.469 --> 17:58.805
So far, I'm not seeing it.

18:02.810 --> 18:04.744
I got him.

18:04.812 --> 18:06.713
No, he probably has a fever.

18:06.781 --> 18:09.182
I know. I got it.

18:26.326 --> 18:28.994
Hard to believe there's two white baby grand pianos

18:29.062 --> 18:30.163
in Los Angeles.

18:30.230 --> 18:31.031
Lovely, right?

18:31.099 --> 18:34.033
Yes. Uh, Holly, I don't want to say anything,

18:34.101 --> 18:36.969
but your party planner person is in my stairway.

18:37.037 --> 18:39.338
He seems to be taking down all my family photos.

18:39.406 --> 18:42.341
He could just hide them under...
You don't have to worry about your photographs.

18:42.409 --> 18:43.377
They're gonna take care of them. Um, excuse me.

18:43.444 --> 18:46.413
Could you please move this table into the garage?
No, you can't move

18:46.481 --> 18:48.316
my dining room table out into the garage.

18:48.384 --> 18:53.986
We need the room so we can mingle.
Holly, people have been successfully mingling

18:54.054 --> 18:55.289
in this room for hundreds of parties.

18:55.356 --> 18:59.525
Trust me.
Trust you? Well, now isn't that hilarious?

18:59.593 --> 19:01.394
Seeing that you walked all over our agreement.

19:01.461 --> 19:04.463
What do you mean? I've been nothing but gracious...
Nora. Nora. Nora.

19:04.531 --> 19:07.166
There's a strange man
out there rearranging furniture.

19:07.234 --> 19:09.168
Mother, what are you doing here?

19:09.236 --> 19:11.470
I thought I was invited.

19:11.538 --> 19:13.906
Well, yes, you are invited. No, welcome.

19:13.974 --> 19:16.976
Mother, welcome. I'm so glad to see you.

19:17.044 --> 19:18.377
You look lovely. Yes, yes.

19:18.445 --> 19:21.214
I just... I thought Saul was
picking you up at the airport

19:21.281 --> 19:23.249
to take you to his place

19:23.317 --> 19:26.052
so you could have a nap or a shower...
I'm not infirm.

19:26.119 --> 19:28.521
I am perfectly capable of taking a taxi,

19:28.589 --> 19:32.258
and I don't want a nap?
Holly Harper, mother of the bride.

19:32.326 --> 19:34.093
Va-va-voom.

19:34.161 --> 19:37.296
Ida Holden, grandmother of the groom.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

19:37.364 --> 19:40.299
Well, I can't wait for you to
meet Rebecca, the... the bride.

19:40.367 --> 19:41.834
She's so tall. She's beautiful.

19:41.902 --> 19:45.705
Oh, I'm sure she is. She has such a lovely mother.
Thank you.

19:45.772 --> 19:49.175
Nora, you've never told me.
How did Justin and Rebecca meet?

19:49.243 --> 19:51.177
Holly, I smell your cake burning.
So do I.

19:51.245 --> 19:53.980
Yes. In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.

19:54.047 --> 19:56.515
I don't smell anything.
You will, mother. You will.

19:56.583 --> 19:59.118
You never told her?

19:59.186 --> 20:01.754
Oh.

20:01.822 --> 20:04.724
I told my mother William had a mistress.

20:04.791 --> 20:06.759
I neglected to tell her the mistress' name,

20:06.827 --> 20:08.728
much less the fact that we thought Rebecca

20:08.795 --> 20:10.730
was Justin's sister for a while.

20:10.797 --> 20:13.733
I can't conceive of how I will explain Ryan to her.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.735
So please, please, Holly, don't say anything.

20:15.802 --> 20:17.703
Well, why would I say anything?

20:17.771 --> 20:20.706
It's not like I'd lead with, "hey, hi, I'm the mistress."

20:20.774 --> 20:23.209
Okay, so Rebecca and Justin met at a bar.

20:23.277 --> 20:26.145
No, no, wait, wait, wait, no.
That makes her sound too slutty.

20:26.213 --> 20:28.714
Well, then what? How about mutual friends?
Mutual friends...

20:28.782 --> 20:30.983
Nobody offered me anything to eat on the airplane.

20:31.051 --> 20:33.586
Mom... apparently I'm getting
the same service here.

20:33.654 --> 20:35.988
Oh, you must be exhausted. Come on.

20:36.056 --> 20:39.358
Why don't you sit down? I've got some quiche in the oven.
I thought we were having cake.

20:39.426 --> 20:41.627
I've never liked these stools.

20:41.695 --> 20:43.896
They're just too high for me.

20:43.964 --> 20:46.165
You know, I prefer to sit at a proper table,

20:46.233 --> 20:48.701
but two men just picked up your dining room table

20:48.769 --> 20:50.870
and walked away with it, Nora.

20:54.006 --> 20:55.807
You shoulda told me.

20:55.874 --> 20:56.642
You asked for a recommendation.

20:56.710 --> 20:58.644
No, I asked for a letter of recommendation.

20:58.712 --> 21:01.880
I didn't ask you to call three regents.
Okay, well, the distinction is lost on me.

21:01.948 --> 21:03.749
The distinction is, I'm in this program

21:03.817 --> 21:04.484
not because I belong there,

21:04.552 --> 21:06.486
but because my brother-in-law is a U.S. Senator.

21:06.554 --> 21:09.356
Well, don't kid yourself. Calls are made all the time.

21:09.423 --> 21:12.359
I mean, they wouldn't have let
you in if you weren't qualified.
You should've seen my advisor's face.

21:12.426 --> 21:14.995
He practically told me I'm
too dumb to be in this program.
Now why would he say that?

21:15.062 --> 21:17.030
Because apparently, I'm in way over my head.

21:17.098 --> 21:19.633
Honestly, I think this guy wants me to flunk out

21:19.700 --> 21:22.602
so he can give my seat
to someone who deserves it.
Okay, now hold on.

21:22.670 --> 21:24.771
I wouldn't have written the letter or made the calls

21:24.839 --> 21:26.640
if I didn't think you deserved it.

21:26.707 --> 21:28.508
Okay, you've been a medic in two wars.

21:28.576 --> 21:30.577
You've dealt with everything on the battlefield,

21:30.645 --> 21:32.479
from sucking chest wounds to amputations,

21:32.546 --> 21:35.081
and I don't think most of those
science geeks can say that.

21:35.149 --> 21:37.283
If it's the academics,
then, you know,

21:37.351 --> 21:40.286
you gotta man up and work harder.
Man up? You want me to... how am I supposed to man up

21:40.354 --> 21:43.256
when all my professors resent my even being there?
Justin, you're not gonna solve whatever's wrong here

21:43.324 --> 21:45.492
by continuing to blame me for helping you.

21:45.559 --> 21:47.360
Well, maybe the problem is,

21:47.428 --> 21:50.063
whatever I have to "solve" isn't solvable.

21:51.799 --> 21:53.600
<i>apple head</i>

21:53.668 --> 21:55.468
<i>makes me smile</i>

21:55.536 --> 21:56.970
<i>laugh and cry</i>

21:57.038 --> 21:59.506
Mm. His ears look fine.

21:59.573 --> 22:02.409
I think he's just teething.
That's really good,

22:02.476 --> 22:04.878
because I thought maybe, I had given him something.

22:04.945 --> 22:06.813
I've been having this sort of...

22:06.881 --> 22:09.082
I don't know, this low-grade fever thing.

22:09.150 --> 22:11.251
You do look a little pale. How's your energy?

22:11.318 --> 22:13.987
Oh, well, it's not as good as his.

22:14.055 --> 22:15.588
Any other symptoms?

22:15.656 --> 22:17.590
My glands have been a little swollen,

22:17.658 --> 22:20.794
but... but that's just because I have allergies.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.295
When did this start?

22:22.363 --> 22:23.797
Oh, I don't know.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.765
How long has this been going on?

22:25.833 --> 22:28.068
Maybe... maybe a month. Maybe six weeks.

22:28.135 --> 22:30.837
That's a long time to feel sick.

22:30.905 --> 22:32.405
Yeah, it's weird.

22:32.473 --> 22:35.308
You know, I... I, um, I had mono once when I was 16,

22:35.376 --> 22:38.678
and it... it kind of feels like that.

22:38.746 --> 22:41.214
I doubt that's it, but you
should have a blood test,

22:41.282 --> 22:43.516
Just to be sure.
Really?

22:43.584 --> 22:45.652
Do you think maybe you could save me some time

22:45.720 --> 22:48.555
and do it here?
Sure. I'll send Lois in.

22:48.622 --> 22:50.990
I'll have her bring you both a lollipop.

22:51.058 --> 22:52.759
A lollipop.

22:52.827 --> 22:55.895
A lollipop.

23:06.088 --> 23:07.055
Well...

23:07.123 --> 23:08.558
don't you two look nice?

23:09.626 --> 23:11.893
Mother, you changed your hair.

23:11.961 --> 23:13.829
Holly did it.

23:13.896 --> 23:15.732
Ida has been telling me all about your husband William.

23:16.799 --> 23:18.468
I am so sorry he's not still with us.

23:19.535 --> 23:20.670
You didn't miss much.
Mother, please.

23:20.738 --> 23:22.672
Oh, Holly's family. She might as well know.

23:22.740 --> 23:24.974
William was a cheater.

23:25.042 --> 23:26.976
He had this bottle-blonde tramp

23:27.044 --> 23:29.445
he kept across town to fornicate with...

23:29.513 --> 23:32.782
Mother, mother... piece-of-trash floozy
he picked up god knows where.

23:32.850 --> 23:35.818
You know, Nora, you're lucky
he didn't pick up some disease

23:35.886 --> 23:39.088
while he was at it.
You know what, Holly? It must be my oven.

23:39.156 --> 23:42.759
I smell that cake of yours burning again. It's burning.

23:42.826 --> 23:45.895
I don't smell anything.
Well, mother, you're wearing so much perfume,

23:45.963 --> 23:47.730
all you can do is smell yourself.

23:49.333 --> 23:50.733
Wow. It's so white.

23:50.801 --> 23:52.735
Yeah, it's like Christo's bar mitzvah. Come on.

23:52.803 --> 23:55.705
Let's get a drink before I have
to introduce you to grandma.

23:55.773 --> 23:58.174
Okay, promise me you won't say anything to your family

23:58.242 --> 24:01.177
about the whole surrogacy thing?
Absolutely. Look, I'm terrified once mom finds out,

24:01.245 --> 24:04.080
she'll want to choose the surrogate for us.
Yeah, I'm terrified once your mom finds out,

24:04.148 --> 24:06.449
she's gonna want to be the surrogate for us.

24:06.517 --> 24:08.484
Justin, where are you? Everyone's arriving.

24:08.552 --> 24:10.420
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.

24:10.487 --> 24:11.888
This is our engagement party.

24:11.955 --> 24:14.924
Can you please just get here as fast as you can?

24:16.460 --> 24:18.394
Oh, look, look, grandma.
That... that's his tooth.

24:18.462 --> 24:20.363
He has... has one little, tiny tooth,

24:20.431 --> 24:22.432
and you can really see it when he laughs.

24:22.499 --> 24:24.367
Which he does, quite a bit.
Yeah, he does, he does.

24:24.435 --> 24:26.769
Sometimes when I go in
to his room in the morning,

24:26.837 --> 24:28.304
I swear to you,

24:28.372 --> 24:31.207
he's just sitting there and he's laughing. He's adorable.

24:31.275 --> 24:34.711
Yeah. You know, say what you want,
but they do make cute babies.

24:34.778 --> 24:37.413
You know, your mother promised
to bring me a piece of cake,

24:37.481 --> 24:39.015
and she never did.

24:39.083 --> 24:41.884
Yeah, go get some cake, crazy lady.

24:43.354 --> 24:45.655
Are you okay?

24:45.723 --> 24:48.925
Yeah, I j... I... I just don't feel very good.

24:48.992 --> 24:51.260
Well, let's go.

24:51.328 --> 24:54.130
I don't think Justin's very happy with me today anyway.

24:54.198 --> 24:57.800
Yeah, well... I'll go see if I can even find him.

24:57.868 --> 24:59.802
Oh, I'm sorry I missed your wedding.

24:59.870 --> 25:04.140
I want you to know, I am 100%
in favor of gay marriage.

25:04.208 --> 25:05.775
You are?

25:05.843 --> 25:07.677
You know, those "defense of family" kooks?

25:07.745 --> 25:10.513
I mean, what is all that about?

25:10.581 --> 25:13.316
I mean, gays can't have families.
Grandma, gay people can have children.

25:13.384 --> 25:15.284
Well, apparently, you know something

25:15.352 --> 25:17.854
about plumbing I don't.
There's adoption.

25:17.921 --> 25:21.023
Oh, I didn't know they let you do that.
They do, and there's surrogacy.

25:21.091 --> 25:23.326
Kevin... and what's that?

25:23.394 --> 25:25.728
Well, uh, we find an egg donor

25:25.796 --> 25:28.698
and then we hire a surrogate to carry the baby to term.
Oh.

25:28.766 --> 25:31.667
And which one of you gets
to sleep with the egg lady?

25:40.177 --> 25:43.546
Oh, I'm sorry, all right? I know I'm late.
What happened? Are you okay?

25:43.614 --> 25:45.782
Yeah. I'm, uh, I'm great. Never better.

25:45.849 --> 25:48.785
Where were you?
I was at the library, and I just lost track of time.

25:48.852 --> 25:50.753
No, I'm sorry. You lose track of time

25:50.821 --> 25:52.789
on a Sunday when you're hanging out,

25:52.856 --> 25:56.359
not on the day of your engagement party.
Okay, what, there are rules for when I can

25:56.427 --> 25:59.195
lose track of time now?
Is that what you're saying?
What is going on with you?

25:59.263 --> 26:01.330
Nothing. Just... nothing.
Justin, what is going on?

26:01.398 --> 26:04.333
You have to cut me some slack,
okay? Because you have no idea

26:04.401 --> 26:07.336
how much pressure I'm under right now.

26:07.404 --> 26:09.705
Holly, what are you doing?

26:09.773 --> 26:11.441
Justin arrived.

26:11.508 --> 26:13.910
And I'm already disappointing everyone...
Yeah, so I hear.

26:13.377 --> 26:15.378
This is the first time I've heard about this.

26:15.446 --> 26:17.180
How do you expect me to understand

26:17.248 --> 26:19.349
what kind of pressure you're under

26:19.417 --> 26:21.952
if you don't talk to me about it?
Okay, you want to know?

26:22.019 --> 26:24.955
Yes, I want to know.
You want to know? I have three tests on Monday.

26:25.022 --> 26:27.991
If I don't get at least a B in all of them,

26:28.059 --> 26:29.993
I can pretty much kiss being a doctor goodbye.

26:30.061 --> 26:31.995
If I'm lucky, I'll get to clean the doctor's pools.

26:32.063 --> 26:33.930
And you know what? I know. I know how important

26:33.998 --> 26:36.399
this wedding a engagement extravaganza is to you,

26:36.467 --> 26:39.402
but if you want me to be that little plastic guy

26:39.470 --> 26:42.472
on top of the cake, this isn't gonna work for me.
What? Wait, wait, wait. So now this wedding is my idea?

26:42.540 --> 26:44.841
Oh, my God, Rebecca. Are you serious?
That is so unfair, Justin.

26:45.509 --> 26:48.377
If you don't think this is
gonna work, don't blame me.
This is insane.
This is insane.

26:48.445 --> 26:50.947
I don't know what I was thinking.
What were you thinking?

26:51.014 --> 26:52.949
I was thinking I could handle
medical school, get married

26:53.016 --> 26:55.918
and be married to you without my life going into flames.

26:55.986 --> 26:59.222
But you know what? I was wrong.
What are they yelling about?
The whole party can hear them.

26:59.289 --> 27:01.824
Can't understand...
Okay, okay, okay, change of plans.

27:01.892 --> 27:04.227
Nora, you go inside, you tell them to kiss and make up

27:04.294 --> 27:06.429
and get their butts outside.
Outside?

27:06.497 --> 27:08.397
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gifts outside, everybody.

27:08.465 --> 27:10.399
Come on, everybody. Gifts outside. Let's go.

27:10.467 --> 27:13.169
Come on, come on, come on.
Why are we doing gifts outside?

27:13.237 --> 27:15.137
Scotty, Saul, grandma.

27:15.205 --> 27:17.573
Do you want me to just go out there and say,

27:17.641 --> 27:19.942
"I'm s... I'm sorry, my fiance had a little freak-out.

27:20.010 --> 27:22.245
Be sure to try the salmon"?
I heard the salmon's great.

27:22.312 --> 27:25.481
Excuse me. I don't know what
you're arguing about, but...
Not now, mom.

27:25.549 --> 27:27.517
Yes, now. Everyone is outside waiting for you.

27:27.584 --> 27:30.820
So you have to pull it together,
and we have to go out there.

27:30.888 --> 27:33.356
Mom, can you just give us,
like, one... like, one minute?

27:33.423 --> 27:35.391
Sorry, no.

27:37.694 --> 27:40.129
What's the hold up?

27:40.197 --> 27:41.964
Oh, they're coming. They're coming.

27:42.032 --> 27:44.967
What's that?
Oh, it's this really cute
little picture frame I got them.

27:45.035 --> 27:46.702
I had it engraved.

27:46.770 --> 27:49.839
Uh, I'd hide that if I were you.

27:56.113 --> 27:58.014
Oh, there they are.

27:58.081 --> 28:01.117
Rebecca and Justin...

28:01.184 --> 28:03.419
happy engagement from me and David.

28:03.487 --> 28:04.620
Whoo.

28:04.688 --> 28:06.155
What?

28:07.858 --> 28:09.926
Congratulations.

28:09.993 --> 28:11.761
Oh, yeah. I love you both.
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

28:11.828 --> 28:14.363
Mwah.
Oh, my God, mom.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.799
Mom, check this... did you see? She got us a car.

28:16.867 --> 28:19.101
Wow. Wow. You... got them a car.

28:19.169 --> 28:22.138
Holly, that's so generous of you.

28:22.205 --> 28:24.707
Too generous.
Well, they deserve it.

28:24.775 --> 28:28.277
Yes, they deserve it. I thought the party was your gift.

28:28.345 --> 28:31.213
I thought we decided not to get them anything else.
Holly, don't. Don't.

28:31.281 --> 28:34.717
You broke the agreement.
I got them a picture frame.

28:34.785 --> 28:37.420
Well, I find it interesting that you have

28:37.487 --> 28:39.889
completely forgotten that you broke the rules first.

28:39.957 --> 28:41.457
How did I break the rules?

28:41.525 --> 28:44.560
You got them a diamond ring!
The ring was my grandmother's.

28:44.628 --> 28:46.662
I gave it to Justin. He gave it to Rebecca.

28:46.730 --> 28:49.031
You know, it's amazing how you always find the loophole

28:49.099 --> 28:52.168
that you can crawl through, Nora.
You know, I'd like to talk to you.

28:52.235 --> 28:54.203
Mom, I'm not gonna drive the car, all right?

28:54.271 --> 28:55.705
It'll be Rebecca's, okay?

28:55.772 --> 28:57.773
I'm fine. It's a lovely car,

28:57.841 --> 29:00.743
and clearly, holly has the money to pay for it.
Yes, Holly has the money to pay for it.

29:00.811 --> 29:03.646
Holly, do you want to tell my mother how you
happen to have the money to pay for it?

29:03.714 --> 29:06.616
She earned it, Nora. She's the president of Ojai Foods.

29:06.683 --> 29:08.651
Yes, she is the president of Ojai Foods.

29:08.719 --> 29:10.152
Tell my mother

29:10.220 --> 29:12.989
how you happened to become the president
of Ojai Foods. How'd that happen, Holly?

29:13.056 --> 29:16.392
Okay. I am the tramp that William was fornicating with.

29:16.460 --> 29:18.394
I am the floozy.

29:18.462 --> 29:22.465
And I was so good at it, that
he gave me an endowment.

29:22.532 --> 29:24.400
Okay, that... that's it. Justin, you were right.

29:24.468 --> 29:27.136
I'm going home. Thank you all very much for coming.
Oh, Rebecca!

29:27.204 --> 29:29.572
Fine with me, Rebecca.
Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.

29:29.640 --> 29:31.841
No, Justin.... she's... wait a minute.

29:31.908 --> 29:34.410
Come on, grandma. Let's...

29:34.478 --> 29:35.945
Is the party over?

29:36.013 --> 29:38.481
Yeah. Yeah, it's over.

29:41.466 --> 29:44.301
Well, it's a good thing you're calling this off.

29:44.369 --> 29:46.937
That girl could be your sister.
No, mother, they are not brother and sister. Come on.

29:47.005 --> 29:49.340
Oh, mother, for God sakes.
Do you think I would approve

29:49.407 --> 29:52.943
of this wedding if they were?
Nora, I am still trying to digest the fact

29:53.011 --> 29:56.814
That you are hosting a party with your husband's mistress.
Mother, shut up.

29:58.450 --> 30:00.451
Excuse me?
You heard me, mother. I said shut up.

30:00.518 --> 30:02.920
You know what? It is a pretty night.

30:02.988 --> 30:05.456
I was thinking about taking a walk around the pool.

30:05.523 --> 30:08.559
Do you want to come with me?
Why, yes. That would be lovely.

30:08.627 --> 30:12.129
Nora... I don't appreciate being talked to like this.

30:15.800 --> 30:18.502
All right. Let's all get back to Justin.

30:18.570 --> 30:21.405
Or not.
Justin, listen to me.

30:21.473 --> 30:24.541
If your grades are as bad as you say they are,

30:24.609 --> 30:26.510
then you have to change something.

30:26.578 --> 30:29.446
You have to do whatever
you need to do to stay focused.

30:29.514 --> 30:32.049
If you have too much gong on in your life right now,

30:32.117 --> 30:35.352
then you have to choose what's most important.
Yes, that's right, Justin.

30:35.420 --> 30:38.389
Maybe you should postpone
the wedding for a few months.
Rebecca won't go for that, all right?

30:38.456 --> 30:41.091
She... she'd break up with me.
I think she already did that.

30:41.159 --> 30:44.428
No, she didn't. And, Justin, I know you love Rebecca.

30:44.496 --> 30:46.463
I love Rebecca. But she's not going anywhere.

30:46.531 --> 30:49.199
And right now, you're in med school.

30:49.267 --> 30:51.302
Who cares if Robert pulled strings to get you in?

30:51.369 --> 30:53.671
You're in. And this is a chance
that won't come around again.

30:53.738 --> 30:56.106
I know that, mom. And every single person here

30:56.174 --> 30:58.542
has taken their opportunity
to tell me not to blow it.

30:58.610 --> 31:01.645
So thanks for bringing that up. I appreciate it.

31:05.850 --> 31:08.152
Maybe I shouldn't have bought the car.

31:08.219 --> 31:10.654
Mom, this is not about the car. This is about Justin.

31:10.722 --> 31:13.757
Well, if he made you this upset,
why don't we go over there

31:13.825 --> 31:16.427
and pick up your things
and bring them back here?
Oh, my God.

31:16.494 --> 31:18.262
David, that's not helping.

31:18.330 --> 31:19.596
Sweetie...

31:19.664 --> 31:22.099
maybe it's not the end of the world

31:22.167 --> 31:24.802
that Justin wants to postpone the wedding.

31:24.869 --> 31:26.437
What are you saying?

31:26.504 --> 31:28.205
He's studying night and day.

31:28.273 --> 31:31.275
He's commuting so that he
can see you. He's overwhelmed.
Wait.

31:31.343 --> 31:34.511
And maybe you're a little overwhelmed, too.
So now you're on Justin's side?

31:34.579 --> 31:36.947
No, all I'm saying is, maybe this is not

31:37.015 --> 31:40.250
the perfect time to plan a wedding.
Well, when is the perfect time,

31:40.318 --> 31:42.252
in four years when he graduates,

31:42.320 --> 31:45.689
when he's done his residency?
Maybe it won't be that long.
Justin had a big setback.

31:45.757 --> 31:48.959
Maybe he just needs some time
to regain faith in himself.

31:49.027 --> 31:51.895
Well, what about having faith in me?

31:51.963 --> 31:54.365
I've always been there for him.
Yeah, but has he been there for you?

31:55.432 --> 31:57.601
Okay, you know what? I've gotta go home.
What are you gonna say to him?

31:57.669 --> 31:59.571
I don't know, dad. I...
Sweetie, why don't you just spend the night?

31:59.638 --> 32:01.874
Then we can talk about it in the morning.
Mom, you know what? I... I just...

32:01.875 --> 32:03.844
I feel like I need to figure this out on my own, okay?

32:13.384 --> 32:14.617
Justin.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.287
You know what I'm doing right now?

32:18.355 --> 32:19.889
What?

32:19.957 --> 32:21.924
I'm plunking out random notes

32:21.992 --> 32:24.527
cause I don't know how to play the piano,

32:24.595 --> 32:26.529
because I never finished the piano lessons

32:26.597 --> 32:28.531
you bought when I was 9.

32:28.599 --> 32:31.534
Well, you weren't into music. You were into baseball.

32:31.602 --> 32:34.537
I quit piano. And eventually, I quit the baseball team.

32:34.605 --> 32:36.873
I was gonna quit that summer job at Ojai,

32:36.940 --> 32:38.841
but dad fired me first.

32:38.909 --> 32:41.778
And, I, uh, I quit college.

32:41.845 --> 32:44.680
That's what I do, mom. I, uh, I quit.

32:44.748 --> 32:48.084
So you of all people are entitled

32:48.152 --> 32:50.086
to doubt whether I'm gonna be able

32:50.154 --> 32:53.356
to finish medical school or not.
I don't doubt you.

32:53.424 --> 32:56.092
Oh, you don't?

32:56.160 --> 32:57.560
I'm just worried

32:57.628 --> 32:59.896
that you're gonna somehow sabotage yourself

32:59.963 --> 33:03.800
by trying to do so much.  I just want you...
I hate when you say that.

33:03.867 --> 33:06.736
I need you to believe in me, e... especially now.

33:06.804 --> 33:09.572
I am so scared of disappointing you.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.908
No matter how old I get,

33:11.975 --> 33:14.911
I feel like I'm this kid sitting
here at the piano messing up

33:14.978 --> 33:18.414
with my mom frowning at me in the doorway.

33:23.053 --> 33:25.054
Justin...

33:25.122 --> 33:26.989
when you were that little boy,

33:27.057 --> 33:29.892
you were bored or distracted or rebellious,

33:29.960 --> 33:32.662
but that was then and this is now.

33:32.729 --> 33:35.631
And you are working so hard on so many things.

33:35.699 --> 33:38.601
And you're trying not to...
not to disappoint Rebecca

33:38.669 --> 33:40.770
and not to let me down.

33:40.838 --> 33:42.772
What about you? What do you really want?

33:42.840 --> 33:45.274
And if what you want is to be a doctor,

33:45.342 --> 33:46.709
then I don't think

33:46.777 --> 33:49.645
there's anyone or anything that can stop you.

33:49.713 --> 33:52.782
Really?

33:52.850 --> 33:54.884
Really.

33:57.020 --> 33:58.955
Well, I guess it's a good thing

33:59.022 --> 34:00.923
they don't send you my med school grades.

34:00.991 --> 34:03.259
No more frowning.

34:03.327 --> 34:05.928
Oh, God. Was I really like that?

34:05.996 --> 34:07.897
I'm just like my mother.

34:07.965 --> 34:10.266
I never wanted to be like my mother.

34:10.333 --> 34:12.235
I never wanted to make you feel

34:12.302 --> 34:14.303
like you were somehow
a disappointment to me.

34:14.371 --> 34:16.405
No, mom. You're not... you're not like grandma.

34:16.473 --> 34:18.373
You're not even close.

34:18.442 --> 34:20.476
Really?

34:20.543 --> 34:23.279
Really.

34:35.359 --> 34:36.458
Hey.

34:36.527 --> 34:37.960
Hi.

34:38.027 --> 34:40.996
I wasn't sure you were gonna be here.

34:41.063 --> 34:44.132
Yeah. Neither was I.

34:44.201 --> 34:46.636
We're, uh, we're both here.

34:46.703 --> 34:49.172
That's a... that's a good sign, right?

34:49.239 --> 34:51.072
Yeah.

34:53.377 --> 34:56.379
Justin... I want to help you.

34:56.446 --> 34:59.916
And I don't like seeing you
under all of this pressure.

34:59.983 --> 35:01.884
And I certainly don't... want to add to it.

35:01.952 --> 35:04.320
So...

35:04.388 --> 35:06.689
do what you need to do.

35:06.757 --> 35:10.026
I mean, if you need to move out,

35:10.093 --> 35:12.528
if you need to call off the wedding...
No, no, no, no, no.

35:12.596 --> 35:15.464
Rebecca, I don't want to call
off the wedding. I don't. Okay?

35:15.532 --> 35:17.466
Look, e... everybody keeps telling me,

35:17.534 --> 35:20.303
in order to get through this,
I need to believe in myself.

35:20.370 --> 35:22.305
And you know what? They're right.

35:22.372 --> 35:24.473
And what I need from you...

35:24.541 --> 35:26.475
is, um... you know,

35:26.543 --> 35:28.344
maybe sometime in the middle of the night,

35:28.412 --> 35:30.346
I'm... I'm gonna wake up with doubts

35:30.414 --> 35:32.481
and... and freak out.

35:32.549 --> 35:35.017
And I just need to be able to turn to you

35:35.085 --> 35:37.019
and know that you believe in me

35:37.087 --> 35:38.521
I do believe in you.

35:38.589 --> 35:40.923
I've always believed you could do this.

35:40.991 --> 35:43.292
You're right. I know that.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.127
Do you?

35:45.195 --> 35:47.530
I do. I... I really do.

35:47.598 --> 35:49.198
Good.

35:53.904 --> 35:55.171
So...

35:55.239 --> 35:56.639
so how about this?

35:56.707 --> 36:00.109
How about tomorrow we have
a picnic at Zuma beach?

36:00.177 --> 36:02.979
You don't have to take me on a picnic.

36:03.046 --> 36:05.014
I want to take you on a picnic.

36:05.082 --> 36:06.916
I mean, come on. We'll... we'll pack some food.

36:06.984 --> 36:09.719
And if... if I have to study, I might as well study

36:09.786 --> 36:11.754
in a beautiful place with a beautiful girl.

36:11.822 --> 36:14.590
I'm gonna quiz you relentlessly.
I hope you do.

36:14.658 --> 36:18.394
I need all the help I can get.

36:18.462 --> 36:20.963
I love you.

36:21.031 --> 36:23.032
I love you, too.

36:37.381 --> 36:39.815
Kitty, hi.
This is Dr. Gibson.

36:39.883 --> 36:42.785
Give me a call as soon as you get this, okay?

36:42.853 --> 36:44.803
Just tell my answering service
I'm expecting your call.

36:46.104 --> 36:47.104
This sounded important.

36:49.105 --> 36:52.405
Um, no. She's just calling about following up.

36:52.406 --> 36:54.906
You know... you know that. Evan had a fever so...

36:57.007 --> 37:00.507
Ok, alright. I've got some work to catch up on.

37:00.508 --> 37:01.908
Good night.
Good night.

37:13.809 --> 37:16.709
Yes, hi. I'm calling for Doctor Gibson.

37:17.310 --> 37:18.710
It's Kitty McCallister.

37:19.311 --> 37:22.711
Yes, yes. She's expecting my call.

37:30.529 --> 37:32.932
How's "Assembling a child" by Tolstoy?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.568
Okay, listen to this egg donor contract.

37:35.636 --> 37:39.939
"Except as set forth in section 13.3 below,

37:40.007 --> 37:42.675
intended parents' payment to ovocyte donor"...

37:42.743 --> 37:45.712
I... I can't understand a word of this.

37:45.779 --> 37:47.180
You don't have to.

37:47.247 --> 37:48.516
That's the advantage of being married to a lawyer.

37:48.584 --> 37:50.785
Yeah, well, it's not just the fine print

37:50.853 --> 37:52.653
I'm worried about.

37:55.021 --> 37:57.556
Sometimes in contract negotiations,

37:57.564 --> 37:58.458
it doesn't matter what you do,

37:58.526 --> 38:00.561
One party will always find something wrong.

38:00.628 --> 38:02.529
And those deals never get done.

38:03.997 --> 38:07.299
But it has nothing to do with the fine print.

38:07.367 --> 38:09.435
Usually, someone has cold feet.

38:09.502 --> 38:12.571
So you have to tell me if that's what you're feeling.

38:12.639 --> 38:15.474
Okay.

38:15.542 --> 38:17.876
The more real this gets,

38:17.944 --> 38:21.313
the more scared... I become.

38:21.381 --> 38:23.249
That's how I'm feeling.

38:23.316 --> 38:26.418
You'd... you'd be crazy not to be a little scared.

38:26.486 --> 38:29.121
I am not a little scared, Kevin.

38:31.291 --> 38:34.560
I don't want to move forward with this until I'm sure.

38:36.696 --> 38:38.197
I understand.

38:38.265 --> 38:39.632
Do you?

38:39.699 --> 38:42.167
Yeah. Well... I spent two years...

38:43.737 --> 38:46.272
being scared of committing to us, to you.

38:46.339 --> 38:48.307
So...

38:48.375 --> 38:50.776
it's my turn to wait.

38:57.450 --> 39:00.052
Okay, I'm setting our new navigation

39:00.120 --> 39:03.689
to take us to the beach.
I already know how to get to the beach, Justin.

39:03.757 --> 39:06.458
Oh, look at you, all manly, refusing to take directions.
Well...

39:06.526 --> 39:08.460
And I made the sandwiches.

39:08.528 --> 39:11.463
It's like a complete role reversal.
Let's just hope I'm a better driver

39:11.531 --> 39:13.632
than you are a sandwich maker.

39:13.700 --> 39:14.601
How have you been feeling lately?

39:14.669 --> 39:16.169
Any colds, flu?

39:16.237 --> 39:17.637
No, no.

39:17.705 --> 39:19.606
Just a... a low-grade fever on and off

39:19.674 --> 39:21.107
and a little fatigue.

39:21.175 --> 39:23.643
Mm-hmm. You've got some
enlarged nods here and there.

39:23.711 --> 39:25.578
But this one is big enough,

39:25.646 --> 39:27.547
I'd like to take a closer look.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.082
It's not bad.

39:29.150 --> 39:32.252
I just use a needle to take out a few cells.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.255
I can do it here in the office.

39:33.322 --> 39:38.558
I'd like to do it right away if you've got the time.
Well, sure. Sure.

39:38.626 --> 39:42.228
What... what exactly are you looking for in the cells?

39:42.296 --> 39:42.997
You know what? Let's not jump ahead.

39:43.365 --> 39:48.834
I'll see you in a few minutes.
I have a... a... I have a baby boy at home.

39:48.902 --> 39:51.839
I understand. I'll send Gina in to get you ready.

40:04.184 --> 40:05.651
Goodbye, Nora.

40:05.719 --> 40:07.720
It's been enlightening, as always.

40:07.788 --> 40:11.190
Oh, mother, please. Can't I talk to you?

40:11.258 --> 40:14.193
No, the taxi will be here in a minute.
Look, I would like to apologize.

40:14.261 --> 40:16.228
I... I came to your room last night,

40:16.296 --> 40:19.098
but all the lights were out.
I took a pill.

40:19.166 --> 40:21.333
I have trouble sleeping when things are calm,

40:21.401 --> 40:23.202
so you can imagine.

40:23.270 --> 40:24.904
Well, I have trouble sleeping, too.

40:24.971 --> 40:26.872
Maybe I inherited that from you.

40:26.940 --> 40:29.108
Something else that's my fault.

40:29.176 --> 40:31.010
That's not what I meant, honestly.

40:31.078 --> 40:32.178
Oh.

40:32.245 --> 40:34.613
Mother, I just... I've been so out of it.

40:34.681 --> 40:37.083
I've been anxious and... and worried about my kids.

40:37.150 --> 40:39.085
I don't... I don't know why.

40:39.152 --> 40:42.555
I... maybe I just took that out on you.

40:42.622 --> 40:44.824
Oh.

40:44.891 --> 40:47.359
Mother, from the minute my kids were born,

40:47.427 --> 40:49.795
all I did was worry about them.

40:49.863 --> 40:51.964
Hey, you know, this is gonna be

40:52.032 --> 40:54.066
my ring's first picnic?

40:54.134 --> 40:57.536
I thought, surely this will stop when they get older.

40:57.604 --> 40:59.038
But no.

40:59.106 --> 41:03.409
What I worry about has changed, but... I'm still worrying.

41:03.477 --> 41:05.478
I'm gonna need you to stay very still.

41:05.545 --> 41:06.912
Okay.

41:06.980 --> 41:10.483
And what good has all this worrying done?

41:10.550 --> 41:11.984
None

41:12.052 --> 41:13.752
With or without it,

41:13.820 --> 41:16.388
my kids are doing just fine.

41:16.456 --> 41:18.324
What did you make?

41:18.391 --> 41:20.526
What did I make? Oh, I happened to make your favorite.

41:20.594 --> 41:22.461
They're happy

41:22.529 --> 41:24.096
And they're fine.

41:24.164 --> 41:27.333
You're gonna feel a little stick.

41:33.106 --> 41:34.740
I just need to learn to relax.

41:40.347 --> 41:41.413
Rebecca!

41:44.484 --> 41:45.818
I deserve to be happy.

41:50.790 --> 41:53.259
Oh, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

41:53.326 --> 41:56.495
I just wanted to talk to the pathologist.

41:59.733 --> 42:01.167
Kitty...

42:01.234 --> 42:03.102
It's, um, not good news.
