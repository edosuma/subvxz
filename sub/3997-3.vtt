00:08.512 --> 00:09.291
Hey.

00:09.292 --> 00:12.016
You're a big girl. You can watch
The Walking Dead alone.

00:12.017 --> 00:13.060
Sam booty-called me.

00:13.061 --> 00:14.088
Ooh, Sam, he's so hot.

00:14.089 --> 00:16.062
- I don't care. Good night.
- Don't!

00:16.065 --> 00:18.029
- What?
- I need your help.

00:18.030 --> 00:20.150
I don't know what to do.
I'm terrible at casual sex.

00:20.151 --> 00:22.009
I left him in there with crayons

00:22.010 --> 00:23.050
and paper, like he's a kid

00:23.051 --> 00:24.931
in a restaurant,
and I told him I had to check

00:24.932 --> 00:27.292
- my fantasy football.
- You don't even know what that is.

00:27.293 --> 00:29.082
No, sir, I do not know what that is.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.011
I panicked. Help me.

00:31.012 --> 00:33.041
Look, you can't separate
your feelings from sex?

00:33.042 --> 00:35.028
So what? You're a girl.

00:35.029 --> 00:37.032
I deserve to have a shorty
on the side.

00:37.033 --> 00:39.393
Okay, a shorty is not... that's
the wrong use of "shorty."

00:39.394 --> 00:40.016
(Door opens)

00:40.017 --> 00:42.025
- Hey, I drew a cat.
- Uh, sorry, man.

00:42.026 --> 00:44.226
She's, uh, checking her
fantasy football 'cause she...

00:44.227 --> 00:46.227
Yeah, I'm not gonna do this,
so I-I don't even...

00:46.228 --> 00:49.079

00:55.588 --> 00:58.016
WINSTON: Are we gonna
talk about it?

00:58.017 --> 00:59.075
Talk about what, Winston?

00:59.076 --> 01:02.032
The belt, Schmidt.
Please explain the belt.

01:02.033 --> 01:04.081
It's after Labor Day.
I'm wearing whales.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.483
- The dumbest thing ever.
- NICK: You look like the bad guy

01:06.484 --> 01:08.045
in an '80s high school movie.

01:08.046 --> 01:10.820
I'll have you guys know
that Kanye wore this belt, okay?

01:10.821 --> 01:12.821
- Let me just say that
word one more time: Kanye.

01:12.822 --> 01:13.062
Kanye?

01:13.063 --> 01:14.503
Yeah, and he looked beautiful in it.

01:14.504 --> 01:15.897
His whole midsection lit up.

01:15.898 --> 01:17.258
What is your obsession with Kanye?

01:17.259 --> 01:19.019
Befriending Kanye
is the most efficient way

01:19.020 --> 01:20.180
for me to jump social strata.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.020
Now all I have to do is meet him,

01:22.021 --> 01:23.781
and then dazzle him
to the point that we're

01:23.782 --> 01:25.142
each other's last call before bed.

01:25.143 --> 01:26.044
"Yo, what up, K?

01:26.045 --> 01:27.285
"Yeah, I'm just going to sleep.

01:27.286 --> 01:28.924
"You watching Fallon?

01:28.925 --> 01:31.125
- "That brother's crazy."
- WINSTON: Hey, Tagg Romney.

01:31.126 --> 01:33.006
You know if your dad's
gonna win the election?

01:33.007 --> 01:34.607
(Laughing): He does
look like a Romney.

01:34.608 --> 01:35.848
Telling me that I look like one

01:35.849 --> 01:37.289
of the most handsome men in politics

01:37.290 --> 01:38.690
does not hurt my feelings, Winston.

01:38.691 --> 01:41.003
Last night was horrible.

01:41.004 --> 01:42.028
Sam came over,

01:42.029 --> 01:44.023
we tried to make out, I stopped it,

01:44.024 --> 01:45.025
and then we just

01:45.026 --> 01:46.057
laid there

01:46.058 --> 01:50.011
like two old couple
in The Notebook waiting to die.

01:50.012 --> 01:52.092
Jess, I get it... you're
the type of person that...

01:52.093 --> 01:54.041
you need to ease
into these kind of things.

01:54.042 --> 01:56.004
- Let us take you out tonight, okay?
- Uh-uh.

01:56.005 --> 01:57.605
And that way, you...
you can feel like,

01:57.606 --> 01:59.206
you know, you're going
on a date first.

01:59.207 --> 02:00.695
Yes! Like we're all dating

02:00.696 --> 02:02.096
in a large, nonsexual friend group.

02:02.097 --> 02:04.087
My nightmare.
Have fun. I'm out.

02:04.088 --> 02:06.053
Come on, Nick. Please?

02:06.054 --> 02:07.214
Why are you doing this, Jess?

02:07.215 --> 02:09.086
Why don't you just date a guy that...

02:09.088 --> 02:11.015
I don't know...
you like?

02:11.017 --> 02:12.027
This is good for me.

02:12.028 --> 02:13.348
I always jump into relationships.

02:13.349 --> 02:15.016
Plus, Sam's not the kind of guy

02:15.017 --> 02:17.070
you spend Saturdays
in your sweatpants with.

02:17.071 --> 02:18.936
He's the kind of guy...

02:18.937 --> 02:19.777
(Quietly):
You bone.

02:19.778 --> 02:22.058
I can't help. I'm at a crucial
point in my zombie novel.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.029
- You selfish bastard.
- I'm not a selfish bastard.

02:24.030 --> 02:25.750
I just have to... I
have to get through...

02:25.751 --> 02:26.751
You're a selfish bastard.

02:26.752 --> 02:28.472
I'm so sick of this
zombie novel nonsense.

02:28.473 --> 02:29.033
Not nonsense.

02:29.034 --> 02:30.998
Friends help friends
have meaningless sex, okay?

02:30.999 --> 02:32.021
Now, you're going.

02:32.022 --> 02:34.000
- End of story.
- You got it.

02:34.003 --> 02:36.049
Where are you, Schmidt?
This place is fancy,

02:36.050 --> 02:38.078
and I don't know which fork
to kill myself with.

02:38.079 --> 02:41.024
I got to bail!
Kanye's at this club tonight.

02:41.025 --> 02:43.037
What are you talking about?
This was your idea.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.849
Can't miss this, Nick.
I got the belt on.

02:44.850 --> 02:47.010
I took Winston with me
to prove that I can be friends

02:47.011 --> 02:48.731
with black people,
even oddly shaped ones.

02:48.732 --> 02:49.612
Just shut up, Schmidt!

02:49.613 --> 02:51.028
Shut up! This is ridiculous.

02:51.029 --> 02:52.349
I'm leaving right now.
Good-bye.

02:54.029 --> 02:55.999
Whoa. (Chuckles)

02:56.000 --> 02:58.295
Wow. I forgot what you look like

02:58.296 --> 03:00.096
when you're not dressed
like the Loft Troll.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.083
- Pardon?
- Sorry, I didn't...

03:02.086 --> 03:07.041
What I mean to say is
you look va-va-va-vavooms!

03:07.042 --> 03:09.050
- (Snickers)
- Hello, nurse!

03:09.053 --> 03:12.597
Hubba-bubba! Meow! Zing!
You can stop me at any time.

03:12.598 --> 03:14.038
- Are the guys coming, or...?
- No.

03:14.039 --> 03:16.119
It's just us... they bailed...
so if you want to go

03:16.120 --> 03:18.280
back to the loft, or we can both
go back to the loft.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.441
- We're already here.
- But we're already here, so...

03:21.096 --> 03:23.057
Can I get you a chair, milady?

03:23.058 --> 03:25.000
- So weird.
- Yeah.

03:25.001 --> 03:26.281
(Loud, gruff voice):
Loft Troll

03:26.282 --> 03:28.053
not used to fancy gentleman!

03:28.054 --> 03:30.062
- Shut up.
- That was so loud.

03:30.063 --> 03:31.423
(Chuckling):
Why are you yelling?

03:31.424 --> 03:32.088
(Chuckles)

03:33.189 --> 03:34.488
On the list.

03:36.579 --> 03:39.545
Winston! You've been staring at
this girl for five minutes.

03:39.546 --> 03:40.853
I hope you're checking her out.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.214
Otherwise, you're a serial killer,

03:42.215 --> 03:43.255
which would explain a lot.

03:43.256 --> 03:44.096
No. Checking her out?

03:44.097 --> 03:46.050
- No, dude, I'm in a relationship.
- I know.

03:46.053 --> 03:48.078
Like, happily.
Shelby, we're...

03:48.079 --> 03:50.078
Shelby and I haven't
had sex in three weeks.

03:50.079 --> 03:52.062
- For real?
- We're in a bit of a rut.

03:54.021 --> 03:57.033
Not now. I have to
go to the bathroom.

04:02.038 --> 04:03.596
- I'm cheating on Shelby.
- What?

04:03.599 --> 04:05.772
- No, no, in my mind.
- In your mind...?

04:05.773 --> 04:07.373
I'm cheating on
Shelby in my mind, man.

04:07.374 --> 04:08.054
So what? So what?

04:08.055 --> 04:10.295
What do you mean, "So what?"
I'm doing it all the time.

04:10.296 --> 04:12.496
Like, I'm doing it a lot.
I can't control myself, man.

04:12.497 --> 04:14.617
Listen, everybody does it
every minute all the time.

04:14.618 --> 04:16.418
How do you think I get
through the day, man?

04:16.418 --> 04:18.003
(Chuckles) Okay. Wow.

04:18.004 --> 04:20.999
Um, in that case...

04:21.000 --> 04:24.074
Hey, lady, can I introduce you to...

04:24.075 --> 04:27.016
this lady?

04:27.017 --> 04:29.177
- This place is crazy expensive.
- Schmidt picked it.

04:29.178 --> 04:31.588
I can afford the valet
charge and the "Add onions."

04:32.089 --> 04:36.587
Then you'll be happy to meet
my little Scottish friend.

04:36.588 --> 04:40.507
You unexpected genius.

04:40.508 --> 04:41.828
- Is that whiskey?
- White wine.

04:41.829 --> 04:43.553
White wine?!

04:43.554 --> 04:45.588
Why would you do wine?

04:47.525 --> 04:50.517
- Nope.
- All right, my man.

04:50.518 --> 04:51.758
- Not gonna happen.
- Schmidt?

04:51.759 --> 04:53.057
It's the belt, man.

04:53.058 --> 04:54.818
- Take off the belt.
- Okay, the only thing

04:54.819 --> 04:56.659
I know in this world
is this belt is amazing.

04:56.660 --> 04:58.540
Look, if you're gonna
wear that thing, just...

04:58.541 --> 05:00.621
- just make it work for us, okay?
- You got a plan?

05:00.622 --> 05:02.233
Yeah, I got a plan, of course.

05:02.234 --> 05:03.554
All right, go talk to your peeps.

05:03.555 --> 05:06.035
- It's not my peeps.
- It's your peeps, man. Go talk to them.

05:06.038 --> 05:08.118
- Don't say... don't do this.
- Yeah, man, come on.

05:08.119 --> 05:09.759
- I mean, come on. Really?
- Yeah, word.

05:10.567 --> 05:12.511
We got Tagg Romney out here.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.472
We're gonna need you
to sweep the the perimeter.

05:14.473 --> 05:16.520
What the hell you talking about?

05:16.521 --> 05:18.549
Tagg Romney.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.553
Romney. Like,
Mitt Romney's your dad?

05:20.554 --> 05:21.794
Let's get America back to work.

05:23.588 --> 05:27.517
- Here's the thermos.
- Thanks.

05:27.518 --> 05:28.718
You know, the drunker you get,

05:28.719 --> 05:30.639
the more obvious you're being
with the thermos.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.578
"Thermose?" "Thermas?"

05:32.579 --> 05:34.516
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

05:34.517 --> 05:35.519
What's a "thermoos?"

05:35.520 --> 05:36.880
That one right there in your hand.

05:36.881 --> 05:39.541
Oh, the "thermase?"
(Chuckles)

05:39.542 --> 05:41.550
- This is fun.
- This is really fun.

05:41.553 --> 05:43.532
(Cell phone ringing)

05:43.533 --> 05:44.566
It's Sam.

05:44.567 --> 05:47.049
He's done with work,
and he wants to "hang out."

05:47.050 --> 05:49.774
He's got a job, too?
Poke a hole in that condom.

05:50.075 --> 05:52.016
Thank you, Nick.

05:52.017 --> 05:54.498
I now feel ready
to have meaningless sex.

05:54.499 --> 05:56.979
- I do what I can, so...
- Hey, do you need money for the...?

05:56.980 --> 05:58.460
Half the soup? No,
I think I got it.

05:58.461 --> 05:59.578
Loft Troll eats fancy soup.

05:59.579 --> 06:01.529
Get out of here, would you?

06:02.546 --> 06:03.558
Go have fun.

06:07.012 --> 06:09.049
Excuse me.

06:09.050 --> 06:11.057
Can I get an ice bucket
for this bad boy?

06:11.058 --> 06:14.096
And more than your normal amount
'cause this is a thermos, so...

06:17.017 --> 06:18.096
(Sighs)

06:22.033 --> 06:24.066
♪ ♪

06:24.067 --> 06:27.016
WINSTON:
Ah...

06:27.017 --> 06:28.137
I see what we're doing here.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.054
We're stalking your
ex-girlfriend.

06:30.055 --> 06:32.057
Oh, is Cece here?

06:32.058 --> 06:34.032
Schmidt.

06:34.033 --> 06:36.032
Cece, what up?

06:36.033 --> 06:37.077
So, where's, uh, Blobby?

06:37.078 --> 06:39.071
Where's... where's Blobby?
Where's that dude?

06:39.072 --> 06:42.061
Oh, you mean my boyfriend?
His name's Robby.

06:42.062 --> 06:46.007
Excuse me. My friend is too
embarrassed to come over here,

06:46.008 --> 06:48.037
but she said she heard
from someone in line

06:48.038 --> 06:50.033
- that you're a Romney.
- (Cece laughs)

06:50.036 --> 06:52.008
- I am...
- She's right over there.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.092
Oh, yeah, I'm a Romney.

06:54.093 --> 06:56.071
- Hell, yeah, I'm a Romney.
- CECE: Oh, come on!

06:56.074 --> 06:58.394
Security, remove the threat.
Remove the threat. Code red.

06:58.395 --> 06:59.275
Is that how bad it is?

06:59.276 --> 07:00.516
Right this way, ma'am. Come on!

07:00.517 --> 07:02.375
Hey, that woman is stupid
enough to believe...

07:02.376 --> 07:04.456
Remove the obstruction, please.
Code red. Code red.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.197
Winston, I thought
you were better than this.

07:06.198 --> 07:07.118
SCHMIDT:
I'm so sorry.

07:07.119 --> 07:07.999
I am a huge supporter.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.280
In '08, I was the national
cochair of Kappas for Romney.

07:10.281 --> 07:11.401
You caught me. I'm a Romney.

07:11.402 --> 07:15.003
I'm trying to be
incognito, so just...

07:15.004 --> 07:16.008
You're... Tagg?

07:16.009 --> 07:17.075
- Tugg.
- Tugg?

07:17.078 --> 07:19.016
Tugg Romney, yeah.

07:19.017 --> 07:20.048
I'm Tugg Romney.

07:20.049 --> 07:22.046
Tagg's everywhere.
Too much Tagg for me.

07:22.047 --> 07:23.079
Tugg.

07:26.017 --> 07:28.045
Whoo! What a night.

07:28.046 --> 07:29.096
What a crazy night.

07:29.097 --> 07:32.045
Yeah, me, too.
I found a dollar on my way out

07:32.046 --> 07:34.999
of the restaurant. I used it
to buy a slice of pizza.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.017
One day closer to death!

07:36.018 --> 07:38.061
Winston, what is wrong with you?

07:38.062 --> 07:41.057
No. Nothing wrong with me, girl.
I'm just brushing my hair.

07:41.058 --> 07:43.689
I just want to say
that I had meaningless,

07:43.690 --> 07:45.050
wonderful sex last night with Sam.

07:45.051 --> 07:48.037
And that sex would
not have been possible

07:48.038 --> 07:50.082
without the efforts
of a one Nick Miller.

07:50.083 --> 07:52.028
Ugh! But okay.

07:52.029 --> 07:53.229
I don't want to kiss and tell,

07:53.230 --> 07:55.110
but he did ruin my dresser
during intercourse.

07:55.111 --> 07:57.045
Come on!
Why are you saying that?

07:57.046 --> 08:00.029
- Will you go to Ikea with me?
- Sure, I'm not doing anything.

08:00.030 --> 08:02.150
But don't let me lay my eyes
on the Malm collection.

08:02.151 --> 08:04.351
I can't afford it, and I'm
a sucker for it every time.

08:04.352 --> 08:06.037
I'll go get my golf pencils.

08:06.038 --> 08:07.999
WINSTON:
Mm-hmm.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.033
If you got something to say,
my man, just say it.

08:10.034 --> 08:12.049
Hey, look, a man can only
sit back and observe

08:12.050 --> 08:15.011
but for so long
before he has to speak his mind.

08:15.012 --> 08:16.012
Then speak your mind.

08:16.013 --> 08:18.020
A line has been crossed, all right?

08:18.021 --> 08:20.024
You, my friend,
have become her fluffer.

08:20.025 --> 08:21.082
Like in porn?

08:21.083 --> 08:23.024
An emotional fluffer.

08:23.025 --> 08:24.040
I'm an emotional fluffer?

08:24.041 --> 08:25.761
You got to set
some boundaries, all right?

08:25.762 --> 08:27.032
You're gonna start fulfilling

08:27.033 --> 08:29.053
ever single need of hers, all right?

08:29.054 --> 08:31.054
Doing all the things
that a boyfriend would do...

08:31.055 --> 08:32.238
Winston...

08:32.239 --> 08:34.159
...for some other dude
who ain't doing nothing.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.000
- And I'm her friend.
- You're her boyfriend.

08:36.001 --> 08:37.041
No, I'm not her boyfriend.

08:37.042 --> 08:38.642
You're a boyfriend
without the rewards.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.172
How about this?
Why don't you just shut up?

08:40.173 --> 08:41.453
- Hey, Nick, you ready?
- Yeah.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.174
So it's not available
at the closest Ikea,

08:43.174 --> 08:45.095
but it is available at
the second-closest Ikea,

08:45.096 --> 08:47.066
which is about 45 minutes...

08:47.067 --> 08:49.033
if we could drive over the reservoir.

08:49.034 --> 08:51.061
But we can't, so...

08:51.062 --> 08:53.079
- it's about an hour and a half.
- Cool.

08:53.082 --> 08:57.021
I had so much sex
last night. (Chuckles)

08:58.096 --> 09:00.008
Fluffer.

09:01.017 --> 09:03.054
- You're gonna get caught.
- Impossible.

09:03.055 --> 09:05.038
I've been studying
Romney trivia all day long.

09:05.039 --> 09:08.007
Memorizing Dad's gestures
so I can mimic him.

09:08.008 --> 09:10.448
You're calling Mitt Romney "Dad"
now? That's where we're at?

09:10.449 --> 09:11.729
- Mm-hmm.
- Schmidt, we get it.

09:11.730 --> 09:13.070
He's the dad you never had.

09:13.071 --> 09:16.049
Okay, all-knowing
Indian god Ganesha,

09:16.050 --> 09:18.016
this is about sex.

09:18.017 --> 09:19.377
You know they have Romney Olympics

09:19.378 --> 09:21.011
every summer at the lake house?

09:21.012 --> 09:22.612
I bet that's a hoot.
I'm sure it's like

09:22.613 --> 09:25.038
the real Olympics, only the
white people win the sprints.

09:28.008 --> 09:29.168
- Okay, so you good?
- Okay.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.037
Yeah.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.056
Hey, Nick, any chance

09:32.057 --> 09:34.029
you understand
how to put this together?

09:34.030 --> 09:36.032
I think it looks
pretty easy, actually.

09:36.033 --> 09:39.020
No, you know, I'm
actually busy. I'm, uh...

09:39.021 --> 09:40.054
I'm moving money around.

09:40.055 --> 09:42.016
I'm-I'm diversifying.
I've got...

09:42.017 --> 09:44.010
And I'm not your fluffer, by the way.

09:44.011 --> 09:45.036
What's a fluffer?

09:45.037 --> 09:46.094
In pornography,

09:46.095 --> 09:48.092
it's the person who
keeps the actor...

09:48.093 --> 09:50.091
motivated, aroused, you know?

09:50.092 --> 09:52.037
Ew! That's a job?

09:52.038 --> 09:55.061
And that's what I am.
I'm your emotional fluffer.

09:55.062 --> 09:58.032
I'm there whenever you need a guy.

09:58.033 --> 09:59.473
You want a cup of tea, I'll make it.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.016
You lose your phone, I'll call.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.020
You're my friend.
That's what friends do.

10:03.021 --> 10:05.024
I'm you boyfriend
without the rewards.

10:05.025 --> 10:06.045
Oh?

10:06.046 --> 10:08.038
Yeah.

10:10.038 --> 10:12.074
You're saying you want the...?

10:12.075 --> 10:16.032
No! No, no, no, no, no.
Not with you. Blecch!

10:16.033 --> 10:18.096
- Don't say "blecch!"
- I don't want it.

10:18.099 --> 10:21.024
I'm not disgusting.
It's not an unheard of thought.

10:21.025 --> 10:21.971
Blecch!

10:21.972 --> 10:23.732
Come on. Admit it,
you've thought about it.

10:23.733 --> 10:24.853
You and me, sexually?
Nope.

10:24.854 --> 10:26.334
Blecch!
Never thought about it once.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.029
- Don't lie.
- Not on purpose.

10:28.032 --> 10:31.007
Sleeping Nick is a totally
different guy.

10:31.008 --> 10:33.448
You know you did when you walked
in on me doing deep lunges.

10:33.449 --> 10:35.079
Yeah, check my Google history, Jess.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.028
It's filled with girls
doing deep lunges.

10:38.029 --> 10:39.709
I mean, I'll admit
I've thought about it.

10:40.096 --> 10:43.029
- Yeah.
- When was this?

10:43.032 --> 10:45.037
Last year. Just once.

10:45.038 --> 10:47.074
(English accent):
Would you like to eat me?

10:47.075 --> 10:50.016
What do you mean?
Aren't you a little small?

10:50.017 --> 10:52.074
What, are you nuts?!
(Laughs)

10:52.075 --> 10:54.028
(Sobbing):
What happened?

10:54.029 --> 10:56.078
Why am I doing this?

10:56.079 --> 10:58.028
That's what does it for you?

10:58.029 --> 10:59.762
Yeah, I thought about it
for five minutes,

10:59.763 --> 11:02.083
and then I realized it would
never, ever work between us.

11:02.084 --> 11:05.011
Yeah, I agree.
That's how I see it.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.092
- Great. I'm glad we agree on something.
- Me, too!

11:07.093 --> 11:07.544
Great.

11:07.545 --> 11:09.505
Out of curiosity, why do
you think that, though?

11:09.506 --> 11:11.095
Because you drive me nuts, Miller!

11:11.096 --> 11:13.091
Because you're always sighing,

11:13.092 --> 11:15.091
like you're the president
of the United States

11:15.092 --> 11:17.999
and you have to decide whether
we're going to war or not.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.057
I sigh because you
sing about everything.

11:20.058 --> 11:21.061
I do not.

11:21.062 --> 11:22.094
♪ And I hate it. ♪

11:22.095 --> 11:24.025
♪ You sing and dance
about nothing. ♪

11:24.026 --> 11:25.074
You're cheap!

11:25.075 --> 11:27.033
- You are so cheap.
- I'm not cheap.

11:27.036 --> 11:29.173
You never, ever put money
in any tip jar, ever.

11:29.174 --> 11:31.814
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you ever do that.

11:31.815 --> 11:33.575
Last week, when we
went to the coffee shop.

11:33.576 --> 11:35.375
- You put nickels in the tip jar!
- You know what

11:35.378 --> 11:37.404
- a jar is in my business?
- Nickels! Nickels are worse

11:37.405 --> 11:38.605
than no money; it's an insult.

11:38.606 --> 11:40.116
It's just a little
boy saying, "Love me!"

11:40.117 --> 11:41.917
- "Give me attention!"
- You're a bartender.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.094
You live on tips. You
should know better.

11:43.095 --> 11:43.403
The nickel?

11:43.404 --> 11:45.280
- The only American currency...
- You can't not give someone a tip

11:45.281 --> 11:46.177
Because you don't like tip jars!

11:46.178 --> 11:47.438
...graced with the face
of Thomas Jefferson.

11:47.439 --> 11:49.610
- Well, I think that's rude, Nick!
- I didn't realize you were on the fence

11:49.611 --> 11:51.891
- about the Louisiana Purchase...
- You hate everything!

11:51.892 --> 11:53.892
- ...Jessica!
- And I could never live with that.

11:53.893 --> 11:54.933
I barely live with it now!

11:54.934 --> 11:57.579
But you need me to have sex.

12:00.817 --> 12:02.567
Oh, that's what you think?

12:04.067 --> 12:05.092
I'm calling Sam,

12:05.093 --> 12:07.041
and we're gonna go on a date.

12:07.042 --> 12:09.033
And we're gonna talk our faces off.

12:09.034 --> 12:10.988
- Okay?
- Good luck. Good luck with that.

12:10.989 --> 12:13.029
- Can't find your phone, Jess?
- No, I'll find it.

12:13.032 --> 12:15.472
- 'Cause I'm not calling you this time.
- Are you happy now?

12:15.473 --> 12:17.593
Now I have to get to know
the guy I'm sleeping with.

12:18.042 --> 12:20.042
(Cell phone ringing)

12:21.890 --> 12:23.090
NICK:
That was a pocket dial!

12:23.091 --> 12:25.015
That was an ill-timed
pocket dial!

12:25.016 --> 12:26.056
I will not explain myself!

12:26.057 --> 12:27.029
(Door slams)

12:27.562 --> 12:30.178
I just wish I had a lot
more solo Tugg time.

12:30.829 --> 12:31.832
You know?

12:31.833 --> 12:33.791
Well, you can be Tugg with me.

12:34.042 --> 12:37.032
Sometimes I think that
I'm just a riddle that,

12:37.033 --> 12:39.033
well, even I can't solve.

12:41.062 --> 12:43.079
Yeah, see? I tried
to solve it again.

12:45.533 --> 12:46.592
(Knocking at door)

12:46.593 --> 12:47.592
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:47.595 --> 12:48.721
I hope it's okay,

12:48.722 --> 12:50.562
I invited over some of
the Kappas For Romney.

12:50.563 --> 12:52.554
- Kappas For Romney!
- Courtney.

12:52.557 --> 12:54.317
- Such a pleasure. - Courtney.
- I'm April.

12:54.318 --> 12:56.238
- April.
- They just got so excited when I said

12:56.239 --> 12:57.399
I met one of the Romney boys.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.240
- Oh, no, who wouldn't be?
- Did you ask him?

12:59.241 --> 13:01.004
I think April's in love
with your brothers.

13:01.005 --> 13:02.365
- Who isn't?
- Who's the shy one?

13:02.366 --> 13:03.846
Who's the joker?
Who's tried coffee?

13:03.847 --> 13:05.327
COURTNEY:
April, you're such a spaz.

13:05.328 --> 13:07.288
Yeah, no, nobody gets rowdy
like us Romney boys.

13:07.789 --> 13:09.629
Just a bunch of alphas,
you know what I mean?

13:09.630 --> 13:10.470
- Yeah.
- (Giggling)

13:10.471 --> 13:11.541
That is, of course,

13:11.542 --> 13:14.507
unless we're fishing
on Lake Winnipesauke.

13:14.508 --> 13:16.228
There's nothing that
I love more than just

13:16.229 --> 13:17.591
getting out on the water with Dad,

13:17.592 --> 13:19.553
the freezing cold dawn,

13:19.554 --> 13:21.520
a couple of cold beers in hand.

13:21.521 --> 13:22.761
Having that one quick moment...

13:22.762 --> 13:24.525
Your dad doesn't drink.
He's a Mormon.

13:24.526 --> 13:27.537
Well, we don't drink
the beers, Courtney.

13:27.538 --> 13:30.507
You know, we just buy them
to support American breweries.

13:30.508 --> 13:31.708
Then we dump them in the lake.

13:31.709 --> 13:33.558
'Cause we're Americans.

13:35.512 --> 13:38.578
So... um...

13:38.579 --> 13:40.699
I want a casual sex affair,
just like in the movies.

13:40.700 --> 13:43.504
- Nice.
- But it turns out...

13:43.507 --> 13:45.503
I need some conversation first.

13:45.504 --> 13:46.549
So...

13:46.550 --> 13:47.790
- If you want to hang...
- No.

13:47.791 --> 13:49.525
- ...Hang out more...
- I don't...

13:49.528 --> 13:51.344
- I don't want to hang out more.
- Okay.

13:51.345 --> 13:52.625
Because, if I hang out with you,

13:52.626 --> 13:54.786
it's just the truth, I'm
gonna fall in love with you.

13:54.787 --> 13:56.747
It's just how I am.
I can't separate things out.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.595
Question:
Under what circumstances

13:58.596 --> 14:01.578
would you build a
dresser for a woman?

14:01.579 --> 14:03.516
And this is, like...

14:03.517 --> 14:05.520
and I'm not interested
in sleeping with her?

14:05.521 --> 14:06.529
Um...

14:07.533 --> 14:09.533
- Am I being blackmailed?
- No.

14:09.534 --> 14:10.544
Oh, is it like a...

14:10.545 --> 14:12.425
it's like a Make-A-Wish
Foundation type thing?

14:12.426 --> 14:15.512
- No.
- I mean... Yeah. Marriage.

14:15.513 --> 14:17.273
You know, anything
besides marriage is a...

14:17.274 --> 14:18.507
you know, an abuse.

14:18.508 --> 14:19.545
An abuse?

14:19.546 --> 14:22.511
Yeah, you can't do that to a friend.

14:22.512 --> 14:24.503
Unless your friend's a chump.

14:24.504 --> 14:26.561
Or a certified carpenter...
that would work.

14:26.562 --> 14:29.511
Wait a minute.
This isn't a sex thing, is it?

14:29.512 --> 14:30.558
Because I... you know,

14:30.559 --> 14:32.566
I can't pleasure a woman

14:32.567 --> 14:34.587
and build a dresser
at the same time, you know?

14:34.588 --> 14:35.596
I'm not God.

14:37.583 --> 14:39.583
(Muffled moans)

14:41.592 --> 14:44.546
- Hey.
- (Grunting)

14:44.549 --> 14:45.582
Hey!

14:45.583 --> 14:47.548
Hey! Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on, man?

14:47.549 --> 14:48.829
Are you going to the dark place?

14:48.830 --> 14:50.508
I'm not going to
the dark place, okay?

14:50.509 --> 14:52.349
I did what you said,
I told her I didn't want

14:52.350 --> 14:53.830
to be her fluffer, and it went great.

14:53.831 --> 14:55.384
Then what is wrong
with you? Get up, man.

14:55.385 --> 14:57.305
Look, I did what you said,
and I feel terrible.

14:57.306 --> 14:58.666
Because you didn't set boundaries.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.227
I don't know what
that means, Winston.

15:00.228 --> 15:01.908
As a friend, you can
lift a heavy object,

15:01.909 --> 15:03.749
but you can't drive her
to the airport, okay?

15:03.750 --> 15:05.428
You can hold the elevator, but only

15:05.429 --> 15:07.029
if you see her running
down the hallway

15:07.030 --> 15:09.190
saying, "Hey, man, please
can you hold the elevator?"

15:09.191 --> 15:10.532
No picnics,
no mini-muffins

15:10.533 --> 15:11.550
and never Adele.

15:11.551 --> 15:12.588
- Adele?
- Never Adele.

15:12.591 --> 15:14.550
- Adele's amazing.
- No Adele.

15:14.551 --> 15:16.515
No concerts, no music,
no T-shirts, no nothing.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.076
- But guys and girls...
- Never Adele!

15:18.077 --> 15:20.558
- A little Adele.
- (Chuckles)

15:20.561 --> 15:23.499
Hey. Hey. Hey!
Hey! Hey!

15:23.500 --> 15:25.545
Nick! You're gonna
calm down, okay?

15:25.546 --> 15:26.746
You want my help or what, man?

15:26.747 --> 15:28.511
Yes.

15:28.512 --> 15:29.512
Don't be so intense.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.570
Most importantly...

15:31.571 --> 15:33.570
you will not build her that dresser.

15:33.571 --> 15:35.507
It's furniture.

15:35.508 --> 15:36.538
It implies that one day,

15:36.539 --> 15:38.570
you will share it with her.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.516
And that's not gonna happen.

15:40.517 --> 15:43.512
You're right.
You're right.

15:48.596 --> 15:50.587
Are-are you spelling it right?

15:50.588 --> 15:52.582
Two "G"s, silent "B."

15:52.583 --> 15:53.583
Here's a picture

15:53.584 --> 15:55.499
of the whole family.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.565
And you are not in it.

15:56.566 --> 15:58.686
Yeah, well, somebody had
to take the picture, Megan.

15:58.687 --> 16:00.498
Just admit it.
You're not a Romney.

16:00.499 --> 16:02.579
Oh, I'm not a Romney?
Would a non-Romney know this?

16:02.580 --> 16:04.595
That Ma and Pa never go to bed angry.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.587
That there are 16 grandchildren,

16:06.588 --> 16:09.537
Allie, Joe, Thomas, Gracie,
Wyatt, Parker, Miles, Jonathan,

16:09.538 --> 16:12.516
Sawyer, Nate, Nash, Mia, Owen,
Soleil, Nick and Chloe.

16:12.517 --> 16:13.534
Those are just facts

16:13.535 --> 16:14.575
you got from the Internet.

16:14.576 --> 16:17.561
I'm proud to be a Romney.

16:17.562 --> 16:20.549
Okay? I'm proud to have had
a dad that was around

16:20.550 --> 16:21.558
when I was growing up.

16:21.559 --> 16:23.549
A dad that took me camping,

16:23.550 --> 16:25.549
a dad that spent Saturdays with me,

16:25.550 --> 16:27.582
throwing...
throwing the football.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.545
A dad that gave me a wink

16:29.546 --> 16:31.507
when I left for prom night

16:31.508 --> 16:33.516
and said, "Be safe, son."

16:33.517 --> 16:35.557
When I think of a dad like that,

16:35.558 --> 16:36.581
I'm proud not only

16:36.582 --> 16:38.575
of the Romney name,
but of this country.

16:38.576 --> 16:41.511
God bless Mitt Romney.

16:41.512 --> 16:43.554
God bless America.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.525
It's a candid shot from
the governor's biography.

16:47.526 --> 16:49.525
The caption says,
"The whole family."

16:51.579 --> 16:53.574
Nitpicking turns me off.

16:53.575 --> 16:55.529
You're all horribly
unattractive to me.

16:55.530 --> 16:57.546
Tugg Romney, out.

17:01.325 --> 17:02.261
Hey.

17:02.512 --> 17:03.594
I got your text.

17:03.595 --> 17:05.579
When you're going through
a Taylor Swift-like

17:05.579 --> 17:08.553
range of emotions,
I should come over, right?

17:08.554 --> 17:10.560
You were the only one
that I could talk to.

17:10.561 --> 17:13.587
Being brown, you have
the wisdom of 1,000 white women.

17:14.338 --> 17:15.345
All right.

17:15.346 --> 17:17.346
What happened with that girl?

17:20.291 --> 17:21.320
Winston.

17:22.338 --> 17:23.345
Winston.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.346
- Hey.
- Hmm?

17:25.348 --> 17:27.308
- Are you serious right now?
- Well, I...

17:27.310 --> 17:29.312
- He-he said it was okay.
- She is off limits.

17:29.313 --> 17:30.338
Go call your girlfriend.

17:30.339 --> 17:33.278
You obviously have things
you need to work out.

17:33.279 --> 17:34.320
Fine. Fine.

17:34.321 --> 17:37.337
But for the record,
it was loving and tender

17:37.338 --> 17:39.273
and you squeezed my hand at the end.

17:39.274 --> 17:40.342
Get out of here!

17:40.343 --> 17:41.342
Deviant.

17:41.343 --> 17:44.261
Okay, so...

17:44.262 --> 17:45.333
tell me what happened.

17:45.334 --> 17:47.320
Well, I'm back to being Schmidt.

17:47.321 --> 17:48.749
I'm gonna miss it, though.

17:48.750 --> 17:49.819
Being a Romney.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.758
Schmidt, your life
would not have been better

17:51.759 --> 17:53.757
if you were a Romney.

17:53.758 --> 17:56.774
Cece, look, my dad left

17:56.775 --> 17:57.817
when I was eight.

17:57.818 --> 17:59.761
Okay?

17:59.762 --> 18:01.962
And then he went and had
three kids with his new wife,

18:01.963 --> 18:03.803
and me and my mom
were just these two weirdos

18:03.804 --> 18:04.844
who belonged to nobody.

18:04.845 --> 18:06.833
Until she started
spending all this time

18:06.834 --> 18:08.766
with this woman from work who...

18:08.767 --> 18:10.007
who she still lives with today.

18:11.750 --> 18:12.841
Schmidt.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.795
He's your dad. All right?

18:14.796 --> 18:15.825
Find a way to forgive him

18:15.826 --> 18:18.837
for not being a presidential
candidate with great hair.

18:18.838 --> 18:20.766
Forget it.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.792
No one understands.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.412
There, I thought you
needed that, okay?

18:25.413 --> 18:26.796
(Sighs)

18:26.799 --> 18:28.825
- Just take a breath, and it will...
- Shh.

18:28.828 --> 18:31.761
Shh, shh, shh.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.762
It's like memory foam.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.771
Call your dad.

18:41.771 --> 18:43.820
You've been cheating
on me in your mind?

18:43.821 --> 18:45.841
Yes, but, like, to be
fair, you were there.

18:45.842 --> 18:48.778
A lot of times, you would just
pop up mad, but you were there.

18:48.779 --> 18:51.512
Winston, come on, it's fine.
Look, you can think about

18:51.513 --> 18:52.833
whatever you want to think about.

18:52.834 --> 18:55.757
I know I'm the one
you want to be with.

18:55.758 --> 18:57.800
Come on, want to come
upstairs and watch some SVU?

18:57.801 --> 19:00.778
You want to watch SVU right now?

19:00.779 --> 19:02.419
Well, I'm too wound up
to watch Raymond.

19:02.420 --> 19:03.792
Look, sometimes after a big fight,

19:03.793 --> 19:05.766
I like to cool off with some TV.

19:05.767 --> 19:06.887
What do you mean, big fight?

19:06.888 --> 19:08.817
- We just had a fight.
- We hardly talked.

19:08.818 --> 19:11.338
Like, I want to talk, I want to
fight, I want to do something!

19:11.339 --> 19:13.842
Well, maybe we can fight
in your mind.

19:20.025 --> 19:21.091
Hey.

19:21.092 --> 19:23.016
Stop.

19:23.017 --> 19:25.025
- Jess...
- Stop. Do not... Come on, Nick.

19:25.026 --> 19:26.346
Don't build that dresser, please.

19:26.347 --> 19:28.036
Jess, it's fine.
I have another one.

19:28.037 --> 19:29.677
I need, like, three
to build this thing.

19:29.678 --> 19:31.011
I can't let you fluff me.

19:31.012 --> 19:33.045
I can't let you work
in emotional porn.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.126
You have too much to offer.

19:34.127 --> 19:35.088
Forget it, Jess.

19:35.089 --> 19:36.999
I'm building you the dresser.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.065
I love this stuff.

19:38.066 --> 19:39.186
It's like high-stakes Legos.

19:39.187 --> 19:42.011
Okay, but...

19:42.012 --> 19:44.057
I didn't know what
I was doing to you.

19:44.058 --> 19:47.049
I've always had relationships
in different boxes.

19:47.050 --> 19:48.088
Friends in one box,

19:48.089 --> 19:50.087
boyfriends in another.

19:50.088 --> 19:52.074
But now...

19:52.075 --> 19:55.037
it's messy, and...

19:55.038 --> 19:57.049
I don't want to screw up
what I have with you.

19:57.050 --> 19:59.290
- You're too important to me.
- It's different with us.

19:59.291 --> 20:03.045
We're just two people
who want to be friends,

20:03.046 --> 20:05.021
but are sometimes
attracted to each other.

20:05.022 --> 20:06.079
- Ha!
- No, no...

20:06.080 --> 20:08.008
You have thought about the reward.

20:08.009 --> 20:10.053
That's not what I said.

20:10.054 --> 20:11.214
My calculations were correct.

20:11.215 --> 20:13.016
I love deep lunges.

20:13.017 --> 20:15.029
- (Laughs)
- Just don't make a big deal of it.

20:15.030 --> 20:16.092
I just don't need

20:16.093 --> 20:18.057
a bunch of people

20:18.058 --> 20:20.057
telling me what we can
and can't do together.

20:20.058 --> 20:22.074
That pisses me off.

20:22.075 --> 20:23.687
If I want to build you a dresser,

20:23.688 --> 20:25.088
I'm gonna build you a damn dresser.

20:27.050 --> 20:29.053
But if you want to
have dates before sex,

20:29.054 --> 20:31.051
just do me a favor

20:31.052 --> 20:33.092
and have them with the guy
you're having sex with.

20:33.093 --> 20:36.062
- Agreed.
- Good.

20:36.065 --> 20:38.066
Maybe I should just
stop trying with Sam.

20:38.067 --> 20:40.045
I'm old-fashioned
below the belt.

20:40.046 --> 20:42.045
I've got a Civil War-era
piece of equipment,

20:42.046 --> 20:43.067
and that's all she wrote.

20:45.071 --> 20:47.007
All right.

20:47.008 --> 20:49.008
I got to give you something now.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.092
Something... really
close to my heart.

20:54.096 --> 20:57.007
That's Nick's Sexy Mix.

20:57.008 --> 20:59.041
AKA the original fluffer.

20:59.042 --> 21:01.066
"The Humpty Dance"
does it for you, Nick?

21:01.567 --> 21:03.095
Do your thing, girl.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.037
Get crazy.

21:05.038 --> 21:08.004
♪ ♪

21:09.088 --> 21:11.045
When we're done,

21:11.046 --> 21:13.087
I want you to immediately
turn this off.

21:13.588 --> 21:15.088
Yes.

21:16.088 --> 21:18.088
(Muffled song continues)

21:21.075 --> 21:24.075
- (Upbeat song begins)
- Ooh... (Chuckles)
