FOR TRYIN'.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.100
OH, THANK YOU, SUGAR.

03:01.100 --> 03:04.867
AND THAT I THINK
THE BIGGEST CRISIS
FACING THIS COUNTRY

03:04.867 --> 03:06.700
IS THE BREAKDOWN
OF THE AMERICAN
FAMILY.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.367
OH, YOU ALWAYS
GOTTA GO AFTER SHAWN.

03:09.367 --> 03:11.867
I JUST
THINK THAT LOTS
OF OTHER ISSUES,

03:11.867 --> 03:14.200
LIKE CRIME
AND THE DECLINE
IN EDUCATION--

03:14.200 --> 03:15.934
HEY, LAY OFF ME.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.133

03:36.033 --> 03:38.000
WHAT, THAT I'M
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE

03:38.000 --> 03:40.300
FOR THE BREAKDOWN
OF AMERICAN SOCIETY?

03:40.300 --> 03:41.500
NAH, I GOT
BIGGER PROBLEMS.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.667

08:15.867 --> 08:17.033

MOVED IT TO 9:30.
THOSE IDIOTS.

08:24.900 --> 08:28.000
WAIT A MINUTE.
THEY MOVED THAT SHOW
TO 9:30. WHY?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.200
NO ONE KNOWS.
WAS IT DOING BADLY
AT 8:30?

08:30.200 --> 08:32.000
NO.
WHY DIDN'T THEY
LEAVE IT ALONE?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.133
THEY'RE
TRYING TO KILL IT.

08:33.133 --> 08:35.100

08:37.233 --> 08:38.467
WE HAVE TO HAVE
A LITTLE TALK.

08:38.467 --> 08:39.467
RIGHT AFTER THE SHOW.

08:39.467 --> 08:42.900
THERE WILL BE NO SHOW.
GET TO BED.

08:42.900 --> 08:47.000
THAT WAS NICELY DONE.
NOW IT'S JUST YOU

08:50.300 --> 08:51.934
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,
DO YOU?

08:51.934 --> 08:54.400
YES, I DO,

A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE,

08:54.400 --> 08:57.900
NOT JUST TO ME AND YOU,
BUT TO ALL MEN AND WOMEN
IN RELATIONSHIPS,

08:57.900 --> 08:59.000
