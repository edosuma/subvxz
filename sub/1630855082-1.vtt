WEBVTT

01:00.277 --> 01:03.019
Oh, I've heard it all before.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.979
Work twice as hard for half as
much.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.157
But that never stopped me from
getting to this side of the
table.

01:10.287 --> 01:10.896
But you...

01:11.027 --> 01:12.681
And before you say it,

01:13.116 --> 01:15.771
I don't owe you a thing.

01:16.859 --> 01:19.514
Want me to do for you
what no one did for me?

01:22.995 --> 01:23.735
What about...

01:24.606 --> 01:25.650
appreciation?

01:25.781 --> 01:26.564
Oh.

01:27.652 --> 01:30.786
You want me to stand on my
doorstep
and clap for you?

01:31.265 --> 01:32.744
Is that what you want?

01:33.267 --> 01:34.703
I'll do one better.

01:38.533 --> 01:41.492
Thank you, Jennifer, for all
your work.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.408
Your services are no longer
required.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.454
You can't do that.

01:47.019 --> 01:49.544
I just re-coded
your entire computer system,
okay?

01:50.675 --> 01:52.112
I've given you everything.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.592
And what?

01:56.333 --> 01:57.465
And what if I don't leave?

01:58.944 --> 02:01.033
What if I take a stand?

02:02.687 --> 02:04.820
Are you going to take a stand?

02:09.825 --> 02:10.391
No.

02:12.697 --> 02:13.437
No I'm not.

03:00.441 --> 03:02.225
Are you going to take a stand?

03:30.558 --> 03:31.950
Keep working hard,
like you always do,

03:32.081 --> 03:32.995
and something will appear.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.477
So how's the wedding prep going?

03:36.999 --> 03:38.348
She still wants me to do a
speech, Mum.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.701
She's got a job on there.

03:46.487 --> 03:47.836
So, any umm?

03:50.186 --> 03:50.926
Nope.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.363
Don't be such a cynic.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.200
So how much to save this place,
then?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.029
50 within the month.

04:07.682 --> 04:08.900
It's ridiculous what they're
doing Mum.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.467
Happened in Brixton,

04:10.902 --> 04:12.339
happening everywhere else.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.037
I turnover enough money.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.475
It's just this one bloody
payment
they're slapping everyone with.

04:23.306 --> 04:23.698
Who is it?

04:24.960 --> 04:25.439
Hmm?

04:26.788 --> 04:27.789
Hello?

04:29.181 --> 04:32.446
How do you expect high rewards
if you don't take high risks?

04:33.142 --> 04:34.056
Sorry?

04:34.752 --> 04:37.059
Be at the Ruby Blue Bar on
Oswald Street

04:37.189 --> 04:39.061
at 12 noon.

04:41.150 --> 04:41.803
Who are you?

04:41.933 --> 04:43.544
I have a job for you.

04:43.674 --> 04:47.374
When you arrive,
just say 'Anne Boleyn's ruby
slipper

04:47.504 --> 04:50.855
always shone in the pale
moonlight'...

04:59.516 --> 05:01.344
I just don't know who'd do this?

05:02.606 --> 05:03.607
Have you let anyone go recently?

05:05.479 --> 05:07.437
Only 27 people in the last
month.

05:09.526 --> 05:10.832
27?

05:11.833 --> 05:14.401
Fix it now.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.140
Anne Boleyn's ruby slipper

05:58.270 --> 06:01.361
always shone in the pale
moonlight.

06:03.101 --> 06:03.711
What?

06:05.756 --> 06:07.410
Oh, sorry.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.803
Did I not say that right?

06:10.631 --> 06:11.762
Say it again.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.591
Anne Boleyn's ruby slipper

06:14.722 --> 06:17.594
DID always shine in the
moonlight.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.509
All the whilst

06:19.640 --> 06:21.511
Henry's codpiece

06:21.642 --> 06:24.993
protruded several inches from
his crotch.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.299
Although,

06:27.430 --> 06:30.694
by all accounts,
there was a lot more room

06:30.825 --> 06:33.393
in that codpiece,
than Henry wanted people to
know.

06:35.090 --> 06:35.873
Ok Buster,

06:36.396 --> 06:37.397
vamoose.

06:37.658 --> 06:38.485
Okay boss.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.928
Once I despised the pomegranate.

06:47.668 --> 06:51.411
It looked weird, hard to
penetrate.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.065
Pretty messy.

06:54.718 --> 06:55.371
But then

06:56.633 --> 06:57.242
once

06:59.114 --> 07:00.332
I tried it,

07:03.597 --> 07:04.641
and I never looked back.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.644
Oh.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.348
So...

07:17.480 --> 07:18.568
a job.

07:22.616 --> 07:23.660
Do you fancy

07:23.791 --> 07:26.794
nipping into an office
building...

07:26.881 --> 07:28.056
in the city?

07:30.319 --> 07:34.541
Logging onto a computer
and pulling some information
from it.

07:34.671 --> 07:38.414
And what is the info exactly?

07:38.545 --> 07:40.503
I'll come back to that later.

07:42.244 --> 07:45.073
But here's what you need to do.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.337
Enter the building.

07:48.424 --> 07:51.558
Assuming the identity
of one of their employees.

07:54.996 --> 07:57.041
My insider said

07:57.128 --> 08:00.523
that the man on duty on our day
is very lax...

08:02.177 --> 08:04.222
and loves to flirt.

08:04.353 --> 08:09.097
So just bung some glossy,
mesmerizing,
smooth talk at him.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.665
Okay?

08:11.795 --> 08:14.102
They require an official I.D.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.496
that has a biometric chip inside
it,

08:16.626 --> 08:18.541
which we won't have.

08:18.628 --> 08:21.675
So you're going to have to
distract, charm
and convince him

08:21.805 --> 08:24.460
that he doesn't need to scan it.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.507
I'll marry your brother
just to get in your family.

08:28.595 --> 08:32.381
Once inside, you'll have a map
to direct you to the remote
terminal.

08:33.077 --> 08:35.515
You will override the six digit

08:35.645 --> 08:37.908
security code to get into the
room.

08:39.344 --> 08:42.434
With your skills that'll be easy
breezy.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.483
But these aren't
the skills of a computer
programmer.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.398
I was joking.

08:50.312 --> 08:54.795
I have the door code from an
ex-employee.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.103
Sorry.

09:02.280 --> 09:02.846
Hello?

09:04.065 --> 09:05.501
Alan darling...

09:07.634 --> 09:11.202
a useless Scouser finishes his
time.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.161
Is that news?

09:14.336 --> 09:15.032
Yeah.

09:15.511 --> 09:16.904
While, I remember.

09:17.034 --> 09:20.690
Would you source a prop for me
for Wednesday?

09:21.778 --> 09:22.431
Thank you.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.132
Erm, before you go on,
I just want to say that you know
that...

09:28.263 --> 09:32.397
You locate a folder called
Oliver.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.836
Then extract the encrypted data
from it.

09:36.271 --> 09:38.447
Throw it onto a flashy drive.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.581
You mean a flash drive?

09:44.192 --> 09:44.845
No.

09:47.674 --> 09:51.025
After that,
you'll be met by my delightful
driver.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.462
Once I've received the flashy
from you,

09:53.854 --> 09:56.160
checked the data is all tickety
boo.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.815
I will give you your fee.

10:00.121 --> 10:04.473
So what is the fee?

10:04.604 --> 10:07.084
What's 1% of 500 million?

10:17.486 --> 10:20.097
Must be pretty valuable data
then?

10:21.272 --> 10:25.320
It's a collection of accounts,
passwords and pins accessing the
compound

10:25.450 --> 10:31.108
interest on the hushed up money
that MPs skimmed off their
expenses

10:31.195 --> 10:34.590
BEFORE the scandal of '09.

10:35.939 --> 10:38.333
And just to put it all out
there,

10:39.856 --> 10:42.206
this is illegal, isn't it?

10:43.599 --> 10:46.428
Do you want to carry
on playing by the rules?

10:47.690 --> 10:50.475
Or do you want to play the game?

10:55.263 --> 10:56.133
I can't.

10:56.873 --> 10:57.831
Oh, yes, you can.

10:57.918 --> 11:00.485
You really can.

11:00.616 --> 11:03.663
I know you can,
because I know you need it.

11:05.577 --> 11:08.885
Also a little bird happened to
tell me

11:09.016 --> 11:12.933
that you planted a parting gift
on the FWP database.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.371
Yeah that proves to me

11:16.501 --> 11:19.417
that you have a degree of
derring do,

11:20.636 --> 11:22.246
but also...

11:23.117 --> 11:26.381
it gives me something to hold
over you.

11:28.818 --> 11:29.732
Pomegranate?

11:31.603 --> 11:32.256
No thank you.

11:34.041 --> 11:37.000
You have 48 hours.

11:44.312 --> 11:46.706
Yes. Oh.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.534
Ah great!

11:50.971 --> 11:52.537
Yeah thanks.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.503
We'll keep your details on file.
We'll get back to you.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.287
Whatever.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.176
Come on.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.613
It's not the public,
it's family and friends.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.963
And I want to upstage
Harley's best woman speech!

12:27.703 --> 12:28.486
Lols.

12:30.793 --> 12:31.881
Family and friends.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.928
A thousand people. One single
stranger.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.886
All terrifying Ade, no.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.324
Any job luck?

12:41.151 --> 12:42.065
I've had an offer.

12:42.370 --> 12:43.763
Boom!

12:43.850 --> 12:45.634
Black girl magic baby!

12:45.765 --> 12:48.202
Yeah, but I dunno if I'm gonna
take it.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.334
You're behind on your rent,
aren't you?

12:51.248 --> 12:52.162
Three months.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.558
So what's it saying moneywise?

12:56.688 --> 12:57.341
The job?

12:58.386 --> 12:59.213
It's saying...

13:00.780 --> 13:01.955
it's saying a lot.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.478
So what's the problem?

13:06.655 --> 13:08.570
While I remember...

13:08.700 --> 13:09.919
Eric is...

13:10.050 --> 13:10.964
coming to the wedding

13:11.486 --> 13:12.661
and he's bringing his new bae.

13:13.488 --> 13:14.054
Great.

13:15.446 --> 13:16.839
Bring someone.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.190
I remember
when all I wanted to do was just

13:21.148 --> 13:22.932
fall in love and have kids with
a tall,
dark, handsome bachelor

13:23.672 --> 13:26.283
who had a cheeky sense of humour
and a megawatt smile.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.198
Oh, and someone who could slay
hip hop karaoke!

13:29.243 --> 13:30.244
Anything else?

13:30.331 --> 13:31.811
A Magic Mike bod?

13:32.463 --> 13:34.030
Well, if he HAPPENED
to have been in Channing shape,

13:34.117 --> 13:35.640
I wouldn't have complained.

13:36.032 --> 13:37.338
You're speaking in past tense?

13:37.468 --> 13:38.469
Yeah, there's a reason.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.604
I think Jennifer
needs to step out of her comfort
zone.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.693
And I think
Adrienne needs to mind her own
bees wax.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.435
How many have you got left?

13:48.349 --> 13:48.915
Two!

13:49.045 --> 13:49.698
Oh good!

13:49.829 --> 13:51.265
Keep your head still.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.029
Ready?

14:16.420 --> 14:18.248
Are you sabotaging my job
applications?

14:18.553 --> 14:20.163
I want you.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.383
I know you can do it.

14:22.949 --> 14:26.517
And I know you and your family
need
the moolah.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.693
I've never done anything like
this before.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.566
Am I incarcerated right now?

14:32.306 --> 14:34.656
Am I a novice
without decades of experience?

14:35.048 --> 14:37.006
I know what I'm doing.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.312
Take the leap.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.488
For once in your life.

14:41.489 --> 14:46.059
Yes, we may be dipping outside
the rules a tad
but this is money

14:46.146 --> 14:50.193
no one will miss apart from the
men
who know they are in the wrong.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.240
I really don't want to have to
inform FWP

14:53.370 --> 14:56.504
of your meddling machination
costing them thousands of
pounds.

14:57.374 --> 14:58.680
This is blackmail.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.464
No this is persuasion.

15:03.990 --> 15:04.512
5 million?

15:05.687 --> 15:08.298
For an hour's work.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.739
I'll be back here at 1500.

16:05.573 --> 16:06.487
What the hell is that?

16:08.880 --> 16:09.707
Protection.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.100
I don't need that.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.497
All Gates' employees are
expected
to protect themselves.

16:16.584 --> 16:17.759
Boss's orders.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.587
I am a computer programmer okay?

16:19.674 --> 16:20.762
I don't need that.

16:20.892 --> 16:21.719
Take the bag.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.025
I'm fine, honestly.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.637
Take the bag.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.335
I'm really not comfortable with
this.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.618
Might wanna check the safety's
off.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.925
Pretty sure it is.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.423
I.D.

18:00.427 --> 18:01.993
Lovely weather we're having
today eh?

18:04.300 --> 18:05.040
Is it?

18:07.434 --> 18:08.826
Tara Munis.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.263
Vice president.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.222
Never seen you before.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.442
Oh, we've probably just missed
each other.

18:17.444 --> 18:18.662
I have to scan it.

18:18.967 --> 18:19.576
Wait.

18:22.057 --> 18:26.670
Has anyone told you
that you have really lovely
eyes?

18:29.151 --> 18:29.717
No.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.027
Oh could you do that again for
me please?

18:36.158 --> 18:36.811
No.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.034
There's usually a male
receptionist
that works here,

18:43.122 --> 18:44.035
is he here today?

18:44.732 --> 18:45.211
No.

19:06.449 --> 19:07.755
The receptionist won't let me
in.

19:08.843 --> 19:11.106
Knew I should have put you in
skimpier
attire.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.542
Erm also...

19:12.673 --> 19:15.241
you didn't mention anything
about... a gun.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.070
I protect all my employees,
not least when they're stealing
account

19:19.201 --> 19:21.899
information of the shady senior
bank execs

19:21.986 --> 19:25.294
who took illegal tax free cash

19:25.381 --> 19:28.689
bonuses before the Bank of
England
banned them in 2019.

19:28.776 --> 19:29.429
Wait.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.083
I thought you said it was MP's
expenses?

19:32.214 --> 19:35.304
Let's not get hung up on the
minutia.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.568
Time to use your noggin
to get into the place.

19:41.919 --> 19:42.877
Trigger the fire alarm?

19:43.007 --> 19:45.358
Don't be ridiculous darling.

19:45.662 --> 19:47.316
Find the back entrance.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.449
Slip in.

20:04.203 --> 20:04.942
Alright love?

20:05.682 --> 20:07.249
I couldn't trouble you
for one of those could I?

20:08.076 --> 20:08.859
Alright.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.732
Ah thanks love I'm gasping!

20:28.966 --> 20:30.011
Where do you think you're going?

20:30.577 --> 20:31.186
Work.

20:33.057 --> 20:33.797
What like that?

20:37.627 --> 20:38.585
Oh, I've got a date later.

20:39.934 --> 20:40.978
Lucky man.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.025
Well look Valentina's still on
shift.

20:44.765 --> 20:45.722
Oh, yeah.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.028
The agency called.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.422
They want to give her a day off,
so I'm covering.

20:51.467 --> 20:52.033
A day off?

20:54.035 --> 20:54.862
I could do with one of those.

20:55.558 --> 20:56.342
Have fun.

21:34.684 --> 21:35.946
Oh, come on.

21:37.121 --> 21:39.036
You were on 67% this morning!

22:03.757 --> 22:04.453
Wait.

22:04.584 --> 22:04.975
What did he say it was?

22:05.106 --> 22:05.454
He said it was...

22:06.499 --> 22:07.630
the month reversed...

22:09.066 --> 22:13.070
and the door number... ugh!

22:19.555 --> 22:20.339
Erm...

22:21.035 --> 22:22.123
excuse me?

22:22.732 --> 22:23.777
You're not supposed to be on
this floor.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.563
Hello?

22:27.694 --> 22:30.436
Umm I was told to start at the
top
and then work my way down?

22:31.088 --> 22:32.525
It's my first day
so I'm a bit lost. Sorry.

22:32.655 --> 22:34.962
That's okay.

22:35.092 --> 22:36.006
We'll get you down to Rebecca
and
we'll find out where you're
supposed to be...

22:37.399 --> 22:37.834
Erm do you think we could try
and...

22:37.965 --> 22:38.618
CRAP!

22:39.270 --> 22:39.923
Donny coin's going through the
roof.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.360
You get yourself to reception.

22:41.490 --> 22:42.535
Find out where you're supposed
to be.

22:42.665 --> 22:43.971
Okay, will do.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.813
This is the part of the job I
hate.

24:29.424 --> 24:30.469
Actually, that's a lie.

24:31.513 --> 24:32.253
This is the best bit.

24:33.384 --> 24:34.168
What's your job?

24:48.443 --> 24:50.140
Oh don't worry. It's fake.

24:50.271 --> 24:51.838
I used it for a stag do a few
months back.

24:53.927 --> 24:54.667
Was a good do.

24:56.277 --> 24:58.671
I'm John Smith, COO,

24:59.846 --> 25:02.196
and this is my place.

25:12.206 --> 25:13.033
Forgive me,

25:14.338 --> 25:15.862
but it doesn't look like you're
doing
much cleaning right now?

25:16.732 --> 25:18.604
Maintenance on the internal
network.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.958
Oh, I had to re-train.

25:25.045 --> 25:27.438
I have two jobs,
you know, make ends meet.

25:31.268 --> 25:35.925
Erm could you give me
a little bit of privacy please
so I can...

25:38.101 --> 25:42.366
Oh, I need to go and speak to a
client
anyway.

25:42.671 --> 25:43.367
Cool beans.

25:44.673 --> 25:45.544
How long will you be?

25:47.894 --> 25:48.721
10 minutes?

25:50.374 --> 25:51.637
Cool beans.

26:07.827 --> 26:08.958
I've heard it's rough in your
kinds

26:09.089 --> 26:09.959
of neighborhoods...

26:13.310 --> 26:14.311
But wow.

26:18.489 --> 26:19.055
Oh, don't worry.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.230
I'm not a grass.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.017
Well if you don't mind...

26:24.365 --> 26:25.540
Oh, yes, of course.

26:25.671 --> 26:28.543
I'll go and make a coffee
and do a video call.

26:30.327 --> 26:32.112
Would you like me
to bring a coffee in for you?

26:32.242 --> 26:33.635
I really should just finish my
work,
otherwise I'll be in trouble.

26:34.810 --> 26:35.245
Cool.

26:36.333 --> 26:36.769
Well I'm gonna.

26:36.899 --> 26:37.291
I'm gonna.

26:37.900 --> 26:38.292
Gre...

26:38.379 --> 26:38.858
Great.

27:11.412 --> 27:12.718
Yes dear?

27:13.544 --> 27:14.197
Car trouble.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.200
Yeah it's just not playing ball.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.463
Well you better fix it then?

27:19.594 --> 27:20.508
Haven't you?

27:20.943 --> 27:22.249
And quickly.

27:43.270 --> 27:44.575
Made you a coffee.

27:44.706 --> 27:45.489
One minute.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.374
You looked like
you could use a caffeine boost.

28:00.504 --> 28:01.810
I don't drink coffee.

28:02.158 --> 28:05.031
Oh, you work a cleaning job

28:05.161 --> 28:08.164
and an I.T. job,
but you don't drink coffee?

28:08.469 --> 28:09.470
I like tea.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.602
A nice herbal tea

28:12.603 --> 28:15.084
in a flask and a walk up to
Muswell Hill.

28:15.519 --> 28:17.478
Muswell Hill

28:18.740 --> 28:20.524
I always thought that'd be a
great name
for an R&B group.

28:23.049 --> 28:27.706
You know like Dru Hill, 112,
Black Street,
Jagged Edge.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.838
They all sound like locations.

28:32.145 --> 28:33.624
90s R&B.

28:34.669 --> 28:37.933
If only that level of romance
was possible
in real life.

28:42.938 --> 28:46.550
You know, I found my girlfriend

28:47.987 --> 28:50.293
cheating with my best mate from
uni

28:51.164 --> 28:52.861
on the day I was going to
propose.

28:56.038 --> 28:58.693
Well, if it's any consolation,

28:59.607 --> 29:02.741
there's only three ways
a marriage can go really.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.700
Disappointment,

29:05.831 --> 29:06.570
divorce

29:07.354 --> 29:08.355
or death.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.099
What do you call that? 'The
Three D's'?

29:13.229 --> 29:14.578
'The Three D's'.

29:24.545 --> 29:25.851
I think we're on the same page.

29:29.550 --> 29:30.812
Peaches and cream.

29:35.730 --> 29:36.426
Job done?

29:36.557 --> 29:37.863
Almost.

29:39.168 --> 29:39.952
Now...

29:40.691 --> 29:42.955
you don't do caffeine, but...

29:48.482 --> 29:49.570
do you do tobacco?

29:49.700 --> 29:50.614
I'm fine, thanks.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.403
How long? Ten?

29:57.839 --> 29:59.754
I'll definitely be gone by then.

30:03.018 --> 30:03.627
Well,

30:09.155 --> 30:10.460
I'll be up on the roof

30:11.070 --> 30:12.985
having a smoke
in case you change your mind.

30:14.769 --> 30:16.249
It's a lovely rooftop.

30:24.561 --> 30:25.345
Right.

30:25.475 --> 30:26.041
Let's get out of here.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.611
Right I'm going for a break.

30:31.220 --> 30:32.178
Oh, baby.

30:33.048 --> 30:33.832
What?

31:57.393 --> 31:58.481
Can't believe I almost forgot
this!

32:07.186 --> 32:10.363
I'll be up on the roof having a
smoke
in case you change your mind.

32:54.102 --> 32:55.451
Peaches

32:56.800 --> 32:57.540
and cream.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.980
Hmm. Dance with me.

33:03.677 --> 33:04.286
Sorry what?

33:09.552 --> 33:11.424
The song by 112.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.036
I always preferred
'Dance With Me' to 'Peaches &
Cream'.

33:29.442 --> 33:30.095
Here.

33:33.750 --> 33:34.664
I'm trying to give up.

33:38.538 --> 33:39.582
How were are you going to
propose
by the way?

33:44.631 --> 33:47.460
Booked out the restaurant
we went to on our first date.

33:48.417 --> 33:51.072
Spelled out her name in roses on
the table

33:52.465 --> 33:54.249
and sang 'Let's Get Married' a
cappella
with my schoolmates

33:54.380 --> 33:55.424
on backing vocals.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.300
Corny I know.

34:05.260 --> 34:06.000
Brandy...

34:06.131 --> 34:06.957
'Brandy'?

34:07.393 --> 34:08.350
That was her name?

34:11.223 --> 34:12.746
Not THE Brandy, of course.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.357
Although that'd be rather great.

34:37.379 --> 34:38.076
He swapped 'em.

34:39.207 --> 34:39.816
What?

34:40.513 --> 34:41.731
When he gave us the coffees he's
um...

34:44.212 --> 34:45.605
yeah, yeah he's given me the
latte.

34:46.214 --> 34:46.693
Has he?

34:47.259 --> 34:47.694
Yeah.

34:53.917 --> 34:54.701
It's an Americano.

34:54.831 --> 34:55.658
Its my Americano.

34:55.789 --> 34:56.181
Yeah.

34:56.311 --> 34:56.877
Ugh.

34:57.007 --> 34:57.399
Well here you are.

34:59.271 --> 34:59.923
Cheers mate.

35:10.630 --> 35:11.326
Hello.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.807
Look, my pickup is coming any
minute now.

35:13.894 --> 35:14.851
Where's my USB?

35:17.593 --> 35:18.333
You've got it.

35:18.725 --> 35:19.682
This one is blue.

35:19.813 --> 35:20.727
Mine is red.

35:20.814 --> 35:21.684
Where is it?

35:34.871 --> 35:35.698
Search me...

35:39.441 --> 35:40.138
if you want?

35:43.576 --> 35:45.317
Start at the top and
work your way down.

35:45.447 --> 35:47.057
I can search you
without your instructions.

36:00.201 --> 36:03.378
Funny thing about being a big
COO of a...

36:12.300 --> 36:13.910
You NEVER touch a black woman's
hair.

36:16.304 --> 36:18.132
That's not your real hair?

36:18.263 --> 36:18.872
Yes it is.

36:19.002 --> 36:20.265
I bloody PAID for it!

36:26.096 --> 36:29.622
If we don't increase the sales
target
by next quarter,

36:30.100 --> 36:32.233
we're all going to be really,
really...

36:36.629 --> 36:38.152
She's my chiropractor.

36:39.153 --> 36:40.110
Really?

36:41.721 --> 36:43.331
I just assumed
it was some kind of role play?

36:46.334 --> 36:48.423
Guilty as charged. Haha.

36:48.815 --> 36:52.340
Maybe find somewhere more
discreet?

36:52.471 --> 36:54.603
Yeah, the storage cupboard on
the fifth floor is kind of
handy.

36:55.256 --> 36:55.822
Great.

36:57.693 --> 36:58.477
Have fun.

37:03.090 --> 37:05.048
So I don't think this board of
directors
know what they're doing anyway.

37:05.135 --> 37:06.354
So I think we could do is...

37:06.485 --> 37:07.573
Well they should have made you
partner.

37:07.703 --> 37:08.269
Well of course they should
have...

37:30.422 --> 37:31.423
I can't let you leave with that.

37:53.967 --> 37:54.750
Seriously?

37:55.055 --> 37:56.186
Give me the USB.

38:00.930 --> 38:02.323
I think we both know
you're not going to shoot...

38:09.939 --> 38:14.422
4-7-5 to base, investigating
possible
gunshot at RAD building, West
Side.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.077
Report back when we know more,
over.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.472
Wow, guns are loud!

38:23.126 --> 38:25.085
Jesus Christ you bloody shot me!

38:25.172 --> 38:25.651
Oh my god.

38:25.781 --> 38:26.565
I'm so sorry.

38:26.695 --> 38:28.349
Oh well that's alright then!

38:29.263 --> 38:30.482
Okay we're gonna have to get out
of here
right now.

38:32.048 --> 38:33.354
What happened to your voice?

38:33.963 --> 38:34.703
What are you talking about?

38:34.790 --> 38:36.052
This is my voice. And this...

38:36.618 --> 38:37.967
Alright, this is my real voice.
Okay?

38:38.490 --> 38:39.839
Who are you working for?

38:39.969 --> 38:41.319
Myself. I'm working for myself.

38:44.017 --> 38:45.018
Police!

38:45.148 --> 38:46.498
Is everything alright up there?

38:46.628 --> 38:47.629
We've got to get out of here
right now.

38:47.716 --> 38:48.804
Not before you give me the USB.

38:50.415 --> 38:51.198
Oh...

39:25.798 --> 39:26.451
We're trapped.

39:27.234 --> 39:27.669
Yep.

39:28.757 --> 39:30.019
But God loves a try-er.

39:31.978 --> 39:33.458
Maybe a beam fell?

39:35.198 --> 39:35.677
How old's the building?

39:38.071 --> 39:38.463
Did you hear that Guv?

39:39.159 --> 39:39.551
Hear what?

39:41.727 --> 39:42.249
Seriously?

39:45.687 --> 39:46.340
Let me have a wander.

40:32.212 --> 40:34.344
Parker I'm gonna go and do a
sweep of the ground floor.

40:34.475 --> 40:35.868
As soon as Chopra gets here,

40:35.998 --> 40:37.826
I want you to work your way up
the building.

40:37.957 --> 40:39.132
Right so where am I going?

40:40.046 --> 40:41.003
You're working your way up the
building.

40:41.090 --> 40:42.222
Up the building?

40:42.701 --> 40:43.702
D'ya mean at the top?

40:46.008 --> 40:46.922
I mean up.

40:47.009 --> 40:48.010
Right, up.

40:48.141 --> 40:49.447
Got ya, no worries Guv.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.145
Seen anything?

40:52.450 --> 40:53.538
Heard some noise.

40:53.668 --> 40:55.017
Might have been some office
noise?

40:55.540 --> 40:56.845
Definitely sounded like a
gunshot.

40:57.367 --> 40:58.586
Well this is awkward.

40:59.152 --> 40:59.631
Hmm.

41:01.415 --> 41:03.678
You're the worst thief I've ever
come
across.

41:04.244 --> 41:06.986
I'm not a thief,
I'm a computer programmer.

41:07.377 --> 41:07.856
Yeah.

41:09.510 --> 41:11.251
Anyway, I saw an office party
downstairs.

41:11.381 --> 41:12.078
Did ya?

41:12.208 --> 41:12.774
You know what that means?

41:12.861 --> 41:13.775
What does that mean?

41:13.906 --> 41:14.428
Free cake.

41:14.559 --> 41:14.907
So what we do now?

41:18.214 --> 41:18.650
John?

41:20.782 --> 41:21.261
JOHN!

41:22.305 --> 41:23.524
Stop messing around.

41:34.230 --> 41:35.580
I didn't mean to shoot you.

41:35.710 --> 41:36.494
By the way.

41:40.889 --> 41:41.890
What was it?

41:42.412 --> 41:43.936
Didn't find anything out of the
ordinary.

41:44.284 --> 41:45.328
Could be the beams?

41:47.243 --> 41:48.680
He's obsessed with beams.

41:50.290 --> 41:50.943
What?

41:53.598 --> 41:55.208
Just keep an ear out.

41:55.338 --> 41:56.862
Let us know if anything else
out of the ordinary happens.

42:00.169 --> 42:01.431
I'm just going to see
if next door has a kit.

42:19.667 --> 42:20.276
Oh come on!

42:20.407 --> 42:21.451
How're we losing 2-0?

42:31.331 --> 42:32.027
I'll be there soon.

42:32.288 --> 42:32.811
How long?

42:33.725 --> 42:34.290
Hard to say...

42:34.813 --> 42:35.335
20?

42:35.422 --> 42:35.988
20!

42:55.790 --> 42:58.401
Do they have first aid kits in
toilets?

43:28.257 --> 43:29.041
Bloody hell!

43:29.171 --> 43:30.172
You haven't got a mixer have ya?

43:32.348 --> 43:33.698
Would you rather a herbal tea?

43:41.401 --> 43:41.967
Okay...

43:44.056 --> 43:45.579
So I'm gonna help you,

43:45.971 --> 43:47.625
but not before you tell me

43:47.755 --> 43:48.843
who you are and what you're
doing here?

44:02.117 --> 44:02.727
Cook.

44:03.162 --> 44:04.032
George Cook.

44:04.685 --> 44:06.469
Was the secret agent response
really necessary?

44:08.602 --> 44:09.472
Well I thought it was
appropriate.

44:13.346 --> 44:17.219
I'm not some Oxford Cambridge
silver spoon COO.

44:19.091 --> 44:20.875
I'm a state school lad
from the land of the Beatles...

44:24.574 --> 44:25.706
and I steal things.

44:34.802 --> 44:35.455
Cook.

44:35.542 --> 44:36.195
You ready?

44:59.044 --> 44:59.958
It's an easy job.

45:01.133 --> 45:02.047
5 mil, no fuss.

45:28.987 --> 45:30.205
...and I steal things

45:32.164 --> 45:34.035
usually while deceiving people.

45:36.124 --> 45:37.560
Kind of like what you do with
your hair.

45:37.647 --> 45:38.605
Don't push me.

45:42.565 --> 45:43.349
Put your hands out.

45:44.480 --> 45:45.264
What?

45:45.394 --> 45:46.482
I still don't trust you.

45:48.528 --> 45:49.398
Come on!

45:52.967 --> 45:53.751
By the way,

45:54.142 --> 45:54.926
I'm only doing this...

45:55.013 --> 45:56.275
Because you fancy me?

45:56.623 --> 45:58.756
Because I've got a conscience!

46:00.670 --> 46:01.410
Hmm.

46:08.243 --> 46:09.767
Are you sure you know what
you're doing?

46:12.160 --> 46:14.684
Oh, okay. Take it easy, easy,
easy.

46:14.815 --> 46:15.381
ARGH!

46:15.990 --> 46:16.425
OH!

46:17.339 --> 46:18.427
OH MY GOD.

46:18.514 --> 46:19.080
Quiet!

46:20.516 --> 46:21.387
Chaa!

46:22.257 --> 46:23.041
You're not very
good with your hands are ya?

46:24.085 --> 46:24.912
I'm nearly there!

46:27.828 --> 46:28.307
OH!

46:36.532 --> 46:38.230
Hopefully that should do it?

46:47.326 --> 46:47.761
Well done Guv.

46:48.588 --> 46:49.415
What for?

46:49.894 --> 46:50.720
What you did back there.

46:51.591 --> 46:52.287
What did I do?

46:53.680 --> 46:54.550
Come on.

46:55.116 --> 46:57.858
Calm, measured, respectful.

46:59.991 --> 47:02.080
You're what every police officer
should aspire to be.

47:03.472 --> 47:04.256
Not really.

47:05.213 --> 47:05.779
Oh,

47:07.041 --> 47:07.999
and modest as well.

47:11.002 --> 47:12.307
You were born to do this.

47:56.090 --> 47:57.004
Funny.

47:58.614 --> 47:59.093
What?

48:00.225 --> 48:01.661
I've never...

48:02.096 --> 48:04.490
kissed a guy I've shot before.

48:06.405 --> 48:07.536
Well there's a first time for
everything.

48:26.991 --> 48:27.556
George?

48:30.211 --> 48:31.299
George?

48:35.825 --> 48:36.261
GEORGE!

48:37.305 --> 48:37.740
George.

48:38.437 --> 48:39.003
Can you hear me?

48:40.918 --> 48:42.528
You passed out, I think you were
dreaming.

48:44.617 --> 48:45.226
Hold on.

48:46.271 --> 48:47.881
Where you sex dreaming?

48:48.012 --> 48:48.708
'Sex dreaming'?

48:49.839 --> 48:51.058
About ME?

48:51.189 --> 48:52.103
As if I'd be 'sex dreaming'
about you.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.369
Where's this pickup of yours
anyway?

48:58.761 --> 49:00.198
He's not answering his phone.

49:00.589 --> 49:01.721
But the police have left at
least.

49:07.248 --> 49:07.683
Hey...

49:10.338 --> 49:11.600
what if we went 50/50?

49:13.602 --> 49:14.603
I should ask for more.

49:14.995 --> 49:16.736
Call it compensation for the
assault.

49:17.258 --> 49:18.129
I'm going to leave now.

49:18.259 --> 49:19.260
Pick up or no pick up.

49:19.391 --> 49:20.740
What's Gates...

49:20.870 --> 49:21.915
giving you...

49:23.308 --> 49:24.787
out of interest?

49:26.964 --> 49:27.834
You know him?

49:33.666 --> 49:36.538
Here's three reasons
why you need to take my offer.

49:37.670 --> 49:38.192
One.

49:39.759 --> 49:41.152
You're in over your head.

49:42.066 --> 49:43.415
You've never done anything like
this
before.

49:45.112 --> 49:46.244
Right...

49:47.375 --> 49:49.290
So why not hand over the Oliver
folder to me?

49:49.682 --> 49:50.813
The career criminal.

49:50.944 --> 49:53.947
Let me get my hands dirty,
lessen the risk.

49:55.209 --> 49:55.644
Two.

49:58.865 --> 49:59.779
You shot me.

50:01.389 --> 50:03.217
Now, that's not just a Section
18 assault.

50:03.348 --> 50:06.046
That's attempted murder, which
carries
a fifteen year minimum sentence.

50:06.742 --> 50:08.179
If I choose to press charges...

50:09.745 --> 50:10.572
which I will.

50:12.444 --> 50:13.053
And three.

50:14.315 --> 50:15.838
The one you really want to hear.

50:19.538 --> 50:21.018
I did work for Gates...

50:22.932 --> 50:24.978
and I know...

50:25.109 --> 50:27.111
that Gates is gonna screw you
over,

50:27.198 --> 50:28.851
as soon as you hand over the
loot.

50:33.726 --> 50:36.120
So what's it going to be?

50:38.600 --> 50:40.254
I think you're more of an
opportunist
than you let on.

50:42.735 --> 50:45.651
This is just a little one
off pay day in between jobs.

50:46.826 --> 50:47.870
Right...

50:48.741 --> 50:51.091
A bonus for someone who's done
things
the RIGHT way

50:51.178 --> 50:53.050
and deserves a little cash
injection.

50:54.442 --> 50:56.575
MAYBE this someone doesn't

50:56.705 --> 50:59.665
want to have to work
twice as hard for half as much.

51:01.319 --> 51:05.279
MAYBE this person deserves to
pay off
thirty grand's worth of student
debt.

51:05.410 --> 51:07.151
You know, the moment

51:07.238 --> 51:09.066
when society punishes you for
studying
and getting good grades?

51:10.197 --> 51:11.764
MAYBE

51:11.894 --> 51:15.507
this person deserves
to put a deposit down on
somewhere

51:15.637 --> 51:18.988
half decent to live in the city
she was BLOODY born in.

51:19.076 --> 51:20.033
And finally get on the property
ladder.

51:20.120 --> 51:21.991
I mean, is that so much to ASK?

51:32.741 --> 51:34.134
Have you given that speech
before?

51:39.487 --> 51:42.577
Every working class
generation gets a raw deal.

51:45.537 --> 51:51.151
My dad died when I was three and
me
Mum couldn't afford to bring me
up so...

51:52.587 --> 51:54.198
I moved in with me Nan.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.288
We didn't have much,
but she made the best of it.

51:57.679 --> 51:59.028
Like her mum and her mum's mum.

52:00.465 --> 52:01.596
We used to play blackjack

52:01.727 --> 52:03.990
and rummy every afternoon after
school.

52:05.252 --> 52:07.298
And she beat me every time.

52:08.386 --> 52:10.649
You know what she used to say
after I lost?

52:12.172 --> 52:13.304
'God loves to try-er'.

52:14.957 --> 52:16.655
And what I thought she meant
was,

52:17.395 --> 52:19.092
is that eventually I get
rewarded.

52:19.179 --> 52:21.050
If I kept putting in efforts
and hard work.

52:23.052 --> 52:24.532
But then I realized

52:25.011 --> 52:26.839
what she actually meant was,

52:27.187 --> 52:28.319
you only win

52:29.233 --> 52:31.452
if you push your luck
and go outside the rules.

52:33.367 --> 52:35.413
She always beat me because she
cheated.

52:37.197 --> 52:38.590
She did what she had to do.

52:41.767 --> 52:44.857
Now I dunno about you,
but I feel totally guilt-free

52:44.987 --> 52:50.210
about taking the access codes
from the accounts containing the
millions

52:50.297 --> 52:53.692
British councils have taken in
undeserved
parking fines since 1986.

52:54.649 --> 52:55.781
Parking fines?

52:56.129 --> 52:57.826
Daylight robbery innit?

52:57.957 --> 53:02.657
No, I mean, Gates said
it was the undiscovered expenses
from MPs,

53:03.571 --> 53:06.487
but then they also said it was
dodgy
banker bonuses...

53:06.618 --> 53:07.358
I don't know.

53:08.620 --> 53:09.186
Oh?

53:13.146 --> 53:13.886
Well...

53:15.235 --> 53:17.106
whatever it is,
could you untie me so I can go
for a wazz?

53:17.237 --> 53:18.325
I'm bursting at the seams here.

53:20.806 --> 53:21.850
What I'm serious!

54:09.115 --> 54:09.985
Oh!

54:13.293 --> 54:14.251
Thank you.

54:32.356 --> 54:33.357
Forget something?

54:51.070 --> 54:53.507
Let's go. Me and you.

54:54.073 --> 54:55.422
It's funny you're offering me
that now.

54:58.251 --> 54:59.078
Unlike you.

54:59.165 --> 55:01.863
I have shot people before...

55:02.777 --> 55:04.518
and I've got no problem doing it
again.

55:07.652 --> 55:10.698
I'm not telling you where it is,
so you might as well just shoot
me.

55:19.054 --> 55:19.446
What's happening?

55:21.492 --> 55:22.057
Can I help you?

55:45.907 --> 55:46.734
Look.

55:47.474 --> 55:49.346
It's either 50/50 or Gates takes
it all.

55:51.130 --> 55:52.392
You're not going to shoot me.

55:52.479 --> 55:53.698
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

55:54.089 --> 55:54.873
You fancy me.

55:55.743 --> 55:56.353
As if.

56:04.970 --> 56:07.320
You know I've spent my entire
life
being a pushover.

56:08.016 --> 56:09.627
For once I'm going to take a
stand.

56:30.952 --> 56:32.214
What are we doing up here?

56:43.443 --> 56:44.401
What are you doing?

56:47.404 --> 56:49.101
Oh, I'm sorry.

56:50.450 --> 56:52.800
Did you fancy waiting in that
room
for when the cops checked it?

57:02.462 --> 57:03.768
Still think it's the beams?

57:06.901 --> 57:07.859
Blimey.

57:09.948 --> 57:11.036
Are you going to pull that
trigger then or what?

57:14.605 --> 57:15.736
Give me the USB.

57:16.694 --> 57:17.434
I already told you.

57:19.261 --> 57:20.001
I'm not going to do that.

57:23.048 --> 57:24.049
I need this money.

57:25.354 --> 57:28.401
I deserve this money.

57:35.756 --> 57:37.236
And I didn't spend
all those years in prison...

57:39.107 --> 57:40.152
just to come out and get done
over

57:40.282 --> 57:40.848
by that posh...

58:08.572 --> 58:09.877
What are you doing here George?

58:22.063 --> 58:22.760
It's a fake.

58:24.588 --> 58:26.111
I've seen the real thing.

58:28.417 --> 58:29.941
And this looks like the real
thing.

58:30.245 --> 58:30.898
What?

58:33.771 --> 58:35.163
Undercover all along.

58:41.605 --> 58:42.736
Is this the stuff?

58:43.824 --> 58:44.869
What do you mean
he was undercover all along?

58:45.826 --> 58:46.914
Long story.

58:47.828 --> 58:50.788
Is this or is this not the
stuff?

58:53.573 --> 58:53.921
No.

58:55.575 --> 58:57.751
Um it's in the herbal tea tins
downstairs.

58:59.100 --> 58:59.579
You what?

59:00.754 --> 59:01.886
Room 1380.

59:04.671 --> 59:05.367
One sec!

59:11.548 --> 59:12.592
Give me that?

59:15.552 --> 59:16.465
What you doing?

59:19.860 --> 59:20.600
Anything to make a copper

59:20.731 --> 59:21.296
look more dumb innit?

59:46.495 --> 59:47.453
I don't think you understand.

59:47.584 --> 59:48.889
I've been given orders.

59:49.020 --> 59:50.717
We need to leave the building
now.

59:54.503 --> 59:56.636
Gunshots to the ceiling,
signs of struggle.

59:56.723 --> 59:58.377
Send forensics to retreive the
bullet.

59:58.507 --> 1:00:01.206
Take bloods and dust the place
really.

1:00:01.336 --> 1:00:03.512
Send some extra squaddies for
security.

1:00:04.165 --> 1:00:05.645
Someone needs to question
the receptionist.

1:00:06.385 --> 1:00:08.039
I'll stay here, make sure
no one contaminates the
evidence.

1:00:12.086 --> 1:00:13.000
How are we going to get past
them?

1:00:43.030 --> 1:00:45.032
You might want to consider a
change of career.

1:00:48.296 --> 1:00:48.949
You know...

1:00:49.863 --> 1:00:50.647
re-train.

1:00:52.387 --> 1:00:53.388
Thanks, Boris.

1:01:06.532 --> 1:01:07.228
It's done.

1:01:08.186 --> 1:01:09.056
Good.

1:01:44.309 --> 1:01:45.136
Did he take it?

1:01:46.180 --> 1:01:46.920
He did.

1:01:49.618 --> 1:01:50.532
Jennifer?

1:01:51.185 --> 1:01:51.925
George?

1:01:53.579 --> 1:01:57.235
Can I buy you a drink sometime?

1:01:59.846 --> 1:02:00.673
That makes a better story

1:02:00.804 --> 1:02:02.153
than swiping right.

1:02:17.342 --> 1:02:19.431
My best friend's
getting married in a couple of
weeks...

1:02:22.564 --> 1:02:23.740
Maybe you'd like some company?

1:02:24.653 --> 1:02:25.742
Maybe I would?

1:02:31.008 --> 1:02:31.530
JENNIFER!

1:02:32.444 --> 1:02:33.010
Jenn!

1:02:34.098 --> 1:02:35.186
Can you hear me?

1:02:42.193 --> 1:02:42.976
Sex dreaming?

1:02:44.238 --> 1:02:45.065
As if.

1:02:46.980 --> 1:02:47.938
We'd better get out of here.

1:02:50.201 --> 1:02:51.289
Bizzies are swarming.

1:02:52.290 --> 1:02:52.899
Hang on?

1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:55.554
Are you a cop or not?

1:03:11.135 --> 1:03:11.918
Take your clothes off.

1:03:14.094 --> 1:03:14.791
We really got time for that?

1:03:14.921 --> 1:03:16.923
Just take your clothes off. Now!

1:03:17.968 --> 1:03:18.838
Why what am I putting on?

1:03:18.925 --> 1:03:19.447
This.

1:03:22.189 --> 1:03:23.451
No, I've got a better idea.

1:03:26.977 --> 1:03:27.891
Should still be...

1:03:32.069 --> 1:03:32.939
I'll put on...

1:03:33.461 --> 1:03:34.680
what I came in with.

1:03:35.376 --> 1:03:37.901
Oh, great idea. Cat burglar
outfit.

1:03:38.031 --> 1:03:39.076
The police won't bat an eyelid.

1:03:41.556 --> 1:03:42.514
You're right.

1:03:50.217 --> 1:03:52.698
Ah, whoah whoah whoah, slow.

1:03:54.091 --> 1:03:55.048
You alright?

1:04:06.668 --> 1:04:07.321
Gimme that....

1:04:08.148 --> 1:04:08.627
This?

1:04:08.757 --> 1:04:09.193
Yeah.

1:04:20.987 --> 1:04:21.901
Stop flexing.

1:04:26.210 --> 1:04:27.515
Stop perving.

1:04:29.517 --> 1:04:30.083
Don't flatter yourself.

1:04:47.709 --> 1:04:49.276
So when you've finished

1:04:49.407 --> 1:04:50.625
cleaning the toilets on every
floor,
I'd like you to

1:04:50.756 --> 1:04:52.671
dust the ceilings thoroughly.

1:04:54.107 --> 1:04:56.762
Oh sorry Officer, I was told
the incident happened on the
4th?

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:58.503
I'm Tara Munis, Vice-President.

1:04:58.633 --> 1:05:00.461
Oh. Pleasure.

1:05:01.419 --> 1:05:03.290
Yeah well it's clear you run a
very tight
and honest ship here so...

1:05:03.900 --> 1:05:06.511
Yes, well, I'm just finishing
showing this one his rounds.

1:05:06.641 --> 1:05:10.254
Erm how about we meet in my
office
in let's say fifteen minutes?

1:05:10.689 --> 1:05:11.342
Lovely.

1:05:11.864 --> 1:05:12.734
Alright, after you.

1:05:12.865 --> 1:05:13.344
Wonderful.

1:05:21.874 --> 1:05:22.919
Same again?

1:05:23.832 --> 1:05:26.270
No. The receptionist's already
seen me.

1:05:29.534 --> 1:05:30.404
That was with your wig on
though...

1:05:31.014 --> 1:05:31.840
Really?

1:05:32.754 --> 1:05:34.191
Well, throw in an accent to
really sell it?

1:05:36.062 --> 1:05:36.933
Risky...

1:05:50.859 --> 1:05:52.383
Madam. It's for your own safety.

1:05:52.470 --> 1:05:54.428
We need you to leave the
building
right now.

1:05:55.168 --> 1:05:57.605
Listen,
I think this is really
unnecessary.

1:05:57.997 --> 1:05:59.433
I've been given orders.

1:05:59.564 --> 1:06:01.044
We need to leave the building.

1:06:01.174 --> 1:06:03.307
It's for your own safety.
Please,
will you follow me?

1:06:03.437 --> 1:06:04.830
I'm not leaving the desk.

1:06:05.918 --> 1:06:07.180
Don't you think you're just
overreacting
just a little bit?

1:06:10.357 --> 1:06:11.880
No, we need to leave now.

1:06:16.885 --> 1:06:17.538
High risk,

1:06:19.236 --> 1:06:20.150
high reward.

1:06:21.890 --> 1:06:23.588
Brandy Harris C.I.D.

1:06:23.980 --> 1:06:25.068
Great work today, officers.

1:06:26.373 --> 1:06:27.113
Wait.

1:06:28.158 --> 1:06:29.594
I've met you before.

1:06:29.942 --> 1:06:31.639
Your name's Tara?

1:06:31.770 --> 1:06:32.597
Tara something.

1:06:34.816 --> 1:06:35.992
Everything okay here?

1:06:38.646 --> 1:06:40.170
Do we all look the same to you
then?

1:06:42.781 --> 1:06:44.391
What?

1:06:44.522 --> 1:06:46.089
Nice bit of racial
profiling on a Wednesday
afternoon.

1:06:48.308 --> 1:06:49.309
No.

1:06:50.919 --> 1:06:52.573
Lucky for you, we have a bigger
incident to investigate, don't
we officer?

1:06:52.921 --> 1:06:53.574
Yes, ma'am.

1:06:54.140 --> 1:06:56.490
Well, this one's a bit shaken
up,

1:06:57.491 --> 1:06:59.580
so I'm gonna take him for a
coffee
and you're gonna give me a
statement.

1:06:59.711 --> 1:07:00.320
Aren't you Dimitri?

1:07:03.106 --> 1:07:05.978
Yesh... da, da.

1:07:06.109 --> 1:07:07.588
Although I have not yet finished
ze

1:07:08.763 --> 1:07:11.027
cleaning of ze toilets.

1:07:11.984 --> 1:07:13.333
Is this okay?

1:07:14.073 --> 1:07:15.727
You've been through enough,
Dimitri.

1:07:16.423 --> 1:07:16.858
Let's go.

1:07:16.989 --> 1:07:17.381
Come on.

1:08:23.534 --> 1:08:25.231
What about appreciation?

1:08:28.191 --> 1:08:29.888
You want me to stand on my
doorstep
and clap for you?

1:08:31.716 --> 1:08:32.499
Is that what you want?

1:08:44.859 --> 1:08:46.383
So you're not giving me a bonus
then?

1:08:46.470 --> 1:08:48.036
For being undercover
for the best part of three
years?

1:08:49.951 --> 1:08:51.301
Sorry, you're out.

1:08:51.431 --> 1:08:52.824
Empty handed.

1:09:02.877 --> 1:09:04.314
Can I just ask ya one thing?

1:09:07.186 --> 1:09:10.537
The account numbers and pin
codes stolen
and put onto the USB.

1:09:12.626 --> 1:09:15.890
I was told it was parking
fine profits from councils

1:09:17.109 --> 1:09:19.546
but then, I heard it was

1:09:19.677 --> 1:09:22.201
illegal funds from banker
bonuses

1:09:23.898 --> 1:09:24.812
and then

1:09:25.987 --> 1:09:28.468
I heard it was a secret stash

1:09:28.599 --> 1:09:30.644
from MPs expenses...

1:09:31.602 --> 1:09:32.864
Is there a question in there
somewhere?

1:09:35.475 --> 1:09:36.433
Well, which one was it?

1:09:43.875 --> 1:09:45.050
You're not on the payroll
anymore.

1:09:48.184 --> 1:09:49.228
Why would I tell you?

1:10:15.036 --> 1:10:16.212
Last day tomorrow.

1:10:17.909 --> 1:10:18.823
I'm sorry, Mum.

1:10:19.998 --> 1:10:21.260
It's not your fault.

1:10:21.565 --> 1:10:22.870
I should have been able to help.

1:10:24.089 --> 1:10:25.482
Don't be stupid.

1:10:25.612 --> 1:10:27.397
I should have been able to help
YOU.

1:10:27.788 --> 1:10:29.355
Mums are supposed to do that.

1:10:39.583 --> 1:10:40.453
Come on, Mum.

1:11:03.389 --> 1:11:04.521
So, yeah,

1:11:05.217 --> 1:11:06.262
that's the long and short of it.

1:11:09.787 --> 1:11:11.876
Oh. My. God.

1:11:12.268 --> 1:11:13.312
You can't tell anyone, though.

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:15.271
Who do you think I am?

1:11:17.142 --> 1:11:18.099
I don't know what I'm going to
do.

1:11:18.230 --> 1:11:18.970
Seriously.

1:11:20.754 --> 1:11:22.016
Ask him if he's free on the
23rd?

1:11:23.975 --> 1:11:24.628
Joking.

1:11:25.890 --> 1:11:26.891
Or am I?

1:11:27.021 --> 1:11:27.674
Lolz?

1:11:28.980 --> 1:11:29.763
What would you do, though?

1:11:30.590 --> 1:11:31.199
Really?

1:11:34.942 --> 1:11:36.727
So the bad guy screwed you over?

1:11:37.815 --> 1:11:40.121
You went in with nothing,
came out with nothing.

1:11:40.774 --> 1:11:41.819
But you did shoot this guy?

1:11:42.428 --> 1:11:43.951
Yeah...

1:11:44.082 --> 1:11:45.736
And you did attempt
to steal millions of pounds...

1:11:48.391 --> 1:11:52.482
But if this piece of white
chocolate is a con artist?

1:11:53.178 --> 1:11:54.614
Then I don't think
you have anything to worry
about.

1:11:54.745 --> 1:11:55.572
And if he's a cop?

1:11:56.312 --> 1:11:58.444
Then you better hope and pray
he fancies you...

1:11:58.923 --> 1:12:02.056
like early nineties jungle fever
vibes.

1:12:02.970 --> 1:12:04.798
We're gonna need some more wine
then!

1:12:08.106 --> 1:12:08.846
So this is the spot?

1:12:24.644 --> 1:12:25.732
Not bad.

1:12:26.951 --> 1:12:28.996
I could show you a few rooftops
better than this though.

1:12:31.434 --> 1:12:32.260
How's your shoulder?

1:12:32.652 --> 1:12:33.523
Hurt's like a bastard.

1:12:34.567 --> 1:12:35.263
Sorry.

1:12:43.663 --> 1:12:45.273
Wait, you have the red USB?

1:12:46.100 --> 1:12:46.927
I do.

1:12:47.319 --> 1:12:48.538
But I checked your pockets?

1:12:48.668 --> 1:12:49.147
Okay?

1:12:49.974 --> 1:12:50.627
You alright?

1:12:52.846 --> 1:12:53.717
I had a feeling you would.

1:12:57.764 --> 1:12:58.852
So I stashed it.

1:13:00.027 --> 1:13:00.941
You went back in?

1:13:01.333 --> 1:13:02.073
Nope.

1:13:04.031 --> 1:13:06.991
I had a trusty receptionist.

1:13:21.484 --> 1:13:23.181
She was working with you the
entire time.

1:13:25.488 --> 1:13:27.228
Little insurance never hurt
anymore.

1:13:27.968 --> 1:13:29.317
Well no wonder you got into the
building
so easily.

1:13:29.448 --> 1:13:30.406
You walked right through
reception.

1:13:32.190 --> 1:13:33.147
Oh...

1:13:33.278 --> 1:13:35.062
No, I came in through the
rooftop.

1:13:35.454 --> 1:13:37.325
You came in from the roof?

1:13:38.022 --> 1:13:41.068
Yeah, I told you. It's kinda my
thing.

1:13:43.331 --> 1:13:43.941
So about that then.

1:13:44.071 --> 1:13:44.463
Did you erm...

1:13:45.856 --> 1:13:46.247
happen to?

1:13:46.378 --> 1:13:47.118
Yeah I did.

1:13:49.990 --> 1:13:53.559
And it turns out some people can

1:13:53.951 --> 1:13:56.997
write over data so that it's
hidden

1:13:58.477 --> 1:13:59.826
but still on the drive.

1:14:01.219 --> 1:14:02.438
Little programmer trick.

1:14:13.274 --> 1:14:15.059
So Gates will have received...

1:14:15.755 --> 1:14:18.628
A copy of the 'Oliver' folder
with nothing on it.

1:14:46.090 --> 1:14:47.526
How did you know that Big Al
would...

1:14:48.309 --> 1:14:49.093
Took a risk.

1:14:55.360 --> 1:14:56.666
So is it true what they say
then?

1:14:57.536 --> 1:14:59.886
Is it all Xbox's and slap up
meals?

1:15:05.805 --> 1:15:06.327
Where?

1:15:06.458 --> 1:15:07.111
Prison.

1:15:10.331 --> 1:15:11.594
I'm glad you find it so funny.

1:15:13.813 --> 1:15:15.293
You know what I DO find funny,
though?

1:15:20.907 --> 1:15:22.996
That I'm going to offer half of
this to...

1:15:23.475 --> 1:15:24.476
someone who shot me.

1:15:25.956 --> 1:15:26.391
Wait?

1:15:27.305 --> 1:15:28.262
So you're not police?

1:15:29.568 --> 1:15:30.351
Not anymore.

1:15:30.917 --> 1:15:31.527
Anymore?

1:15:33.354 --> 1:15:34.094
They let me go.

1:15:36.967 --> 1:15:40.187
Well it looks like you're going
to have to re-train.

1:15:42.059 --> 1:15:42.581
Hmm.

1:15:44.409 --> 1:15:46.106
I've heard Switzerland's a great
place?

1:15:47.151 --> 1:15:47.760
I heard that too.

1:15:49.675 --> 1:15:51.503
Do you think they'll
have gin on the plane?

1:15:53.549 --> 1:15:54.375
I should hope so.

1:15:58.466 --> 1:15:59.380
So...

1:16:00.686 --> 1:16:01.774
Are we doing this then?

1:16:02.645 --> 1:16:03.776
It certainly looks that way,
doesn't it?

1:16:30.455 --> 1:16:31.499
Stop everything else.

1:16:35.765 --> 1:16:37.375
I want them found

1:16:38.419 --> 1:16:39.464
and brought to me.

1:16:52.564 --> 1:16:55.393
And bring me a fresh fucking
margarita!

1:17:25.118 --> 1:17:26.424
Make it quick, I'm very busy.

1:17:27.468 --> 1:17:29.122
Thank you, Mrs. Boomer.

1:17:29.253 --> 1:17:31.298
But your services are no longer
required.

1:17:33.213 --> 1:17:34.040
What?

1:17:35.172 --> 1:17:37.478
I came into a bit of money
and I decided to invest in FWP

1:17:39.698 --> 1:17:40.960
As the majority shareholder.

1:17:43.528 --> 1:17:44.834
What's going on?

1:17:44.964 --> 1:17:45.573
Don't worry.

1:17:46.226 --> 1:17:47.532
I'm sure you'll find something.

1:17:58.282 --> 1:17:58.848
That bitch!

1:18:15.995 --> 1:18:16.692
Cool beans?

1:18:19.259 --> 1:18:20.217
Cool beans.

1:18:25.178 --> 1:18:28.268
So there's been something
I've been meaning to ask you...

1:18:30.401 --> 1:18:33.491
Was the whole
'Brandy-the-fiance'
story real?

1:18:37.103 --> 1:18:39.018
Her name really was 'Brandy'

1:18:41.020 --> 1:18:43.370
and she kind of broke

1:18:43.501 --> 1:18:44.545
my heart to be honest.

1:18:50.769 --> 1:18:52.292
Haven't dated anyone since.

1:18:53.163 --> 1:18:53.990
Why not?

1:18:57.515 --> 1:18:58.995
Hmm.

1:19:04.348 --> 1:19:05.436
Scared.

1:19:30.896 --> 1:19:32.028
So...

1:19:32.680 --> 1:19:33.551
something I've been meaning
to ask you.

1:19:37.773 --> 1:19:40.384
How come you can do a perfect
Liverpool accent?

1:19:41.472 --> 1:19:42.299
The mother.

1:19:43.343 --> 1:19:44.344
What she's?

1:19:44.475 --> 1:19:45.389
She is.

1:19:55.268 --> 1:19:56.574
When do you think we can go
back?

1:20:03.624 --> 1:20:04.582
A couple of weeks should do it.

1:20:05.757 --> 1:20:07.106
Well...

1:20:07.237 --> 1:20:09.543
In that case,
I have a proposition for you.

1:20:10.501 --> 1:20:13.634
My best friend is getting
hitched
and I was wondering

1:20:13.765 --> 1:20:15.898
if you wanted to be my plus one?

1:20:19.771 --> 1:20:20.598
I erm...

1:20:27.257 --> 1:20:30.129
think it's probably best we go
our separate ways after this.

1:20:31.739 --> 1:20:32.262
Oh.

1:20:44.100 --> 1:20:44.883
For the best?

1:20:47.233 --> 1:20:47.625
Okay.

1:20:48.626 --> 1:20:49.105
Cool...

1:20:50.497 --> 1:20:51.020
Cool beans.

1:21:06.862 --> 1:21:07.993
What a u-turn.

1:21:08.124 --> 1:21:08.689
I know.

1:21:08.820 --> 1:21:09.734
What happened?

1:21:10.300 --> 1:21:11.910
It's not that big of a deal,
Mum.

1:21:12.041 --> 1:21:14.826
Family and friends,
a thousand people, one single
stranger.

1:21:14.957 --> 1:21:16.001
It's all terrifying!

1:21:16.088 --> 1:21:17.089
You want me to do this or not?

1:21:17.350 --> 1:21:18.874
Look at her, she's made up.

1:21:19.700 --> 1:21:21.267
I'm going to go for a quick puff
before...

1:21:21.354 --> 1:21:23.661
Should never have started
that habit in the first place.

1:21:43.637 --> 1:21:44.377
Size seven?

1:21:45.378 --> 1:21:46.249
What?

1:21:46.336 --> 1:21:47.728
The ruby slipper.

1:21:48.729 --> 1:21:49.905
Yes, I know it's a ruby slipper
but what are you doing with it?

1:21:50.601 --> 1:21:51.297
Oh.

1:21:51.428 --> 1:21:51.994
Err.

1:21:52.559 --> 1:21:54.735
You know, Anne Boleyn?

1:21:57.086 --> 1:21:58.696
So Gates uses that line on
everyone?

1:21:59.218 --> 1:22:00.480
Pretty much.

1:22:01.177 --> 1:22:04.789
And I'm wearing a Henry cod
piece.

1:22:06.051 --> 1:22:07.879
Can't you just enter the venue
like a normal person?

1:22:09.663 --> 1:22:10.926
No...

1:22:13.319 --> 1:22:14.103
You can get up now.

1:22:34.123 --> 1:22:35.341
Still need a plus-one?

1:22:37.126 --> 1:22:37.953
I thought you said it'd be best

1:22:38.083 --> 1:22:39.302
if we go our separate ways?

1:22:42.087 --> 1:22:42.827
That was a lie.

1:22:44.437 --> 1:22:45.134
And how did you even...

1:22:49.529 --> 1:22:51.531
I've got skills haven't I?

1:22:52.750 --> 1:22:55.013
And by skills
he means he asked me for the
address.

1:22:55.144 --> 1:22:56.232
And you just gave it to him?

1:22:56.362 --> 1:22:57.624
Oh, come on.

1:22:58.060 --> 1:23:00.714
I know he's your Mr. White
Choco...

1:23:00.801 --> 1:23:02.934
Don't you dare finish that
sentence!

1:23:04.022 --> 1:23:04.631
What?

1:23:05.589 --> 1:23:07.417
We have a nickname for you,
I'll let her tell you.

1:23:08.113 --> 1:23:08.984
So MUM...

1:23:10.202 --> 1:23:11.725
how's the salon?

1:23:12.465 --> 1:23:14.859
Business is booming
and the customers love the
renovations.

1:23:15.773 --> 1:23:16.252
Thank you.

1:23:18.732 --> 1:23:20.734
Hey, how much to charge for a
Scouse perm?

1:23:21.039 --> 1:23:22.258
I could do with a new look.

1:23:23.041 --> 1:23:26.044
If you let me give you a Scouse
perm,
it'll be on the house.

1:23:26.175 --> 1:23:28.046
Oh, don't encourage him please!

1:23:33.399 --> 1:23:34.531
You gonna get your plus-one a
bevvy or?

1:23:35.488 --> 1:23:37.838
I haven't confirmed or denied
whether you're actually my
plus-one.

1:23:41.103 --> 1:23:43.322
You don't know
what you're getting yourself
into.

1:23:43.453 --> 1:23:44.236
Hmm.

1:23:45.977 --> 1:23:47.109
Champers?

1:23:47.805 --> 1:23:48.806
Or gin?

1:23:49.763 --> 1:23:50.851
Is there going to be a mixer
this time?

1:23:54.290 --> 1:23:55.465
Come on.

1:24:12.482 --> 1:24:14.571
Starting to think
I might be open to marriage
again.

1:24:15.006 --> 1:24:15.746
Really?

1:24:17.356 --> 1:24:18.618
Well...

1:24:21.665 --> 1:24:24.407
Crucial question,
though, who's playing the
reception?

1:24:24.537 --> 1:24:27.062
112, Jagged Edge, Dru Hill

1:24:27.192 --> 1:24:28.802
or Black Street?

1:24:30.630 --> 1:24:31.457
All four.

1:24:33.111 --> 1:24:34.460
Crucial question for you
though...

1:24:35.026 --> 1:24:35.809
Yeah?

1:24:37.159 --> 1:24:39.987
Are there actually,
any women who would want to
marry you?

1:24:42.207 --> 1:24:43.600
I hope your speech bombs.

1:24:43.730 --> 1:24:44.775
And I hope you get shot in your
other shoulder.

1:25:01.879 --> 1:25:02.358
Jenn...

1:25:03.141 --> 1:25:03.750
Yeah?

1:25:06.231 --> 1:25:07.319
You're going to knock it out the
park.

1:25:10.322 --> 1:25:11.367
Just to check...

1:25:12.281 --> 1:25:14.239
this is just a one off
partnership, right?

1:25:19.592 --> 1:25:20.027
Yeah.

1:25:20.724 --> 1:25:21.464
Absolutely yeah.

1:25:23.727 --> 1:25:24.554
Total one off.

1:25:27.252 --> 1:25:28.123
Peaches and cream.

1:26:24.048 --> 1:26:24.875
Yeah she's a stunner mate.

1:26:25.310 --> 1:26:25.963
She is.

1:26:26.485 --> 1:26:27.921
Naughty as well right?

1:26:28.835 --> 1:26:30.359
She makes me dress up in uniform
for her.

1:26:32.665 --> 1:26:33.144
Nice.

1:26:35.451 --> 1:26:36.191
What type of uniform?
