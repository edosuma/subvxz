00:01.653 --> 00:04.265
<i>Previously on</i>
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.308 --> 00:06.267
How did you do
on your MCAT practice test?

00:06.310 --> 00:08.573
I didn't have
a chance to take it yet.

00:08.617 --> 00:10.140
I thought you were doing it
last week.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.360
Yes, but work was very busy.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.492
And then Bob wanted to take me
to see a movie.

00:14.536 --> 00:17.060
Uh-uh! A movie?

00:17.104 --> 00:19.236
Yes, it was date night.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.238
Mom, your studies
should always come

00:21.282 --> 00:23.284
before dating and lollygagging.

00:23.327 --> 00:27.070
- Yes, Dele.
- At this rate, I'll become a doctor before you.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.116
Yes, Dele.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.727
<i>E kasaan,</i> Mum.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.555
- Dele?
- Surprise!

00:33.598 --> 00:35.470
Oh, Dele, my baby boy.

00:35.513 --> 00:39.256
- I've missed you so much.
- I've missed you, too.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.041
I don't understand--
how did you get here?

00:41.084 --> 00:42.433
Abishola?
Mummy.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.827
I see you have gained weight
since the wedding.

00:46.829 --> 00:49.005
Surprise.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.573
I still cannot believe
you're here in Detroit.

00:51.616 --> 00:54.141
It was nice
to finally be invited.

00:54.184 --> 00:57.361
Although it would've been nice
to know you were coming...

00:57.405 --> 00:59.015
ahead of time.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.104
That would've ruined
the surprise.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.106
Yes, it would have.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.108
Mummy, would you like

01:05.152 --> 01:06.979
to visit the hospital
and see where I work?

01:07.023 --> 01:08.764
Are you a doctor yet?
No.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.722
I will visit
when you are a doctor.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.598
Unacceptable!

01:16.641 --> 01:18.295
These are not the test scores
of a future doctor!

01:18.339 --> 01:20.254
They're really
not that bad.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.517
These are the scores
of drug addicts

01:22.560 --> 01:24.997
and chiropractors!

01:25.041 --> 01:27.304
I'm sure Dele
tried his best.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.524
Not him. Her.

01:29.567 --> 01:32.135
My MCAT results.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.615
It was a 519.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.486
519?

01:35.530 --> 01:37.488
I have no idea what that means.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.490
It means she did not
study hard enough.

01:39.534 --> 01:42.145
I am sorry, Mummy.
I can do better.
How?

01:42.189 --> 01:44.147
By sitting around,
arguing with me?

01:44.191 --> 01:45.496
No, by studying harder.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.629
That is right.

01:47.672 --> 01:49.631
Did I say
you could go?

01:49.674 --> 01:51.720
No, Mummy.

01:52.895 --> 01:54.026
Now you may go.

01:54.070 --> 01:55.506
Yes, Mummy.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.856
Not so fast, I am
still shouting at you.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.684
Yes, Mummy.

01:59.728 --> 02:02.252
That was kind of hard
to watch, huh?

02:02.296 --> 02:03.514
Yeah.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.125
Are you smiling?

02:05.168 --> 02:06.430
Yeah.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.719
Hey.

02:34.763 --> 02:35.764
Hello.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.461
You okay?
No.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.376
Yeah, I kind of figured.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.161
Your mom really did
a number on you.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.640
I did a number on myself.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.251
I let everyone down.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.383
You didn't let me down.

02:46.427 --> 02:48.168
That's because you don't know
any better.

02:50.082 --> 02:52.911
I came here to be supportive.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.478
That is the problem.

02:54.522 --> 02:56.741
You think I can do no wrong.

02:56.785 --> 02:59.179
And I started to believe it.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.746
Okay, no more
compliments.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.095
That would be helpful.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.624
So you are not going
to say anything?

03:09.667 --> 03:11.800
All I can think of are nice
things. It's gonna take a while.

03:11.843 --> 03:14.455
This is just a small setback.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.631
I'm going to take
the MCAT again.

03:16.674 --> 03:19.024
And I'm going to be accepted
into Johns Hopkins.

03:19.068 --> 03:22.071
Yeah, and if not, there are
plenty of other great schools.

03:22.114 --> 03:24.552
No, there is only Johns Hopkins.

03:24.595 --> 03:27.511
Wait, the Baltimore
Johns Hopkins?

03:27.555 --> 03:30.035
Yes, they have
the best medical school.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.602
Why would I go
anywhere else?

03:32.734 --> 03:35.215
Maybe to live closer
to your husband?

03:35.258 --> 03:37.391
You will move there
in my fourth year.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.958
That will give you enough time
to step back from MaxDot.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.440
What are you talking about?

03:43.484 --> 03:45.225
Our future.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.618
Well, when were you gonna
run <i>our</i> future by me?

03:47.662 --> 03:49.751
- I did run it by you.
- When?

03:49.794 --> 03:51.274
When I told you I want
to become a doctor.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.754
Well, what if I don't want you
to go to Baltimore?

03:52.797 --> 03:54.712
- So you are forbidding me?
- No!

03:54.756 --> 03:56.410
I just think
we should discuss this.

03:56.453 --> 03:57.889
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.891
- Do you want me to be a doctor?
- Yes.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.937
Then I am going to Baltimore--
end of discussion.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.462
I don't think you know
how a discussion works.

04:07.377 --> 04:10.032
So, what, I'm just supposed
to become a Ravens fan now?

04:10.075 --> 04:12.208
Are they not a better team?

04:12.252 --> 04:14.254
Okay, that's a low blow.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.866
Sounds like there's trouble
in paradise.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.998
Another marital problem
that we will have

04:20.042 --> 04:21.870
to help them navigate.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.741
- They're so lucky to have us.
- Mm.

04:23.785 --> 04:26.178
When I was a newlywed,
there was nothing to navigate.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.006
You just did what your husband
said and you made sure

04:28.050 --> 04:29.486
he never saw you
without makeup.

04:29.530 --> 04:32.924
My husband still has never
seen my naked face.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.362
- Really?
- I sleep in full makeup

04:35.405 --> 04:38.103
and a girdle.

04:38.147 --> 04:40.367
Max's funeral
was a sad day.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.804
But not having to
wear a bra to bed

04:42.847 --> 04:44.893
was a game changer.
Mm.

04:44.936 --> 04:47.025
We are good wives.

04:47.069 --> 04:49.158
And damn good mothers.
Mm.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.160
I've seen you in action.

04:51.203 --> 04:53.031
I like your style.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.598
And I yours.

04:54.642 --> 04:57.209
I find your use
of money and guilt

04:57.253 --> 04:59.734
very intriguing.

04:59.777 --> 05:03.346
You work with the
- tools you have.
- Mm.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.783
I've seen you get the job done
with just your voice.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.046
It took many beatings

05:08.090 --> 05:10.397
to get to that point.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.399
Hard work pays off.

05:21.190 --> 05:24.019
Did you know Dr. Michaels
went to Wake Forest?

05:24.062 --> 05:26.978
That's too bad, I
used to respect him.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.632
What's wrong with Wake Forest?

05:28.676 --> 05:30.330
It sounds like a place
where they teach you

05:30.373 --> 05:32.462
how to operate on chipmunks.

05:32.506 --> 05:35.378
Who cares where
he got his degree?

05:35.422 --> 05:37.119
Oh, so you want your heart
surgeon to be a graduate

05:37.162 --> 05:39.948
of Chuck E. Cheese
University?

05:39.991 --> 05:42.298
My mother said
if I don't go to Johns Hopkins,

05:42.342 --> 05:44.866
I might as well be a prostitute.

05:44.909 --> 05:47.390
They are both equally
embarrassing.

05:47.434 --> 05:51.481
But you're not becoming a doctor
to please your mother.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.876
Of course I am.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.269
What other reason
could there be?

05:57.313 --> 05:59.271
To help people.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.230
I could've sworn she
was going to say money.

06:01.273 --> 06:03.580
That would have been
a good point.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.103
I was gonna be a doctor,

06:05.147 --> 06:06.975
but it wasn't because of my mom,

06:07.018 --> 06:08.280
or the money.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.239
It was because the human body

06:10.282 --> 06:11.893
is an amazing thing.

06:11.936 --> 06:14.591
I would hold
the power of life and death

06:14.635 --> 06:16.419
in my own two hands.

06:17.942 --> 06:20.858
You sound like a serial killer.

06:22.164 --> 06:23.948
Who went to Wake Forest.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.824
And now I believe it is time

06:29.867 --> 06:32.609
for a presentation
from our new head of marketing.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.568
Why didn't I get that job?

06:34.611 --> 06:36.308
Do you really want me
to go into it?

06:36.352 --> 06:38.572
No.

06:38.615 --> 06:39.790
Go ahead, Kofo.

06:41.226 --> 06:44.447
We know compression socks
improve circulation

06:44.491 --> 06:47.058
during air travel,
so I am proposing

06:47.102 --> 06:49.626
we begin to sell
our products in airports.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.932
Interesting.

06:50.975 --> 06:53.325
A hurried business traveler,
making their way

06:53.369 --> 06:55.850
through the concourse,
spots a colorful kiosk.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.983
"MaxDot socks.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.811
Come fly with us."

07:00.855 --> 07:02.726
Ooh, sexy.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.728
I am threatened and jealous.

07:04.772 --> 07:07.122
That means it is a good idea.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.863
I like it, too. Let's do it.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.995
Hang on, you can't just
make a call like that

07:11.039 --> 07:12.475
without discussing it.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.694
What's to discuss?

07:13.737 --> 07:15.260
You heard your brother,
it's sexy.

07:15.304 --> 07:18.089
You have any idea how much
something like that might cost?

07:18.133 --> 07:19.917
The initial investment
would be minimal.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.267
Yeah, and then what, huh?
You can make

07:22.311 --> 07:24.182
all the plans you want, doesn't
mean they're gonna happen

07:24.226 --> 07:27.359
that way--
actions have consequences!

07:27.403 --> 07:29.666
The projected costs are
on page five.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.494
Fine.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.496
You got all the answers,
you clearly don't need me here.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.193
Do your own meeting.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.022
What was that about?

07:38.066 --> 07:40.111
Baltimore.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.728
- <i>E kaale,</i> Mummy.
- What are you doing?

07:47.771 --> 07:49.904
- Studying.
- Where is dinner?

07:49.947 --> 07:52.384
- I have not started it.
- Bob will be home soon.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.561
He can wait.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.780
Oh, no.

07:56.824 --> 08:00.088
Another man is going
to divorce you.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.829
I will just order him takeout.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.700
You would let
your husband

08:03.744 --> 08:07.138
be fed by a pimply teenager
in a paper hat?

08:07.182 --> 08:10.011
Fine, I'll stop studying
and start dinner.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.665
I did not say stop studying.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.494
You can read and stir
at the same time.

08:14.537 --> 08:17.061
- What if I cannot?
- Then you will kill your mother with shame.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.542
- Mummy!
- I can see my obituary now.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.110
"Ebunoluwa Adebisi Odegbami

08:22.153 --> 08:25.243
"is survived

08:25.287 --> 08:28.725
Twice divorced
and still not a doctor."

08:42.304 --> 08:43.827
Your patient appears
stable, Doctor.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.350
I will make the incision.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.091
Scalpel.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.224
Clamp.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.530
Beans.
Beans?

08:50.573 --> 08:53.663
That's the timer
for your beans.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.883
Please, I need to focus
on the surgery.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.449
Are you sure?

08:57.493 --> 08:59.234
I smell something burning.

08:59.277 --> 09:02.106
Okay. Stay right here.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.152
Are you just going
to cut me open and leave?

09:04.195 --> 09:05.588
Ah, Mummy. One moment.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.285
I can't do everything at once.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.636
Why not? I could.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.072
The patient is flatlining!

09:11.115 --> 09:13.596
- Are you satisfied? I am dying!
- No, no, no, no, no!

09:13.640 --> 09:15.250
And now your beans
are flatlining.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.905
- I will fix it!
- Are we gonna have dinner any time soon?

09:17.948 --> 09:21.430
Forget about me!
- Your husband is starving!
- Abishola!

09:21.473 --> 09:22.866
- Abishola.
- Abishola.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.651
Abishola.
Abishola. Abishola.

09:24.694 --> 09:27.175
Oluwa mi o. What? What is it?

09:28.350 --> 09:30.352
I just had a horrible dream.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.441
You want to talk about it?

09:32.484 --> 09:35.966
Do you think I'm taking on
too much responsibility?

09:36.010 --> 09:37.664
Oh, yeah.

09:37.707 --> 09:38.969
What?

09:39.013 --> 09:41.276
But you can handle it.

09:41.319 --> 09:43.147
You're like a sports car.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.149
You're not meant
to drive regular streets.

09:45.193 --> 09:48.283
You're at your best burning
through a curve at Talladega.

09:48.326 --> 09:50.851
I do not understand
any of that,

09:50.894 --> 09:52.548
but thank you.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.509
Why are you dreaming?
You should be studying.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.961
<i>Karo,</i> Bob. <i>E karo,</i> Mama Ebun.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.919
Something smells delicious.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.573
Your lunch.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.967
Pounded yam and okra soup.

10:20.010 --> 10:21.795
Thank you.
That certainly beats

10:21.838 --> 10:25.537
the vending machine snack medley
I was gonna eat.

10:25.581 --> 10:28.062
No man with a wife should be
eating from a vending machine.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.541
Eh, it's not bad.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.587
The right combination
of beef jerky and corn chips

10:31.631 --> 10:35.286
will give you a stomachache that
lasts right up until dinnertime.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.811
Abishola should be making
your lunch every day.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.204
I am perfectly capable
of feeding myself

10:40.248 --> 10:42.903
long as my dollar's
not too wrinkled.

10:42.946 --> 10:46.210
Do not worry. I know Abishola
has been neglecting you,

10:46.254 --> 10:47.995
and I have spoken to her.

10:48.038 --> 10:50.214
Thank you, but we're fine.

10:50.258 --> 10:53.000
Bob, please,
you can be honest with me.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.610
- I am.
- You are not.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.613
Okay. Well, you know
how I feel better than I do.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.268
That is right. So, from now on,

11:00.311 --> 11:03.271
I will see to it
that she cooks you a full meal

11:03.314 --> 11:05.273
to take to work every day.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.753
You don't need to see to that.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.319
Oh, but I do.

11:09.843 --> 11:13.411
No, you don't. Abishola's job
isn't to take care of me.

11:13.455 --> 11:14.674
It certainly is.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.676
Listen, all due respect,

11:16.719 --> 11:19.287
but Abishola and I
don't need your help.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.462
Is that so?

11:20.505 --> 11:22.116
I'm not trying to offend you.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.509
I just think
we can handle this ourselves.

11:24.553 --> 11:25.989
I see.

11:26.816 --> 11:27.774
Enjoy your jerky.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.427
Aah!

11:37.871 --> 11:40.961
Is it okay if I study in here?
The grannies are out there

11:41.004 --> 11:43.964
talking about which foods
give them gas.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.488
Oh, no. A boy
should not have to hear that.

11:46.531 --> 11:47.968
Come in.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.713
Is that biochemistry?

11:53.756 --> 11:54.714
Yep.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.890
I hate biochemistry.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.979
Me, too.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.330
What would you do

12:02.373 --> 12:04.549
if I did not want you
to become a doctor?

12:05.550 --> 12:07.639
Whatever you wanted me to do.

12:07.683 --> 12:10.730
Yes, but what if it was
your decision?

12:11.774 --> 12:13.776
- A lawyer.
- Why?

12:13.820 --> 12:16.910
Because that's what you said
your second choice was.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.999
Forget about what I want.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.610
I don't know how to do that.

12:21.653 --> 12:24.265
If you could be anything,
what would you be?

12:24.308 --> 12:26.615
- Anything?
- Yes.

12:28.008 --> 12:31.881
Well, I guess hypothetically,

12:31.925 --> 12:34.536
I would move to New York

12:34.579 --> 12:36.756
and see if I can get
into a dance program.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.236
Hypothetically.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.282
A dance program?

12:42.283 --> 12:45.852
NYU has a choreography degree
that only takes three years.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.854
So, when people ask me,
"What does Dele do?"

12:47.897 --> 12:51.379
I'm supposed to say, "He's
in New York learning to gyrate"?

12:54.251 --> 12:55.557
I have reconsidered.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.994
I would be a lawyer.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.517
This is why I decide for you.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.258
You are too wishy-washy.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.831
Ugh.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.877
Come in.

13:11.965 --> 13:15.359
Mr. Wheeler, these are ready
for your signature.

13:15.403 --> 13:18.319
When you see Kofo,
tell him I want to talk to him.

13:18.362 --> 13:19.711
You do not need
to talk to him.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.322
I already yelled at him again

13:21.365 --> 13:23.498
for having such a stupid idea.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.761
It wasn't a stupid idea.
I just got some stuff

13:25.805 --> 13:27.241
- going on at home.
- And as the boss,

13:27.284 --> 13:29.069
it is your right
to take that out

13:29.112 --> 13:31.071
on your underlings.

13:31.114 --> 13:34.422
Abishola wants to go
to med school in Baltimore.

13:34.465 --> 13:35.989
Of course, Johns Hopkins.

13:36.032 --> 13:38.382
That is where my daughter
is going.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.775
You got a kid in college?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.690
Preschool.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.780
Abishola's
just gonna leave me here.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.608
That will be very difficult
for her.

13:46.651 --> 13:47.783
- For her?
- Yes.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.872
She is the one
leaving her family.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.222
I was away from my wife
for four years

13:52.266 --> 13:53.484
when I first came to America.

13:53.528 --> 13:54.746
I didn't know that.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.618
Abishola will be
in a city she does not know,

13:56.661 --> 13:59.621
studying all day
and coming home to no one.

13:59.664 --> 14:02.058
I mean, I'll-I'll probably
visit her every other weekend.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.799
Oh, that will be nice.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.803
My only companion was the mouse
that lived behind the stove.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.239
Of course,

14:09.283 --> 14:11.851
once winter came
and the radiator turned on,

14:11.894 --> 14:13.896
I never saw him again.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.336
These are ready to go.

14:24.037 --> 14:27.475
28. 29.

14:27.518 --> 14:30.652
30. You're
getting stronger.

14:30.695 --> 14:33.960
Before you know it, I'll be
lifting cars off children.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.657
Don't set unachievable goals.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.703
You will only disappoint
yourself and the ones you love.

14:38.747 --> 14:41.184
It was a joke.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.709
It was not very good.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.886
What the heck is wrong with you?

14:46.929 --> 14:48.800
This whole doctor
foolishness.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.541
I'm too old.

14:50.585 --> 14:53.240
And besides, I will never get
into Johns Hopkins.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.981
Say that again
but closer to my good hand

14:55.024 --> 14:57.113
so I can smack you with it.

14:57.157 --> 15:00.290
Either way, the stress of it all
will tear Bob and I apart.

15:00.334 --> 15:03.337
Maybe being a doctor
was not the right path for me.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.340
Of course it's the right path
for you. You'll be great.

15:06.383 --> 15:07.602
How do you know?

15:07.645 --> 15:09.865
Without you,

15:09.909 --> 15:12.563
I could never do...

15:17.568 --> 15:18.874
...this.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.485
Ta-da.

15:21.529 --> 15:22.922
You can stand?

15:22.965 --> 15:25.489
Stick around, honey,
watch me work on my twerk.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.021
Your mother can walk.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.892
- What?
- She also attempted

15:36.936 --> 15:37.980
to twerk.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.808
Which is
surprisingly good exercise

15:39.851 --> 15:41.723
for rehabilitation.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.768
I don't need the specifics.
I just need to know

15:43.812 --> 15:45.770
how long before
she can twerk on out of here.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.642
There is still more
progress to be made,

15:47.685 --> 15:51.037
but apparently she's been able
to walk for weeks.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.301
And you're just finding out
- about this now?
- Yes.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.956
Being out of the loop
isn't fun, is it?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.176
I see what you are doing.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.830
- What?
- Since I left you

16:01.873 --> 16:03.614
out of the loop,
you are drawing a parallel

16:03.658 --> 16:05.007
between me and Dottie.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.487
I don't care
what your mom says.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.967
You <i>are</i> smart.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.448
So, you do not want me
to go to Johns Hopkins?

16:11.492 --> 16:12.972
What I want

16:13.015 --> 16:15.017
is to be part
of the conversation

16:15.061 --> 16:16.888
about our future.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.326
Where would you
want me to go?

16:19.369 --> 16:20.631
Johns Hopkins.

16:20.675 --> 16:23.286
I wouldn't want you to settle
for anything less.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.419
You know I would never
settle for anything less.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.290
I do.

16:28.639 --> 16:31.033
I will retake the MCAT.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.208
Sorry.

16:32.252 --> 16:33.949
We will discuss it.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.690
You're retaking the MCAT.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.474
Good idea.

16:37.518 --> 16:40.477
There is one more thing
we need to talk about.

16:40.521 --> 16:43.350
- Okay.
- We got to get your mother back to Nigeria.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.961
I concur with this plan.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.007
Good discussion.

16:56.798 --> 16:58.669
Oh, that was good, huh?

16:58.713 --> 17:00.280
Hey, top me off,
will you, Bobby?

17:00.323 --> 17:01.542
Bottle's on the counter.

17:01.585 --> 17:04.066
And I'll bet
you can get it yourself.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.372
It is good

17:05.415 --> 17:07.243
for you to start using
those muscles.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.985
I never took you for a snitch.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.468
Look at her go.
Hey!

17:14.511 --> 17:16.600
Good job, Dottie.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.254
We're so proud of you.

17:18.298 --> 17:19.734
All right, stop gawking.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.910
I'm not a show pony.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.085
You know,

17:23.129 --> 17:24.391
during the week,

17:24.434 --> 17:26.393
Tunde and I speed walk
at the mall.

17:26.436 --> 17:27.872
You should join us.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.048
We do a mile,

17:29.091 --> 17:31.963
then reward ourselves
with a Cinnabon.

17:32.007 --> 17:34.270
Abishola will be working

17:34.314 --> 17:37.056
at Cinnabon if she does
not get her scores up.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.406
What kind of wife
makes her mother-in-law

17:39.449 --> 17:41.625
- get her own glass of wine?
- Gauze.

17:41.669 --> 17:42.974
I did not raise you like this.
Gauze.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.280
You know better.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.631
- More beans?
- Yes, please.

17:47.675 --> 17:51.113
Hey, you got any gauze I could
shove in my mom's piehole?

17:52.158 --> 17:53.463
I'm the worst, aren't I?
