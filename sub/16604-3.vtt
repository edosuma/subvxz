WEBVTT

00:00.969 --> 00:02.615
Next time you miss <i>Shameless,</i>

00:02.617 --> 00:05.121
I cut off your testicles and
feed it to homeless dog

00:05.122 --> 00:06.491
who lives behind Alibi.

00:06.492 --> 00:08.695
But today, you get free pass.

00:08.696 --> 00:09.964
I tell you.

00:10.800 --> 00:11.634
Phillip.

00:11.635 --> 00:12.970
Tito, senior intern.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.038
- Nice to meet you.
- All right, follow me.

00:14.039 --> 00:15.141
I'll show you around.

00:15.142 --> 00:16.677
Filling out the paperwork

00:16.678 --> 00:19.917
to disinherit you
abortion-should-have-beens.

00:19.918 --> 00:21.721
We are gonna start a maid service

00:21.722 --> 00:24.092
that is not only topless,
but also cleans.

00:24.093 --> 00:25.429
We'll corner the market.

00:25.430 --> 00:27.433
Your thing is kind of weird.

00:27.434 --> 00:29.102
It has all this extra skin.

00:29.103 --> 00:31.574
Confronted Caleb about that chick.

00:31.575 --> 00:32.776
He's screwing her.

00:32.777 --> 00:33.912
- <i>That's a nice stroller.</i>

00:33.913 --> 00:34.847
<i>Where'd you get it?</i>

00:34.848 --> 00:35.715
I found it in the park.

00:35.716 --> 00:36.551
I'm gonna sell it.

00:36.552 --> 00:38.086
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:38.087 --> 00:39.457
Care to join us, doll face?

00:39.458 --> 00:40.725
Sure.

00:40.726 --> 00:41.594
- <i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

00:41.595 --> 00:42.529
I work at Patsy's.

00:42.530 --> 00:43.531
I'd like to quit.

00:43.532 --> 00:44.733
We should just shut it down.

00:44.734 --> 00:46.737
If I stayed on as manager,

00:46.738 --> 00:47.739
would you keep it open?

00:47.740 --> 00:49.109
Just keep it afloat.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

02:19.958 --> 02:20.959
Shit!

02:20.960 --> 02:22.697
Shit. Shit.

02:22.698 --> 02:24.400
Fuck. Fuck.

02:24.401 --> 02:27.506
You okay, babe? You had a bad dream?

02:27.507 --> 02:29.544
Oh, my God.

02:29.545 --> 02:31.981
Hey, uh, we were just, uh, working out.

02:31.982 --> 02:33.250
Just breaking a sweat.

02:33.251 --> 02:34.921
Sorry, got to get that lock fixed.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.424
Yeah.

02:36.425 --> 02:38.027
Might take a while to
get him back to sleep.

02:38.028 --> 02:41.266
You good to hang, and we
can finish our workout?

02:41.267 --> 02:43.505
No, you know, actually, I
should, uh, I should go.

02:43.506 --> 02:45.274
I got to be at my internship early.

02:45.275 --> 02:46.778
What do you do there?

02:46.779 --> 02:48.347
I work for free for a
bunch of douche bags

02:48.348 --> 02:50.719
whose asses I would've
kicked in high school.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.055
- Sounds fun.
- Yeah.

02:52.056 --> 02:53.391
You know your way out?

02:53.392 --> 02:55.963
Yeah, yeah, I'll figure it out.

02:55.964 --> 02:57.298
Okay. Come on, babe. Let's go.

02:57.299 --> 02:58.703
Lights out. Come on.

03:01.341 --> 03:05.047
No. No, no, no. No. No, no!

03:05.048 --> 03:07.486
You have to love me! That's your job!

03:07.487 --> 03:09.055
Shut up, man!

03:09.056 --> 03:10.926
No, no!

03:10.927 --> 03:12.830
- Shut the fuck up!
- We're sleeping here!

03:12.831 --> 03:15.001
You're dreamin'.

03:16.104 --> 03:18.207
You're cryin' in your sleep.

03:18.208 --> 03:20.413
What you dream about?

03:21.582 --> 03:23.586
Pain. Betrayal.

03:25.255 --> 03:29.262
Fiona and Debbie ripped my
skeleton from my flesh.

03:29.263 --> 03:31.266
Jesus.

03:31.267 --> 03:34.072
Monica was there too.

03:34.073 --> 03:37.079
Sucking my blood through a straw.

03:38.783 --> 03:39.984
And you were there.

03:39.985 --> 03:42.456
- What?
- And your kids.

03:42.457 --> 03:44.927
And you put

03:44.928 --> 03:46.598
whiskey-drenched cotton candy

03:46.599 --> 03:48.436
back where my bones had been.

03:51.107 --> 03:53.111
Who's Monica?

03:54.715 --> 03:56.719
Love of my life.

03:58.188 --> 04:00.759
Bane of my existence.

04:05.135 --> 04:06.804
When you're all strung out...

04:09.110 --> 04:10.545
You do look a bit like her.

04:10.546 --> 04:12.282
Hm.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.003
You taste like her too.

04:25.008 --> 04:27.011
Probably the tooth rot.

04:38.636 --> 04:40.439
Slut.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.175
I know you are, but what am I?

04:53.666 --> 04:54.900
Come on, Harriet.

04:54.901 --> 04:56.904
Sleeping time.

04:56.905 --> 04:59.142
Pfft. Is she still scared of me?

04:59.143 --> 05:00.579
Well, she did watch you

05:00.580 --> 05:02.315
bounce Frank's head down
a flight of stairs.

05:02.316 --> 05:04.820
How do you say "he had
it coming" in Nigerian?

05:04.821 --> 05:06.189
What are you doing up?

05:06.190 --> 05:07.826
Caleb won't stop drunk-texting me.

05:07.827 --> 05:08.962
Begging forgiveness?

05:08.963 --> 05:09.830
Begging, then name-calling,

05:09.831 --> 05:11.667
then begging some more.

05:11.668 --> 05:12.536
Nice sex-hair.

05:12.537 --> 05:14.205
Ah, Tinder rocks.

05:14.206 --> 05:15.876
Free sex, any time I want it.

05:15.877 --> 05:17.980
- No strings attached.
- Yeah, but you're female.

05:17.981 --> 05:19.382
Isn't that always available to you?

05:19.383 --> 05:21.387
Maybe. But Tinder makes it simple.

05:21.388 --> 05:24.693
No confusion. No misguided weddings.

05:24.694 --> 05:26.864
Now I just bone and go

05:26.865 --> 05:29.302
so I can save my energy for
more important things.

05:29.303 --> 05:31.741
- Like what?
- Like my job.

05:31.742 --> 05:33.545
Patsy's Pies?

05:33.546 --> 05:34.880
Sure you want to be directing

05:34.881 --> 05:36.216
all your freed up energy there?

05:36.217 --> 05:37.553
You're one to talk.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.089
You spend all day working for free.

05:39.090 --> 05:40.659
- Has a point.
- But my bullshit internship

05:40.660 --> 05:43.499
is gonna turn into a
non-bullshit career.

05:45.903 --> 05:46.905
What?

05:48.509 --> 05:49.711
It was no offense.

05:51.047 --> 05:52.950
Wow.

05:52.951 --> 05:53.886
Some taken.

05:54.888 --> 05:55.723
Hey.

05:57.393 --> 06:00.164
Kind of harsh.

06:00.165 --> 06:02.402
- Only 'cause it's true.
- Are you sure about that?

06:02.403 --> 06:03.972
Working for free is called slave labor

06:03.973 --> 06:05.308
last time I checked.

06:18.067 --> 06:19.570
- Good morning!

06:19.571 --> 06:20.605
As a reminder,

06:20.606 --> 06:22.041
this shelter is closing

06:22.042 --> 06:23.243
at the end of the week.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.349
The Container Store franchise

06:26.350 --> 06:27.786
has taken over our lease.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.623
"The Container Store"? That's a thing?

06:29.624 --> 06:31.928
- Volunteers are passing out

06:31.929 --> 06:34.900
the addresses of other local shelters.

06:34.901 --> 06:37.606
This says the nearest
one is 60 blocks away.

06:37.607 --> 06:39.410
Are we supposed to just walk?

06:39.411 --> 06:42.716
- Where are we gonna go to?
- Back to Tent City, baby.

06:42.717 --> 06:44.553
I hate Tent City.

06:44.554 --> 06:46.457
That Santa Claus-lookin'
dude is always trying

06:46.458 --> 06:47.993
to make me sit on his lap.

06:47.994 --> 06:50.264
No, we are not going to sleep in tents

06:50.265 --> 06:51.767
like Indians and hikers.

06:51.768 --> 06:53.571
I'll find a place for us to squat.

06:53.572 --> 06:57.178
Someplace clean and dry,
or at least indoors.

06:57.179 --> 06:58.581
I'm the patriarch of this family,

06:58.582 --> 07:00.184
and I will provide.

07:00.185 --> 07:01.622
Patriarch?

07:03.459 --> 07:06.797
My dream last night wasn't just a dream.

07:06.798 --> 07:09.770
Was it a hallucination
from all the drugs?

07:09.771 --> 07:12.576
A message from my highest self.

07:12.577 --> 07:15.715
I was awake all night
thinking about this.

07:15.716 --> 07:19.556
My kids ripped my bones out.

07:19.557 --> 07:21.927
They betrayed me. They gutted me.

07:21.928 --> 07:23.765
But <i>you</i> were there...

07:23.766 --> 07:25.468
You and your kids...

07:25.469 --> 07:28.675
Rebuilding me into the
man I was meant to be.

07:28.676 --> 07:31.012
Are you sure you're not still high?

07:31.013 --> 07:34.620
Monica, I need this.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.024
I need a new family of Gallaghers,

07:37.025 --> 07:40.164
and... you need a man to take charge.

07:40.165 --> 07:42.703
My name ain't Monica.

07:42.704 --> 07:44.205
Did I call you Monica?

07:44.206 --> 07:46.510
- Yeah.
- It's... it's another sign.

07:46.511 --> 07:48.146
Can we come with you?

07:48.147 --> 07:50.250
- Where are <i>your</i> parents?
- Mom's dead.

07:50.251 --> 07:51.787
Dad went out to score last week

07:51.788 --> 07:54.258
and never came back.

07:54.259 --> 07:55.762
Jesus.

07:55.763 --> 07:58.300
Sign number three.

07:58.301 --> 08:01.640
- Wha...?
- God is handing me a do-over.

08:01.641 --> 08:03.845
Uh, uh, New Carl.

08:03.846 --> 08:04.947
New Debbie.

08:04.948 --> 08:06.249
I'm a boy.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.320
Really? You need a haircut, Debs.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.857
Uh, New Ian.

08:09.858 --> 08:10.793
New Lip.

08:12.597 --> 08:15.033
You. Yeah.

08:15.034 --> 08:16.302
You alone?

08:16.303 --> 08:18.273
Yeah.

08:18.274 --> 08:19.877
New Fiona.

08:19.878 --> 08:21.947
Oh, no, I don't do three-ways.

08:21.948 --> 08:23.316
Jesus, New Monica.

08:23.317 --> 08:26.122
She's my new daughter, not a three-way.

08:26.123 --> 08:27.492
I'm...

08:27.493 --> 08:29.295
Although we should discuss
the three-way thing,

08:29.296 --> 08:30.799
because you're really missing out.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.669
But no, that's not what this is about.

08:32.669 --> 08:34.005
What is it?

08:34.006 --> 08:35.408
You need new parents.

08:35.409 --> 08:36.876
I need new kids.

08:36.878 --> 08:38.581
Grateful kids. Loving kids.

08:38.582 --> 08:41.052
Whiskey-drenched cotton candy kids.

08:41.053 --> 08:44.927
Not the fucking ingrates
that I've raised.

08:44.928 --> 08:46.865
Welcome, new Gallaghers.

08:48.034 --> 08:48.968
Come on.

08:48.969 --> 08:50.103
Give Daddy Frank a hug.

08:50.104 --> 08:51.674
Come on.

08:51.675 --> 08:53.376
Come on.

08:53.377 --> 08:55.214
Come on! We...

08:55.215 --> 08:58.353
Yeah, there you go.

08:58.354 --> 08:59.991
Yeah.

09:00.993 --> 09:02.127
Okay.

09:02.128 --> 09:03.464
Come on, buddy. Can't be late.

09:03.465 --> 09:05.300
Day care's for losers.

09:05.301 --> 09:06.337
Thank you, Frank.

09:07.573 --> 09:09.676
Oh, here.

09:09.677 --> 09:11.346
I'm not violent, Joyalisi.

09:11.347 --> 09:12.716
Just in a hurry.

09:12.717 --> 09:15.320
Her name is Jolayemi.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.857
She can call me what she wants.

09:16.858 --> 09:18.828
Oh.

09:18.829 --> 09:20.598
You owe me for the week.

09:20.599 --> 09:22.001
Right.

09:22.002 --> 09:23.538
I'm sorry. I'm a little short.

09:23.539 --> 09:25.107
My Internet business had a slowdown

09:25.108 --> 09:26.677
due to a lack of inventory,

09:26.678 --> 09:28.214
but I'll have it for you tonight.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.528
Okay, thanks. Have a great day.

09:38.134 --> 09:39.235
Luther, what's up?

09:39.236 --> 09:40.738
'Sup?

09:40.739 --> 09:42.274
'Sup is you gave my daughter gonorrhea,

09:42.275 --> 09:43.644
you little shit stain.

09:43.645 --> 09:44.780
- That's what's up.
- I did?

09:44.781 --> 09:45.915
- Run, Carl!

09:51.795 --> 09:52.996
What the hell?

10:01.080 --> 10:02.849
You better run, Gallagher!

10:37.520 --> 10:38.888
What?

10:38.889 --> 10:40.692
Worried about Fiona.

10:40.693 --> 10:43.029
I don't know what to say. I
keep texting and deleting.

10:43.030 --> 10:44.666
- Why worried?
- Haven't heard from her.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.403
Haven't had time to stop by. It's weird.

10:46.404 --> 10:48.239
I have no idea what's
going on in her life.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.976
Well, she's busy fucking strangers.

10:49.977 --> 10:51.480
It's new hobby. Very time-consuming.

10:53.017 --> 10:54.786
Kev is on his way with
the ice cream truck.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.523
Titty van, you mean?

10:56.524 --> 10:58.359
He already has seven bookings.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.698
So what, I watch bar, you
strip, Kev watches babies?

11:00.699 --> 11:02.702
Be more fun to strip together.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.205
So Kev watches babies behind bar?

11:04.206 --> 11:06.008
No, 'cause he wants to drive us around.

11:06.009 --> 11:07.545
Act as a bouncer just in case.

11:07.546 --> 11:08.748
A pimp, you mean.

11:08.749 --> 11:09.883
So who's gonna watch bar?

11:12.355 --> 11:13.892
That's Kev.

11:18.602 --> 11:22.241
Check it out, sister-wives!

11:22.242 --> 11:23.677
We gonna ride around in that?

11:23.678 --> 11:25.848
Right?

11:27.787 --> 11:29.221
Whoo!

11:29.222 --> 11:31.025
You know, my tits are smaller than this.

11:31.026 --> 11:32.429
Our customers won't mind. Hey, pal.

11:33.799 --> 11:36.235
Uh, topless maids that actually clean.

11:36.236 --> 11:37.238
Pass it along.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.743
Where are the kids?

11:39.744 --> 11:40.711
Check it out.

11:40.712 --> 11:41.880
Custom-built.

11:41.881 --> 11:43.384
Are you ready for this?

11:46.223 --> 11:47.124
What do you think?

11:47.125 --> 11:48.193
Is that genius or what?

11:48.194 --> 11:49.361
They love it.

11:49.362 --> 11:50.230
They can't... Look at 'em.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.600
Look at. They love it.

11:51.601 --> 11:53.437
What's that smell?

11:53.438 --> 11:55.608
That's not coming from
the van. Excuse me, sir.

11:55.609 --> 11:57.177
This is a legitimate business here.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.126
- Whoa!
- What the fuck?

12:05.127 --> 12:07.097
No, Lana, Lana!

12:07.098 --> 12:08.132
- Aah!
- Stop!

12:09.403 --> 12:11.372
- Oh!

12:11.373 --> 12:12.475
- No!
- I got... I got...

12:12.476 --> 12:13.544
Shit.

12:20.492 --> 12:22.996
What the fuck is going on here?

12:27.305 --> 12:29.609
This is my father.

12:29.610 --> 12:31.613
He's staying with us for a while.

12:36.624 --> 12:38.427
Guy at table eight sent back his burger

12:38.428 --> 12:39.996
and left without paying.

12:39.997 --> 12:42.168
Said it tastes like
ketchup-flavored cardboard.

12:47.011 --> 12:48.881
Johnny, come on.

12:48.882 --> 12:50.418
You burn any more of these burgers,

12:50.419 --> 12:52.054
I'm gonna deep fry you.

12:52.055 --> 12:54.659
You get me better meat and I
wouldn't have to char it.

12:54.660 --> 12:56.463
That shit you bought
tastes like freezer burn.

12:56.464 --> 12:58.400
Well, I had to cut costs.
Otherwise, we all lose our jobs.

12:58.401 --> 12:59.636
You get what you pay for.

12:59.637 --> 13:00.838
Yeah, well, can't you get creative?

13:00.839 --> 13:02.575
Some new spices or something?

13:02.576 --> 13:04.278
You think you can do
my job better than me?

13:04.279 --> 13:05.448
You're welcome to it.

13:05.449 --> 13:08.286
You pick up that attitude in prison?

13:08.287 --> 13:09.289
Hello?

13:11.494 --> 13:12.830
Liam punched him where?

13:14.165 --> 13:16.370
Okay, did he say that he was sorry?

13:17.973 --> 13:20.143
No, I'll come pick him up.

13:20.144 --> 13:22.381
I got to go pick up my
kid brother at day care.

13:22.382 --> 13:24.820
Try not to poison anyone while I'm gone.

13:35.809 --> 13:38.012
What, are you gonna eat
breakfast off of that floor?

13:38.013 --> 13:39.348
How long have you been here?

13:39.349 --> 13:40.651
Came in early.

13:40.652 --> 13:42.054
Caleb and I broke up.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.158
Need something to fill my time.

13:44.159 --> 13:46.563
Well, the shine's hurting my eyes.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.232
<i>Medic 12.
First and Indian Heights.</i>

13:48.233 --> 13:49.469
<i>Agitated female.</i>

13:49.470 --> 13:50.938
<i>Tried to run into traffic.</i>

13:50.939 --> 13:53.544
<i>Police have her subdued and cuffed.</i>

13:53.545 --> 13:54.679
That's us. Let's hit it.

13:54.680 --> 13:55.881
Coming.

13:58.153 --> 13:59.989
Come on. Let's go.

14:01.961 --> 14:04.131
Yes!

14:06.336 --> 14:07.638
Yo.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.141
Smells like a brewery in here.

14:09.142 --> 14:11.580
Because that is the smell of victory.

14:11.581 --> 14:12.849
Yes!

14:12.850 --> 14:15.588
Yes!

14:15.589 --> 14:16.923
How long's he been playing for?

14:16.924 --> 14:18.994
Uh... about 18 hours.

14:18.995 --> 14:20.029
Jesus.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.365
You guys watch him all night?

14:21.366 --> 14:22.367
I got to piss!

14:22.368 --> 14:23.704
That's you, man.

14:23.705 --> 14:24.939
Yeah?

14:27.713 --> 14:29.716
Hey, so you... you want
me to play for you

14:29.717 --> 14:31.553
while you go to the bathroom?

14:31.554 --> 14:33.390
I'm... I'm not bad, but I
can't make any promises.

14:37.533 --> 14:38.901
What?

14:38.902 --> 14:40.871
Listen, you're not playing for him.

14:40.872 --> 14:42.875
You're changing his piss bag.

14:42.876 --> 14:44.412
His what?

14:44.413 --> 14:46.149
Well, he's wearing an external catheter.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.256
What the fuck is that?

14:50.257 --> 14:52.060
Well, it's a condom attached to his dick

14:52.061 --> 14:55.701
attached to a tube, and
it fills up that bag.

14:55.702 --> 14:56.903
Why?

14:56.904 --> 14:58.407
'Cause that's what champions do.

15:01.213 --> 15:04.219
Look, just change it
before it overflows.

15:06.958 --> 15:08.627
Are... are you fucking with me?

15:08.628 --> 15:09.896
Well, it's either that

15:09.897 --> 15:11.900
or you can pull the
catheter off his dick

15:11.901 --> 15:14.906
and hold the bottle,
and he can piss in it.

15:14.907 --> 15:15.941
You're an intern.

15:15.942 --> 15:17.277
Grunt work is the job,

15:17.278 --> 15:18.714
and I've changed it twice already, so...

15:18.715 --> 15:22.489
I have got to piss!

15:27.966 --> 15:29.067
All right.

15:51.246 --> 15:53.450
Why is he covered in shit, Lana?

15:53.451 --> 15:56.790
He rode into country
hiding on cow freighter.

15:57.793 --> 15:58.994
He can't stay with us.

15:58.995 --> 16:00.664
He's covered in tattoos.

16:00.665 --> 16:02.501
Is that a penis fucking a skull?

16:02.502 --> 16:04.606
Kev, he sold her into sex slavery.

16:06.142 --> 16:08.279
Yeah, he can't stay with us.

16:08.280 --> 16:09.348
Tell her.

16:09.349 --> 16:11.318
- Hey, Svet.
- Yo.

16:11.319 --> 16:13.457
Uh, he can't stay with us.

16:13.458 --> 16:15.326
Yeah, sorry, we discussed it,

16:15.327 --> 16:17.466
and we just don't think
it's a good idea.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.105
So, we live together.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.441
We love together.

16:22.442 --> 16:24.645
We even raise babies together.

16:24.646 --> 16:27.051
But this decision we
do not make together?

16:28.521 --> 16:30.156
- She's right.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.726
We're just worried about him being

16:31.727 --> 16:33.663
in the house with the babies.

16:33.664 --> 16:35.467
Ah, he's good for babies. Sweet.

16:35.468 --> 16:36.970
He is also good behind bar.

16:36.971 --> 16:38.407
He solves bartender problem

16:38.408 --> 16:40.411
while we go out and
do titty van business

16:40.412 --> 16:42.415
so we can save money for
college for babies.

16:42.416 --> 16:43.817
You want us to leave our bar with him?

16:43.818 --> 16:44.886
Does he even speak English?

16:44.887 --> 16:46.656
English does not matter.

16:46.657 --> 16:47.992
Make drink. Take money.

16:47.993 --> 16:50.163
Hurt people who do not pay money.

16:50.164 --> 16:51.766
I grew up in his bar.

16:51.767 --> 16:54.337
Everything I know, I
learn from this man.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.394
- I'll go get him some clothes.
- Don't you dare leave.

17:08.233 --> 17:09.469
Dude, can you just slow down?

17:09.470 --> 17:10.737
Call said "agitated woman."

17:10.738 --> 17:12.173
Agitated is code for mentally ill.

17:12.174 --> 17:13.810
The cops already have her cuffed.

17:13.810 --> 17:15.981
- She can't do any more damage.
- She's suffering.

17:15.982 --> 17:18.185
Well, Jesus, we're not
gonna be able to help her

17:18.185 --> 17:19.387
if you kill us first.

17:19.388 --> 17:20.656
Almost there.

17:25.667 --> 17:26.903
You burst your stitches <i>again?</i>

17:26.904 --> 17:28.707
What the hell did you do to me?

17:28.708 --> 17:30.911
Excuse me, but he has
his finger up my ass.

17:30.912 --> 17:33.015
Take a seat in the waiting room.
I'll be with you in a minute.

17:33.016 --> 17:35.119
- The gonorrhea?
- What?

17:35.120 --> 17:37.123
You gave me gonorrhea!

17:37.124 --> 17:39.695
- Jesus.
- I didn't give him gonorrhea.

17:39.696 --> 17:41.599
I gave him a circumcision.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.403
He's a little old for that, isn't he?

17:43.404 --> 17:44.405
That's what I said!

17:44.406 --> 17:45.641
All right. I've seen TV.

17:45.642 --> 17:46.943
I know how you can get infections

17:46.944 --> 17:48.279
from these surgeries.

17:48.280 --> 17:49.582
Why do you think you have gonorrhea?

17:49.583 --> 17:50.984
You have swollen glands?

17:50.985 --> 17:52.488
A discharge?

17:52.489 --> 17:54.157
No, but my girlfriend has it,

17:54.158 --> 17:56.829
and her dad wants to kill
me, and the dude's a cop!

17:56.830 --> 17:58.098
Okay. First things first.

17:58.099 --> 18:01.574
Let's run a test. Hop up on the table.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.859
That's not the hole it goes in.

18:11.860 --> 18:14.865
Whenever you consider
not using a condom,

18:14.866 --> 18:17.103
remember this pain.

18:17.104 --> 18:19.475
Aah!

18:19.476 --> 18:20.309
Barkeep!

18:20.310 --> 18:22.046
Six bloody marys.

18:22.047 --> 18:23.382
Hold the mary. Here we go.

18:23.383 --> 18:25.286
I hate bloody marys.

18:25.287 --> 18:28.292
Tomato juice prevents scurvy,
and beggars can't be choosers.

18:28.293 --> 18:29.930
Put your stuff over there.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.239
Who's this?

18:35.240 --> 18:37.076
Svetlana's father.

18:37.077 --> 18:38.780
Welcome, comrade.

18:38.781 --> 18:41.184
I'm Frank Gallagher. Me and
my kids drink for free.

18:41.185 --> 18:42.588
Also, we're gonna be staying

18:42.589 --> 18:44.592
in the apartment upstairs for a while.

18:44.593 --> 18:46.829
If Kevin were here,
he'd sign off on that

18:46.830 --> 18:48.365
because he once tried to kill me

18:48.366 --> 18:51.104
and he would like to avoid prison.

18:55.213 --> 18:56.716
Also, assuming you're a communist,

18:56.717 --> 19:00.322
you understand the rich
helping out the poor.

19:04.633 --> 19:08.238
So I'll just need those drinks.

19:08.239 --> 19:09.842
Not for the kids.

19:09.843 --> 19:12.582
No alcohol for the kids.
They drink virgin marys.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.254
And the key,

19:16.255 --> 19:19.863
which Kev keeps in the
register right there.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.136
<i>Sprechen sie English?</i>

19:29.783 --> 19:32.488
Christ on a cracker,
Russians are strong.

19:32.489 --> 19:34.892
- Are you okay, Daddy Frank?
- Course I am.

19:34.893 --> 19:36.896
Ah. My spirit is like a cockroach.

19:36.897 --> 19:38.666
It can't be crushed.

19:38.667 --> 19:40.537
My back's a little
weaker than my spirit.

19:40.538 --> 19:42.006
Come on, kids.

19:42.007 --> 19:44.010
Let's go dumpster diving
behind the donut shop.

19:44.011 --> 19:45.413
- No. No!
- We're hungry.

19:45.414 --> 19:47.083
I said I will provide.

19:47.084 --> 19:49.020
I-I-I will provide.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.891
Help me up.

19:50.892 --> 19:53.195
I know a joint.

19:53.196 --> 19:54.765
Great pancakes. Shitty service.

19:54.766 --> 19:56.334
Cunty manager.

19:56.335 --> 19:58.372
We'll get food there.

20:02.782 --> 20:04.785
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.288
Why aren't you listening to me?

20:06.289 --> 20:07.624
Let me go! Let me go!

20:07.625 --> 20:08.960
He's coming for me!

20:08.961 --> 20:10.797
- I have to go!
- Kaylee Jones.

20:10.798 --> 20:13.068
She ran into traffic. Said
the demon was chasing her.

20:13.069 --> 20:14.939
History of schizophrenia,
but no violent crimes,

20:14.940 --> 20:17.445
so I'd rather not book
her if I can avoid it.

20:18.581 --> 20:20.249
All right, Kaylee. Kaylee.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.752
I'm Ian. Where's the demon now?

20:21.753 --> 20:22.888
He's coming! Please!

20:22.889 --> 20:24.224
Then we better keep you safe.

20:24.225 --> 20:25.493
I can do that,

20:25.494 --> 20:27.063
but you have to trust me, Kaylee.

20:27.064 --> 20:28.399
- Can you do that?
- He's coming!

20:28.400 --> 20:30.135
I know.

20:30.136 --> 20:32.642
Demons have been after me before too.

20:36.115 --> 20:37.484
All right.

20:37.485 --> 20:38.987
You just have to get to the ambulance,

20:38.988 --> 20:40.824
and then you're safe, all right, Kaylee?

20:40.825 --> 20:42.360
All right, you can do that, right?

20:42.361 --> 20:44.298
- Mm-hmm.
- Good, let's go.

20:46.135 --> 20:48.439
It's okay.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.274
It's all right.

20:49.275 --> 20:50.310
I'm here.

20:57.425 --> 20:59.628
OMG, your bag is to die.

20:59.629 --> 21:00.964
Oh, thank you.

21:00.965 --> 21:02.434
It's a limited edition.

21:02.435 --> 21:03.636
Oh, clearly.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.440
Is there anything I can help you with?

21:05.441 --> 21:09.113
Um... well, Harry's only six months old,

21:09.114 --> 21:11.919
but she's already wearing
clothes for 18 months.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.190
Do you have this cashmere
sweater in a larger size?

21:14.191 --> 21:17.129
I think I do in the back.
Love her name, by the way.

21:17.130 --> 21:18.031
It's so retro.

21:18.032 --> 21:18.968
Thank you.

21:38.006 --> 21:40.410
I just want to know
how long he's gonna stay.

21:40.411 --> 21:42.848
He kept roof over my head
and borsch in my bowl

21:42.849 --> 21:45.252
until I was ten years old,
ready to work on corner.

21:45.253 --> 21:46.522
For this, I owe him.

21:46.523 --> 21:48.325
I also owe him the money he spent

21:48.326 --> 21:49.661
to smuggle me into country.

21:49.662 --> 21:51.465
You owe him the money he paid smugglers

21:51.466 --> 21:53.469
so you could be a sex slave in America?

21:53.470 --> 21:56.041
This is land of free, home of brave.

21:56.042 --> 21:58.980
And if he had not smuggled
me, I would not have met you

21:58.981 --> 22:00.884
and become happy wedded thrupple bliss.

22:00.885 --> 22:02.454
- She's got a point.
- Shut up, Kev!

22:02.455 --> 22:04.223
I'm just saying, if I had a dad,

22:04.224 --> 22:05.560
I would forgive a lot too.

22:05.561 --> 22:07.697
- You know what...
- Enough!

22:07.698 --> 22:08.633
We strip now.

22:08.634 --> 22:10.404
Pimp, watch babies.

22:19.722 --> 22:20.990
Hi.

22:20.991 --> 22:23.830
Uh, sorry, but, uh...

22:23.831 --> 22:25.199
can you move your van?

22:25.200 --> 22:27.002
I live right over there,

22:27.003 --> 22:28.573
and I have some little kids

22:28.574 --> 22:30.175
who are about to come out
and play in the yard.

22:30.176 --> 22:31.745
And?

22:31.746 --> 22:35.753
And, uh, your van is very graphic.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.089
It's pornographic, really.

22:37.090 --> 22:39.227
Oh, thank you. Those are my wives.

22:39.228 --> 22:40.763
- Well, lucky you.
- Mm-hmm.

22:40.764 --> 22:43.769
Uh, my wife... I just have the one...

22:43.770 --> 22:45.205
Highly emotional woman.

22:45.206 --> 22:47.143
And if my five and seven-year-old sons

22:47.144 --> 22:49.213
are exposed to pornography
for the first time

22:49.214 --> 22:51.184
while playing in our yard...

22:51.185 --> 22:53.321
She's just likely to cry
until I agree to move

22:53.322 --> 22:54.992
to an even more expensive neighborhood.

22:54.993 --> 22:56.361
Look, man, you tell your wife

22:56.362 --> 22:57.564
this is a legitimate business,

22:57.565 --> 22:59.000
and under the 14th amendment,

22:59.001 --> 23:01.405
we have every right
to exercise our right

23:01.406 --> 23:03.208
to free speech and show boobs.

23:03.209 --> 23:06.214
The 14th amendment abolished slavery.

23:06.215 --> 23:07.851
God damn right it did.

23:07.852 --> 23:09.855
Good thing too, because
one of my wives is black,

23:09.856 --> 23:11.291
and the other one was a slave.

23:11.292 --> 23:12.761
Dude, what the hell are
you talking about?

23:12.762 --> 23:13.763
Oh, good, thanks a lot.

23:13.764 --> 23:15.065
Now you woke up my kids.

23:15.066 --> 23:17.804
- Look, all right?
- Shh, shh, shh.

23:17.805 --> 23:19.140
Please.

23:19.141 --> 23:20.610
I'm begging you.

23:20.611 --> 23:23.216
Father to father. Husband to husband.

23:25.220 --> 23:26.623
Oh, man.

23:29.562 --> 23:32.166
I'll pull the van around the block.

23:32.167 --> 23:33.403
Hey, you, uh...

23:34.806 --> 23:37.410
Want a business card,
just in case, uh...

23:37.411 --> 23:39.816
your wife goes out of town or something?

23:50.771 --> 23:52.941
Please, I can't breathe.

23:52.942 --> 23:54.945
I will not let the demon
near you, Kaylee.

23:54.946 --> 23:56.247
I promise.

23:56.248 --> 23:58.452
I can't move. Please undo them.

23:58.453 --> 24:01.090
I'm not supposed to do that.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.429
Please. Please. They're hurting me.

24:03.430 --> 24:05.566
It's gonna be okay. All right?

24:05.567 --> 24:08.004
You're okay.

24:08.005 --> 24:10.176
It hurts.

24:13.282 --> 24:14.351
Ian!

24:16.456 --> 24:19.628
- She's gonna be okay.
- It is not protocol.

24:19.629 --> 24:20.630
Please help me.

24:20.631 --> 24:22.701
Take a deep breath, Kaylee.

24:22.702 --> 24:23.637
All right?

24:25.373 --> 24:28.044
- I'm gonna open them.
- No, God damn it, Gallagher!

24:28.045 --> 24:29.347
She's fine, Sue!

24:29.348 --> 24:30.683
- Watch the road, all right?
- No...

24:30.684 --> 24:32.019
She's fine. You're all right, right?

24:32.020 --> 24:34.290
- Oh, yes, yes.
- All right.

24:34.291 --> 24:35.560
Yeah, look. You're okay.

24:35.561 --> 24:36.628
- Thank you.
- Okay.

24:36.629 --> 24:37.630
Ian!

24:37.631 --> 24:38.699
See? She's fine.

24:38.700 --> 24:39.868
Jesus...

24:39.869 --> 24:41.070
Kaylee!

24:44.545 --> 24:45.881
Oh, my God.

24:50.524 --> 24:53.194
When is the last time someone
ordered liver and onions?

24:53.195 --> 24:54.598
Just that old dude.

24:54.599 --> 24:56.334
Comes in Tuesdays for the early bird.

24:56.335 --> 24:58.271
Sorry, old dude.

24:58.272 --> 25:00.877
So you can spend money on this
camel toe I'm forced to wear,

25:00.878 --> 25:02.881
but the liver and onions
is just too much?

25:02.882 --> 25:03.949
Uniforms bring in business.

25:03.950 --> 25:05.318
Liver and onions don't.

25:07.892 --> 25:10.295
- Table for seven, please.
- No, I'm sorry, I don't...

25:10.296 --> 25:11.799
- Out!
- There's a booth open.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.636
- Come on, kids.
- Out.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.873
- Come on, kids... I got it.
- Dad! Mommy!

25:15.874 --> 25:17.477
- Hey!
- Aww!

25:17.478 --> 25:18.979
She's not your mother, Liam.

25:18.980 --> 25:20.516
Water is thicker than blood these days.

25:20.517 --> 25:22.587
Yeah, and thanks to
your influence, Frank,

25:22.588 --> 25:24.591
Liam is no longer welcome at day care.

25:24.592 --> 25:27.362
He punched a kid in the balls
and called him a gringo.

25:27.363 --> 25:28.699
Okay, son. Glad to hear it.

25:28.700 --> 25:30.101
Give 'em hell.

25:30.102 --> 25:31.939
- What's your name?
- It's...

25:31.940 --> 25:33.374
Uh, this is New Carl.

25:33.375 --> 25:35.947
And that's New Ian and New Lip,

25:35.948 --> 25:38.452
and this cute one right
here is New Debbie.

25:38.453 --> 25:39.855
Can't I be New Dan?

25:39.856 --> 25:40.857
There's no Dan.

25:40.858 --> 25:42.259
I'm hungry.

25:42.260 --> 25:44.096
I'm sorry, but you can't eat here

25:44.097 --> 25:45.933
unless somebody shows me some money.

25:45.934 --> 25:47.035
How about this?

25:47.036 --> 25:48.706
Oh. Perfect.

25:48.707 --> 25:51.545
Mrs. Wilson.

25:51.546 --> 25:53.816
Let me just take care of that for you.

25:53.817 --> 25:55.318
- Oh!
- Ah, come on.

25:55.319 --> 25:57.524
You're a heartless
little twat, aren't you?

25:57.525 --> 25:59.594
Almost positive I'm not.

25:59.595 --> 26:00.997
I got money.

26:00.998 --> 26:03.268
Took it all from teacher's purse.

26:03.269 --> 26:04.270
You what?

26:04.271 --> 26:06.173
Just like I taught you!

26:06.174 --> 26:08.111
Okay, can we get some food for my...

26:08.112 --> 26:09.514
- No, Frank.
- Hungry...

26:09.515 --> 26:11.017
- You all stink.
- Formerly homeless...

26:11.018 --> 26:13.087
And six bucks won't even cover coffee.

26:13.088 --> 26:14.424
Okay, kids.

26:14.425 --> 26:16.027
As we discussed. One, two, three, go.

26:17.932 --> 26:19.601
- We're starving!
- She's gonna throw up.

26:19.602 --> 26:20.736
Where's the bathroom?

26:20.737 --> 26:22.105
We've been doing drugs.

26:22.106 --> 26:24.243
She's sick. So go throw up.

26:24.244 --> 26:25.378
Um, okay.

26:25.379 --> 26:28.752
Fine. Fine. Just shut up!

26:28.753 --> 26:31.558
- There we go.
- No, none for the adults.

26:31.559 --> 26:34.397
- Bitch.
- You tell her, New Fiona.

26:34.398 --> 26:35.299
That's New Fiona?

26:37.103 --> 26:38.906
- If the bra fits...
- Okay.

26:38.907 --> 26:41.310
Out, or I swear to God,
I'm gonna call the cops.

26:41.311 --> 26:42.814
You wouldn't.

26:42.815 --> 26:45.653
- Here I go.
- Wait.

26:45.654 --> 26:48.358
- You'd call the cops?
- Uh-huh.

26:48.359 --> 26:49.928
What kind of a Gallagher are you?

26:49.929 --> 26:51.263
I'm not a Gallagher.

26:51.264 --> 26:54.303
You disowned me, remember?

26:54.304 --> 26:56.575
You just keep ripping my
bones out, don't you?

26:56.576 --> 26:58.445
Out.

26:58.446 --> 27:00.048
Come on, kids.

27:00.049 --> 27:01.618
Leave it.

27:04.825 --> 27:06.294
Hello?

27:08.400 --> 27:10.771
Ian what? Where?

27:13.342 --> 27:15.012
Oh, shit.

27:16.849 --> 27:18.452
Yeah.

27:18.453 --> 27:19.655
Yeah, I'll be there.

27:21.793 --> 27:23.294
Sierra. I got a situation.

27:23.295 --> 27:24.831
Can I borrow your car?

27:24.832 --> 27:27.035
- Yeah.
- I'm leaving you in charge.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.472
Text me if there's a problem,

27:28.473 --> 27:30.008
and I'll talk you through it, okay?

27:30.009 --> 27:33.015
Uh, are the asses in the
window gonna be a problem?

27:34.150 --> 27:35.953
Oh, Jesus.

27:37.991 --> 27:39.828
Cops are on their way, Frank.

27:39.829 --> 27:42.700
Guess I'll be adding public
nudity to my complaint.

27:42.701 --> 27:44.336
Traitor!

27:44.337 --> 27:47.309
Who do I got to blow to
get a meal around here?

27:47.310 --> 27:49.647
You don't need to blow anyone.

27:49.648 --> 27:50.816
Listen...

27:52.588 --> 27:54.524
Ask...

27:54.525 --> 27:55.926
and Daddy Frank will provide.

27:55.927 --> 27:57.262
- Follow me.
- Where?

27:58.633 --> 28:01.605
To the best free chocolate chip cookie

28:01.606 --> 28:02.974
in the Upper Midwest.

28:02.975 --> 28:04.309
Come on.

28:06.516 --> 28:08.017
In Russia, family is family.

28:08.018 --> 28:09.386
We aren't used to parents

28:09.387 --> 28:10.890
seeing their children as sex objects.

28:10.891 --> 28:12.894
Oh, your husband fucked
your mother to make babies.

28:12.895 --> 28:14.464
You want to ride on high horse?

28:14.465 --> 28:15.733
I have two daughters.

28:15.734 --> 28:17.002
You don't see how that might worry me?

28:17.003 --> 28:18.405
He will not be interested in baby girls

28:18.406 --> 28:20.041
until they reach at least ten years old.

28:20.042 --> 28:21.377
You don't see how that's disturbing?

28:21.378 --> 28:23.014
- Oh!
- Put your boobs away fast.

28:23.015 --> 28:23.849
Babies are in the truck.

28:23.850 --> 28:25.553
We're not done.

28:25.554 --> 28:27.155
No, I know, but it turns out
we can make way more money

28:27.156 --> 28:29.092
by driving the truck around
and just parking it.

28:29.093 --> 28:30.028
Come on.

28:30.029 --> 28:31.197
Oh, sir, no, uh, charge

28:31.198 --> 28:32.600
for lack of completion.

28:48.365 --> 28:50.502
Help yourself to a cookie
and have a look around.

28:50.503 --> 28:51.972
Take all the time you need.

28:51.973 --> 28:53.374
I'm here to answer any
questions you may have.

28:53.375 --> 28:54.711
Hey, kids, you heard her!

28:54.712 --> 28:56.146
- Help yourselves!
- Frank Gallagher.

28:56.147 --> 28:58.017
You working with a realtor this time,

28:58.018 --> 28:59.487
or you just here for the baked goods?

28:59.488 --> 29:01.223
No, I'm my own salesman,

29:01.224 --> 29:03.160
so no need of a real estate agent,

29:03.161 --> 29:05.399
but thanks for asking, Sylvie.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.570
She's a shark, this one.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.172
I hope you know how to negotiate.

29:10.877 --> 29:12.513
Mmm, too bad you're
not as good a realtor

29:12.514 --> 29:13.849
as you are a baker.

29:13.850 --> 29:16.053
You've got your cookies.
On your way now.

29:16.054 --> 29:17.857
Let me just show you
the master bathroom.

29:17.858 --> 29:19.259
Oh, oh, oh.

29:19.260 --> 29:21.297
Make sure you show them
where Mrs. Kevitz died.

29:21.298 --> 29:23.134
How long was it before they found her?

29:23.135 --> 29:23.969
A week? Two? Oh.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.406
It was months ago.

29:25.407 --> 29:27.643
She died of old age,
peacefully, at home, in bed.

29:27.644 --> 29:29.447
It's what we all wish for, isn't it?

29:29.448 --> 29:31.818
It's... it's hard to believe
that you got the smell out.

29:31.819 --> 29:33.789
It must've been a lot of air freshener.

29:33.790 --> 29:35.058
Her nephew lives overseas.

29:35.059 --> 29:36.661
Very motivated to sell.

29:36.662 --> 29:37.897
So, the master bathroom.

29:37.898 --> 29:39.132
It needs a little work,

29:39.133 --> 29:41.972
but there's lots of potential there.

29:41.973 --> 29:43.810
- Nice to meet you two.
- Mm-hmm.

29:46.415 --> 29:49.119
Is this gonna be our new
house, Daddy Frank?

29:49.120 --> 29:50.690
Ha-ha.

29:52.326 --> 29:55.131
You know, New Debbie,
that's not a bad idea.

29:56.869 --> 29:58.705
- I get the biggest bedroom!
- Dibs on the shower!

29:58.706 --> 30:00.542
What? Hey.

30:03.215 --> 30:05.519
What do you think, Moni?

30:05.520 --> 30:08.525
Home sweet homeless shelter.

30:08.526 --> 30:10.295
Yeah?

30:13.870 --> 30:15.472
Fuck me, I need a break.

30:15.473 --> 30:16.841
Only break for you

30:16.842 --> 30:19.079
is the record you're
about to break, brah!

30:19.080 --> 30:21.852
Whoo!

30:25.560 --> 30:27.563
Hey, uh, let's replenish
his food, all right?

30:27.564 --> 30:29.367
Yeah, you know where the kitchen is.

30:32.173 --> 30:34.009
Hey.

30:34.010 --> 30:35.579
Hey, what's the hell, man?

30:35.580 --> 30:37.082
I'm not a fuckin' slave.

30:37.083 --> 30:38.885
Okay, I'm supposed to
be learning something.

30:38.886 --> 30:41.391
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

30:41.392 --> 30:42.225
All right, listen.

30:42.226 --> 30:43.895
I have a Rhodes scholar,

30:43.896 --> 30:45.899
an MIT valedictorian,

30:45.900 --> 30:47.436
and a chick with a great ass

30:47.437 --> 30:49.039
and a master's degree
from Carnegie Mellon

30:49.040 --> 30:51.878
who all want this internship.

30:51.879 --> 30:53.482
The only reason you're here

30:53.483 --> 30:55.686
is because Youens let me take
my particle physics final

30:55.687 --> 30:57.923
after I slept through it the first time.

30:57.924 --> 31:01.330
Now, your attitude sucks.

31:01.331 --> 31:04.202
And I am this close to using
whatever little power I have

31:04.203 --> 31:07.375
in this position to get rid of you.

31:07.376 --> 31:09.280
Do you want that?

31:11.752 --> 31:13.188
Just think about it.

31:26.314 --> 31:28.452
Hey! Shoes off the bed!

31:29.588 --> 31:30.490
Get dressed!

31:32.059 --> 31:34.997
You've had your fun,
Frank. Now, get out!

31:34.998 --> 31:37.937
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
be the one to leave, Sylvie.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.339
I got a lease.

31:39.340 --> 31:41.578
I went behind your back
and contacted the owner.

31:41.579 --> 31:43.682
No, you most certainly did not.

31:43.683 --> 31:45.819
- Prove it.
- You prove it.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.357
One year with an option to buy.

31:48.358 --> 31:49.927
You can't smoke in here.

31:49.928 --> 31:52.066
Oh, come on.

31:53.068 --> 31:54.437
Hey, kids!

31:54.438 --> 31:57.410
I need you to show Miss Sylvie the door.

31:58.412 --> 31:59.614
You sick bastard.

31:59.615 --> 32:01.718
Using these kids for your own selfish...

32:01.719 --> 32:02.720
Ow!

32:04.758 --> 32:07.563
I'll be back! With the police!

32:07.564 --> 32:09.099
You stay here with the kids.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.003
Don't leave, no matter what.

32:11.004 --> 32:12.439
- Don't leave.
- Okay, okay, okay.

32:12.440 --> 32:13.508
I'll be back.

32:13.509 --> 32:15.144
Where you going, Daddy Frank?

32:15.145 --> 32:18.183
There's power in numbers, new
and improved Gallaghers.

32:18.184 --> 32:20.187
Lock the door behind me.

32:20.188 --> 32:23.628
Use force to hold our
position, if necessary.

32:23.629 --> 32:24.865
Mm.

32:25.867 --> 32:28.538
Please. Please.

32:28.539 --> 32:29.608
One, two...

32:31.277 --> 32:33.448
I'm sorry. It was a judgment call.

32:33.449 --> 32:37.355
You took the restraints off
a schizophrenic en route?

32:37.356 --> 32:39.059
You are lucky she isn't dead.

32:39.060 --> 32:40.395
It was a mistake.

32:40.396 --> 32:41.497
I won't make it again.

32:41.498 --> 32:44.035
You sure as shit won't.

32:44.036 --> 32:47.409
I'm gonna cover for your ass this time.

32:47.410 --> 32:50.314
- But I need you to watch this.
- Rita, I'm taking my meds.

32:50.315 --> 32:52.486
You want to keep your job, Gallagher?

32:52.487 --> 32:55.157
Shut up and watch this.

32:58.164 --> 33:00.502
<i>Ian, if Rita's
telling you to go home,</i>

33:00.503 --> 33:02.473
<i>you need to listen.</i>

33:02.474 --> 33:04.977
<i>Even if it seems unfair. Even
if you're feeling great.</i>

33:04.978 --> 33:07.181
<i>You made a promise to
Rita that no matter what,</i>

33:07.182 --> 33:08.718
<i>if she thinks you're off your game,</i>

33:08.719 --> 33:10.489
<i>you're gonna go home, so go.</i>

33:10.490 --> 33:12.158
<i>Right now. Don't fight her.</i>

33:12.159 --> 33:13.828
<i>I'm serious. Just go.</i>

33:13.829 --> 33:16.233
<i>All right? Go!</i>

33:16.234 --> 33:19.239
Come on, Ian. I'll drive you home.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.742
What are you doing here?

33:20.743 --> 33:21.978
She's your emergency contact.

33:21.979 --> 33:23.347
Well, I'm not having an emergency!

33:23.348 --> 33:24.417
I disagree.

33:24.418 --> 33:27.188
Rita, I'm not manic, okay?

33:27.189 --> 33:30.327
You drove way too fast on the way.

33:30.328 --> 33:32.265
You scrubbed the rig
three hours before work.

33:32.266 --> 33:34.370
Woody had just cleaned it last night.

33:36.875 --> 33:40.181
You were making breakfast in
the middle of the night, Ian.

33:40.182 --> 33:41.684
Your meds can go out of balance

33:41.685 --> 33:43.086
when you go through a high-stress thing

33:43.087 --> 33:44.790
like a break-up.

33:44.791 --> 33:47.797
Just take the week off
and... And go to a doctor.

33:55.413 --> 33:56.748
- Okay.
- Good.

34:08.606 --> 34:10.174
Do you need any other sizes?

34:10.175 --> 34:13.447
Um, yeah, I'd love to see the, um, jeans

34:13.449 --> 34:15.719
and, uh, pink sweater in
the next size up, please.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.288
Still working on losing the baby weight.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.460
Oh, I know. It's just the worst.

34:19.460 --> 34:21.062
Take your time. I'll be right back.

34:21.063 --> 34:22.063
Thank you.

34:34.123 --> 34:35.725
Been texting you.

34:35.726 --> 34:37.396
Jeez, Carl. You scared me.

34:37.397 --> 34:39.632
Yeah, well, your pops tried
to kill me this morning.

34:39.634 --> 34:41.168
Yeah? Probably best to avoid him.

34:41.170 --> 34:43.072
I'm so sorry.

34:43.074 --> 34:45.077
I don't know how I possibly
could've gotten gonorrhea.

34:45.078 --> 34:46.813
You better get out of here.

34:46.815 --> 34:48.585
- My dad'll be home soon.
- Wait, so that's it?

34:48.585 --> 34:50.522
You're just gonna ride off
on the bike I bought you?

34:50.523 --> 34:52.527
I cut the tip of my dick off for you.

34:55.231 --> 34:57.235
Dom! I love you!

35:07.890 --> 35:09.059
Yeah?

35:17.677 --> 35:21.450
Hey, your little pixie tribe's
in there trashing the place.

35:21.451 --> 35:24.022
Total shit show.

35:24.023 --> 35:25.458
Ma'am, I understand.

35:25.459 --> 35:26.460
I'm gonna get you your right order.

35:26.461 --> 35:27.462
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

35:27.463 --> 35:28.765
What... what's going on?

35:28.766 --> 35:29.967
- I...
- This has mold in it.

35:29.968 --> 35:31.837
- Ow!

35:31.838 --> 35:33.006
Okay, stop.

35:33.007 --> 35:34.510
- Burn.
- Stop, stop, stop.

35:34.511 --> 35:35.712
- What's happening?
- Johnny walked out.

35:35.713 --> 35:37.014
We couldn't reach you,

35:37.015 --> 35:38.551
and we tried calling that guy Chad,

35:38.552 --> 35:40.154
but he doesn't pick up his phone.

35:40.155 --> 35:41.156
Okay, oh, fuck. Okay, go...
go back to the floor,

35:41.157 --> 35:42.559
and I'll handle this.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.295
Uh, offer free drinks, and tell everyone

35:44.296 --> 35:45.865
we're just doing the
cold menu right now.

35:45.866 --> 35:47.334
Salads and sandwiches.

35:47.335 --> 35:48.639
Salads and sandwiches.

35:49.574 --> 35:50.809
What's going on?

35:50.810 --> 35:53.180
Uh, I had a... Uh, the cook quit

35:53.181 --> 35:55.184
in the middle of the lunch
rush, but I'm handling it.

35:55.185 --> 35:56.620
Adam, hi.

35:56.621 --> 35:58.458
Uh, I need you to come in right now.

35:58.459 --> 36:00.194
I'm saying pretty please.

36:00.195 --> 36:01.631
Okay, thanks.

36:05.205 --> 36:06.507
Chad, you want to help?

36:06.508 --> 36:08.678
Grab an apron. Start making a BLT.

36:08.679 --> 36:12.620
Otherwise, get out of my way,
and you can yell at me later.

36:33.094 --> 36:34.429
You're leaving?

36:34.430 --> 36:36.266
Uh, yeah. Sorry, nothing fit.

36:36.267 --> 36:37.101
Bummer.

36:37.102 --> 36:38.270
Well, could I tempt you

36:38.271 --> 36:39.840
with this new white-gold baby cuff?

36:39.841 --> 36:41.176
Just got it in this weekend.

36:41.177 --> 36:42.278
Cute, uh, maybe next week...

36:42.279 --> 36:43.614
Could you have taken any longer?

36:43.615 --> 36:44.550
That's her. She's stealing.

36:44.551 --> 36:45.919
What?

36:45.920 --> 36:47.221
I'm not stupid like your baby's name.

36:48.792 --> 36:49.793
I'm saying if you're
in over your head...

36:49.794 --> 36:51.630
I'm not.

36:51.631 --> 36:53.634
You can't leave the diner
unattended during busy hours.

36:53.635 --> 36:54.503
I understand.

36:54.504 --> 36:55.638
Look, I need assurance

36:55.639 --> 36:57.174
that this will never happen again.

36:57.175 --> 36:59.045
Look, I have to take
shit every day, all day,

36:59.046 --> 37:01.483
from a high-school dropout
who could buy and sell me,

37:01.484 --> 37:02.886
'cause that's my job.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.890
I don't have time to also do yours.

37:04.891 --> 37:06.660
Margo's a high-school dropout?

37:06.661 --> 37:08.898
That is so not my point.

37:08.899 --> 37:10.835
Sorry that I wasted your time.

37:10.836 --> 37:12.439
It won't happen again.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.742
Do better.

37:28.805 --> 37:29.974
Hello?

37:31.711 --> 37:33.948
You have got to be kidding me.

37:33.949 --> 37:34.983
No.

37:34.984 --> 37:36.988
No, I-I cannot come right now.

37:38.124 --> 37:40.596
No, no, don't call the police.

37:43.902 --> 37:45.906
Uh, yes, I'll be right there.

37:52.085 --> 37:54.089
The Container Store!

37:55.759 --> 37:57.696
They're closing this
shelter, shutting it down,

37:57.697 --> 37:59.298
not even bothering to replace it,

37:59.299 --> 38:03.641
so they can bring in a...
The Container Store!

38:03.642 --> 38:07.081
A whole building that used
to house human beings

38:07.082 --> 38:09.285
will now be dedicated to
selling things to people

38:09.286 --> 38:11.055
who own so much stuff,

38:11.056 --> 38:13.259
they can't contain it themselves,

38:13.260 --> 38:15.598
so they need the help of a store.

38:15.599 --> 38:17.902
Well, I, for one,

38:17.903 --> 38:19.171
am not waiting for them to

38:19.172 --> 38:21.175
close this shelter at
the end of the week,

38:21.176 --> 38:24.649
and I am not wandering
on foot for 20 miles

38:24.650 --> 38:26.987
to find my way to another shit hole

38:26.988 --> 38:29.826
that they'll close next
week to open a box store

38:29.827 --> 38:32.532
or um... a paper store,

38:32.533 --> 38:35.638
a bag store, or a goddamn pet store!

38:36.941 --> 38:38.711
Because animals are more important

38:38.712 --> 38:42.552
in this country than
homeless human beings!

38:42.553 --> 38:46.894
Well, I'm not waiting,
and I'm not wandering.

38:46.895 --> 38:49.533
I have found a new place to lay my head.

38:49.534 --> 38:52.337
It's warm, it's dry, and it's local,

38:52.338 --> 38:56.513
and I invite you all to
join me there right now!

38:56.514 --> 38:58.784
Right now!

38:58.785 --> 39:00.120
Right now!

39:00.121 --> 39:01.457
Let's go. Right now.

39:01.458 --> 39:03.494
Yes!

39:03.495 --> 39:07.267
But first, everybody grab a cot.

39:19.059 --> 39:20.529
I'm here.

39:22.298 --> 39:23.868
She's sorry.

39:23.869 --> 39:24.970
Let's go, Debs.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.339
Uh, not so fast.

39:26.340 --> 39:27.909
She was shoplifting,

39:27.910 --> 39:29.713
so unless you're able
to pay for everything

39:29.714 --> 39:31.082
that she was taking, then I...

39:31.083 --> 39:34.589
- How much?
- $2,423.82.

39:34.590 --> 39:37.261
- In baby clothes?
- And mommy clothes.

39:37.262 --> 39:39.499
And if you're not gonna pay,
I'm calling the police.

39:39.500 --> 39:40.702
Don't call the police.

39:43.675 --> 39:45.845
She... she wasn't shoplifting.

39:45.846 --> 39:47.882
She just forgot to pay.

39:47.883 --> 39:49.452
She... she does that sometimes.

39:49.453 --> 39:50.756
She forgets things.

39:52.393 --> 39:54.462
It's a symptom of her low IQ.

39:54.463 --> 39:55.899
Fiona!

39:57.035 --> 39:58.638
She's retarded?

40:00.274 --> 40:02.545
That's a... that's a
deeply offensive word.

40:02.546 --> 40:04.950
That's right, Debs. You tell her.

40:04.951 --> 40:06.453
Sorry again for the trouble.

40:06.454 --> 40:07.790
We're leaving.

40:24.657 --> 40:27.194
- You okay, man?
- Yeah, fine.

40:27.195 --> 40:28.797
It's just, you opened that same cabinet,

40:28.798 --> 40:29.633
like, three times.

40:29.634 --> 40:31.102
I'm thirsty.

40:31.103 --> 40:32.940
So you just try the
fridge. Second shelf.

40:45.999 --> 40:47.334
So what happened at work today?

40:47.335 --> 40:49.673
They sent me home.

40:49.674 --> 40:51.242
I'm fine, you know,

40:51.243 --> 40:53.246
but 'cause I have a history
of mental illness,

40:53.247 --> 40:54.783
they send me home when
I make one mistake.

40:54.784 --> 40:56.653
Okay. I get it.

40:56.654 --> 40:58.156
No, you don't.

40:58.157 --> 41:00.661
What, I don't get how
shitty Gallagher genes are?

41:00.662 --> 41:01.997
I have to set a timer

41:01.998 --> 41:03.801
every time I want to have a beer.

41:03.802 --> 41:05.805
Frank's genes might not be quite
as bad as Monica's, but...

41:05.806 --> 41:07.040
But they suck.

41:07.041 --> 41:08.343
Yeah.

41:08.344 --> 41:10.782
Yeah, man. They fucking do.

41:14.623 --> 41:16.827
I haven't slept in a couple nights,

41:16.828 --> 41:20.300
and it's not 'cause
Caleb's been texting.

41:20.301 --> 41:21.636
I don't feel manic,

41:21.637 --> 41:23.574
but I never feel it when I'm manic.

41:23.575 --> 41:26.713
I just feel fine or great

41:26.714 --> 41:27.882
until obviously I'm not

41:27.883 --> 41:29.720
'cause I did something crazy.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.933
When you feel like your meds
might be, like, out of balance,

41:36.934 --> 41:38.269
what are you supposed to do?

41:38.270 --> 41:40.073
Up my downers. Sleep it off.

41:40.074 --> 41:42.110
See the shrink as soon as possible.

41:42.111 --> 41:43.748
All right, then, you do that.

41:46.621 --> 41:48.558
I don't want to.

41:53.468 --> 41:55.070
Yeah, I know.

41:57.074 --> 41:59.311
You know, I didn't want
to go to fucking rehab,

41:59.312 --> 42:00.515
but I did it.

42:03.353 --> 42:05.991
You know, and if I was
gonna bare my soul to you,

42:05.992 --> 42:09.433
which I'm not, but if I was...

42:11.102 --> 42:13.907
You know, I might admit that I wish

42:13.908 --> 42:15.912
I had done it a lot sooner.

42:17.850 --> 42:19.953
You know, like, uh,

42:19.954 --> 42:23.259
before I got kicked out of college

42:23.260 --> 42:25.799
and ruined my whole fucking future.

42:41.797 --> 42:42.899
Yeah.

42:44.102 --> 42:45.404
How do you say sorry to a girl you gave

42:45.405 --> 42:46.773
a disease that could kill her?

42:46.774 --> 42:48.977
- Flowers?
- You... you gave a girl what?

42:48.978 --> 42:50.179
Gonorrhea.

42:50.180 --> 42:52.350
Ah, shit. You get antibiotics?

42:52.351 --> 42:55.057
No, I tested negative,
so I don't need 'em.

42:57.228 --> 42:59.231
O-okay, but Dom, she tested positive?

42:59.232 --> 43:00.635
Mm-hmm.

43:03.808 --> 43:06.713
Uh... look buddy,

43:06.714 --> 43:08.784
if... if you don't have it,

43:08.785 --> 43:11.624
there's no way that you
could've given it to her.

43:13.060 --> 43:14.462
I couldn't?

43:14.463 --> 43:18.470
No, but it means she, uh, got it from...

43:18.471 --> 43:19.440
somewhere else.

43:20.475 --> 43:21.843
Like from a toilet seat?

43:21.844 --> 43:24.081
Uh...

43:24.082 --> 43:26.853
no, no.

43:26.854 --> 43:28.491
More like, um...

43:30.762 --> 43:32.598
Another guy's dick.

43:34.135 --> 43:35.671
I was just trying to
be a good mom, Fiona.

43:35.672 --> 43:37.608
You are so lucky that they called me

43:37.609 --> 43:38.944
and not the police.

43:38.945 --> 43:40.948
I mean, you realize they
can take Harry away

43:40.949 --> 43:41.983
if you get arrested.

43:41.984 --> 43:43.487
They could also take her away

43:43.488 --> 43:45.023
if they think I'm special needs, Fiona.

43:45.024 --> 43:46.225
Wait, whoa... whoa, what happened?

43:46.226 --> 43:48.029
She was shoplifting. You believe that?

43:48.030 --> 43:49.364
Fuckin' Prada diapers.

43:49.365 --> 43:51.068
Huh. My money was on stripping.

43:51.069 --> 43:53.607
I was gonna sell them for
money to pay Jolayemi.

43:53.608 --> 43:55.411
I-I just wanted to get sleep at night

43:55.412 --> 43:56.980
so I could be a good mom.

43:56.981 --> 43:59.017
Good moms stick around,

43:59.018 --> 44:00.854
and going to jail would
drastically affect

44:00.855 --> 44:02.693
your ability to do that.

44:05.097 --> 44:06.866
You really think I was
making money stripping?

44:06.867 --> 44:08.837
Don't get any ideas.

44:08.838 --> 44:10.006
Where you going now?

44:10.007 --> 44:12.010
I have a job. And so do you.

44:12.011 --> 44:13.814
Aren't you supposed to be
washing dishes tonight?

44:13.815 --> 44:16.318
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

44:18.558 --> 44:20.293
Oh, my God.

44:20.294 --> 44:22.363
What have you done?

44:22.364 --> 44:25.036
Okay, easy, easy, easy.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.238
Papa Frank's got this.

44:26.239 --> 44:28.008
Calm down.

44:28.009 --> 44:30.848
Uh, they're closing the
homeless shelter on Winslow,

44:30.849 --> 44:32.518
so we decided to move in here.

44:32.519 --> 44:34.989
Sir, who gave you permission
to occupy these premises?

44:34.990 --> 44:36.760
Uh, the Statue of Liberty when she said,

44:36.761 --> 44:39.364
"Give me your tired, your
poor, your huddled masses."

44:39.365 --> 44:42.170
Jesus Christ when he washed
the feet of the homeless

44:42.171 --> 44:43.774
and also shared with them his wine.

44:43.775 --> 44:47.615
And finally, uh, the
owner of this residence.

44:47.616 --> 44:49.117
That's a lie. They're trespassing.

44:49.118 --> 44:50.621
Where is the owner?

44:50.622 --> 44:52.056
He's on a Norwegian cruise
at the moment, but...

44:52.057 --> 44:53.527
I didn't have any trouble reaching him

44:53.528 --> 44:54.695
just a little while ago.

44:54.696 --> 44:56.666
How would you even have his number?

44:56.667 --> 44:58.870
I've lived in this neighborhood
for I don't know how long.

44:58.871 --> 45:00.974
I was very close with the old aunt.

45:00.975 --> 45:02.377
She gave me the number a long time ago,

45:02.378 --> 45:03.480
in case of emergency.

45:03.481 --> 45:04.515
What's his name then?

45:04.516 --> 45:06.419
If you don't know that,

45:06.420 --> 45:07.721
I'm not going to tell...

45:07.722 --> 45:09.692
Oh, Sylvie.

45:09.693 --> 45:12.063
Sylvie has trouble letting go, Officer.

45:12.064 --> 45:14.068
She always has.

45:15.772 --> 45:17.408
I'm sorry, lady, but I think

45:17.409 --> 45:18.743
this is one for the courts.

45:18.744 --> 45:20.079
You must be joking.

45:20.080 --> 45:21.916
- This man is...
- I know who he is.

45:21.917 --> 45:23.920
And I know he's probably lying.

45:23.921 --> 45:25.524
But I'm not about to arrest

45:25.525 --> 45:27.227
a couple of dozen homeless
people and their kids

45:27.228 --> 45:28.864
when it's your word against his.

45:28.865 --> 45:30.199
If you can get the owner on the phone...

45:30.200 --> 45:31.469
I told you I can't.

45:31.470 --> 45:33.406
Thank you for your service.

45:33.407 --> 45:34.909
And thank you for your protection.

45:34.910 --> 45:37.313
You be careful out there, okay?

45:37.314 --> 45:38.617
Promise?

45:38.618 --> 45:40.622
Thanks for dropping by, okay?

45:41.657 --> 45:42.791
Thank you.

45:48.103 --> 45:49.439
When's dinner?

45:59.626 --> 46:01.061
What the fuck?

47:41.930 --> 47:43.198
Daddy Frank?

47:51.048 --> 47:52.484
Can I help you?

47:52.485 --> 47:56.493
Sweet Sister, I surely hope you can.

48:01.870 --> 48:03.373
Mm-hmm?

48:04.809 --> 48:06.344
Hey, Fi.

48:06.345 --> 48:07.714
Uh, there's only a
couple stragglers left.

48:07.715 --> 48:09.418
Cool for me to clock out?

48:09.419 --> 48:11.389
You know the woman who owns this place

48:11.390 --> 48:12.891
dropped out of high school,

48:12.892 --> 48:15.897
and now she owns, like,
half the South Side

48:15.898 --> 48:18.570
and a whole neighborhood
in Indianapolis?

48:18.571 --> 48:21.842
Jesus. She must've
worked her ass off, huh?

48:21.843 --> 48:22.778
Never got married.

48:22.779 --> 48:24.113
Never had kids.

48:24.114 --> 48:25.517
Paid her dues.

48:25.518 --> 48:27.053
Invested her money.

48:27.054 --> 48:29.558
Leveraged it, whatever
the fuck that means.

48:29.559 --> 48:31.395
Holy shit.

48:31.396 --> 48:33.365
She's worth 300 million?

48:33.366 --> 48:34.803
Yeah.

48:39.813 --> 48:42.551
So it's cool if I go?

48:42.552 --> 48:43.887
Mm-hmm.

49:08.937 --> 49:10.808
It wasn't me, okay? I'm clean.

49:15.618 --> 49:18.322
What is this? Where is she?

49:18.323 --> 49:19.958
She's supposed to be at Latisha's.

49:19.959 --> 49:22.932
Unless Latisha's the name
of a college, she's not.

49:24.569 --> 49:26.973
Are those Greek letters on
that motherfuckin' house?

49:29.446 --> 49:31.181
Do you remember where this place is?

49:31.182 --> 49:32.784
Yeah.

49:32.785 --> 49:33.953
Come on.

50:11.095 --> 50:13.198
Yo, does anybody need a coffee?

50:13.199 --> 50:14.233
Beer?

50:14.234 --> 50:15.670
- Beer.
- Beer.

50:15.671 --> 50:16.672
Right.

50:27.929 --> 50:31.234
- Is there gonna be gunfire?
- I sure as shit hope so.

50:32.405 --> 50:33.773
Go. Go, go, go.

50:35.243 --> 50:36.244
Police! Open the
door, motherfuck...!

50:37.748 --> 50:40.285
Dear God, thank you for Daddy Frank.

50:40.286 --> 50:43.091
He's the best new daddy we've ever had.

50:43.092 --> 50:45.497
And please let him let
me be a boy named Dan

50:45.498 --> 50:47.167
starting tomorrow.

50:49.171 --> 50:50.573
Good night, kids.

50:50.574 --> 50:52.611
Good night, Daddy Frank.

50:52.612 --> 50:54.716
You want a quick BJ, Daddy Frank?

50:56.586 --> 50:58.088
That's just not right.

51:08.544 --> 51:09.912
What's going on?

51:09.913 --> 51:11.415
Called a family meeting.

51:11.416 --> 51:12.984
'Cause apparently she's the queen.

51:12.985 --> 51:14.488
Hey, don't start shit.

51:14.489 --> 51:15.723
You stay up all night
with a screaming baby

51:15.724 --> 51:16.625
and tell me that.

51:16.626 --> 51:17.794
I'm not invited?

51:17.795 --> 51:19.498
I just didn't want to wake you.

51:19.499 --> 51:20.900
How'd you sleep?

51:20.901 --> 51:22.404
Good. Slept all night.

51:22.405 --> 51:24.408
You guys mind? I-I got to get to work.

51:24.409 --> 51:26.311
- Yep.
- All right.

51:26.312 --> 51:30.587
So, it used to be that
we had a squirrel fight

51:30.588 --> 51:32.490
and everybody contributed
what they could,

51:32.491 --> 51:37.132
but I'd carry the bulk of it
because I was the only grown-up.

51:37.133 --> 51:40.339
But times passed, and
things have changed.

51:40.340 --> 51:42.711
Most of us are grown-ups now.

51:42.712 --> 51:45.215
Or at least pretending to be.

51:45.216 --> 51:47.353
So, I ran the numbers

51:47.354 --> 51:50.960
and I came up with a system
that I think is fair.

51:50.961 --> 51:53.098
- What's this?
- That's your share.

51:53.099 --> 51:55.503
That's what you have to pay
every month towards the bills

51:55.504 --> 51:56.839
if you want to stay here.

51:56.840 --> 51:59.076
If we want to stay here?

51:59.077 --> 52:00.580
If you want us all to stay together.

52:00.581 --> 52:01.782
To stay a family.

52:01.783 --> 52:03.519
Otherwise, I'll rent out your rooms

52:03.520 --> 52:05.690
or sell the house

52:05.691 --> 52:07.359
and everyone can fend for themselves.

52:07.360 --> 52:09.631
Why is mine higher than Carl's?

52:09.632 --> 52:13.271
'Cause Carl doesn't need diapers
and rash cream and baby food.

52:13.272 --> 52:16.310
I fired Jolayemi because I can't
afford to pay her anymore.

52:16.311 --> 52:19.316
How am I gonna afford $375?

52:19.317 --> 52:20.887
You're not in school, Debs.

52:20.888 --> 52:22.490
You could get a job.

52:22.491 --> 52:24.895
Who's gonna watch the baby?

52:24.896 --> 52:26.699
Not my problem.

52:26.700 --> 52:29.471
The house belongs to me. I'm
not gonna be paying rent.

52:29.472 --> 52:31.742
The house and the bills
are all in my name,

52:31.743 --> 52:34.013
and it's my credit that's
fucked if we don't pay.

52:34.014 --> 52:35.516
And it's not rent.

52:35.517 --> 52:38.389
It's water and power and property taxes.

52:38.390 --> 52:40.593
Since when do you care
about your credit?

52:40.594 --> 52:42.764
Since now.

52:42.765 --> 52:45.235
The only one who gets a free
ride around here anymore

52:45.236 --> 52:46.538
is Liam.

52:46.539 --> 52:48.041
So if you're out of work,

52:48.042 --> 52:51.483
file for disability or
welfare or get a job.

52:53.487 --> 52:55.123
Also...

52:57.561 --> 52:59.798
I want you all to put me at the bottom

52:59.799 --> 53:01.735
of your emergency contact list.

53:01.736 --> 53:03.572
Put Lip first,

53:03.573 --> 53:05.242
and then Ian,

53:05.243 --> 53:07.346
and then Kev and V,

53:07.347 --> 53:10.352
and then me.

53:10.353 --> 53:12.824
Because I have a plan for my life,

53:12.825 --> 53:15.696
and I can't do it if I'm getting
a call every five minutes

53:15.697 --> 53:18.234
about one of you.

53:18.235 --> 53:21.207
And just so we're clear,

53:21.208 --> 53:23.612
I am just as likely as
anyone else in this family

53:23.613 --> 53:26.083
to make something of myself,

53:26.084 --> 53:27.687
and it's about time you got that,

53:27.688 --> 53:30.459
you arrogant shit.

53:30.460 --> 53:33.198
You see what Frank's
doing down the block?

53:40.279 --> 53:41.615
Pile it on, friends.

53:41.616 --> 53:44.086
Don't be shy. Get your fill.

53:44.087 --> 53:47.427
God does not want you to go out
into your busy day of begging

53:47.428 --> 53:50.399
without a full belly.

53:50.400 --> 53:51.602
Wow.

53:51.603 --> 53:53.772
My family is really
upping the ante, huh?

53:53.773 --> 53:54.941
Tell me about it.

53:54.942 --> 53:56.745
I got three kids, a wife, a husband,

53:56.746 --> 53:58.415
and a father-in-law with a giant johnson

53:58.416 --> 54:00.085
that I've seen twice already.

54:00.086 --> 54:02.089
- What?
- We have a lot to catch up on.

54:02.090 --> 54:03.258
What is this?

54:03.259 --> 54:05.863
Looks like Communist Russia.

54:05.864 --> 54:07.567
"Gallagher Home for the Homeless"?

54:07.568 --> 54:09.370
That shit smells good.

54:09.371 --> 54:12.242
Hey, Frank, you can't have
a homeless shelter here.

54:12.243 --> 54:15.048
I beg to differ, neighbor.

54:15.049 --> 54:16.652
- Mama!
- Aww.
