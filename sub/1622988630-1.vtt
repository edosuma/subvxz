'Cause you graduated.
For me it was like ka-ching.

And the fact that this place
is no longer hiring Scarers.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.433
I mean, I got this letter
saying that I was gonna be a Scarer,

09:18.517 --> 09:20.853

I lived in the Scarribean for a year.

Hey, everybody, meet the new guy!
Tylor Tuskmon.

11:02.246 --> 11:03.997
-Hi.
-We were best buds in college.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.165
We had one class together.

11:05.249 --> 11:07.209
-But it was special.
-We didn't actually speak.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.877
Hi, everyone, just to be clear,

11:08.961 --> 11:11.588
I was told this is
a temporary reassignment.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.591
Well, we'll see about that, won't we?
I'm Fritz.

11:14.675 --> 11:17.761
Oh, they said they were sending over
a new MIFTer.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.931
-Sorry, what exactly is "MIFT"?
-What is MIFT?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.266
Oh, now you've done it.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.355
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

11:28.438 --> 11:31.817
Since the day Monsters, Inc. was founded,
there has been a need.

11:31.900 --> 11:36.154
A need for a dedicated team of mechanics
to nurture the intricate machinery

11:36.238 --> 11:39.491
that is the very foundation
of this factory.

11:39.575 --> 11:42.786
No matter how arduous
or difficult the repair might be,

11:42.870 --> 11:45.455
MIFT is there to tighten the bolts,

11:45.539 --> 11:50.544
unclog the pipes, wrench the nut.
We embrace it with, uh...

11:51.420 --> 11:54.047
-We embrace it with...
-With unbridled anticipation.

There you go! Unbridled participation
of what challenge lies ahead.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.596

12:00.679 --> 12:02.389
-"I'm proud."

For the record,
I've never actually said that.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.482
Oh, welcome to the MIFT family.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.902
Uh, thanks, but I'm not really family.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.612
I could be to you like a father figure.

12:16.695 --> 12:17.988
My father's a father figure.

-That's my father's father.

could I just borrow you for a sec?

forever hammering into your brain.

13:26.557 --> 13:29.768
But look, the MIFT team,
they mean well, all right?

13:29.852 --> 13:31.854
You're gonna warm up to 'em, I promise.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.772
-I don't belong here.

-Hi, Duncan.

13:45.075 --> 13:48.036
But people around here refer to me
as "Deputy Supervisor."

13:48.871 --> 13:52.791
You know why? Because when Fritz retires
or dies, I'm takin' his job.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.043
You can forget
your little "college boy" plan...

13:55.127 --> 13:56.670
-Wait, what?
-...of waltzing in here

you understand?
