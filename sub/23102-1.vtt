Outstanding job, as usual.

00:22.343 --> 00:24.167
Your fee has been transferred.

00:24.169 --> 00:27.656
Whatever you do, do not play the file.

01:15.991 --> 01:19.158
Whatever you do, do not play the file.

01:25.159 --> 01:27.862
Ladies and gentlemen and welcome to

01:27.864 --> 01:31.466
our cinematic event of
Space Boobs In Space.

01:31.468 --> 01:34.110
I am Zee Zee Poof and we are here to watch

01:34.112 --> 01:38.279
the historical dramatization
of a very important event.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.299
We are here tonight with the director,

01:42.301 --> 01:46.005
with the led actress and
for cultural context,

01:46.007 --> 01:48.674
the one and only Grand Muff Tit.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.519
It's going to be an amazing evening,

01:51.521 --> 01:53.819
stay tuned for Space Boobs In Space

01:53.821 --> 01:54.873
and we'll be right back.

02:11.955 --> 02:15.122
Citizens of Iralane, my daughter has

02:15.981 --> 02:19.205
sent back mission reports
from her expedition

02:19.207 --> 02:22.707
to the planet Earth, home of that glorious

02:23.708 --> 02:26.041
natural resource, the titty.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.836
As we await her return,

02:30.838 --> 02:32.421
I council patience.

02:34.528 --> 02:37.945
This voyage promises a future in which no

02:38.834 --> 02:43.001
Iralanian will be without
the milk of the human breast.

02:45.314 --> 02:48.575
No longer will we rely on the antiquated

02:48.577 --> 02:52.952
filtration systems that
harvest the unsuitable

02:52.954 --> 02:56.287
nectar of the breasts of our home world.

02:57.917 --> 03:00.334
Be strong and stand together.

03:02.352 --> 03:06.435
We will yet bathe in the
fountain of their teats.

Yes, Vizier, what news?

03:58.251 --> 04:00.334
Well, Your Majesty, um,

04:05.751 --> 04:08.787
your daughter has not yet
returned from her mission and

04:08.789 --> 04:10.456
her charges died and

04:12.073 --> 04:16.065
her cargo was spoiled
due to space bacteria.

04:16.067 --> 04:16.901
Indeed.

04:17.750 --> 04:21.249
Why, why must the
precious milk of the titty

04:21.250 --> 04:24.233
be so vulnerable to space bacteria?

04:24.235 --> 04:26.485
Vizier, we are not alone.

04:28.553 --> 04:30.931
Yes, yes Your Majesty.

04:30.933 --> 04:33.506
Of course, Your Majesty.

04:33.508 --> 04:36.450
Send a shuttle for the Princess.

04:36.452 --> 04:38.693
It's already been sent.

04:38.695 --> 04:42.211
And what are our alternate plans?

04:42.213 --> 04:43.046
I've had

04:44.449 --> 04:47.371
something going for awhile now.

04:47.373 --> 04:49.769
I sent a beacon out

04:49.771 --> 04:51.521
with our coordinates,

04:52.631 --> 04:54.593
also a little music,

04:54.595 --> 04:57.826
humans are very susceptible to lures.

04:57.828 --> 05:01.588
Hopefully, some of them
will find our beacon and

05:01.590 --> 05:04.473
make their way here and we can

05:04.475 --> 05:06.510
use them as specimens to create

05:06.512 --> 05:09.095
our valuable milk of the titty.

05:10.789 --> 05:12.486
Excellent,

05:12.488 --> 05:15.905
report when you have further information.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.031
You are dismissed.

05:34.765 --> 05:35.596
Captain's log,

05:35.598 --> 05:37.098
January 7th, 2092.

05:38.202 --> 05:40.440
We are nearing the origin of the strange

05:40.442 --> 05:42.528
message that has driven the space program

05:42.530 --> 05:45.906
on our planet for the last 75 years.

05:45.908 --> 05:48.863
It has been a long journey
and First Mate Fonda

05:48.865 --> 05:50.939
is eager to be on solid ground

05:50.941 --> 05:53.717
and I can't say I blame her

05:53.719 --> 05:55.264
but now that we are so close,

05:55.266 --> 05:57.336
I am preoccupied with
concern for the safety

05:57.338 --> 05:59.255
of my crew and my ship.

06:00.177 --> 06:01.777
We may be making the first contact

06:01.779 --> 06:04.238
with an alien life form.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.954
My next report will be
from the surface of the

06:05.956 --> 06:07.039
alien planet.

06:07.921 --> 06:10.879
This is Captain Weaver, signing out.

06:16.465 --> 06:19.900
Your Majesty, I have news to report.

06:19.902 --> 06:20.735
Speak.

06:21.847 --> 06:23.644
We have confirmed visual sighting

06:23.646 --> 06:25.740
of a human spacecraft.

06:25.742 --> 06:27.835
It would appear that the
Grand Vizier's messages

06:27.837 --> 06:30.212
have been effective.

06:30.214 --> 06:31.719
The spacecraft has landed approximately

06:31.721 --> 06:34.755
four farks into the wetlands.

06:34.757 --> 06:36.337
I humbly request permission

06:36.339 --> 06:40.422
to represent our government
in greeting the crew.

06:41.601 --> 06:42.601
Excellent,

06:43.801 --> 06:45.837
take one of my guards,

06:45.839 --> 06:50.539
go and see whether they can
be interacted with safely

06:50.541 --> 06:54.312
and assess their titties for viability.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.292
Yes, Your Majesty.

07:41.178 --> 07:44.293
So far this planet seems
like a safe environment,

07:44.295 --> 07:45.756
would you agree, Fonda?

07:45.758 --> 07:48.732
I suspect everything, Captain.

07:48.734 --> 07:51.392
These plants are alien life forms,

07:51.394 --> 07:55.480
we do not know what the
primary sentient life form is.

07:55.482 --> 07:56.399
These rocks

07:58.157 --> 08:00.634
could be life forms.

08:00.636 --> 08:03.136
I don't think that rock
sent us a series of notes

08:03.138 --> 08:05.889
and a set of coordinates, Fonda.

08:05.891 --> 08:08.651
Rocks may be living things

08:08.653 --> 08:11.896
and even musically
inclined on this planet.

08:11.898 --> 08:14.981
That exterior could be a exoskeleton.

08:16.552 --> 08:18.374
They may communicate

08:18.376 --> 08:19.293
with music.

08:20.729 --> 08:21.973
I know it seems safe,

08:21.975 --> 08:24.373
but chances are pretty
slim that we'll encounter

08:24.375 --> 08:28.115
a recognizable bipedal
form on this planet.

08:28.117 --> 08:31.592
We must be prepared for
everything, Captain.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.530
Fine, you're the one that studied

08:33.533 --> 08:36.409
theoretical extraterrestrial biology.

08:36.412 --> 08:39.162
Rocks transmitting sounds, right.

08:43.476 --> 08:46.976
♪ Do Re Me Fa So La Te Do

08:58.419 --> 09:00.855
Oh my god, Fonda, look!

09:00.857 --> 09:01.690
Greetings.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.011
We are visitors,

09:06.013 --> 09:08.346
do you have spoken language?

09:09.437 --> 09:11.187
Do you understand us?

09:15.480 --> 09:17.237
Greetings, Humans. I have been sent

09:17.239 --> 09:19.671
to welcome you to our
planet and escort you

09:19.673 --> 09:21.556
to the palace immediately.

09:21.558 --> 09:25.114
Your cooperation would
be greatly appreciated.

09:25.116 --> 09:27.372
Your hospitality is greatly appreciated,

09:27.374 --> 09:29.137
we would like to learn
more about your culture

09:29.139 --> 09:32.835
before we travel from within
the vicinity of our ship.

09:32.837 --> 09:35.255
How far is the palace from here?

09:35.257 --> 09:37.757
We are so happy to meet you.

09:38.636 --> 09:41.734
I have been sent to
welcome you to our planet

09:41.736 --> 09:45.072
and escort you to the palace immediately.

09:45.074 --> 09:47.794
Your cooperation would
be greatly appreciated,

09:47.796 --> 09:51.834
only the Queen can share
information with you.

09:51.836 --> 09:53.053
We don't know their ways,

09:53.055 --> 09:55.457
culturally, this could be a huge misstep

09:55.459 --> 09:58.211
to let the Goodwill
Ambassador speak with us first

09:58.213 --> 09:59.893
before the Queen does.

09:59.895 --> 10:03.259
This could be the only way
to precede with our mission.

10:03.261 --> 10:04.368
Very well.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.510
We will need more
information on the distance

10:06.512 --> 10:09.997
of the palace from our
ship and a guarantee

10:09.999 --> 10:13.713
that we will returned to our ship safely.

10:13.715 --> 10:15.954
Thank you for your cooperation.

10:15.956 --> 10:17.556
If you'll follow me this way

10:17.558 --> 10:21.312
and I am not the Goodwill Ambassador,

10:21.314 --> 10:23.490
I'm the Captain of the Guard,

10:23.492 --> 10:26.069
what you would call military.

10:53.874 --> 10:57.624
Welcome, you must now
submit for examination.

10:58.518 --> 10:59.875
We must make sure you're safe before

10:59.877 --> 11:03.627
we take you into the
presence of Her Majesty.

11:05.339 --> 11:08.216
I can see that you
are only doing your job

11:08.218 --> 11:12.112
and as a gesture of
goodwill, we will allow this.

11:12.947 --> 11:14.648
Bring out Platypus.

12:03.174 --> 12:04.635
Alright, that's enough,

12:04.637 --> 12:06.353
you must be able to tell that

12:06.355 --> 12:08.395
we aren't carrying any diseases and that

12:08.397 --> 12:10.614
we have no hidden weapons.

12:10.616 --> 12:12.199
This is ridiculous.

12:13.671 --> 12:15.194
Very well,

12:15.196 --> 12:16.913
I can tell that you are both healthy

12:16.915 --> 12:19.575
and your titties appear to
be viable candidates for

12:19.577 --> 12:20.994
heavy production.

12:22.099 --> 12:25.231
You must be very proud of
this physical superiority.

12:25.233 --> 12:28.033
I will take you to our Queen.

12:35.576 --> 12:39.332
Your Majesty, I have brought
you the viable human titties.

12:39.334 --> 12:41.294
Now, see here.

12:41.296 --> 12:42.972
Greetings, Human.

12:42.974 --> 12:47.255
Please forgive the eager
declaration of my military leader.

12:47.257 --> 12:52.095
She is understandably moved
by this historic moment.

12:52.097 --> 12:54.347
You are dismissed, Captain.

12:57.637 --> 12:59.196
Uh, well, yes,

12:59.198 --> 13:03.057
the Federated Allied Government of Earth

13:03.059 --> 13:06.309
sends their greet, did she say titties?

13:07.958 --> 13:12.189
I-I think she said, I
know she said titties.

13:12.191 --> 13:13.854
Misinterpretation and miscommunication

13:13.856 --> 13:17.391
is very common with two
cultures that have first met.

13:17.393 --> 13:19.485
I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but,

13:19.487 --> 13:23.404
in our language, a titty
is a part of the body.

13:25.777 --> 13:27.316
Yes.

13:27.318 --> 13:29.068
The breast, the teat,

13:30.653 --> 13:34.357
you are both blessed with
functioning mammary glands.

13:34.359 --> 13:36.569
How joyous for you

13:36.571 --> 13:40.738
and for us, my people are
in great need of your milk.

13:41.580 --> 13:43.611
My Grand Vizier will be looking forward

13:43.613 --> 13:46.670
to meeting with you and
she will give you more

13:46.672 --> 13:50.531
information about your future with us.

13:50.533 --> 13:51.616
Our future?

13:55.351 --> 13:57.294
I see discussions have begun.

13:57.296 --> 14:01.015
Vizier, you will speak
with these breast bearers?

14:01.017 --> 14:04.185
Which is a fascinating
cultural anomaly, really.

14:04.187 --> 14:06.070
I'll get this sorted out, ladies.

14:06.072 --> 14:08.172
You're the leader?

14:08.174 --> 14:09.005
Yes.

14:09.007 --> 14:09.838
Come with me.

14:38.220 --> 14:39.917
You should know that
our government will not

14:39.919 --> 14:44.073
negotiate with a government
that uses aggressive tactics.

14:44.075 --> 14:47.821
We will not have our milk taken forcibly.

14:47.823 --> 14:50.635
Calm down, we're just here to talk.

14:50.637 --> 14:52.197
Hypnotized subjects

14:52.199 --> 14:54.949
don't respond well to milking and

14:56.198 --> 14:58.355
the milk spoils.

14:58.357 --> 15:01.015
We thought about milking farms,

15:01.017 --> 15:03.337
but humans are so unwieldy.

15:03.339 --> 15:04.376
Oh, that's true,

15:04.378 --> 15:05.753
we make terrible cattle,

15:05.755 --> 15:07.540
we are much more excitable than most...

15:07.542 --> 15:08.373
Fonda!

15:08.375 --> 15:10.847
Grand Vizier, we will need to know more

15:10.849 --> 15:12.484
about your planet and the resources that

15:12.486 --> 15:13.986
you have to offer.

15:14.825 --> 15:18.666
Earth requires additional
fuel sources and food.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.702
We also need some new techniques in order

15:20.704 --> 15:24.024
to clean our air and environment.

15:24.026 --> 15:27.165
Yes, our research has shown us that your

15:27.167 --> 15:29.823
natural environment is quite damaged.

15:29.825 --> 15:32.105
We don't have the same
problem here, of course,

15:32.107 --> 15:35.106
but we cannot, due to our long lifespan,

15:35.108 --> 15:38.424
long life is a tremendous motivator.

15:38.426 --> 15:39.506
Long lifespan,

15:39.508 --> 15:41.886
I would love to study your species,

15:41.888 --> 15:43.460
that sounds really fascinating,

15:43.462 --> 15:45.509
do you have any scientists
that I could talk to?

15:45.511 --> 15:47.744
Um, I mean like, just sit down for a day

15:47.746 --> 15:48.829
or something.

15:50.808 --> 15:52.707
Well, unlike your precious milk,

15:52.709 --> 15:54.704
our own green breast nectar

15:54.706 --> 15:58.088
has only horrible side effects.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.508
We try to minimize skin
contact with it, of course,

16:00.510 --> 16:02.093
but it's difficult.

16:03.349 --> 16:06.308
As a side effect, extends our life

16:06.310 --> 16:08.643
and makes us invulnerable to

16:10.786 --> 16:12.863
fine lines and wrinkles.

16:12.865 --> 16:14.528
Your breasts

16:14.530 --> 16:17.030
prevent aging and extend life?

16:19.667 --> 16:20.728
Yes.

16:20.730 --> 16:21.561
Woo.

16:21.563 --> 16:22.689
It's terrible.

16:22.691 --> 16:25.226
We have to minimize reproduction.

16:25.228 --> 16:27.990
My grandmother and I seem
to be about the same age.

16:27.992 --> 16:31.575
Our Queen is about 800
of your Earth years.

16:33.628 --> 16:36.326
I think we can arrange
a trade agreement.

16:53.516 --> 16:55.569
I look forward to their return.

16:55.571 --> 16:57.769
They were nice for humans.

16:57.771 --> 17:00.430
They had nice titties.

17:02.676 --> 17:06.249
Captain's log, January 9th, 2092,

17:06.251 --> 17:08.009
so much has happened.

17:08.011 --> 17:10.567
We've made contact with an alien race

17:10.569 --> 17:13.304
and developed a new trade partnership

17:13.306 --> 17:15.050
that will most likely benefit

17:15.053 --> 17:17.814
all the peoples on Earth.

17:17.816 --> 17:20.989
The imports will change
our entire way of life

17:20.991 --> 17:23.324
and the circumstances, well,

17:25.153 --> 17:29.453
I think that's something
better outlined in person.

17:29.455 --> 17:30.788
Hey, hey, hey.

17:32.231 --> 17:34.973
We're gonna live forever.

17:40.055 --> 17:42.230
Oh, okay, that's weird.

Yeah.

19:20.408 --> 19:21.239
Cut.

19:22.737 --> 19:23.935
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.

19:23.937 --> 19:26.799
I hope you enjoyed Space Boobs In Space.

19:26.801 --> 19:29.655
We are here with the Earth director,

19:29.657 --> 19:32.740
human Earth Director, Andrew Shearer?

19:33.989 --> 19:35.554
That's right, that's right, yeah.

19:35.556 --> 19:37.573
He is a beautiful Earth man

19:37.575 --> 19:40.165
and he directed this very
important, historical

19:40.167 --> 19:43.232
dramatization, I love drama.

19:43.234 --> 19:45.104
Tell us, tell us what was

19:45.106 --> 19:49.144
the most important part
of making this film?

19:49.146 --> 19:50.227
Boobs.

19:50.229 --> 19:52.811
Well, thank you so much for
this enlightening interview.

19:52.813 --> 19:55.527
We have so many other
interviews coming up.

19:55.529 --> 19:57.128
Would you like to introduce them?

19:57.130 --> 19:57.961
Sure.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.906
A guy we had to do the interviews,

19:59.908 --> 20:01.589
he shows up to the thing, he's drunk,

20:01.591 --> 20:03.150
he's throwing up behind the couch,

20:03.152 --> 20:04.441
made everybody sick, it's terrible.

20:04.443 --> 20:06.016
So, um,

20:06.018 --> 20:08.769
but what I got is some Foreign Press.

20:08.771 --> 20:10.061
Some Foreign Press?

20:10.063 --> 20:11.581
Yeah, he's a guy and I can't really

20:11.583 --> 20:12.485
understand what he's saying but

20:12.487 --> 20:13.940
the actors were great.

20:13.942 --> 20:15.236
Everybody's gonna love it.

20:15.238 --> 20:17.901
Okay, well get ready
for this enlightening

20:17.903 --> 20:19.840
interviews and we'll be right back with

20:19.842 --> 20:24.298
the lead actress and the
Grand Muff Tit is still

20:24.300 --> 20:26.254
coming, she will be here too.

20:26.256 --> 20:27.087
See you soon.

20:28.579 --> 20:31.777
I'm here on the
set of Space Boobs In Space.

20:31.779 --> 20:34.002
I am here with the Coquette De Jour.

20:34.004 --> 20:35.170
Bonjour.

20:35.172 --> 20:38.323
And she's sewing
her own costume, it appears.

20:38.325 --> 20:41.807
Ms. De Jour, do you not have an assistant

20:41.809 --> 20:43.971
who will make this for you?

20:43.973 --> 20:47.854
You must do your own work
on the set of this movie?

20:48.689 --> 20:49.920
What is it like to make

20:49.922 --> 20:51.796
a movie with the Americans?

20:51.798 --> 20:53.015
Oh, um,

20:53.017 --> 20:54.013
it is good,

20:54.015 --> 20:56.218
they always ask me to do

20:56.220 --> 20:58.553
ze American accent, so,

20:58.555 --> 21:01.171
which I think is very weird but...

21:01.173 --> 21:03.359
I don't, I don't like it but,

21:03.361 --> 21:05.919
what can you tell us about the character

21:05.921 --> 21:09.574
that you are playing in
Space Boobs From Space?

21:09.576 --> 21:11.741
Um, I am a scientist.

21:11.743 --> 21:16.197
I study theoretical
extraterrestrial biology.

21:16.199 --> 21:19.782
I get very excited
about culture and plants

21:20.723 --> 21:23.038
and singing rocks.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.876
Do you say
something to your fans in Brazil?

21:26.878 --> 21:29.461
Uh, I do not speak Brazilian.

21:30.378 --> 21:31.496
I just gitsem.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.857
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back,

21:34.859 --> 21:37.119
I hope you enjoyed it, the interviews.

21:37.121 --> 21:39.015
I love hearing when people talk about

21:39.017 --> 21:41.238
what they did on the film and on the set.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.821
It just makes the film so much better.

21:43.823 --> 21:46.445
Now, tell us, what did you think about

21:46.447 --> 21:47.438
what they were saying,

21:47.440 --> 21:49.543
what do you think about what actors

21:49.545 --> 21:52.125
reflect on what they did with you?

21:52.127 --> 21:53.686
Eh, I mean, no disrespect

21:53.688 --> 21:54.969
but they're a bunch of assholes.

21:54.971 --> 21:57.264
I see, assholes, I've heard of this.

21:57.266 --> 21:59.602
Coming up next we have some of,

21:59.604 --> 22:03.787
in honor, in honor of
this historical moment,

22:03.789 --> 22:05.685
between our cultures,

22:05.687 --> 22:06.707
when they integrate.

22:06.709 --> 22:08.866
This historical era in film,

22:08.868 --> 22:11.589
we have earthlings from your country.

22:11.591 --> 22:12.422
Hey, great.

22:12.424 --> 22:13.307
Earth.

22:14.851 --> 22:15.931
And we will be viewing,

22:15.933 --> 22:17.649

Yes.

23:59.197 --> 24:00.069
Okay.

24:00.071 --> 24:01.956
Alright, let's give this a try.

24:01.958 --> 24:02.789
How does this feel?

24:03.624 --> 24:04.709
Does that feel good?

24:06.219 --> 24:07.052
Yeah?

24:08.053 --> 24:09.352
Is that right?

24:09.354 --> 24:10.577
Maybe a little deeper?

24:10.579 --> 24:12.719
Okay, okay, I can do that.

24:12.721 --> 24:13.781
Like that?

24:13.783 --> 24:14.616
Uh-huh.

24:34.667 --> 24:35.945
Okay.

24:53.751 --> 24:54.584
Alright.

24:55.728 --> 24:56.561
Yeah.

♪ Through the night it

24:59.154 --> 25:01.904
♪ Night it comes

25:28.847 --> 25:30.424
So,

25:30.426 --> 25:32.660
per your instructions,

25:32.662 --> 25:34.986
you know, we pulled a couple of properties

25:34.988 --> 25:38.931
and we're looking for
things that were near,

25:38.933 --> 25:40.016
a summer camp

25:41.173 --> 25:43.712
but there's not really
anything on the market

25:43.714 --> 25:46.029
like that right now.

25:46.031 --> 25:48.450
You know, it's the wrong time of year.

25:48.452 --> 25:49.285
But,

25:50.234 --> 25:53.690
there's a really nice lake nearby,

25:53.692 --> 25:54.969
it's good stuff.

25:54.971 --> 25:55.967
Do you like water?

25:59.786 --> 26:01.322
That's real wood.

26:01.324 --> 26:02.407
That's value.

26:13.306 --> 26:15.086
As you can see,

26:15.088 --> 26:19.224
this lot features gorgeous, mature trees.

26:19.226 --> 26:21.745
They're really nice actually

26:21.747 --> 26:24.863
but should you decide to, you know,

26:24.865 --> 26:27.081
clear some of that away

26:27.083 --> 26:29.686
and if you wanted to build,

26:29.688 --> 26:31.688
that would be lovely too

26:34.448 --> 26:36.865
or you could leave it natural

26:38.308 --> 26:39.641
and undisturbed.

26:40.508 --> 26:42.591
Yeah, people do that too.

26:46.146 --> 26:49.325
You know, the way the
office described you,

26:49.327 --> 26:52.308
I thought you'd be taller.

26:57.807 --> 27:00.890
Now, it is a fairly private location.

27:01.946 --> 27:05.286
There is a neighborhood nearby but

27:05.288 --> 27:07.488
you may get the occasional jogger.

27:07.490 --> 27:10.147
I don't think they're
gonna disturb you too much.

27:10.149 --> 27:11.566
It's nice though.

27:13.667 --> 27:14.887
Hey.

27:14.889 --> 27:16.262
That's nice, isn't it?

27:16.264 --> 27:19.504
Jogging, getting that heart rate up.

27:19.506 --> 27:21.606
It's good stuff.

27:21.608 --> 27:22.525
Do you jog?

27:24.662 --> 27:25.495
Anything?

27:28.150 --> 27:29.983
Well, other than that,

27:30.907 --> 27:33.489
it's a lovely, lovely location.

27:33.491 --> 27:35.265
You know, you've got your trees,

27:35.267 --> 27:38.850
you've got your leaves,
you got your grass,

27:40.163 --> 27:42.289
yeah, close to a neighborhood

27:42.291 --> 27:44.268
but not too close 'cause finding that

27:44.270 --> 27:46.520
balance between privacy and

27:47.846 --> 27:50.648
being part of a community, it's wonderful

27:50.650 --> 27:53.829
but it is, it's really challenging
to find the right thing.

27:53.831 --> 27:55.664
So, what do you think?

28:02.092 --> 28:04.592
Okay.

28:13.123 --> 28:15.209
Yeah, no, I don't know where the office

28:15.211 --> 28:17.404
is finding these new clients.

28:17.406 --> 28:18.888
Apparently, since we've got all these

28:18.890 --> 28:20.484
Hollywood types coming into town,

28:20.486 --> 28:22.822
a lot of them are looking
for properties now

28:22.824 --> 28:24.445
but this is ridiculous.

28:24.447 --> 28:26.146
Yeah, this guy just walked away while

28:26.148 --> 28:29.466
I was showing the
property, just walked away.

28:29.468 --> 28:32.345
Uh-uh, right, you remember
the one from last week,

28:32.347 --> 28:33.643
the one with the stripey sweater

28:33.645 --> 28:35.747
and that skin condition?

28:35.749 --> 28:37.367
He just wanted to see properties

28:37.369 --> 28:39.342
that had boiler rooms.

28:39.344 --> 28:41.094
Who does that, right?

28:42.529 --> 28:46.266
Uh-uh, no, I don't need
the commission that bad.

28:46.268 --> 28:49.447
No, Mr. Walksaway, he can find his

28:49.449 --> 28:51.700
own way out of the woods.

29:30.351 --> 29:34.070
This property features
gorgeous, mature wooded trees,

29:34.072 --> 29:35.405
that's not a word.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.501
Close to the hustle and bustle

29:37.503 --> 29:41.007
but far from the hustle and bustle.

29:41.009 --> 29:44.047
Woo, it's real trees, yeah,

29:44.049 --> 29:45.506
you don't just get that anywhere,

29:45.508 --> 29:48.203
you get that here, out in nature.

29:48.205 --> 29:50.905
This is nice, I like this.

29:50.907 --> 29:54.190
Outdoor activities or a summer camp,

29:54.192 --> 29:59.007
but, you know, there's
nothing like that.

30:11.832 --> 30:13.788
Welcome back
ladies and gentlemen.

30:13.790 --> 30:17.230
I hope you enjoyed these
true depictions of life

30:17.232 --> 30:19.021
on the country of Earth.

30:19.023 --> 30:21.141
Why do real estate transactions

30:21.143 --> 30:25.042
on your planet require use of face guards?

30:25.044 --> 30:26.162
Oh, it's very important,

30:26.164 --> 30:28.159
it's dangerous work,
extremely dangerous work.

30:28.161 --> 30:28.992
Yes?

30:28.994 --> 30:29.911
You know,

30:29.913 --> 30:32.057
when you're out there in the woods and

30:32.059 --> 30:33.751
you know, a neighborhood,
anything like that,

30:33.753 --> 30:36.511
you gotta cover your face,
gotta cover your face.

30:36.513 --> 30:38.935
You, you couldn't walk around like this.

30:38.937 --> 30:40.415
No, no.

30:40.417 --> 30:41.360
I couldn't walk around like this.

30:41.362 --> 30:42.508
I mean, look at me.

30:42.510 --> 30:44.865
Now, the other question I have,

30:44.867 --> 30:47.628
the prominent question is

30:47.630 --> 30:50.048
do all your sexual proclivities include

30:50.050 --> 30:53.108
the use of children's
games based on surgery?

30:53.110 --> 30:57.049
Ah, what's a sexual,
what'd you say, sexual what?

30:57.051 --> 30:58.380
Proclivity.

30:58.382 --> 30:59.290
What is that?

30:59.292 --> 31:00.648
Your needs.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.848
Is that that thing that goes in the...

31:02.850 --> 31:04.073
Your desires.

31:04.075 --> 31:06.413
Okay, what did you say about kids?

31:06.415 --> 31:08.253
We're about to go to

31:08.255 --> 31:10.650
one more interview with
one of the cast members

31:10.652 --> 31:12.676
of this historical dramatization.

31:12.678 --> 31:14.069
Would you like to introduce them?

31:14.071 --> 31:15.933
Yeah, I know this one really good.

31:15.935 --> 31:18.272
This person um, yeah,

31:18.274 --> 31:20.031
things were missing all around the set

31:20.033 --> 31:21.070
after the shoot.

31:21.072 --> 31:21.903
Missing?

31:21.905 --> 31:23.265
Yeah, people's keys were
gone, jewelry was gone,

31:23.267 --> 31:25.128
a lot of things were gone

31:25.130 --> 31:26.883
and this person stole a lot of things

31:26.885 --> 31:28.547
from a lot of people.

31:28.549 --> 31:30.662
We had to make a full prostitution.

31:30.664 --> 31:32.630
Oh, goodness, well thank you for

31:32.632 --> 31:33.751
that introduction.

31:33.753 --> 31:34.584
Absolutely.

31:34.586 --> 31:36.090
Here's that interview
with that cast member.

31:37.945 --> 31:38.816
Tittiana Sprinkles,

31:38.818 --> 31:42.653
the Pandora in both say
that you are difficult

31:42.655 --> 31:44.929
and that you spit on the
face and I just want to know,

31:44.931 --> 31:46.409
is this true and if so,

31:46.411 --> 31:48.277
do you have message for them?

31:48.279 --> 31:51.078
I think they better back themselves up

31:51.080 --> 31:54.697
and check it 'cause
this right here, uh-uh,

31:54.699 --> 31:56.680
no, you just gotta get
outta the way of this,

31:56.682 --> 31:59.675
it's not my fault that I need, you know,

31:59.677 --> 32:01.812
exactly eight inches of mirror

32:01.814 --> 32:03.878
but they only gave me seven.

32:03.880 --> 32:08.435
Do you say
they have body odors?

32:08.437 --> 32:11.020
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

32:12.072 --> 32:12.905
I mean,

32:14.297 --> 32:15.710
so,

32:15.712 --> 32:16.736
yes.

32:16.738 --> 32:19.917
I want to watch the season

32:19.919 --> 32:21.954
of the Dukes of Hazzard where the original

32:21.956 --> 32:24.956
stars do not play Bo and Luke

32:24.958 --> 32:26.483
and it's probably not as good

32:26.485 --> 32:30.698
but I imagine this is, your
family is like Hee Haw?

32:30.700 --> 32:31.978
My family?

32:31.980 --> 32:32.845
Horrifying.

32:32.847 --> 32:34.159
You can tell when it's someone...

32:34.161 --> 32:37.577
We have loved having Earth
director Andrew Shearer

32:37.579 --> 32:38.967
here with us today.

32:38.969 --> 32:40.407
You are just beautiful,

32:40.409 --> 32:43.588
I want to lick your wrinkles,
they are so gorgeous.

32:43.590 --> 32:45.370
Take a number, you know.

32:45.372 --> 32:48.325
Thank you so much
for have me on the show

32:48.327 --> 32:50.292
and having us talk to you, bye bye.

32:52.326 --> 32:53.729
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

32:53.731 --> 32:57.036
we have a huge treat for you today.

32:57.038 --> 33:01.792
The one and only, descended
from the royal family

33:01.794 --> 33:05.635
of Iralane, the member of parliament,

33:05.637 --> 33:09.220
the illustrious, the
ancient, the gorgeous,

33:12.377 --> 33:16.525
Grand Muff Tit, Grand
Muff Tit, come, darling.

33:17.868 --> 33:20.545
Oh, hello, thank you for having me.

33:20.547 --> 33:21.526
So good to see you.

33:21.528 --> 33:24.231
It's wonderful to see
you, Zee Zee, my dear.

33:24.233 --> 33:25.392
You look so old.

33:25.394 --> 33:28.016
Oh, are you on AARP,

33:28.018 --> 33:30.756
which is a human, Earth word.

33:30.758 --> 33:33.357
I heard of this, I know this thing too.

33:33.359 --> 33:35.953
I feel like you could be on Medicare

33:35.955 --> 33:39.319
and no one would bat a lash, my darling.

33:39.321 --> 33:40.959
Oh, you are too kind.

33:40.961 --> 33:43.023
You're too kind.

33:43.025 --> 33:45.001
Now, Grand Muff Tit,

33:45.003 --> 33:47.753
you are descended from the woman,

33:49.340 --> 33:51.923
the pioneer who discovered that

33:54.079 --> 33:57.523
we could trade the breast
nectar to the humans

33:57.525 --> 33:59.422
for the milk of the titty.

33:59.424 --> 34:03.798
It was your great, great,
great, great, great,

34:03.800 --> 34:05.300
great grandmother?

34:07.765 --> 34:11.514
Yes, that's correct,
may she rest in peace.

34:13.623 --> 34:15.380
I didn't kill her, just in
case anyone was wondering.

34:15.382 --> 34:16.841
No, no, no, no.

34:16.842 --> 34:19.163
We will now see more interviews

34:19.165 --> 34:22.563
from this historical dramatization.

34:22.565 --> 34:25.181
Yes, they kicked me off the lot.

34:25.184 --> 34:27.023
They, they kicked you off the lot?

34:27.025 --> 34:28.300
I don't wanna talk about it.

34:28.302 --> 34:29.600
It's a court thing.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.260
Oh, I see.

34:31.262 --> 34:33.342
Very well, let us go to these interviews.

34:35.406 --> 34:36.376
Ms. Izzie Popp,

34:36.378 --> 34:40.545
tell us, what is the meaning
of Space Boobs In Space

34:42.744 --> 34:46.139
for the artistic statement,
what you are making

34:46.141 --> 34:47.978
from this film?

34:47.981 --> 34:50.481
We have something to do with

34:52.938 --> 34:56.541
I guess, interplanetary exploration.

34:56.543 --> 34:58.881
So it is a
metaphor, what you are saying,

34:58.883 --> 35:02.966
from the outer space is
to speak from interspace.

35:04.018 --> 35:05.597
That is correct.

35:05.599 --> 35:07.077
Could you
tell me a little bit

35:07.079 --> 35:08.413
about your character,

35:08.415 --> 35:10.415
it appears as very smart

35:10.417 --> 35:14.508
for what I would assume
is American astronaut?

35:14.510 --> 35:15.431
That's right.

35:15.433 --> 35:17.350
I am a ship captain and

35:18.933 --> 35:20.933
I am skeptical at first.

35:22.856 --> 35:26.577
It's fascinating to think of what it

35:26.579 --> 35:29.172
would be like in the
future when we do finally

35:29.174 --> 35:30.841
discover alien life.

35:33.237 --> 35:35.975
I think this
is why I will consider you

35:35.977 --> 35:40.335
a worthy thing for the
science fiction genre.

35:40.337 --> 35:41.373
Oh definitely.

35:41.375 --> 35:43.400
Mostly they
are transforming or they are

35:43.402 --> 35:45.757
Captain America and they are not...

35:45.759 --> 35:48.642
I think they will be breaking ground

35:48.644 --> 35:50.144
with this film and

35:52.481 --> 35:55.712
all audiences, whether they're American

35:55.714 --> 35:58.915
or international will greatly appreciate

35:58.917 --> 36:00.500
how realistic and...

36:02.437 --> 36:04.835
Pandora Disaster?

36:04.837 --> 36:06.096
Yes?

36:06.098 --> 36:07.403
I would like to know,

36:07.405 --> 36:10.283
first, how is it like to work with the

36:10.285 --> 36:14.006
behavior problems of Coquette Du Jour

36:14.008 --> 36:15.538
and of Izzie Popp?

36:15.540 --> 36:18.032
They like sitting around on the floors

36:18.034 --> 36:21.337
and do this bump and grind thing,

36:21.339 --> 36:23.422
I don't quite understand.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.250
In my country,

36:27.684 --> 36:29.267
it's no acceptable.

36:30.703 --> 36:32.500
You would be beheaded.

36:32.502 --> 36:34.041
Space Boobs From Space,

36:34.043 --> 36:37.045
why are they talk about the breasts

36:37.047 --> 36:39.760
and do you think the America
is ready for the boob?

36:39.762 --> 36:43.280
I think the American needs to understand

36:43.282 --> 36:46.615
that boobs, the tits, are glorious, yes.

36:49.104 --> 36:51.465
They are multi-functional and they are

36:51.467 --> 36:53.598
very pleasing to the eye.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.880
Do you think
that the violence is too much

36:56.882 --> 37:00.004
in the America, do you
think there is not enough

37:00.006 --> 37:03.701
of the bare exposed anus
and things like this

37:03.703 --> 37:06.669
instead of the bullet and the gun?

37:06.671 --> 37:09.254
I think the American needs to

37:10.426 --> 37:12.343
expand their mind, yes.

37:13.747 --> 37:17.802
They need to grow up,
stop that stupid nonsense,

37:17.804 --> 37:20.147
their ridiculous politics.

37:20.149 --> 37:23.982
They needs to understand
that art comes first.

39:20.953 --> 39:22.355
Welcome back.

39:22.357 --> 39:24.024
Now, Grand Muff Tit,

39:26.639 --> 39:29.316
I must know, I must ask you,

39:29.318 --> 39:32.479
why were you not included in the film?

39:32.481 --> 39:35.689
What happened, tell us everything.

39:35.691 --> 39:37.685
Well, you see,

39:37.687 --> 39:39.810
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

39:39.812 --> 39:42.010
I know, but you must, we're dying.

39:42.012 --> 39:45.762
I feel like you and
I are such close, close

39:47.132 --> 39:50.088
bosom buddies, if you will.

39:50.090 --> 39:51.349
Oh!

39:51.351 --> 39:53.991
That I can share it with you

39:53.993 --> 39:56.326
and your wonderful audience,

39:58.048 --> 40:00.381
despite the court gag order.

40:01.691 --> 40:05.387
The gentleman who was just
here earlier before me?

40:05.389 --> 40:06.825
Andrew Shearer, yes.

40:06.827 --> 40:08.994
That nefarious director,

40:11.989 --> 40:13.656
yes, Andrew Shearer.

40:15.971 --> 40:17.484
Yes, yes, what did he do,

40:17.486 --> 40:20.149
what did he do, tell us Grand Muff Tit,

40:20.151 --> 40:22.430
my breasts are heaving with emotion.

40:22.432 --> 40:24.810
Oh, speaking of heaving breasts,

40:24.812 --> 40:27.395
that is where the story begins.

40:30.288 --> 40:31.205
Imagine it,

40:32.132 --> 40:34.049
a closed Paramount lot,

40:35.673 --> 40:39.090
heaving breasts as far as the eye can see

40:40.049 --> 40:42.799
and me with my wizened, yet still

40:46.854 --> 40:50.854
appreciated by traditional
Earth custom titties,

40:52.293 --> 40:56.136
in the audience, waiting to meet that

40:56.138 --> 40:57.721
nefarious director.

40:59.527 --> 41:03.194
Our eyes locked from
across the crowded lot.

41:05.924 --> 41:07.341
I approached him.

41:08.739 --> 41:11.355
I was very afraid, you see.

41:11.357 --> 41:13.855
You see, I hadn't had any of that

41:13.857 --> 41:16.690
delicious breast milk yet that day

41:18.119 --> 41:21.893
and I said, no, I don't
need that courage right now,

41:21.895 --> 41:22.728
I see him.

41:26.258 --> 41:29.675
We started a passionate, passionate tryst

41:30.658 --> 41:33.658
and by tryst I mean planning murders

41:34.861 --> 41:36.778
while eating Triscuits.

41:37.915 --> 41:40.832
But then, in the manner of all men,

41:45.954 --> 41:50.121
he left me for a Wheat Thin.

41:51.450 --> 41:52.283
Oh, oh.

41:53.264 --> 41:55.126
I was irate, naturally,
as you can imagine.

41:55.128 --> 41:56.763
Of course, of course.

41:56.765 --> 41:57.919
What did you do?

41:57.921 --> 42:00.841
Oh, I went back to the
lot the very next day

42:00.843 --> 42:04.176
and I said, where is that Andrew Shearer

42:05.043 --> 42:07.421
and they said, we don't know
what you're talking about,

42:07.423 --> 42:08.704
please leave.

42:08.706 --> 42:11.200
Well, I burned down the whole studio

42:11.202 --> 42:14.004
and it wasn't until later I realized

42:14.006 --> 42:17.313
I burnt down the Fox lot
and not the Paramount lot.

42:17.315 --> 42:18.146
That's a common mistake, yes.

42:18.148 --> 42:19.171
Yes, it was very sad.

42:19.173 --> 42:20.350
Common mistake, yes.

42:20.352 --> 42:23.710
So, I was no longer allowed
to be a part of that movie.

42:23.712 --> 42:24.790
Oh.

42:24.792 --> 42:27.152
Thank you so much for
sharing Grand Muff Tits.

42:27.154 --> 42:29.149
Of course, thank you
for being here for me.

42:29.151 --> 42:31.266
Oh, you're welcome, you're welcome,

42:31.268 --> 42:32.518
your aged self.

42:34.169 --> 42:35.591
You're beautiful and old.

42:35.593 --> 42:37.292
Oh, thank you.

42:37.294 --> 42:40.752
Why don't you introduce
the next set of films?

42:40.754 --> 42:41.992
Well,

42:41.994 --> 42:45.661
you all watching are
in for a special treat.

42:47.679 --> 42:51.846
We are going to get some
actual human Earth people

42:53.275 --> 42:57.275
depictions of the real
life in the 21st century.

42:58.517 --> 43:02.074
You won't believe what they get up to,

43:02.076 --> 43:03.716
number seven's a shocker.

43:39.353 --> 43:41.936
I'm in the basement.

48:01.795 --> 48:03.563
And then I just cut off his head.

48:03.565 --> 48:07.522
Oh, you know I love murder!

48:07.524 --> 48:08.625
I know, I know.

48:08.627 --> 48:11.311
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Zee Zee Poof

48:11.313 --> 48:14.088
and we have had a wonderful time with

48:14.090 --> 48:17.893
the Grand Muff Tit, it has been an honor,

48:17.895 --> 48:21.908
a true honor for your aged
face to grace our presence.

48:21.910 --> 48:23.910
The honor is all mine.

48:24.873 --> 48:29.040
To be here with you, one of
my closest bosom buddies,

48:32.570 --> 48:35.570
in front of all of you, the viewers.

48:37.025 --> 48:39.349
I just, I couldn't be happier

48:39.351 --> 48:41.247
and I hope you'll have me here again soon.

48:41.249 --> 48:43.168
Oh, anytime, anytime,

48:43.170 --> 48:44.707
we'd love to and coming up next we have

48:44.709 --> 48:46.319
Beryl Peep here now, yay.

48:53.327 --> 48:56.327
Yeah, you're looking rather young.

48:57.327 --> 48:58.994
Beryl Peep, hello.

49:00.120 --> 49:01.180
Hello, dear.

49:01.182 --> 49:04.079
How are you, it's good to see you.

49:04.081 --> 49:06.910
Thank you, thank you so much.

49:06.912 --> 49:09.188
I am loving this exotic outfit,

49:09.190 --> 49:10.689
can you tell us about it?

49:10.691 --> 49:11.608
Oh, this.

49:12.589 --> 49:13.748
Yes.

49:13.750 --> 49:17.069
When I was doing research for my

49:17.071 --> 49:21.238
highly critically acclaimed
turn in Space Boobs In Space,

49:25.386 --> 49:29.491
I did research on that period
of time in Earth history.

49:29.493 --> 49:31.065
The 1990s, yes.

49:31.067 --> 49:32.150
Reagan years.

49:33.321 --> 49:36.742
And I learned that Earth humans,

49:36.744 --> 49:40.911
they would wear dead animals
draped across their bodies,

49:42.984 --> 49:44.158
it was very popular.

49:44.160 --> 49:45.246
Oh, goodness,

49:45.248 --> 49:46.605
well, did you kill this thing?

49:46.607 --> 49:49.024
No, I didn't kill this one.

49:50.026 --> 49:51.943
This is a vintage piece

49:52.806 --> 49:55.701
but the humans, they raise the animals,

49:55.703 --> 49:58.621
it was a special breeding program

49:58.623 --> 50:02.963
and they were raised to
have depression issues

50:02.965 --> 50:05.546
and they would kill themselves.

50:05.548 --> 50:07.556
Oh, I love all of this, it's beautiful.

50:07.558 --> 50:09.023
Thank you, thank you.

50:09.025 --> 50:13.261
So we actually are about
to watch some human films,

50:13.263 --> 50:16.465
some human sort of
documentary educational films

50:16.467 --> 50:17.563
that humans make...

50:17.565 --> 50:18.396
About nature?

50:18.398 --> 50:20.695
Yes, yes, for other
humans to learn about

50:20.697 --> 50:21.858
the place where they live.

50:21.860 --> 50:24.558
I find Earth nature,
just, it's fascinating.

50:24.560 --> 50:25.939
We should really,

50:25.941 --> 50:28.797
I mean, the same planet that produced

50:28.799 --> 50:30.457
the milk from the titty.

50:30.459 --> 50:32.098
Oh, milk from the titty.

50:32.100 --> 50:33.839
We really, we owe it to ourselves to

50:33.841 --> 50:38.698
learn as much as possible
about their natural habitat.

50:38.700 --> 50:40.434
Yes, habitat.

50:40.436 --> 50:41.678
Let's go to the film.

50:42.716 --> 50:44.540
Hi, I'm Andrew and I
make really cheap movies.

50:44.542 --> 50:47.617
I am very interested in
the idea of real monsters

50:47.619 --> 50:49.759
because then I don't have to come up

50:49.761 --> 50:51.721
with the makeup for it.

50:51.723 --> 50:53.857
They've already got it on
'cause they're monsters.

50:53.859 --> 50:56.299
My only problem really is that,

50:56.301 --> 50:57.781
will they kill me

50:57.783 --> 51:00.620
and all I've heard about
the Sandy Creek Mud Monster

51:00.622 --> 51:02.705
is that she kills people.

51:05.643 --> 51:07.017
I kind of need

51:07.019 --> 51:11.186
to know if there's a female
swamp monster around here,

51:13.341 --> 51:14.720
'cause if there is,

51:14.722 --> 51:18.018
I don't want somebody
else filming her first.

51:18.020 --> 51:19.675
I should be the one to do it.

51:19.677 --> 51:22.580
I mean, that makes total sense.

51:22.582 --> 51:24.249
So, I'm on my way to

51:25.613 --> 51:27.578
the Sandy Creek Nature Center

51:27.580 --> 51:30.798
and I'm gonna go way off the beaten path,

51:30.800 --> 51:33.157
gonna go really far,

51:33.159 --> 51:35.078
back to the parts where

51:35.080 --> 51:37.400
it's a little dicey and no one ever goes

51:37.402 --> 51:40.460
because if she's gonna be living somewhere

51:40.462 --> 51:44.629
and everybody with their
phones and all that stuff,

51:45.901 --> 51:47.820
and never gotten a picture of her,

51:47.822 --> 51:50.258
there's gotta be a reason for it.

51:50.260 --> 51:52.279
It's gotta be a place where

51:52.281 --> 51:55.785
it's not safe to bring
your beard and you PBR,

51:55.787 --> 51:57.381
so that's where I'm going.

52:24.742 --> 52:25.573
How you doing?

52:25.575 --> 52:27.056
I'm doing great.

52:27.058 --> 52:28.032
How y'all doing?

52:28.034 --> 52:30.133
Oh, we're good, you know,

just thought we'd come and say hey,

52:31.989 --> 52:34.614
find out if you were real,
et cetera, et cetera.

52:34.616 --> 52:36.710
That is so refreshing because usually

52:36.712 --> 52:39.827
it's an opposite, usually
I'm dealing with people,

52:39.829 --> 52:43.006
you know, running, screaming.

52:43.008 --> 52:44.863
You know, that's okay, that's who I am

52:44.865 --> 52:46.706
and I just want other people to know that.

52:46.708 --> 52:49.625
I want other people to realize what

52:50.523 --> 52:52.488
it is to be a mud monster.

52:52.490 --> 52:54.171
Well, I heard that

52:54.173 --> 52:56.830
you like to rip arms
off, suck out eyeballs,

52:56.832 --> 52:59.291
that kind of thing but so far, so good.

52:59.293 --> 53:01.863
Basically, everything that you see here

53:01.865 --> 53:04.282
is couture, I made it myself.

53:05.151 --> 53:07.163
Everything that you see me wearing,

53:07.165 --> 53:09.073
I found here in the woods.

53:09.075 --> 53:10.669
It's actually three bags,

53:10.671 --> 53:13.338
is that I braided and used some,

53:14.387 --> 53:17.071
you know, another campers shoelaces.

53:17.073 --> 53:18.320
So are those
people still alive or

53:18.322 --> 53:19.853
how's that working?

53:19.855 --> 53:22.767
Um, I mean, define alive.

53:22.769 --> 53:24.793
Now they're included
in fashion, which is way

53:24.795 --> 53:26.453
more important than
just a mortal existence.

53:26.455 --> 53:27.527
Fashion is forever.

53:27.529 --> 53:28.552
Certainly.

53:28.554 --> 53:29.634
Fashion is forever.

53:29.636 --> 53:31.719
So, uh, I was camping and

53:33.276 --> 53:36.356
you wouldn't know it now, but
I was a bit of a princess,

53:36.358 --> 53:37.275
wasn't into

53:39.660 --> 53:43.827
being in the woods, I was a bit
of a, you know, city owl and

53:48.096 --> 53:51.670
well, I was out there camping and you see,

53:51.672 --> 53:55.954
I heard a sound and I
went to investigate and

53:55.956 --> 53:59.623
I saw the mud monster
and I was attacked but

54:01.337 --> 54:02.254
not killed.

54:03.214 --> 54:05.399
So, uh, he kind of retired.

54:05.401 --> 54:07.071
He just left the woods.

54:07.073 --> 54:08.516
He went to Reno.

54:08.518 --> 54:11.436
Since I was already, you know, afflicted,

54:11.438 --> 54:13.658
I decided to go with it.

54:13.660 --> 54:16.898
I like being in the woods, you know and

54:16.900 --> 54:20.817
sometimes I think the
call of Broadway might be

54:21.875 --> 54:24.857
somewhere in my future but

54:24.859 --> 54:26.836
you never know, you know?

54:26.838 --> 54:28.334
Mud monster one day.

54:28.336 --> 54:29.338
Yeah, stranger
things have happened.

54:29.340 --> 54:30.933
Yeah, the internet.

54:30.935 --> 54:32.880
Is this where you live?

54:32.882 --> 54:35.498
This is my place, this
is where I keep my things.

54:35.500 --> 54:37.837
You know, all my wearable art.

54:37.839 --> 54:38.945
That's nice,
where'd you get that,

54:38.947 --> 54:39.778
do you remember?

54:39.780 --> 54:41.545
I think it was a sorority group.

54:41.547 --> 54:43.205
They ran so fast, I didn't get the chance

54:43.207 --> 54:44.585
to find out, I guess.

54:44.587 --> 54:46.003
I remember
them, 'cause it was like,

54:46.005 --> 54:47.925
they had trouble
identifying them as missing

54:47.927 --> 54:49.724
because they all looked the same.

54:49.726 --> 54:51.547
I mean, it doesn't
get any finer than this,

54:51.549 --> 54:52.604

Exactly.

Yeah, yeah,
well, where do people go

54:55.752 --> 54:57.787
when they wanna get away, anyway?

54:57.789 --> 54:58.846

Yes?

56:00.931 --> 56:02.830
I did a lot of research on human culture

56:02.832 --> 56:06.474
and Earth history and I
found some interesting things

56:06.476 --> 56:09.976
about them, like it is a little known fact

56:11.300 --> 56:15.050
that humans are obsessed
with their own anus.

56:16.551 --> 56:17.770
Their anus?

56:17.772 --> 56:19.390
Yes.

56:19.392 --> 56:21.729
They, at that point in history,

56:21.731 --> 56:25.793
they took all these
photographs of their buttocks

56:25.795 --> 56:29.065
which is where the human anus is located.

56:29.067 --> 56:32.556
The anus is in their buttocks?

56:32.558 --> 56:34.094
How do they sit on the chairs?

56:34.096 --> 56:35.301
I know.

56:35.303 --> 56:37.501
Oh, Shearer was sitting
there with his anus,

56:37.503 --> 56:38.726
you realize this?

56:38.728 --> 56:40.155
Yes.

56:40.157 --> 56:42.016
Oh, horrifying, horrifying.

56:42.018 --> 56:42.849
It's very distasteful.

56:42.851 --> 56:44.580
It's very distasteful.

56:44.582 --> 56:47.358
We're better not thinking about it.

56:47.360 --> 56:49.462
So humans, at this point in history

56:49.464 --> 56:53.682
were obsessed with their
own anus and knowing that

56:53.684 --> 56:55.934
gave me an understanding of

56:56.883 --> 56:59.818
how the Queen would have felt

56:59.820 --> 57:03.634
interacting with these primitive humans

57:03.636 --> 57:06.886
who were so stupid and so obsessed with

57:08.145 --> 57:10.499
their own defecation.

57:10.501 --> 57:13.013
Have you had any sort of

57:13.015 --> 57:16.438
strange interactions with the illustrious

57:16.440 --> 57:18.499

57:18.501 --> 57:23.276

Queen you have portrayed?

57:23.278 --> 57:25.778
I really feel very fortunate

57:26.699 --> 57:29.866
that Grand Muff and I have always had,

57:31.481 --> 57:35.258
I feel a cordial relationship, really.

57:35.260 --> 57:36.432

57:48.122 --> 57:48.955
Ah, yes.

57:50.920 --> 57:52.253

should be kept professional,

58:02.484 --> 58:03.901
you know, I just,

58:04.899 --> 58:07.538

own approach, you know.

58:10.276 --> 58:11.920

58:11.922 --> 58:15.246
I don't bring matches to set.

58:15.248 --> 58:18.282
I think that has been instrumental

58:18.284 --> 58:21.540

58:45.097 --> 58:46.854
I just wanted to know if you could tell us

58:46.856 --> 58:51.010
why you are participated
in the movie about breasts

58:51.012 --> 58:53.750
when you could be possibly,
maybe, a political statement

58:53.752 --> 58:57.085
or a social statement or save the whale,

58:57.972 --> 58:59.613
why you are doing the movie instead?

58:59.615 --> 59:02.428
Why can't I save the whale
and play with the boobs?

59:02.430 --> 59:05.871

your character motivation

59:05.873 --> 59:08.529

59:38.713 --> 59:41.991

59:41.993 --> 59:44.567
Very many, yes, very many scandal.

You do not want to say

59:58.610 --> 59:59.938
or are you afraid of them?

59:59.940 --> 01:00:01.569
I am forbidden.

01:00:01.571 --> 01:00:02.970
Ms. Jenny Haniver,

01:00:02.972 --> 01:00:04.464
will you talk to the Foreign Press

01:00:04.466 --> 01:00:07.329
about your work in the
Space Boob From Space

01:00:07.331 --> 01:00:09.737
and how do it relate to the plight of

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.822
the aboriginal in Brazil?

01:00:14.876 --> 01:00:16.956
I don't know what you said, mate.

01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:18.176
I'm high as a kite right now.

01:00:18.178 --> 01:00:19.627
Right, right, right,

01:00:19.629 --> 01:00:22.768
what is your favorite pizza toppings?

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:23.603
Uh.

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:26.285
Milk, milk.

01:00:26.287 --> 01:00:27.783
Milk, yeah, milk.

01:00:27.785 --> 01:00:30.560
How do you
feel about the baby cow and

01:00:30.562 --> 01:00:33.147
how the milk is only for him and not

01:00:33.149 --> 01:00:35.405
for the human consumptions?

01:00:35.407 --> 01:00:38.592
You know, I never really
thought it before but

01:00:38.594 --> 01:00:40.368
it's kind of fucked up, eh?

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.964
Do you know
Steve Irwin per personal

01:00:42.966 --> 01:00:45.558
and how do you feel he, Paul Hogan

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.727
was affected by his untimely passings?

01:00:50.204 --> 01:00:52.565
What is your favorite color?

01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:56.106
We have report that Coquette
Du Jour have murdered

01:00:56.108 --> 01:00:58.314
Tittiana Sprinkle or Tittiana Sprinkle

01:00:58.316 --> 01:01:01.654
have murdered Coquette Du
Jour in the dressing room.

01:01:01.656 --> 01:01:03.471
Have you heard about,
can you confirm these

01:01:03.473 --> 01:01:04.390
for Brazil?

01:01:05.894 --> 01:01:08.492
I thought that was a dream I had.

01:01:09.643 --> 01:01:11.845
Ladies and gentlemen, I am Zee Zee Poof

01:01:11.847 --> 01:01:16.407
and we are here with the
late actress Beryl Peep.

01:01:16.409 --> 01:01:18.949
Now Mrs. Peep, we have
just seen some of your

01:01:18.951 --> 01:01:21.607
illustrious cast mates
talking about the film.

01:01:21.609 --> 01:01:23.745
It was a joy to work with, really,

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:25.265
almost all of them.

01:01:25.267 --> 01:01:26.098
I can tell.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.150
Now we are going to go
straight to the next film

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:30.267
because it is one of my personal favorites

01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:32.963
in which you play a dead human,

01:01:32.965 --> 01:01:35.209
which is just fascinating.

01:01:35.211 --> 01:01:37.450
It was a lot of work, you know.

01:01:37.452 --> 01:01:40.589
The extensive prosthetic make-up

01:01:40.591 --> 01:01:42.169
that had to be put on me.

01:01:42.171 --> 01:01:43.353
Oh.

01:01:43.355 --> 01:01:44.765
Really took a long time,

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:47.311
they had to cover my age spots,

01:01:47.313 --> 01:01:48.671
which was very uncomfortable.

01:01:48.673 --> 01:01:50.354
I don't know that I could do that.

01:01:50.356 --> 01:01:53.094
It felt odd to be so ugly, you know,

01:01:53.096 --> 01:01:55.091
and to look so human.

01:01:55.093 --> 01:01:56.911
They're so strange looking.

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.370
They're very ugly.

01:01:58.372 --> 01:02:00.774
What sort of method
did you have to go into

01:02:00.776 --> 01:02:02.150
to play a dead human,

01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:05.250
did you think about your
anus the entire time?

01:02:05.252 --> 01:02:07.531
Well, I talked to the other
humans because, you know,

01:02:07.533 --> 01:02:10.411
some of the roles were
played by actual humans.

01:02:10.413 --> 01:02:12.059
Yes, had they been dead before?

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:15.014
I talked to the other humans on set

01:02:15.016 --> 01:02:18.009
and they told me that the dead humans

01:02:18.011 --> 01:02:20.564
don't utilize their anus.

01:02:20.566 --> 01:02:21.688
At all?

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:22.521
No.

01:02:22.523 --> 01:02:23.354
How bizarre.

01:02:23.356 --> 01:02:25.475
So they just stop when they die

01:02:25.477 --> 01:02:26.792
and they just, odd.

01:02:26.794 --> 01:02:30.995
So it was very strange because I had to

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:34.497
both be this human character who remembers

01:02:35.339 --> 01:02:38.006
being obsessed with my own anus.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.568
So coming up next.

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:42.814
Yes, this film that I play in.

01:02:42.816 --> 01:02:43.894
Can you give us a little bit

01:02:43.896 --> 01:02:45.353
of an introduction?

01:02:45.355 --> 01:02:49.699
Well, I felt like this was a,

01:02:49.701 --> 01:02:52.284
a deeply emotional role for me,

01:02:53.137 --> 01:02:56.421
being able to get in touch with, you know,

01:02:56.423 --> 01:02:58.506
like my inner, my inner...

01:03:00.817 --> 01:03:01.959
Boobs.

01:03:01.961 --> 01:03:03.711
Dead human, so, um.

01:03:05.206 --> 01:03:07.863
Can they go back and forth?

01:03:07.865 --> 01:03:09.204
Can dead humans come back?

01:03:09.206 --> 01:03:11.478
No, they just stay that way.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.540
They're very strange.

01:03:13.542 --> 01:03:14.862
That's so weird.

01:03:14.864 --> 01:03:15.695
Yeah.

01:03:15.697 --> 01:03:16.981
Alright, well, let's go to the film,

01:03:16.983 --> 01:03:18.480
we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.

01:03:41.763 --> 01:03:43.267
Okay so,

01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:46.203
I wanna get serious for a minute.

01:03:46.205 --> 01:03:48.648
Everything's fine, but I have to.

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:51.983
Don't do that, you'll ruin everything.

01:03:53.509 --> 01:03:55.684
I know I'm not the best at,

01:03:55.686 --> 01:03:59.103
at telling you how I feel sometimes, but,

01:04:00.707 --> 01:04:02.383
you're making it take longer...

01:04:02.385 --> 01:04:05.385
Huh, oh.

01:04:06.321 --> 01:04:08.738
I wanna give you something.

01:04:11.365 --> 01:04:13.865
It belonged to my grandmother.

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:17.406
She was my best friend and

01:04:17.408 --> 01:04:19.620
whenever I forget what true love is like

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:22.205
I just look at it and remember.

01:04:23.869 --> 01:04:26.085
I, no, oh my god, no, I can't take that.

01:04:26.087 --> 01:04:27.083
That's too much.

01:04:27.085 --> 01:04:28.584
You have to.

01:04:28.586 --> 01:04:30.086
It's safe with you

01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:36.550
and you're safe with me.

01:04:39.908 --> 01:04:43.825
Now when you look at it
you'll know every time.

01:04:49.667 --> 01:04:51.464
No, I think a few months
is perfect timing,

01:04:51.466 --> 01:04:55.657
it wasn't like creepy or like,
desperate, you know, but,

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:58.900
it was like something out of
a movie, it was really sweet,

01:04:58.902 --> 01:05:01.304
only, you know, it
wasn't cheesy or anything

01:05:01.306 --> 01:05:04.639
because it was happening to me.

01:05:04.641 --> 01:05:06.702
Oh, um, well, it's gorgeous.

01:05:06.704 --> 01:05:11.181
I sorta don't wanna take it off.

01:05:11.183 --> 01:05:14.016
Um, no, I can't tomorrow actually,

01:05:14.866 --> 01:05:17.116
he's cooking me dinner, so.

01:05:19.022 --> 01:05:21.439
Oh, you'll find somebody else

01:05:22.337 --> 01:05:25.365
to go out with and be jealous
of, don't worry about it,

01:05:25.367 --> 01:05:26.200
bye.

01:05:47.984 --> 01:05:49.633
Thank you for doing this and

01:05:49.635 --> 01:05:51.459
especially for telling me no

01:05:51.461 --> 01:05:53.311
when I asked if I could help.

01:05:53.313 --> 01:05:55.540
That's okay, I know you hate cooking.

01:05:55.542 --> 01:05:57.699
I do feel sorta guilty but

01:05:57.701 --> 01:06:01.060
I would feel worse
burning your house down.

01:06:01.062 --> 01:06:03.195
Tell you what, you finish that

01:06:03.197 --> 01:06:04.979
while I go get the good dishes.

01:06:04.981 --> 01:06:06.360
And I can set the table if you trust

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:08.241
me with those.

01:06:08.243 --> 01:06:09.243
We'll see.

01:06:20.399 --> 01:06:24.232
So, who's this hot
mama in the picture here?

01:06:27.022 --> 01:06:27.855
Really?

01:06:30.122 --> 01:06:32.138
Well, she's got on your
grandmother's ring,

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.797
so you can't say she's no one.

01:06:34.799 --> 01:06:36.113
No,

01:06:36.115 --> 01:06:38.712
she was definitely somebody,

01:06:38.714 --> 01:06:39.547
was.

01:06:40.902 --> 01:06:44.936
Oh, come on, we never
talk about your exes.

01:06:44.938 --> 01:06:48.998
I'll trade you stories,
I got a couple good ones.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.681
I do too,

01:06:50.683 --> 01:06:53.076
just not about her.

01:06:53.078 --> 01:06:56.039
Ooh, well now you have to.

01:06:56.041 --> 01:06:57.578
Nah.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.058
There was this one girl...

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:00.955
Who is not in this picture and

01:07:00.957 --> 01:07:02.878
who I don't care about.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.519
The girl in the picture died.

01:07:07.303 --> 01:07:08.303
Oh my god.

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:11.118
I-I'm sorry.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.520
It's okay.

01:07:12.522 --> 01:07:14.318
I'm not weird about it.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.740
We weren't together that long,

01:07:16.742 --> 01:07:20.075
we broke up long before it happened, so.

01:07:21.618 --> 01:07:23.741
That's horrible,

01:07:23.743 --> 01:07:26.898
I didn't realize, I
wouldn't have said anything.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.099
It's really okay.

01:07:29.101 --> 01:07:32.934
She gave me the ring
back before we split, so.

01:07:35.178 --> 01:07:38.780
None of my exes ever really
liked talking about exes

01:07:38.782 --> 01:07:40.860
so I guess I just got into the habit of

01:07:40.862 --> 01:07:41.945
not doing so.

01:07:42.935 --> 01:07:45.097
That's probably a good habit.

01:07:45.099 --> 01:07:47.756
The present is way more important.

01:07:47.758 --> 01:07:49.857
I'd rather talk about you.

01:07:49.859 --> 01:07:51.776
Well, we can do that.

01:08:09.424 --> 01:08:10.257
Ow.

01:08:25.237 --> 01:08:26.715
Oh, I know who you are.

01:08:26.716 --> 01:08:28.134
I, fuck, go away.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.453
Oh my god, please go away.

01:08:31.455 --> 01:08:33.995
I don't even know if I love him yet,

01:08:33.997 --> 01:08:36.410
I just, I think I might but,

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:39.314
you know what, you can
have him, just have him,

01:08:39.316 --> 01:08:41.710
just, you can't have him, you're dead,

01:08:41.712 --> 01:08:44.011
what am I saying?

01:08:49.466 --> 01:08:52.371
I don't know what you want.

01:08:52.372 --> 01:08:54.622
Just go away, just go away.

01:09:14.231 --> 01:09:15.064
Oh.

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:19.491
What are you doing way over here,

01:09:19.493 --> 01:09:22.028
tired of our usual spot?

01:09:22.029 --> 01:09:23.752
There's just too many people, you know?

01:09:23.754 --> 01:09:25.648
I wanted a little more privacy.

01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:27.184
Well, you better be careful because

01:09:27.185 --> 01:09:30.519
privacy can lead to sexy really quickly,

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:33.310
sexy picnic.

01:09:37.117 --> 01:09:39.048
I really should have
told you about Candice.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:40.966
Well, at some point you
were bound to find out

01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:44.395
how nosy I am.

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:48.894
Things didn't work
out for me and Candice

01:09:48.895 --> 01:09:51.372
for the same reason they never work out.

01:09:51.374 --> 01:09:53.875
I just need you to trust me

01:09:53.877 --> 01:09:57.572
and if you need to know
everything, I'll tell you

01:09:57.574 --> 01:09:59.349
and you're right,

01:09:59.351 --> 01:10:00.434
you are nosy.

01:10:01.899 --> 01:10:03.993
So if you wanna know how she died,

01:10:03.995 --> 01:10:06.078
I'll tell you right here.

01:10:07.135 --> 01:10:09.052
Right here it happened.

01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:11.647
Right here.

01:10:57.819 --> 01:10:59.471
And action, Kate!

01:10:59.473 --> 01:11:02.525
I know who you are and I'm not okay

01:11:02.527 --> 01:11:04.452
with you being here

01:11:04.454 --> 01:11:06.652
and you need to go and you can have him

01:11:06.654 --> 01:11:08.875
but maybe not today,
maybe sometime next week

01:11:08.877 --> 01:11:12.770
but you're a ghost, so
really can't have him at all.

01:11:12.772 --> 01:11:14.756
Mother wanted me to come down in a kimono,

01:11:14.758 --> 01:11:18.610
we had an awful fight.

01:11:20.812 --> 01:11:22.451
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:11:22.453 --> 01:11:26.036
hope you enjoyed that
very interesting film

01:11:26.888 --> 01:11:30.505
that I love, I love, I
watch it all the time.

01:11:30.507 --> 01:11:34.963
You really encompass all
the nuance of a dead human.

01:11:34.965 --> 01:11:36.606
Oh, thank you.

01:11:36.608 --> 01:11:37.784
Oh, stop.

01:11:37.786 --> 01:11:41.326
It's wonderful to see,
it's emotional and moving

01:11:41.328 --> 01:11:44.785
and just, you capture
their ugliness so well.

01:11:44.787 --> 01:11:46.562
You're too kind.

01:11:46.564 --> 01:11:49.122
So, would you like to introduce

01:11:49.124 --> 01:11:52.802
this film that I heard was
also a favorite of yours

01:11:52.804 --> 01:11:53.963
and was instrumental.

01:11:53.965 --> 01:11:56.477
I did watch this human film
when I was doing research

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:58.363
for playing a human.

01:11:58.365 --> 01:11:59.198
Yes.

01:12:01.368 --> 01:12:05.368
This film, I felt was,
for me and my research,

01:12:06.261 --> 01:12:08.499
was something of a turning point

01:12:08.501 --> 01:12:12.251
in really seeing that
all parts of human life

01:12:13.945 --> 01:12:17.445
related back to the buttocks and the anus.

01:12:18.762 --> 01:12:19.679
Yes, yes.

01:12:20.701 --> 01:12:23.643
And so, I felt like
I could really see that

01:12:23.645 --> 01:12:26.824
coming through in this particular picture.

01:12:26.826 --> 01:12:28.777
You saw the anus coming through.

01:12:28.779 --> 01:12:31.323
So, I mean, but it
was really enlightening

01:12:31.325 --> 01:12:34.058
and it helped give greater insight

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.997
into the way that humans really work

01:12:36.999 --> 01:12:38.440
when interacting with them.

01:12:38.442 --> 01:12:41.177
That is a fascinating, fascinating...

01:12:41.179 --> 01:12:42.478
I think it's important.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.456
Perspective on human culture.

01:12:43.458 --> 01:12:44.378
I think it's important.

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.211
Let's see it.

01:13:32.986 --> 01:13:34.372
He's been watching us,

01:13:34.374 --> 01:13:36.595
I told you they was watching us.

01:13:36.597 --> 01:13:39.793
So, it does not mean
that they are vampires.

01:13:39.795 --> 01:13:41.674
Now the hell it don't.

01:13:41.676 --> 01:13:43.494
They did the same thing to my cousin Angie

01:13:43.496 --> 01:13:44.797
a couple weeks ago.

01:13:44.799 --> 01:13:46.829
These bitches stayed out at
the club late all night long

01:13:46.831 --> 01:13:48.437
and then they gotta go
steal somebody's car

01:13:48.439 --> 01:13:49.892
so then they can get home in the morning

01:13:49.894 --> 01:13:51.078
before the sun come up.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.524
So they steal cars, that does not

01:13:52.526 --> 01:13:53.758
mean that they are vampires.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.177
Uh, yeah it do.

01:13:57.785 --> 01:13:59.844
Alright look, I told you we could go home

01:13:59.846 --> 01:14:01.521
if you were too scared.

01:14:01.523 --> 01:14:04.202
I am afraid of nothing,

01:14:04.204 --> 01:14:06.621
plus, my phone is in the car.

01:14:07.601 --> 01:14:09.480
Well, we should go do this real quick

01:14:09.482 --> 01:14:12.149
before we burn up too, let's go.

01:14:41.705 --> 01:14:42.944
They got the keys

01:14:42.946 --> 01:14:44.006
and your phone is gone too.

01:14:50.705 --> 01:14:53.788
Well, it looks like we're going in.

01:14:55.209 --> 01:14:56.292
Okay, okay.

01:14:57.891 --> 01:14:58.986
Let's do this.

01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:05.685
Wait.

01:15:05.687 --> 01:15:07.804
What is your brilliant plan?

01:15:07.806 --> 01:15:09.745
I don't know,

01:15:09.747 --> 01:15:11.684
drink a bunch of holy water
and I'll piss in their face,

01:15:11.686 --> 01:15:12.547
man, I don't know, I thought the keys

01:15:12.549 --> 01:15:13.952
would be in the car.

01:15:13.954 --> 01:15:15.211
Okay.

01:15:15.213 --> 01:15:16.044
Okay.

01:15:16.046 --> 01:15:19.379
Okay.

01:15:20.594 --> 01:15:21.515
Okay, let's go.

01:15:32.593 --> 01:15:33.426
Yeah.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:39.075
Yes?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.577
If you are through playing around

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:43.156
we would like our car back.

01:15:43.158 --> 01:15:44.875
Yeah and I drank a
whole bunch of holy water

01:15:44.877 --> 01:15:48.294
and I gotta real bad, know what I mean?

01:15:48.296 --> 01:15:49.617
Holy water?

01:15:49.619 --> 01:15:51.573
I know y'all some vampires too.

01:15:51.575 --> 01:15:53.394
All that dirt on your neck and stuff

01:15:53.396 --> 01:15:55.332
and if you don't quite playing around

01:15:55.334 --> 01:15:56.995
and give me my car keys,
I'm gonna come in there

01:15:56.997 --> 01:15:59.051
and I'll pee on everything,
I'm gonna kill everybody.

01:15:59.053 --> 01:16:03.073
Psss.

01:16:03.075 --> 01:16:04.408
Uh, follow me,

01:16:06.454 --> 01:16:07.954
ladies, follow me.

01:16:21.808 --> 01:16:23.129
Look man, I just want my car keys,

01:16:23.131 --> 01:16:23.962
we'll just wait right here.

01:16:23.964 --> 01:16:24.797
Uh-huh.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:27.749
Oh yes,

01:16:29.088 --> 01:16:29.921
the keys.

01:16:30.933 --> 01:16:33.474
The Master has the keys

01:16:33.476 --> 01:16:36.309
and the Master has your phone too.

01:16:40.206 --> 01:16:42.028
I told you they had my phone.

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:43.888
Alright yeah, well, you tell Master

01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:44.864
that we'll wait here and they can bring

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:46.849
the keys and the phone here.

01:16:46.851 --> 01:16:48.352
Um,

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:50.021
I must stay here but

01:16:51.175 --> 01:16:55.175
please go, the Master
wants much very, very much

01:16:56.051 --> 01:16:57.051
to meet you.

01:17:27.044 --> 01:17:29.225
Ugh, what's that smell?

01:17:29.227 --> 01:17:33.525
That is the smell of
cocaine pornographies.

01:17:33.527 --> 01:17:35.023
I don't know, I mean,

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:37.183
hookers fart dicks, vampires fart blood

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:40.068
and I know the difference
between dicks and blood.

01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:42.849
Thank you for telling me this.

01:17:54.659 --> 01:17:56.777
Don't look so frightened, my darlings,

01:17:56.779 --> 01:17:59.362
you are both far too beautiful.

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:02.000
I do not fear you,

01:18:02.002 --> 01:18:04.619
I do not feel fear your
collective titties.

01:18:04.621 --> 01:18:05.871
I fear nothing.

01:18:06.922 --> 01:18:08.741
That's not true, you're
afraid of skeletons.

01:18:08.743 --> 01:18:10.186
She's afraid of skeletons.

01:18:10.188 --> 01:18:13.710
Now, why would you
say that, that is a lie.

01:18:16.707 --> 01:18:19.866
You, my dear, have the
skeleton inside of you,

01:18:19.868 --> 01:18:21.701
right under your skin.

01:18:22.866 --> 01:18:25.033
Oh my dear, she's right.

01:18:26.225 --> 01:18:28.225
She's right, oh my dear.

01:18:29.356 --> 01:18:31.694
It's alright, everybody has one.

01:18:31.696 --> 01:18:32.675
Why would you say that?

01:18:32.677 --> 01:18:34.735
Because it's science.

01:18:34.737 --> 01:18:35.740
It's okay.

01:18:38.693 --> 01:18:39.526
Angie?

01:18:40.653 --> 01:18:43.130
Oh yes, your cousin,

01:18:43.132 --> 01:18:45.956
she came back for her car, just like you,

01:18:45.958 --> 01:18:48.076
but she decided to stay,

01:18:48.078 --> 01:18:48.911
lucky us.

01:18:51.195 --> 01:18:52.157
Angie.

01:18:54.336 --> 01:18:58.503
And she has told what a
fantastic dancer you are.

01:19:00.155 --> 01:19:01.405
This is true.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.776
All we ask is one dance

01:19:07.778 --> 01:19:11.261
and then we'll gladly return your keys.

01:19:11.263 --> 01:19:12.180
With you?

01:19:13.562 --> 01:19:16.660
You see, today is Ingrid's birthday.

01:19:16.662 --> 01:19:19.139
Last night, we went out to celebrate

01:19:19.141 --> 01:19:22.694
and had to make a quick
getaway to beat the sun.

01:19:22.696 --> 01:19:24.021
Why ain't y'all just fly home,

01:19:24.023 --> 01:19:27.673
why y'all got to steal people's cars?

01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:30.441
Miranda learned that one the hard way.

01:19:30.443 --> 01:19:32.461
Have you ever heard the sound a drunkin'

01:19:32.463 --> 01:19:34.539
bat makes when it burns it's chocha?

01:19:40.636 --> 01:19:41.469
Ew.

01:19:42.459 --> 01:19:44.257
Would you believe that poor Ingrid

01:19:44.259 --> 01:19:46.426
has never had a lap dance?

01:19:50.138 --> 01:19:50.971
Damn,

01:19:52.119 --> 01:19:55.878
they're talking now, put
out a chair and everything.

01:19:56.713 --> 01:19:58.856
What do you say?

01:19:58.858 --> 01:20:00.525
Where is my phone?

01:20:02.237 --> 01:20:03.878
Oh yes,

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.088
she quite likes these when they make

01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:07.673
with the vibrating.

01:20:17.714 --> 01:20:18.913
Darlings,

01:20:18.915 --> 01:20:20.875
sweet lovely darlings,

01:20:20.877 --> 01:20:22.576
shall we dance?

01:20:22.578 --> 01:20:26.640
And this is not a
cocaine pornography, eh?

01:20:26.642 --> 01:20:27.475
What?

01:21:44.685 --> 01:21:47.521
Meg, are you alright,
you don't look so good.

01:21:47.523 --> 01:21:49.197
I'm so hungry.

01:21:49.199 --> 01:21:52.018
Can we go to ze Waffle House?

01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:54.418
Meg, I'm about to pass out,

01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:58.260
been up all night and
all this vampire stuff.

01:21:58.262 --> 01:22:00.141
Meg, I got some beef jerky back there

01:22:00.143 --> 01:22:03.060
if you can't wait till we get home.

01:22:13.814 --> 01:22:15.414
Meg?

01:22:15.416 --> 01:22:16.249
Meg?

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:18.293
Meg?

01:23:06.969 --> 01:23:08.833
Good god, that's enough.

01:23:13.712 --> 01:23:15.016
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:23:15.018 --> 01:23:16.262
this is Zee Zee Poof,

01:23:16.264 --> 01:23:19.165
thank you so much for joining us tonight.

01:23:19.167 --> 01:23:22.058
These are my wonderful
guest, Ms. Beryl Peep,

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.893
big round of applause,

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:28.658
the honorable, the Grand Muff Tit

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:32.617
and the bizarre looking, Andrew Shearer,

01:23:32.619 --> 01:23:35.160
Earth man and director, yay.

01:23:35.162 --> 01:23:36.676
Thank you so much for joining us

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:37.960
in the cinema to give views

01:23:37.962 --> 01:23:40.020
of Space Boobs In Space.

01:23:40.022 --> 01:23:42.604
See you tomorrow, mwah.

01:25:20.695 --> 01:25:23.445
Oh, zerpluck, pardon me, hello,

01:25:25.177 --> 01:25:27.555
I didn't see you come in.

01:25:27.557 --> 01:25:30.807
I'm afraid your puny Earth vocal chords

01:25:32.201 --> 01:25:36.032
couldn't properly translate my name so

01:25:36.034 --> 01:25:39.284
I will grant you the ability to call me

01:25:40.937 --> 01:25:45.104
by my initials, but also
my title,

01:25:46.417 --> 01:25:48.084
I am Grand Muff Tit.

01:25:49.819 --> 01:25:52.516
Tonight I will be giving you

01:25:52.518 --> 01:25:55.018
the very inside scoop into the

01:25:58.155 --> 01:26:01.405
Iralanian state dinner we'll be having,

01:26:02.277 --> 01:26:05.444
and all the proper customs and history

01:26:08.912 --> 01:26:12.495
as we celebrate the
Tricentennial from when

01:26:13.608 --> 01:26:16.525
my species met you tiny, tiny folks

01:26:22.269 --> 01:26:26.436
on that pale blue dot we
call Earth.

01:26:28.207 --> 01:26:30.789
Now, allow me to break down for you

01:26:30.791 --> 01:26:33.791
the three basic of Iralanian customs

01:26:35.568 --> 01:26:37.735
we'll be going over today.

01:26:38.633 --> 01:26:41.389
Pleasing physical appearance,

01:26:41.391 --> 01:26:42.224
greetings

01:26:44.069 --> 01:26:46.402
and dining etiquette, which,

01:26:48.972 --> 01:26:53.139
there needs to be more
than just one desert spoon,

01:26:54.133 --> 01:26:56.550
at least three dessert spoons

01:26:58.074 --> 01:27:02.074
or else, why bother?

01:27:03.566 --> 01:27:07.399
Now, you might notice
upon my lovely cheekbone

01:27:10.088 --> 01:27:13.921
you will find some
wonderful emerald freckles.

01:27:18.212 --> 01:27:22.379
The Iralanians don't mind
them being called freckles,

01:27:24.403 --> 01:27:27.720
we prefer the term ginnyinni dots.

01:27:27.722 --> 01:27:31.555
You lowly humans might
have these weird little

01:27:33.717 --> 01:27:36.134
facial folds called wrinkles.

01:27:39.223 --> 01:27:41.306
I'm sorry to tell you but

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:45.890
these are disgusting.

01:27:46.779 --> 01:27:50.696
In order to alleviate
those unsightly wrinkles,

01:27:52.203 --> 01:27:54.286
what I might suggest is

01:27:54.288 --> 01:27:57.538
laying back and letting your saggy skin

01:27:59.181 --> 01:28:03.596
just kind of, let gravity
just kind of take it's,

01:28:03.598 --> 01:28:06.598
take it's hold and then
if you could get your skin

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:10.760
in the very back and just
pull it as taut as possible.

01:28:10.762 --> 01:28:13.657
I wouldn't say a staple gun

01:28:13.659 --> 01:28:15.758
but if that's what you have on hand,

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:20.518
don't let me stop you and
just go,

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.920
right down the neck to hold
that loose skin in place.

01:28:23.922 --> 01:28:28.089
Wrap a cosmetic, I believe
you call them, scarves,

01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:33.820
scarf around your neck
in some pleasing fashion,

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:37.675
perhaps like this, with my hair,

01:28:37.677 --> 01:28:39.941
but you don't have hair like this, I do,

01:28:39.943 --> 01:28:43.375
so you would have to find a scarf

01:28:43.377 --> 01:28:47.127
and now onto subject
two, personal greetings,

01:28:50.002 --> 01:28:52.553
because hello won't cut it

01:28:52.555 --> 01:28:55.888
and for this, I will have to bring on my

01:28:57.437 --> 01:29:01.604
production assistant,

01:29:04.758 --> 01:29:08.425
or as I affectionately
refer to her as Boob.

01:29:16.072 --> 01:29:18.322
With Boob here as my guest,

01:29:19.595 --> 01:29:23.345
we will now do the
official, proper state way

01:29:28.198 --> 01:29:30.448
of saying a Iralanian hello

01:29:31.461 --> 01:29:36.178
followed by an Iralanian goodbye

01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:38.535
and so, what you want to do is

01:29:38.537 --> 01:29:41.559
move your hands up to your titty

01:29:41.561 --> 01:29:45.989
forming titty fins, then
in an alternating motion,

01:29:45.991 --> 01:29:50.418
move your hands up,
down, up, down, up, down,

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:54.251
then lock eye contact
with the other Iralanian,

01:29:54.253 --> 01:29:57.111
up, down, up, down, move into position,

01:29:57.113 --> 01:29:59.154
up, down, up, down,

01:29:59.156 --> 01:30:01.575
approach the other Iralanian,

01:30:01.577 --> 01:30:04.827
up, down, up, down, make titty contact,

01:30:07.417 --> 01:30:10.555
up, down, up, down, now
shimmy, up, down, up, down,

01:30:10.557 --> 01:30:12.640
up, down, and then break.

01:30:13.814 --> 01:30:14.731
You did it.

01:30:15.596 --> 01:30:19.248
Now, onto the official state-sanctioned

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:20.667
Iralanian goodbye

01:30:23.855 --> 01:30:26.583
and for that, we will move our hands

01:30:26.585 --> 01:30:29.002
back up to titty fin position

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:34.124
and then quickly move them
to our buttocks, like so

01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:39.349
and this is mimicking our

01:30:39.351 --> 01:30:42.518
squid ancestors and just move this way

01:30:43.709 --> 01:30:45.495
until you're out the door.

01:30:45.497 --> 01:30:48.497
If you can ink, by all means, do so.

01:30:50.577 --> 01:30:54.160
Now, thank you, Production
Assistant, Boob,

01:30:55.238 --> 01:30:56.655
that will be all.

01:31:00.313 --> 01:31:03.634
Proper Iralanian dining etiquette.

01:31:03.636 --> 01:31:06.274
Yes, I have equipped with me

01:31:06.276 --> 01:31:08.859
the three proper dessert spoons

01:31:09.734 --> 01:31:13.708
because if you don't have
three, what's the point?

01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:17.742
You have to use one, um, nom, nom, nom,

01:31:17.744 --> 01:31:20.077
two, um, nom, nom, nom, nom,

01:31:21.575 --> 01:31:25.910
and three and you have
to hold them this way,

01:31:25.912 --> 01:31:28.493
slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp,
slurp, it's delicious.

01:31:28.495 --> 01:31:30.914
If you were to mix all of the traditional

01:31:30.916 --> 01:31:33.583
Iralanian desserts on one spoon,

01:31:34.457 --> 01:31:38.428
when combined with the
oxygen and the metal alloys

01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:42.513
in the spoon, you would
die a very painful death,

01:31:46.154 --> 01:31:49.571
very slowly over the course of 20 minutes

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:55.256
to 15 years, there's just no telling.

01:31:56.173 --> 01:31:57.971
I know I just dismissed her

01:31:57.973 --> 01:31:59.312
but I must bring her back again.

01:31:59.314 --> 01:32:01.814
My production assistant, Boob,

01:32:02.814 --> 01:32:06.981
will be coming to show us the
next proper dining etiquette.

01:32:09.351 --> 01:32:10.684
Thank you, Boob.

01:32:12.258 --> 01:32:13.818
Okay, goodbye.

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:16.153
Some lovely Earth titty milk

01:32:19.376 --> 01:32:21.916
and it will always be served

01:32:21.918 --> 01:32:24.935
in a glass like this and we will always

01:32:24.937 --> 01:32:27.187
take a sip of it like this.

01:32:30.414 --> 01:32:34.581
It's wonderful what our two
cultures can do when combined.

01:32:36.518 --> 01:32:39.974
We will remain looking fresh till death

01:32:39.976 --> 01:32:43.893
and you, when consuming
our lovely titty nectar

01:32:46.578 --> 01:32:50.517
will avoid the certain
death that all of us

01:32:50.519 --> 01:32:53.686
must receive by one more pleasant day,

01:32:55.274 --> 01:32:58.915
unless you eat all the
desserts on one spoon,

01:32:58.917 --> 01:33:02.058
then your death will last
anywhere from 20 minutes

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:03.227
to five years.

01:33:04.858 --> 01:33:09.025
Yes, we Iralanians will
drink your human titty milk

01:33:11.017 --> 01:33:13.615
because we need it to survive.

01:33:13.617 --> 01:33:17.173
If we don't, we'll turn back into squids

01:33:17.175 --> 01:33:21.342
and if I turn back into a
blessed squid one more time

01:33:23.399 --> 01:33:26.259
because of a trade embargo,

01:33:26.261 --> 01:33:30.675
I will go Cthulhu on all
of your major cities,

01:33:30.677 --> 01:33:33.260
towns and tourist destinations,

01:33:34.533 --> 01:33:36.668
specifically Panama City Beach,

01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:41.654
you know what you did,
PCB, you know what you did.

01:33:41.656 --> 01:33:44.736
If I may call my lovely
production assistant Boob

01:33:44.738 --> 01:33:47.988
here to reclaim this container from me,

01:33:49.154 --> 01:33:52.487
there's only so much of human titty milk

01:33:53.970 --> 01:33:56.955
I can take in one day,
despite being delicious

01:33:56.957 --> 01:34:00.051
and we do thank you for your trade.

01:34:00.053 --> 01:34:01.994
We do, I hate being a squid.

01:34:01.996 --> 01:34:03.794
It's just the worst.

01:34:03.796 --> 01:34:05.713
Alright, goodbye, Boob.

01:34:07.296 --> 01:34:11.572
And thank you
so much for joining us

01:34:11.574 --> 01:34:14.991
on this Earth Public Broadcasting System.

01:34:16.178 --> 01:34:20.211
Remember, they need your
donations to help us

01:34:20.213 --> 01:34:22.434
make this happen.

01:34:23.794 --> 01:34:25.812
Oh, and who could that be?

01:34:25.814 --> 01:34:28.390
Why, it's my boyfriend,

01:34:28.392 --> 01:34:32.559
Tom Cruise, Jr., Jr., Jr.,
Jr., the second.

01:34:37.854 --> 01:34:40.354
He's human, I'm so progressive

01:34:42.532 --> 01:34:44.932
and remember, the next time you're invited

01:34:44.934 --> 01:34:48.601
to an Iralanian state
function of some sort,

01:34:50.828 --> 01:34:54.129
I have taught you all the
basics you need to know

01:34:54.131 --> 01:34:57.464
to not look like the wrong kind of boob.

01:34:58.589 --> 01:34:59.422
Come.
