02:47.292 --> 02:48.860
Don't let anyone see.

03:10.981 --> 03:12.418
Let's do this, motherfucker.

03:16.086 --> 03:17.288
Come on.

03:44.348 --> 03:46.381
Oh, my God.

03:46.383 --> 03:48.885
This kid looks like he
suffers from Goblets.

03:48.887 --> 03:51.019
You can't say that.

03:51.021 --> 03:52.687
He was in a fire, you know.

03:52.689 --> 03:54.357
- Was he?
- Yes. He was in a...

03:54.359 --> 03:56.758
Well, the fire made him look really funny.

03:58.096 --> 04:01.898
This kid looks actually
spot on like a bagel.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.733
What are you talking about?

04:03.735 --> 04:06.135
This kid looks like an ice sculpture.

04:06.137 --> 04:08.504
She always reminded me of a backpack.

04:09.606 --> 04:11.006
Always.

04:11.008 --> 04:13.010
Jasmine Stamford. Would you?

04:13.411 --> 04:14.643
I think so.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.411
She would snap your dick off.

04:16.413 --> 04:17.415
What about her?

04:17.815 --> 04:18.981
Probably.

04:18.983 --> 04:20.850
She's blonde though, I don't really...

04:20.851 --> 04:22.250
You don't like blondes?

04:22.252 --> 04:24.019
Since when have you not liked blondes?

04:24.021 --> 04:25.587
I don't know.

04:25.589 --> 04:27.322
I don't know what I want anymore.

04:27.324 --> 04:28.457
Oh, wait a minute.

04:28.459 --> 04:31.793
I think we all agree that
Ms. Barron is hot as shit.

04:31.795 --> 04:33.094
Oh, Ms. Barron!

04:33.096 --> 04:34.796
She is fucking ridiculous.

04:34.798 --> 04:36.432
So fucking sexy.

04:36.434 --> 04:38.567
She should not be allowed to be a teacher.

04:38.569 --> 04:39.801
What about her?

04:39.803 --> 04:41.437
Mm.

04:41.439 --> 04:43.108
Allison Bannister.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.509
Obviously. Obviously.

04:46.511 --> 04:47.810
Anytime, anywhere.

04:47.812 --> 04:49.911
- Anywhere?
- Anywhere.

04:49.913 --> 04:52.380
Son, I'd do that shit for the
talent show, if that's what it took.

04:52.382 --> 04:53.515
That is disgusting.

04:53.517 --> 04:55.151
On stage, in front of everyone.

04:55.153 --> 04:57.222
Fuck yes! What, you wouldn't?

04:58.122 --> 05:00.089
- At the talent show?
- Yeah, whatever.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.658
No. I mean...

05:02.660 --> 05:04.360
Obviously... Okay.

05:04.362 --> 05:05.327
Allison is very cute.

05:05.329 --> 05:07.663
We know that, yeah? And she's very cool.

05:07.665 --> 05:10.599
But, like, we know her.
You can't be saying this...

05:10.601 --> 05:12.170
I don't know.

05:13.471 --> 05:14.904
I like her.

05:14.906 --> 05:16.906
Yeah, I like her too.

05:16.908 --> 05:19.408
Yeah. Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

05:19.410 --> 05:20.709
We actually know her.

05:20.711 --> 05:22.178
I actually hang out with her sometimes.

05:22.180 --> 05:23.812
It's just weird to be talking about her.

05:23.814 --> 05:25.082
Hang out with her?

05:27.552 --> 05:29.752
Yeah, like, in...

05:29.754 --> 05:31.654
Like group stuff, you know, in school.

05:31.656 --> 05:33.025
Like in history class or something.

05:34.492 --> 05:35.828
You got any drinks?

05:37.228 --> 05:39.398
Yeah, like, caffeine-free Coke.

05:40.230 --> 05:41.933
Well, then...

05:45.870 --> 05:47.769
Man, I hate the fucking winter.

05:47.771 --> 05:49.839
It's such a goddamn schlep to do anything.

05:49.841 --> 05:51.940
"Schlep"? What are you, a grandpa?

05:51.942 --> 05:54.043
The cold, it's debilitating.

05:54.045 --> 05:55.978
It's awful. It hurts my face.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.546
I don't know. Christmas rules.

05:57.548 --> 05:59.916
Anyway, it gets really
pretty when it snows.

05:59.918 --> 06:02.017
- "It gets really pretty"?
- Yeah, it does.

06:02.019 --> 06:03.819
All right, Mom. We're going out for a bit.

06:03.821 --> 06:05.521
I'll make sure to be home for dinner.

06:05.523 --> 06:06.688
I love you. Bye.

06:06.690 --> 06:07.592
Bye.

06:09.192 --> 06:10.394
Huh?

06:13.331 --> 06:15.764
You know when you're
in your maximum velocity

06:15.766 --> 06:17.699
and the gears just don't work anymore?

06:17.701 --> 06:20.404
No, I have no maximum velocity.

06:22.206 --> 06:25.477
My power is untethered and ever-growing.

06:34.819 --> 06:36.851
Do aliens even have feelings?

06:36.853 --> 06:38.486
Dude, I don't care if they have feelings.

06:38.488 --> 06:41.022
The Silver Surfer is the
loneliest dude in the galaxy.

06:41.024 --> 06:42.490
I don't... I mean...

06:42.492 --> 06:44.327
The Punisher's pretty haunted, dude.

06:44.329 --> 06:46.829
Look, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:46.831 --> 06:49.397
Don't even start me in
with that Punisher shit.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.000
Shit. Is that Daryl?

06:52.002 --> 06:53.635
Leave him alone.

06:53.637 --> 06:54.904
What's up, cock fighters?

06:54.906 --> 06:56.307
What, you wanna go?

06:56.874 --> 06:58.043
Huh?

07:00.845 --> 07:02.445
- Hi.
- I'm Josh.

07:02.447 --> 07:03.913
You don't go to our school, do you?

07:03.915 --> 07:06.882
No. Callaway Middle. Yeah.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.186
Go Cougars.

07:09.754 --> 07:12.355
Oh, you're... You're
Carol's little brother?

07:12.357 --> 07:14.457
- Yeah, I'm Charlie.
- Oh, right. Carol Barth.

07:14.459 --> 07:15.724
I know who Carol is.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.392
Everybody knows who Tig is.

07:17.394 --> 07:18.426
Come on, man.

07:18.428 --> 07:19.428
Tig Bitty Bart.

07:19.430 --> 07:21.029
- You love it. You love it.
- Oh, my God. Stop.

07:21.031 --> 07:22.567
You smell like a cat box.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.437
These are fucking chopped onions.

07:26.504 --> 07:27.539
What are you getting?

07:28.238 --> 07:29.307
Nice.

07:31.242 --> 07:35.110
Ew. Melon soda? Sounds gross.

07:35.112 --> 07:36.846
They wouldn't make it if it was gross.

07:36.848 --> 07:38.079
They make gross stuff all the time.

07:38.081 --> 07:39.382
Pickles are gross.

07:39.384 --> 07:41.253
- Pickles are not gross.
- I like pickles.

07:42.452 --> 07:45.755
Hey, what do you... What
do you make of that thing?

07:45.757 --> 07:47.259
Oh, that's been there forever.

07:48.992 --> 07:51.663
Dried squid? Holy shit!

07:53.764 --> 07:55.063
It's pretty gross.

07:55.065 --> 07:56.464
Somebody eats it.

07:56.466 --> 07:57.832
Nobody eats this shit.

07:57.834 --> 07:58.736
Let's get it.

07:59.836 --> 08:01.105
- Yes!
- Thank you.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.572
Oh, shit!

08:03.574 --> 08:04.873
Squid.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.007
Squid. Squid.

08:06.009 --> 08:07.476
- I wanna see you eat it.
- Squid.

08:07.478 --> 08:10.646
Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid.

08:10.648 --> 08:12.481
Squid. Come on.

08:12.483 --> 08:14.983
Squid. Squid. Squid.
Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid.

08:14.985 --> 08:16.584
Oh, God.

08:18.322 --> 08:19.490
Great.

08:22.026 --> 08:23.759
Give me some of that shit.

08:23.761 --> 08:26.327
- Try this.
- You guys are whacked.

08:26.329 --> 08:27.630
Seriously? Oh, my God, that's...

08:27.632 --> 08:29.031
Don't do it. Don't do... Oh!

08:29.033 --> 08:30.365
Oh, my God!

08:30.367 --> 08:32.336
It's horrible, isn't it?

08:33.602 --> 08:35.136
It's not terrible.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.871
It's not Skittles either, is it?

08:36.874 --> 08:38.477
No, it's not Skittles.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.111
Skittles is fucking delicious.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.582
Fuck this fucking shit.

08:46.049 --> 08:47.116
Oh, fuck!

08:47.118 --> 08:49.121
It's nasty. Oh, my God!

08:52.289 --> 08:55.257
Guys, lately I've been
thinking a lot about hands.

08:55.259 --> 08:57.193
What the fuck you thinking about hands?

08:57.195 --> 08:59.427
If I got one or both hands cut off,

08:59.429 --> 09:02.297
what kind of prosthetic hands I would wear.

09:02.299 --> 09:04.266
If I lost a hand, I'd
definitely get a hook.

09:04.268 --> 09:06.035
Yeah, fucking hook.

09:06.037 --> 09:07.103
Like from <i>Peter Pan?</i> Seriously?

09:07.105 --> 09:08.237
But why stop there?

09:08.239 --> 09:10.305
There's so many different types of hands.

09:10.307 --> 09:12.675
You could have a hot hand

09:12.677 --> 09:14.509
that just cooks steaks.

09:14.511 --> 09:16.411
A fucking hot hand is not a fucking thing.

09:16.413 --> 09:19.080
You could fucking have lighter hands.

09:19.082 --> 09:21.218
Fucking set shit on fire.

09:22.552 --> 09:24.252
Why is this bridge even closed?

09:24.254 --> 09:25.387
Yeah, what the fuck?

09:25.389 --> 09:26.789
You guys didn't hear? Somebody died.

09:26.791 --> 09:27.823
No one died.

09:27.825 --> 09:29.592
- Somebody died?
- Yes.

09:29.594 --> 09:32.962
Don't fucking cry, Charlie.
Everybody fucking dies.

09:32.964 --> 09:34.696
I'm not gonna die.

09:34.698 --> 09:37.065
I'm fucking immortal. Like Highlander.

09:37.067 --> 09:39.634
Hey, wait up, you motherfuckers.

09:39.636 --> 09:44.305
Tomorrow marks the end of my
week-long fast from masturbating.

09:44.307 --> 09:46.108
Why the fuck would you
ever do that to yourself?

09:46.110 --> 09:48.477
Because if you wait like a week,

09:48.479 --> 09:50.613
it feels really good
when you go back to it.

09:50.615 --> 09:55.017
Guys, yesterday my parents fucking
rented that movie <i>True Lies.</i>

09:55.019 --> 09:59.088
And after they went to sleep, I fucking
watched that scene where she stripped

09:59.090 --> 10:01.489
over and over and over and over and over.

10:01.491 --> 10:04.193
I must have jerked off
two and a half times.

10:04.195 --> 10:05.794
- Is that a record?
- We don't wanna hear this.

10:05.796 --> 10:07.729
I tried for three, but my dick got sore.

10:07.731 --> 10:09.498
So I went to the freezer to get some ice,

10:09.500 --> 10:10.900
but there was none in the tray.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.600
So I got a fucking steak instead.

10:12.602 --> 10:14.603
Ugh. You put it back in the freezer?

10:14.605 --> 10:16.671
Fuck no. I cooked that shit up,

10:16.673 --> 10:18.706
scarfed it and passed out on the couch.

10:18.708 --> 10:20.276
Dude, that's fucking disgusting.

10:20.278 --> 10:21.544
You fucking idiots.

10:21.546 --> 10:24.146
Of course I fucking put it back.

10:24.148 --> 10:25.381
You know, that doesn't make it better.

10:25.383 --> 10:26.815
Someone's gonna eat that.

10:26.817 --> 10:28.316
Oh, my God. This is not the
point of the fucking story.

10:28.318 --> 10:29.517
What is the point of the story?

10:29.519 --> 10:31.052
- I'm getting to it.
- He's getting to it.

10:31.054 --> 10:34.723
The point it, bitch be hot.

10:34.725 --> 10:36.090
Like Charlie's sister.

10:36.092 --> 10:38.026
Shut the fuck up.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.161
Or Zach's mom.

10:39.163 --> 10:41.198
Yes. Sorry, Zach.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.319
You think if you jump from
up here on a boat down there,

11:03.321 --> 11:05.387
you could break through
the deck and sink it?

11:05.389 --> 11:07.225
Like in a cartoon or something?

11:08.024 --> 11:09.190
I doubt it.

11:09.192 --> 11:11.660
My uncle did it one time
on the Fourth of July.

11:11.662 --> 11:12.661
No, he didn't.

11:12.663 --> 11:13.762
Yeah, he did.

11:13.764 --> 11:15.296
He won a thousand bucks,
but broke his fucking leg,

11:15.298 --> 11:16.364
'cause he slipped on a fish.

11:16.366 --> 11:17.699
Guess that evens out then.

11:17.701 --> 11:18.434
Fuck, yeah.

11:18.436 --> 11:20.338
Slickest shit I ever saw.

11:21.239 --> 11:22.304
I could do it.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.939
Are you special forces?

11:23.941 --> 11:25.174
No, but my uncle was.

11:25.176 --> 11:26.975
So fuck you.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.733
I guess I just, like, feel
bad for Daryl, you know.

12:24.735 --> 12:27.036
We used to hang out a lot in third grade.

12:27.038 --> 12:29.838
And it's not his fault
that his dad's fucking poor.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.674
Still, it doesn't make him not a douchebag.

12:31.676 --> 12:33.742
He's not a douchebag, Josh.

12:34.711 --> 12:36.645
Look, he can be a little much sometimes,

12:36.647 --> 12:39.547
but it's not like he
ever means anybody harm.

12:39.549 --> 12:41.552
Still hang out with him like in school?

12:42.986 --> 12:44.355
We have health together.

12:45.889 --> 12:48.393
He's always trying to hit on Cindy Maples.

12:49.659 --> 12:51.794
Cindy Maples is the one
that went to the hospital

12:51.796 --> 12:54.095
because she had a frozen
hot dog in her vagina?

12:54.097 --> 12:55.229
Yeah, yeah. That's her.

12:55.231 --> 12:56.230
Cool.

12:56.232 --> 12:57.666
Give me that bong, Amber.

12:57.668 --> 12:58.467
Shit.

12:58.469 --> 12:59.604
Josh, we have to go.

13:03.307 --> 13:04.739
Hey, hey, hey.

13:04.741 --> 13:06.507
- Hey. Hey!
- Josh, don't stop.

13:06.509 --> 13:07.946
- Just keep going.
- What?

13:09.046 --> 13:10.746
You seen my cunt?

13:10.748 --> 13:11.512
Forget it.

13:11.514 --> 13:13.648
- What?
- Have you seen my cunt?

13:13.650 --> 13:15.150
Josh...

13:15.152 --> 13:16.752
Dana, his girlfriend.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.420
We haven't seen anybody's cunt.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.254
We're actually kind of in a rush.

13:20.256 --> 13:21.989
Josh, right?

13:21.991 --> 13:24.059
- Yeah.
- How's Danny doing?

13:24.061 --> 13:25.960
He get that basic training?

13:25.962 --> 13:27.331
They break him in yet?

13:27.998 --> 13:29.196
What?

13:29.198 --> 13:31.199
Tell him I wanna hang out with
him when he's back in town.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.071
I bet he's great at sucking dick now.

13:35.038 --> 13:36.607
Josh's brother joined the Navy.

13:38.908 --> 13:40.242
It's the Marines.

13:40.244 --> 13:41.310
What?

13:41.312 --> 13:42.710
It's the fucking Marines!

13:42.712 --> 13:44.481
- What's that?
- Fuck you!

13:47.418 --> 13:48.483
What did you say?

13:48.485 --> 13:49.788
Careful, his pussy's out.

13:50.855 --> 13:52.253
Fucking Marines.

13:52.255 --> 13:54.189
Damn right it is.

13:54.191 --> 13:56.257
You boys wanna join the fucking Marines?

13:56.259 --> 13:57.629
I'm recruiting tonight.

13:59.596 --> 14:01.329
Fuck those fucking fuckers!

14:01.331 --> 14:02.765
Fuck John Whitcomb too.

14:02.767 --> 14:05.566
What kind of asshole
puts Kool-Aid in his hair?

14:05.568 --> 14:07.402
People like that are fucking worthless.

14:07.404 --> 14:09.204
John is okay.

14:09.206 --> 14:11.773
He used to be until he started
hanging out with these pieces of shit.

14:11.775 --> 14:13.742
All right, Josh. We're over it.

14:13.744 --> 14:15.276
- Doesn't matter now.
- Yeah, whatever.

14:15.278 --> 14:16.715
Man, come on. Let's go this way.

14:18.014 --> 14:19.314
Come on.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.518
That's her house.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.718
Who, Allison?

14:22.720 --> 14:24.118
Uh-huh.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.320
How do you know where she lives?

14:26.322 --> 14:29.727
We would take the same bus
before they changed the route.

14:31.294 --> 14:32.429
She's cool, right?

14:33.230 --> 14:34.729
She is very cool.

14:34.731 --> 14:36.498
You could leave her a note if you wanted.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.636
"Dear, Allison. I had this
idea for the talent show."

14:42.639 --> 14:44.542
Ever told you of that
time with the glue bottle?

14:45.075 --> 14:46.441
No.

14:46.443 --> 14:48.142
It was like...

14:48.144 --> 14:50.411
You know, it was like last year.

14:50.413 --> 14:52.180
I'm doing art and you know when like...

14:52.182 --> 14:54.782
In the glue bottles, when
the glue dries over on the top

14:54.784 --> 14:56.685
- and you can't open it?
- Uh-huh.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.287
So she was trying to open this glue bottle,

14:59.289 --> 15:02.324
she couldn't get it. I don't know, she
was just struggling for some reason.

15:02.326 --> 15:04.993
And I just couldn't stop staring at her.

15:04.995 --> 15:07.796
And then all of a sudden,
the whole thing just ruptured.

15:07.798 --> 15:11.699
Just went... Shit, there's
white glue all over her hands.

15:11.701 --> 15:15.038
And she just looked
and whispered, "Whoops."

15:18.442 --> 15:20.144
It was the most erotic moment of my life.

15:22.011 --> 15:24.081
You know, 'cause the glue is like sperm.

15:24.315 --> 15:25.714
Oh.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.282
So the bottle is sort of like the penis!

15:28.284 --> 15:29.550
Dude, come on. What the fuck?

15:29.552 --> 15:31.752
Nobody is here. Nobody is here, Josh.

15:31.754 --> 15:33.287
- The car's not in the drive.
- There's other people.

15:33.289 --> 15:34.489
There's nobody around here.

15:34.491 --> 15:35.826
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

15:43.033 --> 15:44.436
Oh.

15:50.374 --> 15:52.143
- Hey.
- You got me.

15:53.476 --> 15:55.611
- Oh, hey, Josh.
- Hey, Mrs. Taylor.

15:55.613 --> 15:56.911
Are you staying for dinner?

15:56.913 --> 15:58.780
No, ma'am. I'm just here
to pick up my things.

15:58.782 --> 16:00.618
Great. 'Cause I didn't make enough.

16:01.384 --> 16:03.318
My, um, parents have been

16:03.320 --> 16:04.987
wanting me home earlier lately,

16:04.989 --> 16:08.156
because my mom gets
depressed if I'm not there.

16:08.158 --> 16:10.425
- Aw!
- He's full of shit.

16:10.427 --> 16:11.995
- Now...
- It's all crap.

16:13.630 --> 16:15.632
- All right.
- Bye.

16:16.399 --> 16:17.935
- See you, man.
- Yeah.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.537
What are you making?

16:22.539 --> 16:24.174
Cubed steak.

16:25.643 --> 16:26.807
What's that?

16:26.809 --> 16:30.080
It's a steak in cubed form.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.850
Oh, you, sir...

16:34.018 --> 16:35.253
had a telephone call.

16:35.785 --> 16:36.785
Okay?

16:36.787 --> 16:38.453
Why are you acting so weird?

16:38.455 --> 16:40.188
It was a girl.

16:40.190 --> 16:42.760
Allison something. The
number is by the phone.

16:44.227 --> 16:45.594
Oh, um...

16:45.596 --> 16:47.999
I'm just gonna be in my
room for a second, actually.

16:48.765 --> 16:50.567
We eat in ten minutes.

16:55.538 --> 16:57.805
- <i>What?</i>
- Hey, is Allison there?

16:57.807 --> 16:58.873
<i>No.</i>

16:58.875 --> 17:00.278
<i>Who is that? Give it to me.</i>

17:02.278 --> 17:03.579
<i>Who is this?</i>

17:03.581 --> 17:05.613
Uh, hey, this is Zach.

17:05.615 --> 17:08.214
<i>Hi, Zach. Sorry, my brother...</i>

17:08.217 --> 17:10.017
No, it's cool.

17:10.019 --> 17:11.623
So, wait. You called me?

17:12.122 --> 17:13.888
<i>Yeah, um, sorry.</i>

17:13.891 --> 17:17.425
<i>I still had your number from that
thing we did in Mrs. Moore's class,</i>

17:17.428 --> 17:18.660
<i>uh, with the planets.</i>

17:18.662 --> 17:19.928
With the... Yeah.

17:19.930 --> 17:21.963
<i>Yeah. You know, with the song.</i>

17:21.964 --> 17:27.335
<i>â™ª Dead on a plant Where the
nuts are Mostly carbon-dioxide â™ª</i>

17:29.873 --> 17:32.043
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Yeah, I totally remember that.

17:32.910 --> 17:34.278
<i>Yeah, cool.</i>

17:36.079 --> 17:37.181
Cool.

17:37.914 --> 17:39.881
<i>So, the reason I'm calling,</i>

17:39.883 --> 17:41.549
<i>I'm having a birthday party thing.</i>

17:41.551 --> 17:43.151
<i>I mean, it's really
more of a hangout.</i>

17:43.153 --> 17:45.886
<i>Like, you don't have to bring
presents or anything like that.</i>

17:45.888 --> 17:48.123
<i>But it's gonna be at Meghan's house,</i>

17:48.125 --> 17:50.359
<i>and we're just gonna hang
out, watch some movies...</i>

17:50.361 --> 17:54.930
<i>Uh, I was wondering if you
and Josh wanted to come.</i>

17:54.932 --> 17:58.566
<i>You still hang out with
Josh Templeton, right?</i>

17:58.568 --> 18:00.067
Yeah, he just left here.

18:00.069 --> 18:02.136
<i>Oh, God. You guys...</i>

18:02.138 --> 18:04.105
<i>Allison, get off the fucking phone!</i>

18:11.181 --> 18:12.182
Boy!

18:33.403 --> 18:34.905
Allison.

18:36.006 --> 18:37.439
Hey, I scored your test today.

18:37.441 --> 18:39.207
- You got a 96.
- What!

18:39.209 --> 18:40.976
- Oh, that's great.
- That's amazing.

18:40.978 --> 18:46.248
I know you were nervous but
your grade had one problem...

18:59.529 --> 19:00.661
Yo.

19:00.663 --> 19:02.133
Hey, what's up?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.103
- Dude, use your locker.
- No.

19:06.737 --> 19:08.706
That map shit you were asking for.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.972
Oh, shit! I totally forg...

19:11.974 --> 19:13.607
What's up, fuckers?

19:13.609 --> 19:14.809
Hey, Daryl.

19:14.811 --> 19:16.179
Hey, are you guys hanging out after school?

19:17.381 --> 19:18.680
Yeah, probably.

19:18.682 --> 19:20.548
Can I write "Loser" on your backpack?

19:20.550 --> 19:21.682
What?

19:27.324 --> 19:28.422
What the fuck?

19:29.759 --> 19:31.695
Watch it, you piece of shit.

19:35.031 --> 19:37.431
Bagel Bites are the best food.

19:37.433 --> 19:39.301
I don't like them. They
burn the roof of my mouth.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.469
Because you're doing it wrong.

19:41.471 --> 19:44.706
Charlie's mom always keeps
the fridge stacked with these.

19:44.708 --> 19:45.907
I like Charlie.

19:45.909 --> 19:48.442
'Cause he's smart, his sister has big tits,

19:48.444 --> 19:51.179
and he always has fucking snacks.

19:51.181 --> 19:52.283
Where is Charlie?

19:52.883 --> 19:55.616
Probably sucking a dick.

19:55.618 --> 19:57.885
He said he wanted to hang out later.

19:57.887 --> 19:59.821
Daryl, don't sit on the counter.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.392
This fucking guy.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.261
Where are your folks, Josh?

20:05.162 --> 20:07.394
Well, they both work, and then

20:07.396 --> 20:10.899
my brother usually has like
practice or lessons or something.

20:10.901 --> 20:13.901
So no one's here until
like 5:00 or 6:00 usually.

20:13.903 --> 20:16.604
His brother's like a total prodigy.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.940
I thought you had an older brother.

20:18.942 --> 20:21.045
Yeah, I do. Danny's in the Marines.

20:21.811 --> 20:23.844
His shit's still here?

20:23.846 --> 20:25.546
Shit? What do you mean "his shit"?

20:25.548 --> 20:27.117
Josh, you know, his shit.

20:28.184 --> 20:29.683
Oh.

20:29.685 --> 20:31.355
This place seems fucking haunted.

20:32.655 --> 20:34.189
This used to be a rec room.

20:34.191 --> 20:37.191
Danny started sleeping here
after he got his job at Harveys.

20:37.193 --> 20:38.226
Take your shoes off.

20:38.228 --> 20:39.964
You gotta be kidding me, dude.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.400
Welcome, welcome.

20:43.432 --> 20:44.533
Holy shit.

20:44.535 --> 20:45.600
I love this room.

20:45.602 --> 20:48.903
This place is fucking incredible!

20:48.905 --> 20:51.472
Look at all of them.

20:51.474 --> 20:52.476
Holy fuck.

20:53.676 --> 20:55.610
It's a fucking water bed.

20:55.612 --> 20:57.379
You're fucking kidding me!

20:57.381 --> 20:58.983
Holy shit.

20:59.782 --> 21:01.952
Look at that fucking ass.

21:02.653 --> 21:04.920
Is that his fucking girlfriend?

21:04.922 --> 21:07.221
Look at all these fucking asses.

21:07.223 --> 21:08.859
Holy fucking shit!

21:09.759 --> 21:11.095
Holy fuck.

21:12.395 --> 21:13.865
Holy fuck.

21:15.298 --> 21:17.000
Dude, dude...

21:17.601 --> 21:19.234
This is fucking weed.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.336
- Can I have some?
- No, you can't have some.

21:22.338 --> 21:24.506
Dude, I'll buy it off you.

21:24.508 --> 21:26.807
This is 100 bucks worth, more maybe.

21:26.809 --> 21:28.476
You should really sell this.

21:28.478 --> 21:29.811
I have no idea.

21:29.813 --> 21:31.680
Does pot go bad?

21:31.682 --> 21:33.113
I don't think so.

21:33.115 --> 21:35.549
Then he'll probably be looking
for it when he gets back.

21:35.551 --> 21:37.285
I mean, it might. I don't know.

21:37.287 --> 21:40.020
Dude, like a pinch. Let me get one pinch.

21:40.022 --> 21:42.489
- Why?
- I've never done it before.

21:42.491 --> 21:44.295
- Have you?
- No.

21:44.795 --> 21:46.361
- You?
- Yeah.

21:46.363 --> 21:47.728
In Colorado this one time.

21:47.730 --> 21:49.264
Was it awesome?

21:49.266 --> 21:51.298
I don't know. Just the
lights get really bright,

21:51.300 --> 21:53.000
- and then your head...
- He won't know.

21:53.002 --> 21:54.236
Not enough for him to know.

21:54.238 --> 21:55.871
How long has he been gone anyway?

21:55.873 --> 21:57.439
A year. I mean...

21:57.441 --> 21:59.274
He has eight years of
active duty, but Christmas...

21:59.276 --> 22:02.043
He can't even smoke weed
while he's a fucking Marine.

22:02.045 --> 22:03.978
This isn't Vietnam or whatever.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.580
They'll kick his ass out.

22:05.582 --> 22:06.680
Please.

22:06.682 --> 22:08.185
Please, please?

22:09.318 --> 22:10.651
I'll think about it.

22:10.653 --> 22:12.120
You'll think about it?

22:12.122 --> 22:13.858
- That's what I said.
- Guys...

22:14.924 --> 22:17.191
We should get a watermelon or something,

22:17.193 --> 22:20.194
'cause these fucking
nunchucks are pretty badass.

22:20.196 --> 22:21.729
Let me fucking see.

22:21.731 --> 22:23.731
- Come get 'em.
- No, I don't feel like getting up.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.232
- You're a bum
- Fuck you.

22:25.234 --> 22:26.236
Hey, guys.

22:28.005 --> 22:29.874
He's got something cooler than those.

22:38.248 --> 22:39.613
How sharp is it?

22:39.615 --> 22:40.815
Well...

22:40.817 --> 22:42.784
It's not bamboo grade, so...

22:42.786 --> 22:45.085
It's not a real, real sword, but,

22:45.087 --> 22:47.124
it's better than just a display thing.

22:48.825 --> 22:51.394
We used to fucking crush
milk cartons with this.

22:54.631 --> 22:56.868
So, can we, like, do that?

22:58.434 --> 23:00.403
This is so rad!

23:00.804 --> 23:02.006
Yes!

23:05.342 --> 23:11.015
Oh, here she comes. Motherfucker!

23:22.025 --> 23:23.057
That's so sick.

23:23.059 --> 23:24.625
Dude, do you wanna go?

23:24.627 --> 23:27.194
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let Charlie go.

23:27.196 --> 23:29.199
- Come on, let me go.
- Sure.

23:30.567 --> 23:32.036
Here, use this.

23:32.602 --> 23:33.638
Mm. Pretty sick.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.606
Come on.

23:39.608 --> 23:40.775
Come on.

23:40.777 --> 23:42.076
Oh, fuck.

23:42.078 --> 23:45.180
Here. Put it up on this
shit, like a tee-ball.

23:45.182 --> 23:47.248
I'm not good at baseball.

23:47.250 --> 23:48.984
Keep your eyes on it.

23:50.487 --> 23:51.686
Take a deep breath.

23:51.688 --> 23:53.921
Jesus!

23:53.923 --> 23:56.991
The trick is you should make the
blade seem as light as possible

23:56.993 --> 23:58.058
in your hands.

23:58.060 --> 23:59.526
You all right over there?

23:59.528 --> 24:00.961
What? Yeah.

24:00.963 --> 24:03.198
- What's happening?
- It's nothing. Just don't worry about it.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.333
What's he doing?

24:05.335 --> 24:06.304
Daryl.

24:07.336 --> 24:09.470
- Daryl, is that weed?
- Josh.

24:09.472 --> 24:12.474
Daryl, did you take that bag
of weed from my brother's room?

24:12.476 --> 24:13.741
I swear to God!

24:13.743 --> 24:16.010
- Dude, it's a fucking cigarette, man.
- Let me see it.

24:16.012 --> 24:18.179
- Daryl!
- Let me see that shit.

24:18.181 --> 24:20.215
- Daryl!
- Come and get it, motherfucker.

24:20.217 --> 24:21.382
Give it to me, I'm serious.

24:21.384 --> 24:23.183
- You want it, come and get it.
- I'm not kidding, Daryl.

24:23.185 --> 24:25.219
Don't fucking blow smoke in my face.

24:25.221 --> 24:26.955
- Daryl, come on...
- What?

24:26.957 --> 24:29.093
If you took the bag,
you should give it back.

24:29.893 --> 24:32.129
You guys are fucking lame.

24:33.195 --> 24:35.263
Lame!

24:35.265 --> 24:36.765
It's all right. Calm down, Daryl.

24:36.767 --> 24:38.302
- Daryl!
- Josh.

24:39.769 --> 24:41.068
Daryl, come on.

24:41.070 --> 24:42.303
Daryl, come on.

24:42.305 --> 24:44.639
What the fuck, dude. Don't...

24:44.641 --> 24:46.408
Don't do that.

24:46.410 --> 24:47.577
Fuck you guys.

24:49.746 --> 24:51.182
What the fuck?

24:52.048 --> 24:53.614
- Asshole!
- Dude, he's...

24:53.616 --> 24:55.049
Just give him a minute.

24:55.051 --> 24:57.552
How'd you like it if I came to
your house and took all your shit?

24:57.554 --> 24:58.819
Can you relax?

24:58.821 --> 25:01.756
Oh, you don't have anything.
You live in a fucking duplex.

25:01.758 --> 25:02.891
- Josh, can you stop?
- Motherfucker.

25:02.893 --> 25:04.028
Just relax.

25:04.661 --> 25:06.026
What?

25:06.028 --> 25:07.961
Zach, thanks for inviting me out today.

25:07.963 --> 25:09.797
Too bad your boyfriend's on the rag.

25:09.799 --> 25:12.499
When you get home, make sure
to slap him around a little bit.

25:12.501 --> 25:14.902
- Both of you just shut up.
- Keep him in fucking line.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.671
This is stupid, all right?

25:16.673 --> 25:18.209
Daryl, give me the bag.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.516
Fuck!

25:28.518 --> 25:30.285
Guess we should call it a day.

25:30.287 --> 25:31.689
Here's your stuff, man.

25:31.988 --> 25:33.688
Hey...

25:33.690 --> 25:35.159
Dude, relax.

25:35.759 --> 25:36.794
Relax.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.299
- Daryl.
- Daryl.

25:45.301 --> 25:46.603
Daryl!

25:47.136 --> 25:48.836
Stop! Stop!

25:48.838 --> 25:50.505
Guys, what the fuck are you doing?

25:50.507 --> 25:52.209
- What are you doing?
- Please, this is... Stop!

25:53.777 --> 25:56.311
Guys, this is just... You're
being idiots right now.

25:56.313 --> 25:58.313
- Okay? Can you just...
- Guys, please stop.

25:58.315 --> 26:00.014
Stop!

26:00.016 --> 26:01.685
Guys, this is not a good idea.

26:11.060 --> 26:12.526
Josh...

26:12.528 --> 26:13.694
- Josh!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

26:13.696 --> 26:16.029
- Josh, what did you...
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

26:16.031 --> 26:17.231
Oh, my God!

26:17.233 --> 26:18.999
What did you do? What are you doing?

26:22.071 --> 26:23.938
I don't know. I don't know.

26:23.940 --> 26:26.141
I don't know. Take it out.

26:26.143 --> 26:28.308
All right. I'm gonna take it out.

26:28.310 --> 26:30.844
What did you do! What did you fucking do!

26:30.846 --> 26:31.848
What did you do!

26:33.016 --> 26:35.115
Josh, what the fuck did you do!

26:37.753 --> 26:39.586
Okay, I'm gonna pull it out.

26:39.588 --> 26:42.257
No, no, no. Don't take it out!

26:42.259 --> 26:44.461
You're supposed to leave it in.

26:48.932 --> 26:50.201
Daryl.

26:50.834 --> 26:52.633
What the fuck!

27:09.752 --> 27:10.887
Daryl!

27:13.423 --> 27:14.692
Oh, shit!

27:16.759 --> 27:18.362
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

27:18.662 --> 27:20.331
Daryl!

27:25.468 --> 27:27.238
Daryl!

27:28.805 --> 27:30.341
Daryl!

27:33.542 --> 27:34.444
Daryl!

27:40.784 --> 27:42.182
Is he...

27:42.184 --> 27:43.854
I don't know. I don't know.

27:44.421 --> 27:47.188
Zach, can you please...

27:47.190 --> 27:48.989
It was an accident. Please believe me.

27:48.991 --> 27:50.792
I know, I know.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.927
I need you to calm down, okay?

27:52.929 --> 27:54.062
I need you to calm down.

27:54.064 --> 27:55.365
Zach...

27:56.132 --> 27:57.735
Oh, no.

27:58.734 --> 28:00.235
Daryl.

28:00.237 --> 28:01.572
Daryl, are you awake?

28:02.705 --> 28:03.907
Daryl.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.448
Is he dead?

28:18.954 --> 28:19.889
I can't...

28:20.723 --> 28:22.225
I can't touch you.

28:34.837 --> 28:35.905
He's dead. We're fucked.

28:38.607 --> 28:40.007
You stupid fuck.

28:43.212 --> 28:44.882
I'm sorry.

28:47.683 --> 28:49.252
I'm sorry!

28:50.185 --> 28:52.219
Zach, what do we do?

28:52.221 --> 28:54.555
I don't know... I don't know...

28:54.557 --> 28:55.858
Zach!

28:56.826 --> 28:58.394
Fuck!

29:01.798 --> 29:02.766
Fuck.

29:03.732 --> 29:05.368
We have to go.

29:07.202 --> 29:08.969
We have to go, right now.

29:08.971 --> 29:10.473
What are you doing?

29:13.343 --> 29:14.875
- We gotta leave.
- What are you doing?

29:14.877 --> 29:16.177
I'm covering him up.

29:16.179 --> 29:17.844
It's something, right? We just gotta,

29:17.846 --> 29:18.946
we gotta cover him up.

29:18.948 --> 29:20.180
- Should we get help?
- No, Josh.

29:20.182 --> 29:21.349
No one's gonna help us, all right?

29:21.351 --> 29:23.887
We need to bury the body, okay?

29:25.654 --> 29:27.290
I'm sorry, Zach.

29:30.059 --> 29:31.361
Guys...

29:39.635 --> 29:41.372
I think we should hide this too.

30:08.664 --> 30:09.732
And his bike?

30:10.467 --> 30:11.869
I'll take care of that.

30:32.689 --> 30:33.791
Are you sure?

30:34.124 --> 30:35.558
Yeah.

30:36.159 --> 30:37.728
Just have to hide it.

30:40.497 --> 30:41.765
It's getting dark.

30:42.932 --> 30:45.402
I don't think we should both get back late.

30:49.071 --> 30:51.774
You need to clean yourself
up before you go home.

31:00.750 --> 31:01.852
Thank you.

31:40.856 --> 31:42.091
Oh, shit.

32:45.755 --> 32:46.824
Oh.

32:47.222 --> 32:48.558
Hi.

32:48.958 --> 32:50.423
Sorry, uh...

32:50.425 --> 32:53.794
I just stopped by. Your mom
said you'd be home soon, so...

32:53.796 --> 32:55.798
She went downstairs to get some Cokes.

32:57.267 --> 32:58.602
God, it looks...

33:00.403 --> 33:01.904
I was on my bike.

33:02.438 --> 33:03.907
Are you okay?

33:11.980 --> 33:12.950
Hi.

33:13.982 --> 33:15.415
Hey.

33:15.417 --> 33:16.652
Looks rough.

33:17.753 --> 33:21.421
We have caffeine-free
Coke, if that's okay.

33:21.423 --> 33:22.826
There he is.

33:23.893 --> 33:24.725
You're bleeding.

33:24.727 --> 33:26.063
I fell off my bike.

33:27.430 --> 33:28.528
It's okay.

33:28.530 --> 33:30.233
Oh, it looks nasty.

33:32.367 --> 33:33.867
You should clean it.

33:33.869 --> 33:35.068
I will.

33:35.070 --> 33:36.240
Okay.

33:37.307 --> 33:38.875
I'm gonna...

33:40.809 --> 33:42.778
I'll be in my room for a second.

33:43.479 --> 33:45.615
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

33:50.286 --> 33:51.518
You can go down.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.920
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

33:52.922 --> 33:53.824
It's, uh...

33:54.523 --> 33:56.257
- on the left.
- Okay.

33:56.259 --> 33:58.161
- At the end.
- Thank you.

33:58.795 --> 33:59.863
Sure.

34:08.804 --> 34:10.873
I was just walking and I passed by.

34:12.442 --> 34:13.708
I guess I should have called first,

34:13.710 --> 34:15.675
but I didn't realize I'd
be so close to your house

34:15.677 --> 34:17.344
until I saw it, and then I said,

34:17.347 --> 34:18.911
"Oh, that's Zach's house.

34:18.914 --> 34:22.052
Maybe I should stop by and scream
'penis' at the top of my lungs."

34:24.920 --> 34:28.090
She's right. You should...
You should clean it.

34:29.425 --> 34:31.757
Yeah, I'm going to.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.697
You know, for now I'm just gonna do this.

34:42.438 --> 34:43.974
Do you want me to go?

35:09.632 --> 35:11.034
You okay?

35:12.467 --> 35:15.137
Yeah, I just really hurt my hand.

35:40.663 --> 35:42.231
Allison...

35:42.998 --> 35:44.166
Yeah?

36:24.474 --> 36:25.876
I'm sorry.

36:26.842 --> 36:28.344
Don't apologize.

36:36.418 --> 36:37.887
I like your room.

36:39.422 --> 36:40.724
It's cool.

36:41.190 --> 36:42.356
Yeah?

36:42.358 --> 36:43.260
Yeah.

36:47.797 --> 36:50.097
Uh... See you.

36:50.099 --> 36:51.835
Bye.

36:57.106 --> 36:58.375
Short visit then?

37:01.543 --> 37:03.376
Mm-hmm.

37:03.378 --> 37:05.848
Yeah, she has to go home.

37:07.884 --> 37:09.717
She's very cute.

37:09.719 --> 37:11.788
Yeah, I think so too.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.096
I'm gonna go to bed.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.262
It's early.

37:21.264 --> 37:23.400
Yeah. I'm tired.

37:25.233 --> 37:26.502
I'll probably read.

37:27.804 --> 37:30.037
- Did you eat anything?
- I'm fine, Mom.

37:30.039 --> 37:31.108
Okay.

37:35.478 --> 37:37.244
I love you.

37:37.246 --> 37:38.849
I love you too.

37:45.554 --> 37:47.356
Hey, I'm cleaning those cuts.

37:48.858 --> 37:50.927
Let's take a look.

37:52.728 --> 37:53.760
Ow, Mom.

37:53.762 --> 37:55.132
- That hurts?
- Yes.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.066
Can you... I'm sorry.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.537
- That, too?
- Yes. Please...

38:01.503 --> 38:02.838
Well, shit.

38:04.472 --> 38:05.909
I'll go get my keys.

38:52.288 --> 38:56.893
All right. Stephanie
is here. Larry is here.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.226
Scott definitely here.

38:59.228 --> 39:01.530
Greg has a new haircut. Good.

39:02.398 --> 39:04.063
Richard, back there.

39:04.065 --> 39:05.965
- Emily is here.
- Here.

39:05.967 --> 39:08.235
Zach attack is here,

39:08.237 --> 39:13.543
but Josh Templeton is
not. Okay. That's absent.

39:15.210 --> 39:16.378
Good stuff.

39:36.431 --> 39:37.998
Charlie!

39:38.000 --> 39:39.800
Hey, Charlie. Taking the short bus today?

39:39.802 --> 39:42.269
Yeah, man. Short bus is
for retards like Adam.

39:42.271 --> 39:44.003
Yo, man. That's super insensitive.

39:44.005 --> 39:46.076
- Hey, we gotta talk.
- No, we don't.

39:46.708 --> 39:48.043
Yeah, we do.

39:49.445 --> 39:50.947
Excuse me.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.049
I'll be right back.

39:56.418 --> 39:57.383
Who's that dickhead?

39:57.385 --> 39:59.221
I don't know. Some fuckin' dick.

40:00.322 --> 40:02.155
Chill for a second, all right? Calm down.

40:02.157 --> 40:04.326
No, just shut the fuck up
for a second, all right?

40:05.161 --> 40:06.327
What?

40:06.329 --> 40:08.064
Look, Josh is not coming to school.

40:08.998 --> 40:10.567
Okay. So go talk to him.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.166
Well, I am. I'm going to.

40:13.168 --> 40:15.001
I'm just saying that we should
probably get our story straight...

40:15.003 --> 40:16.603
There is no story, Zach.

40:16.605 --> 40:17.838
Yeah, well, if somebody asks.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.440
I don't remember.

40:19.442 --> 40:21.307
I don't remember what I did last Tuesday.

40:21.309 --> 40:23.209
So why would I remember
what I did this Tuesday?

40:23.211 --> 40:24.912
Probably I went home after school,

40:24.914 --> 40:26.947
stayed there alone until
my parents got home.

40:26.949 --> 40:28.351
It's what I do most weekdays.

40:29.784 --> 40:31.186
Okay, that's good.

40:33.322 --> 40:35.889
Okay, so why did you come running
over here to the middle school

40:35.891 --> 40:37.394
to talk to an eighth
grader you barely know?

40:38.460 --> 40:39.428
Zach.

40:39.894 --> 40:41.163
If anyone asks,

40:41.896 --> 40:43.365
we're not friends.

41:01.983 --> 41:03.385
Josh?

41:05.387 --> 41:06.722
Josh?

41:09.992 --> 41:11.094
Yo, Josh!

41:24.873 --> 41:25.975
Zach?

41:26.675 --> 41:27.978
Can I come in?

41:28.744 --> 41:30.043
Uh, yeah.

41:30.045 --> 41:31.413
Of course.

41:34.016 --> 41:35.385
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:36.818 --> 41:39.389
- How's your...
- Oh, it's good. It's better.

41:42.824 --> 41:44.560
Do you remember Daryl Harper?

41:45.661 --> 41:47.163
You two used to play together.

41:52.201 --> 41:54.570
Yeah. But, I mean, that
was like a long time ago.

41:55.971 --> 41:57.304
Why?

41:57.306 --> 41:59.440
I had a call from his mom earlier.

41:59.442 --> 42:02.041
Guess he never came home last night.

42:02.043 --> 42:03.512
He hasn't been home yet at all.

42:04.413 --> 42:06.081
Did you see him at school today?

42:10.853 --> 42:12.485
I mean, I didn't see him.

42:12.487 --> 42:14.688
But I wasn't looking for him, so...

42:14.690 --> 42:16.623
I have no idea.

42:16.625 --> 42:18.527
Do you remember the last
time you did see him?

42:21.630 --> 42:22.599
Nope.

42:23.364 --> 42:24.266
No.

42:25.668 --> 42:28.805
His mother said something about
him going at Josh's yesterday.

42:32.007 --> 42:34.007
Uh, no.

42:34.009 --> 42:35.842
He didn't?

42:35.844 --> 42:37.413
- At Josh's house?
- Yeah.

42:38.414 --> 42:39.349
No.

42:39.981 --> 42:42.081
No, he wasn't there.

42:42.083 --> 42:43.550
- He wasn't?
- No, I was at Josh's all day.

42:43.552 --> 42:45.088
He wasn't there. It was just us.

42:48.958 --> 42:50.059
Okay.

42:51.159 --> 42:52.394
I'll tell her.

42:56.164 --> 42:58.400
You came home a little bit late last night.

43:02.003 --> 43:03.639
Yeah, I guess.

43:04.773 --> 43:06.342
Don't do that anymore.

43:07.108 --> 43:09.476
I'm sure Daryl will turn up,

43:09.478 --> 43:13.213
but if something happened
or some... I don't know.

43:13.215 --> 43:16.385
Just stay close to the house
for the next few days, okay?

43:17.753 --> 43:20.256
- Yeah.
- Okay.

43:53.255 --> 43:54.724
<i>Tell me how... What time did you...</i>

44:02.931 --> 44:08.601
<i>Every one of us must fight the
struggle within our own spirit.</i>

44:08.603 --> 44:12.472
<i>We have to decide whether
we will define our lives</i>

44:12.474 --> 44:16.876
<i>primarily based on who
we are or who we are not,</i>

44:16.878 --> 44:21.518
<i>based on what we are for
or what we are against.</i>

44:29.958 --> 44:31.493
All right. I'm awake.

44:34.429 --> 44:36.532
All right, Mom.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.568
What time is it?

44:57.286 --> 44:58.954
Mom, what time is it?

45:00.856 --> 45:02.458
Mom, what time is it?

45:05.760 --> 45:07.463
Mom, what time is it?

45:16.838 --> 45:17.907
Mom?

45:22.411 --> 45:23.445
Mom?

45:55.543 --> 45:56.578
Daryl?

45:58.847 --> 46:00.583
What are you doing here?

46:03.351 --> 46:05.387
How did you get here, man?

46:31.780 --> 46:33.483
Daryl.

46:41.690 --> 46:42.925
Oh, God!

46:45.527 --> 46:46.663
Mom!

46:47.862 --> 46:48.963
Mom!

46:50.565 --> 46:52.499
- What is it? What's wrong? You okay?
- My stomach...

46:52.501 --> 46:54.233
- Your stomach?
- It hurts. Yeah.

46:54.235 --> 46:56.605
Okay, don't move. I'll be right back.

47:00.442 --> 47:01.911
That's it. Breathe.

47:03.211 --> 47:04.380
Count to eight.

47:06.382 --> 47:07.617
There you go.

47:08.583 --> 47:09.585
Better?

47:16.125 --> 47:17.427
A little better.

47:19.762 --> 47:21.293
You haven't eaten anything, Zach.

47:21.295 --> 47:22.864
That's probably what's wrong.

47:27.503 --> 47:29.439
I took some NyQuil.

47:29.771 --> 47:30.873
NyQuil?

47:31.606 --> 47:33.740
Could have been that.

47:33.742 --> 47:35.878
Why were you taking
NyQuil? You have a cold?

47:37.980 --> 47:40.646
I just can't get to sleep.

47:40.648 --> 47:42.916
Okay. Well, no more of that, all right?

47:42.918 --> 47:44.851
You can't just be taking
that stuff willy-nilly,

47:44.853 --> 47:46.519
especially on an empty stomach.

48:09.043 --> 48:10.943
Oh, my God.

48:10.945 --> 48:12.545
Did you hear about that missing boy?

48:12.547 --> 48:14.180
- Who?
- Daryl fucking Harper.

48:14.182 --> 48:15.782
Oh, my gosh.

48:15.784 --> 48:16.883
- Did you hear about that missing kid?
- No shit.

48:16.885 --> 48:18.684
Was that the guy in science class?

48:18.686 --> 48:20.119
- Oh, my God.
- Are you kidding me?

48:20.121 --> 48:21.887
- Oh, fuck. Daryl Harper.
- Daryl...

48:21.889 --> 48:23.423
That guy was a piece of shit.

48:23.425 --> 48:25.191
Daryl Harper had a filthy mouth.

48:27.896 --> 48:29.963
- Probably ran away from home.
- Good riddance.

48:29.965 --> 48:30.996
They haven't found him.

48:30.998 --> 48:31.998
No way.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.934
Oh, my gosh.

48:33.936 --> 48:35.037
He's missing, man.

48:36.237 --> 48:37.737
- Who cares?
- Are the cops involved?

48:37.739 --> 48:39.472
Everyone hated that dude anyway.

48:39.474 --> 48:41.141
He's gone. He disappeared.

48:41.143 --> 48:44.179
The scrotum, which is
a soft external sac...

48:45.514 --> 48:47.613
Class, settle down.

48:47.615 --> 48:49.382
Next, we have the vas deferens.

48:49.384 --> 48:53.186
The narrow tubes that carry sperm
from the testis to the seminal...

48:54.422 --> 48:55.722
<i>Attention, all students.</i>

48:55.724 --> 48:58.124
<i>This is your principal,
Dave Faith, speaking.</i>

48:58.126 --> 49:00.827
<i>I'm sure some of you are
aware of rumors regarding</i>

49:00.829 --> 49:03.229
<i>a missing student, Daryl Harper.</i>

49:03.231 --> 49:07.800
<i>I want to emphasize at this point
that they are only that, rumors.</i>

49:07.802 --> 49:11.007
<i>We as a school will be
cooperating with the police.</i>

49:12.306 --> 49:13.807
<i>Anyone who has any information</i>

49:13.809 --> 49:15.842
<i>regarding Daryl and his whereabouts,</i>

49:15.844 --> 49:17.443
<i>or even remember seeing Daryl,</i>

49:17.445 --> 49:20.412
on the day of the 14th is
encouraged to report to my office.

49:21.650 --> 49:23.182
<i>We're not looking to
get anyone in trouble,</i>

49:23.184 --> 49:26.820
<i>only to find Daryl and return
him safely to his family.</i>

49:26.822 --> 49:29.088
<i>I know we have the
holidays coming up,</i>

49:29.090 --> 49:31.624
<i>but I want everyone
to be safe and careful</i>

49:31.626 --> 49:34.094
<i>for the next few days
while we figure this out</i>

49:34.096 --> 49:35.595
<i>and put this all behind us.</i>

49:36.831 --> 49:39.099
<i>This is Principal Dave
Faith signing off.</i>

49:39.101 --> 49:40.635
<i>Have a good rest of the day.</i>

49:44.438 --> 49:46.673
- Hi, there, Zach.
- Hey, Ms. Templeton.

49:46.675 --> 49:49.543
- Is Josh home?
- He is.

49:49.545 --> 49:50.844
I've just been worried about him

49:50.846 --> 49:52.211
since he hasn't been in school.

49:52.213 --> 49:54.016
He hasn't been feeling well.

49:54.916 --> 49:58.117
Uh, could I come in maybe and see him?

49:58.119 --> 50:00.155
I'll ask and see if he's up for it.

50:00.889 --> 50:02.592
That'd be great. Thank you.

50:03.992 --> 50:05.161
Shoes off.

50:06.795 --> 50:07.864
Honey.

50:10.197 --> 50:11.533
Josh.

50:12.934 --> 50:14.237
Zach stopped by.

50:20.675 --> 50:22.010
Give him a minute.

50:24.545 --> 50:25.947
Thank you.

50:37.358 --> 50:38.561
Josh?

50:40.262 --> 50:41.530
It's Zach.

50:43.130 --> 50:44.232
I know.

50:46.168 --> 50:47.637
Can I come in?

50:50.038 --> 50:52.574
- Josh, can I come in?
- Yeah. I said okay.

51:00.414 --> 51:01.617
Hey, man.

51:03.318 --> 51:04.687
I haven't seen you.

51:05.554 --> 51:07.153
Yeah, Mom let me stay home.

51:07.155 --> 51:08.691
I said I didn't feel well.

51:09.557 --> 51:11.724
Okay, well, I...

51:11.726 --> 51:14.561
I don't think we should be
like acting weird or anything

51:14.563 --> 51:15.898
though, right?

51:18.166 --> 51:19.865
- Okay, Zach.
- Well, I'm just saying...

51:19.867 --> 51:23.068
I don't think it's a good
time to be drawing attention...

51:23.070 --> 51:24.039
I said okay.

51:25.574 --> 51:27.242
Yeah, I'm sorry.

51:41.456 --> 51:42.892
How are you?

51:47.161 --> 51:48.330
Yeah.

51:49.063 --> 51:50.266
Me too.

51:55.369 --> 51:57.072
I'm not getting any sleep.

52:00.842 --> 52:02.675
You know, my heart,

52:02.677 --> 52:05.313
it'll just start beating
sometimes real quick.

52:06.213 --> 52:07.248
Speed up.

52:08.817 --> 52:10.318
All of a sudden, just...

52:22.664 --> 52:24.100
I feel like we should go back.

52:25.434 --> 52:27.733
- Why?
- I don't know, but I...

52:27.735 --> 52:30.105
To check on him, you know, to see.

52:31.338 --> 52:33.338
I keep having these dreams

52:33.340 --> 52:34.641
and I'm thinking that...

52:34.643 --> 52:36.909
I don't know. I just don't think it's right

52:36.911 --> 52:38.677
to leave Daryl out there
all alone, you know.

52:38.679 --> 52:40.079
We got to do something with the body.

52:40.081 --> 52:42.282
Or at least let somebody
know that he's there.

52:42.284 --> 52:43.883
Be cure...

52:43.885 --> 52:45.955
I don't know. I just
keep thinking of his mom.

52:46.887 --> 52:48.921
You know, what's she thinking.

52:48.923 --> 52:50.289
She's probably waiting
for him to come home.

52:50.291 --> 52:52.094
Don't go back there. Scene of the crime.

52:58.065 --> 52:58.967
Yeah.

53:00.969 --> 53:03.068
Do you still have his stuff?

53:03.070 --> 53:04.637
What?

53:04.639 --> 53:06.505
The bag? Do you still have the bag...

53:06.507 --> 53:08.208
Yeah, yeah. It's here.

53:08.210 --> 53:10.242
Like, that's good.

53:10.244 --> 53:12.947
Just, I guess... Would you
just keep that hidden here?

53:14.583 --> 53:18.921
Yeah. It's here until I
decide to burn it or whatever.

53:20.387 --> 53:22.454
Will you not do that?

53:22.456 --> 53:23.623
And can you...

53:23.625 --> 53:25.557
Josh, it's kind of important that you,

53:25.559 --> 53:28.695
you not do something without
talking to me about it first, okay?

53:28.697 --> 53:29.832
I mean...

53:31.233 --> 53:32.702
If that's okay.

53:35.402 --> 53:36.471
Whatever.

53:42.577 --> 53:43.713
What game is this?

53:50.652 --> 53:52.221
Josh, what game is that?

54:00.027 --> 54:02.097
It was a fucking accident!

54:04.766 --> 54:07.133
Okay? It happened. A fucking accident.

54:07.135 --> 54:08.003
Just...

54:17.278 --> 54:19.181
What, are you trying to
break your other hand now?

54:27.289 --> 54:28.324
Yeah, it's...

54:34.362 --> 54:39.300
Allison Bannister is having
that party this weekend.

54:40.001 --> 54:42.034
We should probably go.

54:42.036 --> 54:43.105
Maybe.

54:47.208 --> 54:49.778
I haven't gotten that
much sleep either, so...

54:52.313 --> 54:53.449
I probably should...

54:58.018 --> 54:59.888
That'll be good for you.

55:10.164 --> 55:12.898
And if anybody asks, we didn't see Charlie

55:12.900 --> 55:14.435
or Daryl that day, okay?

55:15.469 --> 55:17.105
If anybody asks,

55:17.806 --> 55:19.175
we're already fucked.

57:55.195 --> 57:56.230
Zach.

57:57.065 --> 57:58.567
- Zach? Hey.
- Mm.

57:59.434 --> 58:00.666
Hey.

58:00.668 --> 58:01.934
Try to stay with us.

58:01.936 --> 58:03.635
Okay?

58:03.637 --> 58:05.637
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

58:05.639 --> 58:08.340
All right, everybody.
Let's turn back to page 62.

58:09.878 --> 58:12.478
On top of the page. Why don't you
read the first couple of paragraphs?

58:12.480 --> 58:14.847
Ms. Barron, can I go to the bathroom?

58:14.849 --> 58:16.148
I'm not feeling so good.

58:16.150 --> 58:18.251
Yeah, go ahead. Grab the pass, please.

58:18.253 --> 58:19.786
Um, then we'll discuss as a class.

58:19.788 --> 58:20.887
Boner.

58:20.889 --> 58:22.257
Thank you. That's enough.

58:32.300 --> 58:34.635
What? You planning on looking at my dick?

58:46.146 --> 58:47.479
I hate reading.

58:47.481 --> 58:49.248
I'm sure that they'll
try to give us a curfew

58:49.250 --> 58:51.883
if Daryl Doofus doesn't show up soon.

58:51.885 --> 58:53.686
That would blow.

58:53.688 --> 58:55.387
Little biatch is ruining it for everybody.

58:55.389 --> 58:56.588
Don't be a dick, Paul.

58:56.590 --> 58:58.925
I'm just telling it how it is.

58:58.927 --> 59:00.693
I don't need your fucking help, lady!

59:00.695 --> 59:03.061
Okay, that's it. To the office.

59:03.063 --> 59:04.197
That's nuts.

59:04.199 --> 59:05.465
Oh, snap, you guys.

59:05.467 --> 59:07.166
I just saw the craziest
thing in Spanish class.

59:07.168 --> 59:08.700
You guys know Josh Templeton?

59:08.702 --> 59:10.036
What did he do?

59:10.038 --> 59:12.407
He called Mrs. Campos the "C" word.

59:13.041 --> 59:14.507
I swear to God!

59:14.509 --> 59:16.075
He came in with all attitude this morning.

59:16.077 --> 59:18.244
Like totally ignoring her
when she called on him.

59:18.246 --> 59:21.481
So she goes, "I don't
recall you being deaf, Josh."

59:21.483 --> 59:24.816
And he was all, "I don't recall
you being such a dumb cunt."

59:26.253 --> 59:27.552
What did she say?

59:27.554 --> 59:28.987
She sent him right to the office.

59:28.989 --> 59:30.692
- Just now?
- Yeah, like ten minutes ago.

59:45.706 --> 59:47.740
Can I help you?

59:47.742 --> 59:51.276
Um, my mom said to wait here.

59:51.278 --> 59:53.045
She was gonna call me at lunch.

59:53.047 --> 59:55.317
So, uh... All right. Thank you.

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.307
Zach.

01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:56.775
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Meghan.

01:00:56.777 --> 01:00:59.045
I'm guessing this is Allison's party, yeah?

01:00:59.047 --> 01:01:01.250
Yeah, this is my house though.

01:01:01.548 --> 01:01:03.481
Great.

01:01:03.483 --> 01:01:07.086
She said it was just gonna be
a few people watching movies.

01:01:07.088 --> 01:01:08.454
Yeah, I know. That was the plan.

01:01:08.456 --> 01:01:10.822
And then my grandpa got
sick, so my parents...

01:01:10.824 --> 01:01:11.856
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

01:01:11.858 --> 01:01:13.325
No, it's awesome.

01:01:13.327 --> 01:01:14.762
Party on the upgrade.

01:01:15.929 --> 01:01:17.431
Yeah, great.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.668
I should probably go say
happy birthday to Allison.

01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:24.939
Totally. Hey.

01:01:29.777 --> 01:01:31.610
- You're doing it wrong.
- How am I doing it wrong?

01:01:31.612 --> 01:01:33.514
This is the only way we do it.

01:01:37.018 --> 01:01:38.050
Hey.

01:01:38.052 --> 01:01:39.719
Hey.

01:01:39.721 --> 01:01:41.253
Happy birthday.

01:01:41.255 --> 01:01:42.757
- You came.
- Of course.

01:01:45.592 --> 01:01:47.195
Zach. Yo.

01:01:48.262 --> 01:01:49.695
Hey, man.

01:01:49.697 --> 01:01:51.666
Actually, Allison. I have, um...

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.099
a present for you.

01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:55.333
- What?
- If I can find it.

01:01:55.335 --> 01:01:56.534
You didn't have to do that.

01:01:56.536 --> 01:01:57.638
Yeah, no one else did.

01:01:58.706 --> 01:02:00.309
It's okay. Give it to me anyways.

01:02:01.476 --> 01:02:03.545
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:02:04.646 --> 01:02:05.914
Okay.

01:02:09.182 --> 01:02:10.619
What!

01:02:11.052 --> 01:02:12.952
This is so cool.

01:02:12.954 --> 01:02:14.356
Thank you.

01:02:18.159 --> 01:02:20.025
Oh, my God. Okay.

01:02:20.027 --> 01:02:22.028
I know how to do this, I think.

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:23.632
Let me see if Meghan has papers.

01:02:24.632 --> 01:02:25.567
Sorry.

01:02:27.768 --> 01:02:30.004
Weed? Cool.

01:02:30.838 --> 01:02:31.906
Mm.

01:02:34.976 --> 01:02:36.744
Josh, can I ask you something?

01:02:37.478 --> 01:02:38.447
Yeah.

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:45.483
What's up, man?

01:02:45.485 --> 01:02:46.922
You didn't tell me you were coming.

01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:49.591
You told me to come.

01:02:52.193 --> 01:02:53.895
So, were you in school on Friday?

01:02:54.996 --> 01:02:56.431
Um, yeah.

01:02:58.965 --> 01:03:00.532
Yeah, I know.

01:03:00.534 --> 01:03:01.467
Hmm?

01:03:01.469 --> 01:03:03.202
What's up with the weed?

01:03:03.204 --> 01:03:04.637
What?

01:03:04.639 --> 01:03:07.173
Isn't your brother gonna notice
that that stuff's missing?

01:03:07.175 --> 01:03:08.410
Got it.

01:03:08.909 --> 01:03:10.041
Come on, guys.

01:03:10.043 --> 01:03:11.312
Come on, man.

01:03:13.114 --> 01:03:14.746
Okay, it's a page from the Bible,

01:03:14.748 --> 01:03:15.981
but it's not an important one.

01:03:15.983 --> 01:03:17.983
It's like from the
introduction or something.

01:03:17.985 --> 01:03:19.084
The point is, it will work.

01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:21.119
I've seen my brother do
it like a million times.

01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:22.887
Smells so good.

01:03:22.889 --> 01:03:24.724
Where'd you get this shit from, Josh?

01:03:24.726 --> 01:03:25.825
For real.

01:03:25.827 --> 01:03:27.929
Um, I know a guy.

01:03:28.496 --> 01:03:29.965
Can you hook me up?

01:03:31.065 --> 01:03:32.501
Uh, yeah.

01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:34.602
Talk to me tomorrow.

01:03:35.068 --> 01:03:36.501
Cool.

01:03:36.503 --> 01:03:38.104
We have enough for two.

01:03:38.106 --> 01:03:39.537
But Allison gets to go twice first,

01:03:39.539 --> 01:03:40.740
because she's the birthday girl.

01:03:40.742 --> 01:03:42.240
Fuck that. It's puff, puff, pass.

01:03:42.242 --> 01:03:43.545
Shut up, John.

01:03:46.179 --> 01:03:47.648
Pass that shit.

01:03:51.985 --> 01:03:54.722
I'm gonna go, actually.

01:03:55.856 --> 01:03:57.123
Really?

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:59.958
Yeah. I just wanted to stop by.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.327
Cool. Bye.

01:04:01.329 --> 01:04:03.362
Have a good birthday.

01:04:03.364 --> 01:04:04.733
I'll see you, Josh.

01:04:04.998 --> 01:04:05.933
Cool.

01:04:07.201 --> 01:04:08.536
Excuse me.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:19.114
Zach.

01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:22.817
Are you okay?

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:25.921
Yeah. I'm not really a party person,

01:04:27.355 --> 01:04:29.490
but I wanted to say happy birthday, so...

01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:37.563
There's just a lot going on right now.

01:04:37.565 --> 01:04:39.101
Mm. Seems that way.

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:45.873
They ran out of blue, huh?

01:04:48.175 --> 01:04:49.575
"They ran out of blue"? What?

01:04:49.577 --> 01:04:53.081
- Your cast, it's pink.
- Oh, oh. Duh. Yeah.

01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:58.383
It's nice. It suits you.

01:04:58.385 --> 01:04:59.788
Sensitive boy.

01:05:01.489 --> 01:05:03.555
Well, if you got a lot going on,

01:05:03.557 --> 01:05:08.092
why don't you come back
inside and hang out?

01:05:08.094 --> 01:05:10.498
Smoke. You know. Relax a little.

01:05:13.134 --> 01:05:14.568
I don't really do that.

01:05:15.268 --> 01:05:16.937
Smoke, you know...

01:05:19.206 --> 01:05:20.438
And honestly, neither does Josh.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.676
I think he just did that
to fucking impress you.

01:05:24.644 --> 01:05:26.014
Which is lame, you know.

01:05:30.184 --> 01:05:31.316
I'm sorry, Allison...

01:05:31.318 --> 01:05:32.751
Oh, fuck!

01:05:32.753 --> 01:05:34.854
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:05:34.856 --> 01:05:36.287
It's all right.

01:05:41.161 --> 01:05:42.630
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:05:43.697 --> 01:05:45.199
You got a bump on your head.

01:06:05.119 --> 01:06:06.488
Why don't you kiss me?

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:12.594
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:06:16.163 --> 01:06:17.829
I'm so sorry, Allison.

01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:18.933
It's okay.

01:06:26.273 --> 01:06:27.808
I've just gotta go.

01:06:28.141 --> 01:06:29.009
Okay.

01:06:30.344 --> 01:06:31.913
I hope you have a great birthday.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.082
Thank you.

01:07:15.956 --> 01:07:17.289
Psst. Hey.

01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:18.324
What's up?

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:20.258
Yo, dude. You hear that shit?

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:21.526
What shit?

01:07:21.528 --> 01:07:24.128
That guy, he's dead.

01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:25.630
They found him dead.

01:07:25.632 --> 01:07:27.032
Yeah, I don't know anything about that.

01:07:27.034 --> 01:07:30.369
- It's John Whitcomb.
- Wait. John Whitcomb is dead?

01:07:30.371 --> 01:07:31.970
<i>Dude with with blue hair.</i>

01:07:31.972 --> 01:07:33.671
When? When the fuck did this happen?

01:07:33.673 --> 01:07:34.773
They found him yesterday.

01:07:34.775 --> 01:07:36.177
He fell off the bridge.

01:07:37.411 --> 01:07:39.478
- Fuck!
- I know.

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.884
I had algebra with him.
Small fucking world.

01:07:43.784 --> 01:07:46.117
Yeah, it seems to be.

01:07:46.119 --> 01:07:48.887
I was supposed to buy some
weed from him today too.

01:07:48.889 --> 01:07:50.858
He said he was going to
hook up from some other dude.

01:07:52.159 --> 01:07:53.628
I'm not getting my weed.

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:56.260
Hey...

01:07:56.262 --> 01:07:57.565
You got some weed?

01:07:59.467 --> 01:08:00.869
Yo, you got some weed?

01:08:02.902 --> 01:08:05.306
Hey, you got some weed?

01:08:14.815 --> 01:08:16.585
I walked in on him once

01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:19.251
in the bathroom.

01:08:19.252 --> 01:08:21.923
In the bus bathroom on that trip to
the Flight Museum. Do you remember that?

01:08:24.158 --> 01:08:25.660
No, I didn't go.

01:08:26.327 --> 01:08:27.295
Oh.

01:08:28.194 --> 01:08:29.827
Well...

01:08:29.828 --> 01:08:31.462
He didn't lock the door for some reason,

01:08:31.465 --> 01:08:33.598
and I saw everything.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.069
Full Whitcomb.

01:08:37.104 --> 01:08:38.173
Mm.

01:08:42.042 --> 01:08:44.144
You're friends with Tig, right?

01:08:45.444 --> 01:08:46.644
Who?

01:08:46.645 --> 01:08:48.082
Carol Barth.

01:08:48.747 --> 01:08:50.683
Yeah, sort of.

01:08:50.685 --> 01:08:53.018
Do you have her number?

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.956
Somewhere at home. I'd have to look it up.

01:08:55.555 --> 01:08:57.358
Here. Got a marker?

01:08:58.125 --> 01:08:59.327
Yeah.

01:09:04.497 --> 01:09:06.367
We're gonna take that...

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:18.380
Trade.

01:09:21.113 --> 01:09:22.613
So, what's this?

01:09:22.615 --> 01:09:24.415
It's my new number.

01:09:24.417 --> 01:09:26.151
My own line.

01:09:26.153 --> 01:09:27.785
Mom and Dad's birthday present.

01:09:27.787 --> 01:09:29.890
So I don't have to deal
with my brother anymore.

01:09:30.925 --> 01:09:34.026
Call tonight and I'll dig hers up for you.

01:09:34.028 --> 01:09:35.863
If you tell me why you want it.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.001
Did you just buy those?

01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:44.635
Is that okay?

01:09:44.636 --> 01:09:46.707
You know, I don't wanna
scare you off again.

01:09:48.006 --> 01:09:50.444
I'm messing with you, dummy.

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:55.949
Okay. Come on.

01:09:56.449 --> 01:09:58.019
Walk me home.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:01.719
I broke my arm once.

01:10:01.721 --> 01:10:05.456
Is it hard to ride, you
know, with your pink cast?

01:10:05.458 --> 01:10:06.692
No, not really.

01:10:06.694 --> 01:10:08.196
Braking's hard.

01:10:09.596 --> 01:10:11.432
My mom used to have a Schwinn bike.

01:10:12.132 --> 01:10:14.098
This is my mom's bike.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.500
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:16.970
Oh, no way.

01:10:17.438 --> 01:10:18.440
That's cute.

01:10:21.408 --> 01:10:23.178
You really don't think it's weird?

01:10:24.244 --> 01:10:25.313
What?

01:10:27.448 --> 01:10:28.783
That John...

01:10:29.716 --> 01:10:31.650
He fell.

01:10:31.652 --> 01:10:33.718
People fuck around on
the bridge all the time.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.486
It just makes sense
that someone would fall.

01:10:35.488 --> 01:10:37.022
Yeah, but...

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:38.460
What if he didn't fall?

01:10:43.229 --> 01:10:44.298
Oh, my God.

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.435
You think he jumped?

01:10:51.171 --> 01:10:52.771
I don't know.

01:10:52.773 --> 01:10:54.071
Maybe. It means you're right.

01:10:54.073 --> 01:10:56.241
It's not weird I guess, right?

01:10:56.243 --> 01:10:58.143
Why do you care so much?

01:10:58.145 --> 01:11:00.849
God. Wow, I sound like such a dick.

01:11:01.715 --> 01:11:03.048
Don't I?

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:05.983
Why do you care so much a
kid in our class is dead?

01:11:05.985 --> 01:11:08.653
And that kid Daryl's still missing.

01:11:08.655 --> 01:11:11.956
I'm sorry. I don't mean to keep
bringing it up either. It's just...

01:11:11.958 --> 01:11:14.194
I don't really feel like I have
anyone to talk to right now.

01:11:14.962 --> 01:11:16.464
It's my fault, isn't it?

01:11:19.399 --> 01:11:21.268
Um, what?

01:11:23.636 --> 01:11:25.571
You and Josh?

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:27.940
I mean, I could tell you two were...

01:11:27.942 --> 01:11:29.344
Well, he's got a thing for me.

01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:35.016
I like you, Zach.

01:11:36.649 --> 01:11:37.951
A lot sometimes.

01:11:44.524 --> 01:11:45.926
Well, this is me.

01:11:47.694 --> 01:11:48.929
You already knew that.

01:11:53.868 --> 01:11:55.136
Do you wanna come inside?

01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:18.926
Hey, Mom.

01:12:26.466 --> 01:12:28.036
Mom, are you home?

01:12:37.912 --> 01:12:40.912
<i>Hey, honey. I'm gonna
be home a little late,</i>

01:12:40.914 --> 01:12:44.016
<i>so eat whatever you feel
like and don't go anywhere.</i>

01:12:44.018 --> 01:12:45.549
<i>I'll be home as soon as I can.</i>

01:12:45.551 --> 01:12:46.920
<i>Love you.</i>

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:49.122
<i>Bye.</i>

01:14:06.699 --> 01:14:08.036
Oh, shit.

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.350
- Hey.
- <i>Hey, it's Zach.</i>

01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:26.019
<i>So, could I have that number?</i>

01:14:26.487 --> 01:14:27.620
What number?

01:14:27.622 --> 01:14:30.525
<i>Charlie... uh, Carol
Barth. Her number.</i>

01:14:31.792 --> 01:14:33.892
Uh, yeah.

01:14:33.894 --> 01:14:35.630
Okay, just one second.

01:14:36.596 --> 01:14:37.896
Asshole.

01:14:40.701 --> 01:14:42.170
Fuck. Fuck.

01:14:44.604 --> 01:14:45.736
Barth residence.

01:14:45.738 --> 01:14:46.974
Charlie, it's Zach.

01:14:47.807 --> 01:14:49.540
How did you get my number?

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:51.511
Don't worry about that
now, all right? Just listen.

01:14:52.979 --> 01:14:54.247
I think it's Josh.

01:14:55.248 --> 01:14:57.249
You think what's Josh?

01:14:57.251 --> 01:14:58.650
I think he killed John Whitcomb.

01:14:58.652 --> 01:15:00.117
<i>What the hell, Zach?</i>

01:15:00.119 --> 01:15:01.786
<i>No, I need to talk to somebody who
knows and you're the only one who does.</i>

01:15:01.788 --> 01:15:03.254
<i>So just like fucking let me
work this out, all right?</i>

01:15:03.256 --> 01:15:04.857
- What?
- Okay.

01:15:04.859 --> 01:15:07.325
So fuckin' Daryl gags at a bit of fuckin'
Josh's weed, and he loses his shit.

01:15:07.327 --> 01:15:10.094
<i>But then the other night, all of a
sudden, Josh just like gives it all away</i>

01:15:10.096 --> 01:15:11.595
<i>to some girl as a gift.</i>

01:15:11.597 --> 01:15:13.701
<i>But then he says he's gonna
sell some to John Whitcomb.</i>

01:15:14.967 --> 01:15:17.402
- So?
- So, like a fucking week ago,

01:15:17.404 --> 01:15:19.537
<i>Josh is talking about how much
he fucking hates John Whitcomb,</i>

01:15:19.539 --> 01:15:21.205
<i>and all of a sudden he's
gonna sell him weed?</i>

01:15:21.207 --> 01:15:23.474
<i>And then all of a sudden
John Whitcomb turns up dead</i>

01:15:23.476 --> 01:15:25.811
at the exact same fucking spot
where we were all hanging out?

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:28.513
<i>I mean, it's just a little too
fucking coincidental, don't you think?</i>

01:15:28.515 --> 01:15:30.781
All right, so he's
acting weird. So are you.

01:15:30.783 --> 01:15:31.817
So am I, probably.

01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:33.218
I know. But I couldn't
stop thinking about it.

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.019
So I decided to go out where Daryl is,

01:15:35.021 --> 01:15:36.120
<i>and it's fucking different.</i>

01:15:36.122 --> 01:15:37.522
Wait, wait, wait...

01:15:37.524 --> 01:15:39.857
You're saying you went back out there?

01:15:39.859 --> 01:15:43.260
- What the...
- The sword is gone.

01:15:43.262 --> 01:15:44.763
Someone took it. I looked, I checked.

01:15:44.765 --> 01:15:45.763
It's not fucking there.

01:15:45.765 --> 01:15:47.531
Someone has taken the sword.

01:15:47.533 --> 01:15:49.768
Why would you go back up to the woods?

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:51.702
You know that three people
know about that sword, right?

01:15:51.704 --> 01:15:53.071
You, me, and Josh.

01:15:53.073 --> 01:15:55.139
<i>And I don't think he
went out there alone.</i>

01:15:55.141 --> 01:15:57.008
- No.
- No.

01:15:57.010 --> 01:15:58.477
I think Josh did. I think he went there,

01:15:58.479 --> 01:16:00.178
<i>he took the sword, he
fucked with Daryl's body,</i>

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.914
<i>and then he went and pushed John
Whitcomb off the fucking bridge.</i>

01:16:02.916 --> 01:16:04.883
And now I have no idea where he is,

01:16:04.885 --> 01:16:07.552
<i>'cause he won't answer any
of my fucking phone calls.</i>

01:16:07.554 --> 01:16:09.053
It's so fucked up.

01:16:09.055 --> 01:16:10.589
<i>I know, man.</i>

01:16:10.591 --> 01:16:13.157
Why would you add all this extra
nonsense onto the situation?

01:16:13.159 --> 01:16:14.893
Isn't it bad enough as it is?

01:16:14.895 --> 01:16:17.696
<i>You are not listening, Charlie.</i>

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:18.897
Daryl is dead.

01:16:18.899 --> 01:16:20.232
Charlie, Charlie. Listen, all right?

01:16:20.234 --> 01:16:21.732
<i>Josh, or fucking somebody else,</i>

01:16:21.734 --> 01:16:23.768
they went up there, and
if they found Daryl alive,

01:16:23.770 --> 01:16:25.070
they fucking finished him off.

01:16:25.072 --> 01:16:26.705
And if they didn't and they found him dead,

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:28.740
well, then they were just fucking
hacking at his dead fucking body.

01:16:28.742 --> 01:16:30.107
What, so it was Josh?

01:16:30.109 --> 01:16:31.511
He's your friend, isn't he?

01:16:32.112 --> 01:16:34.044
Of course he is.

01:16:34.046 --> 01:16:36.046
Then why go out of your way

01:16:36.048 --> 01:16:37.315
to put this on him?

01:16:37.317 --> 01:16:39.116
Is this not concerning? I mean,
where is the fucking sword?

01:16:39.118 --> 01:16:40.218
- Do you have it?
- No.

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.452
Did you take it?

01:16:41.454 --> 01:16:43.021
How do we know you didn't take it?

01:16:43.023 --> 01:16:44.789
How do we know if it's even gone?

01:16:44.791 --> 01:16:47.224
You wanna take me back
out there and show me?

01:16:47.226 --> 01:16:48.727
Lure me back out there?

01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:50.327
<i>No thank you.</i>

01:16:50.329 --> 01:16:51.662
Charlie, you need to listen.

01:16:51.664 --> 01:16:54.167
<i>No, I don't. You need
to listen to yourself.</i>

01:16:55.101 --> 01:16:56.470
You're fucking losing it, dude.

01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:58.806
Don't call me again.

01:17:12.152 --> 01:17:13.554
Ah, shit!

01:17:14.787 --> 01:17:17.190
<i>I didn't want you to see this, Mama.</i>

01:17:26.166 --> 01:17:27.735
Look who I found.

01:17:28.868 --> 01:17:30.137
Yo.

01:17:31.971 --> 01:17:33.140
Hey.

01:17:34.507 --> 01:17:35.675
I got chicken.

01:17:38.212 --> 01:17:40.978
I already ate. You told me to eat whatever.

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:42.516
- Oh, I did?
- Yeah.

01:17:43.817 --> 01:17:47.184
Oh. Well, then we'll reheat.

01:17:47.186 --> 01:17:48.320
Josh, you want some chicken?

01:17:48.322 --> 01:17:49.856
I'm fine. I shouldn't stay long.

01:17:53.226 --> 01:17:55.363
- Do you wanna...
- Yeah.

01:17:57.497 --> 01:17:59.863
We're gonna be outside for a sec.

01:17:59.865 --> 01:18:01.469
- Don't go far.
- I won't.

01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:11.512
So what are you doing here?

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.816
I don't know, dude. Just hanging out.

01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:25.560
I'm sorry I ditched you at Allison's.

01:18:27.994 --> 01:18:30.831
Yeah, she was pretty bummed.

01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:38.870
What? What are you doing?
Are you like afraid of me now?

01:18:38.872 --> 01:18:41.309
No, I'm not afraid of
you. There's just some...

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:52.017
Josh, I went off to the woods again.

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:54.218
- What?
- Yeah, and I saw that someone took the sword.

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.419
Did you talk to Charlie?

01:18:55.421 --> 01:18:56.955
Obviously I fucking talked to Charlie.

01:18:56.957 --> 01:18:58.156
Okay, why are you yelling at me?

01:18:58.158 --> 01:18:59.391
I'm not... I wasn't yelling at you.

01:18:59.393 --> 01:19:00.458
- Yes, you were.
- I wasn't yelling.

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.896
Look... Okay, Josh, this is...

01:19:04.398 --> 01:19:06.330
Look, we need to be talking.

01:19:06.332 --> 01:19:07.499
Like really talking.

01:19:07.501 --> 01:19:09.134
Not like you showing
up at my house sometimes

01:19:09.136 --> 01:19:11.906
and bumping into each other
at a fucking party, like...

01:19:12.905 --> 01:19:14.305
We're friends.

01:19:14.307 --> 01:19:15.706
And I need my friend back, you know.

01:19:15.708 --> 01:19:17.174
Because we're in this shit together.

01:19:17.176 --> 01:19:18.343
Whose number is that?

01:19:18.345 --> 01:19:20.644
Josh, I'm willing to draw a line.

01:19:20.646 --> 01:19:22.613
Really. I'm willing to
fucking put everything,

01:19:22.615 --> 01:19:23.781
like what happened with Daryl,

01:19:23.783 --> 01:19:25.517
and what maybe happened
with John Whitcomb...

01:19:25.519 --> 01:19:27.785
What are you talking about what
happened with John Whitcomb?

01:19:27.787 --> 01:19:29.923
Lower your voice. My
mom is inside, all right?

01:19:30.756 --> 01:19:32.357
Look, I... We...

01:19:32.359 --> 01:19:35.363
We can forget about all that stuff and...

01:19:36.162 --> 01:19:37.829
Look, I know how you feel.

01:19:37.831 --> 01:19:41.465
No, you fucking don't
know how I feel, okay?

01:19:41.467 --> 01:19:43.201
All you fucking do is say a bunch of shit

01:19:43.203 --> 01:19:46.274
that you think sounds nice,
because you're scared all the time.

01:19:48.074 --> 01:19:49.342
Well, you're wrong.

01:19:50.476 --> 01:19:52.546
And you're wrong about me too.

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:12.032
He left?

01:20:13.699 --> 01:20:16.768
Wish you would have told
me. I could have driven him.

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:18.639
No, he can take care of himself.

01:20:22.641 --> 01:20:24.811
They found that Whitcomb boy.

01:20:27.012 --> 01:20:29.417
Daryl's still missing. It's just too much.

01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:33.621
I keep thinking if I was their mother...

01:20:36.722 --> 01:20:37.725
Come here.

01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:42.059
- Mom.
- Come here.

01:20:42.061 --> 01:20:43.730
Fucking hug me.

01:20:44.096 --> 01:20:45.398
Jesus.

01:20:55.007 --> 01:20:56.443
I love you, sweetie.

01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:58.512
I love you.

01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:04.952
<i>Don't hurt me, please!</i>

01:21:52.765 --> 01:21:53.768
Hello!

01:22:13.086 --> 01:22:14.088
Josh?

01:22:27.367 --> 01:22:28.601
Josh?

01:22:39.779 --> 01:22:40.815
Fuck.

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.888
Where did he put it?

01:22:48.387 --> 01:22:49.523
Where is it?

01:23:10.577 --> 01:23:12.480
Oh, you can't trick me.

01:23:29.328 --> 01:23:30.497
Oh, shit.

01:23:53.386 --> 01:23:54.922
- Hey.
- Hey, Josh.

01:23:55.622 --> 01:23:57.187
- Allison.
- Hey.

01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:58.224
How's it going?

01:23:59.391 --> 01:24:00.924
Fine.

01:24:00.926 --> 01:24:02.593
What's with the beach towel?

01:24:02.595 --> 01:24:03.930
It's a surprise.

01:24:05.164 --> 01:24:07.134
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

01:24:09.368 --> 01:24:10.837
You should come in.

01:24:12.037 --> 01:24:13.640
I'd love to.

01:24:18.811 --> 01:24:20.978
- What?
- Is Allison here?

01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:22.213
Who wants to know?

01:24:22.215 --> 01:24:24.382
I do.

01:24:24.384 --> 01:24:26.550
- A mess...
- Yeah. I know. Please don't do that right now.

01:24:26.552 --> 01:24:27.818
Right, so she's not here?

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:29.553
- Nah.
- So where is she?

01:24:29.555 --> 01:24:31.589
She left with the bitch
from down the street.

01:24:31.591 --> 01:24:32.760
What bitch?

01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:34.592
Meghan whatever.

01:24:34.594 --> 01:24:36.561
Okay. And where are they?

01:24:36.563 --> 01:24:38.129
Her house, I guess.

01:24:38.131 --> 01:24:39.199
Was there a guy with them?

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.331
Fuck off.

01:24:41.333 --> 01:24:43.336
No, please. You don't
understand. Right now you can't...

01:25:13.099 --> 01:25:15.034
Excuse me.

01:25:19.372 --> 01:25:21.842
Uh, you got a little something.

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.948
So?

01:25:28.414 --> 01:25:29.746
So, so.

01:25:29.748 --> 01:25:31.652
So, you went to that guy.

01:25:32.351 --> 01:25:33.686
How much and how much?

01:25:36.756 --> 01:25:38.759
This much and it's on the house.

01:25:40.225 --> 01:25:41.961
No fucking way.

01:25:43.529 --> 01:25:45.429
Your guy is awesome.

01:25:45.431 --> 01:25:47.033
Fuck that. I am the guy.

01:25:52.639 --> 01:25:53.841
You rule.

01:25:54.606 --> 01:25:56.042
Thank you.

01:25:57.476 --> 01:25:59.610
Zach isn't coming, is he?

01:25:59.612 --> 01:26:02.149
Uh, no. He can't make it, unfortunately.

01:26:03.449 --> 01:26:06.720
So what? More for us. Come on.

01:26:13.726 --> 01:26:15.796
- Alrighty.
- Alrighty.

01:26:16.462 --> 01:26:18.361
Ladies first.

01:26:18.363 --> 01:26:19.666
Thank you.

01:26:39.185 --> 01:26:40.387
Shit.

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:54.264
Meghan, your mom's Chardonnay is shit.

01:26:54.266 --> 01:26:56.733
Yeah, she's cheap for being so rich.

01:26:56.735 --> 01:26:58.238
Where did she get it from?

01:26:58.938 --> 01:27:00.204
Yeah.

01:27:00.206 --> 01:27:01.708
The gas station.

01:27:03.609 --> 01:27:04.976
Josh, don't.

01:27:04.978 --> 01:27:07.144
Sorry.

01:27:07.146 --> 01:27:08.716
Yeah, it's rude.

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:11.952
Sorry.

01:27:14.354 --> 01:27:15.919
Josh.

01:27:15.921 --> 01:27:17.388
- I'm good.
- You sure?

01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:18.156
Mm-hmm.

01:27:18.158 --> 01:27:19.589
I thought we were hanging out.

01:27:19.591 --> 01:27:20.860
We are.

01:27:24.863 --> 01:27:26.833
So, Josh, what's the surprise this time?

01:27:30.002 --> 01:27:32.005
What the fuck is that?

01:27:32.604 --> 01:27:33.704
It's a fucking sword.

01:27:33.706 --> 01:27:35.272
That's the surprise?

01:27:35.274 --> 01:27:36.641
That's the surprise.

01:27:36.643 --> 01:27:38.308
Can I see it?

01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:39.143
You're looking at it.

01:27:39.145 --> 01:27:41.115
No. Like, can I play with it?

01:27:49.255 --> 01:27:51.190
This is fucking awesome.

01:27:51.623 --> 01:27:53.193
Ooh! Okay.

01:27:57.363 --> 01:27:59.066
Meghan, you look like Zelda.

01:28:00.033 --> 01:28:03.201
Zelda's the princess.

01:28:03.203 --> 01:28:05.769
Oh. Sorry.

01:28:05.771 --> 01:28:08.041
Whatever, man. It's all the same anyway.

01:28:09.341 --> 01:28:12.011
That's not true. It's not all the same.

01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:15.545
Mm.

01:28:15.547 --> 01:28:16.916
The sun feels good.

01:28:17.817 --> 01:28:19.051
Let me see.

01:28:19.452 --> 01:28:20.454
No.

01:28:32.698 --> 01:28:33.866
You like that?

01:28:34.701 --> 01:28:36.203
It's fucking rad.

01:28:45.944 --> 01:28:47.213
All right. My turn.

01:30:38.490 --> 01:30:39.525
Josh.

01:30:42.328 --> 01:30:44.932
Josh, you fucking fuck! Open the door!

01:30:46.932 --> 01:30:48.201
Josh!

01:30:54.373 --> 01:30:56.139
Help! Help!

01:30:56.141 --> 01:30:58.945
He's killing them! Help!

01:31:15.962 --> 01:31:17.331
Josh!

01:32:22.828 --> 01:32:24.128
I'm gonna go get help, all right?

01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:25.196
I'm gonna be right back.

01:32:25.198 --> 01:32:26.800
Just keep breathing, all right?

01:33:16.082 --> 01:33:17.484
Oh, shit!

01:33:25.024 --> 01:33:26.089
Josh!

01:33:53.519 --> 01:33:55.718
Josh, what the fuck are you doing?

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:56.889
Is she dead?

01:33:58.090 --> 01:34:00.360
Fuck you, man. What...

01:34:05.698 --> 01:34:08.799
Yo, what's happening? We're friends.

01:34:08.801 --> 01:34:10.337
Remember? We're...

01:34:12.171 --> 01:34:14.608
You're my... You're my best friend.

01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:18.645
Please...

01:34:19.545 --> 01:34:20.779
I love you.

01:34:22.614 --> 01:34:23.649
Fuck.

01:35:39.492 --> 01:35:41.991
Fuck! Get off him! Get off him!

01:35:41.993 --> 01:35:43.462
Move it! Stop it!

01:35:44.764 --> 01:35:45.798
Stop!

01:35:49.301 --> 01:35:50.769
Stay back... Get him...

01:36:25.637 --> 01:36:27.707
Zach, look at me. Look at me.

01:36:28.908 --> 01:36:31.008
One, two...

01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:32.576
Okay? What's hurting you?

01:36:32.578 --> 01:36:34.047
Here. It's hurting here.

01:36:36.181 --> 01:36:37.550
Can you hold that, please?

01:36:42.253 --> 01:36:44.888
Are they gonna be okay?

01:36:44.890 --> 01:36:46.522
Let me grab a pad for you.

01:36:46.524 --> 01:36:48.025
Are they gonna be okay?

01:36:48.027 --> 01:36:49.159
Keep looking at me, okay?

01:36:49.161 --> 01:36:50.396
Don't look away.

01:36:52.597 --> 01:36:54.932
Can you take a deep breath?

01:36:54.934 --> 01:36:56.469
Take a real nice one, okay?

01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:59.602
Zach, please.

01:36:59.604 --> 01:37:01.371
Can I have your attention
just for a minute?

01:37:01.373 --> 01:37:03.374
I just wanna ask you about what happened.

01:37:03.376 --> 01:37:05.375
Will that be okay with you?

01:39:28.052 --> 01:39:29.753
Who can tell me?

01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:31.621
Who knows? Raise your hand.

01:39:31.623 --> 01:39:35.491
Women's major contribution
to the industrial...

01:39:35.493 --> 01:39:37.294
Ah, Allison.
