00:04.510 --> 00:07.980
<b>Looks like you guys have been 
waiting here to kill me.</b>

00:08.470 --> 00:10.990
<b>Sorry, but the prey is about 
to become the predator.</b>

00:11.690 --> 00:15.450
<b>You'll die before you can even strike back.</b>

00:16.920 --> 00:17.970
<b>Really?</b>

00:19.450 --> 00:21.800
<b>I barely felt a thing.</b>

00:21.800 --> 00:26.500
<b>You could punch us like that a few 
thousand times without killing us.</b>

00:28.300 --> 00:29.910
<b>I get it.</b>

00:29.910 --> 00:31.900
<b>You're trying to act tough.</b>

00:38.010 --> 00:41.350
<b>You're swinging long after the ball's 
already in the catcher's mitt.</b>

00:41.780 --> 00:44.350
<b>Just as a warning, I'm not 
using my full strength.</b>

00:44.680 --> 00:46.970
<b>I can run faster and throw harder punches.</b>

00:51.400 --> 00:52.740
<b><i>This is a surprise.</i></b>

00:53.380 --> 00:56.280
<b><i>He's actually aiming for my face.</i></b>

00:57.790 --> 01:01.550
<b><i>I was certain his eyes couldn't 
even follow my motion earlier...</i></b>

01:02.070 --> 01:03.080
<b><i>Just a lucky guess?</i></b>

01:06.320 --> 01:07.040
<b><i>Him, too...</i></b>

01:07.750 --> 01:10.750
<b><i>He's clearly ascertaining where 
I'm going to be before he attacks.</i></b>

01:12.000 --> 01:14.550
<b><i>It's only been a minute since I encountered them.</i></b>

01:14.550 --> 01:17.550
<b><i>They've adapted to my speed that quickly?</i></b>

01:19.720 --> 01:22.310
<b><i>They're nothing like the guys from yesterday.</i></b>

01:23.260 --> 01:24.500
<b><i>How amusing...</i></b>

01:25.180 --> 01:27.560
<b><i>It makes this more of a challenge!</i></b>

02:57.030 --> 03:02.030
<b>Grudge x And x Dread</b>

03:03.340 --> 03:06.220
<b>Your bodies can't keep up with your minds...</b>

03:06.220 --> 03:08.510
<b>You obviously can't compete physically.</b>

03:08.510 --> 03:10.320
<b>How are you gonna compensate?</b>

03:10.320 --> 03:12.040
<b>With guns? Numbers?</b>

03:14.280 --> 03:16.170
<b>We'll use wit and experience.</b>

03:21.800 --> 03:24.130
<b><i>Where did this stuff come from?</i></b>

03:25.450 --> 03:27.410
<b><i>Smoke? Gas?</i></b>

03:27.700 --> 03:28.680
<b><i>Poison gas?</i></b>

03:28.680 --> 03:30.180
<b><i>Or sleeping gas?</i></b>

03:30.890 --> 03:34.070
<b><i>No, they're standing within it.</i></b>

03:34.070 --> 03:36.190
<b><i>This must be some kind of special power.</i></b>

03:36.920 --> 03:38.090
<b>Are you scared?</b>

03:38.960 --> 03:40.570
<b>You can retreat if you want.</b>

03:41.900 --> 03:44.430
<b>Does that mean you aren't running away?</b>

03:45.070 --> 03:47.080
<b><i>Then this is a smokescreen.</i></b>

03:47.640 --> 03:50.110
<b><i>They'll use it as cover for their attack.</i></b>

03:50.530 --> 03:53.520
<b><i>Well, let's see what they can do...</i></b>

03:55.470 --> 03:56.130
<b><i>Here it comes!</i></b>

03:59.510 --> 04:00.300
<b><i>What?</i></b>

04:07.510 --> 04:10.680
<b>When you use <i>Gyo</i>, your body freezes briefly.</b>

04:10.680 --> 04:13.560
<b>This trick won't work on the same 
opponent too many times.</b>

04:14.000 --> 04:15.560
<b>But it only needs to once.</b>

04:16.150 --> 04:17.490
<b>I wouldn't be so sure.</b>

04:17.490 --> 04:19.240
<b>That didn't hurt at all.</b>

04:19.240 --> 04:21.790
<b>I'll admit that you caught me off-guard,</b>

04:21.790 --> 04:24.750
<b>but you didn't do any damage.</b>

04:29.150 --> 04:30.330
<b>What's this?</b>

04:30.940 --> 04:33.230
<b>Gee, I wonder...</b>

04:34.080 --> 04:35.390
<b>It's time.</b>

04:35.390 --> 04:36.580
<b>Adding interest.</b>

04:38.160 --> 04:39.090
<b>Answer me.</b>

04:41.290 --> 04:42.550
<b>Answer me!</b>

04:46.700 --> 04:49.930
<b>Your anger is blinding you 
to your surroundings...</b>

04:50.530 --> 04:54.560
<b>It'll be super easy to send you tumbling.</b>

04:57.280 --> 04:59.640
<b>Hey! Damn it!</b>

05:02.540 --> 05:03.510
<b><i>They're gone?</i></b>

05:04.090 --> 05:05.240
<b>Where are you?</b>

05:05.840 --> 05:06.820
<b>It's time.</b>

05:07.400 --> 05:09.270
<b>Adding interest.</b>

05:14.380 --> 05:16.720
<b>It doesn't matter what your power does.</b>

05:17.090 --> 05:18.750
<b>I just have to rip you apart!</b>

05:27.320 --> 05:30.500
<b>Looks like he's powerless against <i>Zetsu</i>.</b>

05:30.500 --> 05:35.020
<b>Well, we're dealing with 
a level-one soldier ant.</b>

05:35.630 --> 05:39.520
<b>With APR on him, we can easily track him.</b>

05:40.020 --> 05:43.940
<b>We just need to chase him down, 
 box him in, and that'll be the end.</b>

05:43.940 --> 05:48.030
<b>But doesn't your ability lose its effect 
if the target moves too far away?</b>

05:48.690 --> 05:50.970
<b>It'll stop adding interest,</b>

05:50.970 --> 05:52.540
<b>but the effect will remain.</b>

05:52.990 --> 05:57.310
<b>Once I'm back in range, 
the counter will start up again.</b>

05:57.310 --> 06:00.830
<b>But even if IRS doesn't kick in, 
he'll be easy to finish off.</b>

06:00.830 --> 06:03.110
<b>We've already learned his attacks.</b>

06:03.110 --> 06:04.350
<b>You fool!</b>

06:04.780 --> 06:06.880
<b>We may know what pitch he'll use,</b>

06:06.880 --> 06:09.930
<b>but we still can't put the bat on the ball.</b>

06:10.580 --> 06:14.880
<b>Let's leave him for a <i>Nen</i> user who's 
better equipped to handle him.</b>

06:14.880 --> 06:15.930
<b>You're right.</b>

06:16.570 --> 06:19.020
<b>I'm more concerned about Gon and Killua...</b>

06:25.370 --> 06:26.930
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

06:26.930 --> 06:29.430
<b><i>I can't shake this thing.</i></b>

06:29.430 --> 06:31.450
<b><i>I can't outrun it...</i></b>

06:32.110 --> 06:33.450
<b><i>So this is </i>Nen<i>.</i></b>

06:34.470 --> 06:37.450
<b><i>I need more than just speed here.</i></b>

07:00.150 --> 07:02.320
<b>Kite's in here.</b>

07:02.730 --> 07:05.730
<b>He is no longer the person you once knew.</b>

07:06.810 --> 07:08.020
<b>It's okay.</b>

07:08.520 --> 07:10.740
<b>We'll find a way to cure him!</b>

07:15.780 --> 07:17.650
<b>Hotel Rafflesia...</b>

07:17.200 --> 07:24.250
<b>Hotel Rafflesia: 
Dark Inn</b>

07:18.280 --> 07:21.630
<b>Once I've dealt an enemy a 
certain amount of damage,</b>

07:21.630 --> 07:24.250
<b>I'm able to trap</b>

07:25.060 --> 07:27.450
<b>an entire body or merely a single part inside.</b>

07:31.260 --> 07:33.510
<b><i>This must be how he took my eye.</i></b>

07:56.490 --> 07:59.710
<b>If I release him from the cage, 
he'll return to his original size.</b>

08:00.520 --> 08:02.030
<b>Be careful.</b>

08:02.740 --> 08:06.790
<b>He cannot use <i>Nen</i>, but he is still strong.</b>

08:43.490 --> 08:44.540
<b>Kite...</b>

08:50.330 --> 08:55.050
<b>Most likely, they used him to train soldiers.</b>

08:56.530 --> 08:59.860
<b>He automatically attacks 
anyone who approaches.</b>

09:13.140 --> 09:14.160
<b>Kite...</b>

09:15.080 --> 09:16.400
<b>It's okay now.</b>

09:19.090 --> 09:20.390
<b>It's okay.</b>

09:49.920 --> 09:51.930
<b>It's been a while...</b>

09:53.010 --> 09:54.900
<b>since you punched me.</b>

10:00.190 --> 10:04.540
<b>That hurt a lot...</b>

10:19.460 --> 10:22.970
<b>You're going to let this beating continue?</b>

10:23.610 --> 10:26.390
<b>Gon can't use <i>Nen</i> to defend himself either, right?</b>

10:26.850 --> 10:29.720
<b>It's okay, Gon will notice.</b>

10:30.310 --> 10:33.420
<b>Maybe he already has,</b>

10:33.980 --> 10:35.030
<b>and is still...</b>

10:35.760 --> 10:37.030
<b>Perhaps.</b>

10:38.480 --> 10:43.910
<b>He's suppressing his reflexes to dodge or block,</b>

10:43.910 --> 10:46.570
<b>allowing himself to be hit.</b>

10:47.460 --> 10:49.160
<b><i>For real?</i></b>

10:49.160 --> 10:52.170
<b><i>Kite's attacks may be robotic 
and easy to anticipate.</i></b>

10:52.500 --> 10:56.980
<b><i>But Gon shouldn't be able to adapt 
so quickly in his current state!</i></b>

10:59.350 --> 11:02.890
<b><i>I'm sure he doesn't know what else to do.</i></b>

11:05.050 --> 11:09.020
<b><i>This is the reality we've created 
that we must now face.</i></b>

11:12.460 --> 11:13.850
<b><i>He'll go right next.</i></b>

11:16.000 --> 11:17.360
<b><i>Right again.</i></b>

11:18.490 --> 11:20.080
<b><i>And then left.</i></b>

11:21.460 --> 11:23.030
<b><i>Then a feint...</i></b>

11:25.810 --> 11:27.540
<b><i>He really does fight like a robot.</i></b>

11:29.540 --> 11:32.080
<b><i>Kite isn't this weak...</i></b>

11:33.410 --> 11:35.360
<b><i>Kite's punches</i></b>

11:35.940 --> 11:37.550
<b><i>hurt much more!</i></b>

11:52.260 --> 11:54.510
<b>I'm sorry, Kite.</b>

11:55.640 --> 11:58.590
<b>It's our fault you're like this...</b>

12:01.050 --> 12:03.890
<b>Get some rest.</b>

12:05.180 --> 12:07.330
<b>We'll take it from here.</b>

12:22.110 --> 12:23.510
<b>Level two...</b>

12:24.110 --> 12:26.250
<b>Gon can't see that thing,</b>

12:26.250 --> 12:28.850
<b>but it activates when anyone touches Kite.</b>

12:29.720 --> 12:34.320
<b>You must be highly skilled at 
combat to clear this test.</b>

12:35.260 --> 12:38.860
<b>I've already blocked Kite's <i>Nen</i>,</b>

12:39.480 --> 12:42.860
<b>so that belongs to whoever's controlling him.</b>

12:43.390 --> 12:44.710
<b>Be careful.</b>

12:45.140 --> 12:48.140
<b>If you touch him again, he'll attack.</b>

12:48.860 --> 12:50.130
<b>What do I do?</b>

12:51.320 --> 12:52.870
<b>How did you stop him?</b>

12:53.500 --> 12:56.880
<b>We injured him badly.</b>

12:57.990 --> 13:01.160
<b>We had no choice, but I'm still sorry.</b>

13:01.610 --> 13:04.880
<b>If you stay away, he won't attack.</b>

13:16.020 --> 13:17.110
<b>Kite...</b>

13:18.090 --> 13:19.940
<b>Just wait a little longer.</b>

13:26.630 --> 13:28.360
<b>I'll get you back to normal soon.</b>

13:40.150 --> 13:41.080
<b>Killua...</b>

13:43.380 --> 13:47.380
<b>I want that one myself!</b>

13:56.060 --> 13:57.140
<b>Killua...</b>

13:58.030 --> 14:00.760
<b>I knew something was different when I saw you.</b>

14:00.760 --> 14:05.690
<b>What did you guys do in the 
short time since I saw you last?</b>

14:07.280 --> 14:09.200
<b>We didn't do anything.</b>

14:10.060 --> 14:13.460
<b>Our enemies did.</b>

14:16.960 --> 14:19.710
<b>A Few Weeks Later</b>

14:20.180 --> 14:26.180
<b>Twenty-nine days have passed 
since Gon lost his <i>Nen</i>.</b>

14:26.890 --> 14:30.770
<b>Are you sure we should let them come along?</b>

14:31.170 --> 14:34.390
<b>We'll be breaking our promise to the old man.</b>

14:34.390 --> 14:36.180
<b>I see no problem with that.</b>

14:36.180 --> 14:40.470
<b>The test was to determine 
who would enter NGL...</b>

14:41.010 --> 14:45.430
<b>And we are headed to the 
Republic of East Gorteau.</b>

14:46.180 --> 14:48.990
<b>Sounds like a technicality to me.</b>

14:49.520 --> 14:52.410
<b>Then you think we shouldn't bring them with us?</b>

14:52.410 --> 14:55.740
<b>No, they're grown tigers now.</b>

14:56.600 --> 15:00.540
<b>They can take care of themselves.</b>

15:01.860 --> 15:03.620
<b>I would agree that Killua is capable,</b>

15:03.620 --> 15:05.380
<b>but what about Gon?</b>

15:06.340 --> 15:10.510
<b>At the very end, I was impressed 
by the way he moved.</b>

15:11.240 --> 15:15.150
<b>But he hasn't shown any fire since.</b>

15:16.070 --> 15:19.800
<b>And he clearly isn't focused during training.</b>

15:20.300 --> 15:24.240
<b>I believe his performance is quite inconsistent.</b>

15:24.240 --> 15:27.990
<b>But he's consistently inconsistent.</b>

15:28.670 --> 15:33.310
<b>He only gets serious when he absolutely must.</b>

15:33.310 --> 15:38.000
<b>I think his lack of drive these past few 
weeks will actually give him a boost.</b>

15:38.000 --> 15:39.450
<b>A boost?</b>

15:39.450 --> 15:41.750
<b>He's been saving up all that energy...</b>

15:42.680 --> 15:47.760
<b>To unleash when he finds his hated foe.</b>

15:48.260 --> 15:51.730
<b>Well, we'll see soon enough.</b>

15:51.730 --> 15:54.510
<b>Tomorrow, Gon's <i>Nen</i> will return...</b>

15:55.420 --> 15:57.280
<b>And the enemy is before us!</b>

15:59.060 --> 16:02.270
<b>Near the Republic of East Gorteau Border</b>

16:07.020 --> 16:10.290
<b><i>What is the agenda behind 
the sudden flurry of activity</i></b>

16:10.290 --> 16:12.820
<b><i>recently observed in East Gorteau?</i></b>

16:13.230 --> 16:16.030
<b><i>Supreme Leader Diego has personally invited</i></b>

16:16.030 --> 16:17.790
<b><i>all citizens to gather in the capital city,</i></b>

16:17.790 --> 16:22.420
<b><i>Peijing, to celebrate the 
nation's birth in ten days.</i></b>

16:22.890 --> 16:26.580
<b><i>Yes, there have been occasions 
in the past during which</i></b>

16:26.580 --> 16:28.300
<b><i>all citizens were invited to participate.</i></b>

16:28.770 --> 16:33.090
<b><i>However, we've never seen 
anything on this scale,</i></b>

16:33.090 --> 16:35.050
<b><i>where practically every citizen,</i></b>

16:35.600 --> 16:41.340
<b><i>from babies to the ill, has been summoned 
for a celebration spanning three days.</i></b>

16:42.060 --> 16:47.310
<b><i>The logical conclusion would be that 
the goal this time is different.</i></b>

16:47.850 --> 16:50.570
<b><i>What do you believe the goal to be?</i></b>

16:50.850 --> 16:53.960
<b><i>Well, it would send a powerful message</i></b>

16:53.960 --> 16:59.080
<b><i>if he were to announce his successor 
and abdication simultaneously.</i></b>

16:59.080 --> 17:04.580
<b><i>But I find it hard to imagine the Supreme 
Leader relinquishing his power.</i></b>

17:05.060 --> 17:10.840
<b><i>It may also be meant to distract 
from some other matter.</i></b>

17:11.540 --> 17:16.530
<b><i>In any event, the whole world will be 
watching East Gorteau in ten days.</i></b>

17:16.530 --> 17:17.270
<b><i>Next...</i></b>

17:17.270 --> 17:23.350
<b>Colt believes the celebration 
will be used as a screening.</b>

17:24.460 --> 17:28.300
<b>We don't know what they'll do 
with those found to have <i>Nen</i>,</b>

17:28.300 --> 17:32.490
<b>but ninety-nine percent of 
the humans there will die.</b>

17:33.700 --> 17:35.740
<b>We must stop it before that happens!</b>

17:36.540 --> 17:38.160
<b>Our time limit is ten days.</b>

17:39.210 --> 17:41.740
<b>What's the old man up to?</b>

17:42.330 --> 17:46.740
<b>He sent an e-mail saying that he's 
already inside East Gorteau,</b>

17:47.280 --> 17:49.290
<b>but I haven't heard from him since.</b>

17:49.700 --> 17:52.500
<b>Do you think he's been taken out?</b>

17:53.260 --> 17:57.590
<b>If he fails to contact us today,</b>

17:57.590 --> 18:00.510
<b>we've been told to assume as much.</b>

18:07.210 --> 18:09.770
<b>Speak of the devil, it's the Chairman.</b>

18:10.730 --> 18:14.290
<b>That old man's got some sharp ears...</b>

18:15.090 --> 18:17.040
<b>He already knows everything.</b>

18:17.480 --> 18:19.780
<b>Including the fact that you boys are here.</b>

18:20.790 --> 18:22.850
<b>And that Morel-san is badmouthing him.</b>

18:24.160 --> 18:29.340
<b><i>Divide into three pairs and draw the 
Royal Guard away from the King.</i></b>

18:29.340 --> 18:32.390
<b><i>The night before the celebration, 
the operation will begin at midnight.</i></b>

18:33.270 --> 18:35.770
<b><i>From the sharp-eared old man.</i></b>

18:36.320 --> 18:39.100
<b>That guy really scares me...</b>

18:44.180 --> 18:49.300
<b>I'm sorry to say that your thirty days are up.</b>

18:49.300 --> 18:52.070
<b>So I'll make myself scarce!</b>

18:52.070 --> 18:53.430
<b>See you around...</b>

18:53.430 --> 18:55.190
<b>Bye!</b>

19:00.060 --> 19:03.540
<b>Okay, now you can use <i>Nen</i> again.</b>

19:04.200 --> 19:05.580
<b>Give it a try.</b>

19:08.210 --> 19:09.090
<b>Gon...</b>

19:10.240 --> 19:13.890
<b>Sorry, but I'm still not convinced 
we should keep you around.</b>

19:15.110 --> 19:17.590
<b>Show me your resolve.</b>

19:19.340 --> 19:22.400
<b>Attack me as if I were responsible for Kite.</b>

19:22.930 --> 19:28.580
<b>If your attack is too weak, we'll replace 
you with another Hunter.</b>

19:29.480 --> 19:32.470
<b><i>Seriously, the master can be so difficult.</i></b>

19:32.470 --> 19:34.730
<b><i>He already agreed to bring Gon along...</i></b>

19:35.190 --> 19:39.280
<b>Gon, show him your Jajanken.</b>

19:44.170 --> 19:45.740
<b>You want me to attack you for real?</b>

19:46.020 --> 19:47.570
<b>Don't insult me!</b>

19:47.570 --> 19:51.190
<b>If you hold back in the slightest, 
you're off the team!</b>

19:51.800 --> 19:52.850
<b>Got it.</b>

20:30.320 --> 20:33.360
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

20:52.790 --> 20:53.790
<b>Gon,</b>

20:54.820 --> 20:56.400
<b>that's enough...</b>

20:59.270 --> 21:00.670
<b>Right, big guy?</b>

21:01.430 --> 21:03.400
<b>Y-Yeah...</b>

21:05.480 --> 21:06.410
<b>Oh.</b>

21:06.410 --> 21:08.620
<b>K-Killua, thank you.</b>

21:09.090 --> 21:10.660
<b>Sorry about that, Morel-san!</b>

21:11.390 --> 21:13.790
<b>I was really about to kill you!</b>

21:21.000 --> 21:23.380
<b>You got me... You got me good.</b>

21:23.380 --> 21:26.750
<b>You go crazy with the best of them.</b>

21:27.380 --> 21:29.240
<b>We'll split up now.</b>

21:30.190 --> 21:33.290
<b>Use whatever means you deem 
best to fulfill your mission.</b>

21:34.730 --> 21:38.310
<b>Gon and Killua, as you requested, 
you're assigned to Neferpitou.</b>

21:39.330 --> 21:43.320
<b>Knuckle and Shoot, you're on the 
one called Menthuthuyoupi.</b>

21:44.140 --> 21:46.550
<b>Knov and I will take Shaiapouf.</b>

21:47.290 --> 21:48.570
<b>Best of luck to you.</b>

21:51.600 --> 21:56.040
<b>The preparations for the final 
battles are complete.</b>

21:56.600 --> 21:59.780
<b>Ten days remain until that moment.</b>

23:24.840 --> 23:27.240
<b>Next time: A x Lawless x Home.</b>

23:27.240 --> 23:28.610
<b>Wanna see what being controlled is like?</b>

23:28.610 --> 23:29.540
<b>Huh?</b>

23:29.540 --> 23:31.280
<b>Stick this antenna here...</b>

23:31.280 --> 23:32.180
<b>Huh?</b>

23:32.180 --> 23:34.270
<b>It has to be Killua.</b>
