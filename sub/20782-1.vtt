We weren't expecting you until the 20th.

That's why they call them
"surprise visits," Colonel.

06:39.005 --> 06:40.259
Thought I'd come see for myself.

See if it's worth all that BS
you've been shoving up the hill.

people can do anything with their minds yet.

For the very latest,
let's check in with our reporter,

16:36.802 --> 16:39.024
who's live near where the epicenter struck.

16:39.104 --> 16:41.727
We're in the small town of
Mojave, California.

16:41.807 --> 16:44.997
We just arrived on scene,
and you can see right behind me,

16:45.077 --> 16:46.698
major devastation.

16:46.778 --> 16:48.400
We know multiple people have died,

16:48.480 --> 16:50.536
but officials remain very tightlipped

16:50.616 --> 16:51.904
on what's going on here.

16:51.984 --> 16:55.841

Again, we're still waiting
for information on the death toll.

you can see major devastation.

Can you tell me what happened?

17:11.589 --> 17:13.459
- Please, not now, please.
- Are you okay?

17:13.539 --> 17:15.928
- Please, not now.
- Step away. Please step away.

17:16.008 --> 17:18.864
There was a tornado.
Can you not see the results?

17:18.944 --> 17:21.066
But then all of a sudden,
something exploded in the back,

17:21.146 --> 17:23.001
(STAMMERING) and it was... I...

17:23.080 --> 17:24.936

Never. I've never experienced
anything like this before.

earthquake and they saw lightning strikes.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.680
- Did you see that, too?
- I saw lightning strikes.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.535
How are you doing?

17:37.262 --> 17:38.584
I'm a little shaken.

17:38.664 --> 17:40.919
So, what was it exactly?

17:40.999 --> 17:43.088
I really... I couldn't even tell you.

There was no wind at all,

17:49.841 --> 17:51.697

there's just a big gust.

No.

I don't know. I just...

18:38.490 --> 18:40.129
I'm so sorry, Cassie.

General, I don't understand.

19:07.886 --> 19:10.457
Well, you get paid to do so, Colonel.

19:15.727 --> 19:17.206

we were honest with each other.

- Yes?
- May I have a word with you?

Sure.

- I'm handling.

20:32.504 --> 20:36.094
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

20:36.174 --> 20:38.484
Are you really, really sure?

20:38.577 --> 20:41.867
- What are you trying to say, Colonel?
- Well, you're the seer.

20:41.947 --> 20:43.449
Why don't you tell me what's on my mind?

20:46.418 --> 20:48.740
You signed up for this.

20:48.820 --> 20:50.942
You volunteered for this.

20:51.022 --> 20:53.211
And I need you.
You're the leader of this group.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.981
These other people, they look up to you.

20:56.061 --> 20:57.472
You're the seer.

20:58.764 --> 21:02.921
And unfortunately, there's some bad things
that have to happen along the way.

21:03.001 --> 21:05.957
But think of the good, think of
the good that you can do for this world.

21:06.037 --> 21:08.493
I did not sign up to destroy cities.

21:08.573 --> 21:12.397
But did you sign up to save people?

21:12.477 --> 21:15.067
To save little children from tsunamis

21:15.147 --> 21:17.069
and famine?

21:17.149 --> 21:19.186
And earthquake?

21:20.152 --> 21:23.842
That's the good that you have
within your ability.

21:23.922 --> 21:27.079
But you gotta stay strong.

21:27.159 --> 21:29.848
You can't crack under this pressure.

21:29.928 --> 21:32.617
Hey, you're in charge, Colonel.

21:32.697 --> 21:34.252
I did sign up for this, right?

21:34.332 --> 21:36.972
Yes, ma'am, you did, and I need you.

21:38.303 --> 21:40.340
That'll be all.

21:41.306 --> 21:43.115
And thank you.

22:13.071 --> 22:15.381
MAN: (ECHOING) Jenny, what did you do?

22:25.684 --> 22:28.597
- (MAN YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
- Stop, Dad! Stop!

22:38.163 --> 22:41.186
They're reporting nearly 700 dead.

22:41.266 --> 22:44.556
There's no sign of anything
happening at the target site.

22:44.636 --> 22:46.591
We're going through every record,

22:46.671 --> 22:50.395
but so far, we haven't found the problem.

22:50.475 --> 22:52.164
Don't blame yourselves.

22:52.244 --> 22:53.999
This is not your fault.

22:54.079 --> 22:56.701
Satellite targeting must've been off.

22:56.781 --> 22:58.670
We all saw your visualization.

22:58.750 --> 23:03.290
Jennifer guided us in right to the mock town.

23:04.923 --> 23:06.845
Look, we know it works.

23:06.925 --> 23:08.847
General White will keep the project going.

23:08.927 --> 23:10.682
We just need to work out the bugs.

23:10.762 --> 23:13.618
The bugs? There were people.

23:13.698 --> 23:17.222
You all don't wanna know how many lives were
sacrificed during the Manhattan Project.

23:17.302 --> 23:20.926
How many phases. How many failures.

23:21.006 --> 23:25.263
We're doing something that's never been
done before in the history of mankind.

23:25.343 --> 23:28.449
And this is the hard reality
to bring good to the masses.

23:31.082 --> 23:32.561
The price is heavy.

23:35.554 --> 23:36.942
Get some rest.

23:37.022 --> 23:39.901
You got a big day ahead of you tomorrow.

23:41.593 --> 23:46.167
And there's no base leave
until we get this figured out.

23:48.266 --> 23:50.508
Is that understood?

23:52.103 --> 23:53.605
Great.

23:54.573 --> 23:56.985
Good night.

24:04.015 --> 24:05.585
Well, this sucks.

24:06.651 --> 24:09.341
How'd they mess us up?

24:09.421 --> 24:11.025
Hey, you okay?

24:11.890 --> 24:13.345
It was him.

24:13.425 --> 24:15.247
He's not a TK.

24:15.327 --> 24:16.748
- Get off.
- Why?

24:16.828 --> 24:18.850
He probably just wanted a show
for the Pentagon.

24:18.930 --> 24:20.819
No, there was definitely a presence there.

24:20.899 --> 24:23.154
- Yeah.
- That survivor,

24:23.234 --> 24:26.873
the one I saw right before we pulled
the plug, he means something.

24:28.173 --> 24:30.662
And I think we need to
keep an eye on Clayton.

24:30.742 --> 24:33.131
I think we need to keep an eye on each other.

24:33.211 --> 24:35.367
You heard what he said.

24:35.447 --> 24:37.202
We're all prisoners here.

24:37.282 --> 24:40.038
(YAWNS) Well, uh, this prisoner is tired.

24:40.118 --> 24:41.973
- I'm out. Deuces.
- Yeah.

24:42.053 --> 24:44.693
Yeah, I need a smoke. I need a smoke break.

24:46.191 --> 24:47.636
Are you leaving?

24:55.700 --> 24:59.546
- You all right, honey?
- No, Gertie, probably not.

25:00.872 --> 25:03.318
I don't think any of us are gonna be okay.

Stop the vehicle right now! Stop!

28:01.219 --> 28:03.722
Stop! Stop right now! Stop!

29:09.320 --> 29:11.425
I know you're here.

29:13.825 --> 29:16.067
You looking for something?

29:17.161 --> 29:18.449
It's you.

29:18.529 --> 29:20.907
What? Do we know each other?

29:21.933 --> 29:23.955
I think we kinda do.

29:24.035 --> 29:25.514
Who are you?

29:26.571 --> 29:28.016
You look so familiar.

29:28.973 --> 29:31.062
You were at the diner, back in town.

29:31.142 --> 29:33.064
No, but I know what happened.

29:33.144 --> 29:34.499
Yeah, everyone knows what happened.

29:34.579 --> 29:38.169
No, it's not like that.
I know more. I know why.

29:38.249 --> 29:39.971

Who are you?

30:21.859 --> 30:23.498
(GASPS)

30:36.541 --> 30:39.579
- Oh, my God.
- How did we miss you?

30:41.312 --> 30:43.868
- Did I hit you?
- You threw me.

30:43.948 --> 30:46.337
What? Wait a minute, who's "we"?

30:46.417 --> 30:49.173
- What do you mean we missed you?
- You are TK.

30:49.253 --> 30:51.542
- Just like me.
- "TK"?

30:51.622 --> 30:53.478
Telekinetic.

30:53.558 --> 30:55.060
You threw me with your mind.

30:58.229 --> 31:00.018
- Where are we?
- Looks safe.

31:00.098 --> 31:01.839
Hidden.

31:02.734 --> 31:04.923
- Who are you?
- Jennifer.

31:05.003 --> 31:08.280
- And you're Adam.
- How did you know who I am?

31:12.510 --> 31:14.165
Oh, my God.

31:14.245 --> 31:15.667
- No, not again.
- What? What's going on?

31:15.747 --> 31:17.101
- Give me your phone.
- No. Why?

31:17.181 --> 31:18.717
Please, I need to see the news. Please.

31:23.921 --> 31:25.710
This is impossible.

31:25.790 --> 31:27.963
- Why would they do this?
- Who? Why would who do what?

31:32.296 --> 31:36.120
Following up now on a string of earthquakes
that struck the California desert.

31:36.200 --> 31:39.590
It seems the entire Western seaboard
is now on high alert.

31:39.670 --> 31:43.094
Reports coming in out of
San Francisco of a 9.8 earthquake.

31:43.174 --> 31:47.398
And also unconfirmed reports have
the death toll currently in the thousands.

31:47.478 --> 31:48.633
Keep it right here with us.

31:48.713 --> 31:51.216
We'll be sure to give you more details
as soon as they become available.

31:53.818 --> 31:55.206
You wanna tell me what the hell is going on?

31:55.286 --> 31:57.075
We just lost San Francisco.

31:57.155 --> 31:59.043
- Sir.
- What is it, soldier?

31:59.123 --> 32:00.545
She's nowhere to be found on base.

32:00.625 --> 32:03.381
A few of the guys heard some noise
last night, now a vehicle is missing.

32:03.461 --> 32:05.249
All of the vehicles have GPS.

32:05.329 --> 32:07.085
- I'll find her.
- Then what in the hell

32:07.165 --> 32:08.486
- are you waiting for?
- Let me get this straight.

32:08.566 --> 32:10.722
You're telling me that this is
all caused by one woman?

32:10.802 --> 32:12.890
You categorically told me,
Colonel, that this machine

32:12.970 --> 32:15.326
cannot operate without the group,
so what the hell is it?

32:15.406 --> 32:18.615
Jennifer would never be involved
in something like this.

32:20.411 --> 32:22.100
Okay, let's get things straight.

32:22.180 --> 32:24.402
Targeting goes haywire,
she goes missing, then this.

32:24.482 --> 32:27.338
- Now, who the hell is this guy?
- He's in Mojave.

32:27.418 --> 32:30.842
Not a scratch on him,
all fires raining down on that town.

32:30.922 --> 32:33.244
They're in this together.

32:33.324 --> 32:35.413
You saw the way that she reacted to him.

32:35.493 --> 32:37.682
I'm telling you,
Jennifer Gaines has gone rogue.

32:37.762 --> 32:40.685
She has been acting kinda weird lately.

32:40.765 --> 32:42.653
Why, Rick, because she's not falling for you?

32:42.733 --> 32:44.655
- No...
- Then you explain it!

32:44.735 --> 32:46.124
She's the seer!

32:46.204 --> 32:48.292
And she focuses all of your powers.

32:48.372 --> 32:51.596
- I can focus my damn self.
- No, no.

32:51.676 --> 32:54.532
We can all do our own thing,
but she's the antenna.

32:54.612 --> 32:56.267
- We can't...
- Is that right?

32:56.347 --> 32:59.103
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.

32:59.183 --> 33:00.838
- Colonel.
- Yes.

33:00.918 --> 33:03.307
Sounds to me like this operation
is compromised.

33:03.387 --> 33:05.376
All systems to be downed
effective immediately.

33:05.456 --> 33:06.978
Nobody goes in or out of this facility.

33:07.058 --> 33:09.047
And no one plugs in, is that clear?

33:09.127 --> 33:10.504
And that includes you, Colonel.

33:11.863 --> 33:14.519
Security Chief,
we're gonna need a six-man team.

33:14.599 --> 33:17.288
No footprint, no fatalities,
bring 'em in alive.

33:17.368 --> 33:19.457
We get the girl, TK or no TK.

33:19.537 --> 33:20.880
Colonel.

33:23.708 --> 33:26.314
- Anything?
- No, sir.

33:27.078 --> 33:29.684
Stay away from that machine.

33:30.348 --> 33:32.191
Let's go.

34:44.956 --> 34:47.043
And you expect me to believe
all this just like that?

34:47.123 --> 34:50.380
You just tossed me across the room
and you can't believe I'm psychic?

34:50.460 --> 34:52.483
- (SCOFFS)
- Okay, put your hands

34:52.563 --> 34:54.485
behind your back and hold out
as many fingers as you want.

34:54.565 --> 34:56.087
Are you serious?

34:56.167 --> 34:57.889
Do it.

34:57.969 --> 34:59.141
Whatever.

35:00.204 --> 35:02.126
Two.

35:02.206 --> 35:03.427
Three.

35:03.507 --> 35:05.429
Five.

35:05.509 --> 35:07.284
I can do this all day.

35:08.779 --> 35:10.434
- Very funny.
- (SCOFFS)

35:10.514 --> 35:13.404
Magicians do this all the time.
There's always a trick involved.

35:13.484 --> 35:16.007
You know, I totally thought
you'd be more open-minded than this,

35:16.087 --> 35:17.327
but hard it is, then.

35:21.092 --> 35:23.436
What the hell? You could've killed me!

35:25.196 --> 35:26.450
No, I couldn't of.

35:26.530 --> 35:30.021
Things like that have been happening
around your whole life, right?

35:30.101 --> 35:31.307
Right?

35:32.770 --> 35:34.258
You're TK.

35:34.338 --> 35:36.928
Your subconscious
will protect you no matter what.

35:37.008 --> 35:39.530
What's this, like some kind of mutant thing?

35:39.610 --> 35:41.799
- Like the comic books?
- (CHUCKLES)

35:41.879 --> 35:44.135
Yeah, that's kinda what this is.

35:44.215 --> 35:47.628
I'm a seer, but you could do
a whole lot more than that.

35:56.827 --> 35:58.482
Are you freaking crazy?

35:58.562 --> 36:00.872
Test passed. You knew it was coming.

36:02.166 --> 36:03.543
Something's wrong.

36:11.175 --> 36:14.398
- (GASPS) Oh, my God, they're here.
- Who's here? What are you talking about?

36:14.478 --> 36:15.666
- Strike Team.
- What's "Strike Team"?

36:15.746 --> 36:17.802
- We gotta go. Come on.
- All right, let's go.

36:17.882 --> 36:19.327
No, no, this way.

37:33.824 --> 37:35.303
Hold.

38:35.352 --> 38:37.942
Don't move!

38:38.022 --> 38:41.278
- We're taking you back.
- It's not happening.

38:41.358 --> 38:42.847
Hell I can't.

38:42.927 --> 38:44.804
Not going back.

- Long story. We gotta go.
- How am I doing all this?

39:59.970 --> 40:01.592
Can't explain it now. We were all trained.

40:01.672 --> 40:03.461

- He's using them somehow.

- Do as he says.

you will come back in with me.

40:28.399 --> 40:29.969

On your knees, now!

41:12.943 --> 41:15.165
- Holy shit.
- I know.

41:15.245 --> 41:16.315
Let's go.

41:25.222 --> 41:27.211
- We need to get out of here.
- L.A.

41:27.291 --> 41:28.946
It's easy to disappear.

41:29.026 --> 41:30.630
We gotta go. They tracked you here.

41:33.697 --> 41:35.486
- What are you doing?
- They can probably track

41:35.566 --> 41:38.155
my cell phone, too, you know,
triangulate the signal or whatever.

41:38.235 --> 41:40.078
Yeah, they don't need
your cell phone to do that.

There you go!

56:07.170 --> 56:09.047
You gonna help me up there, cowboy?

56:10.840 --> 56:13.343
- You all right?
- Yeah.

56:14.844 --> 56:18.334
- Nice work.
- I didn't know I could do that.

56:18.414 --> 56:19.903
This ends now.

56:19.983 --> 56:22.190
You see a clear shot, you take them down.

56:23.720 --> 56:26.009
Hey, man, you ready?

56:26.089 --> 56:29.070
Don't punk out on me, man.
Remember, they'd do the same to us.

56:30.560 --> 56:33.516
And you two, you pull that
hippie bleeding-heart crap,

56:33.596 --> 56:35.303

56:35.398 --> 56:37.020
Rick, seriously, you're tripping.

56:37.100 --> 56:38.421
There's something else going on here, man.

56:38.501 --> 56:41.641
They killed millions, Ruben.
They're too dangerous to live.

56:41.738 --> 56:43.626
If you think Jennifer really did all this,

56:43.706 --> 56:45.982
then you really didn't know her
in the first place, did you?

56:46.876 --> 56:48.932
Get a clue, kid. They're using us.

56:49.012 --> 56:51.267
- She couldn't do this alone.
- Exactly.

56:51.347 --> 56:52.869
Okay, it's him.

56:52.949 --> 56:54.137
He's gotta go.

56:54.217 --> 56:57.062
Scratch that, they got to go.

57:09.299 --> 57:12.906
L.A.... gone.

57:14.571 --> 57:17.060
I can't believe Clayton would do this.

57:17.140 --> 57:19.086
All those people.

57:20.410 --> 57:22.185
Millions.

57:23.813 --> 57:26.336
How are they doing this without you?

57:26.416 --> 57:29.488
I don't know. We function in pairs.

57:29.986 --> 57:31.274
Rick is fire and air.

57:31.354 --> 57:33.610
He's connected to Clive, who does earth.

57:33.690 --> 57:36.679
Gertie's water, Ruben's lightning,
and they do their thing.

57:36.759 --> 57:38.815
I'm the seer, psychic.

57:38.895 --> 57:41.251
The one who harnesses it all
and aims their power.

57:41.331 --> 57:44.988

weather patterns hundreds of miles away.

57:45.068 --> 57:47.257
We all have a touch of
each others' abilities,

57:47.337 --> 57:48.658
but nothing major.

57:48.738 --> 57:50.843
Nothing like when I focus them.

57:51.808 --> 57:54.516
So, who's your pair?

57:57.847 --> 57:59.292
Me...

58:00.783 --> 58:04.040
Look, you're strong, I'm strong.

58:04.120 --> 58:06.476
But together, we're something different.

58:06.556 --> 58:09.679
They can't levitate things, alter reality,

58:09.759 --> 58:12.482
create force fields, but we can.

58:12.562 --> 58:15.236
I could always do it a little, but...

58:16.065 --> 58:18.788
Right before our town got hit,
I saved this lady.

58:18.868 --> 58:20.814
I tossed her truck across the yard.

58:21.738 --> 58:23.526
They were targeting your town that day.

58:23.606 --> 58:26.529
My sight was projected to your area.

58:26.609 --> 58:29.866
- And it made me stronger.
- It released your power.

58:29.946 --> 58:32.188
That's what the headaches were.

58:33.049 --> 58:36.326
They never could've anticipated
another TK like you.

58:38.221 --> 58:40.030
Guess it was fate.

58:40.723 --> 58:42.312
Maybe it was.

01:12:37.259 --> 01:12:39.569
Why don't you go ahead?
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:12:39.661 --> 01:12:41.617
Do the best you can. Go, go. (GIBBERISH)

01:12:41.697 --> 01:12:43.919
- You're losing it.
- Hmm.

01:12:43.999 --> 01:12:46.241
You're outta your mind, Colonel.

01:12:47.836 --> 01:12:49.658
Where are your friends, Ruben?

01:12:49.738 --> 01:12:51.560
They're running late.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.195
You was always a smartass.

01:12:53.275 --> 01:12:55.949
Yeah, and you were always a dick.

01:12:57.012 --> 01:12:58.367
Yeah, well, you know what,

01:12:58.447 --> 01:13:00.654
you can't stop this.

01:13:01.583 --> 01:13:03.272
None of you can.

01:13:03.352 --> 01:13:05.923
Because the system is online.

01:13:07.122 --> 01:13:10.078
You kill me, my mission completes.

01:13:10.158 --> 01:13:12.502
This is a New Age, son.

01:13:13.228 --> 01:13:14.883
That's it.

01:13:14.963 --> 01:13:16.943
(GRUNTS)

01:13:26.108 --> 01:13:28.520
We gotta rip it apart from the inside out.

01:13:49.565 --> 01:13:51.453
Funny thing about the system, son.

01:13:51.533 --> 01:13:53.945
Every time I used your cloned frequencies...

01:13:56.772 --> 01:13:59.895
I realized I brought back
just a little bit of the power...

01:13:59.975 --> 01:14:01.818
myself.

01:14:08.283 --> 01:14:10.422
Our brains adapt.

01:14:11.286 --> 01:14:13.960
They align to whatever
energy source surrounds it.

01:14:44.753 --> 01:14:46.475
Oh, my God, Ruben.

01:14:46.555 --> 01:14:48.899
It's Clayton. He's got him.

01:14:53.328 --> 01:14:55.638
Young fool.

01:14:56.765 --> 01:15:00.440
Only now at the end do you understand.

01:15:05.841 --> 01:15:07.218
Oh, Jennifer.

01:15:07.976 --> 01:15:09.665
You and the new TK.

01:15:09.745 --> 01:15:12.453
You're a little bit late,
because my mission is complete.

01:15:13.415 --> 01:15:16.225
Say good-bye to Washington.

01:15:17.319 --> 01:15:19.808
I surrender.

01:15:19.888 --> 01:15:21.810
Take me in.

01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:25.013
- You can stop this.
- No, I can't.

01:15:25.093 --> 01:15:29.217
We set this up to run on its own
the minute I sent the signal out.

01:15:29.297 --> 01:15:31.520
This can't be it. There has to be a way.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.222
- We destroyed the grid.
- But you didn't destroy the signal.

01:15:34.302 --> 01:15:36.792
Once you think a thought,
that thought leaves your mind.

01:15:36.872 --> 01:15:38.627
You can't get it back.

01:15:38.707 --> 01:15:41.496
You can't unthink a thought.

01:15:41.576 --> 01:15:43.699
It's out there.

01:15:43.779 --> 01:15:47.703
I was able to get a little of
everyone's abilities

01:15:47.783 --> 01:15:49.387
except for yours, Jennifer.

01:15:50.185 --> 01:15:54.109
I couldn't quite figure out
how to get the sight.

01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:56.226
That's because I never had my pair.

01:15:57.359 --> 01:15:59.381
That's right, and now you do.

01:15:59.461 --> 01:16:03.239
What a fitting end
to your sucky little love story.

01:16:27.723 --> 01:16:31.613
Well, welcome to the New Age.

01:16:31.693 --> 01:16:34.983
You go, or I go.

01:16:35.063 --> 01:16:37.100
It doesn't make any difference to me.

01:16:38.233 --> 01:16:40.889
Welcome to the revolution!

01:16:40.969 --> 01:16:42.278
(RUMBLING)

01:16:42.904 --> 01:16:45.976
(JENNIFER SHOUTS)

01:17:27.983 --> 01:17:29.671
We can stop Washington.

01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:31.306
That's halfway across the damn country.

01:17:31.386 --> 01:17:33.809
Not in your mind. I will guide us in.

01:17:33.889 --> 01:17:35.459
See what I see.

01:17:53.675 --> 01:17:55.831
- I can't.
- Focus.

01:17:55.911 --> 01:17:57.515
Calm your breathing.

01:17:59.614 --> 01:18:01.560
Together, okay?

01:18:06.488 --> 01:18:08.559
That kinda helped, I ain't gonna lie.

01:18:10.358 --> 01:18:12.861
- We can do this.
- All right.

01:18:23.805 --> 01:18:24.977
Fight it.

01:18:35.417 --> 01:18:37.397
(YELLING)

01:18:54.269 --> 01:18:56.224
- (GRUNTS)
- (PANTING)

01:18:56.304 --> 01:18:59.728
Is it over? Did you do it?
You save Washington?

01:18:59.808 --> 01:19:02.220
Oh, my God. Guys, this means we're heroes.

01:19:05.914 --> 01:19:07.689
Ruben!

01:19:15.357 --> 01:19:18.413
You should've finished it back on the hill.

01:19:18.493 --> 01:19:20.048
There is no one left.

01:19:20.128 --> 01:19:22.284
This is over.

01:19:22.364 --> 01:19:24.286
He used us.

01:19:24.366 --> 01:19:26.642
You think this is about Clayton?

01:19:27.469 --> 01:19:29.791
This is about you!

01:19:29.871 --> 01:19:33.228
- And him!
- It doesn't have to end like this.

01:19:33.308 --> 01:19:36.565
(CHUCKLES) Sure it does.

01:19:36.645 --> 01:19:39.701
System messed you up, Rick.
Messed with your mind.

01:19:39.781 --> 01:19:42.284
And we can find a way to move on,
can't you see?

01:19:44.953 --> 01:19:47.160
We could be gods.

01:19:48.723 --> 01:19:50.896
But there's only room for one.

01:20:48.316 --> 01:20:50.505
You took her from us!

01:20:50.585 --> 01:20:52.107
You took her from me!

01:20:52.187 --> 01:20:54.809
- Adam!
- You killed your own people.

01:20:54.889 --> 01:20:57.529
You killed... you tried to kill her!

01:21:05.367 --> 01:21:08.290
You wanna know why
I never fell for you, Rick?

01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:10.492
'Cause you were always an asshole.

01:21:10.572 --> 01:21:12.484
This ends now.

01:21:30.358 --> 01:21:32.395
(SCREAMING)

01:22:01.022 --> 01:22:04.446
Folks, wanna update you on the breaking
news we've been following all day long.

01:22:04.526 --> 01:22:06.681
Reports now coming in from Washington, D.C.,

01:22:06.761 --> 01:22:09.684
saying that city has seen
similar natural disasters

01:22:09.764 --> 01:22:11.052
that struck the West Coast.

01:22:11.132 --> 01:22:13.722
However, at this time, we do know
that most of Capitol Hill

01:22:13.802 --> 01:22:15.256
was evacuated at the time,

01:22:15.336 --> 01:22:18.360
and that the President and his
entire cabinet are safe at this moment,

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:21.096
but the White House did suffer major damage.

01:22:21.176 --> 01:22:24.966
Now, at first we were told by authorities
these events were a natural disaster.

01:22:25.046 --> 01:22:28.903
But we're getting unconfirmed reports
that these were terrorist attacks.

01:22:28.983 --> 01:22:30.572
Folks, I'm getting word from my producer.

01:22:30.652 --> 01:22:32.240
We're gonna go live now
to President Coronado,

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.376
who is in a safe and secure location.

01:22:34.456 --> 01:22:37.746
Let's listen in as our Commander-in-chief
addresses the nation.

01:22:37.826 --> 01:22:39.614
My fellow Americans,

01:22:39.694 --> 01:22:43.651
over the last two days, our country was
targeted and attacked by a terrorist.

01:22:43.731 --> 01:22:48.723
This attack was not done by a foreign
enemy but by a domestic one.

01:22:48.803 --> 01:22:52.227
Whether it was an entire organization
that infiltrated the U.S. government,

01:22:52.307 --> 01:22:54.729
or merely an evil man with a sick mission

01:22:54.809 --> 01:22:56.231
has yet to be determined.

01:22:56.311 --> 01:22:58.733
But what I do know is that
a special covert unit,

01:22:58.813 --> 01:23:00.802
lead by our own General Benjamin White,

01:23:00.882 --> 01:23:03.471
saved our city, and possibly our nation.

01:23:03.551 --> 01:23:06.174
Thank you, God bless America,

01:23:06.254 --> 01:23:08.777
and God bless the world.

01:23:08.857 --> 01:23:11.012
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:23:11.092 --> 01:23:12.480
Good day.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.516
There will be an extended
statement to follow,

01:23:14.596 --> 01:23:17.118
but of course we have a lot of data
and information to go through.

01:23:17.198 --> 01:23:20.121
What I can tell you is
because of our brave operatives

01:23:20.201 --> 01:23:21.990
and their unique skillsets,

01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:25.160
we were able to stop
these highly orchestrated attacks.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.961
We owe them our gratitude.

01:23:27.041 --> 01:23:30.532
I'm sure I speak for all of us when
I wish them a safe and speedy return.

01:23:30.612 --> 01:23:31.818
Wherever they are.

01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:43.978
Fast learner.

01:23:44.058 --> 01:23:47.015
- I'm getting the hang of it.
- You got a little potential.

01:23:47.095 --> 01:23:49.451
- (SCOFFS)
- (CHUCKLES)

01:23:49.531 --> 01:23:52.487
- Is that all?
- Okay, maybe more than just a little.

01:23:52.567 --> 01:23:55.013
