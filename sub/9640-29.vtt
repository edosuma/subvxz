WEBVTT

00:05.667 --> 00:08.233
- Juliet!
- Oh, hi! How's it going?

00:08.233 --> 00:10.834
I'm glad you're here.
I wanted to ask you something.

00:10.834 --> 00:13.133
Um...
Will you, uh...

00:13.133 --> 00:14.934
Will you go
to prom with me?

00:14.934 --> 00:17.700
Oh... [chuckles]
Justin, that... that's sweet.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.200
But I'm...
I'm a vampire,

00:19.200 --> 00:20.800
and I've been alive
for a long time,

00:20.800 --> 00:22.667
so I've been to
way too many proms.

00:23.467 --> 00:25.200
How many?

00:25.200 --> 00:27.200
Well...
Five hundred twenty-three.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.667
- Oh.
- Yeah.

00:30.667 --> 00:34.667
That's, um...
a sizable number.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.900
You see, the thing about prom
is people always expect too much

00:37.900 --> 00:39.100
and they're always let down.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.734
[scoffs]
Not this time.

00:40.734 --> 00:43.834
Guess what our theme is?
Best Night Ever.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.200
There you go.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.734
It's like one prom I went to,
the theme was Starry Night.

00:49.734 --> 00:52.133
- I was there
with this guy, Galileo.
- The astronomer?

00:52.133 --> 00:55.100
- Is there another one?
- I think there
might be a rapper.

00:55.100 --> 00:58.367
- Oh, no. That's Lil' Galileo.
- Oh, yeah.

00:58.367 --> 01:01.300
Juliet, if you go
to the prom with me,

01:01.300 --> 01:03.300
I will find a way
to make it special.

01:03.300 --> 01:06.600
I prom-ise.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.367
OK. I'll go.

01:09.367 --> 01:11.600
You won me over with
your goofy play on words.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.500
People underestimate
the power of goofy.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.200
Yes.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.367
Harper,
it's prom season!

01:20.367 --> 01:23.367
And this year's theme is
Best Night Ever. Awesome.

01:23.367 --> 01:25.233
Oh, my gosh.
I'm excited, too!

01:25.233 --> 01:27.500
Sometimes I stifle
my excitement in front of you,

01:27.500 --> 01:31.500
'cause you're rarely ever
excited like this! Wait.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.800
Why are you excited about prom?

01:33.800 --> 01:36.600
I'm not.
Look...

01:36.600 --> 01:40.000
I'm excited about you and me
planning the anti-prom.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.500
I knew it. I was excited
about the wrong thing.

01:43.500 --> 01:47.400
Harper, look, for anti-prom
we're gonna go with
a zombie theme.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.934
Zombies move really slow,
but they're also scary.

01:49.934 --> 01:53.133
Slow but scary is the perfect
combination in a monster...

01:53.133 --> 01:54.800
...and a prom.

01:55.667 --> 01:58.300
[no audible dialogue]

01:58.300 --> 02:00.800
Do you think Zeke
would go with me?

02:00.800 --> 02:03.500
[no audible dialogue]

02:03.500 --> 02:05.934
You like Zeke?

02:07.133 --> 02:09.233
Yeah.

02:09.233 --> 02:11.000
I think he likes me, too.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.800
I slipped and fell
in the cafeteria

02:12.800 --> 02:15.400
and he stepped around me
like a gentleman.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.400
Why don't you go ask him?

02:20.400 --> 02:22.133
Hey, Zeke...

02:22.133 --> 02:24.900
We're planning zombie prom on
the same night as regular prom.

02:24.900 --> 02:26.667
Oh! I love zombies.

02:26.667 --> 02:29.900
It's weird, though.
Their slowness actually
makes them scarier.

02:29.900 --> 02:34.300
I was wondering if maybe
you would like to...

02:35.834 --> 02:38.567
...be on the committee
to plan zombie prom?

02:38.567 --> 02:41.734
And maybe after we plan it,
we could...

02:41.734 --> 02:43.300
...be on the clean-up
committee.

02:43.300 --> 02:46.000
And in between
the planning and cleaning,

02:46.000 --> 02:47.734
we might as well...

02:47.734 --> 02:50.300
...stop by and make sure
everyone's having a good time.

02:53.233 --> 02:55.600
Are you asking me...

02:55.600 --> 02:58.100
...to be on three committees?

02:59.700 --> 03:04.100
Change my name to
Extracurricular Man! Oh!

03:10.600 --> 03:12.700
I totally chickened out.

03:12.700 --> 03:16.033
Yeah, but the good news is,
you're dressed like a chicken.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.600
These are penguins.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.400
Oh... that's funny.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.100
'Cause you said...

03:24.100 --> 03:25.367
You said chicken,

03:25.367 --> 03:28.800
but you're wearing
penguins and...

03:30.600 --> 03:32.500

04:35.900 --> 04:39.734
And that is why wands
are not supposed to be
kept in back pockets.

04:39.734 --> 04:40.934
Yes. Thank you, Dad.

04:40.934 --> 04:43.367
This baby's going
in my front pocket this time.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.600
[wand breaks]

04:51.233 --> 04:53.900
Oh! Wizard mail's here.

04:55.133 --> 04:58.000
There's a, uh,
package for Max.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.834
And it's not from himself.

04:59.834 --> 05:02.000
You finally learned where
to put the return address.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.300
[feigns a laugh]

05:08.767 --> 05:11.900
Hey, I've been chosen
to help trial test

05:11.900 --> 05:15.667
a new wizard gadget
called the No Fear Ring.

05:18.734 --> 05:21.367
Yeah, they, uh, want to see
if this thing makes me fearless,

05:21.367 --> 05:23.100
and then give them feedback.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.600
Dude, you don't even know
what the word feedback means.

05:27.934 --> 05:31.100
Feedback.
They want me to throw up.

05:32.867 --> 05:35.834
Yeah. I know how
to sound out words.

05:37.767 --> 05:41.233
Besides, I don't care.
They're gonna pay me for it.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.700
I'll just, uh,
sign this permission slip

05:45.700 --> 05:48.934
and have them send
the check to me.

05:48.934 --> 05:52.200
You know, to pay for
the new wand I'm about to buy.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.033
And that, too.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.734
Hey, Dad. Guys, I need to get
the word out about zombie prom.

06:02.734 --> 06:04.400
Zombie prom?

06:04.400 --> 06:07.867
Juliet and I will be
at Best Night Ever
with all the normal people.

06:07.867 --> 06:13.200
Yes. The wizard-slash-vampire
couple should definitely go
to the normal people prom.

06:15.734 --> 06:19.300
- Have fun with that.
- We will.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.300
What are you going
to call zombie prom,

06:21.300 --> 06:25.200
A Night to Dis-member?

06:29.834 --> 06:32.600
That's actually not bad idea.
Thank you, Justin.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.200
No, no, no. You can't use that.
That was a burn.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.300
It's in the burn rule book...

06:38.300 --> 06:40.667
...that's in that bookshelf.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.100
[scoffs]

06:43.100 --> 06:46.300
So, Max, will you hand
these out at school for me?

06:46.300 --> 06:48.100
I don't know about that, Alex.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.367
I mean I'm getting paid
for this No Fear Ring thing.

06:50.367 --> 06:53.500
So... you should probably
pay me for this.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.767
You mean, you'll have money
so you should pay me
for letting you do it?

06:56.767 --> 06:58.667
- Is that what I meant?
- That's what you said.

06:58.667 --> 07:03.200
OK, then. Oh, but can I pay you
after I hand them out?

07:03.200 --> 07:06.700
[scoffs] I should charge you
extra for that. But I won't.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.867
Thank you.
Just got to finish up, uh,

07:08.867 --> 07:12.000
filling out this
permission slip.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.500
[humming]

07:24.600 --> 07:27.200
That permission slip
seemed surprisingly heavy.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.400
Mail's here.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.133
Zombie prom?

07:46.734 --> 07:49.000
- I'm not going.
- [grunts]

07:49.000 --> 07:51.667
Last prom I lost an arm.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.767
I love to dance.

07:53.767 --> 07:57.200
Come on, we never do
anything fun anymore.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.300
Fine, I'll go.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.900
But I'm not dancing.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.367
All right, think, Zeke.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.934
I gotta make this prom
special for Juliet.

08:14.934 --> 08:18.400
- She's been to tons of them.
- Juliet's been to lots
of proms?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.200
Yeah.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.367
Because she already...
graduated.

08:24.367 --> 08:27.000
Ah, an older lady?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.767
Way to go, buddy.

08:28.767 --> 08:31.133
Hey, you know what
they say about older ladies?

08:31.133 --> 08:33.233
What?

08:33.233 --> 08:37.400
They like to eat dinner at 4:00
and they get amazing discounts.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.367
OK. OK, I got it.
Maybe...

08:40.367 --> 08:42.500
...I'll get up on stage
with the DJ, right?

08:42.500 --> 08:45.200
And I'll serenade Juliet
in front of everyone.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.600
Then, wait, wait, wait...

08:46.600 --> 08:49.567
When the tears are
welling up in her eyes,

08:49.567 --> 08:51.567
I'll ask her to go steady.

08:51.567 --> 08:53.300
Yeah, serenade?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.800
[robotic voice]
"Danger. Danger. Will Robinson."

08:55.800 --> 08:57.800
Here's what you do.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.133
Pick her up in
a horse-drawn carriage.

09:00.133 --> 09:03.500
Girls love alternative
means of transportation.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.200
- Huh?
- Dude!

09:06.200 --> 09:07.767
- Juliet, hey.
- Hi.

09:07.767 --> 09:09.867
Hey, OK. I know what
I'm gonna do.

09:09.867 --> 09:11.967
I'm gonna take you to prom...

09:11.967 --> 09:13.900
...in a horse-drawn carriage.

09:15.233 --> 09:17.900
Every time I've gone to prom
in a horse-drawn carriage,

09:17.900 --> 09:19.734
we've ended up
having to walk home.

09:19.734 --> 09:21.500
Why, 'cause the horses run away?

09:21.500 --> 09:23.300
Oh, they try.

09:23.300 --> 09:26.200
But I'm too fast for them.
Then it's lights out, horsy.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.867
But, you really don't need to
do anything special for prom.

09:30.867 --> 09:32.100
- It's OK.
- OK, fine.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.600
No horse-drawn carriage.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.834
But I'm still gonna
serenade you.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.800
Oh, that's pretty good.

09:37.800 --> 09:41.000
- No one's ever done that
before, Justin.
- I knew it.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.500
I know nothing about women.

09:48.233 --> 09:51.200
Oh, but hey, so I can't wait
to dig up my parents
and tell them.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.233
Zeke, there's only
one thing that will make
zombie prom fun for me.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.700
Would you...

10:02.700 --> 10:05.734
...design a decorative
coffin table for snacks?

10:05.734 --> 10:09.100
Snack committee? Yeah!

10:09.100 --> 10:12.000
Open the lid, get the dip.
I'm on it.

10:15.667 --> 10:19.300
Alex, I did it again.
I panicked and
completely bailed.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.667
Yeah, ya did.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.700
I think I can help you
with your fear. Hang on.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.500
Hey, Max.

10:27.867 --> 10:30.767
Good job bussing that table.
High five.

10:30.767 --> 10:32.867
It feels good
to be appreciated.

10:32.867 --> 10:34.967
Yeah, don't get used to it.

10:38.033 --> 10:39.934
Here, put this on.
I borrowed it from Max.

10:39.934 --> 10:41.600
It's a magic No Fear Ring.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.934
No Fear Ring?
I'm a little scared.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.000
Yeah.
Until you put it on.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.600
It goes with
what you're wearing.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.300
It does, doesn't it?

10:52.300 --> 10:53.967
But, don't show anybody.

10:53.967 --> 10:56.100
Max doesn't even know
I took it off his finger.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.233
You'd make an amazing
pick-pocket.

10:58.233 --> 11:01.367
Hey. It's not a skill
I'm proud of.

11:01.367 --> 11:04.500
Yes, it is.
It totally comes in handy.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.900
Ah! Which reminds me...
Here is your coin purse back.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.400
Sorry.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.000
Zeke. Zombie prom.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.934
Me, you, on a date.
Let's do this thing!

11:20.834 --> 11:23.734
- Totally!
- Walk with me.

11:23.734 --> 11:25.800
And keep telling me things
you love about me.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.500
Well, ladybugs
are awesome on you.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.400
And you walk fast,
that's cool.

12:05.033 --> 12:07.200
No, I know you can sing.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.667
I'm just saying,

12:08.667 --> 12:11.500
do you really want to do it
in front of all those people,

12:11.500 --> 12:13.700
staring right up at you?

12:13.700 --> 12:18.000
Waving their cell phone cameras.
Taking your picture.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.667
Putting it on the Internet

12:19.667 --> 12:23.200
for people to see
over and over and over again?

12:23.200 --> 12:28.467
so people can watch it
for years and years and years.

12:30.567 --> 12:32.700
No, it's gonna,
it's gonna be great,

12:32.700 --> 12:34.200
because after that,

12:34.200 --> 12:36.300
I'm going to ask her
to go steady with me.

12:36.300 --> 12:39.767
Go steady? Whose prom
are you going to? Grandpa's?

12:39.767 --> 12:42.133
Going steady is romantic.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.967
If you find hysterical laughter
romantic, then you're good.

12:44.967 --> 12:48.033
- I'm not nervous, Alex.
- Oh, I didn't ask,
but thank you.

12:53.367 --> 12:55.967
Max, where's the ring, dude?
I need to borrow it tonight.

12:55.967 --> 12:58.000
Fine, but this thing
doesn't even work.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.900
I don't feel
the least bit different.

13:02.467 --> 13:04.734
What?! Where's the ring?

13:04.734 --> 13:08.967
Oh. Maybe that's why
I don't feel different.

13:08.967 --> 13:11.900
- Hmm...
- Max, where's the ring?

13:11.900 --> 13:14.934
I won't have the nerve
to serenade Juliet tonight
without that ring.

13:14.934 --> 13:17.100
And how in the world am I
going to ask her to go steady?

13:17.100 --> 13:21.400
Go steady?
Who are you, Grandpa?

13:21.400 --> 13:24.100
I promised her
I'd sing to her,

13:24.100 --> 13:26.834
and without that ring
I'm scared to death.

13:26.834 --> 13:30.367
Hmm. Check my ear. I have
my finger in there a lot.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.567
We're done talking.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.834
- [soft music plays]
- How great is this?

13:43.834 --> 13:47.700
We all look gross,
no one's smiling,
and we get to drink brains.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.734
Do I have any brains
in my teeth?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.400
- Yes.
- Cool, cool.

14:00.133 --> 14:03.033
Hey, no cutsies.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.300
[gags] The costume is weak,
but the smell is right on.

14:08.300 --> 14:12.567
Wow. Nice skin,
veiny-looking things, man.

14:12.567 --> 14:13.967
Way... way to commit, man.

14:16.500 --> 14:20.200
Why don't you shuffle yourself
to the back of the line.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.867
Uh, Harper, maybe we should
just let him cut in front.

14:22.867 --> 14:26.200
He seems a little dehydrated,
not in the mood to talk.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.934
Zeke, how can you be so cute and
so spineless at the same time?

14:29.934 --> 14:31.400
I'm going to stand up
to this punk.

14:39.767 --> 14:41.734
[sighs]

14:43.800 --> 14:46.000
- Real zombie?
- [grunts]

14:46.000 --> 14:47.567
OK.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.767
[clears throat] Let's hear it
for the Best Night Ever.

14:55.467 --> 14:57.734
[clears throat] Anyway, um...

14:57.734 --> 15:02.967
I would, uh, I would like
to call up to the stage
Juliet Van Heusen.

15:02.967 --> 15:07.233
[applause and cheers]

15:07.233 --> 15:10.200
And before I announce
the winner

15:10.200 --> 15:14.600
of the table centerpiece
raffle... over there,

15:14.600 --> 15:17.567
I would like
to sing to her.

15:17.567 --> 15:19.767
Oh, my gosh,
he's gonna sing to her.

15:19.767 --> 15:22.100
Don't you ever
do that to me.

15:23.900 --> 15:27.000
- [blows notes]
- [hums a note]

15:27.000 --> 15:28.900
Good.

15:28.900 --> 15:32.100
[clears throat] One moment,
just gotta get the beat.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.300
How's that for perfect timing?

15:39.300 --> 15:44.133
Hey. This right here,
is the highlight
of your whole life.

15:45.967 --> 15:48.934
How do you feel about it now?
That's right.

- Hold for it.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.734
I'd like to say one more thing,
people, before you clap.

16:26.734 --> 16:28.400
Juliet...

16:29.900 --> 16:31.400
...would you like
to go steady with me?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.233
[crowd murmuring]

16:35.934 --> 16:38.200
[whispering] Justin, the real
zombies have crashed zombie...

16:38.200 --> 16:41.800
- I can't hear you.
- [in microphone] Real zombies
have crashed the zombie prom.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.100
Uh...

16:45.100 --> 16:48.400
Um... a lot of...
a lot of...

16:48.400 --> 16:54.133
A lot of you might think
you heard me say zombies.

16:54.133 --> 16:57.834
But that's because
it's a zombie prom,

16:57.834 --> 17:02.667
so I say zombies a lot.

17:02.667 --> 17:06.767
Just like I did right now.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.967
That is all.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.767
- [accoustic feedback]
- [clears throat]

17:15.767 --> 17:19.400
What she meant was
is the band, the Real Zombies,

17:19.400 --> 17:22.200
uh, is actually playing
at the zombie prom.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.834
[crowd cheering]

17:27.300 --> 17:29.100
- [uptempo music plays]
- What are you looking at?

17:29.100 --> 17:30.967
I want to have you
for dinner.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.700
I have a date, jerk.
Zeke?

17:32.700 --> 17:36.500
- Zeke?
- Psst! Under here.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.900
And now you've made
my date uncomfortable.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.300
You're gonna apologize or else
you're gonna meet the king

17:41.300 --> 17:43.133
and queen of this prom.

17:45.133 --> 17:47.000
Where's Zeke?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.834
- [speaking in alien language]
- [responds in alien language]

17:49.834 --> 17:52.367
- Zeke!
- Justin!

17:52.367 --> 17:54.033
You are a sight for sore eyes.

17:54.033 --> 17:55.500
Harper's standing up
to those creeps.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.734
- She's fearless.
- Got any room under there?

17:58.967 --> 18:00.367
For Juliet.

18:00.367 --> 18:04.500
Or... or, we could stay out here
and I could help you fight.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.400
OK. Yeah.
Let's do that.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.100
Max, save yourself.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.700
This place is infested
with zombies.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.734
Yeah, I know.
I got an RSVP from some zombies.

18:16.734 --> 18:19.600
That's where the flyers went.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.567
Yes. Zombies are coming, man.

18:22.567 --> 18:25.400
But don't worry,
I already locked the doors.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.700
Nobody can get in
and we can't get out.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.900
Did you at least find
the No Fear Ring?

18:32.900 --> 18:34.800
- I could use it right now.
- Harper has it.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.767
That's why she's standing up
to the zombies.

18:36.767 --> 18:40.200
Whoa. Harper has my ring?
I'm going in.

18:44.133 --> 18:46.700
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through.

18:46.700 --> 18:50.100
Harper, you gotta
give me my ring back.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.800
I'm a product tester and
I need to file a report on it

18:52.800 --> 18:54.400
in order to get paid.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.600
All right, not now.
You know, you don't scare me.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.066
Guys, we've got
to help Harper.

19:01.734 --> 19:03.900
We've come to help you
get out of here.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.000
What? I'm not afraid
of these losers.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.033
Uh, if I didn't
know any better,

19:08.033 --> 19:10.800
I'd say these zombie prom-goers
were actual zombies.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.400
Uh, they're from another
school's drama department.

19:13.400 --> 19:17.567
They have an unbelievable
costume designer
who also teaches chorus.

19:17.567 --> 19:20.934
Costume designer
and chorus teacher?

19:20.934 --> 19:23.667
Mr. Santos from Jefferson High.

19:23.667 --> 19:26.867
Oh, they must be here
to dance battle us.

19:26.867 --> 19:28.734
Dance battle?

19:30.100 --> 19:32.033
We do love to dance.

19:33.734 --> 19:34.767
It's on!

19:36.133 --> 19:38.300
One music video
and we're expected

19:38.300 --> 19:39.800
to have dance battles
everywhere.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.700
- Come on!

Yes!

21:25.867 --> 21:29.000
Yeah! Yeah!
We won, we won!

21:29.000 --> 21:32.300
Just once I'd like
to win one of these!

21:33.567 --> 21:36.600
That's right,
keep walking, zombies.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.367
What kind of zombies
can't even dance a zombie dance?

21:39.367 --> 21:41.367
Max, shh! Be quiet.
They're zombies.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.934
They could come back
and eat your brain.

21:42.934 --> 21:44.700
Yeah?

21:44.700 --> 21:47.400
Good luck trying to eat
these brains, zombies.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.400
My dad says I got
a thick skull.

21:51.400 --> 21:52.967
He's not wearing
the No Fear Ring,

21:52.967 --> 21:55.400
but he's still not
afraid of anything.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.734
Maybe the ring doesn't work.

21:56.734 --> 21:59.000
But when Harper had it on,
she had no fear.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.600
Oh, my gosh.
It doesn't work on him,

22:02.600 --> 22:04.400
because he already
has no fear.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.400
Everybody has fear.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.500
Guys, who wants to dare me to
cannonball into that punch bowl?

22:09.500 --> 22:12.600
Ahh, you don't have
to dare me.
I dare myself.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.100
OK. He has no fear.

22:15.100 --> 22:19.367
Alex, anti-prom was
more popular than real prom.

22:19.367 --> 22:23.734
Wait. That means next year
more people will want
to go to anti-prom.

22:23.734 --> 22:26.734
So... then we'll go
to real prom.

22:26.734 --> 22:29.300
We're always one step
ahead of them.

22:31.967 --> 22:34.567
[slow music plays]

22:38.667 --> 22:41.200
You really know
how to zombie dance.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.767
How many, uh, how many
zombie proms have you been to?

22:46.500 --> 22:48.834
Yes.

22:50.600 --> 22:54.600
- Yes?
- Yes, I'll go steady with you.

22:54.600 --> 22:58.300
You will. That's...

22:58.300 --> 22:59.900
That's great,

22:59.900 --> 23:03.200
because people sort of
indicated that it was lame,

23:03.200 --> 23:06.600
but, like, I don't really
care what people think and...

23:06.600 --> 23:08.767
[sighs] I'm nuts about you

23:08.767 --> 23:11.467
and I just want
to make you happy.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.700
This is the
best night ever.
