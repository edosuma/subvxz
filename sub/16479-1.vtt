I'm booking a ticket.
A ticket?

00:31.332 --> 00:33.966
Yeah, Reagan is going
to New Orleans for work

00:33.968 --> 00:36.502
for three months and she asked
me to go with her.

How long does it take
to respond to a house offer?

We will find out about the house

In fact, I think she may have
found a house

Woodworking is awesome.

Nicholas Miller?

this was a crime scene.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.440
Yeah, but that
was months ago.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.809
And it was drug thing,
so there are no ghosts.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.644
That's not how ghosts work.
This is in your price range,

05:12.646 --> 05:14.746
and it's, like, only five
minutes from the loft.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.348
I really think this is
the best investment

06:06.066 --> 06:08.900
Perfect, gentle,
unrelenting pressure.

06:11.638 --> 06:12.904

06:14.742 --> 06:16.641
Really sad neighborhood.

06:16.643 --> 06:17.843
Also it's crazy expensive.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.244
I'm the voice of reason,

06:19.246 --> 06:20.312
that's why you brought me with.

06:20.314 --> 06:22.147
We-we didn't
bring you with.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.815
You followed us
here in your car.
Okay.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.817
She followed us the whole way.
I know, I know.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.153
Cece, I'm begging you,
please tell her to go home.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.155
Yeah, I know.
We need to start
setting some boundaries.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.923
You know what, though?
She's not wrong.

06:31.925 --> 06:35.894
This place is way over
our borrowing limit.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.829
Damn it.

close was that...

06:40.434 --> 06:41.266
BOTH:
Carpet house.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.438
All right.
We will ask for a bigger loan.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.374
And It'll be tight,
but we'll manage it.
Okay.

06:49.376 --> 06:50.509
Yeah, we can do it.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.077
Look, we'll just
make sacrifices.
Yeah.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.279
We'll pack our lunches.
We'll cut out cup-on's.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.381
It's coupons.
Cup-ons, yeah.

06:56.383 --> 06:57.916
No, you're saying cup-ons.
Well, it's fine.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.635
It's not important,
we'll cut out cup-ons.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.353
Coupons.
But if we're gonna
do this, we're gonna have
to go to the bank now

07:01.355 --> 07:03.889
because this house is gonna
go like this, I know it.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.124
Why is she talking
to the realtor?

07:06.126 --> 07:07.192
I will handle it, okay?

07:07.194 --> 07:08.760
It's-it's tot... it's... Oh.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.228

minute? Jessica?

07:13.567 --> 07:16.401
Hey, honey, this can't happen.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.769

you can't stop
thinking about Nick.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.106
is rookie work.

07:55.108 --> 07:55.974
Okay.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.576
She going home?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.144
Yeah, let's go to the bank.
Let's do it.
You know what, actually,

07:59.146 --> 08:00.612
I just want to use
the cooktop first.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.481
Make an egg.
Honey, where are you
gonna get an egg?

08:02.483 --> 08:04.616
Got two eggs right here.
Got a pan right here.

08:04.618 --> 08:08.019
Think I'm gonna buy a house
and not make an egg first?

08:08.021 --> 08:09.254
And I'm a Sagittarius,

08:09.256 --> 08:11.790
which is why I'm so good
with people and horses.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.124
But it also makes me, like,

08:13.126 --> 08:14.926
really sleepy.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.761
Uh, Leslie...
(nervous laugh)

08:16.763 --> 08:18.630
Um, there's no...

08:18.632 --> 08:21.800
there's no easy way to say this.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.134
Uh...

08:23.136 --> 08:24.970
you...

08:24.972 --> 08:29.441
no longer work...
for Schmidt and Cece.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.142
No, no, they're firing me?

08:31.144 --> 08:32.677
No, but didn't you tell them
how good I am?

08:32.679 --> 08:33.945
Well, you know, I tried to.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.314
I was like, I was like,
"Man, she good..."

08:36.316 --> 08:37.516
You didn't stick up for me,
Winston?

08:37.518 --> 08:39.050
Well, I tried...
I'm calling Aly!

08:39.052 --> 08:40.819
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, no, no, time out, time out.

08:40.821 --> 08:41.820
Listen, hey, hey, hey.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.154
Time out. Stop.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.323
Stop that. You
didn't let me finish.

08:45.325 --> 08:48.059
You don't work
for Schmidt and Cece

08:48.061 --> 08:51.530
anymore, because...

08:52.299 --> 08:55.066
'Cause you work for me now.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.970
I'm buying a house.
(shrieks happily)

08:58.972 --> 09:00.805
I'm buying a house!
(laughing)

09:00.807 --> 09:03.241
Ha, ha! I'm buying a home.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.876
(horns honking)

09:04.878 --> 09:07.312
We do not look
great on paper.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.981
Please, on paper, we're as ugly
as Winston's bellybutton ring.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.150
Who gets a bellybutton ring
if you have an outie?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.818
And at 33, no less.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.321
But trust me, loan officers
have a lot of discretion.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.989
We just need
to market ourselves.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.491
We need to look him
right in the eye...

09:19.493 --> 09:22.060
Mr. Schmidt
and Mrs. Parikh?

09:23.697 --> 09:25.030
I'm not blind.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.432
I just had my pupils dilated
for an exam.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.900
If it makes you feel any better,

09:28.902 --> 09:30.435
I'm seeing stars, too.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.404
What?

09:32.406 --> 09:33.605
I'm talking about you.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.374
Okay, honey, just... shh.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.742
Shh.
You're a big, bright star.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.111
It ain't gonna be
that kind of party today, pal.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.514
Follow me.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.884
(exhales)

09:45.886 --> 09:47.052
NICK (muffled):
Hey, Crawdaddy's home!

09:47.054 --> 09:48.954
(coughs)

09:48.956 --> 09:50.855
I had a whole

09:50.857 --> 09:52.390
crawdaddy thing, but I...
the point is, I'm home.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.391
(clears throat)

09:53.393 --> 09:54.793
Hey, Nick.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.362
You weren't supposed to be home
for, like, a month.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.597
Are you guys
doing okay?

09:58.599 --> 10:00.065
Yeah, uh, Reagan's drug company

10:00.067 --> 10:01.466
is moving her up to Seattle...

10:01.468 --> 10:03.702
Okay.
...so we're doing
the distance thing.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.470
Yeah, we're doing great.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.372
You know what they call
Seattle in Portland?

10:07.374 --> 10:08.873
North Portland.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.375
Or, uh, Vancouver's Shoe.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.910
What?

10:11.912 --> 10:13.111
Vancouver's Shoe.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.047
(chuckles)

10:16.049 --> 10:17.882
Get in here!

10:17.884 --> 10:18.883
Give me a hug!

10:18.885 --> 10:20.919
Okay.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.220
All right!

10:22.222 --> 10:23.455
Wow, look at you.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.589
You got jacked.
Yeah.

10:24.591 --> 10:25.590
What, did you go to prison?

10:25.592 --> 10:26.658
(chuckles)
(laughs)
No.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.893
I worked out a lot.
Come on, sit down.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.395
I haven't seen you in months.
I need some Jess.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.463
I also have
something

10:31.465 --> 10:33.031
very important to tell you.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.635
Is everything okay?
Um...

10:36.637 --> 10:38.603
I have to, um...

10:38.605 --> 10:40.238
It's just, I have
to meet my friend.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.840
I mean, I have
to go to the zoo.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.241
The zoo? You hate zoos.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.309
Um, I was supposed to meet her
in the lemur section

10:44.311 --> 10:45.310
of the parking lot

10:45.312 --> 10:46.478
like ten minutes ago,
so...

10:46.480 --> 10:47.612
What friend?

10:47.614 --> 10:48.980
Why...? Deedee.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.782
I have to meet Deedee.
She's, like, a good friend.

10:50.784 --> 10:51.916
"Deedee"?

10:51.918 --> 10:52.917
That's not a name.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.919
You have one friend.
It's Cece.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.689
This sounds fishy.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.292
Yeah, no.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.194
We can't loan you
any more money.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.562
JESS (whispering):
Cece!

11:07.134 --> 11:09.167
Oh. Okay.
What?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.802
No, I...
I-I know what this is about.

11:10.804 --> 11:11.970
I'll just be a moment.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.638
You know what what's...
Thank you.

11:13.640 --> 11:14.572
Ce... ce...

11:15.642 --> 11:17.275
What's happening?

11:17.277 --> 11:18.910
What is happening?

11:23.383 --> 11:24.983
Jessica...
You said "emergency."

11:24.985 --> 11:26.718
Well, this is an emergency.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.719
Nick is home.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.454
What is your
emergency?

11:29.456 --> 11:30.555
Don't glory in it, Cece.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.323
Please don't mistake

11:32.325 --> 11:34.459
my measured bank tone
for calmness,

11:34.461 --> 11:37.295
as I am filled with
the waters of rage.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.364
Jess, I know that
you've come here

11:39.366 --> 11:41.032
to convince Cece that
she shouldn't buy this house.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.234
No.
Babe, this is an emergency.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.437
I have feelings
for Nick again, okay?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.473
There. I said it.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.041
(sighs)

11:52.979 --> 11:55.180
I saw him for one second

11:55.182 --> 11:56.815
and I freaked out.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.149
I told him
I was going to the zoo.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.250
BOTH:
You hate the zoo.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.252
There's something about him.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.255
I see him
and my heart explodes.

12:06.893 --> 12:10.428
We all need to meet new people.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.696
Oh...

12:11.698 --> 12:13.031
(seagulls squawking)
Where are we?

12:13.033 --> 12:14.599
Your new hood!

12:14.601 --> 12:18.336
Okay, so, I couldn't
check all the boxes,

12:18.338 --> 12:20.872
but I think nailed
the most important one:

12:20.874 --> 12:23.308
that it can float.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.114
That's a... that's a boat.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.548
Yeah.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.617
I was just driving to my
doctor's office last night

12:32.619 --> 12:34.285
and I saw it.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.954
And you thought, "Okay."

12:35.956 --> 12:37.255
Where-where's your
doctor's office?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.189
Three boats down.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.026
Should we call Aly
and tell her the good news?

12:43.463 --> 12:45.630
I had no idea
you were going through this.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.966
I can't even be
in the same room as Nick.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.634
I don't know
what I'm saying

12:49.636 --> 12:51.803
and what if I say something
that ruins our friendship?
Get out.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.638
What?
Get out. Get out right now.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.273
Get out instantly.
What? What happened to
the "I'm so sorry"?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.709
Nick is on his way to the bank
right now. I texted him.

12:57.711 --> 12:59.210
I need his help with the loan.
What?
What?

12:59.212 --> 13:01.412
We need to put the bar
up for collateral, okay?

13:01.414 --> 13:03.448
We're miles past our borrowing
limit. It's the only way.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.449
Yeah, but the bar?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.050
No time. There he is.
What?

13:06.052 --> 13:07.619
SCHMIDT:
Hey, Nick!

13:07.621 --> 13:09.287
Ah!

13:09.289 --> 13:10.789
(laughing)

13:10.791 --> 13:12.957
Just pretend like we're having
a normal conversation.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.059
Oh, God. Oh, God.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.661
Okay. Um...

13:16.663 --> 13:19.798
This is, um, this is Margaret.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.132
This is Gracie.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.901
Oh. No. You think I...

13:22.903 --> 13:23.835
Oh, no.

13:23.837 --> 13:24.836
I'm not a bank robber.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.271
Stop reaching
for that button.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.806
I'm just trying to avoid my ex.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.974
Oh, thank God.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.176
God, I missed you.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.811
You know,
I slept in your bed twice.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.679
Look at your hair,
you hippie.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.481
Yeah, just come
over here! Great!

13:36.483 --> 13:38.449
Um, oh. Uh, heads up.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.485
There are over 60 pairs
of shoes in your room.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.420
Uh, heads up,
they're all in the hallway now.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.421
Oh, okay.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.956
Sir, sorry to keep you waiting.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.357
This is my co-signer.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.493
(sighs)
NICK:
Point me in any direction
and I'll sign.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.694
(chuckles)

13:49.696 --> 13:51.596
So this is the place, eh?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.965
Beautiful picture of it.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.834
That's how much it is?
That's really exp...

13:57.637 --> 13:59.704
Schmidty, are you sure you know
what you're getting us into?

14:00.941 --> 14:01.940
Yeah, man.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.208
All right.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.776
(Cece giggles)
Congrats.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.280
Did we get the loan?

14:09.282 --> 14:10.982
I wish it were up to me,

14:10.984 --> 14:13.318
because the answer
would be "no"

14:13.320 --> 14:15.153
and all of this would be over.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.154
He's been a buzzkill all day.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.155
Yeah.
That's all right.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.523
I owe you one American dream...

14:18.525 --> 14:19.524
(laughs)

14:19.526 --> 14:21.292
...you sweet angel.
We did it!

14:21.294 --> 14:23.127
I'm so happy
for you guys.

14:23.129 --> 14:24.462
Hey, I gotta go.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.864
(photo clatters to floor)
I got it.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.766
Beautiful family.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.104
(exhales)
It's okay,
it's okay.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.476
(exhales)
This is stupid.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.311
I can't keep hiding from him.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.713
Jess, just give me
a sec, okay?
No, Cece...
Cece, it's fine.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.314
I'll come back
with you.
Go... go with Jess now.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.550
No, no, no, no.
I have to do this myself.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.519
And you guys
have to buy a house.

14:48.521 --> 14:51.322
This is good;
this is you moving forward.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.657
Thanks, Jess.
Get in here.

14:53.827 --> 14:55.159
Oh, I love you guys.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.327
Okay.
(grunts)

14:56.329 --> 14:57.362
Oh...
Oh, my God.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.497
(laughs)

14:59.499 --> 15:00.832
Lost my breath, there.

15:00.834 --> 15:01.833
She's a strong... strong one.

15:01.835 --> 15:04.202
Well, you're getting the loan.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.069
What?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.604
Interest rates are about to drop

15:06.606 --> 15:08.039
and we want to settle you

15:08.041 --> 15:09.707
with a high one
before they do, so...

15:09.709 --> 15:10.875
We got the loan?
We can make an offer?

15:10.877 --> 15:11.943
(laughing):
It doesn't make

15:11.945 --> 15:13.244
a lick of sense to me,

15:13.246 --> 15:15.079
but there you go.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.247
So many zeros.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.515
That's a lot of zeros.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.592
What are you doing?

15:32.732 --> 15:33.731
WINSTON:
Hella?

15:33.733 --> 15:34.732
Are you buying a boat?

15:34.734 --> 15:35.967
(sighs)

15:35.969 --> 15:38.102
Look, it is
a complicated situation.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.103
First off,

15:39.105 --> 15:41.239
I think your sister is amazing.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.373
Secondly,

15:42.375 --> 15:44.275
I know that we just
went long-distance

15:44.277 --> 15:45.777
and I don't want
to give you any bad news,

15:45.779 --> 15:47.111
but...

15:47.113 --> 15:50.081
your sister
ain't that good at her job.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.416
Like, at all.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.952
She's... uh, dumb.

15:53.954 --> 15:54.986
That girl

15:54.988 --> 15:56.788
is the trunk of a tree.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.489
Ain't nobody at home up here.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.158
Okay, you...
She a cottonhead!

16:00.160 --> 16:02.393
Easy...
This girl is
a dumped-out sewing kit.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.062
Easy.
She talkin',
but ain't nobody listenin'.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.264
Easy. That's my sister.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.433
And I know she's an idiot.

16:08.435 --> 16:09.600
(exhales)
Thank God.

16:09.602 --> 16:10.902
Just because we're long-distance

16:10.904 --> 16:12.437
doesn't mean we can't be real
with each other.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.771
Okay?

16:13.773 --> 16:14.973
We have to tell each other
everything.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.307
(sighs)

16:16.309 --> 16:17.909
I don't know what
the word "panache" means.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.744
It means having
a certain kind of flair.

16:19.746 --> 16:20.979
That...

16:20.981 --> 16:22.447
All right, I'm gonna
hang up now. Are you ready?

16:22.449 --> 16:24.082
Of course I'm ready.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.029
Okay. Love you.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.303
You okay, Jess?

16:45.305 --> 16:47.372
Yeah, it's just...

16:47.374 --> 16:49.040
something I have to handle
on my own.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.041
No such thing.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.175
I'm standing right here.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.243
Lay it on me.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.312
Okay.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.980
But it's pretty major.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.315
Do you think you can handle it?

16:57.317 --> 16:59.283
Yes. N... No.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.686
I jumped the gun.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.054
I should've said I don't...
I don't know.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.123
Here goes. Um...

17:06.326 --> 17:07.525
So Nick's back.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.693
Ooh, don't I know it!

17:08.695 --> 17:10.795
Don't I know it!

17:10.797 --> 17:11.963
Nick is back!

17:11.965 --> 17:13.164
You know,
maybe I can't handle it.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.832
I haven't even gotten
to the major part yet.

17:14.834 --> 17:15.967
Oh.

17:15.969 --> 17:18.369
What I'm trying to say is...

17:20.640 --> 17:22.473
I'm not over Nick.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.812
Oh...

17:27.814 --> 17:29.313
Ooh...

17:29.315 --> 17:30.314
Mm.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.316
Oh...!

17:32.318 --> 17:33.851
Oh...
I know.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.020
Hm... mm...?

17:36.022 --> 17:37.555
Oh...

17:37.557 --> 17:39.590
And you guys are all moving on.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.427
And I'm still here,

17:42.429 --> 17:45.663
where I was,
waiting outside Nick's door,

17:45.665 --> 17:47.765
trying to figure out

17:47.767 --> 17:51.669
how to... talk to him
without having a heart attack.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.204
Okay. Okay, listen.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.439
You can't control

17:54.441 --> 17:55.973
who you panache.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.776
Just a quick check-in:
how am I handling this?

17:58.778 --> 18:00.945
Bizarrely...

18:00.947 --> 18:02.113
but it's kind of working.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.548
Okay.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.184
I have to figure out
how to be friends with him again

18:06.186 --> 18:07.618
but I can't even bring...

18:07.620 --> 18:10.621
bring myself
to knock on his door.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.158
Well, that's okay, Jess,
because I'm here.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.994
(knocking)
NICK:
Yeah?

18:18.231 --> 18:19.397
WINSTON:
Uh, Nick, question:

18:19.399 --> 18:22.233
um, do you have
another gator tooth?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.568
I seem to have swallowed mine.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.902
I've given you
a lot of gator teeth.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.204
This is
the last one.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.905
And stop putting stuff
in your mouth.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.941
I will make no such promise.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.109
Hey, Day.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.878
Hey, Miller.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.883
Well, Bish out.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.318
For the third time in my life,

18:40.320 --> 18:42.220
I have to call off
a boat purchase.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.721
What?

18:46.426 --> 18:47.492
(chuckles)

18:47.494 --> 18:48.993
So I just want to...
How was the zoo?

18:48.995 --> 18:51.062
Oh. Sorry.
You go, you go first.

18:51.064 --> 18:52.930
Oh, I just...

18:52.932 --> 18:54.398
How was New Orleans?

18:54.400 --> 18:55.666
How-how was everything?

18:55.668 --> 18:56.667
It was great.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.803
(laughs)
I came alive in that city, Jess.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.106
I was writing 2,000 pages
a day by hand.

19:02.108 --> 19:03.608
What?
By hand. Yes.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.611
Unfortunately, it all blew
into the Mississippi River.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.979
Oh, my God, no.
That's terrible.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.814
I mean, for you
and for the environment...

19:09.816 --> 19:12.150
And I had to start over,
so I invested in a computer--

19:12.152 --> 19:13.818
I bought the heaviest one
I could find--

19:13.820 --> 19:15.153
and look...

19:15.155 --> 19:16.287
heavy computers, heavy materiel.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.455
This is my first book.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.789
What?
Yeah.

19:18.791 --> 19:19.824
This is what
I wanted to tell you.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.626
Oh, my God.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.327
(laughing):
It's my book!

19:23.329 --> 19:25.630
Nick, how many days did it
take to print this out?

19:25.632 --> 19:27.265
About a week.
I had to go

19:27.267 --> 19:28.466
to a car rental place
at night, but, uh...

19:28.468 --> 19:29.700
read the first page.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.870
"To Anthony Rizzo
and the Chicago Cubs,

19:32.872 --> 19:34.272
"for all we've been through.

19:36.643 --> 19:39.644
"And to my friend Jessica Day...

19:39.646 --> 19:41.712
for the same thing."

19:43.283 --> 19:45.816
I don't know if you
remember this, but, uh...

19:45.818 --> 19:47.885
you were the one who told me

19:47.887 --> 19:49.453
to go to New Orleans.

19:49.455 --> 19:50.621
So thank you.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.723
You're welcome.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.959
We got the house.

19:54.961 --> 19:55.993
For real this time.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.628
That's great!

19:57.630 --> 19:58.763
Come on, let's go see it!
NICK:
Let's go!

20:00.133 --> 20:01.465
Let me just get...
You got to...

20:01.467 --> 20:03.134
Get... yeah,
got to fold it perfect.
Oh. Yeah, okay. Sorry.

20:03.136 --> 20:04.802
Just because, you know...

20:04.804 --> 20:06.137
(exhales)

20:06.139 --> 20:07.972
(doves cooing, wings flapping)

20:07.974 --> 20:10.808
Guys, I know I found this place,
but... yikes.

20:10.810 --> 20:11.809
Is that a bloody kite?

20:11.811 --> 20:13.477
I smell coyote babies.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.079
The other house
was just too expensive.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.747
CECE:
Yeah, this place
is actually perfect.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.417
Or at least it will be,
once we redo it.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.985
This whole room
could be mid-century.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.020
You could use the crown molding
as a focal point.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.021
(squeaking, scuttling)

20:24.023 --> 20:26.157
I'm sorry.

20:26.159 --> 20:27.325
I'm inserting.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.326
It's okay.
No.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.427
Look, we clearly are gonna need

20:29.429 --> 20:30.528
everyone's help on this.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.596
Oh, thank you, God!

20:31.598 --> 20:33.097
Okay. We have to extend
the dining room,

20:33.099 --> 20:35.166
track light
the hallway,

20:35.168 --> 20:36.767
that closet is begging
to be a half bath...

20:36.769 --> 20:39.237
See, what we have here
is called good bones.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.538
You understand?

20:40.540 --> 20:41.872
Hit the wall, make sure...

20:41.874 --> 20:42.940
Oh, no!
(clattering)

20:42.942 --> 20:43.908
Hmm.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.276
Yeah, that... uh, that bone,

20:45.278 --> 20:46.844
that bone was broken
when I saw it.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.112
Whatever. Don't worry about it.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.114
We're gonna tear this place
down to the studs.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.917
Yeah, you know?
We'll just start right here.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.086
(whooping)

20:55.088 --> 20:56.287
CECE:
Right?

20:56.289 --> 20:58.623
It's okay,
'cause we're the owners!

20:58.625 --> 20:59.790
(upbeat pop song begins)
You're the owners!

20:59.792 --> 21:00.791
We're the owners.
Yeah!

21:00.793 --> 21:01.892
They're the owners!

21:01.894 --> 21:03.127

22:05.658 --> 22:07.725
(crowd cheering)

22:09.929 --> 22:13.531
ANNOUNCER:
And there you have it--
for the first time in history,

22:13.533 --> 22:16.701
a woman has taken the mound
in a major league baseball game.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.270
Hi to my daughters, who are
actually watching their dad

22:19.272 --> 22:21.672
with great interest
for this game.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.708
Being a person
that does something
for the first time,

22:23.710 --> 22:25.643
to me,
was really intriguing,

22:25.645 --> 22:28.612
and I really wanted
to take that journey.

22:28.614 --> 22:31.949
-Are you ready for this?
-I've been ready my whole life.

22:31.951 --> 22:35.119
BUNBURY: This is her dream,
but she's worked
incredibly hard for it.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.791
-Again.
-BUNBURY: Jenny's father
sees her gift,

22:40.793 --> 22:42.526
and he wants to
capitalize on that.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.962
You're never gonna have the arm
to get you to the majors.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.430
That's why we need
a secret weapon.

22:50.837 --> 22:54.338
(crowd cheering)

22:54.340 --> 22:58.142
Now let's see this screwgie
everybody's been talkin' about.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.480
Mike is the captain
of the team.

23:02.482 --> 23:05.015
Twelve years
as a veteran catcher.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.318
She comes on the team,
and she's a rookie,

23:07.320 --> 23:11.088
and he treats her like a rookie,
not treating her a certain way
just because of her gender.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.490
Take a breath.
Give me the ball.

23:12.492 --> 23:15.760
-Take a minute.
-Give me the ball.

23:15.762 --> 23:19.730
I have two daughters.
I don't want them to be limited

23:19.732 --> 23:21.766
to things in life
just based on their gender.

23:21.768 --> 23:24.835
Just because
it hasn't been done before
doesn't mean it can't be done.

23:24.837 --> 23:28.339
Think I'm gonna do
the baseball fans proud.
