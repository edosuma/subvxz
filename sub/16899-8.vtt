WEBVTT

00:04.740 --> 00:07.994
Our boys have landed in France.
A small coastal village Dieppe.

00:08.050 --> 00:11.349
They told us Operation Jubilee
was a success.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.697
Some of these men....

00:12.750 --> 00:14.047
Things did not go well.

00:14.100 --> 00:17.058
You're hardly the cause
of your fianc's demise.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.317
You cannot blame yourself.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.227
But I do daddy. I do.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.407
I thought I would
never see you again.

00:23.450 --> 00:25.668
If you want I'll
ship out right now.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.678
No.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.233
My date wants to say "hello".

00:30.290 --> 00:31.325
Your "date"?

00:31.370 --> 00:34.066
Doctor Narendra Patel
meet my mother.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.850
I'm going to visit my
brother in Perth County.

00:36.900 --> 00:39.209
You don't need to
do this for me.

00:39.250 --> 00:40.854
I'm doing this for myself.

00:40.910 --> 00:44.687
Though I think some time apart
may be good for both of us.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.109
C'mon Princess forget
your troubles.

01:17.590 --> 01:19.501
Bets, I'm gonna
take a breather.

01:19.550 --> 01:21.029
What? No.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.115
Sorry.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.685
I'm not yet in
the dancing mood.

01:27.130 --> 01:30.167
C'mon, Sarge! Dance with me.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.608
Why not.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.133
Where's Ivan tonight?

01:40.180 --> 01:42.045
He's working double
shifts all week.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.091
There are so few
engineers left.

01:44.140 --> 01:47.530
Any man with an essential job
works overtime these days.

01:48.670 --> 01:53.710
Oh, I didn't order this.

01:53.760 --> 01:58.060
Which leaves this place
to mellow men like him.

01:58.110 --> 02:01.022
For you Katie.
It's a Champagne cocktail.

02:01.070 --> 02:02.378
Real champagne?

02:02.420 --> 02:04.672
Well... it has bubbles.

02:08.250 --> 02:11.811
I'm going ringside to watch
the singer. Do you wanna come?

02:11.870 --> 02:13.679
I'm fine here.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.220
Who taught you to dance,
farm girl!?

02:21.270 --> 02:25.309
Taught myself on
the ice-box door!

02:25.360 --> 02:29.091
Then you better let me lead,
for Pete's sake?

02:29.140 --> 02:33.179
You're the best. I mean it.

02:33.240 --> 02:39.099
What do you know? You
got nothing to compare.

02:39.150 --> 02:41.584
I know whatI like.

02:41.630 --> 02:48.377
Hey. We're not alone.
Don't mess up a good thing.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.487
I am sweating up a
storm out there.

03:08.530 --> 03:11.749
A lady glows
or so they say.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.746
Well then me, I
glow like a pig.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.495
Say do you have a mint?

03:16.540 --> 03:19.919
I just had my second shandy
and the beer in this joint is
skunky.

03:19.980 --> 03:21.322
I may have some Choward's.

03:21.370 --> 03:23.235
You look familiar.
Where do you work?

03:23.290 --> 03:24.018
Victory Munitions.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.025
Oh, the office?

03:25.070 --> 03:26.628
Nope, the line.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.410
What's a buffed-up girl like you
doing working like a pit pony?

03:29.470 --> 03:31.677
Helping us win the war,
I hope.

03:31.730 --> 03:33.982
They must be pouring
on the steam nowadays.

03:34.030 --> 03:36.032
How often you got a
shipment going out?

03:36.080 --> 03:38.810
A train's out of the tunnel,
end of every night.

03:38.870 --> 03:41.907
Every night, huh?
Like clockwork?

03:41.960 --> 03:43.120
I guess so...

03:43.170 --> 03:45.821
Say, I hear they got a
new line starting up?

03:45.870 --> 03:47.918
You know anything about it?

03:47.960 --> 03:49.006
Why are you asking?

03:49.050 --> 03:52.008
I was just wondering
if they're hiring.

03:52.050 --> 03:55.520
They're always hiring.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.832
Here's a mint.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.017
Ta.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.762
You see that
girl over there?

04:13.810 --> 04:15.812
Which one, Princess?

04:15.860 --> 04:18.078
The red-head in the
burgundy dress,

04:18.120 --> 04:20.907
she was pummelling me with
questions about Vic Mu.

04:20.950 --> 04:23.680
War jobs are
glamourous to a girl.

04:23.740 --> 04:28.348
This was more than
just Idle chat.

04:28.390 --> 04:30.346
That girl was after something.

04:38.270 --> 04:39.965
Mom?

04:40.010 --> 04:41.147
Hello there, stranger!!

04:41.190 --> 04:43.624
Please, I've been in
nurses' res two weeks.

04:43.670 --> 04:44.830
Feels like an age.

04:44.890 --> 04:46.448
Is that a new lip colour?

04:46.500 --> 04:47.660
Pagoda Red.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.018
I'm not sure that's a
day-shade, dear.

04:50.070 --> 04:52.459
Just here to pick up
some warm clothes.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.286
Sit! Tell me_about
nurses' training.

04:54.330 --> 04:56.981
I can't. I've got my shift.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.941
How's the residence?

04:58.990 --> 05:01.208
The girls are great,
but I'm hardly there.

05:01.250 --> 05:03.298
We've started getting the
wounded in from Dieppe.

05:03.340 --> 05:04.853
I'm working
eighty-hour weeks.

05:04.910 --> 05:06.332
Eighty hours...?!

05:06.390 --> 05:09.689
They're desperate for
volunteers to help us.

05:09.740 --> 05:14.040
These poor boys. Paper keeps
revising casualty lists.

05:14.090 --> 05:15.819
To lose so many...

05:15.880 --> 05:19.782
I'll see ifI _can rustle
up some gIrls at the
factory to lend a hand.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.001
We could sure use 'em.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.357
When's Dad getting back?

05:23.410 --> 05:25.708
He insists on helping Uncle Ty
through the harvest.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.058
He's driving a team if
you can believe it.

05:28.110 --> 05:32.581
He'll be fine.
Stop worrying Mom.

05:32.630 --> 05:36.896
We'll trade nobody's going to
see me in that old thing.

05:36.940 --> 05:39.022
Thanks Mom.

05:39.070 --> 05:42.369
Sorry, I'll try and drop
by sometime next week.

05:42.420 --> 05:43.375
Duty calls.

05:54.090 --> 05:57.389
New Hitchcock at the Fox
Theatre, "Saboteur".

05:57.440 --> 05:59.613
Robert Cummings and
Priscilla Lane.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.082
Saw the trailer.

06:01.140 --> 06:04.098
Nazi spies set fire to
an airplane factory!

06:04.140 --> 06:07.746
It's all a frame-job,
Cummings is accused of being
an enemy agent

06:07.800 --> 06:09.836
And you know what
the poster says?

06:09.890 --> 06:13.974
"Every Jolting Scene is True!"

06:14.020 --> 06:18.013
Heck, they arrested
a Nazi spy-ring in
New York last spring.

06:18.070 --> 06:24.987
Apparently they were
gunning to blow up a
power plant in Niagara.

06:25.030 --> 06:27.419
I had such an odd
encounter last night.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.984
Really, I've had a
few of those myself.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.428
Not that kind!

06:31.470 --> 06:33.859
You know how they always say
there are spies out there,

06:33.910 --> 06:35.992
trying to get us to talk?

06:36.040 --> 06:37.564
Last night at the Jewel Box,

06:37.610 --> 06:40.909
this girl she kept asking
me about the plant.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.178
She wanted to know
about the new lab.

06:43.220 --> 06:44.300
Good luck to her.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.260
They keep that so hush-hush,

06:46.310 --> 06:50.872
I type their purchase orders
everyday and I don't even know
what we're making.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.968
Dieppe shattered so many lives.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.978
A few of your free
hours at the hospital,

06:59.020 --> 07:01.887
could make a world of _difference
to a lonely soldier.

07:01.940 --> 07:03.589
Clear.

07:03.640 --> 07:06.063
We'll have a couple
hours after shift and
before the show

07:06.120 --> 07:07.189
and Ivan's working.

07:07.250 --> 07:08.945
I'm meeting Teresa for a bite.

07:08.990 --> 07:11.458
Maybe we'll just see
you at the pictures?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.470
Miss McRae?
How about you?

07:19.520 --> 07:22.307
Sorry, Mrs. Corbett.
I got movie plans.

07:22.350 --> 07:24.079
Saboteur is opening tonight.

07:24.130 --> 07:27.088
Lest we forget what these
brave boys have sacrificed

07:27.140 --> 07:29.040
so that we _can all
go to the pictures.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.261
I'll get down later
this week.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.311
The boys'll be waiting.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.612
Suppose you have plans too,
Andrews?

07:35.670 --> 07:39.788
I... no, well,
not especially.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.410
So many young men,
lives changed.

07:42.460 --> 07:46.499
You could ease a loneliness.
Think about it.

07:46.550 --> 07:47.539
Clear.

07:52.860 --> 07:54.509
Excuse me.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.857
Sorry Ma'am,

07:55.910 --> 07:57.946
I was up half the night
fighting with my landlady.

07:57.990 --> 08:00.379
Things are still not working
out with your housing's?

08:00.430 --> 08:02.864
She came into my room
and unplugged my clock

08:02.910 --> 08:04.696
so I wouldn't_ run
up the electrical.

08:04.740 --> 08:08.471
That mean old bag of bones
is just looking for a reason
to throw me out.

08:08.530 --> 08:09.519
What's keeping you awake?

08:09.570 --> 08:11.049
Too much time on my hands.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.524
Lie awake dreaming up
things to worry about.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.048
You know what you
need to do, Ma'am?

08:16.100 --> 08:18.705
Go out and do it up,
have a rip-roar.

08:18.750 --> 08:22.231
At my age, I think I'll
leave it to someone else
to paint the town.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.713
Age doesn't make
any difference.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.718
Talk to me in twenty years
after three kids.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.672
Ma'am, all we get is a little
living, a little loving,

08:29.720 --> 08:32.416
and then a whole lot of dead.

08:32.460 --> 08:33.984
Clear.

08:35.210 --> 08:38.293
Stay sharp out there,
Miss Harrison.

08:43.560 --> 08:45.118
Gladys, c'mon.

08:45.170 --> 08:47.775
There won't be any hot-to-trot
soldiers to fend off tonight

08:47.830 --> 08:49.172
just us girls.

08:49.220 --> 08:52.041
Maybe. I don't know.

08:52.090 --> 08:54.081
What's to know?
It's Hitchcock!

08:54.140 --> 08:56.131
Maybe Gladys doesn't
feel like it.

08:56.180 --> 08:58.171
Gotta move on sometime.

09:02.710 --> 09:03.620
That's her.

09:03.670 --> 09:04.796
VVho?

09:04.840 --> 09:06.148
The redhead.

09:06.190 --> 09:07.589
From last night?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.234
What she doing here?

09:09.280 --> 09:14.320
Seems one way or another, she's
getting her questions answered.

09:17.550 --> 09:19.677
Hi.

09:19.730 --> 09:22.551
Remember me?

09:22.600 --> 09:25.421
Last night. I gave you a mint.

09:25.470 --> 09:28.689
Sorry? I don't know what
are you talking about?

09:28.740 --> 09:30.867
The Jewel Box.
In the powder room?

09:30.910 --> 09:33.344
Last night, I was
home with the hubby,

09:33.390 --> 09:35.438
listening to The Shadow
on the wireless.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.879
Don'tcha love that program?

09:36.920 --> 09:38.785
We're not hitting
the town much yet.

09:38.830 --> 09:40.616
We just moved up
from Bathurst.

09:40.660 --> 09:42.139
What are you
doing here now?

09:42.190 --> 09:43.487
Margie Lewis.

09:43.530 --> 09:46.442
I transferred in from
Red Shift this morning.

09:46.490 --> 09:48.219
Gladys Witham.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.838
I could have sworn.

09:49.890 --> 09:53.109
Bing'll get a kick out of this,
I've got a twin out there!

09:53.150 --> 09:54.629
She had the same red hair.

09:54.680 --> 09:58.320
She musta got it out of
the same red bottle.

10:10.390 --> 10:12.255
Vera !!

10:12.300 --> 10:14.768
Sit tight, he'll be up
in a minute.

10:14.830 --> 10:17.253
Ever since that fracas
over the missmg TNT,

10:17.310 --> 10:18.868
we've got a new
security protocol.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.262
You called, Mr. Aikins?

10:20.310 --> 10:23.097
Pull the employee file
on a Marnie...

10:23.140 --> 10:27.793
Margie or Margaret Lewis.
From Bathurst, New Brunswick.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.445
And the new security protocol?
Who runs it?

10:30.490 --> 10:31.832
Our new security man.

10:31.890 --> 10:34.529
Clifford Parry.

10:34.590 --> 10:37.195
Clifford Parry,
meet Gladys Witham.

10:37.240 --> 10:40.027
One knows the name,
of course.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.322
How do you do, Miss Witham.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.768
Uhh, well, thank you.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.597
Miss Witham was approached
last night by a woman

10:46.640 --> 10:48.369
asking suspicious questions
about the plant.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.944
She's just been spotted
on the factory floor.

10:50.990 --> 10:53.208
I think I saw her.

10:53.260 --> 10:54.249
Here or last night?

10:54.300 --> 10:56.382
Here. I know I saw
her last night.

10:56.430 --> 10:58.250
And here?

10:58.300 --> 11:00.996
I spoke to her here.

11:01.050 --> 11:06.226
I'm just not sure
it was... her.

11:06.270 --> 11:08.135
I see.

11:08.180 --> 11:10.262
You can point her out?

11:10.320 --> 11:11.446
Of course!

11:11.490 --> 11:12.445
Whenever you're ready.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.068
Gladys - Where is she?

11:28.550 --> 11:30.154
Clifford - Take your time.

11:30.210 --> 11:32.553
Gladys - She was on the
line pouring amatol.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.295
Clifford - Could she have moved?

11:34.340 --> 11:36.331
Gladys - She was over there.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.904
Gladys - And none of the
subs have changed.

11:38.950 --> 11:41.339
Clifford - So you
don't see her now?

11:41.390 --> 11:42.869
I spoke to her.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.299
Mr. Parry? Mr. Aikins asked
me to pull a file for you.

11:45.350 --> 11:46.829
Yes, do you have it?

11:46.880 --> 11:50.839
There isn't one. There is
no Margie Lewns at VIcMu.

12:01.540 --> 12:03.804
What they need most?
Is your time.

12:03.850 --> 12:07.229
Talk to them, read,
play cards.

12:07.290 --> 12:10.111
Feminine companionship, does
a soldier a world of good.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.889
Mrs. Corbett.
Happy for your help.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.942
Dr. Patel. A pleasure.

12:13.990 --> 12:15.685
Sorry, that's not the
appropriate word

12:15.730 --> 12:19.939
not that it's not a pleasure
seeing... you know.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.207
We appreciate your coming.
With these numbers returning,

12:22.260 --> 12:23.818
it's been a challenge.

12:23.870 --> 12:26.509
Yes, Sheila mentioned you have
her working round the clock.

12:26.570 --> 12:28.993
Mom, doctors don't
set our shifts.

12:29.050 --> 12:30.870
You're in good hands,
Mrs. Corbett.

12:30.920 --> 12:35.175
This way, ladies. Nurse Findlay
will give you assignments.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.017
I didn't expect
you to volunteer.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.847
You said it yourself, Sheila
all shoulders to the wheel.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.973
Besides, seems it's the
only way I can see you.

12:49.020 --> 12:50.499
Don't get your hopes up.

12:50.550 --> 12:52.541
I can't stand around chatting.

12:52.590 --> 12:54.729
Wait. I brought a few things.

12:54.770 --> 12:56.806
The brush-set Gramma gave you.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.988
Gloves, you're going to
need yours soon.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.905
Oh! And you forgot
Mr. Mullins.

13:01.950 --> 13:05.078
Mother, you can't do this!

13:05.130 --> 13:07.769
Sheila, you've slept
with him your whole life.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.469
There are men here, that are
fighting for their lives.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.262
I've got work to do.

13:21.190 --> 13:24.318
They call us the lucky ones.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.841
Can I get you some
refreshing water?

13:27.890 --> 13:29.790
Could go for
something stronger.

13:29.850 --> 13:33.581
I'm not sure that would be
good for you right now.

13:33.630 --> 13:34.892
This is better.

13:34.940 --> 13:38.808
Better would be dead.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.373
That's not true.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.947
You fought bravely
and for a good reason.

13:43.990 --> 13:47.903
You don't have a clue,
do you.

13:47.950 --> 13:49.508
Of course I do.

13:49.560 --> 13:55.954
We pay attention to what
goes on over there.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.299
We were supposed to land
before dawn.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.397
But there was a balls-up.

14:02.450 --> 14:08.138
Was bright as day before
we could run the rocks.

14:08.190 --> 14:12.889
They sent us in anyway.

14:12.930 --> 14:15.581
Let me fix these blankets.

14:15.630 --> 14:17.279
Jerry saw us coming.

14:17.330 --> 14:21.721
The Germans up on the cliff,
cut us to ribbons.

14:21.770 --> 14:22.759
Bullets flying,

14:22.810 --> 14:24.243
guys falling

14:24.290 --> 14:28.727
and all the while they
kept yelling go, go, go!

14:28.780 --> 14:32.989
And the rocks slippery as hell.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.953
But it wasn't water, was it.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.133
It was blood.

14:46.050 --> 14:47.745
All my buddies' blood.

14:54.190 --> 14:55.236
Why?

15:01.770 --> 15:02.759
Why?

15:13.170 --> 15:14.125
Kate - Mrs. Corbett?

15:14.170 --> 15:17.958
Yes. What. I'm... I'm fine.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.994
I've done my patriotic
duty for the day.

15:23.050 --> 15:24.005
Are you coming?

15:24.050 --> 15:26.006
Not yet.

15:26.050 --> 15:29.656
I'm sure you're providing
a welcome balm.

15:51.030 --> 15:53.760
Glad you made it, Princess.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.334
Onward and upward, Bets.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.039
Good evening, Sergeant Hill,

15:58.080 --> 15:59.945
Glad you could join us.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.558
Do you know Vera Burr?

16:01.610 --> 16:03.771
Oh our paths have
crossed at VicMu.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.560
Do you know how much longer
you'll be with us?

16:06.610 --> 16:08.339
Until they ship us
someplace else.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.356
You must be itching to
get overseas.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.130
I hear it's three men
to every woman.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.875
That'll be fun.

16:14.930 --> 16:18.354
So, what's the dope
on your spy gal?

16:18.410 --> 16:22.107
I told security everything
I know now it's up to them.

16:22.150 --> 16:23.583
Well, no mystery here.

16:23.630 --> 16:26.622
Five reels of Robert Cummings?
Sign me up.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.932
That man is one
hunk of heartbreak.

16:28.980 --> 16:33.337
Our new security man Clifford
Parry's no slouch either.

16:33.380 --> 16:36.110
The hair, those ties,
that accent...

16:36.160 --> 16:40.073
Vera he must be over
thirty-five!

16:40.120 --> 16:42.384
There's nothing wrong
with a distinguished gentlemen

16:42.430 --> 16:44.295
who knows his way around?

16:44.350 --> 16:48.309
These days, as long as
he's got all his parts and
some of his teeth?

16:48.350 --> 16:49.908
Vera, really.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.781
Just think about all those boys
who lost their lives in Dieppe

16:52.830 --> 16:55.219
put off all their
living 'til tomorrow.

16:55.270 --> 16:57.875
They have no tomorrows left.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.276
I'm not interested in
Clifford Parry.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.620
Perfect. Gets you back out there
no harm to the old ticker.

17:05.670 --> 17:08.059
Mrs. Corbett?

17:08.110 --> 17:09.839
Oh, good evening, ladies.

17:09.890 --> 17:11.289
Are you here alone?

17:11.330 --> 17:17.155
I was supposed to meet
friends but they cancelled.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.075
Sit with us.

17:19.120 --> 17:21.168
Doesn't look like
Kate will show.

17:21.210 --> 17:24.077
Oh, she's still at
the hospital.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.291
Well, then we'll
scooch over.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.955
Thank you, girls.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.651
Aren't these good seats.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.782
It's a fine view here.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.387
Hello.

18:07.430 --> 18:09.512
I'm Kate.

18:09.560 --> 18:14.645
Would you like some company?

18:14.700 --> 18:16.258
Like the news, do you?

18:19.310 --> 18:22.268
Seems someone stole
the funny pages.

18:22.310 --> 18:25.700
How 'bout I give this a read.
Yes?

18:25.750 --> 18:32.713
"Hundreds of Dieppe
soldiers are listed..."

18:32.760 --> 18:35.194
"Tuesday, September 15th."

18:35.240 --> 18:39.324
Partly cloudy with scattered
showers, fog throughout the
day tomorrow"

18:39.370 --> 18:45.764
That'll put a crimp
in our sailing plans.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.594
Let me find sports.

19:14.240 --> 19:21.328
Saboteur in a war factory
doesn't seem that far-fetched,
any more, does it?

19:33.430 --> 19:36.388
"It's funny business for
Morton Cooper,

19:36.430 --> 19:41.379
who planted a kiss on his
brother Walker after Morton
firing a three-hit,

19:41.440 --> 19:47.299
3-0 shutout at the
Brooklyn Dodgers."

19:47.360 --> 19:49.965
Or maybe you're more
football fan.

19:55.100 --> 19:57.660
Just give me a sign.

20:00.060 --> 20:01.846
That's Private Brennan.

20:01.890 --> 20:03.846
Hasn't uttered _a word
smce he arrived.

20:03.890 --> 20:07.371
So hard to find things in here
that aren't about the war.

20:07.420 --> 20:09.581
Most men here are
keen to keep up.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.279
They need to know their
sacrifice has meant something.

20:12.340 --> 20:13.557
What's he doing in there?

20:13.600 --> 20:15.204
He needs rest

20:15.250 --> 20:20.256
and someone like you letting
him know it's safe to come out.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.029
That's all I can do today.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.739
Maybe I'll see him
another time.

20:23.780 --> 20:26.658
He's not about to ask
you to come back.

20:26.700 --> 20:30.397
But I will.

20:39.490 --> 20:41.310
See you in the morning,
girls.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.496
Goodnight, Mrs. Corbett.

20:42.540 --> 20:45.327
Vera and I go this way,
see you later.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.759
Night.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.298
Who cares about
Bob Cummings?

20:58.340 --> 21:01.468
That Priscilla Lane
is ring-a-ding-ding.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.602
What happened to
"I know what I like"?

21:03.650 --> 21:07.825
I still do but I'm not dead.

21:07.870 --> 21:09.918
Hey girls! Looking
for some company?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.860
We're fine, handsome.
Thanks all the same.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.478
Hey! I'm talking to you.

21:13.530 --> 21:16.044
Hey! I hear you WAC's
go for a nickel.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.489
What's the matter? You
only do guys In uniform?

21:18.530 --> 21:19.576
Back off, creep.
Ignore him...

21:19.620 --> 21:21.099
What are ya? A
couple bulldaggers?

21:21.140 --> 21:22.482
What's it to you?

21:22.540 --> 21:24.792
Then I got something to
change your mind.

21:28.930 --> 21:31.364
Betty - I'm calling the police.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.489
What were you thinking?

21:32.550 --> 21:34.586
What? That creep put
his paws on you.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.585
Rule One is don't go
looking for trouble.

21:36.640 --> 21:40.201
I've got a lot at stake here
and you got a lot to learn.

21:40.250 --> 21:44.243
I keep my head down and I
keep my business to my self.

21:44.300 --> 21:47.167
Teresa, wait.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.309
I appreciate your cooperation,
Miss Witham.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.487
Take your time.
Look closely.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.966
Tell me if any of
these are the woman.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.406
That's her.

22:12.460 --> 22:15.327
Her hair is different,
but I'd swear to it.

22:15.370 --> 22:18.544
I would ask you not to
discuss this with others.

22:18.590 --> 22:21.195
If anyone asks, you're
not at liberty to say.

22:21.250 --> 22:22.376
Understood?

22:26.250 --> 22:29.208
Is there anything else,
Mr. Parry?

22:29.260 --> 22:31.478
I hope you weren't
offended the other night.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.737
The Champange

22:32.780 --> 22:35.431
Clumsy attempt to
gain an introduction.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.380
I didn't mean to be rude.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.567
It's just...

22:39.610 --> 22:41.953
I lost my fianc
three months ago.

22:42.010 --> 22:43.875
Very sorry.

22:43.920 --> 22:47.310
My friends are constantly
after me to get out.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.181
I try but it's not easy.

22:50.230 --> 22:52.186
And still you are here.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.845
More motivated than ever
to make those bombs.

22:54.890 --> 22:57.017
The war belongs to us all.

22:57.070 --> 22:58.412
We shirk our duty?

22:58.460 --> 23:01.509
They win, and what
does that get us?

23:01.550 --> 23:03.450
The way I honour James,

23:03.510 --> 23:05.728
and the men who died
on those beaches

23:05.770 --> 23:08.682
is to do more, not less.

23:08.730 --> 23:11.290
That's very admirable.

23:11.340 --> 23:15.253
I don't mean it to be.
It's just what I am doing.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.427
There's no way to
say this without

23:17.480 --> 23:20.438
sounding like a complete cad,

23:20.480 --> 23:23.950
I was wondering if you'd
like to have dinner.

23:24.010 --> 23:29.528
We _could continue to
discuss the case.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.401
So, Ma'am? You tear up
the town last night?

23:37.450 --> 23:39.668
I took myself to
the pictures.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.018
A show all on your lonesome?

23:42.070 --> 23:46.586
After a wild night like
that, hope they didn't bring
you home in a paddywagon.

23:46.640 --> 23:47.675
Very funny.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.334
Things with your
landlady any better?

23:49.380 --> 23:51.894
She thinks she's gonna get some
high-class white girl in there.

23:51.950 --> 23:54.339
I told her no high-class
girl's gonna

23:54.380 --> 23:56.382
put up with mice scratching
inside the walls.

23:56.430 --> 23:58.864
What kind of place
have they put you in?

23:58.910 --> 24:00.821
I'm calling the
Board of Health.

24:00.870 --> 24:02.565
No please. I'm okay.
Don't worry.

24:02.610 --> 24:05.170
Next pay-packet,
I'm buying a cat.

24:11.580 --> 24:12.911
No thank you.

24:14.190 --> 24:16.533
I feel I've spilled
my whole life-story

24:16.580 --> 24:18.707
and you've barely
said a word of yours.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.625
I don't know that
mine competes.

24:20.670 --> 24:23.662
Now... is that_
modesty or eva5ion?

24:23.720 --> 24:25.881
My life is long next to yours,

24:25.940 --> 24:28.067
and we're already done
the main course.

24:28.110 --> 24:31.375
I'll accept a precis.

24:31.420 --> 24:34.332
Born in London,
father was a banker;

24:34.380 --> 24:36.075
went to all the
right schools

24:36.120 --> 24:38.111
and ran with all
the wrong people.

24:38.170 --> 24:39.558
Now, this could get
interesting.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.556
After school, I knocked
about Europe

24:41.610 --> 24:44.477
trying to work as a journalist,
'til luckily,

24:44.520 --> 24:45.566
war broke out.

24:45.610 --> 24:46.736
How was that lucky?

24:46.780 --> 24:48.828
Feels as though I'm
being interviewed.

24:48.870 --> 24:51.486
Sorry.

24:51.530 --> 24:54.522
Years of training at
my mother's knee.

24:54.580 --> 24:57.310
At dinner, a lady's
one responsibility

24:57.360 --> 24:59.612
is to animate her chair,

24:59.670 --> 25:02.537
be companionable,
draw out her host.

25:02.580 --> 25:04.536
You're very good at it.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.319
'Til I started at the plant,

25:06.370 --> 25:09.362
it was the only thing
I was trained to do.

25:09.420 --> 25:10.193
Hardly an accomplishment.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.379
You underestimate yourself.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.254
Burk's Falls?

25:28.300 --> 25:29.779
Is that where you're from?

25:29.830 --> 25:31.604
I'm from up that way.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.605
Sure pretty country,
isn't it.

25:33.660 --> 25:37.300
You still have family there?

25:41.670 --> 25:44.969
What'dya think the folks
would be doing about now?

25:45.020 --> 25:46.362
Supper finished,

25:46.410 --> 25:49.015
in the front room probably,
listening to the radio.

25:49.060 --> 25:51.585
Or checkers, you think?

25:51.630 --> 25:55.157
Or maybe they're musical.
Do they play at all?

25:55.200 --> 25:57.589
Most folks up that way do.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.894
I bet your mom chords
on the paino,

26:00.950 --> 26:05.375
your dad on fiddle,
and all the children they sing.

26:05.430 --> 26:08.604
That's what we'd be
doing up at my place.

26:08.650 --> 26:13.599
It was rough times,
but it wasn't always bad.

26:19.660 --> 26:24.791
I had my voice taken
away from me once too.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.616
You can get it back.

26:30.850 --> 26:34.229
Someone is waiting for you.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.583
Someone needs you.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.372
There'll be better times.

26:57.740 --> 26:58.991
See that soldier?

26:59.050 --> 27:01.268
Buying his girl dinner?

27:01.310 --> 27:04.655
He's shipping out soon,
and she knows it.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.577
You can tell that from here?

27:07.620 --> 27:09.668
She's being brave.

27:09.710 --> 27:12.929
She wants him to have
something to hold on to.

27:12.970 --> 27:17.532
In case he has to
face his own Dieppe.

27:17.590 --> 27:22.323
I know we're suppose to
trust there's a reason
behind every mi55ion,

27:22.370 --> 27:26.670
but the seeming senselessness
of that battle.

27:26.730 --> 27:30.552
Have you ever been in a place
where there's no going forward,

27:30.600 --> 27:32.989
and no going back?

27:33.040 --> 27:36.771
What if following orders meant
the loss of hundreds of lives,

27:36.820 --> 27:41.302
maybe even your own.

27:41.350 --> 27:42.954
I would follow orders.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.343
In the face of death?

27:46.400 --> 27:47.355
Yes.

27:55.970 --> 27:56.925
I'm sorry,

27:56.970 --> 28:00.667
I'm no great dancer.

28:00.720 --> 28:05.635
Is it too forward to suggest
a leisurely drive home?

28:05.680 --> 28:08.763
Let me freshen up.

28:15.690 --> 28:17.294
I need the nearest telephone.

28:22.700 --> 28:25.123
You ran off last night.

28:25.180 --> 28:27.216
I wanted to see
the new Hitchcock.

28:27.270 --> 28:30.228
Since when do you
go to the pictures?

28:30.270 --> 28:34.798
In this movie,
there's a young girl.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.707
Gets herself mixed up
with a stranger.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.968
Narendra is not a stranger.

28:40.020 --> 28:41.442
Not to me.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.798
He's from a different country,
Sheila.

28:43.850 --> 28:45.363
Give me some credit will you.

28:45.410 --> 28:47.059
I know why you don't like him.

28:47.110 --> 28:51.376
I can't pretend to
be happy about this.

28:51.420 --> 28:52.762
How serious are you?

28:52.810 --> 28:54.892
He's lonely and so am I.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.510
Where could this
possibly be headed?

28:57.560 --> 28:59.516
Sheila, I thought
you were smarter.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.334
So what if we care
about each other?

29:01.390 --> 29:03.608
Will you have children
with this man?

29:03.650 --> 29:08.041
What world will you raise
them in? Think, Sheila!

29:08.090 --> 29:11.082
It can't work.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.745
Oh dear.

29:14.790 --> 29:16.348
Doctor Patel.

29:34.900 --> 29:37.368
That must mean I haven't
completely blown it.

29:37.420 --> 29:39.376
I know how it is.

29:39.420 --> 29:42.207
You got something going the
first time in your life

29:42.250 --> 29:44.810
and you want to shout it
from the rooftops.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.474
Aren't I allowed
to be happy?

29:46.520 --> 29:48.385
Just cuz there's
women everywhere,

29:48.430 --> 29:50.512
you think nobody notices us?

29:50.570 --> 29:52.435
They don't, Teresa.

29:52.480 --> 29:55.745
I won't risk my career,

29:55.790 --> 29:57.872
not even for you.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.618
Hey, I'll take a beer.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.802
Why are we stopping?

30:12.850 --> 30:16.456
Infiltration of high-security
installations is very real

30:16.510 --> 30:18.284
not just the stuff of movies.

30:18.330 --> 30:20.150
That's what I've been
telling everyone.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.509
Miss Witham, get out
of the car please.

30:22.550 --> 30:24.506
I don't think I will,
thank you.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.596
You told me you
could follow orders.

30:26.650 --> 30:30.427
If the objective was clear,
yes.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.948
What do you want from me?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.911
Your trust.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.303
Now get out of the car.

30:59.200 --> 31:04.240
I apologize for any
unintended offense.

31:04.290 --> 31:07.020
It's natural for mother
to protect her child.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.719
My mother would have said
the same about Sheila.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.031
Probably worse.

31:11.080 --> 31:13.071
Sheila is a very
special girl.

31:13.130 --> 31:15.086
My parents say the
same about me.

31:15.130 --> 31:17.598
We're Brahmin and I'm a doctor
with a Western education

31:17.650 --> 31:19.129
quite a catch back home.

31:19.180 --> 31:22.081
They would never consent to an
alliance they didn't arrange

31:22.140 --> 31:25.132
especially to a working-class
White girl like Sheila.

31:25.180 --> 31:27.171
Then maybe you should
listen to them.

31:27.230 --> 31:28.447
Oh, I do.

31:28.490 --> 31:30.003
They've already brokered
an arrangement for me.

31:30.060 --> 31:31.186
I beg your pardon?

31:31.230 --> 31:33.357
You're telling me
you're engaged?

31:33.410 --> 31:34.968
The wedding has been delayed.

31:35.020 --> 31:36.237
This is a joke.

31:36.280 --> 31:39.010
I have no doubt I'll
eventually marry the girl.

31:39.070 --> 31:41.675
And when did you think
you might tell Sheila

31:41.720 --> 31:43.028
about this fiance of yours?

31:43.070 --> 31:46.369
Mrs. Corbett.
Your daughter already knows.

31:46.420 --> 31:47.762
I don't believe you.

31:47.810 --> 31:49.027
I do care for Sheila.

31:49.080 --> 31:52.982
That is not the
daughter we've raised.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.292
You will excuse me.
I have rounds.

32:00.610 --> 32:03.522
I don't believe your story.

32:03.570 --> 32:06.084
A man with your accent
and that suit

32:06.140 --> 32:09.746
should be an officer
on the front-line.

32:09.790 --> 32:13.089
How can you be a
glorified security guard?

32:13.140 --> 32:15.358
When the war broke,
I joined the Navy.

32:15.410 --> 32:19.312
It was my journalistic
skill, set me apart for
special service:

32:19.370 --> 32:24.103
the ability to acquire and
interpret information.

32:24.150 --> 32:28.325
What's special service?

32:28.380 --> 32:30.109
I can say this much,

32:30.160 --> 32:34.688
we're on the same side.

32:34.730 --> 32:37.904
How am I supposed
to believe that?

32:40.130 --> 32:43.349
No single act of great heroism
will win us this war.

32:43.390 --> 32:46.917
It's a thousand, ten thousand
small ones.

32:46.960 --> 32:50.134
You can keep walking
or turn back.

32:50.180 --> 32:53.786
I'll take you to the car
and drive you home.

33:21.210 --> 33:31.176
There is a balm in Gilead
To make the wounded whole

33:34.220 --> 33:44.186
There is a balm in Gilead
To heal the sin sick soul

33:47.150 --> 33:49.971
What do you know it's the WAC
and her snack.

33:50.020 --> 33:51.191
Hey WAC!

33:51.240 --> 33:52.229
On your way boys.

33:52.290 --> 33:53.587
Shut your face, mounth!

33:53.640 --> 33:54.288
Watch it.

33:54.330 --> 33:55.376
Or what, tough girl?

33:55.420 --> 33:58.287
This your fun for the night?
Pathetic.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.161
Now, you're getting it!

34:02.210 --> 34:04.462
Get her in the
car!! In the car!

34:07.170 --> 34:07.773
Betty.

34:25.360 --> 34:35.326
There is a balm in Gilead
That heals the sin sick soul

34:54.700 --> 34:57.863
It's okay Davey.

34:58.790 --> 35:01.179
It's gonna be okay.

35:16.020 --> 35:19.899
Head back it needs the ice.

35:19.940 --> 35:21.100
I wanna see.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.285
Who are those guys?

35:24.330 --> 35:25.934
We didn't swap calling cards.

35:25.990 --> 35:27.150
Called us dirty names.

35:27.210 --> 35:30.589
And slugger here
couldn't walk away.

35:30.650 --> 35:33.255
You're blaming me
for this Teresa?

35:33.300 --> 35:36.167
I'll get some more ice.

35:42.920 --> 35:46.265
This is why you need
to be careful.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.914
Let me see.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.407
What's that for?

35:59.460 --> 36:00.802
Being a hero.

36:00.850 --> 36:03.671
I'm not trying to be a hero.

36:03.720 --> 36:07.542
Trying to live my life.

36:35.280 --> 36:35.871
Her.

36:35.930 --> 36:37.227
Hello again, Gladys.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.838
Gladys, stop.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.141
She's on our side.

36:40.190 --> 36:41.748
And what side is that?

36:41.800 --> 36:44.325
Stay put and I'll explain.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.678
What do you want?

36:45.720 --> 36:48.678
War is changing now
more than ever before,

36:48.720 --> 36:52.065
maybe won or loss on the
strength of the intelligence
we gather.

36:52.120 --> 36:57.683
There's important work
going on at VicMu.

36:57.730 --> 36:59.425
What kind of work?

36:59.470 --> 37:04.954
Suffices to say, we need eyes
and ears inside the plant.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.956
What about her?

37:07.000 --> 37:09.264
Margaret was testing security.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.528
The discretion of
the factory girls.

37:11.570 --> 37:12.741
She's been reassigned.

37:12.790 --> 37:16.578
I got sloppy.
It won't matter again.

37:16.620 --> 37:19.225
What do you need
me to do?

37:19.280 --> 37:24.274
If you agree to help us
all I need you to do is go back
to your regular life.

37:24.320 --> 37:27.062
Explain away Margie to your
family and friends.

37:27.110 --> 37:30.284
Make sure that no one
suspects anything.

37:30.330 --> 37:31.763
And then what?

37:31.810 --> 37:34.324
And wait for my call.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.398
When you were my age,
you were married with
three children.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.704
And I didn't know a damn thing.

37:57.750 --> 38:00.799
Don't waste your affection,
Sheila.

38:00.840 --> 38:04.571
Don't throw away your youth on a
man with no future to offer.

38:04.630 --> 38:06.313
I don't care about the future.

38:06.370 --> 38:10.238
Whatever happiness life has for
me, it might only happen now.

38:10.280 --> 38:13.408
That doctor, he's promised
to somebody else.

38:13.460 --> 38:15.064
We are together now

38:15.110 --> 38:17.374
and everything
else could change.

38:17.420 --> 38:22.460
Can't you see, Sheila, he's
taking advantage of you of this
whole situation.

38:22.510 --> 38:23.818
I don't care.

38:23.860 --> 38:26.556
Narendra is smart, he's loving.

38:26.600 --> 38:30.297
And he thinks that I am too
so just let me be happy.

38:30.350 --> 38:33.217
And try, try to be happy for me.

38:33.260 --> 38:37.264
You can't ask a mother to
sit and watch someone
hurt her child.

38:37.310 --> 38:42.964
You're going to have to
otherwise you're not going to
have me in your life.

38:47.410 --> 38:50.015
How could you have change
so much overnight?

38:50.060 --> 38:51.311
It wasn't overnight.

38:51.370 --> 38:53.497
You just weren't
paying attention.

39:08.860 --> 39:11.511
I can't believe they
just attacked you.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.165
What're you saying,
Princess? I asked for it?

39:14.220 --> 39:15.346
I deserved my licks?

39:15.390 --> 39:17.210
No, of course not.

39:18.610 --> 39:21.135
Are you okay to go into work?

39:21.180 --> 39:23.398
Yeah, I'm okay.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.227
I could do without all the
gawking and gum flappin'.

39:26.270 --> 39:29.398
People talk, Betty.
You can't stop it.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.793
Yeah. And they like
to think the worst.

39:31.840 --> 39:35.401
They look at me and see a
girl who's crossing lines.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.974
Have you told Mrs. Corbett?

39:38.020 --> 39:41.365
She's always saying I
gotta be a role-model.

39:41.420 --> 39:44.765
Wait till she gets
a load of this.

39:44.810 --> 39:47.370
We better get in.

39:47.420 --> 39:48.409
Yep.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.984
Time to face the music.

40:05.700 --> 40:06.951
Let's go Bets.

40:15.230 --> 40:17.312
What the heck happen to her?

40:17.370 --> 40:18.758
Fun night on the town McRae?

40:18.800 --> 40:21.928
Who did you try and kiss?

40:21.980 --> 40:24.289
I wanna see the other guy.

40:34.080 --> 40:35.559
Miss McRae.

40:42.610 --> 40:45.249
It is despicable...

40:45.310 --> 40:49.872
here we have decent
hard-working women

40:49.920 --> 40:52.263
who are giving their all
for the war-effort.

40:52.310 --> 40:55.609
And yet they can't walk this
city's streets without

40:55.670 --> 41:00.790
interference from
good-for-nothing layabouts.

41:00.840 --> 41:03.149
It's a disgrace.

41:03.190 --> 41:07.968
I hope on behalf of us all,

41:08.030 --> 41:12.729
that you gave those beggars
every bit as good as you got.

41:12.770 --> 41:17.548
I certainly did my best,
Ma'am.

41:17.600 --> 41:27.566
[Clapping]

41:39.540 --> 41:42.441
Private Brennan's wife has
come to take him home.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.139
Isn't that wonderful?

41:45.190 --> 41:46.976
His wife?

41:55.460 --> 41:58.372
Sheila - I_ had them deliver
your things downstairs.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.158
Remember Gilead, Davey.

42:04.600 --> 42:07.034
The men say you're
quite the singer.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.514
I think they're
counting on an encore.

42:18.530 --> 42:23.741
Lorna - Got all these beds free,
seems unpatriotic not to
make use of them.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.405
Are you sure you
want me here?

42:26.450 --> 42:30.454
I am Reggie. I can use
the company.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.058
What room should I take?

42:32.110 --> 42:34.578
Uh, the boys' room,
down the hall.

42:34.630 --> 42:38.111
Sheila may need hers still.

42:38.160 --> 42:40.151
I'm putting the kettle on.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.589
You heading out or do you
have time for a cup?

42:42.640 --> 42:44.028
I'm a Maritimer, Missus

42:44.080 --> 42:48.517
always ready for a chin-wag
and a good strong cuppa.

42:53.220 --> 42:55.381
Verra - We were so busy
worrying about Betty,

42:55.440 --> 42:59.080
I forgot to ask you about your
big date with Clifford.

42:59.140 --> 43:01.040
You were right about Mr. Parry.

43:01.100 --> 43:04.968
It was the perfect warm-up
date for a girl whose
heart is on the mend.

43:05.010 --> 43:06.568
Meaning?

43:06.620 --> 43:10.147
Meaning, it was a nice dinner
and a quiet drive home.

43:10.190 --> 43:10.793
That's all?

43:10.840 --> 43:11.795
That's all.

43:11.850 --> 43:13.624
No sparks?

43:13.670 --> 43:15.626
I'm sorry to disappoint.

43:15.680 --> 43:18.547
What about a tid
bit on spy girl?

43:18.590 --> 43:19.670
Nope.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.153
Gladys, you gotta give
me something here.

43:21.200 --> 43:22.929
It's just how these things go.

43:22.990 --> 43:24.981
We'll probably never
hear anything more.

43:25.030 --> 43:27.817
I just can't believe that's
the end of the story.

43:27.860 --> 43:30.112
V_era. There's
nothing else to say.

43:30.170 --> 43:34.948
Vera - Well you gotta wonder how
many of those snooping red-heads
are still here.
