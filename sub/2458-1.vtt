00:20.551 --> 00:24.223
Everything is so difficult. I just...

00:59.926 --> 01:01.417
Over there.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.095
Sylvia...

01:12.138 --> 01:14.509
My goodness.

01:31.106 --> 01:36.095
Marcello, come here. Hurry up.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.159
Sylvia...

02:13.866 --> 02:15.603
What do you mean, Monday?

02:15.703 --> 02:19.071
...it was supposed to be
taken off last Monday...

02:20.973 --> 02:23.277
Well, because my
father's arriving today.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.914
No, I told you I cannot do Monday...

02:27.014 --> 02:30.351
I'm not afraid to get off myself.
Hey, be careful with that mirror!

02:31.518 --> 02:33.987
Could you take down the "for sale"
sign on the windows upstairs, please?

02:34.087 --> 02:36.590
They're all the way on the third floor,
ma'am. How am I supposed to do that?

02:36.690 --> 02:40.094
Well, I'm not a super, am I?
That goes right upstairs.

02:40.194 --> 02:44.865
Taco, get me a ladder.
Yeah, I know. I hate ladders.

02:44.965 --> 02:47.901
I'm always falling off them,
but this woman is driving me crazy.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.005
Armande, is that the woman
who's moving in next door to me?

02:51.105 --> 02:54.341
No, she's not the woman who's moving in.
Thank God she lives in the suburbs.

02:54.441 --> 02:57.845
It's her father. Her mother
passed away, she wants him nearby.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.112
- Oh, what a shame.
- Yeah.

03:32.879 --> 03:36.116
Okay, good. So, come on in.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.439
If you want to change
into your work clothes,

03:39.559 --> 03:41.569
you can use the room right back there.

03:41.831 --> 03:43.957
I'm already in my work clothes.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.261
Okay. Okay, great. All right.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.395
Remember, my father's going
to be here any minute now.

03:52.132 --> 03:55.769
This move is entirely pointless.
I was doing fine in my own home.

03:55.869 --> 03:59.305
This is your own home, Fred. Your daughter
moved you here for your own good.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.244
What does my daughter know?
I don't even know what's for my own good.

04:02.344 --> 04:04.845
- How does she know?
- That'll be $9.80.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.278
Do you got a ten?
I only carry big bills.

04:15.121 --> 04:19.058
Fred. It's apartment 3-D.

04:23.962 --> 04:24.932
What?!

04:25.032 --> 04:29.034
So, Michael, do you think
that it looks better here,

04:29.871 --> 04:35.009
or does it look better over here? So?

04:35.809 --> 04:38.543
Did grandma look that pissed
off when she was young, too?

04:41.581 --> 04:42.950
What happened to the car?

04:43.050 --> 04:45.018
Were you guys going to ever
answer your cell phone?

04:45.118 --> 04:47.187
- Where have you been?
- It took me two hours to convince him.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.056
He didn't want to come. He's stubborn
as a mule. What happened to my car?

04:50.156 --> 04:51.525
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Come here. Come over here.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.961
I left it with you for one hour, Lydia.
One hour. Look at this. Come here.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.364
Are you out of your mind?
It is not your car.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.033
- It's my car, too.
- Look at it.

04:59.133 --> 05:02.769
- Oh, my God. Who did that?
- You've wrecked my car.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.803
I left that car with you for one hour,
and look what happened.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.343
- I'm Laverne. Nice to meet you.
- Who are you, exactly?

05:09.443 --> 05:13.413
- Maybe just somebody passing by.
- It was an old lady in an orange car.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.815
- What?
- What old lady?

05:30.396 --> 05:31.765
Yeah, who is this woman?

05:32.747 --> 05:34.835
Yes. That's Laverne.

05:34.935 --> 05:38.472
I found her here, and it
turns out she's wonderful.

05:38.572 --> 05:42.343
What do you mean you found her? The people
who lived here before, left her here?

05:42.443 --> 05:45.746
Oh, no. Around here. She lives nearby.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.949
Oh, okay. That means she's
going back home, now.

05:49.049 --> 05:52.852
Well, yes, but maybe sometimes she'll
come back to keep you company.

05:52.952 --> 05:58.058
"Come back". This is a home caregiver...
Sorry. No offense.

05:58.158 --> 06:03.196
You wouldn't, by any chance, be confusing
me with some elderly, mental defective?

06:03.296 --> 06:05.599
I can look after myself
very well, thank you,

06:05.699 --> 06:08.835
but I cannot have a
random person in the house.

06:08.935 --> 06:13.307
But Dad, you can't do
everything alone. I'll worry.

06:13.407 --> 06:16.143
And I have to be stressed out
so you don't have to worry?

06:16.243 --> 06:18.946
Sorry. I didn't mean to be offensive.

06:19.246 --> 06:22.349
But I will not have that woman
wandering all over my house!

06:22.449 --> 06:24.985
Oh, hey! Okay.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.155
We'll send her away,
but you have to go tell her.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.154
No problem.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.763
Now, now, listen.
You look here, now.

06:37.063 --> 06:41.102
I already quit my other job.
What am I supposed to do now?

06:42.002 --> 06:45.203
Well, I don't... I mean...

06:49.076 --> 06:52.913
- Don't tell me you're late.
- No, I'm on my way.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.549
Mom, I postponed a meeting
at work to go in with you.

06:55.649 --> 06:59.386
Oh, dear, sweet, wonderful son.
Oh, you shouldn't have done that.

06:59.486 --> 07:03.757
I told you I can go by myself.
I know the whole deal by now.

07:03.857 --> 07:07.394
- They know me there. I know them.
- Mom, I worry.

07:07.494 --> 07:11.757
If I have a problem, I'll call you
and you can come and pick me up.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.335
No, no. Not the books.
I'll do those, honest.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.805
Well, that means I'm going to do it.

07:17.905 --> 07:22.843
Now, look. Let's get one thing straight.
I'll stay off your back if you stay off mine.

07:22.943 --> 07:26.513
Fine with me. What does
"stay off your back" mean to you?

07:26.613 --> 07:28.682
Well, it means if you want
to keep working here,

07:28.782 --> 07:31.952
anything my daughter tells
you to do, you don't do.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.855
Well, I'm supposed to take
care of all your needs.

07:34.955 --> 07:39.292
Cooking and cleaning, that's okay.
I don't like that much,

07:39.392 --> 07:43.596
- but what else did she tell you to do?
- Make you take a walk in the morning,

07:43.696 --> 07:46.899
- and again in the afternoon.
- Like a dog? That's not happening.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.236
- And then...
- Then what?

07:49.836 --> 07:52.039
To make sure you change
your underwear every day.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.708
- Do you have children?
- Yes.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.311
A baby girl. She lives in
Pittsburgh with my sister.

07:58.611 --> 08:01.982
Yeah, no. I can't see that.
I haven't got my glasses.

08:02.082 --> 08:07.114
Just enjoy her while she's still small
and hasn't picked some idiot to marry.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.557
And that must not be touched.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.859
Dad? Dad, I'm back.

08:12.959 --> 08:18.999
Hi. Got pizza. And as of tomorrow,
you buy groceries, okay?

08:19.299 --> 08:24.237
Well, you should really go for a walk
in the park, Dad. It's so beautiful.

08:24.437 --> 08:28.241
- Are you feeling better now, Mom?
- No, I'm fine. I'm perfect.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.912
I only called you because I knew
you were going to call me.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.712
What's life without your mother?

08:36.482 --> 08:38.123
Thank you, dear.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.623
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

08:43.722 --> 08:45.590
- Evening.
- Evening.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.560
Come on. Move it, Mike.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.032
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.334
Yes. Inside, first. Talk later.

08:55.334 --> 08:59.172
I got the bank statement today,
and it shows a cash withdrawal.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.572
What did you need that money for?

09:02.575 --> 09:05.645
Oh, God, is it cold in here,
or is it me?

09:05.745 --> 09:08.815
Don't change the subject, Mom.
I just want to know what you spent it on.

09:08.915 --> 09:12.419
Oh, living. What else would
I spend it on, dear?

09:12.519 --> 09:16.056
- We're talking about $2,000.
- Would you like the card back?

09:16.856 --> 09:20.393
It's not what I'm saying. I just
want to know what you spent it on.

09:20.493 --> 09:23.230
Well, are you going to stay for dinner?

09:23.330 --> 09:25.465
- Because I...
- Answer me.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.535
- What?
- You helping Alec out again?

09:28.635 --> 09:33.406
No. Now, what has Alec got to do with it?
He's your younger brother.

09:33.506 --> 09:37.976
You've always blamed him.
I think that I'd better get that.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.418
I'm calling the police.
Not only did you damage our car,

09:44.518 --> 09:47.420
but you threatened a minor.
Do you know that that's a felony?

09:47.520 --> 09:51.124
Well, I've never even set
eyes on this particular minor.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.093
- What's going on here?
- She's crazy.

09:53.193 --> 09:57.631
I am certainly not crazy.
This afternoon... is she your mother?

09:57.731 --> 10:00.299
- No.
- Yes. Yes, she is. Please, just...

10:00.399 --> 10:03.904
This afternoon,
your mother rammed into our car,

10:04.004 --> 10:06.373
and then she drove off without
leaving so much as a note.

10:06.473 --> 10:09.209
Oh, well, that's ridiculous.
It's not true.

10:09.309 --> 10:13.446
Oh, really? Okay, you have
an orange car, am I right?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.248
- Well, no.
- Mom.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.760
My son saw the whole thing.

10:18.260 --> 10:20.433
Will you stop threatening my son?

10:20.533 --> 10:23.390
Okay, ma'am, please just calm down.
My mother's an old lady.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.827
I'll calm down once I get
her full insurance details.

10:26.927 --> 10:30.490
- Okay. Mom, go get your insurance papers.
- No, I can't.

10:30.590 --> 10:32.933
- Why not?
- Because I hadn't made the payment.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.434
God.

10:34.534 --> 10:37.304
Do you mean to tell me that you've
been driving around with no insurance?

10:37.404 --> 10:40.674
- You could have killed somebody.
- But I didn't kill anyone.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.844
- It's just a headlight.
- Two headlights, and a fender.

10:43.944 --> 10:47.013
All right. Okay. I'll take care of this.
Just get an estimate, and give me a call.

10:47.113 --> 10:50.381
- Okay? Thank you.
- Drive off in a heat.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.231
Mom...

10:54.454 --> 10:58.291
Two lousy headlights, and then,
"my mother is an old lady."

10:58.391 --> 11:00.360
You could have kept that
one to yourself, dear.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.964
- Please, I was just saying that...
- If that woman parked her car

11:04.064 --> 11:08.435
right next to me, right up against me,
what has my age got to do with it?

11:08.535 --> 11:11.538
I mean, if I was 20, would that
mean she wouldn't park there?

11:11.638 --> 11:16.243
When she calls with the bill,
I will tell you the exact amount.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.680
Now, I'm going to leave
the check blank, okay?

11:19.780 --> 11:23.416
- You just fill it in and give it to her.
- I don't know where she lives.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.353
- Isn't she the new neighbor?
- No, that's her father.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.355
Okay, so, all right. Give it to him.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.622
- What's he like?
- I don't know. I've never seen him.

12:06.325 --> 12:07.494
Hello?

12:07.594 --> 12:09.896
I called three times already.
Why weren't you picking up?

12:09.996 --> 12:13.600
- Because I knew it was you, dear.
- Thanks. Are you okay?

12:13.700 --> 12:14.901
Oh, peachy.

12:15.101 --> 12:19.372
All right, look, your neighbor's
daughter called with a quote for the car.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.642
- $1,500.
- $1,500?

12:22.742 --> 12:26.279
- Wait, well, let me speak to them.
- No, no, no. No. Let it go, okay?

12:26.379 --> 12:31.051
Just write the check and forget about it.
Oh, and not this coming Sunday,

12:31.151 --> 12:35.021
but the following Sunday is Carla's
birthday, and I'm telling you now...

12:35.221 --> 12:38.825
Since when have I ever forgot
my granddaughter's birthday?

12:38.925 --> 12:41.128
- Since last year.
- Well, I was away.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.263
I had something to do. I don't remember.

12:43.363 --> 12:47.432
Two Sundays from today.
I'll pick you up at 9:00. Write it down.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.237
...cooperation are enormous.

12:51.337 --> 12:54.041
And of course, I very much
appreciated the chancellor's views

12:54.141 --> 12:57.777
on the financial situation in Europe,
which we agreed could not be allowed

12:57.877 --> 13:01.412
to put the global
economic recovery at risk.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.251
Oh, hello.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.754
Mr. Barcroft, you got company.

13:08.354 --> 13:11.624
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Yes?

13:12.424 --> 13:16.997
I'm Elsa. I'm Elsa Hayes. I live in
apartment A, right around the corner.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.330
Frederick Barcroft.

13:20.833 --> 13:24.537
- ...join with Germany and our NATO allies...
- Could you turn that down a tad?

13:24.637 --> 13:27.004
...in their political and
economic efforts to...

13:28.274 --> 13:32.178
- What can I do for you, Mrs....?
- Hayes.

13:32.278 --> 13:35.315
I'd like to give this check to your daughter,
and you can call me "Elsa."

13:35.415 --> 13:37.517
Oh, yes. The car.
Yes, my daughter told me.

13:37.617 --> 13:41.187
You know, it's rather excessive,
you know, $1,500.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.757
I'm sorry, what are you implying?

13:43.857 --> 13:47.293
Well, two headlights
should not cost $1,500.

13:47.393 --> 13:52.732
You know, I could feed my grandchildren
for a month, or maybe two, on this.

13:53.532 --> 13:56.603
Five children and widowed father,
and unemployed.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.539
- Your daughter passed away?
- No, my daughter-in-law.

13:59.639 --> 14:03.143
She was so beautiful.
Taken very, very young.

14:03.943 --> 14:07.480
And I try to help as much
as I can, with my pension.

14:07.980 --> 14:11.117
Of course, there's April.
April's the youngest,

14:11.217 --> 14:14.154
and she had meningitis as a baby.
She'll never walk.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.323
Well, I'm sorry. I had no idea.

14:17.423 --> 14:21.060
Well, how would you?
Is this your wife?

14:21.160 --> 14:22.295
Yes.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.765
She's... beautiful.

14:26.365 --> 14:30.270
- Is it true that she's no longer with us?
- That's correct.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.373
Well, I'm a widow, too. 27 years.

14:33.973 --> 14:37.107
- And you?
- Seven months.

14:38.644 --> 14:42.415
The first year's the most painful,
but you'll get over it.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.650
I'm already over it.
We hated each other.

14:50.155 --> 14:51.656
Well...

14:54.126 --> 14:57.330
Now, if you need anything,
you call me and I'm right next door.

14:57.430 --> 15:01.201
Yes, I already pay a lady to
ask me if I need anything

15:01.301 --> 15:05.200
and to hear me say that I don't.

15:06.639 --> 15:09.373
I don't think you don't need anything.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.676
Everybody needs something.

15:14.179 --> 15:15.213
Okay.

15:16.615 --> 15:19.850
Well, I promised to take
April to the pediatrician.

15:23.688 --> 15:24.958
Well...

15:25.058 --> 15:29.126
that is a calloused, mean, old man.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.229
Ma'am...

15:32.598 --> 15:34.967
- He said to give this back to you.
- Yeah?

15:35.067 --> 15:36.369
He said you can pay him the
money when you have it.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.838
He said that grandchildren are
more important than a car.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.507
Well...

15:40.707 --> 15:42.976
that's very generous of him,
but I can't accept it.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.078
Ma'am, if I was you, I'd take
it before he changes his mind.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.546
Yeah.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.213
A bear with angel wings.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.818
Artichoke with a tender heart.

15:56.823 --> 16:01.483
A porcupine... with the
sweetness of a panda.

16:18.076 --> 16:21.948
I'm going to the store.
Anything you'd like in particular?

16:22.048 --> 16:25.618
Yeah, to be 30 years younger and
have a prostate the size of a peanut.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.254
- Thank you, Laverne.
- Okay, I'll check it out.

16:28.354 --> 16:30.021
See what they can do.

17:05.424 --> 17:09.329
- Poor man? He's sick.
- No, he ain't sick.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.231
Then why is he in bed all day?

17:11.731 --> 17:14.632
I don't know. He's tired.

17:15.835 --> 17:19.506
No, no. Something must be done,
because you can't just let a man just...

17:19.606 --> 17:23.009
him... cast himself out like that.

17:23.108 --> 17:26.279
Well, I tried, but you know,
he's kind of stubborn.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.290
Stubborn?

17:29.449 --> 17:31.885
Oh. That's a challenge.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.988
So, did that old lady across the
hall ever give you the check?

17:35.088 --> 17:36.089
Nope.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.324
Really? Because I spoke
to her son about it.

17:38.424 --> 17:40.325
She gave me cash.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.598
That is strange.

17:45.798 --> 17:49.102
I mean, I thought it was going to be really
hard to get money out of that old bag.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.434
And you were wrong.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.540
Count it.

17:54.740 --> 18:00.079
So, to what do I owe this visit?
Everyone all dolled up to the nines.

18:00.479 --> 18:02.549
Well, we just wanted to
see how you were doing,

18:02.649 --> 18:05.251
and see how you were
getting along with Laverne.

18:05.351 --> 18:08.450
Well, was an entire convention really
necessary to find out how things

18:08.550 --> 18:10.590
were going with Laverne? I mean,
you could have called me and said,

18:10.690 --> 18:13.626
"How are things with Laverne?"
And I would have said, "Fine."

18:14.460 --> 18:16.296
- Come on, Dad.
- Jack...

18:16.796 --> 18:19.098
What makes you think
you can call me "Dad"?

18:19.598 --> 18:21.768
I mean, you've been in
the family for 15 years.

18:21.868 --> 18:26.136
Even you should have understood
by now that I'm not your father.

18:28.163 --> 18:29.574
Okay, Dad.

18:30.743 --> 18:35.148
There is... a business
that we'd like get into.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.314
I'll explain.

18:37.749 --> 18:42.288
Fred, I want you to imagine
a big warehouse

18:42.388 --> 18:46.557
and the rights to launch an
awesome product into the market.

18:47.559 --> 18:48.783
Ladies and gentlemen...

18:50.463 --> 18:54.168
"Never ever lose" glasses.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.537
For the absent-minded.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.137
Also...

19:01.607 --> 19:03.343
They're indestructible.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.845
But with this...

19:06.970 --> 19:08.346
found them.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.185
And just till you lose
the remote control.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.887
Is there a remote control
to find the remote control?

19:14.987 --> 19:19.192
Good question.
And a handy, convenient chain...

19:19.792 --> 19:22.562
to wear around your neck
so it stays with you always.

19:22.962 --> 19:27.324
Well, why can't we wear our glasses
around our neck and cut out the middleman?

19:28.401 --> 19:32.505
Well, Dad, we wanted to know if you might
want to invest some money in the idea.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.857
And we'll do all the work.
You just have to sit back

19:34.957 --> 19:38.108
and collect your fat dividend
at the end of the year.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.913
How much will it cost me?

19:42.839 --> 19:44.412
$60,000.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.994
Talk to him. Talk to him.

19:56.529 --> 20:00.767
- Hey, Dad. Your hand hurt?
- No, no. No, no.

20:01.767 --> 20:05.071
You know, Dad, I've never
asked you for any help.

20:05.171 --> 20:08.374
I know that. You're asking
help for your husband,

20:08.474 --> 20:11.811
whom you know I love as
much as sciatic nerve pain.

20:11.911 --> 20:16.582
- Yeah, well, I really love him.
- Well, that is a complete mystery to me.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.735
Well, I know it might seem strange
to you, Dad, but when I'm with him,

20:19.835 --> 20:23.456
I just feel like...
I'm not afraid of anything.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.827
But you should be afraid of
exactly that, being with him.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.496
He's so sleazy.

20:30.596 --> 20:35.735
Well, it's not just us
that we're asking for.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.804
There is Michael, his future.

20:37.904 --> 20:41.842
Yeah, all right, all right,
all right already. I'll think about it.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.178
Thanks, Dad.

20:45.678 --> 20:51.249
Oh, and by the way,
it's not $60,000. It's $90,000.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.279
What do you want?

21:09.379 --> 21:12.605
- Who let you in?
- Mom gave me the keys.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.708
No, of course. Anyone can come
into my house as they please.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.344
- It's a seaport.
- Sorry.

21:18.444 --> 21:22.246
No, no, no, no. You're all right.
You can stay.

21:25.483 --> 21:29.955
Oh, boy, do you stink. Whoa. God.

21:30.431 --> 21:32.758
Smell that? I'm becoming a man.

21:33.258 --> 21:35.761
Listen, Grandpa, Mom sent me...

21:35.861 --> 21:38.197
Don't tell me you've come
here to take me out.

21:38.397 --> 21:41.734
- There's a nice park nearby.
- "There's a nice park."

21:41.834 --> 21:44.504
Why's everybody keep
talking about this park?

21:44.604 --> 21:49.642
I mean, what's so great about this park?
Sitting on a bench, looking like an idiot.

21:49.742 --> 21:54.746
Sweet, wonderful grandson,
don't you understand?

21:54.846 --> 21:59.152
Grandpa doesn't want to go out.
He's fine at home.

21:59.252 --> 22:03.354
I figured you wouldn't want to go out,
so I came with a plan B.

22:08.460 --> 22:14.000
Mom, it's so hard to get taken seriously
as an artist... without a backer.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.437
Didn't Sebastian say you could
do a show whenever you wanted?

22:17.537 --> 22:20.840
Yeah, and soon as I show up to ask him,
he says to me, "you're welcome,

22:20.940 --> 22:23.609
- as long as you cough up the cash."
- Well, how much does he want?

22:23.709 --> 22:27.713
A lot, and they only do exhibitions
with other artists. It's not worth it.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.849
Money, money, money.

22:30.049 --> 22:33.286
Or... well, what are we talking
about here, dear? How much?

22:33.786 --> 22:35.452
$1,500 up front.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.409
- Who's that?
- F.B.I.

22:40.026 --> 22:43.729
- Raymond, what a surprise.
- Did you give him the check?

22:43.829 --> 22:46.615
Well, I went over, but he wasn't there.

22:46.715 --> 22:50.102
- Mom, where are you?
- I'm in a museum,

22:50.202 --> 22:53.405
and I can't talk right now, dear,
because I have a man glaring at me.

22:53.905 --> 22:55.339
- Mom?
- Bye.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.445
Pretty soon he'll put
a private eye on me.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.055
Okay, I'll ask for the check.

23:02.315 --> 23:04.982
You're paying, right?
I don't have a dime.

23:11.157 --> 23:14.260
Mrs. Hayes! Please, please.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.462
I need help.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.698
- Just a minute.
- Mrs. Hayes!

23:18.898 --> 23:21.934
- Mrs. Hayes! Mrs. Hayes!
- Yes, yes.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.170
I wouldn't want to bother you
but this is an emergency.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.306
- I don't want to bother you.
- Yes, I'm coming.

23:26.406 --> 23:29.108
Please, everything is destroyed.
It's a complete catastrophe.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.310
- House on fire?
- No, it's the pipe.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.713
- I don't know. Mrs. Hayes...
- Elsa.

23:33.813 --> 23:38.417
Please help me, I beg you.
Everyone's gone. The super's out.

23:38.517 --> 23:42.054
Laverne is in Pittsburgh. Now,
I don't know how this happened,

23:42.154 --> 23:45.024
but I was turning on the faucet
to get a glass of water, and look!

23:45.124 --> 23:47.324
This wouldn't stop!

23:49.928 --> 23:54.000
Turn off the water at the main pipe.
Where's your faucet?

23:54.100 --> 23:57.470
- I don't know.
- You don't know where your faucet is?

23:57.570 --> 24:02.233
Okay, I'm going to
find the faucet. Okay.

24:03.981 --> 24:06.839
Wait a minute. We got it.

24:10.450 --> 24:14.485
- Well, thank God that's over.
- You don't thank God. You thank me.

24:18.490 --> 24:21.845
- I'm bound to get pneumonia.
- No, you won't.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.127
Fred, help me.

24:24.227 --> 24:25.450
- No.
- Please, help me.

24:25.550 --> 24:27.800
I can't. My doctor told
me not to exert myself.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.703
- No, just help me up, dear.
- Oh, all right.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.757
Okay, one second. Let me
just walk. I can... I...

24:35.441 --> 24:36.810
Okay.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.602
Here we go.

24:42.041 --> 24:44.418
- "Help."
- What?

24:45.518 --> 24:47.518
I'm certain you got pneumonia.

25:07.939 --> 25:10.808
- Fred?
- Here.

25:14.679 --> 25:18.951
- Why are you always lying in bed like that?
- Why are you always on your feet?

25:19.051 --> 25:22.755
Where do you go? Why bother
running around in circles like that?

25:22.855 --> 25:26.425
It's pointless.
I'm tired, so I'm in bed.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.959
Okay.

25:29.862 --> 25:30.930
Good.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.432
Yes. I used to have
a restaurant, years ago.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.399
All right.

25:37.002 --> 25:40.894
- Is this cream dressing?
- No, it's very, very, healthy

25:40.994 --> 25:43.909
and nutritious and well-balanced.
I used to be a dietician.

25:44.980 --> 25:47.747
How many things have you been, exactly?

25:48.894 --> 25:52.885
Oh, Fred, you know, life is long,

25:52.985 --> 25:56.537
and when you've lived so many years,
and you do things,

25:56.637 --> 26:00.091
and you don't think when you're doing them,
they matter all that much, and then,

26:00.191 --> 26:04.230
one day you wake up and you
realize you managed quite a bit,

26:04.830 --> 26:06.866
and so much so you can't
even remember it all.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.869
Oh, I remember it all.
Home, work. Work, home.

26:11.283 --> 26:12.638
What's that?

26:13.238 --> 26:15.639
That was my first life.

26:16.941 --> 26:20.713
Over. I used to play classical guitar.
I had a career ahead of me.

26:20.813 --> 26:24.350
I was fixing up my first home.
I had an electric saw.

26:24.450 --> 26:28.066
You know, the do-it-yourself kind.
I slipped and...

26:29.106 --> 26:31.193
severed my tendon.

26:32.458 --> 26:36.393
Oh. Oh, Fred. I'm so sorry.

26:37.896 --> 26:40.633
The only thing that was important to me.

26:40.733 --> 26:45.471
Oh, that's a wonderful arpeggio.
Oh, come on. Now, play something for me.

26:45.571 --> 26:50.604
You know, I used to teach music, so,
I know a good hand when I see one.

26:50.704 --> 26:53.279
Leave it. Leave it.
That's only decoration.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.814
I just don't have the guts
to throw things away.

26:55.914 --> 27:00.197
Besides, I told you,
my technique is imperfect.

27:00.953 --> 27:04.656
Just wanted to have a little fun.
Make some music. A song.

27:04.756 --> 27:08.127
I don't care about technique.
I mean, so-so will do.

27:08.227 --> 27:12.865
Excuse me. I don't do anything so-so.

27:12.965 --> 27:17.236
I never have, until now.
Now I'm old, everything is so-so.

27:17.936 --> 27:21.373
I much prefer lying in
bed than to waste energy

27:21.573 --> 27:24.510
obtaining results that I know
will always be mediocre,

27:24.610 --> 27:27.680
and that goes for walking,
talking, thinking.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.416
Every day, worse.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

27:31.016 --> 27:34.918
thank you for dinner.
Thank you for your help.

27:37.021 --> 27:41.258
Just going to need a
little rest now. In peace.

27:44.862 --> 27:47.167
Only the dead rest in peace.

27:47.967 --> 27:51.303
Are you familiar with
the living dead? Good.

27:51.403 --> 27:54.740
I am that rare case of the dead living.

27:54.940 --> 27:58.275
I seem alive, but I'm already dead.

28:17.929 --> 28:20.930
They installed it without a washer.
That's why it exploded.

28:21.734 --> 28:26.272
Good job, Armande. You know,
what would we do without you?

28:27.072 --> 28:31.274
I'll leave it open, Mr. Barcroft.
You won't have to get up to let me in.

28:37.081 --> 28:38.315
Fred.

28:39.818 --> 28:41.177
Fred.

28:43.588 --> 28:44.588
Fred.

28:49.427 --> 28:52.195
Oh. I found the door open.

28:54.299 --> 28:57.636
I came for your memorial service,
but I see you're quite active.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.904
Oh, yeah. Peak activity
time around here.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.944
- Well, thank you.
- For what?

29:05.044 --> 29:08.147
For inviting me to sit down.
I can read your mind.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.913
Please sit down.

29:20.325 --> 29:24.196
- So, what's going on in the world?
- Well, nothing. It's all nonsense.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.164
Then why are you reading the newspaper?

29:26.264 --> 29:30.636
I read the obituaries.
I like to catch up on my friends.

29:30.836 --> 29:34.571
Oh, Fred... Why do you pretend
to be someone you're not?

29:36.341 --> 29:39.612
Look, this is who I am.

29:39.712 --> 29:42.114
It's you that sees something
in me, that isn't there.

29:42.214 --> 29:47.453
But it is there. You gave me the
most wonderful gift last night.

29:47.653 --> 29:50.522
Even a stone wouldn't have
been able to resist those stories

29:50.622 --> 29:54.660
- about hungry grandchildren and sick babies.
- No, that's not what I'm talking about,

29:54.760 --> 29:57.850
- although, that was an incredible gift.
- Thank you.

29:57.950 --> 30:01.634
No, I mean that you asked
for my help, Fred.

30:02.134 --> 30:06.123
And asking for help,
it's showing your weaknesses

30:06.223 --> 30:11.043
and your helplessness and
standing naked in front of others.

30:11.143 --> 30:14.712
You were naked in front of me, Fred.

30:17.115 --> 30:23.112
It's a special, precious thing,
letting someone help you. And you asked me.

30:24.089 --> 30:27.292
Fred, the path to life is long.

30:27.392 --> 30:31.964
Who said that, Gandhi?
Mother Teresa of Calcutta? Rocky Balboa?

30:32.064 --> 30:34.932
- No, I said it, Fred.
- I'm back.

30:36.601 --> 30:39.405
I got you a melon.
I went to the prostate counter,

30:39.505 --> 30:42.973
but they didn't have no
peanut-sized ones. Morning, ma'am.

30:46.052 --> 30:48.047
Now, listen...

30:48.447 --> 30:50.282
- Mrs. Hayes...
- Elsa.

30:50.382 --> 30:54.486
Whatever, Elsa. I asked you to
help me because I was drowning.

30:54.586 --> 30:57.790
I don't understand why you see
that as being so important.

30:58.090 --> 31:02.161
However, what does strike me
is that you say things to me

31:02.261 --> 31:06.931
that no one has ever said before.
Please, what do you want from me?

31:07.231 --> 31:10.903
I want everything between
us to be the first time.

31:11.403 --> 31:15.204
Fred, would you like me to
show you the path to life?

31:16.040 --> 31:18.177
If it makes you feel better.

31:18.777 --> 31:20.710
Well, it's baby steps.

31:21.979 --> 31:24.482
One step after the other.

31:24.831 --> 31:28.220
One, two, three.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.920
Baby steps.

31:46.871 --> 31:51.243
Excuse me, could I ask for some
information about dance lessons, please?

31:51.343 --> 31:52.976
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

31:54.779 --> 31:55.797
For you?

31:57.583 --> 31:59.106
Well, if not me, who?

32:00.486 --> 32:03.021
- Excuse me just one moment.
- Thank you.

32:08.325 --> 32:11.264
- Do we have an age limit?
- Not officially.

32:12.164 --> 32:15.836
We just don't like 'em croaking on the
dance floor. Tell her we're filled up.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.771
I'm sorry, ma'am,
we only accept couples.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.738
Couples?

32:23.774 --> 32:26.845
Well, she's single. And I'm single.

32:27.245 --> 32:32.251
No, no. That's discrimination.
And that's not okay. Want to know why?

32:32.751 --> 32:35.687
Well, when you have a little
rosebud mouth like yours,

32:35.787 --> 32:38.624
and it starts to turn wrinkly like this,

32:38.724 --> 32:41.560
and your little boobs... which are
not much to speak of, anyway...

32:41.660 --> 32:45.030
when they to start to fall like full,
ripe plums from the tree,

32:45.130 --> 32:49.444
well, that is when you understand
you're interested in dance lessons.

33:00.044 --> 33:01.313
Hello.

33:01.713 --> 33:06.049
- Is Fred home?
- He don't ever go no place.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.622
Nice.

33:12.568 --> 33:15.928
- Where?
- Oh, he's in his hidey-hole.

33:16.328 --> 33:20.499
H.T.C. Unveiled the butterfly "S"
at a press conference in Taiwan today.

33:20.599 --> 33:25.204
- The new flagship phone comes with a 5...
- What are you doing in front of the T.V.?

33:25.304 --> 33:27.139
- It's a beautiful day.
- Hey!

33:27.239 --> 33:30.175
And you have a beautiful
girl to take you out.

33:30.275 --> 33:32.344
I'm not beautiful, but I make it work.

33:32.444 --> 33:36.915
- I'm too tired. I'm too tired.
- Fred, you need to get some air.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.853
You're not going to start with that
"tired old man" routine in this house, too.

33:40.953 --> 33:44.489
- I changed my address, not my body.
- You need to change your head.

33:45.444 --> 33:46.678
I smell hamburger.

33:48.444 --> 33:50.729
- I don't.
- Well, that's because you're used to it.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.410
I mean, look at you.
You even look like Ronald McDonald.

33:54.599 --> 33:56.735
What's wrong with a colorful shirt?

33:56.835 --> 34:00.339
There are certain things at our age,
that just don't work.

34:00.439 --> 34:05.243
Trust me, I'm your doctor. The more you
stay in bed, the more tired you'll get.

34:05.343 --> 34:08.647
Go to the park. There's a beautiful
park right around the corner.

34:08.947 --> 34:11.648
Just mind your own business!
I'm just fine!

34:12.650 --> 34:15.654
Let me be tired when I want to be tired.

34:16.353 --> 34:18.021
Please.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.069
Laverne...

34:36.474 --> 34:38.475
I'm going out.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.210
Oh, Fred.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.427
Oh, come in. Step number one.

35:00.231 --> 35:02.485
Yes, that's me when I was young.

35:04.069 --> 35:08.140
Oh, yes, if you'd known me 50
years ago, you would believe it.

35:08.240 --> 35:13.011
We looked quite a bit alike.
And I had blonde hair, and platinum.

35:13.111 --> 35:17.449
Everyone mistook us for each other.
Of course, it drove my husband crazy.

35:17.549 --> 35:22.066
Sometimes now, when I now try to picture
his face, I can't, and... have a seat.

35:22.166 --> 35:23.880
- Thank you.
- I mean, 23 years

35:23.980 --> 35:27.526
- and I can't remember his face.
- 23? I thought you said it was 27.

35:28.253 --> 35:33.532
Oh, well, if you count the four years
before we were married, that makes 27.

35:33.632 --> 35:37.136
Sometimes, I say 23.
Sometimes, I say 27.

35:37.236 --> 35:38.504
- Sit down, Fred.
- Thank you.

35:38.604 --> 35:44.109
So, I see you were grabbed by Anita.
At the Trevi fountain in Rome.

35:44.209 --> 35:48.280
Who is this Anita? Is she a character
in the movie, or the actress?

35:48.480 --> 35:52.251
This is Anita Ekberg, the actress.
La dolce vita.

35:52.351 --> 35:55.621
Mastroianni, Fellini, you remember.

35:55.721 --> 35:58.223
Oh, I've heard of it, but I
don't remember seeing it.

35:58.323 --> 36:01.060
Well, it's the greatest
film of all time,

36:01.160 --> 36:05.794
and I have always dreamed of
going to the Trevi fountain, but Max...

36:05.894 --> 36:08.734
he'd never take me.
I tried to convince him,

36:08.834 --> 36:12.070
but there was always so much
more work going on, and...

36:12.170 --> 36:17.574
But my dream was, I would be Anita,
and he would be Marcello.

36:19.410 --> 36:22.247
But I suppose it was
not meant to happen.

36:23.347 --> 36:26.551
So, I suppose you
don't even know Picasso.

36:27.523 --> 36:30.322
- The dress designer?
- No, the artist.

36:30.422 --> 36:34.056
I know. It's just a
feeble attempt at humor.

36:34.559 --> 36:37.518
- He painted a wonderful portrait of me.
- No.

36:37.618 --> 36:42.934
Yes, he did. I was a young girl,
and he was very mature,

36:43.034 --> 36:46.904
but we had... we had a platonic,

36:47.004 --> 36:49.575
but passionate love.

36:49.775 --> 36:52.711
What do you mean by that,
exactly, if I may ask?

36:53.311 --> 36:56.948
Well, it means that there was a
really crazy attraction between us,

36:57.048 --> 37:00.886
although we never did anything. Nothing.

37:01.586 --> 37:05.657
And one day he grabbed this piece of paper,
and he painted my portrait,

37:05.757 --> 37:09.761
and he said... I remember it
like it was yesterday... he said,

37:11.073 --> 37:13.332
"this is better than intercourse"

37:13.932 --> 37:17.066
and I said, "Pablo, yes."

37:18.269 --> 37:22.341
- Still have it?
- Yes, of course. I have it in the safe.

37:22.441 --> 37:27.613
But, I couldn't tell you where the keys
are now. I'll get it. I'll get them.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.391
Well,

37:30.130 --> 37:33.647
you certainly have
had an extraordinary life.

37:34.747 --> 37:38.189
It's true. A beautiful woman
can have everything she wants.

37:38.289 --> 37:40.425
Well, Fred, let me remind you,
that's not me.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.928
Oh, I know that.
She doesn't look like you.

37:43.028 --> 37:45.597
Well, I have pictures of myself,
if you don't believe me.

37:45.697 --> 37:48.296
I believe you. I believe you.
You're just different, that's all.

37:51.069 --> 37:54.371
So, Fred, tell me, what...
what have you gotten out of life?

37:56.208 --> 37:59.912
Oh, 40 years of telecommunications,
a bum marriage,

38:00.012 --> 38:03.348
a ball-breaking daughter,
who I'm fond of, occasionally,

38:03.848 --> 38:07.486
one or two friends,
and that's my 80 years.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.677
You're 80?

38:09.931 --> 38:13.592
- You're... you're older than me.
- Really?

38:13.692 --> 38:17.028
Well, that sentence
didn't come out right.

38:17.128 --> 38:21.682
I'm 74. You're with a
younger woman. Yeah.

38:23.001 --> 38:28.538
Tell me, with all your 80 years being
on this earth, how much did you laugh?

38:32.343 --> 38:33.977
Very little.

38:37.481 --> 38:42.819
Well, stick with me, Fred, and...
have a drink and try the pastries.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.593
Why don't you play me something?

38:53.364 --> 38:54.357
Well...

38:58.637 --> 39:03.241
No, I asked you first. You play something
for me, then I'll play something for you.

39:03.741 --> 39:05.750
You're going to have
to wait a long time.

39:07.045 --> 39:10.684
Remember, baby steps.
You're ready for the second?

39:13.218 --> 39:15.186
Oh, it's so beautiful!

39:15.286 --> 39:18.323
Well, I don't see anything
out of the ordinary.

39:18.923 --> 39:21.626
Children regurgitating their food.

39:21.726 --> 39:26.431
Old people sitting around on benches,
waiting to pop their clogs.

39:26.731 --> 39:31.770
Oh, come on. Tell me, did you and
your wife really hate each other?

39:31.870 --> 39:35.907
Well, she was a good woman.
We had our misunderstandings.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.509
And that's it?

39:37.609 --> 39:41.446
Yeah, she was a good organizer.
She organized everything.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.382
Were you happy?

39:43.782 --> 39:47.352
I don't know. I never asked myself.

39:47.652 --> 39:49.754
Well, you know, we were just normal,

39:49.854 --> 39:52.324
- like other people.
- Unhappy.

39:52.424 --> 39:57.528
I'm sorry, do you think we could change
the subject? I don't like talking about it.

39:57.628 --> 40:00.431
- Okay.
- In fact, I'd like to go home.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.901
Oh, right. You're tired.

40:03.001 --> 40:06.037
No, I don't like parks.

40:06.471 --> 40:08.807
They make me feel I'm
already in the cemetery.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.443
I never took my daughter
when she was a kid.

40:11.543 --> 40:16.047
- I never took a dog when I had a dog.
- Fine. We'll go back.

40:16.147 --> 40:19.916
Come, come.
Why are you so grumpy?

40:31.461 --> 40:35.233
Excuse me? I need some flowers here.
Will you give me a hand?

40:35.333 --> 40:38.837
- Sure. Are they for a lady?
- Yeah.

40:39.137 --> 40:43.241
- Perhaps she'd like some roses.
- I've no idea.

40:43.341 --> 40:46.811
Oh. This is your first
time bringing her flowers?

40:46.911 --> 40:50.179
- Yeah. This...
- Oh, those are lovely.

41:07.198 --> 41:10.101
Yeah, I knew you'd be pissed.

41:10.969 --> 41:15.276
Since it's been eight months and
I haven't come to see you once.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.810
The more you got pissed,
the more I didn't come.

41:18.910 --> 41:22.914
Anyway, I never leave the house.
Ask around.

41:23.014 --> 41:27.353
I don't even go see anyone.
Not even live people.

41:27.953 --> 41:29.537
Listen...

41:30.155 --> 41:32.342
I wanted to ask you something.

41:33.425 --> 41:35.455
Were we happy?

41:37.962 --> 41:40.200
No. I know.

41:41.032 --> 41:43.199
Just wanted to make sure.

41:56.581 --> 41:59.084
You have got a show.

41:59.284 --> 42:02.985
- Where did you get this?
- Don't ask. And not a word to your brother.

42:07.057 --> 42:09.494
Oh, no floral shirt today.

42:09.894 --> 42:12.697
- It was striped.
- Yeah, same difference.

42:12.797 --> 42:17.035
You're right. It's the same.
At this point, nothing makes a difference.

42:17.135 --> 42:21.639
I'm resigned to the fact
that we no longer have a...

42:21.739 --> 42:27.378
value in this life. It's time to
wave the white flag, old friend.

42:27.478 --> 42:30.282
You know, you could use
a caregiver. Laverne.

42:30.782 --> 42:34.986
She has very little left here to do.
And I feel bad. She needs the work.

42:35.086 --> 42:39.491
Oh, keep her close, Fred.
You'll need her. Oh, you'll need her.

42:39.591 --> 42:42.618
Why are you so negative?
What's a matter with you?

42:43.294 --> 42:45.597
I stupidly fell in love.

42:45.697 --> 42:48.730
Oh, I am so sorry. Who's the woman?

42:54.505 --> 42:56.241
Impossible.

42:56.341 --> 42:59.575
- Well, of course it's impossible.
- Give me that.

43:00.844 --> 43:04.816
Old women are old,
young girls are young,

43:04.916 --> 43:07.986
and we... we're just trash.

43:08.086 --> 43:12.022
Trash, yeah. Just like your coffee.

43:15.859 --> 43:20.665
Fred, are you ready for step number three?
I'm sorry. You have company.

43:20.765 --> 43:24.068
Oh, this is my friend, John.
Elsa, my neighbor.

43:24.768 --> 43:26.971
- I was just leaving.
- Oh, you don't have to.

43:27.071 --> 43:29.140
No, step number three can wait.

43:29.909 --> 43:33.011
John. It's a real pleasure to meet you.

43:33.111 --> 43:37.002
- Pleasure's mine.
- I know. Have a nice night.

43:43.187 --> 43:44.923
You old dog!

43:45.023 --> 43:48.159
What's all this about a third step?

43:48.259 --> 43:52.230
- Oh, it's nothing. It's just a game.
- A game? How cute. What sort of game?

43:52.330 --> 43:54.899
Well, there's nothing to tell, really.

43:55.985 --> 43:58.570
Actually, it's a long story.

43:58.770 --> 44:01.906
I lent her some money and
she wanted to thank me.

44:02.073 --> 44:06.578
The fact that even you have a love life,
gives me hope for my future.

44:06.678 --> 44:09.514
Love life? Are you crazy?

44:09.614 --> 44:14.419
And what do you mean by "even you"?
Why can't I have a love life?

44:14.519 --> 44:16.921
See? Congratulations.

44:17.021 --> 44:19.857
- She seems a considerable woman.
- Well, why don't you consider her then?

44:19.957 --> 44:21.426
- Go ahead.
- I might just do that.

44:21.526 --> 44:23.461
I wouldn't recommend it.
She's a woman with issues.

44:23.561 --> 44:25.897
All women have issues.
What kind of issues?

44:25.997 --> 44:31.035
She supports her widowed,
unemployed son with five children,

44:31.135 --> 44:35.507
she's a little unhinged. But go ahead,
you'll see for yourself.

44:35.607 --> 44:40.676
You're jealous. I've never seen
you like this, in all these years.

44:45.883 --> 44:49.488
So I'm supposed to trust you. Blindly.

44:49.988 --> 44:53.692
Where are you taking me?
What is this third step?

44:53.992 --> 44:56.258
Do you trust me or not?

45:00.397 --> 45:04.349
You don't have to do a thing. I will
take care of everything. It's all right.

45:04.449 --> 45:07.472
Hello! So, I'm not single anymore.

45:07.572 --> 45:10.440
We're here to try out first a lesson.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.778
- You have to sign this.
- Thank you.

45:16.814 --> 45:18.306
Now, Fred...

45:19.117 --> 45:22.253
Sign it? Are you completely insane?

45:22.353 --> 45:24.355
- I'm not doing that.
- No, look... look...

45:24.455 --> 45:25.757
No, no. I'm not going in there.

45:25.857 --> 45:29.560
No, look, Fred.
It's wonderful. Give it a chance.

45:29.660 --> 45:31.062
- If you don't like it...
- You're out of your mind, woman.

45:31.162 --> 45:32.897
Fred, you don't have
to learn this dance.

45:32.997 --> 45:37.302
There's so many that you would enjoy doing.
If you don't like it, then we can leave.

45:37.402 --> 45:41.837
Elsa, good-bye. I don't want to
have anything to do with you.

45:55.886 --> 45:57.587
Oh, God.

46:00.324 --> 46:03.428
- Why are old people always so pissed off?
- I don't know. Who's pissed off?

46:03.528 --> 46:06.712
- Other than you?
- I'm not.

46:07.332 --> 46:10.329
No. Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'm pissed off.

46:10.902 --> 46:13.805
- And then there's Mom and Dad, too.
- And why are they pissed off?

46:13.905 --> 46:17.208
Well, Dad, because he doesn't have the money
for the remote-controlled glasses store.

46:17.308 --> 46:19.177
- And Mom?
- Well, Mom...

46:19.277 --> 46:21.446
Mom is pissed off at everything.

46:21.546 --> 46:25.283
She yells all the time.
Sometimes, I want to strangle her.

46:25.383 --> 46:29.187
Yeah, well, you can't now.
You've got to wait to get your revenge

46:29.287 --> 46:33.024
when she's old.
She's doing that to me now.

46:33.724 --> 46:35.593
Why does she want revenge?

46:35.693 --> 46:39.664
Well, I don't know if I was a good dad.
I don't think I was.

46:39.764 --> 46:41.912
Well, you're a good grandpa though.

46:52.642 --> 46:54.245
Armande...

46:54.745 --> 46:58.083
- What have you gone and done?
- I fell off a ladder.

46:58.983 --> 47:03.621
- Armande! What the hell?
- I know. It's, like, two months like this.

47:03.721 --> 47:05.923
Who's going to help me?
I've got to find somebody.

47:06.023 --> 47:07.690
Oh, I've got an idea.

47:11.795 --> 47:13.631
- You looking at me?
- Yeah.

47:14.631 --> 47:17.631
- What's Lydia going to say?
- Do we care?

47:34.327 --> 47:35.553
Now, you go on, dear.

47:35.653 --> 47:39.429
- No, mother...
- No, I'll catch a cab. It's fine.

47:42.894 --> 47:44.527
Excuse me.

47:44.901 --> 47:47.759
Hi, Elsa. Thank you, Will.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.403
Are we doing our homework, Elsa?

47:58.075 --> 47:59.477
Doing our homework.

48:00.835 --> 48:03.315
But Wednesday night,
I forgot to take my green pill.

48:04.515 --> 48:08.548
- And why is that?
- I was busy doing other things.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.956
It's just the beginning, but I think...

48:12.056 --> 48:14.792
- Well, maybe it's friendship.
- You think?

48:14.892 --> 48:19.582
But I never did understand when
friendship ends and love begins.

48:20.164 --> 48:24.643
But, in my opinion, if it's love...

48:25.703 --> 48:28.907
It's so much so swift!

48:29.007 --> 48:32.410
And then you... and then you
tell yourself it's friendship.

48:32.610 --> 48:34.645
You know what? I'll keep that in mind.

48:34.745 --> 48:37.482
Oh, well, you have plenty
of time to screw it up.

48:38.482 --> 48:40.451
You know, I, on the other hand...

48:42.444 --> 48:45.423
- You're not that sick, Elsa.
- Oh, no, don't lie to me, doctor.

48:45.523 --> 48:47.440
I saw the test results.

48:48.659 --> 48:52.163
I could hardly make it
over here, by myself.

49:34.137 --> 49:35.890
Marcello...

49:37.223 --> 49:39.007
Marcello...

49:42.379 --> 49:44.613
Marcello, come here.

50:02.899 --> 50:06.504
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I got carried away.

50:06.604 --> 50:10.108
I should never have taken
you to that dance school.

50:10.208 --> 50:14.194
I just didn't respect your pace. But...

50:15.913 --> 50:20.151
to show you I'm sorry, I'd like to invite
you to the finest restaurant in town.

50:20.551 --> 50:22.486
I have no intention of accepting.

50:22.686 --> 50:25.656
Oh, you're still mad. All right.

50:25.756 --> 50:29.093
Then, let me see,
I'll say I'm sorry again,

50:29.193 --> 50:34.132
and we'll turn back time,
and we'll go back to step two.

50:34.232 --> 50:36.367
I don't need you to
teach me how to walk.

50:36.467 --> 50:40.471
You made me look ridiculous at that
place in front of all those mad cretins.

50:40.671 --> 50:44.709
Fred, you left me there.
You left me standing there like a fool.

50:45.117 --> 50:47.879
- You really offended me.
- Oh, you're angry and offended?

50:47.979 --> 50:50.414
I was just trying to help
you do something new.

50:50.514 --> 50:53.317
- Thank you for helping the poor imbecile.
- No, you asked me for help.

50:53.417 --> 50:58.625
I would have asked anyone with a pair
of hands to come and turn off a tap,

50:58.725 --> 51:03.037
which some moron had hidden in
the most obscure place possible!

51:03.737 --> 51:07.683
Anybody? Anyone? Fred, I...

51:09.267 --> 51:11.485
I cared about you from the first minute.

51:11.585 --> 51:14.772
And I am really sorry
that you don't see that.

51:17.061 --> 51:19.877
Elsa? Elsa?

51:20.387 --> 51:22.111
Don't let's fight anymore.

51:23.248 --> 51:26.299
It's all I've ever done my whole life.

51:27.318 --> 51:31.088
I'm sorry. I'm just a crazy old man.

51:31.891 --> 51:34.292
I guess we're just two old fools.

51:34.992 --> 51:36.492
You can say that again.

51:43.533 --> 51:47.636
You go get dressed now and
I'll forget this ever happened.

51:52.041 --> 51:54.469
How did you put up with him?

51:55.179 --> 51:58.295
He's a very difficult man.

51:59.317 --> 52:01.883
You have to take him with a...

52:07.557 --> 52:12.039
Elsa? What are we? Me and you?

52:12.730 --> 52:14.932
Ever since I met you...

52:15.032 --> 52:19.403
my life is different. It's strange.

52:19.503 --> 52:22.871
- Is it good strange or bad strange?
- Strange.

52:25.075 --> 52:28.402
Fred, I don't want to get hurt.

52:28.946 --> 52:32.383
And I've told you how I care about you.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.962
I'm just wondering if
it's more than that.

52:35.862 --> 52:38.289
I have such strong feelings.

52:39.017 --> 52:41.526
- You sound like a teenager.
- I am a teenager.

52:41.626 --> 52:44.929
Yes, you are.
A girl in the body of a woman.

52:45.029 --> 52:47.129
- Yeah.
- A very beautiful woman.

52:50.067 --> 52:53.001
- So it's good strange.
- Oh, yes.

52:55.972 --> 52:58.907
Do you think we have a future together?

53:01.377 --> 53:03.230
Are you blushing?

53:03.614 --> 53:08.288
I love this 80-year-old man
sitting across from me, blushing.

53:11.222 --> 53:14.089
How could I not fall in love with you?

53:16.459 --> 53:18.245
Thank you.

53:18.529 --> 53:20.498
Would you like some coffee?
Cappuccino, perhaps?

53:20.598 --> 53:23.265
- No. Just the check, please.
- Right away.

53:27.554 --> 53:30.875
- What is it?
- My glycemia.

53:31.075 --> 53:33.244
Do you have any idea what
it's like to be really sick?

53:33.344 --> 53:37.615
Put your finger in it and enjoy it.
Do you know what Pablo said to me?

53:37.715 --> 53:39.684
- Pablo who?
- Picasso, you know.

53:39.784 --> 53:44.922
He said, "what you should do is mock death,
and then she will be afraid of you."

53:45.222 --> 53:49.592
You're not afraid of death.
Fred, you're afraid of life. Finger.

53:57.601 --> 53:59.117
Whenever you're ready.

53:59.503 --> 54:03.455
- Well, to life.
- To life, Fred.

54:04.775 --> 54:08.579
My God. They're robbing us blind.

54:08.679 --> 54:13.050
Let me see it, Fred. I invited you
to dinner, so don't you worry.

54:13.150 --> 54:16.487
- Enough money?
- They're robbing us blind.

54:16.587 --> 54:19.223
Fred, this is what we're going to do.

54:19.323 --> 54:22.793
On the count of three, we're going
to get up and we're going to leave.

54:22.893 --> 54:24.495
- Are you mad?
- No, not at all.

54:24.595 --> 54:28.166
Because they will never notice
two innocuous old people like us.

54:28.266 --> 54:30.387
Ready? One... two..

54:30.487 --> 54:32.634
- Elsa!
- Three! Go!

54:47.884 --> 54:50.388
Have you seen the old couple
that were sitting at table five?

54:50.488 --> 54:54.885
- Yes, they just left.
- They just... Oh, my God.

54:56.674 --> 54:59.697
- Come on, Fred! Get in here!
- This is insane. I'm not doing this.

54:59.797 --> 55:03.701
We are not paying $400 for
a dinner, Fred. Now, get in the car.

55:03.801 --> 55:06.367
- Get in now!
- Elsa, this is not good for my health.

55:13.010 --> 55:16.262
- Are we being followed, Fred?
- I don't know.

55:16.814 --> 55:21.049
Everything is fine. Don't worry.
Did you really think we'd end up in prison?

55:23.187 --> 55:26.190
- It stalled. This happens sometimes.
- What's the matter now?

55:26.974 --> 55:28.557
Okay.

55:32.962 --> 55:34.498
They missed us.

55:34.598 --> 55:38.569
Oh, you're out of your mind, woman.
First step, second step, six steps.

55:38.669 --> 55:42.172
I do all I can to keep up with you,
and you're totally off your rocker!

55:42.272 --> 55:47.044
- Oh, Fred, come on. Everything is fine.
- Yeah, but why didn't you just pay?

55:47.144 --> 55:50.047
Because it was a beautiful evening.

55:50.147 --> 55:53.617
It was priceless, and when something
is priceless, what is there to pay?

55:53.717 --> 55:56.587
Oh, my God. I don't feel good.

55:56.687 --> 56:00.157
- What?
- Oh, no. Elsa, I can't breathe.

56:00.257 --> 56:02.426
My left... my left arm hurts.

56:02.526 --> 56:03.928
- Fred, come on, please.
- Get me to a hospital.

56:04.028 --> 56:06.430
- You're all right.
- No, get me to a hospital! Please!

56:06.530 --> 56:08.799
- Please let's not fight.
- I know I'm going to have a stroke.

56:08.899 --> 56:10.468
- I just know it.
- Oh, of course. Okay.

56:10.568 --> 56:14.736
I'm going to spend the rest of my life
drooling in a wheelchair. Oh, God.

56:17.975 --> 56:22.546
I've reviewed all your tests.
Everything looks normal.

56:23.146 --> 56:27.718
Tell me did you... have anything to
drink tonight or eat any rich foods?

56:27.818 --> 56:32.687
- Experience any strong emotions?
- All of the above, and under two hours.

56:33.424 --> 56:36.494
Well, I'm going to give you
something to help you relax.

56:36.594 --> 56:39.094
Go home and go straight to bed.

56:42.131 --> 56:44.608
- He will.
- If this lady will let me.

56:45.936 --> 56:48.906
Ma'am, your husband's just a
little stressed. He needs to rest.

56:49.006 --> 56:51.208
My husband? Oh, yes. He is...

56:51.308 --> 56:54.864
We've... marriage is such a long thing.

56:54.964 --> 57:00.249
He is so boring that I have
to shake him up every...

57:02.820 --> 57:05.556
The wives... they're insufferable
from the start!

57:05.656 --> 57:07.089
- Here you go.
- Pills. Thank you.

57:11.628 --> 57:15.731
How adorable. Even after all these years,
they still want to fight and make up.

57:34.617 --> 57:38.188
Well, this is where I found you,
and this is where I...

57:38.288 --> 57:40.188
I will be leaving.

57:47.130 --> 57:50.426
- How's the old ticker?
- Oh, it's better.

58:01.244 --> 58:04.906
If you wait two more seconds,
I'm going to go.

58:21.030 --> 58:26.932
It is too soon for me to ask
if I could sleep here tonight?

58:27.738 --> 58:29.420
To sleep?

58:30.240 --> 58:32.263
What step's that?

58:33.143 --> 58:35.144
I've lost count.

58:54.931 --> 58:56.967
Good morning.

58:57.167 --> 58:59.704
Yup, it's morning.

58:59.970 --> 59:02.270
It's not a so-so date.

59:04.308 --> 59:08.483
- You play sublimely.
- No. So-so.

59:09.613 --> 59:11.659
Sublimely.

59:19.288 --> 59:21.757
Hello, armande. How's your arm?

59:23.026 --> 59:24.493
It's...

59:33.302 --> 59:34.949
Dad? Dad?

59:39.308 --> 59:41.224
Dad?

59:47.151 --> 59:49.042
Dad?

59:58.495 --> 01:00:01.932
- Dad? What are you doing?
- Taking a bath.

01:00:03.332 --> 01:00:06.534
- Are you okay?
- What's it look like?

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:12.409
I've just never seen you
take a bath at this hour.

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:17.809
Ooh, stop the press. Hold the frontpage.
"Man taking bath in afternoon."

01:00:17.909 --> 01:00:19.444
And...

01:00:20.851 --> 01:00:22.918
- What's this?
- A pair of shoes.

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.416
Is it Laverne's?

01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:32.185
Oh, I bet it's that woman
who lives across the hall!

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:35.599
Dad... what are you doing?

01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:38.001
I'm doing what I should
have done years ago.

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:41.472
Now, would you mind leaving me
and closing the door behind you?

01:00:41.572 --> 01:00:44.631
- Does John know?
- It's my life, Lydia!

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:47.644
If I want to stop taking pills,
I'll stop taking pills.

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:50.414
If I want to have a bath in the afternoon,
I'll take a bath in the...

01:00:50.514 --> 01:00:53.584
Oh, and while we're on the subject,
I've found Laverne a new job.

01:00:53.684 --> 01:00:56.321
If you want, go down to the lobby.
She'll explain everything.

01:00:57.221 --> 01:01:00.658
But why... but why, Dad?

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:02.826
You're acting like a baby.

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:06.829
I'll take that as a compliment.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:10.933
Door!

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:18.375
<i>Got a snap in my fingers
Snap my fingers</i>

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:20.711
<i>Got a rhythm in my walk
Rhythm in my walk</i>

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:24.771
<i>As the elephants say
Living in a great big way</i>

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:30.581
On this CD, every song is this song.
Alec made it for me.

01:01:30.888 --> 01:01:34.886
I love it. It's so stimulating.
It's like pouring caffeine into your ears.

01:01:34.986 --> 01:01:36.466
You're crazy.

01:01:36.866 --> 01:01:40.898
- You're a crazy, insane, beautiful woman.
- I know.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.502
<i>Keep a snap in my fingers</i>

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:16.400
Yeah, we're going to need more tomatoes.

01:02:17.095 --> 01:02:19.567
We'd better write it on the...
write it down on the board.

01:02:45.494 --> 01:02:49.332
These canvasses represent my
dreams of the last few years,

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:52.302
and I'd like to share them with you.

01:02:52.402 --> 01:02:57.052
I'd like to open the show with my
favorite creation... "Explosion... "

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:00.177
She's here.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:04.512
Sorry we're late.
My car was in the shop.

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:09.418
"Explosion of pain."

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:21.350
Enjoy.

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:30.040
- This is my boyfriend, Fred.
- Oh, hello.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:34.111
This is my eldest, Raymond.
And his wife, Laura.

01:03:34.211 --> 01:03:35.946
- Oh, Laura.
- Hi.

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:40.309
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:45.923
Remember when he was small
and he would do those drawings?

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:49.092
I found them absolutely enchanting.

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:52.891
And you, on the other hand,
you liked arithmetic.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:55.791
Fred?

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:59.569
- Fred, I've heard a lot about you.
- Yes, this is him.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:03.625
- So what do you think?
- Oh, it's very...

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:09.146
intense. I have to tell you
that I admire your dedication

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:11.481
as a man as much as an artist.

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:15.185
All alone with five kids.
That's got to be very difficult.

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:18.488
I don't have any children, Fred.
Raymond is the family man,

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:21.059
but he's only got one.
A daughter.

01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:26.094
Oh, that must be poor little April.

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.411
Fred?

01:04:37.074 --> 01:04:40.210
I just can't believe you!
You embellished everything.

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:42.779
That story about those
children was heartbreaking!

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:47.751
But, Fred, if a story has to be sad,
it has to be really, really sad.

01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:51.288
I couldn't settle for a so-so sad story.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.957
You know, it excited my imagination.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:58.828
Hey, grandma! Hey, gramps!
Why don't you two go tuck yourselves in?

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:01.965
You keep out of this, sonny boy!

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:06.670
Now, look, why... why didn't
you just tell me the truth?

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:09.206
Were you afraid that I was going
to ask for the money back?

01:05:09.306 --> 01:05:10.841
I'll give it all back to you.

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:13.276
Yeah, well, the money was
for Alec's show, wasn't it?

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:16.847
But what is the problem with
a few things not adding up?

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:22.052
If you told me tomorrow that Lydia was
not your daughter, I wouldn't care.

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:25.422
All right, all right. Okay, okay.
Let's forget the whole thing and start over.

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:27.557
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:29.192
What else have you told
me that wasn't true?

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:30.727
- Nothing.
- Oh, you sure?

01:05:30.827 --> 01:05:35.655
Yes. Positive. A hundred
percent sure. This is my Fred.

01:05:35.755 --> 01:05:37.868
- This is how I like you.
- Well...

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.315
Why didn't you tell me about Fred?

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.146
Do you like him? He's handsome?

01:05:46.246 --> 01:05:50.703
Well, what's going on? I mean...
What purpose does it serve at this point?

01:05:51.214 --> 01:05:53.917
Are you trying to tell
me that I'm too old?

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:58.188
No, I'm... I'm trying to tell you
you're being irresponsible.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:03.434
Oh, that's odd, coming from somebody
who's been married three times.

01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:07.431
The purpose is...

01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:10.301
we make each other so happy.

01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:13.372
Does he know you're sick?

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:20.694
No. And it's your head if you tell him.

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:26.593
Okay. Now, tell me I'm beautiful.

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:29.119
You're beautiful.

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:30.919
Almost.

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:36.293
Is the car right outside the front door?

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:39.427
Why? Why are you so
nervous all of a sudden?

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:46.301
- So what are you drawing there?
- Just drawing a little heart.

01:06:50.107 --> 01:06:54.220
- Oh, you're all dolled up.
- My daughter's birthday.

01:06:55.045 --> 01:06:56.847
- Mom...
- Hi, Fred.

01:06:56.947 --> 01:06:58.849
He's your boyfriend.
Why don't you invite him?

01:06:58.949 --> 01:07:01.685
Oh, he wouldn't be
interested in this, honey.

01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:05.590
Children screaming all over the
place and junk food and balloons

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:08.625
and vomit everywhere. No, no, no.
You've got better things to do.

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:13.163
- Well, actually, I don't.
- Well, good then. It's settled. Come on.

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:15.563
All right. Thanks.

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:28.779
- Are you upset that I came?
- No. Not at all.

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:31.681
- Oh. You sure?
- I'm positive.

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:35.517
- You're looking kind of strange.
- Well, I am strange.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.962
Oh, Alec!

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:42.359
- Oh, good to see you again, sir.
- Good to see you.

01:07:42.459 --> 01:07:45.629
- Is this your gift to her?
- "Country morning."

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:48.832
Seemed like the most appropriate
painting for a girl of her age.

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:52.335
How is this appropriate
for her age, Alec?

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:55.159
- Is that a dead duck?
- Yes.

01:07:55.259 --> 01:07:58.476
Yes, it is. It'll be worth
crazy money in a few years,

01:07:58.576 --> 01:08:00.908
and she could sell it and buy
all the weed she can smoke.

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:06.650
Okay, come on, everyone. Let's...
Let's do the photograph now. Fred? Yeah.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.916
Mom, come on. Come on. Come on.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:12.422
- Is your father coming?
- At this point, I doubt it.

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:14.257
- That's good.
- Why?

01:08:14.357 --> 01:08:18.127
- Because I told Fred I was a widow.
- Mom! Why?

01:08:18.228 --> 01:08:22.250
I don't know. It just slipped out. Yeah.

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:26.285
All right. Everybody smile real big!

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:28.205
- Ready? Here we go.
- Yeah.

01:08:28.305 --> 01:08:30.406
- Big smiles.
- Yes. Very good.

01:08:31.174 --> 01:08:32.977
No, no. Wait!

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.880
Grandpa has arrived.

01:08:37.493 --> 01:08:39.819
Gramps! Grandpa!

01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:44.868
Son of a bitch. He showed.

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:50.058
- Is that your wife's father?
- No, it's my father.

01:08:53.328 --> 01:08:56.899
Yay! Grandpa! Come on, Grandpa!
Come get in the photo!

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.371
All right, everybody.
Real big now! Ready?

01:09:01.071 --> 01:09:03.430
Squeeze together a little bit more.
Big smiles now.

01:09:05.041 --> 01:09:08.979
- You like doing this to me, don't you?
- I didn't do anything to you, Fred.

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:12.149
If I did anything to anybody,
it was to my ex-husband.

01:09:12.249 --> 01:09:15.785
- I killed him and with good reason.
- Oh, yeah? And what was that?

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:19.022
- 'cause he let me down.
- I hope I never let you down.

01:09:19.122 --> 01:09:23.292
Oh, Fred. He was so unfaithful.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.563
When I found out having an affair...

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:30.000
I confronted him and
he denied it obviously.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:35.438
So I needed to follow him and
catch him in the act, so to speak.

01:09:35.537 --> 01:09:37.372
Did you draw him out?

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:40.678
No, I went to London
with some girlfriends.

01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:42.946
And we went to a male strip club.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:47.283
After the show, one of the boys
came back. Oh, he was beautiful.

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:51.488
He was very tall and dark and handsome.
He had blue eyes. His name was Steve.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:56.493
And he looked into my face,
and I said, "How much?"

01:09:56.793 --> 01:09:59.696
And he came to my room
and he was so affectionate.

01:09:59.796 --> 01:10:02.465
And he was... he was hot.

01:10:03.647 --> 01:10:07.771
When I got back, I told Max everything.

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:11.141
And he got so angry,
and I said, "Why are you angry?

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:13.943
You can do this sort
of thing and I can't?"

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:17.447
And he said, "Yes, because I'm a man."

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:22.218
Well, I did it. I buried him right there.
So now you know why I killed him.

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:24.669
Everything you say to me...

01:10:24.869 --> 01:10:29.160
seems like such a lie.
The stripper, Picasso,

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:32.429
- the portrait.
- Oh, I can get the portrait by Picasso.

01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:35.065
- It's in my safe.
- Come on, let's see it.

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:41.630
No. If we're going to trust each other,
you have to trust me without proof.

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:48.853
Elsa... I wish I could trust you.

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:53.581
And I don't believe you.

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:55.956
Period!

01:10:56.519 --> 01:10:58.151
Fred.

01:10:58.455 --> 01:10:59.723
- Fred!
- You're a liar, Elsa!

01:10:59.823 --> 01:11:02.126
- Fred, where are you going?
- A shameless liar.

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:04.628
Oh, Lydia.

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:07.395
If your car gets smacked, it wasn't me.

01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:12.600
- Dad, where are you going?
- For a walk! In the fucking park!

01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:15.260
Dad.

01:11:16.345 --> 01:11:19.642
Hold on, Dad. Okay, what is going on?

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:23.847
I mean, Mom is barely cold in the grave,
and you're seeing that woman?

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:26.950
- Would you mind your own business?
- This is my business.

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:29.587
She is not good for you.
Look at you. You're all red.

01:11:29.687 --> 01:11:32.055
- So I'm red. So what?
- Well, at your age...

01:11:32.155 --> 01:11:35.792
Oh, at my age, I can't be red?
What would you prefer? Green? Blue?

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:38.728
Just stop sticking your
nose into my business!

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:40.487
And give me back the copy of your keys.

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:44.022
- But... what if there's an emergency?
- Give them back to me!

01:11:44.122 --> 01:11:46.169
I'll call the super.

01:11:46.369 --> 01:11:48.336
Good-bye, Lydia!

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:54.858
Why did you come?

01:11:56.278 --> 01:12:00.550
Because, on Thursday... we have to
sign the contract for the warehouse.

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.986
I have to order all of the
"can't lose" glasses,

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:06.723
and I wanted to know if you'd decided.

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:07.944
Well, I have.

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:11.528
- And?
- I'll do it.

01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:13.643
Really?

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:17.667
Stop by before signing. We'll go
to the bank and write the check.

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:19.236
Okay. Thank you.

01:12:19.636 --> 01:12:20.902
- Thanks.
- Good-bye, Lydia.

01:12:28.278 --> 01:12:30.046
Oh, God!

01:12:30.146 --> 01:12:33.781
Lydia, what do you want now?

01:12:37.885 --> 01:12:39.374
- Good evening.
- Oh, good evening.

01:12:39.474 --> 01:12:42.515
Well, you would show up
completely unexpected,

01:12:42.615 --> 01:12:45.000
tonight of all nights! What do you want?

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:48.097
- We need to talk.
- About what?

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.498
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:58.408
- May I sit down?
- Yeah, of course. Of course.

01:12:58.508 --> 01:13:01.878
Now, look, I don't know
if you are her husband,

01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:05.783
- her ex-husband, her dead husband...
- She told you I was dead?

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:08.351
I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

01:13:08.451 --> 01:13:11.154
- Frederick Barcroft.
- Max. Maxwell Hayes.

01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:13.690
Look, Fred, Elsa, my wife...

01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:16.859
- she's very dangerous.
- You're still married?

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:20.330
Well, technically. It means nothing.
It was long ago.

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:23.433
But she confuses reality
with her imagination.

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:27.737
She lies, and then she believes
her own lies, as if they were true.

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:30.573
- I loved her with all my heart.
- Yeah, but you cheated on her.

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:33.454
- After she cheated on me.
- No, that's not true!

01:13:33.554 --> 01:13:36.446
Oh, she's got you believing that. Well,
that's what's so dangerous about her.

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:40.283
See, she transforms her
fantasies into something real.

01:13:40.483 --> 01:13:43.453
When she cheated on me,
I caught her red-handed.

01:13:43.553 --> 01:13:47.457
You mean that you went all the way
to London to catch her in the act?

01:13:47.557 --> 01:13:51.325
She's never been to London!
It was here, in New Orleans.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:54.320
I need a drink.

01:13:56.122 --> 01:13:58.468
- You want anything?
- No, nothing for me.

01:13:58.568 --> 01:14:02.105
I don't drink, hardly.
Well, she said I was a drunk.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:05.141
That's one thing she threw in my face.
You know, one thing's for sure.

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:10.246
She'll drive you to insanity.
She lives in this dream world.

01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:13.294
- Did she talk to you about the actress?
- Who? Who?

01:14:13.394 --> 01:14:16.773
- The blonde with the big... you know...
- Oh. Anita Ekberg.

01:14:16.873 --> 01:14:19.944
Yeah, her. Did she tell you about her...

01:14:20.044 --> 01:14:22.793
her dream of going to Rome?
To the fountain?

01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:25.828
Yeah, yeah. But she told me that
you didn't want to take her there.

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:30.302
But she wanted to get into the fountain,
for crying out loud! And dress up like...

01:14:30.402 --> 01:14:35.405
What's-her-name? And I had to dress
up like that other guy in the movie.

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:40.141
It was madness. And for what?
What? To get arrested?

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:45.114
I just came here today to warn you.

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:47.214
One second, Max.

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:51.120
Is it true?

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.549
That when she was young, she...
she looked like Anita Ekberg?

01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:58.882
No, that's a lie.

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:02.498
She was even more beautiful.
She was fantastic.

01:15:02.598 --> 01:15:06.534
She was the most beautiful
blonde in all of New Orleans.

01:15:08.737 --> 01:15:11.207
Don't make the same mistake I made.

01:15:11.407 --> 01:15:16.238
Letting Elsa go...
is the biggest mistake of my life.

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.881
Elsa!

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:51.281
Elsa, what is it? I need to talk to you!

01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:55.249
No, Fred. Let's talk tonight, all right?

01:15:59.287 --> 01:16:01.010
You're my life, you know that?

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:12.115
Yes. Follow that cab, will you?

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:57.511
All right. Take me home.

01:17:26.107 --> 01:17:27.707
Elsa?

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:35.482
Elsa?

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:41.922
- Elsa?
- I'm in the bathroom.

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:44.919
I've cooked you dinner.

01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:47.494
I'm coming.

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:54.270
You've hardly eaten anything.

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:57.438
- I'm just not hungry.
- Would you like me to get you some tea?

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.675
I just want you to hold me.

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:20.724
This scene is practically pornographic.
What a woman.

01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:26.869
John, can I ask, what is the prognosis
for someone who's on dialysis?

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:29.238
- It depends.
- On what?

01:18:29.338 --> 01:18:32.775
The general state of the person,
lifestyle, age.

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.578
What are we talking about here, Fred?

01:18:35.778 --> 01:18:38.593
Oh, Elsa's on dialysis.

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:43.119
I was wondering what...
what is the best possible outlook?

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:46.222
I'd have to know her history, but...

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:48.558
But what? Tell me.

01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:52.945
Let's say it's not very promising
for a person of her age.

01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:56.233
She'll die?

01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:59.456
We all die eventually.

01:19:00.919 --> 01:19:02.972
I'm an idiot.

01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:06.131
Yes, you are an idiot, my friend.

01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:08.700
What time is it?

01:19:09.545 --> 01:19:12.179
It's a quarter to 5:00. Why?

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:15.683
Come with me.

01:19:55.657 --> 01:19:59.328
- Good evening.
- Well... thank you, Fred.

01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:01.430
Is this what you've been
doing all afternoon?

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:03.394
What plans do you have
for the next week?

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.399
Excuse me?

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.336
- Open it.
- What is this?

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:13.311
Read it, please.

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:16.546
Tickets!

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:21.450
- Rome. Your city, I believe?
- Oh, Fred!

01:20:22.373 --> 01:20:25.759
- Oh, I'm going to die of excitement.
- Oh, I hope not.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:10.733
You know, in the portrait that
Pablo did of me, he did my arm.

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:14.637
Yes. But then, my hand was
coming out of my shoulder.

01:21:14.737 --> 01:21:20.138
You're adorable, even though I
believe a third of what you say.

01:21:21.644 --> 01:21:26.546
You don't believe that Pablo
Picasso did a portrait of me?

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:31.053
I cannot be with such a mistrusting man.

01:21:31.153 --> 01:21:35.035
Okay, okay. I believe you.
I believe you.

01:21:43.098 --> 01:21:46.135
- Shall I tell him to pass by the fountain?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:51.192
I want to discover it at night, like Anita.
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

01:22:33.881 --> 01:22:35.317
You smile.

01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:55.291
Oh, Fred, this is all so extraordinary.

01:22:56.805 --> 01:23:00.276
I bet it cost you a fortune.
Did you take out a loan?

01:23:00.376 --> 01:23:02.879
- No, I stole the money.
- No, come on.

01:23:02.979 --> 01:23:05.179
Well, I just had it, that's all.

01:23:06.415 --> 01:23:10.318
I bet you never thought you would
spend it on something like this.

01:23:10.670 --> 01:23:14.290
You know, once upon a time someone
told me over an absurd restaurant bill,

01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:18.058
that some things are priceless.

01:23:23.213 --> 01:23:27.313
Did you see how they were
looking at you? Hello?

01:23:27.969 --> 01:23:30.571
This man is mine!

01:23:31.907 --> 01:23:35.799
Dad? In the bathroom? I don't know.

01:23:36.612 --> 01:23:38.480
I'm sorry. I don't know.
I don't know what to say.

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:41.217
- It's typical.
- Come on. Let's check the super.

01:23:41.617 --> 01:23:45.385
He left. But he told
me to give you this.

01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:48.124
He left?

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:51.393
"Dear Lydia,
about the investment that... "

01:23:51.493 --> 01:23:53.962
I think that if it says "dear Lydia,"
that it's for me to read.

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:56.014
"Dear Lydia, I've been
thinking about the investment

01:23:56.114 --> 01:23:58.701
"that you and Jack suggested, and I...

01:23:59.411 --> 01:24:01.637
"I decided to back out.

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:03.806
I realize that this will come
as a surprise to you,

01:24:03.906 --> 01:24:06.809
"and that you won't understand
why I'm acting the way I do.

01:24:06.909 --> 01:24:10.446
Well, I do. I'm currently in Ro... "
In Rome?!

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:13.247
- What?
- In Rome with Elsa!

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:18.154
"I decided to invest in our happiness.

01:24:18.254 --> 01:24:21.824
"I'm sure that you'll make things work,
in one way or another.

01:24:21.924 --> 01:24:25.294
- Oh, he...
- "One more thing, Lydia.

01:24:25.694 --> 01:24:27.129
I believe that I wasn't..."

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:30.766
Oh, my God. "I wasn't a very
good father to you. And I'm sorry.

01:24:30.966 --> 01:24:35.170
"Really, if in the next life, I'm still
your father, I'll try to make it up to you.

01:24:35.379 --> 01:24:36.605
Dad."

01:24:36.705 --> 01:24:41.744
He's even trying to be funny while he
screws us over. Say something, Lydia.

01:24:42.344 --> 01:24:46.182
My father's just never apologized. This is
the first time he's ever apologized to me.

01:24:46.282 --> 01:24:50.353
- He's wasting his money on that old broad!
- Instead of investing in you?

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:54.590
No, he's not interested
in the business, Jack!

01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:57.860
And, frankly, neither am I.
Honestly, if you want to do it,

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:02.830
you just have to find a way to do it
with your own money, okay? I love you.

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:10.645
Well, let's go...

01:25:11.507 --> 01:25:15.078
- to the fountain tonight.
- All right.

01:25:16.972 --> 01:25:19.148
- The cat.
- Cat? Which cat?

01:25:19.248 --> 01:25:22.685
The cat has to be exactly
like Anita's cat in the movie.

01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:24.453
It has to be white and small.

01:25:24.553 --> 01:25:27.623
But Elsa, where do you
think I'm going to...

01:25:27.723 --> 01:25:30.659
Oh, please, Fred. I've dreamed
about this for so long.

01:25:30.759 --> 01:25:33.461
It's got to be exactly
like I dreamed it, please.

01:26:43.130 --> 01:26:46.133
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Take your time.

01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:05.684
What do you think?

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:08.722
What can I say?

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:17.225
I'm so nervous.

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.471
- Il gatto?
- No, but not until we get to the fountain.

01:27:23.372 --> 01:27:26.074
- Amore, andiamo?
- Andiamo.

01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:44.126
I wish I could've brought
you here in the summertime.

01:27:44.226 --> 01:27:48.461
No, Fred. You brought me.
You're an absolute angel.

01:27:51.533 --> 01:27:53.969
The kitten. Let me have the kitten.

01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:57.328
- Oh. Oh, that's my baby.
- Sorry, I tried.

01:27:57.428 --> 01:27:59.675
- It's almost white.
- Let's just cover her.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:03.579
No. Well, we're not exactly
Anita and Marcello either, are we?

01:28:03.679 --> 01:28:06.348
- Oh, un bicchiere di latte.
- What?

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:08.813
- Do you have a glass of milk for the cat?
- What glass of milk?

01:28:08.913 --> 01:28:13.722
No, when they got here, just about here,
but not exactly... I don't think...

01:28:13.822 --> 01:28:17.526
she sent him off to a dairy
store to buy milk for the cat.

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:22.130
Elsa, Marcello didn't go to a dairy store.
One of the film crew got him the milk.

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:23.499
Please, Fred?

01:28:23.599 --> 01:28:25.768
- Fred, Fred, Fred.
- All right, all right.

01:28:25.868 --> 01:28:27.936
- Oh, my...
- You all right?

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:30.837
- Yes. Oh, yes.
- Just stay there. I'll be right back.

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:41.308
Sorry. I could only get yogurt.

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:47.679
Taste it. It's good. It's good.

01:29:50.419 --> 01:29:53.479
Marcello, come here.

01:29:53.979 --> 01:29:55.932
We're going to die of pneumonia!

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:59.793
Would this be such a
terrible place to die?

01:30:12.907 --> 01:30:15.542
He caresses her with his eyes.

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:21.168
He adores her as if
she were... a goddess.

01:30:23.051 --> 01:30:26.186
And then, it's just the two of them...

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:30.259
all alone in the world.

01:30:30.359 --> 01:30:34.230
The sound of the water disappears.

01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:39.583
My love, my Marcello,
I'm going to confess something now.

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:49.889
I love you more than I have
ever loved any person.

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:52.414
Thank you.

01:30:52.695 --> 01:30:55.594
No. Thank you.

01:30:55.694 --> 01:30:58.695
- Thank you. Thank you.
- No, thank you.

01:31:01.023 --> 01:31:03.857
I love you. I love you.

01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:14.307
Managed to open the safe.

01:32:15.699 --> 01:32:17.731
She left me a note.
She wanted you to have this.
