00:01.180 --> 00:02.932

- Tessa.

00:02.933 --> 00:05.548
<i>Someone is using Flirtual to
stalk and kill people.</i>

00:05.549 --> 00:06.852
<i>It was Sarah's birthday.</i>

00:06.853 --> 00:08.028
<i>I gave it to her as a present.</i>

00:08.029 --> 00:09.100
I'm sorry, Lindy.

00:09.101 --> 00:09.846
For which part?

00:09.847 --> 00:10.636
<i>Lying about being a cop?</i>

00:10.637 --> 00:11.363
I'm Ben.

00:11.364 --> 00:12.488
<i>Or when you turned me in?</i>

00:12.489 --> 00:13.412
Aah!

00:13.413 --> 00:15.035
<i>He only wanted me to scare her.</i>

00:15.036 --> 00:16.003
Who paid you?

00:16.629 --> 00:19.168
I don't know. That's not the way

Virtual city of illegal sites

02:12.979 --> 02:14.210
where anything and everything

02:14.211 --> 02:15.818
can be bought anonymously.

02:15.819 --> 02:16.770
(Tommy) People are selling

02:16.771 --> 02:18.002
their virginity, their internal

02:18.003 --> 02:19.298
organs, brokering murder,

02:19.299 --> 02:20.954
selling their own suicides.

02:21.722 --> 02:22.698
Yeager?

02:22.699 --> 02:23.778
We've tried to locate where

02:23.779 --> 02:25.218
this is run from, but it's

02:25.219 --> 02:26.250
untraceable.

02:26.551 --> 02:27.762
If we can get our hands on

02:27.763 --> 02:28.914
their user records, we'll have

02:28.915 --> 02:32.250
the identities of anyone who has
ever bought or sold anything

02:32.551 --> 02:34.206
on a Babylon site.

02:34.658 --> 02:36.491
Including the Flirtual killer.

02:37.578 --> 02:38.818
Exactly.

02:38.819 --> 02:40.738
We know he purchased you on the
Doll's house site,

02:40.739 --> 02:43.546
and Doll's House is hosted on the Babylon
portal.

02:43.547 --> 02:45.679
One shop in a giant
shopping mall.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.470
Which is why this footage
of Kent is so important.

02:48.471 --> 02:50.103
He's a lead we can follow,

02:50.104 --> 02:52.175
the first that we can actually
identify.

02:52.176 --> 02:55.286
This video originated on a
self-mutilation website

02:55.287 --> 02:56.806
posted on the Babylon portal.

02:57.107 --> 02:58.442
What do we know about him?

02:58.843 --> 03:00.646
Kent was one of the top
models in the world

03:00.647 --> 03:02.014
and became a photographer.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.167
He was all over the news a few
weeks ago,

03:05.168 --> 03:07.470
said he was stabbed in the
eye during a mugging.

03:07.471 --> 03:10.022
This guy's got a thing for
prostitutes, drugs,

03:10.023 --> 03:12.659
and definitely likes to live life
to the extreme.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.026
Why would he mutilate his eye

03:14.027 --> 03:15.506
if his eyes are his livelihood?

03:15.507 --> 03:17.243
I think someone made him do it.

03:18.450 --> 03:20.114
You stay and scour the Babylon portal

03:20.115 --> 03:21.715
for any other sign of Kent.

03:21.716 --> 03:24.186
You two, go talk to him.

03:25.087 --> 03:26.171
Let's go.

03:38.195 --> 03:39.171
Yeah?

03:39.172 --> 03:40.238
NYPD.

03:40.239 --> 03:41.176
I'm detective Calligan.

03:42.077 --> 03:44.374
We believe we may have a new
lead on Mr. Kent's case.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.146
Any of these men look familiar?

03:55.334 --> 03:58.286
I'm sorry to make you relive it,
but is there anything else you

03:58.287 --> 04:00.031
can remember about that night?

04:00.632 --> 04:02.608
It was so fast, I...

04:02.609 --> 04:05.806
The adrenaline kicked in and all
I could focus on was the knife.

04:07.086 --> 04:08.462
Then he stabbed me.

04:08.463 --> 04:11.614
He took my watch
and I lost my eye.

04:12.415 --> 04:14.291
A watch for an eye.

04:14.292 --> 04:15.906
Who are these men?

04:15.907 --> 04:18.683
We pulled footage from the
security cameras in Riverside Park

04:18.684 --> 04:21.410
and matched them to anyone
with a record of assault.

04:21.711 --> 04:23.244
Riverside Park?

04:23.245 --> 04:24.810
But that's not where
I was mugged.

04:26.674 --> 04:30.498
It says right here, Riverside
Park, 96th street.

04:32.242 --> 04:34.226
I was attacked on the east side.

04:38.018 --> 04:40.807
You think I'd forget a night
that ended like this?

04:44.023 --> 04:46.230
I'm very sorry we wasted
your time.

04:48.382 --> 04:50.455
I will do whatever I can to find
this guy.

04:51.966 --> 04:55.606
Instead of bothering you again, I'll
be e-mailing you some other suspects.

05:02.982 --> 05:04.350
That was quite a performance.

05:06.742 --> 05:08.834
Let's see if he takes the bait.

05:11.458 --> 05:12.811
Lindy's e-mailing him now.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.274
Kent opens it and we'll have
total access to his computer.

05:15.275 --> 05:18.138
Good work. Find anything?

05:18.139 --> 05:21.123
Prostitution ads, lots of them.

05:21.124 --> 05:23.259
But until we get inside Kent's computer,

05:23.260 --> 05:25.460
we're not gonna know
what he's bought on Babylon.

05:25.461 --> 05:26.730
Keep looking.

05:34.985 --> 05:36.089
I'm bored.

05:36.090 --> 05:37.792
(Sighing) Go write something.

05:37.793 --> 05:39.801
Doesn't it creep you out a
bit that the killer

05:39.802 --> 05:42.581
- hasn't killed anyone recently?
- No.

05:45.404 --> 05:48.060
Okay, yes, but I am trying to
focus on other things.

05:49.084 --> 05:50.285
Okay, are you gonna tell me
what's wrong

05:50.286 --> 05:51.732
or are you just gonna eat that pencil?

05:51.733 --> 05:53.268
It's Tessa, isn't it?

05:54.709 --> 05:56.564
Okay, she has been gone for
two full days.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.348
Okay, no text, no note.

05:58.349 --> 05:59.804
Her phone goes straight to
voice-mail.

05:59.805 --> 06:01.116
Gone? She just got here.

06:01.117 --> 06:02.212
I have to do something.

06:03.445 --> 06:05.557
Something drastic, something I
have never done before.

06:05.558 --> 06:06.797
Ooh, like what?

06:07.932 --> 06:11.046
- Call her parents.
- Hmm.

06:23.488 --> 06:24.865
Sarah?

06:30.320 --> 06:32.107
Looks like no one's home.
I'm headed to your room.

06:32.979 --> 06:33.859
Okay, I'm here.

06:35.323 --> 06:36.500
Good.

06:36.501 --> 06:38.026
I'm sending you the picture.

06:38.027 --> 06:40.332
I need you to scan all my photos of Sarah,

06:40.333 --> 06:42.155
see if any of the
faces match this ad.

06:47.580 --> 06:48.788
This is unbelievable.

06:48.789 --> 06:52.356
This picture of your sister wasn't
tampered with, or photoshopped.

06:52.957 --> 06:55.015
Lindy... it's real.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.943
What?

06:57.920 --> 06:59.833
- That means she's alive.
- No.

06:59.834 --> 07:03.254
I hope she is, but looking at
the date and location embedded

07:03.255 --> 07:05.174
in this picture's metadata,

07:05.967 --> 07:09.215
it was taken in your hometown,
three years ago.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.351
Sarah was using Babylon?

07:12.152 --> 07:13.516
What was she doing?

07:13.517 --> 07:15.475
Lindy, I think there's more
to this picture.

07:16.207 --> 07:17.231
What do you mean?

07:18.687 --> 07:20.612
That res poly look a little
off to you?

07:20.613 --> 07:23.067
I think there could be data
hidden inside.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.155
Like a picture inside
the picture?

07:25.156 --> 07:28.187
- Yes.
- I'll use a stego tool.

07:28.188 --> 07:31.667
If there's something in there,
I'll find it.

07:35.124 --> 07:37.861
It's a file.
Someone saved a file in here.

07:37.862 --> 07:39.445
- (Door closing)
- (Tessa) Hello?

07:39.446 --> 07:40.253
What was that?

07:40.554 --> 07:41.749
Hold on, someone's here.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.581
Don't tell Sophia about
this yet.

07:44.497 --> 07:45.689
Sure.

07:45.690 --> 07:46.673
Hi, Georgie.

07:47.289 --> 07:48.232
Tessa.

07:49.833 --> 07:50.998
Hi.

07:51.033 --> 07:53.410
- What are you doing here?
- Uh...

07:53.411 --> 07:55.652
All that computer stuff gives
me anxiety.

07:55.653 --> 07:58.609
Uh, yeah, I know, just
helping Linds with something.

07:58.910 --> 08:01.332
How long a something are we
talking about?

08:01.333 --> 08:03.237
'Cause I have a friend
stopping by.

08:03.738 --> 08:06.284
- A friend?
- A friend.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.236
Oh. That kind of a friend.

08:11.037 --> 08:13.343
- Yeah.
- Right.

08:14.991 --> 08:16.434
I'll just be a second.

08:18.835 --> 08:21.088
You won't even notice I'm here.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.002
George?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.456
<i>George, are you there?</i>

08:27.070 --> 08:28.451
I just sent you the file.

08:37.261 --> 08:41.450
This is my case file.
"Lindy Sampson, aka Magnifly."

08:41.451 --> 08:45.226
"First contact. Target."

09:10.830 --> 09:12.135
Hey, have you seen J.J.?

09:17.383 --> 09:19.127
Excuse me, do you know J.J.?

09:24.213 --> 09:26.141
- I'm looking for...
- J.J., yeah.

09:26.142 --> 09:27.525
I got that.

09:27.606 --> 09:29.398
He told me to meet him here.

09:29.399 --> 09:33.038
Hmm.
Nobody ever really meets J.J.

09:33.039 --> 09:36.318
I talked to him online and
he said to come here.

09:36.319 --> 09:37.557
Did he?

09:38.998 --> 09:40.334
You're his group, right?

09:41.235 --> 09:42.686
The outliers.

09:42.687 --> 09:44.958
He said that you people could
help me find my sister.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.682
Why would we help you?

09:46.683 --> 09:48.594
That's what you do.

09:48.595 --> 09:49.755
You're hacktivists.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.058
You help people when
the system fails.

09:51.059 --> 09:52.441
You a cop?

09:53.742 --> 09:55.225
You totally seem like a cop.

09:55.226 --> 09:57.746
- I'm not a cop.
- (Laughing)

09:58.447 --> 10:00.446
- I'm not a cop.
- Oh, yeah?

10:03.533 --> 10:04.861
Prove it.

10:07.073 --> 10:08.618
You've got 30 seconds.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.689
To do what?

10:10.724 --> 10:11.969
I don't know.

10:11.970 --> 10:14.625
Impress me? Oh.

10:15.813 --> 10:19.214
- 25 seconds.
- Okay.

10:27.230 --> 10:28.357
I see...

10:28.358 --> 10:29.525
You're on your own wireless

10:29.526 --> 10:32.269
network out of here that isn't
broadcasting it's SSID,

10:32.270 --> 10:33.629
but it's called outlair.

10:33.930 --> 10:35.989
That's where you guys hide out
for privacy.

10:35.990 --> 10:37.621
10 seconds.

10:42.221 --> 10:44.941
(Clicking tongue)

10:49.897 --> 10:52.645
Time's up. Show and tell.

11:03.669 --> 11:04.902
That's me.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.938
Yup.

11:08.939 --> 11:10.046
The real me.

11:10.547 --> 11:12.371
After I figured out your network's name,

11:12.372 --> 11:13.832
I cracked the encryption,

11:14.161 --> 11:16.788
I saw your web traffic and sniffed out your
session cookie,

11:16.789 --> 11:18.531
and then I signed on as you.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.136
- George Reyes.
- Shh!

11:22.788 --> 11:25.128
Oh, and look at all the
girls' photos I liked.

11:25.863 --> 11:26.932
What?

11:26.933 --> 11:28.439
(Chuckling) I didn't... no.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.543
I don't even... that's, uh...

11:33.044 --> 11:34.348
All right.

11:37.692 --> 11:41.948
Okay.
So you have some small skill.

11:43.132 --> 11:44.503
What's your name?

11:46.004 --> 11:47.276
Magnifly.

11:48.077 --> 11:50.612
Pleasure to meet you, Magnifly.

11:53.108 --> 11:55.788
(Distant siren wailing)

11:59.659 --> 12:01.716
(Phone ringing)

12:01.717 --> 12:03.255
(Beeping)

12:05.107 --> 12:06.352
Catherine?

12:06.353 --> 12:08.360
I think I found our way in.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.939
(Phone ringing)

12:29.940 --> 12:31.560
<i>Lindy, what did you find?</i>

12:31.561 --> 12:33.831
- The file is my case file.
- What?

12:33.832 --> 12:36.059
The Cyber Crimes Unit's case
against me.

12:36.060 --> 12:38.671
It's redacted. I can't read it.

12:38.972 --> 12:41.200
The original file's on
Catherine's computer.

12:41.501 --> 12:42.844
<i>It's him, Lindy.</i>

12:42.845 --> 12:44.347
<i>He's playing with you and now</i>

12:44.348 --> 12:46.868
<i>you find your case file inside a
picture of your sister?</i>

12:46.869 --> 12:48.331
The killer did this.

12:49.032 --> 12:50.395
It's all his plan.

12:50.796 --> 12:52.539
So what do we do?

12:56.588 --> 12:58.516
We need to hack the Cyber
Crimes Unit.

12:58.517 --> 13:01.172
Oh, I love it when you talk
dirty to me.

13:03.096 --> 13:04.249
Okay, then.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.403
Gotta go.

13:08.263 --> 13:09.855
- Lindy.
- (Gasping) Oh.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.261
- You're back.
- It worked.

13:12.262 --> 13:14.140
Kent's opened the e-mail,
we're on his computer.

13:15.277 --> 13:16.854
- Coming?
- Sure.

13:22.621 --> 13:24.661
We can see and record
everything he does.

13:24.662 --> 13:26.109
He's logging on to Babylon.

13:27.637 --> 13:28.573
There it is, a record of

13:28.574 --> 13:30.509
everything Kent's bought using
the portal.

13:33.269 --> 13:35.161
He's going back through all
the girls he bought.

13:37.865 --> 13:38.817
He deleted her.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.425
Edward Kent's ordered hundreds
of girls using the Babylon portal.

13:41.426 --> 13:42.697
Why would he delete just
that one?

13:42.898 --> 13:44.097
Find out who she is.

13:44.098 --> 13:45.449
Taking a screen grab.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.298
Using facial recognition to run
it through the DMV.

13:55.705 --> 13:56.929
What's wrong with her eye?

13:56.930 --> 13:58.329
Eye for an eye.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.543
- There's your motive.
- Eve Farmington.

14:02.431 --> 14:04.384
Go question her, now.

14:10.824 --> 14:12.072
Hey.

14:12.973 --> 14:14.373
You okay?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.204
Yeah, why?

14:16.205 --> 14:18.244
I don't know, you just seem
distracted.

14:20.123 --> 14:21.749
I should stay here.

14:21.750 --> 14:24.035
Monitor if Kent does anything
else on Babylon.

14:26.476 --> 14:28.164
Okay.

14:33.988 --> 14:35.044
(Phone ringing)

14:35.045 --> 14:36.372
<i>Okay, I'm in position.</i>

14:36.373 --> 14:37.637
<i>Okay, give me a few minutes.</i>

14:39.372 --> 14:40.348
May I have a word?

14:40.949 --> 14:42.563
Just wanted to talk.

14:42.564 --> 14:44.012
We haven't checked in
for a while.

14:44.913 --> 14:46.027
Okay.

14:46.228 --> 14:48.684
You know, I'm impressed with
the work that you've been doing

14:48.685 --> 14:51.939
for us and I don't impress
easily.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.800
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:53.901 --> 14:56.540
I'm learning so much
I didn't know.

14:56.541 --> 14:59.884
We should talk about how to
make your place here more...

14:59.885 --> 15:02.998
- Official.
- (Chuckling)

15:03.199 --> 15:05.740
(Alarm sounding)

15:05.741 --> 15:07.054
Okay, people, not sure what

15:07.055 --> 15:08.486
that is, but we gotta
move it out.

15:08.487 --> 15:10.230
Come on, let's go.

15:10.231 --> 15:12.198
Move, move, move.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.900
(Beeping)

15:32.787 --> 15:34.987
Lindy, where are you?

15:35.685 --> 15:39.395
(Beeping)

15:40.196 --> 15:41.563
It worked.

15:42.164 --> 15:43.564
I'm inside.

15:47.034 --> 15:50.690
(Indistinct radio chatter)

15:58.682 --> 15:59.310
<i>Here we go.</i>

15:59.813 --> 16:02.502
<i>I'm gonna grab her password hash
from memory and try and crack it.</i>

16:02.503 --> 16:04.366
Gas company says they're
sweeping the building.

16:04.367 --> 16:06.878
They'll have it fixed in the
next half hour, 45 minutes tops.

16:06.879 --> 16:09.078
Thanks. I couldn't have done it
without you.

16:09.079 --> 16:10.934
Aww, that's sweet.

16:10.935 --> 16:12.677
And very true, Linds, very true.

16:12.678 --> 16:14.510
Any luck breaking her password?

16:14.511 --> 16:17.010
Just need a little more time.

16:29.026 --> 16:30.049
Excuse me.

16:37.378 --> 16:38.953
Can I help you?

16:42.994 --> 16:44.394
You think I did this to him?

16:44.395 --> 16:46.266
Looks like he did it to himself.

16:46.267 --> 16:47.966
We know you were on Babylon.

16:49.214 --> 16:50.590
That was years ago.

16:54.182 --> 16:58.377
Edward Kent paid for your
services and then you stopped.

17:00.078 --> 17:01.273
Why?

17:01.274 --> 17:03.230
I was bored and stupid.

17:03.431 --> 17:05.781
A friend told me about this
place online, Babylon,

17:05.782 --> 17:07.253
where you could sell anything.

17:07.355 --> 17:12.366
I was making a lot of money living
the New York dream, until he bought me.

17:12.367 --> 17:15.630
I thought it was for sex, but he
was into something else.

17:15.830 --> 17:17.914
Woke up in the hospital
two days later.

17:18.515 --> 17:22.010
He had hit me so hard that the
doctors couldn't save my eye.

17:22.310 --> 17:23.934
Why didn't you go to the police?

17:24.778 --> 17:26.258
And say what?

17:26.259 --> 17:29.553
There's no justice for girls
like me, right, detective?

17:30.754 --> 17:34.546
Look, I didn't do this to Kent,
as much as he deserved it.

17:35.147 --> 17:38.194
We're trying to shut the
Babylon portal down, Eve.

17:38.195 --> 17:39.312
Help us.

17:40.371 --> 17:41.660
Shut Babylon down?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.799
You can't shut Babylon down.

17:47.415 --> 17:48.927
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

17:50.519 --> 17:51.239
She's lying.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.535
Who's she lying to protect?

17:52.536 --> 17:53.464
Not Kent.

17:53.499 --> 17:54.991
Who else has access to
Kent's computer?

17:54.992 --> 17:56.967
His assistant, Luca.

18:01.135 --> 18:03.240
Kent sent her to the hospital,
there should be a record of it.

18:03.241 --> 18:04.851
Under what name?
She changed her name.

18:04.852 --> 18:08.598
I'm not searching under her
name, I'm searching under Luca's.

18:11.334 --> 18:12.183
Look.

18:12.184 --> 18:14.914
Luca Marino brought a woman to
the hospital the night Eve was beaten.

18:15.552 --> 18:16.504
Jennifer Marino.

18:17.256 --> 18:18.392
His sister.

18:20.776 --> 18:21.464
It worked.

18:21.465 --> 18:23.160
- You're up.
- Yes!

18:23.561 --> 18:26.924
All right, just escalate
my privileges.

18:27.772 --> 18:33.236
Bypassing the file decryption,
and... bam, ba-ba-bam!

18:33.237 --> 18:34.604
I'm in. (Laughing)

18:34.605 --> 18:35.268
Thank you, George.

18:40.409 --> 18:41.600
<i>Looks safe.</i>

18:43.318 --> 18:45.135
They had me under surveillance?

18:47.742 --> 18:49.183
What?

18:49.991 --> 18:52.754
Lindy Sampson. She's perfect.

18:52.755 --> 18:54.507
That's what you said about
the others.

18:54.508 --> 18:58.818
She's different. She's
talented, pragmatic, creative.

18:58.819 --> 19:01.982
Dropped out of MIT but during
her first and only semester,

19:01.983 --> 19:03.518
she ranked top of her class.

19:03.519 --> 19:06.182
And she's guilty of several
illegal acts of hacktivism.

19:06.183 --> 19:08.391
Just the type to catch
Bubonic's attention.

19:08.392 --> 19:11.359
See, that's the best part.
She already has.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.535
She knows him under the alias
J.J.,

19:13.536 --> 19:15.651
the leader of a group of
hacktivists called the outliers.

19:15.652 --> 19:18.503
They're just a bunch of kids. They don't
even know who they're working for.

19:20.051 --> 19:21.098
What do you propose?

19:21.099 --> 19:22.538
I'll go undercover.

19:22.539 --> 19:24.150
Meet Lindy, become part of
her life.

19:24.151 --> 19:27.167
And when Bubonic does recruit
her, I'll be there.

19:27.168 --> 19:29.991
This is a bad idea.

19:31.592 --> 19:32.782
Why?

19:33.183 --> 19:35.647
Because we're using her
without her knowing, Tommy.

19:37.215 --> 19:39.678
Calligan, I'm granting your
request to go undercover.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.350
Am I the only one that
remembers what happened last

19:41.351 --> 19:43.303
time we tried to turn someone
against Bubonic?

19:44.631 --> 19:45.734
She ended up dead.

19:45.735 --> 19:47.382
Bubonic's a murderer and
a terrorist.

19:47.383 --> 19:50.206
I don't care how we catch him as
long as we do, and soon.

19:50.207 --> 19:52.022
Catherine, you are making
a mistake.

19:54.390 --> 19:56.315
You know what's not a mistake?

19:56.316 --> 19:58.698
Me standing on this side of
the desk.

19:59.299 --> 20:03.898
Run the operation, back Tommy up and maybe,
just maybe, we'll finally catch Bubonic.

20:04.499 --> 20:06.042
Thank you, detectives.

20:13.130 --> 20:16.242
- They were using me.
- What?

20:17.530 --> 20:20.658
All along.
It was Bubonic, George.

20:20.659 --> 20:23.186
I was Tommy's whole plan to
catch him.

23:55.798 --> 23:57.108
What are you calling me on?

23:57.409 --> 24:00.088
The killer led me down here,
left me a phone to find.

24:00.089 --> 24:01.185
Can you trace it?

24:01.186 --> 24:03.432
Yeah, I... I guess, I...
It's just gonna take some time.

24:10.577 --> 24:11.857

24:13.968 --> 24:15.321
We spoke to Jennifer Marino.

24:16.125 --> 24:17.053
I'm sorry?

24:18.519 --> 24:20.368
I don't understand.
I don't know who that is.

24:20.403 --> 24:23.366
Yes, you do. Only now
she calls herself Eve Farmington.

24:24.167 --> 24:26.910
You drove her to the hospital
after Kent beat her and then a

24:26.911 --> 24:28.518
week later, you were working
for him.

24:28.519 --> 24:30.669
We saw her face, Luca.

24:31.917 --> 24:33.294
An eye for an eye.

24:35.053 --> 24:37.014
You finally got the justice for
your sister.

24:37.615 --> 24:40.157
We can get a warrant and search
your hard drive in an hour.

24:40.358 --> 24:42.637
Are you really gonna tell us
that when we do, we're not gonna

24:42.638 --> 24:44.321
find a trail to Babylon?

24:45.122 --> 24:47.281
He had to be held accountable.

24:48.129 --> 24:49.297
Babylon sells a lot of things,

24:49.298 --> 24:52.233
girls, murder, revenge.

24:52.234 --> 24:54.433
Making Kent gouge his eye out

24:54.434 --> 24:56.617
using the site he first used to
buy my sister seemed like the

24:56.618 --> 24:58.002
only fair punishment.

24:58.003 --> 24:59.321
Is that why it took you two

24:59.322 --> 25:00.945
years to make Kent pay for what
he did?

25:01.546 --> 25:03.505
First, I had to find the
proper leverage.

25:04.106 --> 25:05.592
And what'd you find?

25:05.793 --> 25:07.697
He bought lots of them.

25:07.698 --> 25:10.897
Recorded what he did to them,
watched it over and over.

25:10.898 --> 25:12.913
You should be arresting him,
not me.

25:12.914 --> 25:14.009
We intend to.

25:14.010 --> 25:15.745
But it doesn't have to be
that way for you.

25:15.746 --> 25:18.261
Not if you help us find
whoever's behind Babylon.

25:18.262 --> 25:20.317
Nobody knows who runs that site.

25:20.318 --> 25:21.933
We know you pay them in bitcoin.

25:21.934 --> 25:23.381
Give us Babylon's bitcoin

25:23.382 --> 25:27.133
wallet, and maybe I'll speak to
