Whoa, way to go, RT.

01:05.377 --> 01:06.744
A few more chunks like that

01:06.844 --> 01:08.844
and we'll have enough to power the quantum scanners.

01:08.944 --> 01:12.344
Eh, I got a nose for energon, kid.

01:12.444 --> 01:15.778
Used to be the best miner in the Vespa system.

01:15.878 --> 01:18.879
Not to mention that this whole area's reading

01:18.979 --> 01:21.113

Eh, you're so funny.

01:27.780 --> 01:30.748
So now I'm nothing more

Nothing could've survived that blast.

03:20.365 --> 03:23.400
Oh, Waspinator thinks Megatron

03:23.500 --> 03:25.900
will be pleased with us.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.867
Yes. We must report to him at once.

04:18.542 --> 04:22.443
The explosion must've knocked out my internal systems.

04:22.543 --> 04:23.809
( grunts )

04:23.909 --> 04:26.309
Including my optic sensors.

04:26.410 --> 04:28.077
I'm blind.

04:28.177 --> 04:31.711
My eyes. My eyes!

Dinobot?

RATTRAP: Rhinox?

04:35.211 --> 04:36.545
Where are you, buddy?

04:36.645 --> 04:39.012
It's darker than the inferno out here.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.880
Rhinox, Rattrap, help me! I can't see!

04:42.979 --> 04:45.113
DINOBOT: What have they done to my eyes?

04:45.213 --> 04:48.747
CHEETOR: Rhinox, help me. What happened? Where are we?

04:48.847 --> 04:52.580
Listen to me! You've all got to calm down.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.082
Calm down?

04:56.181 --> 04:59.015
We can't see!

04:59.115 --> 05:02.282
The energon explosion contaminated our systems.

05:02.382 --> 05:06.316
Our optical sensors, and just about everything else,

05:06.417 --> 05:08.450
are offline.

05:08.550 --> 05:11.984
So, uh, so what do we do?

05:12.084 --> 05:14.018
We've got to transform.

05:14.118 --> 05:16.551
It'll slow down the contamination.

05:16.651 --> 05:19.819
Possibly regenerate our systems.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.452
Beast mode.

05:25.887 --> 05:28.620
Eh, beast mode.

05:37.188 --> 05:41.623
Oh, slag. That was weird.

05:41.722 --> 05:44.189
And I still can't see.

05:44.289 --> 05:45.956
Me neither.

05:46.056 --> 05:50.524
I'll tear Scorponok's processor out for this.

05:50.624 --> 05:52.791
And Waspinator's too.

05:52.891 --> 05:56.224
It's worse than I thought.

05:56.324 --> 05:59.492
Our only chance is to make it back to the base.

05:59.592 --> 06:00.626
( grunts )

06:00.726 --> 06:02.259
Are you insane?

06:02.359 --> 06:05.759
How can we get to the base when we can't see?

06:05.859 --> 06:08.560
There's more than one way to see, Dinobot.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.994
Besides, we don't have a choice.

06:12.094 --> 06:15.294
If we don't reach an R chamber in about 60 cycles,

06:15.394 --> 06:18.796
the contamination will put our sparks out.

06:18.895 --> 06:20.729
For good.

06:20.829 --> 06:22.329

06:35.298 --> 06:37.398

06:37.498 --> 06:40.032
Go back there now and make certain.

06:40.132 --> 06:42.533
SCORPONOK: Yes, yes, of course, Megatron.

06:42.633 --> 06:45.633
I told Waspinator we should've done that.

07:02.736 --> 07:05.637
We could only be in a swamp.

07:05.736 --> 07:07.804
You're catching on, Dinobot.

07:07.904 --> 07:10.070
We just follow our noses and--

07:10.171 --> 07:12.937
( crashing )

07:14.905 --> 07:18.105
Why are you stopping?

Hey, look out, will you? That's my foot, moron.

What's happening? Are we under attack?

08:05.447 --> 08:06.780

09:41.229 --> 09:44.129
And I feel kind of cold.

09:44.229 --> 09:47.430
Leave him. He'll only slow us down.

09:47.529 --> 09:50.363
Maximals don't abandon their own kind.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.697
On my back, Cheetor.

09:52.797 --> 09:55.698
Yeah, let's go, kiddo.

09:55.798 --> 09:57.798
( static over comm link )

09:59.965 --> 10:03.599
Optimus to Tigatron.

10:03.699 --> 10:05.866
Tigatron, do you copy?

10:05.966 --> 10:07.700
Tigatron here.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.000
Any sign of Rhinox and the others yet?

10:10.100 --> 10:11.134
Negative.

10:11.234 --> 10:12.668
They're not in grid Orion.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.067
Move to grid Alpha.

10:14.167 --> 10:16.235
I'm going to put Sentinel on automatic

10:16.334 --> 10:17.469
and search from the air.

10:17.568 --> 10:20.035
If you spot them, relay a message to Airazor.

10:20.135 --> 10:21.769
I've centered us scout grid Delta.

10:21.869 --> 10:23.735
Will do. Good hunting.

10:23.836 --> 10:26.236
Tigatron out.

10:26.336 --> 10:28.303
( hawk screaming distantly )

10:31.404 --> 10:33.337

10:35.104 --> 10:39.839
Waspinator thinks Maximals were vaporized.

10:39.939 --> 10:42.105
There should be some wreckage.

10:42.206 --> 10:45.439
Fly higher. Scan for energon traces.

10:55.441 --> 11:00.275
Oh. Waspinator sees trail of energon.

11:00.375 --> 11:03.943
Maybe Maximals did survive.

11:04.043 --> 11:07.843
Oh, follow it. We have to find them and finish them

11:07.943 --> 11:10.243
or Megatron will scrap us.

11:12.877 --> 11:14.711
( sniffing )

11:14.811 --> 11:18.479
I smell water. Fresh water.

11:18.579 --> 11:20.412
And I can hear it falling.

11:20.512 --> 11:23.579
Is it the base, Rhinox?

11:23.679 --> 11:26.847
No, but it should be one of the falls

11:26.947 --> 11:28.580
which feeds the base.

11:28.680 --> 11:32.147
If we get to it we can follow it.

11:32.247 --> 11:33.948
Hang on, Cheetor.

11:34.048 --> 11:35.714
We're gonna make it.

11:35.814 --> 11:37.881
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

11:37.981 --> 11:40.149
Gonna-- Gonna make it.

11:40.248 --> 11:44.015
Just so tired.

11:44.116 --> 11:46.050
( ominous theme playing )

11:46.150 --> 11:49.350
Megatron,

11:49.450 --> 11:53.584
I'm getting an odd reading at coordinates 903.

11:53.684 --> 11:57.151
It looks like walking energon.

11:57.251 --> 12:01.219
Hm, obviously one or more of the Maximals

12:01.319 --> 12:03.953
survived Scorponok's inept ambush

12:04.053 --> 12:06.053
and is now contaminated.

12:06.153 --> 12:08.653
Send Terrorsaur to those coordinates.

12:08.753 --> 12:12.287
Seek and destroy.

12:17.754 --> 12:19.755
( birds chirping )

12:23.856 --> 12:26.223
Oh, we made it.

12:26.323 --> 12:29.957
What did you say?

12:30.057 --> 12:33.691
I said we made it to the waterfall.

12:33.791 --> 12:37.924
What a startling revelation.

12:39.625 --> 12:42.292
RATTRAP: Hey, guys, over here.

12:42.392 --> 12:44.326
( sniffing )

12:44.426 --> 12:46.026
What is it?

12:46.127 --> 12:48.793
I think we can cross.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.393
Just give me a cycle.

12:50.494 --> 12:51.994
I'm gonna check it out.

12:52.094 --> 12:53.594
( grunts )

13:23.332 --> 13:26.132

13:26.233 --> 13:29.766
It's good. Come on.

13:29.867 --> 13:31.867
( suspenseful theme playing )

13:38.735 --> 13:40.969
There you are.

13:41.069 --> 13:44.402
Oh, is something wrong with Maximals?

13:44.503 --> 13:45.769
( laughing )

13:45.870 --> 13:48.203
Oh, they can't see.

13:48.303 --> 13:51.003
This will be easy.

13:53.704 --> 13:57.171
Wait a minute. I hear some--

13:57.271 --> 13:59.272
( suspenseful theme playing )

14:01.138 --> 14:03.139
( all yelling )

14:19.075 --> 14:22.408
Waspinator must find wreckage of Maximals

14:22.509 --> 14:24.675
to take back to Megatron.

14:24.775 --> 14:26.610
Waspinator.

14:26.710 --> 14:30.444
Megatron sent me to aid your search.

14:30.543 --> 14:32.511
Not necessary.

14:32.611 --> 14:37.011
Waspinator has already found and destroyed Maximals.

14:37.111 --> 14:39.144
Show me.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.246
( bird caws )

14:47.312 --> 14:48.913

( panting )

14:59.215 --> 15:02.249
( all coughing )

15:04.916 --> 15:07.583
Oh, I've had enough water

15:07.682 --> 15:10.717
to last me a stellar lifetime.

15:10.817 --> 15:14.917
Hey, you and me both, pussycat.

15:15.017 --> 15:18.118
What irony.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.851
For a warrior like me

15:19.951 --> 15:23.685
to go out blind, wet and helpless.

15:23.785 --> 15:25.353
( grunts )

15:25.453 --> 15:28.520
We're-- We're not finished yet.

15:28.620 --> 15:32.220
Spare me your eternal optimism.

15:32.320 --> 15:36.088
Waspinator will be back this time.

15:36.188 --> 15:38.188
( action theme playing )

15:52.590 --> 15:55.458
Ha, ha, destroy them, did you?

15:55.558 --> 15:59.125
Waspinator is sick of stupid Maximals.

15:59.224 --> 16:04.125
This time we'll make sure of their destruction.

16:09.159 --> 16:10.760
What do we do, Rhinox?

16:10.860 --> 16:14.327
Nowhere to run, so we fight.

16:14.427 --> 16:16.227
Transform, now!

16:16.327 --> 16:18.694
Are you insane? We can't.

16:18.794 --> 16:23.029
For once, just do what Rhinox says, will you, chopper face?

16:35.497 --> 16:36.731
Where are they?

16:36.831 --> 16:39.398
Oh, we're scrap, man, we're scrap.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.465
How can we hit what we cannot see?

16:41.565 --> 16:44.099
Maximals, listen to me.

16:45.965 --> 16:48.666
Picture a targeting grid in your head.

16:48.766 --> 16:52.600
Like the one we used in practice simulations.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.867
Do you see it?

16:54.967 --> 16:56.201
( growls )

16:56.301 --> 16:58.167
This is absurd.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.502
Concentrate. You can do it.

17:09.703 --> 17:12.037
CHEETOR: I-- I can see it.

17:12.137 --> 17:13.404
Yeah.

17:13.504 --> 17:15.671
Yeah. Yeah, me too. But--

17:15.771 --> 17:17.005
RHINOX: They're coming in.

17:17.105 --> 17:20.138
Stand your ground and listen for my instructions.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.340
Get ready.

17:32.773 --> 17:35.207
Cheetor, vector 5-3-7.

17:35.307 --> 17:37.941
Rattrap, vector 5-4-2.

17:38.041 --> 17:41.075
Dinobot, vector 5-5-4.

17:41.175 --> 17:42.708
On my mark.

17:42.808 --> 17:45.543
Fire.

17:45.643 --> 17:47.709
( shrieking )

17:51.243 --> 17:52.610
( yells )

17:52.710 --> 17:55.278
Not possible.

18:03.978 --> 18:06.579
( growling softly )

18:06.679 --> 18:09.313
Tigatron, maximize!

18:11.113 --> 18:14.047
Tigatron to Optimus Primal. Can you read me?

18:14.147 --> 18:17.581
Rattrap, vector 1-3-9, quick!

18:21.248 --> 18:23.749
( Waspinator yelling )

18:29.516 --> 18:32.017
All right, we-- Oh.

18:32.117 --> 18:34.250
( grunting )

18:34.350 --> 18:35.884
Cheetor!

18:35.984 --> 18:38.418
What's happen--

18:38.518 --> 18:40.985
Hey, what's--

18:43.252 --> 18:47.519
Transforming speeded the contamination.

18:47.619 --> 18:49.853
They're all in stasis lock.

18:49.953 --> 18:51.487
( dramatic theme playing )

18:51.587 --> 18:54.587
Rhinox, maximize!

18:54.687 --> 18:56.054
( grunting )

19:00.821 --> 19:03.822
OPTIMUS: Rhinox!

19:10.423 --> 19:12.190
Optimus.

19:12.290 --> 19:15.624
I knew you'd--

19:17.658 --> 19:19.258
Optimus to Tigatron.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.358
Code X.

19:28.493 --> 19:30.493
( suspenseful theme playing )

19:41.895 --> 19:43.728
RATTRAP: Hey, buddy.

19:43.828 --> 19:45.729
Hey, good to see you.

19:45.828 --> 19:47.729
And thanks.

19:47.829 --> 19:50.096
Goes double for me, big guy.

19:50.196 --> 19:51.363
( growls )

19:51.463 --> 19:55.797
I suppose you did do a commendable job out there.

19:55.897 --> 19:58.631
If Rhinox hadn't gotten you as far as he did,

19:58.731 --> 20:01.431
we'd have never gotten you back to the R chamber in time.

20:01.531 --> 20:04.232
We're just lucky you arrived when you did.

20:04.332 --> 20:08.766
But all in all I'd say it was a good experience for us.

20:08.866 --> 20:10.233
Good?

20:10.333 --> 20:13.833
What in the infernal was good about it?

20:13.934 --> 20:18.467
We never really appreciated what we're capable of in beast form.

20:18.568 --> 20:22.235
Now we know.

20:24.735 --> 20:28.269
I'm gonna go smell some flowers.

20:28.369 --> 20:30.269
( dramatic theme playing )

20:31.436 --> 20:33.204
Eh, you know,

20:33.304 --> 20:37.071
you gotta love the big lug nut.

20:46.406 --> 20:48.439
