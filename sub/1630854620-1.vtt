Are you ready
for your present?

00:38.611 --> 00:40.848
Oh, Darla, that's lovely.

00:40.848 --> 00:42.586
But it's never going to fit.

00:42.586 --> 00:46.059
Well, not with that attitude
it's not.

01:02.091 --> 01:04.328
I can't return it.
I'm not gonna return it.

01:04.328 --> 01:06.099
The antlers are slimming.
The sweater will make him

01:06.099 --> 01:07.268
look fat.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.506
Don't you body shame
our dog.

01:09.506 --> 01:11.877
The holidays suck!

01:11.877 --> 01:14.015
Breathe, Jill, breathe.

01:14.015 --> 01:15.885
Uh, can you bring it down
a skosh?

01:15.885 --> 01:17.187
I'm trying to squeeze in
a quick nap

01:17.187 --> 01:19.826
before nap time.
- How can you sleep?

01:19.826 --> 01:21.162
You know how every
The Holidays,

01:21.162 --> 01:23.366
Jill gets so stressed
when her mom and Nathan visit.

01:23.366 --> 01:25.972
And you know how stressed I get
when Jill's stressed.

01:25.972 --> 01:28.276
It's just all so stressful!
Aaah!

01:28.276 --> 01:31.215
If I put my mom's decorations
up before she gets here,

01:31.215 --> 01:33.721
our relationship might
finally turn a corner.

01:33.721 --> 01:35.257
Okay.

01:35.257 --> 01:38.096
That's a collectible.
Do I want to put that out?

01:38.096 --> 01:40.100
This year,
I was really hoping

01:40.100 --> 01:41.537
Jill would advocate
for herself.

01:41.537 --> 01:44.208
And I was hoping you'd stop
being a wet blanket

01:44.208 --> 01:46.312
so we could have some
The Holidays fun.

01:46.312 --> 01:49.753
Oh! Let's get our heads stuck
in presents and panic.

01:49.753 --> 01:51.890
Would you stop?

01:51.890 --> 01:52.859
I'm trying to have...

01:52.859 --> 01:54.228
A serious--
- Aah! Help!

01:54.228 --> 01:56.165
I'm stuck
in this present somehow.

01:56.165 --> 01:57.969
This is awesome.

01:57.969 --> 01:59.873
Also, this is terrifying.

01:59.873 --> 02:01.777
Mom's hideous ceramic wreath.

02:01.777 --> 02:03.748
I just have to get that up.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.920
Oh, we're not ready, Jill.
We're not ready!

02:06.920 --> 02:09.793
- Hello, Jill.
- Hello, Honey.

02:09.793 --> 02:11.630
Nathan. Merry The Holidays.

02:11.630 --> 02:13.033
We'll see.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.003
Grandma and Uncle Nathan
are here!

02:16.139 --> 02:19.178
Oh, sorry, Mom.
I'm such a klutz.

02:19.178 --> 02:21.282
It's not your fault.

02:21.282 --> 02:23.788
I should have stopped
having kids at none.

02:23.888 --> 02:25.625
Zing.

02:27.896 --> 02:29.265
Pet me, Jill.
We both need it.

02:29.265 --> 02:31.436
Please, for the love
of all that is holy,

02:31.537 --> 02:33.808
pet me, you beautiful
son of a bitch!

02:33.808 --> 02:35.277
God, she's pathetic.

02:35.277 --> 02:38.918
If this isn't the last
The Holidays we spend here,

02:38.918 --> 02:40.788
I'm going to ask
for a woodchipper

02:40.788 --> 02:42.559
so I can fly into it.

02:42.559 --> 02:45.665
Maybe there's a way
to spice things up a little.

02:45.665 --> 02:46.867
Ooh.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.804
Oh, Chief, ol' boy.

02:48.804 --> 02:51.075
Look, Kris Kringle has arrived.

02:51.175 --> 02:52.779
Hurry! Warn everyone.

02:52.779 --> 02:54.382
Aah! He's here!

02:54.382 --> 02:57.756
Kris Kringle's here!
Here, here, here!

02:57.756 --> 02:59.091
Chief.

02:59.091 --> 03:02.131
You're so sparkly
and beautiful.

03:02.131 --> 03:04.001
No, don't lick me. Don't.

03:04.001 --> 03:05.705
God, just because
you're a dog

03:05.705 --> 03:07.942
doesn't mean you have to act
like one.

03:07.942 --> 03:09.011
Ouch.

03:10.247 --> 03:12.151
Here, Honey,
let me get that.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.821
Aah!

03:13.821 --> 03:14.923
Get it out. Get it out!

03:14.923 --> 03:15.992
Oh, no!
That is glued in there.

03:15.992 --> 03:19.131
We have to get her to the vet
to remove it. Stat!

03:19.131 --> 03:20.501
Because of you,

03:20.501 --> 03:22.872
I'm spending The Holidays
at the vet!

03:24.543 --> 03:25.477
Aw.

03:25.645 --> 03:28.316
It's okay. I know
Chief didn't mean to do this.

03:28.316 --> 03:29.318
Well, of course he didn't.

03:29.318 --> 03:31.857
That's why he needs
discipline and structure.

03:31.857 --> 03:33.093
And you offer none of that.

03:33.193 --> 03:35.097
Bad owner. Bad owner!

03:35.097 --> 03:37.101
- Ugh.
- Okay, Mom.

03:37.101 --> 03:38.671
I know what you're thinking.

03:38.671 --> 03:40.808
Just say it.

03:40.808 --> 03:42.177
I hate your haircut.

03:44.348 --> 03:46.553
♪ Deck the halls
with Davey Spadey ♪

03:46.553 --> 03:48.389
♪ Deedle-deedle-dee,
da-beep-bop-boop ♪

03:48.389 --> 03:51.162
Our first annual
Holi-Dave Bash!

03:51.162 --> 03:53.099
Oh, I miss my old Ray,

03:53.099 --> 03:55.905
but man, am I glad he left us
to Spade.

03:55.905 --> 03:57.509
He and I are BFFs already.

03:57.509 --> 04:01.349
And I overheard him saying
I'm gonna be the Christmas ham!

04:01.349 --> 04:03.954
- What?
- Oh, don't be jealous.

04:03.954 --> 04:05.424
Performing is in my blood.

04:05.424 --> 04:07.862
So if anyone's gonna ham it up
for the guests,

04:07.862 --> 04:09.098
it's gonna be me.

04:09.098 --> 04:12.204
I'm planning this one
really hammy bit

04:12.204 --> 04:15.912
where I shove streamers
in my snout and ka-pow!

04:15.912 --> 04:17.916
Um, Max?
I don't think that's

04:17.916 --> 04:20.688
what they're looking for
from the Christmas ham.

04:21.623 --> 04:24.128
Ah, we'll get
that pinecone out of there.

04:24.128 --> 04:26.399
It's a simple procedure.
No harm done.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.136
What about
the emotional trauma?

04:28.136 --> 04:29.438
And not just from this,

04:29.438 --> 04:32.177
but the trauma of living
with Chief and Jill.

04:32.177 --> 04:33.914
Not that you care about that.

04:33.914 --> 04:35.852
Typical western medicine ideology.

04:35.852 --> 04:37.387
Whoa!

04:37.387 --> 04:40.193
Don't you realize you have
to treat the whole dog?

04:40.193 --> 04:42.431
Ooh, pills!

04:42.431 --> 04:44.401
Ooh, these should take
the edge off.

04:44.401 --> 04:46.707
Hey, Doc, are you single?

04:46.707 --> 04:49.579
Don't look at her now.
Her hair will grow out.

04:50.882 --> 04:52.652
Ooh, pills.

04:57.261 --> 04:58.831
Oh, golden Buddha-Dog,

04:58.931 --> 05:02.739
why can't I be part of a family
that's more like me?

05:06.880 --> 05:08.551
- Eat me?
- Yes.

05:08.551 --> 05:11.155
That's what Spade means
by Christmas ham.

05:11.155 --> 05:13.159
Okay, Larrabee, please.

05:13.159 --> 05:14.461
Come on, Max.

05:14.461 --> 05:17.467
The incomparable Dana Carvey
is here.

05:17.569 --> 05:20.106
You're the dinner,
not the theater.

05:20.106 --> 05:22.077
Oh, my God!

05:25.016 --> 05:26.285
Yeah, ooh.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.789
Right there, right there.

05:30.327 --> 05:32.799
Spade's gonna eat me.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.707
Max? Max.

05:36.707 --> 05:37.742
Where are you?

05:37.742 --> 05:39.445
Where's my yummy boy?

05:39.445 --> 05:41.249
Oh, crap.

05:41.249 --> 05:42.451
I gotta get out of here.

05:42.451 --> 05:45.858
Don't tell Spade
I've never seen "Tommy Boy"!

05:47.929 --> 05:49.398
Jill. Jill.

05:49.398 --> 05:53.439
Jill!
- Hi, Honey.

05:53.439 --> 05:55.845
Do I get to go home
with you?

05:57.715 --> 05:58.984
Happy The Holidays,

05:58.984 --> 06:00.120
please hold.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.291
Happy The Holidays,
please hold.

06:02.291 --> 06:04.228
No, we don't euthanize pets
on Christmas.

06:04.228 --> 06:05.230
Happy The Holidays,

06:05.230 --> 06:07.034
please hold. What?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.469
We're here for Lady Capulet.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.373
Poodle, right?

06:10.373 --> 06:12.377
I'm getting her, all right?

06:12.377 --> 06:14.315
Can Bernstein work Christmas?

06:14.315 --> 06:16.520
Sure, Bernstein can always
work Christmas.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.757
But does he ever get off
for Tu BiShvat?

06:18.757 --> 06:20.026
Nooo.

06:20.026 --> 06:22.497
Now, come on, Lady Capulet.

06:22.497 --> 06:25.203
Unlike Bernstein,
you get to go home.

06:28.409 --> 06:31.516
Hey, welcome back.
The pinecone's gone.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.654
You must be in a really good
and forgiving mood,

06:33.654 --> 06:35.591
right, Honey?
- Sure thing, sweetie.

06:35.691 --> 06:38.096
Wait, why aren't you yelling?

06:38.096 --> 06:40.835
I can yell
if you want me to!

06:40.835 --> 06:43.741
Uh, okay, go ahead, Honey.
Lay it on me.

06:43.741 --> 06:47.281
I'm a dummy.
Stupid. Unculturalized.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.285
Just say whatever it is
you're gonna say.

06:49.285 --> 06:52.558
Let's go find a hornet's nest
and pee on it!

06:52.558 --> 06:55.631
Wait, I've been begging you
to pee on hornets' nests

06:55.631 --> 06:58.269
for years, and suddenly
you're excited about it?

06:58.269 --> 07:01.877
Maybe that pinecone surgery
caused serious brain damage.

07:01.877 --> 07:03.514
The fun kind!

07:03.514 --> 07:06.419
Come on, let's go piss off
some hornets, Honey.

07:06.419 --> 07:09.158
Okay, darling.

07:10.828 --> 07:13.667
Oh, is-is it out?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.303
Phew. What a relief.

07:15.303 --> 07:18.376
I could not go through life
with a pinecone hanging off me

07:18.376 --> 07:21.182
like some kind
of 2005 geo-prism.

07:21.182 --> 07:23.086
That was good.

07:23.086 --> 07:25.758
Uh, Guernico,
I don't believe that's Lady.

07:25.758 --> 07:27.127
She's similar in appearance,

07:27.127 --> 07:30.433
yet she's not nearly
as obnoxious and dimwitted.

07:30.433 --> 07:32.337
Indeed, Caravaggio.

07:32.437 --> 07:34.375
Perhaps it's best if we keep
that to ourselves.

07:34.375 --> 07:37.314
Hello there.
Um, where am I?

07:37.314 --> 07:39.418
You're at the Van Amburgs.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.188
Those are our humans.

07:41.288 --> 07:42.424
The ones with the books?

07:42.424 --> 07:44.461
We've never actually
seen their faces.

07:44.461 --> 07:46.499
Whoa. Real intellectuals?

07:46.499 --> 07:48.637
But we shouldn't
be conversing.

07:48.637 --> 07:51.275
We are in a sit stay,
which is quiet time

07:51.275 --> 07:52.812
to think and reflect.

07:52.812 --> 07:54.983
No way. I never get
to think and reflect.

07:54.983 --> 07:56.385
But how did I get here?

07:56.385 --> 07:59.224
Dogs, enrichment corner.

07:59.224 --> 08:01.329
Wait, enrichment corner?

08:01.329 --> 08:03.834
I'm with a family
that's more like me?

08:03.834 --> 08:05.337
But how?

08:05.337 --> 08:07.307
<i>Why can't I be
part of a family</i>

08:07.307 --> 08:09.512
<i>that's more like me?</i>

08:09.512 --> 08:11.215
My wish was granted!

08:11.215 --> 08:13.086
I'm in one of those classic

08:13.086 --> 08:16.593
magical The Holidays
life swap switcheroos!

08:16.593 --> 08:18.764
We'll be right back.

08:22.070 --> 08:23.339
<i>Dogs, dinner.</i>

08:25.310 --> 08:27.949
Wait. Wait.

08:27.949 --> 08:28.684
Wait.

08:28.684 --> 08:29.819
- This is incredible.
- Wait.

08:29.919 --> 08:31.322
- I've waited my whole life...
- Wait.

08:31.322 --> 08:33.292
To experience
delayed gratification.

08:33.292 --> 08:34.395
- Wait.
- And now it's here.

08:34.395 --> 08:35.831
Soon!
- Wait.

08:35.831 --> 08:37.635
Wait. Wait.

08:37.635 --> 08:39.839
Dogs, dine.

08:39.839 --> 08:42.678
Mmm. Oh.
Oh, it tastes so much better

08:42.678 --> 08:45.417
than it would have
20 seconds ago.

08:50.326 --> 08:52.030
I can't believe
I've been rolling around

08:52.030 --> 08:55.437
in human waste by myself
all these years.

08:55.437 --> 08:57.441
Thanks for joining me, Honey.

08:57.441 --> 08:59.478
Any time, pumpkin.

08:59.478 --> 09:01.750
Aw. What should we do next?

09:01.750 --> 09:03.219
Oh, I know. We should...

09:03.219 --> 09:04.989
Eat each other's vomit.

09:06.660 --> 09:08.029
Dogs, leave it.

09:08.029 --> 09:11.368
Self-control is so awesome.
I can barely stand it.

09:11.368 --> 09:12.972
Mm-mm.

09:12.972 --> 09:16.646
Eat a lot so our poops are
festive through the summer.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.153
Dogs, music.

09:23.192 --> 09:26.065
Five, seven, one. Go!

09:26.065 --> 09:27.434
Cardio!

09:27.434 --> 09:28.937
Cardi B.

09:28.937 --> 09:31.175
Dogs, martini.

09:40.026 --> 09:44.602
Good dog.

09:44.602 --> 09:47.708
I'm living my best life!

09:47.708 --> 09:49.712
Nobody tells you
the hardest part

09:49.712 --> 09:51.750
about your owner
wanting to eat you

09:51.750 --> 09:55.290
is being alone
for The Holidays.

10:11.857 --> 10:14.094
Happy The Holidays,
my friend.

10:14.094 --> 10:16.065
What's so happy about it?

10:16.065 --> 10:20.340
It's the one time of year
I visit all 324 of my kids.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.776
Oh, just like Nick Cannon.

10:21.776 --> 10:23.580
Well, then I won't bother you.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.584
No, please bother me.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.622
Kids, go play in traffic.

10:27.622 --> 10:28.991
That'll cut their numbers
in half.

10:28.991 --> 10:31.262
You are a good dad, Raccoon.

10:31.262 --> 10:32.732
Much better than Spade.

10:32.732 --> 10:35.470
He wants to eat me,
so I'm running away.

10:35.470 --> 10:36.907
You know what you should do?

10:36.907 --> 10:39.646
Get yourself
a Jewish celebrity this time.

10:39.646 --> 10:42.117
They're less likely to put you
on the menu.

10:42.117 --> 10:43.252
Hmm.

10:43.252 --> 10:45.190
Jewish celebrity?

10:45.190 --> 10:46.760
Jewish celebrity!

10:46.760 --> 10:49.298
Where are you,
Jewish celebrity?

10:49.298 --> 10:51.202
Oh, Spider-Man.

10:51.202 --> 10:52.705
That's Jewish, right?

10:54.509 --> 10:56.580
Checkmate.

10:56.580 --> 10:58.584
I love it here.

10:58.584 --> 11:01.723
I've never been happier
or more disciplined.

11:01.723 --> 11:04.562
Thank you for your hospitality.

11:04.562 --> 11:06.633
How dare you lick

11:06.633 --> 11:09.572
Teri Van Amburg on the face!

11:09.572 --> 11:11.308
I think I'm going to be sick.

11:11.308 --> 11:13.145
Oh, what?
At my old house,

11:13.145 --> 11:16.520
showing affection was
the way we showed affection.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.189
Shame stance.

11:18.189 --> 11:20.493
They're clicking at you.

11:20.493 --> 11:21.530
Oh, okay.

11:21.530 --> 11:24.167
Shame stance. Sure.

11:24.167 --> 11:26.540
I, um--no, I got this.

11:26.540 --> 11:29.846
Uh... boom.

11:29.846 --> 11:32.685
Am I even close?
- Ugh, good enough.

11:32.685 --> 11:35.490
both: Shame. Shame. Shame.

11:35.591 --> 11:38.029
Shame. Shame. Shame.

11:38.029 --> 11:40.601
- Like I said, I love it here.
- Shame. Shame.

11:40.601 --> 11:43.472
Long story short,
Spade wants to eat me.

11:43.472 --> 11:44.609
So I've spent
the last two hours

11:44.609 --> 11:47.214
wandering the streets
yelling for a Jewish celebrity.

11:47.214 --> 11:48.550
Been there.

11:48.550 --> 11:49.819
So do you mind
if I crash here tonight

11:49.819 --> 11:51.455
until I find
a new A-list human?

11:51.455 --> 11:52.992
Sure, buddy. Come on in.

11:53.092 --> 11:55.396
We're in the middle
of our Christmas show.

11:55.396 --> 11:58.537
"The Shining: The Musical."

11:58.537 --> 12:00.608

a little stressed ♪

12:00.608 --> 12:02.077

12:22.852 --> 12:24.822
"Texas Chainsaw
Massa-Christmas."

12:24.822 --> 12:26.760
Would you look at that,
it's time for me

12:26.760 --> 12:30.801
to make up a lazy excuse
to leave.

12:34.374 --> 12:35.778
Cannon-bear!

12:35.778 --> 12:37.682
- Aah!
- Come on.

12:37.682 --> 12:39.619
Let's go eat
each other's vomit.

12:39.619 --> 12:41.957
Yeah, we did that already.
It's nap time.

12:41.957 --> 12:43.760
Just sleep
with your mouth open

12:43.760 --> 12:45.330
and I'll do the rest.

12:45.330 --> 12:48.837
- That's gross, even for me.
- Come on.

12:48.837 --> 12:51.610
I never get to do
fun stuff like this.

12:51.610 --> 12:53.479
Well, I never get to nap

12:53.479 --> 12:55.383
now that you like to do
fun stuff.

12:55.383 --> 12:56.653
You're fat.

12:56.653 --> 12:59.291
I'm going to go bite that lady.

13:01.395 --> 13:03.165
Whoa, whoa. Wait.

13:03.165 --> 13:05.370
That's Jill, our mom goddess.

13:05.370 --> 13:06.506
We love her.

13:06.506 --> 13:09.779
When did you get so mean?
What is wrong with you?

13:09.779 --> 13:12.117
I'm gonna go dig a hole
in the couch.

13:13.252 --> 13:15.891
Man, I thought I preferred
brain-damaged Honey,

13:15.891 --> 13:16.826
but I don't.

13:16.960 --> 13:20.366
I miss loving, patient,
doesn't finish her food,

13:20.366 --> 13:21.836
wet blanket Honey.

13:21.836 --> 13:25.009
Who can help me un-damage
her brain?

13:26.245 --> 13:29.284
Tchotchke, how do I assemble
Honey's boring friends?

13:39.438 --> 13:42.912
Okay, guys, this is gonna
be hard for you to see,

13:42.912 --> 13:44.682
but something has happened
to Honey.

13:44.682 --> 13:46.519
Honey!

13:46.519 --> 13:47.688
Yes, buttercup?

13:49.826 --> 13:51.730
Look, I broke Honey.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.533
- That's not Honey.
- Right?

13:53.533 --> 13:54.836
She's like a different dog.

13:54.836 --> 13:56.472
She is different dog.

13:56.472 --> 13:57.340
Yeah, I know.

13:57.340 --> 13:58.677
Get the pinecones
out of your ears.

13:58.677 --> 14:00.581
This is what I'm trying
to tell you.

14:00.581 --> 14:02.585
Hey, is your name Honey?

14:02.585 --> 14:04.856
Who the hell is Honey?

14:04.956 --> 14:07.661
Oh, my God, guys.
This isn't Honey.

14:07.661 --> 14:10.099
How were there no signs?

14:10.099 --> 14:13.707
For the last time,
my name is Lady Capulet.

14:13.707 --> 14:17.113
The vet mixed us up, duh.

14:17.113 --> 14:20.119
Boy, you're a master
of deception.

14:20.119 --> 14:22.157
And now poor Honey is stuck
at the vet.

14:22.157 --> 14:25.798
Where after going unclaimed

14:25.798 --> 14:30.473
she'll be put to sleep,
to death, forever!

14:30.473 --> 14:31.810
To death!

14:33.647 --> 14:35.617
Oh, my God.

14:35.617 --> 14:37.722
What do I do, Honey?

14:37.722 --> 14:39.992
Um, I don't know, baby cakes.

14:40.093 --> 14:42.130
Oh, right.

14:42.130 --> 14:44.067
Shame. Shame.

14:44.067 --> 14:46.138
Shame. Shame.
- Ugh, I get it.

14:46.138 --> 14:48.242
Shame
- Dogs, potty time.

14:49.478 --> 14:50.179
You know what's funny?

14:50.346 --> 14:52.217
At my old house,
I was the rule follower.

14:52.217 --> 14:54.187
And Chief was
the lovable screwball.

14:54.187 --> 14:56.626
Oh, if you know
what a vibrator is,

14:56.626 --> 14:57.928
you're gonna love this story.

14:57.928 --> 15:00.133
One time, Chie--
- Oh, my God.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.571
Are you initiating
a bowel movement?

15:02.571 --> 15:04.976
Uh, no.

15:04.976 --> 15:07.013
Why are you making
eye contact with us?

15:07.013 --> 15:09.017
I-I can't go
without eye contact.

15:09.017 --> 15:11.088
And what's the problem?
We're outside.

15:11.088 --> 15:13.794
We have a privacy shrub
for a reason.

15:13.794 --> 15:14.929
Just because you're a dog

15:14.929 --> 15:17.233
doesn't mean
you have to act like one.

15:17.233 --> 15:18.537
Ouch.

15:18.537 --> 15:20.173
You guys are pretentious snobs.

15:20.173 --> 15:23.145
And I thought I'd like that,
but guess what?

15:23.145 --> 15:23.947
I don't.

15:24.047 --> 15:25.951
I like dogs
who aren't judgmental

15:26.051 --> 15:28.088
and who show their owners affection.

15:28.088 --> 15:31.462
And who make eye contact
with me while I poop.

15:31.462 --> 15:34.301
Like Chief. I miss Chief.
And Jill.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.508
She's patient and she lets me
lick her anywhere.

15:37.508 --> 15:39.044
Ew.

15:39.044 --> 15:41.649
Oh, grow up.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.687
I miss my old life.

15:52.538 --> 15:53.573
Gasp! Epiphany!

15:53.673 --> 15:57.313
I've got to The Holiday
switcheroo back to my old life.

15:57.313 --> 16:00.687
I've got to find
that golden Buddha-Dog statue.

16:00.687 --> 16:02.958
Right after I finish.

16:02.958 --> 16:05.597
Buddy, you mind looking me
in the eye?

16:05.597 --> 16:07.066
Sure.

16:10.139 --> 16:12.912
- Thank you.
- No, thank you, doll.

16:20.861 --> 16:22.096
<i>Here's a fun question.</i>

16:22.096 --> 16:24.902
Now that Honey
is being put down,

16:24.902 --> 16:26.606
did everyone else
get what they wanted...

16:26.706 --> 16:28.008
for The Holidays?

16:28.008 --> 16:29.779
You're wrong, Uncle Nathan.

16:29.779 --> 16:31.114
Honey is still alive.

16:31.114 --> 16:32.818
And as much as I want to hear

16:32.818 --> 16:34.254
what everyone got
for The Holidays,

16:34.254 --> 16:36.391
I'm gonna save Honey
from the vet.

16:36.391 --> 16:37.862
I just need to eat
something I shouldn't

16:37.862 --> 16:40.233
so Jill will take me to the vet
to get my stomach pumped.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.707
But what? Everything in this
house has already passed

16:43.707 --> 16:45.009
through me at least once.

16:45.109 --> 16:47.848
Hey, who wants in
on this electric spaghetti?

16:47.848 --> 16:50.787
Gasp! Epipity!

16:55.029 --> 16:58.402
This is exactly why
you can't find a good man.

16:58.402 --> 17:00.607
♪ And not just 'cause
the elevators ♪

17:00.607 --> 17:02.611
♪ Overflow with blood ♪

17:02.611 --> 17:03.980
Okay, it is catchy.

17:05.383 --> 17:06.385
Spade?

17:06.385 --> 17:09.491
That dude is, like,
obsessed with eating me.

17:09.491 --> 17:11.395
Max! There you are.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.571
Wait, Max.
Hold on. Max!

17:18.309 --> 17:19.144
Max!

17:19.277 --> 17:22.751
No way, Spade,
you are not gonna eat me!

17:22.751 --> 17:24.555
Uh-uh!
- Where the hell did he go?

17:24.555 --> 17:26.391
<i>Maxie?</i>

17:31.201 --> 17:34.742
Move over, kid.
This pig's on the lam.

17:35.409 --> 17:37.815
Let's just keep our hands
and hooves above the blanket.

17:37.915 --> 17:39.317
I'm not into anything weird.

17:39.317 --> 17:41.589
Golden Buddha statue?

17:41.589 --> 17:43.359
Golden Buddha statue!

17:43.359 --> 17:46.398
Where are you,
golden Buddha statue?

17:46.398 --> 17:48.837
Max? Max!

17:48.837 --> 17:50.674
Aah!

17:54.615 --> 17:56.018
What do I do?

17:56.018 --> 17:58.823
Guess I could make this look
like a suicide?

17:58.823 --> 18:00.727
No, that's the old Spade.

18:00.727 --> 18:03.432
Let's get you to the vet.

18:10.681 --> 18:11.816
Aah!

18:14.822 --> 18:16.091
Watch out!

18:16.091 --> 18:17.594
Aah!

18:20.066 --> 18:23.138
It's okay. I'm David Spade.

18:23.138 --> 18:25.276
You guys, I need help.
Someone hit this poor dog.

18:25.276 --> 18:27.447
I'm pretty sure it was
Rob Schneider.

18:27.447 --> 18:30.787
Help! My dogs have
Human-Centipeded themselves.

18:30.787 --> 18:32.891
Can't you get anything right?

18:32.891 --> 18:35.998
Human Centipede
is mouth to tush.

18:35.998 --> 18:40.206
I am sorry
I'm not perfect, Mom!

18:40.206 --> 18:42.143
'Course I did it wrong.

18:42.143 --> 18:44.548
Well, I'll tell you what
you did wrong.

18:44.548 --> 18:45.984
The Holidays, huh?

18:54.669 --> 18:58.042
Golden Buddha-Dog.
I did it!

18:58.042 --> 19:00.781
Wait, did I?
- Honey?

19:00.781 --> 19:02.250
Chief?

19:02.250 --> 19:05.590
Honey?
Is it you?

19:05.691 --> 19:08.897
Or is that a different you
that I think is you

19:08.897 --> 19:10.132
but is not you?

19:10.132 --> 19:11.401
Oh, I've never been more glad

19:11.401 --> 19:13.773
to have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:13.773 --> 19:16.278
It is you.

19:16.278 --> 19:18.650
I'm so sorry
I ruined everything.

19:18.650 --> 19:19.919
No, I'm sorry.

19:19.919 --> 19:21.221
You were just trying to be you

19:21.221 --> 19:23.092
and I didn't think
I liked that.

19:23.092 --> 19:25.831
But I do. I love that!
And I love you.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.135
I love you, too, Honey.

19:28.135 --> 19:30.874
I love that you're kind, protective,

19:30.874 --> 19:32.043
smarter than me,

19:32.143 --> 19:34.381
and that you don't want
to eat my vomit.

19:34.381 --> 19:37.654
Because I learned something
that I think on some level,

19:37.654 --> 19:40.794
you've known all along--
it's gross.

19:40.794 --> 19:43.633
It is, Chief. It is.

19:46.038 --> 19:48.308
Oh, no! What do I do?

19:48.308 --> 19:50.680
I guess I could make this
look like a suicide.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.152
No, that's the old Max.

19:53.152 --> 19:55.022
<i>And it was only
once he ran away,</i>

19:55.022 --> 19:58.095
that I realized
how much he meant to me.

19:58.095 --> 19:59.999
And if I ever find that pig,
I'm telling you,

19:59.999 --> 20:01.536
I'll never put him
in my stomach.

20:01.536 --> 20:03.807
Because he's
already in my heart.

20:03.807 --> 20:05.677
Oh, Spade!

20:05.677 --> 20:06.913
Max!

20:09.350 --> 20:12.090
Hey, would you and your pig

20:12.190 --> 20:14.060
like to maybe join us
for dinner tonight?

20:14.060 --> 20:18.435
Well, I was supposed to host
a star-studded holiday bash

20:18.435 --> 20:20.774
with the cast
of "Young Sheldon,"

20:20.774 --> 20:21.876
but sure.

20:26.986 --> 20:30.159
You're funny. He's funny.

20:30.159 --> 20:32.163
You could do better.

20:32.163 --> 20:34.602
And then
the Buddha-Dog statue granted

20:34.602 --> 20:36.071
my magical The Holidays wish.

20:36.071 --> 20:37.875
And suddenly there you were.

20:37.875 --> 20:40.981
Well, I suppose there's
no other explanation.

20:40.981 --> 20:43.218
Aw, I'm so glad
you're home safe.

20:43.218 --> 20:45.189
Now that you're boring again,

20:45.189 --> 20:47.661
let's celebrate The Holidays

20:47.661 --> 20:52.003
with a nice, big,
wet, sloppy nap.

20:53.673 --> 20:54.675
I missed this.

20:54.842 --> 20:57.380
Oh, Honey, Honey.
Would you mind keeping it down?

21:00.520 --> 21:03.091
- I missed you.
- I missed you more.

21:03.091 --> 21:05.496
No, I missed you more.

21:05.496 --> 21:08.603
- Are you almost done?
- Ish.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.271
Okay. That's enough for now.

21:28.041 --> 21:29.444
Happy The Holidays, Chief.

21:29.444 --> 21:32.049
Aw, happy The Holidays, Honey.

21:34.020 --> 21:35.891
Bento.

21:37.026 --> 21:38.061
<i>That's nice, Jen and Gabby.</i>
