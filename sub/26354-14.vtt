00:21.580 --> 00:23.960
Okay. All done. Time for school.

00:23.985 --> 00:26.015
Tina, you're done? We
just started eating.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.975
Why do you want to
go to school so badly?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.125
Did you do your homework last night?

00:30.150 --> 00:31.401
Today's the day they're
announcing the theme

00:31.425 --> 00:32.885
for the eighth grade dance.

00:32.910 --> 00:36.025
And rumor has it
they might be choosing mine.

00:36.050 --> 00:37.510
I started that rumor.

00:37.535 --> 00:40.540
Oh, right. Your theme.
What was it again?

00:40.565 --> 00:41.752
"Night of the Living Dance."

00:41.788 --> 00:43.974
Everyone dresses up like
zombies who are ready to party.

00:43.999 --> 00:46.589
- Eatin' brains and doin' cocaine!
- Gene.

00:46.614 --> 00:47.947
I hope they choose my idea.

00:47.972 --> 00:49.482
It was inspired by a story I wrote.

00:49.507 --> 00:53.127
Ooh, one of your frisky,
friendly what's-it-calleds?

00:53.152 --> 00:55.119
Erotic friend s-stories.

00:55.144 --> 00:57.944
I read it. It was erotic
and highly disturbing.

00:57.969 --> 00:59.783
- Two for two.
- No, it wasn't.

00:59.808 --> 01:01.850
I'm at the dance in my
dress that's ripped up

01:01.875 --> 01:03.181
and covered in brains.

01:03.205 --> 01:04.834
And Zombie Jimmy Jr. Asks me to dance.

01:04.860 --> 01:06.400
And then I fall but catch myself

01:06.425 --> 01:07.335
by grabbing onto his butt,

01:07.360 --> 01:08.447
- and then we...
- Okay, the end.

01:08.472 --> 01:10.549
But I didn't get to the part
where his butt falls off and...

01:10.574 --> 01:13.034
I... want to remain in suspense.

01:13.059 --> 01:15.369
So you and Jimmy Jr. Are
going to the dance together?

01:15.394 --> 01:17.024
Yeah. I mean, he hasn't asked me yet,

01:17.049 --> 01:18.759
but we talked about it a while ago.

01:18.784 --> 01:20.624
I gave him some ideas of how to ask.

01:20.649 --> 01:22.739
A lot of people have been
going the promposal route.

01:22.764 --> 01:25.275
Not that this is prom, but
it's still a big D. Deal.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.550
Don't say "big D."

01:26.575 --> 01:28.495
I told him no pressure,
just do something simple.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.930
Like take me into a grocery store,

01:29.955 --> 01:31.369
and all the oranges spell out

01:31.394 --> 01:33.030
"Orange you glad you're
going to the dance with me?"

01:33.055 --> 01:35.515
Or he could sky-write it in the sky.

01:35.540 --> 01:37.994
I need someone to sky-write
these eggs into my mouth.

01:38.028 --> 01:40.608
- Here comes the airplane. Ah!
- Ah!

01:41.614 --> 01:44.003
Hey, Dad, what are you wearing
to Mom and Gene's wedding?

01:44.028 --> 01:45.745
Uh, a suit, I guess.

01:45.770 --> 01:48.284
Good morning, Wagstaff.

01:48.309 --> 01:51.573
Before we get started
with normal announcements,

01:51.598 --> 01:54.729
Mr. Frond has something to say.

01:54.754 --> 01:57.862
The theme for the
eighth grade dance is...

01:57.887 --> 02:02.403
"Night of the Living Dance"!
Suggested by Tina Belcher!

02:02.428 --> 02:04.168
- They chose my theme.
- Ew.

02:04.193 --> 02:06.784
This day can't get
any better. Or can it?

02:06.809 --> 02:10.112
Hey, Jimmy Jr., is there
something you want to ask me?

02:10.137 --> 02:13.105
Oh. Uh... can I get a restroom pass?

02:13.130 --> 02:16.550
Huh. Probably off to arrange
the flash mob, I'm guessing?

02:16.879 --> 02:20.590
Hey, guys. So you probably
heard that my theme was chosen

02:20.615 --> 02:22.129
for the eighth grade dance.

02:22.154 --> 02:24.574
What? Sorry, I stopped
listening after "Hey, guys."

02:24.599 --> 02:26.131
Well, truthfully, after "Hey."

02:26.156 --> 02:28.706
So, the dance committee
meets after school...

02:28.731 --> 02:30.941
Uh, if you're doing dance
committee after school,

02:30.966 --> 02:32.686
who's gonna cover for
you at the restaurant?

02:32.820 --> 02:34.740
My incredibly supportive
sister and brother?

02:34.900 --> 02:35.770
They sound nice.

02:35.900 --> 02:38.070
You guys, please? It's my theme.

02:38.150 --> 02:39.400
Fine, we'll cover for you.

02:39.553 --> 02:41.957
- But you've got to do something for us.
- Okay.

02:41.982 --> 02:44.410
Every day this week, when you
get home from dance committee,

02:44.450 --> 02:48.160
you have to... clean
the restaurant bathroom.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.960
- Oh. That's where the toilet is.
- Yeah.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.250
But we take turns.

02:53.330 --> 02:55.250
If you want to be on the committee,

02:55.340 --> 02:56.840
it's not gonna be pretty.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.720
Okay. Fine. It's a deal. Hey, Jimmy Jr.

02:59.745 --> 03:01.775
Over here! Should I, uh, clear a space?

03:01.800 --> 03:03.680
What do you need to
do your big, uh, thing?

03:03.705 --> 03:07.467
Uh, sorry, I got to, um,
check out the hallway.

03:07.492 --> 03:09.492
Oh, okay. Let me know how it is.

03:11.485 --> 03:12.535
Hi, guys.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.650
Aw, Gretchen, why so droopy?

03:14.690 --> 03:15.875
I'm not wearing a bra.

03:15.900 --> 03:18.280
No, I'm talking about your frowny face.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.675
My sister's getting married on Saturday.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.000
Oh, congrats.

03:22.025 --> 03:24.295
My family told me, if
I want to bring a date,

03:24.320 --> 03:26.030
I got to bring a nice guy.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.950
I guess the guys I've
been bringing to stuff

03:27.975 --> 03:31.015
have been "disasters"
who "drink too much"

03:31.040 --> 03:33.250
and "vomit" on my mom's "workout tapes."

03:33.290 --> 03:34.231
- Hmm.
- Huh.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.435
If I knew any nice
idiots, I would bring one.

03:36.460 --> 03:38.040
Hey, wait. What about you?

03:38.130 --> 03:39.050
What's your name again?

03:39.130 --> 03:40.840
Teddy. We've met so many times.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.310
Well, you seem nice. And you're there.

03:43.380 --> 03:46.076
- Do you want to go with me?
- I'm flattered, Gretchen, but I can't.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.270
I'm going away this weekend.

03:47.335 --> 03:49.535
I'm taking my mom to see Digereedudes,

03:49.560 --> 03:52.180
the Australian all-male
revue at Sun Woods Casino.

03:52.270 --> 03:54.140
I assume it's some kind of animal show.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.575
Ticket says "Watch out
for swinging dingoes."

03:56.600 --> 03:58.746
I'm never gonna find
a date by this weekend.

03:58.771 --> 04:01.630
- Yes, you will, Gretchen. I'll help you.
- You will?

04:01.655 --> 04:04.026
Yeah! What if we go on
one of those dating sites?

04:04.051 --> 04:05.925
Okay. This could be fun.

04:05.950 --> 04:08.651
-Yeah. -I-I better get
everything waxed and ready.

04:08.676 --> 04:10.016
What do you think, Bob,
bikini or Brazilian?

04:10.040 --> 04:11.830
Or barbarian? That's where you let it

04:11.855 --> 04:13.405
get crazy down there.

04:13.430 --> 04:15.785
- Uh, surprise us?
- Okay, I'll surprise you.

04:17.380 --> 04:20.300
-Hey, Tina, uh, can I talk to you?
-Oh, my God. This is it.

04:20.380 --> 04:22.920
-W... Uh, well...
-If my glasses fog up, don't be alarmed.

04:22.970 --> 04:24.180
It's just 'cause I'm excited.

04:24.220 --> 04:27.050
Tina, can we maybe, uh,
go somewhere private?

04:27.090 --> 04:29.540
But, if we go somewhere
private, who's gonna go "Aw"

04:29.565 --> 04:32.070
and applaud for us after
you-you ask me to the dance?

04:32.140 --> 04:34.060
- I'm...
- You are going to ask me, right?

04:34.140 --> 04:37.690
Um... no. I-I'm not going to the dance.

04:37.715 --> 04:40.400
-You're what?!
-It's not that big a deal, is it?

04:40.425 --> 04:43.005
Aah! Oh, my God! Aah!

04:43.030 --> 04:44.440
Whoa, she just kicked a kid!

04:44.481 --> 04:47.604
Oh, no-no-no, she just
tripped. Looked like it, though.

04:52.870 --> 04:54.910
Stupid Jimmy... J... Aah!

04:56.250 --> 04:57.670
Jimmy... Aah!

04:59.880 --> 05:01.130
Aah! Oh! Oh, my God.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.300
Are you okay?

05:02.420 --> 05:04.830
Sorry, I didn't see you.

05:04.855 --> 05:08.735
I... Oh... It's just
this boy, Jimmy Jr.,

05:08.760 --> 05:10.196
changed his mind and
decided not to ask me

05:10.220 --> 05:11.735
to the eighth grade dance.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.140
And-and we talked about it.
He said he was gonna ask me.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.900
Ah! It's so messed up.

05:15.925 --> 05:17.890
Exactly. You get it.

05:18.705 --> 05:20.665
Sorry. I just realized I'm
totally venting at you.

05:20.690 --> 05:22.940
You're pretty easy to talk to, though.

05:23.070 --> 05:25.360
This is the best conversation
I've had in a long time.

05:25.987 --> 05:27.674
If this is the best
conversation you've had,

05:27.740 --> 05:31.200
then honk on the count of
three: one, two, three...

05:31.280 --> 05:34.265
Four. Five. Six.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.450
I knew it.

05:36.790 --> 05:39.312
There are some nice-looking
guys on PerfectPair.

05:39.337 --> 05:40.265
Look at this one.

05:40.290 --> 05:43.297
Software engineer? Talk to me
when you're a hardware engineer.

05:43.322 --> 05:44.324
Mm.

05:44.349 --> 05:45.187
How about this one?

05:45.212 --> 05:47.373
Is he in a tank top
with the nipples cut out?

05:47.398 --> 05:50.260
Yeah. It says "Pepperonis, anyone?" Ha!

05:50.300 --> 05:51.985
- What app is that?
- FunBuddy.

05:52.010 --> 05:55.310
Gretchen, you're not gonna find
a nice wedding date on FunBuddy.

05:55.430 --> 05:57.365
But the guys you're
picking out look boring.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.730
Lin, your guy does look a little boring.

05:59.755 --> 06:02.765
I mean, it says his interests
are reading and naps.

06:02.790 --> 06:05.335
So? I like those, too. Except the reading.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.295
Hey, kids. Where's Tina?

06:07.320 --> 06:09.740
Oh, she's at dance committee.
Her theme got picked.

06:09.860 --> 06:11.700
We're covering for her,
so don't expect things

06:11.725 --> 06:13.965
- to get done that quickly.
- Or that well.

06:13.990 --> 06:16.080
It's nice of you guys
to cover for your sister

06:16.105 --> 06:17.765
so she can do the dance committee.

06:17.790 --> 06:20.580
A little too nice. What did
you make her promise to do?

06:20.605 --> 06:22.315
Father, how dare you?

06:22.340 --> 06:24.680
We did this out of the
kindness of our hearts.

06:24.705 --> 06:26.606
And also, she's gonna
clean the bathroom all week.

06:26.630 --> 06:28.065
She insisted on that.

06:28.090 --> 06:30.340
Speaking of bathrooms, look at this guy.

06:30.365 --> 06:31.905
- Is he on the toilet?
- Yeah.

06:31.930 --> 06:33.510
He's being funny. I think.

06:33.535 --> 06:35.785
- I'm gonna send him a message.
- Gretchen, no!

06:35.915 --> 06:38.115
And that's why I think we
should send all boys to Canada

06:38.140 --> 06:40.230
and call it Manada. And never go there.

06:40.310 --> 06:42.810
Well, it's getting late. I'd better go.

06:42.835 --> 06:45.375
Nice meeting you. Guess
I'll see you around.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.900
Oh, you're following me.

06:46.980 --> 06:48.295
I think he likes you.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.740
- Huh?
- That's Bruce. Bruce the Goose.

06:50.860 --> 06:53.490
He didn't seem to mind your
long story about a dance

06:53.570 --> 06:56.200
that you told really
loudly for some reason.

06:56.330 --> 06:57.330
Oh, sorry.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.330
Geese can be kind of clingy.

06:59.410 --> 07:02.123
They can form strong
attachments to other birds

07:02.148 --> 07:04.250
- and sometimes to people.
- Like me?

07:04.340 --> 07:06.395
Seems like it, huh? I tried to get him

07:06.420 --> 07:08.300
to attach to me, but it didn't take.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.395
Guess I wasn't sad and desperate enough.

07:10.420 --> 07:12.735
Aw, Bruce. You're a caring guy.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.640
Some people could learn
a thing or two from you.

07:14.665 --> 07:16.455
You're talking about Jimmy Jr.?

07:16.480 --> 07:18.155
Yes! Ah... such a jerk.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.627
Yeah, yeah, no, no, I heard, I heard.

07:20.652 --> 07:21.772
Such a jerk.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.734
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.

07:24.759 --> 07:26.996
Dan Esposito shaved "Will
you go to the dance with me?"

07:27.020 --> 07:28.400
into the back of his head.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.230
Ronald McEvoy wrote "Will
you go to the dance with me?"

07:31.255 --> 07:33.013
with worms in science class.

07:33.038 --> 07:35.215
He taught the worms how to spell.

07:36.700 --> 07:37.580
Would you make me the
happiest eighth grader

07:37.700 --> 07:39.290
and be my date to the dance?

07:39.370 --> 07:41.580
Oh, my God. Yes! What's your name?

07:41.660 --> 07:43.290
Hey, Tina.

07:43.370 --> 07:45.080
Can, uh, we talk for a sec?

07:45.130 --> 07:46.316
Is it about how you changed your mind

07:46.340 --> 07:47.606
and want to ask me to the dance?

07:47.630 --> 07:51.240
No, sorry. But I do
want to talk to you more,

07:51.265 --> 07:53.065
'cause you seemed so mad yesterday.

07:53.090 --> 07:55.140
Or maybe you're over it?

07:55.260 --> 07:56.906
Tina, the dance committee
meeting is starting soon.

07:56.930 --> 07:58.760
We've got a lot of work
to do for the dance.

07:58.785 --> 08:00.723
The dance... the dance... the dance.

08:02.012 --> 08:03.400
Aah!

08:03.480 --> 08:06.150
So, yeah, I ditched dance
committee and came right here.

08:06.230 --> 08:07.705
I'm just so sick of people.

08:07.730 --> 08:09.730
That's what's so great about you.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.006
Hey, I brought half a turkey sandwich.

08:11.030 --> 08:12.910
Oh. Unless that's weird
for you 'cause you're...

08:12.990 --> 08:14.966
Oh. You're eating it right out of my hand.

08:14.990 --> 08:18.810
Okay, Gretchen, your date's
gonna be here any minute.

08:18.835 --> 08:20.675
His name's Norman,
and he's a podiatrist.

08:20.805 --> 08:22.935
That's him. He's cute, sorta.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.010
He looks like if a banana were a person.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.580
- Uh, are you...
- Hi. I'm Gretchen.

08:28.605 --> 08:30.565
I'm Norman. Pleased to meet you.

08:30.590 --> 08:33.760
These are our menus, and, uh,
if you don't mind me saying,

08:33.799 --> 08:35.220
you two make a lovely couple.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.890
Oh, uh, well, we just met.

08:36.970 --> 08:39.220
- What? Are you kidding me?
- Uh...

08:39.245 --> 08:41.755
Well, I'll just give you a
minute to look over the menus,

08:41.780 --> 08:43.970
and whatever else you want to look over.

08:43.995 --> 08:47.125
So, you work with feet?
That's gross, right?

08:47.150 --> 08:49.020
Uh, I find the foot fascinating.

08:49.045 --> 08:50.795
Look at the sparks fly.

08:50.820 --> 08:53.375
Uh, I don't want to be
hearing or watching this.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.150
You know, you're not gonna believe this,

08:55.240 --> 08:57.616
but my foot's actually a urologist.

08:57.641 --> 08:59.095
- Oh! Ooh!
- Mm-hmm.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.015
-Oh-oh! -Uh, are you
guys ready to order?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.300
Ow!

09:02.330 --> 09:04.305
I'll have a... a Burger of the Day.

09:04.330 --> 09:05.660
- Make it two.
- You got it.

09:05.790 --> 09:07.146
Pump the brakes, Gretchen.

09:07.170 --> 09:10.000
I'm trying to pump the brakes, Linda.

09:10.130 --> 09:12.210
It started to go a little
off the rails over there,

09:12.235 --> 09:13.775
but I got it back on track.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.470
Gretchen's pretending to
spill mustard on her boobs.

09:16.495 --> 09:18.115
Oh, how did that get there?

09:18.140 --> 09:20.125
Oh, God, oh, no. I'll be right back.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.866
And then this duck walked by

09:22.890 --> 09:24.996
and dropped a piece of bread,
and we tried not to laugh,

09:25.020 --> 09:27.520
but it was so hard not to,
'cause it was so embarrassing.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.730
Wait, you were at the park?

09:28.850 --> 09:30.490
I thought you were at
the dance committee.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.270
Yeah, and also there's
a disgusting bathroom

09:33.400 --> 09:35.665
that didn't get cleaned
because someone didn't get back

09:35.690 --> 09:37.280
until after closing time.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.530
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

09:38.610 --> 09:40.350
And also, I quit dance committee.

09:40.375 --> 09:41.925
I'm not going to the dance anymore.

09:41.950 --> 09:44.787
What? But you were so excited
about your zombie dance.

09:44.812 --> 09:45.805
And Jimmy Jr.

09:45.830 --> 09:47.953
Jimmy Jr. doesn't want to go
to the dance with me, okay?

09:47.978 --> 09:49.355
Okay.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.194
Wait. Tina,
who were you with at the park again?

09:52.219 --> 09:54.840
-A goose?
-No, Bob. She wasn't with a goose.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.300
It was a kid named Goose, right?

09:56.340 --> 09:57.550
No, he's a goose named Bruce.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.359
Wait, like, honk, honk.
Like that kind of goose?

10:00.384 --> 10:02.295
There's no kind of goose
that sounds like that.

10:02.390 --> 10:05.430
Don't geese kind of go, like...

10:05.560 --> 10:08.180
- No, like this. Honk, honk.
- Like a tow truck.

10:08.230 --> 10:09.390
Like a car.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.036
Stop it! Stop it! He
doesn't sound like that.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.730
He has a perfectly normal honk.

10:12.770 --> 10:15.046
You know what? I'm gonna have
the rest of my dinner in my room.

10:15.070 --> 10:16.150
And I'm gonna have the rest

10:16.190 --> 10:18.060
of Dad's dinner in my room.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.098
♪ ♪

10:37.550 --> 10:39.540
Okay, Gretchen. You had some lunches,

10:39.565 --> 10:41.025
you met some nice guys.

10:41.050 --> 10:42.510
Which one of these eligible bachelors

10:42.600 --> 10:43.900
is gonna be your matchelor?

10:43.970 --> 10:45.720
I don't know. They're all so boring.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.745
So much talking, so much khaki.

10:47.770 --> 10:50.432
I really like the guy
who works at the airport.

10:50.457 --> 10:51.575
He had a friendly face.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.630
-But too much baggage. Am I right?
-Yeah!

10:54.655 --> 10:56.705
Send him a message.
See if he wants to go.

10:56.730 --> 10:58.680
Nah, I don't wanna.

10:58.705 --> 11:02.085
Excuse me. There's no toilet
paper in your bathroom,

11:02.110 --> 11:03.900
and it's nasty in there.

11:03.925 --> 11:06.925
Oh, no, uh, sorry about that.
We'll-we'll clean it right away.

11:07.005 --> 11:08.345
Oh, my God.

11:08.370 --> 11:10.690
Have you guys cleaned the
bathroom at all this week?

11:10.715 --> 11:13.055
Tina's the one on
bathroom duty, remember?

11:13.080 --> 11:15.740
Yeah! It's not our fault she's
hanging out with Goosey Lawless

11:15.765 --> 11:17.355
instead of doing her duty!

11:17.380 --> 11:18.830
Well, someone needs to clean it.

11:18.855 --> 11:20.525
And that someone is you two.

11:20.550 --> 11:22.120
Mom and Gretchen, he's talking to you.

11:22.145 --> 11:24.025
No, you two. Now.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.830
Oh, smell no.

11:25.855 --> 11:26.735
I'm not ready for this!

11:26.760 --> 11:28.770
I'm just a boy!

11:29.316 --> 11:30.745
Oh, that's good.

11:30.770 --> 11:33.270
Tina, we just want to remind
you that we're still furious

11:33.295 --> 11:35.705
that we had to clean the
bathroom 'cause you were late.

11:35.730 --> 11:38.310
You goose-goose-ducked us over, lady.

11:38.335 --> 11:39.710
Guys, I'm sorry I have a life.

11:39.735 --> 11:40.665
With Bruce.

11:40.690 --> 11:42.150
Tina, what's with you lately?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.820
You're ditching work to go to the pond.

11:43.910 --> 11:45.450
You eat all your meals in your room.

11:45.530 --> 11:46.620
And...

11:46.660 --> 11:48.096
are you even listening to me right now?

11:48.120 --> 11:49.610
Hello? Hello?

11:49.635 --> 11:51.595
I can't believe I'm saying this,

11:51.620 --> 11:53.330
but I kind of miss the old days,

11:53.420 --> 11:56.240
when you would ramble on and
on about the zombie dance.

11:56.265 --> 11:58.773
You guys talking about the big dance?

11:58.798 --> 12:00.508
Did you change your mind, Tina?

12:00.533 --> 12:02.243
No! God, I told you, I'm not going

12:02.268 --> 12:04.574
to the stupid dance, okay?!
Everyone at school is annoying.

12:04.598 --> 12:05.954
I don't want to be
around them. I don't want

12:05.978 --> 12:07.648
to be around anyone! Except Bruce.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.228
I'm gonna go pee. Angrily.

12:09.253 --> 12:11.543
Whoa. What's going on?

12:11.568 --> 12:14.898
Uh, guys, you might want
to take a peek at this.

12:14.988 --> 12:17.213
"Tina and Bruce
shared a love so deep... "

12:17.238 --> 12:19.044
That it didn't matter
that she was a person

12:19.068 --> 12:20.408
and he was a goose.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.618
No one understood their love.

12:21.698 --> 12:23.448
So they ran away
together and laid dozens

12:23.498 --> 12:25.218
and dozens of eggs and
had dozens and dozens

12:25.243 --> 12:27.743
of babies who looked like
little amazing goose people.

12:27.768 --> 12:29.038
- Oh, God.
- Hot.

12:29.168 --> 12:31.128
- Gene.
- What's happening to Tina?

12:31.248 --> 12:32.628
It's like she got her heart hurt

12:32.813 --> 12:34.273
and now she's shutting out the world.

12:34.298 --> 12:36.128
She's becoming a Bruce recluse.

12:36.168 --> 12:37.798
You know, before this goose came along,

12:37.928 --> 12:39.733
dancing at a zombie dance with Jimmy Jr.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.048
Was her big fantasy.

12:41.138 --> 12:43.308
Maybe we need to get her back onto that.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.728
Okay. How do we get her to the dance?

12:45.808 --> 12:48.268
-Gene and Louise are gonna get her there.
-We are?

12:48.308 --> 12:50.558
Yeah. Unless you want to
keep cleaning the bathroom.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.478
Don't remind me. I can still taste it.

12:52.503 --> 12:53.793
- What?
- What?

12:53.818 --> 12:55.544
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing!

12:55.568 --> 12:57.608
No one's concerned
about your future hybrid

12:57.633 --> 12:59.173
human-goose babies,

12:59.198 --> 13:00.778
and no one read your journal either,

13:00.803 --> 13:02.633
so just chill out!

13:05.890 --> 13:08.788
So, wait, Tina is
hanging out with a goose?

13:08.868 --> 13:10.208
Named Bruce.

13:10.233 --> 13:12.573
So that's why Tina's not
talking to me anymore?

13:12.598 --> 13:14.774
Tina's not talking to you
because you didn't ask her

13:14.798 --> 13:17.127
to the dance like you said you would.

13:17.128 --> 13:18.588
You crushed her heart.

13:18.628 --> 13:19.798
I know.

13:19.823 --> 13:22.703
So go to the dance and
fix this cluster-fart!

13:22.728 --> 13:24.823
- But I can't, Louise!
- Why?!

13:24.848 --> 13:26.928
I have an injury.

13:27.018 --> 13:29.438
- What?
- It's embarrassing.

13:29.478 --> 13:31.728
- Why?
- Because of where it is.

13:31.753 --> 13:33.198
Where is it?!

13:33.223 --> 13:35.203
- My butt!
- Your butt.

13:35.228 --> 13:38.608
I was doing the dance from
the movie Save the Last Dance,

13:38.698 --> 13:40.098
and I got really lost in the moment.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.963
And I guess I...

13:41.988 --> 13:43.118
pulled a butt muscle.

13:44.763 --> 13:47.133
I was too embarrassed to
tell Tina what happened.

13:47.158 --> 13:49.408
And I can't really dance until it heals.

13:49.433 --> 13:51.143
I can barely do this.

13:51.168 --> 13:54.418
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Stop. Stop it. Stop. Just...

13:54.458 --> 13:56.273
Here's what you're
gonna do. Go to the dance

13:56.298 --> 13:59.258
and do that weird swaying
thing and look happy.

13:59.283 --> 14:01.563
Like this? Ow...

14:01.588 --> 14:02.798
Nailing it.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.008
Hey, Lin? We're out of tomatoes.

14:05.098 --> 14:07.114
-Can you grab some more from downstairs?
-In a minute, Bob.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.518
I'm just logging onto Gretchen's
account on PerfectPair.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.598
Oh. Does she know you're doing that?

14:11.728 --> 14:14.728
No. But I have her password
because I set up her account.

14:14.768 --> 14:17.084
I'm gonna message that airport
guy and see if he wants to go

14:17.108 --> 14:18.938
- with her to the wedding.
- Uh, that sounds

14:18.963 --> 14:21.473
- like a really bad idea.
- I know. It's smart, right?

14:21.498 --> 14:22.974
And I think I can maybe change his mind.

14:22.999 --> 14:25.593
Lin, don't do this.
Gretchen's not gonna like it.

14:25.618 --> 14:27.198
- I already did it.
- Well, undo it.

14:27.288 --> 14:29.093
No. There's no undo, Bob. It's done.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.118
- Oh, wait. It didn't go through.
- Oh. Good.

14:31.208 --> 14:32.958
- Oh, now it did.
- Oh, my God.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.128
Okay, so, first we find the goose,

14:35.153 --> 14:36.759
then we lure him away,
and then we trap him.

14:36.798 --> 14:38.308
And, hopefully, our very impressive

14:38.333 --> 14:40.123
stalling Tina tactic worked.

14:40.148 --> 14:41.654
There was a note taped to my locker

14:41.678 --> 14:43.064
that I had a very important phone call?

14:43.088 --> 14:45.138
I don't think so. The only
call that came in today

14:45.163 --> 14:48.323
was a prank phone call
about E. coli in the lettuce.

14:48.348 --> 14:51.727
Everyone knows that's not a real thing.

14:51.752 --> 14:53.533
Dangerous salad.

14:53.558 --> 14:54.768
So where's Bruce?

14:54.858 --> 14:56.778
All I see is a bunch of dumb ducks.

14:56.898 --> 14:58.068
Look, a goose.

14:58.093 --> 14:59.874
And it has a friendship
bracelet on its leg.

14:59.898 --> 15:00.898
It must be him.

15:00.923 --> 15:02.583
Come on, boy. Come on.

15:02.738 --> 15:04.713
Ha!

15:04.738 --> 15:06.868
Sit tight. We'll come
get you after the dance.

15:06.988 --> 15:08.868
If anyone asks, you're camping.

15:10.578 --> 15:12.828
Bruce?! Bruce?!

15:12.908 --> 15:14.998
- Tina!
- Look who it is.

15:15.078 --> 15:17.168
Hi, guys. What-what are you doing here?

15:17.248 --> 15:18.788
Oh, we're not allowed to enjoy

15:18.918 --> 15:20.918
a leisurely stroll around the park?

15:21.008 --> 15:24.178
Okay. Um, well, you haven't
seen Bruce, have you?

15:24.218 --> 15:25.498
He usually comes right up to me.

15:25.523 --> 15:26.968
He's got to be here somewhere.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.438
Maybe I should speak his language.

15:28.468 --> 15:31.388
- Honk! Honk, honk! Honk!
- Hi. Hello.

15:31.478 --> 15:33.244
- That's our sister.
- Honk, honk, honk, honk!

15:33.268 --> 15:36.413
She'd better not be
saying stuff about us.

15:37.180 --> 15:38.228
Hey, Gretch.

15:38.358 --> 15:41.108
Oh, hi, Lin. I got a
message from the airport guy

15:41.148 --> 15:42.868
that he's gonna come
with me to the wedding.

15:42.898 --> 15:45.068
He said he "liked my last message."

15:45.093 --> 15:46.593
- Oh, boy.
- Oh!

15:46.618 --> 15:48.378
That's great news!

15:48.403 --> 15:50.633
You logged in as me and
wrote that guy, didn't you?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.408
Okay. Yes, I did.

15:52.433 --> 15:54.593
But it was a good thing,
because now you have a date.

15:54.618 --> 15:56.168
Do you have an MBA, Linda?

15:56.193 --> 15:57.823
'Cause you're all up in my business.

15:57.848 --> 16:00.538
Gretchen, you might want
to find a nice guy for real.

16:00.563 --> 16:02.063
You know, for keeps.

16:02.088 --> 16:04.718
How about this? Goodbye for keeps!

16:04.743 --> 16:07.613
Until you need a haircut or a dye job!

16:07.638 --> 16:10.283
But I'm not gonna give
you my friends discount,

16:10.308 --> 16:12.538
because we're not friends anymore!

16:12.563 --> 16:14.863
- Oh, Gretchen, come on!
- You're the worst!

16:14.888 --> 16:16.598
- Oh, get a...
- You're the worst!

16:16.728 --> 16:18.533
Gretchen, get away from the window!

16:18.558 --> 16:19.898
Don't you throw that, Gretchen!

16:19.923 --> 16:21.953
I'm... I'll do it, I swear!

16:21.978 --> 16:23.688
Calm down, Gretchen!

16:23.713 --> 16:25.633
Don't make us call the cops, Gretchen!

16:25.658 --> 16:28.133
- Go ahead! Call them! Attica!
- Huh!

16:28.158 --> 16:29.906
You try to help someone,
and this is what you get.

16:29.931 --> 16:30.714
Attica! Attica!

16:30.738 --> 16:32.554
-Attica!
-Lin, Gretchen is really scary right now,

16:32.578 --> 16:34.936
but you also kind of
pushed her to this point.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.133
- What?
- Attica!

16:36.158 --> 16:36.880
Attica! Don't eat here!

16:36.905 --> 16:38.354
Well, your help was
trying to make Gretchen

16:38.378 --> 16:40.218
- not act like Gretchen.
- Don't eat here!

16:40.243 --> 16:41.801
Kind of like what her
family is asking her to do.

16:41.826 --> 16:42.474
Hey, don't eat here!

16:42.498 --> 16:44.484
- Oh, no. Bob, maybe you're right.
- Don't eat here. Don't eat here!

16:44.508 --> 16:46.298
- I just wanted her to be happy.
- Attica!

16:46.338 --> 16:47.654
- Attica!
- I mean, she was happy,

16:47.678 --> 16:49.638
and now she wants to
break our restaurant.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.298
Oh, thank God. She's walking away.

16:51.323 --> 16:53.153
That was terrifying.

16:53.178 --> 16:56.138
Bruce? Bruce?

16:56.163 --> 16:58.938
Where is he? Guess he's gone.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.728
Sorry, T. Hey, you know
what'll cheer you up?

17:01.818 --> 17:03.658
The Night of the Living Dance.

17:03.728 --> 17:05.318
Come on, let's get you there.

17:05.397 --> 17:07.147
Fine. Whatever. I don't care.

17:07.173 --> 17:08.792
Thattagirl.

17:17.256 --> 17:19.126
♪ ♪

17:21.627 --> 17:24.167
Wow, even Frond put on zombie makeup.

17:24.298 --> 17:25.667
- No, I didn't.
- Oh.

17:25.798 --> 17:27.627
- You're gonna be fine.
- Oh, look, Tina.

17:27.653 --> 17:30.178
There's Jimmy Jr. Looking pretty dapper

17:30.203 --> 17:31.693
for an undead guy, huh?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.678
Hi, Tina. I just want to say,

17:33.703 --> 17:35.963
I, um... I didn't ask you to the dance

17:35.988 --> 17:38.363
because I was too
embarrassed to tell you.

17:38.388 --> 17:41.203
I pulled my butt muscle
doing a very difficult move

17:41.228 --> 17:42.919
from Save the Last Dance.

17:42.944 --> 17:45.043
There. I said it.

17:45.068 --> 17:47.904
It feels good not to hide
my butt stuff anymore.

17:47.929 --> 17:50.424
This is bad. Jimmy
Jr. is talking about his butt,

17:50.448 --> 17:53.318
and Tina's too busy being
on Planet Goose to notice.

17:53.343 --> 17:55.133
Anyway, I can't really dance,

17:55.158 --> 17:56.923
but I'd like to try.

17:56.948 --> 17:58.158
With you.

17:58.183 --> 17:59.853
Gene, help me make her dance.

17:59.878 --> 18:02.958
Ow. Ow. Ow.

18:02.983 --> 18:04.783
Ow.

18:04.808 --> 18:06.338
- - Oh, my God!
- What the...

18:06.458 --> 18:07.644
Bruce!

18:07.668 --> 18:09.048
Goose on the loose!

18:10.298 --> 18:12.678
- Get out of here!
- Don't!

18:12.703 --> 18:14.993
You're scaring him!

18:15.018 --> 18:16.333
Oh, no! He's stuck!

18:16.388 --> 18:18.178
That goose is hooked!

18:20.591 --> 18:23.408
He's stuck! My friendship
bracelet is hooked on something.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.163
Why the heck is there a goose in here?

18:25.188 --> 18:27.438
If you have to ask,
then you don't get it.

18:27.463 --> 18:30.003
- I-I'm-I'm gonna call Animal Control.
- What? No!

18:30.028 --> 18:32.793
Yes. No goose is gonna ruin
a dance I'm chaperoning.

18:32.818 --> 18:34.278
But what-what'll happen to Bruce?

18:34.368 --> 18:35.448
I don't know, Tina.

18:35.528 --> 18:37.499
I didn't go to Animal Control School.

18:37.524 --> 18:40.654
I went to Harvard... ton
Community College.

18:44.748 --> 18:46.088
Hey, Gretchen.

18:46.168 --> 18:47.684
This is the one I was telling you about.

18:47.708 --> 18:49.878
- Mm-hmm.
- Gretchen, listen...

18:49.903 --> 18:52.523
I can't hear you. I'm blow-drying!

18:52.548 --> 18:54.364
I'm gonna say it anyway!

18:54.388 --> 18:56.798
I'm sorry I tried to make
you into someone you're not.

18:56.848 --> 18:58.944
It's just 'cause I love you
and I want you to be happy.

18:58.968 --> 19:01.058
But I realized you're
happy the way you are.

19:01.083 --> 19:03.413
And... I have the perfect
wedding date for you.

19:03.438 --> 19:04.898
Oh, yeah? Who?

19:05.018 --> 19:06.518
- Me.
- You?

19:06.543 --> 19:08.583
Yeah! I'm nice but I'm not boring.

19:08.608 --> 19:10.028
And I-I like to drink.

19:10.068 --> 19:11.278
- A lot.
- Mm-hmm.

19:11.303 --> 19:13.199
Will you let me take you
to your sister's wedding?

19:13.278 --> 19:14.608
Mm... Okay!

19:14.698 --> 19:15.698
All right!

19:15.778 --> 19:16.698
Should we get a limo?

19:16.723 --> 19:17.753
Yeah, let's get a limo!

19:17.778 --> 19:19.488
Let's get a limo!

19:19.618 --> 19:21.998
Animal Control will be here shortly.

19:22.038 --> 19:24.014
Bruce, I'm gonna climb up the
bleachers and get you down!

19:24.039 --> 19:26.289
Oh, no, you are not! I'm
not adding a broken neck

19:26.314 --> 19:27.933
to my list of problems tonight.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.157
First, the DJ didn't
have any Tiffany songs,

19:30.182 --> 19:33.182
- and then this goose...
- Jimmy Jr.!

19:33.207 --> 19:34.247
Get down from there!

19:34.272 --> 19:35.943
Ow. My butt. My butt.

19:36.088 --> 19:38.348
J-Ju, what a beautiful sacrifice.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.098
Stop biting me, goose!

19:41.178 --> 19:43.348
He's just scared! Bruce, listen to me.

19:43.438 --> 19:46.027
Honk, honk! Honk, honk, honk!

19:46.052 --> 19:47.778
What's... happening?

19:47.898 --> 19:49.358
I don't know!

19:49.383 --> 19:51.253
Oh, my God, is it working?

19:51.278 --> 19:53.488
Oh, no. It's biting him
more than before.

19:53.608 --> 19:54.608
He's bleeding.

19:54.698 --> 19:56.238
So, I'm just gonna reach in!

19:58.778 --> 20:00.763
Bruce! You're okay!

20:00.788 --> 20:02.668
Jimmy Jr., you saved him.

20:02.698 --> 20:04.998
Yeah. You, uh, seemed
really upset, so...

20:05.023 --> 20:07.233
- Mwah.
- Oh. Wow.

20:07.563 --> 20:09.433
So, is your butt okay?

20:09.458 --> 20:11.168
It really hurts.

20:11.298 --> 20:12.628
Should I take a look at it or...

20:12.708 --> 20:14.208
Oh, I-I don't know.

20:14.233 --> 20:16.363
I guess I should probably
just go to the doctor.

20:16.388 --> 20:17.928
Right, right, right.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.903
Bruce, we shared a lot
of great times together.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.428
A lot of laughs and even a few tears.

20:23.478 --> 20:25.414
And one kiss that I don't
really want to talk about.

20:25.438 --> 20:27.568
But this relationship can't last.

20:27.598 --> 20:29.993
Listen, sometimes loving our
own species can be painful.

20:30.018 --> 20:32.833
But maybe it's worth it
because it can also be amazing.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.438
Come on, Tina. Finish dumping your goose

20:34.568 --> 20:35.818
so he can find someone new.

20:35.898 --> 20:37.148
What about that one?

20:37.238 --> 20:39.028
No, I know that duck. Total diva.

20:39.068 --> 20:40.318
What about those swans?

20:40.408 --> 20:41.658
They're so cliquey, Dad.

20:41.738 --> 20:42.868
Bruce,

20:42.948 --> 20:43.988
over there. Hot goose.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.658
Let's see if you two get along.

20:46.138 --> 20:48.288
Oh, wow. You get along really well.

20:48.368 --> 20:50.918
Slow down, guys. You
don't even know each other.

20:50.943 --> 20:52.473
All right, let's go. I got to get home

20:52.498 --> 20:53.748
for my big date with Gretchen.

20:53.773 --> 20:55.643
I'm glad you're getting
back out there, Mom.

20:55.668 --> 20:57.708
Hey, Dad, maybe we can
find you a park animal.

20:57.733 --> 20:59.693
I like that weird duck over there.
