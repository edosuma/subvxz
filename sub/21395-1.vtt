17:47.099 --> 17:48.300
It's not mine.

17:48.367 --> 17:51.069
- Take what, Ansi?
- Nothing, Ms. Clara.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.305
I really should go
find my friends.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.073
- You don't want more toast?

17:55.140 --> 17:56.175
- No, thanks.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.110
Another piece and I'll
literally--

17:58.177 --> 18:00.646
[gasps]
--explode.

18:00.712 --> 18:01.914
That's it!

18:01.980 --> 18:03.882
- Aren't you forgetting
something?

18:03.949 --> 18:05.517
- [gurgles]
- My book!

18:05.584 --> 18:08.187
Come on, JK,
I'm gonna need your help.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.728
- [shield clanks]

18:16.795 --> 18:19.264
- [gadget beeping]
- Olly's beam star.

18:19.331 --> 18:21.300
And that's
Saraline's signal!

18:22.434 --> 18:24.436
- [roaring]
- BOTH: [gasp]

18:25.804 --> 18:27.773
- Sis, I just wanna
say I love you.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.209
- I'm not giving you
my last choc pop, Olly.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.610
- Eh, worth a shot.

18:31.677 --> 18:34.079
- ANSI: [grunts]
- [teeth chomping]

18:34.146 --> 18:35.247
- Ansi, you're safe.

18:35.314 --> 18:37.049
- [chomps]
- Where are we going?

18:37.115 --> 18:38.550
I need to know so
I can more efficiently

18:38.617 --> 18:40.118
resent not being
in control.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.987
- Back to where
we met Sleepyhead.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.522
I've got a plan.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.494
Okay, these squidgets,
they eat that rainbow gas.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.230
And Sleepyhead back
there eats them.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.931
But what if we skipped
the squidgets

18:52.998 --> 18:54.566
and went straight
to the source?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.401
- You mean we just
feed the rainbow gas

18:56.468 --> 18:57.970
directly to Sleepyhead?

18:58.036 --> 18:59.171
What would that do?

18:59.238 --> 19:00.439
- They're like people.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.207
There's a limit to how
much they can eat.

19:02.274 --> 19:03.742
- How is that like people?

19:03.809 --> 19:05.043
- [bag pops]
- Aah!

19:05.110 --> 19:06.345
Stupid demonstration bag.

19:06.411 --> 19:09.314

19:16.054 --> 19:17.055
[grunts]

19:17.122 --> 19:18.323
Whoa!

19:18.390 --> 19:20.459
Uh, I meant
my other sister!

19:20.526 --> 19:21.260
Aah!

19:21.326 --> 19:22.694
- Get your squidgets here!

19:22.761 --> 19:25.330
Hot, fresh rainbow-filled
squidgets.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.165
You want 'em, we got 'em.

19:27.232 --> 19:30.402
Looks like squid, mm,
tastes like chicken!

19:30.469 --> 19:32.738
Don't worry, buddy.

19:38.076 --> 19:39.244

Wait for it.

19:39.311 --> 19:40.913
Wait for it.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.123

19:51.189 --> 19:53.625

you didn't.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.060
- [roaring]

19:55.127 --> 19:57.195
- Do it now!

19:57.262 --> 19:59.464
- [roaring]

20:01.934 --> 20:04.903
- Ansi, that gas is just
making him stronger.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.138
- I don't think so.

20:06.204 --> 20:07.573
Everybody's got their limit.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.308
- I still don't get what
you're talking about.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.276

- Would you stop that?

20:13.879 --> 20:17.015

Huh?

20:22.220 --> 20:24.456

20:29.194 --> 20:30.762
- You guys were awesome.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.831
Are you okay?
- Never better.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.500
And I'm wearing
my big girl pants.

20:35.567 --> 20:36.969
How about you, Ansi?

20:37.035 --> 20:38.704
- No, I don't own any.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.405
Oh! I'm fine.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.510
- Good as new.
- Thanks, Olly.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.714
Well, today was definitely,
uh, fungerous.

20:48.780 --> 20:51.984
- Hang on, Ansi.
There's one more thing.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.485
- What's this?

20:53.552 --> 20:55.187
- If you're gonna be
on Team Timbers,

20:55.253 --> 20:56.822
you'll need some
Timbers tech.

20:56.888 --> 20:59.091
It'll help you find your
way around the Wayne.

20:59.157 --> 21:00.392
- Plus, it makes pig sounds

21:00.459 --> 21:03.061
for those moments when you
just need to hear a pig.

21:03.128 --> 21:06.632
- It's great, but I'm still
not sure if I belong here.

21:06.698 --> 21:09.401
You guys fight spies,
blow up monsters.

21:09.468 --> 21:12.638
I'm into hand sanitizer
and reading poetry.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.440
- What's this?

21:15.507 --> 21:16.842
- I don't know.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.644
John Keats must've snuck
it into my book

21:18.710 --> 21:20.545
while I was in that
secret library.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.115
- You found the library?

21:23.181 --> 21:24.549
Ha!

21:24.616 --> 21:27.953
Take that, Jonah Bishop,
with your foot issues.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.388
- It's just the one issue.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.590
- Guys, look.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.392
My name is on this.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.593
- Whoa.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.995
- And you thought you
didn't belong here.

21:37.062 --> 21:38.530
- But what does it mean?

21:38.597 --> 21:41.266
- That's what we have
to find out.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.301
- [oinking]

21:43.368 --> 21:46.104

Felt like a pig moment.
