00:15.452 --> 00:17.520
Let's get the other
body and get cleaned up

00:17.588 --> 00:18.955
before we head back to CTU.

00:19.023 --> 00:21.591
I'm trying to locate an
individual by the name

00:21.659 --> 00:23.593
of Kevin Wade.

00:23.661 --> 00:26.296
Kevin's probation
officer just called me.

00:26.363 --> 00:27.964
He has records that
show him calling my cell

00:28.032 --> 00:29.766
several times.

00:29.834 --> 00:31.100
Look, you just have
to handle this, okay?

00:31.168 --> 00:32.869
I don't know if I can do this.

00:32.937 --> 00:34.938
Lie. Come on, we both
know you're good at it.

00:35.005 --> 00:37.607
Put your hands where
I can see them!

00:37.675 --> 00:39.609
Do not move!

00:39.677 --> 00:41.711
Samir, Marcos is
out of the chamber.

00:41.779 --> 00:43.713
Hang up right now and
transmit the fail safe!

00:45.316 --> 00:46.583
What's happening? What is that?
! Marcos, I don't know

00:46.650 --> 00:48.518
if I'm gonna be able
to do this in time.

00:48.586 --> 00:50.620
How were they gonna smuggle
the fuel rods into the city

00:50.688 --> 00:52.121
past the radiological detectors?
I don't know!

00:52.189 --> 00:53.857
Damn it, Marcos, give me a name!

00:53.924 --> 00:57.093
President Hassan's head of security,
Tarin Faroush.

01:01.966 --> 01:04.467
Right now you need to call UN
Security and have them take

01:04.535 --> 01:06.336
Mr. Faroush into custody
until we get there.

01:06.403 --> 01:08.638
Tarin's not here. Where is he?

01:08.706 --> 01:10.106
I don't know.
Somewhere with my daughter.

01:10.174 --> 01:12.742
Tarin is working with
your father's enemies.

01:12.810 --> 01:15.278
You must tell me where you are.

01:15.346 --> 01:18.514
The Teodore Hotel, Suite 514.

01:18.582 --> 01:19.582
Just stay where you are.

01:19.650 --> 01:21.451
The police will be there shortly.

01:21.518 --> 01:23.620
I thought we agreed

01:23.687 --> 01:25.255
you weren't gonna take
your mother's call.

01:25.322 --> 01:27.657
I'm sorry, my love,
I just didn't want her to worry.

01:27.725 --> 01:29.259
Did you tell her where we are?

01:29.326 --> 01:30.760
Of course not.

01:33.197 --> 01:34.697
We're arriving at the landing now.

01:34.765 --> 01:38.268
Soon we'll be able to transport
the rods into Manhattan.

01:38.335 --> 01:41.004
Are CTU's radiation sensors down?

01:41.071 --> 01:42.405
Not yet, but we'll be ready.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.953 --> 01:56.986
All right, listen up!

01:58.522 --> 02:01.257
This is what we know.

02:01.325 --> 02:04.727
IRK nationalists are targeting
New York with a dirty bomb.

02:04.795 --> 02:05.962
We have one lead:

02:06.030 --> 02:08.764
Hassan's former head of security,
Tarin Faroush.

02:08.832 --> 02:11.734
We believe he wants to
disable our defenses

02:11.802 --> 02:13.136
so they can smuggle the
bomb into Manhattan.

02:13.203 --> 02:14.504
Chloe?

02:14.571 --> 02:16.339
Latest intel is that Tarin is
staying at the Teodore Hotel

02:16.407 --> 02:18.675
with President Hassan's
daughter, Kayla.

02:18.742 --> 02:20.543
Kayla has been warned by her mother

02:20.611 --> 02:21.978
that Tarin is working
with the terrorists.

02:22.046 --> 02:23.680
She'll be trying to
keep him at the hotel

02:23.747 --> 02:24.881
until our Tac teams arrive.

02:24.949 --> 02:26.115
What's our ETA othat?

02:26.183 --> 02:28.151
NYPD is approaching
the staging area,

02:28.218 --> 02:30.153
CTU still ten minutes out.

02:30.220 --> 02:32.555
Chloe, you liaise with NYPD.

02:32.623 --> 02:34.057
Actually, Dana is better at the

02:34.124 --> 02:37.093
inter-agency protocols than I am.

02:37.161 --> 02:38.828
Fine.

02:38.896 --> 02:40.830
Jack Bauer's heading Field Ops,

02:40.898 --> 02:44.334
Dana's on point with NYPD,
Arlo will run aerial.

02:44.401 --> 02:45.902
Let's get to it.

02:51.275 --> 02:53.910
All the changes going
on around here,

02:53.978 --> 02:55.979
who do I report to exactly,
you or Dana?

02:56.046 --> 02:57.547
What does it matter?

02:57.614 --> 03:00.316
I just like to be clear.
The only thing you need to be

03:00.384 --> 03:02.986
clear about is that there's
a dirty bomb about to go off

03:03.053 --> 03:04.721
in Manhattan, so just do your job.

03:06.824 --> 03:09.492
Drone's in position
over the Teodore Hotel

03:09.560 --> 03:12.362
awaiting your instructions.

03:36.051 --> 03:39.087
Kayla, we have to go.

03:39.154 --> 03:42.156
Nearly ready.

03:46.963 --> 03:48.297
What was that? Are you all right?

03:48.365 --> 03:51.567
It was nothing, I'm fine.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.287
Hello?

04:11.354 --> 04:12.922
The Americans got Marcos to talk.

04:12.989 --> 04:15.257
He may have compromised you.

04:15.325 --> 04:17.692
Did the girl receive
any phone calls?

04:17.761 --> 04:19.361
Yes, one- her mother. Get out now.

04:19.428 --> 04:20.529
And bring her with you.

04:20.596 --> 04:21.697
We're moving to the next phase.

04:21.765 --> 04:22.998
I'll need a vehicle.

04:23.066 --> 04:24.633
Hamid is on his way.

04:28.805 --> 04:30.306
Kayla,

04:30.373 --> 04:33.909
we must go now.

04:33.977 --> 04:37.546
Just one more minute.

04:37.614 --> 04:39.315
Hurry up, please.

04:48.558 --> 04:50.859
Jack, I'm uploading Tarin
Faroush's file to you now.

04:50.927 --> 04:52.061
Copy that.

04:52.128 --> 04:54.363
Okay, I've got it.
We're also gonna need

04:54.431 --> 04:56.999
hotel schematics and access
to their security systems.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.233
Coming to you now.

04:58.301 --> 05:00.402
Target is in room 514.

05:00.470 --> 05:02.738
Hotel security is standing
by to give NYPD access.

05:02.806 --> 05:05.407
Jack, Brian Hastings.
What's your ETA?

05:05.475 --> 05:06.575
About eight minutes.
Can you patch me through

05:06.643 --> 05:07.810
to our point man at NYPD?

05:07.877 --> 05:09.044
We're doing that now.

05:09.112 --> 05:11.714
Name's, uh, Sergeant Amis.

05:11.781 --> 05:12.781
Sergeant Amis, Dana Walsh, CTU.

05:12.849 --> 05:14.650
Been waiting on you, Ms. Walsh.

05:14.718 --> 05:16.151
We're in our staging area already.

05:16.219 --> 05:17.486
Go ahead, Jack.

05:17.554 --> 05:18.654
Sergeant Amis, Jack Bauer.

05:18.722 --> 05:21.490
Our target, Tarin Faroush,
is in room 514.

05:21.558 --> 05:23.192
He has a female hostage,
Kayla Hassan.

05:23.259 --> 05:25.728
She's the daughter of
President Hassan of the IRK.

05:25.795 --> 05:27.196
We'll handle him, Mr. Bauer.

05:27.263 --> 05:29.698
We'll make sure that girl
doesn't come to any harm.

05:29.766 --> 05:31.100
The priority is to
take Tarin alive.

05:31.167 --> 05:32.267
He's our only lead to a major

05:32.335 --> 05:33.302
terrorist threat against New York.

05:33.370 --> 05:34.503
Like I said, we'll handle him.

05:34.571 --> 05:35.971
Sergeant, don't
underestimate this man.

05:36.039 --> 05:37.406
He was President Hassan's
head of security.

05:37.474 --> 05:38.941
He knows what he's doing.

05:39.009 --> 05:41.076
I want your men to set up a
perimeter and wait for us.

05:41.144 --> 05:42.578
We're monitoring hotel security.

05:42.646 --> 05:43.746
We'll give you a heads-up

05:43.813 --> 05:44.980
if we've got any
action from the room.

05:48.952 --> 05:50.686
Kayla, my friend from
the State Department

05:50.754 --> 05:52.988
is waiting for us! We must go now.

05:53.056 --> 05:55.224
Just one more second, please.

06:17.714 --> 06:18.881
Kayla!

06:21.384 --> 06:22.851
Kayla!

06:24.154 --> 06:26.255
Tarin, what are you doing?!

06:26.322 --> 06:27.823
Stop this game.
We walk out of here right now.

06:27.891 --> 06:28.991
No, I'm not going anywhere.

06:29.059 --> 06:30.025
Just move! Oh, no!

06:30.093 --> 06:31.527
Where are you taking me?

06:31.594 --> 06:33.095
Believe me, the last thing
I want to do is hurt you,

06:33.163 --> 06:34.329
but I will.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.435
Got movement on the fifth floor.

06:39.502 --> 06:40.903
Are you getting this, Jack?

06:40.970 --> 06:43.072
Yeah, someone must've
tipped him off. Sergeant?

06:43.139 --> 06:44.206
Yes, I know, target's on the move.

06:44.274 --> 06:45.340
I'm going in.

06:45.408 --> 06:46.475
Negative. We're five minutes out.

06:46.543 --> 06:47.776
I want you to hold your position.

06:47.844 --> 06:50.179
I'm on the ground, Mr.
Bauer; it's my call.

06:50.246 --> 06:51.747
No, it isn't,
this is a CTU operation.

06:51.815 --> 06:53.449
I am telling you to
hold your position.

06:53.516 --> 06:55.050
I'm going in. Sergeant!

06:59.155 --> 07:00.289
Tarin's at the elevators.

07:07.263 --> 07:09.164
Lost picture on the fifth.
Sergeant, target has

07:09.232 --> 07:11.967
taken out elevator security
camera and is armed.

07:12.035 --> 07:13.635
I am ordering you to stand down.

07:13.703 --> 07:14.737
I'm right on him.

07:14.804 --> 07:16.071
Sergeant, that was an order!

07:23.246 --> 07:25.380
Sergeant Amis, can you hear me?

07:25.448 --> 07:26.882
Ser- Chloe, have you got anything!?

07:26.950 --> 07:28.417
Nothing.

07:48.805 --> 07:50.439
OFFICER Shots fired, shots fired.

07:50.507 --> 07:53.642
We have shots fired.
All NYPD units report status.

07:53.710 --> 07:56.645
Repeat, report status.

07:56.713 --> 07:58.280
This is Faulkner. I'm hit.

07:58.348 --> 08:00.282
Amis and Martin are down.
Where's the target?

08:00.350 --> 08:02.317
He's heading toward the fire
escape on the south side.

08:02.385 --> 08:03.819
He's got the girl.

08:03.887 --> 08:06.622
ESU, this is Agent Ortiz.
Cover the south fire escape now!

08:06.689 --> 08:08.190
Medics, men down
on the fifth floor.

08:08.258 --> 08:10.359
That doesn't make sense.
What do you mean?

08:10.426 --> 08:11.760
Tarin just took out three men.

08:11.828 --> 08:12.895
Why's he using the fire escape?

08:12.962 --> 08:14.229
He should be heading
down the stairs.

08:14.297 --> 08:16.131
Son of a bitch.

08:16.199 --> 08:19.168
NYPD, target is impersonating
an officer; he has the girl.

08:19.235 --> 08:21.436
I want you to fall back
and cover all exits.

08:21.504 --> 08:23.939
I repeat, target is
impersonating an officer.

08:24.007 --> 08:25.174
Cover all exits!

08:31.314 --> 08:33.215
Chloe, do you see anything?
Nothing.

08:33.283 --> 08:36.083
Send us back the drone feed.
Roger that.

08:38.955 --> 08:40.222
Drop the gun!

08:40.289 --> 08:41.423
Put it down! No, no!

08:41.491 --> 08:42.457
Drop it now! This is Bellow.

08:42.525 --> 08:43.792
Target's at the Allen Street exit.

08:43.860 --> 08:45.894
He's got the girl.
Chloe, we need that drone feed.

08:45.962 --> 08:47.095
Coming through.

08:47.163 --> 08:50.165
There's a cab pulling up.

08:50.233 --> 08:52.668
Officer Bellow, behind you!

08:58.274 --> 08:59.541
They're heading for the cab.

08:59.609 --> 09:00.876
All ESU, we have

09:00.944 --> 09:02.878
two officers down in the
alley behind the hotel.

09:02.946 --> 09:04.613
Target is moving to Allen Street.

09:04.681 --> 09:07.216
He's escaping in the yellow cab.
Tracking the cab.

09:07.283 --> 09:09.418
Go!

09:10.653 --> 09:11.987
Advise all NYPD mobile units,

09:12.055 --> 09:13.488
we cannot lose that vehicle.

09:13.556 --> 09:16.091
On it. Taxi's in the
Delancey underpass.

09:16.159 --> 09:18.160
I'm blind. Do we have traffic cams?

09:18.228 --> 09:19.728
Not in the underpass.

09:19.796 --> 09:20.829
We're two blocks from Delancey.

09:27.737 --> 09:29.805
Any sign of the cab?
Still in the underpass.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.607
The underpass is less
than half a click.

09:31.674 --> 09:33.108
Where the hell are they?

09:33.176 --> 09:34.910
NYPD mobile units, 90 seconds out.

09:34.978 --> 09:36.945
Go left, Jack, go left right here!

09:52.362 --> 09:54.997
There it is. I got the cab.
I got the cab.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.475
Driver!

10:06.542 --> 10:08.644
I want you to slowly
open your door!

10:12.448 --> 10:15.183
Open the door now!

10:19.856 --> 10:21.790
It's empty.

10:21.858 --> 10:23.825
It's empty!

10:23.893 --> 10:25.594
Chloe, backtrack drone footage.

10:25.662 --> 10:27.429
Trace every vehicle
that left the underpass.

10:27.497 --> 10:28.597
Get NYPD to set roadblocks.

10:28.665 --> 10:30.332
They were here less
than 30 seconds ago!

10:30.400 --> 10:31.767
Arlo? Got it.

10:31.834 --> 10:34.369
We should join the sweep.
No, they're gone.

10:34.437 --> 10:36.805
You don't know that.
Yeah, I do, they're gone.

10:36.873 --> 10:38.507
Chloe, it's Jack,
I'm gonna need a kidnap

10:38.574 --> 10:39.641
and an electronic
intercept package.

10:39.709 --> 10:41.643
Have it meet me back
at the UN. Copy.

10:41.711 --> 10:43.645
I need to talk to President Hassan.

10:43.713 --> 10:45.948
That's who the terrorists are
gonna want to contact next.

10:46.015 --> 10:47.786
That's why they
kidnapped his daughter.

11:08.471 --> 11:09.805
Tarin just called.

11:09.872 --> 11:11.206
He has the girl.

11:19.515 --> 11:20.916
Hello.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.018
Ahman. Samir,
where are the nuclear rods?

11:23.086 --> 11:24.987
They're still outside the city.

11:25.054 --> 11:27.923
We haven't disabled the American
radiological detectors yet.

11:27.991 --> 11:30.926
Then how will you
bring the rods to me?

11:30.994 --> 11:33.562
It's been taken care of.

11:44.936 --> 11:46.503
Here, Mr. Prady. Thank you.

11:46.571 --> 11:48.872
Give me one moment. Yeah.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.808
We've backtracked through
drone and traffic cam footage

11:50.875 --> 11:52.009
looking for Kayla and Tarin.

11:52.076 --> 11:53.243
Nothing's come up yet.

11:53.311 --> 11:54.444
What's Bauer's status?

11:54.512 --> 11:55.712
He's two minutes from the UN.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.681
An electronic intercept
team is en route to him.

11:57.749 --> 11:58.982
Keep me informed.

11:59.050 --> 12:00.484
Copy.

12:00.552 --> 12:02.252
Ms. Walsh.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.887
There's a Mr.
Prady here to see you.

12:03.955 --> 12:05.522
Says he spoke to you on the phone.

12:05.590 --> 12:06.857
Thank you.

12:11.129 --> 12:13.330
Chloe.

12:13.398 --> 12:16.867
Would you mind covering
for me for a few minutes?

12:39.657 --> 12:40.924
Mr. Prady.

12:40.992 --> 12:42.860
Dana Walsh. A pleasure, Ms. Walsh.

12:42.927 --> 12:44.294
It'll be quieter in here.

12:44.362 --> 12:46.430
Mm-hmm.

12:46.497 --> 12:49.233
Uh, this is, uh...

12:49.300 --> 12:51.568
this is some impressive facility.

12:51.636 --> 12:53.270
What, uh...

12:53.338 --> 12:54.938
what is it you do here?

12:56.608 --> 12:58.909
Intelligence analyst.

12:58.977 --> 13:01.144
Mr. Prady, we've got a
major situation here...

13:01.212 --> 13:04.047
I understand. I won't
take up much of your time.

13:04.115 --> 13:05.582
Okay.

13:05.650 --> 13:08.919
It's 3:00 in the morning,
you're 2,000 miles from home.

13:08.987 --> 13:10.487
You mind telling me
what's so urgent?

13:10.555 --> 13:11.889
Yeah. It's about the young man

13:11.956 --> 13:15.058
I mentioned on the phone-
Kevin Wade.

13:15.126 --> 13:17.160
This is him right here.

13:27.538 --> 13:29.206
You know him, don't you?

13:31.309 --> 13:32.809
Yes.

13:35.413 --> 13:39.082
I should have been honest
with you on the phone.

13:41.486 --> 13:44.988
I met Kevin a couple
days ago at a bar.

13:45.056 --> 13:47.324
Was there another man with him?

13:47.392 --> 13:49.026
He was traveling

13:49.093 --> 13:51.161
with an ex-con named Nick Coughlin.

13:51.229 --> 13:52.863
Bad news.

13:52.931 --> 13:56.400
Done time on robbery,
attempted murder.

13:59.570 --> 14:02.572
No. No, I've never seen him.

14:05.944 --> 14:07.978
Okay.

14:08.046 --> 14:13.050
So, what happened...
with you and Kevin?

14:15.053 --> 14:18.255
Um...

14:18.323 --> 14:21.959
we talked for a while.

14:22.026 --> 14:24.261
I drank more than I should,

14:24.329 --> 14:26.430
and we ended up back in his van.

14:26.497 --> 14:28.198
You had sex with him.

14:30.335 --> 14:31.768
Yes.

14:31.836 --> 14:33.937
Do you know where he is now?

14:36.207 --> 14:37.908
No. I didn't see him again.

14:37.976 --> 14:39.543
The whole thing was a mistake.

14:39.610 --> 14:41.912
Why so?

14:41.980 --> 14:45.749
Because I am getting
married in a few weeks.

14:45.817 --> 14:47.217
It was the pressure.

14:47.285 --> 14:48.518
I- I don't know.

14:48.586 --> 14:50.754
All the wedding plans.

14:50.822 --> 14:52.122
I went out for a drink.

14:52.190 --> 14:55.192
I didn't intend to...

14:55.259 --> 14:57.761
Maybe I did. I don't know.

14:59.263 --> 15:00.664
I don't know anything anymore.

15:00.732 --> 15:03.166
All that I know is that
if my fiancÃƒfÃ‚Â© finds out,

15:03.234 --> 15:04.568
he will never forgive me.

15:04.635 --> 15:06.203
I'm not looking to ruin your life.

15:06.270 --> 15:08.305
I just want to retrieve Kevin

15:08.373 --> 15:10.407
before he gets in more trouble

15:10.475 --> 15:12.776
than violating his parole.

15:16.247 --> 15:17.314
I understand.

15:17.382 --> 15:19.216
I... I hope that you find him.

15:19.283 --> 15:21.418
Yeah, thing is, Miss Walsh,

15:21.486 --> 15:23.854
I got a call a couple hours ago

15:23.921 --> 15:26.690
from my NYPD friend, Tom Hardiman.

15:26.758 --> 15:29.993
Seems like there was a...
a break-in

15:30.061 --> 15:31.628
at a police evidence lockup.

15:31.696 --> 15:34.398
Again, bad business.

15:34.465 --> 15:36.233
Officer got beaten up,
left in a coma,

15:36.300 --> 15:37.567
but guess whose prints

15:37.635 --> 15:40.370
were on the assault weapon?

15:40.438 --> 15:43.573
Yeah, that nasty SOB,
Nick Coughlin.

15:43.641 --> 15:45.842
Now, what I'm afraid of is...

15:45.910 --> 15:48.111
where Nick is, Kevin is, too,

15:48.179 --> 15:50.147
and I really need to find him.

15:50.214 --> 15:52.983
And, like I told you,
I only saw him the once.

15:53.051 --> 15:55.218
I have no idea where he is.

15:57.255 --> 15:58.922
And you're sure about that?

16:00.491 --> 16:04.861
Mr. Prady, we are in the middle
of a national security crisis.

16:04.929 --> 16:06.496
I have to go back to my desk.

16:06.564 --> 16:07.731
Okay. Okay.

16:07.799 --> 16:09.099
I'm sorry.

16:09.167 --> 16:10.801
Perhaps, if I talk
to your supervisor,

16:10.868 --> 16:14.638
he could let you take
a few minutes off.

16:17.875 --> 16:21.111
Or I could wait here,

16:21.179 --> 16:24.614
stay out of your way
till you have some time.

16:24.682 --> 16:26.083
Fine.

16:26.150 --> 16:27.751
You have to stay here, though.

16:27.819 --> 16:29.753
Of course.

16:29.821 --> 16:31.555
Okay. Mm-hmm.

16:35.626 --> 16:36.626
I don't understand.

16:36.694 --> 16:38.428
The Americans knew where Kayla was.

16:38.496 --> 16:40.097
How did they lose her?

16:40.164 --> 16:42.032
Before we blame them, remember...

16:42.100 --> 16:43.900
it was our people- our own people-

16:43.968 --> 16:46.570
who kidnapped Kayla,
not the Americans.

16:48.339 --> 16:51.374
Mr. President, CTU is here.

16:54.846 --> 16:56.480
Mr. President, I'm Jack Bauer.

16:56.547 --> 16:58.014
You already know Cole Ortiz.

16:58.082 --> 16:59.649
We deeply regret not being able

16:59.717 --> 17:01.118
to find your daughter,
but I promise you,

17:01.185 --> 17:02.152
we're going to do everything

17:02.220 --> 17:03.487
in our power to recover her.

17:03.554 --> 17:05.655
How did you lose her?
How did that happen?

17:05.723 --> 17:07.290
Tarin had been warned, ma'am.
We arrived too late.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.492
It was your people...

17:08.559 --> 17:09.693
Dalia, please.

17:12.163 --> 17:13.762
What do they want with Kayla?

17:13.830 --> 17:15.298
We were hoping you
could tell us, sir.

17:15.366 --> 17:17.934
Tarin Faroush was
your head of security,

17:18.002 --> 17:19.435
meaning he knows
everything that you know.

17:19.503 --> 17:20.936
He took your daughter
because he's trying

17:21.005 --> 17:22.771
to leverage something from you.
Do you have

17:22.839 --> 17:24.174
any idea what that could be?

17:24.242 --> 17:25.509
I don't know.

17:25.576 --> 17:26.843
Sir,

17:26.911 --> 17:28.845
we believe the kidnappers
will contact you directly.

17:28.913 --> 17:31.181
We need to set up monitoring
devices on your phones

17:31.249 --> 17:32.415
so we can track their call.

17:32.483 --> 17:34.117
Do what you need to do.
Just, please,

17:34.185 --> 17:35.819
get our child back.

17:35.887 --> 17:36.887
Dalia.

17:36.954 --> 17:38.054
Please.

17:38.122 --> 17:39.189
Thank you.

17:39.257 --> 17:40.957
With me.

17:44.495 --> 17:46.396
Set up tech here.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.501
Tarin! Don't.

17:51.569 --> 17:53.236
Please.

17:55.139 --> 17:56.706
Don't. Come on.

17:56.774 --> 17:59.142
Please.

18:07.051 --> 18:09.653
Do what he says,
and you won't get hurt.

18:10.855 --> 18:12.022
Who is he?

18:12.089 --> 18:13.723
Another traitor?

18:20.598 --> 18:23.867
The only traitor is your father.

18:25.703 --> 18:27.771
Tie her up.

18:30.308 --> 18:31.474
No.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.610
No. No. No.

18:59.031 --> 19:00.565
Do you recognize the number?

19:00.633 --> 19:02.934
There isn't one.
Chloe, we've got a call

19:03.002 --> 19:04.636
coming in on the
mother's cell phone.

19:04.703 --> 19:07.305
We're working on it.

19:07.373 --> 19:08.473
Answer it.

19:08.541 --> 19:11.276
Keep them on the phone
as long as possible.

19:11.343 --> 19:12.911
Yes?

19:12.978 --> 19:15.446
Your husband is a traitor to
the people of the Republic.

19:15.514 --> 19:18.349
He alone has made our
actions necessary.

19:18.417 --> 19:20.118
He cannot be trusted.

19:20.186 --> 19:21.686
Where is my daughter?

19:21.754 --> 19:23.755
I want to talk to her.

19:23.823 --> 19:27.192
Whether you ever see
her again depends

19:27.259 --> 19:29.727
on what your husband
does right now.

19:29.795 --> 19:30.995
Put him on. Dalia?

19:31.063 --> 19:32.363
They want to talk to you.

19:32.431 --> 19:33.598
Here, give me the phone.

19:33.666 --> 19:34.666
We need to be hearing this.

19:34.733 --> 19:36.067
We're still working on it, Jack.

19:36.135 --> 19:39.003
Okay, we've got it.
You should have audio.

19:39.071 --> 19:41.072
This is President Hassan.

19:41.140 --> 19:42.874
Who are you?

19:42.942 --> 19:44.442
I'm a loyal servant of the Republic

19:44.510 --> 19:45.910
you are trying to destroy.

19:45.978 --> 19:47.946
Now, shut up, Omar, and listen.

19:48.013 --> 19:49.647
I want to lk to my daughter.

19:49.715 --> 19:52.684
Let me tell you what I want.

19:52.751 --> 19:54.886
File 33.

19:56.755 --> 19:58.089
File 33.

19:58.157 --> 20:00.258
That is the price of your daughter.

20:00.326 --> 20:02.360
I don't know what that is.

20:02.428 --> 20:04.028
You had to say that.

20:04.096 --> 20:05.697
Of course.

20:05.764 --> 20:08.199
You're a vain man,

20:08.267 --> 20:09.701
concerned about appearances,

20:09.768 --> 20:12.537
and the Americans are listening.

20:13.572 --> 20:15.874
But please...

20:15.941 --> 20:18.910
do not insult me by
saying this again.

20:18.978 --> 20:21.713
I won't say anything until
I talk to my daughter.

20:21.780 --> 20:23.548
Fine.

20:23.616 --> 20:26.017
If that's what you want.

20:26.085 --> 20:28.119
I'm sending you an IP address.

20:28.187 --> 20:30.588
Give it to one of the
people listening in.

20:39.198 --> 20:40.498
Okay, got it.

20:51.209 --> 20:52.709
Don't hurt her.

20:52.777 --> 20:54.244
It's me you want.

20:58.883 --> 21:00.484
I told you what I want.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.286
File 33.

21:02.354 --> 21:04.755
I told you-
I don't know what that is.

21:04.823 --> 21:06.590
Take me instead.

21:14.166 --> 21:15.599
You have 15 minutes.

21:15.667 --> 21:16.801
No excuses, no stalling.

21:16.868 --> 21:18.736
15 minutes or she dies here,
like this,

21:18.804 --> 21:19.870
while you watch.

21:19.938 --> 21:21.138
Stop it.

21:21.206 --> 21:22.573
Stop it!

21:22.641 --> 21:25.109
I'll find the file. Whatever it is,

21:25.177 --> 21:26.110
I'll get it for you!

21:32.417 --> 21:33.584
Mr. President,

21:33.652 --> 21:34.952
what is File 33?

21:35.020 --> 21:36.253
Omar! Mr. Bauer,

21:36.321 --> 21:39.123
I've got Brian
Hastings on the line.

21:41.359 --> 21:42.793
Yeah.

21:42.861 --> 21:44.695
Jack, you know anything
about this file?

21:44.763 --> 21:46.697
No, but I'm standing here
with President Hassan.

21:46.765 --> 21:48.098
I'll put you on speaker.

21:48.166 --> 21:49.200
Go ahead.

21:49.267 --> 21:50.601
Mr. President,
this is Brian Hastings.

21:50.669 --> 21:52.703
I have no intel on the
file they're talking about.

21:52.771 --> 21:54.238
Can you tell me what this is?

21:57.108 --> 21:58.642
Sir, they gave you 15 minutes.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.544
If you want to see your daughter again,
you don't have time

22:00.612 --> 22:01.812
to waste.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.881
Omar, what is this file?

22:13.458 --> 22:15.493
Show them.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.330
Show them!

22:25.337 --> 22:27.271
Dalia,

22:27.339 --> 22:29.273
I'll do anything for Kayla.

22:29.341 --> 22:30.774
I would give

22:30.842 --> 22:31.775
my own life.

22:31.843 --> 22:33.177
Then give them this file.

22:33.245 --> 22:35.246
Sir?

22:54.232 --> 22:57.268
Put it up on the screen,
mirror it over to CTU.

23:04.409 --> 23:06.844
Hastings, are you seeing this?

23:06.912 --> 23:08.879
Yes, I am.

23:08.947 --> 23:10.381
Mr. President,

23:10.448 --> 23:12.616
this file appears to
contain operational details

23:12.684 --> 23:15.219
of all U.S. anti-nuclear defenses.

23:15.287 --> 23:16.587
That's correct.

23:16.655 --> 23:19.490
Including our radiological
detection arrays.

23:19.558 --> 23:22.426
This is highly-
classified DOD material.

23:22.494 --> 23:24.528
I need to know how you got this.

23:24.596 --> 23:26.230
How do you think, Mr. Hastings?

23:27.799 --> 23:31.468
For 20 years, your nation
has threatened mine

23:31.536 --> 23:33.270
with everything from
economic sanctions

23:33.338 --> 23:35.406
to military attack.

23:35.473 --> 23:37.641
So we gathered intelligence

23:37.709 --> 23:39.710
and found weaknesses
in your defenses.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.214
We did what any other
country would do.

23:44.282 --> 23:45.950
Mr. President,

23:46.017 --> 23:48.218
that file shows the fatal flaws

23:48.286 --> 23:50.120
of our nuclear
detection capabilities.

23:50.188 --> 23:51.956
If the terrorists were to get that,

23:52.023 --> 23:54.191
they could smuggle the
fuel rods into Manhattan.

23:54.259 --> 23:55.359
Surely you understand,

23:55.427 --> 23:57.394
we cannot let you
give that to them.

23:57.462 --> 23:59.530
We're talking about the lives
of tens of thousands of people.

23:59.598 --> 24:00.764
And what of my daughter?

24:01.800 --> 24:03.701
What of her life?

24:03.768 --> 24:07.771
With all due respect, madam,
your family brought this threat

24:07.839 --> 24:09.139
to my country.

24:09.207 --> 24:11.575
We're doing the best we can.

24:11.643 --> 24:12.876
Jack, you still on?

24:12.944 --> 24:14.612
Yeah, we all are.

24:14.679 --> 24:16.647
Jack, we may have a lead
on the daughter's location.

24:16.715 --> 24:18.482
Arlo isolated a subway
noise from the video feed

24:18.550 --> 24:20.818
at the end of the transmission,
cross-referencing it with

24:20.885 --> 24:22.252
the real-time train
positions as of this moment.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.021
There aren't a lot of
trains this late at night,

24:24.089 --> 24:25.923
especially within the radius that

24:25.991 --> 24:28.158
they could have traveled to. They were
heading southeast when they left the hotel.

24:28.226 --> 24:29.760
They've got to be
near the F train stop

24:29.828 --> 24:30.995
by the Williamsburg Bridge.

24:31.062 --> 24:33.263
Copy that. Cole and I
will head down there now.

24:33.331 --> 24:35.132
We'll bring Tac from here.
You need me to send a second team?

24:35.200 --> 24:37.568
Yes, and aerial.
Everything you've got.

24:37.636 --> 24:39.503
Have your men ready and assembled
in five minutes. Right away.

24:39.571 --> 24:42.239
Mr. President, we're going
to need you to stall them

24:42.307 --> 24:43.674
when they call back. How?

24:43.742 --> 24:45.509
We'll set up a fake file
that you can transmit.

24:45.577 --> 24:47.177
They'll see through that,
Mr. Bauer.

24:47.245 --> 24:49.179
Eventually, but right
now we just need you

24:49.247 --> 24:51.181
to stall them long enough so
we can locate your daughter.

24:51.249 --> 24:53.250
Stall them any way you can,
but you need to make this work.

24:53.318 --> 24:54.952
We will do whatever we have to.

24:55.020 --> 24:57.187
Thank you.

25:38.263 --> 25:40.197
Tarin.

25:40.265 --> 25:41.198
Please, don't say...

25:41.266 --> 25:42.332
Why are you doing this? Please.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.634
Why are you doing this?

25:43.702 --> 25:45.636
Please don't say anything more.

25:45.704 --> 25:47.705
Please.

26:09.260 --> 26:11.662
Is there trouble? No.
Why would there be?

26:14.299 --> 26:15.532
What's the problem?

26:15.600 --> 26:17.401
They're never going to
hand over that file.

26:17.469 --> 26:19.069
They have to. And if they don't?!

26:19.137 --> 26:21.105
Killing her was not
part of the plan.

26:21.172 --> 26:22.372
You were willing to die

26:22.440 --> 26:23.807
in Hassan's limousine
earlier today.

26:23.875 --> 26:26.009
You were willing to do
anything for our cause.

26:26.077 --> 26:28.011
I still am.

26:28.079 --> 26:29.346
You assured me your feelings

26:29.414 --> 26:31.915
for this girl would
not get in the way.

26:31.983 --> 26:35.385
So tell me,

26:35.453 --> 26:38.155
do I need someone else
to take care of her?

26:43.528 --> 26:45.562
No.

26:45.630 --> 26:47.197
Stay strong.

26:48.233 --> 26:50.234
We're almost there.

27:17.642 --> 27:19.743
Arlo, what's the status
on our target area?

27:19.811 --> 27:21.478
Still looking at almost
six square blocks.

27:21.546 --> 27:23.247
How far out are Jack and Cole?

27:23.315 --> 27:24.248
Six minutes.

27:24.316 --> 27:25.482
That leaves us about 30 seconds

27:25.550 --> 27:26.650
to find her.

27:26.718 --> 27:27.885
We've got to narrow this down.

27:27.953 --> 27:30.187
Where's the second Tac team?
Leaving now.

27:30.255 --> 27:32.222
Uh... Dana?

27:32.290 --> 27:34.024
Huh?

27:34.092 --> 27:35.092
Who is that?

27:38.630 --> 27:40.631
Nobody.

27:42.934 --> 27:44.602
Mr. Prady, this is a secure area.

27:44.669 --> 27:46.337
If you're not gonna
wait in holding,

27:46.404 --> 27:47.705
I'm gonna have to ask you

27:47.772 --> 27:49.707
to leave. I'm sorry.
I had a question.

27:49.774 --> 27:52.142
And I'm in the middle of a situation.
I don't have time.

27:52.210 --> 27:53.677
Well, I wouldn't be bothering you,

27:53.745 --> 27:55.713
but I just got off the
phone with my NYPD friend.

27:55.780 --> 27:57.448
He said I absolutely
have to ask you

27:57.515 --> 28:00.117
about the security cameras at
the police evidence lockup.

28:00.185 --> 28:01.719
Because you know what?

28:01.786 --> 28:03.988
It turns out they malfunctioned

28:04.055 --> 28:06.023
for the exact duration
of the incident.

28:06.091 --> 28:09.193
Well, somebody obviously
disabled the cameras.

28:09.260 --> 28:10.694
Well, yeah, but not Nick and Kevin.

28:10.762 --> 28:13.864
I mean, a crowbar is about as
high-tech as those two get.

28:13.932 --> 28:16.200
Now, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

28:16.267 --> 28:19.903
See, I'm thinking that someone
must have helped them.

28:26.411 --> 28:29.413
Now, my friend says
that all the raw video

28:29.481 --> 28:33.584
from every government facility
feeds right here into CTU.

28:33.652 --> 28:35.219
Am I understanding that right?

28:35.286 --> 28:37.187
Yes. He also said-

28:37.255 --> 28:39.923
correct me if I'm wrong- that

28:39.991 --> 28:42.326
the digital images
are archived every

28:42.394 --> 28:45.029
eight hours, and metadata-

28:45.096 --> 28:46.630
is that what it's called,
metadata?-

28:46.698 --> 28:48.732
that allows you to trace

28:48.800 --> 28:52.603
the exact source of
any service outage.

28:52.671 --> 28:55.973
So, everything I need to
solve this is right here.

28:56.041 --> 28:58.275
You can get it for me, right?

28:58.343 --> 29:01.412
Mr. Prady, we don't just give
data to people off the street.

29:01.479 --> 29:02.579
Well, now, that's right.

29:02.647 --> 29:03.747
That's right.

29:03.815 --> 29:06.950
You need, uh,
an IDRAN- an Interagency

29:07.018 --> 29:09.586
Data Request Authorization Number.

29:09.654 --> 29:11.822
Yeah, Hardiman gave
me one of those.

29:11.890 --> 29:14.758
He said everything should fit

29:14.826 --> 29:17.094
on a 100-gig thumb drive.

29:18.363 --> 29:20.097
So is that going to be a problem,

29:20.165 --> 29:21.398
getting that for me?

29:25.603 --> 29:28.538
No.

29:28.606 --> 29:30.574
Good.

29:36.013 --> 29:37.414
They reprocessed the subway noise,

29:37.481 --> 29:38.416
managed to narrow
down the search grid.

29:38.483 --> 29:39.584
How big?

29:39.651 --> 29:40.785
About 12 buildings total.

29:40.852 --> 29:42.253
Apartments, offices, retail.

29:42.321 --> 29:43.454
It's still too much
ground to cover.

29:47.325 --> 29:49.726
Agent Ortiz.

29:49.794 --> 29:51.595
Dana?

29:51.662 --> 29:54.798
Cole... it's over.

29:54.865 --> 29:56.700
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I heard you.

29:56.767 --> 29:57.901
The parole officer looking

29:57.969 --> 29:59.603
for Kevin is here at CTU.

29:59.670 --> 30:01.204
Knows about the robbery,

30:01.272 --> 30:02.772
the cameras, everything.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.007
Are you certain?

30:04.075 --> 30:05.675
Yeah.

30:07.478 --> 30:09.446
He's after the raw feeds.

30:09.513 --> 30:12.382
He's got an interagency request.

30:15.586 --> 30:17.721
I'm going to give it to him, Cole.

30:17.788 --> 30:19.022
I'm sorry to call you.

30:19.090 --> 30:20.223
I just thought

30:20.291 --> 30:21.358
that you should know.

30:21.425 --> 30:22.459
Why don't you wait?

30:22.526 --> 30:24.761
Do you hear me?
He knows everything.

30:24.829 --> 30:25.996
He'll go to Hastings.

30:26.063 --> 30:27.964
Don't do anything.
We'll talk about it

30:28.032 --> 30:29.799
when I get back.

30:29.867 --> 30:31.568
I can't wait.

30:31.636 --> 30:33.203
If you're here,

30:33.271 --> 30:35.905
you'll just get in more
trouble trying to protect me.

30:38.175 --> 30:40.176
I can't let that happen.

30:42.380 --> 30:45.582
I love you, Cole.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.320
Dana? Dana?

30:50.388 --> 30:51.621
You got a problem? No.

30:51.689 --> 30:53.356
Good, 'cause I need you
to keep your head in this.

30:53.424 --> 30:54.357
You understand?

30:54.425 --> 30:56.359
You got it.

31:00.564 --> 31:02.599
Omar.

31:02.667 --> 31:05.135
We're running out of time.

31:05.202 --> 31:08.038
The technicians have prepared

31:08.105 --> 31:10.106
the file I'll be sending.

31:10.174 --> 31:12.809
But these people who have Kayla-

31:12.877 --> 31:15.145
they won't believe a fake file.

31:15.212 --> 31:16.146
No.

31:16.213 --> 31:18.481
But they might believe you.

31:20.718 --> 31:22.218
You have a gift, Omar.

31:22.286 --> 31:23.953
When you talk, people listen.

31:24.021 --> 31:27.157
You need to convince them,
for our daughter.

31:27.224 --> 31:30.527
Say whatever you
need to to buy time.

31:33.931 --> 31:37.467
I have seen you
move so many people.

31:37.535 --> 31:38.668
You can do this.

31:38.736 --> 31:40.203
I know it.

31:40.271 --> 31:42.706
Yeah.

31:42.773 --> 31:44.307
Mr. President?

31:44.375 --> 31:46.776
I'm sorry.

31:46.844 --> 31:48.011
It's time.

32:08.032 --> 32:09.799
The deadline is here.

32:09.867 --> 32:11.868
Your father has not responded.

32:11.936 --> 32:13.737
You hate him that much,
you would do this

32:13.804 --> 32:16.106
to me?

32:18.442 --> 32:20.377
Tarin...

32:20.444 --> 32:22.445
I don't want to die.

32:31.055 --> 32:33.089
Please.

32:33.157 --> 32:35.058
Then let us pray

32:35.126 --> 32:37.827
for once your father
does the right thing.

32:37.895 --> 32:40.096
Tarin, you can't let them do this.

32:40.164 --> 32:41.297
I know you.

32:41.365 --> 32:42.465
Shh.

32:42.533 --> 32:44.267
This is not you.

32:44.335 --> 32:45.969
And I know in my heart

32:46.036 --> 32:47.771
that you love me.

32:47.838 --> 32:49.773
In my heart I know.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.976
And so I don't understand why...

32:55.079 --> 32:57.080
Nearly there, sir.

33:01.352 --> 33:03.586
Okay, the uplink's ready.

33:10.327 --> 33:12.328
Let's go.

33:13.998 --> 33:15.932
Stop them!

33:16.000 --> 33:18.968
W- Wait, wait, wait.

33:23.441 --> 33:25.341
Follow me.

33:35.953 --> 33:37.787
This way, come on.

33:37.855 --> 33:39.155
My father will help us.

33:39.223 --> 33:40.557
He's surrounded by traitors.

33:40.624 --> 33:42.625
We have to get to CTU.

33:50.267 --> 33:51.634
Here, the number is
in this cell phone.

33:51.702 --> 33:52.702
Call them.

33:53.637 --> 33:56.339
Tarin, no, no!

33:59.877 --> 34:02.145
Tarin, no!

34:02.213 --> 34:03.780
Tarin!

34:03.848 --> 34:04.848
No.

34:04.915 --> 34:06.883
Tarin!

34:35.524 --> 34:37.458
Omar, what has happened to her?

34:37.525 --> 34:40.027
Did the Americans stop the call?

34:40.094 --> 34:41.462
I don't know.

34:41.530 --> 34:43.518
Maybe they were afraid we'd
hand over the real file.

34:44.100 --> 34:47.601
They could have gotten
our daughter killed.

34:55.710 --> 34:57.445
Why aren't we seeing anything?
We're not sure.

34:57.513 --> 34:58.813
Arlo's been scanning
the audio source.

34:58.881 --> 35:01.316
Four minutes ago there
was a spike- very faint-

35:01.383 --> 35:02.317
sounded like a gunshot.

35:02.384 --> 35:03.518
Did Jack hear anything?

35:03.586 --> 35:05.120
No, but he's still a
quarter of a mile out.

35:05.187 --> 35:06.488
Mr. Hastings, you better take this.

35:06.556 --> 35:08.356
It's Kayla Hassan- she's in a car,
she's escaped.

35:08.424 --> 35:09.357
What?

35:09.425 --> 35:11.192
Go.

35:11.260 --> 35:13.161
Ms. Hassan, Brian Hastings,
Director of CTU.

35:13.229 --> 35:15.730
You all right? No, no,
I'm not all right.

35:15.798 --> 35:16.932
I'm driving.

35:16.999 --> 35:19.034
They might be chasing me,
I don't know.

35:19.101 --> 35:20.769
Where are you? I don't know!

35:20.836 --> 35:22.203
Track her cell phone;
patch Jack in.

35:22.271 --> 35:24.839
Ms. Hassan, we're tracking
your cell phone right now.

35:24.907 --> 35:25.907
Do not turn it off.

35:25.975 --> 35:26.975
Just tell us what happened.

35:27.043 --> 35:28.843
They tried to kill me,
but Tarin got me out.

35:28.911 --> 35:31.146
He found a car, but they caught us.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.315
They shot him.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.983
He's dead.

35:35.051 --> 35:37.552
He told me to call CTU,

35:37.620 --> 35:39.754
that it was the only safe place.

35:39.822 --> 35:41.523
Ms. Hassan, my name is Jack Bauer.

35:41.591 --> 35:43.291
We need to know where
you were being held.

35:43.359 --> 35:44.726
I don't know.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.828
Ma'am, look, I know you've
been through a great ordeal,

35:46.896 --> 35:48.930
but please, this is very important.

35:48.998 --> 35:51.399
Can you at least try to remember
what the building looked like?

35:51.467 --> 35:54.069
It was dark, and it was empty.

35:54.136 --> 35:57.405
It-It had a vault,
like a bank, but abandoned.

35:57.473 --> 35:58.440
Chloe, did you get that?

35:58.507 --> 35:59.841
Got it.

35:59.909 --> 36:03.545
You need to tell my father that
Tarin Faroush helped me escape,

36:03.613 --> 36:06.715
that he sacrificed his life for me.

36:06.782 --> 36:07.983
We've got the location, Jack.

36:08.050 --> 36:10.952
Republic Commerce Bank,
9621 East Broadway.

36:11.020 --> 36:12.253
It closed a year ago.

36:12.321 --> 36:13.622
It's the only bank on
the grid. Copy that.

36:13.689 --> 36:14.623
We're going to need drone support,

36:14.690 --> 36:15.991
and send a second
team over to the bank.

36:16.058 --> 36:18.126
We got 'em.

36:18.194 --> 36:20.528
Ms. Hassan, we've got you on
First Avenue and East Fifth.

36:20.596 --> 36:23.398
Continue going straight,
I will tell you when to turn.

36:23.466 --> 36:24.666
Okay.

36:36.579 --> 36:38.546
You two cover this exit.

36:38.614 --> 36:40.615
When the second team gets here,
you send them down.

36:40.683 --> 36:42.050
Cole, you're with me.

36:42.118 --> 36:44.486
Let's take the door.

37:23.893 --> 37:26.161
Cole.

37:59.094 --> 38:00.028
Chloe, it's Jack.

38:00.796 --> 38:02.530
We're in the basement of the bank.

38:02.598 --> 38:03.831
There's some kind of tunnel system.

38:03.899 --> 38:06.767
I've got the schematics,
I'm seeing it now.

38:06.835 --> 38:07.768
We're going to head

38:07.836 --> 38:09.804
down a spur southeast
from the vault.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.272
How many exit points?

38:11.340 --> 38:13.474
Two exits- no, three.

38:13.542 --> 38:16.477
Have the drone cover
all the exit points.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.446
Arlo, I'm sending
you my screen now.

38:18.513 --> 38:20.081
Can you get eyes on all the exits?

38:20.148 --> 38:22.717
Yeah, ascending to 5,000.

38:47.442 --> 38:50.077
I got movement at the south exit.

38:51.947 --> 38:53.881
I've got four hostiles
approaching Division Street

38:53.949 --> 38:55.216
on foot, heading northeast.

38:55.284 --> 38:57.151
You copy? Yeah.

38:57.219 --> 38:58.152
Cole, they double-backed

38:58.220 --> 38:59.453
up top.

38:59.521 --> 39:02.623
Chloe, we're moving to intercept.

39:02.691 --> 39:04.058
Where's Kayla? She's approaching

39:04.126 --> 39:06.494
the tunnel entrance now;
she'll be with us in two minutes.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.296
Security is standing by.

39:08.363 --> 39:09.697
Good work, people.

39:13.402 --> 39:15.336
Dana...

39:15.404 --> 39:16.604
good work.

39:16.672 --> 39:17.672
Thank you, sir.

39:19.908 --> 39:22.443
If you'll excuse me
for a few minutes...

39:29.051 --> 39:32.653
Targets are heading
north on Orchard.

39:32.721 --> 39:34.388
Okay, they're getting
into an SUV, Jack.

39:34.456 --> 39:35.489
Do you copy? Yeah.

39:35.557 --> 39:36.791
Just stay with them, we'll follow.

39:36.858 --> 39:38.759
Owen, King, you're coming with us.

39:38.827 --> 39:41.595
You take King's vehicle,
you two double-back around Orchard.

39:41.663 --> 39:43.664
Chloe, I've got a shot here

39:43.732 --> 39:44.899
for facial recognition.

39:44.966 --> 39:47.168
Send it to me.

39:53.508 --> 39:55.676
It's Tarin Faroush.

39:55.744 --> 39:58.079
He's supposed to be dead.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.748
Kayla said they shot him.

40:09.023 --> 40:11.859
You did the right thing, Tarin.

40:12.894 --> 40:14.862
I know.

40:14.929 --> 40:17.831
She will die for a good cause.

40:25.407 --> 40:26.441
Jack, Cole, come in.

40:26.509 --> 40:27.709
Go ahead, Chloe.

40:27.777 --> 40:28.843
We ID'd one of the targets.

40:28.911 --> 40:29.944
It's Tarin Faroush.

40:30.012 --> 40:30.979
Kayla said he sacrificed himself

40:31.046 --> 40:32.814
to save her, but he's still alive.

40:32.882 --> 40:35.049
Are you absolutely sure?

40:35.117 --> 40:36.050
Yes.

40:36.118 --> 40:37.719
What the hell's going on?

40:37.787 --> 40:39.587
The terrorists asked
us to give them a file

40:39.655 --> 40:40.655
they knew we would never give them.

40:40.723 --> 40:42.056
They never expected us to.

40:42.124 --> 40:43.358
Chloe, you got to
put Hastings on now.

40:43.425 --> 40:44.459
I'm on, Jack.

40:44.527 --> 40:46.060
You cannot let Kayla Hassan in.

40:46.128 --> 40:47.228
The terrorists faked her escape.

40:47.296 --> 40:48.663
They wanted to get her to CTU.

40:48.731 --> 40:49.664
For what purpose?

40:49.732 --> 40:50.665
What's the best way to disarm

40:50.733 --> 40:52.333
New York's radiological defenses?

40:52.651 --> 40:53.985
Taking out CTU.

40:54.053 --> 40:56.187
There's got to be something in the car,
some kind of a bomb.

40:56.255 --> 40:57.922
You need to stop her now.
Where is she?

40:58.991 --> 41:00.458
Oh, my God.

41:00.526 --> 41:02.293
She's in the tunnel.

41:02.361 --> 41:05.096
Security!

41:09.334 --> 41:10.935
Security!

41:11.970 --> 41:14.872
Dana, with me!

41:14.940 --> 41:16.774
Chloe, the car that Tarin got into,
where is it now?

41:16.842 --> 41:18.810
Crossing into Brooklyn,

41:18.877 --> 41:20.278
taking the first exit off
the Williamsburg Bridge.

41:20.345 --> 41:21.612
We cannot lose

41:21.680 --> 41:23.815
that car, do you understand me?

41:23.882 --> 41:25.083
Copy.

41:26.218 --> 41:27.385
Stop the car!

41:27.453 --> 41:29.253
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

41:29.321 --> 41:31.089
Put your hands where
we can see them!

41:31.156 --> 41:34.058
Dana, call the bomb squad!

41:34.126 --> 41:35.993
Get out of the car!

41:36.061 --> 41:37.995
Take her.

41:38.063 --> 41:40.231
Bomb squad to the tunnel entrance.

41:42.634 --> 41:43.701
Get her away from here.

41:43.769 --> 41:44.802
Hastings, have you
stopped that car?

41:44.870 --> 41:46.471
Not in time, Jack.
Hold on, just hold on.

41:49.208 --> 41:50.208
It's an EMP.

41:50.275 --> 41:52.076
It's an EMP!

41:52.144 --> 41:54.245
You need to shut down your
systems to protect the drones.

41:54.313 --> 41:55.446
There's no time, Jack.

41:57.950 --> 42:00.051
Get away from the car!
I can move it.

42:00.119 --> 42:03.287
Come on, get out of there!

42:04.189 --> 42:05.456
Get out of there!

42:13.799 --> 42:14.832
Chloe, can you hear me?

42:16.135 --> 42:17.335
Those drones right now are

42:17.402 --> 42:18.970
our only way of tracking
down those terrorists.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.005
You need to pass
them off to the NSA.

42:24.143 --> 42:25.143
Damn it, we're blind.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.577
Chloe, did you cop... Chloe?!

42:26.645 --> 42:27.845
What the hell is happening?

42:27.913 --> 42:30.581
We need to contact NSA.

42:30.649 --> 42:32.583
The terrorists just took out CTU.

42:32.584 --> 42:38.584
