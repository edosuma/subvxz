00:00.960 --> 00:02.257
Previously on
crisis...

00:02.260 --> 00:04.922
(distorted voice):
You can have five kids
right now.

00:04.930 --> 00:06.795
We only need one thing from you:

00:06.800 --> 00:08.836
Secret service agent
marcus finley.

00:08.840 --> 00:12.162
Hrt commander: _
We do have laser trip wrres.

00:13.810 --> 00:15.402
They were ready for us.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.444
Send the kids, I'm here!
Send the kids now.

00:18.450 --> 00:21.476
Dunn:
There. That’s g/bson,
there with the hostages.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.277
He’s not the one
doing the talk/77g.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.212
What about finley?

00:27.220 --> 00:28.653
For now?

00:28.660 --> 00:29.809
He's on his own.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.526
This is swat secure 28-19.

00:32.530 --> 00:35.294
I am on online and request
radio check of all units.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.619
How'd you get
her in there?

00:36.630 --> 00:37.858
She's one
of them.

00:37.870 --> 00:38.962
She's a cop.

00:38.970 --> 00:41.165
If my dad says
he has a plan,

00:41.170 --> 00:42.797
Then he has
a plan.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.459
This is what happens
when you say "no"

00:44.470 --> 00:46.802
To our demands,
mr. President...

00:46.810 --> 00:49.301
(gunshot, francis groans)

00:49.310 --> 00:50.971
A hostage was just released.

00:50.980 --> 00:51.969
I'm standing here

00:51.980 --> 00:53.572
With amber fitch.

00:53.580 --> 00:54.808
She'd very much like

00:54.820 --> 00:57.038
To speak to her mother.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.616
(cloth tearing)

01:01.820 --> 01:04.209
(panﬁng)

01:04.230 --> 01:07.085
You're losing a lot of blood.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.318
So it would seem.
Was this arranged,

01:09.330 --> 01:11.525
Or did your men turn on you?
You were there.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.724
What'd you see?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.093
I saw you take
a bullet for kyle.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.738
Ah!
Now you tell me
if they're really

01:15.740 --> 01:17.935
Gonna kill him, or was this
just for the cameras?

01:17.940 --> 01:20.306
I don't know, agent finley!

01:21.340 --> 01:23.308
(panﬁng)

01:31.520 --> 01:34.080
Look, if he doesn't get
proper medical attention,

01:34.090 --> 01:35.455
He'll die soon.

01:35.460 --> 01:37.758
Within the hour,
the fbi'll sling his hero ass

01:37.760 --> 01:39.489
On a medevac chopper.

01:41.030 --> 01:42.850
It's time to save tory hurst.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.589
Repeat, time to save tory hurst.

01:46.870 --> 01:48.269
Hello, 911?

01:48.270 --> 01:50.795
There's a girl crying
in the apartment upstairs,

01:50.810 --> 01:52.038
All day and night.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.860
The man who lives there
has no children.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.472
Can you send someone?

01:57.880 --> 02:00.576
She's the daughter of that
dead secret service agent.

02:00.580 --> 02:02.138
Yes, she is.

02:02.150 --> 02:03.572
And she's not here.
No, she's not.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.888
So, what does she have
to do with our escape?

02:05.890 --> 02:07.209
You know, I know
being a scientist

02:07.220 --> 02:08.482
Makes you curious, but stop

02:08.490 --> 02:11.129
Asking questions.
Go get that gear on.

02:13.660 --> 02:15.298
It's time to go.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.052
I have two black hawks inbound.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.219
30 minutes out, 16 men.

02:19.770 --> 02:22.068
Fast rope to the roof--
45 seconds later, it's over.

02:22.070 --> 02:23.833
And if the roof
is rigged?

02:23.840 --> 02:25.307
That's the risk.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.460
Do it. Get them
out of there.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.175
Clarenbach:
FranCIs was always
a one for checklists.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.943
"is," doc, not "was."

02:34.950 --> 02:37.248
He's not dead.

02:40.490 --> 02:42.253
Go start the fire
in the east wing.

02:42.260 --> 02:45.184
When you smell smoke, count 30,
deactivate the mines.

02:45.190 --> 02:47.658
Both of you follow doc
and I into the tunnels.

02:47.660 --> 02:51.323
She'll have a humvee waiting
for us on the other side.

02:52.330 --> 02:54.639
And we're free
and away.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.596
And the kids?

02:56.610 --> 02:58.259
And gibson?

02:58.270 --> 03:01.273
Look, I know, I'm sorry,
but you're torching the place

03:01.280 --> 03:02.929
And he is still locked up.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.101
He escapes, saves the kids...

03:06.120 --> 03:08.873
And it's a happy ending
kind of story.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.609
They're coming now.
The fbi.

03:10.620 --> 03:13.009
After that show
you put on upstairs,

03:13.020 --> 03:14.658
They'll come, mines or not.

03:14.660 --> 03:16.116
Then they'll all die.
The kids, too.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.483
The house is rigged!

03:17.490 --> 03:18.627
(panﬁng)

03:18.630 --> 03:20.279
The coal chute over
there is painted shut.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.029
If you can get
in there...

03:22.030 --> 03:23.292
(panﬁng)

03:23.300 --> 03:25.860
...Maybe you can get out
and save them.

03:25.870 --> 03:27.064
I'm supposed to believe that?

03:27.070 --> 03:28.298
Believe whatever
you want,

03:28.300 --> 03:30.131
But I'm dying,

03:30.140 --> 03:32.529
So it's up to you.

03:35.140 --> 03:37.131
Vehicle's in position.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.674
Be advised, black hawks
are 20 minutes out.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.841
Koz:
We're three minutes
from the burn,

03:40.850 --> 03:43.410
And we'll be gone by then.

03:43.420 --> 03:45.479
I'm gonna scrub these computers.

03:46.990 --> 03:48.184
Hey.

03:48.190 --> 03:50.909
You ready for tahiti?

03:50.930 --> 03:52.579
Wait a minute.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.989
This isn't right.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.627
Dutton:
What?

03:58.200 --> 04:00.828
(tapping key)

04:00.840 --> 04:03.229
This can't be right.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.333
Stand by. Change of plans.

04:05.340 --> 04:07.308
(alarm beeping)

04:10.550 --> 04:13.348
Get gibson.
He's coming with us.

04:13.350 --> 04:15.841
Those weren't
the orders.
They are now.

04:16.450 --> 04:17.849
I got one thing to do,

04:17.850 --> 04:19.909
And then we're gonna
meet in the tunnels.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.016
And the kids?
If gibson's with you,

04:23.030 --> 04:24.588
Who's gonna save them
from the fire?

04:24.590 --> 04:25.522
Not my problem.

04:25.530 --> 04:27.384
My contract's been broken.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.890
I'll get you
out of here.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.664
You can come with us, but
then you're on your own.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.303
We have fire on the eastern side
of the mansron, snr.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.039
Upper floors,
spreading fast.

04:49.050 --> 04:50.870
_ Black_hawks?
Eight minutes out.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.118
Any sign
of finley?

04:52.120 --> 04:54.714
(panﬁng)

04:54.720 --> 04:55.880
(groans)

04:55.890 --> 04:58.381
Smoke.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.278
Who set the fire?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.636
You, stay back.

05:10.170 --> 05:11.307
Over there.

05:15.310 --> 05:17.437
What are you doing?

05:17.450 --> 05:19.099
You're coming
with me.
No!

05:19.110 --> 05:20.475
Stop! You can't
take me!

05:20.480 --> 05:22.243
I need to be with my daughter!

05:22.250 --> 05:24.115
No! No...
Finley, help.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.918
I'm not playing this
game, mr. Gibson.
I don't believe you.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.549
(groans)
you want my help,
you tell the truth.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.196
I did it.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.827
I made those calls.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.147
(kids shouting, screaming)
help us!

05:53.150 --> 05:54.947
Help!

05:54.950 --> 05:56.269
(coughin
help! 9)

05:56.290 --> 05:58.781
Come on.
(panﬁng)

05:58.790 --> 06:00.485
Stay against
the wall.

06:00.490 --> 06:03.357
What are you doing?

06:03.360 --> 06:06.420
I'll see you later, mr. Gibson.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.028
(gunshot)

06:16.400 --> 06:18.436
(grunting, choking)

06:29.320 --> 06:31.743
(panﬁng)

06:35.060 --> 06:37.858
That was the truth,
wasn't it?

06:37.860 --> 06:39.725
How can you be sure?

06:39.730 --> 06:41.823
Because you weren't
talking like

06:41.830 --> 06:43.957
A hero trying to
save all the kids.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.593
What was I talking like?

06:48.900 --> 06:50.197
Like a father

06:50.210 --> 06:52.735
Terrified of losing
his daughter.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.362
Kyle!

07:18.370 --> 07:20.497
Kyle:
I'm here!

07:22.540 --> 07:25.031
Do you know where
the kids are?

07:25.040 --> 07:27.008
They're in the bedrooms.
They're zip-tied together.

07:33.210 --> 07:34.438
Take this.

07:34.450 --> 07:36.270
Cut them loose. Get them
to the front door...

07:36.290 --> 07:38.884
What?
...And ready to
run for it.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.812
Kyle.

07:40.820 --> 07:41.889
You can do this.

07:41.890 --> 07:43.482
Whatever hurst was,
I know he taught you

07:43.490 --> 07:45.128
How to act when
things go bad.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.553
Focus on what
you need to do

07:47.560 --> 07:49.050
And where you
need to be.

07:49.060 --> 07:51.460
You can do this.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.098
Tell me.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.795
I can do this.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.804
Fire is spreading to all floors.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.801
My choppers are
four minutes out.

08:05.910 --> 08:08.640
(gibson gasping)

08:13.290 --> 08:16.111
(both coughing)

08:16.120 --> 08:18.520
What do we do?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.795
Everything's gone.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.028
What do we do?!

08:24.030 --> 08:26.590
(groans)

08:26.600 --> 08:29.194
Gotta... Check the
status of the...

08:29.200 --> 08:30.690
Status of
the mines.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.099
Where?
Here.
Here, here.

08:33.110 --> 08:34.361
Open that.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.530
Francis:
What does it say?
Finley: Armed.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.768
(groans)
the_ mines are
still armed.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.475
Okay, how do we
turn them off?

08:40.480 --> 08:43.017
How do we
turn them off?

08:43.020 --> 08:44.578
Gibson!

08:47.290 --> 08:48.951
(kids shouting)

08:48.960 --> 08:50.484
Gibson, listen to me.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.287
How do I turn
off the mines?

08:52.290 --> 08:53.621
You want to save beth ann?

08:53.630 --> 08:55.393
How do I turn off the mines?

08:55.400 --> 08:57.129
Ian: Help us!
Somebody help us!

08:57.130 --> 08:58.791
(coughing)

08:58.800 --> 08:59.789
Kyle.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.199
We have to get
everyone out.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.736
They've got us
in both bedrooms.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.059
Okay. This
one first.
Yeah.

09:04.070 --> 09:06.265
(coughs)

09:15.650 --> 09:17.743
They were shutting it all down.

09:18.650 --> 09:20.481
(helicopters whirring)

09:20.490 --> 09:22.879
No. Not yet.

09:22.890 --> 09:24.084
Not yet!

09:24.090 --> 09:27.127
Black hawk pilot:
We are on station and ready.

09:35.170 --> 09:36.330
I recognize this.

09:36.340 --> 09:38.763
Dedicated police terminal.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.099
You were using cops?

09:46.350 --> 09:49.114
(coughing)

09:50.850 --> 09:52.647
(typing)

10:05.700 --> 10:07.588
Sir. Something you need to see.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.760
This is a dedicated

10:08.770 --> 10:10.738
Police terminal,
not internet linked.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.435
They use radio signals to
communicate with each other.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.600
Go on.

10:13.610 --> 10:15.578
I think your man
inside the mansion

10:15.580 --> 10:18.708
Is on the other end of this one.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.970
Hold those choppers.

10:20.980 --> 10:24.848
How do we know that's finley
and not the kidnapper?

10:32.560 --> 10:34.619
(coughs)

10:37.100 --> 10:38.158
It's finley.

10:38.170 --> 10:41.162
"where is gibson?"

10:44.640 --> 10:46.835
Olsen:
Get bomb squad on this

10:46.840 --> 10:50.139
So they can walk finley through
what he needs to do.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.908
Hrt commander:
Laser trip Wires
are still armed.

11:00.590 --> 11:02.080
(coughs)

11:02.090 --> 11:05.651
Great. Tech support.

11:25.610 --> 11:27.373
His kid, gibson's kid.

11:27.380 --> 11:29.268
Try-try the password "beth ann."

11:53.170 --> 11:55.877
(coughing)

12:21.240 --> 12:23.060
"hey, tahiti,
I know you're out there.

12:23.070 --> 12:25.106
"whatever you've done,
I don't think you signed up

12:25.110 --> 12:27.908
To let these kids
burn to death."

12:27.910 --> 12:30.834
Who the hell is tahiti?

12:32.910 --> 12:36.573
Koz:
We're out of the building.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.546
Do you read me?

12:38.550 --> 12:41.189
We're in the tunnel and three
minutes from extraction p0int.

12:41.190 --> 12:42.418
Dutton:
Copy.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.354
We're going out
right beneath them.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.679
Gibson thinks of everything.

12:45.690 --> 12:46.952
Almost everything.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.520
It's time for you to get out.

12:49.530 --> 12:52.021
Do you copy?

12:53.430 --> 12:56.137
Do you copy?

13:04.450 --> 13:07.169
(computer beeping)

13:13.490 --> 13:14.889
Who sent that message?

13:14.890 --> 13:16.653
Terminal reads as unidentified.

13:16.660 --> 13:18.821
How many of those
do we have here?

13:18.830 --> 13:20.718
Including the mobile units
on-site, tactical,

13:20.730 --> 13:23.221
And the command center here,
maybe 50.

13:23.230 --> 13:25.869
I'm on it.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.575
_ Hrt_commander:
Trip Wires deactivated.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.798
Okay, go! Send them all.

14:10.610 --> 14:13.602
(door crashes)

14:13.620 --> 14:15.099
(garbled radio transmission)

14:15.120 --> 14:19.079
_ Hrt me_mber:
Negative. Clearing bedrooms.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.223
Agent finley, secret service.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.290
Where are the kids?

14:34.300 --> 14:35.961
Have you found the kids?

14:35.970 --> 14:37.790
This is gray four.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.459
We have finley, plus one.

14:39.470 --> 14:41.062
Do we have the hostages?

14:41.080 --> 14:43.605
_ Man:
We're taking them out now.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.869
(cheering, applause)

14:53.890 --> 14:55.016
They're at the front.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.510
We're taking them out
right now.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.056
We'll take him.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.880
No.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.993
I got him.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.677
Dunn: You okay?
Finley: Just a little
smoke inhalation.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.773
I got something to do
before I take care of that.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.246
Whoever responded
to my messages

15:26.250 --> 15:28.411
Was a genuine law
enforcement officer.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.684
It makes sense.
The kidnappers have been messing

15:30.690 --> 15:32.385
With our communications
from the start.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.086
They turned one
of our own people.

15:36.530 --> 15:38.293
You called him tahiti. Why?

15:38.300 --> 15:40.768
There was a postcard taped to
the back of the police terminal.

15:40.770 --> 15:43.091
Where he's going
after this, I bet.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.533
Not yet.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.360
But where's he been?

15:46.370 --> 15:47.928
If he's been in there
helping them,

15:47.940 --> 15:49.532
Then he hasn't been
at his regular job.

15:49.540 --> 15:52.703
We're looking for somebody
who's been away on leave.

15:52.710 --> 15:54.143
And who _came back
Just in time to be

15:54.150 --> 15:56.038
Gibson's eyes and
ears here in icc

15:56.050 --> 15:58.416
While we had
him surrounded.

15:58.420 --> 16:00.911
We need to find him.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.559
We can't use anyone here.
I'll call hq.

16:15.740 --> 16:18.459
Communications specialist,
maryland state trooper.

16:18.470 --> 16:20.961
Came back from leave
just to work this standoff.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.301
Where does she sit?
Right over there.

16:31.750 --> 16:34.389
Dutton-- where is she?

16:37.260 --> 16:39.421
(garbled radio transmissions)

16:39.430 --> 16:42.024
We're clear.

16:43.160 --> 16:46.664
That's one thing
that went right.

17:19.130 --> 17:20.290
Ma'am, you can't
go back there.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.790
I'm looking for my daughter.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.189
Her name's amber.
Amber ﬁtch.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.359
I'm sure she'll be out soon.

17:25.370 --> 17:27.804
They told me I could
see her hours ago.

17:27.810 --> 17:29.175
She was released
before the others.

17:29.180 --> 17:30.579
Why isn't she out here?

17:30.580 --> 17:31.808
What's happened to her?

17:31.810 --> 17:34.699
I will find out.
Just wait here?

17:35.380 --> 17:37.416
Why is amber
still in medical?

17:37.420 --> 17:40.139
I don't know.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.727
Please come with me.

17:50.430 --> 17:52.921
All of these children
went through something.

17:52.930 --> 17:54.591
But something different
happened to her.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.931
What?

17:55.940 --> 17:58.158
Your daughter tried to
leave the medical tent

17:58.170 --> 17:59.501
And head back to the mansion.

17:59.510 --> 18:03.674
She fought the agents
who tried to stop her.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.843
We sedated her,
but she's

18:06.850 --> 18:08.101
Awake now.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.769
I can bring you to her.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.382
Susie, I...

18:18.390 --> 18:21.951
Maybe now is not the right time
to meet her aunt susie.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.793
Soon.

18:26.870 --> 18:29.088
(clears throat)

18:29.100 --> 18:30.590
Did you see her?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.566
No, but, uh, but she...

18:32.570 --> 18:34.060
She's alive.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.208
Yeah. She's alive.

18:37.210 --> 18:39.144
Finley, you got
the kids back.

18:39.150 --> 18:42.119
We got the kids.

18:45.550 --> 18:48.917
Fire's been knocked down, teams
are searching the building.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.956
We'll know soon how many
survivors we have.

18:50.960 --> 18:51.984
Will we?

18:51.990 --> 18:54.424
We have an apb
out on dutton,

18:54.430 --> 18:56.455
But we never had a head
count on the kidnappers.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.223
These people have
a plan for everything.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.323
What was their
plan for you?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.900
Me? I was the star witness
for the gibson show.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.731
I could testify
that he was treated

19:04.740 --> 19:06.230
Just like any other hostage.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.561
That I saw him abused,
that he took a bullet

19:08.580 --> 19:09.638
To save lqle.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.232
But something went wrong.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.945
Gibson's people turned on him.

19:12.950 --> 19:14.474
He was desperate and scared.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.074
He admitted to me
that he was the kidnapper.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.409
So, why isn't he under arrest?

19:18.420 --> 19:19.739
Can't use the confession.

19:19.750 --> 19:20.944
He had a gun to his head.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.757
Well, they may
have turned on him,

19:22.760 --> 19:24.250
But he came out of there a hero

19:24.260 --> 19:26.751
_ Who almost died
savmg the pre5ident's son.

19:26.760 --> 19:30.423
And we don't have a single piece
of hard evidence against him.

19:30.430 --> 19:31.692
Olsen:
Where IS g/hson now?

19:31.700 --> 19:33.122
Finley:
Stab/h'zeo’.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.769
They’re about
to move him for surgery.

19:35.770 --> 19:38.193
(monitor beeping steadily)

19:52.150 --> 19:54.118
Woman (over tv):
We go now to the president

19:54.120 --> 19:56.281
As he reunites
with his son kyle.

19:56.290 --> 19:59.384
We've been waiting for this
moment for quite some time,

19:59.390 --> 20:02.120
As americ_a has tuned in
to this tragedy

20:02.130 --> 20:04.519
Regarding the ballard
high school kidnapping.

20:04.530 --> 20:07.397
There are reports that
francis gibson took a bullet

20:07.400 --> 20:08.992
For young lqle
and saved his life.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.888
We can only imagine

20:10.910 --> 20:13.367
What must be going through
the president's mind,

20:13.370 --> 20:17.374
As he realizes the dangerous
situation his son was in.

20:18.580 --> 20:21.299
...The whole nation has watched
unfold right in front of us,

20:21.320 --> 20:23.515
Heightened only by the fact
that it was, you know,

20:23.520 --> 20:27.581
The sons of very wealthy
and important businessmen...

20:27.590 --> 20:29.785
(sobbing quietly)

20:35.600 --> 20:37.727
It's okay, janice.
Don't worry.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.322
I'll be all right.

20:39.330 --> 20:41.798
Just go be with beth ann.

20:43.670 --> 20:45.729
(crying):
Beth ann didn't come out.

20:45.740 --> 20:47.958
She's missing.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.407
No, that's impossible.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.454
After an anonymous tip led
to the rescue of tory hurst,

21:04.460 --> 21:05.779
Eight-year-old daughter

21:05.790 --> 21:08.350
Of slain secret service agent
albert hurst,

21:08.360 --> 21:10.191
Her suspected abductor,
thomas jefferson smith,

21:10.200 --> 21:13.124
Has been apprehended.

21:13.130 --> 21:15.269
A disgruntled former cia agent,

21:15.270 --> 21:17.261
He is suspected
to be the mastermind

21:17.270 --> 21:19.431
Behind the ballard kidnapping.

21:19.440 --> 21:22.739
The fbi displayed further proof
of this when money tied

21:22.740 --> 21:26.608
To a ransom had been found
connected to jefferson smith.

21:27.310 --> 21:30.313
Dunn:
How's jail?

21:30.320 --> 21:32.208
I'm getting by.

21:32.220 --> 21:35.712
Getting by
but never getting out.

21:36.820 --> 21:39.618
We tied tory hurst to you
and that ransom money.

21:39.630 --> 21:42.224
Guess that means you're the
ballard kidnapping mastermind.

21:42.230 --> 21:45.393
Oh, come on. We know
who tied the hurst girl

21:45.400 --> 21:47.493
And the money to me.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.229
You mean francis gibson.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.492
I didn't think he had
it in him, actually.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.661
I didn't see that when
I was training him.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.308
But you don't really have
anything on him now, do you?

21:57.310 --> 21:59.904
I mean, he kind of
came out of there clean.

21:59.910 --> 22:01.502
A hero, actually.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.442
But now his daughter
is missing.

22:03.450 --> 22:05.918
Uh-huh. I haven't
seen her.

22:05.920 --> 22:09.151
What about your boss widener?
Did he have her taken?

22:09.160 --> 22:11.014
Does widener want gibson
to do something

22:11.030 --> 22:12.759
To get her back?
Oh, hell, no.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.957
I'd hate to see
what francis gibson would do

22:15.960 --> 22:18.451
To get his own daughter back.

22:18.470 --> 22:19.994
Be kind of messy, actually.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.161
Did widener have beth ann taken?

22:22.170 --> 22:25.333
I don't know gabe widener.
Sorry.

22:25.340 --> 22:28.605
And my advice
on gibson?

22:28.610 --> 22:32.603
You either arrest him,
you kill him...

22:32.610 --> 22:35.443
Or you find his daughter.

22:36.350 --> 22:39.046
He's way too dangerous
for anything else.

22:39.950 --> 22:42.009
(laughs)

22:45.730 --> 22:48.358
Beth ann:
Daddy? Daddy, help me.

22:48.360 --> 22:51.090
Daddy, please?

22:52.900 --> 22:55.994
Beth ann. Beth ann?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.468
Please, just do what they want.

22:58.470 --> 23:00.802
Who are they? Who has you?

23:00.810 --> 23:02.004
(line clicks)

23:02.010 --> 23:03.671
Reporter: Authorities
are still asking for help

23:03.680 --> 23:05.136
In locating the whereabouts

23:05.150 --> 23:08.472
Of this woman, maryland state
trooper alicia dutton,

23:08.480 --> 23:10.914
In relation to the ballard
school kidnapping.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.411
She is thought to have taken
the last remaining hostage,

23:13.420 --> 23:15.479
Beth ann gibson.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.651
Maintenance guy thinks he saw
dutton around four hours ago.

23:19.660 --> 23:23.391
Remember, she's a cop.
She will not go quietly.

23:32.340 --> 23:34.661
All clear.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.206
Living in this dump
wasn't the plan.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.438
She didn't expect
to be here.

23:39.450 --> 23:40.599
Something went wrong.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.576
There were two people
at that table.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.514
Maybe she's running

23:44.520 --> 23:48.081
With gibson's number two,
the redhead.

23:51.290 --> 23:53.019
They left in a hurry.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.465
Someone was taped down
to this bed.

24:02.940 --> 24:04.828
Dunn.

24:09.910 --> 24:11.707
They're scared.

24:11.710 --> 24:13.246
Do you know
why they're scared?

24:13.250 --> 24:14.205
VVho?

24:14.220 --> 24:16.142
Your two ex-employees.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.641
The people who took
your daughter.

24:18.650 --> 24:20.584
Dunn: They're scared because
they don't have you

24:20.590 --> 24:22.581
And your plans anymore.

24:22.590 --> 24:25.388
No more mansions,
no more downed drones.

24:25.390 --> 24:28.223
Now it's your daughter
taped to a bed.

24:28.230 --> 24:30.949
Dunn:
Your crew turned on you. Why?

24:30.970 --> 24:34.394
Did someone get to them?

24:34.400 --> 24:36.391
I don't have a crew,
agent dunn.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.958
You admitted to me
you were the kidnapper.

24:37.970 --> 24:40.632
Come clean on record,
help us find your daughter.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.803
What I said to you in the fire,
you thought I was the kidnapper.

24:43.810 --> 24:45.471
I knew the
only way to get

24:45.480 --> 24:47.903
Your help was to give
you a false confession.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.944
I'd lie to you again

24:48.950 --> 24:50.577
If it meant
beth ann's safe return.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.478
But I can't tell you
what I don't know.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.515
You know they took beth arm
to use you.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.454
What do they want you to do?

24:56.460 --> 24:57.688
I don't know!

24:57.690 --> 24:59.578
You're the powerful parent now,

24:59.590 --> 25:02.923
Just like the parents
you used.

25:02.930 --> 25:04.625
Did you get a call?

25:04.630 --> 25:08.760
No, the fbi escort's been
outside my door since I woke up.

25:08.770 --> 25:11.136
Going home now?
Yes, to see my wife.

25:11.140 --> 25:15.008
Big reunion. Nice of her
to let you back in the house.

25:15.010 --> 25:18.207
But you're the hero now.
What choice does she have?

25:28.690 --> 25:31.887
What does francis gibson do
to get his daughter back?

25:38.670 --> 25:41.161
Press is at the house...

25:41.170 --> 25:43.161
All the time.

25:43.170 --> 25:45.297
I'm sorry.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.301
The fbi still
follows me.

25:47.310 --> 25:48.732
Because of beth ann.

25:48.740 --> 25:51.903
Why are we the only ones?

25:51.910 --> 25:55.107
Why is beth ann
the only one still lost?

25:56.580 --> 25:58.616
(phone ringing)

26:01.190 --> 26:03.215
You gonna pick it up?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.049
Hello.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.889
Just tell me what you want.
Just say it!

26:18.340 --> 26:19.364
Who was that?

26:19.370 --> 26:21.361
I don't know.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.608
Was it widener?

26:22.610 --> 26:24.407
I said I don't know.

26:24.410 --> 26:26.344
You need to stay away from him.

26:26.350 --> 26:27.544
You don't know him.

26:27.550 --> 26:30.348
He-he threatened
our daughter's life.

26:30.350 --> 26:31.419
I don't believe that.

26:31.420 --> 26:33.342
You need to trust me, janice.

26:33.350 --> 26:35.341
Trust?

26:35.360 --> 26:38.056
Okay, trust.

26:38.060 --> 26:41.382
Tell me, do you know
who the kidnapper is, francis?

26:41.400 --> 26:44.858
They caught the man
who did that.

26:44.870 --> 26:46.963
What did you tell me
about your business?

26:46.970 --> 26:48.722
"it's never the men you see,
it's always the men you don't."

26:48.740 --> 26:50.537
You need to trust me now.

26:50.540 --> 26:52.838
I promise you
I will get her back.

26:54.410 --> 26:56.628
Tell me, did they ask you
to do something?

26:56.640 --> 26:58.278
Have you gotten a call?

27:02.980 --> 27:06.040
No, francis.

27:06.050 --> 27:07.881
Have you?

27:17.400 --> 27:20.563
The paper you found where they
were holding beth ann gibson

27:20.570 --> 27:22.834
Still had a few words on it.

27:23.900 --> 27:27.631
Finley: What's gonna
self-destruct on Sunday?

27:29.280 --> 27:31.373
(phone ringing)

27:33.580 --> 27:37.072
Beth ann:
Daddy? Daddy, help me.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.117
Beth ann, who has you?

27:40.120 --> 27:43.180
Man (distorted): Francis gibson,
you need to ask yourself

27:46.030 --> 27:49.488
You know
they're tapping my phone.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.355
You know we can get around that.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.122
What do you want?

27:54.140 --> 27:56.631
Not yet. Tomorrow,
you'll do something

27:56.640 --> 27:59.268
Even you could not
have imagined.

27:59.270 --> 28:01.101
Let me talk to widener.

28:01.110 --> 28:04.329
Tomorrow, francis.
And then you get beth ann back.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.430
(line clicks)

28:05.450 --> 28:08.044
What do they
want you to do?

28:15.790 --> 28:18.179
Sir, there's an anomaly
on the gibson house phone tap.

28:18.190 --> 28:20.329
What kind of anomaly?

28:20.330 --> 28:21.627
73 seconds of pure static.

28:21.630 --> 28:23.188
Play it.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.259
(static crackling)

28:27.800 --> 28:28.994
When was this?
An hour ago.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.729
We didn't pick it
up in real time.

28:30.740 --> 28:34.039
Only when we reviewed
and filtered the tapes.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.302
That's it.

28:35.310 --> 28:37.801
That was gibson getting
the kidnappers' call.

28:37.810 --> 28:42.201
Contact gibson's handlers
and find him right now.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.547
You need to let me in.

28:45.550 --> 28:46.847
Why would I do that?

28:46.850 --> 28:48.818
I have something for you.

28:48.820 --> 28:51.414
The reason why your daughter's
so much more broken

28:51.430 --> 28:53.125
Than the others.

28:54.660 --> 28:56.992
Bring him in.

29:00.570 --> 29:02.561
They're reporting
that he's moved positions.

29:02.570 --> 29:05.391
Dunn, gibson is
at your sister's house.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.535
What do you want from me
that you're offering information

29:11.550 --> 29:13.347
About my daughter's
state of mind?

29:13.350 --> 29:15.170
Widener's going to use me.

29:15.180 --> 29:18.377
I would guess
in some way against you.

29:18.390 --> 29:21.086
He hates the both of us.
Maybe we could help each other.

29:21.090 --> 29:22.751
You want us to work together?

29:22.760 --> 29:25.354
I want my daughter.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.988
I see.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.052
All right, mr. Gibson,

29:31.070 --> 29:33.868
You first.

29:33.870 --> 29:37.260
Why don't you tell me
what you know about amber.

29:37.270 --> 29:39.761
You know the teacher died
in there?

29:39.770 --> 29:42.034
Yes, mr. Nash.

29:43.980 --> 29:45.902
They were, uh, intimate,

29:45.910 --> 29:49.710
The teacher
and your daughter.

29:49.720 --> 29:52.780
No one knew. I could see it.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.217
She was in a relationship

29:55.220 --> 29:57.984
With the man who died
in her arms.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.383
You didn't know,
did you?

30:01.400 --> 30:07.794
So sorry for what this must
make you feel as her mother.

30:10.770 --> 30:12.328
But we had a bargain.

30:12.340 --> 30:14.228
Now you-- gabe widener.

30:14.240 --> 30:17.073
Widener called me...

30:18.610 --> 30:21.545
...To see if I'd help him
find your money.

30:24.150 --> 30:26.015
I declined.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.988
Why?

30:27.990 --> 30:30.686
Because you killed that boy.

30:30.690 --> 30:33.750
And after you killed that boy,
all I wanted was amber back

30:33.760 --> 30:37.196
So I could protect her,
away from you.

30:38.930 --> 30:41.922
Did you kill him yourself,
mr. Gibson?

30:42.770 --> 30:45.261
Or did you have
somebody else do it?

30:45.270 --> 30:49.673
What does widener want
with the kidnappers' money?

30:49.680 --> 30:51.602
Turn your men against you.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.475
Itakeitthats
happened.

30:53.480 --> 30:54.947
I said
I wouldn't help,

30:54.950 --> 30:58.374
But now I wish
that I had.

30:58.390 --> 31:01.939
I wonder what he'll make you do
to get your daughter back.

31:03.390 --> 31:05.779
I'd have a long list.

31:05.790 --> 31:08.520
And it would end
with you begging.

31:08.530 --> 31:10.088
(door opens)

31:14.030 --> 31:15.566
Mr. Gibson was just leaving.

31:15.570 --> 31:18.630
What's going to self-destruct
on Sunday, mr. Gibson?

31:18.640 --> 31:19.959
You're hurting me,
agent finley.

31:19.970 --> 31:23.133
Did you receive
a call?

31:23.140 --> 31:24.573
You're tapping my phone.

31:24.580 --> 31:25.808
You heard it-- static.

31:25.810 --> 31:27.698
I just want them
to tell me what to do,

31:27.720 --> 31:29.540
And all I heard was static.

31:32.220 --> 31:34.882
You're not gonna
find her, are you?

31:37.190 --> 31:40.489
I'd like my fbi escort
to take me home now.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.151
He wanted to
know if I...

31:46.170 --> 31:48.764
Helped widener
take his money.

31:48.770 --> 31:50.397
Why did you
let him in?

31:50.400 --> 31:53.904
I needed to see if
I could look at him.

31:53.910 --> 31:56.902
If I was
strong enough.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.008
We need to search
this place.

32:00.010 --> 32:02.046
There's been a threat.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.018
You need to leave
until it's clear.

32:04.020 --> 32:06.386
I'll go get amber.

32:06.390 --> 32:08.950
How is she?

32:11.860 --> 32:15.250
Why don't you come
see for yourself.

32:31.880 --> 32:35.043
Still won't
talk about it?

32:35.050 --> 32:37.439
Not a word of what
went on in there.

32:37.450 --> 32:40.283
Just this.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.354
You're not gonna
get gibson, are you?

32:45.990 --> 32:48.959
He'll get away
with it.

32:56.570 --> 32:58.993
Amber.

33:01.470 --> 33:04.132
Your aunt
su5ie's here.

33:13.690 --> 33:15.578
Uh...

33:15.590 --> 33:18.309
May I?

33:19.930 --> 33:22.057
Sure.

33:23.630 --> 33:25.120
I'm making
one for each

33:25.130 --> 33:26.666
Of my classmates.

33:26.670 --> 33:28.319
You used your yearbook.

33:34.970 --> 33:37.939
It's a funny way for us
to finally meet, huh?

33:37.950 --> 33:39.474
Yeah.

33:39.480 --> 33:42.108
Guess so.

33:45.020 --> 33:46.510
You're the one

33:46.520 --> 33:48.511
Who found us?

33:49.790 --> 33:51.678
One of the agents.

33:51.690 --> 33:53.282
Yeah.

33:54.330 --> 33:57.197
How come it took you so long?

33:58.360 --> 34:02.262
How come you left us in there
for so long?

34:13.680 --> 34:16.308
She's strong.
She'll heal.

34:17.980 --> 34:19.743
How do you know that?

34:19.750 --> 34:21.980
I know her mother.

34:21.990 --> 34:24.379
She’s
strong.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.558
What if this is all
still gibson?

34:28.560 --> 34:30.596
It's not.

34:31.530 --> 34:33.168
Because he got
everything he wanted

34:33.170 --> 34:34.489
Except his daughter.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.731
Someone is going
to use him this time.

34:39.370 --> 34:41.235
It's after midnight.
Tomorrow is Sunday.

34:41.240 --> 34:44.175
That piece of paper said
"self-destruct, Sunday."

34:44.180 --> 34:46.569
We have less than
24 hours.

34:46.580 --> 34:47.672
We have to find

34:47.680 --> 34:48.908
Beth ann and we have to find

34:48.920 --> 34:50.069
The people that have her.

34:50.080 --> 34:53.743
I got an idea about that.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.780
To have come through
what you both have

35:02.800 --> 35:04.756
And for it still
not to be over...

35:04.770 --> 35:06.294
I can't imagine.
Do you have

35:06.300 --> 35:08.291
Anything to say to the people
who have your daughter?

35:08.300 --> 35:11.895
Actually, I have something
to say to them.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.400
Agent finley.

35:13.410 --> 35:17.301
The true hero,
the man who saved my life.

35:17.310 --> 35:18.538
Please.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.745
Do you mind?

35:20.750 --> 35:22.342
No. Please, go ahead.

35:23.920 --> 35:26.047
I am speaking to alicia dutton,

35:26.050 --> 35:28.712
The woman who has
beth ann gibson.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.982
The cop who helped me

35:29.990 --> 35:32.811
Save those kids in that fire.

35:32.830 --> 35:34.422
We know who you are.

35:34.430 --> 35:37.228
We know your name,
your face,

35:37.230 --> 35:38.549
Where you grew up.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.925
We know your friends
and your family.

35:40.930 --> 35:43.694
You're burned; you know that.

35:50.610 --> 35:52.737
Dunn:
The interview starts at 8:00.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.149
Finley's on six minutes in.

35:54.150 --> 35:56.277
Call comes in, we trace it
and hit it hard.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.145
30 seconds
from start.

36:13.430 --> 36:16.092
Don't get too attached to her.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.136
Come on,
gibson's gonna be on tv.

36:18.140 --> 36:20.529
I'll get us a couple beers.

36:26.850 --> 36:28.670
Reporter:
Can I ask...

36:28.680 --> 36:30.545
You were living apart
before this happened.

36:30.550 --> 36:34.008
Has this brought you
together in some way?

36:34.020 --> 36:37.456
We're her parents--
beth ann's--

36:37.460 --> 36:38.882
And we want her to know

36:38.890 --> 36:40.949
That we are here
waiting for her.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.052
That we are here together.

36:42.060 --> 36:44.620
Light or regular?
Ught

36:44.630 --> 36:46.996
Reporter:
To have come through
what you both have

36:47.000 --> 36:48.627
And for it still
not to be over...

36:48.640 --> 36:49.993
Here we go.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.059
Finley:
Do you mind?
Reporter:
No. Please, go ahead.

36:52.070 --> 36:54.402
I am speaking to alicia dutton,

36:54.410 --> 36:56.731
The woman who has
beth ann gibson.

36:56.740 --> 37:00.642
The cop who helped me save
those kids in that fire.

37:00.650 --> 37:02.003
We know who you are.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.648
We know your name, your face,

37:04.650 --> 37:06.049
Where you grew up.

37:06.050 --> 37:08.644
We know your friends
and your family.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.218
You can't run.

37:10.220 --> 37:11.858
We will find you.

37:11.860 --> 37:15.079
You're burned; you know that.

37:15.100 --> 37:18.820
You call me,
you bring back that girl,

37:18.830 --> 37:20.718
And we can help you.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.232
Woman (over tv): Authorities
are still asking for help

37:24.240 --> 37:26.196
Locating the whereabouts
of this woman,

37:26.210 --> 37:28.269
Maryland state trooper
alicia dutton,

37:28.280 --> 37:31.738
In connection with
the ballard school...

37:47.190 --> 37:50.023
Don't let finley
get in your head.

37:50.030 --> 37:51.918
Okay.

37:51.930 --> 37:53.261
Buyer's almost here.

37:53.270 --> 37:54.760
He's five minutes out.

37:54.770 --> 37:57.591
We make the swap,
they get the girl,

37:57.600 --> 38:00.205
We get the money back
that they took from us,

38:00.210 --> 38:03.202
We're gone.

38:03.210 --> 38:05.599
Tahiti.

38:05.610 --> 38:07.669
Tahiti.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.889
No, no,
a-absolutely not.

38:17.890 --> 38:20.779
Ballard has given
our daughter a wonderful...

38:20.790 --> 38:22.223
Got a text.

38:22.230 --> 38:25.051
A d.C. Street address,
but in a foreign country?

38:25.070 --> 38:26.549
What country?

38:26.570 --> 38:27.594
Tahiti.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.592
The address is here,
but then it says "tahiti."

38:30.600 --> 38:32.067
The address is here.
That's it.

38:32.070 --> 38:33.537
She signed it "tahiti."

38:34.410 --> 38:37.072
When we come back, the first son

38:37.080 --> 38:39.230
Says thank you
to the man who stepped

38:39.250 --> 38:42.276
In front of a bullet
that was meant for him.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.419
Kyle, what do you have
to say to mr. Gibson,

38:44.420 --> 38:45.842
Now that it's over?

38:45.850 --> 38:48.341
It's not over.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.157
Not until beth ann comes home.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.479
Reporter:
Of course.

38:51.490 --> 38:52.809
Mr. Gibson, we've learned

38:52.830 --> 38:54.980
That the president
has refused to pardon

38:55.000 --> 38:57.252
Ex-cia director widener.

38:57.260 --> 38:58.420
What do you think about that?

38:58.430 --> 38:59.522
Francis:
Um...

38:59.530 --> 39:01.088
That's none of my business.

39:01.100 --> 39:03.364
I just want to be here
for beth ann.
(phone ringing)

39:12.950 --> 39:15.544
(distorted voice):
Francis, are you ready?

39:16.820 --> 39:18.447
Yes. I am.

39:18.450 --> 39:21.510
It's time to self-destruct.

39:44.910 --> 39:47.708
Hey, secret service.

39:47.710 --> 39:49.701

39:54.220 --> 39:55.915
Where is she?

39:58.660 --> 39:59.888
Sold her.

39:59.890 --> 40:01.619

40:03.730 --> 40:05.755
To the people
that shot me.

40:10.100 --> 40:12.568
Shot comm's here, too.

40:15.110 --> 40:16.873
Double-cross.

40:16.880 --> 40:18.108
(scoffs)

40:18.110 --> 40:19.998
Believe that?
Dunn:
Who has her?

40:20.010 --> 40:21.739
Is it widener?

40:21.750 --> 40:23.445
I don't know.

40:23.450 --> 40:25.941
No names in this business.

40:25.950 --> 40:27.281
Names get you dead.

40:27.290 --> 40:29.212
What's your name?

40:29.220 --> 40:31.882
Names get you dead.

40:31.890 --> 40:33.084
Help us find beth ann.

40:33.090 --> 40:36.127
Something happens to her,
she ends up dead...

40:36.130 --> 40:37.392
I don't know your name,

40:37.400 --> 40:39.197
ButI know
you're no child killer.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.622
No, you're right,
secret service,

40:40.630 --> 40:42.359
I'm not a
child killer.

40:42.370 --> 40:44.429
But a kid got killed
in that mansion,

40:44.440 --> 40:47.364
And that's what
I'm gonna go down for.

40:47.370 --> 40:49.133
Don't you do it.

40:49.140 --> 40:50.801
You think the
mansion was bad?

40:50.810 --> 40:53.973
Wait till you see what gibson
does to get his daughter back.

40:56.950 --> 40:58.474
Screw it.

41:09.260 --> 41:11.421
Worse than
the kidnapping.

41:11.430 --> 41:14.820
Whatever gibson is gonna do
to get his daughter back

41:14.840 --> 41:17.161
Is gonna be worse
than the kidnapping.

41:26.180 --> 41:27.408
I want to thank you

41:27.410 --> 41:29.275
For helping me make
this happen, lqle.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.271
Of course, mr. Gibson.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.918
Anything for you.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.148
It was a big ask.

41:34.150 --> 41:35.515
So thanks.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.351
He's a parent,
just like you.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.214
He should be here.

41:41.260 --> 41:43.251
Mr. President,
there is

41:43.260 --> 41:44.921
A threat assessment
on that man.

41:44.930 --> 41:48.764
He's a ballard parent
with a kidnapped kid.

41:48.770 --> 41:50.465
Devore:
He's the man who
saved my son's life

41:50.470 --> 41:51.698
On national television.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.928
I'll look like an
ungrateful coward

41:53.940 --> 41:57.307
If I don't go out there
and shake his hand.

41:57.310 --> 41:58.777
Can you keep
me safe?

41:58.780 --> 41:59.929
Yes.

41:59.950 --> 42:01.599
We've been through
this place a dozen times.

42:01.620 --> 42:04.009
We've searched both gibsons
from head to foot.

42:04.020 --> 42:07.080
Principal: The president and
first lady of the United States.

42:10.290 --> 42:14.886
(distorted voice):
You 7/ do something even you
could not have imagined.

42:14.900 --> 42:17.721
