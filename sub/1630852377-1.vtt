WEBVTT

00:01.570 --> 00:02.271
(upbeat rock music)

00:02.437 --> 00:04.208
- [Narrator] They
walk downstairs.

00:05.410 --> 00:06.345
- Slimy?

00:07.447 --> 00:08.317
No, that's not it.

00:08.449 --> 00:10.755
- [Narrator] They
bounce, they stretch,

00:10.755 --> 00:11.790
and they spin.

00:13.426 --> 00:14.997
A flying disc.

00:15.196 --> 00:17.502
A walking metal coil.

00:17.502 --> 00:18.671
- Stealthy?

00:18.704 --> 00:20.140
- No.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.011
- [Narrator] But where
did they come from?

00:22.210 --> 00:23.981
And who created them?

00:24.181 --> 00:26.352
- It's Slinky.

00:28.256 --> 00:29.560
- [Narrator] The untold stories

00:29.626 --> 00:33.634
behind America's most
iconic toy innovations.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.472
- Kids want real toys.

00:36.607 --> 00:38.811
- They must have
thought he was crazy.

00:39.044 --> 00:40.314
Crazy!

00:40.480 --> 00:42.384
- [Narrator] The
visionary ideas.

00:42.484 --> 00:45.659
- Some of the best toys
break some sort of rule.

00:45.725 --> 00:49.165
- It became such a craze
that it caught the attention

00:49.365 --> 00:50.801
of president Johnson.

00:51.770 --> 00:53.373
- [Narrator] The
happy accidents.

00:53.507 --> 00:55.411
- If you uncoil the slinky,

00:55.511 --> 00:58.518
suddenly it can be used
as a radio antenna.

00:58.651 --> 01:00.822
- [Narrator] And the
spectacular fails.

01:00.822 --> 01:02.190
- They're suing us.

01:03.126 --> 01:04.429
- He believed enough in it,

01:04.529 --> 01:06.667
even though he was
severely in debt.

01:08.102 --> 01:08.971
- It's just a true Testament

01:09.104 --> 01:10.107
to the kind of
woman that she was,

01:10.273 --> 01:12.311
fearless, determined.

01:13.547 --> 01:16.353
(man laughing)

01:16.520 --> 01:18.156
- We're gonna have so much fun.

01:39.298 --> 01:41.035
- [Narrator] In
the spring of 1943,

01:41.102 --> 01:43.073
the United States is
fighting a world war

01:43.239 --> 01:44.743
in Europe and the Pacific.

01:46.145 --> 01:47.081
- Most people were confident

01:47.180 --> 01:49.285
that the United States
entry into the war

01:49.418 --> 01:52.526
in 1941, 1942 was
tipping the balance.

01:52.558 --> 01:55.463
But by 1943, the war seems
to be turning in their favor,

01:55.598 --> 01:58.036
but it's very much
up in the air.

01:58.169 --> 02:00.574
It was not a sure
thing by any stretch.

02:01.743 --> 02:03.046
- [Narrator]
Critically important

02:03.179 --> 02:05.317
is maintaining
control of the sea,

02:05.450 --> 02:07.455
where ships very vital resources

02:07.487 --> 02:10.895
to the 16 million men and women
serving in the armed forces.

02:12.164 --> 02:14.769
Back at home, millions,
more work overtime

02:14.769 --> 02:16.372
in support of the war effort.

02:23.620 --> 02:27.127
Like one mechanical engineer
at a shipyard in Philadelphia,

02:27.194 --> 02:29.799
who's doing his part to
try solving a problem

02:29.799 --> 02:31.903
that plagues US warships.

02:32.839 --> 02:35.276
His name is Richard James.

02:36.646 --> 02:39.218
- He is charged with trying
to come up with a way

02:39.318 --> 02:42.424
to keep sensitive
instruments safe on ships

02:42.592 --> 02:43.660
while they're out at sea.

02:43.794 --> 02:45.030
You know, what's
going to keep them

02:45.196 --> 02:47.535
from falling and breaking.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.907
- And he thought that
suspending that equipment

02:49.907 --> 02:51.643
by torsion Springs,

02:51.743 --> 02:53.815
which are Springs with
no tension on them,

02:53.881 --> 02:57.088
he might be able to keep
it functioning properly.

02:57.220 --> 03:00.427
- Richard James was
full of ingenuity.

03:00.493 --> 03:05.504
He was a guy who could not
repress his creative endeavors.

03:06.506 --> 03:09.780
He started as a kid
scavenging parts

03:09.780 --> 03:11.583
and making his own toys.

03:11.683 --> 03:14.656
So he had an entrepreneurial
bent as well.

03:34.796 --> 03:37.400
- He accidentally knocks
over one of the Springs

03:38.537 --> 03:41.710
and it just happened
to kind of bounce

03:41.810 --> 03:43.981
and it appeared almost
like it was walking.

03:50.861 --> 03:52.966
- [Narrator] The runaway
spring will one day become

03:52.966 --> 03:54.669
an iconic American toy

03:56.640 --> 03:59.478
selling more than 300
million worldwide.

04:06.425 --> 04:08.463
But on this day in 1943,

04:08.530 --> 04:11.302
it's up to James to figure
out what to do with it.

04:14.408 --> 04:16.413
- You could practically
see the light bulb

04:16.580 --> 04:18.483
go on over his head.

04:18.617 --> 04:20.420
And he said to his wife, Betty,

04:20.588 --> 04:22.625
I think we've got a toy here.

04:23.727 --> 04:26.566
Betty by now has been
through loads of ideas

04:26.733 --> 04:28.604
that Richard churned out.

04:28.704 --> 04:32.946
Undoubtedly, she thought,
oh no, here we go again.

04:33.012 --> 04:36.152
- Apparently he brought
home a lot of strange ideas

04:36.352 --> 04:37.053
to his wife.

04:39.324 --> 04:40.193
- I'm telling you Betty,

04:40.326 --> 04:42.632
it's like some kind
of magic trick.

04:42.732 --> 04:46.005
It doesn't work every
time, but when it does.

04:51.048 --> 04:52.952
- There's no gain to it.

04:53.019 --> 04:56.359
Why would children want to
play with such a simple thing?

04:56.492 --> 04:59.398
- Because where you
see coiled wire,

04:59.498 --> 05:02.539
they'll see something
that acts like it's alive

05:02.738 --> 05:04.642
and moves by itself.

05:07.347 --> 05:09.553
- He's got that inventor's mind.

05:09.752 --> 05:10.955
He saw something that

05:11.055 --> 05:14.361
he couldn't convince
other people to see yet.

05:14.494 --> 05:17.668
It was a huge uphill
battle for him.

05:17.802 --> 05:19.640
- During world war
II a lot of toys

05:19.806 --> 05:21.744
were made of card or paper

05:21.810 --> 05:25.618
because essential materials
like zinc, steel, rayon,

05:25.784 --> 05:27.521
were needed for the war efforts.

05:28.624 --> 05:30.561
- [Narrator] The Navy
rejects James's idea

05:30.661 --> 05:33.734
to use coiled springs to
stabilize ship equipment.

05:37.374 --> 05:39.979
So he throws himself into
his long shot creation

05:40.781 --> 05:41.850
and for two years,

05:41.917 --> 05:44.789
experiments with different
types of steel wire.

05:46.626 --> 05:50.233
- There are so many
variables to perfect

05:50.366 --> 05:52.772
when you're making
a spring device.

05:52.772 --> 05:54.676
There's tension,

05:54.709 --> 05:58.850
there's the kind of kinetic
energy that you want to release.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.957
Lots of physics,
lots of mechanics.

06:02.090 --> 06:05.765
He tested and tried
and prototyped,

06:05.831 --> 06:10.808
eventually coming up with a
Swedish blue industrial steel

06:12.043 --> 06:17.087
coiled spring with
just exactly 98 coils.

06:18.389 --> 06:19.959
It's stacks two and
a half inches tall.

06:22.698 --> 06:24.702
- I've got it, come see.

06:34.822 --> 06:37.628
(both laughing)

06:44.609 --> 06:46.580
- [Narrator] With
Betty finally on board,

06:46.713 --> 06:48.850
she makes a pivotal
contribution.

06:49.852 --> 06:51.455
- What are we going to call it?

06:57.167 --> 07:01.375
Slimy? No, that's not it.

07:01.609 --> 07:02.210
- Stealthy?

07:06.051 --> 07:08.155
- No, no that's not it.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.071
It's slinky.

07:17.875 --> 07:18.744
- Slinky.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.956
- She found the word slinky
and she thought it was perfect,

07:24.956 --> 07:26.894
and the rest is history.

07:27.027 --> 07:28.630
- [Narrator] Next,
Richard and Betty

07:28.764 --> 07:31.235
take the biggest
gamble of their lives.

07:31.235 --> 07:34.108
- They decided to borrow $500

07:34.174 --> 07:38.482
and make 400 Slinky's by
hiring an outside firm

07:38.650 --> 07:40.688
to make them in a model shop.

07:40.788 --> 07:43.694
- It's only the start
of the challenge though.

07:43.794 --> 07:47.569
And then to really start
selling it to retailers,

07:47.635 --> 07:50.575
because this looks
like no other toy

07:50.774 --> 07:51.976
out there on the market.

08:00.527 --> 08:01.964
- [Narrator] 170 Miles away,

08:02.063 --> 08:04.802
at the General Electric
labs in Connecticut,

08:04.902 --> 08:07.508
a chemical engineer
works on another problem

08:07.675 --> 08:09.277
plaguing the US war effort.

08:13.687 --> 08:15.758
- We don't think of rubber
when we think of waging war,

08:15.924 --> 08:17.260
but it's pretty essential.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.532
It's a component
in so many pieces

08:19.699 --> 08:22.004
of this vast military arsenal.

08:22.004 --> 08:22.839
- If we don't get rubber

08:22.938 --> 08:25.410
we'll have to stop
making good tanks.

08:25.544 --> 08:26.747
- [Narrator 2] We
also need rubber tires

08:26.946 --> 08:28.817
for Jeeps and planes.

08:30.086 --> 08:31.221
- [Narrator] Naturally
occurring rubber

08:31.288 --> 08:35.764
is harvested from trees no
longer accessible to the US.

08:37.067 --> 08:40.273
- Japan had invaded a lot of
the rubber producing countries,

08:40.273 --> 08:42.144
sort of cut off our supply.

08:42.144 --> 08:43.279
- Because of the war effort,

08:43.279 --> 08:44.883
it becomes paramount to create

08:44.982 --> 08:47.253
a synthetic
alternative to rubber.

08:48.590 --> 08:49.793
- [Narrator] Chemical
engineer James Wright

08:49.892 --> 08:52.163
makes it his mission
to come up with one.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.838
- James Wright had
been born in Scotland

08:55.971 --> 08:58.710
and he was working
for General Electric

08:58.844 --> 09:01.148
on various different challenges.

09:04.555 --> 09:07.327
- [Narrator] He mixes different
chemicals with silicone oil

09:09.297 --> 09:12.605
and when he adds boric
acid, it solidifies.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.813
But instead of forming a
hard rubber like substance,

09:21.890 --> 09:24.696
the compound remains
soft, sticky,

09:24.796 --> 09:27.735
unlike anything
Wright has ever seen.

09:32.177 --> 09:36.953
- A ball of this putty bounced
if you threw it on the floor,

09:37.053 --> 09:40.093
would settle into a
puddle if left alone.

09:40.159 --> 09:44.836
- You can stretch it to great
lengths without it snapping.

09:44.902 --> 09:48.811
- James Wright kept showing
this new goo to his coworkers,

09:48.910 --> 09:51.750
but no one could find
an application for it.

09:51.916 --> 09:52.719
- They actually sent it out

09:52.852 --> 09:54.121
to a bunch of
different scientists

09:54.187 --> 09:56.526
so maybe that they could
figure out a way to use it.

09:56.659 --> 09:58.028
After a while he
couldn't figure out

09:58.162 --> 10:00.534
how to really use
what he created

10:00.701 --> 10:02.170
and he gave up on it.

10:06.178 --> 10:08.817
- [Narrator] Wright has no
idea this bizarre substance

10:08.884 --> 10:12.090
will help usher in a
completely new market for toys,

10:13.660 --> 10:16.666
sell over 350 million pieces,

10:17.801 --> 10:20.239
and make nearly half
a billion dollars

10:22.310 --> 10:24.882
for someone else.

10:29.224 --> 10:32.565
- [Newsreel announcer] September
2nd, 1945 and Americas joy

10:32.698 --> 10:35.002
bubbled over into
unrestrained jubilation.

10:36.104 --> 10:37.975
- The period after
the second world war

10:38.075 --> 10:41.750
is a moment of tremendous
economic opportunity.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.087
And as American
soldiers return home,

10:44.187 --> 10:46.358
they're looking for a
return to normality,

10:46.391 --> 10:50.033
to enjoy the prosperity that
comes from the end of the war.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.373
And so what you see
are Americans seeking
that prosperity

10:53.373 --> 10:55.243
in all kinds of areas.

10:56.746 --> 10:58.449
- [Narrator] Including
one former Naval engineer,

10:58.717 --> 11:02.056
who's happy to leave the war
behind to chase his new dream.

11:07.668 --> 11:11.977
Richard James uses the rest of
his savings, and a $500 loan,

11:12.076 --> 11:15.416
to start the James
spring and wire company.

11:15.684 --> 11:20.026
Betting everything on 400
of his one and only product,

11:20.026 --> 11:20.928
The Slinky.

11:29.110 --> 11:32.283
Now, he must convince local
toy stores to sell it.

11:34.722 --> 11:36.960
- I know, you're thinking,

11:37.060 --> 11:39.497
that looks like just
an ordinary spring.

11:40.767 --> 11:43.874
- It is just an ordinary spring.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.911
- Well, that is
where you're wrong.

11:47.982 --> 11:51.355
I just need to get our plank
from my car and I can show you.

11:51.355 --> 11:52.859
Just one moment, okay?

11:53.025 --> 11:57.167
- Look, kids want real toys.

11:57.167 --> 11:58.335
- Okay, here look.

12:03.747 --> 12:05.449
- Not interested.

12:09.792 --> 12:11.963
- I can't even imagine

12:12.030 --> 12:17.040
what any toy store owner
or buyer would have thought

12:18.342 --> 12:22.918
when Richard James walked
in trying to sell a spring.

12:25.056 --> 12:26.927
- [Narrator] By November, 1945,

12:27.060 --> 12:30.100
Richard James is
running out of time.

12:30.199 --> 12:34.407
- The big sales time for
toys is at the holidays,

12:34.474 --> 12:37.915
if you can't sell your toy
during the Christmas season,

12:38.082 --> 12:40.521
you are basically washed up.

12:40.521 --> 12:42.290
This was his make
or break moment.

12:47.233 --> 12:48.435
- [Narrator] He talks Gimbals,

12:48.469 --> 12:51.375
one of the most popular
department stores
in Philadelphia,

12:51.375 --> 12:53.345
into displaying his new toy.

12:57.921 --> 12:59.692
- If Gimbals didn't sell,

12:59.792 --> 13:02.430
if the Slinky's didn't
fly off the shelves,

13:02.430 --> 13:04.367
he was at the end of the line.

13:06.338 --> 13:10.046
- But as Christmas nears,
not a single Slinky is sold.

13:15.256 --> 13:16.859
- You've gotta eat something.

13:26.846 --> 13:28.449
Where are you going?

13:31.121 --> 13:32.123
Where are you going?

13:33.125 --> 13:34.027
- Gimbals.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.358
- Richard James wasn't
just an inventor.

13:49.358 --> 13:50.159
- Come on over, folks,

13:50.292 --> 13:52.598
and see what the
amazing Slinky can do.

13:54.134 --> 13:57.942
- He was a showman and he
was going to show the world

13:58.142 --> 13:59.945
that Slinky was a thing.

14:02.918 --> 14:05.657
- Mam, would you like to see
what the amazing Slinky can do?

14:05.857 --> 14:06.458
Let me show you.

14:08.596 --> 14:11.034
All you do is tip it like this.

14:18.449 --> 14:20.052
- [Narrator] In
less than two hours

14:20.186 --> 14:24.060
James sells all 400 Slinky's,

14:25.463 --> 14:27.200
but he doesn't make a cent.

14:29.905 --> 14:33.045
- He had a problem because
the Slinky's that he created

14:33.178 --> 14:35.082
were only a dollar at retail.

14:35.182 --> 14:37.521
So there wasn't a lot
of margin in there.

14:37.588 --> 14:39.926
- [Narrator] So Richard
James needs a new plan

14:40.059 --> 14:43.065
or his new creation
is worthless.

14:49.210 --> 14:51.649
By 1947, it's been four years

14:51.949 --> 14:54.221
since General Electric
engineer, James Wright,

14:54.354 --> 14:57.227
created his strange
putty substance.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.799
While GE did patent
the invention,

14:59.965 --> 15:01.770
they've done nothing with it.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.272
- At the end of four
years of research,

15:03.338 --> 15:06.011
it came down that there
was no practical use

15:06.211 --> 15:07.413
for this bouncing putty.

15:09.618 --> 15:10.720
- [Narrator] But one evening,

15:10.987 --> 15:14.127
the substance makes the
rounds at a GE cocktail party

15:14.227 --> 15:16.966
and an out of work
copywriter takes an interest.

15:19.204 --> 15:22.343
- Peter Hodgson
was an ad writer,

15:22.511 --> 15:25.049
but he was kind of between jobs,

15:25.115 --> 15:28.455
he was in debt, he was
looking for his next gig.

15:29.525 --> 15:30.827
- So Peter's at this party.

15:30.994 --> 15:32.799
He so intrigued and fascinated

15:32.799 --> 15:35.336
watching everyone
play with this putty.

15:35.369 --> 15:38.643
- Look, he's been playing with
this stuff for 15 minutes.

15:40.647 --> 15:43.352
Somebody's going to get
rich off this stuff,

15:43.520 --> 15:45.122
I say it might as well be us.

15:47.393 --> 15:49.799
- GE agrees to sell the
rights to the putty,

15:49.965 --> 15:54.040
to Hodgson for just $147.

15:54.140 --> 15:57.514
- Ruth Fallgater owned a
shop called The Block Shop

15:57.548 --> 16:00.654
in New Haven, Connecticut
and she did a yearly catalog.

16:00.687 --> 16:04.862
And in 1949, her and Peter
worked together on the copy,

16:05.029 --> 16:07.100
which featured bouncing putty,

16:07.200 --> 16:09.137
but it was marketed
more toward adults.

16:09.270 --> 16:11.509
It was in a clear plastic case

16:11.576 --> 16:15.316
and it was on a page
alongside a spaghetti maker.

16:15.449 --> 16:17.320
- [Narrator] Sales are abysmal.

16:18.422 --> 16:19.759
- Ruth said, you can
take it from here

16:19.759 --> 16:21.495
because it's not
selling well enough.

16:21.596 --> 16:23.834
And that's when Peter
Hodgson said, okay,

16:24.033 --> 16:25.369
I'm on my own with this.

16:26.739 --> 16:28.743
- [Narrator] As one
partnership dissolves,

16:32.584 --> 16:34.254
another one starts.

16:36.592 --> 16:38.830
Across the country,
childhood friends,

16:38.830 --> 16:41.067
Rich Knerr and
Arthur "Spud" Melin

16:41.201 --> 16:42.638
are looking to find their way.

16:43.740 --> 16:45.777
- They had a perfect
Southern California

16:45.777 --> 16:47.915
sort of vibe around them.

16:48.081 --> 16:49.184
The kind of attitude that,

16:49.317 --> 16:50.286
we don't know what
we're going to do

16:50.386 --> 16:53.826
with our college degrees
but whatever we choose,

16:53.826 --> 16:55.797
we're going to
have fun doing it.

17:01.642 --> 17:04.281
- [Narrator] The enterprising
duo dream of a business,

17:04.380 --> 17:07.219
selling and training
falcons for hunting.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.961
- And the way they were going
to train the falcons is,

17:11.061 --> 17:13.567
they were going to shoot
meatballs in the air

17:13.666 --> 17:15.737
and watch the falcons
chase after them.

17:22.183 --> 17:26.091
- But regular slingshots aren't
durable or powerful enough,

17:26.224 --> 17:28.295
so they build their own version.

17:32.470 --> 17:34.141
(man laughing)

17:34.274 --> 17:35.777
- We're gonna have so much fun.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.319
- They were made
from Southern Ash

17:40.386 --> 17:43.292
and they had strips of
rubber from south America

17:43.392 --> 17:46.565
and then they hand tied
leather as the pouch.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.939
- [Narrator] With new
and improved slingshots,

17:50.105 --> 17:51.543
Rich and Spud are ready to get

17:51.642 --> 17:54.347
their Falcon training
business off the ground.

17:58.255 --> 17:58.890
- Morning.

17:58.890 --> 18:01.228
- Hi, what can we do for you?

18:01.294 --> 18:04.568
- I'm shopping for a Falcon,
but what's that thing.

18:04.668 --> 18:06.906
- It's how we teach the
birds to dive for prey,

18:07.106 --> 18:08.510
and meatballs.

18:08.543 --> 18:09.812
- Can I try?

18:11.549 --> 18:12.584
- Sure.

18:13.820 --> 18:17.026
- It turns out their homemade
slingshots were so durable,

18:17.193 --> 18:18.997
so good, and so accurate,

18:19.163 --> 18:20.133
that people were more interested

18:20.232 --> 18:22.738
in the slingshots
themselves, than the birds.

18:34.662 --> 18:36.498
- [Narrator] For
a $7 down payment

18:36.565 --> 18:39.739
they buy a bandsaw and
start making slingshots

18:39.739 --> 18:42.277
in the Knerr family garage.

18:42.309 --> 18:44.782
- So here these guys are,
they're taking these slingshots

18:44.782 --> 18:46.351
and hitting targets with them.

18:46.451 --> 18:48.890
And they sort of took
that like comic book vibe

18:49.190 --> 18:52.030
and they're like, wham,
the targets hit wham.

18:52.597 --> 18:55.469
- Oh!
[laughter]

18:56.572 --> 18:58.108
- [Narrator] They
call their Slingshot,

18:58.308 --> 18:59.712
the Wham-O Sportsman.

19:01.849 --> 19:06.224
And in 1949, the
Wham-O company is born.

19:10.199 --> 19:11.502
One day, they will sell many

19:11.602 --> 19:14.508
of the most recognizable
toys of all time

19:15.844 --> 19:18.950
and their iconic creations
will be worth billions.

19:22.356 --> 19:25.630
But for now they're
not even thinking toys.

19:26.932 --> 19:31.809
- That Slingshot led to things
like blow guns and boomerangs

19:32.744 --> 19:34.948
and fencing swords.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.356
It was a little bit
all over the map

19:38.488 --> 19:42.263
and it was also a
pretty small demographic

19:42.396 --> 19:44.400
that would want their products.

19:48.375 --> 19:51.381
- [Narrator] Despite
taking in $100,000 a year,

19:51.515 --> 19:53.820
Wham-O's founders
reach a crossroads,

19:55.757 --> 19:59.531
continue selling to a
niche market or aim higher.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.170
- They were never
going to break through

20:02.269 --> 20:04.976
without thinking
outside the box.

20:05.242 --> 20:09.284
Something that would reach
the consumers in a fresh way.

20:09.383 --> 20:11.355
- [Narrator] With the
baby boom in full swing,

20:11.421 --> 20:14.595
the United States is primed
for a toy revolution.

20:16.932 --> 20:19.437
If the creative minds
behind the Slingshot,

20:19.538 --> 20:23.178
Slinky, and Bouncing Putty
want to be part of it,

20:23.278 --> 20:25.683
they must risk
everything to capitalize

20:26.919 --> 20:28.288
or lose it all.

20:31.595 --> 20:32.664
(birds chirping)

20:32.831 --> 20:34.401
(suspenseful instrumental music)

20:34.568 --> 20:36.171
- [Narrator] In April, 1950,

20:36.271 --> 20:39.812
entrepreneur Peter
Hodgson is $12,000 in debt

20:39.812 --> 20:41.683
on his Bouncing Putty.

20:41.816 --> 20:44.287
He's been marketing
it to adults,

20:44.420 --> 20:47.293
but now he envisions
a new approach.

20:47.426 --> 20:50.534
(suspenseful instrumental music)

20:50.600 --> 20:53.038
- [David] He realizes
Easter's around the corner,

20:53.038 --> 20:54.775
and he thinks about an egg.

20:56.277 --> 20:58.148
Why don't we take
that substance,

20:58.315 --> 21:00.152
and put it in an egg shape,

21:00.285 --> 21:03.659
and we'll sell it
as a Easter toy.

21:05.429 --> 21:06.933
- [Narrator] And the
former ad executive

21:06.933 --> 21:09.303
introduces another new idea.

21:10.707 --> 21:11.308
- [Christopher] Bouncing Putty

21:11.474 --> 21:12.578
was the original name,

21:12.711 --> 21:15.583
but it really deserved
something better.

21:16.819 --> 21:20.727
And one of Peter Hodgson's
ingenious moments

21:20.727 --> 21:22.463
was to rebrand it.

21:22.597 --> 21:26.505
(dramatic instrumental music)

21:28.609 --> 21:30.514
- [Tim] He discovered
that if you flattened it,

21:30.647 --> 21:32.417
and pressed it on a comic book,

21:32.483 --> 21:34.755
it would pull the picture
right off the page,

21:34.888 --> 21:36.626
and then you could
stretch the face,

21:36.759 --> 21:39.030
and then make all
kinds of funny shapes.

21:41.034 --> 21:42.637
- [Narrator] Then
a few months later,

21:42.771 --> 21:44.074
the New Yorker Magazine

21:44.074 --> 21:46.946
publishes a story
about Silly Putty.

21:47.012 --> 21:49.552
- [Christopher] It was
the kind of earned PR

21:49.718 --> 21:51.488
that every product manager

21:51.622 --> 21:54.494
dreams of in just three days.

21:54.628 --> 21:58.970
Silly Putty sales
went to 250,000 units.

22:00.072 --> 22:01.341
- [Narrator] In
less than a year,

22:01.407 --> 22:05.517
Silly Putty becomes a
blockbuster toy worldwide.

22:05.650 --> 22:06.351
- [Christopher] Silly Putty

22:06.518 --> 22:08.590
proves to be Peter Hodgson's

22:08.789 --> 22:10.193
ticket to the good life.

22:10.359 --> 22:12.564
He lives a life of luxury.

22:12.631 --> 22:17.641
He has hundreds of millions
of dollars in assets.

22:18.743 --> 22:20.847
- [Narrator] Peter
Hodgson dies in 1976,

22:20.947 --> 22:25.289
leaving an estate
valued at $140 million.

22:25.389 --> 22:28.395
The next year his company
is sold to Crayola,

22:28.495 --> 22:30.499
and sales of Silly
Putty ultimately reach

22:30.667 --> 22:33.272
more than 300 million units.

22:33.405 --> 22:35.342
(upbeat instrumental music)

22:35.442 --> 22:36.311
- [Christopher] Kids
may have been using

22:36.411 --> 22:38.950
Silly Putty in all
sorts of fun ways,

22:39.083 --> 22:41.589
but adults saw some
practical uses.

22:41.689 --> 22:45.028
It was great for getting
pet hair off of things

22:45.028 --> 22:47.166
or lint off your clothing

22:47.166 --> 22:50.305
or grime off your painted walls.

22:50.405 --> 22:53.278
The Apollo 8
astronauts also used it

22:53.411 --> 22:55.950
as a way of adhering their tools

22:56.084 --> 22:58.455
from floating around
the space capsule

22:58.589 --> 23:01.161
when they were in zero gravity.

23:01.161 --> 23:03.666
This is one of
those evergreen toys

23:03.833 --> 23:06.171
that just keeps on selling.

23:06.171 --> 23:07.908
(upbeat instrumental music)

23:08.008 --> 23:10.680
- [Narrator] Meanwhile,
by the mid 1950s,

23:10.747 --> 23:14.454
Slinky has also finally
become a big moneymaker

23:14.588 --> 23:17.026
thanks to Richard
James's ingenuity.

23:17.126 --> 23:18.696
- [Tim] Well, after
the success at Gimbels,

23:18.763 --> 23:21.602
he had to figure out a
way to make these himself.

23:21.702 --> 23:24.374
He couldn't farm it
out to a machine shop.

23:24.473 --> 23:26.177
There wasn't a lot
of margin in there.

23:26.177 --> 23:27.748
So what did he do
as an engineer?

23:27.847 --> 23:30.419
He ended up designing
the machines

23:30.586 --> 23:32.591
that would take 80 feet of wire,

23:32.724 --> 23:35.797
and coil at 98 times
to make Slinkys.

23:36.732 --> 23:38.202
- [Narrator] Demand is so big,

23:38.202 --> 23:40.673
he builds six
machines to keep up.

23:42.142 --> 23:43.780
- [Christopher] Slinky
is often running,

23:43.879 --> 23:46.284
or maybe I should
say often walking,

23:46.451 --> 23:48.756
and it's a good business.

23:48.889 --> 23:52.697
(upbeat instrumental music)

23:54.634 --> 23:58.308
The James family
buys 31 acre estate

23:58.475 --> 24:00.212
in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania,

24:00.212 --> 24:02.116
one of the priciest
neighborhoods

24:02.116 --> 24:03.519
in Philadelphia.

24:03.619 --> 24:06.525
They've got six
kids, life is good.

24:06.625 --> 24:09.197
- [Narrator] Outwardly,
everything looks perfect,

24:09.197 --> 24:11.367
but all isn't as it appears.

24:11.502 --> 24:14.441
(suspenseful instrumental music)

24:14.641 --> 24:15.242
(seagulls chirping)

24:15.475 --> 24:16.477
In 1957,

24:16.578 --> 24:19.383
looking for their own
million dollar idea,

24:19.518 --> 24:21.522
Wham-O Co-founders Rich Knerr,

24:21.622 --> 24:24.094
and Spud Melin are
strolling on the beach

24:24.094 --> 24:26.164
when it finds them.

24:26.197 --> 24:27.033
- Ow.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.301
- Oh-oh-oh.

24:28.502 --> 24:29.505
What's that?

24:29.638 --> 24:30.807
(upbeat instrumental music)

24:30.940 --> 24:33.045
- Like a miniature
flying saucer.

24:33.045 --> 24:35.382
Man, can it go. (laughs)

24:35.516 --> 24:38.523
(upbeat instrumental music)

24:38.622 --> 24:40.158
- [Narrator] They
return the strange disc

24:40.158 --> 24:41.060
to its owner,

24:41.194 --> 24:44.233
former air force
pilot, Fred Morrison.

24:44.534 --> 24:46.772
- [Tim] Fred Morrison
was a World War II pilot.

24:46.939 --> 24:48.208
One day he was on the beach

24:48.208 --> 24:50.112
throwing a metal pie tin,

24:50.112 --> 24:52.316
when a beachcomber came up,

24:52.316 --> 24:55.255
and wanted to buy
the tin from him.

24:56.725 --> 25:00.332
Now it was a 5
cent cake pan tin,

25:00.332 --> 25:02.270
and he could sell
it for 25 cents.

25:02.270 --> 25:03.372
And that's when he decided

25:03.539 --> 25:05.209
I need to go into business.

25:05.209 --> 25:06.077
- [Narrator] Morrison,

25:06.210 --> 25:08.650
substitutes the cake
pan tin for plastic,

25:08.816 --> 25:10.620
and calls it the Whirlo Way

25:10.787 --> 25:12.489
after a famous racehorse.

25:12.590 --> 25:15.797
Then later changes it
to The Flyin-Saucer.

25:15.963 --> 25:17.801
- [Tim] This was around 1947

25:17.967 --> 25:19.538
when Roswell was happening,

25:19.704 --> 25:21.408
and everything was outer space.

25:21.575 --> 25:22.944
So he thought the flying saucer

25:23.078 --> 25:25.883
would be a good
thing to call it.

25:25.983 --> 25:29.324
- [Narrator] After updating
the design in 1954,

25:29.324 --> 25:31.729
Morrison changes the name again

25:31.895 --> 25:34.200
to the Pluto Platter.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.870
- Names of very important,

25:35.937 --> 25:38.943
and you can build a
brand around a name.

25:39.076 --> 25:42.016
Who's going to buy
a Pluto Platter?

25:42.116 --> 25:44.521
- [Narrator] Sales
never do take off,

25:44.688 --> 25:46.124
but enter Rich and Spud

25:46.257 --> 25:48.428
who think they can
make it a success.

25:48.629 --> 25:49.564
(air swooshing)

25:49.731 --> 25:51.501
Wham-O buys the manufacturing,

25:51.602 --> 25:53.338
and production
rights from Morrison.

25:54.608 --> 25:56.011
They make design modifications

25:56.144 --> 25:58.917
to increase the
accuracy and distance,

25:59.016 --> 26:02.223
and look to its origins
to find a new name.

26:02.223 --> 26:04.160
(upbeat instrumental music)

26:04.160 --> 26:05.395
- [Tim] So early on,

26:05.395 --> 26:08.368
people would throw
metal pie tins

26:08.368 --> 26:10.072
from the Frisbies Pie Company,

26:10.172 --> 26:12.845
and they would say
like in golf, "Four."

26:13.011 --> 26:15.016
They would yell "Frisbee!"

26:15.148 --> 26:17.053
So they decided to
trademark the name,

26:17.152 --> 26:19.758
and that's how the
Frisbee was born.

26:19.891 --> 26:21.494
(upbeat instrumental music)

26:21.628 --> 26:23.032
- [Narrator] In the
first two years,

26:23.164 --> 26:26.438
Wham-O sells more
than a million disks.

26:26.438 --> 26:27.708
- They decided they're
gonna go to all

26:27.907 --> 26:28.843
the college campuses,

26:28.943 --> 26:31.348
and these college kids
start figuring out

26:31.348 --> 26:35.322
how to play like
Frisbee football

26:35.322 --> 26:37.527
or even Frisbee golf.

26:37.627 --> 26:38.963
- [Announcer] Hundreds
of Frisbee players

26:39.063 --> 26:41.234
have come to display
their skills.

26:41.334 --> 26:44.340
- [David] And all of
these things eventually

26:44.340 --> 26:47.379
solidified Frisbee's position

26:47.379 --> 26:49.784
as the premier throwing disk.

26:50.820 --> 26:51.388
- [Narrator] With the Frisbee's

26:51.388 --> 26:53.392
popularity spreading,

26:53.392 --> 26:55.731
Knerr and Melin
are now officially

26:55.930 --> 26:56.999
in the toy business,

26:58.802 --> 27:01.609
but nothing could prepare
them for the world,

27:01.708 --> 27:04.815
for the toy Wham-O
would unleash next.

27:04.948 --> 27:08.856
(suspenseful instrumental music)

27:11.360 --> 27:13.098
- It doesn't bite.

27:13.198 --> 27:14.668
It does do something
amazing thing folks.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.506
- [Narrator] By the late 1950s,

27:16.672 --> 27:18.375
Slinky's creator Richard James,

27:18.375 --> 27:19.277
and his wife, Betty

27:19.376 --> 27:22.751
appear to be living
the American Dream.

27:22.851 --> 27:25.523
But as sales of the
Slinky begin to decline,

27:25.656 --> 27:27.994
Richard suffers
a midlife crisis.

27:29.063 --> 27:31.267
- Richard isn't getting
as much publicity

27:31.267 --> 27:31.935
as he craves.

27:32.102 --> 27:33.839
He starts getting distracted.

27:34.006 --> 27:35.744
He starts having affairs.

27:35.877 --> 27:37.246
- [Narrator] Richard also joins

27:37.246 --> 27:38.883
a religious organization,

27:38.983 --> 27:41.822
and start sending them
large amounts of money.

27:42.022 --> 27:43.124
- He goes all in.

27:43.258 --> 27:45.262
He's donating money
left and right.

27:45.262 --> 27:46.198
He donate so much money

27:46.264 --> 27:49.972
that he put the Slinky
Company in huge debt.

27:50.105 --> 27:50.773
- Things are starting to get

27:50.940 --> 27:52.710
really tough financially.

27:52.810 --> 27:55.415
They owe banks and steel
suppliers more money

27:55.415 --> 27:56.919
than what they're taking in.

27:58.254 --> 27:59.356
- [Narrator] Within
a few months,

27:59.423 --> 28:03.464
Richard James downward
spiral takes another turn.

28:03.464 --> 28:06.237
(suspenseful instrumental music)

28:06.237 --> 28:09.043
(suitcase thuds)

28:11.113 --> 28:11.782
- Honey?

28:11.982 --> 28:13.786
(Richard sighs)

28:13.886 --> 28:16.926
- The Lord has called me
to help spread his word

28:17.059 --> 28:18.829
to the people of South America.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.169
I'll be leaving
for Bolivia today.

28:24.273 --> 28:25.876
- What are you talking about?

28:28.448 --> 28:30.185
- This is my calling.

28:31.922 --> 28:34.226
The Lord has-
- What about the children?

28:35.863 --> 28:36.965
- You'll figure it out.

28:40.038 --> 28:41.207
As for the company,

28:42.744 --> 28:44.615
let the creditors have it,

28:44.781 --> 28:46.985
unless you wanna
run it yourself.

28:48.789 --> 28:51.494
- Maybe I'll do exactly that.

28:51.494 --> 28:55.536
(suspenseful instrumental music)

28:56.905 --> 28:59.143
(footsteps thudding)

28:59.310 --> 29:00.012
- [Azhelle] At a
time where women

29:00.178 --> 29:01.815
were definitely not expected

29:01.915 --> 29:03.920
to take on that kind
of responsibility

29:04.053 --> 29:05.824
or even be capable of taking

29:05.957 --> 29:07.794
on that kind of responsibility,

29:07.961 --> 29:08.796
it's just a true testament

29:08.929 --> 29:10.332
to the kind of
woman that she was,

29:10.332 --> 29:12.537
fearless, determined.

29:12.537 --> 29:16.344
(suspenseful instrumental music)

29:16.477 --> 29:17.714
- [Narrator] Betty
takes out a mortgage

29:17.947 --> 29:18.816
on her home,

29:18.949 --> 29:21.655
determined to revive
the Slinky brand.

29:21.822 --> 29:23.593
She gambles everything she has

29:23.792 --> 29:25.095
on a Hail Mary.

29:25.261 --> 29:26.899
(soft instrumental music)

29:27.099 --> 29:27.800
- [Jordan] Betty James

29:27.967 --> 29:29.638
had very, very little resources.

29:29.804 --> 29:30.539
So what does she do?

29:30.539 --> 29:32.644
She goes out and hires musicians

29:32.810 --> 29:33.846
to write a jingle.

29:33.946 --> 29:36.885
She knew that if she can
have a catchy jingle,

29:37.052 --> 29:38.689
people would remember it,

29:38.789 --> 29:41.061
and they would remember
the product brand.

29:41.227 --> 29:44.333
- Jingles in the
1960s were huge.

29:44.333 --> 29:45.870
Absolutely huge.

29:46.003 --> 29:46.972
You would hear
them on the radio,

29:47.105 --> 29:48.710
see them on the television.

29:48.842 --> 29:50.445
Well, these were
powerful marketing tools.

29:50.546 --> 29:52.751
♪ Who walks the stairs
without a care ♪

29:52.884 --> 29:54.420
♪ It shoots so high in the sky ♪

29:54.521 --> 29:56.826
♪ Bounce up and down
just like a clown ♪

29:56.992 --> 29:59.196
♪ Everyone knows its Slinky ♪

29:59.296 --> 30:00.967
- [Narrator] But will
a jingle be enough

30:01.133 --> 30:02.269
to save the company?

30:02.402 --> 30:04.574
And Betty James is
sinking fortunes.

30:05.843 --> 30:08.549
(upbeat instrumental music)

30:08.549 --> 30:10.687
Meanwhile, after
making a fortune

30:10.853 --> 30:12.924
on the Slingshot
and the Frisbee,

30:13.024 --> 30:15.897
Wham-O founders Rich
Knerr and Spud Melin

30:15.996 --> 30:18.468
are looking for
their next big idea.

30:19.904 --> 30:21.575
- [Laurie] I think
that Melin and Knerr

30:21.575 --> 30:22.577
didn't think they were you know,

30:22.877 --> 30:25.215
the only ones that can
invent something fabulous.

30:25.315 --> 30:28.254
And they had this
amazing open door policy.

30:28.421 --> 30:30.560
It didn't matter who you were.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.430
If you had an idea,

30:32.430 --> 30:34.434
they were going to listen.

30:34.434 --> 30:35.870
(footsteps thudding)

30:36.003 --> 30:37.239
- So this is a buddy of yours?

30:37.239 --> 30:38.208
- It's his wife.

30:38.307 --> 30:39.844
So she has something
to use for exercise

30:40.045 --> 30:40.947
in Australia.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.619
He thinks we'll get
a kick out of it.

30:43.619 --> 30:45.021
- One of Melin's neighbors,

30:45.155 --> 30:47.594
Joan Anderson returned
from Australia

30:47.594 --> 30:49.998
with a bamboo exercise hoop.

30:50.165 --> 30:53.939
(upbeat instrumental music)

30:57.079 --> 30:59.618
(Rich and Spud applauds)

30:59.918 --> 31:02.022
- [Jazmine] One of Jones'
friends mentioned that

31:02.189 --> 31:03.291
the movements that she made

31:03.458 --> 31:05.730
kind of reminder
of Hula dancers,

31:05.730 --> 31:09.069
and boom, the name
Hula Hoop was born.

31:09.169 --> 31:10.640
- [Azhelle] When they saw it,

31:10.640 --> 31:11.942
and how it was being used,

31:12.042 --> 31:13.913
kind of a light bulb
moment went off.

31:14.046 --> 31:15.448
They thought we can
manufacture this,

31:15.583 --> 31:17.520
and we can make
this into a fun toy.

31:19.056 --> 31:22.262
(Hula Hoop spinning)

31:22.362 --> 31:24.601
- [Jordan] They set up
this handshake deal.

31:24.601 --> 31:25.636
It was totally verbal,

31:25.636 --> 31:26.705
no paper at all.

31:26.905 --> 31:27.640
And they said,

31:27.640 --> 31:30.012
"If the Hula Hoop becomes a hit,

31:30.178 --> 31:31.815
we'll give you royalties."

31:31.948 --> 31:33.351
And that's how it all started.

31:34.253 --> 31:37.693
(soft instrumental music)

31:37.693 --> 31:40.399
(suspenseful instrumental music)

31:40.498 --> 31:42.035
- [Narrator] Before
it hits shelves,

31:42.202 --> 31:44.040
Wham-O upgrades the hoop,

31:44.206 --> 31:45.944
(upbeat instrumental music)

31:46.076 --> 31:48.147
with a new durable
lightweight plastic,

31:48.314 --> 31:49.283
and eye-catching colors

31:49.383 --> 31:52.557
to replace the bland
wood tone of the bamboo.

31:54.092 --> 31:55.429
- [Azhelle] They put
beads inside of it

31:55.529 --> 31:57.332
so that when kids
would move their hips,

31:57.499 --> 31:59.805
you'd get a fun sound effect.

31:59.971 --> 32:01.808
(upbeat instrumental music)

32:01.942 --> 32:03.277
- [Tim] They went
to local parks,

32:03.411 --> 32:05.415
and had different
people demo it,

32:05.516 --> 32:07.386
and get kids in
Southern California

32:07.486 --> 32:09.958
to talk about it and
wanna play with it.

32:10.024 --> 32:12.062
- [Jazmine] People were
drawn to the Hula Hoop.

32:12.128 --> 32:15.002
It was so simple but
required concentration.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.540
It had a rhythm to
it kind of hypnotic.

32:17.540 --> 32:20.211
(upbeat instrumental music)

32:20.278 --> 32:21.448
- [Announcer] It's the
new Shoop Shoop Hula Hoop,

32:21.548 --> 32:23.986
with the new shoop
sounds in the hoop.

32:24.119 --> 32:25.255
Hey, take it out,
show it everywhere.

32:25.421 --> 32:27.693
It's more fun from Wham-O.

32:27.693 --> 32:28.896
- [Tim] They were
making it as fast

32:29.096 --> 32:30.098
as they could,

32:30.231 --> 32:32.202
but also farming
out to production

32:32.402 --> 32:33.271
to many different places

32:33.404 --> 32:35.141
just to simply to
keep up with demand.

32:35.275 --> 32:37.345
- [Narrator] By
the summer of 1958,

32:37.445 --> 32:40.485
the Hula Hoop becomes
the biggest toy fad

32:40.485 --> 32:42.289
the world has ever seen.

32:43.157 --> 32:46.064
(dramatic instrumental music)

32:46.130 --> 32:49.737
But not everyone is
celebrating Wham-O smash hit.

32:51.140 --> 32:52.610
- They're suing us.

32:52.677 --> 32:55.281
- Oh, that sure doesn't
read like a love letter.

32:56.283 --> 33:00.358
(suspenseful instrumental music)

33:05.168 --> 33:08.207
(upbeat rock music)

33:10.746 --> 33:12.216
- [Narrator] In 1963,

33:12.315 --> 33:15.021
after years of debt
and declining sales,

33:15.154 --> 33:17.159
Betty James hopes
to bring Slinky

33:17.325 --> 33:19.196
back from the brink of ruin.

33:19.396 --> 33:20.867
Betting everything

33:20.867 --> 33:22.970
on an expensive
marketing campaign

33:23.104 --> 33:24.841
with a new catchy jingle.

33:25.041 --> 33:25.710
♪ It's Slinky ♪

33:25.710 --> 33:26.812
♪ It's Slinky ♪

33:35.461 --> 33:37.199
♪ Slinky Slinky it's

33:37.365 --> 33:38.803
- Yeah, I'm a nerd.

33:38.803 --> 33:40.806
So I remember that
stuff. (laughs)

33:40.806 --> 33:41.675
Yeah, I know.

33:41.675 --> 33:42.610
- It was cool.

33:42.710 --> 33:44.614
- [Carl] Every time
they hear the jingle,

33:44.614 --> 33:46.117
they think of the toy.

33:46.317 --> 33:47.988
So it was genius.

33:48.187 --> 33:49.023
And so that's why

33:49.222 --> 33:50.426
it became popular.

33:50.526 --> 33:53.197
- [Richard] And
Betty had the vision,

33:53.364 --> 33:55.569
and realized that television,

33:55.669 --> 33:58.141
and jingles and this
kind of marketing

33:58.307 --> 34:00.713
was extremely important

34:00.813 --> 34:04.588
in embedding the product
into American society.

34:04.621 --> 34:05.255
So she bet,

34:05.421 --> 34:07.459
She made a bet and she won.

34:08.629 --> 34:09.531
- [Narrator] Ironically,

34:09.631 --> 34:11.935
the toy that started
as a failed design

34:12.102 --> 34:14.273
for the military in World War II

34:14.373 --> 34:17.614
would later be used
during the Vietnam War.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.884
- [David] If you uncoil
the Slinky and throw it,

34:20.084 --> 34:21.020
say up in a tree

34:21.120 --> 34:24.493
or put one hand on a
pole and stretch it out,

34:24.594 --> 34:26.899
suddenly it can be
used as a radio antenna

34:26.899 --> 34:28.769
because it's the perfect length

34:28.835 --> 34:33.277
for the seven to eight
megahertz frequency range

34:33.411 --> 34:35.215
for communications in the field.

34:35.381 --> 34:36.818
(upbeat instrumental music)

34:36.818 --> 34:38.121
- [Narrator] Betty
goes on to run

34:38.254 --> 34:40.593
James Industries
for nearly 40 years

34:40.593 --> 34:42.664
as President and CEO.

34:42.664 --> 34:43.933
And just a few years

34:43.933 --> 34:47.272
before she sells
the company in 1998,

34:47.339 --> 34:50.813
the movie "Toy Story"
brings back the Slinky dog.

34:51.848 --> 34:54.521
More than 300 million Slinkys

34:54.587 --> 34:58.094
in all varieties will
sell in James's lifetime.

34:58.260 --> 34:59.463
Enough to circle the earth

34:59.597 --> 35:02.202
about 150 times, if stretched.

35:03.437 --> 35:04.908
- Betty moved product,

35:04.908 --> 35:06.912
she got orders in hand,

35:06.912 --> 35:08.448
and she made the most of it.

35:08.548 --> 35:12.590
She proved to be every
bit as good a salesperson

35:12.690 --> 35:16.130
as Richard was without
the liabilities.

35:16.296 --> 35:20.072
(suspenseful instrumental music)

35:20.171 --> 35:21.976
- [Narrator] Meanwhile,
Wham-O is facing

35:22.175 --> 35:23.478
their own liability.

35:23.645 --> 35:24.881
- [Rich] They're suing us.

35:26.183 --> 35:27.687
- [Jazmine] Hulu
was a huge success.

35:27.787 --> 35:30.058
But the two that had
brought the idea to 'em,

35:30.224 --> 35:31.862
Joan and Wayne Anderson,

35:31.862 --> 35:34.300
hadn't seen any royalties.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.101
- [Narrator] And the lawsuit

35:35.268 --> 35:36.871
isn't their only problem.

35:38.307 --> 35:39.410
- What does that look like?

35:39.577 --> 35:40.145
- It looks like a Hulu Hoop.

35:40.311 --> 35:41.581
- [Rich] It sure does.

35:42.550 --> 35:43.484
But it's not.

35:44.353 --> 35:46.256
It's a Hoop Around,

35:46.390 --> 35:48.160
they're cheaper
than a Hula Hoop,

35:49.229 --> 35:52.002
(suspenseful instrumental music)

35:52.168 --> 35:53.371
and they're everywhere.

35:54.339 --> 35:56.979
(suspenseful instrumental music)

35:57.178 --> 35:58.381
(glasses thuds)

35:58.548 --> 36:00.185
- They couldn't stop people

36:00.251 --> 36:03.124
from creating plastic
hoops just like theirs.

36:03.224 --> 36:05.328
So you've got all
kinds of counterfeits

36:05.495 --> 36:06.799
coming out onto the markets

36:06.898 --> 36:09.904
like the Hooper Dupers
and the Wiggler Hoops.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.010
- [Narrator] They
manufactured tens of millions

36:13.210 --> 36:14.614
more Hula Hoops,

36:14.747 --> 36:17.653
but demand
dramatically drops off.

36:19.189 --> 36:21.360
And by the end of 1958,

36:21.460 --> 36:24.300
the company reports a
loss of about 90,000

36:24.499 --> 36:25.468
in today's dollars.

36:26.738 --> 36:29.944
The Hula Hoop bubble
has officially burst.

36:29.944 --> 36:31.214
(dramatic instrumental music)

36:31.380 --> 36:32.616
- They couldn't give them away.

36:32.616 --> 36:33.351
And of course,

36:33.518 --> 36:35.121
they stopped the production.

36:35.354 --> 36:35.923
In fact,

36:35.923 --> 36:37.225
we have an expression,

36:37.358 --> 36:39.330
"It went the way
of the Hula Hoop."

36:39.496 --> 36:41.634
Meaning that it went away.

36:42.536 --> 36:43.437
- [Narrator] Knerr and Melin

36:43.505 --> 36:46.277
must now make good on
that handshake deal

36:46.376 --> 36:49.317
with a warehouse full
of unsold Hula Hoops,

36:49.517 --> 36:50.418
and a growing debt.

36:50.519 --> 36:52.155
- [Christopher] When
the Anderson's case

36:52.288 --> 36:54.326
finally got settled in court,

36:54.527 --> 36:57.065
Wham-O had so few assets

36:57.232 --> 36:58.702
that they only had to pay

36:58.802 --> 37:03.845
the Anderson's a mere
$6,000 for their concept,

37:05.314 --> 37:06.985
which had turned into
this incredible toy craze.

37:08.287 --> 37:09.657
- [Narrator] To
save their company,

37:09.757 --> 37:12.429
Knerr and Melin must
do what they do best,

37:12.563 --> 37:15.969
find another hit
before it's too late.

37:15.969 --> 37:19.577
(soft instrumental music)

37:22.449 --> 37:23.753
- [Narrator] After the
meteoric rise,

37:23.852 --> 37:26.625
and spectacular
fall of the Hula hoop,

37:26.758 --> 37:28.829
founders Rich Knerr
and Arthur Melin

37:28.929 --> 37:32.335
are desperate to get
Wham-O back on track.

37:32.469 --> 37:33.706
- [Christopher] Wham-O basically

37:33.839 --> 37:36.678
has a business
model that they burn

37:36.845 --> 37:39.851
white hot with a
toy for a while,

37:39.851 --> 37:42.355
and then demand drops off.

37:43.290 --> 37:44.527
Now they're on the lookout

37:44.694 --> 37:46.430
for the next big thing.

37:47.332 --> 37:50.873
(upbeat instrumental music)

37:52.776 --> 37:55.214
- And a pollster
named Robert Carrier

37:55.348 --> 37:57.018
came home one day to see his son

37:57.018 --> 38:00.993
sliding on their
concrete driveway,

38:00.993 --> 38:02.396
he had the hose running,

38:02.563 --> 38:04.232
and it was slick concrete.

38:04.332 --> 38:05.569
- [Christopher]
Robert had the idea

38:05.736 --> 38:07.740
to take vinyl coated plastic

38:07.740 --> 38:09.009
called Naugahyde,

38:09.009 --> 38:10.979
stitched it at intervals,

38:10.979 --> 38:12.717
inserted a hose,

38:12.783 --> 38:16.525
and the water squirted
out at those intervals.

38:16.624 --> 38:18.161
- [Narrator] After
trading out Naugahyde

38:18.161 --> 38:20.599
for a less expensive
vinyl plastic,

38:20.666 --> 38:25.175
Wham-O introduces America
to the Slip 'N Slide.

38:25.175 --> 38:28.882
It immediately sells
3,000 units at $9.95

38:28.882 --> 38:30.418
in a matter of months.

38:30.619 --> 38:31.755
It's a simple toy,

38:31.888 --> 38:34.594
but it was a huge
hit for these guys.

38:34.727 --> 38:36.230
- [Narrator] Then
another inventor

38:36.363 --> 38:39.270
approaches them with
a new opportunity.

38:39.369 --> 38:41.909
- [Christopher] Norman
Stingley was an engineer

38:42.041 --> 38:45.282
working in the
petrochemical industry.

38:45.381 --> 38:48.020
- [Tim] He devised a way
to take this specialized

38:48.020 --> 38:50.491
rubber called polybutadiene,

38:50.592 --> 38:52.664
and molded in such a
way that it would create

38:52.796 --> 38:56.404
a very, very dense
high bouncing ball.

38:56.504 --> 38:58.274
Basically you can
throw it under a table

38:58.508 --> 38:59.309
on an angle,

38:59.510 --> 39:00.712
it will hit the floor,

39:00.712 --> 39:01.247
hit the table,

39:01.413 --> 39:02.182
and then reverse it,

39:02.348 --> 39:04.219
spin and come back to you.

39:04.386 --> 39:06.090
And it was this table trick

39:06.390 --> 39:09.764
that made Spud and Rich
have that wow moment,

39:09.897 --> 39:12.069
because a lot of
high bounce balls

39:12.069 --> 39:12.703
were on the market,

39:12.870 --> 39:16.043
but not ones that could do that.

39:16.043 --> 39:19.784
(upbeat instrumental music)

39:21.554 --> 39:24.059
- [Narrator] Wham-O
introduces the Super Ball.

39:24.059 --> 39:24.928
And once again,

39:24.928 --> 39:25.829
has a smash hit

39:25.963 --> 39:28.434
in the hands of
kids across America.

39:29.604 --> 39:33.545
- They sold 6 million
of 'em in 1965 alone.

39:33.678 --> 39:34.747
- [Announcer] Discover
your youth power

39:34.747 --> 39:35.616
with Super Ball.

39:35.716 --> 39:38.020
Under a dollar
wherever toys are sold.

39:38.020 --> 39:41.160
- I got my Super Ball!

39:41.160 --> 39:43.130
- [Announcer] By Wham-O.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.134
- [David] It became such a craze

39:45.134 --> 39:46.505
that it caught the attention

39:46.704 --> 39:48.407
of President Johnson.

39:48.541 --> 39:50.445
President Johnson
orders five dozen

39:50.646 --> 39:51.614
of these balls,

39:51.714 --> 39:54.687
and gives them away
as presidential gifts.

39:54.854 --> 39:57.158
(upbeat instrumental music)

39:57.158 --> 39:59.496
(dramatic instrumental music)

39:59.597 --> 40:01.768
- [Narrator] It's rumor
that the Super Ball

40:01.901 --> 40:03.973
may have also inspired the name

40:03.973 --> 40:04.875
of the most watched

40:04.974 --> 40:07.011
professional sporting
event in America.

40:08.180 --> 40:09.784
In 1966,

40:09.884 --> 40:12.824
Pro Footballs AFL
and NFL conferences

40:12.923 --> 40:15.830
prepare to battle it
out in a final big game

40:15.929 --> 40:18.434
to be called the World
Championship Game.

40:20.605 --> 40:21.406
- [Jazmine] Lamar Hunt,

40:21.574 --> 40:23.277
the founder of the AFL,

40:23.277 --> 40:25.649
and the owner of the
Kansas City Chief

40:25.749 --> 40:29.189
saw his kids playing
with the Super Ball.

40:29.189 --> 40:30.124
(dramatic instrumental music)

40:30.224 --> 40:33.231
- [Christopher] And in
a play on that name,

40:33.231 --> 40:35.569
he gave that big game

40:35.702 --> 40:38.173
a new title that
has stuck with it

40:38.173 --> 40:40.613
for more than half a century.

40:40.812 --> 40:41.815
(fans cheering)

40:41.914 --> 40:43.117
- [Announcer] The
Chief's on to the banger.

40:43.150 --> 40:44.587
35 to 10.

40:44.720 --> 40:47.727
A super debut for
the Super Bowl.

40:47.893 --> 40:49.764
(upbeat instrumental music)

40:49.897 --> 40:51.768
- [Narrator] America's
most iconic toys

40:51.901 --> 40:55.374
have captured the
imagination for decades.

40:55.575 --> 40:58.181
(tools clanking)

40:58.181 --> 40:59.349
But it's their creators,

40:59.517 --> 41:01.053
and the challenges they faced

41:01.053 --> 41:03.391
that are truly inspiring.

41:03.490 --> 41:07.065
- Betty James is
definitely a hero of mine.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.802
She was not only a genius,

41:08.935 --> 41:11.642
but she also forged
a way for women

41:11.808 --> 41:13.477
in the toy business.

41:14.947 --> 41:17.653
- [Christopher] Peter
Hodgson was a man

41:17.820 --> 41:19.557
who fulfilled his dream,

41:19.724 --> 41:21.961
fame fortune, the good life,

41:22.061 --> 41:25.702
all thanks to that
little egg full of goo.

41:26.871 --> 41:29.844
- [Tim] Richard Knerr
and Arthur Spud Melin

41:30.010 --> 41:32.348
were really fun-loving guys,

41:32.348 --> 41:34.185
and it was always
the wow factor.

41:34.185 --> 41:35.488
They wanted to find a toy

41:35.589 --> 41:37.392
that made you sort
of step back and go,

41:37.559 --> 41:39.864
"Whoa, that was interesting."

41:41.199 --> 41:42.637
(Slinky thuds)

41:42.736 --> 41:45.408
- [Azhelle] Novelty
toys built America

41:45.509 --> 41:47.813
in the sense that they
have allowed people

41:47.913 --> 41:50.452
at every price point
to get in on the fun.

41:50.552 --> 41:52.890
- [Christopher] Toys
like Slinky, Silly Putty,

41:53.023 --> 41:56.998
the Hula Hoop build
us as a culture,

41:56.998 --> 41:57.933
as country,

41:58.033 --> 42:01.374
and as a toy industry
they united people.

42:01.541 --> 42:03.244
- [Tim] All of these toys,

42:03.244 --> 42:04.079
what they have in common

42:04.079 --> 42:06.016
is they're hands-on toys.

42:06.116 --> 42:08.120
There's a connection
between your hands,

42:08.220 --> 42:11.795
and your brain in the
development of kids.

42:11.894 --> 42:14.533
So these toys certainly
built the kids

42:14.633 --> 42:16.838
that would grow up
and build America.

42:16.971 --> 42:20.612
(upbeat instrumental music)
