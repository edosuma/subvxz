01:28.630 --> 01:29.415
There were 23 people in my family.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.167
Which ones did you kill?

01:31.216 --> 01:32.501
Tell me!

01:44.605 --> 01:45.765
And you?

03:20.075 --> 03:21.736
You should leave.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.779
I feel like I should learn

03:28.750 --> 03:30.286
to forget things.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.295
But each time I see you

03:38.802 --> 03:41.043
I remember everything.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.511
I don't want that anymore.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.060
You want to forget me?

04:01.158 --> 04:02.648
And I will!

04:46.870 --> 04:48.610
We'll see how long you can last!

04:49.164 --> 04:50.199
Talk!

04:50.540 --> 04:51.746
What is your name?

04:54.503 --> 04:56.744
Department Six is incompetent.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.586
You've been here so long,

04:58.632 --> 05:00.497
and your mouth is still sealed.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.800
If I get you back to Dali Temple Prison,

05:04.513 --> 05:07.755
I promise you'll tell me everything.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.850
When I do, you'll think this place is heaven.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.441
Yaohua,

05:23.573 --> 05:28.237
I knew you didn't dare leave me here.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.005
Face-shifting has a huge price.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.265
It doesn't just cut your life short

05:52.936 --> 05:54.767
it makes you age faster!

05:57.107 --> 05:59.223
I don't want to live long.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.146
I want to enjoy the time I do have.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.780
The Sheriff King's murderer escaped.

06:11.830 --> 06:15.072
If the Sheriff King's murderer escaped
from lronblood Prison,

06:15.417 --> 06:17.248
that's a huge embarrassment for Department Six!

06:17.919 --> 06:20.376
They should be used to it, after Emotionless

06:20.422 --> 06:22.253
escaped from their prison.

06:22.591 --> 06:23.956
Can you shut your mouth?

06:24.092 --> 06:25.673
The emperor ordered Department Six

06:25.719 --> 06:27.425
to solve the case within a month,

06:28.263 --> 06:31.050
or the c0nstabu|ary's leaders
would be punished.

06:32.851 --> 06:33.966
What?

06:34.269 --> 06:35.429
I'm going back to Department Six.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.635
Department Six is a disaster zone right now.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.429
Going back there is killing yourself.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.639
What if they can't solve the case?
They'll punish you too.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.688
We can investigate too.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.811
Precisely because they're a mess right now.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.188
And,

06:49.868 --> 06:51.153
for the Sheriff King.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.919
{Department Six}

07:06.843 --> 07:08.674
He doesn't have official papers or a badge.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.335
He just told me to come in and ask.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.878
He said you'd approve it.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.513
What are you doing here?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.720
We've been waiting for you in the courtyard.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.850
I was researching the case,

07:17.896 --> 07:19.227
no time for formalities.

07:19.731 --> 07:20.561
Right,

07:20.607 --> 07:22.643
I looked up some information
about face—shifting,

07:23.318 --> 07:24.808
like the killer knew.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.939
Only one kind allows you
to turn into someone else

07:26.988 --> 07:28.398
in an instant.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.779
It comes from Penglai.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.982
Did you hear about it in Penglai?

07:34.162 --> 07:37.905
The most skilled Peng|ai's face-shifting
is a psychological effect.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.950
It's just an illusion,
not actual face—shifting.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.079
Illusion?

07:44.005 --> 07:47.964
The face-shifter takes a potion
to boost their chi dissemination.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.588
It makes others see things,

07:51.304 --> 07:53.340
but it poisons the face-shifter

07:53.390 --> 07:54.880
and drastically shortens their life.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.889
They only survive by regular doses
of an antidote.

07:57.185 --> 07:57.970
What antidote?

08:00.021 --> 08:01.477
Every sect has their own secret recipe.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.320
Just like your invisibility?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.328
I don't take potions or medicine.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.163
I have my spidersilk cloak and my own chi.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.880
{Face-shifting Craft}

08:29.050 --> 08:31.666
You knew she was from Penglai, didn't you?

08:36.558 --> 08:39.390
Do you think I'm incompetent,

08:39.727 --> 08:41.342
or do you think I was involved?

08:48.069 --> 08:49.354
I'm kidding.

08:49.404 --> 08:52.692
I know you don't care enough to suspect me.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.158
Your Majesty, tours are no small matter!

08:58.204 --> 08:59.364
Please use caution!

08:59.414 --> 09:01.700
I wanted to go out in secret as a civilian,
you wouldn't let me.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.581
Now you advise me to use caution.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.164
I need to see how my people are doing.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.703
What are you afraid of?

09:08.757 --> 09:10.213
But too many people are out

09:10.258 --> 09:11.714
on the Double Ninth!

09:11.760 --> 09:13.250
Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

09:13.303 --> 09:15.259
Should I go where there are no people?

09:15.430 --> 09:16.044
Fool!

09:16.097 --> 09:18.133
Your Majesty, entering the city
without protection

09:18.183 --> 09:19.389
is too dangerous!

09:19.434 --> 09:22.221
Your...Your Majesty! Please reconsider!

09:23.730 --> 09:25.266
I understand your intentions.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.060
But is there no risk hiding in the palace?

09:28.943 --> 09:31.104
How long must I wait here?

09:32.739 --> 09:34.229
I hear the people are unhappy.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.193
I want to see just how unhappy.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.859
I want to see, with my own eyes,

09:39.412 --> 09:41.949
if what they say is the truth,

09:42.791 --> 09:44.747
that I'm seen as a fool of a king?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.120
Out Of my way!

09:52.634 --> 09:55.876
Your Majesty!

10:04.020 --> 10:05.635
What are you doing?

10:06.272 --> 10:07.603
Out Of my way!

10:11.945 --> 10:13.936
Is something the matter with your ears?

10:21.454 --> 10:22.614
Your Majesty!

10:27.669 --> 10:31.662
His Majesty wants to see his people!

10:31.840 --> 10:33.671
Why are you stopping him?

10:34.008 --> 10:35.043
VVhy?

10:36.427 --> 10:39.089
This defiance is intolerable!

10:39.931 --> 10:42.047
Is this how you guard your emperor?

10:43.351 --> 10:44.807
Is it?

10:48.690 --> 10:51.853
Your Majesty, my respects.

10:54.529 --> 10:57.646
May I ask where you plan to go?

10:58.032 --> 11:03.197
Would you like me
to dispatch guards to escort you?

11:07.292 --> 11:08.998
Your concern is noted.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.909
No thank you.

11:13.464 --> 11:17.207
Then allow me to go with you.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.470
Quickly! Inform the prince!

11:26.728 --> 11:28.309
Notify Department Six! Hurry!

11:28.354 --> 11:29.309
Your Majesty!

11:29.355 --> 11:31.562
Department Six!

11:39.532 --> 11:41.614
Reporting! The emperor will enter the city!

11:41.659 --> 11:43.399
Eunch Wu requests an armed escort!

11:43.786 --> 11:44.275
Let's go!

11:44.412 --> 11:45.743
Did Chief Ji give you the order?

11:46.789 --> 11:47.744
Aren't there rules around here?

11:52.253 --> 11:53.163
Eagle Squad, move out.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.160
Tiger Squad goes too.

12:15.026 --> 12:15.435
Look...

12:17.695 --> 12:18.684
Dingdong!

12:18.905 --> 12:21.317
Bell! I haven't seen you in forever!

12:21.366 --> 12:22.196
Without you around

12:22.242 --> 12:24.358
Divine Constabulary is really quiet.

12:25.495 --> 12:26.735
Listen,

12:26.871 --> 12:27.656
Emotion less said

12:27.705 --> 12:29.616
she wants to take us on a trip to
the northwest frontier.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.031
The frontier?!

12:32.627 --> 12:34.242
You'd all freeze to death.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.377
Here, if you're cold, drink something hot.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.252
I'm going to go find some food.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.247
Candy! Candy!

12:39.509 --> 12:40.589
-How muCh'?NAME?

12:40.635 --> 12:41.750
Here.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.011
Emotionless...

12:59.404 --> 13:01.269
Make way! Make way!

13:01.614 --> 13:02.945
Department Six is working on the scene.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.151
Make way! Make way!

13:04.701 --> 13:05.486
Make way! Make way!

13:06.995 --> 13:09.532
Why are all these Department Six people here?

13:13.167 --> 13:15.203
Emotionless, is something going on?

13:15.336 --> 13:16.576
It looks like it.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.036
It's Coldbloodl

13:34.522 --> 13:37.389
Emotionless, should we go check it out?

13:41.696 --> 13:43.027
I don'twant to.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.817
Then let's go back.

13:45.867 --> 13:46.231
OK.

13:48.870 --> 13:49.859
Let's go.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.535
Coldblood, look.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.129
Get back!

14:46.761 --> 14:47.921
Your Majesty,

14:48.554 --> 14:49.760
it's the prince.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.885
Move!

14:53.351 --> 14:54.682
It's the emperor's boat!

14:56.687 --> 14:58.598
-Get the Eagle Squadron‘s boat here!
-Yes!

14:58.648 --> 15:00.934
The rest of you, watch the shore!

15:00.983 --> 15:02.018
Yes!

15:03.444 --> 15:04.183
The prince is here!

15:04.237 --> 15:05.647
Greetings, Your Majesty.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.897
I heard you wished to see the city.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.781
I came to provide protection.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.529
You have my gratitude.

15:12.787 --> 15:13.617
Come with me.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.115
Thank you.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.871
—It looks like the emperor!
—It is the emperor!

15:23.673 --> 15:24.207
Stop! Stop! Stop!

15:27.635 --> 15:32.004
Kneell Kneel down!

15:34.600 --> 15:37.137
Long live the emperor!

15:37.186 --> 15:40.474
Long live, long live the emperor!

15:41.023 --> 15:43.184
His Majesty orders

15:43.234 --> 15:45.270
that you may rise

15:45.319 --> 15:47.685
and resume festivities.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.446
Thank you, Your Majesty.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.994
Such support from your subjects
is pleasing to see.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.125
Their support depends entirely

16:03.671 --> 16:05.707
on my ministers.

16:35.745 --> 16:36.359
Be careful!

17:06.526 --> 17:08.767
Rescue their life, over there. Hurry

17:08.819 --> 17:12.107
Quickly, rescue them, save their life

17:16.953 --> 17:17.942
Move!

17:21.415 --> 17:22.871
Something happened!

17:29.924 --> 17:31.380
Teaching you to run fast is no good!

17:31.425 --> 17:32.210
You don't have the chi control.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.836
The Emperor was assassined

17:33.886 --> 17:34.591
at the temple fair!

17:37.056 --> 17:38.592
The water is too fast here!
Go to downstream and look for him!

17:38.641 --> 17:39.926
There's no question,

17:40.476 --> 17:42.432
it was the imperial bodyguard Liu Yong.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.510
I don't know what to say.

17:45.106 --> 17:46.141
No.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.224
We found Liu Yong's body in the harbor.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.776
He couldn't have been on the Emperor's boat.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.113
It was a Penglai assassin.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.115
He didn't want to escape.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.777
His target was the Emperor.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.117
Who knew before us that
the Emperor was leaving?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.531
Me.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.125
It must have been me.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.627
What? Do you suspect me?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.882
I'm to blame for not protecting him.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.383
The fault is mine alone.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.046
You were also a target.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.964
You needn't blame yourself, my prince.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.724
His Majetsy is blessed.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.009
Heaven preserves worthy rulers.

18:26.981 --> 18:30.269
Mr. Zhuge thinks His Majesty
was blessed today?!

18:31.819 --> 18:33.525
Do you think otherwise?

18:34.488 --> 18:35.978
No I don't.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.656
And fortune will smile upon His Majesty.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.234
What we do next is critical.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.496
I think the prince should return
to Department Six with us

18:45.583 --> 18:46.993
for questioning.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.999
Dali Temple will want to know we did.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.539
I agree.

18:51.589 --> 18:52.169
Wait.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.758
Does this performance amuse you?

18:58.012 --> 18:59.673
Is it fun?

19:02.016 --> 19:04.507
Every one of us knows Ji Yaohua
as sent to Department Six

19:04.560 --> 19:07.347
because she saved the prince's life.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.811
He recommended her.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.681
Now she leads Department Six

19:11.776 --> 19:13.357
because of his order.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.476
And now Department Six

19:15.529 --> 19:17.565
will investigate this case?

19:18.574 --> 19:20.530
Will that convince anyone?

19:21.285 --> 19:25.244
Does anyone still trust Department Six?

19:25.623 --> 19:28.740
Then what do you suggest?

19:28.918 --> 19:31.250
Department Six is responsible
for all crimes in the city.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.250
That's the law.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.374
Who could reproach us

19:35.049 --> 19:36.334
for obeying the law?

19:37.927 --> 19:39.463
Also, with the prime minster

19:39.512 --> 19:41.377
and Dali Temple supervising us,

19:42.056 --> 19:45.048
if anything untoward happens at Department Six,

19:45.601 --> 19:47.057
it's hardly our fault!

19:47.436 --> 19:49.552
A bold accusation!

19:49.730 --> 19:51.061
Thank you for the compliment.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.060
My name is Leng Lingqi.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.279
So you're Coldblood.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.692
Mr. Jiang,

20:06.455 --> 20:08.446
escort the prince to Department Six.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.078
Prince, if you would.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.009
Good. We'll keep looking for the Emperor.

20:24.432 --> 20:27.924
Look! Keep looking!

20:29.353 --> 20:31.935
The Emperor is blessed!

20:34.233 --> 20:35.439
I'm sure you'll find him!

20:40.364 --> 20:42.605
Your Majesty, we're at the palace.

20:43.492 --> 20:48.862
The Emperor is here! Open the gate!

20:52.501 --> 20:56.494
The Emperor is here! Open the gate!

21:00.384 --> 21:00.964
Your Majesty!

21:02.762 --> 21:05.344
Insolent fools! You dare affront the Emperor?!

21:05.389 --> 21:06.595
You'll die forthis!

21:06.640 --> 21:08.551
Don't stand there! Fool! Move!

21:09.894 --> 21:12.226
They impersonated the Emperor! After them!

21:12.271 --> 21:14.353
Don't let them get away! Go!

21:15.649 --> 21:17.435
Go home! Martial law is in force!

21:17.485 --> 21:18.600
Move! Move!

21:18.652 --> 21:20.608
Martial Law

21:20.654 --> 21:27.241
{BY ORDER OF DEPARTMENT SIX CHIEF
JI YAOHUA CITY UNDER MARTIAL LAW}

21:28.245 --> 21:30.486
{THE CITY GATES SEALED CURFEW IN EFFECT
NO TRANSIT WITHIN 10 LI OF CITY}

21:32.917 --> 21:34.282
The rest of you come with me.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.746
Who are you? Halt!

21:39.799 --> 21:41.380
Stop!

21:41.425 --> 21:44.713
Your Majesty, Department Six constables
are everywhere.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.382
First my uncle's men betray me,

21:47.431 --> 21:50.138
and now even the palace gate guards
want to kill me!

21:50.976 --> 21:53.058
Who can I trust?

21:53.854 --> 21:55.219
Don't be afraid.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.355
The court is full of people loyal to you.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.265
Who doesn't want safety for the country?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.651
Who doesn't want peace?

22:02.696 --> 22:05.608
This is all just a plot by a few greedy men.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.023
With only a word from you,

22:07.076 --> 22:09.442
the people's hearts will be yours again.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.235
If you can't trust anyone else,

22:11.288 --> 22:15.031
you should at least trust Lord Zhuge Zhengwo.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.704
Right. My mentor.

22:18.045 --> 22:18.909
Let's go to the Divine Constabulary
to find him.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.374
—More soldiers!
—They keep coming!

22:25.511 --> 22:26.717
How can I get to find him?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.839
Your Majesty, I have an idea.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.757
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.011
Come to the Emperor's rescue!

22:37.064 --> 22:38.099
Who are you? Stop!

23:00.129 --> 23:00.743
Coldblood...

23:00.796 --> 23:01.581
Coldblood,

23:01.630 --> 23:02.710
did something happen at the temple fair?

23:02.756 --> 23:04.417
Do you need our help?

23:04.925 --> 23:05.380
Where is Yayu?

23:05.426 --> 23:06.711
-She's as|eep.NAME?

23:07.052 --> 23:07.837
Who is it?

23:08.178 --> 23:09.167
It's Coldblood.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.336
Aunt Poise,

23:11.724 --> 23:12.588
I'm looking for Yayu.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.260
Yayu is sleeping.

23:14.310 --> 23:14.969
What do you need?

23:15.519 --> 23:16.725
Excuse me.

23:17.438 --> 23:18.097
Coldbloodl

23:28.949 --> 23:29.563
Yayu...

23:31.452 --> 23:32.817
Come back to Divine Constabulary.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.110
Something has happened in the city

23:35.623 --> 23:37.784
Someone tried to kill the Emperor.
We can't find him.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.496
Zhuge Zhengwo needs your help.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.130
You're very strange.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.253
First you leave alone,

23:54.224 --> 23:55.680
then you come back for me.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.760
The one who tried to kill him

24:00.481 --> 24:01.641
is the woman who killed the Sheriff King.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.014
Don't you want to know who's behind this?

24:09.239 --> 24:10.820
I'll say it one more time.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.067
Your business has nothing to do with me.

24:21.752 --> 24:24.710
I'm a traitor's daughter.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.171
I can't help loyal subjects like you

24:30.094 --> 24:32.005
protect the Emperor.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.514
Don't forget,

24:38.018 --> 24:40.475
the Emperor had my father killed.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.136
Protecting him

24:45.192 --> 24:46.682
is your business.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.693
But the Sheriff King is my business.
You won't help me?

24:55.703 --> 24:58.319
You should understand
why I went back to Department Six.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.714
I don't understand you at all.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.377
If you want someone to understand,

25:19.810 --> 25:21.391
ask Ji Yaohua.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.890
Now leave.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.083
Then should I help explain?

25:51.800 --> 25:52.960
Let's go.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.432
Emotionless, let's go back upstairs.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.259
If the Emperor isn't dead,

26:05.230 --> 26:07.016
and hasn't gone back to the palace,

26:13.489 --> 26:15.400
he'll be at the Divine Constabulary.

26:18.494 --> 26:19.779
Let's go there.

26:19.828 --> 26:23.662
Pack it up! Martial law!

26:25.709 --> 26:27.199
Divine Constabulary is up ahead.

26:27.461 --> 26:28.701
Hurry!

26:31.757 --> 26:32.712
This is Divine Constabulary.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.214
There's a curfew in effect.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.503
I have to get home.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.667
Wait.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.339
This is a gift for you.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.265
No!

26:43.310 --> 26:43.799
It was nothing!

26:44.269 --> 26:45.475
You're going to report a case?

26:45.729 --> 26:47.014
You...you go ahead.

26:47.064 --> 26:47.894
I have to go...

26:47.940 --> 26:49.055
go now.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.789
Is this Divine Constabulary?

27:15.676 --> 27:17.416
The constables are out on a case.

27:18.679 --> 27:19.259
Sir,

27:19.888 --> 27:21.128
who are you looking for?

27:21.849 --> 27:22.634
Zhuge Zhengwo.

27:23.433 --> 27:24.593
Who are you?

27:24.643 --> 27:26.679
Why are you looking for our chief?

27:27.104 --> 27:28.435
I am the reigning Emperor.

27:31.567 --> 27:32.977
Don't kneel!

27:36.238 --> 27:37.774
Just tell him I'm here.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.429
The Master is back.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.561
He wants to see you.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.063
If you want to leave,

28:17.821 --> 28:19.231
it's too late now.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.150
Why are you staring?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.943
Bow to your master!

28:26.705 --> 28:28.070
Master!

28:34.630 --> 28:35.164
Don't be afraid.

28:36.256 --> 28:39.589
Be careful with the fire.
And don't forget to water me.

28:42.262 --> 28:46.926
Everything that was yours is still there.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.842
The city is under curfew.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.478
As soon as we get news that
the Emperor is dead,

28:53.523 --> 28:56.060
the prime minister will find
competing successors.

28:56.109 --> 28:58.942
Then he'll ask you to step in
and keep the peace.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.937
As soon as they see you're still alive,

29:02.074 --> 29:05.487
they'll do whatever you ask.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.363
That little fox.

29:12.167 --> 29:15.159
All he ever cares about is his own survival.

29:25.889 --> 29:26.924
Get up.

29:26.974 --> 29:27.884
He's gone.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.514
Kneeling is uncomfortable.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.343
Don't forget you belong to the An family!

29:32.771 --> 29:34.352
Dismissed!

29:34.398 --> 29:35.808
Yes.

29:44.408 --> 29:46.069
I want to hear you speak.

29:55.544 --> 29:59.082
Fine. I'll talk for you.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.874
You don't have to listen to the old man.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.210
Do I have a choice?

30:08.181 --> 30:09.842
Unless...

30:10.475 --> 30:12.511
You give me the antidote.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.640
Everyone is afraid to die.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.722
But if you think about it,

30:19.067 --> 30:20.853
who doesn't die?

30:25.699 --> 30:27.860
Tell me what I should do next?

30:30.704 --> 30:35.073
A living person shouldn't ask a tree
for advice.

30:43.300 --> 30:47.714
If you're afraid, find someone you can lean on.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.848
I'm leaning on you right now.

30:55.145 --> 30:57.306
Find a living person.

30:57.689 --> 31:01.773
All I am now is a stool.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.155
I still care about you.

31:12.537 --> 31:13.993
Do you love me?

31:26.927 --> 31:28.463
Do you love me?

32:39.332 --> 32:41.744
You're trying to become our queen, aren't you?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.658
Master An's poisoned wine.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.752
What about his poisoned wine?

32:47.048 --> 32:48.128
Did you drink it?

32:56.558 --> 32:58.264
I asked if you drank it?

33:01.062 --> 33:02.518
ldid.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.517
You weren't afraid?

33:13.116 --> 33:14.856
You're afraid?

33:18.580 --> 33:19.911
lam.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.791
If you're nice to me,

33:25.212 --> 33:27.373
I'll make sure you have nothing to fear.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.845
Here

33:38.725 --> 33:41.057
you won't find the antidote.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.646
Where is he?

33:57.285 --> 33:58.240
Here!

33:58.578 --> 33:59.442
Impossible!

34:00.914 --> 34:01.994
Come out!

34:02.666 --> 34:03.155
Your Majesty!

34:03.750 --> 34:05.115
-Get up.NAME?

34:05.961 --> 34:07.497
-Come here.
—Your Majesty,

34:08.255 --> 34:09.415
Sit.

34:11.341 --> 34:12.626
Eat.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.387
What do you want with me?

34:24.521 --> 34:25.886
I haven't decided.

34:30.110 --> 34:31.771
Who are you people

34:32.445 --> 34:34.231
that you dare to treat me like this?

34:35.864 --> 34:38.106
You look like a reasonable woman.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.319
Why are you so brutal with me?

34:40.411 --> 34:41.902
If I was reasonable

34:42.621 --> 34:44.237
I would have killed you!

34:48.503 --> 34:50.368
I am Sheng Dingtian's daughter.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.587
Do you remember him?

34:58.597 --> 35:00.303
Or have you murdered so many

35:00.432 --> 35:01.888
you can't remember them?

35:02.642 --> 35:04.758
You're Sheng Dingtian's daughter?

35:09.482 --> 35:10.392
She has a reason

35:10.692 --> 35:11.932
for keeping you here.

35:12.402 --> 35:14.313
Since you have me,

35:15.655 --> 35:16.986
just kill me!

35:17.240 --> 35:18.821
There's no rush.

35:20.994 --> 35:22.154
I will kill you.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.997
Why is he in imperial robes?

35:28.043 --> 35:29.078
Look!

35:39.095 --> 35:40.426
He's not the Emperor.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.009
He's the Emperor's eunuch.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.011
He put on the imperial robes

35:46.519 --> 35:48.009
to cover the Emperor's escape.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.893
The Emperor is still alive.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.059
Why doesn't he want to be found?

35:56.154 --> 35:57.360
To protect himself.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.612
If you were the Emperor,

36:05.038 --> 36:06.403
who would you trust?

36:06.456 --> 36:07.992
Of course Zhuge Zhengwo.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.706
But he didn't come!

36:11.086 --> 36:12.326
Maybe he can't come.

36:15.298 --> 36:16.538
It's been two days.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.716
Where could he go?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.505
Lord An is providing grain!

36:25.684 --> 36:27.390
Lord An is a good man.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.175
An Yunshan pretends
to be a philanthropist again.

36:35.652 --> 36:37.893
Chief Ji, a letter from Lord An.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.204
Open the door!

36:58.883 --> 37:00.999
You go inside and talk. I'm staying out here.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.752
Come in with us. We're not strangers.

37:08.268 --> 37:11.431
Prince, if the Emperor truly has been harmed,

37:11.771 --> 37:14.387
you must take control of the situation.

37:17.944 --> 37:20.481
I'm not fit to be a leader.

37:21.531 --> 37:24.147
I'm happy to help His Majesty,

37:25.118 --> 37:27.029
but there are some things

37:27.704 --> 37:29.444
beyond my ability.

37:30.623 --> 37:31.783
Prince,

37:32.292 --> 37:34.499
this is no time for humbleness.

37:37.130 --> 37:38.495
The most important thing now

37:39.007 --> 37:41.919
is not to let it be known that
the Emperor is dead,

37:42.969 --> 37:45.301
especially the imperial family's in-laws.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.137
Prime Minister Cai wants them

37:48.224 --> 37:49.805
to fight for the throne

37:49.976 --> 37:51.466
and kill each other,

37:51.686 --> 37:52.596
and then he'll strike.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.394
You have that

37:55.440 --> 37:57.647
strange scent from the An house on you.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.810
Since when do you care what I smell like?

38:02.655 --> 38:05.567
Maybe because I've been
researching corpse orchids?

38:05.617 --> 38:06.823
No.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.651
It's a very distinctive herb.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.829
They have many strange herbs.
They're hard to tell apart.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.329
VVhy?

38:14.709 --> 38:16.449
Do you have a new clue?

38:16.836 --> 38:18.201
Not yet.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.171
Have you ever thought,

38:22.217 --> 38:23.423
if the Emperor really is dead,

38:23.468 --> 38:24.674
and the prime minister takes power,

38:24.719 --> 38:25.925
what would happen to you?

38:31.518 --> 38:32.849
There's no way to know.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.182
If he takes power,

38:37.148 --> 38:38.684
I'll be one of the first to die.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.338
I dragged you into this.

39:07.929 --> 39:11.217
You silly girl. Do you think that scares me?

39:12.684 --> 39:14.265
I've always told you

39:14.602 --> 39:16.433
to think of me as your own mother.

39:17.814 --> 39:19.805
Avenging your parents‘ death

39:20.108 --> 39:21.564
is my business too.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.446
But you don't want me to kill him,

39:29.617 --> 39:30.447
do you?

39:35.039 --> 39:38.497
And if your uncle was in my position,

39:38.918 --> 39:40.579
he wouldn't have wanted you to do it either.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.257
You're such a saint,

39:50.763 --> 39:53.254
always worried about what he would think!

39:55.226 --> 40:00.596
But he might not think about
what I'm thinking about.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.016
Aren't men always like that?

40:05.737 --> 40:07.273
They're usually like that.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.981
They're bad.

40:11.534 --> 40:13.616
Men are all bad!

40:20.168 --> 40:21.578
But Lengqi,

40:21.628 --> 40:22.913
he probably wants

40:22.962 --> 40:24.702
you to let the Emperor go, too,

40:25.381 --> 40:26.621
you think?

40:39.729 --> 40:42.061
Irons Hands has been here waiting for you.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.138
He says things don't look too good right now.

40:44.192 --> 40:45.853
He's concerned about your safety.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.209
Coldbloodl

41:07.006 --> 41:08.371
Not in your uniform tonight?

41:08.424 --> 41:09.163
You look good in that.

41:09.217 --> 41:10.127
Here, eat with us.

41:10.385 --> 41:11.295
No thanks.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.300
I have to go check out
the An house tonight. Who's coming?

41:14.222 --> 41:15.632
Ji Yaohua won't let you go.

41:15.682 --> 41:16.842
Never mind her.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.464
This is rash.

41:18.518 --> 41:19.883
How is this rash?

41:20.520 --> 41:21.976
We should have gone ages ago.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.020
The Emperor was attacked.

41:24.399 --> 41:25.639
The Sheriff King is dead.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.853
Are you really going to tell me
the Ans are innocent?

41:31.364 --> 41:32.604
Are you afraid of the prime minster?

41:33.241 --> 41:34.196
You can't go.

41:34.534 --> 41:35.899
Why can't I go?

41:35.994 --> 41:36.608
My interest is piqued.

41:38.871 --> 41:39.326
Wait!

43:09.962 --> 43:11.247
Probably Prime Minister Cai's men.

43:11.798 --> 43:12.253
What do they want?

43:13.216 --> 43:15.047
To search the place I guess.

43:23.101 --> 43:24.386
Careful!

43:50.753 --> 43:51.788
Protect Aunt Poise!

43:52.505 --> 43:53.164
Let's go!

44:10.940 --> 44:11.929
Save me!

44:33.546 --> 44:35.127
Idiot! They're here to kill you!

44:47.810 --> 44:49.596
I failed to protect you.

44:49.896 --> 44:51.557
I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.

44:53.983 --> 44:55.393
Rise.

44:55.443 --> 44:56.102
Thank you.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.280
And you indulge her,

45:03.784 --> 45:05.399
in this insanity?

45:07.079 --> 45:08.535
Did I do something wrong?

45:09.373 --> 45:11.113
If Yayu hadn't stepped in to save him

45:11.167 --> 45:13.158
would he be sitting here right now?

45:13.920 --> 45:15.581
My position is simple:

45:16.547 --> 45:18.037
whatever Yayu wants,

45:18.090 --> 45:19.170
I support her.

45:21.761 --> 45:23.376
Can you stand here and say

45:23.638 --> 45:24.798
you people have done everything right?

45:25.765 --> 45:26.629
Who do you mean?

45:26.766 --> 45:27.881
You and your Emperor!

45:29.477 --> 45:30.592
I caught the man,

45:32.480 --> 45:33.720
so punish me!

45:35.524 --> 45:37.264
We'll discuss that later.

45:38.319 --> 45:39.434
Lord Zhuge,

45:39.570 --> 45:41.481
Eunch Wu kept me safe until she caught me.

45:41.530 --> 45:43.771
-Did you find any trace of him?NAME?

45:44.784 --> 45:46.445
Near the Hongqiao Market

45:47.078 --> 45:48.909
we found a body

45:50.957 --> 45:52.242
in imperial robes.

45:52.500 --> 45:53.660
It was full of stab wounds.

46:05.054 --> 46:07.340
I can only blame my cowardice

46:08.474 --> 46:10.260
and my indecision.

46:11.477 --> 46:12.683
In the end,

46:14.105 --> 46:16.471
I let the others take the upper hand
of striking first.

46:20.403 --> 46:23.270
You feared using troops would harm the people.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.939
Your intention was good.

46:33.499 --> 46:34.534
Lord Zhuge,

46:35.001 --> 46:36.912
how are things at court right now?

46:37.920 --> 46:41.162
The commoners are wavering,

46:41.424 --> 46:43.085
and the ministers are Ieaderless.

46:43.342 --> 46:44.457
The prime minister

46:44.510 --> 46:46.922
is still hesitating about releasing news
of your death.

46:47.555 --> 46:50.092
He commands all the palace guards.

46:51.058 --> 46:54.016
He ordered all the generals
not to dispatch troops,

46:54.270 --> 46:56.556
The nearest regular army are at Victory Pass.

46:56.731 --> 46:57.811
I want to bring them here.

46:58.190 --> 46:59.680
Do you have the imperial badge?

47:00.318 --> 47:01.854
I don't have it with me.

47:01.902 --> 47:03.233
If we want soldiers,

47:03.279 --> 47:04.143
I'll have to go myself.

47:04.572 --> 47:06.688
Have Department Six send an escort!

47:06.907 --> 47:07.441
No.

47:07.783 --> 47:10.490
Department Six and the Prime Minister Cai

47:10.870 --> 47:12.155
have been odd lately.

47:13.706 --> 47:15.071
They're connected.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.033
I suspect Ji Yaohua has a keeper.

47:21.339 --> 47:22.454
Then I'll take you.

47:22.673 --> 47:23.753
No.

47:24.467 --> 47:26.708
The capital's people are restless now.

47:26.886 --> 47:29.628
I need you to keep my ministers in line.

47:30.556 --> 47:31.545
I can only trust you.

47:34.310 --> 47:35.766
Lingqi, Lueshang,

47:36.062 --> 47:37.848
you two escort His Majesty.

47:39.023 --> 47:40.058
Me?!

47:40.441 --> 47:41.180
You.

47:41.233 --> 47:42.689
This is very important.

47:42.902 --> 47:43.891
Good luck.

47:46.238 --> 47:47.444
Give me an hour

47:47.490 --> 47:48.821
to get things ready.

47:49.075 --> 47:50.565
I'll get us some help.

48:02.922 --> 48:04.583
You had me for so long.

48:05.257 --> 48:06.872
Why didn't you kill me?

48:13.474 --> 48:15.305
If you had asked me to let you go,

48:17.353 --> 48:18.889
I would have killed you.

48:19.188 --> 48:20.724
But you didn't.

48:25.945 --> 48:28.687
You seem so sure what you did was right.

48:37.957 --> 48:44.169
I don't know if that's worth taking revenge on.

48:53.139 --> 48:54.299
How about you?

48:55.975 --> 48:57.840
Have you decided to let me go?

49:00.479 --> 49:01.935
I haven't decided.

49:07.611 --> 49:09.147
Then be careful.

49:11.365 --> 49:13.526
I could change my mind anytime.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.115
Life Snatcher asked us to come.

49:19.165 --> 49:20.120
What happened?

49:20.166 --> 49:20.951
I don't know.

49:21.000 --> 49:21.785
DO you?

49:55.075 --> 49:56.440
Be extra careful.

49:57.578 --> 49:58.943
It's dangerous here.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.116
You'll be safe at Divine Constabulary, Go back.

50:07.505 --> 50:09.370
You suspect Ji Yaohua too?

50:15.262 --> 50:17.002
I suspect a lot of people.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.395
You're as confused as I am,

50:28.734 --> 50:30.065
aren't you?

50:31.028 --> 50:32.017
I'm not confused now.

50:35.074 --> 50:36.234
Listen to me,

50:37.451 --> 50:38.611
in my heart,

50:41.747 --> 50:43.578
there's never been anyone else.

50:50.214 --> 50:51.795
In the future, that won't change.

50:54.260 --> 50:55.750
I'm scared, after this,

50:59.098 --> 51:01.259
I won't have another chance to tell you.

51:15.698 --> 51:16.528
Goodbye.

51:48.022 --> 51:48.761
Life Snatcher,

51:48.814 --> 51:49.769
everything's ready.

51:49.815 --> 51:51.305
Good. Let's go!

51:54.445 --> 51:55.560
Be careful.

52:11.003 --> 52:11.992
Here,

52:12.463 --> 52:13.669
have some sweet soup.

52:19.094 --> 52:20.379
Nice!

52:21.388 --> 52:22.423
Thank you.

52:29.104 --> 52:30.685
It's good.

52:33.942 --> 52:35.182
Really sweet.

52:36.028 --> 52:37.188
Yayu,

52:37.363 --> 52:38.569
it's good, rig ht?

52:45.704 --> 52:48.491
Yayu, do you remember, when you were young,

52:48.540 --> 52:50.952
I told you the story of black and white?

53:00.010 --> 53:03.377
Mixing different colors of light makes white,

53:05.766 --> 53:08.883
mixing different colors of pigment makes black.

53:09.103 --> 53:10.092
Right.

53:10.979 --> 53:14.267
Black and white have a common value.

53:14.316 --> 53:17.058
There is white in black, and black in white.

53:18.278 --> 53:20.314
It's quite a moving idea.

53:20.906 --> 53:22.612
You don't separate black and white.

53:22.658 --> 53:24.649
Good people and bad people are the same.

53:26.036 --> 53:29.028
I just said people's nature is the same.

53:29.498 --> 53:32.661
No one is completely good, or completely bad.

53:33.001 --> 53:35.743
Good people and bad people
all have a good side,

53:36.088 --> 53:37.544
and all make mistakes.

53:37.589 --> 53:38.669
I do.

53:38.716 --> 53:40.206
Everyone does.

53:40.718 --> 53:41.878
DO you?

53:41.927 --> 53:44.088
I thought you were always right.

53:51.895 --> 53:55.058
I always make you angry.

53:56.734 --> 53:58.474
That's wrong of me.

53:59.945 --> 54:01.185
People...

54:01.947 --> 54:04.404
shouldn't hold on to grudges forever.

54:07.578 --> 54:09.739
What we're missing around here

54:09.788 --> 54:12.279
are people who can make grudges disappear.

54:13.792 --> 54:15.783
I hope you can become one.

54:20.883 --> 54:22.999
I used to separate black and white.

54:24.344 --> 54:26.710
I was light, I beat back the dark.

54:31.435 --> 54:32.550
But...

54:33.979 --> 54:35.389
But now...

54:36.815 --> 54:38.897
my best friend Iron Hands

54:39.985 --> 54:41.441
is my enemy.

54:44.114 --> 54:45.820
The Emperor I hate,

54:46.658 --> 54:48.239
when I caught him,

54:48.494 --> 54:50.200
I Couldn't kill him.

54:51.789 --> 54:53.529
I can't do anything.

54:55.459 --> 54:56.665
I really...

54:57.252 --> 54:58.537
I really don't know how to judge things.

55:02.132 --> 55:04.965
You've judged without even acting.

55:06.720 --> 55:10.258
The world is very difficult to understand.

55:11.183 --> 55:12.593
But you know that.

55:12.684 --> 55:13.639
You're an adult now.

55:13.936 --> 55:15.472
I don't want to grow up.

55:16.688 --> 55:18.474
And I don't want to understand.

55:20.984 --> 55:21.973
I want to escape.

55:27.032 --> 55:28.818
Intelligent people

55:28.867 --> 55:31.028
all want to escape after they grow up.

55:31.119 --> 55:33.280
But I hope you'll be like me,

55:33.330 --> 55:35.070
someone not intelligent.

55:35.457 --> 55:36.697
I don't know how to do that.

55:36.959 --> 55:38.369
Neither do I.

55:40.921 --> 55:42.582
Do you want to eat or not?

55:45.926 --> 55:48.133
Do you really think I can change that much?

55:48.178 --> 55:50.544
All I know how to do is try.

55:53.058 --> 55:53.922
This is good.

55:53.976 --> 55:55.716
What do you think of Ji Yaohua?

55:58.564 --> 55:59.849
Apparently...

56:04.069 --> 56:06.606
Apparently we can't trust her that much.

56:07.114 --> 56:09.025
She's the chief of Department Six.

56:09.074 --> 56:11.065
She controls the capital,

56:12.035 --> 56:14.242
the situation is tacky.

56:18.876 --> 56:20.582
But she killed An Shigeng,

56:21.879 --> 56:23.415
and she saved Lingqi.

56:31.513 --> 56:33.299
Really, white in black

56:34.474 --> 56:36.135
and black in white.

57:04.504 --> 57:06.290
I made you another prosthesis.

57:07.758 --> 57:08.964
This one should be easier to use.

57:10.260 --> 57:12.501
You'll just have to use
a little more mind power.

57:16.808 --> 57:17.797
I'll help you put them on.

57:30.614 --> 57:31.694
I'll do it myself.

57:51.009 --> 57:52.374
You can't go in!

57:52.636 --> 57:54.592
I'm talking to you! Did you hear me?!

57:54.638 --> 57:57.471
Hey! What do you want here?!

57:58.058 --> 58:00.640
Chief Ji understands that you're short of help.

58:00.686 --> 58:01.766
During the curfew,

58:01.812 --> 58:04.645
Department Six guards will ensure
the Divine Constabu|ary's safety.

58:14.533 --> 58:15.693
You see?

58:15.909 --> 58:18.070
It's obvious they're spying on us.

58:19.413 --> 58:23.281
Should I have Big Wolf
put some drugs in their tea?

58:24.126 --> 58:25.036
Forget it.

58:25.085 --> 58:26.495
We don't have enough outhouses for the bodies.

58:26.670 --> 58:28.331
All of you, stay alert.

58:28.630 --> 58:29.494
Watch them in shifts.

58:29.715 --> 58:30.750
OK.

58:42.894 --> 58:44.885
I have something to announce.

58:46.356 --> 58:47.892
Aunt Poise and I

58:48.692 --> 58:50.057
are getting married.

58:53.697 --> 58:55.312
It's time.

58:57.200 --> 58:59.862
There is going to be a huge change
in these few days.

59:00.162 --> 59:01.868
The time to fight is coming.

59:05.167 --> 59:06.782
I don't want to regret it.

59:26.188 --> 59:27.598
If you die,

59:28.774 --> 59:30.184
I won't want to live.

59:32.778 --> 59:34.359
And if I don't die,

59:34.905 --> 59:37.021
I want you to outlive me.

59:39.701 --> 59:40.941
Take care out there.

59:42.412 --> 59:44.073
‘Til death do us part.

59:48.668 --> 59:50.124
Mr. Zhuge,

59:51.922 --> 59:53.287
have you seen Coldblood?

59:53.548 --> 59:54.412
Miss Ji,

59:54.466 --> 59:55.922
do you need something?

59:57.969 --> 01:00:00.335
I've learned that
Minister Cai's men left the city.

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:01.962
I don't know where they went.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.849
Does he know something about the Emperor?

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.595
I just hope the Emperor hasn't taken Coldblood

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:11.354
to find the troops outside the city.

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:12.931
They're in Minister Cai's pocket.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.566
Really?

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:19.111
I'm sure Lengqi knows what he's doing.

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:21.148
Come in. Have some dinner.

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:27.157
Goodbye.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:30.156
Wait.

01:00:37.008 --> 01:00:38.168
Miss Ji,

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.547
if you want to tell the truth,

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.300
this is your last chance.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:47.924
If you don't believe me,

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.681
you can read my mind.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.390
I already did.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:02.610
Then you should know what I'm thinking.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.952
My skills aren't that accurate.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.582
But I know you care about Coldblood.

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.294
I know you won't hurt him.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.672
You're not afraid I'll steal him?

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:30.717
I've never worried about that.

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:40.436
Believe me, he really is in danger.

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:41.565
Please.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:01.422
Youxia...

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:02.378
Master.

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:04.258
You stay here and protect them.

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:09.927
I'll be back soon.

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:15.141
Let's go.

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:31.573
Here, have some more.

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.576
You eat.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.385
Why did everyone leave?

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:57.599
Chief Ji has orders!

01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:59.105
Burn Divine Constabulary!

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:01.728
Don't let anyone escape!

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:03.772
Did you hear me?

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.570
Don't let anyone escape!

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:07.818
Pull!

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:09.115
Release!

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.536
Here's the liquor!

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.664
Do you think

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:22.916
he'll make a good Emperor?

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.843
Can I have something to eat?

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.925
Well, I trust him.

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:38.470
I hope he's right.

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:39.892
Do you have any silver?

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:40.896
Yeah.

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:43.148
Buy everything at the market.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:45.106
I want to give it to the starving people.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:47.778
Buy all of it?! How much would that cost?

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:50.152
Do you know how many beggars there are here?

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.116
That's an imperial decree.

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:53.067
Your...

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.785
Your Majesty,

01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:00.541
surviving this trip will take secrecy.

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:01.413
If we do this,

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:02.828
you're exposing us,

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:03.620
and

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.083
that‘ll be the last of any majesty of yours,

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:06.088
alright?

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:12.512
Guys, I want to say thank you.

01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:13.637
Don't worry about it!

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:14.672
What is it?

01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:16.850
He wants to feed all the beggars.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:27.853
Interested?

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.239
I'm curious,

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:41.658
are all common women

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:42.868
|ike...|ike that?

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:44.289
Like what?

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.877
Temperamental, direct, disobedient!

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:50.007
The women in the palace

01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:51.551
wouldn't ever treat me like that.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:54.254
Women, who knows?

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:55.842
They're complicated.

01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:58.929
That Miss Sheng is the same.

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:02.311
I find her very interesting.

01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:04.897
It's a shame she's a cripple.

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:06.767
You like her?

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:10.695
Excuse me?!

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:25.577
Look out!

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:34.127
Hurry! Protect them!

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:39.173
Go!

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:45.680
Move!

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:05.097
Lingqi!

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:08.850
Ml’. Zhuge!

01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:12.187
I'm flattered you made time to compete with me.

01:07:12.403 --> 01:07:14.769
Your woman is in hell now.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:16.900
She'll be waiting for you.

01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:22.527
Ji Yaohua

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:25.496
is my family's best servant.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.711
And you recognize this?

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:35.373
You're all that's left

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.751
of the Divine Constabulary!

01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:39.548
You two go find the rest of them!

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:41.713
Hurry!

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:10.917
Protect the Emperor! Go!

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:30.428
Master!

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:31.349
Go!

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.296
A lifetime of chi reserves, Mr. Zhuge.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:03.886
Thank you.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.063
Life Snatcher.

01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:16.648
Thank you.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.027
How is it? Here, let me see.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:21.653
I'll go out and look.

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.026
OK. Be careful.

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:56.355
Can someone tell me

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:02.569
that they're not all dead?!

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.026
That this is just a bad dream?!

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:18.540
I want them to come back.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:28.755
I want to tell Iron Hands,

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:37.221
I forgive him,

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:44.362
that we can start over again.

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:51.410
I believed Ji Yaohua.

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:56.202
I believed her

01:11:01.632 --> 01:11:03.497
because I didn't want to hate her,

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.842
because I wanted to forgive.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:08.962
But look

01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:12.840
what I've done!

01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:22.642
—Yayu...
-Tell me!

01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:25.895
—Tell me!
-Don't be like this.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.447
This is all a dream, right?

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:34.487
Yayu,

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:36.285
just listen to me, alright?

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:38.412
Do you understand? You've done nothing wrong.

01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:41.210
You shouldn't blame yourself.

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:46.795
You have to realize,

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:49.168
if they knew you blamed yourself,

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:52.046
they would feel terrible.

01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:00.642
What's so good about me,

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:02.473
that you follow me everywhere?

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:05.522
There's nothing good about you, that's why.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:07.653
And I'm just about the same.

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:09.943
Hey, let's go get some water.

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:10.989
OK.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.327
I have some food here. Want some?

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:23.328
Life Snatcher! Who...who is he?

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.750
Him?

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.299
You don't know my title?

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:29.959
Title?

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.128
He has a title?

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:33.596
The Emperor!

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:35.343
-The Emperor?
-What?!

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.597
Then why are you risking your lives
to protect me’?

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:41.554
Not everyone wants to bask
in the imperial halo,

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.061
or wants to gain something from you.

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:48.519
They are here for their friend,

01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:50.689
to do the right thing!

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.160
Life Snatcher asked them to protect someone,

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.700
so they came.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:00.493
It's that simple.

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:02.700
Someone like you

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.251
wouldn't understand.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:07.000
What do we do next?

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:10.333
All we can do

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:13.256
is take me to General Di as soon as possible,

01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:14.678
and take him back to the city.

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:18.132
Ji Yaohua said General Di
is Minister Cai's man.

01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:20.259
And you believe what she told you?

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.390
You have to believe me,

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:24.605
I can still win this fight for you!

01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:26.398
I will avenge

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:28.100
Lord Zhuge's life for all of you!

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.187
Why should we believe you'll save us?!

01:13:31.616 --> 01:13:33.231
Do you know how many people died for you?

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:34.361
Why should we believe you?!

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:36.741
-What did you say?NAME?

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.403
If it weren't for your indulgence,

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:39.741
we wouldn't be here today!

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.246
Don't I want to wipe out the traitors?

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:42.998
I've been looking for proof.

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:44.333
You're incompetent.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:45.918
I'm incompetent?

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:48.587
If not for the peace of my kingdom,

01:13:48.799 --> 01:13:50.539
why would I tolerate them?

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.091
Who ever thinks about how it hurts me?

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:53.213
Does it hurt you?

01:13:53.304 --> 01:13:54.919
Then get off the throne!

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.008
You traitor!

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.510
I'll kill you!

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:09.521
He is my enemy.

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:14.772
But if I kill him,

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.116
even more innocent people will die.

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.498
With Lord Zhuge's last words

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:27.039
he asked us to escort the Emperor.

01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:33.879
You don't have to trust this man,

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.131
but you should trust Zhuge Zhengwo!

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.133
If he wants to go die,

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:45.970
then our job is to go die with him!

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.556
Soldiers!

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:51.642
A lot of soldiers are coming!

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.151
Well, looks like this is it!

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:57.402
You guys should go first.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:58.778
Coming all this way just to leave?

01:14:58.828 --> 01:14:59.692
What kind of friends are we?

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:00.734
Yeah!

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:25.643
Do we have any other choice?

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:44.703
We've done it!

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:46.993
We're marching into the palace.

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:48.456
My son,

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.705
I want you to be Emperor!

01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:56.673
Do you remember the game we played
when I was young?

01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:01.344
We pretended to be wooden dolls.

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.131
We weren't allowed to talk,

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:07.135
OF ITIOVB.

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:21.324
I believed that our desire moved the world.

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:31.744
But now I know desire is rashness.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:56.601
You never learn, do you?!

01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:59.486
You make me ashamed!

01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:39.203
Welcome His Majesty's safe return!

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:42.714
Through fortune, courage, and prowess,

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.172
he personally captured traitor Zhuge Zhengwo,

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:47.594
and preserved peace for his people!

01:18:48.432 --> 01:18:49.342
Rise!

01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:52.141
Our thanks, Your Majesty.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:17.286
What pains me most

01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:19.626
is watching my people suffer

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.714
because I let treacherous ministers
fight for power.

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:26.879
I am unworthy

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:29.970
of the title of Emperor.

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:35.760
So I have decided to give it up.

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:41.106
I wish to abdicate to Lord An.

01:19:42.903 --> 01:19:44.234
Your Majesty, please reconsider!

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:46.733
Retract your edict!

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:50.153
Your Majesty, no!

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:53.785
This is too rash!

01:19:57.167 --> 01:20:00.204
If Lord An takes the throne,

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:03.420
the kingdom and people will benefit.

01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:13.715
I fear the kingdom won't accept me!

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:23.023
Lord An's integrity is known to all,

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:26.686
and the Emperor abdicates to him!

01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:32.491
Who would dare question it?

01:20:33.203 --> 01:20:35.489
Who would dare disobey?

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.327
Your Majesty's reign has been disorderly.

01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:46.538
Corrupt officials hold power

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:49.045
and bleed the state.

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.594
If we desire peace,

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.672
the root of corruption must be removed!

01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:59.560
There was one insolent whelp
who stirred up rumors of assassination.

01:21:00.105 --> 01:21:01.265
Today,

01:21:02.232 --> 01:21:04.689
I intend to see that he pays!

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.192
You traitor!

01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:08.773
I was loyal to you...|...

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:32.880
I thought...| did was had to be done,

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:35.429
and endured so many insults.

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:38.178
Why would you do this to me?

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:41.727
You've enjoyed so much

01:21:42.106 --> 01:21:44.062
wealth and luxury.

01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:45.730
If you don't die,

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:49.018
I lose credibility.

01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:55.858
Thank you for your service.

01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:09.421
He's not the only traitor present!

01:22:11.135 --> 01:22:12.420
Guards!

01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:14.675
Bring in Zhuge Zhengwo!

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:33.149
Who ordered his bonds loosened?

01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:43.447
-What's going on?NAM E?

01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:49.123
What I was looking for that day

01:22:50.007 --> 01:22:51.668
wasn't a cure for the poison,

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:54.170
it was the antidote to your spell.

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:56.794
So you didn't care about your life.

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.722
Everyone, get behind me!

01:23:02.269 --> 01:23:03.600
An Yunshan, for the crime of treason,

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.643
Department Six places you under arrest!

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:19.650
Quite a show!

01:23:19.953 --> 01:23:20.817
Quite a show!

01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:22.031
Quite an incredible show.

01:23:25.792 --> 01:23:27.157
You killed Minister Cai,

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:31.291
so it seems I won't be needing General Di

01:23:31.798 --> 01:23:33.083
to prove the Minister's guilt.

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.843
Did you really think I was dead?

01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:40.762
You should understand,

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:44.262
money can't buy everyone.

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:48.512
No matter how much you gave General Di,

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:50.305
he reported everything to me,

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:54.355
because we are friends
who would die for each other!

01:23:57.407 --> 01:24:00.149
And luckily Ji Yaohua informed us

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:05.241
so we could come back in time to see your show.

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:12.585
Everyone listen!

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:16.624
My army has occupied the palace.

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:19.794
Because most of you were lied to by An Yunshan,

01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:21.427
if you surrender now,

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:24.423
will be lenient!

01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:43.029
Make sure everyone gets out safely!

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.266
Come on, quick!

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:54.205
Let me go.

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:56.874
I'll give you the antidote.

01:26:57.462 --> 01:26:59.248
You're still the woman I trained with.

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:01.046
You killed the Sheriff King.

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:02.623
I can't let you go.

01:27:03.844 --> 01:27:07.007
You and I are both going to hell.

01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:10.005
The question is who goes first,

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.839
right?

01:27:27.617 --> 01:27:28.356
Careful!

01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:12.401
I'll find the antidote.

01:28:13.079 --> 01:28:14.285
Save it.

01:28:33.433 --> 01:28:35.139
Aunt Poise and her people are fine.

01:28:35.852 --> 01:28:36.887
Don't worry.

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:44.816
It won't help.

01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:48.319
Emotionless...

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.065
Don't...

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:54.575
Don't lose him.

01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:57.154
And...

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:01.491
help me take care of...

01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:04.369
my sisters...

01:30:28.465 --> 01:30:29.375
Shield formation!

01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:13.881
-You 0kay?NAME?

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.282
Careful, he can absorb our power!

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:44.153
I don't care. He's going down.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.570
-So evil!
—Your Majesty!

01:33:06.664 --> 01:33:07.870
It's dangerous here!

01:33:07.957 --> 01:33:08.867
I'll hold him off,

01:33:08.958 --> 01:33:10.198
you get out of here.

01:33:11.002 --> 01:33:13.209
You've always wanted me to be a good emperor.

01:33:13.463 --> 01:33:14.373
If I go now,

01:33:14.464 --> 01:33:15.795
I'm nothing but a coward.

01:33:15.882 --> 01:33:17.247
No one will call me emperor then.

01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:18.089
Attack!

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.466
Die!

01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:04.210
If you want to kill him,

01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:06.880
you'll have to step over our dead bodies.

01:34:07.183 --> 01:34:09.469
Would I not make

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:11.885
a better ruler than this waste?

01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:14.020
Obey me,

01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:17.649
and both you and the nation benefit.

01:34:18.194 --> 01:34:19.775
The world

01:34:20.697 --> 01:34:24.030
doesn't need men who consider life worthless!

01:34:24.367 --> 01:34:25.857
What are a few lives

01:34:26.119 --> 01:34:29.077
in the pursuit of something grand?

01:34:29.873 --> 01:34:32.114
Stepping over our dead bodies...

01:34:36.087 --> 01:34:37.702
If you want to fight me

01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:40.459
look at what you're capable of first.

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:42.840
Wait. Don't forget me.

01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:45.502
It looks like I'm the only one
who can beat you.

01:34:51.644 --> 01:34:53.600
I've taken all your power, you're a shell!

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:54.803
How would you fight me?

01:34:55.565 --> 01:34:57.476
Nothing is more powerful

01:34:58.067 --> 01:35:00.058
than having nothing left to lose.

01:35:02.864 --> 01:35:04.479
Your greed knows no bounds.

01:35:05.408 --> 01:35:06.648
But now strength from every faction

01:35:06.743 --> 01:35:08.984
is clashing within you.

01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:11.368
You won't survive.

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:18.167
A delusional fantasy!

01:35:19.923 --> 01:35:21.629
Brag when you have the power!

01:35:41.486 --> 01:35:43.317
I have nothing left to lose.

01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:31.274
Are you alright?

01:36:31.494 --> 01:36:32.483
I'm fine.

01:36:35.915 --> 01:36:36.870
Uncle!

01:37:04.527 --> 01:37:05.642
I am worse than useless.

01:37:06.195 --> 01:37:08.277
A moment of impulsiveness

01:37:08.364 --> 01:37:10.150
brought me to defeat.

01:37:10.241 --> 01:37:11.651
I beg forgiveness.

01:37:11.701 --> 01:37:12.986
Forgive me!

01:37:14.078 --> 01:37:15.193
You abase yourself.

01:37:16.247 --> 01:37:18.329
The rebels are eliminated,

01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:19.823
and you did more than anyone.

01:37:20.126 --> 01:37:22.913
How is your recovery coming along?

01:37:22.962 --> 01:37:24.168
Your Majesty,

01:37:24.589 --> 01:37:27.752
my power will return in time.

01:37:28.926 --> 01:37:31.008
Perfect.

01:37:32.722 --> 01:37:34.087
The Divine Constabulary

01:37:34.307 --> 01:37:36.673
was key in stopping this rebellion.

01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:38.682
Name your reward,

01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:41.310
and I will see it granted.

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:44.226
None of us require a reward.

01:37:45.026 --> 01:37:46.186
To obey your orders

01:37:46.235 --> 01:37:48.897
and preserve peace for the people is enough.

01:37:50.615 --> 01:37:53.857
But Department Six's sacrifice

01:37:54.911 --> 01:37:56.367
WES grave.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.035
Yes.

01:37:58.873 --> 01:38:00.363
I have decided to

01:38:00.666 --> 01:38:03.749
give Department Six to Leng Lingqi.

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:05.376
Lord Leng.

01:38:08.299 --> 01:38:10.381
I think, with you in charge of Department Six,

01:38:10.927 --> 01:38:13.213
Lord Liu's spirit in heaven

01:38:13.638 --> 01:38:15.128
will finally be able to rest.

01:38:16.849 --> 01:38:18.714
If there is another case at court

01:38:19.102 --> 01:38:20.808
where the law is violated,

01:38:21.771 --> 01:38:23.853
does Department Six have the right
to investigate?

01:38:25.525 --> 01:38:26.230
Of course!

01:38:26.484 --> 01:38:28.145
If it has something to do with you,

01:38:28.319 --> 01:38:29.229
can we investigate you?

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.112
Yes! I demand you investigate.

01:38:37.787 --> 01:38:40.745
Royals and commoners are equal under the law.

01:38:41.457 --> 01:38:42.913
Are you satisfied now?

01:38:44.877 --> 01:38:46.208
Thank you, Your Majesty.

01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:02.641
Interested?

01:39:04.355 --> 01:39:05.435
Of course!

01:39:09.485 --> 01:39:10.565
Good stuff!

01:39:23.374 --> 01:39:24.830
I'm enough of a friend, aren't I?

01:39:38.598 --> 01:39:39.678
Miss Sheng,

01:39:40.433 --> 01:39:43.300
I need to speak with you.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.360
Miss Sheng,

01:40:00.369 --> 01:40:01.825
this rebellion

01:40:02.705 --> 01:40:07.039
revealed many truths to us.

01:40:11.464 --> 01:40:12.749
Twelve years ago,

01:40:13.758 --> 01:40:17.046
Minister Cai wanted your father dead,

01:40:18.638 --> 01:40:20.720
so he fabricated charges of treason.

01:40:22.558 --> 01:40:27.473
Your father was never disloyal.

01:40:32.652 --> 01:40:36.736
The day I ordered your family killed,

01:40:39.742 --> 01:40:40.902
Iwas wrong.

01:40:52.463 --> 01:40:54.328
I was used by treacherous men.

01:40:57.718 --> 01:40:59.208
If you want to avenge your family,

01:41:00.846 --> 01:41:05.431
I find that reasonable.

01:41:20.866 --> 01:41:23.323
All that matters now is
that the truth is exposed.

01:41:31.043 --> 01:41:33.079
The order to kill an entire family

01:41:34.171 --> 01:41:38.005
is one I'll never use again.

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:42.668
I'll come back to have hotpot with you.

01:42:02.992 --> 01:42:04.027
Let's go.

01:42:14.003 --> 01:42:15.118
What is it?

01:42:17.089 --> 01:42:18.454
Where there are shadows,

01:42:19.383 --> 01:42:20.623
there is light.
