WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:03.545
[bright tone]

00:05.380 --> 00:07.048
- Hey, do you have a sec?
- Mm-hmm.

00:07.048 --> 00:08.508
Uh, so we were talking
about something

00:08.508 --> 00:10.051
in my management class
last night.

00:10.051 --> 00:11.511
Did you guys know we're behind

00:11.511 --> 00:13.013
most of the other
auto companies in green tech?

00:13.013 --> 00:16.391
We got a slow start on EVs,
thanks to a previous CEO.

00:16.391 --> 00:17.726
Yeah,
my grandfather always said,

00:17.726 --> 00:20.186
"Electric cars are
for European sissies."

00:20.186 --> 00:21.688
And I know that sounds bad,

00:21.688 --> 00:23.356
but he didn't mean people
from Europe.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.524
He meant effeminate men.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.984
I'm pretty sure that's worse.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.570
Well, this analyst was
talking to our class about it,

00:28.570 --> 00:30.905
and she says that every time
a auto company announces

00:30.905 --> 00:33.867
a green initiative,
the stock price shoots up.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.076
- Well...
- Yeah.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.203
We do need
to boost our stock price.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.205
Have I told you about
the sacrifice that I made

00:39.205 --> 00:40.707
- to save your jobs?
- You did.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.000
Oh, no, I just didn't know
if you were there

00:42.000 --> 00:44.002
- when I told everyone, so--
- We were all there.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.628
It was pretty selfless,
so okay.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.547
Well, yeah.
Let's announce it.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.382
What exactly am I announcing?

00:49.382 --> 00:52.218
Say we're investing 2 billion
into EV

00:52.218 --> 00:54.721
with plans
to go completely green by,

00:54.721 --> 00:55.764
I don't know, 2040?

00:55.764 --> 00:57.098
And are we actually
going green

00:57.098 --> 00:58.516
or just announcing it?

00:58.516 --> 01:00.393
Um, both.
We'll put the press release out

01:00.393 --> 01:02.771
now for the stock bump,
and you take all the time

01:02.771 --> 01:04.606
that you need
designing your solar wheels

01:04.606 --> 01:06.983
or an engine that runs
on hot-dog water

01:06.983 --> 01:08.234
or whatever gets you hard.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.403
- Everyone's happy.
- Does $2 billion--

01:10.403 --> 01:12.072
does that sound a little fake, though,

01:12.072 --> 01:14.074
like Dr. Evil or something?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.825
- Do not.
- Well, you could say

01:15.825 --> 01:17.535
like $1.7 billion.

01:17.535 --> 01:18.870
Oh, yeah. No, that's good.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.330
It'll look like we tried
to reach 2 billion

01:20.330 --> 01:21.331
- but couldn't.
- [sighs]

01:21.331 --> 01:23.124
Oh, my God, fine. Do it.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.585
[as Dr. Evil]
$2 million.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.797
- Billion.
- $2 billion.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.841
Zip it.

Did you see this?

01:40.141 --> 01:41.559
Our stock's already up
four points.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.103
- It totally worked.
- I saw.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.270
We should do
a second announcement

01:44.270 --> 01:45.522
and see if the price
goes up even more.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.690
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.149
The stock price is up
four points.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.275
- I saw.
- Let's do a second

01:49.275 --> 01:50.318
announcement.
It'll boost the price

01:50.318 --> 01:51.695
- even more.
- I said the same thing.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.446
How do we justify
a second press release

01:53.446 --> 01:55.615
on the same day
about the same thing?

01:55.615 --> 01:58.159
Uh, it's green stuff
so, uh, climate change?

01:58.159 --> 01:59.577
Oh, yeah. That's perfect.

01:59.577 --> 02:00.912
- Hmm.
- "As the situation

02:00.912 --> 02:02.288
"with climate change evolves,

02:02.288 --> 02:03.915
so must our plans," et cetera.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.709
Uh, make sure that you use
the word "unprecedented."

02:05.709 --> 02:06.835
- Ooh, that's nice.
- Sure.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.671
And say we're investing
3.27 billion.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.006
- Oh.
- And we'll be green

02:11.006 --> 02:12.590
- by the year--
- Uh, 2030.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.342
- Love it.
- Okay, anything earlier

02:14.342 --> 02:16.302
than 2035 is gonna sound crazy.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.555
Can we at least say 2034?

02:18.555 --> 02:21.141
- Okay, 2034.
- 2033?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.101
Fine, 2034.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.270
Sounds like you're learning
a lot in that program.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.897
You know, I was never
into academics as a kid,

02:27.897 --> 02:30.692
but this stuff is--
is actually really interesting.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.819
Well, I'm very happy for you.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.322
Like in my last class, there
was an example of a company,

02:36.322 --> 02:37.866
- Merlin Enterprises.
- Uh-huh.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.284
And Merlin makes widgets.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.660
But one day they decided

02:40.660 --> 02:42.704
that they also wanna make
scrunchems, right?

02:42.704 --> 02:44.080
Right, yeah.
Well, I gotta go--

02:44.080 --> 02:45.206
It's all made-up.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.708
There is no Merlin Enterprises.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.668
But for the sake
of the example, I--

02:48.668 --> 02:49.961
John! [exhales]

02:49.961 --> 02:51.755
[softly] Sorry, I gotta go deal
with this.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.465
[laughs] John!

02:53.465 --> 02:56.217
We gotta go over some stuff.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.263
He really wanted
to get away from you.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.681
Thank you, Dale.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.183
You click Refresh.
You've got the magic touch.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.559
Okay.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.519
- Oh! Up six cents.
- Whoa, hey, hey! Yes.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.687
We're up another point
and a half.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.314
Hey, we gotta do
a third announcement.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.191
We have to.
The stock market is obsessed

03:11.191 --> 03:12.567
with us right now,
like so horny.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.985
Right, um, I just got a call

03:13.985 --> 03:15.320
from "The Wall Street Journal."

03:15.320 --> 03:16.696
Good news is, they think

03:16.696 --> 03:18.406
that everything we're saying
is super exciting.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.908
Uh, no doy,
"Wall Street Journal."

03:19.908 --> 03:21.201
I was just about to say that.
I was just about to say

03:21.201 --> 03:22.994
- "No doy."
- But they're also curious

03:22.994 --> 03:26.247
to know specifically
what we're doing in terms of,

03:26.247 --> 03:28.041
- you know, going green.
- Already?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.751
We just announced this thing.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.753
Well, if we don't give them
any specifics,

03:31.753 --> 03:33.129
it'll seem like we're all talk,

03:33.129 --> 03:35.048
and our stock price'll go
back down to where it was,

03:35.048 --> 03:36.925
probably lower, actually.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.221
Cyrus! Get in here!

03:41.221 --> 03:43.264
You know, they wouldn't be
doing this if I was a man.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.974
- Holding you accountable?
- Mm-hmm.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.601
You know my office has
a phone, right?

03:46.601 --> 03:47.811
We need to give
"The Wall Street Journal"

03:47.811 --> 03:49.604
some specifics
on the new green initiative.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.564
- What do you got so far?
- The initiative you asked me

03:51.564 --> 03:53.692
to start thinking about
roughly three hours ago?

03:53.692 --> 03:54.984
- Not a whole lot.
- What have you been doing

03:54.984 --> 03:56.194
- this whole time?
- Sorry.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.404
It might take me a whole week

03:57.404 --> 03:59.489
to solve
the global energy crisis.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.241
What if we invest
in some green tech,

04:01.241 --> 04:02.909
like the other companies
we're developing?

04:02.909 --> 04:04.285
Yeah,
that'd show "Wall Street"

04:04.285 --> 04:05.912
that we're serious at least.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.206
We have
an untapped acquisition fund.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.332
- Mm.
- And I know about some

04:09.332 --> 04:10.834
promising start-ups
in Silicon Valley.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.253
- Great. Make us a list.
- Okay.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.755
Looks like
we're going shopping!

04:15.755 --> 04:18.383
Cha-ching,
a little retail therapy.

04:18.383 --> 04:19.843
[laughs] Mama likes
to swipe that plastic.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.428
- Mm.
- Just give Mama the cash

04:21.428 --> 04:22.721
and Mama will spend it.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.139
[as a baby]
Mama buy something for baby?

04:24.139 --> 04:25.849
Toy for baby?

04:27.767 --> 04:30.186
Um, let's maybe all just sit
quietly in our offices

04:30.186 --> 04:31.312
for the rest of the day.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.318
This feels good, guys.
We're literally on our way

04:37.986 --> 04:39.154
to help save the planet.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.697
He said while flying
on a private plane,

04:40.697 --> 04:42.490
drinking
from single-use plastic.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.492
So we have meetings set up
with nine start-ups

04:44.492 --> 04:47.328
that are all working
on EV-related technology.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.496
First there's Loband--

04:48.496 --> 04:49.664
I don't need all the details.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.041
This is lottery
ticket investing.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.375
You buy ten.
You hope you get a winner.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.252
Perfect.
Great business model.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.378
We should meet
with my buddy Chase.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.713
He's a huge tech guy.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.214
Oh, I--I doubt
we'll have time.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.632
No, seriously.
He's a disruptor.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.511
Like imagine a version of me,
but in Silicon Valley.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.888
Hmm.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.389
Um, I should probably get
into these.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.266
<i>Everyone, please be
seated for landing.</i>

05:08.266 --> 05:09.934
Well, I hope you all brought
your umbrellas,

05:09.934 --> 05:12.645
'cause we're about
to make it rain on some nerds.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.564
<i>* It's coming up,

05:14.564 --> 05:16.066

05:16.066 --> 05:17.776
We anticipate
that our solar cells

05:17.776 --> 05:20.111
will be able to charge up
to 200% faster

05:20.111 --> 05:21.988
than conventional solar arrays.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.741
So-lar, so good. [laughs]
It's exciting.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.368
How 'bout, uh, 5 million
for 5%?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.786
I know what you're thinking:
this looks like

05:27.786 --> 05:29.496
an ordinary
electrical resolver.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.289
This one is coil-free.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.999
[gasps]

05:32.999 --> 05:35.168
Just kidding, I have no idea
what any of this means.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.170
I want you
to forget everything you know

05:37.170 --> 05:38.505
about water and glycol-based
cooling.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.256
- Done.
- I'm ready to make an offer.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.216
I haven't started
the pitch yet.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.801
Don't sell past the "yes."

05:42.801 --> 05:44.552
The typical design consists
of primary

05:44.552 --> 05:47.764
and secondary coil windings,
but the operative word--

05:47.764 --> 05:49.307
- Design.
- Coil.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.018
With silicon anodes, we see
higher lithium absorption,

05:52.018 --> 05:54.354
as silicon can bind
four lithium ions

05:54.354 --> 05:56.523
- per silicon atom.
- This is game-changing.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.191
- It's a game changer.
- The game has changed.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.068
This'll change the game.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.278
[sighs] I cannot take
much more of this.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.947
So many different types
of nerd,

06:03.947 --> 06:06.282
each with their own
distinct odor.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.159
Well,
our next meeting cancelled.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.245
The company dissolved and laid
off its entire workforce.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.163
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh, that's perfect.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.790
We can meet Chase.
His company is right around

06:13.790 --> 06:15.041
- here.
- Or we could go to

06:15.041 --> 06:16.001
that boba shop that we passed
on the way here.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.127
Oh, I vote for that.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.628
I love me some boba.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.797
- It's so good.
- It's nice to chew a drink.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.465
Guys, come on.
We're meeting with every

06:22.465 --> 06:23.883
company Cyrus wanted to.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.761
- I'm just asking for one.
- Oh, baby brother is jealous.

06:26.761 --> 06:27.971
[whiny] Does baby need a toy?

06:27.971 --> 06:29.931
- [cooing]
- Fine! Forget it.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.307
Uh, message received, okay?

06:31.307 --> 06:33.393
I'm dumb,
and everything I say is stupid.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.519
- Mm-hmm.
- [sighs]

06:34.519 --> 06:36.730
Okay, Wesley,
we'll meet your friend.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.273
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.858
Yes!
You will not regret this.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.484
I personally vouch
for this guy.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.694
Mm.

- Sarah, pump up the AC

06:51.161 --> 06:53.830
because this guy comes in hot.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.623
Uh.
[both laugh]

06:55.623 --> 06:57.167
- My man.
- Yeah.

What in white-boy hell
is this?

06:59.502 --> 07:01.838
Uh, Chase Brody,
this is Katherine Hastings--

07:01.838 --> 07:03.298
Katherine the Great,
I call her.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.800
That's Sexy Sadie,
Jack the Knife,

07:05.800 --> 07:09.429

Well, thanks
for comin' out here, fam.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.058
Yeah, well,
our last pitch cancelled,

07:13.058 --> 07:14.225
so we have a very short window

07:14.225 --> 07:16.061
for a quick, quick meet
and greet.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.520
- Mm-hmm.
- So how do you two

07:17.520 --> 07:19.564
- know each other? [laughs]
- Wesley and I go way back.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.025
I used to cheat off him
in college.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.818
[laughs] Right.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.570
[inhales deeply]

07:25.570 --> 07:26.529
Oh, you're serious.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.074
Yeah, no.
He's got some strengths.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.283
All right, well,
if you guys wanna follow me,

07:30.283 --> 07:32.035
- I can give you the grand tour.
- Oh, great.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.537
We'd love a real quick,
short tour.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.248
Mm, so he's less intelligent
than Wesley.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.708
- God help us.
- Yeah.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.461
Take a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

07:41.461 --> 07:46.216
This is
our chief "sand-gineer,"

07:46.216 --> 07:47.926
Dustin Kregg.
He's like the Woz

07:47.926 --> 07:50.095
to my Jobs.
He does the science.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.888
I do the vision.

07:51.888 --> 07:56.726
Hi...

07:56.726 --> 08:00.063

08:07.779 --> 08:09.489

That stuff we play in
at the beach?

08:13.118 --> 08:15.412
Well,
what if the actual particles

08:15.412 --> 08:19.165
that we drive by
when we drive by the beach

08:19.165 --> 08:22.961

when we drive by the beach?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.716
- What is he talking about?
- I didn't get any of that.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.844
We've learned how to harness
the power of the sun,

08:30.844 --> 08:32.220

08:32.220 --> 08:34.264
Why not the power of sand?

the sandtery.

- For generations--

"built on sand."

Oh, God, that would make me

No, this is fantastic.

<i>[upbeat music]</i>

09:11.134 --> 09:14.095
So here in our lab,
our scientists work

09:14.095 --> 09:16.139
to manipulate the chemistry
of sand

09:16.139 --> 09:18.516
to hold and transfer electricity

09:18.516 --> 09:20.477
using the principles
of physics.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.520
Wow,
that sounds very sciencey.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.856
Yes, I think that physics
is actually the most sciencey

09:24.856 --> 09:26.149
of all the sciences. [laughs]

09:26.149 --> 09:27.525
You guys are being
so annoying right now.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.652
And so over here is
sort of the sand area.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.738
There's thousands
of different types of sand.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.031
It can be finicky.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.783
I was trying to ask
about their financials.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.869
I'm not totally clear
on their business model.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.829
Oh, it's--it's really simple.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.164
We give them money.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.333
They put it in
a Cayman Island bank account.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.752
- We never hear from them again.
- [laughs]

09:45.752 --> 09:47.337
Yeah, they didn't teach us
that one in class yet.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.546
- Mm.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.591
Hey, will you stick close by?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.968
That creepy guy keeps
on staring at me.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.888
Which creepy guy?

09:56.888 --> 09:58.890
Uh, Jack,

09:58.890 --> 10:00.767
the one with the notebook.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.687
He weirds me out. [laughs]

10:03.687 --> 10:05.980
Don't worry.

I won't let him near you.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.527
- Thanks.
- All right, everybody.

10:10.527 --> 10:14.572
I'd like to introduce
to you the future of energy,

10:20.912 --> 10:22.080
You never believe me.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.248
I honestly thought
this was like

10:23.248 --> 10:25.875
a Theranos-type situation.
[both laugh]

10:25.875 --> 10:27.460
I didn't think
it was possible.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.131
How did--how many amp hours
do you get from this much sand?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.716
Hard to say.
This is more of a conceptual

10:32.716 --> 10:35.176
prototype
than an actual working model.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.595
So...

10:37.595 --> 10:40.473
- Yeah.
- Okay, uh, Chase.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.393
This may sound like
a stupid question, I mean...

10:43.393 --> 10:44.769
- No such thing.
- Just so I understand...

10:44.769 --> 10:46.229
Sure.

10:46.229 --> 10:49.357
Is this lamp powered
by this sand?

10:49.357 --> 10:53.278
This particular lamp
is powered by AA batteries,

10:53.278 --> 10:55.155
but this is exactly

10:55.155 --> 10:57.240
how an operational sandtery
will look.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.575
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.160
Anyway, let's jump back
into our civvies

11:00.160 --> 11:01.536
and chat details.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.079
All right?

11:03.079 --> 11:05.206
Well,
that was really something.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.666
Really didn't need
to go to a lab for that.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.251
What was the point
of these suits?

11:08.251 --> 11:09.461
I guess they didn't want us
to contaminate

11:09.461 --> 11:11.212
their nice IKEA lamp.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.422
At least when people sell
you magic beans,

11:12.422 --> 11:13.548
they don't tell you
they haven't cracked

11:13.548 --> 11:15.592
- the bean technology yet.
- [fake laughs]

11:15.592 --> 11:16.968
So they haven't figured out
every detail.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.261
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus, Jesus!

11:18.261 --> 11:20.263
Wesley, why are you naked
under that?

11:20.263 --> 11:21.848
I thought we all were.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.601
Hey, guys. Take a seat.

11:24.601 --> 11:29.773
So now you have seen
the Sandbox revolution.

11:29.773 --> 11:33.860
We here at Sandbox believe
that we can no longer afford

11:33.860 --> 11:36.613
to keep our heads in the sand.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.199
Chase,
I don't need the whole pitch.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.743
Truth is, I think
your technology is a little,

11:41.743 --> 11:44.496
um, hmm--what is the word
that I am looking for?

11:44.496 --> 11:46.164
- Bogus?
- What's a nicer way

11:46.164 --> 11:48.416
- of saying that?
- Hmm. Uh, spurious?

11:48.416 --> 11:50.543
Spurious. Great, spurious.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.339
The tech is spurious, but you
and Wesley are old friends,

11:54.339 --> 11:58.134
so how 'bout we throw you
50 grand for, I don't know,

11:58.134 --> 11:59.469
20%, a million percent?

11:59.469 --> 12:01.262
We're all havin' fun here.
[light laughter]

12:01.262 --> 12:03.348
- $50,000?
- Uh-huh.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.517
Well, um,

12:05.517 --> 12:09.729
thank you for the offer, uh,
but we believe our valuation

12:09.729 --> 12:11.690
to be at 5 billion.

12:11.690 --> 12:12.732
I'm sorry.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.359
I might've gotten sand
in my ears.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.653
Did you say "billion" with a B?

12:16.653 --> 12:19.656
We believe that
with our tech,

12:19.656 --> 12:22.033
we should be able
to garner a significant share--

12:22.033 --> 12:23.785
What tech? You have no tech.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.663
You have the idea
of batteries made out of sand,

12:26.663 --> 12:28.456
which is really just
a couple letters away

12:28.456 --> 12:30.250
from batteries made out
of farts.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.504
Well...

12:34.504 --> 12:36.006
thank you for your interest.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.049
Well, thank you so much
for showing us around.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.468
This has been hilarious,

12:40.468 --> 12:43.513
and I wish you the best of luck
in prison.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.432
So embarrass me in front
of my friend--

12:45.432 --> 12:46.975
was that always your plan or...

12:46.975 --> 12:48.601
Of course not, Wesley.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.228
At least not initially.

12:50.228 --> 12:53.690
Hey, um,
can I have your email?

12:53.690 --> 12:56.276
Oh, I would,
but I don't have email.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.819
[laughs]

12:57.819 --> 13:00.363
Oh, I just--this is just--
I check the weather on this.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.699
- That's just for my weather.
- Oh, okay.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.826
Well, I'm sorry
it didn't work out.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.828
I felt a real connection
with you,

13:06.828 --> 13:09.122
way more
than with the Tesla people.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.709
With the Tes--Tesla.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.878
Huh.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.838
Bet you would've invested
if Cyrus had asked you to.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.257
- Cyrus knows things.
- It's true. I do.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.925
And this place
is super sketchy.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.219
Yeah, I can't believe Tesla's
looking at them.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.013
How do you know Tesla's
looking at them?

13:25.013 --> 13:26.890
The creepy engineer told me.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.309
Weird, Tesla usually has
pretty good instincts

13:29.309 --> 13:30.268
about this stuff.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.686
Tesla?

13:31.686 --> 13:32.812
Hmm.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.981
And that's--that--
that's interesting.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.114
Why would Tesla be interested
in them?

13:44.074 --> 13:45.450
Even if they checked them out,

13:45.450 --> 13:46.576
that doesn't mean they thought
it was worth anything.

13:46.576 --> 13:47.952
Can you find out
what the deal is?

13:47.952 --> 13:49.621
You think Chase is gonna tell
me anything

13:49.621 --> 13:50.997
after the way you insulted him?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.248
Well, if Tesla's looking
at them,

13:52.248 --> 13:53.667
maybe other companies are too?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.002
[gasps]
I used to date a guy at GM.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.337
I could do some fishing.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.380
Okay, great. Call him.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.756
Does anyone know someone
at Ford?

13:59.756 --> 14:01.800
I actually had an on-again,
off-again thing

14:01.800 --> 14:03.718
- with a guy there.
- Oh. Call them too.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.762
Um, anyone know anyone
at Chrysler?

14:05.762 --> 14:07.138
Throuple that went south.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.557
- Ooh, I'll try him.
- How 'bout Volvo?

14:09.557 --> 14:10.975
Not into Swedes, got it.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.727
I know a VC guy
I could check with.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.396
He usually knows
if something has buzz.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.647
I can call
my hedge-fund friend.

14:15.647 --> 14:16.981
We met in business school,
not a throuple.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.733
- No need to slut-shame.
- I can see if the analyst

14:18.733 --> 14:20.068
who spoke to my class has heard
of 'em.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.695
I could reach out
to the "Journal" reporter.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.113
I'll call them.
I need you to see what else

14:23.113 --> 14:24.447
you can squeeze out
of that engineer.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.532
- He's into you, right?
- You want me

14:25.532 --> 14:27.117
to whore myself out
to the weirdo?

14:27.117 --> 14:28.451
Flirt with him.
I'm not saying you should

14:28.451 --> 14:29.869
[bleep] him.
I mean, unless there was

14:29.869 --> 14:31.037
- a connection and you're into--
- Ew.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.747
Jeff Bezos used
to look like a dork,

14:32.747 --> 14:34.916

14:42.340 --> 14:43.758
I've just missed you.

14:43.758 --> 14:46.177
I was thinking about that week
we spent at the beach.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.929
Oh, speaking of beaches,

14:47.929 --> 14:50.015
has GM been talking
to a company called--

14:50.015 --> 14:52.058
Sandbox?
No, that doesn't ring a bell.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.560
It's probably nothing.
I'm just doing

14:53.560 --> 14:55.353
- my due diligence.
- Well, I could ask around

14:55.353 --> 14:56.813
- and call you back.
- Great, thanks.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.774
I'm 99% sure

They're gonna be huge.
They got this game-changing

if there's competition.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.655
All right,
thanks for the tip.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.615
No, no.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.536
Dusty Dustin.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.329
[laughs] No, that's not--

15:13.329 --> 15:14.622
What are you doin' here?

15:14.622 --> 15:17.417
I just felt like I wanted
to see you again,

15:17.417 --> 15:19.502
Big D.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.963
No, it's been way too long
since we talked.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.298
That's what happens
when you ghost someone.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.258
I didn't ghost.
I told you I didn't love you

15:25.258 --> 15:26.509
and then ended contact.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.802
When you spoke
to our class, you said

15:27.802 --> 15:29.137
we can call you with questions?

15:29.137 --> 15:30.555
Can I ask you
about one company?

15:30.555 --> 15:31.973
Sandbox?
Is anyone at the "Journal"

15:31.973 --> 15:33.266
- writing about them?
- Why?

15:33.266 --> 15:34.309
Are you guys making a play?

15:34.309 --> 15:35.977
I'm asking you the questions.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.146
You know that's not how
newspapers work, right?

15:38.146 --> 15:40.190
It was kind of hot before
when you were talking to me

15:40.190 --> 15:41.232
about Tesla.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.650
What else do you know
about them?

15:42.650 --> 15:44.152
They're an automotive
and energy company

15:44.152 --> 15:47.739
founded in July 2003
in San Carlos, California,

15:47.739 --> 15:50.283

- Oh, my God, stop.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.869
Stop it.
You're so funny, Dustin.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.079
[laughs]

15:54.079 --> 15:55.872
- He called you too?
- Yup.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.415
What is going on with him?

15:57.415 --> 15:59.501
And then he was asking me
about some battery company.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.670
Me too. Sandbox.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.713
What's that about?

16:03.713 --> 16:05.173

about an auto company

16:14.933 --> 16:16.685

- You mean Tesla?

16:16.685 --> 16:18.728
Tesla? That's interesting.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.230

Tesla and Payne are
both interested?

16:30.198 --> 16:31.700
Those are just the ones
that I know of.

16:31.700 --> 16:32.951
- Lemme guess, Sandbox?
- Hold on.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.869
Hey, Monica,
I don't think anyone's talking

16:34.869 --> 16:36.371
about anything but them.

16:47.632 --> 16:48.967
I know some of those are
the same companies,

16:48.967 --> 16:50.719
but the point is,
they could've been the answer

16:50.719 --> 16:52.470
to all of our problems
and we missed it.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.889
- Uh, you missed it.
- Is it possible

16:54.889 --> 16:56.725
that we're just buyin'
into the hype?

16:56.725 --> 16:58.143
I mean, you were the one
that said they were trying

16:58.143 --> 16:59.644
- to sell us magic beans.
- Yeah.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.062
And if I remember
that story correctly,

17:01.062 --> 17:02.814
they really were magic beans.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.442
[bleep], we misread
that situation completely.

17:05.442 --> 17:06.943
You misread the situation.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.695
Okay, Wesley, you were right.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.572
Happy?
You were right. I was wrong.

for my lack of tact earlier.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.587
Oh, do you now?

17:25.587 --> 17:26.713
Your vision may have been
too bold

17:26.713 --> 17:28.256
for me to recognize right away.

17:28.256 --> 17:32.218
So how 'bout 200 million
for a 5% stake in Sandbox?

17:32.218 --> 17:34.679
200, that's--that's a lot
of money for, uh--

17:34.679 --> 17:37.390
what did you call us,
a bag of farts?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.934
I think it was actually
a battery made of farts.

that's not even

17:41.311 --> 17:43.438
all that insulting.
That's like a four out of ten.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.940
Well, an hour ago, I would've
jumped at that offer,

17:45.940 --> 17:48.860

You should've listened to me.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.945
