WEBVTT

00:05.439 --> 00:08.576
Ooh, your roof is great.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.511
Are you up here all the time?

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
Well, not at night
because it's against the rules,

00:12.413 --> 00:14.448
so... we should probably go.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.550
Nobody's gonna get in trouble.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.519
Don't be so paranoid.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.322
Oh, God, I don't know. I just
feel like everybody can see us

00:21.355 --> 00:24.058
up here. Maybe we ought
to go downstairs, right?

00:24.092 --> 00:25.393
Oh, my God.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.528
Look at you. You're a prude.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.464
That's why you wouldn't make out
with me in the cab.

00:30.498 --> 00:31.732
Well, uh, we couldn't.

00:31.765 --> 00:35.569
If you remember,
the middle seat belt was broken.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.540
Can you believe
she called me a prude?

00:39.573 --> 00:42.276
She's got a point. I mean, the
craziest place you ever had sex

00:42.310 --> 00:43.444
was in your own house.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.580
Yeah, but it was
in the guest room.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.116
(scoffs)

00:48.149 --> 00:51.552
I'm not a guest there.
That's crazy.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.421
The craziest place I ever had
sex was in the hospital.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.224
The doctor wanted to make sure
it still worked after the...

00:56.257 --> 00:58.426
tractor accident.

00:58.459 --> 01:01.595
Debbie. Debbie,
what's going on around here?

01:01.629 --> 01:03.464
We're only a few days
away from Thanksgiving,

01:03.497 --> 01:06.200
and your mailbox is still
dressed like a ghost.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.701
KIP:
Yeah,

01:07.735 --> 01:09.537
and there's no cornucopia
on the front door.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.672
And why hasn't the big table
been brought up
from the basement?

01:11.705 --> 01:13.874
Where are you going to display
your holiday gourds?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.476
Carol,

01:15.509 --> 01:17.878
there are
no gourds.

01:17.911 --> 01:18.879
Good Lord,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.814
not one gourd.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.284
Um, actually, Mom,
Adam and I decided

01:23.317 --> 01:25.819
that it might be nice this year
to forgo the Miller tradition

01:25.853 --> 01:27.488
of food and fighting
and get back

01:27.521 --> 01:29.157
to the true meaning
of Thanksgiving.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.625
Yeah. We want to show Mikayla
how we used to celebrate

01:31.659 --> 01:32.860
on the commune.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.262
By pressing hard on your eyelids

01:34.295 --> 01:35.663
and watching
all the flashing dots?

01:36.697 --> 01:39.533
That's Fourth of July.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.535
No, we're gonna go
to an Indian reservation

01:41.569 --> 01:43.571
and exchange tokens
of friendship.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.573
But Thanksgiving
is the one time of year--

01:45.606 --> 01:47.241
besides Easter, Memorial Day,

01:47.275 --> 01:49.510
the period between Christmas
and New Year's, all summer,

01:49.543 --> 01:51.579
and every family member's
birth week--

01:51.612 --> 01:53.547
that I ask us all
to be together.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.817
You know what, if Debbie
doesn't have to be there,

01:56.850 --> 01:59.553
then I shouldn't either.
Excuse me?

01:59.587 --> 02:02.323
I'm sorry, but I don't have
to play by the rules anymore.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.592
If I am going to attract
a nontraditional kind of woman,

02:04.625 --> 02:07.195
then I need to start acting
like that kind of man.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.197
Okay? So maybe...

02:09.230 --> 02:11.499
I should have
a nontraditional Thanksgiving.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.900
You're lucky
there are no gourds around

02:12.933 --> 02:15.903
because I would shove one
in your mouth right now.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.339
It's not an empty threat.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.507
She gourded me last year.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.641
Can I come to your house?

02:20.674 --> 02:23.677
Yeah. Yeah, you know what,
you and Ray can both come.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.546
And maybe I'll invite Kate over,
too.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.415
Maybe I'll take her up
to the roof and show her

02:27.448 --> 02:30.184
and my neighbors how not uptight
the new Nathan is.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.820
So you're all
gonna abandon me?

02:32.853 --> 02:35.756
Like I'm Detroit?

02:35.789 --> 02:37.291
You know what, Carol,
forget them.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.526
We'll have our own Thanksgiving,

02:38.559 --> 02:41.462
just the two of us. We were
the life of this party anyway.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.863
Watch, watch, pretend we're
not here for a second.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.598
Watch this.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.569
You see?

02:48.602 --> 02:51.872
Without us, they're all
standing around like, "Huh?"

02:51.905 --> 02:53.541
You're welcome to have it here.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.943
That way you can set up
everything the way you like.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.611
Ah. What do
you say, Carol?

02:57.645 --> 03:00.248
You, me, and a bird?
Ménage à turkey?

03:00.281 --> 03:01.782
Sure. Why not?

03:01.815 --> 03:04.252
America lost the war
on Christmas.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.587
Might as well surrender
Thanksgiving, too.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.722
This year the Millers
can celebrate on their own,

03:08.756 --> 03:11.925
like a bunch of Californians.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.888
Isn't this great?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.757
No family drama,
no stress.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.594
Just two thankful people
giving thanks

03:46.627 --> 03:48.396
and two quarts of heaven

03:48.429 --> 03:50.731
in a casserole dish.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.667
Aw, that is so sweet of you
to try.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.606
Too sweet, actually. We don't
traditionally do marshmallows

03:58.639 --> 04:00.741
in vegetables,
but it's no problem.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.876
I can fix it real easy.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.449
But don't feel bad about it.
I can make a new batch

04:08.482 --> 04:10.851
before you say,
"Thank you, Carol."

04:11.852 --> 04:13.887
I bet you can.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.558
Sorry about the yams.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.026
I just thought
maybe

04:19.059 --> 04:21.362
we could do one dish my way.

04:21.395 --> 04:22.763
But, uh...

04:22.796 --> 04:26.567
maybe I "yam" being a little
sensitive. (chuckles)

04:26.600 --> 04:29.837
Well, I appreciate the apology.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.505
But I just want this
to be as close

04:31.539 --> 04:33.841
to my normal Thanksgiving
as possible.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.509
(quietly): Something
you already made difficult

04:35.543 --> 04:37.811
by inviting
your favorite sushi waitress.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.784
(quietly):
I only asked her because you
said it was going to feel empty

04:43.817 --> 04:45.753
with just the two of us.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.688
Do you even know her name?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.690
No.

04:49.723 --> 04:53.727
But it doesn't matter
because she answers to anything.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.964
Hi, Penelope.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.899
Hello, Kip!

04:58.932 --> 05:01.469
Having a good time, Joanie?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.971
Oh, yes.
Thanks for having me, Kip.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.674
My pleasure, Paula.

05:06.707 --> 05:07.975
(chuckles)

05:11.111 --> 05:13.347
Oh, what-what are you doing?

05:13.381 --> 05:14.748
Just fixing your deviled eggs.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.817
You forgot
to put the olives on there.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.552
You're making them look
like eyeballs.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.821
Who wants their food staring
at them?

05:20.854 --> 05:22.823
That's the traditional way
of making them.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.558
The eyes of turkeys past.

05:24.592 --> 05:25.659
Mmm.
I'm sorry, but it

05:25.693 --> 05:28.095
just wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without the olives.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.963
Oh. Sure, yeah.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.999
I-I'm allergic.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.134
What?
Yeah,

05:34.167 --> 05:36.837
I'm allergic to olives.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.005
It's genetic.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.072
From my mom.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.141
Yeah, I got
her deadly olive allergy

05:41.174 --> 05:43.811
and her weakness
for state troopers.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.580
Allergic? Really?

05:46.614 --> 05:47.881
Mm-hmm.
I've never heard

05:47.915 --> 05:51.885
of anyone being allergic
to olives.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.822
Isn't that the great thing
about life?
Mm?

05:54.855 --> 05:57.157
We just never stop learning.
(chuckles)

05:57.190 --> 05:59.660
Yeah. So it's okay. I'll fix it.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.895
Because we don't want me
to die, now, do we, Jacklyn?

06:01.929 --> 06:03.130
No, Kip!

06:09.703 --> 06:12.440
(indistinct chatter)

06:12.473 --> 06:15.409
Are you sure this is
the Indian reservation

06:15.443 --> 06:16.577
your commune used to visit?

06:16.610 --> 06:17.445
Excuse me. Uh,

06:17.478 --> 06:18.612
I used to come here
every Thanksgiving

06:18.646 --> 06:21.148
as a child back when this used
to be an Indian reservation.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.016
Oh, it's still a reservation.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.486
But a few years ago
we decided to build a casino.

06:25.519 --> 06:28.021
We thought,
"If you can't beat 'em...

06:28.055 --> 06:31.191
Wait, we can beat 'em."
(chuckles)

06:31.224 --> 06:32.325
Well,

06:32.359 --> 06:33.527
as I was saying, my family
and I would like to offer you

06:33.561 --> 06:37.698
these gifts of used clothes,
canned goods, and $35 in change.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.767
Oh, that's really nice.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.635
But as you can see,

06:41.669 --> 06:44.171
we're good.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.976
What you got there?

06:49.009 --> 06:51.912
Uh, it's my old bean bag from
my frosh year back in college.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.113
Frosh year?

06:53.146 --> 06:55.983
Freshman. Sorry. Just trying
to loosen up the way I talk.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.951
Yeah. Hoping that old beanie

06:57.985 --> 07:01.021
might help Kate see me
from a new perspect'.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.823
When was the last time
you said,

07:02.856 --> 07:06.159
"Hey, look at that stressed-out
dude in the bean bag"?

07:06.193 --> 07:07.961
Speaking of beans, I'm starving.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.563
Please tell me
you bought some food.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.898
Sorry, Ray.

07:10.931 --> 07:15.035
The only dish
I'm serving up is non-tradish.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.169
You are not Matthew McConaughey.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.038
You will never be
Matthew McConaughey.

07:18.071 --> 07:21.108
So stop talking
like Matthew McConaughey!

07:21.141 --> 07:25.078
All right, all right, all right.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.749
Tom, I'm praying like a Pilgrim
that you brought some food.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.150
Sorry. When it comes
to family gatherings,

07:30.183 --> 07:32.620
I'm not usually expected
to do more

07:32.653 --> 07:35.489
than step out of the room
when I pass gas.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.127
Excuse me, will you?

07:42.062 --> 07:43.230
(doorbell rings)

07:43.263 --> 07:46.133
That's her. Okay.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.137
Come in! Or don't come in!

07:50.170 --> 07:52.105
Whatevs!

07:53.140 --> 07:55.776
Uh, Nathan. Hey.
Hey.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.110
What's up? You made it.
(chuckles)

07:57.144 --> 07:58.111
You know Ray.

07:58.145 --> 07:58.946
Hi.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.213
You know,
I'm surprised

08:00.247 --> 08:01.682
you called.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.083
You seem like the kind of guy

08:03.116 --> 08:04.885
who would be having
a traditional Thanksgiving

08:04.918 --> 08:06.286
with his family.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.155
Oh, is it Thanksgiving?

08:08.188 --> 08:10.991
That's why my drum circle
was canceled.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.594
Listen, I'm sorry
about the other night.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.128
I think I ate something
that made me a little bit,

08:15.162 --> 08:16.597
you know, uptight.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.065
What do you say
we go up to the roof later

08:18.098 --> 08:21.034
and become a member
of the 50-feet-high club?

08:21.068 --> 08:22.903
Wow. Okay.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.939
Be careful lighting the stove
in there.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.742
Tom?

08:28.776 --> 08:29.743
Kate!

08:29.777 --> 08:32.212
Oh, my gosh! So good to see you!

08:32.245 --> 08:34.147
(chuckling)

08:34.181 --> 08:35.949
You, uh... you know my father?

08:35.983 --> 08:38.686
Yeah. Oh, in fact, I still have
your umbrella in my car.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.953
I'll be right back.
Oh.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.022
(chuckling):
Okay.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.024
(mumbles)

08:44.057 --> 08:46.193
That's weird.
How do you two know each other?

08:46.226 --> 08:47.260
We used to date.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.101
I never thought
I'd say this, but, hey, bro,

08:54.134 --> 08:57.037
look at the stressed out guy
in the bean bag.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.114
What do you mean
you dated Kate?

09:07.147 --> 09:08.782
I met her while
I was chatting up the ladies

09:08.816 --> 09:10.050
at the senior center.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.952
She must have been visiting
someone.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.754
Oh, God,
this cannot be happening.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.690
Relax. We just had a
couple of fun evenings.

09:16.724 --> 09:19.226
It was fun, but after a while
I didn't call her anymore.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.629
She only liked the movies
with the subtitles.

09:21.662 --> 09:26.166
If I want to read, I'll
stay home and play Boggle.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.168
Look, Dad, just tell me when...

09:28.201 --> 09:29.703
when you went out with Kate,

09:29.737 --> 09:31.672
did you two ever m...

09:33.140 --> 09:35.876
Did-did you two ever m...

09:35.909 --> 09:37.110
No, I can't do it.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.279
It's like Fonzie trying
to say sorry.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.851
Nate, let me handle this.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.720
Thomas,
when you and Kate were dating,

09:46.754 --> 09:48.722
did you perchance
touch her boobies?

09:51.124 --> 09:53.093
A gentleman never tells.

09:54.194 --> 09:57.130
Okay. Here you go.
Oh.

09:57.164 --> 10:00.067
Thanks. And I'm
sorry I never called.
Oh,

10:00.100 --> 10:01.802
it's fine.
If we had kept hanging out,

10:01.835 --> 10:04.271
I never would have met
this guy.
Yeah.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.306
Yeah. Yeah.

10:08.008 --> 10:12.145
If we'd never met, none of this
would be happening right now.

10:12.179 --> 10:15.182
Can you imagine?
(chuckles)

10:17.217 --> 10:19.186
I've been trying to
give this change away,

10:19.219 --> 10:22.022
but I guess no one trusts
the white man anymore.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.024
Old wounds heal slow.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.226
That's the name of the first
woman I tried to give it to.

10:26.259 --> 10:29.362
Okay. Just give me the money,
all right?

10:29.396 --> 10:31.098
If you want the Native Americans
to have it,

10:31.131 --> 10:32.900
there's one surefire way
to do it.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.935
I'd like to put
this all on red.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.870
Whoa, whoa, whoa-- I don't think
that's such a good idea, honey.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.872
Oh, come on, you and I both
know we have the worst luck

10:38.906 --> 10:41.174
in the world.
I mean, you spent three days

10:41.208 --> 10:43.176
in a coma after a lucky
horseshoe fell

10:43.210 --> 10:44.144
and hit you on the head.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.179
I almost choked to death
on a rabbit's foot.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.380
There's no way we're gonna...

10:47.414 --> 10:49.149
Red wins.
We won?

10:49.182 --> 10:51.318
Oh! Oh, my God,
I can't believe it.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.120
Debbie, no,
this is terrible.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.288
Now we're actually taking money
away from them. Let me just...

10:55.322 --> 10:57.157
No, wait, wait, wait. Maybe
our luck has finally changed.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.091
W-What are you doing?

10:58.125 --> 11:00.060
The double streets
along with a quad bet

11:00.093 --> 11:01.762
and one straight up on 17.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.798
What? My sorority
did a lot of casino nights.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.100
Well, technically, I did
a lot of nights at the casino

11:07.134 --> 11:09.202
with my sorority's money.
Do not make me your treasurer.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.071
Okay, all right,

11:11.104 --> 11:14.241
luck be a tiny,
red-headed lady tonight. Yeah.

11:18.746 --> 11:22.049
How do you like my stuffing?
Mmm,

11:22.082 --> 11:25.285
delicious.
I must have the recipe.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.488
I'm happy to tell you
the recipe.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.424
Bread crumbs,
chicken stock, celery,

11:31.458 --> 11:34.027
and finely minced olives.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.836
You put olives in the stuffing?

11:42.870 --> 11:46.774
I put olives in everything!

11:46.807 --> 11:48.475
Everything!

11:48.508 --> 11:51.311
I knew you weren't allergic.
I was a teacher.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.781
I heard homework excuses
for over 30 years.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.348
I know a liar when I see one.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.351
And clearly you're just fine,
so I was right.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.321
You don't know
how allergies work.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.256
It takes a second
to get into the bloodstream.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.893
Yeah, it starts
in the stomach and it...

12:05.926 --> 12:07.460
works its way up
through the throat and...

12:07.494 --> 12:08.962
before you know it...

12:08.996 --> 12:11.364
(loud gasp)
Oh, my God.
Kip?

12:11.398 --> 12:14.434
Promise me you won't vote
for Blake Shelton's team.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.937
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

12:18.205 --> 12:21.108
Bye, Kip.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.010
Don't worry,
I always

12:23.043 --> 12:26.313
carry an EpiPen in case
Nathan develops allergies.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.948
I don't know where this goes,

12:27.981 --> 12:29.482
so I'm just gonna
start stabbing.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.952
No!

12:31.985 --> 12:33.520
Stop. God.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.122
All right, fine.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.357
I'm not allergic to olives.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.392
I knew it.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.795
I cannot believe that
my supposed best friend

12:41.829 --> 12:43.330
and roommate would
lie to me like this.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.866
It is so disrespectful!

12:45.899 --> 12:48.101
Disrespectful?

12:49.269 --> 12:52.139
Disre... How can... Me?

12:52.172 --> 12:56.109
Oh, my God.
Disrespectful?

12:56.143 --> 12:58.378
I'll tell you
what's disrespectful.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.247
When someone
works their cute little butt off

13:00.280 --> 13:02.983
to give you a great holiday
and all you do is complain

13:03.016 --> 13:04.918
and throw their yams
in the trash.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.386
I was doing us a favor.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.288
You were basically
serving us a tray

13:08.321 --> 13:10.557
full of melted circus peanuts.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.393
Oh. Oh, okay, all right.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.895
Well, since you
like dumping food

13:14.928 --> 13:17.297
and this is your Thanksgiving...

13:17.330 --> 13:20.133
How do you like this, huh?
You like that? Look at that.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.870
Oh, maybe you'll like this.
There go the yams.
Aah!

13:22.903 --> 13:25.973
All right, well, if you liked
that, you'll love this.

13:30.410 --> 13:34.381
Damn you, six months
of magician's academy.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.583
(growls)

13:36.616 --> 13:38.818
(grunting)

13:42.589 --> 13:44.224
If you were mad
at me all day,

13:44.257 --> 13:46.393
why the hell didn't you
just say something?

13:46.426 --> 13:48.328
Because I didn't want
to have a big fight.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.063
How's that going
for you?

13:50.097 --> 13:52.465
Bad!

13:54.334 --> 13:56.503
Are you ready for some football?

14:03.977 --> 14:05.979
(both laughing)

14:08.148 --> 14:10.283
There's no food in here.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.885
Look at her,

14:11.919 --> 14:13.921
she's totally fine
dating a father and son.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.956
Too bad Grandpa's not here.
She could hit the trifecta.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.157
Maybe you should stick to dating

14:17.190 --> 14:18.625
uptight girls.
No, look,

14:18.658 --> 14:20.994
I don't want to date those
types of women anymore.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.262
I want to date someone wild,

14:22.295 --> 14:25.332
and that's never gonna happen
if everybody thinks I'm a prude.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.401
I want people to
think I'm a freak.

14:28.435 --> 14:29.903
So if Kate's
okay with this,

14:29.937 --> 14:32.105
I need to find a way to
be okay with it, too.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.942
Hmm. Hey, Nate, listen.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.644
Whenever something's
bothering me, I pluck a hair

14:37.677 --> 14:39.646
and the pain
takes my mind off it.

14:39.679 --> 14:43.116
As you can see, I've had
some stressful years.

14:43.150 --> 14:46.253
Shouldn't we
be going to the roof?

14:46.286 --> 14:48.021
(clicks tongue)
Uh,

14:48.055 --> 14:50.023
yeah, I don't know.
It's kind of cold out

14:50.057 --> 14:51.458
tonight, don't you think?
Aah! Yes.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.162
Let's do it.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.468
Oh. Oh! Oh,
I won again.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.071
(laughs)
Oh, my God. Oh.

15:04.104 --> 15:07.074
Wesley Snipes was wrong-- you
don't always bet on black.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.942
(laughs)

15:08.976 --> 15:11.344
Also, you do
have to pay your taxes.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.246
All right, sweetie,
have you lost yet?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.614
Because Mikayla
wants to go...

15:14.647 --> 15:16.549
Is that all yours?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.719
Yeah, okay, honey, don't
be mad, but I'm up $1,000.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.256
$1,000? I'd have to lose
4,000 teeth to get that.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.691
Yeah, I know, I know.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.360
I'm sorry. I can't stop winning
and it feels so good.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.729
But if you still want
to give the money back...
Whoa, whoa, give it back?

15:29.762 --> 15:32.065
Are you crazy? No, listen,
it's one thing being generous

15:32.099 --> 15:33.733
when you're poor, because you
have, like, nothing to give.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.702
But this is real money, Debbie.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.537
We're thousandaires.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.439
Yeah, I know.
And why stop there?

15:39.472 --> 15:42.109
I mean, if we keep this streak
going, you could buy a boat.

15:42.142 --> 15:45.278
I could buy the kind of boobs
that belong on a boat.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.981
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Debbie,
we can't win forever, okay?

15:48.015 --> 15:49.116
If history has
taught us anything,

15:49.149 --> 15:50.483
it's that our luck
will run out.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.219
So what if we
just walk away,

15:52.252 --> 15:54.287
for the first time in our
lives, as winners, right?

15:54.321 --> 15:56.556
We just take our winnings
off the table and go home.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.758
You're right. Okay.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.027
A-All bets
are final.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.528
The ball's working.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.197
The ball is working.

16:04.231 --> 16:07.034
That's what the nurse said
after my tractor accident.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.676
Oh, look, it's already dark.
(giggles)

16:16.709 --> 16:18.211
We're not supposed
to be up here.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.213
Look at me,
breaking rules.

16:20.247 --> 16:23.116
Wish I had something
to litter.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.219
I had some other
activities in mind.
Oh. (chuckles)

16:30.623 --> 16:32.059
(grunts)

16:32.092 --> 16:34.227
Did you just pull a hair out?

16:34.261 --> 16:36.796
Uh, well...
Oh,

16:36.829 --> 16:39.232
I see someone likes a little
pain with their pleasure.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.168
Well... No, no, no, I don't.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.702
Yeah? Yeah?
Oh, ow!

16:42.735 --> 16:44.304
You like that?
Ow. No, no, no, stop, stop.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.074
No, I don't like
pain. Ow, gosh.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.508
No, I was just...

16:48.541 --> 16:50.643
I was pulling my hair out so I
wouldn't have to think about

16:50.677 --> 16:53.613
you hooking up with my
dad, but... it's okay,

16:53.646 --> 16:56.083
I-I can do this. Let...
I-I'll get over it.
Wait,

16:56.116 --> 16:59.252
wait-- I never
hooked up with your dad.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.254
It was volunteer work.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.623
A lot of the seniors at
the center would invite me out

17:03.656 --> 17:06.293
to dinner or a movie. Your dad
looked lonely, so I said yes.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.228
Oh, my God.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.130
My dad thought it was a date.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.431
Ew.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.166
Oh, I know.
Oh.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.268
Oh, my God, I know,
it's ... What a relief.

17:15.302 --> 17:19.106
I mean, just thinking about
how far you guys got-- I mean...

17:19.139 --> 17:21.208
Did he fondle your breasts?
(chuckles)

17:21.241 --> 17:23.743
Did you fondle his breasts?

17:23.776 --> 17:25.278
Anyway, where were we?

17:25.312 --> 17:26.379
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.780
So you-you brought me up here

17:27.814 --> 17:30.217
and you were actually
considering having sex with me

17:30.250 --> 17:32.119
when you thought I'd
been with your dad?

17:32.152 --> 17:34.187
Yeah. Yeah,
I guess I was.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.856
Pretty... Pretty wild, huh?

17:36.889 --> 17:39.292
It's pretty weird.

17:39.326 --> 17:40.793
It's really weird.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.230
God, I'm sorry, Nate, but
that's too out there,

17:43.263 --> 17:45.465
even for me.

17:45.498 --> 17:48.168
You're kind of a freak.

17:50.837 --> 17:54.474
Yeah, guess I am a freak.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.809
If you know any girls who are
looking for a wild time,

17:56.843 --> 17:59.179
let 'em know
there's a new bad boy in town

17:59.212 --> 18:01.214
and he doesn't
play by the rules.

18:01.248 --> 18:04.617
(thumping)
MAN: We're trying to have
Thanksgiving dinner down here.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.320
I don't care. I'm a bad boy.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.824
And if you've got a problem
with it, I'm Kip Finkle in 1-A.

18:21.801 --> 18:25.405
Sorry for throwing
all your food on the floor.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.840
Even though the way I did it

18:27.874 --> 18:29.742
was dazzling.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.516
And I'm sorry for risking
your life to prove a point.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.218
I swore I wouldn't
do that again

18:38.251 --> 18:40.420
after I held Tom
over that bridge.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.892
So you're just holding all that
stuff in to avoid a fight?

18:45.925 --> 18:49.196
We've just never fought before,
and it's been so great.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.198
I just thought
I'd bite my tongue,

18:51.231 --> 18:53.466
swallow my emotions,
and sit on my feelings,

18:53.500 --> 18:55.468
and we'd keep it up.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.704
Sounds like a lot of work.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.940
Fights are easier.
You get it out and it's done.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.409
I guess you're right.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.744
It's just... We never
did that in my family.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.813
You're part of this family now.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.815
So we're gonna
fight some.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.417
Especially on the holidays.

19:10.450 --> 19:13.220
You might even
win some.

19:13.253 --> 19:16.223
Not with me, but...

19:16.256 --> 19:17.390
maybe Debbie.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.559
(laughs)

19:22.395 --> 19:24.364
Well, our footloose and

19:24.397 --> 19:25.898
fancy-free Thanksgiving
was a bust.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.367
Please tell me
there's some food left.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.968
Oh, we've got some.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.204
It's all in here, though.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.210
How long's it been in there?

19:37.244 --> 19:39.412
Well, hope you guys
are hungry.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.813
We got a Thanksgiving feast

19:40.847 --> 19:43.850
courtesy of the casino.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.686
They gave us vouchers to the
casino's Thanksgiving buffet

19:46.719 --> 19:49.489
because Mom and Dad
lost so much money.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.392
Guess it's back to collecting
kids' teeth at school.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.296
Let's grab some chairs.

19:56.329 --> 19:59.799
Oh, look at all this food.
It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

19:59.832 --> 20:03.336
Are you gonna tell your dad
the truth about Kate?

20:03.370 --> 20:04.871
Nah.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.574
It's like when I was cut
from my junior high soccer team.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.442
My Dad protected
my feelings by telling me

20:09.476 --> 20:10.577
it was 'cause
I was too fast.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.979
(chuckles) It wasn't because
you were too fast, was it?

20:13.012 --> 20:15.982
No, my mom
told me the truth.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.918
I was too good-looking.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.587
Who stole my spoon?
I need a spoon

20:20.620 --> 20:22.455
to get the marshmallows
out of my yams.

20:22.489 --> 20:23.956
Dad, it's under
your napkin.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.459
Why don't you open your eyes
once before you open your mouth?

20:26.493 --> 20:27.427
Hey, you watch yourself.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.629
You plan on leaving some
for the rest of us?

20:29.662 --> 20:31.331
I'm still growing.
I've been up for 18 hours.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.065
Can I just have
a darn green bean?
Okay,

20:33.099 --> 20:35.568
just say "please" next time.
You're gonna have to have more
than green beans, young lady.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.737
I'll give you all
the green beans you want.
You're gonna have to have

20:37.770 --> 20:39.739
some of that turkey.
NATHAN: Yeah, well, why don't
you send it to your plate...

20:39.772 --> 20:42.041
TOM: Put a napkin
around it, Kip.
DEBBIE: Where is the gravy?

20:42.074 --> 20:45.378
You like this, don't you?
(all clamoring)

20:45.412 --> 20:46.713
I love it.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.015
TOM: I gave that
turkey leg...

20:49.048 --> 20:51.050
Okay, all right.
Come on.

20:51.083 --> 21:05.932
What's so hard about that?
There's two of these
and one of those.
