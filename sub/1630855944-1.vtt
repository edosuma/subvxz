[Aya] There's a first time
for lots of things in one's life.

00:25.541 --> 00:27.833
The first time you fall in love.

00:28.875 --> 00:31.708
The first time you meet your in-laws.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.375
The first time you…

00:34.458 --> 00:35.958
Uh… [chuckles]

00:36.041 --> 00:38.375
Okay, you all know what I'm talking about.

00:39.250 --> 00:40.250
Ah!

00:40.875 --> 00:44.083
Becoming a parent for the very first time.

00:45.208 --> 00:46.583
What a blessing!

00:47.583 --> 00:51.750
Especially when you are living
in a paradise called Mauritius.

00:52.333 --> 00:53.875
They say it's all happiness.

00:54.458 --> 00:55.916
But why I must lie?

00:56.541 --> 00:58.833
It can get on your nerves too.

00:58.916 --> 01:00.250
But wait.

01:00.875 --> 01:03.541
You all think I'm talking about the baby?

01:16.833 --> 01:18.250
What more can I ask for?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.625
Yes, my daughter's having a baby.

01:24.708 --> 01:26.000
[giggles] Hey.

01:27.333 --> 01:29.250
Can you believe it's only three more days?

01:29.333 --> 01:32.458
-I can't wait to get onto that plane.
-Mauritius, here we come!

01:32.541 --> 01:34.250
It's a girl, guaranteed.

01:34.333 --> 01:37.250
I'm 100% certain it's gonna be a boy.

01:38.041 --> 01:39.791
Thank you. Thank you.

01:39.875 --> 01:42.583
[Aya] I'm talking about the grandparents.

When they come into the picture,
it's like one roller-coaster ride.

-Well, I'm praying for Jodi's looks.
-Prishen's brains.

01:50.875 --> 01:53.000
-She's such a beauty queen.
-He's a doctor.

There is no doubt
the Kandasamy genes will win, hands down.

We don't have any option.

So much for happy thoughts.

I just can't wait to see my Prishen.

But the best part is my granddaughter
is gonna be sleeping with me.

03:08.916 --> 03:12.625
Uh-uh. I've already ordered a cot
for my grandson.

03:18.958 --> 03:21.291
We just need to steer them
in the right direction.

03:21.375 --> 03:24.458
Once they've had the baby, it's done.
Then they can just focus--

I have a better idea.

I want Prishen's room." Just stop it.

can I at least get Prishen's room?

Okay, okay, man.

11:11.375 --> 11:12.958
[chuckles] There you go.

11:13.458 --> 11:16.375
[Shanthi] Jen, he's not messaging.
He's not calling or anything.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.583
It's very unlike him. Please try Jodi.

11:18.666 --> 11:20.500
Jodi? No, no, no, no, no! No Jodi.

[chattering indistinctly]

13:04.916 --> 13:06.125
Look at our baby.

13:06.750 --> 13:10.166
Aw! Look at my granddaughter.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.250
I feel like I've just won the jackpot.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.250
Isn't, Jen?

13:14.333 --> 13:19.375
And, Jodi, that nightie is just too cute.
Perfect choice.

13:19.458 --> 13:20.625
[whispering] It's just ugly.

13:20.708 --> 13:22.375
Too lovely dress.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.083
It's ugly.

13:24.166 --> 13:25.875
You okay, sweetheart? Hmm?

13:25.958 --> 13:27.250
[zipper unzipping]

13:27.333 --> 13:30.541
-Oh my God! Look at her.
-[Shanthi] Look at her.

13:30.625 --> 13:32.625
[Jennifer gasps] How gorgeous!

13:32.708 --> 13:37.458
And just now, I'll have a grandson,
and we'll have the perfect pigeon pair.

13:37.541 --> 13:39.916
-Uh-uh, Shanthi, what is wrong with you?
-What?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.166
My child has literally just given birth.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.250
-Please!
-[Shanthi] Yeah! Nice like that.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.625
Then they can grow up together.
Isn't it, momos?

13:46.708 --> 13:48.916
-Just… Okay.
-Prishen. Prishen.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.208
-[Shanthi clicking tongue]
-Um…

13:51.291 --> 13:53.833
-Jodi needs to get some rest.
-Of course darling. Of course.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.541
-I can't wait to see their house.
-Me too. Absolutely.

13:56.625 --> 13:59.125
Actually, you're not staying with us.

13:59.208 --> 14:00.291
[man singing taal]

14:00.375 --> 14:01.666

-What?

[taal continues with upbeat music]

14:15.291 --> 14:16.250
[music ends]

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Merci beaucoup.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.916
Uh, Ma, Aunty Jen, have something.

14:32.750 --> 14:35.791
Uh, son, this resort looks expensive. Eh?

14:39.166 --> 14:41.166
[Preggie slurping noisily]

14:47.416 --> 14:50.083
-This is not a holiday, huh?
-Absolutely.

14:50.166 --> 14:53.625
We're here to maintain
a calm and peaceful atmosphere.

14:53.708 --> 14:55.208
[Preggie] At all times.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.291
[Aya] Yeah, Prishen, we thought
we're gonna sleep lakeside by your house.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.041
Isn't, Jennifer? Isn't, Shanthi?

15:01.625 --> 15:03.500
Just, you know, relax and enjoy.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.750
We're not here for enjoyment, my boy.

15:05.833 --> 15:07.958
It takes a village, son.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.958
And we are the village.
We have the day planned day by day.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.625
Moothoo will be with you all full-time,
and everything's been booked and paid for.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.375
What more can we ask for, son?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.041
-[Prishen] Oh.
-[papers rustling]

15:19.125 --> 15:21.583
[Prishen] I've got these itineraries
for each day.

15:23.541 --> 15:24.375
Aunty Jen.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.875
[Aya] The way Jennifer also likes to plan.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.125
So nice, Prishen.

15:30.666 --> 15:33.958
Day one, day two, day three.

15:34.041 --> 15:36.166
So organized!

15:37.333 --> 15:39.541
Meeting adjourned.

15:42.166 --> 15:44.166
-What the hell just happened?
-What do you mean?

15:44.250 --> 15:46.708
-Did we come here for fun?
-Why are you getting so worked up?

15:47.291 --> 15:49.750
-Looks like a tough group.
-Nah, let me guide you.

15:49.833 --> 15:52.041
There's Shanthi, crybaby.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.000
Are these children off their bloody heads?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.833
A few screws loose here and there.

15:55.916 --> 15:58.666
Our first grandchild is here,
and they expect us to go sightseeing.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.166
Then there's her husband, Preggie.
A bit slow.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.666
Come on, this holiday
must have cost Prishen a packet.

16:04.750 --> 16:07.000
-Big cheapskate too.
-We can't waste his money.

16:07.083 --> 16:09.750
Money, money, money.
That's Jennifer for you.

16:09.833 --> 16:11.583
She can be a real pain in the…

16:11.666 --> 16:14.666
Ass. Total ass! That's what he is.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.833
Big boss. Short fuse, very cranky.

16:17.916 --> 16:19.416
Since when is Prishen our boss?

16:19.500 --> 16:21.708
Well, I think
what the kids did is quite thoughtful.

16:21.791 --> 16:24.916
Ah, my Elvis. Cool as one cucumber.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.375
Can you calm down?
You're acting like a crazy woman.

16:27.458 --> 16:29.875
Don't tell me to calm down, Preggie.
Are you mad or what?

16:29.958 --> 16:32.791
What do Jodi and Prishen know
about bringing up a child? Hmm?

16:32.875 --> 16:34.708
What did we do to deserve this?

16:34.791 --> 16:36.250
To deserve a fully paid holiday?

16:36.333 --> 16:39.583
They know nothing, Elvis.
N-O-T-H-I-N-G. Nothing.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.708
You don't have to S-P-E-L-L it out for me.

16:41.791 --> 16:44.916
Oh, just shut up! Can't you see
they're trying to shut us out?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.041
Jen, this is a life-changing moment
for them.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.666
This is a life-changing moment
for me, Preggie.

16:49.750 --> 16:52.208
-Plus, you got the new Brazilian--
-[Shanthi] Absolutely not.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.750
[both] I'm a grandmother now.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.583
How are you feeling, Grandma?

17:06.791 --> 17:08.500
How're you feeling, Aya?

17:09.916 --> 17:12.750
[sighs] I just wish
we could hold our baby.

17:14.708 --> 17:16.333
You think we should call Jodi?

17:17.583 --> 17:18.958
We could.

17:19.708 --> 17:21.958
[spluttering] Only to see how she is.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.166
Okay.

17:24.375 --> 17:25.791
[line ringing]

17:25.875 --> 17:27.791
[woman in French]
Jodi's phone. Hello. Who's this?

17:27.875 --> 17:31.458
[in English] It's a nurse.
Um, this is Jodi's mom. Is Jodi there?

17:32.083 --> 17:34.000
Oh, Aunty Jen. It's Anjali here.

17:34.583 --> 17:35.541
Anjali?

17:36.041 --> 17:38.000
-Uh, Anjali…
-[whispering indistinctly]

17:39.041 --> 17:40.000
[speakerphone beeps]

17:40.083 --> 17:42.208
[Jennifer]
Are you at the hospital with Jodi?

17:42.291 --> 17:45.458
[Anjali] No, no. They've just come home.
I'm here to help.

17:45.541 --> 17:46.541
Ask them what time.

17:46.625 --> 17:49.083
Shh. Um, um, Anjali…

17:49.166 --> 17:51.916
-[whispering indistinctly]
-Is it possible for me to speak to Jodi?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.958
[Anjali] Not right now. Allez, bye.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.000
[splutters]

17:58.583 --> 18:01.208
-She cut the call?
-She cut the call.

18:01.291 --> 18:02.625
The audacity!

18:02.708 --> 18:05.583
-They didn't even do the prayers, Jen!
-Yeah, but forget about all that.

18:05.666 --> 18:08.708
This self-appointed spokesperson,
Anjali… whatever.

18:08.791 --> 18:10.083
Who are the mothers here?

18:10.166 --> 18:12.958
-This nonsense has to stop right now.
-Hmm.

[Indian classical music playing]

18:16.416 --> 18:18.458
[Elvis] I hope you guys
checked your schedules.

18:18.541 --> 18:20.791
[Aya] Which one? Jennifer's or Prishen's?

18:20.875 --> 18:23.250
[Jennifer] Ugh!
That boy is absolutely clueless.

18:23.333 --> 18:26.083
He has us covering
every damn corner of this island.

18:26.166 --> 18:28.166
-Hey, I love it.
-Yeah, me too.

18:28.250 --> 18:33.791
Today, you, me, cigars,
one, two whiskeys on the Seven Sands.

18:33.875 --> 18:36.541
-That's what I came here for.
-That's what you came for?

-[phone ringing]
-You and Elvis…

18:44.416 --> 18:45.583
Yeah, I'm fine too.

18:48.458 --> 18:51.125
Desan, are you eating properly?

18:51.208 --> 18:53.125
-Why do you look like that?
-Nothing, Ma.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.875
-[Shanthi] You okay?
-Nothing happened.

18:54.958 --> 18:56.916
Desan, what I said about lies?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.500
Some boys were just playing rough,
and I got hurt.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.458
Wait. Somebody is bullying you?

19:04.583 --> 19:06.583
Elvis, you want the dhal puri?

[party horn blowing shrilly]

19:08.666 --> 19:12.208
Okay, okay, Ma, please stop that.
That's really annoying.

19:12.833 --> 19:14.291
Like some people I know.

19:15.041 --> 19:17.416
[party horn blowing shrilly]

19:18.333 --> 19:19.458
-What did I say?
-[Elvis] Jen.

19:20.375 --> 19:24.375
Guys. Preggie, look here.
See what these monsters did to our baby.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.916
[tuts] Don't worry, doll.
It's a small injury.

19:30.791 --> 19:33.166
Shanthi, that's like a scratch, man.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.375
Don't worry, Shanthi. He'll be fine.

19:35.916 --> 19:39.333
Considering Desan's size,
they took quite a chance with him.

19:39.416 --> 19:41.583
Aya, size doesn't matter.

19:41.666 --> 19:43.791
Oh, that's what you think.

19:52.666 --> 19:54.291
Checking to see if she's breathing, babe?

19:54.375 --> 19:56.541
Hmm. I'm just trying to breast-pump again.

19:57.416 --> 20:01.583
Ooh. Um, should I maybe call the moms
for some extra backup?

20:02.541 --> 20:03.458
-Pew.
-[laughs]

20:04.250 --> 20:06.250
Bru, check these photos
of the Seven Sands.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.291
It's one of the seven wonders
of Mauritius.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.041
-Now we have the eighth.
-Ah.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.333
This man here has been dreaming
about the Seven Sands

20:12.416 --> 20:13.708
for I don't know how long.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.750
Me too. What a dream I had!

20:16.833 --> 20:18.750
Jennifer got swallowed by the Seven Sands.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.583
[inhales] Um, shall we go?

20:22.250 --> 20:23.458
Moothoo.

20:26.875 --> 20:27.791
Listen.

20:28.750 --> 20:29.833
Change of plan.

20:30.416 --> 20:33.500
No, madame, we'll miss the Seven Sands.
It is one of the--

20:33.583 --> 20:36.958
Seven wonders of Mauritius.
I get that. I heard you,

20:37.041 --> 20:38.625
and I honestly don't care.

20:39.208 --> 20:41.583
Madame, Mr. Preggie wants so badly
to see the Seven--

20:41.666 --> 20:44.000
Okay, Moothoo,
just listen to me carefully.

20:44.083 --> 20:48.750
Firstly, Mr. Preggie is an idiot
who needs seven claps.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.416
And secondly, I will pay you.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.208
In dollars.

20:54.291 --> 20:55.708
[comical music playing]

20:56.375 --> 20:58.583
You mean like a service fee?

20:59.666 --> 21:01.791
Exactly that. A tip.

21:04.416 --> 21:07.916
Madame, just write your name on it
and put it in the cubby.

21:09.583 --> 21:10.541
Drese patout.

21:12.291 --> 21:13.375
What does that mean?

21:13.458 --> 21:14.416
"Drese patout"?

21:14.500 --> 21:17.625
It means "everything is good."

21:18.500 --> 21:20.625
It is indeed.

[Indian classical music playing]

21:23.625 --> 21:25.958
[Elvis] Moothoo, is this the way
to the Seven Sands?

21:26.041 --> 21:29.250
[Jennifer] I'm sure the driver knows
which route to take, Elvis.

21:30.708 --> 21:32.458
[Elvis] I think you missed a turn.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.791
[Shanthi] We're here.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.833
Where's our baby?

21:36.916 --> 21:39.208
-[Elvis] How'd this happen?
-[Preggie] You're asking me?

21:39.291 --> 21:41.916
I didn't sleep last night.
I was so excited about the Seven Sands.

21:42.000 --> 21:42.875
Hi.

21:43.541 --> 21:44.625
[Anjali] Oh, everyone.

21:45.625 --> 21:47.333
What a surprise!

21:48.000 --> 21:49.416
Welcome, everybody.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.750
And you are?

21:50.833 --> 21:52.500
Anjali. I live next door.

21:52.583 --> 21:56.833
What a lovely young lady!
Like a godmother for the baby.

21:56.916 --> 21:57.791
[Anjali chuckles]

21:58.375 --> 22:02.208
I'll take her. Who needs a godmother
when we have two grandmothers here?

22:02.291 --> 22:06.333
Oh, look at her. This is right
where she belongs, with her grandmother.

22:06.416 --> 22:10.375
I can't believe that you brought the baby
into the house without doing any prayers.

22:10.458 --> 22:11.416
Who does she look like?

22:11.500 --> 22:13.666
[Aya] Definitely not Shanthi and Jennifer.

22:13.750 --> 22:17.833
More like a mini-Elvis. Lucky fish.

22:17.916 --> 22:19.583
Would you all like some chai?

22:19.666 --> 22:21.125
Would you?

22:21.208 --> 22:22.708
You are the guest after all.

22:22.791 --> 22:25.208
-Elvis and I would like some.
-[Anjali] Sure.

22:29.333 --> 22:31.708
What is wrong with you?
You're suffocating all of us.

22:31.791 --> 22:35.041
What is wrong with you?
You want bad wind to catch the baby?

22:35.125 --> 22:37.208
That bad wind caught my son long ago.

22:37.291 --> 22:38.541

[Shanthi] Yeah, just…

22:47.791 --> 22:51.291

23:21.708 --> 23:24.125
-I always tell you homemade is best.
-Definitely.

23:24.208 --> 23:26.458
[in Mauritian Creole]
Your mother is a witch! Hurricane!

23:26.541 --> 23:28.458
Yours is a devil. Volcano!

23:28.541 --> 23:30.125
-Oui, oui!
-[both laugh]

23:30.208 --> 23:32.791
[in English] Hey! That sounds so nice.
What are you saying?

23:32.875 --> 23:36.541
It means that it's such a blessing
to have you guys here.

23:36.625 --> 23:37.625
Aw.

23:38.541 --> 23:39.583
[Jennifer chuckles]

23:39.666 --> 23:40.666
[breathing deeply]

23:42.625 --> 23:43.708
[rattling]

23:46.583 --> 23:48.625
[Shanthi] Jodi, so quickly
you're giving the bottle.

23:48.708 --> 23:51.375
Breast is best
if you want a healthy child.

23:51.458 --> 23:53.708
[sighs] I'm… I'm trying.
I'm trying so hard.

23:53.791 --> 23:54.833
Try a bit harder.

23:54.916 --> 23:58.541
Eat all the right things
and put garlic in everything.

23:58.625 --> 23:59.833
Don't give up so easily.

23:59.916 --> 24:02.500
-Leave her, man.
-[Shanthi] What "leave her, man"?

24:02.583 --> 24:04.916
Everything is dry.
She's not even squirting.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.333
[muffled] What's squirting?

24:06.416 --> 24:08.625
[Jennifer] Stop pressurizing Jodi.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.750
You know, I bottle-fed you,
and look at how well you turned out.

24:11.833 --> 24:13.750
[Shanthi] And look at Prishen. Hmm?

24:13.833 --> 24:16.666
I breastfed him
till the time he was five years old.

24:16.750 --> 24:17.958
-[laughs awkwardly]
-What?

24:18.041 --> 24:21.250
Jodi clearly does not want to breastfeed.

24:21.333 --> 24:23.583
Oh, actually, Ma, I want to do both.

24:24.166 --> 24:25.875
-See?
-No, you don't.

24:25.958 --> 24:29.375
Jodi, do what works for you.
Baby and you will find your own rhythm.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.416
Oh. Are you a nurse, Anjali?

24:32.458 --> 24:34.250
I'll be monitoring you, Jodi.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.583
[Shanthi] So, Jodi, exactly, um,

24:38.250 --> 24:42.208
how much breast and how much bottle
are you giving? Say 50/50?

24:46.666 --> 24:47.875
She felt ambushed.

24:47.958 --> 24:50.208
[Preggie] Son, we also felt ambushed.

24:50.291 --> 24:51.791
The weather messed us up.

24:51.875 --> 24:53.458
They just bulldoze their way in.

24:53.541 --> 24:56.166
I was looking and looking by the window
for the Seven Sands.

24:56.250 --> 24:58.000
Dad, this can't happen again.

24:58.083 --> 24:59.250
Just leave it to us.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.500
Hey, what's my mother
and Moothoo up to there?

25:04.291 --> 25:07.250
[Preggie] Looking really cozy
if you ask me.

25:08.083 --> 25:10.791
Dad, Uncle Elvis,
I can count on you guys, right?

25:10.875 --> 25:13.333
-I said we'll sort it out, all right?
-[Prishen sighs]

25:13.416 --> 25:16.250
Hey, hey, now they're kissing.

25:16.875 --> 25:18.125
Check there. Check there.

25:20.000 --> 25:20.833
[Elvis] Hey.

25:22.083 --> 25:25.166
Hey, you don't think
Moothoo and my mother are…

25:25.708 --> 25:27.333
[both] Nah!

25:27.416 --> 25:28.416
Seriously?

25:30.958 --> 25:31.958
[Prishen sighs]

25:33.041 --> 25:35.708
Firstly, it's this Desan school problem.

25:35.791 --> 25:38.500
Then I didn't pin this pocketknife
on the baby.

25:38.583 --> 25:40.666
[muffled] Oh, that's bad luck, man.

25:40.750 --> 25:43.541
Yeah. Eish! I'm getting it from all sides.

25:43.625 --> 25:47.500
That baby needs this knife.
Plus, too, it's our custom.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.750
-[sighs]
-Who will take us?

25:50.833 --> 25:51.833
I don't know.

25:55.458 --> 25:56.333
Moothoo?

[upbeat percussion music playing]

26:41.583 --> 26:42.875
[inaudible]

26:56.583 --> 26:58.416
What a stupid name, Anjali.

26:58.500 --> 27:01.583
And to think
she's got more baby time than us, Jen.

27:01.666 --> 27:02.500
I know.

27:02.583 --> 27:05.666
-"Can I make you all some chai?"
-[Jen sighs disgustedly]

27:05.750 --> 27:09.333
You know, I felt something was off
with her from the beginning.

27:09.416 --> 27:10.791
-You also felt it?
-Mm-hmm.

27:10.875 --> 27:12.166
I thought it was just me.

27:15.416 --> 27:16.250
[phone beeps]

27:16.750 --> 27:18.000
Hi, Rani.

27:18.083 --> 27:21.541
Oh, yeah, it's… it's a bit loud here.
Yeah, what's that?

27:25.250 --> 27:26.166
Wait, what?

27:27.458 --> 27:28.375
No, it can't be.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.041
Never.

27:33.125 --> 27:33.958
[sighs]

27:35.125 --> 27:37.166
[sighs] Saw my moves?

27:37.250 --> 27:39.958
Aya on the dance floor. [laughs]

27:40.041 --> 27:41.125
[Shanthi] Preggs.

27:41.875 --> 27:44.333
They're now saying
that Desan wasn't bullied.

27:44.416 --> 27:47.333
They're saying that Desan is the bully.

27:47.416 --> 27:48.625
[Aya] Same thing I'm saying.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.750
Who's gonna tackle him with his size?
Hefty fella like that.

27:51.833 --> 27:55.000
You know what?
I think somebody's framing Desan.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.583
Our poor baby.

27:56.666 --> 27:58.833
Shanthi, he's not a baby anymore.

27:58.916 --> 28:01.958
Yeah, but he's not Prishen.
He needs guidance.

28:04.000 --> 28:04.875
[Jennifer] Elvis.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.083
Elvis.

28:09.083 --> 28:10.000
Elvis?

28:14.041 --> 28:16.000
Desan, listen to me, huh?

28:16.541 --> 28:19.291
You got to tell me exactly what happened.

28:19.375 --> 28:21.833
Right. Because there's a lot of stories
going on about you.

28:21.916 --> 28:24.791
-Ma, I'm so scared.
-You can't be scared now, Desan.

28:24.875 --> 28:26.958
I don't know what to do,
and you're not here.

28:27.041 --> 28:30.708
You need to be brave,
and you need to behave like your brother.

28:30.791 --> 28:33.500
Now this is what you're going to do.
Listen carefully.

[music continues]

28:40.750 --> 28:42.250
[music fades out]

28:49.166 --> 28:51.375

[chuckles]

28:56.250 --> 28:58.500
[comical music playing]

29:04.000 --> 29:05.416
Stop that.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.750
Not a single word.

29:12.833 --> 29:15.166
Okay, Miss Confidence. You bet, you lost.

29:15.250 --> 29:20.291
But, um, let's look on the bright side.
We both look like twins. [chuckling]

29:20.375 --> 29:21.250
-Listen…
-Yeah?

29:21.333 --> 29:23.708
Let's just eat and go. And no pictures.

29:25.875 --> 29:27.625
-Really, Shanthi?
-What?

29:28.500 --> 29:29.416
No.

29:29.500 --> 29:30.875
-What happened?
-You can't…

29:30.958 --> 29:32.916
-Wait… No!
-[gasping]

29:33.000 --> 29:35.458

-You think Jodi cooked for us?

Shanthi…

29:37.375 --> 29:39.583
-What's this here?
-[chef] Guacamole.

29:40.916 --> 29:43.416
-"Cockamole"?
-No, "guacamole."

29:45.458 --> 29:47.166
[Aya] Oh, "cockamole."

29:47.708 --> 29:48.916
Hey, get out you, man.

29:50.083 --> 29:51.125
You do takeaways?

29:57.375 --> 29:58.208
Hey.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.416
We promised Prishen, huh?

30:00.500 --> 30:02.333
No, no, no, today we bring our A-game.

30:02.416 --> 30:05.583
-[chuckles] Let the games begin.

[upbeat percussion music playing]

30:18.875 --> 30:19.875
[music ends]

30:21.208 --> 30:22.625
Moothoo is a tough negotiator.

30:22.708 --> 30:25.208
-I don't know what's gotten into him.
-He took the money.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.458
-How much?
-Double what I thought.

30:27.541 --> 30:28.916
-Shanthi, are you stupid?
-What?

30:29.000 --> 30:32.625
Would we be here all the way in Mauritius
playing this laser tag of all things?

30:32.708 --> 30:35.000
But it's fine.
At least we're here. That's good.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.375
Are you ready?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.458
Yeah, let's do this thing.

30:38.541 --> 30:41.041
-We gotta pick teams. I choose Shanthi.
-Yeah.

30:41.125 --> 30:43.541
That's not fair.
She's like a human shield.

30:43.625 --> 30:44.708
[Shanthi sighs]

30:44.791 --> 30:48.041
Fine. It's Preggie and I.
A battle of the sexes.

[gun blasting]

30:49.041 --> 30:50.791
Hey. Hey, what about me then?

30:50.875 --> 30:52.583
You're useless on any team anyway.

30:52.666 --> 30:55.375
Like you're useless
in the kitchen, bedroom, everywhere.

30:55.458 --> 30:57.083
-Ma!
-What I said?

30:57.166 --> 30:59.666
She can't clean kitchen, bedroom.
Nothing she can do.

30:59.750 --> 31:01.208
Just join the guys' team.

31:01.291 --> 31:03.833
You're gonna need
the extra protection anyway.

31:03.916 --> 31:04.916
[under breath] Witch.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.375
What's our strategy, sir?

31:06.458 --> 31:07.291
Calm down.

31:07.375 --> 31:10.250
I'm taking the old lady.
Human shield, my foot.

31:10.333 --> 31:13.750
We just need to kill time.
So make it long and painful.

31:13.833 --> 31:15.458
Think of that damn Anjali.

31:15.958 --> 31:18.708
Come on, Jen. Let's finish these ones off.

31:18.791 --> 31:20.250
Ten-four that, sir!

31:20.333 --> 31:21.208
Let's go.

All's fair in love and war.

32:00.916 --> 32:02.250
We're on the same team, Ma.

Moothoo's just refusing any offer.

Keeps saying, "Madame, today is a day
of leisure for your pleasure."

32:34.875 --> 32:37.250
But I thought you got him
where you want him.

32:37.333 --> 32:39.500
I got Moothoo where I want him, brah.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.541

three more hours.

Everybody, can I have your attention?

33:14.083 --> 33:18.250
I just wanna say a few words
because my heart is so full of joy today.

33:19.291 --> 33:21.333
Jodi and Prishen, come and stand by me.

33:22.875 --> 33:26.208
The birth of a baby is a new season
and a new time.

33:26.291 --> 33:32.250
Today I'm happy to announce
I am the laser tag queen of Mauritius.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.250

-I even have a certificate.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.041
Take that, suckers.

33:36.125 --> 33:38.958
[Prishen and Jodi laugh]
Congratulations, Aya.

33:39.041 --> 33:41.000
-You think that was the highlight?
-Anjali.

33:41.583 --> 33:43.000
What time did you get here?

33:43.083 --> 33:47.166
She's a neighbor. She can go in
and come anytime she pleases.

33:47.250 --> 33:49.375
Oh. We were told 2:00 p.m.

33:49.458 --> 33:52.833
I just popped in to share this app
with Jodi. It works like a charm.

33:52.916 --> 33:55.458
Apps are good,
but nothing beats a mother's touch.

33:55.541 --> 33:56.500
Exactly.

33:56.583 --> 33:59.416
Besides, I've already drawn up a routine
for my daughter.

33:59.916 --> 34:02.416
So where's the mother's touch
in a routine?

34:02.500 --> 34:05.291
-I find it cold and calculated.
-[Jennifer] Don't be stupid, Shanthi.

34:05.375 --> 34:08.041
It's more like it's well-thought-out
and organized.

34:08.125 --> 34:11.458
-But nothing beats love and affection.
-That is a given.

34:11.541 --> 34:14.583
But if you want to raise a winner,
it starts now. Every--

34:14.666 --> 34:15.625
[baby crying]

34:15.708 --> 34:19.416
Just hold on a second.
Hold on a second. Wait.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.250
-Jodi, what do you think you're doing?
-She's crying, Jen.

34:22.333 --> 34:23.750
Studies have shown

34:23.833 --> 34:27.125
that if you scurry around
at every peep a baby makes,

34:27.208 --> 34:29.250
then you just encourage
the wrong behavior.

34:29.333 --> 34:30.875
Just take your studies and shove it.

34:30.958 --> 34:33.875
-[crying stops]
-Look at that. You see?

34:33.958 --> 34:36.125
She stopped. What did I say?

34:36.208 --> 34:38.125
[sighing] Jodi, we're to help.

34:38.208 --> 34:41.666
I'm gonna take care of the baby,
and Jennifer's gonna do the cooking.

34:41.750 --> 34:42.791
Better we starve.

34:42.875 --> 34:45.500
[Prishen] There'll be no cooking today.
I've ordered.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.208
A toast to the newest addition
to our family.

34:49.291 --> 34:50.291
Yay.

34:50.375 --> 34:53.833
Jodi and Prishen,
you've given us the greatest gift.

34:54.625 --> 34:55.583
We love you guys.

34:55.666 --> 34:58.833
Oh, and she's absolutely beautiful.

34:58.916 --> 35:00.875
Plus too we came way Mauritius.

35:01.583 --> 35:04.541
Also, I want to say, two times I saw you.

35:05.125 --> 35:07.250
I didn't wanna make a big thing about it,

35:07.333 --> 35:11.333
but there and then,
I knew you could do it.

35:13.333 --> 35:14.958
-[clinking glass]
-[Elvis clears throat]

35:18.166 --> 35:19.500
[sighs]

35:19.583 --> 35:23.833
The birth of our granddaughter is a start
of a new legacy.

35:24.500 --> 35:27.125
You all know we've worked really hard
on our business.

35:27.208 --> 35:30.208
-Business? Bru, it's an empire.
-[all chuckle]

35:30.291 --> 35:34.625
And we have decided to pass it on.

35:34.708 --> 35:35.875
What you guys mean?

35:36.875 --> 35:38.625
[Elvis] Jodi, it's all yours.

35:39.166 --> 35:42.791
All yours. I mean,
this is our family legacy, Jodi,

35:42.875 --> 35:44.708
and we know that one day,

35:44.791 --> 35:47.208
you will pass it on
to our lovely granddaughter.

35:48.125 --> 35:51.708
Hey, bru, you know how many times
I nearly let the cat out of the bag?

35:53.333 --> 35:55.708
Wait, did you know about this?

35:57.416 --> 36:01.791
Uh, geez, Uncle Elvis, that's…
that's a lot to take in. Thank you.

36:01.875 --> 36:06.916
So everybody knew about this besides me?
Thanks for nothing, Jen.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.958
Prishen's right.
There's a lot to unpack here.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.625
Of course.
Like, are you guys gonna move back to SA?

36:11.708 --> 36:15.291
Is my son still gonna be a doctor?
What about baby number two?

36:16.166 --> 36:21.291
Wait. Let's ask Uncle Preggie
to help with the decisions

36:21.375 --> 36:23.541
since he knows everything!

36:24.333 --> 36:26.166
[Jennifer] Look, Shanthi,

36:26.250 --> 36:28.833
I think if we just give
Jodi and Prishen some time,

36:28.916 --> 36:31.458
then they'll just work it all out, right?

36:32.791 --> 36:34.666
Babe, where have you been?

36:35.833 --> 36:36.833
[shushing]

36:37.375 --> 36:39.291
The next nappy change is on you, Miss CEO.

36:39.375 --> 36:43.583
Please, you don't know how her.
She'll never let me make any decisions.

36:43.666 --> 36:47.625
Look, let's just serve dessert
and get through another sleepless night.

36:48.625 --> 36:50.166
-Come on.
-Come on.

36:52.166 --> 36:54.541
Bon appétit. Jodi made dessert.

36:54.625 --> 36:56.041
-[Preggie] Wow!
-[Jennifer] Oh!

36:56.125 --> 36:58.458
That looks fantastic, Jod.

36:58.541 --> 37:00.083
-[Preggie] Thank you.
-Jodi!

37:01.125 --> 37:02.333
You made that?

37:02.416 --> 37:05.583
So, guys, have you thought of a name
for the baby yet?

37:06.500 --> 37:08.625
Elvis is named after Elvis Presley.

37:09.333 --> 37:13.291
I was thinking of my favorite song,
"Waltzing Matilda."

37:13.875 --> 37:15.041
How's Matilda?

37:15.125 --> 37:16.250
Don't ask me.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.541
I'm sure these ones must've already chosen
a name for the baby.

37:20.625 --> 37:23.000
Elvis? Jennifer?

37:24.416 --> 37:25.291
Preggie.

37:25.375 --> 37:27.000
The planning committee.

37:27.791 --> 37:28.708
Shanthi, come on.

37:28.791 --> 37:31.416
I just wanted it to be a lovely surprise.
That's all.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.500
There's nothing lovely
about keeping secrets from your friend

37:35.083 --> 37:36.041
and your wife.

37:36.625 --> 37:39.166
Hey, who made this tea? It's tops, huh?

37:39.250 --> 37:40.333
It's really tasty.

37:40.416 --> 37:41.916
That's because I made it.

37:42.416 --> 37:45.250
Anyway, getting back
to the naming ceremony.

37:45.333 --> 37:48.875
We want something small and simple
right here with just us.

37:48.958 --> 37:54.208
So I like the names Vidya, Mahalakshmi…

37:54.291 --> 37:55.250
No.

37:55.333 --> 37:56.583
…and Divya.

37:56.666 --> 37:58.000
Mm-mm.

37:58.083 --> 38:00.625
I think we should go
with something more modern and cute.

38:00.708 --> 38:05.083
-Like Leia, or Lexi, or Lara.
-No.

38:05.166 --> 38:06.750
-Yeah?
-No, no, no, no, no.

38:06.833 --> 38:09.041
So what were the initials you got?

38:09.125 --> 38:10.291
A.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.708
-Uh, SA.
-And MA.

38:11.791 --> 38:12.666
[Aya] Wait.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.291
MA. Matilda?

38:15.375 --> 38:18.416
Aya, this tea is tops, huh? Mm.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.333
-[Elvis] Yeah.
-So nice and sweet.

38:20.416 --> 38:23.666
Um, I think Mauritian sugar is sweeter
than ours, huh?

38:23.750 --> 38:24.791
Mm, mm.

38:24.875 --> 38:27.458
Wait. Aya, which milk did you use?

38:28.041 --> 38:28.916
Um…

38:29.583 --> 38:33.041
A small cute container in the fridge
with a pink lid.

38:33.125 --> 38:34.583
-That's my breast milk.
-[Prishen] Oh!

38:34.666 --> 38:36.500
[Preggie and Elvis spit and gag]

38:36.583 --> 38:37.666
Good.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.083
-Okay.
-[Elvis grunts]

38:44.833 --> 38:46.666
[Jennifer clears throat, sighs]

38:48.625 --> 38:50.041
See here, son.

38:50.125 --> 38:55.458
Now that you're a dad,
you must know the do's and the don'ts.

38:55.541 --> 38:57.375
-Yeah.
-Wait. See here.

38:58.250 --> 39:01.291
Because we've been
to hell and back, boy. Yeah.

39:01.375 --> 39:04.083
So listen to us
like your future depends on this, huh?

39:04.166 --> 39:07.500
Yeah. You see, now that the baby is here…

39:08.625 --> 39:10.583
you gotta manage expectations.

39:10.666 --> 39:12.833
You know what we mean by expectations?

39:12.916 --> 39:16.333
Now if you get lucky twice a year,
that's a top thing.

39:16.416 --> 39:21.083
Yeah. And now you must start pretending
that you're losing your hearing.

39:21.666 --> 39:24.958
You must say it's genetic,
and you must practice it.

39:25.791 --> 39:26.833
What?

39:26.916 --> 39:28.166
-[laughs]
-Exactly.

39:28.250 --> 39:32.708
Yeah. Because the baby's gonna cry
and cry a lot.

39:33.375 --> 39:36.416
So if you can't hear,
she's going to get tired of complaining

39:36.500 --> 39:38.708
and sort the baby out herself, you see?

39:38.791 --> 39:42.458
-But, Uncle Elvis, I really want to help.
-Hey, hey, hey. Shh.

39:43.208 --> 39:45.083
Keep quiet and listen carefully.

39:45.166 --> 39:49.791
Now, not only are you losing your hearing,
you're also constipated.

39:49.875 --> 39:53.875
Yeah, then if you go to the toilet,
you can take as long as you want to.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.000
That gives you a good time-out, boy.

39:56.083 --> 40:00.833
And if you got any friends
who are good at cooking, cleaning,

40:00.916 --> 40:03.666
uh, feeding, looking after the children…

40:03.750 --> 40:06.125
-Dump them.
-Yeah. You know why?

40:06.750 --> 40:11.125
Because if Jodi meets them,
she's gonna compare you to them.

40:11.208 --> 40:15.708
So you must have friends
who are lazy, dirty.

40:15.791 --> 40:17.750
So you become the benchmark, boy.

40:17.833 --> 40:18.791
[Preggie] Hmm.

40:18.875 --> 40:21.625
-So that's why you two are best friends?
-[both] Hey.

40:21.708 --> 40:25.416
Don't get clever, yeah. Just listen to us.
That's all I'm saying. Tell him. Tell him.

40:25.500 --> 40:28.875
Oh, thank God.
I could do with some good news tonight.

40:28.958 --> 40:31.708
You know, I just spoke to Desan,
and he's so worried.

40:32.791 --> 40:34.666
[woman] I don't think
you understand, Shanthi.

40:34.750 --> 40:38.083
Desan is the problem here,
and the petition is to get him expelled.

40:39.375 --> 40:42.000
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean? [inhales sharply]

40:42.083 --> 40:44.625
We didn't find out exactly what--

40:44.708 --> 40:48.000
[woman] Shanthi, your child
is making my child's life a misery.

40:48.083 --> 40:50.666
I'm not interested in your stories.
Just go to hell.

40:50.750 --> 40:52.083
[line disconnects]

40:52.166 --> 40:53.750
[somber flute music playing]

41:13.083 --> 41:14.333
[phone chimes, vibrates]

41:15.625 --> 41:17.166

41:18.666 --> 41:20.125

41:22.333 --> 41:23.833

41:33.083 --> 41:35.958
[sighing]

41:38.083 --> 41:40.291
[baby crying]

41:40.375 --> 41:41.541
[sighs heavily]

41:50.791 --> 41:52.791
Preggs, I called her.

41:52.875 --> 41:54.875
Hmm. What did she say?

41:54.958 --> 41:59.583
So I sent her pics
of Desan crying and his injuries.

41:59.666 --> 42:01.250
So will she call the school?

42:01.333 --> 42:05.000
Yeah, she's on board. She said
she'll give the school a call today,

42:05.083 --> 42:07.333
and she will give them
our side of the story.

42:08.416 --> 42:10.250
But this thing needs to get sorted,
eh, Shanthi?

42:10.333 --> 42:12.750
-True, huh?
-We still don't know who's behind this.

42:13.375 --> 42:15.958
[Jodi] So, there's gateaux piments.
It's chili bhajias.

42:16.041 --> 42:19.000
Mauritian cari, dhal puri,
boulettes, which are dumplings,

42:19.083 --> 42:23.291
and of course, bol renversé,
an upside-down bowl stir-fry.

42:23.375 --> 42:24.208
[all] Wow!

42:24.291 --> 42:26.041
[Prishen] My wife has been
upping her game.

42:26.125 --> 42:28.750
Jodi! Oh my goodness.

42:28.833 --> 42:30.291
Jodi, sweetheart.

42:30.375 --> 42:32.416
This looks amazing, Jods.

42:32.500 --> 42:35.375
So, Jodi, where did you learn all this?

42:35.458 --> 42:36.708
Classified info.

42:37.666 --> 42:40.500
You're brilliant in the kitchen.
Soon, the boardroom.

42:40.583 --> 42:42.000
You're my superwoman.

42:42.083 --> 42:45.416
Hello? Anybody seen the real Jennifer?

42:45.500 --> 42:46.750
[Preggie] Well, what a feast.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.375
-You're really killing it, Jodi.
-Thank you.

42:49.458 --> 42:52.958
[Elvis] I can't wait
for you to be CEO, Jen Junior.

42:54.166 --> 42:56.708
[Jennifer] Absolutely.
We should drink to that.

42:57.291 --> 43:01.583
Jodi, do you know
how to make that, uh, "cockamole"?

43:02.166 --> 43:03.500
Oh. [chuckles]

43:09.041 --> 43:11.083
Oh, she's finally asleep. [sighs]

43:11.166 --> 43:12.791
-Finally.
-[sighs]

43:12.875 --> 43:15.916
Hey, proud husband moment today,
Miss Master Chef.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.166
Hmm.

43:17.250 --> 43:19.041
Even your mom had nothing bad to say.

43:19.958 --> 43:20.958
[chuckles softly]

43:47.416 --> 43:48.916
[breathing heavily]

43:50.375 --> 43:53.208
[Prishen] Hey, babe,
the weather seems like it's clearing up.

43:53.291 --> 43:56.833
Oh, today's gonna be such a good day.
We're gonna have so much of fun,

43:56.916 --> 43:59.250
and someone's in a good mood.

43:59.333 --> 44:00.208
Hey.

44:00.875 --> 44:02.333
[Jodi breathing shakily]

-[upbeat song playing on radio]
-[Aya snoring]

44:46.041 --> 44:48.833
[Preggie on phone] Hey, howzit, boy?
Yeah, it's Daddy here.

44:48.916 --> 44:53.291
"Daddy"? Dad, what's going on?
Are you guys on the road already?

44:53.375 --> 44:58.666
Hey, yeah, life can just change, yeah.
Things are so unpredictable, man.

44:58.750 --> 45:01.000
-Dad, are you okay?
-Elvis, what you said?

45:01.083 --> 45:06.375
Um, tell Prishen that Seven Sands
seemed closer than we thought.

45:06.458 --> 45:09.625
Seven Sands? Dad, I'm so confused.

45:09.708 --> 45:13.625
Yeah, you know,
we thought it'll be about 15, 20,

45:13.708 --> 45:17.333
uh, but it's looking more like…
[spluttering] …like seven, like seven.

45:17.416 --> 45:19.791
Sands? Seven Sands?

45:19.875 --> 45:21.625
[laughing] No, about five.

45:22.541 --> 45:24.083
But there's no Five Sands.

45:24.666 --> 45:27.250
Exactly, son. You know, just five.

45:27.333 --> 45:30.458
F-I-V-E, five.

45:31.375 --> 45:33.416
Oh! You guys are five minutes away?

45:33.500 --> 45:34.416
Exactly, son.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.833
[laughing] Hey,
that's why you're a doctor, eh?

45:38.041 --> 45:41.000
Babe, you bring the bag.
I got the basket. Let's go.

45:43.666 --> 45:44.791
[both] Oh, shit!

45:47.208 --> 45:48.541
[baby cooing]

45:48.625 --> 45:51.583
-Hey, honey. Hey, baby. Hi.
-Hi.

45:51.666 --> 45:52.583
Sorry.

45:52.666 --> 45:54.625
-[both chuckle]
-Whew!

45:56.333 --> 45:59.083
Uh, Moothoo, uh, what's that sound?

45:59.166 --> 46:00.041
What sound, sir?

46:00.916 --> 46:03.250
Elvis, you can hear it, eh?

46:05.000 --> 46:07.750
-There, that sound.
-Yeah, loud and clear. Loud and clear.

46:07.833 --> 46:11.000
Hey, bro, that sounds
like a gudgeon pin knock, man.

46:11.708 --> 46:13.666
-Can you hear anything?
-I can't hear anything.

46:13.750 --> 46:14.666
[shushing]

46:15.625 --> 46:18.041
There, there, there.
I think just play safe, Moothoo.

46:18.125 --> 46:21.250
Pull over here. Uh, we'll check it out.
Right here, right here.

46:23.708 --> 46:25.000
[both giggling]

46:26.500 --> 46:28.208

-[phone beeps]
-[Shanthi] Where are you all?

46:45.250 --> 46:46.375
Where are you all?

46:46.458 --> 46:48.041
Oh, we just popped by.

46:48.125 --> 46:52.458
Uh, I think I left my pressure tablets
in your kitchen.

46:52.541 --> 46:54.000
What a story they're cooking!

46:54.083 --> 46:57.083
[muffled] They're bluffing, Prishen!
They're bluffing, Prishen!

46:57.583 --> 47:01.916
[whispering] Shut up, Ma. Do you wanna get
your false teeth sucked out again? Shh!

47:02.000 --> 47:03.291
No problem. Anjali has a key.

47:03.375 --> 47:06.500
Wait! Did you all take the baby
out of the house?

47:06.583 --> 47:09.541
[Prishen] Yeah, we had an appointment
with the pediatrician.

47:10.875 --> 47:12.041
-God!
-What?

47:12.125 --> 47:14.791
Bad winds and everything.
Why are they like this?

47:14.875 --> 47:17.375
[Prishen] Get the key from Anjali
and make yourselves comfortable.

47:17.458 --> 47:18.583
Okay, bye.

47:19.791 --> 47:21.625
Boom. That's how it's done.

47:23.083 --> 47:24.833
Jods, hello. Anyone home?

47:26.208 --> 47:27.333
[sighs]

47:29.416 --> 47:31.000
They gave you the duck.

47:31.083 --> 47:32.416
Just keep quiet, Ma.

47:33.083 --> 47:37.041
Shanthi, listen, I'm thinking
this could work in our favor with Anjali.

47:37.125 --> 47:38.958
Yeah, nice to get to know her.

47:39.458 --> 47:41.625
-I will happily skip the gardens.
-Yeah.

47:41.708 --> 47:43.541
Me too. Gardens you see everywhere--

47:43.625 --> 47:46.750
No. You don't make your own stories.
You're going with Elvis and Preggie.

47:46.833 --> 47:48.166
-Elvis and Preggie?
-Exactly.

47:48.250 --> 47:49.291
So boring.

47:49.375 --> 47:50.625
And your friend, Moothoo.

47:51.583 --> 47:53.916
-Oh. Now you put it like that…
-Yeah.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.291
We need to suss her out, Jen.
Because we're gonna be gone in a few days.

47:58.375 --> 48:00.125
Yeah, but Anjali is here to stay.

48:00.791 --> 48:02.875
I'm just trying to think ahead, Shanthi.

48:02.958 --> 48:05.416
-Jodi has a massive task ahead of her.
-True.

48:05.500 --> 48:08.750
I mean, some women are very happy
to just stay at home.

48:10.166 --> 48:14.166
And there's nothing wrong with that.
Nothing wrong with that at all.

48:14.250 --> 48:16.833
Don't beat around the bush.
Just say what you wanna say, man.

48:16.916 --> 48:20.750
It's just some women are cut differently.
That's all I'm saying, Shanthi.

48:20.833 --> 48:24.708
And I'm saying that some women need
to be cut down to size.

48:25.458 --> 48:26.625
That's all I'm saying.

48:27.125 --> 48:30.583
[Indian classical music playing]

48:32.541 --> 48:34.375
[Jennifer] Wow!

48:34.958 --> 48:37.541
Well, it's quite a pleasant surprise
to have you both here.

48:37.625 --> 48:41.458
Well, I must say
you have the most beautiful home, Anjali.

48:41.541 --> 48:44.041
And… and you look gorgeous by the way.

48:44.125 --> 48:45.375
Oh, thanks, Aunty Jen.

48:45.958 --> 48:47.916
You guys are missing the gardens.

48:48.625 --> 48:49.458
Uh… [clears throat]

48:49.541 --> 48:53.083
Yeah, that's my fault.
I had such a splitting headache.

48:53.166 --> 48:54.666
Oh, she had a horrible headache,

48:54.750 --> 48:57.708
and obviously, I decided
to stay and take care of Shanthi.

48:57.791 --> 48:59.166
[Shanthi] Yeah, she did.

48:59.250 --> 49:01.875
But everybody else is enjoying themselves,
I'm sure.

49:01.958 --> 49:04.583
-Mmm.
-Especially Aya.

49:04.666 --> 49:06.875
-Oh, she loves it. Loves it.
-[upbeat music playing]

49:06.958 --> 49:09.750
-[exclaiming]
-Moothoo, don't be scared. I got this.

49:09.833 --> 49:11.916
-It's fine. Come on, Moothoo.
-No, Aya!

49:12.000 --> 49:14.250
Don't be scared. I got this.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.625
[tires screech]

49:19.708 --> 49:21.375
-Moothoo.
-[gasping]

49:21.458 --> 49:23.208
-I got this.
-Okay.

49:28.708 --> 49:31.916
Ma, I see you
and Moothoo are getting on very well.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.958
-He likes spending time with you.
-What's happening exactly, Aya?

49:35.041 --> 49:39.333
-Why? You think he's got an eye on me?
-[laughs] No, we're not saying that, Ma.

49:39.416 --> 49:42.541
Who can blame him?
I'm irresistible like that.

49:42.625 --> 49:43.541
[Moothoo panting]

49:43.625 --> 49:47.166
Ma, what we're saying is
that you can't trust anyone so easily.

49:47.250 --> 49:49.000
Hey, I'm not born yesterday.

49:49.083 --> 49:50.666
Aya, you didn't give him any money?

49:50.750 --> 49:52.250
Relax.

49:52.333 --> 49:53.916
[in Mauritian Creole] Everything is good.

49:54.541 --> 49:56.125
[in English] You okay there, Moothoo?

50:02.416 --> 50:06.625
Anjali, I absolutely cannot get over
the design of this house.

50:06.708 --> 50:10.458
Actually, it's all my husband.
He was an architect.

50:11.000 --> 50:11.958
"Was"?

50:12.958 --> 50:18.083
Well, he passed away last year.

50:18.666 --> 50:21.833
-Oh! Sorry.
-We're so sorry to hear that, Anjali.

50:22.500 --> 50:25.291
It can't be easy maintaining this house
without him.

50:25.375 --> 50:26.875
It's getting quite tough.

50:28.166 --> 50:30.916
I'm already looking
to some new business ideas.

50:38.416 --> 50:40.083
[baby crying]

50:48.541 --> 50:50.041
Sorry. I didn't hear her.

50:59.666 --> 51:00.791
[crying stops]

51:04.041 --> 51:06.500
-Yes!
-Yes! Well done.

51:06.583 --> 51:07.791
[cheering]

51:07.875 --> 51:11.125
Thanks so much, Anjali. I hope
this wasn't too much of an inconvenience.

51:11.208 --> 51:13.208
Are you kidding me? Your moms are awesome.

51:13.291 --> 51:15.291
-Anjali, you are such a hoot.
-Thank you.

51:15.375 --> 51:18.166
[Jennifer] Oh, by the way,
all the best with that business venture.

51:18.875 --> 51:21.041
-I know you're gonna be awesome.
-Thank you.

51:21.125 --> 51:22.541
[Jennifer] You got this, eh.

51:23.291 --> 51:25.291
-Brilliant.
-Take care. Bye.

51:25.375 --> 51:26.625
[giggles]

51:27.708 --> 51:32.708
Shanthi, like one miracle,
you got better so quickly.

51:32.791 --> 51:34.791
Hey, Jods, this is for you.

51:35.375 --> 51:37.500
You should try
and get a smoothie in every day

51:37.583 --> 51:39.041
to help you get back in shape.

51:39.125 --> 51:40.791
Says the person with no shape.

51:40.875 --> 51:43.625
You'll starve, Jodi.
That smoothie won't even say hello.

51:44.208 --> 51:46.583
Come on, every little bit helps.

51:46.666 --> 51:50.708
And you should also aim to get
into a little exercise routine. Hmm?

51:50.791 --> 51:52.916
You need to rest and restore.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.833
[whispering] And maybe tie the stomach.

51:54.916 --> 51:58.500
Hm-mm. Jodi needs to focus on her career.

51:58.583 --> 52:03.625
Hmm. The Kandasamy legacy, the big secret.

52:03.708 --> 52:06.083
[Jennifer sighs]
We all just want what's best for our kids.

52:06.166 --> 52:09.250
So then why was I
the only one left in the dark, Jen?

52:09.333 --> 52:11.500
Prishen, was there talk of a hurricane?

52:12.083 --> 52:13.166
[inhales sharply]

52:13.250 --> 52:16.500
Um, Mom, Aunty Jen, I need some advice.

52:16.583 --> 52:18.666
I've been off the rails
with my exercise and diet.

52:18.750 --> 52:19.958
I'm struggling to balance.

52:20.041 --> 52:25.083
Jodi, this boy is juggling so many things.
You must be more supportive, man.

52:25.166 --> 52:27.750
Exactly, sweetie.
I mean, pregnancy is not a sickness.

52:27.833 --> 52:29.458
What have you been doing?

52:29.541 --> 52:33.208
You don't really want your husband
to end up looking like a lump of lard.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.083
What is this?

52:38.750 --> 52:41.666
I was thinking
it'll be nice to give her a nice leg bath.

52:41.750 --> 52:44.375
-No.
-Shanthi, you're gonna fit on that thing?

52:44.875 --> 52:46.333
Rather I give the bath.

52:46.416 --> 52:48.500
[Indian classical music playing]

52:48.583 --> 52:51.166
[Shanthi] So tell me,
what do you think about Anjali?

52:51.250 --> 52:54.500
I… I was so surprised.
I felt actually drawn to her.

52:54.583 --> 52:57.750
You know, she reminded me
so much of myself. Like a mini-me.

52:58.541 --> 53:00.000
Oh no! Two of you.

53:02.291 --> 53:04.500
Oh, wow!

53:05.291 --> 53:08.791
Uh… Um, excuse me.
Are you sure it's one-size-fits-all?

53:08.875 --> 53:09.833
[shopkeeper] Yes.

53:10.541 --> 53:12.291
It's stretchy fabric, okay?

53:12.375 --> 53:15.583
Oh, Shanthi, stretch only goes so far.

53:15.666 --> 53:18.291
Body shaming. Pathetic, man!

53:18.375 --> 53:20.958
Anyway, I'll take two of these. Thanks.

53:27.583 --> 53:28.541
Indian gold?

53:29.166 --> 53:30.541
Not looking too yellow.

53:31.208 --> 53:34.166
Top-notch gold. It's a bargain.

53:35.458 --> 53:37.208
Only a bargain if it's free.

53:39.916 --> 53:42.375

Greetings, Guru!

53:54.291 --> 53:55.125
Greetings.

53:55.208 --> 53:57.583
[in English]
Anjali spoke so highly of you.

53:57.666 --> 53:59.625
Thank you. How is the baby?

53:59.708 --> 54:02.583
-She's the image of my son.
-My beautiful daughter.

54:03.458 --> 54:05.916
Oh, Guru, this temple is too stunning.

54:06.708 --> 54:07.541
Yes.

54:08.125 --> 54:09.833
It is. Isn't it?

54:10.916 --> 54:12.916
[Indian classical music playing]

54:14.750 --> 54:17.791

the naming ceremony without asking us?

-[baby crying]
-Who gave them permission? Huh?

54:19.958 --> 54:23.083
It's her. It's her.
She just… She just takes over.

54:23.166 --> 54:25.083
I didn't even get to choose the outfit.

54:25.166 --> 54:27.583
I mean, how am I supposed to get that
on a screaming baby?

-But…

54:35.083 --> 54:36.375
let's get it together.

54:37.041 --> 54:39.166
For her, for our daughter.

54:40.291 --> 54:42.833
-Okay? Together?
-[sighs heavily]

I think we did good today.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.333
See what happens when we all work together
without any secrets?

58:06.875 --> 58:09.500
[chuckles] Proud parent moments
for us today.

58:10.333 --> 58:13.208
You know, I think
we couldn't have asked for better kids.

58:13.291 --> 58:15.500
I could have asked
for a better daughter-in-law.

58:15.583 --> 58:16.500
[chuckles]

58:17.666 --> 58:21.750
And Jodi and Prishen,
they're really shining at this, eh.

58:22.708 --> 58:26.708
You know, I got some really good vibes
from Jodi today, Elvis.

58:26.791 --> 58:29.458
It was so nice
to see her show up like that,

58:29.541 --> 58:32.541
you know, like the woman
we brought her up to be.

58:32.625 --> 58:36.500
It'd be nicer if you told her, not us.
It builds them up.

58:37.625 --> 58:38.458
I agree.

58:39.041 --> 58:41.000
No harm in praising our kids.

58:41.500 --> 58:44.375
Serious harm in over-praising
if you ask me.

58:44.458 --> 58:46.250
As usual, no one asked you.

58:46.333 --> 58:49.291
[chuckles]

58:50.666 --> 58:53.458
[Jennifer] Moothoo, is this
the way back to Jodi's place?

58:53.541 --> 58:56.083
[Elvis] I'm sure the driver knows
which way to take.

59:05.791 --> 59:07.208
[speaking indistinctly]

59:07.291 --> 59:09.708
[Aya] Preggie, take one selfie
of me and the coconut.

59:09.791 --> 59:10.625
Moothoo?

59:11.166 --> 59:13.791
[Preggie] Aya, hit one pose
and say "coconut."

59:15.250 --> 59:16.416
Moothoo.

59:16.500 --> 59:18.958
I thought we had an understanding.

59:19.041 --> 59:22.083
Madame, you're not understanding
that it was a misunderstanding.

59:22.166 --> 59:25.083
No, no, no, no, no.
There was no misunderstanding.

59:25.166 --> 59:29.500
I pay you, and you need to do as I say.
It's as simple as that.

59:29.583 --> 59:30.875
It's not that simple.

59:32.583 --> 59:35.166
Okay, I see what is going on here.

59:36.416 --> 59:38.833
-[chopping]
-Ooh! [chuckles]

59:38.916 --> 59:40.875
I will pay you a higher price,

59:40.958 --> 59:43.958
and I will put it in the envelope,
put my name on it--

59:44.041 --> 59:48.458
No, no, no. No price. No more.
[in Mauritian Creole] Everything is good?

59:48.541 --> 59:50.291
[in English] No. No, no, no.

59:50.375 --> 59:51.750
No drese patout.

59:51.833 --> 59:56.083
No everything is good,
because everything is bad, very bad.

59:56.166 --> 01:00:00.250
We had a deal, Moothoo.
You can't back out of that now.

01:00:01.666 --> 01:00:03.000
Excusez-moi.

Why do you say
I'm throwing money away, Jen?

01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:19.041
Oh, please, Elvis, I don't have to be
Sherlock Holmes to figure that out.

-[Elvis sighs]
-Why are y'all screaming?

01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:26.041
Go on, deny it. Deny it.
What did you pay him the money for?

01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:27.791
-It was a tip.
-Bullshit!

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:30.750
Look, Preggie, Prishen, they said that--

01:00:30.833 --> 01:00:31.833
[Jennifer] Elvis!

01:00:33.458 --> 01:00:35.666
Fine. Okay, fine.

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:37.708
Prishen came to us for some help.

01:00:38.291 --> 01:00:41.041
So you and Preggie are now psychologists
all of a sudden.

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:43.458
Only one psycho here,
and we all know who that is.

01:00:43.541 --> 01:00:45.625
Look, if you give me a chance,
I can explain--

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:48.458
Explain what, Elvis?
How stupid you and Peggie are?

01:00:48.541 --> 01:00:50.041
What are you all arguing about?

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:55.250
Ma, your highly educated son
gave Moothoo dollars, Ma.

01:00:55.333 --> 01:00:58.541
That Moothoo is a conman,
and you'd better watch your back as well.

01:00:58.625 --> 01:01:00.916
I'm watching my back
from the time my son got married.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.916
Ma, this is not a joke, okay?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.625
I'm also worried
that he could be taking you for a ride.

01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:09.125
He's a driver.
That's his job, to take people for a ride.

01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:11.875
[tuts] Just don't give him any money.

01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:14.833
Jen… [sighs]

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
[Indian percussion music playing]

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:28.416
[Moothoo grunts]

01:01:28.916 --> 01:01:29.958
[spluttering]

01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:31.875
[in Mauritian Creole]
Everything is good, eh?

01:01:32.458 --> 01:01:35.125
[in English] It was a mistake.
I don't know how she found out.

01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:36.541
I could smack you, huh?

01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:40.083
We should both klap you.
You know how much of trouble we're in?

01:01:40.166 --> 01:01:42.625
-Mr. Preggie, you never gave me money.
-Good!

01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:46.458
You didn't take me to the Seven Sands,
bloody idiot.

01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:50.791
I have your Seven Sands.

01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:58.125
Elvis, this guy got attitude.

01:01:58.208 --> 01:01:59.916
Hey, just hold me back, Preggie!

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.875
-Hold me back!
-Hold him back!

01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:03.166
[music ends]

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:06.041
Aunty Jen, Aunty Shanthi, you were saying?

01:02:06.125 --> 01:02:07.250
Well, I'm saying, Anj,

01:02:07.333 --> 01:02:10.166
that I'm so impressed
by your drive and your discipline.

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:12.750
And we think you are lovely, and so…

01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:15.625
So, I want to invest in your idea.

01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:17.000
Très bien. Sounds good.

01:02:17.083 --> 01:02:18.541
And the second part is…

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:20.708
And it's no secret.

01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:24.916
We think that you'd make the perfect nanny
for our baby.

01:02:35.916 --> 01:02:38.166
[Shanthi] So nice we got this photo shoot.

01:02:39.916 --> 01:02:43.083
Hey, Shants, we need to talk, eh?

01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:46.166
Hey, lucky I waxed my legs, huh?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.833
-Shoot.
-It's about Desan.

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:53.750
Jen?

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.500
Jen?

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.250
-Jennifer?
-[Jennifer] Ma?

01:02:58.875 --> 01:02:59.958
[Aya] Come here.

01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:03.250
Ma.

01:03:03.833 --> 01:03:06.333
How long you're taking?
What, I must drown, yeah?

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:09.791
[signs disgustedly] If only.
Cut out the drama. What do you want?

01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:11.875
Pass me my towel.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.583
You called me for that?

01:03:13.666 --> 01:03:17.041
While you're there,
pass me my, um, this thing.

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:18.458
Your what?

01:03:19.125 --> 01:03:20.875
My unmentionables.

01:03:20.958 --> 01:03:23.333
Your underwear? You forgot your underwear?

01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:25.875
You don't have to spell it out like that.

01:03:25.958 --> 01:03:28.625
Why you think they call it unmentionables?

01:03:31.416 --> 01:03:32.583
[Jennifer groans]

01:03:34.291 --> 01:03:35.250
Ugh.

01:03:36.166 --> 01:03:40.083
While you're there,
just bring my spencer also. Onetime.

01:03:42.416 --> 01:03:43.333
Hmm.

01:03:44.291 --> 01:03:45.416
[mutters, sighs]

01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:54.958
[comical music playing]

01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:59.708
Ma, how devious can you be?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.791
How can you lie to your own son?

01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:04.416
[Aya] Pot calling the kettle black.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.333
I'm gonna tell Elvis
you gave Moothoo money.

01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:11.041
Don't you dare. I'm gonna tell Elvis
you conspired with Moothoo.

01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:16.000
Who do you think he's gonna believe?
Me or you?

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:25.000
Now, don't go touching
other people's things. Hmm?

01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:30.166
The email from the school was clear.
Desan is suspended.

01:04:31.166 --> 01:04:33.333
But I thought everything was sorted out.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.958
Well, one child finally came forward
with what actually happened.

01:04:39.416 --> 01:04:41.333
-I saw the video.
-And?

01:04:41.416 --> 01:04:42.333
It's bad.

01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:45.291
Let me see.

01:04:48.166 --> 01:04:50.875
Hey, where are you going?
You're staying with me, okay?

01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:54.208
[chuckles] Yeah, you're staying with me.
You're not going anywhere, okay.

01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:58.833
-Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Watch it.
-[boy on video] Desan, stop it!

01:04:58.916 --> 01:05:01.666
-Desan!
-You shut up, okay? This is my territory.

01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:04.000
Come here. You're not going anywhere, huh?

01:05:04.083 --> 01:05:05.250
[laughing]

01:05:17.625 --> 01:05:19.041
[Aya] What we gotta do?

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:24.250
Nothing, Ma. It's a photo shoot.
They'll give you some props and all that.

01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:25.666
Just go have some fun.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.875
I'm not in a fun mood.

01:05:28.708 --> 01:05:30.416
Welcome to Jennifer's world.

01:05:30.958 --> 01:05:33.541
A world filled with crooks and robbers.

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:35.333
If the cap fits, wear it.

01:05:39.791 --> 01:05:42.833
Guys, remember when Jodi cooked for us?

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:46.166
[Elvis] Who can forget?
That was a top chow there, that.

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:50.416
At my age, food is like medicine.
Goes in, comes out.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.083
Did she make dhal puri?

01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:54.958
[Elvis] Yeah, and dumplings
and a stir-fry.

01:05:55.625 --> 01:06:00.375
She's done really well,
hasn't she, our Jodi?

01:06:03.083 --> 01:06:04.291
What are you doing, Ma?

01:06:04.375 --> 01:06:07.541
Looks like you're having a stroke
or something. [chuckles]

01:06:07.625 --> 01:06:10.250
-I'm practicing smiling for the photos.
-Oh.

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.375
[tuts] You do know
how all the youngsters do.

01:06:12.458 --> 01:06:13.708
[laughs]

01:06:17.416 --> 01:06:21.583
Babe, should we carry some jackets?
The weather looks like it's changing.

01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:24.125
-Prish…
-And I need more nappies.

01:06:25.041 --> 01:06:26.583
-Prishen.
-Hmm?

01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:30.000
I'm feeling out of sorts.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.500
[Prishen sighs]

01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:38.916
Come on, I'm right here.

01:06:40.416 --> 01:06:42.541
I don't know if I wanna be a mom anymore.

01:06:45.083 --> 01:06:47.541
Babe, What you're feeling
is all Jennifer and Shanthi--

01:06:47.625 --> 01:06:48.583
It's not them.

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:51.708
-Of course, it's them.
-Look at me. [sobs]

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:53.958
It's me.

01:06:54.875 --> 01:06:56.708
[sobbing] I don't wanna be with her.

01:06:58.583 --> 01:07:00.000
My own baby.

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:01.583
[somber music playing]

01:07:02.416 --> 01:07:04.250
How long have you felt this way?

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:08.500
What's happening to me, Prishen?

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:17.375
[indistinct chatter]

01:07:34.958 --> 01:07:36.583
[Prishen] Ready? Watch this.

01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:40.583
[Jodi] Oh! Oh!

01:07:41.583 --> 01:07:42.916
-[Prishen] Oh.
-[Jodie laughs]

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.166
And that's what happens
when you try to juggle, Prishen.

01:07:48.083 --> 01:07:49.208
Excuse me?

01:07:49.291 --> 01:07:52.750
[Jennifer] And, Jodi, you're at the start
of your balancing act.

01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:55.250
[Prishen] Life's too short
to be a balancing act.

01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:59.250
Uh, sorry. Hold on.
I was talking to Jodi, my daughter.

01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:00.583
Who happens to be my wife.

01:08:00.666 --> 01:08:02.250
I don't think she meant it like--

01:08:02.333 --> 01:08:05.583
What I meant is that
sometimes things are not as they seem.

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:07.333
What are you talking about now?

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:10.166
I'm talking about
Jodi's act the other day,

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:12.625
when she "cooked" for lunch.

01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:14.708
You didn't know, Prishen?

01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:19.291
Aw, shame! I thought
the two of you were a team. Hey?

01:08:19.375 --> 01:08:22.333
Aunty Jennifer,
I'm asking you very politely to back off!

01:08:22.416 --> 01:08:23.833
Prishen, what's wrong with you?

01:08:23.916 --> 01:08:26.666
Come on, Jodi, speak. Why're you so quiet?

01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:30.375
Some people like to be quiet.
Not everybody got a big mouth like you.

01:08:30.458 --> 01:08:33.375
Admit it. Tell Prishen
how you lied to him about cooking lunch,

01:08:33.458 --> 01:08:35.000
how your neighbor Anjali did it,

01:08:35.083 --> 01:08:38.208
how you listened to all our compliments
and said absolutely nothing--

01:08:38.291 --> 01:08:40.125
Aunty Jennifer, if you don't shut up--

01:08:40.208 --> 01:08:42.791
You watch your mouth
when you're talking to me,

01:08:42.875 --> 01:08:45.625
you little nipper.
Who the hell do you think you are,

01:08:45.708 --> 01:08:49.708
giving us scheduled times
to see our grandchild, hmm?

01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:52.583
And sending us to stay far away.
Sis, Prishen.

01:08:53.083 --> 01:08:55.416
But it's obvious, Shanthi,
that's what they would do

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:58.333
because they didn't want us
to see their inadequacies.

01:08:58.416 --> 01:08:59.458
What inadequacies, Ma?

01:08:59.541 --> 01:09:02.083
-[Prishen] She's not worth it.
-[Jennifer] Who's she?

01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:04.250
'Cause that's what
we mean to them, outsiders.

01:09:04.333 --> 01:09:08.666
After everything we did for you,
you ungrateful little shit.

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:10.833
Like making huge life decisions for us.

01:09:10.916 --> 01:09:12.958
He's right, Jennifer. He's right.

01:09:13.041 --> 01:09:16.791
You can't expect my child
to leave everything and run your business.

01:09:16.875 --> 01:09:18.250
[Jennifer] What are you on about?

01:09:18.333 --> 01:09:21.875
We are giving them a golden future
on a platter.

01:09:21.958 --> 01:09:26.083
Yeah, but it's always
about your legacy, your child. Isn't?

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:27.333
You're also so selfish--

01:09:27.416 --> 01:09:29.500
Oh, please, Ma.
You're no better with Desan.

01:09:30.333 --> 01:09:32.000
What are you talking about, Prishen?

01:09:32.083 --> 01:09:34.791
No one can ever say
that I don't love my children.

01:09:34.875 --> 01:09:37.541
Then why is he still using
that small, pokey little room, huh?

01:09:37.625 --> 01:09:39.458
Your mother's going through a lot.
Just relax.

01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:42.416
No, Dad. No.
These two went behind our backs

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.000
and offered Anjali a job
to look after our baby--

01:09:45.083 --> 01:09:47.875
"Our baby. Our this, our that."

01:09:47.958 --> 01:09:52.333
Why don't you stop whining
and just grow up?

01:09:52.416 --> 01:09:54.416
[Arya crying]

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.791
[Shanthi] Prishen?

01:09:55.875 --> 01:09:57.875
[somber flute music playing]

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.208
You just don't get it, do you?

01:10:23.166 --> 01:10:25.541
I was just trying to help her.

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:31.583
Help her? She's fine compared to you
when you were a new mother.

01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:36.666
Because I couldn't cope, Ma.
I couldn't manage.

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:38.125
You were a useless mother.

01:10:38.208 --> 01:10:40.208
-Yeah.
-[Aya] You and I both knew it.

01:10:40.291 --> 01:10:41.583
Yeah, I was useless.

01:10:42.666 --> 01:10:45.833
[shakily] You knew it. I knew it.
Everybody knew it.

01:10:45.916 --> 01:10:48.750
You made sure of that, didn't you?

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.208
[voice breaking] I was a new mother.

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:57.041
I was overwhelmed,
and confused, and scared.

01:10:58.291 --> 01:11:03.000
I was falling apart. I needed you, Ma.

01:11:04.875 --> 01:11:07.250
You saw me struggling.

01:11:07.333 --> 01:11:09.083
Why didn't you help me?

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:11.625
[sniffles] Why didn't you help me?

01:11:13.375 --> 01:11:14.541
What did you do?

01:11:15.208 --> 01:11:21.500
You went to Elvis,
and you told him I was weak and needy.

01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:27.125
I was drowning, Ma. I was drowning.

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:31.041
You made me feel
like something was wrong with me.

01:11:32.291 --> 01:11:33.791
How could you do that?

01:11:37.375 --> 01:11:40.583
No woman should ever go through that.

01:11:42.291 --> 01:11:43.125
Ever.

01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:48.291
[crying] I just wanted
to make it easier for my child.

01:11:48.875 --> 01:11:52.416
I just wanted to make it easier
for my child.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.708
[Elvis shushes]

01:11:54.625 --> 01:11:57.125
-[Jennifer crying]
-[somber flute music playing]

01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:13.000
[Desan on video] You shut up, okay?
This is my territory.

01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:15.208
Come here. Come here.

01:12:15.708 --> 01:12:17.750
[video continues indistinctly]

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.833
[somber music continues]

01:12:24.291 --> 01:12:26.458
[Shanthi sniffling]

01:12:32.125 --> 01:12:36.625
[phone ringing]

01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:39.083
-[phone beeps]
-[sniffles]

01:12:41.916 --> 01:12:43.208
Anjali?

01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:46.000
[Anjali] Aunty Jen,
I needed to tell you something.

01:12:46.833 --> 01:12:48.125
It's not a good time.

01:12:49.416 --> 01:12:52.791
[Anjali] Jodi wanted to do
something special for you, her family.

01:12:56.083 --> 01:12:57.500
What are you talking about?

01:12:58.125 --> 01:13:02.291
[Anjali] The cooking, Aunty Jen.
I didn't do it. I taught Jodi.

01:13:02.375 --> 01:13:06.916
She made me teach her weeks ago.
But on that day, it was all her.

01:13:08.583 --> 01:13:09.791
[cries]

01:13:13.541 --> 01:13:14.833
[line disconnects]

01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:20.375
[Aya] There are moments in life

01:13:21.416 --> 01:13:26.291
when we suddenly realize the impact
of our action on others…

01:13:34.541 --> 01:13:36.708
Do I really love Prishen more?

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:46.583
[Aya] …moments when we take time out
to accept and to heal.

01:13:53.583 --> 01:13:56.583
But before we heal, we hurt.

01:13:59.166 --> 01:14:01.000
We hurt very badly.

01:14:07.875 --> 01:14:10.750
But it's not always easy to forgive,
is it?

01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:26.541
Nor is it easy to ask for forgiveness.

01:15:05.416 --> 01:15:06.625
[somber music fades out]

01:15:07.291 --> 01:15:09.166
Remember when we started the business

01:15:10.416 --> 01:15:12.083
out of our own garage?

01:15:12.833 --> 01:15:17.333
Yeah. Working 18 hours a day non-stop.

01:15:18.583 --> 01:15:21.166
Using every last cent of our savings.

01:15:21.833 --> 01:15:24.458
[chuckles] Borrowing from Peter
to pay Paul.

01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:26.208
[sighs]

01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:28.958
You heading some branches, me the others.

01:15:31.708 --> 01:15:34.500
We really did build something,
didn't we, Elvis?

01:15:35.916 --> 01:15:37.000
It was you, Jen,

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:40.083
working tirelessly in the office.

01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:43.958
I was just so happy
to build a family legacy.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.791
No. No.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.250
It was us.

01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:52.875
It was us.

01:15:54.875 --> 01:15:58.333
Building the Kandasamy family business.

01:16:00.208 --> 01:16:02.875
All so we could pass it on
to our daughter.

01:16:06.416 --> 01:16:08.041
That's all I ever wanted.

01:16:11.083 --> 01:16:12.916
-I messed up.
-[sighs]

01:16:14.708 --> 01:16:16.333
I don't know how to fix it.

01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:21.958
[Elvis sighs heavily]

01:16:29.791 --> 01:16:30.750
[Preggie] Shanthi.

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:34.208
Desan won a competition.

01:16:34.291 --> 01:16:36.583
-What competition?
-A poetry slam.

01:16:36.666 --> 01:16:38.958
I sent it to everyone. Watch with me.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.875
[playing beat on tabla]

01:16:47.875 --> 01:16:50.666
When I look in the mirror
Do you know what I see?

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:52.500
Just a stupid fool looking back at me

01:16:52.583 --> 01:16:55.625
Can never get things right
No matter how much I try

01:16:55.708 --> 01:16:58.833
Desan, why you can't be like Prishen?
He's the perfect guy

01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:02.958
Mom sees him as a hero

01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:05.083
Me, I'm just a second child, a zero

01:17:05.166 --> 01:17:10.333
Secondhand toys, secondhand clothing
Maybe it's secondhand love I'm receiving

01:17:12.458 --> 01:17:15.958
"Desan, you're stupid.
You didn't even know which side to go."

01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:19.291
"If Prishen was here,
he would have covered the whole goalpost."

01:17:23.666 --> 01:17:26.250
When my parents look at me
Do you know what they see?

01:17:26.333 --> 01:17:28.500
The black sheep of the family

01:17:30.875 --> 01:17:33.416
Walk around with a smile
But inside I'm raging

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.791
What's the use of talking
When nobody is listening?

01:17:35.875 --> 01:17:38.083
I love my mom
She means the world to me

01:17:38.166 --> 01:17:40.166
I just want her to be proud of me

01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:42.416
I'm losing myself, I need some help

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.291
'Cause I'm going down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

01:17:45.375 --> 01:17:48.375
Can you hear me?
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down

01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:49.666
Anybody listening?

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:52.458
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down

01:17:52.541 --> 01:17:54.083
Is anybody listening?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.333
Oh, my babies!

01:18:16.416 --> 01:18:17.916
Oh, come, my darling.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Oh, my baby.
Come, come, come. Come through.

01:18:21.083 --> 01:18:25.000
[sighs] When I called,
I was just hoping you'd come.

01:18:25.083 --> 01:18:28.708
-[Prishen] We can't say no to you, Aya.
-[Aya] Aw! It's lovely out here.

01:18:29.583 --> 01:18:32.625
Oh my! I got something for her.

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:35.666
[Jennifer speaking indistinctly]

01:18:39.083 --> 01:18:40.833
[Aya] You guys are packing already?

01:18:41.791 --> 01:18:42.875
[Jennifer sighs]

01:18:47.625 --> 01:18:51.500
[sighs] I can't believe
we're leaving under these circumstances.

01:18:52.875 --> 01:18:55.666
[Elvis] This is supposed to be
the happiest time for us.

01:18:56.208 --> 01:18:59.291
You know, we never even asked Jodi
what she wanted.

01:18:59.375 --> 01:19:01.000
Yeah, yeah, we didn't.

01:19:01.083 --> 01:19:02.458
And… and that's all on me

01:19:02.541 --> 01:19:06.166
because of my domineering
and always-in-control self.

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:07.458
That's what it is.

01:19:07.541 --> 01:19:08.625
[Elvis] Come on, Jen.

01:19:09.291 --> 01:19:10.791
[peaceful flute music playing]

01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:13.291
You know, when I really think
about it… [inhales]

01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:18.250
…Jodi's actually been taking care of me
all these years.

01:19:19.083 --> 01:19:22.833
I mean, you know
what a workaholic I've been, Elvis.

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:28.750
And Jodi's just been there
from the time she was a little girl.

01:19:29.833 --> 01:19:33.333
Bringing me tea, making me sandwiches,

01:19:33.958 --> 01:19:35.333
mothering me.

01:19:39.416 --> 01:19:41.250
She's gonna make a great mom.

01:19:41.958 --> 01:19:43.375
[Elvis] Of course, she will.

01:19:45.291 --> 01:19:47.750
[Jennifer] Yeah, I wish
I could have told her

01:19:47.833 --> 01:19:49.625
how proud I am of her.

01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:52.958
[Arya fussing]

01:19:53.833 --> 01:19:54.750
Come.

01:20:26.875 --> 01:20:27.958
[Jennifer sighs]

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.083
[Arya cooing]

01:20:44.958 --> 01:20:47.291
[Elvis] We've always wanted
what's best for you.

01:20:49.666 --> 01:20:53.458
But we've also realized
that only you know what's best for you.

01:20:57.583 --> 01:20:59.250
We're thinking of selling the business.

01:21:00.916 --> 01:21:03.708
And if you're okay with it,
we'll just go ahead.

01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:07.166
But if you choose to,

01:21:08.666 --> 01:21:09.750
it's yours.

01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:16.000
[shakily] Completely yours, darling.
No interferences at all.

01:21:16.916 --> 01:21:18.666
But it's your everything.

01:21:22.458 --> 01:21:23.500
No, it's not.

01:21:26.708 --> 01:21:29.291
[tearfully] You are our everything.

01:21:30.041 --> 01:21:33.333
[uplifting Indian classical music playing]

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:00.625
[mouthing] Thank you.

01:22:06.375 --> 01:22:07.458
[indistinct chatter]

01:22:07.541 --> 01:22:08.500
[Prishen] Hey!

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:12.541
-You guys organized a braai for us.
-[Aya] My darling!

01:22:14.041 --> 01:22:17.208
You know how our Jodi loved this
when she was younger.

01:22:17.291 --> 01:22:18.708
-Hey, sweetie.
-Thanks, Ma.

01:22:19.416 --> 01:22:21.666
Aw, look at our little baby.

01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:23.833
-[Prishen] It smells like home.
-Hey, boy.

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:25.625
There you go.

01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:27.958
Jodi, you're doing an amazing job.

01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:33.166
-Every woman knows how tough it is.
-True.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.416
Whilst everyone is confessing--

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:39.291
Hey, Aya, we all know
you're the laser tag queen.

01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:40.541
Anyway, that too.

01:22:40.625 --> 01:22:42.500
I was a little bit naughty.

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:49.250
I cooked up a scheme with Moothoo
and made a big profit from all of you all.

01:22:49.833 --> 01:22:50.833
From all of us?

01:22:50.916 --> 01:22:53.833
Yes, you, Prishen,
Jennifer, Shanthi, everyone.

01:22:53.916 --> 01:22:55.583
-Onetime.
-[all laugh]

01:22:55.666 --> 01:22:58.208
Aya, how much of money
did that fellow give you?

01:22:58.291 --> 01:23:00.166
I was the brains in the operation.

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:03.458
-His cut was 20%.
-[upbeat Indian percussion music playing]

01:23:04.041 --> 01:23:08.083
Aya, 80%? You took 80%,
and you gave him 20?

01:23:08.166 --> 01:23:10.583
Go big, or go home.
[in Mauritian Creole] Everything is good.

01:23:10.666 --> 01:23:12.125
Allez! Allez!

01:23:12.208 --> 01:23:14.291
-[Prishen] Oui! Oui!
-[all laughing]

01:23:14.375 --> 01:23:17.541
[in English] Wait, Ma.
What did you need the money for?

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:21.833
I wanted to buy a gold bangle
for my great-granddaughter.

01:23:24.125 --> 01:23:26.708
You know it's customary for us to buy.

01:23:28.875 --> 01:23:30.500
[chuckles softly]

01:23:30.583 --> 01:23:32.500
There you go, Ma. There you go.

01:23:33.666 --> 01:23:35.208
Aw.

01:23:35.916 --> 01:23:39.208
[indistinct chatter]

01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:41.000
She's getting as strong…

01:23:41.083 --> 01:23:44.666
-[Shanthi] Which way are you holding it?
-[Prishen] Turn it for a selfie.

01:23:45.375 --> 01:23:47.125
-Look.
-Look there.

01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:48.958
Watch her face.

01:23:49.041 --> 01:23:50.666
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:53.708
Everybody say "Arya!"

01:23:53.791 --> 01:23:55.166
-[all] Arya!
-[shutter clicks]

01:24:10.958 --> 01:24:12.916
[Shanthi] I'm so sorry for everything.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.166
[Desan] I love you, Ma.

01:24:17.875 --> 01:24:20.333
But only after a month.

01:24:20.916 --> 01:24:22.333
You are grounded.

01:24:23.041 --> 01:24:25.041
-No more bullying.
-Bullying.

01:24:25.125 --> 01:24:26.541
-No more…
-Bullying.

01:24:26.625 --> 01:24:29.041
-I'm sorry, Ma. No more bullying.
-[Preggie] Hmm.

01:24:29.125 --> 01:24:32.000
[Aya] Ah! That's parenting for you.

01:24:32.791 --> 01:24:37.083
You have to take it all,
the good, the bad, the ugly.

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.875
Nice to say.

01:24:39.958 --> 01:24:45.291
All in all,
it's the most beautiful, precious gift.

01:24:45.375 --> 01:24:47.791
[indistinct chatter]

01:24:49.458 --> 01:24:50.458
[Preggie] Son.

01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:53.416
Say "thatha."

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.333
Sound check, one, two.

01:24:56.083 --> 01:24:58.583
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats

01:24:58.666 --> 01:25:01.375
and welcome
to my niece's first birthday party.

01:25:01.458 --> 01:25:04.000
[guests applauding and cheering]

01:25:08.833 --> 01:25:10.000
[both sigh]

01:25:11.416 --> 01:25:13.083
Wow! What a year it's been!

01:25:13.583 --> 01:25:15.625
Becoming a parent is a beautiful thing.

01:25:16.333 --> 01:25:18.375
We often wonder how our parents did it.

01:25:18.458 --> 01:25:21.541
-I, too, wonder how your parents did it.
-[guests laugh]

01:25:21.625 --> 01:25:24.541
They somehow managed
and made all the sacrifices for us.

01:25:25.125 --> 01:25:30.041
And sometimes we forget,
or we don't acknowledge it enough,

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:33.625
but we know that there's no such thing
as a perfect parent.

01:25:33.708 --> 01:25:35.291
But every now and then…

01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:39.166
-Our parents come pretty close.
-They do.

01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:40.875
[guests applauding and cheering]

01:25:40.958 --> 01:25:42.125
[laughing] Lies!

01:25:42.208 --> 01:25:44.500
[uplifting Indian classical music playing]

01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:57.958
-[Aya] Ah, parenting!
-[guests cheering]

01:25:58.833 --> 01:26:01.958
[Aya] It fills your heart
with love and joy.

01:26:02.041 --> 01:26:03.916
-Let's go.
-[Aya] But why I must lie?

01:26:04.583 --> 01:26:06.708
Nothing can prepare you for it.

01:26:06.791 --> 01:26:07.958
[guests applauding]

01:26:08.041 --> 01:26:09.500
[Aya] There is no rule book,

01:26:10.125 --> 01:26:12.041
no perfect recipe.

01:26:13.083 --> 01:26:14.416
That's the problem.

01:26:15.416 --> 01:26:19.541
But just follow your instincts
and pray for the best.

01:26:21.916 --> 01:26:23.666
[Jodi and Prishen laughing]

01:26:24.583 --> 01:26:26.291
Grandmas of the year!

01:26:26.375 --> 01:26:28.750
-Best party ever.
-Absolutely.

01:26:28.833 --> 01:26:31.833
Elvis, Preggie,
show them what I taught you all.

01:26:33.708 --> 01:26:35.208
Wake up!

01:26:35.291 --> 01:26:37.000
[upbeat Bhangra-style song playing]

01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:38.125
Elvis.

01:26:40.125 --> 01:26:43.125
[man singing]

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:44.708
[Aya] Sometimes, there'll be good days
and bad days.

01:28:44.791 --> 01:28:48.041
Some days, we'll have no idea what to do.

01:28:48.125 --> 01:28:52.541
Sometimes, they'll give you
sleepless nights and heartaches.

01:28:52.625 --> 01:28:55.166
Some days, they'll love you,

01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:57.541
and other days, they'll hate you.

01:28:58.041 --> 01:28:59.416
But that's okay.

01:29:00.166 --> 01:29:02.041
Just keep doing your best.

01:29:02.125 --> 01:29:04.583
That's a top parent for you.

01:29:04.666 --> 01:29:05.750
[song fades out]

01:29:07.291 --> 01:29:09.291
[upbeat song playing]

01:29:16.125 --> 01:29:18.125
[man singing]

01:29:45.083 --> 01:29:48.666
My happiest moment was
when I was waving goodbye to them

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:49.833
at the airport.

01:29:50.458 --> 01:29:51.375
Except Aya.

01:29:51.458 --> 01:29:54.125
It's funny how she thinks
she's still the mastermind.

01:29:54.208 --> 01:29:57.458
I was the only one
seeing the envelopes before everybody.

01:29:57.541 --> 01:30:02.250
So I was choosing to give her her "80%."

01:30:02.333 --> 01:30:04.625
But shh. Don't tell anybody.

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:07.000
[in Mauritian Creole] Everything is good.

01:30:07.083 --> 01:30:09.083
[song continues]

01:30:27.208 --> 01:30:28.875
[in English] What happens after this?

01:30:28.958 --> 01:30:30.250
Who knows?

01:30:30.333 --> 01:30:32.458
Who knows
if the kids will come back to Durban?

01:30:32.541 --> 01:30:34.625
Who knows if they'll have another baby?

01:30:34.708 --> 01:30:37.625
Who knows
if some people will still be around?

01:30:39.125 --> 01:30:41.541
What goes around comes around.

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.125
Because karma is a…

01:30:45.166 --> 01:30:46.666
big witch.

01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:52.750
Who knows? We just have to wait and see.

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:56.458
[song ends]

01:30:58.416 --> 01:31:00.000
[peaceful music playing]

01:31:14.208 --> 01:31:16.208
[woman singing in traditional style]

01:32:41.041 --> 01:32:42.041
[song fades out]
