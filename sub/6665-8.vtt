00:00.499 --> 00:01.498
- Good evening.

00:01.499 --> 00:02.499
Right now, I'm on a rooftop

00:03.499 --> 00:05.498
in the heart of historic
downtown Los Angeles,

00:05.499 --> 00:07.498
overseeing
the final preparations

00:07.499 --> 00:08.498
for what could be

00:08.499 --> 00:10.499
one of the most
astonishing events

00:10.940 --> 00:13.498
to ever be broadcast
on television,

00:13.499 --> 00:16.498
an event that could change
a man's life forever.

00:16.499 --> 00:17.498
This is Corey,

00:17.499 --> 00:20.498
an ordinary guy whose
life is in a rut.

00:20.499 --> 00:22.498
But two weeks ago,

00:22.499 --> 00:25.498
I secretly took over
Corey's entire identity

00:25.499 --> 00:27.498
with one goal in mind:

00:27.499 --> 00:30.498
to transform
a totally unremarkable man

00:30.499 --> 00:32.497
into a national hero.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.498
How will I do it?

00:34.499 --> 00:36.498
Well, if everything
goes as planned,

00:36.499 --> 00:39.498
in just moments,
a crowd below

00:39.499 --> 00:43.498
will be inspired as Corey
steps off this rooftop

00:43.499 --> 00:46.499
and performs a death-defying
tightrope walk for charity.

00:47.499 --> 00:48.498
But what no one will know

00:48.499 --> 00:51.498
is that the man
who's really walking that wire

00:51.499 --> 00:52.498
will be me.

00:52.499 --> 00:54.498
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

00:54.499 --> 00:56.498
<i>I've always believed</i>
<i>that there's a hero</i>

00:56.499 --> 00:58.498
<i>inside each</i>
<i>and every one of us.</i>

00:58.499 --> 01:01.498
<i>So nine months ago,</i>
<i>to inspire you,</i>

01:01.499 --> 01:03.498
<i>I began working</i>
<i>on a secret project</i>

01:03.499 --> 01:05.498
<i>to prove that even</i>
<i>the most unlikely people</i>

01:05.498 --> 01:08.498
<i>have the potential</i>
<i>for greatness.</i>

01:08.499 --> 01:10.498
<i>Can anyone become a hero?</i>

01:10.499 --> 01:12.498
<i>Well, tonight,</i>
<i>you're about to find out.</i>

01:12.499 --> 01:14.499
<i>♪</i>

01:16.499 --> 01:19.498
<i>When I decided I wanted</i>
<i>to transform someone's life,</i>

01:19.499 --> 01:21.498
<i>I knew I needed</i>
<i>to find a person</i>

01:21.499 --> 01:23.498
<i>who was beyond hopeless.</i>

01:23.499 --> 01:24.498
<i>So I sent out</i>
<i>a team of producers</i>

01:24.499 --> 01:28.498
<i>to scour food courts,</i>
<i>coffee shops, gas stations,</i>

01:28.499 --> 01:30.498
<i>and comic book stores,</i>
<i>looking for people</i>

01:30.499 --> 01:32.498
<i>who wanted a better life.</i>

01:32.499 --> 01:34.498
<i>The producers told them</i>
<i>they were recruiting</i>

01:34.499 --> 01:36.499
<i>for a new reality show,</i>
<i>in which participants</i>

01:37.499 --> 01:38.498
<i>would receive a life makeover.</i>

01:38.499 --> 01:41.498
<i>And after an exhaustive</i>
<i>search that lasted weeks,</i>

01:41.499 --> 01:43.498
<i>someone finally caught my eye.</i>

01:43.499 --> 01:46.499
<i>- My name is</i>
<i>Corey Calderwood, and, uh...</i>

01:47.499 --> 01:50.498
<i>I work at an arcade</i>
<i>right now three days a week.</i>

01:50.499 --> 01:52.498
<i>- Corey was single,</i>
<i>stuck in a dead-end job,</i>

01:52.499 --> 01:54.498
<i>and lived with his parents.</i>

01:54.499 --> 01:56.499
<i>He didn't seem to have</i>
<i>any life plans whatsoever,</i>

01:57.180 --> 01:58.498
<i>so I paid him a visit</i>
<i>at his home</i>

01:58.499 --> 01:59.499
<i>in Ventura, California,</i>

02:00.499 --> 02:02.499
<i>with an offer to change</i>
<i>his life forever.</i>

02:03.499 --> 02:04.498
Are you happy
with where you're at

02:04.499 --> 02:05.499
in your life right now?

02:08.499 --> 02:10.497
- Uh...

02:10.499 --> 02:12.498
Most of the time,
I'd say I have those moments

02:12.499 --> 02:14.498
where you feel like
it could be better, you know?

02:14.499 --> 02:16.498
There's things
that I still want,

02:16.499 --> 02:17.498
I guess.

02:17.499 --> 02:19.498
<i>- Corey spends</i>
<i>most of his days</i>

02:19.499 --> 02:22.498
<i>caring for his parents' house</i>
<i>where he still lives,</i>

02:22.499 --> 02:23.498
<i>playing video games,</i>

02:23.499 --> 02:25.498
<i>and organizing</i>
<i>his collection of</i>

02:25.499 --> 02:26.498
<i>"Magic: The Gathering" cards.</i>

02:26.499 --> 02:29.498
- Just a fun little way
to pass some time.

02:29.499 --> 02:32.498
<i>- But since his mom and stepdad</i>
<i>are away in Hawaii</i>

02:32.499 --> 02:33.498
<i>on business most of the year,</i>

02:33.499 --> 02:36.498
<i>his grandparents have become</i>
<i>his main caregivers.</i>

02:36.499 --> 02:39.498
<i>And they, too, would like</i>
<i>to see more from Corey.</i>

02:39.499 --> 02:40.498
- He has a great
potential.

02:40.499 --> 02:44.498
He just doesn't
either know how to

02:44.499 --> 02:47.499
achieve it
or to get into it.

02:48.499 --> 02:49.498
<i>He just seems to be</i>

02:49.499 --> 02:51.498
gliding through
life right now.

02:51.499 --> 02:54.498
- Just slip-sliding away.
- Slip-sliding away.

02:54.499 --> 02:56.498
<i>- Corey was</i>
<i>the perfect candidate.</i>

02:56.499 --> 02:58.498
<i>But I had to make sure</i>
<i>he was willing</i>

02:58.499 --> 03:00.498
<i>to play by my rules.</i>

03:00.499 --> 03:01.498
I should tell you,
that you won't have

03:01.499 --> 03:04.498
much information
throughout this process.

03:04.499 --> 03:06.498
And once we get started,
you will be

03:06.499 --> 03:09.498
completely cut off
from the outside world.

03:09.499 --> 03:10.499
- All right.

03:11.499 --> 03:12.498
That is interesting.

03:12.499 --> 03:14.498
- But I can tell you
that if you do this,

03:14.499 --> 03:18.498
by the time I'm done,
you will reemerge

03:18.499 --> 03:21.498
as a national hero.

03:21.499 --> 03:22.498
So...

03:22.499 --> 03:23.499
Are you in?

03:26.499 --> 03:27.498
- Yeah.

03:27.499 --> 03:28.499
- You sure?

03:28.860 --> 03:30.498
- Sure.

03:30.499 --> 03:31.498
<i>- With Corey on board</i>

03:31.499 --> 03:33.499
<i>and a legal liability waiver</i>
<i>signed,</i>

03:34.499 --> 03:36.498
<i>I could now begin the process</i>
<i>of learning everything</i>

03:36.499 --> 03:39.498
<i>about him, as my plan</i>
<i>would soon require me</i>

03:39.499 --> 03:41.498
<i>to secretly take over</i>
<i>Corey's life.</i>

03:41.499 --> 03:43.498
- My stepdad travels
for his work.

03:43.499 --> 03:44.498
I definitely find braces

03:44.499 --> 03:46.498
to be really cute,
for some reason.

03:46.499 --> 03:48.498
I like alfredo pasta.

03:48.499 --> 03:49.498
And I worked at
a call center.

03:49.499 --> 03:51.498
I've worked at
a recycling factory.

03:51.499 --> 03:54.498
My favorite movie
of all time was "Tommy Boy."

03:54.499 --> 03:55.498
I just say "cool beans"
a lot.

03:55.499 --> 03:57.498
- Cool beans.
- Cool beans.

03:57.499 --> 04:00.498
<i>- But learning facts about</i>
<i>Corey wouldn't be enough,</i>

04:00.499 --> 04:03.498
<i>as my plan would require me</i>
<i>to physically become him.</i>

04:03.499 --> 04:05.498
<i>So I asked him to give me</i>
<i>a tour of his bedroom,</i>

04:05.499 --> 04:07.498
<i>with the real purpose</i>
<i>of secretly</i>

04:07.499 --> 04:09.499
<i>studying his mannerisms</i>
<i>and the way he moved.</i>

04:10.499 --> 04:11.498
- Well, normally,
I mean--

04:11.499 --> 04:12.499
I just go on for
a little bit.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.498
<i>- But to pull this off,</i>

04:14.499 --> 04:17.498
<i>my resemblance to Corey</i>
<i>would have to go further.</i>

04:17.499 --> 04:19.498
<i>So the next day, we told him</i>
<i>he'd have to take</i>

04:19.499 --> 04:22.498
<i>a routine physical</i>
<i>to make sure he was fit enough</i>

04:22.499 --> 04:23.498
<i>to participate in the show.</i>

04:23.499 --> 04:26.498
<i>But what Corey didn't know</i>
<i>is that the doctor</i>

04:26.499 --> 04:29.498
<i>was actually four-time</i>
<i>Emmy-nominated makeup artist</i>

04:29.499 --> 04:31.498
<i>Vincent Van Dyke,</i>
<i>who, in the guise of</i>

04:31.499 --> 04:34.498
<i>performing some</i>
<i>routine medical tests...</i>

04:34.499 --> 04:35.498
- So this is gonna just
test for epilepsy.

04:35.499 --> 04:37.499
I'm just gonna have you
close your eyes, okay?

04:38.499 --> 04:40.498
<i>- Was able to secure</i>
<i>our most crucial asset</i>

04:40.499 --> 04:42.498
<i>for my transformation:</i>

04:42.499 --> 04:45.498
<i>a full 3-D laser scan</i>
<i>of Corey's face.</i>

04:45.499 --> 04:47.499
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

04:48.499 --> 04:49.498
- All right,
thank you so much.

04:49.499 --> 04:51.498
I appreciate it.
- No problem.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.498
<i>- With his digitized</i>
<i>facial map on file,</i>

04:53.499 --> 04:55.498
<i>I had it sent</i>
<i>to a 3-D printer</i>

04:55.499 --> 04:57.498
<i>to create</i>
<i>a life-size replica bust.</i>

04:57.499 --> 05:00.499
<i>And once complete, it was</i>
<i>delivered to Vincent's studio</i>

05:01.499 --> 05:04.498
<i>in Burbank, where he began</i>
<i>the process of casting the mold</i>

05:04.499 --> 05:07.498
<i>for the latex prosthetic</i>
<i>that would turn me</i>

05:07.499 --> 05:08.499
<i>into Corey Calderwood.</i>

05:08.860 --> 05:10.498
<i>But for what</i>
<i>I was about to do next,</i>

05:10.499 --> 05:13.498
<i>I had to get</i>
<i>the real Corey out of town.</i>

05:13.499 --> 05:15.498
Just so you don't know
where you're going,

05:15.499 --> 05:17.498
I'm gonna put this bag
over your head.

05:17.499 --> 05:18.498
Is that okay?

05:18.499 --> 05:19.498
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:19.499 --> 05:22.498
- Okay.

05:22.499 --> 05:23.498
You can breathe okay?

05:23.499 --> 05:25.498
- Yeah.

05:25.499 --> 05:26.498
<i>- Once I assumed</i>
<i>his identity,</i>

05:26.499 --> 05:28.498
<i>there couldn't be two of us.</i>

05:28.499 --> 05:30.498
Okay, you comfortable?
- Yeah.

05:30.499 --> 05:32.498
<i>- So I needed to</i>
<i>completely isolate Corey</i>

05:32.499 --> 05:34.498
<i>from the rest of the world--</i>

05:34.499 --> 05:37.498
<i>away from phones, internet,</i>
<i>and especially his family.</i>

05:37.499 --> 05:39.498
The road ends here, okay?

05:39.499 --> 05:41.498

<i>- Walking a wire is one</i>

07:22.398 --> 07:24.397
<i>of the most inspiring acts</i>
<i>a human can do.</i>

07:24.398 --> 07:26.397
<i>So for the past seven months,</i>

07:26.398 --> 07:28.397
<i>I've been teaching myself</i>
<i>how to balance</i>

07:28.398 --> 07:30.839
<i>on a 1/2 inch</i>
<i>steel tightrope.</i>

07:31.398 --> 07:32.397
<i>When I first attempted this,</i>

07:32.398 --> 07:33.397

<i>stay on the wire</i>

07:42.398 --> 07:43.398
<i>And just a week</i>
<i>before meeting Corey,</i>

07:44.398 --> 07:46.397
<i>I was finally good enough</i>
<i>to make it across a wire</i>

07:46.398 --> 07:49.397
<i>suspended 5 feet</i>
<i>in the air.</i>

07:49.398 --> 07:51.397
<i>But to turn someone</i>
<i>into a national hero,</i>

07:51.398 --> 07:54.397
<i>I would need the spectacle</i>
<i>to be much bigger.</i>

07:54.398 --> 07:57.397
<i>So I picked a pair of buildings</i>
<i>in downtown Los Angeles</i>

07:57.398 --> 08:00.397
<i>to be the platform</i>
<i>for a death-defying wire walk</i>

08:00.398 --> 08:02.398
<i>80 feet above the ground.</i>

08:02.799 --> 08:04.397
<i>Now I just had to</i>
<i>convince the public</i>

08:04.398 --> 08:07.397
<i>that another man</i>
<i>would be doing it.</i>

08:07.398 --> 08:09.397
<i>So with Corey laying low</i>
<i>in the desert,</i>

08:09.398 --> 08:12.397

08:12.398 --> 08:15.279

<i>were ready,</i>

<i>my transformation</i>

08:24.398 --> 08:25.398

<i>to promote the big event.</i>

08:32.398 --> 08:35.397
<i>- 95.5, KLOS.</i>

08:35.398 --> 08:36.397
- So you're gonna get on a wire

08:36.398 --> 08:38.397

- This isn't what you do?

08:39.398 --> 08:43.397
- Just started learning
to wire walk six months ago.

08:43.398 --> 08:44.397
It's totally new for me.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.397
- I can't imagine you
being on a high wire

08:46.398 --> 08:48.397
with thousands,
possibly, of people--

08:48.398 --> 08:50.397
- A lot of people
have been saying that

08:50.398 --> 08:54.397
what I'm doing is inspiring
and heroic, you know?

08:54.398 --> 08:57.397
But I--I really don't
see it that way.

08:57.398 --> 09:01.397
My goal is to raise awareness
for breast cancer

09:01.398 --> 09:04.397
and the charity Metavivor,
specifically.

09:04.398 --> 09:05.398
- Well, then
you are a hero.

09:06.398 --> 09:07.397
- Yes!
- I hope you make it--

09:07.398 --> 09:08.397
- Well, I don't
see it that way.

09:08.398 --> 09:10.397
I don't really see
myself as a hero,

09:10.398 --> 09:12.398
but thank you for
saying that; that is nice.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.397
- Did breast cancer affect you
personally in some way?

09:15.398 --> 09:16.397
- No.

09:16.398 --> 09:17.397
<i>The radio appearance</i>

09:17.398 --> 09:18.397
<i>couldn't have gone better.</i>

09:18.398 --> 09:20.397
<i>And with millions</i>
<i>of people listening,</i>

09:20.398 --> 09:22.397
<i>I was hopeful</i>
<i>it would draw a crowd.</i>

09:22.398 --> 09:25.397
<i>But there was still</i>
<i>one issue I had to resolve.</i>

09:25.398 --> 09:26.397
<i>When I first met Corey,</i>

09:26.398 --> 09:28.397
<i>he opened up to me</i>
<i>about something</i>

09:28.398 --> 09:29.397
<i>he was struggling with.</i>

09:29.398 --> 09:31.397
- It would be good
to be in a relationship.

09:31.398 --> 09:34.397
It gets lonely when
you're not with someone

09:34.398 --> 09:35.397
for a while, you know.

09:35.398 --> 09:37.397
<i>- I was worried that</i>
<i>if his love life</i>

09:37.398 --> 09:40.397
<i>remained unfulfilled, he might</i>
<i>not have the confidence</i>

09:40.398 --> 09:43.397
<i>he would need to step into</i>
<i>his new role as a hero.</i>

09:43.398 --> 09:44.879
<i>So I decided to</i>
<i>create an online</i>

09:45.398 --> 09:47.397
<i>dating account for Corey</i>
<i>that I populated</i>

09:47.398 --> 09:49.397
<i>with photos</i>
<i>from his Facebook page.</i>

09:49.398 --> 09:52.397
<i>I also created some new images</i>
<i>that would help portray</i>

09:52.398 --> 09:54.397
<i>Corey as a sensitive guy</i>
<i>that women</i>

09:54.398 --> 09:56.397
<i>would be unable to resist.</i>

09:56.398 --> 09:59.397
<i>And shortly after uploading</i>
<i>them to his profile,</i>

09:59.398 --> 10:00.397
<i>it seemed to work,</i>

10:00.398 --> 10:02.397
<i>as by the next morning,</i>
<i>I had a response</i>

10:02.398 --> 10:04.397
<i>from a lovely woman</i>
<i>named Jasmine,</i>

10:04.398 --> 10:07.397
<i>who seemed like she might be</i>
<i>a good fit for Corey.</i>

10:07.398 --> 10:09.397
<i>And after telling her</i>
<i>that a camera crew</i>

10:09.398 --> 10:11.397
<i>was following me because</i>
<i>I was gonna be performing</i>

10:11.398 --> 10:13.397
<i>a death-defying wire walk,</i>

10:13.398 --> 10:15.397
<i>she instantly agreed</i>
<i>to go on a date,</i>

10:15.398 --> 10:17.397
<i>which I set</i>
<i>for the following night.</i>

10:17.398 --> 10:19.397
<i>My goal was to establish</i>
<i>a relationship</i>

10:19.398 --> 10:22.397
<i>that Corey would</i>
<i>ultimately take over.</i>

10:22.398 --> 10:24.397
<i>So I tried my best</i>
<i>to portray a realistic</i>

10:24.398 --> 10:28.397
<i>but charming version</i>
<i>of the man whose skin I was in.</i>

10:28.398 --> 10:30.397
I just spend most of
my time in Ventura.

10:30.398 --> 10:31.397
You know?

10:31.398 --> 10:34.397
- Really?
- Not the greatest place.

10:34.398 --> 10:37.397
But it's kind of hard
to talk about myself with

10:37.398 --> 10:38.398
a goddess sitting
right in front of me.

10:39.398 --> 10:40.397
- Oh, thank you.

10:40.398 --> 10:41.397
- Yeah, sorry.

10:41.398 --> 10:44.397
Is that a bit cheesy,
or...

10:44.398 --> 10:45.397
- No, it's actually
really sweet.

10:45.398 --> 10:46.679
Nobody's ever
called me that before.

10:47.398 --> 10:48.397
<i>- I was immediately</i>
<i>surprised at how well</i>

10:48.398 --> 10:50.397
<i>the date was going,</i>

10:50.398 --> 10:51.397
<i>as in these situations,</i>

10:51.398 --> 10:53.397
<i>I'm usually</i>
<i>a lot more nervous.</i>

10:53.398 --> 10:55.397
- Back in high school, I was
actually on the debate team.

10:55.398 --> 10:56.398
- Wow.
- Yep.

10:57.079 --> 10:58.398
- So what's it like
to debate with you, then?

10:59.398 --> 11:00.397
- Um, I'm pretty good.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.397
- I bet you're
a pretty good arguer.

11:01.398 --> 11:03.397
- Yeah, I'm pretty good
at debating.

11:03.398 --> 11:05.397
- Should we try to
debate something now?

11:05.398 --> 11:06.397
Or--
I don't know.

11:06.398 --> 11:07.397
Just a silly joke.

11:07.398 --> 11:09.397
We don't
have to do that.

11:09.398 --> 11:11.397
<i>And ten minutes in,</i>
<i>not only were</i>

11:11.398 --> 11:12.398
<i>Corey and Jasmine</i>
<i>hitting it off...</i>

11:13.398 --> 11:14.397
- So have you
actually tried

11:14.398 --> 11:15.519
walking across
a building yet?

11:16.398 --> 11:17.397
- No.
- Wow.

11:17.398 --> 11:19.397
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be nerve-racking.

11:19.398 --> 11:21.397
<i>- They also had</i>
<i>a lot in common.</i>

11:21.398 --> 11:23.397
- Do you play "Sims" at all?

11:23.398 --> 11:24.397
- I do, yes.
- Yeah, so do I.

11:24.398 --> 11:25.919
It's my go-to pleasure.

11:26.398 --> 11:27.397
- Oh, yes.

11:27.398 --> 11:29.397
It's a guilty
pleasure for me.

11:29.398 --> 11:31.397
I love "Sims."
- Yeah.

11:31.398 --> 11:33.397
- Cool beans.

11:33.398 --> 11:35.397
- I like that expression.

11:35.398 --> 11:37.397
<i>- After a fun night</i>
<i>of conversation,</i>

11:37.398 --> 11:38.398
<i>it was time</i>
<i>to wrap things up.</i>

11:39.398 --> 11:41.397
<i>But before leaving, I wanted</i>
<i>to make it clear to Jasmine</i>

11:41.398 --> 11:44.397
<i>just how serious about her</i>
<i>Corey was.</i>

11:44.398 --> 11:47.397
- I hope it's not
too forward to ask,

11:47.398 --> 11:49.397
but, uh...

11:49.398 --> 11:53.397
Can I ask your
permission to kiss you?

11:53.398 --> 11:54.397
- Oh, sure.

11:54.398 --> 11:55.398
<i>- But it wasn't</i>
<i>gonna happen now,</i>

11:56.398 --> 11:59.397
<i>because I told her I wanted</i>
<i>our first kiss to be special.</i>

11:59.398 --> 12:00.397
I was thinking
we can do it

12:00.398 --> 12:02.398
right when I step off
that wire.

12:03.398 --> 12:05.397
- That'd be cool.
- Yeah.

12:05.398 --> 12:06.397
[chuckling]
Okay.

12:06.398 --> 12:08.398
<i>With Jasmine</i>
<i>consenting to a kiss,</i>

12:09.279 --> 12:11.397
<i>I was one step closer</i>
<i>to getting Corey</i>

12:11.398 --> 12:12.398
<i>a real relationship.</i>

12:13.398 --> 12:14.397
<i>But after she left,</i>
<i>I found myself</i>

12:14.398 --> 12:17.397
<i>strangely surprised</i>
<i>by my own confidence.</i>

12:17.398 --> 12:20.397
<i>There was something about being</i>
<i>in another person's skin</i>

12:20.398 --> 12:23.397
<i>that made all</i>
<i>my social anxiety vanish.</i>

12:23.398 --> 12:25.639
<i>And I didn't feel ready</i>
<i>to call it a night just yet.</i>

12:26.398 --> 12:27.397
- My friend Maureen
is from Boston.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.397
- Boston?

12:29.398 --> 12:30.397
[Boston accent
Oh, hi, I'm from Boston.

12:30.398 --> 12:32.397
I love Ben Affleck.

12:32.398 --> 12:33.397
[laughter]

12:33.398 --> 12:35.397
<i>I was able to charm</i>
<i>complete strangers.</i>

12:35.398 --> 12:37.397
<i>It was a side of me</i>
<i>I had never seen before.</i>

12:37.398 --> 12:39.397
- Thank you, bother.
- Yeah, of course, anytime.

12:39.398 --> 12:40.397
- What's your name?

12:40.398 --> 12:41.397
- Corey.

12:41.398 --> 12:42.398
Do you guys like dancing?

12:43.398 --> 12:44.397
<i>It was nice, for once,</i>
<i>to have a night away</i>

12:44.398 --> 12:46.397
<i>from all my insecurities.</i>

12:46.398 --> 12:48.397
<i>And as it came to an end,</i>

12:48.398 --> 12:50.397
<i>I actually felt a bit sad,</i>

12:50.398 --> 12:54.398
<i>knowing that I'd soon</i>
<i>have to go back to being me.</i>

12:55.398 --> 12:58.397
<i>With the day of the wire walk</i>
<i>fast approaching,</i>

12:58.398 --> 13:00.397
<i>I had Corey's grandparents</i>
<i>brought to Los Angeles</i>

13:00.398 --> 13:02.397
<i>to witness the big event.</i>

13:02.398 --> 13:04.397
<i>So far, they had</i>
<i>been kept completely</i>

13:04.398 --> 13:06.397
<i>in the dark about everything.</i>

13:06.398 --> 13:07.397
<i>But shortly after</i>
<i>their arrival,</i>

13:07.398 --> 13:09.397
<i>I began receiving</i>
<i>some troubling messages</i>

13:09.398 --> 13:11.397
<i>on Corey's phone.</i>

13:11.398 --> 13:13.397
<i>- We haven't heard from you</i>
<i>in a few days, honey.</i>

13:13.398 --> 13:14.397
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

13:14.398 --> 13:15.398
<i>We're getting concerned.</i>

13:16.398 --> 13:17.397
<i>- His grandparents</i>
<i>had found out</i>

13:17.398 --> 13:18.397
<i>about the wire walk</i>
<i>from one of the</i>

13:18.398 --> 13:20.397
<i>newspaper ads</i>
<i>we were running</i>

13:20.398 --> 13:22.397
<i>and became so concerned</i>
<i>that they insisted</i>

13:22.398 --> 13:24.397
<i>on seeing their grandson</i>
<i>in person.</i>

13:24.398 --> 13:26.397
<i>This was a big problem.</i>

13:26.398 --> 13:29.397
<i>I knew my Corey disguise</i>
<i>and impression were good,</i>

13:29.398 --> 13:30.397
<i>but to fool his own family</i>

13:30.398 --> 13:32.397
<i>would take some</i>
<i>additional effort.</i>

13:32.398 --> 13:35.397
<i>So I sent our sound guy</i>
<i>out to the Mojave Desert</i>

13:35.398 --> 13:37.839
<i>and had him record Corey</i>
<i>saying a specific</i>

13:38.398 --> 13:40.397
<i>series of phrases</i>
<i>that I had written.</i>

13:40.398 --> 13:42.397
- Yeah, sure.
Don't worry.

13:42.398 --> 13:44.397
Everything's
going to be okay.

13:44.398 --> 13:46.397
<i>- Corey had no idea</i>
<i>why we needed this,</i>

13:46.398 --> 13:48.397
<i>but I was able to use</i>
<i>these audio clips</i>

13:48.398 --> 13:51.397
<i>to create a digital soundboard</i>
<i>that would allow me</i>

13:51.398 --> 13:54.397
<i>to have any conversation</i>
<i>I wanted in his actual voice.</i>

13:54.398 --> 13:56.397
<i>- I agree.</i>

13:56.398 --> 13:57.398
<i>- I then arranged</i>
<i>to meet Corey's grandparents</i>

13:58.398 --> 13:59.397
<i>at their hotel.</i>

13:59.398 --> 14:01.397
<i>But since I didn't want them</i>
<i>to see me up close,</i>

14:01.398 --> 14:04.397
<i>I hired an actress</i>
<i>to pose as a hotel manager</i>

14:04.398 --> 14:07.397
<i>and inform them that no one</i>
<i>was allowed in or out.</i>

14:07.398 --> 14:09.397
- We just have a suspicious man
on the loose.

14:09.398 --> 14:10.397
We're checking it out
right now.

14:10.398 --> 14:12.397
So please just stay
in your room.

14:12.398 --> 14:14.397
<i>- Then I texted them</i>
<i>from across the street,</i>

14:14.398 --> 14:16.397
<i>telling them to go out</i>
<i>on their balcony.</i>

14:16.398 --> 14:19.397
<i>Now I just had to pray</i>
<i>that this would work.</i>

14:19.398 --> 14:20.397
<i>- Hi, Grandma.</i>

14:20.398 --> 14:21.397
<i>Hi, Grandpa.</i>

14:21.398 --> 14:22.397
- Corey!
- There he is!

14:22.398 --> 14:23.397
- Hi!
- Hey, Corey!

14:23.398 --> 14:25.397
<i>- It's so great</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

14:25.398 --> 14:27.397
- It's great to see you.
- It's good to be here.

14:27.398 --> 14:29.397
<i>- The hotel was</i>
<i>all blocked in.</i>

14:29.398 --> 14:30.397
<i>They won't let</i>
<i>me inside.</i>

14:30.398 --> 14:32.398
<i>We'll have to</i>
<i>talk like this.</i>

14:32.399 --> 14:35.397
- You okay?

14:35.398 --> 14:36.397
<i>- Yes.</i>

14:36.398 --> 14:38.397
<i>Just don't worry</i>
<i>about me.</i>

14:38.398 --> 14:39.397
<i>I've been</i>
<i>training hard,</i>

14:39.398 --> 14:41.397
<i>and I'll be</i>
<i>totally safe.</i>

14:41.398 --> 14:43.397
- You better be!

14:43.398 --> 14:44.398
<i>- Yes.</i>

14:45.398 --> 14:46.397
<i>I need to go now.</i>

14:46.398 --> 14:47.397
- Okay.

14:47.398 --> 14:48.397
<i>- But just know I'm safe</i>

14:48.398 --> 14:49.397
<i>and feeling great.</i>

14:49.398 --> 14:51.397
<i>I'll see you both</i>
<i>at the big event.</i>

14:51.398 --> 14:53.397
- We love you!

14:53.398 --> 14:54.397
- Love you, Corey.

14:54.398 --> 14:56.319
<i>- Yes.</i>

14:56.398 --> 14:57.359
- Bye!

14:57.398 --> 14:58.397
<i>- It worked like a charm.</i>

14:58.398 --> 15:01.397
<i>And Corey's grandparents</i>
<i>didn't suspect a thing.</i>

15:01.398 --> 15:02.397
- Is he in that van
over there?

15:02.398 --> 15:03.397
<i>I can't tell.</i>

15:03.398 --> 15:04.397
<i>- I think so.</i>

15:04.398 --> 15:06.397
<i>- And once we were</i>
<i>out of sight,</i>

15:06.398 --> 15:08.397
<i>I had the fake manager</i>
<i>defuse the situation.</i>

15:08.398 --> 15:10.397
- The gunman has
been killed.

15:10.398 --> 15:12.397
And you are free now

15:12.398 --> 15:14.397
to go around the hotel
as freely as you'd like--

15:14.398 --> 15:17.397
- He--someone was killed
in the hotel?

15:17.398 --> 15:19.398
<i>- With Corey's grandparents</i>
<i>put at ease,</i>

15:19.919 --> 15:21.397
<i>I could now refocus</i>
<i>on getting in</i>

15:21.398 --> 15:23.397
<i>some last-minute practice,</i>

15:23.398 --> 15:24.397
<i>working privately with</i>

15:24.398 --> 15:26.398
<i>aerial arts expert</i>
<i>Richie Gaona.</i>

15:27.398 --> 15:29.397
<i>But what I didn't expect</i>
<i>was the psychological shock</i>

15:29.398 --> 15:31.397
<i>to my system</i>
<i>when we increased the height</i>

15:31.398 --> 15:33.397
<i>of my training wire.</i>

15:33.398 --> 15:36.397
<i>My brain just wouldn't allow me</i>
<i>to take a single step.</i>

15:36.398 --> 15:38.397
<i>And I became seriously</i>
<i>concerned that</i>

15:38.398 --> 15:39.399
<i>once I was up</i>
<i>on that rooftop,</i>

15:40.398 --> 15:42.397
<i>my body might</i>
<i>completely shut down.</i>

15:42.398 --> 15:44.397
<i>But with my team</i>
<i>already under way</i>

15:44.398 --> 15:46.397
<i>constructing the rigging</i>
<i>for the wire walk,</i>

15:46.398 --> 15:47.398
<i>there was no turning back now.</i>

15:49.447 --> 15:51.446
<i>- The day had finally arrived</i>

15:51.447 --> 15:53.446
<i>for Corey to be transformed</i>
<i>into a hero</i>

15:53.447 --> 15:55.446
<i>in front of the eyes</i>
<i>of the nation.</i>

15:55.447 --> 15:57.446
<i>So early that morning,</i>
<i>I sent my crew</i>

15:57.447 --> 15:59.446
<i>to retrieve him</i>
<i>from the desert...</i>

15:59.447 --> 16:00.446
- Come with us.

16:00.447 --> 16:03.446
<i>- And covertly transport him</i>
<i>into the city.</i>

16:03.447 --> 16:05.446
<i>Meanwhile, on the rooftop,</i>

16:05.447 --> 16:08.447
<i>a team of experts rigged</i>
<i>a 3/4 inch steel wire</i>

16:09.288 --> 16:11.446
<i>that would be my only support</i>
<i>as I attempted to walk</i>

16:11.447 --> 16:14.446
<i>across the terrifying</i>
<i>80-foot drop.</i>

16:14.447 --> 16:17.446
<i>And with the final preparations</i>
<i>under way,</i>

16:17.447 --> 16:20.446
<i>news outlets were already</i>
<i>arriving on site,</i>

16:20.447 --> 16:23.446
<i>And a crowd of spectators</i>
<i>began to gather below.</i>

16:23.447 --> 16:27.446
<i>My plan was to cross from</i>
<i>the north to south rooftop,</i>

16:27.447 --> 16:29.446
<i>where a secret switch</i>
<i>would take place,</i>

16:29.447 --> 16:33.446
<i>and the real Corey would emerge</i>
<i>for his kiss with Jasmine.</i>

16:33.447 --> 16:36.446
<i>It had been a week since</i>
<i>she last saw me up close,</i>

16:36.447 --> 16:38.446
<i>so my hope was that</i>
<i>once I switched with Corey,</i>

16:38.447 --> 16:40.446
<i>any minor discrepancies</i>
<i>in our appearance</i>

16:40.447 --> 16:42.446
<i>would go unnoticed.</i>

16:42.447 --> 16:45.446
<i>So with Jasmine now in position</i>
<i>on the rooftop</i>

16:45.447 --> 16:47.447
<i>and Corey's grandparents</i>
<i>looking on below,</i>

16:48.447 --> 16:49.446
<i>I had Corey brought</i>
<i>from the van</i>

16:49.447 --> 16:52.446
<i>into a holding area</i>
<i>downstairs.</i>

16:52.447 --> 16:54.448
<i>And once he was changed into</i>
<i>his wire walking suite,</i>

16:55.447 --> 16:57.446
<i>it was time to bring him</i>
<i>up to speed.</i>

16:57.447 --> 16:59.447
Take off your hood.

17:03.447 --> 17:04.446
- Hey.

17:05.446 --> 17:06.445
- Hey.

17:06.446 --> 17:08.445

17:08.446 --> 17:09.445
- Uh...
I'm doing good.

17:09.446 --> 17:11.088

17:11.446 --> 17:12.445

17:12.446 --> 17:14.445

17:14.446 --> 17:15.446
- Yeah.

17:16.446 --> 17:18.445

17:18.446 --> 17:19.445
I could kind of
recognize your voice

17:19.446 --> 17:21.445

17:21.446 --> 17:22.445
<i>- Time was of the essence.</i>

17:22.446 --> 17:24.445
<i>So I quickly explained</i>
<i>to Corey my plan</i>

17:24.446 --> 17:26.445
<i>for the big wire walk event.</i>

17:26.446 --> 17:28.445
- So that's what
we're gonna do right now,

17:28.446 --> 17:30.446
is, we're--
you're gonna do that,

17:30.447 --> 17:32.446

it's me who did it?

17:32.447 --> 17:33.446
- Yes.

17:33.447 --> 17:37.446
Corey, are you ready
to be a hero?

17:37.447 --> 17:40.446
- Uh...

17:40.447 --> 17:41.446
I guess we have it
all set up,

17:41.447 --> 17:45.128

got to do it now.

17:45.447 --> 17:46.446

17:46.447 --> 17:48.447
<i>- With Corey on board,</i>
<i>I updated him on everything</i>

17:51.447 --> 17:52.446
This is your

17:52.447 --> 17:53.446
Jasmine.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.446
She's already consented
to kissing you.

17:56.447 --> 17:57.446
Okay?
- Okay.

17:57.447 --> 17:59.446

using too much tongue.

17:59.447 --> 18:00.446

18:00.447 --> 18:01.446

18:10.447 --> 18:12.446

18:12.447 --> 18:15.008
<i>- I told Corey that after</i>
<i>his kiss with Jasmine,</i>

18:15.447 --> 18:17.088
<i>he would deliver</i>
<i>a pre-written speech</i>

18:17.447 --> 18:19.446
