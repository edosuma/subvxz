Children, your gym teacher, Ms. Pommelhorst, 
has a brief announcement.

00:38.845 --> 00:40.517
This is very emotional for me.

00:40.584 --> 00:42.220
I'm taking a leave of absence.

00:42.465 --> 00:46.807
I will return in the fall as Mr. Pommelhorst, 
your new shop teacher.

00:46.863 --> 00:50.539
We're telling you children now, so you
can adjust and not make jokes.

00:50.613 --> 00:53.318
Looks like there'll be some 
new wood in shop class!

00:53.395 --> 00:56.097
Precisely the type of wordplay 
I seek to discourage.

00:57.427 --> 00:58.300
New wood.

00:58.374 --> 01:00.381
Now, please welcome your new gym teacher:

01:00.435 --> 01:01.392
Coach Krupt.

01:01.392 --> 01:05.007
Today, we're going to play a game 
that's as old as pain itself:

01:05.257 --> 01:06.474
Bombardment.

01:06.528 --> 01:09.058
I'm intrigued. What are the rules?

01:09.287 --> 01:10.373
Duck or die!

01:13.798 --> 01:15.642
Bombardment, deal with it.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.723
Bombardment, life's a bitch, son.

01:17.767 --> 01:18.643
Bombardment!

01:18.665 --> 01:19.413
Bombardment!

01:19.707 --> 01:20.393
Walk it off.

01:20.485 --> 01:22.101
Bombardment! Bombardment!

01:25.188 --> 01:26.263
I caught it, I'm safe!

01:28.706 --> 01:29.850
Son, are you okay?

01:29.938 --> 01:31.140
I guess.

01:31.367 --> 01:32.442
Bombardment!

01:38.887 --> 01:43.551
Sweetie, if someone's bullying you, 
you should tell your teacher.

01:43.585 --> 01:45.672
But it's the teacher who's bullying me.

01:45.755 --> 01:47.601
Well, tell your regular bully.

01:47.626 --> 01:48.961
He won't like it one bit.

01:49.188 --> 01:54.532
Marge, I ripped my pants, the only pants 
that understand my complex heinie.

01:54.558 --> 01:56.331
That was your last pair.

01:56.485 --> 01:57.803
How did it happen?

01:58.746 --> 02:00.400
Normal wear and tear.

02:04.397 --> 02:05.291
My ass!

02:05.337 --> 02:07.441
Sir, your go-cart's damaged!

02:07.858 --> 02:11.002
I paid for 50 laps, and I'm 
going to take them!

02:18.447 --> 02:20.771
I'll have to go to every store 
in the pants district

02:20.847 --> 02:22.193
to find another pair like these.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.291
Homie.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.182
Kiss rubber, loser!

02:45.258 --> 02:47.750
You cry like a little girl, Amy.

02:48.746 --> 02:51.161
Come on now; those were just baby teeth.

02:52.096 --> 02:54.571
How much longer can this go on?

03:06.205 --> 03:07.470
I see you like reading.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.831
How do you like bombardment?

03:08.925 --> 03:09.463
Bombardment!

03:10.016 --> 03:10.912
Bombardment!

03:11.775 --> 03:14.591
"Bombardment! Bombardment! 
How do you like bombardment?"

03:14.686 --> 03:16.133
I'll show him.

03:22.606 --> 03:25.822
Time for the bombarded 
to become the bombardier.

03:30.088 --> 03:31.530
Why did I put this in here?

03:31.586 --> 03:33.013
My saxophone!

03:37.488 --> 03:38.980
Yeah, that's why.

03:39.005 --> 03:40.251
You're a jerk!

03:40.445 --> 03:42.211
I'm telling mom.

03:43.786 --> 03:44.511
Van Houten.

03:44.566 --> 03:45.420
Here, sir.

03:45.577 --> 03:48.811
But my doctor says no more bombardment.

03:48.878 --> 03:50.662
Well, here's a second opinion.

03:51.426 --> 03:51.972
Muntz.

03:52.048 --> 03:54.463
Do your worst; I'm drunk.

03:54.647 --> 03:57.862
Well, welcome to A.A.: Always attacking.

03:58.847 --> 03:59.442
Simpson.

04:00.555 --> 04:01.193
Simpson!

04:01.275 --> 04:02.943
Here.

04:05.218 --> 04:07.002
Bart's got an ice ball.

04:08.718 --> 04:10.792
What is your major malfunction, Simpson?

04:10.977 --> 04:14.453
You will defrost, drain, and surrender that ball.

04:14.517 --> 04:16.551
And I will use it to bombard you.

04:16.665 --> 04:17.553
Bombardment!

04:18.045 --> 04:19.290
Kid power!

04:30.397 --> 04:32.500
Me shack, it's ruined!

04:32.575 --> 04:35.013
You red rubber home wrecker!

04:42.098 --> 04:45.432
Listen, I'm real sorry I busted your shack.

04:45.595 --> 04:46.781
Let me make it up to you.

04:46.967 --> 04:49.341
I know a ravine where there's a rusted-out car.

04:49.416 --> 04:54.543
Don't be tantalizing me with tales 
of ravines and rusted-out cars.

04:54.668 --> 04:56.682
I'll only be getting me heart broke.

04:57.708 --> 04:58.562
That's my mom.

04:58.638 --> 04:59.411
I got to go.

04:59.495 --> 05:00.811
I finished nailing this board.

05:01.027 --> 05:02.633
Yeah, you're out of nails.

05:12.086 --> 05:13.241
Poor Willie.

05:13.768 --> 05:15.990
Would you like to spend the night with us?

05:16.058 --> 05:20.662
I don't need your charity, not as 
long as I've got a pan over me head.

05:20.775 --> 05:23.432
That's not a pan, it's a colander.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.302
Aw, so that's where all my soup went.

05:30.296 --> 05:32.292
Thanks for taking me in, missus.

05:32.345 --> 05:34.500
Please accept this in return.

05:34.598 --> 05:36.522
It's me most prized possession.

05:36.656 --> 05:40.783
It's a sculpture made of 
children's lost retainers.

05:42.928 --> 05:44.633
It's lovely.

05:44.796 --> 05:47.401
I like this part in here, the way it,

05:48.085 --> 05:49.291
it goes.

05:54.935 --> 05:57.210
willie, I hope I'm not being too personal,

05:57.268 --> 06:00.260
but you seem resigned to a 
life of abject squalor.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.371
My family is used to it.

06:02.456 --> 06:05.512
Me grandfather used to get 
sent down into the mines

06:05.628 --> 06:08.240
to make sure it was safe for the canaries.

06:08.586 --> 06:10.730
Don't you ever hope for anything better?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.380
Something better?

06:12.866 --> 06:13.990
For Willie?

06:15.347 --> 06:19.020
+ All I want is a place somewhere....

06:22.208 --> 06:22.980
And?

06:23.077 --> 06:23.901
That's it.

06:24.447 --> 06:26.472
Maybe you could aim a little higher.

06:26.625 --> 06:27.740
Well, let's see...

06:28.927 --> 06:35.180
+ To have me shack rebuilt get my rotten teeth

06:35.215 --> 06:40.122
+ all drill't something on underneath me kilt

06:40.158 --> 06:43.582
+ wouldn't it be adequate?

06:44.178 --> 06:52.053
+ Matching shoes for both me 
feet dining on untainted meat

06:52.645 --> 06:55.823
+ a toilet what still has its seat

06:55.895 --> 06:59.111
+ wouldn't it be adequate?

06:59.777 --> 07:00.961
+ Adequate

07:02.187 --> 07:03.051
+ adequate

07:04.226 --> 07:10.552
+ Wouldn't it be adequate?

07:13.107 --> 07:14.143
You're right, Lisa.

07:14.248 --> 07:18.171
I do want to better me lot, 
to live like a normal...

07:18.216 --> 07:19.091
that's great.

07:19.108 --> 07:19.802
Good night.

07:20.846 --> 07:25.142
Bart, willie could have a better life, 
if only someone showed him how.

07:26.096 --> 07:29.750
I bet I could turn him into a proper gentleman.

07:29.965 --> 07:33.513
And I will do it in time for the school science fair.

07:33.677 --> 07:34.710
You're on, Lis.

07:34.815 --> 07:38.771
I think you'll find that, deep down, 
anyone can be civilized.

07:40.436 --> 07:41.520
Good night, Willie.

07:41.627 --> 07:42.813
Good night.

07:51.687 --> 07:53.593
Willie, in the next few weeks I'll be teaching

07:53.598 --> 07:56.242
you poise, pronunciation and posture.

07:56.418 --> 07:58.760
Let's see you stand up as straight as you can.

07:58.866 --> 08:01.442
Well, there's a first time for everything.

08:04.987 --> 08:06.613
I'm too far off the ground!

08:06.937 --> 08:09.861
Lisa, come up here and help me down!

08:13.095 --> 08:14.532
So, how'm I doin'?

08:20.905 --> 08:24.182
Mr. Simpson, i appreciate how much 
you love our big blue trousers,

08:24.186 --> 08:26.693
but I'm afraid we just don't make them anymore.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.963
Sales plummeted after our disastrous super bowl ad.

08:30.426 --> 08:31.921
Big blue pants.

08:32.035 --> 08:35.261
When you no longer care if you're attractive to women.

08:55.387 --> 08:58.921
Mr. Stern, would you make those glorious blue pants

08:58.925 --> 09:01.181
again if I whipped up public interest for them?

09:01.335 --> 09:02.701
Of course, but how?

09:02.838 --> 09:05.263
Through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting,

09:05.266 --> 09:06.840
I haven't even thought of it yet!

09:07.112 --> 09:08.478
Well, what have I got to lose...

09:08.638 --> 09:11.744
besides the factory that's been in my family for generations?

09:14.508 --> 09:16.238
How long is this commercial, anyway?

09:16.365 --> 09:17.402
I don't know, I've...

09:17.445 --> 09:18.562
never made it to the end.

09:22.427 --> 09:25.443
OK, how do you address an archbishop?

09:27.288 --> 09:28.143
I'll kill ya!

09:28.237 --> 09:30.491
I'll kill ya for what ya done to me!

09:32.558 --> 09:36.251
Lisa, you're a sweet lass, but it's hopeless.

09:36.446 --> 09:37.901
Like me dad told me...

09:38.726 --> 09:40.182
you'll never amount to anything!

09:40.348 --> 09:44.250
You were born trash, and you'll be lucky if you grow up to be garbage!

09:47.488 --> 09:48.832
Would you like to cut the cord?

09:48.876 --> 09:52.442
Let him cut it himself, it's time he learned life ain't one big party!

09:53.507 --> 09:56.493
That was the last time we really talked.

09:58.827 --> 10:00.573
what the hell are they doing in there?

10:00.728 --> 10:03.921
Lisa bet Bart she can turn Willie into a proper gentleman.

10:04.587 --> 10:08.683
That's as unlikely as Kearney going around the world in 80 days.

10:08.868 --> 10:10.302
Eighty days...

10:10.436 --> 10:13.491
ample time to circum navigate the globe, booger breath.

10:13.618 --> 10:15.660
You, sir, have a wager!

10:15.795 --> 10:17.330
I shall hold the money!

10:21.918 --> 10:23.620
To istanbul!

10:23.735 --> 10:25.460
Wrong way, dingus!

10:32.648 --> 10:34.280
Homie, what's that?

10:35.066 --> 10:36.413
On the back of your head.

10:36.616 --> 10:38.761
It's called "headvertising."

10:38.865 --> 10:42.431
It creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.503
Well, it creeps me out.

10:45.115 --> 10:48.093
Wow... it glows in the dark.

10:48.228 --> 10:49.362
It's not supposed to.

10:54.347 --> 10:56.262
All right, let's just try one more lesson.

10:56.456 --> 10:57.442
Repeat after me:

10:57.615 --> 11:00.861
"What flows from the nose does not go on the clothes."

11:01.397 --> 11:05.081
What flows from me nose...

11:07.646 --> 11:08.973
It's no use!

11:09.166 --> 11:12.941
I'm not very cultured. I don't even have a last name!

11:13.657 --> 11:15.011
Care to concede that bet?

11:15.435 --> 11:16.081
No.

11:16.195 --> 11:18.052
Come on, willie, I believe in you.

11:21.516 --> 11:28.640
What flows from the nose does not go on my clothes.

11:28.786 --> 11:29.742
Say it again!

11:33.128 --> 11:37.810
+ What flows from the nose does not go on my clothes.

11:38.276 --> 11:41.271
+ I think he's got it yes, he's got it

11:41.886 --> 11:46.631
+ what flows from the nose does not go on my clothes

11:47.458 --> 11:48.622
a talking mirror!

11:50.736 --> 11:53.470
+ Where is that ghastly flow?

11:53.558 --> 11:54.890
+ The nose

11:55.266 --> 11:56.473
+ the nose!

11:56.747 --> 11:59.641
+ And where should it not go?

12:00.047 --> 12:02.682
+ Blue pants, blue pants!

12:02.957 --> 12:03.583
Dad!

12:03.588 --> 12:04.892
Get your own song.

12:05.067 --> 12:05.531
Fine.

12:06.057 --> 12:09.303
I'm getting blue pants in the morning

12:09.875 --> 12:12.491
ding dong, the zipper's gonna shine...

12:12.966 --> 12:14.411
Gee, Homer, if those blue pants

12:14.418 --> 12:15.402
mean that much to you,

12:15.538 --> 12:16.782
they must be the greatest.

12:16.906 --> 12:18.252
I'm getting two pair today!

12:18.386 --> 12:19.332
I don't get this.

12:19.356 --> 12:20.850
This guy paints his noggin,

12:20.915 --> 12:22.692
and you guys are ready to buy pants.

12:22.796 --> 12:25.102
Meanwhile, I been paying for that billboard outside

12:25.107 --> 12:27.382
for a year now, and it's not yieldin' nothin'!

12:28.078 --> 12:29.271
You don't have to look at me.

12:30.608 --> 12:31.833
You don't have to look at me.

12:32.976 --> 12:35.972
Well, he does have billboard money.

12:36.666 --> 12:38.312
Talking billboard money.

12:42.625 --> 12:44.771
But he might be right for my friend.

12:53.727 --> 12:58.091
Behold, the first machine that accurately measures surprise!

12:58.186 --> 12:58.732
Really?

13:02.276 --> 13:03.860
Miss Lisa Simpson.

13:04.326 --> 13:06.052
Master Bart Simpson.

13:08.718 --> 13:12.702
And mister G. K. Willington, esquire.

13:17.356 --> 13:20.363
I have the strangest feeling I've met him before.

13:20.626 --> 13:24.352
And you may meet him again, as your new father!

13:24.446 --> 13:27.410
Hubba, hubba, mommy like!

13:29.638 --> 13:32.690
If you ask me, the royal shakespeare company's

13:32.696 --> 13:35.612
latest season was much ado about nothing.

13:37.428 --> 13:39.071
I get that reference.

13:39.325 --> 13:42.611
And you can get me any time you want, handsome.

13:42.668 --> 13:45.993
I would be delighted to dine with you on the 12th.

13:50.345 --> 13:52.603
You're a smash, G.K.!

13:52.685 --> 13:54.672
It feels so sublime.

13:54.788 --> 13:56.021
I feel like I...

13:56.298 --> 13:58.853
+ could be indoors all night

13:59.295 --> 14:02.081
+ could use a fork and knife

14:02.466 --> 14:08.071
+ and never soil my suit

14:08.228 --> 14:11.180
+ I could be so polite

14:11.416 --> 14:20.282
+ start not a single fight and still not feel like a fruit

14:20.596 --> 14:23.843
+ how very nice that there's no lice

14:23.847 --> 14:32.120
+ in my hair and my toenails I don't bite

14:32.425 --> 14:38.280
+ now that I've reached the stage

14:38.567 --> 14:41.430
+ where I'm not full of rage

14:41.607 --> 14:51.233
+ I could be indoors indoors, all night!

14:55.478 --> 14:58.110
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to announce

14:58.178 --> 15:00.282
the winner of the science fair.

15:00.496 --> 15:02.942
Though I must note, I'm surprised Lisa Simpson

15:02.955 --> 15:04.382
didn't enter a project this year!

15:04.527 --> 15:06.623
That's where you're wrong, principal Skinner.

15:07.085 --> 15:11.663
I did enter a project, and it's been in plain sight the entire evening!

15:14.557 --> 15:17.502
Mr. G.K. Willington is not who he seems.

15:17.586 --> 15:20.840
In fact, he's someone you all know quite well.

15:21.005 --> 15:21.853
Is it me?

15:22.168 --> 15:24.712
I give you groundskeeper Willie!

15:28.706 --> 15:32.042
Well, mother, aren't you glad you didn't get more intimate with him?

15:32.488 --> 15:33.742
Who said I didn't?

15:35.955 --> 15:38.060
Maybe there's room on my sports wall.

15:42.215 --> 15:43.463
Now you have a friend.

15:43.888 --> 15:44.942
Good morning, Lisa.

15:45.136 --> 15:46.582
What's the lesson for today?

15:46.838 --> 15:49.340
How to smoke a pipe while summoning a falcon?

15:50.416 --> 15:51.873
Put the kettle on, featherbee.

15:52.128 --> 15:53.250
I'll be home soon.

15:54.668 --> 15:56.533
Willie, there are no more lessons.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.991
You're a proper gentleman, my work is done.

15:59.115 --> 16:01.031
But I don't know what to do with myself.

16:01.285 --> 16:03.422
All I've ever been is a groundskeeper.

16:03.575 --> 16:04.841
And that job's taken.

16:04.866 --> 16:07.290
Skinner dumped it on the next-lowest guy on the totem pole.

16:07.456 --> 16:09.082
For goodness sakes!

16:09.376 --> 16:10.840
How did I get up here?!

16:12.675 --> 16:15.311
I think this is the perfect job for the new you, Willie.

16:15.506 --> 16:17.553
It requires sophistication, tact,

16:17.845 --> 16:20.523
and you get to meet the highest class of 
people.

16:21.838 --> 16:22.823
Good evening, sir

16:22.956 --> 16:24.091
I'm your maitre d'.

16:24.216 --> 16:25.582
What's the "d" for?

16:25.758 --> 16:26.300
Dimwit?

16:28.338 --> 16:29.151
Laugh, jerk!

16:31.135 --> 16:32.990
I don't need your charity titters.

16:33.215 --> 16:36.453
Now, say hello to my girlfriend, Charity Titters.

16:36.827 --> 16:37.910
Right this way, ma'am.

16:39.115 --> 16:40.212
Thank you.

16:40.355 --> 16:41.823
No! Not now! Not now!

16:42.115 --> 16:43.483
Wait till we get to the booth.

16:53.695 --> 16:57.231
I'm so glad you washed that stupid logo off your head.

16:57.398 --> 16:58.871
Well, it did its job.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.992
Everyone's wearing blue pants now.

17:02.106 --> 17:06.330
Ay! El hombre invisible lleva pantalones azules!

17:09.224 --> 17:12.920
I'd like to get into some blue pants right now.

17:21.105 --> 17:22.820
what are those doing there?

17:22.926 --> 17:25.272
Earning us a hundred bucks a week, that's what.

17:25.446 --> 17:27.413
Except the maine potatoes one.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.893
It's just a reminder to myself.

17:36.605 --> 17:37.520
Hey, maitre d'!

17:37.947 --> 17:39.051
May I help you, sir?

17:39.227 --> 17:40.201
These rolls are stale!

17:40.316 --> 17:40.900
Bombardment!

17:41.198 --> 17:41.952
Bring me some more!

17:42.017 --> 17:42.592
Bombardment!

17:43.747 --> 17:45.560
And, some iced tea for the lady, please.

17:45.626 --> 17:46.252
Bombardment!

17:50.926 --> 17:56.662
+ I've a fancy suit and a clean white shir

17:57.225 --> 18:00.723
+ but I miss the days when tractor fumes

18:00.767 --> 18:06.281
+ blew up my skirt I was freezing cold

18:06.515 --> 18:12.261
+ and I slept in mold but I long for the shack

18:12.716 --> 18:18.652
+ where I lived she was true to me

18:18.966 --> 18:24.010
+ my old home of wood and when I passed out drunk

18:24.186 --> 18:28.090
+ from turpentine she understood

18:28.165 --> 18:30.973
+ life was so sublime...

18:31.305 --> 18:34.480
+ well boo-hoo 'cause I'm

18:34.955 --> 18:43.991
+ hanging ferns in the shack where you lived!

18:44.867 --> 18:47.462
If I had your voice, I'd talk-sing everything.

18:53.555 --> 18:55.583
So, how you doing, willie?

18:55.757 --> 18:56.931
I'm ebullient!

18:57.135 --> 18:58.612
I'm bubbling with glee!

18:58.785 --> 18:59.351
I'm...

19:00.098 --> 19:01.470
bloody miserable!

19:01.698 --> 19:03.510
I miss me crap shack!

19:05.035 --> 19:06.702
Hey, that's my table.

19:06.897 --> 19:07.620
Amscray!

19:07.905 --> 19:10.243
Sir, there are many other tables available.

19:10.467 --> 19:13.211
None that has a view of the yoga studio.

19:13.425 --> 19:14.361
Yeah, baby.

19:14.647 --> 19:15.721
Greet the sun.

19:15.965 --> 19:17.063
Downward dog.

19:18.965 --> 19:21.563
Sir, there is a child present.

19:21.755 --> 19:25.241
Hey, when I'm off the clock, kids can jump in the lake.

19:25.718 --> 19:28.431
Now get out of my booth, duchess of cornball.

19:28.588 --> 19:29.441
Very well, sir.

19:29.538 --> 19:31.403
But my name is Willie!

19:31.746 --> 19:35.601
Now, may I show you the dessert tray?!

19:35.757 --> 19:37.783
Dessert tray, that's a great gag.

19:38.577 --> 19:39.282
Can I use it?

19:40.015 --> 19:41.360
I'm taking it anyway!

19:42.658 --> 19:45.350
It is with great joy and a sense of, once again,

19:45.355 --> 19:47.190
everything is back to where it started,

19:47.236 --> 19:50.852
that we welcome our once and future groundskeeper, willie!

19:53.238 --> 19:55.613
Now let's all enjoy some punch and cookies.

19:56.047 --> 19:57.391
Willie, you can start cleaning up now.

19:57.685 --> 19:59.041
With pleasure!

20:02.375 --> 20:04.981
Heaven, I'm in heaven...

20:05.257 --> 20:07.011
Willie, please express yourself through mopping.

20:07.266 --> 20:07.740
All right.

20:09.218 --> 20:12.050
And when you're done, here are the keys to your new shack.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.413
It's just like I remember.

20:16.668 --> 20:18.540
With one little difference.

20:24.107 --> 20:26.061
You made that for me?

20:28.495 --> 20:30.293
I think I'll need a moment alone.

20:30.526 --> 20:31.423
I understand.

20:36.375 --> 20:37.581
I liked it the way it was!
