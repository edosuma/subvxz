00:00.205 --> 00:01.705
Buying a phone's a big deal.

00:01.773 --> 00:03.407
I mean think of how long
you'll have this thing.

00:03.424 --> 00:05.958
It's like buying
a car or a bra.

00:06.276 --> 00:07.809
Eight years, man.
Ow.

00:07.877 --> 00:10.379
Hey, uh, sorry, I was just
checking your credit score,

00:10.446 --> 00:13.181
and I got this number
that's crazily low,

00:13.249 --> 00:14.883
so I'll try again.

00:14.951 --> 00:16.718
Don't bother.
I'm sure it's right.

00:16.786 --> 00:18.787
- Seriously?
- Are you kidding me?

00:19.354 --> 00:21.755
250?! You get 150
just for being alive.

00:21.833 --> 00:22.756
Hey, Mojan!

00:22.824 --> 00:24.325
Got a 250 credit score!

00:24.393 --> 00:27.194
Well, I guess the $40 I saved
on that Gap card didn't pay off.

00:27.262 --> 00:29.195
Do you have, like,
a box of charity phones

00:29.263 --> 00:30.264
you're sending to Africa?

00:30.332 --> 00:32.266
- Can he just have one of those?
- Claire, Brendan,

00:32.334 --> 00:33.867
this guy's got
a 250 credit score.

00:33.935 --> 00:35.702
We're bringing everybody out?

00:36.770 --> 00:38.804
Look at this.

00:38.871 --> 00:40.640
Oh, I'm sorry. I've been
doing this a long time.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.342
I've just never seen
a score this low.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.011
Did you just wake up
from a coma?

00:47.681 --> 00:50.350

00:54.487 --> 00:55.955
But you've always
wanted a thing.

00:56.022 --> 00:58.590
This could be your thing,
like, the guy with no phone.

00:59.158 --> 00:59.891
Well, who is that guy?

00:59.960 --> 01:01.160
I don't want to be that guy.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.761
No, no, no,
it's like mysterious.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.363
It's like,
"I want to call Nick Miller."

01:04.431 --> 01:06.332
"You can't;
He doesn't have a phone."

01:06.899 --> 01:07.666
"What?!"

01:07.733 --> 01:09.633
You can go all Ghost Protocol
on everyone.

01:09.701 --> 01:10.801
See, that's cool.

01:10.869 --> 01:13.037
I mean, I always wanted
to be a mole person.

01:13.105 --> 01:15.606
<i>Schmidt, you're the
Michael Jordan of bar trivia.</i>

01:15.674 --> 01:17.575
We were in the
Greek mythology zone.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.077
I mean, you knew
every question.

01:19.144 --> 01:21.112
Perseus, Icarus, Medusa...

01:21.180 --> 01:22.380
Medeuce, deuce!

01:22.448 --> 01:23.747
Guys, you're shouting.

01:23.815 --> 01:25.048
I mean, you knew every answer.

01:25.116 --> 01:26.383
Like, what was
the tiebreaker you got?

01:26.451 --> 01:28.251
Calvin Coolidge's birthplace?

01:28.319 --> 01:29.652
Little Plymouth Notch, son.

01:29.720 --> 01:30.887
Wow, I'm done with this.
Hey, Shelby...

01:30.955 --> 01:32.822
I mean, seriously,
how did you know that?

01:32.890 --> 01:33.991
How do you forget that?

01:34.058 --> 01:35.492
You don't.

01:36.059 --> 01:36.793
Jar!

01:36.861 --> 01:38.095
I'm gonna jar myself
on that one.

01:38.662 --> 01:41.063
- He's like a trivia god.
- Girl, get up.

01:41.131 --> 01:42.865
Winston,
don't worry about it, man.

01:42.932 --> 01:44.233
It's your public school
education.

01:44.301 --> 01:45.701
You'll catch up.

01:46.768 --> 01:48.170
Jar again.

01:54.110 --> 01:55.210
Excuse me?

01:55.478 --> 01:56.312
Oh, hi.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.605
Yeah, hi, hi, I'm Russell
Schiller, Sarah's dad.

01:58.814 --> 01:59.814
- Oh, yes.
- We spoke on the phone.

01:59.882 --> 02:00.882
I'm Jessica Day.

02:01.949 --> 02:02.817
Did you just curtsy?

02:03.385 --> 02:04.986
I did, yes; I did.

02:05.553 --> 02:06.287
Is this a bad time?

02:06.605 --> 02:08.156
Nope, no, no, no,
I was just cleaning up

02:08.223 --> 02:09.924
from the sexual health class.

02:10.491 --> 02:11.359
I had to take condoms

02:11.427 --> 02:12.960
off <i>30</i> cucumbers,

02:13.028 --> 02:15.361
and condoms are harder
to take off than I thought.

02:15.429 --> 02:16.497
I know how to put them on,

02:16.564 --> 02:18.132
but I didn't know
how to take them off.

02:18.199 --> 02:21.335
I guess someone else
has always done it for me.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.904
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just got
off a flight from London.

02:24.971 --> 02:26.622
Maybe I'm a little out of it.

02:26.690 --> 02:28.274
Oh, London.

02:28.542 --> 02:29.942
Did you have a busy sch...

02:30.709 --> 02:32.011
Se-dule?

02:33.079 --> 02:34.246
Did you have fun?

02:34.314 --> 02:35.548
No, I was advising a merger.

02:35.615 --> 02:37.283
Oh, fair enough.

02:37.351 --> 02:41.887
Um, you wanted to talk to me
about Sarah's art.

02:41.955 --> 02:44.589
So, this is one
of the pieces she did.

02:45.157 --> 02:47.059
Um...

02:48.461 --> 02:50.395
That one's called, um,

02:50.963 --> 02:52.230
"At the Mall with Grandma."

02:54.699 --> 02:56.601
She made that in dream-cess,
which is where, um,

02:56.669 --> 02:58.537
I let the kids have time
to create something.

02:58.604 --> 03:01.005
Sarah's gonna be opting out
of dream-cess from now on.

03:01.073 --> 03:02.206
She'll use that same time

03:02.274 --> 03:04.808
to review her other schoolwork
with a tutor.

03:05.076 --> 03:07.210
Oh, did you talk to Sarah
about this?

03:07.278 --> 03:08.011
Well, I don't need to.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.614
I want her to know fractions
before she goes to high school.

03:10.682 --> 03:12.849
- Well, I follow the curriculum.
- My daughter is wearing doll's heads

03:12.917 --> 03:14.751
around her neck, so
whatever you're doing,

03:15.319 --> 03:17.153
keep it up.

03:17.221 --> 03:19.222
Okay, I talk to your daughter
every single day.

03:19.790 --> 03:21.524
Do you?
Because hiring a tutor

03:21.592 --> 03:23.926
is not the same thing
as spending time with her.

03:23.994 --> 03:25.861
I'm her father,
not her friend.

03:25.929 --> 03:28.931
I know what she needs.

03:28.999 --> 03:30.400
Give my best to Mrs. Monogamy.

03:30.468 --> 03:31.934
Cheerio.

03:34.286 --> 03:37.489
He's the third largest
donor in the city.

03:37.557 --> 03:40.091
We take his money and then what,
we have to answer to him?

03:40.159 --> 03:41.560
So, you're asking me
to give up my integrity?

03:41.627 --> 03:42.794
That's what
I'm telling you to do.

03:42.862 --> 03:44.262
Yes, we need his money.

03:44.330 --> 03:45.764
So, he pulls his donation.

03:45.832 --> 03:48.400
You know what?
I'll raise the money myself.

03:48.468 --> 03:50.434
I'll get a ragtag group
of kids together.

03:50.502 --> 03:53.136
A lost soul, an orphan,

03:53.204 --> 03:55.706
a Jewish kid with a keyboard,

03:55.774 --> 03:57.608
a little slut who can dance,

03:57.676 --> 03:59.076
and one fatso,

03:59.143 --> 04:00.143
and I'll choreograph
some dances,

04:00.211 --> 04:01.545
make a show.

04:01.613 --> 04:03.080
You did that already, Jess.

04:03.147 --> 04:05.148
It's called the spring musical,
and it literally brought in $60.

04:05.716 --> 04:07.083
Please don't make
me apologize.

04:07.900 --> 04:08.585
You're gonna go to his office.

04:08.652 --> 04:10.754
You're gonna say
that you were wrong.

04:10.821 --> 04:13.155
Say you're never gonna let
the kids do anything creative

04:13.723 --> 04:14.657
ever again.

04:14.725 --> 04:16.058
From now on,

04:16.125 --> 04:19.028
your classroom
is full-on North Korea:

04:19.096 --> 04:20.897
Math! Math! Math!

04:21.164 --> 04:23.098
Make sure he doesn't
pull the donation.

04:24.501 --> 04:25.768
When he was yelling at you,

04:25.835 --> 04:27.436
did do that little thing
with his mouth?

04:27.504 --> 04:29.271
You know,
that little smile thing?

04:29.338 --> 04:31.540
You know, like,
like where he goes, "Mmm"?

04:31.608 --> 04:33.008
That's really weird, Tanya.

04:33.075 --> 04:34.443
Apologize.

04:35.575 --> 04:36.680
Why did you make
me look stupid

04:36.681 --> 04:38.815
in front of Shelby
last nigh? - Wait, what?

04:38.883 --> 04:40.050
Which of the five
great lakes is located

04:40.117 --> 04:42.752
entirely in the United States?

04:42.820 --> 04:44.821
- Lake Erie?
- Yeah, if Lake Michigan didn't exist

04:44.889 --> 04:47.190
and we won a fictional
U.S.-Canada war.

04:47.507 --> 04:49.242
- Lake Michigan.
- Correct!

04:51.878 --> 04:54.079
Oh, you want me
to take a dive next time?

04:54.147 --> 04:55.480
- Take a dive?
- You know, like pretend like

04:55.548 --> 04:56.982
you know more than me
when Shelby's around,

04:57.050 --> 04:58.951
so it seems like
you're smarter.

04:59.018 --> 05:01.319
I know you'd do the same thing
for me if I were the dumber one.

05:01.387 --> 05:03.288
Wow, okay,
so let me get this straight:

05:03.356 --> 05:05.757
You think because you know a
few facts about Princess Kate,

05:05.825 --> 05:07.191
- that makes you smarter than me?
- First of all,

05:07.259 --> 05:09.994
Kate is a duchess and
whip-smart by all accounts.

05:10.062 --> 05:11.362
And second of all,
don't be so prideful.

05:11.429 --> 05:12.930
Look, man, there's
nothing wrong

05:12.998 --> 05:14.365
with being the second smartest
in the loft.

05:14.432 --> 05:16.400
You know what,
let me take that back.

05:16.468 --> 05:17.502
Jess is a teacher of children.

05:17.570 --> 05:18.970
You memorize facts.

05:19.037 --> 05:20.071
I can memorize facts.

05:20.138 --> 05:21.272
That doesn't make you smart.

05:21.340 --> 05:23.306
Okay, well, maybe,

05:23.374 --> 05:24.975
but I'm definitely smarter
than you.

05:25.042 --> 05:27.010
Whew! Glutes are done, my man.

05:27.078 --> 05:28.011
I'm gonna go to
the stairwell,

05:28.079 --> 05:29.947
work on my calves. Come with?

05:30.014 --> 05:32.115
Hell, no.

05:32.183 --> 05:33.350
You sure?

05:36.120 --> 05:37.120
<i>I have to grovel.</i>

05:37.188 --> 05:38.153
I hate groveling.

05:38.221 --> 05:39.421
I would have lasted
two seconds

05:39.489 --> 05:41.757
in the court of the Sun King.

05:41.824 --> 05:43.193
- I think about that all the time.
- You do?

05:43.271 --> 05:45.528
Do you know how much I grovel
on a daily basis?

05:45.596 --> 05:47.363
It is literally obscene.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.198
Come the weekend,

05:48.199 --> 05:49.999
I'm the one
who's filling up my cart

05:50.066 --> 05:53.102
with Fila, Nautica,
Impulse Fila,

05:53.169 --> 05:54.468
Hilfiger, CK,

05:54.536 --> 05:55.904
BR Leather cuff,

05:55.971 --> 05:56.971
and more Fila.

05:57.039 --> 05:58.439
This is the problem, Jess.

05:58.507 --> 05:59.740
It's rich people.

05:59.808 --> 06:01.475
We are right
where they want us, Jess:

06:01.543 --> 06:04.244
Just suckling on the
teat of consumerism.

06:04.312 --> 06:05.780
- Yeah. - That's the exact reason
I got rid of my phone.

06:05.847 --> 06:07.081
You were denied a cell phone

06:07.149 --> 06:09.884
because you have the credit
score of a homeless ghost.

06:09.951 --> 06:11.685
How I got here doesn't matter.

06:11.753 --> 06:13.020
You weigh more
than your credit score.

06:13.087 --> 06:14.221
I'm here now,

06:14.289 --> 06:15.456
- and I'm loving it.
- Yeah.

06:15.524 --> 06:16.924
I'm the guy with no phone.

06:17.491 --> 06:18.559
I mean, right now,

06:18.627 --> 06:20.359
I'm writing a letter
to my friend, Kev,

06:20.428 --> 06:22.762
seeing if he wants to party
with me this Friday.

06:23.830 --> 06:25.031
"What up, Kev?

06:25.399 --> 06:26.232
"You in?

06:26.300 --> 06:28.334
- Nick Miller."
- Yeah, Nick,

06:28.402 --> 06:30.303
he might pull the funding
from the school,

06:30.370 --> 06:31.037
so I'm just a little bit...

06:31.104 --> 06:32.605
Blame your period.

06:32.673 --> 06:34.106
I've actually
done this before.

06:34.174 --> 06:35.474
I mean, both parties knew

06:35.542 --> 06:38.310
that I was lying, obviously,

06:38.377 --> 06:40.311
but it didn't matter
because they knew

06:40.329 --> 06:42.647
that I had utterly
humiliated myself,

06:42.714 --> 06:45.116
and at the end of the day,
they respected that.

06:45.184 --> 06:46.085
I'm sorry; I just feel like

06:46.153 --> 06:48.487
someone should suggest
a simple apology.

06:48.755 --> 06:50.455
I know that's not where
we're headed here,

06:50.522 --> 06:51.956
but I'm just gonna
go on record

06:52.023 --> 06:54.459
and say, I think
you should apologize

06:54.926 --> 06:55.960
- like a human.
- No!

06:56.227 --> 06:57.528
No! I'm going with Nick

06:57.596 --> 06:59.296
'cause I don't think
I have to apologize.

06:59.364 --> 07:01.365
Yeah, Jess, so
march into his office,

07:01.433 --> 07:05.002
and say, "Hey, Mr. Fancyman,
you can't tell me what to do.

07:05.070 --> 07:06.103
"Your money

07:06.171 --> 07:07.237
doesn't own me."

07:07.305 --> 07:09.105
And then throw
away your phone.

07:09.173 --> 07:10.774
Yeah, I'm gonna throw my phone
into the fiery chasm

07:10.842 --> 07:12.675
where he keeps
his poor people.

07:12.742 --> 07:13.944
Actually, scratch that.

07:14.011 --> 07:16.746
My mom's got your number
in case of emergency.

07:17.314 --> 07:19.548
I want her to think that I can
bring something to the table.

07:20.116 --> 07:21.717
I care
about this girl, Elvin.

07:21.885 --> 07:23.353
I want her
to be my girlfriend.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.789
She sees me, all she sees is a
part-time nanny, and that's...

07:26.857 --> 07:28.423
You <i>are</i> a part-time nanny.

07:28.792 --> 07:29.959
I want her to think I'm smart.

07:31.026 --> 07:32.461
What about fake glasses?

07:32.528 --> 07:33.628
It worked for me.

07:34.865 --> 07:37.099
Okay, okay,
I'm on my way to his office,

07:37.666 --> 07:39.368
and I have a speech
I wrote for Fancyman,

07:39.435 --> 07:40.201
and I want to practice it.

07:40.268 --> 07:41.769
Why are you listening
to Nick?

07:41.837 --> 07:43.237
It is a horrible idea.

07:43.305 --> 07:44.539
Ghost Protocol, man.

07:44.607 --> 07:45.840
You're using my phone.

07:45.908 --> 07:47.308
It's not Ghost Protocol.

07:47.376 --> 07:49.243
It's you using my phone.

07:49.311 --> 07:51.779
This is a group call; I'm just
talking in my living room,

07:51.847 --> 07:53.581
and it happens to
go into that box.

07:53.649 --> 07:56.349
Okay, I'm gonna start with a
quote against social Darwinism,

07:56.817 --> 07:58.585
then a discussion
of the Gilded Age,

07:58.653 --> 08:00.120
the robber barons,
the Great Society,

08:00.187 --> 08:01.822
how we ended up
with a huge wealth disparity

08:01.890 --> 08:03.123
in this country,

08:03.224 --> 08:04.925
and then, I end
with a bluegrass version

08:04.993 --> 08:06.760
of Public Enemy's
"Fight the Power."

08:06.828 --> 08:07.761
Bad finish.

08:08.930 --> 08:09.863
What is that?

08:09.931 --> 08:11.398
Are you driving a lawn mower?

08:11.465 --> 08:12.865
No, I just...

08:14.033 --> 08:15.267
It's my car.

08:15.335 --> 08:16.736
Look, this is a
great opportunity.

08:16.803 --> 08:18.203
You need to ask yourself,

08:18.271 --> 08:19.939
where are you even going?

08:20.007 --> 08:22.041
- Buy a new car.
- You don't need a car.

08:22.108 --> 08:24.443
Oh, my car's stalled out.

08:25.011 --> 08:27.079
Can you guys come
and help me push it?

08:27.113 --> 08:29.614
Yeah, we'll be down
in a few minutes.

08:29.682 --> 08:30.882
Hey, can I help you?

08:30.950 --> 08:32.517
What? Oh, hi.

08:33.385 --> 08:34.284
Um,

08:34.352 --> 08:36.988
Uh, Mr. Schiller, um,

08:37.056 --> 08:39.722
- how'd you know I was here?
- I was driving by and I saw you.

08:39.890 --> 08:41.458
My office is right here.

08:41.993 --> 08:44.494
Oh, oh, what a coincidence.

08:44.495 --> 08:46.063
I had no idea.

08:46.630 --> 08:47.397
Weird.

08:48.465 --> 08:49.366
What's wrong with the car?

08:49.367 --> 08:50.434
Guy sounds like
matinee idol.

08:50.535 --> 08:52.036
Shut up, Schmidt.

08:52.103 --> 08:53.904
I'm just pushing it
to the nearest gas station.

08:53.972 --> 08:56.073
It's like, a mile away,
so I'm fine.

08:56.140 --> 08:58.442
I know a guy;
He'll be here in ten.

08:58.809 --> 09:00.743
- Oh, no, Mr. Schiller.
- Russell.

09:00.811 --> 09:02.579
Mr. Schiller, I can
take care of myself.

09:02.646 --> 09:04.681
It's how I was raised;
I wasn't raised with money,

09:04.748 --> 09:07.450
so when something broke,
we pretended it still worked.

09:07.517 --> 09:09.351
Some of my best memories
are pushing this car around

09:09.419 --> 09:10.653
on family vacations.

09:12.421 --> 09:13.321
Okay.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.791
Oh, yeah, tow truck's
on the way.

09:15.858 --> 09:18.159
Look, that's very nice
and generous of you,

09:18.227 --> 09:21.162
but I really... I-I mean,
I need my car, and...

09:22.230 --> 09:23.065
Here, let me help you.

09:24.932 --> 09:25.701
Take mine.

09:26.468 --> 09:27.535
- What?
- Take mine.

09:27.804 --> 09:29.905
- Here.
- No.

09:29.973 --> 09:31.741
Come on. Take mine.

09:31.973 --> 09:33.741
Uh, I don't know how
to drive cars that work.

09:33.809 --> 09:34.909
You can drop it off
tomorrow night.

09:34.977 --> 09:36.443
I'm having a party, a cookout.

09:36.511 --> 09:37.944
Come on over any time.
Come on.

09:39.947 --> 09:40.947
Thank you so much.

09:41.115 --> 09:42.149
This is amazing.

09:42.217 --> 09:43.684
I will return it
washed and polished.

09:43.752 --> 09:45.119
- Do you think it's a superhero?
- No.

09:45.186 --> 09:47.787
I think it's Jess
and some weird guy.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.188
Miss Day?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.856
Jess--
you can call me Jess.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.227
Great, I'll see
you tomorrow, Jess.

09:55.794 --> 09:56.963
Go is the one on the right.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.865
The one on the left is stop.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.001
Thanks.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.069
- What kind of car is it?
- We are the 99%.

10:03.137 --> 10:04.770
- Is it an SL?
- We the 99%.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.238
Does it have a push ignition?

10:06.805 --> 10:08.240
Does it have a push ignition?

10:08.307 --> 10:09.541
Please tell me
it's not a hybrid.

10:10.453 --> 10:14.155
And then he gives me his car,
just hands me the keys.

10:14.723 --> 10:16.690
It's like so...

10:16.758 --> 10:19.426
Rich people! They're always
giving you their cars.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.961
It's like, let them eat cars.

10:21.028 --> 10:22.295
You know what he's doing?

10:22.363 --> 10:23.963
He's taking back the power,

10:24.030 --> 10:25.832
so I have to go
to his cookout,

10:25.899 --> 10:27.433
and instead of standing up
to him,

10:27.501 --> 10:28.634
I have to grovel.

10:28.702 --> 10:30.503
Just a thought:

10:30.571 --> 10:32.938
What if he likes you?
No, I hate him.

10:33.006 --> 10:36.308
This guy is single
and he's sweet.

10:36.377 --> 10:38.177
Sweet? No.

10:38.245 --> 10:39.344
He's not sweet.

10:39.412 --> 10:41.145
I would never go for that guy.

10:41.213 --> 10:42.848
- Why?
- Because he's the type of guy

10:42.915 --> 10:45.316
who has a linen closet
and a towel warmer.

10:45.385 --> 10:46.518
You know me.

10:46.586 --> 10:48.453
I'm only attracted to guys

10:48.521 --> 10:49.821
who are afraid of success

10:49.889 --> 10:51.189
and think someone famous
stole their idea.

10:51.257 --> 10:52.858
I like an underdog.

10:52.925 --> 10:55.459
- Spencer didn't even own sheets.
- Yeah. He slept

10:55.527 --> 10:56.960
- on a pile of washcloths.
- Can I say something

10:57.028 --> 10:58.596
to you now that
you're not gonna like?

10:58.663 --> 11:01.164
- Yeah. - Maybe Russell
intimidates you.

11:01.232 --> 11:03.100
Because you wouldn't have
to take care of him,

11:03.167 --> 11:04.602
because he would
take care of you,

11:04.669 --> 11:05.770
and that just terrifies you.

11:05.837 --> 11:07.004
Uh, no.

11:07.071 --> 11:10.507
Spencer...
wore... jellies.

11:10.574 --> 11:12.876
How many pounds
in a metric ton?

11:12.943 --> 11:15.879
2,204.6. Next.

11:15.946 --> 11:18.581
In 1948, Albert
became the first...

11:18.649 --> 11:19.716
- American...
- ...American monkey in space.

11:19.784 --> 11:21.384
Let's go.

11:21.452 --> 11:23.520
- This ancient...
- Mesopotamia. Hit me.

11:23.587 --> 11:26.055
You don't actually know
what a Mesopotamia is.

11:26.123 --> 11:28.690
Of course I know what Mesopotamia is.
Don't be crazy.

11:28.758 --> 11:30.191
Use it in a sentence.

11:31.259 --> 11:33.862
Look, there's Mesopotamia.

11:33.930 --> 11:35.297
So I'm going to have to draw

11:35.364 --> 11:36.899
on your hatred of rich
people for this, okay?

11:36.966 --> 11:38.400
Hate me up.

11:38.468 --> 11:39.835
Well, for starters,
look at this place.

11:39.903 --> 11:41.236
I know. Ugh.

11:41.304 --> 11:43.137
I'm betting at one point
there was a moat.

11:43.204 --> 11:45.272
Rich boy punk.

11:45.340 --> 11:48.810
This hallway's excessive.
It's braggy.

11:48.877 --> 11:50.445
Well, I guess
everyone's out back.

11:50.512 --> 11:52.413
Ugh, look at this place, Jess.
Are you kidding me?

11:52.481 --> 11:53.781
It's so over-the-top.

11:53.849 --> 11:55.416
A kitchen island?
Be a man!

11:55.484 --> 11:57.084
- Let your counter attach to itself.
- I know.

11:57.152 --> 11:58.785
It's like, I can't chop
vegetables over here.

11:58.853 --> 12:01.087
I need to do it over here.
Love me, love me.

12:01.155 --> 12:02.522
I mean, we're making an egg,

12:02.590 --> 12:04.023
not going to outer space,
guys, right?

12:04.091 --> 12:05.291
Right. Nice burn.

12:10.064 --> 12:11.465
Whoa.

12:11.532 --> 12:13.100
Makes me want to sit
by the fire,

12:13.168 --> 12:15.335
and talk about how
annoying Gandhi is.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.538
Whoa, something's
happening to me, Jess.

12:20.106 --> 12:21.007
I want to sit at that desk

12:21.075 --> 12:23.843
- and veto a law.
- What are you doing, Nick?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.278
- That's someone else's stuff.
- Jess, when I put my hand on this desk,

12:26.346 --> 12:28.714
I feel sexually proficient
for the first time in my life.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.548
Nick, this man stands
for everything you hate.

12:32.218 --> 12:34.752
I'm President Miller!
You're all fired!

12:34.820 --> 12:36.188
Bring our boys home.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.356
Okay, this is how
evil geniuses are born.

12:38.423 --> 12:39.991
You smell that?
It smells like leather

12:40.058 --> 12:42.026
and Teddy Roosevelt
and wistfulness.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.530
I want to wear this cap.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.098
You're not helping me!

12:47.165 --> 12:49.733
Nick, I know
this room is beautiful,

12:49.801 --> 12:52.470
gentlemanly, and...
smells like Christmas,

12:52.537 --> 12:53.804
but you have to stay strong.

12:53.872 --> 12:55.872
I'm gonna go find Russell.

12:55.939 --> 12:58.574
Keep...
playing with that duck.

13:00.811 --> 13:03.113
I want to kill you.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.781
Because I respect you.

13:05.849 --> 13:07.917
I think I understand hunting!

13:09.000 --> 13:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:21.648 --> 13:22.882
Hello, Russell.

13:22.949 --> 13:24.684
Hey, Jess.
Thanks for coming.

13:24.751 --> 13:27.285
Oh, the mechanic called.
Your car's done.

13:27.352 --> 13:29.187
He also wanted me
to communicate to you

13:29.254 --> 13:31.255
that you need
to change your oil.

13:33.925 --> 13:35.960
I want to, first of all,
say thank you, Russell.

13:36.028 --> 13:38.163
Um, and second of all,
I want to say, um,

13:38.230 --> 13:40.765
I know you donate a lot of
money to this school, but...

13:40.833 --> 13:42.966
- You think I'm a snob.
- No. No.

13:43.034 --> 13:46.870
No, I have nothing
against people who...

13:47.438 --> 13:49.773
live in enormous mansions.

13:49.841 --> 13:51.675
Jess, I'm 42.

13:51.743 --> 13:54.178
I've made a lot of money,
and I enjoy spending it.

13:54.245 --> 13:55.913
Oh, you've got to try
one of these. - Oh.

13:55.980 --> 13:57.747
Deconstructed spring roll.

13:57.815 --> 13:59.348
- It's delicious.
- Oh.

13:59.416 --> 14:01.017
- Try it.
- Oh.

14:04.188 --> 14:05.988
Oh, my God!

14:06.056 --> 14:07.990
This is so amazing
I want to punch you!

14:08.058 --> 14:09.592
Russell! Russell.

14:09.659 --> 14:11.794
Come tell Carolyn about that
time you delivered that baby.

14:11.862 --> 14:13.862
Oh. Yeah.

14:13.930 --> 14:16.098
You delivered a baby? Just...
it was twins, actually.

14:16.565 --> 14:17.265
Twins?

14:25.541 --> 14:26.908
Are you wearing my sweater?

14:26.976 --> 14:29.277
No. Yes. It was on the back
of the chair.

14:29.345 --> 14:31.078
So I thought the sweater
belonged to the chair.

14:31.146 --> 14:32.479
I thought it was
a chair sweater.

14:32.547 --> 14:34.481
Those exist.

14:35.549 --> 14:36.283
I'm Nick.

14:36.351 --> 14:37.752
- Oh, you know Jess.
- Yes.

14:37.819 --> 14:39.186
I'm Jess' roommate.
I'm the guy with no phone,

14:39.254 --> 14:40.654
if she's told you.
That's my thing.

14:40.722 --> 14:42.456
- No phones.
- Why don't you have a phone?

14:42.523 --> 14:45.126
Because I don't want to be
tied to some corporate system.

14:46.193 --> 14:47.193
That, and no one
would give me one.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.161
I have incredibly
low credit ratings.

14:48.729 --> 14:49.896
Yeah.

14:49.964 --> 14:51.931
When I was your age, I had
a really skinny ponytail,

14:51.999 --> 14:54.134
and I think I was living off
of selling my own blood.

14:55.201 --> 14:56.935
That's funny.
Then what happened?

14:57.003 --> 14:58.772
One day you just woke up
and you had all this?

14:58.839 --> 15:00.706
Well, I realized
I wanted to grow up.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.242
- That's what happened.
- Um...

15:03.809 --> 15:05.978
I got this as a gift from the
company for Christmas, so...

15:06.045 --> 15:07.612
Oh, wow, that's great.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.115
My boss gave me three credit
cards he found at the bar,

15:10.183 --> 15:13.218
and said, "You didn't
get these from me."

15:13.286 --> 15:15.587
It's a bartender joke.
I'm a bartender. We...

15:15.655 --> 15:18.055
We don't steal credit cards.
Cool, cool.

15:18.123 --> 15:20.191
Here. Take it.
No, no, I can't take your phone, man.

15:20.259 --> 15:22.161
I can't... it's just...

15:23.728 --> 15:25.362
it feels really
good in my hand.

15:27.532 --> 15:30.268
Is it possible to be sexually
attracted to an object?

15:30.335 --> 15:32.636
Yes, it is.
It really is.

15:34.038 --> 15:37.007
- You can keep the sweater.
- Thanks, I...

15:37.074 --> 15:40.410
I don't know why I put it on,
to be honest with you.

15:40.477 --> 15:43.113
I just came in here, and it
smelled like Shakespeare,

15:43.181 --> 15:45.615
if Shakespeare were
a damn cowboy.

15:46.183 --> 15:48.451
And hawk's nests, and boat fuel,
and cigars and burping...

15:48.519 --> 15:49.819
- man stuff!
- Yeah, yeah, enjoy it.

15:50.386 --> 15:51.320
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:51.387 --> 15:52.822
- I appreciate you.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

15:52.889 --> 15:56.425
Hey, Russell, why are you
being so nice to me?

15:56.992 --> 15:58.127
Well, you're
Jess's friend, right?

15:59.929 --> 16:01.263
Now, you fold that sweater.

16:01.331 --> 16:02.364
Don't hang it.

16:02.432 --> 16:04.366
You listening to me?
Fold it.

16:04.934 --> 16:06.968
Ah, I don't care.
Do whatever you want.

16:07.036 --> 16:08.569
That was really funny, man!

16:09.137 --> 16:10.305
Why did I...?

16:13.208 --> 16:14.909
Bidet!

16:15.977 --> 16:17.745
Bidet if I do.

16:25.519 --> 16:28.155
Oh, my God!

16:28.223 --> 16:30.657
- Oh, my gosh. Shut up.
- Jess, is that you?

16:30.725 --> 16:32.459
- Oh, God! Oh, God.
- What's wrong?

16:33.526 --> 16:34.728
Sorry, Jess.
I'm coming in.

16:34.795 --> 16:36.663
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?

16:36.731 --> 16:38.530
- Oh, my God! I just...
- Wait, wait, wait.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.766
- Ow! - No, I just
pressed some buttons

16:40.834 --> 16:42.468
- with cartoon characters on them.
- Yeah, it's Japanese.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.470
Of course it's
a Japanese bidet.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.472
Of course you have
a Japanese bidet.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.407
Look, Russell,
I want to tell you

16:48.475 --> 16:50.343
that I am not sorry
about what I said

16:50.410 --> 16:53.145
because Sara is 12,
and she is creative,

16:53.213 --> 16:54.512
and I don't care
if you pull your donation,

16:54.580 --> 16:56.547
- I am not gonna grovel...
- Why did you think I was

16:56.615 --> 16:58.483
going to pull the donation?
I would never do that.

16:58.550 --> 17:01.486
Okay.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.054
Oh, jeez.

17:03.122 --> 17:04.756
It is some really
deep cleaning here.

17:04.823 --> 17:05.857
- Oh, God.
- No, Jess, Jess!

17:05.925 --> 17:07.157
- Wait!
- Oh!

17:07.226 --> 17:09.861
Jess, you put it up
to six happy faces.

17:09.928 --> 17:11.560
I've never gone past three.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.498
Jess, why are we leaving?

17:15.066 --> 17:16.867
And why are you all wet?

17:16.935 --> 17:19.469
Okay, did you take a bath in his
tub because you wanted to see

17:19.537 --> 17:20.637
what it'd feel like to be him?

17:20.704 --> 17:21.805
'Cause, weirdly, I get that.

17:21.873 --> 17:23.306
No. I want to leave

17:23.374 --> 17:25.375
because we don't
fit in here, Nick.

17:25.443 --> 17:27.042
I know that I've been saying
you can't give into this guy,

17:27.109 --> 17:29.278
but I don't think that you
should run from him, either.

17:29.345 --> 17:32.481
'Cause no matter where you go,
he could find you.

17:32.998 --> 17:34.183
I believe that.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.651
No, running's good.
I'm gonna run.

17:35.719 --> 17:37.119
Hey, Jess, stop.

17:37.187 --> 17:38.387
Look, this may
complicate things,

17:39.105 --> 17:40.623
but I'm in love with him.

17:40.691 --> 17:42.190
Shut up!
No, I won't shut up.

17:42.257 --> 17:43.925
He smells like strong coffee

17:43.993 --> 17:45.860
and going to see a man
about a horse.

17:45.928 --> 17:47.528
You're ridiculous, Nick.
Let's go.

17:47.597 --> 17:50.131
I am ridiculous, okay, but no.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.367
Be a grown-up.

17:53.935 --> 17:55.770
He likes you, Jess.

17:57.338 --> 17:58.572
Go back in there.

17:58.639 --> 17:59.873
I think it'd be good for you.

18:02.477 --> 18:04.444
And I'm not just saying that
because I'm in love with him.

18:05.712 --> 18:06.880
Just do it.

18:09.284 --> 18:11.585
Don't be intimidated just
because you're just younger,

18:11.653 --> 18:14.087
poorer and wetter
than everybody in there.

18:14.154 --> 18:15.655
Goldfinger!
I mean, no, no.

18:15.723 --> 18:17.090
I meant to say
Golden-Golden Hind!

18:17.157 --> 18:18.891
Golden Hind is
what I meant to say.

18:18.959 --> 18:20.093
- No...
- Winston,

18:20.160 --> 18:21.628
you are all over the place.

18:21.695 --> 18:24.130
The Green Bay Packers did not
invent the T formation,

18:24.697 --> 18:26.798
nor was Crispin Glover
the first man to die

18:26.866 --> 18:28.234
- in the Revolutionary War.
- Shh.

18:28.301 --> 18:30.301
- This is supposed to be fun.
- Look, Babe, it is fun.

18:30.369 --> 18:31.837
I just don't want to look
stupid in front of everybody.

18:31.904 --> 18:32.871
- All right?
- You're not stupid.

18:32.939 --> 18:34.372
Well, I mean,
he did skip Earth

18:34.440 --> 18:35.907
when listing the planets.

18:35.975 --> 18:38.376
What has
gotten into you today?

18:38.444 --> 18:41.146
I just... I just didn't want
you to think I was an idiot.

18:41.213 --> 18:45.050
You tried to memorize all the
trivia answers? Winston!

18:45.118 --> 18:50.554
I don't want some smart,
rich guy who owns his own car.

18:50.622 --> 18:53.157
I want to be with you.

18:53.724 --> 18:56.961
I don't care if you don't know
Ernest Hemingway's birthplace.

18:57.029 --> 18:58.595
Oak Park, Illinois.

19:00.831 --> 19:02.565
So, what are you saying?

19:02.633 --> 19:04.034
Are we doing this?
Is this real?

19:04.101 --> 19:05.669
Like, are you my girlfriend?

19:05.736 --> 19:07.037
Because if that's
what you're saying,

19:07.104 --> 19:08.638
then that would
make me very happy.

19:08.706 --> 19:10.406
Mm, me, too.

19:12.543 --> 19:14.878
Shelby, be careful
with his mustache, please.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.412
- Mmm.
- It's very delicate.

19:17.847 --> 19:19.514
I can't watch this anymore.

19:19.582 --> 19:21.383
Winston, I hope
you're better in bed

19:21.450 --> 19:24.319
because your street work
is embarrassing.

19:24.387 --> 19:27.289
Am I talking too much?
I don't want to ruin the moment.

19:27.356 --> 19:29.424
You know what? If this was
my grandmother's building,

19:29.792 --> 19:31.325
she'd be outside
on the patio,

19:31.393 --> 19:32.794
and she'd be
yelling down at you,

19:32.861 --> 19:33.695
and she'd be saying,

19:33.762 --> 19:34.896
"You look beautiful.

19:35.663 --> 19:37.599
"The two of you are
a beautiful couple.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.534
I'm glad you found
one another."

19:39.602 --> 19:42.236
But she wouldn't invite you up
because she's a horrible racist.

19:44.506 --> 19:47.074
You want me
to put on some Jodeci?

19:49.578 --> 19:52.179
There you are.
I was looking for you.

19:52.247 --> 19:53.280
Okay....

19:53.648 --> 19:55.115
- Listen.
- Uh-huh.

19:55.183 --> 19:58.184
I'm not used to people
who have it all together.

19:58.252 --> 20:00.986
I think... you scare me.

20:01.054 --> 20:02.354
Oh, no, no, I don't...

20:02.922 --> 20:04.757
I don't have it all together.

20:04.825 --> 20:06.959
I don't even know
how to talk to my own kid.

20:07.027 --> 20:08.528
I can't even remember
the last time she hugged me

20:08.596 --> 20:09.895
and used both arms.

20:09.963 --> 20:12.332
She said she wanted
to go bra shopping,

20:12.399 --> 20:13.765
and so I bought
her a ski vest.

20:14.833 --> 20:16.801
Look, every eye roll

20:17.869 --> 20:19.638
means you're doing
something right.

20:19.706 --> 20:21.440
- Really?
- No, that's just what

20:21.507 --> 20:23.375
I tell parents to make
them feel better.

20:24.143 --> 20:25.644
Jess, will you have dinner
with me?

20:29.531 --> 20:30.314
Yes.

20:30.682 --> 20:32.516
Great. Good.

20:34.853 --> 20:36.920
Sh-Should I, um,
text you, or...?

20:36.988 --> 20:39.189
- No. I'll call.
- Great.

20:39.558 --> 20:41.626
- Okay, cool.
- All right, cool.

20:41.693 --> 20:44.895
Oh, no... Hey, Jess.

20:44.963 --> 20:46.630
Jess, why are you
in the koi pond?!

20:46.697 --> 20:47.997
- Jess, are you okay?
- Oh, God, oh, God.

20:48.065 --> 20:49.899
- Okay, come here.
- Oh, God!

20:49.967 --> 20:51.134
- Koi in my dress!
- Let me help you.

20:51.201 --> 20:52.636
Koi in my dress!

20:52.703 --> 20:53.836
Are you all right?

20:53.904 --> 20:55.372
Oh, you got a fish
in your dress.

20:55.439 --> 20:57.206
I didn't ask you!
I'm talking to you!

20:57.275 --> 21:00.042
You want to come in here and
charge me a billion dollars?

21:01.010 --> 21:02.278
That's nothing to me!

21:04.381 --> 21:06.782
Want it? Want it?

21:06.849 --> 21:08.617
You're off the streets.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.085
I don't want to, either.

21:10.153 --> 21:11.820
You're the best cop I got!

21:11.888 --> 21:13.455
As President Miller of Earth,

21:13.523 --> 21:15.725
I'd like to speak to the
Galactic Emperor, please.

21:17.293 --> 21:18.293
Yeah, it's about money.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.162
I'm gonna push a piece
of paper across the desk

21:20.229 --> 21:22.063
that I've written
a little number on.

21:22.131 --> 21:25.099
Why don't I just tell you?
It's five kabillion dollars.

21:25.167 --> 21:26.335
So, what do you say?

21:26.367 --> 21:28.935
Is China mine, Mr. Ying?

21:29.103 --> 21:33.204
