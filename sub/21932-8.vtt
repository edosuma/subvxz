say about Mr. Caswell?

- Why?

10:08.806 --> 10:10.827
Well, he was the most
accomplished of the lot.

10:10.862 --> 10:11.911
Really?

10:12.785 --> 10:15.365
That painting doesn't
seem anything special.

10:15.886 --> 10:18.468
His work, apparently,
was held in high regard.

10:18.657 --> 10:21.182
Rumour has it he was to
open that new art gallery.

10:21.205 --> 10:24.808
- A very prestigious honour.
- And perhaps motive for murder.

10:24.842 --> 10:26.368
All right then, gentlemen.

not the most interesting city

11:21.333 --> 11:22.856

about my current company.

Bad luck, Denton.

12:06.766 --> 12:08.585
- What do you mean?
- Well, what with Caswell dead,

12:08.617 --> 12:10.340
you, like the rest of
us would have a chance.

12:10.378 --> 12:12.013
That is, if you ever finished anything.

12:12.090 --> 12:14.295
Who the bloody hell is
coming? Excuse my language.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.669
- Lady Belinda!
- Who's Lady Belinda?

12:16.689 --> 12:18.755
Either an angel or
devil, given her mood.

12:18.776 --> 12:21.146
She should have told us
that she was on her way.

12:21.192 --> 12:23.604
And what would be the fun in that?

12:26.966 --> 12:28.092
Now...

12:30.016 --> 12:31.676
what have you to show me?

12:33.481 --> 12:37.758
None of you have a fraction
of poor Mr. Caswell's ability.

12:38.447 --> 12:39.655
What is this?

12:40.056 --> 12:41.665
The Waterdown Falls.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.063
That's a waterfall?

12:43.387 --> 12:46.026
It looks more like a melted candle.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.661
Mr. Denton, wy do you even bother?

12:50.627 --> 12:52.267
You said I had promise.

12:52.298 --> 12:54.291
And I once had my maidenhead.

12:54.698 --> 12:57.557
It seems that both our
early virtues have left us.

13:00.503 --> 13:02.909
Your work is better
suited to the Grand Guignol

13:02.935 --> 13:04.644
than the halls of this fair city.

13:04.849 --> 13:07.639
Perhaps you should stop trying
to prove you're not a woman.

13:12.227 --> 13:14.553
Now this is quite something.

13:18.293 --> 13:20.582
But I can also see something else.

13:20.885 --> 13:23.153
This was painted by a man.

13:23.179 --> 13:24.805
A real man.

13:25.126 --> 13:28.358
- You are?
- Inspector Thomas C. Brackenreid.

13:28.392 --> 13:30.293
A pleasure, Inspector.

13:30.730 --> 13:32.504
How long have you been painting?

13:32.825 --> 13:34.374
Just over an hour.

13:35.986 --> 13:38.075
And quick witted as well.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.389
Wherever did you find this jewel?

13:40.453 --> 13:44.174
- He recently joined us.
- Oh, joined and surpassed.

13:45.049 --> 13:47.851
Sir, I would like to
offer you my patronage.

13:47.915 --> 13:49.804
Did you take a close look at my work?

13:49.814 --> 13:52.248
Oh, Mr. Armbruster. Don't
grovel, it's unbecoming.

13:53.352 --> 13:55.973
I will take care of your
every creature comfort.

13:56.179 --> 13:58.021
In exchange for what?

13:58.055 --> 13:59.752
In exchange for the...

13:59.791 --> 14:01.838
privilege to be the
first to see your work.

14:02.105 --> 14:04.553
In exchange for nothing
but a chance for me

14:04.764 --> 14:06.682
to savour your talent.

14:09.033 --> 14:11.601
(FOOTSTEPS)

14:16.651 --> 14:18.285
Will this suit you?

14:18.974 --> 14:20.748
Oh, very much.

14:22.110 --> 14:24.779
You are also welcome
to share my residence.

14:26.516 --> 14:28.599
I already have a place to hang my hat.

14:29.627 --> 14:32.758
It's hardly your hat I'm interested in.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.539
I'm open for you.

14:36.475 --> 14:37.946
Day or night.

14:47.318 --> 14:50.557
Oh, you're not at this again, are you?

14:50.603 --> 14:52.510
- I am.
- (SIGHING)

14:52.536 --> 14:53.832
Well...

14:54.536 --> 14:57.092
- Hmm.
- What does that mean? Hmm.

14:57.374 --> 15:00.634
I just don't really
care for it, that's all.

15:01.092 --> 15:03.127
Everyone's entitled to an opinion.

15:03.252 --> 15:05.409
No matter how misguided.

15:05.862 --> 15:09.251
If you want to paint, you can
go home and spruce up the porch.

15:09.312 --> 15:11.096
It could use a coat or two.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.898
This? Honestly!

15:16.006 --> 15:19.163
There is just something
in this work that moves me.

15:19.811 --> 15:21.805
It isn't work, it's art.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.422
And quite frankly, I think the
Inspector is a better painter.

15:24.437 --> 15:26.859
- Well, I like it.
- Why?

15:27.245 --> 15:28.653
It's hard to say.

15:28.669 --> 15:31.450
I'm a relatively intelligent man, try.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.401
You either like it or you don't.

15:34.735 --> 15:36.858
Yes, but... why?

15:40.298 --> 15:41.527
I just like it.

15:41.548 --> 15:43.415
I don't think I could explain it to you.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.032
Well I don't think it's very good.

15:46.361 --> 15:48.412
The trees don't even look like trees.

15:48.427 --> 15:51.177
They evoke the spirit of trees.

15:52.396 --> 15:54.370
Perhaps that's the case due to

15:54.379 --> 15:57.418
the artist's inability
to depict them accurately.

15:58.133 --> 16:00.992
Well, I like it and I think
I'm going to hang it here.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.092
Perfect.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.807
That way, there'll be no
one to complain about it.

16:11.659 --> 16:13.910
It's a shame Belinda
passed you by again.

16:14.035 --> 16:15.988
I could offer you the
same sympathy as well.

16:16.697 --> 16:19.104
Apparently she prefers
the work of a neophyte.

16:19.155 --> 16:23.330
Just because she is rich, it does
not mean she has any expertise.

16:24.111 --> 16:26.805
Sounds to me like
sour grapes, gentlemen.

16:29.547 --> 16:30.949
What's his tale of woe?

16:30.979 --> 16:32.943
I've hardly seen him
put paint to canvas.

16:33.026 --> 16:36.034
Mr. Denton has had a hard time of it.

16:36.159 --> 16:38.563
He was once a prodigious painter

16:38.583 --> 16:40.526
but a fire destroyed all of his work.

16:40.721 --> 16:44.095
- What a pity.
- More than that, it's tragic.

16:44.383 --> 16:47.194
He needs to pick up the brush
again and get back to it.

16:47.235 --> 16:48.397
He has tried,

16:48.459 --> 16:51.163
but it seems his muse has left him.

16:51.189 --> 16:53.947
It must be because of
his engaging personality.

16:54.463 --> 16:55.625
Hm.

16:56.978 --> 16:59.564
- Oh! I'll have a cup, please, love.
- You have hands.

16:59.584 --> 17:02.375
Being a female does
not make me your slave.

17:02.432 --> 17:03.979
Oh, you're one of those.

17:04.308 --> 17:06.555
I only asked because
you're already there.

17:07.253 --> 17:08.550
All right.

17:09.752 --> 17:12.159
So, how does it feel?

17:12.986 --> 17:14.157
Thank you.

17:14.210 --> 17:15.695
Being the chosen one.

17:16.971 --> 17:18.255
It feels good.

17:18.281 --> 17:19.891
I can't say that it doesn't.

17:19.936 --> 17:22.179
Mr. Caswell was
Belinda's last chosen one.

17:22.204 --> 17:23.792
I don't think it felt good for him.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.547
What are you suggesting?

17:26.256 --> 17:29.413
Simply that you'd be advised
to stay on her good side.

17:29.538 --> 17:31.922
Taking a patronage is
a double edged sword.

17:31.943 --> 17:34.420
Lovely if you fulfill
the patron's wishes,

17:34.779 --> 17:36.652
not so pleasant if you don't.

17:36.724 --> 17:38.066
And Mr. Caswell didn't.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.348
Given Belinda's past
and Mr. Caswell's fate,

17:40.358 --> 17:41.880
I think that's a safe assumption.

17:41.906 --> 17:43.422
What do you mean, her past?

17:43.736 --> 17:45.284
She used to have a husband.

17:45.409 --> 17:47.150
They go out for a tramp in the woods.

17:47.536 --> 17:50.030
- She doesn't have one anymore.
- Hm.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.362
Paint me, Thomas.

me more than Constantinople.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.303
The Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.995
A city half in Europe and half in Asia.

18:34.843 --> 18:36.714
So where is it, then?

18:37.100 --> 18:38.915
Eurasia, I suppose.

18:39.527 --> 18:41.619
That's not a place. That's stupid.

18:41.634 --> 18:44.724
Oh, Higgins! Be quiet.
Have you seen Egypt?

18:44.904 --> 18:48.343
I camped under the visage
of the Great Sphinx.

18:48.569 --> 18:50.842
Luncheoned by the pyramids of Khufu,

18:50.883 --> 18:53.577
swam in waters of the Nile river.

18:54.543 --> 18:57.088
It's incredible to walk the roads

18:57.098 --> 19:00.012
of a civilization eons
older than our own.

19:00.434 --> 19:03.071
Yes, I most certainly did see Egypt.

19:03.196 --> 19:04.968
And one day, I hope to see it again.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.465
It's very good, sir,

19:19.491 --> 19:22.766
but are you sure this
is the proper place?

19:23.287 --> 19:24.712
Oh, let them have an ogle.

19:24.713 --> 19:26.557
As close as some of them
will ever come, I imagine.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.855
Especially Higgins.

19:28.113 --> 19:31.361
- Sir, have you found out anything?
- I have indeed.

19:31.395 --> 19:32.643
What you're looking at

19:32.644 --> 19:35.221
is not only a fine portrait
of a beautiful woman.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.496
But also you're looking
at the primary suspect.

19:37.515 --> 19:39.123
Oh? Who is she?

19:39.148 --> 19:40.809
Lady Belinda Carlye.

19:40.819 --> 19:44.104
Recently widowed and patron
of the arts and artists.

19:44.229 --> 19:45.539
Thomas!

19:46.053 --> 19:48.310
Talk to Miss Coyle about
her. She may know something.

19:50.516 --> 19:53.807
- Oh, it looks marvelous.
- Lady Carlye,

19:53.859 --> 19:56.506
- Detective William Murdoch.
- Oh. Charmed.

Lady Carlye.

comfortable with the attention.

Oh let them look. As you can see, I am.

20:14.535 --> 20:16.099
Thomas, could I have
a moment of your time?

20:16.160 --> 20:18.541
- Certainly.
- Not here.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.479
It was a pleasure to meet
you, Detective Murdoch.

20:20.484 --> 20:22.458
I do hope our paths will cross again.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.026
Well, they just might.

Attention, all.

20:33.522 --> 20:35.954

20:45.002 --> 20:48.390
selections of your work
at the gallery's opening.

20:49.665 --> 20:53.644
And I am also pleased to
announce that the featured work

20:53.983 --> 20:58.682
will be Thomas's most recent
portrait of yours truly.

(SIGHING) Where did you get this?

21:42.535 --> 21:44.719
- I painted it.
- You?!

21:44.977 --> 21:47.028
From a photograph I hope.

21:47.938 --> 21:49.218
You...

21:49.896 --> 21:50.991
Her?

21:51.325 --> 21:53.927
- And I just don't...
- I'm a painter and she's just a subject.

21:53.952 --> 21:56.251
A stark naked subject!

And nothing to my eye
but shadows and light.

22:26.296 --> 22:29.876
Tell me about Lady Carlye's
association with your group.

22:29.921 --> 22:32.659
She is hardly associated with the group.

22:32.929 --> 22:34.864
She simply has her claws

22:38.296 --> 22:42.570
Yes. But before the "portly fool"...

22:42.609 --> 22:45.024
She was Gavin Caswell's patron.

22:45.149 --> 22:47.280
The recently-murdered Gavin Caswell.

22:47.319 --> 22:49.221
I believe that's what I said.

22:52.094 --> 22:54.130
What was their relationship like

22:54.165 --> 22:56.132
before he was murdered?

22:56.650 --> 22:58.430
They were inseparable...

22:58.555 --> 23:02.934
Until Mr. Caswell developed something
Mrs. Carlye could not tolerate.

23:03.255 --> 23:05.014
What was that?

23:05.745 --> 23:07.453
A backbone.

23:08.847 --> 23:10.606
Could you elaborate?

23:10.731 --> 23:13.748
Mr. Caswell was extremely
popular with Mrs. Carlye

23:13.788 --> 23:15.861
when he painted in a style she favoured.

23:15.906 --> 23:19.164
- But when he didn't...
- She was furious.

23:19.395 --> 23:21.305
And let me tell you, sir,

23:21.838 --> 23:25.313
there are few more
dangerous than a proud woman

23:25.345 --> 23:27.402
who feels disrespected.

23:30.056 --> 23:32.335
But if you want to know more about her,

23:32.369 --> 23:33.546
talk to her staff

23:33.571 --> 23:36.639
and ask about her marriage
to her now-dead husband.

23:38.462 --> 23:42.792
Word is she was no
lady before she met him.

comfortable, Miss Bloom?

23:49.099 --> 23:51.410
Very. And you?

As much as I can be,
considering the circumstances.

23:57.322 --> 23:58.948
May I see what you're doing?

No, you must wait 'til I'm finished.

24:40.095 --> 24:41.740
I want one of myself.

- Where did this come from?
- (STAMMERING): No. The...

24:44.445 --> 24:45.969
the Inspector painted it.

24:46.033 --> 24:48.520
Oh, well! Then you must
introduce me to the Inspector.

24:49.548 --> 24:52.203
Yes Henry, you must.

24:59.028 --> 25:00.866
And when did you do this?

25:00.937 --> 25:03.186
- Just yesterday.
- I see.

25:04.356 --> 25:06.290
I think I should feature
it at the opening.

25:06.415 --> 25:08.302
Oh, I think not.

25:09.048 --> 25:10.352
It is my show.

25:10.365 --> 25:13.019
And it is my gallery. You will
feature what I tell you to.

25:13.058 --> 25:14.703
Oh, I think not.

25:16.663 --> 25:19.441
I do hope I have not created a monster.

25:19.486 --> 25:23.573
- No... You've created an artist.
- Oh...

25:23.985 --> 25:25.938
Is that what you are?

25:26.722 --> 25:28.227
May I remind you, Thomas,

25:28.265 --> 25:32.009

In here, now!

25:54.207 --> 25:56.623
- Sir.
- Did you do this?

25:56.748 --> 25:59.677
- Good gracious, no.
- Then who was in my office?

25:59.735 --> 26:02.369
Sir, I just returned from lunch
a scant few minutes ago myself.

26:02.439 --> 26:04.105
Oh, what a shame.

26:04.548 --> 26:07.074
- Did you do this?
- Me? Of course not.

26:07.556 --> 26:10.480
I suppose you're back to
featuring me at your showing.

26:10.500 --> 26:11.817
No.

26:12.203 --> 26:13.460
No?

26:13.585 --> 26:15.953
My work has grown since then.

26:15.994 --> 26:18.224
Grown? You've only been
at it for a few days.

26:18.281 --> 26:20.148
I'm a quick study.

26:20.454 --> 26:24.175
If you have grown so much,
then you can paint me again.

26:24.239 --> 26:26.161
And better this time.

26:26.225 --> 26:28.750
I will open the show.

26:28.776 --> 26:30.569
You will not!

26:32.047 --> 26:33.872
- Sir.
- What is it, Murdoch?

26:33.904 --> 26:35.190
A moment?

26:39.464 --> 26:41.959
Sir, you must remain on this case.

26:42.010 --> 26:43.463
You're my best chance.

26:43.501 --> 26:45.217
This woman is being insufferable.

26:45.275 --> 26:49.093
That may be, but she
remains our primary suspect.

Lady Carlye.

26:59.799 --> 27:01.541
I shall paint you.

27:01.875 --> 27:03.128
Good!

27:03.186 --> 27:04.998
Let's get at it, then.

27:07.987 --> 27:10.937
I should not speak ill of Lady Carlye.

27:11.149 --> 27:13.611
She did keep me on
after her husband died.

27:13.624 --> 27:16.065
I'm not asking you to speak ill of her.

27:16.091 --> 27:18.675
I only ask that you speak the truth.

27:18.893 --> 27:21.576
Where was Lady Carlye two days ago?

27:21.611 --> 27:23.136
I don't know.

27:24.543 --> 27:27.519
Could you describe
relations between Lady Carlye

27:27.538 --> 27:29.402
and her late husband?

27:29.678 --> 27:31.998
They fought, those two.

27:32.332 --> 27:36.110
She told me it was because
they were madly in love.

27:36.303 --> 27:39.856
Looked like madness
plain and simple to me.

27:40.653 --> 27:42.408
Could you explain that?

27:42.698 --> 27:45.589
I saw her hit him, sir.

27:45.714 --> 27:48.532
And he was a man twice her age.

27:48.552 --> 27:51.777
It was not like any love I've ever seen.

27:53.538 --> 27:55.203
Thank you.

27:57.330 --> 28:00.582
If I had known it was stolen, I
would have reported it immediately.

28:00.647 --> 28:03.019
- Undoubtedly.
- Someone brought it in last night.

28:03.032 --> 28:05.300
I didn't see the notice
it was stolen until later.

28:05.425 --> 28:08.063
Thank you for informing me. Do you
have any idea who brought it in?

28:08.089 --> 28:10.029
- John Smith.
- An alias.

28:10.030 --> 28:11.848
That's what made me suspicious.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.520
Well, thank you very much.

28:13.539 --> 28:16.078
- If it remains unclaimed...
- It won't.

28:20.872 --> 28:22.737
I don't know.

28:25.171 --> 28:28.750
Yes, I do know. I don't like it.

28:29.656 --> 28:31.700
I simply paint what I see.

best start seeing better.

going to say anything.

Sir, all whom I have spoken
to regarding Belinda Carlye

29:47.086 --> 29:48.819
state she has a violent temper.

29:48.944 --> 29:50.834
Fiery is more like it.

29:51.215 --> 29:54.289
Her husband died under
mysterious circumstances.

29:54.294 --> 29:56.124
An accident is what I heard.

29:57.559 --> 29:59.245
Sir, she was missing from her home

29:59.276 --> 30:01.075
the day Gavin Caswell was murdered.

30:01.327 --> 30:04.372
A socialite leaves home, how suspicious!

All that said, I would like to
bring her in for questioning.

30:08.802 --> 30:10.011

30:10.031 --> 30:12.041
but not until tomorrow,
or the day after.

30:12.166 --> 30:14.185
I will not have my show compromised!

30:14.247 --> 30:17.980
Sir, there is a real possibility
you could become her next victim.

30:18.012 --> 30:20.139
Oh, is that so? Well,
if that's the case,

30:20.165 --> 30:22.774
I would imagine it would ensure
my work is even more valuable.

- That was a joke, Murdoch.

- Well I...
- And I do believe

he is an accomplished painter.

- This is a beautiful gallery.

city's lacked up to this point.

It looks like another
ordinary painting to me.

Ah, finally.

I thought you were going
to keep me here all night.

34:23.202 --> 34:24.500
I just might.

You're just mad at me because
I found a better painter.

You and I both know that's

Don't be ridiculous.

Or is it that you know you've
lost your chance with me?

- Denton's half the painter I am.
- No. No, he is not.

And I am confident
he'll be much more a man.

You murdered Caswell just
like you murdered your husband.

Well, William, the result of you
considering Mr. Caswell's painting

36:08.541 --> 36:11.542
ghastly is that you didn't
look at it closely enough.

36:11.877 --> 36:15.036
It struck me when I
saw Mr. Denton's work.

36:15.277 --> 36:17.038
Can you see it now?

36:22.995 --> 36:25.740
Just that neither are particularly good.

36:25.804 --> 36:27.983
That Denton's a bloody copycat!

36:28.017 --> 36:29.903
Not that either of them are any good.

36:30.398 --> 36:32.693
You may think that, Inspector...

36:33.656 --> 36:35.456
But take a look at this.

36:35.790 --> 36:38.181
Julia! That may be evidence.

36:38.773 --> 36:41.239
I'm going to show you
that it is evidence.

36:41.472 --> 36:44.509
The thing I found appealing
about Mr. Caswell's work

36:44.523 --> 36:46.843
was his sense of scale and perspective.

36:47.151 --> 36:50.339
I did find his choice of tones
and colours a little garish.

36:50.352 --> 36:52.910
But when I saw Mr.
Denton's work at the gallery

36:52.962 --> 36:55.571
I was struck by the similarity.

36:55.783 --> 36:58.971
Well the Dragon Lady did say that
Mr. Caswell changed his style.

36:58.977 --> 37:01.285
It was the reason she
withdrew her patronage.

37:01.336 --> 37:03.585
He did more than change his style.

37:03.710 --> 37:06.164
After an oil is cured,
it's often finished

37:06.177 --> 37:08.740
with a copal varnish
that will never dissolve.

37:10.122 --> 37:13.538
Mr. Denton did that,
but Mr. Caswell did not.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.566
He stole Mr. Denton's
paintings and painted over them.

37:17.691 --> 37:21.436
He used Mr. Denton's inspiration
to create his landscapes.

37:21.561 --> 37:24.239
But Denton said all his
paintings were destroyed.

37:24.273 --> 37:26.942
Well, we know of at
least one that wasn't.

- Excellent work, Julia.
- Thank you.

I still don't think either
one of them is any good.

37:36.476 --> 37:38.236
Neither do I.

37:41.795 --> 37:44.793
- Sour grapes, Mr. Brackenreid?
- Hardly.

37:45.185 --> 37:47.466
Losing a patron of Belinda's quality,

37:47.498 --> 37:49.362
I'm sure, is no small financial loss.

- Then why?

We found this beside Mr. Caswell's body.

38:11.676 --> 38:14.118
I suppose my only question to you is

38:14.143 --> 38:16.767
when did you learn Mr.
Caswell burnt down your studio

38:16.788 --> 38:18.088
and stole your work?

38:18.127 --> 38:20.649
As a fellow artist, I can
understand why you killed him.

38:20.649 --> 38:21.672
I didn't.

38:22.042 --> 38:24.680
Both motive and
opportunity suggest you did.

38:25.641 --> 38:27.269
He did you wrong, sir.

38:29.272 --> 38:30.351
He did.

38:30.562 --> 38:32.140
And he deserved what he got.

38:34.115 --> 38:35.611
<i>All of them were jealous of my ability, </i>

38:35.632 --> 38:37.637
<i>but I never thought one of
them would go that far. </i>

38:38.567 --> 38:40.015
<i>With the ferocity of the fire,</i>

38:40.049 --> 38:42.017
I imagined that my
work was lost forever.

38:43.821 --> 38:44.984
I was wrong.

38:49.122 --> 38:50.464
<i>He would have never attained </i>

38:50.505 --> 38:52.840
<i>the heights that he did
without my... my guidance.</i>

38:52.907 --> 38:55.811
<i>Without my sense of
space and perspective.</i>

38:56.521 --> 38:58.346
They didn't see it, but I did.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.446
<i>There was no mistaking what I saw.</i>

39:11.328 --> 39:13.797
You can't just steal a man's soul
and expect to get away with it.

39:20.148 --> 39:22.729
- I do have to leave, Lewellyn.
- I know.

39:23.089 --> 39:25.017
- Watch your step.
- Ooh!

39:25.043 --> 39:27.660
As romantic as a kidnapping can be...

39:27.685 --> 39:31.700
I just want you to leave in
the style you are accustomed to.

39:31.734 --> 39:33.831
- You found it!
- I did indeed.

39:33.850 --> 39:36.035
Oh, this is so joyous.

39:36.619 --> 39:38.206
Thank you.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.051
Yes. I almost didn't give it to you.

39:40.090 --> 39:42.143
- I found it yesterday.
- Yesterday?

39:42.628 --> 39:44.057
And you didn't tell me?

39:44.280 --> 39:46.674
I thought if I hid it you would stay,

39:46.689 --> 39:48.309
but when I saw you ride up...

39:48.612 --> 39:49.640
Well,

39:49.959 --> 39:52.921
- I knew I couldn't keep you.
- No, you couldn't.

39:53.046 --> 39:55.269
Were you really gonna deny me my dream?

39:56.019 --> 39:59.096
I thought about it, but no.

40:00.825 --> 40:04.664
I would be lying if I didn't
say I'm sorely tempted to stay.

40:05.558 --> 40:07.730
But you can't.

40:09.420 --> 40:11.071
I want to finish this.

40:11.196 --> 40:13.450
- I have to finish this.
- Of course.

40:13.575 --> 40:18.232
And six months from now,
I will be done. So...

40:18.547 --> 40:20.224
if you would like,

40:20.507 --> 40:23.874
I do think a trip back
here would be a lot quicker.

40:25.461 --> 40:27.299
I would like that.

Oh, uh... Miss Newsome. Not tonight.
