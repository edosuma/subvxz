I think around 7th grade,

30:26.124 --> 30:28.460
I started to compare myself
to my friends.

15 pounds.

30:30.562 --> 30:31.830

growing,

30:31.897 --> 30:33.465

not eating as much

30:33.532 --> 30:36.368
because I hated the way
my stomach looked.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.437
Every day, I'd wake up and I'd
start off on a bad note,

30:38.503 --> 30:40.739

and I would just, like,

30:40.806 --> 30:43.041
you know, pinch my stomach
or, you know, like,

30:43.108 --> 30:45.043

my biggest weakness

to everyone else around me.
