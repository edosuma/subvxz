00:53.971 --> 00:55.894
You're up early! What's happening?

00:55.973 --> 00:59.318
It's a nightmare 'cause Dad won't listen
and I'm telling you, Mum's going mental.

00:59.434 --> 01:02.438
Swear to God, Martha, this is epic.
You got to get in there and stop him.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.899
- How do I do that?
- Tell Dad he can't bring her.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.776
Hold on, that's Leo. I'll call you back.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.157
Martha, if Mum and Dad
start to kick off,

01:10.237 --> 01:12.831
tell them I don't even want a party.
I didn't even ask for one.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.666
They can always give me
the money instead.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.660
Why do I have to tell them?
Why can't you?

01:16.743 --> 01:19.337
Hold on, that's Mum. I'll call you back.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.800
I don't mind your father
making a fool of himself in private,

01:23.875 --> 01:26.594
but this is Leo's 21st.
Everyone is going to be there,

01:26.670 --> 01:29.514
and the entire family
is going to look ridiculous.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.434
Mum, it's a party. I can't stop Dad
from bringing his girlfriend.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.230
Hold on, that's Dad. I'll call you back.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.146
Martha, now tell your mother.

01:40.225 --> 01:44.480
Leo is my son,
and I'm paying for half that party.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.736
I'm entitled to bring who I like.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.977
I know, but think
what it's going to look like for Mum

01:49.026 --> 01:50.448
if you're standing there with Annalise.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.996
What's wrong with Annalise?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.869
Is that Martha? Say hi!

01:54.948 --> 01:56.621
Hi, Martha! Hi!

01:56.700 --> 01:57.952
Hi, Annalise.

01:58.035 --> 02:01.164
Big kiss! Lots of love!
See you at the party, babes!

02:01.246 --> 02:03.590
Now take me shopping, big boy.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.132
Like so!

02:09.755 --> 02:10.881
See?

02:27.189 --> 02:29.066
Oi! Watch it, mate!

02:53.840 --> 02:56.263
I was all right till this morning,
and then...

02:56.385 --> 02:59.434
I don't know, I woke up
and I felt all dizzy again.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.312
It was worse than when I came in.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.150
Pulse is slightly thready.

03:04.267 --> 03:08.317
Well, let's see what Britain's finest
might suggest. Any ideas, Morgenstern?

03:08.522 --> 03:12.026
Er, dizziness could be
a sign of early onset diabetes.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.828
Hardly early onset,
if you'll forgive me, Miss Finnegan.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.871
Any more ideas? Swales?

03:16.947 --> 03:18.039
Urn...

03:18.115 --> 03:21.619
- Could recommend a CT scan.
- And spend all our money?

03:21.743 --> 03:22.790
Jones?

03:22.869 --> 03:25.622
We could take bloods
and check for Méniére's disease.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.216
Or we could simply ask the patient.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.714
What did you have for dinner last night?

03:30.794 --> 03:31.966
I had salad.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.047
- And the night before?
- Salad, again.

03:34.131 --> 03:39.058
And salad every night for the past week,
contrary to my instructions.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.515
A salt deficiency, that's all.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.396
Simple, honest salt.

03:45.475 --> 03:49.025
Hippocrates himself
expounded on the virtues of salt.

03:49.104 --> 03:52.654
Recommended the inhalation of steam
from sea water.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.618
Though no doubt
if he'd been afflicted with my students,

03:55.694 --> 03:58.823
his oaths might have been
rather more colourful.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.753
Now then, Mr Smith, a very good morning
to you. How are you today?

04:08.832 --> 04:11.130
Oh, not so bad.
Still a bit, you know... Blah.

04:11.209 --> 04:15.009
John Smith, admitted yesterday
with severe abdominal pains.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.762
Jones, why don't you see
what you can find? Amaze me.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.641
It wasn't very clever
running around outside, was it?

04:21.720 --> 04:24.143
- Sorry?
- On Chancellor Street, this morning.

04:24.222 --> 04:28.227
- Came up to me and took your tie off.
- Really? What did I do that for?

04:28.310 --> 04:29.732
I don't know, you just did.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.860
Not me. I was here in bed.
Ask the nurses.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.317
Well, that's weird
'cause it looked like you.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.324
- Have you got a brother?
- No, not any more. just me.

04:38.403 --> 04:42.954
As time passes and I grow ever more
infirm and weary, Miss Jones...

04:43.033 --> 04:44.376
Sorry.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.499
Right.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.722
I weep for future generations.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.888
Are you having trouble
locating the heart, Miss Jones?

05:00.967 --> 05:05.143
Urn, I don't know. Stomach cramps?

05:05.222 --> 05:08.476
That is a symptom, not a diagnosis.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.811
And you rather failed basic techniques

05:10.894 --> 05:14.148
by not consulting first
with the patient's chart.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.484
That happened to me this morning.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.910
I had the same thing on the door handle.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.906
- And me, in the lift.
- Well, it's only to be expected.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.706
There's a thunderstorm moving in

05:23.824 --> 05:26.577
and lightning is a form
of static electricity,

05:26.660 --> 05:29.664
as was first proven by... Anyone?

05:29.746 --> 05:31.589
Benjamin Franklin.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.166
Correct.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.924
My mate, Ben. That was a day and a half.
I got rope burns off that kite.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.549
- And then I got soaked.
- Quite.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.844
And then I got electrocuted!

05:39.923 --> 05:41.516
Moving on.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.265
I think perhaps a visit
from psychiatric.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.514
And next, we have Mr...

05:51.142 --> 05:54.112
No, listen, I've worked out a plan.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.233
We tell Annalise that the buffet tonight
is 100% carbohydrate,

05:57.315 --> 05:59.488
and she won't turn up.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.195
I wish you'd take this seriously.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.373
That's our inheritance
she's spending on fake tan.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.699
Tell you what, I'm not that far away.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.659
I'll meet you for a sandwich,
we can draw up a battle plan.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.791
What, in this weather?
I'm not going out, it's pouring down.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.919
It's not raining here.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.470
God, that's weird.
It's raining right on top of you.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.550
- I can see it, but it's dry where I am.
- Well, you just got lucky.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.681
No, but it's like in cartoons,
when a man's got a cloud over his head.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.851
Yeah, but listen,
I'll tell you what we do...

06:31.933 --> 06:35.312
We tell Dad and Annalise
to get there early, about 7:30,

06:35.395 --> 06:37.363
and we tell Leo to get there
at the same time

06:37.480 --> 06:38.960
so we can do all that birthday stuff.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.155
We tell Mum to get there
for about 8:50-9:00,

06:41.276 --> 06:44.576
then that gives me time
to have a word with Annalise and...

06:44.654 --> 06:46.156
What?

06:46.281 --> 06:48.659
- The rain.
- It's only rain.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.956
Martha, have you seen the rain?

06:51.077 --> 06:52.875
Why is everyone fussing about rain?

06:52.996 --> 06:54.248
It's going UP-

06:54.331 --> 06:56.333
The rain is going up.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.043
What the hell was that?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.161
Are you all right?

07:33.244 --> 07:36.088
I think so, yeah.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.675
It felt like an earthquake or...

07:38.750 --> 07:41.253
Martha, it's night.

07:42.337 --> 07:46.467
- But it was lunch time...
- It's not night.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.395
But it's got to be. It's dark.

07:51.346 --> 07:54.350
- We're on the moon!
- Can't be.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.899
We're on the moon.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.192
We're on the bloody moon.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.574
I'm sorry, miss, no.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.117
Oh, my God.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.168
Martha? Martha, can you hear me?

09:00.331 --> 09:01.583
Martha?

09:07.297 --> 09:09.550
Somebody help! Somebody help me!

09:26.316 --> 09:29.160
- Have you seen...
- I'm sorry, I can't.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.411
All right now, everyone, back to bed.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.994
We've got an emergency,
but we'll sort it out. Don't worry.

09:38.036 --> 09:41.506
It's real. It's really real.

09:42.499 --> 09:46.049
- Hold on.
- Don't! We'll lose all the air!

09:46.211 --> 09:49.431
But they're not exactly airtight.
If the air was gonna get sucked out,

09:49.506 --> 09:51.634
it would've happened straightaway,
but it didn't.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.139
- So, how come?
- Very good point!

09:54.219 --> 09:56.847
- Brilliant, in fact. What was your name?
- Martha.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.978
And it was Jones, wasn't it?

09:59.057 --> 10:02.027
Well, Martha Jones, question is,
how are we still breathing?

10:02.143 --> 10:03.360
We can't be!

10:03.436 --> 10:04.904
Obviously we are so don't waste my time.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.607
Martha, what have we got? Is there
a balcony on this ﬂoor, or a veranda?

10:07.690 --> 10:10.034
By the patients' lounge, yeah.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.533
- You fancy going out?
- Okay.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.032
- We might die.
- We might not.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.997
Good. Come on.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.249
Not her, she'd hold us up.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.773
We've got air.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.911
- How does that work?
- Just be glad it does.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.539
I've got a party tonight.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.670
It's my brother's 21st.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.758
My mother's gonna be really... Really...

11:11.880 --> 11:13.427
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.632
- Sure?
- Yeah.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.593
- Do you want to go back in?
- No way.

11:16.718 --> 11:21.098
I mean, we could die any minute,
but all the same, it's beautiful.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.353
Do you think?

11:22.432 --> 11:26.437
How many people want to go to the moon?
And here we are.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.315
Standing in the Earth light.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.613
What do you think happened?

11:33.276 --> 11:34.994
What do you think?

11:36.279 --> 11:39.078
Extraterrestrial. It's got to be.

11:39.157 --> 11:43.128
I don't know, a few years ago that
would've sounded mad, but these days...

11:43.203 --> 11:48.130
That spaceship flying into Big Ben.
Christmas. Those Cybermen things.

11:51.628 --> 11:54.347
I had a cousin, Adeola.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.600
She worked at Canary Wharf.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.436
She never came home.

12:02.013 --> 12:04.107
I'm sorry.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.650
Yeah.

12:06.768 --> 12:11.023
I was there, in the battle. It was...

12:15.693 --> 12:18.572
I promise you, Mr Smith,
we will find a way out.

12:18.655 --> 12:21.204
If we can travel to the moon,
then we can travel back.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.454
There's got to be a way.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.831
It's not Smith. That's not my real name.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.505
- Who are you, then?
- I'm the Doctor.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.083
Me, too, if I ever pass my exams.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.043
What is it then, Dr Smith?

12:32.126 --> 12:35.426
- Just the Doctor.
- How do you mean, just the Doctor?

12:35.964 --> 12:38.012
Just the Doctor.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.560
- What, people call you "the Doctor"?
- Yeah.

12:40.677 --> 12:45.399
Well, I'm not. Far as I'm concerned,
you've got to earn that title.

12:45.515 --> 12:48.610
Well, I'd better make a start, then.
Let's have a look.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.983
There must be some sort of...

12:53.106 --> 12:54.779
Force-field.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.576
Keeping the air in.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.698
But if that's like a bubble
sealing us in,

13:00.780 --> 13:03.374
that means this is the only air
we've got.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.794
- What happens when it runs out?
- How many people in this hospital?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.542
Don't know, a thousand?

13:08.621 --> 13:13.252
- One thousand people, suffocating.
- Why would anyone do that?

13:15.253 --> 13:16.880
Heads up! Ask him yourself.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.569
Aliens.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.620
That's aliens!

14:23.988 --> 14:25.831
Real, proper aliens.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.455
Judoon.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.015
Mr Stoker?

14:47.095 --> 14:50.941
I'm sorry, I didn't know
who else to ask, but can you help me?

14:51.015 --> 14:53.689
I think we've gone
beyond aspirin, Miss...

14:53.768 --> 14:54.894
Finnegan.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.854
Names! What are names now

14:56.938 --> 15:00.568
when something unnameable
is marching towards us across the moon?

15:00.650 --> 15:04.029
Two more years, I thought. Two more
years and then retire to Florida.

15:04.153 --> 15:08.158
But there is Florida, in the sky.
I can see it.

15:08.241 --> 15:13.338
My daughter. She's still in university.
I am never going to see her again.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.963
- But I need help, Mr Stoker.
- I can't do anything!

15:17.041 --> 15:18.759
Oh, I think you can.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.090
What do you two want?
It's a bit late to sign for anything.

15:24.173 --> 15:28.303
These are my lovely boys.
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.265
- I'm sorry?
- You see, there are great tests to come,

15:31.347 --> 15:33.224
and terrible deeds.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.022
Some of them my own.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.605
But if I'm to survive this, I need you.

15:38.688 --> 15:42.534
- What are you talking about?
- Blood. Specifically, yours.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.408
What are you doing?

15:46.737 --> 15:48.205
What are you doing?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.041
Will you let go of me!
What the hell? Let go!

15:50.116 --> 15:52.585
You see, I was only salt deficient

15:52.660 --> 15:55.630
because I'm so very good
at absorbing it.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.504
But now I need fire in my veins.

15:58.583 --> 16:03.555
And who better than a consultant,
with blood full of salty fats

16:03.629 --> 16:08.556
and vintage wines
and all those Michelin star sauces?

16:09.427 --> 16:11.020
Who are you?

16:11.095 --> 16:14.474
Oh, I'm a survivor, Mr Stoker.

16:14.557 --> 16:15.934
At any cost.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.565
Look!

16:20.771 --> 16:23.069
I've even brought a straw.

17:19.704 --> 17:23.960
Bo! Sco! F0! Do! No!
Kro! Blo! Co! Sho! R0!

17:30.633 --> 17:34.683
We are citizens of planet Earth.
We welcome you in peace.

17:39.267 --> 17:42.191
Please don't hurt me. I was just trying
to help, I'm sorry. Don't hurt me.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.484
Please don't hurt me.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.734
Please don't hurt me. I was just trying
to help, I'm sorry. Don't hurt me.

17:47.817 --> 17:48.943
Please don't hurt me.

17:49.026 --> 17:53.156
Language assimilated.
Designation, Earth English.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.249
You will be catalogued.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.666
Category, human.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.719
Catalogue all suspects.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.020
Aw, look down there,
you've got a little shop.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.854
- I like a little shop.
- Never mind that. What are Judoon?

18:23.936 --> 18:26.780
They're like police.
Well, police-for-hire.

18:26.856 --> 18:30.406
- They're more like interplanetary thugs.
- And they brought us to the moon?

18:30.484 --> 18:32.327
Neutral territory.
According to Galactic Law,

18:32.445 --> 18:35.699
they've got no jurisdiction
over the Earth so they isolated it.

18:35.781 --> 18:40.412
That rain and lightning, that was them
using an H20 Scoop.

18:40.536 --> 18:44.666
Why are you on about, Galactic Law?
I mean, where did you get that from?

18:48.044 --> 18:49.296
Human.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.006
If they're police, are we under arrest?

18:52.089 --> 18:54.387
Are we trespassing on the moon
or something?

18:54.467 --> 18:58.768
No, but I like that! Good thinking.
No, wish it were that simple.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.768
They're making a catalogue, that means
they're after something non-human,

19:01.849 --> 19:03.647
which is very bad news for me.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.569
Why?

19:07.938 --> 19:10.316
Oh, you're kidding me?

19:10.399 --> 19:12.367
Don't be ridiculous.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.454
Stop looking at me like that.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.244
Come on, then.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.536
Troop 5, ﬂoor one.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.542
Troop 6, floor two.

19:23.621 --> 19:27.171
Identify humans
and find the transgressor.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.751
Find it!

19:40.262 --> 19:41.764
Prepare to be catalogued!

19:41.847 --> 19:44.600
Do what they say. All they want to do
is shine this light thing.

19:44.684 --> 19:48.188
It's all right, they're not
going to hurt us. just listen to them.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.321
Witness the crime.

19:56.404 --> 20:00.159
Charge, physical assault. Plea, guilty.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.618
Sentence, execution.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.542
You didn't have to do that.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.468
Justice is swift.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.893
They've reached the third floor.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.097
- What's that thing?
- Sonic screwdriver.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.432
Well, if you're not
going to answer me properly.

20:24.515 --> 20:27.394
No, really, it is!
It's a screwdriver and it's... sonic.

20:27.476 --> 20:28.773
Look.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.568
What else have you got? A laser spanner?

20:31.647 --> 20:34.321
I did, but it was stolen
by Emily Pankhurst. Cheeky woman.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.619
What's wrong with this computer?

20:36.694 --> 20:39.197
Judoon must have locked it down.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.041
Judoon platoon upon the moon.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.440
I was just travelling past,
I swear, I was just wandering.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.205
I wasn't looking for trouble.
Honestly, I wasn't.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.409
But I noticed these plasma coils
around the hospital.

20:49.457 --> 20:52.210
That lightning, that's a plasma coil,
it's been building up for two days now.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.257
So I checked in, I thought
something was going on inside.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.964
Turns out the plasma coils
were the Judoon up above.

20:57.047 --> 21:00.597
- What are they looking for?
- Something that looks human, but isn't.

21:00.718 --> 21:04.018
- Like you, apparently.
- Like me, but not me.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.270
- Haven't they got a photo?
- Might be a shape-changer.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.023
Whatever it is, can't you just
leave the Judoon to find it?

21:10.102 --> 21:12.776
If they declare the hospital guilty
of harbouring a fugitive,

21:12.897 --> 21:14.524
they'll sentence it to execution.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.200
- All of us?
- Oh, yes.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.820
But if I can find
this thing first... Oh!

21:18.903 --> 21:21.281
Do you see?
They're thick. Judoon are thick.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.240
They are so completely thick,
they've wiped the records!

21:23.324 --> 21:24.450
Oh, that's clever.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.501
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know.

21:26.577 --> 21:29.296
Say, any patient admitted
in the past week with unusual symptoms.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.964
Maybe there's a backup.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.965
Just keep working, I'll go
and ask Mr Stoker. He might know.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.218
Mr Stoker...

21:50.351 --> 21:52.069
Kill her!

21:53.729 --> 21:55.481
- I've restored the backup.
- I found her!

21:55.564 --> 21:57.532
You did what?

21:57.608 --> 21:58.825
Run!

22:37.648 --> 22:39.241
Quick!

22:47.950 --> 22:49.827
When I say "now", press the button.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.254
- But I don't know which one.
- Then find out!

23:08.971 --> 23:10.223
NOW!

23:21.984 --> 23:24.237
What did you do?

23:24.320 --> 23:28.200
Increased the radiation by 5,000%.
Killed him dead.

23:28.282 --> 23:31.832
- But isn't that gonna kill you?
- Nah, it's only roentgen radiation.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.875
We used to play with roentgen bricks
in the nursery.

23:33.954 --> 23:37.049
It's safe for you to come out.
I've absorbed it all.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.502
All I need to do is expel it.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.847
See, if I concentrate,

23:43.923 --> 23:47.769
shift the radiation out of my body
and into one spot.

23:49.178 --> 23:51.397
Say, my left shoe.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.766
Here we go. Here we go. Easy does it.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.695
Out, out, out, out, out, out, out...

23:57.770 --> 23:59.147
Ow, ow, ow!

23:59.229 --> 24:02.449
Itches, itches, itches, itches!

24:03.359 --> 24:05.202
Hold on.

24:05.653 --> 24:08.623
- Done!
- You're completely mad.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.291
You're right, I look daft with one shoe.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.710
Barefoot on the moon!

24:17.915 --> 24:21.044
So what is that thing?
And where's it from, Planet Zovirax?

24:21.126 --> 24:24.551
It's just a Slab. They're called Slabs.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.800
Basic slave drones, you see.

24:26.882 --> 24:30.978
Solid leather all the way through.
Someone has got one hell of a fetish.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.272
But it was that woman, Miss Finnegan.

24:33.347 --> 24:36.226
It was working for her,
just like a servant.

24:36.350 --> 24:38.978
- My sonic screwdriver!
- She was one of the patients, but...

24:39.061 --> 24:40.563
Burnt out my sonic screwdriver!

24:40.646 --> 24:42.865
She had this straw,
like some sort of vampire.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.693
- I love my sonic screwdriver!
- Doctor!

24:46.485 --> 24:48.158
Sorry.

24:48.237 --> 24:50.865
- You called me Doctor.
- Anyway...

24:50.948 --> 24:54.669
Miss Finnegan is the alien.
She was drinking Mr Stoker's blood.

24:54.743 --> 24:58.498
Funny time to take a snack.
You'd think she'd be hiding.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.378
Unless... No!

25:01.166 --> 25:03.464
Yes! That's it! Wait a minute.

25:03.544 --> 25:06.514
Yes! Shape-changer,
internal shape-changer!

25:06.588 --> 25:08.682
She wasn't drinking blood,
she was assimilating it.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.138
Prepare to be catalogued!

25:20.310 --> 25:21.562
Human.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.406
If she can assimilate Mr Stoker's blood,
mimic the biology,

25:28.485 --> 25:30.829
she'll register as human.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.574
We've got to find her
and show the Judoon. Come on!

25:34.283 --> 25:35.535
Human.

25:58.307 --> 26:01.732
That's the thing about Slabs.
They always travel in pairs.

26:02.269 --> 26:05.318
- What about you?
- What about me what?

26:05.439 --> 26:08.818
Haven't you got backup?
You must have a partner or something.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.327
Humans! We're stuck on the moon,
running out of air,

26:14.448 --> 26:16.371
with Judoon and a bloodsucking criminal,

26:16.450 --> 26:18.919
and you're asking personal questions.
Come on.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.667
I like that. "Humans!"

26:20.788 --> 26:23.712
I'm still not convinced you're an alien.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.759
Non-human!

26:25.834 --> 26:28.178
- Oh, my God, you really are!
- And again.

26:48.065 --> 26:50.534
They've done this floor. Come on.

26:52.027 --> 26:54.780
The Judoon are logical
and just a little bit thick.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.743
They won't go back to check a ﬂoor
they've checked already. If we're lucky.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.453
How much oxygen is there?

27:00.536 --> 27:04.291
Not enough for all these people.
We're gonna run out.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.467
How you feeling? You all right?

27:06.542 --> 27:08.920
- Running on adrenalin.
- Welcome to my world.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.421
What about the Judoon?

27:10.546 --> 27:13.049
Great big lung reserves.
It won't slow them down.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.222
- Where's Mr Stoker's office?
- It's this way.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.064
She's gone. She was here.

27:30.232 --> 27:33.202
Drained him dry. Every last drop.

27:33.318 --> 27:36.618
- I was right, she's a Plasmavore.
- What's she doing on Earth?

27:36.738 --> 27:40.993
Hiding, on the run.
Like Ronald Biggs in Rio de Janeiro.

27:41.076 --> 27:44.125
What's she doing now?
She's still not safe.

27:44.246 --> 27:46.044
The Judoon could execute us all.
Come on.

27:46.123 --> 27:47.875
Wait a minute.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.595
Think, think, think.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.978
If I was a wanted Plasmavore
surrounded by police, what would I do?

28:03.098 --> 28:06.318
Oh! She's as clever as me.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.610
Almost.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.440
Find the non-human! Execute!

28:11.523 --> 28:13.571
Martha, stay here.
I need time, you've got to hold them up.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.527
- How do I do that?
- Just forgive me for this.

28:15.611 --> 28:19.536
It could save a thousand lives and
it means nothing. Honestly, nothing.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.675
That was nothing?

28:57.152 --> 28:59.154
Have you seen? There are these things!

28:59.238 --> 29:01.866
These great, big space rhino things.

29:01.949 --> 29:05.419
I mean, rhinos from space,
and we're on the moon!

29:05.494 --> 29:07.747
Great, big space rhinos with guns!
On the moon!

29:07.829 --> 29:09.957
I only came in for my bunions! Look!

29:10.040 --> 29:12.293
All fixed now, perfectly good treatment,
the nurses were lovely.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.470
I said to my wife,
"I'd recommend this place to anyone."

29:14.544 --> 29:18.265
But then we end up on the moon!
And did I mention the rhinos?

29:18.340 --> 29:19.887
Hold him.

29:24.638 --> 29:27.482
Find the non-human! Execute!

29:33.188 --> 29:35.816
Now, listen,
I know who you're looking for.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.618
She's this woman.
She calls herself Florence.

29:39.861 --> 29:40.908
Human.

29:40.988 --> 29:43.662
Wait. Non-human trace suspected.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.993
Non-human element confirmed.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.291
Authorise full scan.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.298
What are you?

29:52.541 --> 29:54.418
What are you?

29:55.127 --> 29:59.132
That big machine thing,
is it supposed to be making that noise?

29:59.214 --> 30:00.682
You wouldn't understand.

30:00.799 --> 30:04.599
But isn't that
a magnetic resonance imaging thing?

30:04.678 --> 30:08.148
Like a ginormous sort of a magnet?
I did Magnetics GCSE.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.066
Well, I failed, but all the same.

30:10.142 --> 30:13.897
A magnet with its setting
now increased to 50,000 tesla.

30:14.021 --> 30:15.989
Ooh, that's a bit strong, isn't it?

30:16.064 --> 30:17.907
It'll send out a magnetic pulse

30:18.025 --> 30:21.154
that'll fry the brainstems
of every living thing

30:21.236 --> 30:24.410
within 250,000 miles.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.372
Except for me. Safe in this room.

30:27.451 --> 30:30.921
But hold on, hold on.
I did Geography GCSE, I passed that one.

30:31.038 --> 30:32.915
Doesn't that distance include the Earth?

30:32.998 --> 30:36.172
Only the side facing the moon.
The other half will survive.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.719
Call it my little gift.

30:37.794 --> 30:40.138
Sorry, you'll have to excuse me,
I'm a little bit out of my depth.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.936
I've spent the past 15 years
working as a postman. Hence the bunion.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.138
Why would you do that?

30:44.259 --> 30:48.935
With everyone dead, the Judoon ships
will be mine to make my escape.

30:49.056 --> 30:52.276
No, that's weird. You're talking
like you're some sort of an alien.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.477
Quite so.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.777
- No!
- Oh, yes.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.901
- You're joshing me!
- I am not.

30:57.022 --> 31:00.196
I'm talking to an alien, in a hospital?

31:00.275 --> 31:02.118
What, has this place got
an ET department?

31:02.194 --> 31:06.074
It's the perfect hiding place. Blood
banks downstairs for a midnight feast.

31:06.156 --> 31:09.000
And all this equipment
ready to arm myself with

31:09.076 --> 31:11.170
should the police come looking.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.163
So, those rhinos,
they're looking for you!

31:13.288 --> 31:17.259
Yes. But I'm hidden.

31:17.834 --> 31:22.715
Oh, right. Maybe that's why
they're increasing their scans.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.596
They're doing what?

31:24.716 --> 31:27.185
Big Chief Rhino boy, he said,
"No sign of a non-human."

31:27.302 --> 31:30.647
"We must increase our scans
up to setting two."

31:30.722 --> 31:33.396
- Then I must assimilate again.
- What does that mean?

31:33.475 --> 31:35.773
I must appear to be human.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.652
Well, you're welcome to come home
and meet the wife. She'd be honoured.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.985
We can have cake.

31:40.065 --> 31:43.239
Why should I have cake?
I've got my little straw.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.906
That's nice. Milkshake? I like banana.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.911
You're quite the funny man.

31:48.990 --> 31:53.336
And yet, I think, laughing on purpose
at the darkness.

31:53.995 --> 31:57.295
I think it's time you found some peace.
Steady him.

32:00.836 --> 32:04.932
- What are you doing?
- I'm afraid this is going to hurt.

32:05.006 --> 32:09.352
But if it's any consolation,
the dead don't tend to remember.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.978
Confirm. Human.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.231
Traces of facial contact with non-human.

32:17.310 --> 32:18.983
Continue the search!

32:19.062 --> 32:21.190
- You will need this.
- What's that for?

32:21.273 --> 32:22.900
Compensation.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.839
Now, see what you've done?
This poor man just died of fright.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.264
Scan him!

32:50.177 --> 32:51.724
Confirmation, deceased.

32:51.845 --> 32:54.439
No, he can't be!
Let me through. Let me see him.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.479
Stop. Case closed.

32:56.558 --> 32:58.310
But it was her!

32:58.393 --> 33:01.112
She killed him. She did it.
She murdered him!

33:01.229 --> 33:05.075
Judoon have no authority
over human crime.

33:05.150 --> 33:08.450
- But she's not human!
- Oh, but I am. I've been catalogued.

33:08.570 --> 33:10.743
But she's not. She assim...

33:11.198 --> 33:13.075
Wait a minute.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.420
You drank his blood? The Doctor's blood!

33:18.413 --> 33:20.962
Oh, I don't mind. Scan all you like.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.253
- Non-human!
- But... What?

33:24.336 --> 33:26.430
Confirm analysis.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.675
Oh, but there's a mistake, surely.
I'm human.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.305
I'm as human as they come.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.804
He gave his life so they'd find you.

33:33.887 --> 33:37.266
Confirm, Plasmavore.
Charged with the crime

33:37.349 --> 33:41.070
of murdering the Child Princess
of Padrivole Regency Nine.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.363
Well, she deserved it!

33:43.438 --> 33:47.113
Those pink cheeks and those blonde curls
and that simpering voice.

33:47.234 --> 33:50.909
She was begging for the bite
of a Plasmavore!

33:50.987 --> 33:54.708
- Then you confess?
- Confess? I'm proud of it!

33:54.783 --> 33:56.660
Slab, stop them!

34:01.665 --> 34:04.464
Verdict, guilty. Sentence, execution.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.428
Enjoy your victory, Judoon.

34:11.507 --> 34:15.138
Because you're going to burn with me!
Burn in hell!

34:22.936 --> 34:24.734
Case closed.

34:24.813 --> 34:27.065
But what did she mean, burn with me?

34:27.148 --> 34:30.493
The scanner shouldn't be doing that.
She's done something.

34:34.864 --> 34:39.165
Scans detect lethal acceleration
of mono-magnetic pulse.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.996
Well, do something! Stop it!

34:42.121 --> 34:46.092
Our jurisdiction has ended.
Judoon will evacuate.

34:46.167 --> 34:49.467
What? You can't just leave it!
What's it gonna do?

34:49.545 --> 34:51.514
All units withdraw!

35:05.103 --> 35:08.027
What about the air?
We're running out of air.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.747
You can't go!

35:20.827 --> 35:23.922
That thing's gonna explode,
and it's your fault!

35:31.838 --> 35:34.887
One, two, three, four, five.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.895
One, two, three, four, five.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.189
Two hearts!

35:44.059 --> 35:47.063
One, two, three, four, five.

35:48.396 --> 35:51.240
One, two, three, four, five.

36:05.747 --> 36:07.374
The scanner...

36:07.749 --> 36:09.626
She did something.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.546
Oh! The sonic!

37:42.469 --> 37:46.019
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, please.

37:46.139 --> 37:48.517
Come on, Judoon, reverse it.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.529
It's raining, Martha!

37:52.645 --> 37:54.568
It's raining on the moon.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.793
Pass me the first aid kit.

38:18.046 --> 38:21.141
I said I represent the human race.

38:21.216 --> 38:24.220
I told them, you can't do that.
I said...

38:24.344 --> 38:27.564
Martha! Oh, my God,
I thought you were dead.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.809
What happened? It was so weird!

38:30.892 --> 38:33.520
The police wouldn't say, they didn't
have a clue. I tried phoning.

38:33.603 --> 38:36.402
Mum's on her way, but she can't get
through. They've closed off the roads.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.775
There's thousands of people
trying to get in.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.234
The whole city's come to a halt.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.491
And Dad phoned, it's on the news
and everything. He was crying.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.743
Oh, my God, I've been a mess.

38:44.864 --> 38:49.119
But what happened? I mean,
what really happened? Where were you?

38:49.202 --> 38:50.920
Eyewitness reports

38:50.995 --> 38:52.915
from the Royal Hope Hospital
continue to pour in,

38:52.956 --> 38:55.254
and all seem to be
remarkably consistent.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.212
This from medical student
Oliver Morgenstern.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.384
I was there.

39:00.463 --> 39:05.139
I saw it happen
and I fee! unique! y privileged.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.854
I looked out at the surface of the moon.

39:07.929 --> 39:14.027
I saw the Earth suspended in space,
and it all just proves Mr Saxon right.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.196
We 're not alone in the universe.

39:16.312 --> 39:20.783
There's life out there.
Wild and extraordinary life.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.533
I am not staying in there
to be insulted!

39:23.653 --> 39:26.452
She didn't mean it, sweetheart.
She was just saying you look healthy.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.374
No, I did not. I said orange.

39:28.449 --> 39:31.202
Clive, that woman is disrespecting me.
She's never liked me.

39:31.286 --> 39:34.130
Oh, I can't think why,
after you stole my husband!

39:34.247 --> 39:37.000
I was seduced!
I'm entirely innocent. Tell her, babes!

39:37.125 --> 39:38.593
And then she has a go at Martha,

39:38.668 --> 39:40.466
practically accused her
of making the whole thing up.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.673
Mum, I don't mind. just leave it.

39:42.797 --> 39:45.141
Oh, "I've been to the moon." As if!

39:45.216 --> 39:47.310
They were drugged.
It said so on the news.

39:47.385 --> 39:51.106
Since when did you watch the news?
You can't handle Ouizmania.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.433
Annalise started it.
She did, I heard her.

39:53.516 --> 39:55.860
- Tish, don't make it worse.
- Come off it, Leo.

39:55.977 --> 39:58.321
What did she buy you? Soap!
A 75 pence soap!

39:58.396 --> 40:00.148
I'm never talking to your family again!

40:00.231 --> 40:02.825
- Stay! Have a nice party!
- Don't you dare!

40:02.942 --> 40:05.661
- I'm putting my foot down!
- Make a fool of yourself!

40:05.737 --> 40:07.660
This is me, putting my foot down!

40:07.780 --> 40:11.159
God knows you've been doing it
for the last 25 years. Why stop now?

40:11.284 --> 40:14.254
[Mum, don't. I asked the D]
and he's playing that song later...

40:51.366 --> 40:53.664
I went to the moon today.

40:53.743 --> 40:56.337
Bit more peaceful than down here.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.131
You never even told me who you are.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.629
The Doctor.

41:00.708 --> 41:04.554
But what sort of species?
It's not every day I get to ask that.

41:04.671 --> 41:06.173
I'm a Time Lord.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.426
Right. Not pompous at all, then.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.224
I just thought,

41:12.345 --> 41:15.690
since you saved my life and
I've got a brand-new sonic screwdriver

41:15.765 --> 41:17.938
which needs road-testing,

41:18.059 --> 41:20.107
you might fancy a trip.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.905
What, into space?

41:23.022 --> 41:25.571
I can't, I've got exams.
I've got things to do.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.950
I have to go into town first thing and
pay the rent. I got my family going mad.

41:29.028 --> 41:33.329
If it helps,
I can travel in time as well.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.081
- Get out of here.
- I can!

41:35.201 --> 41:38.796
- Come on now, that is going too far.
- I'll prove it.

42:05.648 --> 42:06.945
Told you!

42:07.025 --> 42:10.495
No, but... That was this morning.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.789
But... Did you...

42:12.864 --> 42:15.538
Oh, my God, you can travel in time!

42:15.616 --> 42:17.539
But hold on,
if you could see me this morning,

42:17.618 --> 42:20.121
why didn't you tell me
not to go into work?

42:20.204 --> 42:23.708
Crossing into established events
is strictly forbidden.

42:23.791 --> 42:26.214
Except for cheap tricks.

42:26.294 --> 42:28.137
And that's your spaceship?

42:28.212 --> 42:30.214
It's called the Tardis.

42:30.298 --> 42:33.097
Time And Relative Dimension In Space.

42:33.176 --> 42:35.895
Your spaceship's made of wood.

42:35.970 --> 42:39.099
There's not much room,
we'd be a bit intimate.

42:40.641 --> 42:42.188
Take a look.

42:50.777 --> 42:52.825
No, no, no...

42:53.946 --> 42:55.823
But it's just a box.

42:56.866 --> 42:58.709
But it's huge!

42:58.785 --> 43:00.503
How does it do that?

43:00.620 --> 43:02.668
It's wood!

43:02.789 --> 43:05.759
It's like a box
with that room just crammed in.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.633
It's bigger on the inside!

43:09.712 --> 43:11.806
Is it? I hadn't noticed.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.847
All right then, let's get going.

43:15.968 --> 43:18.517
But is there a crew?

43:18.638 --> 43:21.266
Like a navigator and stuff?
Where is everyone?

43:21.349 --> 43:23.477
Just me.

43:23.559 --> 43:24.856
All on your own?

43:24.977 --> 43:27.571
Well, sometimes I have guests.

43:27.688 --> 43:29.690
I mean, some friends
travelling alongside me.

43:29.816 --> 43:31.614
I had... It was recently...

43:31.692 --> 43:33.615
Friend of mine.

43:33.736 --> 43:36.831
Rose, her name was. Rose and...

43:38.199 --> 43:40.543
We were together. Anyway...

43:40.660 --> 43:41.752
Where is she now?

43:41.869 --> 43:44.588
With her family.
Happy. She's fine, she's...

43:44.705 --> 43:47.299
- Not that you're replacing her!
- Never said I was.

43:47.375 --> 43:51.505
Just one trip. To say thanks.
You get one trip then back home.

43:52.088 --> 43:54.182
I'd rather be on my own.

43:56.634 --> 43:59.057
Well, you're the one that kissed me.

43:59.178 --> 44:01.431
That was a genetic transfer.

44:03.391 --> 44:06.861
- And if you will wear a tight suit...
- Now, don't.

44:06.936 --> 44:10.907
And then travel all the way across
the universe just to ask me on a date.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.279
Stop it!

44:13.234 --> 44:16.033
For the record,
I'm not remotely interested.

44:16.737 --> 44:18.910
I only go for humans.

44:20.324 --> 44:21.496
Good!

44:21.576 --> 44:24.955
Now then, close down
the Gravitic Anomalyser.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.081
Fire up the Helmic Regulator.

44:27.165 --> 44:30.419
And finally, the handbrake.

44:32.712 --> 44:33.884
Ready?

44:34.005 --> 44:35.507
No.

44:35.631 --> 44:37.304
Off We go!

44:39.802 --> 44:42.396
Blimey! It's a bit bumpy!

44:42.471 --> 44:44.724
Welcome aboard, Miss Jones.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.728
It's my pleasure, Mr Smith.

44:58.321 --> 45:01.871
The Globe Theatre,
containing the man himself.

45:01.949 --> 45:04.202
Shut your big, fat mouths!

45:04.285 --> 45:06.708
- Mr Shakespeare, isn't it?
- No autographs.

45:06.787 --> 45:09.210
Love's Labour's Won
will never be played.

45:09.290 --> 45:11.543
Upon this night the work is done.

45:11.626 --> 45:12.752
Witchcraft.

45:14.128 --> 45:15.550
Impossible!

45:15.630 --> 45:17.507
Hey, nonny, nonny!

45:17.632 --> 45:18.975
No!

45:19.091 --> 45:20.809
The entire future
of the human race,

45:20.927 --> 45:24.522
it ends right now, in 7599,
if we don't stop it.

45:24.597 --> 45:25.723
By-da-boom-ba!

45:25.806 --> 45:27.558
That's quite good.
