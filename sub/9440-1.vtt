WEBVTT

00:27.413 --> 00:29.209
Beer and beef jerky.

00:30.347 --> 00:32.043
The breakfast of champions.

00:33.718 --> 00:38.483
Anyhoo, my name is Gary Houseman.

00:38.555 --> 00:40.680
I'm a guy who's done some hard living,

00:40.755 --> 00:43.657
and it all started with tennis.

00:44.826 --> 00:48.261
You know, tennis, the sport of kings.

00:48.330 --> 00:51.993
A game of beauty, power, grace,

00:52.067 --> 00:54.557
and all that other horseshit.

00:54.634 --> 00:57.535
I was born into a family of tennis freaks.

00:57.603 --> 00:59.233
I was brought up to love the game,

00:59.341 --> 01:05.936
whether it was played on grass, clay,
cement or on the table in our basement

01:06.845 --> 01:08.677
wearing only our nut-huggers.

01:08.748 --> 01:10.442
My dad loved tennis.

01:10.516 --> 01:11.813
- Regular tennis...
- Out!

01:11.883 --> 01:13.111
...table tennis, it didn't matter.

01:13.183 --> 01:14.378
Ball nicked. Point to Dwight.

01:14.453 --> 01:16.010
But my old man was a cheater.

01:16.088 --> 01:18.146
- Dwight wins.
- That's bullshit.

01:18.222 --> 01:20.553
I fucking own you, Gary.

01:20.624 --> 01:23.525
And my brother, well, he was just a dick.

01:23.594 --> 01:25.858
They shit on my game
every chance they had,

01:25.928 --> 01:29.626
and I never got a taste
of that sweet, sweet winner's jerky.

01:29.700 --> 01:33.599
I decided then and there
to go for something far sweeter.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.126
The taste of tennis glory.

01:36.204 --> 01:38.968
After years of climbing my way
up the tennis ladder,

01:39.039 --> 01:42.406
I found myself grinding it out
in the Mexican semi-pro tour,

01:42.476 --> 01:45.640
one small step away from the big leagues.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.772
But it was hot as balls,
and the prize money sucked.

01:48.849 --> 01:50.212
Eventually,

01:52.486 --> 01:53.952
the pressure kind of got to me.

01:54.020 --> 01:55.008
Sorry.

01:55.089 --> 01:58.852
Based on some on-court issues
and a minor off-court incident,

01:58.956 --> 02:01.016
I was booted off the tour.

02:01.159 --> 02:04.720
But I used my newly-found free time
to meet some new people.

02:04.795 --> 02:06.556
And also do some traveling.

02:08.365 --> 02:11.027
When I reached Nebraska, I saw a sign.

02:11.835 --> 02:14.598
And when my traveling companions
accidentally left me behind...

02:14.670 --> 02:15.830
Wait!

02:15.904 --> 02:17.930
...it was clearly another sign.

02:18.008 --> 02:20.498
I bought everyone beef jerky.

02:20.576 --> 02:22.838
As I stood there in that lonely road,

02:23.378 --> 02:27.337
I realized that this was as good a place
as any for a man to reinvent himself.

02:27.416 --> 02:30.974
As long as I kept away from tennis
and those fuzzy yellow balls,

02:31.051 --> 02:32.643
everything would be fine.

02:32.719 --> 02:36.177
Not only that, the home prices in Nebraska
are very reasonable.

02:36.255 --> 02:38.222
So I became an engineer.

02:39.692 --> 02:42.024
A custodial engineer at Lincoln West High.

02:42.093 --> 02:45.062
- Nice shorts, little guy!
- Tennis sucks, dude.

02:45.131 --> 02:46.290
And it's all good,

02:46.364 --> 02:49.764
just as long as tennis
stays the hell out of my life.

03:01.642 --> 03:03.168
What the fuck?

03:08.249 --> 03:09.807
A little help?

03:12.286 --> 03:15.119
Why won't Lady Tennis leave me alone?

03:15.189 --> 03:16.985
Little help, please.

03:32.705 --> 03:35.263
All right, backhand drill. Let's go.

03:36.140 --> 03:37.368
Randy.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.370
That was terrible.

03:41.112 --> 03:42.408
Nibbins.

03:43.046 --> 03:45.412
No. Hey, the net's this way.

03:45.481 --> 03:46.676
Mike!

03:48.452 --> 03:51.442
Nice one. That's a winner.
All right, here we go, Nibby.

03:53.788 --> 03:55.881
Nibby. Watch your head.

03:56.392 --> 03:59.053
Playing tennis? Or is that croquet?
What are you playing?

03:59.727 --> 04:02.354
Don't forget to mark it on the ball.
That's number one.

04:06.966 --> 04:09.230
- Let's bring it in, men!
- Okay.

04:11.570 --> 04:12.799
Come on, Chang.

04:15.274 --> 04:18.003
All right, 10 laps around the court
before you take off. Let's go!

04:18.076 --> 04:20.043
Nibby, let's marshal here.

05:00.179 --> 05:03.408
- Awful big forehand.
- Pardon?

05:03.513 --> 05:05.642
I saw you hitting yesterday.

05:06.685 --> 05:08.708
You don't see strokes like that very often.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.886
Yeah. Me and tennis, we go way back.

05:13.189 --> 05:16.784
- You want the long or the short version?
- I like them short.

05:23.498 --> 05:24.989
Grew up in a tennis family.

05:25.066 --> 05:27.555
My brother was headed for the pros
before he blew out his knee.

05:27.635 --> 05:30.865
According to my dad,
I never showed the same promise.

05:30.938 --> 05:34.030
But I was still good enough to win the top
spot on my hometown's college team.

05:34.108 --> 05:37.703
I only played with them briefly,
due to a lack of support from my teammates.

05:38.243 --> 05:39.905
Hey, Gary.

05:39.979 --> 05:41.776
Take that, you cheater!

05:42.147 --> 05:44.741
After leaving college,
I led a tennis journeyman's existence.

05:45.952 --> 05:49.613
But my career was rear-ended
by a total misunderstanding.

05:51.989 --> 05:53.287
What the fuck?

05:53.357 --> 05:56.153
Let the girl go! Let her go!

05:56.226 --> 05:57.853
Take me instead.

05:58.361 --> 06:00.762
Good God, Gary!
That donkey will tear you up!

06:00.897 --> 06:02.829
- I don't want to talk about tennis right now.
- Gary!

06:02.899 --> 06:06.129
After that painful experience,
I fell on some dark times.

06:06.201 --> 06:07.191
I'll save you.

06:07.270 --> 06:09.169
But eventually I got my shit together.

06:09.738 --> 06:12.297
I found this kick-ass job, and here I am.

06:12.407 --> 06:15.433
Sounds like you've walked
a rocky road, friend.

06:15.509 --> 06:18.034
But, hell, as the old man owl says,

06:18.512 --> 06:20.570
"That's what puts hair on a man's balls."

06:20.646 --> 06:22.841
That's exactly how I see it.

06:22.915 --> 06:25.544
- I'm Lew Tuttle.
- Gary Houseman.

06:25.618 --> 06:28.177
So how's your squad looking?

06:28.787 --> 06:30.755
We might win one or two matches.

06:30.823 --> 06:32.881
Team captain, he's a real scrapper.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.517
Problem is, it's a big drop
from him to our two man.

06:35.594 --> 06:36.719
Makes it hard to compete

06:36.795 --> 06:39.456
against a Southpoint High slinger
like Tommy Tremble

06:39.530 --> 06:42.727
if he doesn't have any decent competition
in practice, huh?

06:42.801 --> 06:43.891
Yeah.

06:48.439 --> 06:50.233
Say,

06:50.305 --> 06:54.401
you wouldn't happen to be free to bang
a few with him around 3:15, would you?

06:54.476 --> 06:57.103
No. I'm done with tennis.

06:57.212 --> 07:00.113
Sure, I hit a few balls yesterday,
but that was an exception.

07:00.281 --> 07:04.809
Maybe tennis has been good to you,
but she really did a fucking number on me.

07:05.486 --> 07:07.817
I will never go back to tennis.

07:12.825 --> 07:14.019
Ad-in.

07:34.977 --> 07:36.001
Get that bitch!

07:39.315 --> 07:42.339
Yeah! Fuck, yeah!

07:45.286 --> 07:47.220
He got you there, Mike!

07:54.327 --> 07:57.057
- Pretty prime strokes out there, Cappy.
- Thanks.

07:57.130 --> 08:00.064
Couple points here and there,
and I'm on the losing end of this thing.

08:01.066 --> 08:02.795
Great playing, men.

08:02.869 --> 08:04.233
Where'd you learn to hit that last one?

08:04.304 --> 08:07.703
I haven't seen a 'tweener
since Yannick Noah in the French.

08:07.771 --> 08:09.000
It's a Zen thing.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.871
You gotta be in the moment,
then lose your flow.

08:11.943 --> 08:13.240
Lose your flow, huh?

08:13.311 --> 08:15.971
Hey, if you're always free at this time,
I could sure use an assistant.

08:16.045 --> 08:20.847
I think you'd be a hell of an asset
to this team, especially to Mike over there.

08:27.522 --> 08:32.857
Well, I'm a little tight on time,
but I might be able to fit it into my schedule.

09:03.353 --> 09:04.912
All right, everybody, listen up.

09:04.989 --> 09:07.218
I'm sure most of you heard
through the grapevine

09:07.324 --> 09:11.724
Mr. Houseman here is gonna be
our new assistant coach.

09:11.792 --> 09:14.853
So let's all give him
a warm Cherokee welcome.

09:19.133 --> 09:20.829
That's pathetic.

09:22.336 --> 09:24.997
Okay, everyone, let's warm up.

09:30.776 --> 09:34.041
Coach, I've worked out some drill patterns

09:34.112 --> 09:36.809
that I think
could amplify your coaching style.

09:36.882 --> 09:38.406
Son of a bitch!

09:42.819 --> 09:44.912
Look at that little dandy.

09:44.987 --> 09:46.353
I've told him a hundred times,

09:46.423 --> 09:48.983
I don't want to see
that faggy two-handed forehand shit.

09:49.059 --> 09:51.356
Nibby, one hand, God damn it!

09:51.427 --> 09:54.658
That boy doesn't have
an ounce of self-respect.

09:55.630 --> 09:58.690
Say, can you hold down the fort?
I gotta go take a dump.

09:58.767 --> 10:00.064
You bet.

10:01.970 --> 10:04.938
Sorry about that.
You can't come in on that like that.

10:07.108 --> 10:11.475
So, are you, like, the only tennis groupie
at this school or what?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.843
I've been around the tennis scene
a long time.

10:16.915 --> 10:20.077
Believe me,
I've known plenty of chicks like you.

10:20.919 --> 10:24.149
What I don't know is which one of
these cowboys you're banging.

10:24.222 --> 10:26.815
And I need to know that
so I can coach around it.

10:26.892 --> 10:28.152
Really?

10:29.392 --> 10:30.826
Actually, I'm Jenny Tuttle.

10:30.895 --> 10:32.192
I work in the training room after school

10:32.263 --> 10:35.197
and then I come down here
to catch a ride home with my dad.

10:35.266 --> 10:38.199
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

10:38.268 --> 10:40.735
You're a Tuttle, huh?
That's fucking awesome.

10:40.804 --> 10:44.034
I didn't mean to imply that you look
like some kind of slut or something.

10:44.105 --> 10:46.370
I guess I'm the dickhead on this one.

10:46.441 --> 10:48.408
- I'm Gary, by the way.
- Yeah, I know.

10:48.476 --> 10:51.069
- School's new janitor, right?
- And the new assistant coach.

10:51.145 --> 10:53.271
I take both jobs seriously.

10:53.347 --> 10:56.406
The school has been looking
really clean lately.

10:56.483 --> 10:57.813
Thank you.

10:59.086 --> 11:01.349
Gary, you are the man.

11:01.420 --> 11:06.185
It's only taken you a few short weeks
here in Lincoln to turn your life around.

11:08.193 --> 11:10.253
Damn, beer is good.

11:11.029 --> 11:13.690
Coach Tuttle has given you a shot
at tennis redemption.

11:13.764 --> 11:14.957
Cherish it.

11:15.031 --> 11:17.399
He's Simon, you're Garfunkel

11:17.468 --> 11:20.868
and together you're about to make
sweet tennis music.

11:24.908 --> 11:27.739
We've had a lot of fun
working with rhomboids,

11:27.809 --> 11:31.369
but I can't spend the whole term
talking about rhomboids.

11:32.948 --> 11:38.078
The discussion today is triangles.

11:38.751 --> 11:39.877
So...

11:41.521 --> 11:46.151
Who can tell me the difference
between an isosceles and an equilateral?

11:47.726 --> 11:48.750
Yeah.

11:48.827 --> 11:52.125
All three sides of an equilateral triangle
have the same length

11:52.197 --> 11:54.596
and each corner has a 60-degree angle.

11:54.666 --> 11:58.465
An isosceles triangle,
only two sides are the same length and...

12:20.788 --> 12:22.447
What's going on?

12:23.557 --> 12:26.585
- Mr. Tuttle's dead!
- What?

12:27.661 --> 12:32.221
He was just explaining isosceles
and then he bent over and he just dropped.

12:33.332 --> 12:35.300
I don't understand. Triangles?

12:35.368 --> 12:36.960
He just dropped!

12:37.970 --> 12:41.769
Make a path! Get out of my fucking way!
Coach down!

12:42.007 --> 12:43.474
What the fuck!

12:45.109 --> 12:46.576
- Hey!
- He's clear.

12:46.644 --> 12:50.205
Give me the fucking things! You know,
the things! The fucking clappers!

12:50.280 --> 12:52.408
- He's been gone for 20 minutes.
- Bullshit!

12:52.482 --> 12:54.574
You medevac in a baboon's heart
right fucking now.

12:54.650 --> 12:57.848
I'm sorry, sir. You have to step back.
He's gone.

12:58.587 --> 13:00.110
Clear a path.

13:02.659 --> 13:03.647
Coming through.

13:04.893 --> 13:08.885
Come back, Coach.
Those bright lights aren't court lamps.

13:10.932 --> 13:13.298
And, obviously, we're all stunned
at what happened the other day.

13:13.367 --> 13:14.697
Lew was the real deal.

13:14.768 --> 13:17.429
They broke the mold
when they made that son of a gun.

13:17.903 --> 13:20.031
I understand Lew appointed you
to be his assistant.

13:20.106 --> 13:21.596
- Yes, sir.
- Glad to hear it.

13:21.675 --> 13:24.870
That'll make the transition a lot easier
on the boys.

13:25.276 --> 13:27.939
Gary, I've appointed Steve to be head coach.

13:28.013 --> 13:30.139
Unfortunately, Steve doesn't know
a thing about tennis,

13:30.215 --> 13:31.306
or any other sport, for that matter.

13:31.381 --> 13:34.407
Well, you know, actually,
badminton is very similar

13:34.483 --> 13:37.579
in that they both use rackets,
only instead of keeping balls aloft...

13:37.688 --> 13:40.418
But, he's the only faculty member
who volunteered,

13:40.490 --> 13:41.649
so, he's in.

13:41.724 --> 13:44.022
I'm sorry I couldn't promote you
to head coach, Gary.

13:44.092 --> 13:46.993
City rules dictate that all head coaches
have to be faculty.

13:47.062 --> 13:50.360
But you can make this a lot easier
on the boys by keeping up Lew's routines.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.557
He ran a tight ship.

13:51.632 --> 13:55.262
So, I want the two of you
to think of yourselves as co-head coaches.

13:56.603 --> 13:57.797
Amy, what are you doing here?

13:57.870 --> 14:01.236
- Sorry, Daddy, I had to leave school.
- What is it this time?

14:01.307 --> 14:03.776
I'm pregnant,
and I need money for an abortion.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.573
Amy, do you remember what Dr. Saxena said
about telling lies?

14:06.646 --> 14:08.169
But I'm not lying!

14:08.248 --> 14:09.578
And last month you had AIDS?

14:09.647 --> 14:12.775
That prostitute made me shoot up
with a dirty needle.

14:12.884 --> 14:15.409
I don't want my baby to have the AIDS!

14:15.520 --> 14:17.146
That's why I need an abortion!

14:17.221 --> 14:19.154
Honey, I'm in the middle of something here.

14:19.222 --> 14:22.589
Why don't you wait outside with Meg
and I'll walk you back to school later, okay?

14:22.660 --> 14:23.922
Okay.

14:24.294 --> 14:25.920
That's right, sweetie, stay with me.

14:27.062 --> 14:28.961
- How old is she?
- Eight.

14:29.030 --> 14:30.965
That's a fun age.

14:31.033 --> 14:32.192
Anyway, this isn't football,

14:32.268 --> 14:34.929
so no one's gonna be overly concerned
about your record.

14:35.003 --> 14:37.494
Let's just try to make tennis
something these boys can fall back on

14:37.572 --> 14:40.405
while they deal with their coach's death.

14:43.075 --> 14:47.376
- Well, yeah, certainly death is not an easy...
- I disagree.

14:47.448 --> 14:50.506
Mr. Daubert's exactly right!
We can help these boys!

14:50.584 --> 14:53.983
Tennis won't die on them.
And they need to know that!

14:56.454 --> 15:01.652
Well, I never meant to suggest
that tennis would die on them.

15:01.725 --> 15:06.025
I'm just saying that every life form expires,

15:06.096 --> 15:10.429
and it's not easy for other organisms

15:10.501 --> 15:13.593
in the vicinity of the dying party.

15:18.974 --> 15:21.567
- Jenny, can you get the door?
- Okay, Mom.

15:23.645 --> 15:26.078
Hi, Jenny. I'm so sorry.

15:26.746 --> 15:29.873
- I brought your family some chocolates.
- Thanks.

15:29.948 --> 15:32.816
- Jenny, who is it?
- The janitor.

15:33.686 --> 15:35.654
And the new head coach.

15:37.489 --> 15:38.477
Yes?

15:38.823 --> 15:39.950
I like them short.

15:42.927 --> 15:44.155
Yes?

15:45.896 --> 15:47.023
Hi.

15:51.269 --> 15:55.433
God damn it! Doesn't make any sense!
Prime of his life!

15:55.504 --> 15:57.598
I'm just worried about the boys.

15:57.674 --> 16:00.664
Coach T. Left shoes too big
for 10 men to fill,

16:00.776 --> 16:02.640
and here my assistant and I...

16:02.679 --> 16:03.873
Do you know Steve Pimble?

16:03.945 --> 16:06.675
I believe our eldest
had him for Chemistry last year.

16:06.749 --> 16:09.272
- Your eldest? Son or daughter?
- Son.

16:09.350 --> 16:12.048
- He's a freshman at the U.
- That's great.

16:12.119 --> 16:13.609
Will he coach tennis after college?

16:13.686 --> 16:18.488
I don't think so. Brad's pre-med.
He's more of an intellectual than an athlete.

16:29.367 --> 16:30.424
Yes!

16:31.701 --> 16:32.863
Yeah!

16:34.140 --> 16:36.698
Well, the world needs doctors, too.

16:37.775 --> 16:39.935
Anyway, I just thought I would ask,

16:40.009 --> 16:42.672
and please stop me
if this is inappropriate timing,

16:42.746 --> 16:45.044
I was hoping that Coach T. Had some
instructional tools,

16:45.114 --> 16:46.979
or anything that might help our transition.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.846
I remember that he had a student
videotape some of the matches.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.482
That would be great.

16:52.553 --> 16:56.318
Jenny, grab the sun tea off the porch
and pour Gary a glass.

17:03.697 --> 17:05.961
Down! Down! Get off!

17:28.685 --> 17:30.117
Here you go.

17:32.920 --> 17:33.944
Thank you.

17:34.021 --> 17:36.924
So, Jenny,
I know how much you love tennis.

17:36.993 --> 17:37.981
And I just want you to know

17:38.058 --> 17:40.651
that if you ever want to hang around
at practice like you used to,

17:40.728 --> 17:44.256
or if you need a ride home, or anything,
just let me know.

17:44.332 --> 17:46.196
I don't love tennis.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.292
You at least like it, though, right?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.731
I like watching it, I guess.
But I don't really play.

17:52.807 --> 17:54.034
Volleyball's more my sport.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.334
- Court or sand?
- Court.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.203
I'm more of a sand man, myself.

17:57.275 --> 18:01.440
In fact, I was partying with the Dominican
sand team down in Cabo a few years ago,

18:01.513 --> 18:04.208
and we were just completely
out of our minds on mescaline,

18:04.283 --> 18:05.715
and these two little nymphos walked by

18:05.783 --> 18:08.877
and they were like,
"Show us your cocks!" You know.

18:09.920 --> 18:14.016
I'm sorry, Jenny, that was probably not
the most appropriate story right now.

18:14.090 --> 18:15.990
So do you play on the volleyball team?

18:16.059 --> 18:19.891
I played in junior high,
but I'm not good enough for varsity.

18:23.266 --> 18:24.493
Thanks.

18:25.799 --> 18:27.199
Are those Coach Tuttle's dogs?

18:27.267 --> 18:29.736
Yes, they are. Were.

18:29.805 --> 18:32.600
They're quite a handful,
always knocking me down.

18:32.673 --> 18:33.901
They're just so big.

18:34.607 --> 18:36.133
May I pet them?

18:50.221 --> 18:55.750
Whether it was on the court or off the court,
Coach T. Always had time for his kids.

18:55.826 --> 18:59.158
No matter if they were in his class,
on his team,

18:59.263 --> 19:00.990
or just needed someone to talk to,

19:01.030 --> 19:03.521
Coach T. Always made them a priority.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.762
If they needed him, he was there.

19:06.835 --> 19:09.803
He was unique, and he was an original.

19:09.871 --> 19:11.931
I want to thank you all for being here today.

19:12.007 --> 19:14.133
Please sign the memorial book
on your way out.

19:14.208 --> 19:16.573
This will conclude our service.

19:34.024 --> 19:36.491
I remember the first time that I saw Coach T.

19:37.728 --> 19:41.186
He was on the court,
his beloved boys gathered around him.

19:42.465 --> 19:44.456
My God, what a presence!

19:45.601 --> 19:47.365
Next day, I met him.

19:47.870 --> 19:49.531
He told me this was his year.

19:49.605 --> 19:53.631
With this group of boys,
he would end the 20-year drought

19:53.709 --> 19:58.610
and bring home the Ark of the Covenant,
the elusive Nebraska state tennis title.

19:59.613 --> 20:04.606
Like Moses, Coach T. Will not see
the promised land with earthly eyes.

20:04.684 --> 20:08.211
But I want him to know
that we will fight the good fight.

20:08.287 --> 20:10.484
And with the help of his guiding spirit,

20:10.557 --> 20:12.853
we will bring home the state trophy
to West High

20:12.926 --> 20:15.554
where Coach always knew it belonged.

20:19.596 --> 20:21.529
God bless you, Coach T.

20:23.367 --> 20:24.995
We will always...

20:25.404 --> 20:27.029
We will always...

20:28.470 --> 20:31.337
God damn you, heaven, you son of a bitch!

20:31.408 --> 20:34.433
We're gonna miss the shit out of you,
you old man!

20:36.178 --> 20:38.236
He was a good man.

20:41.984 --> 20:43.540
Maybe the best.

21:34.828 --> 21:36.126
I love Mike.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.492
I boss tennis.

21:42.403 --> 21:43.494
What?

21:46.972 --> 21:49.565
I have...

21:51.944 --> 21:53.968
bandana.

21:57.548 --> 22:00.038
I'm sorry to interrupt.

22:00.150 --> 22:03.346
I'm Gary, the new tennis coach.

22:06.055 --> 22:10.458
May I borrow Mike for a few minutes?

22:10.792 --> 22:12.624
Yes. Mike...

22:12.960 --> 22:14.223
Yes.

22:14.996 --> 22:16.154
Yes.

22:23.302 --> 22:25.030
- She's really hot.
- Yeah.

22:25.104 --> 22:29.541
- What's her name?
- Miss Sanchez. She's from Argentina.

22:31.443 --> 22:33.775
- You banging her?
- No.

22:35.547 --> 22:38.379
So I've been watching some of your
junior year work against Southpoint.

22:38.450 --> 22:40.974
Watch this and tell me what's wrong.

22:43.622 --> 22:45.019
Get your damn head in the game!

22:45.089 --> 22:46.989
Yeah, Mike. Pull your damn head
out of your ass!

22:47.058 --> 22:50.081
- My approach shot was down the middle?
- No, that's fine.

22:50.193 --> 22:52.684
And forget that bullshit about
always approaching to the backhand.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.251
Down the middle takes away passing angles.

22:54.329 --> 22:57.228
- My approach shot was too soft?
- That's not it.

22:57.298 --> 22:59.129
I should've sliced my approach
to keep it low.

22:59.233 --> 23:02.759
Forget the fucking approach shot!
Look at your footwork.

23:03.737 --> 23:06.570
You run to the net like a maniac.
You can't cut off his angles.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.039
Do you know what a split-step is?

23:08.108 --> 23:10.166
- I'm not sure.
- I'll show you.

23:11.711 --> 23:13.542
Okay, I start off to the net,

23:13.612 --> 23:17.103
and just as my opponent hits the ball,
I stop. Just for a second.

23:17.182 --> 23:19.014
Now, I can volley in any direction.

23:19.084 --> 23:22.179
And if the cocksucker decides to get tricky
and throws up a lob,

23:22.254 --> 23:23.719
my momentum is already stopped

23:23.788 --> 23:26.755
and I can just back-pedal into
a Jimmy Connors sky-hook overhand.

23:28.258 --> 23:29.748
End of story.

23:31.328 --> 23:34.125
Okay. Yeah, I'll work on that.

23:34.197 --> 23:35.825
Good, because
if we're gonna beat Southpoint,

23:35.898 --> 23:39.061
you've got to take out
that swinging dick Tommy Tremble.

23:39.135 --> 23:41.193
By the way, was that your dad
yelling on the tape?

23:41.269 --> 23:43.202
Yeah. He's pretty competitive.

23:43.271 --> 23:46.934
- And the boy?
- That's my little brother, Ronny.

23:47.007 --> 23:48.407
I've been there, man.

23:48.477 --> 23:49.669
You were at that match?

23:49.744 --> 23:54.511
No, I mean I had a dad with a cob up his ass
and a brother with a fresh mouth.

23:55.282 --> 23:56.646
Anyways...

24:01.820 --> 24:05.277
Now, Miss Sanchez. Portuguese.

24:06.190 --> 24:09.023
Thank you for waiting.
Can I take your order, please?

24:09.093 --> 24:14.291
Yeah, give me two cheeseburgers,
two fish sandwiches,

24:14.364 --> 24:19.266
three large fries
and a large strawberry shake.

24:19.336 --> 24:22.600
- Would you like a hot apple pie with that?
- Yeah, okay.

24:23.338 --> 24:26.604
Here we go, Gary.
Your first day as head coach.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.802
I feel awesome.
Like I'm walking on sunshine.

24:29.879 --> 24:32.347
And this food is so damn tasty.

24:32.914 --> 24:35.939
And you better believe this meal's
gonna feel twice as good coming out

24:36.049 --> 24:37.846
as it did going in.

24:43.656 --> 24:46.990
Come on, guys. Bring it in, men.
Let's go, boys, bring it in.

24:50.529 --> 24:54.055
In my hand I hold every match score sheet
and tournament draw sheet

24:54.132 --> 24:56.566
this team has played in
over the past 20 years.

24:56.635 --> 25:00.831
Seven years ago, you qualified for state
and finished in 11th place.

25:01.504 --> 25:04.167
Rad. That's your one and only
highlight, gentlemen.

25:04.241 --> 25:07.403
Anyone want to go through your lowlights?
I didn't think so.

25:09.610 --> 25:11.943
Nibby! What is all this?

25:13.116 --> 25:14.583
Our records?

25:14.650 --> 25:17.812
- How about it, Chang?
- Crap.

25:17.885 --> 25:19.547
Well, I guess that's true.

25:19.655 --> 25:22.783
Cappy, what the hell is all this crap?

25:22.857 --> 25:26.313
- The past.
- That's right! It's the past.

25:26.394 --> 25:29.520
Yes, it's shit. But it's past shit.

25:29.594 --> 25:32.258
Does anyone wanna know what I think
about all these shit showings?

25:32.330 --> 25:36.630
Raise your hand if you want to know
what I think about all this shit!

26:07.529 --> 26:10.496
- What do you think about that, Cappy?
- I'm not sure.

26:10.564 --> 26:14.329
A purging! That's what we need!
A fucking purging!

26:14.400 --> 26:16.868
We've got a little Cherokee spirit
jumping out here!

26:16.936 --> 26:19.631
- Come on, you feel that, Nibby?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

26:19.705 --> 26:22.401
That's what I'm talking about!
Come on! It feels good!

26:22.506 --> 26:23.906
A fucking fresh start, Chang!

26:23.976 --> 26:26.773
- Fuck, yeah!
- Fuck, yeah! Fuck, yeah!

26:27.646 --> 26:30.135
- Coach Tuttle would have understood.
- Heck, yeah.

26:30.212 --> 26:33.340
Sometimes we need to mold beauty
out of the clay of ugliness.

26:33.416 --> 26:38.013
That said, I still should have immediately
cleaned the vomit off those courts.

26:40.189 --> 26:43.853
No problem at all. You know
I've always got time to talk football.

26:43.925 --> 26:46.256
I'm glad you've got confidence
in your offensive line, Jeffrey.

26:46.327 --> 26:47.817
That'll help me sleep at night.

26:47.896 --> 26:49.887
Hey, and tell your old man
he still owes me a sixer.

26:49.963 --> 26:51.556
It's been 20 years
and he still hasn't paid up.

26:51.633 --> 26:54.533
- All right, I'll tell him, Mr. D.
- Thanks.

26:55.501 --> 26:56.831
Is this an emergency, Steve?

26:56.903 --> 27:00.305
No, not an emergency, necessarily,
but it is about Gary.

27:00.407 --> 27:03.101
- He vomited.
- Good! Let's talk later.

27:04.343 --> 27:06.003
Mr. Daubert's office.

27:06.479 --> 27:07.878
He's a pretty busy guy.

27:08.581 --> 27:10.480
I liked your energy out there today, guys,

27:10.547 --> 27:12.640
but energy and motivation
are only half the game.

27:12.716 --> 27:15.549
A lot of you boys are weak. Physically.

27:15.619 --> 27:18.645
Especially in those little chopsticks
you like to call legs.

27:18.722 --> 27:22.555
Can't do anything in tennis
if you don't have the legs for it.

27:24.026 --> 27:26.553
Coach P. Is going to jump on my back.

27:28.530 --> 27:30.555
Come on, Coach, go ahead.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.295
Get up.

27:37.271 --> 27:38.965
Okay, guys, pair up!

27:39.040 --> 27:45.104
Fifty Popeyes each. One, two, three.

27:45.178 --> 27:47.738
- Feel that burn, Cappy?
- Yes, Coach, I do.

27:47.814 --> 27:50.975
Actually, Steve,
can you get off my back, please?

27:51.883 --> 27:54.216
Steve! Can you get off my back?

27:56.255 --> 27:57.687
What the...

27:59.322 --> 28:00.313
You guys keep going.

28:00.391 --> 28:02.359
It's gonna be a tough season, men.

28:02.427 --> 28:05.656
You're gonna have to dig deep
to make Coach T. 's dream a reality.

28:05.730 --> 28:08.026
Wipe that goddamn smile
off your face, Paul!

28:08.097 --> 28:11.999
I'm not talking about muff diving here.
I'm talking about digging for the state title!

28:18.206 --> 28:20.401
Come on, Chang!
Let's start off the season with a win!

28:28.281 --> 28:30.773
- God damn it!
- God damn it.

28:36.723 --> 28:37.711
Oh, boy.

28:38.090 --> 28:40.024
This team really sucks.

28:40.592 --> 28:43.150
Cappy, move your legs.
That's where the power comes from.

28:43.228 --> 28:45.219
Nibby, what are you doing?
What are you choking up for?

28:45.296 --> 28:47.628
Move your hand down the shaft.
You know how that feels, right?

28:47.698 --> 28:50.724
Right foot forward. All right.
Bring your arm up.

28:50.800 --> 28:54.134
Yeah. You know what?
Just go take a seat. It's okay.

28:56.741 --> 28:58.229
Jenny sure looks down.

28:58.339 --> 29:01.467
But, Gary, sometimes
you got to give people their space.

29:01.510 --> 29:04.843
And right now, you need to focus
on your second match.

29:05.247 --> 29:06.373
Yeah!

29:15.654 --> 29:19.785
Close means squat. You've got to teach
these boys to go for the damn jugular!

29:32.772 --> 29:34.863
- That's the win.
- Yeah, Paul!

29:35.039 --> 29:36.505
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

29:38.008 --> 29:40.840
It always feels good
to take one from behind.

29:40.911 --> 29:44.174
But I think we may be a player short
for making a real run at state.

29:44.247 --> 29:48.206
It might be time for Plan
Foreign Exchange Student.

29:48.284 --> 29:50.910
But you've got to admit, Gary,
the team's coming together.

29:50.985 --> 29:53.977
And it sure is nice to see
Jenny coming back around.

29:56.757 --> 29:59.487
Excuse me, Jenny. God damn this cold.

30:00.826 --> 30:03.592
You won't be late for dinner
if I run in here real quick, will you?

30:03.664 --> 30:05.096
No, I'm fine.

30:05.164 --> 30:07.394
Great. I'll just be a minute.

30:10.601 --> 30:13.230
So, Mike, how's your
lame-ass tennis team doing?

30:13.305 --> 30:15.238
We're two and three now.

30:16.641 --> 30:17.868
Right.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.709
- Hello, is Mike Jenson there?
- Mike.

30:25.849 --> 30:27.406
- Hello?
- Hey, Cappy.

30:27.651 --> 30:28.810
You're not gonna believe this.

30:28.884 --> 30:32.683
Here we got fucking Southpoint on Friday
and I got a head cold in spades,

30:32.754 --> 30:34.382
but I was calling to tell you the news.

30:34.490 --> 30:36.889
You remember that foreign exchange
student I thought I could bring in?

30:36.957 --> 30:38.323
The 20-year-old Swede?

30:38.393 --> 30:41.293
No, no, no. That fell through. The other one.
The Filipino.

30:41.361 --> 30:45.228
- I thought you said you were misled.
- More of a misunderstanding.

30:45.298 --> 30:48.290
Turns out he's the fricking junior
Ping-Pong champ of the Philippines.

30:48.367 --> 30:51.268
He never played tennis, but he must have
out-of-this-world hand-eye.

30:51.338 --> 30:54.567
He's on an overnight layover in the tropics,
but he'll be here in time for Southpoint.

30:54.639 --> 30:57.163
I just need a damn host family.
Think he can crash at your pad?

30:59.811 --> 31:01.801
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

31:02.479 --> 31:04.310
My dad doesn't like foreigners.

31:06.151 --> 31:08.243
All right. See you, Cappy.

31:09.886 --> 31:13.515
- Who the hell was that?
- Oh, it was just Coach Houseman.

31:13.590 --> 31:15.056
The janitor?

31:16.225 --> 31:17.886
Sorry about the extended pit stop.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.487
- What's in the bag?
- NyQuil and some beef jerky.

31:21.562 --> 31:24.190
Hey, hey! Let me have that!
My germs are all over it.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.627
Why did you buy condoms?

31:27.734 --> 31:31.932
Well... Jenny,
did Coach ever talk to you about...

31:32.707 --> 31:35.572
- Have you taken Health class yet?
- You don't think I know about sex?

31:35.641 --> 31:37.233
No. Yeah. It's...

31:39.044 --> 31:41.012
- Please don't open that.
- Who are you going to hump?

31:41.114 --> 31:43.981
Nobody in particular. I just realized I'm out.

31:44.649 --> 31:47.276
Gross! Why does it have ruffles?

31:47.352 --> 31:51.346
Those are called ribs, Jenny,
and they're for extra pleasure.

31:51.423 --> 31:54.913
- These are for pervs.
- No. A lot of people enjoy...

31:54.991 --> 31:57.118
You know what? This is awkward, okay?

31:57.193 --> 31:59.094
You really shouldn't be touching that
at your age.

31:59.196 --> 32:01.026
And it smells funny.

32:07.737 --> 32:10.169
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

32:12.172 --> 32:13.969
Yeah, I'll see you later!

32:16.377 --> 32:18.503
I shouldn't even be looking.

32:19.279 --> 32:21.439
Fifteen will get you 20.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.140
Know what I mean?

32:25.586 --> 32:26.779
Yeah.

32:28.386 --> 32:30.480
So when is your dad getting back?

32:30.556 --> 32:34.150
When his research is going well, sometimes
he stays on campus past midnight.

32:34.259 --> 32:37.125
- Where's your mom?
- Visiting her sister.

32:37.227 --> 32:38.592
- In China?
- Omaha.

32:49.170 --> 32:52.072
My grandpa used to play tennis in Hanoi.

32:53.708 --> 32:54.800
Okay.

32:57.743 --> 33:00.008
- What the fuck you doing?
- Your flag dropped. Good game.

33:00.080 --> 33:03.243
Jesus H., Chang! You're not gonna win
on a technicality, are you?

33:03.317 --> 33:04.443
God damn it!

33:04.519 --> 33:07.213
He looks like a goat!

33:10.157 --> 33:12.124
He really does, doesn't he?

33:16.828 --> 33:19.853
- I'll spot you five minutes.
- You're too kind.

33:23.199 --> 33:24.758
- Checkmate.
- That's a crock.

33:24.835 --> 33:27.598
You fucked me up
with all that timer horseshit!

33:29.305 --> 33:32.400
- What the fuck is he laughing at?
- He just likes to laugh.

33:32.475 --> 33:33.874
Look, Chongers.

33:33.941 --> 33:35.137
Now, I pulled some strings with Congo Air

33:35.211 --> 33:37.940
to get this Filipino kid here
in time for Friday's match.

33:38.013 --> 33:39.641
But I need a goddamn host family.

33:39.716 --> 33:43.081
- So, is your dad gonna step up or what?
- I don't know, Coach.

33:43.150 --> 33:46.880
It's kind of last minute,
and my dad's not big on surprises.

33:46.953 --> 33:49.387
Well, shit, ask your grandpa, then.

33:49.888 --> 33:50.877
Grandpa...

33:51.024 --> 33:52.753
Gary wants to know...

33:53.193 --> 33:56.424
if his friend can stay with us for a few days?

33:58.229 --> 34:01.791
Where I grew up we had eight
families living in one room...

34:02.201 --> 34:03.759
Now we have too many rooms...

34:04.236 --> 34:06.328
Gary, your friend can stay here!

34:14.044 --> 34:15.634
He says okay.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.044
Thank you.

34:34.194 --> 34:36.991
Man, I'm sick of being sick.

34:37.064 --> 34:39.725
But at least on the tennis front
things are looking up.

34:39.799 --> 34:42.666
That Filipino ringer you wrangled
is finally on his way.

34:42.733 --> 34:44.361
So just be Zen, Gary.

34:44.435 --> 34:46.461
Drink up your patented Houseman
health shake

34:46.538 --> 34:48.698
and let life's juices flow.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.628
For the love of Christ, Jones and Nibbins,

35:23.704 --> 35:26.671
don't fucking shy away
from the goddamn ball!

35:37.381 --> 35:38.814
God damn it!

35:45.356 --> 35:46.686
Jones! Nibbins!

35:46.756 --> 35:48.348
Hey, Gary! What are you doing?

35:48.423 --> 35:51.860
Why the fuck are you two
so scared of a little yellow ball?

35:51.928 --> 35:53.724
- We're not.
- I've been sitting in my house

35:53.795 --> 35:57.128
watching you two shy away from every
goddamn ball for the last 10 minutes!

35:57.199 --> 35:58.427
Tell me you haven't! Say it!

35:58.534 --> 36:00.864
- We haven't.
- Really?

36:06.206 --> 36:08.198
- Gary...
- Not now, Coach.

36:11.378 --> 36:12.742
That hurt?

36:16.815 --> 36:18.976
Hey, hey. Hey, stop crying.

36:19.984 --> 36:22.749
- Nibbins, look at me. Are you hurt?
- No.

36:22.821 --> 36:24.618
- Jonesy, you hurt?
- No.

36:24.690 --> 36:26.883
You see? There's nothing to be scared of.

36:26.958 --> 36:28.982
It's just a little yellow ball.

36:29.058 --> 36:30.923
- Stings though, don't it?
- Yeah.

36:30.994 --> 36:32.824
Listen, when you're at the net

36:32.895 --> 36:35.693
and some jokester is taking target practice
at you, guess what?

36:35.764 --> 36:37.028
He can't hurt you.

36:37.099 --> 36:41.627
And if you stay on top of the goddamn net,
you can take away all his angles!

36:41.703 --> 36:44.696
You can see that tennis
is a game of angles, can't you?

36:44.774 --> 36:46.434
- Yeah.
- Okay, then.

36:49.043 --> 36:50.441
Sorry about that, Coach.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.878
Except for Jones and Nibbins, it looks like
you got practice running pretty smoothly.

36:53.947 --> 36:55.345
Thanks.

36:55.415 --> 36:58.043
Don't look so worried. My fever broke.

37:04.821 --> 37:05.915
Attention, students.

37:05.990 --> 37:07.855
- Hey, how you doing?
- The harvest dance is this Friday night.

37:07.925 --> 37:12.987
Hey, Mr. Daubert, do you have a minute?
I need to talk to you about the tennis team.

37:13.062 --> 37:14.859
- Is there a problem?
- No.

37:15.499 --> 37:17.899
- Well, yes, sort of.
- Hey, how you doing?

37:17.968 --> 37:20.800
There just seems to be
some wrong things happening.

37:20.870 --> 37:23.565
Been some wrong things with the tennis
team for quite some time, Steve.

37:23.639 --> 37:26.130
As a matter of fact, they've pretty much
sucked for the last 20 years.

37:26.209 --> 37:28.869
- Get that History grade up, Jeffrey.
- Yes, sir, I will, Mr. D.

37:28.943 --> 37:31.674
- Well, that's not what I mean.
- What is it, Steve?

37:32.480 --> 37:35.972
Well, it's Gary. There was an incident
in front of the cross-country team.

37:36.049 --> 37:37.778
He was only wearing an athletic supporter

37:37.851 --> 37:39.910
and he was hitting the boys
with tennis balls...

37:39.986 --> 37:41.509
Not the blind boy.

37:42.088 --> 37:46.456
No, no. He was hitting our boys. You know.
And I just thought you should know.

37:46.526 --> 37:47.685
I see.

37:51.030 --> 37:53.292
Hey, listen, if you happen
to talk to Gary about this,

37:53.331 --> 37:57.893
would it possible to not discuss
where you got this information?

37:58.069 --> 37:59.057
No problem, Steve.

37:59.135 --> 38:02.502
I mean, I got budget cuts up the ass,
half the football team is failing History,

38:02.573 --> 38:05.700
and my daughter subscribes
to Leather & Bondage magazine.

38:05.775 --> 38:08.903
But don't worry, Steve,
I'll just drop everything and deal with this.

38:09.010 --> 38:11.536
Jesus, I never had you pegged
as an informer.

38:11.614 --> 38:13.307
Hey, how you doing?

38:13.949 --> 38:14.937
Okay.

38:16.683 --> 38:18.448
Look out, Johnny,
I hear this little fatherfucker

38:18.520 --> 38:20.816
can suck the skin off a potato.

38:21.754 --> 38:24.915
- I gotta go to class.
- All right, butt-monkey. Go to class.

38:24.990 --> 38:28.119
But don't let me catch you
eye-balling my Johnson again.

38:28.194 --> 38:30.491
Nibby, what the fuck?

38:30.562 --> 38:32.585
You just open wide
when they feed you shit?

38:32.664 --> 38:35.292
- Tit for fucking tat!
- He'll beat me up!

38:35.367 --> 38:37.267
Fucking A, Nibbins!
Don't shy away from this, too!

38:37.336 --> 38:39.633
- I can't.
- God damn it, Nibby!

38:39.703 --> 38:40.762
You don't do something right now,

38:40.839 --> 38:42.805
I'm gonna fucking yank you from the team,
you hear me?

38:42.873 --> 38:45.468
I got no fucking time for pansies!

38:49.412 --> 38:50.537
Dick!

38:52.314 --> 38:54.214
Hey! What the fuck is going on?

38:54.284 --> 38:56.342
That kid just knocked my shit on the floor.

38:57.352 --> 39:00.013
Why you grabbing his ass, quarterback?

39:00.121 --> 39:02.954
You like little boys' tight assholes?
Is that it?

39:02.990 --> 39:05.619
Man, I know some mean muchachos

39:05.693 --> 39:09.558
who wouldn't think twice about putting
a dent in your little boy-loving skull

39:09.628 --> 39:12.689
and shoving a fucking shiv
down your dickhole.

39:18.069 --> 39:20.538
Hey, QB, good luck
against Creighton Prep Saturday.

39:20.606 --> 39:22.869
Pitch the ball every once in a while
when you run the option.

39:22.941 --> 39:26.000
You do know you have the option
to pitch the ball on that play?

39:26.076 --> 39:28.477
That's why it's called an option.

39:41.422 --> 39:44.357
Hello, se? Or Houseman. How are you today?

39:45.660 --> 39:46.924
Hello.

39:46.995 --> 39:47.983
How are you?

39:48.130 --> 39:49.493
Very well.

39:50.231 --> 39:53.791
So, se? Or Houseman,
where did you learn to speak Spanish?

39:54.635 --> 39:57.067
Lived in México for a few years.

39:57.872 --> 40:00.203
Not only handsome, but a man of the world.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.637
A rare combination
in this part of the country.

40:03.076 --> 40:06.204
Yes. To like coffee...

40:07.245 --> 40:10.577
So, I saw that we're both signed up
to chaperone that harvest dance tonight.

40:10.681 --> 40:12.377
- Si. Si. Yes, I...
- Yeah.

40:14.352 --> 40:17.650
You know, it's like...
Maybe you and I, we could...

40:18.921 --> 40:20.412
You know what I mean?

40:20.656 --> 40:23.557
I gotta Ping-Pong airport later.

40:24.759 --> 40:26.125
You know?

40:32.801 --> 40:34.564
It's all coming together, Gary.

40:34.635 --> 40:36.865
The seeds of romance have been planted.

40:36.938 --> 40:40.600
Now we'll see if that Filipino
Ping-Pong popper pans out.

40:45.978 --> 40:50.381
At least there's something to be said
for being sick and having loose stools.

40:51.048 --> 40:54.176
That's it, Gary. Get it all out of your system.

41:03.058 --> 41:05.324
That was just a little psych-ops mission.

41:05.395 --> 41:07.921
I don't know what they told you about us
in the Philippines,

41:07.998 --> 41:11.990
but America isn't all cream cakes
and crates of Pepsi, Maricar.

41:13.937 --> 41:16.928
I'm sorry you had to watch me drop a heavy
on your first night here.

41:17.405 --> 41:21.100
Number one singles for Southpoint,
I've got Tommy Tremble.

41:22.310 --> 41:25.608
Number one singles for West,
Mr. Mike Jenson!

41:26.546 --> 41:28.843
You shouldn't have shit on our courts.

41:28.981 --> 41:30.039
- What?
- Don't listen to them.

41:30.115 --> 41:31.846
Players, the match begins now.

41:34.487 --> 41:38.582
This is not Ping-Pong, Maricar!
Hit over the net.

41:54.404 --> 41:55.598
It's over.

41:56.405 --> 42:00.671
- A lot of tennis to be played.
- Different year, same shit.

42:01.142 --> 42:02.667
Come on, Ronny.

42:05.746 --> 42:06.839
Damn it, Paul!

42:06.914 --> 42:10.849
If you're gonna be the team videographer,
I need some decent shots!

42:10.918 --> 42:13.941
Come on, man! Tennis Filming 101!
High angles!

42:15.723 --> 42:17.951
What a beautiful day.

42:18.023 --> 42:20.252
It was so kind of you to stop by
and get me out of the house.

42:20.325 --> 42:21.314
My pleasure.

42:34.371 --> 42:36.498
- What's Nibbins' score?
- He just went down a set.

42:36.572 --> 42:38.369
I've got to change the MO.

42:40.977 --> 42:42.534
The kid's foot-faulting!

42:42.611 --> 42:44.043
- Who?
- Who?

42:44.113 --> 42:47.309
Tommy Tremble, bro!
He's been doing it all goddamn day.

42:47.381 --> 42:49.576
Coach, you're out of line.

42:49.651 --> 42:53.882
If you have a complaint against Tommy,
I'll watch, and I'll see it.

42:53.955 --> 42:57.651
No wonder Southpoint never loses.
The fucking ump's on the payroll!

42:57.758 --> 43:00.522
That's enough, Coach.
You have five minutes to leave the match.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.686
Fine! I'm already gone!

43:04.230 --> 43:06.720
- What happened?
- The old-timer tossed me out.

43:06.798 --> 43:09.699
Said I have five minutes
to vacate the premises.

43:09.767 --> 43:13.066
Bring them home, Coach.
See you at the dance later.

43:13.472 --> 43:14.904
Where you going, Gary?

43:14.972 --> 43:18.100
I'm still having some issues
with the scoring system!

43:18.174 --> 43:19.404
Oh, God.

43:22.578 --> 43:23.772
Oh, no!

43:24.780 --> 43:27.376
Life's nothing
unless you take some risks, Gary.

43:27.450 --> 43:30.418
That's why tonight
you need to let it all hang out

43:30.487 --> 43:33.180
and sweep Miss Sanchez
off her little Portuguese ta-ta's.

43:44.731 --> 43:46.358
Punch.

43:47.199 --> 43:49.394
So, you win big matches?

43:49.469 --> 43:53.098
From what I saw
it wasn't looking too good, Miss Sanchez.

43:53.172 --> 43:55.072
I'm sorry to hear that.

43:56.207 --> 43:58.903
You can call me Norma, se? Or Houseman.

44:00.010 --> 44:03.969
So... Hey, you want to go out there and...

44:04.047 --> 44:05.275
Yes?

44:09.586 --> 44:11.450
Thanks for the punch.

44:13.556 --> 44:16.785
Hello, Miss Sanchez.
You look muy bonita this evening.

44:16.858 --> 44:21.523
So, maybe I could start stopping by
after school for some one-on-one tutoring.

44:22.497 --> 44:24.623
No. I don't like waste time.

44:26.132 --> 44:30.194
So, what was the final damage with
that little dingleberry Tommy Tremble?

44:31.337 --> 44:32.701
4-6, 5-7.

44:32.772 --> 44:36.174
Hey, not bad. It's not a win, but not bad.

44:37.177 --> 44:39.508
Jesus, Cappy, why aren't you out in your car

44:39.578 --> 44:43.137
getting your dinky stinky
in some tight little cheerleader?

44:43.213 --> 44:44.773
What is that? Punch?

44:44.850 --> 44:47.011
I'm a little thirsty.
I'm gonna get myself a coffee.

44:49.020 --> 44:54.047
Ask someone to dance! Jesus!
It's not that hard to say, "Hey, Norma,

44:54.125 --> 44:56.490
"would you like to dance with me?"

44:56.559 --> 44:59.084
Or, you know, Sally, or Betsy.
It don't matter.

45:05.167 --> 45:06.930
Hey, what about her?

45:08.871 --> 45:12.397
- Yeah, right.
- Come on! Give it a shot. You never know.

45:12.472 --> 45:15.271
- But I don't know any moves.
- Moves?

45:15.343 --> 45:20.972
This isn't Soul Train, man.
Just get out there and explore your vibe.

45:21.546 --> 45:23.412
Watch. I'll show you.

46:27.069 --> 46:29.229
So, Jenny, I thought you were having
a great time dancing,

46:29.304 --> 46:32.741
but then I look over, and poof,
you're off by yourself, all sad.

46:32.808 --> 46:35.868
Things have just gotten really heavy,
ever since my dad died.

46:35.944 --> 46:38.275
- It's hard to explain.
- I get it.

46:39.314 --> 46:43.909
I mean, I've never lost a parent,
but I feel like I never really had a dad.

46:43.984 --> 46:46.975
But that's a whole other kettle of fish.

46:57.497 --> 46:58.758
Jenny.

47:00.965 --> 47:02.023
Hey.

47:06.203 --> 47:10.105
It's natural to want... You know?

47:10.174 --> 47:13.301
I mean, losing your dad, and I'm older...

47:14.376 --> 47:15.970
I know I'm sexy.

47:17.881 --> 47:21.042
It's just been really hard without him,
you know?

47:23.885 --> 47:25.147
Oh, hell.

47:29.656 --> 47:31.123
There you go.

47:34.660 --> 47:37.595
Jenny, I don't think
we should be doing this.

47:40.197 --> 47:42.463
It's really not a good idea.

47:44.536 --> 47:45.867
I'm sorry.

47:48.739 --> 47:50.970
Breathe into the pain, Jenny.

47:52.277 --> 47:54.301
Breathe into the pain.

47:54.378 --> 47:55.900
Jesus!

47:59.882 --> 48:01.280
Fucking guy.

48:04.119 --> 48:10.182
Coach Tuttle's Rottweilers! Knock it off!
Hey, Amy. Mr. D! How you doing?

48:12.160 --> 48:14.628
- May I have a word, Gary?
- Sure.

48:14.694 --> 48:15.854
I was just informed you were caught

48:15.928 --> 48:17.829
dry-humping Jenny Tuttle
at the school dance.

48:17.897 --> 48:19.363
Who told you that damn lie?

48:19.431 --> 48:21.662
It was an anonymous phone call, Gary.
Do you deny it?

48:21.735 --> 48:23.565
Of course not!

48:23.635 --> 48:26.263
If you say you got an anonymous
phone call, then I believe you.

48:26.338 --> 48:29.796
No, I mean do you deny
dry-humping Jenny Tuttle at the dance?

48:29.875 --> 48:31.637
God, yes!

48:31.709 --> 48:34.678
- I'm suspending you from the team.
- Because of an anonymous phone call?

48:34.746 --> 48:37.545
Look, Gary, I like you. You've got cojones.

48:37.614 --> 48:41.344
- Fish?
- No. Balls. Big ones.

48:41.417 --> 48:43.079
But the shit keeps rolling downhill.

48:43.153 --> 48:46.020
My ex-wife, these budget cuts,
and this damn fall Sports meeting...

48:46.090 --> 48:49.420
But, we just got to win one out of the next
three matches and we qualify for state.

48:49.491 --> 48:51.983
Then we make Coach Tuttle's dream
a reality.

48:52.061 --> 48:54.187
I just can't be dealing
with a loose cannon now, Gary.

48:54.263 --> 48:55.627
I'm sorry.

48:58.166 --> 49:02.101
Maricar! Inside! Inside!

49:03.171 --> 49:05.660
Damn it, Gary, this is exactly
what I'm talking about!

49:05.737 --> 49:07.365
I thought he was staying with the Changs.

49:07.440 --> 49:12.172
So did I! His grandpa was on board.
But his dad is not a team player.

49:13.278 --> 49:15.609
Let's go, Amy! Stop playing with the dogs!

49:20.051 --> 49:22.145
Who got dry-humped, Daddy?

49:25.222 --> 49:26.916
So it's really not a big deal.

49:26.991 --> 49:29.516
Actually, I wanted to focus more
on my custodial duties,

49:29.593 --> 49:32.584
so the timing of this thing is pretty good.

49:33.696 --> 49:37.154
- Pretty good.
- But why were you suspended, Coach?

49:37.233 --> 49:40.359
Hey, I've got some weekend
hallway buffing to do.

49:49.376 --> 49:51.570
Let's go. Come on.

49:53.045 --> 49:54.479
Come on, let's go.

49:55.681 --> 50:01.676
Well, you guys should probably pair up
and do some volleys or something.

50:02.322 --> 50:05.345
If you have to know, Nibbins,
I got caught in the girls' bathroom

50:05.423 --> 50:09.483
finger-blasting Mike's Spanish teacher
at your oh-so-precious harvest dance!

50:09.560 --> 50:12.358
Is that what you wanted to hear, Nibbins?

50:14.397 --> 50:15.592
Sorry.

50:17.400 --> 50:19.765
You guys will be fine without me.

50:20.369 --> 50:21.358
Cappy?

50:23.507 --> 50:25.632
You could've been a champion.

50:41.721 --> 50:45.781
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

50:51.229 --> 50:52.422
Fore!

51:07.009 --> 51:08.270
Move it!

51:08.343 --> 51:10.642
- Sit the fuck down!
- Out of the way, jerk!

51:10.712 --> 51:15.411
Fuck the Huskers! Fuck football!
Fuck all you fuckers!

51:15.483 --> 51:18.543
- You big fucker!
- Not the face! Ear!

51:41.505 --> 51:45.668
Maricar? What are you doing here?
Is Gary here?

51:46.808 --> 51:48.743
Gary? Are you in there?

51:50.913 --> 51:52.005
Gary?

51:52.514 --> 51:54.743
So you're just gonna run away?

51:55.483 --> 51:59.113
I told your dad
that I'd bring home his state title.

51:59.221 --> 52:01.052
Now I've lost my team,

52:01.821 --> 52:05.622
and broken my promise to the only man
who ever gave me a helping hand.

52:05.693 --> 52:08.388
My dad's gone
and now you're leaving me, too.

52:09.497 --> 52:12.464
You're a damn quitter, Gary, and I hate you.

52:27.278 --> 52:28.677
Awful big forehand.

52:28.745 --> 52:31.713
Hey, if you're always free at this time,
I could sure use an assistant.

52:32.749 --> 52:35.149
I think you'd be a hell of an asset
to this team.

52:35.219 --> 52:36.685
I like them short.

52:41.190 --> 52:42.385
I just wanted one!

52:45.293 --> 52:47.487
One goddamn stick of winner's jerky.

52:47.561 --> 52:49.221
I'm so sleepy.

53:05.042 --> 53:06.372
Dig deep, Gary.

53:06.444 --> 53:08.071
Come on, Coach.

53:12.482 --> 53:15.508
- It's time to change the mold.
- Fuck me.

53:21.056 --> 53:23.422
It's beautiful, isn't it?

53:26.161 --> 53:27.524
I love you.

53:35.402 --> 53:36.563
Daddy?

53:39.440 --> 53:43.341
It doesn't take a Ph.D. In dreamology
to know what that was all about, Gary.

53:43.409 --> 53:44.638
You got to get back on the team

53:44.711 --> 53:46.905
if they're going to have a chance
at tennis glory.

53:46.979 --> 53:50.675
It's also clear you need Jenny and Maricar
to help make it happen.

53:51.049 --> 53:53.016
I just don't see where...

53:53.084 --> 53:54.846
Wait. Found it!

53:56.220 --> 53:58.278
It feels a lot worse than it looks.

53:58.388 --> 54:01.257
- So have you talked to Gary lately?
- No. Have you?

54:01.292 --> 54:04.748
I kind of got mad at him yesterday.
I feel bad. He was really down, but...

54:04.828 --> 54:07.728
Well, he hasn't said a word to me
since Coach Pimble took over.

54:07.797 --> 54:10.060
- How's it going with Pimble?
- Sucks.

54:10.134 --> 54:13.862
I mean, we were all pumped
about being one win from making state,

54:13.933 --> 54:17.460
and now we're all bummed out
about being one win from making state.

54:17.539 --> 54:20.507
So I saw you dance with Molly Sharpe
the other night.

54:20.573 --> 54:23.007
Is it nice and tight, or all loose and floppy?

54:23.910 --> 54:25.104
I don't...

54:25.378 --> 54:26.367
Floppy?

54:27.648 --> 54:29.705
You know, I didn't...

54:29.782 --> 54:31.977
Molly and I are just friends, and...

54:32.051 --> 54:36.043
Your shoe. You should keep it
nice and tight to avoid blisters.

54:38.122 --> 54:39.488
Right.

54:40.358 --> 54:42.019
Nice. Nice call.

54:43.459 --> 54:45.986
Well, I should get back to practice.

54:46.797 --> 54:50.596
Hey, by the way,
you were looking pretty prime at the dance.

54:50.666 --> 54:51.997
Prime, huh?

54:57.007 --> 54:59.802
So, boys, I know we've had
a couple of really tough losses,

54:59.908 --> 55:02.071
but I don't think
you're hitting the balls hard enough.

55:02.111 --> 55:06.205
So I think we should do some push-ups,
you know? Get stronger.

55:06.281 --> 55:08.907
Coach Houseman said
tennis players should never do push-ups.

55:08.981 --> 55:10.006
Why not?

55:10.083 --> 55:12.746
Is there any chance Coach Houseman
will come back?

55:12.820 --> 55:15.755
I think we should just focus
on the push-ups.

55:20.159 --> 55:21.785
Everybody down.

55:22.793 --> 55:24.625
Maricar, everybody.

55:26.097 --> 55:30.556
Hey. Hey, buddy? Lower to the ground,
there, and you're gonna push up...

55:30.634 --> 55:31.863
God damn it.

55:33.270 --> 55:36.397
Coach P. Should know better
than to make them do push-ups.

55:36.472 --> 55:40.501
The last thing a tennis player needs
are man-tits obstructing his strokes.

55:40.577 --> 55:42.669
I feel better than I can ever remember.

55:42.745 --> 55:45.839
Coach Tuttle may well be
skin-walking in my body.

55:45.914 --> 55:49.508
Miss Sanchez! I'm really glad to see you.

55:49.583 --> 55:52.883
- I wanted to ask you for a favor.
- I hear rumor, se? Or Houseman.

55:52.952 --> 55:56.821
I hear the kids whisper
that you lose your whistle because of me.

55:56.891 --> 55:59.858
They say we play the sexy fingers at dance.

56:01.192 --> 56:02.785
- Kids!
- Did you say this?

56:02.863 --> 56:03.954
No!

56:05.430 --> 56:07.762
Yes. I'm sorry.

56:07.832 --> 56:11.393
I made up that stupid story as an excuse
for getting suspended from the team.

56:11.468 --> 56:13.868
Well, this very stupid. It's no nice for me

56:13.938 --> 56:17.100
and my reputation
as good teacher and good coach.

56:17.173 --> 56:19.699
You're definitely right. I'm really sorry.

56:19.776 --> 56:21.574
And it's interesting
that you're bringing up coaching,

56:21.645 --> 56:24.169
because I wanted to ask you a favor
regarding your volleyball team.

56:24.247 --> 56:25.680
You know Jenny Tuttle, right?

56:25.748 --> 56:29.046
Yes, I know Jenny Tootle.
She quit my volleyball tryout last year.

56:29.117 --> 56:31.086
Would you ask her to try out
for this year's team?

56:31.153 --> 56:34.986
She's had a rough year, and it would mean
a lot to her, and her father.

56:35.056 --> 56:38.387
Okay, se? Or Houseman. Maybe I do this.

56:39.225 --> 56:42.525
- But no more stories, okay?
- Done. Thank you.

56:47.533 --> 56:49.593
I like the sexy fingers.

57:02.345 --> 57:04.210
What's happening here?

57:16.392 --> 57:17.620
Jenny.

57:18.492 --> 57:20.552
- Gary?
- Yeah.

57:22.329 --> 57:25.196
- What are you doing in here?
- Replenishing the tampon dispenser.

57:25.265 --> 57:27.700
- Would you like one?
- No, thanks.

57:27.768 --> 57:29.258
On the house.

57:31.438 --> 57:34.964
I'm sorry about last night.
I understand if you hate me.

57:35.808 --> 57:39.072
I don't hate you, Gary.
I like you, that's why I was upset.

57:39.143 --> 57:41.475
That's good to hear,
because I need to ask for a favor.

57:41.545 --> 57:43.673
You said that Mr. Daubert
and your mom are friendly, right?

57:43.747 --> 57:44.736
Yeah.

57:44.816 --> 57:47.306
Do you think you could get your mom
to talk to him about reinstating me?

57:47.383 --> 57:49.818
Yeah, I'll ask her to.

57:51.622 --> 57:54.716
- I'm glad you're no quitter, Gary.
- Me, too.

58:06.467 --> 58:10.335
Yes, I believe her when she says
Gary didn't make a move on her.

58:10.403 --> 58:13.167
But that's not the point, Phyllis.
Gary's a loose cannon.

58:13.240 --> 58:16.437
If he screws up,
it's my cojones on the chopping block.

58:17.410 --> 58:20.775
I know in my heart
it's what Lew would have wanted.

58:23.549 --> 58:25.210
Can you feel it?

58:26.485 --> 58:28.179
Yes, I think I can.

58:29.287 --> 58:29.352
Look, the point is, the tennis team
is obviously causing problems.

58:29.353 --> 58:33.015
Look, the point is, the tennis team
is obviously causing problems.

58:33.091 --> 58:35.650
So, why don't we just cancel
the rest of their season

58:35.726 --> 58:38.889
and funnel their budget
into the football team's sideline mist system

58:38.962 --> 58:40.951
that we supposedly can't afford?

58:41.330 --> 58:43.890
- Yeah!
- Yeah! I don't like tennis! Or golf.

58:43.965 --> 58:47.628
All right, people, settle down.
Settle down. Look...

58:47.702 --> 58:49.966
Okay, Maricar. Again.

58:53.942 --> 58:58.308
I rob Couch Hoseman.

58:59.379 --> 59:01.904
"I love Coach Houseman"!

59:01.982 --> 59:04.848
I lub Hooch Cooseman.

59:04.918 --> 59:08.114
Do we have any tennis boosters here
who care to make a comment?

59:20.231 --> 59:24.098
Okay. Steve, want to add something here?

59:30.772 --> 59:34.230
Well, you know, I don't think
we've been doing that badly.

59:34.310 --> 59:36.276
We've actually won quite a few matches,

59:36.345 --> 59:39.712
and the boys seem to be learning
a lot about sportsmanship.

59:40.347 --> 59:42.941
And as far as Gary's suspension goes,

59:44.151 --> 59:49.452
well, the boys actually seem to miss him.
I think they looked up to him quite a bit.

59:51.557 --> 59:54.823
He's prone to outbursts,
but his heart is in the right place.

59:54.895 --> 59:55.952
Come to think of it,

59:56.028 --> 59:58.620
I think we made a pretty damn good
coaching duo.

59:58.697 --> 1:00:00.688
Let's watch the language, Steve.

1:00:01.432 --> 1:00:07.064
"I love Coach Houseman."

1:00:07.670 --> 1:00:12.130
I rob House Couchman.

1:00:16.211 --> 1:00:17.838
- "I...
- I...

1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:20.449
- "...Iove...
...Iove...

1:00:21.182 --> 1:00:23.150
- "...Coach...
...Coach...

1:00:23.551 --> 1:00:26.213
- "...Houseman."
...House-cinnamon.

1:00:27.255 --> 1:00:29.983
So I suggest we give them
one final chance to perform

1:00:30.056 --> 1:00:32.387
by reinstating Gary as assistant.

1:00:32.459 --> 1:00:34.051
If they fail to qualify for state,

1:00:34.127 --> 1:00:36.287
we'll cut the team
and give the money to football.

1:00:36.362 --> 1:00:38.956
- Any objections?
- Why are we still talking about tennis?

1:00:39.031 --> 1:00:41.261
Good Lord! Can we move on to football?

1:00:41.333 --> 1:00:44.165
Now, you've scheduled
an away game at Scottsbluff.

1:00:44.235 --> 1:00:46.534
Now, that's seven hours away...

1:00:47.404 --> 1:00:52.966
I rub Crotch Horseman!

1:01:01.549 --> 1:01:04.678
I think we're actually gonna do it!
I think we're gonna make state!

1:01:04.754 --> 1:01:08.210
Play it cool, Steve.
Making state's not that big of a deal.

1:01:08.288 --> 1:01:10.950
You got to learn to start
setting higher goals.

1:01:14.428 --> 1:01:17.453
Yeah! We're going to state, baby!

1:01:18.930 --> 1:01:20.592
Oh, my hammy.

1:02:05.806 --> 1:02:08.934
Jesus, Nibby! I set you up perfectly!

1:02:09.009 --> 1:02:10.669
Why the hell didn't you accept
a groin-muscle rub

1:02:10.742 --> 1:02:12.334
from a sexy girl like Jenny Tuttle?

1:02:12.410 --> 1:02:14.311
I don't know. I just didn't.

1:02:14.380 --> 1:02:15.677
Were those jocks right?

1:02:15.747 --> 1:02:17.806
- Are you some kind of fag?
- No.

1:02:17.882 --> 1:02:20.816
Hey, if you are, you are.
It's not the end of the world.

1:02:21.553 --> 1:02:23.077
But you're in the ninth grade.

1:02:23.154 --> 1:02:25.519
You've got plenty of time
in the future for gay sex.

1:02:25.589 --> 1:02:28.489
If you want to come out of the closet, great.
If not, that's fine, too.

1:02:28.557 --> 1:02:31.619
Play it cool, man. Just do your own thing.

1:02:31.694 --> 1:02:33.922
When you get to college,
then have your cock-fest.

1:02:33.995 --> 1:02:36.987
But I don't think that I'm gay.

1:02:37.799 --> 1:02:40.769
Hell, you can still have sex
while you're in high school.

1:02:40.836 --> 1:02:43.633
Just spin her over and pretend
you're pumping some dude.

1:02:43.703 --> 1:02:45.830
- But I...
- Come on. We're on.

1:02:46.474 --> 1:02:51.240
- Go, Cherokees, go! Go, Cherokees, go!
- Go, Cherokees, go! Go, Cherokees, go!

1:02:51.311 --> 1:02:52.869
And this makes five years in a row

1:02:52.946 --> 1:02:55.379
that our football warriors
have qualified for state.

1:02:55.447 --> 1:02:56.470
What's up?

1:02:56.549 --> 1:02:59.780
Let's give them one more Cherokee cheer!

1:03:12.294 --> 1:03:15.595
I almost forgot.
Our tennis team qualified for state as well,

1:03:15.666 --> 1:03:18.895
so let's give them a round of applause,
shall we?

1:03:23.438 --> 1:03:25.373
I'll take it from here.

1:03:34.248 --> 1:03:36.238
Allow me to introduce to you

1:03:36.315 --> 1:03:38.112
public enemy number one,

1:03:38.185 --> 1:03:40.674
Southpoint High's Tommy Tremble.

1:03:40.751 --> 1:03:42.948
And now meet the team
who's gonna take him down.

1:03:43.021 --> 1:03:46.252
Your Cherokee Tennis starting lineup!

1:03:46.326 --> 1:03:48.724
And let's not forget
the man behind the scenes,

1:03:48.793 --> 1:03:52.559
Coach Steve "The Bunsen Burner" Pimble.

1:03:54.499 --> 1:03:59.196
And I'm Coach Gary Houseman,
the guy who's guaranteeing everyone here

1:03:59.303 --> 1:04:04.466
that you've just been introduced to the next
Nebraska state tennis champions!

1:04:04.506 --> 1:04:06.633
And tomorrow I expect
each and every one of you

1:04:06.707 --> 1:04:09.143
to call in sick and come support our squad!

1:04:32.162 --> 1:04:33.323
Bitch!

1:04:44.674 --> 1:04:48.269
The pep rally was a total success.
Total success.

1:04:48.345 --> 1:04:51.335
My only concern is where Mike's head is at.
Is he ready to win?

1:04:51.413 --> 1:04:54.144
Ready to be a champion? Be a man?

1:04:54.216 --> 1:04:57.277
Maybe Coach P. And I
should have a word with him.

1:05:00.053 --> 1:05:03.786
Coach, I don't think
we should be giving alcohol to a minor.

1:05:03.858 --> 1:05:06.793
- Why not? You an informer?
- No! No way!

1:05:06.861 --> 1:05:10.522
Actually, I probably shouldn't be drinking
a beer the night before state.

1:05:10.596 --> 1:05:13.531
You two need to fucking relax.
It's just a beer.

1:05:13.966 --> 1:05:16.799
This is exactly why I called you here, Cappy.

1:05:16.867 --> 1:05:19.497
- To drink a beer?
- To be a man.

1:05:20.238 --> 1:05:24.174
- By drinking a beer?
- Yes, by drinking a fucking beer!

1:05:24.242 --> 1:05:26.004
By understanding
that you're not going to be intimidated

1:05:26.077 --> 1:05:28.204
by that little piece of shit Tommy Tremble.

1:05:28.280 --> 1:05:30.246
Well, I don't think I've been intimidated.

1:05:30.313 --> 1:05:34.408
Well, you haven't beaten him yet, have you?
He's just a kid. And you're a man.

1:05:34.484 --> 1:05:39.442
And that's why you gotta drink a fucking
beer. Because you are a fucking man.

1:05:56.168 --> 1:05:59.296
Hey, Gary, I thought you said it was
going to be just us three here tonight.

1:05:59.404 --> 1:06:02.373
- We got to hide this stuff.
- It's all good, Coach.

1:06:05.610 --> 1:06:06.599
Hi.

1:06:07.345 --> 1:06:10.210
- Hello, boys. I'm Steffi Nash.
- No, it's "Graf"!

1:06:10.280 --> 1:06:11.612
Whatever.

1:06:13.417 --> 1:06:16.078
You gotta take that thing off.
We got ourselves a first-timer here.

1:06:16.152 --> 1:06:17.244
Okay.

1:06:20.789 --> 1:06:21.951
Tunes.

1:06:22.659 --> 1:06:25.559
No, this is who you need to focus on.

1:06:32.967 --> 1:06:36.129
Okay. Gary, I think I'm just gonna head out.

1:06:36.202 --> 1:06:39.070
No way. Just stay for one song and a beer.

1:06:39.407 --> 1:06:40.929
Don't set a puss example for Cappy.

1:06:41.006 --> 1:06:44.272
We're trying to make a man of him,
for Christ's sake.

1:07:04.794 --> 1:07:06.786
Feels awesome, doesn't it?

1:07:23.309 --> 1:07:24.367
Yeah.

1:07:24.911 --> 1:07:26.503
I'll change the tape.

1:07:26.580 --> 1:07:29.913
Hey, Coach? I think I got to get going.

1:07:29.982 --> 1:07:33.179
- We have her for another 20 minutes.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1:07:33.252 --> 1:07:34.548
Proud of you, Cappy!

1:07:37.288 --> 1:07:39.723
Why don't you take those pants off?

1:07:40.525 --> 1:07:42.320
I left my comb in my car.

1:07:43.594 --> 1:07:45.390
Sweet dreams, Coach.

1:07:48.198 --> 1:07:52.691
All right, Steffi Nash. Buckle up
that strap-on and let's get weird.

1:07:52.767 --> 1:07:54.497
Okay, sweetie.

1:08:03.610 --> 1:08:09.139
Okay! I'm definitely bleeding!
Oh, God, I've got puncture wounds! Gary!

1:08:09.850 --> 1:08:12.579
State. It's a two-day tournament, gentlemen.

1:08:12.652 --> 1:08:15.745
You can't win it on the first day,
but you can sure as hell lose it.

1:08:15.821 --> 1:08:18.524
We've got to start strong
and finish even stronger.

1:08:19.290 --> 1:08:22.689
Okay, when we get out of the van,
nobody goes to the bathroom, nobody talks.

1:08:22.761 --> 1:08:25.423
We go straight into our pattern. Got it?

1:08:25.497 --> 1:08:28.158
Let these babies fly during our pattern.

1:08:28.232 --> 1:08:32.726
When you all get out, leave the doors open.
Let's see if this baby rocks.

1:09:03.462 --> 1:09:05.828
Damn it, Coach P! Get them up! Up!

1:09:10.201 --> 1:09:11.258
Attaboy, Coach.

1:09:11.336 --> 1:09:13.030
That's what I'm talking about.

1:09:16.038 --> 1:09:17.471
Up top, Cappy!

1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:26.078
How long before you do
one of my boys' rackets?

1:09:26.147 --> 1:09:28.844
Got this one, plus two more I'm doing
for Tommy Tremble,

1:09:28.918 --> 1:09:31.680
so I'd say about an hour.

1:09:31.753 --> 1:09:33.116
These don't have any broken strings.

1:09:33.187 --> 1:09:37.146
For big tournaments,
Tommy likes fresh strings each morning.

1:09:37.224 --> 1:09:39.487
- Fucking prima donna.
- Mom's kind of hot.

1:09:43.531 --> 1:09:44.588
Yes!

1:10:12.688 --> 1:10:13.950
Great day today, guys.

1:10:14.023 --> 1:10:16.319
Good match, Chongers.
I'll see you at home, Maricar.

1:10:16.390 --> 1:10:17.981
Nice job, Paul.

1:10:18.058 --> 1:10:21.290
Hey, Cappy, hold up a minute.
We surprised a lot of people today.

1:10:21.363 --> 1:10:22.989
But it's day two that counts.

1:10:23.063 --> 1:10:26.429
You beat Tommy, and tomorrow
we make Coach T.'s dream a reality.

1:10:26.498 --> 1:10:30.798
Hey, Coach? Why do you respect
Coach Tuttle so much?

1:10:31.138 --> 1:10:34.594
I mean, I think he was a nice guy
and everything,

1:10:34.672 --> 1:10:37.472
but you seem to really look up to him.

1:10:38.077 --> 1:10:41.602
Cappy, if God didn't exist,

1:10:42.514 --> 1:10:44.480
would you invent him?

1:10:45.884 --> 1:10:47.543
I'm not sure. Why?

1:10:48.953 --> 1:10:52.409
Never mind. Doesn't matter. God does exist.

1:10:52.489 --> 1:10:56.048
And Coach Tuttle really was a good man.
Maybe the best.

1:10:58.427 --> 1:11:00.656
You're gonna do great tomorrow.

1:11:29.821 --> 1:11:33.619
Coach, will you run them through
warm-ups? I gotta use the head.

1:11:35.458 --> 1:11:37.085
Yeah, okay.

1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:39.355
Okay, boys. Don't forget your tennis rackets.

1:11:40.062 --> 1:11:41.927
Or your balls. Tennis balls.

1:11:42.564 --> 1:11:45.090
- Hey, old timer, how you doing?
- Pretty good.

1:11:45.167 --> 1:11:46.191
Good.

1:11:46.268 --> 1:11:49.100
Well, looks like you got your hands full
with Tommy's rackets already.

1:11:49.170 --> 1:11:50.193
Yeah.

1:11:50.271 --> 1:11:53.537
We're warming up next to Southpoint.
If you want, I can drop it off for you.

1:11:53.608 --> 1:11:56.474
- Sure. Saves me a trip.
- Good.

1:12:01.681 --> 1:12:05.378
Hey, so the guys are outside warming up.
They seem pretty confident.

1:12:05.451 --> 1:12:07.509
I got to tell you, Mike is really...

1:12:07.586 --> 1:12:09.281
Hey, are those Tommy's rackets?

1:12:09.355 --> 1:12:11.083
I need you to guard the door
for two minutes,

1:12:11.156 --> 1:12:12.486
don't let anybody in.

1:12:12.557 --> 1:12:14.718
- What's going on?
- Jesus, Steve! Listen!

1:12:14.793 --> 1:12:17.226
- Watch the fucking door!
- What are you doing with those rackets?

1:12:17.294 --> 1:12:18.658
Forget about the fucking rackets,

1:12:18.728 --> 1:12:21.720
and for once this season, step up
and make a tangible fucking contribution!

1:12:21.798 --> 1:12:23.494
Can you do that?

1:12:30.071 --> 1:12:31.700
Tangible contribution?

1:12:46.420 --> 1:12:48.546
Gary, what's happening here?

1:12:53.124 --> 1:12:56.560
Brian saw you in the locker room
shaving my strings, Gary!

1:12:56.628 --> 1:12:57.960
You're a fucking cheater, man!

1:12:58.196 --> 1:12:59.527
I didn't shave your strings!

1:13:03.967 --> 1:13:05.833
Okay, so I shaved a few strings.

1:13:09.573 --> 1:13:11.699
- Fucking cheater, man!
- Fucking cheater, man!

1:13:22.550 --> 1:13:25.611
- The hell were you doing in there, man?
- Nothing.

1:13:25.688 --> 1:13:27.086
- But Tommy's rackets...
- Hey.

1:13:27.154 --> 1:13:30.520
Relax. I didn't do anything to the rackets.

1:13:31.089 --> 1:13:33.356
I just needed to clear my head.

1:13:50.341 --> 1:13:52.069
I couldn't find Tommy anywhere.

1:13:52.143 --> 1:13:54.871
Yeah, I figured.
He was in here looking for his rackets.

1:13:54.944 --> 1:13:56.808
You must have just missed him.

1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:00.542
Well, I'll just leave his sticks here, then.
Sorry about that.

1:14:02.616 --> 1:14:03.847
Nice young man.

1:14:03.919 --> 1:14:07.513
I can't believe Nibby and Jones.
They didn't shy away once!

1:14:09.290 --> 1:14:10.620
Good luck today, Mike!

1:14:10.957 --> 1:14:12.391
Gracias.

1:14:12.693 --> 1:14:17.153
Okay. Get your mind off of
se? Orita Tight-ass and stay focused.

1:14:17.864 --> 1:14:19.730
- I am focused.
- Good.

1:14:22.733 --> 1:14:25.567
- I bet she's got puffy nipples.
- What's that?

1:14:26.272 --> 1:14:28.172
- Nothing.
- Coach?

1:14:30.408 --> 1:14:33.843
- Do you think I can win?
- Of course I do.

1:14:33.911 --> 1:14:39.348
No, I mean do you really think it?
It's just... I don't know.

1:14:41.850 --> 1:14:43.580
Look at me, Cappy.

1:14:43.653 --> 1:14:46.052
Don't you fucking worry about what I think,

1:14:46.121 --> 1:14:49.453
or your dad thinks,
or Tommy little-peckerwood Tremble thinks.

1:14:49.524 --> 1:14:51.459
Worry about how deep you're gonna dig.

1:14:51.527 --> 1:14:53.551
Worry about not leaving that goddamn court

1:14:53.629 --> 1:14:55.653
until you've donated a pint
of AB fucking Negative

1:14:55.730 --> 1:14:57.663
to the green fucking pavement out there!

1:14:57.766 --> 1:14:59.356
Whether you can win or not.

1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:01.493
Worry about that when it's over.

1:15:01.569 --> 1:15:05.231
- Got it?
- Yeah. Thanks, Coach.

1:15:11.677 --> 1:15:13.201
He's never gonna win.

1:15:26.254 --> 1:15:29.225
Gentlemen. Two out of three sets.

1:15:29.291 --> 1:15:33.785
If you split the first two, you'll receive
a 15-minute break before the final set.

1:15:33.863 --> 1:15:38.095
This match will determine
which team takes home the state title.

1:15:39.134 --> 1:15:40.794
- Any questions?
- No.

1:15:40.868 --> 1:15:42.267
Okay. Begin!

1:15:50.642 --> 1:15:51.940
Let's go, Tommy!

1:15:52.012 --> 1:15:53.410
Settle down.

1:15:58.583 --> 1:15:59.948
Take it to him, Mike!

1:16:08.726 --> 1:16:09.886
Deuce.

1:16:12.495 --> 1:16:13.483
- Sweet!
- Yeah!

1:16:14.463 --> 1:16:17.490
- Out!
- What? It was on the line!

1:16:17.566 --> 1:16:21.797
The call stands.
Too close to overrule. Advantage Tremble.

1:16:22.772 --> 1:16:24.739
Jesus Christ, Ump!

1:16:24.807 --> 1:16:29.003
Whose dick do we have to suck
to get some fucking calls around here?

1:16:29.076 --> 1:16:33.307
That's a warning, Coach.
Next rule violation will be a point penalty.

1:16:36.348 --> 1:16:38.817
Easy, big fellow. Easy.

1:16:40.953 --> 1:16:45.388
Quiet down, please.
Quiet, please. Thank you.

1:16:54.131 --> 1:16:59.124
That's it, Cappy! No free points!
Not today! No free points!

1:16:59.234 --> 1:17:00.565
Game Tremble.

1:17:00.602 --> 1:17:05.006
The score for first set tie-breaker
is now five serving five.

1:17:09.445 --> 1:17:10.535
Shit! What the fuck?

1:17:11.744 --> 1:17:13.872
Have some respect for the game, please!

1:17:13.947 --> 1:17:17.907
Warning, Southpoint.
Next violation will be a point penalty.

1:17:17.984 --> 1:17:18.973
Cappy!

1:17:20.819 --> 1:17:22.810
Stand inside the service box for the return.

1:17:22.890 --> 1:17:25.914
His serve will hit my feet!
No way. It's set point.

1:17:25.992 --> 1:17:29.289
Am I the fucking coach of this team or not?
Do it!

1:17:32.865 --> 1:17:33.991
Go for it, Tommy!

1:17:34.065 --> 1:17:37.033
Five serving six. Set point, West.

1:17:41.005 --> 1:17:42.097
Out!

1:17:42.172 --> 1:17:44.833
Damn it, Tommy! Don't kill it! Just get it in!

1:17:44.906 --> 1:17:46.465
Second service.

1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:53.871
Yes!

1:17:55.250 --> 1:17:57.549
First set goes to Lincoln West.

1:18:06.592 --> 1:18:09.857
Game Tremble.
Southpoint leads four games to one.

1:18:09.928 --> 1:18:11.794
Come on, keep that leg loose, Cappy!

1:18:13.164 --> 1:18:15.531
Set point, Southpoint.

1:18:22.373 --> 1:18:24.466
Second set goes to Tremble.

1:18:24.542 --> 1:18:27.841
Players, you've got 15 minutes
before the final set.

1:18:29.445 --> 1:18:30.433
Hey!

1:18:31.013 --> 1:18:32.140
What the hell happened out there?

1:18:32.214 --> 1:18:35.514
- His leg's cramping.
- Looks more like menstrual cramps!

1:18:35.584 --> 1:18:38.848
Let's stay positive!
Mike's gonna get this bastard in the third.

1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:40.386
You actually think he can beat Tommy

1:18:40.454 --> 1:18:43.686
after shitting all over the court
the whole second set?

1:18:43.759 --> 1:18:45.521
Nobody's shitting on anybody's courts!

1:18:45.593 --> 1:18:46.923
I don't know what match you were watching,

1:18:46.994 --> 1:18:49.519
- but from where I was standing, it sure...
- Hey!

1:18:49.597 --> 1:18:52.565
I'm about to play the biggest set of tennis
of my whole fucking life.

1:18:52.632 --> 1:18:53.723
Is that okay with you, Dad?

1:18:53.799 --> 1:18:57.496
Or would you like me to run away
like you do when things get tough?

1:19:03.073 --> 1:19:04.939
Pretty impressive back there, Cappy.

1:19:05.009 --> 1:19:07.774
I don't think I could have said that
to my dad.

1:19:08.479 --> 1:19:11.469
- Thanks, Coach.
- It's no good. Your legs are burning up.

1:19:11.547 --> 1:19:14.277
We've got to get your core body temp down.

1:19:15.352 --> 1:19:18.114
- Take your clothes off.
- What?

1:19:18.186 --> 1:19:21.349
Come on! Hurry! We only have
a few minutes. You need a cold shower.

1:19:21.423 --> 1:19:23.687
- No, no, I don't...
- No time to argue.

1:19:23.757 --> 1:19:26.624
- Okay! Okay, I'll do it.
- Hurry!

1:19:34.835 --> 1:19:38.565
You get back out there, you get to the net
every point. Chip and charge.

1:19:38.638 --> 1:19:41.401
You don't have the legs
to work the baseline.

1:19:41.472 --> 1:19:43.272
- Okay.
- Constant pressure.

1:19:43.343 --> 1:19:46.904
Come in tight and cut off his angles.
Make him play our game.

1:19:46.979 --> 1:19:49.208
Show him how the big boys play hardball.

1:19:49.281 --> 1:19:50.303
Okay.

1:19:50.380 --> 1:19:51.371
Cappy, you pull this off,

1:19:51.451 --> 1:19:54.419
I'll pay Steffi Nash to let you do her
up the poo.

1:19:55.719 --> 1:19:57.744
That's enough. We're late.

1:20:03.658 --> 1:20:06.355
- Cappy!
- Jesus, Coach!

1:20:06.429 --> 1:20:10.557
You can't put those sweaty clothes back on.
They're weighing you down.

1:20:10.632 --> 1:20:13.031
- Wear mine.
- Oh, no. No, no, Coach!

1:20:13.101 --> 1:20:16.467
- Please, don't make me do that.
- Don't make it weird, Cappy.

1:20:16.536 --> 1:20:20.199
This is state, God damn it!
You need fresh clothes! Put them on!

1:20:20.273 --> 1:20:23.265
- Those aren't fresh!
- They're fine! Let's go!

1:20:24.678 --> 1:20:26.075
Put them on.

1:20:32.216 --> 1:20:33.444
Oh, God.

1:20:49.699 --> 1:20:51.255
Game, West.

1:21:02.344 --> 1:21:04.038
Game, Southpoint.

1:21:18.823 --> 1:21:20.916
Shit! Jenny, we need a trainer!

1:21:21.526 --> 1:21:24.120
- How long for an injury time-out?
- Three minutes.

1:21:24.194 --> 1:21:27.323
If your player cannot continue, it's a default.

1:21:29.933 --> 1:21:32.730
- Is he still locked up?
- Yeah, he is.

1:21:32.802 --> 1:21:33.929
Shit!

1:21:34.704 --> 1:21:36.693
God damn it! We got a man down out there

1:21:36.773 --> 1:21:38.966
and you guys are just sitting around
tossing each other's salads?

1:21:39.041 --> 1:21:40.668
- What should we do?
- Well, Jesus H., Chang!

1:21:40.742 --> 1:21:43.142
You're so ever-loving smart, figure it out!

1:21:43.210 --> 1:21:44.973
Grow a pair and do something!

1:21:45.212 --> 1:21:46.612
Come here, come here. Come here.

1:21:46.681 --> 1:21:49.580
Damn it, Cappy. This is it. Get up, man!

1:21:57.490 --> 1:21:59.753
- Come on, Mike!
- You can do it, Mike!

1:21:59.825 --> 1:22:02.293
- Let's go, Son!
- You can do it, Bro!

1:22:02.359 --> 1:22:03.885
Mikey... Get back up!

1:22:05.630 --> 1:22:07.291
Mike! Mike!

1:22:10.468 --> 1:22:14.029
Mike, you bitch! Get up
and rip this motherfucker's butt open!

1:22:14.104 --> 1:22:17.836
And make him lick his own shit
off your huge fucking cock!

1:22:21.344 --> 1:22:23.573
She really misses her mother.

1:22:32.419 --> 1:22:35.014
It's time to Cherokee it up, God damn it.

1:22:35.922 --> 1:22:37.583
Come on, Mike.

1:22:39.191 --> 1:22:42.457
Jesus, man! Put that thing in its holster!
Concentrate!

1:22:42.528 --> 1:22:45.394
Sorry, Coach. She's got great hands.

1:22:47.299 --> 1:22:48.732
Time. Resume play.

1:22:48.801 --> 1:22:51.429
It's almost over. You got him, buddy.

1:22:54.171 --> 1:22:55.638
Find me, Mike.

1:22:56.875 --> 1:22:58.466
I'm in the now.

1:22:59.309 --> 1:23:02.766
Be here. Lose your flow.

1:23:06.850 --> 1:23:09.977
Thirty all. Quiet, please. Quiet.

1:23:17.057 --> 1:23:18.684
Thirty serving 40.

1:23:19.927 --> 1:23:20.951
Cappy!

1:23:21.028 --> 1:23:23.428
Not like that. Not on match point. Back it up.

1:23:28.501 --> 1:23:29.559
Out.

1:23:29.636 --> 1:23:32.069
Second service. Match point, West.

1:23:47.384 --> 1:23:49.944
Get there, bitch.

1:23:55.757 --> 1:23:59.125
Game, set, match, West High!

1:23:59.228 --> 1:24:00.593
Holy shit!

1:24:00.628 --> 1:24:01.959
Yeah!

1:24:02.797 --> 1:24:03.820
He did it!

1:24:04.031 --> 1:24:06.592
- Nice match. Way to dig deep.
- Thanks, Tommy.

1:24:07.100 --> 1:24:08.465
Mike did it!

1:24:17.510 --> 1:24:20.774
We're the winning team!
I'm part of a winning team!

1:25:03.581 --> 1:25:04.913
Hey, Coach.

1:25:05.650 --> 1:25:08.642
- Why the long face, Gary?
- I don't know.

1:25:08.721 --> 1:25:12.780
I've just been so focused
on turning these boys into champions.

1:25:12.856 --> 1:25:17.055
Now that I have, where do I go from here?

1:25:17.630 --> 1:25:20.425
I can't tell you where to go, Gary.

1:25:20.496 --> 1:25:25.229
But I can tell you one thing.
Those boys will never forget this day.

1:25:26.668 --> 1:25:29.569
Days of youth fondly remembered,

1:25:30.906 --> 1:25:32.669
those are worth something.

1:25:32.940 --> 1:25:35.306
Those are worth a hell of a lot.

1:25:36.342 --> 1:25:38.903
- You're a good coach, Gary.
- Really?

1:25:39.445 --> 1:25:41.073
Maybe the best.

1:26:23.250 --> 1:26:27.745
We rub Crotch Horseman!

1:26:29.889 --> 1:26:33.381
No! No, Maricar! No! The lid! The lid!

1:26:57.913 --> 1:27:00.211
Life is just so crazy, Gary.

1:27:00.283 --> 1:27:02.842
You came to Nebraska
to get away from tennis.

1:27:02.918 --> 1:27:06.786
Yet here you are,
basking in the greatness of tennis triumphs.

1:27:07.320 --> 1:27:09.447
You big beautiful old lug.

1:27:09.522 --> 1:27:12.322
Mrs. Tuttle was so lucky to have you.

1:27:12.393 --> 1:27:14.656
Gary, never forget
what Coach T. Taught you...

1:27:14.728 --> 1:27:17.991
that life is short,
and you need to find balance.

1:27:18.063 --> 1:27:23.160
Tennis, while it is the sport of kings,
can never take the place of a good queen.

1:27:48.756 --> 1:27:52.056
Gary, after you marry Norma Sanchez,
you should get a teaching degree.

1:27:52.127 --> 1:27:56.257
I bet you'd turn some dead-end dipshit
into a future president.

1:27:56.330 --> 1:27:58.889
Damn, it's fucking bright out here!

1:28:08.873 --> 1:28:11.068
I love you guys.

1:28:16.879 --> 1:28:27.049
THE END
