WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:04.137
-Previously.
-They want me back, Buffy.
The military.

00:04.171 --> 00:07.841
-This is good-bye?
-Unless you give me a reason
to stay, I'm leaving tonight.

00:11.378 --> 00:12.612
Riley!

00:14.782 --> 00:18.318
-Are we having a conversation?
-What? No!

00:18.352 --> 00:20.153
Maybe.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.589
-We're getting married.
-TARA: Congratulations.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.693
-Double meat is double sweet.
Enjoy!
-Hey, Buffy.

00:25.725 --> 00:28.461
We're here to support your
subsistence-level employment.
Bravo.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.899
TODD:
You see, Buffy,

00:31.931 --> 00:34.335
the thing you gotta learn
about the Palace--

00:34.368 --> 00:37.070
and this takes a while--

00:37.104 --> 00:40.908
is that job security
all boils down
to one simple thing.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.445
Politics. Now, I'm not
a political animal,

00:45.478 --> 00:46.780
But you learn fast
around here,

00:46.814 --> 00:49.350
or it's-- wham!
Hello, glass ceiling.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.753
I mean, it's not like
we work at Burger World
or The Happy Bun

00:52.786 --> 00:54.921
where the power structure
is simple.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.223
No. Here at the Palace,
you gotta keep

00:56.256 --> 00:59.692
your friends close,
but your enemies... closer.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.960
It's like Machiavelli says--

01:02.896 --> 01:04.632
You know Machiavelli, right?

01:04.665 --> 01:06.534
Tall guy, bleached mullet,
works day shifts?

01:06.567 --> 01:09.403
I'm sorry. My bad.
I keep forgetting
you dropped out of college.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.739
-I'm reapplying.
-Good luck with that.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.974
Well, gotta motor.
Don't wanna be late
for night school.

01:15.007 --> 01:17.745
-You go to night school?
-I'm working on my M.B.A.

01:17.777 --> 01:19.947
Think I wanna spend
the rest of my life
cleaning grease traps?

01:19.980 --> 01:22.615
Ooh. Don't forget to lock up
before you go.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.551
And the gum under the tables--

01:24.585 --> 01:26.486
be sure to give it
a good scrape before you leave.

01:26.519 --> 01:28.456
-May I?
-See you tomorrow.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.623
Yes, you will.

01:30.658 --> 01:33.394
And the day after that,
and the day after that,

01:33.426 --> 01:35.628
and the day after that.

01:35.662 --> 01:39.167
* Get the double treat
that's so double sweet *

01:39.200 --> 01:42.670
* Oh, it's hard to beat
when the meat meets-- *

01:42.703 --> 01:46.140
Oh! Why can I not get
that stupid jingle
out of my head?

01:46.174 --> 01:48.776
Least of your problems now,
little girl.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.009
Wait.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.679
Okay.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.847
Okay, let's do this.
Quickly.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.019
(snarling)

02:03.224 --> 02:05.325
What's that smell?
(sniffing)

02:05.358 --> 02:08.794
-Geez, Slayer!
Is that you?
-I've been working.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.865
-Where, in a slaughterhouse?
-Doublemeat Palace.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.033
Oh.

02:14.067 --> 02:17.103
You know what?
Let's just
call it a night.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.539
If it's all the same to you--
and you've been eatin'
that stuff--

02:19.573 --> 02:21.108
I'm not so sure
I wanna bite you.

02:21.140 --> 02:24.944
You're dead.
You smell like it.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.181
How do you get to say
I'm the one who's stinky?

02:27.215 --> 02:30.183
Really, it-it's cool.
I'll just catch you
next time.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.353
Aw!

02:36.356 --> 02:38.526
(sniffing)

02:48.201 --> 02:49.437
(theme music playing)

03:41.954 --> 03:43.424
(sighs)

03:45.325 --> 03:46.560
(rustling)

03:46.593 --> 03:49.462
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Spike.

03:49.497 --> 03:52.365
Ah, it's a fair cop.
You caught me, Slayer.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.602
However, in all honesty,

03:54.634 --> 03:56.336
I think we have to say
this one doesn't count.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.272
After all, I wasn't
exactly hiding.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.776
No, Spike.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.312
"No"? What kind of answer
is that?

04:05.346 --> 04:08.316
-You haven't even heard
the question yet.
-I don't have to.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.884
We both know
what you're thinking.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.353
And we both know that I'm not
the only one thinking it.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.889
No. Not here.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.625
Why not?

04:18.658 --> 04:20.461
Dawn.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.230
She's inside
waiting for dinner.
She's counting on me.

04:23.262 --> 04:25.798
I'm not letting her down
by letting you in.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.302
So it's the fear of getting
caught then, is it?

04:28.336 --> 04:30.670
Reason number one
on a very long list.

04:30.704 --> 04:34.141
-It needn't be an obstacle.
-Spike, I mean it.
Come on.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.175
I hear. You're serious.
So am I.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.480
I want you.
You want me.

04:39.512 --> 04:42.850
I can't go inside, so...

04:42.882 --> 04:46.720
maybe the time is right...
for you to come outside.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.860
(sighs)

05:04.338 --> 05:06.273
Dawn.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.709
Hey. Hi.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.143
Rough night?

05:10.177 --> 05:11.612
The usual.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.514
I-I brought you dinner.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.314
Oh, great.

05:15.348 --> 05:16.417
Oh.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.389
I-- I know it's not
the most original these days,

05:21.422 --> 05:23.391
but I made it myself.

05:23.423 --> 05:27.360
I made hundreds, actually,
but this is the very best one.

05:27.394 --> 05:30.230
It looks kinda squished.

05:30.262 --> 05:34.300
Oh! Well, just--
You know, just...
give it a sec.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.004
These babies really
bounce back, literally.

05:38.738 --> 05:41.975
Buffy, it-it's not like
I don't appreciate it.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.677
I do.
It's just that--

05:44.711 --> 05:48.247
I can't eat this stuff
another night.
I'm sorry.

05:48.281 --> 05:51.819
Oh. No. It's all good.

05:51.851 --> 05:55.389
I get it. Tell you what,
tomorrow night, I'll, uh,

05:55.423 --> 05:58.158
I'll bring home the Fisherman's
Nuggets with Cheese.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.093
Hey, workin' lady.
Rough night?

06:01.127 --> 06:03.029
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

06:03.062 --> 06:06.199
No reason.
I just thought you were
busy with the slayage

06:06.233 --> 06:07.767
'cause of
that grass stain.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.004
Some vamp get rough
with you?

06:11.038 --> 06:14.074
-He's not getting
any gentler.
-"He"?

06:14.106 --> 06:16.877
They. Them.

06:16.910 --> 06:21.348
You know, vampires in
the "general population" sense.

06:21.380 --> 06:24.518
(sighs)
Now I'm gonna have
to wash this.

06:24.552 --> 06:27.954
Ready for a bold suggestion?
Blow it off.

06:27.987 --> 06:30.122
Dawnie and I are headed
out to The Bronze.

06:30.156 --> 06:33.192
Um, do I have your permission?
And wanna come along?

06:33.225 --> 06:35.795
(chuckles) You like how I
slipped in that permission
request like that?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.697
Very smooth.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.932
You guys go.

06:39.966 --> 06:43.136
-Really?
-Buffy, are you sure?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.439
It might do you good
to get away from

06:45.473 --> 06:47.608
the Doublemeat lifestyle
for a night.

06:47.641 --> 06:51.077
-See your friends.
-Who'd love to see you.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.880
I'm sure. I have seen
enough action for one night.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.483
-Home by 11:00.
-On the dot.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.151
Have a good time.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.127
Somebody should.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.932
(people chattering)

07:12.966 --> 07:15.603
See, the seating chart
makes no sense.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.137
We have to do it again.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.807
We can't do it again.
You do it.

07:19.839 --> 07:21.440
The seating chart's fine.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.610
Let's get back
to the table arrangements.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.646
I'm starting to have dreams
of gardenia bouquets.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.584
I am so glad
my manly coworkers didn't
just hear me say that.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.252
Will you stop
wolfing down those chips?

07:32.284 --> 07:34.654
One more bag and you'll pop
right out of your cummerbund.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.692
You're not even hungry.
You're just nervous.

07:38.725 --> 07:41.194
Yeah! Wedding--
one week.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.764
We have friends, family,
demons flying in,

07:43.797 --> 07:45.432
a "to do" list
getting no shorter--

07:45.465 --> 07:48.134
And do not...
take my chips.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.471
Hey, guys. How's
the soon-to-be newlyweds?

07:51.504 --> 07:53.305
-Nervous?
-BOTH: No!

07:55.207 --> 07:57.911
Okay. I'll just
be over here then.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.182
Your Arnold Palmer,
milady.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.853
Thanks. So, how are
Mr. and Mrs. High-strung?

08:06.887 --> 08:09.189
I'm betting they explode.

08:09.221 --> 08:11.290
You know, when I was little,
I used to spend hours

08:11.324 --> 08:14.026
imagining what my wedding
to Xander would be like.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.829
And now I look at them...

08:16.863 --> 08:19.365
I just think--
nee hee hee!

08:19.399 --> 08:23.336
-(laughs) You're awfully
chipper tonight.
-Can't hide it.

08:23.370 --> 08:27.675
Mm! Big wedding coming up.
Lots of date possibilities.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.077
You and Tara
are speaking again.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.913
-You wanna call her,
invite her over?
-Uh, no.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.182
Too soon for so bold
a maneuver.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.918
But if I did call,
she wouldn't hang up on me.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.921
That's progress.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.889
Hence the happy.

08:42.923 --> 08:45.692
* I'll never get
close to you *

08:45.725 --> 08:50.096
* And I'm just
too distracted to try *

08:52.432 --> 08:56.269
* Pain is a rain

08:58.772 --> 09:02.042
-(vehicle rumbling)
-(objects clattering)

09:03.943 --> 09:05.511
Garbage.

09:05.544 --> 09:06.379
Oh!

09:08.581 --> 09:10.417
BUFFY:
Wait! Wait up, guys!

09:12.620 --> 09:15.087
Wait! Oh!

09:15.121 --> 09:16.889
(sighs)

09:19.491 --> 09:21.761
Don't you want
your garbage?

09:35.008 --> 09:37.110
Hey, Buffy.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.846
Oh, don't forget.
Today's trash day.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.248
Thanks.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.388
BUFFY: "Dear Ms. Summers,
We are sorry to reject--"

09:48.421 --> 09:49.722
What's that?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.892
Nothing.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.426
Huh.

09:54.494 --> 09:55.629
Bronze was fun last night,

09:55.663 --> 09:57.898
in a total
home-by-elevenish way.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.067
-You should've come.
-Maybe next time.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.004
-Where are you going?
-School.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.841
Oh. That's good.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.809
Don't you want
breakfast first?

10:09.842 --> 10:12.245
Already made it.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.981
See you this afternoon,
unless you're working.

10:15.014 --> 10:18.284
Tonight then, or,
you know, tomorrow's cool.

10:18.317 --> 10:19.552
Don't work too hard.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.855
Bye.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.658
-(door opens, closes)
-(sighs)

10:25.692 --> 10:28.528
(inhales deeply, exhales)

10:32.499 --> 10:36.269
And that's where even
your best political minds
can drop the ball.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.206
Zeitgeist. You're not taking
the pulse of the public,
next thing you know,

10:39.239 --> 10:42.274
you're L.B.J.
handing the house keys
over to Nixon.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.144
Heard back
from your college yet?

10:45.177 --> 10:46.546
Yeah.

10:46.578 --> 10:49.682
All right. You know,
we're out of special sauce.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.618
I'll get it.

10:51.650 --> 10:55.022
No, no. Your turn up front.
I'll deal back here.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.724
You take the customers.

10:59.692 --> 11:01.828
Welcome to
the Doublemeat Palace.
How may I help--

11:03.363 --> 11:05.498
You.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.701
Hey.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.601
Huh?

11:17.177 --> 11:20.480
-Riley.
-Sorry to just drop in
on you like this, Buffy.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.215
-It's you.
-It's me.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.984
-You're here.
-I know.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.485
And... were you always
this tall?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.822
Look, this isn't
the way I wanted it,

11:28.855 --> 11:30.923
but something's come up,
something big, and we
don't have much time.

11:30.957 --> 11:34.326
-You understand?
-Not a word
you've said so far.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.197
Right.
I should've known,
anticipated.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.332
-You're working.
-Well, just counter.
Not grill anymore.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.235
I want to explain.
I just don't have time.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.669
I've been up
for 48 hours straight

11:43.702 --> 11:45.205
tracking something bad.
Now it's come to Sunnydale.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.139
My hat has a cow.

11:49.109 --> 11:52.578
I know that I'm putting you
on the spot showing up
like this, but--

11:52.611 --> 11:55.115
But, you know, here we are.
I need the best.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.917
I need you, Buffy.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.284
Can you help me?

11:59.919 --> 12:02.054
Hello! Buffy?
People are waiting.

12:06.458 --> 12:09.096
Buffy, I--
Buffy, wait!

12:09.129 --> 12:11.264
Buffy!

12:11.298 --> 12:14.234
Look, I'm sorry
this is all so sudden.

12:14.267 --> 12:18.605
-You know, if we get a minute,
I'd really like to sit down--
-(device rings)

12:18.638 --> 12:20.807
-What is it?
-Suvolte demon.

12:20.841 --> 12:24.211
Rare, lethal.
Nearly extinct,
but not nearly enough.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.245
-It's close.
-(laughing)

12:26.278 --> 12:27.914
What?

12:27.947 --> 12:29.883
Sorry.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.085
It's just--

12:32.119 --> 12:34.855
You still carry around
all that James Bond stuff.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.323
It's so cute.
I forgot.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.828
Sorry. Carry on.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.897
We've been tear-assing
through every jungle

12:43.931 --> 12:46.066
from Paraguay up,
taking out nests.

12:46.099 --> 12:50.302
As soon as we put
one Suvolte down,
a dozen take its place.

12:50.336 --> 12:51.471
They're breeders, Buffy.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.240
One turns into 10.
Ten become a hundred.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.308
This gets out of hand
and there's a war
with humans,

12:56.342 --> 12:58.445
the humans
are gonna lose.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.447
So they're like
really mean tribbles.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.484
Sorry. I've been dealing
with these-- these geeks.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.753
It's-- It's a whole thing.

13:06.785 --> 13:09.121
-(snarling)
-(people screaming)

13:09.155 --> 13:12.792
-You ready for this?
-Yes, please.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.294
National Forestry Service!
We got a wild bear!

13:15.327 --> 13:17.998
Everybody stand back!
Look out!

13:45.993 --> 13:47.995
Split?

13:54.701 --> 13:57.037
-Riley!
-(demon snarling)

14:04.844 --> 14:06.013
You all right?

14:06.046 --> 14:08.248
I'll feel better
when we catch it.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.749
It's too fast.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.583
I wouldn't
necessarily say that.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.725
Nice wheels.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.894
Came with the car.

14:20.927 --> 14:23.663
-Know where we're goin'?
-Got an idea.
The tag's online.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.698
-We'll find it.
-How's your arm?

14:26.732 --> 14:29.336
It'll heal.
How you doing?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.703
-Complicated question.
-I just meant--

14:31.738 --> 14:33.941
-I know.
-I hear ya.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.909
I got some, uh, big stories
to tell you, too,

14:36.943 --> 14:38.912
if we ever get
half a second.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.947
-Did you die?
-No.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.615
I'm gonna win.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.816
(sighs)

14:48.956 --> 14:51.624
Here. No offense,
but this is black ops,

14:51.658 --> 14:53.293
and you look like
a pylon.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.864
-Ninja wear?
-Battle gear.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.899
Lightweight Kevlar--
state of the art.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.769
-What a surprise.
-Boys like toys.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.437
Put it on.
Thank me later.

15:06.105 --> 15:08.908
-You won't look?
-I'm a gentleman.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.144
Okay.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.980
So...

15:14.014 --> 15:17.049
the black ops life,
it's working out for you?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.217
Don't suck.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.852
-They got dental?
-Yeah. We're covered.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.528
You know, there's not
many people I'd ask to risk
their life for me, Buffy.

15:29.962 --> 15:33.732
-It's really good
to see you.
-Thanks.

15:33.765 --> 15:35.268
You're welcome.

15:36.668 --> 15:40.273
And, Buffy,
love the hair.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.816
I think we died in this car
on the way to the airport,
and now we're stuck in hell.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.817
The radio said
no traffic.

15:51.850 --> 15:54.620
It's a hell radio.
Of course it said so.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.789
We'll never get
to the airport in time
to pick up your stupid uncle.

15:57.823 --> 16:00.759
It just gives my Uncle Rory
more time at the bar.
Trust me. He'll be happy.

16:00.793 --> 16:05.298
Great. So he can sleep off
his drunken stupor on our
newly reupholstered couch.

16:05.331 --> 16:08.801
-He can't afford a hotel.
-Why are you defending him?

16:08.835 --> 16:13.005
I'm not.
I hate my uncle.
I hate my whole family.

16:13.039 --> 16:15.042
That's why
I'm marrying you--
to start a new family,

16:15.075 --> 16:17.443
have children,
make them hate us.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.178
Then one day,
they'll get married,

16:19.211 --> 16:21.780
we'll sleep on their couch.
It's the circle of life.

16:21.813 --> 16:24.850
Well, the Gnarals
are teleporting in
in 20 minutes.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.820
If I'm not there to greet them,
somebody's getting incinerated.

16:27.854 --> 16:31.057
Why did we ever agree
to have your friends,
who are demons,

16:31.091 --> 16:33.692
and my family,
who are monsters,
stay at our place?

16:33.725 --> 16:36.229
Well, I can only do
so much, Xander.

16:36.263 --> 16:39.566
Planning this marriage
is like staging
the invasion of Normandy.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.068
Without the laughs.
We should have eloped.

16:42.101 --> 16:45.371
No! I've been
through too much
planning this wedding,

16:45.404 --> 16:47.539
and it is going to happen.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.341
It is going to be
our perfect, perfect day

16:49.375 --> 16:52.345
if I have to kill
every one of our guests
and half this town to do it.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.681
Hmm. Cool Ranch?

16:54.713 --> 16:56.349
Cajun Fiesta.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.528
End of the line?

17:09.895 --> 17:11.431
I don't see our demon.

17:11.463 --> 17:12.798
It's not here.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.701
Let me guess.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.615
BUFFY:
Down we go?

17:28.647 --> 17:32.050
-Looks that way.
-That's a big first step.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.954
So, Mr. Finn,
got an extra jet pack
for a girl like me?

17:35.988 --> 17:39.592
Sorry. Fresh out of jet packs.
Looks like we'll have to share.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.861
This test line's built for one,
so if we go together,

17:41.894 --> 17:43.529
and we're not hauling
any gear--

17:43.563 --> 17:46.598
-It'll just be you and me.
-I was never big
on the hardware anyway.

17:46.633 --> 17:50.237
-You hold on to me?
-If that's what it takes.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.438
Come on.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.509
Ready when you are,
Agent Finn.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.700
(water running)

18:36.215 --> 18:37.517
(snarling)

18:54.733 --> 18:55.835
Riley!

19:00.173 --> 19:01.473
(gasps)

19:11.917 --> 19:15.521
Hey. Hey there.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.557
What exactly are you doing
with my husband?

19:30.269 --> 19:32.070
"Husband"?

19:34.606 --> 19:36.509
Wife.

19:39.912 --> 19:45.352
And those aren't code names
like Big Dog or Falcon or--

19:45.384 --> 19:47.686
I didn't think so.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.757
Buffy, meet Sam.
Sam, Buffy.

19:50.789 --> 19:53.326
-Pleasure.
-Demon.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.594
-(snarling)
-Mine.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.932
-She's good.
-She's a special one.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.035
How long have
you been married?

20:03.068 --> 20:04.570
Four months almost.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.338
Mazel tov.

20:06.373 --> 20:10.041
-Any children?
-Buffy, I meant to tell you
when the time was right.

20:10.076 --> 20:13.380
And she caught up to us
a hell of a lot faster than
I would've guessed possible.

20:13.413 --> 20:17.215
-She does that.
-So you-- you guys
do this often,

20:17.250 --> 20:21.721
you know, the whole
"husband-wife tag team
demon-fighting" thing?

20:21.753 --> 20:23.055
Yeah, it's what
brought us together.

20:23.088 --> 20:24.723
I almost feel sorry
for the Suvolte.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.394
Not quite.

20:41.973 --> 20:44.844
-Call this
your wedding gift.
-(snap)

20:46.578 --> 20:51.017
(exhales)
So, guess that's
"mission accomplished."

20:52.751 --> 20:54.787
She killed it.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.923
Oh, honey.
That's okay.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.626
"Okay"?

21:02.795 --> 21:06.298
Wait. You guys have been
tracking this thing

21:06.333 --> 21:08.401
as a couple
for two days straight,

21:08.434 --> 21:10.803
and you did
want it dead, right?

21:14.606 --> 21:15.741
Oh.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.808
Let me guess.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.412
Captain Can-do over here
forgot to mention

21:19.445 --> 21:22.013
that this was
a homing operation.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.982
But it's nice to finally
meet you, by the way.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.284
Knife.

21:26.385 --> 21:27.519
What is a homing operation?

21:27.554 --> 21:30.356
It's my fault.
I should've explained.

21:30.390 --> 21:33.492
That would've saved me
some... trouble.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.126
Damn.

21:36.863 --> 21:41.334
We're too late.
Finn, how could you
recruit the Slayer

21:41.367 --> 21:43.802
without filling her in
on the objective?

21:43.836 --> 21:45.471
That'd be my question.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.507
If we weren't under
severe time constraints,

21:47.539 --> 21:49.942
I'd seriously think about
ripping you a new one.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.076
Stand down, soldier.

21:52.243 --> 21:53.712
He's your boss too?

21:53.746 --> 21:55.146
Oh, he wishes.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.148
We better regroup.

21:57.182 --> 21:59.786
Buffy, I'd hate
to impose further,

21:59.818 --> 22:02.521
but...
you got a safe house?

22:02.555 --> 22:04.856
I-- I have a house.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.959
I-- I think it's safe.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.760
Sometimes
you can't even leave.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.865
-Um--
-I know the way.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.233
And I'll fill you in.
On everything.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.906
Sorry the place
is such a mess.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.909
I haven't had a chance
to give it a good clean.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.210
RILEY:
Hey.

22:24.242 --> 22:26.211
DAWN:
Agent Finn returns.

22:26.244 --> 22:28.314
Dawn. Geez, look at you.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.882
I think you grew
a foot and a half.

22:29.915 --> 22:31.116
A lot can happen in a year.

22:32.951 --> 22:34.820
Well, it's good to see you.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.757
Hey, there's the man!
Life taker, heartbreaker.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.659
You know,
figuratively speaking.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.894
-Xander, Sam. Willow.
-Hi.

22:41.927 --> 22:44.997
-Hi.
-We got your call.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.165
We're here to help.
Just like old times.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.001
Except with you being all big
with the married life.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.202
Hear you're gettin'
hitched yourself.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.939
Believe me,
you're gonna love it.

22:52.971 --> 22:55.141
Congratulations.
Really. Both of you.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.078
Just so you know,

23:00.112 --> 23:02.548
I'm prepared
to hate this woman
any way you want.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.584
Thanks, but no.

23:04.616 --> 23:06.586
I don't wanna seem
all petty.

23:06.618 --> 23:09.788
Well, that's the beauty.
You can't, but I can.

23:09.821 --> 23:13.358
Please. Let me carry
the hate for the both of us.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.027
(both chuckling)

23:15.060 --> 23:16.628
Go nuts.

23:18.597 --> 23:21.468
So, what brings you
back to town

23:21.500 --> 23:23.536
after you left suddenly
with no word?

23:23.569 --> 23:27.473
(sighs) Sam and I have been
tracking a Suvolte demon
through Central America.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.909
Killing machine,
nearly mature.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.077
SAM: Yeah.
Three months old
and growing fast.

23:32.111 --> 23:35.213
These things start to kill
the minute they're hatched
and leave a real clear trail.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.215
Yeah. Just follow the villages

23:37.249 --> 23:39.085
with nothin' in 'em
but body parts.

23:39.117 --> 23:43.088
Uh, Dawn, are you sure
you want to be around
hearing all this?

23:43.122 --> 23:44.222
Oh, come on, Finn.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.325
She looks all grown up to me.

23:46.357 --> 23:48.795
That is, if it's
all right with you?

23:48.827 --> 23:51.963
Uh, sure.
Yeah, that's fine.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.265
So this demon
shredded your guys,

23:53.298 --> 23:56.167
and now you're looking
for a little payback?

23:56.201 --> 24:00.138
No. It came here
to the Hellmouth to spawn.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.441
But we think it already
hatched its eggs somewhere.

24:02.474 --> 24:05.176
And the plan was to track it,
let the demon take us
to its nest.

24:05.211 --> 24:09.781
And now they're going
to hatch a bunch of
baby demon things?

24:09.816 --> 24:13.184
-Unless we stop it.
-Which means we have
to find the nest and fast,

24:13.219 --> 24:15.622
before Sunnydale turns into
the "Troublemeat" Palace.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.959
I wish I'd said
something else.

24:19.991 --> 24:22.662
Okay, so we track down
the demon, find the nest.

24:22.694 --> 24:25.998
Mr. and Mrs. Finn here
make with the killin',
and everyone goes home happy.

24:26.031 --> 24:28.800
But, seriously, married man,
if forced to choose between,

24:28.835 --> 24:30.301
uh, photographer
and place settings--

24:30.336 --> 24:32.003
We can't track the demon.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.173
I killed it.

24:34.205 --> 24:36.208
So, who's hungry?
We got, uh--

24:36.241 --> 24:38.376
-Ice cubes.
-All you can eat.

24:38.410 --> 24:42.314
Buffy, it's good that
you killed the Suvolte
before it killed us.

24:42.347 --> 24:45.785
-Disposable cameras.
-Di-- Huh?

24:45.817 --> 24:48.988
Yeah, you know,
little plastic ones--
10 bucks a pop.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.856
You arrange 'em like
table settings.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.791
Guests snap photos--
it breaks the ice.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.595
Then when the wedding's over,
you get to take home
the pictures.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.632
I like it.

24:59.665 --> 25:04.036
So, demon eggs--
any timetable on when
we think they're gonna hatch?

25:04.069 --> 25:05.538
Hatching's not the problem.

25:05.571 --> 25:08.307
SAM: We think they're gonna
be sold on the black market.

25:08.339 --> 25:11.711
There's some foreign
military powers that would love
to have their own Suvolte.

25:11.743 --> 25:14.246
You could never train it,
but drop it on an
urban population--

25:14.279 --> 25:15.513
And it cleanses the area.

25:15.548 --> 25:18.349
Is that a nice way of saying
it kills people?

25:18.384 --> 25:21.519
SAM:
Lots of 'em.
Money's been exchanged.

25:21.554 --> 25:25.391
There's a dealer in town.
Calls himself The Doctor.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.594
Willow, you think you can help
with a little locating spell?

25:27.626 --> 25:30.528
I can't do
the magics.

25:30.563 --> 25:33.665
Oh, Riley says you're comin' on
as one major league Wicca.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.901
I got addicted,

25:34.933 --> 25:36.434
the way addicts do.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.539
Two teams.
No civilians.

25:41.574 --> 25:44.611
I'll go out
and look for our doctor.
You two find that nest.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.680
Me and Sam together?

25:47.713 --> 25:49.915
You come across a Suvolte nest,
you're gonna want backup.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.518
You know, I don't want to be
draggin' down the Slayer.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.886
You've got speed and power
I can't even--

25:54.921 --> 25:57.355
Let's go.
Xander, are you okay
to stay with Dawn?

25:57.388 --> 25:59.458
-Yeah.
-RILEY: I'll check out
some bars--

25:59.490 --> 26:02.060
Willy's,
some crypts that I know.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.569
Hey, Willow.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.405
I'm sorry.
I think I really...

26:14.440 --> 26:16.075
stepped in it in there.

26:18.009 --> 26:21.380
Back in the jungle,
we had not one,

26:21.413 --> 26:23.715
but two hardcore shamans
working for us.

26:23.750 --> 26:28.621
They were workin'
the dark magics
and... got addicted.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.357
And now they're gone.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.394
Gone as in...

26:36.427 --> 26:38.998
there's nothing left.

26:39.030 --> 26:43.102
I've never met anyone
with enough strength
to quit before.

26:45.672 --> 26:47.605
I'm just saying.

26:54.180 --> 26:58.017
-SAM: Thanks
for letting me tag along.
-BUFFY: No problem.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.251
Maybe not for you.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.788
I gotta tell you, Buffy.
I'm a little bit
intimidated.

27:02.821 --> 27:05.090
I mean, patrolling with
the real live Slayer.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.661
You're like Santa Claus
or Buddha or something.

27:09.662 --> 27:13.766
-Fat and jolly?
-Legendary.

27:13.799 --> 27:17.403
And it's not just Slayer status
I'm talking about. It's you.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.873
Riley talks about me?

27:22.240 --> 27:25.644
He didn't say anything
for a long time,

27:25.678 --> 27:29.315
but I could tell
he was ripped up inside.

27:29.347 --> 27:31.616
Good thing he has you.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.353
More like miraculous.

27:34.385 --> 27:37.355
I went down to Central America
with the Peace Corps.

27:37.388 --> 27:40.992
One night,
my entire infirmary
got slaughtered by--

27:43.028 --> 27:44.195
I didn't know
what they were.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.464
I got saved,

27:46.498 --> 27:48.968
quit the Corps,
joined the squad.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.103
My first firefight,
I met Riley.

27:52.403 --> 27:54.240
We started talking.
You know,

27:54.272 --> 27:57.343
first about tactics,
missions, stuff like that,

27:57.375 --> 27:59.244
and then about you.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.915
He thinks I let him go.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.186
Do you wish you hadn't?

28:10.021 --> 28:12.090
I wish things were different.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.192
I'm not trying to--

28:14.226 --> 28:15.461
I don't--

28:16.627 --> 28:18.064
You know.

28:19.397 --> 28:21.800
I didn't mean to put you
on the spot, Buffy.

28:24.135 --> 28:26.438
There's no bad guys
in this one.

28:26.471 --> 28:31.242
The only thing
that could help Riley
work it out was time.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.945
Lots of time.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.982
Took him a year
to get over you.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.251
I'm glad he's over me.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.423
So, you seeing anyone new,
someone special?

28:44.455 --> 28:49.095
You know, I just...
take my time, you know.

28:49.127 --> 28:50.930
I don't want to jump
right into anything

28:50.962 --> 28:52.564
and I don't wanna, you know,

28:52.597 --> 28:55.366
be defined by who I'm with.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.436
Yeah. Better no guy
than the wrong guy.
That's for sure.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.539
Sam, you know what?
Um, I think we should split up.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.942
Oh. I'm slowing you down.
I knew I would.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.376
This was just
selfish of me.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.546
No. It's not.

29:07.578 --> 29:12.117
There's this guy,
uh, an informant,
but he's twitchy.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.385
I show up with company,
and we get nothing.

29:14.420 --> 29:18.289
Cool. I'm guessin'
Finn needs me about now.

29:18.324 --> 29:20.592
He's probably off somewhere
gettin' his ass kicked.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.627
You know
how wild he gets.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.430
Don't worry
about Ri and me.
We're good.

29:27.199 --> 29:29.134
I noticed.

29:32.471 --> 29:33.605
(door opening)

29:34.941 --> 29:37.242
Buffy.
Hey, now.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.846
If I'd have known
you were comin',
I'd have baked a cake.

29:39.878 --> 29:42.780
I need information.

29:42.815 --> 29:46.818
Well, I suppose
I could be helpful...
if the price is right.

29:46.853 --> 29:50.088
I'm not sure I'm selling out
at Doublemeat Palace wages
though.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.458
I need to find a guy. Dealer.
Calls himself The Doctor.

29:52.490 --> 29:55.594
-Human?
-His traffic isn't.

29:55.626 --> 29:58.630
-Clock ticking?
-Whatever he's doing,
he's doing it soon.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.868
Soon, but not now?

30:05.570 --> 30:07.138
Tell me you love me.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.276
I love you.

30:10.308 --> 30:11.542
You know I do.

30:11.576 --> 30:13.711
Tell me you want me.

30:13.744 --> 30:16.015
I always want you.

30:17.849 --> 30:19.919
-In point of fact--
-Shut up.

30:46.711 --> 30:49.080
(moaning quietly)

30:56.923 --> 30:59.857
-(door opens)
-(footsteps)

31:01.559 --> 31:03.061
(gasps)

31:03.095 --> 31:05.196
(chuckling)
Well, looky here.

31:07.232 --> 31:09.601
I don't usually use
the word "delicious,"

31:09.634 --> 31:13.905
but I've got a wager
this little tableau
must sting a bit, eh?

31:13.940 --> 31:16.607
Me and your former?
Must kill.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.444
What can I say?

31:19.478 --> 31:21.880
The girl just needs
a little monster
in her, man.

31:21.913 --> 31:25.284
That's not why
I'm here, Doctor.

31:42.433 --> 31:44.569
Oh, God.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.205
(sighs)
Here I thought we'd run
you out of town, mate.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.740
Last time I saw you,
if memory serves,

31:49.775 --> 31:51.876
you were getting the juice
sucked out of you

31:51.910 --> 31:55.447
by some undead ladies
of very questionable
reputation.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.750
Now, be a good tin soldier
and, um--

32:00.451 --> 32:03.088
Where are they,
Doctor?

32:03.122 --> 32:06.057
Where are what?
And why do you keep
calling me that?

32:06.092 --> 32:09.060
Glad to be back in Sunnydale.
Locals all speak English,

32:09.095 --> 32:11.329
and I know who to beat
for information.

32:11.363 --> 32:15.067
-It's all brought me here.
-Look, crew cut,

32:15.101 --> 32:19.505
she's not your bint anymore,
and, if I can speak frankly,

32:19.538 --> 32:21.807
she always
had a little thing for me
even when she was shagging you.

32:21.839 --> 32:24.175
Nice.
That's very distracting.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.345
Now tell me before
I get unprofessional.

32:26.377 --> 32:30.182
-Where are the eggs, Spike?
-Eggs?

32:30.215 --> 32:32.951
(chuckles)
You're off your nut.

32:32.984 --> 32:35.354
It must be those drugs
they were keeping you on.
I did warn you.

32:35.386 --> 32:38.624
Okay, we can do this
the hard way, or we can
do this the fatal way.

32:39.724 --> 32:41.960
Where are the eggs?

32:41.993 --> 32:45.463
-The Doctor--
it can't be Spike.
-No need to defend me, love.

32:48.233 --> 32:51.302
Look, it--
it can't be, okay?

32:51.336 --> 32:54.006
He's too incompetent.
It's just Spike, Riley.

32:54.039 --> 32:57.909
Right. Deadly, amoral,
opportunistic.

32:58.910 --> 33:01.313
Or have you forgotten?

33:01.346 --> 33:04.982
-I'm taking this place apart
until I find that nest.
-Over my dead body.

33:05.017 --> 33:07.618
I've seen enough
of your dead body
for one night, thanks.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.653
Well, you're not--

33:11.890 --> 33:13.025
You coming?

33:19.865 --> 33:24.336
Oh, this is--
Unconstitutional
is what it is!

33:24.369 --> 33:26.738
-Here! There's nothin'
to see down there!
-(grunts)

33:26.771 --> 33:29.575
Riley, look, I'm not saying
that he's good, okay?

33:29.607 --> 33:32.044
I'm just saying that he's not
capable of something as--

33:38.784 --> 33:40.152
I can explain.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.820
We're gonna need more weapons.
Spike screwed up.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.990
You didn't keep 'em frozen,
did you, Doctor?

33:46.023 --> 33:48.727
You can stop
calling me that anytime.

33:48.759 --> 33:50.862
If I may, the thing of it is,

33:50.895 --> 33:53.030
I'm holding these
for a friend who--

33:56.234 --> 33:57.368
No more games.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.208
Well, that's bloody funny
coming from you!

34:02.240 --> 34:04.776
"No more games"?

34:04.809 --> 34:06.944
That's all you've ever done
is play me.

34:06.978 --> 34:09.681
And you keep playing
with the rules you make up
as you like.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.416
You know what I am.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.952
You've always known.

34:13.985 --> 34:15.186
You come to me all the same.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.556
-Can you shut him up?
-Not so far.

34:19.157 --> 34:20.925
-(eggs cracking)
-We better get outta here.

34:22.161 --> 34:24.795
-(squealing)
-(squealing)

34:24.829 --> 34:26.731
On second thought,
stick around.

34:26.764 --> 34:29.367
-Riley, I--
-Aim high!
Plenty of lead!

34:29.400 --> 34:32.003
I'm not exactly Gun Girl.
You wanna live? Learn fast.

34:35.940 --> 34:38.844
-(demons squealing)
-These things-- never useful.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.146
RILEY:
We have to pull out.

34:52.489 --> 34:54.193
-We need a way to contain
these things before--
-Riley!

34:57.762 --> 34:58.664
Get down!

35:08.706 --> 35:10.074
ANYA:
You know, if you love
Riley Finn so much,

35:10.108 --> 35:11.510
maybe you should
just marry him.

35:11.543 --> 35:14.280
He's taken.
And that's not the point.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.681
So, you think their marriage
is better than ours.
Is that it?

35:16.715 --> 35:21.119
No. But granted, I have
a hard time imagining
Nick and Nora Fury...

35:21.152 --> 35:23.188
hiding out from their own
relatives in the bathroom.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.657
-(creature growling)
-(object crashes)

35:25.690 --> 35:27.958
-(sighs)
-(indistinct shouting)

35:27.992 --> 35:32.030
And I have no idea what Riley
and Mrs. Riley's wedding
was like.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.664
Well, you haven't
shut up about them.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.201
Well, they have
a great marriage.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.402
And it bummed Buffy out,
but I can see it.

35:38.503 --> 35:40.639
And, Anya,
I really have no clue

35:40.672 --> 35:41.507
what their wedding was like.

35:42.641 --> 35:43.474
So our wedding...

35:44.976 --> 35:46.978
is not our marriage.

35:47.012 --> 35:49.880
Separate things.
One fills me with a dread

35:49.914 --> 35:51.650
akin to public speaking
engagements.

35:51.682 --> 35:54.385
-And that would be
the wedding.
-Which will be over soon.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.722
-But our marriage--
-That lasts forever.

35:57.922 --> 35:59.190
Ah, well...

35:59.224 --> 36:01.092
that works out nicely then.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.862
-(loud crash)
-(glass shattering)

36:13.371 --> 36:16.007
So, are you and Sam
headed back to Central America,

36:16.041 --> 36:18.210
or is that
classified?

36:19.445 --> 36:20.445
Nepal.

36:22.079 --> 36:23.681
Sounds fun.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.217
I'll send you
a postcard.

36:26.284 --> 36:28.387
-Buffy, listen--
-Riley, I--

36:28.420 --> 36:30.889
By mission parameters,
I'm done here,

36:30.922 --> 36:33.123
but I have authorization
to take The Doctor out.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.262
-You want me to do that?
-Do I want you to--

36:39.797 --> 36:41.699
How can you ask me?

36:43.768 --> 36:45.237
I'm sleeping with him.

36:47.438 --> 36:49.541
I'm sleeping with Spike.

36:49.574 --> 36:51.943
I had actually noticed that.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.914
And then you
come back, and--

36:55.947 --> 36:58.583
And did you wait
until your life was
absolutely perfect

36:58.617 --> 37:01.420
and then send that demon here,
so you could throw it
in my face?

37:01.452 --> 37:03.789
Look, you think
this was easy for me?

37:03.822 --> 37:07.693
Yeah. I think it was
a rollicking adventure.
Fun for the whole family.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.396
I was terrified
about seeing you again.

37:10.429 --> 37:13.498
I'm sure
my incredible pathetic-ness
softened the blow for you.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.802
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:17.835 --> 37:20.438
-Riley, please don't
patronize--
-Hey!

37:20.472 --> 37:23.309
You want me to say
that I liked seeing you
in bed with that idiot?

37:23.342 --> 37:25.143
Or that blinding orange
is your very best color?

37:25.175 --> 37:29.246
Or that that burger smell
is appealing?

37:30.282 --> 37:31.949
You smelled the smell?

37:31.983 --> 37:34.985
Buffy, none of that
means anything.

37:35.085 --> 37:37.422
It doesn't touch you.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.824
You're still the first woman
I ever loved...

37:39.858 --> 37:41.927
and the strongest woman
I've ever known.

37:41.960 --> 37:45.163
Now, I'm not advertising
this to the missus,

37:45.195 --> 37:47.932
but you're still
quite the hottie.

37:47.965 --> 37:50.802
You know, it goes away
after many bathings.

37:50.835 --> 37:52.137
(chuckles)

37:54.105 --> 37:56.775
This isn't about
who's on top.

37:56.807 --> 37:59.143
I know how lucky I am
right now.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.746
I love my work,
and I love my wife.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.681
I know.

38:04.949 --> 38:07.117
And I kind of
love her too.

38:07.152 --> 38:10.021
And so you're not in
the greatest place right now.

38:10.054 --> 38:11.322
And maybe I made it worse.

38:11.356 --> 38:12.657
No.

38:12.690 --> 38:15.092
The wheel never stops
turnin', Buffy.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.362
You're up. You're down.

38:17.396 --> 38:21.032
It doesn't change what you are,
and you are a hell of a woman.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.034
Riley, that night...

38:26.036 --> 38:30.175
I never got the chance
to tell you...

38:30.208 --> 38:33.177
how sorry I was...

38:33.210 --> 38:35.012
about what happened
between us.

38:36.581 --> 38:40.351
And you never have to.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.021
-(door opens)
-Well, the wedding itself was
held in a military chopper

38:43.054 --> 38:45.891
just before a hairy night drop
into hostile territory.

38:45.923 --> 38:47.726
XANDER:
Huh! And just curious,

38:47.759 --> 38:50.061
what's a chopper rental
run these days?

38:50.094 --> 38:52.697
Oh, well, actually,
we commandeered it
from a local guerrilla squad.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.800
-So, cheap.
-Ah.

38:54.833 --> 38:55.867
Yeah.

38:57.735 --> 39:00.371
You have my e-mail.
You promise you'll
keep in touch?

39:00.405 --> 39:02.306
You won't get traced?
I don't wanna lead
the bad guys

39:02.340 --> 39:05.010
to your location
by mistake.

39:05.043 --> 39:09.213
-Our line's secure.
-Oh. Duh. Of course it is.

39:09.246 --> 39:12.583
I keep thinking of you
like regular people,
but, no, you're not.

39:12.617 --> 39:16.387
Oh, right. Like demon-hunting
is all exotic to a girl
from Sunnydale.

39:18.956 --> 39:21.326
So, you gonna
say good-bye
this time or just...

39:21.358 --> 39:23.528
split all secret agenty
like last time?

39:23.561 --> 39:26.231
-(helicopter approaching)
-Depends. I warrant a hug?

39:33.639 --> 39:34.873
Bye, Dawn.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.610
I thought it would
suck less this time.

39:38.643 --> 39:40.244
It doesn't.

39:41.579 --> 39:43.313
It was really nice
meeting you all.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.918
You ready for Nepal, Agent?

39:46.952 --> 39:47.952
Soldier.

39:49.987 --> 39:52.891
Firefights, bug hunts,
big body counts?

39:52.923 --> 39:54.826
Yeah, I could use a break.

40:00.264 --> 40:02.032
-Bye!
-Bye!

40:02.067 --> 40:04.135
XANDER:
Bye, Riley!
Bye, Sam!

40:16.081 --> 40:17.983
What a bitch.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.715
So she's back.

40:52.282 --> 40:54.452
Thought you'd be off
snoggin' with soldier boy.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.322
He's gone.

41:00.492 --> 41:02.360
So you come for a bit
of cold comfort?

41:05.963 --> 41:08.934
The bed's a bit blown up,
but then that was
never our--

41:08.967 --> 41:10.201
I'm not here to--

41:13.739 --> 41:17.643
And I'm not here
to bust your chops about
your stupid scheme either.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.110
That's just you.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.980
I should've remembered.

41:22.012 --> 41:24.349
Oh, this is worse then, is it?
This is you telling me--

41:24.382 --> 41:26.083
It's over.

41:27.818 --> 41:30.221
I've memorized this tune, love.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.724
I think I have the sheet music.

41:32.757 --> 41:34.826
It doesn't change
what you want.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.494
I know that.

41:38.195 --> 41:39.731
I do want you.

41:41.431 --> 41:43.333
Being with you...

41:44.936 --> 41:47.905
makes things simpler...

41:47.938 --> 41:49.974
for a little while.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.844
I don't call
five hours straight
"a little while."

41:52.878 --> 41:54.746
I'm using you.

41:57.583 --> 41:59.217
I can't love you.

42:00.851 --> 42:03.855
I'm just being
weak and selfish--

42:03.889 --> 42:06.490
Really not
complaining here.

42:06.523 --> 42:08.559
And it's killing me.

42:10.929 --> 42:12.931
I have to be strong
about this.

42:17.603 --> 42:20.371
.I'm sorry, William.

42:50.969 --> 42:51.969
(theme music playing)

43:15.960 --> 43:17.829
Grr! Arrgh!
