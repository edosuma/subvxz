kept your cool like that.

00:07.355 --> 00:09.444

with a busted hand?

00:09.487 --> 00:12.621

second-best attributes.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.971
- I think our girl Milena
might be a drug dealer.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.407
- Lieutenant Regina Jeffords.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.018
- What the hell
is going on here?

00:18.061 --> 00:19.410
- She's needed
on the street today.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.586
- This was taken at your
Police Academy graduation.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.414
- Guess it takes one
to know one, huh?

00:23.458 --> 00:25.286
- Dr. Shentu, I was wondering

00:25.329 --> 00:27.331
if you'd like to go
to a concert with me tonight.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.507
- Yes. I would love to go.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.553
- Vasik settled with the feds.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.642
- As whistleblowers,
you are entitled

00:33.685 --> 00:35.513
to a percentage
of the settlement.

00:35.557 --> 00:39.039
- Donated some, but, uh,
I decided to keep the money.

00:41.998 --> 00:45.697
- So word is you and Randall
got together on your day off.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.351
Spill it.

00:47.395 --> 00:48.787
- We had brunch, it was fun.

00:48.831 --> 00:51.051
But it's been a minute
since I've heard from him.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.530
- Maybe he's just busy?

00:52.574 --> 00:53.923
- I have a three-day limit
when it comes to ghosting.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.098
Gotta stick to it.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.404

don't want to get invested

00:56.447 --> 00:57.709

moving on.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.321
- Too bad.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.888
But I guess I would too.

01:02.932 --> 01:04.716
- Patient's Kayla Miller,
ten-day-old newborn.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.718
Fussy, not eating,
copious vomiting,

01:06.762 --> 01:07.980
fever, distended abdomen.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.330
- Labs?
- What you'd expect.

01:09.373 --> 01:10.896
White count's high,
sodium's low,

01:10.940 --> 01:12.159
electrolytes all out of whack.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.117
- How's the ultrasound look?
- Not good.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.640
Was hoping a fresh set of eyes
will help.

01:15.684 --> 01:17.164
- And, uh,
how are the parents doing?

01:17.207 --> 01:19.122
- Young and scared.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.559
Kayla's their first, but they
know something's very wrong.

01:21.603 --> 01:23.474
- Right.

01:23.518 --> 01:25.607
- It's okay, Kayla.

01:25.650 --> 01:26.738
Mommy's here.

01:26.782 --> 01:29.089

this is Dr. Marcel.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.307
- Hi, how are you?

01:30.351 --> 01:31.787
- You'll help our baby?

01:31.830 --> 01:35.399
- I'll do my very best, yeah.
She been crying a lot?

01:35.443 --> 01:37.575
- Yeah,
it's been a couple days.

01:37.619 --> 01:38.707
- Yeah.

01:38.750 --> 01:41.057
Okay, let's figure out
what's going on.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.754
May I?
- Yeah.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.016
- Thank you--hey.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.496
Hi, Kayla.

01:45.540 --> 01:48.108
Hi, sweetheart.
-

01:48.151 --> 01:49.761
- I know, Kayla,
you're uncomfortable.

01:49.805 --> 01:52.286
I'm sorry.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.548
- This is my fault.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.158
I'm breastfeeding her wrong

01:55.202 --> 01:57.291
or messing something else up.
- No.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.336
- Lucy and I,
we don't know what we're doing.

01:59.380 --> 02:00.685
That's why Kayla's sick.

02:00.729 --> 02:03.471
- No, no, no.
She has an infection.

02:03.514 --> 02:06.300
This has nothing to do
with either one of you.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.780
- Hey, Dr. Scott.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.043
Think I'm seeing
the same thing you did.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.610
Pneumatosis.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.221
- Mm-hmm.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.397
- So Kayla's bowel is dilated,

02:16.440 --> 02:18.616
and there's air in the wall
of her small intestine.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.923
I suspect there's a problem
with the blood supply.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.707
- Why?
- I don't know.

02:22.751 --> 02:26.146
But to find out, I'll have
to operate and take a look.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.148
- Surgery?
- Yeah.

02:28.191 --> 02:29.888
- Oh, my God, no.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.282
- She's only ten days old.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.458
- Unfortunately,
surgery's the only way

02:34.502 --> 02:35.981
to figure out what's going on.

02:38.636 --> 02:41.161
- Okay.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.206
- Is there anyone
we can call for you?

02:43.250 --> 02:45.077
Family?

02:45.121 --> 02:46.688
- We don't have any.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.603
- It's--it's just
the three of us.

02:54.870 --> 02:57.873
- No, no, I hear you,
and it sounds interesting.

02:57.916 --> 03:00.180
But, uh, I gotta pass.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.572
It's not for me.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.400
No, Kevin, it--

03:09.101 --> 03:10.668
- Yeah, my cousin.

03:10.712 --> 03:14.237
He's asking for a loan so he
can open a cannabis dispensary.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.586

03:15.630 --> 03:17.327

on Jay's couch, though.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.246

03:23.290 --> 03:24.552
Maybe word will travel.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.641
- No, no, don't get me wrong,
I wanna help.

1.2 million isn't nearly
as much as you'd think.

- Still, that's a nice chunk
of change to play with.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.044

I'm getting out of debt,

04:21.043 --> 04:22.914
It was like her legs

Okay, well,
your muscle tone feels normal,

04:45.285 --> 04:46.938
but clearly, there's a loss
of motor function.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.026
And it just started this week?

04:48.070 --> 04:49.767

05:07.219 --> 05:09.047
- Not sure yet.

05:09.091 --> 05:11.398
Could be a lumbar
or thoracic spine issue.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.269
Or it could be autoimmune.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.793
I'm just speculating,
but Guillain-Barrè Syndrome

05:15.837 --> 05:17.534

Apparently, I don't know
anything about you.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.154
What's next here?

05:29.198 --> 05:31.983

and a neuro consult.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.421
- I'm sorry to take up
so much of your time, Doctor.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.901
- Please, Ms. Patel, you have
nothing to be sorry about.

05:38.773 --> 05:42.472
- So Kayla has what's called
a necrotizing enterocolitis.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.909
The condition inflames
the intestinal tissue

05:44.953 --> 05:46.694
and causes it to die.

05:46.737 --> 05:48.173
- In Kayla's case,
we suspect

05:48.217 --> 05:50.175
it's the result of
a birth defect

05:50.219 --> 05:51.960
that prevented her intestines
from developing

05:52.003 --> 05:53.440
the way they should have
during pregnancy.

- No.

06:10.413 --> 06:13.721
They're temporary,
not a solution.

06:16.419 --> 06:17.986
- What is?

06:18.029 --> 06:20.945
- A transplant.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.470
Kayla cannot survive
without new intestines.

06:23.513 --> 06:26.037
Unfortunately,

09:15.163 --> 09:16.338
barely leave the house,
and somehow,

09:16.381 --> 09:18.732
I'm always fighting something.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.342
Maybe I'm being too cautious.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.039
- No, no,
I like what you're doing.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.128
Unfortunately,
nothing's foolproof.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.347
All right,
let's run some tests,

09:25.390 --> 09:26.783
see what we're dealing with.

09:26.827 --> 09:29.481
CBC, CMP, blood and sputum
cultures and chest X-ray.

09:29.525 --> 09:30.570
- Got it.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.528
- Hang in there.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.008
- So Tara's pregnant?

09:34.051 --> 09:35.923
-
- You're kidding.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.794
You're gonna be a grandma?
- I know, right?

09:37.838 --> 09:39.491
My baby's gonna be a mother.

09:39.535 --> 09:42.277
- How far along is she?
- 24 weeks.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.408
- How am I just
hearing about this now?

09:43.452 --> 09:45.367
- Well,
Tara just gave me the okay.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.760
I've been dying to tell you.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.065
- So, boy, girl?

09:48.109 --> 09:49.501
- Oh, she doesn't know.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.895
But she's already finished
decorating the nursery,

09:51.939 --> 09:54.202
she's planning
her own baby shower.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.943
Basically, I'm a spectator.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.945
- Well, you know,
she has always been

09:57.988 --> 09:59.337
a take charge kind of gal.

09:59.381 --> 10:00.774
I wonder
where she gets that from.

10:00.817 --> 10:01.731
-
- Yeah.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.211
Congratulations.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.474
Seriously, to both of you.
- Thank you, Daniel.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.128
Thank you.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.174
- Afternoon, Dr. Taylor.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.524
- Hey, Dr. Charles.

10:12.568 --> 10:13.569
- There he is.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.223
He beat the deadline?

10:15.266 --> 10:17.181
- Yeah, we texted
a little while ago.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.661
- So you're
gonna see him again?

10:18.705 --> 10:20.445
- You're dating Dr. Shentu?

10:20.489 --> 10:21.882
- Not dating.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.144
We just hung out.

10:23.187 --> 10:24.841
But I'm not sure
it's gonna go anywhere.

10:24.885 --> 10:27.496
Busy schedules like ours,
I know how that plays out.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.672
Never ends well,
but it is what it is.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.501
- Bright side,
always new faces on the apps.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.679
- Millennial romance.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.246
Complicated world.

10:38.289 --> 10:41.075
All those dating sites,
it's like a tyranny of choice.

10:41.118 --> 10:44.513
- Mm, you have no idea.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.820
- Dr. Taylor.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.648
Your patient, Kiran Patel,

10:48.691 --> 10:50.911
there's nothing neurologically
wrong with her.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.826
- Really?

10:52.869 --> 10:54.566
- Residents.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.612
I reviewed her scan.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.179
Normal CT, normal MRI.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.790
No thoracic
or lumbar abnormalities.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.096
No autoimmune issues.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.706
So yeah, really.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.056
- But she can't move her legs,
doesn't feel any sensation?

11:06.100 --> 11:07.449
- Nevertheless,
it's not mechanical.

11:07.492 --> 11:08.493
I'd go back through her chart,

11:08.537 --> 11:09.799
look for zebras.
- I already did.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.322
There's no medical explanation

11:11.366 --> 11:12.759
to explain her symptoms,
either.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.325
- Well, she doesn't need me

11:14.369 --> 11:16.937
and she doesn't need you...

11:16.980 --> 11:18.678
have at it, Dan.

11:24.031 --> 11:27.164
- This is Jack Baker, he was
in a car crash this morning.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.252
I was able
to take out his spleen

11:28.296 --> 11:29.645
and control the bleeding,

11:29.689 --> 11:32.779
but the post-surgery
head CT was bleak.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.694
Head injuries are extensive.

11:34.737 --> 11:35.738
- CT Angio?

11:35.782 --> 11:37.000
- Mm, no flow.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.046
He's also fixed and dilated.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.830
Neuro's gonna
give him an apnea test

11:40.874 --> 11:42.658
soon as he lands in the ICU,
but I'm pretty certain

11:42.702 --> 11:44.355
it's gonna confirm
he's brain dead.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.662
- You called me,
I assume he's an organ donor?

11:46.706 --> 11:47.707
- Yeah, card carrying.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.839
Make sure he saves
a lot of people.

11:51.319 --> 11:53.103
- Hey.
- There you are.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.191
I texted you.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.019
- Yeah, sorry, I was upstairs.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.194
Peds patient.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.848
- You good?

11:58.892 --> 12:00.067
- Yeah, catch me up.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.546
- Incoming!

12:01.590 --> 12:02.939
- Crockett!
- Yes.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.985
- Hey, come on, I need you
right now at Baghdad.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.726
- Go, trauma comes first.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.031
- Okay.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.424
- This is Jack's wife?

12:09.467 --> 12:11.208
- Yeah, Rose Banks, 31,

12:11.252 --> 12:12.993
passenger, high speed MVC.

12:13.036 --> 12:16.257
GCS 3, BP 130/80,
heart rate 110.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.519
- All right.
- CPR in the field

12:17.562 --> 12:19.260
but got ROSC,
we intubated without drugs.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.696
- All right,
transfer on my count.

12:20.740 --> 12:24.178
One, two, three.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.919
All right, how long
was she down?

12:25.962 --> 12:27.094
- Don't know.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.530
Took the truck company
22 minutes

12:28.573 --> 12:29.661
to clear enough space
to squeeze into the vehicle.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.098
Bagged her as soon
as we reached her.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.229
She came back
with one round of Epi.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.709
- Hey, Rose?

12:33.753 --> 12:34.971
Rose, can you hear me?

12:35.015 --> 12:36.886
No response to painful
and verbal stimuli.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.411
Feeling a step off in her neck.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.239
- No obvious leg fractures.

12:42.283 --> 12:43.284
Let's cut these clothes off.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.112
- Pupils are fixed and dilated.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.331
- No, no, no, no, no, give me
the shears, give me the shears.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.335
Oh, my God, she's pregnant.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.554
All right, ultrasound.

12:56.123 --> 12:59.256
No free fluid.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.171
All right.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.999
Placenta appears intact.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.566
- Based on femur length,

13:04.609 --> 13:07.874
fetus is approximately
32 weeks.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.919
- Volume all the way up.

13:11.007 --> 13:12.879
Hush, shh!

13:12.922 --> 13:15.011
- Fetal heart tones are steady.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.404
143.

13:16.447 --> 13:17.753
- All right, baby's holding.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.146
All right,
let's go back to mom.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.061
Run to CT, I want a panscan.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.976
Let's go.

13:23.019 --> 13:26.370
<i>♪</i>

13:31.854 --> 13:33.464
- So?

13:33.508 --> 13:35.815
- Yeah, Ms. Patel is pretty
resistant to the idea

13:35.858 --> 13:38.165
that her paralysis is in
any way psychological.

13:38.208 --> 13:41.690
Kind of repeatedly downplayed
her condition in general.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.953
You know, I'm gonna leave her
alone and see if

13:43.997 --> 13:45.650
maybe after a little rest,
she opens up.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.217
- Her daughter Varsha's
in the waiting room.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.392
I'll let her know.

13:48.436 --> 13:49.393
Oh, wait, there she is.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.830
Varsha, this is Dr. Charles.

13:50.873 --> 13:54.485
- I'm sorry, I was speaking
with Arjun, my fiancé.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.313
Told him about my mom.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.793
He wants to come visit.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.316
- Sure, that's okay.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.622
- No, you don't understand.

14:00.665 --> 14:03.843
I've never met him before.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.584
This would be the first time.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.673
- You're kidding,
the first time?

14:08.717 --> 14:10.240
- It's an arranged marriage.

14:10.284 --> 14:13.765
It's sweet of him
to want to come, but...

14:13.809 --> 14:17.682
I don't know if it's best
to meet him like this.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.771
I better talk with my mom.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.340
- Wow.

14:23.384 --> 14:24.559
Arranged marriage.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.735
- Yeah, I guess so.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.128
- I mean,
letting your parents decide

14:28.171 --> 14:29.477
who you end up with
for the rest of your life?

14:29.520 --> 14:31.522
That's--wow.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.263
- Well, I mean,
it is a tradition

14:33.307 --> 14:36.440
that's survived
for thousands of years, right?

14:36.484 --> 14:37.833
Across numerous cultures,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.748
so there's gotta be
something to it.

14:39.791 --> 14:43.012
- Yeah, but I mean,
this culture is Chicago, 2022.

14:43.056 --> 14:45.623
I've been on a few blind dates,
and they're terrifying.

14:45.667 --> 14:46.668
And that was just for coffee.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.452
I can't imagine the anxiety

14:48.496 --> 14:49.497
that Varsha's feeling
right now.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.194
- You know what?

14:51.238 --> 14:52.761
I don't know a whole lot
about arranged marriage,

14:52.804 --> 14:54.067
but I'm betting you're right.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.156
It should be Varsha
who's feeling

14:56.199 --> 14:58.288
all the pressure,
all the stress, right?

14:58.332 --> 14:59.855
And yet...

14:59.899 --> 15:01.552
- It's her mother who's
in the hospital bed

15:01.596 --> 15:03.946
with symptoms we can't explain.

15:03.990 --> 15:04.816
- Yeah.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.557
- Your girl did this?

15:06.601 --> 15:08.385
- Stabbed me with scissors.

15:08.429 --> 15:09.952
That's my fault, really.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.215
Things got
a little more passionate

15:12.259 --> 15:14.739
than we had anticipated.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.872
- All right, vitals are stable.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.526
Let's get ready for an X-ray.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.745
Taking you down.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.617
Kathleen.
- Yep.

15:22.660 --> 15:25.098
- Clear.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.579
- Okay, looks good.

15:28.623 --> 15:29.885
Nothing metallic retained.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.669
- Cool, so only a flesh wound?

15:31.713 --> 15:33.671
- Maybe.
Maggie, let's get a DPL kit.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.412
- You got it.

15:35.456 --> 15:36.761
- Just sew me up
and I'll go.

15:36.805 --> 15:37.980
- Yeah, sorry.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.155
We gotta see what we're
working with

15:39.199 --> 15:41.157
before we let you
roll out of here, man.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.768
-
Man, I hate hospitals.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.379
- Better dial down the passion,
then, lover boy.

15:45.422 --> 15:46.815
- Mm.

15:53.300 --> 15:57.086
- Rose's scans revealed
a C-3 on 4 subluxation.

15:57.130 --> 16:00.960
Her spinal injuries
caused her to stop breathing.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.397
And the lack
of oxygen and blood flow

16:03.440 --> 16:06.400
led to a catastrophic stroke.

16:06.443 --> 16:07.792
There's no brain activity.

16:07.836 --> 16:11.274
- So Rose is gone?

16:11.318 --> 16:12.754
- I'm very sorry.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.237
- What--what--what about
the baby?

16:17.280 --> 16:19.804
- Well, there's, uh,

16:19.848 --> 16:21.545
there's no way
to know if the fetus

16:21.589 --> 16:23.765
was injured until it's born.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.681
Right now,
the heart tones are steady.

16:26.724 --> 16:29.771
However,
the situation is fluid.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.120
- So--so what do we do?

16:31.164 --> 16:33.383
- Well, there are two options.

16:33.427 --> 16:37.083
Steroids to help mature
the baby's lungs

16:37.126 --> 16:39.607
followed by
a C-section to deliver.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.130
Or we wait.

16:42.392 --> 16:43.654
- Wh--what's better?

16:43.698 --> 16:44.960
- It's hard to say.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.179
Delivery would put us
out in front

16:46.222 --> 16:48.833
of any
potential future problems.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.749
But at only 32 weeks,
the baby would be facing

16:51.793 --> 16:53.447
the challenges
of a premature birth.

16:53.490 --> 16:56.493
- Yeah, waiting
gives more time in utero.

16:56.537 --> 16:59.061
But Rose's trauma was severe.

16:59.105 --> 17:03.109
So if she decompensates,
so will the baby.

17:03.152 --> 17:06.764
- If we--we deliver,
what happens to Rose?

17:06.808 --> 17:08.462
- Rose is
a registered organ donor.

17:08.505 --> 17:13.162
Her organs would be given
to those patients in need,

17:13.206 --> 17:14.990
and then she would be
taken off life support.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.515
-
David, you decide.

17:22.911 --> 17:24.695
- I--I guess deliver.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.175
That a good decision?

17:26.219 --> 17:27.698
- Yes.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.874
Dr. Archer and I support it.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.963
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.704
We'll give you some privacy
with your daughter.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.013
- Hey, Rudy.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.363
You remember Dr. Cook?

17:40.407 --> 17:42.148
- You just couldn't stay away,
could you?

17:42.191 --> 17:44.063
- Believe me, Dr. Cook,
I tried.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.326
- Who's that little guy?

17:46.369 --> 17:47.457
- My nephew Harley.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.938
Still haven't met him
in person yet.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.288
So what's the damage?

17:52.332 --> 17:53.898
Literally?

17:53.942 --> 17:56.031
- Fungal pneumonia.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.728
- So going to admit me?

17:57.772 --> 17:59.817
- Yes, Dr. Cook will take over.

17:59.861 --> 18:00.862
Short term,
we're gonna start you

18:00.905 --> 18:02.603
on antibiotics
and anti-fungals,

18:02.646 --> 18:05.127
get a CT to help better
define the infection.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.172
- A CT?

18:06.215 --> 18:07.869
You already know
I have pneumonia.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.784
- Yeah, I know, CTs aren't fun.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.742
- That's putting it mildly.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.004
I've had a bunch.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.528
And I'm claustrophobic.

18:14.571 --> 18:17.400
Worst part, the CTs never seem
to show anything new.

18:17.444 --> 18:21.274
- Well, Rudy,
then maybe we can skip it.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.232
There's no red flags
with his labs.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.191
And check out
this chest X-ray from today

18:25.234 --> 18:28.368
compared to the one taken
from the last time I saw him.

18:28.411 --> 18:31.632
- Yeah, lung scarring
is unchanged.

18:31.675 --> 18:34.113
- I think we can get by today
without the CT.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.463
-
- Dr. Halstead?

18:36.506 --> 18:39.466
- Well, if Dr. Cook is okay
with it, I guess I am too.

18:39.509 --> 18:40.641
It was nice meeting you.

18:40.684 --> 18:41.772
Take care.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.948
- You too.
- Thanks.

18:43.992 --> 18:46.647
-
Ms. Patel, how we feeling?

18:46.690 --> 18:49.128
-
You again.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.956
- I understand that, uh,
congratulations are in order.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.262
Your daughter's
getting married.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.960
- Yes, she's actually
talking to her fiancé

18:56.004 --> 18:57.223
on the phone right now.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.746
- Huh.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.922
Look, I just had
a couple more questions.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.184
I promise to be very quick.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.447
- All right.
- Okay.

19:04.491 --> 19:08.277
So I've been looking at
your chart, and apparently,

19:08.321 --> 19:11.976
your legs started to feel
heavy, what, about a month ago?

19:12.020 --> 19:13.326
Now, were there
any other symptoms

19:13.369 --> 19:15.197
that--that you can
describe to me?

19:15.241 --> 19:18.069
Or has it just been the legs?

19:18.113 --> 19:21.725
- A while ago, I noticed that
my foot was tingly.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.597
But it would come and go,
I managed.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.859
- Okay.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.905
And this tingling,
when did that start?

19:27.949 --> 19:30.299
- I'm not sure.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.648
Maybe a year?

19:31.692 --> 19:36.218
- And what was happening
in your life back then?

19:36.262 --> 19:40.091
Any big events jump out at you
that you can remember?

19:40.135 --> 19:41.136
- Not really.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.617
I had cut back on working.

19:43.660 --> 19:47.577
I was volunteering
at the temple's soup kitchen.

19:47.621 --> 19:52.191
I just started reviewing
husband profiles for Varsha.

19:52.234 --> 19:55.846
Reading bios,
comparing astrological charts.

19:55.890 --> 19:58.371
- So choosing Arjun,

19:58.414 --> 20:00.503
that was then pretty much
down to you and your husband.

20:02.418 --> 20:03.985
- He's deceased.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.987
- Oh.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.032
Okay.
- It was...

20:08.076 --> 20:10.774
my decision.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.167
As her mother...

20:14.909 --> 20:16.824
That's what I'm supposed to do.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.217
- Right.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.479
- And that's--
that's a really big decision

20:19.522 --> 20:20.958
for one person to make,
isn't it?

20:23.874 --> 20:25.224
- Ms--Ms. Patel,
are you all right?

20:29.184 --> 20:30.751
They can't get married.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.274
- Okay, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

20:32.318 --> 20:33.536
Breathe with me, all right?

20:33.580 --> 20:35.321
In through the nose.
-

20:35.364 --> 20:37.061

20:37.105 --> 20:38.889

20:38.933 --> 20:40.587

20:40.630 --> 20:41.892
- There you go.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.510
- Fetal heart rate dropping.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.903
- Our baby's in trouble.
Fetal heart rate falling.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.515

21:54.008 --> 21:55.923
I think Rose and Jack
would've liked that name.

21:55.966 --> 22:00.014

do you understand

22:00.057 --> 22:03.539
the explanation
the doctors just gave you?

22:03.583 --> 22:06.237
- Tyler just needs
more time to develop.

22:06.281 --> 22:07.369
- No.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.371
No.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.722
There was a complete
abruption of Rose's placenta.

22:12.766 --> 22:15.421
The baby's blood flow
and oxygen were cut off.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.640
His heart beat was restored.

22:17.684 --> 22:19.381
Neurologically, though...

22:19.425 --> 22:21.035
- But he's on life support.

22:21.078 --> 22:23.864
That will help like
he's still inside Rose.

22:23.907 --> 22:27.955
- I'm sorry, but his condition
is unrecoverable.

22:27.998 --> 22:30.131
He can't survive
off the ventilator.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.394
- But maybe if we wait
just a little longer?

22:32.438 --> 22:33.961
- Why don't we give them

22:38.792 --> 22:41.447
I can't imagine what
they're going through.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.013
Let's give them space for now.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.015
They just lost their daughter
and son-in-law.

22:45.059 --> 22:46.626
They're not yet ready to accept

22:46.669 --> 22:49.933
the loss of their
grandchild as well.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.500
- Yeah.

22:54.590 --> 22:58.202
- Your patient
from earlier, Kayla?

22:58.246 --> 23:00.117
- Been a hard day.

23:08.735 --> 23:10.737
- What's all this?

23:10.780 --> 23:13.043
- Atwater bought a small
apartment building.

23:13.087 --> 23:15.959
So Jay thinks I should
get into real estate too.

23:16.003 --> 23:17.744
He found this place
in Canaryville,

23:17.787 --> 23:18.875
you know, the old neighborhood.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.747
Wants me to check it out
before it sells.

23:20.790 --> 23:23.053
- Well, real estate's hot,
I'll give him that.

23:23.097 --> 23:26.187
And it seems more your speed
than a cannabis club.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.536

Your patient was just admitted.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.585

Hey, gotta go.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.160
So we're good?

23:43.204 --> 23:44.510
Not gonna die, am I?

23:44.553 --> 23:46.337
- You're not gonna die,
but we do need to talk

23:46.381 --> 23:47.556
about your DPL results.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.992
All right, they're scaled,

23:49.036 --> 23:50.820
the magic number being 100,000.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.474
Under 100,000, you can go home.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.607
And over it, you need surgery.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.347
- Okay, so, give it to me.
How'd I do?

23:56.391 --> 23:58.437
- 96,000.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.916
- Where do I sign so I can go?

23:59.960 --> 24:01.875
- Wh--here's the thing.

24:01.918 --> 24:04.486
96,000 is
beneath the threshold,

24:04.530 --> 24:06.227
but I'd feel a lot
more comfortable

24:06.270 --> 24:08.490
if the surgeon took a look
at the wound from the inside.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.013
Do me a favor, all right?

24:10.057 --> 24:12.407
Take a little more time,
think about it.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.757
Yeah? Okay.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.503
- Hey. Everything's okay?

24:21.547 --> 24:23.287
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

24:27.770 --> 24:30.599
Oh. Milena.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.079
10-99, I should've known
it was a cop.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.473
You okay?
Something wrong with the valve?

24:34.516 --> 24:38.259
- No, I'm not here about me.

24:38.302 --> 24:40.261
Your patient, Stefan?

24:40.304 --> 24:42.132
I need him discharged.

24:42.176 --> 24:42.959
- Why?

24:43.003 --> 24:46.310
He undercover with you?

24:46.354 --> 24:48.791
A CI?

24:48.835 --> 24:49.923
Okay, you want me to help you,

24:49.966 --> 24:52.099
but you're gonna leave me
in the dark?

24:52.142 --> 24:54.623
- Working a DTO.
You know the rules.

24:54.667 --> 24:57.104
- Yeah, I got rules too.
Do no harm.

24:57.147 --> 24:58.671
- All right, well,
he got stabbed with scissors.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.368
He's not exactly
dead man walking.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.676
All right.

25:03.719 --> 25:05.939
Stefan's brokering
a meet tonight.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.331
If he's not there,
it doesn't happen,

25:07.375 --> 25:08.855
and my case takes a big hit.

25:08.898 --> 25:10.857
- So because you're jammed up,
you're jamming me up.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.468
- Well, I--
I wish I didn't have to.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.296
Honestly.

25:15.339 --> 25:16.950
- Really?

25:16.993 --> 25:19.343
- But bad guys can't win,
Dylan.

25:27.308 --> 25:29.658
- How's my mom?

25:29.702 --> 25:31.442
- I suspect that's she's
suffering from something

25:31.486 --> 25:33.227
called Conversion Disorder,

25:33.270 --> 25:35.882
which is a mental condition
that occurs when

25:35.925 --> 25:39.320
unresolved or unconscious
mental conflict

25:39.363 --> 25:41.757
manifests itself as
physical symptoms.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.977
- Mental condition?

25:44.020 --> 25:46.370
Her weakness is real.
- It--it's very real.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.938
What I'm saying is,
I don't think it's being caused

25:48.982 --> 25:52.507
by some kind of
underlying neurologic disorder.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.465
- By what, then?

25:54.509 --> 25:56.076
- Very likely stress.

25:56.119 --> 25:59.166
You know, I believe
that your mom is

25:59.209 --> 26:01.255
bottling up emotions so tightly

26:01.298 --> 26:02.691
that it's literally
attacking her.

26:02.735 --> 26:04.345
It's attacking her body.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.476
- Why?

26:05.520 --> 26:07.870
- Varsha, I think that she's

26:07.914 --> 26:10.743
very conflicted about
your upcoming marriage.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.571
- The ceremony's in two weeks.

26:12.614 --> 26:15.574
Family's flying in from India.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.925
Why, all of a sudden,
is she against the marriage?

26:18.968 --> 26:20.404
- I don't know.

26:20.448 --> 26:23.886
But figuring that out is
crucial in treating your mom.

26:27.716 --> 26:29.022
- There you are.

26:29.065 --> 26:30.676
Stefan said that
he's gonna have the surgery,

26:30.719 --> 26:32.765
so I'm gonna call upstairs and
see if there's an OR available.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.767
- Uh, hold up.

26:36.377 --> 26:38.945
- You win, doc.
Just go ahead, cut me open.

26:38.988 --> 26:41.774
- Uh, look, um...

26:41.817 --> 26:44.385
I thought about it,
and you're stable.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.517
You're clearly not in pain,
haven't had any complications,

26:46.561 --> 26:48.650

40:10.495 --> 40:12.192
while I was away,
it was very kind.

40:12.235 --> 40:15.717
- I always wanted you to know
you weren't alone.

40:15.761 --> 40:18.720
And this is Dr. Archer,
he's the chief of our ED.

40:18.764 --> 40:20.940
- Pleasure to meet you,
Dr. Asher.

40:20.983 --> 40:22.158
Please.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.469
- Thank you both.

40:28.513 --> 40:31.646
I'm looking forward to coming
back and for this opportunity.

40:31.690 --> 40:34.606
- Well, I don't mean to be
insensitive, Dr. Asher,

40:34.649 --> 40:37.173
but I do have to ask.

40:37.217 --> 40:40.089
Are you sure Med
is the best place for you?

40:40.133 --> 40:41.613
Given your history.

40:41.656 --> 40:43.049
- You mean my addiction?

40:44.746 --> 40:46.835
It's a fair question.

40:46.879 --> 40:49.098
I am almost two years sober

40:49.142 --> 40:52.841
and committed to doing whatever
it takes to stay that way.

40:52.885 --> 40:55.975
I'm ready for this, both
personally and professionally.

40:59.239 --> 41:01.197
- Welcome back, Dr. Asher.
