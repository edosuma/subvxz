[ Groans ]

09:50.357 --> 09:52.693
Huh. So she really didn't
want us to break that vase.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.098
I really feel like
it's watching us.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.399
[ Pounding on door ]
Aah!

09:59.432 --> 10:00.834
Take it!
Huh.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.469
What with the way you
raised your kids,

10:02.502 --> 10:04.137
I'm amazed they haven't
smashed it by now.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.505
Well, actually,
Mom told us to --

10:05.538 --> 10:07.340
To look after it because
it contains the ashes

10:07.374 --> 10:09.242
of a beloved pet,
and we're sad to see it go,

10:09.276 --> 10:11.111
but if that's how it's gotta be,
then fine!

10:11.144 --> 10:12.980
I thought that might
be the case.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.481
So I've brought you this.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.918
No!

10:17.951 --> 10:19.753
Oh! You shouldn't have.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.122
This one's even nicer.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.623
Personally,
I think it's hideous,

10:23.657 --> 10:25.592
but I know you have very
different taste to me.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.861
That's the one I meant to
give you all along.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.798
Anyway, I better get Roosevelt
back to Louie.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.400
He just can't sleep without
the dried-out remains

10:33.433 --> 10:36.203

You haven't been gone that long,
have you?

10:47.781 --> 10:50.517
So, Mom, what are you gonna do
with the new vase?

Well, sure had
a lot of dust in it.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.628
Yeah. Let's all agree
that was dust.
