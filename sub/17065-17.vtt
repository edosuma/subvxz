WEBVTT

00:04.892 --> 00:06.992
I just did the impossible.

00:07.084 --> 00:08.884
You actually changed
the toilet-paper roll?

00:08.929 --> 00:11.597
No. I taught Anna-Kat
to put herself to bed.

00:11.665 --> 00:13.465
But I like her bedtime ritual.

00:13.534 --> 00:14.733
We tuck her in, untuck her,

00:14.802 --> 00:17.169
tuck her in again, untuck, tuck, untuck.

00:17.238 --> 00:19.505
You know what? I've come around
on this. Great job, Greg.

00:19.573 --> 00:21.974
Think about it... If Anna-Kat
puts herself to bed every night,

00:22.042 --> 00:24.009
that frees up 10 extra hours a week.

00:24.078 --> 00:26.345
I could re-read Proust, but in French.

00:26.414 --> 00:28.945
Why am I so attracted to bad boys?

00:29.927 --> 00:30.849
Ow!

00:30.918 --> 00:32.818
I hit the pointy part!

00:32.887 --> 00:35.587
I told the kids a hundred times
to close the cabinet doors.

00:35.656 --> 00:38.056
Forget the Lamaze breathing.
Just swear, Greg.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.859
Any swear word plus the word
"face" works really well.

00:40.928 --> 00:42.094
You know I don't like to swear.

00:42.163 --> 00:43.762
And that's why the kids
don't listen to you.

00:43.831 --> 00:45.697
Until they bring back hitting,
swearing at them

00:45.766 --> 00:47.466
is the only way we get them
to do what we want.

00:48.536 --> 00:50.369
- Hey, Ottos!
- Hey, Viv!

00:50.438 --> 00:52.004
Just barge right in.

00:52.072 --> 00:54.440
Remind me... what are the
specifics on Stand Your Ground?

00:54.508 --> 00:56.308
Did you bring us gifts?

00:56.377 --> 00:58.277
No, these are my clothes.
But don't worry.

00:58.345 --> 01:00.712
It's all high-end stuff, so it
wouldn't be your style anyway.

01:00.781 --> 01:02.014
Could've stopped at
"These are my clothes."

01:02.082 --> 01:05.083
Can I leave these here for a bit?

01:05.152 --> 01:06.952
Alan gets annoyed when I buy things,

01:07.021 --> 01:08.921
so I hide the clothes until he leaves.

01:08.989 --> 01:11.523
Hmm. Do you always hide
purchases from your husband?

01:11.592 --> 01:12.958
Of course. Doesn't everyone?

01:13.027 --> 01:15.093
No, Viv. Everyone does not.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.941
And why does Alan care
what you buy, anyway?

01:17.034 --> 01:18.081
Aren't you guys rich?

01:18.152 --> 01:19.865
No. Alan and I are wealthy.

01:19.934 --> 01:22.134
Rich people are just
regular people with boats.

01:22.273 --> 01:23.305
I had a dinghy.

01:23.404 --> 01:24.937
Ohh, Greg, don't make this conversation

01:25.005 --> 01:26.271
any stupider than it already is.

01:26.340 --> 01:28.006
But it's not about the money.

01:28.075 --> 01:30.709
Alan just gets cranky when I do
things without his permission.

01:30.778 --> 01:31.710
Permission?

01:31.779 --> 01:33.745
Well, not permission exactly.

01:33.814 --> 01:35.647
It's just, if I want to do something

01:35.716 --> 01:37.749
and he doesn't like it,
he doesn't let me do it.

01:37.818 --> 01:38.884
That's permission!

01:38.953 --> 01:41.019
Viv, that is not how a marriage works.

01:41.088 --> 01:42.854
A marriage is supposed to be 50/50.

01:42.923 --> 01:44.222
I'd kill for 50/50.

01:44.291 --> 01:45.624
70/30 sounds nice.

01:45.693 --> 01:46.959
I hear you,

01:47.027 --> 01:48.994
but things would be easier
if Alan didn't see these,

01:49.063 --> 01:50.329
so can you hide them for me?

01:51.031 --> 01:52.364
Okay. Fine.

01:52.433 --> 01:53.532
Thank you!

01:53.601 --> 01:55.367
But I get to keep
what's ever in this bag.

01:58.706 --> 02:01.239
I'm just picturing you
putting on my leather pants.

02:02.509 --> 02:03.742
Bye!

02:07.147 --> 02:08.380
Please don't.

02:08.449 --> 02:09.314
Don't what?

02:09.383 --> 02:10.382
Get involved.

02:10.451 --> 02:12.284
Just stay out of Viv's marriage.

02:12.353 --> 02:13.986
But Viv's husband is awful.

02:14.054 --> 02:15.387
We've never even met the guy!

02:15.456 --> 02:17.689
Remember when you both were
pulling out of the driveway?

02:17.758 --> 02:19.992
You waved at him,
and he didn't wave back.

02:20.060 --> 02:22.160
He never waves at me,
but I'm not a waver.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.362
You're a waver, Greg.

02:23.430 --> 02:25.230
Look, Alan may not be great,
but getting involved

02:25.299 --> 02:27.766
in other people's marriages
is never a good idea.

02:27.835 --> 02:29.868
Wrong. It's always a good idea.

02:29.937 --> 02:31.136
See how I disregarded what you said?

02:31.205 --> 02:32.537
Viv should do that.

02:32.606 --> 02:35.340
I don't just give advice.
I practice what I preach.

02:35.409 --> 02:36.708
Screw her.

02:36.777 --> 02:38.343
I'm gonna get these pants on.

02:38.412 --> 02:41.279

02:45.486 --> 02:46.985
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh!

02:47.054 --> 02:49.287
Aren't you two forgetting something?

02:49.356 --> 02:50.522
Happy birthday?

02:51.825 --> 02:53.225
I don't know. I took a shot.

02:53.293 --> 02:57.996
Here's a little thing I call
"closing the kitchen cabinets."

02:58.065 --> 02:59.031
Sorry, Dad.

02:59.099 --> 03:01.266
We'll do it next time.

03:01.335 --> 03:02.868
Did you see that?

03:02.936 --> 03:04.369
Ring, ring! Hello?

03:04.438 --> 03:05.604
Parenting magazine?

03:05.673 --> 03:08.874
Why, yes, I'd love to write
an advice column.

03:08.942 --> 03:10.909
You closed the cabinets for them.

03:10.978 --> 03:13.278
If you want them to listen,
you got to swear at them.

03:13.347 --> 03:14.880
And if you want to slap them
around a little bit,

03:14.948 --> 03:17.349
I think that's a... wink...
bad... wink, wink... idea.

03:17.418 --> 03:18.984
Hola, Ottos!

03:19.053 --> 03:21.386
Thanks so much for
stashing those clothes for me.

03:21.455 --> 03:22.988
Viv, I was thinking about it,

03:23.057 --> 03:24.356
- I'll get your bags.
- and...

03:24.425 --> 03:26.658
Why don't you just go outside?

03:26.727 --> 03:27.893
Katie, you stay here,

03:27.961 --> 03:30.195
and we'll all stay involved
in our own lives.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.333
Viv, come sit down.

03:37.204 --> 03:39.438
You shouldn't have to hide
your new clothes

03:39.506 --> 03:40.939
from your husband
at your neighbor's house.

03:41.008 --> 03:42.541
Why not? This way, everyone's happy.

03:42.609 --> 03:43.608
You're not happy.

03:43.677 --> 03:45.143
- I'm not?
- No.

03:45.212 --> 03:47.546
You need to tell your husband
to stop being so controlling.

03:47.614 --> 03:49.448
I'm just not great
at that sort of a thing.

03:49.516 --> 03:51.683
Well, then, let's practice.
Let's do a little role-play.

03:51.752 --> 03:53.518
- Oh.
- Okay, you be Alan, and I'll be you.

03:53.587 --> 03:54.853
Okay.

03:54.922 --> 03:56.421
This is gonna be so much fun!

03:56.490 --> 03:57.489
You ready?

03:57.558 --> 04:00.559
That is so how I talk!
How are you so good at impressions?

04:00.627 --> 04:02.894
Well, it's very easy, because
you only have two voices...

04:02.963 --> 04:04.763
higher and higher!

04:04.832 --> 04:07.065
You're just as fun and cheerful as I am!

04:07.134 --> 04:09.034
Hey, Viv, what do you think
of my new outfit?

04:09.103 --> 04:10.569
I love it!

04:10.637 --> 04:13.505
Hey, Viv, what do you like most
about yourself...

04:13.574 --> 04:15.574
your hair or your smile?

04:15.642 --> 04:17.676
I've really put you
in an impossible position.

04:17.745 --> 04:19.111
Okay, stop it.
You're supposed to be Alan.

04:19.178 --> 04:20.312
This is clearly not working.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.913
Ugh. You're you again.

04:21.982 --> 04:24.583
How about this time,
you be you and I'll be Alan?

04:24.651 --> 04:25.717
Okay.

04:26.854 --> 04:29.054
- Vivian.
- Ooh!

04:29.123 --> 04:30.989
The flannel shirt and that deep voice...

04:31.058 --> 04:32.424
You're like a lumberjack.

04:32.493 --> 04:35.026
Why did you purchase
a sweater with no sleeves?

04:35.095 --> 04:36.461
Because my arms look amazing.

04:36.530 --> 04:38.530
- And it cost...?
- $2,000.

04:38.599 --> 04:40.031
$2,000?!

04:40.100 --> 04:43.535
Do you know how many people I could
take to Buca di Beppo with $2,000?

04:43.604 --> 04:45.470
Wait. Are you saying that
as Alan or as you?

04:45.539 --> 04:46.972
'Cause he's never been to Buca di Beppo.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.007
Both. But that's not the point.

04:49.076 --> 04:51.676
The point is,
you do not need to be nervous

04:51.745 --> 04:53.078
around your own husband.

04:53.147 --> 04:54.813
$2,000!

04:54.882 --> 04:56.448
I'm getting off track.

04:56.517 --> 04:58.917
Don't hide things from Alan
because you think he'll get mad.

04:58.986 --> 05:01.486
Get mad at him
for making you hide things!

05:01.555 --> 05:04.084
You're absolutely right.
Alan is not the boss of me.

05:04.146 --> 05:05.657
- Mnh-mnh.
- And I'm gonna tell him that

05:05.726 --> 05:08.059
the second he gets back from the city!

05:10.497 --> 05:12.697
Aw, man.

05:12.766 --> 05:15.367
FYI... I did not fit into those pants.

05:15.435 --> 05:18.436
I thought they might be
stretchy, but they were not.

05:22.910 --> 05:24.176
Here you go.

05:26.814 --> 05:27.746
Ugh!

05:29.483 --> 05:30.682
What's Daddy doing?

05:30.751 --> 05:32.150
Passive-aggressively reminding me

05:32.219 --> 05:33.718
that he went to childbirth classes

05:33.787 --> 05:34.920
while I stayed home

05:34.988 --> 05:36.788
and watched the finale
of "Joe Millionaire."

05:36.857 --> 05:39.925
That's it. Taylor, Oliver,
I am taking away your allowance.

05:39.993 --> 05:41.359
Eh, it's only 10 bucks a week.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.528
Plus, you always forget
to give it to us anyway,

05:43.597 --> 05:44.729
so, yeah... eh.

05:48.836 --> 05:51.236
Way to discipline, Greg.

05:51.305 --> 05:54.052
What are you gonna take away
next... the chores, homework?

05:54.123 --> 05:55.443
Viv: Knock, knock, Ottos!

05:55.505 --> 05:57.375
Saying "Knock, knock" when you're
in the house defeats the purpose.

05:57.444 --> 06:00.078
It's like saying "Heads up"
after you've thrown something.

06:00.147 --> 06:01.079
Oh!

06:01.148 --> 06:02.113
Heads up!

06:02.182 --> 06:03.215
So fun!

06:03.283 --> 06:05.884
Hey, Katie, I wanted
to tell you something.

06:05.953 --> 06:07.052
I confronted Alan.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.154
I followed your advice
and told him everything!

06:09.223 --> 06:10.388
Good for you.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.990
After I'm done with this mom thing,

06:12.059 --> 06:13.592
I'm gonna be a marriage counselor.

06:13.660 --> 06:15.126
He didn't like it, so I left him.

06:15.195 --> 06:16.261
- You what?
- Right?

06:16.330 --> 06:17.896
So I'm gonna need
to stay here for a while.

06:17.965 --> 06:19.364
Greg, bring in my bags.

06:21.435 --> 06:22.932
You love me.

06:28.861 --> 06:31.395
Ooh! Greg, you're sweating
all over my stuff.

06:32.531 --> 06:35.665
Sorry... I'll try to curb my body's
natural response to lifting things.

06:35.734 --> 06:36.867
Love it.

06:36.935 --> 06:38.769
You just had to get involved.

06:38.837 --> 06:40.971
Don't get mad at me! It's not my fault!

06:41.039 --> 06:42.506
Katie, thank you so much

06:42.574 --> 06:44.408
for telling me to leave my husband.

06:45.844 --> 06:47.511
I never said "leave."

06:47.579 --> 06:49.112
You never said "don't leave."

06:49.225 --> 06:51.081
Okay. Guys, no kombucha.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.883
Is this where you keep the food
for your workmen?

06:54.720 --> 06:56.887
I can't see you glaring at me.

06:56.955 --> 06:58.388
Just out of curiosity,

06:58.457 --> 07:00.657
is there anyone else
you could stay with?

07:00.726 --> 07:03.126
Let's see... I'm an only child.

07:03.195 --> 07:05.228
My mother is dead, my father is dead.

07:05.297 --> 07:07.397
My best friend was in
a parasailing accident.

07:07.466 --> 07:08.632
I pulled the plug.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.367
Now I'm in a legal battle
with her family.

07:10.435 --> 07:13.136
So, what I'm hearing is that
there's an empty bed somewhere.

07:13.205 --> 07:14.304
How about a hotel?

07:14.373 --> 07:16.239
After I left,
Alan froze my credit cards.

07:16.308 --> 07:17.474
Now the only money I have

07:17.534 --> 07:19.349
are these gift cards
I swiped from my stepsons.

07:19.478 --> 07:21.878
And none of them are for Hilton
or La Quinta Inn?

07:21.947 --> 07:23.213
Nope.

07:23.282 --> 07:25.048
You guys are my only option.

07:25.117 --> 07:28.051
But don't worry...
I know what you're thinking.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.520
Living here is not beneath me.

07:30.589 --> 07:32.556
Okay, it is, but I'm a trouper.

07:32.624 --> 07:34.324
You can stay in Anna-Kat's room.

07:35.928 --> 07:38.361
Hey, Greg, careful when you carry it up.

07:38.430 --> 07:41.107
I can't have your walls
damaging my luggage.

07:46.171 --> 07:47.671
Where's Anna-Kat supposed to sleep?

07:47.739 --> 07:48.972
With us.

07:49.041 --> 07:51.741
It took six years to get
Anna-Kat to sleep on her own.

07:51.810 --> 07:53.977
I'm sorry, but we cannot
send Viv back to Alan.

07:54.046 --> 07:55.312
He's a monster.

07:55.380 --> 07:56.780
All she did was stand up for herself.

07:56.849 --> 08:00.517
It's a marriage, and that means
that they're equal partners.

08:00.586 --> 08:02.536
What is this "equal partners"
you keep mentioning?

08:02.615 --> 08:03.787
And when does that kick in?

08:03.856 --> 08:07.157
Was there a form that I missed?
A box I was supposed to check?

08:07.226 --> 08:09.759
I promise you, he is gonna
miss her, march over here,

08:09.828 --> 08:12.496
knock on our door,
and beg for her to come back.

08:12.564 --> 08:14.731
But this time,
it's gonna be on her terms.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.000
But if you want to kick her out,
then... fine.

08:17.069 --> 08:19.069
I don't want to kick her out.
She killed her best friend.

08:24.810 --> 08:26.409
Anna-Kat, how was your day?

08:26.478 --> 08:28.211
Something really bad happened to me.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.579
I was on the playground...

08:29.648 --> 08:30.914
Ugh. I can beat that.

08:30.983 --> 08:32.315
You know what's really bad?

08:32.384 --> 08:36.086
Since my marriage unraveled,
I don't have any possessions...

08:36.154 --> 08:38.554
which is almost as bad
as having these possessions.

08:38.624 --> 08:41.124
Greg, can you go fetch me
my magazine over there?

08:41.193 --> 08:42.424
Sure.

08:42.494 --> 08:45.328
I think I'm gonna let you guys
talk amongst yourselves

08:45.397 --> 08:46.630
for the rest of dinner.

08:46.698 --> 08:47.597
Aah!

08:49.001 --> 08:50.600
Make it a girl, Daddy!

08:50.669 --> 08:52.102
I want a little sister.

08:52.170 --> 08:55.372
Guys, you have seriously got to
start closing these doors.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.141
Dad, that's true, but at the same time,

08:58.210 --> 09:00.277
you could also watch
where you're walking.

09:00.345 --> 09:01.778
That's just good advice.

09:01.847 --> 09:04.247
Taylor, Oliver, I hate to do
this, but no dessert tonight.

09:04.316 --> 09:06.216
Eh, I'm off sugar anyway.

09:06.285 --> 09:07.717
And since dessert's rice pudding,

09:07.786 --> 09:10.387
seems like I just
dodged a bullet, so... eh.

09:10.455 --> 09:13.924
Um, Greg, I think
I have something to offer

09:13.992 --> 09:16.326
that could really help the situation.

09:16.395 --> 09:17.761
Who wants an Xbox?!

09:17.829 --> 09:18.695
- I do!
- Me!

09:18.764 --> 09:21.064
- Viv's the best!
- Viv, you can't do that.

09:21.133 --> 09:22.399
You're a man!

09:22.467 --> 09:25.101
And because of your wife,
I don't listen to men anymore!

09:26.772 --> 09:29.973
I think what Greg is trying to say is,

09:30.042 --> 09:31.841
you can't spoil the kids

09:31.910 --> 09:33.977
at the exact moment
that he's trying to punish them.

09:34.046 --> 09:36.446
Please! Let me be fun Aunt Viv!

09:36.515 --> 09:38.148
Don't take the kids away from me.

09:38.216 --> 09:39.849
They're all I have left.

09:39.918 --> 09:41.384
You know what? It's all right.

09:41.453 --> 09:42.586
Let them keep it.

09:42.654 --> 09:44.087
Greg, can you try to be mean?

09:44.156 --> 09:46.523
Act like you're at the Dockers store
and they're out of braided belts.

09:50.228 --> 09:52.395
Her part's not straight.
Is that a choice?

10:00.806 --> 10:02.172
Good morning.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.440
I beg to differ.

10:03.508 --> 10:05.875
Anna-Kat has the wingspan of a condor.

10:05.944 --> 10:07.577
I haven't slept for five days.

10:07.646 --> 10:09.646
And Viv's Starbucks order
is out of control...

10:09.715 --> 10:12.949
venti iced skinny hazelnut
macchiato, sugar-free syrup,

10:13.018 --> 10:15.285
extra shot, light ice, no whip.

10:15.354 --> 10:16.353
I know that.

10:17.456 --> 10:18.588
Just hang in there.

10:18.657 --> 10:20.090
"Hang in there"
is what you say to people

10:20.158 --> 10:22.325
when you know
there's an end to something.

10:22.394 --> 10:24.594
Alan isn't coming to take her back.

10:24.663 --> 10:25.962
I know.

10:26.031 --> 10:27.664
There's no begging, no marching...

10:27.733 --> 10:28.832
no nothing.

10:28.900 --> 10:29.866
Only Viv.

10:29.935 --> 10:32.068
Is it possible that this is just it...

10:32.137 --> 10:33.937
that this is the end of Viv's marriage?

10:35.140 --> 10:37.273
I wonder where I would go
if you drove me away.

10:37.342 --> 10:38.808
I have no idea.

10:38.877 --> 10:41.444
I'd hit the Red Roof Inn first.
I know they give a AAA discount.

10:41.513 --> 10:42.879
Then I'd stay in university housing

10:42.948 --> 10:44.280
and see the kids at night.

10:44.349 --> 10:46.616
We'd trade custody
on the weekends, of course.

10:46.685 --> 10:50.253
I'd wait six-ish months before
I went on eHarmony or Bumble,

10:50.322 --> 10:51.454
but I wouldn't introduce her to the kids

10:51.523 --> 10:52.689
until I knew things were serious.

10:52.758 --> 10:54.658
That is not an
off-the-top-of-your-head answer.

10:54.726 --> 10:56.192
Greg!

10:56.261 --> 10:58.161
Did you find that distilled water?

10:58.230 --> 11:00.230
You know that my humidifier's empty!

11:00.298 --> 11:02.065
Why doesn't she ever call you?

11:04.703 --> 11:06.202
Just so you know...
if you ever leave me,

11:06.271 --> 11:07.437
you're the one who's taking the kids

11:07.506 --> 11:09.472
and I'm the one who's
seeing them on the weekends.

11:17.149 --> 11:19.449
I cannot believe Viv is
still living at your house.

11:19.518 --> 11:22.052
Her credit cards are frozen.
She's got nowhere else to go.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.586
Ohh. That's got to be awful.

11:23.655 --> 11:26.690
Or do you... love it?!

11:26.758 --> 11:29.059
I don't love it, but Greg is
taking the brunt of it.

11:29.127 --> 11:30.160
He's a saint.

11:30.228 --> 11:31.261
Oh, he's the best.

11:31.329 --> 11:33.396
Hey, is the hair on his chest patchy?

11:33.465 --> 11:35.131
When I picture it, it's patchy.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.033
Could you please stop
picturing Greg topless?

11:37.102 --> 11:39.717
Fine. I'll put a shirt on him,
but his pants are coming off.

11:40.693 --> 11:42.672
So, Viv and Alan are really
getting divorced, huh?

11:42.741 --> 11:43.973
Isn't that crazy?

11:44.042 --> 11:46.042
It is weird that she's the one who left.

11:46.111 --> 11:47.343
Viv should be at home,

11:47.412 --> 11:49.279
and Alan should be holed up
at the Four Seasons.

11:49.347 --> 11:52.048
Or the Red Roof Inn.
That's where Greg would go.

11:52.117 --> 11:53.283
That is so sad.

11:53.351 --> 11:54.551
Remind me when Greg leaves you

11:54.619 --> 11:56.019
to give him some of my hotel points.

11:56.088 --> 11:57.754
Yeah, but Greg would
never leave. He's too nice.

11:57.823 --> 11:59.155
- Mm-hmm.
- Eh, I'm not so sure.

11:59.224 --> 12:00.724
Remember Mark and Susan Thompson?

12:00.792 --> 12:02.659
Those idiots
who are always talking about

12:02.728 --> 12:04.461
how much they love each other
on Facebook?

12:04.529 --> 12:06.196
Yeah. He left her.

12:06.264 --> 12:07.564
- No!
- No!

12:07.632 --> 12:09.099
Just like that? Out of the blue?

12:09.167 --> 12:12.302
For her, it was out of the blue,
but he had been planning it.

12:12.370 --> 12:13.503
Coldhearted.

12:13.572 --> 12:14.804
But he was so nice.

12:14.873 --> 12:15.939
What went wrong?

12:16.007 --> 12:17.907
Who knows? Maybe he got tired of her.

12:17.976 --> 12:19.242
She's kind of a pain in the ass.

12:20.579 --> 12:21.811
I'm a pain in the ass.

12:23.248 --> 12:24.408
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

12:24.433 --> 12:26.950
If I were you, I'd figure out a way
to get Viv out of your house.

12:27.018 --> 12:29.085
Greg isn't Mark Thompson.
He would never pull the trigger.

12:29.154 --> 12:30.887
He can't even stand up to his own kids.

12:30.956 --> 12:32.455
I'm sure you're right...

12:32.524 --> 12:33.890
Susan.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:42.601 --> 12:44.167
Oh! Look!

12:44.236 --> 12:46.169
Now your horses came to visit.

12:46.238 --> 12:47.437
No.

12:47.506 --> 12:49.305
Anna-Kat, why don't you
tell Mommy what you told me?

12:49.374 --> 12:50.507
I moved them in here

12:50.575 --> 12:52.776
because I'll be sleeping
in your bed forever.

12:52.844 --> 12:53.763
Oh.

12:53.788 --> 12:55.912
Tell her why. Don't leave that part out.

12:55.981 --> 12:58.848
Viv said there's nothing sadder
than sleeping alone.

13:00.352 --> 13:01.918
I'm gonna go get my stuffed lion.

13:01.987 --> 13:03.086
He roars again.

13:03.155 --> 13:04.287
You were wrong.

13:04.356 --> 13:07.223
They didn't stop making AA batteries.

13:07.292 --> 13:08.691
Yay!

13:11.863 --> 13:14.130
Before you say anything,
I'm gonna get Viv out.

13:14.199 --> 13:16.132
Where? Where is she gonna go?

13:16.201 --> 13:17.200
Home?

13:17.269 --> 13:19.202
Send her back to Alan, that monster?

13:19.271 --> 13:21.932
- Well, maybe.
- Yes...?

13:22.020 --> 13:23.840
Maybe we have it all wrong with Alan.

13:23.909 --> 13:25.284
Okay.

13:25.346 --> 13:29.279
Maybe Viv is the monster
and Alan is the victim.

13:29.347 --> 13:31.681
I don't know, Katie.
That's kind of a stretch.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.950
Greg! Where's my turn-down service?!

13:34.019 --> 13:36.419
Never mind. Sold. Alan's the best!

13:47.418 --> 13:49.839
Ooh! They sent two masseuses.

13:49.925 --> 13:51.054
This is great!

13:51.123 --> 13:53.590
You take my legs,
you take from the ass up.

13:53.659 --> 13:56.059
- She seems stronger.
- Uh, no.

13:56.128 --> 13:58.883
We're Katie and Greg Otto.
We live across the street.

13:58.969 --> 14:00.335
Sometimes I wave to you,

14:00.403 --> 14:02.303
but you don't wave back
because of your tennis elbow?

14:02.372 --> 14:03.471
I don't play tennis.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.206
I make money
and I travel around the world.

14:05.275 --> 14:07.976
You see this table right here?
Guess where that table's from.

14:09.212 --> 14:10.578
Ethan Allen?

14:10.647 --> 14:12.680
Tibet. It's from Tibet.

14:12.749 --> 14:14.682
It was in a monastery in a shrine room,

14:14.751 --> 14:16.251
untouched for 1,000 years.

14:16.319 --> 14:19.220
I had a helicopter take it out of
the country in the dead of night.

14:19.289 --> 14:21.589
- That sounds like... a crime.
- Mm-hmm.

14:21.658 --> 14:23.124
Oh, it's a crime. Yeah.

14:23.193 --> 14:26.060
But the great thing about monks
is, they keep their mouths shut.

14:26.229 --> 14:29.464
We've got something that we want
to talk to you about.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.468
Okay. 45 seconds, you can just... sure.

14:33.536 --> 14:34.235
Great.

14:36.306 --> 14:38.072
- Alan's the best.
- The best.

14:40.810 --> 14:42.910
What's your deal?
Are you a dragon slayer?

14:42.979 --> 14:43.811
Uh, a what?

14:43.880 --> 14:44.979
Dragon slayer!

14:45.048 --> 14:46.681
Are you the kind of guy,
you see what you want,

14:46.750 --> 14:47.782
you just go out and you get it?

14:48.952 --> 14:50.718
I bought this sweater off a mannequin.

14:50.787 --> 14:52.687
Oh, okay. It's a start.

14:52.756 --> 14:54.222
You see this ancient horn?

14:54.290 --> 14:56.691
It's from an African tribe in Borneo.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.426
They worshipped that horn.
It was their god.

14:58.495 --> 14:59.560
I took it.

14:59.629 --> 15:01.329
Borneo is actually in Southeast Asia.

15:01.398 --> 15:03.231
- I don't think so.
- It is.

15:03.299 --> 15:04.499
- Whatever.
- Okay.

15:04.567 --> 15:07.402
I took their horn.
I took their god. I own it.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.737
You know what I do with it now?
I keep grapes in it.

15:09.806 --> 15:11.606
I don't even really like grapes.

15:11.674 --> 15:13.474
This was somebody's god!

15:13.543 --> 15:14.809
Whew!

15:14.878 --> 15:16.577
Slaying the dragon.

15:16.646 --> 15:18.312
- He's the best.
- The best.

15:18.381 --> 15:21.751
So, Alan, we've come
to talk to you about Viv.

15:21.816 --> 15:25.518
She's been living with us
during this... difficult time.

15:25.688 --> 15:27.188
- Oh. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

15:27.257 --> 15:28.956
That's where she's been this whole time?

15:29.025 --> 15:29.924
Yeah.

15:29.993 --> 15:31.946
- Huh.
- I'm sure a little communication

15:32.048 --> 15:33.995
can fix whatever problems
you two are going through.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.496
I don't really think there's a problem.

15:35.565 --> 15:38.232
See, ancient horn... one of a kind.

15:38.301 --> 15:40.134
Skinny blonde, likes to shop a lot...

15:40.203 --> 15:41.269
not extinct.

15:41.337 --> 15:43.604
Hey, she's a person, not an object.

15:43.673 --> 15:44.906
Ehh...

15:44.974 --> 15:47.542
Oh, you're the friend
that told her to stand up to me.

15:47.610 --> 15:48.676
Yeah. I did.

15:48.745 --> 15:50.778
And your fragile ego couldn't take it,

15:50.847 --> 15:53.514
so you punished her
by freezing her credit cards.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.049
I didn't freeze her credit cards.

15:55.118 --> 15:56.284
- You didn't?
- No.

15:56.352 --> 15:58.319
Why... I'm bored.

15:58.388 --> 16:00.655
Look, your 45 seconds are up.

16:00.723 --> 16:02.390
The two of you... get out.

16:02.459 --> 16:05.092
All right, fine. We're gonna go.
But you need to know something...

16:05.161 --> 16:06.894
You don't deserve Viv.

16:06.963 --> 16:08.529
Sure, she's awful,

16:08.598 --> 16:14.569
but you are the biggest
piece of [bleeeeeeeeep]

16:14.637 --> 16:16.604
thing I've ever met in my life!

16:16.673 --> 16:18.072
You sound like those monks.

16:22.912 --> 16:24.479
I told you not to get involved.

16:24.547 --> 16:26.147
Sorry, Greg.

16:26.216 --> 16:28.916
I can't believe Viv lied to us
about the credit cards.

16:28.985 --> 16:32.153
And I can't believe
the cabinets are open.

16:32.222 --> 16:34.255
Hey, you guys having fun over here

16:34.324 --> 16:36.090
with the super-awesome thing you love

16:36.159 --> 16:38.125
that you'd really hate to lose?

16:38.194 --> 16:39.026
Dad!

16:39.095 --> 16:40.461
What's going on?!

16:40.530 --> 16:42.396
Now I'll never know
what that prostitute was saying!

16:42.465 --> 16:45.466
You should've listened to me
about the cabinets.

16:45.535 --> 16:46.934
That's why you let us keep it...

16:47.003 --> 16:49.604
so we'd finally have something
good that he could take away.

16:49.672 --> 16:51.906
Wow, Dad, you are coldhearted.

16:51.975 --> 16:54.175
Didn't know you had it in you.

16:54.244 --> 16:57.845
Close the cabinets, go upstairs,
and do your homework.

16:57.914 --> 16:59.247
Oh, and now you two

16:59.315 --> 17:01.382
are in charge
of putting Anna-Kat to bed.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.752
So, you had a plan all along?

17:05.821 --> 17:07.021
Don't let the nice fool you.

17:08.958 --> 17:10.023
Mark Thompson.

17:14.329 --> 17:15.496
Please don't leave me.

17:15.565 --> 17:17.198
What?! Why would I leave you?

17:17.267 --> 17:19.200
Because I'm a pain in the ass.

17:19.269 --> 17:20.434
Why wouldn't you leave me?

17:20.502 --> 17:22.236
I would never leave you.
You're my best friend.

17:22.305 --> 17:23.738
That gives me very little comfort.

17:23.806 --> 17:25.006
You have no friends.

17:25.074 --> 17:28.108
See? I stay stuff like that
all the time.

17:28.176 --> 17:29.443
Why are you thinking about this now?

17:29.512 --> 17:31.412
'Cause everybody's
getting divorced, Greg.

17:31.481 --> 17:33.848
Viv's getting divorced.
The Thompsons are getting divorced.

17:33.917 --> 17:36.417
And you had a secret plan
to take away the kids' Xbox

17:36.486 --> 17:37.485
and destroy their spirits.

17:37.554 --> 17:38.853
They never saw it coming.

17:38.922 --> 17:41.088
Promise me you're not gonna
take your AAA card

17:41.157 --> 17:42.623
and move on with your life.

17:42.692 --> 17:44.058
Because you can Bumble away,

17:44.127 --> 17:47.261
but there is nobody else
out there for me.

17:47.330 --> 17:48.529
Just you.

17:51.834 --> 17:54.302
- I will never leave you.
- Good.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.685
- Unless...
- Unless what?

17:59.747 --> 18:02.209
Unless you can't get
that skinny macchiato

18:02.278 --> 18:03.277
out of our daughter's bedroom.

18:03.346 --> 18:04.645
She's gone.

18:05.982 --> 18:07.648
I'm really glad
you're never divorcing me.

18:07.717 --> 18:09.183
I can't be single again.

18:09.252 --> 18:11.185
I really don't want
to have to lose 30 pounds.

18:18.261 --> 18:19.093
Hi.

18:19.162 --> 18:20.995
Namaste, Katie.

18:21.064 --> 18:22.964
Viv, Greg and I talked to Alan.

18:23.032 --> 18:23.965
Oh!

18:24.033 --> 18:25.600
You lied to us about the credit cards

18:25.668 --> 18:26.901
and used it as an excuse

18:26.970 --> 18:29.136
to crash in our daughter's bedroom...

18:29.205 --> 18:31.339
which you completely redecorated.

18:31.407 --> 18:32.440
But it is better.

18:33.643 --> 18:35.109
Is this the chair from our room?

18:35.178 --> 18:36.611
Yes... with new fabric.

18:40.149 --> 18:41.816
So, what's going on, Viv?

18:44.988 --> 18:48.689
I lied because I didn't want
to stay in a hotel.

18:48.758 --> 18:51.092
They're so lonely and cold.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.627
I wanted to stay in this house

18:52.695 --> 18:55.997
because you and your family
are so warm and...

18:56.065 --> 18:57.965
kind and real.

18:58.034 --> 19:00.201
That is so sweet.

19:00.269 --> 19:03.738
I mean, you do not care what
anyone else thinks about you,

19:03.806 --> 19:05.573
even though there's a lot to critique.

19:05.642 --> 19:09.110
And I guess,
with my own marriage ending,

19:09.178 --> 19:11.312
I just wanted to be near a good one,

19:11.381 --> 19:13.314
even if it was just for a few days.

19:16.119 --> 19:17.918
You got to divorce Alan

19:17.987 --> 19:20.755
and find somebody who's right for you...

19:20.823 --> 19:23.891
somebody who doesn't mind
that you're a pain in the ass.

19:25.928 --> 19:27.261
Like Greg is with me.

19:30.233 --> 19:34.068
- Oh, my gosh! You're... You're so soft!
- Okay.

19:34.137 --> 19:35.269
You know what it's like?

19:35.338 --> 19:37.371
It's like hugging
a little beanbag chair.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.839
Oh, poor, sweet Alan.

19:38.908 --> 19:40.408
Oh, it's so good.

19:46.775 --> 19:48.375
Taylor and Oliver put Anna-Kat to bed,

19:48.443 --> 19:50.443
so we are officially off the clock.

19:50.512 --> 19:51.611
What movie do you want to watch?

19:51.680 --> 19:53.079
I don't know. Let's see.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.281
A documentary could be good.

19:54.349 --> 19:55.782
Ugh. I don't want to learn things, Greg.

19:55.851 --> 19:57.217
How about a superhero movie?

19:57.286 --> 19:59.152
You have the cinematic tastes
of an 11-year-old boy.

19:59.221 --> 20:01.688
- But I think that...
- No, no.

20:01.757 --> 20:03.790
We're 60/40 now,
and this is part of my 40.

20:03.859 --> 20:05.325
Fine.

20:05.394 --> 20:07.827
I am not loving this
almost-equal-partnership thing.

20:07.896 --> 20:09.763
Oh, wait, look.
"Arrival" is on New Releases.

20:09.831 --> 20:10.997
I've heard good things.

20:11.066 --> 20:12.065
Really?

20:12.134 --> 20:14.267
I've heard bad things.

20:14.336 --> 20:15.535
You already watched it, didn't you?

20:15.604 --> 20:17.270
I did, and it was great.

20:19.141 --> 20:20.507
There are no good movies on.

20:20.575 --> 20:21.541
Mnh-mnh.

20:21.610 --> 20:22.876
You want to watch TV instead?

20:22.945 --> 20:25.512
That's a good idea. TV is
just better entertainment.

20:25.580 --> 20:26.813
It really is.
