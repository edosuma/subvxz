EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

00:37.871 --> 00:38.872
Mom?

00:41.958 --> 00:43.251
Could you please take a look at her?

00:47.130 --> 00:48.131
Are you awake?

00:48.840 --> 00:49.966
Let me take your temperature.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.013
I'm fine.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.890
My fever is gone. I feel fine now.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.516
You still have a high fever.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.144
Oh my. Let's run some blood tests.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.520
-Yes, Doctor.
-No.

01:03.605 --> 01:04.606
I'm fine.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.566
I'm better now.

01:06.649 --> 01:07.776
Eun-seong, let's go home.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.194
-Wait.
-Hye-su.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.278
-You can't go.
-Wait.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.738
Hold on. Hye-su.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.366
What's wrong with you?

01:15.617 --> 01:17.035
You're not better at all. Go back.

01:17.118 --> 01:18.119
No.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.454
I'm fine, really.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.791
I'm not sick enough to be in the ER.
It's just a cold.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.626
You were unconscious.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.960
You still have a fever.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.504
No.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.713
Get treated and tested--

01:28.797 --> 01:30.799
No. I'm fine.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.091
I'm not sick.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.218
Let's go.

01:34.803 --> 01:35.804
Hye-su.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.348
-Hye-su.
-I said I'm fine!

01:39.933 --> 01:41.351
I can get surgery.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.938
I can have the surgery, so don't worry.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.152
That's not what I mean.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.950
I'm going to be hospitalized soon anyway.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.661
I don't want to be here
any sooner than that.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.456
I hate hospitals.

02:04.415 --> 02:05.542
Please move.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.876
Excuse us.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.972
The person you are calling cannot be...

02:19.055 --> 02:21.057
This punk is ignoring my calls now.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.567
Thank you.

02:30.775 --> 02:31.776
Do you have medication?

02:32.777 --> 02:33.778
Don't worry.

02:34.362 --> 02:37.407
I stocked up on medication,
and my fever has gone down.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.451
Liar. Your hand is still hot.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.203
No.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.164
My hands are always hot.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.457
Good night, then.

02:46.875 --> 02:47.876
Let's go inside.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.587
Go inside.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.247
Mom, are you really okay?

03:27.165 --> 03:28.166
Of course.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.627
I'm all better now.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.047
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.177
It's Mister!

03:47.685 --> 03:50.063
-You weren't sleeping yet, right?
-Hello.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.951
Lie down before the ice melts.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.734
Put this on your forehead.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.949
Why are you being so stubborn?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.117
Lie down now.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.995
-You need the ice.
-I'm fine though.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.788
Gosh, lie down.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.504
Here, Eun-seong.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.763
See? You're still hot.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.060
Why is your neck bare
when you have a cough?

05:16.983 --> 05:17.859
Gosh.

05:23.614 --> 05:24.741
Put this around your neck.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.339
Let me help you.

05:56.522 --> 06:00.026
If your fever isn't gone by tomorrow,
you have to go to the hospital, okay?

06:00.401 --> 06:02.320
You shouldn't take this lightly.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.465
What a great morning.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.927
He left his car here.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.971
What if someone scratches it?

09:16.264 --> 09:17.265
Hey.

09:17.473 --> 09:18.558
Where are you coming from?

09:18.933 --> 09:19.934
Why?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.852
Didn't you go on your business trip?

09:21.936 --> 09:25.398
The chairman called more than 13 times.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.733
-So what did you tell him?
-What else?

09:28.025 --> 09:30.027
I said you went on a business trip
to Jeju Island.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.571
Where were you, and what were you doing?

09:31.654 --> 09:32.822
Why didn't you go?

09:32.905 --> 09:34.282
I'm going now.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.409
I'll call my dad.

09:38.160 --> 09:38.995
Gosh.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.371
Hey, Ho-jun.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.622
Yes? What?

09:42.832 --> 09:43.833
By the way,

09:44.875 --> 09:46.252
Hye-su will probably be off sick today.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.004
Go up and check on her later.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.506
If she's still sick,
take her to the hospital.

09:50.798 --> 09:51.924
She's sick?

09:54.051 --> 09:56.637
Why are you taking care of her
so much, though?

09:56.887 --> 09:59.473
This is why the employees
are getting the wrong idea and--

10:01.267 --> 10:02.268
Okay.

10:03.811 --> 10:04.770
I'll be back.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.230
-Okay.
-Thanks.

10:07.481 --> 10:08.482
Hey.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.994
ONLY EMPLOYEES ALLOWED

10:20.119 --> 10:21.871
-Excuse me.
-What?

10:23.039 --> 10:24.081
What are you doing there?

10:26.208 --> 10:27.418
Oh, my.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.088
Look who this is.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.591
Why are you snooping around
in front of someone else's house?

10:33.716 --> 10:34.717
Gosh.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.094
I wasn't snooping around.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.305
Hye-su isn't just anyone.

10:39.472 --> 10:43.225
I heard she was sick,
so as her superior, I was worried.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.477
She's sick?

10:44.560 --> 10:46.062
How is it that every time I see you,

10:46.145 --> 10:49.231
your even more beautiful than before?
You're glowing.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.525
Do you do something special to your skin?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.487
You shine much more than I do.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.617
What's wrong? Where does it hurt?

10:59.992 --> 11:02.495
It's just a cold. I'm fine now.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.747
Mom was very sick.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.667
She was burning up, so Mister made...

11:09.335 --> 11:10.336
What was that?

11:10.544 --> 11:13.005
I took some medication for my fever,

11:13.672 --> 11:15.299
and I'm all better now.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.385
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

11:17.676 --> 11:18.552
Of course.

11:21.931 --> 11:22.932
Hye-su,

11:23.933 --> 11:24.934
I'm sorry...

11:26.936 --> 11:28.062
about Seung-ju.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.691
Eun-seong,
why don't you go and brush your teeth?

11:32.817 --> 11:35.403
That's right. Go and brush your teeth.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.404
Okay.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.532
Wash your face, too.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.161
Why did you tell him?

11:44.495 --> 11:45.955
Well, you see,

11:46.789 --> 11:49.208
Seung-ju kept saying

11:49.291 --> 11:51.377
that he'd go talk to him.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.671
He said he was suspicious
of your relationship.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.758
I was afraid he'd cause trouble,

11:57.883 --> 11:59.301
so it just slipped.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.095
I'm sorry.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.222
I'll make sure he doesn't talk.

12:03.305 --> 12:06.600
Gosh, me and my big mouth.

12:06.725 --> 12:07.726
Wait a second.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.062
He hasn't caused trouble already, has he?

12:12.231 --> 12:13.983
I'm the one who caused trouble.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.734
What?

12:16.193 --> 12:17.319
I'm sorry

12:18.070 --> 12:19.697
to Seung-ju and you both.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.366
You're always worrying over me.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.040
Are you sure you're feeling better?

12:32.334 --> 12:34.170
How can you get surgery in this condition?

12:34.712 --> 12:36.380
Don't worry, and just go.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.048
I need to go, too.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.217
Okay.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.720
Your throat is swollen too, isn't it?

12:42.928 --> 12:44.638
What is that you have wrapped
around your throat?

12:45.389 --> 12:46.390
This?

12:48.767 --> 12:49.894
-Awesome.
-Right?

12:49.977 --> 12:51.228
-Right?
-Totally.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.313
Incredible!

12:53.230 --> 12:55.483
The Promise is the best!

12:55.608 --> 12:56.567
-Yes!
-Yes!

12:56.650 --> 12:58.235
-Thank you.
-Yes.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.612
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.614
Come again.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.073
We'll come back next time.

13:04.241 --> 13:06.076
Gosh.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.661
Good work today, Hye-su.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.831
You're not even well. Go up and rest.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.374
Don't act like you care.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.751
If you cared so much,

13:13.876 --> 13:15.628
you shouldn't have taken customers in
at that hour.

13:15.753 --> 13:19.006
They came all the way from Busan
just to eat our food.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.175
How could I turn them back?

13:21.300 --> 13:23.052
Gosh, you're so frustrating.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.678
Hye-su,

13:25.679 --> 13:26.680
go on up.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.140
Yes, I will.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.267
Don't worry. I feel fine.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.477
I'm all better.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.646
Even so. We were closing up,

13:33.771 --> 13:35.064
and you told them to come in.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.524
How could you do that?

13:36.690 --> 13:38.442
Come on now, Chef.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.736
I get it.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.780
Just let it go this one time.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.158
Has something been bugging you lately?

13:46.242 --> 13:48.827
Why so snappy?

13:49.453 --> 13:50.704
Buy me a drink.

13:51.288 --> 13:52.831
Tonight is a bit...

13:53.332 --> 13:55.543
I'm not feeling well today.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.711
-Where are we going?
-Follow me.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.088
Be quiet and come with me.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.339
Where are we going?

14:00.464 --> 14:02.591
-Hongdae.
-Hongdae?

14:17.731 --> 14:18.983
Are you back already?

14:24.446 --> 14:25.573
I finished

14:26.156 --> 14:27.408
earlier than expected.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.744
Where's Ho-jun?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.121
He just left.

14:32.746 --> 14:33.747
I'm not surprised.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.794
Listen, do you enjoy being in pain?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.462
I told you to rest.

14:41.338 --> 14:44.174
Are you determined to faint on the job
and hurt the company?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.635
I came to work because I felt better.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.637
I'm better thanks to you.

14:48.971 --> 14:49.972
Thank you.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.351
Where's Eun-seong?

14:54.602 --> 14:55.769
My friend's looking after her.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.229
I'm going to pick her up now.

14:59.857 --> 15:00.858
I'll get going, then.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.403
Have you eaten yet?

15:06.864 --> 15:09.074
I had an early dinner,

15:09.491 --> 15:10.492
so I'm hungry.

15:11.368 --> 15:14.538
I'm going to grill a steak,
so come and give me some guidance.

15:14.788 --> 15:15.956
Guidance?

15:16.415 --> 15:20.044
I'm nervous about cooking
in front of an expert.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.339
I'll just cook it for you.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.758
Aren't you tired of cooking all the time?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.844
I'm going to show off my skills,

15:32.222 --> 15:33.557
so sit here,

15:34.016 --> 15:35.434
nag at me, and taste it for me.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.227
No, I'll just...

15:38.562 --> 15:39.772
I may not do it now,

15:39.897 --> 15:41.941
but I used to cook all my meals myself.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.525
But still, I...

15:50.366 --> 15:51.367
I'll help...

16:00.542 --> 16:02.169
-The hat?
-Gosh.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.629
I know.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.922
Turn this on...

16:12.471 --> 16:13.472
Next is...

16:21.772 --> 16:22.773
What do you think?

16:33.242 --> 16:35.160
The plating isn't too bad.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.501
Here. Taste it.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.718
It's good, too.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.094
Then eat it all, okay?

16:52.594 --> 16:53.595
No way.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.056
You said you were hungry.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.142
You need to eat to get better.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.227
You're being stubborn
and not going to the hospital.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.896
Would you have eaten if I didn't say
I was hungry?

17:03.981 --> 17:05.024
I feel bad enough already,

17:05.524 --> 17:07.985
and I don't want to hear
that we overworked you.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.615
Eat this and feel better
so that you can work.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.080
Thank you.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.170
Hold on.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.255
It's burnt here.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.090
Don't eat the burnt parts.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.768
Eat slowly.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.519
You won't even go to the hospital.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.230
You'll get indigestion
from eating too fast.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.738
This is pretty nice.

17:52.946 --> 17:53.947
What is?

17:54.656 --> 17:56.408
Sitting and eating as a customer.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.495
So this is what it feels like

18:00.370 --> 18:01.497
to be a customer.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.131
Have some wine too, ma'am.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.218
It's not my fault if you get indigestion.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.406
Okay.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.243
I'll call you later.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.285
Okay.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.383
Who left the kitchen like this?

18:55.843 --> 18:57.302
Chef.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.021
What's this?

19:14.653 --> 19:15.988
Why this woman...

19:32.713 --> 19:33.714
Here they are.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.424
My cat ears.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.971
Mr. Park.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.056
Are you upstairs?

19:45.142 --> 19:46.977
Are you still here?

19:49.688 --> 19:50.689
Oh, my.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.741
Hey.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.826
Of course.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.330
I'll be right there.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.539
Okay.

20:08.832 --> 20:09.833
Ms. Kang.

20:11.668 --> 20:12.669
Ms. Kang?

20:13.170 --> 20:14.171
Ms. Kang.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.472
I thought I left it in my locker,
but it's not there.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.474
I must have left it at home.

20:27.768 --> 20:28.894
Hi, sweetie.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.860
No. I'm leaving now.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.111
Where are you?

20:59.132 --> 21:00.676
Are you all right--

21:02.261 --> 21:04.388
Why did you make us hide
when we haven't done anything wrong?

21:04.638 --> 21:06.932
I'm sorry. It's just that A-ra can't know.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.393
Why not?

21:10.394 --> 21:11.395
I know, right?

21:12.187 --> 21:13.188
My gosh.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.735
Have some pumpkin porridge.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.488
When did you make this?

21:21.905 --> 21:22.906
I didn't.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.242
Someone left it.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.536
Who?

21:27.703 --> 21:29.496
Who else would leave it for us?

21:30.414 --> 21:32.749
I could tell who it was
after one spoonful.

21:34.751 --> 21:35.752
Gosh.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.088
She can't mind her own business.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.468
Here.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.220
Take this to Eun-seong.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.933
I packed them for her a while back.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.728
They're clothes and socks for Eun-seong.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.606
Give this to her for me.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.276
You do it yourself.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.862
You give it to her.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.990
I caused a scene that time.
How can I show up with this?

22:06.283 --> 22:07.284
Seung-ju.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.996
I think I should be a better person now

22:12.039 --> 22:15.292
and wish them a happy life.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.837
I'll do it for my granddaughter

22:20.505 --> 22:22.549
and my dead son.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.385
I'm going to give them my blessing

22:25.677 --> 22:26.928
for their new life together.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.181
Good thinking.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.187
It's good if she's happy,

22:36.980 --> 22:37.981
right?

22:40.859 --> 22:42.819
It's good if at least someone
is happy, right?

22:44.071 --> 22:45.614
There you go again.

22:46.364 --> 22:47.407
You're going to cry again.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.284
Just eat the porridge.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.787
Don't start your day in tears.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.001
This tastes so good.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.176
Hye-su.

23:12.849 --> 23:13.850
Thanks for the porridge.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.436
She said this is for Eun-seong.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.898
I didn't say anything. Don't worry.

23:22.692 --> 23:23.735
She wants you to be happy.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.445
She said not to worry about us,

23:25.529 --> 23:27.239
and just live a happy life.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.533
Thanks.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.118
I'll use it well.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.913
She said not to call to thank her.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.457
She said not to bring things
like pumpkin porridge, either.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.920
That's all. I relayed all the messages.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.714
When is the surgery?

23:46.007 --> 23:47.259
I go in this weekend.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.344
Okay. Good luck.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.264
Seung-ju.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.849
Okay, I get it.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.059
Your secret is safe. Don't worry.

24:05.402 --> 24:08.405
What has gotten into you?

24:08.738 --> 24:10.699
You said you were coming back
after a few days.

24:10.782 --> 24:13.785
Where did you go, leaving a sick person
to watch the restaurant?

24:13.869 --> 24:15.412
You're unbelievable.

24:16.872 --> 24:17.873
Come here.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.500
I said, come over here.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.043
-Why?
-Come on.

24:23.336 --> 24:24.337
What?

24:24.546 --> 24:25.547
You...

24:26.006 --> 24:27.591
Tell me the truth.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.136
Why are you so nice to Hye-su?

24:34.556 --> 24:36.016
Can I think whatever I want?

24:40.645 --> 24:42.022
Think whatever you want.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.191
Then...

24:44.691 --> 24:47.694
Then do you like her?

24:49.070 --> 24:50.197
Do you like her?

24:52.782 --> 24:54.868
-Does it look like it?
-Yes.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.456
Why are you suddenly overestimating me?

24:59.581 --> 25:01.208
Will you believe me
if I say I like someone?

25:01.291 --> 25:02.167
No way.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.670
I'd believe it if you say
you're playing around with her.

25:06.546 --> 25:07.547
Hey.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.758
I'm not that big of a jerk.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.009
Didn't you know?

25:16.056 --> 25:17.098
Fine.

25:17.599 --> 25:18.600
I know I am.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.185
Don't worry.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.479
Even if I may be a jerk,

25:22.938 --> 25:24.814
I'm trying not to go that low.

25:27.984 --> 25:28.985
I'll probably just

25:29.694 --> 25:30.987
toy with her and then dump her.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.783
I even bought her liver with money.

25:36.826 --> 25:37.953
If I dump her too,

25:39.246 --> 25:40.622
that would just be despicable.

25:41.414 --> 25:42.415
I really am a jerk.

25:43.166 --> 25:47.295
I mean, there's no need to be so negative.

25:47.796 --> 25:51.383
It's just that you've been acting
so strange these days.

25:51.466 --> 25:52.467
Goodness.

25:57.097 --> 25:59.557
-Mister.
-Eun-seong.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.893
Come with me.
I need to show you something.

26:01.977 --> 26:02.978
What is it?

26:04.271 --> 26:05.272
Eun-seong.

26:05.939 --> 26:09.025
Mom, wait just one minute, okay?

26:09.567 --> 26:10.986
-Let's go.
-Come.

26:11.861 --> 26:12.862
What...

26:16.449 --> 26:17.617
What is it?

26:18.618 --> 26:20.829
Look. They're triplet kittens.

26:21.162 --> 26:22.455
You raise kittens?

26:22.747 --> 26:24.916
They're not mine.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.668
They're stray cats.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.378
I fed one of them,

26:28.461 --> 26:31.298
and it brought its siblings, too. Right?

26:31.631 --> 26:33.258
I don't think they have a mom or dad.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.845
This one is Chubby. This one is Cutie.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.263
And this one is Blackie.

26:38.930 --> 26:39.931
Aren't they cute?

26:41.516 --> 26:43.977
Hey, he's going to be my new dad.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.689
I'm sorry I'm the only one getting a dad.

26:49.733 --> 26:50.984
You must be hungry.

26:51.651 --> 26:53.194
I'll feed you.

26:57.991 --> 26:58.992
Eun-seong.

26:59.909 --> 27:01.703
You can't keep feeding them
things like that.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.496
Salty food makes cats sick.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.082
Let's go and buy cat food together later.

27:06.833 --> 27:07.834
Okay.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.466
Blackie is getting away.

27:14.549 --> 27:15.550
There it is.

27:17.677 --> 27:18.678
Here.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.055
Eun-seong, there goes Cutie.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.350
They're all troublemakers.

27:24.601 --> 27:28.063
Why are their names Chubby,
Cutie, and Blackie?

27:28.313 --> 27:29.564
Because they're chubby,

27:29.773 --> 27:30.774
black,

27:30.982 --> 27:31.983
and cute.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.820
Gosh, you're so foolish.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.531
How could you ask that?

27:38.615 --> 27:41.368
You're right. I'm a fool.

27:41.534 --> 27:43.953
I'm a fool.

27:57.133 --> 27:58.259
Dad.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.221
When did you get here?

28:06.351 --> 28:07.477
You pathetic man.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.109
Mister... Mom.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.568
Sir.

28:16.277 --> 28:17.237
You.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.750
You told me you were living here
to work on the restaurant

28:31.584 --> 28:33.294
and that you were working night and day,

28:33.670 --> 28:35.964
but this is what you were doing in secret?

28:38.007 --> 28:39.259
Good going.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.428
Who was that kid?

28:42.220 --> 28:43.221
Is she that woman's child?

28:45.557 --> 28:47.434
-Yes.
-How much did you pay her?

28:48.101 --> 28:51.396
-Pardon?
-For marrying you and getting surgery.

28:53.189 --> 28:56.151
Are you even acting like that kid's dad?

28:57.026 --> 28:58.695
So that you won't get caught?

29:01.364 --> 29:04.325
Gosh. You are so gracious.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.245
I'm sorry.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.373
Will you walk into prison yourself,
or shall I report you?

29:11.249 --> 29:12.876
-Dad.
-Do you

29:13.001 --> 29:14.627
even realize what you've done?

29:15.545 --> 29:17.088
It's organ trade!

29:17.672 --> 29:20.925
What do you think will happen
if the media gets a whiff of this?

29:21.468 --> 29:23.803
The company your dad
worked all his life to build

29:24.012 --> 29:26.055
will crumble within hours.

29:26.765 --> 29:30.643
If they say Han Seong-guk's second son did
this and that

29:31.102 --> 29:32.979
and print it on the front page,

29:33.062 --> 29:34.981
what do you think will happen?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.402
-I have no words.
-I bet you don't.

29:40.069 --> 29:41.446
Get a divorce right away,

29:42.071 --> 29:43.072
and call off the surgery.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.242
Dad,

29:47.202 --> 29:48.787
the surgery is a week away.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.079
So?

29:50.205 --> 29:51.623
Mom's life is at stake.

29:52.499 --> 29:53.625
Please let it go just this once.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.710
Let it go?

29:55.794 --> 29:58.963
Is that what you're planning on
telling the police?

30:00.048 --> 30:01.841
What do you take me for?

30:02.175 --> 30:04.177
Do you not take me seriously

30:04.260 --> 30:05.804
just because I walk with a cane?

30:05.887 --> 30:06.888
Dad.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.390
Please, just this once.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.101
You intend on doing what you want,
is that it?

30:13.228 --> 30:14.229
Fine.

30:14.813 --> 30:15.814
Then I will also

30:16.356 --> 30:17.357
do what I want.

30:19.943 --> 30:20.944
Dad.

30:23.947 --> 30:24.948
You're pathetic.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.784
I never want to see you again.

30:49.722 --> 30:51.683
Let's have dinner.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.522
Who was that old man?

31:00.149 --> 31:01.526
His dad.

31:03.361 --> 31:06.114
Did Mister do something bad?

31:06.447 --> 31:07.448
Yes.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.660
I feel bad for him.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.495
I know.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.205
What an evil old man.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.417
Even if Mister did something bad,

31:17.750 --> 31:19.919
he shouldn't hit him. Right?

31:21.004 --> 31:22.005
You're right.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.056
-Is it good?
-Yes.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.644
You're good enough to be a chef.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.920
ONLY EMPLOYEES ALLOWED

32:12.764 --> 32:14.390
You fixed the sensor lights.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.021
Are you okay?

32:20.563 --> 32:22.065
It was bound to happen.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.067
I feel relieved.

32:26.611 --> 32:27.612
Are you bleeding?

32:29.447 --> 32:30.448
It's fine.

32:34.327 --> 32:35.328
How's Eun-seong?

32:36.037 --> 32:37.038
She must have been shocked.

32:37.413 --> 32:38.581
Eun-seong is...

32:38.915 --> 32:41.459
Okay. I know what you want to say.

32:42.418 --> 32:44.170
I won't be good to her from now on.

32:45.463 --> 32:48.424
But still, I can't distance myself
from her overnight.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.386
I'll do it slowly, step by step.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.054
Don't worry.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.264
That's not it.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.935
Eun-seong is very worried about you.

33:02.689 --> 33:03.940
Hang in there.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.280
Are you consoling me?

33:12.156 --> 33:13.825
Who's consoling who?

33:13.908 --> 33:15.451
You're in no position to do that.

33:16.285 --> 33:17.537
Don't mind me

33:18.287 --> 33:19.956
and just prepare for the surgery.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.709
I know I'm a jerk.

33:23.918 --> 33:25.628
But it'll be over
once the surgery is done.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.798
I won't have to ask you
to put on an act anymore.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.594
And I won't use you and your daughter.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.140
Mr. Han.

33:37.432 --> 33:38.599
What now?

33:39.392 --> 33:40.727
Don't be so hard on yourself.

33:42.353 --> 33:44.480
It's not easy to be so brave.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.608
You sacrificed yourself

33:48.443 --> 33:49.986
to save someone else's life.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.197
That isn't something

33:53.990 --> 33:55.825
anyone can do.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.289
See? You are bleeding.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.709
Are you all right?

34:05.960 --> 34:06.961
Doesn't it hurt?

34:07.503 --> 34:09.213
Stay still.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.514
Got it.

34:27.523 --> 34:28.649
Are you

34:29.609 --> 34:30.985
going to let Ji-hun be?

34:31.903 --> 34:32.904
What?

34:34.447 --> 34:36.532
About Na-yoon.

34:37.658 --> 34:39.368
Shall I call him in and talk to him?

34:39.494 --> 34:40.661
Call him in for what?

34:41.287 --> 34:42.872
We don't even know for sure.

34:43.623 --> 34:44.957
Stay out of it.

34:45.374 --> 34:46.375
Dad,

34:46.584 --> 34:48.669
do you really think I made it up?

34:49.670 --> 34:53.174
He got himself a fake girlfriend
and played us this entire time.

34:53.299 --> 34:56.219
He put on an act so that
he and Na-yoon wouldn't get caught.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.721
He has a huge inferiority complex
towards me.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.474
Na-yoon has a soft heart,

35:01.599 --> 35:03.309
so she fell for his tricks.

35:03.392 --> 35:06.479
You're the one that needs to get over your
inferiority complex towards your brother.

35:07.021 --> 35:08.815
Let them date if they want to.

35:09.315 --> 35:10.608
Are you that insecure?

35:10.775 --> 35:11.984
Dad!

35:18.241 --> 35:19.242
Wait.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.285
"Let them date if they want to"?

35:21.494 --> 35:23.121
How could you say that?

35:23.788 --> 35:25.581
I said it because he's being so pathetic.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.083
Honey,

35:27.834 --> 35:31.254
how do you always take Ji-hun's side
over Jeong-hun's?

35:32.130 --> 35:33.256
I do not.

35:33.548 --> 35:34.549
Fine.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.136
I'll admit that Jeong-hun is a mess.

35:39.053 --> 35:43.391
But how could you say he
has an inferiority complex towards Ji-hun?

35:44.058 --> 35:46.561
He must be saying that
because he has reason to.

35:47.770 --> 35:48.771
To be honest,

35:49.814 --> 35:51.023
I'm disappointed in

35:51.524 --> 35:52.692
Ji-hun, too.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.111
I did my best to raise him.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.988
Do you think it was easy for me,

35:57.405 --> 35:59.031
raising that woman's child?

35:59.740 --> 36:02.326
I did all I could,

36:02.660 --> 36:04.954
yet he still treats me like a guest.

36:05.246 --> 36:08.082
-To his mom, who didn't even raise him--
-Please leave.

36:08.749 --> 36:10.543
I have enough on my mind as it is.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.385
Ji-hun, it's me.

36:20.136 --> 36:23.264
Did your dad find out everything?

36:24.223 --> 36:25.224
Why?

36:25.808 --> 36:26.893
Answer me.

36:27.643 --> 36:29.353
He knows everything,

36:31.063 --> 36:32.190
doesn't he?

36:37.320 --> 36:38.988
I heard from Jeong-hun

36:40.072 --> 36:41.365
that you want to break up.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.163
I should've come to see you first,

36:47.413 --> 36:48.956
but I couldn't muster up the courage.

36:49.498 --> 36:52.543
I'm sure the parents had high hopes
for our marriage.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.046
I'm sorry for causing this trouble.

36:56.505 --> 36:58.716
I'm impatient, so I'll get right to it.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.635
Is it because of Ji-hun?

37:04.222 --> 37:05.848
I guess Jeong-hun was right.

37:06.432 --> 37:08.267
I heard you two used to date.

37:09.477 --> 37:10.937
Are you still seeing each other?

37:11.687 --> 37:12.688
No,

37:13.189 --> 37:14.315
we are not.

37:15.399 --> 37:18.402
Even if it was awkward,
was it that difficult to put it

37:18.527 --> 37:20.196
all behind you and just ignore him?

37:22.031 --> 37:24.116
Why did you break up with Ji-hun?

37:25.326 --> 37:26.869
He left me.

37:30.915 --> 37:34.168
He said he was a poor international
student without parents or siblings,

37:34.627 --> 37:36.504
and I believed him.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.966
Once my family found out and
tried to stop up from seeing each other,

37:41.968 --> 37:44.262
he cut all ties with me
and disappeared that very day.

37:45.721 --> 37:47.974
I never knew I'd see him again like this.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.142
That brat.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.561
He was quite a troublemaker back then.

37:54.230 --> 37:57.692
Even so, how could he say
that he had no parents or siblings?

37:58.484 --> 38:00.528
He went around lying to people like that?

38:03.281 --> 38:06.242
But why are you crying?

38:07.326 --> 38:08.869
Are you still not over him?

38:10.871 --> 38:11.872
I'm sorry.

38:34.812 --> 38:35.813
Dad.

38:36.605 --> 38:37.606
Dad.

38:38.190 --> 38:40.609
Did you postpone Mom's surgery?

38:43.654 --> 38:46.615
I'm here for the first time in a while,
and the company is in a mess.

38:47.241 --> 38:49.368
They can't do anything without me.

38:50.077 --> 38:52.246
Did you postpone Mom's surgery?

38:52.330 --> 38:54.290
You know the answer to that already.
It's over with.

38:54.665 --> 38:57.918
I thought we said you'd do what you want,
and I'd do what I want.

38:58.919 --> 39:00.546
Please let Mom live.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.882
I won't kill everyone
just so she can live.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.759
Still, how could you cancel the surgery?

39:05.217 --> 39:07.136
Does her life mean nothing to you?

39:07.803 --> 39:10.181
Why do you care so much about her life?

39:10.431 --> 39:12.767
She never once took care of you.

39:13.142 --> 39:16.103
She's your mother
but she never acted like a real mother.

39:16.645 --> 39:18.022
That wicked woman.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.441
How dare she ruin my son's life?

39:21.859 --> 39:24.070
You don't need to be this cruel.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.866
You act like you're some devoted son.

39:29.450 --> 39:32.495
I thought you were stronger
than your brother.

39:33.662 --> 39:35.373
I can't believe you sacrificed your life

39:35.706 --> 39:37.375
to save your mom's life.

39:37.875 --> 39:38.876
Dad.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.795
Divorce that woman immediately.

39:43.005 --> 39:44.298
I cannot divorce her.

39:48.636 --> 39:49.637
Dad,

39:49.929 --> 39:51.055
we've come this far.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.182
Please let us do the surgery.

39:54.850 --> 39:55.935
You lunatic.

39:56.519 --> 39:59.230
Are you a broken record?
Stop repeating yourself.

40:00.189 --> 40:01.816
And why didn't you tell me about Na-yoon?

40:02.108 --> 40:04.777
Were you trying to make a fool
of your brother and embarrass me?

40:04.902 --> 40:07.947
How can all my sons be so pathetic?

40:08.781 --> 40:10.825
Report to the head office
starting tomorrow,

40:10.950 --> 40:12.284
and submit your business report.

40:13.369 --> 40:14.703
Based on how you do,

40:14.829 --> 40:17.498
I'll decide whether or not
to have you locked up in jail.

40:19.708 --> 40:20.709
Dad.

41:48.005 --> 41:52.384
Gosh, why do you keep bringing food?

41:52.676 --> 41:53.761
Thanks.

41:54.011 --> 41:55.054
I'll enjoy them.

41:56.013 --> 41:58.849
I always ask you to watch Eun-seong.
I'm not shameless.

41:59.141 --> 42:01.185
It's okay.

42:03.145 --> 42:04.772
An aunt can do this much.

42:05.564 --> 42:07.525
Your surgery is in a few days.

42:08.150 --> 42:10.236
Don't worry about her,

42:10.736 --> 42:12.154
and take care of yourself.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.073
When you're in the hospital,

42:14.657 --> 42:17.034
I'll take good care of Eun-seong.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.207
Are they hiring a caregiver for you?

42:24.542 --> 42:25.543
Yes.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.673
But that Mr. Han guy...

42:32.841 --> 42:34.426
He looks like a total jerk.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.889
Does he look that mean?

42:39.682 --> 42:40.516
Yes.

42:42.268 --> 42:44.103
He doesn't just look mean.

42:44.728 --> 42:47.481
He's got "arrogant" and "I'm a total jerk"

42:47.606 --> 42:48.983
written all over his face.

42:49.483 --> 42:51.694
But after seeing him often,
I do feel sorry for him.

42:51.819 --> 42:52.653
Oh, my.

42:53.571 --> 42:54.613
Listen to yourself.

42:54.989 --> 42:57.575
What did you just say?
You feel sorry for him?

42:57.700 --> 42:59.618
You've lost your mind.

42:59.743 --> 43:03.372
Who feels sorry for who?

43:04.290 --> 43:05.291
You're right.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.252
I must have lost my mind.

43:11.088 --> 43:12.089
But then again,

43:13.549 --> 43:14.925
the more I see him,

43:15.634 --> 43:17.595
the more I feel like
he is human after all.

43:18.554 --> 43:20.264
I hope things will work out for him,

43:21.432 --> 43:23.642
and I hope he'll be at peace.

43:25.227 --> 43:26.437
I'm just saying.

43:28.939 --> 43:30.190
-Mom...
-Hey.

43:30.733 --> 43:31.567
Sorry.

43:31.942 --> 43:33.068
You woke her up.

43:33.819 --> 43:35.237
You busybody.

43:35.738 --> 43:37.489
Worry about yourself.

43:38.073 --> 43:40.993
Right. He's your husband, is that it?

43:41.327 --> 43:42.828
Don't be confused.

43:42.911 --> 43:44.663
Snap out of it.

43:45.831 --> 43:47.458
Yes, ma'am.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.835
Is your cold gone?

43:49.918 --> 43:51.003
How's your fever?

43:51.086 --> 43:52.671
And your headache?

43:52.796 --> 43:53.964
I'm completely better.

43:54.423 --> 43:56.008
I was so worried.

43:56.925 --> 43:58.844
It was just a cold.

44:00.179 --> 44:01.597
What does that even mean?

44:02.473 --> 44:03.474
What?

44:04.350 --> 44:05.351
Well...

44:06.310 --> 44:08.437
We just have to hang in there
for one more week.

44:09.063 --> 44:10.189
Just one more week.

44:11.523 --> 44:12.900
It'll be over in one week.

44:15.110 --> 44:16.904
I'm so happy, Eun-seong.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.827
Why was your surgery suddenly pushed back,
Ms. Oh?

44:26.246 --> 44:27.247
I don't know.

44:29.625 --> 44:30.876
I wonder why.

44:37.007 --> 44:38.133
The surgery...

44:39.385 --> 44:42.429
I think I lost my chance.

44:47.893 --> 44:50.104
I think it's all over.

44:54.274 --> 44:56.568
-Clean up as you work.
-Yes, Chef.

44:56.652 --> 44:58.112
How many times do I have to tell you?

44:59.071 --> 45:00.656
Gyeong-min, where's the dishrag?

45:00.739 --> 45:02.658
I'll bring it right over.

45:02.741 --> 45:04.576
Put things where they belong.

45:06.078 --> 45:07.663
Wash the dishes properly.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.456
Imagine that you're the ones
eating off them.

45:22.761 --> 45:24.012
Hye-su, what's wrong?

45:28.058 --> 45:29.059
You're bleeding.

45:32.438 --> 45:33.564
Gyeong-min, get me a band-aid.

45:40.654 --> 45:41.655
Why are you so pale?

45:43.323 --> 45:44.366
It's nothing.

45:45.367 --> 45:46.535
I just have a headache.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.788
I thought you were better.
Are you sick again?

45:50.330 --> 45:51.707
That cold is lasting long.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.918
Go to the hospital.
I'll switch you to the dinner shift.

45:56.044 --> 45:57.045
I'm fine.

45:58.130 --> 45:59.548
Go to the hospital.

46:00.048 --> 46:02.634
Don't you know that a sick person
shouldn't be handling food?

46:03.177 --> 46:04.178
Go, now.

46:04.636 --> 46:05.512
Give it to me.

46:05.596 --> 46:06.972
Here. Put this on.

46:29.328 --> 46:31.038
THE DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSURGERY

46:31.121 --> 46:32.164
Mr. Jeon Hyeon-seuk.

46:32.247 --> 46:33.248
Yes.

46:48.931 --> 46:49.932
You're here.

46:51.391 --> 46:52.392
Hello.

46:52.809 --> 46:53.769
I'll see you later.

47:00.317 --> 47:01.485
Ms. Lee Yu-ra.

47:07.074 --> 47:08.492
You look better today.

47:08.617 --> 47:09.618
Come in.

47:38.897 --> 47:39.898
Ms. Kang Hye-su.

47:43.527 --> 47:44.570
Ms. Kang Hye-su?

47:51.368 --> 47:52.411
Ms. Kang Hye-su.

47:53.912 --> 47:54.913
Ms. Kang Hye-su.

47:55.998 --> 47:57.040
Ms. Kang Hye-su.

48:21.356 --> 48:22.983
-Hello?
-Ms. Kang Hye-su?

48:24.192 --> 48:26.153
This is Ji-hun's dad.

48:27.446 --> 48:28.947
We met before.

48:38.206 --> 48:39.207
Ho-jun.

48:43.128 --> 48:44.630
Oh, hey.

48:46.840 --> 48:47.966
Where's Hye-su?

48:48.884 --> 48:51.178
Isn't she upstairs?

48:51.637 --> 48:53.055
She's on the dinner shift,

48:53.764 --> 48:54.765
so I'm sure she'll be back.

48:56.933 --> 48:59.353
How is your dad, by the way?

48:59.645 --> 49:00.771
Is he still angry?

49:02.731 --> 49:06.401
He must be upset, but what can he do?

49:06.485 --> 49:07.486
With time,

49:08.362 --> 49:10.822
he'll understand how you feel.

49:11.323 --> 49:13.617
Don't be too upset.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.553
What type of food

49:33.970 --> 49:35.639
does your grandmother in Japan like?

49:45.107 --> 49:46.733
I have a dinner appointment today.

49:47.109 --> 49:49.611
I'd like to get a recommendation
from an expert.

49:52.447 --> 49:54.491
I am--

49:54.700 --> 49:56.076
You insolent girl.

49:56.535 --> 49:57.994
What did you take me for,

49:58.203 --> 49:59.996
daring to pull such a trick on me?

50:00.622 --> 50:02.374
How did you live your life before

50:02.457 --> 50:04.459
that you'd fearlessly commit such a crime?

50:06.211 --> 50:08.714
I wanted to have you locked up
immediately, but I just restrained myself

50:08.922 --> 50:10.966
only because my son was involved.

50:11.383 --> 50:12.968
Sign the divorce papers
and bring them to me.

50:13.176 --> 50:14.553
Return the money as well.

50:14.970 --> 50:16.179
Let me get a memorandum too,

50:16.513 --> 50:19.516
saying that you'll pretend
none of this happened.

50:20.934 --> 50:22.185
If you tell anyone about this,

50:22.519 --> 50:24.938
you're dead. Got it?

50:25.772 --> 50:26.773
Get out.

50:30.736 --> 50:31.862
What about the surgery?

50:33.822 --> 50:34.948
The surgery?

50:35.323 --> 50:37.325
How dare you bring up the surgery?

50:39.327 --> 50:40.328
No.

50:41.621 --> 50:43.081
I need to have the surgery.

50:47.669 --> 50:49.212
It's only a few days away.

50:51.047 --> 50:53.258
We've worked so hard for this.

50:54.968 --> 50:56.344
We've foolishly done

50:57.679 --> 50:58.764
so much

50:59.598 --> 51:00.682
for this.

51:03.769 --> 51:05.228
No. I can't get divorced.

51:06.313 --> 51:07.689
I will get this surgery.

51:11.151 --> 51:12.152
Sir,

51:13.487 --> 51:14.571
I'm begging you.

51:15.739 --> 51:16.782
Just once.

51:17.866 --> 51:19.284
Just this once.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.161
Please.

51:22.621 --> 51:24.122
Please, just this once.

51:25.248 --> 51:27.417
Do you still not understand
what is going on?

51:28.084 --> 51:30.045
Do you think you'll get money
out of doing this?

51:30.629 --> 51:32.130
You're a professional, aren't you?

51:32.214 --> 51:34.049
You need to go to prison
to come to your senses.

51:34.674 --> 51:36.635
I'll send an attorney,
so write up the divorce papers

51:36.760 --> 51:37.886
and sign the memorandum.

51:38.303 --> 51:40.806
And leave Ji-hun right now.

51:41.306 --> 51:44.392
You should be happy I'm ending it at this.

51:45.393 --> 51:46.686
Wait. Sir...

52:30.313 --> 52:32.148
MOTHER

52:39.281 --> 52:40.282
Yes, Mother.

52:41.199 --> 52:43.410
I just felt really bad.

52:44.452 --> 52:46.955
I thought I should say something
to you myself

52:47.330 --> 52:50.041
so that I'd feel better.
That's why I called.

52:51.710 --> 52:52.711
I see.

52:54.004 --> 52:57.299
I don't resent you.

52:59.342 --> 53:01.177
I was just sad about my life

53:02.095 --> 53:04.389
and took it out on you.

53:05.807 --> 53:08.101
So don't take it to heart, okay?

53:10.854 --> 53:11.855
And

53:12.647 --> 53:14.024
have a good life.

53:15.317 --> 53:17.027
I wanted to say that to you.
That's why I called.

53:18.778 --> 53:21.072
Receive lots of love from that man.

53:22.073 --> 53:24.159
The love that my Seok-hwan
was not able to give you.

53:25.911 --> 53:27.579
And live a long, happy life.

53:30.248 --> 53:31.583
And tell that man

53:33.418 --> 53:35.378
that I ask him not to mistreat Eun-seong

53:35.921 --> 53:37.297
and to be good to her.

53:38.340 --> 53:39.841
Please tell him that for me.

53:42.260 --> 53:43.511
Thank you.

53:46.014 --> 53:47.849
What's wrong with your voice?

53:49.142 --> 53:50.685
I caught a cold.

53:51.686 --> 53:52.854
Take care of your health.

53:53.480 --> 53:54.731
Did you take medication?

53:55.398 --> 53:56.399
Yes.

53:56.858 --> 53:58.193
Good. Okay.

53:58.860 --> 54:02.030
I have a customer. Bye.

54:02.113 --> 54:03.198
Okay.

54:06.576 --> 54:09.037
Hello. Would you like something?

54:30.308 --> 54:31.518
Excuse me.

55:53.600 --> 55:55.143
CALLING KANG HYE-SU

55:55.268 --> 55:57.353
The phone has been turned off.

55:57.479 --> 56:00.148
Please leave a message after the tone.

56:06.029 --> 56:08.073
I lost my phone.
Do you mind if I look for it?

56:08.239 --> 56:09.824
-Sure. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

56:30.470 --> 56:31.596
Good night.

56:32.055 --> 56:33.056
Good night.

56:33.306 --> 56:36.476
Excuse me. Did anyone turn in
a cell phone, by any chance?

56:36.893 --> 56:39.646
No. Nothing was turned in today.

56:39.729 --> 56:42.398
Then I'll look a bit more. I'm sorry.

56:43.691 --> 56:44.692
Hey.

56:44.776 --> 56:46.611
That bus didn't run today.

56:47.195 --> 56:49.906
You don't even know which bus,
and you're going to look through them all?

56:51.324 --> 56:54.035
How can a young person like you
be so careless?

56:54.369 --> 56:55.370
My gosh.

57:00.708 --> 57:03.002
Sir, I'm not careless.

57:04.295 --> 57:06.131
I'm not careless.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.722
I'm not careless.

57:16.099 --> 57:17.892
I'm not careless!

57:22.480 --> 57:23.898
I'm not.

57:53.094 --> 57:54.220
What...

58:45.563 --> 58:48.107
What do I do now?

59:07.794 --> 59:09.921
I want to live.

59:26.396 --> 59:27.730
This is unfair.

59:56.634 --> 59:58.511
Take this and fill it in.

59:58.595 --> 59:59.470
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

1:00:00.305 --> 1:00:01.306
Dad.

1:00:01.431 --> 1:00:02.974
I don't know if it was your idea,

1:00:03.516 --> 1:00:06.019
or if that woman conned you into it,

1:00:06.894 --> 1:00:09.147
but what if she uses it against you later?

1:00:09.272 --> 1:00:10.398
Do you have a contract?

1:00:11.316 --> 1:00:12.650
She isn't like that.

1:00:12.734 --> 1:00:14.569
Since when were you this naive?

1:00:14.694 --> 1:00:15.778
"She isn't like that"?

1:00:16.112 --> 1:00:17.697
How can you trust people like her?

1:00:18.114 --> 1:00:20.241
She sold her liver for money.

1:00:20.491 --> 1:00:21.868
She has nothing to fear.

1:00:23.953 --> 1:00:25.038
She's a weird one.

1:00:25.246 --> 1:00:26.789
I became surer of it when I met her.

1:00:27.248 --> 1:00:30.585
She clung to my leg and begged me
to let her get the surgery.

1:00:30.918 --> 1:00:33.630
I realized that
she shouldn't be taken lightly.

1:00:34.380 --> 1:00:35.840
You met Hye-su?

1:00:35.923 --> 1:00:36.924
Yes.

1:00:37.342 --> 1:00:39.427
She seemed flustered
that it didn't go as planned.

1:00:39.927 --> 1:00:42.555
Consider yourself lucky
that it ended here.

1:00:42.805 --> 1:00:44.098
What did you say to her?

1:00:44.349 --> 1:00:45.725
Why do you care?

1:00:46.517 --> 1:00:49.145
-Just fill this in.
-What did you say to her?

1:00:49.270 --> 1:00:50.688
What's wrong with you?

1:00:50.938 --> 1:00:54.108
She must have something big on you.

1:00:56.069 --> 1:00:57.070
Tell me

1:00:57.695 --> 1:00:58.696
what you said to her.

1:00:58.905 --> 1:01:00.782
What would I say?

1:01:01.074 --> 1:01:02.075
I took care of it.

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:05.662
I wanted to make her disappear,

1:01:06.454 --> 1:01:07.455
but I stopped myself.

1:01:08.081 --> 1:01:09.374
I told her to get lost.

1:01:09.457 --> 1:01:10.375
Dad!

1:01:10.833 --> 1:01:12.001
Bring me the contract.

1:01:12.335 --> 1:01:14.921
What does it say?
Why is it holding you back so much?

1:01:15.254 --> 1:01:16.589
I'll take care of it for you.

1:01:20.385 --> 1:01:21.386
That punk.

1:01:42.156 --> 1:01:43.241
ONLY EMPLOYEES ALLOWED

1:01:44.075 --> 1:01:45.076
Hye-su.

1:01:46.994 --> 1:01:47.995
Hye-su?

1:02:16.274 --> 1:02:17.650
The phone has been turned off.

1:02:17.734 --> 1:02:20.236
Please leave a message after the tone.

1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:24.157
Hye-su, where are you?

1:02:24.991 --> 1:02:26.367
Call me when you get this.

1:02:29.162 --> 1:02:30.455
Gosh.

1:02:32.832 --> 1:02:34.417
Where has she gone?

1:02:54.145 --> 1:02:55.146
Hye-su!

1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:58.065
Where in the world are you?

1:04:11.305 --> 1:04:13.307
