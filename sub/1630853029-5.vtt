We have every right
to move forward on Murder Two.

29:47.316 --> 29:50.406
- I agree with Mr. Price.
There's a case here.

29:50.449 --> 29:53.583
I'm not sure if it's winnable,
but it's certainly triable.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.803
So let's do it.

30:01.678 --> 30:03.288

were enlarged,

30:03.332 --> 30:06.378
significant pixelation
and discoloring were evident--

30:06.422 --> 30:08.554
two telltale signs
of alteration.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.382
- So they're fake?
They were photoshopped?

30:10.426 --> 30:12.602
- Yes, the images
from the young girls'

30:12.645 --> 30:16.475
legitimate social accounts were
copied and then transposed

30:16.519 --> 30:19.348
onto photos with Derek Hoyt
and vice-versa.

30:19.391 --> 30:22.873
- These fake photos were posted
to a virtual community

30:22.917 --> 30:25.397
called Rogue Wave,
a place where believers

30:25.441 --> 30:27.878

QAnon conspiracy theory

- Yes.
IP address 198.51.100.0/24.

- These statements were
also posted to Rogue Wave.

30:42.937 --> 30:45.026
Do you know which IP address
they came from?

30:45.069 --> 30:46.505

30:49.291 --> 30:51.597

- Yes.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.991
It was located
in a large corner office

30:54.035 --> 30:56.951
in a company called Audix, LLC.

30:56.994 --> 31:01.085
The nameplate on the door said,
"Jordan Reed."

31:01.129 --> 31:02.304
- Nothing further.

31:07.918 --> 31:10.399
- You have no proof Mr. Reed

31:10.442 --> 31:13.750
actually created those photos,
correct?

31:13.793 --> 31:15.883
- No, but they were sent
from his computer.

31:15.926 --> 31:20.539
- You also have no proof
Mr. Reed wrote or posted

31:20.583 --> 31:23.629
those statements to Rogue Wave?

31:23.673 --> 31:27.982

from his computer.

31:28.025 --> 31:29.157
- Nothing further.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.813
- We have the posts
and the photos.

31:33.857 --> 31:36.816
It's not perfect,
but it'll show that Reed

31:36.860 --> 31:39.167
wanted to incite action--

31:39.210 --> 31:41.386
no, that his objective

31:41.430 --> 31:43.911
was to prompt
his most zealous followers

31:43.954 --> 31:47.566
to commit an act of violence
against Derek Hoyt.

31:47.610 --> 31:50.265
- It's a good start,
but we need more

31:50.308 --> 31:52.832
to bolster our theory
of depraved indifference.

31:52.876 --> 31:56.575
We need to show Reed knew
there was a strong likelihood

31:56.619 --> 31:59.317
Manny would kill Hoyt
based on his outrageous posts

31:59.361 --> 32:00.840
and only those
outrageous posts.

32:00.884 --> 32:03.887
- We have what we have.
I mean, it'd be great

32:03.931 --> 32:05.454
if I had a beach house
in South Hampton,

32:05.497 --> 32:06.803

on the Jersey Shore

32:08.979 --> 32:11.025

32:11.068 --> 32:14.593
- We're asking the jury
to convict someone for murder,

32:14.637 --> 32:16.987
for spreading lies
on the internet.

32:17.031 --> 32:18.989
This could be ground-breaking,

32:19.033 --> 32:20.599
like convicting
Trump for the murders

32:20.643 --> 32:23.167
that took place on January 6th.

32:23.211 --> 32:25.213
We need to give the jury more.

32:58.159 --> 33:01.205
to Reed that might suggest
he'd do something violent?
