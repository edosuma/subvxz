[narrator] <i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:

00:13.638 --> 00:16.224
I was hoping I could talk to you
about your brother.

00:16.306 --> 00:18.101
He's the reason I have your face.

00:18.184 --> 00:21.354
The world's best plastic surgeon
will be reconstructing a new face for me.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.564
I leave immediately.

00:22.647 --> 00:26.276
Your publisher putting out a book
about herself by her ex? Not great optics.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.987
Adam. He leaked the photo of you
and Liam kissing.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.739
That cancer idea we came up with?

00:30.822 --> 00:31.823
Genius!

00:31.906 --> 00:34.659
Mom called me back.
I'm sending my plane to bring her home.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.327
Don't you dare get on Jeff's plane.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.329
There are other places
to build your conservatory.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.956
But Blake has to pay for what he's done.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.209
[Adam] If you come at Blake and me again,
I won't make this phone call.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.836
The top floor of the Atlantix building.

00:44.919 --> 00:48.047
The state senate was voting on a bill
to legalize sports betting in a few days.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.341
It's down to one swing vote.
Senator Braden.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.677
-This is Senator Braden.
-Should we discuss that vote?

00:52.761 --> 00:56.473
I've got everything you need
to catch a much bigger fish than me.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.390
Blake Carrington.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.104
[Liam] So, I've been thinking.
You and I need to get away.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.230
Like, badly.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.191
From your family, from mine.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.693
We can literally jet
anywhere in the world,

01:08.777 --> 01:11.821
just as long as we wind up, say,
in the same bed?

01:11.905 --> 01:15.116
[gasps] Liam! Are you suggesting
that we go someplace exotic

01:15.200 --> 01:18.161
where you'll rip off my clothes,
and we'll finally have sex?

01:18.286 --> 01:20.914
'Cause I'll be wearing something sheer
and expensive.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.582
You wouldn't want me to rip it?

01:22.665 --> 01:24.501
I need to know if I should pack two.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.086
I'll pack three.

01:26.544 --> 01:30.632
Oh, scheduling my jet to take us
to this secluded island off of Thailand...

01:30.715 --> 01:34.302
Sounds divine, but I can't go anywhere
until I expose my heinous brother

01:34.385 --> 01:36.221
for what he did at your book launch.

01:36.304 --> 01:39.182
Weird. I'm trying to take you away
from your family swamp,

01:39.265 --> 01:41.017
and you wanna slither back into it.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.685
I don't want to, I have to.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.021
Adam needs to know
that if he messes with fire

01:45.104 --> 01:50.068
he's going to get torched, and pummeled,
and kicked and possibly bitten.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.153
I've veered away from the fire analogy.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.238
Same swamp.

01:53.321 --> 01:57.242
Look. I know a parent is supposed to love
all of their children equally,

01:57.325 --> 01:59.619
but I have always been
my father's favorite. It's our thing.

01:59.702 --> 02:02.705
And then Adam weasels his way in,
and he pushes me out,

02:02.789 --> 02:05.291
and I know it sounds corny,
but I want my dad back,

02:05.375 --> 02:08.752
which means I have to ruin Adam
in my dad's eyes.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.840
How about instead of retaliating
like a savage,

02:12.465 --> 02:13.633
we take the high road?

02:14.092 --> 02:17.053
I don't know. I'm proud to say
I've mastered the low road.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.098
You take the high road with Adam.
Be classy.

02:20.431 --> 02:23.143
And you take the low road with me
in Thailand.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.228
Savage.

02:32.777 --> 02:33.611
Okay.

02:33.695 --> 02:37.699
But first golden boy's ass
is getting dragged straight to hell.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.450
Get excited!

02:39.534 --> 02:42.704
If this is another request
for an 18-wheeler filled with cereal,

02:42.787 --> 02:44.497
Mr. Carrington has said no.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.376
He doesn't share your desire to swim
in a pool full of sugary flakes.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.003
A, his loss.

02:50.086 --> 02:55.133
B, this is our itinerary
to our boys' trip to the Maldives.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.385
Only two items here,
and look at the typos.

02:57.468 --> 02:58.845
It's a work in progress.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.890
It says here we leave tomorrow
which is out of the question.

03:01.973 --> 03:06.019
My staff need at least two full days
to train for measures in my absence.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.688
What would happen if, God forbid,
there was an emergency?

03:08.771 --> 03:10.940
You mean like if brunch was late?

03:11.024 --> 03:14.402
Anders, your need of a vacation
is an emergency!

03:14.819 --> 03:16.154
Look at how tense you are!

03:16.237 --> 03:18.740
Your hands are about to wring themselves
to death.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.870
It's my belief that a vacation is best
when it's well-earned.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.414
And at this juncture, I haven't earned it.

03:27.248 --> 03:28.082
What?

03:29.375 --> 03:30.209
We need to talk.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.713
No. Tomorrow's the Atlantix's opening day,
and I have things to do.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.506
I'll only be a minute,
and I want you to note

03:35.590 --> 03:38.217
that I will be rising above the drama
I'm about to share.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.304
It's called taking the high road,
which no Carrington has ever done before,

03:41.387 --> 03:43.056
-I figured if I start-- Okay.
-Out with it.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.225
Adam, who I love deeply,

03:45.308 --> 03:49.229
attempted to inflict harm upon me
at Liam's book launch the other day,

03:49.312 --> 03:52.357
by leaking this photo to the press.

03:52.690 --> 03:56.361
Now, we both know that
Carrington-on-Carrington crime

03:56.444 --> 03:58.613
is a capital offense,
and he needs to be punished--

03:58.696 --> 04:00.156
Talking about me again, sis?

04:00.657 --> 04:02.492
It's incredible
how we have the sibling sense

04:02.575 --> 04:04.619
where we can feel the other person
thinking about us.

04:04.702 --> 04:08.289
That's funny. I don't have it.
I guess my intuition has you blocked.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.375
Adam. Is this true?

04:10.959 --> 04:14.671
Leaking damaging photos of Fallon,
or of any of us, is unforgivable.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.964
And it's reckless.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.798
Can you tell what I'm thinking now?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.843
It is true, Father.
And it was an honest mistake.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.721
I sent dozens of photos
of the event to TMZ.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.223
I wanted to get us some good press.

04:25.306 --> 04:28.101
I didn't realize that they would use one
against my dear sister.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.396
I'm deeply sorry, and this naive mistake
will never happen again.

04:32.647 --> 04:33.940
Well, no damage done.

04:34.023 --> 04:34.983
Lesson learned.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.236
Now, we have opening day work to do.
Ride with me?

04:38.319 --> 04:39.153
Shotgun!

04:39.737 --> 04:42.115
-No, you can ride in back with me.
-Even better.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.324
Hey! Wait, wait, wait.

04:43.408 --> 04:47.495
Adam also conspired with Liam's mother
to fake a cancer scare.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.872
That doesn't sound
like a naive mistake to me.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.874
No, in fact, it's reckless,
it's manipulative.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.545
Grounds for malpractice, really.
Not a great look for your team doctor.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.339
Your story's twisted, sister.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.551
Laura van Kirk came to me
for medical advice,

05:01.634 --> 05:03.970
which I provided out of a courtesy
to Liam,

05:04.053 --> 05:05.263
-who I adore.
-Please.

05:05.346 --> 05:08.850
And the inference that I knew
that she was faking cancer is outrageous.

05:08.933 --> 05:09.767
And unprovable.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.812
Daddy. Daddy.
You have known me my whole life.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.272
You have known him an hour.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.691
I would never make up
an accusation like this.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.569
-High road, remember?
-I see what's going on here.

05:19.652 --> 05:20.737
Hallelujah.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.239
You're competing with your brother,
and it needs to stop.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.157
Hallelujah.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.160
I will not tolerate juvenile behavior
from either of you,

05:27.243 --> 05:28.745
and I will not tolerate lying.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.373
I'm gonna go give Cristal
a kiss goodbye, and we are going to work.

05:32.707 --> 05:33.624
Doughnuts on the way?

05:33.708 --> 05:34.542
Mm-hm.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.922
It's gotta hurt,
knowing that Father loves me more.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.675
But I'm a doctor.
Can I do anything for the pain?

05:42.759 --> 05:43.593
I'm fine.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.678
Daddy, on the other hand,
should get an optometrist,

05:45.762 --> 05:48.181
so he can better see
what a monster you are.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.683
-I see it clear as day.
-I'm not a monster.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.728
Yes, you are, Adam. But that's all right.
Daddy will see it.

05:53.811 --> 05:57.440
And I cannot wait until he punishes
and then banishes, your demented ass.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.318
That's never gonna happen.
Because Father loves me.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.570
And so, by the way,
does your boyfriend's mother.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.784
Oh, no, did I just kiss and tell?

06:15.750 --> 06:18.336
The homecare staff
has set up inside already.

06:18.419 --> 06:22.048
Maybe we shouldn't have gotten him out
this soon. He's still so weak.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.759
[Cecil] He would've found a way to leave,
one way or another.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.220
You know how your brother gets
when things don't go his way.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.348
I don't need anyone fussing over me, okay?
I'll be fine.

06:30.431 --> 06:34.268
As long as we continue to monitor his
vitals, and remains stable, he'll be fine.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.063
And in the meanwhile,
let's get Mr. Colby into bed.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.900
Should we be concerned?
The test results still haven't come back.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.611
Dr. Mitchell wants to be thorough.
He's running every test.

06:43.694 --> 06:44.695
[Jeff] I know the results.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.490
Not to be dramatic, but I'm dying.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.826
Jeff, please. Get some rest.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.244
He's not, right?

06:51.327 --> 06:53.579
The doctor wouldn't have released him
if he wasn't stable.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.456
We'll know more when the tests come back.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.043
You'll need to fill these.
Most importantly, let him rest.

06:59.710 --> 07:02.797
No work, no visitors.
Nothing that can add any stress.

07:06.342 --> 07:07.718
This is ridiculous.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.264
I have given you Blake's head
on a silver platter.

07:11.889 --> 07:15.435
Evidence that he blackmailed a senator,
forcing her to pass legislation

07:15.518 --> 07:19.522
that now, in turn, gives the Flores family
and that greedy bastard free reign

07:19.605 --> 07:21.107
over Georgia's gambling game.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.859
A photo of Blake and the senator,

07:22.942 --> 07:26.779
an e-mail saying he bought kiosks
with the Flores family, is circumstantial.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.782
Nothing that leaves a smoking gun
in Blake's hand yet.

07:30.074 --> 07:34.871
I have given you everything that I got.
It's not like I'm holding anything back.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.668
Wear this wire. Get Blake talking.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.379
We need him explicitly
implicating himself,

07:43.463 --> 07:45.631
revealing how he forced
the senator's vote.

07:45.715 --> 07:50.928
That's not happening. If Blake caught me,
he would kill me. Or worse.

07:51.012 --> 07:54.765
Let's be clear.
The FBI is going to arrest someone.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.726
Ideally, it's Blake Carrington.

07:57.143 --> 08:01.272
But if not, it will be Mike Jones,
who committed a felony.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.734
Your head is already on a platter.

08:06.068 --> 08:06.986
-You have--
-Cancel it.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.947
I don't care if Oprah wants
to select Liam's book for her book club

08:10.031 --> 08:13.576
with Liam sitting on her lap.
I cannot be bothered. I am not happy.

08:13.659 --> 08:14.869
The high road went well?

08:14.952 --> 08:17.872
Blake refuses to see
what Adam is doing, which kills me.

08:17.955 --> 08:21.375
I will dust myself off, and I will come
roaring back on the low road,

08:21.459 --> 08:24.086
where I will bury Adam
and make sure he gets screwed.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.254
-Or...
-I already hate it.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.382
You let go of all this Adam drama,
and we escape to Thailand,

08:28.466 --> 08:29.675
where they have floating beds.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.427
Adam slept with your mother.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.600
-Let's bury the bastard.
-I've never wanted you more.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.977
-I love that.
-Eyes on the prize, Liam.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.938
We are taking down my brother.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.363
No, those stay in that room.

08:50.905 --> 08:54.200
That's not what the lady told us.
She said she needed the space?

08:54.283 --> 08:55.618
What? Which lady?

08:55.701 --> 08:57.161
The lady in the living room.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.337
[Jeff] Is everything okay?

09:11.759 --> 09:12.593
Mom.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.304
[Dominique] It's been a second, darlings.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.723
I assume you have a spare bedroom.

09:18.599 --> 09:19.559
Or maybe two.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.146
Mommy's home!

09:52.883 --> 09:55.720
Okay, listen. Here's the plan.
Once I get Adam out of his office,

09:55.803 --> 09:58.472
you swoop in and find
the confidential medical report,

09:58.556 --> 10:00.933
and then we'll leak it to the media,
which will be a disaster,

10:01.017 --> 10:03.769
and Blake will rain holy hell
on his sloppy doctor son.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.438
I've never swooped in before.

10:05.521 --> 10:08.649
I'm sure there's lots of things you've
never done, but we'll get to all of them.

10:16.991 --> 10:17.992
[knocking on glass]

10:18.200 --> 10:19.201
I need your help.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.581
I'd love to believe that, but I don't,
and I have work to do before opening day.

10:23.956 --> 10:27.585
I have an idea for a cross-over promotion
with Femperial and the Atlantix

10:27.668 --> 10:30.504
that I think our father will love,
but the truth is,

10:30.588 --> 10:32.465
he'll only go along
if he has your blessing.

10:32.548 --> 10:33.758
Because he loves me more.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.594
Fine. Yes. Now will you please
come with me to his office

10:36.677 --> 10:38.554
and encourage him to go along
with my plan?

10:38.638 --> 10:42.558
I'll accompany you, but I can't promise
that we'll sign off on your idea.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.978
Father and I are very particular
about who we partner up with.

10:46.062 --> 10:46.896
Cool.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.775
Look at us! The united brother and sister.

10:51.067 --> 10:54.070
Can you imagine all the delicious mischief
you and I would've gotten up to

10:54.153 --> 10:55.946
if we'd grown up in the same house?

10:56.280 --> 10:58.449
I like to think one of us would be dead.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.035
-[cell phone beeps]
-Oh.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.620
Uh, I forgot something in the office.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.706
Oh, hey, you know Blake's busy schedule.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.416
He'll probably only give us five minutes.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.003
And whatever it is, I'm sure
it'll certainly be there when we get back.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.380
You're right. Let's go.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.717
-Nope, gotta go now.
-No, no, no, hey.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.804
How about I go grab it,
then I'll meet you in Daddy's office,

11:19.887 --> 11:21.806
giving you two more time
to drool over each other?

11:21.889 --> 11:23.140
Mayday! Mayday!

11:24.308 --> 11:25.851
Can I help you find something?

11:27.478 --> 11:29.980
-Did you not hear me say, "Mayday"?
-That was for me?

11:30.064 --> 11:31.941
Yes! It's a signal that people use.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.528
It's a good thing that I installed
security cameras in the office.

11:35.611 --> 11:39.073
You never know who's out to get you
in the professional soccer racket.

11:39.156 --> 11:42.451
You know, I did not think it was possible
for me to hate you more, but I was wrong.

11:42.910 --> 11:43.744
So...

11:47.373 --> 11:48.499
stay out of my office.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.001
And you stay away
from my relationship with Father.

11:51.085 --> 11:54.338
-You stay away from my mother.
-You heard about that? Sweet woman.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.715
We're a good fit. Well, a tight fit.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.092
What did you say?

11:59.760 --> 12:02.471
Say it again.
How about I go screw your mother?

12:02.555 --> 12:05.224
Don't you dare talk about my mother
that way, ever!

12:07.017 --> 12:09.812
Do you hear me? Now get out of my office!

12:15.609 --> 12:16.610
No hugs?

12:19.196 --> 12:21.115
-Did you call her here?
-How?

12:21.449 --> 12:24.285
Between the time you almost died
and our way back from the hospital,

12:24.368 --> 12:26.454
I had time to make a phone call
to the devil?

12:26.537 --> 12:29.874
Don't mind me, I'll just wait here
until you're both ready to talk.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.751
How long, Dominique? Over a decade?

12:33.085 --> 12:35.212
That's how long we've been waiting.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.465
God, it must've been
one hell of a pack of cigarettes.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.967
Forget the last decade.
What about last month?

12:40.050 --> 12:42.845
You said you'd come.
I sent a plane for you.

12:43.929 --> 12:47.266
I had a last-minute invite
to perform at Swing 46.

12:47.349 --> 12:48.893
They offered me a residency.

12:49.685 --> 12:50.686
I couldn't say no.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.898
And I thought you would ask me again.
But you didn't.

12:53.981 --> 12:57.276
Do not put this on him.
He can't take the stress right now. He's--

12:57.359 --> 13:00.946
Weak. He's been in hospital
for some mystery illness.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.449
Why do you think I came?
I had to take care of my baby.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.909
How did you even know that?

13:04.992 --> 13:06.243
Your grandmother told me.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.788
I reached out to her, I always have,
to ask about you.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.708
Really? Did you pack
your mother of the year trophies?

13:12.791 --> 13:14.335
I'll shine them with my ass.

13:14.418 --> 13:15.628
-[Jeff] Monny.
-[Monica] What?

13:15.711 --> 13:18.380
I'm being hard on her
because you don't have the balls to.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.132
Look who's putting it on him now.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.426
Okay, both of you just stop. All right?

13:22.676 --> 13:25.971
I might've almost died twice,
but I can still make my own choices.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.057
Mom, please.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.602
Take whatever room or rooms you need.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.604
I'll talk to Dad.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.481
We should all have dinner tonight.

13:36.106 --> 13:36.941
What now?

13:37.024 --> 13:39.109
Can we please just focus on the present?

13:39.193 --> 13:40.194
Sure.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.072
At the present moment, I have plans.

13:43.155 --> 13:46.367
We haven't seen her in years, Monny,
I'm sure you can make tonight work.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.619
I have plans.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.046
I'm sorry that was such a phenomenal bust.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.464
It absolutely wasn't!

14:01.382 --> 14:04.385
Yes, Adam outsmarted me,
and foiled our plan,

14:04.468 --> 14:07.846
-but we just learned his weak spot.
-That he's a complete lunatic?

14:07.930 --> 14:10.140
That he's a complete lunatic about Alexis.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.518
Even better,
he doesn't know she left the country.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.770
I'm incredibly turned on by you right now.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.855
And a little terrified.

14:17.815 --> 14:18.941
That's my sweet spot.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.950
Is that all you're taking
for a ten-day trip?

14:28.033 --> 14:29.618
Correct. One carry-on bag.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.496
I have a system
when going through security.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.248
Security?

14:34.790 --> 14:36.417
We're taking the Carrington jet.

14:36.500 --> 14:40.713
The jet is for business purposes
or Carrington vacations only.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.339
This is a Carrington vacation.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.049
By proxy.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.135
Point is, we're doing this in style.

14:46.218 --> 14:51.432
Oh. I already booked on-flight massages
to rid you of manor-separation anxiety.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.726
-Ready?
-Oh, Anders. Are you free?

14:54.143 --> 14:56.312
Oh course. How may I assist?

14:57.354 --> 15:01.817
Okay, something is going on with you two,
and I am dying to know what it is.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.194
No, I'm just kidding. I don't care.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.779
But I do need you.

15:05.863 --> 15:09.158
It's a very important, very sensitive,
and highly private matter.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.952
You're not getting out of this, Anders!

15:12.036 --> 15:15.039
If I have to stuff you in a bag
and carry you on myself,

15:15.122 --> 15:16.373
we're going on vacation.

15:16.749 --> 15:20.419
Trust me. Sports betting in Georgia
is gonna be more popular than peaches.

15:20.502 --> 15:23.130
More profitable for us. AXFC!

15:27.009 --> 15:29.345
That was a master-class in salesmanship.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.847
Now everybody's onboard
with these damn kiosks.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.016
Hell, even I'm coming around to the idea.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.894
Easy to make a sale
when you actually believe in the product.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.980
Yeah, having lady luck on your side
helps a little bit, too.

15:40.064 --> 15:43.108
You gotta admit, the timing
of that gaming bill was clutch.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.904
Luck is for the lazy. Our one-of-a-kind,
in-stadium betting experience

15:46.987 --> 15:49.406
is made possible
by my planning and preparation.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.532
How so?

15:50.616 --> 15:53.035
Because I'm behind every decision.
Every choice.

15:53.118 --> 15:56.372
Okay, if you're behind every move,
then how'd you sway the vote?

15:56.455 --> 15:59.625
Sometimes you just have to take matters
into your own hands.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.377
I made a unilateral decision.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.340
Like I said, I am the maestro.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.133
Come on, how did you do it?

16:08.217 --> 16:10.803
Did you get Senator Braden
to push the bill through?

16:10.886 --> 16:11.887
Senator Braden?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.974
Yeah. I saw her here the other night,
so I assumed--

16:15.474 --> 16:17.643
Well, you assumed wrong. She loves soccer,

16:17.726 --> 16:20.729
she wanted to see behind the scenes
of the city's greatest franchise.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.648
Enough of this fanboying.

16:23.607 --> 16:26.610
Plenty of time to pick my brain
after tomorrow. Back to work.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.701
Ah. There you are, Master Adam.

I've just been, uh, in the loft.

16:35.869 --> 16:38.831
-Alexis needs to see you right away.
-Is it something I've done?

16:38.914 --> 16:41.291
Well, I wouldn't know anything
about that, sir,

16:41.375 --> 16:43.585
but, she does seem to be in a lot of pain.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.588

-I know.

I came here to talk to you.
Crazy things are happening, Cristal.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.957
I've spoken to the FBI,

about you and the FBI?

20:43.825 --> 20:45.661

We've both been enamored with Blake,
and pulled into his orbit.

And we've both done illegal things for him
that can get us put away for decades.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.838
Blake wouldn't let that happen to me.
He'd protect me.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.548

Don't blame this all on your mother.

she hadn't been with Blake,

21:42.092 --> 21:43.552

I'd drug test him on the spot.

I'm from New Zealand.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.672
It's not like bands
from New Zealand roll off the tongue.

32:45.755 --> 32:46.798
Split Enz?

32:46.881 --> 32:49.384
I'm sure they were very popular
in your village.

32:49.467 --> 32:50.301
Sam.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.595
This private jet, the curated music,

32:52.679 --> 32:56.349
your overzealous attempts
to make me happy.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.476
-I must admit--
-You're sick of me?

32:58.559 --> 32:59.978
I'm having fun.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.522
Well, you deserve it.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.233
Let's take a selfie.

33:06.192 --> 33:07.735
To make everyone jealous.

33:08.361 --> 33:09.362
Ready?

33:09.445 --> 33:10.363
[cell phone beeps]

33:10.446 --> 33:13.616
Uh... On second thought,
live in the moment.

33:14.283 --> 33:16.619
You're a good friend. And a terrible liar.

33:24.794 --> 33:25.628
Miss Carrington?

33:27.797 --> 33:28.631
I see.

33:29.757 --> 33:31.968
-We'll be back as soon as possible.
-What?

33:32.051 --> 33:33.928
Sorry, Sam. Duty calls.

33:34.512 --> 33:35.847
Well, duty blows!

33:42.770 --> 33:43.855
[cell phone ringing]

33:46.190 --> 33:48.026
Look at what the cat's dragging out.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.903
I was feeling badly that I set that trap.

33:51.946 --> 33:53.740
Worse that you took the bait.

33:57.952 --> 33:58.786
Scotch.

34:00.038 --> 34:00.872
Senator.

34:01.956 --> 34:03.791
So glad you accepted my invitation.

34:04.584 --> 34:08.045
I felt I had to publicly show
support for your sports gambling,

34:08.129 --> 34:10.339
considering I was forced
to give my support.

34:10.422 --> 34:11.716
Yeah, about that.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.844
Seems there's been a breach in my camp.

34:15.428 --> 34:16.429
What kind of breach?

34:16.512 --> 34:18.181
The kind that involves the FBI.

34:19.098 --> 34:21.768
You bastard. You promised me.

34:21.851 --> 34:25.063
It's nothing to worry about,
as long as you keep your mouth shut.

34:25.938 --> 34:26.773
What do we do?

34:26.856 --> 34:29.108
Let's have a private chat.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.487
So we get our stories straight.

34:37.324 --> 34:40.244
So, your sick son welcomes you home
with open arms,

34:40.328 --> 34:42.371
and you go right for his open wallet.

34:42.705 --> 34:46.083
You may be Blake's sister,
but you remind me a lot more of Alexis.

34:46.167 --> 34:48.460
-Are you finished?
-No, but you are.

34:49.003 --> 34:51.422
-Check the trash, Monica.
-What kind of insult is that?

34:51.505 --> 34:53.257
Check the actual trash. Please.

35:00.181 --> 35:03.893
-You don't want my money?
-I want what I just watched.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.020
You two having each other's backs.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.523
Don't you worry about that. We're solid.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.358
[Dominique]
Oh, you were until I came back.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.445
I know I screwed up, and I'll have to live
with those consequences,

35:14.529 --> 35:17.865
but when I stepped out,
I created something good.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.034
I created a team.

35:20.743 --> 35:23.621
You two. And it would kill me
to destroy that.

35:25.289 --> 35:26.958
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.

35:30.670 --> 35:31.504
Wait.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.756
[Jeff] Why don't you stay?

35:35.091 --> 35:36.134
Please?

35:36.384 --> 35:38.094
I don't want to cause any trouble.

35:38.177 --> 35:39.971
What's family without trouble?

35:40.054 --> 35:44.142
I'm open to the idea of a trial period.
We'll see how it goes.

35:45.601 --> 35:48.813
I hope you can find a way
to love me again.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.566
I'm sure we will.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.278
I'm hoping we can find a way
to trust you again.

35:57.405 --> 36:00.616
The U.S. doesn't have
the best soccer players in the world yet.

36:01.117 --> 36:05.079
But I have a vision of the Carrington
Atlantix Soccer Academy.

36:05.621 --> 36:06.706
[clearing throat]

36:07.165 --> 36:09.125
-I need a minute.
-Are you serious?

36:09.208 --> 36:10.710
They're giving away free season tickets

36:10.793 --> 36:13.212
to whoever can score a goal
against Jimmy Carter!

36:13.296 --> 36:15.548
Yup, go, go, go!
I just came from there, it was fun.

36:15.923 --> 36:18.134
-This had better not be about Adam.
-Okay.

36:20.094 --> 36:22.471
Okay, but Daddy, he is not tired,
he's on drugs.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.140
Enough of this nonsense.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.057
I can prove it.

36:25.141 --> 36:25.975
Anders?

36:26.767 --> 36:28.561
I thought you were on your way
to the Maldives?

36:28.644 --> 36:30.188
You and me both, brother.

36:30.271 --> 36:34.775
Sir, I found this bottle of hydrocodone
in Master Adam's room.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.694
He prescribed this to Alexis.

36:36.777 --> 36:38.988
Yesterday. Even though
she's out of the country.

36:39.071 --> 36:43.201
And if you count the number of tablets,
you'll see he's taken quite a few.

36:43.284 --> 36:46.787
Isn't it like the story Adam told you?
About the woman who raised him?

36:46.871 --> 36:48.664
Why, yes it is, Liam. Good point.

36:48.748 --> 36:51.334
Only this time, they are for himself.

36:52.418 --> 36:53.836
Adam? Hey.

36:54.795 --> 36:57.048
What's up with these pills, huh?
Are you high?

36:57.131 --> 36:59.842
Hey, Adam, if you're too out of it,
you can just nod your head.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.681
No, I'm perfectly straight, Father.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.684
But I think my jealous sister's
been plotting against me.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.186
We came for this drama?

37:10.269 --> 37:12.188
What? Guys, I mean, he's clearly--

37:12.271 --> 37:15.733
Fallon pretended to be Mom yesterday.
You looked just like her, by the way,

37:15.816 --> 37:18.486
but I could tell
that wasn't my mother's fragrant scent.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.071
Just so I would write a prescription.

37:20.154 --> 37:23.282
And then she and Romeo van Romeo
over here picked up the pills,

37:23.366 --> 37:25.952
have been dosing me.
But they're not pain meds.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.536
They're salt pills.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.413
Is this true? Don't lie to me.

37:29.538 --> 37:33.751
Well, I mean, it's mostly--
Yeah, it's all true.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.254
You've done a lot of low things, Fallon.

37:36.712 --> 37:39.715
But this, on this day, is egregiously low.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.051
Yeah, and all to drive a wedge
between you, me, and Mom?

37:42.134 --> 37:43.928
It breaks my heart.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.639
And I pity this juvenile insecurity.

37:46.722 --> 37:49.475
Okay, well, you can save your pity,
psycho-boy.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.602
Your mommy issues are so disturbing,

37:51.686 --> 37:53.312
even Norman Bates would be creeped out.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.189
Don't you talk about me
and Mother, Fallon.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.275
Our connection is beautiful,
and sacred, and forever.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.068
Okay, well, then
I must be missing something,

37:59.151 --> 38:02.113
because the last time I checked,
your mommy dearest had to flee the country

38:02.196 --> 38:03.823
-just to get away from you.
-That's a lie.

38:03.906 --> 38:06.617
She had to get away from her crazy son
who made her change her face.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.745
-Stop it.
-Her crazy-ass deranged son!

38:09.829 --> 38:11.414
-Shut your mouth!
-Hey!

38:12.290 --> 38:13.124
Don't touch me.

38:13.916 --> 38:15.209
What?

38:21.757 --> 38:23.134
No! No!

38:24.176 --> 38:25.636
[both shouting]

38:29.473 --> 38:31.851
-That is unacceptable.
-But she pushed me first.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.728
Zero buts. You're fired.

38:42.653 --> 38:43.571
Ow.

38:48.492 --> 38:52.121
Ouch, looks like golden boy's
getting his golden ass spanked.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.956
-You sure you're okay?
-Hmm?

38:55.041 --> 38:57.043
Oh, yes. You're sweet to ask.

38:57.126 --> 39:00.087
I am fine. Although I hope you're not
too disappointed in me

39:00.171 --> 39:01.297
for taking the low road.

39:01.380 --> 39:04.050
Oh, excuse me, but you weren't exactly
slumming alone.

39:04.133 --> 39:07.178
That's true. You were equally,
deliciously despicable.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.349
But you know what? It's all worth it,

39:11.432 --> 39:14.560
because my creepster brother
has finally been put in his place.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.023
And next time you have an issue
with your sister, you handle it privately.

39:19.106 --> 39:22.109
We don't need the whole world seeing
how Carrington men handle our business.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.570
-I understand.
-I'm sorry I had to fire you.

39:24.653 --> 39:27.114
You still work for me, of course,
just discretely.

39:27.198 --> 39:27.990
Thank you.

39:28.074 --> 39:28.908
Hey.

39:30.618 --> 39:31.452
I love you.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.420
That's not healthy either.
Meditation's better.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.172
Hey, I was just checking to see
if you're--

39:43.255 --> 39:44.590
He's taking his meds?

39:44.673 --> 39:47.676
We're both on the same page, sweetie.
How nice is that.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.554
-I love this!
-This is everything I ever wanted.

39:51.138 --> 39:53.265
-[Cecil] Come on, Monica!
-[Jeff] Come on, Monny.

39:53.349 --> 39:54.934
-Get over here.
-[Cecil] Come on, girl.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.103
[cell phone buzzes]

39:57.186 --> 39:58.938
Oh, I just remembered.

39:59.021 --> 40:01.857
I bought you the most beautiful sweater,
and I'm going to go get it.

40:01.941 --> 40:02.942
I'll be right back.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.611
[Cecil] All right, so we have Monday...

40:06.570 --> 40:08.697
-Okay. What day is it?
-You're in trouble.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.368
Hi, babe! I only have a second.

40:13.786 --> 40:17.790
Just as I was reaching for the door
to leave, the phone rang.

40:17.873 --> 40:18.874
Loudly.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.460
Jeff and Monica came running.
It was perfect.

40:23.462 --> 40:24.880
How are the kids?

40:26.757 --> 40:29.927
Tell them Mommy misses them,
and I'll be there as soon as I can.

40:31.470 --> 40:32.304
<i>Ciao.</i>

40:35.349 --> 40:37.351
[Dominique cackles]

40:44.817 --> 40:46.610
-Cristal.
-Michael.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.028
I am surprised to see you.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.030
I thought you'd be halfway
to Australia by now.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.158
And I thought
you'd be in the middle of Mexico.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.910
-You should go.
-Cristal, it is not too late for you.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.496
-[Blake] It's too late for you.
-You're making a mistake.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.040
No. You made a mistake.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.085
Thinking that the love of my life
would turn her back on me.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.920
Cristal's much too smart for that.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.505
Clearly something you're not.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.424
I was just trying to help her
get away from you.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.342
Wish someone had done the same
for me years ago.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.344
Is that why you ratted me out to the FBI?

41:12.428 --> 41:14.847
No, they had me over
the whole Ada Stone mess,

41:14.930 --> 41:17.975
so I did what I had to do.
You would've done the same thing.

41:18.058 --> 41:20.811
No. I wouldn't have got caught
in the first place.

41:21.395 --> 41:22.730
FBI! Nobody moves!

41:22.813 --> 41:24.273
[Blake] Look at that, perfect timing!

41:24.356 --> 41:26.192
You should've disappeared
when you had a chance.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.402
I'm not going down. You are.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.989
Blake Carrington, you're under arrest
for blackmail and coercion.

41:32.072 --> 41:32.907
What's going on here?

41:32.990 --> 41:35.618
Oh, God, it's my confirmation party
all over again.

41:35.701 --> 41:37.953
You're making a mistake.
He's the one you're looking for.

41:38.037 --> 41:38.871
Ma'am, please.

41:38.954 --> 41:41.916
So, who would've thought
Cristal would run right to you?

41:41.999 --> 41:45.503
Oh, yeah, I would. It's a good thing
I had that senator wear a wire.

41:46.045 --> 41:47.588
So, who's the smart one here?

41:47.671 --> 41:48.631
Everybody, back up!

41:49.673 --> 41:51.926
You're gonna pay for this,
you son of a bitch!

41:53.093 --> 41:54.595
[buzzer buzzing]

41:54.678 --> 41:56.722
Too late, Blake. Time's up.

41:56.805 --> 41:57.723
You have the right...

41:57.806 --> 41:58.641
-Daddy!
-I'm okay.

41:58.724 --> 42:00.809
...anything you say
can be used against you.

42:01.227 --> 42:02.645
[in Spanish] This does not end here.
