WEBVTT

00:21.272 --> 00:24.776
There's no respect.
I couldn't even grab the cigarettes.

00:24.859 --> 00:29.781
I'm gonna shoot every fucking hostage
in the head. That's right.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.074
Who's doing this?

00:31.282 --> 00:33.952
Carrillo and Search Bloc,
I'm sure of it.

00:34.035 --> 00:38.206
- In the middle of our negotiations?
- Either Gaviria is trying to catch me...

00:42.919 --> 00:46.506
or Carrillo doesn't give a shit
about the negotiations.

00:47.716 --> 00:50.885
You know what we have to do, Pablo.
We have to close the deal fast...

00:50.969 --> 00:53.221
before they find us and kill us.

00:54.889 --> 00:58.643
Not before we build our own jail.

00:59.602 --> 01:04.274
And that fucking pussy president
will have to agree to that,

01:04.357 --> 01:07.235
even if I have to stick a bomb up his ass.

01:08.319 --> 01:11.239
It's so fucking cold.
ls there a jacket there for me?

01:11.322 --> 01:13.742
- Check it out, fag.
- What's up?

01:16.077 --> 01:19.372
It's a miniskirt with your name on it.

01:19.456 --> 01:21.666
- "Gustavo Gaviria."
- Give me that.

01:25.628 --> 01:27.589
All right, let's call the boys.

01:30.925 --> 01:34.804
And what about you?
Are you all right?

01:48.234 --> 01:50.195
<i>OK, boys, we're in the clear.</i>

01:50.278 --> 01:53.031
<i>Pick us up at El Mariano pass.</i>

02:07.921 --> 02:12.926
Search Bloc, we are registering the
latitude and longitude at a fixed point.

02:13.009 --> 02:15.595
<i>The subject appears
to have stopped moving.</i>

02:18.056 --> 02:19.849
You've gotta be shitting me.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.908
How nice to see
that you have made friends.

05:24.951 --> 05:27.912
Careful, son.
This woman is very clever.

05:27.996 --> 05:30.957
She can grab your gun
and shoot you in the head.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.583
My apologies, boss.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.639
How do you feel?

05:49.058 --> 05:51.310
As well as one might expect.

05:52.103 --> 05:55.106
I need you to record another tape for me.

05:56.649 --> 05:58.276
No.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.904
No, not until you free more hostages.

06:03.364 --> 06:07.076
Maruja is very ill.
Ricardo has an ulcer.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.954
I'm the only one you need to negotiate.

06:10.038 --> 06:13.416
Then why does the Colombian government
keep trying to capture me?

06:15.835 --> 06:17.086
Lookâ€œ.

06:18.921 --> 06:21.758
I admire your bravery very much.

06:21.841 --> 06:27.722
But Gaviria is a piece of shit, and,
with all due respect, so is your father.

06:27.805 --> 06:29.682
And what did you expect?

06:30.600 --> 06:32.602
To get into Congress like it was nothing?

06:33.770 --> 06:37.023
Without it mattering that you,
in fact, traffic drugs?

06:38.983 --> 06:40.943
I expected respect.

06:42.695 --> 06:46.616
You had respect
when you built homes for the poor.

06:47.950 --> 06:52.497
But when you didn't get that respect
from a herd of egocentric bureaucrats,

06:52.580 --> 06:54.332
you threw a tantrum.

06:57.585 --> 07:02.215
I was going to do marvelous things
for this country.

07:04.801 --> 07:09.180
If I have made myself into a monster,
like all of you say,

07:09.263 --> 07:13.017
that is the fault of people
like your father...

07:13.101 --> 07:15.978
and those politicians "of always."

07:17.438 --> 07:19.315
Those oligarchs and those people

07:19.398 --> 07:23.402
were never going to tolerate
that little paisa from Medellin

07:23.486 --> 07:29.325
who had more money
and was more intelligent than all of them.

07:30.952 --> 07:32.286
Yes.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.998
You would have done marvelous things.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.377
And that is the saddest part.

07:40.837 --> 07:46.050
<i>Mr. Escobar has promised
to free two more hostages.</i>

07:46.134 --> 07:51.430
<i>But in exchange, he has asked that you
continue negotiations with transparency.</i>

07:51.514 --> 07:56.310
<i>President Gaviria...
he knows what you are doing.</i>

07:56.394 --> 07:58.729
<i>He knows.</i>

07:58.813 --> 08:03.151
<i>If you insist on trying to capture him
with the help of the Americans...</i>

08:05.778 --> 08:07.405
<i>they're going to kill us all.</i>

08:11.909 --> 08:14.954
You are risking my daughter's life!

08:15.037 --> 08:18.499
No, Nydia. With all due respect,
we are not risking anyone's life.

08:18.583 --> 08:22.378
Our priority is the life of your daughter
and the lives of the rest of the hostages.

08:22.587 --> 08:26.090
But our priority
is also to capture Escobar.

08:26.299 --> 08:28.759
You cannot have both things at once.

08:28.843 --> 08:31.929
Negotiate with Escobar
while trying to capture him?

08:32.138 --> 08:34.640
Do you know what he is demanding?

08:36.350 --> 08:40.980
That we call a constitutional referendum
to abolish extradition.

08:41.189 --> 08:46.360
That he only plead guilty
to having trafficked drugs one time.

08:46.444 --> 08:49.989
And worst of all,
he wants to build his own jail

08:50.072 --> 08:53.451
and have his own guards
to watch over him.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.912
This is a deal with the devil.

08:56.120 --> 09:00.458
You are the president of a country
that became a living hell some time ago.

09:00.666 --> 09:03.878
With whom else did you expect
to be making a deal?

09:22.647 --> 09:24.273
Hello. It's Gorilla.

09:33.908 --> 09:36.452
Forgive me, Gorilla,
I don't feel well.

09:39.372 --> 09:40.748
Miss Diana...

09:41.999 --> 09:44.585
why are you so unpleasant with the boss?

09:46.420 --> 09:49.382
You are loyal like a sheep,
aren't you?

09:50.925 --> 09:57.348
That man is your kidnapper... and mine,
and that of the whole nation.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.016
Here, you go first.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.260
Hide in here, quickly!

11:36.572 --> 11:37.782
Mr. President!

11:38.657 --> 11:40.326
You killed my daughter.

11:41.660 --> 11:42.828
Let her pass.

11:43.037 --> 11:44.538
Wait...

11:46.332 --> 11:49.835
If you had accepted his terms,
my daughter would still be alive!

11:52.922 --> 11:55.257
Give him whatever he wants.

11:55.341 --> 11:59.011
Don't let others go through the suffering
we've had to endure.

11:59.095 --> 12:01.639
Mr. President... we need to leave.

12:08.354 --> 12:10.356
God be with you, Nydia.

12:28.958 --> 12:30.960
There's something
I want to make very clear.

12:31.043 --> 12:36.090
You are not to blame for Diana's death.
OK? That has to be clear.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.553
Escobar has the resources
for this to go on forever.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.388
Yes, and so do we.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.098
We are the state.

12:44.181 --> 12:48.018
We are going to fight, do whatever we have
to do, and we are going to finish him.

12:48.102 --> 12:50.688
We have options.

12:50.771 --> 12:54.650
For instance, why don't we allow
the American military to come in?

12:54.733 --> 12:58.571
I know-- We don't like it.
I personally don't like it.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.449
But if it's a specific, clear mission--

13:01.532 --> 13:02.741
- No.
- Something covert.

13:02.825 --> 13:03.951
No!

13:08.247 --> 13:10.749
It's time to end all of this.

13:15.463 --> 13:17.465
Give Escobar what he wants.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.219
Let's go.

14:26.951 --> 14:31.247
Well... at this time,
our friend, Fernando,

14:31.330 --> 14:34.083
is going to tell us a little something.

14:36.210 --> 14:40.339
The Colombian government is going
to allow Pablo to turn himself in,

14:40.422 --> 14:46.387
accepting only one simple charge:
drug trafficking.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.597
And...

14:48.681 --> 14:50.975
they are going to let him build a jail

14:51.058 --> 14:57.022
which the police
cannot be within three kilometers of.

14:57.106 --> 15:00.526
At last...
we have liberated ourselves from tyranny!

15:00.609 --> 15:02.987
Long live Colombia, motherfuckers.

15:04.697 --> 15:06.156
Fernando...

15:08.117 --> 15:10.786
thank you very much.

15:10.869 --> 15:16.792
And do you know when Congress
is going to vote to abolish extradition?

15:16.875 --> 15:20.713
Yes, it's--
It's a matter of... of weeks.

15:20.796 --> 15:24.592
And at that time, you will be able
to turn yourself over to the authorities.

15:24.675 --> 15:28.178
It pleases me very much to finish my work
with you with such a great victory.

15:28.262 --> 15:32.433
No, brother. Now is when I am going
to need your services the most.

15:36.687 --> 15:39.189
- How-- How's that?
- Fernando...

15:40.566 --> 15:46.864
now it's time for us to find legal means
to reduce my sentence even more.

15:50.743 --> 15:52.161
Right?

16:14.016 --> 16:16.560
And what does this mean for us, huh?

16:16.644 --> 16:22.524
It means, my love...
that now I have a jail.

16:25.235 --> 16:29.823
And for you,
visiting days will be...

16:30.866 --> 16:32.534
every day.

16:33.619 --> 16:36.205
- I'm serious, Pablo.
- So am I.

16:38.415 --> 16:41.293
The problem, Pablo, is that...

16:41.377 --> 16:44.797
now that you have admitted
to trafficking in narcotics,

16:44.880 --> 16:48.425
my image as a journalist
cannot be associated with yours.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.642
So then...

16:59.311 --> 17:06.026
now you think I am going to damage your
credibility as a journalist... is that it?

17:07.986 --> 17:10.280
You understand what I'm saying.

17:10.364 --> 17:13.325
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course I do.

17:15.327 --> 17:20.958
I think that it's time for me...

17:21.041 --> 17:23.752
to set you free, so that...

17:23.836 --> 17:27.005
you can find a boyfriend
who's honest...

17:28.173 --> 17:33.345
so that you can get a little house,
have little kids,

17:33.429 --> 17:35.764
- little dogs...
- Don't joke around, Pablo.

17:35.848 --> 17:37.808
No, I'm not joking.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.688
I just want you to know...

17:43.731 --> 17:46.191
that you, Valeria...

17:47.317 --> 17:50.738
are a bandit, just like me.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.953
So don't come to me with bullshit.

18:13.844 --> 18:16.889
Looks like you got away with it,
eh, asshole?

18:25.189 --> 18:27.691
Shit, I'd thought you'd gone crazy.

18:35.073 --> 18:40.120
Geniuses...
are always branded as crazy.

18:40.204 --> 18:43.040
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

18:48.462 --> 18:51.131
- The Ochoas...
- The Ochoas what?

18:52.299 --> 18:55.135
You can bet
they're going to be pissed off.

18:55.219 --> 18:57.095
Because of the treaty?

18:58.222 --> 19:01.141
Or because you're fucking their sister?

19:14.071 --> 19:16.657
That was a stupid mistake, Gustavo.

19:23.247 --> 19:25.874
Let's hope they don't
make you pay for it later.

20:36.111 --> 20:38.447
The soccer field will be over here.

20:40.490 --> 20:44.661
Here, I want to have
a little doll house for Manuela,

20:44.745 --> 20:50.167
and downstairs,
a bar with a Jacuzzi for the guys.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.794
My family will live in a house
down the hill.

20:53.003 --> 20:57.049
I'm going to install a telescope
so I can look at them whenever I want.

20:57.257 --> 21:00.093
Yeah, right. More like
you can look at other girls' asses.

21:00.177 --> 21:05.057
No. The family, the family.
To see my kids.

21:06.016 --> 21:10.354
- What can we do to help you, Pablo?
- Well...

21:10.437 --> 21:13.565
while we're in prison,
Gustavo and me,

21:13.649 --> 21:19.488
I will count on you, Moncada, and you,
Galeano, to oversee operations.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.824
Thank you, Pablo.

21:22.908 --> 21:28.080
We're privileged to be given
that responsibility. You can count on us.

21:28.163 --> 21:31.875
We've already spoken about the operational
plan and everything's clear, right?

21:31.959 --> 21:34.086
Yes. We won't let you down, Pablo.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.421
Did you tell them about the tax?

21:37.631 --> 21:39.883
- No, I didn't.
- The tax?

21:39.967 --> 21:41.927
What tax is this?

21:43.637 --> 21:46.431
Who paid for the war we fought?

21:46.640 --> 21:48.016
You.

21:50.060 --> 21:53.146
- You, Don Pablo.
- That's right.

21:54.564 --> 21:57.067
We have peace now.

21:57.150 --> 22:00.821
You're going to directly
benefit from that.

22:01.822 --> 22:07.202
It's only fair that you contribute
to the legal and security costs

22:07.285 --> 22:10.038
that Gustavo and I will face behind bars.

22:10.956 --> 22:13.750
And about how much will that be?

22:13.834 --> 22:18.463
We agreed to what,
$200,000 a month, right?

22:18.672 --> 22:20.716
Yes, 200 grand.

22:20.799 --> 22:23.051
200 grand?

22:23.135 --> 22:27.055
That's a lot of money, brother.
A lot of money.

22:27.139 --> 22:29.016
But consider it done.

22:29.099 --> 22:33.395
And again... thank you
very much for this responsibility,

22:33.603 --> 22:35.981
- and for considering us.
- All right, then.

22:48.035 --> 22:51.496
Do you think that was a smart move, Pablo?

22:51.580 --> 22:55.459
Why should I let them
reap the fruits of our labor

22:55.542 --> 22:58.378
without compensating us for it, Gustavo?

23:00.380 --> 23:02.132
I agree with you.

23:03.425 --> 23:07.554
But right now, we really
need those two fags to be loyal.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.807
And what?
You don't think I inspire loyalty?

23:11.016 --> 23:14.269
My loyalty?
Yes, you know you have it.

23:14.352 --> 23:16.480
But I'm not sure about everyone else's.

23:17.731 --> 23:21.193
You know, the thing is, Pablo...
you won.

23:21.276 --> 23:23.570
There's no arguing that.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.489
But you gave in.

23:25.572 --> 23:29.159
And there are people
who will see that as weakness.

23:29.242 --> 23:34.164
We've gotta keep our enemies close,
now more than ever.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.128
Thank you.

23:42.005 --> 23:45.133
It's great to see you again, Valeria.

23:46.176 --> 23:49.805
Likewise, Pacho.
I'm very happy to see you.

23:49.888 --> 23:54.267
Although I must say...
it was a little unexpected.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.896
We are worried about you.

23:58.730 --> 24:02.067
And... why are "we" worried?

24:02.275 --> 24:05.487
Pablo's cutting a deal
with the government.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.531
He's going to have
to admit to certain things.

24:07.739 --> 24:11.993
Things that may damage
your reputation by association.

24:14.496 --> 24:19.751
If I'm good at anything,
it's protecting my reputation.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.921
Listen, this time it's different.

24:24.089 --> 24:29.386
Look... you helped create
that "Robin Hood Paisa" bullshit.

24:29.594 --> 24:34.057
And when it all goes to shit, you'll have
to take responsibility for that.

24:34.141 --> 24:37.018
Maybe he tricked me, too.
Like the rest of the world.

24:37.227 --> 24:39.187
You have enemies, see?

24:39.271 --> 24:41.148
They're not gonna
let you get away with it.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.525
Look, Valeria...

24:44.442 --> 24:50.031
we have a lot of connections in New York,
a strong presence, you could say.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.326
You should go there,
at least for a little while.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.786
And leave Colombia.

24:54.995 --> 24:58.039
There are a million Colombians there.

24:58.123 --> 25:00.876
A new audience.

25:00.959 --> 25:04.004
And they don't care if you shared your bed
with a monster or not.

25:07.841 --> 25:10.218
Just for a while.

25:10.302 --> 25:13.388
When this is all over, you'll be able to
come back here with your head held high.

25:13.597 --> 25:15.557
I guarantee it.

25:16.558 --> 25:21.563
And not only that, you'll have earned
a brand-new audience in the United States.

25:23.732 --> 25:27.527
- Betrayal is not my style.
- What betrayal?

25:28.612 --> 25:30.363
And what would you be betraying?

25:31.698 --> 25:33.658
Your role as his mistress?

25:34.618 --> 25:40.916
You remain loyal to a man who has never
thought you good enough to be his wife.

25:40.999 --> 25:43.585
His wife? Me?

25:43.668 --> 25:46.546
No,no,no,
you're very much mistaken, my dear.

25:46.630 --> 25:48.381
The last thing I want
is to be married to him.

25:49.507 --> 25:52.677
Besides...
do you think I'd want to be his wife?

25:55.263 --> 25:59.184
Do you think I want to be locked up,
waiting all day at the Monaco building,

25:59.267 --> 26:01.061
while he's outwith...

26:03.271 --> 26:04.731
with me?

26:06.524 --> 26:07.859
No.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.987
That's too boring.

26:20.038 --> 26:21.998
I missed you so much.

26:23.166 --> 26:24.834
I missed you, too.

26:34.970 --> 26:36.888
No, it was terrible.

26:37.806 --> 26:39.391
It was terrible.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.185
Every day in a different house...

26:43.937 --> 26:46.022
worried about you...

26:47.524 --> 26:49.109
the kids...

26:54.948 --> 26:56.491
The truth is...

26:59.119 --> 27:01.997
it's very good to be home.

27:03.707 --> 27:06.626
- You look happy.
- Of course.

27:09.879 --> 27:11.923
That time has passed.

27:13.300 --> 27:17.804
It's the happiest face I've ever seen
on a man about to go to jail.

27:23.977 --> 27:26.313
The kids!
The kids, Pablo!

27:26.396 --> 27:27.772
- The kids!
- No, Tata!

27:27.856 --> 27:29.983
- I have to go to them!
- Stay here!

27:30.066 --> 27:32.610
- My children!
- Stay here!

27:32.694 --> 27:34.863
I'll go get them. Stay here.

27:36.614 --> 27:38.325
Juan Pablo!

27:40.160 --> 27:41.828
Juan Pablo!

27:41.911 --> 27:43.788
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

27:43.872 --> 27:45.165
Come on.

27:49.627 --> 27:52.839
Go to your mother.
Go to your mother.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.635
Come on, come on.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.556
Don't worry, cousin.

28:45.809 --> 28:47.977
We're going to kill them all.

29:15.630 --> 29:16.756
Hello?

29:16.840 --> 29:20.385
<i>Valeria, there was an attempted hit
at the Monaco building.</i>

29:20.468 --> 29:25.306
- <i>Just now?</i>
- <i>Yes,</i> a <i>few minutes ago. A car bomb.</i>

29:25.390 --> 29:28.726
- Who <i>was inside?</i>
<i>- We don't know.</i>

29:29.978 --> 29:31.938
What other information do you have?

29:32.021 --> 29:34.983
<i>That's all the information
we have right now.</i>

29:35.066 --> 29:36.818
OK, thanks.

30:01.634 --> 30:03.803
He always takes her to the same motel.

30:07.807 --> 30:09.976
- Marina.
- Where are you going?

30:11.478 --> 30:13.480
I'm going to the city.

30:13.563 --> 30:15.773
I have to get out of this prison.

30:16.774 --> 30:19.569
- Come here, Marina.
- Yes?

30:23.490 --> 30:25.158
Have a good time.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.076
Be safe.

30:28.036 --> 30:29.496
Thanks.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.342
You know what he's going to do, right?

30:42.425 --> 30:44.886
He's going to continue conducting
his business behind those walls

30:44.969 --> 30:48.473
that are protected
by the Colombian government.

30:48.556 --> 30:51.434
We should give him credit.
The man is a genius.

30:51.518 --> 30:55.563
Well... all the more reason
that we should negotiate our surrender.

30:55.772 --> 30:59.108
But you know that Pablo
took it upon himself to close that door.

30:59.192 --> 31:01.319
So we need to take advantage
of your political contacts,

31:01.402 --> 31:03.988
especially General Jaramillo.

31:04.822 --> 31:06.658
Can you talk to him for us?

31:06.741 --> 31:09.160
Yes, of course.

31:09.244 --> 31:11.829
But I don't think it will be enough.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.206
What are you saying?

31:13.289 --> 31:16.459
That you're going
to have to offer something more,

31:16.543 --> 31:20.296
something that interests them enough
to make a deal with you.

31:22.257 --> 31:23.841
Gustavo Gaviria.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.637
He is the key to Pablo's business.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.014
If that son of a bitch goes down,
the whole empire goes down.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.769
Indeed, that could work.

31:36.229 --> 31:37.689
That could work.

32:05.925 --> 32:06.968
Follow me.

32:47.383 --> 32:49.135
Kiss me.

33:07.445 --> 33:09.739
- You look pretty, baby.
- Yeah, sure.

33:09.822 --> 33:12.867
What I mean is
you've always looked pretty.

33:30.718 --> 33:32.345
What's happening?

33:33.304 --> 33:34.847
Nothing.

33:34.931 --> 33:38.768
Nothing is happening here.
Isn't that right, Colonel Carrillo?

33:38.851 --> 33:40.728
That's up to you.

33:44.107 --> 33:47.110
- Say goodbye.
- No.

33:47.193 --> 33:49.487
No, no, no.
Gustavo, look at me.

33:49.570 --> 33:51.322
Does your family know where you are?

33:51.406 --> 33:53.116
- Gustavo!
- Calm down, Marina.

33:56.536 --> 34:00.373
You're making a big mistake, Carrillo.

34:01.666 --> 34:05.545
We're already in negotiations
with the government.

34:05.628 --> 34:08.965
- You have no reason to be doing this.
- You're right.

34:10.591 --> 34:12.468
That's why I'm not here.

34:15.304 --> 34:17.473
Then what the fuck do you want?

34:19.225 --> 34:21.269
Don't act stupid.

34:22.228 --> 34:26.399
Give me your cousin...
and I'll let you live.

34:33.406 --> 34:34.866
All right.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.953
Kill me, then, motherfucker.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.998
I won't do that myself.

34:43.416 --> 34:48.129
But I want to introduce you to some people
who would love to do it for me.

34:49.046 --> 34:52.300
This guy? This is Lastia.

34:54.010 --> 34:59.223
His sister died in a bookstore in BogotÃ¡
in a bombing you coordinated.

34:59.307 --> 35:01.350
She was 17 years old.

35:02.393 --> 35:04.270
And this guy here...

35:07.774 --> 35:09.650
this is Trujillo.

35:11.778 --> 35:16.324
You killed his father
and his brother for being cops.

35:18.451 --> 35:21.370
- That has nothing to do with me.
- No?

35:22.955 --> 35:28.461
You know...
if you support evil, you are evil.

35:29.712 --> 35:31.339
Look at them.

35:31.547 --> 35:33.925
I just want you to look at their faces.

35:34.133 --> 35:37.261
A few of the victims
you've left in your wake.

35:38.679 --> 35:40.014
Tell me...

35:40.932 --> 35:45.478
have you ever felt
the swift vengeance of justice?

35:49.857 --> 35:52.235
Give me your cousin...

35:52.318 --> 35:55.988
or I'll let these men show you
that vengeance with their fists.

36:09.252 --> 36:13.422
Do it, then...
you sons of bitches.

36:13.631 --> 36:15.216
OK, then.

36:17.844 --> 36:22.849
We'll see how you feel...
after ten minutes.

36:24.141 --> 36:25.518
Do it.

36:51.794 --> 36:54.255
Tell me where your cousin is.

36:55.172 --> 36:57.842
It doesn't have to end like this.

37:17.904 --> 37:20.114
Tell me where your cousin is.

37:26.454 --> 37:27.872
We...

37:28.831 --> 37:33.920
are bandits...
not snitches, motherfucker.

37:51.187 --> 37:55.107
You're--
You're all gonna die, motherfuckers!

37:55.191 --> 37:57.985
You're all dead, motherfuckers!

37:58.069 --> 38:00.696
You're all dead, motherfuckers!

38:00.780 --> 38:06.744
You, your families,
your wives are all dead, motherfuckers!

38:06.827 --> 38:08.037
You're all dead!

38:11.916 --> 38:15.044
Dump his body on the road to Sabaneta.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.755
Colonel, they're going
to make us pay for this.

38:19.173 --> 38:24.011
Report his death as a result
of a shoot-out with the police.

38:24.095 --> 38:26.764
Make sure you report that he fired first.

38:26.973 --> 38:28.933
But Colonel, he's all beat up.

38:35.731 --> 38:37.608
That work for you?

38:48.786 --> 38:55.584
There is nothing... more beautiful
and more important in my life than this.

38:57.044 --> 39:00.756
We're all here together... united.

39:03.551 --> 39:07.471
Now let's eat and enjoy
this marvelous food.

39:09.265 --> 39:13.394
- Wait, wait.
- Oh, yeah, the beets.

39:14.729 --> 39:15.855
Boss?

39:17.440 --> 39:20.192
Hello, son. Have a seat.

39:20.276 --> 39:23.237
- Sit down--
- Boss, I don't know how to say this.

39:26.157 --> 39:27.575
Tell me like a man.

39:28.743 --> 39:30.745
- Gustavo is dead.
- What?

39:34.623 --> 39:37.418
They found his body on the outskirts
of Sabaneta, badly beaten.

39:37.501 --> 39:39.420
How's that?

39:39.628 --> 39:41.047
They also shot him, boss.

39:41.255 --> 39:44.258
No, no!
How dare you come to my house saying that!

39:44.467 --> 39:47.470
How dare you!
Leave! Get out of my house!

39:47.553 --> 39:51.265
You... you are leaving right now!
Get out of my house! Go on!

39:51.348 --> 39:54.935
No! Gustavo, no. Pablo...
Go on! Get out of here!

39:55.019 --> 39:58.814
It's OK.
Everything's going to be fine.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.827
Are you sure about this?

40:12.870 --> 40:13.913
Yes, boss.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.961
I want you to take him
to the funeral home...

40:23.089 --> 40:26.133
and guard his body the entire time
until it's buried.

40:27.259 --> 40:28.928
- All right.
- Go on.

40:40.356 --> 40:42.316
How are you doing, son?

41:19.395 --> 41:21.897
I'm going to miss him so much, Mama.

41:27.111 --> 41:28.529
When...

41:30.739 --> 41:37.746
you were nine... or ten...
do you remember?

41:37.830 --> 41:41.959
How you would
ride around on your bicycles.

41:45.588 --> 41:49.175
You'd go up into the mountains
and just disappear.

41:49.258 --> 41:53.095
The whole day would go by...

41:57.766 --> 41:59.935
And we would call you...

42:01.187 --> 42:06.066
We seemed crazy,
yelling for you all over the place...

42:08.861 --> 42:11.739
until finally you would appear.

42:13.157 --> 42:15.159
Oh, my God.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.370
"Where were you?"

42:19.205 --> 42:22.666
"Where have you been, son?"
I would yell out.

42:24.168 --> 42:26.754
"In the mountains, Mama."

42:27.838 --> 42:34.345
"Higher than the clouds, Auntie,"
Gustavo would say, laughing.

42:41.518 --> 42:43.103
He...

42:43.187 --> 42:45.773
He always wanted to go farther.

42:48.817 --> 42:51.153
He always did.

42:51.237 --> 42:53.197
But with you.

42:54.615 --> 42:56.700
Only with you.

43:01.622 --> 43:04.583
I didn't think it would end this way.

43:38.742 --> 43:40.577
Good afternoon.

43:43.539 --> 43:44.665
Boss?

43:44.873 --> 43:48.335
Someone came all the way out here
to see you.

43:51.839 --> 43:53.674
Miss Valeria.

44:07.271 --> 44:10.149
Good day, ma'am. Pablo.

44:11.025 --> 44:12.526
What's she doing here?

44:12.609 --> 44:15.529
I'm here only because
I have important information.

44:15.612 --> 44:17.072
I hope it's very important.

44:17.281 --> 44:19.742
It's about Gustavo.

44:21.076 --> 44:22.703
Tell us, then.

44:22.911 --> 44:27.458
I've been told the Ochoa brothers
have been seen in Cali.

44:27.541 --> 44:30.711
They are the ones
who turned Gustavo over,

44:30.794 --> 44:34.465
in exchange for the cartel helping them
seal a deal with the government.

44:34.548 --> 44:35.883
How do you know that?

44:36.091 --> 44:38.552
You know me, Pablo.

44:39.553 --> 44:41.305
I have my sources.

44:50.314 --> 44:52.649
Who in Cali?

44:55.319 --> 44:56.570
Pacho Herrera.

45:36.652 --> 45:38.987
"Will you hide yourself forever, Lord?

45:40.197 --> 45:43.075
Will your wrath burn like fire?

45:43.158 --> 45:46.203
<i>Remember how fleeting is my life,</i>

45:46.286 --> 45:50.916
<i>for what futility
you have created the children of men."</i>

46:39.715 --> 46:42.426
<i>As you know, I come on behalf
of President CÃ©sar Gaviria,</i>

46:42.509 --> 46:43.677
<i>and the Colombian government.</i>

46:43.886 --> 46:48.390
This is the offer of our terms
for your surrender.

47:04.281 --> 47:06.200
All right, then.

47:08.702 --> 47:10.496
Let me hand over my gun.

47:14.416 --> 47:17.544
- You won.
- We both did.

47:19.046 --> 47:22.007
Now Gaviria can announce
that Pablo Escobar has turned himself in.

47:24.593 --> 47:26.386
Except that's not so true.

47:26.470 --> 47:28.722
You and I know it's a huge lie.

47:31.850 --> 47:38.649
Lies are necessary... when the truth
is too difficult to believe. Right?

48:42.296 --> 48:45.090
<i>So, Lagarto...
are we gonna party tonight or what?</i>

48:48.760 --> 48:50.721
La Dispensaria.

49:12.367 --> 49:13.952
All right.
