NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:04.212 --> 00:06.923
No, don't kill me! Don't kill me, please!

00:07.007 --> 00:10.093
Six of them in two cars got $1.6 million.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.386
What's your lawyer's name?

00:11.970 --> 00:13.722
MAN: Political solidarity aside.

00:14.764 --> 00:15.682
It's over.

00:15.765 --> 00:18.810
-What about Frank Jr.?
-He wants to trade me in on a new mother.

00:18.893 --> 00:21.896
-(speaks foreign language)
-(gunshot)

00:22.564 --> 00:23.773
Stop! Please!

00:23.857 --> 00:25.316
This is your final warning.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.779
WOMAN (on P.A.):<i> Dr. Rogers, 1742.</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:30.947
<i>-Dr. Rogers...</i>
-(sobbing)

00:32.949 --> 00:35.535
(chattering)

00:35.618 --> 00:38.079
ESTERHAUS: Item 16, stakeouts.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.418
Could we please curtail
the aerobatic displays?

00:44.419 --> 00:47.088
And I trust who was ever paid
to distribute these flyers

00:47.172 --> 00:49.549
from Gung Ho Chinese Takeout

00:49.632 --> 00:53.595
will show an equal zeal in collecting
and clearing them from the room.

00:53.678 --> 00:54.637
MAN: Heard you, man.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.556
Item 16, stakeouts.

00:57.098 --> 01:00.435
Continuing, Detectives Cooley and Koester,
Lucky Strike Bowling Lanes.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.271
Resumed, Oshei and Baird,
Ramirez Check Cash.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.774
Beginning today,
Fulton Game Arcade, Belker.

01:05.857 --> 01:08.735
Tataglia and Dorsey stand backup.

01:08.985 --> 01:12.822
Item last. You've no doubt heard
of the unfortunate events

01:12.906 --> 01:18.369
culminating in the arrest the night
before last of Officer John Balch.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.206
(chuckling) With regard to Officer Balch's
alleged assault

01:21.289 --> 01:25.376
on repossession agent Joseph Imperiale

01:25.668 --> 01:29.506
whilst said agent sought to depart
Officer Balch's driveway

01:29.589 --> 01:31.758
with Officer Balch's Chrysler LeBaron,

01:31.966 --> 01:34.636
payments on said vehicle
being several months in arrears.

01:34.719 --> 01:35.804
(laughter)

01:35.887 --> 01:39.891
I've been asked to read this open letter
from Walter Hogarth,

01:39.974 --> 01:41.935
President of the Patrolmen's Credit Union.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.688
"No one is more acutely aware
of the many claims January makes

01:45.772 --> 01:48.900
on the patrolman's depleted purse
than is your credit union."

01:48.983 --> 01:50.652
-(groaning)
-"And your credit union is subject

01:50.735 --> 01:52.070
"to the same strains and drains.

01:52.153 --> 01:56.074
"Your credit union is no more than
the aggregate of its members' finances.

01:56.157 --> 01:58.660
"And your credit union
cannot allow its authorized agents

01:58.743 --> 02:01.996
to be assaulted with crowbars
and tire chains..."

02:02.080 --> 02:03.206
(laughter)

02:03.289 --> 02:06.126
"...in the performance
of their assigned responsibilities,

02:06.501 --> 02:09.003
however unpleasant these may be."

02:09.838 --> 02:12.465
People, there's a kernel of truth in that.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.843
Let's keep in mind that
we only buy more trouble,

02:14.926 --> 02:16.761
and in January, that's all we can afford,

02:16.845 --> 02:20.682
when we wreak vengeance
on the bearer of bad tidings.

02:20.765 --> 02:25.687
Having said which, I allow myself
the, uh, speculation

02:26.020 --> 02:28.815
-that if there's justice in the universe,
-(chuckles)

02:28.898 --> 02:34.779
...the deity has reserved a special circle
in hell for the repo man.

02:34.863 --> 02:38.533
(cheering, whistling)

02:38.616 --> 02:40.410
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.038
And let's be careful out there.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.085
(chattering)

02:51.754 --> 02:52.630
I'll catch you in a minute.

02:52.714 --> 02:57.302
Oh, it's the kind of pain, Frank,
that makes a man want to break formation

02:57.385 --> 03:01.598
and lay waste to whole villages
of undesirables.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.932
Why don't you have it taken care of,
Howard?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.350
Wouldn't I like to!

03:04.434 --> 03:07.562
-My man can't see me until 3:15.
-Hey, Lieutenant.

03:08.229 --> 03:11.691
I'll tell you what.
Try these guys right here, okay?

03:11.941 --> 03:13.943
Four dentists, no waiting.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.070
-Really?
-Here.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.490
And, uh, they're not too stingy
with the laughing gas either.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.785
Ma, I sent the check.

03:24.704 --> 03:25.872
Yes, I did.

03:27.457 --> 03:31.961
Well, I-- I, uh, I mailed it on Tuesday,
so they should probably have it by now.

03:34.255 --> 03:37.258
Look, I gotta be on stakeout
in 20 minutes. I can't talk...

03:38.801 --> 03:40.845
Ma, please, you gotta calm down!

03:42.680 --> 03:44.140
Yes, I will call them.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.477
As soon as I hang up with you.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.523
Listen to me now.
I don't care what they said!

03:52.607 --> 03:55.568
They will not put his bed
out on the street! I promise you that.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.531
Look, I gotta go right now.
I love you and don't worry. Goodbye.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.082
(sighs)

04:13.962 --> 04:15.713
-Something wrong, Detective?
-No.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.098
I got 102 bucks in my checking account,

04:26.724 --> 04:29.269
and I owe my old man's nursing home 300.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.646
They keep hawking my mother for the money.

04:31.729 --> 04:35.066
They keep telling her they're gonna throw
him out on the street if we don't pay up.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.988
I... I don't know what I'm gonna do.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.201
Can I float you a loan?

04:46.661 --> 04:49.122
-Oh, no.
-No, I insist. (chuckles)

04:49.831 --> 04:51.582
You just pay it back when you can.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.629
-Oh!
-What's the matter?

04:56.713 --> 05:00.717
Oh, a little oral discomfort here, Mick.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.428
-You need a good dentist?
-No, it's all right. I got one.

05:05.013 --> 05:05.847
There you are.

05:07.515 --> 05:08.933
Thank you very much.

05:11.227 --> 05:14.564
(sighs) Well, it's January. Say no more.

05:15.857 --> 05:19.569
Did you or did you not say, "Meet you
at The Brakers for breakfast," huh?

05:19.652 --> 05:22.030
I told you, man. My car wouldn't start.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.906
Car wouldn't start.
Then call on the telephone.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.326
Well, I tried to call, too,
and your line was busy.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.162
-Till 5:30 in the morning, Joe?
-Yeah.

05:29.245 --> 05:32.290
-Forget about it.
-Hey, hey, Luce. Come on.

05:32.373 --> 05:35.376
Wait a second. I am not
one of your bimbos. Get that straight.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.627
And, besides, it's the morning

05:36.711 --> 05:37.837
-of my birthday.
-I know.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.839
HILL:
Hey, did I hear someone say birthday?

05:39.922 --> 05:42.258
-Uh, no, you did not.
-Hey, big girl, isn't this the time

05:42.342 --> 05:44.844
they celebrate your natal event
about this time of year?

05:44.927 --> 05:47.597
No, little guy, it is not. If you blow
the whistle, Renko, I mean it--

05:47.680 --> 05:49.640
-Excuse me, Lucy?
-Yes?

05:49.724 --> 05:52.685
Would you come with me?
I have a little surprise for you.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.480
-A surprise?
-Yeah, just have a seat.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.364
(disco music plays)

06:04.447 --> 06:07.825
MAN: Yeah! Be nice!

06:08.034 --> 06:09.744
(hooting)

06:10.745 --> 06:13.081
MAN: Oh, yeah!

06:15.249 --> 06:16.918
-MEN: Oh!
-(zipper unzipping)

06:18.586 --> 06:20.254
(cheering)

06:22.048 --> 06:24.384
What kind of a person
would do something like that?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.052
HILL: Uh-oh, there goes the gun.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.140
(hooting continues)

06:37.397 --> 06:39.273
WASHINGTON: Uh-oh. Here he comes now!

06:42.068 --> 06:42.902
(ripping)

06:47.073 --> 06:49.158
(hooting continues)

06:49.242 --> 06:51.119
(cheering)

06:56.499 --> 06:58.751
-This your idea?
-Yeah, you like it?

07:00.461 --> 07:01.295
(grunts)

07:01.629 --> 07:03.923
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

07:04.298 --> 07:06.008
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

07:06.092 --> 07:09.887
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

(sirens wailing)

08:29.675 --> 08:31.719
(sirens wailing)

08:33.721 --> 08:35.890
BELKER: These kids give you any idea
when they might show up?

08:35.973 --> 08:37.558
No, no. They just said I'd be sorry.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.227
All right,
what time were they in here yesterday?

08:39.310 --> 08:42.813
About noon. I guess you gotta
admire their initiative, huh?

08:43.022 --> 08:45.066
-What for? Running a shakedown?
-No, no.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.777
Most of these kids, when they run out
of money, they just panhandle.

08:47.860 --> 08:51.781
But, see, I'm already payin' protection.
I've got a maintenance contract.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.116
Yeah, three gross of towels a week.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.493
I don't even have a sink.

08:56.118 --> 08:57.662
Well, after we straighten out this,

08:57.745 --> 09:00.206
maybe you ought to contact
our Organized Crime Division.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.376
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Be sure you leave me the number, huh?

09:04.210 --> 09:06.462
Hey, Belker! Come on in here with us.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.090
Uh, no, thank you. You guys go ahead.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.716
-Aw, come on.
-Come on, Mick. Hurry.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.261
Come on. We're havin' fun. We can fit.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.346
-All right.
-TATAGLIA: We're on the light. Come on.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.724
DORSEY: All right. Group shot. Group shot.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.310
-DORSEY: Okay, Robin, you sit on my lap.
-TATAGLIA: All right.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.854
DORSEY: And when the light flashes,
everybody say, "cheese."

09:23.938 --> 09:25.940
TATAGLIA: No, no.
Don't say cheese, say "Parcheesi."

09:26.023 --> 09:27.400
-DORSEY: There's the light.
-TATAGLIA: One, two, three.

09:27.483 --> 09:30.736
Parcheesi! (laughing)

09:31.737 --> 09:35.199
You know how Houdini died? Getting hit
in the stomach when he wasn't ready.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.202
Yeah. Well, maybe you should start working
on your disappearing act.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.413
You know, I can't believe it.
You can't take a joke.

09:40.496 --> 09:43.791
-I mean, you have no sense of humor.
-You have the sensitivity of a rock.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.420
Hey, I sprung for 50 bucks, right?
When I'm totally broke.

09:47.837 --> 09:48.754
I thought you'd like it.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.090
Joe, you embarrassed me.
Don't you see that?

09:51.173 --> 09:53.634
And besides, now people might think
that we're doin' it.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.261
Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

09:55.344 --> 09:58.723
I get you a stripper for your birthday,
and people think we're gonna be makin' it.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.474
You know what your problem is?

10:00.558 --> 10:04.228
You're sublimating
your sexual needs into anger,

10:04.312 --> 10:06.606
and, uh, projecting it all onto me.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.652
Great, Joe. Real deep.

10:12.236 --> 10:15.156
(chattering on police radio)

10:18.367 --> 10:22.330

I guess I'd pay off all my debts,
all my family debts.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.037
Maybe I'd buy a-a house.

11:04.914 --> 11:09.543
Yeah. You know, I'd buy me a house
maybe somewhere out in the country,

11:09.627 --> 11:11.504
-overlooking a lake.
-I see.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.590

11:15.383 --> 11:17.843
-Renko.
-Nothing is the matter, Officer Hill.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.305
-All right, Officer Renko.
-All right, fine!

11:23.015 --> 11:25.851
It's just if somebody gave me
that kind of largesse,

11:25.935 --> 11:27.978
you can bet I'd give some to my partner.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.147
-I would give you some, Renko.
-After I'd begged.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.983

-They do the armored car?
-Dollars to doughnuts.

See if they want to talk
before their lawyers get here.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.070
Oh, Francis, the two security guards died.

13:00.446 --> 13:04.617
There was some initial confusion,
but, apparently, they were both D.O.A.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.495
We'll interrogate on the basis
of double felony murder.

13:07.578 --> 13:11.165
Have Ray come to my office, would you,
Phil? We're about to be hip-deep in media.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.125
WOMAN: Uhuru.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.337
LEO: Is that how you want to be booked?
Just Uhuru?

13:17.546 --> 13:18.923
Do you have lawyers you want contacted?

13:19.006 --> 13:22.927
-I want a public defender.
-KL 5-3935.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.845
Is that your lawyer's phone number?

13:26.138 --> 13:27.097
What's your lawyer's name?

13:28.182 --> 13:29.475
LYNN: You don't talk to me, you hear?

13:29.558 --> 13:32.144
You want a traitor, you talk to the scared
little white girl!

13:32.228 --> 13:34.355
-Hey, homecoming queen, what you gonna do?
-MAN: Get her out of here!

13:34.438 --> 13:36.273
RENKO: You got a lot of nerve.
Spittin' in somebody's face.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.151
LYNN: Get your hands off me, you pig!
Let go of me!

13:40.069 --> 13:42.071
-Lock her up.
-LYNN: Let go of me, you pig!

13:44.782 --> 13:50.329
In May, 1981, I helped three other people
rob a gun shop

13:50.955 --> 13:52.748
in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.502
In November, 1981,

13:56.919 --> 14:00.923
I planned and helped rob
a convenience store

14:01.507 --> 14:03.634
in York, Pennsylvania.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.805
In February, 1982,

14:08.472 --> 14:10.891
I was present when a bank was robbed.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.144
(sighs) In Newark, New Jersey.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.898
Nobody was hurt.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.441
This is very interesting.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.112
Right now
I've got a fresh double homicide.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.156
-Where can we find--
-I won't implicate anyone else.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.368
I will not give information
on anyone else's whereabouts.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.123
Tell us some of the places
you've lived then.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.505
-Where were you living--
-I went underground in 1970

14:41.589 --> 14:43.173
after the Broome Street explosion.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.634
Not 1970. Now. Yesterday.

14:45.718 --> 14:50.556
-Over the past two weeks.
-I lived at 1428 Dekker till Tuesday.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.683
And then I lived at the Hotel Crane.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.812
Christina Beck?
You requested a public defender?

14:57.771 --> 14:59.189
My name's Joyce Davenport.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.652
I suggest you stop talking
with the sergeant and that we confer.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.113
Miss Davenport, Ronald Schuster is here.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.324
He'd like a conference with you
and your client.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.868
Showtime.

15:12.578 --> 15:16.498
Christina, I want you to know that you've
done nothing to compromise yourself

15:16.582 --> 15:17.666
or anybody else.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.794
You have done nothing but respond

15:20.878 --> 15:25.090
to a charged and a dangerous
and a stressful situation.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.219
Uhuru's authorized me to say
that she feels no betrayal.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.889
Christina, we also want you to know,

15:32.264 --> 15:34.475
that political solidarity aside,

15:35.392 --> 15:38.479
we think it's just plain good
sense to coordinate strategy,

15:38.896 --> 15:40.773
so we can maximize our leverage

15:41.231 --> 15:44.193
and benefit from whatever cooperation
anybody might give.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.115
Hey, Christina, are you hearing me?

15:51.951 --> 15:52.785
It's over.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.788
Nothing is over.

15:58.290 --> 16:02.086
I think for the moment if we can agree
that all dealings with the authorities

16:02.169 --> 16:03.462
should be through counsel.

16:03.879 --> 16:04.838
Absolutely.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.383
All right, Christina?

16:09.259 --> 16:12.930
I have to tell you. You cut quite a figure
in my emotional life

16:13.013 --> 16:14.473
when I was training for the law.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.686
-I guess even before that.
-You're gracious to say so.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.106
-How are we gonna do with her?
-Christina Beck?

16:22.564 --> 16:25.859
Seemed to me you got through.
She was willing to cooperate.

16:26.527 --> 16:27.403
With whom?

16:28.487 --> 16:30.197
I think she'll let us bargain for her.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.741
-She'll let me bargain.
-(chuckles)

16:33.450 --> 16:35.577
We'll coordinate in about half an hour?

16:37.830 --> 16:41.000
Uh, listen, I'm afraid lunch is a goner.
I'm sorry.

16:42.001 --> 16:42.835
Okay.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.339
Suppose any of those addresses she gave us
are live?

16:47.423 --> 16:50.217
I'd try the Hotel Crane especially.
That was their most recent.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.510
Send Bates and Coffey.

16:51.593 --> 16:52.928
-They have any names?
-Mm-mm.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.805
-Better add an open warrant.
-Right.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.849
(indistinct chatter)

16:56.932 --> 16:58.475
Worked there for more than ten years.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.936
Moved through a network
of affiliated organizations

17:01.020 --> 17:03.105
which include the P.R.O., the P.R.D.,

17:03.188 --> 17:05.858
the Fourteenth of October Group,
a Black separatist organization

17:05.941 --> 17:07.484
which calls itself Uhuru.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.820
-Agent Davis?
-Are you Captain Furillo?

17:09.903 --> 17:12.740
-Uh, could I talk to you for a minute?
-Oh, certainly, you may.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.116
Can you run it down for me?

17:14.199 --> 17:17.202
Six of them in two cars got $1.6 million

17:17.286 --> 17:21.415
from a Johnstone Armored Car about 8:30
this morning at Fourth Street downtown.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.875
They shot and killed both guards.

17:22.958 --> 17:26.003
-We have two robbers. The third's dead.
-This William Jones?

17:26.086 --> 17:28.464
Correct. Now you know
as much about it as we do.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.842
What about the guards?
Is that execution style?

17:31.925 --> 17:34.053
That's the way that Frazier
and Jones always do it.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.013
In the back of the neck at close range.

17:36.555 --> 17:40.184
Excuse me, Captain. I thought we might
cancel the lunch breaks.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.101
Good idea, Phil.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.855
I also thought we might try
this Chinese takeout.

17:46.356 --> 17:47.191
Good.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.194
Well, uh, what can I order
for you, gentlemen?

17:50.527 --> 17:54.073
Oh, uh, F.B.I. Agent Davis,
Sergeant Esterhaus.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.033
-How do you do, sir?
-Fine.

17:56.325 --> 18:01.538
Let me tell you. The litmus test of
Chinese cooking is dumplings in hot oil.

18:02.164 --> 18:02.998
Great.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.084
I was posted to a trade legation
in Shanghai.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.252
-I got hooked.
-Excuse the interruption.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.714
You can bank on it, Captain.
They took that armored car off.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.174
I think you could also safely assume

18:12.257 --> 18:14.885
that at least some of these names
were involved.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.554
And here's a list of safe houses
for you to run down.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.389
I don't know how current
this information is.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.849
It's certainly worth checking out.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.436
Oh, uh, that name, right there?
That's the purchasing agent.

18:24.812 --> 18:25.729
Lenore Kramer.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.940
She gets the cars.
She gets the safe houses.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.233
How do you know?

18:30.609 --> 18:32.778
Was that a, uh, car rental
on a phony card?

18:33.070 --> 18:35.823
-Yes.
-That's the way she does it.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.658
That's the way anyone would do it.

18:38.575 --> 18:41.453
Listen, I'd pick her up if I were you.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.165
Do we have any federal paper on her?

18:45.707 --> 18:46.708
Mm, nothing current.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.711
Phil. Phil?

18:51.171 --> 18:53.549
-Yes, Francis?
-Let's see if we have any warrants,

18:53.632 --> 18:55.843
city warrants,
outstanding on Lenore Kramer.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.679
-If not, let's pick her up on charges.
-What charges?

18:59.012 --> 18:59.847
Conspiracy.

19:04.726 --> 19:05.936
What's going on, gentlemen?

19:06.019 --> 19:07.896
We're getting
some Chinese eatin', Captain.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.357
Man, these menus are like a novel.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.693
Let's just order two dozen
from column "A,"

19:12.776 --> 19:15.737
two dozen from column "B," and then
let's get back to work, okay?

19:15.821 --> 19:17.239
-Yes, sir.
-I hope you ordered double

19:17.322 --> 19:18.532
for Lenore Kramer.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.367
Wait till you hear the mouth on her.

19:20.450 --> 19:23.120
-Identify yourselves.
-Miss Kramer, I'm Officer Hill.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.372
This is Officer Renko
from the Hill Street Station.

19:25.455 --> 19:28.667
-We have a warrant for your arrest.
-Show me your identification cards.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.002
Read me the warrant.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.507
-Conspiracy?
-Let's go, ma'am.

19:35.591 --> 19:40.179
Oh, you have nothin'! You don't even have
the barest fragment of a connection.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.014
Oh.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.434
Pathetic fascist after-death spasms.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.604
You go ahead. Coerce your usual suspects.
Oppress your usual suspects.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.273
Ma'am, you want to be quiet
and just get out this door, please?

19:51.356 --> 19:54.234
Oh, yes, cave dweller. Yes, leopard suit.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.528
Redneck lackey. Fat piece of garbage.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.155
-Errand boys of genocide.
-All right, ma'am.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.616
All right, ma'am. All right, ma'am.
"Otay," Buckwheat!

20:00.991 --> 20:03.535
You just keep your mouth shut. Let's go.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.624
MALE VOICE:<i> I'm top gun in these parts.</i>

20:08.832 --> 20:11.627
<i>You'll have to be fast to outdraw me.</i>

20:12.085 --> 20:15.214
<i>Remember to cock the gun when you draw.</i>

20:19.468 --> 20:20.427
<i>Ready?</i>

20:21.595 --> 20:23.639
<i>-Draw!</i>
-(gunfire sounds)

20:25.474 --> 20:28.310
(laughs)<i> You missed me, sidewinder!</i>

20:28.393 --> 20:30.646
<i>-Let's go again!</i>
-(growls)

20:30.729 --> 20:33.815
-Pretty dangerous company, Mick.
-He's not so fast.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.401
Well, so far this morning,
I've destroyed 20 alien planets,

20:36.485 --> 20:39.363
57 battle stars and a couple hundred
thousand Nazi submarines.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.989
I'm ready to beat
my quarters into plowshares.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.659
I'm going across the street
for some coffee. Anybody want anything?

20:43.742 --> 20:44.576
No.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.205
MALE VOICE:
<i>All right, you big-horned dude.</i>

20:48.664 --> 20:51.750
<i>-I told you I was the fastest draw.</i>
-(growls)

20:52.668 --> 20:53.669
<i>Get set.</i>

20:55.045 --> 20:57.839
<i>-Draw!</i>
-(gunfire sounds)

20:57.923 --> 21:00.968
(howls)<i> You got me!</i>

21:01.051 --> 21:03.178
<i>You ought to retire on me.</i>

21:03.512 --> 21:06.932
<i>I-- You went for your gun</i>
<i>before I was ready.</i>

21:07.015 --> 21:09.476
<i>That's all. Try again.</i>

21:09.559 --> 21:12.271
-That'll be 22.47, sir.
-Okay.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.909
-That'll be a buck, ten apiece.
-A buck, ten apiece for what?

21:26.243 --> 21:29.538
-The cookies, man.
-Oh, the cookies.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.665
Oh, well, they're on the house, pal.

21:32.165 --> 21:34.710
Hey, man, this is my place,
and they ain't on the house.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.254
A buck, ten apiece, money man.

21:38.213 --> 21:39.047
(scoffs)

21:40.507 --> 21:41.800
Here. Have a cookie.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.927
-You want a cookie?
-Hey! Hey, cool it, buddy!

21:44.011 --> 21:46.555
-What's wrong with you?
-Don't get stupid, stupid!

21:46.638 --> 21:47.597
Police officer.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.772
(explosion)

21:56.315 --> 21:59.609
-(machine whirring)
-(bells ringing)

22:04.531 --> 22:07.159
(engine roars, tires squeal)

22:07.242 --> 22:10.078
Hey! Come here! He shot a police!

22:11.121 --> 22:11.955
Mick!

22:15.125 --> 22:17.169
-Pete!
-(horn honking)

22:18.670 --> 22:19.504
Pete!

22:20.172 --> 22:22.966
Help! Somebody call the police!
Man's been shot!

22:23.300 --> 22:25.135
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

22:25.594 --> 22:28.096
Go get the car. Move!

22:30.682 --> 22:31.767
-(groaning)
-(grunts)

22:33.060 --> 22:34.519
Move back, will you, please?

22:35.228 --> 22:36.646
Move back!

22:52.079 --> 22:55.415
-Who'd you rent the car for?
-(scoffs) John Wilkes Booth.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.418
Oh, or which car? The Pontiac? Lee Oswald.

23:00.587 --> 23:04.132
You think it's funny, Lenore?
You think murder's funny?

23:04.424 --> 23:08.303
I think you're funny. I think--
I think you're disgusting and pathetic.

23:08.595 --> 23:11.765
You drag me in here
on some kind of senile information.

23:13.308 --> 23:16.228
There were cars and apartments rented,
Lenore. You do have a history.

23:16.311 --> 23:19.022
Oh, no, she's a real estate agent now.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.899
God, I wish I had been
the purchasing agent.

23:20.982 --> 23:24.027
'Cause I'd bet it'd take your usual
six years to run it down.

23:24.736 --> 23:27.114
Yes, Mick. Yes, I understand.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.492
Keep us in touch, will you? Thanks.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.746
-Gung Ho!
-Please, put it over there on that table.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.709
There's no change.
He's still on the operating table.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.628
It's going to be awhile yet.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.383
-Gung Ho.
-Oh, of course, sure.

23:48.009 --> 23:50.512
-Here, uh, keep the change.
-Gung-Ho!

23:50.595 --> 23:52.722
-Thank you.
-Our men are armed and on ready alert.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.683
We can hit the bricks
in less than 30 seconds.

23:54.766 --> 23:57.269
We can be anywhere in this precinct
within ten minutes.

23:57.978 --> 23:58.812
(groans)

23:59.020 --> 23:59.855
How's that coming?

24:00.188 --> 24:02.190
Ah, dental treatment
will just have to wait.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.026
Mark my words, Frank.
This one's gonna end up on the street.

24:06.236 --> 24:09.865
Captain, we drew blanks on Agent Davis's
list of possible safe houses.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.159
The one on Haley burned down
four years ago.

24:12.242 --> 24:16.163
And Borellis and Smiljanich
found a day-care center at Lombard Street.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.915
Agent Davis's information
seems a little dated.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.836
Francis, we've got signatures
of the, uh, rental car agreements.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.298
Department graphologist
says there's no way Lenore Kramer

24:26.381 --> 24:27.799
could've forged those names.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.384
Damn! Thanks, Phil.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.014
Cleveland, March 21st, 1968, arson.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.016
Army recruiting center.
You were the buyer.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.726
Maybe. Maybe.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.686
DAVIS:
You've got that blood on your hands.

24:40.103 --> 24:42.814
San Francisco, February the 2nd, 1969.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.276
Bomb went off in a van parked outside
a draft registration office.

24:46.943 --> 24:49.237
Assault on a government
official in New York.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.907
Records destruction in Tulsa.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.034
Right. Right. Go ahead. Run it.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.287
Let's talk about your old munitions buddy.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.331
Norman Downs, you remember him?

25:00.457 --> 25:01.917
The guy you're supposed to be
in love with?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.293
The guy blew himself up?

25:03.668 --> 25:06.213
Tell me something, Lenore. Was he better
in bed than he was making bombs?

25:06.296 --> 25:07.255
All right.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.010
There were apartments rented,
and there were cars.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.555
Agent Davis, may I see you for a minute?

25:17.474 --> 25:18.308
(sighs)

25:21.269 --> 25:22.229
Okay, Lenore.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.564
-Where's her counsel?
-She refused one.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.358
It might interfere with her martyrdom.

25:26.441 --> 25:28.985
I'm letting her go
as soon as the paperwork's done.

25:29.069 --> 25:29.903
Why?

25:30.153 --> 25:31.905
The signature on the car rental form
isn't hers.

25:31.988 --> 25:33.865
We checked it against a Washington file.

25:34.324 --> 25:37.077
In fact, we don't show anything
connecting her with the movement

25:37.160 --> 25:38.286
for the last three years.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.121
Look, Furillo, I know this girl.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.165
Just let me work on her
a couple of more hours.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.709
The paperwork
can take a couple more hours!

25:44.793 --> 25:46.294
Frank, Frank, look at this.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.422
The license number we got on the car
at the Dorsey shooting,

25:49.506 --> 25:52.717
matches the license of the second vehicle
used in the armored car robbery.

25:52.801 --> 25:53.969
Same people? You sure?

25:54.302 --> 25:57.472
Yes. They checked the $50 bill the shooter
gave the store owner.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.057
It's from the million, six.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.434
Dorsey walked right into it.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.813
FURILLO: You've probably heard
a policeman was shot.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.481
Dorsey. How is he?

26:06.565 --> 26:10.151
Not good. They've tied the shooter's
car license to your people.

26:10.527 --> 26:14.447
Captain, unless you figure they can break
the laws of time and space,

26:14.531 --> 26:16.241
our clients could hardly
be capable of, uh--

26:16.324 --> 26:19.035
If you'll be quiet, I'll tell you
what I think they're capable of.

26:19.119 --> 26:23.248
You're right. Their only connection
with this shooting is moral and practical.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.333
As a legal matter, they're innocent.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.420
And if they give us information
that leads to accomplices,

26:28.503 --> 26:30.297
they'll be doing themselves a lot of good.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.591
I'd like to hear some specific numbers.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.927
I want some specific information,
and I want it fast.

26:38.513 --> 26:39.347
That's all.

26:44.102 --> 26:46.062
-What's your take on him?
-Captain?

26:46.688 --> 26:48.565
Has he got juice with the D.A.'s office?

26:49.107 --> 26:50.942
If he says to deal, they'll deal.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.946
Clearly, Christina and Uhuru
have to make their own decision.

26:55.447 --> 26:59.993
But it's our responsibility to indicate to
them just how, uh, strong a card this is.

27:00.702 --> 27:04.623
If either chooses to provide
names, address,

27:05.498 --> 27:08.668
we use it to buy as much as we can
for both of them.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.630
-Deal?
-Deal.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.798
See you in a little while.

27:19.846 --> 27:22.223
-(clanking)
-Mm.

27:24.017 --> 27:27.187
Despicable affair, Henry. (grimaces)

27:27.270 --> 27:28.688
-What?
-Oh.

27:28.772 --> 27:33.652
It started off with a small, unattended
occlusal of the lower number one bicuspid,

27:33.735 --> 27:37.364
and now it has eaten clean
through to the pulp. Oh.

27:39.824 --> 27:42.452
There's a pointed analogue here, Henry--

27:42.535 --> 27:44.996
How years of liberal permissiveness

27:45.372 --> 27:47.332
have allowed a few destructive malcontents

27:47.415 --> 27:50.669
to burrow into the enamel
of American society.

27:50.752 --> 27:54.047
(grimaces) Oh! Judas!

27:56.508 --> 28:02.180
We are the dentists of society, Henry,
fighting a losing battle with urban decay.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.143
-HUNTER: Frank.
-FURILLO: Howard.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.940
Did you say go slow
releasing Lenore Kramer?

28:12.023 --> 28:12.857
No.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.611
-Let her go.
-I'm putting it through.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.489
I don't think she's gonna sign
the false arrest waiver.

28:19.572 --> 28:21.449
That's the least of my problems right now.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.120
-How's Dorsey?
-He was gut shot.

28:25.620 --> 28:28.456
-They need blood?
-Mick says they're okay for now.

28:30.583 --> 28:31.418
(scoffs)

28:33.086 --> 28:36.172
I watched this woman spit poison, Frank,

28:37.424 --> 28:39.217
and Davis spit it right back at her.

28:40.677 --> 28:44.013
There was a time when Lenore Kramer and I
probably read the same books,

28:44.097 --> 28:45.640
marched in the same marches.

28:46.307 --> 28:48.143
Now she's just a robber. I'm just a cop.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.147
Is that what happens to every idea, Frank?

28:52.647 --> 28:54.107
That what happens to everything?

28:55.024 --> 28:56.693
I'll speed up Leo with the paperwork.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.988
It's okay. I think they're enjoying it.

29:04.951 --> 29:05.785
Frank!

29:06.578 --> 29:08.705
(sighs) What's the problem, Fay?

29:09.330 --> 29:13.084
My life! It's in a shambles, Frank.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.628
I'm a mess. I'm useless!

29:16.838 --> 29:19.758
Well, the judge and I-- Oh, never mind.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.927
I've been compulsively eating
since 8:00 a.m. yesterday.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.805
-Fay--
-And now Frank Jr.!

29:26.097 --> 29:27.265
What about Frank Jr.?

29:27.474 --> 29:30.477
Well, he wants to trade me in
on a new mother.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.312
Why?

29:32.979 --> 29:37.025
Because I'm not tall. I'm not perfect.
I'm not beautiful.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.320
And I don't treat him like a little prince
the way certain people do.

29:40.403 --> 29:41.362
Certain people?

29:42.489 --> 29:47.035
-Ms. Davenport, as for instance.
-Oh, come off it, Fay.

29:47.118 --> 29:50.455
I don't think Joyce has even seen him
since the ski trip at Christmas.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.041
Well, she certainly made
a hell of an impression on him.

29:53.124 --> 29:55.293
He thinks she's the best thing
since Pac-Man.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.171
And who's food is this?
Why aren't they eating it?

29:58.254 --> 30:03.051
Fay, I think maybe you're exaggerating
a mild schoolboy crush here.

30:03.426 --> 30:04.260
Am I?

30:05.011 --> 30:08.681
Every time I say anything to him,
he throws Joyce Davenport in my face!

30:08.765 --> 30:12.811
That's all I hear! I mean, 20 times a day,
he compares me to her.

30:12.894 --> 30:15.939
I mean, she's the good fairy,
and I'm the Wicked Witch of the West

30:16.022 --> 30:19.943
who tells him that he has to clean up
his room or-- or turn off the TV.

30:23.112 --> 30:25.824
(sniffles) I know I'm being stupid,
Frank, but...

30:26.741 --> 30:29.953
Well, I lost one popularity contest
to that woman a-- and I...

30:30.453 --> 30:32.121
I just don't think I can handle another.

30:32.205 --> 30:35.583
Ah, let's just go in the office,
all right? Come on.

30:39.712 --> 30:40.547
(sniffs)

30:41.464 --> 30:46.094
Oh, Saigon Sally's, 1968.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.471
(sighs)

30:50.807 --> 30:52.725
Oh. (sniffs)

30:52.809 --> 30:56.771
Mm, looks malleable enough
for the old jawbone.

31:02.735 --> 31:03.862
Mm. Not bad.

31:04.571 --> 31:09.200
Fay, being a single parent,
it's not a popularity contest.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.451
You're telling me.

31:11.661 --> 31:12.996
It's nothing to be concerned about.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.915
It happens to all boys his age,
and it never lasts.

31:16.332 --> 31:17.709
With me, it was Lana Turner.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.086
Yeah, but was Lana Turner
dating your father?

31:20.962 --> 31:23.214
You're his mother. He knows that.

31:23.506 --> 31:26.217
That's an attachment
nobody can break or wants to.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.970
Will you tell that to your son?

31:31.556 --> 31:33.099
I'll have dinner with him tonight.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.143
You know, this is good.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.814
-(mumbles) Mm-hmm.
-You like it?

31:39.898 --> 31:41.608
-Wait, there's another box here.
-Okay.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.777
Come on, pal.
Just sign, or we'll take you in.

31:48.072 --> 31:51.284
You know, first you get Andy a hooker
for his birthday.

31:51.367 --> 31:54.495
Now you gotta give me a performing
slab of beef for mine.

31:55.121 --> 31:56.873
You just don't realize that most people

31:56.956 --> 31:59.751
are not stuck in this glandular
development the way you are.

31:59.834 --> 32:00.752
Have a nice day.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.880
You know, I never knew
you were such a prude, Luce.

32:03.963 --> 32:06.549
(scoffs) A prude? Oh, great.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.884
I just don't like it, you know,

32:07.967 --> 32:10.511
when somebody makes a spectacle of me
for a cheap laugh.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.348
-Hey, it wasn't cheap!
-(tires squeal)

32:16.476 --> 32:18.186
-(horn honks)
-Here. You drive.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.439
-(ripping)
-Ooh.

32:24.901 --> 32:27.236
-Hey, Luce.
-What's the matter?

32:30.114 --> 32:32.492
Uh-- Man, I split my pants.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.994
-You're kidding. Let me see.
-Come on!

32:36.704 --> 32:39.290
Let me see. Take 'em off.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.542
What do you mean, "Take 'em off"?
I'm not takin' 'em off.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.504
Just take 'em off. There's a tailor shop
three blocks down there.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.047
I'll take 'em in for a quickie.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.675
Or would you rather walk
into the precinct like this, huh?

32:49.217 --> 32:50.134
Come on. I'll drive.

32:55.682 --> 32:58.393
Man, I was hoping to get
another winter out of these pants.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.061
This leaves me with one pair left.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.814
Yeah. Well, if you weren't so busy

33:02.897 --> 33:05.233
spending your money
on the nightclub circuit,

33:05.441 --> 33:07.819
maybe you would have enough
to buy another uniform.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.529
All right, Luce, I've had it!

33:09.612 --> 33:12.031
You don't own me,
so don't tell me how to run my life!

33:12.115 --> 33:15.118
So just can it!
And hurry up with the pants.

33:25.628 --> 33:29.007
-Hey, Joe!
-Luce, what're you doin'?

33:31.884 --> 33:32.844
Lucy!

33:33.594 --> 33:36.097
What's the matter? Did you lose
your sense of humor, huh?

33:39.767 --> 33:41.394
I got a look at the wound, Captain.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.231
Well, I haven't seen too many
that were worse.

33:45.314 --> 33:46.816
I don't think he's gonna make it.

33:49.819 --> 33:52.655
Uh, I gotta go.
I'll call you when there's more news.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.032
Yeah, right.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.577
I was the wrong type, but I gave anyway.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.538
Oh. Oh, maybe you oughta sit down.

34:01.247 --> 34:03.374
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Mrs. Baker, please come to Admitting.</i>

34:03.458 --> 34:05.752
<i>Mrs. Baker, please come to Admitting.</i>

34:07.420 --> 34:09.088
He's been in there five hours, Mick.

34:09.756 --> 34:11.966
I mean, I mean, that's good, isn't it?

34:12.216 --> 34:14.177
-I-- if he's held on this long--
-Hey.

34:14.969 --> 34:17.305
We weren't gonna talk
about it anymore, remember?

34:18.681 --> 34:19.682
That was the deal.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.478
But he's got a chance, right?

34:24.687 --> 34:26.105
We don't talk about it.

34:26.355 --> 34:28.483
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Mrs. Barker, please come to Admitting.</i>

34:28.566 --> 34:30.943
<i>Mrs. Barker, please come to Admitting.</i>

34:34.989 --> 34:36.199
You got any hobbies?

34:39.243 --> 34:41.537
Your boyfriend.
Tell me about your boyfriend.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.874
Come on. You gotta have a boyfriend.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.920
He didn't like the idea of me being a cop.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.424
Do you have a girlfriend?

34:54.092 --> 34:55.093
Me? No. (chuckles)

34:57.970 --> 34:59.847
I-- I think I'm too hard to live with.

35:00.807 --> 35:01.641
No, you're not.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.686
I mean, I think you're just right.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.774
It could be their fault, you know.

35:09.857 --> 35:12.443
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Dr. Antonio, report to Intensive Care.</i>

35:12.693 --> 35:15.446
<i>Dr. Antonio, report to Intensive Care.</i>

35:17.990 --> 35:19.909
Oh, look at that.
These guys are just great.

35:19.992 --> 35:21.869
They hit the vein clean every time.

35:23.454 --> 35:25.456
You know what you ought to do
when you get home?

35:25.540 --> 35:28.334
Eat some peanut butter
and drink plenty of juice.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.922
I guess I should get used
to giving this stuff, huh?

35:33.798 --> 35:36.342
WOMAN (on P.A.):<i> Dr. Farley, 1823.</i>

35:36.425 --> 35:38.928
<i>Dr. Farley, 1823.</i>

35:40.513 --> 35:41.347
I'm sorry.

35:55.778 --> 35:58.364
(sobbing quietly)

36:06.122 --> 36:07.456
(sobbing)

36:11.961 --> 36:15.173
Mother's living out in Arizona. We've been
trying to reach her since the shooting.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.175
The brother's in town,
but he's on vacation.

36:17.466 --> 36:20.011
-We know where?
-CALLETANO: His plant thought Taft Lake.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.638
But I've tried all the lodges,
and I haven't been able to.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.766
-Keep trying.
-They're gonna hear it on the radio.

36:27.810 --> 36:31.480
-Miss Davenport.
-You wanted to see me?

36:32.064 --> 36:33.524
Schuster was just in.

36:34.108 --> 36:35.860
We think Christina knows more, but...

36:36.944 --> 36:38.988
Ms. Croyden is prepared to come forward.

36:39.071 --> 36:41.699
-How much time?
-Fifteen minutes, 20 max.

36:42.742 --> 36:45.161
I'll talk to my client. Frank.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.247
About Dorsey, I'm sorry.

36:54.420 --> 36:55.254
Counselor.

36:56.088 --> 36:58.007
My client wouldn't agree to share.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.134
We've made a separate proposal
to the captain.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.636
So I've been informed.

37:03.429 --> 37:07.475
-You want me in there?
-No, thank you. Not necessary.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.149
(chuckles)

37:16.943 --> 37:18.736
Uh, could you excuse us, please?

37:21.864 --> 37:23.950
What do you want to hang around here for?

37:24.033 --> 37:25.868
-Why don't you just take off?
-No.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.954
Are you sure? You don't need to be here.

37:28.287 --> 37:30.915
Please, Mick, you gotta stick by me.
I, um...

37:32.458 --> 37:35.002
-I don't want to be alone yet.
-Okay.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.089
Uh, we could get a cup of coffee,

37:38.172 --> 37:41.384
and I, um, I could take you through
the paperwork if you feel up to it.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.303
-Yeah, I think so.
-Okay.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.264
So let's go over this.

37:47.181 --> 37:50.393
The three still out are Frazier,
Thornton Williams and Timothy Smith.

37:50.810 --> 37:53.145
Frazier's friend's address
is 393 Dennoyer.

37:53.479 --> 37:58.401
If the address leads to arrests, it could
be worth eight years off a sentence.

37:59.110 --> 38:03.406
Subtract another five for the names,
another five for in-court testimony,

38:03.948 --> 38:07.285
and then let's assume, uh,
we do some business on your background.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.872
The repentant lost sheep
of the upper middle class,

38:12.248 --> 38:16.002
combined with the fact you're a mother,
a child six years old,

38:16.419 --> 38:18.087
that's probably worth another five.

38:18.754 --> 38:21.048
Off a sentence of 35 years,

38:21.132 --> 38:24.385
and assuming you never pulled a trigger,
we're down to 10 or 12.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.220
You might still have a life left.

38:30.433 --> 38:33.394
You better hurry up.
Uhuru's going to beat you to it.

38:36.897 --> 38:38.691
(scoffs) Go ahead.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.234
Hmm?

38:42.069 --> 38:43.612
Go ahead!

38:46.240 --> 38:49.785
Hey, why not?

38:58.836 --> 39:01.797
(indistinct radio chatter)

39:05.843 --> 39:08.262
(helicopter whirs)

39:12.725 --> 39:13.934
HUNTER (on bullhorn):<i> Attention!</i>

39:14.477 --> 39:18.814
<i>Attention all occupants</i>
<i>of 393 Dennoyer Street.</i>

39:19.523 --> 39:24.070
<i>This is the police. You are ordered</i>
<i>to come out with your hands up.</i>

39:24.904 --> 39:27.073
-(sirens wailing in distance)
<i>-You will be taken into custody.</i>

39:27.156 --> 39:28.532
<i>You will not be hurt.</i>

39:36.791 --> 39:37.666
(gunfire stops)

39:41.253 --> 39:42.880
There are people in there
that want to die.

39:42.963 --> 39:43.798
Let me try.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.470
(on bullhorn)<i> This is Captain Furillo</i>
<i>of Hill Street Station.</i>

39:49.804 --> 39:52.598
<i>I repeat. You are completely surrounded.</i>

39:52.681 --> 39:54.183
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

39:57.061 --> 39:58.062
Nobody's picking up.

39:58.437 --> 40:00.940
Ballantine! The fire department in place?

40:01.023 --> 40:01.941
Yes, sir!

40:02.191 --> 40:04.193
And all the tenants
of the adjoining apartment building

40:04.276 --> 40:05.444
have been evacuated, sir.

40:05.820 --> 40:09.323
All right. All personnel,
prepare for deployment of tear gas.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.910
-(helicopter whirs)
-(indistinct radio chatter)

40:13.577 --> 40:16.664
FURILLO (on bullhorn):
<i>Attention! Harold Frazier,</i>

40:17.123 --> 40:20.418
<i>Thornton Williams, Timothy Smith...</i>

40:21.293 --> 40:24.672
<i>and all other occupants</i>
<i>of 393 Dennoyer Street,</i>

40:25.005 --> 40:28.801
<i>come out now with your hands up.</i>
<i>This is your final warning.</i>

40:31.470 --> 40:32.930
Line's working, but still nothing.

40:34.014 --> 40:35.182
(gunshots)

40:36.475 --> 40:38.978
-(gunshots continue)
-Brewster, Konicki,

40:39.061 --> 40:40.646
proceed with C.N. deployment.

40:47.486 --> 40:48.988
(coughing)

41:01.959 --> 41:04.545
-Everybody has the green light.
-(gunfire continues)

41:04.628 --> 41:07.298
Commence firing!
All personnel, commence firing.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.621
Cease firing. Cease firing.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.626
(indistinct chatter on police radio)

41:45.753 --> 41:47.838
(helicopter whirring)

42:09.360 --> 42:11.862
GOLDBLUME:
Michaels says they could all be suicides.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.076
Or rather, this one, Frazier,

42:18.369 --> 42:21.038
opened fire on the other two,
then shot himself.

42:22.081 --> 42:22.957
He fits the description

42:23.040 --> 42:24.667
-of Dorsey's killer.
-Yeah.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.794
HILL:
Hey, Captain, you want to see somethin'?

42:30.965 --> 42:33.634
They must've burned up
over a million dollars here, Captain.

42:34.009 --> 42:36.720
Just threw kerosene on it, you know?

42:41.850 --> 42:44.645
Frank, Frank, Dorsey's brother called.

42:44.728 --> 42:47.064
-He heard it on the news.
-Oh, no.

42:47.147 --> 42:49.900
-He's going to call their mother.
-Well, we tried.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.611
-Captain?
-Yeah, Neal.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.863
Just doin' a little survey here.
How do you feel?

42:55.322 --> 42:58.367
-As a matter of fact, not too well.
-How 'bout you, Lieutenant?

42:58.701 --> 43:00.744
-Fine.
-What'd you both have for lunch?

43:00.828 --> 43:02.538
-Ham sandwich and a Coke.
-Mu shu pork.

43:02.621 --> 43:05.541
Oh, Captain. Excuse me.

43:05.624 --> 43:09.670
Gung Ho? Ray, do me a favor,
would you, please?

43:09.753 --> 43:13.507
Call Fay and explain to her why she's sick
or is about to be sick?

43:13.966 --> 43:16.510
Tell her I'm in no condition
to have dinner with Frank Jr.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.974
Nice pants, Joe.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.059
Real ivy.

43:24.727 --> 43:25.728
Hey, it's a look.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.106
You know, Leo, you know what I love
about this guy?

43:29.189 --> 43:30.816
He's kept his sense of humor, huh?

43:30.899 --> 43:33.444
Good old Joe,
never loses his sense of humor.

43:34.612 --> 43:38.449
Hey, are we still having dinner tonight,
or what?

43:42.244 --> 43:44.580
I promise I'll go home,
and I'll change. Okay?

43:44.663 --> 43:46.749
-If that makes you happy.
-Okay.

43:46.832 --> 43:49.585
Yes, we're having dinner.
It's my birthday. What do you think?

43:51.545 --> 43:53.797
-(belching)
-(toilet flushes)

43:54.923 --> 43:58.302
-What's this? A line?
-I'm afraid so, Captain.

43:58.677 --> 44:02.306
The Mayflower's on high seas here,
and the crew's come down with scurvy.

44:02.389 --> 44:04.683
-(groans)
-Howard?

44:05.351 --> 44:09.396
Frank, the mere taste
of chloroacetophenone...

44:09.480 --> 44:13.067
plays pin the donkey
with the old duodenum.

44:13.150 --> 44:16.654
I whiffed no tear gas, Howard,
and I'm sick as a cow.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.406
You know what this is, don't you?

44:20.532 --> 44:23.160
It's Lenore. She's trying to poison us.

44:23.869 --> 44:26.080
She's gotten
into the air-conditioning ducts.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.123
It's just a theory, right?

44:35.339 --> 44:37.591
(water running)

44:38.967 --> 44:39.802
Here.

44:41.178 --> 44:43.681
-What is it?
-Flat ginger ale.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.015
Settles the stomach.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.435
I think that's an old wives' tale.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.106
You're talking about my mother.

44:52.189 --> 44:53.023
Uh-huh.

44:56.151 --> 44:58.445
If I die, promise me you'll sue.

44:58.862 --> 44:59.738
Count on it.

45:01.407 --> 45:02.241
Good?

45:03.492 --> 45:05.035
-Mm.
-(chuckles)

45:07.621 --> 45:10.332
I think I should go home.
I'm humiliating myself.

45:11.166 --> 45:12.251
That's absurd.

45:13.460 --> 45:15.879
I love the sounds of peristalsis.

45:20.634 --> 45:22.636
I scared myself today, Frank.

45:24.138 --> 45:24.972
Why?

45:26.473 --> 45:28.016
I hated that girl so.

45:30.436 --> 45:31.353
Christina Beck?

45:34.273 --> 45:38.152
She's partly responsible
for a lot of people dying today.

45:40.904 --> 45:41.739
You know,

45:43.615 --> 45:47.619
there was a time when I was just
as fascinated with abstractions,

45:48.871 --> 45:51.749
just as sure I had a hotline to the truth.

45:54.710 --> 45:57.379
I wanted to hurt her
for all that smugness.

45:59.131 --> 46:03.343
I wanted to make her know the pain
she had caused with her dilettante ideas.

46:05.846 --> 46:07.848
And at the same time, I felt--

46:09.224 --> 46:10.851
(chuckles) Old.

46:13.312 --> 46:14.480
I felt old.

46:14.897 --> 46:18.150
And the whole time I was with her,
I just wanted to cry.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.030
(chuckles)

46:27.868 --> 46:29.578
(dog barking in distance)

46:34.166 --> 46:35.167
What'd we walk?

46:37.461 --> 46:39.338
I bet you we must've walked ten miles.

46:39.880 --> 46:40.839
Twelve maybe.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.426
-Do your feet hurt?
-Nah.

46:44.760 --> 46:47.137
-Orthopedic shoes.
-(chuckles)

46:50.849 --> 46:51.767
This one's mine.

46:55.813 --> 47:00.859
(sighs) So, um, are you sure
you're not hungry?

47:00.943 --> 47:03.320
-We could still get something to eat.
-(chuckles)

47:04.530 --> 47:07.407
Jews and Italians,
you kinda eat your way through grief.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.494
I sorta got no stomach for it, you know?

47:11.078 --> 47:11.912
Yeah.

47:15.165 --> 47:16.166
Well, um--

47:19.545 --> 47:21.922
What are you gonna do?
You gonna come into work tomorrow?

47:23.882 --> 47:24.716
Yeah. I think.

47:25.092 --> 47:27.594
'Cause if you don't want to,
you don't have to, you know.

47:29.513 --> 47:31.181
I'll worry about it in the morning.

47:32.391 --> 47:33.225
Okay, then.

47:38.480 --> 47:39.523
So, you okay?

47:41.149 --> 47:42.234
-(sniffles)
-I mean--

47:44.027 --> 47:45.863
(sighs) Gee, my eyes are a mess.

47:48.991 --> 47:50.450
No, they're not. They're fine.

47:55.831 --> 47:57.124
You feel like walking a little more?

47:59.543 --> 48:00.544
Yeah, sure.

48:04.089 --> 48:05.465
One more time around the block.

48:06.174 --> 48:07.009
Okay.

48:16.602 --> 48:19.354
(dog barking in distance)

48:33.702 --> 48:36.705
(closing theme playing)
