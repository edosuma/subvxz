00:04.422 --> 00:08.804
I can't believe we don't get to do that
again for another six weeks.

00:12.668 --> 00:14.328
I don't want you to leave.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.672
I love you, Hannah.

00:21.350 --> 00:23.103
Promise me you're coming back?

Coitus Eddie-ruptus.

00:37.392 --> 00:38.416
Hello!

00:38.717 --> 00:41.468
Whoa! Good-bye sex, huh?

00:41.940 --> 00:44.362
- It's always the best kind.
- How would you know?

00:44.473 --> 00:47.000
You never say good-bye.
You're always around.

00:47.035 --> 00:50.300
So here's what I'm thinking.
We call it "best friend windows."

00:50.662 --> 00:51.940
- I like it.
- Yeah?

00:51.954 --> 00:53.401
- Yeah.
- Why best friend windows?

00:53.402 --> 00:55.284
'Cause, uh, we're two best friends

00:55.299 --> 00:58.792
starting a company at installs windows,
'cause if you don't have windows...

00:58.805 --> 01:01.140
- you're pretty much staring at the wall.
- Whoop. - Whoop.

01:01.605 --> 01:03.841
Wow, swell slogan.

01:04.435 --> 01:05.870
What's got her so creased?

01:06.106 --> 01:07.960
She doesn't think I'm coming home.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.873
Oh, come on!

01:11.208 --> 01:13.583
How much backpacking through Europe
can one guy do?

01:13.597 --> 01:16.281
- He'll be back in a few months.
- That's what my uncle Nate said.

01:16.695 --> 01:19.812
My aunt Margaret is still waiting
by the window in her shawl.

01:22.006 --> 01:24.821
Nicky, I never knew you could see
the college from up here.

01:25.116 --> 01:28.500
Oh, boy, that would have come in handy
that summer we had the sniper rifle, huh?

01:32.496 --> 01:35.253
Where did he go--
uncle Nate?

01:36.188 --> 01:38.670
He went to find himself.

01:42.957 --> 01:45.111
- All hail the conquering hero!
- Hey!

01:45.706 --> 01:49.142
I'm sure you know the thing about the search
for the grail being the grail itself.

01:49.155 --> 01:50.961
Why you poppin' daffy, freak show?

01:51.906 --> 01:55.322
- The journey is the destination.
- Thanks, physical Phil.

01:55.707 --> 01:57.402
Oh, oh, I almost forgot.
Hold on.

02:02.008 --> 02:03.502
Take care of her for me.

02:03.647 --> 02:05.771
You're only gonna be gone for,
like, six weeks, bro.

02:05.807 --> 02:07.213
I know, but you never know.

02:07.236 --> 02:08.991
Come on. Let's go.

02:09.705 --> 02:11.502
The traffic to the airport's
bound to be grim.

02:11.605 --> 02:13.763
- Give me a sec, dad.
- Hey, commander.

02:16.107 --> 02:18.412
- Oh, great.
- Have fun, Garrett.

02:18.827 --> 02:20.110
No need to hurry home.

02:20.606 --> 02:22.813
And, uh, if you get lonely, Hannah Jane...

02:23.256 --> 02:26.531
- you know where to find the big cat.
- You've got to be kidding me.

02:27.337 --> 02:29.290
No, no, forget that savage.

02:30.635 --> 02:32.001
I'll see you, Owen Rowan.

02:32.115 --> 02:34.003
- Take care, man.
- You, too, buddy.

02:35.476 --> 02:36.801
I'll see ya, Ikey.

02:37.105 --> 02:39.942
Hurry home, chief.
We'll make window installation history.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.171
You got it, Eddie.

02:43.198 --> 02:44.223
Be safe.

02:45.907 --> 02:47.640
I'll be back at the end of the summer.

02:47.717 --> 02:50.720
Whatever you say... uncle Nate.

02:54.807 --> 02:56.231
Let's go, Ikey.
Come on!

03:12.008 --> 03:13.423
I'll be back in six weeks.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.671
What's the matter with those boys?

03:21.726 --> 03:22.893
I don't know.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.890
- Hello?
- It's your editor, kiddo.

04:45.157 --> 04:46.540
Making any progress?

04:46.608 --> 04:48.463
You ever hear
the one out blood and stone

04:48.476 --> 04:51.403
and the difficulty in extracting
the former from the latter?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.372
Dufresne college called.

04:53.528 --> 04:55.670
They want to know
if you'd be interested in teaching

04:55.675 --> 04:58.752
a 1-day intensive
on the art of the novel.

04:58.918 --> 05:01.652
Uh, not so much.

05:02.137 --> 05:04.683
Dufresne college?
That's in my home town.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.482
I haven't be back there in ten years.

05:06.496 --> 05:08.431
There's some people there that--

05:08.606 --> 05:11.803
- they might not be so happy to see me.
- Maybe that's why you're blocked.

05:12.097 --> 05:14.741
Go back there, make peace with it all.

05:14.765 --> 05:16.633
You gotta get past your fears, kiddo.

05:16.665 --> 05:21.132
G. Gordon Liddy was afraid of rats,
so he cooked one up and ate it.

05:21.147 --> 05:22.161
You're going.

05:22.406 --> 05:25.740
If you're suggesting
that I cook and eat my old friends,

05:26.065 --> 05:28.911
I can assure you, in their opinion,
I already have.

05:29.517 --> 05:33.563
It's this weekend. I know it's short
notice, but John Irving dropped out.

05:33.705 --> 05:36.772
I guess it's just as well. My friends
wouldn't have been nice to him either.

05:37.455 --> 05:39.071
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

05:43.275 --> 05:47.072
Hey, doctor, it's me.
I'm at the club. It's midnight.

05:47.088 --> 05:51.022
Come on by, 'cause we having
a big old party, and we callin' it "life"!

05:51.036 --> 05:52.460
Excuse me, ladies.

05:55.106 --> 05:57.272
Hey, remember my guy,
Nicholson Garrett?

05:57.288 --> 05:59.471
"Turtle on a snare drum."
He's my client.

05:59.477 --> 06:01.143
I'm his agent.
Client, agent.

06:01.147 --> 06:04.461
Of course you loved it.
Come on everybody loved it.

06:09.957 --> 06:12.291
Nicholson, would you sign my book?

06:12.766 --> 06:15.252
Oh, gosh, it really changed my life...

06:16.405 --> 06:18.193
kind of like "Flashdance" did.

06:20.186 --> 06:21.521
Where you going, doctor?

06:21.538 --> 06:23.821
This night is in diapers, man.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.892
Hello?
I'm so sorry. I--

06:38.936 --> 06:42.703
I used to live in this very apartment, and
I had great success here. I was just--

06:43.106 --> 06:44.162
Hello?

06:44.696 --> 06:47.003
Here, I wrote this book.

06:47.378 --> 06:49.160
I'm sorry, but this is my book.
Here.

06:49.787 --> 06:51.633
I-I saw this film.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.102
- Yeah.
- You wrote this book?

06:54.217 --> 06:55.693
Yeah, no, here, look.

06:55.776 --> 06:57.852
Here, this is my license, see?

06:57.888 --> 07:00.503
I-I know it says "Nicholas"
on the license, but...

07:00.647 --> 07:02.683
my publishers had change it
to "Nicholson,"

07:02.696 --> 07:05.482
- 'cause they thought it sounded more...
- importante.

07:06.517 --> 07:07.600
Exactly.

07:09.267 --> 07:10.331
Come in.

07:12.005 --> 07:13.063
Gracias.

07:16.226 --> 07:19.370
I wrote the book here, right here,
three years ago

07:19.806 --> 07:21.772
over one long winter.
Oh, man.

07:21.906 --> 07:24.271
So, um, you write another book?

07:24.587 --> 07:27.790
- Not so much.
- Ah... you got the, um,

07:28.226 --> 07:29.372
the writer block.

07:29.777 --> 07:31.470
Yeah, something like that.

07:32.006 --> 07:33.320
You could write it here.

07:33.967 --> 07:35.402
Shhh.

07:35.507 --> 07:38.003
- Really?
- My grandmother had a saying.

07:38.107 --> 07:42.473
"Es el tonto que no puede volver
al lugar de su felicidad pasada."

07:43.407 --> 07:48.153
"It is the fool who fails to return
to the place of his last happiness."

07:51.477 --> 07:53.332
Hey, Bennett, it's me!

07:53.607 --> 07:55.431
I'm gonna do it.
I'll do it.

07:55.615 --> 07:58.002
The 1-day intensive at Dufresne College.

07:59.388 --> 08:02.883
I suddenly feel imbued with, uh, uh...

08:03.206 --> 08:04.342
possibility.

08:57.308 --> 08:58.993
What kind of mulch do you want?

08:59.506 --> 09:01.263
Cedar or hardwood dark?

09:01.675 --> 09:02.932
It doesn't really matter.

09:02.947 --> 09:04.942
The glorioso house got a lot of inclines.

09:04.958 --> 09:07.193
Cedar stays in place better
on inclines, don't it?

09:07.588 --> 09:08.733
I suppose.

09:11.006 --> 09:12.130
What's wrong with you?

09:12.217 --> 09:13.781
I think I'm sick of mulch.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.563
Maybe you should go
into another line of work.

09:16.825 --> 09:17.982
I saw an ad.

09:18.447 --> 09:21.603
Fortune 500 companies are looking
for you if you're smart,

09:21.616 --> 09:25.291
handsome, charming and highly
skilled at drinking beer,

09:25.306 --> 09:29.092
bullying college kids and having sex
with girls you don't really like.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.112
You're an idiot, Ikey.

09:56.967 --> 09:58.840
That house is haunted.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.862
You ever seen "to kill a mockingbird"?

10:02.706 --> 10:04.342
You know that Boo Radley guy?

10:04.995 --> 10:08.953
In that house, there's Boo Radley Sr.
And Boo Radley Jr.

10:09.435 --> 10:10.970
I know.
I grew up there.

10:11.096 --> 10:12.202
What do you mean?

10:12.246 --> 10:15.042
I mean, Boo Radley Sr. is my father,

10:15.055 --> 10:17.452
and Boo Radley Jr. is my brother.

10:20.007 --> 10:21.100
Sorry.

10:21.307 --> 10:23.221
- You live on this street?
- No.

10:23.347 --> 10:24.940
My friend Doodie does, though.

10:24.952 --> 10:28.190
He moved here a while ago,
but it was hard for him to make friends

10:28.204 --> 10:31.051
on account of...
Well, let's just put it this way.

10:31.312 --> 10:34.044
They had to burn down the school
to get him out of third grade.

10:34.059 --> 10:35.361
Catch my drift?

10:36.338 --> 10:40.072
Doodie... this guy grew up there
with Freddy K. and leatherface.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.331
You're the writer dude.

10:42.867 --> 10:44.062
That's right.

10:44.116 --> 10:45.541
My mom read your book.

10:45.796 --> 10:47.750
She said it was mostly crap.

10:48.485 --> 10:49.532
Told you.

10:49.675 --> 10:51.082
He's Lenny to my George.

10:51.635 --> 10:55.022
It wasn't George, you dope.
It was squiggy!

10:57.116 --> 10:58.312
See you kids later.

10:59.008 --> 11:00.013
See ya.

11:16.406 --> 11:18.600
Ronny didn't tell you
I was coming home?

11:19.095 --> 11:20.890
No, no.

11:21.856 --> 11:24.441
The long-term effects
of marijuana and video games

11:24.458 --> 11:26.480
have affected him in the short-term.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.371
What are you doing here?

11:35.727 --> 11:38.301
Teaching a thing tomorrow at the doof.

11:38.317 --> 11:39.750
- Oh.
- Yeah.

11:40.207 --> 11:43.501
I was thinking I could crash here
for the weekend?

11:44.775 --> 11:46.843
- Oh...
- What?

11:47.326 --> 11:49.572
Your room--it changed.

11:59.406 --> 12:01.713
We got a routine here, your brother and me.

12:02.565 --> 12:04.823
We get up. He makes the coffee.
I fry the eggs.

12:04.838 --> 12:06.503
We go to work. We come home.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.532
He makes the coffee,
and I fry the pork chops.

12:09.795 --> 12:13.071
Sittin' here, a few beers,
watch a game, maybe a movie.

12:13.457 --> 12:16.020
It ain't much, but it works.

12:18.607 --> 12:19.722
Nicky!

12:20.085 --> 12:21.470
Ronny!

12:22.208 --> 12:25.311
You're pretty happy to see him for a guy
who forgot he was coming home.

12:30.305 --> 12:31.871
Ooh, there he is.

12:33.105 --> 12:34.120
Nicky!

12:35.357 --> 12:36.731
- Owen Rowan!
- Hey there!

12:36.735 --> 12:38.153
Hey, man.
I know we're a little late,

12:38.158 --> 12:40.310
but it takes a village to get
this group to the village.

12:40.315 --> 12:41.802
Well, thanks for meeting me here, man.

12:41.808 --> 12:45.302
Oh, sure, sure.
Uh, Nicky, this is my wife Alison.

12:46.005 --> 12:48.693
- Ally, the great Nicky Garrett.
- It's really nice to meet you.

12:48.755 --> 12:51.042
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Uh, hey, kids...

12:51.377 --> 12:53.583
say hello to your uncle Nicky.

12:53.608 --> 12:55.642
- This is Caitlin.
- Hey!

12:56.008 --> 12:59.122
And, uh, this little boy is Connor.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.783
- Kids, wow.
- Connor, stay!

13:02.166 --> 13:03.553
I'll--I'll get him.

13:03.606 --> 13:06.100
It's okay. You guys grap a coffee, okay?
See you at home.

13:06.938 --> 13:08.380
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

13:10.307 --> 13:11.983
Wow, Owen Rowan, she's hot.

13:12.048 --> 13:13.202
Crazy, right?

13:13.507 --> 13:15.372
- It's good to see you, buddy.
- You, too, man.

13:15.906 --> 13:16.922
Hey, uh...

13:17.117 --> 13:20.472
I gotta say thanks for going
easy on me in the book.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.803
At first I was insulted, 'cause,
you know, the...

13:23.838 --> 13:25.953
Kevin Levin guy was barely in it.

13:25.975 --> 13:30.073
But then I read how you made Eddie
and Hannah look, and I was like "phew."

13:30.087 --> 13:32.703
- Phew point-five, right?
- Well, no, look, I just...

13:32.907 --> 13:35.280
want to say sorry
in case I hurt you in any way.

13:35.308 --> 13:37.193
The only way you could hurt me,
buddy boy,

13:37.206 --> 13:39.843
is by taking the cheese
out of my doodles,

13:40.207 --> 13:42.623
- but, Eddie, let me tell you--
- Yeah, I know, I know.

13:43.107 --> 13:44.293
Big cat...

13:45.066 --> 13:47.843
Ray Cataldo, how you doing?

13:48.506 --> 13:53.700
Well, I mean, I'm not famous like you,
but uh, I am rich.

13:54.087 --> 13:55.731
Big cat's the man now, Nicky.

13:56.005 --> 13:57.853
- Concrete castle king.
- Well...

13:57.868 --> 14:01.202
Puttin' up coffee shops and juice bars and pizza barns,

14:01.235 --> 14:02.443
all over the ridge.

14:02.455 --> 14:05.641
Look, Garrett, I ain't gonna ask
why you felt the need to drop turds

14:05.656 --> 14:07.893
all over your hometown.
I mean, that's your business, right?

14:08.096 --> 14:11.400
What I do want to know--
what's with the Nicholson thing?

14:12.405 --> 14:16.900
Well, I guess some people thought
it sounded importante.

14:17.447 --> 14:19.523
Huh, well...

14:20.726 --> 14:24.140
- these your kids?
- Yep, thursdays and every other weekend.

14:24.185 --> 14:28.012
Mom's a cobra, but she did give me
two sons and no daughters,

14:28.107 --> 14:32.092
which means I only have to worry
about two penises instead of a thousand.

14:35.777 --> 14:36.971
Have fun, Garrett.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.073
What?

14:39.306 --> 14:43.331
Ten years after high school,
the guy still makes me nervous.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.633
- Hey, kid.
- Hey.

14:47.778 --> 14:49.012
What are you doing here?

14:49.456 --> 14:51.892
- I'm here with my mom.
- You two know each other?

14:51.916 --> 14:54.212
- Yeah.
- Oh, boy.

14:55.075 --> 14:57.700
- What's wrong?
- Stay tuned.

15:12.386 --> 15:13.782
Hello, Hannah.

15:16.708 --> 15:20.363
I... I didn't know you were back.

15:21.577 --> 15:26.461
I was gonna call, but this was all
kinda... last minute.

15:28.105 --> 15:30.522
Whatever you two have going on with each other,

15:30.557 --> 15:34.820
why don't I delicately extract myself
and order us some dagwoods?

15:34.975 --> 15:36.322
I'll go with you.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.502
He's pretty amazing-- your son.

15:42.635 --> 15:44.911
Yeah, just don't call him precocious.
He hates that.

15:44.928 --> 15:47.421
He prefers "wise beyond his years."

15:47.736 --> 15:49.710
- So you're a mom, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

15:49.755 --> 15:52.660
Wow, I just... I didn't know that.

15:52.678 --> 15:55.692
Well, there's a lot of things you miss
when you vanish into the ether.

15:55.708 --> 15:57.143
Yeah.

15:57.598 --> 15:59.620
You've been gone how long now?

15:59.805 --> 16:01.222
Ten years.

16:02.107 --> 16:03.093
Right.

16:03.208 --> 16:06.222
I think it was 2 weeks before
my 18th birthday that you left.

16:06.768 --> 16:09.460
Yes, I'm quite sure of it, 'cause
I remember getting those roses

16:09.475 --> 16:11.591
and thinking they were
for my birthday.

16:11.708 --> 16:13.042
But they weren't.

16:13.115 --> 16:14.343
They were a good-bye present,

16:14.358 --> 16:16.570
as in : "good-bye, I am no longer
in your present."

16:16.587 --> 16:18.700
- I can explain.
- It's not necessary.

16:18.778 --> 16:22.311
- Hannah--
- Nick, truly, don't sweat it.

16:23.408 --> 16:24.533
I should go.

16:27.406 --> 16:30.110
Um, are you... are you staying long?

16:30.256 --> 16:31.591
Leave sunday.

16:35.908 --> 16:37.172
How old is Sam ?

16:39.308 --> 16:41.170
He turns 10 in 2 months.

16:42.987 --> 16:43.843
10?

16:44.005 --> 16:45.040
10.

16:47.016 --> 16:48.803
- Yeah.
- See you, Sam.

16:49.108 --> 16:50.110
See ya.

16:50.568 --> 16:51.732
See you around.

16:53.406 --> 16:56.883
Good-bye, Nick... and good luck.

17:05.208 --> 17:07.212
And don't worry.

17:08.215 --> 17:09.653
He's not yours.

17:48.457 --> 17:51.530
We've got a great crowd, Nicholson.
You're quite a draw.

17:51.555 --> 17:54.870
We're all looking forward
to whatever you have prepared.

17:54.886 --> 17:56.183
Can you give me one second?

17:56.195 --> 17:57.722
- Yeah, fine.
- Thanks.

17:59.007 --> 17:59.752
Yeah?

17:59.807 --> 18:03.152
Doctor, Taylor told me where you are.
What's wrong with you?

18:03.177 --> 18:06.040
You can't go home again.
Everybody knows that.

18:06.056 --> 18:08.850
Norman Rockwell is dead.
Spread the word.

18:08.908 --> 18:10.703
- I can't talk now, Stratt.
- Why not ?

18:10.706 --> 18:14.430
- This conversation's in diapers.
- I gotta go, okay? I gotta go.

18:30.905 --> 18:31.942
Is this on?

18:33.808 --> 18:34.973
Hello.

18:35.327 --> 18:36.573
Dufresne...

18:43.865 --> 18:45.121
these, uh...

18:47.098 --> 18:51.043
these aren't really gonna work. Um...

18:54.976 --> 18:56.212
Okay.

18:57.707 --> 18:59.473
Are there any questions?

19:35.666 --> 19:37.642
What are you doing here
in the middle of the day?

19:38.138 --> 19:39.262
I don't know.

19:39.305 --> 19:41.620
I just, um, went for a walk.

19:41.908 --> 19:43.160
You want something?

19:44.156 --> 19:45.750
Anything with vodka.

19:52.947 --> 19:54.960
- Nick is back.
- I know.

19:55.287 --> 19:59.120
After ten years and not a single phone call
to anyone but his brother or father.

19:59.438 --> 20:02.851
I saw him... at Murph's.

20:04.605 --> 20:05.661
How was that?

20:07.027 --> 20:09.840
I felt like I was 18 all over again.

20:10.815 --> 20:12.493
How'd you feel when you were 18?

20:17.458 --> 20:18.502
Scared.

20:34.405 --> 20:35.790
The others left.

20:36.127 --> 20:37.171
How come?

20:38.587 --> 20:39.702
I don't know.

20:39.895 --> 20:42.341
Uh, I guess they still cling to the antiquated notion

20:42.345 --> 20:47.423
that it's difficult to learn from a teacher
who has fled the room in panic.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.511
I never read your book.

20:53.505 --> 20:54.602
Fair enough.

20:55.407 --> 20:56.661
What's your name?

20:57.308 --> 20:58.420
Aubrey.

20:58.626 --> 20:59.702
Nick.

21:00.406 --> 21:01.483
I know.

21:01.707 --> 21:05.192
I would have introduced myself
at the start of the class, but...

21:05.208 --> 21:07.480
my throat tightened up
the size of a pinhole,

21:07.505 --> 21:09.110
and I was covered in flop-sweat.

21:10.165 --> 21:12.331
I thought somebody slipped me a peanut.

21:12.378 --> 21:13.652
A peanut?

21:13.957 --> 21:16.601
All the Garrett men suffer
from nut allergies,

21:16.616 --> 21:20.271
dating back to my great-great-great
grandfather James Joseph Garrett,

21:20.286 --> 21:24.653
who was tragically felled
in the civil war by a cashew.

21:24.708 --> 21:27.640
So the peanut-allergy-related death
of Sebastian Grace

21:27.647 --> 21:30.921
was more than just
a convenient plot contrivance?

21:30.938 --> 21:33.801
- Thought you didn't read it.
- Uh, no, no, I didn't.

21:33.836 --> 21:39.181
The guy upstairs-- he has the audio book
as read by Johnny Depp.

21:39.256 --> 21:42.043
Played it all night long.
Crazy annoying.

21:42.185 --> 21:43.603
Nice try.

21:43.977 --> 21:45.961
That's what we call a swing and a miss.

21:46.215 --> 21:49.120
Putting it in line with the theme
of the afternoon, right?

21:49.717 --> 21:54.471
Which begs the question,
why did you run out of here?

21:55.277 --> 21:56.991
I'm not sure why.

21:57.778 --> 22:02.202
I looked out at all those faces,
expecting answers,

22:02.225 --> 22:05.901
and I realized that I can't
impart wisdom. I cant...

22:06.916 --> 22:08.403
inspire.

22:10.206 --> 22:12.063
Then what are you doing here?

22:26.226 --> 22:27.360
Eddie?

22:29.605 --> 22:30.740
Hello, Eddie?

22:33.108 --> 22:35.221
There he is! Ha ha!

22:35.236 --> 22:37.543
- Physical Phil!
- Hey, man.

22:38.076 --> 22:39.600
God, it's good to see you.

22:39.635 --> 22:41.972
- Hey, how you been, man?
- Good, good.

22:41.985 --> 22:44.522
- Look at you.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:44.526 --> 22:46.462
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:46.476 --> 22:47.933
Look, first things first,

22:48.128 --> 22:50.490
- about the book...
- Oh, no, no, no worries.

22:50.505 --> 22:53.240
- I mean...
- I don't room in my heart for anger.

22:53.517 --> 22:55.663
- I gotta warn you, though, Eddie--
- Yeah, I heard.

22:55.677 --> 22:57.643
I really got to talk to him, too.
Is he around?

22:57.646 --> 23:00.090
No.
Hey, come on in.

23:02.177 --> 23:03.363
Wow.

23:04.306 --> 23:05.871
So what have you been up to, man?

23:06.037 --> 23:08.473
- You--you haven't heard?
- Heard what? No.

23:08.518 --> 23:10.801
I haven't left this house in five years.

23:10.936 --> 23:12.230
Five years?

23:16.705 --> 23:17.722
Why not?

23:17.735 --> 23:20.043
You remember when
the twin towers were hit,

23:20.058 --> 23:22.131
how everyone went into lockdown,

23:22.146 --> 23:26.340
glued themselves to their tvs,
just us and Peter Jennings,

23:26.358 --> 23:29.373
taking the nation through it all,
rock steady like he was?

23:29.406 --> 23:32.670
But then by, like, september 15th,
most everyone got up,

23:32.706 --> 23:35.222
went back to their normal routines.

23:35.896 --> 23:37.031
Not me.

23:37.388 --> 23:39.812
Homeboy stayed on the couch.

23:40.476 --> 23:41.483
Why?

23:41.488 --> 23:44.671
The way I see it,
I got everything I need right here.

23:44.707 --> 23:47.610
I order out for grub.
I got the phone for chitchat.

23:47.825 --> 23:50.003
Entertainment and info from the tube.

23:50.218 --> 23:53.181
- And then came the ipod and tivo!
- Oh...

23:53.708 --> 23:57.303
I mean, as if to further assure
I maintain my position on the couch.

23:57.317 --> 24:01.820
And the best part is, that's guaranteed
reliability for my friends, my loved ones.

24:02.528 --> 24:05.242
- Yeah.
- It's dangerous out there, man.

24:06.505 --> 24:08.952
There's a car outside
with New York plates.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.272
- Let's slash the tires!
- Ikey!

24:11.275 --> 24:12.623
- Nicky G.!
- Oh!

24:13.315 --> 24:14.483
- Look at him!
- Ah!

24:16.708 --> 24:18.081
- I got a bone to pick.
- What?

24:18.105 --> 24:19.433
I read your book three times.

24:19.445 --> 24:22.081
I still can't figure out
which character is supposed to be me.

24:22.505 --> 24:25.170
That's 'cause there wasn't
a character based on you.

24:26.045 --> 24:27.193
Well, now I'm really pissed!

24:27.208 --> 24:28.840
All right, you know what?
It's official.

24:28.856 --> 24:31.512
If I had a time machine,
I wouldn't kill Hitler.

24:31.626 --> 24:33.611
I wouldn't stop Lee Harvey Oswald.

24:33.625 --> 24:36.971
I would go back three years to the exact
moment I started writing this book,

24:36.987 --> 24:38.190
and I'd stop myself.

24:38.208 --> 24:42.040
I'd go back to the day little Halle Berry
learned that boys didn't have cooties.

24:42.105 --> 24:45.901
- Or that.
- Come on, hey, it's time.

24:49.987 --> 24:51.971
- What are you guys doing?
- It's 3:00 on saturday.

24:51.986 --> 24:54.250
- What do you think we're doing?
- Jamming, soldier.

24:54.265 --> 24:58.451
- Don't tell me you guys still do this.
- This is yours.

25:00.806 --> 25:04.101
- You held on to this?
- I knew you couldn't stay away forever.

25:04.205 --> 25:06.303
Although you did
a hell of a job of trying.

25:06.316 --> 25:07.331
Ten years.

25:07.346 --> 25:09.532
- What were you doing?
- Hey, forget about that, Ikey.

25:09.536 --> 25:13.112
What's important is, we finally
got the band back together.

25:13.205 --> 25:16.341
No, we did not get
the band back together.

25:24.808 --> 25:27.822
# Guess who just got back today? #

25:27.846 --> 25:30.783
# Them wild-eyed boys that had been away#

25:31.186 --> 25:33.662
# haven't changed, haven't much to say #

25:33.847 --> 25:37.172
# but, man, I still think them
cats are crazy #

25:46.467 --> 25:49.190
# you know that chick
that used to dance a lot #

25:49.406 --> 25:52.490
# every night she'd be on the floor shakin' what she'd got #

25:52.506 --> 25:55.430
# man, when I tell you she was cool,
she was red hot #

25:55.448 --> 25:57.961
# I mean, she was steaming... #

26:00.856 --> 26:02.140
Dorks.

26:03.766 --> 26:06.220
# If that chick don't want to know,
forget her #

26:06.765 --> 26:10.253
# the boys are back in town,
the boys are back in town #

26:31.108 --> 26:32.110
So how's work?

26:32.207 --> 26:34.551
Ah, same.
It's a delivery truck.

26:41.998 --> 26:43.060
Hey, Ronny.

26:43.565 --> 26:45.051
You know Hannah's son?

26:45.406 --> 26:46.891
All right, I met him yesterday.

26:47.007 --> 26:48.711
I can't help but do the math.

26:48.725 --> 26:49.941
The kid's 10.

26:50.336 --> 26:54.213
- I left 10 years ago. The way it adds up--
- No, no sale, no.

26:54.307 --> 26:57.572
Some... some guy from Boston's the dad.

26:57.857 --> 26:59.111
Uh, older guy.

26:59.205 --> 27:01.113
Grad student from B.C., I think.

27:01.276 --> 27:04.650
She hooked up with him a couple
weeks after you left for Europe,

27:04.748 --> 27:06.443
but he's--he's gone now.

27:07.007 --> 27:07.903
Hey.

27:07.977 --> 27:10.200
- How come you never told me?
- I don't know!

27:11.146 --> 27:12.931
I didn't want to hurt your feelings,
I guess.

27:12.947 --> 27:15.590
It's not really the kind of news
that you drop over the phone.

27:18.535 --> 27:20.501
Boston grabs control and
dumps it out of their end.

27:20.507 --> 27:25.513
500, 501, 502... 503, 504...
505, 506..

27:33.507 --> 27:34.503
Hey.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.481
Dude! Oh, my god.

27:37.305 --> 27:40.040
- You scared me!
- I'm sorry. I was in the neighborhood.

27:40.807 --> 27:41.971
Your parents still live here?

27:42.008 --> 27:44.132
They moved to the cape five years ago.

27:44.738 --> 27:46.113
It's just me and Sam now.

27:46.125 --> 27:49.741
You know it's still 547 steps
from my house to your house?

27:49.757 --> 27:51.300
You thought it might be different?

27:51.387 --> 27:54.470
Well, I tried to take into account
the increase in stride length, but...

27:54.558 --> 27:57.602
my stride,
kind of like everything else in my life,

27:57.605 --> 27:59.161
appears to have stagnated.

27:59.207 --> 28:01.642
Poor little super-successful writer boy.

28:01.658 --> 28:03.473
No, I just... hey.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.261
I just meant this place--
No, you had it in your head.

28:05.265 --> 28:06.742
I'm sure that it remained

28:06.835 --> 28:09.270
frozen in amber
just the way you left it,

28:09.276 --> 28:12.373
and that was probably wicked reassuring

28:12.685 --> 28:15.931
that you could go and do and see, and...

28:15.946 --> 28:18.140
things would just stay the same here.

28:19.795 --> 28:23.030
But things change, Nick,
even in the ridge.

28:23.476 --> 28:24.830
Why, the other night, we had a big rally

28:24.845 --> 28:27.341
where we burned all of
our reo speedwagon records.

28:27.356 --> 28:28.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:28.606 --> 28:30.463
It would have made a really
good scene for your book.

28:30.805 --> 28:32.381
Look, about that...

28:32.626 --> 28:33.602
Hannah...

28:36.457 --> 28:39.082
No, I loved it, truly.

28:39.086 --> 28:41.461
But tell me, when you came up
with the character,

28:41.476 --> 28:45.541
the pathetic hometown girl left behind,
did you have to name her Anna?

28:45.557 --> 28:48.731
- Anna is not you--
- Page 44, third paragraph.

28:48.748 --> 28:50.203
I committed it to memory.

28:50.218 --> 28:53.782
"Anna possessed the faded blue
sadness of a Roy Orbison song,

28:53.808 --> 28:55.802
"the kind of gal who was
quite sure one day

28:55.895 --> 28:57.993
"Richard Gere would come by
in his dress-whites,

28:58.005 --> 29:01.320
"pick her up and carry her out
of this factory girl existence."

29:02.575 --> 29:04.412
It sounds like you nailed me to a click.

29:04.575 --> 29:05.711
It's a book.

29:05.847 --> 29:06.902
Okay? I-I just wrote it.

29:07.008 --> 29:09.513
I didn't think anybody
would actually publish it.

29:09.856 --> 29:11.753
And when they did,
I tried to change the names.

29:11.755 --> 29:13.081
They wouldn't have it.

29:13.537 --> 29:15.823
For that, I am truly sorry, Hannah.

29:18.378 --> 29:21.150
But, by the way, who doesn't love
"an officer and a gentleman," huh?

29:23.808 --> 29:24.882
Where's Sam?

29:25.227 --> 29:28.171
Doing his homework,
which takes him all of 11 minutes.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.933
After seeing you at the sub shop,
his new fascination is my past.

29:31.948 --> 29:34.161
Yeah, I kind of wanted
to talk to you about--

29:41.607 --> 29:43.620
- Surprised, Garrett?
- Shocked...

29:44.095 --> 29:47.342
to a stupefying silence
that I may never recover from is...

29:47.376 --> 29:49.213
probably a better way to describe it.

29:49.227 --> 29:51.963
There's kind of a limited menu
here in the ridge.

29:51.976 --> 29:55.422
Oh, that's right, baby,
and I'm the pizza supreme.

29:55.468 --> 29:59.630
Wow, Ray, now anybody else
in your shoes would say,

29:59.668 --> 30:03.641
"I'm the filet mignon" or
"I'm the chateaubriand for two" or "the...

30:04.175 --> 30:07.560
lobster thermidor gratineed
in its shell," but no, Ray, to you,

30:07.577 --> 30:10.880
the culinary zenith
is the pizza supreme.

30:10.996 --> 30:13.583
Shut up.
Man, you talk too much.

30:13.638 --> 30:15.403
I gotta go with big cat on that one.

30:15.777 --> 30:17.021
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:17.497 --> 30:19.353
I'm gonna wash up for supper.

30:19.808 --> 30:21.022
Later, Garrett.

30:21.625 --> 30:22.752
Big cat...

30:25.106 --> 30:27.131
"lobster thermidor
gratineed in its shell"?

30:27.146 --> 30:28.502
Hey, I am not apologizing.

30:28.515 --> 30:30.841
You're the one that's kissing
"big cat" Cataldo.

30:30.857 --> 30:33.570
Well, it's like I said, Nick.
Things change.

30:34.055 --> 30:35.093
Yeah.

30:39.586 --> 30:40.621
Take care.

30:41.116 --> 30:42.161
You, too.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.480
They are in there.
Just follow the splashing.

31:01.507 --> 31:03.213
- Thanks.
- Shark attack!

31:07.786 --> 31:09.712
Where's my boat?
Where's my boat?

31:09.808 --> 31:11.492
Where's my boat?
Did you sink it?

31:11.656 --> 31:13.741
I got the ducky with me.
Ducky's coming.

31:13.758 --> 31:14.880
Aah, Connor!

31:15.155 --> 31:18.300
My fish man will get you.
I want Connor!

31:18.425 --> 31:20.171
I'm gonna eat Connor!

31:24.005 --> 31:25.940
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, fellas.

31:25.957 --> 31:27.533
- Remember Nicky?
- Mm-hmm.

31:27.655 --> 31:29.920
Connor just sank my last destroyer.

31:31.405 --> 31:33.960
Ah. This is why you do it, Nicky.

31:34.388 --> 31:35.253
Yep.

31:35.266 --> 31:37.852
Daddy's gonna go out for the night,
okay?

31:44.916 --> 31:46.443
Yeah, I'll be there in a sec.

31:49.208 --> 31:52.802
Hey! I don't think you and Ian
have been formally introduced.

31:53.005 --> 31:54.141
Nick, nice to meet you.

31:54.147 --> 31:56.263
Ian's as close to the next big thing as there is here.

31:56.275 --> 31:58.770
- His writing-- straight stoops.
- Not really.

31:58.785 --> 32:02.952
But "turtle"ruly made me see,
uh, what could be done.

32:03.605 --> 32:07.610
Can I ask you, um, did you intend
a deeper allegorical nihilism

32:07.627 --> 32:09.781
when you set the last chapter
at ground zero?

32:09.795 --> 32:12.122
Uh, well, you know,
a lot of people read it that way,

32:12.138 --> 32:15.660
but I just thought it was
the manifestation of his larger issue,

32:15.677 --> 32:20.511
which was how do you reconcile
the past with the present,

32:20.527 --> 32:23.181
when you don't really feel
comfortable in either one?

32:32.655 --> 32:34.322
Will you excuse me?

32:37.507 --> 32:38.470
Hey!

32:38.966 --> 32:40.401
Big Nicky G.!

32:44.028 --> 32:45.401
Long time, Eddie.

32:50.108 --> 32:51.022
Check it!

32:51.536 --> 32:52.600
Janet the planet.

32:53.016 --> 32:55.142
I mean, at what point did
she just give up the fight and go,

32:55.147 --> 32:58.422
"bacon burger 1, Janet the planet 0,"
you know?

33:02.856 --> 33:06.022
Hey, Ikey, what do you even
know about Janet?

33:07.257 --> 33:09.941
She may be the coolest person
in this bar, but you'll never find out,

33:09.958 --> 33:12.421
because you're too busy
judging her from the outside,

33:12.865 --> 33:14.961
instead of finding out
what's on the inside.

33:15.458 --> 33:16.373
All right.

33:16.387 --> 33:18.902
Maybe I should find out
what's on the inside.

33:19.957 --> 33:22.292
My guess is cake, lots of cake.

33:27.545 --> 33:29.150
I'm gonna get some shots.

33:30.915 --> 33:32.471
I gotta hang a rat.

33:36.505 --> 33:37.602
That wasn't too bad.

33:37.617 --> 33:40.271
- Maybe he ain't still so creased.
- Yeah.

33:41.207 --> 33:42.340
Thanks.

33:47.588 --> 33:49.383
I gotta drop something on ya, Nicky.

33:49.546 --> 33:51.452
I hate doing this to you,
but I gotta tell someone.

33:51.465 --> 33:52.990
- I'm bustin' out.
- What's wrong, man?

33:54.758 --> 33:57.322
- You meet Alison yet?
- What, Owen Rowan's wife?

33:57.368 --> 33:59.362
Yeah, what about her?

34:02.407 --> 34:04.110
- I had sex with her.
- What?

34:04.125 --> 34:06.890
Yeah, Ducky Lowe had a party.

34:07.057 --> 34:08.811
Owen got boomered and passed out.

34:08.826 --> 34:09.969
She got mad.

34:10.176 --> 34:13.393
- I gave her a ride home, and then--
- Ikey...

34:14.377 --> 34:15.940
it was a 1-shot thing.

34:16.145 --> 34:17.851
It'll never happen again.

34:18.725 --> 34:20.123
And that's the gong.

34:22.565 --> 34:24.989
I might have had the most
intense moment of my life

34:25.105 --> 34:27.141
with someone I can
never be with again.

34:28.206 --> 34:29.540
Why am I hearing this?

34:29.628 --> 34:31.902
'Cause you're leaving town tomorrow.

34:31.916 --> 34:33.500
We probably won't see you
for another ten years.

34:33.507 --> 34:35.150
Well, shut it down, man.

34:35.797 --> 34:38.001
He's got a life, a family.

34:38.405 --> 34:40.572
- Score for you, buddy.
- All right!

34:40.587 --> 34:43.031
Eichorn loves nuts more
than most squirrels do, Nicky.

34:43.047 --> 34:44.793
- Want some?
- No, no, no, no.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.170
Don't you remember, Ikey?

34:46.436 --> 34:49.721
"All of the Garrett men
suffer from nut allergies."

34:49.735 --> 34:51.841
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.130
What'd you call me, college boy?

34:54.148 --> 34:55.752
- I didn't say anything.
- Where are you going, huh?

34:55.766 --> 34:58.080
- Eddie, stop it!
- Where are you going?

34:58.095 --> 34:59.250
You're not such a smart-ass now,
are you?

34:59.255 --> 35:01.022
Why don't you come back to the table, man?
Calm down, all right?

35:01.026 --> 35:02.433
Is that right, huh?

35:02.445 --> 35:04.272
Is that who you are now?
Defender of the doofs?

35:04.277 --> 35:06.841
Look, I know I got a lot to set
right by you, but this is crazy.

35:06.858 --> 35:08.341
I don't know what you're talking
about, Nicholson.

35:08.357 --> 35:11.550
What I do know is in your big,
triumphant return,

35:11.575 --> 35:15.101
you seem to have forgotten which
side of October Road you belong on.

35:15.127 --> 35:17.812
Well, I'm gonna remind you
how we roll here in the ridge.

35:17.825 --> 35:20.483
- It ain't much, but it's tight.
- Let him go!

35:20.485 --> 35:22.431
Hey, stop it!
Come on!

35:22.507 --> 35:24.662
No, Nicky. No, I won't.

35:37.005 --> 35:39.110
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.672
Look, it was just one of those
friendly misunderstandings

35:42.676 --> 35:44.203
that got out of hand, you know?

35:44.325 --> 35:46.200
Yeah, just take him home, okay?

35:46.318 --> 35:49.043
I mean, I've got no need
to bring Eddie Latekka in.

35:50.186 --> 35:52.192
He was my Q.B.
My sophomore year.

35:52.405 --> 35:53.802
He threw me the ball a lot.

35:54.205 --> 35:56.272
All right, I appreciate it.

36:24.218 --> 36:26.613
Look, I really am sorry, Eddie.

36:27.628 --> 36:31.503
I never thought anybody would get
torn up in the process, especially you.

36:33.948 --> 36:38.301
I left you that summer with every
intention of coming back to the ridge.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.700
But on the last night of the trip,

36:42.516 --> 36:45.321
I'm literally packing my bags, and...

36:45.628 --> 36:49.221
I remembered something
ma told me before she died.

36:50.305 --> 36:54.000
She said, "you gotta promise me, Nicky,

36:54.056 --> 36:58.812
"never to settle for anything less
than the unexpected adventure."

36:59.145 --> 37:02.810
Yeah, and I couldn't kick the feeling
that if I came back here,

37:03.106 --> 37:04.661
I'd be giving up on that.

37:05.006 --> 37:07.201
It's like once I stayed away,

37:08.455 --> 37:10.910
staying away became the way.

37:13.095 --> 37:14.842
Any of this make sense?

37:29.206 --> 37:31.141
I really missed you, man.

37:46.757 --> 37:47.983
Good night, buddy.

37:49.156 --> 37:50.723
But I can never...

37:51.655 --> 37:53.972
never, ever be your friend again.

39:12.357 --> 39:16.310
Hey... what are you doing, kid?

39:16.756 --> 39:20.101
- You got a paper route?
- Yeah, ma feels it's good for me.

39:20.156 --> 39:23.820
Crack of dawn, fresh air, current events.

39:24.707 --> 39:26.263
Character-building stuff.

39:26.458 --> 39:28.202
What are you doing up this early?

39:29.186 --> 39:31.682
Same thing.
Trying to build some character.

39:33.157 --> 39:34.832
Hey, let me ask you a question.

39:35.596 --> 39:37.631
What do you think
about your mom's boyfriend?

39:37.855 --> 39:39.563
- Big cat?
- Yeah.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.621
He's okay, I guess.

39:41.647 --> 39:46.062
Although... sometimes
I think he's trying to murder me.

39:46.746 --> 39:49.031
- What do you mean?
- He makes my lunches,

39:49.386 --> 39:53.363
which is nice,
I suppose, but he forgets.

39:56.257 --> 39:58.492
Yep. He did it again.

39:58.685 --> 39:59.902
What did he do?

40:00.467 --> 40:02.940
He made me a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich,

40:03.658 --> 40:06.240
only I got this peanut allergy.

40:06.245 --> 40:08.691
One bite of this puppy,
and I'm a goner.

40:13.685 --> 40:14.843
You okay?

40:16.326 --> 40:17.351
Yeah.

40:18.206 --> 40:22.080
Sure.
I'm, uh, fine.

40:23.255 --> 40:24.321
Do you want this?

40:24.848 --> 40:27.073
- Uh, no, uh...
- You sure?

40:27.408 --> 40:28.991
It's... I'm not gonna eat it.

40:30.157 --> 40:31.473
I don't like jelly.

40:33.006 --> 40:34.112
Okay.

40:38.107 --> 40:40.561
Well, see you around.

40:42.508 --> 40:43.781
I'll see you around, Sam.

41:00.008 --> 41:02.350
You got Stratt.
Leave your peep at the beep.

41:02.587 --> 41:04.351
Hey, frenzy boy.
It's me.

41:05.356 --> 41:09.253
You're gonna hate this, but
I'm gonna hang in the ridge for a while.

41:09.266 --> 41:10.923
I know it sounds crazy.

41:11.587 --> 41:14.410
It's just... I was wrong all along,

41:14.675 --> 41:17.760
'cause there are a lot of
unexpected adventures here,

41:18.505 --> 41:22.580
and I'm just not ready to walk away,
not a second time.

41:23.955 --> 41:27.442
The way I see it,
this thing is in diapers.
