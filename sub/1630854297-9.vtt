WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:07.108
DANNY:
Ma'am, please,

00:07.208 --> 00:08.676
is there anything I can do

00:08.776 --> 00:10.111
to get you to reconsider?

00:10.211 --> 00:12.113
Please?

00:12.213 --> 00:13.781
Great, thanks for nothing.

00:13.881 --> 00:17.418
Our sole witness in the Bardo
murder will not testify now.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.852
Screwed on Upchurch, too.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.522
Ballistics don't match
the gun we recovered.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.057
Can't people just take a break
from killing each other

00:23.157 --> 00:25.559
long enough for us to catch up
on all these cases?

00:25.659 --> 00:27.095
Detective Reagan?
Not now, Meyers.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.729
We're swamped.
Danny.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.298
Says she's a
friend of yours.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.465
She is.
Thank you.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.466
Hey, Naomi.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.935
Detective Maria Baez,

00:35.035 --> 00:36.270
Naomi Dixon.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.871
I was her husband's
first partner when

00:37.971 --> 00:39.673
he got his gold shield.
One of my best partners ever.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.475
Uh, second to
you, of course.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.377
But, uh, I taught him
everything I know.
Oh.

00:43.477 --> 00:44.712
What'd that take-- five minutes?

00:44.812 --> 00:46.347
Very funny.
BAEZ: Nice to meet you, Naomi.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.981
You too.
You good?

00:48.849 --> 00:50.418
You're not good. Um,
why don't we go...
Can we talk?

00:50.518 --> 00:51.619
Yeah, of course.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.921
Uh, hold down
the fort, okay?

00:57.625 --> 00:59.160
What's going on?
Everything okay?

00:59.260 --> 01:00.928
(sighs)

01:01.028 --> 01:03.030
So, John's been
on an undercover assignment

01:03.131 --> 01:04.998
for the last few months.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.400
But he's in over his head.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.303
Is he in danger?
From who he's with?

01:09.403 --> 01:10.571
I don't know
a lot of the details.

01:10.671 --> 01:14.275
But he's just
not himself anymore.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.409
He drinks now.
Uh-huh.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.777
And yells at the kids

01:16.877 --> 01:18.946
and he stays out
for days on end.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.549
And last week
I caught him snorting cocaine.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.351
So, he's drinking and drugging?

01:23.451 --> 01:25.719
And he says, "Well, it's just
to fit in with the criminals."

01:25.819 --> 01:28.088
But all he cares about
is making this case

01:28.189 --> 01:30.358
and screw the rest of us.

01:31.159 --> 01:34.362
Look, you know I'd do
anything for you and John.

01:34.462 --> 01:37.631
This is probably something you
should address with his handler

01:37.731 --> 01:39.367
at the department.
And so he gets
thrown off the job

01:39.467 --> 01:40.634
and then he hates us even more?

01:40.734 --> 01:43.804
No, you have got to talk to him.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.206
You know he looks up to you.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.607
Naomi, I-I...

01:46.707 --> 01:50.378
Please, Danny.
He will listen to you.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.847
And this is our family.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.985
Okay.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.587
The Village People, really?

01:59.687 --> 02:02.590
Won our fifth-grade
talent show.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.793
What did you go as?
Please say Leatherman.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.161
The cop.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.596
Oh.
Girls went so wild
for me in uniform

02:08.696 --> 02:10.731
I knew I'd found
my calling.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.201
I learn something new
about you every day.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.502
Pretty cool, right?

02:14.602 --> 02:16.604
Didn't say that.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.239
Wallets out, partner.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.607
First rule of patrol:

02:19.707 --> 02:21.942
never pass up a kid
selling something homemade.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.811
Wouldn't dream of it.

02:23.911 --> 02:24.945
Hi.
Hi.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.013
Two cocoas, please.

02:26.113 --> 02:27.348
Do you want
a cookie too?

02:27.448 --> 02:29.149
I made oatmeal
and chocolate chip.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.618
Sold on both.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.453
JANKO: "All proceeds go
to my new puppy fund."

02:32.553 --> 02:34.054
Oh, no, did you
lose your dog?

02:34.154 --> 02:36.357
No, someone stole
Mr. Pickles last week.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.359
What?
I brought him out to pee

02:38.459 --> 02:40.694
and this guy
ran up and grabbed him.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.263
And I tried to hold on
to the leash,

02:42.363 --> 02:45.466
but he shoved me and drove off
in a red car with him.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.134
You called 911, right?
No.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.870
My dad said police
don't help people like us.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.440
That's not true.
What's your name?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.208
Elyse.
All right, Elyse,

02:54.308 --> 02:56.510
we're gonna take our cocoas
and our cookies

02:56.610 --> 02:59.913
and your statement on exactly
what happened with Mr. Pickles.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.951
Hello, neighbor.

03:05.018 --> 03:09.357
Henry. I didn't know
you shopped here.
When the sale is good.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.691
Though with prices these days,

03:10.791 --> 03:13.761
I may give up eating altogether.
(chuckles)

03:14.462 --> 03:15.396
You stocking up?

03:15.496 --> 03:16.697
Oh.

03:16.797 --> 03:17.798
These.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.468
These are just...
I-I mean, they...

03:20.568 --> 03:21.769
You mean what?

03:21.869 --> 03:23.471
How is your family?

03:23.571 --> 03:25.306
Donna, is everything okay?

03:25.406 --> 03:27.174
I can't buy a gift card?

03:27.275 --> 03:30.043
Look, did someone
ask you to buy these?

03:30.143 --> 03:31.078
I don't mean to pry...

03:31.178 --> 03:33.247
Then... don't.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.815
Donna.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.750
It's nice seeing you, Henry.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.860
JOE:
Hey.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.228
Hey.

03:48.329 --> 03:52.500
Figured I'd stop by,
wish my dad a happy birthday.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.468
Great minds.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.504
Except...

03:58.038 --> 03:59.640
Oh, my God.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.379
(sighs)

04:05.479 --> 04:07.648
This just ain't right.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.036
Okay.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.174
Joe.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.143
(panting)

04:39.980 --> 04:42.483
I'm gonna find whoever did this

04:42.583 --> 04:43.717
and I'm gonna bury them.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.885
I got this.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.954
I'll put Nuciforo
on it right away.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.022
You're gonna delegate this?

04:49.122 --> 04:50.290
This was my dad.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.892
And my son.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.329
Besides, you've got
a task force case to take down.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.964
How do you know that?

04:59.232 --> 05:00.668
I keep tabs on family.

05:00.768 --> 05:04.237
Helps me worry less, or...

05:04.338 --> 05:06.073
so I tell myself.
Well,

05:06.173 --> 05:08.342
I'll bang in sick.
This is way more important.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.213
I'd like to handle this.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.748
That an order?

05:14.848 --> 05:17.084
I'm asking.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.753
As his father.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.596
Sorry, Dad.

05:37.104 --> 05:40.173
* *

06:00.494 --> 06:01.662
But back then,
as your partner,

06:01.762 --> 06:03.497
John Dixon was
squared away?

06:03.597 --> 06:05.198
Yeah, he was a great guy.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.468
He was a hard charger,
like a Mini-Me.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.302
That's why we
clicked so well.

06:09.403 --> 06:10.738
That's him.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.641
Johnny Druhan!

06:14.775 --> 06:15.943
Danny?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.980
It's Detective Reagan and
my partner Detective Baez.

06:20.080 --> 06:20.981
Play along.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.283
So you know I'm under.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.118
Mr. Druhan, we understand
you were involved in

06:25.218 --> 06:27.821
a traffic accident
last Tuesday on the BQE?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.257
No, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:30.357 --> 06:33.160
Well, according to the
other driver, you do.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.962
We would have spoken
to you at home,

06:35.062 --> 06:36.329
but you're never
there anymore.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.567
Oh, geez. Naomi came to you?

06:39.667 --> 06:41.902
Yes, she's
worried about you.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.370
She doesn't get what we do.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.873
"We" don't do
cocaine, you do.

06:45.973 --> 06:49.209
You didn't, uh, you didn't
talk to my handler?

06:49.309 --> 06:50.878
Only to get the skinny
on this case.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.946
He knows nothing else.
Yet.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.415
Wait. So, what,
are you threatening...

06:55.516 --> 06:57.017
are you threatening
to pull me out right now?

06:57.117 --> 07:00.287
Damn right I am, you don't
get your ass under control.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.555
Now, let's go have
a cup of coffee

07:01.655 --> 07:02.823
and we can talk
about all of this.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.257
"All this"?
This is me doing my job,

07:04.357 --> 07:05.258
like you taught me to.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.393
Really?
Yeah.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.361
Like Naomi should understand.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.363
Crap.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.232
It's my boss.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.468
Relax.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.037
Keep it moving.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.606
Something wrong, Druhan?

07:18.706 --> 07:20.440
Hey. I said
keep it moving.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.342
He works for me. I get a say.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.677
Well, you know one
of your employees

07:23.777 --> 07:24.912
has a problem
with road rage, sir?
Hey,

07:25.012 --> 07:26.780
they're wrong, Bob, all right?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.381
Which I just told them.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.951
So unless you two have more
than somebody's word,

07:31.051 --> 07:32.986
this is where you screw off.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.456
Let's go

07:36.557 --> 07:39.226
Keep it under control,
Mr. Druhan.

07:40.093 --> 07:44.197
That's the guy
you showed the ropes?
Yeah.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.299
Once upon a time.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.335
Hey, boss, you got a minute?

07:48.435 --> 07:49.570
More like 30 seconds.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.804
Okay so here's the deal.
We're on patrol,

07:50.904 --> 07:52.573
we come across a girl
with a card table

07:52.673 --> 07:54.542
on the sidewalk, selling
hot cocoa and cookies.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.077
I got to say, the oatmeal one
really hit the spot.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.378
Fifteen seconds.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.813
She's saying this
girl told us about

07:59.913 --> 08:01.582
a strong-arm robbery and
we want to run with it.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.083
How young is this girl?
Elyse is ten.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.317
Oh, that's young
for a complaint.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.586
Well, we wanted to
talk to her dad too,

08:05.686 --> 08:06.887
but he's apparently
not a fan of the cops.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.488
Okay, so you got nothing?

08:08.589 --> 08:11.091
Except her statement.
Okay, maybe you two
have not heard,

08:11.191 --> 08:14.194
but street crime is skyrocketing
in our precinct. That is why

08:14.294 --> 08:16.463
I need every
pair of boots on the ground

08:16.564 --> 08:18.732
instead of trying to fill
the shoes of detectives.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.200
JANKO:
Okay, well, can we at least

08:20.300 --> 08:21.368
give our notes
to someone in the Squad?

08:21.468 --> 08:22.836
This girl needs help.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.639
I'm going up there now.
I will save you the trip.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.208
(McNichols sighs)

08:28.308 --> 08:29.943
DONNA: Henry, you didn't

08:30.043 --> 08:32.179
have to.
No, I did.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.683
What you were buying and why
is none of my business.

08:35.783 --> 08:39.286
20 years retired and the old
cop in me still won't shut up.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.954
(laughs)

08:41.054 --> 08:42.189
Thank you.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.225
Of course, a smart lady like you
would never fall for

08:45.325 --> 08:48.195
some of the scams that are
floating around these days.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.063
Like when your
computer freezes

08:50.163 --> 08:53.266
and there's a message that
you should make a phone call

08:53.366 --> 08:54.668
to get it unfrozen.

08:54.768 --> 08:58.138
Oh.
Or when an IRS
agent claims

08:58.238 --> 09:00.173
that you owe back taxes

09:00.273 --> 09:03.977
and the only way to pay up
is to use gift cards.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.313
It must be scary.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.849
Cough up the dough or the Feds

09:08.949 --> 09:10.550
take your home.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.953
And you can't
tell a soul

09:13.053 --> 09:15.288
because it might
violate privacy laws.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.624
Henry, stop, stop.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.425
Even though it's bogus.

09:19.526 --> 09:22.963
The IRS never uses the phone.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.433
Oh, God.
How could I have been so stupid?

09:26.533 --> 09:29.402
No, Donna. You're not stupid.

09:29.502 --> 09:30.838
I've already given him
the card numbers

09:30.938 --> 09:32.840
and the security codes
right when I got home.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.441
(sighs)

09:34.541 --> 09:37.177
Can we call him back?

09:37.277 --> 09:39.046
No one will answer.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.350
How much?

09:43.450 --> 09:45.485
Six...

09:45.585 --> 09:47.688
thousand dollars.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.790
Oh...

09:51.158 --> 09:52.559
Oh, my God.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.095
They're pros, Donna.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.730
So...

09:56.830 --> 09:59.900
th-that money is just... gone?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.470
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

10:04.672 --> 10:07.240
NUCIFERO:
But by the time I arrived,
Detective Hill

10:07.340 --> 10:09.476
had already interviewed
the cemetery caretaker

10:09.576 --> 10:11.745
and took possession
of all security tapes

10:11.845 --> 10:13.781
from the previous 48 hours.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.050
Anything else?

10:17.150 --> 10:20.553
NUCIFORO:
It appears Detective Hill
also called in a friend from CSU

10:20.654 --> 10:22.189
to dust the headstone
for prints

10:22.289 --> 10:25.125
and to collect any other
possible evidence in the area.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.360
(sighs)

10:27.460 --> 10:28.829
Thank you, Jimmy.

10:28.929 --> 10:29.997
Sir.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.631
(door opens)

10:31.732 --> 10:33.566
No surprise. He was upset.

10:33.667 --> 10:34.902
Who wouldn't be?

10:35.002 --> 10:37.570
I pity the guy,
Joe finds him first.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.807
Yeah, well, that's why
I said I'd handle it.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.541
Not to get all "by the book,"
but does this mean

10:41.641 --> 10:43.276
he disobeyed a direct order?

10:43.376 --> 10:45.278
I wasn't there as a PC.

10:45.378 --> 10:48.015
But even as his grandfather,
he agrees to stand down

10:48.115 --> 10:50.383
then doubles back the
moment you're out of sight?

10:50.483 --> 10:51.418
Rules are different
for grandparents.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.120
But not for grandkids.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.723
Come hell or high water,
you respect your elders.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.725
You got a problem,
let the parents lower the boom.

10:57.825 --> 11:00.393
Plausible deniability
for Pee-Paw.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.629
That was my granddad's name.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.768
Well, Abigail's right.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.738
Grandparents are supposed to
get the good end of the stick.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.640
All the fun,
none of the discipline.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.909
But this grandson

11:16.009 --> 11:19.880
is an adult
and in the family business.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.417
Well, look at that.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.087
Two Nine detectives
hard at work.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.357
Oh, hell no.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.392
BADILLO:
She stole our case?

11:32.492 --> 11:34.527
After making us feel like idiots
for bringing it up? Come on.

11:34.627 --> 11:35.528
Oh, Eddie.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.430
Eddie, no.
Why not?

11:37.530 --> 11:38.631
Maybe she has a good reason.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.968
For backstabbing us?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.936
I can say that in a nicer way.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.404
You're not gonna
say anything to a boss

11:44.504 --> 11:46.874
in front of that girl
and her dad.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.678
So, when?

11:51.779 --> 11:53.881
After we have a better idea
of what's going on.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.515
Let's go.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.088
The fuel trucks always
turn down this street

12:01.188 --> 12:03.623
so we're gonna block
the front and back with vans.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.858
Yeah, I know a place where
we can boost a couple...

12:04.958 --> 12:06.860
Patrick and Lance
handle vehicles.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.962
You're going with
Darren to get the guns.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.598
And on the day, I don't want any
creative thinking from you.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.534
We all stick to the plan.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.538
Geez, these humps really
have it out for me, huh?

12:18.638 --> 12:20.007
Whatever they want,
keep your trap shut.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.742
Johnny Druhan,
you're under arrest.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.512
Turn around, put your hands
behind your back. Now.

12:25.612 --> 12:26.814
The rest of you
take a big step back.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.748
Dash cam video
on the victim's camera

12:28.849 --> 12:31.418
shows that it was you
who assaulted him.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.955
Not for nothing, sir, but you
got lousy taste in employees.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.698
Sit down.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.904
Was this really necessary?

12:51.004 --> 12:52.539
I had to make it look real.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.041
So you made sure no one out
there's got ties to my boss?

12:54.141 --> 12:55.909
'Cause I saw a couple
eyeballing me.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.244
Paranoid much?

12:57.344 --> 12:59.046
Trust no one,
head on a swivel.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.380
You taught me that.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.115
You're amongst friends
here, John.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.783
So, where's your partner?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.152
Because you also taught me

13:05.252 --> 13:06.719
to never play both
good cop and bad cop.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.056
This ain't about being cops.
Oh, like hell it isn't.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.992
The boss of this crew,
Bob Youngblood, is a bad guy.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.061
I'm talking heists,
hits, drugs.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.464
And piece by piece, I'm making
my case to take down him

13:17.564 --> 13:19.532
and his buyers, the middlemen,
the gun-sellers, all of it.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.069
So, what about Naomi--
she doesn't matter?

13:22.169 --> 13:23.871
You know she does.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.172
Just not enough?

13:25.272 --> 13:27.040
Screw you.
I'm just saying.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.343
Is it really worth it
taking down a heating oil heist

13:30.443 --> 13:32.880
if you lose her and the kids?

13:32.980 --> 13:34.381
What happened to you, Danny?

13:34.481 --> 13:35.748
The same thing
that's gonna happen to you

13:35.849 --> 13:37.885
if you don't get your head
out of your ass.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.752
You mean the way you lost Linda.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.922
Look, that was
a damn shame.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.690
If you can't...
I mean anyone who gets hurt

13:43.790 --> 13:46.226
because you're putting the job
above everything else!

13:46.326 --> 13:47.627
Wake up, John!

13:47.727 --> 13:48.862
Come on, man.
If you were under back then

13:48.962 --> 13:50.730
and Linda came crying to me

13:50.830 --> 13:52.465
you would have taken
my damn head off!
Not if you convinced me to tell

13:52.565 --> 13:54.234
my handler
I need to come out.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.302
So, that's your
next stop, huh?

13:55.402 --> 13:56.669
No, it's your next stop.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.371
I will once I make the collars!

13:58.471 --> 14:00.207
What if they grease you first?

14:00.307 --> 14:01.741
Oh, come on, man!

14:01.841 --> 14:02.943
Trust me!

14:04.945 --> 14:06.846
I'm out of here.
No.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.615
We're not done till I say so.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.350
No, look, Danny,
I love you,

14:10.450 --> 14:12.052
and you did your job.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.787
Now I'm gonna get back
out there and do mine.

14:18.892 --> 14:19.927
Walk him out.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.395
(door opens)

14:22.495 --> 14:23.863
(door closes)

14:24.764 --> 14:28.235
Ripping off old people?
There's nothing sacred anymore.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.437
I know.
And it's only increasing.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.539
So, get me an audience
with whoever it is

14:32.639 --> 14:35.542
that heads up your
Elder Abuse Bureau.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.777
I'd be happy to.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.914
I get the feeling
there's a "but" coming.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.683
I just don't want you to get
your hopes up high.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.852
Cases like these
are really hard to prosecute.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.421
Why?
These scammers are jackals.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.990
The problem is
most of these scammers

14:50.090 --> 14:51.658
don't make an actual threat.

14:51.758 --> 14:54.227
They tug on their
victims' heartstrings

14:54.327 --> 14:56.796
and ask for help
or money or gift cards,

14:56.896 --> 15:00.267
usually around $50
to make it seem minor.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.468
Well, they've
threatened my friend

15:01.568 --> 15:04.137
and gotten away
with 6,000 bucks,

15:04.237 --> 15:06.173
which isn't
exactly minor.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.174
Your friend.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.708
Yeah.
Can you

15:08.808 --> 15:11.344
tell me anything more
about your friend?

15:12.312 --> 15:14.247
No, they've requested anonymity.

15:15.215 --> 15:18.885
They're gonna have to
come forward at some point.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.990
(laughs)
Erin. It's not me.

15:23.090 --> 15:26.359
Look, there is no shame in being
conned. These guys are good.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.694
Stop already.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.263
I promise to keep
this between ourselves.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.132
First you tell me
there's no point in trying

15:32.232 --> 15:34.267
and now I'm this
doddering old fool

15:34.367 --> 15:35.602
who won't admit it's him?

15:35.702 --> 15:37.404
No, that's not
what I'm trying to say.

15:37.504 --> 15:38.771
That's what I'm hearing.

15:38.871 --> 15:39.906
Oh...

15:40.673 --> 15:43.410
Look, Pop, let me just
walk you over there myself.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.811
What, and hold my hand

15:44.911 --> 15:47.880
so I don't
slip and break my hip?

15:47.981 --> 15:50.883
I'm good, Erin.
I'll see myself out.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.956
Hey, Cap. Uh, can I
bend your ear a moment?

15:57.057 --> 15:59.626
Yeah, sure, come in.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.261
Actually, let me guess.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.697
One of your people is working
some dog thefts and so

16:04.797 --> 16:05.865
you thought that you
would come in here

16:05.965 --> 16:07.467
and you would
pick my brain

16:07.567 --> 16:09.469
about the complaint
that I took this morning,

16:09.569 --> 16:11.971
a little girl on 145th Street?

16:13.106 --> 16:15.342
I didn't come in here
to trick you.
Right.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.510
FIO is smarter than that.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.512
Eddie was ready
to work that case.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.014
Here's my question.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.916
Did she call you right away
after she saw me talking

16:24.017 --> 16:26.386
with Elyse Mullins or did she
come running into your office

16:26.486 --> 16:28.721
just 'cause
she needed a big hug?

16:29.556 --> 16:32.092
Okay, so,
you're running with this?

16:36.563 --> 16:38.665
With both feet.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.871
All right, then.
We're done here.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.340
You know, Reagan...

16:47.440 --> 16:49.008
you know, a husband

16:49.109 --> 16:51.278
going on a fishing expedition
for his wife

16:51.378 --> 16:52.279
'cause she doesn't
have the guts

16:52.379 --> 16:54.114
isn't exactly a good look.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.849
And a captain poaching cases
from cops under her command

16:56.949 --> 17:00.353
runs a close second.
Thanks for your time.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.494
(sighs)

17:09.429 --> 17:10.897
Sir.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.800
Thank you, Baker.
(sighs)

17:20.673 --> 17:22.175
You asked to see me?

17:22.275 --> 17:23.376
(sighs)

17:23.476 --> 17:24.811
Have a seat.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.459
So...

17:41.761 --> 17:44.397
Why'd you lie to me?

17:46.433 --> 17:47.934
When I left the cemetery,

17:48.034 --> 17:49.869
I realized I had agreed
to something I shouldn't have.

17:49.969 --> 17:53.072
So, you went back
wearing the shield.
No.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.642
The caretaker agreed to help me
when I told him who I was.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.744
(sighs)
You should have told me.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.947
And get shot down, again?

18:01.047 --> 18:02.615
Look,

18:02.715 --> 18:04.617
I was just trying
to lower the temperature.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.586
For both of us.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.788
I don't see yours raised.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.459
Look harder.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.296
Sorry.
That was careless of me.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.665
Yeah, and wrong.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.968
You will hand over
the surveillance tapes

18:22.068 --> 18:25.305
and any evidence you have found
to Detective Nuciforo.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.039
I have a few leads.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.108
I'd like to continue this
on my own.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.110
That was not a suggestion.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.547
Ah. Now you are talking
as the PC.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.916
Look, Joe.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.386
I'm as upset as you are
about what they did.

18:39.486 --> 18:43.055
But most likely it was
drunk kids doing dumb stuff.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.526
At most, a charge
of criminal mischief.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.827
Felony criminal mischief,

18:47.927 --> 18:49.862
considering the price
of the headstone.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.102
(sighs) Boy...

18:58.505 --> 19:00.006
I stand corrected.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.975
If that's all this is.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.378
And what does that mean?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.947
It means what if his grave
was targeted?

19:08.047 --> 19:09.816
You see the street signs
named after cops

19:09.916 --> 19:11.150
that are being torn down.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.853
And what if it's worse
than that, hmm?

19:13.953 --> 19:16.956
What if the guy who put
my dad in that grave

19:17.056 --> 19:19.759
has a kid out there
who decided to do this?

19:20.893 --> 19:23.796
Joe, that kind of thinking

19:23.896 --> 19:26.533
is exactly why you shouldn't
be running this.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.000
What, thinking like a cop?

19:28.100 --> 19:31.271
A cop half-blinded
by a red mist.

19:37.043 --> 19:40.413
Would it be too much trouble
for an answer...

19:40.513 --> 19:42.882
say, at Sunday dinner?

19:45.818 --> 19:47.987
This your way of inviting me?

19:49.356 --> 19:53.092
Everyone on their birthday week
gets their favorite dessert.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.596
What was my dad's?

19:56.696 --> 19:58.030
(sighs)

19:58.130 --> 20:00.032
Come and find out.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.044
(door opens)

20:12.144 --> 20:13.813
(door closes)

20:15.282 --> 20:17.116
(sighs)

20:17.216 --> 20:18.351
Boy.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.619
She shut you down?

20:19.719 --> 20:20.787
No ifs, ands or buts.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.422
Well, maybe she's
hiding something.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.524
She did keep glancing
at a photo on her desk.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.058
What was it?

20:26.158 --> 20:28.027
I couldn't see it, and you
know what, it doesn't matter

20:28.127 --> 20:29.596
because she's the
boss and explaining

20:29.696 --> 20:31.030
or not explaining
is a perk of the job.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.433
So, ours is just
suck it up, move on?

20:33.533 --> 20:34.734
Yeah, pretty much.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.069
Sounds like good advice to me.
Thanks, Sarge.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.505
Later, guys.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.639
Good advice?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.007
Eddie, let's not
die on this hill.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.742
Did you not hear him
about the photo?

20:42.842 --> 20:44.110
Something's eating her.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.912
Now it's about her
and not Cruella De Vil

20:46.012 --> 20:47.647
or whoever's out there
stealing dogs.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.382
Can't it be about both?

20:49.482 --> 20:53.920
For me, it's neither.
So just drop it, okay?

21:00.627 --> 21:02.495
John went back to those guys?

21:02.595 --> 21:03.830
Unfortunately.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.965
So the kids and I
can go to hell.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.735
BAEZ:
No, he has tunnel vision.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.737
It happens to a lot
of undercovers.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.672
But he told Danny
this is his last job

21:12.772 --> 21:14.073
and then he's out.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.643
You know how many times
he's told me that?

21:16.743 --> 21:18.545
We know it's not easy.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.212
Anyway, Danny and I

21:20.313 --> 21:23.249
think it's time for us to
contact your husband's handler.

21:23.350 --> 21:26.085
We can't soft-pedal
the drug use, but we will

21:26.185 --> 21:28.421
remind him of your husband's
otherwise spotless record.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.022
What if he flips out?

21:30.122 --> 21:32.392
What if... what if his
handler is a hard-ass

21:32.492 --> 21:35.261
and he's still hooked on drugs
and he comes home

21:35.362 --> 21:37.397
pissed at the world? Or he
doesn't come home at all?

21:37.497 --> 21:39.031
God...

21:41.133 --> 21:42.569
I should have never
opened my mouth.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.003
No, you did
the right thing.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.038
You did.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.007
And we're gonna do
the right thing, too.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.443
See?

21:50.543 --> 21:51.744
By getting John back

21:51.844 --> 21:54.180
without notifying his handler.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.648
We're not?

21:55.748 --> 21:56.816
Danny, what are you saying?

21:56.916 --> 21:58.150
I'm saying that

21:58.250 --> 22:00.520
we're gonna get him
back to you the right way.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.356
Get him back to you
and to the kids,

22:03.456 --> 22:06.192
and back to being clean
and sober, like the old John,

22:06.292 --> 22:08.327
the way he always was.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.098
Okay?

22:26.813 --> 22:27.747
JOE:
It's, uh...

22:27.847 --> 22:29.248
it's good.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.550
Thanks. Whipped
it up myself.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.818
Wait, is this your first
lemon meringue?

22:31.918 --> 22:32.985
We were an ice cream family.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.821
Invite me over anytime.

22:34.921 --> 22:35.888
(chuckling)

22:35.988 --> 22:37.023
Guess I thought
for a dessert,

22:37.123 --> 22:38.124
it might just be
a little sweeter.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.792
Your dad hated sweets.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.060
How is that possible?

22:41.160 --> 22:42.762
That's what
I always said.
For Joe,

22:42.862 --> 22:45.898
tart, bitter, sour,
anything but sweet.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.067
Even when Danny tricked him
into eating a mud pie.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.068
Made with actual mud.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.070
You didn't.
Yeah, I did.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.905
And it was worth every bruise.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.407
(laughs)
JOE: Well, thank
goodness I didn't

22:54.507 --> 22:55.542
inherit his taste buds,

22:55.642 --> 22:56.943
just got his cop genes.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.277
Uh, speaking of,

22:58.377 --> 22:59.512
I may have a lead on the person

22:59.612 --> 23:01.748
who knocked over
and broke his headstone.

23:08.354 --> 23:10.222
You're still on it.

23:10.322 --> 23:11.758
What did you say?

23:11.858 --> 23:13.125
When'd this happen?

23:13.225 --> 23:15.361
Yeah, who the hell would
knock over a headstone?

23:18.364 --> 23:20.232
You didn't tell them?

23:21.768 --> 23:24.203
I just figured
why share the pain?

23:24.303 --> 23:26.606
Because he's
my grandson, Francis.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.482
Yeah, maybe 'cause
it's our brother?

23:37.183 --> 23:38.518
JOE:
I'm sorry,

23:38.618 --> 23:40.520
I don't get you guys.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.590
Like, half the time

23:43.690 --> 23:46.626
you-you swear each other
to secrecy...

23:46.726 --> 23:48.327
just long enough to
blab to everyone else.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.096
And the other half,

23:50.196 --> 23:51.698
you say everything
is on the table,

23:51.798 --> 23:54.501
except no one ever hears
a whisper about it.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.336
We're just as surprised
about this as you are.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.405
HENRY:
Yeah.

24:01.974 --> 24:05.177
Look, uh, this is on me.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.447
I'm sorry, everybody.

24:14.554 --> 24:18.224
All right, come on, guys.
What... what's done is done.

24:18.324 --> 24:19.659
We know now.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.494
Mm-hmm. Except if I would have
knew earlier,

24:21.594 --> 24:22.729
I would have dropped
everything I was doing

24:22.829 --> 24:25.331
to go help Joe find the guy.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.000
I would have driven.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.301
Excuse me.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.137
I'm sorry
to eat and run.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.304
After dropping that bomb?

24:32.404 --> 24:34.874
Just keep us updated.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.008
Yeah.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.110
'Cause everybody else ain't.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.712
(sighs)

24:40.947 --> 24:42.114
Sorry.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.450
* *

24:49.121 --> 24:50.590
(elevator dings)

24:52.224 --> 24:53.626
Uh oh, what's wrong?

24:53.726 --> 24:56.462
You can't read me that easy.
You can't read me that easy.

24:56.563 --> 24:57.664
Go down to Elder Abuse.

24:57.764 --> 24:59.498
See if there's
any open fraud cases

24:59.599 --> 25:01.367
involving IRS impersonators.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.736
Why, 'cause Henry
got snookered?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.404
I saw him with
you the other day

25:05.504 --> 25:07.774
and then stomping
back to the elevator.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.375
Oh, I don't know
if he's the victim,

25:09.475 --> 25:11.277
but I do know I pissed him off.

25:11.377 --> 25:12.545
Might be a wild goose chase.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.113
A lot of these scams
come out of places

25:14.213 --> 25:15.615
like Mumbai or Moscow.

25:15.715 --> 25:18.217
Dig unto you find a local one.

25:18.317 --> 25:19.986
Then pull Henry in?
Yeah.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.388
You know, there's gonna
come a day when my grandfather

25:22.488 --> 25:23.956
can't do what he's always done

25:24.056 --> 25:26.192
and it's gonna break
his heart and mine.

25:26.292 --> 25:29.028
Well, let's make sure
that day isn't today.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.601
Hey, thanks for
coming so fast.
It's good timing.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.102
We were just about to
make another run at you.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.804
Danny, Naomi's gone.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.171
She left you?

25:39.271 --> 25:40.973
I called her earlier and
said we needed to talk,

25:41.073 --> 25:42.975
after everything you
said the other day.
Okay.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.878
And when I got here,
all the doors were unlocked,

25:45.978 --> 25:47.413
but no Naomi.

25:47.513 --> 25:48.715
Well, did you try
calling her again?

25:48.815 --> 25:49.782
Yeah, it went straight
to voice mail.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.183
Maybe your wife got cold feet.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.252
She has been pretty upset.

25:53.352 --> 25:54.821
Or Youngblood grabbed her.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.656
What?
Come on, you don't know that.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.424
He-he saw you two roll up on me.

25:58.524 --> 26:00.593
Danny, if he got wise
somehow, man...

26:00.693 --> 26:01.894
Okay, did you check
the entire house?

26:01.994 --> 26:03.462
Of course.
All right, where are the kids?

26:03.562 --> 26:04.731
She sent them
to be with her parents

26:04.831 --> 26:05.598
so we could
hash things out alone.

26:05.698 --> 26:06.866
Well, that's good.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.534
Do you have security cameras?
No.

26:08.635 --> 26:09.869
Well, then we'll ping
her phone and see

26:09.969 --> 26:10.903
if any of your
neighbors have cameras.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.138
(phone rings)

26:13.039 --> 26:15.642
It's from Youngblood.
What's it say?

26:15.742 --> 26:17.109
"Where are you?
We got work to do."

26:17.209 --> 26:18.945
Sounds like business as usual.

26:19.045 --> 26:22.214
Or he's lying. Either way,
I got to get back to him.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.216
Hold on. You just said
you thought he made you.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.785
Which one is it?

26:25.885 --> 26:27.419
Well, if he did, they'll be
looking for a reaction.

26:27.519 --> 26:29.689
If not, we'll just
keep planning.

26:29.789 --> 26:33.860
Now, please, could you
do what you said?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.662
Find Naomi.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.000
Anthony.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.869
Henry, come on in.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.371
I was surprised
to get your message.

26:45.471 --> 26:46.673
Well, from what I understand,

26:46.773 --> 26:48.340
you have a friend
who recently got scammed,

26:48.440 --> 26:51.243
so I figured you might want
to pitch in on a similar case.

26:51.343 --> 26:52.979
Have you run this by Erin?

26:53.079 --> 26:54.213
Did I need to?

26:54.313 --> 26:55.748
Apparently she has doubts.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.350
About getting help
from a former PC?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.552
Seems like a no-brainer to me.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.322
Okay. What do you got?

27:03.422 --> 27:04.623
Well, the tough part

27:04.724 --> 27:06.759
is always finding
the scammers' phone banks

27:06.859 --> 27:08.494
because they use
untraceable numbers

27:08.594 --> 27:09.696
and they stay on the move.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.898
Mm-hmm.
But our Elder Abuse Bureau

27:11.998 --> 27:14.801
just collared
one of their money mules.

27:14.901 --> 27:17.603
The guys who take the stolen
gift card info,

27:17.704 --> 27:20.472
go into the stores
and make the actual purchases.

27:20.572 --> 27:22.408
So, we sweat him, we flip him

27:22.508 --> 27:24.610
and he coughs up
the phone bank address.

27:24.711 --> 27:27.179
See?
Like you've done this before.

27:27.279 --> 27:30.717
Erin says this case
has to be airtight.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.284
Which is why
we're also gonna set up

27:32.384 --> 27:33.953
a fake senior citizen charity.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.222
Phony website,
phony credentials,

27:36.322 --> 27:40.693
so the mule can introduce you
to his boss as an insider

27:40.793 --> 27:42.729
willing to sell
members' personal data.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.563
The nail in the coffin.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.099
And who better to hammer it?

27:47.199 --> 27:48.701
(chuckles)

27:57.009 --> 27:58.811
MCNICHOLS: Unbelievable.
Hey, Sarge.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.247
I was just, um...
Oh, no, no, no.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.549
Do not snoop and insult me.

28:03.649 --> 28:05.051
Sorry, boss.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.552
I'm...

28:06.652 --> 28:08.955
I'm sorry about sending Jamie
in here the other day.

28:09.055 --> 28:12.491
I'm just...
I'm sorry, about all of it.

28:12.591 --> 28:14.093
Okay, you...

28:14.193 --> 28:16.162
you being apologetic is even
worse than you being nosy.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.831
Did you at least find what
you were looking for?

28:18.931 --> 28:21.100
The reason I stole your
dog-napping case?

28:22.969 --> 28:24.536
Does it have something
to do with her?

28:24.636 --> 28:27.940
It has everything
to do with her.

28:31.043 --> 28:31.978
Is she okay?

28:32.078 --> 28:33.512
(scoffs)

28:33.612 --> 28:35.214
Not after how I screwed up.

28:37.984 --> 28:41.487
The other day, after you
and Badillo came to me,

28:41.587 --> 28:42.789
I was reading your notes

28:42.889 --> 28:44.223
on my way up to the
squad and I realized

28:44.323 --> 28:45.557
that Elyse told you

28:45.657 --> 28:49.028
exactly what Kelly told me
a few weeks ago.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.765
She came home crying.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.501
She told me someone
grabbed her dog on the street

28:55.601 --> 28:57.603
and then sped off in a red car.

28:58.370 --> 28:59.305
You're kidding.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.739
What did I do?
I just...

29:00.840 --> 29:04.043
accused her of being
irresponsible and losing it

29:04.143 --> 29:05.845
the same way
that she lost her cell phone

29:05.945 --> 29:07.379
or the way she doesn't
do her chores.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.081
(sighs)

29:09.181 --> 29:11.918
That little girl came to me
and she was brokenhearted

29:12.018 --> 29:15.287
and I treated her like a perp.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.792
Running this house
has got to be stressful.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.493
Eh, it's no excuse.
Next time you have

29:21.593 --> 29:24.730
a stressful day, you say, "Hey,
Janko, let's go get a beer."

29:24.831 --> 29:27.099
(chuckles)

29:27.199 --> 29:28.300
Really?

29:28.400 --> 29:30.402
Ladies in this business

29:30.502 --> 29:33.272
are few and far between.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.841
Might as well

29:34.941 --> 29:38.344
get drunk and bitch about it
together, right?

29:39.645 --> 29:41.780
Yeah. Thank you, Janko.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.352
Uh, let me find Badillo

29:46.452 --> 29:50.857
and we'll figure a way
to find that red car.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.898
No, stop! Let go of me!

29:58.998 --> 30:00.967
Yep. Youngblood got her.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.534
Look at him.
Right out in the open.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.970
Not a care in the world.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.704
She must be scared
out of her mind.
Yeah.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.173
And if we'd alerted the handler

30:07.273 --> 30:08.574
from the jump
like we should have...

30:08.674 --> 30:10.376
You mean if I had.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.044
(sighs)

30:12.144 --> 30:14.680
I'm just trying to understand
where your head's at.

30:14.780 --> 30:17.516
We have tons of cases and...

30:17.616 --> 30:19.251
fine, you want
to help your friend.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.853
But after he blew us off,

30:20.953 --> 30:24.256
we agreed we would
call the handler, and then,

30:24.356 --> 30:26.859
suddenly you tell Naomi,
"Yes, we're on the case."

30:26.959 --> 30:28.995
I looked at his kids
and it occurred to me

30:29.095 --> 30:31.998
his handler can't be
the one to do this.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.934
I'm the one that taught him
to go all in on a case.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.735
The only way to
guarantee him

30:36.835 --> 30:38.104
getting home
safely to his family

30:38.204 --> 30:40.406
is for me to be the one
to get him out.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.474
Okay.

30:42.574 --> 30:43.675
(phone vibrating)

30:43.775 --> 30:45.677
So, here we are.

30:45.777 --> 30:46.979
For the last time.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.780
I promise you that.

30:48.881 --> 30:49.882
It's John.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.283
Hey. What's going on?

30:51.383 --> 30:52.618
Danny, they have her.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.486
I don't know where,
but I overheard

30:54.586 --> 30:55.554
Youngblood talking with one of

30:55.654 --> 30:56.588
the other guys about how

30:56.688 --> 30:57.689
he needs insurance on me.

30:57.789 --> 30:59.391
They made you?
No, Danny,

30:59.491 --> 31:01.360
because get collared for road
rage makes me seem squirrelly.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.662
He thinks I'm gonna
screw up the heist tomorrow.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.831
Danny...

31:05.932 --> 31:07.333
it's everything I can do

31:07.433 --> 31:09.335
not to shove a gun
in this guy's face right now.

31:09.435 --> 31:10.636
No. You do that,

31:10.736 --> 31:11.637
whoever's holding a gun
to her head

31:11.737 --> 31:13.339
is gonna pull the trigger.

31:13.439 --> 31:14.974
Just get back to them.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.976
Okay?
And I'll text you with the plan.

31:22.014 --> 31:23.115
So, you have one?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.850
No.

31:24.951 --> 31:27.019
But I'm working on it.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.497
Thank you.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.775
Thanks for seeing me, Paula.

31:49.875 --> 31:52.945
Yeah, well, I was
about to reach out to you,

31:53.045 --> 31:54.546
but you beat me to it.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.016
So, he told you.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.850
On the night
of his dad's birthday,

31:58.951 --> 32:01.153
Joe shows up
out of the blue, upset.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.322
And I couldn't get
a clue out of him, but after

32:03.422 --> 32:04.890
pushing his dinner
around his plate

32:04.991 --> 32:06.092
for the 40th time...

32:06.192 --> 32:07.426
You broke him.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.196
My son is not a perp.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.897
(sighs)

32:11.998 --> 32:15.534
Not a good choice
of words, Frank. Sorry.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.438
Well, better than Mom, right?

32:19.538 --> 32:22.008
Well, and certainly
not a grandfather.

32:22.108 --> 32:24.110
So, did you come here
looking for pointers

32:24.210 --> 32:25.344
on how to break him?

32:25.444 --> 32:27.246
No.

32:27.346 --> 32:29.815
Just to understand him.

32:29.915 --> 32:31.517
Look, uh...

32:31.617 --> 32:33.185
I'm just not...

32:33.285 --> 32:36.555
really sure of my sight here,
this is new terrain for me.

32:36.655 --> 32:39.391
You have other grandkids, Frank.

32:39.491 --> 32:40.926
Yeah, and I watched them grow up

32:41.027 --> 32:43.195
in Little League
and at school plays

32:43.295 --> 32:47.333
and at the dinner table,
but I don't have that with Joe.

32:48.234 --> 32:50.669
And right now...

32:50.769 --> 32:52.704
we might as well be strangers.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.374
So maybe don't
bark orders at him

32:55.474 --> 32:57.743
and expect a snap salute.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.647
Is that what he said?

33:02.448 --> 33:03.982
In so many words.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.818
And maybe some of your own?

33:08.654 --> 33:10.056
The way my Joe grew up,

33:10.156 --> 33:13.492
it was pretty much
me and him against the world.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.662
And... although that is a bond
that I treasure,

33:16.762 --> 33:19.565
maybe it hasn't
done him any favors.

33:19.665 --> 33:23.769
Tough to lower those walls
with anyone new.

33:23.869 --> 33:26.838
Especially with all of you
all coming at him at once.

33:26.938 --> 33:30.842
Like a tribe, with your lore,
your rituals, your traditions.

33:30.942 --> 33:33.279
Oh, come on.
We're just a family.

33:33.379 --> 33:37.149
Yeah, we're close-knit, but
we're not from another planet.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.051
Yet here you are.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.752
Looking for advice.

33:44.156 --> 33:45.324
Look...

33:45.424 --> 33:47.593
I tried to tell him
about his father,

33:47.693 --> 33:50.929
but I only spent a small
amount of time with his dad.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.099
And I only knew so much.

33:55.067 --> 33:56.368
(sighs)

33:56.468 --> 33:59.605
And the one person who could
show him the ropes

33:59.705 --> 34:02.441
is someone he never met
and never will.

34:06.312 --> 34:08.814
My son likes you Reagans.

34:08.914 --> 34:11.283
Really, he does.
He admires you.

34:11.383 --> 34:14.486
But the one person
in your family that he loves

34:14.586 --> 34:16.655
is his dad.

34:20.326 --> 34:22.528
Who he never knew.

34:24.930 --> 34:26.765
(sighs)

34:28.033 --> 34:31.637
And to see his dad's grave
like that...

34:32.604 --> 34:33.872
...and then be forbidden

34:33.972 --> 34:36.142
from finding out who did it...

34:39.945 --> 34:41.380
Honestly, Frank,

34:41.480 --> 34:43.749
what did you expect him to do?

34:45.984 --> 34:48.220
(sighs)

34:52.524 --> 34:53.792
Boss, uh, this is the guy

34:53.892 --> 34:56.295
from Park Slope
Senior Coalition.

34:56.395 --> 34:57.296
Bill Tumas.

34:57.396 --> 34:58.797
Nice to meet you.

34:58.897 --> 35:00.632
BOSS: What's your job there?
HENRY: Member services.

35:00.732 --> 35:02.668
So, I have access to addresses,

35:02.768 --> 35:05.237
social security data,

35:05.337 --> 35:06.505
unlisted phone numbers.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.607
How many members?
Just shy of 2,000.

35:08.707 --> 35:12.144
But I also have a log-in
to the national database.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.712
For the right price.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.815
20 a head, one percent on the
back end six months from now.

35:16.915 --> 35:20.419
50 a head and five percent,
two months from now.

35:20.519 --> 35:23.455
Thirty, three percent,
three months.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.291
Deal.

35:25.391 --> 35:26.792
(chuckles)

35:26.892 --> 35:28.494
Mr. Tumas, this
is gonna convince

35:28.594 --> 35:30.662
a lot of coots
that we are legit.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.398
From their bank accounts
to our pockets

35:32.498 --> 35:34.233
in no time flat.
(chuckles)

35:34.333 --> 35:37.236
And here's the thumb drive
with all the info on it.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.770
The hell is that?

35:38.870 --> 35:39.971
ABETEMARCO: Police! Don't move!
MULE: What's going on?

35:40.071 --> 35:41.673
Keep our hands where
we can see them.

35:41.773 --> 35:44.410
Right there, back up. Hands up!
Put the phone down.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.744
Get up against the wall.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.980
Hell has a special place
for scum like you.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.617
Bag this trash.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.319
ABETEMARCO:
Henry...

35:53.419 --> 35:55.587
you were supposed to
seal the deal and exit.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.123
And miss the look on his face?

35:58.224 --> 36:00.091
(laughing)

36:00.192 --> 36:02.694
Good job.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.900
* *

36:28.520 --> 36:29.921
Okay.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.056
(grunting)

36:32.258 --> 36:33.091
Police!

36:33.191 --> 36:34.360
Don't move!
Hands up!

36:34.460 --> 36:35.594
Put your hands
in the air!

36:35.694 --> 36:37.028
Put your hands up!

36:37.128 --> 36:38.630
You just hijacked
a tanker full of water.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.065
Now where's my wife?!

36:40.966 --> 36:42.301
Put your hands in the air!
You okay?

36:43.902 --> 36:44.936
Tell me or you're dead!

36:45.036 --> 36:46.672
Screw you both.
BAEZ: Danny.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.707
John.
John.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.178
(indistinct chatter)

37:04.656 --> 37:07.693
I'm so sorry.
Okay.

37:12.998 --> 37:15.033
Same red car from
the pet store.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.235
And it matches
Elyse's description.

37:17.336 --> 37:18.637
Police! Don't move!

37:18.737 --> 37:20.439
Hands where we
can see them, now!

37:20.539 --> 37:21.807
Hey, now!

37:21.907 --> 37:23.275
All right, all right,
drop it. Come on.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.376
How did you find us?

37:24.476 --> 37:25.677
Oh, maybe next time

37:25.777 --> 37:27.112
don't pick up 300
pounds of kibble

37:27.212 --> 37:29.381
in the same red car you
steal dogs with, genius.

37:29.481 --> 37:30.382
Let's go.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.783
Cuff that loser!

37:31.883 --> 37:34.252
Get her out of here!
Except I'm not seeing any.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.956
(dogs whimpering)

37:38.924 --> 37:40.258
Oh, they're here.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.964
(barking)
McNICHOLS: Oh...

37:46.064 --> 37:47.999
(chuckling)

37:48.099 --> 37:49.701
Hi.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.141
Hello, Mr. Pickles.

37:56.241 --> 37:58.209
Tag's still on his collar.
Come on.

37:58.310 --> 38:00.646
Do you see Kelly's dog, boss?
MCNICHOLS: No.

38:00.746 --> 38:04.082
Any of these go unclaimed,
she gets her pick of the litter.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.352
Thank you.

38:08.554 --> 38:09.688
DONNA:
And

38:09.788 --> 38:11.289
you arrested him?

38:11.390 --> 38:14.292
With help from some of my
friends in the DA's Office.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.328
Unfortunately...

38:16.428 --> 38:17.963
(sighs)

38:18.063 --> 38:20.932
...none of your details
were in the evidence collected.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.334
Oh.

38:22.434 --> 38:25.003
So, not my scammer, huh?

38:25.103 --> 38:27.138
Sorry.

38:27.238 --> 38:30.308
Well, an expensive lesson.
Hey,

38:30.409 --> 38:33.512
we stopped some guys
ripping off people like us.

38:33.612 --> 38:34.680
(chuckles)

38:34.780 --> 38:37.683
Not us. Me, Henry.

38:37.783 --> 38:40.452
There but for the grace of God.

38:41.853 --> 38:42.788
Really?

38:42.888 --> 38:44.089
Oh, you think I haven't panicked

38:44.189 --> 38:46.858
when something popped up
on my computer?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.060
The world's changing so fast

38:49.160 --> 38:51.262
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.767
What's the expression--
growing old isn't for wimps?

38:55.867 --> 38:57.903
Still better than
the alternative.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.971
(laughs) Yes.

39:00.071 --> 39:01.172
(laughs)

39:02.841 --> 39:04.009
JOHN:
Danny, I'm, uh,

39:04.109 --> 39:06.144
I'm real sorry about all this.

39:06.244 --> 39:08.346
No need to be.
No, there is.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.315
Without you, there's...

39:10.416 --> 39:12.283
no telling how
this would have ended.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.219
You would have made the collar.
That's how it would have ended.

39:14.319 --> 39:16.388
Yeah, and lost everything else
along the way.

39:16.488 --> 39:19.525
So... thank you.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.126
You don't have to thank me.

39:21.226 --> 39:23.194
Thank your wife.
She's the real hero.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.733
So, uh...

39:27.833 --> 39:30.001
any advice about
what comes next?

39:30.101 --> 39:32.804
'Cause I sure as hell am
done with undercover work.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.473
That's good.

39:34.573 --> 39:37.075
A guy like you, after rehab,
with your skills,

39:37.175 --> 39:40.078
I'm sure you can write
your own ticket, John.

39:40.178 --> 39:42.080
Maybe, uh...

39:42.180 --> 39:43.782
maybe we get the
band back together?
No.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.484
Huh? (chuckles)
No way.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.319
I'm very happy with my partner.
All right.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.522
In fact, I'd say, uh,

39:50.622 --> 39:53.324
we both have
the right women in our lives.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.994
Thanks again, man.

39:56.094 --> 39:59.465
Go ahead.
They miss you.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.833
Hey.
Hey.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.902
You hungry?

40:05.904 --> 40:08.139
* *

40:15.781 --> 40:17.849
(sighs)

40:23.655 --> 40:25.591
Glad you came.

40:25.691 --> 40:27.258
So you can rub my nose in it?

40:28.627 --> 40:31.497
Oh, I've stayed away
from the investigation.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.499
Really? You?

40:33.599 --> 40:36.468
I heard there was
a damn good detective

40:36.568 --> 40:38.804
heading it up.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.341
Didn't take much chops.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.381
The caretaker's nephew
took a hammer to this marker

40:50.482 --> 40:52.884
and a few others
after his uncle fired him

40:52.984 --> 40:55.320
for always being late.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.892
Families aren't always easy.

41:02.093 --> 41:05.463
But thank you for not
taking a hammer to anything.

41:09.334 --> 41:11.202
You know...

41:11.302 --> 41:13.171
there's a learning curve here

41:13.271 --> 41:16.241
and I'm afraid I didn't
navigate it very well.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.411
Makes two of us.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.517
I'd say it won't
happen again, but...

41:25.617 --> 41:27.485
God knows it probably will.

41:32.891 --> 41:33.992
(sighs)

41:34.092 --> 41:35.927
You want to do the honors?

41:52.310 --> 41:54.412
"Joseph Conor Reagan,

41:54.512 --> 41:57.282
"beloved son, brother...

41:59.585 --> 42:01.286
...and father."

42:09.094 --> 42:10.962
You added something.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.565
I did.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.902
What do you think?

42:24.676 --> 42:26.211
It's perfect.

42:30.081 --> 42:33.118
