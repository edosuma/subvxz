"I am so sorry.

21:39.567 --> 21:42.066

Kristen's back is funny,

21:42.100 --> 21:43.767
because I just think of
all the times

21:44.000 --> 21:45.600
Kristen lied to me.

- Why is he making this up

we'll be done.

25:43.467 --> 25:45.000
We're gonna show
everybody the bar.

25:45.033 --> 25:46.333
- And I'm picking up
more CO2 for the--

25:46.367 --> 25:48.133
- Okay.
- for the Ufrost.

25:48.166 --> 25:49.433
- Okay.

25:49.467 --> 25:51.667
- When the Toms get to talking
about their bar

25:51.700 --> 25:53.233
and all the things that
are going into it,

25:53.266 --> 25:55.633
it's like they go into
their own little world,

25:55.667 --> 25:58.266
and I honestly don't even think
they know that I'm here.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.100
- My infusion machine
won't make it in time.

26:00.133 --> 26:01.433
So we'll just
go with my--

26:01.467 --> 26:03.200

your infusion machine.

26:03.233 --> 26:05.200
- You are my infusion machine.

26:05.233 --> 26:06.700
- How was riding
with Lisa?

26:06.734 --> 26:08.400
- It was good.
It was fun.

26:08.433 --> 26:11.700
She said that you need to

but when it comes
to Ariana,

26:19.367 --> 26:22.333
it's not like she's been
super productive either.

26:22.367 --> 26:25.166
She can get things done
without me being there.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.367

had it completed...

26:27.400 --> 26:29.200
- Ooh.

26:29.233 --> 26:31.467
- if you had not wanted to be
a part of it so bad,

26:31.500 --> 26:34.166
and maybe we would be at a
party for my book right now

26:34.200 --> 26:35.266

organizing stuff,

Like, you think putting
this much Cholula

31:55.300 --> 31:58.233

Ow! Sh--!

be able to imagine

34:19.433 --> 34:21.133
a future where me and Katie
have, like, maybe

34:21.166 --> 34:23.100
a house in the hills--
being a little optimistic,

34:23.133 --> 34:25.667
but hopefully
a house in the hills,

34:25.700 --> 34:28.667
working at the restaurant,
killing it.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.133
We got kids,
hopefully two boys.

34:30.166 --> 34:33.300
We got, like,
six or seven dogs,

34:33.333 --> 34:34.533
maybe, like,
a llama

34:34.567 --> 34:37.066
and I feel
fulfilled.

34:38.734 --> 34:40.600
- Are there bones
in here?

34:40.633 --> 34:43.133
- There's no way
there's a bone.

34:43.166 --> 34:44.467
- Yeah,
a little one.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.000
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

34:46.033 --> 34:48.400
One time I ate
king salmon

34:48.433 --> 34:50.100

skinny bone

34:50.133 --> 34:52.500
lodged in the back of my throat

34:52.533 --> 34:54.633
- One time, when I was eating
a Fruit by the Foot as a kid,

34:54.667 --> 34:56.700
I got so excited to eat it,
I didn't take the plastic off

34:56.734 --> 34:58.567
and I just started
eating it,

34:58.600 --> 34:59.567

my esophagus

34:59.600 --> 35:01.066

35:14.600 --> 35:17.166

some struggles .

35:17.200 --> 35:19.000
- I know.

35:19.033 --> 35:21.533
- And something I haven't
talked to anyone about really

35:21.567 --> 35:25.767
is dealing with,
like--like, depression...

35:26.000 --> 35:28.467

- or familiar with

35:35.700 --> 35:37.066
or anything.

35:37.100 --> 35:40.433

35:40.467 --> 35:45.433
waking up in the ICU

35:45.467 --> 35:47.467
with a neck brace on,

35:47.500 --> 35:50.533
IVs in both arms,

35:50.567 --> 35:53.033
doctors all around me,
poking me,

35:53.066 --> 35:54.734
asking me questions,
what my name is,

35:54.767 --> 35:57.667
what the day is,
like, where am I, who am I,

35:57.700 --> 35:59.600
and it turns out,

35:59.633 --> 36:02.500
I had...

36:02.533 --> 36:04.000
fallen through
a skylight.

36:04.033 --> 36:07.100
Before, I mean,
I was always positive,

36:07.133 --> 36:08.667

- Yeah.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.200
- and after my accident,
something--

36:10.233 --> 36:11.667

- Yeah.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.100

- It turned your world

36:13.133 --> 36:14.600
upside down, right?
- It did.

36:14.633 --> 36:17.066
I would get mad
and angry

36:17.100 --> 36:18.600

- Yeah.

36:18.633 --> 36:20.500
- and fights.
- I knew it was bad,

36:20.533 --> 36:22.433
and I think a lot of your
friends think it was bad,

36:22.467 --> 36:24.100
but I don't think
they realize just how--

36:24.133 --> 36:26.467
how close to death
you came.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.533
- I hated myself
at times.

36:27.567 --> 36:29.233
- Yeah.
