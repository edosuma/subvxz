WEBVTT

00:09.042 --> 00:11.110
Bowling.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.612
One of the world's
oldest sports.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.047
Artifacts date bowling
back to ancient Egypt

00:16.050 --> 00:20.285
and the Roman empire
over 5,000 years ago.

00:20.287 --> 00:21.620
Or as my mom would say,

00:21.622 --> 00:24.156
"about the same age
as the earth."

00:26.660 --> 00:30.029
Modern rules
were established in 1895

00:30.031 --> 00:31.697
in New York City,

00:31.699 --> 00:34.400
and have since evolved
into what is widely regarded

00:34.402 --> 00:37.569
as the highest form
of competition among man.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.739
You got one competitor,
ten pins,

00:40.741 --> 00:43.776
and a polyurethane ball.

00:43.778 --> 00:45.744
Some play for fun,

00:45.746 --> 00:48.147
others compete for glory.

00:48.149 --> 00:52.251
I bowl
because it's who I am.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.086
I'm Emily baardsson
and you're watching...

00:58.358 --> 01:01.260
Ah, jeepers.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.417
Here in roseau county,

01:58.419 --> 02:02.287
we do a big bowling event
every year at my alley.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.289
Actually,
it's not my alley.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.226
Uh, it was my uncle Harley's,

02:07.228 --> 02:10.562
uh, but he's dead now.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.832
I run it,
well, I guess it is my alley.

02:13.834 --> 02:17.202
Anyway, we call it the, uh,
wait for it,

02:17.204 --> 02:18.604
the roseau bowl.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.572
You know,
'cause the football game.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.908
Anyway, it really is a big event
around here every year.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.710
This year
we're gonna reopen

02:24.712 --> 02:26.445
the open-age,
open-gender brackets
to figure out

02:26.447 --> 02:28.213
who is the absolutely
best bowler.

02:28.215 --> 02:29.648
It's a question
that's on everybody's mind,

02:29.650 --> 02:31.316
and we just
have a right to know.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.385
So that's what
we're gonna do, and plus,

02:33.387 --> 02:35.854
it should get me
a whole bunch of extra moolah
from concession sales

02:35.856 --> 02:38.690
'cause last time
we did the open-age,
open-gender bracket,

02:38.692 --> 02:42.394
concession sales
went through the roof.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.898
I mean, you're not making a
bunch of money on shoe rentals.

02:45.900 --> 02:50.302
You're not.
If we can avoid a post-tourney
controversy this time,

02:50.304 --> 02:54.473
we may make
the open-age, open-gender
bracket a regular thing.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.279
Friggin' fountain drink.

03:01.915 --> 03:05.184
That was the first episode
of my video blog,

03:05.186 --> 03:10.222
which was, jeez, wow,
it was six years ago now.

03:10.224 --> 03:13.392
So, yeah,
got a bunch of comments
about the title.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.261
Holy buckets.
I had no idea people were gonna
take it like that.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.965
So I quickly changed it
to "Emily's turkeys"

03:19.967 --> 03:22.334
for the next episode.
You know, because of the whole

03:22.336 --> 03:23.835
three strikes in a row thing?

03:23.837 --> 03:25.637
You're looking at
"Emily's turkeys."

03:25.639 --> 03:28.340
After getting a bunch of
inappropriate nipple comments,

03:28.342 --> 03:30.943
I switched it to "Emily xxx,"
'cause I figured

03:30.945 --> 03:32.611
it's the same thing as
bowling a Turkey,

03:32.613 --> 03:33.712
except not dirty.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.849
What the frick
was I thinking?

03:37.851 --> 03:40.252
To be fair,
that video got a lot
of views,

03:40.254 --> 03:42.888
but I don't think
it's what the people were
expecting, you know?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.957
So after that,
i made the final decision

03:44.959 --> 03:47.259
to call it
"rollin' with Emily,"

03:47.261 --> 03:50.229
and, uh, that's what
my video blog's been
called ever since.

03:58.871 --> 03:59.938
Oh, yeah.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.842
I suppose living legend

04:03.844 --> 04:06.979
would be an appropriate way
to refer to Gunnar solberg.

04:08.881 --> 04:10.749
No, no, after you.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.951
Jeez Louise, go already.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.954
I mean,
how many people can say
they've dominated

04:15.956 --> 04:18.390
ten out of the last
12 roseau bowls?

04:18.392 --> 04:19.891
Gunnar can say that.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.459
He says it all the time.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.028
Ten for 12, baby.
Ten of 12.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.564
Ten of the last 12.
Last seven straight.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.532
Ten for 12? Literally.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.701
I'll learn you
something else,

04:29.703 --> 04:31.403
about five years ago,

04:31.405 --> 04:33.405
they did an open bracket.

04:33.407 --> 04:36.942
Not only did I dominate
my cousin Emily

04:36.944 --> 04:39.845
so hard that
she quit competing,

04:39.847 --> 04:43.715
they closed
the open bracket forever,

04:43.717 --> 04:47.419
till like the end of time.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.055
I mean, until now.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.923
I guess that's what you get
for going to college

04:51.925 --> 04:54.393
thinking you're better than
everybody else.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.962
You ain't better than
Gunnar solberg...

04:56.964 --> 04:59.498
Fart face!

04:59.500 --> 05:02.401
She'll know what
I'm talking about.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.903
I can do a close up
on "fart face"
if you guys need it.

05:04.905 --> 05:09.374
- Nah.
- Like... all right.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.754
Hi, I'm Barry Williams.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.757
I work here at
the warroad bowling alley.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.659
Um, mostly I do
my working in--

05:27.661 --> 05:29.661
uh, frickin' face is itchy--

05:29.663 --> 05:32.698
uh, mostly work in,
uh, concessions,

05:32.700 --> 05:35.400
but when my cash drawer
comes out on point

05:35.402 --> 05:37.903
for three days in a row,

05:37.905 --> 05:39.838
Alan lets me
hit up shoe duty.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.607
So it's pretty, um,

05:42.609 --> 05:44.609
you know,
it's whatever,
you know?

05:44.611 --> 05:46.078
It's pretty cool.

05:52.985 --> 05:55.053
I retired from
competitive bowling

05:55.055 --> 05:58.690
about five years ago,
after the last open tournament.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.426
It, uh,
it wasn't because of
Gunnar beating me.

06:01.428 --> 06:04.496
Or, uh, you know,
him rubbing it in my face
real bad afterwards,

06:04.498 --> 06:06.465
or, you know,

06:06.467 --> 06:09.701
because of what happened
to my dad.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.603
I mean, yeah, sure,
he was a real jerk

06:11.605 --> 06:13.605
and, uh, he made me feel
real lousy about it,

06:13.607 --> 06:15.140
but that's not why I quit.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.775
You know, I just got--

06:16.777 --> 06:19.111
I got too much on
my plate now, you know?

06:19.113 --> 06:21.446
Mmm.

06:21.448 --> 06:25.784
I mean, I just
got too much to do,
you know?

06:25.786 --> 06:28.754
Oh, I'm super excited for
the tournament this year,

06:28.756 --> 06:30.822
but I try to compete
to be a bowling guy,

06:30.824 --> 06:32.557
I'm not a bowler.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.894
My dream, actually,
is to try to be a singer.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.896
You know, like,
uh, Justin bieber.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.865
Um, but if you guys wanted,

06:39.867 --> 06:41.733
I could probably do
a quick fast singing

06:41.735 --> 06:43.602
for you
to hear me do that.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.840
I've been running
my video blog which,

06:48.842 --> 06:51.843
you know,
gets literally dozens
of hits every week.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.545
And, um,

06:53.547 --> 06:54.880
I've been training
my favorite aunt--

06:54.882 --> 06:57.048
ooh. Friggin' bump.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.418
I've been, uh, training
my favorite aunt Donna

06:59.420 --> 07:01.420
to be a bowler,
which is, uh,

07:01.422 --> 07:03.588
which is where
we're heading right now,

07:03.590 --> 07:06.057
and I'm teaching fifth grade
right here in warroad.

07:08.728 --> 07:10.195
You know,
I'd like to see
Gunnar get in

07:10.197 --> 07:11.763
the physical peak condition
necessary to compete

07:11.765 --> 07:13.031
with that kind
of workload.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.633
No siree Bob.
He couldn't do it.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.204
So that's why
i friggin' retired.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.709
Yeah, I know Emily
has a fancy job,

07:24.711 --> 07:26.711
but she's such a idiot.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.214
I get this
whole basement
to myself.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.049
Rent free. Boom!

07:31.051 --> 07:32.918
And then I'll blow it up.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.086
I do still get to the lanes
quite a bit.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.855
Uh, actually, I, uh,

07:36.857 --> 07:39.724
took my fifth graders
bowling last week,

07:39.726 --> 07:43.728
and, uh, oh,
i gotta tell ya,
jeez Louise,

07:43.730 --> 07:46.031
one of my students,
who I shall not name,

07:46.033 --> 07:47.732
Jared h.,

07:47.734 --> 07:50.569
somehow managed to bowl
in the single digits.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.477
He had bumpers
and everything.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.480
I mean, I didn't even know
that was possible.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.114
He scored a seven!

08:07.620 --> 08:10.922
It is times like that
it is real tough to stay
professional, you know?

08:13.626 --> 08:15.694
- I mean, friggin' seven.
- And plus,

08:15.696 --> 08:17.095
when I win the roseau bowl,

08:17.097 --> 08:19.898
I get like $3,000
in cash and gift cards.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.534
So who's the dummy now?

08:22.536 --> 08:25.136
It's Emily.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.538
And I'll learn you
something else,

08:26.540 --> 08:27.772
Gary down at
the bowling alley

08:27.774 --> 08:29.975
lets me bowl for free
whenever I want.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.510
I'm sorry. Who's Gary?

08:31.512 --> 08:33.745
You know Gary.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.047
The weird dude that works at
the bowling alley.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.717
Oh, are you referring
to Barry?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.284
Could be.

08:40.287 --> 08:43.188
He's the one
with dong broom on his lip

08:43.190 --> 08:44.923
and the toadstool haircut.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.626
I think he might be a little,
derpy derp or something.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.761
You know?
That friggin' guy!

08:49.763 --> 08:51.630
Gunnar's pretty much
one of my best friends.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.666
I mean, it's kind of one of
the perks of working here

08:54.668 --> 08:56.268
and at the movie theater,

08:56.270 --> 08:58.637
uh, where we have
two screens now.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.272
Um, and, uh--

09:00.274 --> 09:02.574
because I get to meet
all the, like, the really,

09:02.576 --> 09:04.676
the popular guys
when they come in and,

09:04.678 --> 09:07.946
but I would,
I'd probably say Gunnar's
the biggest, like, star

09:07.948 --> 09:09.814
that I'm best friends with.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.850
I think he works
at the movie theater, too,

09:11.852 --> 09:14.319
because I went to go see
Jackie chan's "first strike"

09:14.321 --> 09:16.321
because I thought
it was a bowling movie,

09:16.323 --> 09:18.189
and I was way off,

09:18.191 --> 09:21.126
but it was still
a pretty good movie.

09:21.128 --> 09:25.196
It was actually
a really good movie.

09:25.198 --> 09:28.333
Like, super bad-ass movie
if you haven't see it.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.868
But, um...

09:32.872 --> 09:35.840
I'm not quite sure
where I was going
with that, um...

09:37.209 --> 09:39.711
It was a good movie.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.646
You guys should, um,

09:41.648 --> 09:44.716
you should check it out.
It's a pretty good movie.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.693
-You got this. Five more.
-I can't.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.661
Hey, don't you use
that filthy word around me.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.701
Believe it or not,
i used to be quite the bowler.
State champ in high school.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.070
Now I don't mean
to toot my own horn about
that or nothing,

10:05.072 --> 10:06.938
but, you know, toot-toot!

10:06.940 --> 10:08.940
Oh, hon,
don't act like an idiot.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.809
You don't want
people to think
you're an idiot.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.010
'Cause he's not an idiot.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.278
But ever since
the carpal tunnel,

10:13.280 --> 10:14.980
I haven't been able to bowl.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.082
So I spend my free time
training this little lady.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.750
- Aw, hon.
- How, uh,

10:18.752 --> 10:20.285
-how'd you guys meet?
-Ooh.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.020
It's a pretty funny story,
actually.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.922
Hey, why don't you tell him,
sweetheart?

10:23.924 --> 10:26.725
Oh, about how we're cousins
or about where we first met?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.393
Oh, talk about
how we worked together

10:28.395 --> 10:30.261
at Christian brothers
hockey sticks.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.163
-Yeah, but, i--
-we're not cousins.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.399
Well, I think the cousin thing
is a lot more interesting.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.101
Yeah, I definitely want to hear
the cousin thing.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.370
-See, hon, I told ya.
-Okay, first off,

10:38.372 --> 10:41.106
we're not blood cousins.
It's through marriage.

10:41.108 --> 10:44.175
And, uh, second, I feel like
in a town this size,

10:44.177 --> 10:46.711
pretty much
everyone's related,
so, you know?

10:46.713 --> 10:50.048
Hey, what the
are you laughing about? Huh?

10:50.050 --> 10:52.384
You know,
love has no DNA.

10:52.386 --> 10:56.388
So if two cousins fall in love
and want to marry each other,

10:56.390 --> 10:58.657
-then so be it, okay?
-Okay, but again,

10:58.659 --> 11:02.127
I just wanna clarify
that we are not blood cousins.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.663
Okay, we were
already in our thirties
and married

11:04.665 --> 11:06.164
when my mom married her dad.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.899
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.803
Oh, jeez.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.105
Oh, I guess
that makes us siblings.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.974
Whew. Ski-u-mah.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.976
Ah, who gives a?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.678
You know,
my parents are first cousins,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.746
and we all turned out fine.

11:21.748 --> 11:24.916
Well, your brother.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.786
-What?
-I'm just saying.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.888
He's awfully rude.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.223
Well, yeah,
my brother tells rude jokes

11:32.225 --> 11:33.458
-and they're dirty.
-Yeah.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.193
But they're funny as hell.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.430
They're pretty funny,
but they're real dirty.

11:38.432 --> 11:39.698
Tell the one
about the hot dog.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.866
Okay.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.935
So, uh,

11:43.937 --> 11:47.038
uh, one guy is eating
a hot dog

11:47.040 --> 11:48.707
and the other guy says,

11:48.709 --> 11:51.443
"hey, how's that hot dog?"

11:51.445 --> 11:53.144
And then the first guy
takes it

11:53.146 --> 11:55.480
and sticks it in his butt
and says,

11:55.482 --> 11:57.215
"you tell me."

11:57.217 --> 11:59.751
And then
the second guy says, uh,

11:59.753 --> 12:01.753
"whew. Could use
a little more ketchup."

12:01.755 --> 12:04.089
You see?

12:04.091 --> 12:05.790
-'Cause it could
use ketchup.
-Yeah.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.959
'Cause it
tastes like.

12:07.961 --> 12:12.464
You got this,
five, four, three,
two, one.

12:12.466 --> 12:14.199
Nice work. All right.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.367
-Hiya.
-Hey, Emily.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.336
-Oh.
-How's it going?

12:18.338 --> 12:19.871
She's working up
quite a sweat.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.372
-Whew, yeah, look at that.
-Yeah, right?

12:21.374 --> 12:23.074
Whew.
Get some water, huh?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.242
Yeah, little trooper.
Oh, I'll get some.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.777
She's got it all, eh?

12:25.779 --> 12:27.178
Brains,
beauty, athleticism,

12:27.180 --> 12:28.413
willpower, and she's got
the greatest--

12:28.415 --> 12:30.381
are you
talking about me?

12:30.383 --> 12:32.250
What the
are you saying about me?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.419
-Huh?
-Oh, nothing.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.788
-What did you say?
-Whoo.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.790
-Huh?
-She's--

12:38.792 --> 12:40.225
don't talk about me
behind my back.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.360
She's got it
going on right now.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.262
-Don't talk about me
behind my back.
-Okay, I won't, I won't.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.397
-Huh?
-Oh.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.099
-Are you being
naughty right now?
-No, cripes, I'm not.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.801
Ah, I think you need
to get a spanking.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.136
Honey, no.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.470
Okay, uh, let's train.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.340
-Huh?
-Ahem! Come on, Donna.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.208
-All right, back at it.
-Let's do this.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.543
She gets tired
doing those weights,

12:58.545 --> 13:01.146
but when it comes
to the other stuff,

13:01.148 --> 13:04.182
there ain't no stopping her.

13:04.184 --> 13:07.051
-One more, come on.
-No, I can't.

13:07.053 --> 13:10.455
-You can do this.
-Ugh.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.190
-I'm done.
-Ah, come on.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.925
-Donna? Donna? Donna?
-I'm done.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.260
-This isn't gonna happen.
-Donna, look at me.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.528
-Look at me.
-No.

13:16.530 --> 13:19.998
Look at me.
You can do this.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.101
Yes, I believe in ya.
Jeff believes in ya.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.469
-Sure do.
-Not now, Jeff.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.105
-Okie dokie.
-Ya gotta believe in yourself.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.807
Dig deep, Donna.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.409
Come on, let's do it.
Come on! One more.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.579
Ready? Come on.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.281
Do it.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.816
Do it.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.350
Ugh!

13:44.123 --> 13:46.524
-Ugh!
-Yeah!

13:46.526 --> 13:48.526
Whoo!

13:48.528 --> 13:50.228
-Whoo!
-Thanks, guys.
Thanks, guys.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.030
-You did it, babe.
-You did it.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.531
I started to lose faith,

13:53.533 --> 13:55.533
but then I thought
about your cute buns.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.035
-Okay.
-Ah, jeez.

14:05.611 --> 14:08.313
Here's a little something
to put a tickle in your taint.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.014
Gunnar's rolled
three perfect games

14:10.016 --> 14:11.950
in the last three years.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.318
Let's see
if he can go ahead

14:13.320 --> 14:15.186
and do one of those again
for ya today.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.591
I'm gonna learn you
some bowling.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.125
Boom!

14:53.259 --> 14:55.260
no perfect game,
but, uh,

14:55.262 --> 14:57.395
238 ain't nothing
to scoff at.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.364
Ugh.

14:59.366 --> 15:02.000
Hey, Barry,
why don't you stop
staring at us

15:02.002 --> 15:05.003
and score us
some soft pretzels?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.671
He's so weird.

15:06.673 --> 15:10.074
I got some
press to do tomorrow,
for this tournament.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.076
You know,
it's a life of an athlete.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.945
You gotta do the p.R.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.114
Local news thing?

15:16.116 --> 15:20.118
No, Emily's,
uh, video on a.O.L.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.487
Yeah, she's got
a video show on there.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.322
Jeez Louise.

15:24.324 --> 15:27.025
Look at the ass
on that hockey mom.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.226
Whoa.

15:30.162 --> 15:33.031
You gotta get the people out
no matter what it takes.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.034
I'm trying to get paid.
Sweet cheddar cheese, baby.

15:37.369 --> 15:39.537
Over the line!

15:39.539 --> 15:43.041
If Emily lets you,
you should come watch,

15:43.043 --> 15:46.044
because I have a lot in store
for that interview.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.512
You're gonna wanna be there.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.250
You guys are gonna
love bjorn.

15:52.252 --> 15:55.119
Oh, look, there he is.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.688
-Hey, sis, how goes it?
-Oh, it goes, you know?

15:56.690 --> 15:58.089
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.424
-Good to hear.
-You betcha.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.259
So do you wanna
go straight to the alley?

16:01.261 --> 16:03.494
Or you think we got time to
stop by Doug's sandwich shop

16:03.496 --> 16:05.096
and pick up a couple
of quick subs?

16:05.098 --> 16:06.965
Well, let's see.
Your practice is at 3:30, yeah?

16:06.967 --> 16:09.600
-All right.
I'd say we got time.
-Oh, good.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.302
I'm a starvin' Marvin
right about now.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.271
-Ooh, wow.
-You know, if you buy

16:13.273 --> 16:15.039
two foot-long subs from Doug's
with all the fixin's,

16:15.041 --> 16:16.374
you get a free
fountain drink.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.209
-No kiddin'.
-No kiddin'.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.211
I heard it
on the radio there.
Two-foot long subs

16:20.213 --> 16:22.547
with all the fixin's,
free fountain drink.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.549
Well, jeez, they leave us
no choice, do they?

16:24.551 --> 16:27.051
You're telling me.

16:27.053 --> 16:30.054
Em's my baby sister.
Now I know what you're saying.

16:30.056 --> 16:32.557
-"But you look so young."
-Ah, jeez.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.425
No? Okay. Anywho,

16:34.427 --> 16:36.761
we been carpooling ever
since she started teaching.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.297
Mm-hmm. Well, you know,
we're both teachers,

16:39.299 --> 16:42.000
but bjorn coaches
the bowling team.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.535
We got a great team
this year.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.771
-Mm-hmm.
-Like I always say,

16:46.773 --> 16:48.406
"strength in numbers."

16:48.408 --> 16:50.708
We got nearly eight kids
going out for a squad.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.544
Now, come on,
you're gonna have a great team
'cause you're the coach.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.413
Now don't get it twisted.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.515
Em here got
all the talent
in the family.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.350
I mean,
i know how to coach bowling,

16:59.352 --> 17:02.153
but I can't
pick up a 5-8-10 split
to save my life.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.155
Em here can do it
in her sleep.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.656
He's just being modest.

17:05.657 --> 17:07.657
Well, you know what
Woody Allen says?

17:07.660 --> 17:10.194
-Hmm?
-"Those who can't do, teach.

17:10.195 --> 17:13.330
And those who can't teach,
teach gym."

17:18.404 --> 17:20.738
Oh, man.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.775
-Bjorn's a gym teacher.
-I teach gym.

17:39.793 --> 17:43.494
ah, shoot!
Shoot! Shoot!

17:43.496 --> 17:46.664
Would ya look at that,
for fudge sake!

17:46.666 --> 17:48.666
-That was good.
-What're you talking about?
That was awful.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.369
-What're you patronizing me?
-No, it was good.

17:51.371 --> 17:54.072
You just need to adjust
about a half step to your left.

17:54.074 --> 17:57.275
Try taking it two boards over.
You got it.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.776
You're lucky you're so hot,
you.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.845
-Oh, stop it.
-Well, ya are.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.714
-Okay.
-You're my hot piece of meat.

18:03.716 --> 18:07.151
-Please.
-Come one. Come on.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.653
No, you're catching
the fire department here.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.254
All right, fine.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.390
-But when we get home.
-Okay.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.438
-hey.
-Oh, how'd you do that?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.507
I didn't do it.
You did.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.742
-You're amazing sometimes.
-I know you are,

18:31.744 --> 18:33.444
but what am I?

18:33.446 --> 18:35.446
-My hot piece of meat.
-Oh, okay, all right.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.148
-It's what you are.
-Okay, I know, I know.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.150
I'm serious about
when we get home.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.652
Yeah, okay,
just no hair pulling
this time, okay?

18:41.654 --> 18:43.654
-It hurts.
-Okay.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.490
-All right.
-I'll be easy on you.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.493
-Yeah, so you say that now.
-I am gonna eat you up, though.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.795
I know, I know.
I'm scared.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.230
All right,
get back up on that Lane.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.631
Oh, yeah,
we know Gunnar.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.801
He's a second cousin
twice removed

18:56.803 --> 18:59.270
or something like that.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.872
He's not close related
that's all I know.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.607
Ah, not this again.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.509
I mean,
I'm not really sure
how to put this,

19:04.511 --> 19:06.844
but you know how we all
got that one relative

19:06.846 --> 19:11.349
that's just, uh,
well, not as pleasant?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.818
And after what he did
to Emily's father, you know?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.187
- He's an.
- He-- oh.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.189
The guy's an , Jeff.
You can say it.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.825
- He's an.
- I'm not gonna.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.294
Say it.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.296
Just say it.
It feels good to say
the truth.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.332
-Okay, okay.
-Say it.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.368
He's an.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.937
There you go.
See, now doesn't that
feel better?

19:32.939 --> 19:34.872
Now my stomach hurts.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.543
You shouldn't have
had that grilled cheese.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.645
I couldn't help it.

19:40.647 --> 19:44.248
It looked so good.
It was piping hot.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.317
But it's also
'cause of what I just said.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.487
Yep, I'm ready
when you're ready.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.355
I want you to be
my cheerleader.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.357
You better believe it.
That's what I was born to do.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.262
Okay, here we go.

19:58.264 --> 19:59.597
All right,
all right, all right.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.533
Here we go,
go, go, go, yeah!

20:02.535 --> 20:05.536
-Oh!
-Still just one.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.872
Hey, that's closer
than last time, you know?

20:07.874 --> 20:09.574
-I know, you're right.
-Yep, you're doing great.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.443
-I should be happy.
-Yeah, you should be.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.445
You're incredible.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.781
-She's incredible.
-What'd you say?

20:16.783 --> 20:18.516
I said you're incredible.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.885
Emily's been great with her,
just a real good coach.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.321
Super patient.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.423
She couldn't
be here today 'cause she's
preparing her video show

20:25.425 --> 20:27.291
on the YouTube tomorrow.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.960
Boy, oh, boy.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.661
You'll see a real difference
in Donna's game

20:30.663 --> 20:32.997
when Emily's around.

20:32.999 --> 20:36.000
Well, in the meantime though,
we're making do.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.479
So why did you agree
to have him on?

20:48.481 --> 20:50.815
Publicity, you know?

20:50.817 --> 20:52.984
Like, when Gunnar's on
we get the views,

20:52.986 --> 20:54.752
so just make it perfect.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.287
Yeah, I'm with Kenny.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.755
Gunnar's a total douche, babe.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.690
Don't call me babe.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.392
I'm no one's babe.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.561
Emily always gets like this
when Gunnar's around.

21:03.563 --> 21:06.430
He really
got under her skin.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.965
Dude totally friggin' sucks.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.568
We're all on your side, Emily.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.437
There's only one way
to describe the way he treated
you after the tournament.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.772
Uncool.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.441
Totally uncalled for.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.578
That's what I'm screaming.
The dude's a friggin' dick.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.447
I choked in the third game.
I did.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.682
And, uh,

21:24.684 --> 21:28.019
afterward, he got all up
in my bubble,

21:28.021 --> 21:30.755
you know,
shouting real loud,

21:30.757 --> 21:32.890
you know, and then he started
doing that mooning thing

21:32.892 --> 21:34.592
where you share
your bare naked bottom,

21:34.594 --> 21:35.960
wiggling it back and forth.

21:38.563 --> 21:41.632
And then he farted...

21:41.634 --> 21:43.668
While his pants were down.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.536
And, uh,

21:45.538 --> 21:48.406
I don't know
if maybe he pooped
a little bit,

21:48.408 --> 21:53.344
because the smell was...

21:53.346 --> 21:55.746
Real bad, you know,
and it got up in my nose,

21:55.748 --> 22:00.451
and with like
no filter or nothing.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.653
And, uh--

22:02.655 --> 22:06.657
and, uh,
then my dad stepped in.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.460
And, um,

22:09.462 --> 22:12.697
anyway, so, you know,
it made all the papers,
of course,

22:12.699 --> 22:15.433
and, uh,
there was one headline
that read, uh,

22:15.435 --> 22:19.070
"'choking on farts,'
starring Emily baardsson."

22:19.072 --> 22:22.606
So, yeah,
I'm not in the best mood
when he's around.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.775
But, you know, I, uh--

22:24.777 --> 22:26.510
I gotta get those views.

22:26.512 --> 22:29.780
Got to get those views.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.950
Hey, em, uh,
yeah, maybe after this,

22:32.952 --> 22:34.618
you know, if you needed
to wind down a bit,

22:34.620 --> 22:36.620
take the edge off,

22:36.622 --> 22:39.423
you know,
we could go get some drinks?
Just you, just me.

22:39.425 --> 22:42.426
Papa Nick's buying!

22:42.428 --> 22:45.429
-Yeah, yeah, I'd like that.
-Right, all right, great.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.498
But, you know,
like, as friends, yeah?

22:47.500 --> 22:51.369
Yeah, friends,
more than friends,
future couple.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.871
-You know, either way.
-Nick, come on.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.873
You know I'm not into guys.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.875
Never have been.
Never will be.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.578
There I said it.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.547
Not all lesbians look like
al franken, you know.

23:07.853 --> 23:10.154
It's, uh--
it's a joke I like to tell.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.525
Nick really
has to let that one go.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.127
I mean,
i know he's into her
and everything,

23:16.129 --> 23:21.866
but... he's barking up
the wrong tree.

23:21.868 --> 23:25.035
I can't get enough of her.
She's, seriously, like,

23:25.037 --> 23:27.405
the omega babe
of the century.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.407
You know,
she's the end all
to be all babes.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.876
She is the mayor
of babe city U.S.A.,

23:31.878 --> 23:34.512
and I am voting for her
every year.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.814
But, yeah, I just gotta
respect her, though,

23:36.816 --> 23:38.883
you know, 'cause she's--
she's super cool,

23:38.885 --> 23:42.153
and, uh, she's a great friend,
and so friendship it is.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.162
What kinda question is that?

23:51.164 --> 23:52.997
Of course
Gunnar plans to win.

23:52.999 --> 23:55.166
Seems that's all
he ever does really.

23:55.168 --> 23:59.703
Win. Me. Champion.
Greatest ever.

23:59.705 --> 24:02.673
These are words I've become
to be known ab-- about.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.842
They get used
about me a bunch.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.644
I mean,
it's no surprise.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.646
I've won ten out of
the last 12 roseau bowls,

24:08.648 --> 24:10.648
including the last
seven straight.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.149
-Now...
-Including, also--

24:12.151 --> 24:15.119
also including
the 2010 roseau bowl.

24:16.855 --> 24:19.857
Which was the last time
they had the open bracket.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.193
You know that they
closed it down?

24:22.195 --> 24:24.962
Because I beat you
so bad, right?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.530
That's not why
they closed it.

24:26.532 --> 24:28.232
Yeah, it is.
You remember that?

24:28.234 --> 24:30.768
Remember I put my butt
in your face and I farted?

24:30.770 --> 24:32.770
Remember when I farted
in your face?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.071
Yeah! You know, what? Yeah!

24:34.073 --> 24:35.773
Yeah, I remember,
you stupid idiot!

24:35.775 --> 24:37.107
Jeez, who do you think
you are, huh?

24:37.109 --> 24:37.107
You know if you--

24:37.109 --> 24:40.644
if your balls were in the gutter
half as much as your mind,

24:40.646 --> 24:42.246
-you'd be bowling zeros.
-That's right.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.181
I am that guy.

24:44.183 --> 24:47.852
I'm also the guy calling you out
for this year's roseau bowl.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.721
That's right.
You versus me, toots,

24:50.723 --> 24:55.593
on the hardwood.

25:00.265 --> 25:01.765
Gunnar.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.905
You know, I'm, uh,

25:07.907 --> 25:10.040
I'm retired.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.976
And, uh,
i gotta lot on my plate.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.978
You know, I got a job,

25:13.980 --> 25:17.848
and I, uh,
i got my aunt Donna
who's bowling.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.850
And, I, you know,
i couldn't ever bowl
against her.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.552
-Huh.
-And, I, and I got,

25:21.554 --> 25:24.221
I got book clubs
on Tuesdays.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.757
-And I got tons of shows...
-Horse hockey!

25:26.759 --> 25:29.760
-Building up on my dvr.
-In its purest form.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.629
Absolute horse hockey!

25:31.631 --> 25:33.631
You don't have too much
on your plate.

25:33.633 --> 25:37.167
And Donna's a moron.
You're a chicken.

25:37.169 --> 25:42.172
Duck, duck, gray duck,
you're a chicken.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.745
You tore my family apart!

25:47.747 --> 25:49.747
And I want
nothing to do with you

25:49.749 --> 25:51.615
and your stupid challenge!

26:01.259 --> 26:03.327
And that's all the time
we have for today.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.195
So, um,

26:05.197 --> 26:08.198
please tune in next week
when we discuss the importance

26:08.200 --> 26:10.701
of different
size finger holes...

26:10.703 --> 26:13.203
Finger holes?

26:13.205 --> 26:15.205
Did you hear what she said?

26:15.207 --> 26:17.207
And, uh,
I'm Emily baardsson
and, uh...

26:17.209 --> 26:19.243
Oh, I can't believe
you just said that.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.779
-This is how I roll.
-Finger holes!

26:21.781 --> 26:23.948
- Gunnar!
- I can't believe it.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.816
-Gunnar, get out!
-Where are we going?

26:25.818 --> 26:27.351
Seriously, Gunnar,
get outta here.

26:27.353 --> 26:30.354
You guys want a selfie
or something before I leave?

26:30.356 --> 26:33.057
Jeez.
Thanks for having me, Emily.

26:33.059 --> 26:36.160
I don't know,
you know, he's--

26:36.162 --> 26:38.862
I just got all rattled
and I, I was,

26:38.864 --> 26:42.366
-was I too mean?
-No.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.368
I mean,
i got real upset,

26:44.370 --> 26:46.070
man, I cannot stand that guy.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.606
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'll be fine, thanks.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.107
Good. You really
nailed him, though,

26:50.109 --> 26:51.942
with that
balls in that gutter line.

26:51.944 --> 26:52.943
Huh?

26:55.380 --> 26:58.916
Oh, jeez,
no, I meant, like--
aw, dang.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.718
Oh, I know I'm,
like, uh, aw, jeez.

27:12.897 --> 27:13.931
-Yes!
-Whoo!

27:13.933 --> 27:15.633
There you go, Donna.

27:15.635 --> 27:16.967
You know,
you've got that power,

27:16.969 --> 27:18.669
and it is all about
that follow-through.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.004
It felt real good.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.338
-It looked real good.
-Yeah.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.707
You're like
a sniper out there.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.242
Okay, so for this
next time, though,

27:25.244 --> 27:27.211
I'm gonna have you take a
step and a half to your right.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.412
Mm-hmm.

27:28.414 --> 27:29.847
Ease up on that spin
just a touch.

27:29.849 --> 27:30.948
-Okay.
-Okay?

27:30.950 --> 27:33.117
-Mm-hmm.
-You got this.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.219
-Here she goes.
-Heart's pounding.

27:39.724 --> 27:40.991
-Whoo!
-Oh, man!

27:40.993 --> 27:42.693
Yes! That was unbelievable.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.862
-Yeah!
-You two are good together.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.964
Oh, yeah, we are.
It's all her, though.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.699
-Yeah.
-You know, uh,

27:48.701 --> 27:50.034
I saw that
interview with Gunnar.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.036
Did you now?

27:52.038 --> 27:53.370
Well, I'm sorry
you had to see that.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.072
Well, you wanna know
what I think?

27:55.074 --> 27:56.774
Maybe not.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.342
You know, maybe we just
sweep this one under the rug?

27:58.344 --> 28:00.444
Well, I think
you should take him down.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.713
I wouldn't be mad.

28:02.715 --> 28:04.214
You're the best bowler I know.

28:04.216 --> 28:06.316
Come on, now,
you know I can't do that.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.318
No, no,
i don't know that.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.955
I know you'd beat me,
that much I know.

28:11.957 --> 28:13.357
After everything
that he's put you through,

28:13.359 --> 28:14.925
you're the only one
who can shut him up,

28:14.927 --> 28:17.227
and somebody
needs to shut him up.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.463
You know,
i know they do,

28:19.465 --> 28:21.799
and I'm training the person
that's gonna do it.

28:21.801 --> 28:24.435
Okay, you know I truly,
truly believe that.

28:24.437 --> 28:26.103
Just to be clear,
you two are talking about...

28:26.105 --> 28:27.971
Yes, I'm talking
about Donna, Jeff.

28:27.973 --> 28:29.473
Yeah, Jeff, who'd you think
she was talking about?

28:29.475 --> 28:32.476
-She's training me.
-Yeah.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.945
-Doesn't that make sense?
-You're the one.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.915
Sometimes you can be
a real dummy, you know that?

28:37.917 --> 28:39.717
You know, if you weren't
such a steaming

28:39.719 --> 28:42.953
hot piece of yum-yum,
i don't know what I'd do.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.388
Look at you.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.924
Ooh!
It's like Hercules.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.859
What? We did some
groceries today.

28:48.861 --> 28:49.993
-Yeah.
-Yes, you did.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.361
-Let me see those buns.
-Okay.

28:53.164 --> 28:54.798
Of course I'm gonna
win it this year,

28:54.800 --> 28:56.867
unless some
freak accident happens.

28:56.869 --> 29:00.738
I mean, my biggest competition
right now is Donna.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.273
You heard me. Donna!

29:03.275 --> 29:06.777
Friggin' Donna!
Who the heck is Donna?

29:08.379 --> 29:11.482
I mean, I'm what
the bowling community

29:11.484 --> 29:13.951
refers to as a cranker.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.920
C-a-r, no.
C-r-a-n,

29:16.922 --> 29:22.059
yeah, c-r-a-n,
c-r-a-n-k-e-r.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.460
Cranker. Right?

29:23.462 --> 29:24.962
Ain't too many people
in a bowling alley

29:24.964 --> 29:27.931
that can do
what it is that I can do.

29:27.933 --> 29:31.235
What I do is I come
with a high backswing,

29:31.237 --> 29:32.936
I square my shoulders,

29:32.938 --> 29:34.805
and then
i put a lot of spin
on the ball,

29:34.807 --> 29:36.373
and then I just let 'er rip.

29:36.375 --> 29:39.076
I get as close
to the line as possible

29:39.078 --> 29:40.811
and then I just release.

29:40.813 --> 29:43.814
You know,
it's a plant and pull.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.382
So, plant and then pull.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.117
Far as I'm concerned,

29:47.119 --> 29:49.820
that's the best way to get
a big hook on your ball.

29:49.822 --> 29:53.991
You know, I mean,
of course you know.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.893
Unless you're
a friggin' idiot.

29:57.262 --> 29:59.930
Bowling is like life to me.
Frame by frame,

29:59.932 --> 30:01.431
no apologies.

30:01.433 --> 30:05.435
Gunnar does what Gunnar does,
and he never looks back.

30:05.437 --> 30:08.438
Emily can blame me all she wants
for what happened,

30:08.440 --> 30:11.809
but she's the one that needs
to look in the mirror.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.811
You know, as far as
I'm concerned,

30:13.813 --> 30:15.279
if she didn't choke,

30:15.281 --> 30:17.047
everybody would be
alive and well

30:17.049 --> 30:20.050
singing "Kumbaya"
and.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.452
But she choked
at the end of the game,

30:22.454 --> 30:24.388
and I just let her
know about it.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.390
And that's my fault?

30:26.392 --> 30:28.091
That makes me the bad guy?

30:28.093 --> 30:29.493
I don't think so.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.361
And I'll learn you
something else,

30:31.363 --> 30:32.896
America don't think so either.

30:32.898 --> 30:34.198
Boom!

30:52.150 --> 30:54.985
Okay, you know,
not bad, not bad.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.854
What am I gonna
tell ya though?

30:56.856 --> 30:58.989
Uh, that I didn't
follow through.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.490
Exactly.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.559
You know,
bowling is like life.

31:02.561 --> 31:05.229
You gotta follow through.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.530
Lose or lose,

31:06.532 --> 31:07.598
Follow through.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.066
Okay, I know, I know.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.367
Two weeks to go,
you know.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.236
We gotta get this
every single time.

31:12.238 --> 31:14.238
Okay, you got it.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.639
Things are really
heating up here.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.341
Can I tell ya,

31:17.343 --> 31:19.643
we need Emily now
more than ever.

31:19.645 --> 31:22.045
Ever since I got a promotion
at Christian brothers,

31:22.047 --> 31:25.582
I just don't have
nearly the time needed.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.885
But I'd say we're in
pretty good hands.

31:27.887 --> 31:30.187
-Yes! Whoo!
-Nailed it!

31:30.189 --> 31:33.223
Yes, you did. Do it.

31:33.225 --> 31:36.093
Do I think she can win?

31:36.095 --> 31:37.661
No telling, really,
i guess.

31:37.663 --> 31:40.197
Uh, but she's doing
really good, you know?

31:40.199 --> 31:43.200
Bowling the best
she ever has.

31:43.202 --> 31:45.535
Is it enough to beat Gunnar?

31:45.537 --> 31:48.672
I don't know.
Your guess is as good as mine.

31:48.674 --> 31:51.208
But here's one thing
i will say,

31:51.210 --> 31:53.477
nothing's gonna stop her
from trying.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.112
You know,
she's gonna get out there,

31:55.114 --> 31:56.513
and she's gonna do her best.

31:56.515 --> 31:59.216
That much I can guarantee.

31:59.218 --> 32:02.920
- Aah!
- Are you okay?

32:02.922 --> 32:04.154
My back.

32:04.156 --> 32:07.024
I think
it's my latissimus dorsi!

32:07.026 --> 32:09.459
She's speaking gibberish.

32:09.461 --> 32:12.062
It's okay, Donna.
Just breathe, okay?

32:12.064 --> 32:14.398
-It's gonna be okay.
-No, it's not.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.567
Last time this happened,
i couldn't bowl for a month.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.303
-Oh, I think it's torn.
-Donna, Donna.

32:19.305 --> 32:22.272
-I think it's torn.
-It's gonna be okay.

32:22.274 --> 32:26.109
No, I'm not gonna be okay.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.946
This town needs you, Emily.

32:28.948 --> 32:31.548
Your family needs you.

32:31.550 --> 32:37.220
I need you to bowl for me.

32:43.394 --> 32:45.062
You really think she's gonna
announce it on air?

32:45.064 --> 32:46.496
Dude, you never know.

32:46.498 --> 32:50.033
She could be
a total wildcard at times.

32:50.035 --> 32:51.702
No, no, it's gotta be
about the tournament.

32:51.704 --> 32:54.504
So we've been told Emily
has a pretty big announcement

32:54.506 --> 32:56.440
-to make on her show today.
-I think she's gonna be

32:56.442 --> 32:58.141
announcing that she's
entering the tournament.

32:58.143 --> 33:02.379
Kenny's probably right,
but, man, fingers crossed.

33:02.381 --> 33:05.449
If she's announcing that
she's gonna try dudes today,

33:05.451 --> 33:08.385
pretty good chance
that my long hair bumps me
to the front of the line.

33:08.387 --> 33:10.253
Dude, I'm just saying
if it's gonna be anybody,

33:10.255 --> 33:13.123
-it's probably gonna me.
-What would be you?

33:13.125 --> 33:15.993
Uh, we hear
you got some news.

33:15.995 --> 33:18.161
-Huh?
-The show.

33:18.163 --> 33:21.031
We hear you got
a big announcement to make.

33:21.033 --> 33:24.501
Oh, yeah, big time.
Get ready...

33:24.503 --> 33:28.038
For me to enter the roseau bowl
tournament this year.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.473
You say you're not scared?

33:29.475 --> 33:33.176
Well, I got 288 reasons
for you to be scared,

33:33.178 --> 33:35.512
you frickin' little baby.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.148
That's what I bowled
yesterday and, uh,

33:38.150 --> 33:41.151
and those were also
the reasons.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.220
Well, I got the best friggin'
coach in Minnesota,

33:43.222 --> 33:47.624
and I'm coming
to whoop your behind,
pardon my French.

33:47.626 --> 33:51.194
I'm Emily baardsson,
and this is how I roll.

33:55.233 --> 33:56.733
Is 288 a good score?

33:59.203 --> 34:02.139
Sure, it's darn good.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.074
But you know what
that means, right?

34:04.076 --> 34:05.609
It means
she choked in the end.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.310
Last frame.

34:07.312 --> 34:10.313
When it comes down to the wire,
she's gonna choke.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.760
she always does.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.695
I don't know the exact
science behind it,

34:25.697 --> 34:28.565
but it had something to do
with a woman competing.

34:28.567 --> 34:32.101
Now I'm gonna choose my words
real careful here.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.603
It's just like--

34:33.605 --> 34:36.440
like their reproductive parts
or something remind them

34:36.442 --> 34:39.141
that if they ever
want to have babies

34:39.143 --> 34:41.110
their body
won't even let them win.

34:41.112 --> 34:44.347
Like, again,
i don't know the exact
science behind it,

34:44.349 --> 34:47.350
but it was something
i read online once on a.O.L.,

34:47.351 --> 34:50.219
and it was in a chat room.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.500
you know,
you never know, though.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.503
I mean, you can't believe
everything you read online.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.839
Plus, how do I know
she wasn't one of those freaks

35:08.841 --> 35:11.641
born with girl
and boy parts?

35:11.643 --> 35:15.345
Then all the science goes
right down the drain.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.347
Everybody knows that.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.683
So Gunnar
just has to train
his ass off,

35:19.685 --> 35:21.284
and that's what Gunnar does.

35:23.588 --> 35:26.556
Oh, yeah, that's much better.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.258
Yeah, you know,
i don't see the point of this.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.861
Uh, to strengthen your
backswing, doy!

35:30.863 --> 35:32.529
Hey, don't doy me.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.464
Okay, follow-through
is the most important thing,

35:34.466 --> 35:35.866
so I don't know why we're
working the friggin' backswing

35:35.868 --> 35:37.501
when we should be working on
follow-through.

35:37.503 --> 35:40.370
Jeepers, em.
No need to get all worked up.

35:40.372 --> 35:41.671
You just need to have
a well-rounded game.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.607
Yeah, I know.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.208
You think you can
torque the ball enough

35:45.210 --> 35:46.543
to take down a 5-7 split,

35:46.545 --> 35:48.245
or heaven forbid, a 7-10,

35:48.247 --> 35:51.214
with your dinky backswing?

35:51.216 --> 35:52.649
Jeez.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.519
"Jeez" is right.
No siree Bob, you can't.

35:55.521 --> 35:58.822
Now we don't have much time,
and we need to get you there.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.824
-Okay.
-Okay.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.926
- Eye of the tiger.
- Strike.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.533
Torque it!
Torque it! Torque it!

36:09.535 --> 36:12.402
Strike, strike, strike,
strike, strike!

36:14.372 --> 36:16.673
Strike, strike, strike,
strike, strike!

36:23.848 --> 36:25.615
Torque it!
Torque it! Torque it!

36:25.617 --> 36:27.350
93, 94, 95...

36:27.352 --> 36:29.686
You're doing great.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.389
96, 97, 98, 99, 100!

36:32.391 --> 36:33.823
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

36:33.825 --> 36:35.759
Let's take it to the lanes!

36:35.761 --> 36:38.929
Yes, let's take it
to the lanes, also, too.

36:38.931 --> 36:40.463
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

36:40.465 --> 36:41.631
-Strike!
-Strike!

36:47.638 --> 36:49.339
-Whooshka!
-Order a tater tot hot dish,

36:49.341 --> 36:51.208
'cause she just
smashed the potatoes.

36:51.210 --> 36:53.243
Those pins
don't stand a chance.

36:55.246 --> 36:56.279
Whoo!

37:04.622 --> 37:05.956
-Oh!
-Oh!

37:05.958 --> 37:07.290
-One more, one more.
-One more.

37:07.292 --> 37:08.325
Okay.

37:15.866 --> 37:17.367
Whoo!

37:22.740 --> 37:24.541
Now are you ready
to take on Gunnar?

37:24.543 --> 37:26.610
Ready as I'll ever be, yes.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.351
Whoo!

37:36.354 --> 37:38.521
This isn't just one of those
Hollywood movies

37:38.523 --> 37:41.858
where a girl
is just going after a man.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.827
Unless you count the man
on the top of the trophy,

37:43.829 --> 37:46.763
which I guess
i kinda am going after.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.865
Dang. Eh.

37:57.041 --> 37:58.575
Whoo!

37:58.577 --> 38:00.443
There are times
in a person's life

38:00.445 --> 38:02.045
where they can't lose,

38:02.047 --> 38:03.813
and that's me right now.

38:03.815 --> 38:04.948
I can't lose.

38:07.051 --> 38:09.653
Unless someone bowls
a higher score than me,

38:09.655 --> 38:12.756
and then I would lose.

38:12.758 --> 38:16.860
But I feel real good
about that not happening.

38:16.862 --> 38:18.995
Probably, to me.

38:18.997 --> 38:21.498
Wow. Powerful stuff, em.

38:26.070 --> 38:28.071
Oh, yeah, I heard all right,
you betcha.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.073
Yeah, Emily coming back
could not be better

38:30.075 --> 38:31.775
for a whole slew
of reasons.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.410
I mean, she will bring

38:33.412 --> 38:35.011
literally dozens
of fans with her,

38:35.013 --> 38:36.579
and more people to feed

38:36.581 --> 38:38.081
just equals
more concession money.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.516
That's just
an old-fashioned
blend of math

38:39.518 --> 38:41.985
and common sense
right there.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.688
Barry,
you're five minutes late.

38:44.690 --> 38:45.989
But crap,
I'm 25 minutes early.

38:48.559 --> 38:51.027
I gotcha.
Just testing ya.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.730
Nah, I'm a fun boss.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.865
But, seriously,
we like to joke around
about here.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.767
So, yeah. Hey, Adam.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.069
Hey, you coming to
the roseau bowl this year?

38:59.071 --> 39:00.970
-You betcha.
-See?

39:00.972 --> 39:03.873
Adam hasn't been
to a roseau bowl in
three, four years.

39:03.875 --> 39:08.511
So not only will Emily
bring more fans with her,

39:08.513 --> 39:10.780
I just hope
she can get redemption

39:10.782 --> 39:13.616
from what happened
last time.

39:13.618 --> 39:18.688
What happened
to my cousin, her dad,

39:18.690 --> 39:21.558
it's inexcusable.
It makes me sick.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.893
- Did she tell ya about that?
- About the fart?

39:23.895 --> 39:26.096
Oh, no siree.
No, Gunnar--

39:26.098 --> 39:27.997
Gunnar, he took it
much further.

39:30.835 --> 39:34.671
It got ugly,
that's all I can say.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.973
I'll leave her to tell ya
the rest about that.

39:38.776 --> 39:40.710
Barry! Quit sleeping
on the job!

39:40.712 --> 39:42.412
I'm not. Frickin' eyes
are wide open.

39:42.414 --> 39:44.147
I was putting my lunch
in the friggin' thing.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.915
-I'm just testing ya.
-Freakin' blueberries and--

39:45.917 --> 39:48.051
every stinkin' time.
Every stinkin' time.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.160
Warming up, baby.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.928
Gotta have those
game day rituals.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.897
How many do you have?

40:03.467 --> 40:04.968
How long are you guys
gonna be here?

40:04.970 --> 40:07.103
Because I got a friggin'
crapload of 'em.

40:15.479 --> 40:18.648
No, I don't anything
real special to prepare.

40:18.650 --> 40:21.151
I'm just grading some
papers right here,

40:21.153 --> 40:23.019
and I'll probably
call Donna in a bit,

40:23.021 --> 40:24.754
see how she's doing.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.856
Honestly, it's really
just a normal day for me

40:26.858 --> 40:28.958
before I head on down
to the alley.

40:28.960 --> 40:32.095
So you don't have any
superstitions or anything?

40:32.097 --> 40:33.730
Oh, gag me with a spoon.

40:44.208 --> 40:49.078
48, 49, 50.

40:55.586 --> 40:58.922
All part of the process
of being great,

40:58.924 --> 41:01.925
you gotta get the sugar
out of the cereal,

41:01.927 --> 41:04.627
but if you let it digest,

41:04.629 --> 41:07.497
you get all
the bad carbs, too.

41:07.499 --> 41:08.665
A little secret
i came up with

41:08.667 --> 41:10.900
to get the best
of both worlds.

41:28.953 --> 41:30.253
50...

41:34.024 --> 41:36.559
I know I have
what it takes to win.

41:36.561 --> 41:39.262
I've prepared
the way I need to win.

41:39.264 --> 41:40.897
Superstitions?

41:40.899 --> 41:43.032
They're really just
another form of fear.

41:43.034 --> 41:47.203
That's a interesting way
to look at it.

41:47.205 --> 41:49.906
The way I see it,
if I win,

41:49.908 --> 41:51.908
it's 'cause
i was the best that day.

41:51.910 --> 41:54.744
If I lose,
it's 'cause I wasn't
good enough.

41:54.746 --> 41:57.614
This is the most important part
of the morning ritual.

41:57.616 --> 42:00.884
I gotta put
my underwear on inside out.

42:00.886 --> 42:02.519
Well, why's that?

42:02.521 --> 42:04.587
Uh, 12 years ago,

42:04.589 --> 42:06.256
I was on day three
of my underwear

42:06.258 --> 42:08.258
the day of the competition.

42:08.260 --> 42:10.727
Obviously,
you don't wanna smell,

42:10.729 --> 42:13.029
so I put them on inside out

42:13.031 --> 42:15.231
to squeeze one more day
out of the deal.

42:15.233 --> 42:18.535
That was the first time
i took home the gold.

42:18.537 --> 42:20.103
Ever since then,

42:20.105 --> 42:21.838
even if I've only
worn them one day

42:21.840 --> 42:23.706
or none days,

42:23.708 --> 42:27.644
I still turn them on inside out
the day of the tournament.

42:27.646 --> 42:29.746
I forgot to two times,

42:29.748 --> 42:32.081
and those are the two years
i got second.

42:32.083 --> 42:37.020
Coincidence?
No. Fact.

42:37.022 --> 42:39.756
You think you need to do that
to beat Emily as well?

42:39.758 --> 42:43.293
Ha! So funny
i forget to laugh.

42:43.295 --> 42:45.194
You know what?
You're right.

42:45.196 --> 42:47.564
I'm gonna put 'em on regular
just to prove a point.

42:49.633 --> 42:53.636
Eh, I probably better just
put 'em on inside out.

42:53.638 --> 42:57.106
I mean, I'm coming up
on day seven now.

42:57.108 --> 42:59.275
It has nothing
to do with Emily.

42:59.277 --> 43:00.977
You know, it's not gonna make
a lick of difference

43:00.979 --> 43:02.912
if I put on
some magical t-shirt,

43:02.914 --> 43:06.716
if I put
my underpants inside out,
that's just fear.

43:06.718 --> 43:09.218
So you know about Gunnar?

43:09.220 --> 43:11.120
Huh?

43:11.122 --> 43:12.956
Gunnar puts his
underwear inside out

43:12.958 --> 43:14.691
the day of the tournament.

43:14.693 --> 43:15.758
No.

43:18.028 --> 43:18.995
No.

43:20.297 --> 43:21.764
No.

43:25.736 --> 43:27.337
Get outta town.

43:30.240 --> 43:33.109
No, no, no, no. No!

43:33.111 --> 43:36.245
This is happening.
Gunnar versus Emily.

43:36.247 --> 43:38.381
The epic showdown
that'll make

43:38.383 --> 43:41.818
the federation-klingon
war of 2372

43:41.820 --> 43:45.321
look like the vrash slaughter
by the people of pasik.

43:45.323 --> 43:48.858
That's right.
Gunnar's got this.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.360
Me and Gunnar,

43:50.362 --> 43:52.862
we're gonna be the stars
of the show.

43:52.864 --> 43:55.064
Why you?

43:55.066 --> 43:56.766
Oh, you didn't--
you didn't hear?

43:56.768 --> 44:00.637
Um, they chose--
they chose me to be the guy

44:00.639 --> 44:05.141
who sings
the usa national anthem
for the bowling thing.

44:05.143 --> 44:08.211
So, uh,

44:08.213 --> 44:12.181
if you guys wanted,
i could probably give you
a little sneak pre--

44:23.427 --> 44:24.661
Emily?

44:25.929 --> 44:28.398
Em?

44:28.400 --> 44:31.034
Hey, em,
it's Nick.

44:31.036 --> 44:33.302
Long hair don't care.

44:33.304 --> 44:35.071
Back hair don't care.

44:35.073 --> 44:37.073
Time to go
to the tournament, em.

44:37.075 --> 44:38.775
Time to bowl some strikes,

44:38.777 --> 44:40.777
get some spares.

44:42.346 --> 44:47.150
Emily, are you all right?

44:47.152 --> 44:50.720
Heck no. No, I'm--
I'm sick, you know?

44:50.722 --> 44:52.955
I'm sicker than a dog
in an ice fishing hole.

44:52.957 --> 44:56.025
Yeah, hey, em,
the tournament's today.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.394
The big tournament.

44:58.396 --> 45:00.463
Did you forget
that it's today?

45:00.465 --> 45:03.166
-The roseau bowl?
-I know, Nick, I know.

45:03.168 --> 45:05.201
Okay.

45:05.203 --> 45:06.469
I'm, uh, you know,

45:06.471 --> 45:10.106
I can have bjorn
bowl in my place.

45:10.108 --> 45:12.341
I don't--
i don't think that's such--

45:12.343 --> 45:14.077
such a really good idea, em.

45:16.280 --> 45:19.482
-I've got nothing else.
-Psych out, em.

45:19.484 --> 45:21.751
You've got you.

45:21.753 --> 45:24.721
Come on, I mean,
you're amazing at everything.

45:24.723 --> 45:27.990
And that's why I'm so thankful
for our friendship.

45:27.992 --> 45:29.759
And, I mean, I know

45:29.761 --> 45:31.894
that there's never gonna be
anything more than that,

45:31.896 --> 45:34.230
and that's totally okay.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.199
You can't help
but be into babes.

45:36.201 --> 45:38.201
So what,
you're into babes.

45:38.203 --> 45:39.736
You know,
i can't blame you,

45:39.738 --> 45:41.504
because I'm totally
into babes.

45:41.506 --> 45:44.841
Babes are literally my most
favorite thing in the world.

45:44.843 --> 45:46.409
It's, like,
why I do anything.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.077
Why do I go outside?

45:48.079 --> 45:49.879
Uh, I don't know.
Hopefully I see a babe.

45:49.881 --> 45:52.415
You know,
it's like my life's motto.

45:52.417 --> 45:54.951
-A babe a day...
-Feeds the boner buffet.

45:54.953 --> 45:56.285
I know.
I helped you write that.

45:56.287 --> 45:58.387
But what're you
trying to say?

45:58.389 --> 46:01.824
I'm trying to say
that I really just love
being your friend,

46:01.826 --> 46:04.427
and I know you can do this.

46:04.429 --> 46:07.497
Whether you're sick or not,
em, I believe in you.

46:07.499 --> 46:09.065
-That's sweet.
-Frick yeah, it's sweet.

46:09.067 --> 46:11.033
I'm a frickin' sweet guy.

46:11.035 --> 46:13.903
You know, hey,
you remember your most
viewed vlog, right?

46:13.905 --> 46:15.772
Oh, jeez,
yeah, of course.

46:15.774 --> 46:17.974
Yeah, well, you were sick
when you were doing that, too.

46:17.976 --> 46:19.976
Yeah, okay, but, you know,
how does that relate?

46:19.978 --> 46:21.978
Well, that's the episode
that you talked about

46:21.980 --> 46:23.980
the art of
the follow-through.

46:23.982 --> 46:27.517
Not just in bowling,
but in real life, too.

46:27.519 --> 46:29.919
You know, you've always known
how to get exactly what you want

46:29.921 --> 46:31.921
by just following through.

46:31.923 --> 46:34.190
That's why, what,
a million people or so

46:34.192 --> 46:36.559
have watched that episode
when like most

46:36.561 --> 46:38.895
have barely
gotten a hundred.

46:38.897 --> 46:40.530
Okay, Nick,
that's not why all those people

46:40.532 --> 46:43.499
-watched that video.
-Oh, really?

46:43.501 --> 46:46.435
Yeah, that's the episode
where my boob popped out
for nearly a minute.

46:46.437 --> 46:48.571
-That's right, 54 seconds.
-You know, I didn't even know

46:48.573 --> 46:50.373
my boob popped out until
i saw that video had over

46:50.375 --> 46:52.375
-a hundred thousand views.
-Yeah, the video got so big

46:52.377 --> 46:54.477
because know how
to follow through.

46:54.479 --> 46:56.479
I mean, it's like,
no matter how sick you get

46:56.481 --> 46:58.347
or how long your titty
hangs out of your shirt,

46:58.349 --> 47:00.216
you just keep going.

47:00.218 --> 47:01.984
You know,
you're so dedicated.

47:01.986 --> 47:05.955
Look, em, it's like,
know matter what you decide,

47:05.957 --> 47:08.457
I'm always gonna be
in your corner, all right?

47:08.459 --> 47:11.861
I appreciate it.

47:11.863 --> 47:14.831
Um, but i--
you know, I...

47:16.433 --> 47:18.534
I just don't think
i can do it.

47:18.536 --> 47:20.903
Em, I know you can do it.

47:20.905 --> 47:22.405
I hope you change your mind.

47:28.979 --> 47:30.413
All right, get outta here.

47:30.415 --> 47:31.547
Okay.

47:49.466 --> 47:51.167
Hey there, Barry.

47:51.169 --> 47:54.503
Cash drawer come out on point
three days in a row?

47:56.274 --> 47:58.541
Ah, jeez. Hello?

47:58.543 --> 48:02.478
This illness really
hit you quickly.

48:02.480 --> 48:05.448
Yeah. I, uh,

48:05.450 --> 48:08.317
I suppose it did.

48:08.319 --> 48:09.619
I guess we should
probably get going

48:09.621 --> 48:11.087
so we don't catch anything.

48:14.024 --> 48:16.325
No, you'll--

48:16.327 --> 48:17.894
you'll be fine.

48:20.030 --> 48:22.365
Ugh. I just got a call
from Nick.

48:22.367 --> 48:25.635
He says
I'm supposed to bowl
in em's place.

48:25.637 --> 48:28.037
Gosh, she's sick or something?
I don't know.

48:28.039 --> 48:30.606
Must be some kinda doofus
taking crazy pills

48:30.608 --> 48:32.909
to think I can bowl
in a tournament like that.

48:32.911 --> 48:35.111
We got people coming in
from friggin' anoka

48:35.113 --> 48:37.980
and friggin' Blaine
and friggin' coon rapids.

48:37.982 --> 48:39.382
I was just thinkin'
about my dad.

48:41.518 --> 48:43.452
Where is he now?

48:47.357 --> 48:50.192
-Dead.
-Oh.

48:50.194 --> 48:52.228
I'm so sorry.

48:56.099 --> 49:00.269
You know, Gunnar was just
pushing and pushing...

49:00.271 --> 49:02.104
And the mooning
and the farting...

49:05.275 --> 49:07.543
You know, as if I didn't
already feel bad enough

49:07.545 --> 49:09.545
about losing, you know?

49:09.547 --> 49:12.181
He had to go and make it
infinity times worse.

49:16.353 --> 49:19.422
And, uh--

49:19.424 --> 49:21.290
and, uh,
my dad stepped in.

49:24.728 --> 49:27.430
But, uh,

49:27.432 --> 49:30.266
I think he musta got
overheated or something...

49:33.003 --> 49:35.972
And, uh--

49:35.974 --> 49:38.074
you know, in his heart
because...

49:42.579 --> 49:44.347
He had a heart attack.

49:47.584 --> 49:48.718
And he...

49:51.655 --> 49:53.622
He died.

50:02.566 --> 50:04.233
I'm sorry.

50:09.706 --> 50:13.542
He was by best friend
in the world,

50:13.544 --> 50:15.745
and it's my fault
that he died.

50:18.482 --> 50:20.649
Bro!

50:20.651 --> 50:22.118
Your bowler's
not here yet.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.586
-Yeah.
-Where's Emily?

50:23.588 --> 50:26.122
I'm talking about you.
We got bad news, bro.

50:26.124 --> 50:27.456
Well, yeah,
you're telling me.

50:27.458 --> 50:29.658
There's literally,
i don't know,

50:29.660 --> 50:31.660
tens of people here
to see the big showdown.

50:31.662 --> 50:33.262
Yeah, that's the thing.

50:33.264 --> 50:34.497
There's not gonna be
a big showdown, man.

50:34.499 --> 50:36.665
Emily's sick.

50:36.667 --> 50:38.534
No kidding?

50:38.536 --> 50:40.069
Yeah, man,
dead serious, bro.

50:40.071 --> 50:42.738
Oh, jeez.

50:42.740 --> 50:44.340
-Oh, jeez.
-Yeah. Oh, jeez, is right.

50:44.342 --> 50:46.175
I just hope she's okay.

50:46.177 --> 50:48.611
Yeah, I just hope these people
stick around long enough...

50:51.181 --> 50:53.682
For nothing.

50:53.684 --> 50:56.452
I frigging stocked concessions
plum full for this.

50:59.189 --> 51:00.489
Well, scram!

51:13.371 --> 51:15.704
Attention, everyone.

51:15.706 --> 51:17.706
Emily will not be making it
to the tournament.

51:20.078 --> 51:23.412
Look, be sure to ease
your sorrows, um,

51:23.414 --> 51:26.082
with an ice cold fountain drink
or a nice hot "pretzable",

51:26.084 --> 51:28.584
available at the, um,

51:28.586 --> 51:31.720
right over there
at the concession stand.

51:31.722 --> 51:35.091
Look, this news is sure sour,
so get something sweet,

51:35.093 --> 51:36.826
like a candy bar
or maybe some Taffy.

51:36.828 --> 51:38.461
You can also
upgrade any meal

51:38.463 --> 51:40.796
with an order of nice
hot seasoned fries.

51:45.735 --> 51:48.404
Anywho, we're gonna
go ahead and get started
with the tournament.

51:48.406 --> 51:49.872
Let's, uh,

51:49.874 --> 51:53.375
have Barry Williams here
to sing the national anthem.

52:02.820 --> 52:06.255
hey, em, I hear
you're feeling real junky.

52:06.257 --> 52:09.592
Yeah, yeah,
you know, I, uh,

52:09.594 --> 52:12.461
got a real bad sinus infection
in my lower abdomen,

52:12.463 --> 52:15.631
and, uh, it's real bad,
you know?

52:15.633 --> 52:17.633
You ain't sick, are ya?

52:17.635 --> 52:21.604
I mean, those tissues aren't
from blowing your nose.

52:30.614 --> 52:32.481
What happened to dad
wasn't your fault.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.550
-I know, but i--
-plus, let's not pretend

52:34.552 --> 52:36.552
he was exactly
the picture of health.

52:36.554 --> 52:38.521
Well, a three-time
schnitzel-eating champion
never is.

52:38.523 --> 52:41.590
No. Look, em,

52:41.592 --> 52:44.460
dad would want you to bowl.

52:44.462 --> 52:46.562
So what'd you say?

52:51.601 --> 52:53.602
And we are underway, fans.

52:53.604 --> 52:56.305
I am Alan Johnson,
owner of this beautiful
establishment,

52:56.307 --> 52:59.642
and alongside me as always,
the gorgeous vocal minority

52:59.644 --> 53:02.578
and my brother
from another mother, Johnny.

53:02.580 --> 53:04.914
Yeah, see, our dad couldn't
keep it in his pants.

53:04.916 --> 53:07.683
Looks like today's the day
there's gonna be a bowling game.

53:07.685 --> 53:09.318
Excellent color there, Johnny.

53:09.320 --> 53:10.819
Might I add, the suit
looks amazing on you,

53:10.821 --> 53:12.888
as it has the last
seven days in a row.

53:12.890 --> 53:15.257
Well, you don't make a trip
all the way to mall of America

53:15.259 --> 53:16.892
-just for cargo shorts.
-You certainly don't.

53:16.894 --> 53:18.661
Let's get down to the floor.

53:25.635 --> 53:27.403
And a perfect strike
for Gunnar.

53:27.405 --> 53:30.639
Two more of those, and he is
out of the competition.

53:30.641 --> 53:33.242
-No, that's a Turkey.
-I'm not actually doing
meat right now.

53:33.244 --> 53:35.444
-I'm kind of on a cleanse.
-Well, it's working.

53:35.446 --> 53:38.380
-You look fantastic.
-My bowels feel amazing.

53:40.350 --> 53:42.284
-Hey! Hey, Emily's here.
-What?

53:42.286 --> 53:45.387
No. No.
Can you believe Emily
showed up?

53:45.389 --> 53:48.557
Absolutely,
I'm looking right at her.

53:48.559 --> 53:51.227
-Sorry I'm late.
-A little too late really.

53:51.229 --> 53:53.362
-Ooh. Right-o.
-Shut up, Johnny.

53:53.364 --> 53:54.763
Sorry.
We already started.

53:54.765 --> 53:56.232
-I'm really not sorry.
-It's true.

53:56.234 --> 53:58.300
We actually
did start already.

53:58.302 --> 54:00.302
-Well, has everyone
bowled yet?
-Just me, toots.

54:00.304 --> 54:01.837
Strike.

54:01.839 --> 54:03.272
The rules state
that as long as

54:03.274 --> 54:05.474
no bowler has bowled
two frames,

54:05.476 --> 54:08.244
new competitors
are permitted to join
the competition

54:08.246 --> 54:09.912
with the majority vote
of all bowlers

54:09.914 --> 54:11.714
and permission
from the commissioner.

54:11.716 --> 54:13.515
-Let me see that.
-No, that's not the rule book.

54:13.517 --> 54:15.017
It's, uh, "sisterhood
of the traveling pants."

54:15.019 --> 54:18.554
-No spoilers.
-You know I've got no problem.

54:18.556 --> 54:20.723
Thirsty for a showdown?
Hurry up and quench that thirst

54:20.725 --> 54:21.991
right now with
a ice cold fountain drink

54:21.993 --> 54:24.260
available at
the concession stand.

54:24.262 --> 54:26.262
This is ridiculous!
I'm trying to have
a tournament here!

54:26.264 --> 54:27.930
The only thing
that's ridiculous
is the savings

54:27.932 --> 54:30.633
when you buy
a jumbo cheese pretzel
or nachos

54:30.635 --> 54:32.968
available right now
at the concession stand.

54:32.970 --> 54:35.337
What's the matter, Gunnar?
You look scared.

54:35.339 --> 54:37.740
I mean, I would be, too,
if I were you.

54:37.742 --> 54:41.310
-I'm not afraid of nothing.
-So you are afraid of something.

54:41.312 --> 54:43.312
No. I just said
"I'm not afraid of nothing."

54:43.314 --> 54:44.680
You just used
a double-negative,

54:44.682 --> 54:46.348
thus turning it
into a positive,

54:46.350 --> 54:48.550
which translates to
"i am scared of something."

54:48.552 --> 54:51.553
So you are scared of something.
We wanna know what it is.

54:51.555 --> 54:53.322
Yeah, you know,
he's not wrong.

54:53.324 --> 54:54.957
It's bees, isn't it?
I'm scared of bees, too.

54:54.959 --> 54:56.825
I'm not even
allergic or anything.

54:56.827 --> 54:58.994
-I just hate getting stung.
-Getting stung is the worst.

54:58.996 --> 55:01.030
Right? And the swelling
and the itching--

55:01.032 --> 55:02.731
-all right!
Get the vote already!
-You heard the man.

55:02.733 --> 55:05.067
All bowlers in favor of Emily
joining the competition

55:05.069 --> 55:07.636
-just say "aye."
-Aye.

55:07.638 --> 55:09.972
-Aye.
-No!

55:09.974 --> 55:12.675
An overwhelming majority.
Let's get started, folks.

55:12.677 --> 55:14.710
Fine, but be prepared
to be dominated.

55:14.712 --> 55:17.313
I'm not taking it
easy on nobody.

55:17.315 --> 55:19.982
So he is taking it easy
on somebody.

55:19.984 --> 55:21.850
Stay tuned
to find out whom.

55:21.852 --> 55:24.853
Shut up, Johnny.
Start speaking American.

55:24.855 --> 55:26.622
You're gonna get it, Emily!

55:34.965 --> 55:36.498
ski-u-mah!

55:55.553 --> 55:58.721
Gunnar and Emily have really
run away with it.

55:58.723 --> 56:01.423
Ninth frame,
Gunnar leads by seven pins.

56:01.425 --> 56:03.792
-Emily needs a miracle here.
-She certainly does.

56:03.794 --> 56:05.728
Either that or to pick up

56:05.730 --> 56:08.397
eight more points than Gunnar
on the next two boxes.

56:08.399 --> 56:11.100
-I believe that would
do the trick as well.
-It absolutely would.

56:11.102 --> 56:13.535
It absolutely would.
Let's get right back into it.

56:18.409 --> 56:20.909
oh! Friggin' no!

56:20.911 --> 56:23.512
-Gunnar does not
like the looks of that.
-Is it possible

56:23.514 --> 56:24.847
there was something
strategic

56:24.849 --> 56:26.815
about leaving those
two pins there?

56:26.817 --> 56:28.417
Perhaps he's planning
for a future move,

56:28.419 --> 56:29.752
and this is a setup.

56:29.754 --> 56:31.720
Anything along those lines
possible at all?

56:31.722 --> 56:33.922
-Absolutely not.
-Right-o.

56:33.924 --> 56:35.791
Here comes Emily,
her chances, although grim,

56:35.793 --> 56:38.127
not quite eliminated
from the game mathematically.

56:38.129 --> 56:39.962
I was actually
in Emily's math class.

56:39.964 --> 56:41.163
And though not quite
half a tard,

56:41.165 --> 56:43.799
certainly no
straight-a student.

56:53.043 --> 56:54.877
shoot.
Emily just barely misses

56:54.879 --> 56:56.712
-that strike.
-Mmm, perhaps

56:56.714 --> 56:59.581
if she'd taken it just
a bee's dick to the left,

56:59.583 --> 57:01.450
she would've picked up
that last pin.

57:01.452 --> 57:03.185
That would be
a higher score.

57:03.187 --> 57:05.888
Great job
with your numbers,
Johnny.

57:05.890 --> 57:07.589
Here comes Gunnar
to open up the tenth frame.

57:14.098 --> 57:16.832
-He scores!
-Like a tater tot hot dish,

57:16.834 --> 57:20.202
-that is yummy.
-Smells like victory.

57:20.204 --> 57:23.172
No, you smell bad,
and I'm being serious.

57:23.174 --> 57:25.707
Maybe I beefed.
Deal with it.

57:25.709 --> 57:27.576
Whoo!

57:27.578 --> 57:29.545
Friggin' gross.

57:36.086 --> 57:38.954
another strike.
Unbelievable.

57:38.956 --> 57:41.089
I have not seen
dance moves like that

57:41.091 --> 57:43.592
since the last time
our dad got remarried...

57:43.594 --> 57:45.160
-Again.
-That is spot on.

57:45.162 --> 57:46.862
Gunnar looks to put
the final nail in the coffin

57:56.073 --> 57:57.940
Closed out the game
with a Turkey.

57:57.942 --> 58:00.108
Emily will take
an easy second place,

58:00.110 --> 58:02.644
but it's no longer possible
for her to win game one.

58:02.646 --> 58:05.814
-Yes, she would need a miracle.
-No, she literally can't win.

58:05.816 --> 58:07.049
Exactly.

58:22.799 --> 58:25.667
I didn't know
you were gonna make it
so easy for me.

58:25.669 --> 58:28.504
Oh, yeah? Well,
I'm all warmed up now.

58:28.506 --> 58:31.773
So you're going downtown,
buster brown.

58:31.775 --> 58:34.743
Hah! You keep bowling
like a can of rotten lutefisk,

58:34.745 --> 58:36.745
the only thing
going down is you

58:36.747 --> 58:38.547
-into the trash can.
-Yeah?

58:38.549 --> 58:41.216
Well, at least I don't
smell like rotten lutefisk.

58:41.218 --> 58:43.218
You're always eatin' it,

58:43.220 --> 58:45.220
when it's rotten,
probably.

58:45.222 --> 58:48.023
Ooh, shots fired.

59:21.992 --> 59:23.992
all right,
this is it, em.

59:23.994 --> 59:25.661
I believe in ya.

59:27.196 --> 59:29.197
I don't--

59:29.199 --> 59:31.733
I don't think
i can beat him.

59:31.735 --> 59:33.001
There's nobody
on this planet

59:33.003 --> 59:35.137
I believe in
more than you,

59:35.139 --> 59:37.205
and I met
Leonard nimoy once.

59:37.207 --> 59:38.874
And if he were
to show up to this thing,

59:38.876 --> 59:41.043
I'd still
believe in you more.

59:41.045 --> 59:42.811
I mean, it'd be close,
but, uh,

59:42.813 --> 59:44.012
you'd take the cake.

59:44.014 --> 59:46.214
Leonard nimoy's dead.

59:46.216 --> 59:48.584
-What?
-Yeah.

59:48.586 --> 59:52.220
Well then,
some other star that
has what it takes

59:52.222 --> 59:54.356
to pull through
when the odds are against 'em,

59:54.358 --> 59:56.124
like, uh, Whitney Houston.

59:56.126 --> 59:58.327
What I'm tryin' to say is
you have it in ya.

59:58.329 --> 01:00:00.195
You always have.

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:02.631
And just like
miss Houston herself,

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:05.167
you will
continue to succeed
for years to come.

01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:08.003
Bobby brown
can't keep you down.

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:09.871
It's time to get some.

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:15.077
and we are back,
round two of three.

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:18.080
If Gunnar wins this one,
it's all over.

01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:30.993
fair dinkum!
That was an absolute Pearl.

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:38.900
to pick up his game before
he lets this one slip away.

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:41.903
-He is bowling
like a real dick.
-I can hear you.

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:11.099
wow. That's two in a row
for Emily.

01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:13.101
She is perfect so far.

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:15.270
Imagine what Emily's score
might be if she continues

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:17.739
this perfect streak
all the way through.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:19.775
-300
-close to what
i would assume,

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:22.077
but there's no way of
knowing for sure.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:29.451
and another strike for Emily.

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:32.821
-Halfway through,
and she's still perfect.
-It is safe to say

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:34.823
that Emily
is the Serena Williams

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:36.792
of awkward
white people sports.

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:39.227
She certainly is,
and she is phenomenal.

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:01.149
Emily's got this one
in the bag.

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:03.018
We are going
to a third, folks.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.187
Whoo! Nice!

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:07.756
I knew you could do it.
I knew you could do it.

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:09.758
You know,
I'm starting to believe in me
like you believe in me.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.059
You should.
I mean, you're amazing.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.929
-All luck, all luck.
-All luck?

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:15.397
Hah! My butt.

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:17.265
You want me to go
"Batman forever" on your ass?

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:19.401
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Make your face
look like seal?

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:21.803
-You're about to get
a kiss from a rose.
-That is not cool.

01:02:21.805 --> 01:02:23.171
Seal's skin is like that
from a disease.

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:24.806
Pretty sure
it's from a shark attack.

01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:26.475
That's where
he got his nickname "seal."

01:02:26.477 --> 01:02:29.845
-Uh, seal has lupus.
-Then how can he walk?

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:31.513
He get better doctors
than president Roosevelt?

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:35.283
-Uh, f.D.R. Had polio.
-Yeah? You have polio,

01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:38.787
and I'm a shark about to attack,
and you're nothing but a seal

01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:40.956
-without all
the killer slow jams.
-You know what?

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:43.058
-You're a friggin' idiot.
-I might be an idiot,

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.227
but at least I'm not gonna
choke in the last game.

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:48.430
You done it before,
you'll do it again.
Everybody knows it.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:51.133
Then you'll have to go away
and hide for another five years.

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:55.837
Also, I'm not an idiot.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:56.031
three frames into round three,
and Gunnar is sitting perfect.

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:57.599
Meanwhile,
Emily seems to have

01:03:57.601 --> 01:04:00.101
lost her steam from round two
with two spares

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:01.469
and failing
to close out a third.

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:10.979
How goes it, em?

01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:13.982
-It's fine. You?
-Ah, pretty good.

01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:15.483
Uh, it's a little colder
than I'd like,

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:16.952
but that Minnesota for ya.

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:19.054
Ahem.
Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.290
Is there
something you wanted?

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:23.992
Yeah, I, uh,

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:26.962
I just want to talk to you
about all this.

01:04:26.964 --> 01:04:28.897
-Yeah.
-Look.

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:30.432
You're the best bowler
I've ever seen,

01:04:30.434 --> 01:04:33.201
on and off the lanes.

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:36.037
-Thanks.
-No, I mean it, em.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.039
You can do this,
all right?

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:40.542
You just need to remember
who you're doing it for.

01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:42.544
Yeah.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.145
Okay, yeah, pops.

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:46.348
-Yeah.
-No.

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:48.049
You need to do this for you.

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.385
Your whole life,
all you do is give.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.320
You wasted your time
with Donna,

01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:55.624
and god bless her heart,
she friggin' stinks.

01:04:55.626 --> 01:04:58.460
So screw Gunnar
and screw the other bowlers.

01:04:58.462 --> 01:05:00.128
This is for you,

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:02.330
because that's what dad
would want.

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:04.499
Okay?

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:06.968
-Yeah.
-All right.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.970
Go get him.

01:05:49.012 --> 01:05:51.346
I have never seen
anything like this.

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:54.716
-She is a woman on a mission.
-Speaking of missions,

01:05:54.718 --> 01:05:56.217
if you're on the way back
from the bathroom,

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:57.485
stop at
the concession stand

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:59.521
for the new kosher
Polish corn dogs.

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:01.122
They're delicious.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.230
Gunnar seems to be feeling
the pressure.

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:12.100
He seems to have lost focus.

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:14.102
Is that a thing
that's important in bowling?
I imagine it is.

01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:16.438
It most definitely is,
Johnny, yeah.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.080
And another strike
for Emily.

01:06:25.082 --> 01:06:27.415
We are witnessing
roseau bowl history.

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:28.750
That sounds more grandiose

01:06:28.752 --> 01:06:32.053
than I assume it is
in real life.

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:39.594
-That is how you bowl!
-That is how you bowl!

01:06:39.596 --> 01:06:41.229
She's unstoppable.
A slow start,

01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:43.198
but has bowled perfect
since that third frame.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.533
Well, there's only
one little box thing left

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:48.069
and their scores
are pretty close,
is that fair to say?

01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:50.071
Yes, Johnny,
they are all tied up.

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:51.606
That sounds really close.

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:54.209
Is it ever.
Gunnar will bowl first.

01:07:18.602 --> 01:07:21.469
He does look
disappointed though.

01:07:21.471 --> 01:07:24.472
Probably wishes
he'd hit all the pins
on that last one.

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:25.807
That's my best guess anyway.

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:27.675
Nothing escapes
my brother Johnny.

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:29.377
Here comes Emily.

01:07:45.328 --> 01:07:47.662
you little beauty.

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:50.632
Check out Emily.
Hoo-hoo, wow!

01:07:50.634 --> 01:07:52.167
One down, two to go.

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:00.608
I don't believe this.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:08.516
are you having fun?

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.087
Yeah.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.290
-For dad.
-All right, you got this.

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:38.613
yeah!

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:40.548
She has done it.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:43.251
She has won
the open bracket
championship

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:46.587
and redemption
for her father,
my cousin.

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:48.389
Stop by
the concession stand
to celebrate

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:51.693
with a licorice rope
or an ice cold fountain drink.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.229
They're not on sale.
We just have plenty available.

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:57.665
And it is all over,
i hope, anyway.

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:59.200
I've got some where to be.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.571
yeah, Emily!

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:09.277
You did it.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:12.447
-Whoo! Yeah!
-Whoo!

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:15.316
You friggin' cheated!

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:17.886
You cheated.
Everybody knows that.

01:09:17.888 --> 01:09:21.788
-I won that fair and square.
-Okay, whatever, Gunnar.
Have a nice day.

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:23.691
Nine out of ten times
i catch you cheating.

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:27.228
-You're a friggin' cheater.
-Celebration subs for everyone.

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:28.595
-I love subs.
-Whoo!

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:29.863
-Whoo!
-Strike!

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:45.580
oh, jeez,
has it felt good.

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:47.314
The publicity from winning
the roseau bowl

01:09:47.317 --> 01:09:49.317
has been overwhelming.

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:52.819
I mean, I had nearly
six strangers send me
congrats flowers.

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:55.356
So, yeah, pretty nuts.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:58.726
And, oh, jeez.
It didn't stop there either,
no siree.

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:02.197
My video blog has taken off
like nobody's business.

01:10:02.199 --> 01:10:03.531
It's paying the bill now,
you know?

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:06.534
So I got to quit
my teaching job.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:08.303
And now I have
so much free time
to train Donna

01:10:08.305 --> 01:10:11.372
to win next year's
roseau bowl.

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:14.375
And bjorn
has been training me

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:17.412
to win this year's
national championship.

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:20.748
Bomb dropped.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.684
Six months, huh?

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:25.553
Seems longer behind bars.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.889
You went to jail?

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:31.726
Yeah, the night
of the tournament,
i got drunk.

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.595
I don't mean like
a couple drinks too many

01:10:33.597 --> 01:10:35.597
I shouldn't drive
my truck home drunk.

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:36.931
I mean, like,

01:10:36.933 --> 01:10:39.300
blacked out,
wake up outside

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:40.969
with a goat chained
around your leg

01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:43.972
and a toilet cake
in your shirt pocket
kinda drunk.

01:10:43.974 --> 01:10:46.507
In my case, instead of
waking up outside,

01:10:46.509 --> 01:10:48.509
I woke up
in the drunk tank.

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:51.379
And instead of a toilet cake
in my shirt pocket,

01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:53.514
I just didn't have
any pants on.

01:10:53.516 --> 01:10:56.384
And, uh, the goat?

01:10:56.386 --> 01:10:58.519
No, that happened.

01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:01.856
Anywho, I always heard
that when you're in jail

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:04.259
you gotta beat up
the biggest guy in there

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:07.495
so you don't become
a prison.

01:11:07.497 --> 01:11:10.665
I coulda sworn
she was a guy,

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:14.002
you know, coming from
a costume party or something.

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:17.872
Apparently,
that police uniform
was very real,

01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:22.043
and so was her night stick,
her pepper spray, her taser,

01:11:22.045 --> 01:11:23.845
her k-9 unit.

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:27.915
After I healed up,

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:30.585
I got five months
for assault on an officer.

01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:32.287
Which is kinda bull ,

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:34.689
because even though
i threw the first punch,

01:11:34.691 --> 01:11:36.591
it didn't even land.

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:38.726
Oh, boy, were we excited
for Emily to win.

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:41.529
And, uh, we've been keeping
pretty busy since then, too.

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:46.434
I found a bird outside,
and it was almost dead.

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:47.735
I nursed it back to health.

01:11:47.737 --> 01:11:49.604
Kept it in the house
for a week.

01:11:49.606 --> 01:11:51.439
-Yep.
-And then I let it go.

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:53.308
And that's what you gotta do.
You gotta let them fly.

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:54.909
-Yeah, yeah.
-Not gonna keep him
for a pet,

01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:56.544
but I nursed it
back to health.

01:11:56.546 --> 01:11:58.079
You did,
and then you shooed it out
with a broom.

01:11:58.081 --> 01:12:00.448
Yeah, and then I shooed.
I said, "shoo! Shoo!

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.517
-Go on now, go!"
-Didn't want to leave

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:04.886
-'cause it loved her so much.
-Yeah. See that now?

01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:06.654
-They'll bond with me.
-Absolutely.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:09.057
She used that tough love,
got herself a broom,

01:12:09.059 --> 01:12:10.491
shooed that bird
outta the house.

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:12.093
You gotta push
the bird outta the nest.

01:12:12.095 --> 01:12:13.895
-That's what they say.
-Absolutely.

01:12:13.897 --> 01:12:16.397
So we're thinking about
adopting, you know?

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:19.734
You guys were clearly
in for a pretty big treat

01:12:19.736 --> 01:12:21.336
when you got to hear me

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:26.341
sing the usa anthem
at the bowling alley.

01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:30.745
But, like, sure,
there were some freakin' jerks

01:12:30.747 --> 01:12:34.349
just like saying
stupid crap on YouTube.

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:36.351
Like, whatever.

01:12:36.353 --> 01:12:38.353
I'm just gonna
keep living fancy,

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:44.125
'cause I got some real hype
behind me from that, too.

01:12:44.127 --> 01:12:48.996
I got to sing the usa anthem
at the St. Paul saints game.

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:52.367
So would
a freakin' cheeseknob
get to do that,

01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:54.502
mister @cmchfx?

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:59.040
Probably not.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.743
Um, if you guys wanted,

01:13:01.745 --> 01:13:03.745
I could probably
get you a tape

01:13:03.747 --> 01:13:06.147
of me doing
that singing thing

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:08.683
for you to use
inside your movie.

01:13:08.685 --> 01:13:10.151
Nah, we're good.

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:15.556
On a bright note,

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.892
I became very spiritual
in prison.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:20.628
I realized that I had
a lot of anger issues

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:22.029
that I needed to work on,

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:25.166
and the word of Buddha
really spoke to me.

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:26.567
It's helping me become
a better person

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:29.003
on and off the lanes.

01:13:29.005 --> 01:13:31.706
Gunney, tater tot
hot dish is ready.

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:33.408
Come get supper.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:36.778
I told you!
I wanted lutefisk
and lefse.

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.946
How hard
can it be

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:41.482
to open up a can
of lutefisk

01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:43.651
and wrap up some
lefse?

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.757
That woman.

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:52.627
This is what I deal with.

01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:54.862
This is my life.

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:57.865
Most of my videos
are getting hundreds of
thousands of views.

01:13:57.867 --> 01:14:01.035
Some are even up
in the millions.

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:02.804
Unfortunately,
the same old video

01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:05.440
still holds
my personal record.

01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:10.878
Yeah, the booby slip clip
took off like wildfire.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.182
Okay, I want you to get
a real good look in here, okay?

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:16.818
See how I'm holding
nothing back here?

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:20.655
That is how you...

01:14:20.657 --> 01:14:22.824
Follow through with style.

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:24.892
I mean, sure like
someone might be walking by

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:26.527
and they're gonna see
and be like,

01:14:26.529 --> 01:14:28.863
"what the friggin' heck
is she doing?"

01:14:28.865 --> 01:14:31.866
And I want you to look them
in the eye and you say,

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:33.768
"I'm showing the world
what I got."

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:37.939
And what I got is a real...

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:39.173
Juicy follow-through."

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:44.679
Show the world what you got.
Don't hold nothing back.

01:14:44.681 --> 01:14:49.517
I'm Emily baardsson
and this is how I roll.

01:14:49.519 --> 01:14:51.919
Whoo. Freakin' jeez.

01:14:51.921 --> 01:14:54.856
This thing is heavy.

01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:56.524
Friggin' lip's wet.

01:15:10.873 --> 01:15:13.875
Whoo! I am bowling like
a real doofus out there today.

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:16.210
Oh, come on, sis.
You just need to tweak
things a bit.

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:19.146
I know,
I'm just doing a little
self-defecating humor.

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:21.148
Did you say
"self-defecating"?

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.150
Yeah. You know,
it's like when you're
making jokes,

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:24.952
but you're also kind of
crappin' on yourself.

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:26.754
Oh, nice.

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:31.225
I knew I needed
to be a bowler

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:32.927
when me and
my best friend chambers

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:34.562
were throwing rocks
at each other

01:15:34.564 --> 01:15:35.963
and I threw this rock

01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:37.698
and it hit him
right in the forehead.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.300
He was like really mad.

01:15:39.302 --> 01:15:41.168
So I was like
running away from him,
but he caught me

01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:43.704
and he tripped me,
like, really hard,

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:47.008
and I slammed my head into
the pavement three times.

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:49.010
And that's when I knew.

01:15:49.012 --> 01:15:51.245
I get up from that,
and I knew I needed
to be a bowler.

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:55.149
It's not terrible.
She could still
pick up a spare.

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:59.554
-Jeez Louise!
-You're a monster.

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.025
I like taking pictures of people
who have kitchen tables,

01:16:04.027 --> 01:16:05.560
but they have,
like, different chairs

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:07.228
that didn't
come with the table.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:08.996
Yeah, he finds it
real interesting.

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:11.032
Yeah, so whenever we go to
some friend's house

01:16:11.034 --> 01:16:12.800
and they have a kitchen table,

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:15.036
but it's clear those chairs
aren't matching--

01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:16.637
-where'd you get them?
-Where'd you get those?

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:19.173
What happened
to the regular chairs?

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:21.042
Did they break
and then you couldn't
get 'em fixed or something?

01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:23.044
And there's usually
a heck of a story there,

01:16:23.046 --> 01:16:25.012
and I'll write that story down
and I'll put it in the book.

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:26.280
Right now it's just like--

01:16:26.282 --> 01:16:28.149
it was an empty photo album.

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:29.717
I'm just filling up
a photo album,

01:16:29.719 --> 01:16:30.985
then I just kinda
write little notes

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:32.987
about where
the chairs came from.

01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:34.989
So it's not like
a real book or nothing.

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:37.091
How full is the photo album
at this point?

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:38.593
Six or seven tables.

01:16:38.595 --> 01:16:40.361
Six or seven tables,
a bunch of chairs.

01:16:40.363 --> 01:16:41.896
So it's getting there.

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:45.366
There's a doctor
they have on the air

01:16:45.368 --> 01:16:48.369
Saturday mornings
on am 630.

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.237
Ask him if it's normal
for people

01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:53.240
to only have sex
in the dark.

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:55.743
I don't think
he's that kind of doctor.

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:57.745
They're all
that kind of doctor.

01:16:57.747 --> 01:17:01.182
It's human nature, Jeff.

01:17:01.184 --> 01:17:03.384
I have needs, you know?

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:05.119
You need to have
the lights on?

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:10.291
Why don't you stop over
at the concession stand,

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:12.293
get a licorice rope,
corn dogs,

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:14.295
or an ice cold fountain drink.
We've got the pretzels,

01:17:14.297 --> 01:17:16.664
open-face sandwiches,
and personal pizzas.

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:18.265
Feel free to grab
whatever you like.

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:19.867
We really
stocked up this year.

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:21.268
They are not on sale
or free,

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:23.037
we just have
plenty available.

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:27.775
Fair dinkum!
That was an absolute Pearl.

01:17:27.777 --> 01:17:29.777
That was a rip snorter.

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:33.347
That was absolutely bonzo.
That was a belter.

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:37.718
You little beauty!
Check out Emily.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.988
Wow! An absolute ball tearer
from Emily.

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.659
Don't say anything
to Emily,

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:47.395
but I'd eat that Booty
like groceries.

01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:49.997
Jeez Louise,
real inappropriate,
Nicholas.

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.101
I think she heard me.

01:17:59.274 --> 01:18:00.808
-Hey, Gary.
-Hey, Gunnar.

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:02.376
I'll be bowling
for free today, right?

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:05.146
Okay, um, my name's, uh--

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:06.781
I'm bar-- I'm bar--

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:12.687
did you guys, uh,
see that?

01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:17.091
We're just, like--
we're just hanging out for
a minute or whatever.

01:18:17.093 --> 01:18:18.225
It's pretty cool.

01:18:19.305 --> 01:18:25.911
