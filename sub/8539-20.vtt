00:01.697 --> 00:02.828
[theme music]

00:13.796 --> 00:16.277
[cheering]

00:16.364 --> 00:18.061
Blow out the candles
and make a wish.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.367
Okay.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.284
Is that it?

00:23.371 --> 00:24.372
- 'Alright'.
- Okay.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.028
At last, the presents.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.768
- Okay.
- Is it a vase?

00:31.118 --> 00:35.861
Oh, wait, Jane's gonna guess.

00:35.948 --> 00:39.387
- Okay, Jane.
- Yoga mat?

00:39.474 --> 00:41.563
Correct.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.869
We talked about that
ashtanga class. I just thought..

00:43.956 --> 00:45.958
- It's great, thanks.
- You're welcome.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.960
Ten bucks says you
don't get this one.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.266
You're on. Ten bucks.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.616
- Mmm.
- Happy birthday.

00:51.703 --> 00:52.748
Cover your eyes.

00:52.835 --> 00:53.792
- Got it.
- Don't cheat.

00:53.879 --> 00:55.229
- No cheating.
- Okay.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.190
- Clear?
- Okay, Jane.

01:00.277 --> 01:04.064
Okay, Rigsby. It's a gift
certificate for a spa treatment.

01:04.151 --> 01:06.588
- Damn.
- Correct again.

01:06.675 --> 01:07.719
Bingo. Ten dollars?

01:07.806 --> 01:09.591
- Yeah, I owe you.
- Aw.

01:09.678 --> 01:12.246
Okay, two for two.
How about mine?

01:12.333 --> 01:14.596
Uh, Cho..

01:14.683 --> 01:15.988
That's sweet, thank you.

01:17.816 --> 01:20.036
- I got it.
- Okay.

01:24.780 --> 01:25.737
Okay, what is it?

01:25.824 --> 01:28.653
It's, uh...a mid to high-end

01:28.740 --> 01:32.266
bottle of...wine.

01:32.353 --> 01:33.963
'Uh, no, no, no.'

01:34.050 --> 01:35.443
Uh, champagne.

01:35.530 --> 01:36.792
Yes.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.272
Yup, there I go.

01:40.448 --> 01:41.971
- Regift?
- It's a really good bottle.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.582
- I don't drink it.
- Ah, let's have some cake.

01:44.669 --> 01:45.888
Okay.

01:45.975 --> 01:48.064
What about your gift?

01:48.151 --> 01:49.109
It's on its way.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.459
[chuckles]

01:51.546 --> 01:53.374
Typical.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.854
You really think that I would
forget your birthday present?

01:55.941 --> 01:57.465
-Van Pelt.
- It's on its way.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.075
Yeah, right.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.859
Little grumpy because
daddy didn't buy you a pony?

02:03.775 --> 02:04.994
Boss, we got a call.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.564
[male #1]
'Couple of hikers
found him this morning.'

02:09.651 --> 02:13.394
'Looks like he's been
out here a couple of days.'

02:13.481 --> 02:16.832
Gunshot to the forehead.
There's no ID.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.182
This is all we found on him.

02:19.269 --> 02:23.099
A straw tube and, uh,
I don't know, religious medal?

02:23.186 --> 02:24.405
Or a good luck charm, maybe?

02:24.492 --> 02:25.928
Didn't work too well if it was.

02:26.015 --> 02:28.017
Our victim worked in
a video game arcade

02:28.104 --> 02:29.801
in the big next town
to the north of here.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.455
How did you get that?

02:31.542 --> 02:33.196
There was a big storm here
last week, wasn't there?

02:33.283 --> 02:35.720
Yeah, a lotta rain. Four inches
of snow up in the mountains.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.592
When the river rises,
this spot must be underwater.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.550
So he must have been brought
down here from somewhere upriver

02:39.637 --> 02:41.030
and got caught in the tree.

02:41.117 --> 02:42.858
Okay, but what
about the arcade?

02:42.945 --> 02:45.643
Well, this is a token
used for video games.

02:47.123 --> 02:49.256
And this is
a Peruvian finger cuff.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.867
They give them away
as cheap prizes.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.522
Our man looks a little
old to be hanging out

02:54.609 --> 02:56.785
in a video game arcade.

02:56.872 --> 02:59.091
'Unless he's into kids.'

02:59.179 --> 03:00.136
Doesn't look the type.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.703
I bet he works in one.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.922
We find the arcade,
we find the information.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.663
What's the next
big town upriver?

03:05.750 --> 03:06.751
Sierra Vista.

03:06.838 --> 03:09.014
Okay, it's a theory.

03:09.101 --> 03:11.408
We're done. He's all yours.

03:11.495 --> 03:15.238
Uh, do I detect a slight residue
of grumpiness in your demeanor?

03:15.325 --> 03:16.674
No.

03:16.761 --> 03:19.503
I swear to you, Lisbon,
your gift is on its way.

03:19.590 --> 03:23.899
I'm not grumpy, and I don't give
a damn about your supposed gift.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.161
She's still grumpy
with me, isn't she?

03:25.248 --> 03:27.076
Hmm. Not touching that.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.817
[theme music]

03:50.360 --> 03:51.796
This is the only arcade in town.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.145
And only a couple
miles from the river.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.323
[sniffs]
Gasoline, cheese, mesquite.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.802
It's wonderful.
This is the place.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.239
Yeah, we'll see.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.341
[indistinct chattering]

04:14.428 --> 04:17.257
Oh, hey, you got
a dollar on you?

04:17.344 --> 04:19.084
I'll give it right back to you.

04:30.444 --> 04:31.401
Ah!

04:34.317 --> 04:35.275
Bingo.

04:37.755 --> 04:41.193
Well, okay. You're right.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.238
Uh..

04:45.372 --> 04:46.590
Here you go. Have fun.

04:54.468 --> 04:57.862
Wow! Wow, that's Ed Didrikson.

04:57.949 --> 05:00.125
He's been working for
me about two years.

05:00.212 --> 05:01.953
- Okay.
- What happened?

05:02.040 --> 05:04.042
Somebody killed him.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.088
Can you think of why
that would happen?

05:06.175 --> 05:08.873
No, he kept to himself mostly.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.136
No trouble. No trouble at all.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.661
An honest, reliable,
married man type guy.

05:13.748 --> 05:16.577
- Wife's name?
- Uh, don't recall.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.753
Uh, Karen, Carol,
something like that.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.581
[Teresa]
'And what was his
position here exactly?'

05:20.668 --> 05:23.671
Shift manager. He ran the till,
kept the kids in line.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.282
He was good at that.
It's a responsible position.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.936
Any money go missing lately?

05:28.023 --> 05:30.068
Nope, and I keep tabs, trust me.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.462
And why should we trust you?

05:32.549 --> 05:35.987
Uh, it-it's just a phrase,
uh, like you know.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.902
- What do I know?
- No.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.295
Uh, you don't know anything.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.993
I-I'm saying it's just
a thing to say.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.082
- Oh, it's a figure of speech.
- Uh-huh.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.388
So we shouldn't
trust you really.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.999
Yeah. No, you should.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.352
When was the last time
you saw Didrikson?

05:52.439 --> 05:54.005
Friday night when he left work.

05:54.092 --> 05:56.138
He didn't show up
for work next day.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.967
I called his home,
first there was no answer.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.404
Next day, uh, his wife was there

06:01.491 --> 06:04.364
said he was away on
a-a family emergency.

06:04.451 --> 06:05.843
Doesn't know when he'll be back.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.193
- An emergency?
- That's all she said.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.934
How was her tone?

06:10.021 --> 06:12.241
Was she calm or was she upset?

06:12.328 --> 06:14.722
Upset, I guess.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.506
We'll need the home address.

06:16.593 --> 06:17.812
Sure thing.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.468
- Now.
- Right.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.383
If you wouldn't mind.

06:26.516 --> 06:28.692
Huh. It's kinda
hard to trust the guy.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.694
Yup. You and Rigsby stay here.

06:30.781 --> 06:33.001
Talk to the kids
Didrikson kept in line.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.568
See if they have
the same take on the guy.

06:34.655 --> 06:37.179
Cho, Van Pelt, and I
are gonna go talk to the wife.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.398
Alright. We'll see you later.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.312
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.576
Teenagers. I hate
questioning teenagers.

06:42.663 --> 06:44.752
It's like talking to mud.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.144
You need some
love in your heart.

06:46.231 --> 06:48.190
Oh, is that my problem?

06:48.277 --> 06:49.713
Yeah, it is.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.236
Stay close.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.324
Great.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.456
[upbeat music]

06:58.330 --> 06:59.941
Hmm.

07:00.028 --> 07:02.204
Not bad. Not bad at all.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.901
You wanna see how
it's supposed to be done?

07:03.988 --> 07:06.164
What are you,
sex perverts or cops?

07:06.251 --> 07:07.775
See what I mean?

07:07.862 --> 07:10.342
Oh, he's a cop.
I'm just a concerned citizen.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.170
Alright. We-we got
nothing to say to you.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.911
Yeah, screw the cops.

07:15.522 --> 07:16.958
Even for a midget
villain like yourself

07:17.045 --> 07:18.916
that's an untenable
ethical position.

07:19.003 --> 07:21.745
Every modern society has
some kind of police force.

07:21.832 --> 07:23.965
It's like saying screw the
public transport system.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.666
Oh. Thank you.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.421
What did you find out?

07:45.508 --> 07:46.901
County tax collectors list.

07:46.988 --> 07:49.338
The owners as Ed
and Jenny Didrikson.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.688
Moved here two years ago
from Texas.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.473
No kids, no criminal records.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.518
Not much of anything
as far as the data goes.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.215
The only odd thing is they
paid for the house in cash

07:57.302 --> 07:58.303
no mortgage.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.479
[dog barking]

08:04.005 --> 08:05.876
[upbeat music]

08:14.015 --> 08:15.712
That's crazy.
How did you do that?

08:15.799 --> 08:19.673
Focus. Watch, as I make
this machine do my bidding.

08:28.464 --> 08:31.511
Do exactly as I tell you.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.733
You. Take over.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.827
You come with me.

08:51.661 --> 08:54.055
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.883
[upbeat music]

08:57.798 --> 09:00.452
[sighs]
So..

09:00.540 --> 09:02.454
Tell us what you know
about Ed Didrikson.

09:05.457 --> 09:07.808
- Eddie that works here?
- Mm-hmm.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.244
I mean, Eddie's a cool guy.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.854
He'll hook you up
if he knows you.

09:10.941 --> 09:14.902
- Hook you up? With what?
- Uh, weed, you know.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.730
- It's Tiny's stuff, but--
- Tiny?

09:16.817 --> 09:19.167
Yeah, he's a biker.
He rolls with the X's.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.560
It's his stuff, same price.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.387
But he doesn't mess with
people like Tiny does.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.128
Or you could borrow
money from him.

09:24.215 --> 09:26.087
I mean he charges a heavy vig
but that's alright.

09:26.174 --> 09:27.654
That's what Didrikson
calls it, a vig?

09:27.741 --> 09:29.307
Yeah, am I not
saying is right? Vig?

09:29.394 --> 09:30.700
I don't know, is he
saying it wrong?

09:30.787 --> 09:32.789
- No, no, that's right.
- Yeah, that's right.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.791
Anything else you
can tell us about?

09:34.878 --> 09:37.054
He was always talking
about respect.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.013
He won't tolerate
any kind of diss.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.711
This one time, Slow Ritchie
gave him the finger.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.800
He just reached
out and broke it.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.889
- You could hear the bone crack.
- Ouch.

09:45.976 --> 09:47.151
Ritchie's on the floor screaming

09:47.238 --> 09:48.849
and Did's just looks
at him real cold

09:48.936 --> 09:50.241
he cusses him out in
French or something

09:50.328 --> 09:51.503
and goes about his business.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.896
- In French?
- I don't know.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.986
- Something foreign.
- Interesting.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.814
Do you know he's dead?

09:57.901 --> 09:58.989
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

09:59.076 --> 10:01.035
No. What happened?

10:03.037 --> 10:04.342
Thanks for your help.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.041
You can go now.

10:18.008 --> 10:21.185
Back door's locked as well.
Feels like a deadbolt.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.405
Somebody's watching us
from the upstairs window.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.496
Jenny Didrikson?

10:27.583 --> 10:30.673
'CBI. Police.'

10:30.760 --> 10:32.762
Let us in. We'd like
to speak with you.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.204
We don't have time
to wait for a warrant.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.729
But we do have reason to
believe that somebody's

10:42.816 --> 10:45.166
life is in danger, right?

10:45.253 --> 10:47.516
[dramatic music]

11:00.660 --> 11:02.139
Mrs. Didrikson?

11:02.226 --> 11:03.967
[gun cocks]

11:04.054 --> 11:06.230
Get the hell outta my house
right now, you murdering scum.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.189
I swear to God
I'll blow you away.

11:08.276 --> 11:11.932
Mrs. Didrikson, I'm gonna
show you my badge.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.026
I got people comin'.
You better get outta here.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.723
[Teresa]
'Mrs. Didrikson, we're with'

11:20.810 --> 11:22.682
the California Bureau
of Investigation.

11:22.769 --> 11:26.033
- Put the gun down.
- California Bureau of my ass.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.166
You get the hell outta here.
I will shoot you.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.994
This is my cellphone.

11:31.081 --> 11:34.519
I'm gonna dial 911 and we will
get uniformed policemen here

11:34.606 --> 11:36.652
and they will sort
everything out.

11:36.739 --> 11:39.046
In the meantime,
we'll all relax.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.700
Screw you!

11:40.787 --> 11:42.266
I'm gonna count to ten

11:42.353 --> 11:44.486
and then I'm gonna
start shootin'.

11:44.573 --> 11:45.661
One.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.489
[cellphone ringing]
Two!

11:47.576 --> 11:49.099
- 'Lisbon'.
- Jane, get off the phone.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.361
Three!

11:50.448 --> 11:51.841
I think I know
what we have here.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.800
- Four.
- I've got a situation.

11:53.887 --> 11:55.105
Five!

11:55.192 --> 11:56.498
I think Didrikson
used to work for the mob

11:56.585 --> 11:57.717
and went into
witness protection.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.109
That's why he's out here.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.110
Eight!

12:01.895 --> 12:03.984
Freeze! Don't move!

12:04.071 --> 12:05.725
Drop your weapons!
Get down on the ground!

12:05.812 --> 12:07.639
Put your hands on your heads!

12:17.519 --> 12:19.826
Who are you people?

12:19.913 --> 12:22.089
We're with the California
Bureau of Investigation.

12:22.176 --> 12:25.570
I'm Agent Lisbon. These are
Agents Cho and Van Pelt.

12:25.657 --> 12:28.225
- We're US Marshals.
- Yeah, we can see that.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.578
Okay, fellas, stand down.

12:35.102 --> 12:36.625
Jenny?

12:36.712 --> 12:38.018
'Jenny, it's us.'

12:41.108 --> 12:44.415
Whoa. Sweetheart,
put the gun down. It's okay.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.635
Alright.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.811
Sorry, agent. I didn't mean
to scare you like that.

12:48.898 --> 12:50.726
You know, we hear
the bell, we come running.

12:50.813 --> 12:54.121
That's alright.
We weren't scared.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.558
No hard feelings, right?

12:56.645 --> 12:58.125
Come on down, Jenny.
It's alright.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.692
Alright, so why are you here?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.869
What did Eddie do now?

13:02.956 --> 13:04.958
He's dead.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.176
[gasping]

13:06.263 --> 13:08.265
Single shot to the forehead.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.658
'We found him 15 miles
down the river.'

13:09.745 --> 13:10.702
Damn.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.792
I knew this would happen.

13:12.879 --> 13:13.880
You didn't know he was missing

13:13.967 --> 13:15.577
and he was under
your protection?

13:15.664 --> 13:17.666
No, Jenny informed us
he was missing three days ago.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.973
'He's been AWOL before.
We just figured he was out'

13:20.060 --> 13:21.801
another drunk or something.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.804
You sons of bitches,
I told you they'd get him!

13:24.891 --> 13:27.241
I told you, you bastards!

13:27.328 --> 13:29.199
[sobbing]

13:29.286 --> 13:32.942
'Bastards!'

13:33.029 --> 13:34.857
Wow, what did I miss?

13:36.903 --> 13:39.209
Up until two years ago,
Ed Didrikson was Eddie Russo

13:39.296 --> 13:40.645
from Philadelphia.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.909
He ran numbers for
the Battaglia family.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.215
And loan sharking
and collections.

13:45.302 --> 13:46.695
Then he got caught with
ten kilos of cocaine.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.218
The feds flipped him.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.264
The guy actually testified
against Santino Battaglia

13:50.351 --> 13:52.048
and his family.
The old man didn't go down

13:52.135 --> 13:54.268
but two of his sons got life.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.139
Russo and his wife
moved out here

13:56.226 --> 13:59.142
under our supervision with
the Witness Relocation Program.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.796
So what do you
think happened here?

14:00.883 --> 14:03.277
- What went wrong do you think?
- Same old story I guess.

14:03.364 --> 14:04.931
You know, these people,
they can't resist contacting

14:05.018 --> 14:06.671
'somebody from back home,
from their old life.'

14:06.758 --> 14:08.891
And that person tells somebody
and eventually somebody

14:08.978 --> 14:12.112
sells him out
to Santino Battaglia.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.417
You know, it happens.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.115
Yeah. We tell them
again and again.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.073
Look, your old life is
dead. It's gone, forget it.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.032
But, uh, they don't listen.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.947
So you people are
Witness Protection?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.644
- Yeah.
- 'Right?'

14:22.731 --> 14:25.473
So that means you're
supposed to protect people?

14:25.560 --> 14:27.910
We're not bodyguards, agent.
We don't babysit these people.

14:27.997 --> 14:30.434
Consultant. She's the agent.
I'm the consultant.

14:30.521 --> 14:32.262
- Agent.
- You were saying?

14:32.349 --> 14:33.916
- Consultant?
- Mm-hmm.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.396
Okay.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.398
We physically meet with
our clients once a week.

14:37.485 --> 14:38.921
And our last scheduled
appointment

14:39.008 --> 14:40.270
with Eddie was what, the day
before he disappeared.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.924
- Right?
- Yeah.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.492
And Jenny told you he was
missing and you did nothing?

14:44.579 --> 14:46.973
What should we have done,
alerted the media?

14:47.060 --> 14:48.670
We were looking for him,
and like I said

14:48.757 --> 14:50.585
it wasn't the first time
Eddie had jumped the fence.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.152
'This isn't our fault.'

14:52.239 --> 14:54.589
Oh, did you know that
Eddie was dealing drugs?

14:54.676 --> 14:56.069
- No.
- Yeah.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.635
Selling marijuana
and pills to children.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.507
No. Where did you get that?

14:59.594 --> 15:01.770
Kid down at the arcade where
Eddie works said he was frontin'

15:01.857 --> 15:05.730
for a biker named...Tiny.

15:05.817 --> 15:08.559
- You guys have been busy, huh?
- Yeah.

15:08.646 --> 15:11.432
Just to be clear on this, you
didn't know about any criminal

15:11.519 --> 15:13.913
activities the victim
might have engaged in?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.740
Look, he was a made man,
a Mafioso.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.090
It's not like he's
gonna turn around

15:17.177 --> 15:18.221
and join the church choir--

15:18.308 --> 15:19.353
So you did know?

15:19.440 --> 15:21.268
- No, we didn't.
- No.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.531
Nor do we now actually,
and you wanna know something?

15:23.618 --> 15:27.665
This is starting to sound an
awful lot like an interrogation.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.493
Not appreciated.

15:29.580 --> 15:30.886
We have reports to write.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.759
It was very nice
to have met you.

15:40.504 --> 15:43.333
Do you prefer Gina or Jenny?

15:43.420 --> 15:47.163
Who gives a damn?
Call me what you like.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.817
Gina, then.

15:48.904 --> 15:51.124
When did you last
see your husband?

15:51.211 --> 15:52.777
It was last Friday morning.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.475
He never came home from work.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.477
He called that afternoon,
said he has some business to do

15:56.564 --> 15:59.088
and that he was
gonna be home late.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.785
That was the last time
I heard from him.

16:00.872 --> 16:03.266
What kind of business was that?

16:03.353 --> 16:05.616
I don't know. Business.
I didn't ask.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.792
You didn't ask
or you didn't want to know?

16:07.879 --> 16:09.142
Oh, I get it.

16:09.229 --> 16:10.752
He's a bad man, right?

16:10.839 --> 16:12.188
'He must have been
doing something wrong.'

16:12.275 --> 16:14.408
He's out there rapin'
and killin' people.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.627
Must've.. Must have deserved
what he got, that's it, huh?

16:16.714 --> 16:17.933
Gina.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.067
What's he gonna do
wrong in this place?

16:21.154 --> 16:22.633
Vandalize a cactus?

16:22.720 --> 16:24.722
You don't like it here?

16:24.809 --> 16:27.812
You know what the worst
part is? The food.

16:27.899 --> 16:30.206
They got no good red sauce,
no sausage, and they put

16:30.293 --> 16:31.686
pineapple on their pizza.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.733
Hmm.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.735
Do you have any idea who
might have done this?

16:37.822 --> 16:39.999
Who do you think?

16:40.086 --> 16:42.131
It was that pig,
Sonny Battaglia, and his people.

16:42.218 --> 16:46.048
They swore they would get
my husband, and now they have.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.355
My husband did the
right thing, didn't he?

16:48.442 --> 16:50.835
He did what his country
asked him to do.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.620
So why is it

16:52.707 --> 16:56.537
that they didn't take care of
us like they were supposed to?

16:56.624 --> 16:57.842
Did you or your husband
recently talk to anyone

16:57.929 --> 17:00.323
from the old days,
from your previous life?

17:00.410 --> 17:03.283
No. What, are we idiots? No.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.241
Who do you talk to?

17:06.547 --> 17:08.331
Yeah, right. Who?

17:08.418 --> 17:10.507
I talk to no one.

17:10.594 --> 17:11.682
The wind.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.251
So how would the Battaglias
have found out

17:15.338 --> 17:17.297
where you were located?

17:17.384 --> 17:19.342
It was the marshals of course.

17:19.429 --> 17:20.517
Somebody paid one of those

17:20.604 --> 17:23.216
Witsec sons of bitches
to rat us out.

17:23.303 --> 17:24.826
Gina, look at me.

17:26.349 --> 17:29.135
Whoever did this,
we will catch them.

17:29.222 --> 17:30.266
I promise.

17:32.529 --> 17:33.530
Okay.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.713
- What did you learn?
- Well, she's scared.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.194
She's of Italian descent,
she bites her nails

17:45.281 --> 17:47.762
she doesn't like
pets, or pineapple.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.329
Useful stuff.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.418
Cho, reach out to
the Organized Crime Unit.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.681
Get a line on Sonny Battaglia.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.944
Find out who's in charge
who they might hire

17:56.031 --> 17:57.989
to do something like this.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.036
You and Rigsby
go and find Tiny. Bring him in.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.994
Do we know who he rides with?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.867
Kids did say something about
him being with the X's.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.956
I know a guy in San Berdoo
has a CI with them.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.523
We'll find Tiny, no problem.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.438
[rock music]

18:14.093 --> 18:15.790
[indistinct singing]

18:31.197 --> 18:32.720
Hey, we're closed.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.243
Is one of you Tiny?

18:36.463 --> 18:38.029
Who's asking?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.988
We're with the California
Bureau of Investigation.

18:45.689 --> 18:46.647
Hey!

18:49.389 --> 18:51.521
Get outta here before I
call your parole officers.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.394
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.835
- You got me!
- Sorry.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.141
- You alright?
- Yeah.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.884
- Let's put him on the chair.
- 'Okay.'

19:13.891 --> 19:15.937
You know, we just wanted to ask
you some questions that's all.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.460
I don't like cops.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.636
Ed Didrikson was
found dead yesterday.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.725
What do you know about that?

19:21.812 --> 19:23.423
Who's Ed Didrikson?

19:23.510 --> 19:25.947
Oh, you were in business
with Ed, dealing marijuana.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.470
Mari.. What?

19:27.557 --> 19:29.559
Oh, we just wanna find
out who killed him.

19:29.646 --> 19:32.736
Help us with that, we don't care
about your other business.

19:32.823 --> 19:35.174
[sighs]

19:35.261 --> 19:37.959
Eddie was a rat.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.482
Rats get dead.

19:39.569 --> 19:42.355
Not by me. Not by me.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.661
But it happens.
Nobody likes rats.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.054
He ratted you out?

19:47.838 --> 19:49.666
Couple of weeks back

19:49.753 --> 19:52.756
Eddie and me were in
his car, doing business.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.932
We got busted by
a Sierra Vista PD.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.239
Holding ten pounds of weed.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.241
I'm in the tank two days.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.765
I go before the judge,
and it's just me.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.985
Eddie's gone,
and I mean gone.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.987
He's not even
on the docket anymore.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.815
He's off the original
arrest report.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.164
So what does that tell you?

20:09.251 --> 20:12.646
Obviously he's a narc,
or a snitch.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.691
And he's so well connected.

20:14.778 --> 20:17.303
He don't mind that I
know that's what he is.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.044
Dirty, lowdown scum.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.267
That don't mean I killed him.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.925
So Sierra Vista PD confirmed
that John Tiny Callahan

20:31.012 --> 20:33.623
'was arrested two weeks ago
on marijuana charges.'

20:33.710 --> 20:36.496
They say he was alone,
not with Ed Didrikson.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.454
'They don't know anything
about him apparently.'

20:38.541 --> 20:41.152
What about records for
the vehicle Tiny was busted in?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.720
No vehicle.
He was stopped on the street.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.809
Walking around with
10 pounds of marijuana.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.463
That's what the Sierra Vista
PD chief says, yeah.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.030
What did he sound like
when he said it?

20:49.117 --> 20:50.510
Like he was covering
for some other guy's mess.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.338
So we need to speak
to those marshals again.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.253
And I'm gonna make that call.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.167
Any word on Sonny Battaglia?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.822
After his two sons went to
prison, Sonny Battaglia retired.

20:58.909 --> 21:01.782
Left the family business to his
number two, Joseph Angelini.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.305
So Angelini would
only wanna send

21:03.392 --> 21:05.742
Eddie Russo his best wishes.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.570
It's Battaglia who
would want him dead.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.703
[Grace]
'He's out of the business.
Pushing 70.'

21:09.790 --> 21:11.400
'Plays a lot of golf
in Palm Desert.'

21:11.487 --> 21:13.750
'Some people say
he's not really retired.'

21:13.837 --> 21:15.752
That he's just playing it that
way to keep his hands clean.

21:15.839 --> 21:17.624
Palm Desert right here
in California?

21:17.711 --> 21:18.755
No.

21:18.842 --> 21:20.757
Palm Desert's not in California?

21:20.844 --> 21:23.325
No, you can't sneak off and try
and talk to Sonny Battaglia.

21:23.412 --> 21:27.068
Oh, I thought you meant Palm
Desert wasn't in California.

21:27.155 --> 21:28.765
It is in California, right?

21:35.206 --> 21:36.556
[instrumental music]

21:42.083 --> 21:44.477
Son of a.. In the trees again.

21:44.564 --> 21:45.652
Excuse me!

21:47.175 --> 21:49.090
Sonny Battaglia?

21:49.177 --> 21:50.483
Keep movin', jack.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.006
Name's Jane.

21:52.093 --> 21:54.574
Patrick Jane.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.837
I need a moment
of your time if I may.

21:56.924 --> 21:59.492
- For what?
- Speak about Eddie Russo.

22:02.233 --> 22:06.107
- You a cop?
- No.

22:06.194 --> 22:08.762
Good. You alone?

22:11.155 --> 22:12.722
Yeah.

22:12.809 --> 22:13.984
Shoot him.

22:15.464 --> 22:16.465
[gun cocks]

22:23.994 --> 22:25.474
Ooh.

22:28.085 --> 22:29.826
There's three reasons
I'm not scared.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.569
Well, okay, I'm scared

22:33.656 --> 22:36.006
but there's three reasons
I'm not terrified.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.965
Please tell.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.750
One, you don't get to be
your age, rich and unimprisoned

22:40.837 --> 22:43.362
by shooting people
willy-nilly on golf courses.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.451
Until now.

22:45.538 --> 22:49.759
- You know what consistency is?
- The hobgoblin of little minds.

22:49.846 --> 22:52.632
Right. Emerson.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.810
Okay. Reason number two.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.160
I can significantly
improve your golf game.

22:59.247 --> 23:01.902
You and a hundred
other baccalas.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.294
Reason number three.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.253
I know where
to find Eddie Russo.

23:12.782 --> 23:15.306
- How do I improve my game?
- Well, it's very simple.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.960
It's easy, you have
to think of hitting the ball

23:17.047 --> 23:18.701
more as, uh, an act of creation.

23:18.788 --> 23:22.618
What you need
is a little more flow.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.794
- Flow?
- Mm-hmm.

23:24.881 --> 23:27.231
- I changed my mind. Shoot him.
- What's your favorite song?

23:27.318 --> 23:29.016
You're the smartass,
you tell me.

23:29.103 --> 23:33.150
It's either Elvis, Sinatra,
or Italian opera.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.718
Enrico Caruso
singing "Santa Lucia."

23:35.805 --> 23:37.459
Perfect. Could you hand me
one of those sticks

23:37.546 --> 23:38.808
and we'll get started.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.114
- Sticks?
- Whatever you call 'em.

23:40.201 --> 23:43.683
Not the fat one.
Get the-the other kind.

23:43.770 --> 23:48.470
Okay. Well, that's a little fat,
but...we'll make it work.

23:48.557 --> 23:49.950
Flow.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.259
- Thanks for coming.
- What's the deal?

23:55.346 --> 23:56.696
We don't have much time.

23:56.783 --> 23:57.697
Why don't you have
a seat in my office?

23:57.784 --> 23:59.002
- It's quieter.
- Mm-hmm.

24:00.613 --> 24:03.137
- You remember Agent Cho?
- How you doing?

24:06.967 --> 24:08.664
I won't beat around the bush.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.361
Two weeks ago,
did you get Eddie Russo

24:10.449 --> 24:12.407
off the hook for a drug bust?

24:13.626 --> 24:15.105
No, we did not.

24:15.192 --> 24:17.020
Well, somebody did,
and it made his accomplice

24:17.107 --> 24:18.413
very angry at him.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.458
Why would we do that?

24:19.545 --> 24:21.329
Maybe you had a deal with Russo.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.113
He gets to deal drugs,
or what have you

24:23.200 --> 24:25.115
and you look the other way,
or maybe even help him

24:25.202 --> 24:27.857
as long as he keeps helping
the feds with their thing.

24:27.944 --> 24:31.557
Let me explain the real
world to you, Teresa.

24:31.644 --> 24:34.342
Russo's been squeezed
dry of testimony.

24:34.429 --> 24:36.170
Federal prosecutors
don't need him anymore.

24:36.257 --> 24:38.955
They don't care what happens
to him, and neither do we.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.696
He gets busted,
that's his problem.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.611
And it's less work for us.

24:42.698 --> 24:47.050
So either the local cops
were in business with Eddie

24:47.137 --> 24:49.836
or my guess,
you're just as misinformed

24:49.923 --> 24:52.752
as you are
disrespectful and dumb.

24:58.061 --> 24:59.236
Bye now.

25:01.935 --> 25:04.111
- Seems dirty, doesn't he?
- Yup.

25:04.198 --> 25:06.374
Why don't you check with IA
about him and his partner

25:06.461 --> 25:07.897
see if anything pops.

25:10.987 --> 25:13.686
Where's Jane?

25:13.773 --> 25:14.948
Don't get mad,
but I have a feeling

25:15.035 --> 25:16.210
he went down
to talk to Battaglia.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.994
Dammit.

25:18.081 --> 25:20.910
Should one of us head down
to Palm Desert just in case?

25:20.997 --> 25:22.521
He made his bed.

25:26.481 --> 25:29.658
♪ Santa Lucia ♪

25:29.745 --> 25:33.270
♪ Santa Lucia ♪♪

25:34.968 --> 25:38.624

25:38.711 --> 25:41.191

25:43.454 --> 25:47.720

25:47.807 --> 25:49.069

25:51.027 --> 25:54.291
All the hours
I spent on this course, huh.

25:54.378 --> 25:58.644
The thousands I wasted on
videotapes and coaching

25:58.731 --> 26:00.733
and blondie here,
he does it with singin'.

26:00.820 --> 26:02.343
How do you like that, huh?

26:02.430 --> 26:05.564
Uh, I'm just polishing the
talent that was already there.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.304
Yeah. Yeah.

26:07.391 --> 26:11.352
So now tell me,
my strange new friend.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.267
Where is Eddie Russo?

26:15.704 --> 26:18.011
- You didn't know?
- Know what?

26:18.098 --> 26:21.362
- Eddie Russo's dead.
- No kidding.

26:22.450 --> 26:25.540
Killed. A couple of days ago.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.150
He's in the state
morgue in Sacramento

26:27.237 --> 26:29.196
under the name of Ed Didrikson.

26:29.283 --> 26:33.026
- Who did it?
- You don't know?

26:33.113 --> 26:35.942
- Interesting.
- Who did it?

26:36.029 --> 26:37.030
I don't know.

26:41.295 --> 26:44.603
- Today is a good day.
- Oh, good.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.474
Listen, if you ever
find out who killed Eddie

26:46.561 --> 26:48.128
you call me, okay?

26:48.215 --> 26:50.347
'Cause I wanna send
whoever did it some flowers

26:50.434 --> 26:51.697
and a thank you note.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.568
Sure. Sure.
What's your number?

26:56.179 --> 26:58.442
What are you doin'?
Don't give him your number.

26:58.529 --> 27:01.184
This guy, what is he gonna do?

27:01.271 --> 27:03.883
Here. It's a clean line.
You can talk.

27:03.970 --> 27:05.580
Thank you.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.234
So if you didn't do it,
then who would've done it?

27:07.321 --> 27:09.540
Who was next in line?

27:09.628 --> 27:11.804
An angry husband, most likely.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.893
Eddie was a degenerate
skirt hound.

27:13.980 --> 27:16.678
- Is that right?
- Hmm. An animal.

27:16.765 --> 27:19.550
Compulsive. So tell me,
uh, how was it done?

27:19.638 --> 27:20.943
How did they do it to him?

27:21.030 --> 27:25.034
Oh, uh, I can assure you
he-he didn't suffer.

27:25.121 --> 27:27.602
But thanks for your time,
Mr. Battaglia. See you later.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.299
Hey, wait a minute. I'm not
finished talking with you yet.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.127
Well, I'm finished
talking with you.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.912
Hey, what-what are you,
Al Pacino all of a sudden?

27:32.999 --> 27:34.870
People don't act
that way with me.

27:34.957 --> 27:37.525
I do when
there's witnesses around.

27:37.612 --> 27:38.831
What am I gonna
do with this guy?

27:38.918 --> 27:40.397
He's got a screw loose.

27:40.484 --> 27:42.182
Oh, you think you
have a certain outlaw charm

27:42.269 --> 27:45.141
about you, and you do,
but you live by oppression.

27:45.228 --> 27:48.928
In reality, you're just
a greedy, twisted little sadist.

27:49.015 --> 27:50.843
Hey, screw you, blondie.

27:50.930 --> 27:53.933
You're lucky you helped me
beat Arnold Palmer here, huh

27:54.020 --> 27:56.631
'or I'd plug you right now.
The hell with the witnesses.'

27:58.764 --> 28:00.243
[Wayne]
'Screw you.'

28:01.810 --> 28:05.031
You played golf
with Sonny Battaglia?

28:05.118 --> 28:09.818
Yeah. Sonny, uh..
Well, I did. Mm-hmm.

28:09.905 --> 28:12.516
- And what'd you learn?
- He didn't kill Russo.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.215
- And golf is oddly very easy.
- And you're sure of this?

28:15.302 --> 28:17.826
Hmm. I'm very sure.
It's all about rhythm.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.786
Anyone could do it. Yeah,
uh, Sonny Battaglia's clean.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.744
At least I'd think. It's hard
to say with a sociopath.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.398
That doesn't mean
that some other Mafioso

28:24.485 --> 28:25.791
didn't do it of course.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.662
Sonny thinks it was an ex-lover.

28:27.749 --> 28:28.924
Yeah, the key is who sprung
Eddie from that charge

28:29.011 --> 28:30.360
and I'm betting
it's those marshals.

28:30.447 --> 28:31.753
'Which means we're
gonna have to accuse'

28:31.840 --> 28:33.102
the Sierra Vista PD
of double-dealing.

28:33.189 --> 28:34.756
Hmm. That should be fun.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.845
A vehicle registered to
Ed Didrikson just entered

28:36.932 --> 28:38.368
the system, it was
towed from the lot

28:38.455 --> 28:40.240
outside House of Games
Monday morning.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.851
Sierra Vista PD couldn't find
their ass in the dark.

28:42.938 --> 28:44.723
So if Russo's car
was still parked outside

28:44.810 --> 28:46.725
the House of Games that means
somebody must've picked him up.

28:46.812 --> 28:47.987
Maybe the arcade
security cameras

28:48.074 --> 28:49.466
have a picture of who it was.

28:49.553 --> 28:53.209
- Why don't you two find out?
- Right.

28:53.296 --> 28:56.952
Yeah, you guys go find out.
I'll find the couch.

28:57.039 --> 28:58.562
Oh, there it is.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.434
We need to look
at your security tapes.

29:00.521 --> 29:02.828
Tapes? I have no tapes.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.481
You have cameras.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.353
Of course. But only
the little red light works.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.355
That's all you need.

29:08.442 --> 29:11.184
What are you guys looking for
anyhow? Nothing happened here.

29:11.271 --> 29:12.838
We wanna know
who picked up Russo.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.535
I could tell you that.
His wife picked him up.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.058
I-I saw her in the parking lot.

29:16.145 --> 29:17.364
- His wife?
- Yeah.

29:17.451 --> 29:19.148
- Are you sure it was her?
- Sure.

29:19.235 --> 29:20.933
I-I mean, I assume it was her.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.631
She-she's picked him up
a couple times before.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.981
- Brunette, slim, maybe 5'4"?
- No.

29:26.068 --> 29:28.767
A pretty black lady,
about 5'10".

29:33.119 --> 29:34.816
Boss, we're gonna need
to speak to Marshal Knox

29:34.903 --> 29:36.862
about a few things. Mm-hmm.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.388
Hey!

29:41.475 --> 29:43.129
What do you people
think you're playing at?

29:43.216 --> 29:45.218
- Who's your supervisor?
- Oh, uh..

29:45.305 --> 29:47.698
- I want some answers right now.
- Uh, Lisbon!

29:47.786 --> 29:50.092
I'm gonna make sure you regret
that you ever screwed with me.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.225
- I'm not even a cop.
- 'Hello, Marshal Exley.'

29:52.312 --> 29:54.227
I just got a call from
my supervisor telling me

29:54.314 --> 29:57.186
that you put in an official
request to question Marshal Knox

29:57.273 --> 29:59.188
as a person of interest
in the Russo case.

29:59.275 --> 30:01.669
- Yes.
- It's all over the department.

30:01.756 --> 30:03.366
Why are you
trying to ruin her?

30:03.453 --> 30:05.499
Did you know that she was
with Russo on Friday night

30:05.586 --> 30:06.935
'the night he vanished?'

30:07.022 --> 30:08.241
So you're saying that
she fingered him?

30:08.328 --> 30:09.546
That she set him up for the mob?

30:09.633 --> 30:11.244
Well, it certainly
looks that way.

30:11.331 --> 30:14.203
No, that's garbage!
It's absurd. I would've known.

30:14.290 --> 30:15.639
Just saying.

30:15.726 --> 30:16.989
She's my partner
for God's sake.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.904
I would know
if she wasn't straight.

30:18.991 --> 30:21.515
We confirmed with
the Sierra Vista PD.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.560
The night that Russo got
arrested, Knox came in

30:23.647 --> 30:26.041
and had them drop the charges
as if she was doing it

30:26.128 --> 30:28.087
on behalf of
the Marshals Service.

30:28.174 --> 30:29.566
Why would she do that?

30:29.653 --> 30:30.959
Well, there's no use
in fingering Russo

30:31.046 --> 30:32.831
if he's locked up
safe in prison.

30:36.051 --> 30:39.446
No, this is a mistake.
There's some explanation.

30:39.533 --> 30:42.928
Then why can't we find her
to hear her say that?

30:43.015 --> 30:44.886
I don't know.

30:44.973 --> 30:47.019
Do you know where she is now?

30:47.106 --> 30:48.150
No.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.545
Alright then.

30:55.114 --> 30:56.680
[siren wailing]

31:00.641 --> 31:02.121
[indistinct radio chatter]

31:14.437 --> 31:15.525
Ma'am?

31:17.484 --> 31:19.051
Hello.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.016
She's hardly breathing.
You better call it in.

31:28.103 --> 31:30.758
2 Alpha 44, I need fire
and rescue to roll Code 3

31:30.845 --> 31:32.978
'to the 500 block of Lexington.'

31:33.065 --> 31:34.501
'Attempt suicide.'

31:39.332 --> 31:41.116
Got it. Thanks.

31:42.596 --> 31:43.902
'She's at County General.'

31:43.989 --> 31:45.033
'They're pumping
her stomach now.'

31:45.120 --> 31:46.513
Is she gonna be okay?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.515
They don't know
what she took or how much

31:48.602 --> 31:51.344
so it's early to tell but looks
like she's gonna make it.

31:51.431 --> 31:52.693
Okay.

31:54.564 --> 31:56.479
I'm gonna go see her.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.873
- Wait. We'll come with.
- No, that's alright.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.614
I-I can handle this.

32:00.701 --> 32:03.182
I respect your distress,
she's your partner.

32:03.269 --> 32:06.359
But please understand
our situation here.

32:06.446 --> 32:07.708
'We've got a case
to run, and she's still'

32:07.795 --> 32:09.536
a person of interest.

32:09.623 --> 32:12.539
- 'We need to speak to her.'
- Okay. I understand.

32:12.626 --> 32:15.977
- You got a job to do.
- Oh, here's a thought.

32:16.064 --> 32:18.849
- What if you did it?
- Me? What?

32:18.937 --> 32:21.113
Sure. Knox wasn't setting up
Russo with the mob.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.462
'She was meeting him that night'

32:22.549 --> 32:24.116
because they were
having an affair.

32:24.203 --> 32:25.726
Yeah. That makes sense.

32:25.813 --> 32:27.554
- It does, doesn't it?
- You're outta your mind!

32:27.641 --> 32:29.773
That low life crook
in bed with your Christy.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.079
'And don't try to tell us'

32:31.166 --> 32:32.385
'you don't have
a secret crush on her.'

32:32.472 --> 32:35.997
- That's crap, pal!
- Uh, you see the anger?

32:36.084 --> 32:37.259
'The sort of scandal
that could screw up'

32:37.346 --> 32:38.739
'your career
along with hers.'

32:38.826 --> 32:40.436
I mean, I understand,
any man in your position

32:40.523 --> 32:42.047
would wanna kill him.

32:44.223 --> 32:45.615
That's enough.

32:45.702 --> 32:47.487
Oh, I'm not saying
that you knew about the affair.

32:47.574 --> 32:51.230
I'm just sayin' that if you did,
you'd be our prime suspect.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.014
It's funny, really,
your best defense

32:53.101 --> 32:56.800
is your apparent lack of the
most basic detective skills.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.977
Oh, you little son of a bitch.

32:59.064 --> 33:02.023
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm just
thinkin' out loud. No offense.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.590
Yeah, right.
No offense.

33:03.677 --> 33:04.983
None taken.

33:09.813 --> 33:12.033
Well, you certainly pushed
his buttons, didn't you?

33:12.120 --> 33:13.948
Eh.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.428
Cho, come to
the hospital with me.

33:15.515 --> 33:16.951
You two talk to Gina Russo.

33:17.038 --> 33:19.127
'Find out what she
thinks about all of this.'

33:22.000 --> 33:24.611
- Try and behave yourself.
- I'll do my best.

33:26.352 --> 33:29.703
- Can I see your phone?
- Do you think he did it? Exley?

33:29.790 --> 33:31.879
I don't know.
Do you think he did it?

33:31.966 --> 33:34.490
Well, if there was an affair,
he had motive like you said.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.188
Yeah, if.

33:36.275 --> 33:38.320
And he didn't respond
well to being prodded.

33:38.407 --> 33:39.974
- Nobody does.
- 'Hmm.'

33:40.061 --> 33:41.541
When someone answers can
you say, is Mary there?

33:41.628 --> 33:43.021
- Why?
- Just for fun.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.067
[cellphone ringing]
Santa Lucia!

33:51.681 --> 33:54.467
- Huh?
- Hi. Is, um, is Mary there?

33:54.554 --> 33:56.208
No, lady.
It's the wrong number.

33:57.470 --> 33:58.862
Wrong number.
What was that about?

33:58.949 --> 34:02.431
Groundwork. Could I have
a look at your phone?

34:02.518 --> 34:05.173
Here. Hold these.

34:05.260 --> 34:06.479
Try them on.

34:08.742 --> 34:10.483
Wow, they look good.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.485
Do you have, uh,
whatchamacallit, uh

34:12.572 --> 34:14.835
warm-up gear, training sweats,
the shiny type?

34:14.922 --> 34:17.098
No. Yep. Where are
you going with this?

34:17.185 --> 34:19.753
- Ask to speak to Mary.
- Oh, I don't like this.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.363
Hi, can I speak to Mary please?

34:21.450 --> 34:22.451
No.

34:23.670 --> 34:24.671
- What did he say?
- No.

34:24.758 --> 34:26.151
[laughing]
Who was that?

34:26.238 --> 34:27.891
It's just an old friend.
Where's your sweat gear?

34:27.978 --> 34:30.329
- Uh, in my locker.
- Alright, let's go.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.549
Jane?

34:38.989 --> 34:40.121
[instrumental music]

34:50.610 --> 34:52.177
- Here we go.
- Okay.

34:52.264 --> 34:54.701
But I'd feel better
if Lisbon knew about this.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.659
Then tell her.

34:56.746 --> 34:58.531
- You know what to do, right?
- Mm-hmm.

34:58.618 --> 35:00.750
Just stay for a few minutes
until she gets comfortable

35:00.837 --> 35:03.101
and then when
Rigsby calls, you leave.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.754
- What's my reason for leaving?
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

35:04.841 --> 35:08.236
Something to do
with work. Just be vague.

35:08.323 --> 35:09.716
But Rigsby's right, you know.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.631
Lisbon told us
to go see Gina Russo.

35:11.718 --> 35:13.589
She told you to stay
out of trouble.

35:13.676 --> 35:15.156
Sonny, hi. Patrick Jane.

35:15.243 --> 35:18.986
Oh, yeah. You. Okay.

35:19.073 --> 35:21.989
- You got a name for me?
- No, not yet. Maybe soon.

35:22.076 --> 35:23.599
Never mind about that.

35:23.686 --> 35:26.385
Mary wants to know, has anyone
left any messages for her?

35:26.472 --> 35:29.127
Are you crazy?
Listen, you little jerk.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.911
I will tear
your freaking head off

35:30.998 --> 35:32.565
'and stick it
where the sun don't..'

35:34.784 --> 35:35.916
You gotta talk
to the marshals for me.

35:36.003 --> 35:38.048
I wanna know when
I'm gonna get moved.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.877
Uh, that's not really
our purview but--

35:40.964 --> 35:42.836
Thank you. I'd appreciate it.

35:45.926 --> 35:47.884
What's he doin'?

35:47.971 --> 35:50.409
Oh, uh, you said you
can't get any good food out here

35:50.496 --> 35:53.934
so, uh, I thought
I'd come by and cook you some.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.370
Huh.

35:55.457 --> 35:59.200
If you wanna help,
you can chop these.

35:59.287 --> 36:00.462
Okay.

36:02.899 --> 36:03.944
[instrumental music]

36:10.994 --> 36:11.952
Do you have an apron?

36:14.433 --> 36:16.522
'I can't imagine being
stuck out here in the desert'

36:16.609 --> 36:20.221
'alone with the coyotes
and the tumbleweeds'

36:20.308 --> 36:22.658
and the bad red sauce.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.791
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:24.878 --> 36:27.576
Out here, you're all alone.

36:27.663 --> 36:29.535
When you said you were homesick,
Eddie probably told you

36:29.622 --> 36:31.972
to make friends, join a gym
or something, right?

36:32.059 --> 36:35.932
- Yoga, he says.
- Uh, yoga.

36:36.019 --> 36:37.847
'Cause standing on your head,
listening to flute music

36:37.934 --> 36:39.153
is definitely the answer.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.415
[cellphone ringing]

36:44.071 --> 36:47.814
Yeah. Okay.
Got it.

36:47.901 --> 36:50.904
I've gotta go
do something. Work.

36:50.991 --> 36:53.254
Oh, well, come back quick.
We'll still be here.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.691
'Alright. Bye.'

36:55.778 --> 36:57.519
Mmm. Mmm.

36:59.173 --> 37:03.395
- Well, that was good.
- Hmm. Not bad at all.

37:03.482 --> 37:05.005
- Salut.
- Salut.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.102
Gina, we believe
that Eddie was having

37:15.189 --> 37:17.278
a romantic relationship
with Christy Knox

37:17.365 --> 37:20.281
from the WitSec Program.

37:20.368 --> 37:23.110
Romantic? With the marshal lady?

37:24.459 --> 37:26.331
Are you kidding? No.
Never happened. No.

37:26.418 --> 37:29.247
Why are you so sure?
Eddie liked the ladies, right?

37:29.334 --> 37:32.250
Didn't he? Womanizer.
Famous for it.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.295
Yeah, maybe in his old life
but he changed.

37:34.382 --> 37:36.515
Changed? Really?

37:36.602 --> 37:37.777
You believe that people
can change who they are?

37:37.864 --> 37:39.431
Yeah. Sure.

37:39.518 --> 37:42.999
- People can change.
- Eddie couldn't change. No.

37:43.086 --> 37:47.961
He used to be somebody.
Now, he's gotta be nobody. No.

37:48.048 --> 37:50.268
Even after he dragged you
all the way out here

37:50.355 --> 37:51.834
to the middle of nowhere,
there's still some nights

37:51.921 --> 37:53.836
he doesn't come home.

37:53.923 --> 37:56.839
Just like before.

37:56.926 --> 37:59.364
Before you can move on, Gina

37:59.451 --> 38:01.496
you're gonna make
things right now.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.934
- Tell me the truth.
- I'm not sayin' nothin'.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.676
You found out he was cheating,
you snapped, and you shot him.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.809
You can say whatever you like.
It means nothing.

38:09.896 --> 38:12.594
- You have to prove it.
- Where did you do it?

38:12.681 --> 38:15.380
What happened to the gun
that you used?

38:15.467 --> 38:17.730
You want some coffee?

38:17.817 --> 38:20.515
- Dessert?
- No, thanks.

38:22.909 --> 38:24.737
The reason I'm here
alone, my colleagues

38:24.824 --> 38:27.609
are kind of straight arrows.

38:27.696 --> 38:29.176
I don't want 'em
getting mixed up in anything

38:29.263 --> 38:30.743
you know, sketchy.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.920
What's sketchy?

38:34.007 --> 38:36.836
I went to talk
to Sonny Battaglia.

38:36.923 --> 38:38.577
- Oh?
- Impressive man.

38:38.664 --> 38:40.143
Knows how to get what he wants.

38:41.797 --> 38:44.365
- He's a vicious scumbag.
- Yeah, he is.

38:44.452 --> 38:47.673
Didn't speak too well
of you either.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.718
He seems to think it was
you that encouraged Eddie

38:49.805 --> 38:51.416
to rat in the first place.

38:51.503 --> 38:54.244
- That's not true.
- That's what he thinks.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.986
And you know what he's like once
he gets that idea in his head.

38:57.073 --> 39:00.903
Stubborn. He offered me
a very sweet deal.

39:01.774 --> 39:03.253
What kind of a deal?

39:03.341 --> 39:04.472
What kind of deal do you think?

39:04.559 --> 39:06.256
You tell me.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.171
You could either make me
look good with the cops

39:08.258 --> 39:10.826
and confess to what you've done

39:10.913 --> 39:14.526
or you can make me look good
with Sonny Battaglia..

39:14.613 --> 39:16.528
...and die.

39:16.615 --> 39:18.007
That's your choice.

39:21.097 --> 39:24.362
Die? You're a cop.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.799
And cops never bend
the law, do they?

39:28.453 --> 39:31.543
Besides I'm not even
really a cop.

39:31.630 --> 39:34.763
I'm just a consultant.

39:34.850 --> 39:38.158
Looking out for number one.

39:38.245 --> 39:40.116
Better make up your mind.

39:40.203 --> 39:43.772
- Battaglia's man is on his way.
- I don't believe you.

39:43.859 --> 39:46.601
Well, I'll call Sonny
and have him tell you himself.

39:46.688 --> 39:50.213
You remember
his voice, don't you?

39:50.300 --> 39:52.607
Don't you?

39:52.694 --> 39:54.087
- 'Yeah.'
- Hey, Sonny.

39:54.174 --> 39:55.741
- 'You again?'
- Yeah, it's me again.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.133
'This better be
what I wanna hear.'

39:57.220 --> 39:58.352
You remember that woman
we were talking about?

39:58.439 --> 39:59.875
Well, she's right here.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.747
Listen you piece of dirt.
You dog turd.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.183
- Yeah, sure.
- 'When I get my hands..'

40:03.270 --> 40:04.576
I'll put her on.

40:10.190 --> 40:11.278
Hello.

40:11.365 --> 40:13.019
'You are dead. Do you hear me?'

40:13.106 --> 40:15.891
I am gonna rip off your head
and chew on your spine!

40:15.978 --> 40:17.850
'Nobody screws around
with me and lives!'

40:17.937 --> 40:18.981
'You hear me?'

40:20.418 --> 40:22.724
So, what's it gonna be, Gina?

40:22.811 --> 40:26.467
Confess or die?

40:26.554 --> 40:30.297
- You can't do this.
- Oh, I'm doin' it.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.342
Oh, he's here.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.083
Faster than I thought.

40:46.400 --> 40:49.316
There's no guns in the house,
the police have taken 'em all.

40:49.403 --> 40:52.711
It's either him or me, Gina.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.800
Alright. Alright.

40:54.887 --> 40:56.497
I did it, okay?
I killed Eddie.

40:56.584 --> 40:59.326
- Good. Tell me the details.
- You tell him to stop!

40:59.413 --> 41:02.503
- Stop him!
- Details.

41:02.590 --> 41:06.594
I followed them from work
Friday night, alright?

41:06.681 --> 41:08.335
'I watched them go to a motel.'

41:08.422 --> 41:09.858
Afterwards, she drove him
back to his car

41:09.945 --> 41:12.208
there was no one around.

41:12.295 --> 41:13.862
I shot him.

41:13.949 --> 41:15.473
And then.. And then I drove
his body to a bridge

41:15.560 --> 41:17.213
and I dumped it over the edge.

41:17.300 --> 41:18.476
Perfect.
Thank you.

41:18.563 --> 41:20.347
Agent Rigsby, arrest this woman.

41:23.655 --> 41:25.526
Put your hands behind your back.

41:32.707 --> 41:35.754
Looking good, sport.
Looking good.

41:37.973 --> 41:39.975
Knox wanted to apologize
to you personally

41:40.062 --> 41:42.238
but she-she's still
in the hospital.

41:42.325 --> 41:43.718
What is she gonna do now?

41:43.805 --> 41:46.199
Well, she's out of
the Marshals Service of course.

41:46.286 --> 41:50.508
Um, she's gonna take
some time off, see what's next.

41:50.595 --> 41:54.729
And, um...I wanna apologize too.

41:54.816 --> 41:59.821
I got turned around,
and, uh...I was out of line.

41:59.908 --> 42:01.780
And congratulations
on solving the case.

42:01.867 --> 42:04.260
Oh, come here.
Give me a hug.

42:04.347 --> 42:05.740
- Come on. There we go.
- Okay.

42:05.827 --> 42:08.047
- You're a good man.
- Alright.

42:08.134 --> 42:09.918
Okay. Okay.

42:10.005 --> 42:12.486
Um..

42:12.573 --> 42:14.357
That's not how we do things
in the Marshals office

42:14.444 --> 42:17.447
but, uh, I guess it works.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.014
You two be well.

42:21.190 --> 42:23.932
What were you thinking
by the way? Unbelievable.

42:25.586 --> 42:27.457
Believe, Lisbon. Believe.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.460
You gotta look at it this way.
We've closed yet another case.

42:30.548 --> 42:33.986
Toying with mafia bosses is no
way to close cases. It's stupid.

42:34.073 --> 42:36.423
Meh. You're just trying
to find fault, and I know why.

42:36.510 --> 42:37.555
Oh, really.

42:37.642 --> 42:38.904
Yeah, you're still
a little grumpy

42:38.991 --> 42:40.558
about the birthday present
thing, aren't you?

42:40.645 --> 42:42.821
- Will you leave that alone?
- Oh, unbelievable.

42:42.908 --> 42:45.171
You know, you've got
no reason to be grumpy anymore.
