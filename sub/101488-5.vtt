WEBVTT

00:19.894 --> 00:22.647
Get ready for the time capsule

00:22.731 --> 00:26.067
that was buried at Wagstaff 50 years ago.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.777
Thank you, Mr. Branca, for digging it up.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.821
Not my job... but it's okay.

00:29.904 --> 00:33.575
Oh, I thought there was a guy
buried there named Tim Capsule.

00:33.658 --> 00:34.868
Let's crack it open.

00:34.951 --> 00:37.620
And lending a hand
will be student volunteer, Tina.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.039
Thanks, Mr. Frond.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.458
You might say we have
some <i>history </i>between us.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.626
-Heh. Um, um, uh...
-What? Okay, okay.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.712
-(stammering)
-Can we just do this before
it starts raining, please?

00:47.005 --> 00:47.922
Quite an odor.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.341
It smells like ass!

00:49.424 --> 00:50.592
Trying not to breathe too much.

00:50.675 --> 00:51.968
Here's a cootie catcher.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.596
Imagine the ancient cooties
it may still contain.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.014
Wagstaff yearbook.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.390
Not super diverse.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.641
Tina's killing it up there.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.769
And by "it," I mean "my interest."

01:00.852 --> 01:02.645
Shh, Gene, the station's
doing another contest

01:02.729 --> 01:04.230
for free Boyz 4 Now tickets.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.316
Which I want to win... as a joke.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.860
Classic "winning incredibly
valuable tickets as a joke."

01:08.943 --> 01:10.320
Never gets old.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.322
Yeah, wouldn't it be hilarious if I won?

01:12.405 --> 01:15.325
Me sitting randomly in the front row
five seats from Boo Boo,

01:15.408 --> 01:17.827
this person who doesn't even care--
take that!

01:17.911 --> 01:19.496
Me! Boo Boo! Five feet!

01:19.579 --> 01:21.664
Okay, I get it-- let go of my arm!

01:21.748 --> 01:23.792
And this, I believe, is a stuffed animal?

01:23.875 --> 01:25.960
-That is a dead mole.
-Okeydokey.

01:26.044 --> 01:26.961
Cute, though.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.254
FROND:
Hold on. Louise Belcher?

01:28.338 --> 01:29.673
Are you listening to a radio?

01:29.756 --> 01:30.882
I'm trying

01:30.965 --> 01:32.175
to find local news coverage

01:32.258 --> 01:33.968
of this historic time capsule opening.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.137
Did you not alert the media, Mr. Frond?

01:36.221 --> 01:38.181
No. Was I supposed to?

01:38.264 --> 01:39.224
LOUISE: Obviously.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.600
(sighs) Maybe they're on it.

01:40.684 --> 01:41.768
I'll keep listening.

01:41.851 --> 01:42.977
Uh, right. Thank you.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.604
Uh-huh. Oh, my God!
They're giving tickets

01:44.688 --> 01:46.064
right now to the 17th caller.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.440
Isn't that the emergency cell phone

01:47.524 --> 01:48.858
we're only supposed to use for emergen...

01:48.942 --> 01:50.068
For being the 17th caller? Yeah.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.319
-(line ringing)
-They're answering!

01:51.403 --> 01:52.946
<i>RADIO DJ:</i>
<i>Congratulations, caller...</i>

01:53.029 --> 01:54.030
Oh, my God!

01:54.114 --> 01:55.281
<i>-...twelve.</i>
-(groans)

01:55.365 --> 01:56.950
(muttering):
Psychopath.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.201
Oh, here's a note.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.786
Looks like bugs read it first.
(chuckles)

01:59.869 --> 02:01.454
"Dear future students of Wagstaff..."

02:01.538 --> 02:02.872
And it's gone.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.375
Well, a powerful message just the same.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.545
So I just missed out on
Boyz 4 Now tickets for us, Tina.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.171
(scoffs)
Dodged a bullet, huh?

02:10.255 --> 02:12.590
-Whew! (groans)
-Darn, it's sold out, too.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.592
And I hear since they're
only playing intimate venues

02:14.676 --> 02:16.761
like the Wharf Arts Center,
that Boo Boo guarantees

02:16.845 --> 02:18.930
he'll make eye contact with
every girl in the audience.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.807
Gah!
Why would I even care about that, Tina?!

02:20.890 --> 02:22.392
I wouldn't! Care!

02:22.475 --> 02:24.185
Why is it always my arm's fault?!

02:24.269 --> 02:26.813
Oh, Tina. So, I guess the way
this whole time capsule thing

02:26.896 --> 02:28.732
works is now <i>we </i>have to do one.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.692
-You mean we <i>get </i>to do one.
-Sure.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.235
And since you've shown an interest,

02:32.318 --> 02:34.362
how'd you like to coordinate it?

02:34.446 --> 02:35.864
So I don't have to.

02:35.947 --> 02:36.990
Me? Really?

02:37.073 --> 02:39.409
Yeah, get some submissions
from students...

02:39.492 --> 02:41.327
Decide what best represents Wagstaff?

02:41.411 --> 02:43.038
Who lives, who dies,
who tells their story?

02:43.121 --> 02:44.456
Kind of regretting this now.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.124
Have complete control,
so it can be done right,

02:46.207 --> 02:47.709
unlike those slackers 50 years ago?

02:47.792 --> 02:48.960
No offense.
Were you one of them?

02:49.044 --> 02:50.503
No. How old do you think I am?

02:50.587 --> 02:52.630
-A lot.
-How old is Dumbledore?

02:52.714 --> 02:53.798
Wow.

02:53.882 --> 02:54.883
ALL:
Ooh!

02:54.966 --> 02:57.260
I understand the past now, Old Tina.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.762
And no dead moles.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.722
Tina, choosing you for this

03:00.805 --> 03:02.640
was the greatest decision of my life.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.809
Mr. Frond, you're still alive!

03:04.893 --> 03:07.062
I was just waiting for this day.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.855
Bye.

03:08.938 --> 03:10.398
I won't let you down, Mr. Frond.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.858
Good. I mean, how could you?

03:11.941 --> 03:13.818
It's putting crap in a box.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.945
TINA:
So what am I looking at here, Peter?

03:16.029 --> 03:19.824
It's a diorama of a classroom
of kids making dioramas.

03:19.908 --> 03:20.909
Got to give this a maybe.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.577
See if any good stuff comes along.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.371
I worked really hard on it.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.039
Don't take this the wrong way,
Peter, but maybe save

03:26.122 --> 03:28.166
the diorama for your mama?
Next.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.126
It's a poem-- it's about kickball,

03:30.210 --> 03:32.337
but it's not <i>really </i>about kickball.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.838
Yeah, here's the deal, Rudy.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.007
-My name's on this thing...
-It is?

03:36.091 --> 03:37.926
Not literally, but maybe it can be?

03:38.009 --> 03:39.302
So, yeah, what goes in the capsule

03:39.386 --> 03:40.720
has to be really, really special.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.013
My dad cried when he read it.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.932
I'm gonna slide it down
to the maybe pile, Rudy.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.393
Oh, wow, that's an awful lot
in the maybe pile.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.520
It's gum, so future people

03:48.603 --> 03:50.939
-will know about gum.
-TINA: Maybe.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.233
These are Andy's toenails
so they can clone him.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.485
And Ollie's toenails
so they can clone <i>him.</i>

03:55.568 --> 03:58.029
-Or mix them and make an Allie!
-Or an Olldie!

03:58.113 --> 04:00.198
-Or Michelle Pfeiffer!
-TINA: Maybe.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.450
50 years is, like, a really
annoying time to wait, Tina.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.452
But here, it's a tube of lip balm.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.538
Here's my wow needle-- it's on one.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.997
Uh, how dare you?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.750
Strawberry lemongrass
is the flavor of our time.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.670
Sorry, Tammy, I'm after history,
not a hissy-fit story.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.839
Oh, my God, Tina has so much power.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.758
-(Tammy grunts)
-My lip balm is cherry.

04:18.842 --> 04:21.553
<i>-(Teddy munching)</i>
<i>-LINDA: Teddy, slow down!</i>

04:21.636 --> 04:23.388
I'm hurrying 'cause
my truck's double-parked.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.764
If you see a cop just whistle.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.683
Well, I don't know how to whistle.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.976
How about I fart twice?

04:28.059 --> 04:29.269
One long, one short.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.438
Linda, you can't whistle?
Seriously?

04:31.521 --> 04:33.773
Um, isn't it weirder
that she can fart on command?

04:33.857 --> 04:35.275
One long and one short?

04:35.358 --> 04:37.485
Yeah, I can't whistle, Teddy.
So what?

04:37.569 --> 04:38.987
(whistles)
Oh, my God, sorry.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.196
That was so insensitive.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.990
It's okay! Relax.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.867
Yeah, lots of people can't whistle.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.785
I mean, I've never met one, besides Linda.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.662
They probably keep to themselves,

04:47.746 --> 04:49.998
because of, you know, the shame.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.833
-(scoffs) The shame?
-Sorry.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.002
I-I'm just biased because I happen to be

04:54.085 --> 04:55.211
a pretty good whistler.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.880
Or so people tell me a lot.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.214
-(Bob whistling)
-It's true.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.799
If "Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"

04:59.883 --> 05:02.677
comes on, watch out, Julio--
here comes this guy!

05:02.761 --> 05:05.055
Yeah, yeah, Mr. Flute-face over here.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.057
I can do some stuff you can't do.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.725
Like r-r-roll my Rs.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.018
Let's see you do that, big shot.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.604
You know I can't, Lin.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.314
Maybe today you can, try it.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.900
-(mumbling)
-Ha!

05:16.983 --> 05:19.152
Who cares?
Rolling Rs is a fringe sound.

05:19.235 --> 05:23.198
Whistling is-is like having...
a-a bird living inside of you.

05:23.281 --> 05:24.616
Oh, yeah, what kind of bird?

05:24.699 --> 05:26.785
A r-r-red br-r-reasted r-r-robin?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.787
Guys, please,
I-I didn't mean to start something.

05:28.870 --> 05:29.996
Teddy, you're getting a ticket.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.040
What?!
Linda, you were supposed to fart.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.959
So, Arnold, this is a piece

05:35.043 --> 05:37.295
of wood that you <i>say </i>you karate chopped.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.630
Impressive if true.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.173
<i>If </i>true...

05:40.256 --> 05:42.092
Dang, Tina's time capsule's
tougher to get into

05:42.175 --> 05:43.885
than a pistachio with no crack in it.

05:43.968 --> 05:46.096
I just swallow those whole. Is that bad?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.264
I don't think Tina knows what she wants.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.517
-What was that, Rudy?
-Nothing! They were talking!

05:50.600 --> 05:51.768
Checking in, Tina.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.353
How's the time capsule coming?

05:53.436 --> 05:54.771
So far we've got a lot of maybe-babies,

05:54.854 --> 05:56.231
but we're still in the discovery phase.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.817
Well, remember we have
to bury the capsule tomorrow.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.819
They're re-sodding
the school lawn this weekend.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.404
Because it's a mess.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.406
I don't know why they let kids
play on the grass.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.865
What is this, Switzerland?

06:05.949 --> 06:07.283
Also we dug a big hole in it.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.910
Oh, and I've decided to give you

06:08.993 --> 06:10.620
Buried Emotion Emma for the capsule.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.956
"Buried" and buried?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.541
(chuckles)
I couldn't resist.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.792
Also I'm mad at her.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.210
Uh, terrific.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.295
I'll just put that over here.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.588
Oh, come on.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.298
<i>RADIO DJ:</i>
<i>Hey, we've got the last pair</i>

06:22.382 --> 06:25.093
<i>of Boyz 4 Now tickets to give</i>
<i>away to the fourth caller!</i>

06:25.176 --> 06:27.929
Great!
This stupid contest is almost over, right?

06:28.013 --> 06:29.973
-(busy signal beeping)
-Crap, it's busy!

06:30.056 --> 06:32.559
-Redial, redial.
<i>-We have our lucky</i>
<i>fourth caller on the line!</i>

06:32.642 --> 06:33.852
-No.
<i>-Who's this?</i>

06:33.935 --> 06:35.645
<i>-Henry Haber.</i>
-What?!

06:35.729 --> 06:38.189
You don't have to ask me to turn
down my radio. (chuckles)

06:38.273 --> 06:39.399
<i>I understand feedback loops.</i>

06:39.482 --> 06:40.775
That guy should meet our Henry Haber.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.569
They sound like they'd hit it off.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.320
And my regards to the morning zoo.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.990
Henry, you like Boyz 4 Now?!
W-Why?!

06:47.073 --> 06:49.284
I don't listen to them,
but Susmita identifies

06:49.367 --> 06:51.327
as something called a Griffen Gal.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.871
It should've been me, not you.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.205
Not that I care.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.958
I'm just walking away.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.627
Okay, Tina, I've pressed
my face on some loose-leaf paper

06:59.711 --> 07:01.463
so future people can see
how I did my makeup.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.048
It's great, it's in, you're welcome.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.300
The only problem is that
Wagstaff is a grade school,

07:05.383 --> 07:07.135
-not a clown college.
-(grunts) That's it!

07:07.218 --> 07:09.346
You know what, I'm gonna do
my own time capsule.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.680
Your own time capsule?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.307
Yeah, and it's gonna be bigger

07:12.390 --> 07:14.809
and better and anyone
who wants to go into it, can.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.978
And forget 50 years.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.481
-We're gonna open it in a week!
-Wait, what?

07:19.564 --> 07:22.359
In a week, we'll know what
we were doing this week.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.902
I'll take that, thank you.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.612
Hot dang-- a Tam capsule!

07:25.695 --> 07:26.738
I want in!

07:26.821 --> 07:29.741
Wait... let me just... hold on, uh...

07:33.036 --> 07:35.038
Thank you, toss it on in.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.998
Welcome to the Tam Capsule.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.375
Uh, let's all slow down and take a breath.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.418
Peter, w-we were pretty close
to a deal, buddy.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.420
R-Rudy, l-l-let me read your poem again.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.673
-I know I missed something.
-Here's a poem for you, Tina.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.216
-Uh-huh?
-You snooze, you lose!

07:46.299 --> 07:49.135
-Oh.
-Why does poetry always go over my head?

07:49.219 --> 07:51.137
So can't you cancel Tammy's time capsule?

07:51.221 --> 07:54.808
Or-or tell the police
it's a drug chest full of drugs?

07:54.891 --> 07:56.976
I can't stop Tammy
from making a time capsule.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.896
I could barely stop that one kid
from keeping bees in his locker.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.356
There will just be two time capsules.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.858
Yours, which is the authorized,
official one.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.652
And then the cool one
that people want to be in.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.363
(groans) Anyway, looks like
I might be able to squeeze in

08:08.446 --> 08:09.531
Buried Emotion Emma after all.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.366
Oh, don't you wish.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.702
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>So now everybody wants</i>
to be in Tammy's time capsule

08:13.785 --> 08:15.328
and in 50 years when my capsule is opened,

08:15.412 --> 08:16.705
I'm gonna look completely ridiculous!

08:16.788 --> 08:18.331
Judging from the way Dad's aging,

08:18.415 --> 08:20.834
we're all gonna look completely
ridiculous long before that.

08:20.917 --> 08:21.960
Louise.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.294
Excuse me, Father,

08:23.378 --> 08:25.088
but I've also had a difficult day.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.215
I had to... console Tina

08:27.298 --> 08:29.300
when Henry Haber
ended up with the last two tickets

08:29.384 --> 08:30.510
to Boyz 4 Now.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.429
She's really struggling right now, Dad.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.847
-Look at her!
-Hmm?

08:33.930 --> 08:35.640
Aw, that's r-r-rotten, isn't it, Bob?

08:35.724 --> 08:37.100
R-R-Really, r-r-really r-r-rotten?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.268
Seriously, Lin?

08:38.351 --> 08:39.436
I know, nice accent.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.187
I'm loving Mom Connery.

08:41.271 --> 08:42.897
Gene, did you just say whistle something?

08:42.981 --> 08:43.898
-No.
-Okay.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.025
-(Bob whistling)
-Oh.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.152
You sound like a sexy teakettle.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.571
More caser-r-role, anyone?

08:49.654 --> 08:50.739
Caser-r-role?

08:50.822 --> 08:52.490
TINA:
This isn't casserole, but okay.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.784
Everything is casser-r-role!
Casser-r-role.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.619
-This is what I picture
their wedding night was like.
-Casser-r-role.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.413
<i>HENRY:</i>
<i>Susmita,</i>

08:58.496 --> 08:59.873
I don't understand why you're upset.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.667
You took my social studies
homework and corrected it.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.586
As a romantic surprise.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.338
You wrote "mediocre effort" on it.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.256
And the "O" in mediocre is a heart.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.216
-(grunts)
-Susmita!

09:10.300 --> 09:11.926
Hmm, trouble in Haber-dise?

09:12.010 --> 09:13.636
Wait a minute, all I have to do

09:13.720 --> 09:15.972
is date Henry Haber
and he'll do my homework?

09:16.056 --> 09:18.475
So, a lot of dirt,
but the new sod is coming

09:18.558 --> 09:20.435
and will look amazing for the one week

09:20.518 --> 09:21.936
you kids aren't allowed on it.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.189
And now, time capsule time.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.566
Thank you again, Mr. Branca,
for your digging.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.942
Now there are two holes.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.235
Still not my job.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.445
It's okay.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.947
Yes, we welcome Tammy's time capsule.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.532
Wow, look at the size of that thing.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.118
I had to stomp on the stuff
to get the lid shut.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.912
So what did you end up with, Tina?

09:38.995 --> 09:40.455
Looks like some barrettes...

09:40.538 --> 09:41.748
and a sticky note that says

09:41.831 --> 09:43.500
"IOU cool stuff from the past--

09:43.583 --> 09:45.627
Tina. Maybe check eBay?"

09:45.710 --> 09:47.337
Capsule? More like <i>crapsule.</i>

09:47.420 --> 09:49.005
-(blows raspberry)
-I know. I wanted this

09:49.089 --> 09:50.382
capsule to be full of amazing things

09:50.465 --> 09:51.591
that told a story about our time.

09:51.675 --> 09:52.926
It just didn't come together.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.053
-Let's just bury these things.
-Wait!

09:55.136 --> 09:56.805
I have something else
for the time capsule.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.224
-Henry, are you okay?
-Do I look okay?

09:59.307 --> 10:01.434
In general or right now?
Doesn't matter-- no.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.727
Susmita doesn't want to go with me

10:02.811 --> 10:04.688
to tomorrow night's Boyz 4 Now concert.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.731
I can't put my broken heart
in the capsule,

10:06.815 --> 10:09.317
but I can put in these two tickets.

10:09.401 --> 10:12.362
-(all gasping)
-The fool!

10:12.445 --> 10:14.948
I just saw the movie <i>Titanic</i>
and there's a beautiful scene

10:15.031 --> 10:17.992
involving Old Rose
and a heart-shaped necklace.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.328
Thanks, now I'm crying all over again.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.080
Those two empty front row seats

10:22.163 --> 10:24.582
with band meet-and-greet
and unlimited green room

10:24.666 --> 10:27.877
buffet privileges will be
a testament to my lost love.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.630
Cool gesture, Henry,
and mint unused tickets

10:30.714 --> 10:32.716
to the most influential boy band
of our time

10:32.799 --> 10:34.175
would pretty much save my crapsule,

10:34.259 --> 10:36.594
uh, capsule, but let's take a breath.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.888
You might get back together with Susmita,

10:38.972 --> 10:40.849
i-if you crazy kids can make that work.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.809
Or you could probably find someone

10:42.892 --> 10:44.769
to take those dumb things off your hands.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.855
(whispers):
Or I could find someone.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.733
-I just thought, I...
-I'll take 'em for my capsule-- done!

10:49.816 --> 10:51.985
-No!
-(gasps)
-Plant 'em.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.653
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>I can't believe Tammy did that.</i>

10:53.737 --> 10:55.363
Tacky ticket taker.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.532
Henry was trying to give them
to me, not her.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.743
-And then he was gonna give them to me.
-I know.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.161
And now those tickets
are in Tammy's capsule,

11:01.244 --> 11:02.412
four feet in the ground.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.913
-Just sitting there.
-Mocking us.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.290
-It's not right.
-It's bullcrap!

11:05.373 --> 11:06.666
It's all kinds of crap.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.501
Goat, donkey.
I-I don't know, camel?

11:08.585 --> 11:09.711
-Tina?
-Yes, Louise?

11:09.794 --> 11:11.546
Are we thinking the same thing?

11:11.629 --> 11:13.173
That it's amazing that
we haven't bumped into each other

11:13.256 --> 11:15.216
-once while mad pacing?
-That is, actually.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.843
-But, also, that we should...
-Dig them up and steal

11:16.926 --> 11:18.053
-those bad boys?
-Dig them up and steal...

11:18.136 --> 11:19.262
-Oh, my gosh!
-Yes.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.847
It's like we share a brain sometimes.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.223
Sister brain. I have to pee.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.017
Do you have to pee, too?
Sister bladder?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.811
Uh, no. Go pee and then
we'll figure this all out, buddy.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.939
(whoops)
Tina and I are gonna go to that show.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.066
(whoops)
Louise and I are putting those tickets

11:31.149 --> 11:32.233
in my time capsule.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.651
Sure you don't have to pee, Louise?

11:33.735 --> 11:35.528
We could go together.
Nope, can't wait.

11:38.740 --> 11:42.243
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>Stealing these tickets is going</i>
to be more than a two-girl job.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.870
It's a "two girl and one perky boy" job.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.288
So Gene will be joining us.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.123
He's excellent at blocking people's view

11:47.207 --> 11:49.542
when you don't want them to see
you digging up time capsules.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.961
-Just call me Gene the Screen.
-Hold on.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.838
Tammy said she's gonna open her
capsule in a week.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.132
If the tickets are missing,
someone's gonna guess it was us.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.761
-So we cover our trail
by leaving fake tickets.
-Fake tickets?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.680
After we dig them up,
we make perfect copies

12:01.763 --> 12:03.431
on Ms. Selbo's color copier.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.600
I once used it to counterfeit
a dollar and you...

12:05.684 --> 12:08.436
um, the person that
I gave it to never noticed.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.063
-W-Wait, what?
-Uh-huh. So, the time

12:10.146 --> 12:11.898
to pull this off is after school tomorrow

12:11.981 --> 12:14.234
before Mr. Branca locks up.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.069
Smart.
No one around, except office staff.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.946
And the kids who do clubs and activities.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.323
Slow down. You're saying
our school has clubs and activities?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.742
Tina, you'll dig while Gene
stands in front of you,

12:22.826 --> 12:25.078
inconspicuously blocking you from sight.

12:25.161 --> 12:28.248
I'll do tai chi like that cool
senior flash mob in the park.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.834
Then I'll talk my way past
Ms. Selbo and make the fakes.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.168
We'll put those in Tammy's capsule,

12:32.252 --> 12:33.378
and you'll bury it again.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.838
Wait, I'm doing all the digging?

12:34.921 --> 12:36.881
Yes, because you're the strongest, Tina.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.550
Especially when you get mad
about something.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.261
Yeah, then you get
crazy puberty Hulk strength.

12:41.344 --> 12:44.264
-No, I don't.
-Tina, Tammy stole those tickets.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.975
(shouts)
Oh, wow, I guess I do.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.522
Hey, Lin, have you seen our order-up bell?

12:52.605 --> 12:53.732
It's disappeared.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.567
-No, that's weird.
-Oh, no!

12:55.650 --> 12:58.403
I loved that bell.
It was good, it was pure.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.613
Yeah, I guess we'll have
to figure something else out.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.157
Oh, how about this?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.117
When an order's up, I'll whistle.

13:05.827 --> 13:08.121
Oh, no, our spindle's gone, too.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.956
What do we do with the old tickets?

13:10.040 --> 13:11.875
We'll have to r-r-roll them into a ball

13:11.958 --> 13:14.669
-and th-r-ow them away.
-Oh, boy.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.755
Oh, um, order up.
(whistles)

13:16.838 --> 13:19.007
-R-R-Rolling. Th-r-owing.
-Guys, guys, come on.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.800
We've all got our things, right?

13:20.884 --> 13:24.012
Me, I can make a sound like
I have a baby stuck in my throat.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.806
-Oh, my God.
-Scary.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.350
It doesn't make me better than anyone.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.976
Mort, you can probably do something.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.145
Well, I can click my jaw.
I have TMJ.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.856
-(clicking)
-More like TMI, Mort.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.743
Nothing to see here,
after-school activity kids.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.411
Just a boy doing tai chi outside

13:48.495 --> 13:50.830
to improve balance and prevent falls.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.540
Could really use
some digging help, Louise.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.126
Tina, look at my arms.
They're so small and spindly.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.753
How about this?
(gasps)

13:56.836 --> 13:59.756
Oh. Tammy's time capsule
just won a Capsy Award.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.177
-Here it is.
-Now we fake it to the limit.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.388
(shouts, grunts)
How are old people in the park

14:06.471 --> 14:07.889
so good at this?

14:09.099 --> 14:10.850
Hey, Ms. Selbo. What's up?

14:10.934 --> 14:13.645
Don't mind me,
I got to do some color copying.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.397
Oh, hi, Louise.
What are the copies for?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.232
They're for my many clubs and activities.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.067
I'm just gonna
load some card stock in here.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.735
Which clubs are you in?

14:20.819 --> 14:23.071
I thought I was pretty
on top of who's in each one.

14:23.154 --> 14:26.616
And who wishes they were in one.
Brian Schlesinger, Yearbook.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.243
Which clubs am I in? Huh.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.578
French Club, Junior Toastmasters.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.665
French Toastmasters.
Easier to talk about the clubs I'm not in.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.500
-Ha, ha, ha.
-(laughs)

14:35.583 --> 14:37.836
You know who else could
talk about the clubs he's not in?

14:37.919 --> 14:39.921
-Brian Schlesinger. (laughs)
-Ah, ha, ha.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.548
Keep dreaming, guy. Right?

14:41.631 --> 14:43.425
Okay, I'm done. Bye.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.927
In you go. Now we rebury.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.179
(grunting)
This is gonna work.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.140
Take that, Tammy's dumb capsule.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.558
TAMMY:
Uh, what are you doing?

14:51.641 --> 14:52.767
(gasps)
Tammy.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.936
And Jocelyn, also.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.479
Wait, why do you have a shovel?
Oh, my God.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.772
You were gonna take the tickets.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.774
No, we weren't.
Oh, yeah, we were.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.776
-(chuckles)
-I should be mad, but you know what?

15:01.860 --> 15:04.487
You saved us a lot of digging.
Let's have those tickets.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.239
-Or what?
-Or I'll say you stole them.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.408
Which you would only know if you
were trying to steal them.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.285
Oh, which you would only know
if you were trying

15:10.368 --> 15:12.662
-to steal them first.
-Which you would only know...

15:12.746 --> 15:14.164
Wait, I'm lost.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.666
This shovel's heavy.
I'm gonna put it down.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.293
Should I tai chi them out of here?

15:18.376 --> 15:20.337
Fine, Tammy, we give up.
Just take them.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.505
-Louise!
-She outsmarted us, Tina.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.633
-Let's go, Jocelyn.
-And could you guys put away
our shovel for us?

15:25.717 --> 15:28.053
-Thank you.
-Well, I guess that's it.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.096
-Except for one thing.
-Those weren't the real tickets.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.806
-These are.
-What?

15:31.890 --> 15:35.560
I made a few extra fakies
for just-in-case-kies. (laughs)

15:35.643 --> 15:37.562
-Good thinking.
-So, let's go the show!

15:37.645 --> 15:39.105
Yeah. Wait, um...

15:39.189 --> 15:40.523
Oh, you mean, put them in my capsule.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.317
-(laughs): What? No.
-Oh, dear.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.737
Are we not on the same page?
What happened to sister brain?

15:45.820 --> 15:47.655
You said you didn't
want to go to Boyz 4 Now.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.866
Duh, I didn't mean it.
You tried to talk Henry

15:49.949 --> 15:52.327
out of putting his tickets
in your stupid capsule.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.828
Duh, I didn't really mean that.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.372
I just didn't want him
to rush into anything.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.706
But hey, it's what Henry wanted.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.375
He just put them in the wrong capsule.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.918
It's a mistake a lot of people
have been making.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.336
-Don't you want to go?
-Of course I do.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.754
Of course I want to see that song

16:02.837 --> 16:03.922
where they bend over
and pick up your heart.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.215
It's called "Your Heart Fell on the Floor,

16:05.298 --> 16:07.342
-Let Me Get It for You."
-I know what it's called!

16:07.425 --> 16:09.135
But those tickets
belong in a time capsule.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.763
-So do you.
-Finally, a solution.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.598
(sighs)
All right, Tina.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.892
If you feel that strongly, here.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.812
Thanks, Louise.
Sorry I had to yell.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.939
(grunts)
Would you mind, uh, saying something

16:21.022 --> 16:22.774
to rev me up again?
You know, Hulk me?

16:22.857 --> 16:24.109
-Nope.
-I get it.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.152
(panting):
There.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.821
-(exhales)
-Oh, by the way, Tina,

16:27.904 --> 16:29.406
those were fake tickets, too.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.033
I still have the real ones.
Just-in-case-kies.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.618
-Damn it. Give them to me.
-Sure.

16:33.702 --> 16:36.454
Okay. Louise, before I go to
all the work of burying these...

16:36.538 --> 16:38.748
-Are they fake, too? Yeah.
-Son of a bitch.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.084
-How many pairs of fakes do you have left?
-So many.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.586
Um, can I see what the real ones
look like to compare?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.922
(chuckles): No. No, no, no.
Not falling for that.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.632
Oh, well, I gave it my best shot...
(grunts)

16:47.716 --> 16:49.467
-(grunts)
-Let go, Louise.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.594
-No!
-Oh, no, the sod crew.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.222
They're here already.
I have to get these in the ground now.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.932
Too bad, Tina.
What're you gonna do?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.642
Maybe tell them to sod off?

16:57.726 --> 17:00.437
I mean, when are you gonna have
a chance like that again?

17:03.314 --> 17:05.817
My God, they're sodding so fast.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.736
I need to get the tickets buried
before they get up to us.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.612
-They're gonna rip, Tina!
-Give them.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.532
Careful, Louise, she's puberty Hulking.

17:12.615 --> 17:13.867
(shouts)
Ha! They're mine.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.702
Sure, it's a sacrifice now,
but in 50 years,

17:15.785 --> 17:17.537
when the capsule is opened,
I'll be laughing.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.372
And maybe Boyz 4 Now
will honor the tickets then.

17:19.456 --> 17:22.500
They'll still be around, right?
I mean, not Matt, he'll be 104.

17:22.584 --> 17:25.920
Tina, I'm your sister.
Flesh and blood, here right now.

17:26.004 --> 17:28.631
Are you really gonna choose
people 50 years from now

17:28.715 --> 17:31.801
-over your butt
and my butt in those seats?
-Well, I...

17:31.885 --> 17:35.055
You can live your life
or you can put it in a box.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.098
Live, Tina. Live.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.684
(sighs) I-I just don't
want my time capsule to suck.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.394
Maybe it's supposed to suck.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.813
Maybe the last one sucked
because kids 50 years ago

17:43.897 --> 17:46.191
had better things to do
and were out living their lives.

17:46.274 --> 17:49.069
Yeah, racing for pinks
and making bathtub gin.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.321
(sighs) You're right.
Let's go to the show.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.323
-Yes!
-Yay, we're all going.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.325
Uh, Gene, there are only two tickets.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.994
That's enough, right?
One, two-- darn it!

17:58.078 --> 17:59.537
Hi, bye.
Just dropping off backpacks.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.039
We're on our way
to the Boyz 4 Now concert.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.458
Tina's really excited.
Settle down, Tina!

18:03.541 --> 18:04.959
Oh. Right, sorry.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.087
Oh, that's great.
How'd you get tickets?

18:07.170 --> 18:09.214
Just managed to dig some up somewhere.
(chuckles softly)

18:09.297 --> 18:11.049
-Ha!
-And I'm not going

18:11.132 --> 18:13.802
'cause I'm excited to spend time
with my two favorite parents.

18:13.885 --> 18:16.262
And you guys can fight
over who loves me the most.

18:16.346 --> 18:17.681
-And go.
-Wait.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.683
Shouldn't one of us be chaperoning?
Not it.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.142
Well, you'd need a ticket, but I guess

18:21.226 --> 18:23.603
you could pay a scalper $300 or so.

18:23.687 --> 18:24.813
Tina, you're in charge. Be safe.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.481
-Have fun.
-LOUISE: Out of the way, Teddy!

18:26.564 --> 18:29.109
-I mean, hi, Teddy!
-Oh, good. You guys are here.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.902
I've got kind of an emergency.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.237
What? What, Teddy?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.863
The Handyman's Jamboree is tonight,

18:33.947 --> 18:35.865
and my friend and colleague Handyman Sam

18:35.949 --> 18:38.243
wrote a song that
he and I have to perform.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.328
"Handyman's Jamboree"?

18:40.412 --> 18:42.372
Yes, Bob, a-and it's a huge deal.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.749
Sam said the song's to the tune
of "On Top of Old Smoky,"

18:44.833 --> 18:46.209
whatever the hell that is.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.836
Bob, do you know it?
Could you whistle it?

18:47.919 --> 18:49.754
Okay.
(whistling)

18:49.838 --> 18:52.549
Now, Linda, these are the words.
Would you mind singing?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.384
I-I don't know how it should sound.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.941
This is what Boyz 4 Now wishes they were.

19:10.025 --> 19:11.568
Eight more verses. Keep going.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.403
-Uh, no.
-Yeah, Teddy, we get it.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.863
We see what you're doing.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.573
(sighs)
Okay. Got to come clean.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.200
-There's no Handyman's Jamboree.
-We know.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.578
Handyman Sam is real,
but we're not friends.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.413
I-I just don't
want you to split up over this.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.248
-We're fine, Teddy.
-Yeah, we're not really...

19:25.331 --> 19:27.625
I mean, you guys complete each other.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.586
They're a couple of Jerry Maguires.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.213
-We did sound kind of good together.
-Could this be a thing?

19:32.297 --> 19:34.549
-Should we go to an open mic night?
-TEDDY: Uh...

19:34.632 --> 19:36.259
I don't know about an open mic,
but in the privacy

19:36.343 --> 19:38.178
of your own home, sure.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.639
These aren't genuine tickets, ladies.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.308
-BOTH: What?!
-I see this a lot.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.185
Welcome to the world.
People are garbage.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.020
-I'm so sad.
-(laughs)

19:47.103 --> 19:49.522
-My good man. What's...
-(buzzing)

19:49.606 --> 19:51.816
-happening?
-These tickets are fakes, miss.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.735
Uh, you need to calibrate your equipment.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.445
-They're real.
-Yeah, real fake.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.906
-Goodbye, innocence.
-But those are the real tickets.

19:57.989 --> 20:00.325
I was so careful.
Those are the real tickets!

20:00.408 --> 20:02.327
-I don't think we're getting in, Louise.
-I don't understand!

20:02.410 --> 20:04.579
If I don't have the real tickets,
who does?

20:04.662 --> 20:06.414
HENRY:
Can I see the washing instructions

20:06.498 --> 20:08.708
-on that glittery T-shirt?
-Henry Haber?

20:08.792 --> 20:12.128
-Susmita? How are you here?
-Oh, hi, Louise, Tina.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.173
Susmita heard about my <i>Titanic </i>thing
and changed her mind.

20:15.256 --> 20:18.927
I never knew Henry could be
that impulsive, and romantic.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.845
<i>So I dug up the tickets</i>
<i>right away and I left fakes</i>

20:20.929 --> 20:23.390
<i>'cause I didn't want to hurt</i>
<i>anyone's time capsule.</i>

20:23.473 --> 20:24.641
It's a victimless crime.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.476
It's not victimless.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.436
You're seeming really intense right now,

20:28.520 --> 20:30.063
so should we just go in?

20:30.146 --> 20:31.856
Can we go over the Boyz's names again
real quick

20:31.940 --> 20:33.775
-for when we meet them?
-Aah!

20:33.858 --> 20:36.611
Well, it's sweet that Henry
and Susmita are back together.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.238
-Mm...
-Nope.
-I don't know,

20:38.321 --> 20:39.906
maybe it's kind of nice
the way things worked out.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.574
-Wrong.
-It's not.
-Oh, my God.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.410
Oh, they're playing "Someday We'll Spoon."

20:47.414 --> 20:49.082
It's about the future.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.167
Kind of perfect, huh, 'cause
of the whole time capsule thing?

20:51.251 --> 20:52.460
Huh? Oh, right.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.961
