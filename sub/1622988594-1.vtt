WEBVTT

00:57.421 --> 01:00.488
The nearest galaxy,
the Canis Dwarf...

01:00.523 --> 01:03.161
know how long
it'd take to get there?

01:03.196 --> 01:05.427
I literally
have no idea.

01:05.829 --> 01:09.365
900 million years
with our current tech.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.203
25 thousand if you could
travel at the speed of light.

01:12.638 --> 01:14.733
So, you're saying
it's possible?

01:16.242 --> 01:17.538
Someday.

01:17.573 --> 01:20.574
I mean,
if you could build a ship

01:20.609 --> 01:23.115
that could travel
at the speed of light,

01:23.150 --> 01:24.611
you wouldn't experience
time at all.

01:25.482 --> 01:26.712
You wouldn't age a day.

01:27.181 --> 01:29.352
But when you got back,
all your friends

01:29.387 --> 01:30.848
and family would be gone.

01:31.317 --> 01:34.456
Yeah. Probably
the whole of humanity.

01:34.491 --> 01:36.260
What would be
the point, then?

01:38.429 --> 01:40.330
To find out what the point is!

01:56.414 --> 01:57.842
See you tomorrow?

01:57.877 --> 01:59.547
See you tomorrow.

03:19.893 --> 03:22.234
-Boxer.
- Boxer, it's Riggs.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.731
Sorry to be calling so early,
but a heart

03:24.766 --> 03:27.536
became available for
your patient, Serena Vazquez.

03:27.571 --> 03:30.000
The donor's an 18-year-old
male from Buffalo.

03:30.035 --> 03:33.278
Good news. What's the ETA
on the heart from Buffalo?

03:33.313 --> 03:35.841
9:25 a.m.
I'm on my way.

03:35.876 --> 03:38.283
ECHO and catch reports
are uploading.

03:38.318 --> 03:39.812
Thank you.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.617
What time is it?

03:43.686 --> 03:44.949
Ten 'til.

04:34.803 --> 04:37.034
Oh, shit.

04:38.774 --> 04:40.807
Shit.

04:48.652 --> 04:51.015
No yolk. Trust me.

04:52.755 --> 04:54.524
Thank you.

05:03.601 --> 05:05.304
They found Serena Vazquez
a heart?

05:06.206 --> 05:09.407
I'm happy for her. She has,
what, like seven grand kids?

05:09.442 --> 05:10.804
Five.

05:10.839 --> 05:12.806
And I personally
think she's too old.

05:12.841 --> 05:15.446
But there are others on the
committee who felt differently.

05:20.717 --> 05:22.915
While you silently judge me...

05:23.284 --> 05:25.555
which is beginning
to feel like a theme...

05:26.357 --> 05:29.856
please consider there may be
other, more deserving patients.

05:34.929 --> 05:36.533
I'll see you at the hospital.

05:37.668 --> 05:39.701
Don't be ridiculous.
I'll drive you.

05:51.814 --> 05:53.649
Big storm brewing for this

05:53.684 --> 05:56.047
upcoming weekend
here in Manhattan but it seems

05:56.082 --> 05:58.489
like the worst weather
is over the weekend, so--

06:01.462 --> 06:03.560
...gorgeous
day here in New York City

06:03.595 --> 06:05.760
as we get up to
around 48 degrees,

06:05.795 --> 06:07.894
and the low 50s
for the rest of the week...

06:10.668 --> 06:12.899
-Dinner after the shift?
-Really?

06:12.934 --> 06:14.934
You're still not
taking me to the door?

06:14.969 --> 06:16.474
Jordan, please. It's--

06:16.509 --> 06:18.476
Unprofessional. I know,
I get it.

06:22.911 --> 06:24.878
Boxer, the only one that
I'm silently judging

06:24.913 --> 06:27.485
in this, whatever this is...

06:28.213 --> 06:29.784
is myself.

06:56.912 --> 06:58.142
Hey, clear the entrance.

06:58.177 --> 06:59.715
What's going on here?

06:59.750 --> 07:01.552
These two patients
are together.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.620
-They were airlifted in--
-She's not the one

07:03.655 --> 07:05.457
in critical condition!
You treat the boy first.

07:08.792 --> 07:10.990
Dr. Taylor, can you
help me check him in?

07:11.025 --> 07:13.091
Please, check him in properly.

07:13.126 --> 07:14.994
Trip Granger,
he has a heart condition.

07:15.029 --> 07:16.798
He's a patient of Dr. Boxer.

07:16.833 --> 07:19.196
-Are you the mother?
-No, she's my attorney.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.066
He's my son.

07:51.934 --> 07:54.770
So what's
the verdict, Taylor?

07:54.805 --> 07:56.904
Should they be diggin'
that hole for me or what?

07:56.939 --> 08:00.006
The verdict is,
there's no verdict.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.975
I still have to do
a full blood work-up.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.915
You're sweet, but...
you don't need blood work

08:07.950 --> 08:10.148
to tell ya what you
can see with your own eyes.

08:10.183 --> 08:11.622
What's that, Walter?

08:11.657 --> 08:13.492
I'm a fat ass with a bad heart.

08:14.858 --> 08:17.188
No one is digging any holes.

08:17.223 --> 08:19.993
You're up for reclassification
today. Let's stay positive.

08:20.996 --> 08:22.897
Make me a deal, Taylor.

08:22.932 --> 08:25.801
I want to watch "The Bachelor"
with my daughters,

08:25.836 --> 08:27.704
and eat my wife's
shitty meatloaf.

08:28.473 --> 08:32.808
-I think we can arrange that.
- No. At home.

08:33.610 --> 08:37.747
If I get rejected again,
just let me go home.

08:42.182 --> 08:43.984
When he calls, please,

08:44.019 --> 08:46.085
do not answer the phone.
We need everything on paper.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.120
I heard you
the first time--

08:48.155 --> 08:49.924
Yeah,
but I apparently--

08:49.959 --> 08:52.025
You wanted to see me?

08:52.660 --> 08:55.028
I'm sorry,
am I interrupting?

08:55.063 --> 08:56.733
Have a seat, Dr. Taylor.

08:56.768 --> 08:59.131
I'd like you
to meet Father Dunbar.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.770
He's consulting for the board.

09:00.805 --> 09:02.937
Charlie. Charlie Dunbar.

09:02.972 --> 09:05.038
Are you, um,
a spiritual consultant?

09:05.073 --> 09:08.140
Legal, actually. I've only
been ordained for three years.

09:08.175 --> 09:10.208
Before that, I was
a defense attorney for 15.

09:10.243 --> 09:11.682
Quite the skill set.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.947
Tell that to my ex-wife.

09:16.249 --> 09:17.787
I understand
you've been interviewing

09:17.822 --> 09:19.349
for the Heart Committee.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.087
Word on the street
is you're quite

09:21.122 --> 09:22.726
the up-and-comer
in cardiac surgery.

09:22.761 --> 09:24.189
She's fantastic.

09:24.224 --> 09:25.993
I see you started
your residency in...

09:26.028 --> 09:28.600
-plastic surgery?
-Her mother's Nadia Taylor.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.899
She's a cosmetic.

09:30.934 --> 09:33.264
If you were a middle-aged
woman from the Upper East Side,

09:33.299 --> 09:34.738
you would know her.

09:36.170 --> 09:38.137
Why didn't you
follow in her footsteps?

09:38.172 --> 09:41.976
I watched a friend from college
die waiting for a heart.

09:42.011 --> 09:43.615
Ah.

09:44.050 --> 09:47.080
The Lenox Hill committee denied
her a status upgrade twice.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.688
I'm sure
they had their reasons.

09:50.723 --> 09:51.953
And that didn't make
you ambivalent

09:51.988 --> 09:53.317
about these committees?

09:54.419 --> 09:57.926
Honestly? I am
a little ambivalent.

09:57.961 --> 09:59.763
Ideally, no one
should have the right

09:59.798 --> 10:01.292
to decide who gets priority.

10:01.327 --> 10:03.162
But I'm optimistic
that one day,

10:03.197 --> 10:05.032
we won't have
an organ shortage.

10:05.067 --> 10:07.639
I think we'll figure out
a way to fix this problem.

10:07.674 --> 10:11.038
Until then, this system,
it's the best we've got.

10:11.073 --> 10:12.974
It's the only one we've got.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.977
What I'm trying to say is,
that I trust myself,

10:16.012 --> 10:19.145
which is why I want
to be a part of this process.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.854
Well, you got the position,
Dr. Taylor.

10:27.056 --> 10:28.693
Today's session
starts at 8:00,

10:28.728 --> 10:30.420
so you have an hour
to do your rounds.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.829
Thank you, both.
You will not be disappointed.

10:57.317 --> 10:59.284
Trip's stable
for the time being.

10:59.319 --> 11:01.352
That doesn't sound
very promising.

11:01.387 --> 11:03.189
He's going to need
that transplant sooner

11:03.224 --> 11:04.454
than we anticipated.

11:04.489 --> 11:05.928
How soon?

11:07.360 --> 11:09.096
Move him up the list.

11:09.131 --> 11:10.867
You know that's not
how it works.

11:10.902 --> 11:12.770
This morning,
the committee

11:12.805 --> 11:15.003
-will discuss upgrading his--
-MOVE HIM UP THE LIST!

11:18.745 --> 11:20.437
I apologize.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.275
If he's been using again,
there is nothing I can do.

11:25.917 --> 11:27.444
Look after my boy, Andre.

12:54.071 --> 12:55.334
Jesus Christ.

13:30.976 --> 13:36.111
Technically, you'd refer to him
as TS-16, or "Test Subject 16."

13:36.780 --> 13:38.608
But folks around
the lab have given him

13:38.643 --> 13:41.050
a nickname: Columbus

13:41.085 --> 13:42.986
.

13:43.021 --> 13:45.153
Columbus is the first animal
to carry a humanized organ

13:45.188 --> 13:48.288
we believe can be safely
used for transplantation.

13:48.890 --> 13:50.928
In his case, it's a kidney.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.259
As you know,
Xenotransplantation

13:52.294 --> 13:54.426
is hardly a novel concept.

13:54.461 --> 13:56.329
Doctors and scientists
have been trying

13:56.364 --> 13:59.596
to exchange organs and
tissue cross-species for years.

14:00.165 --> 14:04.304
Up until now, it hasn't worked.

14:04.339 --> 14:07.945
What is unique about X-Origins
is that we've created

14:07.980 --> 14:11.377
a patented gene-editing tool
that helps to produce organs

14:11.412 --> 14:14.116
that the host immune system
won't reject.

14:14.151 --> 14:16.250
In other words,
we harnessed this technology

14:16.285 --> 14:20.452
on pigs so that it can
become a reality for humans.

14:20.487 --> 14:22.960
In the prospectus,
it says human testing

14:22.995 --> 14:25.897
is 24 months away.
Why so far out?

14:25.932 --> 14:29.131
The FDA requires
two years of nonhuman trials.

14:29.166 --> 14:32.035
There is a pig exactly
like this one

14:32.070 --> 14:35.973
who is carrying a kidney that
was engineered for a monkey.

14:37.405 --> 14:38.943
That's where we start.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.637
So when
would we start recouping?

14:41.706 --> 14:45.543
I won't lie to you. Uh,
it's gonna take quite a while.

14:49.549 --> 14:51.989
Allow me to say this,
if I can...

14:53.421 --> 14:57.687
If we are successful,
this tech will eradicate

14:57.722 --> 15:01.097
the tremendous need for
healthy human organs worldwide.

15:02.397 --> 15:04.936
We will
revolutionize transplantation.

15:11.505 --> 15:13.142
And if you don't give a shit

15:13.177 --> 15:15.243
about changing the world,
that's okay.

15:15.278 --> 15:17.641
You can still enjoy
the obscene amount of money

15:17.676 --> 15:19.247
I'm gonna make you.

16:28.252 --> 16:30.153
Hey, it's Riggs.

16:30.188 --> 16:32.023
I'm leaving Buffalo
with the heart.

16:32.058 --> 16:34.025
Should be touching down
on schedule.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.105
Mrs. Vazquez.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.570
UNOS has found a match for you,
from a donor upstate.

16:51.605 --> 16:54.375
My colleague is on his way
to retrieve the organ.

16:54.410 --> 16:56.377
I will be performing
the transplant.

16:56.412 --> 16:59.677
My associate, Dr. Pope, will be
prepping you in 20 minutes.

17:01.285 --> 17:03.615
Do you have any questions?

17:05.487 --> 17:07.520
Am I dreaming?

17:07.555 --> 17:09.324
No,
you're not dreaming.

17:11.724 --> 17:14.560
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Boxer.

17:19.237 --> 17:21.072
Trip Granger will be dead
in a week

17:21.107 --> 17:22.370
if he doesn't get a transplant.

17:22.405 --> 17:24.438
It's on the docket.

17:24.473 --> 17:26.209
Let's hope he's laid off
the marching powder.

17:26.244 --> 17:28.112
Well, his blood won't lie.

17:28.147 --> 17:30.081
Though I'm sure the elder
Granger wishes it could.

17:30.116 --> 17:31.643
What did he say
when you saw him?

17:31.678 --> 17:33.315
Nothing he hasn't already.

17:33.350 --> 17:35.416
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

17:35.451 --> 17:37.649
-Why, Val, what's up?
-Nothing.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.589
I hear the board's
up in arms about

17:43.624 --> 17:45.393
the rating downgrade.

17:45.428 --> 17:47.362
Brought in a consultant
to audit the program.

17:47.397 --> 17:48.759
With the budget cuts,
we are officially

17:48.794 --> 17:50.497
on the cutting board.

17:50.532 --> 17:52.433
Jesus, that'd be
incredibly short-sighted.

17:52.468 --> 17:54.336
They wouldn't even let me
hand-pick your replacement.

17:54.371 --> 17:56.239
Who'd they go with?

18:02.346 --> 18:04.478
Good morning, Dr. Boxer.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.351
-You're in my seat.
-Excuse me?

18:11.289 --> 18:15.126
I'm kidding. Welcome
to the committee, Dr. Taylor.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.491
Always
the charmer, Boxer!

18:18.026 --> 18:20.725
I'm Allen Lau,
the shrink on this ship.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.331
Jordan Taylor.
Great to meet you.

18:23.133 --> 18:26.500
So, as you have no doubt
noticed, we have a new face.

18:26.535 --> 18:28.865
Dr. Taylor is gonna be
taking over for Boxer

18:28.900 --> 18:31.571
when he leaves us to join
the private sector next month.

18:31.973 --> 18:34.277
Until that time, we're gonna
roll with a six-man committee.

18:34.312 --> 18:36.114
Guys, it is an honor.

18:36.850 --> 18:39.678
I'd like to jump right in,
'cause I've got some good news.

18:39.713 --> 18:42.615
One of our own, Serena Vazquez,
is getting a heart.

18:45.224 --> 18:47.356
The donor is an 18-year-old
boy from Buffalo.

18:47.391 --> 18:49.688
Dr. Riggs is bringing
the organ home as we speak.

18:49.723 --> 18:51.855
Boxer's operating,
incision time is 9 a.m.

18:53.232 --> 18:54.693
I'll be scrubbing up
in 30 minutes.

18:54.728 --> 18:56.662
May we make this short
and sweet, please?

18:56.697 --> 18:59.335
Our first patient
is up for reclassification.

18:59.370 --> 19:02.503
Walter Curtis, who has DCM.

19:02.538 --> 19:06.903
He is currently Status 1-B, but
his condition has deteriorated.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.642
Positives: He's 48,
he's employed.

19:09.677 --> 19:11.545
He has a strong support system.

19:11.580 --> 19:15.615
I'm married. And I've got
three beautiful daughters

19:15.650 --> 19:18.915
And negatives: he's 5'9,
335 pounds.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.589
Bipolar, but I did
pass my last psych eval.

19:22.624 --> 19:26.329
Primary insurance, but... I
don't have a secondary policy.

19:27.098 --> 19:29.530
I'd like to point out
that Walter

19:29.565 --> 19:31.763
has lost eight pounds
since he's been here.

19:32.931 --> 19:34.634
How long has he been here?

19:34.669 --> 19:37.538
-It's still progress.
-Three months.

19:37.573 --> 19:39.309
Three months
of controlled diet,

19:39.344 --> 19:41.575
he's lost
a measly eight pounds.

19:41.610 --> 19:44.380
Richard Simmons wouldn't blush.
We wouldn't be

19:44.415 --> 19:46.679
giving him a heart,
we'd be giving him a time bomb.

19:46.714 --> 19:48.516
Well, don't
sugarcoat it, Boxer.

19:48.551 --> 19:50.485
-Statistics don't lie.
-But they never tell

19:50.520 --> 19:52.553
the whole story either,
which is why we're here.

19:52.588 --> 19:55.325
Let's hear from Dr. Taylor,
Walter's her patient...

19:59.694 --> 20:01.562
I think that Walter's trying.

20:01.597 --> 20:03.333
Actually, I know
that he's trying.

20:04.035 --> 20:06.435
He's not blessed
with a good metabolism,

20:06.470 --> 20:08.470
but should that preclude him
from getting a heart?

20:08.505 --> 20:10.307
I don't think so.

20:10.342 --> 20:11.605
He's putting three daughters
through college

20:11.640 --> 20:13.343
on a doorman's salary.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.740
And for that
he deserves a heart?

20:14.775 --> 20:16.511
And a Nobel Prize!

20:16.546 --> 20:18.744
Look, he's reliable,
he takes his medication.

20:18.779 --> 20:20.812
He's a cheerleader
for the entire ward--

20:20.847 --> 20:22.781
And he plays guitar,
and he makes finger puppets

20:22.816 --> 20:25.256
for pediatrics. This is not
a congeniality contest.

20:25.291 --> 20:28.622
If you would let us finish,
Dr. Boxer, what we're trying

20:28.657 --> 20:31.625
to say... is that Walter
has the right disposition.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.462
He can handle it.

20:33.497 --> 20:35.563
Walter's medical bills
are half a million, easy.

20:35.598 --> 20:38.302
It's difficult to justify
adding another 200K

20:38.337 --> 20:39.897
to such a high-risk patient.

20:39.932 --> 20:44.638
With all due respect...
how can you quantify it?

20:44.673 --> 20:46.640
We could add years
to Walter's life.

20:46.675 --> 20:49.005
-You don't know.
- No, I don't know.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.578
But I have to quantify it.

20:50.613 --> 20:52.745
I'm responsible
for this program.

20:52.780 --> 20:54.747
We've had some issues recently.

20:54.782 --> 20:57.013
US News downgraded our rating.

20:57.048 --> 20:59.719
Nine heart rejections
within the last year.

20:59.754 --> 21:01.358
It's just dumb,
bad luck--

21:01.393 --> 21:03.019
Or poor
decision-making.

21:03.054 --> 21:05.791
Based on criteria more
sentimental than scientific.

21:05.826 --> 21:08.024
We all have a voice,
we all come at this

21:08.059 --> 21:10.026
from different angles.
It's why the process works.

21:10.061 --> 21:13.997
I would like to propose
moving Walter up to Status 1-A.

21:14.032 --> 21:17.605
Dr. Riggs has already e-mailed
in his vote. He's in favor.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.607
-Dr. Gilroy?
-Not in favor.

21:19.642 --> 21:22.379
-Dr. Boxer?
-No.

21:22.414 --> 21:24.480
-Dr. Lau?
-I'm abstaining.

21:24.515 --> 21:25.745
I have a conflict.

21:27.012 --> 21:28.913
Dr. Taylor?
You're the decider.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.497
Yes. I vote yes.

21:42.962 --> 21:46.601
Walter Curtis
is upped to Status 1-A.

21:53.544 --> 21:55.346
It's Dr. Pope.

21:55.381 --> 21:56.875
There's been
a complication in the OR.

21:56.910 --> 21:58.547
Serena Vazquez is dead.

22:00.947 --> 22:02.386
What?

22:02.421 --> 22:03.981
The fuck are you talking about?

22:04.016 --> 22:05.719
She coded on the table.

22:05.754 --> 22:08.392
Resuscitation failed...
prep was going fine,

22:08.427 --> 22:09.987
and her heart, it just stopped.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.097
Did you call Riggs?

22:21.132 --> 22:23.407
Yes. He's already in the air
with the donor heart.

22:23.442 --> 22:25.002
-UNOS?
-No time to redirect it.

22:25.037 --> 22:26.740
So, what do you suggest we do?

22:26.775 --> 22:28.577
It goes to somebody
else in this hospital.

22:28.612 --> 22:30.381
We can't waste a heart.

22:31.549 --> 22:32.878
It has to be beating
by 11:00 a.m.,

22:32.913 --> 22:34.616
which means we need to be

22:34.651 --> 22:36.816
prepping someone else by 9:30,
the latest.

22:36.851 --> 22:38.554
That is our true expiration.

22:40.987 --> 22:42.558
Who are the other matches?

22:42.826 --> 22:44.791
Walter Curtis is a match.

22:44.826 --> 22:47.057
I don't know about the rest,
I'd have to check.

22:47.092 --> 22:49.466
Then, check. We reconvene in
ten, sort through the matches,

22:49.501 --> 22:51.666
-make a decision.
- Where are you going?

22:51.701 --> 22:53.734
To tell Mr. Vazquez
his wife is dead.

23:32.709 --> 23:35.941
Talk about gettin' thrown into
the fire on your first day.

23:37.549 --> 23:40.044
Is UNOS going to have
an issue if we make the call?

23:40.079 --> 23:41.551
Never happened before.

23:42.287 --> 23:45.082
We don't have time
for their bureaucratic red tape.

23:45.117 --> 23:46.952
That heart'll expire.

23:52.025 --> 23:55.862
Boxer, one month.
You are out of here in a month.

23:56.764 --> 23:59.162
Until then, we need
to be able to work together.

23:59.197 --> 24:00.636
Can we do that?

24:04.576 --> 24:06.609
In real life,
we're obviously finished.

24:12.045 --> 24:14.012
I shouldn't have
let things escalate.

24:15.818 --> 24:17.521
I hurt you.

24:17.556 --> 24:18.819
I'm sorry.

24:25.861 --> 24:28.026
You know what hurts?

24:28.061 --> 24:30.897
It's not the fact that
you're a self-absorbed asshole.

24:30.932 --> 24:33.163
I blame myself
for thinking that

24:33.198 --> 24:35.000
you could be any different.

24:35.969 --> 24:39.774
What hurts is that you
don't think I'm a good doctor.

24:39.809 --> 24:41.578
Never said that.

24:41.613 --> 24:43.580
But you don't want me
on the committee.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.648
I just don't
think you're cut out for this.

24:45.683 --> 24:47.144
And why is that?

24:47.813 --> 24:50.521
You don't realize
the heart is just a muscle.

25:01.831 --> 25:04.931
How many
chances does this woman get?

25:04.966 --> 25:08.099
She's ballooned to 240 pounds.

25:08.134 --> 25:10.871
We've given her
a bed for five months.

25:10.906 --> 25:15.304
Unfortunately, we need
to cut our losses. I vote no.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.614
I vote yes.
Move her up.

25:17.649 --> 25:19.715
Dr. Taylor?

25:22.885 --> 25:25.589
Dr. Taylor?
You're the decider.

25:35.766 --> 25:37.326
No.

25:37.361 --> 25:42.672
Gail Berry, upgrade denied.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.206
Priority
should be geographic!

25:49.241 --> 25:51.340
One, Albany. Two, Trenton.
Three, White Plains.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.749
Bullshit. Albany
is a kidney. In what universe

25:53.784 --> 25:55.850
do you cut out
a kidney before a heart?

25:55.885 --> 25:57.786
Heart's staying
in the hospital. No transport.

25:57.821 --> 25:59.117
It seems logical to me.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.120
Everybody, please,
just calm down.

26:04.828 --> 26:06.729
Will you all
just shut the fuck up!

26:07.398 --> 26:10.062
Operational priorities do not
deviate based on geography.

26:10.097 --> 26:11.932
One, heart.
Two, liver. Three, kidneys--

26:11.967 --> 26:13.703
I think
we got it under control.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.672
I don't really give a fuck
what you think.

26:15.707 --> 26:17.168
And you are?

26:17.203 --> 26:18.675
I'm Director of the
Transplant Program

26:18.710 --> 26:20.204
at this hospital.

26:20.639 --> 26:23.812
Dr. Taylor? Apologies.

26:23.847 --> 26:25.913
We weren't briefed
on local protocol.

26:25.948 --> 26:28.014
Oh, yes, you were, honey.
You just had your head

26:28.049 --> 26:30.082
stuck too far up
your ass to listen.

26:30.117 --> 26:31.347
Babysit them.

26:33.054 --> 26:34.284
Carry on!

26:41.832 --> 26:43.161
Jesus.

26:58.310 --> 27:00.145
I'm confused, Emmett.

27:00.914 --> 27:03.346
My attorney's just still
waiting on signatures.

27:03.381 --> 27:05.722
Is there
some issue with the docs?

27:06.157 --> 27:08.054
Paperwork was fine.

27:08.089 --> 27:10.287
The others are welcome
to invest.

27:10.322 --> 27:12.322
You know they won't come in
unless you do.

27:12.357 --> 27:14.390
Were we not
at the same meeting?

27:14.425 --> 27:16.227
You mean the one
where you promised us

27:16.262 --> 27:18.427
"obscene" sums of money?

27:18.462 --> 27:21.364
So? What the fuck
is happening?

27:21.999 --> 27:23.674
You haven't
disclosed everything.

27:25.139 --> 27:26.908
You think
I'm lying about the tech?

27:27.911 --> 27:29.977
No. Not the tech.

27:31.343 --> 27:33.244
You're lying about your health.

27:37.723 --> 27:38.986
Your heart is failing.

27:39.388 --> 27:40.988
You won't live to see
your project

27:41.023 --> 27:42.825
to the end
without a transplant.

27:44.895 --> 27:46.928
My files are confidential.

27:46.963 --> 27:50.767
It's ironic,
tragically so. I'm very sorry.

27:50.802 --> 27:54.364
I can set a meeting
with my successor.

27:54.399 --> 27:56.201
I'm working with some
of the finest doctors

27:56.236 --> 27:58.302
and scientists in the world.

27:58.337 --> 28:02.306
Andre, I invested in you.
Not your team.

28:04.178 --> 28:07.476
You know, this is the first
start-up that I've invested in,

28:07.511 --> 28:10.050
because I believe
in what you're doing!

28:10.886 --> 28:13.317
But you're asking
for very big money now.

28:14.518 --> 28:16.353
Let me ask
you something, Emmett:

28:18.291 --> 28:21.259
Do I strike you as the kind
of guy who takes risks?

28:25.936 --> 28:27.936
Okay.

28:30.303 --> 28:34.470
If you agree to a transplant,
I'll draw down.

28:36.210 --> 28:40.146
I can't just agree
to a transplant.

28:40.181 --> 28:41.851
You read the file.

28:43.349 --> 28:45.151
I'll find you a heart.

28:50.389 --> 28:52.290
That's all I can offer.

28:54.833 --> 28:57.130
I can't.

29:16.855 --> 29:18.481
Okay...

29:18.850 --> 29:23.123
The incoming heart
is O positive, 310 grams.

29:23.158 --> 29:26.060
As I mentioned,
Walter Curtis is a match,

29:26.095 --> 29:29.162
and there are two other 1-A
matches in the hospital. I--

29:31.034 --> 29:32.363
Excuse me, we're in a meeting.

29:32.398 --> 29:34.167
My apologies
for being late, Val.

29:34.202 --> 29:36.367
I was already on the train
when I got your message.

29:36.402 --> 29:38.567
Guys, this is
Father Dunbar.

29:38.602 --> 29:41.042
He is a former attorney
representing the board.

29:41.411 --> 29:45.277
Father, this is Dr. Boxer,
Dr. Lau, Nurse Wilkes.

29:45.312 --> 29:47.884
And, of course,
you know Dr. Taylor.

29:47.919 --> 29:50.117
Why exactly is he here?

29:50.486 --> 29:53.450
Because Trip Granger
is a match for this heart.

29:53.485 --> 29:55.551
Boxer is correct.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.828
Trip Granger?
I checked him in this morning.

29:57.863 --> 29:59.258
His father's Emmett Granger.

29:59.293 --> 30:01.062
Granger Venture Partners.

30:01.097 --> 30:02.833
What does Trip do?

30:02.868 --> 30:04.296
He tans well,
parties even better,

30:04.331 --> 30:06.199
and has a unique talent
for ending up

30:06.234 --> 30:07.871
on Page Six for the latter.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.369
Trip had a heart
attack early this morning.

30:12.238 --> 30:15.142
He was airlifted from Montauk
on his father's jet.

30:15.177 --> 30:17.980
We're also treating
his girlfriend, Holly Matson.

30:18.749 --> 30:22.182
I saw her today, too.
She was cut up pretty badly.

30:22.217 --> 30:23.920
That's strange...

30:25.924 --> 30:27.484
No, Trip
didn't have any lacerations.

30:27.519 --> 30:29.552
I'm assuming they were
in some sort of accident?

30:31.127 --> 30:33.556
Why do we suddenly need
a spiritual/legal/

30:33.591 --> 30:35.866
whatever-you-are watchdog?

30:35.901 --> 30:38.198
The circumstances have changed.
I have a letter from the board.

30:39.498 --> 30:41.267
"At approximately 5:15 a.m.,

30:41.302 --> 30:44.270
Emmett Granger contacted
Chairman Scott Lacey.

30:44.305 --> 30:46.371
He wanted the board to be
aware of his appreciation

30:46.406 --> 30:48.175
for past care,
and understood that we would

30:48.210 --> 30:50.441
do everything humanly
possible for his son.

30:50.476 --> 30:54.016
As a show of gratitude, and
regardless of Trip's prognosis,

30:54.051 --> 30:55.578
he informed Chairman Lacey

30:55.613 --> 30:59.021
that he would recommend
a $25 million grant

30:59.056 --> 31:02.288
from The Granger Institute
to St. Augustine Hospital.

31:02.323 --> 31:05.093
The board places full trust
in you, the Heart Committee,

31:05.128 --> 31:07.524
to make the right decision
regarding Trip Granger."

31:09.033 --> 31:12.133
You can't be serious.
$25 million?

31:12.168 --> 31:14.630
I don't get out of bed
for less than 30.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.973
What does it mean,
he would "recommend"

31:17.008 --> 31:18.909
a grant
from the Granger Institute?

31:18.944 --> 31:20.504
He is the Granger Institute.

31:20.539 --> 31:22.539
It's a loophole.

31:22.574 --> 31:25.080
We don't get the money
if Trip doesn't get the heart.

31:25.115 --> 31:27.049
-He's bribing us.
-Bingo.

31:27.084 --> 31:28.446
Not exactly.

31:28.481 --> 31:30.118
"Regardless
of Trip's prognosis."

31:32.958 --> 31:35.387
Disregard the letter.
We remain objective.

31:35.422 --> 31:37.224
I hope we can.

31:37.259 --> 31:40.128
Unconsciously, this could
prejudice us against Trip.

31:40.163 --> 31:43.131
Or the opposite.
Come on, let's be real.

31:43.166 --> 31:45.331
This place
has seen better days.

31:45.366 --> 31:48.268
Our equipment is prehistoric,
we're short-staffed.

31:48.303 --> 31:51.205
They can't even finish
the renovation, for God's sake!

31:51.874 --> 31:55.704
We pick Trip, and we're saving
much more than one patient.

31:55.739 --> 31:58.014
Now, of course, we can't
let the money decide,

31:58.049 --> 32:00.115
but black and white this ain't.

32:00.150 --> 32:02.579
I disagree. I think
the money should be irrelevant.

32:02.614 --> 32:05.153
I'm surprised the board
would even make us aware.

32:05.188 --> 32:06.583
You are so young.

32:08.158 --> 32:11.159
The board wants Trip
to get the heart.

32:11.194 --> 32:12.589
Uh, that's false.

32:12.624 --> 32:14.360
They were concerned
that Mr. Granger

32:14.395 --> 32:16.197
would reach out
to one of you personally.

32:16.232 --> 32:18.232
They sent me to ensure
that any decision you make

32:18.267 --> 32:20.069
would be irrefutable.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.434
As you know, many
of these transplant decisions

32:22.469 --> 32:24.568
-end up in courtrooms.
-Very clever,

32:24.603 --> 32:27.274
sending in a priest
to do their dirty work.

32:27.309 --> 32:30.244
All right, just relax. We're
waiting on Trip's drug results.

32:30.279 --> 32:31.707
The decision
could be made for us.

32:31.742 --> 32:33.643
-How so?
-If a patient's been using,

32:33.678 --> 32:35.986
they're ineligible. UNOS rules.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.988
As you may have
gleaned from our rating,

32:38.023 --> 32:40.056
it's hard enough to keep
a transplanted heart ticking.

32:40.091 --> 32:42.256
You add chems to that,
and it's sayonara, baby.

32:42.891 --> 32:45.028
And Trip
isn't exactly a saint.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.063
He OD'd on cocaine
nine months ago.

32:47.098 --> 32:49.626
Let's table Trip and move on.
Who's the other match?

33:17.590 --> 33:19.722
Sorry, Andy.

33:35.575 --> 33:37.344
Uh, Macallan, neat.

33:38.013 --> 33:41.546
And a Ketel One martini
for the lady, extra dry.

33:42.780 --> 33:44.417
Good memory.

33:44.452 --> 33:46.287
I always remember
a person's drink.

33:46.322 --> 33:48.652
It's like a window
into the soul.

33:49.421 --> 33:51.688
I actually really
should be getting home.

33:51.723 --> 33:54.295
One drink. We're celebrating.

33:54.330 --> 33:56.099
What's the occasion?

33:57.564 --> 34:00.334
Yesterday, there were
nine programs in the U.S.

34:00.369 --> 34:02.204
with a rating north of 85.

34:02.239 --> 34:04.371
Today, my friend,
there are ten.

34:04.406 --> 34:07.341
You complete me, Dr. Taylor.

34:09.708 --> 34:11.444
You don't seem pleased.

34:11.813 --> 34:14.447
I guess I-- I just,
I'm not sure how I'm supposed

34:14.482 --> 34:16.548
to feel about that.
What does it signify?

34:16.583 --> 34:18.649
That you run a clean program?
Don't overthink it.

34:23.854 --> 34:25.425
I've been waking up a lot

34:25.460 --> 34:27.559
in the middle
of the night lately.

34:27.594 --> 34:29.165
It's not fun.

34:29.834 --> 34:33.103
Normally, I just go for a run,
but... last night,

34:33.138 --> 34:36.766
I just laid in bed, staring
at the ceiling for hours,

34:36.801 --> 34:38.735
doing math, of all things.

34:39.437 --> 34:41.672
Factoring in
our survival numbers,

34:41.707 --> 34:44.378
billings, pro rating
by time period...

34:44.413 --> 34:46.446
Sounds painful.

34:46.481 --> 34:49.152
It was more painful when
I realized what I was doing.

34:49.187 --> 34:50.813
Which was?

34:50.848 --> 34:55.323
Trying to figure out
what a day of life is worth.

34:58.229 --> 35:01.296
It's always been
about maximizing assets, Jordan.

35:01.331 --> 35:04.563
Unfortunately, the assets
happen to be human organs.

35:06.237 --> 35:07.830
You don't sound much
like a priest.

35:07.865 --> 35:10.305
Ha. And you don't sound
much like a doctor.

35:20.218 --> 35:22.383
Let's just hope that Boxer
has cracked it.

35:22.418 --> 35:24.451
Then we can get back
to our real jobs, eh?

35:24.486 --> 35:26.717
-Yeah.
-Have you spoken to him?

35:26.752 --> 35:29.159
I'm curious as to why
he hasn't listed himself.

35:29.194 --> 35:33.427
No... wait,
why would he list himself?

35:37.301 --> 35:38.894
Charlie?

35:41.371 --> 35:42.766
Rumor has it...

35:43.868 --> 35:46.374
He's got a bad heart.

35:59.257 --> 36:01.224
Marambaia topaz,

36:01.259 --> 36:03.622
the finest topaz
in the world--

36:04.988 --> 36:06.460
Huh.

36:08.695 --> 36:10.695
There's some Zabar's
in the fridge.

36:10.730 --> 36:13.500
Thanks for
helping out, Mom.

36:13.535 --> 36:15.799
I missed
the Save Venice benefit.

36:15.834 --> 36:19.242
Why is it that Rosa gets sick
every time I have a party?

36:19.277 --> 36:21.376
I don't know.
Maybe it's a conspiracy.

36:21.411 --> 36:23.873
Or maybe it's because
you have a party every night?

36:24.809 --> 36:28.944
Mommy? Will I get more
handsome if I kiss a princess?

36:31.751 --> 36:34.884
We watched
"Beauty and the Beast".

36:34.919 --> 36:37.293
He was quite taken with it.

36:37.328 --> 36:39.625
Do you know a princess?

36:41.596 --> 36:44.300
Come here, my little monster.

36:46.704 --> 36:48.799
Can I sleep
in your bed, Mommy?

36:48.834 --> 36:50.669
Are you really gonna sleep?

36:50.704 --> 36:53.243
Or are you gonna just
kick me all night?

36:53.278 --> 36:54.970
Sleep.
- Okay.

36:59.911 --> 37:05.354
Our third match
for the heart is Janet Pike,

37:05.389 --> 37:06.883
who's been on the waiting list

37:06.918 --> 37:09.853
since we classified
her 1-A three weeks ago.

37:09.888 --> 37:12.592
Like Walter Curtis,
it wasn't unanimous...

37:13.892 --> 37:15.826
Its thighs and wings

37:15.861 --> 37:17.927
are USDA-inspected
by the US Department of what?

37:17.962 --> 37:19.533
Agriculture!

37:19.568 --> 37:20.897
Camille?
- Agriculture!

37:20.932 --> 37:22.437
Is correct!

37:24.067 --> 37:26.771
Positives: Janet's 59.
Solid insurance.

37:26.806 --> 37:28.938
She inherited a lot
of money from her husband,

37:28.973 --> 37:31.446
who died on 9/11.
Cantor Fitzgerald.

37:31.481 --> 37:34.515
"I'll flip my lid if you know
what round brimless hat--"

37:34.550 --> 37:36.044
Time for
your meds, Janet.

37:36.079 --> 37:38.816
Take a hike,
I'm watchin' my show!

37:38.851 --> 37:40.719
-Pillbox!
- Pillbox!

37:40.754 --> 37:44.756
Is correct!
-Negatives: I'm single.

37:44.791 --> 37:48.364
I don't have children
or any other family.

37:48.399 --> 37:51.499
I haven't worked
since my husband passed away.

37:51.534 --> 37:54.964
On paper, she doesn't have
an established support system.

37:55.766 --> 37:57.835
I'm fine with Janet
getting this heart,

37:57.870 --> 38:00.838
assuming that it's between
her and Walter Curtis.

38:00.873 --> 38:02.609
I'm on board with that.

38:02.644 --> 38:04.743
Why, 'cause she passed
her wallet autopsy?

38:04.778 --> 38:06.976
-Have you read my reports?
-Yes, I have.

38:07.011 --> 38:08.945
And I've examined her myself.

38:08.980 --> 38:11.684
It's not financial.
Janet's healthier than Walter.

38:11.719 --> 38:14.720
She has a better shot
of sustaining post-op,

38:14.755 --> 38:16.920
even without
the support system.

38:16.955 --> 38:19.428
Well, she's demanding
and impatient with the nurses.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.924
In other words, she's a bitch.

38:20.959 --> 38:22.860
Wow, that's insightful.

38:22.895 --> 38:24.598
The sort of analytical
thinking that's about

38:24.633 --> 38:25.962
to submarine this program.

38:25.997 --> 38:27.667
Here's a fact for you:

38:27.702 --> 38:29.570
Janet's ambivalent
about a transplant.

38:29.605 --> 38:31.066
The idea of having
someone else's heart

38:31.101 --> 38:32.837
in her body
is disturbing to her.

38:32.872 --> 38:34.410
Yet she still listed.

38:34.445 --> 38:35.807
You want Walter
to have the heart.

38:35.842 --> 38:37.347
I told you, I'm abstaining.

38:37.382 --> 38:38.909
You have to vote on this.

38:38.944 --> 38:40.812
We are not classifying.
What is the conflict?

38:42.145 --> 38:45.421
Nine years ago,
Walter tried to commit suicide.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.082
He ingested
a bottle of Percocet.

38:49.691 --> 38:51.889
Jesus. And you cleared him
after that?

38:51.924 --> 38:53.957
He was diagnosed Bipolar.

38:53.992 --> 38:56.663
He started on Lithium, and
he's been stable ever since.

38:56.698 --> 38:59.699
I didn't think he was
a suicide risk any longer.

38:59.734 --> 39:01.932
So, what's the problem?
Why can't you vote?

39:10.448 --> 39:14.351
I lost my daughter
five months ago. She overdosed.

39:18.687 --> 39:19.983
I'm so sorry.

39:20.618 --> 39:23.393
Point is,
I can't evaluate Walter fairly.

39:27.432 --> 39:29.465
I think the suicide is
a disqualifier.

39:30.501 --> 39:32.831
Besides, there's so many
other issues with this patient.

39:33.533 --> 39:35.537
Can I ask you
something, Dr. Boxer?

39:35.572 --> 39:37.132
Aren't these decisions
supposed to be made

39:37.167 --> 39:38.969
on pragmatic, medical grounds?

39:39.004 --> 39:42.038
They are.
-So... who are you to judge?

39:42.073 --> 39:44.106
You can't possibly understand
what Walter was going through.

39:44.141 --> 39:46.614
I'd say an attempted
suicide is pretty relevant

39:46.649 --> 39:48.715
to a character evaluation,
wouldn't you?

39:48.750 --> 39:50.783
Who knows? Evaluating someone's
true character--

39:50.818 --> 39:54.457
or soul, if you will-- seems
like a risky proposition to me.

39:54.492 --> 39:56.558
It's like waving a welcome mat
to a Jehovah's Witness.

39:56.593 --> 39:58.120
Father,
this is standard.

39:58.155 --> 40:00.155
Yeah, but it doesn't
change the fact

40:00.190 --> 40:02.058
that you're making decisions
based on personal perception.

40:02.093 --> 40:03.664
He's not on the stand.

40:03.699 --> 40:05.127
He might be.
You all might be.

40:05.162 --> 40:07.063
If you make choices
based on anything

40:07.098 --> 40:09.131
that can't be quantified,
you're playing God.

40:10.068 --> 40:11.606
I'll be first to step aside

40:11.641 --> 40:13.069
when God walks in here
and votes.

40:13.838 --> 40:15.841
In ten years,
I haven't seen Him yet.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.714
I'm sorry to hear that.

40:20.749 --> 40:22.914
And I'm sure the board
would be sorry to hear

40:22.949 --> 40:24.817
you're supporting anyone
other than Trip Granger.

40:24.852 --> 40:26.720
I'm not supporting anyone,
Dr. Boxer.

40:29.219 --> 40:30.922
It's Pope.

40:30.957 --> 40:32.891
Trip Granger's drug test
results are ready.

40:32.926 --> 40:37.126
Thank you. Bring them up,
and we'll make a decision.

40:37.161 --> 40:38.897
Let's reconvene in ten.

41:01.988 --> 41:04.461
Boxer, we're ready for you.

41:06.091 --> 41:07.761
Uh, give me ten.

41:30.247 --> 41:32.522
Release
the perinephric fat.

41:40.158 --> 41:43.764
Okay, kidney out.

41:48.199 --> 41:49.803
Scalpel.

41:58.583 --> 42:00.649
Shit.

42:00.684 --> 42:02.112
Boxer, you okay?

42:02.147 --> 42:04.752
I'm fine.

42:07.658 --> 42:09.559
I'm fine.

42:45.795 --> 42:47.322
Good job out there, Pope.

42:47.357 --> 42:48.961
You almost fucked it up.

42:50.767 --> 42:52.195
That's the last time
you operate.

42:53.264 --> 42:55.099
I'll be the judge of that.

42:55.134 --> 42:56.364
You need
to disclose your illness

42:56.399 --> 42:57.838
and name a successor.

42:57.873 --> 42:59.169
I don't need to do shit.

43:00.843 --> 43:05.813
Boxer. Those people out there?
They've bled for this.

43:05.848 --> 43:08.079
Not to mention the investors,
who have a right to know

43:08.114 --> 43:10.279
-where their money's going!
-There are no investors.

43:11.315 --> 43:13.084
Granger pulled out?

43:13.119 --> 43:16.054
Not officially.

43:16.089 --> 43:18.089
Found out about my condition.
