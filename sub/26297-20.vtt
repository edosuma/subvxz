WEBVTT

00:01.958 --> 00:05.657
ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s,
before we had the Internet

00:05.701 --> 00:07.398
to diagnose all of our illnesses, we had my mom.

00:07.442 --> 00:08.660
That's right.
Before there was WebMD,

00:08.704 --> 00:10.880
we had BevMD.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.099
My neck is killing me.

00:12.142 --> 00:13.665
I must've
slept on it funny.

00:13.709 --> 00:16.233
What's that? Neck pain?
Can you look down?Yeah, I guess.

00:16.277 --> 00:17.843
You guess?

00:17.887 --> 00:19.889
We're going to the doctor.
It's definitely meningitis.

00:19.932 --> 00:21.456
It's not meningitis!

00:21.499 --> 00:23.327
You know who else didn't think
they had meningitis?

00:23.371 --> 00:25.068
Your cousin Gerald.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.243
Then it ate
through his spine,

00:26.287 --> 00:28.202
and now he's just
a human jellyfish

00:28.245 --> 00:29.768
they have to carry around
in a bucket!

00:29.812 --> 00:31.770
Walk away from me.
Let me see how you walk.

00:31.814 --> 00:34.034
Your gait's uneven.
We're going to the doctor!

00:34.077 --> 00:36.688
ADULT ADAM:
And while my mother
overreacted to everything,

00:36.732 --> 00:38.125
my dad didn't react at all.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.300
Dad?

00:39.343 --> 00:41.650
I fell off the tree
trying to get my boomerang,

00:41.693 --> 00:42.912
and this happened.

00:42.955 --> 00:44.218
Just don't pick at it.
You'll be fine.

00:44.261 --> 00:46.002
Yes!
I'm going back out!

00:46.046 --> 00:47.525
Oh! Ow!

00:47.569 --> 00:49.266
ADULT ADAM: But the worst
was when you'd get caught

00:49.310 --> 00:51.225
between
their medical philosophies.

00:51.268 --> 00:52.574
Dad, does this look normal?

00:52.617 --> 00:55.229
Considering you're a greasy,
oily teen with a zit? Yes.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.666
No! That is a spider bite.

00:57.709 --> 01:00.451
My nail girl
Janae's middle son
thought he had a zit,

01:00.495 --> 01:02.540
but it was actually
a black widow injection point.

01:02.584 --> 01:03.715
Next thing he knew,

01:03.759 --> 01:07.197
about 100 newborn spiders
emerged from his fleshy cheek.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.504
I don't like the spider eggs
in my face, Mama!

01:09.547 --> 01:11.506
Murray, start the car.
We're going to the E.R.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.160
Yeah, it's a zit.
I'm not doing that.

01:13.203 --> 01:14.596
Mama's got you, baby!

01:16.076 --> 01:17.729
I don't want
the spiders!

01:18.730 --> 01:20.297
♪ I'm twisted up inside

01:20.341 --> 01:23.561
♪ But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

01:26.347 --> 01:27.826
♪ I don't know the future

01:27.870 --> 01:31.003
♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪

01:31.047 --> 01:32.962
ADULT ADAM: It was April 3rd, 1980-something,

01:33.005 --> 01:34.790
and my sister's
stalled music career

01:34.833 --> 01:35.965
was about to get a boost.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.619
Guys, I have insane news!

01:37.662 --> 01:39.621
We just got
the gig of a lifetime.

01:39.664 --> 01:41.840
We're playing The Philadelphia
freakin' Spectrum!

01:41.884 --> 01:43.233
The Spectrum?

01:43.277 --> 01:44.626
The Flyers Wives
have this charity

01:44.669 --> 01:45.975
where they throw
a whole carnival.

01:46.018 --> 01:47.324
And we got picked

01:47.368 --> 01:49.761
to be the local band
to perform live on stage.

01:49.805 --> 01:50.849
How did this even happen?

01:50.893 --> 01:52.199
Word of mouth, obviously.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.852
For sure. Also,
I submitted a demo.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.245
Oh, my God, Geoff.

01:55.289 --> 01:56.942
You are seriously
the most amazing

01:56.986 --> 01:58.944
boyfriend/band manager ever.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.642
Me, manager? Really?

02:00.685 --> 02:02.644
You got us
our big break, Geoff.
You've totally earned it.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.211
Sweet! If there's
one thing I know,

02:04.254 --> 02:05.951
managing my hot-tempered
girlfriend's band

02:05.995 --> 02:07.214
could only end well.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.738
Problem. This letter's
for you and Lainey.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.870
Yeah, I submitted their demo
six months ago.

02:11.914 --> 02:15.004
So now they're only getting
two-thirds of the band
they want?

02:15.047 --> 02:16.745
You suck, and you're fired!

02:16.788 --> 02:18.399
Oh, no! This didn't
end well at all!

02:18.442 --> 02:19.661
We are so boned!

02:19.704 --> 02:22.011
There's no way they'll ever
want us to perform now.

02:22.054 --> 02:25.057
Like, why not?
We still totally rock it hard
without Lainey.

02:25.101 --> 02:27.147
It's true. The Dropouts
still got the goods.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.626
I demand you go for it!

02:28.670 --> 02:31.890
Damn it. Our old but re-hired
band manager is right.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.893
Our rocket ride
to superstardom
begins now.

02:34.937 --> 02:38.506
You know,
I've been dabbling a bit
in documentary filmmaking.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.551
Maybe I can make
a rockumentary
about you guys,

02:40.595 --> 02:41.683
like U2's
Rattle and Hum.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.032
No way, nerd.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.468
Oh, wait. Sorry.
Force of habit.

02:44.512 --> 02:45.774
Yes.
For real?

02:45.817 --> 02:47.645
Our fans will for sure
want to know
how it all started.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.821
Sweet! You get to perform
for carnies

02:49.865 --> 02:50.953
and the Flyers'
romantic partners,

02:50.996 --> 02:52.128
and I get to film it.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.261
I heard "Flyers"
and "carnies."

02:54.304 --> 02:56.045
I must be a part
of whatever this is.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.568
They got a real gig
playing The Spectrum.

02:57.612 --> 03:00.310
No, it's none of his business.
Just butt out, dude.

03:00.354 --> 03:03.139
Come on! We both know
you need my fresh rhymes.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.489
Your garbage rap
has no place in a rock band.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.926
So what about when Aerosmith
combined their rock

03:07.970 --> 03:10.364
with the sick rap stylings
of Run-DMC?

03:10.407 --> 03:12.192
Doesn't matter!
You're not even in the band.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.454
Oh, I'm in the band!

03:13.497 --> 03:15.282
No, you're not.
I'm in the band.

03:15.325 --> 03:16.935
No, you're not!
Stop saying it!

03:16.979 --> 03:18.241
Saying what?
You're in the band.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.461
She said it!
Adam's got it on tape!

03:20.504 --> 03:22.376
It's official!
I'm in the band.

03:22.419 --> 03:25.117
ADULT ADAM:
And so Barry decided
to butt into Erica's life.

03:25.161 --> 03:28.164
Meanwhile, my Dad was facing
the decision of a lifetime.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.861
What form you like
your pretzels in, Mur?

03:29.905 --> 03:31.036
Rods or twists?

03:31.080 --> 03:32.516
Really?

03:32.560 --> 03:34.388
It's gotten to the point
where you're so lazy,

03:34.431 --> 03:35.824
even Bill
has to get your snacks?

03:35.867 --> 03:37.129
Hey, there's nothing lazy

03:37.173 --> 03:39.480
about my robust
gentleman best friend here.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.743
Thank you, Bill!
He just hasn't been able

03:41.786 --> 03:43.266
to use his left arm
for three weeks

03:43.310 --> 03:45.399
because of a searing,
fire-like shoulder pain.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.487
Thank you, Bill!

03:46.530 --> 03:48.445
You what? Why haven't
you said anything?

03:48.489 --> 03:51.274
I just tweaked my shoulder
reaching for the remote wrong.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.797
Don't make a big deal
out of it.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.973
You can't move your arm.
How is that not a big deal?

03:55.017 --> 03:56.061
It's just a tweak!

03:56.105 --> 03:57.628
Or advanced leprosy.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.456
Oh, no!
That's the worst kind!

03:59.500 --> 04:00.762
Don't listen to her, Bill.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.198
You know who else
didn't listen?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.721
Myrna Silvman's nephew.

04:03.765 --> 04:06.289
And the boy had to move
to a Hawaiian island

04:06.333 --> 04:08.378
where there are
no direct flights.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.859
In the end, he was just
an ear and a foot.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.209
Sweet Lord! I don't
want a friend who's just
human odds and ends.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.645
Go to a doctor!

04:14.689 --> 04:16.908
I'm not going to a doctor!
They're scam artists!

04:16.952 --> 04:19.694
Yeah. Looks like you just
tweaked your shoulder.

04:19.737 --> 04:22.262
Damn it! There goes
another 100 bucks
plus parking.

04:22.305 --> 04:23.741
Why don't I set you up
with a sling?

04:23.785 --> 04:25.352
Ugh. Here comes
the upsell.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.876
I'm just so glad you don't
have to move to a leper colony

04:27.919 --> 04:30.182
and turn into an eyeball
and a couple of knuckles.

04:30.226 --> 04:31.749
How long have you had
this mole?

04:31.793 --> 04:33.925
There a problem?
No, it's just
a bit abnormal.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.797
It's probably nothing,

04:35.840 --> 04:37.451
but I'd like to do a biopsy,
just to be safe.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.888
Ah, the
"just-to-be-safe biopsy."

04:39.931 --> 04:41.368
Again with the upsell.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.587
Your insurance covers it.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.981
Head two doors down.
It's not gonna
cost you anything.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.678
Hoo-hoo!
You hear that, Bevy?

04:47.722 --> 04:50.202
This clown's giving away
free biopsies.

04:50.246 --> 04:51.508
Quickly,
show him your blotches.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.118
Murray, this is serious.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.512
I'm fine.
Don't spin out.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.950
Doctor, quick question.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.909
Will he live?
Yup.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.911
Don't sugarcoat it.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.173
Will he live?

05:04.216 --> 05:05.392
Yup.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.784
Have you no bedside manner?

05:06.828 --> 05:07.655
Will he live?

05:08.830 --> 05:09.961
Yup.

05:10.005 --> 05:12.573
ADULT ADAM:
As my paranoid mom spun out,

05:12.616 --> 05:14.836
I was busy

with a laser-hot verse.

05:41.123 --> 05:42.733
I'm gonna kill your face!

05:42.777 --> 05:43.952
Come on, Erica!

05:43.995 --> 05:45.954
Just let me
rock The Spectrum with you.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.303
This is my dream.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.610
Oh, my God. You have
so many stupid dreams.

05:49.653 --> 05:50.785
Why take mine?

05:50.828 --> 05:53.483
But this one encompasses
all of them.

05:53.527 --> 05:56.312
First, I wow the crowd
with my lyrical gymnastics,

05:56.356 --> 05:58.749
thus getting signed
to a major record label.

05:58.793 --> 06:01.012
That's crazy.
Second, I drop the mic,

06:01.056 --> 06:02.797
pick up a hockey stick.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.799
The Flyers Wives
see my hockey skills

06:04.842 --> 06:06.844
and immediately sign me
to their husbands' team.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.019
That's even crazier.

06:08.063 --> 06:09.673
Third,
I drop the hockey stick,

06:09.717 --> 06:11.545
pick up a stethoscope,

06:11.588 --> 06:13.329
save the charity
by curing cancer

06:13.373 --> 06:14.852
right there on the ice!

06:14.896 --> 06:16.376
You will not ruin
my legitimate dream

06:16.419 --> 06:18.029
with your three
ridiculous ones.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.596
You're not
in the band!

06:21.076 --> 06:22.904
Hey!
ERICA: I'm so sick of you!

06:22.947 --> 06:23.905
GEOFF: Oh, no! Okay.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.254
Ow! My ass!

06:25.297 --> 06:26.429
GEOFF: His ass!

06:26.473 --> 06:28.126
Initial thoughts?

06:28.170 --> 06:30.912
Well, I... I'm not
gonna sugarcoat this,
'cause I love you,

06:30.955 --> 06:32.827
but this movie's
complete hazarai.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.045
What's that mean?

06:34.089 --> 06:36.004
Yiddish for
"a flaming pile
of ."

06:36.047 --> 06:37.745
I know!

06:37.788 --> 06:39.486
Erica's band didn't even
get through one song.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.357
If anything,
it's hilarious.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.315
They're like
big-haired bozos

06:43.359 --> 06:45.143
who don't even know
what words mean.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.015
Wait! That's it!

06:47.058 --> 06:49.278
This whole time,
I thought I was making
a serious concert film,

06:49.321 --> 06:51.149
but really, this is
This is Spinal Tap!

06:51.193 --> 06:52.412
What is "Spinal Tap"?

06:52.455 --> 06:55.066
This is
This is Spinal Tap!

06:55.110 --> 06:59.027
Okay, I know I ask this a lot,
but I mean it this time.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.245
What's happening?

07:01.595 --> 07:03.510
It's a mockumentary
about a fictional band.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.294
It's one of
my favorite comedies
of all time.

07:05.337 --> 07:07.035
Look, here's a sketch from TV.

07:07.078 --> 07:08.645
You've got Nigel Tufnel,

07:08.689 --> 07:09.951
David St. Hubbins,

07:09.994 --> 07:11.518
Derek Smalls.

07:11.561 --> 07:14.085
They're such British morons
that their amps go to 11

07:14.129 --> 07:16.131
and they can never
find their way to stage.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.612
Wait. Y... You want
to make fun of Erica?

07:18.655 --> 07:20.831
But your whole movie's
supposed to be

07:20.875 --> 07:22.964
about her rocket ride
to fame.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.270
Does it really matter
whose rocket ride
to fame it is,

07:25.314 --> 07:27.751
as long as someone
gets on the rocket?
Mainly me?

07:27.795 --> 07:29.318
You're very passionate,

07:29.361 --> 07:31.059
so I'll just say,
"Go get 'em!"

07:31.102 --> 07:32.582
Pops is on board!

07:32.626 --> 07:34.279
Thanks for always
being there for me!

07:34.323 --> 07:36.499
I really don't need
to come over so much.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.240
ADULT ADAM:
While I secretly turned
my rockumentary

07:38.283 --> 07:39.850
into a mockumentary...

07:39.894 --> 07:41.417
...my mom
had spilled the secret

07:41.461 --> 07:42.940
about my dad's
suspicious mole.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.681
What?
Hi, Murray.

07:44.725 --> 07:47.118
It's just... so good
to see you up and about.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.772
Uh-huh.
Thought you might like

07:48.816 --> 07:50.513
a nice homemade
baked ziti tonight.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.601
Okay.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.171
What?

07:56.214 --> 07:57.955
We just want to say
that we're here for you.

07:57.999 --> 07:58.913
Okay.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.307
What?

08:02.351 --> 08:04.309
You are not alone,
Murray Goldberg.

08:04.353 --> 08:05.397
Okay.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.227
What?

08:09.271 --> 08:10.577
We know about
that suspicious mole!

08:10.620 --> 08:12.883
Bevy!
What is it?
What can I do?

08:12.927 --> 08:14.581
They know!
They're giving me
free stuff!

08:14.624 --> 08:16.931
I told you dumb cows
not to say anything.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.715
And thank you all
for the thoughtful dish.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.631
I told you
it's not a big deal.

08:21.675 --> 08:24.155
But then you go and blab it
to your mob of yentas?

08:24.199 --> 08:25.505
I had to, Murray.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.376
This way,
they'll lay awake all night

08:27.419 --> 08:29.465
full of panic and misery,
just like me.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.336
It's the whole point
of friendship.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.208
Fine, as long as you didn't
tell anybody else.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.078
No one. I promise.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.822
There's my angel
on Earth.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.563
I might've mentioned it
to one other person.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.739
Don't you worry, pal.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.350
I'll marry Bev
and raise your kids as my own.

08:47.744 --> 08:50.225
ADULT ADAM:
After realizing my sister's
band was ridiculous,

08:50.268 --> 08:51.922
I became Marty DiBergi

08:51.966 --> 08:53.837
and would direct
my own version
ofSpinal Tap.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.536
So, this is where
the magic happens, huh?

08:56.579 --> 08:59.147
Oh, yeah.
I find inspiration everywhere.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.715
This week, I'm really inspired
by women being empowered.

09:01.758 --> 09:04.195
I mean, take someone
like Gloria Tubman.

09:04.239 --> 09:06.371
She discovered
the Underground Railroad

09:06.415 --> 09:08.330
and was
the first lady to vote.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.245
She's my muse,
which is why we dedicated

09:10.288 --> 09:11.855
our first cassingle
to her memory.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.075
It's called Don't be Jealous Cuz I'm Hot.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.903
ADAM: So, how long
have you been drumming for?

09:15.946 --> 09:18.209
Actually, I'm pretty new
to the drums.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.907
But when I started,

09:19.950 --> 09:22.257
it was like I'd been
drumming my whole life

09:22.866 --> 09:24.346
in here.

09:24.389 --> 09:25.869
Ba-boom.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.175
Ba-boom.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.874
Ba-boom, boom, boom-boom,
boom... boom.

09:30.918 --> 09:33.398
I have an irregular heartbeat.

09:33.442 --> 09:35.705
Welcome to my musical lair.

09:37.359 --> 09:40.014
Got my many trophies
over here.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.713
Check it!
Personal kara-te dojo.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.236
All my sweat gear.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.065
Wristbands, headbands,
towels...

09:48.109 --> 09:49.197
Soaks it all up.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.460
This is my home studio.

09:51.503 --> 09:54.028
I got a list of words
that rhyme with other words.

09:54.071 --> 09:57.684
Cat, bat, hat,
mat, rat...

09:57.727 --> 09:58.989
Dude, why do you
keep filming him?

09:59.033 --> 10:00.251
He's not even
in the band!

10:00.295 --> 10:01.601
Yeah,
I'm in the band!

10:01.644 --> 10:03.298
You're not in the band!

10:03.341 --> 10:04.691
You're not in the band!

10:04.734 --> 10:05.909
Get out of here!

10:05.953 --> 10:07.041
You suck!

10:09.696 --> 10:10.871
I'm in the band.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.394
ADAM: So, how'd you guys
get your name?

10:12.437 --> 10:15.005
Our band name? Oh, man,
that's a crazy story.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.007
See, we're called
The Dropouts because

10:17.051 --> 10:19.140
we dropped out
of college.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.794
When you hear it
out loud,

10:20.837 --> 10:22.665
it's not really crazy
or a story.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.668
I'm their manager.
Rock 'n' roll!

10:26.451 --> 10:27.844
Danish butter cookie?

10:27.888 --> 10:29.933
But that's your special tin.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.543
It's the least I can do.

10:31.587 --> 10:35.025
I mean, this year's
been so hard.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.505
No one in this family
has taken me seriously

10:36.548 --> 10:38.594
except for you.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.770
I don't know where I would be
without your support.

10:40.814 --> 10:43.468
I mean, you're making
a whole movie just for me.

10:44.121 --> 10:46.863
Ohh, wow!

10:46.907 --> 10:48.822
Ch... Ch... Chad,
maybe you should cut?

10:48.865 --> 10:50.911
No, no, no, no,
I want this all on tape.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.915
I love you, little buddy.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.394
I'm sorry.
I need a sec.

10:56.438 --> 10:57.918
ADAM: Oh, balls!

10:57.961 --> 10:59.833
Okay, this is
no longer Spinal Tap.

10:59.876 --> 11:02.836
We are back to being a serious
rockumentary. Understand?

11:02.879 --> 11:05.055
This is no longer funny
in any way.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.317
Oh, ge...

11:09.277 --> 11:11.975
I just made 1,000 concert
T-shirts to sell at our gig.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.194
Check it.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.412
Who's Big Testy?

11:15.979 --> 11:17.328
Oh, no.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.766
It implies I have
oversized private parts!

11:19.809 --> 11:21.071
Oh, wait.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.290
Nice!

11:23.944 --> 11:26.250
Not a comedy.
Serious stuff.

11:26.294 --> 11:27.948
ADULT ADAM:
While I was bailing
on my mockumentary,

11:27.991 --> 11:30.559
my dad was cheering himself up with a day in the sun.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.517
Going to the Phillies game.
See you later.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.432
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:34.476 --> 11:37.087
You want to bake in the stands
in an open baseball stadium

11:37.131 --> 11:39.481
like a Wawa hot dog
for hours on end?

11:39.524 --> 11:40.874
You mean live my life? Yeah.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.440
Bevy, let the man
have a little fun

11:42.484 --> 11:44.138
before he lays down
his burden

11:44.181 --> 11:46.357
and crosses beyond the veil.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.577
Bill, no one knows
what you're saying.
Go wait in the car.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.144
It's fine.
Go see the Phillies.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.799
All I ask is you take
a few tiny precautions

11:52.842 --> 11:54.365
to protect yourself
from the sun.

11:54.409 --> 11:55.845
Let's get this over with.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.195
Is that you, Mur?

11:58.239 --> 12:01.938
It is him,
underneath three layers
of SPF-500 sunblock,

12:01.982 --> 12:03.679
opera-length ski gloves,

12:03.723 --> 12:06.116
my gardening hat,
zinc for the nose,

12:06.160 --> 12:07.335
fetching neckerchief,

12:07.378 --> 12:08.945
and BluBlocker sunglasses.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.514
In case it's not clear,
I'm not going to the game.

12:12.557 --> 12:13.994
Don't worry, buddy.

12:14.037 --> 12:16.344
Just a regular-season game.
Not gonna miss a thing.

12:16.387 --> 12:19.086
Phillies great
Mike Schmidt stunned
the baseball world today

12:19.129 --> 12:20.914
with his surprise
retirement announcement

12:20.957 --> 12:22.437
before tonight's game.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.569
18 years ago,
I left Dayton, Ohio,

12:24.613 --> 12:27.877
with a dream to become a major-league baseball player.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.662
I thank God
that dream came true.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.100
You made me miss
Mike Schmidt's last game.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.492
Was he good?

12:34.536 --> 12:37.060
Only the greatest Phillie
of all time!

12:37.104 --> 12:38.453
Well, maybe
he'll change his mind

12:38.496 --> 12:39.715
and play
more baseball games.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.151
Leave me be.
Got it.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.458
ADULT ADAM: My dad wouldnever get over missing that game.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.981
Meanwhile,
The Dropouts had arrived

12:45.025 --> 12:46.766
at the city's
biggest charity event.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.071
Okay, guys,
we're rolling.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.204
All right, time to finish
this very legitimate,

12:50.247 --> 12:51.379
non-ironic documentary.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.033
Everyone feeling okay?

12:53.076 --> 12:54.730
Not at all. There's
so many people down there.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.298
Dude, you're our manager!
Your job is to calm us down!

12:57.341 --> 12:59.735
I want to,
but did you see the crowd?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.737
If you're not super nervous,
you really should be.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.608
This is, like,
a total nightmare.

13:03.652 --> 13:06.611
They even got hockey legend
Bobby Clarke in the dunk tank!

13:06.655 --> 13:08.265
I'm so glad
I'm not in this band

13:08.309 --> 13:09.745
and don't have
to sing for him.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.051
What do you mean
you're not in the band?

13:11.094 --> 13:12.879
You made it very clear
that you were!

13:12.922 --> 13:14.663
I never once said that!
All right?

13:14.706 --> 13:16.099
Tell 'em,
manager Geoff!

13:16.143 --> 13:17.884
I can't! It's too much!
I quit!

13:17.927 --> 13:20.060
Oh, no!
We just lost our manager!

13:20.103 --> 13:21.670
He's, like, the backbone
of this whole operation!

13:21.713 --> 13:24.542
Okay! Everyone, calm down!

13:24.586 --> 13:27.632
Erica, you said
me supporting you
means everything, right?

13:27.676 --> 13:29.069
So hear me now.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.897
You were born
to do this!

13:30.940 --> 13:32.289
What about me?

13:32.333 --> 13:33.813
You were born, too.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.075
Was I born?

13:35.118 --> 13:37.120
Yes, everyone here
was born!

13:37.164 --> 13:39.688
Okay, just go out there
and sing your heart out

13:39.731 --> 13:41.516
so I can get
some awesome footage

13:41.559 --> 13:44.562
for my very real,
non-comedic documentary.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.477
Adam's right.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.479
We got this, guys!
Rock 'n' roll!

13:48.523 --> 13:50.046
Rock 'n' roll, baby!

13:50.090 --> 13:51.656
Also, I'm back in the band!

13:51.700 --> 13:53.789
Whoo!
Rock 'n' roll, baby!

13:53.833 --> 13:55.138
Whoo!

13:55.182 --> 13:56.444
ERICA AND VALLEY ERICA: Yeah!

13:56.487 --> 13:58.794
Rock 'n' roll, baby!

13:58.838 --> 14:00.274
Rock 'n' roll!
Let's go!

14:00.317 --> 14:01.449
Rock 'n' roll!

14:01.492 --> 14:02.798
Oh.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.756
Oh. Must be
the, uh, other way.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.975
Rock 'n' roll
this way!

14:06.019 --> 14:07.324
Rock 'n' roll! Yeah!

14:07.368 --> 14:08.412
Rock 'n' roll!

14:09.370 --> 14:10.632
Ow!

14:10.675 --> 14:13.069
Rock 'n' roll, baby.
ERICA: Rock 'n' roll!
Whoo!

14:13.113 --> 14:14.244
VALLEY ERICA: Rock 'n' roll!

14:14.288 --> 14:15.898
All right.
ERICA: Whoo-hoo!

14:15.942 --> 14:17.813
Hey. Uh, we're looking
for the stage.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.076
Oh, you go
down that way,

14:20.120 --> 14:22.731
turn left, then left,
and go straight up the ramp.

14:22.774 --> 14:23.601
There's your stage.
All right.

14:23.645 --> 14:24.994
Rock n' roll!

14:25.038 --> 14:26.256
BARRY: Rock n' roll.
ERICA: Rock n' roll.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.388
VALLEY ERICA: Whoo!

14:27.431 --> 14:28.650
BARRY: Yeah. One more lap.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.304
Whoo!
Rock n' roll!

14:30.347 --> 14:32.132
Rock n' roll!

14:32.654 --> 14:34.177
Damn it!

14:34.221 --> 14:36.005
What the...

14:36.049 --> 14:38.051
How the hell you all
end up back here again?

14:38.094 --> 14:41.315
Oh, my God! You guys
really are Spinal Tap!What?

14:41.358 --> 14:43.099
I'm literally doing
everything I can

14:43.143 --> 14:45.362
to not make this documentary
a complete farce,

14:45.406 --> 14:47.408
but it's impossible
to make you look good!

14:47.451 --> 14:48.975
Wait. That's what
you've been doing?

14:49.018 --> 14:50.802
Making me look
like some kind of joke?

14:50.846 --> 14:53.718
Honestly,
I didn't have to do much.

14:53.762 --> 14:56.069
So much for being
the one person left
who believes in me.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.201
BARRY:  Hey!

14:58.245 --> 15:01.204
I found another place
that's not the stage!

15:01.248 --> 15:03.903
Now please help me down!
I'm so scared!

15:05.252 --> 15:06.688
Hey.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.472
I know you're mad,

15:08.516 --> 15:10.910
but I got you
a little something
that I know will cheer you up.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.652
I went to Carvel,
and I ordered a...

15:14.696 --> 15:15.784
Schmitty-Puss!

15:15.827 --> 15:17.351
A what-a-puss?
Schmitty-Puss.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.179
It's a Cookie-Puss
ice cream cake

15:19.222 --> 15:22.182
with a butterscotch mustache
made special just for you!

15:24.706 --> 15:26.186
You didn't
have to do that.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.101
I already moved on from
the whole Mike Schmidt thing.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.319
Really?
Yeah.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.626
I went back to Dr. Emry
this morning.Without me?

15:31.669 --> 15:33.193
He said it's all good.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.934
After all that, I'm fine.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.892
Oh, poop.
I am so relieved!

15:36.936 --> 15:38.415
You have no idea.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.677
What are we
waiting for, Mur?

15:39.721 --> 15:41.505
Let's go get
our Schmitty-Puss.

15:41.549 --> 15:44.421
I can taste Mike's
butterscotch mustache
right now.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.209
Wow, your neck
is thirsty.

15:49.252 --> 15:52.081
It's really sopping up
all this sunscreen.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.040
Yeah, spread it around good,
like peanut butter.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.171
What the hell's going on?

15:55.215 --> 15:57.347
What? Just doing what
you wanted. Sunscreening up.

15:57.391 --> 15:59.436
Carvel is down the street.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.048
He doesn't need that much goop
to go a couple of blocks.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.049
All right, go ahead
and pop that shirt off.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.615
Don't want those rays
to get through.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.182
No! Don't pop anything off.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.358
What the hell
is happening?Nothing.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.447
Did you talk to the doctor?
What did he say?

16:10.491 --> 16:13.581
Well, the general gist is
he's got a bad mole,

16:13.624 --> 16:16.105
so Mur's gotta go back
and have more
melon balled out.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.064
Wait. You took him
to the doctor instead of me?

16:18.107 --> 16:20.980
I'm his rock.
No, I'm his rock.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.633
Enough!
You are unbelievable.

16:22.677 --> 16:25.201
Your suspicious mole turns out
to be more than suspicious,

16:25.245 --> 16:26.855
and you weren't even
gonna tell me!

16:26.898 --> 16:28.900
I just didn't want you
to go crazy,
like you always do.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.946
What's crazy
about loving my family

16:30.990 --> 16:32.513
and wanting them
to be healthy?

16:32.556 --> 16:34.645
You made Adam think he had
a spider's nest in his face.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.605
You told Erica
that she had
coal miner's lung.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.824
And you convinced Barry
that he had salmonella!

16:39.868 --> 16:41.435
He did have salmonella!

16:41.478 --> 16:43.741
He ate a raw goose egg
that he found in the park.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.700
Fine!
Barry's a moron!

16:45.743 --> 16:48.094
But the last thing
I need right now
is you spinning out.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.225
Of course
I'm spinning out.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.488
You're my husband!
I want to help you!

16:51.532 --> 16:52.663
You can't.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.752
Look, I haven't
taken good care of myself.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.537
But I gotta deal with this
on my own.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.366
Because you,
all you do is make it worse.

17:05.546 --> 17:08.288
ADAM: My mom realized that she had to stop stressing about my dad's health,

17:08.331 --> 17:10.377
so she took a more
laid-back approach.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.293
Hey, hey!
What's the word,
papa bird?

17:13.336 --> 17:16.078
What is this?
It's just me.
Easy-breezy Beverleezy.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.993
What are you
talking about?Oops. I almost forgot.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.995
Doctor E
gave us a ring rang,

17:20.039 --> 17:21.736
little jingle jangle
on the Ma Bell.

17:21.779 --> 17:22.780
What? What are these words?

17:22.824 --> 17:24.347
Doc said you're all set

17:24.391 --> 17:25.957
for your little
snip and stitch manana.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.698
Not that I'm stressin'.
Ya feel me?

17:27.742 --> 17:29.439
Actually not,
but it doesn't matter.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.441
It's just outpatient.
Bill will take me home.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.922
Makes no diff to me.
Cab it, thumb it.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.793
Heck, grab
Big Tasty's skateboard

17:35.837 --> 17:37.360
and shred
all the way home, brah.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.927
Did you say "brah"?

17:38.970 --> 17:40.189
Did you get hit in the head?
What's wrong with you?

17:40.233 --> 17:41.756
Nothing!

17:41.799 --> 17:43.801
Frankie says "Relax"!

17:43.845 --> 17:45.064
Where's the beef?

17:45.107 --> 17:46.891
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.458
Oy vey,Murray!

17:48.502 --> 17:51.461
Beverly's loudmouth yentas
just told me about

17:51.505 --> 17:52.723
the mole.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.812
You're harshin'
everyone's vibe, Daddy-o.

17:54.856 --> 17:57.380
The only mole we talk about
in this house is guaca-mole.

17:57.424 --> 18:00.122
Why is she speaking
in jive and Spanish?

18:00.166 --> 18:02.037
I told her
that she makes us crazy

18:02.081 --> 18:03.299
with her constant worrying.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.432
That, you do.
Okay, fine!

18:05.475 --> 18:07.782
I love this family so much,
I worry myself sick.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.088
That, she does.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.394
But there's one thing
I'm even better
at than worrying

18:11.438 --> 18:12.743
when it comes
to my family,

18:12.787 --> 18:14.310
and that's kicking ass.

18:14.354 --> 18:15.398
That, you do.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.139
So I'm not gonna
worry about this anymore,

18:17.183 --> 18:18.662
and neither are you,

18:18.706 --> 18:21.709
because I refuse
to let anything
bad happen to you.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.232
Understand?

18:23.276 --> 18:25.365
But if I'm gonna change,
then so will you.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.106
No more ignoring doctors

18:27.149 --> 18:28.803
and not taking care
of yourself.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.935
You're gonna eat right,
wear sunscreen...

18:32.241 --> 18:34.504
And take a damn walk with me
once in a while.

18:34.548 --> 18:35.244
Got it?

18:38.334 --> 18:40.945
That is why
you're my rock.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.643
I always will be.

18:42.686 --> 18:45.559
ADAM: Turns out my dad was just as scared as my mom.

18:45.602 --> 18:48.214
But with her help, he was ready to face anything.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.607
As for Erica,
she was ready to bail.

18:50.651 --> 18:51.869
Here. It's a map
to the stage.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.001
You're gonna need it.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.785
We all agree
you got this.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.004
Go away.

18:56.047 --> 18:58.180
I'm not going out there.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.790
You were right.
We're a joke.

18:59.834 --> 19:00.878
It's my fault.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.402
You only think that
'cause of my mean video.

19:02.445 --> 19:03.968
It's no one's fault.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.232
'Cause this whole
music dream of mine,

19:06.275 --> 19:07.363
it's just
not happening.

19:07.407 --> 19:08.756
Well, you may not
believe in yourself,

19:08.799 --> 19:10.192
but you were right.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.672
I really do
believe in you.

19:11.715 --> 19:14.153
And I know you can rock
the hell out of that crowd.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.764
Truth is, you don't even need
my sick rhymes.

19:16.807 --> 19:17.982
You'll do great
on your own.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.636
Although...

19:19.680 --> 19:21.812
I would do a lot better
if you were out there with me.

19:21.856 --> 19:25.555
Even Aerosmith
needs a little Run-DMC
every once in a while.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.383
So what do you say
we forget about my stupid song

19:27.427 --> 19:28.950
and do a real one?

19:28.993 --> 19:30.560
Normally,
documentary filmmakers

19:30.604 --> 19:32.214
aren't supposed
to get involved
with their subjects,

19:32.258 --> 19:33.346
but screw it!

19:33.389 --> 19:35.130
ADAM: And so Erica and Barry

19:35.174 --> 19:37.001
got a taste
of their musical dreams

19:37.045 --> 19:40.091
by joining forces to show
everyone in The Spectrum

19:40.135 --> 19:41.876

ADAM: Life is a funny thing.

20:16.171 --> 20:18.129
That year,
my dad's big health scare

20:18.173 --> 20:19.566
would change him forever.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.872
But the one thing
that always stayed the same

20:21.916 --> 20:24.614
was that my mom
would be right by his side.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.529
As for The Dropouts,
playing The Spectrum

20:26.573 --> 20:28.270
wouldn't just be
their best performance.

20:28.314 --> 20:29.880
It'd be their last.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.360
'Cause as important as it was

20:31.404 --> 20:33.536
for Erica to achieve
her musical dreams,

20:33.580 --> 20:35.669
she realized
it was more important

20:35.712 --> 20:37.279
to go out on top.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.555
'Sup, cheerleaders?
You may have heard

20:52.599 --> 20:54.427
about my gig
at The Spectrum
last night.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.080
It's huge news.
People are talking.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.344
Anyway, I am
back on the market.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.910
And with graduation
coming up,

20:59.954 --> 21:02.435
time is running out
to score a date
with Big Tasty.

21:02.478 --> 21:05.133
Who is that?
You're funny.
I like that.

21:05.176 --> 21:06.177
How do you feel
about Olive Garden?

21:06.221 --> 21:07.309
Sorry.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.006
It's a "no".
'Cause of Lainey.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.313
You know Lainey?
All cheerleaders
have a strict code.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.575
Ex-boyfriends
are off-limits.

21:12.619 --> 21:15.099
Your loyalty
is very refreshing.Thank you.

21:15.143 --> 21:16.579
And in the spirit
of honesty,

21:16.623 --> 21:18.668
I really didn't
want you to say yes,

21:18.712 --> 21:20.235
'cause I'm not
over Lainey.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.584
I'm only here
to impress the jocks.

21:21.628 --> 21:23.282
They said yes!
No. They didn't.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.370
Also, we don't care.

21:24.413 --> 21:25.980
Well, have a nice day,
cheerleaders.
