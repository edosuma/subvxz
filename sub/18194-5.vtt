00:00.033 --> 00:01.492
<i>Previously on</i> The Royals...

00:01.640 --> 00:03.851
Simon is your biological father.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.804
- I need you to believe in me now.
- I do.

00:05.884 --> 00:07.639
You're ready to be king.

00:09.156 --> 00:10.305
Robby?

00:10.351 --> 00:14.421
That man wouldn't let doctors'
results, or Helena or cancer

00:14.553 --> 00:16.928
get in the way of
what he wanted!

00:17.125 --> 00:19.843
Where the bloody hell
is that man?

00:20.507 --> 00:21.551
Right here!

00:22.046 --> 00:24.085
Have we ever met? I'm Beck.

00:24.210 --> 00:26.445
Beck was Robert's best friend.

00:26.828 --> 00:29.703
I may have lost
my virginity to him.'

00:30.703 --> 00:33.203
when I think of a Princess
I always think of Eleanor.

00:33.273 --> 00:35.953
That's what Eleanor is.
She's a real Princess.

00:37.828 --> 00:40.109
So I guess you're not
mad at me anymore?

00:40.664 --> 00:42.367
I do what I want

00:42.519 --> 00:45.695
and right now,
I want to do this.

00:46.148 --> 00:48.312
I spent a lot of time
in my brother's shadow

00:48.381 --> 00:50.375
but it wasn't okay
the day I met you.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.242
My heart is a disaster.

00:52.483 --> 00:55.195
My head's even worse,
but I want you.

00:57.519 --> 00:59.152
- K.
- Jesus!

01:00.791 --> 01:02.109
Jesus!

01:04.976 --> 01:08.070
'Welcome to our special coverage
of this historic moment.

01:08.156 --> 01:11.609
I know we are speaking for the entire
country, perhaps even the whole world

01:11.734 --> 01:14.539
when we say
Welcome Home, Prince Robert.'

01:14.640 --> 01:17.093
'Welcome Home,
Prince Robert!'

01:17.195 --> 01:18.757
'Excitement is in the air.'

01:18.882 --> 01:21.007
They're calling him
Prince Lazarus,

01:21.062 --> 01:23.968
saying his return is
a sword in the stone moment.'

01:24.093 --> 01:27.085
Street parties,
Parades! What a week!

01:27.153 --> 01:30.000
And today it's
the royal balcony!

01:30.136 --> 01:32.765
'That's right, history happening
before our eyes

01:32.828 --> 01:35.993
as Prince Robert is publicly
reunited with his family

01:36.062 --> 01:38.398
for the first time
since his return.'

01:39.351 --> 01:41.625
What does it
all mean for King Cyrus?

01:41.750 --> 01:44.085
- Two kings?
- Unprecedented!

01:44.246 --> 01:47.476
How and when will a transition
of power take place?

01:47.553 --> 01:50.030
But there's a more important
question to be answered.'

01:50.085 --> 01:53.964
That's right! What will
the Queen be wearing today?

01:54.066 --> 01:56.261
So many jewels, so little time.

01:56.347 --> 01:59.847
I cannot wait to see how fabulous
she looks on that balcony.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.954
Well, how
the Royals must be feeling

02:03.022 --> 02:05.402
since Prince Robert
came back, I can't imagine.'

02:05.495 --> 02:08.386
Your first-born son.
It's a momentous occasion.

02:08.448 --> 02:11.089
You can be sure that no one in
the palace is resting

Precisely Synchronized by <font color=#00FF00>srjanapala</font>

04:27.734 --> 04:30.267
Every choice we make today has
consequences.

04:30.368 --> 04:32.923
The balcony will be scrutinized
by the press,

04:32.994 --> 04:35.181
the people, the powers that be.

04:35.391 --> 04:38.392
Even a sideways glance
may be misconstrued.

04:38.656 --> 04:41.457
- Or construed.
- Precisely.

04:41.581 --> 04:45.850
So, let's make certain
Cyrus is relegated,

04:45.919 --> 04:49.025
and you, my darling, are front
and center up there.

04:49.118 --> 04:50.861
Though you haven't
been officially crowned,

04:50.970 --> 04:54.137
it will signal
that you are clearly king.

04:54.314 --> 04:57.087
And what will uncle Cyrus
have to say about that?

04:57.251 --> 04:59.954
I'd throw him off the balcony if
I could.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.548
But in lieu of that,

05:02.697 --> 05:04.052
perhaps he would be
gracious enough

05:04.076 --> 05:06.843
to be ill and stay in bed.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.879
Look, I know how much
today means to you,

05:10.072 --> 05:13.314
but Cyrus will insist on being
there... and like you said

05:13.345 --> 05:15.587
we can't be seen jostling
for position in public.

05:15.697 --> 05:17.993
England needs stability, mum.

05:18.290 --> 05:20.618
Then he must clearly
bow to you on the balcony

05:20.673 --> 05:22.720
to signal order of precedence.

05:22.978 --> 05:24.134
Fat chance!

05:24.493 --> 05:26.767
The best case scenario
is that we pre-negotiate

05:26.868 --> 05:28.231
good placement with him.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.699
And try being nice.

05:29.845 --> 05:32.635
He's family, mum.
Dad's only brother, no less.

05:32.837 --> 05:35.939
Not to mention,
his ego is black and blue.

05:36.290 --> 05:38.829
Best handled with delicacy.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.886
- Your favorite.
- Ahh! Hey.

05:49.955 --> 05:52.986
What... what are you...
Doing here?

05:54.712 --> 05:57.954
Officially, I'm here to be your
brother's equerry for the day.

05:58.072 --> 06:00.947
But really?
I've just come to see you.

06:01.243 --> 06:02.709
Ok, hang on.

06:03.290 --> 06:06.314
Your best friend miraculously
rises from the dead

06:06.431 --> 06:08.337
but the only reason
you're here is to see me.

06:08.391 --> 06:10.579
A girl's supposed
to believe that?

06:10.669 --> 06:13.228
- A girl is.
- Okay!

06:13.392 --> 06:14.939
Mm.

06:16.056 --> 06:19.579
Darling, Beckwith the second, my
first love.

06:20.165 --> 06:22.697
I don't think
that you should sort of just

06:22.775 --> 06:25.142
waltz into my bedroom
just 'cause you're in town.

06:25.170 --> 06:26.969
I don't think that
can happen anymore.

06:27.056 --> 06:30.322
How come? It's not like you've
got a boyfriend.

06:32.395 --> 06:33.961
You've got a boyfriend?

06:36.072 --> 06:37.103
Who is he?

06:37.181 --> 06:39.064
None of your business,
Nosey Parker.

06:39.126 --> 06:41.371
- Are you pushing me off?
- Yes!

06:41.493 --> 06:43.640
- But the bacon can stay.
- Uh-uh!

06:45.501 --> 06:48.376
No, no, no.
It's a package deal.

06:49.392 --> 06:51.431
Package deal!

06:52.197 --> 06:54.861
Bacon, extra crispy,

06:54.923 --> 06:57.361
with no presumptuous flirting on
the side, please.

06:57.493 --> 06:59.255
'Right away,
your highness.'

06:59.979 --> 07:01.329
okay.

07:23.315 --> 07:26.088
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:29.773 --> 07:31.838
It's good to see you.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.197
It's how Robert used to signal
that he wants to meet.

07:37.322 --> 07:38.604
A steak?

07:38.744 --> 07:41.268
Meat. Like, "meet"?

07:41.604 --> 07:42.964
Have you responded
to his text yet?

07:43.080 --> 07:44.166
No.

07:44.283 --> 07:45.542
We didn't do anything wrong.

07:45.611 --> 07:47.777
Then why do I feel so nervous?

07:47.839 --> 07:51.808
I'm so worried I'm gonna say the wrong
thing and mess things up between you two.

07:52.049 --> 07:53.977
I don't want to get
between brothers.

07:54.158 --> 07:57.354
I know what we agreed but I keep
asking myself, is it better to lie,

07:57.470 --> 07:59.916
or tell a truth that
could be so destructive?

08:00.017 --> 08:01.432
That's the question.

08:01.511 --> 08:03.310
He's here. He's outside.

08:03.457 --> 08:07.214
- Is he coming up right now?
- No.

08:07.769 --> 08:09.459
He's on his motorbike.

08:09.550 --> 08:11.479
That means he wants to go out.

08:11.768 --> 08:14.297
Well, you should go.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.807
I'm sorry.

08:18.643 --> 08:20.088
I know.

08:50.045 --> 08:52.147
You're the fairest of them all.

08:52.350 --> 08:56.553
Hm... all those little pricks
must be doing you good.

08:56.764 --> 08:58.626
I hope you're feeling
as well as you look.

08:58.764 --> 09:01.748
Those people might actually be
on to something.

09:01.959 --> 09:05.904
Now, to what do I owe the honor
of all these false compliments?

09:06.037 --> 09:07.811
The balcony perchance?

09:07.928 --> 09:10.029
Have you given thought
to who will stand where?

09:10.139 --> 09:13.061
Location. Location. Location.

09:14.084 --> 09:16.350
Come, we both know
it's merely theater.

09:16.404 --> 09:20.592
But the people do enjoy it, and the
economy needs a bit of a prop up.

09:20.678 --> 09:21.920
Indeed.

09:22.092 --> 09:25.586
- Two kings is volatile.
- Exactly.

09:25.709 --> 09:28.779
And given what the day is for
and who people want to see...

09:28.920 --> 09:33.100
You want it to be
all about Prince Lazarus.

09:33.490 --> 09:38.350
You have the chance to make the
balcony your golden opportunity.

09:38.561 --> 09:41.428
Take this moment
and secure your legacy

09:41.514 --> 09:45.928
as the wise steward who held the
royal family together

09:46.006 --> 09:48.717
in the terrible months
after Simon's death

09:48.897 --> 09:51.612
and the return of
the rightful heir.

09:53.764 --> 09:57.733
The only alternative is for you
to be the guy who tried,

09:57.873 --> 10:02.248
and most definitely failed, to
tear this family apart.

10:03.233 --> 10:07.037
Robert should stand
front and center.

10:07.248 --> 10:10.514
I appreciate the Queen's
munificent consultation,

10:10.566 --> 10:13.367
and I thank her for giving the
king a choice.

10:13.436 --> 10:14.768
Cyrus...

10:17.568 --> 10:19.061
No, really.

10:19.279 --> 10:22.459
I see your point.
Robby's great.

10:22.725 --> 10:25.112
And it's the right thing to do.

10:34.381 --> 10:36.705
Hey, bodyguard.

10:37.787 --> 10:40.451
Where's your reply to
my latest amazing letter?

10:41.693 --> 10:44.170
- I've been working on one.
- Yeah?

10:44.194 --> 10:46.037
Yeah. How about...

10:46.077 --> 10:48.757
"Dearest Eleanor, why the hell was
Beck coming out of your bedroom?"

10:49.233 --> 10:53.014
Ha! You mean, what was he doing
getting kicked out of my bedroom?

10:53.147 --> 10:55.428
Either way,
I'm not feeling too inspired.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.678
He's only here for Robert.

10:58.764 --> 11:01.936
Hey, we are jaspenor.

11:02.044 --> 11:03.944
And uh...

11:05.427 --> 11:06.639
Are we good?

11:07.178 --> 11:08.990
I don't know. You tell me.

11:09.147 --> 11:12.545
Well, I told him that
I have a boyfriend.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.232
But if you like, I could
put a lock on my door,

11:15.311 --> 11:18.217
or, uh, I perhaps wear
a chastity belt?

11:18.318 --> 11:21.235
Try explaining that one
to Sara Alice.

11:22.865 --> 11:26.662
Hey. It's me.

11:34.725 --> 11:37.785
Good. I'm glad that's sorted.

11:38.389 --> 11:41.139
Although I am still a little
light on reading material.

11:41.537 --> 11:42.959
How about,

11:43.092 --> 11:46.860
"Dearest Eleanor, I'm sorry
for misinterpreting things."

11:46.929 --> 11:51.207
I can't wait to make it up
to you, over and over again.

11:53.723 --> 11:55.155
"How about tonight?"

11:56.153 --> 11:58.707
I'm feeling a little bit
more inspired now.

11:59.801 --> 12:01.309
Good.

12:14.293 --> 12:16.323
Oh, darling, good.
You can help me decide.

12:16.520 --> 12:21.098
Now, Magenta says, "a Queen
must be seen to be believed."

12:21.277 --> 12:24.254
But, the white says,
"New beginnings."

12:24.559 --> 12:26.989
Yeah, but it also says "virgin".

12:27.473 --> 12:29.676
Fine. The Magenta.

12:31.496 --> 12:36.210
Now, this... is for you to wear on
the balcony today.

12:36.444 --> 12:38.979
You gotta stop dropping acid,
it's becoming a problem.

12:39.048 --> 12:40.514
Years ago,
I wore it on the balcony.

12:40.583 --> 12:43.233
Then it went out of fashion
and that's where it stayed.

12:43.350 --> 12:47.905
It was the day your father and I presented
you to the world for the first time.

12:48.209 --> 12:49.890
And a star was born.

12:51.706 --> 12:52.936
No.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.709
The press will recognize it and it will
symbolize our mother-daughter unity.

12:56.795 --> 12:58.265
They'll write about it
for weeks.

12:58.334 --> 13:02.858
Mum, today is about Robby. It's
not about me or what I'm wearing.

13:02.968 --> 13:04.326
Or you, for that matter.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.701
What's best for Robby
is peace between you and me,

13:07.826 --> 13:09.647
privately and publicly,

13:09.778 --> 13:12.272
which hasn't always
been the case.

13:18.576 --> 13:20.373
I'll try it for size.

13:31.035 --> 13:32.935
So, how have you been, K?

13:34.413 --> 13:36.655
Prince's arms treating you well?

13:37.962 --> 13:40.358
Yeah. Fine.

13:40.944 --> 13:43.144
Keeping me busy.

13:45.553 --> 13:47.921
And are the family well?

13:48.006 --> 13:49.772
Dad's great, thanks.

13:49.858 --> 13:53.795
Angie is...
Well, she's never not Angie.

13:54.905 --> 13:58.389
She's been glued to the TV 24/7
all week.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.647
Must be a whirlwind, Robby.

14:00.764 --> 14:03.819
Everyone in the nation
is thrilled to have you home.

14:04.553 --> 14:07.668
I hope everyone?
Don't fish for compliments.

14:08.006 --> 14:10.237
You never did put me
on a pedestal.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.574
Well, the rest of the world
did that just fine.

14:14.550 --> 14:16.084
I've missed that smile.

14:19.741 --> 14:21.280
You know... It'd be...

14:21.366 --> 14:23.334
Great, if the Prince
could tell his bodyguard

14:23.381 --> 14:24.913
before he's nipping off
to see a girl.

14:24.991 --> 14:26.483
Her ex-boyfriend
is back in town.

14:26.576 --> 14:29.022
I'm sure he's her ex
for a reason.

14:30.366 --> 14:34.157
No? Okay. I gave it a shot, just
like Beck did with len.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.990
I just saw him leaving her bedroom.

14:36.071 --> 14:37.665
He was in her bedroom?

14:38.516 --> 14:39.836
You don't
have to worry about him.

14:39.884 --> 14:42.337
Oh, but you have to worry about
Kathryn's ex?

14:42.915 --> 14:44.626
What, do you want me to
rough him up a bit?

14:44.735 --> 14:46.977
- He's untouchable.
- Try me.

14:47.134 --> 14:51.009
He was her ex,
but they didn't break up.

14:52.402 --> 14:54.469
He died, and then he undied.

14:57.399 --> 14:59.086
Holy shit.

14:59.712 --> 15:00.829
Yeah.

15:00.889 --> 15:04.389
Robert,
an outstanding young man.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.084
He's my favorite nephew

15:06.170 --> 15:08.428
and it's wonderful
to have him home.

15:08.584 --> 15:10.897
And yet, if you continue
to straddle the throne

15:10.966 --> 15:15.678
it's not clear... who is head of
state, church, or the armed forces.

15:15.803 --> 15:18.709
Let me set your minds at ease.

15:19.373 --> 15:22.451
Robert will be a great king.

15:22.756 --> 15:26.279
Someday.
But that day is not today.

15:26.475 --> 15:30.660
For starters,
the kid is legally dead.

15:30.809 --> 15:33.053
'And we're a nation of laws.

15:33.122 --> 15:36.301
Speaking of,
there's this small matter

15:36.387 --> 15:40.043
of a legally-sitting king, I.E.
Me.

15:40.481 --> 15:45.129
Never in the history of this country
has a sitting king been dethroned,

15:45.301 --> 15:47.410
unless it was on
the battlefield.

15:47.551 --> 15:51.793
Well, then,
the battlefield it is.'

15:57.387 --> 15:59.946
would you care to comment, your
majesty?

16:06.785 --> 16:09.145
We had an agreement!

16:09.340 --> 16:10.801
You mean earlier,

16:10.918 --> 16:14.418
when you came into my room barking
orders while I pretended to listen?

16:14.559 --> 16:16.457
Well, woof, woof.

16:16.606 --> 16:18.996
Nobody puts baby in the corner.

16:19.090 --> 16:23.637
It's just a matter of time. You haven't
got a chance of stopping Robert.

16:23.676 --> 16:25.848
Oh, but I do.

16:26.098 --> 16:29.785
Poor lad suffered a nasty bump
when he fell out of the sky,

16:29.949 --> 16:33.223
then suffered solitary
confinement and near starvation.

16:33.395 --> 16:36.442
He might be one sandwich short
of a picnic.

16:36.739 --> 16:39.442
Cyrus, this isn't
what the people want!

16:39.559 --> 16:41.036
They want Robert!

16:41.122 --> 16:43.357
Opinion polls have gone up loads

16:43.425 --> 16:45.201
since I announced my cancer.

16:45.302 --> 16:48.208
Turns out people do have
sympathy for the devil,

16:48.341 --> 16:53.310
and if these Chinese witch doctors I have
on call can keep me alive long enough,

16:53.529 --> 16:56.794
I'll tie you up
in red tape for years.

17:00.607 --> 17:03.849
Robert may never be king.

17:09.372 --> 17:13.435
You remember that paparazzo

She claims to have a new
boyfriend. Who is he?

19:10.068 --> 19:12.755
Protection officer Jasper Frost.

19:13.037 --> 19:15.740
The bodyguard?
That will never last.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.586

19:19.302 --> 19:21.716

19:24.232 --> 19:25.583
Forgive the interruption,
your highness.

19:25.607 --> 19:27.529
Her majesty requests
your presence.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.974
Cyrus has no intention
of stepping down.

19:33.123 --> 19:36.623
He'll contest your "claim".
Says it's all a matter of law.

19:36.724 --> 19:40.169
He's even ready to launch a smear
campaign questioning your mental health!

19:40.247 --> 19:42.076
After all you've been through!

19:42.224 --> 19:45.146
I'll release every bit of
blackmail I've collected on him.

19:45.324 --> 19:48.794
We are trying to create
a better image, look unified.

19:48.919 --> 19:50.692
Drastic times, son.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.340
Drastic enough to
let the public know

19:52.434 --> 19:55.387
Cyrus caused that outbreak
of syphilis in the cotswolds!

19:55.583 --> 19:59.419
Look, calm down. Otherwise there
won't be a throne for me to sit on.

20:00.153 --> 20:02.723
I'll pay him my respects,
have a chat.

20:02.997 --> 20:04.665
I'll find a way through this.

20:08.122 --> 20:10.161
All will be well.

20:18.958 --> 20:21.315
Fetch me a Perrier.

20:21.922 --> 20:24.256
I'm thirsty.

20:25.981 --> 20:28.950
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you not a footman?

20:29.426 --> 20:31.492
Oh, that's right.
You have a gun.

20:33.335 --> 20:36.820
Glock 17, 9mm?

20:37.059 --> 20:39.398
I'm not gonna play this game
with you.

20:40.109 --> 20:42.788
"I'm not gonna play this game
with you, sir."

20:43.663 --> 20:45.820
You're not keen
on appropriate, eh?

20:46.195 --> 20:48.890
If it makes you feel small, you
don't have to call me a "sir".

20:49.038 --> 20:52.343
But, a "sir" is what I am.

20:52.578 --> 20:54.163
My birth right.

20:54.749 --> 20:57.398
You on the other hand,
what do you have a right to?

21:00.374 --> 21:01.773
Nice tassels.

21:01.906 --> 21:04.025
Ha!
Used by the lords Beckwith

21:04.093 --> 21:07.476
to cut invaders down to size for
300 years.

21:07.718 --> 21:11.570
So you can stroke your
standard-issue 9mm all you like.

21:11.851 --> 21:14.992
Caliber has a very different
meaning here in the palace.

21:16.445 --> 21:18.712
You're not good enough for her.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.898
Don't get above your station.

21:24.060 --> 21:25.718
HRH!

21:27.148 --> 21:28.984
Big day, huh?
Yeah.

21:29.130 --> 21:30.460
Sorry, got to dash.

21:30.542 --> 21:33.695
Gotta grab the order of the royal
garter from the beefeaters.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.928
May I have permission to throw
him off the goddamn roof?

21:42.038 --> 21:43.533
What shit did he say to you?

21:43.648 --> 21:46.874
Exactly the kind of thing you'd
expect from someone of his "caliber".

21:47.038 --> 21:49.054
Tell me.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.976
Technically speaking I'm your
boss and I insist you tell me.

21:53.108 --> 21:55.070
That sounds exactly like him.

21:55.226 --> 21:57.745
Okay, technically speaking,
I'm your friend.

21:58.429 --> 22:00.656
And as your friend,
I'd like you tell me, please.

22:01.156 --> 22:04.617
Where I come from, the rules
are, may the best man win.

22:05.796 --> 22:08.132
Your system, it's a load of...

22:08.226 --> 22:10.658
'"..Bollocks how everyone's
forgotten about ♪kingliam."'

22:10.683 --> 22:14.312
'ah, ah, y-y-y-yes,
and-and another viewer texted

22:14.429 --> 22:17.320
a Phoenix should be added

22:17.445 --> 22:18.929
Thoughts on that, John?'

22:19.054 --> 22:21.687
'you know, I was
a fan of ♪kingliam as well.

22:21.788 --> 22:23.632
Maybe we should
have an election.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.859
Let us choose between
two good candidates,

22:25.921 --> 22:27.508
Robert and Liam.'

22:27.577 --> 22:30.656
'that could be sedition but I
won't tell anyone you said it.'

22:30.734 --> 22:34.601
'Just hearing that the public has been
allowed onto the palace grounds.'

22:35.617 --> 22:38.453
- What is your problem?
- I need to talk to someone.

22:38.640 --> 22:41.945
Unless it's about the two hottest Princes
in the world I don't wanna hear it.

22:42.337 --> 22:43.937
Then you're gonna wanna hear it.

22:46.554 --> 22:48.796
Are you seriously dating
both Princes?

22:48.865 --> 22:50.546
Angie, help me out.

22:50.742 --> 22:52.945
They're both in my life, they're
both wonderful.

22:53.070 --> 22:55.812
My head is spinning.
I'm confused, freaking out.

22:55.921 --> 22:57.481
Please tell me
you did it in the palace!

22:57.647 --> 22:59.812
- Angie!
- Well, did you?

23:00.937 --> 23:03.640
Robert wanted to keep it
a secret, so, no.

23:04.101 --> 23:05.444
And with Liam,

23:05.523 --> 23:08.115
the relationship was over before
it began.

23:08.328 --> 23:10.992
That's the thing,
even though it was so brief,

23:11.101 --> 23:14.312
the connection I had
with Liam felt so real.

23:14.515 --> 23:16.203
It felt like things
were serious.

23:16.570 --> 23:18.406
I still can't believe
this is happening.

23:18.546 --> 23:20.828
I always said the Davis girls
would go far!

23:20.953 --> 23:23.831
Robert never intended it to go
anywhere but then today...

23:23.937 --> 23:27.632
Okay, under normal
circumstances, I'd say dump him.

23:27.843 --> 23:30.242
He kept you a secret because
you're common, the prick.

23:30.390 --> 23:32.718
But, he's going to be king,

23:32.960 --> 23:35.296
so maybe don't throw the prick
out with the bathwater.

23:35.429 --> 23:38.195
Let's just make this
about two boys, okay?

23:38.335 --> 23:39.992
Boy A and boy B.

23:40.148 --> 23:42.015
Help me think how
to handle it, please!

23:42.054 --> 23:45.162
Okay, okay, okay, forgive me
if I keep hearing "Prince".

23:45.975 --> 23:49.332
I say... go for both.

23:50.226 --> 23:52.648
That is one very wobbly h.

23:53.835 --> 23:56.093
Alright, I'm only
telling the truth,

23:56.234 --> 23:58.601
which is something
you should not do.

23:59.515 --> 24:00.788
'We gotta tell Robert
the truth.'

24:00.812 --> 24:02.788
you're right, of course.

24:03.945 --> 24:06.007
It's the honorable thing to do,

24:06.374 --> 24:08.444
no matter the fallout.

24:10.435 --> 24:12.568
It should be me that tells him.

24:12.976 --> 24:15.703
- Brother to brother.
- You'll tell him today?

24:17.046 --> 24:19.023
The sooner the better, eh?

24:35.767 --> 24:36.915
What?

24:37.015 --> 24:38.619
Jasper.

24:39.986 --> 24:41.627
Bodyguard's
a tattle-tale, huh.

24:41.697 --> 24:43.689
No. Liam told me.

24:43.978 --> 24:45.962
I was only having a laugh.

24:46.556 --> 24:48.275
What do you see in him anyway?

24:48.448 --> 24:50.463
Is it the "stable boy" thing?

24:50.931 --> 24:52.791
Class isn't about
who you are, Beck!

24:52.885 --> 24:54.486
It's about how you act.

24:54.588 --> 24:58.213
All of this means nothing without
the behavior to back it up.

24:59.861 --> 25:03.064
Have some grace, arsehole.

25:15.525 --> 25:19.529
Ah, the conquering hero returns.

25:21.791 --> 25:23.466
I haven't conquered
anything, uncle.

25:23.791 --> 25:27.400
Uncles and nephews have a pretty
tricky history in this country.

25:27.697 --> 25:30.033
- Dear old Richard III...
- Yeah.

25:31.236 --> 25:34.262
But you wouldn't put Liam and I
under the stairs in the tower.

25:34.322 --> 25:36.023
Don't be so sure.

25:36.775 --> 25:39.816
Come on, scar.
Don't be grumpy. It's me.

25:39.947 --> 25:43.533
Where's the chap I used to go
to when dad was too hard on me?

25:44.033 --> 25:47.838
Where's the chap who gave me my
first sip of liquor?

25:48.650 --> 25:50.385
And my second.

25:51.930 --> 25:55.150
Took you to Madame Gigi, too.

25:56.103 --> 25:58.744
You have led me down
a number of meaningful

25:58.838 --> 26:00.580
and memorable paths, uncle.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.783
And I'll be eternally grateful.

26:09.439 --> 26:11.214
You're fighting like a champ.

26:11.650 --> 26:15.103
The cancer.
I hate to see you ill.

26:15.697 --> 26:19.002
And now you're fighting with
your former ally, Queen Helena.

26:19.166 --> 26:20.790
You must be exhausted.

26:20.955 --> 26:23.861
Your mother
is a complete cauchemar.

26:25.439 --> 26:27.530
She's wrong about the balcony.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.767
It should be yours,
crown and all.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.627
I won't fight you on it.

26:32.077 --> 26:33.939
Technically, you are king.

26:34.885 --> 26:38.575
And after the balcony? Your
blood claim to the throne.

26:38.799 --> 26:41.986
How do you propose we deal with
that little footnote?

26:42.322 --> 26:44.783
Honestly? I don't know.

26:45.385 --> 26:48.251
With father gone
and Lucius, too,

26:49.150 --> 26:51.621
I was hoping for some guidance
from you.

26:52.072 --> 26:55.338
This is a highly
unusual situation,

26:55.642 --> 26:58.995
and I don't have experience
in such matters.

26:59.892 --> 27:02.932
I genuinely value your opinion.

27:04.501 --> 27:08.037
Perhaps, the courts
should decide.

27:10.056 --> 27:11.541
Could we keep it
behind closed doors?

27:11.610 --> 27:15.235
Now, mum will Fawn to the press,
they'll treat it like chum,

27:15.314 --> 27:17.580
if we could keep it private.

27:18.571 --> 27:21.517
Let the upper Echelons
of the Nation decide,

27:21.704 --> 27:23.353
behind closed doors.

27:23.773 --> 27:25.607
A privy council.

27:26.423 --> 27:29.860
That is a great idea,
a privy council.

27:30.579 --> 27:32.157
Do you think mum will go for it?

27:32.233 --> 27:34.467
She will if you convince her.

27:43.212 --> 27:44.517
Darling.

27:44.595 --> 27:46.110
Cyrus is being a dick,

27:46.204 --> 27:49.012
so the exact choreography
of the balcony is in flux,

27:49.080 --> 27:52.626
but whatever happens you must
stand by your brother.

27:52.782 --> 27:57.321
Make sure you're on his right-hand
side, but one step behind.

27:57.571 --> 28:00.704
I know. Protocol, protocol.

28:00.845 --> 28:04.556
- But we're clear?
- Yeah. I know my place.

28:05.662 --> 28:07.362
You're feeling jilted.

28:13.376 --> 28:15.738
Only a week ago, the public
wanted you to be king.

28:15.807 --> 28:17.501
It's not about that.

28:17.704 --> 28:21.134
And now you must
literally stand aside.

28:21.314 --> 28:23.913
And yes, you must stand behind
your brother.

28:23.982 --> 28:27.984
People need tribes
and chieftains.

28:28.259 --> 28:29.852
Who stands where,

28:30.103 --> 28:32.579
who has the tallest feathers on
their head.

28:32.681 --> 28:35.329
People crave hierarchy.

28:35.470 --> 28:38.761
They look to bloodlines for it
because... family matters.

28:38.830 --> 28:40.668
To everyone.

28:40.824 --> 28:43.058
So, we will stand today
on that balcony

28:43.144 --> 28:46.933
as the personification
of the idealized family

28:47.144 --> 28:51.543
and people in our nation, dare I
say across the world,

28:51.660 --> 28:55.230
will feel more settled
and secure because of it.

28:57.183 --> 28:59.649
I don't blame them
for needing that.

29:00.574 --> 29:04.187
We all need some stability after
what we've gone through this year.

29:04.371 --> 29:07.057
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

29:08.893 --> 29:13.519
You are the right hand of
the future king of England.

29:13.652 --> 29:16.683
You stand, literally,
to symbolize that.

29:16.777 --> 29:21.308
So, yes, you do have a place.

29:22.226 --> 29:24.327
And it means so much.

29:26.621 --> 29:28.316
Mum...

29:29.019 --> 29:30.418
I understand.

29:30.629 --> 29:32.332
I always have.

29:32.855 --> 29:34.465
I'll do my best.

29:44.597 --> 29:47.753
I owe you an apology. We haven't spent
enough time together since I've been back

29:47.777 --> 29:49.499
and that's on me.

29:50.176 --> 29:51.590
You've been busy.

29:51.933 --> 29:54.437
To be honest,
things have changed so much.

29:54.933 --> 29:57.740
It's harder than I imagined
settling back in.

29:59.254 --> 30:01.090
I miss dad.

30:04.722 --> 30:06.516
Me too.

30:06.887 --> 30:10.105
I wish he was here now,
to help guide us through.

30:10.932 --> 30:13.032
At least I've still got you.

30:14.956 --> 30:17.292
Mum's been filling me in on
everything you've been doing,

30:17.324 --> 30:19.988
all your charity work.
I'm proud of you.

30:20.222 --> 30:24.074
She thought maybe I should take it
over considering my military service.

30:24.808 --> 30:27.363
Sure. Take it. Makes sense.

30:27.432 --> 30:29.637
I saw Kathryn today.
It was nice.

30:29.863 --> 30:32.642
I thought you
said you'd been practicing?

30:49.704 --> 30:53.129
Game. At least some things
never change.

31:10.682 --> 31:12.072
Hey.

31:13.056 --> 31:14.978
I owe you an apology.

31:15.361 --> 31:17.814
I forgot what it means
to be a gentleman today.

31:18.034 --> 31:19.775
Yes, you did.

31:20.150 --> 31:23.704
Thanks for reminding me.
I am sorry.

31:24.470 --> 31:27.573
Sometimes I wish things between
us had been able to...

31:27.681 --> 31:30.542
Remain innocent like it was
when we were kids.

31:33.579 --> 31:36.806
And in light of how long
we've known each other,

31:37.001 --> 31:40.642
all we've shared and how much we've
cared for each other over the years,

31:40.814 --> 31:42.931
will you accept my apology?

31:44.754 --> 31:46.420
