01:00.685 --> 01:01.978
{\an7}Oh, what's
taking so long?

01:02.061 --> 01:06.524
{\an8}Looks like
the school assembly
is a hot ticket.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.611
{\an8}Mind if I cut, Ginger?

01:09.694 --> 01:11.112
{\an8}You're so nice.

01:18.369 --> 01:19.120
{\an8}Sorry, ladies.

01:19.204 --> 01:19.579
{\an8}Last seats just went.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.748
{\an8}Standing room only.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.633
MILTY:
In the past several weeks,

01:31.716 --> 01:33.551
a handful of
junior high students

01:33.635 --> 01:38.139
were found loitering
off school grounds at the wall.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.516
(<i> students reacting with shock</i> )

01:39.599 --> 01:41.684
People.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.227
People.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.853
Now, I needn't remind you

01:43.937 --> 01:47.857
that the wall is technically
part of the high school,

01:47.941 --> 01:50.401
therefore only
high school students

01:50.485 --> 01:53.947
are allowed to congregate there,
so as of today,

01:54.030 --> 01:58.326
any junior high student
caught maxin', relaxin'

01:58.409 --> 02:00.703
or just plain
"cold chillin'" there

02:00.787 --> 02:03.414
will be eligible for suspension.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.459
{\an4}Maybe you should
try spending some
time there, Ginger.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.711
{\an5}Then we wouldn't
have to see you
for a few days.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.005
{\an1}And break
school rules?

02:11.089 --> 02:12.465
{\an1}Oh, nonsense,
Miranda.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.467
{\an1}Ginger is
a nice girl.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.721
{\an4}MRS. GORDON:
An elective class
for fifth graders

02:18.805 --> 02:20.890
{\an1}makes about as much sense
as elective surgery...

02:20.974 --> 02:24.352
but that caught on,
so here.

02:24.435 --> 02:25.562
Hear that, Hoods?

02:25.645 --> 02:26.521
An elective class.

02:26.604 --> 02:29.232
Fill out the form,
and return it immediately,

02:29.315 --> 02:30.108
as classes
are starting tomorrow.

02:30.191 --> 02:33.570
Now, the whole point
of an elective class

02:33.653 --> 02:37.282
is to choose a subject
that genuinely appeals to you,

02:37.365 --> 02:41.244
so don't just pick what
your friends are picking.

02:42.829 --> 02:43.580
{\an1}Cooking?!

02:43.663 --> 02:46.124
Why not modern dance,
or pole vaulting--

02:46.207 --> 02:47.959
you know, an area where
we stand to shine?

02:48.042 --> 02:51.588
{\an1}Because cooking is where
all the big bucks are.

02:51.671 --> 02:52.589
You learn a few
crummy recipes--

02:52.672 --> 02:54.757
instant franchise.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.009
{\an4}I'm talking
cable TV shows,
bottled sauce,

02:56.092 --> 02:59.304
{\an1}signature steak knives--
the whole shebang.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.806
I know what
a franchise is, Carl.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.142
I learn the same
vocabulary words as you.

03:04.225 --> 03:08.062
{\an5}CARL:
Point is, everyone and his
mother is getting in on it,

03:08.146 --> 03:10.023
with the exception
of two young boys.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.733
{\an1}There's a gaping hole
in the marketplace

03:11.816 --> 03:14.235
just begging
to be filled.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.070
But Carl, we don't cook.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.364
We don't cook <i> yet,</i> Hoods.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.576
We don't cook <i> yet.</i>

03:35.715 --> 03:38.343
(<i> panting</i> )

03:38.426 --> 03:41.220
What did Courtney mean by
those "nice girl" cracks?

03:41.304 --> 03:43.306
Which one-- that
they finish last,

03:43.389 --> 03:44.432
or that you are one?

03:44.515 --> 03:45.433
{\an1}Both.

03:45.516 --> 03:46.225
What's so wrong

03:46.309 --> 03:46.809
with being nice,
anyway?

03:46.893 --> 03:49.312
It worked
for St. Clair,

03:49.395 --> 03:50.605
or is she a lake?

03:50.688 --> 03:53.441
They said "nice," but what
they meant was "uncool."

03:53.524 --> 03:55.360
{\an3}"Dorky."

03:55.443 --> 03:56.736
{\an1}"Losers."

04:00.782 --> 04:02.700
(<i> sighs</i> )

04:02.784 --> 04:05.036
I bet he can wear it.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.830
That's Jake,
10th grade,

04:07.914 --> 04:09.540
and anyone with
a pierced eyebrow

04:09.624 --> 04:10.625
wouldn't be
caught dead

04:10.708 --> 04:12.043
in petroleum-based
action wear.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.544
Those leaners are
totally into him.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.421
Leaners?

04:15.505 --> 04:17.173
Those cool girls
he's talking to.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.048
Right... cool,
not "nice."

04:18.132 --> 04:21.386
Don't tell me
a nice girl like you

04:21.469 --> 04:25.098
might be interested
in a cool guy like that.

04:25.181 --> 04:28.309
Hey, I can lean,
too, you know.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.187
(<i> whistle blowing</i> )

04:32.397 --> 04:37.318
That pierced eyebrow's
got throbbing infection

04:37.402 --> 04:37.694
written all over it.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.696
I don't know...

04:39.779 --> 04:43.658
{\an1}I'm thinking about
hanging at the wall.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.205
{\an1}Thinking about
hanging out at the wall

04:49.288 --> 04:51.958
{\an1}and actually doing it
are not the same thing.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.293
{\an4}MACIE:
Enough about
the wall.

04:53.376 --> 04:57.714
{\an1}A person's reputation
could be damaged forever.

04:57.797 --> 04:58.715
{\an3}Macie,

04:58.798 --> 05:01.551
{\an5}our reputations
may already be
damaged forever...

05:01.634 --> 05:03.553
as a bunch
of dweebs!

05:03.636 --> 05:04.512
Ginger's right.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.848
{\an1}Are you saying
hanging, cold chilling

05:06.931 --> 05:08.975
{\an1}and maxing and
relaxing at the wall

05:09.058 --> 05:11.477
are worth being
suspended over?

05:11.561 --> 05:12.937
Well... no.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.231
Ginger, I hate to dredge up
a painful memory,

05:15.314 --> 05:17.775
but you do have
a preexisting criminal record

05:17.859 --> 05:19.527
{\an4}from when you
got busted for
trying to steal.

05:19.610 --> 05:24.991
So technically, you've already
proven you're not a nice girl.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.075
Macie,

05:26.159 --> 05:26.993
water under the bridge
is soon forgotten.

05:27.076 --> 05:29.746
Besides, I don't
think Ginger means

05:29.829 --> 05:31.164
doing anything
quite that drastic.

05:31.247 --> 05:34.500
How about we just try
passing by the wall

05:34.584 --> 05:37.086
on our way home
from school today?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.547
They won't suspend
you for that.

05:39.630 --> 05:40.339
Uh... can't.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.340
Dental appointment.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.467
{\an1}If you're looking
for an edgier image,

05:42.550 --> 05:47.430
{\an5}why don't you ask
Dr. Weinstein
for gold fronts?

05:47.680 --> 05:50.516
It worked for Kold Mo Gee.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.769
WOMAN:
And up until recently,

05:52.852 --> 05:54.103
I was proud chef and owner

05:54.187 --> 05:57.106
of Chez Maison,
the renowned French eatery.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.232
What happened?

05:58.316 --> 06:00.777
Sometimes adults need
new challenges.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.195
{\an1}CARL:
Chapter 11,

06:02.278 --> 06:03.071
am I right?

06:03.154 --> 06:04.655
You don't know
the work it takes

06:04.739 --> 06:05.823
to keep a restaurant going.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.451
{\an1}The competition is brutal,
but the real culprit

06:08.534 --> 06:09.452
{\an1}is all those
cable cooking channels.

06:09.535 --> 06:13.456
{\an1}They convince every amateur
who ever boiled an egg

06:13.539 --> 06:14.499
that they can puff pastry

06:14.582 --> 06:17.001
just by watching
someone else do it on TV.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.879
But... my loss
is your gain.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.714
(<i> laughing</i> )

06:21.798 --> 06:25.134
That's what we're
banking on.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.188
{\an5}So Sean,
Lexie Lanoux's
having a party

06:37.271 --> 06:40.024
Wednesday night,
while her 'rents

06:40.108 --> 06:42.068
{\an1}are off at some
conference.

06:42.151 --> 06:42.819
{\an3}Cool.

06:42.902 --> 06:43.778
It's going to be
a real blowout.

06:43.861 --> 06:46.030
Mark's going to DJ,

06:46.114 --> 06:48.783
{\an4}and Will Patterson's
going to chug
50 cherry colas

06:48.866 --> 06:49.992
{\an1}and demo
extreme burping.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.869
{\an1}And get this,
dudester.

06:51.953 --> 06:52.495
Slick Willy said

06:52.578 --> 06:54.705
her parents have
a hot tub.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.748
{\an1}A hot tub?
Righteous!

06:55.832 --> 06:57.583
Time for your
cleaning, Ginger,

06:57.667 --> 07:01.254
though I doubt
it will be necessary.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.256
He just went on and on

07:03.339 --> 07:07.218
about a party Lexie Lanoux's
having Wednesday.

07:07.301 --> 07:08.302
{\an5}DODIE:
He didn't notice
you at all?

07:08.386 --> 07:11.848
{\an1}He did, but at precisely
the wrong moment.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.182
I've gone from
being nice girl

07:13.266 --> 07:16.769
{\an1}to being nice girl with
the clean mouth of the month.

07:16.853 --> 07:17.937
Well, I think
I know a way

07:18.020 --> 07:19.355
to change the nice girl
impression a bit...

07:19.438 --> 07:23.025
{\an5}if you're willing
to live a little
dangerously.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.945
I'm not sure I like
the sound of this.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.405
{\an1}Are you
thinking...

07:27.488 --> 07:28.739
Crash Lexie's party.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.241
{\an1}Oh, Dodie,
it's brilliant.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.201
If by "brilliant," you mean

07:32.285 --> 07:32.910
supremely irresponsible,

07:32.994 --> 07:35.163
I would have to agree.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.706
You'll make
yourself cool,

07:36.789 --> 07:38.124
reinvent your
image to Jake,

07:38.207 --> 07:40.418
and all without
risking suspension

07:40.501 --> 07:41.711
by hanging
at the wall.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.462
How do you figure that math?

07:43.546 --> 07:44.922
{\an7}Because only
someone cool enough

07:45.006 --> 07:46.883
{\an8}to stand at the wall

07:46.966 --> 07:47.884
{\an7}would dare
crash a party.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.719
I don't know.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.012
A party on a school night?

07:51.095 --> 07:53.222
{\an1}Macie, it's about time
we took some risks.

07:53.306 --> 07:57.643
Like my mom always says, "What's
life without taking chances?"

08:00.479 --> 08:02.565
What's for dinner?

08:02.648 --> 08:03.357
{\an1}Beats me.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.400
Ask your brother.

08:04.483 --> 08:07.153
Carl? In charge
of dinner?

08:08.321 --> 08:11.032
But Mom,
I want to live.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.950
You ain't lived
till you've sampled

08:13.034 --> 08:16.245
my proprietary feet-loaf
with trashed potatoes

08:16.329 --> 08:16.787
and fried bunions.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.623
{\an3}Well...

08:18.706 --> 08:19.665
(<i> sniffs</i> )

08:19.749 --> 08:21.083
it doesn't
smell bad.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.752
No, not bad at all.

08:22.835 --> 08:23.711
Load me up,
cookie foot.

08:23.794 --> 08:28.716
After all, what's life
without taking chances?

08:30.676 --> 08:31.427
{\an1}Hm...

08:31.510 --> 08:34.096
{\an1}I got to be honest
with you, kid.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.097
(<i> groans</i> )

08:35.181 --> 08:36.140
This stuff is great.

08:36.224 --> 08:40.311
{\an4}You can fry
my bunions
anytime.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.312
Slam dunk.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.023
Today the Foutleys,
tomorrow...

08:44.106 --> 08:46.275
everyone else who eats.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.568
Exactly right, Mom.

08:47.652 --> 08:51.656
What is life without
taking chances?

09:03.876 --> 09:05.253

09:05.336 --> 09:07.463
we're in the ninth grade,
and avoid Will Patterson.

any extreme

That girl's going
to twist her spine

09:26.315 --> 09:29.485
{\an1}all the way to
the emergency room.

09:29.568 --> 09:29.902
Come on, guys.

This way.

Come on in,
ladies.

09:39.495 --> 09:42.581
Oh, no... no, thanks.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.749
No.

if you ask me, gentlemen.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.006
{\an5}DODIE:
I heard the safest place
to hang at these things

09:50.089 --> 09:52.300
is at the food table.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.677
That way, if you don't
want to talk or dance,

09:54.760 --> 09:56.345
you can always eat.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.682
What do we do now?

09:59.765 --> 10:02.351
Just try to act
like we belong.

10:02.435 --> 10:06.480
{\an5}Right... maybe
no one will notice
that we don't.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.238
(<i> different song playing</i> )

10:14.322 --> 10:16.782
(<i> yet another song playing</i> )

10:16.866 --> 10:19.201
I don't think
our plan's working, guys.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.997
We haven't talked to anyone,
and we haven't seen Jake.

10:23.080 --> 10:27.335
{\an4}How late will
our parents buy us
still doing research?

10:27.418 --> 10:28.878
GINGER:
You're right.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.421
We better go.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.882
(<i> burping</i> )

10:32.965 --> 10:34.342
GINGER:
Oh, that's great.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.217
MACIE:
Gross.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.218
DODIE:
That's a gift.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.096
{\an5}MACIE:
Hate to be
a den mother,

10:39.180 --> 10:40.806
but key check.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.434
My house keys.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.185
Oh, no.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.146
I must have dropped them inside.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.899
I'll be right back.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.652
(<i> slow dance song playing</i> )

11:00.785 --> 11:01.577
Ow! Yech.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.287
Hey, it's Clean Mouth
of the Month.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.998
What are you doing
under the snack table?

11:06.082 --> 11:07.625
I lost my keys.

11:07.708 --> 11:08.626
Got that beat.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.710
I lost my nachos.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.713
Too much crowd surfing
on a full stomach.

11:17.259 --> 11:17.760
{\an1}Oh...

11:17.843 --> 11:19.011
(<i> laughing nervously</i> )

11:19.095 --> 11:20.221
I better go.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.973
So what's your
name again?

11:23.057 --> 11:25.601
Ah... Ginger.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.770
(<i> laughing nervously</i> )

11:28.312 --> 11:29.480
Couldn't find them...

11:29.563 --> 11:33.025
but I bumped into Jake,
literally.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.735
What happened?

11:34.819 --> 11:36.112
I want full
disclosure.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.697
GINGER:
Nothing happened.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.782
He was cool, and I freaked.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.200
Let's go.

11:43.577 --> 11:44.620
But Carl, how long

11:44.703 --> 11:47.415
till the signature
steak knives?

11:47.498 --> 11:48.332
Patience, my friend.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.960
{\an1}We still have to
copyright our sauce.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.879
{\an1}But once our reputation
takes off,

11:53.963 --> 11:56.132
{\an1}we'll be ready
for our close-up.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.300
{\an4}BLAKE:
Your working-class
striving

11:58.384 --> 12:00.136
{\an4}is quite
touching, really.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.095
And even though 98%

12:01.178 --> 12:04.807
of all small businesses
fail within a year,

12:04.890 --> 12:06.225
how can I help you?

12:06.308 --> 12:07.810
By ordering, Gripling.

12:07.893 --> 12:08.853
And we won't fail.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.646
{\an1}We hold the patent
on gross-out cuisine.

12:10.729 --> 12:13.649
We'll be a big hit,
and sell out for millions

12:13.732 --> 12:15.651
{\an5}to a food
and beverage
conglomerate

12:15.734 --> 12:17.486
who will then underwrite
our cooking show

12:17.570 --> 12:21.031
{\an5}amongst other
profit-yielding
ventures.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.575
{\an1}Ah... shrewd
business strategy.

12:22.658 --> 12:26.662
{\an5}So what will it be:
Mac and Sneeze,
or French Flies?

12:26.745 --> 12:27.830
Both.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.291
After all, the name
Gripling is synonymous

12:30.374 --> 12:31.500
with culinary adventure.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.045
{\an1}I thought it was
synonymous with Gripling.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.473
Not bad.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.016
The French Flies rest
lightly on the palate,

12:47.099 --> 12:51.812
{\an1}and the Mac and Sneeze has
a vaguely Stilton-like bouquet.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.898
Hey, you parked
your cart

12:53.981 --> 12:54.940
on our first base.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.693
Wow! This stuff looks
a whole lot better

12:57.776 --> 12:59.653
than what Chef Bob's
slinging.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.238
Give me some of
that Mac and Sneeze!

13:01.322 --> 13:03.991
(<i> all clamoring</i> )

13:08.412 --> 13:10.581
(<i> panting</i> )

13:10.664 --> 13:13.792
{\an5}At least we can
say we crashed
a high school party.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.669
Primary goal realized,
I'd say.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.172
It was even worth
losing your keys.

13:18.255 --> 13:21.258
{\an4}Good thing
my mom keeps
an emergency one

13:21.342 --> 13:22.885
{\an1}taped under
the porch railing.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.137
{\an4}Ginger, more
than the primary
goal was reached:

13:25.221 --> 13:27.389
Jake talked to you.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.309
Come on, guys, like...
like he'll even remember.

13:30.392 --> 13:31.727
{\an1}JAKE:
Yo, Ginger.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.145
(<i> girls gasp</i> )

13:33.229 --> 13:34.897
Found your house keys.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.191
(<i> sighs nervously</i> )

13:39.235 --> 13:40.819
Oh... uh...

13:40.903 --> 13:41.529
Thanks.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.947
(<i> grunts</i> )

13:43.030 --> 13:45.908
{\an5}Kind of like when
Cinderella left her
house keys, right?

13:45.991 --> 13:49.245
I... thought it was
a glass slipper.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.122
{\an1}I'm not really
into literature.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.250
Oh, right...
well, um...

13:54.333 --> 13:56.585
got to get
back to class.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.294
{\an3}See you.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.213
Next party, right?

14:01.465 --> 14:03.842
Ginger, you
know Jake?

14:03.926 --> 14:06.136
{\an1}Aren't cool
high school guys

14:06.220 --> 14:07.930
{\an1}a little out
of your league?

14:08.013 --> 14:11.308
{\an5}Oh, we crashed
Lexie Lanoux's
party last night

14:11.392 --> 14:13.394
and ah... I ran
into him, that's all.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.437
Miranda, remember
when I said

14:15.521 --> 14:18.274
we should crash
that party?

14:18.357 --> 14:19.108
It was a school night.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.818
But Ginger, how did
he get your keys?

14:20.901 --> 14:25.322
He must have found them
under the snack table,

14:25.406 --> 14:27.283
after our... tête-à-tête.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.158
Tête-à-tête?

14:28.242 --> 14:30.452
You were with him
under the snack table?

14:30.536 --> 14:33.789
For, like,
two seconds.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.457
Case closed, okay?

14:35.541 --> 14:36.125
Ginger,

14:36.208 --> 14:37.251
{\an1}you're keeping
something from us.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.628
Case closed.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.588
Miranda!

14:40.671 --> 14:41.630
Make her talk.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.047
Got to run, guys...

14:42.131 --> 14:43.799
literally.

14:43.882 --> 14:45.968
It's gym class,
you know.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.472
(<i> thunder</i> )

14:55.769 --> 14:57.521
It's right here
in my contract.

14:57.605 --> 15:01.233
I create menus for
all three schools.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.192
They're muscling in

15:02.276 --> 15:03.819
on my elementary
school business.

15:03.902 --> 15:08.407
Not one person ate my delicious
refried bean sprouts yesterday.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.450
That hurt.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.995
{\an1}Frying anything these days
is pretty passé, Bob.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.288
Should have
seared them,

15:14.371 --> 15:16.123
{\an1}then added a drizzle
of balsamic.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.750
{\an4}CARL:
You did say
pick a subject

15:17.833 --> 15:18.500
that genuinely
interests you.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.711
A drizzle,
you hear?

15:20.794 --> 15:22.755
That didn't mean
to put Chef Bob out of business.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.716
How unfortunate
when teachers fail

15:25.799 --> 15:28.427
to nurture the obvious gifts
of their students.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.512
I still don't
understand

15:30.596 --> 15:32.014
how you two could
draw such business

15:32.097 --> 15:34.183
{\an5}simply with
gross-out names
for your dishes.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.811
It's the name that draws them
in, but it's the taste

15:37.895 --> 15:39.021
that keeps them.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.607
{\an5}If you two don't
shut down that
stand immediately,

15:41.690 --> 15:43.359
I'll take this up with
a higher authority.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.861
Higher authority?

15:45.944 --> 15:50.199
Try this gross beef sandwich
smothered in potatoes au rotten

15:50.282 --> 15:52.868
{\an1}and tell me if
the big guy upstairs

15:52.951 --> 15:55.245
{\an1}isn't already
involved.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.583
(<i> expressing pleasure</i> )

15:59.667 --> 16:04.254
Oh, it's like I swallowed
a little piece of heaven.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.173
Bob, if I'm
not mistaken,

16:06.256 --> 16:08.884
there's a clause
in your contract

16:08.967 --> 16:10.719
regarding
outside vendors,

16:10.803 --> 16:13.889
{\an5}something about
encouraging healthy
competition.

16:13.972 --> 16:18.227
{\an1}Ladies and gentlemen,
this isn't a job.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.230
It's a calling.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.363
Because if you drown
the whole dish

16:29.446 --> 16:32.991
in dressing, Bob,
then you miss the point.

16:34.201 --> 16:37.913
There's more than one way
to shut down them kids.

16:37.996 --> 16:40.749
(<i> students clamoring</i> )

16:45.504 --> 16:47.381
Heads up, Hoods.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.676
{\an1}We got crossover
from the junior high.

16:50.759 --> 16:51.552
Oh, the money crowd.

16:51.635 --> 16:52.553
I don't want to know.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.054
We're running low
on supplies,

16:54.138 --> 16:57.850
{\an1}and I've still got a dozen
steamy joes to make.

16:57.933 --> 17:00.018
If Ginger won't
give us the dish

17:00.102 --> 17:02.771
{\an1}on what happened
between her and Jake,

17:02.855 --> 17:03.939
{\an1}maybe her little
brother will.

17:04.021 --> 17:07.401
{\an5}CARL:
Complimentary
slime-ade, ladies.

17:07.483 --> 17:08.777
(<i> giggling</i> )

17:08.861 --> 17:10.988
Shaken,
not stirred.

17:11.070 --> 17:11.613
{\an1}Oh, Courtney,
what say

17:11.696 --> 17:14.324
{\an1}we bypass
the tiny toddler,

17:14.407 --> 17:18.078
and go straight for
the big boy himself?

17:18.162 --> 17:18.912
Ooh.

17:18.996 --> 17:22.124
Yoohoo... Aren't
you Jake?

17:22.207 --> 17:25.294
Guess this food cart's
not a secret anymore.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.962
(<i> all clamoring</i> )

17:27.045 --> 17:30.632
It's not the only thing
that's not a secret anymore.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.925
What Miranda means is,

17:32.009 --> 17:36.054
we heard Ginger Foutley crashed
a party you were at last night.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.891
Oh, yeah... Clean Mouth.

17:38.974 --> 17:41.059
Clean Mouth?

17:41.143 --> 17:42.478
{\an1}What's that
supposed to mean?

17:42.561 --> 17:45.981
Except it was so dark,
I could, like, barely make out

17:46.064 --> 17:48.067
her pearly whites,
you know?

17:48.150 --> 17:51.653
Did he say
"make out"?

17:51.737 --> 17:54.406
{\an4}And she was
wearing something
"pearly white"?

17:54.490 --> 17:56.784
{\an1}Well, gutsy fashion
choice for evening, no?

17:56.867 --> 18:00.454
Wait till Mitzi gets
a load of this.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.332
{\an1}But Miranda, do you
think it's right

18:03.415 --> 18:05.584
to just trash
Ginger's rep?

18:05.667 --> 18:06.877
Are you kidding?

18:06.960 --> 18:07.669
It's our duty.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.670
Out of my way,
girlfriend.

18:08.754 --> 18:12.716
{\an5}This piece of
gossip is too hot
to keep cold.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.845
Ginger, word's gotten out.

18:16.929 --> 18:17.721
You have a rep.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.057
{\an1}Heard Little
Miss Clean Mouth

18:20.140 --> 18:21.850
had herself quite a night.

18:21.934 --> 18:26.355
Looks like bad girls
finish first.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.481
{\an1}Oh!

18:27.564 --> 18:28.690
Did you hear the way
she said that?

18:28.774 --> 18:31.443
Ginger, remember when
you were complaining

18:31.527 --> 18:32.903
about her calling you nice?

18:32.986 --> 18:33.904
{\an1}Oh, how the winds
have shifted.

18:33.987 --> 18:37.991
It's a positive sign,
if you ask me.

18:48.585 --> 18:49.586
(<i> sighs</i> )

18:49.670 --> 18:51.338
(<i> gasps</i> )

18:52.756 --> 18:55.801
{\an5}GIRL:
Jake...
you know.

18:55.884 --> 18:56.760
Slacker Dude?

18:56.844 --> 18:59.263
She made out
with him!

18:59.346 --> 19:02.015
{\an4}GIRL 2:
He had her
house keys, too.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.517
What's that about?

19:03.600 --> 19:07.980
(<i> flushing</i> )

19:10.148 --> 19:10.858
{\an3}DODIE:
Ginger?

19:10.941 --> 19:12.276
we know you're in there.

19:12.359 --> 19:16.280
We recognize your
characteristic triple flush.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.032
Oh, guys.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.909
What they're saying
isn't true.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.911
I never made out
with Jake.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.163
We believe you,
Ginger.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.582
It's just that we're
having a hard time

19:26.665 --> 19:30.002
getting other people
to believe you.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.255
Fast?

19:33.338 --> 19:35.465
All I did was crash
a stupid party,

19:35.549 --> 19:39.636
{\an1}only everyone wants to believe
that I did more than that.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.847
It's totally unfair.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.266
{\an1}School's going to be
a nightmare today.

19:44.349 --> 19:49.396
{\an4}I know everyone's
going to make really
nasty comments.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.273
{\an1}What am I supposed
to say?

19:51.356 --> 19:53.275
Rubber, glue,
back to you.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.862
Hey, that's not bad.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.740
{\an1}Sometimes that kid's
wise beyond his years.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.742
Rubber, glue,
back to you?

20:01.825 --> 20:05.203
That is so
"elementary school."

20:05.287 --> 20:06.330
Ginger, think about it.

20:06.413 --> 20:09.333
{\an1}You don't have to explain
anything to anyone.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.460
{\an3}I don't?

20:11.543 --> 20:13.086
No, why should you?

20:13.170 --> 20:13.921
Let them talk.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.548
Rubber, glue,
back to you.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.382
Yeah, you're right.

20:17.466 --> 20:21.470
Let them think what
they want to think.

20:21.553 --> 20:22.971
That's my girl.

20:23.055 --> 20:23.722
Thanks, mom.

20:23.805 --> 20:27.517
(<i> all clamoring</i> )

20:30.562 --> 20:32.564
Wait your turn.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.358
Wait your turn!

20:37.361 --> 20:40.322
{\an1}Hoods...
could it be?

20:41.573 --> 20:42.157
Sir, let me guess.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.034
{\an1}You're with
the food channel,

20:44.117 --> 20:46.578
{\an4}and you're here
to offer us
a sweet deal.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.456
I'm with the Health
Department, boys,

20:49.539 --> 20:51.667
and I'm here
to shut you down.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.752
Boy, Carl, you
weren't even close.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.921
Shut us down?

20:56.004 --> 20:57.089
But what did we do?

20:57.172 --> 21:01.927
No food protector,
hair nets or gloves;

21:02.010 --> 21:03.512
meat stored with dairy?

21:03.595 --> 21:07.015
Not to mention, this operation
is a breeding ground for germs.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.267
By order of
the Health Department,

21:09.351 --> 21:13.981
this cart is hereby
permanently closed.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.066
But I've got a hood.

21:16.149 --> 21:19.111
I don't need a hair net!

21:21.655 --> 21:24.032
{\an5}DODIE:
And they just
shut them down,

21:24.116 --> 21:24.616
just like that?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.868
Yep.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.496
Carl says that now his
reputation is also ruined,

21:29.579 --> 21:32.457
so I guess it runs
in the family.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.334
Let people think

21:34.418 --> 21:36.545
{\an1}what they want
to think, right?

21:36.628 --> 21:37.629
Or let people think

21:37.713 --> 21:39.881
what you wanted them
to think, right, Ginger?

21:39.965 --> 21:42.384
I guess... but Macie,
I wanted them to think

21:42.467 --> 21:45.387
I was someone cool enough
to crash a high school party,

21:45.470 --> 21:49.558
not someone who rolls around
under picnic tables

21:49.641 --> 21:50.684
with tenth-grade boys.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.477
I would just
like to point out

21:52.561 --> 21:54.104
that I crashed
that party also,

21:54.187 --> 21:57.691
{\an5}and it did
absolutely nothing
for my reputation.

21:57.774 --> 21:58.233
{\an3}<i>Nada.</i>

21:58.317 --> 22:00.235
COURTNEY:
Well, Ginger,

22:00.318 --> 22:02.738
{\an1}I'm glad those ugly
rumors about you

22:02.821 --> 22:04.573
{\an1}have finally
been put to rest.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.867
{\an1}Word is, Jake
has a girlfriend,

22:06.950 --> 22:07.743
and it's not you.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.578
Surprise.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.454
And my apologies

22:10.537 --> 22:12.664
{\an1}for contributing
to the mix-up.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.875
{\an1}Perhaps I was
a little jealous.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.668
{\an1}I mean, it
was bad enough

22:16.752 --> 22:17.836
{\an1}you crashed
a party I didn't.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.921
It was a school
night, okay?

22:20.005 --> 22:21.089
But it was
très annoying

22:21.173 --> 22:24.468
being pushed out
of the limelight...

22:24.551 --> 22:25.510
if only for a minute.

22:25.594 --> 22:26.470
I was starting to feel

22:26.553 --> 22:27.137
like I didn't
even know you.

22:27.220 --> 22:30.348
{\an1}Actually, for
a minute there,

22:30.432 --> 22:33.643
{\an1}I don't think
I even knew myself.

22:33.727 --> 22:34.311
Hm... must
have been

22:34.394 --> 22:36.229
the best minute
of your life.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.899
{\an1}Rubber, glue,
back to you, Miranda.
