WEBVTT

00:15.125 --> 00:16.666
-Whoa!

00:19.500 --> 00:20.916
Ah!

00:27.083 --> 00:28.583
-Ah! No!
-Huh?

00:30.583 --> 00:31.416
Ah!

00:32.583 --> 00:33.500
Ouch!

00:45.750 --> 00:47.791
-Hey!

00:55.750 --> 00:58.666
<i>What does it mean</i>
<i>to be truly alone?</i>

00:58.750 --> 01:03.875
<i>I have had ample time to ponder</i>
<i>this question all these long years,</i>

01:03.958 --> 01:07.208
<i>wandering these halls</i>
<i>from witching hour to dawn,</i>

01:07.291 --> 01:09.916
<i>with only the creak of foot on the floor,</i>

01:10.000 --> 01:13.916
<i>and the whisper of the wind</i>
<i>through the eaves to keep me company.</i>

01:17.958 --> 01:21.291
<i>But in my heart, I am alone.</i>

01:21.375 --> 01:24.208
-Patience!
-Reginald!

01:24.291 --> 01:28.541
My darling sister, why are you awake
at this late, late hour?

01:28.625 --> 01:33.125
A beautiful young woman such as yourself
should be tucked up in her boudoir

01:33.208 --> 01:37.000
as soon as the night cockerel
has sungeth his sweet lullaby.

01:37.083 --> 01:39.333
-Wouldn't you agree, Uncle?

01:39.416 --> 01:41.750
It is not for me
to agree or disagree

01:41.833 --> 01:43.166
with the choices of man,

01:43.250 --> 01:46.541
for I am something beyond humanity now.

01:46.625 --> 01:50.541
And when the full moon emerges
from the clouds outside,

01:50.625 --> 01:53.875
you'll see, you'll both see…

01:53.958 --> 01:55.791
-Even Mildred will see!

01:56.583 --> 01:58.958
Cousin Patience, I can't sleep.

01:59.041 --> 02:01.958
Cousin Gail,
it is far past your bedtime.

02:02.458 --> 02:05.458
Forgive me,
but I had such awful night horrors.

02:05.541 --> 02:08.791
Visions of witches,
gargoyles and communists.

02:08.875 --> 02:13.416
Oh, my ghost, Patience…
something is wrong.

02:16.125 --> 02:19.583
One of you, all of you,
you're not meant to be here.

02:19.666 --> 02:22.250
Now, now, back to bed with you.

02:22.333 --> 02:25.416
All right, dear,
let me fetch you some bubbly milk,

02:25.500 --> 02:27.791
and I'll see you back to your slumber.

02:27.875 --> 02:30.750
This is wrong.
You're not supposed to be here, you.

02:30.833 --> 02:34.416
All of you,
you're not supposed to be here!

02:39.500 --> 02:40.833
What the… Barney!

02:40.916 --> 02:43.666
I asked you to stop
dressing me up when I fall asleep.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.041
-Dressing you up?

02:46.125 --> 02:49.208
And who is this Barney you speak of?

02:49.291 --> 02:51.875
What? Barney, wake up!

02:52.833 --> 02:56.333
Ow, Pugsley! Pugsley! Pugsley, that hurt!

02:56.416 --> 02:59.208
Wait, why are you in black and white?

02:59.291 --> 03:01.333
Why is everything in black and white?

03:01.416 --> 03:04.583
Well, it looks the same to me.
I think we're in the TV.

03:04.666 --> 03:08.833
In the TV? But this doesn't look like
Pauline's insurance commercial.

03:08.916 --> 03:11.708
I just put the young madam back to sleep.

03:11.791 --> 03:15.500
Thank you, Mildred.
Now go polish all the silver in the house.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.041
Ugh, again?

03:19.333 --> 03:22.625
Hey, Norma! Uh, how do we get home?

03:24.541 --> 03:28.208
What is that? Who… Who are they?

03:28.291 --> 03:31.541
Ooh, you redecorated!
Love the statement wall.

03:31.625 --> 03:35.083
No, Pugsley,
that's the <i>fourth</i> wall.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.750
Maybe that's the exit?

03:43.291 --> 03:47.000
Barney, come back!
No! Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.

03:58.291 --> 03:59.208
Ouch!

03:59.291 --> 04:02.333
There's a good reason
they don't make clothes out of metal.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.541
This is another one of Pauline's movies.

04:04.625 --> 04:07.333
I am not
an unreasonable Queen,

04:07.416 --> 04:09.750
despite what
my many enemies would tell you,

04:09.833 --> 04:12.625
but they can't, because they're all dead.

04:13.208 --> 04:16.500
She never really
got the hang of that accent, did she?

04:17.250 --> 04:18.875
-Silence!

04:18.958 --> 04:24.416
If you can defeat Sir Spheroid in battle,
then you may have my daughter's hand.

04:25.791 --> 04:27.708
I am not a prize to be won.

04:27.791 --> 04:30.416
Unless you're hot, or rich.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.875
Or hot and rich.

04:31.958 --> 04:33.750
Uh… Huh?

04:51.875 --> 04:52.916
Norma?

04:53.000 --> 04:56.708
That's <i>Sir</i> Spheroid to you, swine.

05:05.458 --> 05:08.000
Oh, what fun!

05:08.083 --> 05:09.708
Avoid the sword!

05:09.791 --> 05:13.125
Thanks for the tip, Pugsley.
We gotta change the channel!

05:17.541 --> 05:20.583
My hair! My beautiful hair!

05:23.000 --> 05:24.666
Ahh! Barney!

05:27.583 --> 05:31.208
No! My hot and rich suitor!

05:33.000 --> 05:35.833
Come back!

05:41.333 --> 05:43.541
Oh. <i>Dynamite Doris.</i>

05:43.625 --> 05:46.125
This is like the only Pauline movie
I've seen.

05:46.208 --> 05:49.041
You be
saying something, Justifer Jones?

05:49.125 --> 05:53.083
Oh, hey Pauline!
I was just saying I love this movie.

05:53.166 --> 05:57.291
You be saying something,
Justifer Jones?

05:58.083 --> 05:59.666
Creepy.

05:59.750 --> 06:04.458
Maybe if I play along and get to the end
of the movie, we can escape?

06:04.541 --> 06:05.666
Worth a shot.

06:07.250 --> 06:10.750
You be saying something…
Justifer Jones?

06:10.833 --> 06:14.833
I ain't got nothing
to say to the likes of you, Doris.

06:17.333 --> 06:20.750
You've got some nerve
showing your pretty little face here.

06:20.833 --> 06:25.916
As those there mountains are my witness,
I will put you away someday.

06:29.166 --> 06:31.750
Wow, I am good at this.

06:31.833 --> 06:35.916
Now, if I remember,
the first guy she kills is the sheriff.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.416
Hey, Sheriff, you ready to order?

06:40.666 --> 06:43.416
-Oh.

06:48.583 --> 06:52.500
Well, look at you, Alligator Anderson.

06:52.583 --> 06:56.083
-Alligator Anderson.
-Alligator Anderson?

07:03.375 --> 07:06.041
So you found me, Alligator.

07:06.125 --> 07:10.291
Ya came to my bar,
you wanted to be found.

07:16.375 --> 07:19.041
Now, now!
There's to be no fighting in my bar,

07:19.125 --> 07:20.916
or you'll both be out on your behinds.

07:22.666 --> 07:24.833
Norma, please wake up.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.916
Stop!

07:46.541 --> 07:48.791
Oh, right, blanks.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.458
It's just a movie.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.750
Oh, well, I'll be!

07:54.833 --> 07:57.291
That sure is some sharp shooting, ladies.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.333
Oh! Oh, oh!

08:01.416 --> 08:04.500
Let me just go fetch my tombstone.

08:05.666 --> 08:07.750
Come on, we have to get out of here.

08:07.833 --> 08:12.166
I'll get that Dynamite Doris
if it's the last thing I do.

08:14.541 --> 08:17.583
Hey, why you be acting
so foolish like just…

08:17.666 --> 08:18.500
Ouch!

08:18.583 --> 08:21.125
Courtney, we need to wake up Norma
and get out of here!

08:21.208 --> 08:23.708
But things
are just getting good in there.

08:23.791 --> 08:26.625
Argh! And where's Pugsley?

08:26.708 --> 08:27.791
Here.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.583
Please don't laugh.

08:34.625 --> 08:37.916
Come on. It's not funny,
I'm scared of heights!

08:50.166 --> 08:51.291
That's the way out!

08:52.458 --> 08:55.166
-Whoa, whoa. Hey, who said you could--

08:55.250 --> 08:56.458
Wait, what about Norma?

09:00.375 --> 09:02.625
She's having the time of her life! Go!

09:22.791 --> 09:26.250
-<i>Previously on</i> Dr. Love…
-Huh?

09:26.333 --> 09:28.791
Come on, wake up!

09:28.875 --> 09:30.875
Wake up my patients?

09:30.958 --> 09:32.375
Doctor Reverend Harvard,

09:32.458 --> 09:37.000
you may be a doctor and a reverend,
and a world-famous tightrope walker,

09:37.083 --> 09:41.250
but I cannot let my feelings for you
interfere with my job.

09:41.333 --> 09:45.416
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to perform emergency surgery

09:45.500 --> 09:49.291
on an astronaut who is also my ex-twin.

09:55.708 --> 09:59.625
Why can I cure every heart…
except my own?

10:01.750 --> 10:03.791
Why did I have to get this role?

10:03.875 --> 10:05.291
-You wanna swap?

10:05.375 --> 10:08.083
Norma, you're awake!
I-I-I mean, double awake.

10:08.166 --> 10:11.250
Uh… Oh!
The bright lights!

10:11.333 --> 10:14.666
I feel myself fading away <i>again.</i>

10:14.750 --> 10:19.083
Going back to my seven-year-long coma.

10:19.166 --> 10:20.916
That's terrible acting.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.125
Come on, Norma,
you know you're on TV? Since when?

10:24.208 --> 10:25.833
Ugh, since <i>Dead End.</i>

10:25.916 --> 10:28.500
I figured it out.
I figured it out straight away.

10:28.583 --> 10:32.375
What? But you tried to kill me, twice!

10:32.458 --> 10:34.458
You don't understand!

10:34.541 --> 10:37.833
Hey, wait! Courtney, come on!

10:37.916 --> 10:40.833
Oh, but I like it here.

10:40.916 --> 10:44.666
They have great snacks.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.041
Move!

10:52.458 --> 10:56.166
I am Troglodytey,
Queen of the Cave Women.

10:56.250 --> 10:59.083
And as punishment
for entering our kingdom,

10:59.166 --> 11:01.125
you are sentenced to death…

11:01.208 --> 11:03.083
Norma, you have to listen to me.

11:03.166 --> 11:06.250
-…by Diplo-duckus.

11:17.791 --> 11:20.458
Norma, you can't keep running away!

11:20.541 --> 11:21.958
Yes, I can!

11:22.041 --> 11:26.416
Great job. Keep it up, everyone.
Now, reach for the stars.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.333
This is doing amazing things for my core.

11:29.416 --> 11:30.875
Glad you're having fun,

11:30.958 --> 11:32.875
but can you actually help us, maybe?

11:32.958 --> 11:37.791
This is human business, mushy stuff.
I'm keeping my distance.

11:37.875 --> 11:41.958
I'm hearing a lot of "can't" out there,
but not a lot of "can-can-can"!

11:42.041 --> 11:45.250
What's wrong, Norma?
Why don't you want to go back?

11:45.333 --> 11:49.083
Because when we go back,
everything will be different.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.583
She'll be different.

11:50.666 --> 11:54.416
What, Pauline?
But the real Pauline is out there.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.416
We have to stop her. Wait!

11:58.375 --> 12:00.041
Whoa!

12:00.125 --> 12:02.083
<i>You be saying something, Justifer Jones?</i>

12:02.166 --> 12:03.375
<i>Wake up my patients?</i>

12:03.458 --> 12:05.000
<i>Oh, what fun!</i>

12:05.083 --> 12:07.250
<i>You're not supposed to be here!</i>

12:07.333 --> 12:08.583
<i>Just keep it to yourselves, darling.</i>

12:08.666 --> 12:10.500
<i>…are sentenced to death!</i>

12:18.333 --> 12:20.916
What? Back here again?

12:25.833 --> 12:26.791
Norma…

12:27.333 --> 12:28.541
Save it, Barney.

12:29.833 --> 12:33.291
Norma, we have to go back.
We need to stop Pauline.

12:33.375 --> 12:36.500
No, you go. I'm staying here.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.708
But none of this is real.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.833
So what? Look at me, Barney!

12:40.916 --> 12:44.291
I'm Patience Bonaparte,
the lady of Dead End!

12:44.375 --> 12:48.000
I can stay here forever with Pauline.
With my Pauline.

12:48.583 --> 12:51.416
Not that thing from the museum.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.208
I can be whoever she needs me to be.

12:56.958 --> 12:58.625
You know, it's pretty cool

12:58.708 --> 13:02.083
to see the house like this,
in its original glory.

13:02.166 --> 13:03.875
I love this house too.

13:03.958 --> 13:07.583
I chose it as my hiding place,
just like you.

13:07.666 --> 13:09.416
But it doesn't work.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.666
In the end,
you can't hide from your demons.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.666
I don't care
if you hide from me.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.000
I see enough of your dumb face all ready.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.375
Not now, Courtney.

13:19.458 --> 13:22.333
Ugh! Not now, Courtney.

13:22.958 --> 13:27.083
You could stay here
and be all these other people,

13:27.166 --> 13:30.000
or come back and be Norma Khan.

13:30.083 --> 13:32.750
I don't know anyone else
who has defeated a fear demon

13:32.833 --> 13:34.833
or stopped an army of zombie mascots,

13:34.916 --> 13:38.458
or even rewrote
the park's guidebook from scratch.

13:38.541 --> 13:40.875
Well, it was a bit uninspired,

13:40.958 --> 13:43.875
and the Russian translation
was really lacking.

13:43.958 --> 13:47.083
Exactly! Not even Pauline
has done those things.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.166
It's working.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.208
Come on, let's go.

14:15.625 --> 14:18.625
Before we go back,
there's one more thing I need to see.

14:21.958 --> 14:25.291
By the way, you were amazing
as Patience Bonaparte.

14:25.375 --> 14:26.750
I'm glad you noticed.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.250
This is bogus, Pauline.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.958
Why hire a stunt woman
when you can do your own stunts?

14:34.041 --> 14:37.250
I hardly consider
sitting on a swing a stunt, Barbara.

14:37.333 --> 14:40.625
It's Barborah. I'm just worried about you.

14:40.708 --> 14:43.875
Every time you do your own stunts,
something goes wrong.

14:43.958 --> 14:48.083
I'm just saying because I care about you,
and because…

14:48.166 --> 14:49.375
Yes?

14:49.458 --> 14:52.000
You're not as young as you used to be.

14:52.083 --> 14:56.583
Oh, is that so? Then why I still getting
all these leading-lady roles, hmm?

14:56.666 --> 14:59.083
This is a life insurance commercial.

14:59.166 --> 15:03.708
Excuse me! I will have you know
that this ad is for the trendiest,

15:03.791 --> 15:06.541
most fly life insurance on the market.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.833
I can do this myself!

15:08.916 --> 15:10.833
Fine! It's your funeral!

15:15.041 --> 15:18.125
This world is lame.
Let's go back to the morgue.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.291
Okay, everyone, places.

15:20.375 --> 15:24.000
Samsara Mutual,
Pauline Phoenix Spirit Package, take one.

15:24.083 --> 15:25.333
Action!

15:25.416 --> 15:26.833
You love your family.

15:26.916 --> 15:30.750
You make sure they wear their seatbelts
and wash their food before they eat it,

15:30.833 --> 15:33.458
so why are you selfishly
leaving them with nothing

15:33.541 --> 15:35.541
when you inevitably die?

15:35.625 --> 15:38.708
It could happen any day now
and you haven't planned for it at all

15:38.791 --> 15:43.500
because you are a bad person
who only thinks of yourself.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.208
But not me,

15:45.291 --> 15:48.208
because I've signed up
to the Spirit Package

15:59.416 --> 16:01.416
you'll get more
for those you leave behind,

16:01.500 --> 16:04.291
because no one lives forever.

16:04.791 --> 16:06.750
Not even star…

16:07.541 --> 16:11.375
Cut! Cut, cut! Pauline!

16:18.333 --> 16:21.250
-No!
-Pauline! Wait, where is she?

16:21.333 --> 16:22.500
Oh, my camera!

16:25.958 --> 16:29.125
Pauline! Pauline, no!

16:29.208 --> 16:32.958
Pauline, please,
please wake up. Please!

16:33.041 --> 16:34.916
What?

16:47.708 --> 16:49.833
Not bad.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.666
Shame about the teeth.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.000
Pauline,
dear, are you okay?

16:55.083 --> 16:57.791
I'm fine! Just a scratch.

16:58.625 --> 17:01.291
No one will ever see this…

17:01.375 --> 17:02.583
tape.

17:15.416 --> 17:19.458
We're back at the museum,
but the ghost is gone.

17:19.541 --> 17:20.958
How long were we in there?

17:21.041 --> 17:25.625
We just saw Pauline die.
Like really, really die.

17:25.708 --> 17:28.250
And judging by
that "radical ad" soundtrack,

17:28.333 --> 17:30.416
like, 30 years ago.

17:30.500 --> 17:34.958
Pauline's ghost possessed Barborah,
and once she was done with her,

17:35.041 --> 17:37.541
<i>she kept possessing</i>
<i>more and more look-alikes…</i>

17:39.291 --> 17:42.708
Staying young forever,
and keeping her career alive.

17:43.416 --> 17:45.416
And Jennifer was her latest victim.

17:56.083 --> 17:59.916
But if Jennifer's free now,
Pauline needs a new body.

18:00.416 --> 18:01.750
Who's gonna be next?

18:02.375 --> 18:05.250
Hey, Norma,
Pauline is way cooler than I thought.

18:05.333 --> 18:07.791
I get why you're so obsessed with her now.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.625
Maybe I'll join the fan club.

18:09.708 --> 18:11.166
She's been using us.

18:11.250 --> 18:15.375
Using her fans. Lying to us all!

18:16.125 --> 18:18.666
Yeah. Like I said, cool, right?

18:18.750 --> 18:20.250
Courtney, this isn't a joke.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.166
I'm not joking! It's a clever plan!

18:23.250 --> 18:26.250
Using human stupidity
and trust against them,

18:26.333 --> 18:29.708
her idiot fans lapping up every word.

18:32.291 --> 18:34.750
I can't believe anyone would be so dumb.

18:37.125 --> 18:39.083
-Norma?
-Huh?

18:39.166 --> 18:40.541
-Whoa!

18:40.625 --> 18:42.500
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, little buddy!

18:42.583 --> 18:44.916
Easy there. I'm just messing around.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.458
You love it when I do that.

18:46.541 --> 18:50.166
A human is upset, so you need to back off!

18:50.875 --> 18:52.291
A human?

18:52.375 --> 18:57.041
Oh, right, because you still see me
as less than you, don't you?

18:57.125 --> 19:00.291
I didn't know this was
a secret human-only club!

19:00.375 --> 19:02.625
Humans and dogs.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.041
You keep your distance
with mushy human stuff.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.708
We don't need you right now.

19:06.791 --> 19:08.833
-Oh, when do you ever need me?

19:08.916 --> 19:10.916
Fine! I'm out of here.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.875
Don't try to stop me!

19:14.958 --> 19:15.916
We're not.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.750
Well, that's fine with me.

19:24.833 --> 19:28.208
You guys are exhausting with
all your dumb emotions and friendships.

19:28.291 --> 19:31.208
You almost tricked me into feeling
all that soppy stuff too,

19:31.291 --> 19:33.083
but you know what? It didn't work.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.750
It didn't work.

19:38.291 --> 19:41.791
She's right.
I'm just another idiot fan.

19:46.041 --> 19:49.041
We have to stop her,
before she possesses someone else.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.875
-Hey, it's them, the traitors!

19:56.625 --> 19:59.916
Banned for life?
She turned the whole park against us!

20:04.333 --> 20:07.541
Stupid humans with their stupid problems.

20:07.625 --> 20:10.708
It's not my fault that
she was obsessed with that…

20:10.791 --> 20:12.333
Pauline?

20:12.416 --> 20:14.208
Tough day, puddin'?

20:14.291 --> 20:17.750
Uh, why are you here, talking to me?

20:17.833 --> 20:21.916
Ha! You see, I seem to have
misplaced my last body,

20:22.000 --> 20:23.458
and I'm in need of a new one.

20:23.541 --> 20:27.208
Jennifer, lovely girl, but she didn't
quite have the staying power.

20:27.291 --> 20:31.291
Good for you, but if you don't mind,
I was brooding.

20:32.208 --> 20:33.750
And I know why.

20:33.833 --> 20:37.583
Those meddling brats don't appreciate you.

20:37.666 --> 20:40.416
But I do. I'm your biggest fan.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.958
The way you sealed that Demon King
inside that little doggie,

20:44.041 --> 20:46.666
oh, why, that's talent, Red.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.875
I've been watching you for a while now,

20:48.958 --> 20:51.291
and I think there's a way
we can help each other.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.833
Ugh, what could you
possibly offer me in return?

20:55.416 --> 20:58.541
I don't know,
maybe a little trip on the elevator.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.666
You could do that?
You could send me home?

21:01.750 --> 21:05.750
Come on.
This is Phoenix Park, sweetie.

21:05.833 --> 21:08.458
Who do you think installed the darn thing?

21:09.375 --> 21:11.750
It's a deal.
