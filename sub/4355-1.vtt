WEBVTT

00:31.658 --> 00:33.451
That was seismic magnitude 9.8.

00:34.411 --> 00:35.662
We're at the end.

00:35.829 --> 00:39.582
Your egg is set, Lara.
All I have to do is add my genetic code.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.543
Just one fingerprint. Aah!

00:46.005 --> 00:47.674
Zod.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.010
An incubator pod.

00:51.177 --> 00:52.721
So the rumors were true.

00:55.181 --> 00:57.350
You should not have opposed me, Jor-El.

00:57.517 --> 01:01.062
I still can't believe
you allied with those dolts on the council.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.189
We could have ruled Krypton.

01:03.356 --> 01:05.567
You've destroyed this planet.

01:05.734 --> 01:07.652
I was given insufficient data.

01:07.819 --> 01:10.321
I told you. We all told you.

01:10.488 --> 01:12.407
Shut up. Shut up!

01:12.574 --> 01:13.950
Zod, please.

01:16.703 --> 01:19.330
I had a war machine to operate.

01:19.497 --> 01:21.166
My army needed the energy.

01:21.332 --> 01:24.461
We had to drill.
Your numbers were inconclusive, useless.

01:24.627 --> 01:28.173
I had the vision. I had the will.

01:30.717 --> 01:33.762
If anyone's seed is going to be spread
to the heavens...

01:34.679 --> 01:37.140
...it will be mine.

01:37.432 --> 01:39.267
You should feel honored, Lara.

01:41.144 --> 01:44.397
Upon your egg I bestow my eminence.

01:44.814 --> 01:48.067
Ours will be the last child of Krypton.

02:02.957 --> 02:07.420
Go. Make the universe feel your might.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.787
- What was in it?
- We don't know, Mr. Luthor.

04:45.954 --> 04:48.247
The farmer said it was open
when he found it.

04:48.414 --> 04:49.624
Search the area.

04:49.791 --> 04:53.628
I want the ship taken to S.T.A.R. Labs.
Code Black, sergeant.

04:53.795 --> 04:56.089
None of this gets out.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.221
Knock, knock.

05:46.097 --> 05:47.932
How long has this been down here?

05:48.099 --> 05:49.142
Too long.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.019
<i>Superman.</i>

05:51.185 --> 05:53.021
Superman, where are you?

05:53.187 --> 05:54.313
<i>Mr. Trevor.</i>

05:54.480 --> 05:57.316
<i>What raid would be complete
without your cautionary tones?</i>

05:57.483 --> 05:59.902
<i>We found their bunker.
Under the Kasnian embassy.</i>

06:00.069 --> 06:02.363
Don't do anything until we get there.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.991
<i>Hear me? Stay back.</i>

06:10.705 --> 06:13.041
We disappoint again.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.420
Send it now.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.733
Unh!

07:25.655 --> 07:27.323
Unh.

07:41.754 --> 07:43.005
Hurry, goddamn it.

08:15.872 --> 08:17.206
Unh.

08:25.965 --> 08:27.091
Jesus.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.600
The cavalry arrives.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.852
Too bad the movie's over.

08:38.019 --> 08:39.395
Nice little bloodbath.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.397
Was this really necessary?

08:41.563 --> 08:44.150
They got rambunctious.

08:44.317 --> 08:46.360
You realize this is embassy property?

08:46.527 --> 08:48.905
Technically,
it's off-limits to law enforcement.

08:49.071 --> 08:50.656
Technically, we're not the police.

08:50.823 --> 08:53.826
Don't get wise with me.
The old lady's not gonna like this.

08:53.993 --> 08:56.787
What are you talking about?
She'll be positively orgasmic.

08:56.954 --> 09:00.416
She gets her stolen files back,
plus a couple of dozen wanted terrorists...

09:00.583 --> 09:02.001
...wanted no more.

09:02.168 --> 09:04.503
She'll think it's Christmas.

09:09.634 --> 09:11.594
Get me the president.

09:11.761 --> 09:13.638
And a mop.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.681
<i>JL, like hell. JL, like hell.</i>

09:15.848 --> 09:18.601
These are aliens and inhumans
watching over us.

09:18.768 --> 09:20.561
Who's watching over them?

09:20.728 --> 09:25.149
For the Bible sayeth, "I am the Lord your God.
You shall have no other gods before me."

09:25.316 --> 09:28.486
Fangs for sale. Batman fangs.
Wonder swords.

09:28.653 --> 09:32.490
<i>JL, like hell. JL, like hell.</i>

09:32.657 --> 09:34.909
Don't they ever shut up?

09:35.076 --> 09:37.912
<i>--at least 50 dead in the embassy massacre.</i>

09:38.079 --> 09:42.375
<i>And not just dead. Dismembered, burnt alive,
sucked of their blood.</i>

09:42.541 --> 09:44.835
<i>A virtual house of horrors.</i>

09:45.002 --> 09:48.089
<i>Granted, the victims were part
of a terrorist organization...</i>

09:48.256 --> 09:50.258
Wondered when you'd mention that.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.593
<i>...but what about our terrorist organization?</i>

09:52.760 --> 09:54.845
<i>What about the Justice League?</i>

09:55.012 --> 09:57.515
<i>It's not like we haven't been warned.</i>

09:57.682 --> 10:01.227
<i>What the government has sanctioned
is more than a super SWAT team.</i>

10:01.394 --> 10:05.231
<i>It's a weapon of absolute power,
and we all know where that leads.</i>

10:05.398 --> 10:09.860
<i>Sooner or later, the ties between the Oval Office
and the tower of so-called justice...</i>

10:10.361 --> 10:14.115
<i>...will finally fray,
and then who will be in control?</i>

10:14.282 --> 10:16.742
Not you, buddy. Not anymore.

10:18.119 --> 10:19.745
Why do you even listen?

10:20.246 --> 10:21.289
They hate us.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.083
Don't let the crowds down there fool you,
Bekka.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.585
They are not <i>la gente comÃºn...</i>

10:26.794 --> 10:28.379
...the real people.

10:28.546 --> 10:32.508
There are many who would like nothing more
than for us to take over. Tell her, Kirk.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.928
Twenty-two percent domestically,
29 percent worldwide.

10:36.095 --> 10:37.930
Revolutions have been built on less.

10:38.097 --> 10:42.601
Imagine ending all the ideological squabbling.
No more war, no more insurrections.

10:42.768 --> 10:47.189
All those little dots down there
connected to a single productive purpose.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.859
A world brought together as one.

10:50.026 --> 10:53.362
- Under us?
- Under us.

10:54.030 --> 10:56.282
You just got less sexy.

10:56.449 --> 10:59.994
I'm not saying I would, but things aren't
getting any easier with Washington.

11:00.161 --> 11:03.456
And the day may be fast coming
when we'll have to consider our options.

11:03.622 --> 11:06.959
The new world order
will have to wait. Your appointment's here.

11:07.126 --> 11:09.420
- Who'd you get this time?
- Silas Stone.

11:09.587 --> 11:12.465
<i>One of the most brilliant men on the planet.</i>

11:19.847 --> 11:22.016
Dr. Stone.

11:22.224 --> 11:25.144
- You move quickly.
- I'm eager to get to work...

11:25.394 --> 11:26.854
...if you're ready.

11:31.150 --> 11:33.819
Don't be nervous.
Think of it as a grand adventure.

11:40.326 --> 11:41.660
<i>Vic, are you there?</i>

11:41.827 --> 11:42.912
Yeah, Hank. What's up?

11:43.079 --> 11:45.456
<i>The storm front's coming in
faster than expected.</i>

11:45.623 --> 11:46.957
<i>You'd better get back here.</i>

11:47.124 --> 11:49.460
Warm up the brandy.
I've got one reading left.

11:56.801 --> 11:57.885
What the hell?

12:29.333 --> 12:31.585
Aah! Unh!

13:10.207 --> 13:12.793
Thought you'd get away, huh?

13:12.960 --> 13:17.089
I only wish I could be there when the senate
committee gets a load of this pony show.

13:17.256 --> 13:20.009
I just finished my speech this afternoon.

13:20.176 --> 13:25.973
"Molecular Miniaturization:
A big idea for a shrinking world."

13:28.809 --> 13:31.145
I don't think you'll have to say much,
Dr. Palmer.

13:31.312 --> 13:32.396
Thanks, Ryan.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.082
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

13:52.249 --> 13:55.419
It's your husband. Remember how
you wanted stables in the backyard?

13:55.628 --> 13:59.215
We might have the room after all.
Call me back.

13:59.381 --> 14:00.799
Aah! Unh!

14:32.957 --> 14:34.959
Aah. Aah!

15:34.101 --> 15:37.229
<i>Every time I call you,
your place looks gloomier and gloomier.</i>

15:37.396 --> 15:38.981
<i>Couldn't you brighten it up, Kirk?</i>

15:39.148 --> 15:42.109
Even in college you had those
god-awful Beastie Boy posters.

15:42.276 --> 15:43.736
Tell him to put up some drapes.

15:43.902 --> 15:47.072
Drapes? How about some windows?

15:47.239 --> 15:48.324
<i>Is that Tina?</i>

15:48.490 --> 15:50.034
How's my favorite bat guy?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.119
<i>Cooking up a batch of fake plasma.</i>

15:52.286 --> 15:53.454
Yum.

15:53.621 --> 15:55.456
Thank you.

15:56.498 --> 15:57.958
Don't get married, Kirk.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.711
Wives will protect the life out of you.

16:00.919 --> 16:03.797
<i>No worries.
I've pretty much given up on eHarmony.</i>

16:03.964 --> 16:07.718
Listen, I want you to know
I'm not having luck with the latest tests.

16:07.885 --> 16:11.388
Every time I try to reverse the antigen,
the cellular walls don't hold.

16:11.555 --> 16:12.890
<i>I didn't think they would.</i>

16:13.057 --> 16:15.684
Don't give up hope.
We'll figure out a cure for you.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.770
What was made can be unmade.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.813
Thanks, Tin.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.066
- It just....
<i>- Takes time.</i>

16:22.483 --> 16:25.694
Yeah. But that's not why I called.

16:25.861 --> 16:29.448
You must've heard Ray Palmer's missing.
His truck was totaled.

16:29.615 --> 16:32.993
Poor Jean.
She's been calling Tina 10 times a day.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.663
<i>That's upstate, Will. Not my jurisdiction.</i>

16:35.954 --> 16:38.457
Since when does the Justice League
have a jurisdiction?

16:38.624 --> 16:40.376
Come on, Kirk. It's Ray.

16:40.918 --> 16:44.546
<i>I'll check into it, but it's not gonna win me
any friends with the local cops.</i>

16:44.713 --> 16:47.716
So? People don't like you anyway.

16:48.676 --> 16:50.302
<i>Good point.</i>

17:01.605 --> 17:04.191
One more micro booster
and I could take out a tank.

17:04.358 --> 17:07.653
- Now will you tell me?
- I told you everything.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.948
Come on, Dad. What was he like?
What'd he say?

17:11.240 --> 17:13.200
He was tall.

17:13.492 --> 17:18.454
Oh, jeez. I know what he looks like.
Weren't you freaked? He's a killer alien.

17:18.622 --> 17:21.375
Dude could've hurt you
just by looking at you real hard.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.085
He was very matter-of-fact.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.380
He said he had a job for me,
and I'm doing it.

17:26.547 --> 17:28.924
- Which is?
- Can't say.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.468
But I did see Wonder Woman.

17:31.635 --> 17:34.805
Tell me. Tell me. And don't say she was tall.

17:35.597 --> 17:38.267
- She was-- Aah!
- Unh.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.191
The hell's that?

17:49.653 --> 17:50.988
Run!

17:54.533 --> 17:56.243
Go!

18:32.905 --> 18:33.947
Oh, sh--

18:45.918 --> 18:47.836
So, what brings the feds?

18:48.003 --> 18:52.382
Mr. Stone worked for the military, Ms. Lane.
This is purely routine.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.384
That a fact?

19:00.974 --> 19:02.559
I want a look around.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.979
I don't suppose I could dissuade you.
This is a crime scene.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.398
I won't touch a thing.

19:09.817 --> 19:13.278
- Your boyfriend has a lot of nerve.
- He's not my boyfriend.

19:13.445 --> 19:15.239
And, yes, he does.

19:28.210 --> 19:31.588
Only the police are allowed
beyond the yellow tape, Ms. Lane.

19:31.755 --> 19:34.091
I don't see your badge.

19:35.050 --> 19:38.178
Good one.
Think your logic will persuade this guy?

19:39.888 --> 19:42.683
- Yeah.
<i>- Stone isn't our only dead scientist.</i>

19:42.850 --> 19:45.394
<i>How fast can you get back here?</i>

19:46.520 --> 19:49.064
This is Victor Fries, the thermal expert.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.149
Nobel and Kyoto prizes.

19:51.316 --> 19:55.821
He was measuring atmospheric carbon levels
near the Arctic Circle three days ago.

19:55.988 --> 19:58.991
They found his body
at the bottom of a ravine.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.118
It wasn't the fall that killed him though.

20:01.869 --> 20:06.874
His carotid artery was severed,
presumably by the ice he hit on the way down.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.794
- He bled to death?
- Yes, except they can't find the blood.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.755
There should've been
a pool of frozen blood around the neck.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.841
Maybe as much as a half-quart.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.426
It's not there.

20:17.593 --> 20:19.428
This is Ray Palmer's truck.

20:19.595 --> 20:22.097
It was found a couple of days ago
at the bottom of a hill.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.516
It appears to have been sliced up.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.685
But that's not the most intriguing damage.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.772
A boot print, as if the truck was kicked.

20:30.939 --> 20:34.151
The size is rather diminutive
and has a pronounced heel.

20:34.318 --> 20:35.360
A woman.

20:35.527 --> 20:38.488
So it would seem.
They haven't found Palmer's body yet...

20:38.655 --> 20:41.199
...but no one's expecting him
to show up at the office.

20:41.783 --> 20:45.329
And here's where you just came from,
what remains of Stone's lab.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.247
I put it through some filters.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.876
The streaks and spotting are hot spots
where the fire started.

20:51.043 --> 20:54.546
It's as if someone went through Stone's lab
with a pair of blowtorches.

20:54.713 --> 20:56.131
Or heat vision.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.300
Yes, I thought that might occur to you.

20:58.467 --> 21:00.761
Ha. We're being framed.

21:00.928 --> 21:03.430
Someone's actually trying to frame
the Justice League.

21:03.597 --> 21:05.307
Who would have the balls?

21:05.474 --> 21:08.560
It's not gonna be long
before the police start putting it together.

21:08.727 --> 21:09.895
Maybe they already have.

21:10.062 --> 21:12.397
You can bet someone's gonna
leak it to the press.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.900
Anything connect these scientists?

21:15.067 --> 21:17.235
They all worked together
at one time or another.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.905
Government projects. Usually top-secret.

21:20.072 --> 21:22.699
Stone was a visiting professor
at Gotham University.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.826
I thought I'd check out his files.

21:25.452 --> 21:28.413
You still friendly with Trevor?
He might be useful.

21:28.580 --> 21:29.748
He often was.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.334
Stay on top of him.

21:32.542 --> 21:33.877
You know what I mean.

21:34.044 --> 21:36.630
We've gotta get ahead of this thing,
that includes the media.

21:36.797 --> 21:41.259
Someone's trying to screw with us
and they're going to be damn sorry.

21:58.110 --> 21:59.528
"Fair Play."

22:03.198 --> 22:06.785
"Fries. Palmer. Stone.

22:06.952 --> 22:08.912
Magnus."

22:25.679 --> 22:27.431
Luthor's boys.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.435
That's it.

22:31.977 --> 22:35.772
Remember, you are the best
your generation has to offer.

22:35.939 --> 22:39.401
Do not squander your talents.
Be brazen. Be bold.

22:39.568 --> 22:40.944
The world needs change...

22:41.111 --> 22:43.864
...and you're among the few
who can make that happen.

22:44.031 --> 22:47.868
Wow, it's like getting a pep talk
from Einstein.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.037
You okay?

22:50.203 --> 22:52.372
I gotta finish my lab work.

22:52.831 --> 22:55.375
- You're coming to the party tonight?
- I guess.

22:55.542 --> 22:58.670
You're coming to the party tonight.

22:58.837 --> 22:59.880
Okay.

23:00.047 --> 23:02.632
You don't wanna make Tina mad.
You know how she gets.

23:05.385 --> 23:06.553
I'll be there.

23:06.720 --> 23:10.432
You know, sometimes I wonder
why we even try.

23:31.828 --> 23:34.331
- Wake up, sleepyhead.
- Ah--

23:34.664 --> 23:36.750
You're missing the party.

23:36.917 --> 23:39.252
Sorry, but I think I'm getting close
to something.

23:39.419 --> 23:42.130
The coefficient on the blood coagulants
is almost matching.

23:42.339 --> 23:45.092
Hey, get your ass up. We're late.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.636
I think I should stay.

23:47.803 --> 23:50.388
Kirk, can't it wait till tomorrow?

23:50.722 --> 23:53.016
What good's life if you don't live it?

23:53.183 --> 23:55.685
Put away the bat stats, just for one night.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.938
For me?

23:58.105 --> 23:59.689
- For you.
- Mm.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.567
Okay, that's enough convincing.
Let's move, move, move.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.778
Crazy Ivy's bringing her homegrown.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.207
Oh.

24:17.374 --> 24:20.252
Are you sure this is our place?
The key doesn't fit.

24:20.418 --> 24:22.379
Let me.

24:24.131 --> 24:26.550
It looks like our place.

24:26.716 --> 24:27.759
Smells like it.

24:29.636 --> 24:32.055
- You okay?
- Yeah, I feel fine.

24:32.222 --> 24:35.684
- I hope we didn't tire you out too much.
- Heads up.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.271
The couch.

24:39.938 --> 24:41.064
Uh-uh.

24:41.231 --> 24:42.607
What do you mean?

24:42.774 --> 24:45.902
Not tonight.
This designated driver is going home.

24:46.069 --> 24:50.532
But, baby, I'm the designated boyfriend.
You need to drive me. Come on.

24:50.699 --> 24:53.368
Oh, my God. This is your project, right?

24:53.535 --> 24:57.372
- The nanites?
- Yeah, I brought it home.

24:58.081 --> 24:59.875
Look how far they got.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.460
And they're still building it.

25:02.627 --> 25:06.423
Mm-hm. They replicate themselves.
Must be trillions by now.

25:06.590 --> 25:09.092
If you had a microscope,
you could see them.

25:09.259 --> 25:12.512
- They'll all be part of the ship when it's finished.
- What kind of metal?

25:12.679 --> 25:15.265
Iron. Lead. A little mercury.

25:15.432 --> 25:17.767
Could you do this with organics?

25:17.934 --> 25:19.227
Theoretically.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.271
What do you wanna build, a girlfriend?

25:21.438 --> 25:22.647
I'm serious.

25:22.814 --> 25:26.860
If you can program nanites this complex,
that could be the answer.

25:27.027 --> 25:29.362
The bat venom almost eradicates
the lymphoma...

25:29.529 --> 25:32.365
...but the cell structure breaks down
even as it forms.

25:32.949 --> 25:35.785
If we could program molecules
to secure the structure...

25:35.952 --> 25:38.872
...then we could stabilize the-- The--

25:42.459 --> 25:45.670
He's okay. Too much excitement, I think.

25:48.131 --> 25:52.886
Hello? Yes, we need an ambulance.
We have a friend. He's sick.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.390
You should have told us how bad it was.

25:57.557 --> 26:00.143
I didn't wanna bore you with the details.

26:00.310 --> 26:03.730
Seriously, Kirk, we're your friends.
We care about you.

26:04.105 --> 26:05.732
You really are close.

26:06.316 --> 26:09.986
I can't say I understand it all,
but I see what you mean about using nanotech.

26:10.362 --> 26:14.991
The medical solution takes you only so far.
You need an agent to patch it all in.

26:15.158 --> 26:17.327
- Is that my research?
- Yeah.

26:17.494 --> 26:18.828
How'd you get my password?

26:19.371 --> 26:22.082
"Batman"? Wasn't too hard.

26:22.249 --> 26:24.501
You know, I wouldn't mind
taking a stab at this.

26:24.668 --> 26:27.462
- You think it could work?
- Yeah. Maybe.

26:27.629 --> 26:31.424
I don't know. I mean,
how soon can you blow this pop stand?

26:31.883 --> 26:34.302
- Hand me my clothes.
- You sure you're well enough?

26:34.469 --> 26:36.012
I don't think he's well enough.

26:36.179 --> 26:40.600
He's not gonna get any better lying on his ass.
Anyway, school's over.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.936
We could use a science project.

26:43.770 --> 26:47.190
Mickey, Minnie and Mighty, rest in peace.

26:47.565 --> 26:50.527
A rodent nation salutes you.

26:53.113 --> 26:55.115
But you, Jerry, look at you.

26:55.282 --> 26:58.785
Five days and stronger than ever.
You're the mouse that scored.

26:58.952 --> 27:02.330
His erythrocyte count is still up.
Agglutination normal.

27:02.706 --> 27:04.165
I think you did it, Will.

27:04.332 --> 27:07.085
You laid the brick. I just plastered.

27:07.252 --> 27:10.505
- We could still use another test.
- No.

27:12.215 --> 27:13.842
You sure?

27:14.009 --> 27:16.720
- What are you doing?
- I don't have time for any more tests.

27:16.886 --> 27:19.723
If I go back to the hospital,
I'll lose this chance.

27:19.889 --> 27:22.142
- Will.
- Kirk, I don't know.

27:22.309 --> 27:24.477
We knew it was going to come down to this.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.062
Just look away.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.483
Jesus. Here.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.615
You better survive this, you bastard.

27:48.918 --> 27:50.795
Vincent Price movie, five letters.

27:50.962 --> 27:52.589
How can you do a crossword?

27:52.756 --> 27:55.133
I already did the sudoku.

27:55.592 --> 27:57.844
- How is he?
- The same.

27:59.262 --> 28:01.181
I wonder if you'd take such good care of me.

28:01.348 --> 28:03.308
Oh, God, Will, don't start that again.

28:05.018 --> 28:07.228
Kirk! Kirk, open up!

28:30.293 --> 28:32.504
Where's your fricking wallet, kid?

29:26.391 --> 29:29.936
Three scientists dead,
all working for the president.

29:30.228 --> 29:33.273
Must be pretty sensitive
if she sends in Steve Trevor.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.691
These were important men.

29:34.858 --> 29:37.777
The president wants to ensure
there were no security breaches.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.612
Then they were working for her.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.739
- On what?
- I never said that.

29:41.906 --> 29:44.868
<i>And would Mr. Trevor's investigation
include the Justice League?</i>

29:45.034 --> 29:46.411
Why would you even ask?

29:46.578 --> 29:50.415
I don't know if you've read the crime reports.
They have some nasty implications.

29:50.582 --> 29:52.750
And yesterday, who do I run into?

29:58.548 --> 30:00.550
I'll call you back.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.721
We meet again.

30:04.888 --> 30:06.181
Mind if I come in?

30:06.598 --> 30:08.766
By all means.

30:12.896 --> 30:14.230
Popular place.

30:14.647 --> 30:17.817
It's not often we get a strange visitor
from another planet.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.611
What brings you?

30:19.777 --> 30:23.781
The other day you asked me about my interest
in Silas Stone's death.

30:24.115 --> 30:26.409
The fact is, he was working for me.

30:26.576 --> 30:29.120
- On what?
- Something in the tower.

30:29.287 --> 30:30.872
I could show you if you'd like.

30:31.039 --> 30:33.124
You never let the press inside the tower.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.709
I'm reconsidering.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.878
Unless you'd rather not be the first.

30:37.045 --> 30:39.506
Like hell. Let's go.

30:39.714 --> 30:41.132
I'll give you a lift.

30:41.299 --> 30:44.969
Ha. Thanks, but I'll drive.

30:46.888 --> 30:49.265
The generators are Kryptonian designed.

30:49.432 --> 30:53.937
They not only power the building, but provide
a shield that makes it virtually impenetrable.

30:54.103 --> 30:59.025
My God, even the rumors about this place
don't do it justice.

31:09.827 --> 31:13.831
Here in the center of the tower
is the center of my life.

31:15.625 --> 31:17.835
The ship which brought me to Earth.

31:18.002 --> 31:19.754
The government used to have this.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.548
It was never theirs to keep.

31:21.714 --> 31:24.050
I asked for it back, they acquiesced.

31:24.217 --> 31:25.593
I'll bet they did.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.428
These are the ship's computer files.

31:27.637 --> 31:30.515
What little we know about Krypton,
we know from them.

31:30.682 --> 31:34.310
Unfortunately, the files were heavily damaged
during the ship's trek to Earth.

31:34.477 --> 31:37.355
The government hasn't been able
to recover much, neither have I.

31:37.647 --> 31:42.527
That's why I enlisted Professor Stone's help,
to see if he could retrieve the information.

31:42.694 --> 31:45.780
Right now, all we have
are the last moments on Krypton.

31:58.293 --> 32:01.421
- He looks like you.
- He's my biological father.

32:01.588 --> 32:02.797
There's a DNA record.

32:02.964 --> 32:06.092
From his uniform,
we think he was a high-ranking official...

32:06.259 --> 32:07.969
...undoubtedly brilliant.

32:08.136 --> 32:10.388
He must have known the end was coming.

32:10.555 --> 32:13.224
I'd like to think
if more people had listened to him...

32:13.391 --> 32:15.226
...he could've been the planet's savior.

32:15.393 --> 32:19.814
Is that how you see your role?
To save us? Or to rule us?

32:19.981 --> 32:22.442
I thought we were getting
beyond the sarcasm.

32:22.609 --> 32:25.445
Come on, Superman.
We both know what's going on here.

32:25.612 --> 32:27.864
This is straight-up spin control.

32:28.031 --> 32:32.035
Certain police reports are coming out
that are gonna make people wonder about you.

32:32.201 --> 32:37.290
So here I am getting the full court press
on the Man of Steel's human side...

32:37.457 --> 32:39.709
...if that's not an oxymoron.

32:39.876 --> 32:42.712
I wanted to reveal my world to you,
Miss Lane.

32:43.171 --> 32:44.672
Really?

32:44.839 --> 32:47.550
Wasn't Luthor the one
who extracted this footage?

32:47.717 --> 32:49.469
He never seemed impressed.

32:49.636 --> 32:52.347
Luthor was a frustrated elitist
whose influence was waning.

32:52.555 --> 32:53.848
I come from a simple people.

32:54.015 --> 32:57.393
I was raised by a migrant couple.
I've seen the harshness of life.

32:57.560 --> 33:01.230
If I deliver justice with a heavy hand,
it's because I've been on the receiving end.

33:01.397 --> 33:04.233
But I'm here when my country needs me.
And where's Lex Luthor?

33:04.400 --> 33:06.235
Gone. Absent.

33:07.362 --> 33:09.364
Excuse me.

33:09.739 --> 33:12.533
Sorry to interrupt, but there's a call.

33:19.374 --> 33:23.294
- You actually brought her.
- What a bitch.

33:23.461 --> 33:26.381
<i>Needless to say,
this is a conversation we never had.</i>

33:26.547 --> 33:28.383
<i>But I want you to know that forensics...</i>

33:28.549 --> 33:31.469
<i>...is further implicating the Justice League
in these murders.</i>

33:31.636 --> 33:33.554
What forensics exactly?

33:33.721 --> 33:35.890
<i>It's serious enough that I'm making this call.</i>

33:36.057 --> 33:40.353
<i>It might behoove you if the league volunteered
on their own to speak to the authorities.</i>

33:40.520 --> 33:43.690
I am speaking to the authorities.
I'm speaking to you.

33:43.856 --> 33:47.610
<i>Don't get heated with me, Superman.
I'm only trying to lessen the pressure.</i>

33:47.777 --> 33:51.447
<i>If things get difficult,
I won't be able to protect you.</i>

33:51.614 --> 33:53.241
Protect me from who?

33:53.408 --> 33:56.994
Who do you think protects whom here?

34:03.209 --> 34:04.919
Hello, Batman.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.922
Hello, Tin.
Is Professor Magnus available?

34:08.089 --> 34:10.216
What the hell's wrong with you?

34:10.382 --> 34:13.010
He's busy.

34:13.177 --> 34:16.097
They are all a bunch of cold-blooded killers.

34:16.264 --> 34:17.389
Not Kirk.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.059
He's a freaking vampire, for chrissakes.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.061
He only kills criminals.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.396
You're off base.

34:23.563 --> 34:26.232
Just because you're best buddies
doesn't mean you're safe.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.567
None of us are.

34:27.734 --> 34:30.235
If Fries and the others are on their list,
we all are.

34:30.402 --> 34:34.197
And I'm not just gonna sit around
and wait to see who's next.

34:40.204 --> 34:43.623
- You dropped by at an opportune time.
- Dr. Karen Beecher?

34:44.167 --> 34:48.004
Yeah. Two-hundred IQ.
Emotional IQ, not so high.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.672
Where did she put that pipe?

34:50.840 --> 34:52.216
What's the list she mentioned?

34:52.382 --> 34:56.679
She's under the impression the Justice League
is killing off America's greatest scientists.

34:56.846 --> 34:59.390
I informed her that was nonsense.

34:59.557 --> 35:02.143
- I hope I was right.
- What's her reason?

35:02.310 --> 35:04.353
She's a scientist. She sees patterns.

35:04.520 --> 35:07.315
- Aha!
- What aren't you telling me, Will?

35:07.482 --> 35:09.025
Come on, Kirk, you know the deal.

35:09.192 --> 35:11.861
You get hired, sign papers, keep secrets.

35:12.028 --> 35:16.574
But if I thought there was anything
you should know, I wouldn't hold back.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.869
What about Project Fair Play?

35:21.537 --> 35:22.872
How do you know about that?

35:23.039 --> 35:26.501
There was an e-mail in Silas Stone's files.
You're cc'd.

35:26.667 --> 35:29.253
It appears to be a program Luthor started.

35:29.420 --> 35:31.422
What does it have to do with this?

35:31.589 --> 35:33.424
Nothing, Kirk. Really.

35:33.591 --> 35:35.384
If I knew, I would tell you.

35:35.593 --> 35:36.886
I would.

35:42.767 --> 35:45.102
Kirk? What's going on?

35:45.269 --> 35:46.896
That's what I'd like to know.

35:47.396 --> 35:49.148
Your husband isn't much help.

35:49.315 --> 35:52.151
You know how Will is. So sure of himself.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.445
He can be too clever for his own good.

35:55.446 --> 35:57.114
I'm afraid.

35:57.281 --> 36:00.409
Don't worry.
I won't let anything happen to you...

36:00.576 --> 36:01.869
...or Will.

36:02.036 --> 36:04.914
- You either, Tin.
- Thank you, Batman.

36:06.123 --> 36:09.252
I'm worried about you too, Kirk.
I read the news.

36:09.418 --> 36:12.463
I worry you're in as much danger
as any of us.

36:13.256 --> 36:17.343
I know, the skin is cold,
but the heart's still warm.

36:35.403 --> 36:37.738
Looks like you could use a partner.

36:37.905 --> 36:39.574
I thought you'd grown tired of me.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.492
Not tired...

36:42.201 --> 36:44.161
...just restless.

36:46.163 --> 36:49.500
You don't fool me, Bekka.
I know why you're here.

36:49.667 --> 36:51.002
Which is?

36:51.168 --> 36:53.004
You wanna know what Forensics has.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.674
I can't tell you.

37:00.303 --> 37:01.971
How about a wager?

37:02.138 --> 37:04.348
I win, I get the information.

37:04.515 --> 37:08.060
You win, you get me.

37:11.105 --> 37:13.941
We both know you're 50 times stronger
than I am.

37:19.447 --> 37:21.657
Maybe we can both get what we want.

37:21.824 --> 37:25.828
- You think the big guy's gonna like that?
- I told you, he's not my boyfriend.

37:25.995 --> 37:29.540
- Unh!
- I belong to no man. Not Superman, not you.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.375
Unh!

37:35.338 --> 37:37.965
You belonged to someone once.

37:43.804 --> 37:45.973
I told you that in a moment of weakness.

37:46.140 --> 37:47.642
Bring it up again....

37:47.808 --> 37:50.102
All right, all right.

37:57.944 --> 38:01.739
Ray Palmer's body was found
slashed in half.

38:02.740 --> 38:05.701
They're pretty sure they've ID'd the weapon.

38:13.042 --> 38:16.879
For too long, Darkseid,
our worlds have been at war.

38:17.046 --> 38:22.051
And now, for the first time in a millennium,
we can lower our swords.

38:22.218 --> 38:27.181
Here's to our treaty
and the union which will seal our bond.

38:27.348 --> 38:30.601
The marriage between
my lovely granddaughter, Bekka...

38:30.768 --> 38:34.021
...and your steadfast son, Orion.

38:34.355 --> 38:38.901
In that same spirit,
I welcome you to Apokolips, Highfather.

38:39.068 --> 38:44.824
Tomorrow at this time,
we not only merge kingdoms, but families.

38:49.412 --> 38:52.748
It's a world of heathens and brutes, my child.

38:53.124 --> 38:56.752
History will praise your courage
and sacrifice.

38:56.919 --> 38:59.505
The boy seems different,
not like his family.

38:59.922 --> 39:02.133
More thoughtful.

39:02.299 --> 39:03.592
He made me uneasy.

39:03.926 --> 39:07.722
This is not the time to waver.
You have a world counting on you.

39:07.888 --> 39:09.682
Yes, I know.

39:10.850 --> 39:12.685
Then get some sleep.

39:12.852 --> 39:16.230
We have a momentous day ahead of us.

39:36.542 --> 39:39.336
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

39:39.503 --> 39:40.755
You're not supposed to.

39:40.921 --> 39:43.299
You're going to find out
I'm not much for rules.

39:43.591 --> 39:46.635
I also tend to get my way. Hop on.

39:46.802 --> 39:48.471
No, thank you.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.723
They told me you were a spitfire.

39:50.890 --> 39:52.558
You're not afraid, are you?

39:52.975 --> 39:54.727
I'm never afraid.

39:54.894 --> 39:56.353
Come with me.

39:57.021 --> 39:59.565
I have something I wanna show you.

40:04.195 --> 40:05.946
Better hold tighter than that.

40:06.113 --> 40:07.364
This is tight enough.

40:40.147 --> 40:43.109
I never knew Apokolips
could hold such beauty.

40:43.275 --> 40:45.361
This is my special spot.

40:45.528 --> 40:49.740
The one place in my world where
the skies open and you can see the stars.

40:49.907 --> 40:52.743
- This is where I come to think.
- About what?

40:52.910 --> 40:57.414
Life, honor, you.

40:57.748 --> 41:00.543
You and I are the only hope
for our worlds, Bekka...

41:00.709 --> 41:04.004
...but there will be treachery everywhere
and we must be prepared.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.007
It's for you.

41:07.174 --> 41:09.009
Open it.

41:12.930 --> 41:14.265
It's beautiful.

41:14.431 --> 41:17.226
The blade was forged
by our finest swordsmith.

41:17.393 --> 41:21.564
It's virtually indestructible,
but that's not the most impressive part.

41:21.730 --> 41:23.941
Inside the pommel is a Mother Box.

41:24.108 --> 41:27.528
It will take you anywhere you want to go.

41:28.863 --> 41:33.617
It is my wedding gift.
Keep it at your side always.

41:33.784 --> 41:36.662
The sword will protect you when I cannot.

41:52.803 --> 41:57.183
By sacred powers invoked
from beyond the source wall...

41:57.349 --> 42:01.937
...I now declare your spirits as one.

42:25.961 --> 42:27.713
Come, let's go.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.050
- Bekka.
- It's over.

42:31.217 --> 42:33.177
We can be together.

42:43.812 --> 42:47.233
- No!
- It can't be stopped.

42:49.693 --> 42:50.736
Aah!

43:10.589 --> 43:13.175
You should have gone with her, boy.

43:30.442 --> 43:32.319
You said he could live.

43:32.486 --> 43:36.699
I said I would spare him for you,
but not at the expense of the mission.

43:36.865 --> 43:40.577
Even if he had lived,
what life could you have had with him?

43:40.744 --> 43:42.162
He was different.

43:42.329 --> 43:43.789
He was Darkseid's blood.

43:43.956 --> 43:49.044
One of countless bastards
in a line of endless betrayal.

43:50.879 --> 43:54.174
You are one to speak.
You are blood-soaked in betrayal.

43:54.341 --> 43:55.843
Watch your tongue, granddaughter.

43:56.010 --> 43:58.429
If I had to do it over,
I would have warned them all.

43:58.595 --> 44:00.389
I would have shouted to the skies:

44:00.556 --> 44:03.767
"Trust not the monster Highfather.
He is mad with power."

44:03.934 --> 44:05.227
Silence.

44:06.562 --> 44:08.188
Unh!

44:08.939 --> 44:10.774
You can still redeem yourself.

44:12.693 --> 44:15.612
There is no redemption for me.

44:35.424 --> 44:39.011
<i>According to my sources,
the forensic evidence is unassailable.</i>

44:39.553 --> 44:41.972
<i>Fang marks in Victor Fries' neck.</i>

44:42.514 --> 44:47.436
<i>Slice impressions on Ray Palmer and the truck,
matching Wonder Woman's sword.</i>

44:47.603 --> 44:51.982
<i>Superman's fingerprints imbedded in steel
at the scene of the Stones' murders.</i>

44:52.274 --> 44:56.153
<i>Damning evidence for sure.
And what does the White House have to say?</i>

44:56.320 --> 45:00.407
<i>It would be inappropriate for the administration
to comment on an ongoing investigation.</i>

45:00.574 --> 45:04.495
<i>I'll remind everyone however, the police
have yet to find motives for these killings.</i>

45:04.661 --> 45:06.830
<i>Has the president been in contact
with the league?</i>

45:06.997 --> 45:11.210
<i>No. She expects them to fully cooperate
with the authorities, like any good citizen.</i>

45:11.377 --> 45:13.170
<i>No one is above the law.</i>

45:17.591 --> 45:19.510
Where are you?
The whole world's coming down.

45:19.676 --> 45:22.221
I'll be there as soon as I can.

45:31.647 --> 45:34.566
The only mystery
is why the rest of us are still alive.

45:34.733 --> 45:38.445
The league doesn't want to expose
themselves further. They've been sloppy.

45:38.737 --> 45:42.408
- We don't know they're behind this.
- They want us to know.

45:42.574 --> 45:46.203
Maybe that's their game.
Maybe they're warning us to stop the project.

45:46.370 --> 45:48.122
Fair Play's already done, Sivana.

45:48.288 --> 45:50.165
I was only there at the beginning.

45:50.332 --> 45:52.501
For chrissakes, Holt,
you named the damn thing.

45:52.668 --> 45:54.086
You got half of us hired.

45:54.294 --> 45:56.463
It wasn't me. It was Luthor.

45:56.630 --> 45:59.383
And where is he?
Does he even know what's happening?

45:59.716 --> 46:01.176
Is he even alive?

46:01.343 --> 46:05.055
Maybe we should go public.
If everyone knows, it'll take the heat off us.

46:05.222 --> 46:06.807
It'll be in the government's lap.

46:06.974 --> 46:08.934
Yeah, let's make them mad at us too.

46:09.101 --> 46:11.728
It's not as if they're protecting us.

46:47.014 --> 46:48.765
Come on!

46:50.058 --> 46:51.602
Aah!

47:32.976 --> 47:34.895
Aah! Aah!

47:39.608 --> 47:42.110
- Aah! Ah.
- Tina!

48:07.386 --> 48:08.470
Who are you?

48:15.727 --> 48:17.312
No, no, no.

48:23.860 --> 48:26.071
Everyone's dead.

48:26.738 --> 48:29.241
No. I hear a heartbeat.

48:35.122 --> 48:37.124
I should've called you when I got there.

48:37.291 --> 48:39.710
How am I gonna tell him about Tina?

48:39.876 --> 48:42.087
Who's to say he'll ever hear it?

48:42.254 --> 48:43.589
You still have no idea?

48:43.755 --> 48:45.257
Never saw anything like them.

48:45.424 --> 48:48.427
They were using boom tubes.
Had to come from your world.

48:48.594 --> 48:49.928
Not necessarily.

48:50.262 --> 48:54.057
Ever since she got here, the government's
been trying to replicate the boom tubes.

48:54.224 --> 48:55.434
Magnus told me.

48:55.767 --> 48:57.352
Maybe someone succeeded.

48:57.686 --> 48:58.729
So now what?

48:58.895 --> 49:03.066
We got a house full of dead scientists
and we're no closer to solving this thing.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.444
There is someone who could help.

49:05.986 --> 49:07.946
But you're not gonna like it.

49:49.029 --> 49:51.281
<i>Project Fair Play.</i>

49:51.448 --> 49:57.579
<i>I began it years ago in case the human race
needed to neutralize the Justice League.</i>

49:59.498 --> 50:04.002
<i>In other words, Superman,
in case we had to kill you.</i>

50:08.840 --> 50:11.385
I apologize for my bluntness.

50:11.551 --> 50:15.472
Let's face it, the Justice League
may be a three-headed hydra...

50:15.639 --> 50:18.475
...but there's only one head that truly counts.

50:18.642 --> 50:22.062
It's no surprise.
You've hated me from day one.

50:22.229 --> 50:24.272
I hated what you embody.

50:24.439 --> 50:27.609
Unassailable power is never to be trusted.

50:27.776 --> 50:29.903
Look at the way the government uses you...

50:30.070 --> 50:33.782
...and you, them,
while the world walks on eggshells.

50:33.949 --> 50:37.160
Eventually you would have had
to come to blows with Washington.

50:37.577 --> 50:39.913
The wonder is that it took this long.

50:40.080 --> 50:42.499
It's only happening
because someone means it to.

50:42.666 --> 50:44.793
If you're pulling the strings, Luthor....

50:44.960 --> 50:46.628
Again, you misread me.

50:46.795 --> 50:50.799
I never really cared for power.
I walked away from it.

50:50.966 --> 50:53.510
What I coveted was knowledge.

50:57.973 --> 51:02.602
I'm mapping the universe,
revealing all its glorious mysteries.

51:02.769 --> 51:06.022
And in a way, I have you to thank for it.

51:06.189 --> 51:07.441
What do you mean?

51:07.607 --> 51:10.110
I suppose you can know now.

51:10.277 --> 51:14.114
Most of this is based on
Kryptonian science...

51:14.489 --> 51:17.701
...which I downloaded from the ship
that brought you to Earth.

51:17.868 --> 51:19.369
Those files were damaged.

51:19.536 --> 51:22.414
No, we gave you fake copies.

51:22.581 --> 51:23.832
It was my idea.

51:23.999 --> 51:26.918
You were powerful enough
without having that knowledge.

51:27.085 --> 51:31.715
You bastard. You had no right.
Those files are mine. They're my legacy.

51:32.841 --> 51:36.970
Yes, they are.
Would you like to see your legacy?

51:42.476 --> 51:44.269
His name was Jor-El...

51:44.853 --> 51:47.898
...the leading scientist
on the planet Krypton.

51:48.064 --> 51:52.027
The woman is his wife, Lara, your mother.

51:57.532 --> 51:59.826
And here comes Dad.

52:00.452 --> 52:02.370
General Zod.

52:02.913 --> 52:06.583
A ruthless commander
who was taking over the planet.

52:06.750 --> 52:09.795
He drilled into Krypton's core
to power his military machine.

52:10.003 --> 52:11.546
A fatal mistake.

52:11.755 --> 52:14.049
But he would not die completely.

52:14.674 --> 52:18.303
It's not everyone who can witness
their own conception.

52:18.720 --> 52:22.182
A planet dies and you were born.

52:24.017 --> 52:25.977
Why did you keep this from me?

52:26.144 --> 52:28.688
I was afraid you'd emulate your father.

52:28.855 --> 52:31.316
Better you should think he was a hero.

52:31.483 --> 52:34.236
But you are no hero, not really.

52:34.402 --> 52:36.822
You're just a pit bull.

52:37.072 --> 52:39.741
I want those files.

52:40.325 --> 52:42.118
The originals are with Waller.

52:42.285 --> 52:45.580
Maybe you can negotiate a deal,
or take them by force.

52:45.747 --> 52:47.249
That tends to be your method.

52:47.415 --> 52:49.084
But I'd be careful.

52:49.251 --> 52:51.211
Project Fair Play worked.

52:51.378 --> 52:54.256
They can kill you now if they want.

53:02.430 --> 53:04.933
<i>You should have been straight with me,
Luthor.</i>

53:05.100 --> 53:06.977
<i>Things could have been different.</i>

53:07.143 --> 53:11.690
<i>In some ways,
I'm as much your creation as my father's.</i>

53:27.622 --> 53:30.166
NASA confirmed it, Madam President.

53:30.333 --> 53:34.004
<i>Luthor's ship was destroyed,
and his last visitor was Superman.</i>

53:34.170 --> 53:36.756
- Then they've killed them all.
<i>- What do we do?</i>

53:37.549 --> 53:39.259
We start Fair Play.

53:39.426 --> 53:41.511
Evacuate Metropolis.

53:46.683 --> 53:48.935
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

53:51.396 --> 53:52.772
Come on. Come on.

53:56.651 --> 54:00.196
We could give ourselves up. Get a lawyer.

54:00.363 --> 54:02.449
Or we can beat the hell out of them.

54:02.616 --> 54:04.326
Someone out there is playing us...

54:04.492 --> 54:07.454
...and we're not gonna find him
in police custody.

54:19.716 --> 54:21.718
Gonna be a hell of a webcast.

54:21.885 --> 54:22.928
If we live through it.

54:23.094 --> 54:25.055
Lois, it's Olsen.

54:26.890 --> 54:30.769
Yeah, I'm in the morgue,
with all the dead scientists.

54:31.144 --> 54:32.479
I'll send you some video.

54:34.481 --> 54:35.857
How'd you get in here?

54:36.024 --> 54:37.651
Get him out.

54:45.742 --> 54:48.370
What happened to this body?
It was here a minute ago.

54:48.536 --> 54:51.039
Don't look at me. I didn't take it.

55:05.553 --> 55:08.556
Do you realize it's been 10 years
since I met you?

55:09.432 --> 55:13.311
I was on the run, everyone after me,
and then you found me...

55:13.478 --> 55:16.272
...down at the docks, middle of the night...

55:16.439 --> 55:18.316
...a rat in my mouth.

55:18.483 --> 55:22.654
- Why you took me in, I'll never know.
- You were hungry.

55:22.821 --> 55:25.407
<i>Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman...</i>

55:25.699 --> 55:29.202
...by the authority granted me
by the president of the United States...

55:29.369 --> 55:32.247
...I call upon you to give yourselves up.

55:32.539 --> 55:36.001
Someone once asked
if I wanted to save the world or rule it.

55:36.710 --> 55:39.838
Today, it's going to be hard
to tell the difference.

55:40.005 --> 55:43.174
When I get out there, keep the shields up.
No one gets to Magnus.

55:43.842 --> 55:45.010
I'm going with him.

55:45.176 --> 55:47.345
If they can kill him, they can kill you.

55:47.512 --> 55:51.516
I've been here before.
This time, they're gonna have to kill me.

56:31.473 --> 56:34.142
Oh, my God. Tina.

56:59.292 --> 57:02.212
If you are under the impression
that we're surrendering...

57:02.378 --> 57:04.839
...let me relieve you of that notion.

57:05.006 --> 57:08.259
We have a witness to our innocence
recovering inside.

57:08.426 --> 57:10.011
We know you have Dr. Magnus.

57:10.178 --> 57:12.680
We can assure you,
he'll get the best of care.

57:12.847 --> 57:14.599
You'll see him when I say.

57:14.891 --> 57:17.018
Not this time, buddy.

57:53.847 --> 57:56.683
The lasers mimic a red-sun's radiation...

57:57.225 --> 57:59.102
...like Krypton's sun.

57:59.269 --> 58:00.520
You're looking better.

58:00.687 --> 58:02.313
Organic nanites.

58:02.480 --> 58:05.525
Platinum brought them,
with a change of clothes.

58:06.067 --> 58:07.360
Where is Tina?

58:09.696 --> 58:12.699
She's dead. I killed her...

58:12.866 --> 58:14.868
...about a year into our marriage.

58:15.034 --> 58:17.662
It was an accident, I assure you.

58:17.954 --> 58:19.998
You see, I always knew she loved you.

58:20.373 --> 58:24.460
Even back in college, she was only really happy
when the three of us were together.

58:24.627 --> 58:28.715
Even after I turned you into a monster,
even after that, she still wanted you.

58:29.132 --> 58:33.136
She married me, but that was an obligation.

58:33.553 --> 58:37.182
She kept urging me to find a cure for you.
Every day. Night and day.

58:37.348 --> 58:40.185
"Will, you've gotta do something.
Will, you can't abandon him.

58:40.351 --> 58:41.686
Will, Will, Will."

58:41.895 --> 58:43.188
She never let up.

58:43.354 --> 58:47.066
And finally one day, I'd had it and I hit her.

58:48.276 --> 58:50.737
And her head struck a table.

58:51.070 --> 58:52.906
She was gone.

58:53.281 --> 58:55.617
That's when I came up with her twin.

58:55.783 --> 59:00.330
She's made from a platinum isotope
that can mimic human flesh.

59:03.082 --> 59:04.459
What are you doing, Will?

59:04.626 --> 59:08.213
When I killed Tina, I had a revelation, Kirk.

59:08.922 --> 59:13.801
If I, the best and brightest of men,
were capable of such a monstrous act...

59:13.968 --> 59:16.137
...then what hope is there for humanity?

59:16.512 --> 59:19.557
Such horrors would never cease.

59:19.891 --> 59:24.437
But what if I could change it all?
"Change the world," like Luthor said.

59:24.896 --> 59:27.148
What if I could link all minds as one?

59:27.315 --> 59:30.652
No more personal anguish. No more hatred.

59:30.818 --> 59:32.278
No more guilt.

59:32.445 --> 59:35.198
And this is the instrument
of your benevolence?

59:35.615 --> 59:37.367
A nanite bomb.

59:38.076 --> 59:43.289
When it's set off, it will project over 7 billion
microscopic boom tubes around the world.

59:43.915 --> 59:46.584
<i>Each tube will plant a nanite
into someone's head.</i>

59:46.751 --> 59:50.380
<i>In that instant,
everyone will be connected as one...</i>

59:51.005 --> 59:52.632
...even the Justice League.

59:52.799 --> 59:55.718
So why haven't you done this already?

59:56.970 --> 59:59.722
I needed an energy source
strong enough to power it.

01:00:05.311 --> 01:00:06.688
I needed that.

01:00:13.111 --> 01:00:14.570
At ease, my friend.

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:17.949
When I'm done,
your personal suffering will end as well.

01:01:22.388 --> 01:01:24.182
I'll get us out.

01:01:25.975 --> 01:01:27.226
By the gods.

01:01:27.393 --> 01:01:29.562
We've neutralized your Mother Box,
Wonder Woman.

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:32.732
Step aside and I'll let you live.

01:01:37.904 --> 01:01:40.490
All right, sweetheart, have it your way.

01:01:54.712 --> 01:01:56.422
I thought he was dead.

01:01:56.589 --> 01:02:00.301
I teleported from my ship
before the Metal Man destroyed it.

01:02:00.676 --> 01:02:03.805
Unfortunately,
I can't teleport through those walls.

01:02:03.971 --> 01:02:05.390
Luthor, move.

01:02:05.807 --> 01:02:08.434
Trevor, you ass, listen to me.

01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:11.396
I've been monitoring the tower. It's Magnus.

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:14.565
He's the one. If we don't stop him,
he's going to take our minds.

01:02:14.732 --> 01:02:17.235
And I, for one, would like to keep mine.

01:02:30.581 --> 01:02:33.793
- We're wired.
- Activate the ship's core.

01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:47.932
Not even the boom tubes get through.
What now?

01:02:48.307 --> 01:02:51.519
I watched one madman
destroy my home world.

01:02:51.686 --> 01:02:54.147
I'm not going to let another harm this one.

01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:53.289
Get out of my house.

01:05:19.792 --> 01:05:21.711
It's over, Will.

01:05:22.253 --> 01:05:24.213
Not yet.

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:27.091
I've made a fairly strong recovery.

01:05:27.258 --> 01:05:29.010
Aah!

01:06:00.833 --> 01:06:02.960
I just burned all your Mother Boxes.

01:06:03.127 --> 01:06:05.838
No more disappearing acts for you. Aah!

01:07:26.544 --> 01:07:28.879
If only she hadn't wanted you...

01:07:29.046 --> 01:07:32.800
...you who only loved your bats
and test tubes.

01:07:33.008 --> 01:07:34.135
Wrong.

01:07:34.468 --> 01:07:37.012
I loved two people in my life...

01:07:37.805 --> 01:07:40.725
...and now they're both gone.

01:07:51.777 --> 01:07:53.070
Aah!

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.756
Fry, bitch.

01:08:31.901 --> 01:08:33.234
Go ahead.

01:08:36.697 --> 01:08:39.033
Bet you taste like crap.

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.165
You'll never make it.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.133
Low-tech. Works for me.

01:08:58.969 --> 01:09:01.095
The ship's core is destabilizing.

01:09:23.327 --> 01:09:27.331
It's funny how things can change
so quickly.

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:31.042
After a while,
you don't even recognize yourself anymore.

01:09:37.466 --> 01:09:38.884
Forgive me, Kirk.

01:09:54.984 --> 01:09:57.987
<i>Though it's been a week
since the showdown with Magnus' robots...</i>

01:09:58.153 --> 01:09:59.613
<i>...the cleanup still goes on.</i>

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:03.200
<i>As the city readjusts, so does this reporter.</i>

01:10:03.367 --> 01:10:06.954
<i>For a long time,
I've thought of the Justice League as inhuman.</i>

01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:10.666
<i>But when they saved us,
at a terrible risk to themselves...</i>

01:10:10.833 --> 01:10:14.044
<i>...I just thank heaven they were here
to protect us.</i>

01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:17.256
Next she'll be sending you selfies.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.844
I've been thinking, Kirk.
We need to shake things up a bit.

01:10:22.011 --> 01:10:25.681
Change the way we do things.
No more politics. No more killing.

01:10:27.016 --> 01:10:28.684
Seriously?

01:10:29.059 --> 01:10:30.394
Something to think about.

01:10:34.064 --> 01:10:36.358
It's time already?

01:10:39.778 --> 01:10:41.113
What's going on?

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.033
- Our beautiful Bekka is leaving us.
- Why?

01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:47.328
The problems of my past
linger in ways yours do not.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.580
It's time I went back and faced them.

01:10:49.747 --> 01:10:52.791
- By yourself?
- She has a coconspirator.

01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:57.463
Are you ready, my dear?

01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:59.673
They decided a few days ago.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.676
I've grown bored with this universe, Batman.

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:04.929
Time to explore others.

01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:07.681
I hope you understand.

01:11:07.848 --> 01:11:10.517
I do, though it doesn't mean I like it.

01:11:10.935 --> 01:11:12.853
You come to me if you need help.

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:18.525
I have something for you too, Superman.

01:11:23.489 --> 01:11:25.783
The original files from your ship.

01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:28.118
Aren't they supposed to be
with the government?

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:31.872
You know how things get lost
in bureaucracies.

01:11:32.039 --> 01:11:36.126
You'll find that Kryptonian science
has dramatic applications for Earth...

01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:39.630
...in medicine, engineering, physics.

01:11:39.797 --> 01:11:42.132
Be a real hero.

01:11:44.343 --> 01:11:46.136
Thanks, Lex.

01:11:46.428 --> 01:11:47.638
Shall we?

01:11:47.846 --> 01:11:51.183
Please, allow me.

01:12:07.199 --> 01:12:09.243
Looks like it's gonna be just the two of us.

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:11.537
Should I order out?

01:12:11.704 --> 01:12:13.789
Why don't we get started?

01:12:15.916 --> 01:12:17.960
I could use a science project.

01:12:18.627 --> 01:12:20.462
Time to look ahead, Kirk.

01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:22.339
You know what they say:

01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:25.551
"The past is like another planet."
