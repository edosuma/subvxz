- YEAH.
YUMMY, HUH?

18:02.247 --> 18:03.499
PEPPERONI'S MY FAVORITE.
MMM.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.251
MMM, MMM.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.378
- MMM.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.215
- SUSAN, COULD YOU ANSWER
A QUESTION FOR ME?

18:11.298 --> 18:13.300
- OOH, QUESTION
FROM A GENIUS?

18:13.383 --> 18:14.343
OKAY, SHOOT.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.677
- DO BEST FRIENDS
ALWAYS HONOR

18:15.761 --> 18:17.346
THEIR TIME COMMITMENTS
TO EACH OTHER?

18:17.429 --> 18:19.014
- OH, WELL, THEY CERTAINLY
TRY THEIR BEST.

18:19.097 --> 18:21.975
- OH, MY TURN
FOR A QUESTION.

18:22.059 --> 18:25.312
UNICORNS--ARE THEY REAL,
AND CAN I HAVE ONE?

18:25.395 --> 18:27.022
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT,
SQWEEP?

18:27.105 --> 18:29.608
- LINK HAS SUDDENLY ABANDONED
OUR FRIENDSHIP PLANS.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.443
- WHAT?
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.070
- IT HAS LEFT ME
EXPERIENCING A RUSH

18:33.153 --> 18:36.115
OF UNPLEASANT
EMOTIONAL REACTIONS.

18:37.616 --> 18:38.534
- WHERE'S LINK?

18:38.617 --> 18:40.202
I'VE GOT A FEW QUESTIONS
FOR HIM,

18:40.285 --> 18:41.870
LIKE HOW COULD HE DO THIS
TO YOU?

18:41.954 --> 18:44.081
- YEAH, AND UNICORNS.

18:44.164 --> 18:47.042
DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.877
- LINK IS ON A DATE
WITH STA'ABI.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.546
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
SHE ALWAYS TURNS HIM DOWN.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.631
VIOLENTLY.

18:52.714 --> 18:53.882
- FASTER THAN A FEMALE
ANTAREAN MANTIS.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.343
[gasps]
THE PHEROMONIUM.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.805
IF LINK USED IT,
HE'S IN TERRIBLE DANGER.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.890
both: HELLO, LINK.
- WHAT'S UP?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.059
- YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.
- I'LL SAY.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.561
- MM.
- [laughs]

19:05.644 --> 19:07.729
SORRY, LADIES,
THE LINKSTER

19:07.813 --> 19:09.273
IS OFFICIALLY
OFF THE MARKET.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.357
- FEEDING TIME IS OVER.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.777
- [grunts]
- NOW IT IS FEEDING TIME!

19:13.861 --> 19:15.070
- OKAY, WAIT,
IS THAT A FLIRTY EUPHEMISM,

19:15.153 --> 19:16.363
OR ARE YOU ACTUALLY
TALKING ABOUT--

19:16.446 --> 19:19.741
- LINK, STA'ABI'S GOING
TO EAT YOU!

19:19.825 --> 19:21.159
- THE PHEROMONIUM
WAS SYNTHESIZED

19:21.243 --> 19:22.452
FOR ANTAREAN MANTISES,

19:22.536 --> 19:25.163
AND ANTAREAN MANTISES
EAT THEIR MATES.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.248
- TALKING ABOUT THE WHAT?

19:26.331 --> 19:28.083
all: MMM.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.501
- [screams]

19:29.585 --> 19:31.795
SO I'M GUESSING
THE NARGLE-BEAST IS--

19:31.879 --> 19:34.423
- MY FAVORITE MEAL.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.883
AAH!
[grunts]

19:38.760 --> 19:39.928
- [sighs]
THANKS.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.179
AND BEFORE YOU SAY IT,

19:41.263 --> 19:42.222
I AM PROBABLY
NEVER GONNA SPRAY MYSELF

19:42.306 --> 19:44.892
WITH SOMETHING
EXPERIMENTAL AGAIN.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.185
SO LESSON LEARNED,
PROBABLY.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.563
- SEE WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU USE OTHER PEOPLE, LINK?

19:49.646 --> 19:52.024
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.
YOU ARE SO--

19:52.107 --> 19:53.609
[sniffs]

19:53.692 --> 19:55.027
YUMMY.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.320
- NOT YOU TOO.
- I-I CAN'T HELP IT.

19:56.403 --> 19:59.615
I-I JUST THINK
YOU'D BE REALLY TASTY

19:59.698 --> 20:00.949
WITH A SIDE OF FRIES.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.452
all: MMM.
- FISH AND CHIPS.

20:03.535 --> 20:07.706
- COME HERE,
MY TASTY LITTLE NARGLE-BEAST.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.250
- AAH, OH, MAN.
- AFTER HIM!

20:10.334 --> 20:12.461
- CHASED BY LINK-HUNGRY WOMEN--

20:12.544 --> 20:14.254
IN MY DREAM,
IT WAS MUCH COOLER.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.256
- I WANNA EAT HIM SO BAD.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.174
AND I DON'T EVEN
LIKE SEAFOOD.

20:17.257 --> 20:20.177
- OUT OF MY WAY!
I'M EATING LINK.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.846
- EATING LINK?
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND!

20:22.930 --> 20:25.390
I MEAN, IF ANYONE SHOULD
GET TO EAT HIM, IT'S ME.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.151
[engine starts]

20:36.234 --> 20:38.570
[tires screeching]

20:40.405 --> 20:44.576
[horn honking]

20:46.370 --> 20:48.163
- AAH. AAH!
[door opens]

20:52.042 --> 20:52.876
YOU KNOW,
I THINK WE SHOULD

20:52.960 --> 20:54.628
START SEEING OTHER PEOPLE.

20:54.711 --> 20:57.673
- THERE IS NO ESCAPE.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.552
- SQWEEP!

21:02.636 --> 21:03.720
[grunting]

21:03.804 --> 21:05.681
- [grunts]

21:05.764 --> 21:09.184
- HIGHER, SQWEEP, HIGHER!

21:11.103 --> 21:11.770
- AAH!

21:11.853 --> 21:13.438
- [grunts]

21:15.774 --> 21:17.275
- OW!

21:19.611 --> 21:20.988
COME BACK!

21:22.197 --> 21:23.699
- YOU SAVED ME, THANKS.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.617
- ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH,
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.996
- YOU'RE A LOT BETTER FRIEND
THAN I'VE BEEN, SQWEEP.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.373
- THIS IS TRUE,
BUT I FORGIVE YOU.

21:31.456 --> 21:31.915
CHECKERS?

21:31.999 --> 21:33.875
- YOU KNOW IT.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.503
SO HOW LONG
TILL THIS PHEROMONIUM WEARS OFF?

21:36.586 --> 21:37.713
- THREE TO FOUR WEEKS.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.006
- WAIT A SECOND--
THREE TO FOUR WEEKS?

21:39.089 --> 21:41.383
YOU MEAN I'M STUCK UP HERE?

21:41.466 --> 21:44.052
WELL, WE GOT THE CHECKERS,
RIGHT?

21:44.136 --> 21:45.846
YOUR MOVE, PAL.
