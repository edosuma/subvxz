Jonah.

01:52.579 --> 01:53.751
Come pose for the camera.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.054
- All set.
- Come on.

01:56.149 --> 01:58.686
Mama!
- Hurry up, hurry up! Get ready!

01:58.785 --> 02:00.264
Say cheese!

02:01.855 --> 02:04.563
<i>There was a time when we were happy.</i>

02:04.657 --> 02:08.104
<i>We were together.
My mom, my dad and me.</i>

02:08.193 --> 02:09.502
- Hey there!
- Hello!

02:25.411 --> 02:26.890
Sweet dreams.

02:32.552 --> 02:33.860
Are you all right?

02:36.756 --> 02:37.826
Here you go.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.164
Thank you.

02:40.460 --> 02:43.134
Let's see. There we go. Good.

03:02.248 --> 03:03.989
No! No!

03:14.827 --> 03:16.101
Daddy?

03:39.886 --> 03:42.264
<i>The Feather King took my mom.</i>

03:43.489 --> 03:45.400
<i>And I want her back.</i>

04:21.861 --> 04:25.070
- Dad!
- No, no. Your dad isn't here.

04:25.164 --> 04:29.203
This is the blanket talking,
and the blanket must keep sleeping.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.610
That's a blanket's job!

04:30.703 --> 04:32.080
But it's time to get up!

04:32.171 --> 04:34.742
I'll tell your dad you came by. Okay?

04:35.942 --> 04:37.285
Mighty-night.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.599
Hey, that tickles!

04:56.829 --> 04:59.503
Hey! What are you doing in here?
Get out!

05:01.034 --> 05:02.945
Jonah! Here I come!

05:03.703 --> 05:05.842
I'm gonna get you, you little carrot!

05:07.307 --> 05:08.513
I'm over here!

05:08.608 --> 05:09.916
All right, Jonah!

05:11.044 --> 05:14.025
Here I come! I know exactly where...

05:26.793 --> 05:29.967
- Got you! I knew you were in here.
- No, no, that tickles.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.010
I Want to steer the ship one day.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.308
Where do you Want to go?

05:37.403 --> 05:40.316
To the Feather King Kingdom.
To find Mom.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.946
But, Jonah, that's not possible.

06:03.629 --> 06:04.767
No, no, no, no!

06:21.013 --> 06:23.152
Jonah! Thank goodness
you're all right.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.092
I couldn't find you anywhere.

06:25.184 --> 06:27.061
Don't ever jump into the water
like that.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.394
- All for an old bottle?
- Wait. No!

06:31.391 --> 06:32.893
I was gonna to use that bottle.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.902
You know she's not getting
your letters, son...

06:34.994 --> 06:37.133
Yes, she is! I know she is!

06:37.797 --> 06:38.832
Jonah...

07:07.193 --> 07:10.265
'Dear <i>Mom, I'm writing to you
even though Dad doesn't believe</i>

07:10.363 --> 07:11.865
<i>“you 're getting my letters.</i>

07:11.964 --> 07:13.602
<i>“But I know you are.</i>

07:13.699 --> 07:16.407
<i>"Every night he watches out
for something.</i>

07:16.502 --> 07:19.813
<i>"I think he's afraid.
But I don't know what has afraid of. "</i>

07:33.352 --> 07:34.558
No!

07:38.424 --> 07:41.030
Bill. Bill, I saw something!

07:41.127 --> 07:42.401
<i>What did you see'?</i>

07:43.262 --> 07:44.900
I don't know, but it looked like...

07:44.997 --> 07:46.840
<i>"It looked like"?</i>

07:46.933 --> 07:48.776
<i>How many times do I have to tell you?</i>

07:48.868 --> 07:50.040
<i>If the Feather King comes,</i>

07:50.136 --> 07:52.742
<i>you won't "think" it's him.
You'll know it's him!</i>

07:52.839 --> 07:54.216
Yes, of course, but I...

07:54.307 --> 07:55.945
<i>Only call if you see him!</i>

07:56.075 --> 07:59.079
<i>And keep it quiet!
The radio is no toy.</i>

07:59.178 --> 08:00.953
- But What if...
- / <i>said,</i> no!

08:01.047 --> 08:03.357
<i>The sea is the safest place to be,</i>

08:03.449 --> 08:05.395
<i>or I wouldn't be here myself!</i>

08:05.485 --> 08:07.522
<i>The Feather King hates water.</i>

08:07.620 --> 08:10.897
<i>He'll never find us! End of story!
Over and out.</i>

08:10.990 --> 08:12.367
He mustn't take my boy.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.905
Hello? Are you there?

08:16.028 --> 08:18.372
<i>“Dad knows the Feather King took you.</i>

08:19.332 --> 08:21.312
<i>“But he doesn't want to talk about it.</i>

08:22.134 --> 08:24.580
“ <i>If I could, I would come
and get you myself</i>

08:24.670 --> 08:26.980
<i>“so we could all be together again.</i>

08:27.740 --> 08:29.276
<i>“We miss you</i> a <i>lot.</i> “

08:47.627 --> 08:48.627
Dad?

08:48.694 --> 08:50.002
What are you making?

08:50.096 --> 08:53.270
It's a little surprise just for you!

08:53.366 --> 08:56.142
It's a fresh carrot! You picked it.

08:56.235 --> 08:59.512
Yes, well, it doesn't grow very well
out here, so...

09:03.442 --> 09:06.218
It tastes sweet and salty!

09:07.146 --> 09:08.318
Good!

09:08.414 --> 09:10.917
Back home, on land,
they grow much bigger...

09:11.050 --> 09:13.360
Who cares about that?
They're our carrots.

09:13.452 --> 09:15.056
We grew them ourselves.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.730
One nut. Here.

09:22.795 --> 09:23.795
Thank you.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.564
There.

09:29.468 --> 09:30.674
Good.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.579
This ship will last us 1,000 years.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.483
Help! Jonah!

09:40.713 --> 09:43.819
Good. Tighten it. Hurry!

09:45.384 --> 09:49.457
One, two, one, two, one...

10:00.299 --> 10:03.405
Dad, What will we do
if we run out of nuts?

10:03.502 --> 10:04.572
"What will we do"?

10:16.282 --> 10:19.456
I'll be fine on my own.
Nothing ever happens here.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.088
No diving into the water.

10:21.487 --> 10:22.989
- Don't worry.
- All right.

10:23.089 --> 10:25.035
And no talking to strangers.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.432
Who would I talk to?

10:26.525 --> 10:27.703
And if something should happen...

10:27.727 --> 10:31.231
I know. The flare is on the bridge
and you've taken the lifeboat

10:31.330 --> 10:33.105
so I'll call for help on the radio.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.770
Exactly. But the radio is not a toy.

10:35.868 --> 10:39.441
Yes, I know.
The radio is only for emergencies.

10:39.538 --> 10:42.417
That's right. Good.
I'll hurry back soon.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.283
Okay. Bye.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.156
Bye.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.939
The radio is not a toy.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.950
<i>Mayday! Mayday! This is Bill!</i>

11:19.045 --> 11:22.288
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i> SOS! SOS!

11:22.381 --> 11:24.418
<i>This is Bill calling! Hello'?</i>

11:24.517 --> 11:26.588
<i>Help me! Somebody please help me!</i>

11:26.752 --> 11:28.561
<i>Mayday! Mayday! May...</i>

11:28.654 --> 11:30.725
Hello? Who's there?

11:30.823 --> 11:33.360
<i>Who do you think?
You have to get here now.</i>

11:33.459 --> 11:34.665
<i>He's found me!</i>

11:34.760 --> 11:38.207
Dad's not here. We can come
and get you when he gets back.

11:38.698 --> 11:43.306
<i>He's gone? Then we're doomed!
The Feather King is coming.</i>

11:43.402 --> 11:45.780
Mom! The Feather King...

11:45.871 --> 11:46.975
I'm on my Way.

11:47.306 --> 11:50.253
'Dear <i>Dad, I have gone to find
the Feather King</i>

11:50.342 --> 11:52.253
<i>“so I can bring Mom back home.“</i>

12:08.894 --> 12:10.703
You've steered <i>it</i> before, right?

12:12.431 --> 12:14.240
Only when it was sitting still.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.744
<i>Do you think the Feather King
will just wait around for you</i>

12:17.837 --> 12:19.214
<i>to learn how to steer it'?</i>

12:19.305 --> 12:20.682
I hope so.

13:14.426 --> 13:15.996
<i>Do you see it'?</i>

13:16.095 --> 13:17.438
<i>The island.</i>

13:19.532 --> 13:21.102
<i>There's a house on it.</i>

13:22.434 --> 13:23.640
<i>Ifs made of wood.</i>

13:25.104 --> 13:26.583
<i>Tell me when you see it.</i>

13:29.475 --> 13:31.113
Yes. There it is.

13:35.381 --> 13:36.883
Yes! I see it.

13:36.982 --> 13:40.122
<i>I probably should've mentioned
something else.</i>

13:40.219 --> 13:41.219
Like What?

13:41.287 --> 13:43.597
<i>There are</i> a <i>few sharp rocks
all around it.</i>

14:09.815 --> 14:11.658
<i>Try to get as close as you can.</i>

14:12.351 --> 14:14.797
- Are you hurt?
- What? No, no, no.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.298
<i>But they are here!</i>

14:16.388 --> 14:19.164
<i>- Who is?
- The Feather Princes.</i>

14:34.807 --> 14:37.981
No, no! Get out of there!

14:38.677 --> 14:40.679
- Go away!
- Bill! I'm here!

14:41.046 --> 14:42.320
Jonah!

14:46.619 --> 14:47.893
Be careful!

14:49.722 --> 14:51.030
Watch out!

15:17.316 --> 15:18.818
Take that, ya varmints.

15:19.952 --> 15:20.952
Here! Catch!

15:21.954 --> 15:23.092
Heads up, boy!

15:26.458 --> 15:28.529
Stay right there. I'm coming over.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.036
No, no!

15:33.532 --> 15:36.411
Hey! Get off me. Get it off of me.
Go on!

15:41.674 --> 15:44.052
- Here comes more!
- What? No!

15:46.378 --> 15:48.119
We have to go! Now!

15:56.622 --> 15:58.568
You'll never catch me, ya varmints!

16:16.342 --> 16:21.849
Let's see. Nothing here.
Nothing there. Nothing there either.

16:23.082 --> 16:26.620
Yes! We did it. We got away.
Sit here. Come.

16:32.825 --> 16:33.929
Now what'?

16:35.327 --> 16:36.738
He can hear you.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.340
What are we doing?

16:40.432 --> 16:41.706
We are hiding.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.178
From who?

16:44.269 --> 16:46.442
- The Feather King.
- What?

16:46.772 --> 16:48.513
But then he'll never find us.

16:48.607 --> 16:49.779
Exactly.

16:50.442 --> 16:51.614
Well, that's dumb.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.177
Hey, wait. Stop!

16:53.278 --> 16:56.020
- Hey, Feather King! We're here!
- No!

16:56.982 --> 16:59.519
- What do you think you're doing?
- Hey! I wanna see him.

16:59.618 --> 17:00.790
No, absolutely not.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.866
I do, too. He took my mom!

17:02.955 --> 17:06.266
Are you kidding? The Kingdom
of the Feather King is horrible.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.358
It's full of rules.

17:07.459 --> 17:09.837
Wait. Have you been there?

17:09.928 --> 17:11.339
I built it.

17:11.430 --> 17:15.742
And then I escaped. So hide
and be quiet, or he'll find us.

17:24.076 --> 17:25.987
Hey! Wait.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.853
Come here, you little troublemaker.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.894
Hey, Feather King! Where are you?

17:30.983 --> 17:32.587
No! Do not do that.

17:39.024 --> 17:40.025
There he is.

17:40.459 --> 17:41.767
No!

17:48.934 --> 17:51.505
No. He can't get through the storm.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.178
Stop! You have to stop the ship. Bill!

17:56.275 --> 18:00.155
No! We're almost free from him now.
Go on!

18:00.245 --> 18:01.588
It's all right!

18:22.935 --> 18:24.073
No.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.489
The Feather King.

18:36.415 --> 18:37.415
Hey!

18:37.483 --> 18:39.224
So, we meet again, Bill.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.553
Why can't you just leave me alone?

18:41.653 --> 18:43.655
Mora made a ticket for you, Bill.

18:43.755 --> 18:47.134
Well, she couldn't have!
I'm not like the rest. I'm special.

18:47.926 --> 18:49.371
It's against the rules.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.441
That's up to Mora and you know it.

18:51.530 --> 18:53.908
You'll be picked up
like everyone else.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.877
- Goodbye.
- No! He's leaving.

18:59.605 --> 19:00.640
Wait!

19:09.148 --> 19:10.593
Where is he?

19:10.682 --> 19:11.922
He's gone now.

19:12.618 --> 19:14.256
But I need to talk to him.

19:14.753 --> 19:17.461
I don't Want to go. I'm not ready.

19:18.123 --> 19:19.123
What's that?

19:19.191 --> 19:21.797
It's a ticket for the Kingdom
of the Feather King.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.601
Where Mom is.

19:24.263 --> 19:25.765
Is there one for me?

19:26.565 --> 19:29.444
Hey! You can have mine.

19:29.535 --> 19:30.639
Really?

19:30.769 --> 19:33.010
- You Want to see your mom, don't you?
- Yeah!

19:33.105 --> 19:36.279
Good. Then give the ticket
to the captain. She'll take you there.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.548
The captain? Who's that?

19:38.644 --> 19:39.748
See ya.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.524
Wait. How do I find the captain?

19:45.617 --> 19:48.427
Just stay put
and you'll get there eventually.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.591
But the ship is sinking!

19:51.223 --> 19:52.224
Exactly!

19:56.261 --> 19:57.296
Bill!

19:57.396 --> 19:58.704
Bon voyage!

20:16.014 --> 20:18.722
Mayday! Mayday! I'm sinking!

22:24.843 --> 22:27.551
Excuse me? ls this the Kingdom
of the Feather King?

22:27.646 --> 22:28.852
Yeah.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.857
Is the captain around?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.301
Ticket, please! Ticket, please!

22:38.390 --> 22:39.467
Imagine it ending like this.

22:39.491 --> 22:40.799
Ticket, please.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.696
Ticket? Next!

22:43.829 --> 22:45.001
I can't believe this is it...

22:45.097 --> 22:47.202
- Ticket!
- Ticket?

22:47.299 --> 22:48.710
I have to see your ticket.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.302
Do you sail to the Feather King?

22:50.402 --> 22:52.113
- That's exactly What I do.
- Why is this happening?

22:52.137 --> 22:54.981
No time for questions. Give me
your ticket or get back in line.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.311
I came to get my mom.

22:59.611 --> 23:00.817
Just a minute.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.520
Hey! Not so fast.

23:04.616 --> 23:07.688
- This isn't your ticket.
- Yes, it is. I got it myself.

23:07.786 --> 23:11.393
No, it isn't. And you're not allowed
onboard Without your own ticket.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.163
- Says who?
- Says Mora.

23:13.258 --> 23:14.828
- What for?
Because.

23:14.926 --> 23:17.668
Because, why?
- It's not my job to answer questions

23:17.763 --> 23:20.767
from nosy bunny boys.
If you have a ticket you can come.

23:20.866 --> 23:24.279
If not, then you'll just have to
stay here until your time is up.

23:24.369 --> 23:27.179
- When is that?
- Only Mora can tell you.

23:27.272 --> 23:28.842
You don't know very much, do you?

23:28.940 --> 23:31.045
Don't get fresh with me, young man.

23:31.143 --> 23:33.851
All right. Okay. Bye bye then.

23:33.945 --> 23:34.980
Good day.

23:36.448 --> 23:37.859
- Ticket?
- Here.

23:39.217 --> 23:41.219
All right.
Let me see your ticket.

23:42.821 --> 23:44.994
- Your ticket, please.
- Yes, yes.

23:46.024 --> 23:48.834
- Ticket?
- I really don't wanna go.

23:49.828 --> 23:51.501
- Your ticket?
- Here.

25:57.622 --> 26:01.035
I've never seen so <i>many</i> houses before.

26:01.126 --> 26:03.197
<i>I wonder where we're going.</i>

26:11.469 --> 26:13.847
<i>I sure hope my mom is there.</i>

26:20.312 --> 26:21.382
They're so high.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.877
Stop! Stop that little bunny!

26:45.270 --> 26:46.544
Who's that?

26:49.474 --> 26:51.579
Haven't we seen him before?

26:52.978 --> 26:55.049
How odd that looks!

27:16.534 --> 27:18.411
Where is she?

27:18.503 --> 27:20.210
Where is my mom?

27:20.305 --> 27:21.648
How would I know that?

27:21.740 --> 27:23.151
You took her. I saw you.

27:23.241 --> 27:24.914
Wait. What's going on here?

27:25.010 --> 27:26.421
You're not Bill. Where is he?

27:26.511 --> 27:28.115
He gave me his ticket.

27:28.213 --> 27:30.352
He What? Wait.

27:30.448 --> 27:33.156
No, no, that's not how it works.
Unacceptable.

27:36.021 --> 27:38.126
Hey, all of this is your fault.

27:38.223 --> 27:39.258
How is it my fault?

27:39.357 --> 27:42.133
It's your job to make sure
nothing like this ever happens.

27:42.227 --> 27:44.036
I mean, I can't be everywhere.

27:47.866 --> 27:49.607
Hey, wait. Stop!

27:50.568 --> 27:51.848
Where do you think you're going?

27:51.903 --> 27:53.473
I'm looking for my mom.

27:53.571 --> 27:54.572
No.

28:07.619 --> 28:10.759
Mom! Where are you? I'm here.

28:12.223 --> 28:15.363
- Let me go.
- We cannot do that.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.963
- Mora says that...
- Who's Mora anyway?

28:18.063 --> 28:20.202
Mora's the one who's in charge here.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.418
Then why is it called
the Kingdom of the Feather King?

28:22.500 --> 28:24.946
- I didn't choose the name, all right?
- Did Mora?

28:25.036 --> 28:27.573
Enough. You cannot be here
Without a ticket.

28:28.139 --> 28:29.413
But I'm here anyway.

28:29.507 --> 28:32.249
Yes, that is the problem
and will have to take care of that,

28:32.343 --> 28:34.584
or we'll all turn into nothing.

28:34.679 --> 28:36.181
What do you mean, "nothing"?

28:36.281 --> 28:38.784
I mean, nothing.
When you completely disappear.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.590
Completely?
- Yes, completely.

28:40.685 --> 28:43.529
Gone. Left. Banished. Forever.

28:43.621 --> 28:46.898
When you no longer exist. Anywhere.

28:46.991 --> 28:49.665
That sounds Weird.
I don't know What you're talking about

28:49.761 --> 28:51.365
but you took my mom.

28:51.463 --> 28:54.706
If Mora is in charge, then go get her
so I can talk to her.

28:54.799 --> 28:55.799
Right now!

28:55.867 --> 28:58.074
What? No, that is not allowed.

28:58.169 --> 28:59.580
Says who?

29:02.941 --> 29:04.682
I'll talk to Mora.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.764
Why is the whole town falling apart'?

29:18.857 --> 29:22.498
Bill was supposed to look after it,
but he ran away.

29:23.228 --> 29:26.402
But no one can escape
the Feather King forever!

29:34.272 --> 29:37.082
What if Mora understands and says
I can look for my mom?

29:37.175 --> 29:38.620
Then will it be okay?

29:38.710 --> 29:40.189
She Won't understand.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.655
But What if she does?

29:41.746 --> 29:45.421
Yes, well, if she did say yes,
it'd be highly unlikely,

29:45.517 --> 29:47.827
but then I suppose
you'd be allowed to stay.

29:47.919 --> 29:48.919
Yes!

29:48.987 --> 29:51.467
Don't get your hopes up.
It's impossible.

29:51.556 --> 29:53.297
It sounds a little bit possible.

29:53.391 --> 29:58.067
You have no idea how serious this is,
when you have no business being here.

30:16.181 --> 30:18.024
Is this Where Mora lives?

30:18.750 --> 30:21.629
I have nothing to do
with who comes here.

30:21.719 --> 30:24.029
Mora's the one
who hands me the tickets.

30:24.122 --> 30:26.500
- The ticket tokens?
- Yes.

30:27.192 --> 30:30.196
- Then they tell you who to pick up?
- Yes.

30:30.295 --> 30:33.276
How does she decide
which tickets to give you?

30:33.398 --> 30:37.107
- I don't ask any questions.
Dust ask about my mom.

30:39.671 --> 30:43.380
Mora, may the boy stay
and look for his mother?

30:50.882 --> 30:51.883
No!

31:07.398 --> 31:08.775
What are you doing?

31:08.867 --> 31:11.211
Everything will collapse
if you aren't careful.

31:11.302 --> 31:13.612
- But nothing happened.
- That does it!

31:13.705 --> 31:15.048
Mora has answered.

31:15.139 --> 31:17.278
You must leave immediately.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.982
I don't Want to. No! Let me go!

31:29.621 --> 31:31.862
We must get him out of here.

31:37.095 --> 31:38.335
Let me out of here.

31:53.144 --> 31:55.590
Well? What am I supposed
to do with that?

31:55.680 --> 31:57.125
Let me out.

32:02.887 --> 32:05.527
- Hey.
- You again.

32:05.623 --> 32:07.398
What did Mora say to you?

32:08.159 --> 32:10.139
She didn't say anything.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.705
To the Fogbanks.

32:17.802 --> 32:19.372
I don't wanna go there.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.713
I have to find my mom!

32:46.130 --> 32:49.168
- What's going on?
- That's a good question.

32:49.267 --> 32:51.269
Leave me alone. Let me go.

32:51.369 --> 32:54.509
- Stop it! Just stop wiggling will you?
- What are you doing? Let go!

32:54.605 --> 32:57.347
- You're impossible to fly with.
- I'm just gonna escape again.

32:57.442 --> 32:59.217
And I'll find you again.

33:00.445 --> 33:02.516
Did you find your mom?

33:02.613 --> 33:04.650
Why don't you do something good
for once

33:04.749 --> 33:06.786
instead of just doing as you're told
all the time?

33:06.884 --> 33:08.158
This is all your fault.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.030
Will you send him back now?

33:11.122 --> 33:12.760
You know I can't do that.

33:12.857 --> 33:15.360
He has to stay
until his ticket breaks loose.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.098
- Here?
- Here?

33:17.195 --> 33:19.835
- Here.
- I'm so sorry about all this.

33:19.931 --> 33:22.434
You can't go around the rules.
You know that!

33:22.533 --> 33:24.479
I know. It's just that...

33:24.569 --> 33:26.446
I'm sorry we took him
from his father.

33:26.537 --> 33:27.880
Bill did that. Not us.

33:27.972 --> 33:29.178
He should apologize.

33:29.273 --> 33:30.809
You Want me to apologize?

33:30.908 --> 33:33.013
That seems only fair
since you brought him here.

33:33.111 --> 33:34.249
Baah!

33:34.345 --> 33:36.621
You can't just "baah" your way...

33:42.820 --> 33:45.096
I can't stand seeing the kid sad
like that.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.600
These rules are stupid.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.295
I Won't obey any of them.

33:48.393 --> 33:49.428
You Won't obey them?

33:49.527 --> 33:52.770
If you can get out of here
then tell us how to get out.

33:52.864 --> 33:55.140
Yeah, good idea, Bill.

33:55.233 --> 33:56.576
Go ahead and tell us.

33:56.667 --> 33:59.147
I wanna find my mom
and bring her back to Dad.

33:59.237 --> 34:01.911
- And you should stay out of it.
- But Mora said that...

34:02.006 --> 34:04.452
I don't care. I don't believe in Mora.

34:06.978 --> 34:08.685
You don't believe in her?

34:08.780 --> 34:10.315
- No.
- That doesn't work.

34:10.415 --> 34:12.485
Why? What difference does it make?

34:12.583 --> 34:13.857
Well...

34:15.485 --> 34:18.467
Come on. We're leaving him.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.831
- Follow me.
- But what if I wanna stay here'?

34:20.925 --> 34:23.337
Then you can deal with Mora yourself.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.271
Don't worry. I'll think of something.

34:28.366 --> 34:30.368
You'd just take off again.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.036
Mom.

35:01.399 --> 35:02.935
Where are you?

35:11.642 --> 35:14.054
<i>Lord, you know me</i>

35:14.145 --> 35:16.250
<i>You know my heart</i>

35:16.814 --> 35:21.923
<i>You even know the deepest parts</i>

35:22.019 --> 35:24.556
<i>When I was born</i>

35:24.655 --> 35:27.192
<i>When I was good</i>

35:27.291 --> 35:32.001
<i>You even knew me before I was formed</i>

35:38.903 --> 35:42.851
<i>Oh, what a wonder you are</i>

35:51.048 --> 35:56.225
<i>I can trust the hands that made me</i>

35:56.320 --> 36:01.201
<i>I can trust the one who shaped me</i>

36:01.325 --> 36:06.741
<i>You'll never leave or forsake me</i>

36:06.831 --> 36:11.712
<i>Yes, it's true
I can trust in you</i>

36:42.767 --> 36:44.075
Mom?

36:46.671 --> 36:49.709
Is that really you? Jonah?

36:51.108 --> 36:52.451
Mommy!

36:55.713 --> 36:57.920
I can't believe you're here.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.859
I missed you so much.

37:06.123 --> 37:08.660
No. Did the Feather King...

37:08.793 --> 37:13.037
No, don't worry. No.
I'm here with somebody else's ticket.

37:13.130 --> 37:15.007
Mora still has mine.

37:15.099 --> 37:18.512
If we throw yours back
then we can go home to Dad.

37:18.603 --> 37:20.082
It's not that simple.

37:20.171 --> 37:22.777
Why not? Of course it is.

37:22.873 --> 37:26.878
No one thought that I'd find you,
but I did. All by myself.

37:27.011 --> 37:30.220
Yes. You found me, my brave son.

37:35.686 --> 37:37.791
Why aren't you in town
with everyone else'?

37:38.723 --> 37:41.033
Well, it's nicer here.
Don't you think?

37:42.393 --> 37:45.499
Yeah. Everyone is so sad there.

37:45.596 --> 37:48.270
I'm not. Thanks to you, dear.

37:48.366 --> 37:49.401
'Cause of me?

37:49.500 --> 37:53.539
That's right. I was sad too in
the beginning. I missed you so much.

37:54.238 --> 37:57.515
I just wandered around
trying to figure out What to do.

37:58.909 --> 38:03.449
But then one clay, much to my surprise,
I saw something floating in the water.

38:03.581 --> 38:06.687
- A message in a bottle!
Right, and when I read your letter

38:06.784 --> 38:09.355
all of our happy memories
came back to me.

38:09.453 --> 38:13.128
All the Wonderful things you and me
and your father have shared.

38:13.724 --> 38:15.567
That made me very happy.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.300
That's why I decided to stay here
and I hoped

38:18.429 --> 38:21.103
- you'd write me again.
- And I did.

38:21.198 --> 38:23.508
Dad's gonna be so happy
to see you again.

38:23.601 --> 38:24.773
He misses you a lot.

38:24.869 --> 38:27.577
Jonah, there's something
you need to understand.

38:29.707 --> 38:30.947
Do you live there?

38:31.042 --> 38:33.886
Yes. I have something to show you.
Come on.

38:38.282 --> 38:40.193
It's so big and beautiful.

38:41.786 --> 38:43.163
Cool.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.493
Amazing.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.874
- See?
- My letters.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.041
You got them.

39:04.942 --> 39:06.546
Here you go.

39:06.644 --> 39:08.749
So, how did you get here?

39:08.846 --> 39:11.850
Someone called Bill helped me.

39:11.949 --> 39:15.396
But the Feather King's mad
'cause I don't have a ticket.

39:16.821 --> 39:18.129
What is this?

39:18.723 --> 39:20.703
Haven't you had an apple before?

39:21.726 --> 39:23.467
I like carrots better too.

39:23.561 --> 39:24.938
But they don't grow here.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.906
On the boat we eat seaweed.

39:26.997 --> 39:29.568
But rabbits are supposed to live
on dry land.

39:29.667 --> 39:31.772
Dad's afraid of the Feather King.

39:31.869 --> 39:35.476
That's only because he doesn't
understand What the Feather King is.

39:35.906 --> 39:39.149
If you're not picked up by him
you will turn into nothing.

39:40.277 --> 39:43.781
So if you weren't here,
then you'd be nothing?

39:43.881 --> 39:47.556
- You mean you'd be all gone?
Jonah, I'm right here.

39:50.020 --> 39:52.523
- Does your father know you're here?
- No.

39:52.623 --> 39:54.261
He'd be afraid if he knew.

39:54.592 --> 39:56.663
Why don't we go find him together?

39:59.330 --> 40:01.901
So, did you write me another letter?

40:01.999 --> 40:04.343
You can't read it
While I'm here though.

40:04.435 --> 40:05.778
I'd be embarrassed.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.577
There's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

40:07.671 --> 40:09.275
You can tell me anything.

40:17.615 --> 40:19.617
Then I sneaked in
While Dad was sleeping

40:19.717 --> 40:21.594
- and put an octopus in his bed.
Really?

40:21.685 --> 40:23.631
- He was laughing so hard.
- A live octopus?

40:23.721 --> 40:25.496
He said that it tickled.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.901
- So he threw it into the ocean.
- He must've been surprised...

40:27.925 --> 40:29.700
I ran away as fast as I could.

40:29.794 --> 40:33.173
And he chased me all around the boat
and I locked the door

40:33.264 --> 40:36.177
but he sneaked up on me
and started tickling me.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.712
It was so funny.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.914
Just look at you.
You've grown so much.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.452
Dad says I'm gonna be really big.

40:51.916 --> 40:55.363
- I miss Daddy.
- Yeah, me too.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.558
Why can't we be together forever?

41:20.678 --> 41:23.056
You shouldn't be here, my son.

41:44.668 --> 41:46.306
Mom, hey.

41:47.238 --> 41:48.546
Mama!

41:48.639 --> 41:50.448
What's the matter, dear?

41:52.109 --> 41:53.679
You're still here.

41:53.777 --> 41:56.121
Of course I am. I live here.

42:00.451 --> 42:01.451
There.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.863
I was afraid it was just a dream.

42:04.788 --> 42:06.893
Then is this also just a dream?

42:09.426 --> 42:10.837
I sure hope not.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.411
Catch.
- Got it.

42:18.502 --> 42:20.311
How many do we have now?

42:22.039 --> 42:23.643
What? Oh, dear!

42:25.075 --> 42:27.282
No. It's the Feather King.

42:29.513 --> 42:31.424
Hurry! Run!

42:33.984 --> 42:36.521
Come here. Hide, quick.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.842
And stay away!

42:52.570 --> 42:55.574
Bill? Why are you here?

42:56.874 --> 42:59.878
I'm paying them back for all the times
these little rascals brought me

42:59.977 --> 43:01.684
all the Way out here.

43:01.779 --> 43:03.087
Where's the Feather King?

43:04.081 --> 43:05.856
In a place Where he can't hurt anyone.

43:05.950 --> 43:08.021
- But who's in charge?
- No one.

43:08.118 --> 43:09.495
- Come on.
- Where?

43:09.587 --> 43:11.430
You'll see soon enough.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.697
Come on.

43:16.527 --> 43:19.007
- No one's deciding What to do?
- No one.

43:19.096 --> 43:22.168
- What happened to Mora?
- Who cares?

43:22.266 --> 43:25.475
You said you didn't believe in her
anyway and neither do I.

43:25.603 --> 43:28.311
- Can we go get Dad?
- What's Wrong with being here?

43:28.405 --> 43:31.682
- It's just...
- My son misses his father.

43:31.809 --> 43:33.379
Then he should see him.

43:33.477 --> 43:36.924
- I have an idea.
- Will you help me find my dad?

43:37.014 --> 43:39.051
- We'll see.
- Did you hear that, Mom?

43:39.149 --> 43:41.959
We're gonna find Dad.
We're gonna get to see him.

43:42.553 --> 43:46.160
I don't know who you are but you'd
better not be tricking my son.

43:46.256 --> 43:48.827
Of course not. I wouldn't dream of it.

43:48.926 --> 43:53.671
Your son helped me greatly, madam.
He has been invaluable to me.

43:54.031 --> 43:55.908
This is my chance to help him out.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.604
He must return to his father.

43:57.701 --> 44:00.011
He doesn't belong here
and you know it.

44:00.104 --> 44:04.553
But aren't you happy to see him?
It wouldn't hurt him to know that.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.918
- But he...
Doesn't belong here. Nonsense!

44:07.011 --> 44:10.049
Everyone belongs here.
I'll open the floodgates.

44:10.147 --> 44:12.593
Your son is the one
who gave me the idea.

44:12.683 --> 44:14.185
I don't like it.

44:24.795 --> 44:26.968
Did you really build all these houses?

44:27.064 --> 44:30.375
Yes, I did. But it's not my fault
they are so ugly.

44:31.235 --> 44:33.237
Feather King and the others did that.

44:34.104 --> 44:36.311
Let's try something new.
See that?

44:36.407 --> 44:38.751
- See What?
- You have to look closer.

44:38.842 --> 44:41.118
- But there's nothing here.
Exactly!

44:41.211 --> 44:43.248
Because the Feather King is gone.

44:43.347 --> 44:44.985
- So Where did he go?
- Who cares?

44:45.082 --> 44:47.722
He's gone and that's What's important.

44:47.818 --> 44:49.695
I decide What happens
from now on.

44:49.787 --> 44:52.597
But wait. You said
that no one was going to decide.

44:52.690 --> 44:57.264
Yes, and I've decided that
no one will decide anything anymore.

44:58.796 --> 45:00.798
- Did you make that too?
- Indeed.

45:00.898 --> 45:02.639
You're really good at building stuff.

45:02.733 --> 45:06.237
Thank you! It's about time
someone noticed my handiwork.

45:06.670 --> 45:08.411
Where is the Feather King?

45:08.772 --> 45:12.242
Can we just forget about that
sour, old lemon for a While?

45:12.342 --> 45:14.948
Something your boy said
gave me the idea.

45:15.045 --> 45:17.423
"L don't believe in Mora."

45:17.514 --> 45:19.790
It sounded like crazy talk at first.

45:19.883 --> 45:22.887
But then I thought to myself,
"Wait, why not?"

45:22.986 --> 45:26.593
All these crazy rules
are just Mora's rules after all.

45:26.690 --> 45:28.192
And if you don't believe in Mora

45:28.292 --> 45:32.331
then you don't have to believe
in any of her rules either.

45:32.429 --> 45:34.306
So, I stopped believing too.

45:34.398 --> 45:36.207
I tried to explain it
to the Feather King

45:36.300 --> 45:37.938
but he wouldn't listen to me.

45:38.035 --> 45:42.108
And then I thought, "Bill,
don't waste your time oh him."

45:42.206 --> 45:43.776
- Then What happened?
- This!

45:43.874 --> 45:47.048
- I stuffed him in a box.
- The Feather King is in there?

45:47.144 --> 45:48.646
You cannot do that, Bill.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.521
I can do whatever I want.

45:50.614 --> 45:53.220
Isn't it dangerous
for him to be in there?

45:53.383 --> 45:55.590
He'll be fine.
You wanna go back to the Fogbanks?

45:55.686 --> 45:56.686
No!

45:56.787 --> 45:59.563
We'll leave him in the box for now.
Who cares?

45:59.656 --> 46:01.329
- Let me out!
- Be quiet.

46:01.425 --> 46:03.166
You tricked me!

46:03.260 --> 46:05.536
Let me out.
You'll ruin everything.

46:05.629 --> 46:07.267
Blah, man, man, man, man.

46:07.364 --> 46:08.434
And...

46:09.833 --> 46:11.176
You traitor!

46:12.703 --> 46:15.809
<i>New what'?
- Yeah, I had the same thought.</i>

46:15.906 --> 46:18.819
Now What? And then I thought,

46:18.909 --> 46:20.718
"Why don't we have a big party?"

46:20.811 --> 46:24.122
'A party?
'YES, a party!

46:24.214 --> 46:27.787
To show everybody that the Kingdom of
the Feather King can be a fun place.

46:27.885 --> 46:30.161
- I love parties!
Exactly!

46:30.287 --> 46:32.824
- And What do they have at parties?
- Soda pop!

46:32.923 --> 46:35.369
Yes! Delicious, bubbly soda pop.

46:35.459 --> 46:36.938
- And music.
- Yes.

46:37.027 --> 46:39.105
- And What else?
Dust What do you think you're doing?

46:39.129 --> 46:40.130
What do you mean?

46:40.230 --> 46:43.677
Your mom doesn't believe
that we can throw a fun party.

46:43.767 --> 46:45.371
What? But why not?

46:45.502 --> 46:47.948
- What else?
- I know! Acrobats.

46:48.038 --> 46:49.449
And sword swallowers.

46:49.540 --> 46:51.520
- Yes!
- And What about their tickets?

46:51.608 --> 46:53.417
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.

46:53.510 --> 46:57.219
- You're disturbing the balance.
- Listen. I'm not disturbing anything.

46:57.314 --> 47:00.488
I'm fixing things to make them
work even better.

47:03.220 --> 47:04.220
There.

47:08.192 --> 47:09.398
Gee, thanks!

47:11.929 --> 47:14.273
For you and you.

47:17.201 --> 47:19.044
Special delivery.

47:22.472 --> 47:24.076
A gift for you.

47:27.644 --> 47:29.646
Here you are. And you.

47:29.780 --> 47:31.817
- What's this?
- What's that?

47:35.219 --> 47:37.324
Not very fun for a party.

47:37.421 --> 47:39.367
<i>Can we have cake too'?</i>

47:42.759 --> 47:44.329
- Here you go.
- What is it?

47:44.428 --> 47:46.066
See you there.

47:46.163 --> 47:47.904
And be sure to bring the cake.

47:53.604 --> 47:56.881
Mom, do you think Bill was able
to find everything?

47:56.974 --> 47:59.648
It may not work out.
Try not to get your hopes up.

47:59.743 --> 48:03.418
You sound just like Dad.
He doesn't believe in anything either.

48:03.513 --> 48:05.993
But here I am. With you.

48:06.083 --> 48:08.620
And Dad will come too,
if Bill says so.

48:15.259 --> 48:17.933
- What did you do?
- It Wasn't me. It was Bill.

48:18.028 --> 48:20.634
He's having a party.
He invited everyone.

48:20.731 --> 48:23.678
He pulled the tickets out of the well
all by himself.

48:24.601 --> 48:26.512
Please, that's complete nonsense.

48:27.537 --> 48:30.108
He said there's gonna be acrobats
and sword swallowers.

48:30.207 --> 48:32.847
I can't wait. Look at the cake!

48:33.977 --> 48:37.117
Hold on there. You're not even
supposed to be here.

49:08.245 --> 49:09.724
What are they doing?

49:14.484 --> 49:15.724
I don't know.

49:45.549 --> 49:46.755
Isn't that the janitor?

49:46.850 --> 49:48.852
If that's it, then I'm going home.

49:48.952 --> 49:50.590
Listen up, everyone.

49:52.689 --> 49:55.431
<i>Beginning today, it ends.</i>

49:55.525 --> 49:57.937
Ends? What do you mean?
- What ends?

49:58.028 --> 50:00.565
<i>No more being bored. it ends.</i>

50:00.697 --> 50:01.732
Okay.

50:02.265 --> 50:04.040
Who does he think he is?

50:04.434 --> 50:06.607
<i>There will be no more sulking.</i>

50:06.837 --> 50:09.943
- I don't sulk.
- There is no reason to be happy.

50:10.040 --> 50:13.613
<i>And no more walking around,
doing nothing. That ends too.</i>

50:13.710 --> 50:15.230
I don't like the sound of that at all.

50:15.312 --> 50:17.292
<i>But most of all, no more rules!</i>

50:18.749 --> 50:20.228
What ever does he mean?

50:20.317 --> 50:22.854
- That <i>sounds</i> good <i>to me.
- The Kingdom of the Feather King</i>

50:22.953 --> 50:26.025
<i>is now the land of opportunity!</i>

50:26.123 --> 50:27.693
<i>You, boy.</i>

50:28.058 --> 50:29.560
- You mean me?
- Come here.

50:29.659 --> 50:32.139
- What do you Want?
- You'll see.

50:35.065 --> 50:36.373
<i>Get ready!</i>

50:42.005 --> 50:44.679
Dad?
- ls that really possible?

50:44.775 --> 50:47.346
<i>Starting today,
the floodgates are open.</i>

50:47.444 --> 50:49.822
<i>Anyone can come here if they want to.</i>

50:51.281 --> 50:53.989
Would you like to say something
to your son?

50:54.084 --> 50:56.428
<i>Where have you been?
How did you get here?</i>

50:56.520 --> 50:59.194
- Where are we?
- In Bill's Kingdom!

51:02.726 --> 51:03.966
Take it away!

51:13.537 --> 51:16.882
And best of all, guess What,
Mom's here too.

51:18.208 --> 51:20.848
Who is that? His voice sounds...

51:20.944 --> 51:22.355
- It's Bill.
- How you doin'?

51:22.446 --> 51:25.052
I... I don't understand
What's going on.

51:25.148 --> 51:27.219
Basically, the Feather King is gone.

51:27.317 --> 51:29.763
Bill is at the helm and now
the Kingdom of the Feather King

51:29.853 --> 51:31.833
is open to everyone.

51:31.922 --> 51:34.960
Ali's well that ends well.
No one has to hide anymore.

51:36.059 --> 51:38.767
- This is all wrong.
- Come on, Mom.

51:44.801 --> 51:49.341
<i>And just like I imagined,
we were all together again.</i>

51:50.140 --> 51:53.610
<i>Me, Mom and Dad.</i>

52:06.556 --> 52:08.035
<i>Always</i>

52:08.158 --> 52:11.264
<i>Forever I'm with you</i>

52:11.361 --> 52:17.312
<i>I'll never be apart from you</i>

52:19.836 --> 52:26.549
<i>I'm trusting, believing
I'm hoping, receiving</i>

52:26.643 --> 52:31.683
<i>A love I can? deny</i>

52:35.919 --> 52:39.264
<i>I'm chasing your life
Chasing your love</i>

52:39.356 --> 52:42.826
<i>Chasing the only one I know of</i>

52:42.926 --> 52:48.308
<i>Whose love is timeless</i>

52:49.366 --> 52:52.904
<i>I'm chasing your life
Chasing your love</i>

52:53.003 --> 52:56.280
<i>I'm chasing the only one I know of</i>

52:56.373 --> 53:01.152
<i>Whose love is timeless</i>

53:20.864 --> 53:23.174
Mom, Dad. Wake up.

53:24.768 --> 53:26.247
What's going on?

53:27.204 --> 53:29.411
The river. ls it usually like this?

53:30.140 --> 53:32.450
I've never seen anything like it.

53:32.542 --> 53:35.455
We have to ask Bill.
He knows everything.

53:37.547 --> 53:40.858
Oh, no. Something is very wrong.

53:40.951 --> 53:42.555
We have to find Bill.

53:52.495 --> 53:55.601
My brother, my sisters,

53:55.699 --> 53:58.771
- and my cousin.
- Yes, I'll do What I can.

53:58.868 --> 54:00.939
Okay, got it. Next up.

54:01.037 --> 54:02.209
Who's next?

54:02.706 --> 54:04.708
My mother's bottle house is flooded.

54:04.808 --> 54:07.414
- Move to higher ground then.
- But that's hot all.

54:07.510 --> 54:09.512
Something is terribly wrong.

54:09.613 --> 54:12.184
Wrong? What do you mean?
Look how happy everyone is!

54:12.282 --> 54:15.354
- Is everyone happy"?
- Yes!

54:16.653 --> 54:18.189
Very happy!

54:18.288 --> 54:20.234
- Voila..
- Can you explain to us

54:20.323 --> 54:23.532
why the ground is shaking
and everything is now flooded?

54:23.627 --> 54:25.300
- Nope.
- No?

54:25.395 --> 54:27.875
No. I don't really feel like it.

54:28.965 --> 54:31.536
Wait, What was that?

54:36.873 --> 54:38.284
It's nothing.

54:42.912 --> 54:44.118
What happened?

54:45.982 --> 54:48.053
It's just a little bit of humidity.

54:48.151 --> 54:51.360
I think that'll be all for today.
Bye bye.

54:54.057 --> 54:56.196
Hey, can't you see somethings wrong?

54:56.293 --> 55:00.639
They don't think anythings Wrong
because everything's fine. So go.

55:02.165 --> 55:04.873
Fine. Okay. Then I'll go.

55:09.906 --> 55:11.579
We gotta do something.

55:24.521 --> 55:26.057
Let me out!

55:30.360 --> 55:32.101
- Wait.
- The Feather King.

55:43.440 --> 55:45.784
Where's Bill? Bill?

55:45.875 --> 55:47.013
Bill?

55:51.348 --> 55:52.827
What in the world have you done?

55:59.656 --> 56:01.033
What is it?

56:01.157 --> 56:03.159
Mora's rules have been broken.

56:03.259 --> 56:04.829
Everything will fall apart.

56:04.928 --> 56:07.875
I Warned you.
Why doesn't anyone ever listen?

56:07.964 --> 56:12.106
If the kingdom sinks into the ocean
we all turn into nothing forever.

56:12.202 --> 56:14.239
- What can we do?
- Get out now.

56:14.337 --> 56:16.112
But how? There's no Way out.

56:16.206 --> 56:18.743
Then I suggest you go and find Bill.

56:18.842 --> 56:20.048
He knows a secret Way.

56:20.143 --> 56:22.487
- Are you coming?
- No, I'm afraid I'm not allowed

56:22.579 --> 56:23.922
to leave my kingdom.

56:24.013 --> 56:25.788
But I could use your rain boots.

56:47.404 --> 56:51.318
Take him with you.
Make sure he comes to no harm.

56:51.408 --> 56:53.820
Come on. We're gonna find Bill.

57:08.324 --> 57:10.201
She Won't answer.

57:10.293 --> 57:12.967
No. You just can't hear her.

57:13.096 --> 57:15.975
- You ruined everything.
Maybe.

57:16.065 --> 57:18.170
Maybe you're a little bit right.

57:18.268 --> 57:21.408
I know Mora will be upset
about everyone with no ticket.

57:21.504 --> 57:23.142
But I will fix it.

57:23.239 --> 57:25.310
Right. And how will you do that?

57:25.408 --> 57:27.354
Well, you just Wait and see.

57:28.378 --> 57:30.289
Listen to me for once, okay?

57:30.380 --> 57:32.621
Only one person here has no ticket.

57:32.715 --> 57:35.423
I'll find it
and everything will be fine.

57:35.518 --> 57:36.895
No!

57:46.296 --> 57:48.606
Found it. Over and out.

57:48.698 --> 57:51.372
You know you can't do that, Bill.

57:51.468 --> 57:52.674
No!

57:52.769 --> 57:54.908
Let go. Let go!

58:03.546 --> 58:04.854
Boy!

58:22.966 --> 58:25.003
Oh, no. no, no, no, no!

58:39.382 --> 58:40.918
Everything is collapsing.

58:41.017 --> 58:43.588
Relax, everything is under control.

58:44.521 --> 58:46.330
Hey, Wasn't that Bill?

58:49.225 --> 58:51.466
- Follow him.
- Everything is fine.

59:01.137 --> 59:02.343
Captain!

59:04.774 --> 59:07.778
We have to get out.
Everything is falling apart.

59:07.877 --> 59:09.447
I'm afraid that is against the rules.

59:09.546 --> 59:12.049
But look. Everything is disappearing.

59:14.017 --> 59:15.860
I just knew it would cause trouble.

59:15.952 --> 59:17.397
We are not going anywhere.

59:17.487 --> 59:20.127
The engine Won't be able
to handle the new tickets.

59:21.057 --> 59:23.003
My dad and I can fix that.

59:23.092 --> 59:25.629
Here, Mom. Come on, Dad. Let's go.

59:44.080 --> 59:45.286
There.

59:51.888 --> 59:53.196
Good, Jonah.

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:01.903
Captain, start the ship.

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:03.136
All right.

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.137
Yes!

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:48.716
It doesn't feel good.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.650
What?

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.422
It's Bill.

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.260
Follow him.

01:00:57.987 --> 01:00:59.227
Typical Bill.

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:04.865
Get lost. This is my exit.

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:13.846
- There it is.
- The exit.

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:15.244
Oh, no.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.520
- Bill, help us!
- Bill!

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.928
Never!

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.065
Get away!

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:43.571
Oh, no!

01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:00.188
I'm coming!

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:21.774
Oh, no.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.434
Oh, no!

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:49.802
Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go!

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.656
Come on! Hurry!

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:10.896
Mom, Dad, come on.

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:15.397
Hurry.

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:24.936
Come on, Mom.

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.979
I'm afraid I can't.

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:42.952
What do you mean?

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:49.760
Come on, Mom.
You have to come with us.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:05.109
I'm afraid it's true.
She can't come with you.

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:06.815
But why not?

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:09.947
Well, she belongs in the Kingdom
of the Feather King.

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:11.992
Her ticket has already burned.

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:14.584
Then all you have to do
is change the rule.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:24.338
You have to go now.

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:26.964
But she'll turn into nothing.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:39.516
You must leave. Before it's too late.

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:47.422
Mommy.

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:49.496
So long! See ya.

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:55.934
Yes, yes, yes.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:19.992
No, no, no!

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:31.767
Oh, no, not again. Let go!
Let go! Let go of me!

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:34.166
Help! Help!

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:45.215
It's the tickets.
Mora wants the tickets.

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.180
Look!

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.600
Jonah, What are you doing?

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:06.567
Jonah, no!
Jonah, no!

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:08.664
Jonah!
- Come back here, son!

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:13.340
Jonah!
- No!

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:55.481
Yes.

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:59.724
Mom, Dad.
We can make Mora happy again.

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:02.227
I have all the tickets. Yes!

01:07:29.645 --> 01:07:30.885
There he is!

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.191
- He did it.
- Yes!

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:38.127
- Oh, no!
- Watch out, Jonah!

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:22.094
Mom!

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:25.799
Jonah.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.877
The stairs are gone.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:36.005
But now they can't get back up.

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:41.250
- What have you done, Bill?
- Nothing!

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:42.685
I didn't do anything.

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:45.349
If only the Feather King were here.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.020
What? It's saying something.

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:55.198
What do you Want?
What are you saying?

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:29.559
I had a discussion with Mora.

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:33.299
I made a promise
to get everybody out of here.

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:35.432
Everyone who doesn't belong.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.674
Come on. Good, that's it. Here we go.

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:45.313
We're going to need your help.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:47.242
My help?

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:49.482
You are the only one
who can build the new exit.

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:53.458
- Why would I do that?
Because you can't always run away.

01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:06.571
All right. Fine.
Perhaps it's just as well.

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:25.786
Ready?

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:34.064
Here you go.

01:11:40.195 --> 01:11:41.367
There.

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:43.772
There you go.

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:46.013
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.907
All the Way up.

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:52.209
Here you go. Keep going.

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:04.956
Okay, here we go.
Everyone up.

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:06.863
All rabbits up.

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:09.836
Follow me. All rabbits up.

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:12.735
You too. Keep going.

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:14.466
I'm gonna miss you.

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:16.872
Dad...

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.310
But I'm right here, Jonah.

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:29.989
- We love you.
- I love you too.

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:33.185
So much. Both of you.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:55.542
I'll keep writing you.
I love you.

01:12:57.406 --> 01:12:58.851
Good bye.

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:05.154
I love you guys.
