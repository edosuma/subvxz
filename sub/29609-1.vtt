00:09.310 --> 00:14.310
(film clacking)
(gentle guitar music)

00:17.724 --> 00:20.974
(upbeat country music)

00:27.274 --> 00:30.524
(lively country music)

01:13.598 --> 01:16.848
(gentle country music)

02:03.046 --> 02:04.296
- Tommy, Tomas!

02:06.675 --> 02:08.829
Come unlock this gate!

02:08.829 --> 02:10.360
(chain rattling)

02:10.360 --> 02:14.033
What are you doing locking
yourself inside your own fence?

02:15.153 --> 02:17.620
(chain rattling)

02:17.620 --> 02:19.539
Well, I'll be dad gum.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.810
- (chuckles) What are you doing, Clifford?

02:21.810 --> 02:23.160
- [Clifford] Doing fine, Tomas?

02:23.160 --> 02:23.993
How are you?

02:23.993 --> 02:24.826
- Bueno.

02:24.826 --> 02:25.659
We're good.

02:27.460 --> 02:29.046
- Is that a fact?

02:29.046 --> 02:31.653
- Well, what is a fact nowadays?

02:33.190 --> 02:34.450
- [Clifford] Well, I
just wanted to come out

02:34.450 --> 02:35.593
and check on you.

02:36.450 --> 02:37.660
- [Tommy] Check on me?

02:37.660 --> 02:39.440
I don't need checking on.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.920
- [Clifford] The whole
gang's worried about you

02:40.920 --> 02:42.873
living out here like some hermit.

02:44.336 --> 02:46.210
- [Tommy] I doubt
they're worried about me.

02:46.210 --> 02:47.760
- [Clifford] Oh, yes, they are.

02:49.772 --> 02:52.355
(birds cawing)

02:56.350 --> 02:58.940
- Hey Clifford, you want a beer?

02:58.940 --> 03:02.360
- No, since I graduated from whiskey A&M,

03:02.360 --> 03:04.720
I've been holding the line.

03:04.720 --> 03:08.355
No more cerveza, doctor's orders.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.430
(horse whinnying)

03:09.430 --> 03:11.380
- Well, if you're not here for a free beer

03:11.380 --> 03:13.250
what brings you out?

03:13.250 --> 03:15.760
- Tommy, I came to check on you.

03:15.760 --> 03:20.320
Nobody sees you anymore but I
can tell from your ice chest

03:20.320 --> 03:24.040
that you've been sneaking
into town buying beer and ice.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.593
Why don't you ever holler?

03:26.453 --> 03:27.663
- I don't know.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.790
- What do you do all day?

03:29.790 --> 03:31.550
Look at this place?
(lively harmonica music)

03:31.550 --> 03:35.400
No running water, no electricity.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.370
Just you and the great outdoors.

03:38.370 --> 03:40.326
What are you doing with a chicken?

03:40.326 --> 03:41.159
(chicken clucking)

03:41.159 --> 03:42.703
- Well, Suzanne gave her to me.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.300
- Just you and the chicken, huh?

03:46.300 --> 03:48.210
- Her name is Blanche.

03:48.210 --> 03:50.793
- Well, at least it's
not a Canadian goose.

03:52.170 --> 03:55.560
Tommy, I've been mowing
your yard for months.

03:55.560 --> 03:59.030
Your neighbors are complaining
I don't edge the sidewalks.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.260
You shouldn't be mowing my yard.

04:01.260 --> 04:04.327
I'll get some young kid to do that for us.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.897
- That's not the point.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.720
The point is that you're moping out here

04:08.720 --> 04:12.610
like a wounded buffalo,
living like a hermit.

04:12.610 --> 04:14.840
Nobody sees you anymore.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.829
- I'm not moping.

04:16.829 --> 04:18.089
- I know, I know.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.500
Listen, Tomas, why don't you come over

04:22.500 --> 04:24.800
to Suzanne's this afternoon?

04:24.800 --> 04:27.480
The whole gang has been asking about you.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.950
- I like it out here.

04:28.950 --> 04:31.810
This country life fits me just fine.

04:31.810 --> 04:35.850
- You and Thoreau, "Live
the life you have imagined"

04:35.850 --> 04:38.687
"Simplify, simplify."

04:38.687 --> 04:41.930
"The world is but a canvas
to your imagination."

04:41.930 --> 04:44.960
- Your memory just amazes me, Clifford.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.680
Do you ever forget anything?

04:46.680 --> 04:49.070
- It's my residual pool.

04:49.070 --> 04:53.720
It's wide as the Atlantic
and only an inch deep.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.730
Forgetting has never been a problem.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.800
Regretting has.

04:57.800 --> 05:01.530
- Yeah, well, you shoulda
had regrets in your youth,

05:01.530 --> 05:04.010
not now when you're
too old to play around.

05:04.010 --> 05:06.947
- Just like my friend Jerry Puckett said,

05:06.947 --> 05:09.347
"Age has done more for my morals

05:09.347 --> 05:11.830
"than all the Sunday
schools in the world."

05:11.830 --> 05:14.700
- What does Melinda
think about your morals?

05:14.700 --> 05:18.190
- (chuckles) Well, she
thinks they're better.

05:18.190 --> 05:21.680
Remarrying Melinda on our anniversary

05:21.680 --> 05:24.650
was the best decision I ever made,

05:24.650 --> 05:27.650
other than marrying
her in the first place.

05:27.650 --> 05:30.813
- Well, she's an angel,
a God-for-sure angel.

05:31.890 --> 05:35.550
Hanging on to you is a
testament to her tenacity.

05:35.550 --> 05:38.180
- Or to my magnetic personality.

05:38.180 --> 05:39.980
- Are you gonna stay for supper?

05:39.980 --> 05:41.950
I'll go catch us a catfish.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.450
- Catfish?

05:43.450 --> 05:44.340
- Yeah, down here
(upbeat country music)

05:44.340 --> 05:46.450
in the pond we got catfish.

05:46.450 --> 05:47.700
They're easy to catch.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.980
One cast, you know, one catfish.

05:50.980 --> 05:52.570
Yeah, I feed 'em dog food.

05:52.570 --> 05:54.200
- Dog food?

05:54.200 --> 05:55.473
I think I'll pass.

05:56.810 --> 05:58.280
- You're more than welcome to stay.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.353
- I think I'll pass.

06:01.610 --> 06:04.580
Listen compadre, I just
wanted to remind you

06:04.580 --> 06:06.890
of Suzanne's happy hour.

06:06.890 --> 06:09.170
Everybody would like to see you.

06:09.170 --> 06:11.870
Come on into town and visit some.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.510
Of course we wouldn't wanna interrupt

06:13.510 --> 06:15.693
your dinner conversations with Blanche.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.360
- Well, there's something to be said

06:18.360 --> 06:20.943
to have a companion
that doesn't talk back.

06:25.373 --> 06:26.520
(Blanche clucking)

06:26.520 --> 06:28.160
- Tommy, next time you're in town

06:28.160 --> 06:32.070
sneaking around buying
beer and ice, holler at me.

06:32.070 --> 06:35.500
This Thoreau business can get outta hand.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.821
You take care, you hear?

06:37.821 --> 06:39.654
- I will and you, too.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.670
- How are you Suzanne?

06:54.670 --> 06:55.503
- Good to see you, Cliff.

06:55.503 --> 06:57.150
- Good to see you.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.603
- Take a load off your feet.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.363
There's water in there, too.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.260
- [Clifford] Thank you.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.110
- You're welcome.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.910
So how's Tommy?

07:13.910 --> 07:16.130
- [Clifford] Oh, he's
as depressed as ever.

07:16.130 --> 07:17.710
- Oh poor Tomas.

07:17.710 --> 07:20.670
- He claims that he likes living alone

07:20.670 --> 07:23.580
like some modern-day Thoreau.

07:23.580 --> 07:26.230
Did you give him a
chicken to cheer him up?

07:26.230 --> 07:28.290
- I did send my little hen out there

07:28.290 --> 07:31.200
that the rooster had been
chasing unmercifully.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.970
- He's named her Blanche.

07:32.970 --> 07:33.890
- Blanche?
(lively country music)

07:33.890 --> 07:35.844
- He hand feeds her,

07:35.844 --> 07:38.590
waits on her hand and foot,

07:38.590 --> 07:42.130
treats her like some long lost soul mate.

07:42.130 --> 07:44.420
I swear they talk to each other.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.190
- What an odd couple.

07:46.190 --> 07:48.690
- It's a sad a state of affairs.

07:48.690 --> 07:51.080
- Well, she's a real beauty.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.865
Maybe she'll make Tommy happy.

07:52.865 --> 07:54.790
(plane engine rumbling)

07:54.790 --> 07:58.033
- Don is saving the planet
from marauding coyotes.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.633
- Well, that sounds like a chore.

08:01.633 --> 08:02.466
(upbeat music)

08:02.466 --> 08:05.780
- Say, Suzanne, can chickens fly?

08:05.780 --> 08:10.473
- Well, Cliff, every evening
my Orpingtons fly to the roost.

08:10.473 --> 08:12.700
- (chuckles) I was just thinking.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.793
- Oh dear, that sounds dangerous.

08:21.590 --> 08:24.000
- [Don] Clifford J.,
you gotta be kidding me.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.730
- [Clifford] I am not kidding you.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.780
This is the airplane that you shoot

08:27.780 --> 08:29.290
coyotes out of, isn't it?

08:29.290 --> 08:30.123
- You bet it is.

08:30.123 --> 08:31.340
This thing'll fly backwards

08:31.340 --> 08:33.250
if I can get the wind just right.

08:33.250 --> 08:36.159
These coyotes anymore have
gotten to where they're so smart

08:36.159 --> 08:37.580
that it's the only way I can get 'em.

08:37.580 --> 08:40.270
- Well, it's perfect for our project.

08:40.270 --> 08:44.310
All you have to do is
throw a couple of chickens

08:44.310 --> 08:47.830
out the window when
you're going real slow.

08:47.830 --> 08:50.100
No spins, no barrel rolls,

08:50.100 --> 08:52.930
no bombing like you did in Vietnam.

08:52.930 --> 08:55.370
Just toss a couple of chickens out.

08:55.370 --> 08:56.567
That's all you have to do.

08:56.567 --> 08:58.920
- That's the craziest thing I ever heard.

08:58.920 --> 09:02.190
- No, it's a bet between Tommy and I

09:02.190 --> 09:06.130
to see whose chicken can fly the furthest

09:06.130 --> 09:08.750
and it's for Tommy's sake, believe me.

09:08.750 --> 09:09.870
- Craziest thing I ever heard.

09:09.870 --> 09:13.880
You guys have been making bets
like this for over 60 years

09:13.880 --> 09:16.650
but I can tell you for sure
this one's gonna take the cake.

09:16.650 --> 09:18.660
- What's stupid about this bet to see

09:18.660 --> 09:20.620
whose chicken can fly the furthest?

09:20.620 --> 09:23.090
- You guys have lost all your marbles.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.830
Don't you know they say this is exactly

09:24.830 --> 09:26.140
how Alzheimer's starts?

09:26.140 --> 09:29.800
- And one more little thing
that I want you to do.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.510
When you're flying up there
(lively country music)

09:31.510 --> 09:35.500
to a thousand feet, reach behind
you and pull some feathers

09:35.500 --> 09:39.730
out of Tommy's chicken so
it doesn't fly so well.

09:39.730 --> 09:40.850
- You gotta be kidding me.

09:40.850 --> 09:41.683
- No!

09:42.550 --> 09:44.040
You need to do this.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.640
I'm serious.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.570
It's for Tommy's sake.

09:47.570 --> 09:48.403
- Wait a minute.

09:48.403 --> 09:52.020
You're telling me for Tommy's
sake I'm pulling feathers

09:52.020 --> 09:55.590
out of Tommy's chickens' butt,
but it's for Tommy's sake?

09:55.590 --> 09:57.820
- Well, I've got to win the bet

09:57.820 --> 10:01.410
but the whole project is for Tommy's sake.

10:01.410 --> 10:05.200
Tommy's won 90% of the
bets that we've ever made

10:05.200 --> 10:08.010
and this is my chance to
double down and catch up.

10:08.010 --> 10:12.400
We're betting 100 United States dollars

10:12.400 --> 10:14.810
on whose chicken can fly the furthest.

10:14.810 --> 10:17.160
- Well, if it's for Tommy, I'll do it.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.300
- Well, we're counting on you, Don Juan.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.800
You're a good man and there
aren't many of us left.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.599

don't you even knock?

15:01.070 --> 15:02.766

How are Melinda and the kiddos?

15:10.200 --> 15:11.740
- They're all doing great.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.850
Melinda's an angel to put up with me.

15:13.850 --> 15:15.710
- It would take an angel!

15:15.710 --> 15:16.930
- Do you mind if I smoke?

15:16.930 --> 15:20.140
- Of course, I mind if you,
put those cancer sticks away.

15:20.140 --> 15:21.580
Those things are gonna kill you!

15:21.580 --> 15:22.810
I've been telling you that.

15:22.810 --> 15:23.720
I thought you quit.

- You've been telling me that

15:24.980 --> 15:27.420
since I was in the eighth grade.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.350
But actually what I came by for

15:29.350 --> 15:31.280
was to talk about our friend.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.560
- About Tommy.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.580
I haven't seen him since Liz's funeral.

15:34.580 --> 15:35.800
- That's why I came by.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.560
Tommy and I are driving to Marfa tomorrow.

15:38.560 --> 15:39.621
Why don't you join us?

15:39.621 --> 15:40.850
- Why are you gonna to Marfa?

15:40.850 --> 15:42.860
- I told Tommy about the new hotel

15:42.860 --> 15:44.520
and he said he wanted to see it.

15:44.520 --> 15:49.520
He's not happy about Marfa
being a postmodern art mecca

15:49.550 --> 15:51.770
for people with skinny jeans.

15:51.770 --> 15:53.430
- He's not alone in that.

15:53.430 --> 15:57.610
- It'll just bring more
weirdos to West Texas.

15:57.610 --> 15:59.560
Next thing you know, the people in Marfa

15:59.560 --> 16:01.340
will be speaking French.

16:01.340 --> 16:03.430
- Donald Judd started it all.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.900
Who would've thought that Marfa

16:04.900 --> 16:07.550
would turn into a postmodern art mecca.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.470
- I've got lines going to my septic tank

16:10.470 --> 16:13.770
that are more artistic
than Donald Judd's cubes.

16:13.770 --> 16:16.300
- You just don't understand
his work, Clifford.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.700
He's a minimalist.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.800
You have to put it into context.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.600
- He's no minimalist.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.680
He owns half the buildings in Marfa.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.080
He has a home in New York City,

16:27.080 --> 16:29.110
a home in Germany.

16:29.110 --> 16:33.100
He's bought a bunch of
ranches in Presidio County.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.635
Tommy's the minimalist.

16:34.635 --> 16:35.700
(Carolyn chuckles)

16:35.700 --> 16:40.130
He's living out there drinking
water out of a horse trough,

16:40.130 --> 16:44.240
got one spoon, one fork, one knife,

16:44.240 --> 16:46.940
one plate, and a fishing pole.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.520
- A fishing pole?

16:48.520 --> 16:51.250
- His dirt tank is full of catfish.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.684
He feeds 'em dog food

16:52.684 --> 16:53.517
(Carolyn chuckling)

16:53.517 --> 16:55.080
and he talks to his chicken.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.320
- He talks to a chicken?

16:56.320 --> 16:59.280
- Yes, he named the chicken Blanche.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.560
Wouldn't surprise me if he
turned into a Buddhist monk.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.210
- He's just missing Liz.

17:04.210 --> 17:05.896
You know this is hard for him.

17:05.896 --> 17:08.040
- I know, I know

17:08.040 --> 17:11.869
but Tommy's not designed to be a recluse.

17:11.869 --> 17:14.042
He needs to be around his friends.

17:14.930 --> 17:17.400
That's why you need to
come to Marfa with us.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.770
- Maybe I will.

17:18.770 --> 17:20.740
It's been a long time
since the three of us

17:20.740 --> 17:22.680
kicked around together, Clifford.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.347
- Since high school.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.290
- But we did have some fun, didn't we?

17:26.290 --> 17:27.190
- Yes, we did.

17:27.190 --> 17:29.330
All I ever wanted to do in high school

17:29.330 --> 17:31.150
was get into your knickers.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.870
Nothing I tried worked.

17:32.870 --> 17:34.590
That's why I started smoking.

17:34.590 --> 17:36.680
- Don't blame me for your bad habits.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.460
- Why didn't you marry me or Tommy

17:38.460 --> 17:40.870
instead of that worthless Lester?

17:40.870 --> 17:44.760
Here I was a future
attorney, a man of the bar.

17:44.760 --> 17:47.010
Tommy was a successful rancher.

17:47.010 --> 17:49.370
Either one of us would have
been better than Lester.

17:49.370 --> 17:52.477
- You know I could never
choose between you and Tommy

17:52.477 --> 17:54.556
and I sure couldn't handle you both.

17:54.556 --> 17:55.389
(Clifford chuckling)

17:55.389 --> 17:57.450
Anyway, Lester's awful good looking.

17:57.450 --> 18:00.420
- Well, he's bald as a cue ball now

18:00.420 --> 18:02.270
and he's on his fourth wife.

18:02.270 --> 18:03.670
You're lucky it didn't last.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.290
- Yeah, but I have my beautiful children

18:07.290 --> 18:09.270
and my grandbaby Ryan.

18:09.270 --> 18:10.960
I have no regrets.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.933
- Ah, regrets are my department.

18:12.933 --> 18:13.766
(Carolyn chuckles)

18:13.766 --> 18:14.920
I'll pick you up Friday?

18:14.920 --> 18:16.590
- Okay, what time?

18:16.590 --> 18:17.660
- 'Bout 10:30.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.470
And don't wear too many clothes.

18:19.470 --> 18:21.433
We may play some strip dice.

18:22.630 --> 18:25.210
- [Carolyn] You always lost
but we'll stop the game

18:25.210 --> 18:27.960
before we get too
embarrassed this time, okay?

18:27.960 --> 18:28.793
Remember?
(lively country music)

18:28.793 --> 18:33.230
- I remember how y'all
left me out of high and dry

18:33.230 --> 18:37.238
halfway to Marfa in nothing
but my boxers and one boot.

18:37.238 --> 18:38.967
(Carolyn laughing)

18:38.967 --> 18:40.114
Hasta lumbago.

18:40.114 --> 18:40.947
- Okay.

18:42.218 --> 18:43.533
Adios, Clifford.

18:57.420 --> 18:59.870
- Hey, you're getting to
be a regular around here.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.400
- Well, somebody's gotta keep you

19:01.400 --> 19:03.070
on the straight and normal.

19:03.070 --> 19:05.343
Besides I brought you some presents.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.200
- All right, a six pack of beer.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.630
I know what to do with that.

19:09.630 --> 19:12.540
- Well, since I quit
drinking you're the one

19:12.540 --> 19:15.670
that's gotta keep the beer
distributors in business.

19:15.670 --> 19:17.330
- What's this?

19:17.330 --> 19:20.560
- [Clifford] Some dog
food for your catfish?

19:20.560 --> 19:21.910
- That'll keep 'em barking.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.393
Chicken scratch?

19:28.282 --> 19:29.610
- It's for Blanche.

19:29.610 --> 19:31.810
I been thinking about Blanche.

19:31.810 --> 19:33.750
- You've been thinking about Blanche?

19:33.750 --> 19:36.140
What in the world are you
thinking about Blanche for?

19:36.140 --> 19:40.150
- I've been thinking about
how far Blanche can fly.

19:40.150 --> 19:41.930
- Blanche can fly?

19:41.930 --> 19:44.780
- Tomas, since we've been betting,

19:44.780 --> 19:47.320
you won about 90% of the bets

19:47.320 --> 19:50.140
ever since that we bet a quarter

19:50.140 --> 19:53.360
on whose chinch bug
would uncurl the first.

19:53.360 --> 19:58.070
You could retire on the
bets you've won from me.

19:58.070 --> 19:59.260
- Maybe so.

19:59.260 --> 20:02.470
- And I figured out a
way to get my money back.

20:02.470 --> 20:07.230
I'm gonna bet you $100 that my chicken

20:07.230 --> 20:10.020
can outfly your old Blanche.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.706
- You don't even have a chicken.

20:11.706 --> 20:12.700
- Now, how do you know?

20:12.700 --> 20:15.530
I may be the boss of a chicken syndicate.

20:15.530 --> 20:19.770
The Flying Leghorns,
the Dominating Dominics,

20:19.770 --> 20:22.093
the Roaring Rhode Island Reds.

20:23.799 --> 20:26.480
- What in the world are you
talking about, Clifford?

20:26.480 --> 20:27.910
Flying chickens?

20:27.910 --> 20:30.600
- Well, it's better than talking chickens

20:30.600 --> 20:33.530
where you sit and have
conversations with Blanche

20:33.530 --> 20:36.430
while y'all eat catfish and dog food.

20:36.430 --> 20:38.330
- We don't eat dog food.

20:38.330 --> 20:40.050
That's for the fish.

20:40.050 --> 20:42.920
- After I left the other
day I got to thinking

20:42.920 --> 20:45.850
about all the bets that you've won from me

20:45.850 --> 20:49.400
over the years and it's just not fair

20:49.400 --> 20:52.330
to enrich a good friend like you

20:52.330 --> 20:54.073
with my life savings.

20:55.158 --> 20:58.113
- Well, I guess I have to ask you.

20:58.970 --> 21:02.370
What kinda harebrained idea
you got dreamed up this time?

21:02.370 --> 21:07.370
- I talked to our old
Vietnam vet buddy Don Juan

21:07.610 --> 21:10.670
and he'll take our
chickens up a thousand feet

21:10.670 --> 21:14.160
in his airplane and toss them out

21:14.160 --> 21:19.160
and the chicken that flies
the furthest wins $100.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.660
- Oh Lord.

21:20.660 --> 21:23.330
- Thomas, all chickens can fly.

21:23.330 --> 21:24.333
Just ask Suzanne.

21:25.230 --> 21:26.730
And there's one other thing.

21:26.730 --> 21:27.820
- Oh Lord.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.380
- I want you to go to
Marfa with me tomorrow.

21:30.380 --> 21:32.480
- I don't need to go to Marfa.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.660
- I didn't say need.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.830
You ain't gonna believe
what the artists have built,

21:37.830 --> 21:40.080
smack dab downtown.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.740
- In downtown Marfa?

21:41.740 --> 21:44.290
- A new four-story hotel.

21:44.290 --> 21:47.960
Looks like a Donald Judd
cube with 50,000 acres

21:47.960 --> 21:50.460
of free parking in any direction.

21:50.460 --> 21:53.560
I'll pick you up at 11 if
Blanche can do without you

21:53.560 --> 21:54.680
for a few hours.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.610
- Clifford, you're 3/4 crazy.

21:57.610 --> 22:01.030
- [Clifford] Well a friend
in need is a friend indeed.

22:01.030 --> 22:02.303
I'll see you manana.

22:03.270 --> 22:04.779
- Adios.

22:04.779 --> 22:05.674
(upbeat music)

22:05.674 --> 22:08.591
(Blanche clucking)

22:15.140 --> 22:18.640
- Cliff, I said a chicken
could fly to the roost.

22:18.640 --> 22:22.260
I didn't say you could drop
'em from a thousand feet.

22:22.260 --> 22:24.593
- It's not flying, it's gliding.

22:26.290 --> 22:29.920
What if I borrow that old
self-important rooster of yours.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.860
You say he's always pestering your hens.

22:32.860 --> 22:35.363
Let's give the girls a little vacation.

22:37.024 --> 22:39.720
Okay, okay, I wasn't gonna do this

22:39.720 --> 22:43.720
but I'll cut you in
for 15% of the winnings

22:43.720 --> 22:45.920
as the rooster's agent.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.510
What do you think about that?

22:47.510 --> 22:51.120
- Clifford, seems like
I've got $200 invested

22:51.120 --> 22:55.380
in these chickens and
you're offering me $15.

22:55.380 --> 22:56.780
- Well, it's not for me.

22:56.780 --> 22:58.070
It's for Tommy.

22:58.070 --> 22:59.210
Trust me on this.

22:59.210 --> 23:01.950
- If it'll help Tommy out of his funk,

23:01.950 --> 23:03.440
I'm all in for it.

23:03.440 --> 23:08.440
But if anything happens to
my roosters or my chickens

23:09.500 --> 23:11.900
I hold you personally responsible.

23:11.900 --> 23:14.250
- Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.

23:14.250 --> 23:15.083
- Good.

23:22.161 --> 23:26.210
(horn honking)
(lively country music)

23:26.210 --> 23:27.690
- Where's Tommy?

23:27.690 --> 23:28.523
- Hop in.

23:28.523 --> 23:30.060
We're gonna pick him up at his ranch.

24:00.677 --> 24:03.760
- [Carolyn] Good to see that old boy.

24:07.753 --> 24:09.077
- [Tommy] Hey, Carolyn.

24:09.077 --> 24:10.590
- Tom.
- Been a long time.

24:10.590 --> 24:11.811
I didn't know you were coming.

24:11.811 --> 24:12.894
- You didn't?

24:13.840 --> 24:17.390
- Tommy, Carolyn said she
wanted to see the hotel, too.

24:17.390 --> 24:19.140
- Well, that'll be okay with me.

24:19.140 --> 24:20.440
- Say, do you mind driving?

24:20.440 --> 24:23.205
My gimpy knee's acting up on me.

24:23.205 --> 24:24.670
- Well, I can do that.
(lively country music)

24:24.670 --> 24:25.503
Let's go.

24:31.803 --> 24:35.053
(gentle country music)

24:37.560 --> 24:39.370
- Remember when you guys
brought me duck hunting

24:39.370 --> 24:41.660
out here that time and
crawled on our belly

24:41.660 --> 24:43.640
and on the count of three you stood up

24:43.640 --> 24:45.890
and shot enough ducks
for Thanksgiving dinner?

24:45.890 --> 24:47.190
- Yeah, and we cut high card to see

24:47.190 --> 24:49.100
who had to go get the dead ducks

24:49.100 --> 24:50.452
and I near caught pneumonia.

24:50.452 --> 24:52.877
(all laughing)

24:52.877 --> 24:54.900
- [Tommy] Well, if you woulda
died that woulda saved us

24:54.900 --> 24:55.733
a lotta trouble.

24:55.733 --> 24:57.910
- Oh.
- Tom!

24:57.910 --> 24:58.813
- It's the truth!

24:58.813 --> 24:59.783
- [Carolyn] (chuckles) Yes.

25:01.060 --> 25:01.893
Yeah.

25:03.940 --> 25:07.680
Remember all the dreams we had
and the crazy things we did,

25:07.680 --> 25:10.210
driving around getting in trouble?

25:10.210 --> 25:12.250
- [Clifford] We're not
too old to get in trouble.

25:12.250 --> 25:13.700
What'd you have in mind?

25:13.700 --> 25:16.754
- I remember having the
biggest crush on both of you.

25:16.754 --> 25:18.900
- Yeah, Clifford and I used to have a bet

25:18.900 --> 25:20.973
to see who was gonna marry you.

25:21.907 --> 25:23.074
We both lost that one.

25:23.074 --> 25:23.907
(Carolyn chuckling)

25:23.907 --> 25:25.330
- That's true.

25:25.330 --> 25:28.290
- The truth is I loved
you both and I still do.

25:28.290 --> 25:30.710
Being around you both makes me so happy,

25:30.710 --> 25:33.030
you and your crazy bets.

25:33.030 --> 25:34.840
Remember the time we were
out here dove hunting

25:34.840 --> 25:36.910
and you had to bet on whose feather

25:36.910 --> 25:38.530
was gonna hit the ground last

25:38.530 --> 25:40.227
and I had to be the referee?

25:40.227 --> 25:41.660
- And I won that one.

25:41.660 --> 25:44.450
- And the time you two bet on
who would win a bicycle race

25:44.450 --> 25:46.950
and Clifford showed up with
the lawnmower motor rigged

25:46.950 --> 25:48.300
to his back tire.

25:48.300 --> 25:50.771
- Well, I can still remember
him hittin' that pothole.

25:50.771 --> 25:52.370
(chuckles) I could see it now.

25:52.370 --> 25:55.320
- He flew over handlebars
30 miles an hour.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.053
How he ever landed on
his feet is a miracle.

25:58.970 --> 26:01.540
- It took me a quarter mile to slow down.

26:01.540 --> 26:04.374
My first ride musta been 30 yards long.

26:04.374 --> 26:05.250
(Carolyn chuckling)

26:05.250 --> 26:07.840
- He still never did
reach the finish line.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.327
I won that one, too.

26:09.327 --> 26:10.420
- You did.

26:10.420 --> 26:11.630
- And Carolyn, you won't believe

26:11.630 --> 26:14.180
what Clifford dreamed up this time.

26:14.180 --> 26:15.230
You wanna tell her?

26:15.230 --> 26:18.770
- I've been thinking about all
the money I've lost to Tommy

26:18.770 --> 26:22.840
a dollar at a time and it's
been weighing on my mind.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.900
- Uh oh, here we go again.

26:24.900 --> 26:27.260
Clifford, will you ever stop betting?

26:27.260 --> 26:28.980
- Life is just a bet.

26:28.980 --> 26:33.040
You should never take
yourself or life too seriously

26:33.040 --> 26:35.770
'cause you're not gonna
get out of it alive anyway.

26:35.770 --> 26:38.327
- Sometimes the road
can get a little rocky.

26:38.327 --> 26:41.190
- "Sweet are the uses of adversity."

26:41.190 --> 26:43.890
So we've all had a few bumps in the road.

26:43.890 --> 26:45.253
- Some more than others.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.400
- I'll never bet on the number of bumps.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.160
- No.
- Amen.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.690
Do you know what Clifford bet me now?

26:53.690 --> 26:55.010
Yeah, Clifford you tell her.

26:55.010 --> 26:57.591
- Tommy bet me that his Blanche

26:57.591 --> 26:59.243
could outfly my Red Baron.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.520
- I haven't made you a bet.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.480
- What in the world are
you two talking about?

27:04.480 --> 27:08.470
- Tomas, tell Carolyn about
your new girlfriend Blanche.

27:08.470 --> 27:10.870
He's fallen in love with Blanche.

27:10.870 --> 27:13.140
They live alone in the great outdoors

27:13.140 --> 27:15.720
there to enjoy the simple life

27:15.720 --> 27:17.570
and the grandeurs of nature.

27:17.570 --> 27:19.820
- Tommy is Blanche your chicken?

27:19.820 --> 27:22.350
Clifford told me Suzanne
gave you a chicken.

27:22.350 --> 27:27.320
- Tommy and Blanche eat
together, they talk together.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.130
Now, Blanche is a good-looking chicken

27:29.130 --> 27:32.342
and I think the relationship's platonic.

27:32.342 --> 27:35.480
(all chuckling)

27:35.480 --> 27:37.270
- Oh Clifford, what's the bet?

27:37.270 --> 27:38.847
What have you dreamed up this time?

27:38.847 --> 27:42.920
- $100 for whose chicken
can glide the furthest.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.450
Winner take all.

27:44.450 --> 27:45.283
- What?

27:45.283 --> 27:49.380
- Don is gonna take Tommy's
Blanche and my Red Baron

27:49.380 --> 27:53.120
up in an airplane and drop
'em out at a thousand feet.

27:53.120 --> 27:57.220
Whichever one glides
the furthest wins $100.

27:57.220 --> 27:59.510
- Clifford, you're not
gonna throw chickens

27:59.510 --> 28:00.720
out of an airplane!

28:00.720 --> 28:01.700
That's cruel!

28:01.700 --> 28:03.070
- We're not throwing babies
(lively harmonica music)

28:03.070 --> 28:04.150
out of an airplane.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.400
- You better not be
throwing chickens either.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.450
- Carolyn, you amaze me.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.210
Chickens have wings, don't they?

28:10.210 --> 28:11.470
- I'm serious.

28:11.470 --> 28:13.297
- Well, I haven't made the bet anyway.

28:13.297 --> 28:14.550
- You know you will.

28:14.550 --> 28:16.370
You can never resist him.

28:16.370 --> 28:20.110
- And I can tell you this
and I haven't made any bets

28:20.110 --> 28:22.530
but Blanche can outfly any rooster

28:22.530 --> 28:25.530
that old Clifford can scrounge up.

28:25.530 --> 28:26.960
- [Clifford] That'll be the day.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.840
- [Carolyn] You guys are impossible.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.387

- Yes, it is.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.410
Remember when they filmed "Giant"?

32:02.410 --> 32:04.893
Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor stayed here.

32:06.260 --> 32:08.720
Remember the scene where Rock Hudson

32:08.720 --> 32:10.680
took his daughter-in-law into the diner

32:10.680 --> 32:14.110
and the guy refused to serve
them because she was Hispanic?

32:14.110 --> 32:15.940

32:15.940 --> 32:19.230
Rock Hudson lost the
fight but he won my heart.

32:19.230 --> 32:20.800
- Yeah, I remember that scene.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.397
- Chill Wills was my hero.

32:22.397 --> 32:25.170
His only job was to get drunk with Rock

32:25.170 --> 32:28.232
or to get drunk by himself
if Rock wasn't thirsty.

32:28.232 --> 32:30.970
- (chuckles) Drunks are not heroes.

32:30.970 --> 32:33.980
- James Dean was kind of a hero

32:33.980 --> 32:38.520
till he lost the road race
from the movie set into Marfa.

32:38.520 --> 32:42.420
Aunt June Elkins was driving
a Plymouth station wagon

32:42.420 --> 32:44.673
that Bunk Pfiester had souped up.

32:44.673 --> 32:47.590
(Carolyn and Tommy laughing)

32:47.590 --> 32:50.650
- Tommy, didn't you date
Socorro in high school?

32:50.650 --> 32:52.123
- Yeah, for a little while.

32:53.130 --> 32:54.713
Her folks and my folks they didn't think

32:54.713 --> 32:56.690
it was a very good idea.

32:56.690 --> 33:00.500
You weren't supposed to cross
those divides back then.

33:00.500 --> 33:04.010
- She was beautiful and I was so jealous.

33:04.010 --> 33:04.843
- You were?

33:04.843 --> 33:05.800
- Yeah.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.003
Remember when she came down
with that awful case of measles?

33:10.580 --> 33:11.980
- Yeah, I kinda do.

33:11.980 --> 33:14.740
Yes, I think she missed
school for a couple weeks

33:14.740 --> 33:16.840
and almost went to hospital.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.310
- You guys love me so much.

33:19.310 --> 33:20.740
That was me.

33:20.740 --> 33:23.010
I'm the one that came
down with the awful case

33:23.010 --> 33:26.067
of the measles and was
outta school for two weeks.

33:26.067 --> 33:28.857
- "Doubt thou that stars are fire.

33:28.857 --> 33:32.337
"Doubt that the sun doth move in the sky.

33:32.337 --> 33:34.777
"Doubt that truth be a liar

33:34.777 --> 33:37.970
"but never doubt that we love you."

33:37.970 --> 33:39.520
- [Carolyn] Clifford.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.060
- We love ya.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.820
- Yeah, I love you guys.

33:42.820 --> 33:43.800
- Let's eat.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.380
Keep your wallet in your pocket.

33:45.380 --> 33:46.320
It's my treat.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.297
- How big a T-bone they have here?

33:48.297 --> 33:53.297
- They don't.

(birds chirping)

33:58.332 --> 34:01.749
(bluesy harmonica music)

34:05.610 --> 34:07.610
- Uncle Tommy, why don't
you let me bring you

34:07.610 --> 34:08.603
some clean clothes?

34:09.650 --> 34:12.480
- Why, Miss Maddy, it's
sure good to see you.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.313
What brings you out here?

34:13.313 --> 34:15.280
- Don't you get lonely out here?

34:15.280 --> 34:18.270
- Well, lately I've been
getting a whole lotta company

34:18.270 --> 34:19.993
but it sure is good to see you, Maddy.

34:19.993 --> 34:22.020
- One reason I came
out here was to ask you

34:22.020 --> 34:23.853
about this bet you made with Clifford.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.510
- A bet with Clifford?

34:25.510 --> 34:26.770
I haven't made any bet.

34:26.770 --> 34:30.400
- About dropping chickens out
of an airplane at 10,000 feet?

34:30.400 --> 34:31.802
- Now, where did you hear that?

34:31.802 --> 34:32.635
(gentle country music)

34:32.635 --> 34:33.902
- Look, it's all over Instagram.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.199
- What's Instagram?

34:36.199 --> 34:38.320
- It's all over Facebook, too.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.322
- What what are you talking about?

34:40.322 --> 34:42.199
- I think you should probably call it off.

34:42.199 --> 34:44.489
- I hadn't made any bet with Clifford.

34:44.489 --> 34:46.940
And if I wanna throw a
chicken out of an airplane

34:46.940 --> 34:49.356
or have one for supper,
that's my business.

34:49.356 --> 34:51.193
- (scoffs) Uncle Tommy.

34:56.193 --> 34:59.443
(bluesy country music)

35:31.167 --> 35:34.500
(lively country music)

35:38.517 --> 35:40.173
- Hi, Tommy.

35:40.173 --> 35:41.606
How you doing?

35:41.606 --> 35:42.789
- Hello, Theresa.
- Good to see you.

35:42.789 --> 35:44.763
- Yep, good to see you, too, Theresa.

35:46.040 --> 35:47.690
- Can I get you something?

35:47.690 --> 35:49.840
- Sure, I'll take a
cold one there, please.

35:51.270 --> 35:52.530
- Put that back in your pocket.

35:52.530 --> 35:54.081
This is on me.

35:54.081 --> 35:55.153
- Well, I thank you--

35:55.153 --> 35:57.767
- No, you don't need to do that.
- Oh, oh well.

35:57.767 --> 35:59.436
You gotta keep the doors open.

35:59.436 --> 36:00.480
(Theresa chuckling)

36:00.480 --> 36:03.310
Yeah, yeah I was just passing by.

36:03.310 --> 36:05.203
- I'm so glad you stopped.

36:06.367 --> 36:10.450
- Yeah, things been a little tough lately.

36:10.450 --> 36:12.440
- You're missing Liz, aren't you?

36:12.440 --> 36:14.623
- Yeah, she's one to be missed.

36:15.620 --> 36:16.850
What did you do?

36:16.850 --> 36:19.200
- I joined the Catholic church.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.420
You should talk to Father Rick.

36:21.420 --> 36:22.360
- Father Rick?

36:22.360 --> 36:24.070
But he's not a priest anymore.

36:24.070 --> 36:25.160
And he comes in here?

36:25.160 --> 36:26.930
- He comes in here every Thursday night.

36:26.930 --> 36:27.890
Didn't you know?

36:27.890 --> 36:29.720
- No, I didn't know that.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.893
- His band draws quite a crowd.

36:32.960 --> 36:33.983
- Hello, Tommy.

36:33.983 --> 36:35.310
- Hey.
- How are you these days?

36:35.310 --> 36:37.260
I'm doing good, Father.

36:37.260 --> 36:38.570
- Hey, it's just Rick.

36:38.570 --> 36:41.730
The whole town is talking about your bet.

36:41.730 --> 36:43.630
- Oh, this is crazy.

36:43.630 --> 36:46.800
I hadn't even made a bet and
I got half of Brewster County

36:46.800 --> 36:48.213
mad at me already.

36:49.150 --> 36:50.333
- People are people.

36:51.790 --> 36:54.040
I play music to celebrate the joy in life

36:54.040 --> 36:56.540
and some in the church are saying

36:56.540 --> 36:58.713
it's unbecoming of a priest.

36:59.810 --> 37:02.010
- That's in the eye of
the beholder, isn't it?

37:02.010 --> 37:03.030
- Now.

37:03.030 --> 37:05.183
None of us knows the Lord's plan.

37:06.660 --> 37:08.410
Missing Liz?

37:08.410 --> 37:10.680
- Yeah, yeah things are tough.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.190
- Try prayer, Tommy.

37:12.190 --> 37:13.320
- Prayer?

37:13.320 --> 37:14.270
- Works for me.

37:14.270 --> 37:15.820
- [Theresa] For me, too.

37:15.820 --> 37:18.630
- But you're no longer
in the church, Father.

37:18.630 --> 37:22.470
- I'm still doing the Lord's
work only not in church.

37:22.470 --> 37:24.140
You should come hear our band.

37:24.140 --> 37:26.420
Our new vocalist is terrific.

37:26.420 --> 37:27.980
- Yeah, Theresa told me.

37:27.980 --> 37:29.660
- Why don't you come tonight?

37:29.660 --> 37:31.420
Dancing brings people together

37:31.420 --> 37:34.037
and puts joy in our heart.

37:34.037 --> 37:36.640
- I'm might, well, I just might do that.

37:36.640 --> 37:40.310
- Try prayer, Tommy, and
come listen to our music.

37:40.310 --> 37:41.933
Both can work miracles.

37:43.170 --> 37:45.830
And don't let anybody get
you down about your bet.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.020
I think it's a fun bet.

37:47.020 --> 37:48.133
People are people.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.700
Besides chickens can fly.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.153
- [Tommy] Amen.

37:53.153 --> 37:54.230
Thanks for the beer, Theresa.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.330
- [Theresa] You're welcome, Tommy.

37:55.330 --> 37:57.210
Come back anytime.

37:57.210 --> 37:58.043
- Will do.
- Everything's gonna

37:58.043 --> 37:58.876
be all right.

37:58.876 --> 38:01.167
- All right, thank you.

38:04.216 --> 38:07.383
(gentle guitar music)

38:10.974 --> 38:12.100
(birds chirping)

38:12.100 --> 38:15.170
- [Suzanne] Hey Eddie, I
heard you were in West Texas.

38:15.170 --> 38:16.690
- Hey, Suzita.

38:16.690 --> 38:17.523
Good to see you.

38:20.520 --> 38:22.673
I bought a house in Marfa last month.

38:23.580 --> 38:25.590
Been gone from West Texas 50 years

38:25.590 --> 38:28.130
but I just can't get
West Texas outta my soul.

38:28.130 --> 38:30.010
- Are you still practicing law?

38:30.010 --> 38:32.780
- I'm still representing the
maimed and the forgotten.

38:32.780 --> 38:35.840
Slowing down a little,
trying to smell the roses.

38:35.840 --> 38:36.673
How are you doing?

38:36.673 --> 38:40.350
- You went off to LA,
Eddie, to seek your fortune.

38:40.350 --> 38:42.815
I stayed right here and found mine.

38:42.815 --> 38:43.648
(Suzanne chuckling)

38:43.648 --> 38:44.540
- I'm glad things have been good for you.

38:44.540 --> 38:46.870
LA's has been good for me.

38:46.870 --> 38:48.640
But I miss West Texas.

38:48.640 --> 38:51.090
Say, does Tommy stop by here very often?

38:51.090 --> 38:52.760
- He used to, Eddie,

38:52.760 --> 38:56.220
but he doesn't come by much
anymore since he lost Liz.

38:56.220 --> 38:58.770
- Well a group in Marfa
asked me to represent them.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.830
They heard about Tommy's bet.

39:00.830 --> 39:02.180
- Why are they talking to you

39:02.180 --> 39:04.120
about Clifford and Tommy's bet?

39:04.120 --> 39:06.300
- I told them it was probably just a rumor

39:06.300 --> 39:08.190
but that's why I wanted to talk to Tommy.

39:08.190 --> 39:10.010
- He hadn't been here in a while, Eddie,

39:10.010 --> 39:11.950
but Clifford still sees him.

39:11.950 --> 39:14.130
You want me to tell Clifford to tell Tommy

39:14.130 --> 39:15.290
to get in touch with you?

39:15.290 --> 39:16.530
- Yeah, would you mind?

39:16.530 --> 39:19.010
And please tell him an animal rights group

39:19.010 --> 39:21.440
has talked to me about the bet.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.760
- You gotta be joking.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.110
- If it's just a rumor,
they don't have anything

39:25.110 --> 39:27.950
to worry about but if those
guys are throwing chickens

39:27.950 --> 39:30.660
out of the airplane,
somebody's gotta tell 'em

39:30.660 --> 39:32.310
this is not high school.

39:32.310 --> 39:35.590
And this is not the West
Texas we grew up in.

39:35.590 --> 39:38.510
- It's the same West
Texas I grew up in, Eddie.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.300
Maybe you're the one who's changed.

39:40.300 --> 39:42.950
- It's the times that
have changed, Suzanne.

39:42.950 --> 39:44.463
Time marches on.

39:45.739 --> 39:48.906
(wind chime tinkling)

39:50.903 --> 39:54.236
(lively country music)

40:20.020 --> 40:22.850
- Hello, Jim, take a load off.

40:22.850 --> 40:23.683
- You bet.

40:23.683 --> 40:24.530
Don't mind if I do.

40:26.137 --> 40:27.940
- What in the world brings you out here?

40:27.940 --> 40:29.540
Been a while.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.300
You out hunting banditos?

40:31.300 --> 40:32.250
- No, Tommy.

40:32.250 --> 40:33.170
You're looking good.

40:33.170 --> 40:35.390
You're taking good care of yourself.

40:35.390 --> 40:36.920
- Well, you, too.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.840
Looks like they've been feeding you well.

40:38.840 --> 40:41.780
- Well, I hate to miss a meal, you know.

40:41.780 --> 40:44.520
Feller might blow away and, by George,

40:44.520 --> 40:45.930
drink a little cerveza, too.

40:45.930 --> 40:47.590
- Well, let me offer you one.

40:47.590 --> 40:48.680
- You bet.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.830
Old Matt Dillon had
one every now and then.

40:53.982 --> 40:54.815
- [Tommy] There you go.

40:54.815 --> 40:55.763
We'll open one.
- Thank you.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.796
- Here's to ya.

40:58.796 --> 40:59.629
- Thank you.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.460
(bird cawing)

41:04.460 --> 41:06.740
- Jim, what's on your mind?

41:06.740 --> 41:09.410
This can't just be a social visit.

41:09.410 --> 41:12.410
- Well Tommy, I heard about a
bet 'tween you and Clifford.

41:12.410 --> 41:13.380
Is it true?

41:13.380 --> 41:15.440
- Well, we might, we might not.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.040
What's it to you?

41:17.040 --> 41:20.000
- Well, Tommy, an animal rights group

41:20.000 --> 41:24.010
has filed an injunction
against y'all's bet.

41:24.010 --> 41:26.593
- Animal rights in West Texas?

41:27.800 --> 41:29.350
Filed an injunction?

41:29.350 --> 41:31.630
- Well, I figured you'd say that, Tommy,

41:31.630 --> 41:34.450
and all you gotta do is
tell me there's not any bet

41:34.450 --> 41:36.993
and it'll be over with.

41:40.410 --> 41:42.920
- Well, you could tell
your animal rights friends

41:42.920 --> 41:44.600
to take that piece of paper

41:44.600 --> 41:47.350
and just tell 'em what
they could do with it.

41:47.350 --> 41:48.347
- Well, I know, Tommy.

41:48.347 --> 41:50.960
People are funny these days, you know.

41:50.960 --> 41:53.550
Heck, they're treating
their pets a lot better

41:53.550 --> 41:56.320
than they do their
neighbors and even youngins

41:56.320 --> 41:59.170
are becoming vegetarians nowadays.

41:59.170 --> 42:00.520
- If this don't beat all.

42:00.520 --> 42:04.870
An injunction from a bunch
of animal rights activists.

42:04.870 --> 42:07.190
What's West Texas coming to?

42:07.190 --> 42:08.490
- Judge said deliver it

42:08.490 --> 42:11.020
and I'm just the messenger.

42:11.020 --> 42:14.300
I suggest that you show up.

42:14.300 --> 42:16.220
- This beats all I ever heard.

42:16.220 --> 42:18.300
- Well, Tommy, it's got
(lively country music)

42:18.300 --> 42:22.310
the court date on there
and I suggest you show up

42:22.310 --> 42:25.370
and you'd be wise to bring
a lawyer with you, too.

42:25.370 --> 42:26.830
- A lawyer?

42:26.830 --> 42:29.620
If I wanna throw a cow out the airplane,

42:29.620 --> 42:32.710
I mean, that's my God-given
constitutional right.

42:32.710 --> 42:35.530
- Tommy, I agree with
you, I agree with you.

42:35.530 --> 42:40.530
But, once again, I suggest you
show up, present your case.

42:40.842 --> 42:42.092
- If that don't beat all.

42:49.626 --> 42:52.959
(lively country music)

43:34.349 --> 43:36.317
(people shouting)

43:36.317 --> 43:39.567
(lively country music)

43:55.917 --> 43:57.355
- We love our chickens.

43:57.355 --> 43:58.823
Come on, don't do it.

43:58.823 --> 44:02.216
- [Man] Yeah, those people are crazy.

44:02.216 --> 44:05.299
(people chattering)

44:27.430 --> 44:30.810
- Put down those signs
and take off those hats!

44:30.810 --> 44:34.513
I said put down those signs
and take off those hats!

44:35.960 --> 44:37.613
This is a court of law.

44:37.613 --> 44:38.863
- [Woman] Yeah.

44:42.630 --> 44:46.426
- All rise for the Honorable
Billy Ray Stubblefield.

44:46.426 --> 44:49.509
(slow country music)

44:51.870 --> 44:52.810
- Thank you very much.

44:52.810 --> 44:53.860
You may be be seated.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.470
Welcome to the courtroom this afternoon.

44:57.470 --> 44:59.500
We have an item on the docket

45:00.410 --> 45:05.260
which is an application
for a temporary injunction.

45:05.260 --> 45:08.750
Previously a TRO was denied by the court

45:08.750 --> 45:11.950
but we did set this day for the hearing.

45:11.950 --> 45:16.910
And the case is styled
Blanche and Red Baron,

45:16.910 --> 45:19.630
two living Gallus domesticus

45:19.630 --> 45:22.430
by and through their guardians ad litem

45:22.430 --> 45:24.610
and friends of the court.

45:24.610 --> 45:26.570
They are the petitioners.

45:26.570 --> 45:29.730
The respondents are Tommy Mangrem

45:29.730 --> 45:31.383
and Clifford Hardwick.

45:32.500 --> 45:33.900
Can we have announcements?

45:33.900 --> 45:37.370
- Your Honor, Edward Pfiester
appearing pro hac vice

45:37.370 --> 45:41.060
for the applicant People
for Our Feathered Friends

45:41.060 --> 45:45.867
or PFOFF, pronounced Puff Off.

45:45.867 --> 45:47.460
(audience laughing)

45:47.460 --> 45:50.990
We are seeking a temporary
injunction to prevent

45:50.990 --> 45:54.400
the cruel injury and very untimely death

45:54.400 --> 45:55.768
of two of God's creatures,

45:55.768 --> 45:56.610
(audience laughing)

45:56.610 --> 46:00.740
the named Blanche and the named Red Baron.

46:00.740 --> 46:03.540
Counsel and I have met
and conferred at length

46:03.540 --> 46:04.949
but to no avail.

46:04.949 --> 46:06.557
(audience laughing)

46:06.557 --> 46:09.220
(gavel thudding)

46:09.220 --> 46:11.060
- Order in the court.

46:11.060 --> 46:14.040
I understand that there's a lot of emotion

46:14.040 --> 46:17.290
involved in this case, but
I've got to have decorum

46:17.290 --> 46:20.100
and dignity and just to remind you

46:20.100 --> 46:22.900
we have a little holding cell behind me.

46:22.900 --> 46:24.380
It's about 10 feet square.

46:24.380 --> 46:27.340
It's not air conditioned,
doesn't have any furniture,

46:27.340 --> 46:30.740
and it's not pleasant, but
it is available for use.

46:30.740 --> 46:31.840
Ms. Rogers.

46:31.840 --> 46:34.540
- Thank you, your Honor,
Liz Rogers from Alpine.

46:34.540 --> 46:36.700
I'm appearing on behalf of the respondents

46:36.700 --> 46:38.560
Tommy Mangrem and Clifford Hardwick

46:38.560 --> 46:41.800
also both lifelong
residents of Alpine, Texas.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.110
- Are both parties ready to proceed?

46:44.110 --> 46:45.160
Mr. Pfiester.

46:45.160 --> 46:46.130
- Yes, Your Honor.

46:46.130 --> 46:47.170
- Ms. Rogers?

46:47.170 --> 46:48.250
- We are, Your Honor.

46:48.250 --> 46:50.220
- If there are no preliminary matters,

46:50.220 --> 46:53.780
I'll proceed to hear opening statement.

46:53.780 --> 46:57.670
Mr. Pfiester, as the
petitioner you may proceed.

46:57.670 --> 46:59.530
- Your Honor, a combination amounting

46:59.530 --> 47:02.510
to a civil conspiracy is afoot here.

47:02.510 --> 47:05.100
The purpose of the conspiracy is to profit

47:05.100 --> 47:09.155
from wagering upon the fate
of these two poor chickens.

47:09.155 --> 47:10.120
(audience shouting)
- Upon the fate

47:10.120 --> 47:11.600
of two chickens?

47:11.600 --> 47:12.840
- Yes, Your Honor.

47:12.840 --> 47:16.280
The respondents' plan is
to drop these two chickens

47:16.280 --> 47:19.810
from an airplane flying
at least a thousand feet

47:19.810 --> 47:21.400
above the ground.

47:21.400 --> 47:24.310
It will surely cause the death

47:24.310 --> 47:25.538
of these innocent creatures.

47:25.538 --> 47:27.350
(audience groaning)

47:27.350 --> 47:29.940
We will present irrefutable evidence

47:29.940 --> 47:33.793
that this will cause the
untimely death of both chickens.

47:34.980 --> 47:37.790
- Your Honor, for the respondents,

47:37.790 --> 47:40.270
everybody in this community
knows my clients well

47:40.270 --> 47:42.790
because they've lived
here their whole life.

47:42.790 --> 47:45.620
They are upstanding
citizens of Brewster County

47:45.620 --> 47:47.100
and the Big Bend region.

47:47.100 --> 47:49.430
They are both stalwart supporters

47:49.430 --> 47:51.440
of the Alpine Fighting Bucks.

47:51.440 --> 47:54.150
They both maintain a modicum of sobriety.

47:54.150 --> 47:57.460
And, in fact, Mr. Hardwick
has recently converted

47:57.460 --> 47:59.280
to the ranks of the abstemious.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.864
(audience chuckling)

48:00.864 --> 48:04.090
- Ms. Rogers, what is your
response to these allegations?

48:04.090 --> 48:08.110
- My clients are not members
of some shadow conspiracy

48:08.110 --> 48:09.970
to make a profit from the suffering

48:09.970 --> 48:11.690
of these two noble birds.

48:11.690 --> 48:15.350
And, in fact, I want to
emphasize the word birds.

48:15.350 --> 48:17.490
- I would call them chickens.

48:17.490 --> 48:19.660
- Through the testimony of Al Kauffman,

48:19.660 --> 48:23.310
the Director of the Alpine
Future Farmers of America,

48:23.310 --> 48:27.090
we intend to show that these noble birds

48:27.090 --> 48:30.060
will not suffer injury or death

48:30.060 --> 48:32.700
from the proposed
demonstration of flying skills

48:32.700 --> 48:34.960
that are proposed by my clients.

48:34.960 --> 48:37.590
Nor will they be
traumatized by an exercise

48:37.590 --> 48:39.123
which is natural to their species.

48:39.123 --> 48:41.110
(people chattering)

48:41.110 --> 48:44.350
- Your Honor, we will call El Paso native,

48:44.350 --> 48:46.430
Miss Jody Richardson.

48:46.430 --> 48:49.310
She's an aeronautical engineer
and a practicing lawyer

48:49.310 --> 48:50.461
in Austin, Texas.

48:50.461 --> 48:51.570
(lively country music)

48:51.570 --> 48:53.650
- I've read her curriculum
vitae, Your Honor,

48:53.650 --> 48:56.650
and I have no objections to
Miss Richardson's testimony

48:56.650 --> 48:57.780
as an expert.

48:57.780 --> 48:59.810
- [Eddie] Miss Richardson,
have you had an opportunity

48:59.810 --> 49:02.350
to examine both the chickens in question?

49:02.350 --> 49:03.210
- I have.

49:03.210 --> 49:06.500
- Could you outline for His
Honor the steps you've taken

49:06.500 --> 49:10.500
by way of research,
testing if any, et cetera,

49:10.500 --> 49:13.080
in reaching the conclusions
you've reached in this case?

49:13.080 --> 49:13.913
- Yes.

49:13.913 --> 49:16.200
Just like in most of the
cases that I work on,

49:16.200 --> 49:20.250
I created a custom wind tunnel
to simulate the air pressure

49:20.250 --> 49:22.820
as the object falls through space.

49:22.820 --> 49:26.090
Then I applied the equation
that has been in place

49:26.090 --> 49:29.320
since the 1700s to
determine the relationship

49:29.320 --> 49:32.350
of the density of the
object, the air pressure,

49:32.350 --> 49:34.085
and the velocity at which they are moving.

49:34.085 --> 49:36.180
(audience members shouting)

49:36.180 --> 49:37.980
- Miss Richardson, based on everything

49:37.980 --> 49:40.280
you've testified to do,
everything you've done

49:40.280 --> 49:43.880
in this case so far,
assuming these two chickens

49:43.880 --> 49:47.090
were taken up in an airplane
and dropped at an altitude

49:47.090 --> 49:49.230
of over a thousand feet,

49:49.230 --> 49:51.770
in your professional engineering opinion,

49:51.770 --> 49:53.200
what would happen to them?

49:53.200 --> 49:55.920
- Chickens are meant to
be walking on the ground.

49:55.920 --> 49:57.810
You can tell that by
looking at their feet.

49:57.810 --> 50:00.520
They do not have claws, they do not perch.

50:00.520 --> 50:02.560
The Bernoulli's equation tells us

50:02.560 --> 50:06.130
that the chickens weigh
too much and do not fly.

50:06.130 --> 50:08.200
The longest flight known of a chicken

50:08.200 --> 50:09.770
is 13 seconds.

50:09.770 --> 50:13.395
And they will fall to the Earth
and make a four-foot splat.

50:13.395 --> 50:14.875
- [Audience] Oh!

50:14.875 --> 50:16.471
- [Audience Members] No, no!

50:16.471 --> 50:18.970
(people chattering)

50:18.970 --> 50:23.080
- Your Honor, the respondents
would call Mr. Al Kauffman,

50:23.080 --> 50:26.225
who, like me, is a graduate
of Texas A&M University,

50:26.225 --> 50:29.090
(audience members whooping)

50:29.090 --> 50:31.318
as an expert in avian aerodynamics.

50:31.318 --> 50:32.738
(audience laughing)

50:32.738 --> 50:33.990
(gavel thudding)

50:33.990 --> 50:35.454
He knows his chickens.

50:35.454 --> 50:37.326
(audience laughing)

50:37.326 --> 50:39.620
(gavel thudding)
(audience whooping)

50:39.620 --> 50:41.950
- I object to these outbursts, Your Honor!

50:41.950 --> 50:44.633
They're very, very
prejudicial to my client.

50:45.930 --> 50:49.710
- Mr. Pfiester, this
is the Aggie war whoop

50:49.710 --> 50:53.190
and in Texas it is honored
by time and tradition

50:53.190 --> 50:54.608
and we will permit it.

50:54.608 --> 50:57.608
(audience whooping)

51:00.280 --> 51:03.300
- Mr. Kauffman, in your
esteemed estimation,

51:03.300 --> 51:06.330
if the two said birds were
dropped from an airplane

51:06.330 --> 51:08.710
at an altitude of a thousand feet,

51:08.710 --> 51:11.920
would they simply spread their
wings and fly back to Earth?

51:11.920 --> 51:14.519
- To be exact they would
glide back to Earth.

51:14.519 --> 51:15.777
(audience chattering)

51:15.777 --> 51:19.420
You see, Your Honor, these
are not cage-raised birds.

51:19.420 --> 51:22.066
These are free-range chickens,

51:22.066 --> 51:23.160
(audience laughing)

51:23.160 --> 51:27.350
which makes a huge difference
in their ability to glide.

51:27.350 --> 51:28.640
(audience chattering)

51:28.640 --> 51:30.897
Have you noticed they both have wings?

51:30.897 --> 51:32.525
(audience laughing)

51:32.525 --> 51:34.730
(gavel thudding)

51:34.730 --> 51:37.970
- Are you suggesting, Mr.
Kauffman, that a free-range

51:37.970 --> 51:40.750
chicken could be thrown from
an airplane at a thousand feet

51:40.750 --> 51:43.050
and make it back to Earth safely?

51:43.050 --> 51:43.970
- I am.
(lively country music)

51:43.970 --> 51:46.260
It is their instinctive
ability that defines

51:46.260 --> 51:47.910
their aeronautical abilities.

51:47.910 --> 51:51.056
Could a bird fly up a thousand feet?

51:51.056 --> 51:52.870
No, not at all.

51:52.870 --> 51:55.740
But gliding back down a thousand feet?

51:55.740 --> 51:57.314
That's a bird of a different feather.

51:57.314 --> 52:00.397
(audience laughing)

52:02.040 --> 52:04.370
- And, Mr. Kauffman,
what would be the outcome

52:04.370 --> 52:05.580
of such a glide?

52:05.580 --> 52:07.650
- Both birds, both foul,

52:07.650 --> 52:10.316
would return to Earth completely unharmed.

52:10.316 --> 52:13.399
(audience laughing)

52:14.710 --> 52:16.293
Just the way it is.

52:17.301 --> 52:18.193
Yeah.

52:18.193 --> 52:20.943
(gavel thudding)

52:25.375 --> 52:30.118
(lively country music)
(people chattering)

52:30.118 --> 52:30.951
- Howdy.

52:44.390 --> 52:45.540
- [Bill Ray] So anyway, I will direct my--

52:45.540 --> 52:46.423
- Good to see you, Judge.

52:46.423 --> 52:47.880
How are you doing?

52:47.880 --> 52:48.713
- Fine, Clifford?

52:48.713 --> 52:49.910
How are you doing?

52:49.910 --> 52:51.570
Do you have a drink around here?

52:51.570 --> 52:52.470
- [Clifford] Sure do.

52:52.470 --> 52:54.553
- Something stronger than beer?

52:54.553 --> 52:56.480
- (laughs) Yeah, we do.

52:56.480 --> 52:59.860
Judge, sure was glad that
you saw it our way today.

52:59.860 --> 53:02.260
- Well, Clifford, I'm
sorry I can't talk to you

53:02.260 --> 53:03.093
about the case.

53:03.093 --> 53:05.850
But I reckon I could drink
some of your whiskey.

53:05.850 --> 53:08.040
- Clifford, would you mind
getting us a couple of bourbons?

53:08.040 --> 53:10.610
- Heavens no, Judge Ferguson.

53:10.610 --> 53:12.950
I'd like to propose a toast.

53:12.950 --> 53:13.783
- [Man] Here, here.

53:13.783 --> 53:17.310
- To west Texas where justice rules

53:17.310 --> 53:18.977
and chickens fly!

53:18.977 --> 53:21.253
(group cheering)

53:21.253 --> 53:22.503
- [Woman] Yeah!

53:28.770 --> 53:32.220
- Y'all got the whole dang
town riled up about this bet.

53:32.220 --> 53:34.757
- It did kinda get outta hand, didn't it?

53:34.757 --> 53:35.990
(plane engine rumbling)

53:35.990 --> 53:38.300
- You know, Clifford, I fought in Vietnam

53:38.300 --> 53:41.230
for everybody's right
to protest but right now

53:41.230 --> 53:45.130
we got a bunch of left-wing
hipsters out protesting

53:45.130 --> 53:47.130
a bet about throwing a couple of chickens

53:47.130 --> 53:48.240
out of an airplane.

53:48.240 --> 53:50.960
What in the heck has happened to America?

53:50.960 --> 53:52.113
- Well, America hasn't changed any.

53:52.113 --> 53:56.040
It's just now we slug it out with lawyers

53:56.040 --> 53:58.000
instead of guns.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.190
- Are y'all really gonna
go through with the bet?

54:00.190 --> 54:02.820
- Yes, we won the lawsuit,

54:02.820 --> 54:04.920
but we had one slight change.

54:04.920 --> 54:07.290
We have moved it to the Newberry

54:07.290 --> 54:09.440
which will give you a
little bit more room.

54:09.440 --> 54:12.740
- And won't attract quite
so much attention, I hope.

54:12.740 --> 54:17.370
Now, when is this harebrained
function gonna take place?

54:17.370 --> 54:20.840
- At two o'clock tomorrow
afternoon I'll bring you

54:20.840 --> 54:24.600
the chickens and Sam will show
up to help you drop 'em out.

54:24.600 --> 54:27.030
Now, another little slight change.

54:27.030 --> 54:29.710
Don't pull any feathers
out of Tommy's chicken.

54:29.710 --> 54:33.650
I've become quite attached
to little Blanche.

54:33.650 --> 54:35.430
- So this thing is really gonna happen?

54:35.430 --> 54:36.990
- It is indeed.

54:36.990 --> 54:40.661
You have your jet fired
up and ready to go.

54:40.661 --> 54:43.010
- And I thought you were kidding me.

54:43.010 --> 54:43.877
- Not a whit.

54:45.763 --> 54:49.379
(plane engine rumbling)

54:49.379 --> 54:52.712
(lively country music)

54:56.248 --> 54:59.998
- Look, they're coming
in low from the south!

55:07.002 --> 55:08.702
- [Don And Sam] Drop!

55:08.702 --> 55:09.898
- Look, they dropped 'em!

55:09.898 --> 55:11.464
(group shouting)

55:11.464 --> 55:14.342
- Look at those chickens!

55:14.342 --> 55:16.342
- The rooster's falling!

55:19.379 --> 55:22.560
- Flap your wings, Red Baron!

55:22.560 --> 55:24.394
He's flying like a sack of cement.

55:24.394 --> 55:25.730
- Wanna go double or nothing?

55:25.730 --> 55:27.960
- It's too late for double or nothing.

55:27.960 --> 55:29.074
Look at that Blanche!

55:29.074 --> 55:30.370
(crowd laughing and cheering)

55:30.370 --> 55:33.370
She's gliding better than a buzzard.

55:34.900 --> 55:37.153
You been training that chicken?

55:38.075 --> 55:39.261
- Well...

55:39.261 --> 55:43.511
(audience applauding and cheering)

55:49.413 --> 55:50.246
(Blanche clucking)

55:50.246 --> 55:51.820
- See, I told you chickens could fly.

55:51.820 --> 55:53.130
Why'd you ever doubt me?

55:53.130 --> 55:55.790
- 60 years worth of
experience, that's all.

55:55.790 --> 55:57.450
I'm just glad those chickens made it

55:57.450 --> 55:58.620
or you'd be mincemeat.

55:58.620 --> 56:01.243
- Oh ye of little faith.

56:02.221 --> 56:03.281
Tommy's buying!

56:03.281 --> 56:05.550
(crowd cheering)

56:05.550 --> 56:06.817
- [Tommy] I guess this is mine.

56:06.817 --> 56:07.681
- Yes.

56:07.681 --> 56:08.628
(Carolyn laughing)

56:08.628 --> 56:10.010
- [Tommy] Won't you ever learn, Clifford?

56:10.010 --> 56:13.020
- I've been thinking about a match race.

56:13.020 --> 56:15.942
You still have that land
turtle you call Speedo?

56:15.942 --> 56:18.692
(crowd laughing)

56:20.355 --> 56:23.272
(Blanche clucking)

56:26.557 --> 56:31.557
(water splashing)
(people chattering)

56:38.860 --> 56:39.943
- [Tommy] Hey, Rick.

56:39.943 --> 56:40.776
- Hey.

56:40.776 --> 56:42.040
- [Tommy] Wanna play a little song for me?

56:42.040 --> 56:42.907
- You got it.

56:42.907 --> 56:43.740
- Alrighty.

56:43.740 --> 56:44.773
- Alright, that's a good one.

56:44.773 --> 56:47.690
(gentle country music)

56:47.690 --> 56:49.710
- Hey, young lady,
would you like to dance?

56:49.710 --> 56:51.439
- [Carolyn] Tommy, I would love to.

01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:32.883
Thanks for inviting me.

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.250
- Do you ever get lonely?

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:37.410
- Sure, I do.

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:39.713
That's why we have family and friends.

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.290
- Life can throw us some
curve balls sometimes.

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:49.010
- Maybe that's why God
gives us second chances.

01:00:51.113 --> 01:00:52.030
- Maybe so.

01:01:01.065 --> 01:01:04.315
(gentle country music)

01:01:47.283 --> 01:01:50.533
(lively country music)

01:01:54.248 --> 01:01:55.081
(clapperboard clacking)

01:01:55.081 --> 01:01:56.940
- Tommy is Blanche your chicken?

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.685
Is Blanche your little hottie?

01:01:58.685 --> 01:01:59.969
(all laughing)

01:01:59.969 --> 01:02:00.802
(clapperboard clacking)

01:02:00.802 --> 01:02:03.175
- You're lucky, Luther.

01:02:03.175 --> 01:02:05.104
Shh.

01:02:06.317 --> 01:02:09.067
(gavel thudding)

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.096

01:02:11.096 --> 01:02:12.275
(laughing)

01:02:12.275 --> 01:02:14.370
(clapperboard clacking)

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:15.563
- This is on me.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.500
- Well, I'll take it
outta the tip jar then.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.750
(laughing)

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:25.322
- It's not hard.
(Clifford laughing)

01:02:25.322 --> 01:02:27.156
It's easy.

01:02:27.156 --> 01:02:27.989
(clapperboard clacking)

01:02:27.989 --> 01:02:29.823
- [Tommy] When you want me to pick you up?

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:32.524
- First thing in the morning.

01:02:32.524 --> 01:02:33.937
(both laughing)

01:02:33.937 --> 01:02:34.770
(clapperboard clacking)

01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:36.130
- You're gonna have to
remember that I've got

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:38.070
a holding cell back here.

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.890
It's about 10 feet square.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:41.976
No air conditioning, no furniture.

01:02:41.976 --> 01:02:43.406
