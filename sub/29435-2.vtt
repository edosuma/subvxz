00:18.105 --> 00:20.194
Why does Sahar want me dead?

00:20.237 --> 00:23.284
Because of your burden,
because of your brother Ari.

21:29.113 --> 21:31.246
In the meantime,
do you want to be educated

21:31.290 --> 21:33.596
or do you want
to keep drooling?I don't drool.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.555
Mm, maybe not, but you do have
some egg on your face.

21:35.598 --> 21:38.340
Your report on the
Senate suicide bomb said

21:38.384 --> 21:41.430
this wasn't a dead man's switch,
except it was.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.127
Doesn't look like one.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.390
Because it's not
a spring-trigger,

21:44.433 --> 21:45.478
it's touch-activated.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.350
Wait, so why didn't
the bomb go off

21:48.394 --> 21:49.438
when the bomber dropped it?

21:49.482 --> 21:51.353
Was it a decoy?
Oh, no.

21:51.397 --> 21:54.487
No, these bombs are the
real deal, made of high-end C-4,

21:54.530 --> 21:57.620
but according to the logs
on the detonation processor,

21:57.664 --> 21:59.622
the trigger was disabled
just prior to the attack.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.884
TORRES:
Disabled?

22:00.928 --> 22:02.451
Like, somebody screwed up?

22:02.495 --> 22:04.497
No, this was deliberate.

22:04.540 --> 22:07.238
These bombs
were never gonna go off.

22:07.282 --> 22:08.544
The attack was fake.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.469
So the attacks
were fake?
Yeah.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.602
But why bother
making a real bomb

22:22.645 --> 22:24.168
if you're just gonna disable it?

22:24.212 --> 22:26.214
'Cause needed to look real.But real for what?

22:26.257 --> 22:29.783
Hey, Jack, it's not some Q&A.
I asked you down here for help.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.437
Listen, if you want answers,
you need to find

22:31.480 --> 22:32.960
the people who made those vests,
which means...

22:33.003 --> 22:35.702
Means we need to talk
to Sahar again.
Right.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.878
She should be done
with her arraignment soon.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.575
Hey,

22:39.619 --> 22:42.056
but by "we"
did you mean me,

22:42.099 --> 22:44.450
since you seem to be
avoiding the task?

22:45.538 --> 22:48.845
You're afraid.No, I'm not.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.717
You're afraid
to fail Ziva again.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.719
And if you deny it,

22:52.762 --> 22:54.416
I'm just gonna say it louder.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.592
Got a lead on the vests.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.507
Ah. What do we got?

22:58.551 --> 23:01.989
The bomb detonators are actually
mini programmable computers.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.904
By analyzing
the data caches,

23:03.947 --> 23:05.688
we were able to pull
the IP address

23:05.732 --> 23:06.950
from the PC
that programmed them.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.822
Were you able
to trace it?Kasie was.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.215
The IP address belongs to...

23:12.608 --> 23:15.176
Weird. There's some kind of

23:15.219 --> 23:17.396
RF interference.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.962
Hmm.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.879
Oh, no, please, boss,
don't do that.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.490
BISHOP:
There you go. Okay.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.056
The bomb maker's name

23:26.100 --> 23:28.363
is Dwight Colton,
and he is already on

23:28.407 --> 23:30.060
the FBI watch list for running

23:30.104 --> 23:31.888
an extremist
anti-government militia.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.412
We've traced several
overseas deposits

23:33.455 --> 23:35.196
to Sahar's
bank account,

23:35.239 --> 23:37.067
so Sahar must be
working with him.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.634
Pick him up

23:38.678 --> 23:40.897
before Ziva gets there.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.117
That's a bug.Yeah.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.510
Wait...

23:44.553 --> 23:47.077
Did Ziva bug the bullpen?

23:47.121 --> 23:48.905
Yeah.

23:50.037 --> 23:52.561
TORRES:
I have some movement.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.607
Well, that's not our bomb maker,

23:54.650 --> 23:56.043
but they're
definitely buddies.

23:56.086 --> 23:58.828
Same tattoo.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.177
Well, that makes
three inside.

24:00.221 --> 24:03.746
Actually, four. Heavily armed.
Dwight is with them.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.356
I assume you have a warrant
for his arrest?

24:05.400 --> 24:08.447
We do, and if you had just
stayed with us at NCIS

24:08.490 --> 24:11.058
instead of bugging us,
we could've just told you that.

24:11.101 --> 24:13.495
Just ignore her.
You're paranoid. I get it.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.062
I'm not the only one paranoid.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.630
I do not recommend
entering that building

24:17.673 --> 24:20.328
to serve your warrant.
There will be a standoff.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.373
We don't have time to wait
for them to come out.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.550
You don't have to wait.
Nicholas, you're coming with me.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.116
Eleanor, you're staying
in the car.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.118
You'll know what to do.
Come on. Follow me.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.946
You're the one who said,

24:29.990 --> 24:32.166
"When Ziva asks you
to do something..."

24:35.125 --> 24:37.084
All right,
what's the play?

24:37.127 --> 24:38.912
I'm gonna hit you.
You're gonna hit me back.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.522
They're gonna come out
and watch the fight.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.046
Just, please, make it look real.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.092
Okay, I'm not
gonna hit you.

24:45.135 --> 24:47.094
Come on, you're not
gonna hurt me.

24:47.137 --> 24:50.663
O-Okay, I know you're supposed
to be this major badass,

24:50.706 --> 24:53.796
but this guy is not
gonna hit you.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.015
[grunts]

24:56.582 --> 24:59.236
Hit me.I'm not gonna hit you.

25:00.237 --> 25:01.935
Okay, stop that.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.284
[both grunt][coughing]

25:03.327 --> 25:06.200
Okay.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.028
All right.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.944
Game on, mujer.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.084
Is that all you got?
[laughs]

25:36.360 --> 25:38.928
[chuckling]

25:38.972 --> 25:41.496
Don't be a wuss.
Tell her how you feel.What?

25:41.540 --> 25:44.630
Freeze. NCIS.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.980
Hands up!

25:48.895 --> 25:50.897
Thoughtful design.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.032
Your men are dead.

25:56.076 --> 25:58.295
Martyrs for the cause.

25:58.339 --> 26:00.123
Yeah? What cause is that?

26:00.167 --> 26:02.212
I don't recognize your authority
to ask me questions.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.084
But you do recognize hers.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.912
Right?

26:08.958 --> 26:10.177
You're working with her, right?

26:12.048 --> 26:13.006
We know she planned
the attack.

26:13.049 --> 26:14.311
Her kind
is gonna burn,

26:14.355 --> 26:16.313
just like the rest of you
government thugs.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.011
But for now,

26:18.054 --> 26:20.404
the enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.189
Well, your friend
played your ass.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.583
Those vests you made,

26:24.626 --> 26:28.195
she had them disabled
prior to the attack.

26:28.238 --> 26:30.937
[chuckles] Did she now?Yeah.

26:30.980 --> 26:34.070
The-the dead man's switches
were reprogrammed.

26:34.114 --> 26:37.552
Your bombs were
never gonna explode.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.207
[laughs]

26:40.250 --> 26:43.036
Man, she used you.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.954
Who helped you

26:47.997 --> 26:51.087
get those vests
through security?

26:51.131 --> 26:53.481
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.744
I want a name.They were working

26:55.788 --> 26:58.094
perfectly when I gave 'em
to that stupid cop.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.663
But the revolution
is still coming.

27:01.707 --> 27:04.579
And the true patriot understands
that the real enemy isn't

27:04.623 --> 27:07.060
plastic straws.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.670
It's an oppressive,
fascist government

27:08.714 --> 27:10.193
that cares more
about clean air

27:10.237 --> 27:11.281
than freedom.

27:11.325 --> 27:12.631
You mean like this guy?

27:14.371 --> 27:15.851
[knocking on door]

27:15.895 --> 27:18.288
McGEE:
Chief Freydano, NCIS.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.247
Open up.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.771
He's not here.You were supposed to wait

27:22.815 --> 27:24.599
for my signal
before you went in.You took too long.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.166
House is empty.
Suitcase is missing.

27:26.209 --> 27:29.299
[sighs] He must've figured out
we connected him to Sahar.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.260
Perhaps we can
find something

27:33.303 --> 27:36.002
that'll tell us
where he's going.

27:36.045 --> 27:38.178
I miss doing this
with you, Ziva.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.006
Though what I really miss
is that I didn't get to see

27:40.049 --> 27:41.311
you and Torres fight.[chuckles]

27:41.355 --> 27:44.053
What I wouldn't give
to see him get his a...

27:45.446 --> 27:46.621
McGee.
Hey, boss.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.971
Freydano was
already gone.

27:49.015 --> 27:50.407
Thought you were headed down
to Capitol Police.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.148
Uh, no, Bishop's on that.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.889
She tell you about
the bank transfer we found?

27:53.933 --> 27:55.369
Turns out
that Freydano,

27:55.412 --> 27:56.762
he's a gun for hire...

27:56.805 --> 27:58.285
Hey, Tim?
Yeah.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.243
Go check out the house, okay?

28:00.287 --> 28:03.246
Okay. Check the house.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.991
Left something.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.645
Do you think
you would've found that

28:10.689 --> 28:12.212
if I didn't want you to?I don't know.

28:12.255 --> 28:14.040
I miss things sometimes.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.217
So I hear.

28:17.260 --> 28:21.177
Ha. I see you've been
talking to Ducky.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.570
Ziva,

28:22.613 --> 28:24.703
I didn't come looking
for you because you died.

28:27.401 --> 28:28.968
Did they ever find a body?

28:29.925 --> 28:31.579
You asked me where
I got this scar.

28:31.622 --> 28:32.667
I got it in Paraguay.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.103
The second I heard
you and McGee

28:34.147 --> 28:35.496
had been kidnapped,
I flew down

28:35.539 --> 28:37.193
to South America.
My contacts said you were dead.

28:37.237 --> 28:38.934
But still,
I spent months

28:38.978 --> 28:42.155
turning over every rock in
every hellhole looking for you.

28:42.198 --> 28:44.592
The rescue helicopter
only beat me by an hour.

28:44.635 --> 28:47.290
And after they pulled you out,
did it never occur to you

28:47.334 --> 28:50.511
to wonder why no one
came looking for revenge?

28:50.554 --> 28:54.515
I got this scar
making sure no one could.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.604
That is what you do
for the people you love.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.650
That is what you do for your
family. What did you do for me?

28:59.694 --> 29:00.739
Nothing!

29:00.782 --> 29:02.653
You couldn't even hope

29:02.697 --> 29:04.655
I was still alive.

29:12.663 --> 29:16.667
Sorry, boss, I was, uh, waiting
for a pause in the conversation.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.582
Okay.Found something
in the house.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.541
You know,

29:20.584 --> 29:22.412
I'm thinking I shouldn't have
left you two alone.

29:22.456 --> 29:25.981
What'd you find?Freydano had a burn phone.

29:26.025 --> 29:29.680
Maybe it'll help us find out
where he's running to.

29:29.724 --> 29:33.336
Did I hear someone
mention Paraguay?

29:33.380 --> 29:34.642
DUCKY:
You rang?

29:34.685 --> 29:36.644
Ah, you are just the Duckster
I wanted to see.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.515
I found something
on that cop's phone

29:38.559 --> 29:39.908
that I wanted
to run by you.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.475
Oh, of course.

29:41.518 --> 29:44.304
Was it useful in finding
Chief Freydano's whereabouts?

29:44.347 --> 29:47.350
Uh, not yet, but I did manage
to partially reconstruct

29:47.394 --> 29:50.005
a video chat between
him and Sahar.

29:50.049 --> 29:52.355
So they are
working together.Yeah.

29:52.399 --> 29:54.749
And, naturally,
you'd like my opinion

29:54.793 --> 29:58.274
as to why a decorated
police officer would...

29:58.318 --> 29:59.885
We already know.
Money.

29:59.928 --> 30:02.148
Oh.
And we were right.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.541
According to their texts,
the suicide attacks

30:04.585 --> 30:06.500
were just a distraction.

30:06.543 --> 30:07.849
And you would like me
to determine

30:07.893 --> 30:09.590
why Sahar needed
a distraction?

30:09.633 --> 30:10.765
Oh, I already
know that, too.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.506
Apparently, the entire point

30:12.549 --> 30:14.116
was to trick the Capitol Police

30:14.160 --> 30:17.163
into activating something called
the Iron Citadel protocol,

30:17.206 --> 30:18.729
whatever that is.

30:18.773 --> 30:21.776
Oh, it's an obscure provision
of the Patriot Act.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.778
But what has
all this to do

30:23.822 --> 30:26.650
with Sahar's vendetta
against Ziva?

30:26.694 --> 30:30.306
Oh, that's why you
invited me down here.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.874
You want me to postulate
theories as to...

30:32.918 --> 30:34.528
Sorry, no.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.573
May I have a lifeline?

30:36.617 --> 30:39.533
I called you down here
because I also traced

30:39.576 --> 30:44.581
several phone calls
between Chief Freydano and you.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.064
Me?

30:49.108 --> 30:50.544
Which makes it seem like

30:50.587 --> 30:53.286
you're secretly working
with Sahar.

30:53.329 --> 30:55.549
[chuckles]: But that
obviously can't be true.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.943
Right?Well, of course not.

30:57.986 --> 31:00.684
I mean, I don't even have
my phone. I lent it to Z...

31:00.728 --> 31:02.730
Oh. Yeah, see,

31:02.773 --> 31:06.386
it looked like your lips were
just about to make a "Z" sound.

31:06.429 --> 31:07.909
[grunts softly]As in, you know...

31:07.953 --> 31:10.825
The last time I saw her,
Ziva asked to borrow it.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.046
Oh, well, she just got
a lot more interesting.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.439
Well, this cannot be
what it looks like.

31:16.483 --> 31:17.963
Good. Because what it looks like

31:18.006 --> 31:20.530
is that Ziva
is secretly working with Sahar.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.837
The terrorist lady.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.848
Ziva's not answering her phone.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.154
Ping it.BISHOP:
I'm trying,

31:35.197 --> 31:37.069
but she must have
disabled the battery.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.635
When was the last time
you saw her?

31:38.679 --> 31:39.985
At Chief Freydano's house.

31:40.028 --> 31:42.030
Ziva knew his burn phone
would lead us back to her.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.771
That's why she split.BISHOP:
No.

31:43.814 --> 31:46.208
This cannot be what it looks
like. Ziva is not helping Sahar.

31:46.252 --> 31:48.254
Gibbs, canthis be
what it looks like?

31:48.297 --> 31:51.648
Either way, we played
right into Sahar's hands.

31:51.692 --> 31:54.042
She wanted us to invoke
the IC protocol.

31:54.086 --> 31:56.653
Why?I can't even begin to imagine
what she would gain by it.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.481
If anything,
the authority that it grants us

31:58.525 --> 32:00.135
makes it easier
to round her people up.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.137
And we're gonna
need that authority.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.443
Sahar's escaped.

32:03.486 --> 32:05.488
What? How?She was on her way

32:05.532 --> 32:07.142
to a federal holding facility.

32:07.186 --> 32:08.230
Someone rammed her transport.

32:08.274 --> 32:09.492
TORRES:
"Someone," huh?

32:09.536 --> 32:11.146
Sounds like a "Z" coming.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.234
Sahar wants Ziva dead. Remember?

32:12.278 --> 32:14.062
So, it could easily have been

32:14.106 --> 32:15.324
Chief Freydano
that busted her out.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.979
Nope, couldn't be,
'cause Freydano

32:18.023 --> 32:20.895
was picked up by airport police
trying to leave the country.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.071
Which brings us back to Z...We're not going there.

32:23.115 --> 32:25.117
Uh...No, no. No. Leon, not yet.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.075
Him.

32:27.119 --> 32:29.773
Him. Bring him in.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.906
I want a deal.I don't care what you want.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.255
You have no idea
what's happening.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.127
We know you and Sahar
are working together.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.780
What's that called, again?Treason.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.521
Treason. You're gonna hang.

32:38.565 --> 32:39.609
GIBBS:
You want a deal?

32:39.653 --> 32:41.916
You get to live. That's it.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.178
Talk.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.050
TORRES:
Why is Sahar
so interested

32:45.093 --> 32:47.182
in that Iron Citadel thing?

32:47.226 --> 32:48.792
What's this got to do
with Ziva David?

32:50.751 --> 32:52.622
You have it all wrong.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.755
Sahar doesn't
want Ziva dead.

32:54.798 --> 32:58.150
Ziva's helping Sahar
rebuild her organization.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.630
Bull.
I didn't say
willingly.

33:00.674 --> 33:03.807
In fact, Sahar's original plan
was to kidnap you

33:03.851 --> 33:05.896
and force Ziva
to help her.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.029
Keep talking.

33:09.074 --> 33:11.076
But Ziva was able to warn you,

33:11.119 --> 33:15.297
so Sahar had
to improvise a plan B.

33:15.341 --> 33:17.517
She made an offer to Ziva

33:17.560 --> 33:19.736
when they were alone together
in the police station.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.738
You owe these people nothing.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.262
They abandoned you.

33:23.305 --> 33:24.741
I owe you even less.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.743
But if you help us,

33:26.787 --> 33:28.963
you can have your life back.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.096
This was
never about you.

33:31.139 --> 33:33.750
All we want is liberty
for our people.

33:33.794 --> 33:36.188
And no one else needs to die.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.059
It wasn't even that hard a sell.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.888
When Ziva got back to D.C.,
she contacted me.

33:40.931 --> 33:43.195
I arranged for a special drive

33:43.238 --> 33:45.849
to be delivered to her
with a list of accounts.

33:45.893 --> 33:48.069
Once she was inside NCIS,

33:48.113 --> 33:51.290
which only Ziva David could do,

33:51.333 --> 33:54.293
she gained access
to your director's office...

33:57.252 --> 33:59.080
...and used
the emergency powers

33:59.124 --> 34:01.735
granted to your agency
to access over $50 million

34:01.778 --> 34:05.217
in frozen assets
belonging to Sahar's group.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.136
The group that fell apart
after Ari was killed.

34:12.267 --> 34:14.139
Sahar's trying to rebuild it.

34:14.182 --> 34:16.315
What better way to show
her worth to her people

34:16.358 --> 34:20.841
than to use the very person
that took it down?

34:24.845 --> 34:26.934
You check cameras?

34:26.977 --> 34:29.371
Disabled. And it looks like
Sahar's assets

34:29.415 --> 34:31.852
were transferred to over
a dozen overseas banks.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.462
Where?Routing numbers
are masked.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.769
But boss, this doesn't mean
that we know that Ziva...

34:35.812 --> 34:38.119
Got a match.Her prints are
all over the room.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.729
VANCE:
Well, that settles that.

34:39.773 --> 34:40.948
Gibbs, this isn't Ziva's fault.

34:40.991 --> 34:42.167
I mean, if she thought
this was the only way

34:42.210 --> 34:43.994
to get her life back,
to see her daughter?

34:44.038 --> 34:45.822
She'd do anything.
TORRES:
The question is,

34:45.866 --> 34:46.823
what is she doing now?

34:46.867 --> 34:48.651
McGee, get Treasury over here.

34:48.695 --> 34:49.652
On it.
Torres,

34:49.696 --> 34:50.914
airport checkpoints.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.307
On it.
Bishop,

34:52.351 --> 34:54.788
BOLO on Ziva.

34:54.831 --> 34:55.919
To be arrested on sight.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.747
You may not need that BOLO.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.662
Ducky's cell just
came back on line.

34:59.706 --> 35:00.794
I think Ziva made a call.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.317
And I got a location.

35:06.016 --> 35:07.757
Wow, I'm starting to think
we need to up our security

35:07.801 --> 35:09.846
around here.I'm starting to think

35:09.890 --> 35:11.413
I shouldn't have
had that Big Gulp.

35:11.457 --> 35:12.980
It will not be
for much longer, gentlemen.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.199
ANDREWS:
Ma'am,

35:14.242 --> 35:16.026
this is a felony.

35:16.070 --> 35:19.726
Now, it's not too late to put
the toothpaste back in the tube.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.946
This is for your protection.
Enough people have been hurt.

35:22.990 --> 35:23.991
[door opens]

35:25.210 --> 35:26.863
Uh...
[shushes]

35:30.650 --> 35:32.173
Is it done?

35:32.217 --> 35:33.174
I transferred your assets.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.524
All bank information is here.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.874
Verify it, then upload the data.

35:37.918 --> 35:40.181
I did what you asked of me.
I freed your money.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.009
Now I want your word
it ends here.

35:42.052 --> 35:46.361
Yes, I did give you my word.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.929
It's not really
an even trade, is it?

35:48.972 --> 35:51.192
It took over a
decade to climb out

35:51.236 --> 35:53.934
from the rubble you made
of all of our lives.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.850
We were tortured
for years

35:56.893 --> 35:57.981
in that POW camp.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.418
We barely survived.

36:04.945 --> 36:06.555
But you did stick

36:06.599 --> 36:08.122
to your end of the bargain.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.037
And I would like
to uphold mine.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.300
Unfortunately,
it's not up to me.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.912
I'm sorry. Kill her.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.828
NCIS. Freeze.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.439
Nobody move.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.092
You're under arrest.

36:23.746 --> 36:24.965
You're all under arrest.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.885
You're too late.

36:31.928 --> 36:33.756
Am I?

36:33.800 --> 36:38.326
Actually, you're right on time.

36:39.719 --> 36:41.851
I transferred your assets, yes.

36:41.895 --> 36:43.810
But I also alerted Interpol.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.073
So, when your people go
to retrieve their money,

36:46.116 --> 36:48.380
they'll be arrested.

36:49.424 --> 36:50.904
Ziva.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.949
It's over.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.998
Seems that it is.

36:58.041 --> 37:01.871
And that I underestimated
you all. Or did I?

37:01.915 --> 37:05.266
Tell me. When I made the
offer to you back there,

37:05.310 --> 37:07.877
were you playing me
from the beginning?

37:07.921 --> 37:10.010
Or did you actually consider it?

37:10.053 --> 37:12.882
I don't kiss and show.

37:12.926 --> 37:14.449
[whispers]:
"Tell."

37:14.493 --> 37:17.278
Either way, so much for plan B.SAHAR:
Yes.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.846
But I will not be going back
to prison.

37:19.889 --> 37:22.631
Time for plan C.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.134
How'd you know?

37:48.178 --> 37:50.964
I didn't.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.270
Hoped.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.713
And you're not that sloppy.

38:00.756 --> 38:05.065
Tracked you when you turned
Ducky's GPS back on.

38:07.023 --> 38:09.374
[insects trilling]

38:25.085 --> 38:26.652
You're gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

38:29.045 --> 38:33.006
I heard Interpol arrested the
last of Sahar's splinter group.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.661
Her organization is destroyed.
That's good.

38:35.704 --> 38:37.837
You lied to me.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.801
I know. And for that, I'm sorry.

38:45.845 --> 38:47.368
But it was the only way
my plan would work.

38:47.412 --> 38:48.630
Do you really think
Vance would have

38:48.674 --> 38:50.066
allowed me
to transfer the assets?

38:50.110 --> 38:52.242
But I'm not, I'm not Vance.I know.

38:54.027 --> 38:56.029
I'm sorry,
but I have to get going.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.509
I didn't go looking for you
after you blew up...

38:57.552 --> 39:01.077
[sighs] Gibbs....because I had
lost you once before.

39:01.121 --> 39:05.386
And I get it in my head
that you're alive

39:05.430 --> 39:08.084
and I'm out there
looking and it turns out

39:08.128 --> 39:11.000
you're not...

39:11.044 --> 39:13.786
I would've, uh...

39:18.225 --> 39:20.227
I would've...

39:25.450 --> 39:30.977
I would have lost you a thousand
times, if that's what it took.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.330
I waited for you, Gibbs.

39:37.810 --> 39:41.596
I waited and I waited
and I waited.

39:45.165 --> 39:48.124
And you never came.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.519
I made a mistake.

39:52.564 --> 39:55.131
[sighs]

39:55.175 --> 39:58.308
Where to now, Ziva?

40:04.227 --> 40:06.621
There's one more thing
I have to do

40:06.665 --> 40:08.841
before I can
put this all behind me.

40:08.884 --> 40:12.018
And this time,

40:12.061 --> 40:14.368
I have to do it alone.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.421
[phone ringing]

40:28.774 --> 40:30.253
I called him after
you went missing,

40:30.297 --> 40:32.386
and I left a message.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.563
What did you say?Nothing.

40:35.607 --> 40:37.783
He should hear it from you.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.090
And he will.

40:44.354 --> 40:46.356
