00:10.053 --> 00:11.924
[gunfire]

00:11.968 --> 00:13.143
GIBBS:
I want to know

00:13.187 --> 00:14.710
who we're running from!There is a woman.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.190
Her name is Sahar.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.061
She wants me dead,
and now she's after you, too.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.194
Why does Sahar want me dead?

00:20.237 --> 00:23.284
Because of your burden,
because of your brother Ari.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.242
And for what you've done.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.070
As long as she is alive,
she is a threat,

00:27.114 --> 00:28.811
and I will not have this threat
follow me

00:28.854 --> 00:30.900
back to my family.You do not want
to go down this road.

00:30.943 --> 00:35.035
The only way back to Tali,
back home, is if Sahar is dead.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.471
SAHAR:
If you kill me, Miss David,

00:36.514 --> 00:39.300
a United States senator
will be dead by morning.

00:39.343 --> 00:40.649
That is tomorrow's
concern.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.738
This is today.Ziva!

00:49.266 --> 00:51.094
MAN:
Mm.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.878
MAN 2:
Well, one of us
should stay awake.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.706
I nominate you.

00:54.750 --> 00:58.449
It's your turn.Oh, I was awake yesterday.

00:58.493 --> 01:00.451
Oh, I have apnea.
I need to rest.Yeah?

01:00.495 --> 01:02.279
Well, I have
bored-out-of-my-mind,

01:02.323 --> 01:04.238
so until we see
some action...[door opening]

01:04.281 --> 01:06.936
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.
Where's your holding cell?

01:06.979 --> 01:09.243
Oh, may I ask
what this is about?Get out of the way!

01:09.286 --> 01:10.244
Well, it's not a holding cell,
per se.

01:10.287 --> 01:11.593
It's just... we just have this.

01:11.636 --> 01:14.770
But, like, ain't nobody's
escaped yet.

01:14.813 --> 01:16.772
She's bluffing.Am I?

01:16.815 --> 01:18.643
I say we put a bullet
in your head and find out.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.993
What if she's not bluffing?We try to avoid shooting people.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.126
She's too dangerous
to keep alive, Gibbs!

01:23.170 --> 01:24.258
Go ahead, do it!

01:24.301 --> 01:25.955
Oh, don't push me!We're not

01:25.998 --> 01:27.435
doing this again!

01:27.478 --> 01:28.523
You want to shoot her?

01:28.566 --> 01:31.003
Go ahead, shoot her!

01:31.047 --> 01:33.005
I don't care.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.531
â™ª

02:04.907 --> 02:07.649
Have we learned
which senator's the target?Not yet.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.303
Of course, that's assuming
the threat's even real.

02:09.346 --> 02:10.782
Agent Gibbs
believes it is.

02:10.826 --> 02:13.089
Problem is, we get a dozen calls
like this every week.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.352
Get me actionable data,
we'll go to the mattresses.

02:15.396 --> 02:18.007
But we can't run scared
every time somebody says "boo."

02:18.050 --> 02:19.487
That's exactly what they want.

02:19.530 --> 02:20.749
Understood.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.794
Sitrep.

02:22.838 --> 02:25.145
Got Gibbs again. Says
Sahar's still playing games.

02:25.188 --> 02:26.755
And Ziva's still trying
to shoot her.

02:26.798 --> 02:29.192
Gibbs. Talk to me.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.368
Does Sahar have more people
out there or not?

02:31.412 --> 02:32.369
Uh, working on it.

02:32.413 --> 02:33.501
What can we do?

02:33.544 --> 02:35.329
Talk to Bishop's contact at NSA.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.983
Right. The POW camp
where Sahar was held.

02:38.027 --> 02:39.289
Find out
if she made any friends.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.639
On it.On it.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.033
Hold up.

02:44.076 --> 02:47.428
Now that Gibbs mentions it,
where is Agent Bishop?

02:47.471 --> 02:49.430
Haven't seen her.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.388
I thought she was
in here.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.782
You aren't lying again, are you?McGEE: No.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.175
No, sir.
I hope not,

02:55.218 --> 02:56.959
because the three of you
still aren't off the hook

02:57.002 --> 02:58.221
for the last time.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.483
Yes, sir.

02:59.527 --> 03:00.658
All right.

03:01.964 --> 03:03.748
[quietly]: Please tell me
we didn't just lie

03:03.792 --> 03:05.533
to the director again.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.883
BISHOP: Hi. This is Ellie.
You know the deal.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.798
[voice mail beeps]

03:09.841 --> 03:11.713
So, uh...

03:11.756 --> 03:14.237
it like this all the time
where you work?

03:14.281 --> 03:15.717
Anything we can do
to help?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.458
It's been awful
quiet in there.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.068
You want us to take
a crack at it?

03:24.291 --> 03:26.031
How can I have my life back?!

03:26.075 --> 03:27.424
You said you wanted me dead!

03:27.468 --> 03:29.644
Looks like that won't be
happening now.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.298
Which senator?

03:31.341 --> 03:34.126
I'd hate to ruin the surprise.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.127
Oh, be careful.

03:35.171 --> 03:37.173
You aren't going to hurt me.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.696
You need me.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.699
What's that supposed to mean?Relationships are hard.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.310
Life is hard.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.963
But when you
were on the run,

03:45.007 --> 03:46.922
you got to avoid all of that.

03:46.965 --> 03:49.316
You don't know anything
about me.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.708
I amyou, Ziva.

03:50.752 --> 03:53.494
We both lost the best years
of our lives in prison.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.060
The only difference is

03:55.104 --> 03:57.367
Ihad no choice.
But you...

03:57.411 --> 03:59.500
You finish that sentence
and you die.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.110
You made your prison.

04:01.153 --> 04:04.592
Ziva...You chose to hide from
the ones you love.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.551
SAHAR:
No!

04:09.510 --> 04:10.772
[exhales]

04:10.815 --> 04:13.296
And you think
I'mthe one bluffing?

04:13.340 --> 04:14.863
Get out of here.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.398
I come at a bad time?

04:36.667 --> 04:38.669
[insects trilling]

04:40.497 --> 04:42.934
I definitely think
I came at a bad time.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.285
My life is a series
of bad times.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.156
That's why I'm here.
I thought I could help.

04:47.199 --> 04:50.768
To be honest, I'm not sure
what I need right now.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.162
Okay.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.250
If we're being honest,

04:54.294 --> 04:56.383
I'm really here because
I thought this

04:56.426 --> 04:58.385
might be my only chance
to meet you.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.084
And you have questions?

05:02.127 --> 05:03.303
I have a lot of questions.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.267
Bishop.
Let's move!

05:11.311 --> 05:13.617
Hey, Gibbs. I, um...Yeah, yeah.

05:13.661 --> 05:16.054
I can guess.
Come on.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.273
Our ride is here.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.493
He did not know
you were coming.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.669
No.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.630
Well, I found Bishop.

05:26.674 --> 05:29.198
Yeah, we heard. She's
choppering back with Gibbs.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.460
Guess the mystique of

05:30.504 --> 05:32.810
Ziva David
was too much to resist.

05:32.854 --> 05:35.247
Is this Sahar's
old prison camp?
TORRES: Yeah.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.859
Any leads on who else
she may be working with?TORRES: No.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.600
But now we know why
she's really pissed.

05:39.643 --> 05:42.472
We originally assumed
that Sahar was Hamas.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.213
But we spoke
with a former guard,

05:44.256 --> 05:46.868
and it turns out that she was
leading a splinter group.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.870
A woman,
in that part of the world?

05:48.913 --> 05:51.307
She actually got pretty close to
taking over the whole enchilada.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.614
Let me guess, glass ceiling.McGEE:
We don't know.

05:53.657 --> 05:56.051
But things went sideways,
and the group fell apart.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.967
And then Treasury
froze the assets.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.622
And Sahar ended up
in a POW camp.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.145
TORRES: Very pissed
in a POW camp.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.929
What we're not really sure about

06:04.973 --> 06:06.322
is why she wants to take it out
on a senator.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.497
SLOANE:
Mm-mm. No.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.629
You're not asking
the right question.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.326
We need to find out

06:10.370 --> 06:13.198
why Sahar was after Gibbs
to begin with.

06:13.242 --> 06:14.591
Answer that question

06:14.635 --> 06:16.550
and, uh, you'll figure out
what she's up to.

06:16.593 --> 06:17.768
McGEE:
Well, we've been trying

06:17.812 --> 06:20.292
to figure that out
for two days already.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.382
Well, we know one thing:

06:22.425 --> 06:23.861
she wasn't bluffing.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.995
NEWS ANNOUNCER:
This is ZNN with breaking news.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.300
Washington is on high alert

06:28.344 --> 06:30.085
after an attempted
suicide bomber

06:30.128 --> 06:32.261
was killed by Capitol police
this evening at a hotel

06:32.304 --> 06:34.045
outside Georgetown.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.700
Over 30 senators were
in attendance at the gathering.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.270
OFFICER [over radio]:
Bomb secure. All clear.

06:41.313 --> 06:44.447
Repeat, all clear.
Okay, boys, do your thing.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.188
I was double-checking
our security arrangements

06:46.231 --> 06:47.450
when I noticed the waiter
was acting strange,

06:47.494 --> 06:48.973
so I shadowed him.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.801
Second I saw him go for
the trigger, I took the shot.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.673
TORRES:
You're lucky it wasn't
a dead man's switch.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.979
FREYDANO:
I was out of options
at that point.

06:55.023 --> 06:57.242
Just the one?FREYDANO: One's enough.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.462
And I owe your director
an apology.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.769
McGEE:
Did the attacker
seem focused on any

07:01.812 --> 07:04.467
particular senator?Not that I could tell.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.208
Was he after anyone specific?

07:06.251 --> 07:09.124
Well, the size of the bomb
suggests a single target.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.169
Well, we, we may not
agree on much, but...

07:11.213 --> 07:13.258
there is one thing...

07:13.302 --> 07:15.130
SENATOR ORTEGA:
An attack against one of us

07:15.173 --> 07:16.653
is an attack against all of us.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.350
Mm-hmm.

07:19.743 --> 07:22.006
BISHOP:
How'd the bomber
get that past security?

07:22.050 --> 07:23.355
Should've
been impossible.

07:23.399 --> 07:24.966
Until we know
who the target is...

07:25.009 --> 07:26.141
Every senator that was here

07:26.184 --> 07:27.316
needs to get into
witness protection.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.536
We need to get this Sahar
to talk.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.363
Fast.

07:31.407 --> 07:32.930
[whispers]: Torres.Mm?

07:32.974 --> 07:35.280
[whispers]: Bishop.Mm?

07:37.979 --> 07:40.155
McGEE: So, where's Ziva?I don't know.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.592
She took off
as soon as we landed.What the hell were you thinking?

07:42.636 --> 07:44.551
What, do we have
to put a bell on you?What? No--

07:44.594 --> 07:46.291
I thought Gibbs
could use the backup.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.555
[exhaling]: Did
she say anything?

07:48.598 --> 07:50.992
About what?About anything.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.342
She thanked me for
rescuing Morgan Burke.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.257
Did she say
anything else?

07:55.300 --> 07:57.346
Look, McGee, you need
to prepare yourself.

07:57.389 --> 08:00.262
I don't think she's the same
person that you remember.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.196
[gunshot][grunts]

08:26.723 --> 08:28.725
[inhales]

08:29.639 --> 08:31.467
[exhales]

08:41.172 --> 08:42.739
[exhales, sniffles]

08:49.006 --> 08:51.661
Identify yourself or I shoot.

08:51.705 --> 08:55.273
DUCKY:
Dr. Donald Mallard.

08:55.317 --> 08:56.666
Is that sufficient

08:56.710 --> 08:58.450
not to be shot?

08:58.494 --> 09:01.105
Ducky.When I heard that

09:01.149 --> 09:03.325
Gibbs didn't take you
to the crime scene,

09:03.368 --> 09:07.459
I figured I might
find you here.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.984
He said he would
meet me here after.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.552
He didn't.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.945
How long have you
been waiting?

09:14.989 --> 09:16.991
Four hours.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.951
Good to see you.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.301
You, too.

09:27.610 --> 09:30.831
Though, clearly,

09:30.874 --> 09:34.791
things are not so good.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.401
Do they help?

09:36.445 --> 09:38.186
Sometimes, yeah.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.666
It's hard to imagine

09:39.709 --> 09:43.278
what you must've been
going through these last years.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.062
And alone.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.499
I was not alone.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.806
I had my daughter.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.418
DUCKY:
I... I don't see...

09:53.462 --> 09:55.029
She's in the background.
That's, uh,

09:55.072 --> 09:56.508
as close as I dared to get.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.423
I think this was
ice cream day.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.034
[both chuckle]

10:00.077 --> 10:01.470
I like to think that

10:01.513 --> 10:04.691
she was quite
excited that day.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.867
Does Tony know?

10:09.696 --> 10:11.567
It's complicated.

10:14.744 --> 10:17.094
The less Tony knows,
the better.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.663
The less you allknow,
the better.

10:20.707 --> 10:25.233
I have known you
for a very long time,

10:25.276 --> 10:26.669
Ziva David.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.062
It is hard
to think of you

10:28.105 --> 10:29.454
going on that journey

10:29.498 --> 10:31.979
without knowing that Gibbs
had your back.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.330
[scoffs]

10:35.373 --> 10:37.549
He thought you were dead.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.116
We all did.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.640
He should've
known better, Ducky.

10:40.683 --> 10:43.555
I left him a trail
that only he could see.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.689
But he didn't come looking.

10:46.733 --> 10:51.041
And now you believe
that none of this will end

10:51.085 --> 10:53.391
until you have killed

10:53.435 --> 10:56.307
the person who is after you.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.135
And make no mistake,
I will do whatever it takes

10:58.179 --> 10:59.397
to get back to my daughter.

10:59.441 --> 11:00.703
Whatever it takes.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.750
And nobody,
nobody's gonna stand in my way.

11:03.793 --> 11:06.056
[sighs]

11:06.100 --> 11:07.623
[door opens]

11:07.667 --> 11:09.190
[door closes]

11:09.233 --> 11:11.061
Did you find out
who the target is yet?

11:11.105 --> 11:12.410
Waiting for you.

11:12.454 --> 11:13.629
Since when do you need
an audience?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.979
You're not the audience,
Jack, I am.

11:16.023 --> 11:18.068
Really? I-I thought
you would want to...

11:18.112 --> 11:20.070
Wasting time.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.686
[door opens, closes]

11:27.774 --> 11:30.428
So... [clears throat]

11:30.472 --> 11:33.431
You are Mira Sahar Azam.

11:34.650 --> 11:35.869
You sound disappointed.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.522
To be honest,
you don't really strike me

11:37.566 --> 11:40.395
as the leader
of a terrorist splinter group.

11:40.438 --> 11:43.006
I'm a work in progress.Right.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.313
Must be hard living
in a man's world.

11:45.356 --> 11:48.055
I bet you kill twice
as many heretics

11:48.098 --> 11:50.231
for only half the martyrdom.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.276
Am I right, girlfriend?

11:52.320 --> 11:54.626
Is this an interrogation
or an audition for The View?

11:54.670 --> 11:56.628
Why were you after Gibbs?Pass.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.892
What do you want
with Ziva David?Yawn.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.110
Who's your target?

12:00.154 --> 12:01.590
Target?

12:01.633 --> 12:03.592
Which senator are you after?

12:03.635 --> 12:05.550
Senator?

12:05.594 --> 12:07.204
Did I say senator?

12:07.248 --> 12:09.119
Now that I think
about it,

12:09.163 --> 12:13.123
I may have meant congressman.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.603
Girlfriend.

12:18.650 --> 12:19.739
Get me Capitol Police.

12:19.782 --> 12:20.870
Already got 'em.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.611
There's been another attack.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.266
Sahar's playing
us, isn't she?

12:32.534 --> 12:34.884
D.C. was thrown
into chaos today

12:34.928 --> 12:37.626
when a second suicide bomber
in as many days

12:37.669 --> 12:39.671
was killed by Capitol Police.

12:39.715 --> 12:42.109
William Calbert is standing by
with his report.[sound off]

12:42.152 --> 12:45.765
It was a commemoration
for a retiring congresswoman.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.767
Thankfully, nobody was hurt.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.072
Not gonna last.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.118
All 538 members of Congress

12:51.161 --> 12:52.815
have been placed
in protective custody.

12:54.382 --> 12:55.339
But Capitol Police
have been

12:55.383 --> 12:56.906
pushed to the breaking point.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.647
You gotta get Sahar to talk.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.041
All she's doing
right now is smirking.And Ziva?

13:01.084 --> 13:02.999
She's checking with some
of her brother's old contacts.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.348
See if they heard anything.

13:04.392 --> 13:05.436
Not what I was asking.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.961
Where is her head at?

13:08.004 --> 13:09.397
I had a chat
with Dr. Mallard.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.355
Didn't exactly fill me
with rainbows.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.793
Huh.

13:15.272 --> 13:16.752
Um, I-I can...

13:16.796 --> 13:18.798
Leave.I can leave.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.761
Ziva.She's gonna be okay, Leon.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.936
And you?

13:26.980 --> 13:29.373
What's that supposed to mean?

13:29.417 --> 13:31.201
I had a chat with Sloane, too.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.856
It's not like you to punt
on an interrogation.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.989
I didn't punt.
I don't punt.

13:36.032 --> 13:37.207
Hmm.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.644
Gibbs, Capitol Police
has activated

13:39.688 --> 13:41.995
the Patriot Act's
"Iron Citadel" provision.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.258
It grants my office
additional powers.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.260
So whatever you need,
you got it.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.915
But I need to make sure
that your head is in the game.What you need, Leon,

13:48.958 --> 13:51.831
is for me to find out where
those bombers are coming from.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.882
You got a second body.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.057
Yeah, he just arrived.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.145
Talk to me.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.146
Gibbs, wait, so you're...

14:03.190 --> 14:04.452
you're alone, then, or...?

14:04.495 --> 14:06.019
That a problem?
Yeah.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.020
I mean-- I mean no, no.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.891
I just, uh, I was hoping

14:08.935 --> 14:09.936
that Ziva would be with you.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.546
I have a ton of questions
for her,

14:11.589 --> 14:13.591
starting with what the heck
am I supposed to say to Tony

14:13.635 --> 14:15.811
when he calls me for our
monthly Fortnite session?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.378
Yeah, well, I'm hoping
for something, too, Palmer.

14:17.421 --> 14:18.945
What?

14:18.988 --> 14:21.773
Oh, oh, right, yes.
The "talk to me."

14:21.817 --> 14:22.862
Uh, this is our

14:22.905 --> 14:25.255
most recent would-be
suicide bomber.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.909
He was killed right
before he detonated,

14:26.953 --> 14:27.910
just like the first.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.346
Got an ID?
Uh, no hits

14:29.390 --> 14:31.087
on prints or DNA.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.915
But I did find this.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.961
They both have
matching arm tattoos.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.528
Eh?

14:37.572 --> 14:40.314
Looks, uh, pretty patriotic
at first, right?

14:40.357 --> 14:41.576
It's not.Yeah.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.926
JIMMY:
Not according to
this FBI bulletin.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.755
100% actually stands for...100% white.

14:46.798 --> 14:47.887
JIMMY:
Apparently quite popular with

14:47.930 --> 14:49.889
extremist militias these days.

14:49.932 --> 14:53.022
Aren't these guys supposed to
be working withSahar?
Yeah.

14:53.066 --> 14:57.026
Hard to imagine a bunch
of white supremacists

14:57.070 --> 14:58.593
hanging out with someone,
you know,

14:58.636 --> 15:00.943
from her neck of the woods,
if you catch my drift.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.511
Yeah, I get it.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.382
Maybe they were able to bridge
their differences long enough

15:05.426 --> 15:06.949
to commit mass
murder together.

15:06.993 --> 15:10.083
Who knows?
Almost gives you hope.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.432
Send their photos
to Kasie.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.086
She's running facial-recognition
software right now

15:13.129 --> 15:16.916
on every cross-burning,
tiki torch rally she can find.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.919
Oh, and I was thinking
that, uh, Ziva

15:19.962 --> 15:21.442
should have a look
at these guys.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.531
See if she recognizes anyone.

15:23.574 --> 15:24.662
Yeah.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.099
Good idea.
Of course,

15:26.142 --> 15:28.971
I should be the one to
show her the bad guys' photos,

15:29.015 --> 15:30.973
because...
That's a bad idea.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.108
That was hurtful.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.114
â™ª

16:05.529 --> 16:06.748
[grunts]

16:06.791 --> 16:07.967
[groans]

16:08.010 --> 16:10.578
Oh, McGee.
McGee, I'm so sorry.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.232
It's okay.
It's all-all good.
[sighs]

16:12.275 --> 16:15.104
Just a misunderstanding,
everyone.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.150
I was expecting Gibbs, and
not for another half hour.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.021
Well, he sent me.Did he, now?

16:19.065 --> 16:22.155
Yeah. Saved me
from having to beg.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.113
Can I have that hug now?

16:26.115 --> 16:27.377
It's good to see you.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.466
It's a miracle to see you.

16:32.078 --> 16:35.211
So tell me...

16:35.255 --> 16:36.212
why?

16:36.256 --> 16:39.128
You know why.

16:39.172 --> 16:41.043
I had to disappear.

16:41.087 --> 16:44.177
Someone was trying
to kill me, and I had to...No, no.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.048
Why Bishop?
Why not me?

16:46.092 --> 16:48.746
She found me, McGee.
Or was going to.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.402
So, what about Tony?

16:52.446 --> 16:54.752
And Tali. When was
the last time you saw her?

16:57.190 --> 17:01.020
We must all make sacrifices
for our children.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.065
You understand this?

17:03.109 --> 17:04.719
I hear you're a father now?

17:04.762 --> 17:06.677
Yeah.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.505
Look at this.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.987
Oh...

17:12.031 --> 17:13.989
[laughs]

17:14.033 --> 17:16.078
I want to hear all about it,
really, I do,

17:16.122 --> 17:18.298
but now's not the time.No.

17:18.341 --> 17:20.996
Do you have the photos
that Gibbs wanted me to see?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.128
Yeah.

17:24.347 --> 17:27.394
I do not recognize
either of these men.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.091
Any luck with Ari's
old contacts?
Yes.

17:29.135 --> 17:32.529
Turns out my brother was
not only just a part of Hamas,

17:32.573 --> 17:34.966
he was also part of Sahar's
splinter group.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.185
A crucial part.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.144
Until you killed him.
Yes.

17:38.187 --> 17:41.103
After Ari died,
things fell apart.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.801
Sahar's people were hunted down,
their assets were frozen.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.107
And Sahar ended up in prison.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.152
All of which she
blames me for,

17:46.195 --> 17:48.545
and now she's out
for revenge.

17:48.589 --> 17:49.807
Plain and simple.

17:49.851 --> 17:51.635
Well, it's not that simple.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.420
I mean, these suicide bombers,

17:53.463 --> 17:55.291
what do they have to do
with you and Gibbs?

17:55.335 --> 17:56.640
I do not have
all the answers, McGee.

17:56.684 --> 18:00.209
So come with me to NCIS,

18:00.253 --> 18:01.689
and we can answer them together.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.301
I'm not so sure I'm ready

18:05.345 --> 18:08.130
to take that step, but...Sure you are. Come on.

18:08.174 --> 18:11.046
No. You don't understand,
it's not...Okay, I don't understand.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.093
But whatever
you think of us,

18:14.136 --> 18:16.095
we still think of you
as family.

18:22.492 --> 18:25.147
Ziva, come home.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.280
Come home.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.939
[elevator bell dings]

18:41.250 --> 18:43.252
â™ª

19:01.227 --> 19:03.054
Oh.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.989
Oh. I, uh,

19:25.033 --> 19:26.208
didn't expect to see you here.

19:26.252 --> 19:29.080
I'm sorry, I was just, uh...No, you're fine.

19:29.124 --> 19:33.520
I, uh, pretty much read your
entire diary, so we're even.

19:34.912 --> 19:37.872
I was just in MTAC
with Torres.

19:37.915 --> 19:40.918
Uh, we were gonna
head down to Kasie.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.617
I don't think you know her.TORRES: Yikes.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.923
Kasie won't stop
texting me.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.230
She must have found
something pretty, uh...

19:51.277 --> 19:52.452
...important.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.371
That her?Mm-hmm.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.635
Are you gonna say hello?

20:01.678 --> 20:02.853
I'm sizing her up.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.159
Okay.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.247
[stifled laugh]

20:05.291 --> 20:07.684
You must be
Special Agent Torres?

20:07.728 --> 20:10.557
Oh, I see my reputation
has preceded me.

20:11.949 --> 20:14.082
Uh, it's really nice
to finally meet you.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.258
And from one ass-kicking demon
to another,

20:16.302 --> 20:17.825
let me just say that

20:17.868 --> 20:19.174
I really appreciate your work.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.654
Oh, my gosh, did you
really just say that?

20:20.697 --> 20:22.090
Why are you getting
so judgy?

20:22.133 --> 20:24.875
Just, like,
"ass-kicking demon"? Really?

20:24.919 --> 20:28.270
Well, I hope we can pick up
a few pointers from each other.

20:28.314 --> 20:31.839
BISHOP: Or maybe we could
just head down to Kasie's lab,

20:31.882 --> 20:33.319
see what she wants.

20:33.362 --> 20:35.277
Ziva, you're more than
welcome to join us.

20:35.321 --> 20:38.846
Perhaps, but, uh, I think
I'd like to stay here

20:38.889 --> 20:40.456
a while longer, if I may.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.371
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.777
Of course I would win
in a fight.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.387
Mm, I wouldn't be so sure.

20:58.431 --> 20:59.301
Please, she's a girl.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.694
Woman.Woman.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.349
Who are we talking about again?Ziva.

21:03.392 --> 21:04.698
In the flesh.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.613
She's sitting upstairs
as we speak.Oh.

21:06.656 --> 21:08.354
I will call ZNN.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.747
Ziva, as in David.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.053
Yeah, I heard you.

21:12.096 --> 21:14.577
Ziva David,
big bad Mossad assassin,

21:14.621 --> 21:16.753
is sitting upstairs. Ooh!

21:16.797 --> 21:18.973
Possibly in a chair. Ah!

21:19.016 --> 21:21.367
Aren't you a little curious
to meet her?

21:21.410 --> 21:24.195
You know, to be honest, I have
had enough of the hush-hush

21:24.239 --> 21:26.633
and the secretiveness, and I'm
sure she's a very nice person

21:26.676 --> 21:29.070
and I'll meet her
when I meet her, or not.

21:29.113 --> 21:31.246
In the meantime,
do you want to be educated

21:31.290 --> 21:33.596
or do you want
to keep drooling?I don't drool.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.555
Mm, maybe not, but you do have
some egg on your face.

21:35.598 --> 21:38.340
Your report on the
Senate suicide bomb said

21:38.384 --> 21:41.430
this wasn't a dead man's switch,
except it was.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.127
Doesn't look like one.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.390
Because it's not
a spring-trigger,

21:44.433 --> 21:45.478
it's touch-activated.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.350
Wait, so why didn't
the bomb go off

21:48.394 --> 21:49.438
when the bomber dropped it?

21:49.482 --> 21:51.353
Was it a decoy?
Oh, no.

21:51.397 --> 21:54.487
No, these bombs are the
real deal, made of high-end C-4,

21:54.530 --> 21:57.620
but according to the logs
on the detonation processor,

21:57.664 --> 21:59.622
the trigger was disabled
just prior to the attack.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.884
TORRES:
Disabled?

22:00.928 --> 22:02.451
Like, somebody screwed up?

22:02.495 --> 22:04.497
No, this was deliberate.

22:04.540 --> 22:07.238
These bombs
were never gonna go off.

22:07.282 --> 22:08.544
The attack was fake.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.469
So the attacks
were fake?
Yeah.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.602
But why bother
making a real bomb

22:22.645 --> 22:24.168
if you're just gonna disable it?

22:24.212 --> 22:26.214
'Cause needed to look real.But real for what?

22:26.257 --> 22:29.783
Hey, Jack, it's not some Q&A.
I asked you down here for help.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.437
Listen, if you want answers,
you need to find

22:31.480 --> 22:32.960
the people who made those vests,
which means...

22:33.003 --> 22:35.702
Means we need to talk
to Sahar again.
Right.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.878
She should be done
with her arraignment soon.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.575
Hey,

22:39.619 --> 22:42.056
but by "we"
did you mean me,

22:42.099 --> 22:44.450
since you seem to be
avoiding the task?

22:45.538 --> 22:48.845
You're afraid.No, I'm not.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.717
You're afraid
to fail Ziva again.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.719
And if you deny it,

22:52.762 --> 22:54.416
I'm just gonna say it louder.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.592
Got a lead on the vests.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.507
Ah. What do we got?

22:58.551 --> 23:01.989
The bomb detonators are actually
mini programmable computers.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.904
By analyzing
the data caches,

23:03.947 --> 23:05.688
we were able to pull
the IP address

23:05.732 --> 23:06.950
from the PC
that programmed them.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.822
Were you able
to trace it?Kasie was.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.215
The IP address belongs to...

23:12.608 --> 23:15.176
Weird. There's some kind of

23:15.219 --> 23:17.396
RF interference.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.962
Hmm.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.879
Oh, no, please, boss,
don't do that.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.490
BISHOP:
There you go. Okay.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.056
The bomb maker's name

23:26.100 --> 23:28.363
is Dwight Colton,
and he is already on

23:28.407 --> 23:30.060
the FBI watch list for running

23:30.104 --> 23:31.888
an extremist
anti-government militia.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.412
We've traced several
overseas deposits

23:33.455 --> 23:35.196
to Sahar's
bank account,

23:35.239 --> 23:37.067
so Sahar must be
working with him.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.634
Pick him up

23:38.678 --> 23:40.897
before Ziva gets there.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.117
That's a bug.Yeah.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.510
Wait...

23:44.553 --> 23:47.077
Did Ziva bug the bullpen?

23:47.121 --> 23:48.905
Yeah.

23:50.037 --> 23:52.561
TORRES:
I have some movement.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.607
Well, that's not our bomb maker,

23:54.650 --> 23:56.043
but they're
definitely buddies.

23:56.086 --> 23:58.828
Same tattoo.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.177
Well, that makes
three inside.

24:00.221 --> 24:03.746
Actually, four. Heavily armed.
Dwight is with them.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.356
I assume you have a warrant
for his arrest?

24:05.400 --> 24:08.447
We do, and if you had just
stayed with us at NCIS

24:08.490 --> 24:11.058
instead of bugging us,
we could've just told you that.

24:11.101 --> 24:13.495
Just ignore her.
You're paranoid. I get it.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.062
I'm not the only one paranoid.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.630
I do not recommend
entering that building

24:17.673 --> 24:20.328
to serve your warrant.
There will be a standoff.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.373
We don't have time to wait
for them to come out.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.550
You don't have to wait.
Nicholas, you're coming with me.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.116
Eleanor, you're staying
in the car.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.118
You'll know what to do.
Come on. Follow me.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.946
You're the one who said,

24:29.990 --> 24:32.166
"When Ziva asks you
to do something..."

24:35.125 --> 24:37.084
All right,
what's the play?

24:37.127 --> 24:38.912
I'm gonna hit you.
You're gonna hit me back.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.522
They're gonna come out
and watch the fight.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.046
Just, please, make it look real.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.092
Okay, I'm not
gonna hit you.

24:45.135 --> 24:47.094
Come on, you're not
gonna hurt me.

24:47.137 --> 24:50.663
O-Okay, I know you're supposed
to be this major badass,

24:50.706 --> 24:53.796
but this guy is not
gonna hit you.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.015
[grunts]

24:56.582 --> 24:59.236
Hit me.I'm not gonna hit you.

25:00.237 --> 25:01.935
Okay, stop that.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.284
[both grunt][coughing]

25:03.327 --> 25:06.200
Okay.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.028
All right.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.944
Game on, mujer.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.084
Is that all you got?
[laughs]

25:36.360 --> 25:38.928
[chuckling]

25:38.972 --> 25:41.496
Don't be a wuss.
Tell her how you feel.What?

25:41.540 --> 25:44.630
Freeze. NCIS.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.980
Hands up!

25:48.895 --> 25:50.897
Thoughtful design.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.032
Your men are dead.

25:56.076 --> 25:58.295
Martyrs for the cause.

25:58.339 --> 26:00.123
Yeah? What cause is that?

26:00.167 --> 26:02.212
I don't recognize your authority
to ask me questions.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.084
But you do recognize hers.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.912
Right?

26:08.958 --> 26:10.177
You're working with her, right?

26:12.048 --> 26:13.006
We know she planned
the attack.

26:13.049 --> 26:14.311
Her kind
is gonna burn,

26:14.355 --> 26:16.313
just like the rest of you
government thugs.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.011
But for now,

26:18.054 --> 26:20.404
the enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.189
Well, your friend
played your ass.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.583
Those vests you made,

26:24.626 --> 26:28.195
she had them disabled
prior to the attack.

26:28.238 --> 26:30.937
[chuckles] Did she now?Yeah.

26:30.980 --> 26:34.070
The-the dead man's switches
were reprogrammed.

26:34.114 --> 26:37.552
Your bombs were
never gonna explode.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.207
[laughs]

26:40.250 --> 26:43.036
Man, she used you.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.954
Who helped you

26:47.997 --> 26:51.087
get those vests
through security?

26:51.131 --> 26:53.481
I knew he couldn't be trusted.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.744
I want a name.They were working

26:55.788 --> 26:58.094
perfectly when I gave 'em
to that stupid cop.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.663
But the revolution
is still coming.

27:01.707 --> 27:04.579
And the true patriot understands
that the real enemy isn't

27:04.623 --> 27:07.060
plastic straws.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.670
It's an oppressive,
fascist government

27:08.714 --> 27:10.193
that cares more
about clean air

27:10.237 --> 27:11.281
than freedom.

27:11.325 --> 27:12.631
You mean like this guy?

27:14.371 --> 27:15.851
[knocking on door]

27:15.895 --> 27:18.288
McGEE:
Chief Freydano, NCIS.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.247
Open up.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.771
He's not here.You were supposed to wait

27:22.815 --> 27:24.599
for my signal
before you went in.You took too long.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.166
House is empty.
Suitcase is missing.

27:26.209 --> 27:29.299
[sighs] He must've figured out
we connected him to Sahar.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.260
Perhaps we can
find something

27:33.303 --> 27:36.002
that'll tell us
where he's going.

27:36.045 --> 27:38.178
I miss doing this
with you, Ziva.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.006
Though what I really miss
is that I didn't get to see

27:40.049 --> 27:41.311
you and Torres fight.[chuckles]

27:41.355 --> 27:44.053
What I wouldn't give
to see him get his a...

27:45.446 --> 27:46.621
McGee.
Hey, boss.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.971
Freydano was
already gone.

27:49.015 --> 27:50.407
Thought you were headed down
to Capitol Police.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.148
Uh, no, Bishop's on that.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.889
She tell you about
the bank transfer we found?

27:53.933 --> 27:55.369
Turns out
that Freydano,

27:55.412 --> 27:56.762
he's a gun for hire...

27:56.805 --> 27:58.285
Hey, Tim?
Yeah.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.243
Go check out the house, okay?

28:00.287 --> 28:03.246
Okay. Check the house.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.991
Left something.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.645
Do you think
you would've found that

28:10.689 --> 28:12.212
if I didn't want you to?I don't know.

28:12.255 --> 28:14.040
I miss things sometimes.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.217
So I hear.

28:17.260 --> 28:21.177
Ha. I see you've been
talking to Ducky.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.570
Ziva,

28:22.613 --> 28:24.703
I didn't come looking
for you because you died.

28:27.401 --> 28:28.968
Did they ever find a body?

28:29.925 --> 28:31.579
You asked me where
I got this scar.

28:31.622 --> 28:32.667
I got it in Paraguay.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.103
The second I heard
you and McGee

28:34.147 --> 28:35.496
had been kidnapped,
I flew down

28:35.539 --> 28:37.193
to South America.
My contacts said you were dead.

28:37.237 --> 28:38.934
But still,
I spent months

28:38.978 --> 28:42.155
turning over every rock in
every hellhole looking for you.

28:42.198 --> 28:44.592
The rescue helicopter
only beat me by an hour.

28:44.635 --> 28:47.290
And after they pulled you out,
did it never occur to you

28:47.334 --> 28:50.511
to wonder why no one
came looking for revenge?

28:50.554 --> 28:54.515
I got this scar
making sure no one could.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.604
That is what you do
for the people you love.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.650
That is what you do for your
family. What did you do for me?

28:59.694 --> 29:00.739
Nothing!

29:00.782 --> 29:02.653
You couldn't even hope

29:02.697 --> 29:04.655
I was still alive.

29:12.663 --> 29:16.667
Sorry, boss, I was, uh, waiting
for a pause in the conversation.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.582
Okay.Found something
in the house.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.541
You know,

29:20.584 --> 29:22.412
I'm thinking I shouldn't have
left you two alone.

29:22.456 --> 29:25.981
What'd you find?Freydano had a burn phone.

29:26.025 --> 29:29.680
Maybe it'll help us find out
where he's running to.

29:29.724 --> 29:33.336
Did I hear someone
mention Paraguay?

29:33.380 --> 29:34.642
DUCKY:
You rang?

29:34.685 --> 29:36.644
Ah, you are just the Duckster
I wanted to see.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.515
I found something
on that cop's phone

29:38.559 --> 29:39.908
that I wanted
to run by you.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.475
Oh, of course.

29:41.518 --> 29:44.304
Was it useful in finding
Chief Freydano's whereabouts?

29:44.347 --> 29:47.350
Uh, not yet, but I did manage
to partially reconstruct

29:47.394 --> 29:50.005
a video chat between
him and Sahar.

29:50.049 --> 29:52.355
So they are
working together.Yeah.

29:52.399 --> 29:54.749
And, naturally,
you'd like my opinion

29:54.793 --> 29:58.274
as to why a decorated
police officer would...

29:58.318 --> 29:59.885
We already know.
Money.

29:59.928 --> 30:02.148
Oh.
And we were right.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.541
According to their texts,
the suicide attacks

30:04.585 --> 30:06.500
were just a distraction.

30:06.543 --> 30:07.849
And you would like me
to determine

30:07.893 --> 30:09.590
why Sahar needed
a distraction?

30:09.633 --> 30:10.765
Oh, I already
know that, too.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.506
Apparently, the entire point

30:12.549 --> 30:14.116
was to trick the Capitol Police

30:14.160 --> 30:17.163
into activating something called
the Iron Citadel protocol,

30:17.206 --> 30:18.729
whatever that is.

30:18.773 --> 30:21.776
Oh, it's an obscure provision
of the Patriot Act.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.778
But what has
all this to do

30:23.822 --> 30:26.650
with Sahar's vendetta
against Ziva?

30:26.694 --> 30:30.306
Oh, that's why you
invited me down here.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.874
You want me to postulate
theories as to...

30:32.918 --> 30:34.528
Sorry, no.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.573
May I have a lifeline?

30:36.617 --> 30:39.533
I called you down here
because I also traced

30:39.576 --> 30:44.581
several phone calls
between Chief Freydano and you.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.064
Me?

30:49.108 --> 30:50.544
Which makes it seem like

30:50.587 --> 30:53.286
you're secretly working
with Sahar.

30:53.329 --> 30:55.549
[chuckles]: But that
obviously can't be true.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.943
Right?Well, of course not.

30:57.986 --> 31:00.684
I mean, I don't even have
my phone. I lent it to Z...

31:00.728 --> 31:02.730
Oh. Yeah, see,

31:02.773 --> 31:06.386
it looked like your lips were
just about to make a "Z" sound.

31:06.429 --> 31:07.909
[grunts softly]As in, you know...

31:07.953 --> 31:10.825
The last time I saw her,
Ziva asked to borrow it.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.046
Oh, well, she just got
a lot more interesting.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.439
Well, this cannot be
what it looks like.

31:16.483 --> 31:17.963
Good. Because what it looks like

31:18.006 --> 31:20.530
is that Ziva
is secretly working with Sahar.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.837
The terrorist lady.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.848
Ziva's not answering her phone.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.154
Ping it.BISHOP:
I'm trying,

31:35.197 --> 31:37.069
but she must have
disabled the battery.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.635
When was the last time
you saw her?

31:38.679 --> 31:39.985
At Chief Freydano's house.

31:40.028 --> 31:42.030
Ziva knew his burn phone
would lead us back to her.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.771
That's why she split.BISHOP:
No.

31:43.814 --> 31:46.208
This cannot be what it looks
like. Ziva is not helping Sahar.

31:46.252 --> 31:48.254
Gibbs, canthis be
what it looks like?

31:48.297 --> 31:51.648
Either way, we played
right into Sahar's hands.

31:51.692 --> 31:54.042
She wanted us to invoke
the IC protocol.

31:54.086 --> 31:56.653
Why?I can't even begin to imagine
what she would gain by it.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.481
If anything,
the authority that it grants us

31:58.525 --> 32:00.135
makes it easier
to round her people up.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.137
And we're gonna
need that authority.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.443
Sahar's escaped.

32:03.486 --> 32:05.488
What? How?She was on her way

32:05.532 --> 32:07.142
to a federal holding facility.

32:07.186 --> 32:08.230
Someone rammed her transport.

32:08.274 --> 32:09.492
TORRES:
"Someone," huh?

32:09.536 --> 32:11.146
Sounds like a "Z" coming.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.234
Sahar wants Ziva dead. Remember?

32:12.278 --> 32:14.062
So, it could easily have been

32:14.106 --> 32:15.324
Chief Freydano
that busted her out.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.979
Nope, couldn't be,
'cause Freydano

32:18.023 --> 32:20.895
was picked up by airport police
trying to leave the country.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.071
Which brings us back to Z...We're not going there.

32:23.115 --> 32:25.117
Uh...No, no. No. Leon, not yet.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.075
Him.

32:27.119 --> 32:29.773
Him. Bring him in.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.906
I want a deal.I don't care what you want.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.255
You have no idea
what's happening.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.127
We know you and Sahar
are working together.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.780
What's that called, again?Treason.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.521
Treason. You're gonna hang.

32:38.565 --> 32:39.609
GIBBS:
You want a deal?

32:39.653 --> 32:41.916
You get to live. That's it.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.178
Talk.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.050
TORRES:
Why is Sahar
so interested

32:45.093 --> 32:47.182
in that Iron Citadel thing?

32:47.226 --> 32:48.792
What's this got to do
with Ziva David?

32:50.751 --> 32:52.622
You have it all wrong.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.755
Sahar doesn't
want Ziva dead.

32:54.798 --> 32:58.150
Ziva's helping Sahar
rebuild her organization.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.630
Bull.
I didn't say
willingly.

33:00.674 --> 33:03.807
In fact, Sahar's original plan
was to kidnap you

33:03.851 --> 33:05.896
and force Ziva
to help her.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.029
Keep talking.

33:09.074 --> 33:11.076
But Ziva was able to warn you,

33:11.119 --> 33:15.297
so Sahar had
to improvise a plan B.

33:15.341 --> 33:17.517
She made an offer to Ziva

33:17.560 --> 33:19.736
when they were alone together
in the police station.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.738
You owe these people nothing.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.262
They abandoned you.

33:23.305 --> 33:24.741
I owe you even less.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.743
But if you help us,

33:26.787 --> 33:28.963
you can have your life back.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.096
This was
never about you.

33:31.139 --> 33:33.750
All we want is liberty
for our people.

33:33.794 --> 33:36.188
And no one else needs to die.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.059
It wasn't even that hard a sell.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.888
When Ziva got back to D.C.,
she contacted me.

33:40.931 --> 33:43.195
I arranged for a special drive

33:43.238 --> 33:45.849
to be delivered to her
with a list of accounts.

33:45.893 --> 33:48.069
Once she was inside NCIS,

33:48.113 --> 33:51.290
which only Ziva David could do,

33:51.333 --> 33:54.293
she gained access
to your director's office...

33:57.252 --> 33:59.080
...and used
the emergency powers

33:59.124 --> 34:01.735
granted to your agency
to access over $50 million

34:01.778 --> 34:05.217
in frozen assets
belonging to Sahar's group.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.136
The group that fell apart
after Ari was killed.

34:12.267 --> 34:14.139
Sahar's trying to rebuild it.

34:14.182 --> 34:16.315
What better way to show
her worth to her people

34:16.358 --> 34:20.841
than to use the very person
that took it down?

34:24.845 --> 34:26.934
You check cameras?

34:26.977 --> 34:29.371
Disabled. And it looks like
Sahar's assets

34:29.415 --> 34:31.852
were transferred to over
a dozen overseas banks.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.462
Where?Routing numbers
are masked.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.769
But boss, this doesn't mean
that we know that Ziva...

34:35.812 --> 34:38.119
Got a match.Her prints are
all over the room.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.729
VANCE:
Well, that settles that.

34:39.773 --> 34:40.948
Gibbs, this isn't Ziva's fault.

34:40.991 --> 34:42.167
I mean, if she thought
this was the only way

34:42.210 --> 34:43.994
to get her life back,
to see her daughter?

34:44.038 --> 34:45.822
She'd do anything.
TORRES:
The question is,

34:45.866 --> 34:46.823
what is she doing now?

34:46.867 --> 34:48.651
McGee, get Treasury over here.

34:48.695 --> 34:49.652
On it.
Torres,

34:49.696 --> 34:50.914
airport checkpoints.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.307
On it.
Bishop,

34:52.351 --> 34:54.788
BOLO on Ziva.

34:54.831 --> 34:55.919
To be arrested on sight.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.747
You may not need that BOLO.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.662
Ducky's cell just
came back on line.

34:59.706 --> 35:00.794
I think Ziva made a call.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.317
And I got a location.

35:06.016 --> 35:07.757
Wow, I'm starting to think
we need to up our security

35:07.801 --> 35:09.846
around here.I'm starting to think

35:09.890 --> 35:11.413
I shouldn't have
had that Big Gulp.

35:11.457 --> 35:12.980
It will not be
for much longer, gentlemen.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.199
ANDREWS:
Ma'am,

35:14.242 --> 35:16.026
this is a felony.

35:16.070 --> 35:19.726
Now, it's not too late to put
the toothpaste back in the tube.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.946
This is for your protection.
Enough people have been hurt.

35:22.990 --> 35:23.991
[door opens]

35:25.210 --> 35:26.863
Uh...
[shushes]

35:30.650 --> 35:32.173
Is it done?

35:32.217 --> 35:33.174
I transferred your assets.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.524
All bank information is here.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.874
Verify it, then upload the data.

35:37.918 --> 35:40.181
I did what you asked of me.
I freed your money.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.009
Now I want your word
it ends here.

35:42.052 --> 35:46.361
Yes, I did give you my word.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.929
It's not really
an even trade, is it?

35:48.972 --> 35:51.192
It took over a
decade to climb out

35:51.236 --> 35:53.934
from the rubble you made
of all of our lives.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.850
We were tortured
for years

35:56.893 --> 35:57.981
in that POW camp.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.418
We barely survived.

36:04.945 --> 36:06.555
But you did stick

36:06.599 --> 36:08.122
to your end of the bargain.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.037
And I would like
to uphold mine.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.300
Unfortunately,
it's not up to me.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.912
I'm sorry. Kill her.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.828
NCIS. Freeze.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.439
Nobody move.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.092
You're under arrest.

36:23.746 --> 36:24.965
You're all under arrest.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.885
You're too late.

36:31.928 --> 36:33.756
Am I?

36:33.800 --> 36:38.326
Actually, you're right on time.

36:39.719 --> 36:41.851
I transferred your assets, yes.

36:41.895 --> 36:43.810
But I also alerted Interpol.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.073
So, when your people go
to retrieve their money,

36:46.116 --> 36:48.380
they'll be arrested.

36:49.424 --> 36:50.904
Ziva.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.949
It's over.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.998
Seems that it is.

36:58.041 --> 37:01.871
And that I underestimated
you all. Or did I?

37:01.915 --> 37:05.266
Tell me. When I made the
offer to you back there,

37:05.310 --> 37:07.877
were you playing me
from the beginning?

37:07.921 --> 37:10.010
Or did you actually consider it?

37:10.053 --> 37:12.882
I don't kiss and show.

37:12.926 --> 37:14.449
[whispers]:
"Tell."

37:14.493 --> 37:17.278
Either way, so much for plan B.SAHAR:
Yes.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.846
But I will not be going back
to prison.

37:19.889 --> 37:22.631
Time for plan C.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.134
How'd you know?

37:48.178 --> 37:50.964
I didn't.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.270
Hoped.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.713
And you're not that sloppy.

38:00.756 --> 38:05.065
Tracked you when you turned
Ducky's GPS back on.

38:07.023 --> 38:09.374
[insects trilling]

38:25.085 --> 38:26.652
You're gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

38:29.045 --> 38:33.006
I heard Interpol arrested the
last of Sahar's splinter group.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.661
Her organization is destroyed.
That's good.

38:35.704 --> 38:37.837
You lied to me.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.801
I know. And for that, I'm sorry.

38:45.845 --> 38:47.368
But it was the only way
my plan would work.

38:47.412 --> 38:48.630
Do you really think
Vance would have

38:48.674 --> 38:50.066
allowed me
to transfer the assets?

38:50.110 --> 38:52.242
But I'm not, I'm not Vance.I know.

38:54.027 --> 38:56.029
I'm sorry,
but I have to get going.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.509
I didn't go looking for you
after you blew up...

38:57.552 --> 39:01.077
[sighs] Gibbs....because I had
lost you once before.

39:01.121 --> 39:05.386
And I get it in my head
that you're alive

39:05.430 --> 39:08.084
and I'm out there
looking and it turns out

39:08.128 --> 39:11.000
you're not...

39:11.044 --> 39:13.786
I would've, uh...

39:18.225 --> 39:20.227
I would've...

39:25.450 --> 39:30.977
I would have lost you a thousand
times, if that's what it took.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.330
I waited for you, Gibbs.

39:37.810 --> 39:41.596
I waited and I waited
and I waited.

39:45.165 --> 39:48.124
And you never came.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.519
I made a mistake.

39:52.564 --> 39:55.131
[sighs]

39:55.175 --> 39:58.308
Where to now, Ziva?

40:04.227 --> 40:06.621
There's one more thing
I have to do

40:06.665 --> 40:08.841
before I can
put this all behind me.

40:08.884 --> 40:12.018
And this time,

40:12.061 --> 40:14.368
I have to do it alone.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.421
[phone ringing]

40:28.774 --> 40:30.253
I called him after
you went missing,

40:30.297 --> 40:32.386
and I left a message.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.563
What did you say?Nothing.

40:35.607 --> 40:37.783
He should hear it from you.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.090
And he will.

40:44.354 --> 40:46.356
