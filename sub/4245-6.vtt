WEBVTT

00:05.500 --> 00:06.933
Why are you here?

00:07.001 --> 00:08.802
You can't be here.

00:11.205 --> 00:13.539
I didn't kill Amanda Tanner.

00:13.607 --> 00:14.773
I know.

00:14.841 --> 00:17.042
Her baby... it wasn't yours.

00:17.110 --> 00:18.711
But it could have been.

00:18.778 --> 00:20.078
Really?

00:20.146 --> 00:22.447
You really want me to detail
for you how and where

00:22.516 --> 00:24.583
and in what positions
Amanda Tanner and I had sex?

00:24.651 --> 00:26.418
Would that help make you
feel better? 'Cause I'll do it.

00:26.486 --> 00:27.452
No.

00:27.520 --> 00:28.887
You left me. I was unhappy.

00:28.954 --> 00:30.855
She was there. One time.
I I made a mistake.

00:30.923 --> 00:32.456
I don't want to talk about it.

00:32.525 --> 00:34.425
You cheated on your mistress
with your girlfriend.

00:34.493 --> 00:35.827
Let's just leave it at that.

00:35.895 --> 00:37.395
She wasn't my girlfriend.

00:37.462 --> 00:41.733
Don't you ever call yourself
a mistress. We both know better.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.234
Why are you here?

00:46.971 --> 00:49.039
Cyrus got this in the mail
a week ago.

00:49.106 --> 00:52.208
It's a sex tape. I'm on it.
I need you to hear it.

00:52.276 --> 00:53.977
I <i>definitely</i> don't want

00:54.045 --> 00:56.212
to hear you and Amanda Tanner
having sex.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.882
Olivia.

00:58.950 --> 01:01.184
I need you to listen to this.

01:08.892 --> 01:10.126
Well, there's no way
to sugarcoat it.

01:10.194 --> 01:11.594
We got our ass handed to us

01:11.662 --> 01:13.196
by Sally Langston
in Iowa last night.

01:13.264 --> 01:16.032
So anyone have any great ideas?

01:18.401 --> 01:19.834
Anyone?

01:19.902 --> 01:21.470
We have to swing farther right.

01:21.538 --> 01:24.106
We haven't said a thing about
gay marriage, school prayer...

01:24.174 --> 01:25.974
oh, come on. It's not
our stances on the issues.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.277
We are not getting our message
out there.

01:28.344 --> 01:29.945
People don't know
where I stand.

01:30.012 --> 01:31.947
The problem is...
your marriage.

01:32.014 --> 01:36.016
It looks like
you don't screw your wife...

01:36.085 --> 01:37.452
Which would be fine,

01:37.519 --> 01:39.487
except that family values
matter to Republicans.

01:39.555 --> 01:41.422
It's why they vote for
who they vote for.

01:41.490 --> 01:44.525
And since Sally's got Jesus
firmly on her side,

01:44.593 --> 01:46.627
that just leaves family,
marriage,

01:46.695 --> 01:49.129
and yours...
whatever the truth may be...

01:49.197 --> 01:52.532
from the outside,
it looks cold, distant, dead.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.502
Where is your wife, by the way?

01:55.570 --> 01:59.406
People want to like
who they're voting for.

01:59.474 --> 02:01.341
Voters thought Al Gore was
a big stiff

02:01.409 --> 02:03.643
until he stuck his tongue
down tipper's throat.

02:03.711 --> 02:06.212
They put George W. in office
because he and Laura

02:06.279 --> 02:07.980
seemed like a fun couple
to have a beer with.

02:08.047 --> 02:10.316
People have to want
to invite you in for dinner,

02:10.383 --> 02:13.219
and right now, you and your wife
are standing in their doorway,

02:13.286 --> 02:14.853
3 feet apart,
not looking at each other,

02:14.921 --> 02:16.422
letting in the cold air.

02:16.490 --> 02:18.224
That's why you lost Iowa.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.992
It's why you'll lose
New Hampshire.

02:21.059 --> 02:22.594
And you are?

02:22.661 --> 02:23.894
Olivia...

02:23.962 --> 02:25.597
Pope.

02:31.403 --> 02:34.903
Sync & corrections by into-the-light,
www.addic7ed.com

02:34.973 --> 02:36.340
fire her.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.907
Ah, she's great, right?
A pistol.

02:37.975 --> 02:39.976
Lives for her work, a political
nun, best student I ever had.

02:40.044 --> 02:42.312
Fire her. 'Cause she said what
every staffer on your campaign

02:42.380 --> 02:43.747
was afraid to say?

02:43.814 --> 02:45.081
Just get rid of her.

02:47.985 --> 02:50.187
I'll charge my hotel room
to the campaign. Don't worry.

02:50.255 --> 02:52.255
I haven't had a chance
to raid the hotel minibar.

02:52.322 --> 02:53.623
Liv...
best of luck, governor.

02:55.325 --> 02:57.960
Let's be clear about something.
I run a sausage factory.

02:58.028 --> 02:59.128
Which makes me sausage?

02:59.196 --> 03:00.963
Handsome,
highly qualified, smart,

03:01.031 --> 03:02.898
idealistic,
and energetic sausage.

03:02.966 --> 03:04.800
Cy... the stump, the electrifying
speeches, the baby kissing...

03:04.868 --> 03:06.169
that's all you.

03:06.236 --> 03:08.003
The nitty-gritty,
morally bankrupt,

03:08.071 --> 03:10.272
back-alley-brawling
rest of the game...

03:10.339 --> 03:12.541
that's me. It's filthy
and thankless,

03:12.608 --> 03:14.976
and it's my hallelujah, heroin,
and reason to breathe.

03:15.044 --> 03:16.944
And you... you don't have half
the stomach for it,

03:17.012 --> 03:19.347
so you go and you make nice
with Olivia Pope.

03:19.415 --> 03:22.484
Get her back, or you can find
another sausage maker.

03:22.552 --> 03:24.653
Ms. Pope?

03:24.720 --> 03:26.420
Ms. Pope, wait. I...

03:27.756 --> 03:29.924
I apologize for firing you.

03:29.992 --> 03:30.958
Why?

03:31.026 --> 03:32.259
Why do I apologize?

03:32.327 --> 03:33.294
Why did you fire me?

03:33.361 --> 03:35.029
I had a job,

03:35.097 --> 03:36.731
a paying job, from which
I took a leave of absence

03:36.799 --> 03:38.399
to do a favor
for my friend Cyrus

03:38.466 --> 03:40.734
because I am good.
I am brilliant.

03:40.802 --> 03:42.169
I would eat, breathe,

03:42.236 --> 03:44.270
and live Fitzgerald grant
every minute of every day.

03:44.338 --> 03:45.772
You would be lucky to have me.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.940
Just because you don't like

03:47.008 --> 03:48.208
hearing the truth about
yourself...

03:48.275 --> 03:50.010
I loved hearing
what you had to say.

03:50.078 --> 03:51.978
I agree with every word.
Very astute.

03:52.046 --> 03:54.247
And you're right.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.850
I would be lucky to have you.

04:08.795 --> 04:10.162
Look...

04:13.298 --> 04:16.267
This is why you fired me.

04:16.334 --> 04:17.969
Can we just...

04:18.036 --> 04:19.470
go back in there and work.
Okay.

04:19.538 --> 04:20.504
Okay.

04:26.378 --> 04:28.912
Oh, it's perfect to meet you.
Yeah, thank you for having us.

04:28.980 --> 04:30.047
How are you, Sally?
Hi.

04:35.419 --> 04:37.788
Put down the butter.

04:37.856 --> 04:39.189
I don't know what you're talking about.

04:39.257 --> 04:41.125
I can hear my mixer again, Abby.
Butter won't fix it.

04:41.192 --> 04:42.692
So are you
a rabid republican yet?

04:48.598 --> 04:49.531
Hello? Liv?

04:49.599 --> 04:51.734
He's got...

04:51.802 --> 04:53.936
Something I can work with.

04:54.004 --> 04:56.239
Go to it then. You don't have
to check on me every day.

04:56.306 --> 04:58.241
I'm not deranged.
I'm just divorced.

04:58.308 --> 04:59.809
So stop feeling sorry for
yourself. Get out of my kitchen.

04:59.877 --> 05:01.143
Call my friend Stephen.

05:01.210 --> 05:02.543
He's fun.

05:02.611 --> 05:05.213
Stop trying to get laid.
Maybe I'll buy a gun.

05:05.281 --> 05:07.149
Okay. Bye.

05:07.216 --> 05:09.217
Ooh, he's good, our boy.

05:09.285 --> 05:11.552
You'd never know he's dying
to rip Langston's throat out.

05:11.620 --> 05:14.422
If only he were that good
at faking it with his wife

05:14.490 --> 05:15.924
we wouldn't be losing.

05:15.992 --> 05:17.491
Schedule of events?

05:17.558 --> 05:19.059
Thanks. What's your name?

05:19.127 --> 05:20.627
Amanda.
Thanks, Amanda.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.462
I don't care which campaign
you're volunteering for.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.965
I want to thank you
for coming out today.

05:39.914 --> 05:42.081
Alissa, cancel your plans.

05:42.149 --> 05:43.549
We're working late tonight.

05:53.565 --> 05:54.564
Mm.

05:54.631 --> 05:56.099
Mm.

05:56.167 --> 05:57.733
This is really good.

05:57.801 --> 05:58.969
I know.

05:59.036 --> 06:01.704
No, I mean like
award-winning good,

06:01.772 --> 06:03.940
like you should quit your job.
'Cause let's face it,

06:04.008 --> 06:05.976
you're kind of a crap reporter.

06:06.043 --> 06:08.511
Mm-hmm. Go out on the road in your
car and sell this grilled cheese.

06:08.579 --> 06:10.145
Wait. You have a car, right?

06:10.213 --> 06:11.146
'Cause I can't date you
if you don't have a car.

06:11.214 --> 06:13.682
I have a car.

06:13.749 --> 06:14.783
I also...

06:16.086 --> 06:18.687
I have...
A deadline tomorrow.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.061
Yeah, I sh... I'm sorry.
I should go.

06:27.129 --> 06:29.430
No. No. I didn't mean that.
You shouldn't go.

06:29.498 --> 06:32.467
You should stay. I just have
to work for a couple of hours,

06:32.534 --> 06:34.102
but you should stay here,
naked...

06:34.169 --> 06:35.703
And beautiful...

06:35.770 --> 06:37.671
And here, in my bed.

06:37.739 --> 06:38.839
Stay here.

06:38.907 --> 06:40.808
Please.

07:03.563 --> 07:05.431
Ah, did you get
moo shu chicken?

07:05.499 --> 07:07.733
No wonder it took you so long.
How do you even walk in those?

07:07.800 --> 07:09.368
I got whatever you ordered.

07:09.436 --> 07:11.203
And these shoes aren't made
for walking.

07:11.271 --> 07:12.604
They are made
for getting me laid,

07:12.672 --> 07:14.972
specifically, they are
for the very hot bartender

07:15.041 --> 07:16.807
at the black cat, where I would
be having a drink right now

07:16.875 --> 07:18.076
if I didn't happen to work

07:18.144 --> 07:19.677
for an obsessive-compulsive
slave driver

07:19.745 --> 07:21.746
who makes me fetch him dinner
at 10:30 on a Thursday night.

07:21.813 --> 07:24.015
You know, if you spent less time
at the black cat

07:24.083 --> 07:25.583
and more time studying
for the bar exam,

07:25.651 --> 07:27.285
you wouldn't be fetching
your boss anything

07:27.353 --> 07:28.586
because at law firms,
they have assistants for that.

07:28.654 --> 07:30.187
Lots of lawyers fail the bar.

07:30.255 --> 07:32.122
All lawyers pass the bar.
That's what makes them lawyers.

07:36.127 --> 07:38.562
Alissa, eat something.
We have a murder to solve.

07:38.629 --> 07:40.164
No, we don't.

07:40.231 --> 07:42.666
Coroner says it's a suicide,
and the police agree with her,

07:42.733 --> 07:44.000
which is why I went home
two hours ago,

07:44.069 --> 07:46.635
because work was over.

07:46.703 --> 07:50.139
Amanda Tanner...
27, single, 13 weeks pregnant...

07:50.207 --> 07:52.275
Worked as an aide
at the grant White House

07:52.342 --> 07:54.643
till just a couple weeks ago
when she abruptly resigned

07:54.711 --> 07:56.412
and botched a suicide attempt.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.781
Then she becomes
a client of Olivia Pope's,

07:58.848 --> 08:01.317
and we pull her dead body
out of the river.

08:01.385 --> 08:03.885
Don't you find that
interesting?

08:03.953 --> 08:06.288
Well, pretend you do, for me.

08:06.355 --> 08:08.190
Now if you did happen
to find any of this

08:08.257 --> 08:11.560
remotely fascinating,
incongruous, intriguing,

08:11.627 --> 08:13.361
worthy of our time,

08:13.429 --> 08:15.797
what's the first question you
might ask about Amanda Tanner?

08:15.864 --> 08:18.199
Well, um,

08:18.266 --> 08:20.201
who in the White House
would want her dead?

08:22.504 --> 08:25.306
You canceled all our events
for the next two days?

08:25.373 --> 08:26.673
Yes. The primary's
in less than a week.

08:26.741 --> 08:27.741
We can't miss two days
of campaigning.

08:27.809 --> 08:29.210
New Hampshire's a small state.

08:29.277 --> 08:31.044
I have a literacy fund-raiser
in nashua tomorrow.

08:31.113 --> 08:33.679
I can't possibly cancel that.
That's why I canceled it for you.

08:36.150 --> 08:38.284
Maybe I'm dense,
but I have to confess,

08:38.352 --> 08:40.352
I don't really know
what you want from us.

08:40.421 --> 08:42.455
First off, I'd like you to
actually talk to each other.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.258
We talk all the time, Ms. Pope.

08:45.326 --> 08:46.692
Not to each other, you don't.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.394
House parties, town hall
meetings, baseball games...

08:48.462 --> 08:50.362
you barely look at each other.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.864
Fine. We will add a couple
of events to the schedule

08:52.932 --> 08:54.500
where we are together.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.135
That won't do it.
You two need to be a couple.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.704
A believable, loving,
dedicated couple.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.541
Or you might as well
throw it in right now.

09:07.779 --> 09:09.580
Why don't we give you two
a moment?

09:13.519 --> 09:15.953
Why are you fighting this?
It's what you wanted.

09:16.021 --> 09:18.222
It's what you've always wanted. What <i>i</i> wanted?
You are the one running for president.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.458
Oh, please, like you're
not running for first lady?

09:20.526 --> 09:21.792
You're dying to get
into that White House.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.026
You're practically
redecorating already.

09:23.093 --> 09:24.628
Okay, there it is.
I am the ambitious monster.

09:24.695 --> 09:25.762
I'm the iron lady.

09:25.829 --> 09:27.830
I have done everything for you!

09:27.898 --> 09:29.432
I have sacrificed
my career for you.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.234
I have had kids for you.

09:31.302 --> 09:34.204
There is not a single thing
in my life I have not given up

09:34.272 --> 09:35.438
so that you could be
president...

09:35.506 --> 09:36.939
I never asked you
for any of that.

09:37.007 --> 09:39.208
And all I get in turn is
this perpetual resentment!

09:39.276 --> 09:40.876
So what would you prefer?
That I ignore you?

09:40.943 --> 09:42.645
That we don't talk at all?
'Cause that's pretty much

09:42.712 --> 09:44.213
how it's been the past few
years, and that's worked okay.

09:44.281 --> 09:45.881
Now you're just being juvenile.

09:45.948 --> 09:48.450
This is why they don't
talk to each other.

09:50.487 --> 09:51.720
- No.
-  'Cause you're afraid

09:51.788 --> 09:53.255
it would get out
and kill us politically.

09:53.323 --> 09:54.855
If they found out,
we'd be dead in the water!

09:54.923 --> 09:57.124
Fine! Then if living
on Pennsylvania Avenue

09:57.193 --> 09:58.993
is that important to you,
we better suck it up

09:59.061 --> 10:02.197
and start acting like
this isn't a dead marriage!

10:02.264 --> 10:03.998
Governor, you're 5 points down
in New Hampshire.

10:04.066 --> 10:05.766
Taking time out from
the primary for

10:05.834 --> 10:07.968
a parent-teacher conference...
isn't that a little risky?

10:08.036 --> 10:09.937
If it's a choice between losing
touch with your family

10:10.005 --> 10:13.173
and losing a primary, that's
not really a choice, is it?

10:13.241 --> 10:15.075
You can't wear this tie
on morning TV.

10:15.142 --> 10:16.610
What? It's too distracting.
Take it off.

10:16.678 --> 10:18.579
Give me your tie, please.
Give me your tie. Take it off.

10:18.646 --> 10:20.814
Off, off, off, off. Thank you.

10:20.881 --> 10:21.781
Okay.

10:24.085 --> 10:26.885
You decide
who you're voting for?

10:26.953 --> 10:28.487
I'm apolitical.

10:28.555 --> 10:31.824
You don't sleep, you rip ties
off innocent bystanders for me,

10:31.891 --> 10:34.427
you're killing yourself 24/7
to get me elected,

10:34.494 --> 10:36.362
and I don't even have your vote.

10:36.430 --> 10:38.731
Well, you're gonna need
to earn it,

10:38.798 --> 10:41.133
like any other candidate.

10:41.201 --> 10:45.637
If my research is right,

10:45.705 --> 10:49.341
that's right.
Oh, and uh, Fitz did fine, too.

10:50.610 --> 10:51.743
Not bad.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.612
They're still not touching.

10:57.383 --> 10:58.882
One more.

11:00.084 --> 11:01.485
There you go. One more.

11:01.553 --> 11:03.887
Very good job.
That's great.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.223
It's your turn. It's your turn, Fitz.
Okay, it's my turn.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.258
Mm-hmm.

11:07.325 --> 11:08.425
Delicious!

11:09.761 --> 11:12.028
Oh, wipe it off. Wipe it off.

11:12.096 --> 11:13.597
Wipe it off.
Wipe it.

11:13.665 --> 11:15.131
Wipe it off. Wipe it off, Mellie.
Come on. Come on.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.434
Oh. Thank you.

11:18.502 --> 11:20.002
Perfect.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.938
Ice cream, anyone?

11:25.776 --> 11:27.943
Ugh! Who in the holy hell is
running that campaign?

11:28.011 --> 11:29.979
As far as I know, they haven't
made any official changes.

11:30.046 --> 11:32.614
Oh, yeah. That is a big, old
pile of dung, Billy chambers,

11:32.682 --> 11:34.316
and you know it.

11:34.384 --> 11:36.885
That is not the Fitzgerald grant
I ran against in Iowa.

11:36.952 --> 11:38.420
That is a candidate, Billy,

11:38.488 --> 11:40.255
a down-home, charming,

11:40.323 --> 11:41.823
red-blooded candidate
who's stealing my votes.

11:41.891 --> 11:43.325
Hell, I'm halfway
to voting for him.

11:43.393 --> 11:45.160
Now I want to find out
who's responsible

11:45.227 --> 11:46.727
so we can see
what we're dealing with here.

11:46.795 --> 11:48.262
I'm on it.

11:48.330 --> 11:50.964
Billy, it is not in God's plan
that I lose New Hampshire.

11:51.032 --> 11:53.601
Senator, I promise you,

11:53.669 --> 11:56.771
we will <i>not</i> lose New Hampshire.

11:56.838 --> 11:58.939
I'm a little superstitious,

11:59.007 --> 12:00.608
so we're not gonna have
any victory speeches

12:00.676 --> 12:02.343
until tomorrow night,
after everyone's voted.

12:02.411 --> 12:05.779
But for now, I just really
want to say thank you.

12:05.847 --> 12:07.815
Okay. Thanks. It's all you guys.

12:11.853 --> 12:14.855
Olivia Pope...

12:14.923 --> 12:16.824
I don't know how you do it.

12:16.891 --> 12:18.692
Oh, if we're passing out
credit, governor,

12:18.759 --> 12:20.659
you and Mellie
deserve most of it.

12:20.727 --> 12:23.229
You two seem to be
doing much better.

12:25.665 --> 12:28.968
I think you underestimate
how good a politician I am.

12:31.571 --> 12:33.105
We're not gonna win
New Hampshire.

12:33.173 --> 12:34.873
What are you talking about?
The polls have us up by...

12:34.941 --> 12:37.608
story's coming out
in the morning paper, 6:00 A.M.

12:37.676 --> 12:39.044
They'll be reading about it
over their damn coffee,

12:39.111 --> 12:40.278
right before they vote.

12:40.346 --> 12:41.646
What story?
What's coming out?

12:41.714 --> 12:43.581
Mellie's having an affair.

12:50.756 --> 12:52.256
<i>Senator Sally Langston won</i>

12:52.324 --> 12:53.591
<i>the New Hampshire</i>
<i>republican primary Tuesday,</i>

12:53.659 --> 12:55.159
<i>with 98% of the precincts</i>
<i>reporting.</i>

12:55.227 --> 12:57.594
<i>Most attribute</i>
<i>the voters' change of heart</i>

12:57.662 --> 12:59.864
<i>to new allegations</i>
<i>that governor grant's wife</i>

12:59.931 --> 13:02.566
<i>is involved</i>
<i>in an extramarital affair.</i>

13:02.633 --> 13:04.601
Now you can't blame this one
on me.

13:04.669 --> 13:06.536
You did a hell of a job
with those two.

13:06.604 --> 13:08.605
The thing is, this isn't a story
that goes away.

13:08.673 --> 13:10.007
You know, you can't spin
a dead marriage.

13:10.075 --> 13:11.607
Sally and Doug,
on the other hand... they're like

13:11.675 --> 13:14.210
a couple of teenagers who can't
keep their hands off each other.

13:14.278 --> 13:15.745
It's kinda gross, actually.

13:15.812 --> 13:17.480
Billy chambers.
Thanks for meeting me, Olivia.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.814
What do you want?

13:18.883 --> 13:20.250
Concede before South Carolina,

13:20.317 --> 13:22.518
and we'll give you
the V.P. slot.

13:22.586 --> 13:24.287
I'll take my check.

13:24.355 --> 13:26.889
Come on. You and I
on the same team?

13:26.956 --> 13:29.824
We'd be unstoppable. We could
play the spin machine,

13:29.893 --> 13:31.693
wrangle reporters,
have nice meals on the trail.

13:31.761 --> 13:33.028
Do you like barbecue?

13:33.096 --> 13:35.030
Are you asking me to concede
or out on a date?

13:35.098 --> 13:36.064
Maybe a little bit of both.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.834
I hate barbecue.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.336
You're awfully confident

13:41.404 --> 13:42.504
for someone who's got
no cards left to play.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.106
Oh, I always have cards
left to play.

13:52.580 --> 13:55.582
This is the man who's
gonna save my campaign?

13:55.650 --> 13:56.850
Governor,
if they look like weapons,

13:56.919 --> 13:58.152
they're hard to keep secret.

13:58.220 --> 14:00.353
You're late.

14:00.421 --> 14:01.754
Blame this guy.

14:01.822 --> 14:04.224
Cyrus, give us a minute.

14:04.292 --> 14:06.659
Huck,

14:06.727 --> 14:09.595
are you ready to reenter
the real world today?

14:11.098 --> 14:12.999
Is he wearing pants?

14:13.067 --> 14:15.167
Paul Mosley...

14:15.235 --> 14:16.535
Literacy policy advisor for...

14:16.602 --> 14:19.004
we all know who he is.
He was advising me on literacy.

14:19.072 --> 14:21.407
But that's it. End of story.
I would never...

14:21.474 --> 14:22.975
honey, it's not necessary.
We believe you.

14:23.043 --> 14:24.709
They were following you.
Did you know that?

14:24.777 --> 14:25.877
What?

14:25.946 --> 14:27.679
A guy like me,
but, like, cleaner,

14:27.747 --> 14:30.782
has been following you
for over seven months...

14:30.850 --> 14:33.151
Taking these photos,
gathering evidence to use against you,

14:33.218 --> 14:34.986
- just waiting for the chance.
-  How'd you get these?

14:35.054 --> 14:37.021
Anything digital,
it's all just out there.

14:37.089 --> 14:39.324
Patterns of ones and zeros
waiting to be gotten.

14:39.391 --> 14:40.925
All these late night meetings...
it doesn't look good.

14:40.993 --> 14:41.892
And the story's
picking up traction

14:41.961 --> 14:43.461
because Mosley's not denying it.

14:43.528 --> 14:45.063
They must be paying him off.

14:45.130 --> 14:47.230
I pulled up all his financials.
His password is "literacy."

14:47.298 --> 14:49.732
What's he got? Swiss accounts?
Cayman Islands?

14:49.800 --> 14:51.034
Uh, just small amounts.

14:51.102 --> 14:54.504
7 cents.
Uh, tiny step productions.

14:54.572 --> 14:57.140
Here's another $4.19.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.775
Hardly damning.
Keep looking.

14:58.843 --> 15:00.810
Well, small payments are interesting, too.
Why is that?

15:00.878 --> 15:02.512
Well, he's been getting
quarterly payments...

15:02.580 --> 15:04.080
From tiny step
productions... tiny ones...

15:04.147 --> 15:06.548
going back 30 years.

15:06.616 --> 15:08.117
You ready to try something new?

15:08.185 --> 15:10.486
I was thinking of going savory,
but what's up?

15:13.223 --> 15:15.591
Excuse me. Hello.

15:15.658 --> 15:17.059
What do you do here?

15:17.127 --> 15:18.060
We're a feature film company.

15:18.128 --> 15:19.227
Oh? What kind of films?

15:19.295 --> 15:21.296
Specialty films, ma'am.

15:21.364 --> 15:24.599
Like educational or...

15:24.666 --> 15:26.267
No way!
No... no way what?

15:26.335 --> 15:28.069
You lost your seat on the bus
when you ran

15:28.137 --> 15:30.472
that Mosley-Mellie affair
nonsense of a story

15:30.539 --> 15:32.007
without even running it by me.

15:32.074 --> 15:33.841
I called for comment.
You didn't pick up.

15:33.909 --> 15:35.742
I expected more from you,
James.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.944
Don't bully me
for doing my job, Cy.

15:38.013 --> 15:39.480
"Times" ran that story, too.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.681
Claire, you're off the bus, too.
Ask James why.

15:41.749 --> 15:43.550
Hey, Liv?
Yeah.

15:43.618 --> 15:45.285
We on top of this, getting this
guy to come clean? I'm on it.

15:45.353 --> 15:46.820
What does that mean, "you're on it"?
I got a guy.

15:46.888 --> 15:48.122
You got a guy? Another guy?

15:48.189 --> 15:50.157
Hells angel? Mobster?

15:50.225 --> 15:52.625
A kind-hearted felon
who owes you a favor?

15:52.692 --> 15:55.561
Technically, he's on probation.

15:55.629 --> 15:58.398
<i>Don't forget</i>
<i>the little pinkie toe.</i>

15:59.733 --> 16:00.833
<i>Mm!</i>

16:00.901 --> 16:02.668
<i>Mwah! Mm!</i>

16:02.736 --> 16:04.803
Toe sucking... not my thing,

16:04.871 --> 16:07.305
but I admire the technique,
no matter the application.

16:07.373 --> 16:09.941
And you, Paul Mosley,

16:10.009 --> 16:12.244
a.k.a.
Brock "The Mouth" stone...

16:12.311 --> 16:14.546
You got mad skills.
You commit.

16:14.613 --> 16:16.114
Get the hell out of my house.
No wonder they made

16:16.182 --> 16:18.150
eight sequels
of "twinkle toes on parade."

16:18.217 --> 16:19.317
I'm calling the cops.
Save your minutes. I already did.

16:19.385 --> 16:20.919
I figured they'd need
a patrol or two

16:20.986 --> 16:22.687
to manage the media circus
that's gonna be tearing up

16:22.755 --> 16:24.888
your front lawn in about...

16:24.956 --> 16:26.290
Four minutes.

16:26.358 --> 16:27.791
You see this,
your toe-sucking highness,

16:27.859 --> 16:29.360
is your golden opportunity

16:29.428 --> 16:31.929
to fervently deny any remotely
romantic involvement

16:31.996 --> 16:34.798
with Mellie grant before
you are a national joke

16:34.866 --> 16:36.500
and the entire
literacy community

16:36.568 --> 16:37.968
that holds you
in such high esteem

16:38.036 --> 16:40.470
reads all about your lengthy
and decorated career

16:40.538 --> 16:42.439
as an artist of toe-rotica.
Wow!

16:42.506 --> 16:45.208
Can I get an amen, Paul?

16:45.276 --> 16:47.143
We have the technology.

16:47.211 --> 16:50.213
We should aerial drone the hell
out of our Southern borders

16:50.281 --> 16:53.049
and protect our legal citizens.

16:53.117 --> 16:54.650
Unless, of course,
governor grant wants to open up

16:54.718 --> 16:57.018
his Santa Barbara ranch
for amnesty.

16:58.888 --> 17:00.389
The next question is for you,

17:00.457 --> 17:01.990
governor grant. Your marriage
has received a lot of attention

17:02.058 --> 17:03.792
during this primary campaign.

17:03.859 --> 17:06.328
And while allegations of
infidelity have been dismissed,

17:06.396 --> 17:07.762
criticism lingers
amongst voters.

17:07.829 --> 17:09.030
Why do you think that is?

17:09.098 --> 17:10.531
We knew it was coming.

17:10.599 --> 17:13.233
I think that
a lot gets lost in translation

17:13.301 --> 17:15.669
between real life
and packaged news footage.

17:15.737 --> 17:18.439
You can't capture 20 years
of marriage in a... in a snapshot.

17:18.507 --> 17:20.540
You can't capture chemistry
with a photo op.

17:20.608 --> 17:22.276
I know what some people perceive

17:22.344 --> 17:24.877
and what the...
The whispers are,

17:24.945 --> 17:27.214
but...

17:27.281 --> 17:29.616
The most honest thing

17:29.683 --> 17:32.085
that I can tell you about myself
right now, Kendal,

17:32.153 --> 17:34.754
is that...

17:34.822 --> 17:37.090
I'm a man in love

17:37.158 --> 17:39.126
with an incredible woman.

18:37.715 --> 18:39.448
There's the man!

18:39.516 --> 18:41.151
Whoo!
Congratulations!

18:41.218 --> 18:43.486
Congratulations!

18:43.554 --> 18:44.688
Yeah!

18:44.755 --> 18:46.322
Uh-huh!
Whoo!

19:07.656 --> 19:10.158
Hi.
This is gideon Wallace from "the D.C. sun."

19:10.226 --> 19:13.327
We spoke last week about
Amanda Tanner in 3-b.

19:13.394 --> 19:14.661
Yes, I do know what time it is.

19:14.729 --> 19:16.897
Hey, I know it's late, but I...

19:16.965 --> 19:18.265
do you know who's looking
after Amanda's dog?

19:18.333 --> 19:19.700
I think it's a golden retriever.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.202
Do you know who's watching it
for her?

19:21.269 --> 19:23.938
Her boyfriend? Really?

19:24.005 --> 19:25.272
Look at these logs.

19:25.340 --> 19:26.973
This girl is
signing into the White House

19:27.041 --> 19:30.376
at the crack of dawn and signing
out in the wee hours, every day.

19:30.444 --> 19:32.846
You know what I think? I think
work and play overlapped.

19:32.913 --> 19:36.049
Think about it. She never goes
home, so where's she doing it?

19:36.116 --> 19:38.284
The White House, that's where.

19:38.352 --> 19:39.919
Oh, like you wouldn't.

19:39.987 --> 19:41.620
So she was sleeping with
someone in the White House,

19:41.688 --> 19:43.255
as apparently,
any red-blooded American would.

19:43.323 --> 19:45.224
And plus, it's gotta be someone

19:45.291 --> 19:46.992
in the parts of the west wing
she's logging into.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.460
Come on.
That totally narrows it down.

19:48.527 --> 19:50.863
To 57 employees
of the male persuasion.

19:50.930 --> 19:54.366
So the question remains...
who's her baby daddy?

19:55.568 --> 19:57.402
Did you just say "baby daddy"?

19:57.470 --> 19:59.871
I need the latest poll numbers

19:59.938 --> 20:02.073
for Alabama, Arizona, Georgia,
Arkansas, Oklahoma.

20:02.140 --> 20:03.241
I'm on it.

20:03.308 --> 20:04.809
Super Tuesday is coming, people,

20:04.877 --> 20:07.979
and it's gonna kill us
if we don't stay on top of it.

20:09.081 --> 20:10.515
Morning.

20:10.583 --> 20:13.050
Good morning, governor grant.

20:15.053 --> 20:16.987
Did you need something?

20:17.054 --> 20:19.823
No, just...

20:19.891 --> 20:20.858
No.

20:20.925 --> 20:21.892
Good.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.084
I'm married.
I know.

20:49.152 --> 20:50.752
I'm running for president.
I know.

20:50.820 --> 20:52.388
I can't.
I don't want you to.

20:52.455 --> 20:55.323
But... just...

20:55.391 --> 20:57.725
Stand here with me,

20:57.793 --> 21:00.061
for one minute.

21:00.129 --> 21:02.663
Let's not go back in there
or talk or think

21:02.731 --> 21:04.698
or...

21:04.766 --> 21:06.200
For one minute,
we just stand here,

21:06.268 --> 21:07.668
and I'm not the candidate

21:07.736 --> 21:09.037
and you're not
the campaign fixer.

21:09.104 --> 21:11.204
We're just us.

21:11.272 --> 21:12.306
One minute, for one minute.

21:12.373 --> 21:15.175
Just...

21:15.243 --> 21:17.110
Stand here with me.

21:25.586 --> 21:27.453
One minute.

22:02.753 --> 22:04.821
Oh! Liv, there you are.

22:04.889 --> 22:06.390
You've really got to look
at what they have me wearing

22:06.458 --> 22:08.625
at the town hall tonight.
I really think it's too much.

22:23.674 --> 22:25.575
Just got the tracking
polls for super Tuesday.

22:25.643 --> 22:27.176
You're still down with women.

22:27.244 --> 22:29.045
They're for Sally and they're
not changing their mind.

22:29.113 --> 22:31.179
I crushed her in that debate.
The whole country saw it.

22:31.247 --> 22:32.681
It's hard to win over women

22:32.749 --> 22:34.483
when there's a viable
female candidate in the race.

22:34.551 --> 22:36.218
We've been waiting a long time.
So what do we do?

22:36.285 --> 22:37.653
We've got the oppo on her.

22:37.721 --> 22:39.121
Three witnesses all willing
to speak on the record

22:39.188 --> 22:41.089
about snorting coke at a frat
party with Sally Langston,

22:41.157 --> 22:42.791
back when she was just a Tri Delt.
It won't work.

22:42.859 --> 22:45.093
You can't nail Sally Langston
on morality.

22:45.161 --> 22:48.462
Sally found God, Cyrus. Once you
find God, all is forgiven.

22:48.531 --> 22:50.832
That's kind of the point.
No, the point is we can't win without women.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.901
No. You take
the opposition research

22:52.968 --> 22:54.769
and you put it in the garbage.

22:54.837 --> 22:56.203
We're playing the rest
of the game above board,

22:56.271 --> 22:57.238
win or lose.

22:57.305 --> 22:58.640
Okay.

23:03.678 --> 23:06.747
And that's exactly why I think
deregulation is a good thing,

23:06.814 --> 23:08.214
like this pie.

23:08.282 --> 23:09.816
Do y'all really get to eat this
all the time?

23:09.884 --> 23:12.252
'Cause if you do, I'll have to
spend a lot more time down here.

23:13.454 --> 23:15.121
I'm sorry.
I just...

23:15.189 --> 23:17.791
I can't do this anymore.

23:19.225 --> 23:21.293
Mel?

23:21.361 --> 23:24.530
It's okay, honey, I just...
I need to say it.

23:28.969 --> 23:30.970
Um...

23:31.038 --> 23:33.439
A few months ago,

23:33.506 --> 23:35.040
Fitz and I found out

23:35.107 --> 23:38.309
that we were pregnant
with our third child.

23:38.377 --> 23:41.145
And we were so thrilled,
so excited

23:41.213 --> 23:44.716
to bring a new life
into our family.

23:44.784 --> 23:47.518
But...

23:47.587 --> 23:49.955
Campaigns can be so stressful,

23:50.022 --> 23:53.156
and I guess...

23:55.226 --> 23:58.629
I guess my body
just couldn't handle it.

23:58.697 --> 24:01.665
And... I lost our baby.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.968
Even though it was
only eight weeks...

24:04.035 --> 24:06.570
It was a baby

24:06.637 --> 24:10.372
and it was a member
of our family and...

24:10.440 --> 24:14.110
I have grieved
for the loss of our child

24:14.177 --> 24:16.412
every day since.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.616
And I know that many of you
have sensed,

24:19.683 --> 24:21.584
um, I don't know,

24:21.652 --> 24:23.451
distance...

24:23.519 --> 24:26.421
Between me and Fitz
during the campaign,

24:26.489 --> 24:30.525
while we have struggled
through this...

24:30.593 --> 24:33.061
Terrible experience
as best we could.

24:33.129 --> 24:36.832
And I should say...

24:36.899 --> 24:38.500
Fitz wanted to quit

24:38.567 --> 24:43.270
to give us time
to take care of each other,

24:43.338 --> 24:45.106
but I wouldn't let him,

24:45.173 --> 24:49.243
because I truly believe
that he is the best person

24:49.310 --> 24:51.545
to be president
of the United States,

24:51.613 --> 24:55.782
and I couldn't let our loss
stand in the way of that.

25:06.661 --> 25:08.594
I think
that ought to take care of it,

25:08.663 --> 25:09.963
don't you?

25:18.275 --> 25:19.776
Hey, Marco. How's
the night shift treating you?

25:19.844 --> 25:23.579
Cool. Did you get
that coroner's report yet?

25:25.215 --> 25:26.181
Seriously?

25:26.249 --> 25:28.484
How far along?

25:28.552 --> 25:30.386
Hi. Gideon Wallace. "D.C. sun."

25:30.454 --> 25:31.954
Yeah, that's right.
I called before.

25:32.021 --> 25:33.456
No, I didn't know you needed
to be at work in an hour.

25:33.523 --> 25:35.424
Do you know Amanda's boyfriend?
He's... mm-hmm.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.892
Watching her dog...
Works at the White House.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.427
You don't know his name?

25:39.495 --> 25:40.829
Lives in Logan circle.

25:40.896 --> 25:42.731
All right. Thank you.

25:44.633 --> 25:47.969
Old. Old. Ugly. Psycho eyes.

25:48.036 --> 25:50.572
Ugly. Old. Old.

25:50.639 --> 25:52.740
I have learned so much tonight.

25:52.807 --> 25:53.807
What about this guy?

25:53.875 --> 25:55.476
Robert Sullivan,
deputy assistant

25:55.543 --> 25:57.578
to the president for homeland security.
Why him?

25:57.645 --> 25:59.380
He's cute.
But look at that smile.

25:59.447 --> 26:01.214
He could totally be a killer.
You think whoever knocked her up

26:01.282 --> 26:02.583
was also the one
who killed her?

26:02.650 --> 26:04.251
Of course.
It's always the boyfriend.

26:04.318 --> 26:05.786
Of course.

26:39.018 --> 26:43.020
I was sorry to hear
about your loss.

26:43.087 --> 26:45.623
Are you...

26:45.690 --> 26:47.858
Is Mellie okay?

26:47.926 --> 26:50.160
If she needs to take a break
from the campaign,

26:50.228 --> 26:51.762
I'm sure we could...

26:51.830 --> 26:53.731
Mellie's fine.

26:53.799 --> 26:56.666
She flew to Alabama. She's doing
12 campaign stops in 2 days.

26:56.734 --> 26:59.669
She's thrilled.

26:59.737 --> 27:02.705
Nothing keeps that woman down,

27:02.773 --> 27:04.507
not even a fake miscarriage.

27:09.814 --> 27:13.048
She's a real catch, my wife.

27:13.115 --> 27:14.716
I'm a lucky man.

27:14.784 --> 27:16.384
I'm sorry.

27:16.453 --> 27:19.254
God. Please don't.
Don't be nice to me.

27:19.322 --> 27:21.323
I'm sitting here complaining
to you about my wife,

27:21.390 --> 27:23.925
which is sleazy and low
and not fair to you

27:23.993 --> 27:25.193
and the oldest trick
in the book.

27:27.930 --> 27:29.597
Suddenly I'm looking down
at myself

27:29.665 --> 27:32.467
and I'm...

27:32.534 --> 27:34.302
How did I get here?

27:36.571 --> 27:39.739
Why didn't I meet you sooner?

27:39.807 --> 27:42.076
What kind of a coward was I
to marry her

27:42.143 --> 27:45.079
and not wait for you
to show up?

27:53.420 --> 27:54.787
Governor grant...

27:54.855 --> 27:56.122
oh, for God sake,

27:56.190 --> 27:59.859
we are so far beyond
the "governor grant" crap.

27:59.926 --> 28:01.394
Just say my name.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.896
That's crossing the line.
It would be inappropriate.

28:03.964 --> 28:06.799
Then let's be inappropriate.

28:14.340 --> 28:15.740
Say my name.

28:39.731 --> 28:41.331
Fitz.

29:12.461 --> 29:16.330
This is me. How early are
we starting tomorrow?

29:16.398 --> 29:18.199
6:00 A.M. pancake breakfast
at the baptist church

29:18.267 --> 29:19.733
and a prayer meeting.

29:19.801 --> 29:22.636
I can already feel the holy
water burning my pagan flesh.

29:22.704 --> 29:23.971
Night.

29:24.039 --> 29:25.273
Night.
Good night.

29:33.948 --> 29:36.316
This is me.

29:36.384 --> 29:38.017
I'm down there.

29:45.192 --> 29:47.859
Just go in your room
and close the door,

29:47.927 --> 29:50.196
and we'll pretend
this never happened.

29:56.470 --> 29:58.404
Go in your room.

30:57.694 --> 30:59.028
Take off your clothes.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.870
Yeah, I think I got something.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.404
Some woman.

32:21.472 --> 32:23.207
Nah, you can't tell who it is.

32:23.274 --> 32:26.008
They're not exactly talking.

32:26.076 --> 32:29.545
Yep. I'll send it your way.

32:49.598 --> 32:51.399
This goes to your boss.

33:11.719 --> 33:13.987
Sorry to interrupt.

33:14.054 --> 33:15.454
This just came for you.

33:15.522 --> 33:17.290
Thank you.

33:17.357 --> 33:18.658
I'm sorry.
What's your name again?

33:18.725 --> 33:20.226
There's so many new people
around here,

33:20.294 --> 33:21.661
I keep losing track.

33:21.728 --> 33:23.629
Amanda. Tanner.
And please, no worries.

33:23.697 --> 33:26.565
I'm just happy to be here. I'm
a huge fan of senator Langston.

33:26.633 --> 33:27.934
Amanda.

33:28.002 --> 33:29.401
I won't forget this time.

33:29.468 --> 33:30.602
I promise.

34:11.543 --> 34:13.744
<i>Take off your clothes.</i>

34:17.081 --> 34:19.382
Cyrus got this?
In the mail?

34:19.449 --> 34:22.184
Someone's had this
for two years.

34:22.252 --> 34:23.918
Why wait? Why now?

34:23.987 --> 34:25.788
All they had was
a tape and a voice.

34:25.856 --> 34:27.456
They needed the voice.

34:27.524 --> 34:29.190
They needed a girl.

34:29.259 --> 34:32.261
They needed Amanda Tanner.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.851
If the baby's blood type is A,
and Amanda's is B,

34:43.918 --> 34:45.953
then the father has to be
either type A or type AB.

34:46.021 --> 34:47.388
We could subpoena

34:47.455 --> 34:49.523
the White House personnel files
for the blood types.

34:49.591 --> 34:51.458
Alissa, we don't have enough
to subpoena anyone for anything.

34:51.525 --> 34:53.728
But we are so close.

34:53.795 --> 34:54.929
We're not close.

34:54.996 --> 34:56.862
We have a suicide and a hunch.
Go home.

34:56.931 --> 34:58.331
What?
Get some sleep.

34:58.399 --> 35:00.567
Study for the bar.
Go shoe shopping.

35:00.634 --> 35:03.136
Sorry I kept you up all night
on a wild... nothing.

35:03.204 --> 35:04.171
David?

35:04.238 --> 35:05.138
Yeah?

35:05.206 --> 35:07.808
I'm not.

35:13.714 --> 35:14.847
Good night.

35:14.915 --> 35:16.215
Night.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.818
Hi. Uh, this is gideon Wallace
with "the D.C. sun."

35:18.885 --> 35:21.319
I'd like to speak to
chief of staff chambers, please.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.757
Oh, you answer your own phone.
Cool.

35:25.825 --> 35:28.292
Uh, I'm calling to get a quote for a
story I'm working on.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.462
I'm gonna run out
and grab some bagels.

35:31.530 --> 35:32.831
Right.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.535
Okay.

35:38.603 --> 35:41.138
Well, it's about your
relationship with Amanda Tanner.

35:42.506 --> 35:43.707
Thank you, governor.

35:46.477 --> 35:47.745
Billy.

35:47.812 --> 35:48.879
Don't thank me
until you hear it.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.413
That was governor grant.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.982
I've just accepted his offer
to be his V.P.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.884
Billy, we were creamed
on super Tuesday.

35:54.952 --> 35:56.452
We are out of options.

35:56.519 --> 35:58.621
So what, we just...
no. No.

35:58.688 --> 35:59.956
He is a philandering
faux conservative

36:00.023 --> 36:01.490
who will destroy everything,

36:01.558 --> 36:04.326
every single thing that we have
promised to millions of people,

36:04.394 --> 36:06.462
honest Americans.
What are we gonna say to them?

36:06.529 --> 36:08.529
Tell 'em to vote.
Vote grant-Langston.

36:08.597 --> 36:10.031
This makes super Tuesday
nothing,

36:10.099 --> 36:11.967
a blip. Just listen.
All right, not for me,

36:12.034 --> 36:13.769
but for the future
of our country.

36:13.836 --> 36:15.103
<i>Matthew</i> 13:24.

36:15.171 --> 36:17.072
There's a parable about
a group of enemies

36:17.140 --> 36:19.307
who plant bad seeds amongst
the good ones to ruin the crops.

36:19.375 --> 36:21.977
The farmer notices weeds
growing amongst the fruit.

36:22.044 --> 36:23.578
The servants ask the farmer
if they should round up

36:23.646 --> 36:25.913
the weeds before the harvest,
and what does the farmer say?

36:25.981 --> 36:27.414
"No. Let them grow together."

36:27.482 --> 36:31.018
One day, God will burn the weeds
and save the fruit, Billy,

36:31.086 --> 36:34.021
but for now, let 'em grow.

37:00.613 --> 37:02.614
You need to get back
to the White House

37:02.682 --> 37:04.249
before the press corps
comes in.

37:04.317 --> 37:06.518
Mm.

37:13.158 --> 37:15.359
I've imagined your place
a thousand times.

37:15.427 --> 37:17.594
I like it.

37:17.662 --> 37:19.430
It's very you.

37:19.497 --> 37:23.367
Yeah.
Living alone has its perks.

37:28.605 --> 37:29.973
I should go.

37:30.041 --> 37:31.808
You should go.

37:39.717 --> 37:40.884
One minute?

37:44.755 --> 37:46.556
Yeah. One minute.

39:36.561 --> 39:38.727
Good-bye, Livvie.

39:42.266 --> 39:44.934
Good-bye, Mr. president.

40:04.220 --> 40:07.289
Amanda Tanner worked
<i>in</i> the west wing with you.

40:07.357 --> 40:09.023
There's pictures
of the two of you

40:09.091 --> 40:10.524
including several with her dog.

40:10.592 --> 40:12.293
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.
Can we just get right

40:12.361 --> 40:13.995
to the point here, gideon?
What are you saying exactly?

40:14.062 --> 40:15.662
I think you had
a relationship with Amanda.

40:15.730 --> 40:17.198
I think you were her boyfriend.

40:21.636 --> 40:24.605
Is that it?
Is that your big discovery,

40:24.672 --> 40:26.406
that we were
boyfriend and girlfriend?

40:26.474 --> 40:28.674
That we held hands?
Went steady?

40:28.742 --> 40:30.143
If I were the vice president's
chief of staff,

40:30.211 --> 40:31.978
that's not something that
I would want people to know,

40:32.046 --> 40:34.014
especially considering
that she... morons.

40:34.081 --> 40:35.548
What?

40:35.616 --> 40:38.418
I'm surrounded by morons.
Huge, clueless morons.

40:38.486 --> 40:39.785
I've got a story here.

40:39.853 --> 40:42.988
Yeah, genius, you do,
only it's the wrong one.

40:43.056 --> 40:44.990
I'm not the story.
The president's the story.

40:45.058 --> 40:46.958
The president is the one
who slept with Amanda Tanner.

40:47.027 --> 40:48.793
I was your source
in the White House.

40:48.861 --> 40:50.295
I sent you the pictures

40:50.363 --> 40:51.863
of Amanda and the president
and the stupid dog.

40:51.931 --> 40:53.399
I sent you the west wing logs.

40:53.466 --> 40:55.467
She visited him
practically every day.

40:55.535 --> 40:58.569
Dear God, man, I did everything
except draw you a picture

40:58.637 --> 41:00.938
of their figures doing it!

41:01.006 --> 41:03.274
All you had to do was
put two and two together.

41:03.342 --> 41:05.209
What is it with people?

41:05.277 --> 41:07.445
Why are they
so freaking stupid?!

41:07.513 --> 41:10.314
You, Amanda. It was
an easy script for both of you.

41:10.382 --> 41:12.083
Big letters, small words.

41:12.151 --> 41:14.217
You could... you could follow it
in your sleep.

41:14.285 --> 41:18.321
Oh, my God. You sent her in
to sleep with the president.

41:18.389 --> 41:20.857
"Oh, my God."

41:20.925 --> 41:22.959
You call yourself a journalist?
You're a joke.

41:23.027 --> 41:24.761
You could have been
the next woodward and Bernstein

41:24.828 --> 41:26.396
and the best you can do is
tell everyone

41:26.464 --> 41:28.698
that I had a relationship
with a crazy dead girl?

41:28.766 --> 41:30.599
Good luck with that story.

41:30.667 --> 41:32.134
That's not all I came up with.

41:32.202 --> 41:33.735
You're an idiot.

41:33.803 --> 41:35.271
Whatever you say,
I'll just deny it.

41:35.338 --> 41:36.972
This conversation
never happened.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.507
According to
the coroner's report,

41:38.575 --> 41:41.043
Amanda was 13 weeks pregnant.
I bet it's your baby.

41:41.111 --> 41:43.946
I may be a joke,
but "dead White House intern

41:44.013 --> 41:45.580
was carrying V.P. aide's
love child"...

41:45.647 --> 41:47.215
that sure sounds like
a story to me.

41:47.283 --> 41:49.684
I even have a copy
of the coroner's report

41:49.751 --> 41:50.985
if you want to see it.
Gotta believe they can run

41:51.053 --> 41:53.054
a D.N.A. match between you
and a fetus.

41:53.122 --> 41:55.523
This conversation
might be easy to deny,

41:55.591 --> 41:57.592
but that sure as hell
wouldn't be, would it?

41:57.659 --> 41:59.327
Let me just see
where I put that.

41:59.395 --> 42:00.295
I'll show you.

42:02.730 --> 42:05.665
Aah!

42:11.072 --> 42:12.606
It is my honor

42:12.673 --> 42:14.975
to have senator Langston's
conviction

42:15.042 --> 42:17.610
and strong sense of justice
by my side.

42:17.677 --> 42:19.412
And with your support,

42:19.480 --> 42:21.547
we are gonna take
the White House in November

42:21.615 --> 42:23.149
and we are gonna bring America

42:23.217 --> 42:24.683
the change
it's been waiting for!

42:26.620 --> 42:30.456
Whoo!
