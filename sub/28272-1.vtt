00:55.577 --> 01:00.347
I'm so sorry, this is the
story of Charlotte and Brandon,

01:00.349 --> 01:02.349
they love my TV show.

01:02.351 --> 01:05.686
Oatmeal, exercise,
well, sort of.

01:05.688 --> 01:08.122
They both hate sleeping alone.

01:08.124 --> 01:10.558
Beer and hairy nipples.

01:10.560 --> 01:13.494
The good news is they
are a perfect match.

01:13.496 --> 01:15.563
The bad news is,
they have never met.

01:15.565 --> 01:19.968
And Charlotte is with Steven
while Brandon is with Ashley.

01:26.108 --> 01:26.976
Oh, um.

01:28.377 --> 01:30.377
Well, I can't marry you

01:30.379 --> 01:33.214
because I'm marrying
someone else in May.

01:33.216 --> 01:35.483
You don't even
have a boyfriend.

01:35.485 --> 01:37.753
Well, actually I do.

01:38.387 --> 01:41.222
We've been together since
high school, for 14 years.

01:41.224 --> 01:43.123
It's just that he's been
living very far away

01:43.125 --> 01:45.759
and now, he's moving back
so we can be together.

01:45.761 --> 01:47.428
14 years?

01:47.430 --> 01:49.531
Sounds like commitment issues.

01:49.533 --> 01:51.199
No, it's just
that he was waiting

01:51.201 --> 01:53.635
until we were both ready.

01:53.637 --> 01:55.637
Why am I defending
myself to a first grader?

01:55.639 --> 01:58.174
Well, when it all falls apart,
you know where to find me.

01:59.175 --> 02:01.409
Look, Lance, we've
done all the graphics

02:01.411 --> 02:05.446
for your packaging and prints
ads at very reasonable rates.

02:05.448 --> 02:08.717
We've created the signature
look for Be Yourself Cosmetics.

02:08.719 --> 02:12.387
Now, it's great that your
nephew's a whiz at Photoshop

02:12.389 --> 02:13.756
but believe me,
there's just so much...

02:13.758 --> 02:15.290
Screw you, Lance!

02:15.292 --> 02:17.359
And your oxymoronically
named product

02:17.361 --> 02:19.730
and your muttonheaded
fucktard nephew!

02:21.231 --> 02:22.664
Christ, are you off your meds?

02:22.666 --> 02:24.132
That's our biggest account!

02:24.134 --> 02:26.735
He's an asshole,
Brandon, asshole.

02:26.737 --> 02:29.170
Bro, I went to RISD
with Seth MacFarlane,

02:29.172 --> 02:30.674
I don't need that shit!

02:31.642 --> 02:33.508
That asshole was paying
off my student loans.

02:33.510 --> 02:35.710
Yeah, and our bills.

02:35.712 --> 02:36.581
Shit!

02:38.416 --> 02:41.450
You think you can get
him back on the phone?

02:41.452 --> 02:43.353
I'm still
here you broke bitches.

02:57.734 --> 02:58.733
For you.

02:58.735 --> 02:59.668
Thank you.

02:59.670 --> 03:00.636
My pleasure.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.705
You're a
pretty decent drawer.

03:02.707 --> 03:03.741
Thank you.

03:05.710 --> 03:09.378
You know, I've been called
the Vermeer of napkin art.

03:09.380 --> 03:10.248
Who?

03:11.549 --> 03:14.317
Did I leave my amethyst
necklace at your place?

03:14.319 --> 03:16.318
Yeah, yeah, think I
saw it in the bathroom.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.788
Okay, remind me to
get that from you.

03:18.790 --> 03:21.557
So, my boss gave us free tickets

03:21.559 --> 03:23.693
to the Charger's game Sunday.

03:23.695 --> 03:24.563
Wanna go?

03:26.564 --> 03:28.433
The 405 on a Sunday?

03:32.670 --> 03:34.305
Okay, I'll drive.

03:35.473 --> 03:37.707
Yeah, you know I'm not
really into drunk crowds

03:37.709 --> 03:40.545
and football, or people.

03:40.778 --> 03:41.911
Of course.

03:41.913 --> 03:43.746
What's that mean?

03:43.748 --> 03:46.649
You know, I have dated
guys with commitment issues.

03:46.651 --> 03:47.617
Lot's of them.

03:47.619 --> 03:48.719
Pretty standard stuff, but you,

03:48.721 --> 03:51.588
I can't even get you to
commit to a football game.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.255
Well, I don't like football.

03:53.257 --> 03:54.891
It's not that,
it's everything.

03:54.893 --> 03:55.892
You won't go to Coachella.

03:55.894 --> 03:57.628
You won't move in together

03:57.630 --> 03:58.562
because that would
be moving too fast.

03:58.564 --> 04:00.931
You won't even book
that cruise next summer

04:00.933 --> 04:03.532
because a lot can
happen in six months!

04:03.534 --> 04:05.301
Those tickets
are non-refundable.

04:05.303 --> 04:07.470
And you're a cheapskate!

04:07.472 --> 04:08.772
Which is why I thought
you'd like the free tickets

04:08.774 --> 04:09.973
in the first place!

04:09.975 --> 04:11.474
I'm not cheap,
my money's tied up.

04:11.476 --> 04:12.743
And I can't go to the game

04:12.745 --> 04:15.579
because I wanna start training
for that Rwanda charity ride.

04:15.581 --> 04:17.214
You know, where
people are dying.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.616
Yeah, like that's
gonna happen.

04:19.618 --> 04:20.853
Ashley, Ashley.

04:22.388 --> 04:24.721
Okay, you're right.

04:24.723 --> 04:25.591
I'm sorry.

04:26.725 --> 04:30.927
Let's do it Ashley, you and
me, Coachella next year.

04:30.929 --> 04:31.895
Ugh!

04:31.897 --> 04:33.664
Oh, my god.

04:33.666 --> 04:35.565
You have to see this house.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.902
It has an entertainment room
that would be so perfect

04:37.904 --> 04:39.537
for you to have
your buddies over

04:39.539 --> 04:41.505
so you can watch your
football matches, and then...

04:41.507 --> 04:43.607
It's games, it's not matches.

04:43.609 --> 04:45.910
Uhm, anyway, there's
a chef's kitchen,

04:45.912 --> 04:47.678
newly remodeled bathrooms,

04:47.680 --> 04:51.883
there's a study that would
make a perfect nursery.

04:51.885 --> 04:55.585
I think maybe we should
hold off on the house.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.653
Why?

04:56.655 --> 05:00.758
I just got here, you
know, starting a new job.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.460
There's a lot to figure out.

05:02.462 --> 05:05.732
You don't have to
figure us out, right?

05:07.701 --> 05:09.534
You do?

05:09.536 --> 05:11.301
Now, Charlotte,
just wait a minute.

05:11.303 --> 05:13.303
No, no, no no, no,
I am not waiting.

05:13.305 --> 05:15.673
I waited through college,
through med school

05:15.675 --> 05:16.641
and through your residency.

05:16.643 --> 05:18.341
That was the plan.

05:18.343 --> 05:20.645
I know, I know, and
you've been so great

05:20.647 --> 05:21.679
through all of that.

05:21.681 --> 05:22.612
Is there someone else?

05:22.614 --> 05:24.016
Is it that Nurse Newcombe?

05:24.018 --> 05:25.616
No, no way.

05:25.618 --> 05:26.752
Well, then what is it?

05:26.754 --> 05:28.621
It's just, you,

05:30.024 --> 05:31.723
so predictable.

05:31.725 --> 05:33.725
Wha, wha, wha, what the heck
does that mean?

05:33.727 --> 05:36.728
Up every morning at 6:00 a.m.,
the same Honey Nut Oatmeal,

05:36.730 --> 05:39.330
you're off to work, back home,
then in bed at 10 o'clock.

05:39.332 --> 05:40.698
You don't follow sports.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.700
Sex, missionary position
with the lights off.

05:42.702 --> 05:44.502
There's no surprises.

05:44.504 --> 05:46.871
I'm bored out of my mind.

05:46.873 --> 05:50.542
Well, I didn't know it
was so horrible for you.

05:50.544 --> 05:53.779
Well that explains the
engagement ring,

05:53.781 --> 05:57.950
the promise ring and the
pre-promise ring.

05:57.952 --> 06:01.254
14 years, Steven!

06:01.554 --> 06:05.356
In hindsight, I probably
should have done this sooner.

06:05.358 --> 06:07.391
Did you bring me up here
so I wouldn't make a scene?

06:07.393 --> 06:08.459
Because I am gonna make a scene.

06:08.461 --> 06:09.827
I'm gonna tell
everybody in town.

06:09.829 --> 06:10.762
I'm gonna announce
it in church...

06:10.764 --> 06:11.897
Charlotte,

06:11.899 --> 06:13.632
- would you please just...
- I'm gonna put posters up...

06:13.634 --> 06:14.867
Hey, calm down
and hydrate, please.

06:14.869 --> 06:18.637
Don't you tell me to
hydrate, you jackass!

06:26.547 --> 06:28.314
Steven, are you okay?

06:29.984 --> 06:31.817
Fuck no!

06:31.819 --> 06:33.752
We find the
defendant, Charlotte Wells,

06:33.754 --> 06:36.923
guilty of criminal
assault and battery.

06:36.925 --> 06:39.391
If you complete
community service,

06:39.393 --> 06:42.361
anger management
classes and probation,

06:42.363 --> 06:44.663
the felony charge
will be expunged.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.035
Sentence is 30 days in jail.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.405
Don't tell me how
to live my life.

06:53.407 --> 06:54.873
Yes sir, motherfucker.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.677
Goddamn fucking shit.

06:59.113 --> 07:03.082
I gotta do me, fuck all y'all
if you can't appreciate!

07:03.084 --> 07:03.952
Step off!

07:05.420 --> 07:07.120
Who do you think you
are, Princess Elsa?

07:07.122 --> 07:09.656
It's not goddamn Arendelle.

07:09.658 --> 07:10.926
Skinny ass bitch!

07:34.449 --> 07:35.016
Ash?

07:35.817 --> 07:36.685
Ashley?

07:40.188 --> 07:41.756
Oh, yeah

07:45.093 --> 07:46.127
Give it baby

07:48.931 --> 07:52.066
That's what I'm
talking about, baby

07:52.068 --> 07:54.068
Ow, ow, hot, hot, hot.

07:54.070 --> 07:55.803
I'm on fire.

07:55.805 --> 07:56.672
Oh, yeah.

08:00.776 --> 08:04.711
Somebody's
earning their lunch money.

08:04.713 --> 08:05.780
Oh, yeah.

08:11.954 --> 08:13.621
Jesus, Brandon,
what can I say?

08:13.623 --> 08:16.857
She's a treacherous whore,
you're better off without her.

08:16.859 --> 08:18.759
You're gonna give
yourself a heart attack.

08:18.761 --> 08:19.996
What've you gone,

08:21.130 --> 08:22.062
a mile and a half?

08:22.064 --> 08:24.632
Shit, you're in terrible shape.

08:24.634 --> 08:28.535
I bought this bike
so that I could get fit

08:28.537 --> 08:30.738
and do the Rwanda ride.

08:30.740 --> 08:32.640
You ever seen me on it?

08:32.642 --> 08:34.073
No.

08:34.076 --> 08:35.644
The whore's right, Dan.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.544
I can't commit to
anything, especially women.

08:38.547 --> 08:40.714
Which explains why
I've had 50 girlfriends

08:40.716 --> 08:43.051
in the past 10 years.

08:43.053 --> 08:45.721
I can get 'em but
I can't keep 'em.

08:46.555 --> 08:48.589
I want a lasting love, Dan.

08:48.591 --> 08:49.492
I wanna be married.

08:50.526 --> 08:53.094
You have had a run of
lousy luck with women.

08:53.096 --> 08:55.095
Luck has nothing to
do with it, it's me.

08:55.097 --> 08:56.597
It has to be me.

08:56.599 --> 08:58.098
I have to change, Dan.

08:58.100 --> 09:01.438
Come on champ, you stink,
let's go get a shower.

09:09.179 --> 09:09.744
Welcome home, girl.

09:09.746 --> 09:12.280
Oh my god!

09:12.282 --> 09:13.580
Ow!

09:13.582 --> 09:15.516
- Oh, my god.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow ow ow!

09:15.518 --> 09:16.952
I'm so sorry.

09:16.954 --> 09:19.753
Carly, I'm so sorry,
it's my prison reflexes.

09:19.755 --> 09:20.721
Fuck that hurt!

09:20.723 --> 09:22.960
Oh my god, you are so strong.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.163
Is it sick that I envy you?

09:27.165 --> 09:28.997
You're an ass kicker now.

09:28.999 --> 09:31.300
You look great,
you've lost weight.

09:31.302 --> 09:32.368
Man, I wanna go to jail.

09:32.370 --> 09:36.604
Oh yeah, everybody
should, and it's so simple.

09:36.606 --> 09:37.973
All you have to do is
spend half your life

09:37.975 --> 09:41.042
in a disastrous relationship
and commit a felony.

09:41.044 --> 09:43.278
Okay, none of
which was your fault.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.647
It was all my fault.

09:45.649 --> 09:49.151
Look, okay, I read online
that the average woman

09:49.153 --> 09:50.686
will have four serious
relationship before she gets

09:50.688 --> 09:52.587
married. So, at the
rate you're going,

09:52.589 --> 09:54.689
you're not gonna get
married till like you're 84.

09:54.691 --> 09:56.759
You need to get right
back on the horse.

09:56.761 --> 09:58.060
How?

09:58.062 --> 10:00.096
I have nothing to offer.

10:00.098 --> 10:02.198
Men just want some spontaneous,

10:02.200 --> 10:04.634
unpredictable sexual deviant.

10:05.069 --> 10:06.701
Girl, you're giving
men too much credit.

10:06.703 --> 10:07.969
They're simple beasts.

10:07.971 --> 10:10.772
All's they crave is
sex, sports, beer, food

10:10.774 --> 10:12.342
and sometimes a little anal.

10:12.344 --> 10:13.176
Really?

10:13.178 --> 10:13.843
Really.

10:13.845 --> 10:14.710
Really?

10:14.712 --> 10:16.245
Really.

10:16.247 --> 10:18.781
Okay, if that's what men want,

10:18.783 --> 10:20.950
then that is what
I'm gonna give them.

10:20.952 --> 10:23.686
Except that last part,
not gonna happen.

10:23.688 --> 10:24.854
SCHWEITZER POLIZEI
FRAU: Yeah, yeah,

10:24.856 --> 10:27.089
we've all seen the
makeover sequence

10:27.091 --> 10:28.960
so I won't bore you with it.

10:51.949 --> 10:54.717
Kapernick, Manning,
Brees, cradle the balls!

10:54.719 --> 10:55.818
Work the shaft!

10:55.820 --> 10:56.952
Yes!

10:56.954 --> 10:59.155
You are now an expert on men.

10:59.157 --> 11:01.658
All right, this is all
the shit that he gave you

11:01.660 --> 11:03.393
over the last 14 years.

11:03.395 --> 11:05.798
Throw away, sell online and,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.333
whatever the fuck this is.

11:10.335 --> 11:12.701
Yeah, he got it at an
Infectious Diseases Conference

11:12.703 --> 11:14.137
in Shanghai.

11:14.139 --> 11:15.773
I kinda like it.

11:18.243 --> 11:20.045
It's going.

11:20.845 --> 11:22.247
Yeah, this is disgusting.

11:37.663 --> 11:38.363
Hmm.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.494
Wow, so you're a
graphic designer,

13:15.496 --> 13:17.231
you must be really artistic.

13:17.830 --> 13:21.500
Well, I have been called
the Vermeer of napkin art.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.872
Wait, what are you watching?

13:26.874 --> 13:29.210
Oh, it's this, this silly show

13:30.545 --> 13:32.878
about this Swiss
police woman who is...

13:32.880 --> 13:34.146
Schweizer Polizei Frau?

13:34.148 --> 13:35.380
You know it?

13:35.382 --> 13:36.381
Ja!

13:39.820 --> 13:42.888
I binge-watched all seven
seasons in like six days.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.223
Yeah, I'm on season four.

13:44.225 --> 13:46.825
Oh, there's great
ones coming up.

13:46.827 --> 13:50.829
We talked last
night for four hours.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.999
I think he's a really nice guy.

13:53.001 --> 13:53.967
Oh.

13:53.969 --> 13:55.867
Do you think I should
tell him about Steven?

13:55.869 --> 13:58.837
If you never wanna
hear from him again.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.940
Dating one guy your whole
life might come off a little...

14:01.942 --> 14:02.908
- Sad?
- Freakish.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.077
Like you were raised on
a polygamist compound.

14:05.079 --> 14:07.480
Don't show him the
woman you were,

14:07.482 --> 14:10.418
show him the woman
you're going to be.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.252
You mean lie?

14:12.254 --> 14:13.886
Hell yes, lie.

14:13.888 --> 14:16.856
Don't tell her you have
56K in student loans.

14:16.858 --> 14:18.524
Tell her you have
a 10 inch schlong

14:18.526 --> 14:21.060
and you're the heir
to Walmart fortune.

14:21.062 --> 14:21.928
It's the internet.

14:21.930 --> 14:23.498
If you're not lying,
your not trying.

14:24.833 --> 14:25.800
Hey, hey!

14:27.535 --> 14:29.835
My last boyfriend? Uh...

14:29.837 --> 14:35.242
Let's see, I was with
him for 14 months.

14:35.244 --> 14:38.612
Wow, so brief.

14:38.614 --> 14:41.515
Well, how long do your
relationships only last for?

14:41.517 --> 14:44.551
Uh, you know, two,

14:44.553 --> 14:45.552
three years.

14:45.554 --> 14:47.987
So, you haven't been
with that many women.

14:47.989 --> 14:49.889
A handful.

14:49.891 --> 14:53.893
You know, for me, it's more
about quality than quantity.

14:53.895 --> 14:55.395
My biggest fault?

14:55.397 --> 14:57.930
Sometimes, I give
too much, you know,

14:57.932 --> 14:59.533
whether it's work
or relationships.

14:59.535 --> 15:03.337
I'm all in, kind of a warp
speed ahead kinda guy.

15:03.339 --> 15:06.073
And sometimes, I'm so
spontaneous and unpredictable

15:06.075 --> 15:07.541
that people find it exhausting.

15:07.543 --> 15:09.278
But I'm working on that.

15:10.012 --> 15:11.478
I mean maybe 'cause I'm country

15:11.480 --> 15:14.581
but there's nothing like
a cold brewski, right?

15:14.583 --> 15:16.015
Hell yeah.

15:16.017 --> 15:17.418
Steelers baby!

15:17.420 --> 15:19.219
Big Ben is my boy.

15:19.221 --> 15:22.558
The San Diego Super Chargers!

15:23.527 --> 15:25.360
Well, you're looking
at the two-time

15:25.362 --> 15:27.997
salsa dancing champion
of West Virginia.

15:30.534 --> 15:33.167
Look, I'm not saying I'm
Lance Armstrong or anything,

15:33.169 --> 15:35.002
I'm kinda on the
level just below him,

15:35.004 --> 15:37.071
but cycling is my passion.

15:37.073 --> 15:39.206
God, you're food
looks amazing,

15:39.208 --> 15:40.974
where did you learn to cook?

15:40.976 --> 15:41.842
Oh please, look at you,

15:41.844 --> 15:43.346
making your own
pasta from scratch?

15:45.281 --> 15:46.613
You have beautiful eyes.

15:46.615 --> 15:49.019
You have a very sexy smile.

15:49.686 --> 15:50.951
Salut.

15:50.953 --> 15:52.155
Saluts.

15:52.556 --> 15:54.089
Oh, oh, god!

15:54.091 --> 15:55.690
Hey.

15:55.692 --> 15:56.358
Ah, no, no!

15:56.360 --> 15:57.459
No, it's not what you think.

15:57.461 --> 16:01.629
I just, I didn't have
time to get dressed before...

16:01.631 --> 16:01.997
Me too.

16:05.935 --> 16:07.067
I want you.

16:07.069 --> 16:08.302
Come to LA.

16:08.304 --> 16:10.003
I'll pay for the ticket.

16:10.005 --> 16:12.641
Look, I want to so bad,
but I looked into tickets,

16:12.643 --> 16:14.976
they are $700.

16:14.978 --> 16:16.311
Or we could split it,

16:16.313 --> 16:18.714
if it feels like I
coming on too strong.

16:18.716 --> 16:22.519
This is gonna be so amazing!

16:22.719 --> 16:24.686
Oh my god, I can't
believe I'm here.

16:24.688 --> 16:26.388
I can't
believe you're here.

16:26.390 --> 16:28.723
Oh, I
love your car.

16:28.725 --> 16:29.691
Thanks.

16:39.470 --> 16:42.505
So that's the Getty
Villa, right there.

16:42.507 --> 16:44.272
J. Paul Getty was the
world's richest man

16:44.274 --> 16:47.710
but he had a pay phone
for all his house guests.

16:47.712 --> 16:50.178
Oh god, what a cheapskate.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.547
I hate that!

16:52.549 --> 16:54.683
Yeah.

16:54.685 --> 16:56.586
Me too.

16:57.654 --> 16:59.021
Hey, isn't that,
that restaurant

16:59.023 --> 17:00.625
where all the
celebrities hang out?

17:01.058 --> 17:01.957
Yeah.

17:01.959 --> 17:03.225
Have
you ever been there?

17:03.227 --> 17:04.160
Sure.

17:04.162 --> 17:05.630
Oh, I bet it's amazing.

17:36.227 --> 17:37.526
It's gettin'
kinda chilly, huh.

17:37.528 --> 17:38.762
- Yeah.
- Wanna head back?

17:38.764 --> 17:40.531
Sure.

17:40.731 --> 17:43.668
Or, we could jump in the water.

17:46.304 --> 17:47.270
Yeah, right.

17:47.272 --> 17:48.405
No, I'm serious.

17:48.407 --> 17:50.507
Come on, Charlotte, you
just ate five course meal,

17:50.509 --> 17:51.408
you're not going for a swim.

17:51.410 --> 17:52.342
No, come on, let's do it.

17:52.344 --> 17:53.677
I've never even been
in the ocean before

17:53.679 --> 17:55.212
and it would just
be like absolutely...

17:55.214 --> 17:56.613
Hey, hey, listen to me.

17:56.615 --> 17:58.582
We're not jumping off the pier.

17:59.818 --> 18:00.985
Oh, my god.

18:01.653 --> 18:04.721
Okay, you are completely insane!

18:04.723 --> 18:05.555
Really?

18:05.557 --> 18:06.656
Yes, you're crazy.

18:06.658 --> 18:09.494
And you are the most
exciting guy I've ever met.

18:10.094 --> 18:10.627
Really?

18:10.629 --> 18:11.296
Yeah.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.122
All right, Carly, let's
see what you got me.

18:38.324 --> 18:39.390
How does...

18:39.392 --> 18:41.659
I don't even...

18:41.661 --> 18:43.228
I'm not using that.

18:51.303 --> 18:52.437
I've seen thicker dental floss.

19:00.647 --> 19:02.747
You are one sexy
bitch, Charlotte.

19:02.749 --> 19:05.149
And you've had sex
with a thousand men.

19:05.151 --> 19:05.883
With a hundred men.

19:05.885 --> 19:08.488
23, eight, eight.

19:16.596 --> 19:20.733
You're gonna go in there and
be just a super sexy lady.

19:22.735 --> 19:24.538
God, I look like my
mom with these things.

20:07.413 --> 20:08.112
Ow!

20:08.114 --> 20:09.580
Oh, oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

20:09.582 --> 20:10.581
So you like it rough?

20:10.583 --> 20:11.851
Huh, oh no, I was just...

20:11.853 --> 20:13.685
'Cause I can be really rough.

20:13.687 --> 20:16.889
Oh yeah, no, I'm rough,
I'm like super rough.

20:16.891 --> 20:18.390
Like this kinda rough?

20:18.392 --> 20:19.324
Ah!

20:19.326 --> 20:20.392
Oh!

20:20.394 --> 20:23.729
Goin' for the sexy proctologist,
yeah, no I dig that.

20:23.731 --> 20:24.596
Yeah?

20:24.598 --> 20:25.731
Is that all you got?

20:25.733 --> 20:27.566
You're in luck
'cause his two friends

20:27.568 --> 20:29.468
just decided to join the party.

20:37.244 --> 20:39.313
What're you thinking?

20:40.715 --> 20:42.651
I was just thinking, uhm

20:44.218 --> 20:47.352
I was just wondering,

20:47.354 --> 20:50.591
if it's too soon to
tell him that um,

20:51.793 --> 20:53.895
he's just the kind of man
I've always wanted to be with.

20:55.396 --> 20:58.530
Confident and uhm,

20:58.532 --> 21:00.767
unhesitating,

21:00.769 --> 21:02.203
sure of what he wants.

21:03.538 --> 21:04.904
Extremely handsome.

21:04.906 --> 21:07.006
Well.

21:07.008 --> 21:09.244
And um,

21:10.945 --> 21:13.213
it's gonna break my heart
to get back on that plane.

21:16.851 --> 21:18.651
Well, that's funny actually,

21:18.653 --> 21:23.824
because I was
thinking that she is

21:23.826 --> 21:27.427
the most exciting

21:27.429 --> 21:31.330
and spontaneous person

21:31.332 --> 21:34.300
I've met in my entire life.

21:34.302 --> 21:37.639
Not to mention gorgeous,
bombshell, knockout

21:38.740 --> 21:40.907
and blonde too, the
most blonde person.

21:44.612 --> 21:45.745
And I was actually wondering

21:45.747 --> 21:47.583
if it's too soon
to give her this.

21:51.554 --> 21:53.556
And to tell her that I love her.

22:21.917 --> 22:24.718
I know this is
moving insanely fast

22:24.720 --> 22:27.521
but she's not like
the women here.

22:27.523 --> 22:29.056
Is that a heel mark?

22:29.058 --> 22:31.391
She's sexy and smart

22:31.393 --> 22:32.926
and we just have
this, this connection!

22:32.928 --> 22:35.029
What did you get
on my upholstery?

22:35.031 --> 22:36.664
Oh, that's just saltwater.

22:36.666 --> 22:38.432
Is that what the
kids are calling it?

22:38.434 --> 22:40.367
You desecrated the Stang!

22:40.369 --> 22:41.703
Dude, I'll get it
washed and waxed.

22:41.705 --> 22:43.705
Are you listening to what
I'm saying, I'm in love.

22:43.707 --> 22:45.506
I can clearly see
that you're excited

22:45.508 --> 22:47.674
and I'm very happy
for you, really I am.

22:47.676 --> 22:48.711
Okay yes.

22:54.450 --> 22:56.350
You might wanna keep
this for your scrap book.

22:56.352 --> 22:56.986
Oh, yes.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.021
That's her neck.

23:00.023 --> 23:00.889
Just smell that.

23:00.891 --> 23:01.923
- No.
- Just smell.

23:01.925 --> 23:02.957
- It's just a neck.
- It's not..

23:02.959 --> 23:04.759
- It's a neutral zone.
- This is not appropriate.

23:04.761 --> 23:06.694
Oh god, that's good.

23:06.696 --> 23:10.598
And, did you do the
things that we talked about?

23:10.600 --> 23:12.467
We did things no
one talks about.

23:12.469 --> 23:15.402
Ooh, and how did that go?

23:15.404 --> 23:16.738
He gave me this.

23:16.740 --> 23:17.572
Oh, my god.

23:17.574 --> 23:19.707
And he told me
that he loves me.

23:19.709 --> 23:21.608
Oh, my god!

23:21.610 --> 23:22.978
I know, and I told
him I love him too

23:22.980 --> 23:25.713
which I know seems
like crazy and rushed

23:25.715 --> 23:28.550
but it was just so magical.

23:28.552 --> 23:30.420
That no good mother.

23:43.166 --> 23:44.732
You know, good for him.

23:44.734 --> 23:46.769
Good for him, he
deserves to be happy.

23:46.771 --> 23:48.504
Char...

23:48.506 --> 23:50.639
I know what you're gonna
say and I'm gonna be fine

23:50.641 --> 23:53.676
because I'm happy
and he's happy.

23:53.678 --> 23:55.578
- Charlotte!
- And everybody's happy.

23:55.580 --> 23:56.411
Charlotte!

23:56.413 --> 23:57.445
It's gonna be,

23:57.447 --> 23:58.115
oh my god!

24:09.060 --> 24:09.927
Asshole!

24:11.596 --> 24:14.730
No, you cannot cause an
avalanche just by yodeling.

24:14.732 --> 24:17.800
No, I am telling you,
it is completely possible.

24:17.802 --> 24:19.068
You can't.

24:19.070 --> 24:20.769
And even if you could,

24:20.771 --> 24:23.138
you can't make it fall right
on a fleeing bank robber.

24:23.140 --> 24:25.541
Schweizer Polizei Frau can.

24:25.543 --> 24:26.577
Yeah well.

24:27.845 --> 24:31.881
Hey, I made something at work
today, you mind taking a look?

24:31.883 --> 24:33.017
Yeah, sure.

24:39.157 --> 24:40.857
Hey, is that me?

24:40.859 --> 24:41.960
Lookin' good.

24:49.567 --> 24:51.903
Oh, thank you, it's beautiful.

25:03.882 --> 25:07.753
It would be the most
unpredictable thing ever.

25:09.755 --> 25:12.958
It would be the
ultimate commitment.

25:22.734 --> 25:23.702
Geronimo!

25:35.013 --> 25:36.112
We want a divorce.

25:36.114 --> 25:37.614
Between the two of ya?

25:37.616 --> 25:38.581
Yep.

25:38.583 --> 25:39.816
Well, I'll be, usually,

25:39.818 --> 25:42.585
I represent only one
party's interests.

25:42.587 --> 25:43.520
We have the same interest.

25:43.522 --> 25:44.721
An immediate divorce.

25:44.723 --> 25:46.824
Well then, I reckon
we oughta discuss

25:46.826 --> 25:48.626
dividin' property, assets...

25:48.628 --> 25:49.794
We don't have any.

25:49.796 --> 25:52.529
How long you two been hitched?

25:52.531 --> 25:53.898
BRANDON AND
CHARLOTTE: 10 days.

25:53.900 --> 25:54.767
10 days?

26:04.609 --> 26:05.608
Oh!

26:05.610 --> 26:06.776
Thank you so much, Carly.

26:06.778 --> 26:09.115
Thanks, Carly, it's awesome!

26:10.049 --> 26:11.749
Oh, and that is from us.

26:11.751 --> 26:12.850
Oh.

26:12.852 --> 26:13.720
Thank you.

26:21.728 --> 26:25.262
Aw, thank you very much, that's
so sweet, Jerry and Judy.

26:25.264 --> 26:27.765
Thanks, Mom, thanks,
Dad, that's uh.

26:27.767 --> 26:30.001
No, the people
of Tibet thank you.

26:30.003 --> 26:34.005
It's such a noble
gesture in your name.

26:34.007 --> 26:35.807
Though it has none of
the bourgeoisie cache

26:35.809 --> 26:38.045
of a shiny kitchen appliance.

26:39.847 --> 26:42.080
Anyway, speaking
of exotic places,

26:42.082 --> 26:43.647
have you guys finally decided

26:43.649 --> 26:44.582
where you're gonna
take your honeymoon?

26:44.584 --> 26:46.917
Not yet, I'm start
teaching really soon

26:46.919 --> 26:50.355
and we have to find a bigger
apartment or maybe a house.

26:50.357 --> 26:52.089
Oh.

26:52.091 --> 26:54.091
So we have to
put that on hold.

26:54.093 --> 26:56.660
No, no, no, you must do
something special, Brandon.

26:56.662 --> 26:58.295
Sri Lanka is lovely.

26:58.297 --> 27:00.699
As far as exploited,
underdeveloped

27:00.701 --> 27:01.900
island nations go.

27:01.902 --> 27:05.037
It's really the sad teardrop
of the Indian subcontinent.

27:05.039 --> 27:06.738
But the beaches are beautiful.

27:06.740 --> 27:08.240
Well, that sounds
fun, right, honey?

27:08.242 --> 27:11.810
Oh yeah, it's just a shame
about all the tsunamis.

27:11.812 --> 27:13.245
I'll tell you what
though, for special,

27:13.247 --> 27:14.880
there's some really great spots

27:14.882 --> 27:16.747
right within driving distance.

27:16.749 --> 27:19.920
I mean, San Diego,
Santa Barbara, Pismo.

27:21.754 --> 27:22.621
Oh, what about you?

27:22.623 --> 27:24.223
Where'd you two go
on your honeymoon?

27:24.225 --> 27:25.324
Jail.

27:29.797 --> 27:31.029
He's not kidding.

27:31.031 --> 27:32.631
After we exchanged our vows,

27:32.633 --> 27:34.699
we went off to a No Nukes rally,

27:34.701 --> 27:37.370
she acted up and the
po-po picked us up

27:37.372 --> 27:38.770
and threw us both
in the slammer.

27:38.772 --> 27:41.306
So you spent your
whole honeymoon in jail?

27:41.308 --> 27:42.475
We had only known
each other 10 days

27:42.477 --> 27:46.779
so every minute we spent
together was like a honeymoon.

27:46.781 --> 27:50.649
And we actually managed to slip
a little connubial bliss in

27:50.651 --> 27:52.754
right under the man's nose.

27:55.190 --> 27:57.290
So we were in
adjacent cells, right,

27:57.292 --> 27:59.992
and right after all of the
other inmates went to sleep,

27:59.994 --> 28:02.861
my beautiful bride, she
backed her tight little rump

28:02.863 --> 28:04.863
right up against the bars,

28:04.865 --> 28:09.868
I dropped trou and we made
the sweetest, sweetest love.

28:09.870 --> 28:12.740
Oh, oh, Christ,
I need a drink!

28:16.878 --> 28:19.145
Being an only child and
losing both my parents,

28:19.147 --> 28:22.281
I definitely want a big family,
like three or four kids.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.450
You know, they say, it
costs over a quarter million

28:24.452 --> 28:27.753
to raise a child and
that's before college.

28:27.755 --> 28:30.756
You can't put a
price tag on happiness.

28:30.758 --> 28:34.727
True but I was an only
child and I have to say,

28:34.729 --> 28:35.462
I was very happy.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.431
Oh come on, Brandon.

28:37.433 --> 28:39.266
You use to always want
a younger brother.

28:39.268 --> 28:42.369
And a matter of fact,
Brandon was an accident.

28:42.371 --> 28:44.071
We thought long and hard

28:44.073 --> 28:46.072
about whether or not
we should keep him.

28:46.074 --> 28:47.940
You were gonna put
him up for adoption?

28:47.942 --> 28:50.344
Oh god no, I wouldn't
have the heart for that.

28:50.346 --> 28:53.045
We were gonna abort him.

28:53.047 --> 28:53.915
Jesus.

28:55.016 --> 28:56.716
But we were in Burma,

28:56.718 --> 28:59.052
we couldn't find anyone
to perform the procedure.

28:59.054 --> 29:00.022
Thank god.

29:01.157 --> 29:03.390
I think we made
the right decision.

29:03.392 --> 29:04.326
I do too.

29:05.761 --> 29:06.960
Most of the time.

29:06.962 --> 29:09.329
Oh, Jerry.

29:09.331 --> 29:10.497
Hey, you know, we
better get going,

29:10.499 --> 29:13.834
we got a flight to catch, we
gotta get to Buenos Aries.

29:13.836 --> 29:16.069
Oh, leaving so soon?

29:16.071 --> 29:17.337
We're gonna the Antarctica,

29:17.339 --> 29:19.872
we're gonna scuttle some
Japanese whale killers.

29:19.874 --> 29:20.773
If it were up to me,

29:20.775 --> 29:23.311
I'd have those boats
sunk in the ocean

29:23.313 --> 29:26.847
and have any remaining
survivors fed to the sharks.

29:26.849 --> 29:28.815
I hear you, I
respect your feelings.

29:28.817 --> 29:31.885
Now, get you things we
gotta go, we gonna be late.

29:31.887 --> 29:34.522
Charlotte, it's been
so lovely meeting you.

29:34.524 --> 29:35.523
Likewise.

29:35.525 --> 29:37.124
Carly, till next time.

29:37.126 --> 29:38.992
Okay, let's go.

29:38.994 --> 29:43.699
She gets so blood thirsty
when it comes to the Japanese.

29:45.834 --> 29:47.502
Those are some
weird fucking people.

29:47.504 --> 29:50.807
Okay, I don't
know, they're unique.

29:52.409 --> 29:54.542
It's kinda refreshing.

29:54.544 --> 29:55.876
You need to be thankful

29:55.878 --> 29:57.212
that their DNA
skipped a generation.

29:59.149 --> 30:01.949
But isn't, Brandon's
pretty amazing, right?

30:01.951 --> 30:04.117
You did good, girl.

30:04.119 --> 30:06.820
And he can't freak if he finds
out that you're a jail bird.

30:06.822 --> 30:07.955
'Cause with parents like that,

30:07.957 --> 30:09.557
he was probably
conceived in the joint.

30:09.559 --> 30:11.826
Why would you tell
Charlotte the Stang is yours?

30:11.828 --> 30:13.194
You're the one
who told me to lie.

30:13.196 --> 30:15.196
When you're trying to
lure her to the honey pot!

30:15.198 --> 30:17.031
You can't keep it going
now that you're married.

30:17.033 --> 30:18.266
It's insane.

30:18.268 --> 30:19.568
Just let me break it
to her slowly, okay?

30:19.570 --> 30:22.337
Can you go along with
it for a couple weeks?

30:22.339 --> 30:23.471
Come on man, you
have another car.

30:23.473 --> 30:24.472
Please, I'll owe you.

30:24.474 --> 30:25.406
With what?

30:25.408 --> 30:26.808
You don't have any money.

30:26.810 --> 30:28.009
Which you also told me
not to tell her about.

30:28.011 --> 30:30.979
And now she's talking about
honeymoons and houses and kids.

30:30.981 --> 30:33.348
Well, you screwed up,
man, you took my advice.

30:33.350 --> 30:36.018
Okay, okay, okay okay,
you can take the Stang

30:36.020 --> 30:37.986
for a couple more weeks but, but

30:37.988 --> 30:40.089
if I see you drive
it more than twice,

30:40.091 --> 30:42.090
I will bring down
your house of cards.

30:42.092 --> 30:43.091
Understood, thanks.

30:43.093 --> 30:44.593
I'll see you at dinner.

30:44.595 --> 30:47.496
No, this is yours now,
you have to take care of it!

30:47.498 --> 30:48.332
Oh!

30:49.567 --> 30:51.567
Our first dinner party
as a married couple.

30:51.569 --> 30:52.401
Yeah.

30:52.403 --> 30:54.436
What are you making?

30:54.438 --> 30:59.377
Well, I thought maybe you
could make your homemade pasta.

31:04.215 --> 31:06.548
I remember on our honeymoon,
we went to a movie in Maui

31:06.550 --> 31:08.884
and Dan was playing
with his wedding ring,

31:08.886 --> 31:11.053
it fell off and
rolled down the floor.

31:11.055 --> 31:12.288
Ting, ting, ting, ting.

31:12.290 --> 31:13.888
We had to wait till
the movie was over

31:13.890 --> 31:15.190
and then search through
all this popcorn

31:15.192 --> 31:17.859
and crud and found it
in a puddle of Pepsi.

31:17.861 --> 31:19.328
She was really mad.

31:19.330 --> 31:20.995
And then the next
week, he does it again!

31:20.997 --> 31:23.899
And she punched me
right in the dick.

31:25.637 --> 31:28.571
You're lucky I
didn't divorce you.

31:28.573 --> 31:31.106
It turned out he done
it intentionally.

31:31.108 --> 31:33.042
Well yeah, so I had
tied it to a string

31:33.044 --> 31:35.545
and I was pulling it along
and she kept going after it.

31:35.547 --> 31:37.012
That was really.

31:39.583 --> 31:41.350
Oh god, weren't you furious?

31:41.352 --> 31:42.186
Yes.

31:43.421 --> 31:46.121
But then I realized
that this is who Dan is

31:46.123 --> 31:48.058
and that's why I love him.

31:48.060 --> 31:49.426
That's why she loves me.

31:49.428 --> 31:50.660
He's a lovable jackass.

31:50.662 --> 31:52.595
My ass is very jacked.

31:54.399 --> 31:55.200
Moving on!

31:56.535 --> 31:59.369
Brandon, what is
your biggest regret?

31:59.371 --> 32:01.604
My choice of best friends.

32:01.606 --> 32:02.572
I was just being honest.

32:02.574 --> 32:04.842
I'm just being honest.

32:06.378 --> 32:09.044
I guess maybe not
visiting my grandpa enough

32:09.046 --> 32:10.315
before he died.

32:11.451 --> 32:12.550
He was living in
this nursing home

32:12.552 --> 32:15.686
like a mile from our house and,

32:15.688 --> 32:17.120
I don't know, I
guess I was too busy

32:17.122 --> 32:19.324
being a teenager or something.

32:21.960 --> 32:25.161
Anyway, I hope he forgave me.

32:25.163 --> 32:26.563
Of course he did.

32:26.565 --> 32:28.433
He knew you loved him.

32:43.683 --> 32:47.117
Okay, I gonna say
what we're all thinking.

32:47.119 --> 32:47.953
Four-way.

32:49.054 --> 32:49.888
Hey!

33:00.666 --> 33:03.667
Hey, how come you never
wear that necklace I gave you?

33:03.669 --> 33:05.469
Don't you like it?

33:05.471 --> 33:06.404
I love it.

33:06.406 --> 33:08.174
I absolutely love it.

33:09.008 --> 33:10.741
And you know what else I love?

33:10.743 --> 33:12.610
That pretty little ass of yours.

33:15.548 --> 33:18.284
You remember the three amigos?

33:23.089 --> 33:23.956
Arriba!

33:24.725 --> 33:26.058
Whoo!

33:36.602 --> 33:39.537
Schweitzer Polizei Frau.

33:46.012 --> 33:47.579
What are you working on?

33:47.581 --> 33:49.448
Welfare application.

33:49.450 --> 33:51.049
You?

33:51.051 --> 33:52.617
Suicide note.

33:52.619 --> 33:53.687
Touche.

33:55.222 --> 33:56.788
You know, screw it!

33:56.790 --> 33:59.724
I guess I'm gonna call
that slimy prick Matthew

33:59.726 --> 34:01.326
and see if he'll
throw us a bone.

34:01.328 --> 34:03.697
Oh man, that's gonna suck.

34:05.064 --> 34:06.598
You just know he's gonna make
you feel like a pathetic,

34:06.600 --> 34:09.099
shit-eating failure.

34:09.101 --> 34:10.638
I'll call for you.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.105
I'm just so glad I found it.

34:14.107 --> 34:15.607
I had to go to 10 different
stores to find it,

34:15.609 --> 34:17.444
and it cost $1,200.

34:18.277 --> 34:19.643
Oh, at that price,

34:19.646 --> 34:20.779
I think I would have
just come clean.

34:20.781 --> 34:25.583
Yeah, I wanted to but he
spent so much money on it,

34:25.585 --> 34:29.187
and, I don't know, he
picked it out himself

34:29.188 --> 34:31.692
which I think is very sweet, so.

34:34.094 --> 34:35.695
So, you
must be looking forward

34:35.697 --> 34:37.429
to getting back to work, huh?

34:37.431 --> 34:40.833
Yes, I'm so excited to be
back in the classroom with kids.

34:40.835 --> 34:42.702
It's gonna be nice to have
income coming in, too.

34:42.704 --> 34:44.704
Speaking of which,
I was thinking

34:44.706 --> 34:46.438
that we could start
planning our honeymoon.

34:46.440 --> 34:49.241
You know, maybe go
on my spring break.

34:49.243 --> 34:51.578
What do you think about Aruba?

34:53.280 --> 34:55.179
Yeah, that's fine.

34:55.181 --> 34:58.751
But what about
Catalina Island, huh?

34:58.753 --> 35:02.788
It's 26 miles across the
sea, it is beautiful.

35:02.790 --> 35:06.859
It's, uh, I mean, it's
where Natalie Wood drowned.

35:06.861 --> 35:08.661
Sounds romantic.

35:08.663 --> 35:10.229
Hey, you know what?

35:10.231 --> 35:12.231
I think we have to have
a couple drinks tonight.

35:12.233 --> 35:13.098
- Yeah?
- To celebrate

35:13.100 --> 35:14.300
your last couple
of days of leisure.

35:14.302 --> 35:15.268
What do you say?

35:15.270 --> 35:16.101
I like that.

35:16.103 --> 35:17.436
Let me do that.

35:17.438 --> 35:19.605
All right, get out
there, make me proud,

35:19.607 --> 35:22.076
show me some of those tricks.

35:31.887 --> 35:33.720
Achtung, ladies and gentlemen,

35:33.722 --> 35:38.391
he's about to shame,
bruise and soil himself.

35:42.363 --> 35:43.231
Fuck!

35:54.376 --> 35:57.477
Oh my god,
Barndon, are you okay?

35:57.479 --> 36:00.547
Yeah, yeah,
no, I meant to do that.

36:00.549 --> 36:01.417
Oh god.

36:11.594 --> 36:13.160
Hey Brandon.

36:13.162 --> 36:14.661
I brought you a little
somethin' for the newlyweds.

36:14.663 --> 36:16.496
Oh Mel, thank you.

36:16.498 --> 36:17.331
Cheers.

36:17.333 --> 36:18.165
Cheers.

36:18.167 --> 36:18.900
Shots.

36:18.902 --> 36:20.567
To all your lucky students.

36:20.569 --> 36:23.236
To my sweet husband
and all my bros and hoes.

36:23.238 --> 36:24.106
Yeah!

36:25.007 --> 36:26.607
Excuse me
ladies and gentlemen,

36:26.609 --> 36:28.842
can I get Charlotte
Conroy on the dance floor?

36:28.844 --> 36:29.676
What?

36:29.678 --> 36:30.711
Did he say my name?

36:30.713 --> 36:31.545
I guess.

36:31.547 --> 36:32.679
What did you tell him?

36:32.681 --> 36:34.315
Yeah, everyone, put your
hands together right here,

36:34.317 --> 36:36.651
Miss Charlotte, the
dancing machine, Conroy,

36:36.653 --> 36:39.921
salsa champion, world
champion in the house tonight!

36:39.923 --> 36:40.755
That's you.

36:40.757 --> 36:41.856
What did you tell him?

36:41.858 --> 36:43.290
I may have
exaggerated a little.

36:43.292 --> 36:44.859
I know you didn't wanna
show off at the wedding

36:44.861 --> 36:46.694
but now I get to see your stuff!

36:51.735 --> 36:52.601
Yeah!

36:59.576 --> 37:00.842
SCHWEITZER POLIZEI
FRAU: And that is all

37:00.844 --> 37:03.444
the salsa Charlotte knows,

37:03.446 --> 37:05.782
but tragically, she dances on.

37:34.344 --> 37:36.344
Well look who's here.

37:36.346 --> 37:39.480
The asshole who almost
smothered me to death.

37:39.482 --> 37:40.581
Ashley?

37:40.583 --> 37:43.584
You would still hang out
here, you cheap bastard.

37:43.586 --> 37:44.752
I'm just kidding.

37:44.754 --> 37:45.854
I come here too.

37:45.856 --> 37:47.556
Ashley, I am...

37:47.558 --> 37:50.728
You, are not still
mad at me, are you?

37:54.732 --> 37:59.467
Okay, Charlotte, thank
you, thank you very much.

37:59.469 --> 38:01.337
Very interesting dance.

38:03.841 --> 38:05.273
Hey, honey.

38:05.275 --> 38:06.742
Who's your friend?

38:06.744 --> 38:07.743
Ashley.

38:07.745 --> 38:10.579
Charlotte, Charlotte Conroy.

38:10.581 --> 38:11.613
Who's that, your sister?

38:11.615 --> 38:13.049
No, his wife.

38:13.051 --> 38:16.351
I'm sorry, you're married?

38:16.353 --> 38:17.486
Since when?

38:17.488 --> 38:18.656
Four days ago.

38:20.624 --> 38:23.792
We used to date until he
went all fainting goat on,

38:23.794 --> 38:25.627
what the fuck?

38:25.629 --> 38:27.296
That's my necklace!

38:27.298 --> 38:28.030
Oh shit.

38:28.032 --> 38:29.064
What the hell, Brandon?

38:29.066 --> 38:30.532
Brandon?

38:30.534 --> 38:31.633
Yeah, I left it at his place.

38:31.635 --> 38:32.968
He never gave it back to me.

38:32.970 --> 38:34.473
Is that true?

38:36.508 --> 38:37.507
Told ya.

38:37.509 --> 38:39.508
This isn't your necklace.

38:39.510 --> 38:40.442
The hell it isn't.

38:40.444 --> 38:41.711
Okay.

38:41.713 --> 38:42.812
No, I
think your necklace

38:42.814 --> 38:43.947
I ground up in the
garbage disposal.

38:43.949 --> 38:45.347
Bullshit!

38:45.349 --> 38:46.750
Listen,
I was freaked out

38:46.752 --> 38:48.350
because I found out my
ex-fiance was getting married.

38:48.352 --> 38:49.318
Ex-fiance?

38:49.320 --> 38:50.652
Okay, like you have
the right to speak,

38:50.654 --> 38:52.354
you gave this skank's necklace!

38:52.356 --> 38:54.456
Oh my god, this is hilarious.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.627
You wanna know what I think?

39:00.465 --> 39:02.499
You're not gonna do anything?

39:02.501 --> 39:03.368
Stop!

39:06.104 --> 39:07.904
Look at it this way,
most women our age

39:07.906 --> 39:09.739
have a lot of wear
and tear on 'em

39:09.741 --> 39:11.541
but you got her from
the original owner.

39:11.543 --> 39:13.510
She's in mint condition.

39:13.512 --> 39:15.779
Anyway, you really trumped
her on that necklace debacle.

39:15.781 --> 39:16.780
What were you thinking?

39:16.782 --> 39:17.714
I don't know, man.

39:17.716 --> 39:19.048
Never the twain shall meet?

39:19.050 --> 39:22.452
Okay, once, when
Rita and I were married

39:22.454 --> 39:24.955
for maybe two months, she
asked me if this dress

39:24.957 --> 39:26.723
she was wearing made
her butt look big.

39:26.725 --> 39:29.093
I told her, yes, but
I like big butts.

39:29.095 --> 39:30.426
You know, I'm a black man.

39:30.428 --> 39:31.761
It nearly ruined us.

39:31.763 --> 39:33.630
But it didn't.

39:33.632 --> 39:36.633
It took some work and
that's what you gotta do, man.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.968
You gotta make some
grand gesture, all right?

39:38.970 --> 39:41.404
Something repentant and sweet.

39:41.406 --> 39:42.505
Maybe a little pathetic
thrown in there

39:42.507 --> 39:47.511
and with any luck, it will
all be forgotten about.

39:47.513 --> 39:48.781
In a few years.

39:51.050 --> 39:51.918
Come on.

39:57.824 --> 39:59.824
God, it was so humiliating.

39:59.826 --> 40:01.058
So you
both screwed up.

40:01.060 --> 40:03.628
You each take a
gimme and move on.

40:04.764 --> 40:07.965
I just got an email from him.

40:15.142 --> 40:17.543
Oh my gosh, it's so sweet!

40:18.644 --> 40:20.044
He just sent me
the cutest apology.

40:20.046 --> 40:20.878
See?

40:20.880 --> 40:22.613
He's a peach.

40:22.615 --> 40:24.949
Do something nice for him
tonight, like really nice.

40:24.951 --> 40:26.584
Did you get that
link I sent you?

40:26.586 --> 40:28.152
Oh, that site was nasty.

40:28.154 --> 40:29.689
Exactly.

40:52.678 --> 40:53.978
Not in the bedroom.

41:00.020 --> 41:00.852
Lower.

41:10.530 --> 41:11.963
This is ridiculous.

41:11.965 --> 41:13.732
They've been making
this racket for hours.

41:13.734 --> 41:15.834
What the hell are
they trying to prove?

41:16.703 --> 41:18.670
Dan, maybe you
should come to bed.

41:18.672 --> 41:21.039
Yeah, yeah, in a minute.

41:40.827 --> 41:41.628
Oh my god.

41:43.797 --> 41:45.800
Oh, that was incredible.

41:47.001 --> 41:48.703
Okay, I gotta pee.

42:05.552 --> 42:08.020
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

42:08.022 --> 42:10.656
You haven't had problems
down their before, have you?

42:10.658 --> 42:11.526
Never.

42:13.828 --> 42:15.930
Brandon Conroy.

42:22.603 --> 42:23.803
Hello Mr. Conroy.

42:23.805 --> 42:24.637
Hi.

42:24.639 --> 42:25.905
I'm Dr. Sahni.

42:25.907 --> 42:28.674
Oh, yeah, I normally
see Dr. Kurtzman?

42:28.676 --> 42:31.777
Oh, he retired five
or six months ago.

42:31.779 --> 42:33.947
This is my first week.

42:33.949 --> 42:34.817
Welcome.

42:35.684 --> 42:37.818
So, what's the problem?

42:37.820 --> 42:41.554
It's like someone took a
sand blaster to my boom stick.

42:41.556 --> 42:43.125
Let's have a look.

42:46.627 --> 42:47.662
Oh my god.

42:48.663 --> 42:49.795
This looks like something I saw

42:49.797 --> 42:51.797
in my tropical disease seminar.

42:51.799 --> 42:53.133
How long's it been like this?

42:53.135 --> 42:54.567
Just since this morning.

42:54.569 --> 42:56.902
And before that,
was your penis normal

42:56.904 --> 42:59.675
or has it always
been disfigured?

43:00.709 --> 43:02.809
Normal, it's normal.

43:02.811 --> 43:04.111
Do you work with
toxic chemicals?

43:04.113 --> 43:05.245
No.

43:05.247 --> 43:06.346
Have you recently spent
time in the African bush?

43:06.348 --> 43:07.581
No.

43:07.583 --> 43:09.583
Have you had sex with any
prostitutes from that region?

43:09.585 --> 43:10.350
No!

43:10.352 --> 43:12.219
Any exposure to monkey feces?

43:12.221 --> 43:13.720
Monkey feces?

43:13.722 --> 43:15.789
So, no interspecies
intercourse?

43:15.791 --> 43:16.923
Oh, for fuck, no!

43:16.925 --> 43:18.758
Mr. Conroy, I'm
going to need the names

43:18.760 --> 43:20.795
of your sexual partners.

43:23.199 --> 43:25.899
Get Dr. Palmer down here right
away to look at Mr. Conroy.

43:25.901 --> 43:29.036
We have a possible miasmic
STD of unknown origin.

43:29.038 --> 43:30.704
Is it that serious?

43:30.706 --> 43:33.274
He's had sex with 21 women
in the last four years.

43:33.276 --> 43:34.210
Go, go, go.

43:36.945 --> 43:39.079
I've never seen
anything like this before.

43:39.081 --> 43:40.714
It looks like a mix
of genital herpes,

43:40.716 --> 43:42.816
syphilis and a gun shot wound.

43:42.818 --> 43:45.287
Maybe it's a mutant hybrid?

43:46.656 --> 43:47.922
You ask him about money feces?

43:47.924 --> 43:49.893
I did, and negative.

43:51.327 --> 43:52.960
Sterile swab.

43:52.962 --> 43:54.228
Whoa.

43:54.230 --> 43:55.963
What's up with the swab?

43:55.965 --> 43:58.866
I'm gonna insert this into
your urethra, get a culture,

43:58.868 --> 44:00.234
run a test and see
if we can figure out

44:00.236 --> 44:02.702
what's goin' on with you, okay?

44:02.704 --> 44:03.772
'Kay.

44:06.842 --> 44:07.709
Hmm.

44:20.090 --> 44:21.656
Oh god.

44:21.658 --> 44:22.356
There we go.

44:22.358 --> 44:24.761
That wasn't so bad, was it?

44:28.231 --> 44:30.098
I'm so sorry.

44:30.100 --> 44:31.299
It's okay, we got another one.

44:31.301 --> 44:32.733
No that's good.

44:32.735 --> 44:34.103
I'm sure that's fine.

44:34.105 --> 44:37.039
Come on, the three
second rule, right?

44:37.041 --> 44:40.042
It's okay, let's try
this again, shall we?

44:40.044 --> 44:41.078
Please no.

44:55.459 --> 44:56.858
Hey.

44:56.860 --> 44:59.194
Oh sweetie, thank
god you're here.

44:59.196 --> 45:00.896
How you doing, honey?

45:00.898 --> 45:02.831
They don't know what I have.

45:02.833 --> 45:05.367
Oh, I'm sure
everything will be okay

45:05.369 --> 45:07.436
once they figure out
which one of your 21 sluts

45:07.438 --> 45:09.171
gave you the disease!

45:09.173 --> 45:11.874
Whatever happened to
quality over quantity?

45:11.876 --> 45:15.844
The numbers don't matter,
I always wore condoms.

45:15.846 --> 45:16.979
Except with you.

45:16.981 --> 45:18.180
Oh please!

45:18.182 --> 45:20.349
I only slept with
one man for 14 years.

45:20.351 --> 45:21.783
But who did he
sleep with, huh?

45:21.785 --> 45:23.921
You're so full of shit!

45:25.123 --> 45:26.389
I'm his wife!

45:26.391 --> 45:28.090
Oh yes, I imagined so.

45:28.092 --> 45:29.758
I'm Dr. Dietz, now let's see

45:29.760 --> 45:32.730
what all this
excitement's about.

45:34.198 --> 45:36.131
You already checked for
monkey feces, right?

45:36.133 --> 45:37.001
I did.

45:44.408 --> 45:47.510
Mr. Conroy, you have cystitis.

45:47.512 --> 45:48.478
Oh god.

45:48.480 --> 45:49.379
Shit.

45:49.381 --> 45:52.781
Commonly known as
honeymoon disease

45:52.783 --> 45:56.352
from too much intense
sexual activity.

45:56.354 --> 45:58.887
You just need to give
the little fellow a rest.

45:58.889 --> 46:01.391
Avoid sex for four or five days.

46:01.393 --> 46:04.093
Only touch it when
absolutely necessary

46:04.095 --> 46:06.762
and you'll be right
as rain in no time.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.132
Oh, thank god.

46:09.435 --> 46:11.134
Oh, thank you.

46:11.136 --> 46:12.869
You can put that down.

46:12.871 --> 46:15.271
I'm sorry.

46:15.273 --> 46:16.906
So, let me get this straight,

46:16.908 --> 46:20.544
they swabbed your schlong
twice, yet they didn't have to?

46:20.546 --> 46:22.045
Yeah.

46:25.550 --> 46:29.988
Oh boy, that is marriage
in a nutshell, ain't it?

46:37.263 --> 46:40.064
Mrs. Halvorsen, I was just
getting ready for tomorrow.

46:40.066 --> 46:42.031
I'm afraid there's a problem.

46:42.033 --> 46:44.801
We just received your
background check.

46:44.803 --> 46:47.204
You were arrested for a felony.

46:47.206 --> 46:49.540
But I received a
deferred adjudication.

46:49.542 --> 46:51.007
I wasn't convicted.

46:51.009 --> 46:53.410
I was still able to
teach in West Virginia.

46:53.412 --> 46:55.979
Obviously we hold a
higher standard here

46:55.981 --> 46:57.815
at Van Nuys Christian.

46:57.817 --> 46:59.149
I'm an excellent teacher,
I've been teaching for...

46:59.151 --> 47:00.351
I'm sorry.

47:00.353 --> 47:02.419
Maybe if you hadn't
been dishonest,

47:02.421 --> 47:05.522
but we're going to have to
terminate your contract.

47:05.524 --> 47:07.958
I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to lie,

47:07.960 --> 47:09.994
I was just trying to
make a good impression.

47:11.931 --> 47:13.464
Don't apologize to me.

47:13.466 --> 47:15.067
Apologize to Jesus.

47:48.635 --> 47:50.602
You're still upset about
what happened yesterday,

47:50.604 --> 47:51.403
aren't you?

47:51.405 --> 47:52.939
Yeah, I mean no.

47:56.443 --> 47:59.611
Look, we've both
make mistakes and,

47:59.613 --> 48:00.978
I don't think we
should judge each other

48:00.980 --> 48:03.348
for things that
happened before we met.

48:03.350 --> 48:05.650
Yeah, no, I completely agree.

48:05.652 --> 48:10.121
The past is the past and we
should just be looking forward

48:10.123 --> 48:12.427
to the road ahead together.

48:23.437 --> 48:26.840
At least it's all
out in the open now.

48:28.508 --> 48:30.342
Look, I wanna tell you,

48:30.344 --> 48:31.877
I need to tell you

48:33.914 --> 48:35.849
that I agree 100%.

48:36.617 --> 48:37.485
Good.

48:40.488 --> 48:41.654
Oh, this is one of
my favorite episodes.

48:41.656 --> 48:43.121
Have you seen this one?

48:43.123 --> 48:44.390
No.

48:44.392 --> 48:46.259
Oh, this is classic.

49:01.676 --> 49:04.176
Ah, I won a Golden Heidi

49:04.178 --> 49:05.613
for that episode.

49:11.386 --> 49:13.154
I'll be right back.

49:30.104 --> 49:32.238
Hey, packed your
lunch for you.

49:32.240 --> 49:35.575
Oh my god, where
did you find this?

49:35.577 --> 49:36.612
I made it.

49:39.614 --> 49:41.482
Knock 'em dead, honey.

49:57.599 --> 49:59.699
I feel like such
a scam artist.

49:59.701 --> 50:02.469
I'm not built for this
kind of deception.

50:02.471 --> 50:04.704
Okay well, why don't you just
find another job real quick

50:04.706 --> 50:07.607
and then tell Brandon
you got a better offer?

50:07.609 --> 50:09.309
Finding one's not the problem.

50:09.311 --> 50:12.345
I got an interview at 12, I
just, I mean what's the point?

50:12.347 --> 50:14.114
They'll just vet me too.

50:14.116 --> 50:17.551
No one's gonna let a low down
ex-con near their children.

50:17.553 --> 50:18.618
Hmm.

50:18.620 --> 50:20.053
Oh, I got it!

50:20.055 --> 50:22.556
Okay, your middle
name is Lauren, right?

50:22.558 --> 50:26.259
So why don't you spell it
L-A-U-R-A-N instead of E-N

50:26.261 --> 50:28.261
and then your record
won't come up.

50:28.263 --> 50:29.763
Would that really work?

50:29.765 --> 50:30.697
I don't know.

50:30.699 --> 50:32.699
What have you got to lose?

50:32.701 --> 50:33.734
You know what?

50:33.736 --> 50:34.769
Nothing, you're right.

50:34.771 --> 50:36.237
You're absolutely right.

50:36.239 --> 50:39.676
Thank you so much,
you're a total genius.

50:42.345 --> 50:43.811
My car won't start.

50:43.813 --> 50:45.613
Okay, why don't you just
call Brandon real quick

50:45.615 --> 50:46.179
and then ask him...

50:46.181 --> 50:47.147
I can't call Brandon

50:47.149 --> 50:48.281
and ask him to take
me to a job interview

50:48.283 --> 50:50.050
when I'm supposed to be in
a job that I already have!

50:50.052 --> 50:50.685
Goodbye!

50:50.687 --> 50:51.721
Shit.

50:53.690 --> 50:55.288
Shit.

50:59.262 --> 51:00.094
Hey, Charlotte.

51:00.096 --> 51:00.997
Hey, Dan.

51:04.701 --> 51:05.733
Bye, Dan.

51:05.735 --> 51:06.603
Bye.

51:20.082 --> 51:23.654
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

51:25.623 --> 51:26.690
Goddammit!

51:40.603 --> 51:43.671
Eight years
teaching first grade.

51:43.673 --> 51:46.608
Volunteer for the Red Cross.

51:46.610 --> 51:49.313
Girl Scout camp summer leader.

51:50.714 --> 51:52.781
Oh, you went to UWV!

51:52.783 --> 51:54.148
Yeah.

51:54.150 --> 51:55.217
Proud Mountaineer here!

51:55.219 --> 51:56.150
You too?

51:56.152 --> 51:56.785
Teal pride.

52:03.694 --> 52:05.761
Oh, is Professor
Vassic still there?

52:05.763 --> 52:08.897
Oh yes, I loved
him, he was amazing.

52:08.899 --> 52:12.702
Well, then I know you
have an excellent education.

52:12.704 --> 52:13.602
Actually Mrs. Newton,

52:13.604 --> 52:16.640
there's something
I need to tell you.

52:18.442 --> 52:19.876
Hey, Brandon.

52:19.878 --> 52:20.844
Hey, bro.

52:23.747 --> 52:26.615
Look, there's no easy
way to say this, man.

52:26.617 --> 52:28.650
A senior project
manager over at Plan C

52:28.652 --> 52:29.885
is moving to London,

52:29.887 --> 52:33.358
so Matthew called and
offered me the job.

52:36.160 --> 52:37.192
What can I say, man?

52:37.194 --> 52:38.795
I'm a weasel.

52:38.797 --> 52:41.633
I'm a weasel and I'm a sellout.

52:42.801 --> 52:44.301
Well, thanks.

52:45.469 --> 52:46.836
No bullshit, I fought for you.

52:46.838 --> 52:48.370
I swear, man.

52:48.372 --> 52:49.540
Look, I'm old.

52:50.608 --> 52:52.742
I got alimony
payments up the wang.

52:52.744 --> 52:54.710
You can still use the
office, if you want.

52:54.712 --> 52:57.382
Nah, it's your garage and all.

53:01.786 --> 53:06.625
Yeah, and so, I just wanted
to be completely up front.

53:07.759 --> 53:09.559
I appreciate your
candor, Charlotte.

53:09.561 --> 53:12.228
And I'd like to think we're
a little more forgiving

53:12.230 --> 53:16.733
than the Christians over at
Van Nuys Christian School.

53:16.735 --> 53:18.837
So, I'll get back to you.

53:36.488 --> 53:39.624
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

53:42.227 --> 53:46.265
Hi, I need to report a
stolen, or a missing car.

53:47.333 --> 53:49.201
I don't know where is,

53:51.237 --> 53:53.236
I don't know the
license plate number.

53:53.238 --> 53:56.573
Look, it's a Mustang,
it's really old.

53:56.575 --> 53:58.609
There can't be
that many of them.

53:58.611 --> 54:00.711
Look, I was really hoping
you can help me find this car

54:00.713 --> 54:03.981
before my husband finds
out that it's missing.

54:06.686 --> 54:09.689
Oh, my god.

54:11.858 --> 54:13.759
Call Brandon Conroy.

54:20.700 --> 54:22.433
Yeah.

54:22.435 --> 54:23.767
No, stop, stop!

54:23.769 --> 54:24.802
No, please stop, stop!

54:24.804 --> 54:25.736
Hey!

54:25.738 --> 54:27.640
Charlotte, are you okay?

54:28.974 --> 54:29.842
Charlotte!

54:30.676 --> 54:32.678
Charlotte, Charlotte!

54:33.647 --> 54:34.715
Dan.

54:36.683 --> 54:37.949
Dan, something
horrible has happened.

54:37.951 --> 54:38.883
What?

54:38.885 --> 54:40.518
Brandon's Mustang was stolen!

54:40.520 --> 54:41.553
No, not the Mustang!

54:41.555 --> 54:44.421
Yeah, he is gonna be furious.

54:44.423 --> 54:45.589
Did you call the police?

54:45.591 --> 54:47.826
Yes and when I didn't know
the license plate number,

54:47.828 --> 54:49.359
they just laughed at me.

54:49.361 --> 54:51.029
Do you happen to
know the number?

54:51.031 --> 54:52.463
Yes, I do.

54:53.666 --> 54:55.799
Why does he have that
stupid car anyways?

54:55.801 --> 54:56.969
But I thought you loved it.

54:56.971 --> 54:59.704
Yeah, I mean it's fun to
cruise around in sometimes

54:59.706 --> 55:01.773
but I mean come on,
it's ridiculous.

55:01.775 --> 55:03.641
It's just some
loud, gas guzzling,

55:03.643 --> 55:07.347
middle-aged-mobile for
men with tiny dicks.

55:08.749 --> 55:10.249
Come with me.

55:15.989 --> 55:19.391
Charlotte Conroy,
I need to see her!

55:21.629 --> 55:23.696
Oh my god, they
brought it back.

55:23.698 --> 55:25.998
No, I had a GPS tracker on it.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.734
Oh my god, oh my god, Dan,
thank you, thank you so much.

55:29.736 --> 55:31.738
You totally saved my life!

55:32.739 --> 55:34.039
Wait, why do you have a...

55:34.041 --> 55:35.774
It's mine, it's
mine, Charlotte.

55:35.776 --> 55:36.674
It's always been mine.

55:36.676 --> 55:38.777
It wasn't stolen, I
just took it back.

55:38.779 --> 55:40.378
But the car
belongs to Brandon.

55:40.380 --> 55:41.813
No, it doesn't.

55:41.815 --> 55:43.548
He borrowed it from me.

55:43.550 --> 55:46.385
I guess he was trying
to impress you.

55:46.387 --> 55:47.853
Why would that impress me?

55:47.855 --> 55:51.457
I don't know, maybe because
it makes him look cool

55:51.459 --> 55:53.893
and a little less broke.

55:53.895 --> 55:55.060
Brandon is broke?

55:55.062 --> 55:58.798
I shouldn't say
anything, I'm so sorry.

55:58.800 --> 55:59.732
He's worse than broke.

55:59.734 --> 56:02.367
He's in debt, calamitous,
crushing debt!

56:02.369 --> 56:04.569
You know what, you know, I'm
glad I'm saying something,

56:04.571 --> 56:06.972
this is for his own good.

56:06.974 --> 56:08.375
I feel better.

56:10.745 --> 56:13.079
Charlotte no
longer works here.

56:13.081 --> 56:13.913
What?

56:13.915 --> 56:15.381
We had to let her go.

56:15.383 --> 56:17.550
She has a felony for
assault and battery.

56:17.552 --> 56:18.884
It's shocking that
someone so well-mannered

56:18.886 --> 56:20.788
could be so vicious.

56:50.085 --> 56:50.953
Hey.

56:51.954 --> 56:52.820
Hey.

56:57.793 --> 57:01.962
Hey, what was up with
that phone call today?

57:01.964 --> 57:05.901
Oh, sorry, someone
almost backed into my car.

57:07.669 --> 57:08.537
Oh.

57:09.504 --> 57:10.470
But you're okay now?

57:10.472 --> 57:11.137
Oh yeah.

57:11.139 --> 57:12.839
Oh.

57:12.841 --> 57:14.007
Yeah.

57:14.009 --> 57:15.409
That's good.

57:16.645 --> 57:17.813
So how was work?

57:18.714 --> 57:21.082
Good day with all the kids?

57:21.084 --> 57:22.484
Yeah, great.

57:23.219 --> 57:24.819
How about you?

57:24.821 --> 57:26.455
Make lots of money?

57:27.723 --> 57:28.790
Yeah.

57:30.459 --> 57:31.660
That's good.

57:37.666 --> 57:39.532
By the way, your Aunt
Sallie Mae wrote.

57:39.534 --> 57:41.670
She'd like her $56,000 back.

57:46.943 --> 57:49.176
Why are you going
through my mail?

57:49.178 --> 57:51.846
Well, don't you
mean our mail, dear?

57:51.848 --> 57:53.681
We're married and
we share everything.

57:53.683 --> 57:55.683
Including a butt-load of debt.

57:55.685 --> 57:57.251
Huh, you wanna share?

57:57.253 --> 57:59.586
Okay, let's share.

57:59.588 --> 58:02.823
Tell me all about the felony
you committed, darling.

58:02.825 --> 58:04.058
What?

58:04.060 --> 58:07.861
You know, the thing
you lost your job over.

58:07.863 --> 58:08.863
You don't understand.

58:08.865 --> 58:09.864
No, I think I do.

58:09.866 --> 58:10.831
Assault and battery.

58:10.833 --> 58:11.933
It's right there in the title.

58:11.935 --> 58:13.000
Pretty self-explanatory.

58:13.002 --> 58:14.236
It was my ex-fiance.

58:14.238 --> 58:16.037
Oh, well that should
help me sleep at night.

58:16.039 --> 58:17.840
It was an accident!

58:18.942 --> 58:21.809
And you know what,
I wasn't convicted.

58:21.811 --> 58:25.179
And at least I paid my debt
to society, unlike you.

58:25.181 --> 58:27.715
Student loans aren't a crime.

58:27.717 --> 58:29.617
They are if you
don't pay them!

58:29.619 --> 58:31.185
Whoa, please don't
stab me with your shiv.

58:31.187 --> 58:33.855
They'll send you back to
the joint, sweetheart.

58:33.857 --> 58:37.726
At least there, you
know who people are.

58:37.728 --> 58:39.828
Then why don't
you call the warden

58:39.830 --> 58:41.797
and get your old bunk back.

58:41.799 --> 58:44.699
I have let a
lot of shit slide.

58:44.701 --> 58:45.968
Like what?

58:45.970 --> 58:48.769
You don't know the
first thing about cooking.

58:48.771 --> 58:49.837
Philip Seymour Hoffman

58:49.839 --> 58:52.573
is not the quarterback
of the San Diego Chargers

58:52.575 --> 58:54.942
and you, sir, are
no Lance Armstrong.

58:54.944 --> 58:55.876
Three words.

58:55.878 --> 58:58.247
Salsa, dancing, champion.

58:58.249 --> 59:00.582
Oh, and how long did you think

59:00.584 --> 59:03.986
that you could pretend
that stupid car was yours?

59:03.988 --> 59:05.721
Goddamn, Dan!

59:05.723 --> 59:06.922
And the worst part,

59:06.924 --> 59:09.725
the worst part is that you
make made me look like a idiot

59:09.727 --> 59:10.959
in front of Dan and Rita.

59:10.961 --> 59:13.895
Like the only friends that I
have in this miserable place.

59:13.897 --> 59:15.897
Hey, you make me
look like an idiot too.

59:15.899 --> 59:17.065
I didn't know who I married.

59:17.067 --> 59:19.700
Are you this sweet
adorable school teacher

59:19.702 --> 59:22.771
or a deranged grifter
come to ruin my life?

59:22.773 --> 59:24.240
Well, if you
really feel that way,

59:24.242 --> 59:27.110
then maybe, maybe, maybe
we should both admit

59:27.112 --> 59:29.312
that we made a mistake
and then just split ways!

59:29.314 --> 59:30.346
You know what,
maybe we should!

59:30.348 --> 59:31.180
Yeah?

59:31.182 --> 59:32.014
Yeah!

59:32.016 --> 59:32.848
Yeah!

59:32.850 --> 59:33.715
Fine!

59:33.717 --> 59:34.750
Fine!

59:34.752 --> 59:35.619
Fine!

59:38.055 --> 59:40.722
How long
you two been hitched?

59:40.724 --> 59:42.290
BRANDON AND
CHARLOTTE: 10 days.

59:42.292 --> 59:43.160
10 days?

59:44.863 --> 59:47.163
Are you celebrities
of some sort?

59:47.165 --> 59:48.164
No.

59:48.166 --> 59:49.632
Peculiar.

59:49.634 --> 59:51.134
So, how do we get
this thing started?

59:51.136 --> 59:52.769
First of all, let me be clear,

59:52.771 --> 59:54.804
I'm actin' as a
neutral third party

59:54.806 --> 59:57.940
helpin' to negotiate
a fair settlement.

59:57.942 --> 59:59.842
There's nothing to negotiate.

59:59.844 --> 01:00:01.643
We're in complete
divorce agreement.

01:00:01.645 --> 01:00:03.946
That's the only thing
we're in agreement on.

01:00:03.948 --> 01:00:06.015
Fair enough, I'll
draw up the contract

01:00:06.017 --> 01:00:08.918
and y'all can come back
next Thursday and sign it.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.919
Thursday?

01:00:09.921 --> 01:00:11.355
Why not today?

01:00:11.357 --> 01:00:13.756
Don't you have some
generic forms lyin' around,

01:00:13.758 --> 01:00:15.325
like divorcezoom.com?

01:00:15.327 --> 01:00:16.694
Generic forms?

01:00:17.996 --> 01:00:20.797
Every divorce is unique.

01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:24.803
Regardless of race, religion
or sexual preference.

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:27.870
Now how would you
like to handle my fee?

01:00:27.872 --> 01:00:29.072
We'll split it.

01:00:29.074 --> 01:00:32.709
You got that much or do
you need to get another loan?

01:00:32.711 --> 01:00:36.681
You're sure Thursday's
the best you can do?

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:42.054
So, where you staying?

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:45.788
What?

01:00:45.790 --> 01:00:46.923
It's my apartment.

01:00:46.925 --> 01:00:50.294
I gave up my job, my home
and best friend for you.

01:00:50.296 --> 01:00:53.263
I'm not leaving the apartment
and I'm not paying you rent.

01:00:53.265 --> 01:00:57.267
Well, you'd better start
cooking or cleaning or,

01:00:57.269 --> 01:00:58.168
doing something.

01:00:58.170 --> 01:00:59.803
Asshole!

01:00:59.805 --> 01:01:01.240
And your car sucks!

01:01:36.343 --> 01:01:37.741
I'm so sorry Char.

01:01:37.743 --> 01:01:39.343
Men are such turds.

01:02:02.035 --> 01:02:04.001
So, then you wanna
subtract the top number

01:02:04.003 --> 01:02:06.504
from the other one
you got right there.

01:02:06.506 --> 01:02:07.372
Okay.

01:02:07.374 --> 01:02:08.940
You go it!

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:10.645
Awesome, good job!

01:02:44.178 --> 01:02:47.513
Have a great
day in your work.

01:02:47.515 --> 01:02:48.382
Love you.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.896
No, I haven't done much

01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:06.198
any animated porn but
I am a fast learner

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.467
and I love animation,

01:03:08.469 --> 01:03:10.238
and porn, so win-win.

01:03:11.539 --> 01:03:13.372
Okay, well please
keep me in mind.

01:03:13.374 --> 01:03:14.506
Thank you.

01:03:20.482 --> 01:03:22.115
Surprise!

01:03:22.117 --> 01:03:23.250
Happy Birthday!

01:03:23.252 --> 01:03:25.918
Happy birthday, son!

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.022
Wow, I didn't expect...

01:03:29.424 --> 01:03:30.823
How's the Antarctica?

01:03:30.825 --> 01:03:31.824
Amazing!

01:03:31.826 --> 01:03:33.058
Your mother was the hero.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.894
She devised a scheme to foul
the prop on the Nisshin Maru.

01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:37.029
And your father
was shot in the balls

01:03:37.031 --> 01:03:39.098
by one of the
Japanese deckhands.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.199
With a rubber bullet.

01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:41.967
It swelled up like coconuts.

01:03:41.969 --> 01:03:44.571
I've got a lovely
bunch of coconuts.

01:03:44.573 --> 01:03:45.872
Lookin' good boy.

01:03:45.874 --> 01:03:47.173
So good to see you.

01:03:47.175 --> 01:03:49.211
Yeah, so good.

01:03:57.586 --> 01:03:58.585
Hey, what'd you tell them?

01:03:58.587 --> 01:03:59.586
About what?

01:03:59.588 --> 01:04:01.388
About us, about the divorce.

01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:02.455
When?

01:04:02.457 --> 01:04:03.390
They haven't stopped
talking since they got here.

01:04:03.392 --> 01:04:04.559
Oh, thank god.

01:04:05.893 --> 01:04:07.159
You're gonna
have to tell them.

01:04:07.161 --> 01:04:09.363
Well, not tonight,
it's my birthday.

01:04:09.365 --> 01:04:10.864
Plus it's humiliating.

01:04:10.866 --> 01:04:12.299
They're marriage
has lasted 32 years

01:04:12.301 --> 01:04:16.936
and ours lasted about as
long as a Hobbit movie.

01:04:16.938 --> 01:04:18.539
Happy birthday, son.

01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:22.075
My charitable works
continue, I see.

01:04:22.077 --> 01:04:23.610
What's this?

01:04:23.612 --> 01:04:27.547
Two tickets to Tahiti for an
all inclusive stay at Brando.

01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:29.649
It's a luxury eco-resort.

01:04:29.651 --> 01:04:33.054
I could have been a contender.

01:04:33.056 --> 01:04:34.555
Because my boy and
his beautiful bride

01:04:34.557 --> 01:04:39.095
deserve the absolute best
honeymoon the money can buy.

01:04:40.663 --> 01:04:41.595
Speaking of honeymoons,

01:04:41.597 --> 01:04:43.897
you know your father
and I are undergoing

01:04:43.899 --> 01:04:46.032
a bit of a second one right now.

01:04:46.034 --> 01:04:48.469
Let's just say, we're
experiencing a refreshed sense

01:04:48.471 --> 01:04:50.571
of sexual energy.

01:04:50.573 --> 01:04:53.406
Exploring our aging bodies.

01:04:53.408 --> 01:04:56.946
So many delicious new
cavities to explore.

01:04:59.482 --> 01:05:00.981
Well, it's a very
thoughtful gift

01:05:00.983 --> 01:05:03.918
and I thank you very much.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.453
It's thoughtful,
isn't it, Charlotte?

01:05:05.455 --> 01:05:07.955
Yeah, yeah, thank you so much.

01:05:07.957 --> 01:05:09.390
Okay, let's have a photo.

01:05:09.392 --> 01:05:11.160
Hold up your present.

01:05:14.297 --> 01:05:16.330
This isn't the Middle
East peace talks.

01:05:16.332 --> 01:05:17.567
How about a kiss?

01:05:23.374 --> 01:05:24.241
Lovely.

01:05:37.588 --> 01:05:40.988
I'm sensing a little
bit of disharmony.

01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:42.656
I'm sorry, I'm
just feeling a bit...

01:05:42.658 --> 01:05:45.427
Yeah, I know, is it Brandon?

01:05:45.429 --> 01:05:46.595
You know, because
he's a sweet boy

01:05:46.597 --> 01:05:48.730
but he can also be a
massive pain in the ass.

01:05:48.732 --> 01:05:50.401
Trust me, I know.

01:05:51.969 --> 01:05:52.634
It's not just him.

01:05:52.636 --> 01:05:54.736
It's just that we,

01:05:54.738 --> 01:05:58.707
you know, we both weren't as
honest as we should have been.

01:05:58.709 --> 01:05:59.576
Ah.

01:06:02.446 --> 01:06:05.649
Well, I remember
when Jerry and I met.

01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:10.586
He thought I was a
democrat and a virgin.

01:06:11.523 --> 01:06:15.090
The truth is, I was
in love with Reagan

01:06:15.092 --> 01:06:18.661
and I'd slept with half the
boys in the neighborhood.

01:06:18.663 --> 01:06:20.462
So, you?

01:06:20.464 --> 01:06:24.766
Well, I told him what I
thought he wanted to hear

01:06:24.768 --> 01:06:27.769
which was not the truth, I...

01:06:27.771 --> 01:06:28.703
You...

01:06:28.705 --> 01:06:31.241
Lied, yes, guilty as charged.

01:06:32.377 --> 01:06:36.245
But when I met him, I
knew he was special.

01:06:36.247 --> 01:06:40.616
So all of this nonsense just
came babbling out of me.

01:06:40.618 --> 01:06:42.552
And how did you?

01:06:42.554 --> 01:06:45.020
I eventually found the courage

01:06:45.022 --> 01:06:49.059
to tell him what was in
my head and in my heart.

01:06:50.394 --> 01:06:52.595
And that's been the
glue of our relationship

01:06:52.597 --> 01:06:55.096
from that day forward.

01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:56.767
You sure you don't
want some of this?

01:06:56.769 --> 01:06:58.234
It's Peruvian hog's breath.

01:06:58.236 --> 01:07:00.203
They grow it above three line.

01:07:00.205 --> 01:07:01.471
Sweet.

01:07:01.473 --> 01:07:04.106
Nah, I'm good, thanks, Dad.

01:07:04.108 --> 01:07:06.411
I'm not really in the mood.

01:07:07.345 --> 01:07:09.612
Why so glum, Sunny Jim?

01:07:09.614 --> 01:07:11.681
I don't know, Dad.

01:07:11.683 --> 01:07:13.151
Marriage is hard.

01:07:16.521 --> 01:07:20.290
You have a keen
grasp of the obvious.

01:07:20.292 --> 01:07:24.497
I think mine was just a
bad idea from the start.

01:07:25.664 --> 01:07:29.735
Brandon, not a day goes
by that I don't ask myself,

01:07:31.236 --> 01:07:34.771
did I do the right thing
marrying that woman?

01:07:34.773 --> 01:07:38.207
That's not very romantic, Dad.

01:07:38.209 --> 01:07:41.412
It is when the
answer is always yes.

01:08:09.609 --> 01:08:10.744
Oh, my god.

01:08:25.624 --> 01:08:28.492
Oh,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:08:52.251 --> 01:08:53.283
Sweetie, what's wrong?

01:08:53.285 --> 01:08:54.251
Are you okay?

01:08:54.252 --> 01:08:55.618
Yeah, Mom, I know, I'm fine.

01:08:55.621 --> 01:08:57.388
I just have a
headache, that's all.

01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:59.357
I think I
have something for that.

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:01.626
Well, you've always got
somethin' for somethin'.

01:09:01.627 --> 01:09:04.828
Great, why do you
have a DEA property room

01:09:04.831 --> 01:09:06.296
around your waist?

01:09:06.299 --> 01:09:07.465
SCHWEITZER POLIZEI
FRAU: Oh, I would love

01:09:07.466 --> 01:09:08.633
to make this bust.

01:09:08.635 --> 01:09:12.403
Window Pane acid, peyote,
shrooms, mescaline, ecstasy,

01:09:12.404 --> 01:09:14.639
hashish and Viagra.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.341
It's our mobile first aid kit.

01:09:16.343 --> 01:09:18.676
Recently replenished
in Tierra del Fuego.

01:09:18.678 --> 01:09:20.613
You know, they have a
very enlightened attitude

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.483
towards psychotropics.

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:24.451
Here it is.

01:09:25.251 --> 01:09:26.752
Ginger root.

01:09:26.754 --> 01:09:29.787
Yeah, Dad, don't
you have any Advil?

01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:30.658
Advil.

01:09:31.859 --> 01:09:33.728
That's fuckin' poison.

01:09:36.696 --> 01:09:38.563
Ow, shit!

01:09:38.564 --> 01:09:39.432
Ow, god.

01:09:41.234 --> 01:09:42.466
What?

01:09:42.469 --> 01:09:43.701
Good
morning, Charlotte,

01:09:43.703 --> 01:09:46.205
this is Bonnie Newton from the
Culver City Charter School.

01:09:46.207 --> 01:09:47.707
Is this a good time?

01:09:48.743 --> 01:09:51.343
Yeah, yeah, definitely, hi.

01:09:51.345 --> 01:09:53.211
Good, well,
we're having a gathering

01:09:53.212 --> 01:09:54.980
this afternoon with
some of the board.

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:57.516
I thought it might help
your cause if you attended

01:09:57.518 --> 01:09:59.818
and demonstrated to
everyone what a solid,

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.520
upstanding, young woman you are.

01:10:01.522 --> 01:10:04.489
Yeah, I would
love to, thank you.

01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:05.724
Well, we
West Virginia gals

01:10:05.726 --> 01:10:07.693
have to stick together.

01:10:08.797 --> 01:10:09.696
I'll email you the details.

01:10:09.698 --> 01:10:11.430
Okay, great.

01:10:11.432 --> 01:10:12.766
Oh, and
bring that charming

01:10:12.768 --> 01:10:14.934
and supportive husband of yours.

01:10:14.936 --> 01:10:17.403
Yeah, of course,
thank you, yeah.

01:10:17.405 --> 01:10:19.238
I'll will see you there, thanks.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.508
Bye.

01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:25.577
First, you want me
to tell my parents

01:10:25.579 --> 01:10:28.280
we're getting divorced
and now, you want me to go

01:10:28.282 --> 01:10:31.850
to a garden party and pretend
we're happily married?

01:10:31.852 --> 01:10:33.520
Brandon, just please.

01:10:33.522 --> 01:10:35.755
If I get this job, then
I'll have enough money

01:10:35.757 --> 01:10:37.324
and I can move out.

01:10:38.593 --> 01:10:39.428
Okay.

01:10:40.529 --> 01:10:42.494
That makes sense.

01:10:42.496 --> 01:10:44.766
So nice to see you again.

01:10:46.768 --> 01:10:47.599
Oh, Charlotte.

01:10:47.601 --> 01:10:48.567
Hi.

01:10:48.569 --> 01:10:49.668
So glad you
could make it, dear.

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:50.737
Thank you for having us.

01:10:50.739 --> 01:10:51.704
You're welcome.

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:53.639
Mrs. Newton, this
is my husband Brandon.

01:10:53.641 --> 01:10:54.841
Very nice to meet you.

01:10:54.843 --> 01:10:57.277
And this is our host
and head of the board,

01:10:57.279 --> 01:10:59.713
Dr. Glenn Wooster and his
mother,

01:10:59.715 --> 01:11:03.418
- Lilian Cavendish Wooster.
- Nice to meet you.

01:11:09.558 --> 01:11:10.790
You know, Charlotte has
been teaching first grade

01:11:10.792 --> 01:11:12.759
for over eight years.

01:11:12.761 --> 01:11:13.927
You don't find it challenging

01:11:13.929 --> 01:11:15.662
to be around children all day?

01:11:15.664 --> 01:11:18.865
Oh, god no, I just
love kids so much.

01:11:18.867 --> 01:11:22.335
They're so honest
and entertaining.

01:11:22.337 --> 01:11:24.605
I have this one student, Emily,

01:11:24.607 --> 01:11:26.372
every day, anywhere she went,

01:11:26.374 --> 01:11:28.641
she always had her two
Barbie dolls at her side.

01:11:28.643 --> 01:11:30.710
And on her birthday, I
asked her what she wanted

01:11:30.712 --> 01:11:32.779
and she told me, she
want more Barbies.

01:11:32.781 --> 01:11:34.547
And so I asked
Emily, I was like,

01:11:34.549 --> 01:11:36.050
well, you already have
Barbies, why do you need more?

01:11:36.052 --> 01:11:38.718
And he said, because my
Barbies smoke and drink

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.654
way too much.

01:11:46.095 --> 01:11:46.927
Excuse me.

01:11:46.929 --> 01:11:48.362
Sure.

01:11:48.364 --> 01:11:49.730
So I just, I don't know.

01:11:49.732 --> 01:11:51.465
They are so much fun
and you never know

01:11:51.467 --> 01:11:53.734
what they're gonna
say or do next.

01:11:53.736 --> 01:11:56.504
Brandon, I
bear good tidings.

01:11:56.506 --> 01:11:58.806
I just got you a full-time
gig working with me

01:11:58.808 --> 01:12:01.709
over here at Plan C,
as promised, buddy.

01:12:01.711 --> 01:12:03.677
Now, please go find a toilet,

01:12:03.679 --> 01:12:04.945
lest you shit yourself with joy

01:12:04.947 --> 01:12:06.679
when I tell you how much
you're getting paid.

01:12:06.681 --> 01:12:07.849
Okay, bye.

01:12:13.456 --> 01:12:14.789
It was so great to meet you.

01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:15.623
Good luck.

01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:16.457
Thank you.

01:12:16.459 --> 01:12:17.092
Hey.

01:12:17.094 --> 01:12:17.925
Hey.

01:12:17.927 --> 01:12:19.027
Got you a beer.

01:12:19.029 --> 01:12:19.896
Thanks.

01:12:21.864 --> 01:12:25.099
You know, I really
don't like beer.

01:12:25.101 --> 01:12:25.933
Really?

01:12:25.935 --> 01:12:26.803
Yeah.

01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:30.004
Neither do I.

01:12:30.006 --> 01:12:31.806
SCHWEITZER POLIZEI
FRAU: At last the truth.

01:12:31.808 --> 01:12:34.812
American beers
taste like shizer.

01:12:39.448 --> 01:12:41.549
Mr. Wooster, I don't
know what the philosophy

01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:43.118
of your school is
but my wife and I

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.821
are big supporters
of constructivism.

01:12:45.823 --> 01:12:47.755
Yes, you know, we
really like the notion

01:12:47.757 --> 01:12:49.891
that the teacher are
facilitating the students

01:12:49.893 --> 01:12:51.826
to interact among themselves.

01:12:51.828 --> 01:12:53.694
Instead of merely
lecturing at them

01:12:53.696 --> 01:12:56.999
as they sit and becoming
passive listeners.

01:12:57.001 --> 01:12:58.567
And having the
students realize

01:12:58.569 --> 01:13:01.503
that everyone has
something to contribute.

01:13:01.505 --> 01:13:03.638
Everyone has a value.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.141
You must have
read our website.

01:13:06.143 --> 01:13:08.844
No, we have a son
who attended a school

01:13:08.846 --> 01:13:10.645
that was based on
constructivism.

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:15.416
And we could not be happier
with the way he turned out.

01:13:15.418 --> 01:13:16.086
Cheers.

01:13:21.693 --> 01:13:23.826
I think you made a
very good impression.

01:13:23.828 --> 01:13:25.161
Thank you so much.

01:13:25.163 --> 01:13:26.761
You're welcome, keep it up.

01:13:26.763 --> 01:13:30.632
And by the way, your
in-laws are fabulous.

01:13:30.634 --> 01:13:32.001
Yeah, they're something.

01:13:32.003 --> 01:13:33.102
Oh, my daughter's here!

01:13:33.104 --> 01:13:34.603
She's visiting from Morgantown.

01:13:34.605 --> 01:13:35.670
Hi, honey.

01:13:35.672 --> 01:13:36.571
Hey, Mom.

01:13:36.573 --> 01:13:37.839
Hi, sweetie.

01:13:37.841 --> 01:13:40.075
Charlotte Conroy, I'd like to
introduce you to my daughter,

01:13:40.077 --> 01:13:42.644
Anais, and her husband, Steven.

01:13:42.646 --> 01:13:43.745
Hi, there.

01:13:43.747 --> 01:13:44.881
Steven.

01:13:44.883 --> 01:13:45.815
So predictable.

01:13:45.817 --> 01:13:47.083
Sex, missionary position.

01:13:50.822 --> 01:13:51.888
Asshole!

01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:53.858
Pleasure to meet you.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:57.929
Purse is in the dishwasher.

01:14:03.835 --> 01:14:06.501
Mother,
this is wonderful.

01:14:06.503 --> 01:14:08.804
So lovely what you
put together here.

01:14:08.806 --> 01:14:10.873
Grilled shrimp?

01:14:10.875 --> 01:14:12.775
I guess it must have
taken you a very long time

01:14:12.777 --> 01:14:14.044
to ride back from Rwanda.

01:14:14.046 --> 01:14:14.913
Ah!

01:14:19.050 --> 01:14:21.486
Sorry, will you excuse me.

01:14:27.025 --> 01:14:29.759
Hey, honey, look at that.

01:14:29.761 --> 01:14:31.962
Let's go for a walk.

01:14:31.964 --> 01:14:33.797
Hey, you feelin' okay?

01:14:33.799 --> 01:14:34.998
Do you wanna play doctor?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.566
Okay, Charlotte,
what is going on here?

01:14:37.568 --> 01:14:38.735
I forgot to feed my cat.

01:14:38.737 --> 01:14:39.604
Oh, boy!

01:14:40.272 --> 01:14:42.141
Charlotte, talk to me.

01:14:43.842 --> 01:14:45.110
Charlotte, hey.

01:14:47.012 --> 01:14:48.278
Brandon.

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.047
What the hell are
you two doing here?

01:14:50.049 --> 01:14:51.114
We came to help Charlotte.

01:14:51.116 --> 01:14:52.815
This is very important to her.

01:14:52.817 --> 01:14:53.749
We know.

01:14:53.751 --> 01:14:54.850
We know everything.

01:14:54.852 --> 01:14:56.053
That's why we come here,

01:14:56.055 --> 01:14:57.721
we don't want you to
make a terrible mistake

01:14:57.723 --> 01:14:59.523
and throw away your soul
partner before the cosmos...

01:14:59.525 --> 01:15:00.123
Wait a second.

01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:01.560
Wait a minute.

01:15:05.064 --> 01:15:06.296
Are you two high?

01:15:06.298 --> 01:15:07.130
Brandon!

01:15:07.132 --> 01:15:07.998
Of course we are.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.666
Oh my god.

01:15:09.668 --> 01:15:10.701
You don't think
that we would turn up

01:15:10.703 --> 01:15:12.703
to something like this straight.

01:15:12.705 --> 01:15:14.871
We've been fighting these
people our entire lives

01:15:14.873 --> 01:15:16.773
with their bourgeoisie
pretentiousness.

01:15:16.775 --> 01:15:18.041
And anal bleaching.

01:15:18.043 --> 01:15:19.777
Would you folks care
for some conflict-free

01:15:19.779 --> 01:15:21.946
Ugandan artichoke confit
on lardo brushed crostini?

01:15:21.948 --> 01:15:22.816
No.

01:15:24.717 --> 01:15:25.784
I'm so sorry.

01:15:36.296 --> 01:15:37.696
Mrs. Conroy.

01:15:38.731 --> 01:15:40.264
How's the new bride?

01:15:40.266 --> 01:15:42.132
Couldn't be better.

01:15:42.134 --> 01:15:44.902
Do I sense
trouble in paradise?

01:15:44.904 --> 01:15:45.937
Not now, Steven.

01:15:45.939 --> 01:15:48.339
Charlotte, this isn't you.

01:15:48.341 --> 01:15:49.173
What?

01:15:49.175 --> 01:15:50.208
What do you mean?

01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:51.378
I am so sorry.

01:15:52.979 --> 01:15:56.781
I hurt you very badly and your
life has taken an ugly turn,

01:15:56.783 --> 01:15:57.817
I apologize.

01:15:58.985 --> 01:16:02.753
You obviously married the
first guy you met after me.

01:16:02.755 --> 01:16:04.055
Where was it?

01:16:04.057 --> 01:16:05.289
A dating website?

01:16:05.291 --> 01:16:06.991
Singles bar?

01:16:06.993 --> 01:16:08.193
Old Navy?

01:16:08.195 --> 01:16:09.163
No, eBay.

01:16:10.897 --> 01:16:12.131
Good god.

01:16:12.133 --> 01:16:13.931
You bought a husband online?

01:16:13.933 --> 01:16:18.002
No, we met online, and then
fell in love and got married.

01:16:18.004 --> 01:16:20.372
And not after 14 years, Steven.

01:16:20.374 --> 01:16:23.674
Not all the changes are bad.

01:16:23.676 --> 01:16:24.711
The clothes.

01:16:25.745 --> 01:16:26.613
The hair.

01:16:28.882 --> 01:16:31.784
Do you think about
me, Charlotte?

01:16:31.786 --> 01:16:34.386
'Cause I think about you.

01:16:34.388 --> 01:16:35.821
Of course, I think about you.

01:16:35.823 --> 01:16:38.625
We spent half our
lives together.

01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:50.902
The whale song.

01:16:50.904 --> 01:16:53.071
The whale song, the mating
cry of the humpback.

01:16:53.073 --> 01:16:54.772
Let's get you into
the house, mother,

01:16:54.774 --> 01:16:57.778
and you can take
a nice little nap.

01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:01.080
How dare you?

01:17:01.082 --> 01:17:02.683
Let's go, mother.

01:17:03.984 --> 01:17:06.787
Oh, I miss your
father so much!

01:17:09.423 --> 01:17:10.823
Steven?

01:17:10.825 --> 01:17:11.692
Yes.

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.795
You're such an asshole.

01:17:16.263 --> 01:17:18.263
Is that all it took?

01:17:18.265 --> 01:17:20.934
You want me now that
I'm with someone else?

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:22.368
There's more to it
than that, Charlotte.

01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:23.836
Oh yeah, really, like what?

01:17:23.838 --> 01:17:25.071
And you'd really better be quick

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:27.173
because my husband is
right outside that door.

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:30.276
And your wife, that poor woman.

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:32.245
I mean, you don't
even understand.

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:36.183
Anais, she is so spontaneous
and unpredictable.

01:17:37.818 --> 01:17:39.985
One minute, we're
snowboarding in Telluride,

01:17:39.987 --> 01:17:44.257
the next we are making love
in a Mexican agave field.

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:46.359
I miss your predictability.

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:49.963
I miss the quiet, boring
times, the unimaginative sex,

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:51.197
all of it.

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:54.236
I never appreciated
it until it was gone.

01:17:55.703 --> 01:17:58.271
Well, it's not coming back.

01:17:58.273 --> 01:17:59.141
Ever.

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:03.278
Hey, hey, I just
got a new job in DC.

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:06.412
Let's leave these two horrible,

01:18:06.414 --> 01:18:10.850
disgusting mistakes behind
and get back to our old lives.

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:13.153
My husband is not a mistake.

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:14.888
Yes, we rushed into marriage

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:16.423
and things haven't been perfect

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:18.459
and after 10 ridiculous days,

01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:21.828
things are just blowing
up in our faces, but

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:24.931
there have been moments,
in between all the lies

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:26.766
and the bullshit where
I've loved him more

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:29.903
than anybody in my entire life.

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:30.906
Including you.

01:18:32.742 --> 01:18:33.843
So it's over.

01:18:35.344 --> 01:18:36.277
Perfect.

01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:37.511
No, Steven.

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:40.813
Hey, I dare you to
kiss me one more time

01:18:40.815 --> 01:18:43.750
and tell me you don't love me.

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:44.784
Ow!

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:45.919
Oh, fuck.

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:46.853
Sorry, Steven.

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:50.123
But as we say in the
yard, I gotta do me.

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:53.159
So fuck all y'all if
you can't appreciate it!

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:54.029
Huh!

01:19:02.539 --> 01:19:04.872
Mr. Wooster, I wanna
apologize for earlier.

01:19:04.874 --> 01:19:06.040
My wife threw her back out

01:19:06.042 --> 01:19:08.542
and I was giving
her an adjustment.

01:19:08.544 --> 01:19:10.811
Anyway, we really
love the school

01:19:10.813 --> 01:19:14.848
and we'd like to make
a small donation.

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:18.920
I don't see how that's
gonna make any difference.

01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:21.389
This is very generous.

01:19:21.391 --> 01:19:22.557
Thank you very much.

01:19:22.559 --> 01:19:27.863
I'm gonna find Mrs. Newton
and tell her the good news.

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:30.265
Wasn't that check for Brandon?

01:19:30.267 --> 01:19:31.932
Our son's not very
good with money anyway

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:33.901
so it doesn't matter.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:36.036
And an investment
in her future.

01:19:36.038 --> 01:19:39.008
Is an investment
in their future.

01:19:48.852 --> 01:19:50.885
Did you mean what
you said in there?

01:19:50.887 --> 01:19:52.053
Yes.

01:19:52.055 --> 01:19:52.923
No, maybe.

01:19:55.325 --> 01:19:56.426
I don't know.

01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:02.564
Hey.

01:20:02.566 --> 01:20:03.698
Hey.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:06.133
Wow, looks like you could
use a little first aid,

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:07.603
my friend.

01:20:27.591 --> 01:20:30.058
All hail,
all hail the chosen one.

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.059
Who said that?

01:20:31.061 --> 01:20:32.528
It is I my lord,

01:20:32.530 --> 01:20:34.130
Pegaverneius Candoe of
the Nexus Space and Guild.

01:20:34.132 --> 01:20:38.634
I have traveled nearly
12 parsecs to find you.

01:20:38.636 --> 01:20:39.602
Okay.

01:20:39.604 --> 01:20:40.935
You
are the rightful heir

01:20:40.937 --> 01:20:42.371
to the throne of Nargathus.

01:20:42.373 --> 01:20:44.540
The star child as foretold
in our prophesies.

01:20:44.542 --> 01:20:46.242
A magnificent creature
of unlimited wisdom

01:20:46.244 --> 01:20:47.976
and breath taking
physical perfection.

01:20:47.978 --> 01:20:48.812
Yeah.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.014
I get that.

01:20:52.383 --> 01:20:53.582
The
great epiphany is at hand.

01:20:53.584 --> 01:20:55.250
Reveal your magnificence
to the members

01:20:55.252 --> 01:20:57.086
of the Culver City Charter
School Board,

01:20:57.088 --> 01:20:59.055
and then the world.

01:20:59.057 --> 01:21:01.324
Let them kowtow at your feet.

01:21:01.326 --> 01:21:02.958
Worship you.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:05.596
Tremble at you your
unlimited power.

01:21:14.205 --> 01:21:16.372
I must tell you how
delighted we all are

01:21:16.374 --> 01:21:20.910
about the substantial
donation from your in-laws.

01:21:20.912 --> 01:21:23.547
Well, they are very
surprisingly generous people.

01:21:23.549 --> 01:21:24.481
Well, I can tell you,

01:21:24.483 --> 01:21:26.182
there's a lot we can
do with those funds.

01:21:26.184 --> 01:21:28.117
Loyal subjects!

01:21:28.119 --> 01:21:30.054
I am your unicorn king!

01:21:31.457 --> 01:21:34.924
By the powers vested in me
through the flames of Asinoff,

01:21:34.926 --> 01:21:39.163
I command you, kneel, kneel
before your unicorn king.

01:21:40.666 --> 01:21:42.498
That guys
I fucking crazy.

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:46.470
The time in neigh,
the season is in bloom,

01:21:46.472 --> 01:21:49.539
I call upon you
subjects to step forth

01:21:49.541 --> 01:21:51.876
and harvest this royal seed.

01:22:02.521 --> 01:22:05.489
Steven, what the
hell are you doing?

01:22:05.491 --> 01:22:08.193
Fair Anais, Steven is no more.

01:22:11.196 --> 01:22:12.866
Your milk has soured.

01:22:14.667 --> 01:22:15.901
Oh, Momma!

01:22:18.036 --> 01:22:22.040
Look upon me as I raise
the imperial scepter.

01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:27.946
Mommy,
that man is nasty.

01:22:29.648 --> 01:22:31.684
Prepare to receive me!

01:22:33.986 --> 01:22:34.719
Bam!

01:22:36.256 --> 01:22:38.523
That has to hurt.

01:22:44.196 --> 01:22:46.131
And, as I was saying,

01:22:48.568 --> 01:22:51.001
could you come in on Monday?

01:22:51.003 --> 01:22:53.336
Oh, we would be honored
to have a young woman

01:22:53.338 --> 01:22:55.641
of your character at
Culver City Charter.

01:22:55.643 --> 01:22:56.775
I'd love to!

01:22:56.777 --> 01:22:58.677
Thank you so much.

01:22:58.679 --> 01:22:59.711
Oh my god, thank you.

01:22:59.713 --> 01:23:00.580
Thank you.

01:23:06.786 --> 01:23:09.454
What in the world
got into Steven?

01:23:09.456 --> 01:23:10.688
I don't know.

01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:11.957
Any ideas?

01:23:12.659 --> 01:23:14.292
Food poisoning perhaps?

01:23:14.294 --> 01:23:18.698
I think the artichoke confit
looked a little sketchy.

01:23:21.302 --> 01:23:24.770
Since there's no dispute
over assets or property,

01:23:24.772 --> 01:23:26.607
just sign and it's done.

01:23:27.741 --> 01:23:31.643
You'll never have to
see one another again.

01:23:31.645 --> 01:23:35.781
That line right there, the
one with your name next to it.

01:23:35.783 --> 01:23:36.650
I know.

01:23:43.122 --> 01:23:47.495
On second thought, I want
the Chinese rocket statue.

01:23:50.164 --> 01:23:51.131
Alrighty.

01:23:52.032 --> 01:23:55.536
If you agree, Mr.
Conroy, we're done here.

01:23:57.805 --> 01:23:59.571
No.

01:23:59.573 --> 01:24:01.840
No, I can't part with that.

01:24:01.842 --> 01:24:05.744
Well, what if y'all
shared joint custody?

01:24:05.746 --> 01:24:08.648
Each of you take it for
a week or two at a time?

01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:11.350
No, that won't work.

01:24:11.352 --> 01:24:14.086
Can you just buy
a second statue?

01:24:14.088 --> 01:24:16.789
That way, y'all can
each have your own.

01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:18.223
No.

01:24:18.225 --> 01:24:20.194
No, it's one of a kind.

01:24:21.462 --> 01:24:23.662
Well bless your hearts.

01:24:23.664 --> 01:24:25.831
I don't mean to be rude

01:24:25.833 --> 01:24:27.699
but I've gotta be
gettin' out to Malibu.

01:24:27.701 --> 01:24:30.235
I'm havin' lunch at Gerard's.

01:24:30.237 --> 01:24:32.672
Try the lobster,
it's delicious.

01:24:32.674 --> 01:24:34.674
And not cheap.

01:24:34.676 --> 01:24:36.743
Can we please get
this thing goin'?

01:24:36.745 --> 01:24:38.611
Hey, don't rush
our divorce, man.

01:24:38.613 --> 01:24:39.846
Yeah.

01:24:39.848 --> 01:24:43.583
You know, maybe we
should get lunch, too.

01:24:43.585 --> 01:24:46.753
Yeah, I mean, we shouldn't
do this on an empty stomach.

01:24:46.755 --> 01:24:47.854
Right.

01:24:47.856 --> 01:24:49.454
Now, hold on a second.

01:24:49.456 --> 01:24:51.724
What about your signatures?

01:24:51.726 --> 01:24:53.191
Damn it to hell.

01:24:53.193 --> 01:24:55.796
The wheels are
comin' off the wagon.

01:24:55.798 --> 01:24:58.899
This divorce is fallin' apart.

01:24:58.901 --> 01:25:02.201
- I blame her.
- It's his fault.

01:25:16.751 --> 01:25:17.884
This ends now.

01:25:17.886 --> 01:25:20.888
I'm getting out of here
and you're not stopping me!

01:25:22.592 --> 01:25:24.525
An so concludes our story.

01:25:24.527 --> 01:25:26.159
Poor Charlotte and Brandon,

01:25:26.161 --> 01:25:28.796
their journey has
taught them nothing.

01:25:28.798 --> 01:25:30.563
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

01:25:30.565 --> 01:25:31.765
Did I slap you too hard?

01:25:31.767 --> 01:25:34.603
Nein baby, it was just right.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:54.122
I see you understand sign
language.

01:31:54.124 --> 01:31:54.718
