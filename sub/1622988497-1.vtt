05:05.428 --> 05:07.897
I'm Senior Detective Jones.

05:07.930 --> 05:11.234
You've met Miss Rosenthal,
Social Services.

05:13.070 --> 05:14.872
Under the law,

05:14.904 --> 05:17.407
questioning anyone under
the age of 18,

05:17.440 --> 05:19.175
must be accompanied by
such a person

05:19.209 --> 05:21.845
in the absence of legal
counsel.

05:21.877 --> 05:25.082
Yet, anything you do say

05:25.115 --> 05:27.317
can be used as evidence.
Do you understand?

05:30.486 --> 05:32.356
State your full name and age
please.

05:33.856 --> 05:35.659
Akilla...

05:36.892 --> 05:38.928
Akilla Brown.

05:38.962 --> 05:40.664
I'm 15.

05:42.065 --> 05:45.269
We need to know exactly
what you saw.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.976
I saw him fall.

05:53.909 --> 05:56.946
I saw my father... fall.

09:24.487 --> 09:27.925
- What'd the man say?
- Everything is everything.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.260
You're right about
Police Chief whatshisface.

09:30.292 --> 09:32.328
Babylon swooped hard last night

09:32.362 --> 09:34.131
Ten dispensaries got
the lock down.

09:34.164 --> 09:37.300
And I know Hi-Times
was making bank,

09:37.334 --> 09:40.036
so they must'a snatched
at least a mill right there.

09:40.070 --> 09:42.439
Fuckin' crooks!

09:42.472 --> 09:44.507
Did you hear what they called
this one?

09:44.541 --> 09:46.410
Project Gloria.

09:46.443 --> 09:48.445
Who the fuck is Gloria?

09:48.478 --> 09:51.147
Van Morrison
and The Angry Young Them.

09:51.180 --> 09:53.050
Fuck you.

09:55.050 --> 09:57.020
Benji tell you what he wanted
to talk to me about?

09:57.052 --> 09:59.623
No, boss, not a clue.

09:59.656 --> 10:02.092
I'ma load up, get ready.

10:02.124 --> 10:04.027
Cool. I'll check you
in a minute.

10:09.531 --> 10:10.633
Benji?

10:12.368 --> 10:14.003
Benji?!

10:14.036 --> 10:16.038
Benji, where you at?

10:16.071 --> 10:18.407
Akilla! Come!

10:18.440 --> 10:20.410
Music down!

10:20.443 --> 10:22.179
Tell me what you smell?

10:27.717 --> 10:30.754
Mango?

10:30.786 --> 10:32.555
I had a little taste with
the old lady last night

10:32.589 --> 10:36.292
and ooh-wee, this batch is as
close to perfect as it gets.

10:37.324 --> 10:40.296
- When will it be ready?
- Ah! When will SHE be ready.

10:40.329 --> 10:42.666
Three weeks, give or take.

10:42.699 --> 10:44.534
You wanted to talk to me
about something.

10:44.566 --> 10:46.402
Yeah...

10:46.435 --> 10:50.272
I know we've talked about this.
And crazy as it might sound,

10:50.305 --> 10:53.477
I have a proposal for ya.

10:53.509 --> 10:56.445
I wanna keep the Farm
operational.

10:56.478 --> 10:58.781
Yes, we did talk about this.

10:58.815 --> 11:00.717
Ten years we've been working
together.

11:00.749 --> 11:02.318
Finally operating legally

11:02.352 --> 11:04.154
and you want to shut
the whole thing down?

11:04.186 --> 11:06.089
It's a firestorm out there,
man!

11:06.122 --> 11:08.125
You wanna get caught in it?!

11:08.157 --> 11:10.326
Hey, the government's
the dealers now.

11:10.359 --> 11:12.262
You got enough loot.

11:12.295 --> 11:14.330
You could go off somewhere
wit' your old lady,

11:14.363 --> 11:16.499
see something you never seen
before. That don't excite you?

11:16.532 --> 11:19.536
My garden right here...
excites me.

11:21.537 --> 11:23.406
You don't think I can run
the Farm on my own.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.741
Hey, don't say things
I didn't say.

11:24.773 --> 11:26.509
Look at me.

11:26.542 --> 11:28.512
You close the Farm,

11:28.545 --> 11:30.479
then what do I do?

11:30.512 --> 11:32.581
Our clients know what's up.

11:32.614 --> 11:35.618
There's no going back now.
Understand?

11:41.291 --> 11:43.359
Have you told the Greek yet?

11:43.392 --> 11:45.561
We have a face-to-face
tonight after I make my run.

11:45.594 --> 11:47.196
Hmm...

11:47.229 --> 11:49.332
let me know how that goes.

11:51.434 --> 11:53.570
I got three lamps to replace.

11:53.603 --> 11:55.539
Get Zo on it.
Time don't wait.

11:55.571 --> 11:57.640
Hombre, I got nothin'
but time!

12:01.643 --> 12:04.413
Fuck...

12:04.446 --> 12:06.215
Music up!

14:01.964 --> 14:04.434
Get on your fuckin' knees,
supplier.

14:20.450 --> 14:22.219
<i>Where da fuckin' safe?!</i>

14:22.252 --> 14:23.520
We don't know nothin' about
any fuckin' safe.

14:23.552 --> 14:24.987
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

14:25.021 --> 14:27.357
You see, I know, se, there's
a safe down here, sir!

14:27.390 --> 14:29.425
Wait! Just fuckin' wait!
Just wait! Just wait!

14:29.459 --> 14:32.796
Wait, wait, wait-wait-wait

14:32.829 --> 14:34.498
Gwaan, show me that!

14:41.371 --> 14:43.273
Hurry the fuck up!

14:47.477 --> 14:49.279
You got what you wanted.
Now just take it and go!

14:50.613 --> 14:51.815
Ow! Fuck!

14:51.848 --> 14:53.516
Like what the fuck?!

14:53.549 --> 14:54.951
You got your fuckin' money.

14:54.983 --> 14:56.853
Shut the fuck up!

14:56.886 --> 14:58.655
Sit your bumbaclaat down!

14:58.688 --> 15:00.423
You better step back, Junior,
okay?

15:00.455 --> 15:03.526
Before this gets out of hand.
Just be done, okay? Be done!

15:03.559 --> 15:04.861
Ungh! Fuck!

15:04.893 --> 15:07.464
Shut the fuck up, man!
Shut the fuck!

15:09.831 --> 15:10.866
Cutty!

15:10.900 --> 15:13.570
Oh, fuck! Agghhh! Gawd!

15:13.603 --> 15:15.438
- You have a big...
- Agh!

15:15.470 --> 15:16.639
- Fuckin...
- Agh!

15:16.672 --> 15:18.374
- Mouth!
- Agghhh!

15:25.381 --> 15:27.618
Now shoot this motherfucker.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

15:56.045 --> 15:57.814
<i>Get in the car! Let's go!</i>

15:57.847 --> 15:58.982
<i>We can't just leave him, man.</i>

15:59.015 --> 16:00.917
Drive!

16:43.025 --> 16:44.627
Who set this up?

16:44.660 --> 16:47.030
- Who fuckin' set this up?!
- Aggghhh!

16:47.063 --> 16:48.998
Who set this up?!

16:49.031 --> 16:50.867
I was... I was... Akilla...

16:52.868 --> 16:54.570
- You set this up.
- Yes.

16:54.603 --> 16:56.038
<i>You set this up?</i>

16:56.071 --> 16:58.474
Who set this up?! Nico!

17:00.475 --> 17:03.046
I'm sor... I'm sor...

17:05.113 --> 17:06.350
Fuck!

17:13.088 --> 17:15.057
Red?

17:15.091 --> 17:16.426
- Red!
- Huh? Huh?!

17:16.459 --> 17:17.960
You should go, man.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.829
- Red! Get outta here!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah... okay.

17:19.862 --> 17:21.498
<i>Fuckin' hell...</i>

17:22.565 --> 17:24.667
Fuck...

18:30.032 --> 18:31.234
Yeah?

18:31.267 --> 18:33.068
We got a problem wit'
Acropolis.

18:33.102 --> 18:35.772
<i>WE have a problem?</i>

18:35.805 --> 18:37.539
I need you to come now.

18:37.573 --> 18:39.108
I'll be waiting inside.

18:51.953 --> 18:54.757
<i>Swift like the wind.</i>

18:54.789 --> 18:56.825
<i>Quiet like the forest.</i>

18:56.859 --> 18:59.896
<i>Steady like a mountain.
Conquer like fire!</i>

19:03.032 --> 19:05.869
Rely not on the likeliness
of your enemy not coming,

19:05.901 --> 19:08.037
but on your own readiness
for receive him.

19:11.172 --> 19:12.909
<i>Not on the chance of him
not attackin',</i>

19:12.941 --> 19:16.112
but the fact we have made
our position unassailable.

19:26.889 --> 19:29.158
War is a matter of vital
importance

19:29.190 --> 19:32.027
for the province of life
or death.

19:32.061 --> 19:34.163
For the road to survival
or ruin,

19:34.196 --> 19:37.167
it is mandatory you study it
thoroughly.

19:38.801 --> 19:41.271
Poukisa?! Poukisa n'ap fe sa?

19:41.304 --> 19:44.274
War is a matter of vital
importance

19:44.306 --> 19:46.575
for the province of life
or death.

19:46.609 --> 19:48.111
He's a boy!

19:54.182 --> 19:55.117
Stop!

19:55.151 --> 19:56.686
Me no ask you!

19:56.719 --> 19:58.720
The boy no belong to you
and no belong to me!

19:58.754 --> 20:01.690
Him belong to Garrison Army!
So shut your rhaatid!

20:01.723 --> 20:03.825
<i>Move from me...</i>

20:03.859 --> 20:05.728
I say move!

20:14.937 --> 20:16.673
You ready for be a man?

21:16.097 --> 21:18.267
Well... what happened?

21:18.299 --> 21:20.702
Some yutes got in
and cleaned out the place.

21:20.736 --> 21:22.805
Turned on Nico.

21:22.837 --> 21:24.039
Your boy sold us out.

21:24.073 --> 21:26.142
My boy? I don't do
human resources.

21:27.709 --> 21:28.944
What'd they take?

21:28.978 --> 21:30.212
<i>Everything.</i>

21:41.856 --> 21:43.358
First thing I need
to know

21:43.392 --> 21:45.695
is who took our inventory
and money.

21:45.728 --> 21:47.397
The second thing...

21:47.430 --> 21:49.332
where I can find them.

21:57.338 --> 21:59.875
<i>You get zipped before you
came in here tonight?</i>

21:59.909 --> 22:02.778
<i>Huh? I think you did.</i>

22:02.812 --> 22:05.113
What'd you take, huh?

22:05.146 --> 22:06.749
Snap? Benz? Coke?

22:08.316 --> 22:09.818
<i>When I'm done with you,</i>

22:09.852 --> 22:12.788
<i>I don't think you'll be smiling
so much.</i>

22:30.372 --> 22:31.774
Hey, Zo!

22:31.806 --> 22:32.909
Yeah, I'm still at
the Acropolis.

22:32.941 --> 22:34.376
Shit went sideways tonight.

22:34.410 --> 22:36.344
- What happened?
- Some yutes broke in.

22:36.378 --> 22:37.947
<i>Seems it was an inside job.</i>

22:39.180 --> 22:42.050
Okay?

22:45.520 --> 22:47.255
Yeah, I caught one of 'em.

22:47.288 --> 22:48.356
He's a kid.

22:48.390 --> 22:50.459
Faaak.
What's the next move?

22:50.492 --> 22:52.327
Well, Jimmy's here now.

22:52.361 --> 22:54.197
Gonna find where the yute
come from.

22:56.265 --> 22:58.167
Well, I'll check you later.
I gotta go.

23:03.271 --> 23:04.840
You a tough little nigger
boy, aren't you?

23:04.873 --> 23:06.441
Step off!

23:06.475 --> 23:08.211
We need to get this kid
to talk.

23:08.244 --> 23:10.513
- That's what I'm doing.
- Not like this.

23:10.546 --> 23:12.815
Oh, you gotta be fucking
joking!

23:12.847 --> 23:16.284
Forget who you're working for?

23:16.317 --> 23:19.221
- I'm self-employed.
- You called me to do your job.

23:19.255 --> 23:21.224
Take the bag off of him

23:21.257 --> 23:22.926
and get 'im up.

23:40.441 --> 23:41.844
<i>Let's go.</i>

23:53.823 --> 23:56.191
If you take him, it's on you.
You know that, right?

24:06.869 --> 24:08.938
Now step back...

24:08.970 --> 24:10.405
I said step back!

24:15.411 --> 24:16.845
Aww... fuck!

24:21.417 --> 24:23.486
<i>No!</i>

24:24.953 --> 24:27.356
Wait!

24:29.991 --> 24:32.961
I'm comin' after you,
you motherfucker!

24:32.995 --> 24:35.832
I'm gonna fucking kill you
when I find you!

25:16.071 --> 25:18.641
- That's the thief?
- Well...

25:18.673 --> 25:21.042
Jimmy tried to suffocate him.

25:21.075 --> 25:23.379
- Faak!
- What's goin' on?

25:23.411 --> 25:25.213
Acropolis got jacked tonight.

25:25.247 --> 25:26.882
Akilla caught one of
the thieves.

25:26.915 --> 25:28.583
No shit! And you brought him
here?

25:28.616 --> 25:31.420
- Where else could I take him?
- He's just a kid.

25:31.452 --> 25:34.356
He's got A6G tattooed
on his chest.

25:34.390 --> 25:36.592
You know what that's from?

25:36.624 --> 25:38.460
Meet all kinds of street
level shit in the six.

25:38.494 --> 25:40.196
I can ask around.

25:40.228 --> 25:42.030
What're you gonna do
with him?

25:42.064 --> 25:44.166
<i>I need somethin' to tell
the Greek.</i>

25:44.199 --> 25:45.869
<i>You guys should bounce.</i>

25:47.469 --> 25:48.970
You get Benji home.

25:49.004 --> 25:50.506
We'll regroup later, yeah?

25:50.538 --> 25:52.941
All right.
Keep me in the know.

25:52.975 --> 25:54.410
Anything you need.

26:19.468 --> 26:21.371
Fuck.

26:24.440 --> 26:25.909
Hey!

26:31.212 --> 26:33.516
It's just you and me now.

26:33.548 --> 26:36.184
Hey, your homeboys took some
shit that belongs to somebody

26:36.218 --> 26:38.086
that's not to be fucked with.

26:40.521 --> 26:41.924
Give me a number.

26:43.025 --> 26:44.526
Give me location.

26:44.559 --> 26:46.161
Give me somethin' now!

26:51.767 --> 26:53.302
C'mon, man!

26:53.334 --> 26:56.538
Tell me where to find
your fuckin' crew!

27:15.790 --> 27:18.526
I'm your Brigade Commander,

27:18.559 --> 27:21.029
cell leader of street level
movements.

27:21.063 --> 27:22.565
You report to me,

27:22.597 --> 27:24.232
like your brothers right here.

27:27.769 --> 27:29.704
Ungh!

27:29.738 --> 27:31.074
Ungh!

27:32.141 --> 27:33.575
Ungh!

28:04.640 --> 28:06.642
Shadow say you were strong.

28:11.313 --> 28:14.450
You're one tribe now
before all enemies.

28:16.718 --> 28:20.055
See your blood?
It's from Africa.

28:20.088 --> 28:23.158
Spanish bring us to Jamaica
and name us Maroon.

28:23.191 --> 28:25.795
Them say we "wild"
and "untamed".

28:25.827 --> 28:28.296
But they're not true dat.

28:28.330 --> 28:30.833
You see your grandfather,
Garnett Brown,

28:30.865 --> 28:33.701
was a Maroon skilled
in guerrilla warfare.

28:33.735 --> 28:37.073
From the ghetto slums
him build Garrison Army.

28:37.105 --> 28:39.275
<i>Corrupt politicians used
your grandfather</i>

28:39.307 --> 28:41.844
<i>to influence elections.</i>

28:41.876 --> 28:44.613
The same politrix
your grandfather served,

28:44.645 --> 28:46.315
murder him.

28:53.255 --> 28:54.824
You must understand
self-governance

28:54.856 --> 28:57.725
no matter which side you serve.

28:57.758 --> 28:59.761
Seen?

28:59.795 --> 29:01.064
Yeah.

29:16.311 --> 29:18.781
Take it, man.

29:39.634 --> 29:41.769
Do you think my father had to...

29:41.803 --> 29:43.738
kill people to become General?

29:43.771 --> 29:45.474
What kind of question is that?

29:47.276 --> 29:49.777
Why you not ask him yuself?

29:49.811 --> 29:52.281
<i>Your father does what needs
to be done.</i>

29:52.314 --> 29:55.151
<i>He understands not all soldiers
can lead.</i>

29:55.183 --> 29:57.552
But you ain't got a thing
to worry about.

29:57.585 --> 29:59.122
GA's in your blood.

30:00.588 --> 30:02.424
You ain't gonna be three touch
for long.

30:04.526 --> 30:06.394
What's three touch?

30:08.896 --> 30:11.466
<i>One Touch take a certain kind
of mental.</i>

30:11.499 --> 30:14.269
Loco if you ask me.

30:14.303 --> 30:17.573
<i>Take big risks,
make lots of paper.</i>

30:17.605 --> 30:20.475
<i>One touch control the borders,
get narcotics through.</i>

30:21.977 --> 30:25.547
<i>Two Touch hold down packaging
and try product inventory.</i>

30:25.581 --> 30:27.416
<i>Two Touch keep distribution
flowin'.</i>

30:29.517 --> 30:33.788
<i>Three Touch is responsible
for all street level movements.</i>

30:33.822 --> 30:36.458
<i>That's you, young Jedi.</i>

30:36.490 --> 30:39.527
<i>The bigger you get,
the less you touch.</i>

30:39.561 --> 30:41.497
You feel me?

30:50.505 --> 30:51.940
Yeah.

30:51.973 --> 30:53.275
Bring me the fuckin' kid.

30:54.575 --> 30:55.844
I can't do that.

30:55.876 --> 30:57.412
What you done is create
disorder.

30:57.446 --> 30:59.348
So stop fuckin' around.

30:59.381 --> 31:01.417
The Geek wants you to bring
the boy in.

31:01.450 --> 31:03.552
So bring him in
so I can do my job.

31:03.584 --> 31:06.354
Tell the Greek
I'm doing this my way.

31:06.388 --> 31:08.424
I'll be in touch.

31:08.457 --> 31:09.859
Akilla!

31:14.296 --> 31:15.797
Motherfucker!

31:30.478 --> 31:32.614

31:32.648 --> 31:33.916
Ungh!

32:31.739 --> 32:33.276
C'mon...

32:41.615 --> 32:43.985
Don't fuck around.

33:29.029 --> 33:30.598
<i>Akilla!</i>

33:30.632 --> 33:33.936
<i>What's happenin'?
You babysittin' tonight?</i>

33:33.969 --> 33:36.037
Somethin' like that.

33:36.071 --> 33:38.440
<i>Baby boy doesn't look
so good.</i>

33:38.472 --> 33:40.608
- Is he okay?
- He's good.

33:41.843 --> 33:43.411
Hold up one second.

33:49.884 --> 33:52.587
- So who dis little nigger?
- He's a thief.

33:52.621 --> 33:55.457
Him and his crew took money
and narcotics from the Greek.

33:55.489 --> 33:57.526
Oh shit?! Okay.

33:59.728 --> 34:00.962
You know what this is?

34:02.663 --> 34:03.898
Yo, you Area 6?

34:05.499 --> 34:07.803
He runnin' with Area 6 Generals.

34:07.835 --> 34:10.839
<i>Word is they affiliated
with Jamaican massive...</i>

34:10.872 --> 34:12.440
Garrison Army.

34:12.473 --> 34:13.975
You know what that mean.

34:18.145 --> 34:20.582
So you a killa, huh?

34:20.614 --> 34:23.419
You gonna get yourself in
some grown man shit, shorty.

34:23.451 --> 34:25.388
These little baby gangstas
gettin' baby-er.

34:26.520 --> 34:28.156
<i>Kingsway Lions ridin' wit' you.</i>

34:28.189 --> 34:30.758
Just tell me what you wanna do.

34:30.792 --> 34:33.429
Tell me where to find 'em.

34:48.777 --> 34:50.413
- Ungh!
- Oof!

35:20.107 --> 35:22.044
Oh!

35:30.051 --> 35:32.120
Ungh!

35:32.152 --> 35:33.754
Come on!

35:36.957 --> 35:38.926
You got nobody out here, boy!

35:38.960 --> 35:39.995
Where you goin'?

35:40.027 --> 35:41.129
Ungh! Aghhhhh!

35:42.931 --> 35:44.533
Agghhhh!

35:44.565 --> 35:46.100
Where you gonna go?!

35:46.134 --> 35:48.237
C'mon... c'mon.

35:48.270 --> 35:50.906
Settle down, man. C'mon.

35:57.044 --> 35:59.147
All right...

36:01.917 --> 36:05.219
C'mon.

36:05.252 --> 36:07.088
Let's go.

36:07.122 --> 36:08.491
C'mon then.

36:09.723 --> 36:12.093
All right? I'm taking you home.

36:27.808 --> 36:29.777
Stay low.

36:29.810 --> 36:32.013
You don't wanna be seen
with me.

36:59.341 --> 37:01.643
All I need you to do...

37:01.676 --> 37:03.145
is to point out the spot,

37:03.178 --> 37:05.247
then we're done.

37:27.636 --> 37:28.837
Y'all runnin' with
the Garrison Army

37:28.870 --> 37:30.839
and don't know what time it is.

37:30.872 --> 37:33.774
They don't give a fuck
about you or your crew.

37:33.808 --> 37:36.078
<i>I seen the evidence.</i>

37:36.111 --> 37:37.846
<i>You don't belong to this.</i>

37:40.147 --> 37:41.783
Get out.

37:46.821 --> 37:48.623
Who the fuck are you?

37:48.656 --> 37:50.725
And what the fuck are you doin'
with my nephew?

37:50.759 --> 37:52.928
Sheppard, get out o' the car.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.730
Mi say get outta da car!

37:55.763 --> 37:57.298
You don't see me callin'
your phone?!

38:03.705 --> 38:05.373
Did you do dis?

38:05.406 --> 38:07.908
- Did you do dis?!
- Oh God...

38:07.942 --> 38:10.078
Eh, I will mash up every
bloodclaat thing

38:10.111 --> 38:11.413
<i>if you don't start talkin',
you know!</i>

38:11.446 --> 38:13.781
- No! Hey, wait! Wait!
- Do not come near me!

38:13.814 --> 38:15.950
- I'm not.
- Do not come close to us!

38:15.984 --> 38:18.687
Sister, you need to chill.
This is fuckin' crazy.

38:18.719 --> 38:22.024
I can't be out here
and you shouldn't be either.

38:22.056 --> 38:23.924
- Where you think you're goin'?
- Hey, what...

38:23.957 --> 38:26.794
I don't finish talkin' yet,
you know.

38:26.828 --> 38:29.197
And what you mean
I shouldn't be out here?!

38:29.230 --> 38:31.433
I'm not goin' anywhere
until you tell me who you are

38:31.466 --> 38:33.768
and what business
you have wit' my nephew.

38:33.801 --> 38:35.970
Your nephew tried
to rob me tonight.

38:36.004 --> 38:38.406
<i>His crew broke into
a dispensary I work for.</i>

38:38.439 --> 38:40.374
They were armed. I caught him.

38:40.408 --> 38:42.076
That's how I got here.

38:42.109 --> 38:44.412
Is this true, Sheppard?

38:44.446 --> 38:46.681
<i>What the hell you mixed up in,
boy?</i>

38:46.714 --> 38:49.316
And you're out here robbin'
people?!

38:49.350 --> 38:52.054
Look, they took money
from the kinds of people

38:52.087 --> 38:55.290
you don't want lookin'
for you.

38:55.323 --> 38:56.991
How much money?

38:57.024 --> 38:58.960
Enough to get somebody hurt.

39:00.761 --> 39:02.230
Fuck.

39:04.799 --> 39:07.036
- Do you know him?
- Who?

39:10.038 --> 39:12.240
Dalton Miller?

39:12.272 --> 39:13.908
Yeah, they call him Cutty.

39:13.942 --> 39:15.944
He lives in your complex?

39:15.977 --> 39:18.046
Yeah, he does.

39:18.078 --> 39:19.714
<i>This is who you're playin'
wit'?</i>

39:19.747 --> 39:21.749
You need to make up a really
good story about how

39:21.783 --> 39:24.286
he got back here because
they're gonna wanna know.

39:24.319 --> 39:26.154
And if it's not really good,
they're gonna turn on him.

39:26.187 --> 39:27.756
You understand?

39:31.426 --> 39:32.795
What's your name?

39:34.328 --> 39:35.698
What's your name?

39:36.765 --> 39:38.299
Akilla.

39:41.268 --> 39:43.037
I'm Faye.

39:44.239 --> 39:46.141
Look, sorry about all o' dis.

39:49.109 --> 39:51.012
Get out of da car.

40:15.169 --> 40:17.938
<i>Have a good evening.</i>

40:26.948 --> 40:28.950
Uh... yeah.

40:28.982 --> 40:31.318
- I have some information.
- What information?

40:31.352 --> 40:34.321
Look, just tell the Greek
I'm coming.

40:34.355 --> 40:36.224
Fuck you! I'm your messenger
boy now?

40:36.256 --> 40:38.492
What information?!

40:38.526 --> 40:40.462
I'll tell the Greek myself.

40:43.564 --> 40:45.233
Fucking guy!

41:08.122 --> 41:12.027
Right there.

42:14.989 --> 42:17.359
Ma?

42:17.392 --> 42:19.027
Sa ki te pase, maman?

42:22.129 --> 42:24.465
Ma, what happened?

42:32.406 --> 42:35.076
Why do you stay with him?

42:43.283 --> 42:44.886
We need to leave, Mom.

42:46.321 --> 42:48.891
I'll get the money
and we'll go together.

42:50.625 --> 42:52.393
Please.

43:03.471 --> 43:06.174
Your father is a product
of the people torn apart

43:08.509 --> 43:10.645
by poverty...

43:10.678 --> 43:12.380
greed...

43:12.413 --> 43:13.681
and political violence.

43:18.419 --> 43:21.256
A man must know his own
weakness.

43:28.562 --> 43:31.632
Yes...

43:31.665 --> 43:33.634
we will leave here.

43:44.712 --> 43:47.248
Bondye,

43:47.281 --> 43:50.085
protect my one and only son.

43:51.486 --> 43:54.656
I know you have a plan for him.

43:54.689 --> 43:57.725
Keep him under thy wings.

43:57.759 --> 43:59.661
Provide him with strength

44:01.194 --> 44:04.165
to escape bondage and obstacles
put before him.

44:08.368 --> 44:09.971
Amen.

44:14.674 --> 44:16.444
Come here.

44:55.283 --> 44:58.486
Akilla, you don't look
so good.

44:58.518 --> 45:00.254
<i>Hungry, hmm?</i>

45:00.288 --> 45:02.190
No, I'm good. Thanks, Athena.

45:04.357 --> 45:07.428
<i>I hope you understand
why Jimmy's upset, hmm?</i>

45:08.728 --> 45:12.067
He does his job,
he does it well.

45:12.100 --> 45:14.302
I pay him to find swift
solutions

45:15.502 --> 45:16.837
for difficult situations.

45:16.870 --> 45:20.374
And that is not our working
correlationship.

45:20.408 --> 45:22.310
When is torturing kids
a solution?

45:22.343 --> 45:23.777
Keep whining.

45:23.810 --> 45:25.546
I remember you whining
when I fucked up your face.

45:25.580 --> 45:27.515
Fuck you, mule!

45:27.547 --> 45:29.283
Mikapedia uh, little boys?

45:30.417 --> 45:32.353
This behaviour will not do.

45:33.721 --> 45:36.424
What is of significant concern

45:36.457 --> 45:38.826
is my 150 thousand
and inventory.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.695
The crew that robbed Acropolis

45:41.728 --> 45:43.598
is called Area Six Generals.

45:45.533 --> 45:47.134
They run out of a housing
complex

45:47.167 --> 45:48.669
north-east of the city.

45:54.509 --> 45:56.111
What's this?

45:56.143 --> 45:58.080
Everything you need
to find them.

46:02.683 --> 46:05.687
Security footage of tonight's
events is missing.

46:05.719 --> 46:07.589
You must know about that?

46:07.622 --> 46:09.457
I have it in a safe place.

46:09.489 --> 46:11.526
Oh, that footage
belongs to me,

46:11.558 --> 46:13.327
and you need to return it.

46:15.696 --> 46:17.799
And what did you do
with the boy?

46:17.832 --> 46:20.401
He served his purpose.
I let him go.

46:20.433 --> 46:22.504
Malaka!

46:23.671 --> 46:25.540
<i>These Area Six Generals,</i>

46:25.573 --> 46:27.341
<i>they work with the Garrison
Army.</i>

46:27.375 --> 46:28.610
Jimmy should know that.

46:28.643 --> 46:30.579
Garrison Army, oh.

46:31.812 --> 46:35.382
Sounds like a bunch of ghetto
niggers to me.

46:37.718 --> 46:39.888
I need you to mind
your fuckin' mouth!

46:41.855 --> 46:43.524
Akilla, let it go.

46:45.826 --> 46:47.629
Now.

46:50.864 --> 46:52.267
<i>éla, Jimmy.</i>

46:53.868 --> 46:55.570
Fuckin' sensitive.

46:55.602 --> 46:58.305
Come, come. Hm?

47:03.410 --> 47:05.246
Won't you go, get some air? Hm?

47:06.814 --> 47:08.850
Follow the lead.
Go on. Go.

47:10.518 --> 47:12.220
I need to talk to Akilla alone.

47:20.393 --> 47:22.663
It ain't over... between us.

47:24.431 --> 47:26.667
Not yet.

47:35.643 --> 47:37.845
You know the Garrison Army
is no joke.

47:37.877 --> 47:41.348
And I trust Jimmy
can handle this.

47:41.381 --> 47:42.883
This boy,

47:42.917 --> 47:45.420
he cut up one of your employees
with a machete.

47:45.453 --> 47:48.523
He was vicious, without mercy.

47:48.556 --> 47:50.792
As long as there are dreams
where there is poverty,

47:50.825 --> 47:52.960
there is little mercy. Hah...

47:56.263 --> 47:59.267
I remember a resourceful boy,
hm?

47:59.299 --> 48:01.969
Loyal and a lot less political.

48:03.504 --> 48:05.940
What's happening to this boy,
Akilla?

48:05.973 --> 48:07.808
Boys grow up.

48:10.377 --> 48:13.413
You understand my first order
of business

48:13.446 --> 48:15.749
is to protect my investment.
Hm?

48:17.051 --> 48:19.020
So when were you going to
tell me about the Farm?

48:19.053 --> 48:21.022
As soon as I had something
in place.

48:21.055 --> 48:22.522
Oh, and you have something
in place now?

48:22.556 --> 48:24.359
I do.

48:24.392 --> 48:26.828
I filed to discontinue
our cultivation license.

48:26.861 --> 48:28.496
No-no-no-no.

48:28.529 --> 48:31.766
I pulled serious favours
to move that license through.

48:33.466 --> 48:35.669
For the first time
in your life,

48:35.703 --> 48:38.506
your "operation" is legit...
and you cashing out?

48:38.538 --> 48:40.241
The Feds wanna become
the Starbucks of cannabis.

48:41.575 --> 48:43.844
The same government that
destroyed how many lives...?

48:43.877 --> 48:46.847
For what?
Selling a healing plant?

48:46.881 --> 48:48.882
<i>Old players in the war
on drugs</i>

48:48.915 --> 48:51.685
<i>wanna control production
and distribution.</i>

48:51.718 --> 48:53.654
It won't be the last time
Acropolis gets hit.

48:53.687 --> 48:56.290
<i>Corner stores get robbed,
nothing new.</i>

48:56.323 --> 48:59.026
Acropolis will scale to five
outlets

48:59.060 --> 49:01.962
in the next few months and
I will be ahead of the pack.

49:03.797 --> 49:06.334
You know the upside
of our partnership

49:06.366 --> 49:08.435
is very lucrative.

49:08.468 --> 49:11.472
And that is what you
should be thinking about.

49:13.073 --> 49:15.542
I'm thinking about
evolution...

49:17.444 --> 49:18.879
how it favours the adaptable,

49:20.580 --> 49:21.982
not the strong.

50:06.527 --> 50:09.664
These fuckin' spicks got rat
traps the size of Coney Island.

50:09.696 --> 50:11.498
See the boy Rodrigo,

50:11.531 --> 50:13.533
he owes seven grand.

50:13.567 --> 50:15.536
And I need you to collect
in full.

50:15.569 --> 50:17.705
Am I goin' in alone?

50:17.738 --> 50:19.107
What?

50:19.140 --> 50:20.975
You need me to hold your
fuckin' hand?

50:21.007 --> 50:23.977
Look, if shit gets hectic,

50:24.011 --> 50:26.681
make it out that door
and I got you.

50:58.578 --> 51:00.781
What do you want?

51:00.814 --> 51:03.083
I'm here to see Rodrigo.

51:30.810 --> 51:33.613
Puta. That cucaracha
disrespects me

51:33.647 --> 51:35.750
sending this mocoso to do grown
man business.

51:35.783 --> 51:37.518
We mean no disrespect.

51:38.785 --> 51:40.854
Shadow just doesn't want
no heat,

51:40.888 --> 51:42.824
that's why he sent me.

51:42.857 --> 51:45.560
And who the fuck are you?

51:45.593 --> 51:47.094
Akilla.

51:51.031 --> 51:53.468
Like Achilles?

51:53.500 --> 51:55.136
You gotta read more, mocoso.

51:56.636 --> 51:58.071
"Let me not then die
ingloriously

51:58.105 --> 52:00.107
and without struggle..."

52:00.140 --> 52:02.676
"...but let me do some
great thing

52:02.710 --> 52:05.680
that shall be told among men
hereafter..."

52:05.712 --> 52:07.147
I read.

52:08.882 --> 52:11.118
So what message
do you have for me?

52:11.151 --> 52:13.553
If you have a problem
with our arrangement,

52:13.587 --> 52:15.989
my father would like you to
take it up with him personally.

52:16.022 --> 52:17.658
Your father?

52:17.690 --> 52:19.526
Clinton Brown.

52:19.560 --> 52:21.027
The General?

52:21.060 --> 52:22.896
No kidding.

52:22.930 --> 52:24.966
<i>Seven grand is owing.</i>

52:24.998 --> 52:27.067
Plus another three in interest.

52:27.100 --> 52:29.470
- Ten total.
- Interest?

52:30.870 --> 52:32.573
I'm just the messenger.

52:32.605 --> 52:34.274
And what if I don't have it?

52:34.308 --> 52:37.245
If I leave here
with out full payment,

52:38.779 --> 52:41.015
I can't anticipate
how my father will react.

52:42.283 --> 52:45.018
But you probably have
a better idea than I do.

52:54.127 --> 52:57.531
Threatening your allies
is not good for business. Si?

52:59.033 --> 53:00.668
Shadow should learn that.

53:08.107 --> 53:09.643
Ten grand, right?

53:11.978 --> 53:13.881
Aren't you gonna count
the money?

53:15.815 --> 53:17.852
Why would I need to count
the money?

53:32.632 --> 53:33.868
One more thing...

53:35.768 --> 53:38.573
you will be doing business
with me from now on.

53:38.605 --> 53:40.140
No one else.

53:40.174 --> 53:41.809
Okay, mi hijo,

53:41.841 --> 53:43.710
let's see what you can do.

54:00.794 --> 54:02.596
So what did the grease
monkey say?

54:04.765 --> 54:08.169
Seven grand. Paid in full.

54:09.937 --> 54:11.839
You counted it?

54:13.741 --> 54:16.243
Also, um...

54:16.276 --> 54:19.013
Rodrigo said that he will only
be doin' business

54:19.046 --> 54:20.814
with me from now on.

54:20.848 --> 54:23.785
He said that?

54:47.073 --> 54:48.609
A you this.

54:54.214 --> 54:55.382
Take courage.

54:59.252 --> 55:01.354
A General who is not courageous

55:01.388 --> 55:03.257
is incapable of conquering
doubt,

55:04.692 --> 55:06.694
or create great plan.

55:24.143 --> 55:25.946
Heh...

55:30.718 --> 55:33.053
Hey... you got me or what?

56:24.171 --> 56:25.473
Hello...

56:25.506 --> 56:27.709
<i>Faye?</i>

56:29.076 --> 56:31.512
They took Sheppard!

56:31.544 --> 56:33.379
I didn't know what to do...

56:33.413 --> 56:35.149
- I didn't know who to call.
- Okay. Okay, stay calm.

56:35.181 --> 56:37.317
- I'm on my way.
- I just had to try his phone.

56:37.350 --> 56:38.419
I'm coming to you now.

56:38.451 --> 56:40.020
I'm coming.

57:21.895 --> 57:23.864
I tried to stop them.

57:26.933 --> 57:29.202
They're going to hurt him.

57:30.370 --> 57:32.406
I know that they will.

57:32.439 --> 57:35.243
If anything happens to him,
Akilla, I just...

57:40.446 --> 57:42.315
They're gonna come back here.

57:42.348 --> 57:44.352
You have to leave.

57:45.852 --> 57:47.954
<i>Go get some of your things
together.</i>

57:50.290 --> 57:52.226
Where are we going?

59:00.593 --> 59:02.095
You're safe here.

59:05.665 --> 59:07.535
Please.

59:11.138 --> 59:13.207
Can I get you anything?

59:57.283 --> 59:58.685
<i>I didn't see it.</i>

1:00:00.988 --> 1:00:03.256
Sheppard getting involved
in something like this.

1:00:04.658 --> 1:00:06.594
I might have a way
to get him back.

1:00:12.399 --> 1:00:14.134
This is Sheppard's phone.

1:00:14.167 --> 1:00:16.203
If Dalton's number is in here,

1:00:16.236 --> 1:00:18.004
I have no idea.
It's locked.

1:00:18.038 --> 1:00:19.573
The password is Faye,

1:00:19.605 --> 1:00:21.341
F-A-Y-E.

1:00:21.375 --> 1:00:23.043
Oh.

1:00:23.076 --> 1:00:24.946
I'm paying for it.

1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:29.583
During the robbery,
Dalton killed a man.

1:00:29.616 --> 1:00:31.285
What?

1:00:32.451 --> 1:00:34.421
I have the security footage.

1:00:41.093 --> 1:00:43.096
How-how was Sheppard involved?

1:00:43.129 --> 1:00:45.565
- Not directly.
- Oh Jah.

1:00:47.768 --> 1:00:49.470
Help yourself to whatever
you need.

1:01:19.598 --> 1:01:21.667
<i>Woo-wee!</i>

1:01:46.625 --> 1:01:48.696
Ma?

1:01:52.598 --> 1:01:54.035
Ma?

1:02:04.377 --> 1:02:06.047
Ma! Ma!

1:02:07.513 --> 1:02:09.149
What's happened?

1:02:16.122 --> 1:02:18.425
Okay. Okay.

1:02:24.497 --> 1:02:26.365
<i>MedStar, UMIS,
What is your emergency?</i>

1:02:26.399 --> 1:02:28.301
Y-Yes, hello!

1:02:28.335 --> 1:02:29.670
My mother is unconscious, okay?

1:02:29.703 --> 1:02:31.572
I need an ambulance.

1:02:31.605 --> 1:02:33.407
<i>Okay, stay calm,
stay calm okay?</i>

1:02:33.439 --> 1:02:35.608
- Okay.
- Okay, tell me,

1:02:35.642 --> 1:02:38.344
<i>what's the address?
Where you at?</i>

1:02:59.198 --> 1:03:01.334
It's not finished yet.

1:03:11.710 --> 1:03:13.747
Your little nephew,

1:03:13.779 --> 1:03:15.448
he had a seizure tonight.

1:03:16.783 --> 1:03:18.317
He doesn't belong
with those boys.

1:03:18.350 --> 1:03:20.120
No he doesn't.

1:03:22.321 --> 1:03:24.790
Sheppard has special needs.

1:03:24.823 --> 1:03:26.559
He's epileptic.

1:03:29.562 --> 1:03:32.432
My sister, she was killed
in Jamaica.

1:03:35.268 --> 1:03:37.271
There was a shooting

1:03:37.303 --> 1:03:39.172
and she got caught
in the crossfire.

1:03:41.741 --> 1:03:43.410
It's a miracle how Sheppard
survived.

1:03:45.712 --> 1:03:48.181
But he hasn't said a word
since then.

1:03:50.482 --> 1:03:52.486
What do you know about
the Garrison Army?

1:03:52.518 --> 1:03:53.953
I know who they are.

1:03:53.986 --> 1:03:56.856
They control the little gangs
in Area Six around here,

1:03:56.890 --> 1:03:58.792
from one side of the city
to the other.

1:04:03.529 --> 1:04:05.165
That's Cutty.

1:04:11.837 --> 1:04:13.473
Yeah?

1:04:13.506 --> 1:04:15.642
<i>Yo, what do you want?</i>

1:04:15.674 --> 1:04:17.243
You get my message?

1:04:17.277 --> 1:04:19.346
Yeah, I got your fuckin'
message.

1:04:19.379 --> 1:04:21.515
You took somethin' that
doesn't belong to you.

1:04:21.547 --> 1:04:23.316
Return everything...

1:04:23.350 --> 1:04:25.219
or I send the security footage
to five-O

1:04:25.252 --> 1:04:26.719
and let them deal
with your little crew.

1:04:30.756 --> 1:04:32.357
Where do you wanna meet at?

1:04:32.359 --> 1:04:34.460
I'll text you.
Bring me yute.

1:04:34.493 --> 1:04:36.529
He'll make the drop, understand?

1:04:36.562 --> 1:04:38.364
So that's what's up.

1:04:38.397 --> 1:04:40.567
That's how it is.

1:04:44.504 --> 1:04:46.239
I need to go.

1:04:48.841 --> 1:04:50.509
If anything goes wrong,

1:04:50.542 --> 1:04:53.379
- this is the security footage.
- Okay.

1:04:53.413 --> 1:04:56.884
You bring this
to Athena Kalidis.

1:04:58.785 --> 1:05:00.821
She'll know what to do with it.

1:05:05.392 --> 1:05:07.393
All right. I'll be back soon.

1:05:08.794 --> 1:05:10.463
No, I'm coming with you.

1:05:10.497 --> 1:05:11.732
- No.
- Yes.

1:05:11.765 --> 1:05:13.366
Hey...

1:05:26.980 --> 1:05:28.982
Bring my nephew home.

1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:10.056
Maman...

1:06:12.558 --> 1:06:13.960
I have to go now...

1:06:19.366 --> 1:06:21.068
I promise...

1:06:21.100 --> 1:06:24.637
I'll come back... soon.

1:06:57.837 --> 1:07:00.107
<i>This is Flushing Avenue.</i>

1:07:26.565 --> 1:07:28.634
You shouldn't have put
your hands on her!

1:07:31.703 --> 1:07:33.406
I said, you shouldn't have
put our hands on her!

1:07:33.439 --> 1:07:35.075
Leave me be, bwoy.

1:07:35.107 --> 1:07:36.876
You're never gonna touch her
again.

1:07:36.910 --> 1:07:38.879
We're gonna disappear
and you won't find us.

1:07:38.911 --> 1:07:41.047
And me deliver us
from political violence!

1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:43.016
And me get us out of Jamaica.

1:07:43.049 --> 1:07:44.684
Where you gonna go, eh?

1:07:44.716 --> 1:07:47.153
Think you know shit
about sacrifice?

1:07:47.187 --> 1:07:48.855
Move from me, little bwoy!

1:07:55.761 --> 1:07:57.564
Me say remember...

1:07:57.596 --> 1:07:59.432
"it's not the likeliness
of your enemy now coming,

1:07:59.466 --> 1:08:01.468
but your readiness
for receiving!"

1:08:09.975 --> 1:08:11.911
Hey!

1:09:21.113 --> 1:09:23.549
Your father had enemies,
you know that, hm?

1:09:25.684 --> 1:09:27.920
If they got to him they could
just as easily get to you.

1:09:27.953 --> 1:09:30.924
Detective, this is highly
inappropriate.

1:09:30.956 --> 1:09:33.192
This boy is now under
our charge.

1:09:33.225 --> 1:09:37.063
<i>This boy is the son
of Clinton Avery Brown,</i>

1:09:37.095 --> 1:09:39.899
<i>a particular leader
of the Garrison Army.</i>

1:09:41.834 --> 1:09:43.970
Isn't that right, Akilla?

1:09:46.139 --> 1:09:48.041
<i>Our investigations suggest</i>

1:09:48.073 --> 1:09:50.242
<i>an international crime
syndicate</i>

1:09:50.276 --> 1:09:53.813
<i>is responsible for more than
1300 drug related killings</i>

1:09:53.845 --> 1:09:55.915
<i>across this country.</i>

1:09:55.948 --> 1:09:58.117
And we intend to find out
what we can,

1:09:59.986 --> 1:10:01.787
any way we have to.

1:10:05.925 --> 1:10:07.628
<i>Thank you, Detective.</i>

1:10:09.595 --> 1:10:11.297
This interview is now over.

1:10:12.698 --> 1:10:14.201
Akilla?

1:10:39.291 --> 1:10:41.160
<i>Akilla!</i>

1:10:41.193 --> 1:10:43.596
Akilla, stop!

1:10:58.277 --> 1:11:01.214
Yo. I need your eyes open
for a black SUV.

1:11:01.246 --> 1:11:03.215
I don't think they're gonna
play fair.

1:11:03.248 --> 1:11:05.117
Then we gonna play smart.

1:11:05.151 --> 1:11:06.752
The boy is gonna make
the drop.

1:11:06.786 --> 1:11:08.321
If shit goes down before that,
bring it, yeh?

1:11:08.354 --> 1:11:09.790
In that order.

1:12:23.729 --> 1:12:25.732
Yeah.

1:12:25.764 --> 1:12:27.667
<i>Yo, you see what I see?</i>

1:12:29.234 --> 1:12:31.203
<i>Black SUV at twelve o'clock.</i>

1:12:31.237 --> 1:12:33.239
<i>I can't see shit inside though.</i>

1:12:37.844 --> 1:12:39.813
- Get ready.
- Say less.

1:12:58.163 --> 1:13:00.300
We're here.

1:13:00.332 --> 1:13:02.234
- Fuck you at?
- Watching you.

1:13:04.237 --> 1:13:06.239
You shouldn't put your hands
on women.

1:13:09.908 --> 1:13:11.510
Listen there,

1:13:11.544 --> 1:13:14.046
that cunt got what she deserved.

1:13:16.148 --> 1:13:17.883
Who the fuck are you anyway?

1:13:17.916 --> 1:13:19.486
I'm your biggest problem

1:13:19.519 --> 1:13:21.054
if you don't follow my
instructions.

1:13:21.086 --> 1:13:23.156
<i>How me know you won't
give me up after the drop?</i>

1:13:23.188 --> 1:13:25.524
You don't.

1:13:25.558 --> 1:13:28.194
The shipping container
is in front of you.

1:13:28.227 --> 1:13:30.430
Send the yute there.

1:13:38.270 --> 1:13:40.439
All right, he's in there.

1:13:43.542 --> 1:13:44.810
Time to be brave.

1:13:49.982 --> 1:13:52.218
Here.

1:14:04.563 --> 1:14:06.432
Yo!

1:14:09.868 --> 1:14:11.871
Better get it done right
this time, you fuckin' rat.

1:14:17.510 --> 1:14:19.079
<i>Some time tonight, Femme.</i>

1:14:26.352 --> 1:14:28.188
Gimme that shit.

1:14:32.524 --> 1:14:34.059
<i>Yo, Femme, get the bags,
get the fuck out.</i>

1:15:11.397 --> 1:15:13.332
<i>Shoot that motherfucker dead!
You see him?</i>

1:16:39.452 --> 1:16:41.154
<i>You need to come with me.</i>

1:16:41.187 --> 1:16:42.988
Your aunt is safe.
I take you to her.

1:16:43.022 --> 1:16:44.623
C'mon.

1:16:44.657 --> 1:16:46.392
C'mon, let's go!

1:16:54.632 --> 1:16:56.068

<i>Don't fuckin' die on me!</i>

1:21:45.823 --> 1:21:47.727
I've been lookin' for you.

1:21:47.760 --> 1:21:49.929
Babylon is lookin' for you too.

1:21:52.965 --> 1:21:55.301
My mom's in the hospital.

1:21:55.334 --> 1:21:57.769
So that's where I'll be.

1:21:57.803 --> 1:22:00.872
Yeah. Sorry about your mother.

1:22:00.906 --> 1:22:03.408
So you sorry my father beat

You need to come with me,
Young Jedi.

1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:11.250
Get in the car.

1:22:14.452 --> 1:22:15.921

Stupid fuck!

1:23:08.107 --> 1:23:10.376
You need to come with me.

1:23:17.849 --> 1:23:19.951
"If a man's hour has come,

1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:23.555
be he brave or be he a coward,

1:23:25.491 --> 1:23:27.560
there is no escape for him
once he been born."
