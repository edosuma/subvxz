01:12.973 --> 01:15.441
If I don't have a fire I
couldn't live long out here.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.377
And my preferred way to make
it is with a friction fire set

01:18.429 --> 01:19.812
like this.

matches is 200 miles away

I don't wanna rely on matches
because fire's so essential.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.886
I want to be able to light a
fire with what I can get

01:27.988 --> 01:29.421
right here in this valley.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.723
Here is the set that
I build a fire with.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.226
The thing is some components
of the set wear out.

01:34.295 --> 01:39.364
This spindle for example I make
it about this long to start

01:39.467 --> 01:40.732
and each time I build a fire,

01:40.835 --> 01:42.734
a little bit more
wears off the end.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.069
It gets shorter and shorter.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.770
I need to get a new spindle.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.339
I need to get a new fireboard.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.607
New string.

01:48.709 --> 01:52.010
Plus I need to get material
to build a nest that is where

01:52.079 --> 01:54.980
I cradle the ember
after I get the ember.

01:55.049 --> 01:57.516
And then I'm gonna
blow it into a flame.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.618
First thing I need to
do is make the string.

01:59.687 --> 02:04.189
This is the hide of a caribou
that I shot here and that I ate.

02:04.258 --> 02:08.527
And now I'm gonna use its
hide to make a string.

02:08.629 --> 02:13.165
I'm just gonna make
a straight cut.

02:13.234 --> 02:17.536
Now obviously I got to
get all this hair off.

02:17.605 --> 02:22.641
This is an example of the type
of jobs that require patience.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.394
Not just pulling this hair out
but to build this whole set.

02:25.513 --> 02:28.614
You know, everything doesn't
come fast and easy out here.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.549

relaxing in the sun.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.767
But with all the ice gone, now
we have to just chase out some

06:08.836 --> 06:12.637
seals and hopefully shoot them,
harpoon them and get them

06:12.706 --> 06:14.406

06:36.096 --> 06:38.263
What I need now is some dry
grass and the right piece

06:38.365 --> 06:39.765
of poplar.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.567
And with that I should be able
to build a fire entirely with

06:42.636 --> 06:45.871
materials that I gather right
here, within a mile of my home.

covered in snow.

walking a couple of miles.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.269
I have to be really careful
not to get the grass wet.

07:17.337 --> 07:20.205
It's pretty warm out,
12 degrees above zero.

07:20.274 --> 07:24.843
So if I get any snow on my
hands or in my pocket it starts

07:24.945 --> 07:30.415
melting right away and
the grass will get wet.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.484
And that is bad.

07:35.022 --> 07:38.390
Almost all the trees in this
valley are white spruce.

07:38.459 --> 07:42.627
But the type I'm looking
for, a balsam poplar,

07:42.729 --> 07:44.062
is a very different tree.

07:44.131 --> 07:49.468
And I know an area where there's
a little grove of poplar trees.

07:49.536 --> 07:55.173
Having spent a lot of my time
out here for the last 10 years,

07:55.242 --> 07:57.742
I'm pretty familiar with the
forest all around the valley.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.513
So I keep special spots
like this in mind.

Anywhere there's a resource that
I might need in the future.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.219

see it and then I can get back

12:27.981 --> 12:29.547
There, that's a piece
of wood right there.

12:29.649 --> 12:33.184
<i> (music)</i>

12:33.253 --> 12:35.753
This is the piece I want.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.288
This section in here.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.591
Cause inside this piece of
wood there's a fireboard

12:39.659 --> 12:41.793
and a spindle. I just
haven't found it yet.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.732
There.

12:47.834 --> 12:52.003
I just split off a piece that I
think will work pretty good

12:52.105 --> 12:53.037
for the board.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.941
<i> (music)</i>

12:57.010 --> 12:58.476
You know how I feel out here?

12:58.545 --> 13:00.478
Meditative.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.615
It's just a meditation
working on all these things.

13:03.683 --> 13:06.017
Whether it's taking that
hair out of that caribou,

13:06.086 --> 13:07.418
or just whittling away at this.

13:07.487 --> 13:10.021
It's just a very
meditative activity.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.924
So, I've got my spindle.

13:13.026 --> 13:16.528
<i> (music)</i>

13:16.596 --> 13:20.732
I'm gonna try and build a fire
and cook some dinner right here.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.702
I'm just taking some of the
grass and breaking it up.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.306
Go right in the middle
where the embers gonna go.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.108
I'm getting hungry.

13:31.444 --> 13:45.089
<i> (music)</i>
(drilling like sound)

13:45.192 --> 13:45.957
I've got an ember.

13:49.029 --> 13:52.430
It's just so beautiful
to see that first ember

13:52.499 --> 13:54.933
when I'm drilling
away like that.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.403
It's all dark, and then you
see this little orange glow,

13:58.471 --> 13:59.871
but you don't want
to stop too soon.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.340
You just keep going 'til you
can't hold your breath anymore

14:02.409 --> 14:04.475
'cause all the
smoke's rolling up.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.244
You have to stop
breathing at some point,

14:06.313 --> 14:07.879
and you just keep on trucking.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.748
There's just something
special about these tools.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.150
They just feel great.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.486
I mean, just to think
that you can just take a tree

14:15.589 --> 14:16.788
that's laying under the snow,

14:16.890 --> 14:20.425
and you can make
a fire out of it.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.027
Here's some moose
meat I brought.

14:23.129 --> 14:25.863
I'm just gonna boil
it right in this pot.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.734
For thousands and thousands of
years people have been building

14:29.836 --> 14:31.436
fires this way.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.972
They just stopped
doing that recently.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.173
Most of the time people
have been on earth,

14:35.242 --> 14:38.876
this is how they've been
building fires, you know.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.379
I live this way
because I enjoy it.

14:41.448 --> 14:45.083
I could be laying in a hammock
on the beach in Thailand

14:45.185 --> 14:47.385
if I wanted to be,

14:47.420 --> 14:50.655
but no, I just have a lot
of fun up here.

AGNES: Sometimes we don't always
have money to go to the store,

14:56.663 --> 15:00.898
so we pretty much rely on mostly
subsistence living out here.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.050
This is the seal we just got
back with from our seal hunt.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.588
It takes two, three seals
to make up for the oogruk

15:23.690 --> 15:25.256
but this is a good start.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.359
We can just go ahead and
start taking it apart.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.274
AGNES: You want to try to
keep the meat with the meat,

15:43.376 --> 15:45.710
and keep the oil with the oil.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.079
When you start to mix
the meat with the blubber

15:48.148 --> 15:50.648
that kinda gets rancid
a little too quickly,

15:50.734 --> 15:54.786
so you got to try and do it nice
and slow and careful.

15:54.888 --> 16:05.430
<i> (music)</i>

16:05.532 --> 16:08.900
Now that we're done cutting
up all the blubber and

16:08.968 --> 16:11.569
making little tiny strips
like this, all we do is

16:11.638 --> 16:13.805
put this on the porch.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.407
That way ah every time
we walk around the house,

16:16.476 --> 16:19.344
the bucket will shake and that
will let the bubbles rise up,

16:19.412 --> 16:21.446
and we have to
stir it every day.

16:21.514 --> 16:25.316
And by the next couple of days,
it should be blubber to oil.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.252
And then we'll be able to put
the black meats that are dried

16:28.321 --> 16:32.023
into the bucket of oil, and
then that will preserve it

16:32.125 --> 16:33.358
throughout the summer.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.394
AGNES: I guess I took
most of the blubber off.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.163
All I have to do now
is wash it up, soak it,

16:39.232 --> 16:42.433
so all the blood and the
yellow oils come off of it.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.035
Then we'll stretch it.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.269
Then I'll start tanning it

16:45.372 --> 16:47.372
because we're wanting
to make a vest.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.540
We were wanting to make
it out of ringed seal,

16:49.642 --> 16:51.409
so here's our ringed seal.

16:53.913 --> 16:58.082
A few ribs from the seal and the
black meat that I want to hang

16:58.151 --> 17:01.652
until like tomorrow when it
dries up a little bit more,

17:01.755 --> 17:04.255
and then after
that, I'll strip it.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.657
The first step is to
have this piece dry up.

17:06.726 --> 17:12.597
<i> (music)</i>

17:12.599 --> 17:16.134
And by tomorrow, say
afternoon, it should be ready.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.670
I'm now done with my
seal hunting adventure.

17:19.773 --> 17:21.539
One big bloody mess.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.174
The mess of success.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.611
GLENN: This is the last place
in the world where I could live

17:26.713 --> 17:28.012
this lifestyle.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.747
I enjoy the autonomy it affords.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.849
I enjoy the
confidence it demands.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.619
I like the connection to nature
I feel when I live the way

17:34.721 --> 17:36.287
I do here.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.039

<i> NARRATOR: Glenn recently</i>
<i> harvested a moose,</i>

<i> but now he only has a short</i>
<i> time before the kill goes bad.</i>

18:02.715 --> 18:05.450
GLENN: When I take a piece off,
I have to have some place

18:05.552 --> 18:08.386
to put it where it's
gonna stay clean.

18:08.455 --> 18:12.857
So I'm cutting a few spruce
trees in order to make a rack,

18:12.959 --> 18:15.026
to set meat on.

18:19.399 --> 18:23.201
Making some initial
cuts in the hide.

18:23.269 --> 18:27.572
It's a very heavy hide and it's
very tight on the carcass.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.741
What I need to be concerned
about now is salvaging

18:30.844 --> 18:31.609
this meat.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.745
But, the job's just
getting started.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.722
GLENN: It's all about meat
preservation, meat quality.

19:01.825 --> 19:03.591
That's why it's
important, if possible,

19:03.660 --> 19:06.661
to kill an animal with one shot.

19:09.465 --> 19:10.631
I'm gonna set it right here.

19:14.270 --> 19:16.370
I'm gonna take

19:17.740 --> 19:20.241
And the head of a moose is
well-attached to the body.

19:20.310 --> 19:22.410
These antlers are designed to
smash into another moose's

19:22.478 --> 19:24.512
antlers when they're fighting,
so it's really sturdy

19:24.614 --> 19:25.746
the way it's built here.

GLENN: This meat
has to get cool.

19:50.907 --> 19:54.442
It's very warm in there, and
bacteria will start to decay

19:54.510 --> 19:56.844
the meat from the inside out.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.180
See all that fat?

19:59.282 --> 20:00.214
That's what I want.

20:00.316 --> 20:01.883
If you're not eating a
lot of carbohydrates,

20:01.951 --> 20:02.950
you have to eat a lot of fat.

20:03.052 --> 20:06.320
Because you can't live on
a huge amount of protein.

20:06.389 --> 20:08.322
If you eat too much
protein, you'll get sick.

20:11.928 --> 20:13.895
This is all kidney fat.
Look at that.

20:13.997 --> 20:20.768
<i> (music)</i>

20:20.837 --> 20:22.370
That's really good kidney fat.

wolverine will come along

20:27.744 --> 20:28.676
and eat this part up.

20:29.679 --> 20:35.683
Now the heart, of
course, I'll keep it.

20:35.785 --> 20:38.085
The heart's really delicious.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.721

This heart, I'll carry
home with me tonight.

20:44.127 --> 20:45.660
So the first big
step is accomplished.

20:45.728 --> 20:48.462
I got the guts out,
I got the lungs out.

20:48.564 --> 20:49.797
This meat can cool off now.

20:49.866 --> 20:52.400
And then tomorrow morning,
I'll come over with my canoe,

20:52.468 --> 20:55.002
probably two trips in my canoe
to get it back to camp

20:55.071 --> 20:56.938
about a mile and
a half from here.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.874
So I got no control over
what happens tonight.

20:59.976 --> 21:00.942
I'm just taking a chance.

21:01.044 --> 21:03.978
Hopefully, no bears come
around and eat this up,

21:04.047 --> 21:08.449
because if a bear comes, it will
get all this meat in one night.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.851

is we give our kids as much

21:10.920 --> 21:13.187

21:13.289 --> 21:14.422

over to the far shore.

24:31.053 --> 24:35.656

I got a moose down over there.

I'm gonna use my sled to
move it down to the lake.

this during the night.

the place has left an
indelible impression on me.

Winter is just
around the corner.

35:23.906 --> 35:25.238
I'm gonna hang
that meat up today.

35:25.307 --> 35:26.940
It's not really safe until
I get it up high enough

the bears can't get to it.

35:28.877 --> 35:33.346

35:33.415 --> 35:36.616
This is a meat pole that I built
the first fall I was out here

35:36.685 --> 35:39.786
when I killed my first
moose 10 years ago.

35:39.855 --> 35:43.657
It's about 20 feet above the
ground right here on this end.

35:43.759 --> 35:45.258
It's tried and tested.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.327
Bears cannot get to
meat on this meat pole.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.871
I'm gonna have to go out on
that pole and attach ropes

35:57.940 --> 35:59.372
to hang the meat from.

35:59.441 --> 36:00.874
And I'm gonna hoist the meat.

36:00.943 --> 36:02.642
And I can also use
that line for safety

to help me.

36:20.596 --> 36:22.896
Every time I get up here
by myself, I always think,

36:22.998 --> 36:27.234
"What the hell would I do
if I knocked that ladder

36:27.336 --> 36:29.035
down trying to get back onto it

36:29.137 --> 36:31.171
and I was stuck up here
with no ladder?"

36:31.240 --> 36:35.408
If I fell down, broke my back,
it'd be a slow painful death

36:35.477 --> 36:39.880
lying there on the ground
freezing to death.

36:39.948 --> 36:43.316
This meat is much too heavy
for me to just pull it up,

36:43.418 --> 36:44.651
even with a rope.

36:44.753 --> 36:48.889
When I put my pulleys up there,
I'll be able to position them

36:48.957 --> 36:52.025
here by pulling on this
cord that I've rigged.

36:55.397 --> 36:58.231
Put the cord through there.

37:02.204 --> 37:03.737

Aw.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.060
Start all over.

37:44.129 --> 37:46.296
It's not good that the ribs fell
'cause they could have gotten

37:46.365 --> 37:47.831
dirty if they landed
on the ground.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.633
But it's better those ribs
fell from up there than me.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.534
It's about 20 feet high.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.104
I got to start all over again.

37:54.206 --> 37:57.407
The way I attached it when
I was trying to lift it up

37:57.476 --> 37:58.908
and take that other cord off,

37:58.977 --> 38:01.945
the pin slipped out and
without tension on it,

38:02.047 --> 38:03.647
it wouldn't hold it.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.049
And it fell out,
the meat fell down.

38:06.151 --> 38:21.865

38:21.967 --> 38:24.150
One piece down,
several more to go.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.704
Once I get this meat
upwards, safe from bears,

38:27.773 --> 38:30.573
it's safe for the
rest of the winter.

38:30.642 --> 38:31.641
I'll be able to keep this meat,

38:31.743 --> 38:33.143
because it's gonna get
cold enough here.

38:33.195 --> 38:36.179
It's gonna be frozen in a short
time and the meat will last me

38:36.248 --> 38:37.213

the head up there.

38:44.389 --> 38:47.490
The last load.

38:47.559 --> 38:50.727
The weather got a little breezy
and cooler this afternoon,

38:50.829 --> 38:54.531
couldn't be better
than this for the meat.

38:57.436 --> 39:00.970
I'll be able to leave this meat
up here until next spring.

39:01.039 --> 39:09.913

sand it up and get

it just starts to
separate by itself.

thin strips, spin it, spin it,

wet it, and then it
becomes a thread like that.

then you put a knot there
