00:57.425 --> 01:00.961
So, Becky, is that the
shirt you wore school today?

01:01.061 --> 01:01.895
Yes.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.764
OK.

01:03.864 --> 01:06.800
Would you like
another beer, dearest?

01:06.900 --> 01:10.171
Thank you, my pet.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.405
Can I have a beer?

01:11.505 --> 01:12.306
No.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.377
So, Becky, something
wrong with your food?

01:16.477 --> 01:19.680
Oh, you mean you hid some
food under all this slop?

01:19.780 --> 01:21.048
Hey!

01:21.149 --> 01:23.817
I stuck that in the microwave,
pressed Power, pressed Time,

01:23.917 --> 01:28.256
pressed Start, and this
is the thanks I get.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.458
God, nobody could
eat this crud.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.092
If you don't finish your
crud, you're not going

01:32.193 --> 01:33.227
to get any crap for dessert.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.333
Hey, whoa, it's
your turn to clear.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.268
Oh, of course.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.702
Isn't it always
my turn to clear?

01:41.802 --> 01:44.238
Becky, is there something
you'd like to share with us?

01:44.338 --> 01:45.706
Like what?

01:45.806 --> 01:49.009
Like why you've been acting
like a total snot lately?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.544
Why don't you
just kiss my butt?

01:50.644 --> 01:52.413
Well, haul it on
over here, Jumbo.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.549
DAN: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:55.649 --> 01:59.887
No butt-kissing at
the dinner table.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.022
I'm just sick of Mom
treating me like a baby.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.056
Hello.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.426
What were you doing
in my room today?

02:05.526 --> 02:06.360
Cleaning.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.996
Isn't that what
you hired me for?

02:09.096 --> 02:10.531
I hate that room anyway.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.666
It's such a little baby room.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.235
Don't you hate it, Darlene?

02:14.335 --> 02:15.269
Who cares?

02:15.369 --> 02:17.104
As soon as I turn
18, I'm out of here.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.972
Why can't you
back me up for once?

02:19.072 --> 02:20.174
Well, I don't like you, Becky.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.879
Becky, if you don't
like your room, change it.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.349
You know, we got a garage
full of paint out there.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.550
Your Dad'll help you.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.518
She means your real dad.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.358
You can get
started tomorrow, OK?

02:37.458 --> 02:39.660
Fine, whatever.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.794
Oh, no.

02:40.894 --> 02:44.732
Just seeing your smiling
face is thanks enough.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.134
[music playing]

02:51.071 --> 02:52.506
JACKIE: Well, I did it.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.242
I asked that guy out,
like you told me to.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.142
Yeah?

02:55.243 --> 02:56.244
How'd it go?

02:56.344 --> 02:57.678
- We got a date for tomorrow.
- Way to go.

02:57.778 --> 02:58.679
Yeah.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.214
Only now I have to pay.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.283
No way, the guy pays.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.384
Yeah, but I asked him out.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.953
Well, so the rule is
the guy still stays.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.121
Who made up that rule?

03:08.222 --> 03:09.857
Some cheap, hungry woman.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.061
DAN: What do I look
like, Becky, your slave?

03:14.161 --> 03:15.062
BECKY: So I was a little late.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.163
DAN: Two hours!

03:16.264 --> 03:17.531
And it's your room!

03:17.631 --> 03:20.901
You think I'm gonna spend my
day off painting it by myself?

03:21.001 --> 03:22.970
So what are you going to wear?

03:23.070 --> 03:24.838
I think I'll wear
that burgundy pullover.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.743
This whole marriage/family
thing's been a lot of fun,

03:29.843 --> 03:30.644
but I gotta go.

03:32.880 --> 03:33.681
Damn.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.383
I lose more husbands that way.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.088
Just don't start
with me, Mother, OK?

03:41.188 --> 03:42.456
I've had it.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.624
Oh!

03:43.724 --> 03:44.992
Cover me.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.227
God, it's his problem he's
having this stupid hemorrhage.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.629
I mean, I was just
going to come down

03:48.729 --> 03:51.699
here, get something to eat, then
go up and paint my stupid room.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.000
Oh, no.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.836
Stay down here and fill our
lives with joy and mirth.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.441
Hey, I know what you ought
to wear on that date--

04:00.541 --> 04:02.710
your red blouse with
your black skirt.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.612
That skirt is so short.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.046
I know, but you
have great legs.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.381
And you should wear
your hair down,

04:07.481 --> 04:09.049
too, you know, cause
it'll hide your neck.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.183
What's the matter
with my neck?

04:10.284 --> 04:12.052
ROSEANNE: And make sure
that you order dessert.

04:12.152 --> 04:15.122
Because I was reading in "Cosmo"
where it says that, you know,

04:15.222 --> 04:20.193
a healthy appetite is
considered to be sexy nowadays.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.095
I was so far ahead of my time.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.067
DJ: (YELLING) Mom!

04:27.167 --> 04:28.168
What?

04:28.268 --> 04:32.506
DJ: (YELLING) My head's
stuck in the drawer!

04:32.606 --> 04:33.474
Not again.

04:40.013 --> 04:43.484
God, doesn't she
drive you crazy?

04:43.584 --> 04:46.954
Well, she wants me to be
happy, and she cares about me,

04:47.054 --> 04:49.189
and yeah, she drives me crazy.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.325
Well, I'm sick of it.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.993
I mean, she hates
everything I do,

04:53.093 --> 04:55.796
my friends, the clothes I
wear, the guys I go out with.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.064
Me, too.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.799
Yeah, but at least
you get a break.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.668
I mean, you can just come
here, do your laundry,

05:00.768 --> 05:02.235
and then go home.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.137
Well, you'll survive, Beck.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.540
Look, she's been doing the
same thing to me for 20 years,

05:06.640 --> 05:09.477
and I'm basically
a happy person.

05:09.577 --> 05:13.447
Not saying I don't wake up
screaming every now and again.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.082
ROSEANNE: Now don't
do that again.

05:15.182 --> 05:17.017
And go wash that salad
oil off your head.

05:17.117 --> 05:17.985
DJ: OK.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.920
[laughter]

05:21.121 --> 05:25.726
How does he get his
head stuck in a drawer?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.661
[laughter]

05:28.729 --> 05:30.097
[sigh]

05:31.164 --> 05:32.433
He's gifted, Jackie.

05:35.369 --> 05:39.072
So what color's
this room going to be?

05:39.172 --> 05:42.209
Let's just paint big
black bars on the walls.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.577
I mean, it feels
like a jail cell.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.446
Might as well look like one.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.780
Come on, Becky.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.248
I don't care, Darlene.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.783
Well, then why
are we doing this?

05:49.883 --> 05:51.685
Hey, you don't want to
do this, you don't have to.

05:51.785 --> 05:52.886
You know, one
minute you say you

05:52.986 --> 05:54.488
want to paint the room,
and then the next minute,

05:54.588 --> 05:56.023
you say you don't care.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.059
What is going on
with you, Becky?

05:59.159 --> 05:59.960
All right.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.529
Do you remember Mark?

06:01.629 --> 06:02.496
From down the street?

06:02.596 --> 06:04.131
No, that guy I went out with.

06:04.231 --> 06:07.067
Oh, yeah, the stupid one?

06:07.167 --> 06:07.968
He's not stupid.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.603
He's gorgeous.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.505
I mean, you just wish you
could meet a guy like that.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.974
Yeah, well, if I wait a couple
years, he'll be in my grade.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.050
Well, I'm going
out with him tonight.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.618
Don't you remember
what Mom and Dad said?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.186
Yeah, so they don't
want me to see him again.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.320
So what?

06:27.421 --> 06:28.689
So I'm 16 years old.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.891
I don't have to listen
everything she says.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.427
So if they find out, they're
going to ground you forever.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.163
Well, they're not
going to find out.

06:36.263 --> 06:42.102
Because officially, I'll be at
the basketball game with you.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.303
Why should I lie for you?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.237
Because you're good at it.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.809
I don't know.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.978
Come on, Darlene.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.247
Sisters do this for each other.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.349
I can't believe this guy
is so important to you.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.351
Oh, please.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.888
I'll owe you.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.857
I'll owe you big.

07:03.957 --> 07:04.925
I guess.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.259
Thank you so much.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.728
Yeah, yeah.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.197
[music playing]

07:16.203 --> 07:18.572
Come on, Becky.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.974
Where are you?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.375
[dog barks]

07:25.813 --> 07:26.980
What are you doing out there?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.448
DARLENE: Uh, dropped my key.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.349
DAN: Well, come inside.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.489
Hey, Darlene.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.456
Hey.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.958
Great game.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.793
They beat us by like 20
points, but at the end,

07:39.893 --> 07:43.396
we went and tipped their
bus over and set it on fire.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.365
Where's Becky?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.967
Oh, she went out to get
pizza with her friends

07:47.067 --> 07:48.068
after the game.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.236
She should be home in
like an hour or so.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.008
Hey, genius.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.677
How long were you
at the pizza place

07:56.777 --> 08:00.514
before you remembered
that I had all your money?

08:00.614 --> 08:01.649
Uh, not long.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.250
How was the game, Beck?

08:03.350 --> 08:04.384
It was OK.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.285
Who won?

08:05.385 --> 08:06.419
I-- I just told you.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.489
I just want to
hear it from her.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.424
Well, she doesn't know,
because she was in the bathroom

08:11.525 --> 08:12.926
the whole time,
bleaching her upper lip.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.904
So, Becky, who'd
you come home with?

08:24.004 --> 08:27.975
I hitched a ride with
a serial killer, OK?

08:28.075 --> 08:28.876
Who'd she come home with?

08:28.976 --> 08:29.910
What difference does it make?

08:30.010 --> 08:30.978
We want to know.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.479
God, you're beginning
to sound like Mom.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.747
DAN: Hold it.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.549
If I found that really
insulting, would it bother you?

08:40.153 --> 08:42.122
Come on, Becky, we
asked you a question.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.357
Where were you?
- Pizza.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.258
Quiet.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.594
I'm not talking to you.

08:46.694 --> 08:47.494
Well?

08:47.595 --> 08:48.562
Well, you really want to know?

08:48.662 --> 08:51.298
Fine, I was with Mark.
- Becky!

08:51.398 --> 08:52.199
You lied to me!

08:57.304 --> 08:59.239
This better not be
the Mark I think it is.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.775
Oh, yes, it's the evil Mark
with the fake ID, the one

09:01.875 --> 09:03.010
you don't want me
to go out with.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.813
The one you're not allowed
to go out with, Becky.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.781
Oh, is that so, Roseanne?

09:07.881 --> 09:10.150
DAN: Hey!

09:10.250 --> 09:11.051
Her name is Mother.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.488
And you're grounded
till the end of school.

09:15.589 --> 09:16.389
How's that?

09:16.489 --> 09:17.390
That is so lame.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.226
What are you doing
to do, tie me up?

09:19.326 --> 09:20.794
You know, I've had just
about enough of this.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.763
You are way over
the line this time.

09:22.863 --> 09:23.731
Get upstairs.

09:23.831 --> 09:24.632
No!

09:24.732 --> 09:25.666
What do you mean, no?

09:25.766 --> 09:26.566
Oh, you're right.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.001
I don't mean no.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.137
I mean goodbye.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.253

09:48.789 --> 09:50.891
You don't have, like, a
jealous wife or anything,

09:50.991 --> 09:52.726
do you?

09:52.826 --> 09:54.227
No, none of my
wives are jealous.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.462
[laughs]

09:55.562 --> 09:57.998
Oh, I'll be right back.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.399
Who is it?

09:59.499 --> 10:00.768
BECKY: It's me.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.302
Becky?

10:02.402 --> 10:03.570
I can't take it anymore.

10:03.671 --> 10:04.471
Yes, you can.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.372
Bye.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.810
I can't deal with her.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.278
She'll just never understand me.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.579
Becky, how about
I come over tomorrow

10:12.680 --> 10:14.147
and we'll talk about it then?
- Oh, no, no, I got--

10:14.247 --> 10:16.016
I gotta move in with you.
I've made up my mind.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.820
Becky, this is
not a good time.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.989
Oh, my god, you guys were
just about to, like, do it.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.326
I'm-- I'm really sorry.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.961
I'll just be out in the hall.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.365
Holler when you're done!

10:37.370 --> 10:38.171
Maybe I should go.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.808
No, you sit right there.

10:40.908 --> 10:44.377
Becky, come in here.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.713
Go home.

10:45.813 --> 10:46.947
I can't.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.682
I mean, she doesn't care
what I want or if I'm happy.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.217
She never listens to me.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.686
I mean, all she wants
to do is run my life.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.488
Becky, please go home.

10:55.588 --> 10:58.058
Please, please, please, please.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.492
That's it, Becky.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.830
Roseanne, please,
please, please, Go home,

11:02.930 --> 11:05.632
please, please, please, please.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.234
Oh, I can't believe it.
She followed me.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.601
Now do you know what
I'm talking about?

11:08.702 --> 11:09.737
Well, what did you expect?

11:09.837 --> 11:10.971
Did you think I was just
going let you walk out?

11:11.071 --> 11:14.007
Please, please,
please, please, please.

11:14.107 --> 11:14.975
I'll tell you what.

11:15.075 --> 11:15.876
I'll just go home.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.878
No, stay.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.312
Can't you see Jackie's busy?

11:19.412 --> 11:21.014
You're being very rude.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.515
I don't care if she is busy.

11:22.615 --> 11:23.416
See?

11:23.516 --> 11:24.384
It's just like you said.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.654
She just drives you crazy!

11:27.755 --> 11:29.222
Like you said?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.458
Well, we were
talking about dating.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.592
And--

11:32.692 --> 11:35.362
And what, like you're
some expert on dating?

11:35.462 --> 11:38.999
After all the losers
you go out with?

11:39.099 --> 11:41.101
Bye-bye.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.002
I'll call you.

11:42.102 --> 11:45.205
I'm so sorry.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.574
Well, I hope you're both happy.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.676
That loser had potential.

11:49.777 --> 11:50.911
Becky, you're coming home.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.145
No!

11:52.245 --> 11:53.513
I'm staying here with
someone who understands me.

11:53.613 --> 11:56.483
I have nothing
more to say to you.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.617
I'll be in the other room.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.054
There is no other room, Becky.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.489
Then I'll be in the bathroom.

12:02.589 --> 12:03.356
Becky!

12:06.026 --> 12:06.894
[slams door]

12:13.466 --> 12:15.402
She's all yours.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.536
She can't stay here.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.838
You should've thought
about that before you

12:17.938 --> 12:19.306
opened your big mouth.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.008
But I always open my
big mouth and nothing

12:21.108 --> 12:23.610
like this ever happened.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.378
Bye, Jackie.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.914
Bye, Becky.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.215
You can't be serious.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.718
Congratulations, it's a girl!

12:31.819 --> 12:32.719
[door closes]

12:33.787 --> 12:36.156
[music playing]

12:40.160 --> 12:41.261
Would you look
at all this stuff?

12:41.361 --> 12:43.596
I thought our kids were
supposed to be deprived.

12:43.696 --> 12:44.497
Well, we tried.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.303
Where were you?

12:50.403 --> 12:51.571
Getting a drink.

12:51.671 --> 12:52.873
God.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.542
Well, here, take
this trash out.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.509
No.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.878
No?

12:57.978 --> 13:00.747
Yeah, no.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.917
I mean, this is my room, and
this is the way I want it now.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.085
Wrong.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.586
This is my room.

13:06.686 --> 13:09.222
Because it's in my
house, on my lot.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.223
Those are my chairs.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.724
Those are my desks.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.126
That's my Hello Kitty.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.627
There's my Easy-Bake Oven.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.898
So you take my trash
downstairs to my garbage cans

13:17.998 --> 13:19.532
and throw it out, now!

13:19.632 --> 13:20.433
Jeez.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.405
Right attitude,
wrong daughter.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.677
What's wrong?

13:30.777 --> 13:31.778
Becky's stuff.

13:31.879 --> 13:34.047
Oh, are you gonna get
all weepy on me now?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.515
No, I'm not.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.217
Well, come on, let's
get it over with.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.489
(TEARFULLY) AC/DC,
"Highway to Hell."

13:48.795 --> 13:50.263
I miss her, Dan.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.299
I miss her, too.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.700
You know, we can always
call her and tell

13:53.800 --> 13:55.068
her we want her to come home.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.570
No, she's got to come
home because she wants to.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.939
When's that gonna happen?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.473
I don't know.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.977
Guess we'll wait a
couple more days.

14:04.077 --> 14:04.878
She'll figure it out.

14:04.978 --> 14:05.778
Trust me.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.080
I've lived with Jackie.

14:07.180 --> 14:07.981
We're better.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.922
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:15.022 --> 14:15.989
What are you doing?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.457
Becky's laundry.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.059
How things going over there?

14:19.159 --> 14:20.093
Good.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.361
You and Becky getting along?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.663
Yeah, I'm enjoying
having her there.

14:23.763 --> 14:27.067
We gave each other a facial
and went down to the mall

14:27.167 --> 14:29.102
to scam guys.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.038
Last night we made
prank phone calls.

14:31.138 --> 14:35.608
Crystal's still wondering how
Nancy Reagan got her number.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.910
Yeah, is she going to school?

14:37.010 --> 14:38.478
She doing her homework?

14:38.578 --> 14:39.512
She getting in on time?

14:39.612 --> 14:40.981
She's fine, Dan.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.649
She's really been
a big help, too.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.919
She's making the bed,
doing the dishes.

14:46.019 --> 14:49.256
Oh, well, that is
just great, Jackie.

14:49.356 --> 14:52.292
Well, Roseanne, come
on, not that big a help.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.328
Nothing that a maid couldn't do.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.998
No, no, I'm happy she's
having such a good time.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.199
That way she never
has to come home.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.833
Well, what do you want
me to do, kick her out?

15:00.934 --> 15:02.769
What makes you so sure
she'd come back here?

15:02.869 --> 15:04.304
You are encouraging
her to stay.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.638
I am not.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.874
Then how come she's all of
a sudden acting so perfect?

15:07.975 --> 15:10.610
Because I'm not her mother.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.480
No, you're making it like some
great big damn slumber party.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.115
Roseanne.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.016
I want her home.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.150
Well, come get her.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.051
No.

15:18.151 --> 15:18.986
Then quit yelling at me.

15:19.086 --> 15:19.886
No!

15:19.987 --> 15:20.787
I'm leaving!

15:23.490 --> 15:25.892
Steal my daughter and
then leave me her laundry,

15:25.993 --> 15:27.327
like I'm really going to do it.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.261
[door slams]

15:30.397 --> 15:34.034
Oh, sure, take her side.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.235
What do you think?

15:35.335 --> 15:37.337
I won't wait up.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.938
What are you going to do?

15:39.039 --> 15:41.008
Oh, just hang out, I guess.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.409
No Mark tonight?

15:42.509 --> 15:44.011
Look, I just wanted
to be able to see him.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.279
I don't have to see
him every night.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.448
Well, could get kind
of lonely around here.

15:48.548 --> 15:52.152
You sure you don't want me
to drop you off somewhere?

15:52.252 --> 15:54.021
I'm not going home, Jackie.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.922
Can't stay here forever.

15:56.023 --> 15:56.923
I know.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.058
JACKIE: All right.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.292
OK.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.028
Well, I left the number
where I'm going to be,

16:01.128 --> 16:03.063
right here by the phone.

16:03.163 --> 16:07.367
Oh, and Becky, don't call.

JACKIE (ON MACHINE): (SULTRILY)
Hello, it's Jacqueline.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.818
I'm all torn up inside
about missing your call.

16:25.918 --> 16:26.886
Ow!

16:26.986 --> 16:30.123
Please leave a message
and I'll call you.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.067
Becky, are you there?

16:40.167 --> 16:42.569
Becky, pick up the phone.
Becky, come on.

Oh, come on in, Darlene.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.753
Oh my god, you're
doing homework?

17:00.853 --> 17:01.988
So?

17:02.089 --> 17:03.856
You don't even know
how to run away right.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.526
You're pathetic.

17:06.626 --> 17:07.994
What are you
doing here, Darlene?

17:08.095 --> 17:10.197
Well, I came by to tell you
that you're a major butthead,

17:10.297 --> 17:13.666
and this just proves me right.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.968
Goodbye, Darlene.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.270
All right, all
right, all right.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.206
Um, let me just
ask you something.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.576
What did mom do that
was so horrible?

17:23.676 --> 17:25.712
Everything!

17:25.812 --> 17:26.813
She wouldn't let me see Mark--

17:26.913 --> 17:28.014
Well, you saw him anyway.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.549
- Well, I had to lie about it.
- You didn't lie.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.583
I lied.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.219
I covered for you
and I got grounded,

17:32.319 --> 17:34.287
and you don't even care!

17:34.387 --> 17:36.089
Well, I am sorry,
Darlene, all right?

17:36.189 --> 17:39.326
No, you're getting
off way too easy, Becky.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.627
Go home, Darlene.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.330
Look, Jackie is
putting up with you.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.831
Mom and Dad are impossible.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.032
Mom and Jackie are fighting.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.567
Everybody is yelling
at everybody else,

17:47.667 --> 17:49.836
and nobody's saying what
they should be saying.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.838
Becky, you're a
selfish, inconsiderate,

17:51.938 --> 17:52.805

Becky, pick up the phone.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.873
OK.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.976
Listen, um, your dad wanted
you know he misses you

18:30.076 --> 18:32.412
and he wants you to come home.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.148
And he thinks you guys can
work out all your problems

18:35.248 --> 18:37.917
if you'd come back.

Not the same.

Thanks, Darlene.

Hey.

Yo, Jack.

Is it OK if I use the washer?

19:42.949 --> 19:43.750
Sure, go ahead.

19:46.586 --> 19:51.258
This war, this vendetta,
this Sicilian thing must end.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.225

20:00.066 --> 20:00.967
Hey.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.569
Hi, I've just got
a couple of loads,

20:02.669 --> 20:03.936
and I'll get out of here.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.876
No rush.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.344
[sigh]

20:14.414 --> 20:17.250
So, you seeing that guy again?

20:17.350 --> 20:18.150
Jonathan?

20:18.251 --> 20:20.152
Yeah, I saw him last night.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.053
Mm.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.058
What'd you wear?

20:26.158 --> 20:28.060
Jeans and my red blouse.

20:28.160 --> 20:28.961
Mm.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.730
We went bowling.

20:30.830 --> 20:31.631
Oh.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.501
That's a good choice.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.269
How are things back here?

20:36.369 --> 20:40.006
Well, she's grounded
for two weeks.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.941
We're upped the
curfew a half hour.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.343
Allowance stays the same.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.711
What about Mark?

20:44.811 --> 20:46.012
No No, absolutely not.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.481
We would not budge on that.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.518
We forbade her to
ever see him again,

20:51.618 --> 20:55.187
so you should wear your
blue dress to the wedding.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.524
Mother, are we going to be the
last people in the free world

20:57.624 --> 20:58.858
to get a dishwasher?

20:58.958 --> 20:59.759
Jeez!

21:02.295 --> 21:04.497
Oh, and I forgot.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.133
She's calling me Mother.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.068
[music playing]

21:13.005 --> 21:14.341
[phone ringing]

21:15.908 --> 21:17.977
Just let it ring.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.813
JACKIE (ON MACHINE):
(SULTRILY) Hi, this is Jackie.

21:20.913 --> 21:21.914
Leave a message.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.651
Bye.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.018
[beep]

21:26.118 --> 21:27.086
ROSEANNE (ON MACHINE): Jackie?

21:27.186 --> 21:29.055
Jackie, pick up.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.056
Jackie?

21:30.156 --> 21:31.190
OK.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.059
Listen, I was just
reading in "Cosmo," there

21:33.159 --> 21:35.795
these great new exercises.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.197
It's like you look up at the
ceiling and you chew, see.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.866
And you do it for, like,
five minutes every day,

21:39.966 --> 21:41.768
and it'll fix up that
scary deal you got

21:41.868 --> 21:43.936
going in the back of your neck.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.438
