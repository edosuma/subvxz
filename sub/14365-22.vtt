00:00.904 --> 00:03.839
<i>Previously on "Transformers Prime"...</i>

00:03.908 --> 00:07.590
It is paramount that we recover
the final four Iacon relics ...

00:07.591 --> 00:10.045
the Omega keys.

00:10.114 --> 00:12.047
- Keys?
- To what?

00:12.116 --> 00:15.050
The regeneration of our home planet.

00:15.119 --> 00:19.855
A tomb. One known to contain
the remains of Primes.

00:19.924 --> 00:25.928
At long last, the power of the
Primes belongs to me!

00:25.996 --> 00:29.765
Four sets of coordinates from
Alpha Trion remain encrypted.

00:29.834 --> 00:33.069
It is logical to conclude
that each corresponds

00:33.070 --> 00:36.305
to the location of
one of the Omega keys.

00:36.373 --> 00:40.509
My first creation, fashioned
from the very blood of Unicron.

00:40.578 --> 00:43.245
I call it the Dark Star Saber.

00:43.314 --> 00:45.347
The relic now!

00:45.416 --> 00:49.084
Oh, you mean this?
Finders keepers.

01:03.801 --> 01:07.202
You should have seen
Optimus Prime's face when his

01:07.271 --> 01:11.173
precious Star Saber
shattered like glass and, with it

01:11.242 --> 01:13.842
his dreams of an Autobot victory.

01:13.911 --> 01:17.513
Granted, Optimus will be more
determined than ever to discover

01:17.581 --> 01:23.919
the locations of the remaining
Iacon entries before we can.

01:28.692 --> 01:29.658
Ah, very good.

01:29.727 --> 01:32.928
I see you have decoded the next
set of coordinates.

01:32.997 --> 01:35.364
Way to step things up,
Soundwave.

01:35.432 --> 01:39.801
I do hope this Iacon relic is
something less sacred and more

01:39.870 --> 01:43.105
profane, like an
electro-disruptor cannon.

01:43.174 --> 01:48.043
- We could use one of those.
- Indeed, Knockout.

01:48.112 --> 01:50.913
Dreadwing, report to the bridge
immediately.

01:50.981 --> 01:56.185
Please, lord Megatron, allow me the
honor of retrieving this relic for you.

01:56.253 --> 02:04.126
I'm surprised you would risk your
finish so soon after your accident.

02:04.195 --> 02:07.296
Nonetheless, I remain
unconvinced that you are the best

02:07.364 --> 02:12.401
choice for the task since you
failed to secure the phase shifter.

02:12.469 --> 02:16.572
I lacked the proper tools.
But since Soundwave's currently

02:16.640 --> 02:21.310
occupied, I can't imagine he'll
mind if I borrow this...

02:21.378 --> 02:24.814
So that I might better secure your prize

02:24.815 --> 02:28.250
and heap some hurt on the Autobots.

<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

03:23.393 --> 03:27.430
I'm gonna be a great warrior
someday, like Optimus.

03:27.499 --> 03:31.567
Well, train hard and gain some wisdom
along the way, and I'm sure it'll happen.

03:31.636 --> 03:33.803
Oh, it will.
It's my destiny.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.572
How so?

03:36.641 --> 03:39.242
Well, one minute I'm on
security detail at Iacon.

03:43.848 --> 03:47.550
I mean, what are the chances, right?
Things happen for a reason.

03:47.619 --> 03:49.152
We get it, Smokescreen.

03:49.220 --> 03:51.654
You're special.
We're lucky to have you.

03:51.723 --> 03:54.690
All I'm really saying is,
I've come a long way, and this

03:54.759 --> 03:57.894
is one opportunity I don't plan
on messing up.

03:57.962 --> 04:02.565
Autobots, the next Iacon
coordinates have been decoded.

04:02.634 --> 04:06.536
Ratchet, ready the ground bridge.

04:07.672 --> 04:12.742
Last one to the Omega key has to
scrub the Energon tanks for a week.

04:12.810 --> 04:14.911
Didn't know we were keeping score.

04:14.979 --> 04:19.548
Arcee, Bumblebee, prepare to roll out.

04:22.019 --> 04:23.619
Wait. What about me?

04:24.989 --> 04:27.190
I mean me and Bulkhead.

04:27.258 --> 04:30.493
The two of you will remain
here in the event i'm able

04:30.562 --> 04:34.864
to decode a subsequent database
entry before the others return.

04:34.933 --> 04:38.234
Optimus is right.
Considering the very fate of

04:38.303 --> 04:43.706
Cybertron is at stake,
response time is critical.

04:43.775 --> 04:45.608
Keep your engines idling, kid.

04:45.677 --> 04:48.678
Come on, Bee.
Destiny awaits.

04:55.452 --> 04:57.720
We call it a pit stop.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.990
We'll get back in the race.

05:14.305 --> 05:19.242
Over there.

05:19.310 --> 05:24.480
Well, well, just the
Autobots I wanted to see.

05:24.549 --> 05:27.216
I'll handle the mad doctor.
You grab the key.

05:28.286 --> 05:34.757
I've been waiting to thank
you both for all the memories.

05:49.873 --> 05:54.577
Who knew that sound waves
could be such a.... Knockout?

05:55.780 --> 05:59.682
What's that, dear?
I can't hear you!

06:00.251 --> 06:02.286
Bee, the relic!

06:08.059 --> 06:10.793
Scrap.

06:10.862 --> 06:13.696
How low can it go?

06:23.074 --> 06:26.275
Subwoofer or depth charge?

06:43.950 --> 06:45.650
Scrap.

06:49.723 --> 06:53.958
It appears identical to the one
taken from me by Optimus Prime.

06:54.027 --> 06:57.562
Ah.
Perhaps it is a decoy the Autobots

06:57.631 --> 07:01.866
allowed you to seize
as a means of sabotage.

07:01.935 --> 07:06.170
Unlikely, my liege. They
battled too desperately for it.

07:06.239 --> 07:08.940
Then pieces of a larger
puzzle, perhaps.

07:12.012 --> 07:15.213
Excellent, Soundwave.
With any luck, these new

07:15.282 --> 07:17.782
coordinates will shed
some light on the subject.

07:17.851 --> 07:22.253
Soundwave's on fire.
And so I am.

07:22.322 --> 07:25.890
Keep your vanity in check, doctor.

07:25.959 --> 07:28.259
Haven't I proven myself?!

07:28.328 --> 07:32.330
Your scientific expertise
remains of greater use to me

07:32.399 --> 07:35.199
analyzing our latest acquisition.

07:35.268 --> 07:40.238
I must know what this
relic is and what it can do.

07:52.085 --> 07:56.955
I'm sorry, Optimus.
Knockout was there, waiting for us.

07:57.023 --> 07:59.724
Seems the 'Cons are improving
their decoding skills.

07:59.793 --> 08:04.295
And it seems that, with two
keys already separated, no one

08:04.364 --> 08:08.132
currently possesses the
means to revive Cybertron.

08:08.201 --> 08:12.588
While our quest to restore our
planet may have reached a stalemate,

08:12.589 --> 08:16.975
securing the remaining keys is still
the most prudent course of action.

08:17.043 --> 08:20.845
Man, it must have been crazy
with Knockout going all sonic.

08:20.914 --> 08:22.647
Oh, I wish I'd been there.
I would have ...

08:22.716 --> 08:23.681
Would have what?

08:23.750 --> 08:25.984
Recovered the key like
you did the first one?

08:26.052 --> 08:29.687
Maybe. Who knows?
I just want us to be firing on

08:29.756 --> 08:32.323
all cylinders, you know, now
that the Star Saber's gone.

08:32.392 --> 08:35.058
And I have a pretty
good track record so far.

08:44.135 --> 08:48.039
Look, kid, Arcee and
Bumblebee are no slouches, and

08:48.108 --> 08:52.176
Optimus managed just fine for
eons without the big sword.

08:52.245 --> 08:54.078
Of course, you wouldn't know about that.

08:54.147 --> 08:57.582
And you've been locked in stasis the
whole time we've been fighting this war.

08:57.650 --> 09:00.818
Exactly, and I'm ready to
make up for lost time.

09:00.887 --> 09:06.391
When Optimus says you're ready.
You got to be in this for the long haul.

09:07.798 --> 09:09.927
Slow and steady wins the race.

09:24.711 --> 09:27.545
Hurry up, already!

09:27.614 --> 09:31.349
How is it possible that
speed-enhancing Energon takes

09:31.418 --> 09:36.320
longer to process than regular Energon?!

09:44.497 --> 09:49.801
An entire chunk of Red Energon,
and this is all I get?!

09:50.870 --> 09:54.672
There's enough here for one
dose, maybe two!

09:56.242 --> 10:02.847
Mmm. Decepticon movement.
While speed is hardly a suitable

10:02.916 --> 10:07.185
replacement for the might of the
Apex armor, it should provide me

10:07.253 --> 10:14.125
with enough of an edge to obtain
a more formidable relic.

10:14.194 --> 10:16.461
The next coordinates are ready.

10:16.529 --> 10:21.732
There remains one set left to decode.

10:21.801 --> 10:22.633
On it, boss.

10:22.702 --> 10:27.805
I'm gonna bring
back that key. Yeah ...

10:29.676 --> 10:32.184
Uh, Bulk?

10:32.185 --> 10:35.947
Forgetting something?

10:41.121 --> 10:46.190
Make sure you keep an eye
on destiny's child, okay?

10:47.227 --> 10:50.728
Compared to watching Miko,
piece of cake.

11:06.845 --> 11:10.581
Stick close.
And stay focused.

11:10.650 --> 11:13.151
- Gotcha!
- I mean it.

11:13.219 --> 11:15.987
- Me too.
- Shh.

11:18.324 --> 11:19.924
What is that?

11:25.198 --> 11:28.933
One of the last sounds
that you will ever hear.

11:29.002 --> 11:30.902
Dreadwing.

11:57.730 --> 11:59.597
We got to get out of here now!

12:34.499 --> 12:39.904
Smoke, I'll handle Dreadwing.
Go get the relic.

12:39.973 --> 12:44.642
You got it.

12:44.711 --> 12:47.912
You love doing your dirty
work from a distance, don't you?

12:47.981 --> 12:51.882
Too bad you don't have the ball
bearings to fight up close and personal.

12:51.951 --> 12:56.854
In this particular case, I will be
all too happy to make an exception.

13:42.167 --> 13:48.806
An admirable effort, but you obviously
forgot how our last encounter ended.

13:50.543 --> 13:52.476
No, I didn't.

14:21.540 --> 14:23.341
Smoke, I'm on my way.

14:45.697 --> 14:50.534
Destiny.

14:56.976 --> 15:01.078
<i>Smokescreen!
Wake up!</i>

15:02.248 --> 15:03.514
Wh-what happened?

15:04.450 --> 15:06.951
That's what I want to know.

15:07.019 --> 15:09.553
The Omega key.

15:09.622 --> 15:14.091
I had it until
something hit me from behind.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.093
Dreadwing must have had
backup.

15:16.162 --> 15:20.231
That relic's long gone.
Ratchet, we need a bridge.

15:20.299 --> 15:24.869
I-I told Optimus I'd return
with that key.

15:27.807 --> 15:30.719
Listen, kid, Alpha
Trion said we need all

15:30.720 --> 15:33.632
four keys to restore
Cybertron, remember?

15:33.633 --> 15:37.348
We just need to hang on
to the one we have

15:37.416 --> 15:42.250
and find a way to get the
others back from Megatron.

15:42.955 --> 15:49.833
The promise of a new Cybertron
in the palm of my hand...

15:49.896 --> 15:52.930
when I obtain all four.

16:04.165 --> 16:06.033
Smokescreen was
sucker-punched.

16:06.102 --> 16:08.736
Could have happened to any of us.

16:08.804 --> 16:12.272
But it didn't, because I was
the one who dropped his guard.

16:12.341 --> 16:16.343
I was the one who blew it. Some
great warrior I'm turning out to be.

16:16.412 --> 16:18.646
You still don't get it, do you?

16:18.714 --> 16:21.649
A couple of victories aren't
gonna make you a legend.

16:21.717 --> 16:25.085
And not every mission results
in success, not for me, not for

16:25.154 --> 16:27.388
Bee, not even for Optimus.

16:27.456 --> 16:30.190
We've gained relics,
and we've lost some.

16:30.259 --> 16:33.427
We've also lost friends.
We've even lost a world.

16:33.496 --> 16:37.965
But this is one time we get a do-over.
We have a chance to bring back

16:38.034 --> 16:41.602
Cybertron, and everyone in this
room needs to be in sync.

16:41.671 --> 16:45.906
This isn't about you or your destiny.

16:45.975 --> 16:52.079
- Arcee, you have made your point.
- Optimus, he needs to hear this.

16:52.148 --> 16:55.416
You might actually become a
great warrior one day, and I

16:55.484 --> 16:58.819
sincerely hope that you do.
But greatness begins and ends

16:58.888 --> 17:02.222
with putting the team first,
not your personal scorecard.

17:02.291 --> 17:05.092
There's nothing I
wouldn't do for you guys.

17:05.161 --> 17:09.262
Then stop trying to be a hero
and start being an Autobot.

17:14.435 --> 17:19.039
You know what?
Maybe I'm just not good enough.

17:21.644 --> 17:25.846
Next time Optimus advises you
to stop, perhaps you should listen.

17:25.915 --> 17:28.449
I'll bring him back.

17:28.517 --> 17:32.186
Smokescreen is young,
Bulkhead, and has much to learn,

17:32.254 --> 17:35.222
but right now he needs
to clear his thoughts.

17:35.291 --> 17:41.628
And I need to finish decoding
the final Iacon entry.

17:45.901 --> 17:49.236
You never even spied the relic?!

17:49.305 --> 17:54.341
By the time I reached the location,
it was gone, as were the Autobots.

17:54.410 --> 17:59.664
It would serve us well to not only decode
the final Iacon entry before Optimus

17:59.665 --> 18:04.918
Prime does, but to recapture those
relics currently held by the Autobots.

18:04.987 --> 18:08.236
Soundwave.
Despite your primary task,

18:08.237 --> 18:10.457
I trust that you have been making

18:10.526 --> 18:14.928
progress pinpointing the
location of their base.

18:19.101 --> 18:20.367
Good.

18:20.436 --> 18:23.937
Given the recent accumulation of
evidence, we possess a clearer

18:24.006 --> 18:27.674
idea of where their human
colleagues reside.

18:27.743 --> 18:32.946
<i>And Laserbeak should soon determine
whether the Autobots dwell in proximity.</i>

18:39.555 --> 18:43.957
Ah. The final
entry has been decoded.

18:45.661 --> 18:49.830
Has it?

18:50.733 --> 18:54.368
Perhaps it's a layer of
secondary encryption.

18:58.072 --> 19:01.341
The coordinates are forming
an image.

19:01.410 --> 19:08.916
Why would the final Iacon entry
be different from the others?

19:08.984 --> 19:11.318
Maybe it's a picture of the relic.

19:11.387 --> 19:15.823
Of what possible use could that
be to us without knowing its location?

19:15.891 --> 19:19.226
I trust that Alpha
Trion has his reasons.

19:26.668 --> 19:29.570
Smokescreen?

19:29.638 --> 19:35.576
Prime's latest recruit is
the final relic of Iacon?

19:35.644 --> 19:37.678
Is this that hotshot's idea of a joke?

19:39.682 --> 19:44.318
- Maybe he knows where the key is.
- And never bothered to mention it?

19:44.386 --> 19:48.388
A more likely possibility is
that Smokescreen himself somehow

19:48.457 --> 19:50.357
is the key, without knowing it.

19:50.426 --> 19:54.194
Whatever the case, he
could be in grave danger.

19:54.263 --> 19:58.868
Smokescreen, return to base immediately.

20:00.936 --> 20:03.737
He may have deactivated his comm link.

20:03.806 --> 20:07.608
Locate his position and
prepare the ground bridge.

20:22.857 --> 20:26.927
It seems our side project
is already paying off.

20:45.613 --> 20:49.249
You picked the wrong
day to mess with me, 'Con.

21:09.337 --> 21:11.438
Smokescreen.

21:15.610 --> 21:17.611
No!
