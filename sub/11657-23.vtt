(mellow music playing)

00:59.400 --> 01:01.166
Oh, Lily, honey,
how do you like your steak?

01:01.233 --> 01:02.500
Oh, medium's fine.

01:02.567 --> 01:04.266
Why are we cooking outdoors?

01:04.333 --> 01:05.967
Ma, we're having a barbecue.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.934
Do you know what they call cooking meat
over an open fire in Sicily?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.533
-No. What?
-Poverty.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.033
Gee, those steaks smell good.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.200
What do you know, Rose?

01:16.266 --> 01:19.000
You thought you could go out
in the ocean and catch fish sticks.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.266
Oh, I just love barbecues.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.400
We used to have the most
wonderful ones back home.

01:25.467 --> 01:27.667
I can remember sitting out
under a big ol' tree

01:27.734 --> 01:30.934
with the Darcy triplets
Hank, Beau and Dove,

01:31.000 --> 01:32.900
eating and talking and laughing.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.734
And then long towards
the end of the meal,

01:34.800 --> 01:36.533
why, the boys always got
into a fight

01:36.600 --> 01:40.767
over who was gonna get to lick
the barbecue sauce from my fingertips

01:40.834 --> 01:42.633
and kiss away the little droplet of butter

01:42.700 --> 01:44.600
that always drizzled down my chin.

01:46.300 --> 01:49.233
Oh, has it gotten awful hot out here?

01:49.300 --> 01:50.734
I'll go get the lemonade.

01:52.300 --> 01:55.000
Oh, we used to cook outdoors
all the time when we were kids.

01:55.066 --> 01:56.433
Remember our camping trips, Lily?

01:56.500 --> 01:57.834
Oh, I sure do.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.066
During the summer,

01:59.133 --> 02:03.600
our father would take the whole family
on camping trips into the wilderness.

02:03.667 --> 02:06.100
Of course, it wasn't
really the wilderness.

02:06.166 --> 02:08.500
He'd drive in circles
for about 20 minutes

02:08.567 --> 02:12.133
and then end up in the woods
just beyond the barn.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.367
It was years before all the kids
caught on to dad's trick.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.033
What do you mean,
"just beyond the barn"?

02:21.266 --> 02:22.900
Here we are...

02:22.967 --> 02:25.734
A nice, fresh pitcher
of ice cold lemonade.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.133
Pour me a cup, would you?

02:27.200 --> 02:28.633
I'm sweating like a horse.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.767
Here, Sophia,
let me get it for you.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.133
That's okay, honey. I'll do it.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.934
No. Now, Rose, please,
I told you when I first arrived

02:36.000 --> 02:38.133
I didn't want any special treatment.

02:38.200 --> 02:38.934
I'm sorry.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.233
It's been nearly six months now
since I lost my sight,

02:42.300 --> 02:45.000
and I've learned to cope
with just about anything.

02:45.066 --> 02:47.934
When I was in college,
I taught school part time

02:48.000 --> 02:49.700
at one of those schools for the blind.

02:49.767 --> 02:52.800
It is really amazing
what they can accomplish.

02:52.867 --> 02:55.700
I went to one of those schools
for a little while.

02:55.767 --> 02:59.000
It's just a lot of talking
and handholding.

02:59.066 --> 03:01.000
Never been so bored in my life.

03:01.066 --> 03:02.400
I think I'm just the kind of person

03:02.467 --> 03:05.066
that likes to get out there and do it.

03:05.133 --> 03:06.834
Did you know that my sister Lily

03:06.900 --> 03:10.667
still holds the record at our high school
for the 100-yard dash?

03:10.734 --> 03:13.100
She served three terms
on the city council,

03:13.166 --> 03:17.066
and she was the first woman in St. Olaf's
to ever have a pilot's license.

03:17.133 --> 03:19.700
Oh, really? Well, we have
something in common, Lily.

03:19.767 --> 03:23.333
I was the first woman in my hometown
ever to have a pilot.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.800
Blanche's bed is next to the x-15

03:28.867 --> 03:31.200
at the Space and Aviation Museum.

03:32.767 --> 03:35.633
Would you be interested in going to
an outdoor concert tonight?

03:35.700 --> 03:38.433
Oh, you couldn't drag me
out of this house tonight.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.767
<i>St. Elsewhere's</i> on.

03:39.834 --> 03:42.133
That's my favorite program.
I never miss it.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.734
You still watch television?

03:43.800 --> 03:45.800
Well, I don't really watch it.

03:45.867 --> 03:48.100
I just pretend it's radio.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.400
We don't exactly watch it, either.

03:50.467 --> 03:54.033
With our crummy TV,
we get two channels at once.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.433
For a while there, I thought Benson
was having an affair with Miss Ellie.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.600
Listen, mom,
we cannot afford a new TV.

04:03.667 --> 04:07.800
We're using the household money to repair
the roof and repave the driveway.

04:07.867 --> 04:09.567
Great. And what am I supposed to do

04:09.633 --> 04:12.333
while every other old lady
on the block is watching <i>Cosby?</i>

04:12.400 --> 04:14.367
Well, you can sit in the new driveway

04:14.433 --> 04:18.834
and hope that an amusing
Black family drops by.

04:21.233 --> 04:22.800
Maybe we could sell our old TV

04:22.867 --> 04:24.767
and use the money towards
one of those new stereo models.

04:24.834 --> 04:27.800
Sell it? Honey, I don't think
we could give it away.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.700
Oh, you'd be amazed
at the things people will buy.

04:30.767 --> 04:33.066
When I moved from my house
into the apartment,

04:33.133 --> 04:36.100
I had a garage sale,
and I made a lot of money.

04:36.166 --> 04:38.066
'Course, I probably
would have made a lot more

04:38.133 --> 04:40.133
if I could tell a one from a 20.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.333
Ooh, girls, let's do that.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.800
Let's have a garage sale.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.934
Well, can we get in trouble,
having a garage sale?

04:46.000 --> 04:49.066
I mean, we're not actually
selling a garage.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.266
If it's a choice between the two of them,

04:52.333 --> 04:54.233
let the blind one make change.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.767
(tranquil music playing)

05:02.166 --> 05:05.900
Isn't it amazing that three people could
accumulate so much stuff?

05:05.967 --> 05:08.233
Will you look at this.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.800
I got this doll on my tenth birthday.

05:11.867 --> 05:14.633
Oh, I can't believe
I've kept her all these years.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.800
Her hair's falling out,
her clothes are all worn,

05:17.867 --> 05:19.700
she smells of mothballs.

05:19.767 --> 05:22.633
Hey, I may not be Ann-Margret,
but I'm still your mother.

05:27.900 --> 05:33.233
-Girls, look at this!
-Isn't this...?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.367
You know, I remember
wearing this outfit

05:35.433 --> 05:37.166
the night George took me to Woodstock.

05:37.233 --> 05:40.066
Oh, what a night.
I will never forget it.

05:40.133 --> 05:43.667
Listening to the music
of Mr. Richie Havens and Mr. Bob Dylan

05:43.734 --> 05:45.800
and then making love in the mud.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.433
You went to Woodstock?

05:47.500 --> 05:48.567
Well, actually, it was the movie,

05:48.633 --> 05:51.934
but afterwards we did go home
and make love in the mud.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.667
I guess the '60s were a confusing time
for all of us, Blanche.

05:56.367 --> 05:59.900
Oh, gee, I'd forgotten
I had these candlesticks.

05:59.967 --> 06:01.367
They were mother's.

06:01.433 --> 06:03.667
Oh, they'd be perfect
for the alcove table.

06:03.734 --> 06:05.767
-Oh, let me do it.
-Oh, no, no, wait, wait.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.500
Now, Rose, I'm fine.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.133
-No, I'm just going to get your cane.
-No, I don't need that.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.734
Last night I memorized the layout
for the whole house.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.300
Now, please stop treating me
as if I'm totally helpless.

06:15.367 --> 06:18.867
I'm sorry. You know how I am.
I... I guess I'm overprotective.

06:21.767 --> 06:24.000
Who invited Gidget
to the garage sale?

06:25.367 --> 06:28.300
Girls, I'm feeling a little chilly.
I think I'll go and get my sweater.

06:28.367 --> 06:29.667
Oh, no, I'll get that for you.

06:29.734 --> 06:32.166
Oh, Rose, for heaven's sakes.
I can find my own way.

06:32.233 --> 06:33.800
I know you're trying to help,

06:33.867 --> 06:37.633
but if I could pilot my own plane
cross-country during a storm,

06:37.700 --> 06:40.200
I can certainly find my way
across the room.

06:41.934 --> 06:45.734
There. Now, do you see
that I don't need anybody's help?

06:48.600 --> 06:51.300
(mellow music playing)

07:09.133 --> 07:12.200
Oh, my god! Rose? Rose!

07:12.266 --> 07:13.133
Rose, help!

07:13.200 --> 07:16.900
Oh, wait. Don't get over there, darling.
Come over here. Stand back.

07:16.967 --> 07:18.300
-What was it?
-Just calm down.

07:18.367 --> 07:20.667
It's all right, it's all right.
She's putting it out.

07:20.734 --> 07:21.734
(fire distinguisher blowing)

07:21.800 --> 07:23.667
There we go. It's all right.

07:24.567 --> 07:25.734
Is everyone all right?

07:25.800 --> 07:28.900
Oh, everyone's fine.
We just had a little accident.

07:28.967 --> 07:30.600
Well, we didn't have a little accident.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.500
-Lily had a little accident.
-Blanche, please.

07:32.567 --> 07:35.800
I'm sorry, I... I guess
I'm not used to your stove.

07:35.867 --> 07:37.767
Maybe you shouldn't
have been cooking on it, darling.

07:37.834 --> 07:39.467
Well, somebody
could have gotten hurt.

07:39.533 --> 07:42.700
I said I was sorry.
It was an accident.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.066
Let's be fair.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.433
It could have happened
to any one of you.

07:53.633 --> 07:55.266
Rose, Lily can't go on like this.

07:55.333 --> 07:56.667
You have to do something.

07:57.533 --> 07:59.367
Well, I think you girls are overreacting.

07:59.433 --> 08:01.934
It was just a little grease fire.
No harm done.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.500
This time! What if nobody'd been home?

08:04.567 --> 08:06.500
Rose, it's not just the fire.

08:06.567 --> 08:08.233
What do you expect me to do?

08:08.300 --> 08:10.400
There's nothing you can do, Rose.

08:10.467 --> 08:13.000
She has to learn
to do things for herself.

08:13.066 --> 08:14.967
Honey, maybe she ought to
go back to that school.

08:15.033 --> 08:17.166
Well, you heard her. It's not for her.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.200
She's a very independent person.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.100
No, she's not, Rose,

08:21.166 --> 08:25.200
not till she learns to be
independent as a blind person.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.934
I'll... I'll talk to her.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.834
Rose?

08:38.900 --> 08:40.867
Yes. Lily, I just...

08:40.934 --> 08:43.667
I know. You just wanted
to see if I was all right.

08:43.734 --> 08:46.667
Rose, really, I'm fine.

08:47.133 --> 08:49.667
I've been having accidents
since I was two years old.

08:49.734 --> 08:52.533
This is not a major crisis.
You don't have to worry about me.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.133
It's hard for me not to.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.400
I know. That's because
you're a worrier.

08:56.467 --> 08:57.967
I remember when you were
six years old

08:58.033 --> 09:00.500
and dad got you that puppy
for your birthday.

09:00.567 --> 09:03.934
You worried because you thought
her paws were too big

09:04.000 --> 09:05.734
and that the other dogs
would laugh at her.

09:06.967 --> 09:10.600
Well, they did!
They used to bark and point at her!

09:12.266 --> 09:13.967
Everybody pointed at her.

09:14.033 --> 09:16.300
You made her wear a bonnet
and matching booties.

09:18.567 --> 09:21.266
Don't change the subject on me, Lily.

09:22.567 --> 09:25.133
Honey, I'm worried about you.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.633
Oh, Rose, you'd be worried if you
couldn't find anything to worry about.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.734
And stop pouting.
I was only teasing.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.767
How did you know
I was pouting?

09:34.367 --> 09:36.500
You always pout when I tease you.

09:36.567 --> 09:38.667
-Always?
-Always.

09:38.734 --> 09:41.800
You're a pouter, Rose,
a pouter and a worrier.

09:41.867 --> 09:42.867
Well, maybe you're right,

09:42.934 --> 09:46.200
but I think I have a good reason
to be worried this time.

09:47.266 --> 09:51.800
Lily, I think you're trying
to do too much by yourself.

09:51.867 --> 09:54.800
I've never been one to depend
on other people, Rose.

09:54.867 --> 09:55.734
You know that.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.600
But this is different.

09:57.667 --> 10:01.066
You're not trying out for
the track team in high school.

10:01.133 --> 10:05.200
You're trying to learn to cope
with daily life as a blind person.

10:12.867 --> 10:15.166
Do you see this dress, Rose?
It's my favorite.

10:15.233 --> 10:16.533
It's awfully pretty.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.033
It's my favorite...

10:18.467 --> 10:22.633
because it's the only one
I can clearly remember.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.567
I remember what it looks like,

10:25.633 --> 10:28.166
and I remember
what it looks like on me,

10:28.233 --> 10:30.934
and because of that,
I wear it all the time.

10:31.967 --> 10:34.467
-You'll adjust, Lily.
-I don't want to adjust!

10:34.533 --> 10:37.166
I want to be the person
that I used to be!

10:37.233 --> 10:38.934
But you have to face the truth.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.166
You need help!

10:40.233 --> 10:44.233
Now, you can deal with it,
but you can't do it all by yourself.

10:44.300 --> 10:48.100
Rose, all my life I've done
everything I wanted to do.

10:48.166 --> 10:50.233
Nothing's ever stood
in my way before.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.633
For the past six months,

10:51.700 --> 10:53.600
that's how I've been trying
to deal with everything.

10:53.667 --> 10:57.200
I thought that I could overcome
this thing by myself.

10:58.333 --> 10:59.867
I guess that deep down inside,

10:59.934 --> 11:02.767
I thought I could make it go away.

11:03.667 --> 11:04.767
But I can't.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.166
Every morning when I wake up,
it's still there,

11:10.900 --> 11:12.700
and that terrifies me.

11:14.033 --> 11:15.934
Rose, I do need your help.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.767
That's why I came to Miami...

11:17.834 --> 11:19.600
to ask you to come home with me.

11:20.567 --> 11:23.934
Oh, Rose, please come home with me.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.633
I can't make it by myself! (crying)

11:28.233 --> 11:29.667
Oh, honey.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.300
(melancholy music playing)

11:40.400 --> 11:43.500
So I think the best thing for me to do
is move back to Lily's place in Chicago.

11:43.567 --> 11:46.300
It'll be a lot easier for me to get used
to new surroundings

11:46.367 --> 11:47.233
than it would be for her.

11:47.300 --> 11:50.467
You think you moving to Chicago
is gonna solve Lily's problems?

11:50.533 --> 11:51.600
I want to help her.

11:51.667 --> 11:55.266
Oh, I don't think you're helping her
by offering to be a nursemaid.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.300
I mean, Lily is not an invalid.

11:57.367 --> 11:58.600
You don't understand.

11:58.667 --> 12:02.600
All our lives, Lily was the one
who always took care of me.

12:02.667 --> 12:05.266
It doesn't matter what I think
is best for her.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.900
If Lily wants me to take care of her,
I can't refuse.

12:07.967 --> 12:12.600
Well, seems to me that part of the reason
you're doing this is out of guilt.

12:13.367 --> 12:14.266
Maybe you're right.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.000
Oh, honey, it's a terrible thing
to do something out of guilt.

12:17.066 --> 12:18.734
Believe me, I know.

12:19.467 --> 12:22.166
Just about the time that George and I
were getting serious,

12:22.233 --> 12:23.900
he was shipped off to Korea.

12:23.967 --> 12:26.200
Well, I wanted to do my part
for the war effort,

12:26.266 --> 12:29.400
so I took a job in a factory
that made canteens.

12:29.467 --> 12:32.200
I figured that one of the canteens
that I had riveted

12:32.266 --> 12:34.400
would somehow find its way to George

12:34.467 --> 12:37.633
and his lips would drink
from the galvanized spout

12:37.700 --> 12:39.667
I had so lovingly fashioned,

12:39.734 --> 12:42.233
thereby symbolically reuniting us.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.867
Oh, Blanche, that's a beautiful reason
to take that job.

12:45.934 --> 12:47.266
Well, that wasn't the only reason.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.734
That factory also had
a comprehensive dental plan,

12:49.800 --> 12:52.367
and I was in desperate need
of a bridge and two crowns.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.000
War is hell.

12:56.266 --> 12:57.367
So were my teeth.

12:57.433 --> 13:00.367
Anyway, while I was working
on that assembly line,

13:00.433 --> 13:04.133
why, I met a young man
named Andrew Beandorf.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.567
Oh, it was just a platonic thing.

13:05.633 --> 13:07.200
We just went out to the movies
and dinner.

13:07.266 --> 13:09.867
But when George came home
on leave, he was furious.

13:10.367 --> 13:13.233
He accused me, unjustly, of infidelity

13:13.300 --> 13:15.467
while he was off fighting
in some foreign land,

13:15.533 --> 13:18.867
some godforsaken land where people
didn't even believe in Jesus,

13:18.934 --> 13:21.633
and he forbade me
ever to see Andrew again.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.000
So, 'course I didn't.

13:23.066 --> 13:27.400
So you lost a good friend just because
George made you feel guilty about it.

13:27.467 --> 13:30.433
That's right. I lost a good friend
and a wonderful companion

13:30.500 --> 13:32.000
and an excellent lover.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.433
An excellent lover?

13:39.333 --> 13:41.133
Did I say excellent lover?

13:41.200 --> 13:44.767
Oh, no, I meant excellent riveter.

13:44.834 --> 13:47.834
I can understand
how you could confuse the two.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.100
Anyway, the point is,
guilt is a very bad thing. Story over.

13:56.734 --> 13:58.066
I was just talking to Lily.

13:58.133 --> 14:00.133
I hear you're moving with her
back to Chicago.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.333
That's right.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.033
Good idea. Now you can ruin
your life and hers.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.700
I got dibs on Rose's room.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.934
Sophia, you just don't understand.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.900
Please, Rose.
What I forgot, you'll never know.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.133
Tell her, Dorothy, how bad off I was
when I had my stroke.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.934
You were really sick, ma.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.600
You know, in the beginning,
she couldn't walk,

14:19.667 --> 14:21.900
she couldn't talk,
she couldn't even feed herself.

14:21.967 --> 14:24.600
All I could do was sit
and feel sorry for myself,

14:24.667 --> 14:26.433
which is what I did all the time.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.667
But you got better.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.133
Yeah, because she stopped
coddling me.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.333
She screamed, she hollered,
day and night.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.433
She made me do my therapy.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.567
She forced me to rebuild my life
because she knew I could,

14:38.133 --> 14:39.600
and for that I'll always be grateful.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.433
Ah, thanks, ma.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.667
I only have one question.

14:42.734 --> 14:45.834
Now that I'm better, why do you
still scream and holler at me?

14:49.700 --> 14:53.000
I'm not sure what was best
for you is best for Lily.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.567
Look, you didn't ask for my opinion,

14:55.633 --> 14:57.600
but I'm old, so I'm giving it anyway.

14:58.133 --> 15:01.100
You want to help your sister?
Help her to help herself.

15:05.033 --> 15:07.900
Sophia, that was a very sweet thing
for you to do.

15:07.967 --> 15:10.934
Hey, Rose is a good kid
and I like her a lot,

15:11.700 --> 15:13.667
but after all is said and done,

15:13.734 --> 15:16.800
I would sell Dorothy to the gypsies
to get that bedroom.

15:19.633 --> 15:22.333
(somber music playing)

15:25.500 --> 15:26.433
How much?

15:26.500 --> 15:28.700
2 bucks. Get wild. Treat yourself.

15:29.767 --> 15:31.300
Nah, I'll give you $1.50.

15:31.367 --> 15:34.066
What does this look like... Baghdad?

15:34.133 --> 15:35.266
Get the hell out of here!

15:39.867 --> 15:41.934
Ma, that's no way to sell things.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.500
Hey, go to Neiman Marcus sometime,
see if they treat you any better.

15:48.367 --> 15:49.266
How we doing?

15:49.333 --> 15:51.166
Honey, I don't think we've sold a thing.

15:51.233 --> 15:52.400
I don't get it.

15:52.467 --> 15:56.233
I'll give you $1 for these Elvis Presley
salt and pepper shakers.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.800
$1?

15:58.367 --> 16:01.000
I will have you know the day I bought
these salt and pepper shakers

16:01.066 --> 16:02.433
at the Graceland gift shop,

16:02.500 --> 16:07.100
I thought I saw the king himself walk by
eating a giant chili cheeseburger

16:07.166 --> 16:10.000
and drinking a 36-ounce Dr. Pepper.

16:10.066 --> 16:11.734
Turned out it was an impersonator,

16:11.800 --> 16:14.200
but these are still
very special mementos,

16:14.266 --> 16:18.000
and parting with them is an extremely
painful sacrifice on my part.

16:18.633 --> 16:19.633
Buck and a quarter.

16:19.700 --> 16:22.667
$1.25?

16:22.734 --> 16:26.800
Sir, if that is the kind of respect
you have for genuine Elvis memorabilia,

16:26.867 --> 16:31.467
then I kindly suggest you hand these over
and remove yourself from my property.

16:31.533 --> 16:32.867
Blanche!

16:35.300 --> 16:37.834
Blanche, I can't believe
that you did that!

16:37.900 --> 16:40.600
I mean, they're just a silly
salt and pepper shaker!

16:40.667 --> 16:42.667
The king is gone, Dorothy,

16:43.834 --> 16:46.633
but we must cherish the things
he left behind...

16:46.700 --> 16:47.967
his movies, his songs--

16:48.033 --> 16:49.667
And his seasonings.

16:49.734 --> 16:53.133
Oh, give me that!
No, this was a mistake.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.467
What's going on?

16:54.533 --> 16:57.700
Oh, Mr. Longfellow got in by mistake.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.233
He is not for sale.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.467
Isn't that right, Mr. Longfellow?

17:01.533 --> 17:03.000
(high-pitched voice)
Yes, it is, Rose!

17:06.800 --> 17:08.500
Rose, in my opinion,

17:08.567 --> 17:12.900
it is time to say bye-bye
to Mr. Longfellow and Elvis.

17:12.967 --> 17:16.533
What's the use of having a garage sale
if we can't part with anything?

17:16.600 --> 17:17.700
How much for this hockey stick?

17:17.767 --> 17:19.700
$1,100.

17:23.133 --> 17:23.967
Dorothy.

17:24.033 --> 17:26.033
This isn't an ordinary hockey stick.

17:26.100 --> 17:29.433
Bobby Hull used this.
This is a piece of history.

17:29.500 --> 17:33.467
It's a piece of junk,
and the price tag says $4.

17:33.533 --> 17:35.166
-4.50.
-I'll take it.

17:35.233 --> 17:36.967
Uh, okay, but listen.

17:37.033 --> 17:39.934
Before you go, uh,
come into the house with me.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.633
I'll show you the kind of wood oil
that I use on it.

17:43.700 --> 17:46.233
Wood oil? Are you buying that?

17:46.300 --> 17:47.633
'Course not.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.734
Everybody knows you use paraffin wax
on parched wood.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.567
Come on.

17:51.633 --> 17:53.400
-$6!
-No!

17:53.967 --> 17:56.033
-I'll give you 10.
-I don't want to sell it back!

17:56.100 --> 17:59.166
I'll give you 25, and don't ever
show your face around here again!

17:59.233 --> 18:00.500
Sold!

18:03.400 --> 18:07.066
Uh, he didn't want it.
He said there's a nick in it.

18:07.133 --> 18:09.000
We have to have a return policy,

18:09.066 --> 18:12.367
Oh, girls, listen. Let's face it.

18:12.433 --> 18:14.367
All that so-called junk out there

18:14.433 --> 18:16.600
has too many fond memories
for all of us.

18:16.667 --> 18:19.000
We're never going to
be able to part with it.

18:19.066 --> 18:22.367
We might just as well
call this whole garage sale off.

18:22.433 --> 18:25.100
And kiss our new TV goodbye.

18:26.133 --> 18:27.834
Isn't that right, Mr. Longfellow?

18:27.900 --> 18:30.567
-(high-pitched voice) Yes, it is, Rose.
-(Dorothy) please!

18:33.100 --> 18:34.200
Listen, I have a great idea.

18:34.266 --> 18:36.767
It's a little strange,
it's a little bizarre,

18:36.834 --> 18:39.133
it's slightly off the wall,
but it just might work.

18:39.200 --> 18:39.967
What is it, Dorothy?

18:40.033 --> 18:43.133
Why don't we each take $20
from our pockets,

18:43.200 --> 18:45.900
make a down payment
on a new TV,

18:45.967 --> 18:47.934
and then pay the rest off on time?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.033
Sounds good to me.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.467
Let's go tell everybody
that the sale's over.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.600
You wait right there.
I'll be right back.

18:57.166 --> 18:59.133
-Rose?
-Yes, Lily?

18:59.200 --> 19:00.934
Could you help me
get to the sofa, please?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.166
Oh, sure, honey. Here you go.

19:03.233 --> 19:06.000
Thank you. You're not getting
tired of me yet, are you?

19:06.066 --> 19:07.834
Oh, don't be silly.

19:08.567 --> 19:11.600
Oh, Rose, I really appreciate
what you're doing for me.

19:11.667 --> 19:12.667
I really do.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.300
-Don't mention it.
-(sighs)

19:14.367 --> 19:16.000
Could you please get me
a glass of water?

19:16.066 --> 19:17.200
Sure.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.967
Lily, you've been here a week now.

19:22.033 --> 19:23.567
You know where the kitchen is.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.467
Well, I figured the way
I've been crashing into everything,

19:26.533 --> 19:28.166
you'd rather get it.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.500
Maybe you should get
your drink of water yourself.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.600
I thought you said
you'd look after me, Rose.

19:35.667 --> 19:38.500
Lily, if you can't even
get yourself a drink of water,

19:38.567 --> 19:41.166
you're helpless,
and that scares me.

19:41.233 --> 19:42.734
How do you think I feel?

19:43.333 --> 19:44.834
Well, I think you're scared, too,

19:44.900 --> 19:47.200
but you won't admit that you need help,

19:47.266 --> 19:50.100
professional help
to get on with your life.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.934
Oh, I've given this
a lot of thought, Lily,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.166
and I really think
it's the best way.

19:57.166 --> 20:00.233
Rose, you're not coming back
to Chicago with me, are you?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.200
No.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.700
How can you turn your back
on your own sister?

20:03.767 --> 20:06.633
I'm not turning my back on you.
I love you.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.834
I'm just trying to do
what I think is best for you.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.834
What you think is best?
What do you know about being blind?

20:11.900 --> 20:15.166
Oh, Lily, this is very painful for me.

20:15.233 --> 20:17.333
Please don't make it any harder
than it already is.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.033
I'm sorry, Rose.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.166
I'm sorry.

20:22.233 --> 20:25.567
I promise, I won't ever ask you
for anything again.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.333
(melancholy music playing)

20:37.600 --> 20:38.700
All right, I'll see you in a week.

20:38.767 --> 20:41.600
I'll call myself collect tonight.
You'll tell them I'm not home.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.033
That way you'll know I arrived safely

20:43.100 --> 20:45.934
and you won't have to lie
to the phone company. Bye.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.734
-Bye.
-Ahh.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.433
I forgot my purse!

20:50.500 --> 20:52.800
Oh. I know I'm forgetting
something else.

20:52.867 --> 20:53.934
I know it. I just know it.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.734
Oh, come on, now, Rose.
Calm down.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.567
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

20:57.633 --> 21:00.900
Oh, yes. Lily and I have
barely spoken since she left.

21:00.967 --> 21:02.667
That was two months ago.

21:02.734 --> 21:05.367
Oh, I... I can't say no to Lily.
I have to go.

21:05.433 --> 21:08.200
I said no to her when she asked me
to come live with her,

21:08.266 --> 21:11.100
but I can't say no
when she asks me to come visit.

21:11.166 --> 21:13.266
I know she's gonna ask me
to come live with her again,

21:13.333 --> 21:15.033
and I'm just gonna say no.

21:15.734 --> 21:18.033
(sighs) I think. I'm such a wreck.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.233
You could just cancel
your reservation

21:20.300 --> 21:21.600
and think it over one more day.

21:21.667 --> 21:25.166
No. I think you should go
and stick to your guns.

21:25.233 --> 21:28.266
Right. I've made my decision.
I'm going to stand by it.

21:28.333 --> 21:31.100
No matter what happens,
I'm not going to turn back.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.500
(door closes)

21:33.567 --> 21:37.700
I forgot my raincoat! Silly.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.867
Now what'd you forget?

21:41.934 --> 21:44.000
I forgot to kiss you two goodbye!

21:44.734 --> 21:47.100
-Goodbye, sweetie.
-Goodbye.

21:47.166 --> 21:49.533
Come on now, come on now,
get out of here.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.900
You come back more times
than Shirley MacLaine.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.633
Thank you for flying Air Florida.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.867
Hope you enjoyed your flight.

22:05.934 --> 22:08.400
Thank you for flying Air Florida.
I hope you enjoyed your flight.

22:08.467 --> 22:11.333
Oh, I certainly did,
and I want to especially thank you

22:11.400 --> 22:13.000
for that pillow from first class.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.400
They're so much fluffier.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.100
Oh, you're welcome,
but that was Julie.

22:17.166 --> 22:21.667
I'm the one that got you the Dramamine
and the packs of Smokehouse almonds.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.166
Can I bother you one more time?

22:24.233 --> 22:26.600
Ten packs is all I can give you.

22:26.667 --> 22:28.100
I told you that on the plane.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.467
Oh, I just want to know
which way to the baggage claim.

22:30.533 --> 22:33.233
-Oh.
-Oh, thank you.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.600
And thanks again for the wings.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.567
Rose? I knew that was you.

22:39.633 --> 22:42.900
Lily! Oh, honey,
what are you doing here?

22:42.967 --> 22:45.834
I wanted to surprise you.
Surprise!

22:45.900 --> 22:48.100
Oh, did you come
all this way by yourself?

22:48.166 --> 22:50.800
No, I came with Becky.

22:50.867 --> 22:54.000
Well, Becky, how do you do?

22:54.600 --> 22:57.467
Oh, Rose. I had to see you again

22:57.533 --> 23:00.100
because I felt terrible
about the way we left things.

23:00.166 --> 23:04.900
-Oh, so do I.
-Oh, Rose, I owe you an apology.

23:04.967 --> 23:08.834
I was angry at the world
because I couldn't see it anymore.

23:08.900 --> 23:11.934
That's why I wanted you
to take care of me.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.633
I didn't think it was worth
the effort to do it myself.

23:15.133 --> 23:17.633
But you didn't give me
any other choice.

23:18.166 --> 23:20.500
So I went back to that school,

23:20.567 --> 23:21.834
and once I got out there

23:21.900 --> 23:24.233
and started learning a few things,

23:24.300 --> 23:27.066
I realized that the effort is worth it.

23:27.133 --> 23:28.500
Oh, I still have a long way to go,

23:28.567 --> 23:31.700
but Becky and I are doing okay.

23:31.767 --> 23:33.433
Oh, I feel so silly.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.967
I came out here to talk some sense
into you, and you didn't even need me.

23:37.033 --> 23:39.033
Oh, yes, I did, Rose.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.700
I needed you to see that you were right.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.266
Now, you... excuse me, Becky.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.066
You take my arm. I'm gonna lead you.

23:48.133 --> 23:50.533
Now, Rose, you always had
a terrible sense of direction.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.467
You take my arm. I know the way.

23:52.533 --> 23:55.467
It's 49 steps right down this way.

23:55.533 --> 23:58.600
And watch out for
the wad of gum on the 41st.

23:59.767 --> 24:01.400
I'm so proud of you.

24:01.467 --> 24:03.734
Oh, this is nothing.
Wait till you see me drive home.

24:03.800 --> 24:07.233
Come on, Becky. 1, 2, 3...

24:08.633 --> 24:11.400
(lively music playing)

24:14.467 --> 24:18.066
(closing theme music playing)
