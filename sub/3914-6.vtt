by one principle.
One code.

00:14.306 --> 00:15.421
The warrant is all.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.720
In the name of the RAC,
you are locked and served.

Double booking
a kill warrant?

00:21.563 --> 00:23.940
Someone must really want
this poor bastard dead.

00:25.609 --> 00:26.769
Are you still
having the memory issues?

00:30.739 --> 00:32.900

I killed them!

00:34.952 --> 00:36.567
I can't remember
what I did.

00:36.662 --> 00:37.947
No, no, no, that's
not what I mean.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.240
I mean, why didn't
you tell me?

00:40.457 --> 00:41.913
Don't you even
look at him.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.913
lfl have to, I can
do so much more
than just look.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.456

01:06.650 --> 01:07.685
You're in a mood.

01:08.193 --> 01:12.152
I will help you one
last time, under
these conditions.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.529
lwon't kill for you.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.989
You don't go
near my team.

01:17.828 --> 01:18.863
And when we're done,

01:19.621 --> 01:21.998
you will tell me
what the hell you're
doing in the Quad.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.784
Interesting proposal.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.787
First, I'd need to
know you're still
the Yala I trained.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.162
Well, bad news, there.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.954
Yala died that
night, and she's
not coming back,

01:30.799 --> 01:32.460

01:35.554 --> 01:37.670
If I could let you go
that easily, lwould.

He's a courier.

Find the case
he's smuggling

01:52.863 --> 01:54.945
If you move quickly,
maybe you can save
a few of them.

D'AVIN: Where the hell
would she go?

10:31.464 --> 10:32.544
Should we be worried?

10:32.674 --> 10:33.709
(BEEPING)

10:36.219 --> 10:37.299
Guess not.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.718
"Start without me."

10:38.972 --> 10:40.633
Great, now we're
behind everyone else.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.133
Okay, so, you're
the family thief.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.465
How do we find
a stolen ship?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.801
Oh, hey, hey. I
borrowed a few little
ships in my youth.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.886
I'm not exactly
a high-tech heist expert.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.189
Although I do know one.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.069
JOHN: We're looking for
a Company ship that went dark.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.568
It's going to take a lot more
than cheap wine and
questionable cuisine

10:58.658 --> 10:59.898
to earn that kind of intel.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.990
We had a deal.
Deals are made to be broken.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.409
So are fingers and necks.

11:03.872 --> 11:04.907
(LAUGHS)

11:07.876 --> 11:10.663
I watched a man get
his eyes pulled out

11:10.753 --> 11:12.254
through his nose
the other day.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.505
That's what they
do in here for fun.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.091
A trip to the infirmary?
Hmm...

11:20.096 --> 11:21.552
That's a vacation.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.597
That's a Qresh Finance
Center account under
your sister's name.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.601
Now I'm not sure
that I would have

11:29.689 --> 11:31.350
laundered my savings
that way, but hey...

11:31.858 --> 11:32.893
(CHUCKLES)

11:33.610 --> 11:34.599
You're a dead man.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.021
No, I'm a creative
negotiator

11:36.112 --> 11:38.103
who stuck a re-tread
virus on your
account's outflow.

11:39.782 --> 11:40.908
You see that
number there?

11:41.618 --> 11:42.903
The one that
keeps dropping?

11:43.369 --> 11:44.620
That's your nest egg.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.448
Cracking.

11:46.789 --> 11:47.869
When I get out
of here...

11:47.957 --> 11:49.367
You'll be broke
as shit.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.458
Unless you tell us
how to find that ship.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.234
(DEVICE BEEPING)

12:21.824 --> 12:22.813
(GASPS)

12:23.910 --> 12:25.571
Well, that was
just creepy.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.990
We're going to need
to get you a bell.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.075
Are you really here?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.155
KHLYEN: Not physically.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.123
Our brains are
connected by
the neuro-Iink.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.496
You'll get used to it.

12:34.837 --> 12:35.826
DUTCH: Doubt it.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.172
KHLYEN: So, tell me
about this thief.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.795
You seem to know
him quite well.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.919
DUTCH: Big Joe?
He's not a thief.
He's a Killjoy.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.004
He stole something.
That makes him a thief.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.265
You kill people.
That makes you
a murderer.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.347
That's true.
But what does
that make you?

12:55.149 --> 12:56.480
Still working
that one out.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.770
You know, there's
not a Killjoy

12:58.861 --> 13:00.692
who doesn't owe
Big Joe a debt or a drink.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.653
He's notjust a friend,
he's a mentor.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.480
A mentor? Hmm.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.445
Am I meant to be
jealous about that?

13:06.828 --> 13:09.160
Of course not,
that would require
you to have feelings.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.037
You see, I miss
this camaraderie.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.706
In the last 12 hours,
there have been more
encrypted messages

13:13.793 --> 13:16.205
coming out of Company
security than in
the last year.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.290
What's on that ship is
very valuable to them.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.379
Which makes it
valuable to us.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.499
Ideas what it could be?

13:23.011 --> 13:24.626
Use your
differential analysis.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.176
Walk me through
the options.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.220
Like old times.

13:34.689 --> 13:35.724
Nice try.

13:36.399 --> 13:39.391
Don't care.
One lastjob and
then we're through.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.227
Whatever's on that ship
has nothing to do with me.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.899
Hello, gorgeous.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.573
Dutch, this is D'avin.
We're ready to go.
Respond.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.077
Lucy, check her com.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.746
LUCY: Coms have
been disengaged.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.374
On purpose?
Why would she do that?

14:01.758 --> 14:02.918
Okay, now, we worry.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.336
LUCY: Ramp engaging.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.008
You doing that?
No.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.842
I thought this
thing had locks.

14:10.933 --> 14:14.596
Trace powder,
custom blend,
works on every keypad.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.356
No matter how
much you clean up
after yourself,

14:17.440 --> 14:18.850
I know where your
fingers have been.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.192
Now, Ijust
feel dirty.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.777
Did Coren tell you
how to find Big Joe?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.021
No idea what you're
talking about.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.694
I know you were there.
I know what Coren does.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.693
And I know
you left smiling.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.783
I may be pretty,
but I can do math.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.282
Get off my ship, Fancy.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.870
You're filling it
with douche bag.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.743
Oh, so, you don't
want to know
where Dutch is?

14:37.585 --> 14:38.620
Fine with me.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.414
D'AVIN: Johnny...

14:42.090 --> 14:43.125
Wait.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.628
What do you know?

14:46.761 --> 14:47.876
She flew out
of Dock Nine

14:47.970 --> 14:50.882
in an unmarked cruiser
two hours ago. Alone.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.259
My guess? She's off
to get Joe herself.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.594
Personal history
and all.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.676
I can respect that.
D'AVIN: You're an
asshole, Fancy.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.056
You don't have
respect for anything.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.267
What do you want?
FANCY: To win.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.231
You know where
Joe's ship is,

15:02.318 --> 15:04.900
but he'll be long
gone by the time
we're there.

15:05.488 --> 15:08.104
Take me to the site and
I'll use the Bloodhound
to do the rest.

15:08.533 --> 15:09.818
We split the warrant.
No.

15:10.701 --> 15:11.736
We'll do it.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.534
What? Why?

15:13.621 --> 15:15.452
Because he's right.
Dutch and Joe go
way back.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.997
She's probablyjust
trying to help him
without getting us involved.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.163
Which means she's about
to get herself in shit
ifwe don't stop her.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.413
FANCY: We've got ourselves
a road trip, huh, boys?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.207
I call shotgun.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.129
(SIGHS)

15:30.680 --> 15:31.715
Remember.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.588
It's impolite
to shoot a guest.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.763
DUTCH: This case was the only
thing left on the ship.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.643
Whatever's inside,
looks like Big Joe
took with him.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.442
What's wrong?

15:48.156 --> 15:49.191
What was in there?

15:49.657 --> 15:50.942
Something the Company
would never let

15:51.033 --> 15:52.694
you or your Joe
walk away with.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.034
Find it and
bring it to me now.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.370
The hell are you
getting me caught up in,

15:57.457 --> 15:59.413
in this little
reunion tour of yours?

16:00.918 --> 16:02.624
Start talking or
I start walking.

16:05.715 --> 16:06.750
Fine.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.712
(GUNSHOT)
Ah!

16:10.887 --> 16:11.967
Yala!

16:14.932 --> 16:16.342
JOHN:
What's our status, Loose?

16:16.434 --> 16:18.220
LUCY: Five minutes
until landing.

16:19.770 --> 16:20.930
Docking completed.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.605
We got you here.
Now you get us to Dutch.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.855
I spent the last two hours
not punching him.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.281
I should have
been punching him.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.070
I'm just messing
with you, man.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.402
This is the Bloodhound.

16:38.789 --> 16:39.824
How does it work?

16:39.916 --> 16:42.282
Automated chemoreceptor,
built it myself.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.991
Just needs something
Dutch touched.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.043
Underwear, bra...

16:46.964 --> 16:47.999
Pervert.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.171
I suppose that'll do.

17:01.479 --> 17:02.935
(COUGHS AND GASPS)

17:03.856 --> 17:06.313
Slowly. Slowly.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

17:07.985 --> 17:09.020
(GROANS)

17:10.196 --> 17:11.606
KHLYEN: Your friends
always shoot at you?

17:11.989 --> 17:13.604
If he had better aim,
you'd be dead.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.618
If he wanted me dead...

17:20.331 --> 17:22.196
(GRUNTING)

17:22.875 --> 17:23.910
lwould be.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.991
This was just
to slow me down.

17:28.839 --> 17:29.874
(GROANS)

17:30.007 --> 17:31.213
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

17:31.300 --> 17:32.380
He's going to escape.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.055
No.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.717
But he's going to try.

17:46.774 --> 17:50.813
Heard you Killjoys
had some big
meeting here today.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.439
Anything the Company
should know about?

17:54.156 --> 17:55.657
You still drinking
that burner fuel?

17:55.741 --> 17:56.992
What's Hills drinking?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.156
No.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.442
Whatever you're
about to pull,

17:59.537 --> 18:02.324
if it's for D'avin,
there are other ways
to scratch that itch.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.742
What's wrong with
my sexers?

18:03.833 --> 18:06.040
I treat them all.
Conflict of duty.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.038
You treat D'avin, too.
What do you call that?

18:08.212 --> 18:10.453
Occupational hazard.
And really good sex.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.004
I have a soft spot
for broken boys.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.756
Oh. Because ifyou
fix them, they need you,

18:14.844 --> 18:16.926
and if they need you,
they'll stay. Hmm?

18:18.514 --> 18:19.629
Did you just
shrink me?

18:20.057 --> 18:22.048
Hmm. Occupational hazard.

18:22.768 --> 18:26.101
I forgot that
everything on Westerley
has an ugly aftertaste.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.266
(CHUCKLES) You know
what I remember?

18:28.733 --> 18:32.021
When the RAC was
just happy being
our errand boys.

18:32.778 --> 18:37.021
Yeah, well,
times change, Hills.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.159
Whether we like it or not.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.114
Friendly warning,
for old times' sake.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.290
Whatever you're up to
here, keep it quiet.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.624
There's only so much
I can look away from

18:49.712 --> 18:51.623
before I've gotta
kick it upstairs.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.334
Mmm.

19:01.599 --> 19:02.679
That for me?

19:03.559 --> 19:04.890
Doctor's orders.

19:16.447 --> 19:17.653
D'AVIN: Why are we stopping?

19:17.740 --> 19:18.775
Did you find something?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.280
Blood.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.529
D'AVIN: It's from Dutch.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.952
Blood, fibers and powder.
She's been shot.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.447
Track faster.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.747
Hope you're hungry.
I made your favorite.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.882
Giving up, old man?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.553
I knew I couldn't
slow you down for long.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.965
Sorry about the shoulder.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.394
But you're welcome
for me missing the artery.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.479
You always could
thread the needle.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.771
There's a black
warrant on you, Joe.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.313
You come to lay
hands on me, Dutchie?

20:07.164 --> 20:08.540
(BOTH LAUGHING)

20:08.624 --> 20:10.535
I missed you, kiddo.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.661
(LAUGHS)

20:12.420 --> 20:14.376
A dozen Killjoys
are heading here.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.421
I'm just here
for what you stole.

20:18.884 --> 20:23.628
But I know if I try to
get it, you'd probably...

20:23.723 --> 20:25.213
Yup. (GRUNTS)

20:25.307 --> 20:26.387
And then...

20:27.101 --> 20:28.181
(BIG JOE LAUGHING)

20:28.811 --> 20:29.846
Uh-huh.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.352
(BOTH STRUGGLING)

20:31.605 --> 20:34.187
You're still
a little bit loose
on the right side.

20:35.651 --> 20:36.731
(BOTH GRUNTING)

20:36.819 --> 20:38.605
You're still
predictable.

20:38.821 --> 20:39.901
(BIG JOE GROANS)

20:43.701 --> 20:45.362
Old dog, old tricks.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.747
I'm tired of old dogs
disappointing me today.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.827
Just be one of
the good ones. Please.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.033
I'm trying to be.
Now, listen to me.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.540
For your own good,
get out of here.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.665
(GRUNTS)

20:58.966 --> 21:00.672
I don't want you
caught up in this.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.380
In what?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.795
This can't be how
you end your career.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.514
Legendary Killjoy

21:08.601 --> 21:11.434
caught and caged like
some kind of animal.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.135
How do you think
it ends, Dutch?

21:14.440 --> 21:15.475
You think they
throw us a parade

21:15.566 --> 21:17.022
when they take
back our badges?

21:19.069 --> 21:20.149
They don't.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.028
The RAC uses us up

21:23.115 --> 21:25.527
and then they toss us
aside when they're
done with us.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.196
The only reason our
beloved brotherhood

21:28.287 --> 21:30.494
is interested in
my ancient ass at all

21:30.581 --> 21:32.037
is because my name's
on a warrant.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.581
And because of this.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.293
I'm not working
a warrant, Joe.
You can leave.

21:38.756 --> 21:41.498
Ijust need this.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.541
Well, now, that's
gonna be a problem.

21:46.347 --> 21:47.632
Because so do I.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.422
INNIS: We said come alone!

21:52.686 --> 21:53.766
What the hell is this?
Who's she?

21:53.854 --> 21:55.230
I got no idea, Innis.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.232
Never seen her
before in my life.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.024
Well, if you two
don't know each other,

22:00.110 --> 22:02.021
then she won't care if
I blow off your head.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.484
Three.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.650
Two.
(PANTING)

22:17.002 --> 22:19.493
Captured. No doubt
because of him.

22:20.089 --> 22:23.172
I told you friendship
makes you weak. Do you
believe me, now?

22:23.259 --> 22:24.339
Shut up.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.506
I didn't say anything.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.842
And I told you to run.

22:28.222 --> 22:30.713
And I told you
I need what you stole.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.561
Wish I knew what
the hell it was.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.722
(LAUGHS)

22:36.814 --> 22:37.929
Yeah, me, too.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.478
What? You don't
know what it is?

22:42.736 --> 22:44.442
Why did you steal it,
you idiot?

22:47.575 --> 22:51.193
I get my kicks
targeting the ships
with the most security,

22:51.829 --> 22:53.660
thumbing my nose
at the Company.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.033
Most of the time,

22:55.124 --> 22:57.285
they come with
pretty good cargo,
but this time...

22:58.335 --> 23:00.326
Just that one
tiny ass little box.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.166
But if the Company
wants it, it's got value.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.713
What happened to you, Joe?

23:07.553 --> 23:08.588
Life.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.841
The Kotlers here are
political radicals.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.047
True Leithians.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.262
I was serving a warrant
to one of their sons

23:16.353 --> 23:17.934
and they paid me to
look the other way.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.099
Pretty soon, they just
started paying me

23:20.190 --> 23:21.270
to steal them things.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.899
Guns, mostly. Lots ofguns.

23:27.573 --> 23:28.608
Look.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.781
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this, Dutch.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.950
I was a much better
man when you knew me.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.535
You're still
a better man than some.

23:45.716 --> 23:46.751
Lucas.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.629
Listen, brother.
You've got to let her go.
You've got to let her go.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.005
This is a misunderstanding.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.593
If he hurts you,
I will take his hands.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.770
I apologize, miss.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.930
Sometimes, my son has
more passion than sense.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.730
INNIS: She's a lying,
dirty Westerlyn.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.559
Let's just string her up,
her and her pig friend.

24:07.321 --> 24:09.152
Your family's
a wee bit racist.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.649
My son is a patriot.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.784
We believe in
a pure Leith.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.075
We had an
arrangement with Joe.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.823
Only, when we
come to collect,

24:16.914 --> 24:18.245
he's with another RAC agent

24:18.332 --> 24:19.697
and some device nobody seems

24:19.792 --> 24:20.998
to be able to identify.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.996
So, tell me. What are
your people planning?

24:23.087 --> 24:24.793
Is this reconnaissance
for a raid?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.666
No, I already told you.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.250
What's this
on your neck here?

24:33.347 --> 24:34.962
Don't!
(GROANS IN PAIN)

They're spies.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.643
Find out what
the hells is going on.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.733
BIG JOE: No. Wait, let's talk!

24:47.987 --> 24:49.693
Trust me,
you will talk.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.822
You'll both talk.

Are you a born Westie?

25:08.048 --> 25:09.549
Yeah, fifth generation.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.965
Wow, so, your

25:12.052 --> 25:13.508
Good for you. (LAUGHS)

25:14.513 --> 25:15.923
Damn right.

25:16.473 --> 25:20.637
They'll be making
the jump to Leith
when they open the gates.

25:22.271 --> 25:25.559
Got a nice little plot
picked out for
them there already.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.942
The Company's been
good to me in that way.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.147
They should be.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.984

putting on that uniform.

you've got to do,
to take care of your own.

is coming out. Let's go.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.368
Probably have
an arsenal in there.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.454
We need an actual plan.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.164
You two hang back,
take care of the guards.

26:30.464 --> 26:31.704
I'll take the door
and grab Dutch.

decided

28:17.738 --> 28:19.569
to come in and steal
it from under us

here on surveillance.

you are coming?

work like that.

somebody else.

that ifyou were even
slightly less of a dick,

want to work with you?

33:16.703 --> 33:19.820
Any chance I
could still take that
go-on-get-out-of-here option?

33:19.915 --> 33:23.157
DUTCH: The black warrant
still stands, Joe.
They'll find you.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.785
Call ahead to Turin.

33:27.631 --> 33:29.087
Tell him we're
coming in hot.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.213
All of us.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.254
Maybe we can trade
the bomb for mercy.

33:48.401 --> 33:49.732
(CROWD CHEERING)

33:52.739 --> 33:53.774
Shut it.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.364
Agent Siano.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.609
You're lucky
the RAC found you
before the Company did.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.581
And you, don't
expect applause for
doing your damn job.

34:04.751 --> 34:06.287
Listen, right now,
we've got bigger problems.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.585
The only problem
I see is you're
a pain in my ass.

34:08.672 --> 34:09.707
HILLS: Funny.

34:10.131 --> 34:12.338
I was just about to say
the very same thing.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.086
I've got a bitch
of a headache,

34:14.177 --> 34:16.668
and the Company's
kicked into crisis mode,

34:16.763 --> 34:19.049
and Killjoys
is the watchword.

34:19.349 --> 34:21.590
Now, somebody better
tell me what's
going on here.

34:21.685 --> 34:22.720
It's about this.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.684
I took it from
a Company ship.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.348
And this is
what it does.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.688
What the hell's
the Company up to, Hills?

34:29.276 --> 34:30.982
Why do they need
a weapon like this?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.107
With me.

34:39.703 --> 34:40.738
Whew!

34:41.788 --> 34:43.824
Still got your brand, Big J.

is on the house.

35:00.098 --> 35:03.636
Killjoys, Company guards.
I count maybe 15.

35:05.687 --> 35:06.722
Shitty odds.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.062
We've gotten out of worse.

35:09.482 --> 35:10.517
What do you say?

35:12.444 --> 35:13.650
One more time?
You and me?

35:20.577 --> 35:22.533
I can'tjust turn
him over to you.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.453
Turin, we've got him
dead to rights.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.077
We both know what
happens to Killjoys
in a Companyjail.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.783
My people will not
sign off on that.

35:30.795 --> 35:34.208
And when my people
hear a RAC agent
robbed our ships

35:34.299 --> 35:36.665
and exposed
a blacklist weapon,

35:36.760 --> 35:38.671
they won't sign off
on anything less.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.927
Things are already tense
between our two sides.

35:45.018 --> 35:47.384
Let's not light
that match tonight.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.064
Something’s gotta give.

I could, Joe.

Just do it fast.
No.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.099
Come on.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.189
I don't want to
spend my last days
as a target.

36:37.612 --> 36:38.647
Please.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.108
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
No.

put hands on you.

serves a purpose.

I came to the Quad?

leaving without you.

I have a few
highborn Qreshi
connections myself.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.173
I asked about you.

39:51.306 --> 39:52.716
Actually,
a little problem.

39:53.641 --> 39:57.884
No one back on Qresh
gives a shit what
happens to you here,

39:57.979 --> 40:00.937
so I'm going to give
you one last chance

40:01.024 --> 40:02.309
to help yourself.

it is, then.

it's time that I be

no more disappearing
acts and you've...

Khlyen found me.

We can leave. We can, uh...

We can go off the grid,
anywhere you want.

I grew up in.

41:00.875 --> 41:04.208
Not entirely sure, now,
what he was even
training me for.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.420
What do you need?

41:07.757 --> 41:09.213
I need this to stop.

41:11.552 --> 41:15.886
Which means
I need your help.

even bigger targets

are right now.

remember?

we're in.

not in anger.

that bomb scares him.

I need you to figure out

41:48.464 --> 41:49.624
a way to track him
down with this.

41:54.429 --> 41:58.263
I'm tired of
playing defense.

42:01.144 --> 42:03.851
We've belled the beast,
and now we're going after him.

42:04.605 --> 42:06.106
And what do we do
when we find him?

42:08.651 --> 42:09.766
I'm gonna kill him.

Somehow.
