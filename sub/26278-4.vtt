00:49.749 --> 00:51.469
Morning, Murdoch.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.792
Standing room only, I'm afraid.

00:53.917 --> 00:56.543
Must be a result of
this new Immigration Act?

00:56.607 --> 00:59.213
It's been a steady stream all morning.

00:59.338 --> 01:02.292
Listen to that incessant
chatter; it's worse than Italian.

01:02.417 --> 01:05.975
Still, good to see British
order being implemented.

01:05.977 --> 01:07.676
This must be him.

01:07.946 --> 01:11.165
James McBride. From the
Ministry of the Interior.

01:11.218 --> 01:12.657
He may be cleaning up the city,

01:12.664 --> 01:14.644
- but he's a right royal pain in the...
- Inspector.

01:14.668 --> 01:16.331
We are running out of space.

01:16.341 --> 01:18.717
- I'll need you to open up the back cells.
- Bloody hell,

01:18.756 --> 01:20.370
how many more are you anticipating?

01:20.387 --> 01:23.466
We will be finished once every
name is struck from this list.

01:23.513 --> 01:25.489
Now, if you would.

01:26.097 --> 01:27.397
Follow me.

01:43.654 --> 01:44.997
What are they doing, sir?

01:45.014 --> 01:46.610
And why are they all Greek?

01:46.884 --> 01:50.503
Any immigrant charged with a
crime is eligible for deportation.

01:50.516 --> 01:53.032
I gather these men all
have criminal records.

01:53.058 --> 01:55.182
So what, they'll all
get sent back to Greece?

01:55.237 --> 01:56.609
I suppose so.

01:56.892 --> 01:59.231
Although it is strange
that they all seem to be

01:59.243 --> 02:01.025
of the same nationality.

02:01.059 --> 02:03.874
I'm afraid I can't give you
an exact deportation date,

02:03.901 --> 02:05.501
but we will work through it efficiently.

02:05.817 --> 02:08.846
I trust I can expect
your full cooperation.

02:08.869 --> 02:11.041
- Of course.
- So, sir.

02:11.077 --> 02:12.882
What happens with them when
they get back to Greece?

02:12.906 --> 02:15.651
Oh, who bloody cares,
Crabtree? They're criminals.

02:15.671 --> 02:18.647
Our main concern is removing
them from Canadian soil.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.058
The government's
responsibility ends there.

02:21.110 --> 02:23.250
Now if you'll excuse me.

02:23.469 --> 02:25.784
I should get back to it as well, sir.

02:27.776 --> 02:29.143
Inspector!

02:29.386 --> 02:30.968
Athos? What are you doing in here?

02:30.972 --> 02:32.403
Please, I did nothing!

02:32.528 --> 02:34.635
I'll take him, Constable. Come here.

02:35.169 --> 02:37.560
- Were you charged with a crime?
- Never.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.867
You're the finest
carpenter I've ever seen.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.895
Margaret still talks about that
bloody buffet that you built us.

02:42.919 --> 02:44.784
Inspector, this is a mistake.

02:46.947 --> 02:49.191
- Clear off and keep your head down.
- Thank you.

02:49.693 --> 02:52.047
Just because you're out of here,
doesn't mean you're out of trouble.

02:52.071 --> 02:53.489
Come on. I'll walk you out.

02:54.346 --> 02:55.573
This way.

03:02.414 --> 03:04.848
The night watchman startled
somebody who ran off,

03:04.884 --> 03:07.773
but he said he was pushing a
wheelbarrow with something in it

03:07.805 --> 03:09.343
that might have been a body.

03:10.036 --> 03:11.674
What might have been a body?

03:11.749 --> 03:13.912
He was too scared to check, sir.

03:14.685 --> 03:16.323
Help me unroll it.

03:31.247 --> 03:33.989
- My God. Isn't that...
- Mr. McBride.

03:34.443 --> 03:36.239
The Immigration Officer.

03:44.025 --> 03:47.045
Significant trauma to
the front of the skull.

03:47.396 --> 03:51.200
There appears to be some bruising
under the right eye, as well.

03:51.783 --> 03:53.734
It's the list of deportees.

03:55.932 --> 03:58.532
The man kept impeccable notes.

03:58.547 --> 04:00.907
There appear to be some
additional defensive wounds.

04:00.927 --> 04:03.617
I won't be certain until I
can get him to the morgue.

04:03.641 --> 04:07.740
So do you suppose he was being
delivered or being taken away?

04:11.714 --> 04:14.249
Perhaps Mr. Copley can help answer that.

04:14.329 --> 04:17.630
George, stay with Miss Hart
until the morgue wagon arrives.

04:17.636 --> 04:19.011
Sir.

04:19.857 --> 04:21.971
Gentlemen, if you'd move along,

04:21.983 --> 04:24.064
we'll need to talk to everybody shortly.

04:24.189 --> 04:26.474
You say that he was rolled up in a rug?

04:27.040 --> 04:30.199
Presumably to be transported
in the wheelbarrow.

04:30.434 --> 04:31.709
Barbaric.

04:32.211 --> 04:36.064
One of those immigrants
killed him, obviously.

04:36.733 --> 04:39.300
What was your relationship
to Mr. McBride?

04:39.320 --> 04:40.790
I knew of him,

04:40.821 --> 04:43.714
but we hadn't actually
met until Frank hired him.

04:43.758 --> 04:45.507
- Frank?
- Oliver.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.754
- The Minister of the Interior?
- Yes.

04:48.774 --> 04:50.687
The architect of this Immigration Act.

04:50.699 --> 04:52.180
Frank and I are old friends.

04:52.196 --> 04:56.674
In fact, I'll be saying a few
words after his speech on Saturday.

04:57.077 --> 04:59.985
Bring the family, show your support.

05:00.146 --> 05:02.021
_

05:02.309 --> 05:07.490
Is it possible that Mr. McBride
came searching for deportees?

05:07.776 --> 05:09.937
Do you know who I am?

05:10.184 --> 05:13.076
Copley Construction built
this city... by Canadians,

05:13.088 --> 05:15.382
for Canadians.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.564
I don't hire people that
aren't part of the union.

05:23.021 --> 05:24.201
Eliza,

05:24.607 --> 05:27.649
what part of 'knock before
entering' don't you understand?

05:27.664 --> 05:29.198
Men are talking here.

05:29.253 --> 05:31.733
Excuse me, Mr. Copley.

05:31.738 --> 05:34.699
- I thought you wanted me to empty the ashtrays.
- Later.

05:35.241 --> 05:37.863
Come back later.

05:46.147 --> 05:48.195
When did you last see Mr. McBride?

05:48.207 --> 05:49.757
Quite a while.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.673
But I do know that he went to
see Andrew Palmer yesterday.

05:53.697 --> 05:56.542
- And who is that?
- He calls himself a construction man,

05:56.562 --> 05:57.981
but he's a huckster.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.778
- Couldn't build a dollhouse.
- How do you know he went there?

06:00.782 --> 06:03.384
My union representative,
Paul Scotch, had a meeting.

06:03.854 --> 06:05.165
He saw McBride.

06:06.149 --> 06:08.476
What were you doing
at Mr. Palmer's office?

06:08.858 --> 06:11.217
Trying to convince him
to do the right thing,

06:11.305 --> 06:13.947
hire some of my men for
the Malvern Collegiate job.

06:14.274 --> 06:15.676
He refused, of course.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.509
Yes, I read about that.

06:17.552 --> 06:19.623
It's quite the undertaking,
from what I understand.

06:19.655 --> 06:21.938
It'll be the largest
school the city's seen.

06:22.448 --> 06:25.720
Damn thing probably won't even stay
upright, if he ever does finish it.

06:26.123 --> 06:28.609
And you said he won't use union workers?

06:28.652 --> 06:30.453
He's hiring immigrants.

06:30.532 --> 06:32.672
It was the only way he
could keep costs low enough

06:32.692 --> 06:35.147
to scrape a bid together.
The man is shameless.

06:35.207 --> 06:36.828
No sense of brotherhood.

06:36.953 --> 06:38.063
I see.

06:38.188 --> 06:41.299
And would you happen to know
what Mr. McBride was doing there?

06:41.542 --> 06:44.753
Looking for more people to toss out
of the country, would be my guess.

06:46.542 --> 06:48.184
He showed me a list of names.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.153
Said he wanted the addresses of
all my workers who were on it.

06:51.492 --> 06:53.050
- And you gave them to him?
- Names.

06:53.106 --> 06:54.624
What was I supposed to do?

06:55.110 --> 06:56.616
I can't fight the law.

06:57.662 --> 06:59.489
Might this have been the list?

07:00.713 --> 07:02.399
Yeah, this is it.

07:03.168 --> 07:06.156
Three quarters of the
names on here were my men.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.009
Hmm.

07:08.033 --> 07:10.719
And I take it construction
was to commence shortly?

07:10.742 --> 07:11.934
Two damn days.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.473
Now I have to find enough
labourers with the right skills

07:14.492 --> 07:17.122
who are willing to work
for less than union wages.

07:17.174 --> 07:18.911
Why not simply go through the unions?

07:18.927 --> 07:20.883
There are maybe three
contractors in the city

07:20.895 --> 07:22.557
who can afford to use unions.

07:22.596 --> 07:25.681
The rest of us get the
small time jobs, the crumbs.

07:25.697 --> 07:28.633
I finally found a way to get
the city's foot off my neck,

07:28.677 --> 07:30.179
and this happens.

07:30.347 --> 07:32.248
It seems to me you were
looking to prove a point

07:32.251 --> 07:36.028
- by securing this contract.
- I was looking to level the playing field.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.921
If I make a little money
along the way, all the better.

07:39.046 --> 07:42.794
Besides, these men get a
chance to feed their families.

07:43.204 --> 07:44.862
Is that so wrong?

07:46.511 --> 07:49.320
Do you know where Mr. McBride
went after he left here?

07:49.332 --> 07:51.934
Probably over to Carlton
where the Greeks live.

07:52.059 --> 07:54.519
He left with the addresses, like I said.

07:55.109 --> 07:57.639
- And what did you do at that time?
- Me?

07:57.699 --> 07:58.954
I was right here,

07:58.990 --> 08:01.969
trying to figure out a way to
dig myself out of this mess.

08:03.515 --> 08:05.356
Alright, next.

08:06.452 --> 08:07.683
Next.

08:08.862 --> 08:12.224
Retrace Mr. McBride's steps
after he left Mr. Palmer's office.

08:12.232 --> 08:14.739
There's a good chance he
went to the Greek part of town

08:14.747 --> 08:16.082
immediately afterwards.

08:16.126 --> 08:17.851
- Sir.
- If Palmer's telling the truth,

08:17.871 --> 08:19.875
McBride was very much alive
when he left his office.

08:19.891 --> 08:22.293
Heading off to the land of
fish and phyllo, are you?

08:22.418 --> 08:24.034
You'll be able to
practice more of that Greek

08:24.042 --> 08:26.150
that you picked up
yesterday. You almost had it.

08:26.489 --> 08:28.947
I'll see if Miss Hart has
completed her post-mortem.

08:28.983 --> 08:30.166
I'll join you.

08:30.963 --> 08:33.995
I believe it's filo, sir. Fish and filo.

08:35.179 --> 08:38.039
Ah, Detective, I'm afraid
I'll be needing that.

08:38.164 --> 08:39.980
The philosopher's tongue.

08:39.996 --> 08:42.063
Now, do you have a special
interest in Hellenic

08:42.087 --> 08:45.183
- or all Indo-European languages?
- What?

08:45.577 --> 08:48.936
No. Watts, have you not noticed
our cells are full of Greek men?

08:48.964 --> 08:51.200
Actually I was speaking
to a few of them earlier

08:51.223 --> 08:52.985
and they were quite distraught.

08:53.188 --> 08:56.957
This whole concept of borders
has always been puzzling to me.

08:57.029 --> 08:59.033
Wait, you speak Greek?

08:59.053 --> 09:01.683
- A few simple phrases.
- Well, that's wonderful.

09:01.703 --> 09:03.771
I have to go down to Greektown
right now for the McBride case.

09:03.782 --> 09:04.875
Maybe you'd come with me?

09:04.895 --> 09:08.501
I suppose I could
provide some assistance.

09:09.541 --> 09:11.007
Have you eaten?

09:11.270 --> 09:12.378
Eaten?

09:17.140 --> 09:19.778
The blow crushed his skull,
killing him instantly.

09:19.830 --> 09:22.715
The fragmentation indicates
a heavy object was used,

09:22.754 --> 09:24.492
with at least two sharp corners.

09:24.555 --> 09:26.316
And the bruising on his face?

09:26.441 --> 09:28.292
Consistent with being punched.

09:28.316 --> 09:30.659
So he most likely
fought with his attacker.

09:30.784 --> 09:33.095
The wounds on his hands
would suggest a struggle,

09:33.103 --> 09:35.302
but it is difficult to determine
whether they were sustained

09:35.321 --> 09:37.158
before or during the murder.

09:37.413 --> 09:38.604
Must have been during.

09:38.624 --> 09:40.433
He was fine when he came to the Station.

09:41.146 --> 09:42.553
And the time of death?

09:42.824 --> 09:44.868
Just a few hours before he was found,

09:44.993 --> 09:46.892
at most. He hadn't been there very long.

09:47.517 --> 09:50.175
So a rough timeline would
have him leaving Palmer's,

09:50.191 --> 09:53.865
going to Greektown, and then
to wherever he was murdered.

09:54.614 --> 09:57.545
- We'll know more once George gets back.
- Why wait?

09:57.670 --> 09:59.519
We can handle the Athenians ourselves.

09:59.997 --> 10:03.081
- Come on. Miss Hart.
- Miss Hart.

10:23.321 --> 10:24.944
Are you eating again?

10:25.107 --> 10:27.478
A minute ago you were face
and eyes into a souvlaki.

10:27.490 --> 10:30.330
Yes, but this is dessert. Baklava.

10:30.346 --> 10:32.387
- Would you care for a nibble?
- No.

10:32.475 --> 10:34.738
We're supposed to be finding
out where McBride went.

10:36.546 --> 10:38.048
Nobody will talk to me.

10:38.132 --> 10:40.044
Right. Well, he was here for a while

10:40.064 --> 10:43.008
to make arrests but then
left to go to the hospital.

10:44.112 --> 10:45.510
How did you find that out?

10:45.980 --> 10:47.191
Nostimo.

10:47.757 --> 10:50.147
Food is an important
part of this culture.

10:50.645 --> 10:54.483
You eat, you talk, you learn things.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.351
Are you quite sure you don't want one?

10:59.157 --> 11:00.376
Two.

11:02.249 --> 11:04.428
No, this one here.

11:05.659 --> 11:07.281
And how has it been feeling?

11:07.600 --> 11:08.995
It's all right?

11:10.082 --> 11:11.293
Open your mouth

11:11.620 --> 11:13.883
- and say 'ah'.
- Ah.

11:14.377 --> 11:15.684
Very good.

11:18.318 --> 11:20.123
He'll need his tonsils out.

11:20.398 --> 11:22.004
Oh, what a surprise!

11:22.339 --> 11:23.689
Dr. Ogden.

11:23.710 --> 11:24.733
I should get accustomed

11:24.745 --> 11:26.426
to seeing you working
amongst the living, I suppose.

11:26.446 --> 11:27.960
What are you two doing here?

11:28.004 --> 11:30.547
You're not part of this
deportation business, I hope.

11:30.567 --> 11:31.973
In a roundabout way.

11:31.981 --> 11:35.499
The man in charge of the
sweep, James McBride...

11:35.659 --> 11:37.316
he was found dead last night.

11:37.336 --> 11:39.432
Apparently he was here
shortly beforehand.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.922
Have either of you seen him?

11:41.253 --> 11:42.444
I did.

11:42.663 --> 11:45.901
He got into a physical altercation
with someone down the hall.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.367
Nurse Sullivan? He
fought with a patient?

11:48.410 --> 11:50.496
A visitor, actually.

11:50.621 --> 11:52.658
The man who assaulted Mr. McBride

11:52.688 --> 11:54.566
ran out before anyone could stop him.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.234
Did you treat McBride?

11:56.269 --> 11:59.740
No, he refused. Said he
had more patients to assess.

12:00.124 --> 12:02.309
Could you identify the assailant?

12:02.389 --> 12:03.913
Oh, I'm not sure.

12:03.972 --> 12:06.473
I do remember he had an accent, though.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.342
But he was visiting someone in room ten.

12:10.522 --> 12:12.395
I could check the visitor's log.

12:13.769 --> 12:17.286
Perfect notes. I'd half expect
him to detail his own murder.

12:17.301 --> 12:20.090
- That would make things much easier.
- So, these names...

12:20.130 --> 12:21.676
it could be the first
person who was crossed off,

12:21.677 --> 12:22.916
or the last person who isn't.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.678
Or a relative of
someone who was arrested,

12:25.682 --> 12:27.646
or was about to be arrested.

12:27.771 --> 12:30.627
Needle in a haystack,
then. As usual. Excellent.

12:31.476 --> 12:32.803
Inspector!

12:34.608 --> 12:38.792
Oh, the vultures are here
to pick the bones clean.

12:39.114 --> 12:41.079
Any comments on the McBride murder?

12:41.286 --> 12:43.231
None whatsoever, Miss Cherry.

12:43.566 --> 12:45.702
Do you believe a Greek
person was involved?

12:45.913 --> 12:49.112
Are the words "none whatsoever"
in a language you don't understand?

12:50.903 --> 12:52.281
Inspector!

12:52.325 --> 12:55.417
- How good to see you.
- Athos Rella, Detective Murdoch.

12:55.831 --> 12:59.127
Athos is the master carpenter
who made our cabinetry.

12:59.252 --> 13:01.669
Oh yes, I recall Mrs.
Brackenreid mentioning

13:01.673 --> 13:04.395
the buffet you made several times.

13:04.443 --> 13:07.173
We need some information
on the man, McBride.

13:07.201 --> 13:09.898
- Did you hear anything?
- I have. Terrible.

13:10.244 --> 13:12.893
Do you know if anyone on this list

13:12.945 --> 13:14.416
could be involved in the murder?

13:14.464 --> 13:16.105
You think a Greek did this?

13:16.875 --> 13:20.053
Well, most of the names here are Greek.

13:20.077 --> 13:21.484
If you could have a look.

13:23.306 --> 13:24.680
I know many of these men,

13:24.696 --> 13:26.744
but I don't believe any
could do what you say.

13:26.836 --> 13:29.502
We were all afraid and angry
at him for doing this to us,

13:29.514 --> 13:30.749
but I cannot imagine it.

13:30.805 --> 13:33.750
- If you do hear anything, let us know.
- Of course.

13:34.492 --> 13:35.770
Inspector,

13:35.838 --> 13:37.821
my wife and I, we are so grateful.

13:37.822 --> 13:39.348
Because of you, we can stay.

13:39.384 --> 13:42.599
- Please, you must come over for dinner...
- That's fine, just fine.

13:42.611 --> 13:44.015
Stay out of trouble.

13:46.704 --> 13:47.776
Sir?

13:47.991 --> 13:49.657
Look, I spared him from the cells.

13:49.673 --> 13:52.278
Margaret would have my guts for
garters if he'd been shipped.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.271
Of course.

14:09.563 --> 14:10.909
It burns!

14:11.586 --> 14:14.626
It burns! Please, please help.

14:15.385 --> 14:17.750
Nurse Sullivan, may I be of assistance?

14:20.012 --> 14:22.392
I've been instructed not to treat him.

14:22.591 --> 14:24.654
What? Instructed by whom?

14:25.929 --> 14:27.156
From the government.

14:27.281 --> 14:29.658
Something about the
new immigration laws.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.483
My leg. Please.

14:32.332 --> 14:34.141
I'm Dr. Julia Ogden.

14:34.209 --> 14:35.552
What is your name?

14:35.775 --> 14:36.978
Jakub.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.723
Jakub Czarnecki.

14:38.848 --> 14:41.069
- Please...
- Just one moment.

14:42.819 --> 14:44.667
These are the early stages of gangrene.

14:44.691 --> 14:46.460
They won't let him be admitted.

14:52.134 --> 14:54.592
Dr. Forbes, why are we
not helping this man?

14:54.648 --> 14:56.547
He's scheduled to be deported.

14:56.555 --> 14:57.782
Have you examined him?

14:57.810 --> 15:00.436
- His leg may need to be amputated.
- If he were a patient,

15:00.456 --> 15:03.201
we might be able to do
something. But all we can do

15:03.285 --> 15:05.708
is keep him comfortable
until they come for him.

15:06.274 --> 15:08.020
Has he committed a crime?

15:08.111 --> 15:12.123
Apparently his wound qualifies
him as a burden on the country,

15:12.748 --> 15:16.051
which is enough to deport
him. That's all I've been told.

15:22.613 --> 15:25.669
- It had to have been a crime of opportunity.
- Why?

15:25.860 --> 15:27.474
The idea that killing McBride

15:27.490 --> 15:29.885
would stop the
deportations makes no sense.

15:30.136 --> 15:32.530
The law is the law,
if he's alive or dead.

15:32.905 --> 15:34.239
So it was done in a rage.

15:34.570 --> 15:36.000
That's the clearest line.

15:36.447 --> 15:38.184
Though Palmer's alibi

15:38.236 --> 15:39.671
is he doesn't have an alibi.

15:40.543 --> 15:41.815
I tell you something, Murdoch,

15:42.129 --> 15:43.970
I don't much care for oily fish,

15:44.014 --> 15:46.161
but this strained yogurt... excellent.

15:46.177 --> 15:47.472
Sirs.

15:47.597 --> 15:49.923
- I think we're onto something.
- Go on.

15:49.970 --> 15:53.213
Well, after Mr. McBride
left the Greek section,

15:53.228 --> 15:55.338
he went to the hospital,
where he and another man

15:55.344 --> 15:57.168
were involved in a physical altercation.

15:57.181 --> 16:00.579
The man's father is a patient,
and also on the deportation list.

16:00.617 --> 16:03.437
- Threats were made.
- Do you have this man's name?

16:03.462 --> 16:07.932
I do. I assume he's Greek,
sir. It's Athos Rella.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.078
Perhaps there's more than one?

16:18.255 --> 16:21.050
- I don't believe this.
- Sir.

16:21.629 --> 16:24.306
This is what you get when
you help someone, Murdoch.

16:24.431 --> 16:26.809
My mother always said I was
too much of a soft touch.

16:26.827 --> 16:30.469
Sir, we don't yet know where Athos
was at the time of the murder.

16:30.507 --> 16:33.426
I let the man out of jail,
and he bloody kills someone.

16:33.551 --> 16:35.847
What were you thinking,
ya big Yorkshire pillock.

16:35.866 --> 16:37.896
Sir, I'm having him brought in now.

16:39.141 --> 16:41.332
We need to resolve this quickly.

16:41.388 --> 16:44.557
My neck could be on the chopping
block if this ever gets out.

16:45.877 --> 16:48.224
Never. I could never do that.

16:48.261 --> 16:51.181
You were seen fighting at the hospital
shortly before he was murdered.

16:51.224 --> 16:52.389
It wasn't me.

16:52.394 --> 16:55.188
I was at the hospital visiting
my father. He is very ill.

16:55.208 --> 16:58.157
- And did you assault James McBride?
- No.

16:58.177 --> 16:59.979
That's enough, Athos. The truth.

17:00.313 --> 17:01.966
Just tell us what happened.

17:02.161 --> 17:03.820
Maybe we can help you.

17:05.741 --> 17:07.300
I saw him.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.923
There you are.

17:09.217 --> 17:11.189
- Go on.
- But there was no fight.

17:11.209 --> 17:13.720
There was no altercation of any kind?

17:14.819 --> 17:17.002
Look, I once put the boots to a man

17:17.007 --> 17:19.752
who threatened to take my father
away. Nobody can blame you for that.

17:20.011 --> 17:22.815
- Just tell us.
- I have told you.

17:22.825 --> 17:25.405
- You fought with him and then you killed him.
- No!

17:26.391 --> 17:27.685
Right.

17:27.741 --> 17:29.833
Where did you go after the hospital?

17:29.853 --> 17:31.830
Home. To my wife.

17:31.875 --> 17:34.405
- And she can attest to this?
- Yes, she can.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.492
Of course your wife would lie for you.

17:36.746 --> 17:39.171
I could arrest you
both, have you deported.

17:39.196 --> 17:41.209
- Shall we try that?
- Wait, please...

17:41.248 --> 17:44.446
- What's that?
- Nothing, I was working... ah!

17:44.764 --> 17:46.518
Looks like you've been in a fight.

17:49.771 --> 17:51.658
What would you recommend as a post-op?

17:51.678 --> 17:53.401
Medication has been delayed...

17:53.750 --> 17:57.534
- Dr. Ogden?
- I was hoping to discuss Jakub Czarnecki.

17:57.559 --> 17:59.920
- Hasn't he been sent back?
- Not yet.

17:59.965 --> 18:02.041
I'm afraid there's
nothing more we can do.

18:02.241 --> 18:05.234
We were given a direct order
from a government agency.

18:05.304 --> 18:07.097
His leg is gangrenous.

18:07.112 --> 18:09.787
- His life is in danger.
- They have hospitals in Poland.

18:09.912 --> 18:13.043
He could die in transport,
if he even makes it that far!

18:13.068 --> 18:15.479
If you think I'm pleased
about this, Dr. Ogden,

18:15.499 --> 18:17.834
let me disabuse you of that notion.

18:18.178 --> 18:20.887
But we are required to follow the law.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.626
Now, that's an end to it.

18:22.914 --> 18:24.663
Now please.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.267
You should run for office.

18:28.293 --> 18:30.674
Your skills are obviously
being wasted here.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.630
Everything all right?

18:55.308 --> 18:56.918
What sort of country are we becoming

18:56.933 --> 18:59.313
that we just throw away people
who are different from us?

18:59.901 --> 19:02.417
The man, Frank Oliver,
who designed the law,

19:02.436 --> 19:05.210
is not the most enlightened of thinkers.

19:05.335 --> 19:07.253
And now this Polish man may die

19:07.278 --> 19:09.071
simply because he wasn't born here.

19:09.738 --> 19:11.356
There's nothing you can do?

19:12.601 --> 19:16.262
Dr. Forbes has specifically
instructed me not to treat him.

19:16.561 --> 19:19.320
"We are required to follow the law".

19:19.614 --> 19:20.983
I understand.

19:21.003 --> 19:24.619
But there's nothing
you can do beyond that?

19:26.701 --> 19:29.520
Are you advising me
to disobey my superior?

19:30.785 --> 19:34.456
As a police officer, I
would never advise that,

19:35.580 --> 19:38.839
but a man may die.

19:41.593 --> 19:43.976
You do have a rebellious spirit

19:44.011 --> 19:45.836
buried in there, don't you?

20:06.700 --> 20:09.424
- Oh. Doctor.
- How are you feeling?

20:11.666 --> 20:13.707
Not as well as I should

20:14.305 --> 20:17.189
with two beautiful women in the room.

20:17.538 --> 20:18.957
Nurse?

20:19.152 --> 20:20.516
In Poland,

20:20.641 --> 20:24.098
I was the best Polonez
dancer in Malbork, you know.

20:25.084 --> 20:27.341
Perhaps when this is over,

20:27.945 --> 20:29.996
you will let me show you.

20:31.007 --> 20:33.377
Excuse us for a moment.

20:39.792 --> 20:41.550
What is he doing here?

20:41.809 --> 20:43.662
I'm going to operate.

20:43.787 --> 20:45.340
I'll need your help.

20:45.948 --> 20:48.847
We could be permanently stricken
from the register if we get caught.

20:48.866 --> 20:51.492
And if we do nothing, he may die.

20:52.577 --> 20:54.031
If it comes to it,

20:54.490 --> 20:56.826
I'll say I ordered you to assist me.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.370
- Everything all right, George?
- Sir.

21:11.385 --> 21:13.575
The latest edition of the
Telegraph just came out.

21:13.700 --> 21:16.554
- Louise Cherry's published a new article.
- Oh.

21:17.301 --> 21:18.606
Oh...

21:18.731 --> 21:21.026
She knows the Inspector
let that chap out of jail.

21:21.345 --> 21:24.258
"The Inspector has
blood on his hands... "

21:24.532 --> 21:29.110
"A Greek intruder cut down one
of the King's noble subjects... "

21:29.683 --> 21:32.031
"Inspector Bumblereid?"

21:32.952 --> 21:34.907
Murdoch!

21:39.689 --> 21:41.809
I just spoke to the Board of Control.

21:41.869 --> 21:45.017
They made it very clear that I
need to fix my mistake immediately.

21:45.037 --> 21:48.045
- We're doing all we can, sir.
- Not quickly enough.

21:48.170 --> 21:50.590
I want this case closed.
I want Athos charged.

21:50.715 --> 21:53.748
- But we don't have evidence yet.
- He attacked McBride,

21:53.788 --> 21:56.692
- he had motivation... it's got to be him.
- Sir...

21:57.907 --> 21:59.850
My job's at stake here, Murdoch.

21:59.890 --> 22:03.017
If you can't get a confession, I will.

22:10.807 --> 22:12.167
Sit.

22:13.726 --> 22:15.449
Have you spoken to my wife?

22:17.894 --> 22:21.211
Trust me when I tell you I've heard
enough lies to last me a lifetime.

22:21.710 --> 22:24.584
I said sit.

22:32.860 --> 22:34.509
What do you want from me?

22:35.002 --> 22:36.426
Say it.

22:36.720 --> 22:37.720
No.

22:38.114 --> 22:40.595
- You killed him.
- I did not.

22:41.103 --> 22:42.344
You fought with him at the hospital,

22:42.368 --> 22:44.784
- you followed him, and you killed him.
- Why would I?

22:44.812 --> 22:46.741
You let me leave. I was free.

22:46.771 --> 22:49.481
I would not risk going back to
Greece and leaving my family.

22:49.506 --> 22:51.640
You found out that McBride
was going to deport your father

22:51.652 --> 22:53.880
and you attacked him. Blind rage.

22:53.896 --> 22:55.510
My father will die soon.

22:55.635 --> 22:57.518
I want to be with him when it happens.

22:57.522 --> 23:01.218
In anger, in fear, I hit that
man, and I will always regret it.

23:01.242 --> 23:02.963
But that was the end of it.

23:03.788 --> 23:05.612
The fact is, Athos,

23:06.059 --> 23:07.617
I simply don't believe you.

23:08.247 --> 23:10.008
You talk about family.

23:10.371 --> 23:12.422
Because of what you've
done, I could lose my job.

23:12.816 --> 23:15.769
That puts my people, my family, at risk.

23:15.993 --> 23:18.313
And you don't want to know how
far I'll go to protect them.

23:18.738 --> 23:21.257
So you would have me
lie to save yourself?

23:22.116 --> 23:24.940
You remind me of the
Elliniki Astinomia in Greece.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.629
They are not police. They are thugs.

23:26.653 --> 23:28.056
What did you just call me?

23:28.107 --> 23:29.594
You killed an innocent man.

23:29.610 --> 23:31.494
You followed him, and
you bashed his head in.

23:31.506 --> 23:33.757
- Admit it.
- No!

23:36.932 --> 23:39.323
Confess to the killing of James McBride.

23:39.861 --> 23:42.064
Is this why you became a police officer?

23:42.100 --> 23:44.331
To put innocent people in jail?

23:47.758 --> 23:49.280
Give me the confession.

23:49.534 --> 23:52.407
I will sign whatever
you want. Just please...

23:52.532 --> 23:54.148
keep my family safe.

24:01.336 --> 24:02.723
It wasn't him.

24:03.221 --> 24:06.424
- Sir?
- Trust me. We need to look elsewhere.

24:06.966 --> 24:09.194
Damn that Louise Cherry for
putting us in this position.

24:09.258 --> 24:11.290
Yes. I've been thinking, sir...

24:11.760 --> 24:14.534
the wording she uses is
particularly schismatic.

24:14.542 --> 24:16.761
Almost as though she
were furthering an agenda.

24:16.785 --> 24:18.498
She's a bloody opportunist, Murdoch.

24:19.107 --> 24:22.262
Thought you might like to
know, rioting in Greektown.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.417
Apparently there are injuries.

24:41.255 --> 24:43.813
- Detective...
- I'll call for an ambulance.

24:51.655 --> 24:52.838
Murdoch.

24:53.332 --> 24:54.440
Look at that.

24:54.565 --> 24:56.038
_

24:56.069 --> 24:57.811
We need to contain this.

24:58.165 --> 25:01.509
Bring in Louise Cherry before she
adds more fuel to the bloody fire.

25:01.515 --> 25:02.621
Sir.

25:10.252 --> 25:11.435
Gentlemen.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.264
I've been summoned.

25:13.591 --> 25:14.926
Again.

25:15.587 --> 25:17.620
We have some questions, Miss Cherry.

25:17.711 --> 25:20.144
A few comments, as well. Have a seat.

25:22.709 --> 25:24.472
May I take notes?

25:24.534 --> 25:26.091
For what purpose?

25:26.953 --> 25:28.327
I am a journalist.

25:28.367 --> 25:31.261
This is part of an ongoing
police investigation, so no,

25:31.320 --> 25:32.690
you may not.

25:34.323 --> 25:37.512
- How may I help?
- You can start by issuing an apology.

25:37.517 --> 25:39.477
Was there something
inaccurate about my reporting?

25:39.888 --> 25:41.746
"Inspector Bumblereid?"

25:42.030 --> 25:43.728
I'd say that's pretty bloody inaccurate,

25:43.748 --> 25:46.637
as well as being a
personal attack. Slanderous.

25:46.876 --> 25:49.018
Your decision cost a man his life.

25:49.197 --> 25:52.932
- Athos Rella did not kill James McBride.
- No? Who did?

25:55.766 --> 25:58.993
Where did you get the information
to write your story, Miss Cherry?

26:00.801 --> 26:03.785
I have no intention of
revealing my sources.

26:03.910 --> 26:06.355
We've been down this road
before, if I'm not mistaken.

26:06.380 --> 26:09.577
This journalism, as you
call it, is inflammatory,

26:09.702 --> 26:12.112
and could be seen as a
call to incite violence.

26:12.142 --> 26:14.299
Which is precisely what
happened this afternoon.

26:14.574 --> 26:17.308
I was reporting the truth, Inspector.

26:17.626 --> 26:19.932
Perhaps if you hadn't
let an unhinged man

26:19.946 --> 26:22.093
out of jail because he
built your kitchen cabinets,

26:22.123 --> 26:23.791
we wouldn't be in this situation.

26:24.036 --> 26:26.348
- Who put you up to it?
- I beg your pardon?

26:26.352 --> 26:29.380
Did someone influence your
decision to write this article?

26:29.417 --> 26:32.211
Because the wording seems very divisive.

26:32.274 --> 26:35.383
Detective, the citizens of
Toronto, and this country,

26:35.465 --> 26:37.861
are being overrun by foreigners.

26:37.986 --> 26:41.363
They're changing the very fabric
of our society as we speak.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.689
Do you know how many
Greek men in this city

26:43.703 --> 26:46.234
- have been charged with a crime?
- I can't say I know or care.

26:46.259 --> 26:47.664
One in three.

26:47.718 --> 26:49.292
Don't you find that disturbing?

26:49.904 --> 26:52.026
Sounds like fabricated news to me.

26:52.967 --> 26:54.964
Well, you'll just have
to read my next article.

26:54.984 --> 26:56.609
I do go into some detail.

26:57.022 --> 26:58.706
Is there anything else?

27:00.986 --> 27:03.059
- You're free to go.
- Good.

27:04.065 --> 27:05.953
But I will remind you, Miss Cherry,

27:05.973 --> 27:08.821
to be careful what you choose
to write about in the future.

27:09.548 --> 27:11.740
If you remember what
happened the last time

27:11.760 --> 27:13.807
you were caught printing falsehoods.

27:14.624 --> 27:18.108
As I recall, I was given a
better job and my own byline.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.873
Just give me the tiniest reason

27:21.888 --> 27:24.035
to throw her back in jail,
Murdoch. I'm begging you.

27:24.050 --> 27:27.169
I'm certain that reason
will present itself, sir.

27:32.584 --> 27:35.287
Everything's going to
be fine, Mr. Czarnecki.

27:36.024 --> 27:38.509
I should have been
more careful that day.

27:38.862 --> 27:42.095
If only I had heard my friends
calling for me to move...

27:42.124 --> 27:43.589
It's not your fault.

27:43.714 --> 27:45.963
Injuries and accidents happen.

27:45.965 --> 27:49.402
Luckily, medicine will ensure
you don't need to lose your life.

27:49.925 --> 27:53.411
Yes, yes, of course. I just...

27:54.606 --> 27:56.405
I am afraid.

27:56.424 --> 27:58.964
Dr. Ogden will take
very good care of you.

27:59.026 --> 28:01.130
The pain will soon be gone.

28:02.213 --> 28:03.913
Thank you.

28:03.969 --> 28:05.638
Thank you both.

28:06.260 --> 28:07.941
Are we ready?

28:13.450 --> 28:15.231
Let's begin.

28:25.235 --> 28:28.143
- What on earth are you two doing?
- Dr. Dixon,

28:28.268 --> 28:30.396
- I can explain...
- Ha!

28:31.031 --> 28:32.888
This is grounds for dismissal.

28:33.551 --> 28:37.111
You were explicitly instructed
not to treat this man.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.417
I'm especially surprised
at you, Nurse Sullivan.

28:39.477 --> 28:42.619
- She's not at fault. I gave her no choice.
- That is irrelevant.

28:43.233 --> 28:45.863
I'll be reporting this
to Dr. Forbes immediately.

28:45.888 --> 28:47.791
Please. Wait.

28:48.577 --> 28:50.464
We're trying to save this man's life.

28:50.494 --> 28:51.893
He could die an agonizing death.

28:51.903 --> 28:54.697
This hospital is not a vehicle for
your personal crusades, Dr. Ogden.

28:54.717 --> 28:56.435
Now, I understand
because of your gender,

28:56.445 --> 28:58.766
- your emotions may have clouded your judgment...
- This has nothing to do

28:58.778 --> 29:00.622
with my emotions, or my gender.

29:02.666 --> 29:03.961
I took a vow...

29:04.086 --> 29:08.440
- we took a vow...
- This man is not our responsibility.

29:08.469 --> 29:10.501
Everyone who requires medical attention

29:10.511 --> 29:12.418
is our responsibility, Dr. Dixon.

29:12.613 --> 29:14.863
I became a surgeon to save lives.

29:14.873 --> 29:16.473
Why did you?

29:18.430 --> 29:20.079
Help us.

29:23.893 --> 29:26.408
- You must be joking.
- Not at all.

29:27.026 --> 29:29.377
You're one of the most
capable surgeons in our class.

29:29.387 --> 29:31.136
Yes, and I would like to stay one.

29:31.703 --> 29:35.154
You don't think a human life
is more important than the law?

29:44.989 --> 29:46.364
Oh, George.

29:46.942 --> 29:48.376
Sir?

29:49.555 --> 29:51.335
I found it highly irregular

29:51.370 --> 29:53.791
that the majority of the men
being deported were Greek,

29:53.826 --> 29:57.327
and even stranger that most of
them worked for Andrew Palmer.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.721
Look at this.

29:58.890 --> 30:02.542
All of these arrests were
made during a two-week period,

30:02.598 --> 30:06.103
just prior to the Immigration
Act coming into effect.

30:06.122 --> 30:07.828
I see.

30:09.054 --> 30:12.080
Actually, I don't really
see, sir. What does that mean?

30:12.292 --> 30:14.843
Well... I'm not certain, but

30:15.022 --> 30:17.697
the charges were almost
exclusively misdemeanors.

30:17.707 --> 30:21.467
That, coupled with the strange
timeline, could mean something.

30:21.592 --> 30:23.325
So what do we do next?

30:24.794 --> 30:26.946
One woman in particular,

30:26.966 --> 30:28.808
an Anne McKinnon,

30:28.848 --> 30:31.946
was involved in five
separate solicitation cases,

30:31.971 --> 30:33.704
all within a two-day period.

30:33.749 --> 30:36.493
Well, perhaps she was just
popular with the lads, sir.

30:36.508 --> 30:38.724
Yes, but she was never
charged or arrested.

30:39.048 --> 30:40.911
Yet all of the men were.

30:42.316 --> 30:44.368
- Hm.
- Hm!

30:47.461 --> 30:49.388
Anne McKinnon?

30:51.894 --> 30:53.717
Toronto Constabulary.

30:53.842 --> 30:55.838
What is it? I've got
things that need doing.

30:55.963 --> 30:59.848
You were recently involved in
several arrests involving Greek men.

30:59.913 --> 31:02.572
I don't ask where they come
from, so I couldn't tell you.

31:02.592 --> 31:04.932
The Greek accent usually
gives it away, Miss McKinnon.

31:05.057 --> 31:07.239
Five arrests in two days.

31:07.254 --> 31:08.813
You were named in each of the cases,

31:08.833 --> 31:10.915
and yet you were never
arrested or charged.

31:10.925 --> 31:12.833
Coppers love me. What can I say?

31:12.908 --> 31:14.377
I'm a delight.

31:14.751 --> 31:19.159
- How do you meet the men that solicit your services?
- They usually find me.

31:19.657 --> 31:23.497
We have reason to believe that
these arrests are linked to a murder.

31:23.552 --> 31:26.142
James McBride. You may have
seen his name in the papers.

31:26.157 --> 31:27.856
I had nothing to do with it.

31:28.050 --> 31:30.211
What do you recall about these arrests?

31:30.236 --> 31:31.830
I was paid well.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.398
More than usual?

31:33.757 --> 31:35.176
By whom?

31:35.595 --> 31:37.747
Not the Greeks, I can tell you that.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.383
Miss McKinnon, unless you'd like
to see the inside of our cells,

31:41.403 --> 31:43.605
I suggest you stop playing games.

31:44.810 --> 31:47.097
He's a client. One of my best.

31:47.122 --> 31:50.444
He told me where to find the
men, and to just do what I do.

31:50.449 --> 31:53.403
Miss McKinnon, a name, please.

31:53.677 --> 31:55.465
Paul Scotch.

31:56.108 --> 31:58.753
- The union leader?
- One and the same.

31:59.017 --> 32:01.371
So Scotch and McBride
were working together?

32:01.415 --> 32:03.115
Not necessarily.

32:03.407 --> 32:06.794
If Scotch arranged for the
arrests because he knew the law

32:06.825 --> 32:09.988
was about to pass, that doesn't
necessarily mean that McBride knew.

32:10.231 --> 32:13.262
But if he found out after the fact,
and confronted Scotch about it...

32:13.287 --> 32:15.323
That could have given
Scotch a reason to kill him.

32:15.342 --> 32:18.118
It's also plausible that the
two men were working together,

32:18.149 --> 32:21.244
and Andrew Palmer found
out and killed McBride.

32:22.041 --> 32:25.604
Mr. Scotch? Toronto Constabulary.

32:26.631 --> 32:28.436
Mr. Scotch?

32:28.791 --> 32:31.188
Uh, sir.

32:51.115 --> 32:53.318
At least this absolves Athos.

32:53.368 --> 32:56.487
Well, sir, it may be more
prudent to wait to release him

32:56.518 --> 32:59.662
- until we've resolved this.
- What do you have?

32:59.706 --> 33:02.718
Well, sir, it's possible
that Scotch and McBride

33:02.743 --> 33:06.796
were working together to arrest
and deport all of Palmer's workers

33:06.826 --> 33:09.516
in order to force him
to hire union workers.

33:09.745 --> 33:11.862
So Palmer found out, and killed them.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.495
Potentially.

33:13.669 --> 33:16.369
I suggest we go and have a
little chat with Mr. Palmer.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.787
- Sir.
- Carry on, lads.

33:21.374 --> 33:24.427
I don't like the way
I'm being spoken to here.

33:24.845 --> 33:26.339
Where were you this morning?

33:26.364 --> 33:28.859
I was interviewing more
workers at my office.

33:28.879 --> 33:31.842
- Which, it turns out, was a waste of time.
- Why?

33:31.852 --> 33:33.959
The city withdrew the
contract a few hours ago.

33:33.984 --> 33:36.037
Too much bad publicity, they said.

33:36.764 --> 33:38.099
I'm done.

33:38.108 --> 33:40.385
Palmer Construction is sunk.

33:40.429 --> 33:42.760
Not to mention you're
also facing the noose.

33:42.795 --> 33:44.553
Bit of a bad day all around.

33:44.748 --> 33:48.310
You won that contract by
hiring non-union workers,

33:48.348 --> 33:50.012
which angered Mr. Scotch.

33:50.032 --> 33:53.165
So McBride and Scotch had your
workers arrested and deported,

33:53.189 --> 33:55.296
thinking it would force
you to hire union men.

33:55.679 --> 33:57.886
How did you find out about their plan?

33:57.925 --> 33:59.644
I didn't know anything about it!

33:59.833 --> 34:03.219
In fact, if you want the truth,
I doubt they ever had one.

34:03.294 --> 34:06.098
- How do you mean?
- McBride would never break the law.

34:06.143 --> 34:08.409
The man was a do-gooder,
through and through.

34:09.425 --> 34:12.742
I tried paying him off myself
on more than one occasion.

34:12.867 --> 34:14.842
You attempted to bribe him?

34:15.092 --> 34:19.989
He was trying to deport my entire
work force. Of course I tried.

34:20.034 --> 34:22.475
- But he wouldn't take it?
- Not a penny.

34:22.708 --> 34:24.018
Look,

34:24.072 --> 34:27.121
I spent years trying to
get a contract like this,

34:27.202 --> 34:30.911
but I failed every single time
because of men like Copley and Scotch.

34:30.917 --> 34:34.717
Now that I finally got one,
there's no way I'd risk losing it.

34:34.985 --> 34:37.929
I'm telling you, I
didn't kill those men.

34:41.446 --> 34:45.344
The infection's begun spreading,
but I believe we can contain it.

34:50.270 --> 34:51.900
Wait.

34:52.697 --> 34:54.882
Have you considered Bromide?

34:55.940 --> 34:59.354
- The infection's moving too quickly.
- I don't believe so.

34:59.356 --> 35:02.068
I recently came across an
older case study by Goldsmith...

35:02.071 --> 35:03.939
he was able to stifle
the poisoned section

35:03.964 --> 35:06.997
using a combination of an
injected and a topical solution.

35:07.809 --> 35:09.756
The risk is too high.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.162
If you're wrong, the infection
will continue to spread,

35:12.187 --> 35:15.270
- and he'll be on a ship back to Poland.
- Yes, but if I'm right,

35:15.706 --> 35:17.790
we'll be able to save this man's leg

35:17.915 --> 35:19.657
and keep him in the country.

35:20.648 --> 35:22.520
That's what you want, isn't it?

35:23.666 --> 35:26.595
Perhaps we should re-examine
Mr. McBride's list.

35:26.620 --> 35:29.558
There may have been arrests for
violent crimes that we've missed.

35:29.578 --> 35:32.586
I'll be getting another call from
the Board of Control, I just know it.

35:32.646 --> 35:34.956
- George?
- Where are you lot headed?

35:35.081 --> 35:37.307
Sir, we're going down to
the Frank Oliver speech.

35:37.317 --> 35:39.712
There is concern of a
possibility of violence,

35:39.732 --> 35:42.172
given everything that's happened
over the last couple of days.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.413
All right, lads, let's move out.

35:44.737 --> 35:48.109
- You up for a bit of violence, Murdoch?
- Not particularly, sir.

35:48.163 --> 35:50.444
Nice change of pace if you ask me.

35:50.613 --> 35:52.172
Get your hat.

35:53.707 --> 35:58.493
This new Act will ensure
Canada remains a country

35:58.498 --> 36:01.687
for Canadians!

36:04.709 --> 36:06.951
Canada is a country

36:06.986 --> 36:09.366
made up of the King's loyal subjects,

36:09.376 --> 36:12.384
and that is the way it will remain

36:12.429 --> 36:16.448
for as long as I am alive. Thank you!

36:16.466 --> 36:19.223
Thank you!

36:20.020 --> 36:22.345
And now, Harold Copley,

36:22.365 --> 36:25.235
one of the great visionary
builders of this city.

36:25.294 --> 36:26.649
Traitor!

36:26.679 --> 36:29.529
- Turncoat!
- Thank you, Minister.

36:29.838 --> 36:32.414
This is, of course, a sad day.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.612
I recently learned of the murder
of my old friend, Paul Scotch.

36:36.737 --> 36:40.999
This act was no doubt perpetrated
by a cowardly immigrant.

36:41.258 --> 36:44.172
These people are not like us,

36:44.217 --> 36:46.289
they don't have bloody morals.

36:46.498 --> 36:48.196
They are animals.

36:48.878 --> 36:52.559
- Turncoat!
- But Copley... Copley Construction

36:52.684 --> 36:55.921
will strive to keep our country pure

36:55.951 --> 36:59.547
and consistent with our one true God.

36:59.786 --> 37:02.655
Thank you, and God Bless the King.

37:12.312 --> 37:14.638
Well, this is unusual.

37:14.807 --> 37:17.537
They're mostly union men. Why
are they so angry with Copley?

37:20.091 --> 37:22.676
Let me go!

37:22.716 --> 37:23.847
Crabtree, bring him here!

37:23.857 --> 37:26.163
What's all this about? Thought
Copley was your employer.

37:26.183 --> 37:27.707
Bastard sold us out.

37:27.752 --> 37:30.676
Tried to pay us non-union
wages for the Malvern job!

37:30.681 --> 37:32.289
Get him out of here, Crabtree.

37:37.026 --> 37:38.834
Interesting.

37:45.122 --> 37:48.316
- Mr. Copley. A word.
- Gentlemen.

37:48.441 --> 37:50.323
Did you catch the killer?

37:50.387 --> 37:53.874
- We're so close I can almost feel it.
- Ah.

37:53.889 --> 37:55.916
You were the next contractor in line

37:55.941 --> 37:58.760
to be awarded the Malvern
contract, were you not?

37:58.810 --> 38:02.032
A fortunate turn due to
unfortunate events, I suppose.

38:02.072 --> 38:04.980
What a horrible debacle
this all has been.

38:05.015 --> 38:07.844
Debacle indeed... almost caused a riot.

38:08.144 --> 38:10.116
It's quite serendipitous,
though, isn't it?

38:10.141 --> 38:11.898
Almost unbelievably so.

38:11.953 --> 38:14.642
- What are you insinuating?
- Bear with me for a moment.

38:14.767 --> 38:16.425
I have a brief tale to relate.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.432
I don't have time for this.

38:18.476 --> 38:21.395
There was a construction
tycoon who built half this city,

38:21.410 --> 38:23.382
as he was so quick to point out.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.649
He was used to getting
everything he wanted

38:25.774 --> 38:28.463
and no one dared challenge
him for fear of reprisal.

38:28.493 --> 38:30.564
- Absurd.
- But that all changed

38:30.594 --> 38:33.498
when a large project, one of the
biggest in the city's history,

38:33.623 --> 38:38.463
was awarded to a man that the
construction tycoon deemed inferior.

38:39.021 --> 38:41.636
Of course, this infuriated the tycoon,

38:41.761 --> 38:43.399
so he and his union man

38:43.414 --> 38:45.939
devised a plan to sabotage the project.

38:46.348 --> 38:50.103
They saw the Immigration Act as an
opportunity rather than a hindrance.

38:50.660 --> 38:53.166
This is libelous, sir.

38:53.544 --> 38:56.787
Only, the man who was enforcing
the law found out about the scheme.

38:56.797 --> 38:58.366
Your implication being?

38:58.380 --> 39:01.035
McBride figured out what you
were doing, and you killed him.

39:01.105 --> 39:04.974
And Mr. Scotch learned that you were
planning to use non-union labour.

39:04.979 --> 39:06.598
He threatened to expose you,

39:06.723 --> 39:09.282
so you strangled him and buried him.

39:11.866 --> 39:14.083
This is absolutely witless.

39:14.869 --> 39:18.386
I fear for this great
city if minds like yours

39:18.405 --> 39:20.901
are tasked with protecting its citizens.

39:20.946 --> 39:23.332
- You killed those men.
- Got any proof?

39:24.288 --> 39:25.816
Any evidence?

39:25.941 --> 39:29.224
Anything other than your asinine theory?

39:30.089 --> 39:33.426
Dammit, Eliza, how many
times must I tell you...

39:33.446 --> 39:36.484
- I'm sorry...
- You're fired, you bloody idiot!

39:36.509 --> 39:38.088
Get the hell out of here!

39:42.615 --> 39:45.574
And that goes for you as well.

39:46.142 --> 39:50.963
And rest assured I will do all in
my power to have both your jobs.

39:51.800 --> 39:54.718
- Your rug.
- What? What about it?

39:55.116 --> 39:59.365
This rug seems to have
replaced a much older one.

39:59.409 --> 40:02.334
Oh, for God's sake. What
are you on about now?

40:02.350 --> 40:04.537
Mr. McBride was found rolled up in a rug

40:04.552 --> 40:07.386
and I would wager that
it was exactly the size

40:07.397 --> 40:09.448
of the one that you recently replaced.

40:09.518 --> 40:11.062
You killed him here.

40:11.321 --> 40:12.949
You tried to dispose of the body,

40:12.964 --> 40:15.295
ran into the night watchman,
and had to abandon it.

40:15.534 --> 40:17.303
You call that evidence?

40:17.831 --> 40:21.043
I'm calling the Chief
Constable personally.

40:21.272 --> 40:25.463
I built MacMillan tower and
I will ruin the both of you.

40:27.661 --> 40:31.459
Should I put this back on the
shelf before I go, Mr. Copley?

40:31.677 --> 40:34.703
It was in a closet under a blanket.

40:35.195 --> 40:37.268
Very messy.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.649
Care to revise your story?

40:58.453 --> 41:00.233
Gentlemen,

41:00.358 --> 41:03.041
this is the man who tried to
have you sent back to Greece.

41:03.166 --> 41:04.834
Constable.

41:05.183 --> 41:07.038
Enjoy getting acquainted.

41:10.269 --> 41:12.946
What are you looking
at, you filthy mugs?

41:13.756 --> 41:15.860
You keep your bloody hands off of me.

41:15.885 --> 41:18.917
Keep your bloody hands off of me!

41:28.288 --> 41:30.697
Thank you for finding the truth.

41:33.138 --> 41:34.943
Athos, I...

41:35.348 --> 41:38.125
Yes. Go on.

41:40.782 --> 41:41.879
I would be honoured

41:41.894 --> 41:44.006
if you'd come over for
dinner tonight with your wife.

41:47.447 --> 41:49.978
- On one condition.
- Name it.

41:51.362 --> 41:53.369
We drink Greek wine.

41:54.564 --> 41:56.552
I won't fight you on that.

41:58.414 --> 42:01.891
The men in the cells... what
will happen to them? To us?

42:02.135 --> 42:05.626
The Minister of the Interior has
decided to delay the deportations.

42:05.835 --> 42:08.116
They'll all be released
until this is resolved.

42:08.241 --> 42:09.695
And then?

42:10.137 --> 42:11.737
I'm afraid I don't know.

42:12.239 --> 42:13.784
Mr. Rella,

42:13.909 --> 42:18.691
the law isn't always an
accurate measure of a society.

42:20.823 --> 42:22.839
Then what is?

42:25.267 --> 42:27.173
You saved me, Doctor.

42:27.189 --> 42:30.886
I wish I could repay you somehow.

42:30.925 --> 42:33.376
Perhaps, when you're fully recovered,

42:33.402 --> 42:35.755
my husband and I will
join you and Nurse Sullivan

42:35.767 --> 42:40.272
- for a night of dancing.
- Oh, I would like that very much.

42:40.303 --> 42:42.102
Your husband

42:42.139 --> 42:44.431
is a very fortunate man.

42:45.159 --> 42:47.475
Do widzenia, my dear.

42:48.534 --> 42:52.008
- Goodbye, my lovely.
- Goodbye.

43:03.101 --> 43:05.990
He'll live to dance
another day, won't he?

43:06.015 --> 43:08.324
Sooner than he should, I'm sure.

43:08.984 --> 43:11.923
Thank you for helping him. And me.

43:11.960 --> 43:13.884
There's no need for that, Julia.

43:14.575 --> 43:17.002
You simply reminded
me of what my job is.

43:18.590 --> 43:20.234
It's well done.
