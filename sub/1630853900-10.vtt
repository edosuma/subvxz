WEBVTT

00:27.695 --> 00:29.130
<i>Previously on</i> Raising Kanan...

00:29.263 --> 00:30.231
Give me what you got, nigga.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.799
You ain't gonna do shit, Famous.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.137
<i>This right here is Zisa,</i>

00:36.270 --> 00:38.072
<i>and the track's called
"Bruise."</i>

00:39.640 --> 00:41.375
I can't have Raq touching
this label.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.545
Assuming Crown Camacho's
dancing days are over,

00:44.645 --> 00:45.813
<i>I want half of his half.</i>

00:46.147 --> 00:47.181
Cartier ain't the type to just

00:47.314 --> 00:48.516
<i>let people walk away from him.</i>

00:48.649 --> 00:50.084
<i>You and me reach an agreement,</i>

00:50.217 --> 00:51.819
I'll handle Cartier.

00:53.587 --> 00:54.655
So when you gonna
give me those digits?

00:54.755 --> 00:56.724
- We not like that.
- Well, not yet we not.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.359
<i>Don't you see
I'm trying to save you?</i>

00:58.492 --> 01:02.129
Fucked up shit happen
to fucked up people,

01:02.263 --> 01:03.330
and I'm fucked up.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.432
So I'm sorry.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.066
I'ma try to do good now.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.201
We said no more secrets, Kanan.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.369
We did.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.370
There something you
wanna say to me,

01:09.503 --> 01:10.371
you should probably say it.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.173
I know you my father, man.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.140
And I been knowin'.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.341
If I do this,

01:14.475 --> 01:15.342
it's outside my family.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.844
Aah!

01:18.546 --> 01:20.281
Oh, fuck.

01:20.381 --> 01:23.184
His name was Marco Boselli,

01:23.317 --> 01:24.552
<i>Sal's son.</i>

01:24.685 --> 01:26.220
We found the person
who was with Marco.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.421
It's Dominic.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.126
I'm a big believer
in balance and karma, Raq.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.595
So I'm telling you,
your brother has to go.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.464
Hey, Marvin.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.631
Yo.

01:40.734 --> 01:41.836
I think that Howard
and Raquel Thomas

01:42.169 --> 01:43.103
<i>slept together
when she was underage,</i>

01:43.237 --> 01:44.738
<i>and Kanan Stark is his kid.</i>

01:44.872 --> 01:46.507
<i>The thing that I can't
figure out is how this all</i>

01:46.640 --> 01:47.875
<i>tracks back to the shooting.</i>

01:48.209 --> 01:49.777
Sam here says he's got an ID
on Howard's shooter.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.779
Yeah, we already been down
that road with you, Sam.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.782
I was fucked up that night,
but I remember now.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.718

Look what you made me do.

04:07.281 --> 04:08.749
Yo, Marv, man, I'm about
to get on that bus, man.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.017
I got my ticket

04:10.317 --> 04:11.452
and my motherfuckin' snacks
right here--

04:11.585 --> 04:13.320
I couldn't have been
any clearer, nigga.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.289
I said go,

04:15.422 --> 04:16.590
and don't never come back.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.359
Listen, I'm goin', Marv.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.861
For real, you ain't gonna
never see Sam never again.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.464
I'm just gonna be a rumor
on these fuckin' streets, man.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.299
I'll be a damn ghost out here.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.335
That bus done came and went, nigga.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.004
We've passed that.
Time to move on.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.877
Yo, let me get
this last hit then.

05:04.004 --> 05:07.675
You ain't know
I was an accountant.

05:07.808 --> 05:11.378
Downtown fuckin' with them
Price Waterhouse niggas.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.848
<i>I have my CPA and all that.</i>

05:14.982 --> 05:16.750
<i>Ain't that some shit?</i>

05:16.884 --> 05:19.520
<i>Motherfuckers trusted Sam
with they money.</i>

05:20.587 --> 05:23.357
Had me countin' that shit,

05:23.490 --> 05:26.460
addin' it up and all that.

05:26.593 --> 05:29.730
I even had my own motherfuckin'
cubicle out this bitch.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.604
Took one hit
of this crack rock, though,

05:37.738 --> 05:41.608
all that shit went up in smoke,

05:41.742 --> 05:44.111
and here the fuck we are.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.714
- And here we are.
- <i>Yo, Marv...</i>

05:48.615 --> 05:52.086
...sometimes in life,
you turn that corner,

05:52.419 --> 05:53.954
and you can't go back again.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.529
<i>Everybody talk
about them crossroads</i>

06:02.663 --> 06:05.099
<i>down south where you sell
your soul to the devil.</i>

06:05.432 --> 06:06.800
<i>Fuck that.</i>

06:06.934 --> 06:09.436
<i>I seen the devil posted up
on Guy Brewer,</i>

06:09.570 --> 06:10.771
<i>and that nigga ain't buyin'.</i>

06:10.871 --> 06:13.640
<i>He sellin'.</i>

06:13.774 --> 06:17.611
<i>You pay him that dime,
he take your soul,</i>

06:17.745 --> 06:19.980
<i>and he ain't givin'
the shit back.</i>

06:20.114 --> 06:22.883
<i>It's his and his for good.</i>

06:58.619 --> 07:00.454
You a wild girl, Raquel Thomas.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.423
I'm about my business, 'Nique.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.925
It's all these other niggas
out here wilin'.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.931
Sal Boselli is comin' for you.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.766
And I bet you told him
where to find me.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.901
Now, you know I ain't
the kind of nigga

07:14.034 --> 07:15.602
to go tellin'.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.937
It's not who I am.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.473
Sal's comin'.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.841
No doubt about it.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.810
There's gonna be some blood
in our streets.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.178
Our streets and their streets.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.513
I ain't never been afraid
of that.

07:26.647 --> 07:27.948
It is what it is.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.820
Look...

07:32.920 --> 07:35.622
soon as this Jersey shit
is over and done with,

07:35.756 --> 07:37.491
I'ma be worldwide.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.561
New markets, new opportunities,
new money.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.196
I could use heads
who know how this shit work.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.697
You want me to hustle for you?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.199
I mean, you already hustlin'
for me.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.134
I'm offerin' you
something bigger.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.103
This right here's
the ground floor,

07:50.204 --> 07:52.673
and we ain't goin'
nowhere but up.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.807
Know what?

07:53.941 --> 07:56.476
I'ma have to pass,
though, baby,

07:56.610 --> 07:57.878
respectfully and whatnot.

07:58.011 --> 08:01.248
You know, just I ain't built
to be nobody's employee.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.950
Know what I'm saying?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.785
Besides, me and Worrell,
we about to move on

08:04.918 --> 08:07.087
to greener pastures
and shit anyway,

08:07.221 --> 08:09.590
set up our own shingle,
so to speak.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.659
Shit, you know how we do.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.995
Well, as long as your business
don't bump into mine,

08:15.128 --> 08:19.066
'cause my elbows
is real sharp these days.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.971
You know, they broke the mold
when they made you, baby.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.245
You ever catch feelings
for me, Raq?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.983
This nigga talkin' crazy.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.687
They say most romances start
at the office,

08:40.821 --> 08:41.989
heads bumpin' into each other

08:42.122 --> 08:45.525
at the water cooler
and whatnot.

08:45.659 --> 08:49.129
I'm just wonderin'
if you ever favor me like that.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.904
We ain't got no water cooler,

08:57.037 --> 08:58.538
and the last time I checked,
you and me,

08:58.672 --> 09:00.641
we was tryin' to kill
each other for a hot second.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.242
Well, you know what they say.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.244
It's a thin line.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.248
Stay up, though, baby.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.917
Always.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.767
Yo, if you gonna
keep campin' out here,

09:26.867 --> 09:29.603
I'ma need you
to start kickin' in.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.306
I scraped together what I could
to last us, like, another week,

09:32.639 --> 09:35.309
but it's lookin' mad shaky
after that.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.311
Yeah, I hear you, brother.

09:37.644 --> 09:41.014
Thing is, my pockets
not exactly fat lately neither.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.126
Yo, what you think about
gettin' back on the corner?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.662
And sellin' what, nigga?

09:55.796 --> 09:56.930
That ass?

09:57.064 --> 09:59.199
I could get us work, Fame.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.134
Your ass gotta be down
for the crime.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.704
50-60 pieces like we had before

10:03.804 --> 10:06.206
ain't gonna pay
these bills, nigga.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.207
We need more than that.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.676
I got it.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.211
And Raq just gonna give you
that shit?

10:11.345 --> 10:14.147
I don't need her
to give me nothin'.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.649
That shit is mine.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.356
Shit been mine.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.141
What the fuck?

10:44.678 --> 10:46.980
Let me get in that booth.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.415
I thought we were taking
a couple weeks off

10:48.749 --> 10:49.883
'cause of Cartier.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.689
I only said that 'cause
my parents got all scared

10:55.822 --> 10:57.190
that him getting shot
had something to do

10:57.324 --> 10:58.725
with this music business.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.294
But I told them Cartier
made enemies everywhere,

11:01.428 --> 11:03.797
and nobody's getting murdered
because of a fuckin' song.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.237
I made a beat for myself.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.443
Check you out.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.416
I'm a artist, Lou,

11:22.749 --> 11:24.117
<i>a creator.</i>

11:37.264 --> 11:38.265
Word.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.905
You better recognize.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.307
Get in there.

12:08.962 --> 12:09.896
Let's do this.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.142
What's up, y'all?

12:22.275 --> 12:23.076
Yo, I gotta get these shoes
for work.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.244
I'ma hit you.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.830
So you thought you could just

12:43.964 --> 12:45.398
play me like that,
you snitch-ass motherfucker?

12:45.532 --> 12:47.100
You crazy fuckin' bitch!

12:47.234 --> 12:48.368
That date was a setup

12:48.502 --> 12:50.504
you, my moms,
and the church cooked up.

12:50.837 --> 12:52.873
Sister Kenya asked me to do it.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.908
Said she was worried about
the choices you was making.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.443
Wanted me to see
if you like niggas,

12:56.543 --> 12:58.845
and I told her
you just a dyke-ass bitch

12:58.945 --> 12:59.846
that's too ugly
to get with me anyway--

13:01.281 --> 13:02.415
Got a dyke-ass bitch
for you right here.

13:02.516 --> 13:03.517
Come on.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.159
Can I get with you now, nigga?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.393
Hmm?

13:15.996 --> 13:18.899
Bitch, can I get with you now?

13:18.999 --> 13:20.534
<i>Hey, enough!
Grab her!</i>

13:23.870 --> 13:25.305
We all good, man.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.840
Shit, we was just kickin' it.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.177
<i>Tell 'em, Corey,
that's just how we do.</i>

13:30.277 --> 13:32.212
We just friends, man.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.014
That's my guy.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.415
I was just showin' him
some love.

13:35.549 --> 13:36.917
She jumped me, man.

13:37.050 --> 13:37.918
That bitch sucker punched me
from behind.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.352
Pussy-ass nigga saw me coming

13:39.486 --> 13:42.222
and didn't do shit about it,
bitch-ass motherfucker.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.837
Shit.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.044
Aye, listen up.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.482
I'm looking for Sam.
Any of you seen him around?

14:12.953 --> 14:14.321
I'll get a wagon in here
and haul all you in.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.455
Anyone seen Sam?

14:15.589 --> 14:17.924
<i>Man, fuck Sam.</i>

14:18.058 --> 14:19.159
You seen him recently?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.295
Yeah, man.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.864
That nigga pockets
was all fat the other day.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.967
He ain't wanna share
none of that love with nobody,

14:27.067 --> 14:28.435
greedy-ass motherfucker.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.871
Where's Sam been smokin'?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.944
House at 107 and Inwood.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.546
They be actin' all saditty
over there and shit,

14:39.879 --> 14:41.615
'cause they spot got a heater.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.184
Gotta know you before they let
you in the door and shit.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.186
Man, fuck all them,

14:46.319 --> 14:48.288
and like I said, fuck Sam.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.390
You got an exact address?

14:52.192 --> 14:53.326
Yeah.

14:53.460 --> 14:57.964
1600 Smoke Spot Way, bitch.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.502
<i>Home of the fuckin'
Fiend family.</i>

15:02.636 --> 15:03.970
Motherfuckin' cop

15:04.104 --> 15:06.239
that don't know what
a crack house look like?

15:06.373 --> 15:07.507
Fuck outta here.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.277
Thanks for the help.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.113
<i>Fuck you, Five-O.</i>

15:44.077 --> 15:45.979
- Hey.
- Can I help you?

15:46.079 --> 15:48.014
Here to see Stefano.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.184
Come on.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.121
They're all right, Giorgio.

15:58.024 --> 15:58.725
Stay here.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.063
Hey.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.297
- Hey, Sal.
- Hey.

16:04.431 --> 16:05.432
- How are you?
- Good.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.100
Good to see you.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.572
I swear to God you got taller.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.274
Is that possible?

16:14.407 --> 16:16.076
You still growin',
you cocksucker?

16:17.677 --> 16:20.046
Or did I just get shorter?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.015
That's what it is. I knew it.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.983
Fuck me. I'm shrinkin', huh?

16:24.084 --> 16:25.452
Jesus Christ.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.554
You keep gettin' more handsome,
though, Stefano.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.190
Hey, Sally,
take it easy with that--

16:30.323 --> 16:31.624
that greasy Jersey
bullshit of yours.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.593
I'm not fallin' for it.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.095
I got outta the shower
this morning,

16:35.228 --> 16:36.763
caught myself in the mirror.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.065
<i>Marone a mi,</i>
my balls look ten years younger

16:39.199 --> 16:40.066
than my fuckin' face.

16:43.203 --> 16:47.607
Hey, uh, on a much more
serious note, I, uh...

16:47.707 --> 16:52.145
I was terribly saddened to hear
about the loss of your son.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.347
I-I mean, it's...
it's unbearable.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.349
Well, his mother and I,
we're gonna miss him

16:56.483 --> 16:57.617
for the rest of our lives.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.386
Of course you will.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.323
No child should
predecease their parent.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.726
I appreciate the kind words.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.495
I'll pass them along to Teresa.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.029
Please do.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.235
So, uh, I got an issue

17:15.368 --> 17:17.370
in your neck of the woods here, Stefano,

17:17.504 --> 17:18.738
and it could get
a little hairy,

17:19.072 --> 17:20.507
but before I got loud,
I want to make sure

17:20.640 --> 17:22.575
I checked in with you first.

17:23.777 --> 17:25.779
She visited me.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.281
- Who?
- The Tootsie Roll from Jamaica.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.450
- She came here?
- Uh-huh.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.452
Fuckin' stones on her.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.189
Please accept my apologies
for the bother.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.391
I didn't want this
to become a concern of yours.

17:38.491 --> 17:42.128
Yeah, well, little too late
for that, right, Sally?

17:42.262 --> 17:45.832
All right, look, she told me
about your disagreement,

17:46.166 --> 17:48.802
and I'm gonna tell you
what I told her.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.638
I don't want nothin' to do
with the fuckin' moolies.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.541
All right,
this is your problem, not mine.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.810
Our garbage goes out to Jersey,

17:57.143 --> 17:59.078
not the other way around.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.681
You deal with this quickly
and completely,

18:01.815 --> 18:04.150
and then, Sally, do me a favor.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.152
Stay the fuck on your side
of the river.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.388
You won't hear about it again.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.761
Oh, hey, Sal.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.298
Eh, you know, your dark friend,

18:18.431 --> 18:21.534
she did manage to buy herself
a 29-gallon tank,

18:21.634 --> 18:24.737
couple of bags of bettas,
oscars, and some swordtails.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.275
Let me get the biggest tank
you got.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.312
That a boy, that a boy.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.713
Hey, Giorgio!

18:33.847 --> 18:37.517
Show Mr. Boselli
the Aqua Dream, eh?

18:37.650 --> 18:40.720
<i>Marone a mi,</i> 394 gallons.

18:40.854 --> 18:42.288
I mean, it's so big

18:42.388 --> 18:43.556
you could race fuckin' Flipper
in the thing.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.191
Yeah.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.293
- Okay.
- Okay.

Gettin' work.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.826
Gettin' work?
Is that what you call it?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.594
'Cause to me,
it look like you stealin',

19:21.728 --> 19:24.631
and I know it ain't the first
time you done it neither.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.765
We had a light count
a while back.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.333
I'm thinkin' that was you.

19:27.433 --> 19:30.270
How the hell I'm gonna steal
from myself, Marvin?

19:30.403 --> 19:31.604
This shit belong to me.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.674
Your moms gonna need to know.

19:36.242 --> 19:38.378
I don't give a fuck
what she knows.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.255
You're good.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.266
Were you here at the time?

20:00.366 --> 20:02.502
Maybe.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.572
Did you see or hear anything?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.807
Like what?

20:07.941 --> 20:09.943
Mr. Ventura,
there was a kid shot to death

20:10.276 --> 20:12.412
just a few feet away from where
I'm standing right now.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.948
If you were here,
you would've heard something.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.786
I guess I don't remember.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.424
'Cause that's easy to forget,

20:24.524 --> 20:27.860
someone gettin' shot right
outside your fuckin' door.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.999
If anything happens
to come to you,

20:33.333 --> 20:34.867
reach out.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.446
So 'Nique,
he ain't know nothin',

20:46.546 --> 20:48.314
and I ain't tell him shit.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.883
That nigga 'Nique
only care about 'Nique.

20:51.017 --> 20:51.884
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean,

20:52.018 --> 20:53.987
I can't blame him for that.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.722
Look, I just wanted to know
if he was throwin' in

20:55.822 --> 20:57.557
with these
salami motherfuckers.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.658
Look.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.328
I got some shooters comin' in

21:02.462 --> 21:03.830
to help y'all
put in this work tonight,

21:03.930 --> 21:05.365
and I got assurances
from the don

21:05.498 --> 21:06.599
out at the fish shop
in Howard Beach

21:06.733 --> 21:07.700
that he ain't gonna
be steppin' in.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.035
So ain't no cavalry gonna be

21:09.335 --> 21:10.703
comin' in to back these fools.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.439
No 'Nique, no other
macaroni motherfuckers.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.908
It's just gonna be us and them,
straight up.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.910
Look, I ain't even gonna lie.

21:18.011 --> 21:19.779
All right, it's gonna get worse
before it get better.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.381
That's the rhythm and flow
of this shit.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.782
It always has been.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.384
You know, it ain't always
gonna be predictable.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.818
There gonna be
some twists and turns,

21:25.952 --> 21:27.754
<i>but once we show these
motherfuckers who we are,</i>

21:27.887 --> 21:29.022
ain't nobody gonna
fuck with us,

21:29.322 --> 21:31.491
not here, not there,
not anywhere.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.060
Look, in the big picture,

21:34.394 --> 21:36.329
this shit ain't even
a bump in the road, fellas.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.498
It's a lane change, that's all.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.735
My foot is still
on the fuckin' gas.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.398
Executed, both of 'em.

22:12.532 --> 22:15.968
Execution feels like
a stretch to me.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.970
<i>They're crackheads, Burke.</i>

22:18.104 --> 22:20.740
They most likely died
over crackhead stuff.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.076
Sam was gonna go on the record
about your shooting.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.078
He already did.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.579
He didn't have anything to say.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.381
Well, he remembered something
the other day.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.416
Said he bumped into the shooter
around the neighborhood,

22:30.550 --> 22:32.118
and it knocked something open
in his head.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.353
I liked Sam.

22:34.487 --> 22:37.724
Hell, over the years,
he gave me some solid intel,

22:37.857 --> 22:39.892
<i>but he wasn't
what anyone would describe</i>

22:40.026 --> 22:41.060
<i>as a reliable witness.</i>

22:46.933 --> 22:49.368
What you gettin' at anyway?

22:49.502 --> 22:51.671
Sam catchin' these slugs
is connected to my shooting?

22:51.804 --> 22:54.474
I don't know. You tell me.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.608
Is it connected?

22:58.845 --> 23:01.080
You gotta stop
with this bullshit, Burke.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.704
Hey, are you guys hungry?

23:26.539 --> 23:28.708
- Y'all want something to eat?
- Nah, nah, we good.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.810
Yo, I'll get with you later.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.645
- Yo, you a'ight?
- Nah.

23:32.779 --> 23:33.846
Not at all.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.156
Remember when your little
brother used to be

23:43.489 --> 23:45.158
that nigga we could count on?

23:45.491 --> 23:46.659
Still is, though.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.895
Just don't want nobody
to get hurt, that's all.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.930
Since when you start
takin' up for him?

23:51.063 --> 23:52.632
Kid done left you holdin'
the bag more than anybody.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.033
He ain't hesitate
when a motherfucker

23:54.133 --> 23:56.169
took a shot at me, though.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.172
Kanan came
through Baisley today

23:59.505 --> 24:01.841
to grab up a bunch of work.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.076
Called him out on it.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.812
Told him I was gonna
dime him out to you.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.580
He ain't give a fuck.

24:07.713 --> 24:08.748
Just kept goin'.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.650
How much he take?

24:10.750 --> 24:11.751
Couple G-packs.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.122
Look, I'ma deal with Kanan.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.524
All right, you just focus
on the business at hand.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.526
Show these Italians
that we not fuckin' around.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.745
Laverne Thomas.

24:39.879 --> 24:40.980
Yeah.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.949
You been DAT'd.

24:43.049 --> 24:43.983
By who?

24:44.116 --> 24:45.551
How the fuck would I know?

24:54.794 --> 24:55.928
Hey.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.865
Hey!

24:59.966 --> 25:01.601
When I'm gettin' sprung?

25:01.701 --> 25:03.803
I guess when someone actually
gives a fuck about you.

25:05.538 --> 25:06.706
Bitch.

25:29.896 --> 25:30.963
Laverne.

25:32.265 --> 25:34.166
Of course, it's you.

25:34.267 --> 25:35.268
What can I say?

25:35.601 --> 25:36.269
I guess
I'm your guardian angel.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.804
White cop's my guardian angel.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.239
That shit don't sit right.

25:40.573 --> 25:43.609
Bet you it sits better
than that holding cell.

25:43.743 --> 25:47.079
Look, Laverne, I've helped you
out of some jams,

25:47.213 --> 25:49.282
like this one, for example.

25:49.615 --> 25:51.884
Now I need you
to return the favor.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.155
I need you to tell me something.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.893
Is Detective Howard
your cousin, Kanan's, father?

26:01.027 --> 26:04.297
So, the white detective's
my guardian angel,

26:04.630 --> 26:06.899
and the Black one's
Kanan's daddy.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.634
You got it figured
all the way out.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.103
Is Howard Kanan's father,
Laverne?

26:11.237 --> 26:14.173
Kanan's daddy's Def Con.

26:14.307 --> 26:16.609
That's why his last name
is Stark.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.180
Eh.

26:22.315 --> 26:25.117
Look, maybe you have
helped me out with some shit,

26:25.251 --> 26:26.319
and I do owe you one,

26:26.652 --> 26:28.788
so let me help you right here.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.756
Your own people comin' for you.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.191
Watch your back, Detective.

26:32.325 --> 26:33.993
I don't know what that means.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.929
That means maybe the niggas
you've been ridin' with

26:37.063 --> 26:39.799
ain't checkin' for you
the way you think they are.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.902
Maybe you got a target on you

26:43.035 --> 26:45.738
like all the rest of us
out in these streets,

26:45.871 --> 26:47.807
and that's all I can say.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.747
Ah.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.216
Thanks for the assist up there.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.986
Don't mention it.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.097
- There he is.
- All right, all right.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.700
How you doin'?

27:47.833 --> 27:49.268
I took Washington
and the points.

27:49.402 --> 27:52.171
Fuckin' game goes to OT.
Knicks win by 11.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.073
That's five in a row for them.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.775
Startin' to think they might
be for real after all.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.803
Motherfucker!

28:23.936 --> 28:25.404
Motherfucker.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.174
No shorts.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.408
Got that work. What's up?

28:31.077 --> 28:33.846
No shorts. No shorts.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.371
Cop and move, nigga.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.117
-'Sup?
- What's up?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.018
Yo, I thought your mama wanted
everybody off the corners.

29:13.119 --> 29:15.154
Well, fuck my mother.

29:15.287 --> 29:18.290
I ain't worried about her,
and you not neither.

29:18.424 --> 29:19.758
Okay.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.026
Let's get back to this money.

29:25.865 --> 29:26.999
How many, man?

29:28.467 --> 29:29.468
That way.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.325
Sorry for the delay.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.528
Took me a minute
to find the paperwork.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.329
Like I said, it's not often

29:57.463 --> 29:59.165
that someone comes
into our bank and says

29:59.265 --> 30:02.001
that they have too much money
in their account.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.202
I'm not sayin' it's wrong.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.104
I just wanna know
where it came from.

30:05.237 --> 30:08.340
Uh, your former partner,
Mr. Camacho,

30:08.474 --> 30:10.442
sold 15% of his share
of your business

30:10.543 --> 30:13.045
to an outside investor.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.547
You're looking at the amendment

30:14.880 --> 30:16.849
to the bylaws
of the corporation

30:16.982 --> 30:19.885
that Mr. Camacho and this
investor signed and notarized.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.421
<i>Now, the agreement that
was struck between the parties</i>

30:22.521 --> 30:25.257
<i>specified that in the event
of Mr. Camacho's death</i>

30:25.391 --> 30:28.327
or incapacitation,
his portion of the company

30:28.460 --> 30:30.563
would be offered
to this investor

30:30.896 --> 30:32.565
<i>for purchase
at the current valuation.</i>

30:32.898 --> 30:34.466
The proceeds
of said purchase would go

30:34.600 --> 30:37.002
<i>to Mr. Camacho's mother
after the requisite fees</i>

30:37.136 --> 30:38.571
<i>and taxes were subtracted.</i>

30:38.904 --> 30:41.207
You'll see there
that the buyer's name is--

30:41.307 --> 30:44.210
Raquel Thomas.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.612
And Ms. Thomas now owns
Mr. Camacho's share

30:46.946 --> 30:48.314
of Bulletproof Records.

30:48.447 --> 30:51.183
Occurs to me
you two share a last name.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.018
Any relation?

31:09.201 --> 31:10.903
Y'all hit up
that Russian Tea Room yet?

31:11.036 --> 31:13.172
The only fish Abraham fuck with
is that Filet-O-Fish.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.873
This a low-rent nigga
over here.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.075
I like my shit fried.

31:21.914 --> 31:22.615
My brother Marvin and I
are here

31:22.948 --> 31:24.350
to kick this shit the fuck off.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.452
With Cartier out the way,
Abraham here

31:26.585 --> 31:28.120
free and clear
of that gun charge,

31:28.220 --> 31:29.521
ain't nothin' else stoppin' us.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.290
Now you tell me
how big a package you need,

31:31.423 --> 31:33.959
and I'll get that shit to you
before the end of the week.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.498
Fuck was that?

31:40.466 --> 31:42.001
What's going on?

31:42.134 --> 31:43.969
We don't need your package.
We good.

31:44.103 --> 31:45.604
Fuck you mean, you good?

31:45.938 --> 31:47.573
How the fuck you good
without me?

31:47.906 --> 31:48.607
I cleared the decks
for this shit.

31:48.941 --> 31:49.475
I put the whole shit together.

31:49.608 --> 31:50.976
The point
of gettin' rid of Cartier

31:51.110 --> 31:52.978
was to cut out the middle man,

31:53.112 --> 31:54.280
and that's all you'd be
in this deal,

31:54.380 --> 31:56.148
just someone else
in between us and the dope,

31:56.282 --> 31:58.484
takin' money
out of our pockets.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.252
We don't need that. We good.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.954
We don't need you.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.323
And we heard you got problems
with the Italians anyway.

32:04.456 --> 32:05.624
We don't wanna get
in the middle of all that.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.026
<i>Yeah, where the fuck
you hear that?</i>

32:07.159 --> 32:08.494
Who talkin' to you
about the Italians?

32:08.627 --> 32:11.130
They went around us.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.003
Y'all motherfuckers done
cut your own deal with Joaquin.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.408
This is for Cartier

32:22.508 --> 32:25.344
and for gettin' Abraham
up off that case.

32:25.477 --> 32:26.979
- We even.
- Nah.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.280
We ain't even until I fuck you

32:28.414 --> 32:29.581
the way you just fucked me, nigga.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.686
And my meat is way bigger
than yours.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.157
Good luck.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.604
I don't know
what that cop's doin',

32:52.705 --> 32:54.973
but I do know that none
of what he said is true.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.744
This is why you wanted to meet?

33:02.181 --> 33:05.050
I know you're scared, Laverne.

33:05.718 --> 33:10.255
I know the police
can be intimidating

33:10.389 --> 33:14.460
and corrupt and unfair,

33:14.593 --> 33:16.428
especially in communities
like yours.

33:16.562 --> 33:20.032
That's exactly why I need you
to help me make certain

33:20.132 --> 33:23.535
that Detective Burke doesn't do
what she did to Nicole

33:23.669 --> 33:25.671
to another young girl.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.673
She exploited you both.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.008
She plied you with drugs.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.010
Drugs that...

33:33.445 --> 33:35.481
...drugs that killed
my daughter.

33:39.218 --> 33:42.221
Detective Burke didn't do
anything to Nicole and me.

33:46.091 --> 33:47.593
And she didn't give her
those drugs.

33:52.464 --> 33:56.735
Nicole found those rocks
in my bag.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.805
She took 'em
without me knowing,

34:00.139 --> 34:02.408
and she smoked 'em.

34:02.508 --> 34:05.778
I don't believe you, Laverne.

34:06.111 --> 34:09.214
I know that-that you are
so terrified of the police,

34:09.348 --> 34:11.617
and that you would rather lie
and implicate yourself

34:11.750 --> 34:12.785
rather than confront them.

34:13.118 --> 34:15.120
I will protect you.

34:15.220 --> 34:17.089
I will make sure they don't do
anything to you.

34:17.189 --> 34:18.657
I don't wanna say it any more

34:18.791 --> 34:20.726
than you wanna hear it,
Mr. Bingham,

34:21.059 --> 34:22.761
but I'm telling you the truth.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.666
Nicole got that shit from me.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.571
And I can't be a part
of lyin' on that cop.

34:34.506 --> 34:37.543
I am so sorry, Mr. Bingham,

34:37.676 --> 34:41.113
about Nicole, about everything.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.262
No shorts. No shorts.

35:04.269 --> 35:05.604
You've gotta be shittin' me.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.158
<i>Five-O!</i>

35:26.291 --> 35:27.593
<i>Let's go, man!</i>

35:30.696 --> 35:31.763
You and I need to talk.

35:31.864 --> 35:33.499
Well, I don't talk
to police, so--

35:33.632 --> 35:35.367
Then I'll talk.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.302
The--the--

35:40.405 --> 35:41.640
And you'll listen.

35:46.211 --> 35:47.646
Really?

36:04.696 --> 36:06.465
I need to talk to him.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.775
That was my deal, Joaquin.

36:16.909 --> 36:18.777
I brought it in, I set it up,
and you just gonna cut me out?

36:21.246 --> 36:23.215
It was me.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.317
Your friends came to the store
to talk to me,

36:25.450 --> 36:27.786
and we discovered
that there is a way

36:27.920 --> 36:29.788
to work together without you,

36:29.922 --> 36:32.491
which is better for everyone.

36:32.624 --> 36:35.694
Yeah, well, it doesn't
work better for me.

36:35.827 --> 36:36.862
With all due respect,
this isn't

36:37.195 --> 36:38.797
how business is done, Joaquin.

36:38.931 --> 36:40.299
<i>We don't sell out
our business partners.</i>

36:40.399 --> 36:41.867
I know you know
how this shit work.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.802
You need to check your cousin.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.375
I trust Juliana's
business sense.

36:50.509 --> 36:51.843
Yeah, well,
this isn't business.

36:51.944 --> 36:53.545
All right,
she's still angry with me

36:53.679 --> 36:54.980
for gettin' with 'Nique after
he grabbed her lil' ass up.

36:55.314 --> 36:56.582
That's what this shit is about.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.553
I can find another connect.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.390
Then find one.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.292
Yo, we done here.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.830
Let's bounce
before we say or do somethin'

37:11.964 --> 37:13.699
we gonna regret.

37:13.832 --> 37:16.835
You should listen
to your brother.

37:16.969 --> 37:20.005
You know, you fightin' above
your weight class, Juliana.

37:20.339 --> 37:23.809
When you punchin' up, it ain't
about whether you can throw.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.644
It's how you take.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.558
<i>Mm.</i>

37:55.474 --> 37:56.742
So this is where you shot him?

37:59.344 --> 38:01.713
This is where you shot Howard,
your father?

38:01.813 --> 38:03.482
What the fuck
are you talkin' about, Five-O?

38:03.615 --> 38:04.750
I know everything, Kanan.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.418
Look, I don't know
what you think you know,

38:06.551 --> 38:07.586
but you don't.

38:07.719 --> 38:08.787
Howard was workin'
as an undercover

38:08.920 --> 38:10.622
when he met your mom.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.057
She worked
as an informant for him,

38:12.391 --> 38:13.492
and then their relationship
became something else,

38:13.625 --> 38:14.893
and then you came along.

38:16.028 --> 38:17.596
Come on, Def Con is my father.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.331
- Everybody know that.
- Everybody thinks that.

38:20.565 --> 38:22.300
But you and I know better,

38:22.434 --> 38:24.002
and so do your mother
and Howard.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.740
Is that why you shot him,

38:28.874 --> 38:30.942
because you found out
he was your father?

38:32.010 --> 38:34.646
Because I know it's not
a good look to be a cop's kid.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.048
It's even worse
when your mom was a snitch.

38:36.348 --> 38:39.317
Yo, certain lines
that never get crossed,

38:39.451 --> 38:41.520
not even by Five-O,

38:41.653 --> 38:44.022
so for you to say
some shit like that...

38:49.761 --> 38:51.596
Fuck it.

38:51.730 --> 38:54.466
You just talkin' shit,

38:54.599 --> 38:56.735
like all of you do,
tryin' to get in a nigga head

38:56.868 --> 38:59.471
and make him cop to some shit
that ain't even real.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.474
Fine. Up against the fence.

39:02.574 --> 39:03.508
- I'm arresting you...
- The fuck?

39:03.642 --> 39:04.409
...for possession and sale.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.545
What? Shit!

39:06.678 --> 39:07.579
Yo, I ain't even got
shit on me.

39:07.679 --> 39:08.613
Then I'll flake you.

39:08.747 --> 39:09.948
What the--this is bullshit!

39:10.082 --> 39:11.116
Then tell me what I wanna know.

39:15.654 --> 39:16.621
Shit.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.958
Now you fucked up, Kanan.

39:20.092 --> 39:20.959
Fuck.

39:22.127 --> 39:22.994
<i>Kanan!</i>

39:24.563 --> 39:25.464
You can run, but I know

39:25.597 --> 39:27.065
where to find you, Kanan!

40:56.822 --> 40:58.623
What's goin' on?

40:59.891 --> 41:01.726
Nothin'.
What's goin' on with you?

41:03.161 --> 41:05.063
I thought someone
was robbin' the spot.

41:05.831 --> 41:08.133
Why would I rob my own house?

41:10.635 --> 41:12.571
Right.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.506
Of course.

41:14.639 --> 41:15.841
My bad.

41:21.847 --> 41:24.082
Yo, just so I know,

41:24.216 --> 41:27.719
when you say, "my own house,"

41:27.819 --> 41:30.222
that mean you, uh...

41:30.522 --> 41:31.990
that mean
you livin' here again?

41:34.226 --> 41:36.027
I got tired of sleepin'
on that lumpy-ass bed

41:36.161 --> 41:38.230
at Aunt Raq's, so...

41:38.563 --> 41:40.565
Yeah, that shit was my...

41:40.665 --> 41:42.667
was my bed the whole time
I was growin' up.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.269
No wonder
you're such an asshole.

41:44.569 --> 41:47.539
That might be it.

41:49.608 --> 41:53.511
Um, I gotta do a run.

41:53.612 --> 41:57.115
You wanna, um...
you wanna hit Lamont's after?

41:59.217 --> 42:01.253
Word.

42:02.787 --> 42:04.189
Okay. Yeah.

42:06.224 --> 42:08.994
By the way, um,

42:09.127 --> 42:10.562
where's LT?

42:11.529 --> 42:14.699
Um, I wasn't around
enough for him.

42:16.268 --> 42:18.003
Mutt got lonely
and anxious and shit

42:18.136 --> 42:20.839
and ate three pair
of my gators.

42:22.007 --> 42:23.141
Took him upstate to a breeder

42:23.275 --> 42:25.076
who linked him up
with a bitch--

42:30.849 --> 42:33.718
LT found a girlfriend and...

42:33.852 --> 42:36.221
and a family
and a big-ass yard.

42:36.321 --> 42:38.924
Good for LT.

42:40.592 --> 42:42.160
That was nice of you.

42:48.867 --> 42:52.170
We, um...

42:52.304 --> 42:54.706
we-we gotta take care
of each other, Juke.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.712
We all we got.

44:34.039 --> 44:35.273
So when were you gonna tell me?

44:36.975 --> 44:38.743
I can't do this
with you tonight, Lou.

44:38.877 --> 44:41.179
Now, you know I just got back
from the bank, right?

44:48.386 --> 44:50.155
Let's do the same shit again.

44:50.255 --> 44:51.890
What you got?

44:52.023 --> 44:52.991
You up in my label.

44:53.124 --> 44:54.025
I been in the label.

44:54.159 --> 44:56.161
Your piece was always my piece.

44:56.294 --> 44:58.363
Now I got Crown piece too.

44:58.463 --> 44:59.764
We keep havin'
the same conversation,

44:59.898 --> 45:01.099
but you don't wanna hear me.

45:01.232 --> 45:03.435
Everything you have
is something that I gave you.

45:03.768 --> 45:05.770
You hear what I'm sayin',
baby brother?

45:05.904 --> 45:07.439
You don't own shit.

45:07.772 --> 45:09.240
<i>You're rentin' from me, Lou.</i>

45:09.374 --> 45:11.976
<i>I've bought and I've sold you
a hundred times over, son,</i>

45:12.077 --> 45:14.112
but you just too up
in your own shit to see it.

45:15.380 --> 45:18.316
Was I up in my own shit
last night

45:18.450 --> 45:20.185
when I lit up
them Jersey motherfuckers?

45:20.285 --> 45:23.021
<i>Or was I up in my shit when
you had me hit Kanan's boy?</i>

45:23.154 --> 45:25.857
Because I for damn sure
wasn't up in my shit

45:25.957 --> 45:27.158
when we put down Scrap!

45:27.292 --> 45:28.893
No, no, no,
I put down Scrap, nigga.

45:29.027 --> 45:30.161
You didn't have
the heart for it.

45:30.295 --> 45:31.930
Come on.

45:32.063 --> 45:33.398
You wanna know something, Lou?

45:33.731 --> 45:34.933
I fucked that shit up.

45:37.268 --> 45:39.504
Scrap wasn't no snitch.

45:39.804 --> 45:41.940
It was his damn mama.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.442
Yeah, hittin' him like that
was a mistake,

45:44.776 --> 45:46.478
and I gotta live with that, Lou.

45:46.811 --> 45:49.247
I gotta accept that loss,
and I gotta move the fuck on.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.182
Could you do that? Huh?

45:51.316 --> 45:53.251
Could you carry that, nigga?

45:53.384 --> 45:54.352
Because that's the job.

45:54.452 --> 45:55.820
That's what I do,

45:55.920 --> 45:57.922
because if I don't do that,
y'all don't eat.

45:59.924 --> 46:02.227
<i>We keep doin' this, Lou,</i>

46:02.360 --> 46:05.396
goin' over the same shit,
talkin' the same talk.

46:05.530 --> 46:06.931
Then you're gonna--
you're-you're done,

46:07.065 --> 46:07.999
and you're gonna walk away.

46:08.099 --> 46:10.235
It's just noise, Lou.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.504
Shit that you say
to make yourself believe

46:12.804 --> 46:14.772
something gonna happen
that ain't never gonna happen.

46:14.906 --> 46:16.007
You ain't goin' nowhere,

46:16.107 --> 46:19.210
'cause there ain't nowhere
for you to go.

46:19.344 --> 46:22.213
You know, I keep waitin'
for you to figure it out, Lou,

46:22.347 --> 46:23.982
to see what's as obvious
as the nose

46:24.115 --> 46:25.116
on your motherfuckin' face,

46:25.250 --> 46:26.217
but you ain't never
gonna see it,

46:26.351 --> 46:28.520
so I'm gonna have to say it
out loud for you,

46:28.853 --> 46:30.355
so we can stop havin'
these fuckin' talks,

46:30.488 --> 46:32.323
'cause I'm tired.

46:32.457 --> 46:35.527
So let me make it plain. Hmm?

46:35.827 --> 46:38.263
Let me make this shit
real simple.

46:38.396 --> 46:42.133
I own you, nigga.

46:57.549 --> 46:58.583
Wait, wait, wait.

46:58.917 --> 47:01.019
So you pushed her over
and bounced?

47:01.152 --> 47:03.087
She was gonna run me in
on some bullshit

47:03.188 --> 47:04.556
so she could keep pressing me
about what happened

47:04.889 --> 47:07.458
between you and my mother
back in the day.

47:07.592 --> 47:09.561
She know everything, man.

47:09.894 --> 47:10.595
She don't know everything.

47:10.895 --> 47:12.063
If she knew everything,

47:12.197 --> 47:13.298
she would've never stepped
to you like that.

47:13.431 --> 47:15.500
She thinks she know shit.

47:17.302 --> 47:18.570
She just tryin'
to make sure she right

47:18.903 --> 47:19.837
before she run with it.

47:19.971 --> 47:22.440
Yeah, well, I'm runnin'.

47:22.540 --> 47:24.842
I got the most shit
to run from right now.

47:30.415 --> 47:31.382
Yo...

47:32.617 --> 47:35.119
you, me, and your moms,

47:35.220 --> 47:37.288
we all gotta talk face-to-face.

47:37.422 --> 47:38.456
We gotta get
our story straight,

47:38.590 --> 47:40.525
come up with a plan.

47:42.961 --> 47:45.163
No more bullshit.

47:53.271 --> 47:55.473
All I'm sayin' is that
if something happens to me,

47:55.607 --> 47:57.542
it's not gonna be
what it looks like.

47:57.642 --> 48:00.111
Howard's settin' me up.

48:00.245 --> 48:01.479
And you're thinkin' all this
because of something

48:01.613 --> 48:02.947
a fuckin' high school girl
said to you?

48:03.081 --> 48:05.116
She knows things, Adina,

48:05.216 --> 48:06.584
and most of the time,
she's right.

48:09.254 --> 48:10.555
So what do you think
Howard's planning?

48:10.888 --> 48:13.358
I don't fuckin' know.

48:13.491 --> 48:15.426
The more I know,
the less I know.

48:23.635 --> 48:25.103
Ooh, there you are.

48:25.236 --> 48:26.671
I've been waitin' on you.

48:27.005 --> 48:28.239
Need to get back in the booth.

48:28.373 --> 48:30.141
I ain't workin' up in here,

48:30.275 --> 48:32.043

48:32.176 --> 48:34.512
