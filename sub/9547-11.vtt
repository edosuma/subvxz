WEBVTT

00:00.072 --> 00:01.449
What's the big surprise?

00:02.025 --> 00:03.723
I'm finally going to do it.

00:03.912 --> 00:05.544
I'm gonna take the plunge.

00:07.023 --> 00:09.593
Oh my God!
You're going to buy a cell phone?

00:09.617 --> 00:10.929
No, beeper.

00:11.749 --> 00:12.818
A beeper?

00:13.380 --> 00:16.420
- It's all you need.
- No, Mr. Monk uses beeper anymore.

00:16.491 --> 00:18.615
- They are former history.
- Dr. Kruger has one.

00:18.789 --> 00:21.818
Well, except for doctors. Doctors
use them because they work anywhere

00:21.943 --> 00:24.741
- They are more reliable.
- Reliable is good. That's what we want.

00:25.117 --> 00:27.278
So when you are out with Julie,
or you are on a date,

00:27.293 --> 00:29.235
- I can beep you.
- Hold on, hold on!

00:30.345 --> 00:31.618
The beeper's for me?

00:31.927 --> 00:34.412
Yeah, it's only $29 a month,
you can afford it.

00:34.493 --> 00:37.980
And you want me to pay for it?
That's your big surprise.

00:38.192 --> 00:40.374
Are you.
Are you surprised?

00:40.599 --> 00:42.586
You know what's kinda sad?
I'm not.

00:43.698 --> 00:44.743
Sorry.

00:45.749 --> 00:48.635
Over there, Mr. Monk.
That couple over there.

00:48.971 --> 00:52.145
He's been on the news all week,
their daughter was murdered.

00:52.492 --> 00:54.518
Mr. Monk, they're staring at you.

00:54.711 --> 00:57.534
I think they want to hire you.
They want you to solve the case.

00:57.549 --> 00:58.553
No, thank you.

00:58.568 --> 01:01.144
Mr. Monk, you can't say no.
This was their daughter.

01:01.318 --> 01:03.427
You know how busy I am.
I'm doing my tags,

01:03.449 --> 01:05.381
I'm rotating the coach, cushions,

01:05.827 --> 01:07.705
I'm just going to tell them
I can't do it.

01:11.374 --> 01:13.303
They are gonna start crying, right?

01:13.458 --> 01:14.750
Probably.

01:15.387 --> 01:18.011
They are gonna show me
pictures of their daughter,

01:18.667 --> 01:22.481
pictures of her when she was a kid,
pulling a little red wagon.

01:23.277 --> 01:26.303
Probably a dog in the wagon,
there's always a dog.

01:26.692 --> 01:28.329
Then, they going to start begging,

01:28.624 --> 01:30.859
offering me all the 
money they have,

01:31.225 --> 01:33.478
and they just get to go on,
and on, and on...

01:33.540 --> 01:36.616
police can't do anything,
you're the only one who could help us.

01:37.303 --> 01:39.789
The crying and the weeping
and the pleading.

01:41.418 --> 01:42.769
Okay, fine.

01:43.116 --> 01:44.602
Fine, you win!

01:44.891 --> 01:46.550
I'll take the case.

02:50.021 --> 02:51.590
So she was killed over there.

02:51.993 --> 02:54.557
Yeah.
Under that tree, on that picnic table.

02:55.076 --> 02:58.996
I've got the case file in the car.
It's full of not-very-pretty pictures.

02:59.062 --> 03:00.651
- How long ago?
- Wednesday night.

03:00.719 --> 03:02.041
So five days.

03:02.150 --> 03:04.398
I figured you'd wanna talk
to the guy that found her.

03:04.914 --> 03:05.915
This is Donovan.

03:05.951 --> 03:07.003
- Captain?
- Yeah.

03:07.018 --> 03:08.691
- You remember tom Donovan?
- I do.

03:10.696 --> 03:12.256
Mr. Donovan, thank you for coming.

03:12.807 --> 03:14.738
This is Natalie Teeger, and Adrian Monk.

03:15.331 --> 03:18.722
Mr. Monk has been hired by the Clark
family to look into the case,

03:18.812 --> 03:19.953
if you wouldn't mind.

03:19.968 --> 03:22.697
Yeah, I feel like a broken record.
It was about 1:00 a.m.

03:22.765 --> 03:24.620
I was coming back home from Sacramento.

03:24.635 --> 03:27.999
Tom and his wife own a restaurant
supply company in Rockaway.

03:28.014 --> 03:29.069
He travels a lot.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.103
That's right.
I pulled in here to use facilities.

03:31.118 --> 03:33.831
Was a long drive he was drinking
lots of coffee, and the facilities.

03:33.867 --> 03:34.902
Randy...

03:35.357 --> 03:37.948
Mr. Donovan came all this way.
He's doing us a favor.

03:37.963 --> 03:39.775
I think we ought to let him
tell the story.

03:39.797 --> 03:41.202
I was just filling in the gaps.

03:41.639 --> 03:42.444
Go on.

03:42.462 --> 03:44.214
I got a good look a them
in my headlights,

03:44.232 --> 03:46.392
there five or six of them.
One was clearly the leader.

03:46.407 --> 03:47.672
They call him "father."

03:47.942 --> 03:48.947
Go on.

03:50.212 --> 03:52.030
They were holding her down on that.

03:52.456 --> 03:53.883
That picnic table over there.

03:55.392 --> 03:56.752
They were stabbing her.

03:57.165 --> 03:58.204
She was screaming.

03:58.219 --> 03:59.489
They carved a...

03:59.605 --> 04:01.182
Symbol of the sun into her chest.

04:01.224 --> 04:02.800
I mean, it was like their logo.

04:03.067 --> 04:04.069
They saw me,

04:04.152 --> 04:06.455
they ran to their van, and drove away.
Big silver van.

04:06.470 --> 04:08.227
Which is what they always drive. Go on.

04:08.242 --> 04:10.516
She was still breathing.
I put her in my car.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.395
Drove her to the hospital.

04:13.203 --> 04:14.347
At least I tried to.

04:14.362 --> 04:16.046
She died before we got there.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.183
Did she say anything before she died?

04:18.233 --> 04:19.319
Unfortunately no.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.454
- Yes.
- Yes.

04:21.613 --> 04:23.402
She whispered something. She said

04:24.012 --> 04:26.104
"he found me, father found me."

04:28.294 --> 04:30.714
Thank you very much, mr. Donovan.
You're welcome.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.111
Would you give us a minute?

04:32.797 --> 04:33.810
Yes, sir.

04:39.517 --> 04:40.807
Does all that check out?

04:40.822 --> 04:41.961
Yeah, so far.

04:42.005 --> 04:44.988
We, found hair on the picnic table,
and a lot of blood.

04:45.173 --> 04:46.510
- Hers?
- Yeah.

04:46.525 --> 04:47.981
We had a lineup yesterday.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.364
Brought in the father,
Donovan picked him out.

04:50.637 --> 04:51.650
Positive I.D.

04:52.447 --> 04:54.257
What do we know about this "father"?

04:54.319 --> 04:57.306
Well, his real name is Ralph Roberts,
he used to sell used cars.

04:57.321 --> 05:00.150
Can you believe it? Before he went into
the son of god business.

05:00.165 --> 05:01.617
Nice work if you can get it.

05:01.632 --> 05:04.844
God, just the name creeps me out.
Siblings of the sun. Yeah.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.952
Though we've been talking
to Amanda Clark's parents,

05:06.967 --> 05:09.193
and their daughter left the cult
about a year ago.

05:09.444 --> 05:11.072
"Escaped" is more like it.

05:11.213 --> 05:13.632
Apparently father
got pissed off.

05:13.650 --> 05:16.108
He doesn't like it when people start
thinking for themselves.

05:16.123 --> 05:17.849
The parents said she was scared
to death.

05:17.864 --> 05:19.936
She was sure
he was gonna try to find her.

05:19.951 --> 05:22.058
Well, that checks out,
cause she changed her name,

05:22.073 --> 05:24.594
she moved to north beach,
rented a basement apartment,

05:24.609 --> 05:26.463
and started working off the books.

05:26.543 --> 05:27.562
Doing what?

05:28.057 --> 05:30.661
She became a member
of the world's oldest profession.

05:31.292 --> 05:33.063
Stone mason?

05:34.216 --> 05:35.664
No, prostitute.

05:38.243 --> 05:39.523
So what else do you need?

05:39.538 --> 05:41.319
A little something called evidence.

05:41.910 --> 05:43.929
I'm guessing father had an alibi.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.777
Father has a hundred alibis.

05:45.792 --> 05:48.659
We've been talking to his so-called
children, and every one of them

05:48.674 --> 05:51.197
swears that he never left the compound
on wednesday night.

05:51.314 --> 05:52.387
Send somebody in.

05:53.462 --> 05:54.511
I wish I could,

05:54.526 --> 05:56.334
but the commissioner
won't sign off on it.

05:56.349 --> 05:58.606
These people have, like,
20 lawyers on retainer,

05:58.621 --> 06:00.151
and they love suing cops.

06:00.377 --> 06:02.219
Wait, so that's it?
You're just giving up.

06:02.804 --> 06:03.806
I'll do it.

06:04.143 --> 06:05.233
I'll go undercover.

06:05.572 --> 06:08.574
Forget it, Monk. It's a cult.
You wouldn't last 20 minutes.

06:08.592 --> 06:11.916
This guy Roberts is a Svengali.
He brainwashes people.

06:11.931 --> 06:13.935
I think I can handle myself.

06:13.971 --> 06:15.624
Don't take this personally Monk,

06:15.639 --> 06:17.789
but you're about the most
Gullible person I know.

06:17.853 --> 06:18.865
Gullible?

06:19.064 --> 06:20.528
Gulli-- ? Come on.

06:20.886 --> 06:23.637
Well, it's not just my opinion.
I was talking to Joey Heatherton,

06:23.652 --> 06:24.868
and she agrees with me.

06:26.169 --> 06:27.546
Joey Heatherton, the singer?

06:28.023 --> 06:30.501
Joey... Joey Heatherton,
can you believe it?

06:30.545 --> 06:31.769
Joey Heatherton.

06:32.340 --> 06:33.520
Okay, I'll do it.

06:37.015 --> 06:38.382
Thank you.

06:38.424 --> 06:40.069
Well, there they are.

06:40.245 --> 06:41.408
My new family.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.730
I might not see you for a while,
are you gonna be okay?

06:45.061 --> 06:47.224
You're going undercover,
and you're worried about me?

06:47.239 --> 06:48.262
Yes, I am.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.616
You have a point.

06:49.998 --> 06:51.094
I'm gonna need food.

06:51.109 --> 06:53.031
No, already stocked up.
There's plenty of food.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.380
Beverages. I need beverages.

06:54.395 --> 06:56.234
There's 50 bottles
of water under the sink.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.213
I asked the captain
to check on you every day.

06:59.677 --> 07:00.848
Okay, then.

07:01.158 --> 07:02.817
- I think we're ready.
- Okay.

07:12.846 --> 07:14.205
- Hello.
- Hello.

07:14.328 --> 07:15.560
Do you live around here?

07:15.575 --> 07:16.580
Yeah.

07:16.632 --> 07:17.692
What is all this?

07:17.707 --> 07:19.492
We're a community
of brothers and sisters,

07:19.507 --> 07:21.536
working to make the world
a better place.

07:21.669 --> 07:22.983
Would you like a Pamphlet?

07:22.998 --> 07:25.039
A Pamphlet. How much are they?

07:25.054 --> 07:26.052
It's free.

07:26.067 --> 07:28.827
Go ahead, go ahead. She loves Pamphlets.
Why don't you read it.

07:29.113 --> 07:30.510
The siblings of the sun.

07:30.528 --> 07:32.081
- What's your name?
- Natalie.

07:32.255 --> 07:34.572
And do you have any family
in the area, Natalie?

07:34.587 --> 07:35.835
No, it's just me.

07:38.985 --> 07:40.892
- He's nobody.
- I'm nobody.

07:40.907 --> 07:44.045
Just an old friend.
I literally just bumped into him.

07:44.092 --> 07:45.237
- Crashed.
- Yeah.

07:46.034 --> 07:47.375
It's tough, isn't it?

07:47.619 --> 07:48.970
Without loved ones nearby.

07:48.985 --> 07:51.331
You must feel so disconnected.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.794
It's really funny.
We were just talking about that.

07:53.809 --> 07:55.963
About how she feels
disconnected, remember?

07:56.035 --> 07:57.373
- Exactly.
- Would you like

07:57.388 --> 07:59.013
questionnaire? We could do it here,

07:59.031 --> 08:00.486
or you could come with us.

08:00.501 --> 08:03.236
We have our own ranch up the coast.
I think you'd really enjoy it.

08:03.251 --> 08:06.625
My gosh. Your own ranch?
I've never been to a real ranch.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.475
"World's Greatest mom."

08:09.651 --> 08:11.252
You said you didn't have any family.

08:11.267 --> 08:15.101
Well, except for my daughter,
but, we never talk anymore.

08:15.116 --> 08:17.948
It's. I. I haven't seen her.
It. It's sad.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.049
Excuse me.

08:28.893 --> 08:29.893
Hello.

08:30.577 --> 08:31.894
Yeah, now's not a good time.

08:33.918 --> 08:35.921
Well, how long has Sarah had a license?

08:36.065 --> 08:38.260
No, absolutely not.
I will talk to you later.

08:38.947 --> 08:39.948
Thank you.

08:40.517 --> 08:41.894
Sorry, business call.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.241
Thank you very much.
Have a beautiful day.

08:44.804 --> 08:47.392
Excuse me... May I... May I?

08:51.649 --> 08:52.943
You have your own farm.

08:53.311 --> 08:55.717
Yes. We're completely self-sufficient.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.222
Are, are these beets?

08:57.392 --> 08:58.394
I'm not sure.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.114
I think they are.

09:00.943 --> 09:02.756
- Beets.
- You don't. You don't like beets.

09:02.771 --> 09:04.328
- I love beets.
- Since when?

09:04.384 --> 09:05.740
Since this morning.

09:05.755 --> 09:08.412
I had them for breakfast.
You weren't there. She wasn't there.

09:09.297 --> 09:10.433
I was just feeling...

09:10.857 --> 09:13.093
Sad and...
Disconnected.

09:13.797 --> 09:16.336
Just me and... Me and my beets.

09:16.620 --> 09:17.711
What's your name?

09:17.761 --> 09:18.613
Adrian.

09:18.628 --> 09:20.462
And do you have any children, Adrian?

09:20.480 --> 09:22.004
No. None.

09:22.463 --> 09:24.121
I think we can help you, Adrian.

09:24.192 --> 09:27.428
Well, Adrian isn't interested.
He has. To get home.

09:27.705 --> 09:29.959
Right? You have that... thing.
Remember?

09:30.359 --> 09:32.466
Yeah. I cancelled that thing.
I'm fine.

09:32.481 --> 09:34.343
We can put order back
in your life, Adrian.

09:34.358 --> 09:35.367
How's that sound?

09:35.454 --> 09:38.871
Why don't you come with us? We can tell
you all about it at the meeting.

09:38.951 --> 09:40.077
That sounds great.

09:42.232 --> 09:43.233
Bring the van.

09:46.874 --> 09:49.294
What are you doing?
This was supposed to be me.

09:49.309 --> 09:51.162
Well, they don't want you.

09:51.193 --> 09:52.642
This is plan B.

09:53.607 --> 09:55.323
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

09:55.578 --> 09:58.958
I got them right where I want them.
They think i'm some kind of boob.

10:00.311 --> 10:01.956
Adrian! Time to go.

10:02.860 --> 10:04.800
Can I sit up front?
I always sit up front.

10:05.278 --> 10:07.876
- Of course you can sit up front.
- Yeah.

10:07.984 --> 10:10.111
Whatever you want, Adrian.
Whatever makes you happy.

10:10.129 --> 10:11.155
Okay, great.

10:26.170 --> 10:27.656
We own the Whole Mountain.

10:28.059 --> 10:29.847
Over 4,000 acres.

10:30.478 --> 10:33.143
We have food, water, solar power...

10:33.831 --> 10:36.559
We never even need to leave the ranch.
Most of us don't.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.966
The system is going to fail, adrian.

10:41.437 --> 10:44.929
A great blanket of darkness will descend
and when it does, we'll be ready.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.340
We'll be ready.

10:46.809 --> 10:47.967
Will you be ready?

10:48.392 --> 10:51.557
I don't know. To be honest, this is
the first I've ever heard about the...

10:51.980 --> 10:53.661
Whole blanket of darkness deal.

10:54.069 --> 10:55.679
Brother ted, sister Sally!

10:55.964 --> 10:57.824
It's a wonderful day in paradise.

10:58.558 --> 10:59.559
Welcome.

11:01.216 --> 11:03.773
We make extra money
selling flowers in town.

11:04.530 --> 11:05.530
They seem happy.

11:06.029 --> 11:07.292
Of course they're happy.

11:07.832 --> 11:09.674
It's easy to be happy, Adrian.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.319
All you have to do is let yourself go.

11:13.239 --> 11:14.902
You know, I used to be like you.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.776
My whole life was stress.

11:16.830 --> 11:19.138
Numbers, and money,
I was depressed all the time.

11:19.153 --> 11:20.650
I was living on the street,

11:20.762 --> 11:21.817
like an animal.

11:22.607 --> 11:23.618
What happened?

11:23.633 --> 11:24.657
We found father.

11:24.712 --> 11:25.776
It was that simple.

11:25.794 --> 11:27.554
- Praise be he.
- Praise be he.

11:28.059 --> 11:30.366
So everybody here is happy?

11:31.008 --> 11:32.170
There he is.

11:35.106 --> 11:36.632
He sure doesn't seem worried.

11:37.417 --> 11:38.417
About what?

11:38.695 --> 11:40.197
By the girl who was killed.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.265
- According to the newspapers.
- The devil rags.

11:43.518 --> 11:45.556
That's what I meant, thank you,
the devil rags.

11:45.745 --> 11:48.083
The police
think he might have been involved.

11:49.719 --> 11:51.329
Does he ever talk about the case?

11:51.937 --> 11:52.939
Not to us.

11:54.696 --> 11:56.001
Did you know her well,

11:56.303 --> 11:57.340
the girl who died?

11:57.570 --> 11:59.634
Sister Clark betrayed us all.

11:59.706 --> 12:01.542
Amanda Clark didn't die last week.

12:01.781 --> 12:04.309
As far as we're concerned,
she's been dead for over a year.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.051
She died the day she left.

12:09.987 --> 12:11.618
And that's the new dining hall.

12:11.860 --> 12:12.860
Are you hungry?

12:13.740 --> 12:18.440
O/~ Father, please protect me o/~

12:18.699 --> 12:22.598
o/~ Father, please correct me o/~

12:24.409 --> 12:25.411
That's beautiful.

12:25.675 --> 12:27.585
- Thinks.
- It's a birthday gift for father.

12:27.719 --> 12:28.810
My gift is my song.

12:30.092 --> 12:31.237
Well he's gonna...

12:31.588 --> 12:32.626
You know, love it.

12:33.388 --> 12:34.917
Are you Zack? Brother Zack?

12:34.977 --> 12:35.978
Yeah.

12:36.196 --> 12:39.416
I heard the cops were hassling you
about the murder.

12:39.529 --> 12:41.147
I talked to them twice already.

12:41.307 --> 12:42.666
They're bringing everybody in.

12:42.756 --> 12:43.775
Yeah.

12:44.410 --> 12:45.411
Bummer.

12:46.807 --> 12:47.891
Bummer city.

12:47.906 --> 12:48.940
Yeah.

12:49.027 --> 12:51.078
But they said i'm like a key witness,

12:51.114 --> 12:52.673
cause I was on security detail,

12:52.708 --> 12:53.897
you know, the night

12:54.494 --> 12:57.147
she... died. I was stationed right
in front of father's cabin.

12:57.909 --> 12:59.465
You know, i'm his alibi.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.714
And you were there all night, right?

13:01.839 --> 13:02.841
I never left.

13:02.877 --> 13:03.891
You're sure.

13:04.127 --> 13:05.397
You could see him.

13:06.238 --> 13:07.758
Well, no, but I heard him.

13:07.908 --> 13:08.999
I heard him talking.

13:09.830 --> 13:10.875
To. To who?

13:11.308 --> 13:12.496
Well, talking to god.

13:12.637 --> 13:13.445
Yeah.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.319
Father and god talk all the time.

13:15.687 --> 13:17.046
I heard him cooking something,

13:17.082 --> 13:19.529
you know, cause I could hear
the microwave oven beeping,

13:19.594 --> 13:21.186
"beep, beep, beep."

13:22.390 --> 13:23.391
Maybe...

13:23.683 --> 13:26.146
Maybe he snuck away
when you weren't looking.

13:27.802 --> 13:29.168
You sound like a cop.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.310
Me? No.

13:30.842 --> 13:32.236
I'm not, no.

13:32.456 --> 13:33.458
No.

13:33.890 --> 13:34.926
Freeze.

13:35.351 --> 13:38.173
No, don't freeze.
Play, all right.

13:41.996 --> 13:43.016
Hello.

14:18.350 --> 14:19.360
Hello.

14:20.282 --> 14:21.283
May I help you?

14:21.513 --> 14:22.514
Sorry.

14:22.913 --> 14:24.417
No, I...
I was just.

14:24.882 --> 14:25.963
I was looking for.

14:26.997 --> 14:28.661
I just wanted to be alone, and...

14:29.484 --> 14:30.641
But you are not alone.

14:31.439 --> 14:32.441
Not anymore.

14:33.398 --> 14:35.205
We are here to share your burden...

14:35.848 --> 14:36.848
Adrian.

14:37.413 --> 14:38.748
That is your name, isn't it?

14:39.619 --> 14:40.629
Yes.

14:41.090 --> 14:42.663
Have you had a chance to look around?

14:43.732 --> 14:45.297
And how do you feel being here?

14:45.928 --> 14:47.144
Feels right, doesn't it?

14:48.107 --> 14:50.092
It feels like home, doesn't it?

14:54.256 --> 14:55.363
Something's missing.

14:58.082 --> 14:59.298
Something in you.

14:59.949 --> 15:00.962
Something that

15:01.205 --> 15:02.242
was in you.

15:03.332 --> 15:04.906
A light that's been extinguished.

15:09.234 --> 15:10.262
What was her name?

15:15.029 --> 15:16.156
Trudy.

15:16.346 --> 15:17.427
Her name was Trudy.

15:19.279 --> 15:21.553
I can see that you
feel lost without her.

15:23.563 --> 15:25.209
You came here with questions.

15:26.581 --> 15:28.978
I might be able to answer
some of those questions.

15:33.229 --> 15:34.392
I want you to have it.

15:36.005 --> 15:37.005
Read it.

15:37.563 --> 15:38.678
The more you read it,

15:39.107 --> 15:40.216
the more you know.

15:42.545 --> 15:43.672
The more you know...

15:45.431 --> 15:46.647
The less you don't know.

15:48.813 --> 15:51.799
- The more you know, the.
- The less you don't know.

16:02.242 --> 16:03.243
Ted.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.887
Hello, brother Ted, i'm talking to you.

16:14.338 --> 16:17.307
I could book you for obstruction
right now. Are you listening to me?

16:17.793 --> 16:18.812
Lieutenant,

16:18.996 --> 16:20.688
are you listening to yourself?

16:24.799 --> 16:25.916
Meditate on this,

16:26.234 --> 16:28.580
we know Amanda Clark
was one of father's favorites,

16:28.679 --> 16:29.977
one of the chosen children.

16:29.992 --> 16:31.836
They lived together
for a year and a half.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.092
That was her choice.

16:33.107 --> 16:35.568
Plus we have an eye witness
who saw father

16:35.583 --> 16:36.703
at that rest stop,

16:36.810 --> 16:37.810
that night.

16:37.887 --> 16:40.086
- Impossible.
- He was stabbing her, Ted.

16:40.525 --> 16:42.349
An he's been positively identified.

16:42.518 --> 16:44.776
Father hasn't left the ranch
in three weeks.

16:45.081 --> 16:46.214
How do you know that?

16:46.337 --> 16:48.393
He never leaves for harvest season.

16:49.323 --> 16:50.333
Really?

16:50.633 --> 16:51.647
Never.

16:52.215 --> 16:54.524
What if he gets sick,
and he has to go to the hospital?

16:54.587 --> 16:55.919
Father doesn't get sick.

16:56.437 --> 16:57.942
He's never even had a headache.

16:58.170 --> 16:59.557
He's going to live forever.

16:59.662 --> 17:01.397
He is the eternal one.

17:01.973 --> 17:03.386
The nurturing light.

17:04.525 --> 17:06.582
The nurturing light.
What if he got hit by a bus?

17:06.599 --> 17:09.215
I bet would put his nurturing
light out pretty quick wouldn't it?

17:09.233 --> 17:10.964
There are no buses on the ranch.

17:11.318 --> 17:12.958
What if a bus careens off the highway,

17:13.169 --> 17:15.982
you know smashes through the fence
rolls onto the farm, runs him over?

17:15.997 --> 17:17.829
The highway is seven miles away.

17:17.964 --> 17:19.369
What if it careens seven miles?

17:19.385 --> 17:20.694
It can't careen seven miles.

17:20.709 --> 17:22.589
I've seen vehicles Careen
a pretty long way.

17:22.605 --> 17:24.138
- Not seven miles.
- It's possible.

17:24.248 --> 17:27.130
I once saw a truck lose his breaks
on route 15, near Avalon Mountain,

17:27.145 --> 17:28.943
it's started careening in full spee.
Hey!

17:29.345 --> 17:32.208
Hey, you listening to me, Ted?
Philipsburg, careening in Philipsburg.

17:32.226 --> 17:34.009
Do you know where Philipsburg is, Ted?

17:40.991 --> 17:42.201
Natalie, where is Monk?

17:42.363 --> 17:43.376
Change of plans.

17:43.966 --> 17:46.811
It was a last-minute thing,
but Mr. Monk joined the cult.

17:46.876 --> 17:49.255
- He what?
- I couldn't help it. They wanted him.

17:49.845 --> 17:53.037
Of course they wanted him, Natalie.
He's like play-doh to them.

17:53.052 --> 17:55.281
No, no, no. He seemed okay. He waved

17:55.370 --> 17:57.450
like he was okay as he got into the van.

17:57.465 --> 17:59.175
- He did.
- He waved like.

18:00.289 --> 18:01.426
Come here, Natalie.

18:01.441 --> 18:02.583
Look at this guy.

18:02.824 --> 18:06.794
18 months ago, he was teaching at MIT.
He was considered a genius.

18:06.829 --> 18:08.495
Now he's a complete basket case.

18:08.510 --> 18:10.287
Can you imagine
what they're doing to Monk?

18:10.321 --> 18:13.269
Don't underestimate mr. Monk.
He's a lot stronger than you think.

18:41.270 --> 18:43.760
Okay.
As you people know,

18:44.439 --> 18:46.711
I have never been sick

18:46.974 --> 18:47.976
a day in my life.

18:50.352 --> 18:51.514
- People ask me
- <i>Yes.</i>

18:51.544 --> 18:53.272
How do I do it. What is my secret?

18:53.287 --> 18:55.764
Is there some sort
of special prescription?

18:56.221 --> 18:57.420
Some sort of...

18:57.798 --> 18:59.083
New age medicine?

19:03.475 --> 19:04.552
No, the only

19:04.731 --> 19:07.825
medication I've been taking
is four milligrams

19:07.950 --> 19:09.000
of the light!

19:11.244 --> 19:13.676
To be taken as needed.

19:18.007 --> 19:20.940
We have a new member
of the family.

19:21.456 --> 19:22.936
I want you to welcome him.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.405
Brother Adrian,

19:26.849 --> 19:28.727
I am sensing fear. You are filled

19:29.335 --> 19:30.801
- with fear.
-That is true.

19:31.752 --> 19:33.330
What, what are you afraid of, Adrian?

19:33.811 --> 19:34.811
Fire...

19:35.447 --> 19:36.589
You're afraid of fire?

19:37.555 --> 19:39.497
Well I have some good news for you.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.685
...and heights.

19:41.726 --> 19:42.728
And heights.

19:43.760 --> 19:44.769
Okay.

19:44.822 --> 19:46.851
Then today is your lucky day.

19:46.896 --> 19:47.897
Germs,

19:48.751 --> 19:49.752
needles,

19:50.204 --> 19:53.230
milk, crowds, spiders, sand...

19:53.245 --> 19:54.897
That is quite a list.

19:55.651 --> 19:57.522
You have been living in darkness.

19:57.537 --> 19:59.157
Yeah, darkness, yes.

20:00.143 --> 20:01.180
Elevators,

20:01.589 --> 20:04.190
earthquakes, mushrooms,
tigers and boats.

20:04.205 --> 20:05.341
What about charcoal?

20:05.373 --> 20:06.387
Charcoal...

20:08.693 --> 20:09.698
Yes.

20:12.862 --> 20:13.872
No.

20:17.916 --> 20:20.359
- You have dirt on your hand, brother.
- Wipe.

20:21.141 --> 20:22.594
Wipe.
Wipe.

20:22.796 --> 20:23.797
No.

20:25.077 --> 20:26.078
No.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.592
Don't wipe that off.

20:28.724 --> 20:29.724
Listen to me.

20:29.870 --> 20:31.043
These wipes you carry

20:31.058 --> 20:32.102
are a crutch.

20:33.402 --> 20:34.465
You're with me now.

20:35.065 --> 20:36.335
You don't need the wipes.

20:38.832 --> 20:39.967
Drop the wipe.

20:40.268 --> 20:41.705
Drop. Drop the wipe?

20:41.827 --> 20:42.827
It's okay.

20:44.824 --> 20:46.388
Just give up.

20:47.220 --> 20:48.319
Just surrender.

20:49.065 --> 20:50.281
Surrender?

20:57.615 --> 20:58.678
Let it go.

20:59.949 --> 21:00.951
That wipe

21:02.501 --> 21:04.295
Is like a chain, Adrian.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.102
It's dragging you down.

21:07.598 --> 21:09.064
Set yourself free.

21:09.579 --> 21:10.992
Let yourself live.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.693
You can do it.

21:18.927 --> 21:20.071
Drop the wipe.

21:36.829 --> 21:37.956
I'm free.

21:40.653 --> 21:41.734
I'm free.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.277
- Randy, hang up the phone.
- I'm on hold, just waiting

22:10.292 --> 22:12.500
- to get one of the representatives.
- I don't care.

22:19.631 --> 22:21.681
- I found him.
- Mr. Monk? Yeah.

22:21.696 --> 22:24.295
- Thank god. Is he okay?
- I don't know. It's complicated.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.824
- Where is he?
- He's at the airport. He sold me this.

22:26.868 --> 22:28.109
I barely recognized him.

22:28.124 --> 22:30.648
He was wearing one of those yellow
shirts, and he was smiling.

22:30.663 --> 22:33.509
- Did you talk to him about the case?
- Yeah I tried. I took him aside.

22:33.524 --> 22:35.215
I said, "did you learn anything?"

22:35.351 --> 22:37.141
- What did he say?
- He said, "Leland,

22:37.810 --> 22:39.050
I've learned everything."

22:39.718 --> 22:40.783
That's not good.

22:41.230 --> 22:42.492
And he kept smiling.

22:42.507 --> 22:43.701
That's not good.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.116
They all have ten petals.

22:51.899 --> 22:52.936
Ten petals.

22:58.049 --> 22:59.230
Beautifully done.

23:00.010 --> 23:01.127
Well done.

23:03.223 --> 23:04.242
Monsoon.

23:04.745 --> 23:06.764
Make sure they're all diagonally cut.

23:07.748 --> 23:09.876
Brother Zack.
Brother Zack what are you doing?

23:09.917 --> 23:12.343
You're mixing the Gloriosa
lies with the calathiums.

23:12.420 --> 23:13.434
Sorry.

23:14.303 --> 23:16.199
We cannot afford any mistakes.

23:16.845 --> 23:18.998
I promised father
we'd sell a thousand of these

23:19.013 --> 23:20.526
by the end of the week.

23:21.469 --> 23:22.700
Don't worry. I'm not mad.

23:22.715 --> 23:24.939
I'm not mad. I like you, Zack.

23:24.954 --> 23:26.659
I like your enthusiasm.

23:26.856 --> 23:29.127
You remind me of myself
when I first got here.

23:29.382 --> 23:30.518
You've only been here.

23:30.533 --> 23:32.417
I'm gonna tell father
how well you're doing.

23:32.432 --> 23:33.514
Brother Adrian!

23:35.692 --> 23:37.026
Sister Sally, brother Ted,

23:37.041 --> 23:38.487
it's a beautiful day in paradise.

23:38.502 --> 23:39.784
Father wants to see you.

23:46.741 --> 23:47.947
Adrian, come in.

23:50.588 --> 23:51.787
Would you like some tea?

23:52.482 --> 23:55.038
I have five cups a day.
It's my only vice.

23:55.053 --> 23:56.261
No, no, no. Thank you.

23:56.967 --> 23:59.950
You should be honored. Most of
my children never set foot in here.

24:00.806 --> 24:01.826
It's charming.

24:02.299 --> 24:03.634
How did it go at the airport?

24:03.649 --> 24:04.784
Nine hundred dollars.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.220
Excellent.
And the train station?

24:07.333 --> 24:09.743
Not so good. 70, maybe 75.

24:10.591 --> 24:12.290
Brother Zack, he's meek.

24:12.793 --> 24:14.524
They say the meek
shall inherit the earth.

24:14.539 --> 24:15.738
They say many things.

24:16.131 --> 24:17.711
That is why we cleanse.

24:19.215 --> 24:20.314
It's not boiling.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.105
You're unplugged.

24:24.369 --> 24:25.375
That's all.

24:26.738 --> 24:27.801
Hold on.

24:31.248 --> 24:32.285
I'll do it.

24:32.599 --> 24:33.958
Please, let me.

24:43.651 --> 24:44.651
You dropped this?

24:45.723 --> 24:47.011
Must have fallen off a pen.

24:48.169 --> 24:49.170
Adrian.

24:50.163 --> 24:51.737
Is there something you wanna tell me?

24:53.821 --> 24:55.820
Sister Gina has a radio.

24:57.149 --> 24:58.168
No.

24:58.954 --> 25:00.125
About yourself.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.669
I am not an idiot.

25:06.684 --> 25:08.139
I read the papers.

25:08.422 --> 25:10.294
I know the name Adrian Monk.

25:11.598 --> 25:13.118
The police sent you, didn't they?

25:16.972 --> 25:19.818
I'm sorry about what happened
to Amanda Clark.

25:21.027 --> 25:22.108
I was angry

25:22.239 --> 25:23.338
when she left,

25:23.403 --> 25:25.107
and hurt, I don't deny that.

25:25.987 --> 25:27.329
I might have said some...

25:28.017 --> 25:29.581
Intemperate things,

25:29.826 --> 25:32.047
but I did not kill that girl.

25:32.260 --> 25:34.169
I did not have her killed.

25:35.318 --> 25:37.480
Go back to your Captain Stottlemeyer,

25:37.516 --> 25:39.590
and you tell him he's making a mistake.

25:39.818 --> 25:41.785
You tell him to look some place else.

25:45.477 --> 25:46.709
I can't, I can't, I...

25:47.525 --> 25:49.287
I can't leave. I can't leave.

25:49.302 --> 25:50.323
Father, please.

25:50.889 --> 25:54.044
It's true. When I came here,
I was working on the case.

25:56.051 --> 25:57.267
But that isn't me.

25:58.445 --> 26:01.271
Not anymore.
I can see that now. I belong

26:01.511 --> 26:03.871
here with all of you. I love it here.

26:05.654 --> 26:06.656
I love...

26:07.579 --> 26:08.831
Not thinking.

26:10.573 --> 26:13.686
Cause I'm so tired
of thinking.

26:16.291 --> 26:17.293
Please...

26:19.106 --> 26:20.733
Just,
please.

26:21.604 --> 26:22.605
Okay.

26:22.931 --> 26:23.931
You can stay.

26:24.678 --> 26:25.678
It's okay.

26:26.549 --> 26:27.812
You don't have to think.

26:30.292 --> 26:31.292
Thank you.

26:32.171 --> 26:33.413
I'm so thankful.

26:34.974 --> 26:36.362
I'm gonna make you prove that.

26:42.898 --> 26:44.595
32 thousand dollars?

26:44.700 --> 26:46.918
- Is this all you have?
- I wish I had more.

26:47.020 --> 26:48.706
- What about your brother?
- Ambrose?

26:48.721 --> 26:52.541
- Doesn't he own his own house?
- Yeah, I could talk to him, but.

26:52.913 --> 26:53.973
Natalie?

26:53.988 --> 26:56.093
- Mr. Monk, it's for your own good.
- What are you?

26:56.147 --> 26:58.236
Hey, wait! What are you doing?

26:58.251 --> 26:59.910
You can't do this! Brother Adrian!

27:00.451 --> 27:03.151
Believe in father,
father will set you free!

27:03.319 --> 27:04.335
Brother Adrian!

27:16.106 --> 27:17.125
Hello.

27:18.683 --> 27:20.007
Mr. Monk, are you hungry?

27:20.405 --> 27:21.681
You can't keep me here.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.567
It's against the law.

27:23.645 --> 27:26.025
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.
We didn't know what else to do.

27:27.825 --> 27:30.150
Father warned us
this would happen.

27:33.092 --> 27:34.093
Here.

27:35.807 --> 27:37.305
You haven't eaten all day.

27:39.494 --> 27:40.494
What is it?

27:40.805 --> 27:42.548
Chicken pot pie. It's your favorite.

27:42.864 --> 27:45.043
I don't eat anything
I haven't grown myself.

27:45.058 --> 27:46.408
You don't know me...

27:47.156 --> 27:48.265
At all.

27:48.418 --> 27:49.696
Yes, I do.

27:50.262 --> 27:52.058
I'm here because you don't know you.

27:52.162 --> 27:53.172
Natalie...

27:53.722 --> 27:56.673
If you let me go now,
I won't press charges.

27:57.138 --> 27:58.158
I promise.

28:02.086 --> 28:03.660
Please, just eat something.

28:03.705 --> 28:04.786
Please, just eat.

28:08.911 --> 28:10.010
I'll get a wipe.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.461
He wouldn't eat.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.550
He'll eat.
Eventually.

28:30.565 --> 28:32.468
He acted like I was trying
to poison him.

28:32.552 --> 28:34.566
I feel like the mother
in "the exorcist."

28:34.905 --> 28:37.752
Leland, why don't you go in
and talk to him.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.774
But, leave your watch here

28:41.789 --> 28:45.007
so that he doesn't know what time it is.
We want to keep him disoriented.

28:46.044 --> 28:47.360
That shouldn't be too hard.

28:48.770 --> 28:49.851
How you doin'?

28:52.846 --> 28:54.961
What's the matter?
Father got your tongue?

28:58.587 --> 28:59.692
I brought you a gift.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.925
You remember the Amanda Clark case.

29:04.165 --> 29:05.310
Remember her parents?

29:05.637 --> 29:07.007
And the promise that you made?

29:09.635 --> 29:11.081
Maybe you remember this.

29:11.272 --> 29:12.549
What was done to her.

29:14.187 --> 29:15.187
It wasn't him.

29:15.695 --> 29:17.948
Look, we've got an eyewitness.

29:17.992 --> 29:21.517
He was seen attacking her.
She was 22 years old.

29:21.987 --> 29:23.355
It couldn't have been him.

29:24.746 --> 29:27.518
As father says, we don't hate
our enemies,

29:28.104 --> 29:29.284
we pity them.

29:30.850 --> 29:33.470
Well, it looks like your father
pitied this poor girl to death.

29:33.556 --> 29:34.969
I pity you, Leland.

29:39.745 --> 29:43.321
Father please protect me.

29:44.038 --> 29:45.666
Father please...

29:45.839 --> 29:48.410
- Hey, Monk.
- Father please protect me.

29:48.749 --> 29:50.877
Father please...

29:51.350 --> 29:52.163
Monk!

30:11.470 --> 30:12.470
Guess I'm up.

30:21.524 --> 30:22.579
Let's do it.

30:30.751 --> 30:32.579
Hey, Monk,
how's it going'?

30:33.122 --> 30:34.303
Hello, Randy.

30:36.621 --> 30:37.933
Listen, I just...

30:38.270 --> 30:41.278
Have a couple of things to say
about this so-called father of yours...

30:43.832 --> 30:45.315
I think the guy's a joke.

30:45.330 --> 30:46.886
I mean, have you read this?

30:48.099 --> 30:49.100
Have you?

30:51.017 --> 30:55.074
-<i> Father please correct me.</i>
- God, he's singing again.

30:55.164 --> 30:57.273
That's not Monk. It's okay.

30:58.260 --> 30:59.598
I'll take care of it.

31:00.616 --> 31:05.194
<i>Father please mend me.</i>

31:05.971 --> 31:10.442
- <i>Father please correct me.</i>
- Randy?

31:11.129 --> 31:15.168
- Randy?
- <i>Father please correct me.</i>

31:15.183 --> 31:17.220
Randy!
Thank you, randy.

31:17.236 --> 31:19.700
We'll meet you back in the living room.
Thank you, really.

31:19.715 --> 31:21.067
Nice, nice job.

31:21.994 --> 31:23.925
Good work. Thank you, Randy.

31:24.896 --> 31:26.022
Thanks for coming.

31:28.598 --> 31:29.598
I...

31:29.844 --> 31:31.003
Should go to the bank.

31:33.528 --> 31:35.620
Someone wanna keep an eye on Randy?

31:38.304 --> 31:39.938
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Good.

31:40.261 --> 31:42.640
No reason to be.
Can I sit down?

31:47.021 --> 31:50.415
The siblings of the sun.
You know, I had some dealings with them.

31:50.430 --> 31:55.180
About three years ago, they
tried to recruit Harold Krenshaw, but

31:56.109 --> 31:58.220
Harold was too smart for them.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.698
Nice try, doc.

32:03.564 --> 32:05.030
I know all your tricks.

32:05.664 --> 32:08.345
Psychiatry was invented by the devil.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.730
Really?

32:10.779 --> 32:14.383
- See, I, i didn't know that.
- That is not just my opinion.

32:15.022 --> 32:16.344
- That's a fact.
- A fact?

32:17.214 --> 32:18.233
Like, like

32:18.608 --> 32:21.541
all the facts in this book. Like...oh,

32:23.071 --> 32:24.788
"money begets envy.

32:25.069 --> 32:27.473
Envy is the root of all evil. "
you believe that?

32:27.488 --> 32:28.589
If it's in the book.

32:30.219 --> 32:31.793
Cause the father

32:32.290 --> 32:34.776
doesn't believe it.
He's worth 20 million bucks.

32:36.060 --> 32:37.526
He lives in a cabin.

32:37.544 --> 32:39.797
He has seven other houses.

32:40.741 --> 32:41.742
Adrian...

32:42.104 --> 32:43.400
They did a...

32:43.478 --> 32:46.003
An expose on him last year.

32:46.310 --> 32:48.280
See, now, this here is a

32:48.796 --> 32:51.156
little shack in the Cayman Islands.

32:51.713 --> 32:55.423
He owns parking lots, karate schools,
a cable news channel.

32:55.438 --> 32:57.827
Looks like your messiah's
been a pretty busy guy.

33:00.651 --> 33:02.296
He's using you, Adrian.

33:02.995 --> 33:05.380
That's what he does. That's all

33:06.215 --> 33:07.234
he does.

33:10.825 --> 33:11.845
I love him.

33:12.786 --> 33:14.020
He's taught me

33:14.828 --> 33:16.703
what love really means.

33:19.047 --> 33:22.189
That's funny.
That's what you used to say about Trudy.

33:23.889 --> 33:26.155
I wonder what she would say
if she were here.

33:30.713 --> 33:31.821
She's not here.

33:36.642 --> 33:37.642
Father's here.

33:40.662 --> 33:42.593
Well, then I guess

33:44.775 --> 33:46.671
we can just throw this out, right?

34:07.561 --> 34:10.172
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:40.914 --> 34:41.914
Trudy.

34:46.431 --> 34:47.730
Welcome back.

34:54.900 --> 34:55.955
Your beeper.

34:56.185 --> 34:58.665
Yeah, sorry. Doctors have to carry them.

35:04.537 --> 35:05.539
You're all right?

35:06.962 --> 35:08.822
I think I just solved the case.

35:17.582 --> 35:18.610
Mr. Donovan.

35:18.956 --> 35:19.956
Hello, again.

35:20.203 --> 35:21.308
Captain Stottlemeyer.

35:21.518 --> 35:22.842
Sorry to bother you, sir.

35:23.290 --> 35:25.436
I'm not. I'm not sorry at all.

35:25.489 --> 35:27.279
W, what's going on?
Is there any news?

35:27.294 --> 35:28.821
You remember Adrian Monk?

35:29.096 --> 35:31.575
He just spent five days
with Ralph Roberts

35:31.590 --> 35:32.863
at the sibling ranch.

35:32.878 --> 35:34.113
Good. What did you learn?

35:34.176 --> 35:35.178
Two things,

35:35.214 --> 35:37.252
people don't like being stopped
at the airport,

35:37.832 --> 35:39.173
and you're hiding something.

35:39.611 --> 35:41.342
You killed her.
Didn't you?

35:42.107 --> 35:43.112
John?

35:43.359 --> 35:44.592
Is everything all right?

35:44.932 --> 35:46.292
I'm not sure.

35:46.349 --> 35:48.262
My wife Susan.
These men are with the police.

35:48.277 --> 35:50.844
They just accused me
of murdering that poor girl.

35:50.915 --> 35:51.733
What?

35:51.828 --> 35:54.703
You must be joking. Everyone knows
who killed her. It was that wack-job.

35:54.718 --> 35:56.630
- That cult leader.
- I thought so too, ma'am.

35:56.645 --> 35:58.522
We all did, but that wack-job

35:58.537 --> 36:01.874
was definitely 140 miles away
in his cabin on the night of the murder.

36:01.889 --> 36:04.398
We know that father was there,
because he wasn't alone.

36:04.615 --> 36:05.884
I remembered something.

36:05.943 --> 36:08.274
One of the cult kids, brother Zack,

36:08.399 --> 36:10.938
said he was sitting outside
the cabin all night.

36:10.992 --> 36:14.180
He said he heard a microwave
beeping from inside.

36:14.626 --> 36:16.195
What the hell are you talking about?

36:16.289 --> 36:17.541
I was in that cabin.

36:17.681 --> 36:19.117
There are a couple of lamps.

36:19.171 --> 36:20.315
There's a hot plate.

36:20.484 --> 36:23.309
- There is no microwave oven.
- What the boy heard was a beeper.

36:23.516 --> 36:26.717
It belonged to a doctor,
making a house call.

36:27.097 --> 36:29.030
Father has trouble bending down

36:29.274 --> 36:31.186
and that explains the plastic cap

36:31.203 --> 36:33.625
it was from a syringe.

36:33.679 --> 36:35.127
Father has a bad back.

36:36.083 --> 36:37.660
It's a big secret, of course.

36:37.833 --> 36:39.389
He's supposed to be the eternal one,

36:39.460 --> 36:40.873
who never gets sick.

36:41.734 --> 36:44.595
<i>He even built a secret door in the wall</i>

36:45.130 --> 36:47.419
<i>so that doctors could go in and out</i>

36:47.534 --> 36:48.786
<i>without being noticed.</i>

36:49.040 --> 36:52.170
I remember seeing a ridge in a dirt
behind his cabin.

36:52.618 --> 36:53.867
<i>We found the doctor.</i>

36:53.925 --> 36:56.542
<i>He's an osteopathic surgeon
named Wesserman.</i>

36:56.557 --> 36:59.598
<i>He goes to the ranch once a week
to give father a cortisone shot.</i>

36:59.802 --> 37:02.768
See, father has a beautiful alibi
that he can't tell anybody.

37:03.351 --> 37:06.680
Okay, so maybe it isn't this man,
this... this father person.

37:06.695 --> 37:08.370
That doesn't mean that tom was involved.

37:08.385 --> 37:12.228
Your husband swore that he saw father
at that rest stop.

37:12.243 --> 37:14.629
He picked father out of a lineup twice.

37:14.644 --> 37:17.170
Now, if father wasn't there,
that means your Husband is lying

37:17.185 --> 37:19.334
- and I like to know why.
- Okay, this is ludicrous.

37:19.349 --> 37:20.994
My Husband is a hero.

37:21.494 --> 37:24.253
He tried to save that woman.
He drove her to the hospital. Look,

37:24.601 --> 37:26.856
look. This just came in the mail.
I can prove it.

37:27.453 --> 37:28.759
It's a traffic ticket.

37:29.401 --> 37:32.352
He must have run a red light. They
have one of those automatic cameras.

37:32.372 --> 37:33.877
That's him and that's the girl.

37:35.101 --> 37:36.246
That proves it, right?

37:38.536 --> 37:39.538
Yes, ma'am.

37:40.274 --> 37:41.329
I'm afraid it does.

37:42.906 --> 37:43.926
Where's the car?

37:45.635 --> 37:47.405
This is the car you were driving?

37:47.460 --> 37:48.980
It hasn't been cleaned or anything?

37:49.340 --> 37:51.157
It's been here all week.
It's a company car.

37:51.212 --> 37:53.667
We were gonna have it cleaned
and reupholstered on monday.

37:55.777 --> 37:57.719
Oh, my god.
That poor girl.

37:58.826 --> 38:00.916
- Could I have that back, please?
- I'm afraid not.

38:01.072 --> 38:03.721
This picture is
material evidence in a homicide.

38:04.067 --> 38:07.334
In fact, I think this is the key
to the whole case.

38:07.372 --> 38:10.216
This is the motive.
This is why you killed her.

38:10.694 --> 38:12.054
Here's what I think happened.

38:12.616 --> 38:15.337
- Amanda Clark was a sex prostitute.
- A what?

38:15.861 --> 38:17.157
A sex prostitute.

38:17.410 --> 38:18.949
As opposed to what?

38:19.043 --> 38:20.200
Monk, just keep going.

38:21.490 --> 38:22.942
You were with her that night.

38:23.170 --> 38:25.181
<i>You drove through that intersection.</i>

38:25.458 --> 38:26.966
<i>You saw a camera flash.</i>

38:27.113 --> 38:29.137
You knew your picture
had just been taken.

38:29.192 --> 38:31.267
A picture of you
and her.

38:31.945 --> 38:33.983
As you said, it's a company car,

38:34.293 --> 38:36.872
which meant they'd be sending
the ticket here to the office,

38:36.926 --> 38:39.914
which meant your wife would see it,
and she would not be happy.

38:40.081 --> 38:41.323
You got that right.

38:41.925 --> 38:44.630
Somehow, you were gonna have to explain
this photograph.

38:46.187 --> 38:48.246
<i>Amanda must have told you
about her past,</i>

38:48.340 --> 38:49.931
<i>about her life in the cult.</i>

38:50.148 --> 38:52.107
<i>You realized you could kill her</i>

38:52.122 --> 38:54.300
<i>and blame it on the
whacked-out cult leader.</i>

38:55.735 --> 38:57.079
<i>He was the perfect fall guy.</i>

38:57.094 --> 38:59.343
<i>Everybody knew Amanda was afraid of him.</i>

38:59.531 --> 39:00.551
<i>That's it?</i>

39:00.734 --> 39:03.292
<i>That's just a story.
Where is your proof?</i>

39:03.990 --> 39:05.538
This isn't proof.

39:05.553 --> 39:08.125
It's not even a good picture.
It's all dark, it's all grainy.

39:08.140 --> 39:10.340
- You can't see anything.
- You can see the seatbelt.

39:11.460 --> 39:13.048
She was wearing a seatbelt.

39:13.063 --> 39:14.814
So what? She was dying.

39:14.829 --> 39:17.218
I put her in my car,
I buckled her seatbelt.

39:17.371 --> 39:20.119
You're saying this photograph
was taken on the way to the hospital

39:20.134 --> 39:21.494
after she was attacked?

39:21.621 --> 39:22.623
That's right.

39:23.441 --> 39:25.672
This woman was stabbed ten times.

39:26.044 --> 39:28.181
She was bleeding all over the seat.

39:28.226 --> 39:29.245
That's right.

39:29.805 --> 39:31.476
So this seatbelt,

39:32.211 --> 39:34.636
the seatbelt she was wearing
in this photograph,

39:35.285 --> 39:37.199
should be covered in blood, am I right?

39:47.777 --> 39:49.647
That's gonna be hard to explain.

39:51.020 --> 39:54.364
- I'd say impossible.
- Mr. Donovan, you're under arrest.

39:55.014 --> 39:56.512
Come with me, please, sir.

40:02.036 --> 40:04.877
Be careful with the bags.
You're crushing everything.

40:04.892 --> 40:07.016
- Don't squeeze too hard.
- Mr. Monk, they're heavy.

40:07.031 --> 40:08.972
Well, why didn't you make two trips?

40:14.042 --> 40:15.177
Brother Adrian!

40:15.987 --> 40:16.987
It's okay.

40:17.797 --> 40:21.166
I just wanted to thank you in person.
You cleared my name, brother.

40:21.235 --> 40:23.509
You answered my prayers,
you lifted my burden

40:23.677 --> 40:24.982
like the Angel Gabriel.

40:26.959 --> 40:28.217
I have some sherbet here.

40:28.298 --> 40:29.396
It's gonna melt.

40:29.411 --> 40:30.877
Would you like to come home?

40:33.349 --> 40:34.726
No, th, No thank you.

40:35.798 --> 40:37.103
Well, just think about it.

40:37.470 --> 40:38.650
In the meantime,

40:38.863 --> 40:41.813
if there is anything I can do for you.
Anything at all.

40:42.757 --> 40:43.928
Just say the word.

40:45.297 --> 40:46.441
There is something.

40:47.171 --> 40:50.193
- Name it. Anything.
- Your shoelace is untied.

40:53.071 --> 40:54.116
My shoelace?

40:54.682 --> 40:56.989
I'd like you to bend down
and tie your shoe.

40:57.681 --> 40:59.576
Right now, in front of your children,

41:00.042 --> 41:02.138
I want you to
bend down,

41:02.802 --> 41:04.948
and tie your shoe.
Can you do that for me?

41:07.523 --> 41:09.276
Maybe a little cortisone shot

41:09.652 --> 41:12.815
would help. Or we could call
dr. Wesserman, right?

41:13.185 --> 41:15.648
Dr. Seth Wesserman of Sausalito.

41:15.938 --> 41:17.834
He's been treating father for years.

41:18.779 --> 41:19.780
Call him.

41:20.450 --> 41:21.601
The more you know,

41:21.819 --> 41:23.133
the less you don't know.

41:24.188 --> 41:25.297
Isn't that right?

41:28.093 --> 41:29.246
So long, pops.

41:31.024 --> 41:33.802
- We sure showed him.
- We sure did. You did good, boss.

41:33.862 --> 41:34.882
Oh, my god!

41:34.929 --> 41:36.120
Did you stop that check?

41:36.135 --> 41:37.574
Yeah, I already called the bank.

41:39.759 --> 41:40.978
We sure showed him?

41:40.993 --> 41:44.247
We sure did. You did good.
You did really, really good.
