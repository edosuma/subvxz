00:01.730 --> 00:05.497
Okay, yes, I'll tell
Khadijah you called.

00:05.564 --> 00:07.797
Hey, so how do you like
Montenegro?

00:07.864 --> 00:11.397
Well, give my regards
to the king.

00:11.464 --> 00:15.697
Oh! Uh...then give my regards
to the rebel leader.

00:15.764 --> 00:17.864
Oh, okay. Alright, bye.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.197
Hey, was that Scooter?

00:19.264 --> 00:21.730
Hmm. You just missed him, girl.

00:21.797 --> 00:23.864
Again? Damn.

00:23.930 --> 00:25.897
So sick of him bein' on tour.

00:25.964 --> 00:27.330
Did he leave a number?

00:27.397 --> 00:29.064
Uh‐uh. He just landed
in Montenegro.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.864
But he said the concert went
great and he'll call you

00:31.930 --> 00:33.264
when he gets to Vienna.

00:33.330 --> 00:37.797
Oh and he haid "Ich liebe dich."
which means I love you.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.130
Bad enough I can't hear
it from him

00:41.197 --> 00:44.164
I gotta hear
it with your phony accent.

00:44.230 --> 00:47.197
So, how did he sound?
Did he sound cute?

00:47.264 --> 00:48.230
Adorable.

00:48.297 --> 00:50.597
Like he had on tight jeans?

00:52.630 --> 00:56.930
And no drawers.

00:56.997 --> 01:00.064
Well, did he sound like
you know, like he miss me?

01:00.130 --> 01:03.270
Khadijah, in the whole ten
seconds that we spoke

01:03.337 --> 01:08.937
I sensed nothing but utter
lonliness and total despair.

01:09.003 --> 01:12.704
Aw, puss‐guddy‐poody.

01:12.770 --> 01:15.370
Well, that's what he get
for leavin' me.

01:51.870 --> 01:55.070
Oh, you and Scooter will learn
how to deal with it.

01:55.137 --> 01:57.704
Buddy and I are apart
for months of the time

01:57.770 --> 01:59.470
but every time
I vist Minneapolis

01:59.537 --> 02:00.810
we're still closer than ever.

02:00.877 --> 02:02.610
Now I know what
you're gonna say.

02:02.677 --> 02:05.677
Buddy is a poodle.

02:05.744 --> 02:09.577
No. I was gonna say
Synclaire, shut up.

02:09.644 --> 02:11.610
Buddy would never tell me
to shut up.

02:11.677 --> 02:13.177
That's why we're still so close.

02:13.244 --> 02:15.477
'Course Buddy is a dog
and dogs can't talk

02:15.544 --> 02:18.410
but we communicate
on a whole other level.

02:18.477 --> 02:20.710
I really never had a long
distance relationship before

02:20.777 --> 02:23.577
but I did hook‐up with this guy
on the plane once.

02:23.644 --> 02:27.644
Got in trouble when he broke the
smoke detector with his foot.

02:28.910 --> 02:30.977
What do your random exploits

02:31.044 --> 02:32.510
have to do
with Khadijah's problem?

02:32.577 --> 02:35.844
You wanna stay on the subject
or you wanna hear a good story?

02:39.577 --> 02:41.544
So, what happened next?

02:41.610 --> 02:43.577
He got dressed.
Went back to the cockpit.

02:43.644 --> 02:45.910
Oh my God!

02:45.977 --> 02:47.077
Give me that.

02:47.977 --> 02:49.544
Hey, wassup? Wassup?

02:49.610 --> 02:51.877
Khadijah, you got a history book
on Kenya, yeah?

02:51.944 --> 02:53.244
Yeah, right in the shelf.

02:53.310 --> 02:55.810
Right between
"La Toya, my story"

02:55.877 --> 02:58.177
and "Wynona Judd, my story."

03:00.644 --> 03:03.350
Yeah, Kyle's puttin' finishin'
touches on the plan that would

03:03.417 --> 03:07.017
not only benefit himself but the
rest of the world as we know it.

03:07.084 --> 03:10.884
He's gonna be like a young,
black dreadlock wearin' Gandhi.

03:13.417 --> 03:15.350
Ha ha ha. Thank you, Overton.

03:15.417 --> 03:18.117
I'm makin' my first presentation
to the partners tomorrow.

03:18.184 --> 03:20.417
So lettin' your boss
whoop your behind at tennis

03:20.484 --> 03:22.617
really paid off, huh?

03:22.684 --> 03:24.150
Yeah, but no,
they're really excited

03:24.217 --> 03:26.184
about my idea for
an African Mutual Fund.

03:26.250 --> 03:27.984
The continent has been
pretty much ignored

03:28.050 --> 03:29.250
by the financial community

03:29.317 --> 03:32.117
and I'm going to be the man
to capitalize on it.

03:32.184 --> 03:36.317
So this means you'll be movin'
to Africa soon, huh?

03:36.384 --> 03:41.117
Now there's a long distance
relationship that could work.

03:41.184 --> 03:43.117
Sorry, Jane Pittman.

03:47.417 --> 03:49.850
I'm gonna stay right here
in New York, alright?

03:49.917 --> 03:52.084
And get promoted in the process.

03:52.150 --> 03:54.717
This is gonna be my ticket
to the next level.

03:54.784 --> 03:58.550
Oh, please, can't that ticket
take you to Africa?

03:58.617 --> 04:02.057
When I do get promoted I'll take
you all to the Rainbow Room.

04:02.124 --> 04:03.257
‐ What?
‐ Yes!

04:03.324 --> 04:05.490
Oh except for you.

04:05.557 --> 04:07.624
Come on, Kyle,
I was just kiddin'.

04:07.690 --> 04:11.124
Ah. Aww. Good luck
at the big meetin', huh.

04:12.324 --> 04:13.724
Mm‐mm‐mwah.

04:13.790 --> 04:15.224
Ugh!

04:20.290 --> 04:21.824
(Kyle)
'Okay, let's see, let's see.'

04:21.890 --> 04:25.024
Um, Greetings and felicitations,
gentlemen.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.624
No, no, this is too stiff,
too stiff.

04:27.690 --> 04:28.924
Y'all wassup?

04:28.990 --> 04:31.457
[indistinct chattering]

04:32.190 --> 04:33.590
Good morning, Kyle.

04:33.657 --> 04:36.223
Running a little late, Kyle.
You got six minutes.

04:36.290 --> 04:37.523
Well, I'll only need
five‐and‐a‐half.

04:37.590 --> 04:40.257
We can spend the last
30 seconds schmoozing.

04:40.324 --> 04:41.857
[laughing]

04:44.590 --> 04:47.290
Okay. I'll use all six minutes.

04:47.357 --> 04:49.824
Gentlemen, here's a complete
outline for my proposal.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.157
Now, knowing that the firm

04:51.224 --> 04:53.190
is always looking to develop
emerging markets.

04:53.257 --> 04:57.524
My research shows that the next
financial frontier is Africa.

04:57.590 --> 05:01.264
By the way, Kyle, that's
a handome laser pointer.

05:01.330 --> 05:04.930
Ow, thanks.
Sharper image. $129.95.

05:07.730 --> 05:09.830
Um, but as I was saying

05:09.897 --> 05:12.230
Africa is a continent
poised for growth.

05:12.297 --> 05:15.797
We're looking at a economic
expansion rate of over 30 to 40%

05:15.864 --> 05:17.097
within the next 12 months.

05:17.164 --> 05:18.630
How can we assure our investors

05:18.697 --> 05:20.664
that Africa
is a safe and stable market?

05:20.730 --> 05:22.164
Well, it's about potential,
Lawrence

05:22.230 --> 05:24.064
I mean with Nelson Mandela
in office

05:24.130 --> 05:25.864
the continent
is more stable than ever.

05:25.930 --> 05:28.430
And remember our perception
of Latin America in the '80s.

05:28.497 --> 05:30.230
And you know
how much this firm

05:30.297 --> 05:31.764
makes of Latin America
investments today.

05:31.830 --> 05:32.897
I know.

05:32.964 --> 05:34.697
And why do you think
the cafeteria

05:34.764 --> 05:37.030
is having a salute
to Costa Rica?

05:37.097 --> 05:40.464
Exactly. And the African fund
can be just as profitable.

05:40.530 --> 05:41.997
Assuming we have
a Funds Manager

05:42.064 --> 05:43.930
with great expertise
and experience.

05:43.997 --> 05:45.097
I suggest myself.

05:45.164 --> 05:47.664
That's a bit greedy, Kyle.

05:49.164 --> 05:50.730
Good for you.

05:52.964 --> 05:55.297
Well, you gentlemen
were my role models.

05:55.364 --> 05:56.830
Well, on that note..

05:56.897 --> 05:59.397
So, um, when can I expect
to hear a decision?

05:59.464 --> 06:01.237
When we tell you.

06:02.270 --> 06:03.304
Fair enough.

06:03.370 --> 06:06.170
Ah, good job, Kyle.
Very creative.

06:06.237 --> 06:07.470
Better get going, gentlemen.

06:07.537 --> 06:10.470
We have lunch with those
Japanese investors again.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.404
You know what that means.

06:12.470 --> 06:15.170
Burgers and fries
and another matinee of "Cats".

06:18.337 --> 06:19.970
Woo!

06:25.404 --> 06:27.337
[snoring]

06:37.937 --> 06:39.337
Br‐r‐ring!

06:39.404 --> 06:41.004
Scooter?

06:41.704 --> 06:43.804
[Maxine laughing]

06:46.237 --> 06:47.804
Hey!

06:47.870 --> 06:50.937
I see you stayed up all night,
waiting for Scooter to call.

06:51.004 --> 06:53.670
I did not.
I stayed up till two.

06:54.470 --> 06:56.537
I got up at four.

06:56.604 --> 06:59.837
But between two and four
I slept like a rock.

06:59.904 --> 07:01.944
What time was he
supposed to call?

07:02.010 --> 07:03.310
This morning.

07:03.377 --> 07:05.010
Tomorrow, his time.

07:05.077 --> 07:07.944
Yesterday evening,
my time, today.

07:08.777 --> 07:10.777
Khadijah, go to bed.

07:10.844 --> 07:11.777
I can't.

07:11.844 --> 07:14.077
I don't wanna miss
Scooter's call.

07:14.144 --> 07:17.044
Khadijah, Scooter called
last night around 2:30

07:17.110 --> 07:19.844
'I was gonna wake you but you
were sleeping so soundly.'

07:19.910 --> 07:22.877
Just like a little angel.

07:22.944 --> 07:25.444
Did you talk to him?
What did he say?

07:25.510 --> 07:27.177
Oh, we had a lovely chat.

07:27.244 --> 07:29.677
The record company
charted a private boat

07:29.744 --> 07:33.044
and Scooter and the ladies from
the band cruised the river Seine

07:33.110 --> 07:36.644
and then, they danced the night
away at a private party

07:36.710 --> 07:39.210
atop the Eiffel Tower.

07:39.277 --> 07:40.977
[whimpering]

07:41.044 --> 07:43.777
I could tell
he was having no fun at all

07:43.844 --> 07:44.844
since you weren't there.

07:44.910 --> 07:45.944
[phone ringing]

07:47.510 --> 07:48.777
Hello?

07:48.844 --> 07:50.444
‐ What?
‐ Is that Scooter?

07:50.510 --> 07:52.044
I‐I can't understand you.

07:52.110 --> 07:53.044
Is that Scooter?

07:53.110 --> 07:56.910
No, it's my grandmother.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.550
Nana, put your teeth in, honey.

08:01.450 --> 08:04.817
Oh, calm down, shortie.
You gon' hyper‐ventilate again

08:04.884 --> 08:07.550
and we're all out of paper bags.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.084
Overton, I don't get it.

08:09.150 --> 08:11.317
They were obviously impressed
with my proposal, right?

08:11.384 --> 08:14.650
And yesterday Jeffrey went out
of his way to say hello to me

08:14.717 --> 08:15.917
at the water cooler.

08:15.984 --> 08:18.484
You know, I don't understand
why I haven't heard anything

08:18.550 --> 08:20.650
about this promotion yet.

08:20.717 --> 08:24.484
Do people really stand
by the water cooler?

08:24.550 --> 08:28.084
Man, you miss so much
when you work for yourself.

08:28.150 --> 08:29.250
Good morning.

08:29.317 --> 08:31.784
Yeah, what's good about it?

08:31.850 --> 08:33.083
Full fur.

08:33.150 --> 08:36.049
It's warm, it's chic
and politically correct.

08:38.984 --> 08:41.116
Kyle, did you get
that big promotion?

08:41.183 --> 08:43.984
No. It's been three days
I have heard nothing about it.

08:44.049 --> 08:45.417
It's eatin' me up inside.

08:45.484 --> 08:46.784
Well, <i>bon apetit.</i>

08:46.850 --> 08:48.150
[slurping]

08:55.050 --> 08:57.350
Look, don't worry, Kyle.

08:57.417 --> 09:00.290
Good things come
to those who wait.

09:00.357 --> 09:04.557
Unless, of course
you're on death row.

09:04.624 --> 09:05.590
Good luck.

09:06.890 --> 09:09.224
You know, Overton,
I can't take this anymore, man.

09:09.290 --> 09:10.824
Then don't.

09:10.890 --> 09:14.190
March up to one of those
partners and demand a answer.

09:14.257 --> 09:17.890
Overton, you do not march up
to a partner and make demands.

09:17.957 --> 09:20.190
You compliment them
on their business accumen.

09:20.257 --> 09:22.357
You point out their
fine taste in ties

09:22.424 --> 09:26.124
while you read something
on their desk upside down.

09:26.190 --> 09:28.224
There's gotta be somebody down
at the firm

09:28.290 --> 09:30.190
you can ask for advice.

09:30.257 --> 09:31.490
What about
that brother Lawrence?

09:31.557 --> 09:32.757
We played poker with him.

09:32.824 --> 09:36.557
That Lawrence is an egotistical,
self‐centered jackass.

09:36.624 --> 09:39.690
But he's a jackass
you got access to.

09:43.657 --> 09:45.457
I wonder if he's free for lunch.

09:45.524 --> 09:46.457
Mm‐hmm.

09:48.257 --> 09:51.457
Your hardwork has brought
the firm some good returns.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.790
And yeilded
some very satisfying numbers.

09:54.857 --> 09:56.957
As a result,
our team is now third

09:57.024 --> 09:58.790
in the Wall Street
Basketball League.

09:58.857 --> 10:00.630
[cheering]

10:00.697 --> 10:03.797
Yes. Yes, keep it up.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.330
‐ Hey, Lawrence.
‐ Hey, how you doing?

10:05.397 --> 10:07.764
Seems you have a good
basketball team this year.

10:07.830 --> 10:10.297
They played like
a bunch of girls.

10:10.364 --> 10:12.030
What can I do for you?

10:12.097 --> 10:13.497
Well, I wanted to talk.

10:13.564 --> 10:16.830
Uh..Hey that's one heck
of a tie.

10:17.497 --> 10:18.864
Thank you.

10:20.464 --> 10:22.764
Look, I want to ask you
for some advice.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.030
Sure, what's the problem?

10:24.097 --> 10:26.964
Well, it seemed to me
that my presentation went well.

10:27.030 --> 10:28.997
I know there's
a lot of red tape

10:29.064 --> 10:31.297
but it's been three days.
I haven't heard anything.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.764
Yeah, it can be frustrating.

10:32.830 --> 10:35.897
I remember when I was looking
at the process from your side.

10:35.964 --> 10:38.297
Ah‐ha.

10:38.364 --> 10:41.197
Okay. What did you think
of my proposal?

10:41.264 --> 10:43.097
It was very impressive.

10:43.164 --> 10:46.197
But you should be aware
there is one stumbling block.

10:46.264 --> 10:47.197
What?

10:47.264 --> 10:49.197
It's your appearance.

10:49.264 --> 10:51.864
[giggling]

10:51.930 --> 10:54.764
But this jacket is Armani,
this vest is Versace

10:54.830 --> 11:00.170
these pants are Cerruti,
I mean I could go on.

11:00.237 --> 11:03.370
Kyle, no. It's not your clothes.
It's your hair.

11:04.304 --> 11:06.270
‐ My hair?
‐ 'Yes.'

11:06.337 --> 11:09.404
What does that have to do with
me becoming Funds Manager?

11:09.470 --> 11:12.770
Well, we don't think
it's corporate enough.

11:15.237 --> 11:17.737
It has never been
a problem before.

11:17.804 --> 11:19.570
Kyle, you don't get promoted
around here

11:19.637 --> 11:21.004
by going against the grain.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.970
Look, if this
Africa project goes through

11:23.037 --> 11:24.237
you'll be representing
this company

11:24.304 --> 11:25.770
to a much higher level
clientele.

11:25.837 --> 11:28.270
'And then your appearance
becomes much more important.'

11:28.337 --> 11:31.604
So, take my advice..

11:31.670 --> 11:33.237
...change the hair.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.570
[theme music]

11:46.637 --> 11:49.004
[audience laughing]

11:56.670 --> 12:00.772
Kyle, come on, honey. I think
you made the right choice.

12:00.839 --> 12:04.439
It's conservative
yet stylish.

12:04.505 --> 12:07.239
It's just
not me, alright.

12:07.305 --> 12:09.872
[audience applauding]

12:11.205 --> 12:14.539
Well, that's the great
thing about wearing wigs.

12:14.605 --> 12:17.839
I mean, you can be who
ever they want on the outside

12:17.905 --> 12:20.505
but underneath
the nylon, the pins

12:20.572 --> 12:23.239
and the practical
no‐sweat band, you're you.

12:25.405 --> 12:28.372
Hey how about somethin' old
that somethin' new again, huh?

12:28.439 --> 12:31.005
The shag. Come on,
just try it, come on.

12:31.072 --> 12:33.105
For you,
for you. Alright, alright..

12:34.705 --> 12:36.805
[audience laughing]

12:39.939 --> 12:42.005
[gasping]

12:43.439 --> 12:45.339
Don't even try.
It is too late.

12:45.405 --> 12:48.639
We saw you sitting there looking
like a black David Cassidy.

12:50.039 --> 12:52.172
Guys, Kyle
is in a career crisis.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.239
So you can either stay here
and help or you can leave.

12:55.305 --> 12:58.972
Can we just stay
here and laugh at him?

12:59.039 --> 13:01.412
[audience laughing]

13:04.845 --> 13:08.312
Check it out, y'all.
Receding hairline.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.445
[all laughing]

13:12.779 --> 13:14.679
‐ Would you give me that?
‐ 'Hmm.'

13:14.745 --> 13:17.145
What the hell
is goin' on here?

13:17.212 --> 13:19.945
It seems that the only
way that I will be getting

13:20.012 --> 13:22.179
my promotion is if
I change my hairstyle

13:22.245 --> 13:24.545
to something
more corporate.

13:24.612 --> 13:25.779
Those bastards!

13:25.845 --> 13:27.812
All those good
reasons to hold you back

13:27.879 --> 13:31.279
and they pick
something unfair like this.

13:31.345 --> 13:34.312
My boss tried to get me
to change my hair once.

13:34.379 --> 13:36.345
You're the one that
got your hair caught

13:36.412 --> 13:38.645
in the paper shredder
two days in a row.

13:38.712 --> 13:41.679
I mean, I merely
suggested a trim.

13:41.745 --> 13:45.379
Still think I could
have gotten workman's comp.

13:45.445 --> 13:48.579
Kyle, you must know that when
you work in the corporate world

13:48.645 --> 13:51.445
sometimes you have
to conform to get ahead.

13:51.512 --> 13:53.479
So you would change
your hairstyle, huh?

13:53.545 --> 13:56.412
Hell, no. That's why I went
into business for myself.

13:56.479 --> 13:57.879
I'm no one's puppet.

13:59.212 --> 14:00.719
We all have to compromise
sometimes.

14:00.785 --> 14:04.685
And if changing your
hair means helping Africa

14:04.752 --> 14:07.985
and gettin' paid,
I say, snip snip.

14:09.652 --> 14:12.585
Regine makes
a cogent point.

14:12.652 --> 14:16.085
Why not remove the moral
dilemma altogether?

14:16.152 --> 14:19.185
Do like I did.
Go all natural.

14:20.685 --> 14:24.352
See, you'll save a ton
of money on that jojoba shampoo.

14:24.419 --> 14:27.019
Not only that,
the ladies love it.

14:29.952 --> 14:34.285
It accentuates his sexy ears
and brings out his eyebrows.

14:36.052 --> 14:38.319
But my dreads are an
expression of my culture.

14:38.385 --> 14:40.885
If I change my hair
wouldn't that be sellin' out?

14:40.952 --> 14:42.685
Kyle, you're
a stock broker.

14:44.952 --> 14:47.585
You're a sellout,
either way.

14:51.252 --> 14:54.619
Kyle, maybe you should try
working within the system.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.519
Just till you get
into a position of power.

14:57.585 --> 15:00.492
And then you can tell
else how to wear their hair.

15:04.225 --> 15:06.725
You know, I have
worked and come too far

15:06.792 --> 15:10.959
to let something like
my hair hold me back now.

15:11.025 --> 15:14.592
Besides, maybe
it is time for a change.

15:14.659 --> 15:17.392
Overton, who's this miracle
barber you've been telling me?

15:17.459 --> 15:20.759
Alright. You go down
to Shane's and ask for Moe.

15:20.825 --> 15:22.092
He's the best there.

15:22.159 --> 15:25.459
He's the little guy
about four‐foot three.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.925
But don't worry 'cause
the chair's in a pit.

15:29.792 --> 15:32.692
[audience laughing]

15:32.759 --> 15:35.559
Certainly the fund would require
an expert hand to manage it.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.992
That's why I suggest
myself as funds manager.

15:38.059 --> 15:40.659
Kyle, that's an
impressive presentation.

15:40.725 --> 15:45.059
However, there is one little
adjustment you can make.

15:45.125 --> 15:46.892
Um, anything.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.425
The tie.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.232
I‐I like it.

16:03.699 --> 16:06.132
Of course
the suit must go.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.365
Hey...I'm a team player.

16:10.932 --> 16:13.999
Nice fabric,
and...the shoes work.

16:15.632 --> 16:16.999
Something's missing.

16:19.099 --> 16:20.499
I don't know about this.

16:20.565 --> 16:21.832
Hey, Kyle.

16:21.899 --> 16:25.332
Overton, man ,
I'm so glad to see...you.

16:25.399 --> 16:27.899
Meet Moe, the barber.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.932
Snip, snip.
Snip, snip.

16:36.432 --> 16:38.199
Um, this concludes
my presentation.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.932
Kyle! It's time
to perform for the queen.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.832
The, the queen?

16:42.899 --> 16:44.399
Your majesty.

16:44.465 --> 16:46.432
[audience laughing]

16:47.399 --> 16:48.832
Make me laugh!

16:48.899 --> 16:51.899
[screaming]

16:55.599 --> 16:57.032
Ooh.

16:58.965 --> 17:03.872
Okay, Tokyo.
Budapest.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.839
Regine. I just don't
think I can pull it off.

17:09.005 --> 17:11.605
No, I think
it looks adorable.

17:11.672 --> 17:14.372
No, really.
I can't pull it off.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.204
Khadijah, scooter
just called us from London.

17:20.271 --> 17:23.271
Said he was trying to reach you,
but your phone's been busy.

17:23.339 --> 17:25.905
Max, didn't you hear
that phone beep?

17:25.972 --> 17:28.805
Michael, I gotta go.
Someone needs to use the phone.

17:28.872 --> 17:31.872
Arthur, I gotta go.
Someone needs to use the phone.

17:31.939 --> 17:34.172
Why you go tie up
both lines like that?

17:34.239 --> 17:37.805
Only one of them
was long distance.

17:37.872 --> 17:39.105
Did he
leave a number?

17:39.172 --> 17:40.905
He's just
checked out of the hotel

17:40.972 --> 17:43.205
and about to catch
a ferry over to Ireland.

17:43.272 --> 17:44.705
He did
leave a message.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.572
He said that he's thinkin'
of you all the time.

17:47.639 --> 17:50.905
The photo shoot went well
and that he and the girls

17:50.972 --> 17:53.539
met the queen of England
and danced the night away

17:53.605 --> 17:56.205
at Buckingham palace.

17:56.272 --> 17:59.545
Isn't he just havin'
a merry old cheerio time?

17:59.612 --> 18:02.879
Bloody twit!

18:02.945 --> 18:05.979
Girl, I know Scooter's workin'.
But it also sounds like

18:06.045 --> 18:09.145
he's livin' the life while
you're living by the phone.

18:09.212 --> 18:11.879
Mmm, you're missin' sleep,
you don't go out at nights.

18:11.945 --> 18:16.712
Haven't done laundry in weeks.
I'm runnin' out of clothes.

18:16.779 --> 18:18.912
Look, Scooter
is just doing his job.

18:18.979 --> 18:22.245
Do you think it's easy taking
care of four beautiful women?

18:22.312 --> 18:25.745
Escorting them
to all those clubs.

18:25.812 --> 18:29.012
Making sure their
skirts are short enough.

18:29.079 --> 18:33.912
Scheduling
their bikini waxes.

18:33.979 --> 18:36.679
Damn! I need a life
and this is not it.

18:36.745 --> 18:40.212
I mean, I'm gonna stop sittin'
and worryin' about that phone.

18:40.279 --> 18:43.345
And if Scooter catches me,
he just catches me.

18:43.412 --> 18:45.712
That's right.
Good.

18:45.779 --> 18:48.545
Remember, I like my socks
rolled from the open part down

18:48.612 --> 18:51.612
to the toe not the other way
like you've been doing it.

19:00.519 --> 19:02.652
How long is Kyle
gonna keep us waiting.

19:02.719 --> 19:05.952
First he calls a special
meeting and then he's late.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.385
He's learning.

19:10.552 --> 19:12.019
Glad you
all could make it.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.485
This had better be good.

19:13.552 --> 19:16.219
What can we
do for you, Kyle?

19:16.285 --> 19:20.452
Actually this is about
what I cannot do for you.

19:20.519 --> 19:24.085
Um...when I joined this
firm about three years ago.

19:24.152 --> 19:26.652
I believed it to be
a place where person advanced

19:26.719 --> 19:29.185
because of his
or her ability.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.952
But I've come to realize
that this firm values

19:32.019 --> 19:34.985
'the superficial
over the substantial.'

19:35.052 --> 19:38.219
But I cannot violate
my personal integrity.

19:38.285 --> 19:43.852
My hair is not just for fashion.
It's part of my heritage.

19:43.919 --> 19:46.552
It is a statement of pride.

19:47.819 --> 19:50.719
[audience applauding]

19:50.785 --> 19:54.219
A statement, by the way which
could show our clients

19:54.285 --> 19:56.252
that this firm is not
progressive when investing

19:56.319 --> 20:01.025
it's money, but also progressive
when investing in it's people.

20:01.092 --> 20:04.492
So gentlemen, whether you
decide to promote me or not..

20:04.559 --> 20:08.092
...I will not
change my hair.

20:08.159 --> 20:10.792
[audience applauding]

20:15.125 --> 20:18.825
Okay.

20:18.892 --> 20:20.392
‐ That's it?
‐ Kyle.

20:20.459 --> 20:22.425
Uh, we resolved
the hair issue this morning.

20:22.492 --> 20:24.459
When Lawrence brought
it up we were concerned.

20:24.525 --> 20:26.592
After some discussion
we came to the conclusion

20:26.659 --> 20:28.492
that you have just
so eloquently stated.

20:28.559 --> 20:31.859
If we wanted to bring it up
to you Kyle, we would have.

20:33.092 --> 20:34.925
How did you
hear about it, anyway?

20:37.725 --> 20:39.392
Lawrence.

20:39.459 --> 20:43.425
You know I feel it's not in
keeping with the company image.

20:43.492 --> 20:47.025
You really
need to loosen up.

20:47.092 --> 20:49.625
We were gonna save this
for the board meetin', Kyle.

20:49.692 --> 20:51.959
But, uh, we're gonna go
ahead with the project

20:52.025 --> 20:53.925
and promote you
the funds manager.

20:57.625 --> 20:58.859
Thank you, sir.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.499
Unless you want to take
a stand about your goatee

21:01.565 --> 21:02.765
I guess we're
about done.

21:02.832 --> 21:04.232
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Thank you very much.

21:04.299 --> 21:06.265
‐ Well done.
‐ Thank you.

21:07.532 --> 21:10.299
Uh, Kyle.
No hard feelings, huh.

21:11.765 --> 21:13.599
No feelings
at all, man.

21:14.832 --> 21:16.832
Look, I was just
trying to help.

21:19.632 --> 21:21.365
You see,
that's the sad part.

21:22.199 --> 21:23.865
You actually believe that.

21:29.432 --> 21:30.532
Yeah.

21:31.865 --> 21:33.165
I do.

21:37.765 --> 21:39.132
[theme music]

21:39.199 --> 21:41.932
[whistling]

21:44.465 --> 21:47.365
[audience laughing]

21:47.432 --> 21:49.832
Overton,
how you doin'?

21:49.899 --> 21:53.099
Ah, doin' pretty good, man.
How about yourself?

21:53.165 --> 21:55.099
I'm doin' alright.
How's your girl, Synclaire?

21:55.165 --> 21:59.132
Oh, she's fine, man.

21:59.199 --> 22:01.439
We're still kind of,
you know taking it easy.

22:01.505 --> 22:03.072
We're gonna
take our time.

22:03.139 --> 22:06.572
Oh, I love that
Khadijah girl.

22:06.639 --> 22:13.039
‐ You and Khadijah.
‐ Man, that would be something.

22:13.105 --> 22:16.939
The possibilities
are endless, Moe, my man.

22:17.005 --> 22:20.072
Ha? Don't laugh while you
cut my hair though. Alright.

22:21.926 --> 22:22.993
<i>(female #1)</i>
<i>Whoo‐hoo!</i>

22:23.059 --> 22:23.993
[woman chuckles]
