WEBVTT

00:04.506 --> 00:06.023
So?
No.

00:06.025 --> 00:07.758
No. You-You were in.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.510
I said, "Have you met Ted"
and everything.

00:09.512 --> 00:11.128
How could that not work?
I don't know,

00:11.130 --> 00:13.130
we introduced ourselves,
I bought her a drink,

00:13.132 --> 00:14.348
told her I loved her...

00:14.350 --> 00:16.050
What?
I'm kidding.

00:16.052 --> 00:20.020
Hold on, Roxanne-- if that
really is your name.

00:20.022 --> 00:21.856
It's not. It's Robin.

00:21.858 --> 00:24.358
You played "Have You Met Ted"
without me?

00:24.360 --> 00:26.727
In <i>my</i> bar with <i>my</i> Ted?

00:26.729 --> 00:31.065
Maybe stealing a bro's wingman
is okay back in...

00:31.067 --> 00:34.434
I'm sorry, what's the name of
this third world banana republic

00:34.436 --> 00:35.953
you claim to be from?

00:35.955 --> 00:38.605
Canada.

00:38.607 --> 00:41.075
I have literally
never heard of that place.

00:41.077 --> 00:42.743
When'd you move
here, anyway?

00:42.745 --> 00:43.744
Two months ago.

00:43.746 --> 00:44.912
How do you like it?
Honestly,

00:44.914 --> 00:46.580
it-it's been
a little tough.

00:46.582 --> 00:49.467
I moved here for this on-air
reporter job at Metro News 1

00:49.469 --> 00:51.418
thinking it was gonna
be my big break,

00:51.420 --> 00:52.419
only to find out

00:52.421 --> 00:54.121
that our viewership
mostly consists

00:54.123 --> 00:55.306
of DMV waiting rooms

00:55.308 --> 00:57.508
and people plugging in their
TV for the first time.

00:58.460 --> 01:01.295
To top it all off,
I have no friends.

01:02.097 --> 01:04.598
Um... wrong.

01:04.599 --> 01:05.850
You have four friends
right here.

01:05.852 --> 01:08.135
Right, guys?
Uh, yeah.

01:08.137 --> 01:09.937
You're totally in our gang,
now. And once you're in,

01:09.939 --> 01:11.272
you're in for life, right?

01:11.274 --> 01:13.073
She's in.
Oh. All right.

01:13.075 --> 01:14.775
She's in.
Welcome.

01:14.777 --> 01:16.744
Well, if I'm in, I should
get the next round.

01:16.746 --> 01:18.195
Whoa, whoa,
Ooh,

01:18.197 --> 01:19.914
I like this girl.
ho, ho.

01:20.916 --> 01:23.117
I'm serious, I
like this girl.

01:23.119 --> 01:25.819
And we need some estrogen
up in this bitch.

01:25.821 --> 01:28.622
All we ever talk about
is Scotch and sports.

01:28.624 --> 01:30.657
Five Glen McKennas,
21 years, neat.

01:30.659 --> 01:32.710
And switch it
to the hockey game, 'cause

01:32.712 --> 01:35.095
my Canucks are gonna
bury the Bruins, yo.

01:35.097 --> 01:37.047
So here's the deal
with the deal.

01:37.049 --> 01:38.498
Robin's my new
best friend--

01:38.500 --> 01:39.967
nobody bangs her.

01:39.969 --> 01:40.935
Hey, hey,

01:40.937 --> 01:42.219
hey, she only rejected me

01:42.221 --> 01:44.438
three times,
she's still very much in play.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.390
I'm serious.

01:46.392 --> 01:49.860
There's only one way I'd let
either of you have sex with her.

01:49.862 --> 01:52.780
Not that. It's never that.

01:53.648 --> 01:54.732
I really want this girl

01:54.734 --> 01:56.400
to stay a part
of our lives.

01:56.402 --> 01:59.904
So the only way you're allowed
to hook up with her...

01:59.906 --> 02:02.522
is if you marry her.

02:02.524 --> 02:04.959
Too rich for my blood.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.362
That son of a bitch did it.

02:08.364 --> 02:10.663
He really did.

02:10.666 --> 02:12.750
So you're moving
to Chicago tomorrow, huh?

02:12.752 --> 02:14.752
How do you feel?

02:14.754 --> 02:16.637
Uh, I'm looking forward to it.

02:16.639 --> 02:18.005
The job's amazing.

02:18.007 --> 02:19.539
I got a great apartment
lined up.

02:19.541 --> 02:21.809
You know, it's...

02:21.811 --> 02:23.510
It's exciting.

02:23.512 --> 02:25.545
Onwards and upwar...

02:50.590 --> 02:54.174
Hey! Bass player.

02:54.176 --> 02:56.910
It's me. The guy from
the drug store with the diapers

02:56.912 --> 02:58.545
that hit on you,
then we went outside

02:58.547 --> 03:01.548
and had a deep, emotional
talk on a bus bench.

03:01.550 --> 03:03.917
I ...I-I'm gonna be really
surprised if I have to be

03:03.919 --> 03:05.185
more specific than that.

03:05.187 --> 03:07.021
Remember when you

03:07.023 --> 03:08.422
told me to stop
messing around

03:08.424 --> 03:09.589
and go get the girl?

03:09.591 --> 03:12.276
Well, check it. I got her.

03:13.980 --> 03:16.864
What about you?
You still dating that guy?

03:24.656 --> 03:26.540
Grape Scotch

03:26.542 --> 03:28.659
Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted.

03:28.661 --> 03:30.127
Right here, right here,
Yeah,

03:30.129 --> 03:31.712
I-I see you, Barney.
right here, right here.

03:31.714 --> 03:33.163
Good, great. Then it's
time to play a little game

03:33.165 --> 03:34.381
I like to call Have...
Yeah,

03:34.383 --> 03:36.300
Barney, I...
No, no.

03:36.302 --> 03:38.302
You are not getting out
of Have You Met Ted.

03:38.304 --> 03:39.553
There's a girl
that you have to meet.

03:39.555 --> 03:41.839
She is perfect for you.
And <i>has...</i>

03:41.841 --> 03:43.474
she met you?
No, she <i>has...</i> not.

03:43.476 --> 03:45.726
Think of all the sex
you're gonna <i>ha..</i>

03:45.728 --> 03:47.094
Barney.

03:48.129 --> 03:49.629
I ha... I have to go.

03:49.631 --> 03:51.631
What, now?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.602
Yeah.

03:58.907 --> 04:00.407
Y...

04:00.409 --> 04:02.576
W-We have to do this outside.

04:09.868 --> 04:11.485
Robin.

04:12.370 --> 04:14.171
It's been a major pleasure.

04:14.173 --> 04:16.457
Major Pleasure.
Major Pleasure.

04:16.459 --> 04:18.658
Come here.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.047
Congratulations.

04:23.049 --> 04:24.765
Thank you.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.974
Oh, God, no, this is too real.

04:33.976 --> 04:37.077
I can't handle this,
Marshall's next.

04:37.079 --> 04:39.179
Marshall.

04:40.899 --> 04:43.734
Good luck out there
in Chicago.

04:43.736 --> 04:46.120
I'm gonna be kind of jealous
of you, getting to have

04:46.122 --> 04:48.622
Gazzola's pizza
whenever you want.

04:48.624 --> 04:49.823
You're gonna be in Rome.

04:49.825 --> 04:52.793
Yeah. I guess.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.300
I just...

05:00.302 --> 05:03.470
I feel like a hug isn't enough.

05:03.472 --> 05:05.389
E.T. good-bye?

05:09.144 --> 05:12.896
I'll be right...

05:12.898 --> 05:15.715
here.

05:15.717 --> 05:17.851
Okay, it helped,
but that was really creepy.

05:17.853 --> 05:20.070
I don't want to see you for awhile.

05:22.273 --> 05:24.441
Barney.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.727
Mm.

05:29.614 --> 05:31.131
We licked the Liberty Bell.

05:31.133 --> 05:32.499
We did?

05:32.501 --> 05:34.251
Yeah, you...

05:34.253 --> 05:35.619
You don't remember that?

05:35.621 --> 05:38.255
Uh, I've done
a lot of cool stuff, Ted.

05:39.424 --> 05:42.075
Oh, my God.

05:42.077 --> 05:43.927
I just... I just realized:

05:43.929 --> 05:45.512
Who am I gonna high five now?

05:45.514 --> 05:47.765
Come on, dude.
No, no,

05:47.767 --> 05:49.800
I'm being serious.
What if I see...

05:49.802 --> 05:52.519
a pack of lions
fighting a tyrannosaurus?

05:52.521 --> 05:54.054
Or, better yet,

05:54.056 --> 05:55.806
what if I see boobs?

05:55.808 --> 05:57.524
Who am I...
who am I gonna high five then?

05:57.526 --> 05:58.642
You can high
five Marshall.

05:58.644 --> 06:00.060
Yeah, yeah. But Marshall

06:00.062 --> 06:02.146
only likes to high five
about Lily boobs.

06:02.148 --> 06:04.064
Oh, always.

06:04.066 --> 06:06.283
Okay, Barney.

06:06.285 --> 06:08.202
I have an idea.

06:08.204 --> 06:10.154
One last high five.

06:10.156 --> 06:13.940
A high five to echo
throughout eternity.

06:13.942 --> 06:15.442
Yes.

06:15.444 --> 06:17.077
And within
that high five will be

06:17.079 --> 06:19.296
all the high fives
we've ever high fived.

06:19.298 --> 06:22.416
And all the high fives we
could ever possibly high five.

06:22.418 --> 06:24.384
A high infinity.

06:24.386 --> 06:25.919
A high infinity, exactly.

06:25.921 --> 06:26.953
Let's do this.

06:26.955 --> 06:28.455
All right,
everybody back up.

06:28.457 --> 06:30.641
Oh, boy.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.979
I'll see you
on the other side, Ray.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.149
Nice working with you,
Dr. Venkman.

06:42.238 --> 06:44.238
Aah!

06:44.972 --> 06:47.191
Ow!
Ow!

06:47.193 --> 06:49.643
Oh. Oh.
Oh!

06:49.645 --> 06:50.777
Worth it.

06:50.779 --> 06:52.979
So worth it.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.083
So I rushed out
to make the train,

06:56.085 --> 06:58.001
which is now 45 minutes late.

06:58.003 --> 07:00.487
This lady
with the bass guitar--

07:00.489 --> 07:02.089
was she pretty?

07:05.594 --> 07:07.344
Yeah.

07:07.346 --> 07:08.495
She was beautiful.

07:08.497 --> 07:09.963
Go back and meet her.

07:09.965 --> 07:11.465
No.

07:11.467 --> 07:13.433
But what if it was destiny?

07:15.854 --> 07:19.172
Lady, it's been
a really long weekend.

07:19.174 --> 07:21.975
I'm moving to Chicago tomorrow.

07:21.977 --> 07:24.361
I can't really
talk destiny right now.

07:24.363 --> 07:26.530
Okay.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.822
Yes?

07:35.824 --> 07:40.410
What if the universe
sent you a gigantic sign

07:40.412 --> 07:43.580
that this woman
<i>was</i> your destiny?

07:43.582 --> 07:45.198
Then would you talk to her?

07:46.751 --> 07:49.503
Yeah, sure. I mean,
I-I guess I would have to.

07:49.505 --> 07:50.504
Okay.

07:50.506 --> 07:52.556
Okay.

07:52.558 --> 07:54.040
Where is that train?

07:54.042 --> 07:56.677
Can I ask one more question?

07:56.679 --> 07:58.044
What?

07:58.046 --> 08:00.681
This girl with the bass guitar--

08:00.683 --> 08:02.382
is that her?

08:08.004 --> 08:09.688
That <i>is</i> her, isn't it?

08:09.690 --> 08:12.141
This is so exciting.

08:12.243 --> 08:13.576
G-Go talk to her.

08:13.578 --> 08:16.061
All right. Just be cool,
lady. Damn.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.746
Why are you still
sitting here?

08:17.748 --> 08:21.267
Because I'm moving to
Chicago tomorrow, remember?

08:21.269 --> 08:23.002
And 24 hours
from now,

08:23.004 --> 08:26.505
my life is gonna be
completely different.

08:26.507 --> 08:29.425
<i>This is so strange,</i>
<i>you know, now that Ted's</i>

08:29.427 --> 08:33.479
gone, it's just a...
a different vibe.

08:33.481 --> 08:36.965
You can just f-feel
his absence.

08:36.967 --> 08:38.683
Are you kidding me?!

08:38.686 --> 08:39.735
Oh, hey.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.986
Ted, what are
you doing here?

08:41.989 --> 08:43.138
Just having a drink.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.573
What are you doing
in New York?

08:44.575 --> 08:46.108
Aren't you
supposed to be in Chicago?

08:46.110 --> 08:47.743
No... Oh.

08:47.745 --> 08:49.245
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

08:49.247 --> 08:50.646
What?
What?

08:50.648 --> 08:54.166
I'm not moving to Chicago.
Why?

08:54.168 --> 08:55.751
I met a girl.
You...

08:55.753 --> 08:57.203
son of a bitch!

08:57.205 --> 08:58.871
What is the matter with you?

08:58.873 --> 09:00.322
How could you put us
through that?

09:00.324 --> 09:03.292
That good-bye was
emotionally devastating.

09:03.294 --> 09:06.178
A certain delicate flower
cried all night in the shower.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.047
And I was pretty
bummed, too.

09:08.049 --> 09:09.048
And now you're

09:09.050 --> 09:10.549
staying because of some girl?

09:10.551 --> 09:12.718
I mean, who is
this person?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.520
The bass player
from the wedding band.

09:14.522 --> 09:15.971
Oh, yeah, she's great.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.106
Love her.
Right,

09:17.108 --> 09:18.674
right?

09:18.676 --> 09:21.110
What are you... What are you doing?
Calling her.

09:21.112 --> 09:23.596
Don't do this.
Don't call her the next day.

09:23.598 --> 09:24.763
You're blowing this.
Huh?

09:24.765 --> 09:26.682
Three days.
You wait three days,

09:26.684 --> 09:27.733
Ted.
Oh, the

09:27.735 --> 09:30.236
three day rule
is-is a childish,

09:30.238 --> 09:32.538
manipulative
mind game.

09:32.540 --> 09:34.740
But yeah, you
wait three days.

09:34.742 --> 09:38.160
H-Hey, it's Ted. Hi. Um,

09:38.162 --> 09:40.879
listen, do you ... do you want
to have dinner tomorrow night?

09:40.881 --> 09:42.364
Great.

09:42.366 --> 09:44.216
It was clear I meant
with me, right?

09:45.135 --> 09:47.670
Same answer. Solid.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.006
Why does he keep
doing this?

09:51.008 --> 09:53.809
He meets 'em,
he likes 'em way too much,

09:53.811 --> 09:56.979
he goes way too big, too soon,
and he ends up blowing it.

09:56.981 --> 09:58.847
I can't take this anymore.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.734
He's fallen in love
so many times now.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.054
Not like this.

10:06.056 --> 10:08.223
This is different.

10:08.225 --> 10:10.559
Come on, go talk to her.

10:10.561 --> 10:12.611
Oh, and it'll all be
because of me.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.414
And I'll sing
at your wedding.

10:15.416 --> 10:17.616
Y-You are gonna have
a big wedding, right?

10:17.618 --> 10:20.169
What? No.
Just be cool, lady. Damn.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.906
And aren't big weddings
kind of a young man's game?

10:24.908 --> 10:27.075
You don't have a big wedding
in your 30s.

10:27.077 --> 10:28.961
If I do ever get married,

10:28.963 --> 10:30.679
I'm keeping it simple.

10:30.681 --> 10:32.848
<i>A hot air balloon?</i>

10:32.850 --> 10:35.134
Well, yeah. I mean,
when you're getting married

10:35.136 --> 10:37.603
in a 17th-century castle in
France and making your entrance

10:37.605 --> 10:39.138
on a stagecoach
with six white horses,

10:39.140 --> 10:41.273
you kind of got to make
a big exit.

10:41.275 --> 10:44.393
How much are you
spending on this?

10:44.395 --> 10:46.895
Oh, like, a lot of money.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.280
Mm.
All of my money.

10:48.282 --> 10:50.816
Look, I know you guys
have been traveling a lot,

10:50.818 --> 10:52.234
but you're coming, right?

10:52.236 --> 10:54.102
Oh course. What...
Duh.

10:55.623 --> 10:57.105
I'll get the next round.

10:57.107 --> 10:58.157
Thanks.

10:58.159 --> 10:59.291
I'd offer, but...

10:59.293 --> 11:00.409
Castle.

11:00.411 --> 11:03.162
Yeah.

11:03.164 --> 11:04.780
So, how you guys doing?

11:04.782 --> 11:06.632
I mean, Robin's really
taking off at work, huh?

11:06.634 --> 11:10.252
It's like, "Robin Scherbatsky,
World Wide News, Caracas."

11:10.254 --> 11:13.088
"Robin Scherbatsky, World Wide
News, St. Petersburg."

11:13.090 --> 11:14.723
"Robin Scherbatsky,
World Wide News,

11:14.725 --> 11:17.176
anywhere but New York,
apparently."

11:17.178 --> 11:18.460
But it's great.

11:18.462 --> 11:20.729
Uh, it's makes things
super difficult for us,

11:20.731 --> 11:23.599
but it's great. It's great.

11:23.601 --> 11:26.068
It's great. It's great.

11:26.070 --> 11:27.152
One more and I'll believe you.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.321
It's great.
Sounds great.

11:29.323 --> 11:30.980
Hey.
Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.260
Can I talk to you for a minute?

11:32.285 --> 11:34.645
Yeah, sure. Did you wire the
down payment to the castle guy?

11:35.145 --> 11:36.662
I got a castle guy.

11:36.664 --> 11:39.081
I've got, like,
three castle guys.

11:39.083 --> 11:41.784
And a moat guy, so...

11:41.786 --> 11:44.787
I didn't wire the
payment because

11:44.789 --> 11:48.140
I don't think we can get
married in September.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.192
What-What, why?
Because,

11:50.194 --> 11:52.160
when I do get married,

11:52.162 --> 11:54.797
I kind of want to fit

11:54.799 --> 11:57.666
in... my dress.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.969
Why wouldn't you f...

12:01.671 --> 12:02.771
No.

12:02.773 --> 12:03.772
Yeah.

12:03.774 --> 12:04.840
No.
Yeah.

12:04.842 --> 12:05.841
Yeah, yeah.

12:05.843 --> 12:08.026
Yeah.
Whoa.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.397
What's going on?

12:11.399 --> 12:13.866
She's getting a boob job.

12:15.184 --> 12:17.536
<i>We just peeked in on Penny</i>

12:17.538 --> 12:18.954
asleep in the baby room.

12:18.956 --> 12:20.072
It's adorable.

12:20.074 --> 12:22.458
The whole place
looks great, guys.

12:22.460 --> 12:25.577
But I can't believe you let Ted
hang his jousting lance

12:25.579 --> 12:27.963
from the renaissance fair
on your bedroom wall.

12:27.965 --> 12:29.882
Yeah.

12:29.884 --> 12:31.366
That's Ted's.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.886
So, Marshall, how's your job going?
Mm.

12:33.888 --> 12:36.037
My chair...

12:36.039 --> 12:38.123
is reasonably comfortable.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.392
For short periods of time.

12:40.394 --> 12:42.878
Marshall has decided to say

12:42.880 --> 12:45.681
only positive things about
being back in corporate law.

12:45.683 --> 12:46.715
So you hate it?

12:46.717 --> 12:49.718
Much of what I do does not
make me cry.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.488
But the job's only temporary.

12:52.490 --> 12:55.407
Marshall was offered
the judgeship once,

12:55.409 --> 12:57.159
and he turned it down for me.

12:57.161 --> 12:59.778
So, karmically, that phone
has to ring again.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.697
And even if it doesn't,

13:01.699 --> 13:03.499
today, when my boss

13:03.501 --> 13:06.401
threw his egg salad sandwich
at my face,

13:06.403 --> 13:08.337
some of it got into my mouth.

13:08.339 --> 13:10.339
And it was tasty.

13:10.341 --> 13:12.541
Hey, what
about you guys?

13:12.543 --> 13:14.009
How was Argentina?

13:15.578 --> 13:17.746
Great. It was great.

13:17.748 --> 13:19.097
It was great.
It was great.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.883
It was great.
It <i>was</i> great.

13:20.885 --> 13:23.752
It was great.

13:23.754 --> 13:25.637
One more and I'll
believe you.

13:26.941 --> 13:28.857
This is so not great.

13:28.859 --> 13:31.610
I'm sorry that I have
to work while I'm here.

13:31.612 --> 13:32.979
It's called being on assignment.

13:33.004 --> 13:35.365
Well, what about me? There's
no Wi-Fi in this hotel.

13:35.366 --> 13:37.483
How am I supposed to
run a business, Robin,

13:37.485 --> 13:39.234
with no Wi-Fi?

13:39.236 --> 13:41.453
It's not a business,
Barney, it's a blog, okay?

13:41.455 --> 13:43.372
It is a lifestyle blog.

13:43.374 --> 13:46.492
For the upscale, sophisticated
urban gentleman, and it's

13:46.494 --> 13:50.295
never gonna take off if I can't
post today's boner joke.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.584
I know I'm always traveling.

13:55.586 --> 13:57.920
We both hate it when
I'm gone, we both hate it

13:57.922 --> 14:00.722
when I drag you with me.
Neither of us is happy.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.476
Is this just not
working anymore?

14:04.478 --> 14:07.346
Wait, w... What "this"?
This-this?

14:07.348 --> 14:11.683
If I gave you an out,
right now--

14:11.685 --> 14:13.902
if there was
an exit ramp right here

14:13.904 --> 14:17.406
at the three-year mark--

14:17.408 --> 14:19.408
would you take it?

14:20.977 --> 14:22.327
Before I answer that,
real quick:

14:22.329 --> 14:24.646
you want to get super drunk
and have sex right now?

14:24.648 --> 14:26.415
Of course.

14:26.417 --> 14:28.917
And then, one thing
led to another.

14:28.919 --> 14:30.485
And then another.

14:30.487 --> 14:31.703
And then another
after that.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.088
Oh.
Oh.

14:33.090 --> 14:35.507
And we kept drinking, and

14:35.509 --> 14:38.126
may have had
a little... too much.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.182
<i>Arigato.</i>

14:44.184 --> 14:45.717
Wow, these rooms
all look the same,

14:45.719 --> 14:47.002
even when you're sober.

14:47.004 --> 14:49.471
You're sober?

14:51.524 --> 14:53.842
So, um...

14:53.844 --> 14:57.446
about what we discussed
last night.

14:59.015 --> 15:01.366
How do you feel?

15:08.491 --> 15:10.626
I love you, Robin.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.248
And when we got married,

15:16.250 --> 15:22.170
I made a vow that I would always
tell you the truth.

15:23.706 --> 15:27.809
We got divorced.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.086
I can't believe you got
divorced without telling us.

15:36.087 --> 15:38.721
This is my mom and
dad all over again.

15:38.723 --> 15:40.940
Barney, if you start
brewing your own beer now

15:40.942 --> 15:42.709
and nail my prom
date, so help me...

15:42.711 --> 15:44.277
Years too late on
one of those, Teddy.

15:44.979 --> 15:46.546
Guys, it's okay.

15:46.548 --> 15:48.581
This isn't
a failed marriage.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.233
It's a very
successful marriage

15:50.235 --> 15:52.118
that happened to
only last three years.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.120
You both want this?

15:54.122 --> 15:55.955
For real?

15:55.957 --> 15:57.957
We do.

15:57.959 --> 15:59.775
For real.

16:00.544 --> 16:03.429
Lily, you okay?

16:03.431 --> 16:04.964
Of course
I'm not okay.

16:04.966 --> 16:07.417
This ruins
everything.

16:07.419 --> 16:08.751
Now we have to choose sides,

16:08.753 --> 16:10.887
and obviously
we're gonna choose Robin,

16:10.889 --> 16:12.722
but Barney has his moments.

16:12.724 --> 16:14.223
I really liked

16:14.225 --> 16:15.641
the boner joke of the day.

16:15.643 --> 16:17.977
Look, you guys do not need
to pick sides.

16:17.979 --> 16:19.187
Nothing has to change.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.647
No. We've already
broken up before

16:20.648 --> 16:22.682
and we've stayed friends,
remember?

16:22.684 --> 16:26.652
As long as you promise me this
won't mean we stop hanging out.

16:26.654 --> 16:28.855
Okay.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.656
I'm serious.
I know, but, I mean,

16:30.658 --> 16:32.608
we hardly hang out anymore
anyway.

16:32.610 --> 16:34.643
They live in the suburbs now,

16:34.645 --> 16:36.662
and you two are about
to have baby number three.

16:38.315 --> 16:40.450
Please. You're so obvious.

16:40.452 --> 16:42.985
Your gals are back up
to a full C-cup,

16:42.987 --> 16:45.154
and you've been sipping
her drink all night long.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.590
We didn't want
to announce anything

16:47.592 --> 16:48.958
till we knew for sure.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.343
Oh, my gosh, Lily!

16:50.345 --> 16:51.928
That's amazing!
Oh, congratulations!

16:51.930 --> 16:53.996
Oh, my God.
Wait, see?

16:53.998 --> 16:55.631
This, right here,

16:55.633 --> 16:58.834
this is why we can't fall
out of each other's lives.

16:58.836 --> 17:01.437
We have to be here
for the big moments.

17:01.439 --> 17:03.856
Just promise me,
no matter what,

17:03.858 --> 17:06.692
we will always be there
for the big moments.

17:06.694 --> 17:10.846
I-I promise. We'll-we'll always
be there for the big moments.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.699
Mm.
See?

17:13.701 --> 17:16.519
It's like this whole divorce
thing never happened.

17:17.789 --> 17:18.988
I...

17:21.657 --> 17:23.041
Hey.
Hi, sweetie.

17:23.044 --> 17:24.627
How was work?

17:24.628 --> 17:27.829
My-my boss only called me
three words

17:27.832 --> 17:30.500
that meant "vagina" today.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.035
How are the kids?
Asleep.

17:33.037 --> 17:35.171
Good. This is working, right?

17:35.173 --> 17:38.257
Marvin and Daisy sharing a room
together? It's not too cramped?

17:38.259 --> 17:40.259
And then when the
next one arrives,

17:40.261 --> 17:43.229
we'll just put her
crib... in the shower.

17:43.231 --> 17:45.932
It's the perfect size.
It'll save time on cleanups...

17:45.934 --> 17:46.882
Let's move
somewhere bigger.

17:46.884 --> 17:48.851
Yes. Oh, thank God.

17:48.853 --> 17:51.387
I mean... You know,

17:51.389 --> 17:53.889
don't get me wrong.
I love this apartment.

17:53.891 --> 17:56.159
How do you say good-bye
to so many special memories?

17:56.161 --> 17:59.078
Cock-a-mouse!
We have to move!

18:02.466 --> 18:06.002
Hey, Marshall.
Robin!

18:06.004 --> 18:08.337
Hey, I'm so glad you're here.
It's-it's been forever.

18:08.339 --> 18:10.006
Oh, hey.
Hey.

18:10.008 --> 18:11.707
Where's your...
where's your costume?

18:11.709 --> 18:14.293
Oh, uh, it's been
a crazy week at work

18:14.295 --> 18:16.045
so no time to go shopping.

18:16.047 --> 18:18.347
Uh, well, who are
you supposed to be?

18:18.349 --> 18:20.749
Okay, I want to make it clear
this is not my idea.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.552
I'm Captain Ahab.

18:22.554 --> 18:24.804
Why is it bad
if it was your idea?

18:24.806 --> 18:26.889
Robin, you made it!
A white whale. Got it.

18:26.891 --> 18:29.108
Aw. Hi.
Hi.

18:29.110 --> 18:30.610
Yeah, I figured,

18:30.612 --> 18:33.929
people are thinkin' it. Might as
well steer into the skid, right?

18:33.931 --> 18:35.615
Where's your costume?

18:35.617 --> 18:36.899
Oh, you know,
I've just been so...

18:36.901 --> 18:38.401
Oh, my God, Marshall!

18:38.403 --> 18:40.102
Guess whose digits
I just scored?

18:40.104 --> 18:42.405
The slutty
police officer's...

18:42.407 --> 18:44.740
tax attorney.

18:44.742 --> 18:46.275
Hey, Robin!

18:46.277 --> 18:48.077
Hey.
Didn't see you there.

18:48.079 --> 18:50.413
Saved it.

18:50.415 --> 18:51.914
Sorry, I got to pee.

18:51.916 --> 18:54.717
I-I'll be back
in... an hour.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.589
Oh, man.

18:59.591 --> 19:02.175
Is Ted still wearing
his hanging chad costume?

19:02.177 --> 19:04.227
How old is that thing?
It's gone

19:04.229 --> 19:06.962
from played out to
charmingly retro and back

19:06.964 --> 19:08.464
six or seven times now.

19:08.466 --> 19:09.932
Kind of
like Ted himself.

19:09.934 --> 19:12.101
Tonight it's working
for him though.

19:12.103 --> 19:15.771
<i>How do you do this, Ted?</i>
<i>How do you</i>

19:15.773 --> 19:18.157
sit out here all night
on the roof in the cold

19:18.159 --> 19:21.060
and still have faith
your pumpkin's gonna show up?

19:21.062 --> 19:23.779
Look, I know that odds are
the love of my life

19:23.781 --> 19:25.831
isn't gonna magically walk
through that door

19:25.833 --> 19:27.650
in a pumpkin costume at...

19:27.652 --> 19:30.152
2:43 in the morning, but...

19:30.154 --> 19:33.873
this seems as nice a spot
as any to just, you know...

19:33.875 --> 19:36.475
sit and wait.

19:43.634 --> 19:45.851
Um...

19:45.853 --> 19:48.837
uh, c-can you tell Lily
I-I had to go?

19:48.839 --> 19:50.473
I got to split.

19:53.977 --> 19:55.844
Speaking of splits, do you think
I can do a split in midair

19:55.846 --> 19:57.813
like my boy
David Lee Roth?

19:57.815 --> 19:58.681
I know you can't.

19:58.683 --> 20:00.349
Challenge accepted.

20:05.822 --> 20:08.124
Oh, my scrotum!

20:15.799 --> 20:17.383
I can't get out
of this thing.

20:17.385 --> 20:18.801
I'm holding it.

20:18.803 --> 20:21.003
Wait, are you leaving?
Yeah,

20:21.005 --> 20:23.038
I got a big day tomorrow.
I got to get some sleep.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.058
No, you can't leave.
This is a big moment.

20:26.060 --> 20:28.477
We're saying good-bye
to the apartment.

20:28.479 --> 20:30.846
The whole gang has to be here.

20:30.848 --> 20:32.465
The gang?

20:32.467 --> 20:35.234
Do you know who the gang is
to me, Lily?

20:35.986 --> 20:36.902
Here's what the gang is:

20:36.904 --> 20:39.105
the gang is a married couple

20:39.107 --> 20:42.658
who I never see anymore,
about to have their third kid;

20:42.660 --> 20:44.694
it's my ex-husband,

20:44.696 --> 20:47.747
hitting on slutty cops
right in front of me;

20:47.749 --> 20:51.734
and it's the guy I probably
should have ended up with

20:51.736 --> 20:54.036
with the beautiful mother
of his child.

20:54.038 --> 20:56.289
I mean, who in their right mind
would call

20:56.291 --> 20:58.407
that group of people "the gang"?

20:58.409 --> 21:00.593
Oh...

21:02.412 --> 21:04.930
Oh, oh, so... so what?

21:04.932 --> 21:06.599
This is all

21:06.601 --> 21:08.351
just over then?

21:08.353 --> 21:11.804
Our whole friendship
is just over?

21:11.806 --> 21:14.857
No. No, of course not.
Look, we'll...

21:14.859 --> 21:17.610
we'll always be friends.
It's just...

21:17.612 --> 21:20.279
never gonna be how it was.

21:21.315 --> 21:22.598
It can't be.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.816
And that doesn't

21:23.818 --> 21:26.101
have to be a sad thing.

21:26.103 --> 21:28.571
There-There's so much
wonderful stuff happening

21:28.573 --> 21:31.106
in all of our
lives right now.

21:31.108 --> 21:33.409
Look, more than enough
to be grateful for.

21:34.444 --> 21:37.279
But the five of us
hanging out at MacLaren's,

21:37.281 --> 21:39.131
being young and stupid...

21:39.133 --> 21:42.718
that's just not one
of those things.

21:44.004 --> 21:46.055
That part's over.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.393
I got to go.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.562
Good night, Lily.

21:54.398 --> 21:56.899
Good night.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.302
<i>Marshall's almost here.</i>

22:17.304 --> 22:19.221
Yes! Look at us,

22:19.223 --> 22:22.157
hanging out again.
This is amazing.

22:22.159 --> 22:23.625
This is awesome!

22:23.627 --> 22:27.629
This is...
Okay.

22:27.631 --> 22:29.815
Just settle down, buddy.
No!

22:29.817 --> 22:33.435
Settling down is for losers with
kids who never go out anymore.

22:33.437 --> 22:34.570
I am in
charge tonight,

22:34.572 --> 22:37.139
and the earliest
I am allowing anyone

22:37.141 --> 22:39.808
to go home is...
2:00 a.m.

22:39.810 --> 22:41.493
10:00 p.m.
9:45.

22:41.495 --> 22:42.694
3:00 a.m.

22:42.696 --> 22:45.697
Guys, tonight
is gonna be legen--

22:45.699 --> 22:48.450
wait for it...

22:48.452 --> 22:49.785
If I leave now,

22:49.787 --> 22:50.869
I could put
the kids to bed.

22:50.871 --> 22:51.870
I'll get the check.

22:51.872 --> 22:53.172
..dary!

22:53.174 --> 22:54.756
Legendary!

22:54.758 --> 22:56.875
Guys, the gang is back!

22:56.877 --> 23:00.328
We're back!

23:00.330 --> 23:03.182
All of us except for Robin.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.500
We never see her anymore.

23:05.502 --> 23:07.186
Okay, in addition
to you guys not going home

23:07.188 --> 23:09.838
before 4:00 a.m.--
yes, it's up to 4:00 now--

23:09.840 --> 23:13.008
new rule: anytime anyone talks
about something sad,

23:13.010 --> 23:15.277
we stay out an extra hour.

23:15.279 --> 23:17.646
We said we'd always be there
for the big moments.

23:17.648 --> 23:19.398
5:00 a.m.
To be fair,

23:19.400 --> 23:20.849
tonight's just
us hanging out

23:20.851 --> 23:22.317
until 10:00 p.m., tops.

23:22.319 --> 23:23.318
It's not a big moment.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.319
Um,

23:24.321 --> 23:25.871
yes, it is.
Um, no, it's not.

23:25.873 --> 23:29.124
Um, yes, it is.
Um... no, it's not.

23:29.126 --> 23:31.543
Um, yes, it is.

23:31.545 --> 23:33.912
I got a phone call today.

23:33.914 --> 23:37.649
A judge in Queens is retiring,
so...

23:37.651 --> 23:39.485
I'm gonna be a judge.

23:40.304 --> 23:42.471
Yes! Yes!

23:42.473 --> 23:44.973
Judge Eriksen!

23:44.975 --> 23:47.559
Yeah!
 One more.

23:47.561 --> 23:50.879
I told you the phone would
ring. You deserve this.

23:50.881 --> 23:52.397
Thanks, Lily.

23:52.399 --> 23:55.267
- I love you, Marshmallow.
- Oh.

23:55.269 --> 23:56.852
1:45 a.m.

23:56.854 --> 23:59.354
Well, you were right, Barney,
this night was, in fact,

23:59.356 --> 24:01.401
legendary, but...

24:01.426 --> 24:02.692
I know what you're gonna say
and I agree.

24:02.693 --> 24:04.109
We're going to Vegas!

24:04.111 --> 24:05.527
I will be awakened

24:05.529 --> 24:09.698
by screaming children
in less than...

24:09.700 --> 24:12.284
four-and-a-half hours.

24:12.286 --> 24:13.418
You're staying.

24:13.420 --> 24:14.402
I'm going.

24:14.404 --> 24:15.754
Judge Fudge,
your very first ruling?

24:15.756 --> 24:17.172
He stays.

24:17.174 --> 24:18.540
Hey! See?

24:18.542 --> 24:20.092
Tonight is about

24:20.094 --> 24:23.378
celebrating our enduring bond
as friends.

24:23.380 --> 24:26.414
Nay, family. Because
that's what we are, Ted.

24:26.416 --> 24:27.633
We are fa...

24:27.635 --> 24:29.017
Okay, fun night,
guys. Keep in touch.

24:29.019 --> 24:30.585
Damn it, Barney.

24:30.587 --> 24:33.438
Crushing... windpipe.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.691
You're lucky that's
the only pipe I'm crushing.

24:35.693 --> 24:38.093
Aah!
That woman is half your age.

24:38.095 --> 24:40.262
Haven't you changed,
even a little?

24:40.264 --> 24:42.364
No. I haven't.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.067
Look, I know
there was a time

24:45.069 --> 24:47.202
when it seemed like I was
capable of going the distance,

24:47.204 --> 24:51.206
but... if it wasn't gonna
happen with Robin,

24:51.208 --> 24:53.709
then it's just not gonna
happen with anyone.

24:53.711 --> 24:54.943
I am never

24:54.945 --> 24:56.828
gonna be a guy
who meets a girl

24:56.830 --> 24:59.131
and, from the first time
I see her, I'm just like,

24:59.133 --> 25:01.833
"You are the
love of my life.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.285
"Everything
I have

25:03.287 --> 25:07.089
and everything I am
is yours forever."

25:07.091 --> 25:08.312
Really?

25:08.337 --> 25:10.416
No, I'm just making a point.
Move it along.

25:11.294 --> 25:13.562
That's not me.

25:13.564 --> 25:15.630
I'm the guy
who straightens his tie,

25:15.632 --> 25:17.349
says something dirty,
high-fives himself

25:17.351 --> 25:19.651
and then goes and talks
to that girl over there.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.337
That's me.

25:22.339 --> 25:26.241
Can I please... just be me?

25:27.977 --> 25:30.112
Judge Fudge?

25:31.981 --> 25:34.333
I'll allow it.

25:34.335 --> 25:37.953
Then I'll a-plow it. Self-five.

25:37.955 --> 25:40.706
Stinson out.

25:43.177 --> 25:46.044
Oh!

25:46.046 --> 25:47.846
Hey, so are you guys

25:47.848 --> 25:49.514
ever gonna tie the knot
or are you...

25:49.516 --> 25:51.683
are you just comfortable
living in sin?

25:51.685 --> 25:52.884
Someone's gotten a bit...

25:52.886 --> 25:54.502
judge-y.
Oh!

25:54.504 --> 25:56.688
- Sustained.
- Yeah.

25:56.690 --> 25:58.523
We'll get around to it.
It's just, you know,

25:58.525 --> 26:00.859
with life and
jobs and kids.

26:00.861 --> 26:02.677
Plus, this one's still
insisting on getting married

26:02.679 --> 26:03.862
in a French castle.

26:03.864 --> 26:06.982
I'd get married tomorrow
in a White Castle,

26:06.984 --> 26:09.851
but this guy needs
more "wow factor."

26:09.853 --> 26:12.154
You're all the wow factor
I need.

26:12.156 --> 26:13.538
Aw!

26:15.993 --> 26:18.486
Glad someone can be happy
on the day of a tragedy.

26:18.487 --> 26:18.957
Aw, Barney,

26:18.962 --> 26:20.996
you know this is
all fake, right?

26:20.998 --> 26:22.748
That robot's
not really dead.

26:22.750 --> 26:24.082
I'm not

26:24.084 --> 26:27.135
talking about the robot, Lily.
Everyone,

26:27.137 --> 26:30.872
stop having fun! I'm about
to tell a sad story!

26:30.874 --> 26:35.043
Guys, remember back in 2010
when I achieved a perfect week?

26:35.045 --> 26:37.045
Seven girls in
seven nights, sure.

26:37.047 --> 26:38.480
Well, recently,

26:38.482 --> 26:40.265
I decided to attempt...

26:40.267 --> 26:42.334
a perfect month.

26:42.336 --> 26:45.270
<i>I put together</i>
<i>a brand-new playbook.</i>

26:45.272 --> 26:48.106
No, I can't hear this.
This is just too sad.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.192
But I haven't gotten
to the sad part yet.

26:50.194 --> 26:52.560
You're in your 40s and
you have a playbook.

26:52.562 --> 26:53.561
That's

26:53.563 --> 26:54.613
the sad part.

26:54.615 --> 26:56.782
Lily... just...

26:56.784 --> 26:58.500
Okay?

26:58.502 --> 27:01.286
So I put together
a brand-new playbook,

27:01.288 --> 27:04.373
filled with plays
I'd never tried before, like...

27:05.825 --> 27:07.709
<i>...where,</i>
<i>as in the '80s classic,</i>

27:07.711 --> 27:12.097
<i>I magically</i> come <i>to life,</i>
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

27:13.533 --> 27:16.184
<i>...where I wait till a girl</i>
<i>mentions something she likes.</i>

27:16.186 --> 27:17.919
God, I love nachos.

27:17.921 --> 27:19.971
Thank you.

27:19.973 --> 27:21.556
Allow me to introduce myself.

27:21.558 --> 27:22.774
My name is Jim,

27:22.776 --> 27:24.592
Jim Nacho.

27:24.594 --> 27:28.613
Inventor of the nacho.

27:28.615 --> 27:30.399
So... did you get
a perfect month?

27:30.401 --> 27:32.784
Yes.

27:32.786 --> 27:34.602
Then why are
you so upset?

27:34.604 --> 27:37.072
That last girl, number 31...

27:37.074 --> 27:40.075
Oh, that's a pretty name.
What is that, French?

27:40.077 --> 27:42.494
...she's pregnant.

27:46.741 --> 27:48.257
Wait, you're messing
with us, right?

27:48.282 --> 27:50.256
You didn't really
get a girl pregnant?

27:50.569 --> 27:52.176
It's real.

27:52.201 --> 27:53.592
She's pregnant.

27:55.019 --> 27:56.231
Kinda puts an asterisk,

27:56.256 --> 27:58.271
on the whole perfect
month thing, huh?

27:59.875 --> 28:01.826
Barney,
are you okay?

28:02.711 --> 28:05.046
Ah, Jim Nantz.

28:05.048 --> 28:07.916
Thank goodness. You're always
here for me in times of trouble.

28:07.918 --> 28:09.417
What should I do?

28:09.419 --> 28:11.285
You're on your own
this time, bro.

28:12.588 --> 28:14.789
Congratulations, Papa.

28:14.791 --> 28:17.558
Stop it. This is a disaster.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.509
Why?

28:18.511 --> 28:20.795
Why? Because I'm too old.

28:20.797 --> 28:22.063
I was about

28:22.065 --> 28:26.100
to enter my golden years,
my Clooney years,

28:26.102 --> 28:28.653
my daddy issues years,

28:28.655 --> 28:31.356
where I don't just remind
messed-up girls of their dads

28:31.358 --> 28:32.824
because I'm emotionally distant.

28:32.826 --> 28:36.261
I freaking look like
their dads. That's the dream.

28:36.263 --> 28:37.295
My life

28:37.297 --> 28:39.614
is over.

28:39.616 --> 28:42.750
So where are you guys
registered?

28:44.253 --> 28:47.588
<i>Another fun fact about the</i>
<i>Goliath National Bank building,</i>

28:47.590 --> 28:50.041
the sleek but historical facade
has been described

28:50.043 --> 28:53.795
by <i>Architecture Vision Monthly</i>
as "modern classicism."

28:53.797 --> 28:55.463
I can see that.

28:55.465 --> 28:57.632
Mm-hmm. Any questions
from the group?

28:57.634 --> 28:59.000
I have a
question.

28:59.002 --> 29:00.935
What happened to the building
that used to be here?

29:00.937 --> 29:02.220
It was way nicer.

29:02.222 --> 29:03.471
Robin!

29:03.473 --> 29:05.273
Oh, my God!

29:05.275 --> 29:07.008
What are you doing here?

29:07.010 --> 29:08.009
I thought you were in...

29:08.011 --> 29:10.561
Greece, uh, Morocco, Moscow.

29:10.563 --> 29:12.730
Yeah, World Wide News
keeps me pretty busy.

29:12.732 --> 29:14.015
And pretty famous.

29:14.017 --> 29:15.316
I mean, you're everywhere.

29:15.318 --> 29:18.019
I am not everywhere. The...

29:18.904 --> 29:20.621
Okay, I'm some places.

29:20.623 --> 29:22.907
Hi, Penny.

29:22.909 --> 29:26.127
Oh, my gosh, I haven't
seen you in forever.

29:26.129 --> 29:28.696
I like you, bus lady.
Oh,

29:28.698 --> 29:29.714
I like you, too.

29:29.716 --> 29:31.198
Never call me that again.

29:32.002 --> 29:33.501
And that was it.

29:33.503 --> 29:35.219
Wow.
Hm.

29:35.221 --> 29:38.756
A genuine Scherbatsky sighting
out in nature.

29:38.758 --> 29:42.176
At this point, that's
like seeing Sasquatch.

29:42.178 --> 29:44.812
No, Sasquatch is a warm
and affectionate creature.

29:44.814 --> 29:46.981
At this point, Robin's
more like the yeti--

29:46.983 --> 29:48.516
cold and aloof.

29:49.217 --> 29:50.852
Hey, Ted.

29:50.854 --> 29:53.154
Ask me if the Abominable
Snowman called.

29:53.156 --> 29:54.989
Has the Abominable Snowman
called?

29:54.991 --> 29:56.390
Not yeti.

29:57.059 --> 29:58.559
Here we are again.

29:58.561 --> 30:02.229
Another big moment for us,
and Robin's missing it.

30:02.231 --> 30:03.698
I know, baby.

30:03.700 --> 30:06.417
I mean, the birth of her
ex-husband's love child

30:06.419 --> 30:09.504
is a bit of a stretch--
but I know, baby.

30:11.925 --> 30:13.674
Well?

30:13.676 --> 30:15.426
It was... crazy in there,

30:15.428 --> 30:16.878
but...

30:16.880 --> 30:19.413
I threw up,
and now I feel better.

30:19.415 --> 30:20.548
Where were you?

30:20.550 --> 30:22.717
In the can.
I knew I was gonna urp,

30:22.719 --> 30:24.719
so I put this on over my suit.

30:24.721 --> 30:26.771
Number 31 won't let me
in the delivery room.

30:26.773 --> 30:28.589
We're gonna need a name
eventually.

30:28.591 --> 30:30.257
Mr. Stinson?

30:30.259 --> 30:32.193
Yes?
Congratulations.

30:32.195 --> 30:33.811
Congratulations because

30:33.813 --> 30:36.447
the blood test came back
and I'm not the father?!

30:36.449 --> 30:38.599
Happy Not a Father's Day!

30:38.601 --> 30:41.702
No. Congratulations.

30:41.704 --> 30:42.820
It's a girl.

30:42.822 --> 30:44.072
Would you like to meet her?

30:44.074 --> 30:45.573
Nah, I'm good.

30:45.575 --> 30:48.242
I don't...
Oh, just go meet your daughter!

30:49.111 --> 30:51.329
This is Ellie.

31:01.924 --> 31:04.425
I'll give you guys
a minute.

31:17.305 --> 31:21.159
You are the love
of my life.

31:25.748 --> 31:29.784
Everything I have...

31:29.786 --> 31:32.787
and everything I am...

31:34.156 --> 31:37.324
...is yours.

31:39.879 --> 31:42.046
Forever.

31:55.611 --> 31:56.811
What?

31:56.813 --> 31:59.147
Do I have stuff in my teeth?

31:59.149 --> 32:00.448
Give me your
engagement ring back.

32:00.450 --> 32:02.683
Just because I have
stuff in my teeth?

32:02.685 --> 32:04.351
We-we can work through this.

32:04.353 --> 32:05.703
Just give it back.

32:14.529 --> 32:18.532
If you don't get married in that
time, you have to re-propose.

32:18.534 --> 32:20.001
Will you...

32:20.003 --> 32:21.552
Yes. Yes, you silly man.

32:21.554 --> 32:22.753
Let me finish.

32:22.755 --> 32:23.821
Will you...

32:23.823 --> 32:25.039
Yes! Sorry.

32:25.557 --> 32:26.340
Yes.

32:26.342 --> 32:28.342
Will y...

32:28.344 --> 32:30.061
Will you marry me...

32:30.063 --> 32:31.729
on Thursday?

32:31.731 --> 32:34.882
I called your office--
you got nothing on Thursday.

32:34.884 --> 32:36.567
Will you marry me on Thursday?

32:36.569 --> 32:37.568
Yes.

32:45.995 --> 32:47.394
Same ring.

32:49.449 --> 32:51.582
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

32:51.584 --> 32:53.901
It's Ted Mosby's wedding day!

32:53.903 --> 32:56.737
Yes! After only seven
years and two kids.

32:56.739 --> 32:58.372
Guys, am I rushing
into this?

32:58.374 --> 32:59.590
Whoa.

32:59.592 --> 33:01.375
Oh, buddy, are you okay?

33:01.377 --> 33:03.761
So tired.

33:03.763 --> 33:05.913
Baby no sleepy.

33:05.915 --> 33:07.848
Barney dying.

33:07.850 --> 33:10.551
Well, we're staying out till
3:00 a.m. tonight.

33:10.553 --> 33:13.070
9:45!

33:13.072 --> 33:16.023
Seriously, though,
I am so proud of you.

33:16.025 --> 33:17.058
Not that
you're a dad.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.559
It's like
you're a totally

33:18.561 --> 33:19.977
different pers...
Whoa!

33:19.979 --> 33:22.230
And... we're back.

33:23.916 --> 33:25.700
Hey.

33:25.702 --> 33:28.069
Hi.
What to join us for shots?

33:28.071 --> 33:29.487
Shots?

33:29.489 --> 33:31.822
Before lunch on a Thursday?

33:31.824 --> 33:34.792
It's like you're <i>trying</i>
to make bad decisions.

33:34.794 --> 33:36.961
You young ladies
need to go home,

33:36.963 --> 33:38.612
put on some
decent clothes

33:38.614 --> 33:41.799
and take a good hard look
at your lives. Get!

33:42.634 --> 33:44.218
Call your parents--

33:44.220 --> 33:45.886
they're probably worried sick.

33:46.471 --> 33:48.923
I have officially

33:48.925 --> 33:51.259
seen everything.

33:53.345 --> 33:55.730
Not everything.

34:02.836 --> 34:05.287
Hi.
Hi.

34:08.992 --> 34:12.478
I-I know I've...
missed a couple lately, but...

34:12.480 --> 34:16.465
we said we'd always be there
for the big moments.

34:18.351 --> 34:20.152
Aw, crap.

34:20.154 --> 34:21.270
Mascara running.

34:21.272 --> 34:23.938
Nobody let her
out of your sight.

34:26.777 --> 34:28.860
Hi, Daddy.
Whoa.

34:28.862 --> 34:30.512
Look, Robin,
I'm really happy to see you,

34:30.514 --> 34:32.364
but I don't think of you
that way anymore.

34:32.366 --> 34:34.183
, dummy,
you had a kid.

34:34.185 --> 34:35.851
Congrats.
Right, yeah.

34:35.853 --> 34:37.620
Thanks. A kid.

34:37.621 --> 34:39.121
I'm tired.

34:39.123 --> 34:40.790
Oh.
But, uh,

34:40.792 --> 34:42.491
she's awesome.
Yeah?

34:42.493 --> 34:43.793
Yeah.

34:43.795 --> 34:45.860
Daddy's home.

34:48.364 --> 34:49.715
Mm.

34:49.717 --> 34:52.534
Judge Fudge? Hey?
 Hey...

34:52.536 --> 34:54.203
Actually, um, little
announcement for everybody.

34:54.205 --> 34:56.371
I'm gonna be running
for State Supreme Court.

34:56.373 --> 34:58.257
Yeah. So if
everything goes well,

34:58.259 --> 35:00.176
in a couple of months,
you won't be calling me

35:00.178 --> 35:01.894
Judge Fudge anymore.

35:01.896 --> 35:04.096
You'll be calling me
Fudge Supreme.

35:08.518 --> 35:10.286
The man of the hour.

35:10.288 --> 35:11.553
Yeah.

35:11.555 --> 35:13.072
You RSVP'd no.

35:13.074 --> 35:14.657
I did.

35:14.659 --> 35:19.394
But someone pretty persuasive
talked me into it.

35:24.567 --> 35:26.452
Sorry. I know
it's bad luck

35:26.454 --> 35:28.671
to see the bride
in her dress.

35:29.589 --> 35:31.373
Worth it.

35:33.627 --> 35:36.212
But I couldn't miss this.

35:36.214 --> 35:37.546
I want to get
a picture.

35:37.548 --> 35:39.932
Get in! I want to take
a picture of you guys.

35:39.934 --> 35:41.767
Come on, get together.

35:41.769 --> 35:43.085
Are you ready?

35:43.087 --> 35:45.271
All right, get in.
All right. All right.

35:45.273 --> 35:47.022
One, two,

35:47.024 --> 35:48.574
three.

35:56.283 --> 35:57.867
Hey. Hey, you kids.

35:57.869 --> 36:00.703
Yeah, you didn't sound
a <i>thousand</i> there.

36:02.739 --> 36:05.124
Do you have any idea
what happened right here

36:05.126 --> 36:06.625
in this very bar?

36:06.627 --> 36:08.410
No. What happened?

36:09.921 --> 36:11.837
Just...

36:13.924 --> 36:17.009
...just all kinds of stuff.

36:19.513 --> 36:20.463
A toast.

36:20.465 --> 36:21.964
Mm-hmm.

36:21.966 --> 36:23.332
Okay, first off...

36:23.334 --> 36:25.434
to everyone at
this table...

36:26.186 --> 36:28.271

guys so much,

36:29.474 --> 36:31.357
Just move to the second part.
Okay, okay.

36:31.359 --> 36:33.342
Secondly, to Ted...

36:33.344 --> 36:34.143
Don't say it.

36:34.145 --> 36:36.228
...Evelyn Mosby.

36:36.230 --> 36:37.947
Thank you for that.

36:37.949 --> 36:39.815
A man with...

36:39.817 --> 36:42.285
more emotional endurance

36:42.287 --> 36:44.704
than anyone I know.

36:44.706 --> 36:45.854
It was a long,

36:45.856 --> 36:48.124
difficult road.

36:48.126 --> 36:50.826
Thank God we
finally got here.

40:37.271 --> 40:38.821
you're totally in love
with Aunt Robin.

40:38.823 --> 40:40.389
And you're thinking
about asking her out,

40:40.391 --> 40:42.591
and you want to know
if we're okay with it.

40:42.593 --> 40:43.926
I can't believe this.

40:43.928 --> 40:47.696
I kept this story short
and to the point,

40:47.698 --> 40:49.598
and you guys still missed it.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.934
The point of the story
is that...

40:51.936 --> 40:54.937
Is that you totally, totally, totally
have the hots for Aunt Robin.

40:54.939 --> 40:55.621
No, I don't.

40:55.623 --> 40:57.156
Yes, you do.

40:57.158 --> 40:58.574
You're grounded.

40:58.576 --> 40:59.992
Wow, you are really
into Aunt Robin.

40:59.994 --> 41:01.076
You're grounded, too.

41:02.495 --> 41:06.465
Okay, suppose I <i>were</i> interested
in Aunt Robin in that way--

41:06.467 --> 41:08.551
it's not like
I'd do anything about it.

41:08.553 --> 41:10.786
I got you guys to think about.
My gosh,

41:10.788 --> 41:12.087
we <i>love</i> Aunt Robin.

41:12.089 --> 41:14.056
Whenever she comes over
for dinner, you guys

41:14.058 --> 41:15.975
are so obvious.

41:15.977 --> 41:17.076
Come on, Dad.

41:17.078 --> 41:19.862
Mom's been gone
for six years now.

41:19.864 --> 41:21.680
It's time.

41:22.983 --> 41:25.818
What, I just...
just call her up on the phone

41:25.820 --> 41:28.103
and ask her out on a date?

41:28.105 --> 41:29.405
Yes.
Yes.

41:29.407 --> 41:31.156
And that... that's something

41:31.158 --> 41:32.358
you guys would want?

41:32.360 --> 41:33.826
Yes!
Yes!

41:39.182 --> 41:41.483
All right, I'll give her a call.

41:41.485 --> 41:43.068
Do it.
I am.

41:43.070 --> 41:44.987
Call her.
I'm <i>calling</i> her.

41:44.989 --> 41:46.005
Great.

41:46.007 --> 41:48.323
Here I go.

41:51.127 --> 41:52.945
Or...

41:56.349 --> 41:58.634
All right, home sweet home.

41:58.636 --> 42:01.387
Oh. Wait one second.

42:01.389 --> 42:02.855
Okay.

42:02.857 --> 42:05.691
Stay.

42:05.693 --> 42:07.009
We'll work on that.

42:08.729 --> 42:11.697
Television, display
front door security.

42:11.699 --> 42:13.732
