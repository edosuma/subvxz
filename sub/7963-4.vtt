WEBVTT

00:08.041 --> 00:09.374
Ding dong.

00:09.459 --> 00:12.127
The presence of one Liz Greenberg, Esquire,

00:12.162 --> 00:14.212
is sincerely requested at the holiday party

00:14.298 --> 00:16.715
taking place just outside this boardroom.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.416
Yeah, sorry, Jimmy.

00:18.502 --> 00:21.469
I've got so much work to
finish before the break.

00:21.505 --> 00:23.722
Merry Christmas, Liz.

00:23.807 --> 00:26.091
Have a nice holiday.

00:26.176 --> 00:27.642
Hold the mistletoe.

00:27.678 --> 00:29.811
- Did Jimmy just ask you out?
- No.

00:29.846 --> 00:32.264
I don't think that could be
considered asking someone out.

00:32.348 --> 00:33.348
Jimmy's not my type.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.183
Cute and funny... not your type?

00:35.235 --> 00:37.018
I'm sorry.

00:37.104 --> 00:40.355
I'm not wasting my time
with some junior associate.

00:50.867 --> 00:52.534
- Stay back!
- Oh, my God.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.369
I am so sorry. I didn't
mean to frighten you.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.121
My name... my name is Santa.

00:56.206 --> 00:57.922
Santa Claus.

00:58.008 --> 00:59.424
Oh, my God.

00:59.509 --> 01:01.710
Of course I know who you are. I'm...

01:01.762 --> 01:04.846
But you, of course,
are not Jenny De Santos,

01:04.881 --> 01:09.351
which means that this Barbie
Dream Car is not for you.

01:09.386 --> 01:13.555
I'm going to have to take it
up with the elves, I guess.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.223
I'm Liz, by the way.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.775
Liz Greenberg.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.526
Wait a minute. You're not...

01:18.562 --> 01:20.478
Are you Elizabeth Greenberg

01:20.564 --> 01:21.896
from Evanston?

01:21.982 --> 01:23.732
Yes, I am. How did you know that?

01:23.784 --> 01:25.734
1994.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.286
You requested a graphing calculator.

01:28.372 --> 01:30.071
You don't often forget a gift like that.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.374
Not in a sea of My Little Ponies.

01:32.409 --> 01:33.742
I can't believe you remember that.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.243
I was just a little girl.

01:35.329 --> 01:39.381
Well, you're not a little girl anymore.

01:44.221 --> 01:46.137
The needle's loose.

01:46.223 --> 01:49.090
Do you mind if I, uh, take a look?

01:49.176 --> 01:51.593
- Sure.
- I'm a tinkerer by trade.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.596
I built my entire operation
from the ground up.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.599
Now, of course we have
all these systems in place,

01:57.684 --> 01:58.850
but, man, do I miss the days

01:58.935 --> 02:00.568
when I got to work with my hands.

02:04.107 --> 02:05.440
Chet Jenks Trio.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.242
- Mm-hmm.
- Man, you have great taste.

02:11.281 --> 02:12.664
There's my ride.

02:12.749 --> 02:14.449
Mmm.

02:14.534 --> 02:19.587
This has been a much nicer
treat than milk and cookies.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.760
Don't work too hard tonight, Liz.

02:25.796 --> 02:27.379
It's Christmas.

02:27.464 --> 02:29.964
That's my job.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.999
Hi, Liz. Welcome back.

03:05.051 --> 03:07.135
Nice holiday?

03:07.170 --> 03:09.838
Nothing exciting. I was just working.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.673
Well, this just came for you.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.174
What is that?

03:13.260 --> 03:15.894
- Who's it from?
- Well, I don't know.

03:23.353 --> 03:25.854
"Thanks for providing the
sweetest treat of the night.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.022
Best regards, SC."

03:28.074 --> 03:30.024
Nothing exciting, huh, Smiley?

03:30.076 --> 03:31.242
This is from my mother.

03:31.328 --> 03:34.078
- Yeah, right.
- Hey.

03:34.164 --> 03:36.748
SC? Liz...

03:36.833 --> 03:39.083
is this from Santa Claus?

03:39.169 --> 03:40.502
Yes, it is.

03:40.537 --> 03:41.786
Elizabeth, you secret little slut.

03:41.872 --> 03:43.455
He's married.

03:43.540 --> 03:46.007
And we are just friends.
Now, get back to work.

03:46.042 --> 03:48.460
I need the research on the
class action by 5:00 p.m.

03:48.545 --> 03:50.512
Slut.

03:50.547 --> 03:52.597
Be more professional.

03:58.305 --> 04:00.054
Hmm.

04:21.378 --> 04:22.744
Hmm.

04:27.050 --> 04:28.583
Whew.

04:35.725 --> 04:37.509
"Liz, so nice to get this.

04:37.594 --> 04:40.595
"Thought of you while listening
to an old Chet Jenks LP,

04:40.680 --> 04:42.013
"'Sweet and Succulent.'

04:42.098 --> 04:44.649
"Look it up. XX, Santa."

04:49.773 --> 04:51.656
Look what I found.

04:52.909 --> 04:55.360
"Jackpot."

04:59.282 --> 05:02.116
"Which one of these is not like the other?"

05:09.342 --> 05:12.260
Do you know anyone who likes cookies?

05:17.634 --> 05:21.886
"Save some for me. I'll bring the milk."

05:24.140 --> 05:26.641
"Hey, Liz, I'll be in town
for a work thing next week.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.309
"Staying at the Grafton.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.862
"No pressure, but if you're around,

05:30.947 --> 05:33.031
might be fun to grab a drink."

05:33.116 --> 05:34.315
- Jessica.
- Huh?

05:34.401 --> 05:35.650
Can you enter my office, please?

05:35.702 --> 05:37.952
- Sure.
- Close the door.

05:37.988 --> 05:40.071
Is everything all right?

05:47.497 --> 05:49.497
Santa Claus is coming to town.

05:49.549 --> 05:50.665
OMG.

05:50.717 --> 05:51.966
He wants me to meet him

05:52.002 --> 05:53.301
at his hotel for a drink.

05:53.336 --> 05:54.502
You have to go.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.970
Of course I can't go.

05:56.006 --> 05:57.555
He's married.

05:57.641 --> 05:59.507
Liz, this is Santa we're talking about.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.675
Literally thousands of girls

06:00.760 --> 06:02.510
would kill to be in your position.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.430
Okay, well...

06:05.515 --> 06:07.065
that's not who I am.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.915
Liz.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.501
You look even more
stunning than I remember.

06:26.536 --> 06:28.286
Thank you.

06:31.875 --> 06:33.174
Can I get you something to drink?

06:33.209 --> 06:34.175
I'll have a white wine.

06:34.210 --> 06:35.376
Cocoa with rum

06:35.428 --> 06:36.628
and a candy cane twist.

06:38.632 --> 06:39.964
Are you Santa?

06:40.050 --> 06:41.799
No. But I get that a lot.

06:44.020 --> 06:46.304
Sometimes you just wanna
be anonymous, you know?

06:46.389 --> 06:47.805
Like when you're having drinks

06:47.891 --> 06:50.141
with a woman who's not your wife.

06:52.362 --> 06:55.229
I can't stop thinking about you, Liz.

06:55.315 --> 06:58.066
I've been going crazy.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.867
But you're married.

06:59.903 --> 07:01.986
Well, yes, technically I'm still married,

07:02.072 --> 07:04.539
but it's a dead marriage, Liz.

07:04.574 --> 07:06.407
And it has been for years.

07:08.244 --> 07:10.745
We don't even sleep in
the same room anymore.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.380
It's a friendship. It's a partnership.

07:12.415 --> 07:16.250
We run a holiday together.

07:16.302 --> 07:18.970
Liz...

07:19.055 --> 07:21.055
that's all it is.

07:23.259 --> 07:25.927
I want you, Liz.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.262
Santa, we can't.

07:28.314 --> 07:29.313
We can't.

07:33.236 --> 07:36.938
But if we could...

07:36.990 --> 07:38.439
what would it be like?

07:41.778 --> 07:44.779
First, I'd caress your sugarplums

07:44.831 --> 07:47.281
with my fingertips

07:47.367 --> 07:49.417
over your blouse.

07:49.452 --> 07:51.669
Just a taste of what's to come.

07:51.755 --> 07:56.624
And then I'd peel off your clothes

07:56.710 --> 07:59.343
and I'd pour cold, cold milk

07:59.429 --> 08:02.046
all over your hot, hot body.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.854
Then I would order you

08:09.939 --> 08:12.306
to untoggle my suit with your teeth

08:12.358 --> 08:17.145
while I tickle your anus
with the ball of my cap.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.980
I'd tell you to get on top,

08:19.065 --> 08:22.617
and you'd ride me like a sleigh...

08:26.322 --> 08:29.123
My hot balls pressed against your thigh.

08:29.159 --> 08:30.491
They're so full of jelly.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.994
That's enough.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.580
Take me upstairs.

08:58.804 --> 09:01.722
I got something going out.

09:04.727 --> 09:06.777
- I hear you, but Jeffrey...
- Hey, Jimmy.

09:06.862 --> 09:09.896
Do you want to be right
or do you want to win?

09:09.982 --> 09:11.698
All right, then we're
going to do it my way.

09:11.734 --> 09:13.734
- Ah.
- Hey, Liz.

09:13.786 --> 09:14.735
A group of us are headed to O'Donnell's

09:14.787 --> 09:15.736
if you want to grab a beer.

09:15.788 --> 09:16.954
My treat.

09:17.039 --> 09:18.155
I'm sorry, I've got plans.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.207
Working late again?

09:20.242 --> 09:22.826
Actually, I'm meeting up with my boyfriend.

09:22.911 --> 09:24.661
Oh.

09:24.747 --> 09:26.580
Okay.

09:26.665 --> 09:28.498
Have fun.

09:30.302 --> 09:31.668
Okay...

09:31.754 --> 09:34.504
- Ah!
- Oh...

09:44.149 --> 09:46.400
Wowee.

09:46.435 --> 09:47.567
Oh, my God.

09:47.603 --> 09:51.104
To all a good night.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.489
Ah.

09:52.574 --> 09:54.241
You know, out of, like, a 4.1.

09:54.276 --> 09:55.692
Oh, you mean above the most...

09:55.778 --> 09:57.411
Yeah, above the most you that can get.

09:57.446 --> 09:58.662
But the university wouldn't let them.

09:59.948 --> 10:02.199
Elizabeth?

10:02.284 --> 10:03.867
Is that you?

10:03.952 --> 10:05.335
Oh, my God. Hi, Mom.

10:05.421 --> 10:07.754
Hi, hi. Whatty whoa?

10:07.790 --> 10:09.506
- Oh.
- What are you doing here?

10:09.591 --> 10:12.009
I'm sorry, am I not allowed
to come into the city?

10:12.094 --> 10:15.178
- Uh, you are allowed.
- Who's your friend?

10:15.264 --> 10:19.132
Sorry, hi. This is Santa.

10:19.218 --> 10:21.601
- Hello.
- Santa, this is my mother.

10:21.637 --> 10:24.638
We're working on this crazy case.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.390
Must be quite the case.

10:26.475 --> 10:28.475
Oh, I'm so sorry, listen,
I have to take this.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.144
Mrs. Greenberg, it was
such a pleasure to meet you.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.696
Liz, I'm going to call you this week,

10:32.781 --> 10:34.481
and we're going to touch
base about that case.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.650
Ab... solutely.

10:36.735 --> 10:37.617
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:38.821 --> 10:40.203
- Liz.
- Yeah.

10:40.289 --> 10:42.706
- That man is married.
- Look, Mom,

10:42.791 --> 10:45.158
they're not even sleeping
in the same room anymore.

10:45.210 --> 10:46.827
Oh, honey.

10:46.912 --> 10:50.497
Do you know that all men
tell their mistresses that?

10:50.549 --> 10:52.916
Stop, Mom... I'm not in the
mood for a lecture right now.

10:53.001 --> 10:55.335
I know about these things,
Liz... they do not end well.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.504
Mom, just shut up, okay?

10:57.589 --> 11:00.223
I'm not a child, and you don't
know anything about it anyway.

11:10.903 --> 11:12.519
Oh, shit.

11:12.571 --> 11:13.770
Oh, shit, oh shit, oh shit.

11:18.026 --> 11:19.443
I'm sorry, do we have an appointment?

11:19.528 --> 11:20.410
I don't need an appointment.

11:20.496 --> 11:21.695
I'm his wife.

11:21.780 --> 11:23.246
Oh, I see.

11:23.332 --> 11:24.781
You know, for a lawyer,

11:24.867 --> 11:28.335
you... are not... very smart.

11:31.039 --> 11:33.540
You know, it's illegal to
open someone else's mail.

11:33.592 --> 11:36.176
Mmm. It was sent to my house.

11:36.211 --> 11:39.012
Hey, Liz, do you have the...

11:39.047 --> 11:40.881
Look, I know you probably think

11:40.966 --> 11:42.766
that you and Santa have something special,

11:42.851 --> 11:44.634
but let me set the record
straight... you don't.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.887
If I were you, I would save
what dignity I have left

11:46.972 --> 11:48.221
and end it now.

11:48.307 --> 11:49.689
This seems like a conversation

11:49.725 --> 11:51.274
you should be having with your husband.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.110
I'm just trying to help
you, woman to woman.

11:53.195 --> 11:54.895
The only thing you're trying
to do is get me out of the way,

11:54.947 --> 11:57.614
because I think you know
deep down that Santa loves me.

11:57.699 --> 11:59.316
That's a nice lie for you to tell yourself.

11:59.401 --> 12:03.153
I suppose that's how you
justify behaving like a whore.

12:03.238 --> 12:05.789
Well, you're wrong about us.

12:05.874 --> 12:08.575
Really? Prove it.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.915
You all right?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.750
Mm-hmm.

12:16.802 --> 12:18.084
You know, clear my schedule.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.252
I've got work to do.

12:24.426 --> 12:26.059
Hey, honey, listen.

12:26.094 --> 12:27.594
I'm so sorry just to
pop in on you like this,

12:27.646 --> 12:30.680
but I wanted to tell
you this face-to-face.

12:30.766 --> 12:33.266
- Mmm?
- Vicki knows about us.

12:33.352 --> 12:35.402
I know. She came to my office.

12:35.437 --> 12:38.188
Shit.

12:38.273 --> 12:42.108
She didn't make it seem
like such a... dead marriage.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.277
Liz, honey.

12:44.329 --> 12:45.946
This time together,

12:46.031 --> 12:50.584
it's been the most
incredible time of my life,

12:50.619 --> 12:53.954
but I've been talking with my wife,

12:54.006 --> 12:56.006
and I think it's time that you and I

12:56.091 --> 12:58.875
were honest with each other
about what this really is.

12:58.961 --> 13:00.343
Wait, before you go any further,

13:00.429 --> 13:02.179
- I have something for you.
- No, Liz, honey,

13:02.264 --> 13:04.431
please don't make this more
difficult than it needs to be.

13:04.466 --> 13:06.099
Let's just...

13:06.134 --> 13:08.969
Please, just open it.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.143
Oh, you didn't.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.702
This could be us every night.

13:25.787 --> 13:27.120
Every night?

13:27.155 --> 13:28.488
Oh, okay, Liz.

13:28.574 --> 13:29.789
Just like we talked about, okay?

13:29.825 --> 13:31.908
Do you love me?

13:31.994 --> 13:32.959
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:32.995 --> 13:34.628
Just send the train, Liz.

13:34.663 --> 13:36.663
Send the train.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.999
Tell me you'll leave her and
I'll give you anything you want.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.418
I'll leave her. Just... send the train.

13:41.503 --> 13:42.919
I love you. I'll leave her.

13:43.005 --> 13:44.638
I love you. I'll leave her.

13:44.673 --> 13:45.922
I love you.

13:47.009 --> 13:48.975
Aaah!

13:53.478 --> 13:55.215
I can't believe I'm walking
down the street with you

13:55.267 --> 13:56.624
in the middle of the day.

13:56.744 --> 13:59.186
I can't believe I'm out with
the prettiest girl in the city.

13:59.221 --> 14:01.605
Mmm.

14:01.690 --> 14:02.639
Mmm.

14:04.393 --> 14:05.442
Hey, what's up?

14:06.946 --> 14:07.945
How's it going?

14:09.231 --> 14:10.397
Hi.

14:23.746 --> 14:24.962
Just ignore it.

14:32.338 --> 14:34.805
How is it?

14:34.890 --> 14:36.390
It's okay.

14:36.425 --> 14:38.141
You know, Vicki used to put, like,

14:38.227 --> 14:41.762
a little bit of chili in the oil.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.680
Kind of gave it a little bit more flavor.

14:46.268 --> 14:47.818
Ah, look, forget about it.

14:50.072 --> 14:52.522
Did you look for a job today?

14:52.608 --> 14:54.358
Yeah, I mean, there's nothing.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.862
Really, nothing?

14:58.948 --> 15:02.833
Liz, honey, I-I used to run
Christmas, for Christ sakes.

15:02.918 --> 15:06.086
I mean... what, am I
supposed to now go and...

15:06.121 --> 15:09.089
clean bathrooms at Starbucks?

15:09.124 --> 15:11.592
No one's suggesting that
you work at Starbucks.

15:20.519 --> 15:23.937
Honey.

15:23.973 --> 15:27.808
Honey, you're gulping.

15:27.893 --> 15:30.644
Oh, that... I'm sorry that offends you.

15:40.623 --> 15:42.623
Ah...

15:42.658 --> 15:45.158
Ah. I'm sorry.

15:45.244 --> 15:46.994
It's okay.

15:48.998 --> 15:50.664
It's just not, uh,

15:50.716 --> 15:53.667
it's just not working.

16:47.473 --> 16:48.889
May I help you?

16:48.974 --> 16:50.691
Uh...

16:52.478 --> 16:54.394
I think you've got the wrong holiday.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.563
Tricks are for Halloween.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.949
This... is her?

16:59.034 --> 17:01.368
I thought you said she was skinny.

17:01.403 --> 17:04.287
I'm so sorry, Vicki.

17:04.373 --> 17:08.625
I made a huge mistake, and
you are correct to hate me.

17:08.711 --> 17:09.910
You better tell me what you came to say

17:09.994 --> 17:11.712
before I lose my patience with you.

17:11.747 --> 17:13.547
It's Santa.

17:13.582 --> 17:14.964
He's not jolly anymore.

17:15.050 --> 17:17.000
I found his toy sack last night,

17:17.086 --> 17:18.919
and it was just filled with empty bottles.

17:19.003 --> 17:21.755
Well, I guess that's your
problem now, isn't it?

17:21.839 --> 17:23.723
He's not the same man without you.

17:23.759 --> 17:25.474
She's not the same, either.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.260
Okay, Janice, that's enough.

17:27.346 --> 17:28.678
She used to walk around the shop caroling

17:28.764 --> 17:30.097
and spreading cheer,

17:30.182 --> 17:32.232
but now she's so on edge.

17:32.267 --> 17:33.567
Buttercup short wrapped a present,

17:33.602 --> 17:35.936
and she told him he was worthless.

17:36.021 --> 17:37.320
Janice, shut your mouth.

17:37.406 --> 17:39.406
No, you need to hear this.

17:39.441 --> 17:41.274
You and Santa have always
been better together

17:41.360 --> 17:42.859
than you are apart.

17:42.945 --> 17:44.277
- You need each other.
- No, no, no.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.747
I do not need that lying,
cheating son of a bitch.

17:46.782 --> 17:48.832
I can do Christmas all by myself.

17:48.917 --> 17:51.451
Of course you can do
Christmas alone, Vicki.

17:51.537 --> 17:54.671
The question is, do you want to?

17:56.542 --> 17:58.125
You can lie to me all you want.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.794
You can lie to this bitch all you want,

18:00.879 --> 18:02.763
but you can't lie to yourself.

18:02.798 --> 18:04.548
You love Santa.

18:04.633 --> 18:06.349
He humiliated me.

18:06.435 --> 18:08.435
How am I supposed to
take him back after that?

18:08.470 --> 18:10.303
You guys can get through
it if you work together.

18:10.389 --> 18:11.772
I know you can.

18:11.807 --> 18:14.141
How?

18:14.226 --> 18:17.227
I heard somewhere that you're a fighter.

18:30.793 --> 18:33.160
She certainly doesn't keep house, does she?

18:33.212 --> 18:35.712
Vicki.

18:35.798 --> 18:37.497
I can't believe you're actually here.

18:37.549 --> 18:40.667
I'm so sorry, baby.

18:40.752 --> 18:43.753
I'm so sorry about everything.

18:43.839 --> 18:48.008
I'm sorry to you too, Liz.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.143
Please take me... take me back.

18:51.847 --> 18:53.847
I'll change.

18:53.899 --> 18:57.350
Oh, God, I promise.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.986
What do you... What do you say?

19:00.022 --> 19:03.406
I say you look like shit.

19:03.492 --> 19:05.442
Microwave burritos?

19:05.527 --> 19:08.161
What, is she trying to kill you?

19:08.197 --> 19:10.413
Damn, you're a fat [bleep].

19:10.499 --> 19:12.666
But...

19:12.701 --> 19:14.201
you're my fat [bleep].

19:18.841 --> 19:20.457
I love you, Santa.

19:20.542 --> 19:23.877
Oh, Santa, oh.

19:23.962 --> 19:26.012
Let's get you home and
get a good meal into you.

19:26.048 --> 19:27.714
God, I missed you.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.216
I missed you so much.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.051
Tell it to the elves.

19:31.136 --> 19:34.054
Let me grab all my shit.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.272
Is Rudolph here?

19:35.357 --> 19:36.606
Mm-hmm. He's here.

19:42.856 --> 19:45.033
Santa and Mrs. Claus's vow renewal ceremony

19:45.153 --> 19:47.411
was said to be the event of the season.

19:47.531 --> 19:50.139
Guests included Anna
Wintour, the Kardashian Wests,

19:50.225 --> 19:52.091
and over 300 elves.

19:52.143 --> 19:54.227
They dined on a meal
of sugarplums, licorice,

19:54.262 --> 19:56.062
and gingerbread houses.

19:56.097 --> 19:58.097
Vicki Claus looked stunning as usual,

19:58.149 --> 20:01.651
and sources say Santa could
not keep his eyes or hands

20:01.736 --> 20:03.352
off his beautiful bride.
