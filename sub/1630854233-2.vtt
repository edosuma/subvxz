00:01.523 --> 00:03.307
<i>Previously on
"Reginald the Vampire..."</i>

00:03.394 --> 00:04.439
You really like her,
don't you?

00:04.526 --> 00:05.875
Her name is Sarah.

00:05.962 --> 00:07.137
Maybe you should do
something about that.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.225
Are you busy Friday night?

00:08.312 --> 00:10.010
No, no, I'm not busy.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.011
I think it would be fun
if we went out.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.490
Sure.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.014
How have you never been
on a date before?

00:15.450 --> 00:17.147
Leave him alone!

00:17.234 --> 00:18.627
I can fix this, Reggie.

00:18.714 --> 00:19.932
I had the weirdest dream
last night.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.151
No, you're not dreaming.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.631
I'm a mother------- vampire!

00:22.718 --> 00:24.111
Being a fat vampire,

00:24.198 --> 00:25.547
that's gonna cause
some problems

00:25.634 --> 00:26.765
within the vampire community.

00:26.852 --> 00:27.853
I'm going to be
like this forever.

00:27.940 --> 00:28.941
Vampires can't glamour

00:29.029 --> 00:31.074
other vampires, all right?

00:31.161 --> 00:32.554
<i>You need to feed, man.</i>

00:32.641 --> 00:34.643
But I don't want
to kill anyone.

00:34.730 --> 00:35.774
You don't have to.

00:35.861 --> 00:36.949
We need to break up.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.256
I reject your imaginary
break up

00:39.343 --> 00:41.389
and think that you
and I need to have

00:41.476 --> 00:43.173
an open and honest conversation

00:43.260 --> 00:44.827
about what's going on
between us.

00:47.003 --> 00:50.659
Could I come in now please?

00:50.746 --> 00:52.182
Okay.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.228
Okay.

01:00.495 --> 01:03.237
Um, the best way to have
an honest conversation

01:03.324 --> 01:07.545
is to just dive in
without hesitation or fear.

01:09.156 --> 01:13.508
Are you... all right?

01:15.249 --> 01:16.815
Reginald?

01:20.602 --> 01:23.605
- Better now.
- Good.

01:23.692 --> 01:26.303
Because, um...
- Stop right there.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.044
Don't come any closer.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.785
Can't break up
if we were never together.

01:29.872 --> 01:32.701
That's a fair point,
semantically sound.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.659
We're on the same
wavelength here.

01:34.746 --> 01:37.488
I feel like there's something
that you're not telling me,

01:37.575 --> 01:41.710
and Reginald,
you can tell me anything.

01:41.797 --> 01:44.626
I know how you could
assume that,

01:44.713 --> 01:48.586
but there's just some things
a man can't share.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.762
Try me.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.084
What's the story,

02:08.171 --> 02:09.129
morning glory?

02:14.830 --> 02:17.702
<i>Sarah, there is nothing
I'd rather do</i>

02:17.789 --> 02:20.357
than be with you,

02:20.444 --> 02:22.229
but I can't.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.150
Because...

02:30.237 --> 02:33.196
the timing's wrong,
or the gods are against us,

02:33.283 --> 02:36.765
or the stars are out
of alignment.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.810
Probably all of those things
at the same time.

02:41.596 --> 02:44.164
<i>We can't be together.</i>

02:57.264 --> 03:00.528
No, no!
Sarah, what was I thinking?

03:00.615 --> 03:05.054
I was wrong!
I don't care about the stars.

03:05.141 --> 03:09.972
Of course we can be together.
We have to be.

03:10.059 --> 03:13.802
There's nothing
in the world I want more.

03:15.369 --> 03:18.589
However, in the interest
of full disclosure,

03:18.676 --> 03:21.070
I have to tell you something,
so brace yourself

03:21.157 --> 03:22.985
because, again, fully aware

03:23.072 --> 03:27.076
of what a shocker
this is gonna be, but...

03:27.163 --> 03:29.992
the thing I wasn't telling you,

03:30.079 --> 03:34.170
my big, bold,
impossible secret is...

03:36.128 --> 03:38.261
I'm a mother------- vampir--

03:38.348 --> 03:40.437
No, no, I'm still
not entirely on board

03:40.524 --> 03:42.570
with that catchphrase.

04:00.718 --> 04:01.937
She didn't hear
a word I said?

04:02.024 --> 04:03.373
Sorry, no.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.767
How did you even know
she was here?

04:05.854 --> 04:08.291
The sire bond, man.
It's like an alarm bell.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.727
What you feel, I feel.

04:09.814 --> 04:12.817
You don't wanna feel
what I feel.

04:12.904 --> 04:13.992
Understood.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.560
You made her go.

04:16.647 --> 04:19.259
I just put a different
thought in her head.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.522
What will she remember
from tonight?

04:21.609 --> 04:22.827
I went a little deeper
than that.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.612
What?

04:24.699 --> 04:26.614
No first date
for her to miss,

04:26.701 --> 04:28.224
no reason for her to come here,

04:28.311 --> 04:29.965
no conversation once she did,

04:30.052 --> 04:31.880
and no catchphrase.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.795
Is Sarah gonna remember
that she likes me?

04:33.882 --> 04:35.144
Well, I didn't tell her
not to, man,

04:35.231 --> 04:36.537
but it's an inexact science.

04:36.624 --> 04:38.843
So summing up again,

04:38.930 --> 04:40.715
body issues for an eternity,

04:40.802 --> 04:42.847
unable to control
my most basic urges,

04:42.934 --> 04:45.676
and unfit for human interaction
including, of course, romance.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.461
Well, hey, hey,
none of that is permanent

04:47.548 --> 04:49.506
except for the body part.

04:49.593 --> 04:52.204
Something
to look forward to then.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.989
Look, you need to feed,
Reggie, okay?

04:54.076 --> 04:56.861
Nothing changes until you get
your teeth into someone.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.517
What if I don't?

05:00.604 --> 05:02.693
Well, it won't kill you,
but some very inconvenient

05:02.780 --> 05:04.129
shit will start to happen.

05:04.216 --> 05:07.219
Define "inconvenient shit."

05:07.307 --> 05:10.005
Drop your fangs, bite,
and drink.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.572
Oh, and don't forget,

05:11.659 --> 05:14.618
make them forget
after it's over.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.446
I've never
glamoured anyone before.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.056
Well, it's a part
of your nature now.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.147
Then come with me.
Show me how to feed.

05:23.801 --> 05:26.021
- I can't do that.
- Why?

05:26.108 --> 05:27.762
Sorry, tradition.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.591
There comes a time when baby
birds gotta leave the nest,

05:30.678 --> 05:32.375
even if they need
a little push.

05:32.462 --> 05:35.596
- I am not a baby bird.
- No.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.902
No, you're
a mother------- vampire!

06:09.325 --> 06:10.805
Welcome to the Slushy Shack.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.372
How may I help you?

06:12.459 --> 06:14.417
Welcome to Slushy Shack.
How may I help you?

06:16.550 --> 06:18.334
What?

06:22.556 --> 06:25.167
- Todd wanted to have a--
- Whoa.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.429
How about a little warning
next time?

06:26.516 --> 06:28.779
Sorry.
Sometimes I violate

06:28.866 --> 06:31.521
people's personal space.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.088
And...

06:33.175 --> 06:34.437
Todd wanted to have
a serious talk with you

06:34.524 --> 06:36.091
about your attitude,
but I convinced him

06:36.178 --> 06:38.136
I might be more efficient
at getting to the bottom

06:38.223 --> 06:41.226
of what's bugging you.
- Oh? Okay.

06:41.313 --> 06:42.837
Fair enough.

06:42.924 --> 06:45.579
What's up with the attitude,
buddy boy?

06:45.666 --> 06:48.408
Okay, how is this
more efficient?

06:48.495 --> 06:51.323
I employ the direct approach
when necessary.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.064
Spill the beans.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.937
I'm worried, and I don't know
what to do about it.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.721
Go on.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.680
There's this friend of mine.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.856
I'm worried about her health.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.467
- She's sick?
- Not exactly.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.469
So this is not
a health problem?

07:06.556 --> 07:08.384
It's--it's complicated.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.778
I'm trying to figure out
how to help her.

07:10.865 --> 07:14.608
I mean, let's say that she's
not entirely okay,

07:14.695 --> 07:16.958
but has no idea she's not okay.

07:17.045 --> 07:18.612
Like you're sick
and don't know it.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.004
Maybe waiting
until things get better

07:20.091 --> 07:22.833
is my best option,
but I can't wait.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.705
Waiting for things to get
better is glass half full

07:24.792 --> 07:26.228
foolishness
that never wins the day.

07:26.315 --> 07:28.317
Right.

07:28.404 --> 07:31.320
Okay, well, good talk, Ashley.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.757
I needed this.
Thanks, I guess.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.282
Okay.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.807
One, pull yourself together
when you're at the register

07:39.894 --> 07:41.199
and never bark
at a customer again.

07:41.286 --> 07:42.723
Got it.
Attitude check.

07:42.810 --> 07:45.726
Two, you're weirdly indirect
about this,

07:45.813 --> 07:47.902
but I'm sensing genuine emotion
in between the lines

07:47.989 --> 07:49.643
when it comes to this anonymous
friend of yours,

07:49.730 --> 07:52.602
so I'm gonna say
what I told you at the start.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.126
"What's with the attitude,
buddy boy?"

07:55.213 --> 07:59.348
Employ the direct approach
when necessary.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.357
Dude, they slapped me.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.011
Wh--

08:10.098 --> 08:11.578
what the f--

08:26.506 --> 08:29.334
Hi.
- Hey.

08:30.945 --> 08:34.383
- Hey?
- Reginald.

08:36.472 --> 08:39.257
Sorry I'm late.
It was so weird.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.216
I forgot how to get here.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.697
I mean, well, I didn't forget,

08:43.784 --> 08:45.916
but, like, I did.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.440
So what did you do
last night?

08:50.007 --> 08:52.096
Not much. Nothing.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.926
I don't know.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.362
I was just thinking about
what we were talking about

08:57.449 --> 08:59.930
at work yesterday.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.628
Oh.

09:01.715 --> 09:05.283
Well, I don't really remember
what we talked about.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.850
Follow-up question.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.548
Have you been
on any dates lately?

09:10.506 --> 09:14.075
No.
I don't think so.

09:14.162 --> 09:17.295
I mean, no, I haven't.

09:19.036 --> 09:22.474
But, uh, why would you
ask me that?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.912
Um, nothing,
just collegial interest

09:24.999 --> 09:27.001
in your social calendar.

09:27.088 --> 09:28.829
Oh.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.180
What's the story,

09:32.267 --> 09:36.271
morning glory?
- Okay.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.665
That's a Blur song, right?

09:38.752 --> 09:41.668
What do you see
when you look at me?

09:41.755 --> 09:43.365
Are you okay?

09:43.452 --> 09:45.846
I'm Reginald.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.718
I'm Sarah.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.373
Is there a reason you're acting
like we never met?

10:08.999 --> 10:10.566
Gah!

10:11.959 --> 10:13.264
Have we met?

10:13.351 --> 10:15.005
You killed my brother.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.398
I'm sorry. You're gonna
have to be more specific.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.008
You killed Isaac.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.749
Again, my apologies.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.621
The funny thing is I actually
killed more than one Isaac,

10:21.708 --> 10:23.274
so fill in the details for me.

10:23.361 --> 10:24.754
Are we talking about Dallas Ike

10:24.841 --> 10:27.104
or maybe the Isaac
I killed in Berlin?

10:41.989 --> 10:44.165
Come on, man.
- You killed my brother.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.819
Which we established,
and--and did I mention

10:45.906 --> 10:47.168
how sorry I was about that?

10:49.866 --> 10:51.520
Hey, hey, hey!

10:51.607 --> 10:53.217
Look, if we're gonna fight,

10:53.304 --> 10:54.828
first we gotta establish
some rules, right?

10:54.915 --> 10:56.438
We're not gonna fight.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.135
I'm gonna rip your head
off your body.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.094
No, no, no, I-I like my head.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.487
It's been on my body
for over 75 years.

11:02.574 --> 11:05.490
Look, Isaac wasn't a bad guy.

11:05.577 --> 11:08.015
He was just mean and--
and a little vain,

11:08.102 --> 11:11.409
and in a lot of ways,
that's worse, right?

11:11.496 --> 11:13.063
He didn't have to die.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.935
He wasn't really
a threat to me.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.589
In truth, he had his hands up
to surrender.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.723
But he hurt
a friend of mine, okay?

11:20.810 --> 11:23.204
And my feeling was, I was
putting Isaac down for good.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.815
Ugh.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.578
Maurice, let me in!

11:49.665 --> 11:51.058
I'm not a baby bird!

11:51.145 --> 11:53.887
I'm a man!
Now let me in!

11:55.410 --> 11:56.454
Hey!

11:56.541 --> 11:58.630
He's not in here.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.024
- Oh.
- You're Reginald.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.679
- Who--who are you?
- I'm Mike.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.073
Do you--I-I need help.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.944
Sounds like it.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.250
Do you know
where Maurice went?

12:09.337 --> 12:11.600
Well, he comes and he goes.

12:11.687 --> 12:14.559
Do you--do you know
when he'll be back?

12:14.646 --> 12:17.606
Why don't you come inside,
and we'll wait together?

12:17.693 --> 12:19.434
Thank you.

12:31.054 --> 12:33.230
- You're late.
- Yeah, sorry.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.667
I ran into somebody.

12:38.888 --> 12:41.195
Angel's Blood,
you're going in hot.

12:41.282 --> 12:44.154
- It's what I need.
- Going after her.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.547
I never took you
for the death wish type--

12:45.634 --> 12:47.592
Look, can you get it for me
or not?

12:47.679 --> 12:49.769
Sure, but, I mean,

12:49.856 --> 12:51.379
you gotta understand
the risks involved.

12:51.466 --> 12:52.510
The weight of something
like this is--

12:58.647 --> 13:01.824
On the other hand,
happy to oblige.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.610
<i>It's like he erased her.</i>

13:05.697 --> 13:07.699
I mean, sure,
she remembers who I am,

13:07.787 --> 13:11.878
but what if she never remembers
how she felt about me?

13:11.965 --> 13:13.967
What if it's just
an empty space?

13:14.054 --> 13:18.275
The thing about glamouring,
the essential comes back.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.147
Sarah forgot
what she did last night,

13:20.234 --> 13:22.540
but one way or another,

13:22.627 --> 13:24.804
she'll reclaim
how she feels about you.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.719
Is there, like,
a timetable that I can consult

13:27.807 --> 13:29.112
that will let me know
when that happens?

13:29.199 --> 13:31.201
When you measure your life
in centuries,

13:31.288 --> 13:35.510
patience is a virtue.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.338
This would be a lot easier
if you could just glamour

13:37.425 --> 13:39.993
a comprehensive undead
life hack into my head.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.345
Vampires can't glamour
other vampires.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.651
Told you that.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.871
What are we talking about?

13:48.958 --> 13:50.438
Love.

13:50.525 --> 13:53.702
Love.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.838
Love is constant.
Only the names change.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.448
How you doing, Reggie?

14:00.535 --> 14:02.276
Other than thinking vampires
have a pretty convenient

14:02.363 --> 14:05.148
gestalt for love,
I'm not doing great, thank you.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.368
Reggie's special.
He just hasn't realized it yet.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.893
Hey.

14:10.980 --> 14:14.636
What's the square root
of 65,894?

14:14.723 --> 14:18.379
256.698.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.424
What's the first sentence
of the seventh chapter

14:20.511 --> 14:21.686
of the last book you read?

14:21.773 --> 14:23.471
"War and Peace."

14:23.558 --> 14:27.040
"The rustle of a woman's dress
was heard in the next room."

14:27.127 --> 14:28.911
He's smart.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.826
That's his superpower.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.523
It feels like a parlor trick.

14:32.610 --> 14:33.873
No, it's not a trick.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.700
Okay, that's function.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.441
You're exceptional.

14:37.528 --> 14:39.661
Take advantage of that.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.664
Gee, I had no idea
how amazing I was.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.798
All right,
it's time for you to go.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.931
Feed or fall apart.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.193
Hey.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.718
Drop your fangs, bite,
and drink.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.329
Make them forget
when it's over.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.287
Exactly.

15:32.670 --> 15:33.976
Ugh, come on.
What's wrong with me?

15:36.109 --> 15:37.806
Come on.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.462
Almost there.

15:41.549 --> 15:42.724
Ah.

15:57.565 --> 15:58.609
Oh, f--

16:03.136 --> 16:05.703
So the baby bird returns
to the nest.

16:07.879 --> 16:10.317
No, that's not Reginald.

16:10.404 --> 16:11.927
Back so soo--

16:13.537 --> 16:14.843
Hi, I'm Angela.

16:17.324 --> 16:18.890
Maurice home?

16:22.807 --> 16:24.548
Come on in.

17:36.881 --> 17:39.188
What the--

17:39.275 --> 17:40.798
Nice night.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.497
I love a warm breeze.

17:43.584 --> 17:46.717
- You about to jump me?
- Not exactly.

17:46.804 --> 17:50.025
You think I'm prey
for a dude like you?

17:50.112 --> 17:51.461
That's actually closer
to the truth

17:51.548 --> 17:52.593
than you might understand.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.075
Educate me, little man.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.426
I want to drink your blood.

17:59.513 --> 18:04.083
- Excuse me?
- I need to drink your blood.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.867
- Get away from me.
- I could break your neck

18:05.954 --> 18:07.129
before you even knew
what hit you.

18:07.216 --> 18:08.870
Only thing's neck
you can break off

18:08.957 --> 18:11.525
is a bucket of fried chicken.
- Make it easy on yourself.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.788
Come with me,
and I will let you live.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.051
I don't think so.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.097
You--you don't know
who you're messing with.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.663
I am vampyre.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.840
I-I own the night.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.538
I'll--I'll pay you $25.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.540
$25 for my blood?

18:26.627 --> 18:29.325
$50, but we'd have to go
to an ATM first.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.675
Hang on. If you a vampire,
where are your damn fangs?

18:33.547 --> 18:35.026
Ah-ah.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.160
Ah.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.207
They're temporarily unavailable.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.514
I don't know
who you think you're fooling,

18:44.601 --> 18:46.690
but vampires are all
Patterson and shit.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.518
Where your cheekbones, fool?

18:48.605 --> 18:50.912
Well, in truth, vampires come
in all shapes and sizes now--

18:50.999 --> 18:52.827
I'm done talking, understand?

18:52.914 --> 18:54.481
Comic-Con is next month.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.699
Listen to me!

18:55.786 --> 18:57.310
Oh, I'm listening,
mother------.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.929
So...

19:11.106 --> 19:13.413
How long has it been

19:13.500 --> 19:15.763
since you two last saw
each other?

19:17.678 --> 19:20.202
A very long time.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.467
I saw you in New York

19:24.554 --> 19:27.340
the night David Dinkins got
elected mayor.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.733
I didn't see you.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.736
No. No, you didn't.

19:36.697 --> 19:40.527
I hear you met
Isaac's brother, Erich.

19:40.614 --> 19:42.050
Man needs
a weapons designation,

19:42.137 --> 19:44.444
not a name.

19:44.531 --> 19:49.013
Well, I just wanted
you to know face-to-face,

19:49.100 --> 19:53.366
personally, that Erich will
no longer be a problem.

19:53.453 --> 19:56.020
You have my word.

19:56.107 --> 19:58.632
Well, Angie,
if we got your word...

20:02.810 --> 20:04.115
I smell home cooking.

20:06.248 --> 20:09.686
- Etouffee.
- Oh.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.775
Like Maurice's
mother used to make.

20:15.257 --> 20:19.392
Well, it was nice
meeting you, Angela.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.350
Is there anything else
we can do for you tonight?

20:21.437 --> 20:23.178
I should go.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.876
It was lovely to meet you too.

20:25.963 --> 20:28.270
Mike, is it?

20:36.452 --> 20:39.542
I really didn't mean
to intrude.

20:39.629 --> 20:42.153
I just wanted to see you
in the flesh

20:42.241 --> 20:43.894
after all of these years.

20:45.592 --> 20:49.596
Don't be a stranger,
young soldier.

20:52.163 --> 20:55.515
I remember we were
gonna break 'em.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.430
Who you breaking now?

20:57.517 --> 20:59.258
Wait and see.

21:34.641 --> 21:35.903
Late for work?

21:35.990 --> 21:37.687
Something like that.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.603
Chocoholic Blast,

21:40.690 --> 21:42.866
just a pinch
of Tropical Coconut.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.564
I feel the need to feed.

21:46.174 --> 21:48.045
You and me both.

22:02.146 --> 22:03.147
Reginald?

22:07.804 --> 22:09.676
I appreciate
the customer service,

22:09.763 --> 22:12.896
but I'm perfectly capable
of riding home by myself.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.034
There's a creepy vibe
to what's happening here.

22:20.121 --> 22:23.167
You get that, right?

22:23.254 --> 22:25.256
I-I can't do this.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.217
I can't.

22:29.304 --> 22:31.524
Can't do what?

22:35.397 --> 22:36.877
Back the---- up!

22:36.964 --> 22:38.008
Language.

22:38.095 --> 22:40.837
Dude, you have fangs.

22:40.924 --> 22:42.752
They have a mind
of their own.

22:42.839 --> 22:44.928
Out they come, in they go.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.539
I'm helpless to control them,

22:46.626 --> 22:48.367
and you'd think
after all this time--

22:48.454 --> 22:49.542
I-I mean, it hasn't
been a ton of time--

22:49.629 --> 22:50.847
Are you a vampire?

22:54.155 --> 22:56.636
Regrettably, yes.

22:56.723 --> 22:57.811
But you're fat.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.682
I don't know why
that's relevant,

22:59.769 --> 23:01.031
but everyone keeps
harping on it,

23:01.118 --> 23:02.903
so hey, thank you.

23:02.990 --> 23:05.079
I'm fully aware
of my body issues.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.605
You were gonna feed on me.

23:09.692 --> 23:11.607
It felt like
my last available option.

23:11.694 --> 23:14.480
Well, I'm not
letting you do that.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.482
As you wish.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.788
I forbid you entry
into my home.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.529
Sounds about right.

23:20.616 --> 23:23.358
Be gone,
undead creature of the night.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.708
Is that really necessary?

23:35.152 --> 23:37.807
Reginald, are you okay?

23:37.894 --> 23:39.766
No.

23:39.853 --> 23:42.769
What are you gonna do?

23:42.856 --> 23:46.642
I'm gonna sit here
and wait for the sun to rise.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.862
- But won't that burn you up?
- If I'm lucky.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.429
And sorry in advance
for the mess.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.953
I'll probably wash
right off the sidewalk.

23:55.172 --> 23:57.218
What's it like
being a vampire?

23:57.305 --> 23:59.525
How does it look?

24:02.528 --> 24:04.051
Who made you?

24:04.138 --> 24:06.836
Long story.

24:06.923 --> 24:09.665
Well, JFTR,
I know all about vampires,

24:09.752 --> 24:12.320
so I won't let you glamour me.
- Not to worry.

24:12.407 --> 24:13.800
The last time I tried
to glamour someone,

24:13.887 --> 24:16.367
I got punched in the face.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.673
Will you promise
not to bite me

24:17.760 --> 24:20.154
if I get you something
good to eat?

24:20.241 --> 24:21.503
Yes.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.200
How do I know
I can trust you?

24:23.287 --> 24:25.551
I'm a vampire,
not an asshole.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.335
Right.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.428
Weak as a kitten too.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.780
Are--aren't you gonna
invite me in?

24:37.867 --> 24:40.087
I was just kidding
about you not entering.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.132
Pretty sure that's just
something they made up on TV.

24:42.219 --> 24:44.091
I mean, think about it.

24:48.835 --> 24:49.966
Mom will be back soon.

24:50.053 --> 24:51.359
That's when
her second job ends,

24:51.446 --> 24:52.882
so you have to eat and run.

24:52.969 --> 24:55.885
And she leaves you
all alone like this?

24:55.972 --> 24:57.887
Perfectly capable
of taking care of myself.

24:59.715 --> 25:01.935
Not sure if this will help,
but it can't hurt.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.635
There's blood in there, right?

25:06.722 --> 25:08.681
Technically, it's not blood.

25:08.768 --> 25:12.467
It's just water
and a protein called myoglobin.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.316
My grandmother says
chew your food 32 times

25:35.403 --> 25:37.623
before you swallow.

25:37.710 --> 25:40.713
Oh.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.628
That was an emergency.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.499
Pretty gross, to be honest.

25:44.586 --> 25:47.241
Sorry. Mm.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.941
Well...

25:52.028 --> 25:54.683
I'm gonna go

25:54.770 --> 25:56.859
before your mom comes home.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.818
This is the weirdest
fairy tale ever told.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.473
Uh, will you come back
and visit?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.650
I mean,
outside of the Slushy Shack.

26:04.737 --> 26:06.477
Mom's got extra long
hours all week,

26:06.565 --> 26:09.132
so I get bored.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.220
Plenty of steaks
in the freezer.

26:10.307 --> 26:12.353
I'll thaw some out.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.616
- It's a date.
- Still a little creepy.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.966
I'm a vampire.
Creepy's my brand.

26:17.053 --> 26:19.273
Up high, big guy.

26:27.629 --> 26:28.761
Oops.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.782
What is it?

26:49.869 --> 26:51.871
An invitation.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.311
It's from Angela.

27:33.216 --> 27:36.089
What the what?

27:40.571 --> 27:42.965
What the hell
are we doing here?

27:43.052 --> 27:44.532
You hate this woman.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.534
After everything
she did to you?

27:46.621 --> 27:50.016
If I'm gonna destroy Angela,
end her for good,

27:50.103 --> 27:51.713
then I need to know everything
there is to know

27:51.800 --> 27:53.628
about her world.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.238
It's like she taught me,

27:55.325 --> 27:58.372
knowledge is power.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.905
- Have a great night.
- Have a good night.

28:12.473 --> 28:15.345
I'm giving Reginald ten minutes
to get here,

28:15.432 --> 28:18.740
suit up, and get to work,

28:18.827 --> 28:20.481
or else...

28:21.961 --> 28:23.440
Hi, welcome to Slushy Shack.

28:23.527 --> 28:24.833
How can I help you?
- Hi, welcome to Slushy Shack.

28:51.599 --> 28:52.992
Reginald.

28:54.907 --> 28:56.299
Whoa.

28:56.386 --> 28:57.823
I'm having a bad skin day.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.041
I'd say so.

28:59.128 --> 29:01.478
Maybe you should
get that looked at?

29:01.565 --> 29:03.872
Yeah, first thing
in the morning.

29:03.959 --> 29:05.744
Okay.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.137
Uh, Todd's getting
pretty impatient,

29:08.224 --> 29:10.574
so you should probably
get out front

29:10.661 --> 29:13.055
or see a dermatologist?

29:13.142 --> 29:16.624
Uh, whatever you think is best.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.104
Did you ever hear
of the story

29:18.191 --> 29:21.063
of the ant and the horse?

29:21.150 --> 29:22.630
The what now?

29:22.717 --> 29:24.893
The ant and the horse.

29:24.980 --> 29:28.505
I...can't say that I have.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.770
There's this horse,

29:31.857 --> 29:33.815
and it's totally beautiful

29:33.902 --> 29:37.123
a-and the envy
of all other horses.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.734
So a pretty good horse.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.388
Best horse possible.

29:41.475 --> 29:45.261
And every day, the horse
runs past this anthill,

29:45.348 --> 29:49.570
and an ant waits
for the horse every day.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.964
Now, the horse doesn't know
the ant exists,

29:52.051 --> 29:56.316
but for the ant, the horse
is the most important thing

29:56.403 --> 29:59.493
in the world, so it waits,

29:59.580 --> 30:02.017
but the horse just runs on by.

30:02.104 --> 30:05.151
Not sure how I feel about
this whole insect-horse story.

30:05.238 --> 30:08.850
And then, one day,
the horse stops to graze,

30:08.937 --> 30:10.721
like, right next
to the anthill,

30:10.809 --> 30:13.594
and the ant who's been waiting

30:13.681 --> 30:16.075
and hoping for so long,

30:16.162 --> 30:17.293
this is his moment.

30:17.380 --> 30:20.862
He--he walks up to the horse,

30:20.949 --> 30:23.343
and there's so much
he wants to tell her,

30:23.430 --> 30:25.954
a tidal wave of feeling,

30:26.041 --> 30:28.827
but then he notices
that the horse is about

30:28.914 --> 30:31.699
to eat arrowgrass.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.440
- Is that bad?
- The worst.

30:33.527 --> 30:34.920
- Oh.
- Arrowgrass has a high

30:35.007 --> 30:37.357
cyanide content, totally
poisonous for the horse.

30:37.444 --> 30:38.662
Oh, that's not good.

30:38.749 --> 30:41.883
So the ant races
right up her nose,

30:41.970 --> 30:44.146
like, deep up in there,

30:44.233 --> 30:47.933
and the horse rears back and sneezes,

30:48.020 --> 30:50.500
shaking its head,
and it just trots off,

30:50.587 --> 30:52.198
leaving the grass behind.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.548
What happened to the ant?

30:54.635 --> 30:58.334
He shot right out of her nose
and bounced off a tree,

30:58.421 --> 31:01.294
but he limps back to his hill,

31:01.381 --> 31:05.037
and that's where he waits
every day

31:05.124 --> 31:09.476
for the horse to return because...

31:09.563 --> 31:14.046
he'll save her life
again and again

31:14.133 --> 31:16.396
if that's what it takes.

31:16.483 --> 31:18.789
So...

31:18.877 --> 31:22.489
slushy counter
or emergency dermatologist?

31:25.448 --> 31:26.362
Let's go back to work.

31:36.068 --> 31:40.899
Dude, you look like
the shit a shit took.

31:40.986 --> 31:43.771
All right, maybe you should
just take a sick day.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.642
Uh, hey, excuse me?

31:45.729 --> 31:48.602
Could I grab--
- Just one second, sir.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.996
That hat is not regulation,
and I'm gonna have

31:51.083 --> 31:53.520
to ask you to remove
the sunglasses pronto.

31:53.607 --> 31:56.088
Welcome to the Slushy Shack.
How may I help you?

31:58.046 --> 32:00.483
Big guy, you need to feed,
and you need to feed now.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.659
Tell me something
I don't know.

32:14.193 --> 32:15.585
Your face looks like
toxic waste.

32:15.672 --> 32:17.196
I know, thank you.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.501
Here you go.

32:20.286 --> 32:21.722
Feed on Todd.

32:21.809 --> 32:23.506
What?
No, that's disgusting.

32:23.593 --> 32:24.899
He's young.
He's fit.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.162
I bet his blood tastes awesome.

32:27.249 --> 32:30.035
Regi-wide, you stink.

32:31.645 --> 32:32.776
Feed on Todd.

32:35.388 --> 32:37.738
What the hell happened
to your face?

32:39.305 --> 32:40.480
There you go.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.557
Thanks for coming.
We'll see you again real soon.

35:24.644 --> 35:27.125
Yep. Thanks.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.910
Uh, maybe I should check
on Reginald.

35:29.997 --> 35:32.130
You want to check,
check on your own time.

35:33.870 --> 35:36.264
Welcome to Slushy Shack.
How can I help you?

35:36.351 --> 35:37.744
Hey.

35:37.831 --> 35:39.006
What are you
doing back there?

35:39.093 --> 35:39.963
That break room...
- I can help you.

35:40.050 --> 35:41.051
Is for employees only.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.053
Reginald is very, very sick.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.577
Tell someone who cares, okay?

35:48.102 --> 35:49.451
I think he's dead.

35:54.978 --> 35:56.937
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

35:59.940 --> 36:03.857
Dude, get your ass out of here.

36:03.944 --> 36:05.380
Whatever mess you're making,

36:05.467 --> 36:07.469
I do not want to clean it up,
you understand me?

36:12.605 --> 36:14.302
Oh.

36:14.389 --> 36:15.956
You're disgusting.

36:19.133 --> 36:20.700
Oh.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.745
Something's wrong
with your eyes, man.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.532
What the hell happened
to your mouth?

36:26.619 --> 36:29.404
Je--Jesus!

36:29.491 --> 36:31.276
You know what?
That does it, okay?

36:31.363 --> 36:32.929
You're fired.

36:36.542 --> 36:39.327
What's with the eye----, friendo?

36:39.414 --> 36:41.503
Listen to me!

36:41.590 --> 36:43.331
What?

36:43.418 --> 36:44.941
Listen to me.

36:45.028 --> 36:46.595
Listen, listen, listen.

36:46.682 --> 36:48.771
I'm going to bite your neck
and drink your blood,

36:48.858 --> 36:50.904
and that fills you
with joy and happiness.

36:50.991 --> 36:53.211
It is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to you,

36:53.298 --> 36:54.951
and when I'm done,

36:55.038 --> 36:57.040
you will forget
that it ever happened.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.406
Ooh.

37:43.609 --> 37:46.220
What did you do?

37:46.307 --> 37:48.048
You drugged me?

37:49.702 --> 37:51.356
Where's Mike?

37:57.579 --> 37:59.581
Why?
- Aw, baby,

37:59.668 --> 38:02.454
you know the answer to that.

38:09.330 --> 38:11.245
Todd?

38:17.686 --> 38:19.209
Hello, Sarah.

38:21.777 --> 38:25.477
What do you say we get
ourselves back to work, huh?

38:31.483 --> 38:33.049
Okay.

38:36.488 --> 38:38.185
Nice.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.900
Maurice.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.316
Comfortable?

39:22.403 --> 39:24.666
A coffin, seriously?

39:24.753 --> 39:26.015
And you always said

39:26.102 --> 39:27.365
I didn't have a sense of humor.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.802
Do I look amused?

39:29.889 --> 39:30.890
Where am I?

39:30.977 --> 39:32.239
You're in a wooden box

39:32.326 --> 39:34.720
about to incinerate,

39:34.807 --> 39:36.809
but if it's any consolation,
as your maker,

39:36.896 --> 39:39.725
I will know the exact moment
when you burn.

39:39.812 --> 39:41.204
I'll feel it.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.381
I made you in Oakland.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.818
You were such a beautiful boy,

39:45.905 --> 39:49.343
but your hunger for revenge
almost ended us,

39:49.430 --> 39:52.346
and I followed you
all the way home

39:52.433 --> 39:54.609
where I begged you
to leave your family behind,

39:54.696 --> 39:56.306
but you would not listen to me.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.612
Do not speechify me

39:57.699 --> 39:59.266
before you shove me
into this fire.

39:59.353 --> 40:01.747
And now you show up in Ohio
without any good reason

40:01.834 --> 40:03.183
except for that's where I am.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.315
Did you think
I wouldn't see you coming?

40:05.403 --> 40:06.839
Angel's Blood?

40:06.926 --> 40:09.145
What the hell were
you thinking, young soldier?

40:09.232 --> 40:11.800
Is that how you honor
the gift that I gave you?

40:11.887 --> 40:14.063
I gave you forever,

40:14.150 --> 40:17.719
and that vampire you made
is an abomination.

40:17.806 --> 40:20.635
Perfection is what keeps
our nation safe,

40:20.722 --> 40:23.072
and not only
is he less than perfect,

40:23.159 --> 40:25.466
but he is defective, grotesque,

40:25.553 --> 40:27.990
and an insult to our purity.

40:30.297 --> 40:33.126
Reginald Andres will not
survive the night.

40:34.736 --> 40:37.260
Angela! Angela!

41:10.685 --> 41:12.557
Oh, my sweet Lord. <i></i>

41:12.644 --> 41:16.299
Don't mind the rotund vampire
of very little importance.

41:16.386 --> 41:18.214
He's just passing through.

41:18.301 --> 41:20.216
<i>- Angela!</i>
- It's like I was never here.

41:20.303 --> 41:21.957
Who are you?

41:22.044 --> 41:24.090
Nobody, trust me on that.

41:24.177 --> 41:26.179
Everyone thinks so.

41:26.266 --> 41:28.703
You don't belong here.

41:28.790 --> 41:29.748
I mean,
if you think about it,

41:29.835 --> 41:32.011
does anyone really belong here?

41:32.098 --> 41:34.274
You're lying to me.

41:34.361 --> 41:36.015
Again, not to argue
semantics, but--

41:36.102 --> 41:37.625
I'm gonna rip your head off.

41:49.332 --> 41:50.812
Geronimo!

42:10.745 --> 42:12.268
Listen to me!

42:12.355 --> 42:13.705
Listen, listen, listen.

42:18.579 --> 42:20.494
Maurice!

42:20.581 --> 42:22.931
You won't believe
what I just did.

42:28.284 --> 42:29.285
My damn feet are on fire!

42:29.372 --> 42:31.200
Got it.
