00:01.557 --> 00:03.007
Previously in The IT Crowd:

00:03.017 --> 00:06.170
Douglas received a love potion from
a mysterious blind man in the desert.

00:06.200 --> 00:10.440
Enraptured with the lovely Jen Barber,
an employee of Reynholm Industries,

00:10.450 --> 00:13.880
he administers the potion in
the hope of enslaving her heart.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.200
But when Douglas drinks
the concoction by mistake,

00:16.210 --> 00:19.560
which turns out to be Rohypnol,
he becomes incredibly aroused,

00:19.570 --> 00:22.720
even though Rohypnol would
really only make you tired.

00:22.730 --> 00:27.080
Jen locks him in his office with Moss
and Roy, with whom he attempts to
achieve sexual congress.

00:27.090 --> 00:30.880
An enraged Jen embarks on a lengthy
legal process using brilliant lawyer

00:30.898 --> 00:33.120
Jon Rergen,
a friend of her aunty's.

00:33.131 --> 00:37.725
After months of legal wrangling an
amicable agreement is finally reached.

01:10.089 --> 01:12.881
You're robbing me blind, Jen.

01:12.896 --> 01:16.880
Sign here, here, here.

01:16.896 --> 01:20.842
Yeah, and I reckon I know where to sign
on a sexual harassment settlement,
thank you.

01:25.408 --> 01:28.921
I've got to thank you, Jan,
for not taking this matter any further.

01:28.936 --> 01:32.563
Not only does that show great
maturity but also a... Is she asleep?

01:32.575 --> 01:34.160
I'm not asleep.

01:34.175 --> 01:35.012
All right, all right.

01:35.057 --> 01:36.492
It's not just the money,
you know.

01:36.535 --> 01:37.120
I know.

01:37.136 --> 01:38.843
There's a principle involved.

01:38.855 --> 01:40.603
Parting with the money
was painful enough,

01:40.618 --> 01:45.681
but the electric pants I have to wear at
work so I don't become aroused, they're
also painful.

01:45.698 --> 01:49.483
Excuse me,
I'm just charging them.

01:49.496 --> 01:53.642
Don't say anything that will
get me going, either of you.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.482
Does it hurt,
you know, when you?

01:56.498 --> 01:58.123
It's like being tased
in the balls. Tea?

01:58.138 --> 01:59.961
No, thank you.

01:59.976 --> 02:04.521
Like being tased in the balls,
except painful.

02:04.537 --> 02:07.921
So, Jen, what are you going
to do with your £500.

02:07.935 --> 02:09.841
Don't know.

02:09.858 --> 02:12.323
I still feel we could've got more,
you know.

02:12.336 --> 02:14.283
Now, Jen,
we've been through this.

02:14.296 --> 02:15.883
He tried to use Rohypnol on me.

02:15.898 --> 02:18.402
I thought it was
a magic potion.

02:18.415 --> 02:22.162
Anyway, if this went to court
it'd be your word against mine

02:22.175 --> 02:26.320
and who are they going to believe?
A woman or an Englishman?

02:26.335 --> 02:27.801
Oh, up yours!

02:27.817 --> 02:30.400
BUZZINF

02:30.418 --> 02:32.842
That wasn't even sexy.

02:32.856 --> 02:34.482
These pants are broken.

02:41.166 --> 02:44.681
Sorry to bother you, mate. I've just
found out my mum's been taken into

02:44.697 --> 02:47.723
hospital. Normally my sister would go
but she's just moved to Australia.

02:47.736 --> 02:49.022
Australia?

02:49.036 --> 02:51.331
I really need to get down there.
My car's broken down...

02:51.377 --> 02:53.521
OK, look, here's 50p.

02:53.538 --> 02:58.282
It's all I've got and it's 50p
more than that story deserved.

03:01.125 --> 03:04.603
I can't believe you
got more than me.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.761
Why wouldn't we?
Jen, we were violated too.

03:06.776 --> 03:09.481
Violated?! He chased
you around the table.

03:09.497 --> 03:10.842
He kissed Moss.

03:10.856 --> 03:14.201
Right on the lips, apparently.

03:14.216 --> 03:15.683
Don't you remember?

03:15.697 --> 03:19.121
I don't remember anything.
I went to Moss's happy place.

03:19.135 --> 03:21.121
You two are useless.

03:21.137 --> 03:23.563
If we'd stuck together we
might've made real money.

03:23.576 --> 03:26.001
£550 is not to be
sniffed at, Jen.

03:26.018 --> 03:29.723
No, and neither is £560.

03:29.736 --> 03:35.683
If that's the kind of money I can make,
I'm going to start dressing even
more provocatively.

03:35.698 --> 03:37.522
Yeah, we you can save
some of that for Freddy.

03:37.535 --> 03:39.040
What's this?

03:39.057 --> 03:42.760
Freddy, that bloke that did the charity
thing where he tied the balloons to
the chair.

03:42.776 --> 03:43.963
Oh, yeah.

03:43.976 --> 03:45.682
Such a lovely idea.

03:45.696 --> 03:50.280
Floating from London to
Glasgow to promote optimism.

03:50.296 --> 03:53.083
Anyway, there's a collection
for his wife and kids,

03:53.097 --> 03:56.522
so you'd both better cough up.

03:56.535 --> 04:00.163
Moss, what would be
an appropriate amount

04:00.177 --> 04:03.401
to give to Freddy's
wife and kids?

04:03.417 --> 04:05.360
I suppose normally about £5

04:05.375 --> 04:08.603
but seeing as we just
got all that money, £50?

04:08.618 --> 04:11.682
That seems fair. Let's split the
difference and call it a tenner.

04:15.966 --> 04:17.841
PHONE

04:18.606 --> 04:19.959
Hello?

04:21.007 --> 04:23.000
Hello?

04:23.015 --> 04:25.362
Douglas, I know this is you.

04:25.378 --> 04:27.003
BUZZING

04:27.018 --> 04:29.763
'ARGH! Jesus,
this bloody thing.'

04:31.927 --> 04:35.680
Are you all right, Olive?
You look a bit peaky.

04:35.698 --> 04:38.683
Yes, I-I'm,
I don't feel up to it any more.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.160
I feel sort of dizzy
all of a sudden.

04:41.175 --> 04:43.200
Well, you're terrifically old.

04:46.127 --> 04:49.161
But don't worry,
not long now till you're at peace.

05:07.047 --> 05:09.560
I've done it. Oh, I've done it.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.641
I'm up against the boss now.

05:11.656 --> 05:15.400
Oh, it's a giant
spider shooting out

05:15.418 --> 05:17.483
all these little baby spiders.
That's brilliant.

05:17.497 --> 05:20.000
I'm going nowhere down here.

05:20.016 --> 05:22.523
Nowhere. I'm going to,
ooh, oh, where's Moss?

05:22.536 --> 05:24.600
I'm going to finish
this bitch off, Moss.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.242
It's a dead end.

05:26.257 --> 05:29.162
They don't come any deader.

05:29.175 --> 05:31.643
OK, sweetcheeks,
here comes the pain.

05:33.805 --> 05:37.323
You guys,
do you even need a relationship manager?

05:37.335 --> 05:39.560
Stay down! Stay down, bitch!

05:42.605 --> 05:45.322
I'm dead!

05:45.338 --> 05:49.680
Oh, no, exactly, Jen, no offence,
but I object to the whole idea that

05:49.698 --> 05:51.403
we even need management,
like we're a

05:51.418 --> 05:54.240
pair of nitwits that don't know
how to take care of ourselves.

05:54.258 --> 05:56.361
It's...it's insulting
is what it is.

05:58.165 --> 06:00.443
Yeah, yeah,

06:00.458 --> 06:03.680
I suppose you're right.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.360
Sandwich. Oh, right.

06:06.377 --> 06:09.322
Coffee. Oh, no, no, no.

06:09.338 --> 06:12.721
Got you!
That one's empty, this is the real one!

06:12.735 --> 06:15.080
I've been planning that for ages.
The look on your face!

06:29.966 --> 06:30.883
Jen?

06:30.895 --> 06:32.801
Yeah?

06:32.818 --> 06:34.481
Don't come in here for a bit.

06:38.647 --> 06:40.920
Why haven't you put
on a clean T-shirt?

06:40.938 --> 06:42.481
I don't have a spare.

06:42.495 --> 06:45.040
Well, someone's looking
for help on 10, so...

06:45.055 --> 06:46.001
No, no, Moss can do it.

06:46.017 --> 06:48.482
Moss can't do it,
he's slightly concussed.

06:52.207 --> 06:53.643
Yeah, all right, I'll go.

06:53.707 --> 06:57.320
Er, I won't be here this afternoon,
I've...I've got a job interview.

06:57.335 --> 07:01.121
Oh, OK, good for you, Jen.

07:01.137 --> 07:03.882
Seriously, we don't need a manager,
it's a non-job.

07:03.898 --> 07:07.203
So you go out there
and you knock 'em dead.

07:07.216 --> 07:10.080
Hello, Jen.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.960
It's Moss. From work?

07:24.808 --> 07:27.083
For God's sake.

07:29.528 --> 07:30.962
Twats!

07:38.926 --> 07:41.400
What happened?
She just collapsed.

07:41.418 --> 07:44.000
I've phoned for an ambulance.
Give us your jacket, mate.

07:44.018 --> 07:45.283
What?

07:45.296 --> 07:47.412
She looks cold,
I want to put it round her shoulders.

07:47.456 --> 07:49.920
She doesn't look cold.

07:49.938 --> 07:52.200
What? Just give us
your jacket, man.

07:52.215 --> 07:55.883
She's fine!
You're fine, aren't you, Olive?

07:57.285 --> 07:58.201
She's moving about.

08:00.126 --> 08:02.360
Oh, and she's talking.

08:02.378 --> 08:05.243
That's it,
keep the spirits up, Olive.

08:05.255 --> 08:06.402
I'm cold!

08:06.415 --> 08:08.403
It's all in your head, Olive.

08:08.418 --> 08:09.482
Your jacket, man.

08:09.497 --> 08:11.482
What? Come on!

08:14.088 --> 08:16.242
Hurry up.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.281
Thank you.

08:22.525 --> 08:25.123
Come on. Here we go.

08:41.525 --> 08:42.760
Hell's teeth!

08:42.770 --> 08:48.445
I'm not aroused, it's only cars.
God damn these electric sex pants.

08:54.444 --> 08:59.521
Isn't it so funny and interesting
that I don't have a shirt on?!

09:01.168 --> 09:06.800
Oh, hello, let's all make
hilarious comments about it.

09:06.819 --> 09:10.241
Everyone, excuse me, er,

09:10.257 --> 09:12.880
as you know,
they found Freddy's body yesterday.

09:15.765 --> 09:20.441
There's nothing I can say that will
make that fact any less horrible.

09:20.456 --> 09:26.440
But perhaps we can bow our heads
for a minute and think about Freddy

09:26.457 --> 09:28.721
and remember what
he meant to us.

09:42.007 --> 09:45.083
Hey, everybody, look at me!

09:45.096 --> 09:52.122
Let's get it over with, let's all
have a big laugh at the topless man.

09:54.445 --> 09:58.643
Look at me. Ooh, look at me,
I have no shirt, where's my clothes?

10:00.685 --> 10:03.720
Ooh look at these pants.
Am I sexy?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.521
Sexy in my nakedness.

10:05.538 --> 10:10.240
We're trying to have a
minute's silence for Freddy,

10:10.255 --> 10:14.362
they found his body yesterday.
If you can give us a couple of minutes.

10:37.606 --> 10:39.681
I work here.
I fucking work here.

10:39.695 --> 10:43.483
Ow. OK. All right. Ow.

10:45.248 --> 10:46.680
Oh, OK...

10:52.207 --> 10:54.402
I work in IT!

10:54.415 --> 10:56.643
My pass is in my jacket.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.320
My pass is in my jacket.

11:01.165 --> 11:02.643
This is madness!

11:03.845 --> 11:05.483
I work here!

11:05.496 --> 11:07.041
It's madness !

11:31.077 --> 11:33.113
Lovely cup of tea.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.110
Ahh, thank you.

11:36.195 --> 11:40.030
Well, I have to say,
I like what I see, Jen.

11:40.046 --> 11:43.072
You're young,
ambitious, intelligent,

11:43.085 --> 11:45.871
just the sort of person
I like to have around.

11:45.887 --> 11:51.511
Ha, ha, ha. Well, I'm no Stephen
Hawking, don't get me wrong.

11:51.525 --> 11:54.590
But you can't work
as long as I have

11:54.605 --> 11:59.111
in IT without having a pretty
firm grasp of the essentials.

11:59.127 --> 12:00.953
You know,

12:00.968 --> 12:03.470
what exactly does IT stand for?

12:03.488 --> 12:06.790
I've often wondered,
but I've never thought to ask.

12:12.637 --> 12:15.433
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

12:15.446 --> 12:17.830
What does IT stand for?

12:17.846 --> 12:19.671
What does it stand for?

12:21.638 --> 12:23.710
What doesn't it stand for?

12:23.727 --> 12:28.150
Yes, yes,
but what does it stand for?

12:28.166 --> 12:30.152
It stands for...

12:30.165 --> 12:32.193
It stands for...

12:33.798 --> 12:35.070
Commitment.

12:35.086 --> 12:41.313
It stands for audacity,
it stands for courage in the face of...

12:41.328 --> 12:44.070
Yes, yes.
I can see what you're getting at.

12:44.085 --> 12:48.712
But the specific letters -
I, T. What do they stand for?

12:48.725 --> 12:51.151
What do you think
they stand for?

12:51.168 --> 12:53.632
No. Perhaps I'm not
making myself clear.

12:53.645 --> 12:55.630
I'm don't want
an interpretation.

12:55.645 --> 12:59.511
I really don't know what the
letters actually stand for.

12:59.525 --> 13:01.990
So let's start with the I.

13:02.005 --> 13:04.112
What does the I stand for?

13:04.126 --> 13:07.871
I need to wee-wee.
I mean go to the toilet,

13:07.886 --> 13:10.152
I need to go to
the toilet, sorry.

13:10.165 --> 13:13.632
I don't normally say "wee-wee",
it's just I'm bursting.

13:26.277 --> 13:29.430
Hello, Roy speaking.

13:29.448 --> 13:31.231
What? Moss?

13:31.247 --> 13:33.430
You're concussed,
you need a doctor.

13:33.448 --> 13:36.392
Who is this? Roy?
Wait, it couldn't be Roy, I'm Roy.

13:36.405 --> 13:37.591
What does IT mean?

13:37.605 --> 13:39.030
What?

13:39.047 --> 13:40.432
IT, what does it mean?

13:40.448 --> 13:42.432
You don't know what it means?

13:42.446 --> 13:44.672
No, I never thought to ask.

13:44.685 --> 13:46.153
This must be Jen.

13:46.165 --> 13:47.671
Yes.

13:47.687 --> 13:48.992
Hello, Jen.

13:49.007 --> 13:49.553
Hello.

13:49.568 --> 13:51.073
How may I help you?

13:51.088 --> 13:53.591
Oh! Tell me what IT means.

13:53.608 --> 13:55.113
Absolutely.

13:57.757 --> 13:59.271
Well?

13:59.285 --> 14:01.230
Very well, thank you.
How are you?

14:01.248 --> 14:04.111
Just stay with me for
this simple question.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.993
Jen, I'm just going to
put you on speakerphone.

14:07.006 --> 14:08.433
No, don't hang...

14:11.118 --> 14:13.792
Jen, you are now
on speaker phone.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.833
Jen?

14:18.356 --> 14:19.511
Hello, Jen?

14:19.525 --> 14:21.030
PHONE RINGS

14:21.046 --> 14:22.713
Jen, can you bear with me.

14:22.727 --> 14:25.752
I've got someone
trying to get through.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.030
Roy speaking.

14:27.046 --> 14:28.031
You hung up on me.

14:28.048 --> 14:30.031
Jen, hold on,
I've got Jen on the other line.

14:30.047 --> 14:31.473
No, you can't.

14:31.488 --> 14:35.030
Jen, can I call you back,
I've got Jen on the other line.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.112
Jen, sorry about that.

14:37.125 --> 14:42.391
Chicken in a basket,
it's been all ruddy go today.

14:42.407 --> 14:44.312
Now, how may I help you?

14:44.325 --> 14:46.993
What does IT mean?

14:48.556 --> 14:50.432
You know, computers,

14:50.446 --> 14:52.951
something to do with
computers, probably.

14:52.966 --> 14:56.472
Computers? That's
not really my area.

14:58.757 --> 15:01.592
Jen I'd love to help you
but it's a real pain,

15:01.608 --> 15:05.110
I seem to have forgotten
everything I know about computers.

15:05.127 --> 15:07.471
How can you forget
everything, Moss?

15:07.488 --> 15:09.550
Maybe it isn't everything.

15:12.276 --> 15:14.553
No, it's definitely everything.

15:38.916 --> 15:42.712
Excuse me, can I trouble you
for 50 pence for a phone call?

15:44.355 --> 15:47.911
Excuse me, mate,
I'm sorry to bother you, but, er,

15:47.928 --> 15:52.393
my mate threw coffee all over me and
then this old woman stole my jacket,

15:52.447 --> 15:55.750
and they chucked me out of
the building where I work.

15:55.767 --> 16:00.391
And now I just need 50p for a phone
call so I can get back to work.

16:13.597 --> 16:16.190
Oh, that's better.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.271
Good, good.

16:18.285 --> 16:20.831
Now, er, where were we?

16:20.846 --> 16:24.750
Oh, God, I can't remember.
I hate it when that happens.

16:24.765 --> 16:27.432
Wow, is this a wooden desk?

16:27.446 --> 16:31.753
Oh, no, I remember,
you were going to tell me what IT means.

16:31.765 --> 16:32.830
Right.

16:33.916 --> 16:36.513
I don't know what it means,
all right?

16:36.525 --> 16:39.790
I never thought to...
it didn't really affect me

16:39.807 --> 16:41.673
as I'm too busy
managing one man

16:41.686 --> 16:45.353
whose idea of an adult night out
is Laser Quest and pornography.

16:45.368 --> 16:47.672
And another who collects wires.

16:47.686 --> 16:50.632
Have you heard Guided By Voices?
They're a band.

16:50.647 --> 16:51.233
No.

16:51.247 --> 16:52.390
I have.

16:52.405 --> 16:55.193
I've heard everything
they've ever done.

16:55.205 --> 16:57.351
They're good,
I'm a bit of a fan now.

16:57.366 --> 16:58.630
Isn't that good?

16:58.647 --> 17:01.912
I shouldn't even
know who they are.

17:01.925 --> 17:04.032
They've turned me
into one of them.

17:04.046 --> 17:07.392
I am one of them.

17:08.955 --> 17:11.792
That's why you need me.

17:11.806 --> 17:14.471
I am your conduit,

17:14.486 --> 17:21.311
I am your
bridge. Ich...bin...ein...Nerd.

17:26.278 --> 17:27.990
Welcome aboard.

17:32.275 --> 17:33.391
BUZZING

17:33.408 --> 17:34.350
Oh, oh.

17:37.998 --> 17:39.591
How can that be erotic?

17:39.605 --> 17:41.432
Good God!

17:41.448 --> 17:43.230
Get me IT.

18:16.238 --> 18:17.233
BUZZING

18:22.435 --> 18:24.790
You there, computer man.
Fix my pants.

18:26.558 --> 18:27.753
I beg your pardon.

18:27.767 --> 18:30.351
Pull down my trousers
and do your job.

18:52.196 --> 18:53.713
Roy?

18:53.726 --> 18:54.951
Jen?

19:01.277 --> 19:02.312
Jen!

19:04.035 --> 19:05.152
Jen!

19:06.758 --> 19:08.910
Oh, Jen!

19:08.926 --> 19:10.951
Oh!

19:12.118 --> 19:13.311
It's been horrible!

19:13.328 --> 19:14.351
Ahh.

19:14.366 --> 19:18.391
Horrible. The worst
two hours of my life.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.071
Oh.

19:24.115 --> 19:25.872
All right.

19:25.888 --> 19:28.190
Hello, everybody, and welcome

19:28.208 --> 19:31.752
to this our first inter-faith
tour of Reynholm Industries.

19:34.395 --> 19:38.630
I thought we'd start with the IT
department because, to be honest,

19:38.647 --> 19:42.150
we do tend to forget about them,
buried down in the basement.

19:42.165 --> 19:44.070
And they really
are lovely guys.

19:44.087 --> 19:46.250
Let's go in and say hello.

19:46.267 --> 19:47.403
But I don't know what it is.

19:47.448 --> 19:50.153
Just pull that thing,
fiddle about with it.

19:57.717 --> 19:58.670
Fuck off!

20:04.316 --> 20:05.271
Try that wire.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.712
Who are you?

20:15.836 --> 20:19.351
Free at last,
I could get to like this.

20:19.368 --> 20:23.350
Just the job, good work.
Hmmm, nice and loose.

20:23.367 --> 20:25.711
I'm in my happy place,
I'm in my happy place.

20:25.726 --> 20:27.591
I'm in my happy place.

20:27.606 --> 20:29.551
I'm in my happy place.
I'm in my happy place.

20:47.516 --> 20:48.233
Hello.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.271
Hello, June.

20:49.288 --> 20:51.832
Jen, hello! How can I help you?

20:51.848 --> 20:53.512
I'd like to say thank you,

20:53.525 --> 20:55.631
but I have to turn
your offer down.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.550
Oh. Well,
I'm sorry to hear that. Why?

21:02.835 --> 21:04.273
Personal reasons.

21:04.286 --> 21:08.191
OK. Well, if you change your mind,
you know where I am.

21:08.206 --> 21:09.111
Thank you.

21:09.125 --> 21:12.793
Oh, by the way, did you ever
find out what IT stands for?

21:12.805 --> 21:14.072
Piss off, June.

21:18.877 --> 21:19.990
Who wants tea?

21:21.998 --> 21:26.990
