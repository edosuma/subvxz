00:09.259 --> 00:11.344
What's this?

00:13.138 --> 00:14.847
Looks like a red wire.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.057
Well. . .

00:17.643 --> 00:19.268
lt wasn't here before.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.814
lt's a computer, Dwight.
l mean, computers have wires.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.440
Yours doesn't.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.359
Doesn't it?

00:26.443 --> 00:27.694
No.

00:29.113 --> 00:31.447
lt's going in
a different direction
than the other wires.

00:31.573 --> 00:35.076
Dwight, l'm really busy.
l can't talk about this
anymore.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.212
(RlPPlNG)

00:50.300 --> 00:53.803
Dwight,
get out of here.
Just shut up, Phyllis.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.477
STANLEY:
What are you doing?

01:08.861 --> 01:13.197
l got 500 feet of
red wire at a flea market
out by Dunmore High School.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.742
Twenty bucks for
the whole spool.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.577
Crazy. What a deal.

01:22.541 --> 01:25.668
Oh ! He'll be fine.
l made it up there.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.369
What you talking
'bout, Wallace?

02:00.454 --> 02:01.954
DAVlD: Hi, Michael.
How are you?
Hi.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.080
l'm well. How are you?

02:03.165 --> 02:04.290
Very good.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.501
So, listen,
as you know,

02:06.585 --> 02:08.711
we haven't yet fiIIed
the RegionaI Supervisor job.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.713
Oh, have you not?
Correct.

02:10.798 --> 02:14.008
And I was wondering
if I couId get you to do
some of the fieIdwork

02:14.092 --> 02:16.719
that wouId normaIIy go
to the supervisor.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.972
Okay. There's an area
from CarbondaIe
to Marshbrook...

02:20.098 --> 02:21.766
Yeah.
...where we've never
done any business.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.268
There's a smaII company
there, Prince Paper.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.520
I can't get
a report on it

02:25.604 --> 02:27.647
because it's not
a pubIic company,

02:27.731 --> 02:29.941
but we've been
taIking about going
after their market,

02:30.025 --> 02:31.984
so I was hoping
you couId do some
fact-finding for me.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.152
Okay.

02:33.237 --> 02:35.196
I'II fax over some
of the things we're
Iooking for, okay?

02:35.280 --> 02:37.949
Fax? Why don't you just
send it over on a dinosaur?

02:38.450 --> 02:39.575
(CHUCKLES)

02:39.660 --> 02:40.701
This is important,
MichaeI.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.995
Oh ! Well, then
e-mail it, David.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.165
You've got no taste,
Stanley Hudson.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.667
Oh, l do.

02:47.751 --> 02:48.918
What are you guys
talking about?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.795
Some actress,
whether she's hot.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.672
Who's the gal
in question?

02:52.756 --> 02:54.006
Hilary Swank.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.467
Ah ! Hilary Swank.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.262
Not at all.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.721
She's got mean eyes.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.181
Have you seen her
with her bangs?

03:02.266 --> 03:03.683
She looks like
a monster.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.352
Guys, she is
a beautiful movie star,

03:06.436 --> 03:08.437
so maybe we should
just go to work.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.648
She is an
amazing actress.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.692
That's not the question.
She's not hot.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.527
Yeah. Thank you, Phyllis.
JlM: Okay, okay, okay.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.195
Why don't we just
put this to a vote,

03:16.280 --> 03:17.613
and then we'll be
done with it?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.407
l'm not voting.
No one cares.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.618
Who thinks that
Hilary Swank is hot?
Raise your hand.

03:24.663 --> 03:28.165
Okay, and who thinks that
Hilary Swank is not hot?
Raise your hand.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.337
Five. Five to five.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.964
Thank you,
accounting department.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.632
So, what do we do now?

03:36.842 --> 03:39.218
What if the owner
of Prince Family Paper
has a beautiful daughter,

03:39.303 --> 03:41.345
and we have to
seduce her in order
to get their secrets?

03:41.430 --> 03:42.471
l will seduce her.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.848
No, l want to seduce her.
l'll seduce her.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.142
Let me seduce her.
Michael, please.
No, no, no. l got it.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.103
You'll fall in love
with her.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.897
Yeah? So what if l did?

03:50.981 --> 03:53.357
That would take
precedence, and l would
expect your support.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.485
Okay, so let's go over
the plan again.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.529
All right. l am
a local business owner.
Mmm-hmm.

03:58.614 --> 03:59.572
l need to buy paper.
Yep.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.699
l find out everything
about their prices
and policies.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.701
Your fictitious name?
Michael Scarn.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.662
Good. l am
a paper salesman
looking for a new job.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.873
l find out everything
about their expenses
and salaries.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.458
Okay.
Then we meet
at the Denny's,

04:10.584 --> 04:13.085
and we compare notes.
No. No. l never
said Denny's. lHOP.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.795
No. l said Denny's.
lHOP. We're going to lHOP.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.964
You know how
l feel about lHOP.
Don't start.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.174
Don't. . .
You know what?
Socialist.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.468
l don't want to get
into this debate again.
Okay.

04:20.552 --> 04:21.552
l enjoy lHOP.

04:21.637 --> 04:22.637
l'll have
a cup of coffee.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.972
You will have pancakes,
and you'll like it.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.441
The store next to
them is for lease.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.692
So what?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.527
lt means they're
not expanding.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.363
Maybe they're
shrinking.
No.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.740
They could be shrinking.
No, because the
sign is centered

04:42.824 --> 04:45.576
perfectly above their store.
No sign of the sign
being moved.

04:45.661 --> 04:46.744
Ah-ha!

04:46.828 --> 04:47.954
Yep.

04:48.830 --> 04:52.833
DWlGHT: lt's lunch-time,
but no sign of anyone
coming in or out,

04:53.043 --> 04:55.378
which means they're not
taking new customers
out to lunch,

04:55.462 --> 04:56.796
which means they're not
acquiring new business,

04:56.880 --> 04:58.339
so once again,
no growth.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.425
Yeah.
There are clouds,
clouds in the sky.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.095
Means it's going to rain.
Bad for business.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.931
lt would if
they were altocumulus
and not cirrostratus.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.307
Why do. . . Okay.

05:08.392 --> 05:09.475
Michael.
Whatever.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.644
Get your clouds right.
Shut up.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.355
Okay, so you go in now.
Mmm-hmm.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.982
l'm gonna go in,
in exactly 1 0 minutes.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.818
We have never met each other.
We are complete strangers.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.236
Right.
Also, we're going
to need a signal

05:20.362 --> 05:22.446
to bolt out of there,
in case there is danger.
Fine.

05:22.531 --> 05:25.408
And that signal is
lick your lips.
Try it.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.244
No, no, no, like this.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.002
Good.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.045
Ready to do this?
Yeah.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.506
All right,
here come the sharks.

05:42.217 --> 05:45.094
(BOTH SlNGlNG JAWS THEME)

06:00.277 --> 06:03.029
MlCHAEL: ln nature,
there is something
caIIed the food chain.

06:03.113 --> 06:06.198
It is where the shark
eats the little shark,

06:06.283 --> 06:08.701
and the little shark eats
the littler shark,

06:08.785 --> 06:10.286
and so on
and so on and so on,

06:10.370 --> 06:13.330
until you get down to
the single-cell shark.

06:13.415 --> 06:16.876
So, now replace sharks
with paper companies,

06:16.960 --> 06:18.961
and that is all
you need to know
about business.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.466
MlCHAEL: Hello?
Hello.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.967
Hello.
Hi.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.636
Hi.
How can l help you?

06:27.763 --> 06:29.555
My name is Michael Scarn.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.390
l am a local
business owner,

06:31.475 --> 06:34.101
and l would like
to find out about
your company.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.937
Please come in.
Thank you.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.401
What kind of business
are you in?

06:42.486 --> 06:43.736
We're a law firm.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.490
l assume your
primary paper needs are
stationery, general office.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.159
You know,
l'll be honest with
you about something.

06:50.660 --> 06:54.747
Where l used to live,
our paper supplier had
a lot of big clients,

06:54.831 --> 06:57.249
and l just didn't
feel like a priority.

06:57.334 --> 07:02.338
So l guess my question
to you would be,

07:03.256 --> 07:04.673
how many clients
do you have?

07:05.467 --> 07:06.467
About 80.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.427
Really? That many?

07:08.512 --> 07:10.429
This doesn't seem like
a very big operation.

07:10.514 --> 07:13.766
Well, it's just me,
my wife and my son.

07:13.850 --> 07:17.269
Ah ! So, when did
you set up shop?

07:17.354 --> 07:19.939
l opened this place
after l came back
from Vietnam.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.108
Ooh, Vietnam.
l hear it's lovely.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.860
Mmm.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.696
ANDY: Each side will have
three minutes to prepare
opening arguments.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.616
Topic. Hilary Swank
is attractive.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.784
ALL: Hot.
Hot.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.035
The debate is
whether she's hot.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.286
What difference
does it make?

07:34.371 --> 07:36.956
Attractive, hot, beautiful.
We're talking about
the same thing here.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.584
Huge difference.
A painting can be
beautiful,

07:40.669 --> 07:42.128
but l don't want
to bang a painting.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.879
Okay. TMl.

07:44.256 --> 07:47.716
So, even specialty paper,
say 94 brightness,
double-bonded,

07:47.801 --> 07:50.636
you would put that on
the same truck as your
conventional stock?

07:51.012 --> 07:53.389
You sure know
a lot about paper
for a lawyer.

07:53.557 --> 07:57.852
Oh ! Well, that is
because l am a genius.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.645
(CHUCKLlNG) Oh, really?
Yes.

07:59.729 --> 08:04.358
Well, about some things,
and other things l'm just. . .
l'm very stupid.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.194
Like, watch this.
ls this the cup?

08:08.405 --> 08:11.157
ls this the cup?
ls this what
l drink out of?

08:11.241 --> 08:12.950
(LAUGHlNG)

08:13.034 --> 08:15.619
Laughter is my job.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.831
Tears are my game.
Law is my profession.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.500
Well. . .
DWlGHT: Hello.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.002
l'd like to apply
for a job.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.170
Hi.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.214
l'm afraid we're
not hiring right now.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.425
Why don't you just
get rid of this guy?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.927
ROGER: (LAUGHS)
That's my son.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.680
l'm your son now.
You can visit him
on holidays.

08:34.764 --> 08:35.973
Dwight Schrute.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.185
l'm a paper salesman at
a second-tier paper company
called Dunder Mifflin.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.104
l'm the top salesman there,
and l'm looking for
a new challenge.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.607
l would say you guys
have, what,

08:45.358 --> 08:46.567
40 high-volume clients?

08:46.651 --> 08:47.860
Try 80.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.904
(LAUGHS) Eighty,
that's nothing.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.156
l've got 90 clients
myself.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.492
Better look out.
Someone might run you
out of business.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.952
Well, l sure hope not.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.120
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)

08:58.205 --> 08:59.205
Me, too.

08:59.497 --> 09:04.210
l think all of us have
a tendency to view celebrities
as sort of mythical figures.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.629
You know,
we don't really
see them as real,

09:06.713 --> 09:08.839
so, therefore,
we don't judge them
as real people.

09:08.924 --> 09:12.009
Are you serious?
Jim, just show us
a picture.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.761
Kevin, come on.
KELLY: Yeah, shut up, Kevin.

09:13.845 --> 09:16.138
No, but he's making
all these fancy. . .

09:16.973 --> 09:18.682
lt's a gut thing.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.684
That's fair.
You know what, Kev?
Do me a favor.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.311
Why don't you
close your eyes?

09:25.440 --> 09:26.857
Okay.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.819
Now, imagine that
Hilary Swank comes into
this office for real.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.448
She walks over to you
and she says,

09:34.616 --> 09:38.118
"Kevin Malone,
l just read your
online profile,

09:38.954 --> 09:42.581
"and there's nothing l'd
rather do than make out
with you right now."

09:43.750 --> 09:47.211
Now, you tell me something,
is she hot?

09:52.842 --> 09:54.385
(ALL CHEERlNG)

09:56.388 --> 09:58.931
Does that end the debate
or is there. . .
Oh !

09:59.015 --> 10:00.224
Hey, Kev,
what are you doing?

10:00.308 --> 10:04.895
Nope. lt's, "ls she hot?"
not, "Would you do her?"

10:04.980 --> 10:06.146
Respect the game.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.857
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

10:08.942 --> 10:09.942
This close.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.319
So why are you considering
leaving Dunder Mifflin?

10:12.445 --> 10:15.114
My boss.
(LAUGHlNG)
Oh, yeah? Do tell.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.742
His insensitivity could
border on the cruel.

10:18.827 --> 10:23.372
This is a man
who does not listen to
the needs of his underlings.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.498
Hey!
He's way. . .

10:24.582 --> 10:26.292
Hey, how's the
interview going?

10:26.376 --> 10:28.460
lt's going very well.
Don't blow it.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.672
Hey, Linda, can l get
a picture of you?

10:32.299 --> 10:34.133
You want a picture of me?
l would.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.302
Could you just
stand right over here?

10:36.386 --> 10:39.972
That would be great.
Just something to
remember the trip by.

10:40.056 --> 10:43.475
Just a little
to your left.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.185
There you go. Good.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.146
Perfect.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.647
Can l have
a copy of that?

10:48.732 --> 10:49.898
Um. . .

10:50.525 --> 10:52.860
Grandma, l can't do this.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.322
What's going on?
A little homework
over here?

10:56.406 --> 10:58.240
Yeah.
Let's see if l can help.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.408
Right there.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.910
Oh ! Math.
That's not so hard.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.288
Okay. There are
four of these.
All right.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.332
lgnore the parentheses,
right?

11:06.416 --> 11:09.710
Right.
Why is this little 2
so small?

11:09.919 --> 11:13.922
lt's weird.
You just don't. . .
Just go by the "X."

11:14.007 --> 11:20.888
The "X" means times,
so that means
four times "X," 2.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.890
What is double 4?

11:23.767 --> 11:25.934
Eight.
Right. Excellent.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.271
(GlGGLES)

11:29.939 --> 11:31.523
Don't put that.

11:33.193 --> 11:37.196
Ladies and gentlemen,
even though the penis
was fake,

11:37.280 --> 11:40.074
l kept expecting
a second plot twist

11:40.158 --> 11:44.286
where we found out
that Hilary Swank
actually was a boy.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.205
Kevin.
Okay.

11:46.289 --> 11:49.333
l wasn't going to dignify
this discussion by getting
involved,

11:49.626 --> 11:51.377
and l don't even
get the discussion.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.128
Hot is a temperature,
people.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.840
But Kevin
deserves to lose
for what he said.

11:56.925 --> 12:00.803
So, yes, she's hot.
She's hot as heck.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.763
She's a female
Boris Becker.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.473
(EXCLAlMS)

12:06.684 --> 12:08.977
Well, thank you very much
for all of your help.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.938
lt's going to be
an incredibly
hard decision.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.982
Wait. Let me get
something for you here.

12:14.067 --> 12:18.445
Here's some references.
Our top clients.

12:19.364 --> 12:23.075
You call any of them.
l trust you'll hear
some good things.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

All right, thank you.

You're welcome.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.588
Excuse me, sir.
Mmm-hmm?

12:36.673 --> 12:38.173
l took the bus here
and was wondering

12:38.258 --> 12:40.342
if l could
catch a ride home
with you in your car.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.469
Of course.
Thank you very much.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.971
Thanks for your time.
Thank you very much.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.056
Thank you for your time.
l cannot wait to
contact your clients.

12:46.141 --> 12:47.933
l'll look forward
to getting your calls.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.018
ROGER: All right.
Bye now. So long.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.522
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.485
We struck
the mother lode.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.279
Come on !
Wallace is gonna freak.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.030
He is going to
absolutely freak.
All their top clients.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.532
l can't believe it.
Someone's looking out
the window.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.201
Go, go, go.
Go, peel out! Go!

13:06.870 --> 13:08.036
Shoot.
What the. . .

13:08.163 --> 13:10.414
Okay, l'll just. . .
l know.
You drove over the. . .

13:10.498 --> 13:12.875
l know. l know. Oh !
Go back.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.544
God, what was that?
That's not good.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.718
Oh, come on.
Yes!

13:22.802 --> 13:25.804
No, no, no.
She's hot, okay?

13:25.889 --> 13:29.016
Because if you are saying
that Hilary Swank isn't hot,

13:29.100 --> 13:30.726
then you're saying
l'm not hot,

13:30.810 --> 13:33.937
because obviously
l'm not as hot
as Hilary Swank!

13:35.732 --> 13:37.274
Oh.
MlCHAEL: Darn it.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.777
Oh, come on.
Oh, man.

No, no, no. We're fine.
We're fine.
DWlGHT: Yeah.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.036
You folks have done
enough already.
You don't. . .

13:49.120 --> 13:50.787
You've done more than
you could possibly know.

(SHUSHlNG)
Dwight, just. . .
Okay.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.833
You know,
we're just gonna call
a tow truck, so. . .

13:54.918 --> 13:58.003
No, a tow truck is gonna
charge you 1 00 bucks
just to take you a mile.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.838
Let me take a look.
No. No.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.965
You know,
really not necessary.
He drove over the divider,

14:02.050 --> 14:03.091
and then backed over it.
MlCHAEL: Dwight.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.510
lt caught the bumper.
l'll be right back.

grab my toolbox.

Ladies, are we prepared to
let the Kevins of the world
decide anything for us?

Anything at all?
We don't even give him
full lnternet access.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.069
Wait, what?

14:22.278 --> 14:25.656
See that? The obvious
symmetry of the face.

14:26.491 --> 14:31.495
This is a natural appeal
of the scientific standard
of koinophilia,

14:32.080 --> 14:35.499
features that are
a composite average
of many features.

14:35.959 --> 14:39.545
Yes, she's attractive,
but she's not hot.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.755
(MEN CHATTERlNG)

14:41.839 --> 14:43.715
How much longer
is this gonna take?
Put that over there.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.217
You know,
let me give you
some money for this.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.468
No. l sit all day.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.971
lt's nice working
with my hands.
Well, l. . .

14:50.265 --> 14:54.893
Oh ! Coffee.
That's too much nice.

not enough oil.

You're welcome.

Ah. Disgusting.
What is this? lnstant?

Look forward to hearing
from you about that
job application.

Bye.
Okay.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.124
Goodbye, Prince family.

for you and sharpen your

No, it's. . .

All l'm saying is Kevin's
not necessarily a feminist.

What are you. . .

16:00.293 --> 16:02.127
Dwight, what will
happen to that family

16:02.211 --> 16:04.588
if l call Wallace
and give him
this information?

16:04.672 --> 16:08.925
lt's simple.
Wallace would use that
information to destroy them.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.302
(SlGHlNG) Okay.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.928

our sales are fine.
Well.

Could be better.
Why don't we just live
and let live?

What?
Live and let live.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.560
l'm not familiar
with that expression.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.978
lt's a James Bond. . .

16:20.063 --> 16:21.146
lt doesn't make
any sense.
Okay.

Of course l'm alive.

16:22.357 --> 16:25.525
l'm not going
to make this call.
Michael, you have to.

Have you ever seen
a lioness devour
her cub?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.654
Oh, God, not this.
Have you ever seen a baboon

16:28.738 --> 16:30.489
devour its mate?

16:30.573 --> 16:32.074
Have you ever seen
a raccoon devour
a squirrel?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.326
My heart. . .
My heart says no.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.703
Your heart
is a wonderful
thing, Michael.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.413
But it makes some
terrible decisions.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.498
That's true.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.333
Yes. Gosh.
That's true.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.503

the wrong path
many, many times.

16:44.587 --> 16:45.796
Jan, Ryan.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.464
Yeah, save your
heart for love.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.717
And use your brain
for business. Right?

16:51.302 --> 16:54.930
lf we don't do this
to Prince Paper,
then someone else will.

16:55.098 --> 16:59.059
Or worse yet,
someone else
will do it to us.

more optimistic in life.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.026

17:08.444 --> 17:10.529
20, 30 more years left,

17:11.531 --> 17:13.615
and my family history says

17:15.159 --> 17:16.493
l have less.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.038
Now, the old Stanley Hudson
would have found

17:20.123 --> 17:23.417
something to complain about
with this actress,

17:23.501 --> 17:26.753
but that's no way
to live life.

17:27.672 --> 17:31.007
Look at this healthy, sexy,

young woman.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.263
Come on, people.

17:36.347 --> 17:39.975
She is hot.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.394
And it was
a terrible war.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.147
Oh ! So many died.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.982
Far too many died,

17:48.359 --> 17:50.736
but if Frodo hadn't
destroyed the ring,

17:50.820 --> 17:53.739
then goodness itself
might have died.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.534
You're right.
Yeah.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.747
You are right.
l will call Wallace,

the customer list.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.168

all of my info.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.172
You are doing the
right thing, Michael.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.425
Good. So. . .

18:14.844 --> 18:15.886
Where are you going?

18:15.970 --> 18:17.929
Just something
l have to do first.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.431
Where are you taking
the client list?

hurt anyone.

That's the thing
about debating.

entrenched in the view
they had in the first place.

this is what they caII
a bittersweet moment.

lt is bitter because
l slightly destroyed
a wonderful little family.

l did a good job.
