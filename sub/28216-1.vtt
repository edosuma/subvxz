Well, I'd like to start by
dispelling some misconceptions.

57:05.857 --> 57:11.210
First, I would like to address
these rumors...

57:11.253 --> 57:15.040
that have been swirling around, by categorically stating...

57:15.083 --> 57:17.869

57:17.912 --> 57:21.481
completely eschewed the use

58:01.652 --> 58:06.047
Our true eureka moment was the
discovery by researchers...

58:06.091 --> 58:09.834
of trace amounts of a
previously unknown protein.

58:11.792 --> 58:13.794
Ambrosthrombonin.

58:13.838 --> 58:17.929
Ambrosthrombonin is now known
to regulate regeneration...

58:17.972 --> 58:20.801
in the jellyfish and in other
creatures.

58:20.845 --> 58:23.891
The good news, our genes
are already coded...

58:23.935 --> 58:26.198
to produce Ambrosthrombonin.

58:26.241 --> 58:29.070
It occurs naturally in humans.

58:29.114 --> 58:32.204
Inherited from our common
single-celled ancestor...

58:32.247 --> 58:36.121
that first twitched to life
1.2 billion years ago.

58:36.164 --> 58:39.733
The bad news, our bodies only
produce this protein...

58:39.777 --> 58:42.562
in very tiny, trace amounts.

58:44.521 --> 58:47.698
Unfortunately, it is has still
proved impossible for us...

58:47.741 --> 58:51.310
to synthesize Ambrosthrombonin.

58:52.964 --> 58:56.837
So, we had to take a different
approach.

58:56.881 --> 59:00.754
We needed to figure out how to
induce human bone marrow...

59:00.798 --> 59:04.758

times more Ambrosthrombonin.

59:04.802 --> 59:08.588
In early tests, we successfully
combined different...

59:08.632 --> 59:11.896

genes from the jellyfish...

59:11.939 --> 59:13.724
with the human hemoglobin gene.

59:15.682 --> 59:18.729
We developed techniques to
remove the donor DNA...

59:18.772 --> 59:21.122
from the egg and replace it...

59:21.166 --> 59:25.039
with the super Ambrosthrombonin-producing DNA.

59:25.083 --> 59:28.565
To stimulate the eggs, so that
they will grow into embryos...

59:28.608 --> 59:32.612
the perfect combination turned
out to be not just donor
sperm...

59:32.656 --> 59:35.833

of that...

and they provided us with
stem cells coded...

01:00:11.216 --> 01:00:14.306
to make Ambrosthrombonin.

01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:17.831

the recipient to produce...

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:20.834
