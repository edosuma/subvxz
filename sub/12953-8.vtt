00:04.846 --> 00:07.174
We were driving on Mulholland -- you know, all the curves,

00:07.220 --> 00:10.883
and we come around this corner, and the sun's right in our eyes.

00:10.976 --> 00:11.920
Egg whites?

00:11.966 --> 00:13.577
Sure. Thanks.

00:13.654 --> 00:14.978
So the sun's in your face?

00:15.163 --> 00:16.441
Completely blinding me.

00:16.534 --> 00:19.481
And the first thing he does without even thinking about it,

00:19.668 --> 00:21.422
- he slaps down the...
- Visor.

00:21.516 --> 00:24.081
Yeah, the visor. So the sun's not in my eyes.

00:24.781 --> 00:27.824
And I just thought, that was so sweet.

00:27.870 --> 00:29.430
He really likes you.

00:30.690 --> 00:32.090
He's so funny.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.690
You're not gonna break his heart, though, right?

00:34.923 --> 00:35.917
Me?

00:36.101 --> 00:37.665
Eric's a friend. You know what I mean.

00:37.758 --> 00:39.132
No, I like him, too.

00:42.066 --> 00:45.003
- But?
- But nothing.

00:47.990 --> 00:49.840
- Hello?
- Yeah?

00:49.933 --> 00:50.735
Yeah, I'll be there.

00:52.509 --> 00:53.501
We'll eat later.

00:53.593 --> 00:54.870
She compared you to ice cream?

00:54.964 --> 00:56.998
Yeah, vanilla swiss almond, which is a really significant flavor.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.327
I'm not saying it's not.

00:58.421 --> 01:00.605
And then she said that I'm this big spoonful.

01:00.698 --> 01:01.832
Which you took as a compliment?

01:01.925 --> 01:04.187
I take everything she says as a compliment. She's got that great accent.

01:04.325 --> 01:07.129
I don't know. I can't even look at this girl, she's so pretty.

01:07.223 --> 01:09.216
Nadia's great. I know that, all right?

01:09.309 --> 01:10.874
But you might want to just consider taking it slow.

01:10.967 --> 01:13.151
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's with the warning?

01:13.291 --> 01:14.473
Sally Vincent.

01:14.986 --> 01:17.646
Sally -- that was a completely different story.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.114
How is that different? When it ended, you were all, like, weird.

01:20.206 --> 01:21.055
Weird how?

01:21.380 --> 01:22.849
You were building ships in bottles.

01:22.943 --> 01:25.889
You built many, many ships in many bottles over many, many months.

01:26.009 --> 01:27.430
Yeah, that's called a hobby.

01:27.523 --> 01:29.421
A hobby? You locked yourself in a closet for a month.

01:29.514 --> 01:31.316
Tell me you don't still think about how I got those ships in the bottles.

01:31.362 --> 01:32.450
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:32.588 --> 01:33.723
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:33.910 --> 01:34.948
What's going on?

01:35.087 --> 01:37.462
We got called in, but they've been in there all morning.

01:38.489 --> 01:39.414
That's weird.

01:39.506 --> 01:40.212
What do you think it is?

01:40.305 --> 01:41.201
We don't know.

01:41.386 --> 01:42.188
Here we go.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.593 --> 01:57.967
As you know, my position here at A.P.O.

01:58.155 --> 02:02.675
is contingent upon an agreement I made with director Chase's office last year.

02:03.421 --> 02:05.749
That agreement includes a short list

02:06.262 --> 02:09.687
of operatives with whom I am not authorized to engage.

02:09.872 --> 02:13.011
So that if a mission arose that involved any of these people,

02:13.103 --> 02:15.478
I am to immediately recuse myself.

02:15.617 --> 02:18.185
I am to step down.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.901
Well, that day has come.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.315
So as of now, I am giving full operational authority

02:25.408 --> 02:28.355
over your next assignment to Jack Bristow.

02:29.054 --> 02:34.196
I would ask for your cooperation in not involving me at all.

02:35.411 --> 02:36.307
Good luck.

02:42.658 --> 02:44.079
So, what, he's not coming back?

02:44.200 --> 02:45.668
When this matter is resolved, yes.

02:45.854 --> 02:47.228
If Sloane can't touch this case,

02:47.275 --> 02:49.362
then why did they assign it to his task force?

02:49.436 --> 02:50.667
Because of Sydney.

02:50.805 --> 02:54.135
Our target is someone with whom several of you are quite familiar.

02:54.413 --> 02:56.883
- Who is it?
- Anna Espinosa.

02:58.284 --> 02:59.418
I thought--

03:00.445 --> 03:03.470
- She's supposed to be dead.
- So are a lot of people.

03:03.702 --> 03:04.598
Who is she?

03:04.738 --> 03:07.113
Former soviet agent raised in Cuba.

03:07.299 --> 03:08.575
Used to be K-Directorate.

03:08.669 --> 03:10.234
Four days ago, our London listening post

03:10.325 --> 03:13.655
intercepted chatter about a dead drop from a suspected terrorist group.

03:13.888 --> 03:17.312
Satellite surveillance of the specified location revealed this.

03:24.831 --> 03:25.537
Marshall.

03:25.629 --> 03:26.192
Thank you.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.792
And congratulations on the, uh...

03:30.191 --> 03:32.758
Uh, now, I pulled the files on miss Espinosa.

03:32.989 --> 03:35.603
She specializes in close-quarter kills,

03:35.696 --> 03:37.880
strangulation, edged weapons, guns,

03:37.973 --> 03:39.250
high-level theft, security breech --

03:39.343 --> 03:41.558
She spent six years on Interpol's most-wanted list.

03:41.650 --> 03:43.356
Six and a half, actually.

03:43.542 --> 03:44.867
Did the --

03:45.053 --> 03:47.811
After she left K-Directorate, she went freelance.

03:47.949 --> 03:48.751
Worked for the highest bidder.

03:48.844 --> 03:50.979
You know, give her the dough, she'll give you the show.

03:51.166 --> 03:55.593
She's also associated with the followers of Rambaldi.

03:58.347 --> 04:00.770
Intel indicates Anna's making contact with an associate

04:00.863 --> 04:03.715
in Brussels 36 hours from now...

04:03.807 --> 04:04.877
Excuse me.

04:04.969 --> 04:06.933
Concerning an assignment --

04:12.052 --> 04:13.044
Sydney?

04:13.698 --> 04:15.118
You want us to surveille the meet.

04:15.678 --> 04:16.382
Yes.

04:16.616 --> 04:17.798
You, Marshall, and Dixon.

04:18.218 --> 04:20.019
Given your familiarity with Anna's methods,

04:20.095 --> 04:21.182
I want you to track her movements.

04:21.274 --> 04:22.887
Find out what the assignment is.

04:23.026 --> 04:25.066
If  the opportunity presents itself,

04:25.114 --> 04:26.677
you're authorized to bring her in.

04:26.816 --> 04:31.243
The category of force you choose to exercise will remain classified.

04:32.830 --> 04:34.204
When do we leave?

04:34.530 --> 04:35.998
We're arranging a jet for this evening.

04:36.138 --> 04:39.084
You'll have 20 hours in country to coordinate before the meet.

04:40.158 --> 04:40.863
That's all.

04:44.926 --> 04:46.491
- What happened?
- I don't know.

04:49.198 --> 04:50.333
Are you okay?

04:51.032 --> 04:52.311
I got lightheaded.

04:53.102 --> 04:55.077
We  have a while before we have to leave.

04:55.217 --> 04:56.637
Do you want to grab something to eat?

04:56.730 --> 04:57.388
Sure.

04:58.135 --> 05:01.130
It was just me and Anna in the middle of the stadium.

05:01.269 --> 05:02.881
I have the key, she has the box.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.906
We needed to work together to get the code.

05:06.698 --> 05:08.882
But there she is right next to me.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.734
All I kept thinking was, I could take her out right now.

05:13.012 --> 05:14.482
End it once and for all.

05:14.573 --> 05:15.995
That wasn't your assignment.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.041
Not that night.

05:21.253 --> 05:25.583
But I swore to myself if I ever had the chance again, I would not hesitate.

05:26.190 --> 05:28.421
This can't be easy for you.

05:29.027 --> 05:30.734
I'm not worried about me.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.277
What's going on with you?

05:36.405 --> 05:40.975
I know only a few things about Rambaldi.

05:41.114 --> 05:43.727
I know he was a prophet, 15th century.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.860
I know my father was --

05:46.093 --> 05:49.803
is -- I don't know, obsessed with him.

05:50.223 --> 05:53.313
Last year, when my father connected me to Rambaldi,

05:53.499 --> 05:55.874
I started to hallucinate, and...

05:56.854 --> 05:59.659
I saw something awful.

06:01.432 --> 06:02.901
Sounds and fast images --

06:02.994 --> 06:04.988
they went by quickly, but...

06:07.227 --> 06:11.224
there was one vision that felt so real.

06:11.363 --> 06:12.785
What was it?

06:14.512 --> 06:17.412
We were both together,

06:17.831 --> 06:20.015
scared and upset,

06:20.715 --> 06:21.944
holding guns

06:22.457 --> 06:23.718
aimed at each other.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.588
And I remember my hands were shaking.

06:30.717 --> 06:32.900
And I pulled the trigger.

06:35.515 --> 06:38.034
Blood was pouring down your chest, and...

06:38.826 --> 06:40.390
I wanted to say I was sorry,

06:40.530 --> 06:42.610
but you just looked at me

06:42.940 --> 06:45.270
as if you'd been expecting it.

06:46.670 --> 06:49.380
As if you knew all along...

06:51.108 --> 06:54.008
knew I was going to kill you.

06:55.688 --> 06:58.397
I know I must sound insane.

07:01.058 --> 07:04.054
Nadia, there's something I should have told you.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.335
Miss Bristow?

07:07.893 --> 07:09.123
There's a call for you.

07:15.662 --> 07:17.655
- Hi.
- Here you go.

07:18.945 --> 07:19.937
Hello?

07:21.945 --> 07:23.318
Hello, Sydney.

07:25.372 --> 07:26.650
Anna.

07:27.349 --> 07:28.866
Turn around.

07:37.599 --> 07:39.974
I'd advise against any action.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.631
My associates wouldn't like that.

07:52.532 --> 07:55.051
There's something I need you to do for me, Sydney.

07:57.945 --> 08:03.373
I must say, I have been looking forward to working with you again.

08:36.008 --> 08:37.427
Anna has Nadia.

08:37.659 --> 08:40.559
She knew she was going to be intercepted in Brussels, so she took her.

08:40.652 --> 08:42.169
If I don't do what she says,

08:42.494 --> 08:46.157
dad, she's going to kill my sister.

09:03.767 --> 09:04.997
If we don't meet her demands,

09:05.090 --> 09:07.085
Anna Espinosa claims she'll kill Nadia.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.359
We have 18 hours to comply.

09:08.499 --> 09:09.204
What are her demands?

09:09.343 --> 09:11.527
She wants me to take the meet in Brussels posing as her.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.995
I'm to retrieve a package from a man named Milos Sabine.

09:14.089 --> 09:15.128
If I deliver it to her --

09:15.267 --> 09:17.355
a boutique in Beverly Hills -- by a specified time,

09:17.448 --> 09:18.869
she claims she'll let Nadia go.

09:18.964 --> 09:20.862
Sydney, scrap the surveillance op in Brussels.

09:20.953 --> 09:22.374
Get with Marshall to coordinate new parameters.

09:22.561 --> 09:24.458
You're going in as Anna Espinosa.

09:24.691 --> 09:26.140
Dig up everything you can about Sabine --

09:26.234 --> 09:28.322
business associates, last-known whereabouts, the works.

09:28.414 --> 09:29.692
Coordinate with Langley.

09:29.784 --> 09:31.444
We'll need total satellite coverage of the meeting point.

09:31.491 --> 09:34.057
I want sniper teams and full ground support ready to go.

09:34.149 --> 09:34.573
On it.

09:34.665 --> 09:36.277
We'll wheels up within the hour.

09:44.262 --> 09:47.114
Approaching the metro station.

09:49.357 --> 09:50.346
Do you see anyone?

09:50.720 --> 09:52.235
White male, late 70s.

09:52.515 --> 09:53.601
There's no photo in his file,

09:53.647 --> 09:56.357
but based on estimated date of birth, this could be our guy.

10:03.643 --> 10:06.494
This time of year does terrible things to my hair.

10:08.454 --> 10:09.780
Miss Espinosa.

10:13.001 --> 10:15.471
How I wish that I were younger.

10:15.938 --> 10:17.580
Do you have the package?

10:17.811 --> 10:21.283
What your associates have requested of me is...

10:21.703 --> 10:23.076
highly valuable.

10:23.635 --> 10:28.061
I would like to make sure that I get my money's worth.

10:28.388 --> 10:33.958
Are you prepared to reach your end?

10:34.098 --> 10:39.000
I'm always prepared once apprised of the specifics.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.373
30 minutes ago a man entered the Hotel Metropol.

10:42.653 --> 10:45.505
He is currently enjoying a 17-year-old Scotch

10:45.596 --> 10:48.781
in  the bar located in the west lobby of the hotel.

10:48.967 --> 10:52.916
The man's name is Willem Karg.

10:53.943 --> 10:55.602
This is the man.

10:57.329 --> 10:59.417
The man you are to kill.

11:00.212 --> 11:03.396
I will require photographic evidence of his corpse,

11:03.490 --> 11:08.200
plus what I understand is your keepsake --

11:08.293 --> 11:10.669
his right index finger.

11:11.695 --> 11:15.787
I will be sitting on this bench for the next 40 minutes.

11:16.020 --> 11:20.473
Return within that time, and you will get your package.

11:20.800 --> 11:27.038
After that, I will not be sitting on this bench.

11:29.700 --> 11:33.839
Tick-tock, miss Espinosa.

11:33.931 --> 11:35.209
Hotel Metropol -- seven blocks away.

11:35.349 --> 11:36.293
We have 32 minutes.

11:36.432 --> 11:37.613
Marshall, how are we doing on Karg?

11:37.707 --> 11:38.746
Do you have anything on him yet?

11:38.838 --> 11:39.641
On its way.

11:40.387 --> 11:41.902
It's a rather large file.

11:43.116 --> 11:44.041
We got it.

11:44.180 --> 11:45.581
This guy's wanted in four different countries.

11:45.675 --> 11:47.525
Money laundering, kidnapping, conspiracy.

11:47.756 --> 11:50.514
Affiliations -- russian and chinese organized crime syndicates.

11:50.606 --> 11:53.171
Known associates -- Anton Matteo and Peter Giger.

11:53.219 --> 11:55.258
Solicitation for prostitution, three charges.

11:55.351 --> 11:57.010
This guy's got a real thing for hookers.

11:57.102 --> 11:57.479
Wait.

12:14.714 --> 12:18.376
There you are, ma'am. Room 1132. Two keys.

12:20.337 --> 12:22.856
Will you be needing any help with any bags?

12:24.068 --> 12:27.350
No, thank you. I'm traveling light.

12:43.372 --> 12:44.554
Willem?

12:46.140 --> 12:46.942
Ja?

12:50.163 --> 12:55.448
Do you know how hard it has been to find you?

12:56.083 --> 13:00.557
If I knew you were looking, I would have made it a lot easier.

13:00.649 --> 13:05.980
Matteo said you were not drinking anymore, you bad boy.

13:06.073 --> 13:07.972
I won't tell Matteo.

13:08.765 --> 13:10.996
How do you know my business partner?

13:11.322 --> 13:14.984
Who do you think sent me to you?

13:17.131 --> 13:20.126
I am Matteo's early birthday present.

13:20.219 --> 13:21.594
Really?

13:22.993 --> 13:26.607
He wouldn't tell me how old you were.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.783
He knows I don't usually...

13:30.574 --> 13:33.998
work with older men.

13:34.652 --> 13:36.453
You don't seem so old.

13:36.546 --> 13:38.493
Thank you so much.

13:41.201 --> 13:42.765
We have a room.

13:43.465 --> 13:45.075
Shall we?

13:45.588 --> 13:49.441
So it's happy birthday to me, ja?

13:50.329 --> 13:52.417
Great, beautiful arms.

13:53.070 --> 13:56.142
I love... arms.

13:58.336 --> 14:00.804
Hey, what -- what is this?

14:01.085 --> 14:02.028
It's your lucky day.

14:02.121 --> 14:02.922
You get to live.

14:03.062 --> 14:04.291
We're gonna need that ring.

14:04.384 --> 14:05.279
And the finger it's on.

14:05.419 --> 14:06.744
What's happening?!

14:06.930 --> 14:08.667
There are people out there who want you dead.

14:08.712 --> 14:10.277
Fortunately for you, we're not them.

14:10.368 --> 14:13.126
When this is over, you're gonna walk out of this hotel and disappear.

14:13.172 --> 14:14.307
You'll thank us for it later.

14:14.398 --> 14:16.823
What are you doing? Aah!

14:25.136 --> 14:26.747
You look like her.

14:27.775 --> 14:28.956
Your mother.

14:29.234 --> 14:31.895
Don't waste your time trying to scare me.

14:33.809 --> 14:35.467
You are scared.

14:39.203 --> 14:40.814
I would be scared, too,

14:41.281 --> 14:45.230
if I did not understand what this was all about.

14:46.957 --> 14:48.473
She told me about you.

14:49.219 --> 14:50.497
Sydney.

14:51.476 --> 14:52.991
I know enough.

14:53.598 --> 14:56.783
Your sister -- she's a curse.

14:58.089 --> 15:00.227
You see what happens, don't you?

15:00.833 --> 15:02.589
To everyone she loves.

15:03.754 --> 15:06.559
One day you will be asked to pay the price.

15:09.127 --> 15:13.314
Today you will feel a little bit of that.

15:29.986 --> 15:31.407
Please! Please!

15:31.500 --> 15:32.969
There must be another way! Please!

15:33.108 --> 15:34.147
We've got nine minutes left.

15:35.288 --> 15:36.708
Keep him quiet.

15:36.804 --> 15:37.317
Yeah.

15:37.878 --> 15:38.565
Please!

15:38.658 --> 15:40.080
Bite this. Bite this.

15:40.592 --> 15:41.870
- You got him?
- Yeah.

15:42.523 --> 15:43.752
Look at me.

15:43.892 --> 15:44.693
Look at me.

15:45.066 --> 15:48.062
Look at me. Look at me.

15:48.153 --> 15:48.905
Look at me.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.629
What are you people doing?

16:06.722 --> 16:07.379
Don't move.

16:24.803 --> 16:27.559
Your reputation is well-earned.

16:27.790 --> 16:29.880
I still wish I were younger.

16:37.586 --> 16:41.868
You should let your associates know that this

16:41.961 --> 16:44.717
is the last remaining sample.

16:45.417 --> 16:48.602
They should treat it as if it were sacred.

16:49.161 --> 16:50.725
Absolutely.

16:55.067 --> 16:57.062
I've got it. I'm on my way.

16:57.948 --> 17:01.802
This is a gift from me...

17:02.408 --> 17:03.353
to you...

17:05.593 --> 17:07.012
to Sydney.

17:07.321 --> 17:10.935
Every time she looks at you,

17:11.589 --> 17:14.011
I want her to think of me.

17:14.150 --> 17:15.665
And one day,

17:15.759 --> 17:17.464
whether  you choose to or not,

17:18.117 --> 17:21.877
you will help me destroy her.

17:27.481 --> 17:28.854
The lab confirmed

17:29.087 --> 17:30.507
it's the Dante compound --

17:30.646 --> 17:32.784
a super-rare phosphorous-based putty.

17:33.015 --> 17:35.104
But not the same kind of putty

17:35.196 --> 17:38.335
you'd use on the newspaper to copy "beetle bailey" out of --

17:38.473 --> 17:39.799
you ever do that with --

17:39.937 --> 17:41.692
Anyway, it's completely harmless on its own.

17:41.833 --> 17:44.828
But when mixed with certain nerve agents -- VX gas in particular --

17:44.920 --> 17:45.815
boo-yah-ca!

17:45.907 --> 17:47.042
It mutates the neurotoxins,

17:47.182 --> 17:51.323
causing them to self-replicate at a rate that would be, like, historic.

17:51.787 --> 17:54.592
We'll have to secure all chemical laboratories that manufacture VX.

17:55.105 --> 17:57.145
How long would it take you to construct a fake?

17:57.517 --> 17:58.891
A fake?

17:58.983 --> 18:01.787
You mean like something that would actually pass as the real thing?

18:01.880 --> 18:03.777
Sydney's meeting with Anna in 30 minutes.

18:04.055 --> 18:06.478
Turning this over to her is not the ideal option.

18:06.618 --> 18:07.180
Can you do it?

18:07.321 --> 18:08.573
No. Absolutely not, no.

18:09.565 --> 18:11.209
Okay, probably.

18:11.816 --> 18:13.523
But, listen, one more thing.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.608
I know this isn't, you know, like my province,

18:15.701 --> 18:18.553
but I think I have an idea who Anna's working for.

18:18.644 --> 18:22.450
There's this fringe terrorist cell called the Cadmus Revolutionary Front.

18:22.543 --> 18:23.534
Yeah, they're former Covenant.

18:23.629 --> 18:25.429
Right, so I don't need to tell you how -- do you?

18:25.522 --> 18:26.944
Yes, I know who they are.

18:27.176 --> 18:28.692
Well, turns out the CRF --

18:28.831 --> 18:31.921
they've been trying to acquire the Dante compound for over a year.

18:32.060 --> 18:33.719
I think they're trying to build a chemical bomb.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.280
I read the Echelon report on the CRF.

18:35.374 --> 18:36.413
We don't know what their agenda is.

18:36.486 --> 18:37.860
Then we increase our knowledge base.

18:37.953 --> 18:40.375
Figure a way to penetrate the CRF and determine their motives.

18:40.468 --> 18:42.175
Well, we actually have somebody in custody

18:42.641 --> 18:43.918
with CRF connections,

18:43.964 --> 18:45.576
considering their Covenant ties and all.

18:46.136 --> 18:47.032
Oh, god.

18:47.964 --> 18:50.721
If we give Anna a fake, she will kill Nadia. You know that.

18:50.842 --> 18:52.691
Turning over the compound would be irresponsible,

18:52.783 --> 18:53.967
not to mention unnecessary.

18:54.059 --> 18:56.338
My responsibility is to get Nadia back --

18:56.570 --> 18:57.944
safe, alive.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.458
He's right, Sydney.

18:59.689 --> 19:00.967
What are you talking about?

19:01.292 --> 19:02.523
I'm trying to save your daughter.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.847
Giving Anna the compound is an unnecessary risk.

19:06.407 --> 19:07.922
Unnecessary?

19:08.109 --> 19:09.529
She won't kill her.

19:09.714 --> 19:11.231
It's not her destiny.

19:12.164 --> 19:14.492
Please tell me this is not about what I think it is.

19:14.584 --> 19:15.718
If you had faith,

19:15.997 --> 19:17.657
you would know what I know.

19:17.749 --> 19:19.551
Faith in a 15th century lunatic?

19:19.644 --> 19:23.450
Dad, please tell me Rambaldi is not dictating procedures.

19:25.505 --> 19:27.451
He has no authority here,

19:27.590 --> 19:28.963
and I know Anna better than anyone.

19:29.056 --> 19:30.762
That's why you chose me for this mission.

19:30.902 --> 19:33.992
Dad, please, I need to get my sister back.

19:37.867 --> 19:38.621
Thank you.

19:45.577 --> 19:47.142
You shouldn't be here, Arvin.

19:52.606 --> 19:54.790
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:54.975 --> 19:55.777
Where are you going?

19:55.870 --> 19:57.386
I'll tell you later. When's the meet with Anna?

19:57.992 --> 19:58.696
Now.

20:00.330 --> 20:01.655
Nadia's gonna be okay.

20:03.709 --> 20:05.465
I just want the ghosts to go away.

20:05.510 --> 20:06.693
Tell me about it.

20:36.212 --> 20:37.011
Here.

20:38.087 --> 20:39.362
Nice work.

20:41.136 --> 20:42.985
You aren't even gonna look at it?

20:43.217 --> 20:44.448
I trust you.

20:44.774 --> 20:46.480
You wouldn't try to deceive me, would you?

20:55.494 --> 20:56.962
Where's my sister?

20:59.856 --> 21:02.087
Wait five minutes after my exit,

21:02.553 --> 21:06.980
then go to the fourth floor of the parking structure across the street...

21:07.773 --> 21:10.433
or my friends will blow a hole in your heart.

21:10.525 --> 21:12.137
Get your hands off me.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.890
It was nice getting to know your sister.

21:55.164 --> 21:56.898
Dispatch, I need backup.

22:01.054 --> 22:03.048
She can have the blouse.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.479
Are you okay?

23:06.397 --> 23:07.293
Open it up.

23:07.805 --> 23:10.084
- Procedure dictates --
- We're old friends.

23:11.810 --> 23:15.044
Actually, given our shared intimacies with your late wife,

23:15.369 --> 23:18.889
I may even go so far as to say that we're family.

23:31.826 --> 23:34.104
Mr. Vaughn, your timing is impeccable.

23:34.571 --> 23:36.687
The last of my broken bones is finally healed,

23:36.781 --> 23:40.490
and I sit before you a fresh candidate for your aggression.

23:40.629 --> 23:44.769
Before we begin whatever inquisition you're here for, there is a

23:44.955 --> 23:47.472
pesky question that's been lingering in my head.

23:47.705 --> 23:48.839
Do you mind?

23:49.539 --> 23:50.245
Go ahead.

23:51.505 --> 23:54.213
Was it the infidelity or the espionage

23:54.307 --> 23:57.014
that motivated you to kill the woman I loved?

23:57.510 --> 23:58.739
The woman you loved?

23:59.065 --> 24:01.343
Yes. Loved.

24:02.464 --> 24:06.079
You know, she once actually told me that she longed to love you,

24:08.553 --> 24:13.960
but the mundane existence you provided couldn't hold a candle to my passion.

24:16.061 --> 24:18.580
That wasn't for sleeping with the woman I was married to.

24:18.673 --> 24:20.046
I couldn't care less about her.

24:20.165 --> 24:22.349
Then what? The torture?

24:22.488 --> 24:23.864
This is how it's gonna be,

24:24.187 --> 24:26.276
and I'm only going to give you one shot at this.

24:26.742 --> 24:30.691
The CRF -- they've hired Anna Espinosa. They're building a bomb.

24:30.829 --> 24:33.661
Why have they made repeated attempts to contact you?

24:34.315 --> 24:37.214
- So it's begun.
- What has?

24:37.540 --> 24:39.343
Wouldn't you like to know.

24:39.434 --> 24:40.378
Well, you're gonna tell me

24:40.518 --> 24:42.368
what they're planning and where they're located.

24:42.460 --> 24:44.597
And if you're fishing for some type of pardon agreement,

24:44.783 --> 24:45.869
it's not in the cards.

24:46.056 --> 24:48.335
But I am willing to provide you certain amenities

24:48.427 --> 24:51.327
that will make your life in confinement a little more comfortable.

24:51.887 --> 24:55.072
I see your bargaining skills have gone the way of your manhood.

24:55.444 --> 24:56.770
Let me rephrase that.

24:56.909 --> 24:59.045
I'd be willing to leave you with what you already have

24:59.091 --> 25:01.370
and not make your life more uncomfortable.

25:03.284 --> 25:05.230
I don't see that there's much left to take away.

25:05.322 --> 25:06.647
You stonewall me,

25:07.347 --> 25:09.246
and I'll have you shipped to Alder penitentiary,

25:09.337 --> 25:13.333
and I'll have you secured in darkened solitary till the end of days.

25:13.566 --> 25:16.798
24/7 in a pitch black cell with zero human contact

25:16.891 --> 25:18.360
is a slow way to die,

25:19.713 --> 25:21.850
especially with all the demons you've got in your closet.

25:21.943 --> 25:23.266
And believe me,

25:23.314 --> 25:25.260
they will come knocking.

25:26.658 --> 25:28.987
I regret to inform you, mr. Vaughn...

25:31.086 --> 25:32.555
I'm not afraid of the dark.

25:41.334 --> 25:42.374
You should be.

25:42.793 --> 25:44.880
I'm having you transferred to Alder tonight.

26:08.092 --> 26:09.322
How did he respond?

26:09.463 --> 26:10.644
As expected.

26:11.157 --> 26:13.054
We'll send in the surgical team this evening.

26:28.372 --> 26:29.507
What did she do to you?

26:29.693 --> 26:30.588
I'll be okay.

26:30.868 --> 26:32.288
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

26:33.035 --> 26:33.788
I should go.

26:46.443 --> 26:47.004
Hey.

26:48.125 --> 26:49.784
I'm so glad you're all right.

26:52.072 --> 26:53.253
Thank you, Sydney.

26:54.328 --> 26:55.510
The doctor's waiting.

26:57.050 --> 26:59.569
The tissue in the scorched region's completely macerated,

26:59.662 --> 27:01.177
so we'll have to graft new skin.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.098
But we can fix this.

27:03.658 --> 27:04.269
Thank you.

27:04.454 --> 27:06.351
I'll be back in a minute and dress it for you.

27:07.612 --> 27:09.079
We're gonna find Anna.

27:09.499 --> 27:11.969
We know who she's working for now. We're tracking her down.

27:12.061 --> 27:15.246
She said things about us.

27:15.992 --> 27:17.558
That we'll be torn apart.

27:18.473 --> 27:19.702
What does that mean?

27:22.690 --> 27:23.871
When mom died,

27:24.105 --> 27:26.717
I requested clearance to her files.

27:26.950 --> 27:27.893
I got it.

27:28.546 --> 27:29.729
There was an audio tape --

27:29.821 --> 27:32.481
surveillance from a hotel room in Hamburg.

27:32.836 --> 27:34.543
She was talking to a man.

27:34.635 --> 27:36.390
His voice was never identified.

27:37.089 --> 27:40.228
She was describing the symbology of this --

27:41.254 --> 27:43.038
the mark of Rambaldi.

27:43.177 --> 27:46.123
She said the outer markings represented her two daughters.

27:46.543 --> 27:52.446
The center is the object over which they will do great battle...

27:54.127 --> 27:56.073
with each other.

27:56.584 --> 27:58.150
Those were her words.

28:01.744 --> 28:03.784
And then mom went quiet.

28:03.924 --> 28:07.348
It was almost like the next part was too painful.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.192
Tell me.

28:08.332 --> 28:09.563
Nadia, it's insane.

28:09.700 --> 28:10.359
What?

28:11.459 --> 28:14.836
According to Rambaldi, only one of the daughters will survive.

28:16.049 --> 28:17.709
I am not going to lie to you.

28:18.315 --> 28:21.595
Some of the predictions Rambaldi made have come true.

28:24.490 --> 28:27.579
So if -- if you want to go back...

28:27.700 --> 28:29.215
To Argentina?

28:30.802 --> 28:34.322
Do you believe in all this? Rambaldi?

28:35.955 --> 28:36.423
No.

28:39.225 --> 28:41.503
But the people who do are dangerous.

28:41.830 --> 28:42.823
They're zealots

28:42.867 --> 28:45.527
who will stop at nothing to make their visions into reality.

28:45.622 --> 28:46.994
Are you kidding me?

28:47.647 --> 28:52.453
Change my life because some freakshow made a prediction 400 years ago?

28:54.041 --> 28:56.558
Anna contrived to tear us apart

28:57.212 --> 29:00.444
to make some ridiculous prophecy come true.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.842
But we're together now.

29:54.424 --> 29:56.225
Sark's being transported to Alder tonight.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.680
Good, because his tracking device is in.

29:58.819 --> 29:59.954
That anaesthetic gas --

30:00.093 --> 30:02.039
totally knocked Sark out. Didn't know what hit him.

30:02.179 --> 30:04.171
How many hours until the delayed activator goes hot?

30:04.264 --> 30:04.970
24.

30:05.063 --> 30:08.182
Oh, and if the CRF tries to run a countersurveillance sweep on Sark,

30:08.600 --> 30:09.689
no detecto.

30:09.919 --> 30:12.581
That's not the only modification that mr. Bristow authorized.

30:13.980 --> 30:17.071
The tracker is packed with a high-density explosive.

30:17.772 --> 30:20.812
Just enough to blow off his melon in case he tries to go off-book.

30:22.493 --> 30:23.913
You mess with a friend of Flinkman,

30:24.005 --> 30:25.235
you're messing with Flinkman.

30:25.422 --> 30:26.652
Good job, Marshall.

30:51.918 --> 30:53.624
This is transport team Alpha.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.851
We have secured the prisoner, and we are en route.

30:55.989 --> 30:57.553
E.T.A., 0600.

30:58.393 --> 30:59.337
Copy that!

31:16.197 --> 31:18.571
Put your head down! Shoot!

31:32.909 --> 31:34.188
Come with me!

31:36.941 --> 31:37.837
Come on!

31:39.331 --> 31:40.704
Quickly! Go!

31:46.495 --> 31:47.438
Get in back!

31:47.997 --> 31:49.703
There is change of clothes!

31:51.944 --> 31:53.557
Alpha, do you copy?

32:06.588 --> 32:07.864
You got a minute?

32:08.143 --> 32:10.755
We picked up chatter on a meet scheduled between the CRF

32:10.895 --> 32:13.937
and an administrator at the Shilanost chemical labs in Estonia --

32:14.029 --> 32:14.687
Jan Vorich.

32:14.966 --> 32:18.248
Shilanost was a soviet-run facility. Marginal security at best.

32:18.619 --> 32:21.376
Theft of a level-4 toxin could go unnoticed there for years.

32:21.468 --> 32:23.557
It's probably just a meet, but

32:24.536 --> 32:25.623
if Anna's there,

32:26.229 --> 32:28.937
this would be our best shot at getting her back in our sights.

32:37.109 --> 32:40.152
Take Nadia with you. Observation only.

32:40.478 --> 32:42.709
If Vorich has a sample of VX,

32:42.800 --> 32:44.078
I want you to find out where it is.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.829
This is a surveillance,

32:46.372 --> 32:48.173
not a boxing match.

32:48.686 --> 32:52.109
Can I trust you to maintain your professionalism?

32:53.089 --> 32:55.559
She brings out the worst in me, dad, but,

32:56.024 --> 32:57.494
yes, of course.

33:00.342 --> 33:01.284
What is it?

33:03.554 --> 33:05.355
Anna never checked the sample.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.745
Marshall said he couldn't have made a good fake anyway.

33:08.837 --> 33:10.115
You were right, dad.

33:10.254 --> 33:11.819
I was stubborn. I'm sorry.

33:11.911 --> 33:16.622
You trusted your instincts to ensure the safe return of a fellow agent,

33:17.042 --> 33:18.701
a member of your family,

33:19.026 --> 33:20.447
and you succeeded.

33:31.609 --> 33:35.366
Take the motorcycle. Get yourself to CRF headquarters.

33:35.598 --> 33:36.732
What about you?

33:36.873 --> 33:40.345
Follow protocol! Go!

33:53.561 --> 33:55.316
Tango is in motion.

33:55.455 --> 33:56.876
Copy that. Good work.

33:57.107 --> 33:58.052
In the next 24 hours,

33:58.423 --> 34:01.036
Sark should lead us to CRF headquarters.

34:01.410 --> 34:03.450
We'll put a tactical team on standby.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.766
For now, we wait.

34:08.518 --> 34:10.225
Who wants to order chinese?

34:10.550 --> 34:11.589
I'm starving.

34:12.663 --> 34:13.369
Thai?

34:13.739 --> 34:14.397
Indian?

34:17.853 --> 34:18.559
Sydney?

34:18.976 --> 34:19.779
You and your sister --

34:20.851 --> 34:21.793
are you going after Anna?

34:21.888 --> 34:23.786
This is highly inappropriate. Excuse me.

34:23.877 --> 34:26.014
Come on, Sydney, you know of Anna's beliefs.

34:27.695 --> 34:29.972
You know the lengths she'll go to see them realized.

34:30.297 --> 34:32.815
You want to talk about beliefs?

34:33.004 --> 34:34.757
This is something you want to discuss?

34:36.391 --> 34:37.906
From where I'm standing,

34:38.045 --> 34:40.132
it was your madman obsession with Rambaldi

34:40.226 --> 34:43.601
that dragged me and Nadia into this endless pit of confusion.

34:43.741 --> 34:45.639
So given that, let me ask you --

34:46.339 --> 34:49.000
what is it you believe?

34:49.138 --> 34:51.989
I believe that if the two of you go out on this mission,

34:52.876 --> 34:55.679
and Anna Espinosa has her way,

34:57.313 --> 35:01.929
that only one of you will return home alive.

35:13.605 --> 35:16.073
It's been 24 hours. Sark's tracker is still dark.

35:16.119 --> 35:18.589
I know. I'm checking the satellite, making sure it's not offline.

35:18.682 --> 35:20.008
You're sure you did the insertion properly?

35:20.082 --> 35:20.739
Come on. It's me.

35:20.832 --> 35:23.589
I can't stress enough how critical it is that we locate CRF headquarters.

35:23.681 --> 35:25.865
I know. All right? Why's everybody picking on me?

35:26.283 --> 35:28.563
Seriously. It's hard work.

35:30.430 --> 35:32.136
Okay, I got it. It's hot.

35:32.229 --> 35:36.656
They are in South Africa. Johannesburg.

35:36.794 --> 35:38.550
658 Kroner street, to be exact.

35:38.688 --> 35:39.776
Let's move, people.

35:48.555 --> 35:51.501
Sydney and Nadia are in Estonia pursuing Anna.

35:51.594 --> 35:55.303
Dixon is leading a team to Johannesburg to raid CRF headquarters.

35:56.236 --> 35:58.230
This should all be over soon.

35:58.508 --> 35:59.643
Thank you.

36:17.389 --> 36:19.191
Maintain your perimeter cover points.

36:19.470 --> 36:21.224
We need to lock this building down tight.

36:21.316 --> 36:21.928
No one slips out.

36:22.020 --> 36:24.251
We'd rather take home data on CRF, not prisoners.

36:24.344 --> 36:25.812
Let's go. Go, go, go.

36:42.766 --> 36:43.852
I got something.

37:04.309 --> 37:05.301
Gentlemen.

37:09.223 --> 37:10.834
Were you expecting a bigger party?

37:12.093 --> 37:13.896
This isn't CRF headquarters.

37:15.016 --> 37:16.102
You're a genius.

37:16.848 --> 37:17.791
Where are we?

37:18.911 --> 37:22.622
Nowhere in particular. And that's the truth.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.801
Just a nice place for a chat.

37:27.649 --> 37:30.977
Really, Michael, don't look so shocked.

37:31.443 --> 37:33.721
You couldn't have had such low expectations of me.

37:34.327 --> 37:38.467
Now, with regards to your previous request,

37:39.195 --> 37:42.333
I will help you locate CRF leadership.

37:42.425 --> 37:46.088
But as always, you must do something for me in return.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.454
Why the charade?

37:47.547 --> 37:49.444
If you were going to cooperate, why run at all?

37:50.143 --> 37:52.423
For the bubbly, of course.

38:13.576 --> 38:14.568
We're early.

38:15.267 --> 38:17.928
Who says girls can't make it anywhere on time?

38:19.376 --> 38:20.461
Get comfortable.

38:32.930 --> 38:33.634
Vorich.

38:34.287 --> 38:36.661
All right, one down, one to go.

38:37.687 --> 38:39.967
Where are you, Anna? Come on.

38:54.349 --> 38:55.151
Let's take her.

38:55.243 --> 38:56.045
Bad idea.

38:57.959 --> 38:59.952
I was hoping we could spend a little more time --

39:04.341 --> 39:05.856
Vorich had the VX gas with him.

39:05.996 --> 39:06.511
Go!

40:01.345 --> 40:04.436
Why is the CRF assembling this bomb? What do they have planned?

40:04.715 --> 40:06.088
It's no use.

40:07.256 --> 40:08.867
You're too late.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.590
Tell me!

41:00.562 --> 41:03.081
- Oh, my god, I thought you were...
- Anna.

41:16.996 --> 41:18.084
Nadia.

41:19.344 --> 41:22.719
Oh, god. Oh, god. Don't be scared.

41:23.091 --> 41:25.562
I'm right -- I'm right here.

41:25.793 --> 41:27.357
It's okay. Stay with me.

41:27.636 --> 41:29.821
Just breathe. Just stay with me.

41:31.781 --> 41:32.963
Just keep breathing.

41:33.616 --> 41:35.323
Nadia? Nadia?

41:35.462 --> 41:37.598
Look at me. Look at me. Look me in the eye.

41:37.690 --> 41:38.540
Don't.

41:39.004 --> 41:39.997
Don't.

41:40.182 --> 41:41.823
I'm right here. Don't.
