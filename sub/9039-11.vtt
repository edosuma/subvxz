WEBVTT

00:03.533 --> 00:07.133
- CHECK OUT HOW YOUR BROTHER
SIGNS HIS CARD TO MY PARENTS,

00:07.133 --> 00:10.267
AND KEEP IN MIND,
HE'S KNOWN THEM FOR 12 YEARS.

00:10.267 --> 00:13.033
- "SEASON'S GREETINGS,
RAYMOND BARONE."

00:14.967 --> 00:17.167
- YEAH, MR. WARMTH, HUH?
- YEAH.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.367
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
MAY HELP YOU?

00:18.367 --> 00:21.833
PUT A LITTLE HAPPY FACE
IN THE "O".

00:21.833 --> 00:23.033
PEOPLE LOVE THAT.

00:23.033 --> 00:25.200
- [chuckles]
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS

00:25.200 --> 00:26.967
HAVING CHRISTMAS WITH THEM.

00:26.967 --> 00:28.933
- OH, YEAH.
THE ALTERNATING YEARS, HUH?

00:28.933 --> 00:31.333
YEAH, THAT'S A TREATY THAT YOU
AND RAY WORKED OUT, RIGHT?

00:31.333 --> 00:35.000
- WELL, I WAS DRUNK
ON EGGNOG.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.500
- SO WHAT ARE YOU AND RAY
GONNA GET MOM AND DAD

00:36.500 --> 00:37.500
FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR?

00:37.500 --> 00:40.800
- I DON'T KNOW.
EVERY YEAR IT'S SO HORRIBLE.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.600
POOR RAY,
ALWAYS WRONG.

00:44.733 --> 00:46.967
HE'S OVER THERE RIGHT NOW,
FISHING FOR HINTS.

00:46.967 --> 00:50.000
- YEAH, HINTS.
HA, HE'LL NEVER LEARN.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.267
MOM DOESN'T GIVE IT UP
SO EASY.

00:52.267 --> 00:55.267
SHE ALWAYS GIVES THE SAME
PREPARED STATEMENT EVERY YEAR.

00:55.267 --> 00:57.900
"OH, I DON'T
NEED ANYTHING, DEARS.

00:57.900 --> 01:01.000
I JUST WANT TWO NICE BOYS."

01:03.067 --> 01:04.533
- YOU TWO EVER TRY THAT?

01:04.533 --> 01:07.700
- NICE?
AH, IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.233
WE USED TO JUST GO IN ON SOME
JEAN NATE AFTER BATH SPLASH.

01:12.567 --> 01:15.800
- ALL RIGHT, I THINK
I PICKED UP ON SOMETHING.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.400
OH.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:18.400 --> 01:19.400
- NOTHING.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.033
OVER THERE
SNIFFING OUT HINTS, RAY?

01:22.033 --> 01:23.233
- WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING THEM?

01:23.233 --> 01:25.933
- YOU GO FIRST.
- NO, NO, YOU GO FIRST.

01:25.933 --> 01:27.800
- I SAID
"YOU GO FIRST" FIRST.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.333
- SO?
YOU GO FIRST.

01:29.333 --> 01:32.067
- WHY DON'T YOU BOTH GO
AT THE SAME TIME?

01:32.067 --> 01:34.167
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.600
- ONE, TWO, THREE.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.800
- HAMMOCK.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.400
YOU--YOU...

01:42.700 --> 01:45.500
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.500
- HAMMOCK?

01:46.500 --> 01:48.933
- THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S A PERFECT GIFT.

01:48.933 --> 01:49.933
- YEAH?

01:49.933 --> 01:50.933
YOU REALLY SEE MOM

01:50.933 --> 01:53.367
FIGHTING HER WAY
OUT OF A HAMMOCK?

01:53.367 --> 01:55.933
- SHUT UP.
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

01:55.933 --> 01:57.267
IT'S LIKE
AN OUTDOOR COUCH.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.567
WHEN DAD LIES AROUND,
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK AT HIM.

01:59.567 --> 02:02.300
- WE SHOULD GET A HAMMOCK.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.567
- HAMMOCK?
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

02:03.567 --> 02:04.900
SO LET'S HEAR YOUR IDEA.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.367
- ALL RIGHT.
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

02:06.367 --> 02:10.567
'CAUSE IT BLOWS YOUR HAMMOCK
TO OYSTER BAY.

02:10.567 --> 02:13.900
FAMILY PORTRAIT PHOTO.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.100
- WHO WANTS THAT?

02:16.100 --> 02:17.367
- I THINK MA DOES, OKAY?

02:17.367 --> 02:19.100
I THINK I WAS READING
THE SIGNALS LOUD AND CLEAR.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.100
- YEAH, AND WHAT WERE
THE SIGNALS, RAY?

02:21.100 --> 02:24.267
- SHE SAID,
"RAYMOND, I WOULD REALLY LOVE

02:24.267 --> 02:27.967
"A FAMILY PORTRAIT PHOTO.

02:27.967 --> 02:31.067
INSTEAD OF SOMETHING USELESS,
LIKE A HAMMOCK."

02:31.067 --> 02:32.467
- SHE DID NOT SAY THAT.

02:32.467 --> 02:34.600
- SHE WILL.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.400
- HMM...

02:36.400 --> 02:38.167
YOU KNOW, RAY,
ABOUT THIS PHOTO IDEA?

02:38.167 --> 02:39.767
- YEAH.
- IT'S REALLY STUPID.

02:39.767 --> 02:40.967
- WHY?

02:40.967 --> 02:42.567
IT'S PERFECT.
IT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.

02:42.567 --> 02:43.967
- DON'T YOU THINK?

02:43.967 --> 02:45.167
LOOK, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SPEND, LIKE,

02:45.167 --> 02:46.833
THIS WHOLE AWFUL
AFTERNOON WITH THEM,

02:46.833 --> 02:49.067
AND THEN AFTER WE'RE DONE,
WE HAVE THIS PERMANENT REMINDER

02:49.067 --> 02:51.967
OF THE WHOLE AWFUL
AFTERNOON WITH THEM.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.467
- YOU LOSE.

02:53.467 --> 02:54.333
- YEAH, YOU WISH.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.500
HOW ABOUT BACKING ME UP
HERE A LITTLE?

02:56.500 --> 02:59.367
- WE'RE ALREADY SPENDING
ALL OF CHRISTMAS WITH THEM.

02:59.367 --> 03:01.867
- COME ON, IT'S A FAMILY PHOTO.
IT'LL BE NICE.

03:01.867 --> 03:04.200
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.667
- THANK YOU, HONEY.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.100
NYAH.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.767
IT'S GOOD WE'RE
GETTING IT DONE, YOU KNOW?

03:09.767 --> 03:10.967
'CAUSE...

03:10.967 --> 03:14.567
EVERY YEAR, YOU GET
OLDER-LOOKING, RIGHT?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.300
WHEN I SAY "YOU..."

03:22.400 --> 03:25.300
I...I MEAN ME.

03:27.533 --> 03:30.600
I MEAN ME PLUS $20.

03:38.467 --> 03:39.867
- HERE ARE YOUR
CHRISTMAS COOKIES.

03:39.867 --> 03:43.300
I HAVE TO TELL YOU--
NOT YET.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.733
- WILL SOMEONE ACKNOWLEDGE
THE RECEIPT OF THESE COOKIES

03:45.733 --> 03:47.567
SO I CAN HAVE ONE?

03:47.567 --> 03:48.800
- OH, MARIE, THOSE LOOK--

03:48.800 --> 03:51.200
- GOOD ENOUGH.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.900
- HEY, MOM AND DAD,
I THINK I KNOW

03:52.900 --> 03:54.500
WHAT I'M GONNA GET YOU
FOR CHRISTMAS.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.833
- BETTER NOT BE A PET.

03:55.833 --> 03:57.133
I HATE PEOPLE
WHO GIVE PETS.

03:57.133 --> 03:58.667
- YEAH, YEAH,
WE KNOW, DAD.

03:58.667 --> 03:59.667
- GIVING A PET MEANS,

03:59.667 --> 04:02.767
"YOU'RE OLD, I FIND YOU BORING,
TALK TO A BIRD."

04:05.167 --> 04:07.467
- WE'RE THINKING OF
GETTING YOU A FAMILY PHOTO.

04:07.467 --> 04:10.533
- OH, RAYMOND,
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

04:10.533 --> 04:13.033
- YOU TOLD HIM.

04:13.033 --> 04:16.233
AND YOU KNOW, MOM,
MY GIFT, UNLIKE RAYMOND'S,

04:16.233 --> 04:18.500
IS A TOTAL SURPRISE.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.067
AND...IS BETTER.

04:21.067 --> 04:23.700
- YEAH, ANYWAY, MOM, MOM,

04:23.700 --> 04:26.633
WE'RE GONNA SET IT UP,
YOU KNOW, NEXT WEEK.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.500
THIS WAY YOU'LL HAVE IT
FOR CHRISTMASTIME.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.700
I'M GONNA HAVE DEBRA
SET IT UP.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.900
- OH, RAYMOND,
YOU'RE GOING TO SO MUCH TROUBLE.

04:32.900 --> 04:36.000
- OH, YES, HE IS.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.167
UM, YOU KNOW, MARIE,

04:38.167 --> 04:39.667
WHILE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT CHRISTMAS,

04:39.667 --> 04:41.167
I HAD THIS IDEA.

04:41.167 --> 04:42.733
NOW, I KNOW THIS YEAR
IS YOUR TURN,

04:42.733 --> 04:45.533
BUT I WAS THINKING
OF STARTING A NEW TRADITION.

04:45.533 --> 04:48.200
WHAT IF WE SPEND
CHRISTMAS EVE AT MY PARENTS'

04:48.200 --> 04:50.533
AND CHRISTMAS DAY
AT YOUR HOUSE?

04:50.533 --> 04:53.900
THAT WAY, NOBODY MISSES
CHRISTMAS TOGETHER.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.000
- [chuckles]

04:57.833 --> 04:59.800
THAT'S LOVELY.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.000
BUT YOU'D HAVE TO LEAVE
CONNECTICUT IN THE MIDDLE

05:02.000 --> 05:03.600
OF THE NIGHT TO GET BACK
FOR CHRISTMAS MORNING.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.333
- OH, NO, WELL, WE WOULD
JUST STAY OVERNIGHT THERE,

05:05.333 --> 05:06.800
AND WE'D GET TO YOUR HOUSE
ABOUT 10:00.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.233
- [gasps]

05:10.100 --> 05:12.633
BUT...BUT...

05:13.833 --> 05:16.433
HOW ABOUT THE CHILDREN
COMING DOWNSTAIRS IN THE MORNING

05:16.433 --> 05:19.267
AND OPENING THEIR PRESENTS,
AND THEIR LITTLE FACES...

05:19.267 --> 05:22.567
HOW COULD YOU
TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME?

05:22.567 --> 05:23.567
- WELL...

05:23.567 --> 05:26.600
THEY'LL STILL HAVE FACES
AT 10:00.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.533
- [laughing]
"STILL HAVE FACES AT 10:00."

05:29.533 --> 05:32.600
[laughing]

05:34.367 --> 05:37.267
[mouthing words]

05:41.133 --> 05:43.767
- COME ON,
10:00'S FINE, MARIE.

05:43.767 --> 05:46.533
WHO NEEDS THAT
CRACK-OF-DAWN CRAP?

05:46.533 --> 05:50.867
GRANDPA'LL GIVE YOU
A BETTER SHOW AT 10:00.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.800
- I HAVE TO SAY, DEBRA,

05:52.800 --> 05:56.033
YOU'RE KILLING CHRISTMAS.

05:56.033 --> 05:57.233
- MARIE, I--
YOU KNOW,

05:57.233 --> 06:00.400
IT'S REALLY NOT
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.300
RIGHT, RAY?

06:08.633 --> 06:12.033
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA, RAY?

06:12.033 --> 06:15.700
JUST LIKE I THOUGHT
THE FAMILY PHOTO

06:15.700 --> 06:18.833
WAS A GOOD IDEA.

06:18.833 --> 06:22.067
I LOVED THAT IDEA,
DIDN'T I, RAY?

06:23.767 --> 06:26.733
- YOU KNOW, IT JUST SOUNDS
LIKE A LOT OF DRIVING.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.600
DAD, COULD I BORROW $20?

06:37.633 --> 06:39.700
- I THINK YOU MADE
A WONDERFUL GIFT CHOICE.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.367
YOU HAVE A LOVELY FAMILY.

06:41.367 --> 06:44.467
- YOU HAVEN'T
MET EVERYBODY YET.

06:45.833 --> 06:47.200
- DON'T WORRY.
I CAN HANDLE ANYTHING.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.633
I USED TO BE
A CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER.

06:50.633 --> 06:54.267
- WELL, THEY WON'T BE
AS QUIET AS YOUR OTHER CLIENTS.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.400
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE HERE.
- HI.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.600
- WHERE WERE YOU?
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:59.600 --> 07:00.400
YOU WERE RIGHT BEHIND US.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.367
- YOUR FATHER PARKED
A MILE AWAY.

07:02.367 --> 07:04.133
- THERE'S METERS
RIGHT OUT FRONT.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.333
- THAT'S RIGHT.

07:05.333 --> 07:07.700
METERS, MONEY,
YOUR FATHER.

07:09.033 --> 07:12.900
- MOUTH, NOISE,
YOUR MOTHER.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.667
- FRANK, THERE'S
A MIRROR OVER THERE.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.033
WHY DON'T YOU GO
COMB YOUR--

07:16.033 --> 07:18.467
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.800
- PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY--

07:23.800 --> 07:25.767
ONE OF THE ALL-TIME
GREAT RACKETS.

07:25.767 --> 07:27.167
- ALL RIGHT, DAD,
PLEASE.

07:27.167 --> 07:29.300
- GRAB A CAMERA,
FIND SOME CHUMPS,

07:29.300 --> 07:33.233
MAKE 'EM SMILE AND SAY,
"RIP-OFF."

07:36.833 --> 07:38.300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:38.300 --> 07:40.400
YOU'RE TAKING THE PICTURE
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.867
- RAY, I HAD TO COME
STRAIGHT FROM WORK, OKAY?

07:42.867 --> 07:44.600
- YOU DID THIS
ON PURPOSE.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.567
- WHAT?
- WEARING THAT.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.567
YOU'RE TRYING TO SCREW UP
MY GIFT, RIGHT?

07:49.567 --> 07:51.467
HAMMOCK?

07:52.867 --> 07:55.233
- CALM DOWN.
I BROUGHT CLOTHES.

07:55.233 --> 07:57.200
- YEAH, WELL,
PUT 'EM ON, AND...

07:57.200 --> 07:59.533
JUST WATCH YOURSELF.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.200
- HI, ROBBIE.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.767
YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE,
AREN'T YOU, HONEY?

08:04.767 --> 08:06.433
- Y-YES, MA.

08:06.433 --> 08:07.967
LISTEN, MA,
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

08:07.967 --> 08:09.667
WHY AMY COULDN'T BE
IN THE PICTURE.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.133
- WELL, BECAUSE IT'S
A BARONE FAMILY PICTURE.

08:12.133 --> 08:13.533
IS SHE A BARONE?

08:13.533 --> 08:14.933
- NOT YET, MA.

08:14.933 --> 08:16.100
- WELL, WHEN YOU
MAKE HER A BARONE,

08:16.100 --> 08:17.100
SHE'LL BE
IN THE PICTURE.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.700
- STOP PRESSURING ME!

08:33.267 --> 08:35.533
- YOU'RE NOT CHANGING?
MOM, TELL HIM TO CHANGE.

08:35.533 --> 08:39.733
- [through clenched teeth]
OKAY, OKAY, I'M GOING...

08:39.733 --> 08:41.667
MR. PORTRAITURE.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.133
- YEAH.
THAT'S FUNNY.

08:43.133 --> 08:46.667
- COME ON, NOW,
NOW, NOW, BOYS, BOYS,

08:46.667 --> 08:48.133
PART OF MY PRESENT--

08:48.133 --> 08:50.333
AS LOVELY
AS THIS IS, RAYMOND--

08:50.333 --> 08:51.933
PART OF MY PRESENT
IS THAT WE HAVE

08:51.933 --> 08:53.767
A FAMILY PICTURE
THAT'S HAPPY.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.967
AND PART OF A FAMILY PICTURE
THAT'S HAPPY IS WHAT?

08:55.967 --> 08:57.400
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.
- IT'S HIM--HE'S--

08:57.400 --> 09:01.300
- COME ON, PART OF A FAMILY
PICTURE THAT'S HAPPY IS WHAT?

09:01.300 --> 09:04.300
- TWO NICE BOYS.
- TWO NICE BOYS.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.067
- THAT'S NICE, DEARS.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.067
SEE, NOW, THAT'S
A MERRY CHRISTMAS.

09:08.067 --> 09:11.167
- HI, ALL!
- OHH, MOM AND DAD!

09:12.500 --> 09:15.100
- FELIZ NAVIDAD.

09:20.900 --> 09:23.667
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

09:27.133 --> 09:30.233
- [evil laugh]

09:35.767 --> 09:37.200
- HELLO, EVERYONE.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.767
- OH, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

09:38.767 --> 09:39.967
I WAS GETTING WORRIED.

09:39.967 --> 09:42.600
- THE BLOODY PARKWAY
WAS COMPLETELY JAMMED.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.500
I MEAN JAMMED!

09:46.100 --> 09:47.967
- HELLO, ROBERT.

09:47.967 --> 09:49.733
- [unenthusiastic]
HELLO.

09:50.833 --> 09:53.533
- OH, MARIE,
ISN'T THIS EXCITING?

09:53.533 --> 09:55.567
A PICTURE OF ALL OF US.

09:55.567 --> 09:58.833
DO YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE
ANY PHOTOS OF US TOGETHER?

09:58.833 --> 10:01.567
- I WONDER WHY THAT IS.

10:02.633 --> 10:05.267
RAYMOND, COULD I SEE YOU
FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?

10:05.267 --> 10:07.433
- OW, OW.
NAILS, NAILS, NAILS!

10:08.567 --> 10:09.733
- RAYMOND,

10:09.733 --> 10:12.800
YOU KNOW THAT I CARE FOR
DEBRA'S PARENTS A GREAT DEAL.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.200
- EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.833
- DON'T BE FRESH.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.600
WHY ARE
WARREN AND LOIS HERE?

10:19.600 --> 10:22.100
- I DON'T KNOW; I'M JUST
AS SURPRISED AS YOU ARE, MOM.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.833
- I'M NOT SURPRISED,
RAYMOND.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.267
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

10:26.267 --> 10:28.300
- NOW, ALL RIGHT.
NO, DON'T--

10:28.300 --> 10:29.867
DON'T GET DISAPPOINTED.

10:29.867 --> 10:32.533
- ISN'T THIS MYPRESENT?

10:32.533 --> 10:35.433
YOU FINALLY GOT ME
A DECENT PRESENT--

10:35.433 --> 10:37.900

PARA LA FOTOGRAFIA.

10:46.933 --> 10:48.333
[laughs]

10:48.333 --> 10:49.167
- OKAY.

10:49.167 --> 10:51.000
- THAT'S "HELLO, RAYMOND.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.133
I AM READY
FOR THE PHOTOGRAPH."

10:53.133 --> 10:56.600
I'M PRACTICING MY SPANISH
'CAUSE LOIS AND I ARE...

10:56.600 --> 11:00.333
ON OUR WAY
TO BUENOS AIRES.

11:00.333 --> 11:03.733
- OH, YEAH?

11:03.733 --> 11:05.733
WHAT--WHAT TIME'S
THE FLIGHT?

11:05.733 --> 11:08.200
- WELL, IT WON'T BE
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS NOW.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.300
DESPUES DEL AÑO NUEVO.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.133
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S GREAT, THAT'S GREAT.

11:13.133 --> 11:15.867
- I BROUGHT ANOTHER PASHMINA

11:15.867 --> 11:17.400
IN CASE YOU WANT
TO WEAR ONE TOO.

11:17.400 --> 11:22.000
- OH, THAT COULD BE SO CUTE!
MATCHING PASHMINAS.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.200
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.200
OH, THIS IS SUCH FUN,
RAYMOND.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.300
- YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.133
WHAT'S WITH
YOUR PARENTS?

11:31.133 --> 11:33.367
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- M-MY MOM'S ALL UPSET.

11:33.367 --> 11:35.167
SHE DIDN'T KNOW YOUR PARENTS
WERE GONNA BE IN THE PICTURE.

11:35.167 --> 11:37.867
- WELL, OF COURSE THEY'RE
GONNA BE IN THE PICTURE.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.033
- YOU TOLD THEM
TO COME?

11:39.033 --> 11:40.367
- WELL, YES, RAY.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.033
I MEAN, YOU SAID
"FAMILY PHOTO," SO...

11:43.033 --> 11:44.300
FAMILY PHOTO.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.100
- BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN
TELL ME.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.400
- WELL, I ASSUMED YOU KNEW

11:47.400 --> 11:50.467
THAT MY PARENTS
WERE PART OF THE FAMILY.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.967
- OKAY, YES, I KNEW,

11:52.967 --> 11:54.500
BUT YOU HAD TO KNOW
THAT MY MOM

11:54.500 --> 11:56.933
WOULD GO ALL
"DOG DAY AFTERNOON"ON US

11:56.933 --> 12:01.067
IF--IF--IF YOUR PARENTS
ARE IN HER PICTURE.

12:01.067 --> 12:02.900
- WELL...UH...

12:02.900 --> 12:04.900
- OHHH...

12:04.900 --> 12:07.333
OH-H-H-H...

12:07.333 --> 12:08.133
- WHAT?

12:08.133 --> 12:09.267
WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

12:09.267 --> 12:10.800
- YOU DID KNOW
SHE WOULD HATE THIS.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.967
YOU DIDKNOW.

12:12.967 --> 12:16.000
SABOTAGE.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.200
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

12:17.200 --> 12:18.933
- WHY--WHY ARE
YOUR PARENTS HERE?

12:18.933 --> 12:23.100
- BECAUSE THEY'RE
PART OF THE FAMILY, RAY.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.033
AND SINCE I WON'T BE
SEEING THEM AT CHRISTMAS--

12:25.033 --> 12:27.233
- OHHH...

12:27.233 --> 12:28.233
OKAY.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.567
LITTLE DEBBIE'S
REVENGE.

12:29.567 --> 12:31.100
YOU--YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET BACK AT ME

12:31.100 --> 12:32.333
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
"SUPPORT" YOU

12:32.333 --> 12:34.400
WITH YOUR LITTLE STUPID
CHRISTMAS DAY THING.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.100
- IT IS NOT STUPID
FOR ME TO WANT TO BE

12:36.100 --> 12:38.200
WITH MY FAMILY AT CHRISTMAS
INSTEAD OF YOURS.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.667
- INSTEAD OF MINE.
YOU SAID INSTEAD OF MINE.

12:39.667 --> 12:41.433
THAT MEANS YOU DON'T EVEN
WANT TO BE WITH MINE AT ALL.

12:41.433 --> 12:44.533
- I AM WITH THEM EVERY DAY!
- WELL, SO AM I!

12:45.733 --> 12:47.167
[clapping]

12:47.167 --> 12:49.400
- OKAY, EVERYBODY, WE'RE
ALMOST READY FOR THE GROWNUPS.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.767
- HEY, SNAPS.

12:50.767 --> 12:52.433
- OFFICER BARONE!

12:52.433 --> 12:54.367
HEY, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SINCE I LEFT THE FORCE.

12:54.367 --> 12:56.433
- YEAH, WELL,
I MADE SERGEANT.

12:56.433 --> 13:00.500
SO YOU'RE TAKING PICTURES
OF THE LIVING NOW, HUH?

13:00.500 --> 13:01.833
- YEAH, MOSTLY.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.033
WHAT WAS OUR LAST
JOB TOGETHER?

13:03.033 --> 13:04.867
WHAT WAS IT,
THE BRONX?

13:04.867 --> 13:06.567
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH.

13:06.567 --> 13:08.533
DECAPITATION.

13:08.533 --> 13:10.800
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.367
[both laughing]

13:15.167 --> 13:16.500
- CAN WE JUST
TAKE THE PICTURE?

13:16.500 --> 13:18.500
- LOOK, YOU BETTER
GO TELL YOUR PARENTS

13:18.500 --> 13:21.067
THAT THIS IS NOT COOL.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.267
- I CERTAINLY WILL NOT.

13:24.267 --> 13:26.400
WHY DON'T YOU TELL YOUR MOTHER
SHE BETTER ACCEPT THE FACT

13:26.400 --> 13:27.833
THAT SHE DOES NOT
GET TO DECIDE

13:27.833 --> 13:30.133
WHO IS IN AND OUT
OF THIS FAMILY.

13:30.133 --> 13:33.233
- JUST TALK
TO YOUR MOTHER.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.400
- YOU TALK TO YOUR MOTHER.

13:43.267 --> 13:45.333
- HEY, HOW MUCH LONGER?
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:45.333 --> 13:46.533
A COUPLE MINUTES.
LOOK, I GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

13:46.533 --> 13:48.800
- I CAN'T TAKE
THAT WARREN ANYMORE.

13:48.800 --> 13:52.533
SEÑOR WINDBAG.
- ALL RIGHT.

13:52.533 --> 13:55.100
- HE KEEPS TELLING ME
ABOUT HIS LATEST COLLECTION.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.600
VINTAGE WALKING STICKS.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.833
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

13:58.833 --> 14:00.300
- TALK ABOUT
A WASTE OF MONEY.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.767
HE DOESN'T EVEN LIMP.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.433
- JUST GO
BE NICE TO HIM.

14:04.433 --> 14:06.733
- HE'S EVEN GOT ONE
THAT HOLDS BOOZE IN IT.

14:06.733 --> 14:08.633
SURPRISE!

14:12.700 --> 14:15.033
- HEY, MA.
HOW YOU DOING?

14:15.033 --> 14:16.233
- DID YOU TALK
TO DEBRA?

14:16.233 --> 14:17.767
- YES, I DID.
WE HAD A GREAT TALK.

14:17.767 --> 14:18.867
NOW, HERE'S THE THING--

14:18.867 --> 14:21.767
- RAYMOND--
- NO, JUST LISTEN, MOM.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.233
IT'S--IT'S CHRISTMAS.

14:25.233 --> 14:27.600
YOU KNOW, YOU--
YOU LOVE CHRISTMAS.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.933
REMEMBER--REMEMBER
THAT CHRISTMAS MOVIE,

14:29.933 --> 14:31.367
"A CHRISTMAS CAROL?"

14:31.367 --> 14:33.133
HUH? REMEMBER
THE LITTLE CRIPPLED BOY,

14:33.133 --> 14:34.633
AND HE SAID--HE SAID,

14:34.633 --> 14:38.733
"MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL,
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT."

14:38.733 --> 14:41.333
SO--SO HE WANTS US...

14:41.333 --> 14:44.100
ALL...

14:44.100 --> 14:46.200
TO HAVE A GOOD...

14:48.600 --> 14:51.667
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

14:51.667 --> 14:53.533
WE PUT HER PARENTS
AT THE EDGE OF THE PICTURE,

14:53.533 --> 14:56.467
AND LATER,
YOU CAN CUT 'EM OUT.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.900
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, RAYMOND.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.333
I'M NOT FEELING
VERY WELL.

15:08.067 --> 15:11.267
WHY DON'T YOU ALL
TAKE THE PICTURE WITHOUT ME?

15:11.267 --> 15:13.700
- MOM!
I DID THIS FOR YOU, MOM.

15:13.700 --> 15:14.900
I DID IT FOR YOU.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.333
- I THOUGHT SO TOO.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.267
- ALL RIGHT, JUST WAIT HERE.
WAIT HERE.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.633
- EXCUSE ME, RAY,
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

15:22.633 --> 15:23.433
- WHAT?

15:23.433 --> 15:24.667
- AMY CAN'T BE
IN THE PICTURE,

15:24.667 --> 15:27.633
BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM
FOR HOITY AND TOITY?

15:31.933 --> 15:33.133
- WHAT?
I DON'T CARE--

15:33.133 --> 15:34.533
I DON'T CARE IF AMY'S
IN IT OR NOT.

15:34.533 --> 15:35.600
TALK TO MOM.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.300
- WELL, YOU SEE, I WOULD,
BUT SHE'S PRETTY UPSET.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.700
NICE GIFT.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.233
- OKAY, EVERYBODY.
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

15:45.233 --> 15:48.000
- YEAH, OKAY.
SURE, SURE.

15:48.967 --> 15:50.900
ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.433
SHE'S CRYING.

15:53.433 --> 15:55.833
- SHE IS NOT.

15:55.833 --> 15:58.267
- SHE'S GOT
THE DRY CRIES.

16:01.233 --> 16:02.233
- RAY.

16:02.233 --> 16:03.433
- AS SOON AS I GET
THE ADULTS IN,

16:03.433 --> 16:04.633
THEN I CAN BRING IN
THE KIDS.

16:04.633 --> 16:05.833
- RIGHT.
NO PROBLEM.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.800
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME?
- NO.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.100
- THIS IS SO TYPICAL
OF YOUR MOTHER.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.400
IT'S EITHER HER WAY
OR NO WAY.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.000
THIS PICTURE,
WHERE WE SPEND THE HOLIDAYS,

16:13.000 --> 16:14.200
HOW I RAISE MY CHILDREN.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.433
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
NOT THIS TIME.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.233
- OH...COME ON.

16:18.233 --> 16:21.100
YOU'RE KILLIN' ME HERE!

16:21.100 --> 16:23.433
THIS IS THE--THE--
THE FIRST GIFT I'M GETTING HER

16:23.433 --> 16:25.833
THAT EVEN HAS
A CHANCE OF WORKING.

16:25.833 --> 16:28.100
REMEMBER THE TOASTER?
HUH?

16:28.100 --> 16:29.600
THE--THE AQUARIUM?

16:29.600 --> 16:32.700
THE--THE FRUIT
OF THE FRICKIN' MONTH CLUB?

16:38.633 --> 16:40.467
DON'T YOU SEE?

16:40.467 --> 16:43.267
I-I THOUGHT SHE
WOULD LIKE THIS BECAUSE...

16:43.267 --> 16:46.067
SHE TOLD ME SHE WOULD.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.200
COME ON, HEY, LOOK,
JUST TAKE THE PICTURE,

16:49.200 --> 16:52.300
AND THEN I'LL DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

16:52.300 --> 16:53.733
- ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL TAKE THE PICTURE.

16:53.733 --> 16:54.633
- THANK YOU.

16:54.633 --> 16:56.767
- AS LONG AS MY PARENTS
CAN BE IN IT TOO.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.200
- [whimpers]

16:59.500 --> 17:00.533
ACCH--

17:00.533 --> 17:03.100
[screaming silently]

17:12.567 --> 17:15.000
FINE, OKAY.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.400
THEY'RE IN.
THEY'RE IN.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.633
THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

17:17.633 --> 17:19.100
NOW, IF WE COULD
JUST PLEASE GET OVER THERE.

17:19.100 --> 17:21.033
PLEASE, COME ON.
COME ON.

17:21.033 --> 17:22.800
DID I TELL YOU
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU LOOK?

17:22.800 --> 17:25.567
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
YOU'RE LIKE A NICE LITTLE PEACH.

17:25.567 --> 17:26.867
OKAY.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.867
HAD ENOUGH COOKIES,
AND JUST STRAIGHTEN THE TIE.

17:31.867 --> 17:34.400
- HEY, IT'S TOO TIGHT!
YOU'RE POPPIN' MY HEAD OFF.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.067
- [chuckling]

17:36.067 --> 17:38.233
YEAH, WE WOULDN'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

17:38.233 --> 17:39.233
OKAY.

17:39.233 --> 17:41.067
WARREN,
VAYA CON DIOS.

17:41.067 --> 17:43.300
- ACTUALLY, RAYMOND,
THAT MEANS, "GO WITH GOD."

17:43.300 --> 17:44.400
- YEAH, WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.300
I LEARNED SOMETHING NEW
TODAY, OKAY.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.367
RIGHT OVER THERE,
VAYA CON FRANCO.

17:48.367 --> 17:51.533

17:58.533 --> 18:00.600

YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA CHANGE.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.733
- I DECIDED NOT TO.

18:04.400 --> 18:08.233
- LOOK, IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THAT AMY'S NOT IN THE PICTURE.

18:08.233 --> 18:09.467
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.233
DEBRA'S NOT ALLOWED
IN YOUR HAMMOCK.

18:11.233 --> 18:13.767
- YOU'RE NOT EITHER.

18:13.767 --> 18:14.967
- FINE.

18:14.967 --> 18:16.500
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
LEAVE YOUR UNIFORM ON.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.533
JUST GET OVER THERE.

18:17.533 --> 18:19.600
- GET OVER THERE WHAT?

18:19.600 --> 18:22.433

18:24.000 --> 18:25.800

18:25.800 --> 18:29.433
YOU'LL FIND THAT A LITTLE
KINDNESS GOES A LONG WAY.

18:29.433 --> 18:30.733
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.433
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ALMOST EVERYBODY.

18:47.367 --> 18:48.367
- ALL RIGHT, MA,

18:48.367 --> 18:50.567
LOOKS LIKE
IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT.

18:50.567 --> 18:52.600
- IT DOESN'T
LOOK THAT WAY, RAYMOND.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.900
- NO.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.833
NO, NO, IT IS.

18:55.833 --> 18:57.333
IT IS.
[sniffs] OH, YOU SMELL NICE.

18:57.333 --> 18:59.233
WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT A NEW PERFUME?

18:59.233 --> 19:01.667
- NO, IT'S WHAT
I ALWAYS WEAR.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.867
IT'S MY JEAN NATE.

19:03.867 --> 19:06.133
- OH.

19:06.133 --> 19:10.000
OH, I'VE ALWAYS--
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THAT.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
AND I GOT TO--
I GOT TO SAY SOMETHING.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.400
YOU KNOW,
I'VE NEVER TOLD YOU THIS,

19:13.400 --> 19:15.967
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF MY
FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT YOU IS?

19:15.967 --> 19:17.167

19:17.167 --> 19:19.533

I JUST LOVE THE WAY

19:24.433 --> 19:26.667
YOU'RE JUST SO OPEN-MINDED
AND CONSIDERATE,

19:26.667 --> 19:28.667
ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.900
- RAYMOND, YOU ARE PUTTING ME
INTO A VERY AWKWARD SITUATION.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.100
- NO, I'M NOT.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.767
I'M PUTTING YOU
INTO YOUR CHRISTMAS PICTURE,

19:34.767 --> 19:35.900
WHICH YOU'RE GONNA LOVE.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.567
HEY, EVERYBODY, LOOK.
IT'S MOM.

19:40.633 --> 19:44.533
IF YOU COULD JUST--
PLEASE, JUST TRY TO SMILE.

19:44.533 --> 19:45.900
- I WILL, RAYMOND.

19:45.900 --> 19:49.000
BUT THIS IS NOT
THE PRESENT I WANTED.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.167
- RAYMOND,
I JUST NOTICED

19:54.167 --> 19:56.267
THAT THIS BACKGROUND
IS BLUE.

19:56.267 --> 19:59.667
DO I HAVE TIME TO CHANGE
INTO MY GRAY PASHMINA?

20:01.233 --> 20:03.667
- GET BACK IN YOUR PLACE!

20:05.367 --> 20:07.533
WE'RE TAKIN'
THIS DAMN PICTURE!

20:07.533 --> 20:09.567
DON'T YOU SEE WHAT
I'M DEALING WITH HERE?

20:09.567 --> 20:10.367
ARE YOU BLIND?

20:10.367 --> 20:12.667
- UH, RAYMOND--
- BAAHHH!

20:12.667 --> 20:16.233
NO HABLA TALKY-TALKY.
OKAY?

20:16.233 --> 20:17.433
I'VE HAD IT WITH--WITH--

20:17.433 --> 20:19.100
WITH TRYING TO MAKE
EVERYBODY HAPPY.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.800
I WAS TRYING
TO DO SOMETHING NICE!

20:20.800 --> 20:23.000
I'M--I'M SICK OF EVERYBODY
COMING UP TO ME--

20:23.000 --> 20:25.133
"OH, TALK TO DEBRA."
"TALK TO YOUR MOTHER."

20:25.133 --> 20:27.733
"WHY CAN'T MY GIRLFRIEND
BE IN THE PICTURE?"

20:27.733 --> 20:29.567
"OH, I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
CHRISTMAS WITH THEM."

20:29.567 --> 20:31.567
"OH, FIX IT, RAYMOND--TALK."
I'M DONE TALKING.

20:31.567 --> 20:33.233
DON'T TALK TO ME ANYMORE,
YOU HEAR ME?

20:33.233 --> 20:34.867
IF YOU WANT TO TALK,
TALK TO YOURSELVES,

20:34.867 --> 20:36.700
'CAUSE I'M OUT!

20:48.400 --> 20:51.167
- MAYBE I'LL JUST
WEAR THE BLUE.

20:53.833 --> 20:56.067
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.

20:56.067 --> 20:57.467
- I DON'T THINK WE BETTER--

20:57.467 --> 20:59.267
- WE'RE TAKING THE PICTURE.
WE'RE TAKING THE PICTURE.

20:59.267 --> 21:00.967
- LISTEN, IF YOU NEED
5 MINUTES, I CAN--

21:00.967 --> 21:02.833
- NO, NO, TAKE THE PICTURE.
TAKE THE PICTURE.

21:02.833 --> 21:05.033
- OH, ALL RIGHT.
LOOK OVER HERE.

21:05.033 --> 21:06.433
GIVE ME A BIG SMILE

21:06.433 --> 21:07.800
AND SAY, "MERRY"--

21:07.800 --> 21:09.967
- TAKE THE DAMN PICTURE.

21:09.967 --> 21:12.067
- ALL RIGHTY.
ONE, TWO--

21:12.067 --> 21:13.367
[shutter clicks]

21:21.567 --> 21:22.767
NOW WE'RE WARMING UP.

21:22.767 --> 21:25.867
THESE ARE LIVING PEOPLE.
ALL RIGHT.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.100
ONE MORE.
HERE WE GO.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.300
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
SMILE, EVERYBODY.

21:30.300 --> 21:34.067
WE DON'T WANT RAYMOND
TO THROW ANOTHER HISSY FIT.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.867
[chuckling]

21:36.867 --> 21:38.800
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.067
ALL RIGHT.
ONE FOR THE MANTEL, NOW.

21:41.067 --> 21:44.100
- [imitating Ray]
NOBODY TALK TO ME ANYMORE!

21:44.100 --> 21:46.367
[all laughing]

21:46.367 --> 21:47.200
[shutter clicks]

21:47.200 --> 21:50.067
- VERY GOOD!
VERY GOOD.

21:50.067 --> 21:51.600
ONE, TWO...

21:51.600 --> 21:53.400
- ROBERT GOT YOU
A HAMMOCK.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.333
