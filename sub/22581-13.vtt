00:08.398 --> 00:10.818
Good morning, everyone.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:20.582 --> 00:23.378
Be patient.

00:40.486 --> 00:42.823
Someone had a busy night.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.461
Don't worry.

00:54.339 --> 00:56.174
Didn't forget you.

01:05.229 --> 01:09.944
Let's try it without
biting my fingers this time.

01:23.964 --> 01:29.263
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:31.767 --> 01:35.147
"It's been a long time"

01:35.397 --> 01:39.195
"But my time is finally near"

01:39.445 --> 01:43.700
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:43.910 --> 01:46.830
"I will touch the sky"

01:46.997 --> 01:50.794
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

01:51.003 --> 01:54.007
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

01:54.216 --> 01:58.931
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

01:59.139 --> 02:02.060
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

02:02.268 --> 02:06.858
"I've got faith to believe"

02:07.067 --> 02:09.654
"I can do anything"

02:09.863 --> 02:14.327
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:14.578 --> 02:17.457
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:17.666 --> 02:22.965
"I can reach any star"

02:23.340 --> 02:27.096
"I've got faith"

02:27.304 --> 02:31.018
"I've got faith"

02:31.227 --> 02:36.025
"Faith of the heart"

02:47.834 --> 02:49.627
People are getting jealous.

02:51.046 --> 02:55.219
You get more letters from home
than anyone on this ship.

02:55.470 --> 02:56.679
What's her name?

02:57.014 --> 02:59.141
It's nothing like that.
They're from Dr Lucas.

02:59.350 --> 03:01.687
He's a colleague from
the Interspecies Medical Exchange.

03:01.979 --> 03:04.357
I didn't know there were humans
serving on Denobula.

03:04.649 --> 03:06.319
He's the first.
He helped me get settled in

03:06.569 --> 03:09.198
when I came to San Francisco.
I'm trying to return the favour.

03:09.448 --> 03:11.785
I had a pen pal once,
when I was 12.

03:11.951 --> 03:15.874
From Brisbane, Australia.
And I loved getting her letters.

03:16.124 --> 03:20.798
It was like this little window into distant
places with strange-sounding names.

03:21.298 --> 03:24.302
The curiosity of an explorer,
even then.

03:24.511 --> 03:27.557
- Are we still on for later?
- Oh, yes.

03:27.766 --> 03:29.434
I'm looking forward to it.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.481
If you think you're ready,
we can tackle gerunds today.

03:32.731 --> 03:34.358
I can hardly wait.

03:41.576 --> 03:44.665
My dear Dr Phlox,
it's me again, Jeremy.

03:44.873 --> 03:47.627
I hope you're well.
It's been a hell of a week here.

03:47.836 --> 03:50.714
Wall-to-wall emergencies
and three midnight deliveries.

03:50.881 --> 03:53.594
It's mating season,
so you know how that goes.

03:53.803 --> 03:56.348
I thought human reproduction
was complicated.

03:56.598 --> 04:00.563
You Denobulans make us look
like single-cell organisms.

04:04.317 --> 04:07.488
Dear Dr Lucas, sorry to hear
about your dificult week.

04:07.698 --> 04:10.535
I know the rigours
of mating season only too well.

04:10.743 --> 04:13.164
It might help to bear in mind
that a dose of niaxilin

04:13.372 --> 04:17.295
can be quite efective
in separating the two combatants.

04:17.503 --> 04:19.964
It sounds like you've settled
in to your new living quarters.

04:20.173 --> 04:23.845
That part of the city has some
very lively Kaybin bars along the river.

04:24.054 --> 04:26.056
Up here, doc.

04:26.223 --> 04:28.226
They are open all night, if I recall.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.354
Please don't
venture inside them unescorted.

04:30.605 --> 04:34.027
They can be quite disturbing
to the uninitiated.

04:34.819 --> 04:37.281
He was trying to reroute
a nitrogen valve, and the seal blew.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.035
How bad is it?

04:45.543 --> 04:47.253
Oh, it's superficial.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.673
Only first-degree burns.

04:49.882 --> 04:53.304
A little dermaline gel
should do the trick.

04:53.513 --> 04:55.599
Most of my work is fairly routine.

04:55.808 --> 04:58.394
Scrapes and bruises,
the occasional emergency.

04:58.645 --> 05:00.940
And you'll be pleased to hear
that the crew finally seems

05:01.148 --> 05:04.445
to be growing accustomed
to an alien doctor onboard.

05:04.695 --> 05:07.157
I must admit, I wasn't planning
to stay this long,

05:07.366 --> 05:09.077
but the opportunity
to observe your species

05:09.244 --> 05:12.873
on their first deep-space venture
has proven irresistible.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.837
Lieutenant, I saved a seat for you.

05:16.003 --> 05:19.007
Yeah, another time, doctor.
I'm due back in the armoury.

05:21.177 --> 05:24.557
It's a bit daunting, at times,
trying to socialize with the crew,

05:24.723 --> 05:25.976
form friendships.

05:26.184 --> 05:28.688
But our profession guarantees
that sooner or later,

05:28.896 --> 05:30.274
everyone comes to see us.

05:30.482 --> 05:33.653
It makes interaction
quite a bit easier.

05:33.862 --> 05:37.033
It's just a little
gastrointestinal distress.

05:39.704 --> 05:42.457
He hasn't been himself lately.

05:42.708 --> 05:46.630
Well, you've been feeding him
cheese again, haven't you?

05:46.839 --> 05:49.176
You've got to learn
how to say no, captain.

05:49.426 --> 05:52.221
No more dairy products,
you hear that? Doctor's orders.

05:52.430 --> 05:55.726
I never thought I'd meet a species
that forges such intimate bonds

05:55.935 --> 05:57.145
with lesser creatures.

05:57.353 --> 06:01.776
It's surprising the things you humans
choose to invest your emotions in.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.281
- Sorry to bother you with this.
- No bother.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.785
He was one of my
more cooperative patients today.

06:09.162 --> 06:10.956
Thanks, doc.

06:11.999 --> 06:14.711
See all the trouble you cause?

06:14.962 --> 06:17.758
I've noticed how the captain
seems to anthropomorphize his pet.

06:17.966 --> 06:20.261
He even talks to the creature,
although I'm fairly certain

06:20.428 --> 06:22.765
it has no idea what he's saying.

06:23.015 --> 06:28.189
Then again, I've been known to speak
to my Pyrithian bat on occasion.

06:28.439 --> 06:30.567
We won't be going
to America this time.

06:30.776 --> 06:33.196
But always I go with you
wherever you go.

06:33.404 --> 06:35.282
Understand?

06:35.574 --> 06:37.410
- You go now, Maria.
- No.

06:37.702 --> 06:40.206
- No, I stay with you, Roberto.
- No, Maria.

06:40.414 --> 06:41.416
What I do now, I do alone.

06:41.708 --> 06:43.878
I couldn't do it if you were here.

06:44.087 --> 06:47.633
If you go, then I go too.
Don't you see how it is?

06:47.801 --> 06:49.052
Whichever one there is...

06:49.261 --> 06:50.346
No! No!

06:50.596 --> 06:52.223
We can go if you're bored.

06:52.432 --> 06:55.562
No, no, I'd like to stay
and see what happens.

06:57.565 --> 06:58.816
You won't be disappointed.

06:59.066 --> 07:00.861
The ending's classic.

07:01.069 --> 07:02.697
No, not the film.

07:02.947 --> 07:05.576
I'm sensing a rising
emotional undercurrent in the room.

07:05.784 --> 07:10.666
I'm curious to see if it culminates
in some kind of group response.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.378
They don't have movies
where you come from, do they?

07:13.629 --> 07:15.590
We had something similar
a few hundred years ago,

07:15.798 --> 07:18.386
but they lost their appeal when
people discovered their real lives

07:18.636 --> 07:20.388
were more interesting.

07:21.891 --> 07:22.933
Still,

07:23.184 --> 07:26.272
it's nice to take a break from real life
every now and then, don't you think?

07:27.023 --> 07:28.275
I suppose it is.

07:28.609 --> 07:32.656
Remember last night?
Our time is now.

07:34.951 --> 07:37.246
You are me now, and I am you.

07:39.165 --> 07:41.126
Now you understand.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.879
Now you're going.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.508
And you're going well
and fast and far.

07:46.801 --> 07:48.470
Something in my eye.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.182
Stand up now and go,
and we both go.

07:51.350 --> 07:53.686
Stand up, Maria.
Remember, you're me too.

07:53.937 --> 07:56.607
It's remarkable, doctor.
Even fictional characters

07:56.815 --> 07:59.152
seem to elicit human compassion.

07:59.402 --> 08:01.739
My shipmates have calmly faced
any number of dangers,

08:01.989 --> 08:06.246
and yet, a simple movie
can bring tears to their eyes.

08:10.919 --> 08:14.006
- Temporal vein.
- Temporal vein.

08:14.257 --> 08:15.342
Internal maxillary.

08:15.634 --> 08:18.263
And what is the maxillary
connected to?

08:19.765 --> 08:23.687
- Posterior auricular?
- Very good.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.274
The external jugular.

08:27.734 --> 08:29.904
Superior vena cava.

08:30.154 --> 08:31.824
- And that leads to?
- Oh, easy.

08:32.073 --> 08:35.160
The seat of all joy and sadness.

08:36.330 --> 08:40.251
Physiologically, it is nothing more
than a very efficient pump.

08:40.501 --> 08:44.758
What could possibly make you people
think it is the source of all emotion?

08:45.009 --> 08:48.180
Now, you may know about
our cardiopulmonary system,

08:48.431 --> 08:51.435
but you have a lot to learn
about the human heart.

08:51.768 --> 08:53.438
This is me.

08:55.232 --> 08:57.986
- Good night.
- Oh, doctor.

08:58.194 --> 09:00.489
I just wanted to thank you.

09:00.740 --> 09:04.286
- It was fun tonight.
- You're welcome.

09:04.537 --> 09:07.666
They're showing another one
next week. Sunset Boulevard.

09:07.917 --> 09:11.547
- Think you might like it.
- I'm sure I will.

09:12.048 --> 09:14.217
See you tomorrow? Oh, sorry.

09:14.426 --> 09:17.347
I forgot, Denobulans don't like
to be touched.

09:17.555 --> 09:18.766
It's all right.

09:19.016 --> 09:22.520
I'm trying to shed
some of my cultural inhibitions.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.315
Well, in that case...

09:25.358 --> 09:26.944
...good night.

09:34.412 --> 09:36.499
Since we were
on the subject of mating,

09:36.791 --> 09:40.463
I think Crewman Cutler may be
romantically interested in me.

09:40.713 --> 09:42.383
I can't be certain, however.

09:42.633 --> 09:47.431
The pheromones of human females
aren't as potent as Denobulans'.

09:53.731 --> 09:56.736
Are there any
inhabited systems nearby?

09:59.699 --> 10:02.536
There's a Minshara-class planet
less than a light year away.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.206
The ship's not answering
our hails, captain.

10:05.456 --> 10:07.459
It's definitely pre-warp, sir.

10:07.751 --> 10:08.920
It could be unmanned.

10:09.546 --> 10:11.173
Maybe a probe of some kind.

10:11.424 --> 10:13.468
Any bio-signs?

10:20.770 --> 10:24.025
Two. But they're very faint.

10:26.737 --> 10:29.575
Bring it into Launch Bay 2.

10:29.825 --> 10:33.371
And tell Dr Phlox
he might have a couple of patients.

10:49.102 --> 10:52.357
We found your ship adrift.

10:52.607 --> 10:55.070
We thought we might
be able to help.

11:03.748 --> 11:05.751
I need a little more.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.295
I'm Jonathan Archer.

11:07.504 --> 11:09.382
You're on the starship Enterprise.

11:18.394 --> 11:19.396
Can you understand me?

11:22.149 --> 11:23.777
Who are you?

11:24.778 --> 11:26.948
- What planet?
- Earth.

11:27.156 --> 11:28.283
We're from Earth.

11:29.702 --> 11:32.580
This is a warp vessel?

11:33.499 --> 11:34.625
Yes.

11:37.337 --> 11:40.759
We left Valakis over a year ago,
along with three other ships.

11:41.093 --> 11:42.094
Why?

11:43.388 --> 11:45.766
You must have noticed
our condition by now.

11:45.933 --> 11:48.228
I detected the illness.

11:48.603 --> 11:51.107
Twelve million of us died
the year before we left.

11:51.566 --> 11:53.902
I can only imagine
how many have died since.

11:54.112 --> 11:55.989
Our doctors can't find a cure.

11:56.197 --> 11:58.451
But a more advanced people,

11:58.660 --> 12:01.539
people with warp technology,
like you,

12:01.789 --> 12:04.585
your medical science
must be more effective.

12:05.377 --> 12:07.505
You've encountered other
warp-capable species?

12:07.797 --> 12:09.383
The M'klexa.

12:09.592 --> 12:13.139
And the Ferengi.
They both visited our world.

12:13.348 --> 12:15.058
Do you know them?

12:17.645 --> 12:18.772
No.

12:21.525 --> 12:24.488
- Are you the ship's doctor?
- I am.

12:25.823 --> 12:27.326
My people are dying.

12:29.078 --> 12:30.455
Will you allow him to help us?

12:37.215 --> 12:39.259
Any thoughts?

12:41.721 --> 12:43.306
They did come looking for us.

12:43.516 --> 12:48.231
And considering they've already met
two other warp-capable species...

12:50.693 --> 12:55.533
...the risk of contamination
seems acceptable.

12:58.412 --> 12:59.538
See what you can do.

13:00.832 --> 13:02.418
Thank you.

13:05.964 --> 13:09.553
If this letter arrives later than usual,
doctor, I hope you'll forgive me.

13:09.803 --> 13:11.848
I've been presented
with a rather unusual case

13:12.056 --> 13:14.560
involving a pair of alien astronauts.

13:15.310 --> 13:17.522
It may not surprise you
that they landed in my Sickbay

13:17.731 --> 13:20.818
through an act
of human compassion.

13:27.536 --> 13:31.083
I said before that my duties entail
the occasional emergency.

13:31.625 --> 13:34.546
Emergencies, it seem,
come in all shapes and sizes.

13:34.796 --> 13:37.091
I was once nearly overwhelmed
by 50 patients

13:37.258 --> 13:40.055
in a refugee camp on Matalas.

13:40.263 --> 13:45.812
Captain Archer is now asking me to
take responsibility for over 50 million.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.606
It's a nostril?

14:22.865 --> 14:26.870
I've noticed you and Crewman Cutler
spending a lot of time together.

14:27.872 --> 14:30.209
Is there something going on
between you two?

14:30.418 --> 14:32.170
In Denobulan, please.

14:42.059 --> 14:45.522
I believe the word
you're searching for is "dating."

14:48.109 --> 14:49.862
Well, are you?

15:02.547 --> 15:04.215
There are ways you can tell.

15:17.693 --> 15:19.404
To make physical contact?

15:19.780 --> 15:22.241
Well, she did kiss me
on the cheek the other night.

15:22.700 --> 15:24.912
In Denobulan, doctor.

15:39.891 --> 15:41.268
I beg your pardon?

15:41.519 --> 15:45.316
Couple. A cute couple.

15:56.791 --> 15:58.376
It's pretty crowded out there.

15:58.584 --> 16:01.297
A lot of spacecraft
and artificial satellites.

16:01.506 --> 16:03.591
Nothing I can't avoid, sir.

16:03.801 --> 16:07.055
Put us into low orbit, Travis.
They're expecting us.

16:07.639 --> 16:10.518
The captain has committed
all our resources to helping people

16:10.685 --> 16:13.606
he didn't even know existed
two days ago.

16:13.857 --> 16:17.736
Once again, I'm struck
by your species' desire to help others.

16:23.370 --> 16:25.415
It seems the more aggressively
we treat the illness,

16:25.623 --> 16:26.791
the more resistant it becomes.

16:27.041 --> 16:29.545
- What's the current rate of infection?
- One out of three.

16:29.754 --> 16:31.506
It's a full-blown epidemic.

16:31.715 --> 16:34.470
These are in
the most advanced stage.

16:36.013 --> 16:38.892
You're treating them
with a synthetic antibody?

16:39.101 --> 16:41.980
It's effective at first,
but the disease mutates.

16:42.189 --> 16:43.816
Once it moves into
the respiratory system,

16:44.025 --> 16:45.568
there's no way of controlling it.

16:45.735 --> 16:48.448
Pulmonary failure usually follows
in a few days.

16:48.615 --> 16:51.160
Captain, treatment with priaxate
should ease the symptoms

16:51.368 --> 16:53.914
in the sickest patients,
at least temporarily.

16:54.122 --> 16:57.710
I can easily show the Valakians how
to synthesize as much as they need.

16:57.961 --> 16:59.505
Go ahead.

16:59.713 --> 17:01.591
I'll need all of lab work you have,

17:01.841 --> 17:04.470
and case histories of patients
in every stage of the disease.

17:04.678 --> 17:06.348
Certainly.

17:17.405 --> 17:19.700
Excuse me. We're the ones
that brought him here.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.994
Can you tell me how he's doing?

17:24.999 --> 17:27.586
I'm sorry. Could you say that again?

17:31.050 --> 17:34.680
We should assign some crewmen
to watch Dr Phlox and his equipment.

17:34.930 --> 17:38.269
I don't think these people
are about to steal anything.

17:38.435 --> 17:42.900
Your experience with
lesser civilizations is limited, captain.

17:43.109 --> 17:46.697
You might be surprised what
a temptation our technology can be.

17:55.751 --> 17:56.753
Hoshi.

17:57.004 --> 17:59.549
Captain, the UT can't translate
his language.

18:02.344 --> 18:04.014
He doesn't speak
the same language as you?

18:04.222 --> 18:06.976
No. He's Menk.

18:07.185 --> 18:10.564
They're not as evolved as Valakians,
but they're very hard workers.

18:10.731 --> 18:13.527
They're indigenous to this planet?

18:13.694 --> 18:15.404
Is that so strange?

18:15.572 --> 18:17.657
On most of the planets
we've encountered,

18:17.908 --> 18:21.914
only one species of humanoid
survived the evolutionary process.

18:22.581 --> 18:24.918
You two are not from
the same planet?

18:26.670 --> 18:28.256
No.

18:29.007 --> 18:32.346
We may look alike,
but the similarity ends there.

18:32.596 --> 18:35.225
I don't see any Menk patients here.
Where are they being treated?

18:35.433 --> 18:37.102
They haven't contracted the disease.

18:38.354 --> 18:39.815
Have you looked into their immunity?

18:40.023 --> 18:42.068
It was one of the first things
we pursued,

18:42.276 --> 18:45.572
but Menk and Valakian
are physiologically incompatible.

18:45.823 --> 18:47.116
Still, it could be significant.

18:47.325 --> 18:49.620
I'd like to see your data
on the Menk as well.

18:49.787 --> 18:51.414
Of course.

18:52.207 --> 18:54.961
I had meant
to transmit this letter by now,

18:55.169 --> 18:58.967
but the Valakian epidemic
has been taking up most of my time.

18:59.175 --> 19:02.555
Working with the physicians here
has been quite fulfilling.

19:02.764 --> 19:06.727
I suppose it's the reason we joined
the Interspecies Medical Exchange.

19:06.978 --> 19:09.983
But I worry about
falsely raising their hopes.

19:10.191 --> 19:12.778
Despite Captain Archer's
confidence in me,

19:13.028 --> 19:18.619
I'm afraid the scale of the disaster
may outweigh our best intentions.

19:18.828 --> 19:22.542
I've decided to enlist
Crewman Cutler's help in my task.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.879
So, what are the Menk like?

19:25.087 --> 19:27.507
You'll have the chance
to see for yourself.

19:27.716 --> 19:30.303
You're a trained exobiologist.

19:30.511 --> 19:32.848
I'd find your assistance
in the field invaluable.

19:33.098 --> 19:34.184
Thank you, doctor.

19:34.392 --> 19:37.521
On a personal note, the afection
Crewman Cutler is showing

19:37.688 --> 19:39.774
has left me a bit perplexed.

19:40.025 --> 19:42.653
So I've decided to discuss it
with the one person onboard

19:42.863 --> 19:45.992
who might understand
the complexities of the situation.

19:46.409 --> 19:49.496
- That's impossible.
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.

19:49.705 --> 19:53.586
My teeth were sealed with a
tri-fluorinate compound 23 years ago.

19:53.794 --> 19:56.840
Well, normal wear and tear
has allowed some decay to sneak in.

19:57.091 --> 19:58.676
See for yourself.

19:59.762 --> 20:02.891
There, on your anterior tricuspid.

20:07.147 --> 20:10.276
I'm sure you have more pressing
concerns. I'll come back later.

20:10.485 --> 20:13.280
I'm waiting for the computer
to analyse some tissue samples.

20:13.490 --> 20:16.410
It'll only take a moment to repair.

20:25.047 --> 20:27.008
Open, please.

20:27.843 --> 20:29.679
Wider.

20:34.853 --> 20:38.525
You've lived among humans for quite
some time now, sub-commander.

20:38.733 --> 20:39.944
I'm curious,

20:40.152 --> 20:42.489
have you ever known them
to mate outside their species?

20:44.075 --> 20:45.785
There it is.

20:51.210 --> 20:53.129
Are you asking
out of personal interest

20:53.337 --> 20:55.507
or scientific curiosity?

20:56.676 --> 20:57.677
Both, I suppose.

20:57.844 --> 20:59.805
There's a crewman onboard
I've become close with.

21:00.055 --> 21:03.144
I think she's attracted to me.

21:03.352 --> 21:05.939
In my experience, humans lack...

21:06.148 --> 21:09.235
...the emotional maturity
for interspecies relationships.

21:09.444 --> 21:13.450
They tend to be easily infatuated
with things they find new.

21:13.658 --> 21:17.080
This crewman may simply be
satisfying her curiosity

21:17.289 --> 21:18.582
at your expense.

21:23.047 --> 21:24.633
Open.

21:24.841 --> 21:28.764
Sub-commander T'Pol has a very
pragmatic view of the universe.

21:29.014 --> 21:30.390
I admire her logic,

21:30.641 --> 21:33.646
although she lacks the instinctiveness
that a more emotional response

21:33.854 --> 21:35.564
can provide.

21:35.815 --> 21:38.694
Somehow, I find this unsettling.

21:38.861 --> 21:42.115
There. That wasn't so bad.

21:44.369 --> 21:47.289
Thanks for your insights.

21:47.498 --> 21:48.583
Be careful.

21:57.096 --> 21:58.430
Come in.

22:02.144 --> 22:04.106
You asked to see me, captain.

22:04.273 --> 22:06.484
I've just gotten a call
from the director of the clinic.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.280
He's eager to hear
if you've made any progress.

22:13.451 --> 22:14.453
Doctor?

22:16.748 --> 22:22.381
I've developed a medication
to ease the symptoms of the disease.

22:23.383 --> 22:24.926
But...

22:26.012 --> 22:27.513
But?

22:30.018 --> 22:34.774
This epidemic isn't being caused
by a virus or bacteria.

22:35.025 --> 22:38.613
The proteins that bind
their chromosomes are deteriorating.

22:38.821 --> 22:40.532
Their illness is genetic.

22:40.741 --> 22:43.244
It's been going on
for thousands of years,

22:43.453 --> 22:45.039
but the rate of mutation
has accelerated

22:45.205 --> 22:48.043
over the last few generations.

22:48.209 --> 22:50.421
Based on my projections,

22:50.630 --> 22:54.010
the Valakians will be extinct
in less than two centuries.

22:55.930 --> 22:58.475
I wish I had better news.

23:02.772 --> 23:04.024
What about a cure?

23:05.108 --> 23:08.906
Genetic abnormalities on this level
are very difficult to reverse.

23:09.698 --> 23:11.576
But not impossible.

23:12.077 --> 23:16.458
No. I still believe the Menk immunity
could be the key to a cure.

23:16.667 --> 23:18.795
I plan to study them in more detail.

23:19.253 --> 23:20.714
Take all the time you need.

23:39.157 --> 23:42.745
When I began to practice medicine,
I had no idea it would take me

23:42.912 --> 23:44.873
on journeys to other worlds.

23:45.124 --> 23:49.297
Every species I encounter allows me
to explore new physiology.

23:49.505 --> 23:51.758
At the moment, I find myself
in the enviable position

23:52.009 --> 23:55.055
of studying two humanoids
from the same planet.

23:55.264 --> 23:58.476
It's a rare and exciting opportunity.

24:00.479 --> 24:03.817
Tell them we'd like to run some tests,
take samples of their blood.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.446
It will be completely painless.

24:16.836 --> 24:19.298
He says they'd be happy to help.

24:19.798 --> 24:23.888
As fascinating as the two species are
from a biological standpoint,

24:24.096 --> 24:27.184
it's their ability to coexist
that intrigues me the most.

24:27.434 --> 24:30.898
The Valakians are highly evolved,
technologically advanced,

24:31.148 --> 24:34.945
while the Menk are relatively
primitive by comparison.

24:35.196 --> 24:40.328
To my surprise, the two seem
to be living side by side, peacefully.

25:04.862 --> 25:06.240
He wants to know
what you're doing.

25:07.491 --> 25:10.413
Have you learned enough Menk
to explain a molecular bio-scan?

25:11.455 --> 25:13.417
Doctor...

25:21.803 --> 25:22.972
What'd you say?

25:23.264 --> 25:25.892
Told him the doctor was looking
inside of him.

25:30.733 --> 25:32.694
Thank you.

25:36.783 --> 25:38.661
You're welcome.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.418
Food.

25:43.668 --> 25:47.298
- Did he just say "food"?
- Food.

25:47.548 --> 25:48.842
Have you been
teaching him English?

25:49.092 --> 25:51.763
No. He must've picked it up
by listening to us.

25:51.971 --> 25:55.393
Perhaps we've found
an assistant com officer.

25:57.313 --> 25:58.481
No food?

26:06.910 --> 26:10.831
I haven't seen any crops or livestock.
I wonder where they get this.

26:18.718 --> 26:21.806
He says the soil here
isn't good for planting.

26:28.357 --> 26:31.528
The Valakians don't let them live
where the land is fertile.

26:37.412 --> 26:39.205
The Valakians give them
whatever they need.

26:39.414 --> 26:41.083
Food, clothing, medicine.

26:45.798 --> 26:48.427
He says the Valakians
are good to them.

26:48.635 --> 26:50.555
They protect them.

27:00.235 --> 27:02.488
Despite the Menk's insistence
that they're treated well,

27:02.739 --> 27:06.536
my human crewmates
seem to see things diferently.

27:10.584 --> 27:12.879
Well, that's the last one.

27:13.087 --> 27:16.467
They think the Menk
are being exploited by the Valakians.

27:16.717 --> 27:19.637
So their first instinct
is to rise to their defence.

27:19.847 --> 27:24.896
Despite the fact that the Menk don't
appear to need or want a defender.

27:25.688 --> 27:26.647
Wait a moment.

27:32.615 --> 27:35.118
- Impressive.
- What'd he do?

27:35.410 --> 27:37.663
He's grouped
the samples together by family.

27:37.914 --> 27:41.544
Cross-referenced by bloodlines
and marriage,

27:41.795 --> 27:45.007
if I'm interpreting
the colour codes correctly.

27:48.096 --> 27:51.058
On the surface, the Menk appear
to be a primitive species,

27:51.308 --> 27:54.270
unsophisticated even
by human standards.

27:54.479 --> 27:56.524
No ofence.
But their abilities appear

27:56.732 --> 28:00.905
to have been underestimated,
even by myself.

28:02.324 --> 28:07.373
It seems like a vacation, if I didn't
keep remembering why we were here.

28:09.208 --> 28:11.545
I'm gonna help Larr
finish packing up.

28:11.712 --> 28:15.050
He's back on duty
at the hospital in an hour.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.310
This really doesn't bother you?

28:22.477 --> 28:23.896
What?

28:24.105 --> 28:26.734
The way the Valakians treat them.

28:26.942 --> 28:28.194
Why should it?

28:28.403 --> 28:30.196
On most worlds
with two humanoid species,

28:30.405 --> 28:32.491
one would've driven the other
to extinction.

28:32.700 --> 28:34.578
Here, they've developed
a symbiotic relationship

28:34.786 --> 28:36.914
that seems to work quite well.

28:37.081 --> 28:38.917
They force the Menk
to live in compounds.

28:39.126 --> 28:41.212
They treat them almost like pets.

28:41.421 --> 28:45.051
Their culture is different.
It's their way.

28:45.302 --> 28:47.263
Doesn't make it right.

28:48.681 --> 28:50.851
Are you married, crewman?

28:51.895 --> 28:53.104
Of course not.

28:53.354 --> 28:54.482
I would've told you.

28:54.648 --> 28:56.485
I'm married.

28:57.027 --> 28:59.947
- You are.
- Three times.

29:00.198 --> 29:02.451
You have two ex-wives?

29:02.659 --> 29:05.831
I have three current wives,
and they each have two husbands.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.502
Not counting myself.

29:08.710 --> 29:13.092
Is that considered normal
for Denobulans?

29:13.300 --> 29:14.927
Quite.

29:18.265 --> 29:19.475
Why are you telling me this?

29:20.685 --> 29:22.855
I've been getting certain signals
from you that suggest

29:23.022 --> 29:25.943
you may be interested
in a romantic relationship with me.

29:30.866 --> 29:33.662
Unless I misinterpreted
those signals.

29:34.288 --> 29:35.873
You didn't.

29:36.500 --> 29:40.713
But I still don't know why
you're telling me this.

29:42.341 --> 29:45.137
You need to know
that my culture is different.

29:45.387 --> 29:47.515
- That doesn't matter.
- It doesn't?

29:47.974 --> 29:49.017
This culture is different.

29:49.268 --> 29:51.104
That seems to matter to you
a great deal.

29:51.771 --> 29:53.399
Phlox...

29:55.318 --> 29:59.031
...as far as
your extended family goes,

29:59.240 --> 30:04.414
I'm not interested in becoming
wife number four.

30:05.249 --> 30:07.169
I just wanna be your friend.

30:10.381 --> 30:12.384
What do you mean by friend?

30:13.927 --> 30:16.849
Let's just see where it goes.

30:41.050 --> 30:42.803
Captain.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.014
I'm glad you could come.

30:45.681 --> 30:47.601
It was no problem.

30:49.938 --> 30:51.774
How are you feeling?

30:53.567 --> 30:55.862
The medication you gave us
helps with the pain.

30:57.281 --> 30:58.909
But my...

30:59.701 --> 31:02.539
...prognosis hasn't changed.

31:03.791 --> 31:06.461
We're trying to do something
about that.

31:06.670 --> 31:08.965
I have a lot of faith in Dr Phlox.

31:13.138 --> 31:16.725
I wanted to thank you for getting
me home before it was too late.

31:18.728 --> 31:20.606
Took us a year to get out
to where you found us.

31:20.815 --> 31:22.442
You brought us home in a day.

31:23.026 --> 31:27.408
We started out in ships
very similar to yours.

31:28.033 --> 31:31.288
Someday, you'll be travelling
just as fast as we are.

31:32.707 --> 31:34.585
Someday may not be soon enough.

31:35.836 --> 31:38.339
If your doctor can't help us...

31:39.675 --> 31:41.970
...we'll need to keep searching
for others that can.

31:45.057 --> 31:46.685
We need warp drive.

31:48.813 --> 31:52.610
A million more of us will die before
our next ship even leaves this system.

31:52.818 --> 31:56.282
With warp engines, we won't
have to wait for people to find us.

31:56.449 --> 31:58.452
We can seek help on our own.

31:59.828 --> 32:03.792
You may not find that everyone
you meet wants to help you.

32:04.794 --> 32:06.546
Still...

32:06.755 --> 32:08.508
...we have to try.

32:15.726 --> 32:18.313
- Archer.
- It's Phlox, captain.

32:18.563 --> 32:20.816
We've collected all the samples.

32:21.818 --> 32:24.405
I'll meet you at the shuttlepod.
Archer out.

32:51.235 --> 32:53.196
Anything to report?

32:53.446 --> 32:56.450
We've received 29 hails
in the past two hours.

32:56.660 --> 32:57.744
From whom?

32:57.911 --> 33:00.373
Apparently, word of our arrival
has spread quickly.

33:00.957 --> 33:03.127
Other clinics are requesting help.

33:03.377 --> 33:07.466
Two orbital spacecraft approached us
while you were on the planet.

33:07.633 --> 33:10.637
They mistakenly believed
that we already had a cure.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.101
We had to turn them away.

33:18.149 --> 33:20.151
Do you have a minute?

33:37.468 --> 33:40.639
The Valakians want
our warp technology.

33:42.308 --> 33:43.434
What did you tell them?

33:45.395 --> 33:47.815
That I'd think about it.

33:48.024 --> 33:49.693
And?

33:50.653 --> 33:53.366
It's safe to say I know
where you stand on the subject.

33:54.242 --> 33:56.870
Even if you give them
our reactor schematics,

33:57.079 --> 34:01.252
they don't have the technical expertise
to build a warp engine.

34:02.378 --> 34:05.466
They have no experience
working with antimatter.

34:06.342 --> 34:09.346
I doubt they even realize
how dangerous it is.

34:12.141 --> 34:13.393
They're not ready.

34:13.601 --> 34:16.398
Then your decision
shouldn't be difficult.

34:18.442 --> 34:20.237
We could...

34:21.196 --> 34:23.199
...stay and help them.

34:24.994 --> 34:28.415
The Vulcans stayed to help Earth
90 years ago.

34:29.208 --> 34:31.210
We're still there.

34:34.841 --> 34:37.511
I never thought I'd say this...

34:38.554 --> 34:42.686
...but I'm beginning to understand
how the Vulcans must have felt.

35:16.651 --> 35:21.032
- Trouble sleeping, captain?
- Looks like I'm not the only one.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.036
Actually...

35:24.245 --> 35:27.500
...Denobulans require very little rest.

35:27.708 --> 35:30.337
Unless you count
our annual hibernation cycle.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.800
Am I gonna be without
my doctor this winter?

35:34.050 --> 35:35.469
Only for six days.

35:36.428 --> 35:38.056
Maybe I'll join you.

35:40.977 --> 35:42.229
Any progress?

35:46.025 --> 35:49.781
The research has been challenging,
to say the least.

35:50.615 --> 35:52.451
A cure, doctor.

35:52.660 --> 35:53.996
Have you found a cure?

36:01.339 --> 36:03.718
Even if I could find one,

36:03.926 --> 36:06.054
I'm not sure it would be ethical.

36:06.805 --> 36:07.807
Ethical?

36:08.516 --> 36:11.020
We'd be interfering
with an evolutionary process

36:11.270 --> 36:13.815
that has been going on
for thousands of years.

36:15.401 --> 36:18.947
Every time you treat an illness,
you're interfering.

36:19.114 --> 36:20.742
That's what doctors do.

36:22.453 --> 36:24.039
You're forgetting about the Menk.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.459
What about the Menk?

36:26.667 --> 36:29.588
I've been studying
their genome, as well.

36:29.838 --> 36:31.883
And I've seen evidence
of increasing intelligence.

36:32.091 --> 36:33.761
Motor skills, linguistic abilities.

36:33.969 --> 36:36.765
Unlike the Valakians,
they appear to be in the process

36:36.973 --> 36:39.352
of an evolutionary awakening.

36:39.602 --> 36:42.689
It may take millennia,

36:42.899 --> 36:45.444
but the Menk have the potential
to become the dominant species

36:45.611 --> 36:46.612
on this planet.

36:47.906 --> 36:51.869
And that won't happen as long
as the Valakians are around?

36:52.078 --> 36:54.081
If the Menk are to flourish,

36:54.247 --> 36:56.961
they need an opportunity
to survive on their own.

36:57.169 --> 36:59.213
Well, what are you suggesting?

37:00.590 --> 37:03.135
We choose...

37:03.344 --> 37:05.847
...one species over the other?

37:06.014 --> 37:09.895
All I'm saying is that we let nature
make the choice.

37:10.229 --> 37:11.731
The hell with nature.

37:11.898 --> 37:13.484
You're a doctor.

37:13.693 --> 37:16.697
You have a moral obligation
to help people who are suffering.

37:16.947 --> 37:18.157
I'm also a scientist.

37:18.408 --> 37:21.161
And I'm obligated to consider
the larger issues.

37:22.872 --> 37:25.125
Thirty-five thousand years ago,
your species coexisted

37:25.334 --> 37:27.587
with other humanoids.
Isn't that correct?

37:27.796 --> 37:28.797
Go ahead.

37:29.798 --> 37:31.926
What if an alien race had interfered

37:32.135 --> 37:36.308
and given the Neanderthals
an evolutionary advantage?

37:36.558 --> 37:38.311
Fortunately for you, they didn't.

37:39.061 --> 37:42.150
I appreciate your perspective
on all of this.

37:42.400 --> 37:45.029
But we're talking about something
that might happen.

37:45.195 --> 37:49.493
Might happen thousands
of years from now.

37:50.328 --> 37:52.581
They've asked for our help.

37:53.708 --> 37:57.504
I am not prepared to walk away
based on theory.

37:58.715 --> 38:00.342
Evolution is more than a theory.

38:00.593 --> 38:04.765
It is a fundamental scientific principle.
Forgive me for saying so,

38:04.973 --> 38:06.768
but I believe your compassion
for these people

38:06.976 --> 38:08.103
is affecting your judgement.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.440
My compassion
guides my judgement.

38:11.358 --> 38:13.986
- Captain...
- Can you find a cure?

38:17.116 --> 38:18.326
Doctor?

38:27.339 --> 38:28.925
I already have.

38:32.262 --> 38:35.642
Two days ago, when we
first discovered the alien shuttle,

38:35.851 --> 38:39.898
I had no idea that I'd be facing
a dilemma of this magnitude.

38:40.107 --> 38:44.363
For the first time, I find myself
in conflict with my captain.

38:44.613 --> 38:49.120
But he is my captain, and he's placed
a great deal of trust in me.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.790
I believe I owe him the same.

38:51.999 --> 38:53.459
I only hope that he's willing to look

38:53.668 --> 38:56.630
beyond his sympathy
for these poor people.

39:04.642 --> 39:05.768
Doctor.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.813
Captain.

39:09.566 --> 39:14.114
I'm going down
to the Valakian hospital.

39:14.322 --> 39:15.908
Sir...

39:17.201 --> 39:20.247
...it would go against all my principles
if I didn't ask you to reconsider...

39:20.497 --> 39:22.459
I have reconsidered.

39:23.252 --> 39:26.757
I spent the whole night reconsidering.

39:27.007 --> 39:30.137
And what I've decided
goes against all my principles.

39:34.769 --> 39:36.645
Someday...

39:37.314 --> 39:40.318
...my people are going to come up
with some sort of a doctrine.

39:40.568 --> 39:43.530
Something that tells us
what we can and can't do out here.

39:43.739 --> 39:46.451
Should and shouldn't do.

39:47.286 --> 39:52.960
But until somebody tells me
that they've drafted that directive...

39:54.254 --> 39:57.926
...I'm going to have to
remind myself every day...

39:59.053 --> 40:02.015
...that we didn't come out here
to play God.

40:04.143 --> 40:06.939
I'd like to think, Dr Lucas,
that if I'd had a chance

40:07.147 --> 40:08.900
to talk to you face-to-face,

40:09.109 --> 40:10.611
you'd have never let me
even consider

40:10.778 --> 40:13.323
withholding my findings
from the captain.

40:13.532 --> 40:17.830
But I'm ashamed to say
I almost did just that.

40:19.206 --> 40:23.295
Phlox tells me
this medicine will help...

40:23.504 --> 40:25.048
...ease the symptoms.

40:25.257 --> 40:28.469
For a decade, maybe more.

40:30.973 --> 40:33.393
A lot can happen in that time.

40:34.019 --> 40:37.607
I wouldn't be surprised
if you developed a cure on your own.

40:37.858 --> 40:39.819
And if we don't?

40:42.406 --> 40:46.787
With a warp-capable starship, our
chances would be greatly improved.

40:54.506 --> 40:56.384
I'm sorry.

41:01.224 --> 41:05.355
This will give you
detailed instructions on how...

41:05.606 --> 41:08.359
...to synthesize more of the medicine.

41:09.653 --> 41:12.157
We appreciate
everything you've done.

41:15.620 --> 41:18.373
If I hadn't trusted him
to make the right choice,

41:18.625 --> 41:20.753
I'd have been no better
than the Vulcan diplomats

41:20.961 --> 41:22.838
who held your species back

41:23.047 --> 41:27.053
because they felt you couldn't make
proper decisions on your own.

41:27.303 --> 41:31.309
I came very close
to misjudging Jonathan Archer.

41:32.394 --> 41:37.735
But this incident has helped me gain
a new respect for him.

41:38.861 --> 41:41.240
Happiness and health to you, doctor.

41:41.490 --> 41:44.995
Your dedicated colleague,

41:45.246 --> 41:46.748
Phlox.

41:51.755 --> 41:53.006
You wanted to see me.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.301
Please.

41:56.679 --> 41:58.974
For Dr Lucas.

41:59.141 --> 42:01.644
It'll go out first thing in the morning.

42:02.937 --> 42:05.190
Everything all right?

42:05.399 --> 42:07.444
Fine, fine.

42:09.905 --> 42:12.744
The past few days have been taxing.

42:13.995 --> 42:16.039
Want my advice?

42:16.707 --> 42:18.084
Get out of Sickbay.

42:20.045 --> 42:22.340
Yes. Perhaps you're right.

42:24.134 --> 42:25.762
Good night.

42:27.222 --> 42:28.766
Good night.

42:39.698 --> 42:42.035
Phlox to Crewman Cutler.

42:42.285 --> 42:43.996
Go ahead.

42:45.039 --> 42:47.501
I know it's short notice, but...

42:48.294 --> 42:50.588
...I was wondering if you might
like to join me for a little...

42:51.039 --> 42:53.259
...snack in the mess hall.

42:53.968 --> 42:56.722
I could use...

42:56.931 --> 42:59.059
...a friend right about now.

42:59.309 --> 43:00.937
Ten minutes?

43:01.145 --> 43:02.773
Thank you.

43:14.998 --> 43:16.083
Sweet dreams.
