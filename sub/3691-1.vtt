Chronicle of a Blood Merchant

01:04.879 --> 01:07.000
You don't look good today.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.000
Could you give me a watermelon to eat?

01:08.040 --> 01:09.420
Do not even think.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.160
Do you know how much watermelon costs?

01:11.260 --> 01:13.120
Why don't we share it?

01:13.260 --> 01:15.580
What type of person are you?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.960
She come here every morning
to harvest watermelon.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.000
Eat first before you continue.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.440
She has arrived.

01:25.140 --> 01:26.680
Welcome.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.440
Hello.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.140
This is sweet potato

01:33.260 --> 01:35.260
..and this is our family special vegetable.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.800
Guai Fa, are you really getting married soon?

01:37.960 --> 01:39.000
Marry, what marry?

01:39.760 --> 01:41.000
We broke off the engagement.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.580
Why so sudden?

01:42.860 --> 01:44.100
Of course there is a reason.

01:44.260 --> 01:45.280
Please don't joke about this.

01:45.460 --> 01:47.020
Please tell us more.

01:47.120 --> 01:50.460
I invited him to dinner at our house

01:50.620 --> 01:54.580
I am very happy if he can eat two bowls of rice

01:54.920 --> 01:56.220
If he can eat three bowls of rice

01:56.600 --> 01:59.900
Our Guai Fa could marry him straight away

02:00.040 --> 02:01.040
Unfortunately, he can only finish a bowl of rice

02:01.080 --> 02:03.440
and didn't want another bowl.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.480
Maybe he didn't have a good appetite.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.400
or probably your food wasn't delicious enough

02:07.400 --> 02:09.900
I found it strange, so we asked someone.

02:10.020 --> 02:14.760
We found out that this guy never went to town to sell any blood.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.760
This can explain the problem with him

02:16.760 --> 02:17.800
Certainly

02:17.800 --> 02:18.740
Mom let's go.

02:19.260 --> 02:20.200
There is no point telling the story

02:20.300 --> 02:21.180
Pitiful

02:21.300 --> 02:23.360
This guy is hopeless..

02:24.520 --> 02:26.140
Anyway, I got to go

02:26.600 --> 02:27.560
Well, take care

02:27.820 --> 02:31.520
Today, send these watermelon to the market to sell

02:31.520 --> 02:33.460
Okay, i will get it done right away

02:33.520 --> 02:34.000
Thanks for your effort

02:34.000 --> 02:34.520
We got to go now

02:34.760 --> 02:35.540
Let's go.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.700
Guai Fa is really a nice girl.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.780
She has grown very well.

02:44.500 --> 02:44.980
Uncle.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.320
Why cancel the engagement just because of the blood.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.360
Is it really so important?

02:48.520 --> 02:50.310
If it is Important, then it is important

02:50.320 --> 02:51.680
If it's not important, it is not really important.

02:51.800 --> 02:55.540
Any healthy person will go to town to sell some blood

02:57.060 --> 02:58.340
Whether a person is healthy or not,

02:58.420 --> 03:00.280
we can tell when they sell their blood.

03:01.420 --> 03:04.740
Grandpa said that there is compensation for selling blood

03:05.780 --> 03:07.060
Well, it is also a good health check

03:07.160 --> 03:11.080
to ensure the person is healthy

03:14.320 --> 03:16.240
Can I try?

03:16.380 --> 03:18.380
Here take it, share it out with others

03:18.460 --> 03:20.280
I want too, i want too

03:37.860 --> 03:39.320
Make way, make way

03:44.040 --> 03:46.040
Let's put it down

03:47.960 --> 03:49.820
Guys, it is rest time

03:49.820 --> 03:50.860
Let's continue after lunch

03:52.820 --> 03:53.720
Go eat

03:57.020 --> 04:00.520
Time to eat, come down

04:03.020 --> 04:05.260
It is tough to carry two piece of bricks

04:05.360 --> 04:06.380
Three piece actually

04:06.840 --> 04:09.320
I can see there are three piece... now time to rest.

04:09.520 --> 04:10.580
I know.

04:10.780 --> 04:11.840
Why are you working so hard?

04:12.680 --> 04:13.540
It's too hot

04:14.180 --> 04:15.680
I might not have the energy under the heat

04:15.960 --> 04:17.899
I think you have no where to release your energy.

04:18.019 --> 04:18.860
You need a woman

04:18.860 --> 04:21.060
It will be more tired if i have a woman

04:21.380 --> 04:24.260
Sam Gwan, check out the the girl over there

04:24.260 --> 04:25.460
<i>Barley drink for sale.</i>

04:26.440 --> 04:29.020
- Nice cool Barley drink
- she looks young in her twenties

04:29.240 --> 04:31.460
If she could gain some weight, it will be much better

04:31.460 --> 04:32.480
Will it be difficult to get her?

04:32.480 --> 04:34.080
depends who is courting her

04:34.080 --> 04:34.740
You better shut up.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.240
Don't be so choosy, you are lucky if you can have her

04:37.340 --> 04:38.260
I think she is cool.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.600
Do you want some barley drink?

04:40.600 --> 04:41.000
No, thanks.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.040
Do you want it?

04:43.040 --> 04:44.460
No, maybe next time

04:45.120 --> 04:46.160
She is trying to get our attention.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.980
Are you interested in her meat or the drinks she sells?

04:48.980 --> 04:49.460
Please buy popcorn.

04:49.460 --> 04:50.300
Please buy the popcorn.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.560

Hello.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.900

05:10.160 --> 05:11.960
It is delicious

05:13.740 --> 05:14.980
Please buy the popcorn.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.360
Yuk Fang is coming, pretty gal

05:20.680 --> 05:21.300

05:21.300 --> 05:22.360
Bring the popcorn over here..here

05:22.540 --> 05:25.720

05:25.880 --> 05:29.640
Pretty lady and the popcorn

05:29.840 --> 05:31.140
Popcorn popcorn.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.540
Look at those guys

05:37.760 --> 05:40.900
Thanks god, we are able to see her today

05:41.000 --> 05:42.040
Let's buy some from her

05:42.660 --> 05:45.100
Miss Yuk Fang, please....

05:45.480 --> 05:46.900
Miss Yuk Fang, you are really beautiful.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.740
Miss Yuk Fang, come here

05:51.100 --> 05:52.400
Thank you.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.300
Miss....don't leave

05:55.580 --> 05:58.980
Get up guys
I get up too

05:59.980 --> 06:03.420
We want it, we want popcorn.

06:03.820 --> 06:06.860
We want popcorn.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.260
It is good that you came here, Fuk Fang

06:08.680 --> 06:10.380
We haven't ate - Just waiting for you

06:10.560 --> 06:12.060
- Really?
- Yes really.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.020
Please take it my dear

06:15.240 --> 06:19.920
Popcorn is delicious with pretty seller.

06:21.840 --> 06:22.540
Yuk Fang

06:24.140 --> 06:25.840
I dreamed of you every night

06:31.840 --> 06:33.360
Want to try it?

06:37.700 --> 06:38.380
How much?

06:41.280 --> 06:42.360
Let you try it out first

06:44.840 --> 06:46.640
Why show the dirty hand in front of her?

06:47.720 --> 06:48.600
â‚©100

06:48.740 --> 06:49.680
What?

06:54.420 --> 06:56.400
Just eat it, on the house.

06:59.000 --> 06:59.980
Take care my lady

07:00.780 --> 07:02.780
She is really nice

07:04.380 --> 07:07.260
Sam Gwan, why are you so shy?

07:07.260 --> 07:09.360
What? Do i look shy?

07:09.360 --> 07:14.740
Everybody saw your face turning red and sweating.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.920
You saliva kept on drooling

07:21.920 --> 07:23.640
Anyway, what we can do now?

07:24.020 --> 07:26.300
She already has a boyfriend.

07:26.420 --> 07:28.080
That's her boyfriend over there

07:28.360 --> 07:29.360
You are here

07:30.860 --> 07:32.580
Look, you are sweating.

07:33.760 --> 07:34.260
Wipe it off.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.920
Over there. That guy wearing a white jacket.

07:37.140 --> 07:39.000
What is his background?

07:39.500 --> 07:40.900
Our hope has been destroyed

07:41.240 --> 07:45.520
She has become prettier ever since the relationship with that guy

07:45.700 --> 07:49.180
We heard that Yuk Fang has indebtedness to him

07:49.460 --> 07:52.080
The American guy has helped her a lot

07:52.340 --> 07:53.260
Because of benefits

07:53.260 --> 07:54.500
Of course there are benefits.

07:54.660 --> 07:58.100
Why every girl is attracted to rich guys like him?

07:58.100 --> 08:02.000
He has been fooling around with many women

08:02.200 --> 08:06.760
Yuk Fang's father said that she is ripe for marriage

08:06.960 --> 08:07.640
Really?

08:07.640 --> 08:08.280
Sam Gwan

08:08.760 --> 08:10.400
Your age are now overdue for marriage too.

08:10.840 --> 08:14.880
Today, I have noticed that the girl kept staring at him.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.880
I saw that too.

08:16.980 --> 08:19.680
That's correct, you also felt that she was staring at me?

08:20.060 --> 08:22.840
Correct, she kept on staring at you.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.840
Barley drink

08:24.700 --> 08:26.000
Sell barley drink

08:28.140 --> 08:29.040
Barley seller?

08:31.620 --> 08:33.240
I really don't care.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.000
How can you not bother?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.500
You don't even have a family,
should quickly find a woman to settle down

08:38.200 --> 08:40.100
Please buy popcorn.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.180
You are very strange today.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.180
Uncle, I want to get marry

08:53.160 --> 08:55.080
Well, then go ahead.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.340
But, do you have enough money for that?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.080
I don't have a lot of money now

09:00.500 --> 09:03.000
Uncle, you think  that i can earn a lot of money by selling blood?

09:05.860 --> 09:06.860
Who knows?

09:07.860 --> 09:10.100
I can't really earn much by working here

09:10.200 --> 09:13.000
Selling  blood can indeed earn much more than a farmer

09:13.100 --> 09:15.000
Why..... do you really want to sell blood?

09:15.400 --> 09:18.600
Yes, I would like to sell blood.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.280
Money first before marriage

09:21.060 --> 09:23.500
Yes, well you certainly have no problem selling blood.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.000
But, how and where can I sell blood?

09:28.160 --> 09:28.900
I don't know.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.400
Just go ask Fang Ji.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.560
You cannot sell blood just like that

09:35.780 --> 09:39.100
Many procedures to follow and those with poor health will be rejected.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.950
Thus, one must do body check up first

09:41.000 --> 09:44.800
Depends on whether you have enough good quality blood to sell

09:45.360 --> 09:46.760
How about me?

09:53.120 --> 09:54.400
Looks good, probably can sell a lot of blood

09:56.000 --> 09:57.940
How much money can i sell?

09:57.940 --> 09:59.360
â‚©1000 for each bottle.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.060
Almost same price as beef.

10:01.380 --> 10:03.320
That's about one month of my salary

10:03.800 --> 10:07.240
Need to do body check up before selling blood?

10:07.480 --> 10:09.020
- Yes
- The blood will be given to the hospital use.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.380
That blood will be sent to the hospital.

10:11.380 --> 10:12.340
I see

10:13.340 --> 10:14.780
What is inside your bag?

10:15.060 --> 10:15.460
Watermelon.

10:15.460 --> 10:16.500
Gonna to let go very soon

10:17.200 --> 10:18.880
As a gift to the doctor

10:18.920 --> 10:20.580
That person is responsible for the blood screening..

10:20.580 --> 10:22.880
..and to decide whether the person is successful or not

10:22.920 --> 10:27.320
Lawfully, one can only sell his blood once in every 3 months

10:27.360 --> 10:29.480
There is only one way to bypass the rules...

10:29.640 --> 10:33.360
... you have to give them benefits or gifts.

10:33.940 --> 10:36.000
That's how i can sell a lot of blood when compared to others

10:36.100 --> 10:38.300
This gift is a social gesture and importance

10:38.520 --> 10:41.720
Giving gifts will help you succeed in making money

10:41.840 --> 10:43.620
Guess, I will not stop selling blood until i am dead.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.920
He never refuses my blood

10:46.040 --> 10:48.800
The secret of our success in selling blood ..... is this watermelon.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.560
Min Loong, let's drink water

10:51.800 --> 10:53.220
Yeah, drink water.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.720
Why suddenly need to drink water?

11:00.320 --> 11:02.580
One must drink plenty of water before blood extraction.

11:02.580 --> 11:05.540
The body will be filled with full of water and blood

11:05.680 --> 11:06.960
In this way, we can sell more blood,

11:08.660 --> 11:09.140
I want to drink too.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.780
Good fresh water.

11:24.300 --> 11:28.200
Take clean water in the middle level
because top and bottom level, water is very dirty.

11:33.380 --> 11:34.680
How much should drink?

11:34.680 --> 11:35.820
About eight cups.

11:35.820 --> 11:36.720
Eight cups?

11:36.920 --> 11:38.660
Until your bladder is full

11:38.660 --> 11:40.660
Make sure you drink fast until you cannot take it

11:40.660 --> 11:42.660
Let's drink.

11:42.900 --> 11:43.540
Keep drinking.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.040
Bottoms up

11:51.040 --> 11:51.660
Continue drinking

11:52.100 --> 11:53.620
This process can't be stopped, keep drinking

12:01.160 --> 12:01.920
Continue to drink.

12:02.980 --> 12:05.820
Don't stop, don't stop

12:10.060 --> 12:10.900
It is here

12:15.620 --> 12:16.640
Let's go inside

12:17.060 --> 12:18.260
Come in

12:19.960 --> 12:21.380
Hey, what's wrong? Quickly come.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.540
Hey!! Hey!!

12:29.940 --> 12:30.660
What are you trying to do?

12:30.820 --> 12:31.560
Pee.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.280
Oh my god

12:33.780 --> 12:35.880
I am holding back hard too. Didn't you see my face turned red.

12:35.900 --> 12:36.280
Next step..

12:36.280 --> 12:38.900
...need to drink tap water

12:39.060 --> 12:39.440
Why?

12:40.020 --> 12:41.900
What is the taste of our blood?

12:42.600 --> 12:43.280
Fresh

12:43.560 --> 12:45.500
Blood must taste fresh

12:45.940 --> 12:47.240
I can't stand it now

12:48.540 --> 12:49.420
Hold back.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.100
I also feel uncomfortable.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.900
Didn't you see my face has turned white right now?

12:57.340 --> 12:58.100
Not really

12:58.540 --> 12:59.480
That's good.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.240
You need to hold back your pee.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.000
You can't give up at the final stage

13:03.200 --> 13:07.260
Let's drink more water, okay?

13:10.780 --> 13:11.260
Start.

13:19.960 --> 13:20.960
Come in

13:23.580 --> 13:26.220
Doctor, we have arrived.

13:27.060 --> 13:28.000
Doctor

13:29.680 --> 13:31.840
How much water have you drank this time?

13:33.700 --> 13:35.280
Just three cups

13:35.920 --> 13:39.320
You think I do not know that
you guys came here with full bladder capacity.

13:39.980 --> 13:42.220
At least 10 cups, right?

13:42.960 --> 13:44.060
Who is he?

13:44.260 --> 13:46.540
This is the first time i've seen him

13:46.920 --> 13:50.260
He is...our neighbor's brother from the village

13:50.660 --> 13:51.860
Today is his first time here.

13:52.960 --> 13:53.620
Hello.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.100
And..

13:57.100 --> 13:58.000
..this time as usual

14:00.060 --> 14:06.600
... this watermelon is fresh and just picked this morning.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.560
This one is from me.

14:12.520 --> 14:13.040
Send them to blood room.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.400
Please follow me.

14:14.740 --> 14:21.260
Doctor, how much blood are you gonna extract this time?

14:21.620 --> 14:23.540
Today is my father's birthday

14:23.760 --> 14:25.640
Should've told us earlier

14:26.580 --> 14:27.540
Two bottles is enough

14:28.540 --> 14:30.840
More than that could endanger your life

14:31.100 --> 14:32.640
Of course.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.040
In fact, the amount is more than normal

14:36.160 --> 14:38.000
But just because we are extremely healthy

14:38.220 --> 14:40.540
Doctor will allow us to sell more

14:40.680 --> 14:41.660
Am i right, doctor?

14:42.160 --> 14:43.440
We respect you very much, doctor

14:43.440 --> 14:44.500
Really respect you.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.700
Then, give them three bottles.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.980
Could you stop making that sound?

15:06.340 --> 15:12.000
Ming Loong, if you don't mind please check whether i had a pee accident

15:13.960 --> 15:15.000
Don't move, don't move

15:38.960 --> 15:40.560
So hungry and thirsty

15:41.960 --> 15:45.820
Blood sausage is very good for health

15:45.820 --> 15:49.180
and it is much better to take liquor with foods

15:52.560 --> 15:57.540
Thus, one must eat blood sausage immediately after the process

15:57.840 --> 15:59.220
Feeling like blood is replenished

15:59.540 --> 16:04.720
So amazing, like our body's back to original state.

16:04.820 --> 16:06.000
Yeah...yeah

16:09.820 --> 16:11.700
But I have a question uncle.

16:13.580 --> 16:16.800
How do you get a woman's heart?

16:17.980 --> 16:19.500
Is she pretty?

16:20.520 --> 16:22.380
Extremely beautiful

16:22.520 --> 16:24.600
And the problem is...?

16:25.520 --> 16:26.520
She has a boyfriend

16:27.280 --> 16:30.620
She already has a boyfriend and she looks really pretty, right?

16:30.620 --> 16:33.720
Pretty woman is really hard to handle

16:34.140 --> 16:39.340
Really? really?.....
The main point ain't that boyfriend

16:39.500 --> 16:40.820
Are you really serious and want to marry her?

16:41.560 --> 16:42.780
- Ah
- Sure?

16:43.080 --> 16:44.000
I've already told you clearly.

16:45.080 --> 16:48.120
In that case, you already got her.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.820
The most important thing is your heart and sincerity

16:50.540 --> 16:54.260
First, go directly to her house and tell her of your intention

16:54.520 --> 16:55.040
How to do this?

16:55.440 --> 16:59.640
Give everything that you have to her

16:59.800 --> 17:05.000
I have been single till now because i am not willing to do this

17:07.800 --> 17:08.420
Who are you?

17:11.000 --> 17:14.619
Hi, my name is San Xu Guan. Bing Chun is my friend

17:15.460 --> 17:16.260
You are Miss Yuk Fang, right?

17:16.859 --> 17:17.900
Yes I am

17:20.060 --> 17:22.119
Ah, I think i remember who you are

17:23.400 --> 17:24.339
What's up?

17:26.200 --> 17:27.280
This is actually a bit sudden

17:28.800 --> 17:31.860
Miss, i would like to invite you to eat buns.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.980
Are you willing to go eat buns with me now?

17:36.480 --> 17:37.060
Why?

17:38.700 --> 17:42.820
I still remember the last time you gave me some free popcorn

17:42.820 --> 17:45.460
Therefore, now you want to pay me back

17:45.460 --> 17:48.880
There is no free lunch in this world. Well, I can't be the exception.

17:49.960 --> 17:53.160
But I think your offer is not exciting

17:53.640 --> 17:56.500
Then, forget about the buns. Let's go for something that you like to eat.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.740
Change your clothes and come out now

17:59.060 --> 18:00.020
My belly is quite full now

18:01.660 --> 18:04.040
Ah.. now it's after dinner time. I should have come earlier

18:04.200 --> 18:06.640
Don't do that, that's my plants

18:06.760 --> 18:07.500
I'm sorry.

18:11.460 --> 18:14.040
How about tomorrow?

18:14.560 --> 18:16.000
Buy me buns tomorrow seems not a bad idea

18:16.560 --> 18:18.140
I feel like having buns tomorrow

18:35.980 --> 18:37.600
Yuk Fang, let me buy you this

18:37.840 --> 18:38.260
What?

18:46.280 --> 18:47.420
You are so kind

18:47.620 --> 18:49.140
It smells good

18:50.140 --> 18:51.240
Do you like pork?

18:54.140 --> 18:55.980
Get me a big piece one

18:56.220 --> 18:57.440
Half piece should be enough

18:57.780 --> 18:59.460
No cut, should be in one nice piece

19:01.000 --> 19:01.640
Cotton candy

19:02.060 --> 19:03.600
Yuk Fang, let's get some cotton candy

19:04.680 --> 19:05.880
Wow

19:11.880 --> 19:13.280
This must be very sweet.

19:17.380 --> 19:18.340
Eat slowly

19:19.620 --> 19:20.620
Yuk Fang!! ouchhhh!!

19:21.620 --> 19:22.740
That's so close

19:28.420 --> 19:31.200
That's oxcart. Do you like oxcart?

19:32.700 --> 19:33.980
Wow, bun.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.420
Give me a Naengmyeon (cold noodle)

19:38.060 --> 19:40.020
Wow..Naengmyeon (cold noodle)

19:42.560 --> 19:43.280
Beef barbecue

19:44.340 --> 19:46.140
Wow...beef barbecue.

20:06.060 --> 20:08.120
Wow.. so full

20:09.080 --> 20:11.500
Yuk Fang, let's try out the perfume

20:13.060 --> 20:14.120
I want to try it at home.

20:14.560 --> 20:18.680
No, let's see. Please try it now

20:29.800 --> 20:31.340
It smells not bad

20:31.900 --> 20:32.340
Yes.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.540
Yuk Fang, let's get down to business

20:39.780 --> 20:40.580
What?

20:40.780 --> 20:42.420
What you have eaten today..

20:43.200 --> 20:46.480
Naengmyeon (cold noodle) â‚©200....
Buns â‚©200....... â‚©400 for beef barbecue.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.500
That piece of pork and cotton candy.

20:49.060 --> 20:52.860
...perfume plus the coffee, all add up to a total of â‚©2000

20:54.680 --> 20:57.660
So, when are you going to marry me?

20:58.360 --> 20:59.040
What did you say?

20:59.660 --> 21:01.360
When will you marry me?

21:01.560 --> 21:02.560
Can't believe this

21:03.340 --> 21:05.580
Please give me some water.

21:05.580 --> 21:06.520
Yes

21:07.120 --> 21:08.580
I 'm asking...

21:08.980 --> 21:11.200
Why should I marry you?

21:11.900 --> 21:15.360
Because today I have spent more than â‚©2,000 on you

21:15.840 --> 21:17.600
Take back the perfumes and the pork

21:17.600 --> 21:20.320
No, no you keep.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.420
I'll pay you back the â‚©2,000

21:22.680 --> 21:27.800
you didn't tell me that after the meal i need to marry you.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.020
Here is it

21:32.660 --> 21:36.040
Yuk Fang, why don't you want to marry me?

21:36.240 --> 21:38.680
I'll buy you delicious food each day

21:38.980 --> 21:42.700
I wouldn't eat anything if i knew that i need to marry you

21:42.800 --> 21:44.920
Even if we are married,
the costs of eating will be beared by me

21:45.440 --> 21:46.540
How can i eat when I'm stressed?

21:46.880 --> 21:48.040
In order to avoid such thinking

21:48.340 --> 21:52.800
I will work hard in order to buy you delicious food everyday

21:53.540 --> 21:55.560
I can't marry you.

21:56.240 --> 21:59.180
I already have a boyfriend. He is He Xiao Yoong

22:06.180 --> 22:08.640
Naughty kids.... so noisy

22:08.920 --> 22:10.960
Hello uncle

22:13.200 --> 22:13.720
Who are you?

22:16.880 --> 22:18.860
Uncle, this is for you

22:21.600 --> 22:23.540
You bought pork?

22:23.880 --> 22:24.220
Yes.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.500
I am the best friend of the late Bing Zhong

22:26.780 --> 22:28.220
I am Xu Sanguan.

22:28.620 --> 22:31.900
In that case, I will accept this

22:31.900 --> 22:33.140
Yes, thank you uncle.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.760
I guess you knew my grandfather.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.400
He died early

22:37.760 --> 22:39.460
He was formerly a private school teacher in the village.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.040
My dad was a famous carpenter

22:42.940 --> 22:44.160
I knew that person

22:44.860 --> 22:46.000
He had great skills

22:46.580 --> 22:46.940
Yes.

22:48.980 --> 22:49.560
so?

22:50.100 --> 22:53.920
Then I inherited my dad's craft.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.220
While my parents died early.

22:56.620 --> 22:59.000
I've lived together with my grandpa and learn the true meaning of life

22:59.520 --> 23:00.100
And?

23:00.920 --> 23:06.840
But I heard that your daughter is going to marry He Xiao Yoong.

23:07.620 --> 23:08.140
That's right.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.300
If you don't stop the marriage, bad things will happen

23:11.460 --> 23:12.560
What did you say?

23:13.620 --> 23:15.880
He Xiao Yoong is capable and a healthy person

23:16.320 --> 23:18.680
He has some problem

23:19.000 --> 23:20.500
What are you trying to say?

23:21.120 --> 23:22.140
Bad news about him circulating in the village

23:22.420 --> 23:25.040
Ha So Yong had cheated many girls by promising marriage

23:25.260 --> 23:27.680
Flirting with many women and a notorious sex cheater

23:27.900 --> 23:30.900
..and Bing Zhong will not allow this marriage if he is still alive

23:30.900 --> 23:33.660
Do not ever mention Bing Zhong to me.

23:34.680 --> 23:35.360
I'm sorry, uncle

23:35.360 --> 23:38.000
I will not mention his name again

23:44.540 --> 23:48.480
Uncle, allow me to say something

23:48.920 --> 23:52.380
If you let your only child, Yuk Fang marry him

23:52.520 --> 23:55.280
Your "Zhong" family generation could be lost

23:55.360 --> 23:57.300
But if she is to marry me, the child will bear the same surname as me "Xu"

23:57.520 --> 23:59.220
A continuation and preservation of "Xu" line

23:59.320 --> 24:05.580
Besides, i will be your successor and able to continue
your popcorn business which you have worked for over 30 years

24:05.760 --> 24:09.180
In a nutshell, i could be your "son"

24:12.660 --> 24:13.500
Uncle

24:13.960 --> 24:17.080
This is all i have now, my life savings

24:18.100 --> 24:19.900
Please pass to Yuk Fang for safekeeping.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.300
If you are willing, I, Xu Sanguan

24:22.980 --> 24:27.580
will promise that to take care of you like my own father

24:28.220 --> 24:32.180
Why we never met since you were closed friend with Bing Zhong?

24:32.320 --> 24:37.860
Probably I have changed so much that you can't remember me.

24:38.460 --> 24:39.480
Hmm...that's possible.

24:41.120 --> 24:46.580
Nowadays, it is rare and difficult to meet an honest person like you

24:46.940 --> 24:48.920
Like father like son indeed.

24:51.660 --> 24:54.800
I can accept the alcohol and tobacco

24:56.080 --> 24:58.980
But take this back

24:59.200 --> 24:59.860
No uncle.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.840
Quickly keep it.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.100
Now, you look familiar

25:07.720 --> 25:08.540
Yuk Fang!

25:12.320 --> 25:16.140
Go inform He Xiaoyong that you are going to marry

25:16.500 --> 25:20.400
..and the groom is not him

25:21.180 --> 25:22.840
..but a guy sitting right here, Xu Sanguan

25:23.000 --> 25:23.740
Thank you uncle.

25:23.980 --> 25:24.720
Dad.

25:25.940 --> 25:28.720
Then, how about He Xiao Yoong?

25:29.500 --> 25:32.980
If he can't take it and hit his head against the wall

25:33.200 --> 25:34.800
What i'm going to do?

25:34.800 --> 25:35.740
What?

25:36.260 --> 25:37.780
If he is really dead cuz ..

25:37.780 --> 25:39.760
... hit his head against the wall

25:39.760 --> 25:41.540
then.. i really can' help it

25:46.100 --> 25:47.860
Do you really want to see me hit
my head against the wall?

25:48.620 --> 25:49.160
No.

25:50.680 --> 25:51.260
I knew it.

25:51.260 --> 25:53.000
Is it all because of money?

25:53.400 --> 25:56.020
Is it because of our marriage?

25:56.020 --> 25:59.780
He want our future child to have the surnamed "Xu"?

26:02.860 --> 26:04.740
That is ridiculous.

26:05.260 --> 26:09.560
If that's the case, I have to marry Xu Sanguan

26:09.560 --> 26:11.020
What?

26:36.940 --> 26:39.600
I am beautiful and talented

26:39.940 --> 26:41.300
..and you are such a lucky guy

26:41.300 --> 26:42.220
Of course.

26:42.220 --> 26:45.220
I will do the housekeeping except those heavy stuffs.

26:45.220 --> 26:48.220
..and rest during holidays

26:48.220 --> 26:49.960
Then, you will need to take care of all

26:49.960 --> 26:51.220
What holiday?

26:51.220 --> 26:55.000
Don't you know which holiday i celebrate?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.240
I have no idea.

26:56.660 --> 26:58.160
Menstruation.

26:58.460 --> 26:59.460
Opps.

27:04.460 --> 27:06.540
Good.

27:10.100 --> 27:11.580
Hey, i am going to take photograph now.

27:11.600 --> 27:16.980
Sam Gwan, why still so shy until your ears are red?

27:16.980 --> 27:18.980
Kiss, kiss

27:18.980 --> 27:20.980
How can they kiss in such day light?

27:20.980 --> 27:24.000
Too scattered, move closer.

27:24.360 --> 27:25.640
People at back row, move back a bit.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.000
What is this? Just snap it.

27:28.580 --> 27:31.000
Move back a little bit

27:31.500 --> 27:34.840
I won't come again for this shit!!

27:35.280 --> 27:37.880
What? What's the problem?

27:38.000 --> 27:41.280
Can't you adjust your camera?

27:41.980 --> 27:42.900
I think not the camera, it is the skill.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.500
Feel so frustrated .... this is shit.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.500
Who mention bad words on this special day?

27:48.360 --> 27:52.480
Look at the camera. One....Two...Three.

27:54.020 --> 27:59.620
<i>11 Years Later, 1964</i>

28:20.020 --> 28:21.520
First happiness.

28:21.900 --> 28:22.820
Yes.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.320
Please help mum get the broom

28:25.520 --> 28:28.020
No, I am helping Dad now.

28:28.520 --> 28:31.100
Second happiness, bring me the broom

28:31.700 --> 28:34.420
Mom, I'll get it for you.

28:34.700 --> 28:36.800
Third Happiness. No.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.000
Why?

28:39.620 --> 28:41.540
Hey, why don't you go outside.

28:42.000 --> 28:42.940
What is this?

28:42.940 --> 28:44.940
Mom, the broom.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.180
Thanks, good boy.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.680
Dad, could I help you with anything?

28:50.680 --> 28:54.020
No need, it is a big help if you just look and stand there.

28:54.040 --> 28:54.820
Really?

28:54.820 --> 28:56.120
Of course.

28:56.120 --> 28:59.980
Dad, are you tired? How about a glass of water?

28:59.980 --> 29:03.100
No, you go ahead,
just hold the ladder tight

29:03.100 --> 29:04.020
Okay.

29:05.020 --> 29:07.580
Go away. Don't need your help.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.000
No, I want to help too.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.400
Just go away.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.840
First Happiness, just let him help you.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
First happiness, pass this to your father.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.900
Dad, your gloves.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.060
I don't need it, you wear it.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.000
Give it to me.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.500
Second happiness, don't you think my skirt is nice?

29:28.620 --> 29:30.820
A gift from your father.

29:30.900 --> 29:34.120
Your fat aunt said i look horrible wearing this on my body.

29:34.120 --> 29:39.560
This skirt is best fit for you. Looks good on you, mum.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.740
That's my good son.

29:42.020 --> 29:45.420
Dad, I hate seeing Mum chatting with other women.

29:45.420 --> 29:47.960
Woman always gossip so much about who is beautiful..

29:48.060 --> 29:50.800
... nice cloths etc

29:50.800 --> 29:53.660
But for men, always about facts of life.

29:54.020 --> 29:57.620
Who has died, or who has money.... etc

29:59.520 --> 30:01.100
Third happiness, behave yourself.

30:01.100 --> 30:01.920
Don't want to.

30:01.920 --> 30:05.720
Third happiness, what are you doing?

30:05.720 --> 30:07.980
What if Dad falls off from here?

30:08.740 --> 30:09.540
Get your hands off.

30:15.740 --> 30:19.180
First happiness, what is wrong with this Third happiness?

30:19.740 --> 30:24.400
Your ear looks like me and Second happiness's teeth looks just like mom.

30:24.400 --> 30:28.060
How about Third happiness?

30:30.500 --> 30:33.720
When Sam Gwan's son laugh, he looks like He Xiao Yoong

30:33.720 --> 30:35.720
This guy just believe the rumor.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.720
Hey, what are you talking about?

30:37.780 --> 30:42.140
According to their neighbors, he is probably the son of Ha So Yong.

30:42.140 --> 30:47.820
Besides the eyes, the nose, mouth, ears and eyebrows
looks like Ha So Yong.

30:47.820 --> 30:51.200
Sam Gwan was able to marry Yuk Fang after he sold his blood.

30:51.340 --> 30:53.000
Probably, it happened before that.

30:53.140 --> 30:57.540
So, according to you guys, Sam Gwan has raised other people's child?

30:58.800 --> 31:05.240
Uncle, Yuk Fang had a relationship with
Ha So Yong many years ago.

31:05.300 --> 31:08.100
This is total ridiculous.

31:23.380 --> 31:25.880
Dad, this is your breakfast.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.040
That's my First happiness.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.000
Sit.

31:30.300 --> 31:35.960
Everybody is talking about what a filial face looks like.

31:35.960 --> 31:40.300
In my opionion, first happiness is filial

31:40.540 --> 31:41.680
That's right

31:41.860 --> 31:44.380
No need, I'll eat at home

31:44.380 --> 31:48.780
This is also filial

31:49.520 --> 31:53.020
Dad, can you give me this next time?

31:54.120 --> 31:55.600
Of course, let's see you wear it.

31:55.980 --> 31:56.760
ok

31:58.840 --> 32:00.960
Dad, when I came, I heard

32:01.440 --> 32:04.540
everybody say I look like Ha So Yong

32:08.380 --> 32:09.800
Who said?

32:09.800 --> 32:12.600
Alot of people are saying it.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.100
Today is not the first time I had heard it.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.220
Who is Ha So Yong?

32:19.080 --> 32:21.500
That one is Ha So Yong's home.

32:21.780 --> 32:25.240
A proud and petty man.

32:25.940 --> 32:28.640
that Ha So Yong

32:28.640 --> 32:30.860
Courted your mother before.

32:30.860 --> 32:33.760
but your mum ignored him

32:33.760 --> 32:36.400
Do you know what that meant?
- I do.

32:37.340 --> 32:40.240
Because she was in love with your dad.

32:41.580 --> 32:46.820
Your mum did not look at anyone else except your dad

32:46.980 --> 32:50.960
So one day, your mum suddenly wanted to get married.

32:50.960 --> 32:53.340
But your dad wasn't ready yet

32:53.700 --> 32:55.980
Your mum said she didn't want anything

32:56.040 --> 33:00.020
She cried and pleaded, saying she only wants
to live a married life with me.

33:00.380 --> 33:03.440
So that's how we got married.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.340
Why, the weather has changed.

33:06.660 --> 33:08.760
First happiness, you leave first.
- ok

33:11.960 --> 33:13.680
Hello, welcome

33:13.680 --> 33:15.480
First happiness, choose whatever you want to eat.

33:18.820 --> 33:20.020
This

33:20.500 --> 33:23.080
Good, first happiness.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.420
About the rumours,

33:25.420 --> 33:27.140
They are spread by those who are jeoleous

33:27.140 --> 33:30.660
of mum and dad. Think like that.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.100
Understand?
- Understand.

33:32.100 --> 33:33.980
Louder, understand?

33:33.980 --> 33:35.440
Please give me one.

33:38.740 --> 33:41.440
How much aunt?
Please wait.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.700
There's a letter.
Hello

33:45.700 --> 33:47.140
New?
yes.

33:47.140 --> 33:49.820
The letter did not get wet.
Thanks

33:49.820 --> 33:51.520
Thanks for your effort, please leave safely

33:51.800 --> 33:53.740
How much aunty?
-$10

33:57.900 --> 34:01.860
Give this directly to your dad.

34:01.860 --> 34:05.080
Weather like this can kill.

34:06.140 --> 34:08.000
Dad.
-Yeah?

34:10.139 --> 34:12.000
To Ha So Yong

34:14.060 --> 34:16.000
This crazy man

34:26.040 --> 34:27.420
Anything wrong?

34:27.420 --> 34:30.000
I came to get dad's blood report

34:30.239 --> 34:32.260
Everyone come.

34:32.260 --> 34:37.639
Let's confirm whether San is really first happiness's dad.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.500
Go, first happiness

34:39.500 --> 34:42.460
Dad will buy buns to eat.

34:44.199 --> 34:48.480
Yeah, go buy buns to eat. Good.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.060
Doesn't it just take one hour for the report?

34:57.460 --> 34:58.600
It's here

35:09.440 --> 35:11.640
Sorry for the wait

35:13.340 --> 35:15.360
We will find out soon

35:15.780 --> 35:19.640
first happiness, thanks for the effort, here.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.640
let's see

35:28.020 --> 35:31.860
That bastard, Ha So Yong's blood type is B, mine is O

35:31.860 --> 35:33.580
Yuk fang is A

35:33.580 --> 35:35.840
So my son is either A or O

35:35.840 --> 35:37.840
If it's B, then he is Ha So Yong's.

35:37.940 --> 35:41.300
I don't really understand because blood type is complex.

35:41.480 --> 35:45.400
But I want to clarify the issue

35:45.400 --> 35:48.220
so that the rumours can stop.

35:48.460 --> 35:50.180
Don't get confused.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.280
Listen, If there is B, then he's Ha So Yong's son.

35:52.980 --> 35:55.260
So it cannot be B.

36:03.320 --> 36:06.480
Blood report. Name: Xu first happiness.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.580
Blood type is

36:18.540 --> 36:21.000
What is it?

36:29.600 --> 36:32.080
First happiness's blood type is

36:32.460 --> 36:33.680
AB

36:35.380 --> 36:37.380
Not san's son.

36:37.980 --> 36:40.700
It's Ha So Yong real son.

36:49.820 --> 36:50.860
How can this be?

36:50.860 --> 36:52.360
What?

36:52.360 --> 36:53.660
First happiness's blood type

36:53.660 --> 36:55.960
Why does first happiness have Ha So Yong's blood?

36:56.660 --> 36:57.780
What are you talking about?

37:01.140 --> 37:04.140
I'm asking why does first happiness have Ha So Yong's blood?

37:04.980 --> 37:06.680
Why are you yelling?

37:06.680 --> 37:08.240
My ears are still very good.

37:08.540 --> 37:10.800
Ha So Yong's blood? What do you mean by that?

37:11.460 --> 37:13.420
So ridiculous!

37:13.440 --> 37:14.300
Where are you going?

37:14.300 --> 37:16.000
You had to make trouble about it.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.420
Answer me honestly

37:18.960 --> 37:22.500
What? Sticky beak? Nice to watch?

37:23.280 --> 37:26.100
What did I do wrong in my past life to live with a prick like you?

37:26.100 --> 37:28.080
You come here, get into the house.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.100
Explain in the house

37:31.100 --> 37:33.100
I did not remarry nor did I have an affair

37:33.720 --> 37:36.420
I have 3 children with the same man

37:37.000 --> 37:38.320
As if it's the truth.

37:43.320 --> 37:46.900
I have nothing to do with Ha So Yong

37:53.020 --> 37:55.120
I don't want to make this into a bigger problem

37:55.380 --> 37:57.800
let's be honest today, sit down

38:00.740 --> 38:01.720
Sit down

38:08.420 --> 38:09.780
Have you ever slept with Ha So Yong?

38:13.000 --> 38:15.220
Answer, did you sleep with him?

38:19.080 --> 38:20.100
yes

38:26.620 --> 38:27.620
How many times?

38:29.580 --> 38:30.780
Only once.

38:30.780 --> 38:33.740
So there is something going on

38:33.740 --> 38:35.420
and you said you never had an affair

38:36.020 --> 38:38.180
I did not have an affair

38:38.180 --> 38:41.040
Ha So Yong pinned me to the wall

38:41.980 --> 38:44.700
then dragged me onto the bed.
- Ok enough.

38:48.380 --> 38:50.180
You couldn't push him away?

38:50.180 --> 38:52.200
You couldn't bite him or kicked him?

38:52.200 --> 38:54.760
I pushed and I kicked.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.760
But after he pushed me against the wall,

38:57.320 --> 39:00.340
He had both hands on my breast.
-  ah ah argh

39:03.440 --> 39:05.020
That bastard.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.080
So that dog bastard touched your breast.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.200
What happened next? Fell asleep? Quickly answer.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.400
No need to say anymore

39:15.400 --> 39:16.480
Say it.

39:16.880 --> 39:19.260
What happened after that bastard touched your breast?

39:19.260 --> 39:21.260
After he touched my breast,

39:21.900 --> 39:24.080
my strength slowly drained away

39:24.980 --> 39:28.160
so you quietly slept with him?

39:28.980 --> 39:30.880
Because I had no more fighting strength.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.980
he then dragged me onto the bed.

39:33.380 --> 39:34.980
grabbed my arms

39:34.980 --> 39:37.600
came down to my ears,
- Stop!

39:42.660 --> 39:44.820
That bastard

39:48.900 --> 39:51.320
So that was the root of first happiness's disaster.

39:51.320 --> 39:53.880
I remember

39:53.900 --> 39:55.320
on our wedding night

39:55.320 --> 39:58.040
you put out the light I lit

39:58.040 --> 39:59.800
coz it wasn't your first time and you didn't want me to know

39:59.800 --> 40:01.420
it's not like that

40:01.420 --> 40:03.900
It was because I was shy

40:03.900 --> 40:05.900
be careful of what you say

40:06.680 --> 40:08.580
11 years already, 11 years

40:08.580 --> 40:11.700
I raised some bastard's son for 11 years without knowing it.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.520
Kids

40:43.520 --> 40:45.580
Is your father Ha So Yong?

40:46.200 --> 40:48.420
Are we from the same mother but different father?

40:48.420 --> 40:50.420
What are you talking about? I don't know

40:52.000 --> 40:54.400
Dad

41:00.600 --> 41:02.200
Who are you?

41:03.640 --> 41:05.420
Hello, dad.

41:05.420 --> 41:07.580
What's is this about?

41:10.020 --> 41:14.000
That kid is the rumoured child.

41:14.780 --> 41:17.400
so why are you here? What do you want to say?

41:17.400 --> 41:18.600
What do you want to say?

41:18.600 --> 41:20.180
How are you?

41:20.180 --> 41:21.240
Not one bit fine.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.580
Ok, I know

41:22.580 --> 41:24.160
Isn't my dad here?

41:24.160 --> 41:26.300
No, he's not here,  where is your father?

41:26.300 --> 41:27.680
Go,

41:27.680 --> 41:29.680
Wait, don't panic.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.460
I will leave.

41:31.460 --> 41:33.980
I just want to say "dad" three times.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.420
Dad, Dad, Dad

41:40.800 --> 41:42.140
What? This kid.

41:54.520 --> 41:57.200
Honey,  Can you help me carry this urn?

41:57.440 --> 41:58.360
I'm sleeping.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.540
Mum, I'll do it

42:05.500 --> 42:08.140
Honey, can you help me with this quilt?

42:08.140 --> 42:09.620
It's too big.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.620
Just rest on it.

42:11.620 --> 42:14.820
I was planning to go to sleep, How can I help?

42:16.300 --> 42:18.020
Mum, I'll do it

42:31.960 --> 42:33.740
Dad, what's wrong?

42:33.760 --> 42:35.020
Go away

42:36.440 --> 42:39.060
Mum, Dad's crying.

42:59.380 --> 43:01.500
In the middle,

43:01.500 --> 43:03.740
hey, third happiness, it hit me.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.160
So?

43:08.600 --> 43:11.620
you come over, ay ya,
-stop,
-don't hit

43:17.040 --> 43:20.300
I will tell my brothers to come, I have two big brothers.

43:20.580 --> 43:23.080
You're dead meat if my big brother's here.

43:23.080 --> 43:24.500
You think only you have brothers?

43:24.500 --> 43:26.020
I have two big brothers too.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.160
You're the dead meat when my brother comes.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.660
Brother

43:36.300 --> 43:37.700
Brother

43:39.320 --> 43:42.140
Brother, Brother

43:42.120 --> 43:44.380
What is it? so noisy.

43:44.380 --> 43:46.620
I had a fight with someone

43:47.020 --> 43:49.420
Quickly come help me.

43:49.420 --> 43:51.420
Who did you fight with?

43:51.420 --> 43:54.420
I don't know that guy,

43:55.040 --> 43:56.880
How did the fight go?

43:56.880 --> 43:58.360
I got hit.

43:58.560 --> 44:00.680
If brother goes, I will win.

44:02.020 --> 44:04.320
Ok, let's go.

44:04.380 --> 44:06.000
lead the way

44:12.580 --> 44:15.240
So you had a fight with my brother?

44:15.300 --> 44:18.020
I did not fight with your brother.

44:18.020 --> 44:21.300
It's my little brother who had the fight with your brother.

44:23.440 --> 44:26.500
I'll treat it as if it's you who hit my brother.

44:27.360 --> 44:28.340
Come here.

44:29.220 --> 44:30.100
Wait

44:30.700 --> 44:32.580
Let's talk

44:33.640 --> 44:35.620
It was your brother who started first.

44:35.760 --> 44:36.880
Then it was returned.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.760
Big brother, first happiness.

44:45.180 --> 44:48.580
Xu yi lok (first happiness)

44:49.400 --> 44:52.120
Stupid

44:52.120 --> 44:54.160
Like this?

44:57.000 --> 44:58.300
Yes

45:06.420 --> 45:08.520
You made me wait a long time, first happiness.

45:18.980 --> 45:22.100
If you dare touch my brothers again,

45:22.780 --> 45:24.880
I will not let you off so easily.

45:26.460 --> 45:27.780
Let's go home.

45:28.340 --> 45:29.920
Brother, are you okay?

45:35.000 --> 45:38.160
The kids were fighting and it

45:38.160 --> 45:40.280
caused a bit too much problem

45:41.340 --> 45:42.820
Althought I had 11 years of friendship

45:42.820 --> 45:45.500
with the boy's father

45:45.500 --> 45:46.920
I couldn't resolve it.

45:46.920 --> 45:50.500
If there is no money, just go and sell blood again.

45:52.500 --> 45:53.660
The cost is too much.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.280
Including medical expenses,

45:56.280 --> 45:57.620
it comes to $5000

46:00.140 --> 46:03.640
Really, this is really painful. Interesting.

46:05.220 --> 46:06.540
But big brother,

46:07.120 --> 46:09.040
I don't have anything to do with the problem

46:09.960 --> 46:11.400
Althought I'm resentful, you know

46:11.660 --> 46:13.200
I only have two sons

46:13.620 --> 46:15.340
Go ask Ha So Yong's help.

46:15.980 --> 46:21.160
First happiness's father needs to take responsibility?

46:21.260 --> 46:25.220
part responsibility or all of the responsibility?

46:25.800 --> 46:27.240
Of course all.

46:27.960 --> 46:29.120
Let's reason

46:29.120 --> 46:32.000
I've been a fool for 11 years

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
raising his son,

46:34.500 --> 46:37.760
and still I have to pay for medical expenses on his behalf?

46:39.700 --> 46:42.240
Am I some king?

46:46.380 --> 46:48.620
Come and have a look at the family registry.

46:48.960 --> 46:51.120
Is first happiness's surname there?

46:52.220 --> 46:55.820
Xu is not my family name.

46:55.820 --> 46:57.700
That uncle should fork out the medical expenses.

46:59.620 --> 47:01.040
ok?

47:01.540 --> 47:03.340
Please go home.

47:14.580 --> 47:15.680
San

47:17.740 --> 47:19.140
Hello everybody.

47:21.400 --> 47:22.280
This

47:23.080 --> 47:24.480
Sorry

47:25.820 --> 47:28.640
This is not going to work, please understand.

47:28.980 --> 47:30.980
Understand, please go.

47:30.980 --> 47:32.640
Please go.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.940
Except my things,

47:40.940 --> 47:42.820
you can take anything that is convienent.

47:42.820 --> 47:45.180
Right, fan, take it.

47:45.300 --> 47:46.640
Good, really good.

47:47.100 --> 47:49.300
Brother, that is not Yok fang's, it's mine.

47:49.300 --> 47:51.100
Really, take it away

47:51.100 --> 47:52.200
I say

47:52.200 --> 47:53.680
all this things

47:53.680 --> 47:55.440
I will help you sell them.

47:55.440 --> 47:57.440
until there is enough money

47:57.440 --> 47:58.800
to pay for the medical expense.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.800
I Will return the rest to you.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.800
Go ahead, go ahead.

48:03.980 --> 48:06.000
That won't do, please put it down.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.200
Move, brat, out of the way.

48:09.160 --> 48:11.500
Dad, mum's stuff been taken.

48:11.500 --> 48:12.800
Tell them not to.

48:12.800 --> 48:14.800
This little bastard

48:14.800 --> 48:16.620
where is your dad?

48:17.980 --> 48:21.060
You asshole, why are you abusing first happiness?

48:21.060 --> 48:22.700
Bastard?

48:23.280 --> 48:25.840
Are you still human?

49:17.820 --> 49:19.360
Ha So Yong.

49:21.820 --> 49:23.020
Ha So Yong

49:25.940 --> 49:27.080
What's happening?

49:31.480 --> 49:33.340
Long time no see,  Ha So Yong

49:34.780 --> 49:36.480
Have your style changed for the better?

49:36.480 --> 49:37.920
What do you want?

49:37.920 --> 49:40.940
It was hard for my husband to raise your son

49:40.940 --> 49:42.040
I've come to talk about this.

49:42.040 --> 49:43.160
What are you talking about?

49:43.160 --> 49:44.840
Don't understand a word.

49:44.840 --> 49:49.040
My husband raised your son for 11 years, you don't have to
compensate for food and clothes.

49:50.240 --> 49:52.980
But you have to pay for the medical expenses.

49:53.220 --> 49:55.100
What has that got to do with me?

49:55.100 --> 49:57.720
Your son smashed the other kid's head.

50:00.840 --> 50:04.360
I have no son, only two daughters. He mei zi and He sui zi.

50:05.560 --> 50:07.900
Is that so?

50:11.280 --> 50:12.700
You cheating bastard

50:13.300 --> 50:14.700
don't you remember that summer?

50:14.700 --> 50:19.420
You raped me when my dad went to the toilet. Cheater.

50:19.480 --> 50:20.520
You shut up.

50:20.840 --> 50:22.140
Why are you mentioning the past?

50:23.220 --> 50:27.380
Why have you come to see me after doing what you did?

50:28.300 --> 50:30.800
Go and take a look at first happiness's face.

50:31.420 --> 50:33.420
His eyebrows are exactly like yours.

50:33.420 --> 50:35.720
Go pay the money.

50:36.160 --> 50:37.200
Really

50:38.520 --> 50:40.300
Dad!
- what money?

50:41.400 --> 50:43.140
mei zi, sui zi

50:45.280 --> 50:48.240
When all dressed up,

50:49.520 --> 50:52.300
Her features are not bad but how come she looks like a fox vixen?

50:52.820 --> 50:54.100
Fox vixen.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.260
I can seduce any other husbands, but certainly not yours.

50:58.660 --> 51:00.020
Maybe you don't know.

51:00.020 --> 51:02.140
I dumped your husband.

51:02.460 --> 51:05.500
After I dumped him, you worked hard to chase him.

51:05.920 --> 51:09.060
Oh my god. Why is there such a shameless woman?

51:09.680 --> 51:12.880
Was it tiring giving birth to someone else's son?

51:12.880 --> 51:14.880
Of course it's tiring after 3 children.

51:15.120 --> 51:18.300
So it's not tiring if it is not three sons?

51:18.300 --> 51:20.560
Are both of those girls yours?

51:20.720 --> 51:22.560
What are you implying?

51:24.780 --> 51:27.660
Only ignorant women like you can be tricked by men.

51:27.660 --> 51:31.420
Really? So you think you are not ignorant?

51:32.860 --> 51:35.620
Looks like wu jingyu's smell hasn't dissapated from this house.

51:35.620 --> 51:36.560
Wu jingyu (implying a mistress)

51:37.920 --> 51:41.060
Who is wu jingyu?

51:50.340 --> 51:52.040
hey hey hey, move over.

51:52.820 --> 51:54.000
Oh no! big problem

51:54.000 --> 51:56.140
Your wife and Ha So Yong's wife.

51:56.560 --> 51:59.520
are fighting in Ha So Yong's house.

51:59.620 --> 52:01.080
Quickly go and persuade them.

52:01.740 --> 52:04.900
The neighbours cannot separate them.

52:04.900 --> 52:07.200
ah ya, quickly go pull them apart.

52:07.700 --> 52:08.960
Anything else?

52:09.360 --> 52:10.180
Only this

52:10.780 --> 52:12.800
Your wife didn't seem to have got the money

52:14.040 --> 52:14.840
That's no good.

52:14.840 --> 52:16.880
She wants to fight, what can I do?

52:17.140 --> 52:19.140
Why don't you just eat with me?

52:19.140 --> 52:19.440
huh?

52:20.840 --> 52:21.440
Like this?

52:22.700 --> 52:23.440
Good.

52:23.880 --> 52:24.380
huh

52:26.040 --> 52:26.900
Ah ya

52:27.360 --> 52:28.940
What's with the fist?

52:29.360 --> 52:30.940
You want to fight?

52:30.940 --> 52:32.000
Quickly go home.

52:35.360 --> 52:37.260
Really, don't be a laughing stock in front of the neighbours.

52:37.500 --> 52:38.080
ah ya

52:38.540 --> 52:39.280
Look, bleeding.

52:40.160 --> 52:40.780
Quickly leave

52:40.780 --> 52:42.780
Go, mei zi, sui zi, leave.

53:10.260 --> 53:12.680
Aigoo, I knew you would come back empty handed.

53:15.300 --> 53:18.140
Your wife has lost face for the family.

53:19.180 --> 53:23.880
mao mi ah, wait, mao mi, come

53:26.180 --> 53:27.620
Ha So Yong said I am mad.

53:33.140 --> 53:35.740
Go and kill that bastard

53:35.740 --> 53:38.340
I will go to jail if i kill him.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.880
Then you will become a widow.

53:42.240 --> 53:43.940
That miser.

53:45.800 --> 53:47.240
He's only all talk.

53:47.920 --> 53:51.540
mao mi has a mouth too. mao mi.

53:51.540 --> 53:52.400
ah ya

54:02.340 --> 54:03.460
ah ya

54:07.900 --> 54:08.660
Ah

54:10.420 --> 54:11.160
My son

54:11.840 --> 54:12.660
I have only you two left.

54:13.280 --> 54:14.740
So I want to ask you,

54:16.060 --> 54:17.860
who made our family like this?

54:18.780 --> 54:21.080
sum uncle,
-Sum uncle

54:21.080 --> 54:24.080
No, not sum uncle.

54:24.460 --> 54:26.960
It's the son of a bitch, Ha So Yong.

54:27.840 --> 54:30.080
Ha So Yong, that bastard insulted your dad.

54:30.080 --> 54:32.080
Made your mum pregnant with first happiness behind my back.

54:32.640 --> 54:34.220
That lead to the breakdown of our family

54:35.400 --> 54:36.400
Haa

54:38.040 --> 54:38.420
You two,

54:39.680 --> 54:41.340
do you know Ha So Yong has two daughter?

54:41.820 --> 54:42.900
-Yes
- yes

54:43.940 --> 54:44.820
When you two grow up

54:45.800 --> 54:46.700
get those two girls

54:48.940 --> 54:49.640
pregnant.

54:51.820 --> 54:52.440
Understand?

54:53.020 --> 54:54.440
-Get them pregnant
-Get them pregnant

54:56.540 --> 54:57.680
Bring that home.

55:20.000 --> 55:20.860
Hello

55:23.920 --> 55:27.920
Few years ago, it was bustling outside the hospital.

55:28.640 --> 55:30.820
It seems recently, no one is selling blood.

55:31.240 --> 55:33.220
Datin hospital pay double the price.

55:33.800 --> 55:34.940
Every body went there to sell blood.

55:35.260 --> 55:35.920
mmm

55:37.180 --> 55:39.800
But, how come you are here?

55:39.840 --> 55:42.820
Ha, right. It's already been 10 years.

55:43.140 --> 55:45.560
I used to come with fong and gun.

55:45.560 --> 55:46.640

55:53.880 --> 55:56.120
This time they came with white sugar.

55:56.120 --> 55:58.580
You know what I mean. ha ha

55:58.580 --> 55:59.560

Wait, your name is Xu san?

56:14.540 --> 56:17.060
Xu san

56:17.280 --> 56:21.320
If you remember. I'm the one who used to give watermelon.

56:21.320 --> 56:23.180
ah, you're the one who worked on the contruction site,

56:23.400 --> 56:25.960
The one who raised someone else's son.

Yes, that's right, ha ha ha, I know.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.600
But what happened to your legs?

57:05.660 --> 57:07.060
It's wooden

57:07.680 --> 57:09.020
I fell into a pit

57:09.720 --> 57:10.280
Aigoo

57:10.840 --> 57:11.980
A sewage pit?

57:13.840 --> 57:15.080

57:15.740 --> 57:17.280
No, it's not

57:19.500 --> 57:20.140
That's good.

57:20.940 --> 57:21.560
Your wife,

57:22.020 --> 57:23.340
I often see her in the market

57:24.120 --> 57:26.820
She already has three kids

57:26.980 --> 57:28.560
Not only is she pretty but

57:29.160 --> 57:30.380
her figure is as when she was young.

57:30.500 --> 57:33.180
Every body says she is smart and nimble

57:34.080 --> 57:35.880
Talking about beautiful, you are more beautiful than her.

57:37.460 --> 57:37.960
Huhh?

57:38.240 --> 57:39.060
In truth

57:39.400 --> 57:41.020
I originally wanted to marry you

57:42.080 --> 57:45.260
If I did, then I wouldn't have been a fool for 11 years.

57:45.600 --> 57:46.620
What fool?

57:47.140 --> 57:48.320

58:14.920 --> 58:17.980
You are so quiet, your home has a sense of peace,

58:18.480 --> 58:22.720
You're much better than my wife who screams and creats trouble
in front of the neighbours.

58:23.180 --> 58:24.980
she should be gentle like you.

58:25.400 --> 58:27.060
Come and sit for a while before you go.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.560
What should I get for you?

58:29.740 --> 58:31.480
No need, No need.

58:32.120 --> 58:34.600
Oh, I should have bought that rice roll

58:35.160 --> 58:36.340
No, I should be buying it.

58:36.840 --> 58:38.020
I almost ate it all.

58:38.760 --> 58:40.660
Don't stand, come sit here.

58:41.460 --> 58:42.660
Go away

58:43.980 --> 58:45.480
I told you not to be like this

58:49.600 --> 58:51.580
Oh, it tai man

58:52.980 --> 58:54.460
I'll draw for you

58:54.460 --> 58:55.520
Don't move.

58:59.060 --> 58:59.740
Oh, you brat.

59:01.840 --> 59:02.680
What are you doing here?

59:03.600 --> 59:04.740
Waiting for you, dad.

59:05.020 --> 59:06.200
How did you know I was here?

59:07.080 --> 59:08.900
I followed you the whole day

59:10.780 --> 59:11.440
Dad

59:12.220 --> 59:13.600
Can you forgive me?

59:15.540 --> 59:17.600
What's there to forgive?

59:21.180 --> 59:21.820
First happiness

59:22.500 --> 59:22.800
Yes

59:26.040 --> 59:28.420
From now on, whenever we are together alone,

59:29.280 --> 59:31.260
Don't call me dad, call me uncle.

59:31.740 --> 59:31.980
What?

59:33.220 --> 59:33.640
Why?

59:34.260 --> 59:36.000
This way, we can live together.

59:36.780 --> 59:37.020
huh?

59:38.560 --> 59:38.900
Yes

59:39.600 --> 59:40.000
But

59:40.740 --> 59:44.220
You can call me dad in front of mum and the neighbours.

59:45.220 --> 59:46.840
Then you can forgive me?

59:47.800 --> 59:49.440
You have to first listen to uncle.

59:51.540 --> 59:52.880
You, if you had solved this earlier,

59:53.260 --> 59:56.240
then we wouldn't have to move these here and there

59:56.740 --> 59:58.900
You have a solution only when cornered.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.480
People just find a way only when cornered

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:03.980
Hey, hold tight

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:04.880
Yes, uncle.

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:15.620
Ah

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.760
Haa

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.060
What is this?

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:30.720
Try it

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.160
I'm asking, what's going on?

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.080
Of course, I used money to exchange it.

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:35.400
Where did you get the money?

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.060
Don't nag, just wear this.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.900
Quick, let see how you look

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:41.340
Be happy

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:42.300
Wear it

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.380
If you had done this a long time ago,

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.280
then it wouldn't have been taken away

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.660
Hey, come on, let's see how you look.

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.900
Xu san, you bastard!

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.360
Cannot believe you are this type of person!

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:57.940
This brat!

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.940
You have the nerve to rape my wife?!

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:01.120
What?

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.680
What are you talking about?

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.360
Hey, big brother

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.440
What did you just say?

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.340
How dare you ask what I'm talking about!

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.180
What are you talking about?

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.520
Rape?

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.520
When I returned home,

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:17.160
my wife pushed me away and was in a cold sweat.

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:18.220
Then, those..

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.460
Then I saw those.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.000
Have you thought about my feelings?

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.240
So I grabbed her hand and interogated her for a long time.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.380
You even had to rape a woman with broken leg.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.980
You, less than an animal, bastard.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.860
She said she slept with you.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.020
That... Wait

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.200
Hubby, is that true?

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.200
No, does this make sense?

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.040
Everybody saw it, saw it!

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.660
Every body saw you and my wife enter the house.

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:45.420
and

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:46.560
this

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.740
This is canned food

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.100
huh, what's the matter?

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.980
You bastard, want to deny?

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.700
You slept with that woman?

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:57.260
You think that makes sense? Really!

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.000
Big brother, I think you had too much to drink, Aigoo.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.000
No

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.860
I saw her limping, I just wanted to see her home.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.300
ha, She said her leg hurt, so I just kneed it .

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.140
-But
- Wait

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:09.920
Kneed her leg?

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.580
Hey Xu san

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.820
Where did you kneed?

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.820
-Where did you say?
 -Her leg.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.640
He said leg.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.560
So you used massage as an excuse.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.840
How could my wife run away from you

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.280
when she has a broken leg?

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.280
To close her mouth,

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.740
you went to sell blood

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.840
This! This!

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.820
Are you human?

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.060
I trusted you

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.520
Big brother, please calm down.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.520
-This is really a misunderstanding.
- Wait a moment

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.360
My father, he

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.620
helped aunty to her bed and then left immediately

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.640
Hey,  don't cut into adult's conversation!

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:48.760
I saw it too.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.220
What do you know!?

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:53.680
I was with dad at the time.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:55.920
I was at your front door.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.640
xi bo uncle and sum uncle saw it too.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.240
I had always followed my dad

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.460
What is this?

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.240
What is happening?

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.220
Hey you are just favouring your dad.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.800
Uncle, don't you know?

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.280
He's not my real dad.

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.160
Big brother.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.160
Our first happiness said he saw it all.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.580
Do you have to make the situation so awkward?

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.020
And uncle

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:23.100
You seem drunk.

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.100
You smell like alcohol.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.420
Quickly go home and sleep.

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.440
No more show, go go go.

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.540
Huh, my wife ate the wrong medicine and talked nonsense.

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:35.040
Who knows where she came up with these ideas.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.160
What's this, take your canned food with you.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.620
This brat.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.700

-ah
-Dad, I'm hungry too.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:12.900
Children.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.320
Do you know why you are hungry everyday?

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.320
Everyday you go out

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.220
run, jump and play noisily,

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:24.160

When the sun comes out tomorrow morning,

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.100
don't jump out of bed

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.540
just stay in bed

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.840
just lay there, understand?

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:33.460

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.180
cook for you to eat.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:52.980

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:54.440

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:55.540
Starting from third happiness.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:57.740
I want to eat an extremely big meat bun.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.140
Extremely big meat bun.

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.540
Ok, we will make an extremely big meat bun.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:03.520
so first,

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.600
because it's a meat bun, we have to put in meat

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.840
Put in a big piece of meat.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.500
Put the lean and fat meat together, then,

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:15.680
mix the meat with pepper, onion and vermicelli

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.780
Then use this mixture to make 5 big buns.

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.900
Dad, I want 6.

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:22.200
No

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.640
Your little stomach can only fit 5.

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:25.240
Understand?

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.380
Don't answer back

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.300
Good. Then ..

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.080
lay a cotton cloth into the steamer.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:31.520
steam 10 minutes in low heat.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.620
Start steaming.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:34.700
Wah

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.340
How is it? Meat smells good huh?

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.180
Ok, done.

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.640
Third happiness extremely big meat bun is completed.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.460
Come, instead of swallowing saliva, swallow the bun, ok?

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:56.280
Who is it? What is happening? What noise is that? ha?

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.400
This is third happiness's bun.

01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.840
If other are salivating

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.140
It's like looting his bun's, understand?

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.220
Wait patiently.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.740
Ok, now, it's second happiness's turn.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.240

We forgot to put tofu into third happiness's bun.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.880

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:15.980
Steam carp, you're really weird.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.640
That requires a bit of work, how are you going to do it?

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.080

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:20.800

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.560
then fresh ginger.

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:31.340

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.600

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.080
Me?

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:03.360
Where's fong uncle?

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.420
I don't know, brother.

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:06.000
I've got to go back.

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:06.660
No

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:12.600
Oh

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:17.560
Xu san the fool.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.479
I came empty handed, sorry.

01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:20.840
Rely on you.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.080
Ha ha ha ok

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.859
But, leave a can of canned food here.

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:41.080

Here

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.060

01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:57.920
Let's go

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.600
Don't sell blood again.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.720
Then what can we do?

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.020
You and the kids are hungry.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.760
Even so, don't sell blood anymore.

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:11.420
ha, they took three bottles of blood and I nearly blacked out.

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.700
It's because I didn't eat pig's sausages.

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:13.520
What?

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.200
One less canned food.

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:16.939
That went to the doctor

01:09:18.819 --> 01:09:22.120
I told you I have to give it to the doctor

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:25.920
Quickly get up, you guys,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:26.760
still not getting up?

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:28.760
Go eat the buns kids.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.319
-Ahhh buns
-Buns

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.939

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.319
Honey, dress them up.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:38.840
Buns, Buns today, we can eat buns

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.140

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:41.819

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:57.740
Let's talk

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:08.380
First happiness.

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.060
Today, you are going to grandpa's house to eat.

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:11.440
What?

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.960
Grandpa is cooking

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:14.740
Go to grandpa's house to eat.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.540
Uncle

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.640
Only today,

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.840
can't you treat me like your real son?

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.320
Take me to the market to buy buns.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:24.400
please?

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:28.380
First happiness, do you know what this is?

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:30.520
Scars from selling blood

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.980
Why do I have to sell blood?

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.020
So that I can feed my family, but

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:39.100
I cannot buy buns for you to eat, why?

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.400
To give you buns

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:43.520
is like giving my blood to Ha So Yong. Right?

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:44.560
Right

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.300
Not wrong right?

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:45.960
No

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.540
Now that you understand, go.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.980
Don't let your mum know.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:53.440
Uncle

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.900
Softer, shhhh

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:55.640
Quieter.

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:57.140
Now what, kid

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:58.360
What?

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.540
If I was your real son,

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.320
you would take me out to buy buns right?

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.220
If you were my son,

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.680
the one I love the most would be you.

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.440
Go

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.620
We are ready

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.180
Where are you going, first happiness?

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:24.740
Mum

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.360
I'm going to grandpa's to eat sweet potato.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.160
I like sweet potato.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:29.980
Ok

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.580
Go, let go eat buns

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.340
Dad

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.420

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.360
Now we are full.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:57.800
Not a bit full.

01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:59.080
How did you know?

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.060
it's all finished but you still want to eat.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:03.640
Tasty?

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:04.660

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.340
Very very tasty.

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.560
Very tasty.

Yummy food are like that, you want to eat more

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.660
Ha ha, you are already full

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.140
Quickly go home to sleep

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:19.540
Quick

My family,

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.120
have they left after eating?

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:40.700
They left in the afternoon.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.520
You brat.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.640
So late now, go home. mm?

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.000
Dad

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:09.360
Dad

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:10.980
Dad

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.620
What's this in the middle of the night?

Go home.

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:20.560
Sorry

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.420
Can I talk to my dad Ha So Yong?

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:24.700
Tricky little fellow

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.680
Honey, your son is here.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.320
What are you crying in the middle of night?

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.160
Quickly go home

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.100
If you buy me a bun

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.280
I will not call you dad.

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.580
Let your dad buy it for you.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:44.460
Really, I can do it.

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:46.820
haa

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.900
Can you hear that dog barking?

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.980
It's coming to bite you, quickly go!

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:56.720
ha

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.100
ha, I still want to eat.

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:00.820
Dad, can you please buy me more buns?

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.420
Ok, let's go

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.160
Mum

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.240
Mum

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:05.940
Hmm?

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:06.560
Mum

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:09.280
Mum, the buns are so yummy.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:09.780
really yummy?

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:11.600
-really yummy
-really yummy

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:12.900
Quickly go to sleep

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.320
Buns from the shops are so yummy

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:16.280
Let's eat buns all the time

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.920
Now, my mouth is full of bun taste

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.060
Me too

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.240
What did you say to first happiness?

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.040
Ask him what he wants to eat.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.520
He wants to eat sweet potato so I let him go to my uncle's place.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.180
First happiness went to Ha So Yong's home.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.680
and asked him for food

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.720
He called Ha So Yong dad.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.040
and begged him .

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.500
Look

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:41.100
Why raise someone else's kid?

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.560
What for?

01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:46.780
Eventually, they will look for their real father.

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:50.420
Aigoo, ungrateful child, what can we do, little brat.

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.900
We still buy him something good to eat.

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:57.240
Cover yourself with a blanket and go to sleep.

01:15:58.380 --> 01:15:59.340
Where are you going?

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.680
Going to find first happiness.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.000
What are you doing?

01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:49.220
Come out, you little brat

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:51.920
Go home.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:03.140
You treat me less than an animal even though I've raised you for 11 years.

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.900
That bastard Ha So Yong is your real dad.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:10.420
Tse, what is happening?

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:12.820
First happiness

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:14.280
First happiness

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:19.140
Honey, I found that crazy kid

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.160
You're dead meat, go!!

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.180
Where did you go?

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:30.380
You really not going to listen to your mum?

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:32.840
Mum

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:34.500
Sorry

01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:37.580
I'm wrong

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:39.960
No

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.540
Mum is sorry.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.380
Sorry, mum

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.740
Mum is sorry

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:53.480
Let's go home

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.380
First happiness, let's go

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:20.960
Is he dead?

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:24.680
Quickly wake him.

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.880
This is karma.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:39.600
What goes around comes around

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.520
Just like Ha So Yong.

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.000
ha ha , yes.

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:47.660
Uncle, from now on, I will be thankful for life.

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.000
Kids, the rice is cooked, time to eat.

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:55.280
People need to learn to forgive.
-Wait a minute, we will be there soon.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:00.800
The x-ray showed nothing abnormal for Mr ho,

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.380
but according to my experience,

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.540
I wonder if there is any problem with the brain.

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:14.520
What can we do? There is no surgery available.

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.680
What about another hospital.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.260
Seoul.

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:24.260
A bigger hospital might have a way.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.040
OK..

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.020
Sorry.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.600
He has a son.

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:40.900
The son will have to pray for his father at home.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:44.420
Ha So Yong's spirit might come back.

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:49.240
Priest, but we don't have a son.

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:51.640
Only two girls.

01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:54.540
Can it not be girls?

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:58.580
Daughters are like throw away water.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:04.540
Even when their sound is loud and clear,
the soul will not hear it.

01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:06.260
What can we do?

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.680
Priest, cannot be this way.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.360
Isnt there another way?

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:16.580
Very strange

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:17.800
what?

01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:26.260
why are you lying?

01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:29.840
I didnt.

01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:38.100
Argh, uncle did you know about this?

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.960
The doctor could not save him

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:45.620
Even the priest said he won't be able to save him.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.380
Only first happiness can save my husband.

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:53.000
If First happiness call him, would he be able to hear him?

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.060
Wouldn't it be like a dog's bark?

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:56.900
When he bought buns for first happiness,

01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.280
He said first happiness barked like a dog.

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:03.620
Ah What are you talking about, so annoying.

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:08.440
If you've finished talking,

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:09.800
Please go.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.520
I beg you.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.540
Help me once,

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.000
Please save my husband.

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.220
Find a good school for first happiness to study,

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.140
Give him good food to eat

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:24.920
Only then, can we say we love first happiness

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:31.880
We will pay for his education.

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:35.580
I beg you.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:41.020
So, you want to sell first happiness with money?

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.840
We don't neccessary need those things.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.140
No, I will not let him go.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.260
Whenever I think of Ha So Yong, I shiver with anger everynight.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.940
But, now you want to let first happiness go?

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.300
Can you get him a good school?

01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:58.800
Even food to you is a problem.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.920
For first happiness's sake, send him home.

01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:05.620
Let him have a good life.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:06.620
No, absolutely not.

01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:07.520
No

01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:27.160
What is more important than human life?

01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:30.760
Don't worry,

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:35.600
it's not only because of first happiness.

01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:38.560
In the end, it's about saving someone's life.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.960
I've raised you for 11 years.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.720
Hit you so many times,

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.800
Yelled at you so many times.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:06.080
Especially when that bad truth came out.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:10.440
Don't hold it in your heart.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.120
I don't want to admit.

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:25.140
Ha So Yong's family say they will treat you like theirs.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.260
You know, Ha So Yong is currently very sick.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:34.920
First happiness, only you can save him.

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:39.260
Yes, what is more important than human life?

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.400
First save his life.

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:45.620
First happiness.

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:49.840
When you grow up.

01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:54.880
I don't expect you to do anything for mum and dad.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.040
When mum and dad are on the death bed,

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.560
It is enough for you to just remember that we once raised you,

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:08.720
and shed a few tears for us.

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:11.300
We will be content.

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:50.000
(spell)

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.620
This window is the path in and out of this house.

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.300
Block the window so that your husband cannot go out.

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:15.200
Let's begin.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:20.160
First happiness, let's start.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:34.960
(spell)

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:38.800
You say "dad, please quickly come back, dad please don't go"

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.680
Dad, please come back, don't go.

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:44.980
Louder

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.580
Why do I have to say these?

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.060
Isn't your dad sick?

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.480
Didn't you tell him beforehand?

01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:00.040
My dad is now at the market.

01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:02.260
Xu san is not your dad.

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:06.560
This person in front of you is your real dad.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.720
First happiness, that's ok, let's try it again.

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:28.520
(spell)

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.020
Mum, I cannot do it.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.140
What? What did you say?

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.180
(Daddy don't go, daddy please come back)

01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:56.760
Just read this then.

01:26:58.660 --> 01:26:59.380
Quickly

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.300
Time is running out, first happiness.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.900
Whatever's wrong, just

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:14.780
do it for now.

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:15.720
Quick.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.340
First happiness, quickly read it.

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.060
Daddy please dont go,

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.600
Lift your head up and say it louder.

01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:33.420
Daddy please don't go.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.340
Daddy please come back, Is this ok?

01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:40.980
It has to be done for one hour. With your voice, two hours wouldn't even be enough

01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:44.860
Use your sincerity

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:47.820
Come, let's start.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.100
Read, read!

01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:01.780
Daddy, please don't go, come back.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:06.860
Daddy, please don't go, come back.

01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:07.540
Louder

01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:08.900
Daddy, please don't go

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.900
Can you do it properly?

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.820
Can't you be a bit louder?

01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:16.240
Your real dad is about to die.

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:21.960
How can you save him with this attitude?!

01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:28.480
Please talk some sense into him!

01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:31.400
Let's pack up, I'm tired.

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:38.460
First happiness, do it quickly so we can go home.

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.500
Dad, please don't go!

01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:45.700
Dad, please come back! This loud?!

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:50.080
Don't say it to me, say it to your dad!

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.380
Lift your head up, do you really have to be like this?!!

01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:55.780
Why are rushing and shouting at the kid!??

01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.340
I will talk to him

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.440
Really want to make me angry?

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:03.120
Quickly call.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:04.880
Quickly call.

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:07.240
Not going to do it huh?

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:08.320
Quickly call.

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.200
Quickly do it so that we can go home. Hurry.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.200
Dad, don't go

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:18.740
Dad, come back

01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:20.080
Repeat again.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.160
Dad, don't go, dad come back

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:40.760
Dad, don't go, dad come back

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.900
Louder, louder

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:46.320
Dad, don't go, dad come back

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.560
Dad, don't go, dad come back

01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:54.720
Dad, don't go,

01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:01.540
Dad

01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:07.360
Dad, don't go, dad come back

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:13.040
Dad, don't go. Dad, don't go.

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.200
Dad

01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:18.240
Dad, please take me away.

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:19.760
Dad

01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.200
Dad, don't go.

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:24.120
Take away? What are you talking about?

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:28.880
Dad, Dad, Dad, please take me away.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:30.980
Dad

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.860
Dad, don't go.

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.480
Dad,  please come get me.

01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:39.600
Dad

01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:42.520
Please take me home.

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.160
Dad, come back.

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:50.660
Dad, I'm afraid, I'm wrong.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.300
Dad, come back.

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.880
Dad, I want to go home.

01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:00.540
Dad, Dad.

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:05.840
Enough! Enough! Damn!

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:12.300
Come here first happiness.

01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:13.940
Dad.

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:17.720
The kid is scared. Damn you.

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:23.720
Let's go honey.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:41.180
Big brother

01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:45.180
Big brother

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.340
-Big brother
-Big brother

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:46.480
Quickly get up

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.180
-Big brother
-Don't joke.

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.560
-Big brother, don't joke
-quickly get up.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.300
-Big brother
-don't joke

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:54.800
Big brother, don't joke

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:55.980
quickly get up

01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.540
Big brother quickly get up

01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.020
When was he like this?

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.600
He fainted in the fields today.

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.020
No, not that.

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.760
When did he first started fainting.

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:23.700
I don't know.

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:33.500
I don't know whether this is the right time to tell you this.

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:41.180
I wonder if it's similar to Ha So Yong's sickness.

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.160
Give way, give way.

01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.140
You go first,

01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:58.640
What about you?

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.100
I will go borrow some money, I will find you guys tomorrow.

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:02.960
Register him into the hospital first, understand?

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:03.880
Quickly go.

01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:10.800
You need to rest 3 months each time you sell blood.

01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:13.980
You don't know how to look after your body.

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:16.840
Who will take responsibility for your death?

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.700
I will be responsible.

01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:23.280
If you were to die, I will be unlucky.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.780
That's called malpractice.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:27.920
I will definitely die.

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:32.260
This is all my money.

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.120
Sorry

01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:35.240
Thank you

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:37.220
What kind of sickness?

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.900
A headache.

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:43.640
I'm not quite sure, I just need some money.

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:47.980
I'm very sorry, I don't have any money

01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:49.620
Sorry

01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:58.240
I have debt to repay, what can I do?

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.040
Please lend me some money.

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:09.980
What has your son's sickness got to do with me, why should I lend?

01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:14.240
Isn't first happiness Ha So Yong's son?

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:18.360
Once he is better, I will bring him home.

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:22.820
Kids, have you got any money?

01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:25.440
No

01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:33.800
Because I've seen you before, I'll lend you some.

01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:37.340
We have to look after our family.

01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:39.520
Second happiness, you have to look after third happiness.

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:40.380
Come

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.940
Don't come here, go somewhere else

01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:51.060
Other places don't know when and how often you've given blood

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:58.860
If you die over there, it's not my responsibility.

01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:19.550
(Stop receiving)

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:24.660
We have a lot of patient waiting for treatment.

01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:28.460
There's a child named first happiness that should have been admitted yesterday.

01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:31.960
The mum came with the child to be admitted.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:33.340

01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:36.100
They came late last night.

01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:38.720
But they are not on the admitted list.

01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:41.320
Did any child leave last night?

01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:42.260
Wait a minute.

01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:46.500
About this tall, pale face, having a headache.

01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:50.040
Please find him, Xu first happiness.

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:50.860

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.780
Last night from Gongju to Daejeon Hospital

01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:05.460
Wasn't there a mother last night who grabbed and begged a doctor to save her son?

01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:05.960
Yes

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.940
The encephalitis patient?

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:08.820
Encephalitis?

01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:10.720
Where are they now?

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:12.220
Went to seoul

01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:15.240

01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.440
(52-8735/53-3986 Chang new road 150)

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:36.860
Hello, was there an encephalitis patient admitted today?

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.640
Yes, 11 years old.

01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:47.140
Encephalitis, our first happiness has encephalitis.

01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:51.660
Don't cry, say it properly.

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:54.800
so, how is he now?

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:56.880
No awareness,

01:37:58.260 --> 01:37:59.700
don't know if he will live.

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:06.560
This hospital is big in Seoul, shouldn't be a problem.

01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:10.560
We have to pay the fees first before he can stay here.

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:13.140
I know

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.680
You talk with the doctor, tell him the boy's father will bring the money in 3 days.

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:22.580
I will come as soon as he has the treatment.

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:26.420

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:31.200
I've borrowed from friends,

01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:34.020

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.840

It's not going to be a problem.

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.300
I said go.

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:49.580

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.280
No

01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:55.740
Just one more time.

01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:57.040
Don't come again.

01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:58.600

01:41:59.080 --> 01:41:59.700

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.700
My husband will come with the money.

01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:04.920
Please give us some more time.

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:25.640
Uncle, are you sleeping?

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:30.860
Uncle, can you hear a dou dou sound?

01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:33.860
It's the sound blood makes when it hits the glass bottles.

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:40.100
There are alot of people here because they know blood can be sold.

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.700
But do you know what people don't know?

01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:49.460
Uncle

01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:51.120
Uncle

01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:53.740

01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:55.440
Take the needle out first.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.140
Uncle

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.040
How much blood has he sold?

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:04.940
Check his blood pressure.

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.320
uncle

01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:08.320
uncle

01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.520
I mean,

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:17.620
even though, they take 10 litres of blood, people still come back.

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.140
Are you normal now?

01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:22.060
Uncle, why are you still selling blood with your current health status?

01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:22.860
I..

01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:26.440
I can understand if I've received my own blood back

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:28.160
But

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:30.920
how can you give me other people's blood without my consent?

01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:32.000
and you charged a fee.

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:32.480
I know, uncle,

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.420
Go and pay the fees.

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:34.240
I said,

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.000
Take back what's not mine,

01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:40.320
take the other people's blood back out.

01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:45.280
Please talk sense uncle,

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.760

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:01.720

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:04.500
