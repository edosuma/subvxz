00:32.032 --> 00:34.784
<i>Oh, boy!
Another day</i><i>of triple-digit temperatures!</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:35.910
<i>Now it's official.</i>

00:35.994 --> 00:38.872
<i>This heat wave has lasted</i>
<i>longer than my second marriage.</i>

00:38.955 --> 00:40.582
-
<i>So wherever you are, Rhonda,</i>

00:40.665 --> 00:42.333
<i>this song goes out to you.</i>

00:42.417 --> 00:44.502
Whoa. Too hot.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.629
Can't make it to my house.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.968
Ahh.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.887
Mmm. Hmm.

00:53.970 --> 00:54.804
Dang!

00:54.888 --> 00:57.098


00:58.183 --> 01:00.602
-

01:01.102 --> 01:02.812
-

01:05.231 --> 01:07.025


01:08.651 --> 01:09.778
Well, I'll be!

01:09.861 --> 01:11.613
I guess that makes it official.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.031
It's summer, all right.

01:13.114 --> 01:13.990
Is it me?

01:14.074 --> 01:18.036
Or did it just get a few degrees cooler
since Boomhauer walked out?

01:18.119 --> 01:20.914
Oh, man. Golly.
That's dang ol' breezy, man.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.625
Man, that's a straight cut.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.085
Will you do me a half shirt?

01:27.754 --> 01:30.423
-

01:31.925 --> 01:34.052
-

01:34.636 --> 01:36.012
Nice Daisy Dukes.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.857
Bobby, have you seen my...

01:47.941 --> 01:49.609


01:49.692 --> 01:52.987
Joseph, isn't it time
you think about heading home?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.864

I can't take it at my house.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.283
My dad has the heat cranked
all the way up.

01:57.367 --> 02:01.955
He said something about fighting fire
with fire, but it wasn't working for me.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.498
Quiet! Look!

02:03.581 --> 02:08.128
<i>♪ Get wild, get wet, get cool</i>
<i>Go bananas, oooo ♪</i>

02:08.211 --> 02:11.131

02:23.017 --> 02:24.561
<i>♪ Go bananas ♪</i>

02:25.186 --> 02:26.604
We have to go!

02:26.688 --> 02:28.356
Dad, will you take us?

02:28.439 --> 02:29.566
Please?

02:29.649 --> 02:33.319
Yeah, you got to take us, dude.
I'm starting to leave a butt puddle!

02:33.403 --> 02:36.906
Fine. Just put on your pants.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.165
That's not good at all.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.011
<i>-Hank Hill here.</i>
-Hank, it's Bill.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.263
I got a flat on the bypass.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.348
It's hot. It's hot!

03:02.432 --> 03:03.850
It's so hot.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.268
You got to come get me!

03:06.436 --> 03:07.520
Fine.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.315
Dangit. Now I got to go pick up
Mister Dauterive.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.859
You kids remember the exit
to the water park?

03:12.942 --> 03:16.696
<i>♪ Take the second left

03:16.779 --> 03:21.326
No, dude.
<i>♪ It's slight left on Encinita Boulevard ♪</i>

03:21.409 --> 03:22.660
No. It's...

03:22.744 --> 03:29.000
<i>♪ Get wet, get wild, get cool,
go bananas, off the San Pedro exit ♪</i>

03:29.083 --> 03:30.501
It's right there.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.712
Thank God!

03:36.799 --> 03:39.052
Where's Hank? I can't take it!

03:40.053 --> 03:41.429
Help!

03:41.512 --> 03:42.889
I need help!

03:53.233 --> 03:55.276
They're, they're waving at me.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.279
They're really waving at me.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.824
I'm waving at you, and you, and you!

04:02.825 --> 04:03.826
Hello!

04:07.247 --> 04:09.415
Do you guys hear that?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.000
That's water!

04:13.753 --> 04:16.047
Look how high that slide goes!

04:20.635 --> 04:22.387
That's The Avalanche.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.763
And it's horrifying.

04:23.846 --> 04:28.559
Some kid went on it and all that came out
the bottom was a bathing suit.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.728
They never found him.

04:30.812 --> 04:34.232
I heard in the middle of the slide,
there's a moment

04:34.315 --> 04:39.070
where you're traveling so fast
you actually become water.

04:40.571 --> 04:41.864
Three tickets, please.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.449
Would you like to get summer passes?

04:43.533 --> 04:45.702
-No.
-Please, Dad?

04:45.785 --> 04:48.579
If you won't do it for me,
do it for your lawn.

04:48.663 --> 04:52.250
A Slip 'n Slide can be very destructive.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.543
Okay.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.879
But this is your entire
summer-entertainment budget.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.756
Don't come to me in a couple of days

04:58.840 --> 05:02.844
and say you're bored of the water park
like you did with the French horn lessons,

05:02.927 --> 05:04.971
the karate lessons, and spy camp.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.682
I won't. I'll be
too refreshed to bother you.

05:11.477 --> 05:15.773
Hey, man, dang ol' air hockey, man.
Who wants dang ol', take on a champ, man?

05:25.867 --> 05:27.493
Let me see what you got.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.125
Hi there.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.877
Have a nice day.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.628
Bill, your tire's fixed.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.172
You can get out of here now.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.590
In a minute. Ooh.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.592
I got a school bus coming.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.510
Hey there, children!

05:44.594 --> 05:46.095
Hi!

05:46.179 --> 05:47.764
Uh.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.016
Bill, it's over a hundred degrees out.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.934
And you don't have...

05:52.101 --> 05:53.561
...how do I say this?

05:53.644 --> 05:56.314
You don't have many "health" assets.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.815
You should get inside.

06:06.115 --> 06:08.076
<i>It is a hot one today,
I tell you.</i>

06:08.159 --> 06:09.911
<i>Too hot for pants.</i>

06:09.994 --> 06:11.704
<i>Yikes!</i><i>I got to work
with this guy, people.</i>

06:11.788 --> 06:13.998
<i>And he's serious
about taking off</i><i>his pants.</i>

06:14.082 --> 06:14.999
<i>I am.</i>

06:15.083 --> 06:16.417
<i>But I'll tell you, one resident</i>

06:16.501 --> 06:17.919
<i>of</i><i>Arlen</i><i>is offering this community</i>

06:18.002 --> 06:21.881
<i>a little relief from the heat</i>
<i>in</i><i>the</i><i>form</i><i>of a kind cool wave</i>

06:21.964 --> 06:23.633
<i>from the side of</i><i>the</i><i>highway.</i>

06:23.716 --> 06:25.551
<i>People toss around the word hero.</i>

06:25.635 --> 06:27.929
<i>But this guy's a real hero.</i>
<i>I</i><i>don't</i><i>know</i><i>his name.</i>

06:28.012 --> 06:31.099
<i>So I guess we can only call him</i>
<i>"The Heat-Waver."</i>

06:31.182 --> 06:33.267
<i>Thank you, Heat-Waver!</i>

06:36.604 --> 06:38.815
They talked about me on the radio!

06:38.898 --> 06:41.234
I matter. Take that, Dad!

06:56.582 --> 06:58.418
That's the kid from the commercial!

06:58.501 --> 07:00.420
And he's going bananas!

07:02.004 --> 07:03.965
-Visor dude, you're in.
-Yeah!

07:04.048 --> 07:06.175
Hot girl, you're definitely in.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.552
What about us?

07:07.635 --> 07:10.263
Why don't you kiddies hit up the tad-pool?

07:10.346 --> 07:11.556
Get out of here!

07:11.639 --> 07:13.558
Locals only, mothers!

07:13.641 --> 07:14.892
Get off our wave!

07:19.564 --> 07:20.690
Maybe we should go.

07:20.773 --> 07:21.774
No way!

07:21.858 --> 07:26.404
I didn't spend my entire summer budget
to slide down a little frog tongue.

07:29.991 --> 07:33.035
-Can I help you?
-Oh, thank goodness. An adult.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.663
We want to ride, but they won't let us!

07:35.746 --> 07:36.873
I see.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.500
Then I guess it sucks to be you.

07:40.293 --> 07:45.923
What? I have a summer pass.
And I demand to cool down and get wet!

07:46.007 --> 07:47.300
Hey, Harky!

07:48.468 --> 07:49.886
These kids want to get wet.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.220
You know what that means.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.556
Yeah. Full on, Bodie.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.769
Welcome to the Avalanche.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.564
You must ride feet first with your arms
crossed over your chest.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.359
Don't do this!

08:05.443 --> 08:07.320
Ride this wave, grommet!

08:11.699 --> 08:14.243
I think he just turned into water.

08:19.874 --> 08:23.669
They wouldn't let us ride
because we weren't "locals"!

08:23.753 --> 08:24.921
Locals only?

08:25.004 --> 08:26.589
That's the most insane thing

08:26.672 --> 08:27.548
I've ever heard of.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.967
Nobody lives in an amusement park.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.677
That is so weird.

08:31.761 --> 08:36.015
Because I always have really good
experiences with surfers.

08:36.098 --> 08:38.476
Didn't they help
put your sunscreen on, Bobby?

08:38.559 --> 08:39.393
No!

08:39.477 --> 08:43.898
I got it. I have found that
bullies are actually very insecure.

08:43.981 --> 08:48.861
Tomorrow, tell him he has a nice smile,
and he will become your best friend.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.571
I'm not going back.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.949
They specifically told me not to.

08:53.032 --> 08:56.118
By the way, I'm gonna need
some money for the mall.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.286
No, you don't.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.080
We're going back to that water park.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.040
And I'll deal with those locals.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.209
Not all surfers are bad, Bobby.

09:03.292 --> 09:07.964
I read in a magazine about a girl surfer
who was attacked by a shark.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.926
And against all odds,
she still managed to be pretty.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.013
Happy hump day!

09:16.097 --> 09:19.934
Hang in there! It's almost Friday!
Buckle up now!

09:21.102 --> 09:22.853
Stay cool, Arlen!

09:36.450 --> 09:39.161
Welcome to Big Water!
Can I point you to the gift shop?

09:39.245 --> 09:44.667
No. My son wants to ride on your "Endless
Wave" but some giblet heads won't let him.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.043
They're giblet heads!

09:46.127 --> 09:48.879
And the last time I checked,
this was America.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.089
U.S.A.!

09:50.172 --> 09:52.967
That is terrible.
I will take care of this immediately.

09:53.050 --> 09:56.596
Big Water may be owned by Germans,
but we have very American policies

09:56.679 --> 09:58.264
when it comes to customer service.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.265
Well, all right.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.020
Excuse me, Bodie.
Can I speak to you for a second?

10:04.103 --> 10:06.105
Of course, Tim. What's up?

10:06.188 --> 10:08.190
Tell him what's up, Tim.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.027
This kid's daddy just came
and talked to me about you guys.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.362
I just call him dad.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.530
Dangit, Bodie.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.367
I don't ask any questions
about what goes on on Coconut Island.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.077
Now, I'm leaving this boy in your hands,

10:20.161 --> 10:21.996
and I don't want to have
to come back here.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.873
In fact, I'm not coming back here.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.709
Because I trust that you'll take good care
of this situation.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.544
Yes, sir, Tim.

10:30.046 --> 10:33.466
No, no, no. Wait, wait.
Tim, don't leave now!

10:38.387 --> 10:41.140
Tim...

10:41.223 --> 10:43.017
Yep.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.185
Yep.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.228
Oh, man, oh, man.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.568
What are you kids doing back already?

10:52.652 --> 10:55.071
The locals messed with us again.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.741
I go to get the kids and those punks
throw me down Avalanche Two!

10:58.824 --> 11:01.118
And they disrespected my half-shirt!

11:01.202 --> 11:05.331
-What happened to the manager?
-That manager made things worse!

11:05.414 --> 11:09.335
I got thrown down the Avalanche naked!

11:09.418 --> 11:13.255
-Joseph, why didn't you help him?
-Because I ran away.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.341
Nicely done.

11:15.424 --> 11:19.595
I'm never going back to that park again
so long as there are surfers.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.223
Maybe you could talk to those guys,
Boomhauer.

11:22.306 --> 11:25.976
Boomhauer used to be the best surfer
in Corpus Christi.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.812
Now, I don't know about that, man.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.939
What do you mean? You were amazing.

11:30.022 --> 11:33.651
King of the beach, a Golden God
on a wooden board!

11:35.194 --> 11:37.738
Not too bad. You know, good ol'...

11:37.822 --> 11:41.283
Do you really think you could talk
some sense into these guys, Boomhauer?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.743
Of course he could!

11:51.669 --> 11:54.839
Wow. Look how stable he is.

12:00.010 --> 12:03.180
-Is this even surfing?
-I think it's kayaking.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.317
Bill, what are you doing out here?
You look terrible.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.278
We got to get you inside now.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.487
No.

12:18.571 --> 12:23.200
I won't go! I have a responsibility
to the people of Arlen!

12:26.579 --> 12:28.748
Stop looking at me like that, Peggy!

12:28.831 --> 12:29.665
Stop it!

12:41.510 --> 12:43.304
Yeah, I've surfed all the big waves.

12:43.387 --> 12:46.432
Six Flags, Busch Gardens,
even tore up Tivoli World.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.517
That's in Malaga, Spain.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.643
Yeah, buddy!

12:50.936 --> 12:53.939
-Hey, man. Come on now, you little...
-Just tell us when it's safe.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.320
Hey, brahs. Check out this hodad.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.697
What are you looking for, brah?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.491
I'm talking about them little kids, man.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.786
You got to let them kids ride, man.
I'm talking one surfer to another, man.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.163
Well, if you're really a surfer
like you say you are,

13:09.246 --> 13:11.540
then you'll do your talking on the wave.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.211
That's the only language I comprende.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.545
Comprende?

13:21.842 --> 13:25.763
Check it out, Harky.
You order a picnic table?

13:25.846 --> 13:27.264
This old dude's confused.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.518
Your shorts should be long,
and your board should be short.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.478
You got it backwards, broham!

13:36.732 --> 13:39.026
Do you have a shorter board,
Mister Boomhauer?

13:39.109 --> 13:41.779
Hey, man, it's like I said,
dang ol' surfin's surfin', man.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.287
You show them how we do it in Arlen,
Mister Boomhauer!

13:55.084 --> 13:56.502
Dang. Dang.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.462
-Dang ol', man...
-Fog!

13:58.546 --> 14:00.297
Crumbeater!

14:00.965 --> 14:02.216
Loser!

14:03.342 --> 14:05.970
Do they have air conditioning
at the library?

14:14.353 --> 14:16.105
Use it or lose it, old friend.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.357
You losed it.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.846
So just the two of us today, huh, Hank?

14:48.929 --> 14:51.056
Yup.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.349
Huh.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.895
So it's just, uh, me and you then.

14:55.978 --> 14:59.857
Just two men drinking together,
not in a group.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.321
I'm gonna go check on Bill.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.573
Yes! Go get Bill! Great idea.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.951
Bill? It's Hank.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.873
Just wanted to stop by
and see how you're doing.

15:15.956 --> 15:18.334
Oh, I'm feeling much better.

15:20.544 --> 15:22.212
Aah.

15:23.047 --> 15:26.508
-I'm getting back on the road, Hank.
-Absolutely not.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.969
But I'm the Heat-Waver!

15:29.053 --> 15:30.054
The...

15:31.221 --> 15:32.806
You're not leaving this home!

15:36.393 --> 15:40.439
Oh! Oh, the burns! My skin hurts!

15:42.608 --> 15:44.151
Okay, okay.

15:44.234 --> 15:47.821
I won't get back out there today.
But you got to do something for me, Hank.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.199
-What?
-Be my arms.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.867
Wave for me, Hank.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.788
Wave to everyone, especially
the old people and children.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.706
Wave to the children, Hank.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.584
And only give the thumbs-up to truckers.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.586
You'll do that for me, won't you, Hank?

16:03.212 --> 16:04.630
No.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.299
Then I have nothing more to say to you.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.390
Just, please!

16:14.473 --> 16:16.016
Do it now!

16:16.100 --> 16:17.685
The Department of Water and Power

16:17.768 --> 16:20.854
requested everyone conserve energy
until 6:00 p.m.

16:20.938 --> 16:24.191
But your father had to show off
and counter with 7:00.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.121
Hey, Bobby. How was the surf today?

16:37.204 --> 16:40.082
Did Boomhauer do his famous flamingo?

16:40.165 --> 16:44.461
That's when he stands on one leg.
That's not easy to do even on the ground.

16:44.545 --> 16:49.008
No. All he did was fall flat on his face
and embarrass himself.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.926
And us by association.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.137
We didn't even get to ride The Wave.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.514
Boomhauer was embarrassed?

16:55.597 --> 16:57.474
I don't know
what the heck's going on here.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.144
But someone needs to get
their asses kicked.

17:00.227 --> 17:02.938
Finally. Yes! Thank you!

17:03.022 --> 17:05.566
It's time to kick their local asses!

17:05.649 --> 17:07.234
Bobby, language.

17:07.317 --> 17:11.321
But yes, I am going to kick their asses.

18:05.584 --> 18:06.543
Hey, man.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.961
That was a dang ol' good set, eh?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.213
Yeah, brah.

18:09.296 --> 18:10.672
You paddling out?

18:10.756 --> 18:13.967
No, man, you know.
Just like a, like a dang ol' dog, man.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.220
Can't pick up them new tricks, man.

18:16.303 --> 18:17.513
Pshaw, brah!

18:17.596 --> 18:18.931
New wave, man, you know?

18:19.014 --> 18:21.350
-Can't beat it, man.
-Yeah!

18:21.433 --> 18:24.603
Can't beat the wave, brah,
beat the surfer.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.605
"Beat the surfer."

18:41.537 --> 18:43.122
<i>Another hot one today!</i>

18:43.205 --> 18:46.083
<i>Too hot for me.
And apparently too hot</i><i>for the Heat-Waver.</i>

18:47.167 --> 18:50.879
<i>It appears that the heat</i>
<i>has</i><i>beaten</i><i>the Heat-Waver.</i>

18:50.963 --> 18:52.881
<i>This Heat-Waver has stuck a knife</i>

18:52.965 --> 18:55.843
<i>into the hope of the commuters</i>
<i>of</i><i>this</i><i>city and twisted it.</i>

18:55.926 --> 18:57.386
<i>We would have been better off,</i>

18:57.469 --> 19:01.723
<i>had he never shown up</i>
<i>with</i><i>his</i><i>teasing of cool kindness.</i>

19:06.061 --> 19:08.188
Check this Barney and the wranglers.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.566
This ain't no rodeo, brodad.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.859
Well, it certainly isn't.

19:11.942 --> 19:15.737
At the rodeo, people have talent
and treat each other with respect.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.738
Yeah, respect!

19:16.822 --> 19:19.324
You have to earn respect.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.118
Yeah, you must be Bodie.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.411
And you must be a pud.

19:22.494 --> 19:25.747
-Listen, man, if you want to surf...
-I didn't come here to surf.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.708
Well, what'd you come here to do?

19:27.791 --> 19:28.959
To kick your ass.

19:30.961 --> 19:31.962
I bail!

19:34.590 --> 19:37.676
Hey, man.
I'm gonna take it from here, man.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.015
No! No more talking!

19:43.098 --> 19:44.641
No more surfing!

19:44.725 --> 19:48.687
My dad's finally gonna set things right
on Coconut Island!

19:48.770 --> 19:50.731
Hey, man. This is my time, man.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.154
You can't surf.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.488
You're old!

19:58.572 --> 20:00.032
And you're not gonna surf.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.868
Talking about ol' dang ol'
beat the surfer, man.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.621
Aah.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.376
I wouldn't do that, son.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.385
Aah.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.221
Aah.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.061
JOSEPH and BOBBY: Oh, yeah!

20:30.812 --> 20:33.857
Yeah! Yeah!

20:37.486 --> 20:39.446
Aah.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.743
The flamingo! The flamingo!

20:45.035 --> 20:46.787
Yeah!

20:48.288 --> 20:50.540
Dang ol'... Dang ol', my knees, man.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.464
Whoo.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.219
<i>Some amazing news</i>
<i>just in from the Slappy Van.</i>

21:02.302 --> 21:04.221
<i>The Heat-Waver is back!</i>

21:04.304 --> 21:07.099
<i>The Heat-Waver is back!</i>

21:07.182 --> 21:09.685
<i>There just might be hope</i>
<i>for this town after all.</i>

21:52.602 --> 21:55.188
-<i>This ain't no rodeo, brodad.</i>
