Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express.

00:06.160 --> 00:10.159
Come and watch pikeys making a mess
of the lives they were given...

00:11.280 --> 00:13.639
by 'im upstairs.

00:13.640 --> 00:17.119
And kids they're convinced...
aren't actually theirs.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.159
Stay away!

00:18.160 --> 00:20.719
What sounds on earth
could ever replace...

00:20.720 --> 00:21.279
Oi!

00:21.280 --> 00:24.839
..kids needing money,
or wives in your face.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.399
Cos this, people reckon,

00:26.400 --> 00:30.399
and me included, is why pubs
and drugs were kindly invented.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.119
To calm us all down,
stop us going mental.

00:36.120 --> 00:40.119
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:40.600 --> 00:44.599
We are worth every penny,
for grinding your axes...

00:44.920 --> 00:47.119
You shit on our heads,

00:47.120 --> 00:51.119
but you pay the taxes.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.599
Imagine a Britain without
Chatsworth buccaneers,

00:55.600 --> 00:58.479
who'd cum on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:58.480 --> 01:01.919
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs, now!

01:01.920 --> 01:04.519

01:04.519 --> 01:07.159

'Being a mum, a wife, I thought
that's all I ever wanted...

01:36.560 --> 01:39.599
'Thought it made me happy.
How wrong was I?

01:39.600 --> 01:43.599
'For too long now, I've counted
on family for my happiness.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.359
'Might as well popped Prozac for 30
years, for all the good it's done me.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.359
'To think, all those wasted years...
I could have been a page three model.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.919
'Don't get me wrong -
I wouldn't change it.'

01:57.920 --> 01:59.119
Full Irish, sir.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.199
Full Irish, sir.
Full Irish what?

02:01.200 --> 02:03.839
'But I can't help wondering
how different

02:03.840 --> 02:05.399
'life could have been for me.'

02:05.400 --> 02:07.519
Thought about council.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.439
'From now on, it's MY time...

02:10.440 --> 02:12.839
'I want to do what makes ME happy.

'I'm getting me tits out.

(GROANS)

02:40.600 --> 02:43.119
Dad...eh, I've been thinking...

02:43.120 --> 02:45.679
Dad...eh, I've been thinking...
Don't, son. It'll only hurt.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.839
It's been a while like, since...

02:48.840 --> 02:51.799
A man like yourself has needs
and, erm, it's not like

02:52.360 --> 02:54.199
You need to get laid.

02:54.200 --> 02:58.199
A good shag'll put
the spring back in your step.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.639
Business is in good shape,
you need some YOU time.

03:01.640 --> 03:05.639
We thought we'd ease you
back into the game. Our treat.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.519
Mam's happy.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.559
We just want you to be.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.159
I am happy.

03:17.160 --> 03:20.879
I'm happy as a pig in shit.

(HE GROANS)

03:24.200 --> 03:28.199
Come on! Get in!

03:29.920 --> 03:33.199
Don't bother love - I've left
my magnifying glass at home.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.279
JEERING

03:35.280 --> 03:38.039
for the match today, boys.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.159
CHEERING

03:39.160 --> 03:43.159
Billy, man of the match again!

03:43.520 --> 03:46.759
And if we carry on playing like this

03:46.760 --> 03:50.359
we'll be sailing through
to the final.

03:50.360 --> 03:54.159
(CHANTING) BILLY! BILLY! BILLY!

03:54.160 --> 03:57.079
Come on, you - kit off, wash down.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.039
I've hardly worked up a sweat
sat on the sub bench, have I?

04:00.040 --> 04:01.839
When the fuck am I going to
get a game?

04:01.840 --> 04:03.599
Haven't had a look in
for the past three.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.199
You're slacking, Carl -

04:07.200 --> 04:11.119
I want more commitment off you
before I let you back on the pitch.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.999
See, Mickey's getting a shower
and he's only here as a supporter.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.039
CHEERING

04:16.040 --> 04:20.039
That's commitment.

04:23.520 --> 04:27.239
Pint. >

04:27.240 --> 04:28.479
Hello? >

04:28.480 --> 04:32.119
When you're ready, a pint.

04:32.120 --> 04:36.119
Fucking smiling depressive.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.839
You all right?

04:40.840 --> 04:42.239
Never been better.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.559
Face...smiling. Eyes...crying.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.279
in a minute.

04:48.280 --> 04:52.279
Thanks, Frank,
I will have one of me own.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.799
(CHANTING) GO! GO! GO! GO!

04:58.040 --> 05:00.479
Go on, Mickey, down it! Down it!

05:00.480 --> 05:02.799
Oh, bastard!

05:02.800 --> 05:06.799
CHEERING

05:10.040 --> 05:12.559
Billy, do us a favour.
Drop a match so I can get a game.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.599
Billy, do us a favour.
Drop a match so I can get a game.
What's it worth?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.959
Oi! Back in your box, Carl.
He's our secret weapon.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.199
Billy Tutton, future Man City star.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.559
Whisky-nose Ferguson'll be
tripping over himself to sign him.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.999
Billy bend-over.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.559
I mean...

05:25.560 --> 05:29.159
bend it. Bend it like Billy.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.439
Want a pint, Dad? >

05:30.440 --> 05:33.319
Aye, just the one. Off into town.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.439
Night out with my old comrades.

05:35.440 --> 05:39.439
We won't wait up.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.079
What's that?!

05:44.080 --> 05:46.639
What? I bought it here.

05:46.640 --> 05:50.639
You get a cut of what I paid for it,
anyway. You tax the bootleggers.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.639
Hmmm? Anyway, it's medicinal.

05:52.640 --> 05:56.639
Don't care.
Hand it over or get out.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.679
Going down.

06:07.680 --> 06:11.679
Then I shall bid you farewell...

06:12.040 --> 06:14.119
Lady jobsworth.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.519
Gambling with the shops profits?

06:16.520 --> 06:17.919
You've got balls,
I'll give you that. >

06:17.920 --> 06:19.239
You've got balls,
I'll give you that. >
Lucky balls.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.999
Anyway, this money's
from my own private fund.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.039
Show it's under new management.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.079
What to?

06:26.080 --> 06:27.759
Joe's Shop.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.159
That's shit.

06:29.160 --> 06:33.159
Customer's like simplicity, Ches.
First rule of business.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.439
You're hardly here.
There must be a rule against that?

06:38.440 --> 06:39.839
Second rule - delegation.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.959
Scrape off the dates on any of
the stock past its sell-by.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.199
And no more tick to Sohail.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.039
Right, he's to pay by Friday
or it's kneecaps.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.959
I've taught you well.
How about returning the favour?

06:50.960 --> 06:52.519
You got a tip for me?

06:52.520 --> 06:55.279
Never trust a man
who wears white shoes.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.279
White shoes?

06:59.800 --> 07:01.919
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
watch yourself -

07:01.920 --> 07:02.959
they're still wet.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.399
Assuming the print dries,
it's fucking ace work, mate.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.439
Fancy earning more?

07:08.440 --> 07:10.439
For a bigger cut.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.199
Sixty forty...

07:12.200 --> 07:16.199
to you.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.199
Was it a good night?

07:23.200 --> 07:24.519
Was it a good night?

07:24.520 --> 07:28.399
philosophising and skirt chasing
with my good pals Mossy and Tommo...

07:28.400 --> 07:29.959
Although to the untrained eye

07:29.960 --> 07:32.919
we looked like
degenerate binge drinkers.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.999
Just like old times.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.999
Only...one of them phoned
to say they couldn't make it.

07:51.720 --> 07:55.719
(BABBLES INCOHERENTLY)

08:04.280 --> 08:08.279
ARGHH!

08:23.440 --> 08:25.759
Are you ashamed of me?

08:25.760 --> 08:27.919
What's brought this on?

08:27.920 --> 08:31.919
All this sneaking about.

08:33.320 --> 08:37.239
You...this...it's all new to me.

08:37.240 --> 08:41.239
I need to get me head round it first,
before telling everyone.

08:42.240 --> 08:46.239
Because once we do,
it's everyone's business.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.679
I'm not ready for that yet.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.479
This is ours.

08:52.480 --> 08:56.079
I like what we have. It's simple. >

08:56.080 --> 08:58.599
You never let...

08:58.600 --> 09:00.039
You're always pleasing me.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.199
Force of habit, pleasing everyone.

09:02.200 --> 09:06.199
Even meself.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.159
Don't worry,

09:12.160 --> 09:15.039
I've never met a man yet,
who knew the right way to tickle

09:15.040 --> 09:19.039
the little man in his boat.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.139
Carl?

09:43.140 --> 09:45.899
Carl! Liam!

09:45.900 --> 09:49.899
I'm alive, I'm alive!Don't bury me!

09:54.580 --> 09:57.059
Thought I was a goner.

09:57.060 --> 10:01.019
I stay out for one night
and you piss all over my stuff!

10:01.020 --> 10:02.699
What time is it?

10:02.700 --> 10:06.499
Have you been drinking
Russian aftershave?

10:06.500 --> 10:09.499
I told you about drinking
bootleg Vodka, it's poisonous.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.539
People have died.

10:10.540 --> 10:14.539
Yeah, yeah. Just switch the
light on, Professor Know-It-All.

10:21.340 --> 10:25.339
Switch the fucking light on!

10:28.980 --> 10:31.339
What have you got there, love?

10:31.340 --> 10:33.339
That for me? Show Nana.

10:33.340 --> 10:34.979
Where did you get it?

10:34.980 --> 10:36.139
Those boys.

10:36.140 --> 10:40.139
Oi, dickheads! Which one of you
twats gave my granddaughter a spliff?

10:42.140 --> 10:43.819
Oi!

10:43.820 --> 10:47.819
You heard her, who was it?

10:56.820 --> 11:00.819
HEAVY BREATHING

11:11.220 --> 11:13.099
Doctors say you're doing well.

11:13.100 --> 11:16.939
It's going to be a bit of trial
and error with the medication,

11:16.940 --> 11:20.259
but it always is
with bipolar, apparently.

11:20.260 --> 11:24.139
Can we talk about something else?

11:24.140 --> 11:28.139
This is the only time
I get to feel normal in here.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.699
How is everyone?

11:35.700 --> 11:39.699
They don't come and visit.
They don't give a shit, I suppose.

11:40.060 --> 11:41.299
They do.

11:41.300 --> 11:45.259
It's been mad busy, everyone's
chipping in to help out.

11:45.260 --> 11:48.059
They send their love.

11:48.060 --> 11:52.059
We just want you better and
back home, the way it used to be.

12:04.380 --> 12:05.899
I've got a joke.

12:05.900 --> 12:08.379
Husband comes home to his wife
and he shouts,

12:08.380 --> 12:11.539
"I've won the Lottery,
so pack your bags."

12:11.540 --> 12:15.539
So she says,
"Well, what do I pack?"

12:15.540 --> 12:19.539
And he says...

12:24.500 --> 12:27.499
We'll get through this.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.779
He says...

12:28.780 --> 12:32.779
Be a proper family again. >

12:41.580 --> 12:44.499
And he says...

12:44.500 --> 12:46.419
And he says...

12:46.420 --> 12:47.739
Anyone see you?

12:47.740 --> 12:51.299
No.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.219
How old?

12:53.220 --> 12:55.979
14.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.459
I let you...

12:59.460 --> 13:01.459
Don't come near me!

13:01.460 --> 13:03.459
You was the only one
there who understood.

13:03.460 --> 13:06.019
You was the only one
there who understood.
It was a sympathy wank
that got out of hand.

13:06.020 --> 13:07.179
Does it matter? We love each other.

13:07.180 --> 13:11.179
Does it matter? We love each other.
If this gets out
or I see you again...

13:14.020 --> 13:18.019
..I'll kill you.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.459
Got it, yeah.

13:27.460 --> 13:29.299
Will he be OK?

13:29.300 --> 13:31.099
What's the diagnosis? >

13:31.100 --> 13:32.379
(MOUTHS)

13:32.380 --> 13:35.539
That vodka had 15 millilitres
of pure methylate in it.

13:35.540 --> 13:38.019
Dad's the 30th case the hospital's
had in the last two days.

13:38.020 --> 13:42.019
Dad's the 30th case the hospital's
had in the last two days.
Sit with me.

13:42.900 --> 13:46.579
For the first time in my life

13:46.580 --> 13:49.379
I'm incapable of
looking after myself.

13:49.380 --> 13:53.379
Now, I don't want
to be a burden, but...

13:54.460 --> 13:56.579
I've raised you three
with me own hands

13:56.580 --> 14:00.539
and we've come full circle -

14:00.540 --> 14:04.539
the father has become the son to...

14:04.940 --> 14:07.179
the father's sons...

14:07.180 --> 14:10.859
Get lost! Blind or blind drunk -
how is this different?

14:10.860 --> 14:12.459
It's only temporary.

14:12.460 --> 14:15.739
The chance of your eyesight
returning is 99.98%.

14:15.740 --> 14:17.339
I thought this
was something serious.

14:17.340 --> 14:19.139
I thought this
was something serious.
It is!

14:19.140 --> 14:23.139
I'm taking you out of school
to look after me.
I'll need a full-time carer.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.499
He's already missed school today
because of you.

14:25.500 --> 14:29.099
You don't live here,
you don't get a say.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.699
Grab us a beer from the fridge.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.739
If you want your eyesight back,
you've got to detox -

14:33.740 --> 14:36.379
no drink, smoking or drugs.
Doctors orders.

14:36.380 --> 14:38.859
Oh.

14:38.860 --> 14:40.899
Oh, I see.

14:40.900 --> 14:43.419
Oh, I see.
Well, you can't, that's the point.

14:43.420 --> 14:46.979
Should have known better than to
rely on this family for support.

14:46.980 --> 14:50.979
Your sister made a terrible job
of bringing the three of you up.

14:54.980 --> 14:57.179
We're trying to help you.

14:57.180 --> 15:00.379
By depriving me of the very few
pleasures I have in this life(?)

15:00.380 --> 15:04.379
No fucking way.
I shall see again on my terms.

15:05.420 --> 15:06.739
Oh! Fuck...

15:06.740 --> 15:10.739
Ah! Piss off!

15:16.500 --> 15:20.499
Is it because of me,
why you're here? Cos if it is...

15:20.980 --> 15:24.979
(LAUGHS) Don't fool yourself.

15:26.220 --> 15:27.859
You seem fine to me.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.219
Why? What did you expect?

15:29.220 --> 15:32.339
Strapped to a bed, off your tits.

15:32.340 --> 15:36.339
That happens later
when you lot all fuck off home.

15:43.940 --> 15:45.779
What's new with you, Joe?

15:45.780 --> 15:48.619
The way I see it,

15:48.620 --> 15:51.699
Chatsworth's a gold mine
and no-one's taking advantage,

15:51.700 --> 15:54.539
so I'm digging in
for the long-term. >

15:54.540 --> 15:58.539
With the shop
I can undercut suppliers to other
businesses with my own stock.

16:00.420 --> 16:03.059
Everybody benefits, especially us.

16:03.060 --> 16:07.059
Starting here.

16:08.580 --> 16:12.579
I know Jamie's struggling and
there's no way he'd take it from me.

16:13.460 --> 16:16.299
Just want to help.

16:16.300 --> 16:20.299
You want to set your mind
at ease, more like.

16:21.100 --> 16:25.099
Keep it.

16:36.300 --> 16:40.299
And the husband says, "Everything!
Get the fuck out of my house!"

16:42.020 --> 16:46.019
The joke! I've remembered
the end of the joke.

16:46.380 --> 16:50.379
I'll be waiting.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.939
How's Max?

17:03.940 --> 17:07.019
It's sound.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.739
So how is she?

17:08.740 --> 17:11.939
Same as you -
just getting on with it, you know.

17:11.940 --> 17:15.898
I know it's hard for...
for both of you.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.259
It's fine, honest.

17:17.260 --> 17:21.259
When I said we'd stay mates,
I didn't expect... It's just...

17:21.940 --> 17:23.059
Awkward.

17:23.060 --> 17:26.858
Awkward.
I don't want to hate her,
but I do and I don't.

17:26.859 --> 17:28.499
That's normal. >

17:28.500 --> 17:31.219
Give it time. I reckon you two
are meant to be together,

17:31.220 --> 17:34.059
like me and Shane.

17:34.060 --> 17:38.059
a lot worse, you know.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.539
Micky, smell my finger.

17:55.540 --> 17:55.979
What's that?

17:55.980 --> 17:58.859
What's that?
Your mam!

17:58.860 --> 18:00.339
Urgh, what's that?
Smells like shit!

18:00.340 --> 18:01.699
Urgh, what's that?
Smells like shit!
Your dad!

18:01.700 --> 18:05.699
Mmmm, do you want me to tell you
what he had for his tea last night?

18:08.180 --> 18:10.499
You know he hasn't
got a dad you tosser.

18:10.500 --> 18:14.499
He's not got a...

18:16.340 --> 18:20.339
Four beers, please, Mum.

18:22.140 --> 18:23.939
LAUGHTER

18:23.940 --> 18:27.779
Didn't realise you and Billy
were so close off the pitch.

18:27.780 --> 18:29.059
Yeah. He's staying at ours.

18:29.060 --> 18:32.899
Poor bastard he's been kicked out for
selling his granddad's medication.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.579
I'm letting him get his head down
in Micky's old room

18:35.580 --> 18:37.899
till he sorts something better.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.379
Tell Billy to pop upstairs.

18:39.380 --> 18:42.099
Micky's sheets come with their own
natural starch.

18:42.100 --> 18:46.099
I've got some clean ones he can use.

18:47.340 --> 18:50.099
I told you to disappear.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.619
I tried to let you down gently.

18:52.620 --> 18:54.379
By threatening to kill me.

18:54.380 --> 18:55.979
You wouldn't kill a kid.

18:55.980 --> 18:58.499
Given a choice I wouldn't
fuck one either.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.059
You sure?

19:01.060 --> 19:03.939
Because I want more than
just a wank from now on.

19:03.940 --> 19:07.659
One word, just one word from me about
what's been going on.

19:07.660 --> 19:11.659
Police, family.
Your life won't be worth living.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.779
And I don't want that,

19:17.780 --> 19:20.819
it's like you said,
no man round here will touch you

19:20.820 --> 19:22.419
because you're Mrs Patrick Maguire.

19:22.420 --> 19:23.939
I'm the best you can hope for.

19:23.940 --> 19:26.259
What is it you want? Drugs? Money?

19:26.260 --> 19:29.659
You! Ever since we first met.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.299
Just you.

19:31.300 --> 19:35.299
Tonight, 11, round the back.

19:45.780 --> 19:46.779
What do you want me for?

19:46.780 --> 19:48.939
What do you want me for?
Little Liam, is that you?

19:48.940 --> 19:50.859
Give us your tie,
will you?

19:50.860 --> 19:53.339
I'm not throwing 3 in the pot
for the privilege

19:53.340 --> 19:57.339
of drinking in this shithole.
Is that it?

19:57.580 --> 19:59.699
He dragged you over here for that?

19:59.700 --> 20:01.419
Don't let him take the piss.

20:01.420 --> 20:04.659
I'm sorting it.
What he can't see can't harm him.

20:04.660 --> 20:05.659
Nice one.

20:05.660 --> 20:09.659
Nice one.
Tea will be ready at six.

20:11.020 --> 20:13.459
What are you gawping at, numb nuts.

20:13.460 --> 20:14.899
Carl, is that you?

20:14.900 --> 20:16.979
How did you know it was me?

20:16.980 --> 20:18.939
Who else would it be?

20:18.940 --> 20:22.939
Here fasten this tie for us,
you know I'm invalid.

20:25.900 --> 20:29.059
Never noticed it before,
but this place fucking stinks...

20:29.060 --> 20:33.059
I can distinctly smell the putrid
odour of stale beer and piss.

20:34.660 --> 20:38.659
That's you.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.419
I'm cancelling tonight,

20:41.420 --> 20:43.459
I'm not in the mood and
there's not enough staff.

20:43.460 --> 20:46.259
I can't afford to cancel,
Mam, you promised.

20:46.260 --> 20:48.619
Fine. But I'm finished
at eleven on the dot.

20:48.620 --> 20:50.379
Fine.

20:50.380 --> 20:51.459
Drink.

20:51.460 --> 20:55.459
(SHOUTS)

21:12.780 --> 21:16.779
Listen, you've no need
to hide your new man from me.

21:17.140 --> 21:20.019
I don't know what shite people
are spouting ,

21:20.020 --> 21:21.299
but I haven't got a fella,

21:21.300 --> 21:25.299
and for your information
I don't need one,
this smile's me own.

21:26.980 --> 21:29.379
Surprised she's not
beating men off with a stick.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.299
It's her legs see. Irresistible.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.779
Pins like Anne Bancroft
in her heyday.

21:33.780 --> 21:37.779
He's not a charity, Shane,
you're best leaving things as is.

21:39.380 --> 21:40.459
I can't Kell.

21:40.460 --> 21:42.579
Just focus on the deal
with Joe tomorrow.

21:42.580 --> 21:45.259
Have a look at him,
it's not easy for him.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.019
Men like me dad are a dying breed.

21:47.020 --> 21:51.019
Not interested.

21:56.220 --> 22:00.219
Fucking hell!

22:21.980 --> 22:23.419
Hickery Dickery?

22:23.420 --> 22:26.659
Fifty-to-one, Jay, dead cert.

22:26.660 --> 22:28.579
Thank me later. Sharing the wealth.

22:28.580 --> 22:32.579
Cheers mate.

22:44.260 --> 22:46.579
Jamie, we're taking Dad
out tomorrow night, all of us.

22:46.580 --> 22:48.499
Too much on here.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.459
Come on. You work too hard.

22:50.460 --> 22:51.499
You need a break.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.099
Give your mind a rest for one night.

22:53.100 --> 22:56.419
I'll get Mum to baby-sit. Me and
Micky will sort out your drinks.

22:56.420 --> 22:57.339
Well...

22:57.340 --> 23:01.339
Well...
All right. Cheers lads.

23:01.860 --> 23:05.099
I feel fucking everything.

23:05.100 --> 23:08.379
He thinks his cigs taste different
because his senses have heightened.

23:08.380 --> 23:12.379
Party carries on back at ours
if you're up for it, Carlos.

23:14.700 --> 23:18.699
Best see to him, make sure he gets
home all right.

23:24.660 --> 23:28.659
Where the shit am I?

23:29.660 --> 23:31.499
Oh, hello?

23:31.500 --> 23:35.459
Come on, I know there's someone here

23:35.460 --> 23:38.939
cos I could hear a squelching noise.

23:38.940 --> 23:42.939
Yeah come on just here,
oh, come on, just point us home.

23:48.420 --> 23:52.419
Sod you then, as you were.

23:52.780 --> 23:56.779
Roll out the barrel.

23:57.180 --> 23:58.579
What you doing down there?

23:58.580 --> 24:00.819
Er... I'm blind.

24:00.820 --> 24:04.419
Not fucking soft.
Someone at it down there.

24:04.420 --> 24:06.099
Either that or they're milking a cow.

24:06.100 --> 24:10.099
Er, that way.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.979
Oof! Oof!

24:30.980 --> 24:32.059
Help us, anyone!

24:33.060 --> 24:35.139
Eh? Come on!

24:35.140 --> 24:37.459
Oh, you poor thing, you!

24:37.460 --> 24:38.499
Oh!

24:38.500 --> 24:40.339
Let's get you cleaned up.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.579
Oh!

24:42.580 --> 24:46.179
Thanks very much, love.

24:46.180 --> 24:50.179
Ow! Ow!

24:50.780 --> 24:53.579
Clothes on spin dry,
shouldn't be long.

24:53.580 --> 24:57.579
There was a library card in your
pocket, I put it away safe for you.

24:57.820 --> 24:59.859
Oh.

24:59.860 --> 25:02.899
I think that chapter
of my life is closed.

25:02.900 --> 25:03.939
Oh.

25:03.940 --> 25:06.219
Do you miss it, seeing?

25:06.220 --> 25:08.659
I can't...
My memory's... Val...

25:08.660 --> 25:11.219
There's no point dwelling
on the past, is there?

25:11.220 --> 25:13.819
You know, you've got to move on and

25:13.820 --> 25:17.379
make the best of now.

25:17.380 --> 25:21.139
Any...man in your life?

25:21.140 --> 25:22.419
Just one.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.819
Ronald.

25:24.820 --> 25:26.659
I've put him out of my life.

25:26.660 --> 25:28.939
Just a memory now.

25:28.940 --> 25:32.939
Ooh, you are naughty
for asking, Frank!

25:33.220 --> 25:35.699
It is nice, having...

25:35.700 --> 25:39.699
A man's touch?

25:43.420 --> 25:45.019
Ooh, I couldn't take advantage.

25:45.020 --> 25:49.019
You took me in, fed me,
cleaned and undressed me

25:49.380 --> 25:53.379
when no one would care for me.

25:54.420 --> 25:58.419
It's me who's taking advantage, Val.

26:05.260 --> 26:09.139
I think we both want
the same thing, don't we?

26:09.140 --> 26:13.139
I mean, it's only natural, isn't it,
when lonely souls find each other?

26:13.820 --> 26:17.739
It has been a long time.

26:17.740 --> 26:20.579
A very, very long time.

26:20.580 --> 26:21.659
Oh!

26:21.660 --> 26:25.659
The...best...blow...job
...in...my...life!

26:28.980 --> 26:31.619
Oh! Oh!

26:31.620 --> 26:35.619
Oh! Oh!

26:52.420 --> 26:55.739
# Well, you can tell
by the way I use my walk

26:55.740 --> 26:58.419
# I'm a woman's man,
no time to talk

26:58.420 --> 27:00.659
# Music loud and women warm

27:00.660 --> 27:02.779
# I've been kicked around
since I was born

27:02.780 --> 27:06.779
# And now it's all right, it's OK
And you may look the other way

27:07.140 --> 27:09.979
# We can try to understand

27:09.980 --> 27:12.219
# The New York Times' effect on man

27:12.220 --> 27:13.979
# Whether you're a brother
or whether you're a mother

27:13.980 --> 27:16.899
# You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive

27:16.900 --> 27:19.179
# Feel the city breakin'
and everybody shakin'

27:19.180 --> 27:21.299
# And we're stayin' alive,
stayin' alive

27:21.300 --> 27:25.299
# Ah, ha, ha, ha
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

27:25.940 --> 27:29.939
# Ah, ha, ha, ha
Stayin' alive...

27:30.860 --> 27:34.859
Al Pacino.

27:46.980 --> 27:48.059
12.

27:48.060 --> 27:49.139
Hit me.

27:49.140 --> 27:50.379
16.

27:50.380 --> 27:51.899
Hit me.

27:51.900 --> 27:52.979
20.

27:52.980 --> 27:55.139
Hit me.

27:55.140 --> 27:57.739
It's about how you win, Ches!

27:57.740 --> 27:58.619
Hit me.

27:58.620 --> 27:59.779
Hit me.
Sir, you have 20.

27:59.780 --> 28:03.779
HIT me!

28:04.660 --> 28:08.659
That's how you win!

28:20.060 --> 28:22.619
It's like a sausage factory in here.

28:22.620 --> 28:24.979
Nah, it's grand.
We just need to liven things up

28:24.980 --> 28:26.379
with a game of Pull a Pig!

28:26.380 --> 28:27.059
Kelly.

28:27.060 --> 28:29.819
Kelly.
Yeah, I couldn't pull
a pig if I tried, me.

28:29.820 --> 28:32.459
I'm a magnet for model types,
I can't help it.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.219
Nah!

28:33.220 --> 28:35.979
Nah!
No. Anyway, it's misogynistic
and sexist.

28:35.980 --> 28:39.979
Extra points if you
get one with a hump!

29:03.500 --> 29:07.099
I've never seen him like this
before, he's even creeping me out.

29:07.100 --> 29:10.339
I can't believe I promised him
he'd get laid tonight.

29:10.340 --> 29:14.339
Should I have a word or summat?
I feel responsible.

29:15.740 --> 29:18.819
He's doin' me 'ead in!

29:18.820 --> 29:21.339
I think it's time
to make a move, yeah?

29:21.340 --> 29:22.779
Nonsense...

29:22.780 --> 29:26.379
I'm onto a winner over there.
Buck-eyed and hair-lipped!

29:26.380 --> 29:30.379
Yeah, well, it's just...

29:31.140 --> 29:35.139
A problem?

29:35.980 --> 29:37.579
No.

29:37.580 --> 29:41.579
Good. My round.

29:43.100 --> 29:46.259
I've got some business to sort,
I'll be back in an hour tops.

29:46.260 --> 29:50.259
Shane!

30:15.140 --> 30:18.099
Shit! Are you Benson?

30:18.100 --> 30:22.099
I'm Paddy Maguire.

30:30.540 --> 30:32.499
All night, it's had me on edge.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.219
His chips aren't adding up.

30:34.220 --> 30:38.219
He's got more than he's won,
I've kept count.

30:44.180 --> 30:46.979
If I'd known you wanted
us out to babysit Dad,

30:46.980 --> 30:48.979
I wouldn't have fuckin' bothered!

30:48.980 --> 30:50.739
I know, I'm sorry.

30:50.740 --> 30:52.579
Well, one of us should go back.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.979
No, he's probably
fucked off home by now.

30:54.980 --> 30:58.979
Yeah, and what if he hasn't?

31:05.580 --> 31:07.779
Ha ha ha!

31:07.780 --> 31:11.779
Piss it!

31:15.900 --> 31:18.059
Shit!

31:18.060 --> 31:19.859
Fraud?

31:19.860 --> 31:23.339
Fuck off! If you don't want me
taking your money,

31:23.340 --> 31:25.819
you shouldn't make it
so easy, pal. Whoa!

31:25.820 --> 31:27.979
I tell you what, I tell you what,
I tell you what...

31:27.980 --> 31:30.059
If I roll a seven, I'll leave.

31:30.060 --> 31:33.659
If I roll an eight, I'll stay.

31:33.660 --> 31:37.659
Come on...

31:54.380 --> 31:58.379
(SCREAMS)

32:23.460 --> 32:27.459
Are you on your own? >

32:27.500 --> 32:31.499
Thought so!

32:57.740 --> 32:58.899
Shane with you?

32:58.900 --> 33:02.899
Ugh...

33:03.820 --> 33:07.019
I knew this night were
a write off from the start.

33:07.020 --> 33:08.739
You've got issues, Paddy,

33:08.740 --> 33:10.699
and a night on the tiles
ain't going to solve 'em.

33:10.700 --> 33:12.499
and a night on the tiles
ain't going to solve 'em.
What the fuck would you know?!

33:12.500 --> 33:14.259
I come across men like you every day.

33:14.260 --> 33:18.259
Shaving their balls and trading in
the people carrier for a convertible.

33:18.460 --> 33:19.939
Well, they also realise,

33:19.940 --> 33:23.939
there's no such thing as feeling as
young as the person you're poking!

33:24.420 --> 33:28.419
And your lot, treating you like
you're something different,

33:29.660 --> 33:33.659
I'm sick of it!

33:35.820 --> 33:39.819
Do you know what I'm sick of?

33:49.700 --> 33:51.899
Shane made me a promise tonight.

33:51.900 --> 33:55.899
Didn't deliver.

33:57.540 --> 34:01.539
Can't have that, can we?

34:04.700 --> 34:05.699
I clocked off an hour ago.

34:05.700 --> 34:09.699
Clock back on.

34:25.100 --> 34:29.099
Wash your cock in the sink
and throw on a condom.

34:30.980 --> 34:34.899
# Well, I've long since retired,
my son's moved away

34:34.900 --> 34:38.699
# I called him up just the other day

34:38.699 --> 34:42.498
# I said, I'd like to see you,
if you don't mind

34:42.500 --> 34:46.498
# He said, I'd love to, Dad,
if I can find the time

34:46.940 --> 34:49.699
# You see, my new job's a hassle
and the kids have the flu

34:49.699 --> 34:52.539
# But it's sure nice
talking to you, Dad

34:52.540 --> 34:56.539
# It's been sure nice talking to you

34:57.460 --> 35:01.019
# And as he hung up the phone,
it occurred to me

35:01.020 --> 35:05.019
# He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

35:09.020 --> 35:12.419
# And the cat's in the cradle
and the silver spoon... #

35:12.420 --> 35:15.699
This were just a job for me.

35:15.700 --> 35:16.339
What's your excuse?

35:16.340 --> 35:17.779
What's your excuse?
PHONE RINGS

35:17.780 --> 35:20.259
# ..When ya comin' home, son?
I don't know when,

35:20.260 --> 35:24.259
# We'll get together then, Dad

35:24.380 --> 35:28.379
# We're gonna have
a good time then. #

35:34.010 --> 35:38.009
Liam. Membership of club Blunkett
has expired, son!

35:38.890 --> 35:41.929
Look at that! I am glowing!

35:41.930 --> 35:45.129
I'm actually glowing!

35:45.130 --> 35:48.729
Told you I'd cure myself, didn't I?
My way, like I always have.

35:48.730 --> 35:51.969
You didn't do anything.
We swapped your vices for virtues.

35:51.970 --> 35:54.209
We swapped your lager
for non-alcoholic,

35:54.210 --> 35:55.769
your cigarettes for herbals,

35:55.770 --> 35:58.129
and you've been popping paracetamol
not Es.

35:58.130 --> 36:01.369
You've been getting drunk -
it's called the placebo effect.

36:01.370 --> 36:04.929
Feel good did it? Stamping
all over your father's pride?

36:04.930 --> 36:06.849
Laughing at me behind me back?

36:06.850 --> 36:09.249
"Oh, ha-ha
look at Dad tripping on Anadin!"

36:09.250 --> 36:13.249
You know it's been
a real eye opener, this.

36:13.970 --> 36:17.289
Abused by my own blood.

36:17.290 --> 36:20.809
Treated as a third-class citizen
in me own house.

36:20.810 --> 36:23.449
I was a very sick man, son.

36:23.450 --> 36:25.369
I needed respect...

36:25.370 --> 36:27.409
compassion...

36:27.410 --> 36:31.409
delicate handling.

36:31.690 --> 36:35.289
Actually, you know it's good
that the truth has come out,

36:35.290 --> 36:39.289
because it makes what
I'm about to say ten times easier.

36:39.650 --> 36:40.689
I'm off.

36:40.690 --> 36:44.289
You are on your own from now on.

36:44.290 --> 36:47.689
I've met someone and she cares.

36:47.690 --> 36:51.129
We care! That's why we did it.

36:51.130 --> 36:55.129
We love ya.

36:56.330 --> 36:58.369
Yeah, well...

36:58.370 --> 37:02.369
Hitler loved fuckin' eugenics.
Don't make it right, does it?

37:03.370 --> 37:07.369
DOOR SLAMS

37:15.290 --> 37:18.649
Frankie.

37:18.650 --> 37:22.649
Ronald?

37:24.130 --> 37:27.369
Different name...same old shop.

37:27.370 --> 37:29.369
As long as I break even, I'm happy.

37:29.370 --> 37:32.409
It's enough to get me by and
then I can live off my winnings.

37:32.410 --> 37:36.409
Winnings? You're barred from every
casino and bookie in Manchester.

37:39.890 --> 37:42.609
Next person round that corner -
woman.

37:42.610 --> 37:44.489
Man.

37:44.490 --> 37:45.769
Ah! Pay up.

37:45.770 --> 37:46.769
Void bet, it's Lillian.

37:46.770 --> 37:48.489
Void bet, it's Lillian.
(THEY LAUGH)

37:48.490 --> 37:49.529
Fuck off!

37:49.530 --> 37:52.049
SPLASHING

37:52.050 --> 37:55.929
DOOR SHUTS

37:55.930 --> 37:58.129
Shane.

37:58.130 --> 38:02.129
Don't worry,
I'm not about to tell him.

38:02.810 --> 38:06.809
As far as I care, you're just
another sad twat who pays for sex.

38:06.890 --> 38:10.889
(WHISPERS)
'Cept I'm your sweetheart's da.

38:15.650 --> 38:18.089
Shane is worth ten of...

38:18.090 --> 38:19.969
What?

38:19.970 --> 38:23.969
Me or you?

38:24.570 --> 38:26.289
Both.

38:26.290 --> 38:27.969
'Tough shit on the fuck up, Joe.'

38:27.970 --> 38:31.449
But I played my end - 60%.

38:31.450 --> 38:33.209
Never let it be said Joe Pritchard

38:33.210 --> 38:36.369
didn't keep his part of the deal,
even if he is out of pocket.

38:36.370 --> 38:38.809
Oh, cheer up, Joe.

38:38.810 --> 38:42.329
Arrested, tagged
and skint all in 24 hours?

38:42.330 --> 38:46.329
You're proper one of us now.

38:50.490 --> 38:52.449
Compliments of Joe.

38:52.450 --> 38:53.529
Shane.

38:53.530 --> 38:56.529
A bit of everything goes
in the pot, Kel - it always has.

38:56.530 --> 39:00.529
It wasn't Maguire money! It was
for a savings on our own place.

39:00.850 --> 39:04.849
She's right. Anything you make
off your own bat is yours.

39:05.770 --> 39:08.369
Add it to your nest egg.

39:08.370 --> 39:12.369
Oh...deja vu.

39:14.490 --> 39:18.489
Time of the month, babe.

39:23.850 --> 39:26.129
Getting loads of young ones
in here lately,

39:26.130 --> 39:30.129
don't know what the attraction is.

39:30.930 --> 39:34.249
Not complaining though. Hey,

39:34.250 --> 39:37.289
do us a favour? Watch the bar
while I check on Connor?

39:37.290 --> 39:40.889
OK, man.

39:40.890 --> 39:42.329
Something funny?

39:42.330 --> 39:45.169
Three pints and a...
When you're ready.

39:45.170 --> 39:46.569
What, a milkshake?

39:46.570 --> 39:48.249
I meant I'll have a wank.

39:48.250 --> 39:49.409
I know what you meant.

39:49.410 --> 39:51.209
Billy's told us everything.

39:51.210 --> 39:53.809
We've got money.

39:53.810 --> 39:57.809
One more word out of you, smart arse,

39:57.930 --> 40:01.249
and you'll be picking glass out
your face for the next two weeks.

40:01.250 --> 40:03.329
What the fuck you doing?
They're kids.

40:03.330 --> 40:07.289
Billy is a lying piece of shit

40:07.290 --> 40:10.809
and not to be trusted. Do you hear?

40:10.810 --> 40:14.809
Sorry.

40:15.490 --> 40:18.969
And that's what happens
if I catch anyone underage...

40:18.970 --> 40:21.969
drinking in here!

40:21.970 --> 40:25.969
This isn't a fucking youth club.

40:26.330 --> 40:29.769
# And here's to you, Mrs Robinson

40:29.770 --> 40:33.009
# Jesus loves you more
than you will know... #

40:33.010 --> 40:36.489
You were out of order back there.
And all those kids weren't lying.

40:36.490 --> 40:38.409
Mind your own fucking business.

40:38.410 --> 40:41.729
I saw you with Billy.
Sort your head out, Mimi.

40:41.730 --> 40:44.329
# Heaven holds a place
for those who pray... #

40:44.330 --> 40:48.329
Carl!

40:48.570 --> 40:49.969
'You really didn't know?'

40:49.970 --> 40:52.489
On me babies' lives.

40:52.490 --> 40:56.209
So what you going to do?

40:56.210 --> 40:57.529
Get rid of him.

40:57.530 --> 41:01.329
Fuck, that's a bit drastic,
isn't it? It was only a wank.

41:01.330 --> 41:03.609
What do you take me for, Carl?!

41:03.610 --> 41:06.329
I mean sending him on a holiday.
Permanently.

41:06.330 --> 41:09.489
He's always banging on
about some auntie in Billericay.

41:09.490 --> 41:10.929
So how you going to do that?

41:10.930 --> 41:14.729
Spread a rumour, then you're
going to chase him outta town.

41:14.730 --> 41:17.329
And if that doesn't send
the bastard packing...

41:17.330 --> 41:18.609
Plan B.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.169
Mam! >

41:21.170 --> 41:23.249
Could do with some help.

41:23.250 --> 41:27.249
Just telling Carl the good news.
He's our new star striker!

41:35.890 --> 41:38.849
# Is it a kind of dream? #

41:38.850 --> 41:42.449
SNIFFLING

41:42.450 --> 41:46.009
# Floating out on the tide... #

41:46.010 --> 41:49.129
DOOR OPENS

41:49.130 --> 41:50.529
Oh, what have I done?

41:50.530 --> 41:54.529
Look I understand
why you did what you did, son...

41:56.690 --> 41:58.689
You wanted your dad back.

41:58.690 --> 42:00.809
The house has gone to shit
without me.

42:00.810 --> 42:04.809
# There's a fog along the horizon

42:06.450 --> 42:10.449
# A strange glow in the sky... #

42:10.810 --> 42:14.809
I'm sorry, Dad.

42:17.210 --> 42:20.009
I promise I'll always
be here for you.

42:20.010 --> 42:24.009
For as long as I'm collecting
your benefits.

42:24.610 --> 42:28.609
Now, come on, dry your eyes.

42:31.330 --> 42:34.169
Things didn't work out
with your new girlfriend?

42:34.170 --> 42:37.609
Oh.

42:37.610 --> 42:40.449
When it came down to it...

42:40.450 --> 42:44.449
I couldn't leave you.

43:48.290 --> 43:51.009
Kel! >

43:51.010 --> 43:53.329
Dad's given us his room.

43:53.330 --> 43:54.409
There's more space.

43:54.410 --> 43:56.929
You need it more than I do.

43:56.930 --> 43:58.929
I'm making some changes.

43:58.930 --> 44:02.929
Wasn't there something else?

44:04.650 --> 44:05.849
Kel?

44:05.850 --> 44:09.849
You heard about Billy?

44:13.190 --> 44:15.429
It's all over the estate
that I'm a kiddy-fiddler!

44:15.430 --> 44:16.789
I know. I started it.

44:16.790 --> 44:19.709
All it took was one quick word
on the rumour mill

44:19.710 --> 44:23.349
and bingo, you're about as popular
as an immigrant at a BNP rally.

44:23.350 --> 44:24.389
For your own good.

44:24.390 --> 44:28.389
I've been chased home from school,
fucking battered...because of you!

44:30.510 --> 44:32.629
Tell me about it, stud.

44:32.630 --> 44:35.669
I'll go to the police.
I'll tell them the real truth.

44:35.670 --> 44:39.189
Be my guest. The police are probably
out there now looking for you.

44:39.190 --> 44:42.189
I phoned your auntie and explained

44:42.190 --> 44:44.709
you were having a bit of trouble
with the locals.

44:44.710 --> 44:45.909
She'd be glad to have ya.

44:45.910 --> 44:49.589
No! I love you.

44:49.590 --> 44:52.869
That's what I thought.
Then I realised it's not me you love.

44:52.870 --> 44:53.829
I love you.

44:53.830 --> 44:54.909
I love you.
You miss your mum.

44:54.910 --> 44:55.589
I want you.

44:55.590 --> 44:58.149
I want you.
I'm not your mother!

44:58.150 --> 45:02.149
A one-way ticket and
a few quid to see you through.

45:03.990 --> 45:06.909
One thing they love here
is a fucking good witch hunt.

45:06.910 --> 45:09.149
You're a lamb to the slaughter
if you stay.

45:09.150 --> 45:12.629
No! You're going to sort it.
Everything you've done to me...

45:12.630 --> 45:15.269
Do you even give a shit
what you've put me through?

45:15.270 --> 45:17.989
I haven't put in years
of hard graft raising a family

45:17.990 --> 45:19.829
so you can come along and fuck it up!

45:19.830 --> 45:23.349
Your family's a gang of
fucking thieves and freaks.

45:23.350 --> 45:25.869
They don't deserve you!

45:25.870 --> 45:27.509
This is your last warning.

45:27.510 --> 45:31.509
NO!

45:38.630 --> 45:42.309
Calm down. You were right.

45:42.310 --> 45:46.309
I could never kill a kid.

45:50.350 --> 45:54.349
Not a defenceless one, anyway.

45:58.710 --> 46:02.429
Self defence, Your Honour.

46:02.430 --> 46:04.109
Don't worry,

46:04.110 --> 46:08.109
I'll make sure you're buried
with your slag of a mother.

46:13.110 --> 46:17.109
(SOBS)

46:29.390 --> 46:33.389
GUN CLICKS

46:37.630 --> 46:40.909
Being dead has a funny way of
putting life in to perspective.

46:40.910 --> 46:43.909
It makes you appreciate
everything you had.

46:43.910 --> 46:47.909
Everyone you left behind.
But before you know it,

46:48.350 --> 46:49.629
you're six feet under,

46:49.630 --> 46:53.309
and it's too late
when you finally realise, "Fuck!

46:53.310 --> 46:57.309
"Everything I thought I needed
to be happy was all an illusion.

46:58.190 --> 47:00.709
DISTANT SHOUTS

47:00.710 --> 47:04.709
"I was always happy."

47:09.350 --> 47:13.349
Good job he shot me first -
my gun had real bullets in it.

47:18.950 --> 47:21.069
Ladies' toilets. Two minutes.

47:21.070 --> 47:23.669
One hour's work, and you get this.

47:23.670 --> 47:27.189
I've bills to pay. I don't
want to become a fucking man whore.

47:27.190 --> 47:29.949
I thought when Lillian left
I could do things my way.

47:29.950 --> 47:31.109
Number 64. You're up.

47:31.110 --> 47:35.109
After-school specials?
You're a genius.

47:35.350 --> 47:36.709
I've to pretend to be her boyfriend.

47:36.710 --> 47:38.509
I've to pretend to be her boyfriend.
Boyfriend?Ta-ra!

47:38.510 --> 47:39.549
You saw us.

47:39.550 --> 47:42.029
To fucking right I did.
Ruined me dinner!

47:42.030 --> 47:44.109
I'm having a tough time
at the moment.

47:44.110 --> 47:46.229
Could be worse, could be a poof.

47:46.230 --> 47:50.229
You can't like her.
She doesn't have a cock!
