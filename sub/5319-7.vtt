Oh, my God, Josh.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.150
Oh, my God, Josh.

01:03.770 --> 01:05.920
Don't stop.

02:47.970 --> 02:50.420
- Here you go. Uh-huh.
- Thanks, man.

03:06.260 --> 03:07.940
Aw.

03:09.260 --> 03:11.810
Oh, who's this?

03:14.100 --> 03:15.450
Getting kisses, huh? Oh!

03:15.500 --> 03:17.580
- His name is Pork.
- Oh, yeah.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.320
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

03:19.370 --> 03:20.920
Oh...

03:22.740 --> 03:23.990
What kind is it?

03:24.040 --> 03:26.390
Good morning.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.160
Good morning, sister.

03:28.210 --> 03:30.100
- Welcome, welcome.
- Thanks.

03:30.150 --> 03:32.300
Good morning, sister, welcome!

03:32.350 --> 03:34.000
Thank you.

03:55.410 --> 03:56.890
You got it.

03:56.940 --> 03:58.960
- Brother Pernell.
- Brother Paul.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.270
As always, we are eternally
grateful for your support.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.130
I just want you to know
how much I appreciate

04:07.180 --> 04:09.270
what Hand of God has
done for me and my family.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.340
I am but a vessel, but thank you.

04:11.390 --> 04:12.970
Have I introduced you to Eli?

04:13.020 --> 04:15.110
He's the genius behind our social media.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.110
- Hello, Eli.
- Hi.

05:02.570 --> 05:05.160
Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.930
Morning.

05:11.980 --> 05:13.530
How are you?

05:13.580 --> 05:16.040
I'm blessed. And you?

05:16.990 --> 05:19.040
More than I deserve.

05:21.430 --> 05:24.010
One, two, three, four.

05:24.060 --> 05:26.810
Stand up if you're ready to sing for Jesus!

05:26.860 --> 05:28.150
Hallelujah.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.050
Everybody sing with me!

05:33.900 --> 05:36.790
â™ª Oh, boy â™ª

05:36.840 --> 05:40.760
â™ª What have you done â™ª

05:40.810 --> 05:42.400
â™ª Done to my heart â™ª

05:42.450 --> 05:45.200
â™ª You're hearing what you want â™ª

05:45.250 --> 05:49.740
â™ª So you can't see what's right in your face â™ª

05:51.790 --> 05:55.280
â™ª Just like a child â™ª

05:55.330 --> 05:57.410
â™ª You'll get your way â™ª

05:57.460 --> 05:59.650
â™ª What can I tell you â™ª

05:59.700 --> 06:01.150
Keep singing!

06:01.200 --> 06:04.650
â™ª What can I say to make you see â™ª

06:04.700 --> 06:08.360
- â™ª Do what you want to do â™ª
- â™ª Do what you want to do â™ª

06:08.410 --> 06:12.190
â™ª Say what you're gonna say â™ª

06:12.240 --> 06:15.630
â™ª How can you turn away â™ª

06:15.680 --> 06:17.460
â™ª When all I do is â™ª

06:17.510 --> 06:18.770
So?

06:18.820 --> 06:21.200
Soon.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.170
Just getting a feel for him.

06:24.220 --> 06:26.410
Figuring the right time, right place.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.140
Good.

06:28.190 --> 06:30.340
I don't want Jocelyn anywhere near it.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.180
I don't like watching him be nice to her.

06:35.230 --> 06:37.880
- Smiling at her...
- How do you think I feel?

06:37.930 --> 06:40.420
He and PJ were like brothers.

06:40.470 --> 06:43.120
There were summers he
basically lived at our house.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.030
And he made PJ sit there and watch

06:45.080 --> 06:46.760
while Shane rapes his wife.

06:50.310 --> 06:53.570
Cops say the first place you
go looking is in the family.

06:55.720 --> 06:58.040
I think she likes him.

06:58.090 --> 07:00.240
And that makes me mad.

07:00.290 --> 07:02.380
I want to fix that.

07:04.830 --> 07:07.210
Don't rush it, Keith.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.580
We can't afford to have
problems like we did with Shane.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.150
No, I learned from that. Don't worry.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.590
I do worry.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.390
You called me twice while
you were watching him.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.830
Twice.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.790
Do you know how many
people I sent to the chair

07:20.840 --> 07:22.660
because of a fucking cell phone?

07:22.710 --> 07:23.900
More than a few.

07:23.950 --> 07:25.770
I, uh, I won't call you.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.230
You don't call anyone.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.170
In fact, turn the whole fucking thing off.

07:29.220 --> 07:31.310
We don't talk until this thing is done.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.470
You got that? We do not speak.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.310
I got it.

07:36.830 --> 07:38.180
Keith...

07:41.130 --> 07:42.550
I'm proud of you.

07:42.600 --> 07:47.190
I want you with me after PJ wakes up.

07:47.240 --> 07:50.090
But I need this clean and smart.

07:50.140 --> 07:51.890
Understand?

07:51.940 --> 07:54.300
I can do that.

08:02.150 --> 08:05.710
You know, my mom had a rule: I
wasn't allowed to hate people.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.140
I mean, I was allowed to hate
things like... like broccoli

08:08.190 --> 08:09.940
or... or Nickelback, things like that.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.350
But I wasn't allowed to
waste my energy hating people.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.720
Is that Buddhist or something?

08:14.770 --> 08:17.020
Maybe. Or Oprah.

08:17.070 --> 08:19.890
I was doing a pretty good job
following that rule, really.

08:19.940 --> 08:22.360
But Pernell Harris is making it really,

08:22.410 --> 08:24.330
really hard for me right now.

08:24.380 --> 08:25.990
I mean, I'm trying to
have my head in a place

08:26.040 --> 08:28.130
where I can pick the right
poem for tonight, and it just...

08:28.180 --> 08:30.230
So you are going to the reading?

08:30.280 --> 08:31.970
Would you be okay if I don't?

08:32.020 --> 08:34.970
I don't know, Josh, I'm kind
of in the middle of a tirade.

08:35.020 --> 08:36.970
You want to know why?

08:37.020 --> 08:39.140
You just told me... Pernell.

08:39.190 --> 08:41.280
No, no, that's who, that's not why.

08:41.330 --> 08:42.909
Now he's trying to get the investigation

08:42.960 --> 08:44.580
into PJ's suicide reopened.

08:44.630 --> 08:46.350
- What the fuck?
- I know. Read it.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.550
Can he do that? Did you talk to Nick?

08:48.600 --> 08:52.390
Mm-hmm. It's a stalling tactic.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.660
That Pernell is desperate
to keep PJ on life support,

08:54.710 --> 08:56.460
because he knows he's about
to lose the court case.

08:56.510 --> 08:59.460
So Nick can't do something?

08:59.510 --> 09:00.890
Mm-mm.

09:00.940 --> 09:06.330
The Honorable Judge Harris
found a technicality.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.930
There were no witnesses or suicide note,

09:07.980 --> 09:09.800
so they have to at least
go through the motions.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.000
Wait, wait...

09:11.050 --> 09:12.070
That could take at least two weeks.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.740
No suicide note?

09:15.790 --> 09:18.310
I never told them about the note.

09:18.360 --> 09:22.250
Do you still have it?

09:22.300 --> 09:23.620
So tell them now!

09:23.670 --> 09:26.520
No.

09:26.570 --> 09:28.190
No, that's between me and PJ.

09:28.240 --> 09:33.230
Okay... this might sound a little
harsh, but that's ridiculous.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.200
I know you don't want to,

09:35.250 --> 09:36.960
and I know it's going to be hard for you,

09:37.010 --> 09:37.960
but just show the cops the note.

09:38.010 --> 09:38.970
Let's get this over with.

09:39.020 --> 09:40.830
I said no.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.700
As far as I'm concerned, that
note does not exist, okay?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.210
That's it.

09:46.260 --> 09:48.440
But you still have it,

09:48.490 --> 09:50.440
so that can't be it.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.640
You there yet?

10:21.690 --> 10:25.510
- Yeah, I'm there.
- Good.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.810
You need to look at this.

10:52.020 --> 10:55.440
Thank you.

10:55.490 --> 10:58.010
Aren't you gonna say anything?

10:58.060 --> 10:59.810
What do you want me to say?

10:59.860 --> 11:03.080
Shit, I don't know, but say something.

11:05.870 --> 11:10.720
It's not like I thought
he was 100% faithful.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.030
I knew he dallied time to time.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.060
Shit, I have my fun.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.530
But we were always respectful.

11:19.580 --> 11:22.300
This is... this is... this is unbelievable.

11:22.350 --> 11:24.070
Man, let that shit out.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.610
I just did.

11:25.660 --> 11:28.710
You said, "Unbelievable."

11:28.760 --> 11:30.780
That's uptight WASP letting it out.

11:30.830 --> 11:34.110
You need to let that shit
out like and Italian woman.

11:34.160 --> 11:38.320
Like a trailer trash
girl. Let that shit out.

11:38.370 --> 11:40.050
He's a fucking asshole.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.320
There you go.

11:41.370 --> 11:43.020
He's a motherfucking bigamist.

11:43.070 --> 11:46.430
He's fucking bigamist
asshole piece of shit!

11:46.480 --> 11:48.400
- Yes, yes.
- That's what he is!

11:48.450 --> 11:50.030
I'm gonna kill him, I'm
gonna kill him, April.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.070
I'm gonna stab him in his sleep

11:52.120 --> 11:53.430
with a fucking knife to the neck!

11:53.480 --> 11:55.970
Whoa, too far, too Italian.

11:56.020 --> 11:58.000
It's either that or move
out, because otherwise,

11:58.050 --> 12:00.210
if I am around him, if
I see that motherfucker,

12:00.260 --> 12:01.510
I'm gonna kill him.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.510
Well, give yourself some space, then.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.910
Get a nice room with a well stocked bar

12:05.960 --> 12:07.480
and a well hung man.

12:07.530 --> 12:10.920
You know what I need?

12:10.970 --> 12:13.190
I need to know why.

12:13.240 --> 12:17.620
You think Pernell could ever
really answer that question?

12:22.910 --> 12:26.400
"When justice is done, it
brings joy to the righteous

12:26.450 --> 12:30.640
but terror to evildoers."

12:30.690 --> 12:33.940
That's God talking, son.

12:33.990 --> 12:36.910
And Josh is gonna feel that terror.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.280
I promise.

12:39.330 --> 12:41.480
We did it.

12:49.570 --> 12:54.060
You're going to wake up...

12:54.110 --> 12:58.000
and we're gonna start all over again.

13:00.650 --> 13:03.700
And I'm gonna make up for everything.

13:06.060 --> 13:09.610
I'm only sorry it took so long.

13:16.470 --> 13:19.950
I love you.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.600
I don't think those windows open.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.480
You're not supposed to be in
here, you know that, right?

13:42.530 --> 13:46.010
Yeah, I heard after what happened last week

13:46.060 --> 13:49.680
they're only letting immediate family in.

13:49.730 --> 13:52.350
Jocelyn got 'em to make
an exception for me.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.190
Well, that makes sense.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.120
I mean, after all, you are his best friend.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.120
Hmm.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.330
Must have been hard

13:59.380 --> 14:01.660
staying friends with him, though, right?

14:01.710 --> 14:03.530
I mean, after what he did to you?

14:03.580 --> 14:04.900
What he did to me?

14:04.950 --> 14:07.470
You know, refusing to sell
the Bath Water program?

14:07.520 --> 14:11.510
That's what split up
the business, wasn't it?

14:11.560 --> 14:13.140
I got over it.

14:13.190 --> 14:15.040
Really?

14:15.090 --> 14:20.380
How much would you have made if
PJ decided to sell the business?

14:20.430 --> 14:22.620
It's hard to say when you're
talking about dot-com money.

14:22.670 --> 14:25.490
Millions? I mean, at
least a million, right?

14:25.540 --> 14:27.120
- Yeah, at least a million.
- Wow.

14:27.170 --> 14:31.990
That is a lot of money to
lose and still stay friends.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.360
I don't know.

14:33.410 --> 14:35.960
How much money would you pay
to have more time with PJ?

14:44.820 --> 14:46.510
Let me ask you something else.

14:46.560 --> 14:50.680
I'm gonna go way back now, but...

14:50.730 --> 14:56.050
didn't you and PJ both
have a thing for Jocelyn?

14:56.100 --> 14:57.850
You did, right?

14:57.900 --> 14:59.790
Yeah, PJ told me you did.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.390
I had a crush. It was never a thing.

15:03.440 --> 15:08.090
Yeah, but if PJ was gone
and Jocelyn got to decide

15:08.140 --> 15:10.530
what happens with the Bath Water program,

15:10.580 --> 15:12.570
having "a thing" now

15:12.620 --> 15:14.570
would be real convenient for you,

15:14.620 --> 15:15.900
wouldn't it?

15:15.950 --> 15:18.240
That's not what I'm trying to do.

15:18.290 --> 15:21.170
You got her staying at
your apartment, don't you?

15:21.220 --> 15:22.780
As a friend.

15:22.830 --> 15:24.950
Right.

15:26.830 --> 15:30.680
So which apartment do you
have her in, the one on Cedar?

15:30.730 --> 15:33.550
Or the one at Eastwood?

15:33.600 --> 15:37.120
Yeah. I know about Eastwood.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.990
I know everything.

15:41.010 --> 15:45.670
And what you should know is...

15:45.720 --> 15:48.900
you're not getting away with it.

15:48.950 --> 15:51.200
I hope you don't mean
you're going to tell Jocelyn.

15:51.250 --> 15:55.010
Oh, that should be the
least of your worries.

15:55.060 --> 15:57.680
What the fuck? Do you hate her?

15:57.730 --> 15:59.050
You keep heaping shit on her.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.280
You don't think she's been through enough?

16:00.330 --> 16:02.320
Because of you.

16:02.370 --> 16:04.590
What was I supposed to do?

16:04.640 --> 16:06.590
He begged me to rent that place.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.250
I couldn't say no.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.060
Who begged you?

16:11.110 --> 16:13.890
Wait, I thought you
said you knew everything.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.130
PJ.

16:16.180 --> 16:19.270
Why would PJ beg you to
rent an apartment for him?

16:19.320 --> 16:23.270
He was having an affair!

16:23.320 --> 16:25.040
You're lying.

16:25.090 --> 16:26.910
He didn't want Jocelyn to find out.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.210
You know what, neither did I,

16:28.260 --> 16:32.280
so I rented an apartment
for him under my name.

16:32.330 --> 16:33.750
You're fucking lying.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.220
Why would I lie, Mr. Harris?

16:35.270 --> 16:36.820
I could show you cancelled checks from PJ

16:36.870 --> 16:38.080
for six months worth of rent.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.790
I never even saw the inside of that place.

16:50.980 --> 16:52.670
Sir, that phone's for employees only.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.170
This is an emergency.

16:54.220 --> 16:55.300
This is KD.

16:55.350 --> 16:59.010
Leave a message, and have a blessed day.

17:08.900 --> 17:11.079
- Brother Pernell?
- Have you seen Keith?

17:11.130 --> 17:13.690
KD? No. Not since the service.

17:13.740 --> 17:15.790
Call him. Call him right now.

17:15.839 --> 17:17.290
Everything okay?

17:17.339 --> 17:20.890
Look, I'm sorry, I really
need to speak to Keith.

17:20.940 --> 17:24.030
But wouldn't you know it, my
cell phone is out of juice.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.130
Would you like to use mine?

17:26.180 --> 17:28.099
Can I?

17:33.520 --> 17:35.210
- This is KD.
- Fuck.

17:35.260 --> 17:37.680
Leave a message, and have a blessed day.

17:38.830 --> 17:40.250
Keith, it's me.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.880
Look, don't do anything
till you talk to me.

17:42.930 --> 17:45.250
Call Alicia back the minute you get this.

17:45.300 --> 17:48.020
Shit!

17:48.070 --> 17:50.520
I need for you to call
me as soon as Keith calls.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.360
You got that?

17:52.410 --> 17:53.790
Yeah.

18:23.970 --> 18:27.090
The fuck-up of the week goes to Kugler.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.460
Now, I know you're new to this game,

18:28.510 --> 18:30.400
but when a reporter calls to speak with me

18:30.450 --> 18:33.500
and I'm taking a shit, you
say, "The mayor's in a meeting."

18:33.550 --> 18:35.870
You do not say, "The
mayor can't talk right now

18:35.920 --> 18:37.240
because he's taking a shit."

18:37.290 --> 18:39.170
I didn't say you were taking a shit.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.780
I said you were in the restroom,
and I said you'd be right out.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.580
I don't think that implies taking a shit.

18:43.630 --> 18:45.080
I don't think they need to envision

18:45.130 --> 18:46.910
me taking a shit or a piss.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.350
"In a meeting" works just fine.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.290
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, Mayor Boston, I...

18:52.340 --> 18:54.320
Please, for job security, stop talking.

18:54.370 --> 18:56.220
Next, Asa, I want to find out...

18:56.270 --> 18:57.860
Mayor Boston.

19:02.880 --> 19:06.030
Ladies and gentlemen, out, out.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.970
Quickly, thank you.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.240
Who's Theresa Marie Graham?

19:15.290 --> 19:18.440
Theresa Marie Graham, I don't
know who Theresa Marie...

19:18.490 --> 19:20.350
Tessie.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.790
Who's Tessie, Bobo?

19:25.840 --> 19:26.890
She's no one.

19:26.940 --> 19:28.590
- I'm serious.
- Robert...

19:28.640 --> 19:29.920
Crystal, I say this as your friend,

19:29.970 --> 19:31.120
she's no one that you need to worry...

19:31.170 --> 19:33.330
He married her. Pernell married her.

19:33.380 --> 19:36.960
That is not no one.

19:37.010 --> 19:40.570
How'd you get this?

19:40.620 --> 19:44.070
Oh, my God, you knew.

19:44.120 --> 19:47.670
You fucking knew, and you said nothing.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.640
I didn't want to put something
like that in your face.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.110
I was trying to fix it.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.010
You know, help Pernell
glue it all back together

19:53.060 --> 19:54.010
before Mommy got home.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.850
I'm not your mommy.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.450
And he didn't break a vase.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.850
I know it's more serious than that,

19:58.900 --> 20:00.690
but, I mean, look at the paper.

20:00.740 --> 20:01.960
It's like a photocopy,

20:02.010 --> 20:03.860
with a Hand of God stamp, seriously?

20:03.910 --> 20:06.130
He might not have filed
this with the county clerk,

20:06.180 --> 20:07.190
but this is a marriage certificate,

20:07.240 --> 20:09.360
that is his goddamn signature,

20:09.410 --> 20:11.400
and I have a sister wife now, you get it?

20:11.450 --> 20:15.340
And somebody thinks this
is blackmail material.

20:23.060 --> 20:24.140
What did Pernell say?

20:24.190 --> 20:26.480
I haven't gotten to him yet.

20:36.010 --> 20:39.060
So who is this...

20:39.110 --> 20:42.900
Theresa, Tessie, whatever?

20:45.280 --> 20:48.770
She and Pernell have a...
a business arrangement.

20:48.820 --> 20:52.770
So she's a whore.

20:52.820 --> 20:53.970
She's a businesswoman.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.640
Whose business is dick-sucking.

20:56.690 --> 21:00.010
Unbelievable.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.650
If this gets out...

21:01.700 --> 21:03.780
Hey, it's not gonna get leaked.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.950
All right, don't worry about that.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.390
You take care of you.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.490
We'll figure out who's
trying to take a bite

21:09.540 --> 21:10.920
and make sure they don't.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.530
The Bobo business.

21:14.580 --> 21:16.530
Can you get Pernell on the phone, please?

21:16.580 --> 21:18.900
It's ringing.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.540
Pick up. Pick up, pick up, you fuck.

21:36.700 --> 21:37.920
Hello?

21:37.970 --> 21:39.120
- Josh!
- Ha, just kidding.

21:39.170 --> 21:40.390
I'm not in right now.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.390
Give me a reason to call you back.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.390
Shit.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.130
Please, Jesus, let him be alive.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.030
Bishop, I can't tell you
how grateful we are that

21:51.080 --> 21:53.530
you would come back and
consider us for a slot.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.940
Sister Alicia and I
are just so, so honored.

21:56.990 --> 22:00.110
Well, when I buy a car,

22:00.160 --> 22:01.570
I like to kick the tires.

22:03.390 --> 22:07.080
Now, if I'm gonna consider you
to take over the 10:00 p.m. slot

22:07.130 --> 22:08.580
for my "One in the Savior" Flock-Block,

22:08.630 --> 22:11.480
I got to make sure that you're ready.

22:11.530 --> 22:14.050
Now...

22:14.100 --> 22:16.590
I see that you've got the smile.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.460
But will you have the guile
when the lights come on?

22:19.510 --> 22:22.700
I don't crack under pressure, Bishop.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.360
I perform.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.330
Hmm.

22:30.220 --> 22:33.470
Well, go ahead and preach, son.

22:48.370 --> 22:50.360
I will bless the Lord at all times,

22:50.410 --> 22:53.230
and His praise shall
continually be in my mouth.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.730
If you're gonna use your hands,

22:54.780 --> 22:56.360
use it like you're trying
to bring somebody to Jesus,

22:56.410 --> 22:59.700
not like you're begging for money.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.470
I will bless the Lord at all times,

23:01.520 --> 23:04.840
and His praise shall
continually be in my mouth!

23:04.890 --> 23:07.170
Yes.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.410
Now that's the Bishop Bruce's way.

23:09.460 --> 23:12.050
See, when you're preaching in the pulpit

23:12.100 --> 23:14.280
and when you're preaching on television,

23:14.330 --> 23:17.350
it's two different things.

23:17.400 --> 23:21.720
You see, in person, you can do, "Hey!

23:21.770 --> 23:24.220
Hey, hallelujah!

23:24.270 --> 23:27.490
Thank you, Jesus! Ha!"

23:27.540 --> 23:30.400
See, that's gonna put money
in the collection plate.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.370
But on television, it's
gonna make you look like

23:32.420 --> 23:34.670
a two-bit huckster from 1985.

23:34.720 --> 23:37.770
You see, when people
are watching television,

23:37.820 --> 23:39.910
they control the volume.

23:39.960 --> 23:45.750
We control the package and the message.

23:53.400 --> 23:57.060
See, people will scrutinize you

23:57.110 --> 23:59.330
from your collar

23:59.380 --> 24:02.830
to the stitches on your shirt.

24:02.880 --> 24:05.100
Now, I'm gonna need you

24:05.150 --> 24:08.870
to see Bishop Bruce's tailor immediately.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.080
We need to spruce you up.

24:16.130 --> 24:18.410
See, there are times you're going to be

24:18.460 --> 24:21.550
uncomfortable, off-balance!

24:21.600 --> 24:26.090
But you must always maintain the illusion

24:26.140 --> 24:28.290
of control!

24:28.340 --> 24:31.690
Absolutely. I understand.

24:31.740 --> 24:34.160
What happened before there was a universe?

24:34.210 --> 24:36.500
Where was God?

24:38.380 --> 24:40.800
The Almighty exists outside space and time.

24:40.850 --> 24:43.440
He's not bound by our earthly conceptions.

24:43.490 --> 24:45.540
God is eternal, he always
was, and always will be.

24:45.590 --> 24:47.740
How come we don't see miracles today?

24:47.790 --> 24:51.910
2,000 years ago, we used
to see miracles every day!

24:51.960 --> 24:53.910
Burning bushes, parting seas.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.480
Where are the miracles today?

24:55.530 --> 24:57.220
- They're all around you.
- I can't hear you!

24:57.270 --> 24:58.780
They're all around you!

24:58.830 --> 25:02.020
A newborn baby is a miracle.
Vaccines are miracles.

25:02.070 --> 25:03.020
Open-heart surgery.

25:03.070 --> 25:04.990
Let me ask you this.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.830
What's more miraculous,

25:06.880 --> 25:11.330
a burning bush or a
man walking on the moon?

25:13.920 --> 25:16.300
Praise be.

25:19.220 --> 25:22.340
Praise be.

25:24.430 --> 25:27.650
Please, Lord, let me be on time.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.290
Come on, Josh.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.560
Shit.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.160
What do you want?

25:43.210 --> 25:45.530
Thank God.

25:45.580 --> 25:49.600
Thank you, Jesus.

25:49.650 --> 25:51.170
You okay?

25:51.220 --> 25:54.870
I'm fine. You're fine, I'm fine.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.180
Okay, well, Jocelyn's not
here, and I'm not in the mood,

25:57.230 --> 25:59.910
so you have to find somebody
else to fuck with, Mr. Harris.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.450
No, that's not why I'm here.

26:01.500 --> 26:04.980
Look, I want to apologize.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.490
And not just "I'm sorry" apology,

26:07.540 --> 26:09.890
I really want to explain.

26:11.740 --> 26:13.090
Can I...

26:13.140 --> 26:16.930
can I come in?

26:16.980 --> 26:19.300
Please?

26:30.830 --> 26:35.220
And this is Bruce the third,
my youngest daughter's son.

26:35.270 --> 26:37.350
He's just a little slice of heaven.

26:37.400 --> 26:40.290
I put him in pageants.
Honey, he wins everything.

26:40.340 --> 26:42.790
I can see why. First Lady Congdon...

26:42.840 --> 26:44.290
Ahh, please, Ida.

26:44.340 --> 26:46.290
The First Lady lives in the White House.

26:46.340 --> 26:49.230
Mm, of course. I'm sorry. Ida...

26:49.280 --> 26:52.330
And stop apologizing.

26:52.380 --> 26:56.240
You are a strong, young disciple of God.

26:56.290 --> 26:57.940
But you're also human.

26:57.990 --> 27:03.010
If the Lord wanted us perfect,
he'd have made us perfect.

27:03.060 --> 27:04.840
I know.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.710
I just want to say...

27:07.760 --> 27:11.650
I am so excited for this
wonderful opportunity.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.890
I... I just want to learn
everything I can from you.

27:13.940 --> 27:18.560
Okay, here's my first little
tidbit for you to chew on.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.660
Listen to the phrases you're
using in your church flyer.

27:24.710 --> 27:28.070
"Jesus Jam." "Cornerstone Coffee Chat."

27:28.120 --> 27:29.640
Honey, we call this "Christianese."

27:29.690 --> 27:31.270
You don't want folks thinking they got to

27:31.320 --> 27:33.170
learn a new language to be born again.

27:33.220 --> 27:34.940
I didn't realize.

27:34.990 --> 27:36.340
Of course you didn't.

27:36.390 --> 27:38.040
And why would you?

27:38.090 --> 27:41.280
You're just starting out on your journey.

27:41.330 --> 27:44.150
So here's my second little tidbit.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.720
Start wearing blouses that fit.

27:48.540 --> 27:52.360
I know, I've, um, been stress eating.

27:52.410 --> 27:56.860
I guess I've been so
dedicated on others that, um...

27:56.910 --> 27:59.530
I haven't been taking care of myself.

28:32.010 --> 28:33.570
Tessie?

28:35.850 --> 28:37.540
I'm Crystal.

28:40.420 --> 28:42.610
Pleasure to meet you.

28:42.660 --> 28:45.480
What can I get you?

28:45.530 --> 28:47.910
- Frapin Cuvée, please.
- Sure.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.980
- Two.
- Okay.

28:50.030 --> 28:51.520
Frapin Cuvée?

28:51.570 --> 28:52.920
Special occasion?

28:55.670 --> 28:59.360
I'm not really that much
of a brandy woman, but...

28:59.410 --> 29:02.130
I do love the snifters they use here.

29:07.150 --> 29:10.400
It's Riedel Glass.

29:10.450 --> 29:13.040
Beautiful, no?

29:13.090 --> 29:14.610
Gorgeous.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.950
I used to have some just like these.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.160
A wedding present.

29:32.210 --> 29:34.190
Are you married?

29:34.240 --> 29:36.230
Not me.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.960
Never found the right person?

29:38.010 --> 29:39.130
Never looked.

29:43.590 --> 29:46.410
So how does this work?

29:46.460 --> 29:50.940
We meet, decide if we like each other,

29:50.990 --> 29:54.550
then... go upstairs?

29:54.600 --> 29:57.750
That's usually how it goes.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.120
Are we going upstairs?

30:00.170 --> 30:03.590
I like you.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.320
But I don't do women.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.590
Really?

30:07.640 --> 30:09.700
Is that a new rule?

30:09.750 --> 30:14.370
Because somehow I feel that...

30:14.420 --> 30:16.440
you've already fucked me.

30:16.490 --> 30:18.640
Hmm.

30:18.690 --> 30:21.970
Will you marry me?

30:22.020 --> 30:25.480
What do you think?

30:25.530 --> 30:28.110
Dude, I want to marry you.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.720
You asked me how much I would pay

30:34.770 --> 30:36.290
to have some more time with PJ.

30:36.340 --> 30:38.390
Bath Water software...

30:38.440 --> 30:41.590
Forget the money.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.730
I would lay down and die right now to have

30:43.780 --> 30:47.130
one more hour with him.

30:53.320 --> 30:56.980
To PJ, best friend I ever had.

30:57.030 --> 30:59.880
PJ, my son.

30:59.930 --> 31:02.250
Yeah,
well, for every excuse,

31:02.300 --> 31:03.820
there are two reasons why it's bullshit.

31:03.870 --> 31:06.620
I'm not doing this with you again, okay?

31:08.540 --> 31:10.490
- He was a good man, right?
- This isn't our decision.

31:10.540 --> 31:11.890
It's mine.

31:11.940 --> 31:13.390
Hold up,
hold up, Captain Queeg.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.500
So why did he do it?

31:15.550 --> 31:17.200
Why did he cheat on Jocelyn?

31:17.250 --> 31:19.870
This is our company.

31:21.750 --> 31:24.200
He didn't like talking about it,

31:24.250 --> 31:28.240
but I think this other woman
fed a different part of him.

31:28.290 --> 31:32.380
You know, he would talk code
to Jocelyn and me, and we...

31:32.430 --> 31:34.080
we'd just go into zombie mode.

31:34.130 --> 31:38.220
But I think this other woman, she lit up.

31:40.270 --> 31:43.260
For a while, he couldn't
get enough of that.

31:43.310 --> 31:46.760
And you never met her?

31:46.810 --> 31:50.630
He tried to keep it to himself.

31:50.680 --> 31:54.370
And Jocelyn never knew?

31:54.420 --> 31:59.070
No, I... I don't think she
should, especially not now.

31:59.120 --> 32:02.540
He loved her.

32:02.590 --> 32:05.850
That's all she needs to know.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.380
Boy, that's the truth.

32:07.430 --> 32:11.150
If we
disagree, who has final say?

32:11.200 --> 32:13.850
Yeah, no, if you want
to be a dick about it,

32:13.900 --> 32:16.260
which you clearly do, then
you have the final say.

32:16.310 --> 32:18.090
Yeah, exactly.

32:18.140 --> 32:21.730
Forget it, okay?
We'll... we'll do this later.

32:23.610 --> 32:26.570
Shit.

32:26.620 --> 32:29.230
That's gotta be it.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.670
That's gotta be the fucking book.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.470
Where is that book?

32:33.520 --> 32:34.870
It's right there.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.710
Jocelyn was flipping out about it too.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.140
She brought it back from her house.

32:39.190 --> 32:41.310
PJ had his...

32:41.360 --> 32:43.920
his programs in here, his flash drive.

32:43.970 --> 32:45.920
It's not the same book that's in the video.

32:45.970 --> 32:48.790
It's a different copy.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.290
Where the fuck is that copy?

32:50.340 --> 32:52.260
We don't know. PJ may have switched it out.

32:52.310 --> 32:55.960
Jocelyn thinks it could have been stolen.

32:56.010 --> 32:58.430
How many people knew this
program was in that book?

32:58.480 --> 33:01.030
Jocelyn and me, that's probably it.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.600
What about the girl he
was having the affair with?

33:03.650 --> 33:05.300
I doubt it.

33:05.350 --> 33:09.780
All right, listen to me.

33:09.830 --> 33:12.080
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

33:12.130 --> 33:14.280
but there are things in this world,

33:14.330 --> 33:16.820
things we just can't explain, like God.

33:16.870 --> 33:19.690
You believe in God?

33:19.740 --> 33:22.250
I guess. I think there's a higher power.

33:22.300 --> 33:27.260
There is. It's God and His son Jesus.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.900
And I have been anointed by Him.

33:31.950 --> 33:35.430
He has been sending me messages through PJ.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.640
Okay.

33:36.690 --> 33:37.870
It's not funny!

33:37.920 --> 33:41.370
PJ's been talking to me.

33:41.420 --> 33:44.010
As sure as I am standing
here in front of you,

33:44.060 --> 33:45.680
God has been speaking to me,

33:45.730 --> 33:48.980
and He wants me to avenge Jocelyn's rape.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.220
I think you're tired.

33:53.270 --> 33:57.090
And I know I am, so why don't
we just call it a night, huh?

33:57.140 --> 33:59.490
No, no.

33:59.540 --> 34:01.230
Hang on, hang on.

34:03.410 --> 34:06.500
I...

34:06.550 --> 34:09.770
I feel like I need to be
with somebody right now.

34:09.820 --> 34:11.469
I'm nervous to be alone.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.070
Okay, let me call Mrs. Harris.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.670
No, no, I don't want to add to any...

34:14.719 --> 34:18.739
whatever she's going through right now.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.550
I just... I get in these moods.

34:21.600 --> 34:24.780
I start to...

34:24.830 --> 34:28.050
think things, not good things.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.090
Talking to you is doing me more good

34:30.139 --> 34:31.920
than you could possibly imagine.

34:31.969 --> 34:35.260
Please, I know you're not
responsible, but please...

34:35.310 --> 34:38.159
can... can we just watch some more videos?

34:40.150 --> 34:42.469
Please?

34:49.219 --> 34:50.840
Okay.

34:57.670 --> 35:00.950
All right, first the good news.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.920
Ida and I would like to
officially welcome you both

35:03.970 --> 35:07.560
to Bishop Bruce's "One in
the Savior" Flock-Block.

35:07.610 --> 35:09.730
Oh, my goodness.

35:09.780 --> 35:11.130
Thank you.

35:11.180 --> 35:13.330
Bishop Bruce, you will
not regret this decision.

35:13.380 --> 35:16.740
It makes my spirit soar to think
of all the good I can spread,

35:16.790 --> 35:18.640
thanks to your generous backing.

35:18.690 --> 35:21.240
Save it for the TV, son.

35:21.290 --> 35:23.410
Now...

35:23.460 --> 35:26.450
the bad news.

35:26.500 --> 35:32.520
From this instant, you
both are now on probation.

35:32.570 --> 35:34.620
Have we done something wrong?

35:34.670 --> 35:36.390
Well, not yet.

35:36.440 --> 35:39.360
But the last fella I
took under my wing, he...

35:39.410 --> 35:41.560
he brought nothing but
shame and degradation

35:41.610 --> 35:42.830
to the House of Congdon.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.400
Um, what did he do?

35:45.450 --> 35:49.970
It's the craziest story. He
was running a 5K for charity.

35:50.020 --> 35:51.170
Good intentions, right?

35:51.220 --> 35:53.370
Well, turns out this fella

35:53.420 --> 35:57.480
enjoyed wearing ladies' panties
under his running shorts.

35:57.530 --> 36:02.250
Mm-hmm, well, someone got
a video of that, and...

36:02.300 --> 36:04.150
well, you know how video goes viral.

36:04.200 --> 36:08.320
Ka-boom! An explosion of shame.

36:09.940 --> 36:12.260
Let me put your mind at ease.

36:12.310 --> 36:15.230
I do not run marathons,
and I do not wear panties.

36:16.450 --> 36:17.960
You can dig through our
closets all you want,

36:18.010 --> 36:20.230
you will not find a single skeleton.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.840
Just beautifully tailored suits.

36:22.890 --> 36:26.940
Well, that's good, because when
you associate with Bishop Bruce,

36:26.990 --> 36:31.110
you must be pure as a
newborn baby's thoughts.

36:31.160 --> 36:33.850
Neither Paul or I would do anything

36:33.900 --> 36:35.710
to bring shame to your ministry.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.620
I know, sweetheart.

36:37.670 --> 36:40.350
So the only question is,

36:40.400 --> 36:44.120
what are you and Paul going
to do about your pregnancy?

36:44.170 --> 36:46.560
I'm a mother and a grandmother.

36:46.610 --> 36:49.330
I know the signs when I see them.

36:49.380 --> 36:53.830
Yes, and we can't have an unwed couple

36:53.880 --> 36:57.370
with a baby on the Flock Block.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.640
Of course not. We know.

37:03.690 --> 37:07.210
And we have already begun
to discuss our options.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.930
It's my
dad's favorite party trick.

37:24.910 --> 37:29.570
Mainly 'cause
everyone thinks he's crazy

37:29.620 --> 37:30.600
before they figure out...

37:40.560 --> 37:42.610
Come on!

37:47.700 --> 37:49.990
You are prettier than I expected,

37:50.040 --> 37:52.290
based on your rate.

37:52.340 --> 37:54.590
You know, you could probably
charge more if you wanted to.

37:54.640 --> 37:58.000
Or are you giving Pernell the
friends and family discount?

37:58.050 --> 38:00.330
We can cut to the chase.

38:00.380 --> 38:02.940
I'm happy to tell you what you came for.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.370
What is it you think I want?

38:05.420 --> 38:08.370
You're not the first wife
who's ever come looking for me.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.510
a reason why.

38:11.560 --> 38:14.480
Oh, that's very sweet.

38:14.530 --> 38:17.920
You think I want to know if you
do things in bed that I won't?

38:17.970 --> 38:20.820
Or did he get jungle fever,

38:20.870 --> 38:23.520
wanted a taste of the forbidden fruit?

38:23.570 --> 38:25.460
Or maybe you just want to tell me

38:25.510 --> 38:27.630
how you're so good at listening?

38:27.680 --> 38:32.300
Men cheat, women want a
reason. I understand that.

38:32.350 --> 38:35.800
It gives them hope. Something to fix.

38:35.850 --> 38:37.100
- Oh, honey...
- It's Tessie.

38:37.150 --> 38:39.100
It's my dime.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.140
I'll call you Hattie fucking
McDaniel if I want to.

38:42.190 --> 38:45.480
And any reason you want
to give me is bullshit.

38:45.530 --> 38:48.850
Men are selfish, and they're weak.

38:48.900 --> 38:51.320
Period.

38:55.740 --> 38:59.760
Well, if that's not why
you're here, then what is it?

39:01.280 --> 39:04.860
I need you to know who I am,

39:04.910 --> 39:07.600
so you can make an informed decision.

39:07.650 --> 39:08.730
About?

39:08.780 --> 39:11.600
Whether you will ever see Pernell again.

39:11.650 --> 39:12.840
Mm.

39:12.890 --> 39:17.340
You see, he and I had an
unwritten agreement that

39:17.390 --> 39:19.110
he could step out every now and then

39:19.160 --> 39:21.450
as long as he never brought it home

39:21.500 --> 39:23.680
and never put the family at risk.

39:23.730 --> 39:26.190
This is a violation.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.790
I don't tolerate violations.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.290
Mrs. Harris...

39:29.340 --> 39:30.990
Please, call me Crystal.

39:31.040 --> 39:33.460
We're fucking the same man,
might as well get chummy.

39:33.510 --> 39:37.530
Mrs. Harris, I have rules too.

39:37.580 --> 39:41.570
And if a client follows them,
he gets to see me. Period.

39:41.620 --> 39:44.000
You want to put an end to me and Pernell?

39:44.050 --> 39:45.640
Talk to Pernell.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.010
I'm starting with you,

39:48.060 --> 39:49.470
because my husband is sick.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.240
His brain is not working properly,

39:52.290 --> 39:56.020
which, by the way, completely explains you.

39:56.070 --> 40:00.190
See? Right there.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.260
You just gave yourself a why.

40:03.310 --> 40:04.390
You know, for a second,

40:04.440 --> 40:06.630
I thought you really were different.

40:08.440 --> 40:12.260
You have no idea how different I am.

40:12.310 --> 40:14.670
I have had to work for everything I have,

40:14.720 --> 40:17.170
and I have a lot.

40:17.220 --> 40:20.140
So I'm telling you right
now, woman to woman,

40:20.190 --> 40:24.580
if he calls you and
you don't turn him away,

40:24.630 --> 40:26.810
you will never forgive yourself.

40:26.860 --> 40:31.380
You are not the first wife
who's ever threatened me either.

40:31.430 --> 40:34.020
But I will give you extra
points for believability.

40:34.070 --> 40:35.220
Believe this:

40:35.270 --> 40:38.260
if you continue to blackmail my husband,

40:38.310 --> 40:40.030
I will have your ass thrown in jail.

40:40.080 --> 40:41.490
Excuse me?

40:41.540 --> 40:43.430
Although it does seem a
little odd for a hooker,

40:43.480 --> 40:46.030
blackmailing your clients.

40:46.080 --> 40:47.670
It's gotta kill your word of mouth.

40:47.720 --> 40:53.440
Mrs. Harris, I honestly do not
know what you are talking about.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.260
Hey, what's up, man? You
seen a 43 come this way?

41:18.310 --> 41:21.100
- Nah.
- How long you been waiting?

41:21.150 --> 41:22.800
Not long.

41:22.850 --> 41:24.540
Like how long?

41:30.390 --> 41:32.110
You work for him?

41:32.160 --> 41:34.150
Yeah, I know him.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.980
Well, where is he? I want to talk to him.

41:36.030 --> 41:37.920
That's not never gonna happen.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.290
You can look.

41:55.620 --> 41:57.770
Hey, your sister know you doing this?

41:57.820 --> 41:59.900
Sister ain't got nothing to do with this.

41:59.950 --> 42:02.670
I figured that, 'cause I
bet she wouldn't let you

42:02.720 --> 42:05.140
do something so stupid.

42:05.190 --> 42:08.350
You don't know me.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.450
I know you got potential.

42:10.500 --> 42:13.320
I know you pulling a 3.6 at Bethel.

42:13.370 --> 42:16.290
You must be thinking about college.

42:16.340 --> 42:20.330
But this... is a dummy move.

42:20.380 --> 42:23.300
I suggest you leave
the backpack where it is

42:23.350 --> 42:27.270
and play the long game.

42:27.320 --> 42:29.430
- You go to college, huh?
- Yeah.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.800
What you major in?

42:30.850 --> 42:33.340
Running errands for crazy, rich white men?

42:33.390 --> 42:35.740
Look, I didn't have to come here.

42:35.790 --> 42:37.680
I just thought maybe I
could get you to listen.

42:37.730 --> 42:42.050
Yeah, one young black
brother to another, right?

42:42.100 --> 42:44.080
All money ain't good money.

42:44.130 --> 42:45.950
Man, don't hate!

42:46.000 --> 42:48.750
Tuition is running through
the roof these days.

43:10.090 --> 43:12.710
I like Jocelyn.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.350
I always have.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.950
Course, she hates me right now.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.750
Fuck it. It's not about her. It's about PJ.

43:21.800 --> 43:24.690
Well, if it was about PJ, you'd let him go.

43:24.740 --> 43:27.930
You wouldn't put Jocelyn through this.

43:27.980 --> 43:30.130
I think it's about you.

43:30.180 --> 43:34.000
Me?

43:34.050 --> 43:35.900
She wants to pull the plug.

43:35.950 --> 43:37.570
You know, there's a
chance she could be wrong,

43:37.620 --> 43:40.270
and you can't come back from that shit.

43:40.320 --> 43:43.610
There's a chance PJ can wake up.

43:43.660 --> 43:46.580
It's like she's trying to play God.

43:46.630 --> 43:47.880
Jocelyn?

43:49.460 --> 43:52.280
Well, isn't that fucking rich.

43:52.330 --> 43:54.550
Isn't what rich?

43:54.600 --> 43:56.990
What if Jocelyn's wrong?
What if you're wrong?

43:57.040 --> 43:59.320
- If I'm wrong?
- Hmm.

43:59.370 --> 44:02.590
Shit. I'm not wrong.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.800
Okay.

44:03.850 --> 44:05.460
You sure about that, Judge Maximum?

44:05.510 --> 44:08.330
What about all the guys you
send to prison every day?

44:08.380 --> 44:09.770
What?

44:09.820 --> 44:11.800
Yeah, the folks who don't get a fair trial.

44:11.850 --> 44:13.440
People with shitty public defenders.

44:13.490 --> 44:15.570
People who are borderline incompetent

44:15.620 --> 44:17.610
and you just toss 'em to the wolves.

44:17.660 --> 44:19.580
Now you're a lawyer all of a sudden?

44:19.630 --> 44:21.510
Think you can do my job all of a sudden?

44:21.560 --> 44:23.010
No, but I'd be willing to bet

44:23.060 --> 44:25.380
there's at least one
innocent person in prison

44:25.430 --> 44:27.020
'cause of you, Mr. Life Without.

44:27.070 --> 44:29.050
You know how many scumbags
take a fucking hike

44:29.100 --> 44:31.920
because of a fucking bullshit technicality?

44:31.970 --> 44:33.120
When I got a chance to throw

44:33.170 --> 44:35.430
some fucking guilty motherfucker in prison,

44:35.480 --> 44:38.030
I fucking take it!

44:38.080 --> 44:40.200
You're pulling the same bleeding heart shit

44:40.250 --> 44:41.400
PJ used to pull out.

44:41.450 --> 44:42.800
But I'll tell you what,

44:42.850 --> 44:45.070
he changed his tune
after Jocelyn got raped.

44:45.120 --> 44:46.740
Then he wanted justice.

44:46.790 --> 44:50.680
I don't think PJ would be
okay with punishing someone

44:50.730 --> 44:53.350
who might be innocent,
even if it was a 1% chance.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.080
Yeah, well, maybe you didn't know PJ

44:55.130 --> 44:56.320
as good as you think you did.

44:56.370 --> 44:58.350
Oh, I knew him better than you did.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.750
Shut your fucking mouth.

44:59.800 --> 45:01.220
You know, you're pissing me off now.

45:01.270 --> 45:03.690
Yeah. I think it's time for you to leave.

45:03.740 --> 45:05.860
No.

45:05.910 --> 45:07.930
I'm not asking.

45:11.450 --> 45:13.470
Fine, I'll... I'll go.

45:13.520 --> 45:15.700
Be gone when I get back.

45:17.650 --> 45:19.840
I can't let you leave.

45:22.190 --> 45:23.380
What the fuck is wrong with you?

45:23.430 --> 45:25.680
I'm sorry.

45:25.730 --> 45:28.550
And I'm gonna need for
you to tie yourself up.

45:38.810 --> 45:41.530
Frida. Hi.

45:41.580 --> 45:44.260
- Hey, good to see you.
- Hi. Thank you.

45:44.310 --> 45:45.600
I'm glad you changed your mind.

45:45.650 --> 45:48.200
Oh, no, my plans for
a quiet evening at home

45:48.250 --> 45:49.500
kind of fell through, so...

45:49.550 --> 45:52.740
Then it's fate. I'll take it.

45:52.790 --> 45:54.110
Hey.

45:54.160 --> 45:57.980
- It's a good turnout, right?
- PJ was loved.

45:58.030 --> 46:00.040
So what are you reading?

46:00.090 --> 46:03.210
You know, it would be
everything if you read.

46:03.260 --> 46:06.220
Yeah, I, uh, haven't decided.

46:06.270 --> 46:08.450
Don't worry about it.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.260
- We are just glad you're here.
- Thank you.

46:11.310 --> 46:14.090
- Hey, Jocelyn.
- Hi.

46:19.150 --> 46:22.630
This is KD. Leave
a message and have a blessed day.

46:25.450 --> 46:27.210
Thirsty? Want a drink?

46:27.260 --> 46:28.710
Go fuck yourself.

46:32.330 --> 46:33.780
You know, you don't realize it now,

46:33.830 --> 46:35.480
but I'm actually helping you.

46:35.530 --> 46:38.550
I realize you're fucking nuts.

46:38.600 --> 46:41.150
Let me go now, I won't call the police.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.540
Hey, let me see your arms!

47:36.590 --> 47:38.010
- Where you going?
- Get over here.

47:38.060 --> 47:39.940
Yo, chill, chill, I'm
cool, yo. What the fuck?

47:39.990 --> 47:42.950
- What is this? No.
- On the fence.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.780
What's this? Turn around.

47:44.830 --> 47:47.490
Put your arms down.

47:47.540 --> 47:49.990
Don't resist.

47:50.040 --> 47:51.790
We found it, sir.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.120
You're under arrest.

47:53.170 --> 47:55.190
Possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.860
Cocaine? I don't know
what you're talking about!

47:57.910 --> 48:00.230
- I don't have no cocaine!
- Shut up!

48:04.250 --> 48:06.910
Holy shit, Officer, that is not mine!

48:06.960 --> 48:08.110
- Shut up!
- Right. On the fence.

48:08.160 --> 48:09.210
Don't move!

48:09.260 --> 48:10.210
I'm not a fucking drug dealer!

48:10.260 --> 48:11.510
Yeah, right.

48:11.560 --> 48:12.910
I swear to God, man, I'm not lying, man!

48:12.960 --> 48:14.650
- Shut up!
- Please! It's not mine!

48:14.700 --> 48:18.350
What's up, 2Pac?

48:18.400 --> 48:20.820
I need you to listen to me.

48:20.870 --> 48:23.660
This has been a test of
the Emergency Bobo System.

48:23.710 --> 48:25.260
This was only a test.

48:25.310 --> 48:26.590
Had this been a real emergency,

48:26.640 --> 48:27.890
this wake-up call would have been followed

48:27.940 --> 48:30.630
by you getting your ass
permanently fucked up!

48:30.680 --> 48:32.400
What? What?

48:32.450 --> 48:33.800
- Don't move.
- Man...

48:33.850 --> 48:35.970
Khalil, Khalil, Khalil, you made a mistake.

48:36.020 --> 48:37.540
You stepped into the ring without knowing

48:37.590 --> 48:38.940
who you were up against.

48:38.990 --> 48:41.270
Now you see how quickly things can change.

48:41.320 --> 48:42.540
One minute, you're holding on to more money

48:42.590 --> 48:44.040
than you ever seen in your life.

48:44.090 --> 48:45.780
The next minute, you're
looking at 20 years in prison.

48:45.830 --> 48:48.250
Yo, this shit is not mine, yo, I swear!

48:48.300 --> 48:50.850
Yeah, that might be true.

48:50.900 --> 48:54.950
But it doesn't matter, see what I mean?

48:55.000 --> 48:57.960
There is a possibility,
however, that I will be merciful

48:58.010 --> 49:01.030
and drop all the charges against
you if you agree to my terms.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.160
Yeah! Absolutely, what
are... what are the terms?

49:03.210 --> 49:06.300
Please, please shut up, dummy.
I'm getting to the terms.

49:06.350 --> 49:09.370
First, you bring me the marriage
certificate, the original.

49:09.420 --> 49:12.100
Second, you never, and I
mean never the fuck ever,

49:12.150 --> 49:16.170
talk to or about or even look
at Judge Pernell Harris again.

49:16.220 --> 49:18.710
Do you agree to these terms?

49:18.760 --> 49:20.980
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah!

49:21.030 --> 49:23.820
Good, then this concludes our test

49:23.870 --> 49:25.920
of the Emergency Bobo System.

49:25.970 --> 49:28.990
You may now resume back to your
regularly scheduled program.

49:29.040 --> 49:30.620
Now let's get the fuck out of here!

49:30.670 --> 49:32.420
- Move out.
- Yeah.

49:57.300 --> 50:02.350
Thank you, everyone, for
coming out tonight to honor PJ.

50:02.400 --> 50:08.030
It's... The outpouring
of... of love and support,

50:08.080 --> 50:10.600
it's, uh...

50:10.650 --> 50:12.160
it's overwhelming.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.230
Okay.

50:25.260 --> 50:27.050
Okay.

50:33.430 --> 50:35.050
Um...

50:36.240 --> 50:40.460
I was gonna read PJ's favorite poem...

50:40.510 --> 50:43.660
but, um...

50:43.710 --> 50:47.070
instead, I'm... I'm gonna read an original.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.330
Um...

50:50.420 --> 50:52.170
A PJ original.

51:09.400 --> 51:13.760
"Dear Jocelyn,

51:13.810 --> 51:18.800
What a man can be, he must be, she said.

51:18.850 --> 51:21.930
Though not out loud.

51:21.980 --> 51:27.140
What a man must not be,
he cannot be, he said,

51:27.190 --> 51:29.840
with a pop.

51:29.890 --> 51:32.980
Can I make you love me again?

51:33.030 --> 51:36.450
In a letter, for losing?

51:36.500 --> 51:39.980
If the letter is the
last thing left of me,

51:40.030 --> 51:42.890
will it sit on your shelf, with my ashes,

51:42.940 --> 51:47.460
gathering dust to dust?

51:47.510 --> 51:50.190
Look, look,

51:50.240 --> 51:54.000
you were right.

51:54.050 --> 51:58.000
That gun, it is going to protect you.

51:58.050 --> 52:01.740
It's going to protect me too.

52:01.790 --> 52:04.740
From my memory.

52:04.790 --> 52:07.480
You remember?

52:07.530 --> 52:13.020
Not the screams in the
dark, not everything breaking,

52:13.070 --> 52:17.420
but when we spoke all
night until the light came

52:17.470 --> 52:21.030
in with the Dominican
music from the neighbors.

52:21.080 --> 52:26.000
Kissing in the cab, in the club.

52:26.050 --> 52:28.870
Telling me your dreams about tidal waves

52:28.920 --> 52:31.870
over the phone during finals.

52:31.920 --> 52:36.110
Cramped sex in a cramped dorm room

52:36.160 --> 52:40.780
with a burning hot pipe.

52:40.830 --> 52:44.050
I do."

52:49.070 --> 52:51.590
Did he talk about what kind of a dad I was?

52:51.640 --> 52:55.460
I'm okay with the truth.

52:55.510 --> 52:58.160
He worshipped you.

52:58.210 --> 52:59.960
He talked about you all the time.

53:00.010 --> 53:03.030
"My dad this, my dad that.

53:03.080 --> 53:05.900
If it wasn't for my dad"...

53:05.950 --> 53:08.610
Even though I was so hard on him?

53:08.660 --> 53:09.910
I think the older he got,

53:09.960 --> 53:13.210
the more he appreciated your tough love.

53:13.260 --> 53:14.510
Really?

53:14.560 --> 53:17.420
Why is that surprising?
You're a great father.

53:17.470 --> 53:20.350
How many fathers would
do what you're doing?

53:20.400 --> 53:23.820
He used to say you were
the greatest dad ever.

53:23.870 --> 53:27.930
Kind of corny.

53:27.980 --> 53:29.630
I do love him,

53:29.680 --> 53:32.100
even though I didn't always
show it like I should've.

53:34.880 --> 53:37.870
That's disgusting. Is that real?

53:37.920 --> 53:40.910
Yeah, that's real.

54:06.610 --> 54:08.000
Josh?

54:09.920 --> 54:12.000
Josh! Wait!

54:15.560 --> 54:16.880
Hey, Josh?

54:16.930 --> 54:18.610
Hey.

54:31.070 --> 54:33.520
He didn't confess,

54:33.570 --> 54:35.490
and he didn't accept Jesus either.

54:45.320 --> 54:46.740
What?

54:46.790 --> 54:51.640
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

54:54.660 --> 54:57.920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

54:57.970 --> 54:59.720
I'm so sorry.

54:59.770 --> 55:01.920
I'm so s... I'm so sorry.

55:01.970 --> 55:03.690
Why are you sorry?

55:06.840 --> 55:08.730
Judge Harris,

55:08.780 --> 55:11.430
why are you sorry?
