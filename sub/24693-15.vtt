AND HE LETS THE SHOOTER
GET WITHIN A COUPLE OF FEET?

04:31.705 --> 04:33.237
WELL, IT WAS EITHER
A RANDOM ACT

04:33.239 --> 04:35.673
OR HE KNEW HIS ASSAILANT
AND DIDN'T FEEL THREATENED.

04:37.242 --> 04:38.810

04:38.812 --> 04:41.245

HE HAS MUSIC LESSONS
TWICE A WEEK.

05:12.262 --> 05:13.795

05:13.797 --> 05:15.296
AND HE'S HOW OLD?

05:15.298 --> 05:18.266
TWO. HE MOSTLY
JUST BANGS.

05:18.268 --> 05:19.433
LOOK AT THIS.

05:19.435 --> 05:21.803
CHINESE.

05:21.805 --> 05:23.805
THAT'S A DIFFICULT
LANGUAGE.

05:23.807 --> 05:25.857
CAN HE SAY ANYTHING YET?

05:25.859 --> 05:28.076
HE'S STILL LEARNING
ENGLISH.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.544
BUT HE HAS CHINESE CLASS
EVERY THURSDAY.

05:30.546 --> 05:33.898
THURSDAY.
SO HE HAD CLASS TODAY.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.349

LEO END UP IN THE PARK?</i>

05:37.620 --> 05:39.069
I'M NOT SURE.

05:39.071 --> 05:41.455
MR. LOWE ALWAYS
PICKS LEO UP AFTER CLASS.

05:41.457 --> 05:43.708
I GUESS THEY DECIDED
TO GO TO THE PLAYGROUND.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.177
YOU GUESS.
YOU WEREN'T WITH THEM.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.745
NO, HE CALLED.
HE SAID HE WAS RUNNING LATE.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.630
THAT SOMETHING
CAME UP AT WORK.

05:49.632 --> 05:52.384
<i>I HAD TO GET BACK</i>
<i>TO MY OWN KIDS,</i>

05:52.386 --> 05:55.119
SO I HAD TO LEAVE LEO
WITH A MOM IN THE CLASS.

05:55.121 --> 05:56.387
MARLA.

05:56.389 --> 05:59.841
SKIP DIDN'T GET TO CLASS
TILL AFTER 5:30.

05:59.843 --> 06:00.858
HERE YOU GO, HANK.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.660
GRITS LIKE YOU LOVE,
EXTRA BUTTER.

06:02.662 --> 06:04.662
BUT HIS BOY AND MINE
WERE HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME,

06:04.664 --> 06:06.163
I DIDN'T MIND.

06:06.165 --> 06:08.832
DID HE SAY WHY
HE WAS LATE?

06:08.834 --> 06:11.735
NO. HE WENT
TO THE GYM, I THINK.

06:11.737 --> 06:13.337
HE HAD WET HAIR.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.573
(Goren) DID YOU KNOW
SKIP LOWE WELL?

06:15.575 --> 06:17.725
NOT SO MUCH.

06:17.727 --> 06:19.327
HE SEEMED SWEET
WITH HIS KID.

06:19.329 --> 06:21.996
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
GET A LOT OF STRAIGHT DADS

06:21.998 --> 06:23.364
DOING PICKUPS.

06:23.366 --> 06:25.233
WHAT ABOUT LEO'S MOM,
KELLY?

06:25.235 --> 06:26.684
I NEVER MET HER.

06:26.686 --> 06:28.619
YOU KNOW,
MOST OF THE MOMS WORK.

06:28.621 --> 06:30.388
IT'S JUST ME
AND THE NANNIES.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.891
<i>(Goren) SO AFTER CLASS,
DID SKIP SAY ANYTHING</i>

06:32.893 --> 06:35.760
<i>ABOUT WHERE HE WAS GOING NEXT?</i>

06:35.762 --> 06:37.829
WE ALL WENT TO THE PARK
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW,

06:37.831 --> 06:40.682
LET THE KIDS RUN AROUND,
GET TIRED BEFORE YOU GO HOME.

06:40.684 --> 06:42.517
BUT IT GETS DARK
SO EARLY THESE DAYS,

06:42.519 --> 06:43.918
WE ALL LEFT AROUND 6:00.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.271
MARLA, IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE

06:46.273 --> 06:48.372
TO TALK ABOUT THIS
IN FRONT OF HENRY.

06:48.374 --> 06:50.775
OH, I DON'T THINK
HANK UNDERSTANDS.

06:50.777 --> 06:54.112
I'M ELEANOR REYNOLDS,
HENRY'S GRANDMOTHER.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.264
REALLY? YOU LIVE HERE?

06:56.266 --> 06:59.900
MAY I ASK YOU TO SPEAK
TO MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW OUTSIDE?

06:59.902 --> 07:02.737
HENRY'S HAVING BREAKFAST.
WE CAN JUST TALK IN THE...

07:02.739 --> 07:04.572
WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU FEEDING HIM?

07:06.542 --> 07:08.325
<i>MARLA!</i>

07:08.327 --> 07:10.978
THIS IS NOT
THE TRAILER PARK.

07:12.798 --> 07:14.398
DON'T MIND
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.400
SHE'S UPSET.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.569
SHE WAS WITH US
AT THE PLAYGROUND YESTERDAY.

07:18.571 --> 07:22.240
AND DID YOU NOTICE
IF SKIP WAS WORRIED OR AGITATED?

07:22.242 --> 07:24.975
HE AND HIS WIFE
KEPT TRADING MESSAGES.

07:24.977 --> 07:26.144
SHE TRAVELS SO MUCH.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.079
WITH A TODDLER AT HOME,
IT MUST BE HARD.

07:29.081 --> 07:30.531
<i>WHERE ARE YOU GOING?</i>

07:30.533 --> 07:32.416
HE HASN'T FINISHED
HIS BREAKFAST.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.919
SWIFTY'S.
FOR EGGS AND SOLDIERS.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.220
I'LL GET MY COAT.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.289
OH, WE WON'T BE LONG.

07:39.608 --> 07:41.493
WE'LL GET SOME
REAL BREAKFAST NOW, HONEY.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.944
[cell phone rings]

07:42.946 --> 07:46.164
IT'S HER HOUSE.
SHE LIVES UPSTAIRS.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.448
SKIP'S WIFE KELLY.

07:47.450 --> 07:49.951
HER FLIGHT FROM DALLAS
JUST LANDED.

07:49.953 --> 07:52.186
I TRAVEL A LOT FOR MY JOB.

07:52.188 --> 07:55.456
BUT, UH, SKIP AND I,
WE WERE... WE WERE BLISSFUL.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.625
AND WE'D FOUND OUR BALANCE.

07:57.627 --> 07:59.744
YOU'RE LUCKY,
HAVING A TODDLER,

07:59.746 --> 08:02.297
BOTH OF YOU WORKING
FULL-TIME.

08:02.299 --> 08:03.430
IT'S STRESSFUL.

08:03.432 --> 08:05.399
SKIP WAS VERY DRIVEN.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.201
COMPETITIVE.
BUT...

08:07.203 --> 08:09.470
HE MANAGED TO FIND
WAYS TO RELAX.

08:09.472 --> 08:10.722
LIKE GOING TO THE GYM.

08:10.724 --> 08:14.308
YEAH. HE TOOK AN EARLY
SPINNING CLASS ALMOST EVERY DAY.

08:14.310 --> 08:16.511
SO HE NEVER WENT
TO THE GYM AFTER WORK.

08:16.513 --> 08:18.830
WELL, HE MUST HAVE YESTERDAY.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.665
IS THAT WHY YOU KEPT
MISSING EACH OTHER?

08:21.667 --> 08:25.536
I USUALLY CALL HIM.
AT CLOSING BELL.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.838
AND, UH...

08:27.840 --> 08:28.839
[ahem]

08:28.841 --> 08:29.973
YESTERDAY THE OFFICE SAID

08:29.975 --> 08:31.709
THAT HE'D ALREADY
LEFT FOR THE DAY.

08:36.264 --> 08:37.515
<i>(Eames) LOWE TOLD HIS NANNY</i>

08:37.517 --> 08:39.017
HE WAS TIED UP
AT THE OFFICE,

08:39.019 --> 08:41.485
BUT HE WASN'T THERE
TO TAKE HIS WIFE'S CALL.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.821
CLOSING BELL'S AT 4:00.

08:43.823 --> 08:47.491
LOWE GOT TO HIS CHINESE CLASS
AFTER 5:30.

08:47.493 --> 08:50.061
SO LOWE HAS A WIFE
AWAY ON BUSINESS,

08:50.063 --> 08:52.664
A ONE-HOUR HOLE
IN HIS AFTERNOON,

08:52.666 --> 08:54.766

WET HAIR.

08:56.401 --> 08:57.902
AN AFFAIR?
SKIP LOWE?

08:57.904 --> 08:59.437
NO. I DON'T THINK SO.

08:59.439 --> 09:00.905
HIS NUMBER WAS TOO LOW.

09:00.907 --> 09:02.173
HIS NUMBER?

09:02.175 --> 09:04.442
THE NUMBER HE HAD TO HIT
BEFORE HE RETIRED?

09:04.444 --> 09:06.194
11. AND NOT FOR
JAMAL CRAWFORD.

09:06.196 --> 09:09.063
IF YOU'RE CHEATING,
YOU THINK DIVORCE,

09:09.065 --> 09:10.531
INCREASE YOUR NUMBER.

09:10.533 --> 09:13.767
SKIP HASN'T BUDGED FROM

YEAH, WE ALL DO THAT.

09:18.507 --> 09:21.542

ACTUALLY DISAPPEARS.

09:21.544 --> 09:23.577
WELL, GOOD.
RESTORE IT.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.948
DON'T TELL HIS WIFE.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.396
HIS PRIVATE ACCOUNT,

09:41.398 --> 09:45.199
BIGSKIPPER'S NOT
HIS COMPANY ADDRESS, IS IT?

09:47.302 --> 09:49.537
YOU CAN... GO NOW.

09:55.977 --> 09:58.713

11:25.034 --> 11:27.001
NO! IT WAS A PERFECT

11:36.529 --> 11:38.045
CAUTIOUS.

11:38.047 --> 11:40.348
WE EMAILED YOU,
AND 45 MINUTES LATER

11:40.350 --> 11:42.416
YOU WERE OFFERING
MY PARTNER A REWARD.

11:42.418 --> 11:45.069
BEFORE I MAKE A MOVE,
I S-SUGGEST WE GO UNSAFE,

11:45.071 --> 11:47.405
TELL THEM I'M NOT
REALLY MARRIED

11:47.407 --> 11:48.755
AND TRY TO LURE THEM IN.

11:48.757 --> 11:51.342
IF THEY AGREE TO ANY OF THAT,
I'M OUT OF THERE.

11:56.030 --> 11:57.531
<i>(Goren) OKAY, THANK YOU.</i>

11:57.533 --> 11:59.466
I DON'T MAKE KEVYN
AS A KILLER.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.368
HE'S MARRIED, GETTING
WHAT HE WANTS ON THE SIDE.

12:01.370 --> 12:02.903
IT WORKS FOR HIM.

12:02.905 --> 12:05.005
THAT WAS KEVYN'S BOSS.

12:05.007 --> 12:08.509
HE CONFIRMS THAT KEVYN
GOT BACK FROM THE GYM AT 5:15.

12:08.511 --> 12:10.277
HE STAYED UNTIL 10:00.

12:10.279 --> 12:13.046
DID HIS WIFE KNOW ABOUT
HIS DOUBLE LIFE?

12:13.048 --> 12:14.548
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
OF THAT.

12:14.550 --> 12:15.849
SHE WAS OUT OF TOWN,

12:15.851 --> 12:18.385
BUT FROM HER PERSPECTIVE,
THE MARRIAGE WAS GOOD.

12:18.387 --> 12:20.787
THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING WE'RE MISSING.

12:20.789 --> 12:24.124
CAPTAIN,
THIS IS SKIP'S DARK SIDE.

12:24.126 --> 12:26.594
THE REST OF HIS LIFE,
IT SEEMS CLEAN.

12:26.596 --> 12:30.197
FATHER SHOT WHILE
WALKING HIS TWO-YEAR-OLD HOME.

12:30.199 --> 12:32.499
HATE TO THINK
THIS WAS A RANDOM ACT.

12:37.923 --> 12:41.358
[whining]

12:59.761 --> 13:03.097
[baby crying]

13:03.099 --> 13:06.367
[dog barking]

13:06.369 --> 13:09.704
[baby crying]

13:19.647 --> 13:22.149
(Eames) PALOMA RENZI,
CORPORATE EXEC.

13:22.151 --> 13:24.085
MOTHER OF LILY, TWO.

13:24.087 --> 13:25.536
OUT FOR A MORNING
DOG WALK.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.304
THE TEENAGED GIRL
ON HORSEBACK

13:27.306 --> 13:28.606
CAME ACROSS THE BODY.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.575
SAID LILY WAS STILL
IN THE STROLLER, UNHARMED.

13:33.945 --> 13:35.546
SHE WAS SHOT AT CLOSE RANGE.

13:35.548 --> 13:39.016
ONCE IN THE BACK.
THAT'S ANOTHER .22.

13:39.018 --> 13:41.785
ANOTHER SINGLE SHOT.
ANOTHER TUNNEL.

13:41.787 --> 13:46.307
A WOMAN PUSHING 50 POUNDS
OF STROLLER ON GRAVEL.

13:46.309 --> 13:47.941
A SLOW-MOVING TARGET.

13:47.943 --> 13:51.111
AND THE GRAVEL IS...
IS NOISY.

13:52.314 --> 13:54.114
SHE WOULD HAVE HEARD
SOMEONE BEHIND HER.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.034
SHE SAW HER KILLER.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.587
YEAH.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.489
AND THEN SHE WOULD
HAVE TURNED.

14:01.491 --> 14:03.257
<i>AND THEN...</i>

14:03.259 --> 14:04.942
THEN SHE...

14:04.944 --> 14:08.178
TURNED... HER BACK.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.548
SHE DIDN'T
PERCEIVE A THREAT.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.334
WHY NOT?

14:13.336 --> 14:17.037
LILY'S UNCLE IS FLYING IN
FROM CALIFORNIA TO TAKE HER.

14:17.039 --> 14:20.307
HE HAS A LOT OF KIDS
AND DOGS.

14:20.309 --> 14:22.376
LILY WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

14:22.378 --> 14:25.045
PALOMA WASN'T MARRIED.

14:25.047 --> 14:27.431
WAS SHE INVOLVED
WITH ANYONE?

14:27.433 --> 14:29.233
NO... SHE TOLD ME
SHE HAD A FIANCE

14:29.235 --> 14:31.535
WHO PASSED AWAY
YEARS AGO.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.704
GUESS SHE NEVER FOUND
ANYONE ELSE.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.940
SHE FOUND LILY.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.491
PALOMA WORKS.

14:37.493 --> 14:40.160
BUT THE REST OF HER LIFE
IS ABOUT HER DAUGHTER.

14:40.162 --> 14:42.996
SHE MOVED HERE SO SHE COULD
WALK LILY TO PRESCHOOL

14:42.998 --> 14:44.231
JUST DOWN THE BLOCK.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.217
NOW, ON SATURDAY,

14:46.219 --> 14:49.954
SHE ALWAYS GOES FOR A WALK
WITH LILY, WITH THE DOG?

14:49.956 --> 14:51.622
EVERY WEEKEND.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.391
NO MATTER WHAT THE WEATHER,

14:53.393 --> 14:55.793
SHE'D BUNDLE LILY UP,
TAKE HER TO THE PARK.

14:55.795 --> 14:59.313
SHE FELT BAD WE DIDN'T
HAVE OUTDOOR SPACE,

14:59.315 --> 15:02.216
THAT LILY WAS COOPED UP
IN THE APARTMENT.

15:03.919 --> 15:07.387
I GUESS LILY WILL HAVE
A BACKYARD NOW.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.324
BALLISTICS CONFIRMS
THE SAME GUN

15:10.326 --> 15:12.192
KILLED BOTH PALOMA
AND LOWE.

15:12.194 --> 15:14.294
DID THEY KNOW EACH OTHER?
WAS THERE A CONNECTION?

15:14.296 --> 15:15.730
THEY BOTH WORKED
ON WALL STREET.

15:15.732 --> 15:18.582
LOWE AS A TELECOM ANALYST
AT HERRON GREEN

15:18.584 --> 15:21.051
AND PALOMA
AS A VP AT QUAL-XT.

15:21.053 --> 15:24.088
QUAL-XT
THE TELECOM COMPANY.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.756
DID LOWE ANALYZE THEIR STOCK?

15:25.758 --> 15:26.690
LET'S SEE.

15:28.443 --> 15:29.794
<i>HERE WE GO.</i>

15:29.796 --> 15:32.246
HERRON GREEN ISSUED
A NEW REPORT TWO DAYS AGO.

15:32.248 --> 15:35.566
<i>SKIP WENT FROM A HOLD</i>
<i>TO A STRONG BUY.</i>

15:35.568 --> 15:37.734
HE FLIPPED HIS RATING.
WAS HE ALONE IN THAT?

15:37.736 --> 15:39.469
[typing]

15:39.471 --> 15:42.006
YEP, FOUR OTHER TOP FIRMS
RATED QUAL-XT

15:42.008 --> 15:45.343
<i>A HOLD, AN UNDERWEIGHT,</i>
<i>A SELL, AND A HOLD.</i>

15:45.345 --> 15:47.661
STOCK ANALYSTS USUALLY
LINE UP IN LOCKSTEP.

15:47.663 --> 15:50.664
FIND OUT WHY LOWE
WAS SO POSITIVE ABOUT QUAL-XT.

15:52.934 --> 15:54.735
PALOMA WAS DEAR TO US.

15:54.737 --> 15:57.705
QUAL-XT HAS OFFERED
A REWARD TO CATCH HER KILLER.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.241
HOW WELL DID YOU KNOW HER,
MR. WRIGHT?

16:00.243 --> 16:02.276
SHE WAS MY NUMBER TWO
FOR TEN YEARS.

16:02.278 --> 16:06.714
ANY IDEA
IF SHE AND SKIP LOWE

16:06.716 --> 16:08.949
EVER CROSSED PATHS?

16:08.951 --> 16:10.651
LOWE, THE ANALYST
WHO WAS SHOT?

16:10.653 --> 16:12.253
I'M SURE SHE TOOK
HIS CALLS.

16:12.255 --> 16:14.154
WE WANT THOSE GUYS
ON OUR SIDE.

16:14.156 --> 16:15.605
WELL, SHE GOT HIM THERE.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.708
COUPLE DAYS AGO,
LOWE UPGRADED YOUR COMPANY

16:17.710 --> 16:19.609
FROM A HOLD
TO A STRONG BUY.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.729
SOMETIMES THE CRITICS
GET IT RIGHT.

16:21.731 --> 16:22.796
WE'RE ROLLING OUT

16:22.798 --> 16:24.515
SOME INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS
NEXT QUARTER.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.668
WELL, YOUR STOCK
WENT UP SHARPLY

16:27.670 --> 16:30.271
THE DAY THAT LOWE'S
REPORT WAS PUBLISHED.

16:30.273 --> 16:33.056
GOOD RATING WILL DO THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

16:33.058 --> 16:35.592
LOOK, WE READ THE OTHER
ANALYSTS' REPORTS.

16:35.594 --> 16:39.063
WE KNOW LOWE
WAS YOUR ONLY FAN.

16:39.065 --> 16:41.982
<i>WE'RE WONDERING IF SOMEONE</i>

16:41.984 --> 16:44.652
THOUGHT SKIP AND PALOMA
WERE IN COLLUSION.

16:44.654 --> 16:47.521
DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT
READ ON THE BLOGS,

16:47.523 --> 16:49.740
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THINGS WORK ANYMORE.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.526
WE PRIDE OURSELVES
ON OUR TRANSPARENCY.

16:52.528 --> 16:54.111
<i>PALOMA WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING</i>

16:54.113 --> 16:56.046
<i>TO COMPROMISE OUR REPUTATION.</i>

16:56.048 --> 16:57.614
THE... THE BLOGS.
SOMEONE'S FLAMING YOU?

16:57.616 --> 16:59.283
IT'S A VOLATILE MARKET.

16:59.285 --> 17:02.486
PEOPLE LOSE MONEY.
THEY HUNT FOR A SCAPEGOAT.

17:02.488 --> 17:05.256
ANY IDEA WHO?

17:05.258 --> 17:07.191
YEAH, THAT'S MY BLOG.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.093
I LOST MORE IN ONE DAY

17:09.095 --> 17:11.328
THAN YOU'LL EARN
IN A THOUSAND YEARS.

17:12.664 --> 17:15.132
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD
A GOOD REASON TO BE UPSET.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.634
[laughs] UPSET?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.502
I'M OUT $50 MILLION.

17:18.503 --> 17:20.271
IF YOU ASK ME,
SKIP GOT HIS.

17:20.272 --> 17:23.374
MEANING YOU THINK
HE PROFITED FROM THE REPORT

17:23.376 --> 17:25.709
OR YOU THINK HE DESERVED
TO BE MURDERED?

17:25.711 --> 17:26.843
BOTH.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.311
THERE'S NO WAY
HE WRITES THAT REPORT

17:28.314 --> 17:30.281
WITHOUT GETTING
SOMETHING OUT OF IT.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.649
HE'S TOO GOOD
AN ANALYST.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.785
WHERE WERE YOU
THE NIGHT SKIP WAS MURDERED?

17:34.787 --> 17:37.288
UPSTAIRS.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.806
THIS IS AS FAR FROM
MY OFFICE AS I GET.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.508
YOU CAN ASK MY STAFF.
THEY ALL HATE ME.

17:41.510 --> 17:44.178
I NEVER GO HOME,
SO, UH, NO ONE ELSE CAN.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.547
[chuckles]

17:46.549 --> 17:47.798
[footsteps]

17:47.800 --> 17:49.567
<i>(Eames) JOHN ECKHARDT'S
ALIBI CHECKS.</i>

17:49.569 --> 17:52.837
HE WAS HOOKED TO HIS TERMINAL
LIKE A JUNKIE.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.839
IT'S MOOT... LOWE AND
PALOMA WEREN'T KILLED

17:54.841 --> 17:56.674
FOR THEIR WALL STREET
CONNECTION.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.909
A THIRD VICTIM
SHOWED UP.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.528
IN THE PARK?

18:00.530 --> 18:02.179
NO, AT A HOSPITAL
IN FAR ROCKAWAY.

18:02.181 --> 18:05.849
DENISE MYLER WAS SHOT
IN THE CHEST TEN DAYS AGO.

18:05.851 --> 18:06.950
SHE DIED YESTERDAY.

18:06.952 --> 18:08.819
WHEN THE M.E.
PULLED THE BULLET OUT,

18:08.821 --> 18:11.755
IT WAS A MATCH FOR THE BULLETS
THAT KILLED LOWE AND PALOMA.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.909
SHE WAS SHOT IN HER CAR
IN THE LAUNDROMAT PARKING LOT.

18:15.911 --> 18:19.079
HER TWO-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
WAS STRAPPED IN THE CAR SEAT.

18:19.081 --> 18:21.047
MAKES HER
OUR FIRST VICTIM.

18:21.049 --> 18:23.216
WE COULD BE LOOKING
AT A HUNTER.

18:23.218 --> 18:25.252
THREE SHOOTINGS
IN TWO WEEKS?

18:25.254 --> 18:27.320
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE
DEALING WITH HERE?

18:27.322 --> 18:30.357
SON OF SAM KILLING PARENTS
IN FRONT OF THEIR KIDS?

18:37.465 --> 18:39.400
(Eames) DENISE MYLER.

18:39.402 --> 18:40.634
LIVED IN FAR ROCKAWAY.

18:40.636 --> 18:42.569
WORKED AS A COOK
IN A SOUP KITCHEN

18:42.571 --> 18:44.271
ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE.

18:44.273 --> 18:47.141
SOUP KITCHEN.
LONG WAY FROM WALL STREET.

18:47.143 --> 18:48.542
PRECINCT HAVE ANY SUSPECTS?

18:48.544 --> 18:51.745
DENISE HAD JUST TAKEN OUT
AN Jo..Jo..P. AGAINST HER HUSBAND.

18:51.747 --> 18:53.880
THEY ASSUMED
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,

18:53.882 --> 18:55.416
PICKED UP TIM MYLER.

18:55.418 --> 18:56.984
WHERE'S MYLER NOW?

18:56.986 --> 18:58.252
HE DIDN'T MAKE BAIL.

18:58.254 --> 19:00.854
HE'S BEEN IN RIKERS
FOR A WEEK AND A HALF.

19:00.856 --> 19:04.341
WELL, SO HE COULDN'T HAVE
KILLED LOWE OR PALOMA.

19:04.343 --> 19:06.510
THEY WERE ALL SHOT
WITH THE SAME GUN.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.745
HE PROBABLY DIDN'T
KILL HIS WIFE EITHER.

19:08.747 --> 19:12.015
THE WRONG GUY.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.850
THAT'S WHAT I BEEN
SAYING ALL ALONG.

19:13.852 --> 19:16.587
I DON'T OWN A GUN.
THIS IS A MISTAKE.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.138
I DIDN'T KILL DENISE.

19:18.140 --> 19:20.224
<i>THE THING IS,</i>
<i>YOUR POLICE REPORT SAYS</i>

19:20.226 --> 19:21.725
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
AN ALIBI.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.860
MAN, THE COPS NEVER
CHECKED MY ALIBI.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.362
I DRIVE A LIMO.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.832
I WAS CIRCLING THE BLOCK,
WAITING FOR SOME GOLDEN BOY.

19:28.834 --> 19:32.102
I DON'T THINK
MY PARTNER BELIEVES YOU.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.553
THE DOORMAN AT THE RALEIGH
CAN VOUCH FOR ME.

19:33.555 --> 19:35.823
WHY'D YOUR WIFE
TAKE OUT AN Jo..Jo..P.?

19:35.825 --> 19:38.926
SHE OVERREACTED, MAN.
I WASN'T STALKING HER.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.527
SO YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO BE PARKED

19:40.529 --> 19:42.495
IN FRONT OF HER APARTMENT
24 HOURS A DAY?

19:42.497 --> 19:44.731
DENISE AND I,
WE HAVE A DAUGHTER TOGETHER.

19:44.733 --> 19:46.750
I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT TIFFANY.

19:46.752 --> 19:49.353
STRANGE MEN IN THE HOUSE
AROUND MY LITTLE GIRL.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.923
ALL RIGHT,
SO DENISE HAD BOYFRIENDS.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.574
SHE WAS JUST
TRYING TO HURT ME.

19:54.576 --> 19:57.277
THE MECHANIC,
THE BARTENDER, THE DELIVERY GUY.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.380
BUT THAT PREACHER,
HE WAS THE WORST OF THE BUNCH.

20:00.382 --> 20:02.549
HE RUNS SOME HOMELESS
SHELTER UPTOWN.

20:02.551 --> 20:06.687
PREACHER... YOU MEAN THE GUY
FROM THE CHURCH SOUP KITCHEN?

20:06.689 --> 20:08.004
YEAH, THEY WORKED TOGETHER.

20:08.006 --> 20:09.773
CLAIMED THAT THEY WERE
FRIENDS.

20:09.775 --> 20:11.908
[scoffs] I DIDN'T BUY THAT.

20:11.910 --> 20:15.245
SHE HAD TO TAKE A JOB
ALL THE WAY OUT IN THE CITY?

20:15.247 --> 20:17.381
I'M NOT STUPID.
I KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

20:25.573 --> 20:26.807
I DROVE DENISE HOME
A FEW TIMES.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.242
SHE WAS TERRIFIED
OF HER EX.

20:29.244 --> 20:31.745
YOU LOOKED OUT FOR HER?

20:31.747 --> 20:33.947
WELL, WE WERE REALLY
LUCKY TO HAVE DENISE.

20:33.949 --> 20:35.248
SHE WAS A REAL COOK,
YOU KNOW,

20:35.250 --> 20:36.684
NOT JUST A CAN OPENER.

20:36.686 --> 20:38.936
HOW'D YOU FIND HER?

20:38.938 --> 20:40.471
SHE ATTENDED
OUR SISTER CONGREGATION

20:40.473 --> 20:42.038
OUT IN FAR ROCKAWAY.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.407
AND LAST JULY,
WE PLACED A NOTICE

20:44.409 --> 20:46.409
ON THE COMMUNITY
BULLETIN BOARDS,

20:46.411 --> 20:48.512
AND SHE JUST RESPONDED
RIGHT AWAY.

20:50.047 --> 20:53.049
AND HOW LONG AFTER THAT
DID YOU...

20:53.051 --> 20:55.869
YOU KNOW, START
TO DRIVE HER HOME?

20:57.838 --> 20:59.973
I'M SORRY, WHAT...
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

20:59.975 --> 21:02.142
WELL, HER EX-HUSBAND
THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE

21:02.144 --> 21:04.161
SOMETHING GOING ON
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.980
RIGHT. HE'S CRAZY.

21:06.982 --> 21:10.033
I'M JUST...
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

21:10.035 --> 21:13.671
WHY SHE WOULD TAKE A JOB
SUCH A LONG WAY FROM HOME.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.607
FAR ROCKAWAY IS QUITE
A COMMUTE FOR A SINGLE MOTHER.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.342
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD
THE ATTRACTION BE?

21:18.344 --> 21:20.411
LOOK, DENISE WAS ONLY
INTERESTED IN ONE THING.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.746
SHE TOOK THIS JOB BECAUSE
OF HER DAUGHTER, TIFFANY.

21:22.748 --> 21:25.098
I DON'T FOLLOW.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.100
OUR CHURCH IS AFFILIATED
WITH A PRESCHOOL,

21:27.102 --> 21:28.735
CARNEGIE HILL DAY.

21:28.737 --> 21:31.037
AND I PULLED
A LOT OF STRINGS

21:31.039 --> 21:33.306
TO GET HER DAUGHTER
A SCHOLARSHIP SLOT.

21:34.842 --> 21:37.110
THAT'S NOT IN THIS BUILDING,
IS IT?

21:37.112 --> 21:38.945
BECAUSE OF THE HOMELESS.

21:38.947 --> 21:41.314
IT'S A FEW BLOCKS NORTH
OF HERE ON 88TH STREET.

21:43.117 --> 21:45.202
DENISE'S LITTLE GIRL...

21:45.204 --> 21:47.121
WHO'S WATCHING HER NOW?

21:47.123 --> 21:48.354
HER GRANDPARENTS.

21:48.356 --> 21:50.106
WHEN DENISE WAS SHOT,

21:50.108 --> 21:53.143
HER FAMILY PULLED HER DAUGHTER
OUT OF THE SCHOOL.

21:56.230 --> 21:58.165
OKAY. THANK YOU.

22:01.119 --> 22:03.687
SO PALOMA LIVED
ON 88TH STREET.

22:03.689 --> 22:06.890
SHE MOVED THERE SO SHE COULD
WALK HER DAUGHTER TO PRESCHOOL.

22:06.892 --> 22:08.491
SKIP LOWE...
I WONDER WHAT PRESCHOOL

22:08.493 --> 22:11.829
HIS BOY LEO GOES TO.

22:11.831 --> 22:15.265
WE APPLIED TO OVER
12 PRESCHOOLS.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.100
BUT EVEN AT $30,000
A YEAR TUITION,

22:17.102 --> 22:19.720
CARNEGIE HILL DAY
WAS STILL OUR FIRST CHOICE.

22:19.722 --> 22:21.688
AND YOU DIDN'T
GET ACCEPTED.

22:21.690 --> 22:23.323
WE GOT
WAIT-LISTED.

22:23.325 --> 22:25.192
THERE WERE OVER 300 COUPLES
AT THE OPEN HOUSE,

22:25.194 --> 22:28.295
AND THE SCHOOL SAID
AFTER LEGACIES AND SIBLINGS,

22:28.297 --> 22:30.864
THERE'D ONLY BE FIVE SPOTS
LEFT FOR THREE-YEAR-OLDS.

22:30.866 --> 22:34.434
THAT'S WHY LEO IS TAKING
SO MANY CLASSES, ISN'T IT?

22:34.436 --> 22:36.903
THE COMPETITION IS INSANE.

22:36.905 --> 22:39.372
I MEAN, THEY DON'T
JUST SCREEN THE KIDS.

22:39.374 --> 22:41.174
THEY SCREEN
THE FAMILIES TOO.

22:41.176 --> 22:44.511
YOUR HUSBAND...
HE WAS A STOCK ANALYST.

22:44.513 --> 22:46.596
AND YOU'RE THE VP
OF A COMPANY.

22:46.598 --> 22:48.665
I'D THINK THAT YOU'D
HAVE THE RIGHT PEDIGREE.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.434
SO DID WE.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.452
SKIP EVEN MANAGED TO GET
A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION

22:52.454 --> 22:53.720
FROM A BOARD MEMBER.

22:53.722 --> 22:56.023
AND THAT ONLY BUMPED US
TO THE TOP OF THE WAIT LIST.

22:56.025 --> 22:58.458
THE IRONY IS...

22:58.460 --> 23:00.493
WE JUST GOT THIS YESTERDAY.

23:03.430 --> 23:04.731
"WE ARE PLEASED
TO OFFER LEO LOWE

23:04.733 --> 23:07.984
"A PLACE IN OUR
THREES CLASS

23:07.986 --> 23:10.070
FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR
2008."

23:11.656 --> 23:15.726
A WEEK AGO, GETTING IN
WOULD HAVE MEANT EVERYTHING.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.127
BUT WITH SKIP GONE,

23:17.129 --> 23:19.096
LEO AND I ARE GONNA MOVE
CLOSER TO MY PARENTS.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.230
TO GREENWICH.

23:23.434 --> 23:25.769
OF COURSE WE WERE UPSET
ABOUT DENISE MYLER'S DEATH.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.804
HER DAUGHTER IS ON
THE SCHOLARSHIP HERE,

23:27.806 --> 23:29.022
BUT VERY BRIGHT.

23:29.024 --> 23:31.491
AND PALOMA RENZI?

23:31.493 --> 23:33.660
THAT WAS A TRAGEDY.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.129
YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR
OF THE SCHOOL.

23:36.131 --> 23:39.700
YOU HAD TO REALIZE THAT
PARENTS WERE BEING TARGETED.

23:39.702 --> 23:41.635
YOU... YOU DIDN'T
CALL THE POLICE.

23:41.637 --> 23:44.238
TARGETED? WE WERE TOLD
THAT DENISE WAS SHOT

23:44.240 --> 23:46.222
BY HER ESTRANGED HUSBAND

23:46.224 --> 23:48.408
AND PALOMA WAS KILLED
BY A SNIPER IN THE PARK.

23:48.410 --> 23:50.210
AND WHAT ABOUT SKIP LOWE?

23:50.212 --> 23:53.196
I DON'T FOLLOW.
HE'S NOT ONE OF OUR PARENTS.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.482
LEO, HIS SON,
WAS ON THE WAITING LIST

23:55.484 --> 23:57.233
UNTIL SKIP WAS KILLED.

24:00.821 --> 24:02.906
JANINE, CAN YOU
COME IN HERE, PLEASE?

24:02.908 --> 24:04.775
OUR ADMISSIONS
DIRECTOR.

24:04.777 --> 24:09.412
I HAD NO IDEA SKIP LOWE
WAS ON THAT LIST.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.631
YES, I KNEW.

24:11.633 --> 24:14.467
I WAS THE ONE WHO WAIT-LISTED
THE LOWE FAMILY TO BEGIN WITH.

24:14.469 --> 24:17.037
AFTER THE SHOOTING,

24:17.039 --> 24:18.972
YOU DIDN'T TELL
YOUR DIRECTOR.

24:18.974 --> 24:21.541
I DIDN'T WANT
TO ALARM YOU.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.744
THIS IS A VERY
EXCLUSIVE SCHOOL.

24:23.746 --> 24:26.413
I ASSUMED IT HAD TO BE
A TERRIBLE COINCIDENCE.

24:28.199 --> 24:30.167
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SEE
A CLASS LIST

24:30.169 --> 24:31.251
AND YOUR WAITING LIST.

24:31.253 --> 24:32.268
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.571
JANINE,
GET THE LIST.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.344
IF THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE
THAT WE CAN DO...

24:40.346 --> 24:41.678
THERE IS... YOU'LL NEED
TO PUT A FREEZE

24:41.680 --> 24:43.213
ON NEXT YEAR'S ADMISSIONS.

24:43.215 --> 24:47.016
RIGHT NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR WAIT LIST IS A HIT LIST.

24:49.804 --> 24:53.106
THESE ARE THE THREE-YEAR-OLDS
ADMITTED OR WAIT-LISTED

24:53.108 --> 24:56.226
TO CARNEGIE HILL DAY
FOR FALL 2008.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.661
WHEN DENISE MYLER
WAS KILLED,

24:57.663 --> 25:00.797
HER DAUGHTER
TIFFANY MYLER'S SPOT

25:00.799 --> 25:03.232
OPENED UP.

25:03.234 --> 25:04.868
LEO LOWE.

25:04.870 --> 25:07.203
HE WAS ON THE TOP
OF THE WAIT LIST.

25:08.606 --> 25:11.691
AND THEN LEO'S DAD SKIP
WAS KILLED.

25:11.693 --> 25:14.861
NOW, LEO'S MOTHER DECIDED
TO TAKE THEM BACK TO CONNECTICUT

25:14.863 --> 25:16.696
TO THE PARENTS.

25:18.750 --> 25:19.849
THEN PALOMA RENZI WAS SHOT,

25:19.851 --> 25:23.119
SO HER ORPHANED DAUGHTER LILY
WILL BE RAISED BY AN UNCLE

25:23.121 --> 25:24.670
<i>IN CALIFORNIA.</i>

25:24.672 --> 25:26.707
BATTERED WIFE,
SINGLE MOM.

25:26.709 --> 25:29.543
THE DAD LEADING
A DOUBLE LIFE.

25:29.545 --> 25:32.612
THE KILLER, HE'S...

25:32.614 --> 25:35.232
HE'S LOOKING FOR WEAK SPOTS
ON THE LIST.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.700
I FOLLOW YOUR LOGIC.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.302
I JUST FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE
SOMEONE WOULD DO ALL OF THIS

25:39.304 --> 25:40.938
JUST TO GET THEIR KID
INTO PRESCHOOL.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.755
WELL, NOT JUST
ANY PRESCHOOL.

25:42.757 --> 25:44.357
CARNEGIE HILL DAY

25:44.359 --> 25:47.194
IS THE GATEWAY
TO THE IVY LEAGUE.

25:47.196 --> 25:49.596
THESE PARENTS...

25:49.598 --> 25:52.732
THEIR WHOLE SENSE
OF SELF-WORTH RIDES ON THIS.

25:52.734 --> 25:54.100
OKAY, I GET IT.

25:54.102 --> 25:55.735
MY GRANDKIDS
WON'T BE GETTING IN.

25:55.737 --> 25:57.970
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THE FAMILIES ON THE WAIT LIST?

25:57.972 --> 25:59.372
THEY'RE ALL
IN THE BLUE BOOK.

25:59.374 --> 26:02.125
ACTIVE IN CHARITY,
PILLARS OF BUSINESS.

26:02.127 --> 26:03.844
CITIZENS ABOVE SUSPICION.

26:05.213 --> 26:06.713
START SUSPECTING.

26:11.919 --> 26:13.803
CAN I HELP YOU,
DETECTIVES?

26:13.805 --> 26:16.122
OH, MRS. REYNOLDS,
WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR SON

26:16.124 --> 26:17.641
AND DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.960
BRIAN'S AT WORK,
AND MARLA'S AT THE SALON

26:19.962 --> 26:21.094
GETTING HER ROOTS DYED.

26:21.096 --> 26:23.129
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?

26:23.131 --> 26:25.265
YOU JUST BACK
FROM THE PLAYGROUND?

26:25.267 --> 26:27.401
YES. AND I'M EAGER
TO GET HENRY INSIDE.

26:27.403 --> 26:29.602
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK
AFTER 6:00?

26:33.157 --> 26:35.141
HUH. MY KEYS...

26:35.143 --> 26:36.943
THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT HERE.

26:42.383 --> 26:44.167
CAN I HELP YOU,
MRS. REYNOLDS?

26:44.169 --> 26:46.253
YOU CAN HELP ME BY NOT
BLOCKING THE LIGHT.

26:51.375 --> 26:52.125
OH!
[clatter]

26:53.860 --> 26:55.311
OH, DEAR GOD.

27:06.423 --> 27:09.626
WELL, I CERTAINLY DIDN'T
PUT A GUN IN THE CHANGING PAD.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.496
I NEVER DIAPER HENRY
IN PUBLIC.

27:12.498 --> 27:16.366
THEN WHY BRING
THE DIAPER PAD WITH YOU?

27:16.368 --> 27:18.584
YOU KNOW WHO YOU
SHOULD BE TALKING TO?

27:18.586 --> 27:21.354
THE NANNIES
IN THAT PARK.

27:21.356 --> 27:22.989
ALL THEY DO IS SIT
ON THE BENCHES

27:22.991 --> 27:24.190
AND COMPLAIN.

27:24.192 --> 27:25.725
I'LL BET
ONE OF THEM DID IT.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.128
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT,
MRS. REYNOLDS?

27:28.130 --> 27:30.046
THEY KNOW I WATCH THEM.

27:30.048 --> 27:32.115
IF I SEE A NANNY
MISTREAT A CHILD,

27:32.117 --> 27:33.984
I TELL THE PARENTS.

27:35.887 --> 27:37.470
<i>MY SON IS HERE.</i>
<i>MAY I GO NOW?</i>

27:37.472 --> 27:38.904
<i>(Eames) NOT YET.</i>

27:38.906 --> 27:41.874
ANY CHANCE YOU WERE
IN THE PARK LAST SATURDAY

27:41.876 --> 27:43.510
AROUND 8:00 A.M.?

27:43.512 --> 27:45.044
WHEN PALOMA RENZI
WAS KILLED?

27:45.046 --> 27:46.312
OH, YOU KNOW HER.

27:46.314 --> 27:47.931
SHE WAS ALWAYS
IN THE PLAYGROUND

27:47.933 --> 27:50.700
WITH THAT FILTHY DOG.

27:50.702 --> 27:53.302
YOU EVER TALK TO SKIP LOWE
ABOUT THAT?

27:53.304 --> 27:56.006
YOU WERE WITH <i>HIM</i> IN THE PARK
LAST THURSDAY.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.207
ONLY BRIEFLY.
I WENT HOME IN HASTE.

27:58.209 --> 28:00.176
IT WAS PAST
HENRY'S DINNERTIME.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.812
YOUR DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
WILL CONFIRM?

28:06.250 --> 28:08.385
YOU'D TAKE HER WORD
OVER MINE?

28:08.387 --> 28:11.338
BY 7:00, IT'S BATH,

28:11.340 --> 28:13.273
BOOKS, AND BED
FOR HENRY.

28:13.275 --> 28:14.707
EVERY NIGHT.

28:14.709 --> 28:17.143
YOU SEEM...

28:17.145 --> 28:19.912
VER-VERY INVOLVED
WITH HENRY.

28:19.914 --> 28:22.515
EVEN THOUGH
MARLA STAYS AT HOME.

28:22.517 --> 28:25.501
IF I LEFT IT TO HER,
HENRY WOULD EAT POTATO CHIPS

28:25.503 --> 28:27.770
AND WATCH <i>JERRY SPRINGER</i>
ALL DAY.

28:29.590 --> 28:31.707
CARNEGIE HILL DAY.
THAT WAS YOUR IDEA?

28:31.709 --> 28:33.643
ABSOLUTELY.

28:33.645 --> 28:37.580
MARLA WANTED
A CHAIN PRESCHOOL.

28:37.582 --> 28:39.983
<i>THAT'S GLORIFIED DAYCARE.</i>

28:43.320 --> 28:46.355
<i>WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?</i>

28:46.357 --> 28:47.857
WELL, WHERE'S HENRY?

28:47.859 --> 28:50.160
YOU'RE PERSPIRING,
MRS. REYNOLDS.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.862
<i>IT IS WARM IN HERE.</i>
<i>CAN I GET YOU A GLASS OF WATER?</i>

28:52.864 --> 28:54.464
NO. NO WATER.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.700
I NEED TO GET HOME
TO TAKE MY MEDICATION.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.784
IS THAT BLOOD PRESSURE
PILLS?

29:00.454 --> 29:02.222
YES. IT'S <i>URGENT.</i>

29:03.741 --> 29:05.491
YEAH. WE... I...

29:05.493 --> 29:07.877
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE
MUCH LONGER.

29:11.098 --> 29:13.233
I'M AN ARCHITECT.
I'VE NEVER EVEN HELD A GUN.

29:13.235 --> 29:15.602
AND I WAS OUT OF TOWN
ON THURSDAY.

29:15.604 --> 29:17.370
WHAT ABOUT SATURDAY MORNING?

29:17.372 --> 29:19.573
BRIAN WAS HOME WITH ME.

29:19.575 --> 29:21.958
DID YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW
TAKE HENRY OUT?

29:21.960 --> 29:24.577
I'M NOT SURE.

29:25.846 --> 29:28.848
ELEANOR TAKES QUITE
AN INTEREST IN HENRY, HUH?

29:28.850 --> 29:30.867
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A SECOND MOM, REALLY.

29:30.869 --> 29:32.702
SHE'S ALWAYS THERE.

29:36.724 --> 29:39.826
AND SHE WAS THERE, UH,
THURSDAY NIGHT IN THE PARK.

29:39.828 --> 29:41.545
YOU TWO WERE TOGETHER
THE ENTIRE TIME?

29:41.547 --> 29:43.713
THAT'S RIGHT.

29:43.715 --> 29:46.683
OH, MR. REYNOLDS,
YOUR MOTHER SEEMS ANXIOUS.

29:46.685 --> 29:48.734
<i>MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER.</i>

29:48.736 --> 29:50.736
HEY, MARLA,
WHY DON'T YOU CALL

29:50.738 --> 29:52.372
AND CHECK ON HENRY?

29:57.528 --> 29:59.362
<i>BEFORE YOU CHECK THAT,</i>

29:59.364 --> 30:00.446
CAN I JUST ASK YOU
ONE QUESTION?

30:00.448 --> 30:03.316
SO ELEANOR AND YOU
WALKED HENRY HOME?

30:05.936 --> 30:08.404
HENRY WANTED SALMON
FOR DINNER,

30:08.406 --> 30:10.373
BUT I FORGOT TO BUY IT.

30:10.375 --> 30:13.777
SO I TOLD ELEANOR A WHITE LIE
AND RAN TO THE STORE.

30:13.779 --> 30:16.279
AND THE SALMON, THAT WAS
YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW'S IDEA?

30:16.281 --> 30:18.698
I'VE JUST NOTICED
THAT SHE'S PARTICULAR.

30:18.700 --> 30:21.851
SHE JUST WANTS
WHAT'S BEST FOR HENRY.

30:24.237 --> 30:25.571
LIKE CARNEGIE HILL DAY.

30:26.940 --> 30:29.475
SHE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT?

30:29.477 --> 30:31.277
DID SHE TELL YOU
SHE'S MAD AT ME?

30:32.613 --> 30:34.614
ABOUT HIM NOT GETTING IN?
YEAH, IT CAME UP.

30:34.616 --> 30:36.132
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

30:36.134 --> 30:38.868
SHE TOLD ME THEY DIDN'T
WANT SPIRITED BOYS,

30:38.870 --> 30:41.538
SO I LET HENRY RUN AROUND
BEFORE HIS INTERVIEW.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.773
AND BY THE TIME WE GOT THERE,
HE WAS DIRTY,

30:43.775 --> 30:45.374
AND HIS NOSE WAS RUNNING.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.043
WELL, HE IS A KID.

30:47.045 --> 30:48.378
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

30:48.380 --> 30:49.779
SHE WROTE OUR ESSAY,

30:49.781 --> 30:53.266
THE LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR PEOPLE TO SIGN.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.718
SHE HAD IT ALL
FIGURED OUT.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.236
FOR YEARS.

30:56.238 --> 30:59.739
SHE DECIDED HENRY HAD TO GO
THERE BEFORE HE WAS EVEN BORN.

30:59.741 --> 31:01.907
SHE...

31:01.909 --> 31:03.576
[laughs loudly]

31:03.578 --> 31:06.179
LISTEN TO ME
JUST RUNNING ON.

31:06.181 --> 31:08.481
BRIAN TOLD ME
TO CHECK ON HENRY.

31:08.483 --> 31:09.482
SO...

31:09.484 --> 31:11.184
[cell phone beeps]

31:11.186 --> 31:14.187
(Eames) BALLISTICS ARE A
MATCH FOR ALL THREE MURDERS.

31:14.189 --> 31:15.821
THE GUN'S UNREGISTERED.

31:15.823 --> 31:18.458
LAST LEGAL SALE
RECORDED EIGHT YEARS AGO.

31:18.460 --> 31:21.027
WHERE DOES AN UPPER
EAST SIDE DOYENNE

31:21.029 --> 31:23.096
GET AN ILLEGAL HANDGUN?

31:23.098 --> 31:25.965
WELL, SHE WAS QUICK
TO ACCUSE THE NANNIES.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.933
MAYBE SHE BOUGHT IT
FROM ONE OF THEM.

31:27.935 --> 31:30.837
AND SHE HAS NO ALIBI
FOR ANY OF THE THREE SHOOTINGS.

31:30.839 --> 31:32.038
NO, SHE ADMITS
TO BEING IN THE PARK

31:32.040 --> 31:33.372
WHEN SKIP AND PALOMA
WERE KILLED.

31:33.374 --> 31:35.474
AND THE DAY DENISE MYLER
WAS SHOT,

31:35.476 --> 31:37.010
SHE CLAIMS TO BE
HOME ALONE.

31:37.012 --> 31:38.778
EXCEPT WE CHECKED
WITH HER GARAGE.

31:38.780 --> 31:40.113
HER MERCEDES
WAS OUT THAT DAY

31:40.115 --> 31:41.114
FIVE HOURS.

31:41.116 --> 31:43.500
OKAY. MOTIVE.
OPPORTUNITY.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.268
SHE KNEW ABOUT
SKIP AND PALOMA,

31:45.270 --> 31:47.203
BUT HOW WOULD SHE KNOW
THAT DENISE MYLER

31:47.205 --> 31:48.871
WAS A PARENT
AT THAT SCHOOL?

31:48.873 --> 31:50.606
ELEANOR WAS ON A MISSION.

31:50.608 --> 31:53.777
SHE HAD TWO YEARS
TO DO RECONNAISSANCE.

31:53.779 --> 31:55.729
YES, I'M FRIENDS
WITH ELEANOR.

31:55.731 --> 31:59.098
BUT WE MET LONG BEFORE
HER GRANDSON APPLIED.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.351
HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?

32:01.353 --> 32:03.670
SHE ATTENDED
A FUND-RAISER I ORGANIZED

32:03.672 --> 32:06.289
FOR THE CARNEGIE
SPAY NEUTER CLINIC.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.124
WE HIT IT OFF RIGHT AWAY.

32:08.126 --> 32:09.725
SHE'S A REAL DOG PERSON.

32:11.562 --> 32:13.896
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
AWKWARD FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP

32:13.898 --> 32:15.632
WHEN HENRY WAS REJECTED.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.601
WE DON'T USE THAT TERM.

32:18.603 --> 32:23.089
AND ELEANOR UNDERSTANDS
THE COMPLEX ALGORITHM OF MONEY,

32:23.091 --> 32:26.092
SOCIAL STANDING,
FITTING IN.

32:26.094 --> 32:27.327
MM.

32:27.329 --> 32:30.096
SHE EVER ASK YOU WHERE
HENRY WAS ON THE WAIT LIST?

32:30.098 --> 32:31.931
SHE WOULDN'T ABUSE
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

32:31.933 --> 32:33.132
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

32:33.134 --> 32:35.385
I TRIED TO REASSURE HER.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.887
I EXPLAINED SHE WAS COMPETING
WITH LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION

32:37.889 --> 32:40.490
FROM HENRY KISSINGER
AND MAX WRIGHT.

32:40.492 --> 32:43.592
THEN HOW DID
TIFFANY MYLER GET IN?

32:43.594 --> 32:46.062
A GIRL FROM
A TROUBLED HOME?

32:46.064 --> 32:47.914
WELL, I EXPLAINED
OUR COMMITMENT

32:47.916 --> 32:49.916
TO ECONOMIC DIVERSITY.

32:49.918 --> 32:53.720
ELEANOR UNDERSTOOD
COMPLETELY.

32:53.722 --> 32:54.904
YES, I SOUGHT OUT JANINE.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.840
IS IT A CRIME TO WORRY
ABOUT MY GRANDSON'S FUTURE?

32:57.842 --> 32:59.342
IT IS IF YOU SHOOT
THE PARENTS

32:59.344 --> 33:00.676
YOU THINK
ARE STANDING IN THE WAY.

33:00.678 --> 33:03.129
YOU HAVE YOUR NERVE,
YOUNG LADY.

33:03.131 --> 33:05.198
<i>(Whitehall) DETECTIVES,</i>

33:05.200 --> 33:06.865
I'VE KNOWN MRS. REYNOLDS
FOR OVER 30 YEARS.

33:06.867 --> 33:07.866
THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS.

33:07.868 --> 33:09.335
WELL, THIS ISN'T.

33:09.337 --> 33:10.936
IT'S A BALLISTICS REPORT.

33:10.938 --> 33:12.938
THE GUN WE FOUND
IN YOUR CLIENT'S DIAPER BAG

33:12.940 --> 33:15.608
WAS USED
TO KILL ALL THREE VICTIMS.

33:15.610 --> 33:18.211
ANYONE COULD HAVE
PUT THAT GUN THERE.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.645
I TOLD THEM
ABOUT THE NANNIES.

33:19.647 --> 33:21.598
HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO THEM YET?

33:23.633 --> 33:25.935
UM, THE NIGHT
THAT SKIP LOWE WAS KILLED,

33:25.937 --> 33:28.504
WE KNOW THAT YOU WEREN'T
WITH MARLA THE ENTIRE TIME.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.506
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

33:30.508 --> 33:31.941
MARLA?

33:31.943 --> 33:33.876
THAT WOMAN
IS PURE WHITE TRASH.

33:33.878 --> 33:35.644
<i>(Whitehall) ELEANOR.</i>

33:35.646 --> 33:37.847
HOW DID SHE
AND BRIAN MEET?

33:37.849 --> 33:39.415
SHE WAS A COCKTAIL WAITRESS.

33:39.417 --> 33:41.333
SHE TRICKED HIM
INTO MARRYING HER.

33:41.335 --> 33:42.969
<i>(Eames) SHE GOT PREGNANT.</i>

33:42.971 --> 33:46.222
AND NOW I HAVE
HIS BEAUTIFUL GRANDSON

33:46.224 --> 33:48.958
WHO DESERVES EVERY
ADVANTAGE IN THE WORLD.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.911
AND BECAUSE OF HER,
HE CAN'T HAVE THEM.

33:56.533 --> 33:59.502
HOW MUCH LONGER
IS THIS GOING TO TAKE?

34:00.971 --> 34:02.838
CAN I GET YOU
A GLASS OF WATER?

34:02.840 --> 34:05.241
NO. NO.

34:05.243 --> 34:07.910
I NEED TO GO HOME.

34:07.912 --> 34:09.978
WE CAN TAKE A BREAK.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.982
LET'S JUST
GET THIS DONE WITH.

34:15.518 --> 34:18.420
IT'S THE BLOOD PRESSURE
MEDICATION.

34:20.524 --> 34:22.958
THAT MEANS THAT YOU
PROBABLY TAKE DIURETICS.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.098
COULD MY PARTNER SHOW YOU
TO THE LADIES' ROOM?

34:29.583 --> 34:31.768
I NEED TO GO HOME.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.253
NOW.

34:33.255 --> 34:34.719
YEAH.

34:37.274 --> 34:40.059
(Goren) ELEANOR REYNOLDS COULDN'T
HAVE DRIVEN TO FAR ROCKAWAY.

34:40.061 --> 34:41.393
IT'S THREE HOURS
ROUND TRIP.

34:41.395 --> 34:43.462
SHE COULDN'T BE AWAY FROM
HER OWN BATHROOM THAT LONG.

34:43.464 --> 34:45.464
THE PUBLIC RESTROOM
PHOBIA DEFENSE.

34:45.466 --> 34:47.900
MAYBE. IT MEANS
SOMEONE FRAMED HER.

34:47.902 --> 34:50.069
NOT HER SON.
HE'S A MAMA'S BOY.

34:50.071 --> 34:52.237
MARLA LIVES
IN ELEANOR'S HOUSE,

34:52.239 --> 34:54.040
UNDER HER THUMB,
UNDER HER RULES.

34:54.042 --> 34:55.742
MAYBE SHE FOUND
A WAY OUT.

34:55.744 --> 34:59.411
KILLING THREE PEOPLE,
THEN FRAMING YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW?

34:59.413 --> 35:02.014
THE PERFECT CRIME.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.050
MARLA CALLS,
ASKS ME TO COME HOME,

35:04.052 --> 35:05.919
TAKE CARE OF HENRY.

35:05.921 --> 35:08.421
I GET HERE, AND SHE'S LEFT
HENRY ALONE IN HIS CRIB.

35:08.423 --> 35:10.889
AND SHE LEFT THIS NOTE.

35:10.891 --> 35:13.058
SHE'S AT CARNEGIE HILL DAY.

35:13.060 --> 35:14.993
SHE THINKS
THEY'VE ACCEPTED HENRY.

35:17.097 --> 35:19.999
[children's chatter
in background]

35:42.789 --> 35:45.491
CLOSE THE DOOR.
YOU'LL WAKE THEM.

35:51.348 --> 35:54.667
NEVER WAKE
A SLEEPING BABY.

35:57.938 --> 35:59.255
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.

35:59.257 --> 36:00.989
<i>I WON'T.</i>
<i>I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.</i>

36:00.991 --> 36:02.991
YOU DON'T NEED THAT GUN.

36:02.993 --> 36:04.260
<i>YOU DON'T NEED IT.</i>

36:07.130 --> 36:08.898
HENRY'S A GOOD BOY.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.900
HE'LL BE HAPPY HERE.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.951
I'M SURE HE WILL.

36:14.271 --> 36:15.638
AND SUCCESSFUL.

36:16.657 --> 36:18.257
<i>FRIENDS HE MAKES HERE</i>

36:18.259 --> 36:20.643
WILL STAY WITH HIM
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

36:20.645 --> 36:23.946
THAT'S THE CARNEGIE HILL DAY
PROMISE.

36:26.433 --> 36:28.351
I BROUGHT HIS CUBBY BOX.

36:30.904 --> 36:34.123
[child whimpers]

36:34.125 --> 36:36.376
OKAY, JUST WA... LOOK.
YOU'LL WAKE THEM.

36:36.378 --> 36:38.777
WE DON'T WANNA WAKE THE KIDS,
RIGHT?

36:38.779 --> 36:40.079
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

36:40.081 --> 36:41.914
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO TALK
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

36:43.467 --> 36:44.651
<i>(Eames) IT'S OKAY, MARLA.</i>

36:44.653 --> 36:46.402
I CAN WATCH THE KIDS.

36:50.190 --> 36:52.575
OKAY, BUT YOU GO FIRST.

36:52.577 --> 36:53.709
OKAY.

36:55.795 --> 36:57.814
GO ON.
<i>ALL RIGHT.</i>

36:59.049 --> 37:01.150
AND, HONEY, I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN A PRETTY GOOD SHOT.

37:03.787 --> 37:05.905
<i>DETECTIVE, I THINK</i>
<i>YOU KNOW JANINE.</i>

37:05.907 --> 37:07.540
AND THAT'S MISS CHESTNUT.

37:07.542 --> 37:09.625
<i>SHE'S GONNA BE HENRY'S</i>
<i>TEACHER NEXT YEAR.</i>

37:11.594 --> 37:14.463
EAMES, JANINE
AND MISS CHESTNUT ARE IN HERE.

37:14.465 --> 37:16.098
VERY GOOD.

37:18.585 --> 37:20.486
[whispering] COME ON,
IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP.

37:22.306 --> 37:26.392
SO THIS IS GONNA BE HIS...

37:26.394 --> 37:27.960
HIS CLASSROOM, HUH?

37:30.147 --> 37:32.949
OH, YEAH. IT'S GONNA
BE NICE AND BRIGHT IN HERE.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.751
[whispering] SHH, SHH, SHH.
QUICK, QUICK, QUICK.

37:38.438 --> 37:40.106
HE'S GOT HIS CUBBY BOX.

37:40.108 --> 37:42.542
THERE'S... THAT'S
A GOOD PLACE FOR ONE.

37:42.544 --> 37:44.360
IT'S GOOD
THAT IT'S NEAR THE DOOR.

37:44.362 --> 37:45.561
IT'LL BE EASIER FOR...

37:45.563 --> 37:47.263
GET OVER THERE WITH THEM!

37:50.733 --> 37:52.168
OKAY. SO...

37:53.587 --> 37:55.104
<i>GET OVER THERE.</i>

37:57.774 --> 37:59.842
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU.

38:11.872 --> 38:13.873
<i>IS THAT SO HE CAN REMEMBER</i>
<i>YOU DURING THE DAY?</i>

38:13.875 --> 38:16.359
<i>HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.</i>

38:16.361 --> 38:19.195
YOUR PARENTS
MUST BE PROUD.

38:19.197 --> 38:20.846
THEY SPEAK TO HIM
ON THE PHONE,

38:20.848 --> 38:22.448
BUT THEY DON'T REALLY
KNOW HIM.

38:22.450 --> 38:23.782
THEY DON'T VISIT?

38:23.784 --> 38:25.818
ONCE,
FOR HENRY'S CHRISTENING.

38:25.820 --> 38:27.386
BUT THEY DIDN'T
LIKE IT HERE.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.322
IT'S TOO LOUD,
TOO CROWDED.

38:29.324 --> 38:31.257
THEY'RE FROM KENTUCKY.

38:34.277 --> 38:36.712
YOU'RE A LONG WAY FROM HOME.

38:36.714 --> 38:38.764
<i>WHY DID YOU COME HERE?</i>

38:41.201 --> 38:43.219
TO BE A DANCER.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.188
[sobbing]

38:45.190 --> 38:46.822
I HAD FANCY DREAMS.

38:46.824 --> 38:49.892
I ENDED UP WAITING TABLES
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

38:49.894 --> 38:52.528
IT'S A HARD PLACE
TO LIVE.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.731
EVERYONE'S SO BUSY.

38:54.733 --> 38:57.600
NOBODY HAS TIME
TO MAKE A NEW FRIEND.

38:59.002 --> 39:00.035
YEAH.

39:00.037 --> 39:01.404
BUT YOU MET BRIAN.

39:01.406 --> 39:02.571
[laughs]

39:02.573 --> 39:05.340
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA
BE MY PRINCE CHARMING.

39:05.342 --> 39:07.075
BUT HE'S BUSY TOO.

39:07.077 --> 39:09.177
AND HIS FRIENDS,
THEY'RE ALL SO SMART.

39:09.179 --> 39:11.447
I NEVER FINISHED COLLEGE.
I CAN'T KEEP UP.

39:11.449 --> 39:13.833
YOU CAN'T KEEP UP...
BUT YOU'RE SMART TOO.

39:13.835 --> 39:15.835
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE...
GET BACK!

39:15.837 --> 39:17.703
HOW SMART YOU ARE. COME ON!
GET BACK!

39:17.705 --> 39:20.039
OKAY. OKAY.

39:20.041 --> 39:21.106
ALL RIGHT.

39:22.759 --> 39:24.560
DO YOU MEAN THAT?

39:24.562 --> 39:28.096
I DO, YEAH.
I THINK IT'S...

39:28.098 --> 39:29.432
TOUGH FOR YOU.

39:29.434 --> 39:31.967
<i>I KNOW IT MUST BE</i>
<i>DIFFICULT FOR YOU</i>

39:31.969 --> 39:33.752
TO FIND PEOPLE
TO HANG OUT WITH.

39:33.754 --> 39:35.188
WHO DO YOU TALK TO?

39:36.873 --> 39:39.275
I USED TO HAVE FRIENDS
AT THE WOMEN'S RESIDENCE,

39:39.277 --> 39:41.544
BUT ELEANOR DIDN'T LIKE THEM.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.779
NOW I TALK TO HENRY
AND THE NANNIES.

39:43.781 --> 39:45.180
TH-THE NANNIES.

39:45.182 --> 39:48.117
MR. LOWE'S NANNY,
PALOMA'S NANNY.

39:48.119 --> 39:51.320
I SIT ON THE BENCH
NEXT TO THEM, LISTEN IN.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.589
<i>YEAH. I THINK</i>
<i>THAT THEY LIKE YOU.</i>

39:53.591 --> 39:55.658
YOU KNOW?

39:55.660 --> 39:57.977
THEY SAW THE WAY
THAT ELEANOR TREATED YOU.

39:57.979 --> 40:02.281
SHE WAS SO UPSET
WHEN HENRY GOT WAIT-LISTED.

40:03.984 --> 40:06.685
ALL YOU DO
IS TRY AND PLEASE HER.

40:06.687 --> 40:10.589
SHE WOULD BE PROUD
OF YOU NOW BECAUSE...

40:10.591 --> 40:12.024
HENRY GOT IN.

40:17.047 --> 40:19.348
IT'S MY FAULT
HE DIDN'T GET IN.

40:19.350 --> 40:23.419
ELEANOR'S RIGHT.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.955
I CAN'T GIVE HENRY
WHAT HE NEEDS.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.257
HE'S BETTER OFF
WITHOUT ME.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.076
NO, NO, NO, SHE'S WRONG!
HEY!

40:30.078 --> 40:31.810
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT
HE NEEDS,

40:31.812 --> 40:33.112
YOU KNOW WHAT HE LIKES.

40:33.114 --> 40:34.780
I'VE SEEN YOU WITH HIM.

40:34.782 --> 40:37.616
HIS EYES, THEY LIGHT UP
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND.

40:38.919 --> 40:42.254
HOW CAN ELEANOR LOVE HENRY
AND NOT LOVE ME?

40:42.256 --> 40:44.423
I MADE HIM.

40:44.425 --> 40:45.974
LOOK, IT'S BEEN TOUGH
FOR YOU, OKAY?

40:45.976 --> 40:49.394
ALL YOU'VE WANTED TO DO
IS BE A GOOD MOM.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.651
NO, DON'T DO THAT.
YOU'RE IRREPLACEABLE!

40:55.653 --> 40:58.787
YOU'RE HIS MOTHER.
HE NEEDS YOU.

41:02.809 --> 41:05.645
HE NEEDS YOU, MARLA.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME THE GUN.

41:11.717 --> 41:13.652
YOU GOTTA GIVE ME THE GUN.

41:29.336 --> 41:30.269
OKAY.

41:36.810 --> 41:38.610
I'M IRREPLACEABLE.

41:40.997 --> 41:42.398
YEAH.

41:50.273 --> 41:52.107
OW!
CLEAR!

41:54.444 --> 41:56.312
MARLA REYNOLDS,

42:03.371 --> 42:05.070
