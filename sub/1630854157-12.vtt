00:38.539 --> 00:40.447
we have to pretend
your dad's annoying habits

00:40.541 --> 00:42.099

00:42.117 --> 00:44.768
Here it comes, we get to watch
him remove his mouth guard.

00:44.787 --> 00:45.878
Good morning, family.

00:46.105 --> 00:47.287
Let's see if I can break

00:47.439 --> 00:49.631
the nine-inch saliva
string record.

00:52.127 --> 00:53.944
There it is, nine inches.

00:54.113 --> 00:55.462
Peter, that's two inches.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.222
Saliva starts
at the taint, Lois.

-Thank you.

BRIAN:
Mmm. (moans with pleasure)

01:06.625 --> 01:08.625
Happy Father's Day, Dad.

Okay, Peter, we have a special
present for you this year.

01:41.418 --> 01:44.103

a scavenger hunt would be fun.

01:44.330 --> 01:46.271
Dads don't want fun

They want to put
their hand down their pants,

01:48.334 --> 01:50.109

from a weird country

01:50.260 --> 01:51.735

Hey, Lois, can my friend
stay over tonight?

09:21.895 --> 09:22.877
LOIS:
What? Who?

09:22.971 --> 09:24.211
PETER:
My cowboy friend.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.622
-LOIS: No.
-Please?

09:25.640 --> 09:28.141
LOIS:
No. You can't keep
coming home with things.

09:28.293 --> 09:29.793
-PETER: I don't.
-LOIS: This is
the iguana all over again.

09:29.811 --> 09:31.552
-This isn't the iguana.
-I always end up

09:31.646 --> 09:32.979
-having to take care of them.
-His skin is very
similar to the iguana,

09:33.131 --> 09:34.964
-but it's not the iguana.
-No.

09:34.983 --> 09:37.133
PETER:
Please? I think
we could have fun.

09:37.226 --> 09:38.484
LOIS:
I don't care what you think.

09:38.579 --> 09:39.803
The answer is no.

09:39.896 --> 09:41.154
PETER:
It's not fair. Please?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.081
LOIS:
I said, "No."

09:43.917 --> 09:46.293
She said backyard's fine.

09:49.756 --> 09:50.922
Now, I have to say,

09:51.074 --> 09:52.482
I was a little hesitant
to let you stay here,

09:52.500 --> 09:54.926
but you've been a very
considerate guest.

09:55.078 --> 09:57.320
Every time
I stand up, you stand,

09:57.339 --> 09:59.264
take your hat off,
and say, "Ma'am."

09:59.415 --> 10:01.141
-Ma'am.
-(Lois chuckles)

10:02.251 --> 10:03.560
-Ma'am.
-(Lois chuckles)

10:04.587 --> 10:05.604
Ma...

10:05.680 --> 10:06.846
-...am.
-(Lois chuckles)

10:06.940 --> 10:08.331
You know, I can't understand

10:08.350 --> 10:10.516
why Mayor West wouldn't
want you in his life.

10:10.669 --> 10:13.670
-It's a long story.
-STEWIE: How long?

10:13.688 --> 10:15.021
My daddy was an outlaw,

10:15.173 --> 10:17.765
just like his daddy,
and his daddy before him.

10:17.859 --> 10:19.618
STEWIE:
"The end." Not so long.

10:19.769 --> 10:21.936
They raised me to be the same.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.271
<i> After Wild was born, I...</i>

10:24.291 --> 10:25.624
<i> I tried getting honest work.</i>

10:25.792 --> 10:27.033
<i> Tried to go straight.</i>

10:27.185 --> 10:29.961
<i> I auditioned for</i>
America's Got Talent,

10:30.113 --> 10:30.962
<i> but no one appreciates</i>
<i> jumping in and out</i>

10:31.114 --> 10:32.872
<i> of a spinning lasso anymore.</i>

10:33.024 --> 10:34.374
<i> When that didn't work out,</i>

10:34.542 --> 10:35.783
<i> I turned to</i>
<i> the only life I knew:</i>

10:35.877 --> 10:37.527
<i> robbing and stealing.</i>

10:37.545 --> 10:39.195
(horse whinnies)

10:40.198 --> 10:42.599
<i> Wild never forgave me</i>
<i> for abandoning him.</i>

10:44.035 --> 10:45.718
How'd you get that
scar on your face?

10:45.812 --> 10:48.204
I got this scar working a heist.

10:48.223 --> 10:50.815
A member of my posse
got pinned down by gunfire

10:50.967 --> 10:52.208
and I went back to save him.

10:52.301 --> 10:53.393
When you work a job
with someone,

10:53.487 --> 10:55.654
you never leave
another man behind.

10:55.805 --> 10:57.063
You know what I think?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.824
With a little domestication,
you'd make a good dad.

10:59.976 --> 11:00.900
Why don't you stay with us

11:00.994 --> 11:02.735
and I can help you
win your son back?

11:02.829 --> 11:04.311
Oh, that sounds swell.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.207
Mind if I shoot my pistol
in the air to celebrate?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.593
(exhales)

11:10.595 --> 11:13.746
Oh, boy, this is gonna turn
into a mess on Nextdoor.

11:13.899 --> 11:15.006
(chimes)

11:17.752 --> 11:18.760
(chimes)

11:19.754 --> 11:21.054
(chimes)

11:21.907 --> 11:23.056
(chimes)

11:23.909 --> 11:25.058
(chimes)

11:25.927 --> 11:27.310
(chimes)

11:34.586 --> 11:37.028
(chiming)

11:46.355 --> 11:48.873
Are you sure this whole getup
is necessary, Peter?

11:49.025 --> 11:50.116
I feel a little foolish.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.101
It's the perfect dad uniform.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.694
The free Marriott polo shirt

11:53.772 --> 11:56.122
tells everyone that you're
handsy when you're drunk,

11:56.274 --> 11:57.698
the jean shorts
say you're impotent,

11:57.718 --> 12:00.126
and the sunglasses say
you stormed the Capitol.

12:00.295 --> 12:02.369
That was a peaceful protest.

12:02.464 --> 12:04.948
Yeah, it's not like they were
kneeling at a football game.

12:05.041 --> 12:06.391
On a Sunday.

12:06.542 --> 12:09.452
Anyway, now you look like a man
who's ready to be a dad.

12:09.545 --> 12:11.287
In fact,
my son was having a problem

12:11.306 --> 12:13.714
that maybe a good dad
could help him solve.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.233
There's a girl I like at school,

12:15.310 --> 12:17.961
and I'm not sure
if she likes me back.

12:17.979 --> 12:19.312
Now here's what you should do:

12:19.464 --> 12:21.314
You take out
a hefty silver dollar,

12:21.466 --> 12:22.966
and you drop it
in her corset.

12:22.984 --> 12:25.301
If it's meant to be,
she'll accept you

12:25.320 --> 12:27.971
in a room full of
distractingly floral wallpaper.

12:28.064 --> 12:29.730
If not,
she'll stab you in the liver

12:29.750 --> 12:30.749
with your own boot knife.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.126
That's how I met my Pearl.

12:35.571 --> 12:37.088
I think you're ready.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.498
When Mayor West sees you now,

12:38.650 --> 12:41.167
he's gonna know you're serious
about being his dad.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.002
Thank you
for all your help, Peter.

12:43.171 --> 12:44.912
You make a good partner,

12:44.931 --> 12:45.930
and I want you
to have something.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.490
It's the dried hand

12:47.492 --> 12:49.267
of a Paiute
I found in the desert.

12:49.418 --> 12:51.010
It's very important to me,

12:51.104 --> 12:52.604
and now it's yours.

12:52.755 --> 12:56.265
Is-is this a way to break
some kind of curse on you?

12:57.335 --> 12:59.335
You need to make
the decision to take it.

12:59.428 --> 13:01.521
Yeah, m-maybe just
leave it on the ground.

13:01.673 --> 13:02.596
It doesn't work like...

13:02.690 --> 13:04.765
It'll just wind up
back in my pocket.

13:04.785 --> 13:05.842
Yeah, I'm gonna pass.

13:05.860 --> 13:07.601
Well, looks like someone thinks

13:07.695 --> 13:10.771
a shave and a haircut
means he's a changed man.

13:10.791 --> 13:15.018
Son, I don't know how much time
I have left in this world.

13:15.036 --> 13:16.686
Because of the cursed hand?

13:16.704 --> 13:18.296
That does add to the stress.

13:18.523 --> 13:20.965
I just want to make things
right between us.

13:21.117 --> 13:22.133
I don't buy it,

13:22.360 --> 13:23.450
and I'm gonna do to you

13:23.470 --> 13:25.695
what should have been done
a long time ago.

13:25.697 --> 13:26.696
(whistles)

13:26.698 --> 13:28.031
(guns cocking)

13:28.124 --> 13:30.383
You're under arrest
for shooting the mayor.

13:30.535 --> 13:31.476
You ambushed me.

13:31.703 --> 13:34.813
A real man is always
ready for an ambush.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.557
And a man also knows
how to get out of an ambush.

13:37.709 --> 13:39.108
(whistles)

13:44.049 --> 13:45.139
Hmm.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.141
(video game
gunshots and screams)

13:47.235 --> 13:48.642
Don't you have to work today?

13:48.736 --> 13:50.219
No, I work on Thursday.

13:50.238 --> 13:52.646
Uh, dude? Today is Thursday.

13:52.666 --> 13:53.665
Dang it.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.421
(hoofbeats receding)

14:02.158 --> 14:04.133
Forgot my phone.

14:10.925 --> 14:12.241
(siren wailing)

14:12.260 --> 14:14.410
I should have never
listened to you, Peter.

14:14.429 --> 14:16.855
If I had my gun,
I would have gotten out of this.

14:17.082 --> 14:18.264
I was only trying to help.

14:18.416 --> 14:19.673
You want to help?

14:19.693 --> 14:22.176
Take this Paiute hand
and put it in a safe place.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.011
Oh, okay, yeah, I can...
Oh, wait a minute.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.865
And I reckon you're pretty
happy with yourself,

14:27.092 --> 14:28.867
getting your father
arrested like this.

14:29.018 --> 14:30.869
I reckon you have
no right to reckon about

14:31.020 --> 14:32.762
what I'm reckoning about.

14:32.780 --> 14:34.430
That's where you're wrong.

14:34.449 --> 14:37.283
I reckon I can reckon about
what I reckon please.

14:37.435 --> 14:39.118
I reckon you should
check yourself

14:39.212 --> 14:40.712
before you reckon yourself.

14:40.863 --> 14:44.549
I reckon you know I always
come in like a reckon ball.

14:44.700 --> 14:45.775
That Miley?

14:45.868 --> 14:47.201
I reckon it is.

14:47.295 --> 14:49.387
I don't agree with
all the piercings and haircuts,

14:49.614 --> 14:51.781
but she's got
one hell of a voice.

14:51.874 --> 14:53.349
A hell of a voice.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.561
Joe, you can't arrest him.

14:56.712 --> 14:58.045
He shot the mayor, Peter.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.547
Plus, he's got multiple
warrants in multiple states.

15:00.716 --> 15:03.693
Yeah, I know, he really
messed up. Like David Geffen.

15:06.814 --> 15:08.055
What the hell was that?

15:08.149 --> 15:09.908
Yeah, David Geffen
paid us $10 million

15:10.059 --> 15:10.909
not to do the cutaway.

15:11.060 --> 15:12.468
Huh. Was it bad?

15:12.561 --> 15:14.412
I'm not allowed to say
as part of the settlement.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.582
All I will say is from film,
to music, to politics,

15:17.733 --> 15:21.628
no one has been more influential
than David Geffen.

15:24.666 --> 15:25.982
What's the matter, Peter?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.833
Ah, I don't know,
I just feel bad

15:27.986 --> 15:29.168
about what happened
with Old West.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.836
It's my fault he got arrested.

15:30.989 --> 15:32.430
He's probably gonna die in jail

15:32.581 --> 15:34.265
without ever
making up with his son.

15:34.417 --> 15:36.417
Well, I know how painful it is

15:36.511 --> 15:39.178
to see a man you've known
for 18 hours in distress,

15:39.330 --> 15:41.013
but you've got
to let it go, Peter.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.516
I can't do that.
Old West and I were partners,

15:43.610 --> 15:46.169
and he taught me that when
you work a job with someone,

15:46.187 --> 15:48.262
you never leave a man behind.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.840
We got to form a posse
and break him out.

15:50.858 --> 15:52.617
-I'm in.
-Let's do this.

15:52.844 --> 15:55.695
-Yeah.
-ANNOUNCER: Next up
for Clam Karaoke Night:

15:55.789 --> 15:56.955
it's the "Glam Guys."

15:57.182 --> 15:58.957
All right,
let's go rock Wilson Phillips

15:59.184 --> 16:01.000
and then do the posse thing.

16:04.522 --> 16:05.538
Where's your horse?

16:05.632 --> 16:08.282
It's very hard to get
a horse last-minute.

16:08.376 --> 16:09.375
You should have called
last night.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.694
I did.
You all got the last horses.

16:11.713 --> 16:13.972
The guy was totally
overwhelmed on the phone.

16:14.123 --> 16:16.057
He yelled at me.

16:17.368 --> 16:18.643
All right, Peter,
what's the plan?

16:18.794 --> 16:20.703
I thought you guys
were gonna have the plan.

16:20.722 --> 16:21.813
I formed the posse.

16:21.964 --> 16:23.206
Yeah, those usually go together.

16:23.224 --> 16:24.207
All right, let's brainstorm.

16:24.267 --> 16:25.483
How do we fool the police

16:25.634 --> 16:27.735
into breaking someone
out of a jail cell?

16:29.063 --> 16:30.488
Trojan Bosch.

16:33.384 --> 16:37.328
Oh, no way, Harry Bosch.
My favorite TV cop.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.738
I have so many
questions for you.

16:38.890 --> 16:41.648
How's L.A.? You ever
meet Richard Dean Anderson?

16:41.743 --> 16:43.409
He lives in L.A., right?
Where does he live?

16:43.561 --> 16:45.670
Um, hey, settle
a bet for me, Bosch.

16:45.821 --> 16:47.839
In all those scenes where
you're in Italian restaurants,

16:48.066 --> 16:50.399
is it true
you're eating real spaghetti?

16:50.493 --> 16:51.400
PETER:
Shut up.

16:51.419 --> 16:52.510
I knew it was real spaghetti.

16:52.737 --> 16:54.328
All right, I'm gonna go
get us some coffees.

16:54.405 --> 16:56.072
You mind holding down
the fort for a sec?

16:56.090 --> 16:57.573
Thanks, Bosch.

16:57.592 --> 16:59.242
Real spaghetti. Wow.

16:59.244 --> 17:02.169
PETER:
He's gone. Everybody out
the black jeans door.

17:02.247 --> 17:05.081
Straight flush.
You got to strip.

17:05.099 --> 17:07.266
PETER:
What about tonight?

17:07.418 --> 17:08.601
What?

17:08.695 --> 17:10.920
Oh, did you say, "I'm never
gonna get out of here?"

17:10.938 --> 17:13.606
No, I was telling
my horse to get naked.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.926
Oh. Oh, well-well,
we're breaking you out tonight.

17:17.019 --> 17:19.095
I'm surprised
you came back for me.

17:19.188 --> 17:21.855
You taught me to never
leave another man behind.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.524
I didn't think you'd remember.

17:23.601 --> 17:26.711
I associate you with guns,
guns make me think of war,

17:26.862 --> 17:27.937
Vietnam was a war,

17:28.030 --> 17:30.439
and N.A.M.
is "Never Abandon Man."

17:30.458 --> 17:32.592
I-I don't need
to hear the process.

17:33.628 --> 17:35.294
Allen, you came.

17:35.446 --> 17:36.445
Of course I did.

17:36.464 --> 17:38.872
And I think margs
are gonna be on you

17:38.892 --> 17:40.224
after this adventure, huh?

17:40.451 --> 17:41.967
I don't drink that (bleep).

17:42.062 --> 17:43.561
Okay, we'll
figure something out.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.063
Everyone wanted to help.

17:45.214 --> 17:47.565
We even got a member of
your original posse to show up.

17:48.793 --> 17:50.418
The Melanoma Kid.

17:50.478 --> 17:52.219
(through electrolarynx):
I wouldn't miss it...

17:52.313 --> 17:53.571
(gasps)

17:53.722 --> 17:54.964
...for the world.

17:55.057 --> 17:56.074
That's a guy?

17:56.301 --> 17:57.983
I thought it was
a big autumn leaf.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.244
