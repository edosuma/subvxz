WEBVTT

00:17.951 --> 00:19.985
Dandy:
Bette?

00:19.987 --> 00:21.020
Dot?

00:21.022 --> 00:22.955
Here you are.

00:22.957 --> 00:25.290
You have a visitor.

00:25.292 --> 00:27.559
This young man was concerned
about your welfare.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.994
As you can see,

00:28.996 --> 00:30.562
Bette and dot
aren't prisoners,

00:30.564 --> 00:31.864
They're
our guests.

00:31.866 --> 00:34.299
They can leave
anytime they want.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.635
Is that true?

00:36.637 --> 00:38.871
We're being treated
very well, jimmy.

00:38.873 --> 00:40.672
Gloria:
When the girls first
stepped foot in our house,

00:40.674 --> 00:42.674
They were malnourished,
both body and soul.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.676
A daily regimen of
vitamins and foie gras

00:44.678 --> 00:46.245
Brought the pink
back to their pallor.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.647
Bette, dot, I
know this seems

00:48.649 --> 00:50.649
Like the life of riley now,
but trust me,

00:50.651 --> 00:51.750
This is no place for you.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.018
Because
to them,

00:53.020 --> 00:54.686
You're nothing more
than a curiosity.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.089
A freak
to gawk at.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.390
So what do you
want us to do?

00:58.392 --> 00:59.858
Go back to
the show?

00:59.860 --> 01:00.993
How is that any different?

01:00.995 --> 01:02.561
Jimmy:
Because you'd have

01:02.563 --> 01:04.596
A whole community of
people to protect you.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.031
Gloria:
Why would we harm

01:06.033 --> 01:07.166
A hair on
their heads?

01:07.168 --> 01:08.767
We paid good money
for these girls.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.002
Dandy:
Mother's right.

01:10.004 --> 01:11.036
Don't listen to a word.

01:11.038 --> 01:13.605
Everything he says
is a lie.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.174
Bette:
Jimmy, you told us

01:15.176 --> 01:17.876
You saved those kids
from the killer clown.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.445
It was dandy.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.281
He was there when
you were unconscious.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.349
He's the real hero.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.289
Dandy:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

01:30.291 --> 01:32.291
I've always wondered

01:32.293 --> 01:34.960
How this trick was done.
Haven't you?

01:34.962 --> 01:36.462
Leave her alone!

01:36.464 --> 01:38.030
Bette...

01:38.032 --> 01:39.765
Dot...

01:40.900 --> 01:42.101
...You have to come with me.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.236
Now.
Dandy:
You don't give

01:44.238 --> 01:45.704
The orders
in this house.

01:46.706 --> 01:48.140
Dot,

01:48.142 --> 01:50.075
I know you have
mixed feelings.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.878
You're thinking of
getting the surgery,
which I'll never allow.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.080
'cause you'd never cut a girl
in half, would you, dandy?

01:55.082 --> 01:57.449
Shut up!
Stop trying to ruin everything!

01:58.651 --> 02:01.220
How do you know, dandy?

02:02.822 --> 02:04.323
About the surgery?

02:04.325 --> 02:08.193
I told you there will be
no secrets between us.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.196
You read my diary.

02:12.999 --> 02:15.767
I want to leave.

02:15.769 --> 02:16.935
She can't leave
without bette.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.170
We're in love,

02:18.172 --> 02:20.105
And love trumps everything.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.007
Jimmy:
Well, your mother said

02:22.009 --> 02:23.242
The girls could go
any time they want.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.476
Let's let them decide.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.080
Bette,

02:28.082 --> 02:29.948
I know you love me.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.250
Tell them

02:31.252 --> 02:32.985
You want to stay

02:32.987 --> 02:35.120
And live forever
in luxury with me.
(laughs)

02:35.122 --> 02:38.090
Dot:
<i>There's something wrong</i>
<i>with dandy and you know it.</i>

02:43.596 --> 02:45.497
I'm sorry.

02:46.966 --> 02:49.801
But I choose my sister,

02:49.803 --> 02:51.970
Always.

02:51.972 --> 02:55.073
We have to go.

04:26.065 --> 04:27.065
Jimmy:
<i>Testing.</i>

04:27.067 --> 04:29.568
<i>Okay, let's do this.</i>

04:29.570 --> 04:31.970
<i>One, two, three.</i>

04:31.972 --> 04:35.540
(playing nirvana's
"come as you are")

04:48.955 --> 04:51.390
¶ come as you are

04:51.392 --> 04:53.592
¶ as you were

04:53.594 --> 04:58.096
¶ as I want you to be

04:58.098 --> 05:02.567
¶ as a friend, as a friend

05:02.569 --> 05:05.003
¶ as an old enemy

05:05.005 --> 05:07.973
¶ take your time

05:07.975 --> 05:09.775
¶ hurry up

05:09.777 --> 05:11.510
¶ the choice is yours

05:11.512 --> 05:13.912
¶ don't be late

05:13.914 --> 05:15.347
¶ take a rest

05:15.349 --> 05:17.416
¶ as a friend

05:17.418 --> 05:23.922
¶ as an old memory...

05:23.924 --> 05:27.259
¶ memory, ah

05:28.261 --> 05:31.763
¶ memory, ah

05:33.333 --> 05:36.335
¶ well, I swear

05:36.337 --> 05:39.771
¶ that I don't have a gun

05:39.773 --> 05:43.442
¶ no, I don't have a gun

05:45.044 --> 05:47.279
¶

05:51.684 --> 05:53.018
Hey, uh...

05:53.020 --> 05:54.286
You seen
andy around?

05:54.288 --> 05:56.188
Not since the last time
you came by looking.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.625
Never fall in love with
a hustler. That's my advice.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.694
¶ memory, ah

06:03.830 --> 06:06.932
¶ memory, ah

06:07.967 --> 06:10.068
You keep your mouth shut!

06:14.040 --> 06:16.041
¶ and I swear

06:16.043 --> 06:21.046
¶ that I don't have a gun

06:24.083 --> 06:28.987
¶ memory, ah.

06:30.923 --> 06:33.492
(microphone whining)

06:40.032 --> 06:41.566
Truthfully? Adequate.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.068
Jimmy:
I'm not changing anything.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.237
That's the song,
that's how I'm doing it.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.772
Tonight.
Mid-show number.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.440
Ha!

06:48.442 --> 06:50.041
Do you honestly believe

06:50.043 --> 06:51.943
That I would allow you

06:51.945 --> 06:54.546
To sap the energy
of the audience? Huh?

06:54.548 --> 06:56.448
Remember to whom you speak.

06:56.450 --> 06:59.484
I know exactly
who I'm talking to!

07:02.889 --> 07:04.122
A liar.

07:04.124 --> 07:07.626
And we don't take
orders from liars.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.432
What's going on here, huh?
What is this?

07:13.434 --> 07:14.933
The twins,
elsa.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.268
We know what you
did with the twins.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.636
They ran off!

07:17.638 --> 07:18.970
I told you that.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.505
Yeah, we heard
your story.

07:21.974 --> 07:24.042
Maybe it's time
we heard theirs.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.110
What?

07:28.548 --> 07:31.883
You sold
them off.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.251
Like pets.

07:33.253 --> 07:36.154
That's not quite how
it happened, actually...

07:36.156 --> 07:37.556
Bette
<i>what are you doing?</i>

07:37.558 --> 07:38.490
Dot:
<i>Keep it buttoned.</i>

07:38.492 --> 07:39.558
<i>I know what I'm doing.</i>

07:41.127 --> 07:44.229
It's true miss elsa
took us to dandy mott,

07:44.231 --> 07:45.831
But only because I asked her to.

07:45.833 --> 07:46.965
But you said
that...

07:46.967 --> 07:48.133
Well, you misunderstood.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.702
Miss elsa
didn't sell us.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.872
She helped us.

07:55.508 --> 07:59.144
We wanted to experience
the finer things in life.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.846
And elsa

08:00.848 --> 08:03.114
Was kind enough
to make that happen.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.817
But she also said we
always had a home here,

08:05.819 --> 08:07.219
If that's what
we wanted.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.088
So we've decided to come home.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.326
If you'll have us.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.428
Well, of course, my darlings.

08:16.430 --> 08:18.697
Anything
you want.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.978
Desiree:
<i>Miss ethel,</i>

08:32.980 --> 08:34.379
We'll get this
taken care of.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.214
Don't you worry about me.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.016
The good doctor's
gonna fix me up,

08:38.018 --> 08:40.819
Right as rain.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.154
You be sure and
book your surgery.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.557
Desiree: Oh, I will.
I can hardly wait.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.232
"closed for
business"?

08:54.234 --> 08:57.269
What on earth?

09:15.021 --> 09:17.589
(door opens)

09:17.591 --> 09:19.391
Where's dr.
Bonham?

09:19.393 --> 09:22.027
He's dead.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.162
Oh, no...

09:24.164 --> 09:25.597
Spare me
the theatrics.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.332
I'm not a fan of yours.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.334
Well, you're a very
rude young woman.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.769
Who are you?

09:30.771 --> 09:31.703
I'm his daughter.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.004
Oh, you're the one

09:33.006 --> 09:34.005
He moved down here for?

09:34.007 --> 09:36.074
No.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.375
I'm the other one.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.544
The one without
a husband and children.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.880
I came down from boston
to bury him.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.949
What happened to him?

09:43.951 --> 09:46.117
You killed him!

09:46.119 --> 09:47.919
Your very existence

09:47.921 --> 09:50.188
Challenged his beliefs
in god and science.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.591
So before he blew
his brains out,

09:52.593 --> 09:54.960
He took a hammer and
smashed both of his hands.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.461
The hands of a surgeon.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.930
They were his most
valuable possession.
Oh, god...

09:58.932 --> 10:01.199
What am I gonna do now?

10:01.201 --> 10:04.069
You're gonna get out, before
I call the cops.
Oh, come...
Just a minute...

10:04.071 --> 10:05.337
Get out, you freaks!

10:10.276 --> 10:12.744
Oh, ho, ho! Okay.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.779
Whoa...

10:16.616 --> 10:18.683
(chuckles)

10:21.320 --> 10:23.455
Huh.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.390
(grunts)

10:27.126 --> 10:29.995
Hey, it's the strong man.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.396
I keep trying
with this thing

10:31.398 --> 10:33.131
And I can't even
get it halfway up.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.966
I feel like
a damn fairy.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.968
Hey, don't be cute, buddy.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.137
I'm in the mood
to hurt someone today,

10:39.139 --> 10:41.506
And trust me, you don't
want it to be you.
What's the matter?

10:41.508 --> 10:44.042
You can't actually
get it up?

10:53.352 --> 10:55.487
(bell dings)

10:57.023 --> 10:58.490
Well, I'll be.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.959
Say, what do you say we go
get a drink and you, uh,

11:00.961 --> 11:02.427
You tell me
your trick?

11:02.429 --> 11:04.462
I know this place a
couple of towns over

11:04.464 --> 11:06.531
Called, uh...
High noon.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.467
What?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.670
Oh! You-you haven't
heard of it?

11:11.672 --> 11:15.173
Why, that's funny, because
I saw you there today.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.642
And so did a lot of
other people, I'm sure.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.844
You were pretty upset
about one of those,

11:19.846 --> 11:23.682
Uh, sweet little things
that works there.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.050
Maggie:
What's going on, fellas?

11:27.219 --> 11:29.120
Kind of hard
to hit the bell

11:29.122 --> 11:30.789
When richard's in
your way, isn't it?

11:30.791 --> 11:33.091
You might
hit him instead.

11:35.194 --> 11:39.164
Ah, these things are
rigged anyway, right?

11:39.166 --> 11:42.067
Dell and I are gonna
head into the tent
to chat, instead.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.436
You got it.

11:47.907 --> 11:50.575
Rule number one.

11:50.577 --> 11:53.878
When attempting to blackmail
a man with freakish strength

11:53.880 --> 11:55.980
And a mean streak the
size of the panhandle,

11:55.982 --> 11:57.449
Make sure you
got witnesses.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.829
Stanley:
You're my ideal man.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.864
And I'm not talking about
your bulging muscles.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.566
Though I have
to admit--

12:14.568 --> 12:17.235
For someone so strong, you
lack the beefcake look.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.671
No.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.740
You have the three qualities
I love in a person.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.708
One-- you lack a moral code.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.177
Two-- you can kill a man
with your bare hands.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.079
And three-- you have
to do whatever I say,

12:28.081 --> 12:29.914
Or I'm gonna make sure
this whole place knows

12:29.916 --> 12:32.350
That you have someone else's
shit under your fingernails.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.952
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.220
Not now, you won't.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.255
Maggie saw us
come in here.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.090
And not later.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.892
'cause I'm very good
with this thing.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.261
I like to aim
for the jewels.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.130
Kind of my
signature shot.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.698
The screams of the men
who have been nut-shot

12:46.700 --> 12:48.032
Are so specific.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.902
Came here to make a deal, right?

12:50.904 --> 12:52.971
Talk.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.048
I need one of your freaks.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.650
Dead.

13:05.652 --> 13:08.920
Keep it clean, I want
the body intact.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.990
And it needs to look like
they just disappeared.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.563
You want me to kill
one of my own?

13:18.565 --> 13:21.199
I weep from your sudden
sentimentality.

13:26.939 --> 13:31.176
There's a barn a couple of miles
due west of here.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.178
Bring the body there.

13:37.449 --> 13:38.950
You've got a day.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.019
(whistles casually)

13:43.789 --> 13:46.024
Maggie:
<i>What's on your mind?</i>

13:46.026 --> 13:49.027
You're a million miles
away tonight.
(doo-wop song plays)

13:49.029 --> 13:50.995
I was just thinking
about the twins.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.764
How they changed
their story.

13:52.766 --> 13:55.767
Made me look like a fool
in front of everybody.

13:55.769 --> 13:57.769
Maybe they got confused.

13:57.771 --> 14:01.172
No, there's something weird
going on around here.

14:01.174 --> 14:05.176
I don't know what, but it's
got my head all screwed up.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.045
Maybe it's
another sign.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.446
That it's time
for us to go.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.616
We could leave right now,
before the sun comes up.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.952
Unless you changed
your mind...

14:13.954 --> 14:15.954
No, of course not.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.488
I'll go with you.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.857
Then let's go.

14:18.859 --> 14:19.991
Right now.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.025
I can't right now.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.461
It doesn't feel right.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.163
That rich kid,

14:25.165 --> 14:28.833
You should have seen the way
he was looking at the twins.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.835
And that second clown--

14:30.837 --> 14:34.239
Do you think you would recognize
his voice if you heard it?

14:34.241 --> 14:35.807
I-I don't know.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.709
He was... He was wearing
that mask.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.011
And it's over.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.246
Why does it matter?

14:41.248 --> 14:44.015
Because justice
is justice.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.017
That guy almost
sawed you in half.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.319
If the rich kid did
it, he has to pay.

14:50.256 --> 14:52.257
You know
what I think?

14:52.259 --> 14:54.259
You're stalling.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.261
No, I'm not.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.263
I want to go.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.032
I just need a few more days
to get everything in order.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.034
That's bullshit.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.036
You're never gonna
leave this place.

15:05.038 --> 15:08.039
¶ you knew when you loved me

15:08.041 --> 15:12.343
¶ I never would resist...

15:26.125 --> 15:28.192
¶

15:50.082 --> 15:53.051
¶ I never would resist...

15:55.087 --> 15:57.655
You trying
to get with me?

15:58.924 --> 16:01.492
¶ I'll give in...

16:01.494 --> 16:03.494
Don't make this difficult now.

16:03.496 --> 16:04.629
(screams)
goddamn it!

16:05.965 --> 16:09.100
¶ my only sin

16:09.102 --> 16:11.736
¶ but the same guided missiles

16:11.738 --> 16:17.175
¶ will get you in the end...

16:20.012 --> 16:21.479
(screams)

16:21.481 --> 16:23.481
All right, all right,
uncle, uncle.

16:23.483 --> 16:27.251
¶ but the same guided missiles

16:27.253 --> 16:33.257
¶ will get you in the...

16:33.259 --> 16:36.194
¶ end.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.329
Who's the strong man now?

16:47.272 --> 16:48.940
Amazon eve:
And all I can think about is

16:48.942 --> 16:50.341
His grubby hands
all over me.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.776
(groans)

16:51.778 --> 16:53.478
No, keep your
hand on ice.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.847
Your swelling will
never go down.
Ugh.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.449
Dell's done a lot
of rotten things, but this?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.885
He must be out
of his mind.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.053
We got to get
our facts straight,

17:02.055 --> 17:02.987
So when we go to the cops...

17:02.989 --> 17:05.456
Cops?

17:05.458 --> 17:07.458
You of all people saying that.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.694
Dell is our problem;
we're gonna fix it.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.964
We're gonna sneak into
his trailer, kill him.

17:12.966 --> 17:14.399
What?! Whoa, whoa!

17:14.401 --> 17:15.867
Ma, where's this coming from?

17:15.869 --> 17:17.568
I know him, jimmy.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.170
I know what
he's capable of.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.405
And you don't.

17:20.407 --> 17:23.007
Jesus, ma, well,
at least let me talk to him.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.542
Amazon eve: What if
he'd come after maggie?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.911
You'd be the first one
charging in with a gun.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.479
Suzi: You don't know
what it's like,

17:28.481 --> 17:30.148
Peepers flipping up our skirts.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.916
Ethel: You know what
your problem is, jimmy?

17:31.918 --> 17:34.018
You're stuck on the rosy notion

17:34.020 --> 17:37.021
That the world operates
on goodness,

17:37.023 --> 17:39.323
Decency.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.325
Truth is--

17:41.327 --> 17:43.327
All goodness guarantees ya...

17:43.329 --> 17:46.130
Is an early grave.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.035
But the biggest joke of all--

17:51.037 --> 17:54.105
The thing that'll sink ya
every time...

17:56.041 --> 17:58.109
...Is hope.

18:01.180 --> 18:05.116
Hope that the world
will right itself.

18:05.118 --> 18:09.187
That the just will be rewarded
and the wicked punished.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.093
Oh, once you buy into
that horseshit,

18:15.095 --> 18:17.195
You're dead in the water.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.398
The only way to survive

18:20.400 --> 18:23.668
In this disgusting
godforsaken world...

18:25.604 --> 18:27.605
...Is to take control.

18:27.607 --> 18:31.609
Ain't nobody gonna take
care of our people but us.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.811
Dell hurt one
of our own,

18:33.813 --> 18:36.881
We can't let him
get away with that.

18:38.317 --> 18:41.319
Can't let...

18:41.321 --> 18:44.388
That degenerate prick win.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.925
He's got to pay.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.927
He will, ma, he will.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.497
I can make it right.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.165
I'll kick his ass to the curb,
I'll tell him

18:54.167 --> 18:56.134
To get the hell out of here,
never come back.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.136
Trust me.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.204
I can handle dell.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.641
You handle him.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.312
Or we will.

19:11.183 --> 19:12.750
(bell clangs)

19:12.752 --> 19:14.185
See that?

19:14.187 --> 19:16.053
Easy-peasy-japanesey.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.327
Sweet holy jesus, ralph.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.929
You only got
halfway up there.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.164
(laughing): I-I've
seen nine-year-old girls

19:26.166 --> 19:29.867
In pigtails hit it
higher than that.

19:33.705 --> 19:35.873
Jimmy: I've got
to talk to you.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.375
Man to man.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.311
Well, tell me when
the other man shows up,

19:40.313 --> 19:41.512
And I'll talk to him.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.347
Funny. Not here.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.654
All right.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.156
Let's go into town.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.558
I'll let you buy me a drink.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.537
So, tell me--

20:06.539 --> 20:10.074
What do you girls
want in exchange

20:10.076 --> 20:14.312
For that charming tale
about my kindness?

20:14.314 --> 20:17.415
You want me
to stay here

20:17.417 --> 20:19.717
And not compete
with your hollywood, uh,

20:19.719 --> 20:22.486
Siamese twins floor wax hour?

20:22.488 --> 20:24.655
We're not going
to hollywood.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.257
We don't trust
richard spencer.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.092
Why take a chance
on a stranger

20:28.094 --> 20:30.194
When we have all
we need right here?

20:30.196 --> 20:31.495
Hmm, so that's all you want?

20:31.497 --> 20:32.830
To stay here?

20:32.832 --> 20:35.967
Just tell her
what you told me.

20:40.205 --> 20:41.706
<i>Go on.</i>

20:41.708 --> 20:44.108
I want to become a comedienne.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.110
Like eve arden. And
I could crack jokes

20:46.112 --> 20:48.045
And tell
stories

20:48.047 --> 20:50.581
In between songs.
Oh, and I want caviar

20:50.583 --> 20:54.118
For breakfast. And I want
to dye my hair blonde.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.686
<i>And 20.</i>

20:55.688 --> 20:58.055
And 20% of the box office.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.690
Off
the top.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.693
You can have it.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.428
Once I'm in hollywood.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.797
We want the money now.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.199
And we also want
the money

21:08.201 --> 21:10.067
That gloria gave you
when you sold us.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.070
(chuckles)

21:13.072 --> 21:16.107
This is blackmail.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.576
My, my, my.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.578
You girls have come a long way

21:20.580 --> 21:23.180
Since I've rescued you
from the hospital.

21:24.716 --> 21:26.784
What about you, dot?

21:26.786 --> 21:29.120
Hmm?

21:30.122 --> 21:32.757
You're very quiet.

21:32.759 --> 21:36.627
Do you condone
this... Outrageous behavior?

21:37.896 --> 21:41.899
In fact,
I think we should take 50%

21:41.901 --> 21:43.334
Of the
box office.

21:43.336 --> 21:48.472
¶ you're mine

21:48.474 --> 21:49.774
¶ and we belong...

21:49.776 --> 21:52.576
(groaning)

21:52.578 --> 21:55.346
Jesus, what the hell
was that, gasoline?

21:55.348 --> 21:56.914
(chuckles)

21:56.916 --> 21:59.150
It tastes like piss
on fire,

21:59.152 --> 22:00.951
But it's cheap. It'll get you
drunk twice as fast.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.586
Let's have another one.

22:02.588 --> 22:04.955
One's good for me.
I don't do liquor.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.957
I seen what it did to my ma.

22:06.959 --> 22:10.494
I'm scared, once I start,
I won't be able to stop.
Come on.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.264
You're not gonna become a drunk
in one night. It doesn't work

22:13.266 --> 22:16.167
That way.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.269
(sighs)
fine. You want
to talk? Talk.

22:18.271 --> 22:21.806
Fine. I don't know what happened
between you and amazon eve,

22:21.808 --> 22:23.674
But they're putting together
a lynch mob to string you up

22:23.676 --> 22:25.843
By your balls.
That woman is nuts.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.645
I mean, I just went
in there to...

22:27.647 --> 22:30.014
Talk to her
about maybe doing a little...

22:30.016 --> 22:33.017
Strong man and strong woman act
in the show.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.986
I didn't get one word out,
and she's smashing me
over the head with a frying pan.

22:35.988 --> 22:40.024
That's not what she says.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.093
Hey, just leave
the bottle here.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.063
What are you,
a mama's boy?

22:46.065 --> 22:49.200
We're supposed to have
a man-to-man.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.568
Well, men drink.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.575
Attaboy.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.076
(sighs)
(coughs)

22:59.078 --> 23:01.078
She can say whatever she wants.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.047
Look at her. Look at me.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.882
Who got
the worst of it?

23:04.884 --> 23:07.084
It doesn't matter
who's telling the truth.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.153
Those gals are gonna
mess you up.
(chuckles)

23:09.155 --> 23:11.555
Yeah.
You and me are no friends
to each other,

23:11.557 --> 23:13.924
And I'm not gonna miss you
when you're gone,
no matter how you go,

23:13.926 --> 23:17.528
But we've had enough
trouble already this year.

23:17.530 --> 23:22.933
¶ and we belong together

23:24.536 --> 23:30.908
¶ yes, we belong together

23:30.910 --> 23:32.343
¶ ah-ah-ah-ah

23:32.345 --> 23:36.113
¶ for all eternity...

23:36.115 --> 23:39.817
¶ <i>eternity</i> ¶

23:42.120 --> 23:45.423
¶ you're mine...

23:45.425 --> 23:47.057
You must sweat like a
thoroughbred with those.

23:47.059 --> 23:49.126
(coughs)

23:50.295 --> 23:52.096
Yeah, but it's worth it

23:52.098 --> 23:53.898
To be able to be
out here in the world.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.099
Living a life,
talking to girls...

23:55.101 --> 23:57.234
I guess it...

23:57.236 --> 23:59.036
It would be nice not
to have to wear them.

24:01.740 --> 24:02.940
I remember this one time,

24:02.942 --> 24:06.043
We were camping up
in wisconsin all summer.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.778
Yeah, and things were
going pretty good,

24:07.780 --> 24:10.047
So elsa extended our stay
into the fall.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.783
But when she did that,

24:12.785 --> 24:15.453
Our winter spot
down in tampa fell through

24:15.455 --> 24:19.123
And we had to ride out the whole
winter up there in the cold.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.958
It was fun at first,
'cause most of those guys

24:20.960 --> 24:23.127
Had never seen
snow before, but...

24:23.129 --> 24:24.762
By January, everybody was
shitting their pants

24:24.764 --> 24:27.298
From the cold.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.733
I went out hunting and...

24:29.735 --> 24:30.968
Shot a rabbit.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.571
Skinned it for a coat
for ma petite.

24:36.775 --> 24:39.743
You ever see those pictures
in <i>life</i> magazines

24:39.745 --> 24:42.313
Of the african tribal warriors
where the...

24:42.315 --> 24:44.515
Where the whole head
and the skin of a...

24:44.517 --> 24:46.250
A lion,
like a cloak?

24:46.252 --> 24:49.019
That's what ma petite
looked like.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.187
Except...

24:52.157 --> 24:53.824
...Except it was
with a rabbit head.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.025
(chuckles)

24:55.027 --> 24:57.628
(laughs)

24:57.630 --> 24:59.129
I can see it.

24:59.131 --> 25:02.032
I can
see that.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.502
Man, I love that little broad.

25:07.138 --> 25:09.707
Anyway...

25:09.709 --> 25:12.142
Those were the best
few months of my life,

25:12.144 --> 25:15.446
Because I was
just a guy wearing gloves.

25:15.448 --> 25:19.517
Just like every other guy.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.285
Least I could
pretend I was, you know?

25:25.657 --> 25:27.992
Give me the gloves.

25:27.994 --> 25:32.930
¶ and we belong together

25:34.866 --> 25:40.738
¶ yes, we belong together...

25:40.740 --> 25:42.873
You got nothing
to be ashamed of.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.909
If anyone looks
at you funny,

25:44.911 --> 25:46.377
I'll break
their skulls.

25:51.182 --> 25:53.250
Ah.

25:55.654 --> 25:57.388
Unless it's a girl, right?

25:57.390 --> 26:01.225
(both laugh)

26:01.227 --> 26:04.161
Unless it's a girl.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.230
(coughs, laughs)

26:12.837 --> 26:15.039
I don't feel good.
I think

26:15.041 --> 26:16.907
I got to go.

26:21.046 --> 26:23.480
(coughing)

26:28.286 --> 26:30.888
Oh.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.756
(spits, groans)

26:32.758 --> 26:34.925
(splashing)

26:34.927 --> 26:36.760
(heaves, coughing)

26:45.303 --> 26:47.938
(quiet moaning)

26:47.940 --> 26:50.774
I...

26:50.776 --> 26:52.476
I know who you are.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.383
I always known.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.922
Hell, just the way
mama hates you

27:04.924 --> 27:06.256
Tells me everything
I need to know.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.759
But I got proof.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.761
I asked some of the old-timers,

27:10.763 --> 27:13.731
The ones that have been around
since methuselah was a kid.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.334
They told me
about your dad

27:17.336 --> 27:20.070
And your brothers.

27:20.072 --> 27:23.841
The famous toledo
lobster clan.

27:32.250 --> 27:35.986
I don't know why you
don't got 'em. (sniffles)

27:38.023 --> 27:39.490
But you gave me these.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.199
But I want to hear you say it.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.668
(sniffles)

27:50.670 --> 27:52.736
You're my father.

27:56.975 --> 27:58.542
Say it.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.010
Tell me.

28:01.446 --> 28:03.047
Come on,
say it, dad.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.382
You're my dad.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.851
Please, come on, ans...

28:07.853 --> 28:09.820
Answer me.

28:09.822 --> 28:13.123
Come on.
Come on.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.491
Yes, son.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.560
It's true.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.150
You got to go, dad.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.219
They're gonna kill you.

28:44.656 --> 28:46.523
It's okay.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.258
I'll figure something out.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.327
Yeah.

28:52.163 --> 28:55.032
Let's get you home.

28:55.034 --> 28:58.936
Come on, now.
Let's go home.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.004
Come on.

29:14.619 --> 29:17.621
¶ have you heard about
the big strong man? ¶
¶ strong man

29:17.623 --> 29:19.923
¶ well, he lived
in a caravan ¶
¶ a caravan!

29:19.925 --> 29:22.860
¶ have you heard about the
jeffrey johnson fight? ¶
(rooster cries)

29:22.862 --> 29:24.962
¶ oh, what a hell
of a fight ¶

29:24.964 --> 29:27.631
¶ you can take all
the heavyweights you got ¶
that's right!

29:27.633 --> 29:30.033
¶ we've got a lad
who can beat the whole lot ¶

29:30.035 --> 29:31.935
¶ sylvest'
hey, what do you got?

29:31.937 --> 29:34.037
¶ he got a row of 40 medals
on his chest ¶

29:34.039 --> 29:36.774
Big chest!
Big chest!
Hey!

29:36.776 --> 29:38.609
You two are drunk.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.544
I won't have you
wake up the entire camp

29:40.546 --> 29:41.945
With your
caterwauling.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.882
Too late for that.
Jimmy,

29:44.884 --> 29:48.152
Don't let that man
corrupt you with his

29:48.154 --> 29:50.087
Bad habits.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.655
You still got time
to be somebody.

29:51.657 --> 29:53.290
Aw, he is somebody.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.992
He's my son.

29:58.930 --> 30:01.431
Thought I wouldn't go through
with that, did you, dessi?

30:01.433 --> 30:02.966
But I'm proud to admit it.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.169
Jimmy's my son!
Yeah!

30:05.171 --> 30:06.804
Wow.

30:06.806 --> 30:09.973
Congratulations, huh?

30:09.975 --> 30:12.176
Must have taken
real courage

30:12.178 --> 30:15.779
To finally proclaim your progeny
after 24 years.

30:15.781 --> 30:18.148
Why don't you two go to bed
and sleep it off.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.783
You know, jimmy,

30:19.785 --> 30:22.152
This is the perfect time

30:22.154 --> 30:25.155
For me to tell you something
that my father told me.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.824
What?

30:26.826 --> 30:29.760
It's the toledo code.

30:29.762 --> 30:33.096
The first minute you let
a woman tell you what to do

30:33.098 --> 30:37.100
Is the first minute
you hand your balls to 'em.

30:37.102 --> 30:38.602
I want to
keep my balls.

30:38.604 --> 30:41.772
You hold on to them, son.

30:41.774 --> 30:43.707
Things are gonna change
around here, elsa.

30:43.709 --> 30:47.144
No more
bossing us around, okay?

30:47.146 --> 30:49.546
You got two strong bulls here
ready to run this whole joint.

30:49.548 --> 30:50.981
That's right.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.517
(grunts)
ow.
(laughing)

30:55.119 --> 30:57.187
Idiots.

30:59.057 --> 31:00.457
Come on,
come on.
(groans)

31:00.459 --> 31:03.360
Sing something else.
Sing it!
Shh.

31:03.362 --> 31:06.129
Shh, shh.
Sing it, baby!

31:06.131 --> 31:07.531
Sing it.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.799
Go.

31:08.801 --> 31:11.668
Shh, quiet, elsa.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.237
Shh... You'll wake
everybody up.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.339
You don't want
to wake anybody.

31:15.341 --> 31:16.540
Shh.
Shh!

31:16.542 --> 31:18.075
Quiet!

31:20.645 --> 31:21.979
Too loud.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.381
Shh.
(laughs) shh.

31:24.383 --> 31:28.085
Be quiet,
elsa! Quiet.

31:28.087 --> 31:32.089
So loud. Ha.
Step up. All right.

31:32.091 --> 31:37.094
(mumbling)
you're all right.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.830
Oh. (exhales)

31:39.832 --> 31:41.531
Oh.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.600
I'm gonna say something
I never said before

31:43.602 --> 31:46.169
In my whole life.

31:47.338 --> 31:48.972
Good night, dad.

31:50.842 --> 31:54.778
Do you say good night
when it's the morning?

32:01.119 --> 32:03.921
Good night, son.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.757
Sleep tight.

32:10.862 --> 32:13.130
Queer...

32:13.132 --> 32:15.098
Isn't it?

32:15.100 --> 32:16.466
How the first cigarette
in the morning

32:16.468 --> 32:18.802
Is the best smoke all day.

32:18.804 --> 32:20.337
You trying to be funny?

32:21.606 --> 32:24.942
No.

32:24.944 --> 32:27.010
But you are trying
my patience.

32:33.384 --> 32:37.154
Man:
All you've got right
now is that box?

32:49.133 --> 32:51.401
Vince:
Were you there again?

32:51.403 --> 32:53.170
With him?

32:57.108 --> 32:59.009
Yes.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.345
And I'm going back. For good.
I just came home to pack.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.946
You're gonna have to kill me
to stop me.

33:02.948 --> 33:05.749
(quiet scoff)
you think I wouldn't?

33:05.751 --> 33:07.985
I'm your only child. The only
record of your sorry life

33:07.987 --> 33:09.987
Once you're gone.
You're too vain to picture

33:09.989 --> 33:11.855
A world without
a piece of you in it.

33:13.925 --> 33:16.159
I think you mistake
my pride for vanity.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.595
I'm an
electrician.

33:18.597 --> 33:21.031
Strangers welcome me
into their homes

33:21.033 --> 33:23.333
And leave me there
alone to ply my trade.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.469
A man like me is dead

33:25.471 --> 33:27.938
If he doesn't come
with a sterling reputation.

33:27.940 --> 33:31.041
You are
my blood,

33:31.043 --> 33:34.044
But if you do something
to shame me,

33:34.046 --> 33:36.947
To shame this family,

33:36.949 --> 33:38.648
I will do
whatever it takes

33:38.650 --> 33:41.785
To make sure no one ever
knows you belonged to me.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.854
Well...

33:46.024 --> 33:49.026
...Prepare for the shaming
of your life,

33:49.028 --> 33:50.961
Because I am in love with paul

33:50.963 --> 33:54.498
And I'm gonna go live with him
and his kind and I'm

33:54.500 --> 33:56.566
Gonna tell anybody
that will listen to me

33:56.568 --> 33:58.969
Who I am and who my daddy is
and that I chose

33:58.971 --> 34:00.904
To be one of the outcasts,
because anything

34:00.906 --> 34:02.239
Is better than living
with the evil

34:02.241 --> 34:04.207
That lives
in this house.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.343
You think a father doesn't
know what his daughter's

34:06.345 --> 34:07.978
Gonna do before she does it?

34:07.980 --> 34:11.214
I know I can't stop you.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.985
And I'm not a
murderer. But...

34:14.987 --> 34:16.987
I did invite
my friend morris over

34:16.989 --> 34:18.355
To give you a proper send-off.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.891
Who the hell is morris?

34:20.893 --> 34:22.959
Morris is an artist.

34:35.106 --> 34:36.573
Dot?

34:36.575 --> 34:37.741
Oh. (coughs)

34:37.743 --> 34:40.010
Who do I remind you of?

34:40.012 --> 34:42.345
Mother. She wore the same shade

34:42.347 --> 34:43.380
Of lipstick.

34:43.382 --> 34:46.850
I bear a striking resemblance

34:46.852 --> 34:48.685
To eve arden.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.687
She was nominated
for an academy award

34:50.689 --> 34:53.523
For <i>mildred pierce.</i> Do
you remember that movie?

34:53.525 --> 34:57.094
"loving her was like shaking
hands with the devil."

34:57.096 --> 34:58.528
Dot:
<i>Speaking of which...</i>

34:58.530 --> 35:03.033
Well, look at my beautiful girl.

35:03.035 --> 35:04.468
Gladys,
you are a true artist.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.470
Bette has been transformed
from a

35:06.472 --> 35:08.772
Caterpillar into
a butterfly.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.041
Careful-- I am still here.

35:11.043 --> 35:13.376
Gladys:
This is a first for me.

35:13.378 --> 35:15.045
I've worked on lots of gals
with double chins,

35:15.047 --> 35:17.380
But never one with two heads.

35:17.382 --> 35:18.949
But I don't judge--

35:18.951 --> 35:20.951
Every client is
different. Dot...

35:20.953 --> 35:22.252
Sure you don't want me
to give you a little touch-up?

35:22.254 --> 35:23.620
(sighs)

35:23.622 --> 35:25.255
I am happy being
the caterpillar.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.490
Thank you.

35:26.492 --> 35:29.126
Dot, look in the mirror.

35:29.128 --> 35:31.928
We make the perfect

35:31.930 --> 35:33.396
Before and after picture.

35:33.398 --> 35:36.099
It can be our new act.

35:36.101 --> 35:39.002
We'll call it
"the metamorphosis."

35:39.004 --> 35:40.604
Elsa,

35:40.606 --> 35:44.174
You can be the fairy godmother
who grants the wish

35:44.176 --> 35:46.009
Of the plain jane--
that's dot--

35:46.011 --> 35:48.111
And transforms her into
the epitome of glamour.

35:48.113 --> 35:50.313
That's me.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.416
Well, how kind of you to include
me in your number, huh?

35:53.418 --> 35:55.118
Oh, you wave the wand,
that's all you do.

35:55.120 --> 35:58.088
Well, I'll go to work on it
right away.

35:58.090 --> 36:01.191
Let me know if there's anything
else you might want.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.528
I'm making a list.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.997
Oh...

36:06.999 --> 36:10.133
Gladys, I think the hair
is too poofy on that side.

36:10.135 --> 36:12.903
Don't push too hard now.

36:28.286 --> 36:30.020
Elsa:
<i>"my dear dot.</i>

36:30.022 --> 36:33.523
"you hardly said a word
during our negotiation,

36:33.525 --> 36:37.160
"until you demanded
your 50%.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.863
"what would you want

36:39.865 --> 36:41.831
"a bigger tent?

36:41.833 --> 36:43.533
"a new car?

36:43.535 --> 36:46.469
"just tell me
your heart's desire.

36:46.471 --> 36:49.673
"you can trust me

36:49.675 --> 36:52.509
"we are in this together.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.110
Elsa."

36:57.181 --> 36:59.983
(gentle melody plays)

36:59.985 --> 37:01.384
(singsongy):
Miss elsa?

37:01.386 --> 37:03.320
What do you want, <i>liebchen?</i>

37:04.889 --> 37:05.922
Here, darling.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.058
Make mama another one, okay?

37:08.060 --> 37:09.326
(kisses)

37:09.328 --> 37:10.860
The usual.

37:10.862 --> 37:15.031
¶ doesn't shine for us all

37:15.033 --> 37:18.835
¶ always remember

Dot:
"yes. I want something.

37:21.073 --> 37:22.939
"there's a doctor in chicago

37:22.941 --> 37:24.908

37:50.602 --> 37:52.269
Morris:
Well, I have to be.

37:52.271 --> 37:55.705
There can be no mistakes.

37:55.707 --> 37:59.276
You see, human skin
is a delicate canvas.

37:59.278 --> 38:02.912
Uneven, textured,

38:02.914 --> 38:04.781
Sometimes scarred.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.384
(needle buzzing)
and she...

38:07.386 --> 38:09.085
She is my masterpiece.

38:09.087 --> 38:11.388
And she's waking up.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.556
Where's a mirror?
Right there.

38:13.558 --> 38:16.826
I want to see the look
on her face.

38:20.097 --> 38:23.600
¶ penny, penny,
open your eyes ¶

38:23.602 --> 38:26.636
¶ daddy's got a
big surprise. ¶

38:26.638 --> 38:29.172
Penny (whining):
Daddy, it hurts.

38:29.174 --> 38:31.007
(crying):
It hurts.

38:31.009 --> 38:34.210
Beauty is painful, sweetheart.

38:36.847 --> 38:38.448
(screaming)

38:38.450 --> 38:40.016
Vince: Stick out your tongue.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.085
(laughing)
I had it forked.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.019
(screaming)

38:51.028 --> 38:52.162
¶

38:52.164 --> 38:53.997
Stanley:
So...

38:53.999 --> 38:55.799
It's true what they say.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.901
Stars really don't eat.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.339
Okay, so let's get down
to business.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.841
I have a problem.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.876
A serious situation.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.144
The twins are back.

39:08.146 --> 39:11.281
Not only are they back,
but they are

39:11.283 --> 39:13.116
Hell-bent on destroying me.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.887
Now, little miss sour face--

39:17.889 --> 39:20.156
That's dot...
Ah.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.225
...She wants to locate

39:22.227 --> 39:25.128
A doctor in chicago

39:25.130 --> 39:27.063
Whom she believes

39:27.065 --> 39:30.467
Can perform some
hideous operation.

39:30.469 --> 39:34.571
What I want to do is have
you locate this doctor

39:34.573 --> 39:37.640
And then we could send
them up to chicago.

39:37.642 --> 39:39.743
They will be out of my life,

39:39.745 --> 39:42.645
Off my back forever.

39:42.647 --> 39:44.013
Do you, uh...

39:44.015 --> 39:47.050
Oh, no, go ahead.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.017
Please, be my guest.

39:48.019 --> 39:50.720
(grunts)

39:50.722 --> 39:52.155
Just mulling.

39:52.157 --> 39:55.225
This is good brain food,
red meat.

39:55.227 --> 39:57.227
(growls)

40:02.933 --> 40:05.502
I don't know.

40:07.171 --> 40:08.938
Perhaps rather than
some medical calamity,

40:08.940 --> 40:10.373
Which they believe
is going to relieve them

40:10.375 --> 40:11.941
Of their psychic pain,

40:11.943 --> 40:15.512
Something more simple
and less public.

40:15.514 --> 40:18.515
Maybe life holds too much pain

40:18.517 --> 40:20.083
And tragedy
for those poor girls.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.085
Wouldn't it be a better solution

40:22.087 --> 40:25.054
If they could be quietly
and easily relieved

40:25.056 --> 40:26.523
Of their misery?

40:26.525 --> 40:28.057
What are you saying?

40:28.059 --> 40:29.559
You know...

40:29.561 --> 40:32.061
A mercy killing.
(sharp laugh)

40:32.063 --> 40:34.431
Those poor things.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.299
(laughs)

40:36.301 --> 40:37.934
Oh, that's quite a solution.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.203
Yeah.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.441
Did you know they killed
their mother?

40:44.443 --> 40:46.743
(grunts)
and then one of them

40:46.745 --> 40:48.478
Tried to kill the other.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.046
I forget which is which--
the two...

40:50.048 --> 40:51.848
Ethel:
Dessert time.

40:53.384 --> 40:55.952
My layered strawberry
and lime jell-o mold

40:55.954 --> 40:57.987
With marshmallows
and fruit cocktail.

40:57.989 --> 41:00.290
I'll put it right over here.

41:00.292 --> 41:02.325
You guys can serve yourselves.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.093
Can I get rid of some of this?

41:04.095 --> 41:06.463
Um...

41:06.465 --> 41:08.731
You're a regular betty crocker,
ethel.

41:08.733 --> 41:10.633
You're too kind.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.735
Enjoy.

41:14.738 --> 41:17.173
(grunts)

41:23.013 --> 41:25.014
Well...

41:25.016 --> 41:27.417
Anyway.

41:27.419 --> 41:29.919
(short laugh)

41:31.822 --> 41:34.157
You know...

41:34.159 --> 41:36.960
I have heard about managers

41:36.962 --> 41:40.096
Who would kill
for their clients.

41:41.131 --> 41:44.167
Looks like I found one. Hmm?

41:44.169 --> 41:46.703
(laughing)

42:00.451 --> 42:02.819
(quietly): Ma petite.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.587
Ma petite.

42:08.459 --> 42:10.527
For you.

42:10.529 --> 42:13.229
Would you like me
to open it?

42:22.339 --> 42:24.140
(gasps)

42:24.142 --> 42:25.675
Pretty.

42:25.677 --> 42:29.913
I can't wait to try it on.

42:29.915 --> 42:31.714
(chuckles softly)

42:52.036 --> 42:54.170
Zip me.

43:03.347 --> 43:05.214
Gorgeous.

43:05.216 --> 43:06.583
Like a little princess.

43:06.585 --> 43:09.319
Thank you.

43:17.061 --> 43:19.028
(bones crunching,
ma petite whimpering)

43:19.030 --> 43:20.063
Shh...

43:20.065 --> 43:22.198
(muffled shouting)
shh...

43:22.200 --> 43:24.100
It's going to be all right.

43:24.102 --> 43:26.002
(muffled screams)

43:26.937 --> 43:29.305
(bones crunching)

43:29.307 --> 43:30.707
(muffled screaming)

43:30.709 --> 43:32.976
(screaming stops)

43:36.480 --> 43:39.649
(sighs)

43:41.151 --> 43:43.353
(quietly):
I'm sorry.

43:50.394 --> 43:52.962
(creaking)

43:55.065 --> 43:56.666
(creaking continues)

43:56.668 --> 43:58.167
(yells)

44:00.671 --> 44:02.472
Hello?

44:02.474 --> 44:04.641
Who's there?

44:05.809 --> 44:07.510
Show yourself.

44:07.512 --> 44:10.146
Now!

44:21.992 --> 44:23.693
Penny.

44:27.631 --> 44:30.033
Oh, god.

44:30.035 --> 44:32.035
This is my fault.

44:33.203 --> 44:34.837
What have I done?

44:34.839 --> 44:37.106
Oh.

44:37.108 --> 44:39.108
(crying)

44:43.047 --> 44:45.415
(low conversations)

44:51.155 --> 44:52.955
(glass clinking)

44:52.957 --> 44:56.025
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.795
Our esteemed board members

44:58.797 --> 45:02.065
And our renowned faculty.

45:02.067 --> 45:06.135
Tonight, we are proud to unveil
the museum's latest acquisition.

45:06.137 --> 45:08.071
A most rare specimen.

45:08.073 --> 45:10.807
And while it did cost
a pretty penny,

45:10.809 --> 45:12.575
We trust that this new exhibit

45:12.577 --> 45:16.345
Will bring <i>thousands</i>
<i>of visitors</i>

45:16.347 --> 45:18.081
From around the globe.

45:18.083 --> 45:20.083
Behold.

45:20.085 --> 45:21.851
Mahadevi patel.

45:21.853 --> 45:24.153
(partygoers gasping)

45:24.155 --> 45:27.156
The smallest woman
in the world.

45:27.158 --> 45:29.225
(murmuring)

45:32.529 --> 45:35.231
