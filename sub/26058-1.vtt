Hey, Mom.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.883
I'm not in Berkeley.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.919
What?
   What are you talking about?

02:01.021 --> 02:02.621
I thought your new job
         started today.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.792
Change of plans.

02:08.929 --> 02:09.862
[chuckles]

02:09.964 --> 02:12.564
So, what are you up to?

02:14.268 --> 02:15.267
Surprise!

02:16.003 --> 02:18.237
Oh, my God!

02:18.339 --> 02:19.905
What are you doing here?

02:20.007 --> 02:23.108
I'm crawling back home
  with my tail between my legs.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.410
What? What happened?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.613
There is no new job.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.349
Budget cuts at the university.
    I got the call yesterday.

02:30.451 --> 02:33.252
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.386
Well, aren't you happy
           to see me?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.921
Are you kidding?

02:36.023 --> 02:38.924
-Christmas in July!
          -Okay, okay.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.392
Don't suffocate me.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.727
I have been driving all night.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.428
I probably smell
     like a homeless person.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.698
Yeah. [chuckles]

02:46.800 --> 02:49.034
You look great, Mom.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.103
Youthful.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.804
I'm just happy to see you.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.406
How long are you staying?

02:54.508 --> 02:57.309
I don't know. A few weeks.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.211
Or until we both die of old age

02:59.313 --> 03:01.713
and get eaten
      by cats and raccoons.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.650
Okay. Well, let's hope it's just
     a couple of weeks then.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.219
[chuckles] I'm just gonna go
   drop the stuff in my room,

03:07.321 --> 03:09.821
then shower, and we can catch up
         on everything.

03:11.392 --> 03:14.826
Kristen, there's something
       I need to tell you.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.099
Hey there.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.968
You must be Kristen.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.870
Um, yeah.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.306
Who are you?

03:27.408 --> 03:30.576
Mom, why is there
    a barefoot man on my bed?

03:30.678 --> 03:34.179
Oh, honey,
 I've been meaning to tell you.

03:34.281 --> 03:37.082
I rented out your room.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.751
I'm sorry.
     I, I thought she knew.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.820
Mm.

03:41.922 --> 03:45.023
[clears throat] You know what,
   I will, uh, leave you two.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.758
I got some work to do outside.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.227
[Moira] Okay.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.531
Okay. So how did you not
          tell me this?

03:52.633 --> 03:53.765
[chuckles]

03:53.867 --> 03:55.133
We speak twice a day.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.269
Mm, I didn't wanna worry you.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.937
I'm not worried.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.374
-He's really cute.
           -Isn't he?

04:02.476 --> 04:05.811
It's like if the J. Crew catalog
    and the Kennedy Compound

04:05.913 --> 04:07.813
had a love child.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.281
But why do you need a boarder?

04:09.383 --> 04:11.617
Mm, well, some money issues.

04:11.719 --> 04:15.053
What? Um, what about
        the beauty shop?

04:15.155 --> 04:16.954
I thought
  you were having a great year.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.958
I am. I'm just
   always in the red somehow.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.394
You know I suck
 at the business side of things.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.830
I'll come
  look at your books tomorrow.

04:24.932 --> 04:28.233
-Would you?
              -Yes.

04:28.335 --> 04:31.737
And I'll try and find
    another living situation.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.172
No! No, you don't have
           to do that.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.574
Just stay on the couch.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.477
You sure you don't wanna
        Airbnb that, too?

04:38.579 --> 04:41.480
-Mm-mm, funny.
           -[chuckles]

04:41.582 --> 04:44.983
I'm serious. Is it not weird
 having some random guy around?

04:45.085 --> 04:46.885
No, he's handy,

04:46.987 --> 04:50.856
he's been helping to refurbish
   some of the old furniture,

04:50.958 --> 04:52.557
cleaning up the shed.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.526
You did your due diligence
             on him.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.727
-Of course.
            -Really?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.696
So you've checked
         his references,

04:57.798 --> 04:59.831
his previous employers,
        his FICO score--

04:59.933 --> 05:02.100
Sure. Sure, sure, sure.

05:02.202 --> 05:05.404
-Liar.
   -How do you know I didn't?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.039
Because you're you.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.940
At best, you checked
      his astrology chart.

05:09.043 --> 05:10.409
[Moira] Well, he is a Gemini.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.411
And you know I always get along
          with Geminis.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.513
-Mom, be serious.
             -I did.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.182
I-I called his former employer,
  and he got a glowing review.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.151
-[Moira] Okay?
             -Okay.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.254
-That's something.
             -Yeah.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.757
[Moira] Do me a favor.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.592
-Take this out to him.
              -Why?

05:27.695 --> 05:28.927
Because I know
     you're curious as hell,

05:29.029 --> 05:31.797
and I want you
       to get to know him.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.366
-Fine. Twist my arm.
    -Oh, you, can you, uh...

05:34.468 --> 05:36.435
Can you go through your stuff
         at some point?

05:36.537 --> 05:39.137
I-I just, I boxed everything up
     and I put it out there.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.806
Just to make room for him.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.040
You're gonna clear that space
           and make it

05:42.142 --> 05:43.375
a spa for your guests?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.911
[scoffs]
     Just do it, smart-ass.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.279
Off you go.

05:48.215 --> 05:51.216
[mellow music]

05:59.693 --> 06:00.859
Hey there.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.128
Hey.

06:04.264 --> 06:05.964
Mom wanted you to have this.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.066
Oh. Uh, great. You can just
       set it right there.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.534
-Okay.
            -Thanks.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.138
Hey, sorry about earlier.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.074
I-I just, I had no idea
      she hadn't told you.

06:16.176 --> 06:19.244
Don't worry about it.
  It's just another curve ball.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.881
It'll all fall into place.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.584
What?

06:25.686 --> 06:26.718
Your life.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.421
I know exactly
    where you are right now.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.689
You graduate

06:30.791 --> 06:33.458
and there's this big abyss

06:33.560 --> 06:34.960
in front of you
    and it can be terrifying.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.895
Yeah. That.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.830
The big abyss.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.568
You'll find your focus.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.838
And how do you know?

06:46.940 --> 06:48.607
You just met me.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.675
Well, your mom does say

06:50.778 --> 06:53.111
that you're the smartest person
        she knows, so...

06:53.213 --> 06:55.614
Clearly,
   she needs to get out more.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.949
You know, sometimes you just
   need to trust the universe.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.553
I think great things
    are gonna happen for you.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.957
Well, I hope you're right.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.530
You have
    a really beautiful smile.

07:14.468 --> 07:18.470
Okay, well, I am going to go
 back to Planet Earth right now.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.909
But thanks for the positivity.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.778
Anytime.

07:38.325 --> 07:39.624

[gasps] Oh, my God.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.763
Good mornin'.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.832
Oh, come on in.
         Plenty of room.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.835
I'll just come back.

10:14.348 --> 10:15.513
[Moira chuckles]

10:17.684 --> 10:21.286
-What?
            -[laughs]

10:21.388 --> 10:23.355
You're so quiet this morning.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.592
Don't you have
      to get to work soon?

10:27.694 --> 10:31.529
I do, but I just wanna spend
  a little alone time with you.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.467
-[sighs]
             -What?

10:35.569 --> 10:37.369
Oh, my God, Mom.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.106
-You heard us last night?
             -Yeah.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.907
Oh, my God.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.410
It was really hard not to.

10:45.512 --> 10:48.647
Sorry, honey. I did not mean
  for you to find out this way.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.016
How old do you think he is?

10:52.085 --> 10:55.654
I don't know, 25, 26?

10:55.756 --> 10:58.590
You get that's, like,
 two years older than me, right?

10:58.692 --> 11:01.893
So what? It's not like
      I'm gonna marry him.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.229
Well, at least not anytime soon.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.263
-Mom!
            -Well...

11:05.365 --> 11:06.297
I thought you'd be happy for me.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.632
-Really?
              -Yes.

11:07.734 --> 11:08.667
I mean, you're always
         encouraging me

11:08.769 --> 11:09.901
to, to get out there

11:10.003 --> 11:11.136
and start dating.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.738
Yes, out there and dating.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.273
You're not doing that,
        you're hooking up

11:15.375 --> 11:18.276
with a random boy that you found
       inside your house.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.745
No, no, no, no, he's not a boy.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.781
Trust me.
      He's very much a man.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.616
-Ugh...
            -In bed.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.419
Mom, stop! My God!

11:27.521 --> 11:28.687
My ears are bleeding.

11:28.789 --> 11:32.090
-What, are you jealous?
           -Excuse me?

11:32.192 --> 11:35.326
Oh, come on. You just
 haven't been dating that much.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.828
Are you serious?

11:38.265 --> 11:40.198
If I wanted to hook up
         for random sex,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.767
I have plenty of opportunity.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.669
I just don't like the way
        it makes me feel.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.971
It's not like that.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.574
No, it's not.
  He's, he's tender and he's...

11:51.144 --> 11:53.244
He's just so in the moment
       when we're in bed.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.449
Are you forgetting
     that I'm your daughter?

11:57.551 --> 12:01.219
Oh, come on. We always talk
      about your sex life.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.022
I'm just really blind-sided
    by this whole situation.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.391
All right, well, would you just
       stop your judgement

12:06.493 --> 12:09.527
for just five seconds
   and try to be happy for me?

12:10.630 --> 12:13.198
Come on, he makes me feel young

12:13.300 --> 12:15.967
and alive and...

12:16.903 --> 12:17.902
desirable.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.671
[scoffs]

12:19.773 --> 12:21.005
Is there really anything
        wrong with that?

12:21.108 --> 12:22.607
No. No.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.578
Do people at work know?

12:26.680 --> 12:27.912
I don't think so.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.984
[instrumental music playing
           on stereo]

12:36.857 --> 12:38.189
Good morning.

12:38.291 --> 12:41.860
<i> Buenos dias,</i> Mrs. Robinson.
             Ah-ah!

12:41.962 --> 12:44.262
-So, are you...
            -Shh-shh.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.831
And Jake... What? Ah!

12:46.933 --> 12:49.534
-[laughing] Hi, baby!
              -Yay!

12:49.636 --> 12:51.703
[indistinct chatter]

12:51.805 --> 12:52.737
-Hi!
              -Hi!

12:52.839 --> 12:54.572
You look so beautiful!

12:54.674 --> 12:58.009
[laughing] I thought
    you started your new job.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.445
-It fell through.
    -Oh,<i> bendito,</i> I'm sorry.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.413
I bet you'll find something new
         soon, you know?

13:02.516 --> 13:04.382
Yeah. I already applied
       to other programs.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.519
Yeah, that's the spirit.
   You'll get something soon.

13:07.621 --> 13:08.787
You want me to do your hair?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.088
Kristen is here
      in a professional...

13:10.190 --> 13:11.689
-...capacity today.
          -Oh, really?

13:11.792 --> 13:13.391
She's gonna go over my books
           and tell me

13:13.493 --> 13:16.027
why I can barely afford
    my mortgage every month.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.962
Mm. That's really easy.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.131
Hm. It's because your mother
     lives beyond her means.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.766
Okay. Why don't you go
     sit on a curling iron?

13:21.868 --> 13:24.936
I would love to. Yeah.
            [laughs]

13:26.706 --> 13:28.206
-Mom?
              -Hm.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.708
-What is this?
             -What?

13:30.811 --> 13:32.610
You seriously need a bookkeeper.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.513
-Why? I have you.
              -Ugh.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.130
Stop hovering.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.798
Oh, come on.
       What's the verdict?

13:53.900 --> 13:58.102
Guilty of extreme negligence
        of your finances.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.839
[Kristen] You over-schedule
     all of your employees.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.641
Everyone that works here
   is getting overtime hours.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.076
That's crazy.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.811
[Moira] All right, well...

14:06.913 --> 14:08.780
What would you do?

14:08.882 --> 14:10.949
Stagger their hours,

14:11.051 --> 14:13.518
keep everyone down
     to a 40-hour work week.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.853
[doorbell rings]

14:16.389 --> 14:18.623
Hey! What are you doing here?

14:18.725 --> 14:22.026
[sighs] Hey there. Can I, uh,
  just steal you for a minute?

14:22.128 --> 14:23.194
Uh, yeah.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.096
-Hey there.
              -Hey.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.599
[clears throat]

14:28.969 --> 14:30.435
-Hey.
              -Hey!

14:30.537 --> 14:31.970
I just have a little favor
           to ask you.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.438
Yeah. What do you need?

14:33.540 --> 14:34.706
-Payroll's being super slow.
              -Hm.

14:34.808 --> 14:37.275
Can I get you the rent
           next week?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.477
Yeah, no problem.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.945
-Thanks.
           -[giggles]

14:46.052 --> 14:47.085
[doorbell rings]

14:59.065 --> 15:02.267
I mean, yeah,
   he's attractive, but I just
   can't go there MJ, I can't.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.269
And this morning
    I come in to the bathroom

15:04.371 --> 15:06.204
and he's in a towel

15:06.306 --> 15:09.207
and he coyly invites me inside
            with him.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.109
Bold move. Damn.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.944
Sounds like Moira
      got her groove back.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.780
-Mm.
       -You don't approve?

15:15.882 --> 15:18.283
No. I don't trust him.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.718
Or you can't deal
    with your mom having sex.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.755
Stop. No, I don't care
   about that. I really don't.

15:23.857 --> 15:25.390
Look, I'm not blaming you.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.025
I just think

15:27.127 --> 15:29.060
Moira has earned the right
      to have a little fun.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.261
I mean, think about the years
           she worked

15:30.363 --> 15:31.596
to put you through school.

15:31.698 --> 15:32.964
Oh, I know, you're right.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.366
I'm trying to be happy
         for her, but...

15:35.468 --> 15:37.902
I think you should
     give the guy a chance.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.305
What about Ryan?
       Have you seen him?

15:40.407 --> 15:42.807
What are the chances
   I can avoid him all summer?

15:42.909 --> 15:46.577
Zero to nil. Please. I mean,
   he comes in here sometimes.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.980
I gotta say he looks
     pretty good in uniform.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.848
I'm sure he does.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.885
What about work?
       What are you doing?

15:53.987 --> 15:55.620
I don't know.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.723
I was helping my mom
      this morning, but...

15:58.825 --> 16:00.959
-You know, just come work here.
             -What?

16:01.061 --> 16:02.627
[MJ] Seriously, I need somebody.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.262
The girl who works
 the morning shift, she's like,

16:04.364 --> 16:06.564
having a baby or something.
      Just come work here.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.633
-Yeah?
        -It'll be so fun.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.769
-Okay, I'm down.
              -Yes!

16:11.871 --> 16:13.271
You'd look good in uniform, too.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.405
-[chuckles]
      -And it'll be so fun!

16:14.507 --> 16:16.341
-I know.
            -[laughs]

16:24.050 --> 16:26.751
Really? You're blocking me?

16:26.853 --> 16:29.354
I saw your car.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.790
-How long are you in town for?
  -Until I can plot my escape.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.392
[chuckles]

16:36.863 --> 16:41.099
I cannot believe they're
 allowing you to wear a uniform.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.534
Hey, crime rates are down

16:43.636 --> 16:45.503
since I've been
 with the department, all right?

16:45.605 --> 16:47.572
That's 'cause
   you're off the streets now.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.507
Yeah, you got that right.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.279
You look good, Kris.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.648
-Don't start.
             -What?

16:57.751 --> 16:59.250
Come on, I'm being serious.

17:02.122 --> 17:05.022
Have a drink with me later.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.457
You think
     I was hit over the head

17:06.559 --> 17:09.460
and woke up with amnesia?

17:09.561 --> 17:12.396
I've changed, you know?

17:12.499 --> 17:15.133
It's been five years, Ryan.

17:15.234 --> 17:16.567
I've moved on.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.237
Really? Have you?

17:19.339 --> 17:20.938
Because you, uh,
     you seem a little glad

17:21.040 --> 17:22.973
to see me right now.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.717
Fine. Why don't you
         text me later?

17:32.819 --> 17:34.552
-Still got the same number?
             -Yeah.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.754
[Ryan] Hm, 'cause I've tried
       to text you before

17:36.856 --> 17:37.855
and it didn't work.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.724
Hm.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.259
I might have to unblock you.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.593
Oh, yeah.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.465
Go ahead. I'll wait.

17:53.773 --> 17:54.772
Done.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.607
All right.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.743
I'll talk to you later then.

17:58.845 --> 17:59.844
Hey.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.681
You do look good
        in that uniform.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.516
Yeah. I know.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.751
[scoffs]

18:19.732 --> 18:21.632
You know, all this time

18:21.734 --> 18:23.935
and I had no idea
 that you even knew how to cook.

18:24.037 --> 18:26.270
I mean, honestly, I thought
    that burned, baked goods

18:26.372 --> 18:27.939
were really more your specialty.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.907
[Moira] Hey, look,
   my culinary skills might be

18:30.009 --> 18:31.809
a little limited,
       but mac and cheese

18:31.911 --> 18:33.244
has always been
       Kristen's favorite.

18:33.346 --> 18:36.914
-So...
     -Mm-hmm, when I was 12.

18:37.016 --> 18:39.250
I'm kidding. Still really tasty.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.451
Mm.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.654
How's MJ?

18:43.756 --> 18:46.624
She's great. She offered me
       a job at the cafe.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.626
-[Kristen] I start tomorrow.
        -Mm, that's good.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.128
You'll have something to do
       while you're here.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.462
[Kristen] Yeah.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.031
Is it weird
    being back in Riverview?

18:55.201 --> 18:56.400
A little.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.473
[clears throat]
         What about you?

19:05.612 --> 19:07.612
Uh, what about me?

19:07.714 --> 19:10.281
How'd you end up here?

19:10.383 --> 19:14.952
Well... the town kinda found me,
          to be honest.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.787
I was working on Wall Street
     for a couple of years.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.189
He was a vice president.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.292
Ev-everybody
      was a vice president.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.861
You weren't happy doing that?

19:23.963 --> 19:25.663
I was seduced by it
        in the beginning.

19:25.765 --> 19:29.100
You know, the fancy suits,
     the expense accounts...

19:29.202 --> 19:31.369
You know, frankly,
   the easy money, but, uh...

19:31.471 --> 19:33.538
Then I found myself
      working 70-hour weeks

19:33.640 --> 19:36.207
and... having panic attacks.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.342
So I got my car and I drove

19:38.444 --> 19:42.046
until I thought that my, uh,
 past was in my rearview mirror,

19:42.148 --> 19:43.681
I ended up here.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.183
Became a loan officer
          at the bank.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.786
And, honestly,
    I've never been happier.

19:48.888 --> 19:52.356
You just left everything behind
          in New York?

19:52.458 --> 19:55.026
I had a roommate. Yeah, he's got
     most of my stuff still.

19:55.128 --> 19:56.561
Hm.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.797
What about friends, family,
          a girlfriend?

19:59.899 --> 20:03.100
What are you, Oprah?
    It's a lot of questions.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.137
I don't mind.

20:10.143 --> 20:12.210
My parents died
        when I was young.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.679
I've got a brother,
    but, uh, we're not close.

20:14.781 --> 20:18.316
To be honest, I, uh,
   I always felt pretty alone

20:18.418 --> 20:20.251
until I met Moira.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.158
-What about you?
              -Me?

20:27.260 --> 20:29.493
Yeah. Do you have
       a, you know, plan?

20:29.596 --> 20:32.363
I'm going to apply
to a few more teaching programs.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.866
I'd really love to open
 my own psych practice one day.

20:35.969 --> 20:37.501
But, I don't know,
      someone once told me

20:37.604 --> 20:41.339
you just have to trust
     the universe sometimes.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.175
Have you ever thought
      about settling here?

20:44.277 --> 20:45.543
I-I know your mother
     would absolutely love--

20:45.645 --> 20:47.245
-Uh...
          -[Moira] Yes.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.681
No, I'm more
       of a big-city girl.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.917
What, Riverview's too boring
            for you?

20:53.019 --> 20:54.919
I just prefer city life.

20:58.224 --> 21:01.759
Okay. So, does anyone
          want dessert?

21:01.861 --> 21:05.029
I made a Bundt cake,
    and Kristen even brought

21:05.131 --> 21:07.064
an Ethiopian blend
         from MJ's shop.

21:07.166 --> 21:10.201
You know what? I think, uh,
     I'm gonna go on a run.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.702
Let you two ladies catch up.

21:21.314 --> 21:22.480
What was that all about?

21:22.582 --> 21:24.649
You wanted me
       to get to know him.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.652
You're fishing, honey,
      and I don't know why.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.720
Jake is really a sweet guy.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.723
Is that why you're letting him
       slide on the rent?

21:32.825 --> 21:35.026
I'm not. He's gonna be
         one week late.

21:36.029 --> 21:37.395
[Moira] What do you care?

21:37.497 --> 21:40.898
I just don't want him
    taking advantage of you.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.001
Please. If anything,
   it's the other way around.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.737
Ugh! Seriously? You did not
      just wink at me, Mom.

21:46.839 --> 21:47.905
-[Kristen] Did you?
           -[laughing]

21:48.007 --> 21:48.939
[cell phone message alert]

21:49.042 --> 21:50.074
Oh, my God...

21:54.414 --> 21:55.846
[send alert]

21:58.251 --> 22:00.418
Sorry. I think I'm gonna
   head out in a few minutes.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.520
Mm. Hot date?

22:02.622 --> 22:04.588
-Um, yeah.
        -[message alert]

22:04.691 --> 22:07.758
-It's Ryan.
        -You're kidding.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.860
We're just going for a drink.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.862
And he said he's changed.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.832
Well, that's what
      cheaters always say.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.687
[music continues]

22:43.196 --> 22:44.662
-Here you go, guys.
           -Thank you.

22:44.764 --> 22:45.696
-Thank you.
        -You're welcome.

22:45.798 --> 22:48.132
Cheers. To your homecoming.

22:48.234 --> 22:50.067
-Thank you.
         -Welcome back.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.771
[chuckles] Hey, I gotta be
      honest, I'm actually

22:53.873 --> 22:55.172
a little surprised
     you showed up tonight.

22:55.274 --> 22:56.841
Yeah.

22:56.943 --> 22:59.477
I needed to get out
         of that house.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.978
How is Moira?

23:01.080 --> 23:03.814
She still hates me, doesn't she?
         Yeah, she does.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.516
Bitch knows
      how to hold a grudge.

23:05.618 --> 23:09.320
Ah. Like mother, like daughter,
           am I right?

23:09.422 --> 23:11.655
Hm. No, no.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.324
When I slept with that girl,

23:13.426 --> 23:15.059
you weren't returning
         my phone calls.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.294
That's because I was on the way
         to Northwestern

23:17.397 --> 23:21.065
and I needed some time to sort
   things out. I was confused.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.801
It doesn't give you a hall pass
   to sleep with another girl.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.703
You're right.
     I'm not saying it does.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.338
Okay? I'm just trying
    to explain what happened.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.006
Okay, it doesn't even matter.
      Why are we talking--

23:29.108 --> 23:32.009
Yes, it does. Okay?
     Look, it matters to me.

23:32.111 --> 23:34.311
I hated myself for what I did.

23:35.348 --> 23:37.314
Come on, what we had...

23:40.286 --> 23:42.453
I've just, I've never found it
        with anyone else.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.556
-You missed me.
             -I did.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.225
I'm not gonna lie.

23:48.327 --> 23:49.727
And I'd give anything
        to have it back.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.896
-It's not gonna happen.
              -Why?

23:51.998 --> 23:54.432
I'm only in town
   for a short amount of time.

23:54.534 --> 23:57.368
Well, we better
        get started then.

23:57.470 --> 24:01.071
[chuckles]
       You are relentless.

24:01.174 --> 24:03.507
-You still have feelings for me.
              -Mm.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.944
-Mm. I do?
            -Mm-hmm.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.579
And how would you guess that?

24:08.681 --> 24:10.781
Because you wouldn't be here
     tonight if you didn't.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.119
Actually, I was hoping

24:15.221 --> 24:17.855
you could do a background check
       on someone for me.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.391
-A background check?
            -Mm-hmm.

24:20.493 --> 24:23.961
-On who?
    -My mom has this boarder.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.463
I don't trust him.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.399
So that's why you came tonight?

24:28.501 --> 24:31.135
So I would do you a favor.
           Here we go.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.938
Okay, Ryan, what did you expect,
that I was gonna sleep with you?

24:34.040 --> 24:35.039
That that would make me
          forgive you?

24:35.141 --> 24:36.907
I don't know.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.210
-It might help.
             -Geez.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.479
-No?
              -No!

24:42.682 --> 24:44.315
Well, I tried.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.418
I should go.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.119
Are you sure?
     Are you okay to drive?

24:49.222 --> 24:50.454
I had two beers.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.725
Okay, what?
    Are you gonna arrest me?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.594
I will let it slide this time.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.864
Then I'm leaving.
  But thank you for the drinks.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.233
You're welcome.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.005
Bye.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.013

25:30.897 --> 25:33.898
[dramatic music]

25:53.019 --> 25:55.019
[Moira]
   Where were you last night?

25:55.121 --> 25:57.788
I was hoping
      you'd come upstairs.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.257
Sorry, babe, I was just so tired
         after the run,

26:00.359 --> 26:02.326
I could barely move.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.597
You came home kinda late.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.701
[Jake] Yeah, you know,
 I was just, I was just running

26:10.803 --> 26:12.870
for a while...

26:12.972 --> 26:14.838
Lost track of time.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.210
[Kristen] Good morning.

26:20.313 --> 26:22.980
Hey, sweetie.
       You want some eggs?

26:23.082 --> 26:24.682
-No. Just coffee.
             -Okay.

26:26.385 --> 26:27.985
How was your run?

26:29.088 --> 26:31.555
Uh, um... Excuse me? What?

26:31.657 --> 26:33.123
Your run.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.696
Oh, uh, fine.

27:07.693 --> 27:10.694
[indistinct radio chatter]

27:18.704 --> 27:20.104
[car honks]

27:25.177 --> 27:28.178
[siren wailing]

27:31.984 --> 27:33.517
-Have a good one.
           -Thank you.

27:34.620 --> 27:36.186
[sighs]

27:37.289 --> 27:39.289
Why isn't Ryan texting me back?

27:39.392 --> 27:40.658
Maybe 'cause you left him
           at the bar

27:40.760 --> 27:42.426
with his ... in his hand.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.530
Ah, speak of the devil.

27:46.632 --> 27:47.931
You wanted to speak with me?

27:48.034 --> 27:49.466
What happened in the woods
           last night?

27:49.568 --> 27:52.436
Wow! Good morning to you, too.

27:52.538 --> 27:53.771
Can I get a coffee, MJ?

27:53.873 --> 27:55.773
-Thank you.
         -What happened?

27:56.742 --> 27:58.809
It was a female jogger.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.611
She was assaulted and strangled.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.513
It was him.

28:02.615 --> 28:04.348
Kris, careful what you say.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.818
Jake. My mom's boarder.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.620
On the way home,
      someone came running

28:09.722 --> 28:12.623
out of the woods last night,
  and his eyes were all crazy.

28:12.725 --> 28:13.957
-It was him.
    -Are you sure it was him?

28:14.060 --> 28:17.127
-[Kristen] Yes.
         -A 100 percent?

28:17.229 --> 28:18.395
No...

28:18.497 --> 28:19.997
No, I'm not a 100 percent sure,
              but--

28:20.099 --> 28:21.498
I'm just saying
 you shouldn't make accusations

28:21.600 --> 28:24.401
without having any proof,
           all right?

28:24.503 --> 28:27.071
No. I know in my gut.

28:27.173 --> 28:29.139
It was him.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.741
I have to get back to work.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.577
Thank you for the coffee.

28:35.748 --> 28:36.847
I'm not wrong.

28:36.949 --> 28:38.449
I believe you.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.386
[birds chirping]

28:50.996 --> 28:52.496
Hello?

28:56.402 --> 28:58.102
Anyone home?

29:11.851 --> 29:14.852
[dramatic music]

29:41.680 --> 29:44.681
[music continues]

30:02.802 --> 30:04.168
What the hell are you doing?

30:04.270 --> 30:05.402
Oh, hey!

30:06.639 --> 30:08.972
I didn't hear you come in.

30:09.074 --> 30:12.409
I was just looking
   for one of my old sweaters.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.548
I wasn't anticipating
          this weather.

30:19.451 --> 30:20.651
They're in a box in the shed.

30:20.753 --> 30:23.287
I think your mother
         told you that.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.989
Did she? I didn't hear that.

30:30.563 --> 30:33.163
I'm sorry
    for invading your space.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.364
[sighs]

30:35.768 --> 30:38.235
Uh, what are you doing here
            so early?

30:38.337 --> 30:40.537
I spilled something on my tie.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.707
You drove all the way home
         for a new tie?

30:45.177 --> 30:46.443
Yes.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.347
Okay.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.383
I guess I'll just go
   and check in the shed then.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.754
You really should mind
       your own business.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.290
Or what?

31:01.260 --> 31:02.893
You don't wanna find out.

31:16.842 --> 31:18.976
He's a total creep.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.677
I want you to check him out.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.047
Drop by later?

31:26.151 --> 31:29.253
I am using you.
Do you have a problem with that?

31:29.355 --> 31:32.222
-[Moira] Kristen?
           -I'm here.

31:32.324 --> 31:33.891
See you later.

31:34.860 --> 31:37.060
Hey, you need help?

31:37.162 --> 31:40.330
No, I'm just trying
  to get this stuff organized.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.833
[Moira] Mm.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.835
[Kristen] I forgot
    what a little jock I was.

31:44.937 --> 31:47.638
Oh, those uniforms
         cost a fortune.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.606
That's what you remember?

31:49.708 --> 31:52.342
Oops! Stop.
     I was so proud of you.

31:52.444 --> 31:56.113
Are you gonna stay for dinner?
I'm making chicken and couscous.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.582
-Couscous?
   -Mm-hmm. Trying new things.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.685
[chuckles] Sounds great.

32:01.787 --> 32:04.588
-Mom?
             -Yeah?

32:04.690 --> 32:06.490
Can I talk to you
        about something?

32:06.592 --> 32:09.192
As long as it's not about Jake.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.496
-He threatened me.
             -What?

32:12.598 --> 32:16.099
-Why?
    -He found me in his room.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.969
He must have thought
 I was going through his things.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.637
-Well, were you?
              -No.

32:20.739 --> 32:23.140
-I was looking for a sweater.
        -[chuckles] Okay.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.808
Well, I boxed them up
    and I put them out here.

32:24.910 --> 32:26.710
I thought I told you that.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.712
I guess I didn't hear you.

32:28.814 --> 32:30.113
Well, what did he say?

32:30.215 --> 32:32.182
Told me to mind my own business.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.518
Ah, well, that doesn't sound
         so threatening.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.787
It was the way he said it.

32:36.889 --> 32:38.288
Like, he wanted to strangle me.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.058
You know what?
    You're being so dramatic.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.392
You think
     I'm making all this up?

32:42.494 --> 32:44.294
No, I just don't think
          you like him

32:44.396 --> 32:46.196
and you're trying to see
       the worst in him--

32:46.298 --> 32:48.398
Well, I'm sorry,
 but he's put up more red flags

32:48.500 --> 32:50.033
than the Chinese embassy,
          and you seem

32:50.135 --> 32:52.135
completely blind to it.

32:52.237 --> 32:54.037
I'm gonna go make dinner.

32:54.139 --> 32:57.207
Did you hear about the jogger?
   The one that was murdered?

32:57.309 --> 32:59.309
[Moira] Yeah. It's horrible.

32:59.411 --> 33:03.080
Well, do you think
 Jake might have seen something?

33:04.283 --> 33:05.749
I hope you're not suggesting

33:05.851 --> 33:07.584
that he had anything to do
           with that.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.319
He was out jogging last night.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.688
So were dozens of other people.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.724
His workout clothes are missing.

33:13.826 --> 33:15.492
Are you being serious right now?

33:15.594 --> 33:16.994
Is that why
      you were in his room?

33:17.096 --> 33:19.196
Why else do you think
      he came home so late?

33:19.298 --> 33:20.430
Enough, Kristen.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.699
You know nothing about him.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.535
What? That automatically makes
         him a murderer?

33:25.637 --> 33:28.505
-Are you really siding with him?
  -I'm not siding with anyone.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.674
I just think
 you're being a little paranoid.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.410
He's on a bunch of medication.
 It's all hidden in his drawer.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.746
I know. He's on antidepressants.
       He already told me.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.114
-Who isn't these days?
            -I'm not.

33:37.216 --> 33:40.083
Yeah. Well, maybe you should be.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.686
Mom, I'm not finished!

33:48.027 --> 33:49.526
[cutlery clinking]

33:56.969 --> 33:58.101
[Moira clears throat]

34:01.073 --> 34:03.106
So I'm, um,

34:03.208 --> 34:07.044
thinking of closing the shop
           on Sundays.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.246
What do you think?

34:09.348 --> 34:12.449
Yeah? Or you could just have
       one person come in.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.385
Mm, they'd hate that.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.487
They love to chatter. [chuckles]

34:17.589 --> 34:20.257
Mom, they're your employees,
        not your friends.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.958
Oh, but they adore you
           over there.

34:24.429 --> 34:26.263
Okay.
   Well, that's not the point.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.665
The point is
 to keep the business profitable

34:28.766 --> 34:30.900
so Moira doesn't lose
           this house.

34:31.003 --> 34:32.969
Yeah, we'd never
        let that happen.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.639
[Moira] Kristen's exaggerating.

34:36.742 --> 34:40.543
Her imagination
 gets the best of her sometimes.

34:40.646 --> 34:44.181
Really? I would love to hear
     more examples of that.

34:47.686 --> 34:48.819
[doorbell rings]

34:48.920 --> 34:49.985
Who's that?

34:50.089 --> 34:51.987
That would be Ryan.

34:52.091 --> 34:54.424
He's taking me
     for a motorcycle ride.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.960
Oh. Do you think that's smart?

34:57.062 --> 35:00.664
Well, life comes
with a lot of risks, doesn't it?

35:02.434 --> 35:04.868
I can't believe
     she's seeing him again.

35:04.970 --> 35:06.503
And who is he?

35:06.605 --> 35:08.839
Her ex-boyfriend.

35:08.941 --> 35:11.174
He's a deputy
  for the sheriff's department.

35:15.047 --> 35:16.413
You never mentioned him.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.582
Well, I thought
   he was out of the picture.

35:23.555 --> 35:26.056
Mrs. Atherton.
       Long time, no see.

35:26.158 --> 35:27.891
Hello, Ryan.

35:27.993 --> 35:30.127
And, Ryan, this is Jake.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.394
He's renting out my old room.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.163
-Oh, yeah.
           -Hey, man.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.564
-It's so nice to meet you.
           -You, too.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.733
Yeah, I hear
   you are in law enforcement.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.568
-[Jake] Yeah. Good on you.
          -Thanks, man.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.904
Off the clock now.
    You know, civilian hours.

35:41.006 --> 35:42.339
[chuckles]

35:42.441 --> 35:45.375
Ryan's actually working
        that jogger case.

35:45.477 --> 35:48.612
Really? You know, I was reading
       about that online.

35:48.714 --> 35:53.216
And it turns out, I was on
 the same exact path last night.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.351
Kristen told me.

35:54.453 --> 35:55.385
You didn't happen to see
            anything

35:55.487 --> 35:57.220
by chance, did you?

35:57.322 --> 35:58.588
No.

35:58.690 --> 36:01.525
You know,
    but it-it is truly scary

36:01.627 --> 36:04.594
that stuff like that happens
           in such...

36:04.696 --> 36:07.430
a quiet little town like this.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.366
You didn't hear anything?

36:09.468 --> 36:11.401
No, I wear, uh, headphones
           when I jog.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.171
Didn't you say
  you were off the clock, Ryan?

36:14.273 --> 36:15.338
Yeah, I did.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.373
Then maybe you should stop

36:16.475 --> 36:17.941
interrogating him.

36:18.043 --> 36:20.210
[chuckles]

36:20.312 --> 36:21.778
Didn't even realize
         I was doing it.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.114
-Force of habit, I guess.
      -I don't mind at all.

36:24.216 --> 36:25.549
Seriously,
     I just wish there was,

36:25.651 --> 36:27.350
there was something
       I could do to help.

36:27.452 --> 36:28.952
You know, I am fascinated

36:29.054 --> 36:31.087
by all this true crime stuff.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.023
I'm sure you are.

36:34.159 --> 36:35.425
Are you ready to go?

36:35.527 --> 36:37.894
-Yeah. Yeah.
             -Yeah?

36:37.996 --> 36:39.262
Nice to meet you.

36:40.399 --> 36:41.865
Mrs. Atherton.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.535
-Hm.
     -[Moira clears throat]

36:47.739 --> 36:48.705
[Kristen] So admit it,
        there's something

36:48.807 --> 36:50.106
weird about him, right?

36:50.209 --> 36:52.309
Yeah, but it doesn't
      make him a murderer.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.777
You're doing
  that background check for me?

36:53.879 --> 36:55.745
Yes, I told you, I will.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.547
-Okay?
           -Thank you.

36:57.649 --> 37:01.117
Mm, you know, I think he got off
     on you questioning him.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.320
-On me questioning him?
            -Mm-hmm.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.821
Can you just give me
      a little bit of time

37:04.923 --> 37:06.957
so I can build a case, please?

37:07.059 --> 37:09.392
I think I found blood
     on one of his sneakers.

37:09.494 --> 37:10.627
And how would you know that?

37:10.729 --> 37:12.729
I went to his closet.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.564
What were you doing
         in his closet?

37:14.666 --> 37:17.634
I don't know, Ryan,
   looking for my prom dress.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.337
No, I was looking for evidence
        and I found some.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.138
Kristen, please,
      do not get involved.

37:22.241 --> 37:23.840
I am involved.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.775
I'm living under the same roof
         as some psycho

37:25.877 --> 37:26.943
who's sleeping with my mom.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.645
Exactly.

37:28.747 --> 37:31.114
Okay? You're not objective.

37:31.216 --> 37:33.016
Let me take care of it.

37:33.118 --> 37:36.419
If this guy is-is as dangerous
       as you think he is,

37:36.521 --> 37:38.922
then the last thing
 you want to do is provoke him.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.025
I guess you're right.

37:43.895 --> 37:46.363
[Moira] Breakfast?

37:46.465 --> 37:49.165
-[Jake] Do you count?
        -[Moira chuckles]

37:49.268 --> 37:50.800
[Moira]
    Well, what's on the menu?

37:50.902 --> 37:52.535
[Jake moans]

37:52.638 --> 37:54.871
I wish that I didn't have
      to go to work today.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.206
Mm...

37:58.577 --> 38:00.577
[Jake] I should shower.
           [Moira] Hm.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.183
[sighs]

38:24.236 --> 38:27.237
[shower running]

38:37.382 --> 38:38.782
Damn it!

39:06.611 --> 39:08.011
[exhales sharply]

39:09.414 --> 39:11.648
[footsteps approaching]

39:13.952 --> 39:15.185
[sighs]

39:24.629 --> 39:26.996
[dramatic music]

39:41.480 --> 39:44.481
[door creaking]

39:48.854 --> 39:50.320
[Moira] Kristen?

39:54.292 --> 39:56.326
Hey, Kristen, you want coffee?

40:00.899 --> 40:03.933
-Hey! Good morning!
        -What you doin'?

40:04.035 --> 40:06.436
Just getting my stuff organized.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.338
-You want some?
             -Sure.

40:09.408 --> 40:10.807
Hm.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.809
Are you keeping these?

40:12.911 --> 40:14.511
No, I'm throwing them away.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.846
[gasps]
    What? All these trophies?

40:16.948 --> 40:20.016
-You worked so hard for them.
           -Mom, stop.

40:20.118 --> 40:22.752
Just leave it alone.
        It's all clutter.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.288
I don't wanna get
    all sentimental about it.

40:25.390 --> 40:27.490
Okay. It's your stuff.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.694
You going somewhere?

40:33.432 --> 40:36.699
I'm going to stay with MJ
 while I look for another place.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.770
It's feeling really crowded
            in here.

40:40.872 --> 40:42.672
Are you sure?

40:42.774 --> 40:44.441
I think it's for the best.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.044
[Jake clears throat]

40:48.146 --> 40:50.013
[Jake] Hey!

40:50.115 --> 40:51.881
-Morning.
            -Morning.

40:53.552 --> 40:56.319
-You going somewhere?
             -Yeah.

40:56.421 --> 40:57.520
Okay.
   Well, I'll give you a hand.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.789
No, I'm good. Thanks.

41:01.092 --> 41:03.092
Okay, then.

41:03.195 --> 41:04.427
You don't want help...

41:12.737 --> 41:14.437
[laughs]

41:15.474 --> 41:17.574
[scatting]

41:17.676 --> 41:20.109
Sherrie, can I talk to you
          for a minute?

41:22.180 --> 41:23.580
Am I in trouble?

41:23.682 --> 41:25.982
-No, of course not.
             -Okay.

41:27.686 --> 41:31.154
You know I adore you, right?
     I mean, everyone does.

41:31.256 --> 41:32.922
<i> Mira, ...,</i>
       are you firing me?

41:33.024 --> 41:34.491
Oh, stop it.

41:34.593 --> 41:36.326
-You know, I'm your top earner.
            -I know.

41:36.428 --> 41:38.061
-What?
             -Okay.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.763
It, it's just that
     when Kristen was here,

41:40.866 --> 41:42.131
she made
    a few really good points.

41:42.234 --> 41:44.133
Like-like, I-I am paying

41:44.236 --> 41:45.435
way too much on overtime.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.003
Well, the only reason
         why I stay late

41:47.105 --> 41:49.739
is because my clients
   can't come during the day.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.108
Well, maybe you could start
        your shift later?

41:52.210 --> 41:53.676
And we're taking
        too many breaks.

41:53.778 --> 41:55.745
We really need to cut back.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.147
Okay. Is this because
        Kristen said so?

41:58.250 --> 42:00.517
No, because I said so.

42:00.619 --> 42:03.286
-And this is my shop.
             -Okay?

42:03.388 --> 42:05.588
Well, we don't need
      three shampoo girls.

42:07.526 --> 42:09.659
Okay.

42:09.761 --> 42:11.995
-I'll look into that.
             -Great.

42:12.097 --> 42:13.930
Well, I was on my way to lunch,

42:14.032 --> 42:15.932
you know, if I'm still allowed
           to do that.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.535
Of course.
     Keep it under an hour.

42:18.637 --> 42:21.838
Of course. Yes, Ma'am. [sighs]

42:22.674 --> 42:25.008
[Sherrie laughs]

42:28.013 --> 42:31.014
[dramatic music]

42:43.628 --> 42:45.595
Whose laundry is this?

42:48.266 --> 42:50.466
Can you remove it
    from the machine, please?

42:53.972 --> 42:55.338
No?

42:55.440 --> 42:56.606
Fine.

43:06.685 --> 43:08.418
Hey! What are you doing?

43:10.288 --> 43:12.855
Can you please stop? I don't
 like people touching my things.

43:12.958 --> 43:14.090
Well, maybe
     you shouldn't leave it

43:14.192 --> 43:15.992
sitting in the machine then. Hm?

43:16.094 --> 43:18.728
-What's your problem?
 -Fine. You go ahead and do it.

43:18.830 --> 43:20.330
I'm not really a fan of,
          uh, handling

43:20.432 --> 43:22.231
your granny panties anyways.

43:22.334 --> 43:24.334
Wow. You don't have to be
          such a jerk.

43:27.772 --> 43:32.075
[Jake] Are you really calling me
    a jerk, you slovenly cow?

43:32.177 --> 43:34.344
Who do you think you are, huh?
       The laundry police?

43:34.446 --> 43:36.279
[woman] What's your problem?
         Calm down. ...!

43:36.381 --> 43:37.580
[Jake] Don't you tell me
          to calm down.

43:37.682 --> 43:39.716
Don't you dare tell me
           what to do.

43:39.818 --> 43:41.084
-[Jake] Who are you--
         -Jake,<i> papito.</i>

43:41.186 --> 43:43.786
-What?
      -Is everything okay?

43:45.857 --> 43:48.691
It, it's me, Sherrie,
       from Moira's shop.

43:50.729 --> 43:53.062
Of course. I know. [laughs]

43:53.164 --> 43:54.864
I'm sorry, I-I've just, uh...

43:54.966 --> 43:56.299
I've been
  a little stressed out today,

43:56.401 --> 43:57.367
kind of lost my head there.

43:57.469 --> 43:59.736
Uh, excuse me, just a moment.

43:59.838 --> 44:02.538
Ma'am, uh, can I offer
     to pay for your dryer?

44:04.042 --> 44:05.975
[laughs]

44:06.077 --> 44:07.377
<i> Mijo,</i> it's okay,
        you sound like me

44:07.479 --> 44:08.745
with customer service people.

44:08.847 --> 44:10.947
-I mean, she'll get over it...
              -Ah!

44:11.049 --> 44:12.548
You know what, I just...

44:12.651 --> 44:14.450
Honestly, I just,
 I just feel embarrassed. Uh...

44:14.552 --> 44:16.085
Oh, no. Oh, I'll get that.

44:16.187 --> 44:17.387
Oh, my God.
       Oh, no, it's okay.

44:17.489 --> 44:18.721
I'll help you.

44:20.859 --> 44:22.792
-Is this blood?
             -Um...

44:22.894 --> 44:25.561
Yeah. Yeah, I-I cut myself
          on a branch.

44:25.664 --> 44:27.263
Really? <i> Bendito,</i> are you okay?

44:27.365 --> 44:28.998
-Do you need anything?
  -Oh, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

44:29.100 --> 44:30.800
But, hey, you know what,
     can you do me a favor?

44:30.902 --> 44:33.069
And, uh, you know,
        don't tell Moira.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.238
You know, she gets
    a little over-protective.

44:35.340 --> 44:38.041
Of course. [chuckles]
         Mum's the word.

44:41.112 --> 44:43.246
Well, I should get back to work.

44:43.348 --> 44:45.648
You know what? [clears throat]
              Um...

44:47.585 --> 44:51.354
I'll give you a ride.
 I've got my car right out back.

44:51.456 --> 44:53.122
I-it's okay.
     My car is in the back.

44:53.224 --> 44:54.991
[stammers] I can drive.
      I really have to go.

44:55.093 --> 44:56.626
It was nice seeing you, Jake.

44:56.728 --> 44:59.729
[dramatic music]

45:11.076 --> 45:12.675
Who are you texting, Sherrie?

45:13.611 --> 45:16.446
-An Uber.
             -Oops.

45:16.548 --> 45:19.916
See, didn't you just tell me
   that you've got a car here?

45:20.018 --> 45:22.118
You really think
        I'm that stupid?

45:25.557 --> 45:26.656
[sighs]

45:26.758 --> 45:29.992
-You dirty liar!
        -[phone clatters]

45:30.095 --> 45:32.295
[grunts] Oh, let me go!

45:32.397 --> 45:33.496
-[grunts]
          -Ah! Help me!

45:33.598 --> 45:35.298
-[grunts]
            -[groans]

45:35.400 --> 45:36.332

45:40.538 --> 45:43.539

45:45.777 --> 45:47.477
Ah...

[grunts]

[groaning]

45:55.620 --> 45:57.920
[indistinct chatter]

45:58.022 --> 46:00.656
Hey. This one's on the house.

46:00.759 --> 46:02.492
Oh, no, I feel like
        there's gonna be

46:02.594 --> 46:05.695
a bunch of strings attached. I'd
rather give you the three bucks.

46:05.797 --> 46:06.929
[scoffs]

46:08.500 --> 46:10.333
I actually have to show you
           something.

46:11.369 --> 46:14.403
-Okay.
              -MJ.

46:14.506 --> 46:16.572
Could you watch this
          for a second?

46:19.344 --> 46:21.444
But you have to promise me
         not to be mad.

46:21.546 --> 46:23.012
I'm making no such promises.

46:23.114 --> 46:25.615
-MJ, can you watch that?
      -Bring her back safe.

46:29.454 --> 46:31.187
[sighs] Kids.

46:34.492 --> 46:35.758
What the hell is that?

46:35.860 --> 46:37.627
-Evidence.
            -Of what?

46:37.729 --> 46:39.462
-Athlete's foot?
              -No.

46:39.564 --> 46:41.430
Look. That has to be blood.

46:41.533 --> 46:45.034
Okay. Put it away.
         This isn't <i> CSI.</i>

46:45.136 --> 46:46.769
We don't have
 a high-tech crime lab on site.

46:46.871 --> 46:49.205
We barely have
   a working vending machine.

46:49.307 --> 46:51.207
[scoffs] Okay.
   So what do you usually do?

46:51.309 --> 46:52.608
We send it to a lab.

46:52.710 --> 46:54.110
It usually takes
       at least five days.

46:54.212 --> 46:55.711
Sometimes weeks.

46:55.814 --> 46:57.246
Okay.

46:57.348 --> 46:59.448
Ryan, can you please do this
             for me?

46:59.551 --> 47:02.418
You realize
    this could get me fired?

47:02.520 --> 47:04.754
What happened
     to the bad-ass maverick

47:04.856 --> 47:07.256
that I used to hang out with?

47:07.358 --> 47:08.658
What do I get?

47:08.760 --> 47:10.626
The satisfaction
       of a job well done?

47:10.728 --> 47:12.228
Nah.

47:12.330 --> 47:13.796
I want a date.

47:14.866 --> 47:16.065
At a serious restaurant

47:16.167 --> 47:18.401
that has a wine list
        and table cloth.

47:18.503 --> 47:21.304
-You ask for a lot.
   -Well, those are my terms.

47:22.740 --> 47:24.140
Fine, I'm not wearing a dress.

47:24.242 --> 47:26.876
Fine. I'm not wearing
      ripped jeans, either.

47:26.978 --> 47:28.044
Fine.

47:34.185 --> 47:36.586
Yeah.

47:36.688 --> 47:38.788
[Moira] Hey.

47:38.890 --> 47:41.924
-Is everything okay?
          -[Jake sighs]

47:42.026 --> 47:44.093
Yeah, just, uh...

47:45.697 --> 47:47.864
Just had a stressful day
     at work. How about you?

47:47.966 --> 47:49.932
I'm just trying
        to reach Sherrie.

47:51.369 --> 47:53.169
Uh, Sherrie?

47:53.271 --> 47:55.104
Yeah, she's one of my stylists.

47:55.206 --> 47:57.506
-You met her.
    -Right. Yeah. I remember.

47:57.609 --> 48:01.110
She just left for lunch,
    and she never came back.

48:01.212 --> 48:02.845
Maybe she's mad at me
   because I was trying to cut

48:02.947 --> 48:04.413
some of her shifts.

48:07.218 --> 48:08.851
What happened to your shirt?

48:10.922 --> 48:14.824
Ah, you know,
 it's-it's pretty embarrassing.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.659
Really?

48:16.761 --> 48:17.793
Tell me.

48:19.397 --> 48:20.496
[sighs]

48:20.598 --> 48:22.832
I was, uh, challenged to play

48:22.934 --> 48:24.300
a game of pick-up basketball
             at work

48:24.402 --> 48:26.502
and popped a couple of buttons.

48:26.604 --> 48:28.704
Oh. In your suit.

48:30.074 --> 48:31.307
That was part of the challenge.

48:31.409 --> 48:35.378
[chuckles]
    And you couldn't say no.

48:35.480 --> 48:36.579
[sighs] You know me.

48:36.681 --> 48:40.082
Sometimes I am just, uh,

48:40.184 --> 48:41.951
stupidly competitive.

48:42.987 --> 48:45.488
God! What happened to your face?

48:45.590 --> 48:47.323
Oh, um, y-you know,
        one of the guys,

48:47.425 --> 48:49.992
um, scratched me on rebound.
        It's no big deal.

48:50.094 --> 48:52.328
All right. Well, let me get you
   a wet towel or something--

48:52.430 --> 48:55.531
You know what,
     I'm, uh, I'm, I'm fine.

48:55.633 --> 48:56.933
Oh, yeah.
  Well, let me look at it then.

48:57.035 --> 48:58.067
Hey, would you,
       would you just, uh,

48:58.169 --> 48:59.669
just, just leave it. [scoffs]

48:59.771 --> 49:01.103
Please?

49:02.774 --> 49:04.106
Okay.

49:09.180 --> 49:11.747
You kind of remind me
           of Kristen.

49:11.849 --> 49:13.449
You know, she used to always
  come home with these scrapes

49:13.551 --> 49:15.117
and bruises, you know,
         a total tomboy.

49:15.219 --> 49:17.720
[laughing]

49:17.822 --> 49:19.989
You sure talk
      about Kristen a lot.

49:21.192 --> 49:23.192
Of course. She's my daughter.

49:26.331 --> 49:27.863
You're a good mom.

49:30.234 --> 49:32.868
I hope she appreciates you.

49:32.971 --> 49:34.637
Let's get you out of these...

49:34.739 --> 49:37.473
-Uh, don't!
              -Oh!

49:37.575 --> 49:40.076
-Okay.
  -I'm sorry, okay? I'm just...

49:40.178 --> 49:42.611
I just need, a, a few minutes.

49:42.714 --> 49:44.547
It's all right. I get it.

49:46.050 --> 49:48.918
Sometimes I come home
           and I, uh,

49:49.020 --> 49:52.021
just wanna sit in the bath
     for a couple of hours.

49:52.123 --> 49:55.491
-Yeah.
  -I'll just be in the kitchen.

49:56.627 --> 49:57.860
Okay.

50:23.388 --> 50:24.587

50:25.356 --> 50:27.123
That bitch.

50:39.237 --> 50:42.238
[dramatic music]

50:47.979 --> 50:50.112
Thank you so much
    for letting me stay here.

50:50.214 --> 50:51.614
No problem.

-That's my car.
          -That's odd.

51:02.927 --> 51:05.327
No, it's super-sensitive.
       It goes off a lot.

51:05.430 --> 51:08.164
Sounds like my last boyfriend.

51:08.266 --> 51:10.232
-I'll be back.

54:13.484 --> 54:15.150
It's gonna be okay, all right?

54:16.921 --> 54:18.654
Look.

54:18.756 --> 54:21.023
Ooh, that's harsh.

54:21.125 --> 54:23.926
Yeah. She's delusional.

54:25.529 --> 54:27.363
Do you want me to check on her?

54:27.465 --> 54:30.132
No. She just
      doesn't wanna listen.

54:31.936 --> 54:35.304
Look, is there any way
  that you can just arrest him?

54:36.707 --> 54:38.874
-Are you sure it was him?
        -In my gut, yes.

54:38.976 --> 54:40.509
Kristen, I need more than that.

54:40.611 --> 54:43.412
This can't be a coincidence.

54:43.514 --> 54:45.047
Look, if I bring him in,
        I wanna make sure

54:45.149 --> 54:46.849
I have him dead to rights.

54:46.951 --> 54:49.251
All right? I can't let him walk.

54:52.657 --> 54:54.290
Where are you going?

54:54.392 --> 54:56.725
To file a report.
         You wanna come?

54:56.827 --> 54:59.261
Do you need me to?

54:59.363 --> 55:01.196
No, but you shouldn't be alone.

55:01.299 --> 55:02.631
She won't be.

55:02.733 --> 55:05.000
Can you clock me out?

55:05.102 --> 55:07.336
I'll leave you in good
   hands then. [clicks tongue]

55:10.141 --> 55:12.074
She's Team Ryan,

55:12.176 --> 55:14.476
if you haven't noticed.

55:14.578 --> 55:15.911
Aren't you?

55:16.013 --> 55:18.681
My eyes have been so glued.

55:20.718 --> 55:22.685
I really am sorry, Kris.

Shut the door.

[Jake] Hm. You know, I'm just
    glad that today is over.

56:02.059 --> 56:03.459
Yeah.

56:03.561 --> 56:07.296
I know I could sleep
     for a really long time.

56:07.398 --> 56:10.165
Mm, me, too.

56:10.267 --> 56:12.935
You want a sleeping pill?

56:13.037 --> 56:14.603
No, I'm okay.

56:15.706 --> 56:17.606
-You sure?
            -Mm-hmm.

56:17.708 --> 56:20.843
Come on. I just wanna feel you
       melt into my arms.

56:20.945 --> 56:22.411
[Moira] Mm.

56:24.348 --> 56:26.181
Maybe just half of one.

56:38.362 --> 56:41.363
[dramatic music]

56:52.443 --> 56:54.543
[Ryan] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
      What can you tell me?

56:57.615 --> 56:59.214
He changed it legally?

57:01.152 --> 57:02.951
What did his name use to be?

57:04.822 --> 57:06.388
No, no, that's really helpful.

57:06.490 --> 57:08.190
Thanks.

57:08.292 --> 57:12.060
-What about Jake?
    -Let me do my job, Kris.

57:12.163 --> 57:13.896
He changed his name?

57:15.900 --> 57:18.066
Are we just gonna ignore
    what happened last night?

57:20.104 --> 57:21.770
No.

57:21.872 --> 57:23.439
It was wonderful.

57:23.541 --> 57:24.773
It was.

57:25.810 --> 57:27.609
We're good together.

57:29.046 --> 57:30.813
Yes, we are.

57:33.150 --> 57:34.883
So is this his real name?

57:34.985 --> 57:37.753
Ah, stop. Okay?

57:37.855 --> 57:39.555
Look, I'm going straight to
 work, and the first thing I do

57:39.657 --> 57:41.356
when I get there is I'm putting
  this name through the system.

57:41.459 --> 57:42.958
-All right?
-No, let's google him right now.

57:43.060 --> 57:45.194
No, Kri... No. All right?

57:45.296 --> 57:47.129
We're not some
    crime-fighting duo here.

57:47.231 --> 57:49.064
Hey, I'm the one who told you
           about Jake.

57:49.166 --> 57:51.633
You owe me this.

57:51.735 --> 57:54.470
Seriously, are you trying
        to get me fired?

57:54.572 --> 57:57.172
I'm trying to protect my mom.

[shower running]

[dramatic music]

58:23.167 --> 58:25.934
[Kristen] Ryan?
          [Ryan] Yeah?

58:26.036 --> 58:28.737
Look, this proves everything
        I've been saying.

58:28.839 --> 58:29.771
What?

58:29.874 --> 58:30.806
When he was a teenager,

58:30.908 --> 58:32.241
he was on trial for murder.

58:32.343 --> 58:34.810
He was accused
    of killing his neighbor.

58:34.912 --> 58:36.345
His brother's girlfriend.

58:36.447 --> 58:37.613
That's why he changed his name.

58:37.715 --> 58:39.548
He wants to run from all this.

58:40.851 --> 58:43.452
Okay. Can I rinse off now?

58:43.554 --> 58:45.187
-Is that all you have to say?
     -All right, all right.

58:45.289 --> 58:47.289
Just give me a second. We'll
 talk it all through, all right?

58:47.391 --> 58:48.891
-I'm calling my mom.
       -Just relax, okay?

58:48.993 --> 58:50.425
Don't do anything stupid!

58:53.264 --> 58:54.863
[sighs]

58:56.834 --> 58:58.400
[phone chimes]

59:09.280 --> 59:12.681
[sighs] Mom, I-I've been
     texting you all night.

59:12.783 --> 59:15.984
-Why are you avoiding me?
     -I'm not avoiding you.

59:16.086 --> 59:18.954
I just took a sleeping pill,
   and my phone was charging.

59:19.056 --> 59:21.890
-[stammers] Are you alone?
             -Yeah.

59:21.992 --> 59:23.292
Where's Jake?

59:25.596 --> 59:27.129
-He's still sleeping.
             <i> -Okay.</i>

59:27.231 --> 59:28.830
Well, I've sent you
  some articles and I need you

59:28.933 --> 59:30.699
to read them right now.

59:30.801 --> 59:32.668
Okay.

59:32.770 --> 59:36.405
-Why?
 -Jake isn't even his real name.

59:36.507 --> 59:39.575
Well, he changed his name. So?

59:39.677 --> 59:43.345
He was on trial for murder
     when he was a teenager.

59:43.447 --> 59:45.547
[Kristen] <i> Ask him why</i>
   <i> he never talks about that.</i>

59:45.649 --> 59:47.349

[Moira] <i> Are you sure</i>

Yes, it's him.

59:51.288 --> 59:53.689
Everything he told you is a lie.

59:53.791 --> 59:55.591
I doubt he even has a job here.

59:55.693 --> 59:57.526
Well, that doesn't sound
      like the guy I know.

59:57.628 --> 01:00:00.829
Because you don't actually
know him, Mom. He's playing you.

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:04.099
<i> He broke in</i>
 <i> to MJ's apartment last night.</i>

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:06.034
What?
   What are you talking about?

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:07.703
I was here.

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:10.606
He, he had a mask
         over his face,

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:12.674
but I know it was him.

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:14.009
Uh, okay,
    you don't make any sense.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.777
He was with me last night.

01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:18.447
-All night?
             -Yeah.

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:20.616
I mean, I don't know.
He went for a run at some point.

01:00:20.718 --> 01:00:22.618
Of course, he did.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.087
Listen to me, Mom,
      this man is dangerous

01:00:25.189 --> 01:00:27.189
and you should not be alone
            with him.

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:30.125
Okay. You know what?
        I can handle him.

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:32.928
-I'm coming over.
   -No, please, don't do that.

Going to my mom's.

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:43.472
Did she ask you to?

01:00:43.574 --> 01:00:44.906
-No.
             -Okay.

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:47.976
Well, then, don't go.
        Don't you get it?

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:50.812
This is a tinderbox and
  right now you're a lit match.

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:52.781
What is that supposed to mean?

01:00:54.485 --> 01:00:55.484
He's never harmed your mother.

01:00:55.586 --> 01:00:57.085
-Right?
              -No.

01:00:57.187 --> 01:00:59.454
From what you've told me,
    you're the one he hates.

01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:01.556
So why do you keep poking him
          with a stick?

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:03.158
Because I just can't do nothing.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.827
Yes, you can. Okay?

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:07.929
Take a deep breath. All right?

01:01:08.032 --> 01:01:09.965
-Relax.
            -[sighs]

01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:13.902
I'll drive a patrol car over
  there and I'll check on her.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.271
Okay?
   Everything's gonna be fine.

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:18.640
I'm not gonna let
        anything happen.

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:20.375
Okay.

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:28.784
Who were you, uh, talking to?

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:32.120
Oh, it was, it was Kristen.

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:35.691
Yeah? What did, uh,
    what did she have to say?

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:38.093
Oh, she's just
       checking up on me.

01:01:39.963 --> 01:01:41.630
Hey, come back to bed, okay?

01:01:41.732 --> 01:01:44.599
Mm, I don't really want to.

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:49.037
[Jake] Aah.

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:53.175
I mean, you can see
    what she's doing, right?

01:01:53.277 --> 01:01:56.278
She's just, she's just trying
        to stir stuff up.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.714
That's what she does.
        She's miserable.

01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:01.183
And she doesn't want
     you and I to be happy.

01:02:01.285 --> 01:02:03.518
-Don't do that.
            -Do what?

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.954
[Moira] Don't disrespect
       my daughter, ever.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:07.522
Do you understand?

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:10.358
I'm sorry.

01:02:10.461 --> 01:02:12.227
She's my everything.

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:15.197
Okay, I'm just... [sighs]

01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:18.800
I'm just sick of her
trying to poison you against me.

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:23.905
Did you change your name?

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:25.273
[scoffs]

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:27.609
Here we go.

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:32.247
-Did you?
    -Yeah. Yeah, I did, okay?

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:36.384
There are some things that I,
  I wanted to leave in my past.

01:02:36.487 --> 01:02:38.787
-A murder trial?
            -[scoffs]

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:44.593
Oh, come on.

01:02:46.797 --> 01:02:47.996
You know me. Okay?

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:49.397
I'm not, I'm not capable

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.565
of doing something like that.

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:53.168
The entire thing was just...

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.770
a nightmare.

01:02:54.872 --> 01:02:56.505
-Okay. Well, tell me.
         -You know what?

01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:58.774
I really don't like
     to talk about it, okay?

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:03.478
-Jake?
            -[sighs]

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.580
Come on. This is important.

01:03:08.051 --> 01:03:09.151
Fine.

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:13.188
It was the Fourth of July.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:16.691
Our neighbors were throwing
       their annual party.

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:20.262
Sarah... Look, she was walking
    alone in the dark, okay?

01:03:20.364 --> 01:03:23.632
Somebody followed her
     and, and strangled her.

01:03:23.734 --> 01:03:26.201
The entire thing was terrible.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:28.937
So why did they think
           it was you?

01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:34.042
[stammers] I kissed her
  that night, okay? That's it.

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:37.646
And then they blew the entire
    thing out of proportion.

01:03:37.748 --> 01:03:41.082
I mean, the whole,
 whole entire town turned on me.

01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:43.251
Do you have any idea
        what that's like,

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:47.322
to have people whispering
     about you all the time?

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:49.891
Even my parents.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:51.293
Even they started to believe
         that I did it.

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:53.428
In fact, to this day,

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:55.564
my mother thinks
    that I killed that girl.

01:03:57.434 --> 01:03:59.401
I thought you said
     your parents were dead.

01:04:01.905 --> 01:04:03.905
Because I wish that they were.

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:09.945
I keep trying to put
   my past behind me, but, no.

01:04:10.047 --> 01:04:13.782
It keeps coming back
  over and over and over again.

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:16.818
And nobody seems to care
      that I was acquitted

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.587
by a jury.

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:26.862
[scoffs]

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:30.165
So what are you thinkin'?

01:04:31.768 --> 01:04:35.637
I just need a little time
           by myself.

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:36.771
Okay?

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:52.487
He totally did it.

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:56.324
Wow. And you've been
 so objective up to this point.

01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:58.493
-[Ryan] How'd he get off?
         -Good lawyers.

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:00.262
They blamed everybody but Jake.

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:02.931
His brother, the sex offender
  who lived down the street...

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:05.433
They gave the jury
       a reasonable doubt.

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:09.638
-Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
      -I'm calling my mom.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.941
No. We're gonna catch this guy,
              okay?

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:16.544
Hey, I promise.

01:05:16.647 --> 01:05:18.647
Right now
     you need to be patient.

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:23.018
[dramatic music]

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:31.426
-[Jake] Reading anything good?
            -[gasps]

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:33.595
[chuckles]

01:05:33.697 --> 01:05:35.297
I'm sorry, I just...

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:39.301
I had to search
     and read it for myself.

01:05:39.403 --> 01:05:41.503
I get it.

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:43.638
You were gonna do it
        sooner or later.

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:49.110
[Jake sighs]

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.048
Is it true?

01:05:58.088 --> 01:05:59.854
Did you kill that girl?

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:00.989
[refrigerator door slams]

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:05.961
I told you already. No.

01:06:06.063 --> 01:06:07.762
[Moira] Well, it's because
     a lot of the articles,

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:10.732
the evidence implicates
          that you did.

01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:12.167
[sighs]

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:15.136
It was eight years ago.

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:18.306
I already went through a trial.
      Thank you very much.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:20.508
Jake, this isn't something
 I can just sweep under the rug.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:23.378
And I'm not asking you to!

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.748
I'm just asking you
         to believe me.

01:06:27.918 --> 01:06:30.085
This is just...

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:32.153
This isn't something
     I can handle right now.

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:36.524
Wait. No, no, no.
Come here, come here. Come here.

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:39.294
Are you, uh...

01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:40.929
breaking up with me?

01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:43.665
Well, it's not like this is...

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:45.667
a real relationship.

01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:49.204
Yeah.

01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:51.840
Right.

01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:56.044
You were just

01:06:56.146 --> 01:06:58.913
using me for sex.

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:01.282
Screw you!

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:06.354
You need to get out of here.

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:10.558
Okay. Fine. You know what?

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.628
This whole situation
      was starting to feel

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:16.865
a little bit old anyways.

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:50.665
Who are you texting, Ms. Moira?

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:52.267
It's none of your business.

01:07:54.071 --> 01:07:56.404
-No, get away from me!
         -Give it to me!

01:08:02.112 --> 01:08:05.013
-[Jake] Give it.
   -You don't have to do this.

01:08:05.115 --> 01:08:07.682
Yeah, I do

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:10.752
because you don't [cocks gun]
             listen.

01:08:19.563 --> 01:08:20.962
[chuckles]

01:08:22.499 --> 01:08:24.566
So this is what
      you think of me, huh?

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:27.635
That I'm like
      some kind of psycho?

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:28.937
You weren't supposed
         to read those.

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:30.839
Obviously, Moira.

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:35.176
Stand up.

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:39.613
No.

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.453
Okay.

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:48.223
-Come here. Get up!
          -[groans] Ow!

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:50.625
No! God, you're hurting me!

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:54.162
[chuckles] I thought
    you liked it rough, baby.

01:08:54.264 --> 01:08:56.231
-[chuckles]
         -God, you're...

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.634
Oh, just get out of here.

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:01.636
I can't do that. You know why?

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:04.005
Because your daughter,
       she stole from me.

01:09:04.107 --> 01:09:06.140
-She stole from us.
        -[message alert]

01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:09.109
Oh. Let's see who this is.

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:10.612
Oh, look.

01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:12.846
Poor little Kristen
        wants her mommy.

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:14.314
Okay, you could do anything
         you want to me.

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.317
But, see, don't you even realize

01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:19.254
that she started
        all the problems?

01:09:19.356 --> 01:09:22.423
You and I were just fine
      until she came along!

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:24.926
You're crazy.

01:09:25.028 --> 01:09:28.496
You know, I really,
 I really don't like that word.

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:30.365
Here, I think
     you're gonna need this.

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:33.600
I don't really wanna hurt you,
   just stand still. Stand...

01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:35.737
Oh, there it is.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.673
I guess I'll speak for you now.

"He's gone. I'm fine."
 No, wait, now what would you...

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:50.084
What would you say? Hurray?
  No. Um, what? Good riddance?

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:52.654
I got it.

01:09:52.756 --> 01:09:56.658
"Now I can get on with my life."

01:11:39.496 --> 01:11:42.196
[dramatic music]

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:43.464
Mom?

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:50.672
Mom?

01:11:54.411 --> 01:11:55.710
Mom?

01:11:56.713 --> 01:11:58.346
Where are you?

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:02.483
[door opens]

01:12:04.788 --> 01:12:06.387
[Jake sighs]

01:12:09.726 --> 01:12:11.993
Hey, sis.

01:12:12.095 --> 01:12:13.661
Where is my mother?

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:15.129
Mom!

01:12:15.231 --> 01:12:18.666
Mommy is just fine, all right?

01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:21.436
I wouldn't worry about her.

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:23.604
What did you do to her?

01:12:23.707 --> 01:12:25.573
Okay, if you would please

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:30.111
just stop yelling...

01:12:30.213 --> 01:12:33.414
And now, did you come alone?

01:12:34.584 --> 01:12:36.351
[whimpering]

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:37.618
Yes.

01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:39.053
Are you sure?

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:43.925
Where's, uh, Deputy Dog?

01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:46.394
I don't know.

01:12:49.265 --> 01:12:52.333
[music continues]

01:12:55.739 --> 01:12:58.005
Come on, baby, give me a signal.

01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:02.110
You do realize

01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:04.312
that you're the one

01:13:04.414 --> 01:13:07.248
who ruined everything?

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:16.057
I, I told you not to intervene.

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:17.492
But, no. What did you do?

01:13:17.594 --> 01:13:20.261
You went and you stole from me.

01:13:24.134 --> 01:13:26.701
This is Deputy Jessup
       requesting backup.

01:13:26.803 --> 01:13:29.036
Moira Atherton's house.
          Ludlow Road.

01:13:29.139 --> 01:13:32.140
[music continues]

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:38.579
Where's my sneaker?

01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:40.181
I don't have it. [whimpers]

01:13:40.283 --> 01:13:44.252
Do not play games with me.

01:13:53.329 --> 01:13:55.530
[creaking]

01:13:55.632 --> 01:13:57.598
[Kristen]
    I can go get it for you.

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:01.102
[door opens]

01:14:01.204 --> 01:14:02.537
No! No! Ryan!

01:14:02.639 --> 01:14:05.573
-[groans]
             -Ryan!

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:07.508
[groans]

01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:10.778
Run, Kristen!

01:14:14.284 --> 01:14:15.416
Mom?

01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:17.518
Mom, where are you?

01:14:21.858 --> 01:14:24.125
[Ryan groaning]

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.230
[Ryan groaning]

01:14:29.332 --> 01:14:30.698
Hey, buddy. You doing all right?

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.433
[Ryan breathing heavily]

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:35.102
Do you want me to call, uh,

01:14:35.205 --> 01:14:36.971
an ambulance or something?

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:39.574
Psycho! [breathing heavily]

01:14:39.676 --> 01:14:41.476
You better not hurt them.

01:14:43.079 --> 01:14:44.378
Or what?

01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:49.717
[Ryan groaning]

01:14:51.387 --> 01:14:53.488
You're not gonna get away
           with this.

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:56.824
What are you gonna do about it?

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:59.360
[breathing heavily]
  The police are on their way.

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:02.930
[Ryan groaning]

01:15:03.032 --> 01:15:04.932
Well, then, I guess
    I've got nothing to lose.

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:08.035
[breathing heavily]

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:17.578
Mom, where are you?

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:21.749
[panting]

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:42.603
[dramatic music]

01:15:47.477 --> 01:15:49.110
Oh, Kristen?

01:15:50.547 --> 01:15:52.179
I just wanna talk.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.384
[clattering]

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:05.192
[panting]

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:11.732
[music continues]

01:16:26.516 --> 01:16:28.649
[Jake laughs]

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:29.951
[Jake] Kristen...

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.754
Now you're starting
         to make me mad.

01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:40.728
-Ah!
             -Uh...

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:42.029
-Come here, you...
             -Uh...

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:43.130
[laughs]

01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:45.833
[muffled] Kristen!

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:49.937
You're pathetic!

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:51.339
[grunts]

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.508
[muffled] Kristen!

01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:57.411
You thought
     you would take me down.

01:16:57.513 --> 01:16:59.180
But guess what?

01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:01.315
You lose, bitch.

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:07.088
[groaning]

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:10.625
[breathing heavily]

01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:13.427
Get the hell off her!

01:17:13.529 --> 01:17:16.530
[grunting]

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:29.210
[grunting]

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:31.278
Mom. Mom!

01:17:31.381 --> 01:17:33.414
-Mom, stop! Mom, stop!
        -[siren wailing]

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:37.284
Mom, stop! Stop! Stop it!
      The police are here!

01:17:37.387 --> 01:17:40.388
[siren wailing]

01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:48.562
[birds chirping]

01:17:48.665 --> 01:17:51.699
[mellow music]

01:17:56.439 --> 01:17:59.407
Are you sure
      you're gonna be okay?

01:17:59.509 --> 01:18:00.808
Of course.

01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:03.444
'Cause I don't have to go.

01:18:03.546 --> 01:18:05.613
[laughs] Of course, you do.

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:08.449
Come on, this is
  a great opportunity for you.

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:11.118
UCLA is the perfect place.

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.654
I'm just gonna miss you,
           that's all.

01:18:13.756 --> 01:18:15.256
-Come here.
           -[sniffles]

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:21.929
So, ahem,

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:23.764
you just call me as soon
  as you get there, all right?

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:25.666
-Yes, I will.
             -Okay.

01:18:25.768 --> 01:18:28.869
Probably, before I get there.
     At the first rest stop.

01:18:30.139 --> 01:18:32.006
You're not worried about Jake?

01:18:32.108 --> 01:18:33.541
Oh, what? No.

01:18:33.643 --> 01:18:34.842
Because he's in prison

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:36.877
and they are not gonna
          let him out.

01:18:38.448 --> 01:18:39.780
I have a bunch of other tenants

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:41.449
coming to look at the place
         later on today.

01:18:41.551 --> 01:18:43.317
-So I won't be alone.
             -Okay.

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:44.785
Well, please be sure

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:46.987
you are thorough
      with the application.

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:48.723
I promise, I will.

01:18:51.294 --> 01:18:53.094
-I love you.
          -I love you.

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:57.031
[music continues]

01:18:57.767 --> 01:18:58.966
Okay.

01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:11.412
-Bye, Moira.
           -Bye, Ryan.

01:19:11.514 --> 01:19:13.848
Take care of our girl, okay?

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:15.983
I will. Don't worry.

01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:20.755
-Bye.
          -[Moira] Bye.

01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:23.390
You ready?

01:19:23.493 --> 01:19:26.494
Uh, I just don't like
       leaving her alone.

01:19:26.596 --> 01:19:29.263
Hey, she's not
      gonna be alone, okay?

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:31.565
She's gonna have a new tenant
           in no time.

01:19:31.667 --> 01:19:33.868
As soon as we get you settled
in, the first thing I'm gonna do

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:36.570
is come back here
     and check on her, okay?

01:19:36.672 --> 01:19:37.905
-Okay.
           -All right.

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:41.041
Okay. LA, here we come.

01:19:41.144 --> 01:19:43.844
-Let's go.
