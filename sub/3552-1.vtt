WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.203
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.203 --> 00:04.775
I WANNA GET THINGS RIGHT
THIS TIME.

00:04.775 --> 00:07.338
BREE'S RELATIONSHIP
WITH DETECTIVE VANCE

00:07.338 --> 00:09.640
GOT SERIOUS.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.512
WHAT ARE WE GONNA SAY
TO PEOPLE?

00:11.512 --> 00:14.715
TOM AND LYNETTE
DECIDED TO SEPARATE.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.687
WE SHOULDN'T TELL ANYONE
UNTIL WE TELL THE KIDS.

00:16.687 --> 00:19.150
OH, GOD. THE KIDS.

00:19.150 --> 00:20.721
SIT DOWN.
 OW!

00:20.721 --> 00:24.225
GABY'S STEPFATHER RETURNED
TO TERRORIZE HER AGAIN...

00:24.225 --> 00:26.457
I REMEMBER THOSE NIGHTS
IN YOUR ROOM, BABY.

00:26.457 --> 00:28.099
(crying) NO! STOP.

00:28.099 --> 00:29.260
UNTIL CARLOS STOPPED HIM...

00:29.260 --> 00:30.601
UHH!
 AAH!

00:30.601 --> 00:31.632
PERMANENTLY.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.564
(Bree) GABY?

00:33.564 --> 00:35.066
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:35.066 --> 00:37.638
I KILLED HIM.
 AND NOW HE'S GONNA GO TO JAIL

00:37.638 --> 00:39.210
BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT ME.

00:39.210 --> 00:41.212
CALM DOWN.
WE JUST NEED TIME TO THINK.

00:41.212 --> 00:42.743
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.116
YES, THERE WAS
THE DINNER PARTY.

00:45.116 --> 00:46.247
(Susan) EVERYBODY'S COMING.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.048
INCLUDING YOUR BOYFRIEND
THE DETECTIVE.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.750
I KILLED THE SON OF A BITCH
WHO HURT MY WIFE.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.552
IF I HAVE TO GO TO PRISON,
I WILL.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.484
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

01:05.135 --> 01:06.797
(Mary Alice)
EVERY HOSTESS KNOWS

01:06.797 --> 01:11.372
THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE
AFTER THE GUESTS LEAVE A PARTY.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.076
AND ONLY THE BEST OF FRIENDS

01:16.076 --> 01:19.480
WILL STAY LONG
AFTER THE PARTY'S OVER...

01:21.482 --> 01:23.754
TO HELP CLEAN UP THE MESS.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.562
THEY HELP
WITH THE HEAVY LIFTING...

01:33.264 --> 01:37.228
THEY WORK TOGETHER
TO LIGHTEN THE LOAD.

01:38.799 --> 01:43.774
THEY TAKE ON
THE MOST UNPLEASANT TASKS.

01:46.137 --> 01:50.211
AND, OF COURSE, THERE'S NO TASK
MORE UNPLEASANT...

01:50.211 --> 01:51.682
(Gaby grunts)

01:51.682 --> 01:54.885
THAN GETTING RID
OF AN UNWANTED GUEST.

01:54.885 --> 01:57.488
(exhales deeply)

01:57.488 --> 01:58.549
I SHOULD GO MOVE THE CAR
OFF THE TRAIL.

01:58.549 --> 02:00.321
YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.157
IS THIS HAPPENING?

02:06.157 --> 02:08.299
(whispers)
ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS?

02:08.299 --> 02:10.401
(lowered voice)
EVERYONE STAY FOCUSED.

02:10.401 --> 02:11.432
THE HARDEST PART IS OVER.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.564
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS FILL THIS IN.

02:15.866 --> 02:18.609
(cell phone rings)

02:18.609 --> 02:20.641
(ring)

02:20.641 --> 02:24.175
(ring)

02:24.175 --> 02:25.516
(ring)

02:25.516 --> 02:27.248
OH, MY GOD.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.220
(ring)
 I THOUGHT I GOT EVERYTHING.

02:29.220 --> 02:30.621
NO.
 (ring)

02:30.621 --> 02:32.253
NO, YOU MISSED THE PHONE.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.785
(ring)
 AND IF YOU MISSED THAT,
WHAT ELSE DID YOU MISS?

02:34.785 --> 02:36.427
SUSAN, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
 (ring)

02:36.427 --> 02:41.161
HOW IS IT GOING TO BE OKAY?
SOMEONE IS CALLING THE DEAD GUY.
 (ring)

02:41.161 --> 02:42.333
(beep, ringing stops)

02:42.333 --> 02:43.494
"HOME."
 SEE?

02:43.494 --> 02:46.367
HE HAS A HOME...
WITH PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT HIM,

02:46.367 --> 02:48.799
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO COME
LOOKING FOR HIM,

02:48.799 --> 02:50.571
LEADING THEM STRAIGHT TO US.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.842
WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?

02:51.842 --> 02:53.204
IT'S NOT TOO LATE. WE...

02:53.204 --> 02:55.175
WE COULD STILL GO
TO THE POLICE.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.208
AND SEND MY HUSBAND
BACK TO PRISON?

02:57.208 --> 02:58.749
THIS TIME FOR MURDER?

02:58.749 --> 03:00.511
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

03:00.511 --> 03:01.652
HE BROKE INTO YOUR HOUSE.
HE THREATENED YOU.

03:01.652 --> 03:03.414
WE COULD EXPLAIN THAT.

03:03.414 --> 03:06.186
YEAH, THEN WE CAN EXPLAIN
HOW WE DUMPED HIM IN A TRUNK,

03:06.186 --> 03:08.889
ATE SOME CHEESECAKE,
AND BURIED HIM IN THE WOODS!

03:08.889 --> 03:12.723
WE ARE GOING TO GET CAUGHT.
PEOPLE ALWAYS GET CAUGHT.

03:12.723 --> 03:14.365
WE CAN'T DO THIS.

03:14.365 --> 03:16.827
WE'RE NOT CRIMINALS.
WE DRIVE CARPOOL.

03:16.827 --> 03:18.899
THAT'S ENOUGH.

03:18.899 --> 03:22.333
THIS IS A VERY BAD MAN.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.905
HE ATTACKED OUR FRIEND,
AND HER HUSBAND PROTECTED HER,

03:24.905 --> 03:27.207
AND NOW WE ARE
GONNA PROTECT THEM.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.383
THAT MEANS WE TELL NO ONE.

03:32.383 --> 03:35.246
(whispering) NOT THE POLICE...

03:35.246 --> 03:37.418
NOT OUR FAMILIES.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.220
NO ONE.

03:41.692 --> 03:42.953
(normal voice)
WHEN WE BURY THE BODY,

03:42.953 --> 03:45.256
WE BURY THE SECRET FOREVER.

04:03.774 --> 04:04.915
SUSAN?

04:12.353 --> 04:13.684
(sighs)

04:20.430 --> 04:22.793
YES, IT'S ONLY
THE BEST OF FRIENDS

04:22.793 --> 04:25.866
WHO STAY LONG
AFTER THE PARTY'S OVER

04:25.866 --> 04:28.339
TO HELP CLEAN UP THE MESS...

04:29.840 --> 04:33.404
EVEN WHEN THAT MESS
MAY BE BIGGER

04:33.404 --> 04:36.276
THAN THEY BARGAINED FOR.

04:47.057 --> 04:51.362
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT CHANGE
DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT,

04:51.362 --> 04:54.465
BUT OVER THE COURSE OF MONTH,
IT'S AMAZING

04:54.465 --> 04:57.528
HOW MUCH THE GROUND
CAN SHIFT BENEATH US.

04:59.370 --> 05:01.932
A WOMAN WHO HELPED
CONCEAL A CRIME

05:01.932 --> 05:05.576
IS NOW SLEEPING
WITH A DETECTIVE.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.880
A MAN WHO USED TO LOOK FORWARD
TO BEDTIME...

05:09.880 --> 05:13.544
IS NOW FINDING HIMSELF
DREADING IT.

05:14.885 --> 05:18.589
A WOMAN WHO ONCE
TOLD HER HUSBAND EVERYTHING

05:18.589 --> 05:22.423
IS NOW KEEPING
A TERRIBLE SECRET.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.499
AND A COUPLE
WHO HAVE DECIDED TO SEPARATE

05:28.499 --> 05:31.432
IS NOW GOING TO GREAT LENGTHS
TO SHOW

05:31.432 --> 05:34.605
THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

05:39.039 --> 05:42.072
CRAP! CRAP! CRAP! CRAP!

05:48.779 --> 05:52.352
(thud)
 AAH! SON OF A...

06:04.435 --> 06:07.367
(door opens)

06:07.367 --> 06:08.599
HEY, HEY, HEY, GUYS!

06:08.599 --> 06:11.371
GOT UP EARLY,
SO I FIGURED, WHAT THE HECK?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.574
I'LL GO GET YOUR MOM
SOME COFFEE--THE GOOD STUFF.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.875
SHE DESERVES IT.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.778
SHE NEEDS IT, TOO.
I DIDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.750
BUT YOU WOULD KNOW THAT.
YOU WERE THERE.

06:19.750 --> 06:20.751
(chuckles nervously)

06:20.751 --> 06:21.852
(lowered voice)
DO NOT DRINK THIS.

06:21.852 --> 06:23.083
IT'S BEEN IN MY CAR
FOR THREE DAYS.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.917
WHERE ARE YOUR SHOES, DAD?

06:26.917 --> 06:29.990
(normal voice)
IT'S CASUAL FRIDAY. (chuckles)

06:29.990 --> 06:31.662
CASUAL THURSDAY.

06:31.662 --> 06:35.666
COME ON.
WE'RE GONNA MISS THE BUS.

06:35.666 --> 06:37.027
SEE YA LATER.
I'LL SEE YA AT DINNER.

06:37.027 --> 06:38.429
LOVE YOU.

06:38.429 --> 06:39.470
(chuckles)
 (door closes)

06:39.470 --> 06:41.972
GOD, I PRACTICALLY LOST A TOE
OUT THERE.

06:41.972 --> 06:44.675
IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
IF YOU HADN'T OVERSLEPT.

06:44.675 --> 06:47.037
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU TOOK THE GOOD ALARM CLOCK

06:47.037 --> 06:49.510
ALONG WITH THE GOOD PILLOW
AND THE HOUSE.

06:49.510 --> 06:53.614
THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WE HAVE TO
TELL THE KIDS WE'VE SEPARATED.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.986
WE WILL, BUT THIS WEEKEND
IS GABY'S BIG BARBECUE,

06:55.986 --> 06:58.188
AND I DON'T WANNA RUIN IT
FOR THEM.

06:58.188 --> 06:59.450
YEAH, AND LAST WEEKEND,

06:59.450 --> 07:01.091
YOU DIDN'T WANNA RUIN
THE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT.

07:01.091 --> 07:02.553
THE WEEKEND BEFORE THAT,
PENNY'S BIRTHDAY.

07:02.553 --> 07:05.856
COME ON, LYNETTE. ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS ABOUT THE KIDS?

07:05.856 --> 07:08.799
WHAT ELSE WOULD IT BE?

07:08.799 --> 07:10.701
NO, TOM, NOTHING'S CHANGED.

07:10.701 --> 07:13.604
WE STILL NEED TIME
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

07:13.604 --> 07:15.105
YEAH, I AGREE. WE GOT A LOT
OF PROBLEMS TO WORK OUT,

07:15.105 --> 07:17.608
SO WHY CAN'T
WE TELL THE KIDS?

07:17.608 --> 07:20.471
I JUST THINK THEY DESERVE
ONE MORE HAPPY WEEKEND

07:20.471 --> 07:22.743
BEFORE WE TEAR
THIS FAMILY APART.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.845
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE--
 (Paige crying in distance)

07:24.845 --> 07:26.517
PAIGE IS UP.

07:26.517 --> 07:29.079
(crying continues)

07:29.079 --> 07:30.621
MMM.

07:30.621 --> 07:32.022
MMM.
 MMM.

07:32.022 --> 07:35.526
DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

07:35.526 --> 07:37.888
BUT YOU COULD DO THIS
PROFESSIONALLY.

07:37.888 --> 07:40.190
COMING FROM A MAN
WHO'S ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS

07:40.190 --> 07:42.733
WITH HALF THE HOOKERS
IN FAIRVIEW,

07:42.733 --> 07:45.465
THAT'S QUITE A COMPLIMENT,
DETECTIVE.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.938
HEY, I WAS THINKING
MAYBE THIS WEEKEND,

07:47.938 --> 07:50.070
WE COULD HEAD UP TO THAT PLACE
IN THE MOUNTAINS,

07:50.070 --> 07:51.241
JUST THE TWO OF US.

07:51.241 --> 07:53.243
OH, THAT SOUNDS LOVELY,
BUT GABY IS HAVING

07:53.243 --> 07:56.977
HER ANNUAL BARBECUE
ON SATURDAY.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.579
AM I INVITED?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.250
OF COURSE YOU ARE.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE?

08:00.250 --> 08:03.984
OH, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE BECAUSE
YOUR FRIENDS DON'T LIKE ME.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.657
WHAT?
YOU ARE IMAGINING THINGS.

08:06.657 --> 08:08.158
IT'S TRUE.

08:08.158 --> 08:11.522
THEY DON'T TALK TO ME.
THEY DON'T MAKE EYE CONTACT.

08:11.522 --> 08:13.263
IT'S BEEN THAT WAY
FOR WEEKS,

08:13.263 --> 08:15.826
EVER SINCE THE NIGHT
OF THE DINNER PARTY.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.669
(whispers) WHY...

08:18.669 --> 08:20.500
(normal voice)
UH, WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.834
BREE, I'M A COP. I GOT
AN EYE FOR HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.677
THAT WAS WHEN
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

08:26.677 --> 08:29.880
(sighs) I JUST
CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.082
I KEEP GOING OVER THAT NIGHT,
HOUR BY HOUR.

08:33.082 --> 08:36.515
WELL,STOP...(chuckles)
GOING OVER THAT NIGHT,

08:36.515 --> 08:38.989
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS FINE.

08:38.989 --> 08:41.621
THE GIRLS ARE JUST AS CRAZY
ABOUT YOU AS I AM.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.294
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT FEELING IT.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.829
WELL...

08:48.829 --> 08:51.301
ARE YOU FEELING THIS?

08:53.704 --> 08:56.536
OH.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.038
BREE,
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.040
YOU'RE TRYING TO DISTRACT ME
WITH SEX,

09:00.040 --> 09:01.572
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE...

09:01.572 --> 09:04.144
(giggles) MMM.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.777
BRING IT ON.

09:09.780 --> 09:12.583
WAKE UP! I MADE YOU WAFFLES.

09:12.583 --> 09:15.856
COME BACK WHEN
YOU LEARN HOW TO MAKE MIMOSAS.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.327
COME ON! I LEFT CELIA
ALONE WITH THEM.

09:17.327 --> 09:18.959
THERE WON'T BE ANY LEFT.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.861
DAMN IT, JUANITA!
THAT'S ENOUGH!

09:20.861 --> 09:23.293
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!

09:25.135 --> 09:27.037
CARLOS!

09:27.037 --> 09:30.040
(sighs) JUANITA, HONEY,
I'M SORRY!

09:30.040 --> 09:33.343
WHY HAVE YOU BEEN
SO SHORT-TEMPERED LATELY?

09:33.343 --> 09:36.176
GOSH, I DON'T KNOW.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.208
MAYBE I'M UPSET
ABOUT MY GOLF SWING

09:38.208 --> 09:40.751
OR THE ECONOMY...

09:40.751 --> 09:43.213
OR MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
I KILLED A GUY.

09:43.213 --> 09:45.856
LOOK, I GET IT, OKAY?

09:45.856 --> 09:48.118
BUT WE HAVE TO MOVE ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

09:48.118 --> 09:51.591
DON'T YOU THINK I WANT TO?

09:51.591 --> 09:52.993
I JUST CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT THIS.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.665
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,

09:54.665 --> 09:59.369
IT'S THIS HORRIBLE THING
THAT IS ALWAYS THERE.

09:59.369 --> 10:01.632
I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE.

10:01.632 --> 10:04.775
I KNOW A GUY NAMED TOM COLLINS.
HE'S A GREAT LISTENER.

10:04.775 --> 10:06.837
I MEANT FATHER DUGAN.

10:06.837 --> 10:09.279
OKAY, ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE.

10:09.279 --> 10:11.011
THAT'S TOO RISKY.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.714
A PRIEST CAN'T SHARE
WHAT YOU SAY IN CONFESSION.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.246
ARE YOU SURE HE'S NOT JUST
GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTIER?

10:16.246 --> 10:17.748
I MEAN, THAT'S THEIR THING.

10:20.691 --> 10:22.993
(sighs) FINE.
WE'LL GO SEE THE PRIEST.

10:24.254 --> 10:26.727
I HAVE TO.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.660
I'M TURNING INTO
A TERRIBLE HUSBAND, FATHER.

10:31.301 --> 10:33.704
I NEED TO GET THIS
OFF MY CONSCIENCE.

10:33.704 --> 10:35.635
IT'S TEARING ME APART.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.115
(squeaking)

10:45.115 --> 10:47.177
(sighs)

10:47.177 --> 10:49.379
(squeaking continues)

10:49.379 --> 10:53.653
(sighs) SUSAN.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.325
OH. I WAS LOOKING OUT
THE WINDOW,

10:55.325 --> 10:57.788
AND I NOTICED DUST IN THE CORNER
OF EACH WINDOWPANE.

10:57.788 --> 10:59.730
IT'S BEEN DRIVING ME NUTS.

10:59.730 --> 11:03.794
(yawns) OKAY.

11:03.794 --> 11:05.195
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

11:05.195 --> 11:06.666
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.038
WELL, THERE'S A LOT
OF WEIRD STUFF

11:08.038 --> 11:09.399
YOU LIKE TO DO
IN THE BEDROOM,

11:09.399 --> 11:12.042
BUT CLEANING--
NOT SO MUCH.

11:12.042 --> 11:14.004
COULDN'T SLEEP.

11:14.004 --> 11:16.747
YEAH, THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
A LOT LATELY.

11:16.747 --> 11:18.148
YOU DON'T SLEEP.
YOU DON'T EAT.

11:18.148 --> 11:19.850
YOU NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE.

11:19.850 --> 11:23.113
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I'M SUBSTITUTE TEACHING TODAY.

11:23.113 --> 11:27.087
AND THAT'S GREAT, BUT...
(sighs)

11:27.087 --> 11:28.819
DID YOU HAVE A FIGHT
WITH THE GIRLS?

11:28.819 --> 11:30.690
WHAT?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.793
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.865
WELL, A MONTH AGO,

11:34.865 --> 11:36.296
YOU WERE SO EXCITED
TO MOVE BACK TO THE LANE,

11:36.296 --> 11:39.169
AND NOW YOU NEVER SEE 'EM.

11:39.169 --> 11:41.872
THERE'S... NO COFFEE, NO POKER,

11:41.872 --> 11:46.236
NO... BITCHING ABOUT HUSBANDS
OVER COFFEE AND POKER.

11:46.236 --> 11:48.979
THE GIRLS AND I ARE FINE.

11:48.979 --> 11:51.311
THEN WHAT IS IT?

11:53.713 --> 11:56.286
COME ON, SUSAN. IT'S ME.

11:56.286 --> 11:58.288
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

12:01.191 --> 12:02.953
I'M GOING FOR A RUN.

12:02.953 --> 12:05.225
(sighs) SUSAN.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.829
WELL, YOU SAID I SHOULD
GET OUT OF THE HOUSE MORE.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.862
(sighs)

12:30.420 --> 12:32.052
(sighs deeply)

12:46.937 --> 12:47.998
HEY.

12:47.998 --> 12:49.239
SO WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THE NEW GUY?

12:49.239 --> 12:51.171
DEFINITELY RICH.
CHECK OUT THE CAR.

12:52.943 --> 12:55.045
DEFINITELY SINGLE.
CHECK OUT THE FISH.

12:55.045 --> 12:57.978
RICHANDSINGLE--

12:57.978 --> 13:00.851
I WONDER WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.
YOU RARELY GET THE TRIFECTA.

13:00.851 --> 13:02.152
WHAT'S YOUR GUESS?

13:02.152 --> 13:04.154
WONKY EYE? RABBIT TEETH?
COMB-OVER?

13:04.154 --> 13:07.117
ONE NORMAL EYEBROW,
ONE REALLY BIG ONE?

13:07.117 --> 13:08.118
BABY HANDS?

13:10.160 --> 13:12.893
I HAD IT ALL ON ONE GUY.
DID NOT END WELL.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.896
(chuckles) WELL, I ACTUALLY SAW
OUR NEW NEIGHBOR THIS MORNING.

13:15.896 --> 13:16.997
HMM.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.128
6'1". 190.

13:18.128 --> 13:21.071
HE WAS WEARING THIS
GREAT-LOOKING PAIR OF JEANS.

13:21.071 --> 13:22.232
AND LET ME JUST SAY,

13:22.232 --> 13:23.974
I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING
THAT ISN'T WONKY.

13:23.974 --> 13:25.005
(laughs)

13:25.005 --> 13:26.506
GABY.
 (laughs)

13:26.506 --> 13:28.538
OH, COME ON. I'M MARRIED.
I'M NOT DEAD.

13:28.538 --> 13:31.311
CAN STILL IMAGINE ALL
THE DIRTY THINGS I'D DO TO HIM.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.183
LIKE WHAT?
 OH, GOD!

13:33.183 --> 13:35.886
OH! (laughs)
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE...

13:35.886 --> 13:36.887
AH.

13:36.887 --> 13:39.519
(giggles) I'M SUSAN DELFINO.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.221
NICE TO MEET YOU.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.252
BEN FAULKNER.

13:42.252 --> 13:43.223
HI.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.195
WELL, I'M ACTUALLY 6'2",

13:45.195 --> 13:47.097
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN 190
SINCE I PLAYED RUGBY,

13:47.097 --> 13:48.258
BUT, UH, THANK YOU.

13:48.258 --> 13:50.360
(chuckles)
 UH, AND AS FOR THE JEANS,

13:50.360 --> 13:51.902
YOU KNOW,
I COULD NEVER FIGURE OUT

13:51.902 --> 13:55.235
WHY THEY WOULD COST 200 BUCKS.
NOW I KNOW.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.366
(all giggling)

13:56.366 --> 13:57.968
LADIES,

13:57.968 --> 13:58.969
EXCUSE ME.

13:58.969 --> 13:59.970
OH.
 OKAY.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.111
THANKS.

14:01.111 --> 14:03.173
(Lynette) WELCOME.

14:03.173 --> 14:05.575
(sighs) DIBS.

14:05.575 --> 14:07.617
(chuckles)

14:07.617 --> 14:09.249
LOOK WHO'S OUT.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.151
(Gaby) HEY, SUSAN!

14:11.151 --> 14:12.983
UH, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO JOIN US FOR COFFEE?!

14:12.983 --> 14:14.925
UH, SORRY. I CAN'T TALK.

14:14.925 --> 14:16.987
I'M SUBBING TODAY!
CAN'T BE LATE!

14:16.987 --> 14:19.459
(sighs) IS ANYONE
TALKING TO HER?

14:19.459 --> 14:21.161
I TRIED. SHE'S NOT
RETURNING MY CALLS.

14:21.161 --> 14:24.164
SAME HERE.
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY AVOIDING US.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.266
I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT IS ONE LOOSE CANNON.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.268
WELL, WE HAVE GOT TO GET HER
BACK IN THE FOLD.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.071
THIS IS TOO RISKY.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.343
SAYS THE WOMAN
WHO'S DATING A COP.

14:33.343 --> 14:37.207
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT IT
MIGHT BE GOOD TO KEEP HIM CLOSE?

14:37.207 --> 14:38.608
IF THERE'S EVER
AN INVESTIGATION,

14:38.608 --> 14:40.450
I WILL BE THE FIRST
TO KNOW.

14:42.212 --> 14:44.214
I'M DOING THIS FOR US.

14:44.214 --> 14:46.917
HE'S THAT GOOD IN THE SACK?

14:46.917 --> 14:49.389
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

14:51.521 --> 14:54.064
AND WHEN YOU FINISH
YOUR WORKSHEETS ON LADYBUGS,

14:54.064 --> 14:57.597
WE WILL GO OUTSIDE
AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOME.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.331
SUSAN, HOW'S IT GOING?

15:01.331 --> 15:03.073
GOOD.

15:03.073 --> 15:04.674
IT'S NICE TO BE BACK.

15:04.674 --> 15:06.136
(lowered voice)
TO BE HONEST,

15:06.136 --> 15:08.038
I'VE BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE DOWN LATELY.

15:08.038 --> 15:09.980
THIS IS JUST WHAT I NEEDED.
(chuckles)

15:09.980 --> 15:11.381
MRS. DELFINO?

15:11.381 --> 15:13.183
CUPCAKE'S NOT MOVING.

15:13.183 --> 15:15.015
SHE'S PROBABLY SLEEPING, HONEY.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.217
NO, I POKED HER WITH MY PENCIL
A COUPLE TIMES.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.249
SHE IS D-E-A DEAD.

15:19.249 --> 15:24.124
UH... IT'S OKAY, KIDS.
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.555
OH, MY GOD. WHAT DO I DO?

15:25.555 --> 15:26.656
THERE'S A LITTLE SPOT
IN THE GARDEN

15:26.656 --> 15:28.328
WHERE WE BURY
THE CLASS PETS.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.261
BURY?
 YEAH.

15:31.261 --> 15:33.403
HAVE A LITTLE FUNERAL.
SAY A FEW WORDS.

15:33.403 --> 15:35.065
JUST DON'T MENTION GOD.

15:35.065 --> 15:39.269
AMANDA'S PARENTS ARE ATHEISTS,
LAWYERS, AND MAJOR DOUCHES.

15:47.017 --> 15:49.219
BLESS ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

15:49.219 --> 15:50.950
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE MY LAST CONFESSION.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.553
CONTINUE, MY SON.
(snorts)

15:53.553 --> 15:55.325
"MY SON." I'M SORRY.

15:55.325 --> 15:59.029
IT'S JUST YOU'RE, LIKE,
A THOUSAND YEARS OLDER THAN ME.

16:00.430 --> 16:02.492
WHO ARE YOU
AND WHERE'S FATHER DUGAN?

16:02.492 --> 16:05.065
LEAVING ON SABBATICAL.
FUN FOR HIM AND FUN FOR ME.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.297
THIS IS MY FIRST WEEK
OF CONFESSIONS.

16:07.297 --> 16:08.738
IT IS?

16:08.738 --> 16:11.341
YEAH, AND, MAN,
THE THINGS I'VE HEARD.

16:11.341 --> 16:12.972
THERE WAS
A LADY YESTERDAY WHO--

16:14.574 --> 16:16.276
NO, NO, NO, I CAN'T SAY IT.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.278
I THINK I'LL COME BACK.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.350
UNH-UNH. NO.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

16:20.350 --> 16:21.511
I TOLD YOU TO WAIT IN THE CAR.

16:21.511 --> 16:24.214
DON'T SNAP AT ME.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

16:24.214 --> 16:25.985
YOU KEEP SAYING YOU WANNA TALK
TO SOMEONE, SO TALK TO THIS GUY.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.488
HE SEEMS PERFECTLY...
ENTHUSIASTIC.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.291
HE'S 12 YEARS OLD.
THIS WILL BLOW HIS COLLAR OFF.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.293
OH, MAN,
THIS MUST BE AWESOME.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.265
I'M SO BUMMED
I CAN'T TWEET ANYMORE.

16:35.265 --> 16:37.997
SORRY. IF IT'S NOT FATHER DUGAN,
I'M NOT DOING THIS.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.229
NO--
 LET'S GO.

16:39.229 --> 16:41.371
(door opens)
 NUTS.

16:41.371 --> 16:43.633
I WAS REALLY HOPING
THIS WOULD BE A GOOD ONE.

16:43.633 --> 16:46.506
I MADE OUT WITH TWO CHICKS
ONCE IN COLLEGE.

16:48.438 --> 16:50.510
(whispers) THIS JOB ROCKS!

16:58.088 --> 16:59.289
UH...

16:59.289 --> 17:01.421
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER
BURIED ANYTHING BEFORE,

17:01.421 --> 17:03.393
BUT YOU HAVE TO DIG A HOLE.

17:05.194 --> 17:08.428
RIGHT. OF COURSE.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.560
I KNEW THAT.

17:17.207 --> 17:20.039
IT'S FUNNY THE WAY LIFE
WORKS OUT SOMETIMES, ISN'T IT?

17:20.039 --> 17:22.372
(sighs)

17:22.372 --> 17:26.146
I MEAN, I WASN'T EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TODAY.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.580
ONCE AGAIN, IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.

17:32.582 --> 17:34.454
(voice breaking) NOW I HAVE TO
CARRY THIS AROUND WITH ME

17:34.454 --> 17:36.556
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.828
DON'T BE SAD, MRS. DELFINO.

17:38.828 --> 17:41.091
CUPCAKE WAS KIND OF
A BAD HAMSTER.

17:41.091 --> 17:43.263
SHE HAD THREE BABIES
AND ATE THEM.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.495
BUT DOES THAT MEAN
SHE DESERVED TO DIE?

17:45.495 --> 17:48.067
WE DON'T GET TO MAKE
THAT CALL, JUANITA.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.739
WE'RE NOT GOD.

17:49.739 --> 17:52.172
THAT'S RIGHT, AMANDA.
I SAID IT.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.349
(sobbing)
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

17:59.349 --> 18:00.610
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

18:00.610 --> 18:01.811
I KNOW IT'S NOT MY FAULT,

18:01.811 --> 18:03.753
BUT TRY TELLING THAT
TO CUPCAKE'S FAMILY

18:03.753 --> 18:06.556
WHEN THEY SHOW UP
LOOKING FOR HER.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.362
THERE.

18:12.362 --> 18:13.363
WE'RE DONE.

18:13.363 --> 18:15.225
NOW LET'S ALL SLAP ON
A HAPPY FACE

18:15.225 --> 18:17.467
AND PRETEND LIKE
THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.777
(singsongy) CAN I COME IN?

18:27.777 --> 18:30.780
I'M REALLY NOT FEELING
LIKE DRINKING RIGHT NOW.

18:30.780 --> 18:33.613
GREAT. MMM.

18:37.187 --> 18:40.320
SO... WERE YOU TWO CLOSE?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.821
PARDON?

18:41.821 --> 18:43.493
YOU AND CUPCAKE.

18:43.493 --> 18:45.355
JUANITA TOLD ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

18:45.355 --> 18:46.226
(chuckles nervously)

18:46.226 --> 18:48.228
I ASSUME YOU TWO
HAD A LONG HISTORY,

18:48.228 --> 18:51.331
WENT TO COLLEGE TOGETHER,
BACKPACKED THROUGH EUROPE.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.864
IT JUST SORT OF HIT ME
IN A WEIRD WAY.

18:56.766 --> 18:58.868
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

18:58.868 --> 19:00.440
FIRST, YOU STOP TALKING
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.372
NOW YOU'RE WIGGING OUT
AT A RAT FUNERAL.

19:02.372 --> 19:03.643
YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.316
WELL, I'M SORRY I'M NOT
HANDLING ACCESSORY TO MURDER

19:06.316 --> 19:07.877
AS WELL AS THE REST OF YOU.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.721
(lowered voice)
SUSAN, I'M BEGGING YOU.

19:11.721 --> 19:14.524
THIS IS MY HUSBAND'S LIFE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

19:14.524 --> 19:16.886
IF ANYTHING
WERE TO HAPPEN TO HIM,

19:16.886 --> 19:19.359
THINK OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
TO ME AND MY GIRLS.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.732
I KNOW YOU'RE HAVING
A HARD TIME,

19:22.732 --> 19:24.894
BUT PLEASE HOLD IT TOGETHER.

19:24.894 --> 19:27.337
I'M TRYING.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.270
TRY HARDER.

19:35.905 --> 19:38.308
(sighs)

19:38.308 --> 19:39.949
(door closes)
 BREE?

19:39.949 --> 19:41.951
DO I SMELL...

19:41.951 --> 19:44.754
YES, WHITE CHOCOLATE
MACADAMIA NUT--YOUR FAVORITE.

19:44.754 --> 19:46.185
OH!
 (chuckles)

19:46.185 --> 19:48.358
NOWYOU'REMY FAVORITE.
MWAH.

19:48.358 --> 19:49.689
HMM.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.361
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

19:51.361 --> 19:54.524
(mouth full) TERRIFIC.
I FOUND A DEAD BODY.

19:55.865 --> 19:57.297
OH, I'M--I'M SORRY.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.368
YOU DON'T
WANNA HEAR ABOUT THIS.

19:58.368 --> 20:01.471
NO, I DO.
YOUR WORK IS FASCINATING.

20:01.471 --> 20:05.675
SO, UM, WHERE EXACTLY
DID YOU FIND THIS BODY?

20:05.675 --> 20:08.878
WAREHOUSE OUT BY THE DOCKS.

20:08.878 --> 20:11.941
SO NOW I'M A BIG HERO
BECAUSE I CRACKED A CASE

20:11.941 --> 20:13.443
THOSE POOR BASTARDS
IN NEW HAVEN P.D.

20:13.443 --> 20:14.484
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON
FOR MONTHS.

20:14.484 --> 20:15.845
OH, GOOD FOR YOU.

20:15.845 --> 20:17.847
MM. I GOT LUCKY.

20:17.847 --> 20:21.291
ALL I DID WAS SPOT A SEDAN
WITH CONNECTICUT PLATES,

20:21.291 --> 20:22.422
A BUNCH OF TICKETS
ON THE WINDSHIELD,

20:22.422 --> 20:26.496
AND I ASKED MYSELF,
"WHO OWNS THAT CAR?"

20:26.496 --> 20:27.797
THE DEAD MAN HAD A CAR.

20:27.797 --> 20:29.699
EXACTLY. THE KILLERS
DID EVERYTHING RIGHT,

20:29.699 --> 20:32.302
BUT THEY FORGOT TO GET RID
OF THE VICTIM'S RIDE.

20:32.302 --> 20:33.963
(chuckles nervously)
WHAT IDIOTS.

20:33.963 --> 20:35.335
MM-HMM.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.437
SO YOU KEPT HIS KEYS,

20:37.437 --> 20:39.509
BUT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU
HE MIGHT HAVE A CAR.

20:39.509 --> 20:41.240
I JUST THREW ALL HIS STUFF
IN OUR SAFE.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.342
I DIDN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME
THINKING ABOUT IT.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.344
(alarm chirps)

20:44.344 --> 20:45.475
THERE IT IS.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.948
OKAY, WHAT'S OUR PLAN?

20:48.948 --> 20:50.620
DROP IT OFF
IN A BAD PART OF TOWN,

20:50.620 --> 20:54.354
AND LET SOCIAL DECAY...
(whispers) TAKE ITS COURSE.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.255
OH, GOD,
DO YOU HAVE TO TIDY UP?

20:56.255 --> 20:59.959
GETIN.IF ANYBODY CATCHES US
IN THIS CAR, WE'RE DEAD.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.932
(gasps)

21:02.932 --> 21:04.464
OH, NO, IT'S A STICK.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.995
I CAN'T DRIVE A STICK.
CAN YOU?

21:05.995 --> 21:07.667
I DID ONCE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.740
IT'S EASY.
JUST ONE EXTRA PEDAL.

21:10.740 --> 21:11.841
(brakes screech)

21:11.841 --> 21:13.673
(grinding sound, screeching)

21:13.673 --> 21:15.445
OH.

21:15.445 --> 21:16.546
(screeching continues)

21:16.546 --> 21:17.947
IT WAS EASIER
WHEN I WAS DRUNK.

21:17.947 --> 21:19.048
(grinding)

21:19.048 --> 21:20.450
(screeching)

21:20.450 --> 21:21.451
(sighs)

21:21.451 --> 21:22.782
(siren wailing)

21:22.782 --> 21:24.584
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.687
(screeching and wailing
continue)

21:27.687 --> 21:30.019
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
SHOULD I GUN IT?

21:30.019 --> 21:33.423
GUN IT?
YOU CAN'T EVEN DRIVE IT.

21:39.569 --> 21:41.571
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

21:44.474 --> 21:47.477
CHUCK. LOOK, GABY,
IT'S CHUCK.
 MM.

21:47.477 --> 21:50.680
I-I SAW
YOU WERE STRUGGLING.

21:50.680 --> 21:51.781
WHOSE CAR IS THIS?

21:51.781 --> 21:54.313
MY AUNT'S.
 MY FRIEND'S.

21:55.585 --> 21:57.887
HER AUNT AND MY FRIEND.

21:57.887 --> 21:59.419
AUNT SHIRLEY. (chuckles)

21:59.419 --> 22:03.393
SHE, UH, CAME OVER TO MY PLACE
LAST NIGHT FOR BOOK CLUB, AND--

22:03.393 --> 22:04.754
SHE HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

22:04.754 --> 22:06.055
CLASSIC SHIRLEY.

22:06.055 --> 22:07.827
SO WE TOLD HER WE'D BRING
HER CAR BACK TODAY.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.460
IN FACT, SHE'S WAITING
FOR US, SO WE SHOULD SCOOT.
 YEAH.

22:10.460 --> 22:13.032
NO WAY.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.605
I'LL DRIVE.
 WHAT?

22:15.605 --> 22:18.408
THE WAY YOU GUYS ARE GOING,
YOU'RE GONNA KILL SOMEONE.

22:18.408 --> 22:20.940
GO, BOB. I'LL MEET YOU BACK
AT THE STATION.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.973
OH, NO, BOB, BOB, DON'T GO!
BOB? OH.

22:26.416 --> 22:27.577
(chuckles nervously)

22:27.577 --> 22:29.419
WELL...
 (seat belt clicks)

22:29.419 --> 22:31.751
OKAY, A ROAD TRIP
IN THIS NEAT OLD CAR

22:31.751 --> 22:34.454
WITH YOUR COP BOYFRIEND. FUN.

22:39.489 --> 22:41.991
SO WHERE DOES SHIRLEY LIVE?

22:41.991 --> 22:43.963

22:43.963 --> 22:46.566
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME?

22:46.566 --> 22:49.669
JUST KEEP DRIVING.
I'LL TELL YOU WHEN TO TURN.

22:52.442 --> 22:54.504
HUH. THAT'S INTERESTING.

22:54.504 --> 22:55.875
NO, IT'S NOT.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.608
I MEAN...
(chuckles) WHAT IS?

22:58.608 --> 23:01.851
OKLAHOMA CITY REDHAWKS.
IS YOUR AUNT A FAN?

23:01.851 --> 23:07.587
OH, YEAH, SHIRLEY LOVES
THAT... UH... SPORT.

23:07.587 --> 23:10.520
AND... MEN'S COLOGNE?

23:10.520 --> 23:12.391
SHE'S A LESBIAN.

23:12.391 --> 23:16.696
YEAH. SHE COULD'VE BEEN MARRIED,
BUT, NO, SHE'S A LESBIAN.

23:19.128 --> 23:21.931
SO, THIS, UM, AUNT
OR... FRIEND,

23:21.931 --> 23:25.134
WHO'S A MEN'S COLOGNE-WEARING
LESBIAN--

23:25.134 --> 23:27.737
SHE ALSO LIKES
TO CHEW TOBACCO?

23:30.540 --> 23:33.613
'CAUSE I NEVER MET A WOMAN
WHO LIKES TO CHEW...

23:33.613 --> 23:35.545
EVER.

23:37.186 --> 23:39.589
I CHEW TOBACCO. (chuckles)

23:39.589 --> 23:41.551
AND I'M A WOMAN.

23:41.551 --> 23:44.654
(sighs) YEAH.

23:44.654 --> 23:46.425
MMM.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.127
MMM.

23:48.127 --> 23:51.661
(mouth full) ALL THAT'S MISSING
IS A GLASS OF CHARDONNAY.

23:53.603 --> 23:55.665
I KEEP TELLING HER TO QUIT.
"DO YOU WANT MOUTH CANCER?"

23:55.665 --> 23:58.538
I SAY, BUT SHE WON'T LISTEN.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.809
(gags)

23:59.809 --> 24:01.511
YOU OKAY?

24:01.511 --> 24:04.173
YEAH. UGH!

24:04.173 --> 24:06.716
NO. PULL OVER. NOW.

24:13.683 --> 24:17.687
SORRY! SHIRLEY LIKES PLAIN.
I PREFER CHOCOLATE.

24:17.687 --> 24:18.688
(retching)
 OH!

24:18.688 --> 24:20.129
OOH.

24:23.032 --> 24:24.063
GET OUT.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.194
(gasps) WHAT?

24:25.194 --> 24:26.195
I'M TAKING YOUR CAR.

24:26.195 --> 24:28.638
OH, MY GOD. I COULD KISS YOU!

24:28.638 --> 24:31.040
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU...
JUST GET OUT!

24:31.040 --> 24:32.772
(whispers) SHH!
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.574
THAT MAN OVER THERE IS A COP.

24:34.574 --> 24:35.975
A COP?

24:35.975 --> 24:37.807
(normal voice)
NO! GET BACK IN HERE.

24:37.807 --> 24:40.850
WHEN YOU START SOMETHING,
YOUNG MAN, YOU SEE IT THROUGH.

24:43.152 --> 24:44.183
BUCKLE UP!

24:47.717 --> 24:50.690
(tires screech)

24:50.690 --> 24:53.663
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

24:55.825 --> 24:58.197
SHIRLEY. JUST HAPPENED
TO BE WALKING BY.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.029
ISN'T THAT A STROKE
OF LUCK?

25:01.831 --> 25:05.535
SO DO YOU THINK YOUR FRIEND BOB
COULD GIVE US A RIDE HOME?

25:05.535 --> 25:09.208
SURE. I'LL--I'LL CALL HIM.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.641
(sighs)

25:11.641 --> 25:14.684
SO HOW'S THAT DATING A COP
WHILE COVERING UP A MURDER

25:14.684 --> 25:16.185
WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

25:25.695 --> 25:28.027
HEY, RENEE. LADIES.

25:28.027 --> 25:31.701
DON'T DISTRACT THEM. THEY HAVE
AN IMPORTANT JOB TO DO.

25:31.701 --> 25:33.202
I'M GONNA GO SEE
THE NEW NEIGHBOR.

25:33.202 --> 25:36.566
YOU KNOW, GIVE HIM A RIDE
ON THE OL' WELCOME WAGON.

25:36.566 --> 25:37.867
WOW, THAT WAS FAST.

25:37.867 --> 25:39.869
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU TWO
HAD EVEN TALKED.
 WE HAVEN'T.

25:39.869 --> 25:42.912
SO WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'S GONNA BE INTERESTED?

25:42.912 --> 25:47.116
(sighs) HEAR THAT, LADIES?
WATCH AND LEARN.

25:47.116 --> 25:50.279
I WILL SHOW YOU SOME
OF MY SECRETS.

25:52.622 --> 25:55.825
(knock on door)

25:55.825 --> 25:57.887
HI. I'M GONNA SAVE US
SOME TIME.

25:57.887 --> 26:00.029
LOOK, I'M SINGLE.
YOU'RE SINGLE.

26:00.029 --> 26:03.332
I'M HOT. YOU'RE HOT.
ASSUMING YOU'RE NOT GAY,

26:03.332 --> 26:05.895
AND THOSE SHOES
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT,

26:05.895 --> 26:08.968
WE COULD DO THAT THING
WHERE WE FLIRT FOR A FEW WEEKS.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.070
YOU CAN STARE AT MY ASS
GETTING THE MAIL,

26:11.070 --> 26:14.904
AND I DO GET MY MAIL
FOUR TIMES A DAY.

26:14.904 --> 26:20.880
ORYOU... COULD INVITE ME IN
FOR... COFFEE...

26:20.880 --> 26:22.351
RIGHT NOW.

26:22.351 --> 26:26.185
THANKS FOR THE OFFER,
BUT, UH, I'M GOOD.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.788
(chuckles) EXCUSE ME.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.890
UM, WHEN I SAID "COFFEE,"

26:30.890 --> 26:34.664
YOU DID KNOW I MEANT SEX,
RIGHT?

26:34.664 --> 26:39.598
OH, YOU WERE SUBTLE,
BUT, UH, YEAH. I GOT IT.

26:46.636 --> 26:48.708
WOW.
YOU SHOULD WRITE A BOOK.

26:48.708 --> 26:52.181
OTHERWISE, WHEN YOU DIE,
YOUR SECRETS WILL DIE WITH YOU.

26:57.246 --> 26:59.889
FATHER DUGAN!

26:59.889 --> 27:01.951
I'M SO GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.

27:01.951 --> 27:03.252
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER ME.

27:03.252 --> 27:06.155
GABRIELLE SOLIS. I ASSUME
YOU'VE COME TO APOLOGIZE

27:06.155 --> 27:08.898
FOR TAKING A PHONE CALL
DURING MY EASTER SERMON?

27:08.898 --> 27:11.230
OH! I'M SORRY, FATHER.
BUT, YOU KNOW,

27:11.230 --> 27:13.663
IF YOU DON'T CONFIRM THOSE
SPA APPOINTMENTS, YOU LOSE 'EM.

27:13.663 --> 27:14.804
YEAH.

27:14.804 --> 27:17.707
UM, ANYWAY, I CAME HERE
ABOUT CARLOS.

27:17.707 --> 27:19.168
HE'S IN TROUBLE,
AND HE NEEDS YOUR HELP.

27:19.168 --> 27:21.010
WELL, I'D LOVE TO HELP CARLOS.
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

27:21.010 --> 27:22.772
BUT I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

27:22.772 --> 27:25.815
WHAT? YOU WERE THE ONE WHO
KEPT BLABBING IN THAT SERMON

27:25.815 --> 27:28.247
HOW IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
TO CONFESS YOUR SINS.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.979
SEE?

27:29.979 --> 27:31.681
I CAN LISTENANDTAKE CALLS.

27:31.681 --> 27:34.423
IT'S TRUE. GOD WAITS
UNTIL THE HEART IS READY.

27:34.423 --> 27:36.085
BUT THE AIRLINES
ARE A LITTLE STRICTER,

27:36.085 --> 27:39.729
AND I'M NOT GOING OVERSEAS
IN A MIDDLE SEAT.

27:39.729 --> 27:41.330
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

27:41.330 --> 27:43.192
YOU GETTING ON, TOO, MISS?

27:43.192 --> 27:46.896
UH, YES, BUT I COULDN'T...
MANAGE MY BAG.

27:46.896 --> 27:49.098
BE A DEAR
AND GRAB IT FOR ME?

27:53.002 --> 27:54.443
HEY.

27:54.443 --> 27:55.945
(door closes)

27:55.945 --> 27:56.946
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:56.946 --> 27:58.748
TAKING YOU
TO THE AIRPORT...

27:58.748 --> 28:00.449
(seat belt clicks)
 WITH ONE QUICK DETOUR.

28:00.449 --> 28:02.451
(engine starts)

28:02.451 --> 28:05.254
HEY! HEY, HEY, HEY!
STOP IT! STOP IT!

28:05.254 --> 28:07.957
ARE YOU CRAZY?
I CAN'T MISS MY PLANE.

28:07.957 --> 28:10.189
WELL, I'M SORRY IF I'M TRYING
TO GET YOU TO DO GOD'S WORK

28:10.189 --> 28:12.862
INSTEAD OF GOING
ON YOUR DREAM VACATION TO...

28:12.862 --> 28:17.096
RWANDA, WHERE I'LL BE
DIGGING WELLS... FOR LEPERS.

28:17.096 --> 28:20.800
WELL, YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS
ARE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.902
(man) EXCUSE ME.
 WHOA.

28:24.233 --> 28:25.975
WELL,
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

28:25.975 --> 28:27.737
WE'RE HEADED OFF
ON OUR HONEYMOON.

28:27.737 --> 28:29.008
AND WE CAN'T HAVE
ANY DETOURS.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.980
THEY SAY YOU HAVE TO GET
TO THE AIRPORT THREE HOURS EARLY

28:30.980 --> 28:32.742
FOR INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS.

28:32.742 --> 28:34.713
OH, HONEY, RELAX.
SINCE WE CAUGHT BIN LADEN,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.916
YOU CAN STROLL ON THE PLANE
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

28:38.988 --> 28:41.490
(sighs) IT'S JUST,
I'VE DONE SOMETHING, FATHER,

28:41.490 --> 28:45.995
AND I'M AFRAID THAT IT'S...
UNFORGIVABLE.

28:45.995 --> 28:47.957
GOD CAN FORGIVE US
FOR ANYTHING.

28:47.957 --> 28:49.198
REALLY? ANYTHING?

28:49.198 --> 28:50.930
YES.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.963
IF WE'RE WILLING TO SHOW
THAT WE ARE TRULY REPENTANT.

28:53.963 --> 28:55.064
HOW?

28:55.064 --> 28:58.107
WELL,
IT'S NOT BY WHAT WE SAY.

28:58.107 --> 28:59.909
IT'S BY WHAT WE DO.

28:59.909 --> 29:05.014
FOR INSTANCE, IF WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT A CRIME...

29:07.076 --> 29:08.918
THEN CONFESSING
TO THE AUTHORITIES

29:08.918 --> 29:11.921
WOULD PROVE THE INTENTIONS
OF OUR HEART.

29:11.921 --> 29:14.253
(exhales deeply)

29:14.253 --> 29:16.986
THAT...

29:16.986 --> 29:18.327
IS NOT AN OPTION.

29:20.359 --> 29:24.033
THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE
INVOLVED--INNOCENT PEOPLE.

29:24.033 --> 29:25.534
YOU CAN'T ASK TO BE ABSOLVED

29:25.534 --> 29:27.997
FOR A SIN THAT YOU INTEND
TO KEEP HIDDEN.

29:32.942 --> 29:35.074
YOU SHOULD GO.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.006
YOU'RE GONNA MISS
YOUR FLIGHT.

29:37.006 --> 29:38.978
I DON'T WANNA LEAVE YOU,
CARLOS,

29:38.978 --> 29:42.381
NOT TILL I'M SURE
THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

29:42.381 --> 29:46.515
FATHER DUGAN,
I DON'T SEE ANY WAY

29:46.515 --> 29:49.188
THAT I AM EVER
GOING TO BE OKAY.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.504
HEY.

30:05.504 --> 30:08.878
HEY. (sighs)

30:17.316 --> 30:21.590
(sighs) I WISH I COULD MAKE YOU
STOP THINKING ABOUT THIS.

30:25.154 --> 30:26.856
YEAH, ME, TOO.

30:30.199 --> 30:32.231
(sighs)

30:32.231 --> 30:34.563
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

30:39.068 --> 30:41.210
THERE IS NO ABSOLUTION
FOR THIS THING.

30:44.273 --> 30:46.045
I JUST HAVE TO LIVE
WITH IT.

31:01.090 --> 31:03.893
EVERY NOISE I'D HEAR AT NIGHT,
IT WAS HIM.

31:06.195 --> 31:09.368
EVERY DARK ALLEY I PASSED,
HE WAS WAITING FOR ME.

31:11.140 --> 31:13.242
WHEN I'D LIE IN BED,

31:13.242 --> 31:16.275
I WAS AFRAID
HE'D COME FIND ME.

31:18.908 --> 31:22.211
HE WAS IN MY DREAMS...
AND IN MY NIGHTMARES.

31:22.211 --> 31:24.183
I COULDN'T ESCAPE HIM.

31:31.660 --> 31:34.063
AND THAT'S WHAT I HAD
TO LIVE WITH...

31:35.524 --> 31:37.096
UNTIL NOW.

31:43.502 --> 31:46.535
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I'M NOT SCARED.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.980
(whispers)
 YOUDID THAT FOR ME.

31:53.442 --> 31:55.384
YEAH...

31:55.384 --> 31:57.616
BY TAKING A MAN'S LIFE.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.994
YES, YOU MAY HAVE TAKEN A LIFE,
BUT YOU ALSO SAVED ONE.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.530
SO IF IT'S ABSOLUTION
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR...

32:13.332 --> 32:15.234
IGIVE IT TO YOU.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.292
(gasps)

32:43.292 --> 32:47.196
(panting)

32:57.106 --> 33:00.109
(rapping on door)

33:00.109 --> 33:01.150
HEY.
 HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

33:01.150 --> 33:02.981
HEY, IS EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH THE KIDS?

33:02.981 --> 33:05.984
YEAH, YEAH, THE--
THE KIDS ARE FINE. I JUST--

33:05.984 --> 33:07.286
WHAT? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

33:07.286 --> 33:10.189
(voice breaking) I REALLY...
NEED YOU RIGHT NOW.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.622
OKAY.

33:13.622 --> 33:16.625
(breathing heavily)

33:42.091 --> 33:44.293
MORNING.

33:44.293 --> 33:47.126
MORNING.

33:47.126 --> 33:48.697
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

33:48.697 --> 33:50.329
CRAP, CRAP, CRAP.

33:52.161 --> 33:54.533
AH.
 AAH!

33:54.533 --> 33:56.205

33:56.205 --> 33:57.506
WATCH OUT FOR THE, UH--

33:57.506 --> 33:59.368
OHH! UGH! UGH!

33:59.368 --> 34:01.270
HONEY. OOH.
 NO, I'M OKAY. OKAY, GO.

34:01.270 --> 34:04.643
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.315
(sighs)

34:06.315 --> 34:08.377
THEY'RE STILL ASLEEP.

34:08.377 --> 34:09.447
THANK GOD.

34:11.820 --> 34:13.252
(laughs)

34:13.252 --> 34:14.652
(whispers)
I'LL START THE COFFEE.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.525
OKAY, YOU READ MY MIND.

34:18.527 --> 34:19.527
(sighs)

34:19.527 --> 34:21.360
HEY.
 YEAH?

34:21.360 --> 34:23.161
SO LAST NIGHT...

34:23.161 --> 34:25.594
(sighs) YEAH.

34:25.594 --> 34:27.735
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT.

34:27.735 --> 34:31.340
UH-HUH.

34:31.340 --> 34:35.143
I MEAN...

34:35.143 --> 34:38.206
IF YOU WANNA
GET BACK TOGETHER...

34:38.206 --> 34:39.447
I'M OPEN TO THAT.

34:39.447 --> 34:43.312
BUT WE HAVE
SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS

34:43.312 --> 34:47.356
THAT ARE GONNA REQUIRE
SERIOUS WORK.

34:47.356 --> 34:50.159
OH, GOD.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.292
LAST NIGHT...

34:54.422 --> 34:55.864
UH...

34:57.496 --> 34:59.198
WAS...

34:59.198 --> 35:01.370
NOT ABOUT GETTING
BACK TOGETHER.

35:03.372 --> 35:06.175
(sighs) THEN WHAT THE HELL
WAS IT ABOUT?

35:06.175 --> 35:10.279
I...

35:10.279 --> 35:12.110
I HAD A NIGHTMARE.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.744
WELL... A-ANIGHTMARE?
 ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

35:15.744 --> 35:17.216
YOU'VE GOTTA UNDERSTAND.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.788
I'M HAVING A LOT
OF NIGHTMARES.

35:19.788 --> 35:23.722
THIS IS SUCH A SCARY TIME,
AND I REALLY NEED YOU.

35:23.722 --> 35:26.355
THAT'S--THAT'S WHY
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL THE KIDS.

35:26.355 --> 35:30.199
HAVING YOU ACROSS THE STREET
MAKES ME FEEL SAFE.

35:30.199 --> 35:32.401
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

35:32.401 --> 35:35.734
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU'RE SCARED, LYNETTE?

35:35.734 --> 35:37.306
YOU BUY A NIGHT-LIGHT.

35:37.306 --> 35:39.368
YOU DON'T GO HAVE SEX
WITH THE GUY

35:39.368 --> 35:43.412
YOU ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE SEPARATED FROM!

35:43.412 --> 35:46.144
(rapid footsteps descend stairs)

35:46.144 --> 35:47.876
I WANT FRENCH TOAST.

35:47.876 --> 35:49.748
I HATE FRENCH TOAST.
I WANT PANCAKES.
 OH.

35:59.288 --> 36:00.759
KIDS...

36:07.436 --> 36:10.239
THERE'S SOMETHING YOUR MOM AND I
NEED TO TELL YOU.

36:13.402 --> 36:15.574
YEAH.

36:18.247 --> 36:20.349
WHY DON'T WE SIT DOWN?

36:25.654 --> 36:28.357
(sighs) HEY, I, UH,
I KNOW IT'S A BARBECUE,

36:28.357 --> 36:31.360
BUT ISN'T THAT
A LITTLE CASUAL?

36:32.861 --> 36:34.363
YEAH, UM,

36:34.363 --> 36:36.925
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA GO
THIS YEAR.

36:36.925 --> 36:38.427
WHY DON'T YOU GO
WITHOUT ME?

36:44.233 --> 36:46.435
HEY, DO I NEED
TO BE WORRIED?

36:46.435 --> 36:50.279
I TOLD YOU. I'M FINE.

36:50.279 --> 36:51.910
I DON'T MEAN WORRIED
ABOUTYOU.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.812
I MEAN WORRIED ABOUTUS.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.547
I THOUGHT THIS WAS SOME PROBLEM
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS,

36:58.547 --> 37:02.621
BUT... THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN
SHUTTING ME OUT,

37:02.621 --> 37:05.324
I'M STARTING TO THINK
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH ME.

37:05.324 --> 37:07.896
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

37:07.896 --> 37:10.299
(sighs)

37:10.299 --> 37:13.432
NO MATTER WHAT
I'M GOING THROUGH,

37:13.432 --> 37:16.735
I WOULD NEVER LET ANYTHING
COME BETWEEN US.

37:18.307 --> 37:21.970
YEAH, I'M SURE TOM AND LYNETTE
FELT THE SAME WAY.

37:21.970 --> 37:24.313
LOOK WHERE THEY ENDED UP.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.584
WELL, I'M HEADED OVER THERE
WITHOUT YOU.

37:35.584 --> 37:39.788
NO. I'M GOING WITH YOU.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.462
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.764
I DO HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THE GIRLS.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.036
IT'S ABOUT TIME I WENT OVER
THERE AND STRAIGHTENED IT OUT.

37:50.999 --> 37:54.403
NO! NO WAY. YOU ARE NOT
BRINGING MIKE IN ON THIS.

37:54.403 --> 37:57.476
HE'S NOT GONNA TELL ANYONE.
WE CAN TRUST HIM.

37:57.476 --> 37:58.407
OH, JUST LIKE I COULD TRUST YOU

37:58.407 --> 38:00.309
WHEN WE AGREED
TO KEEP THIS BETWEEN US?

38:00.309 --> 38:02.451
SUSAN, WE ALL EMPATHIZE
WITH YOUR POSITION,

38:02.451 --> 38:04.613
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S SMART TO TELL MIKE.

38:04.613 --> 38:06.455
WELL, HE KNOWS SOMETHING IS UP.

38:06.455 --> 38:08.387
IT'S AFFECTING OUR MARRIAGE.

38:08.387 --> 38:09.458
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA
AFFECT MY MARRIAGE?

38:09.458 --> 38:11.019
WHEN MY HUSBAND GOES TO PRISON.

38:11.019 --> 38:13.392
I THINK WE SHOULD
LET HER TELL HIM.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.724
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

38:15.724 --> 38:17.025
WE ALL MADE A PACT
THAT NIGHT.

38:17.025 --> 38:18.327
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYBODY
BRINGING UP

38:18.327 --> 38:20.068
THESE EXTRA CONDITIONS.

38:20.068 --> 38:21.800
WELL, YOU WEREN'T EXACTLY ASKING
ANYONE'S OPINION THAT NIGHT,

38:21.800 --> 38:22.931
WERE YOU, BREE?

38:22.931 --> 38:24.573
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

38:24.573 --> 38:26.505
IT MEANS YOU ELECTED YOURSELF
CHAIRMAN

38:26.505 --> 38:28.036
OF THE... DEAD GUY COMMITTEE

38:28.036 --> 38:30.308
AND STARTED MAKING DECISIONS
FOR EVERYONE.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.480
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.641
WELL, SOMEBODY HAD TO, SUSAN,

38:32.641 --> 38:34.383
AND IT SURE AS HELL
WASN'T GONNA BEYOU.

38:35.844 --> 38:37.045
I'M DONE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

38:37.045 --> 38:38.587
THE ONLY REASON I CAME
TO THIS BARBECUE

38:38.587 --> 38:41.450
WAS TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT I AM TELLING MIKE.

38:41.450 --> 38:43.452
THE HELL YOU ARE.

38:43.452 --> 38:44.753
AAH!

38:44.753 --> 38:46.425
OH, MY GOD!

38:46.425 --> 38:48.597
(Lynette) GABY! GABY!

38:48.597 --> 38:50.999
TRADE MANNING?
 WHAT, ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

38:50.999 --> 38:53.732
THINK FOR A MINUTE. WHEN IS
HIS STOCK EVER GONNA BE HIGHER?

38:53.732 --> 38:55.063
LET ME GO!

38:55.063 --> 38:56.435
(shouting indistinctly)

38:56.435 --> 38:58.407
YOU COULD GET
A GREAT PLAYER.

38:58.407 --> 39:02.511
YEAH, MAYBE A GREAT QUARTERBACK,
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW. MANNING?

39:02.511 --> 39:05.374
(all laugh)

39:05.374 --> 39:06.475
OW!
 GET OFF ME!

39:06.475 --> 39:08.417
GIRLS,
PEOPLE CAN HEAR US!

39:08.417 --> 39:10.579
OW! I TOLD YOU
WE COULDN'T TRUST HER!

39:10.579 --> 39:11.750
I CAN'T SEE.

39:11.750 --> 39:12.981
LYNETTE! AAH!

39:12.981 --> 39:14.423
OH!
 I GOT IT!

39:14.423 --> 39:15.984
(all scream)

39:17.586 --> 39:20.088
(Mike)
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

39:21.560 --> 39:23.662
UH, WELL...

39:23.662 --> 39:27.365
I... LOST MY EARRING,
AND THE GIRLS HERE WERE

39:27.365 --> 39:28.597
KIND ENOUGH TO HELP ME
LOOK FOR IT.

39:28.597 --> 39:30.599
(all chuckle nervously)

39:30.599 --> 39:33.672
OH! THERE IT IS!

39:33.672 --> 39:36.405
OH!

39:47.015 --> 39:49.157
I WENT
FOOD SHOPPING YESTERDAY.

39:49.157 --> 39:52.521
I KEPT HAVING
TO PUT THINGS BACK.

39:52.521 --> 39:56.094
I'D TAKE A COUPLE OF CANS
OF PEACHES.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.165
(sighs)

39:57.165 --> 39:58.767
(voice breaking)
AND THEN I'D REMEMBER THAT TOM

39:58.767 --> 40:02.601
WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO LIKED THEM,
PUT THEM BACK.

40:02.601 --> 40:06.174
SWEET PICKLES--TOM.

40:06.174 --> 40:08.837
PUT THEM BACK.

40:08.837 --> 40:11.139
I AM SO SORRY.

40:11.139 --> 40:12.781
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON,

40:12.781 --> 40:14.112
I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE
FOR YOU.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.645
(sniffles)

40:16.645 --> 40:17.846
(sighs)

40:17.846 --> 40:20.689
I GUESS WE'VE ALL
BEEN GUILTY OF THAT.

40:24.152 --> 40:26.124
I'M SORRY, SUSAN.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.199
THIS IS SO DAMN HARD.

40:32.661 --> 40:34.733
YOU KNOW, THE GOOD THING

40:34.733 --> 40:39.508
ABOUT MIKE AND TOM NOT KNOWING
IS THEY CAN'T BE IMPLICATED.

40:41.109 --> 40:44.112
IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN,

40:44.112 --> 40:46.144
AT LEAST THEY'D BE OKAY.

40:53.952 --> 41:00.058
WE ARE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO
TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS, ARE WE?

41:01.630 --> 41:03.161
NO.

41:05.594 --> 41:08.937
ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE
TO LIVE WITH THAT?

41:08.937 --> 41:11.069
(exhales deeply)

41:16.675 --> 41:19.247
I'M GONNA TRY.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.119
IT'S ONLY THE BEST OF FRIENDS

41:31.119 --> 41:33.522
WHO STAY LONG AFTER
THE PARTY'S OVER

41:33.522 --> 41:35.924
TO HELP CLEAN UP...

41:38.597 --> 41:43.572
TO CLEANSE THE PAIN
OF A GUILTY CONSCIENCE...

41:43.572 --> 41:46.735
TO PICK UP THE PIECES...

41:46.735 --> 41:50.539
OF A BROKEN MARRIAGE...

41:50.539 --> 41:56.885
TO SWEEP AWAY THE LONELINESS
OF KEEPING A SECRET.

41:56.885 --> 41:58.286
YES...

41:58.286 --> 42:02.250
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE FRIENDS
WHO HELP CLEAN UP OUR MESSES.

42:04.653 --> 42:07.125
BUT EVERY HOUSEWIFE KNOWS

42:07.125 --> 42:10.258
THAT AS SOON AS ONE MESS
IS TAKEN CARE OF...

42:10.258 --> 42:13.061
ANOTHER ONE APPEARS.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.567
AND WE MAY FIND OURSELVES...

42:18.567 --> 42:22.811
RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED.
