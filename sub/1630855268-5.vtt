WEBVTT

00:09.592 --> 00:14.347
Tom Welling, Brandon Routh,
Henry Cavill, Tyler Hoechlin.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.892
Okay, now from best to worst.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.603
Christopher Reeve, Tom Welling...

00:20.603 --> 00:22.355
I'm back. Sorry for the delay.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.273
<i>Where were we?</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:24.858
I don't wanna do more magazine quizzes.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.068
<i>Come on, just a few more questions.</i>

00:28.445 --> 00:30.405
Why are you so determined
on distracting me?

00:30.405 --> 00:34.784
Well, there's a small issue
with the Great Dane.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.204
Exactly how bad is your heart condition?

00:39.080 --> 00:41.750
Emma and I, we gotta track down the MNR.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.002
Aldon, Roo, you find the Dane,

00:44.002 --> 00:46.629
fly him back to prison,
and swap him out for Barry.

00:46.629 --> 00:49.591
Only 45 minutes to head count.
We gotta steal a car and hit it.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.474
<i>Officer Brunner?</i>

00:57.474 --> 00:58.391
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:58.933 --> 01:02.353
DOD rushed satellite tracking
of the reactor's nuclear signature.

01:02.353 --> 01:04.647
It pinged 12 miles east of your location.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.025
- Sending coordinates now.
- Copy that.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.526
Here's the search perimeter.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.738
He doesn't have an ID,
so he won't go to the airport.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.158
Seaport's a no-go.
He'd need money to buy a stowaway slot.

01:15.158 --> 01:18.870
There's no chance we're finding
that toe-blasting bastard by sunrise.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.580
Just call in the NIS already.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.998
You really wanna flag the Greek government

01:21.998 --> 01:23.750
that we smuggled
a nuclear reactor onto their soil?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.376
You're just scared of your ex.

01:25.376 --> 01:29.422
She sang me the entire
<i>Mamma Mia!</i> soundtrack on my voicemail.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.007
I'll play it. It's 57 minutes.

01:31.007 --> 01:34.094
I love crazy women.
Can you give her my number?

01:34.094 --> 01:36.179
Good call on the seaport.
I get motion sickness.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.097
Whoa!

01:37.972 --> 01:38.807
It's just a teddy.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.726
We thought you were cool, Dane.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.479
I am cool. It's just I knew
I was going back to prison again.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.064
No way you'd leave Barry in danger<i>,</i>

01:46.064 --> 01:49.317
and I'd already set up the meet,
so you guys would figure it out, so I ran.

01:50.193 --> 01:53.321
Then it hit me,
what kind of life is that for my family?

01:53.321 --> 01:57.075
To be a fugitive
from NIS and Interpol and CIA?

01:57.075 --> 02:00.912
Better to go back and finish my sentence
than curse my son with a life on the lam.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.705
I can get anything I want in prison.

02:02.705 --> 02:04.541
Oddly enough, the only thing I can't get

02:04.541 --> 02:07.877
is a teddy bear that doesn't have
a glory hole cut out the bottom.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.298
Maybe you could just give that to my son.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.384
Be happy to.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.387
My empathy for you died with my toe.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.973
Now come on,
you're going back to Turkey, turkey.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.307
I read this thing about a doctor

02:21.307 --> 02:23.935
that regrew a guy's penis
on the guy's arm.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.271
- Maybe you could grow your--
- I'm gonna kill him.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.274
<i>Good news, they found the Dane.</i>

02:29.274 --> 02:30.316
<i>They're on their way.</i>

02:33.903 --> 02:37.532
They better hurry
'cause inspection just started.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.623
There it is, end of the street.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.083
Tina, what's the intel?

02:47.083 --> 02:48.960
Address has SARs on everything,

02:48.960 --> 02:51.671
from stolen cars to stolen guns
to stolen people.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.298
<i>It is bad mama-jama territory.</i>

02:53.298 --> 02:55.216
- Be careful.
<i>-</i> <i>Backup's on the way.</i>

02:55.216 --> 02:56.843
Just gotta steal a car first.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.344
Boro's meeting in 30.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.430
- We gotta go in there now.
<i>-</i> <i>Copy.</i>

03:00.430 --> 03:02.098
Emma, be safe.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.474
I'm good.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.518
Sure seem concerned
about my daughter's safety.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.519
What?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.938
Comms. Static.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.399
Everyone is gonna be strapped inside.
I'm point.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.401
Your AOR is behind and right,

03:13.401 --> 03:15.153
and mine is ahead and left.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.237
But watch your six.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.114
Remember that time
we sang "Teddy Bear Picnic"

03:18.114 --> 03:19.616
at the father-daughter talent show?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.534
- Yeah.
- That was harder than this'll be.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.288
Let's fuck 'em up, Dad.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.420
Maybe it's a computer.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.173
Or part of a rocket or something.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.346

04:58.256 --> 04:59.590
So is this.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.970
Aldon, we got the package.
Coming to pick you up for the meet.

05:04.554 --> 05:08.975
I don't think the idea's gonna fly
of Aldon posing as Dane's personal valet.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.768
I mean, I know Boro well enough

05:10.768 --> 05:14.814
that if he doesn't see a dude showing up
that looks like Zach Galifianakis,

05:14.814 --> 05:16.316
he's gonna drive right by.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.233
We gotta prove to him

05:17.233 --> 05:18.985
- that the Great Dane is there.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.322
Hey.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.249
You kinda look like someone I know.

05:35.585 --> 05:36.627
All right.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.506
Hurry up
because if anything happens to Barry,

05:40.506 --> 05:43.509
I will get you transferred
to an even worse Turkish prison.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.678
The one with no windows
that only gets Showtime.

05:45.678 --> 05:46.763
Understood.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.516
But first... I want you to have this.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.643
I got it at the sundry store
where I found the teddy.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.438
It goes on your piggies
and strengthens the toes you have left.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.649
Wow, I don't even know what to say.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.152
It's fine.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.446
Are you shitting me?

06:03.446 --> 06:06.532
You think you can win me back
with an impulse CVS buy?

06:06.532 --> 06:07.784
Get in the vent.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.828
I'm gonna hesitate
next time I think of buying you a gift.

06:10.828 --> 06:11.996
Get in the vent.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.468
<i>Keep it together.</i>

06:28.596 --> 06:30.181
Mr. Polonia.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.975
- Right on schedule.
<i>-</i> Who the hell are you?

06:32.975 --> 06:34.602
Emissary of our friend, the Dane.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.479
His test results are pending,

06:36.479 --> 06:39.065
so he's keeping his distance
for your safety and his.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.943
If he got his most elite client sick,
he'd be ruined.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.361
Never seen the Dane so tan.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.113
Greek beaches, am I right?

06:46.364 --> 06:48.825
Great Dane, my friend,

06:48.825 --> 06:50.535
when you're feeling better,

06:50.535 --> 06:53.579
how about we party again
like old times, eh?

06:55.665 --> 06:56.916
Fire some...

06:57.542 --> 06:58.626
finger guns.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.257
Those are jazz hands!

07:04.882 --> 07:06.342
Finger guns!

07:11.556 --> 07:14.183
That's my Dane. You madman.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.201
What's wrong with him?

07:34.954 --> 07:37.999
Your father-in-law's stupid crack wax
isn't holding his wound shut.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.083
He's bleeding.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.043
Don't open the box!

07:46.466 --> 07:47.925
Dad.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.101
Aldon, we're on our way.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.147
I got it handled. Get Boro.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.068
Shit, he's all over the place.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.370
Let's see what you got, big'un.

08:23.961 --> 08:24.795
Tina,

08:25.296 --> 08:26.589
I want you to know...

08:30.134 --> 08:32.678
- You're not the Great Dane.
- I know, right?

08:36.140 --> 08:37.808
Why won't you go down?

08:47.777 --> 08:49.904
-  Oh no!

08:49.904 --> 08:53.157
No. Oh God. Dick on my face.

08:55.952 --> 08:56.827

09:06.671 --> 09:07.505

09:15.179 --> 09:16.847
- Called it.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.435
Shoot him in the calf.
We got to find out who his buyers are.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.992
-  See?

09:35.992 --> 09:37.743
Just like the girl from the prom.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.204
Boro passed out on animal tranqs,

09:40.204 --> 09:44.333
Jenny Pepperman drank two Michelob Lights
and rode her bike into Willow Pond.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.459
Exactly.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.177
- White Lotus!

10:07.732 --> 10:09.775
Don't molest the dead. It's gross.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.902
- I didn't mean to.
- Relax.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.739
It's not like anyone's gonna miss
Old Cavity-Search Constantine.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.699
Hurry up and get that body up here.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.160
I'll hide it behind the vent
near Cyrus the Cannibal's cell.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.996
We are gonna have to take a couple bites
out of him just to sell it.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.124
I'm joking.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.503
But we will have to fit that large man
through this small hole.

10:31.839 --> 10:32.673
<i>Tina...</i>

10:34.759 --> 10:36.677
I haven't been completely honest with you.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.306
When I said I wanted to impress you
because you were new on the team,

10:41.015 --> 10:42.141
that was a lie.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.144
I wanted to impress you because I...

10:46.270 --> 10:47.104
like you.

10:47.772 --> 10:51.108
And the problem is,
I'm not the most impressive guy.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.110
I'm a mediocre oboist

10:53.110 --> 10:55.905
who's auditioned for <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>
four times and never been picked.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.115
Despite that, I was wondering

10:58.115 --> 11:00.576
if maybe when we get back,

11:02.495 --> 11:03.913
you wanna go on a date with me.

11:05.581 --> 11:08.209
<i>I... thought you'd never ask.</i>

11:09.418 --> 11:12.838
<i>I'll see you when you get back.
And Barry, Pat Sajak's a dick.</i>

11:18.302 --> 11:20.137
I know you were really scared today.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.139
I wanted to be brave, but, you know,

11:23.140 --> 11:24.183
Turkish prison.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.103
You don't understand what I'm saying.
And who is braver?

11:27.103 --> 11:29.897
The guy that does something
that he's not scared of,

11:29.897 --> 11:32.191
or the guy that is scared of something
and does it anyway?

11:32.817 --> 11:34.485
You were badass today.

11:36.445 --> 11:37.655
I'm proud of you.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.785
Thanks, Luke.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.708
What's that smell?

11:50.835 --> 11:53.129
White Lotus by Elizabeth DuVray.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.548
- It ruins the moment.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.764
- How's the prisoner?
- Roo just showed him her toe.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.891
Pretty sure that violates
the Geneva Convention.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.063
- That ape banged you up pretty good.
- No, no, no.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.732
It's just a strained rotator cuff.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.151
Used to happen all the time
when I played ball.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.111
Just gotta tough it out.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.157
You should put some ice on it.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.285
- Now.
<i>-</i> Yes, sir.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.704

12:46.640 --> 12:49.143

12:49.143 --> 12:51.812
Rachel Dunlop
with her stupid magician father?

12:51.812 --> 12:54.398
- Such bullshit.
- Your mother was really mad.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.443
Her getting up and booing
when they got the trophy.

13:00.362 --> 13:04.992
You asked before if I would have taken
a desk job... to keep your mother.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.161
I should have taken a desk job.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.955
I should have scrubbed toilets.
I should have dug ditches.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.918
I should have done anything...
to hold on to your mother.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.506
Would you do the same for Carter?

13:19.340 --> 13:20.341
I won't have to.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.969
I'm not gonna make the same mistake
as you and Mom.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.596
I don't wanna hurt him.

13:25.596 --> 13:29.225
Remember when you were little
and you gave Oscar a piggyback,

13:29.225 --> 13:32.561
and he fell
and started crying and screaming,

13:32.561 --> 13:36.607
and the doctor asked me to hold him down
while he's putting the stitches in him?

13:38.400 --> 13:39.443
I couldn't do it.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.904
I couldn't stand the idea of hurting him,

13:41.904 --> 13:45.825
so I sat in the car
while your mother did it.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.536
Oscar called her "Mean Mama" for a week.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.371
Pain is part of love.

13:50.371 --> 13:54.500
Barry went to prison for Tina,
and he just likes her.

13:54.500 --> 13:59.380
And the Dane went back to prison
because he loves his son.

14:00.130 --> 14:03.509
It broke my heart
when your mom and I got divorced.

14:04.093 --> 14:08.347
She didn't wanna divorce you.
She just wanted a present husband.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.807
And I couldn't be that.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.434
So...

14:14.353 --> 14:15.729
I let the marriage go.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.399
For her.

14:19.149 --> 14:22.945
And if you love Carter,
you would do exactly the same thing.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.656
The longer you drag it on,
the more you're gonna hurt him.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.908
It's just my opinion.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.369
But I know...

14:35.291 --> 14:36.542
it is your decision.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.856
- Oh.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.568
- Is Boro talking yet?
<i>-</i> <i>No.</i>

15:02.568 --> 15:05.321
But right now I'm more concerned
with why my top operative

15:05.321 --> 15:08.073
thought it was a good idea
to hire his ex at his cover job.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.451
- You know?
<i>-</i> <i>I'm a regional CIA director.</i>

15:10.451 --> 15:13.329
I know your milk's gone bad before you do.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.624
I also know Tally's been poking around
Merry Fitness' paperwork.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.208
<i>Tally was trying to get a job,</i>

15:18.208 --> 15:20.127
and I'm trying to win her back.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.172
So, um, I know it was not a smart idea.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.465
No, it wasn't.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.092
But we may be in the clear.
Seems she's stopped digging.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.725
I'm not so sure about that.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.226
We have to talk.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.279
Before you say anything,
let me explain to you--

15:47.279 --> 15:49.031
It's Romi.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.451
She's sick.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.504
I don't know, some kind of
adverse reaction to the chemo.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.673
<i>She's gonna need bone marrow
sooner than we thought.</i>

16:05.673 --> 16:07.049
I hate that I wasn't a match.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.760
- How's your donor drive idea?
<i>-</i> <i>I talked to the superintendent.</i>

16:09.760 --> 16:11.428
He hasn't gotten back to me yet.

16:11.428 --> 16:15.432
Um, I do know that they tend to worry
about liability issues with these things.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.892
A child is dying.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.061
I know. I told him it was for my niece.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.480
<i>I begged him.
Said he had to talk to the lawyers.</i>

16:23.023 --> 16:25.442
Look, if your school district
got behind this,

16:25.442 --> 16:27.653
we could reach 10,000 people in a day.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.030
I swear to you, I am doing the best I can.

16:30.906 --> 16:33.242
Okay, look, I gotta take another call.
Just get it done.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.368
<i>I will do my best.</i>

16:34.368 --> 16:35.911
- I... I love you--

16:36.412 --> 16:37.621
H-- Hello?

16:48.215 --> 16:49.258
Hi, Kyle.

16:51.093 --> 16:51.927
I'm Samantha.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.596
- Wh... What the hell is this?
- Hi, Kyle.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.435
Oh, I get it.

16:59.977 --> 17:04.356
You're her old man,
but you can't raise the kickstand anymore,

17:04.356 --> 17:06.358
so now you just like to watch?

17:06.358 --> 17:08.027
We're here about Sandy Yoon.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.195
The woman you knocked up and ghosted.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.781
Okay, in my defense, the condom broke.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.783
It's not my fault the chick kept the kid.

17:14.783 --> 17:15.868
She's not some chick.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.829
She's my daughter-in-law
and the mother of my grandchild.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.998
Her name is Romi, and she has leukemia.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.333
She needs bone marrow.
You might be a match.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.796
Hey, even if she's not lying
and I was this kid's dad--

17:27.796 --> 17:29.214
No, my son is her dad.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.467
He's been Romi's father
since he met Sandy,

17:31.467 --> 17:33.010
eight months pregnant and alone,

17:33.010 --> 17:35.929
crying in the romance section
of a bookstore, thanks to you.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.139
You're just a sperm donor.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.975
Now you're gonna be responsible
for the first time in your life,

17:39.975 --> 17:41.393
and you're gonna help my granddaughter.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.436
And my niece.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.647
And my grandniece.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.068
Thanks, Kyle.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.070
I'll get this to the lab.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.784
We're gonna let you know
if you're a match.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.042
Before we begin,

18:05.042 --> 18:07.920
I've just been informed, unfortunately,

18:07.920 --> 18:10.506
no one in this regional branch
is a match for Romi.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.800
But I've personally reached out
across the agency.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.301
We're getting more swabs as we speak.

18:14.301 --> 18:17.262
Thank you very much, Director.
I appreciate your support.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.265
Now, let's focus on Boro.

18:22.726 --> 18:25.312
Boo!

18:25.312 --> 18:27.648
That guy sucks.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.233
As an enemy combatant,

18:29.233 --> 18:32.653
Mr. Polonia has no rights
under the Geneva Convention.

18:32.653 --> 18:36.949
Technically, since he's in transit,
we could hold him indefinitely.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.576
Boro has ties
with multiple terrorist groups

18:39.576 --> 18:41.161
interested in purchasing his weapons,

18:41.161 --> 18:44.289
from the Middle East, to the Far East,
to right here at home.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.542
He's sitting on a trove of intel,

18:46.542 --> 18:49.336
and we need to do
whatever it takes to mine it.

18:49.336 --> 18:52.381
As such,
I've submitted a request to the DOJ

18:52.381 --> 18:55.092
to employ enhanced
interrogation techniques.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.135
We're awaiting a PDD.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.303
- You down with PDD?
- Yeah, you know me.

18:58.303 --> 19:02.057
Presidential Decision Directive
for authorization for torture?

19:02.057 --> 19:04.393
That's a line that government
should never cross.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.771
Is that why you're against it,
or is it 'cause it'd be used against Boro?

19:07.771 --> 19:08.856
What does that mean?

19:08.856 --> 19:13.485
I'm just saying, you paid for his school,
you looked after him from afar...

19:13.485 --> 19:16.029
I mean... you have a soft spot.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.614
That's ridiculous.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.159
He was a kid that needed help.
That's it and that's all.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.287
He was, and now he's a dangerous man
with dangerous friends.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.122
I say we turn the screws on him.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.291
It's always easy to support torture

19:27.291 --> 19:29.793
when you haven't seen it
from five feet away like I have.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.296
I agree with your dad, Emma.
There are parameters.

19:32.296 --> 19:36.175
In the canon of most superheroes,
they only torture as a last resort.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.011
Oh, ixnay on the nerd itshay.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.304
I agree with Luke.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.598
I think there are better ways
to get info out of someone.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.474
You gonna honeypot Boro?

19:44.474 --> 19:48.645
I'm just saying,
you don't run headfirst into torture.

19:48.645 --> 19:49.897
It's a big step.

19:49.897 --> 19:53.567
I spent months on this guy's compound.
I know him better than anyone here.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.195
Boro only understands violence.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.571
So let's give it to him.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.032
It physically pains me to say this,

20:00.032 --> 20:01.658
but Princess Emma's right.

20:01.658 --> 20:05.913
This dickbag tried to kill
almost everyone in this room.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.665
How are Covergirl and I
the only one with balls in here?

20:08.665 --> 20:10.709
Well, the point is moot
till we get that PDD.

20:10.709 --> 20:14.171
In the meantime,
I'm putting Carlson on standby.

20:14.755 --> 20:18.008
Carlson? Ooh, that guy be creepy.

20:19.927 --> 20:23.347
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
You didn't corral your cart.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.974
- Carts go in the cart corral.
- What?

20:25.974 --> 20:28.894
Your cart rolled off
and it dinged my PT Cruiser.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.479
Piss off.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.232
Boy, that just creams my corn.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.447
Yello. Norm Carlson here.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.659
Outstanding.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.079
Yeah, I just re-upped on supplies too.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.050
Look at this.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.176
A reunion.

21:01.176 --> 21:04.179
Me, Finn, Danielle,

21:04.763 --> 21:06.014
whatever your real names are.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.225
I invited you into my home,

21:08.850 --> 21:10.811
clothed you, fed you.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.565
And you, Finn, I never once lied to you,

21:17.234 --> 21:18.652
not even when I said I loved you.

21:19.319 --> 21:20.612
I looked up to you,

21:20.612 --> 21:22.781
and you kill my only living parent.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.450
Now you chain me up.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.204
Tell me, who's the bad guy?

21:29.204 --> 21:31.957
The one selling nukes to terrorists?

21:33.375 --> 21:35.877
- Now listen to me, Bengal--
- Don't "Bengal" me.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.754
Let me ask you something.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.506
Did you ever care for me at all?

21:39.506 --> 21:42.259
Or were you just acting
to curry favor with my father?

21:42.259 --> 21:43.760
And once you killed him,

21:44.678 --> 21:48.432
you took care of things for me
out of guilt to assuage your conscience.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.601
I cared for you then,
and I care for you now.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.395
That's why I'm trying to tell you

21:53.395 --> 21:56.481
that there's a man coming
to inflict tremendous pain on you.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.567
Pain unimaginable,

21:58.567 --> 22:02.696
using methods that slide through
the tiniest loopholes in our legal system.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.656
I'm fighting to stop that.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.992
And I'm cheering for it
like it's homecoming.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.994
I don't care if a Ginsu knife salesman

22:08.994 --> 22:12.372
shoves his entire sample case
up your ass to get you to talk.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.833
Danielle, bring it down a notch, okay?

22:14.833 --> 22:16.501
Listen to the man, Dani.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.253
I am a shark.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.549
You caught a shark. Good for you.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.677
But play my way,

22:26.595 --> 22:28.889
and I can catch you many blue whales

22:28.889 --> 22:31.975
who all wanna get their fins
on my suitcase bomb.

22:31.975 --> 22:33.352
The auction is in stasis.

22:33.352 --> 22:37.314
One signal from me,
I could lead them all right to you.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.775
What are the conditions?

22:39.775 --> 22:41.360
Captivity on my terms.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.070
House arrest in Bora Bora,

22:43.945 --> 22:45.781
assets remain untouched.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.408
A waterproof ankle bracelet
for dips in the ocean.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.119
Still a prison,

22:51.119 --> 22:54.873
just surrounded by white sands
instead of iron bars.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.376
And... when we say no?

22:58.752 --> 23:01.755
My buyers are off in the wind,
get their nukes elsewhere,

23:01.755 --> 23:05.050
and you have countless deaths
on your hands.

23:06.718 --> 23:10.847
You'll be lucky if we get you
a six-by-eight in Leavenworth.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.608
We will consider it.

23:23.068 --> 23:23.902
Come.

23:31.159 --> 23:34.746
Hey. What are you thinking?
We're not making a deal with him.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.123
Kyle is a match.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.383
Creamer. We need creamer.

23:46.883 --> 23:47.801
Yes.

23:49.052 --> 23:50.429
Your mother's freaking out.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.349
You don't look too good either.

23:55.725 --> 23:58.603
Well, I got a sick kid
and a frantic wife at the hospital.

23:58.603 --> 24:01.106
- What if he says no?
- He's gonna say yes.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.316
What if he wants to see Romi
or wants visitation?

24:03.316 --> 24:05.402
What if... he wants custody?

24:05.402 --> 24:06.820
Romi is your daughter.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.532
Get your act together and calm down.
You hear me?

24:12.367 --> 24:14.536
I'm gonna help Mom in the kitchen.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.121
Sissy.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.957
Sorry I'm late.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.792
- Oh, hey.
- Oh.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.377
Emma, Barry, Luke.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.879
- Bean dip.
- Yeah.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.423
Thanks very much.
Very kind of you to drop this off.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.925
No, hold on.
I was invited to be here.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.636
You must be confused
because this is family only.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.847
- Barry's here.
- Well, Barry's family.

24:33.847 --> 24:34.931
Damn straight.

24:35.515 --> 24:38.018
- What's going on?
- He's just dropping off bean dip.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.562
No, no, no, no.
I invited Donnie here for support.

24:40.562 --> 24:43.482
I don't want Kyle to feel like
he's walking into a buzz saw

24:43.482 --> 24:45.066
with all the people around here.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.776
It's on a need-to-be-here basis.

24:46.776 --> 24:47.777
Okay, Luke, please.

24:47.777 --> 24:50.989
How do we even explain
Donald's relationship to Romi?

24:50.989 --> 24:55.118
- Mom's husband's mother's boyfriend?
-  I'll take care of it.

24:55.118 --> 24:58.663
Tally, it's fine. I don't wanna make
a difficult situation worse.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.248
I'll be the bigger man and go.

25:00.790 --> 25:01.875
- Can you walk me out?
- Sure.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.879
- I'll, um, call you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

25:11.885 --> 25:12.844
You must be Kyle.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.638
Yeah. Hi.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.348
Do the right thing.

25:18.683 --> 25:19.976
Kyle, hi.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.228
It's nice to meet you.

25:22.938 --> 25:23.980
Please come in.

25:36.826 --> 25:38.828
- I'll do it.
- Thank you.

25:39.412 --> 25:44.251
But... my buddy's a doctor,
and he told me there's risks.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.336
Infection, nerve damage...

25:46.336 --> 25:48.463
My livelihood could be impacted,

25:48.463 --> 25:53.051
so I think it's only fair
that we discuss cost.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.594
Our insurance covers everything.

25:54.594 --> 25:56.638
I don't mean the cost of the procedure.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.432
I mean... <i>my</i> cost.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.518
Missed work, recovery time--

26:01.518 --> 26:03.478
- How much?
- Hundred fifty thousand.

26:04.437 --> 26:06.773
We can't afford that.

26:07.482 --> 26:11.111
Mm. Pretty nice house.
You got a couple cars in the driveway.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.320
You can figure it out.

26:12.320 --> 26:16.283
I'm not gonna risk my life for nothing
just to save some kid I've never even met.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.618
- You sneaky son of a bitch.
- Emma.

26:18.618 --> 26:21.746
He doesn't give a shit about Romi.
He's doing this for a payday.

26:21.746 --> 26:25.834
Emma, you hit him, he walks out that door,
and Romi doesn't get what she needs.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.547
Think it over. You have my number,

26:31.548 --> 26:33.842
and you have my number.

26:38.847 --> 26:39.973
What just happened?

26:39.973 --> 26:42.434
- Oh, now you talk.
- What does that mean?

26:42.434 --> 26:45.061
Your kid is sick,
and you stand there and say nothing.

26:45.061 --> 26:47.731
- Emma, that's not helpful.
- Dad told me to stay calm.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.774
Who are you to talk to me like that?
You don't have a child.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.694
You don't know what I'm going through.
Just shut up, Emma.

26:52.694 --> 26:55.447
- Don't talk to your sister like that.
- Of course you stick up for her.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.157
She's the son you always wanted.

26:58.783 --> 26:59.993
He's gonna be okay.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.956
Luke, you're gonna have to sell your ship.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.417
It won't fetch
the kind of money he wants.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.961
-  Really?
- It could take months to find a buyer.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.631
What about a second mortgage?

27:12.631 --> 27:15.342
- We already took one out years ago.
- Oh.

27:16.509 --> 27:17.844
What are we gonna do?

27:19.679 --> 27:20.597
Don't worry.

27:20.597 --> 27:23.391
I'm not gonna let anything happen
to our granddaughter.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.394
I promise.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.105
Okay.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.192
Oh my God.

27:42.952 --> 27:46.831
What's a kindergartener doing
with a six-figure uncut diamond?

27:46.831 --> 27:49.501
This is just a little souvenir
from Antwerp.

27:50.001 --> 27:51.753
I felt bad that I missed her recital.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.463
Antwerp? Is that a conflict diamond?

27:53.463 --> 27:56.132
If you call killing a bunch of guys
in a warehouse a conflict.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.842
I mean, It's no big deal.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.387
It's no different than me
getting you the necklace for graduation.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.055
You mean for missing my graduation?

28:02.055 --> 28:04.891
Because all your gifts
were apologies for you being gone.

28:04.891 --> 28:06.267
I see what this is all about.

28:06.851 --> 28:10.271
You wanted to go after Boro,
you wanted to kick Kyle's ass,

28:10.271 --> 28:12.982
and you couldn't do either,
so you're pissed off at me.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.402
You could not be more off base.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.028
I feel bad for you.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.822
All the mistakes you made
with Oscar and me,

28:18.822 --> 28:21.574
you're making the same ones with Romi,
and you don't even realize it.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.077
God forbid something happens to her,
and you'll--

28:24.661 --> 28:27.497
You'll have blown your second chance
at getting it right.

28:37.924 --> 28:40.009
Hey, hey! Look what I got.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.261
Found it at a tag sale.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.388
I was looking for something
to cheer Romi up.

28:43.388 --> 28:47.308
A rocking horse? Carter, the kid
can barely lift her head off her pillow.

28:47.308 --> 28:49.602
I know, it's just for when she's better.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.980
- Are you okay?
- Not really.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.983
You said you'd do a donor drive,
not... not do arts and crafts.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.693
Okay. I-- Wow.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.571
Um, I really thought
you said Kyle was a match.

28:59.571 --> 29:02.699
I never said he'd donate,
and now he won't until we pay him.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.576
I didn't know that.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.036
It's fine. We'll--
I will make some more calls.

29:07.036 --> 29:08.621
I'm spinning a million plates,

29:08.621 --> 29:12.709
and I just asked you to handle
this one thing.

29:13.501 --> 29:15.587
Okay. Okay, okay. Look, look.

29:15.587 --> 29:19.883
Em, you are somebody
who likes to control everything.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.676
From academics, to your career,

29:21.676 --> 29:25.472
to picking a handsome fiancé
who just kind of goes with the flow.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.015
I think you're having a hard time

29:27.015 --> 29:29.601
with the fact that
you can't control Romi's illness.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.520
So why don't you... stain this horse with me

29:32.520 --> 29:34.981
and just take five minutes
to think about something else?

29:37.567 --> 29:38.443
Right.

29:39.068 --> 29:39.903
Yeah, okay.

29:39.903 --> 29:43.323
'Cause the one thing every sick child
wants is a toy from the Renaissance.

29:44.741 --> 29:48.787
I was just looking for someone
who could lighten my load a little bit.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.788
No, no. Wait, Emma--

30:03.051 --> 30:04.844
Nice to meet you, Mr. Polonia.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.554
Name's Norm.

30:07.388 --> 30:10.308
That art store has so many things
and so many aisles.

30:10.308 --> 30:14.270
I had a dickens of a time
finding the right glitter glue.

30:14.270 --> 30:15.980
Someone should make an app for that.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.819
Norwegian <i>krumkakers</i>.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.237
My <i>mormor's</i> recipe.

30:23.863 --> 30:26.115
Let me know if you want me
to pop one in your mouth for ya.

30:28.576 --> 30:29.536
<i>Suit yourself.</i>

30:39.629 --> 30:43.675
This... is worth $300,000.

30:43.675 --> 30:47.512
All you have to do is go to the hospital,
take some tests, make a donation,

30:47.512 --> 30:49.639
and this is yours.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.059
I'm gonna walk into
that jewelry store over there.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.310
Guy says it's real...

30:56.396 --> 30:57.438
you got a deal.

30:57.438 --> 30:58.857
Oh, no backsies.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.900
If you say yes,

31:00.900 --> 31:03.570
the doctors are gonna set
everything in motion,

31:03.570 --> 31:06.239
and they're gonna kill
Romi's immune system.

31:06.239 --> 31:10.118
If she doesn't get a donation
within the next 24 hours, she'll die,

31:10.702 --> 31:11.703
and so will you.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.501
I know. Nothing's gonna happen to the kid.

31:22.797 --> 31:24.340
I knew we could trust you.

31:27.969 --> 31:29.220
I know this looks pretty,

31:29.220 --> 31:32.515
but there's a unique blend
of bonding agents to these art supplies.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.559
They're gonna feel like
a line of fire ants

31:34.559 --> 31:36.060
marching right up your ding dong.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.813
Now let's get those slacks off.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.773
<i>Stop. We're pulling the plug.</i>

31:40.773 --> 31:42.567
I have a 24-hour cancellation policy.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.485
You will be paid in full.

31:44.485 --> 31:45.570
Boro,

31:46.070 --> 31:47.488
let's cut a deal.

31:55.246 --> 31:58.124
- What the hell?
- An extradition order came down from OFAC.

31:58.124 --> 32:01.044
We lose custody of Boro in 48 hours.
I have to make a deal.

32:01.044 --> 32:04.213
This is horseshit!
Tell OFAC to O-fuck themselves.

32:04.213 --> 32:07.508
See, I don't get the luxury
of flying off the handle,

32:07.508 --> 32:08.676
being unprofessional,

32:08.676 --> 32:10.720
and cursing at my superiors
when I don't get what I want.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.848
We have him right in that room.
You can't--

32:13.848 --> 32:17.685
It is not your place to tell me
what I can and cannot do, Officer Brunner.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.395
And let me be clear,

32:19.395 --> 32:23.191
you raise your voice again
to me in my building,

32:23.691 --> 32:26.527
you'll have a choice
between tech support and unemployment.

32:26.527 --> 32:27.528
Am I clear?

32:29.489 --> 32:30.323
Yeah.

32:36.245 --> 32:37.080
You okay?

32:44.087 --> 32:47.548
What the hell is
the Office of Foreign Assets Control doing

32:47.548 --> 32:49.425
sending a South American terrorist

32:49.425 --> 32:51.594
that was arrested by Americans in Greece

32:51.594 --> 32:53.680
to Zimbabwe, of all places?

32:53.680 --> 32:55.306
Boro supplied the explosives

32:55.306 --> 32:58.643
that were used in a terrorist attack
in Harare four years ago.

32:58.643 --> 32:59.852
There's enough corruption there.

32:59.852 --> 33:03.189
He will most likely buy his way
out of incarceration within weeks.

33:03.189 --> 33:06.484
But the US wants to play nice
with the Zimbabwe government

33:06.484 --> 33:09.821
to access lithium mines
in the Masvingo Province.

33:11.447 --> 33:13.157
It's always about money, isn't it?

33:13.157 --> 33:15.243
If we want Boro's buyers,
there's no time to waste.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.370
He will cooperate if we agree

33:17.370 --> 33:20.873
never to prosecute him for crimes,
known and unknown,

33:20.873 --> 33:22.375
prior to the date of the agreement.

33:22.375 --> 33:26.129
So if we discover that he blew up
an orphanage a year ago,

33:26.129 --> 33:27.255
we couldn't touch him?

33:27.255 --> 33:28.506
Correct.

33:28.506 --> 33:32.051
But we don't have to tell him
about the extradition order to Zimbabwe.

33:32.719 --> 33:36.514
Once his African pals drop all the charges
against him, he'll be a free man.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.516
Free to continue business as usual.

33:38.516 --> 33:42.228
Free to be nailed for whatever
twisted nonsense he gets up to next.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.022
All right, it's not perfect,

33:44.022 --> 33:47.316
but I'm trying to turn chickenshit
into chicken salad here.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.278
Maybe you can explain that
to your daughter.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.196
Emma's having a real tough day.

33:52.196 --> 33:56.325
She's so pissed about Boro
and very upset about Romi.

33:56.325 --> 33:57.285
Not an excuse.

33:57.285 --> 34:00.788
I'm telling you as her senior officer,
not as her father,

34:00.788 --> 34:01.831
keep her in line.

34:01.831 --> 34:02.749
Understood.

34:02.749 --> 34:06.669
But I hope that you know
how good she really is.

34:06.669 --> 34:08.296
She's invaluable to the team.

34:08.296 --> 34:12.050
She's a quick problem-solver.
She has guts. She has great instincts,

34:12.050 --> 34:15.470
and I'm saying that as a senior officer
and as her father.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.597
Thank you for the evaluation.

34:19.432 --> 34:20.308
You're welcome.

34:21.184 --> 34:24.395
And... thank you for being on my side,

34:24.395 --> 34:26.189
eighty-sixing the torture.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.900
Oh, I didn't take anybody's side.

34:30.943 --> 34:33.404
Frankly, I'm the only one in this building

34:33.404 --> 34:36.324
who's earned the right
to have an opinion on torture.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.914
This was not an IED, was it?

34:45.541 --> 34:49.170
Whatever they did to you,
you obviously withstood it.

34:50.713 --> 34:51.964
You did your duty.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.553
Whatever happened to you is your business,

34:58.429 --> 35:01.349
but this conversation... never took place.

35:03.684 --> 35:04.602
Thank you.

35:05.645 --> 35:06.646
I'll owe you one.

35:15.279 --> 35:18.783
Steak from Mastro's,
milkshake from Bob's Big Boy.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.701
Now, talk.

35:21.327 --> 35:25.373
Uh, the buyers and I communicate
via an encrypted dark web message board.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.794
They're pinged
once I upload an authentication video

35:29.794 --> 35:32.713
of myself with the bomb
to prove it's operational.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.049
How do you prove it's operational?

35:37.969 --> 35:39.303
State-sponsored satellite,

35:39.303 --> 35:42.765
one of America's many enemies,
one of my many allies.

35:42.765 --> 35:45.935
It can trace the bomb's
unique nuclear signature

35:45.935 --> 35:47.854
and send verification to the buyers.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.022
All I need is my weapon.

35:50.022 --> 35:51.899
Your suitcase nuke has been disarmed,

35:52.483 --> 35:54.819
but it still has active nuclear material.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.738
But we won't allow an enemy
to ping our HQ.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.991
- We shoot the video off-site.
- Fine by me.

36:00.575 --> 36:01.868
Once the video is online,

36:02.618 --> 36:06.247
interested buyers will confirm
with ice cube emojis,

36:06.247 --> 36:07.665
indicating everything's cool.

36:08.249 --> 36:12.128
You track their IP addresses,
exact locations, commence raids.

36:13.087 --> 36:14.422
I promised you whales.

36:14.422 --> 36:15.965
My customer list

36:16.591 --> 36:19.302
is a who's who
of the world's baddest leviathans.

36:23.806 --> 36:26.726
I'm sorry that you turned out this way.

36:27.310 --> 36:31.272
I turned out this way...
because you killed Omar Polonia.

36:31.272 --> 36:33.482
He was a dangerous man.

36:33.482 --> 36:37.236
But by killing him, I deprived
a little sweet boy of his father.

36:37.236 --> 36:40.823
I thought I could fill that space
with peanut brittle and gifts

36:40.823 --> 36:42.283
and sending you to school,

36:42.283 --> 36:44.660
but every kid needs a father figure there.

36:44.660 --> 36:47.330
So quality time with you
would've made me a different man?

36:47.330 --> 36:51.167
Quality time is a lie peddled
by busy parents to alleviate guilt.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.668
It's quantity time that counts.

36:52.668 --> 36:56.589
So you're there for the wounded knees,
and doing science projects,

36:56.589 --> 36:59.550
falling asleep watching cartoons together.

36:59.550 --> 37:03.304
I'm sorry I deprived you
of all of these wonderful things.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.058
Do you regret killing my father?

37:07.725 --> 37:10.603
No, but I regret what it did to you.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.612
- I still think this deal's a mistake.
- I know.

37:19.612 --> 37:21.364
That's why I want you to sit this one out.

37:21.364 --> 37:25.034
Go to the hospital and support the family.
They need you there.

37:25.034 --> 37:28.579
Plus, you're too upset and distracted
right now to be in the field.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.873
I've been working Boro for months.

37:30.873 --> 37:33.793
What did you tell me
about choosing work over family?

37:34.543 --> 37:36.295
It's too late for me, but not for you.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.964
Take Aldon with you to the hospital.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.799
Aldon, get your shoulder checked.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.425
Injured, you're no good to me.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.468
Yes, sir.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.720
And Roo and I,
we're gonna take Boro upstate.

37:45.304 --> 37:47.390
Oh yeah. Tag team back again.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.141
Keep me updated, okay?

37:49.767 --> 37:50.601
Yeah.

37:51.477 --> 37:52.979
-  Come.
-  All right.

38:21.007 --> 38:23.509
Okay, Boro, time for your close-up.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.554
As soon as this video is posted,

38:27.138 --> 38:31.559
our source will confirm that this device
contains legitimate nuclear material.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.687
Interested parties, you know the drill.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.188
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

38:41.652 --> 38:46.532
Okay, the video will be uploaded
to the darkest of the web in a minute.

38:53.622 --> 38:54.457
What's going on?

38:54.457 --> 38:56.208
Kyle flaked. No one can find him.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.210
<i>I knew that SOB couldn't be trusted.</i>

38:58.210 --> 39:00.463
Get in touch with Ops.
They know where he is.

39:00.463 --> 39:01.380
Okay.

39:01.380 --> 39:04.133
<i>Now, Emma, just be smart
with the way you handle him.</i>

39:04.133 --> 39:07.094
Just keep your cool.
We still need his help.

39:07.678 --> 39:08.512
Yeah.

39:10.514 --> 39:11.432
Fuck.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.228
Director, Boro's video
is live to the underworld.

39:16.228 --> 39:18.230
We'll be tracking scumbags in no time.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.066
Copy that.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.151
Dot's on her way.

39:23.694 --> 39:24.528
What's up with Kyle?

39:26.072 --> 39:27.031
Got him.

39:29.992 --> 39:31.535
Car's parked at a bar in Chappaqua.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.828
<i>The Roundabout.</i>

39:32.828 --> 39:35.081
- That's where we met him.
- Thank you, Tina.

39:35.873 --> 39:38.167
Jeez, little girl's dying,
this guy's pounding brewskies?

39:38.167 --> 39:39.502
Just drive faster.

39:45.216 --> 39:49.553
Hey, uh, just wanted to say
thanks for helping us track Kyle,

39:50.596 --> 39:53.682
and sorry for pushing our second date.

39:53.682 --> 39:54.642
Second?

39:55.559 --> 39:58.687
First one only lasted two bites of pizza
before we got the call about Romi.

39:58.687 --> 40:02.983
But if I say our second date,
it moves things forward.

40:02.983 --> 40:06.779
And I, uh... want things to move forward.

40:07.363 --> 40:08.280
Same.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.908
Whenever you're ready for date <i>número dos</i>,

40:10.908 --> 40:12.243
you know where I'll be.

40:16.330 --> 40:17.790
Ice cube in Yemen.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.877
Everything's cool in Syria.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.806
- You're in the wrong place.
- Shit.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.185
My father gave you something valuable.

40:38.185 --> 40:39.812
Now you have to give
something valuable to us.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.772
Actually,
I don't have to do anything, okay?

40:41.772 --> 40:44.692
Hey, man, kudos for getting
those tests done. Takes guts.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.069
But I'm guessing once the docs listed

40:47.069 --> 40:49.488
the cover-their-ass,
one-in-a-million procedure risk,

40:49.488 --> 40:51.282
it got too real, and you ran.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.742
And there's no shame in that, man.
You're human.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.119
But that kid is your responsibility--

40:55.119 --> 40:57.663
I'm just a sperm donor, like her pop said.

40:57.663 --> 41:00.332
And as such, I'm under no legal obligation
to follow through.

41:00.332 --> 41:04.211
My buddy did two years at Touro Law School
and he told me so, so...

41:04.211 --> 41:06.547
Oh, what'd your buddy say
about stealing diamonds?

41:06.547 --> 41:08.924
That possession is nine-tenths of the law.

41:08.924 --> 41:12.052
- Oh.
- Look, I'm planted here, okay?

41:12.052 --> 41:13.512
What you gonna do about it?

41:16.849 --> 41:19.894
I'm gonna strike your Adam's apple,
making it impossible for you to talk.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.353
Your head'll drop instinctively,

41:21.353 --> 41:23.939
and we'll drag you out of here
like you're our buddy on a breakup bender.

41:23.939 --> 41:26.442
In 30 seconds,
you'll be in the trunk of our car,

41:26.442 --> 41:28.903
in five, you'll be wishing
you'd come voluntarily,

41:28.903 --> 41:30.654
and in two, I'm hitting ya.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.364
Oh, you mean business, huh, sweetheart?

41:32.364 --> 41:34.450
-  Okay, here we go.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.910
Oh, sorry, folks.

41:36.535 --> 41:39.538
Girlfriend dumped him tonight, huh?
One too many.

41:39.538 --> 41:40.456
There we go.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.376
- Sending coordinates in Mukalla.
- Ditto for Damascus.

41:44.376 --> 41:47.087
Units from Al-Tanf and Lemonnier
are incoming.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.632
SEALs have landed in Islamabad.

41:50.966 --> 41:53.844
-  <i>Hold until all units are in place.</i>

41:58.182 --> 41:59.016
What's going on?

41:59.016 --> 42:00.434
- We picked up our friend.

42:00.434 --> 42:02.228
He's still a little hesitant.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.230
-  Hey, let me out of here!
- Uh...

42:04.230 --> 42:07.775
Just figured a... a workout
might clear his mind.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.443
Bringing in a personal trainer.

42:09.443 --> 42:10.361
Norm?

42:15.950 --> 42:16.784
It's your call.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.410
<i>I trust your instincts.</i>

42:18.410 --> 42:20.788
- Thank you.

42:23.457 --> 42:24.917
Goddamn, let me out!

42:29.547 --> 42:31.298
- Brunner.
- The favor you owe me?

42:31.298 --> 42:32.424
That was fast.

42:32.424 --> 42:34.969
<i>We need to use Merry Fitness
for personal reasons.</i>

42:34.969 --> 42:36.971
I need you to turn a blind eye.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.472
<i>Asking for permission?</i>

42:39.431 --> 42:40.349
Forgiveness.

42:41.684 --> 42:42.726
It's for Romi.

42:44.687 --> 42:46.272
We never had this conversation.

42:48.816 --> 42:51.235
Don't you wuss out on me.
We're gonna pry that door open,

42:51.235 --> 42:54.363
find those sales files
that prove that they're liars,

42:54.989 --> 42:57.449
and then we're gonna take them
to the Chamber of Commerce.

42:57.449 --> 42:58.576
- Hm.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.244
- You ready?
- Yeah.

43:00.869 --> 43:01.787
- I think so.
- Okay.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.039
Get down!

43:14.717 --> 43:15.551
What's going on?

43:35.321 --> 43:37.698
Jesus, Mary, and Jehoshaphat.

43:37.698 --> 43:40.284
I think they're doing
more than just fudgin' sales.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.077
And we got it all.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.124
Last troops are getting in position.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.459
Be ready on my signal.

43:51.337 --> 43:52.338
I'm sorry, what?

43:52.338 --> 43:53.922
I can't seem to hear you.
You gotta speak up.

43:53.922 --> 43:55.174
Fuck you!

44:01.138 --> 44:02.389
Norm, hi. Come on in.

44:02.389 --> 44:04.683
Boy, you guys calling
sure lifted my loafers.

44:04.683 --> 44:07.353
- It's so good to feel needed.
- Hey, Norm.

44:07.353 --> 44:09.688
Think you can get some viable bone marrow
out of this cat?

44:09.688 --> 44:11.315
Absitively posolutely.

44:11.315 --> 44:13.901
The procedure's easy enough,
according to Wikipedia.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.152
Wikipedia?

44:15.152 --> 44:16.779
Don't worry, just joshing.

44:16.779 --> 44:19.490
I read an article
in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>.

44:19.490 --> 44:20.866
I read most of it.

44:21.533 --> 44:23.577
Per your request for propofol,

44:23.577 --> 44:25.996
my supplier, the Great Dane,
is completely off the grid,

44:25.996 --> 44:28.666
so we're going to have to do this
the old-timey way.

44:28.666 --> 44:31.794
- Buckle up, boy-o.

44:31.794 --> 44:33.879
Now, you're gonna have the instinct

44:33.879 --> 44:35.839
to go to the authorities
when all of this is over,

44:36.423 --> 44:37.758
but if you talk to anyone,

44:37.758 --> 44:40.427
we're gonna have to track you down,
take you again.

44:40.427 --> 44:43.055
What'll happen to you after that
will be infinitely worse

44:43.055 --> 44:44.515
than what's about to happen to you.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.308
I'm sorry.

44:46.308 --> 44:47.685
The thing is...

44:49.269 --> 44:50.896
you should've just gone to the hospital.

44:54.900 --> 44:58.654
Hi. I'm Norm.
We're going to be working together today.

44:58.654 --> 45:01.740
Hope you don't mind,
but I always like a little bit of music.

45:06.078 --> 45:08.038
Now let's get those slacks off of ya.

45:08.664 --> 45:09.957
Now! Go! Go! Go!

45:12.668 --> 45:15.129
<i>There's no one here.
This place is empty.</i>

45:15.129 --> 45:16.088
They're all empty.

Medevac is gonna be here within minutes.

47:02.569 --> 47:05.614
- Great. Now let's get after him.
- The chopper already left.

47:05.614 --> 47:07.449
Within seconds, they'll be on a plane,

47:07.449 --> 47:09.576
and within minutes,
they'll be over international waters.

47:09.576 --> 47:11.703
- There still might be time.
- Maybe.

47:11.703 --> 47:14.540
There's definitely gonna be
enough time for me to see Romi.

47:14.540 --> 47:15.999
My family needs me now.

47:15.999 --> 47:17.125
I got to go.

47:34.768 --> 47:38.689
- Hey. I heard the procedure went well.
- So far, so good.

47:40.816 --> 47:43.193
- She's a tough kid.
- Well, just like her aunt.

47:43.861 --> 47:46.071
- So the hospital's none the wiser?
- Nope.

47:46.071 --> 47:47.781
Barry loved wearing an EMT uniform

47:47.781 --> 47:49.950
and driving the ambulance
Motor Pool gave him,

47:49.950 --> 47:51.451
so, yeah, win-win.

47:51.451 --> 47:52.619
Oh, good for him.

47:54.496 --> 47:55.330
You read the debrief?

47:55.330 --> 47:57.708
Boro got captured on purpose
to steal the nuke back,

47:57.708 --> 48:00.460
and appears all the IP addresses
were spoofed by Cain.

48:00.460 --> 48:01.962
Totally useless to us.

48:02.629 --> 48:04.965
Theory is Boro got suspicious
when Dane called,

48:04.965 --> 48:06.508
so he embedded a tracker in his body,

48:06.508 --> 48:08.760
so his team could stay
in striking distance.

48:09.761 --> 48:11.972
I wish we could've been there,
could've done something.

48:11.972 --> 48:14.224
Then we wouldn't have gotten
what Romi needed.

48:15.100 --> 48:18.061
And you were right,
we had to go the brutal route.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.063
Maybe, but my dad was right too.

48:20.063 --> 48:23.150
Torture is very real
when it's five feet in front of you.

48:27.571 --> 48:28.405
Aldon, I--

48:30.073 --> 48:31.992
For all that you did, thank you,

48:32.826 --> 48:33.827
sincerely.

48:34.453 --> 48:35.996
You were having a rough day.

48:35.996 --> 48:38.707
I figured you could use someone
to lighten your load a bit.

48:58.518 --> 48:59.937
-  Hey.
- Hey.

49:00.938 --> 49:03.565
You guys-- You came over together?

49:03.565 --> 49:06.652
No, we, uh, ran into each other
in the parking lot.

49:11.073 --> 49:12.491
Uh, I'm gonna grab a coffee.

49:13.116 --> 49:15.035
- Good to see you, Carter.
-  Yeah, you too.

49:15.035 --> 49:16.912
And, uh, nice horse.

49:16.912 --> 49:17.913
Yeah, thanks.

49:22.000 --> 49:22.834
Hey.

49:22.834 --> 49:25.337
I'm really sorry
about how I acted yesterday.

49:26.630 --> 49:29.007
- The horse really does look great.
- It's unfinished.

49:29.007 --> 49:32.344
I spilled the bottle of stain
you bought for Nana Pat's clock.

49:32.344 --> 49:34.388
Then I called the store
you said you got it from.

49:34.388 --> 49:35.722
They said they don't carry it.

49:35.722 --> 49:37.432
They said nobody does

49:37.432 --> 49:40.477
'cause it was banned
by the Environmental Protection Agency,

49:40.477 --> 49:43.271
and that it's only available
in Central Asia.

49:44.272 --> 49:46.817
- What are you insinuating?
- I don't even know.

49:46.817 --> 49:48.068
You... You tell me.

49:49.152 --> 49:51.738
You think they'd admit to selling
illegal products over the phone?

49:51.738 --> 49:54.282
I don't know,
I asked the clerk to grab the best stuff,

49:54.282 --> 49:55.575
she pulled it out of the back.

49:55.575 --> 49:58.662
That's it. That's the story
behind the mysterious wood stain.

50:00.414 --> 50:02.290
Okay, if you say so.

50:03.667 --> 50:06.294
Okay, you know what?
Carter, I just tried to do something nice.

50:06.294 --> 50:08.088
If you're gonna be weird about it...

50:08.588 --> 50:09.756
I'm gonna go see Romi.

50:15.846 --> 50:16.680
Hey.

50:18.306 --> 50:19.141
Hey.

50:21.518 --> 50:24.938
- What's up with the pony?
- Something I was fixing up for Romi.

50:26.648 --> 50:28.108
I think...

50:29.317 --> 50:30.736
Emma's being unfaithful.

50:31.695 --> 50:32.946
What makes you say that?

50:32.946 --> 50:34.239
She's kind of distant,

50:34.239 --> 50:36.825
and she was making excuses
for running off.

50:38.952 --> 50:40.704
Do you think there could be someone else?

50:44.374 --> 50:45.500
Honestly...

50:50.130 --> 50:51.214
I don't know.

50:52.382 --> 50:55.552
I just know that Emma has gone through
a lot these last few days.

50:57.345 --> 50:59.264
And I know that she loves you.

50:59.848 --> 51:00.682
I love her.

51:01.725 --> 51:03.935
And I don't wanna lose her.

51:05.437 --> 51:09.816
So I'm all ears, Mr. Brunner.
What do I do?

51:09.816 --> 51:12.778
I know what it's like
to lose a woman that you love.

51:13.695 --> 51:15.572
If you feel like she's slipping away...

51:18.241 --> 51:19.201
fight for her.

51:47.062 --> 51:48.814
- How's our little angel?
-  Better.

51:48.814 --> 51:51.024
She'll be here for a couple of weeks,

51:51.024 --> 51:53.944
but the doctors say
she's getting stronger by the minute.

51:54.528 --> 51:57.531
- That's good.
- I sent Oscar and Sandy back home to rest.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.825
I'll stay here till she wakes up.

52:01.827 --> 52:02.953
I'm gonna stay here too.

52:02.953 --> 52:05.330
I want Pee-Pa
to be the first face she sees.

52:14.965 --> 52:15.882
She okay?

52:22.139 --> 52:23.056
I don't know.

52:34.025 --> 52:35.110
You're very tired.

52:36.403 --> 52:37.737
You've been through a lot.

52:39.197 --> 52:40.407
You need some rest.

52:43.201 --> 52:45.328
Why don't you close your eyes
a little bit?

52:50.500 --> 52:51.626
There you are.

53:17.360 --> 53:20.864
I've been wondering,
how did you manage to pay off Kyle?

53:21.615 --> 53:22.449
I didn't.

53:24.326 --> 53:25.869
I changed his mind.

53:26.453 --> 53:27.287
Hm.
