00:20.121 --> 00:21.854
Come on over a minute.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.455
I just had some ideas

00:23.457 --> 00:26.492
that I'd been thinking about
for quite a while...

00:26.494 --> 00:29.128
About modulation.

00:29.130 --> 00:33.399
It seems to me
that there are...
http://worldmkv.com/

00:33.401 --> 00:37.703
Different themes in life.

00:39.305 --> 00:41.707
<i> And one of my main jobs,</i>

00:41.709 --> 00:43.175
it seems to me,

00:43.177 --> 00:46.045
is to help
through the mass media,

00:46.047 --> 00:47.980
for children...

00:47.982 --> 00:49.882
To help children

00:49.884 --> 00:54.253
through some of the difficult
modulations of life.

00:54.255 --> 00:57.823
Because it's easy,
for instance, to go from c...

01:00.760 --> 01:03.195
- ...to f.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.432
But there are some modulations
that aren't so easy.

01:06.434 --> 01:10.702
For instance,
to go from f to f-sharp,

01:10.704 --> 01:14.106
you've got to weave
through all sorts of things.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.241
And it seems to me,
if you've got somebody

01:16.243 --> 01:18.544
to help you as you weave...

01:18.546 --> 01:20.879
Maybe this is just
too philosophical.

01:20.881 --> 01:25.184
Maybe I'm trying to...
To combine, uh, things that...

01:25.186 --> 01:28.754
That can't be combined,
but it makes sense to me.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.429
14 years ago, a television
program for children

01:37.431 --> 01:41.633
made its inauspicious debut
on station wqed in Pittsburgh.

01:41.635 --> 01:45.537
Its host, Fred Rogers,
an ordained minister

01:45.539 --> 01:48.073
with an abiding interest
in children

01:48.075 --> 01:50.109
and an equally abiding belief

01:50.111 --> 01:52.711
that they deserve more
from television.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.712
-Mr. Rogers?
-Yes.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.281
Where do you live?

03:02.283 --> 03:04.783
-I live in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. -Oh.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.818
- Did you want to...

03:06.820 --> 03:08.954
- Pardon me?
<i>- They are gathered</i>

03:08.956 --> 03:11.323
<i> in this television studio</i>
<i> with Fred Rogers,</i>

03:11.325 --> 03:14.860
<i> an adult who cares</i>
<i> just about them.</i>

03:14.862 --> 03:19.364
<i> His reward is the love</i>
<i> of millions of children.</i>

03:19.366 --> 03:20.632
I want to tell you something.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.167
What would you like to tell me?

03:22.169 --> 03:24.403
-I like you.
-I like you, my dear.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.939
Thank you very much
for telling me that.

03:29.976 --> 03:32.544
<i> We had a</i>
<i> director that once said to me,</i>

03:32.546 --> 03:34.546
<i> "if you take</i>
<i> all of the elements</i>

03:34.548 --> 03:36.215
<i> "that make good television</i>

03:36.217 --> 03:37.716
"and do the exact opposite,

03:37.718 --> 03:39.785
you have
<i> mister Rogers' neighborhood."</i>

03:40.887 --> 03:44.056
<i> Low production values,</i>
<i> simple set,</i>

03:44.058 --> 03:46.458
<i> unlikely star.</i>

03:48.061 --> 03:50.896
<i> Yet, it worked.</i>

03:50.898 --> 03:55.267
<i> Because he was saying</i>
<i> something really important.</i>

03:57.437 --> 04:00.038
<i> Love is</i>
<i> at the root of everything.</i>

04:00.040 --> 04:03.909
<i> All learning, all parenting,</i>

04:03.911 --> 04:06.912
<i> all relationships.</i>

04:07.914 --> 04:10.249
Love or the lack of it.

04:12.352 --> 04:16.521
<i> And what we see and hear</i>
<i> on the screen</i>

04:16.523 --> 04:19.524
<i> is part of who we become.</i>

04:20.627 --> 04:23.228
<i> He had a singular vision</i>

04:23.230 --> 04:24.863
<i> of kindness and love,</i>

04:24.865 --> 04:28.567
<i> but a question that I think of</i>
<i> a lot, in terms of Fred,</i>

04:28.569 --> 04:31.303
<i> is whether his attempt</i>

04:31.305 --> 04:35.707
to influence America
succeeded or not.

04:45.551 --> 04:48.220
<i> I was all set</i>
<i> to go to the seminary</i>

04:48.222 --> 04:50.122
<i> to become a minister,</i>

04:50.124 --> 04:54.226
<i> but I went home my senior year</i>
<i> for a vacation,</i>

04:54.228 --> 04:56.995
<i> and I saw this new thing</i>
<i> called television.</i>

04:56.997 --> 04:59.731
<i> Tootsie roll!</i>
<i> America's favorite candy...</i>

05:01.167 --> 05:02.834
<i> And I saw people</i>

05:02.836 --> 05:05.003
<i> throwing pies</i>
<i> in each other's faces.</i>

05:05.005 --> 05:09.608
<i> And I thought, "this could be</i>
<i> a wonderful tool.</i>

05:09.610 --> 05:13.011
<i>Why is it being used this way?"</i>

05:13.013 --> 05:15.647
<i> And so I said to my parents,</i>

05:15.649 --> 05:18.817
"you know, I don't think
I'll go to seminary right away.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.986
I think maybe I'll go
into television."

05:20.988 --> 05:24.189
And they said, "wait,
but you've never even seen it."

05:28.094 --> 05:30.629
<i> Station wqed</i>

05:30.631 --> 05:34.199
<i> is located in the heart</i>
<i> of Pittsburgh.</i>

05:34.201 --> 05:38.637
<i> His father</i>
<i>told him about this new station</i>

05:38.639 --> 05:40.005
that was coming along here.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.340
It was going to be called...

05:41.342 --> 05:43.709
It was called
educational television.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.980
<i> Nobody wanted</i>
<i> to do a children's program.</i>

05:48.982 --> 05:50.949
And I said, "well, we need
a children's program."

05:50.951 --> 05:52.718
<i> And I said,</i>
<i> "well, I'll produce it</i>

05:52.720 --> 05:55.187
<i> "and play some music</i>
<i> in the background.</i>

05:55.189 --> 05:57.789
<i> "We'll get some free films,</i>

05:57.791 --> 06:01.293
<i> and, Josie,</i>
<i> you can introduce them."</i>

06:01.295 --> 06:05.397
And then we discovered
the awful fact

06:05.399 --> 06:07.999
that when you got free film,

06:08.001 --> 06:12.804
<i> it was often brittle,</i>
<i> and it would break.</i>

06:12.806 --> 06:15.407
<i> And if you were</i>
<i> on the air live,</i>

06:15.409 --> 06:17.008
<i> you had to do something.</i>

06:17.010 --> 06:21.146
<i> Somebody had given me</i>
<i> this little tiger puppet.</i>

06:21.148 --> 06:25.484
<i> I pushed it through</i>
<i> the clock and said,</i>

06:25.486 --> 06:27.419
"hi, Josie. It's 5:02,

06:27.421 --> 06:30.489
and Columbus
discovered America in 1492,"

06:30.491 --> 06:32.391
and then just went
right back in.

06:32.393 --> 06:35.861
<i> And that's how</i>
<i> the puppetry began.</i>

06:35.863 --> 06:38.096
<i> We never expected</i>
<i> to use puppets.</i>

06:40.333 --> 06:42.868
You know that... so much of it

06:42.870 --> 06:47.005
was the necessity being
the mother of that invention.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.443
My friend,
Daniel striped tiger.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.980
How do you do? How do you do?

06:56.182 --> 06:58.683
<i> The interesting thing was--</i>

06:58.685 --> 07:02.087
dad remembered
being six and seven

07:02.089 --> 07:03.922
and eight and nine years old.

07:03.924 --> 07:08.593
<i> That inner child</i>
<i> never really went away.</i>

07:08.595 --> 07:10.896
<i> I had every imaginable</i>

07:10.898 --> 07:14.132
<i> childhood disease,</i>
<i> even Scarlet fever.</i>

07:14.134 --> 07:18.603
<i> Whenever I was, uh,</i>
<i> quarantined,</i>

07:18.605 --> 07:20.405
<i> I would be in bed a lot.</i>

07:20.407 --> 07:22.407
<i> I would put up my knees,</i>

07:22.409 --> 07:26.144
<i> and they would be mountains</i>
<i> covered with the sheet.</i>

07:26.146 --> 07:29.714
<i> And I'd have all these</i>
<i> little figures moving around,</i>

07:29.716 --> 07:32.684
<i> and I'd... I'd make them talk.</i>

07:34.053 --> 07:37.956
<i> I had to make up</i>
<i> a lot of my own fun.</i>

07:39.258 --> 07:41.126
Eh! Take that.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.861
Eh, eh, eh!

07:43.996 --> 07:46.398
What's the matter?

07:46.400 --> 07:47.899
<i> Over time, Fred became</i>

07:47.901 --> 07:50.001
unsatisfied with
<i> the children's corner.</i>

07:50.003 --> 07:51.403
He thought that it was

07:51.405 --> 07:52.804
<i> simple and slapstick.</i>

07:52.806 --> 07:54.473
<i> And he said he really wanted</i>
<i> to concentrate</i>

07:54.475 --> 07:57.442
<i> on the seminary, so he wanted</i>
<i> to stop for a while.</i>

08:02.315 --> 08:04.449
<i> His ordination was</i>

08:04.451 --> 08:08.253
<i> as an evangelist</i>
<i> for television.</i>

08:08.255 --> 08:11.490
It was pretty way out there
for the presbyterian church.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.926
<i> With television,</i>

08:14.928 --> 08:19.331
Fred wanted to focus
on the very young.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.534
What do you think it is?

08:22.536 --> 08:23.768
Lion!

08:23.770 --> 08:25.303
A lion. Great.

08:26.974 --> 08:32.376
<i> Back in the 1950s,</i>
<i> there was a school of people</i>

08:32.379 --> 08:33.712
at the university of Pittsburgh

08:33.714 --> 08:36.748
<i> looking at early childhood</i>
<i> education.</i>

08:45.625 --> 08:46.958
What was it?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.793
<i> They felt that physicians</i>

08:48.795 --> 08:51.396
<i> needed a training ground</i>

08:51.398 --> 08:55.534
<i> so that they had a sense</i>
<i> of where human behavior</i>

08:55.536 --> 08:57.636
was coming from
from the very beginning.

08:57.638 --> 09:02.007
<i> Dr. Benjamin Spock</i>
<i> was part of it.</i>

09:02.009 --> 09:05.477
<i> Berry brazelton, the famous</i>
<i>pediatrician, was a part of it.</i>

09:05.479 --> 09:10.649
<i>Erik Erikson, the extraordinary</i>
<i>psychologist, was a part of it.</i>

09:10.651 --> 09:12.918
And Fred's part of that group.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.719
<i> He-he became part of the group</i>

09:14.721 --> 09:16.988
<i> as a student</i>
<i> of Margaret mcfarland.</i>

09:16.990 --> 09:19.558
Margaret mcfarland:
Fred, I think,

09:19.560 --> 09:22.327
to the child,
the television program

09:22.329 --> 09:25.964
between you and the child
is a real relationship.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.267
<i> For him to say,</i>

09:29.269 --> 09:31.536
<i> "the feelings of a young child</i>

09:31.538 --> 09:37.042
<i> are every bit as powerful</i>
<i> as our adult feelings,"</i>

09:37.044 --> 09:38.276
he was radical.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.679
I know everyone says that,
but he was radical.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.848
I've always felt that...

09:43.850 --> 09:47.452
That I didn't need
to put on a funny hat

09:47.454 --> 09:49.120
or jump through the hoop

09:49.122 --> 09:52.857
<i> to have a relationship</i>
<i> with a child.</i>

09:54.093 --> 09:56.861
<i> I went to visit</i>
<i> with a new nursery school.</i>

09:56.863 --> 10:01.032
I had never met
these children before.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.535
And I walked in,

10:03.537 --> 10:07.238
<i> and there was a long stare</i>
<i> from most of them.</i>

10:07.240 --> 10:11.910
<i> And one little boy by the name</i>
<i> of Thatcher spoke first.</i>

10:11.912 --> 10:15.146
<i> And all he said was,</i>

10:15.148 --> 10:19.284
"my doggy's ear came off

10:19.286 --> 10:21.620
in the automatic washer."

10:21.622 --> 10:23.822
And there was silence.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.157
Just complete silence.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.892
It was as if,

10:27.894 --> 10:31.229
"this is your test, Mr. Rogers.

10:31.231 --> 10:36.301
Are you still in touch
with childhood?"

10:36.303 --> 10:39.237
And so I said,

10:39.239 --> 10:43.808
"sometimes that happens
to toys, doesn't it?

10:43.810 --> 10:46.578
"Their ears come off
or their legs come off,

10:46.580 --> 10:49.414
"but that never happens to us.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.283
"Our ears don't come off.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.319
"Our noses don't come off.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.421
Our arms don't come off."

10:56.423 --> 10:59.090
And Thatcher's eyes
were getting bigger

10:59.092 --> 11:01.359
and bigger and bigger,
and he said,

11:01.361 --> 11:03.595
"and our legs don't come off?"

11:03.597 --> 11:05.930
And I said, "no, they don't."

11:07.266 --> 11:10.101
<i> And immediately,</i>
<i> all of the other children</i>

11:10.103 --> 11:14.773
<i> started asking questions,</i>
<i> and poignant questions.</i>

11:14.775 --> 11:17.042
It was just as if, you know,

11:17.044 --> 11:18.810
"we shall now open the door.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.445
"You have passed the test.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.880
You may come in."

11:27.053 --> 11:28.820
<i> And what he wanted to do</i>

11:28.822 --> 11:31.389
<i> was to take all of that</i>
<i> that he learned</i>

11:31.391 --> 11:33.958
<i> in television work,</i>

11:33.960 --> 11:37.796
<i> add to that</i>
<i> the sense of ministry</i>

11:37.798 --> 11:41.800
<i> and the child development</i>
<i> background.</i>

11:41.802 --> 11:45.203
<i> It became </i>
mister Rogers' neighborhood.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.913
<i> A neighborhood was a place</i>

11:54.915 --> 11:59.217
<i> where, at times</i>
<i> that you felt worried,</i>

11:59.219 --> 12:01.586
<i> scared, unsafe,</i>

12:01.588 --> 12:02.987
would take care of you,

12:02.989 --> 12:06.091
<i> would provide understanding,</i>
<i> safety.</i>

12:06.093 --> 12:09.394
<i> That's what the neighborhood</i>
<i> was for Fred.</i>

12:13.365 --> 12:17.102
<i> Television has the chance</i>

12:17.104 --> 12:21.940
<i>of building a real community...</i>

12:23.743 --> 12:25.977
<i> ...out of an entire country.</i>

12:30.015 --> 12:34.018
<i> The neighborhood</i>
<i> is not a fantasy place</i>

12:34.020 --> 12:36.688
<i> where all these</i>
<i> different people got together</i>

12:36.690 --> 12:39.057
<i> and everything</i>
<i> was happily ever after.</i>

12:39.059 --> 12:41.960
<i> When you have diverse people</i>
<i> together</i>

12:41.962 --> 12:43.795
<i> with their different opinions,</i>

12:43.797 --> 12:45.130
you have conflict.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.965
And that's what happens
in the neighborhood.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.301
You have conflict,
real conflict.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.939
Halt, trolley.

12:54.941 --> 12:59.110
Give me your name, rank
and serial number.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.747
<i> "King Friday xiii</i>

13:02.749 --> 13:06.050
"establishes border guard.

13:06.052 --> 13:09.487

13:11.223 --> 13:15.326
<i> The parallels between what</i>

13:15.328 --> 13:17.729
<i> and what is happening</i>

13:54.167 --> 13:56.301
<i> that people</i>
<i> were changing things.</i>

13:56.303 --> 13:59.637
<i> So his reaction</i>
<i> as the authority</i>

13:59.639 --> 14:02.273
<i> was to build a wall.</i>

14:10.483 --> 14:12.884
Remember our battle cry, Edgar?

14:12.886 --> 14:15.620
Down with the changers!

14:21.862 --> 14:25.530
-'Cause we're on top.
-That's right.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.804
I can't believe
what a broad area we covered.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.339
Oh, dear.
-Edgar, Edgar,

14:34.341 --> 14:37.342
wh-what do you think he means
by "any trouble"?

14:37.344 --> 14:39.677
Fred didn't want you
ad-libbing,

14:39.679 --> 14:41.479
putzing around with the words,

14:41.481 --> 14:43.815
<i> because he was always trying</i>
<i> to get a message across</i>

14:43.817 --> 14:45.583
<i> in every show.</i>

14:45.585 --> 14:49.487
I want there to be peace
in this neighborhood.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.657
It's been a hard time
for everyone.

14:52.659 --> 14:56.361
Well, I really do hope
that what you say will work.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.162
Do you have the tags
on the bottom?

14:58.164 --> 14:59.864
Yes, I... I put 'em on.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.833
-Look, see if you like them.
-Good.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.334
"Love," this one says.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.938
And then we float them over
into the castle

15:06.940 --> 15:08.773
<i> so that great uncle Friday</i>
<i> will know</i>

15:08.775 --> 15:11.342
<i> that the whole neighborhood</i>
<i> wants peace.</i>

15:11.344 --> 15:13.511
Paratroopers!

15:13.513 --> 15:14.846
Fire the Cannon!

15:14.848 --> 15:16.281
Hold it, king Friday.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.949
-Well, what is it?
-They're not paratroopers.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.083
They're...
They're messages of peace.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.718
Look at this: "Tenderness."

15:20.720 --> 15:22.754
Messages of peace?

15:22.756 --> 15:24.856
"Peaceful co-existence."

15:24.858 --> 15:26.090
-Wait.
-You see, that one was...

15:26.092 --> 15:27.525
They're peaceful messages, sir.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.560
Let us stop all fighting.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.530
Stop all fighting now.

15:32.532 --> 15:35.733
--Oh, superb! Superb!

15:35.735 --> 15:38.036
Meow, wonderful, meow.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.138
That was the first week.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.907
That's how it got started.

15:57.056 --> 15:58.723
<i> From the early days</i>

15:58.725 --> 16:00.792
<i> of</i> mister Rogers' neighborhood

16:00.794 --> 16:04.062
<i> until the end of that program,</i>
<i> he came in the door</i>

16:04.064 --> 16:06.230
every day the same way.

16:07.266 --> 16:08.666
Hi.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.068
Hello.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.236
And he changed to the sweater

16:12.238 --> 16:14.405
<i> to give a sense</i>
<i> that we are gonna have</i>

16:14.407 --> 16:16.641
<i> this relaxing time together.</i>

16:16.643 --> 16:17.675
Whoop.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.510
Change the shoes.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.585
Some food for the fish.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.254
Picture picture on the wall,

16:30.256 --> 16:32.657
would you kindly tell us all,

16:32.659 --> 16:34.759
is Mr. mcfeely on his way here?

16:34.761 --> 16:37.762
<i> My job was</i>
<i> to be the prop person.</i>

16:37.764 --> 16:39.664
And then he said, "oh,

16:39.666 --> 16:42.100
"i know you've done
some... some acting.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.869
<i> "I'd like you</i>
<i> to play the character</i>

16:44.871 --> 16:46.004
<i> of the delivery man."</i>

16:46.006 --> 16:47.538
I must go off, Mr. Rogers.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.607
I have a lot of deliveries
today in the neighborhood.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.543
So I became Mr. mcfeely
on the spot.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.181
<i> The trolley left for its house</i>

16:57.183 --> 17:01.185
<i> into the neighborhood</i>
<i> of make-believe.</i>

17:02.187 --> 17:04.989
Boomerang, toomerang,
soomerang!

17:04.991 --> 17:07.492
<i> Anything could</i>
<i> happen in make-believe.</i>

17:07.493 --> 17:08.693
Oh!

17:08.694 --> 17:10.028
But make-believe was not real.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.462
I mean, there was
a distinction.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.398
<i> Fred never appeared</i>
<i> in make-believe.</i>

17:14.401 --> 17:16.567
<i> Actors did. The puppets did.</i>

17:16.569 --> 17:18.368
<i> There's the clock</i>

17:18.371 --> 17:21.138
<i> where Daniel striped tiger</i>
<i> lives.</i>

17:22.642 --> 17:25.643
<i> Next you see</i>
<i> king Friday xiii's castle.</i>

17:25.645 --> 17:29.180
<i> King Friday xiii</i>
<i> is one of the few remaining</i>

17:29.182 --> 17:31.649
<i> benevolent despots.</i>

17:31.651 --> 17:36.821
These characters are...
Were people in his life.

17:36.823 --> 17:37.922
Queen Sara

17:37.924 --> 17:41.225
<i> would obviously be my mom.</i>

17:41.227 --> 17:43.161
I'd just like to say

17:43.163 --> 17:46.164
what a fine person
my husband is.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.666
Why, Sara.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.436
<i> None of us</i>
<i> like to think of lady Elaine</i>

17:51.438 --> 17:54.505
as my aunt,
but we wonder about that.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.509
In the beginning,
she was a witch.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.744
I heard that.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.345
Here's a squirt.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.414
What can I say?

18:04.516 --> 18:06.584
<i> In a beautiful tree</i>

18:06.586 --> 18:09.887
<i> lived x the owl</i>
<i> and henrietta pussycat.</i>

18:09.889 --> 18:13.591
Meow, meow, beautiful day,
meow, meow, neighborhood.

18:15.028 --> 18:18.229
<i> And then,</i>
<i> at the end of every program,</i>

18:18.231 --> 18:20.798
<i> we came back to Fred's</i>
<i> television house.</i>

18:20.800 --> 18:25.636
<i>And to help children understand</i>
<i> all of these experiences,</i>

18:25.638 --> 18:27.405
he put that into a song.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.053
And children need to hear that.

18:42.055 --> 18:44.589
I don't think
that anybody can grow

18:44.591 --> 18:48.659
unless he really is accepted
exactly as he is.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.397
<i> I think he was</i>
<i> one of those people</i>

18:53.399 --> 18:55.733
<i> who would do their work</i>
<i> seriously</i>

18:55.735 --> 18:59.337
<i> and they hope that someone</i>
<i>will pick up on the seriousness</i>

18:59.339 --> 19:02.473
<i> of what they're about.</i>

19:02.475 --> 19:04.242
<i> There were times</i>
<i> when he thought,</i>

19:04.244 --> 19:07.745
<i> "will people ever understand</i>
<i> that I'm not just a klutzy guy</i>

19:07.747 --> 19:10.748
"who's fumbling around
in a '50s living room with...

19:10.750 --> 19:12.116
With weird curtains?"

19:12.118 --> 19:15.753
<i> Wgbh in Boston decided to have</i>

19:15.755 --> 19:18.356
<i> something called</i>
<i> a Mr. Rogers day.</i>

19:18.358 --> 19:20.424
There was just a woman
in... in gbh

19:20.426 --> 19:22.793
who was in their PR department
who loved the program,

19:22.795 --> 19:25.530
and I think
her colleagues said...

19:25.532 --> 19:27.765
<i> You know, I think they thought</i>
<i> it was really simple,</i>

19:27.767 --> 19:30.434
<i> kind of '50s, square.</i>

19:30.436 --> 19:32.637
And she said, "no, I really
want to bring him here,

19:32.639 --> 19:35.306
and I want families to be able
to come and see him."

19:37.010 --> 19:40.278
<i> And the line to get in</i>

19:40.280 --> 19:43.214
<i> was blocks and blocks long</i>

19:43.216 --> 19:45.850
<i> before they even</i>
<i> opened the doors.</i>

19:45.852 --> 19:48.019
<i> And the word got around</i>
<i> really quickly</i>

19:48.021 --> 19:51.589
<i> that there's something</i>
<i> going on with this guy.</i>

19:53.559 --> 19:57.028
Mr. Rogers, Mr. Rogers.

19:57.030 --> 20:00.031
I like you as you are.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.035
<i> A little boy came up</i>

20:04.037 --> 20:09.807
to him and said, "Mr. Rogers,
how did you get out?"

20:09.809 --> 20:12.577
<i> And so he talked</i>
<i> to the little boy,</i>

20:12.579 --> 20:14.478
<i> explained what television</i>
<i> was all about.</i>

20:14.480 --> 20:15.846
<i> And the little boy's just</i>

20:15.848 --> 20:19.483
taking it all in, going,
"mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm."

20:19.485 --> 20:22.486
And he...
When Fred finished, he said...

20:22.488 --> 20:24.322
The little boy said,

20:24.324 --> 20:26.824
"how are you gonna
get back in?"

20:32.899 --> 20:35.032
<i> There was a whole</i>

20:35.034 --> 20:39.103
<i>spiritual dimension to his work</i>
<i> in the television business</i>

20:39.105 --> 20:41.672
<i> to be inclusive.</i>

20:41.674 --> 20:43.674
<i> He did this without ever</i>

20:43.676 --> 20:47.745
<i> identifying himself</i>
<i> as a minister.</i>

20:49.081 --> 20:52.450
<i> He didn't wear a collar.</i>
<i> He wore a sweater.</i>

20:54.052 --> 20:56.787
And he preached in that context

20:56.789 --> 21:00.858
in a way more effective
than anyone I've ever seen,

21:00.860 --> 21:05.529
because it wasn't a sermon
like, uh, an oratorical thing.

21:05.531 --> 21:09.600
It was a communication
right into their hearts.

21:13.639 --> 21:16.741
<i> He was a life-long</i>
<i> registered republican,</i>

21:16.743 --> 21:20.645
<i> and if you look at the values</i>
<i> that Mr. Rogers represented,</i>

21:20.647 --> 21:23.247
<i> it's influenced by his faith.</i>

21:23.249 --> 21:27.118
His christianity was this kind
of wide open christianity

21:27.120 --> 21:30.554
<i> that was accepting thinking</i>
<i> from all other places</i>

21:30.556 --> 21:34.725
<i> while never departing</i>
<i> from the Christian faith.</i>

21:35.894 --> 21:37.662
<i> Fred's theology was:</i>

21:37.664 --> 21:40.164
<i> Love your neighbor</i>
<i> and love yourself.</i>

21:40.166 --> 21:42.900
<i> And he saw that communication</i>

21:42.902 --> 21:46.237
<i> as the most deeply</i>
<i> spiritual thing</i>

21:46.239 --> 21:48.506
<i> that he could be doing.</i>

21:52.010 --> 21:54.312
<i> When I look at the camera,</i>

21:54.314 --> 21:57.348
<i> I think of one person.</i>

21:58.617 --> 22:02.186
<i> Not any specific person,</i>
<i> but one person.</i>

22:02.188 --> 22:05.756
<i> It's very, very personal.</i>

22:08.126 --> 22:10.761
<i> The space between</i>
<i> the television screen</i>

22:10.763 --> 22:13.664
<i> and whoever happens</i>
<i> to be receiving it,</i>

22:13.666 --> 22:16.000
<i> I consider that</i>
<i> very holy ground.</i>

22:18.270 --> 22:20.371
<i> A lot happens.</i>

22:20.373 --> 22:22.273
<i> A lot happens there.</i>

22:28.780 --> 22:31.382
For somebody
who was in television,

22:31.384 --> 22:33.484
he was just...
He hated television.

22:38.123 --> 22:40.458
Here, buddy. It's all yours.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.526
Wow, look at this!

22:42.528 --> 22:44.462
Hey! What about me?

22:44.464 --> 22:46.964
<i> In this country, the child</i>

22:46.966 --> 22:49.633
<i> is appreciated</i>
<i> for what he will be.</i>

22:49.635 --> 22:53.204
He will be
a great consumer someday.

22:53.206 --> 22:57.408
<i> The quicker we can get them</i>
<i> to go out and buy, the better.</i>

22:57.410 --> 23:01.312
<i> There's so much of that</i>
<i> in this country.</i>

23:01.314 --> 23:03.647
Mr. Ellison, I think you
have felt strongly

23:03.649 --> 23:05.483
about some aspects of this.

23:05.485 --> 23:10.688
Public television
could make a contribution.

23:10.690 --> 23:13.991
As the American people

23:13.993 --> 23:17.728
becomes aware of itself,
it discovers itself.

23:17.730 --> 23:21.866
We do not know
as much as we should know

23:21.868 --> 23:26.237
about who we are, what we are
and how we differ.

23:26.239 --> 23:30.040
<i> How will man use his miracles?</i>

23:30.042 --> 23:34.245
<i> The answer just begins</i>
<i> with public television.</i>

23:34.247 --> 23:36.514
<i> We want most of all</i>

23:36.516 --> 23:39.517
to enrich man's spirit,

23:39.519 --> 23:42.186
and that is the purpose
of this act.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.294
And then Nixon
became president,

23:50.296 --> 23:52.463
and he wanted
to cut the funding.

23:52.465 --> 23:55.099
<i> The beginnings of pbs</i>

23:55.101 --> 23:59.036
<i> was gonna probably be</i>
<i> dismantled by Richard Nixon,</i>

23:59.038 --> 24:04.975
<i> whose approach to media</i>
<i> was to threaten stations</i>

24:04.977 --> 24:08.078
if they didn't behave
politically.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.548
<i> Nixon had a problem</i>
<i> with his budget.</i>

24:10.550 --> 24:13.083
<i> He had to find money</i>
<i> for the Vietnam war.</i>

24:13.085 --> 24:15.886
<i> It wasn't a lot of money</i>
<i> in today's terms,</i>

24:15.888 --> 24:16.921
but he wanted
to cut the budget.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.256
<i> In the midst of all this,</i>

24:19.258 --> 24:21.058
<i> Fred Rogers gets</i>

24:21.060 --> 24:22.660
to go before congress,

24:22.662 --> 24:26.297
argue for $20 million
of funding

24:26.299 --> 24:28.466
to sort of solidify pbs,

24:28.468 --> 24:30.501
<i> in front of John pastore,</i>

24:30.503 --> 24:32.970
<i>who's a senator who had already</i>

24:32.972 --> 24:35.406
<i> sort of made</i>
<i> his congressional bones</i>

24:35.408 --> 24:37.141
<i> by attacking television.</i>

24:37.143 --> 24:39.477
This is going to be
a thorough hearing.

24:39.479 --> 24:42.847
This is going to be a hearing
not to reach for a headline,

24:42.849 --> 24:45.082
but to reach for a result.

24:45.084 --> 24:47.585
<i> There had been</i>
<i> two days of hearings,</i>

24:47.587 --> 24:49.787
and he hasn't been
very impressed.
http://worldmkv.com/

24:49.789 --> 24:51.922
<i> If you'd been watching</i>
<i> those hearings</i>

24:51.924 --> 24:53.657
and you had to bet
on whether or not

24:53.659 --> 24:55.092
pbs was going to keep going--
no.
http://worldmkv.com/

24:55.094 --> 24:57.461
That educational television
should permanently

24:57.463 --> 24:59.930
struggle for subsistence
is intolerable.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.665
All right,
who's the next witness?

25:03.035 --> 25:05.803
<i>Senator pastore told the group,</i>

25:05.805 --> 25:08.439
"I've heard everybody read
your testimonies.

25:08.441 --> 25:10.040
"I don't want anyone
to read anymore.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.942
I'm tired of hearing
the reading."

25:11.944 --> 25:14.778
<i> When I heard about that,</i>
<i> I thought, "uh-oh, Fred."</i>

25:14.780 --> 25:17.014
<i> All right, Rogers,</i>
<i> you've got the floor.</i>

25:18.784 --> 25:20.818
- May I use this?
<i>- And I could hear</i>

25:20.820 --> 25:23.621
in his voice the... the nerves.

25:23.623 --> 25:26.857
Senator pastore,

25:26.859 --> 25:30.494
this is a philosophical
statement

25:30.496 --> 25:33.364
and would take
about ten minutes to read.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.533
So I'll not do that. Uh...

25:36.668 --> 25:40.337
One of the first things
that a child learns

25:40.339 --> 25:43.140
in a healthy family is trust.

25:43.142 --> 25:47.311
And I trust what you have said,
that you will read this.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.680
It's very important to me.

25:49.682 --> 25:52.349
I care deeply about children.

25:52.351 --> 25:54.518
My first children...

25:54.520 --> 25:56.654
Will it make you happy
if you read it?

25:56.656 --> 25:58.155
I'd just like to talk about it,

25:58.157 --> 25:59.757
-if it's all right.
-All right, sir.

25:59.759 --> 26:02.693
This is what I give.

26:02.695 --> 26:07.164
I give an expression of care
every day to each child

26:07.166 --> 26:10.834
to help him realize
that he is unique.

26:10.836 --> 26:13.504
I end the program by saying,

26:13.506 --> 26:16.073
"you've made this day
a special day

26:16.075 --> 26:18.375
"by just your being you.

26:18.377 --> 26:22.079
"There's no person
in the whole world like you.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.915
And I like you
just the way you are."

26:24.917 --> 26:28.252
And I feel that if we
in public television

26:28.254 --> 26:31.922
can only make it clear

26:31.924 --> 26:36.860
that feelings are mentionable
and manageable,

26:36.862 --> 26:39.096
we will have done
a great service.

26:40.365 --> 26:42.733
Uh, could I tell you the words

26:42.735 --> 26:46.136
of one of the songs,
which I feel is very important?

26:46.138 --> 26:47.438
Yes.

26:47.440 --> 26:51.408
This has to do with
that good feeling of control,

26:51.410 --> 26:52.810
which I feel that...

26:52.812 --> 26:56.313
That children need to know
is there.

26:56.315 --> 26:59.984
And it starts out, "what do you
do with the mad that you feel?"

26:59.986 --> 27:02.786
And that first line came
straight from a child.

27:02.788 --> 27:06.056
I work with children,
doing puppets in...

27:06.058 --> 27:10.227
In very personal communication
with small groups.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.563
"What do you do
with the mad that you feel

27:12.565 --> 27:15.332
"when you feel so mad
you could bite?

27:15.334 --> 27:18.969
"When the whole wide world
seems oh so wrong

27:18.971 --> 27:22.740
"and nothing you do
seems very right?

27:22.742 --> 27:25.609
"It's great to be able to stop

27:25.611 --> 27:28.245
"when you've planned
a thing that's wrong

27:28.247 --> 27:31.682
"and be able to do
something else instead

27:31.684 --> 27:33.784
"and think this song.

27:33.786 --> 27:37.988
"I can stop when I want to,
can stop when I wish,

27:37.990 --> 27:40.824
"can stop, stop, stop anytime.

27:40.826 --> 27:44.128
"Know that there's something
deep inside

27:44.130 --> 27:47.364
that helps us become
what we can."

27:48.867 --> 27:53.337
I think it's wonderful.
I think it's wonderful.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.774
Looks like you just earned
the $20 million.

28:06.618 --> 28:09.953
<i> Fred Rogers is</i>
<i> easily the star of the show,</i>

28:09.955 --> 28:11.955
and if children had votes,

28:11.957 --> 28:14.658
public television would be
on easy street tomorrow.

28:17.630 --> 28:20.064
- Oh, wow.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.466
Everything just
sort of exploded.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.668
<i> You know,</i>
<i> suddenly there was press</i>

28:24.670 --> 28:27.404
<i> beating a path to our door.</i>

28:27.406 --> 28:29.406
<i> Good evening.</i>
<i> I was in Pittsburgh</i>

28:29.408 --> 28:31.141
a few days ago

28:31.143 --> 28:32.476
<i> doing a bit</i>
<i> of investigative reporting</i>

28:32.478 --> 28:33.977
<i> on a man named Fred Rogers.</i>

28:33.979 --> 28:35.646
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

28:35.648 --> 28:37.314
Wonderful. Meow!

28:37.316 --> 28:39.483
<i> Mr. Rogers</i>
<i> does ten different voices</i>

28:39.485 --> 28:41.185
<i> for ten different puppets.</i>

28:41.187 --> 28:44.521
Well, a copperhead
is poisonous, is it not?

28:44.523 --> 28:46.523
<i> He writes, he's the producer,</i>

28:46.525 --> 28:49.860
<i> he is the chief performer,</i>
<i> and he is a marvel.</i>

28:49.862 --> 28:51.662
<i> Fred Rogers,</i>
<i> as best I can tell,</i>

28:51.664 --> 28:55.165
<i> has managed to escape</i>
<i> the calloused, the embittered,</i>

28:55.167 --> 28:58.502
<i> the negative aspects</i>
<i> of being a public performer.</i>

28:58.504 --> 29:00.537
<i> He is doing the one thing</i>
<i> in the world</i>

29:00.539 --> 29:04.742
<i>that he wishes to do, and he is</i>
<i>by any definition a happy man.</i>

29:14.519 --> 29:18.021
<i> I sometimes wonder</i>
<i> myself how he ticked.</i>

29:18.023 --> 29:21.024
It's a little tough
for me to have the...

29:21.026 --> 29:23.927
Almost the second Christ
as my dad.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.230
<i> If we were</i>
<i> at the dinner table</i>

29:26.232 --> 29:28.532
<i> and he would want</i>
<i> to say something</i>

29:28.534 --> 29:30.234
<i> that wasn't necessarily</i>

29:30.236 --> 29:35.973
Mr. Rogers-like,
he would say it in

29:35.975 --> 29:37.541
<i>lady Elaine fairchilde's voice.</i>

29:37.543 --> 29:38.876
Get out here, Friday.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.477
I need to speak with you.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.781
<i> That was our cue</i>
<i> that this is the alter-ego</i>

29:43.783 --> 29:45.215
speaking now, you know,

29:45.217 --> 29:47.584
and just letting off
a little steam.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.556
<i> He and I both had childhoods</i>

29:52.558 --> 29:55.492
<i> that you weren't allowed</i>
<i> to be angry.</i>

29:55.494 --> 29:58.595
You weren't allowed
to show your anger.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.900
<i> And we were never able</i>
<i> to do it.</i>

30:04.435 --> 30:06.336
<i> It scared us.</i>

30:10.074 --> 30:13.143
<i> Music was my first language.</i>

30:14.946 --> 30:17.815
<i> I was scared to use words.</i>

30:19.752 --> 30:22.085
<i> I didn't want to be a bad boy.</i>

30:22.087 --> 30:25.522
<i> I didn't want to tell people</i>
<i> that I was angry.</i>

30:28.793 --> 30:31.829
<i> But I could show it through...</i>

30:31.831 --> 30:35.199
<i> The way I would play</i>
<i> on the piano.</i>

30:35.201 --> 30:39.269
<i> I could literally laugh or cry</i>

30:39.271 --> 30:43.440
<i> or be very angry</i>
<i>through the ends of my fingers.</i>

30:49.781 --> 30:52.449
I've always felt that you were
someone who could understand

30:52.451 --> 30:55.886
the deep feelings
or thoughts of people.

30:55.888 --> 30:59.489
Well, it took me so long
to get tame.

30:59.491 --> 31:02.125
I try to understand
how everybody else

31:02.127 --> 31:04.361
is working at it.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.463
Sometimes it isn't easy.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.966
No, but it's worth a try.

31:08.968 --> 31:12.803
Daniel was pretty much Fred.

31:12.805 --> 31:15.973
He did all the voices,
but, uh...

31:15.975 --> 31:20.878
But I think Daniel
was the real Fred.

31:22.313 --> 31:25.482
Maybe I could talk about clocks

31:25.484 --> 31:27.551
and loving...

31:27.553 --> 31:28.919
And things like that.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.821
A, b, c, d,

31:30.823 --> 31:33.257
f, g, j, k,

31:33.259 --> 31:34.591
l, m, s...

31:34.593 --> 31:38.729
Oh, lady aberlin, I just
can't go to school tomorrow.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.397
Why not, Daniel?

31:40.399 --> 31:43.233
Because I don't know
everything.

31:43.235 --> 31:47.204
<i> Daniel is articulating</i>

31:47.206 --> 31:49.907
the fears and anxieties
and feelings

31:49.909 --> 31:53.176
that Fred had as a child,

31:53.178 --> 31:55.512
but that many children have.

31:59.350 --> 32:03.353
<i> He never forgot how</i>
<i> vulnerable it was to be a kid.</i>

32:03.355 --> 32:05.555
<i> You know,</i>
<i> you're this little thing.</i>

32:05.557 --> 32:08.525
Everything else in the world
is bigger than you are,

32:08.527 --> 32:10.861
and you have to learn
everything

32:10.863 --> 32:12.596
that helps you
get through in life.

32:14.899 --> 32:17.567
<i> I think that it just</i>
<i> never left him.</i>

32:17.569 --> 32:20.637
<i> Whatever those scars</i>
<i> of his life were,</i>

32:20.639 --> 32:25.175
<i> he wanted to help heal</i>
<i> that wound, maybe?</i>

32:27.045 --> 32:30.981
It's a lot easier,
even as an adult,

32:30.983 --> 32:35.052
for me to have Daniel say...

32:35.054 --> 32:38.388
"I'm really scared.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.425
Do you think maybe
you could give me a hug?"

32:41.427 --> 32:42.893
You know?

32:42.895 --> 32:45.395
That would be hard for me
to say, "I'm really scared.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.297
Do you think
you could give me a hug?"

32:47.299 --> 32:50.801
So the difference from the...
From here to here,

32:50.803 --> 32:56.406
that doesn't seem
very far, but...

32:56.408 --> 33:00.110
It was efficacious,
to say the least.

33:00.112 --> 33:03.680
A car ran over
the jaw of your cat?

33:03.682 --> 33:05.682
-Mm-hmm.
-And what happened?

33:05.684 --> 33:07.951
It was bleeding.

33:07.953 --> 33:09.753
Oh.

33:09.755 --> 33:12.255
They tried and fixed it,

33:12.257 --> 33:15.158
but they fixed it
for a half a day,

33:15.160 --> 33:17.327
but then it died.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.997
-But then it died?
-Mm-hmm.

33:19.999 --> 33:23.100
Oh, I think that's scary.

33:23.102 --> 33:26.870
<i> All you had to do</i>
<i> was see Fred</i>

33:26.872 --> 33:31.008
<i> inhabit Daniel to...</i>

33:31.010 --> 33:32.275
Really kind of figure it out.

33:32.277 --> 33:33.744
I mean, they were symbiotic.

33:35.179 --> 33:37.948
<i> As strange as it is</i>
<i> to see a grown man</i>

33:37.950 --> 33:41.885
<i> have a symbiotic relationship</i>
<i>with kind of a dingy, you know,</i>

33:41.887 --> 33:45.689
worn-out little sock puppet,
he definitely had that.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.792
Would you give me a hug?

33:48.794 --> 33:50.127
Mm-hmm.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.795
Thank you.

33:51.797 --> 33:54.197
'Cause I needed that.

33:55.566 --> 33:58.535
I better go back in the case,
Mr. Rogers.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.370
Okay, Daniel.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.139
He's really nice.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.007
You could talk to him.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.143
Okay, Daniel.

34:10.547 --> 34:13.650
<i> Just a minute.</i>
<i> I want to show you something.</i>

34:13.652 --> 34:15.385
Okay.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.722
Wonder what.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.224
It's a balloon.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.759
Oh, a balloon.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.661
Could you blow it up for me?

34:24.663 --> 34:26.563
Surely.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.835
<i> So, this is the first year</i>

34:32.838 --> 34:34.603
<i>of</i> mister Rogers' neighborhood.

34:34.606 --> 34:38.341
<i> Daniel striped tiger</i>
<i> is there with lady aberlin,</i>

34:38.342 --> 34:40.844
<i> asking her to blow</i>
<i> a balloon up</i>

34:40.846 --> 34:42.446
and then let the air out.

34:42.447 --> 34:45.514
<i> You wonder why this</i>
<i> is in there.</i>

34:49.922 --> 34:53.123
Uh, they can't hear.
Can you hear on any of these?

34:54.592 --> 34:57.861
<i> There's something</i>
<i> I want to ask you.</i>

34:57.863 --> 35:01.198
What does "assassination" mean?

35:02.533 --> 35:04.101
What happened? Do you know?

35:04.103 --> 35:05.769
Somebody said he's been shot.

35:05.771 --> 35:09.573
Let's roll some videotape
on this out here, friends.

35:09.575 --> 35:13.376
<i> Ha-have you heard</i>
<i> that word a lot today?</i>

35:13.378 --> 35:15.112
<i> Yes.</i>

35:15.114 --> 35:18.782
And I didn't know
what it meant.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.718
Well...

35:21.720 --> 35:25.122
It means...

35:25.124 --> 35:28.325
Somebody getting killed...

35:29.560 --> 35:32.796
<i> ...in a...</i>
<i> A sort of surprise way.</i>

35:32.798 --> 35:35.165
<i>That's what happened, you know.</i>

35:35.167 --> 35:38.401
<i>That man killed that other man.</i>

35:38.403 --> 35:43.573
A lot of people are sad
and scared about it, you know.

35:43.575 --> 35:47.010
I'd rather talk about it
some other day.

35:47.012 --> 35:49.246
Whenever you like.

35:53.351 --> 35:55.785
<i> I felt that I had to speak</i>

35:55.787 --> 35:59.656
<i> to the families of our country</i>
<i> about grief.</i>

36:06.430 --> 36:10.767
<i> A plea not to leave</i>
<i> the children isolated</i>

36:10.769 --> 36:13.270
<i> and at the mercy</i>
<i> of their own fantasies</i>

36:13.272 --> 36:15.605
<i> of loss and destruction.</i>

36:18.943 --> 36:23.113
<i> Children have</i>
<i> very deep feelings</i>

36:23.115 --> 36:25.515
<i> just the way parents do,</i>

36:25.517 --> 36:29.986
<i> just the way everybody does.</i>

36:29.988 --> 36:36.159
<i> And our striving</i>
<i> to understand those feelings</i>

36:36.161 --> 36:39.863
and to better respond to them

36:39.865 --> 36:44.868
is what I feel is a most
important task in our world.

36:50.876 --> 36:54.077
<i> He realized</i>
<i> that if he really wanted</i>

36:54.079 --> 36:57.747
to communicate,
the most important thing

36:57.749 --> 36:59.549
is to listen.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.351
'Cause there's so many people
who will just

37:01.353 --> 37:05.855
lump 'em all together and say,
"hey, kids, come along.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.724
We'll see the next cartoon."

37:07.726 --> 37:09.826
And they couldn't
care less about

37:09.828 --> 37:12.829
what that cartoon
is saying to the child

37:12.831 --> 37:15.565
about such things
as human dignity.

37:27.379 --> 37:28.678
<i> Remember what was happening</i>

37:28.680 --> 37:30.847
<i> for children's television.</i>

37:30.849 --> 37:32.515
<i> It was speeding up.</i>

37:32.517 --> 37:35.852
<i> Fred was pretty radical</i>
<i> in television for that day</i>

37:35.854 --> 37:37.854
<i> in that he used time</i>

37:37.856 --> 37:39.422
totally differently.

37:45.463 --> 37:48.932
<i> To Fred, silence</i>

37:48.934 --> 37:50.867
was his delight.

38:04.982 --> 38:08.051
<i> Fred took</i>
<i> an egg timer and said,</i>

38:08.053 --> 38:10.220
"do you want to know
how long a minute is?

38:10.222 --> 38:11.554
Here. We're going to show you."

38:14.458 --> 38:18.295
<i> And we just sat there</i>
<i> for the whole minute.</i>

38:20.731 --> 38:23.900
<i> There's a lot of slow space.</i>

38:23.902 --> 38:25.902
There's no wasted space.

38:28.106 --> 38:30.006
In.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.910
Out.

38:39.283 --> 38:43.086
<i> I think silence</i>
<i> is one of the greatest gifts</i>

38:43.088 --> 38:44.988
<i> that we have.</i>

38:50.094 --> 38:52.128
<i> His questions are direct,</i>

38:52.130 --> 38:54.264
simple, short,

38:54.266 --> 38:56.166
<i> and then he waits.</i>

38:56.168 --> 38:59.836
<i> He interviewed me,</i>
<i> and he put his face</i>

38:59.838 --> 39:03.206
about three inches away
from my face,

39:03.208 --> 39:06.142
<i> says, "it's so nice</i>

39:06.144 --> 39:09.779
to see you and to be with you."

39:09.781 --> 39:13.116
<i> It scared the living daylights</i>
<i> out of me.</i>

39:13.118 --> 39:17.654
<i> But I realized this is what</i>
<i> children do with adults.</i>

39:17.656 --> 39:19.622
<i> And sometimes after</i>

39:19.624 --> 39:23.293
they answer,
he doesn't say anything else.

39:23.295 --> 39:25.528
So they say a little bit more.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.865
It's-it's a... it's a perfect
interviewing trick.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.136
Very funny. Very funny.

39:33.138 --> 39:34.471
Very funny.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.005
I'm not falling for it.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.774
Very good.

39:47.184 --> 39:51.488
Handyman negri and
officer clemmons, I presume.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.590
Correct as always,
your highness.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.525
<i> Could we take a close look</i>

39:55.527 --> 39:57.660
at, uh, your badge here,
officer clemmons?

39:57.662 --> 40:01.498
My friends, I think,
can read it.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.434
P-o-l-i-c-e.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.103
I have always felt
policemen to be

40:07.105 --> 40:09.506
the most dangerous person
in the neighborhood.

40:09.508 --> 40:12.342
<i> So, to have me playing</i>
<i> a police officer,</i>

40:12.344 --> 40:14.043
<i> I was tremendously hesitant.</i>

40:14.045 --> 40:18.181
<i> But there was something</i>
<i>reluctant about Fred to let go.</i>

40:18.183 --> 40:20.750
<i> And I said, "Mr. Rogers,</i>

40:20.752 --> 40:23.853
"i would be very happy
to be on your program

40:23.855 --> 40:28.124
as long as it doesn't
interfere with my singing."

40:39.037 --> 40:40.770
<i> And he teased me.</i>

40:40.772 --> 40:43.606
He teased me about that
for 20 years.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.942
He'd say, "officer clemmons,

40:45.944 --> 40:48.545
<i> "are we interfering</i>
<i> with your career?</i>

40:48.547 --> 40:50.580
<i> Are we interfering?"</i>

40:50.582 --> 40:52.415
<i> He was relentless.</i>

40:52.417 --> 40:54.818
<i> But he also told me, he said,</i>

40:54.820 --> 40:57.220
"that was the moment
i loved you."

40:57.222 --> 41:01.391
He said, "because you were not
going to kiss my ass."

41:01.393 --> 41:04.127
Those are Mr. Rogers' words.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.466
Mm, that feels good.

41:12.236 --> 41:13.736
Oh, there's officer clemmons.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.271
Hi, officer clemmons.
Come in.

41:15.273 --> 41:16.473
Hello, Mr. Rogers. How are you?

41:16.475 --> 41:17.841
Come on.
Why don't you sit down?

41:17.843 --> 41:19.409
Oh, sure. Just for a moment.

41:19.411 --> 41:21.144
It's so warm, I was just, uh,

41:21.146 --> 41:22.479
putting some water on my feet.

41:22.481 --> 41:23.580
Oh, it sure is.

41:23.582 --> 41:24.848
Would you like to join me?

41:24.850 --> 41:26.316
That looks awfully enjoyable,

41:26.318 --> 41:28.084
but I don't have
a towel or anything.

41:28.086 --> 41:29.419
Oh, you share mine.

41:29.421 --> 41:31.187
-Okay.
-Sure.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.156
<i> Around the country,</i>
<i> they didn't want black people</i>

41:33.158 --> 41:36.659
<i> to come and swim</i>
<i> in their swimming pools.</i>

41:36.661 --> 41:40.830
And Fred said, "that is
absolutely ridiculous."

41:40.832 --> 41:42.599
<i> Today,</i>
<i> trouble under a noon sun.</i>

41:42.601 --> 41:46.102
<i> Negroes and white rabbis</i>
<i> marched to a segregated hotel</i>

41:46.104 --> 41:47.604
<i> with these results.</i>

41:47.606 --> 41:49.305
<i> The manager, James Brock,</i>

41:49.307 --> 41:52.108
<i> told them to get off</i>
<i> his private property,</i>

41:52.110 --> 41:54.878
<i> tossed, uh, cleaning chemicals</i>
<i> inside the pool</i>

41:54.880 --> 41:57.547
<i> in an effort</i>
<i> to get the negroes to leave.</i>

41:58.782 --> 42:02.919
My being on the program
was a statement for Fred.

42:03.954 --> 42:06.789
Cool water on a hot day.

42:10.128 --> 42:13.196
<i> I think that will is the great</i>

42:13.198 --> 42:18.301
unseen and unacknowledged
ingredient in Fred's story.

42:21.906 --> 42:25.708
<i> The level of will</i>
<i> that this guy brought</i>

42:25.710 --> 42:28.811
<i> to really almost</i>
<i> all phases of his life,</i>

42:28.813 --> 42:30.580
<i> physical and spiritual...</i>

42:33.350 --> 42:38.054
<i> ...there's no better</i>
<i> manifestation of that than...</i>

42:38.056 --> 42:39.822
143.

42:39.824 --> 42:41.558
Is that your address here?

42:41.560 --> 42:42.659
Oh, no.

42:42.661 --> 42:45.495
It-it means something special.

42:45.497 --> 42:47.564
<i> 1-4-3?</i>

42:47.566 --> 42:51.067
<i> Mm-hmm. You see,</i>

42:51.069 --> 42:53.069
"i" is one letter,

42:53.071 --> 42:57.206
and "love"-- l-o-v-e--
is four letters,

42:57.208 --> 43:01.377
and "you"-- y-o-u--
is three letters.

43:01.379 --> 43:05.748
<i> Fred would go to</i>
<i> the Pittsburgh athletic club,</i>

43:05.750 --> 43:08.351
<i> and he swam a mile.</i>

43:08.353 --> 43:11.521
<i> He swam at a unhurried</i>

43:11.523 --> 43:15.558
<i> but deliberate</i>
<i> and determined pace.</i>

43:15.560 --> 43:21.197
<i> And then he got on the scale,</i>

43:21.199 --> 43:26.202
and the needle of the scale
jumped to 143.

43:26.204 --> 43:29.038
And he came off it

43:29.040 --> 43:31.641
with kind of a little smile
on his face,

43:31.643 --> 43:37.113
<i> and he told me that he</i>
<i> had weighed 143 pounds</i>

43:37.115 --> 43:39.716
<i> every day of his life</i>
<i> since, like,</i>

43:39.718 --> 43:42.819
<i> the late '50s or early '60s.</i>

43:47.091 --> 43:50.293
Now, I've thought
about this a lot.

43:50.295 --> 43:55.565
What, that... that 143-pound
thing drives me insane.

43:55.567 --> 43:56.833
Try that.

43:56.835 --> 43:58.635
I can't do that.

43:58.637 --> 44:01.337
<i> In Fred's private numerology,</i>

44:01.339 --> 44:03.306
<i> "i love you" is "1-4-3."</i>

44:03.308 --> 44:08.011
<i> So, when the needle</i>
<i> jumps to 143,</i>

44:08.013 --> 44:12.649
<i> there's, like,</i>
<i> this confirming quality.</i>

44:12.651 --> 44:14.083
There are so many weird things

44:14.085 --> 44:16.653
that I'm <i> not</i> gonna tell you.

44:18.422 --> 44:20.657
No.

44:22.027 --> 44:24.661
<i> Freddy was like</i>
<i> the little rich kid</i>

44:24.663 --> 44:26.596
<i> that lived in the big house.</i>

44:26.598 --> 44:28.197
<i> And we were all the...</i>

44:28.199 --> 44:31.668
<i> The goofball kids</i>
<i> that lived across the alley.</i>

44:31.670 --> 44:34.771
<i> We could be ourselves</i>
<i> around Fred.</i>

44:34.773 --> 44:36.372
<i> We were crazies.</i>

44:36.374 --> 44:39.776
<i> We all had long hair,</i>
<i> and we were always</i>

44:39.778 --> 44:41.878
having fun,
we were always making jokes.

44:51.956 --> 44:53.723
Those aren't mine.

44:53.725 --> 44:55.458
Whose are these?

44:58.630 --> 45:01.964
<i> If we ever</i>
<i> saw a camera laying around,</i>

45:01.966 --> 45:04.400
<i> we'd grab it,</i>
<i> I'd pull my pants down,</i>

45:04.402 --> 45:07.670
I'd take a picture of my ass
and put their camera back.

45:07.672 --> 45:11.641
And, like, then it was film,
so, like, three weeks later,

45:11.643 --> 45:13.209
you'd go to the fotomat,

45:13.211 --> 45:14.977
and you'd get
your pictures back,

45:14.979 --> 45:17.313
and there's aunt Judy,
and there's uncle Fred,

45:17.315 --> 45:19.315
and there's some guy's ass,
you know.

45:19.317 --> 45:23.052
<i> And one day, Fred brought</i>
<i> his camera into the studio,</i>

45:23.054 --> 45:25.054
<i> and he was taking pictures</i>
<i> with it.</i>

45:25.056 --> 45:28.725
And we went behind the set,
took a picture of my butt

45:28.727 --> 45:30.193
and put his camera back.

45:30.195 --> 45:33.663
He never said anything,
and, like, months later--

45:33.665 --> 45:36.165
I think it was around
christmastime--

45:36.167 --> 45:40.103
he said to somebody, "did you
give Nick his present?"

45:40.105 --> 45:42.872
And it was a poster
of that picture

45:42.874 --> 45:45.341
of me and my butt.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.419
Thank you very much.

45:56.421 --> 45:57.754
You're welcome.

45:57.756 --> 46:00.623
-Did you make these yourself?
-Mm-hmm.

46:00.625 --> 46:04.093
I... I, um...

46:04.095 --> 46:07.396
I thought...
I-i thought of x the owl,

46:07.398 --> 46:09.265
so I... so I, um...

46:09.267 --> 46:13.536
I drew him in his house
and his little door.

46:13.538 --> 46:17.106
Oh, these are real treasures.

46:17.108 --> 46:19.742
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

46:19.744 --> 46:22.578
Would you like
to see x the owl?

46:24.616 --> 46:26.482
You're a little happy.

46:26.484 --> 46:28.718
That makes you
just a little bit happy, huh?

46:28.720 --> 46:30.787
Oh, hello there.

46:32.824 --> 46:34.557
Hello, everybody.

46:34.559 --> 46:35.892
Hi.

46:35.894 --> 46:37.760
I'm x the owl.

46:37.762 --> 46:40.196
I hear you drew
a picture of me.

46:41.832 --> 46:43.566
This is a book

46:43.568 --> 46:46.903
<i> on all of the different tapes</i>
<i> that we have.</i>

46:46.905 --> 46:49.038
Here are the tapes. Here.

46:50.073 --> 46:52.175
<i> At that point, he thought</i>

46:52.177 --> 46:54.911
<i> he had done enough programs</i>

46:54.913 --> 46:56.746
that they could be repeated.

46:56.748 --> 47:00.116
Those are all
different visits...

47:00.118 --> 47:03.419
Television visits
that we have on tape.

47:03.421 --> 47:06.155
<i>He was writing, he was hosting,</i>

47:06.157 --> 47:08.090
<i> he was singing,</i>
<i> he was composing.</i>

47:08.092 --> 47:09.692
And it took a lot out of him.

47:09.694 --> 47:11.360
I think he wanted a breather.

47:11.362 --> 47:15.965
Well, next week, we'll start
to show all of these visits

47:15.967 --> 47:19.101
so everybody can see them
the whole way through.

47:19.103 --> 47:20.203
Well, I'll look forward
to that.

47:20.205 --> 47:22.305
Let's take a look at this one.

47:22.307 --> 47:25.374
<i> When you think</i>
<i> about all of those episodes,</i>

47:25.376 --> 47:28.444
there's only so many stories
you can tell, right?

47:28.446 --> 47:31.314
What's in
the future for Fred Rogers?

47:31.316 --> 47:34.884
I understand that you are
ceasing production this spring

47:34.886 --> 47:36.452
of the <i> neighborhood</i> shows.

47:36.454 --> 47:39.288
Well, it's going to give us
time to make some things

47:39.290 --> 47:41.724
that I've wanted to do
for a long time.

48:00.010 --> 48:02.378
-Hi, Katie.
-Hi, Fred.

48:03.547 --> 48:07.350
And, John, wait till
you see this quilt.

48:07.352 --> 48:11.153
<i> He wanted to do</i>
<i> some prime-time stuff</i>

48:11.155 --> 48:14.390
for adults, and so he got
funding to do a show

48:14.392 --> 48:16.759
called <i> old friends...</i>
<i> New friends.</i>

48:16.761 --> 48:20.062
<i> I wonder what it is</i>
<i> that makes one person</i>

48:20.064 --> 48:22.365
<i> push on in the face</i>
<i> of difficulty</i>

48:22.367 --> 48:26.135
<i> and makes someone else crumble</i>
<i> in helplessness.</i>

48:27.170 --> 48:28.871
What does tomorrow feel like?

48:28.873 --> 48:30.840
That big. I feel...

48:30.842 --> 48:32.341
I feel that big.

48:32.343 --> 48:34.710
There's no feeling
for tomorrow.

48:34.712 --> 48:36.913
Feeling is dead for me in here.

48:38.282 --> 48:41.684
<i> He was incredibly open.</i>

48:41.686 --> 48:44.120
He was scarily open.

48:46.456 --> 48:48.457
<i> He wanted to speak to adults.</i>

48:48.459 --> 48:50.459
<i> He kind of put</i>
<i> the puppets away.</i>

48:50.461 --> 48:53.296
But have you watched
some of these?

48:54.298 --> 48:57.033
The feeling that...

48:57.035 --> 49:01.704
This instrument is a place,

49:01.706 --> 49:05.942
that it is a country,

49:05.944 --> 49:10.046
that it's somewhere that you go

49:10.048 --> 49:13.015
to say something.

49:17.087 --> 49:18.921
What... what does this

49:18.923 --> 49:21.023
have to do with our world?

49:22.426 --> 49:25.995
I don't know any store
that's like this.

49:25.997 --> 49:29.565
Any television program
that's like this.

49:29.567 --> 49:31.534
A flower is like this.

49:32.669 --> 49:34.737
A child is like this.

49:34.739 --> 49:37.773
<i> Nobody but Fred</i>
<i> would have thought</i>

49:37.775 --> 49:40.176
<i> of doing that for adults.</i>

49:40.178 --> 49:42.244
Take number 19.

49:42.246 --> 49:45.081
Thank you for your poems
and your thoughts

49:45.083 --> 49:48.117
about loving poetry and music.

49:48.119 --> 49:51.420
You really inspired us
to make this program.

49:51.422 --> 49:54.190
I'll be with you next time.

49:54.192 --> 49:56.325
<i> But he wasn't making</i>

49:56.327 --> 49:58.260
the kind of connections
with adults on television

49:58.262 --> 50:00.496
that he thought
he might be able to make.

50:04.534 --> 50:07.269
<i> I remember opening the paper</i>

50:07.271 --> 50:09.438
<i> and reading about a child</i>

50:09.440 --> 50:12.441
jumping off a roof
with a towel around his neck

50:12.443 --> 50:15.077
<i> because he was</i>
<i> playing superman.</i>

50:17.280 --> 50:19.715
<i> And there had been a lot</i>
<i> of stories like that.</i>

50:19.717 --> 50:22.952
<i> Some children died</i>
<i> because of the injuries.</i>

50:22.954 --> 50:24.387
<i> I read it to Fred.</i>

50:24.389 --> 50:27.023
<i> It hit him, because he thought</i>
<i> he had covered</i>

50:27.025 --> 50:30.960
<i> all that there was to say</i>
<i> in child development,</i>

50:30.962 --> 50:33.195
but this was new.

50:33.197 --> 50:35.464
<i>Fred didn't become angry a lot,</i>

50:35.466 --> 50:38.401
<i> but he just became so angry</i>
<i> about the fact</i>

50:38.403 --> 50:40.970
<i> that people would mislead</i>
<i> a small child.</i>

50:40.972 --> 50:44.573
<i> And angry</i>
<i> that it was his medium</i>

50:44.575 --> 50:46.308
that was doing this.

50:51.648 --> 50:52.782
Yeah, superman.

50:55.752 --> 50:59.321
I am tired of hearing people
who have long ago

50:59.323 --> 51:02.658
set aside the concerns
of childhood,

51:02.660 --> 51:06.395
<i> telling everybody</i>
<i> what children really need.</i>

51:06.397 --> 51:09.065
I'll tell you
what children need.

51:10.333 --> 51:13.736
They need adults
who will protect them

51:13.738 --> 51:17.940
from the ever-ready molders
of their world.

51:20.611 --> 51:23.512
<i> That was the moment Fred said,</i>

51:23.514 --> 51:26.382
"i wonder if we could do
a week on superheroes,

51:26.384 --> 51:30.152
<i> talking about</i>
<i> the pretend-ness of it."</i>

51:31.021 --> 51:32.588
<i> Very quickly,</i>

51:32.590 --> 51:36.592
<i> we came back with the show. </i>

51:43.767 --> 51:44.700
Mm-hmm.

51:44.702 --> 51:46.402
<i> Uh, careful, Ana.</i>

51:46.404 --> 51:48.437
-I don't want you to...
-I think I'm flying.

51:48.439 --> 51:50.973
-I am! I'm flying!
-No, you're falling!

51:50.975 --> 51:52.908
What is going on here?

51:52.910 --> 51:55.811
Oh, Ana was trying to fly.

51:55.813 --> 51:57.880
I was using my super-skirt,

51:57.882 --> 51:59.548
and I was going
through the air.

51:59.550 --> 52:02.952
Yes, but you were going down,
and you might have gotten hurt.

52:02.954 --> 52:04.420
That's right, Ana.

52:04.422 --> 52:06.589
You have to be really careful

52:06.591 --> 52:08.491
with super-things.

52:08.493 --> 52:12.561
<i> He was cool with every kid.</i>

52:12.563 --> 52:15.397
That's the whole thing.
I mean, there were little...

52:15.399 --> 52:17.299
Kids that were...
They were little bastards.

52:17.301 --> 52:20.336
They were just rowdy,
and Fred never said,

52:20.338 --> 52:22.605
"this kid's a dick.
Get him out of here."

52:22.607 --> 52:25.074
You know, I mean,
i sure would've.

52:25.076 --> 52:27.610
<i> Fred used to say</i>

52:27.612 --> 52:30.646
that the outside world
of children's lives

52:30.648 --> 52:33.349
has changed,
but their insides haven't.

52:33.351 --> 52:37.086
<i> He realized that his work</i>
<i> wasn't through.</i>

52:37.088 --> 52:39.355
I'm Fred Rogers,
and I'd like to talk

52:39.357 --> 52:41.157
<i> with you about make-believe.</i>

52:41.159 --> 52:43.626
<i> When it goes to the next level</i>

52:43.628 --> 52:45.294
<i> is in the 1980s when he goes</i>

52:45.296 --> 52:46.428
to the theme weeks.

52:46.430 --> 52:48.030
<i> I mean, to... to do</i>

52:48.032 --> 52:49.298
<i> a week on death...</i>

52:49.300 --> 52:51.033
"Oh, hi, kids.

52:51.035 --> 52:54.670
<i> We're gonna</i>
<i> do a week on death."</i>

52:54.672 --> 52:55.938
On divorce.

52:55.940 --> 52:58.374
Some people
get married, and after a while,

52:58.376 --> 53:00.376
they're so unhappy
with each other

53:00.378 --> 53:03.112
that they don't want
to be married anymore.

53:03.114 --> 53:05.447
On children getting lost.

53:05.449 --> 53:08.284
Man, that's guts.

53:10.320 --> 53:12.988
Help! Help, help!

53:12.990 --> 53:14.657
Help, please, everybody!

53:24.901 --> 53:29.405
<i> There's a piece of paper</i>
<i> that I accidentally ran into.</i>

53:31.875 --> 53:34.910
<i> And he typed in this little</i>
<i> sheet of paper</i>

53:34.912 --> 53:38.314
<i> about how he couldn't do it,</i>

53:38.316 --> 53:40.716
that he didn't think
he was up to the task.

53:41.751 --> 53:43.719
<i> "Am I kidding myself</i>

53:43.721 --> 53:46.655
<i> "that I'm able to write</i>
<i> a script again?</i>

53:46.657 --> 53:49.658
<i> "Am I really just</i>
<i> whistling Dixie?</i>

53:49.660 --> 53:51.660
<i> "I wonder.</i>

53:51.662 --> 53:57.032
<i> "If I don't get down to it,</i>
<i> I'll never really know.</i>

53:57.034 --> 53:59.435
<i> "Why don't I trust myself?</i>

53:59.437 --> 54:02.171
<i> "After all these years,</i>

54:02.173 --> 54:06.709
<i> "it's just as bad as ever.</i>

54:06.711 --> 54:10.412
<i> "The hour cometh, and now</i>
<i> is when I've got to do it.</i>

54:10.414 --> 54:14.016
<i> "Get to it, Fred. Get to it.</i>

54:14.018 --> 54:18.454
<i> "But don't let anybody</i>
<i> ever tell anybody else</i>

54:18.456 --> 54:20.289
<i> "that it was easy.</i>

54:20.291 --> 54:22.024
<i> It wasn't."</i>

54:27.964 --> 54:30.733
<i> The time that I was with him</i>

54:30.735 --> 54:34.069
<i> going on a New York City</i>
<i> subway, all the children</i>

54:34.071 --> 54:35.971
in that crowded subway car

54:35.973 --> 54:39.041
<i> began singing</i>
<i> the</i> neighborhood <i> song.</i>

54:51.722 --> 54:54.890
<i> He might as well</i>
<i> have been an animated figure</i>

54:54.892 --> 54:57.126
<i> stepped into real life.</i>

54:57.128 --> 54:58.961
Could I try that?

54:59.964 --> 55:01.063
I brought my skates with me.

55:01.065 --> 55:02.064
I can try.

55:02.066 --> 55:04.566
Whoa.

55:08.906 --> 55:10.906
-What else do you like to do?
-Moonwalk.

55:10.908 --> 55:14.243
- Moonwalk?
- You got it. Yeah.

55:14.245 --> 55:15.811
<i> People thought he was</i>

55:15.813 --> 55:18.314
<i> such an important</i>
<i> American figure,</i>

55:18.316 --> 55:20.015
<i> they wanted him to speak out</i>

55:20.017 --> 55:21.784
on the issues of the day.

55:21.786 --> 55:24.420
<i> And so Fred grew</i>
<i> pretty comfortably</i>

55:24.422 --> 55:25.821
<i> into more of a public role.</i>

55:25.823 --> 55:27.956
You know, the earth is a name

55:27.958 --> 55:30.926
for the place
where everybody lives.

55:30.928 --> 55:32.361
And the moon

55:32.363 --> 55:34.530
<i> is the name for the place</i>

55:34.532 --> 55:36.632
<i> where the astronauts go.</i>

55:36.634 --> 55:39.301
<i> Every time we went through</i>

55:39.303 --> 55:41.503
a national
or international tragedy,

55:41.505 --> 55:44.440
<i> my impulse was always</i>
<i> to call Fred</i>

55:44.442 --> 55:45.708
<i> and put him on the radio.</i>

55:45.710 --> 55:47.776
<i>What shall we tell our children</i>

55:47.778 --> 55:50.446
<i> about the things</i>
<i> that are in the news</i>

55:50.448 --> 55:52.448
<i> that seem so difficult,</i>
<i> so tragic?</i>

55:52.450 --> 55:53.949
<i> Pilot Mike Smith,</i>

55:53.951 --> 55:56.719
<i> followed by christa mcauliffe,</i>
<i> teacher in space.</i>

55:56.721 --> 55:58.387
<i> Christa has been rehearsing</i>

55:58.389 --> 56:00.389
<i> the lessons she'll teach</i>
<i> from space.</i>

56:00.391 --> 56:01.990
Good morning.

56:01.992 --> 56:04.626
This is christa mcauliffe,
live from the <i> challenger.</i>

56:04.628 --> 56:06.362
<i> The lessons will be seen</i>

56:06.364 --> 56:08.130
<i> nationwide</i>
<i> on public television.</i>

56:08.132 --> 56:11.166
Five, four, three...

56:11.168 --> 56:13.402
<i> Two, one...</i>

56:13.404 --> 56:14.803
<i> And liftoff!</i>

56:14.805 --> 56:18.307
<i> Liftoff of the 25th</i>
<i> space shuttle mission,</i>

56:18.309 --> 56:19.808
<i> and it has cleared the tower.</i>

56:19.810 --> 56:21.543
Challenger,
<i> go at throttle up.</i>

56:21.545 --> 56:23.879
<i> Roger. Go at throttle up.</i>

56:30.320 --> 56:32.421
God, no!

56:36.092 --> 56:38.694
<i> How do we put it to children</i>

56:38.696 --> 56:40.996
<i> so they will understand?</i>

56:44.501 --> 56:48.337
<i> And part of Fred's answer</i>
<i> was always to tell children</i>

56:48.339 --> 56:51.673
<i> that we, the parents,</i>
<i> would take care of them.</i>

56:52.942 --> 56:55.344
Sometimes I found that
a difficult message myself

56:55.346 --> 56:57.379
as the parent of a young child.

56:57.381 --> 56:59.081
Sometimes I felt I was lying.

56:59.083 --> 57:01.016
I knew that there were things
in this world

57:01.018 --> 57:03.118
that I couldn't protect
my child from.

57:06.089 --> 57:08.524
<i> Sometimes we need to struggle</i>

57:08.526 --> 57:13.462
<i> with a tragedy</i>
<i> to feel the gravity of love.</i>

57:13.464 --> 57:17.766
Love is what keeps us
together and afloat.

57:30.581 --> 57:34.149
<i> You know, it must</i>
<i> be tough to be Fred Rogers...</i>

57:35.385 --> 57:39.588
...with your mission in mind

57:39.590 --> 57:41.657
and then to have parodies.

58:02.079 --> 58:04.580
<i> Eddie Murphy did that</i>

58:04.582 --> 58:06.415
mister Robinson's neighborhood,

58:06.417 --> 58:08.617
<i> and I remember meeting him,</i>

58:08.619 --> 58:10.519
<i> and he just threw his arms</i>
<i> around me</i>

58:10.521 --> 58:12.521
<i> the first time he saw me,</i>

58:12.523 --> 58:14.423
<i> and he said,</i>
<i> "the real Mr. Rogers."</i>

58:14.425 --> 58:17.793
That's, uh,
Mr. Rogers there in the, uh...

58:17.795 --> 58:19.595
-On the left.
-On the left, yeah.

58:19.597 --> 58:20.963
Uh, now, how do you react
to that?

58:20.965 --> 58:23.131
Well, some of them
aren't very funny.

58:23.133 --> 58:26.134
But I think that, uh...
That a lot of them

58:26.136 --> 58:28.437
are done with real kindness

58:28.439 --> 58:29.938
-in their hearts.
-Mm-hmm.

58:29.940 --> 58:32.875
I'm moving to a new
neighborhood

58:32.877 --> 58:35.377
where I've made a...
A new friend.

58:36.780 --> 58:39.348
Can you say "hooker"?

58:39.350 --> 58:41.283
<i> There were some that...</i>

58:41.285 --> 58:43.785
Were not as kind

58:43.787 --> 58:49.725
<i> in nature, and if they</i>
<i> made fun of the philosophy,</i>

58:49.727 --> 58:50.726
<i> that was the only thing</i>

58:50.728 --> 58:53.028
that offended him, I think.

58:53.030 --> 58:56.632
<i> The battle of the pbs stars.</i>

58:56.634 --> 59:00.669
<i> The crowd is literally buzzing</i>
<i> with excitement</i>

59:00.671 --> 59:03.205
<i> as Mr. Rogers enters the ring.</i>

59:03.207 --> 59:04.706
<i> Oh, look out there, Fred!</i>

59:04.708 --> 59:07.309
<i> Fred had such</i>
<i> a great sense of humor,</i>

59:07.311 --> 59:08.977
for the most part.

59:08.979 --> 59:11.213
<i> There's child,</i>
<i> obviously in shape</i>

59:11.215 --> 59:13.482
<i> -and ready for this fight. </i>
-Thank you.

59:13.484 --> 59:14.983
<i> But what about Rogers?</i>

59:14.985 --> 59:19.354
<i> Experts have cast aspersions</i>
<i> on his manhood itself.</i>

59:19.356 --> 59:22.024
<i> Fred would watch them</i>
<i> with the rest of us,</i>

59:22.026 --> 59:25.527
<i> and everybody would be</i>
<i> laughing, and I just wonder...</i>

59:25.529 --> 59:28.730
If a little bit
of fat Freddy came back.

59:30.033 --> 59:32.501
<i> Just before</i>
<i> getting to adolescence,</i>

59:32.503 --> 59:36.838
<i> he didn't have an easy time</i>
<i> making friends, I don't think.</i>

59:36.840 --> 59:40.609
He got a good taste of what
bullying was all about.

59:41.544 --> 59:43.211
<i> I've often wondered,</i>

59:43.213 --> 59:46.181
if there hadn't been
a fat Freddy,

59:46.183 --> 59:48.550
would there have been
a Mr. Rogers?

59:48.552 --> 59:49.851
<i> You can feel the momentum</i>

59:49.853 --> 59:51.853
<i>actually swinging toward child.</i>

59:51.855 --> 59:54.189
<i> And what just happened there?</i>

59:54.191 --> 59:55.557
<i> He grabbed a puppet!</i>

59:55.559 --> 59:57.125
<i> Oh, look at this!</i>

59:57.127 --> 01:00:00.362
<i> He's hitting child</i>
<i> with the lovable king Friday!</i>

01:00:00.364 --> 01:00:02.364
<i> And the French chef is down.</i>

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.407
A laughter record.

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:16.044
Used to play one like this
when I was a young boy.

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:18.313
You see, I felt
that the adults around me

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:21.617
were pressuring me to be
what I couldn't be yet.

01:00:21.619 --> 01:00:24.386
"Act like a grown-up,"
I'd hear them say.

01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:27.756
Well, I was afraid they'd laugh
at me when I tried.

01:00:27.758 --> 01:00:29.891
So I found a record like this,

01:00:29.893 --> 01:00:32.060
and I could make
the laughs start

01:00:32.062 --> 01:00:36.064
and make them stop
whenever I wanted to.

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:38.734
For someone who hated
to be laughed at,

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:41.737
it was a good feeling
to be in charge

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:44.139
of at least this laughter.

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:52.648
I think that those
who would try

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:56.585
to make you feel less
than who you are...

01:00:56.587 --> 01:00:58.320
I think that's
the greatest evil.

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.938
<i> There was</i>
<i> a wonderful quote from Fred.</i>

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.174
Oh, that's hard.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.376
<i> The most important learning--</i>

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:25.347
it's the ability to accept
and expect mistakes

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.649
and deal with the
disappointment that they bring.

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:29.451
Hi, neighbor.

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:32.854
Had a little trouble
with my zipper there.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:36.291
I'll get these shoes tied
and then...

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:38.360
Try the zipper again.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:41.029
<i> And Fred also understood</i>

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:44.800
<i> that there's a deeper level.</i>

01:01:44.802 --> 01:01:46.468
<i> You know something,</i>

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:48.837
-lady aberlin?
-What, Daniel?

01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:51.840
I've been wondering
about something myself.

01:01:51.842 --> 01:01:53.975
Something about Mr. skunk?

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:56.311
Something about mistakes.

01:01:56.313 --> 01:01:57.979
What is it?

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:02.884
I've been wondering
if I was a mistake.

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:05.821
<i> If you were a mistake?</i>

01:02:05.823 --> 01:02:07.889
And I will tell you,

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:12.661
sitting in the studio
listening to that, that day,

01:02:12.663 --> 01:02:14.996
I said to myself,

01:02:14.998 --> 01:02:18.266
"i can't believe Fred
had the courage

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:20.669
to put that into words."

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:25.841
Sometimes I wonder
if I'm too tame.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:58.206
You do?

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:06.314
<i> Lady aberlin</i>
<i> is saying to Daniel</i>

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:08.550
what Fred himself
wanted to say,

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:12.454
not only to his childhood self,
but to all children.

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:21.129
"Okay, then Daniel's
going to say,

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:23.131
'oh, thank you.
That helped me a lot.'"

01:03:32.075 --> 01:03:33.575
<i> and I thought to myself,</i>

01:03:33.577 --> 01:03:36.611
<i> "thank you, Fred,</i>
<i> for reminding us</i>

01:03:36.613 --> 01:03:41.516
<i> that it's not so easy</i>
<i> to quiet a doubt."</i>

01:03:41.518 --> 01:03:44.085
But make it a duet

01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:47.155
so that it's not just
your fears,

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.424
but you'll hear my support.

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:09.678
I think you are just fine

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.514
exactly the way you are.

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:13.815
The way I look?

01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:15.217
Yes.

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:16.685
The way I talk?

01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:18.320
Well, yes.

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:19.988
The way I love?

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.424
Especially that.

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:40.575
<i> There were black kids</i>
<i> watching the show.</i>

01:04:40.577 --> 01:04:44.246
<i> They needed a black figure</i>
<i> who would not let them down.</i>

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:46.314
<i> So, if I came out as gay</i>

01:04:46.316 --> 01:04:48.984
and there was some kind
of scandal,

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:52.020
that would not serve the race.

01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:54.656
I carried that all the time.

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:05.000
- Really nice, François.

01:05:05.002 --> 01:05:07.502
<i> I went to a gay bar</i>
<i> downtown called the play pen.</i>

01:05:07.504 --> 01:05:09.704
Oh, god, did I have
a lot of fun.

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:11.573
But somebody, uh, told the

01:05:11.575 --> 01:05:13.608
<i> mister Rogers' neighborhood</i>
people about it,

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.444
and he asked me, "did you...
Were you downtown at that bar?"

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:17.679
And I said, "yes."

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:20.348
He said, "you can't go
back there anymore."

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:22.584
I wanted to show this film
to you.

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:25.253
Okay, on picture picture.

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:29.357
<i> Here's Mrs. clemmons at home.</i>

01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:31.860
<i> In '68, I got married.</i>

01:05:31.862 --> 01:05:33.695
I'm not stupid.

01:05:33.697 --> 01:05:36.598
<i> There's the</i>
<i>portrait of the king and queen.</i>

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:41.102
If I came out publicly,
he said,

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:42.537
"you cannot be
on the show anymore."

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:46.274
<i> The sponsors,</i>
<i> Johnson & Johnson, and sears,</i>

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:50.645
<i> they are not going to support</i>
<i> an openly gay man.</i>

01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:55.884
<i> Fred was not prepared</i>
<i> to lose that market.</i>

01:05:55.886 --> 01:05:59.788
<i> My marriage failed miserably.</i>

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:02.891
And I discovered
you can't pray it away.

01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:07.829
<i> Eventually,</i>
<i> Fred came around to it.</i>

01:06:07.831 --> 01:06:09.464
<i> I think François</i>

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:13.501
just came a little too soon,
maybe, you know?

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:18.406
Oh, yes. Oh, my, yes.
Heavens.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:21.443
Um...

01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:24.279
You gotta forgive me for this,
but I have to ask you something

01:06:24.281 --> 01:06:26.915
that may sound impertinent,
and I don't mean for it to

01:06:26.917 --> 01:06:28.750
for a second.

01:06:28.752 --> 01:06:30.518
Are-are...

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.287
Are you square?

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:34.756
I mean, are you a straight guy?
I mean, you're just...

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:36.491
Are you really the way you are?

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:38.760
<i>First of all, no, he's not gay.</i>

01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:41.363
I tell everyone who asks me,
"no, he's not gay."

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:43.198
But the, uh...
The other part is--

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.767
I spent enough time with him
that if he had the...

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:50.338
If there was a gay vibe,
i would've picked it up.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:53.842
Nope, not as far as I know.

01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:57.278
I mean, I think that anybody
who looked at Fred

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.683
looked at somebody
that they couldn't compare

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:03.284
with anybody else.

01:07:03.286 --> 01:07:05.220
There's something inside you

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:07.022
that hasn't been lost.

01:07:07.024 --> 01:07:09.024
Thank you, Daniel.

01:07:09.026 --> 01:07:10.792
-Your childhood.
-Mm-hmm.

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:12.127
Okay.

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:13.294
I like him.

01:07:13.296 --> 01:07:15.063
I know.

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:16.297
-Bye.
-Bye-bye. Okay.

01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:17.966
<i> That was one of the things</i>

01:07:17.968 --> 01:07:19.868
<i> that I responded to.</i>

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:21.803
That's terrific.

01:07:21.805 --> 01:07:23.304
Wow.

01:07:23.306 --> 01:07:27.308
I definitely saw another way
of... of being a man.

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:31.413
<i> I'm sure you've heard</i>
<i> all these rumors</i>

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:35.350
about Fred being a Navy seal
and killing people.

01:07:35.352 --> 01:07:37.819
<i> Was Fred a Navy seal?</i>

01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:39.687
Did Fred have tattoos?

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:41.322
<i> And that, you know, he wore...</i>

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:42.924
<i> He wore the sweater</i>

01:07:42.926 --> 01:07:45.160
to cover the tattoos.

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:49.597
<i> Fred was born a rich kid.</i>

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:52.267
He didn't know how to use
a screwdriver,

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:54.369
let alone kill a bunch
of people.

01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:57.405
<i> That, to me, is just, like,</i>

01:07:57.407 --> 01:08:01.443
<i> a classic example</i>
<i> of people looking at Fred</i>

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:04.112
<i> in all his eccentricity</i>
<i> and singularity,</i>

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:07.916
<i> and trying to basically say,</i>
<i> "well, that can't be.</i>

01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:10.618
He has to be this way."

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.954
<i> The universal question</i>
<i> about Fred is--</i>

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:15.924
was he that way in real life?

01:08:15.926 --> 01:08:17.591
And the answer is yes.

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:21.863
François clemmons, hi.
Welcome.

01:08:21.865 --> 01:08:23.198
Thank you. How you doing?

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.732
-I'm fine. How are you today?
-Fine.

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:26.768
My feet were tired,
so I thought I'd just

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.803
soak them for a while
in this water.

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:31.238
-Does it make 'em feel better?
-It does.

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:32.774
-Would you like to try?
-Sure.

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:34.542
<i> On the show,</i>

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:37.645
<i> he would say, "i love you</i>
<i> just the way you are."</i>

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:39.214
<i> One day, I said,</i>

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:42.550
"Fred, were you talking to me?"

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.551
And he looked at me,
and he said,

01:08:44.554 --> 01:08:48.323
"yes, I've been talking
to you for two years,

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:51.759
and you finally
heard me today."

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:53.828
And I just collapsed
into his arms.

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:56.564
I was... I started crying. I...

01:08:56.566 --> 01:08:58.933
That's when I knew
that I loved him.

01:09:07.978 --> 01:09:10.011
<i> No man had ever told me</i>

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:11.412
<i> that he loved me like that.</i>

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:13.148
<i> I needed to hear it</i>
<i> all my life.</i>

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.415
<i> My dad never told me.</i>

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:17.452
<i> My step-father never told me.</i>

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:22.357
So, from then on,
he became my surrogate father.

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:25.960
I'm so proud of you, François.

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:27.428
Oh, thank you, Fred.

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.197
-Thank you.
-May I help you here?

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.698
Thank you.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.301
<i> The people who have had</i>

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:37.471
a lot of struggle
in their lives,

01:09:37.474 --> 01:09:40.375
<i> those are the people</i>
<i> who really impress me.</i>

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.348
There was an interview
with a little boy

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.450
by the name of Jeff erlanger.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:53.821
We wrote because Jeff was
going to have a spinal fusion

01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:56.791
and be in a...
What they call a halo, uh...

01:09:56.793 --> 01:09:59.527
-Cast. A halo cast.
-Metal rim, and then cast

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:02.297
on his shoulders
and bolted all together and...

01:10:02.299 --> 01:10:03.798
-All the way down his trunk.
-Yeah.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.700
<i> We weren't sure... </i>
-Howard: <i> He may not have</i>

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:08.136
<i> survived the surgery,</i>
<i> and so we said, you know,</i>

01:10:08.138 --> 01:10:09.704
"what would you like to do?

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:12.307
"Uh, this is going to be
a really big task for you,

01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:14.342
"and so we want
to kick it off with something

01:10:14.344 --> 01:10:16.177
that would be really special."

01:10:16.179 --> 01:10:18.046
Mr. Rogers?

01:10:18.048 --> 01:10:20.181
Hey, Jeff.

01:10:20.183 --> 01:10:22.483
-I'm glad to see you.
-Hi.

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:25.220
Thank you very much
for coming by.

01:10:25.222 --> 01:10:28.323
Can you tell my friends
what it is

01:10:28.325 --> 01:10:30.825
that made you need
this wheelchair?

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:31.926
Sure.

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:37.665
Well, when I was about
seven months old,

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:40.235
I had, um...

01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:43.104
I had a tumor,

01:10:43.106 --> 01:10:45.506
and it broke the nerves

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:48.176
to tell my hands
and legs what to do.

01:10:48.178 --> 01:10:50.245
I see.

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:54.549
And I got a wheelchair

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:56.517
when I was four years old.

01:10:56.519 --> 01:10:58.453
-That was your first one?
-Mm-hmm.

01:10:58.455 --> 01:11:00.188
-When you were four.
-Uh-huh.

01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:02.924
<i> He told Jeff before</i>
<i> they started that they would</i>

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:04.692
have a chat and then sing
a song together.

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:06.361
I think he said,
"we might sing a song."

01:11:06.363 --> 01:11:07.629
-I remember.
-Yeah.

01:11:07.631 --> 01:11:09.530
'Cause, I mean,
i was sort of surprised.

01:11:09.532 --> 01:11:11.399
"What? He's going
to start singing a song?"

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:12.800
Well, you know,
this is totally...

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:14.135
Not even what song.

01:12:30.447 --> 01:12:32.947
-And it is you I like, Jeff.
-Thanks.

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:35.316
And there must be times
when you do feel blue.

01:12:35.318 --> 01:12:36.684
Uh-huh.

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.320
I'm not feeling blue
right now, though.

01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:40.688
- Me, neither.

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:43.958
I'm so glad
that you came today.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.226
Thanks.

01:12:45.228 --> 01:12:46.461
I remember asking one of the...

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.196
One of the staff people
that was there,

01:12:48.198 --> 01:12:49.831
"well, you know,
what do you think?

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:50.832
Did it go okay?"

01:12:50.834 --> 01:12:52.700
"Oh, this is good.
This is good."

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:55.169
<i> He had his surgery.</i>

01:12:55.171 --> 01:12:56.804
<i> He survived.</i>

01:12:56.806 --> 01:13:01.376
<i> Certainly, Mr. Rogers had</i>
<i> an impact on who Jeff became.</i>

01:13:01.378 --> 01:13:03.644
His sense of self.

01:13:03.646 --> 01:13:07.915
<i>You obviously have a power now.</i>

01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:09.584
I mean, that you wouldn't
have had

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:12.120
when you first
started the show.

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:17.525
Well, it might sound
very ingenuous,

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:19.994
but I don't feel that.

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:27.068
<i> Behold.</i>
<i> These shall be your minions.</i>

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:29.670
<i> I would hope that anybody</i>

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:32.673
<i>who sets himself or herself out</i>

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:36.911
<i> to produce mass programming</i>
<i> for children...</i>

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:41.349
...could have the kind
of respect

01:13:41.351 --> 01:13:43.117
of childhood that I have.

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:51.759
<i> Because it's not all clowns</i>
<i> and balloons.</i>

01:14:00.969 --> 01:14:03.371
What do you mean,
you don't agree with me?!

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:09.777
Some television programs
are loud and scary,

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:12.980
with people shooting
and hitting other people.

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:16.384
You know, you can do
something about that.

01:14:16.386 --> 01:14:21.122
When you see scary television,
you can turn it off.

01:14:23.225 --> 01:14:25.259
<i> We need to help our children</i>

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:27.895
become more and more aware

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:31.732
that what is essential in life

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:35.436
is invisible to the eye.

01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:37.238
Thank you.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.674
Thank you very much.

01:14:39.676 --> 01:14:42.410
<i> As he got older, it was</i>

01:14:42.412 --> 01:14:46.314
<i> more important for him</i>
<i> to be strong in his beliefs.</i>

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:49.584
<i> Maybe that was how</i>
<i> he was getting his anger out.</i>

01:14:49.586 --> 01:14:51.452
<i> His anger that people</i>

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:52.620
didn't take him seriously.

01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:53.921
They didn't get him.

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:56.691
They didn't get
the depth of the show.

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:03.297
<i> He started out being Daniel,</i>

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:06.834
<i> soft and quiet and shy;</i>

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:10.505
developed into king Friday.

01:15:10.507 --> 01:15:12.540
That is not correct.

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:15.610
Now do it again
and do it perfectly.

01:15:15.612 --> 01:15:16.944
<i> Wasn't king Friday</i>

01:15:16.946 --> 01:15:19.146
<i> a wonderful insight</i>
<i> into his character?</i>

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:20.348
<i> His determination</i>

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:22.049
and his ambitions.

01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:27.188
As a king, I must see
that the world runs smoothly.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:28.789
Farewell to you both.

01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:30.625
<i> That gruffness was his way</i>

01:15:30.627 --> 01:15:33.794
<i> of getting what he wanted</i>
<i> across.</i>

01:15:33.796 --> 01:15:37.298
<i> Fred Rogers wanted something</i>
<i> very badly</i>

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.134
and would do what he felt
was necessary

01:15:40.136 --> 01:15:41.869
in order to get it.

01:15:46.508 --> 01:15:49.744
<i> Let's take the gauntlet</i>

01:15:49.746 --> 01:15:52.713
<i> and make goodness attractive</i>

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:56.050
<i> in this so-called</i>
<i> next millennium.</i>

01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:59.620
That's the real...

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:04.825
That's the real job
that we have.

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:07.695
I'm not talking about
pollyanna-ish kind of stuff.

01:16:07.697 --> 01:16:11.065
I'm talking about
down-to-earth,

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:13.901
actual goodness.

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:16.837
People caring for each other

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:19.840
in a myriad of ways,

01:16:19.842 --> 01:16:22.843
rather than people knocking
each other off all the time.

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:26.681
I mean, I don't find that
funny at all.

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:30.184
<i> What changes the world?</i>

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:35.423
<i> The only thing that ever</i>
<i> really changes the world</i>

01:16:35.425 --> 01:16:38.559
<i> is when somebody gets the idea</i>

01:16:38.561 --> 01:16:42.396
that love can abound

01:16:42.398 --> 01:16:44.999
<i> and can be shared.</i>

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:50.304
You're doing a great job.

01:16:57.045 --> 01:16:59.213
<i> Dad never stood up and said,</i>

01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:01.215
<i> "look at what I've done.</i>
<i> Look at this.</i>

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:02.883
<i> Isn't this wonderful?"</i>

01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:06.487
<i> The only time I ever saw him</i>
<i> come even close</i>

01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:08.756
to anything like that
was when he did the interview

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:10.358
with koko the gorilla.

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:16.230
Great.

01:17:16.232 --> 01:17:17.431
That's a happy sound.

01:17:17.433 --> 01:17:18.499
Is it?

01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:19.634
That's a purr.

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:21.469
Like that?

01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:23.604
Can you teach me
how to do that?

01:17:26.342 --> 01:17:28.676
Isn't that a nice way
to welcome someone

01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:30.978
and say that you're happy?

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:35.650
<i> It's... it was</i>
<i> a weird kind of a...</i>

01:17:35.652 --> 01:17:37.618
<i> Kind of a thing, but, uh...</i>

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:42.323
You realize there was something
kind of magical going on there.

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:44.759
What? Love?

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:46.761
"Love you," she said.

01:17:46.763 --> 01:17:49.096
-Oh, is that...? Oh.
-"Love you. Visit. Love."

01:17:49.098 --> 01:17:51.332
-Oh.
-Well, that was very nice.

01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:52.867
Thank you, koko.

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:08.015
There's so much
to think about, isn't there?

01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:11.786
<i> Let me ask you</i>
<i> something about what we've</i>

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:14.155
<i> -been discussing for the last</i>
<i> three hours.</i> -Woman: <i> Yeah.</i>

01:18:14.157 --> 01:18:15.790
-Yeah. -Mr. Rogers
and the narcissistic society

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:17.158
that he gave birth to

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.994
<i> because he told every kid</i>
<i> that they were important.</i>

01:18:19.996 --> 01:18:23.130
<i> Do you believe his philosophy</i>
<i> destroyed a generation?</i>

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:26.467
<i> This evil, evil man.</i>

01:18:26.469 --> 01:18:28.502
The criticism goes like this:

01:18:28.504 --> 01:18:30.371
"You told everyone
they're special.

01:18:30.373 --> 01:18:33.641
"They don't have to do anything
to earn that special.

01:18:33.643 --> 01:18:35.576
"That's what's wrong
with our country.

01:18:35.578 --> 01:18:37.645
That's what's wrong with
children today."

01:18:37.647 --> 01:18:40.047
<i> He didn't say,</i>
<i> "if you want to be special,</i>

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.682
<i> you're gonna have</i>
<i> to work hard."</i>

01:18:41.684 --> 01:18:43.250
<i> And now all these kids</i>
<i> are growing up,</i>

01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:45.186
<i> and they're realizing,</i>
<i> "hey, wait a minute.</i>

01:18:45.188 --> 01:18:48.255
<i> Mr. Rogers lied to me.</i>
<i> I'm not special."</i>

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:51.492
<i> I'm sure by then Fred</i>
<i> had heard the criticisms,</i>

01:18:51.494 --> 01:18:55.596
<i> but he's not talking</i>
<i> about entitlement.</i>

01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:57.364
<i> And if you don't believe</i>

01:18:57.366 --> 01:19:00.868
that everyone
has inherent value,

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:03.437
you might as well go against

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:06.006
<i> the fundamental notion</i>
<i> of christianity</i>

01:19:06.008 --> 01:19:12.580
<i> that you are the beloved son</i>
<i> or daughter of god.</i>

01:19:12.582 --> 01:19:13.681
-Hi, Mr. Rogers.
-Hi.

01:19:13.683 --> 01:19:14.949
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:16.584
I'm glad to meet you.
Thank you.

01:19:16.586 --> 01:19:18.185
I watched your show
as a youngster.

01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:19.854
I wasn't allowed to go
to preschool

01:19:19.856 --> 01:19:21.388
'cause I had a disability,

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:23.691
and my mom made me
watch your show every day.

01:19:23.693 --> 01:19:24.959
So thank you.

01:19:24.961 --> 01:19:26.393
Bless your heart,
and here you are.

01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:28.896
Thank you for
my preschool education.

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:31.365
And thank you
for inspiring me today.

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:34.201
<i> At the very end of Fred's</i>

01:19:34.203 --> 01:19:37.304
<i> very last commencement speech,</i>
<i> he said</i>

01:19:37.306 --> 01:19:40.474
what he meant when he'd say,
"you're special."

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:44.879
And what that ultimately means,
of course,

01:19:44.881 --> 01:19:48.382
is that you don't ever
have to do

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:51.652
anything sensational

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:53.888
for people to love you.

01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:56.991
<i> It is really a matter</i>

01:19:56.993 --> 01:19:58.893
of believing that

01:19:58.895 --> 01:20:03.063
you're endowed
by your creator with good.

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:06.967
You know,
there are many different ways

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:08.235
of saying, "i love you."

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:10.905
In fact, I like
to think about times

01:20:10.907 --> 01:20:12.673
when I've seen people
showing their love.

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:14.742
- Okay.

01:20:14.744 --> 01:20:16.577
Mm-hmm.

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:18.078
Show 1765.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.680
This is the last scene

01:20:19.682 --> 01:20:22.283
of the last show
of the last day,

01:20:22.285 --> 01:20:25.486
the last taping day
of the interior

01:20:25.488 --> 01:20:27.121
of <i> mister Rogers' neighborhood.</i>

01:20:51.647 --> 01:20:53.347
This place has been condemned.

01:20:53.349 --> 01:20:55.049
Oh, it's been condemned.
Oh, well.

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:58.853
-You got two days to move out.
-Okay, thanks. See you.

01:21:01.324 --> 01:21:03.891
That was wonderful.

01:21:03.893 --> 01:21:06.126
<i> Years ago, it wasn't so weird</i>

01:21:06.128 --> 01:21:10.965
that... that somebody
as nice as Fred was around.

01:21:10.967 --> 01:21:15.202
Now there-there isn't room
for a nice person on TV.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:18.305
So, we must have, uh,
regular reunions.

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:19.473
Yeah.

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:20.908
How about Tuesday?

01:21:22.912 --> 01:21:24.378
Yeah, I'll have forgotten by...

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.313
About everyone by Monday,
so Tuesday will...

01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:28.682
-Tuesday will bring it
all back. -Bring it all back.

01:21:58.014 --> 01:21:59.780
- We did it.
- We did it.

01:21:59.782 --> 01:22:01.181
-Can you believe it?
-We did it!

01:22:01.183 --> 01:22:04.518
Ooh, mercy.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.755
<i> When he did stop</i>
<i> making the programs,</i>

01:22:07.757 --> 01:22:11.458
<i> I felt that he was depressed.</i>

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:14.862
<i> I mentioned it to him,</i>

01:22:14.864 --> 01:22:17.598
and he said,

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.635
"well, I miss my playmates."

01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:30.644
Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:31.946
That's fine.

01:22:31.948 --> 01:22:34.415
Okay. Okay, slate out.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.450
<i> We decided to have Fred back</i>

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:40.120
<i> to do some promos about 9/11.</i>

01:22:42.157 --> 01:22:44.558
<i> He was very troubled,</i>
<i> and I said,</i>

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.660
<i> "Fred, what's wrong?"</i>
<i> And he said,</i>

01:22:46.662 --> 01:22:51.098
"i just don't know what good
these are gonna do."

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:54.335
<i> And I just remember saying,</i>

01:22:54.337 --> 01:22:56.904
<i> "Fred, how can you say that?"</i>

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:07.081
<i> When the horror of 9/11</i>
<i> really hit him,</i>

01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:10.818
<i> i-i think it was</i>
<i> a real eye-opener.</i>

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.754
<i> He was realizing that...</i>

01:23:13.756 --> 01:23:16.123
<i> It was just so big.</i>

01:23:16.125 --> 01:23:20.294
<i> It's always going to be</i>
<i> an ongoing struggle</i>

01:23:20.296 --> 01:23:23.263
<i> to overcome evil.</i>

01:23:23.265 --> 01:23:26.200
<i> I remember thinking, "okay,</i>

01:23:26.202 --> 01:23:29.670
"this is the time
that you need to pump him up

01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:32.272
"because he doesn't understand

01:23:32.274 --> 01:23:34.775
"this... this is really
important.

01:23:34.777 --> 01:23:36.677
People listen to you."

01:23:37.779 --> 01:23:39.513
Okay.

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:46.954
No matter what
our particular job,

01:23:46.956 --> 01:23:50.290
especially in our world today,

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:56.063
we all are called
to be <i> tikkun olam,</i>

01:23:56.065 --> 01:24:00.501
"repairers of creation."

01:24:00.503 --> 01:24:04.972
Thank you for whatever you do,
wherever you are,

01:24:04.974 --> 01:24:07.975
to bring joy and light

01:24:07.977 --> 01:24:09.810
and hope and faith

01:24:09.812 --> 01:24:12.980
and pardon and love

01:24:12.982 --> 01:24:16.817
to your neighbor
and to yourself.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:38.672
<i> Fred didn't like going</i>
<i> to the doctor's office.</i>

01:24:38.674 --> 01:24:41.875
He had stomach problems
for a long time.

01:24:41.877 --> 01:24:43.444
I mean, for several years.

01:24:43.446 --> 01:24:47.581
Oh, what's that
right down there?

01:24:49.518 --> 01:24:51.185
Take a look at the aquarium.

01:24:51.187 --> 01:24:53.520
Do you see a dead fish?

01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:57.224
A dead fish would be one
that isn't swimming

01:24:57.226 --> 01:24:59.893
or breathing
or anything at all.

01:24:59.895 --> 01:25:01.695
Look down there and see,
will you?

01:25:01.697 --> 01:25:03.797
See if you see any.

01:25:03.799 --> 01:25:05.866
Oh, yes, right there, isn't it?

01:25:05.868 --> 01:25:08.368
<i> He told me that he was sick.</i>

01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:11.371
<i> I played a bach sarabande</i>
<i> for him over the phone.</i>

01:25:11.373 --> 01:25:15.676
It's like sending
a little loving message.

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:26.153
<i> When he was very ill,</i>

01:25:26.155 --> 01:25:30.891
<i> he talked a lot</i>
<i> about dying well.</i>

01:25:30.893 --> 01:25:35.395
To die with the hopes in...

01:25:35.397 --> 01:25:38.132
With the hopes intact.

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:46.273
<i> Before he became comatose,</i>
<i> he said,</i>

01:25:46.275 --> 01:25:49.143
"do you think I'm a sheep?"

01:25:49.145 --> 01:25:51.345
And we knew what he
was talking about

01:25:51.347 --> 01:25:54.014
because he had been reading
in the Bible

01:25:54.016 --> 01:25:58.152
<i> about the last days,</i>
<i> with the... with the judgment.</i>

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:03.257
<i> It will be decided at the end</i>

01:26:03.259 --> 01:26:06.527
<i> who is a sheep</i>
<i> and who is a goat.</i>

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:12.766
<i> And I think the need was</i>
<i> always there for being loved,</i>

01:26:12.768 --> 01:26:16.670
<i> for being capable</i>
<i> of being loved.</i>

01:26:18.439 --> 01:26:19.940
There was a...
A little silence,

01:26:19.942 --> 01:26:22.109
and then I said, "Fred,

01:26:22.111 --> 01:26:24.978
if ever there was a sheep,
you're one."

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:47.301
Well, I suppose
it's an invitation,

01:26:47.303 --> 01:26:49.870
"won't you be my neighbor?"

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:54.408
Uh, it's an invitation for...

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:57.711
Uh, somebody
to be close to you.

01:26:57.713 --> 01:27:03.383
You know, I think everybody
longs to be loved

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:09.022
and longs to know
that he or she is lovable.

01:27:10.826 --> 01:27:15.495
<i> And consequently, the greatest</i>
<i> thing that we can do</i>

01:27:15.497 --> 01:27:18.699
<i> is to help somebody know</i>

01:27:18.701 --> 01:27:22.903
<i> that they're loved</i>
<i> and capable of loving.</i>

01:27:42.023 --> 01:27:43.857
<i> Across the street</i>
<i> from Fred's funeral,</i>

01:27:43.859 --> 01:27:46.760
<i> there's this hubbub,</i>
<i> and there's all these people</i>

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:50.230
<i> holding up signs saying,</i>
<i> "god hates fags."</i>

01:27:50.232 --> 01:27:51.865
And I went and talked to them

01:27:51.867 --> 01:27:54.635
because Fred would have it
no other way.

01:27:54.637 --> 01:27:56.737
<i> I said,</i>
<i> "are you condemning Fred?</i>

01:27:56.739 --> 01:27:58.538
<i> "Are you saying</i>
<i> that he was gay?</i>

01:27:58.540 --> 01:27:59.940
<i>Wh-what's... what's happening?"</i>

01:27:59.942 --> 01:28:02.309
<i> And they were saying that,</i>
<i> "no, no, he just...</i>

01:28:02.311 --> 01:28:04.211
<i> He-he tolerated gays."</i>

01:28:04.213 --> 01:28:08.982
And so they were... they were
intolerant of the tolerance.

01:28:08.984 --> 01:28:12.119
And the thing that... the thing
that struck me that day,

01:28:12.121 --> 01:28:14.221
uh, more than anything else

01:28:14.223 --> 01:28:15.989
was the children
that were there.

01:28:15.991 --> 01:28:20.060
<i> Children that had been drafted</i>
<i> into doing this work,</i>

01:28:20.062 --> 01:28:22.329
<i> into standing there</i>
<i> with their parents</i>

01:28:22.331 --> 01:28:24.798
<i> and holding up signs</i>
<i> and screaming.</i>

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:29.670
And those kids
looked so unhappy.

01:28:29.672 --> 01:28:33.140
Those kids looked so exhausted.

01:28:33.142 --> 01:28:35.409
Those kids looked
so ill-treated.

01:28:35.411 --> 01:28:37.144
It was just heart-breaking.

01:28:37.146 --> 01:28:40.314
And I... and I knew
that if Fred had seen that,

01:28:40.316 --> 01:28:42.683
that that's where his heart
would have gone.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.768
<i>I can't think how he would feel</i>

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:05.605
<i> about the things</i>
<i> that have come out</i>

01:29:05.607 --> 01:29:10.777
<i> that seem to set us back</i>
<i> so far.</i>

01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:13.480
<i> And I wonder</i>
<i> if he wouldn't simply</i>

01:29:13.482 --> 01:29:16.350
<i> put down his tiger</i>
<i> and just stay home,</i>

01:29:16.352 --> 01:29:19.119
<i> forget about even trying.</i>

01:29:19.121 --> 01:29:22.322
<i> He's not a person</i>
<i> who would have given up,</i>

01:29:22.324 --> 01:29:24.458
but this is daunting.

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:30.330
I... I think he would be
trying to mend...

01:29:30.332 --> 01:29:32.599
Mend the...

01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:36.903
...the split.

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:43.477
<i> He would be trying</i>
<i> to find some way</i>

01:29:43.479 --> 01:29:46.513
<i> to find something positive.</i>

01:29:46.515 --> 01:29:48.382
<i> When I was a boy</i>

01:29:48.384 --> 01:29:50.650
<i> and I would hear</i>
<i> about something scary,</i>

01:29:50.652 --> 01:29:52.252
<i> my mother would tell us,</i>

01:29:52.254 --> 01:29:54.821
<i> "always look for the people</i>
<i> who are helping.</i>

01:29:54.823 --> 01:29:59.826
<i> You'll always find somebody</i>
<i> who's trying to help."</i>

01:29:59.828 --> 01:30:01.528
I think there are
a lot of people

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:03.430
out there like Fred Rogers.

01:30:03.432 --> 01:30:06.466
A lot more than we really
want to believe.

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:10.670
<i> In response to the question,</i>

01:30:10.672 --> 01:30:13.173
<i> "what would Fred Rogers do?"</i>

01:30:13.175 --> 01:30:16.910
<i> It's not a question</i>
<i> that you can answer.</i>

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:20.680
The most important question is:

01:30:20.682 --> 01:30:23.016
"What are you going to do?"

01:30:23.018 --> 01:30:26.052
From the time
you were very little,

01:30:26.054 --> 01:30:31.425
you've had people who have
smiled you into smiling,

01:30:31.427 --> 01:30:35.729
people who have talked you
into talking,

01:30:35.731 --> 01:30:39.366
sung you into singing,

01:30:39.368 --> 01:30:41.868
loved you into loving.

01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:45.205
<i> When he was</i>
<i> giving speeches, he would say,</i>

01:30:45.207 --> 01:30:49.976
"now, think about somebody
who's helped you along the way

01:30:49.978 --> 01:30:52.145
<i> "for one minute.</i>

01:30:52.147 --> 01:30:55.048
<i> I'm going to time you."</i>

01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:57.717
<i> Let's just take some time</i>

01:30:57.719 --> 01:31:01.788
<i> to think of those</i>
<i> extra special people.</i>

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:06.159
Hmm.

01:31:06.161 --> 01:31:10.130
<i>Some of them may be right here.</i>

01:31:10.132 --> 01:31:13.400
<i> Some may be far away.</i>

01:31:13.402 --> 01:31:16.736
<i> Some may even be in heaven.</i>

01:31:16.738 --> 01:31:18.972
<i> No matter where they are,</i>

01:31:18.974 --> 01:31:22.442
<i> deep down,</i>
<i> you know they've always wanted</i>

01:31:22.444 --> 01:31:25.011
<i> what was best for you.</i>

01:31:25.013 --> 01:31:29.816
<i> They've always cared about you</i>
<i> beyond measure</i>

01:31:29.818 --> 01:31:33.153
<i> and have encouraged you</i>
<i> to be true</i>

01:31:33.155 --> 01:31:35.555
<i> to the best within you.</i>

01:31:47.935 --> 01:31:49.102
Thank you.

01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:52.038
My mother.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:53.707
How I got to this point,

01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:56.510
because it was
my grandfather's doing.

01:31:56.512 --> 01:31:58.979
There was this woman
named viola

01:31:58.981 --> 01:32:01.281
who used to take care of me
when I was little.

01:32:01.283 --> 01:32:02.916
She was our babysitter.

01:32:03.784 --> 01:32:06.019
I thought about Fred.

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:08.021
How about you?

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:10.590
Yeah.

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:13.026
Mm.

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.741
Thank you.

01:32:59.841 --> 01:33:02.375

01:33:12.354 --> 01:33:14.287
-Thank you. You, too.
-Oh!

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:17.591
What a surprise.
