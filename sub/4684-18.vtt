WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:04.966
No, no, no.
Don't touch that dial.

00:05.033 --> 00:07.866
Here's what's on
my mind tonight.

00:10.033 --> 00:12.533
Emma's new home
has a lurid past.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.366
That 80 years ago,
some guy killed his wife here.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.600
And he slit her throat
from ear to ear.

00:17.666 --> 00:19.933
But then, so does Emma.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.733
Imagine driving a man
that crazy.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.766
Are there ghosts in her house?

00:23.833 --> 00:24.866
Does she have skeletons

00:24.933 --> 00:26.866
in her closet?

00:26.933 --> 00:28.033
Find out..

00:28.100 --> 00:29.300
Emma's got a&lt;

00:29.366 --> 00:31.233
distorted view of the world.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.633
...on the next
"Freddy's Nightmares."

00:55.166 --> 00:57.433
You're in Springwood now

00:57.500 --> 00:59.600
and you're all mine.

01:03.066 --> 01:04.800
No!

01:27.566 --> 01:29.100
Haunted? Give me a break.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.433
'I'm not kidding you, lady.'

01:30.500 --> 01:32.433
'This place is famous for it.'

01:35.366 --> 01:37.700
I wouldn't kid about
a thing like that.

01:37.766 --> 01:40.733
That 80 years ago some guy
killed his wife here.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.400
Oh, and that makes it haunted?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.533
All I know is what I hear.

01:47.666 --> 01:49.233
Well, yeah, and?

01:49.300 --> 01:51.233
Oh, you're interested?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.966
Well..

01:55.033 --> 01:57.600
...the way I heard it..

01:57.666 --> 01:59.266
Now, this guy
is a real jealous type

01:59.333 --> 02:00.400
you know what I mean?

02:00.466 --> 02:02.700
Cut to the chase.

02:02.766 --> 02:05.400
This guy is sure his wife
is messing around on him

02:05.466 --> 02:07.633
but he can't catch her.

02:07.700 --> 02:11.066
So one day, when he's supposed
to be outta town

02:11.133 --> 02:12.433
he shows up.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.800
And what do you know?

02:15.866 --> 02:18.400
There she is in the bed
with another guy.

02:18.466 --> 02:19.733
Let me guess.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.266
He kills them both
and their spirits

02:21.333 --> 02:23.300
have been haunting the house
ever since.

02:23.366 --> 02:25.633
Well, I don't know
what happened to the other guy

02:25.700 --> 02:27.566
but I know this.

02:27.633 --> 02:30.633
The husband chases her
into the study..

02:31.400 --> 02:33.466
...and he caught her.

02:33.533 --> 02:36.200
And he slit her throat
from ear to ear.

02:38.266 --> 02:40.200
Imagine driving a man
that crazy.

02:41.566 --> 02:42.533
'What did you say
your name was?'

02:42.600 --> 02:44.566
'Uh, Jillian, sir.'

02:44.633 --> 02:46.633
Emma, this is Jillian.

02:47.566 --> 02:49.500
Uh, the maid.

02:49.566 --> 02:51.166
I didn't hire a maid.

02:51.233 --> 02:53.433
No, you didn't, apparently
she comes with the place.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.933
Well, this house
is full of surprises.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.166
The moving man was just
telling me that it's haunted.

02:57.233 --> 02:59.666
I guess that figures, I mean

02:59.733 --> 03:01.633
'considering what
we pay in rent'

03:01.700 --> 03:04.033
'we should have expected
a few extras.'

03:04.100 --> 03:05.900
You know, I'm getting to
like this place more and more.

03:05.966 --> 03:09.000
It's got character,
it's got history.

03:09.066 --> 03:10.533
Ghosts.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.033
Shall I begin unpacking
in the kitchen, ma'am?

03:13.100 --> 03:15.033
The kitchen. Yes, please.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.600
Nice guy.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.433
Well...I'm done.

03:28.133 --> 03:30.000
You know, you and I should talk.

03:30.066 --> 03:31.566
Oh, yeah?

03:31.633 --> 03:32.833
Well...

03:32.900 --> 03:35.333
...I mean, here you are,
new in town.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.833
Here I am, a native.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.566
I could show you around.

03:40.633 --> 03:42.666
I'll bet you could.

03:42.733 --> 03:44.233
Of course,
the fact that I'm married

03:44.300 --> 03:47.033
means absolutely nothing
to you.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.433
I never let details
get in the way of a little fun.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.333
Maybe some other time.

04:22.733 --> 04:27.100
My pal, Emma's got a
distorted view of the world.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.300
She's about to wind up
in a prison..

04:33.366 --> 04:35.266
...of her own making.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.633
Is it my imagination
or was that moving man

04:37.700 --> 04:38.900
hitting on you?

04:38.966 --> 04:40.866
What makes you think
every guy is hitting on me

04:40.933 --> 04:42.200
Experience.

04:47.033 --> 04:49.300
Think they're
the haunted couple?

04:49.366 --> 04:51.433
Sometimes I think&nbsp;
we'rethe haunted couple.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.900
- Robert..
- Hmm?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.133
- You shouldn't have.
- I didn't.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.133
Well, then, who did?

05:06.266 --> 05:09.333
It's an anniversary presen
from Colin.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.100
'He says, "If this
doesn't keep you together'

05:11.166 --> 05:12.500
'then nothing will."'

05:18.433 --> 05:21.633
His and hers handcuffs.

05:21.700 --> 05:24.033
That ex-husband of yours
is one sick puppy.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.200
Yeah, well,
he wasyour&lt;row1

05:28.000 --> 05:29.500
Do you think this means
he's forgiven us?

05:29.566 --> 05:31.533
I'd hate to think what it means.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.100
I thought you might need this.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.133
The study's always
a little chilly.

05:38.133 --> 05:40.100
Thank you, Jillian.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.300
Not that a space heater
isn't romantic.

05:42.366 --> 05:43.500
I just wish we'd been told

05:43.566 --> 05:45.333
they were gonna
brick up the flue..

05:45.400 --> 05:47.500
Jillian, a-about your boss..

05:47.566 --> 05:49.300
Actually, I've never met him.

05:49.366 --> 05:51.233
He was a friend of my father's.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.066
All I know is
he lives somewhere in Europe

05:53.133 --> 05:55.233
and I'm paid on the tenth
of each month.

05:55.300 --> 05:56.866
Uh, shall I serve dinner now?

05:56.933 --> 05:58.433
Actually, uh..

05:58.500 --> 06:01.333
Emma and I were thinkin'
of giving you the night off.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.300
So we could have
the house to ourselves.

06:03.366 --> 06:05.333
That's very kind. Thank you.

06:08.533 --> 06:10.666
Europe, huh?

06:10.733 --> 06:12.533
Well, look at it this way.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.633
He'll never call us and tell us
to turn down our music.

06:18.833 --> 06:19.900
You've gotta work on this

06:19.966 --> 06:23.133
suspicious side of yours.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.700
Maybe a little
physical therapy'll help.

06:25.766 --> 06:27.700
I'm willing to look into it.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.933
Let's go break in the bed.

06:32.733 --> 06:35.333
Ah, we can't forget
our new..

06:36.166 --> 06:38.133
...play things.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.033
I'll go warm up the sheets

07:13.033 --> 07:14.900
Robert!

07:16.033 --> 07:16.966
- What's the matter?
- The painting.

07:17.033 --> 07:19.000
The woman, she's bleeding.

07:40.533 --> 07:42.533
I won't let you
get away from me again, Emma.

07:43.266 --> 07:45.700
No, Collin. It's over.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.500
Robert! Robert!

07:49.566 --> 07:51.833
He can't help you.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.100
He betrayed my friendship
and you betrayed my love.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.266
But I'm willing to give yo
another chance.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.900
All you have to do
is let me love you.

07:57.966 --> 07:58.900
No, Collin.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.600
You're here for a little fun?

08:10.466 --> 08:12.233
Are you alright?

08:12.300 --> 08:13.533
Where's my husband?

08:13.600 --> 08:14.933
He left early this morning

08:15.000 --> 08:16.766
He said he wanted to buy
a new lighting fixture

08:16.833 --> 08:18.833
to replace the chandelier.

08:33.366 --> 08:34.633
Jillian!

08:51.766 --> 08:54.000
Collin?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.366
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to say hello.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.300
That's not a crime, is it?

09:00.366 --> 09:01.866
Well, it's nice to see
you haven't lost your

09:01.933 --> 09:04.400
defensive tendencies,
I'm just surprised to see you.

09:04.466 --> 09:05.600
It's been a long time.

09:05.666 --> 09:07.766
On Thursday, it'll be a year.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.000
I-I..

09:09.066 --> 09:11.000
I wanted to see your house.
I wanted to talk.

09:11.066 --> 09:12.500
I'm not here
to make you feel guilty.

09:12.566 --> 09:14.533
The hell you're not.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.266
Very nice.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.433
Looks like the kind of place
you always dreamed of.

09:20.833 --> 09:22.633
Did you get my gift?

09:22.700 --> 09:24.933
Oh, yes. Very imaginative.
Thank you.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.333
How's Robert?

09:28.400 --> 09:31.533
No, I-I-I don't wanna know.
I don't care how he is, uh..

09:31.600 --> 09:33.266
'He wasn't much of a friend.'

09:33.333 --> 09:36.266
I'll be honest,
I-I came here to tell you

09:36.333 --> 09:37.466
that I still love you.

09:37.533 --> 09:38.700
I-I want us
to get back together.

09:38.766 --> 09:40.600
I'll make everything right.
I swear it!

09:40.666 --> 09:42.433
What're you gonna do?

09:42.500 --> 09:44.333
You gonna love me some more?

09:44.400 --> 09:45.833
I don't want your love.

09:45.900 --> 09:48.566
Why won't you let me in,
what are you afraid of?

09:48.633 --> 09:50.600
Let me love you.
I can make you so happy.

09:50.666 --> 09:51.733
Okay, I think you should go now.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.133
- No.
- No, I want you to go.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.200
Emma!

09:56.000 --> 09:57.633
I do not want you to call me!

09:57.700 --> 09:59.566
'I do not want you
to visit me..'

09:59.633 --> 10:02.500
and I especially
do not want you to love me!

10:08.400 --> 10:09.833
The backdoor was open.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.433
Not a good idea.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.600
One of your boxes
was left in my truck.

10:16.066 --> 10:17.900
Uh-huh.

10:17.966 --> 10:20.100
Look, maybe
you misunderstood me.

10:20.166 --> 10:21.666
I'm not interested.

10:21.733 --> 10:23.700
No, I understood you just fine.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.133
I told you I'm married.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.800
Yeah, well..

10:30.700 --> 10:32.733
I heard what you told that guy.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.766
'Springwood PD.'

10:42.833 --> 10:45.200
Yes, I would like to report
a break in.

10:45.266 --> 10:47.300
'Your name and address, ma'am?'

10:47.366 --> 10:49.100
I know exactly what you're like.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.166
'Hello?'

10:50.233 --> 10:51.166
You've never been faithful

10:51.233 --> 10:52.900
to anyone in your whole life.

10:52.966 --> 10:54.900
- 'Are you alright, ma'am?'
- Hey, you're just like me.

10:56.133 --> 10:59.066
Well, I'm the man
of your dreams, honey.

10:59.133 --> 11:00.900
I know more about you..

11:02.433 --> 11:04.400
...than you know yourself.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.000
I know what you're thinking.

11:09.066 --> 11:11.133
Is he really as good
as he thinks he is?

12:13.166 --> 12:15.733
I want you to watch me
take off my clothes.

12:17.733 --> 12:19.500
But I wanna be sure..

12:19.566 --> 12:21.533
...you can't touch.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.733
Okay, Houdini,
how are you doing it?

12:43.400 --> 12:44.500
Doin' what?

12:44.566 --> 12:46.333
How did you make
the chandelier fall?

12:46.400 --> 12:48.300
And the painting bleed?

12:49.566 --> 12:50.900
Look, I don't know
what you're talkin' about

12:50.966 --> 12:52.566
but if you're not
gonna take your clothes off

12:52.633 --> 12:54.633
you better take these cuffs off.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.300
Hey, what the hell's
goin' on in here?

12:57.366 --> 12:58.900
Hey, hey, look, all I'm doin'

12:58.966 --> 13:00.333
is bringin' back
one of your boxes.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.466
Yeah, with your pants
half open?

13:02.533 --> 13:04.500
Well, you better ask her
about that.

13:06.100 --> 13:07.833
I don't need to.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.466
This is the jerk
that's been haunting the place.

13:09.533 --> 13:11.700
Hey, h-hey,
wait a minute. Wait a minute.

13:13.233 --> 13:15.433
- Listen to me.
- Why listen?

13:15.500 --> 13:18.233
I can see your lipstick
on his face.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.033
'The handcuffs are
definitely your style.'

13:20.100 --> 13:21.800
&nbsp;
'Iam telling the

13:21.866 --> 13:23.333
'Like you used
to tell Collin the truth'

13:23.400 --> 13:24.633
'when you and I used to fool
around..'

13:24.700 --> 13:27.766
Hey! Wait a minute! Hey!

13:27.833 --> 13:29.933
Maybe I should just
kick his teeth in?

13:34.466 --> 13:36.066
How did he get outta those

13:36.133 --> 13:38.133
So much for your ghost.

13:40.266 --> 13:42.666
It's really lame, Emma.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.333
Can't you see
there's something weird

13:44.400 --> 13:45.800
going on here?

13:45.866 --> 13:47.200
Weird? Yeah.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.266
Well, I suppose
I should be grateful

13:50.333 --> 13:52.500
you didn't have him up
in our bedroom.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.500
Go to hell.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.333
Ahh!

14:29.566 --> 14:32.133
You know you want me.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.233
You deceitful little bitch.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.233
I knew you were cheating on me.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.533
And you will never..

15:09.600 --> 15:12.033
...cheat on me again.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.566
No. No, no!

15:16.633 --> 15:18.300
No!

15:18.366 --> 15:19.433
No-o-o!

15:49.800 --> 15:51.733
More coffee?

15:53.033 --> 15:54.800
What time did Robert
leave this morning?

15:54.866 --> 15:56.400
Around 6:30.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.433
I know how you feel.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.266
The last time I had a fight
with my boyfriend

16:01.333 --> 16:03.300
we didn't talk for three weeks.

16:05.133 --> 16:07.100
Well, I'm here if you need me.

16:25.766 --> 16:27.366
Hi, Colin.

16:27.433 --> 16:29.066
It's Emma.

16:29.133 --> 16:31.966
I was just thinking about you.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.100
And I want you to know
that I do love you.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.466
And I'm sorry for what happened.

16:35.533 --> 16:37.800
You were really very good to me.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.633
Please call.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.466
I've been thinking
about last night.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.866
I've been thinking about it too.

16:54.933 --> 16:57.600
And I made a decision.

16:57.666 --> 16:59.633
I'm going back to Colin.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.766
You what?

17:03.833 --> 17:07.200
I've betrayed a lot of men
in my life.

17:07.266 --> 17:09.633
But when I left Colin
I betrayed myself.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.733
He's the only man
that's really loved me.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.500
You think you're gonna be
loyal to him all of a sudden?

17:16.566 --> 17:18.833
I'm sorry.
It's the way it's gotta be

17:18.900 --> 17:21.033
You're not walking out on me.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.133
What are you doing?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.166
Robert!

17:28.233 --> 17:29.733
- Let me out!
- Hold it! Ah.

17:33.033 --> 17:35.933
But I won't let you
do this to anyone else.

17:38.033 --> 17:40.000
'Robert.'

17:41.800 --> 17:44.333
'I want any man who wants you..'

17:44.400 --> 17:46.933
'...to know exactly
what he's dealing with.'

17:47.000 --> 17:48.933
No!

19:02.966 --> 19:04.000
You shouldn't have.

19:04.066 --> 19:06.033
- I didn't.
- Well, then, who did?

19:09.566 --> 19:10.533
Colin.

19:21.766 --> 19:23.733
I got your message.
I came immediately.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.233
You can't imagine
how wonderful it feels

19:27.300 --> 19:29.500
to hear you say you love me.

19:29.566 --> 19:31.933
I love you so much,
I-I-I'd do anything

19:32.000 --> 19:33.666
to get you back.

19:33.733 --> 19:35.733
I'll make you
so happy, you know I can.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.433
You know I will, I-I'll buy you
a house better than this.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.200
Come away with me, now.

19:41.266 --> 19:43.400
I can't, now.

19:43.466 --> 19:46.033
But tonight,
I'll give you an answer.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.666
Tonight?

19:50.733 --> 19:54.300
Yes.
Tonight you'll have my answer.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.800
Alright, we gotta talk.

20:03.866 --> 20:06.533
I'm not gonna be one of your
victims, like Colin.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.633
I wanna show you
something upstairs.

20:12.933 --> 20:15.233
I don't think
we should be doing this.

20:15.300 --> 20:18.233
Robert, shut up
for once in your life.

20:19.966 --> 20:21.933
Do you know what love is?

20:23.166 --> 20:25.100
'Cause I'm gonna
show you what love is.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.033
Does that say anything to you?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.600
I'm not sure.

20:35.666 --> 20:38.000
Maybe you'd better
tell me some more.

20:38.066 --> 20:39.800
I love you.

20:39.866 --> 20:42.000
I may not be
very good at it, but..

20:42.066 --> 20:45.333
...I love you more than
anyone in the world.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.566
'No!'

21:21.033 --> 21:24.133
So...I have my answer.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.666
Colin, d-don't be foolish.

21:25.733 --> 21:27.866
Shut up!

21:27.933 --> 21:30.000
Lie down. Right next to her.

21:32.300 --> 21:35.933
It's what you wanted.
And what do you want?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.433
I wanted you,
but then I found out

21:37.500 --> 21:39.033
you were watching us all along.

21:39.100 --> 21:42.133
Yes. I was going to
give you one last chance

21:42.200 --> 21:44.266
but I didn't want
to be fooled again.

21:44.333 --> 21:46.300
How did you know
I'd come here to this house?

21:48.533 --> 21:51.200
Your real estate agent
was told to bring you here..

21:51.266 --> 21:52.433
...and paid to be quiet

21:52.500 --> 21:55.500
and I had had
the house remodeled.

21:55.566 --> 21:57.266
'Yeah, well, you'd always
told me you wanted a house.'

21:57.333 --> 21:59.833
Once here, I knew
you'd fall in love with it.

21:59.900 --> 22:02.300
And hopefully with me.

22:02.366 --> 22:05.933
If you'd only told me...
I would've..

22:06.000 --> 22:07.933
Dumped Robert?

22:10.500 --> 22:13.300
But you just said you loved him.

22:13.366 --> 22:16.166
Oh, wait. You used to
tell me that, too.

22:16.233 --> 22:18.300
Colin, I think
we've both been had.

22:18.366 --> 22:21.100
And I think you should kiss her.

22:21.166 --> 22:22.700
Lie down, Emma.

22:22.766 --> 22:24.733
- What?
- Kiss her!

22:26.000 --> 22:27.933
Like your life depended on it.

22:31.233 --> 22:33.400
No, Colin, I love you!

22:33.466 --> 22:35.333
And I love you.

22:39.966 --> 22:43.733
A four letter word for torture.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.500
Got it!

22:51.766 --> 22:55.133
L...O..

22:55.200 --> 22:58.166
...V...E.

22:58.233 --> 23:00.933
'Lo-ove.'

23:10.833 --> 23:13.200
Hey, wait a minute. Hey!

23:13.266 --> 23:15.100
Hey, wait a minute!

23:15.166 --> 23:17.433
Hey! Hey!

23:29.966 --> 23:32.900
'I woke up in my car
a few hours later.'

23:32.966 --> 23:34.633
That's all I remember.

23:34.700 --> 23:38.133
I came back a couple days later,
but the people were gone.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.533
You mean they moved?

23:39.600 --> 23:42.400
No, I mean they were gone.
Not a trace.

23:43.666 --> 23:46.800
Uh, somehow...this
thing opens up.

23:48.733 --> 23:51.133
How bizarre.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.666
You worked for the people
who lived here, didn't you

23:53.733 --> 23:54.700
Do you know
what happened to them?

23:54.766 --> 23:55.933
Not a clue.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.300
And that's exactly
how I remember it.

23:58.366 --> 24:00.166
I left on Friday night,
they were fine.

24:00.233 --> 24:02.500
I came back back Monday..

24:02.566 --> 24:06.300
Hmm, fascinating. A house
with a sense of intrigue.

24:06.366 --> 24:08.266
I like it.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.666
I'll be alright, my dear.

24:17.533 --> 24:19.733
Alright, I'd like
to go to my room now.

24:19.800 --> 24:22.200
Do I need to sign something?

24:23.133 --> 24:24.100
Yeah.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.633
You know, we should talk.

24:36.633 --> 24:39.366
I mean, here you are, new
in town. Here I am, a native.

24:39.433 --> 24:41.966
I could show you around.

24:42.033 --> 24:45.566
I didn't know Springwood
was such a hotbed of tourism.

24:45.633 --> 24:48.500
And to think we just
came for a little quiet.

24:48.566 --> 24:50.366
Well, there may not
be much to look at

24:50.433 --> 24:52.400
but there sure is a lot to do.

24:53.466 --> 24:56.500
Thanks...but
my dance card's full.

24:57.733 --> 24:59.700
You don't mind
showing yourself out, do you?

25:03.466 --> 25:05.733
Hey, uh...moving man.

25:08.566 --> 25:10.900
What's your name?

25:10.966 --> 25:12.633
Turk.

25:12.700 --> 25:13.700
Turk.

25:14.766 --> 25:16.733
Maybe I'll see you
around sometime.

25:21.866 --> 25:24.866
Good old Turk think he's
one hell of a moving man.

25:24.933 --> 25:28.433
Wait till he sees what happens
whenI

25:29.400 --> 25:30.566
Yes?

25:30.633 --> 25:32.166
This got left on the truck

25:32.233 --> 25:33.466
Thought I'd bring it by.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.500
Oh, well, thank you, I'll see
that Mrs. Hall gets it.

25:36.566 --> 25:38.533
Well, I'd like to
give it to her myself.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.833
Mrs. Hall has gone to bed.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.366
Well, her light's still on

25:42.433 --> 25:43.466
Listen to me.

25:43.533 --> 25:46.300
She's a nice lady
and he's a sick old man.

25:46.366 --> 25:48.766
And you, you're nothing but
a gutter snake out for yourself.

25:48.833 --> 25:50.666
Why don't you leave them alone?

25:50.733 --> 25:52.166
Why don't you go be a maid

25:52.233 --> 25:54.833
Jillian, who is it?

25:54.900 --> 25:57.433
'One of your boxes
was left on my truck.'

25:57.500 --> 25:59.433
It's alright, Jillian,
I'll take care of it.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.000
You shouldn't have come.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.900
I had to see you.

26:13.966 --> 26:15.933
I doubt you're that desperate.

26:18.266 --> 26:20.666
I want you to leave, right now.

26:20.733 --> 26:22.633
No, you don't.

26:22.700 --> 26:25.133
Come on, what's the deal
with you and the old man?

26:25.200 --> 26:27.833
I know you don't sleep together.

26:27.900 --> 26:30.566
I carried boxes
into two bedrooms.

26:30.633 --> 26:33.533
That is none
of your damn business.

26:33.600 --> 26:37.433
Beautiful woman like you?
It's definitely my business.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.466
How long's it been, a year?
A decade?

26:40.533 --> 26:42.500
I love my husband.

26:43.666 --> 26:45.600
What's that
got to do with anything?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.100
I think you owe it to yourself.

26:49.166 --> 26:50.566
No!

26:50.633 --> 26:53.433
Not here.

26:59.633 --> 27:01.633
So how long has it been?

27:02.533 --> 27:05.833
Two years.

27:07.366 --> 27:10.133
Before Victor's accident.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.066
Seems like a waste.

27:13.133 --> 27:15.100
Amazing woman like you.

27:16.666 --> 27:19.233
Well, you may not
believe it, but Victor..

27:19.300 --> 27:22.800
...is the kindest,
gentlest man in the world.

27:24.366 --> 27:25.533
...even the sexiest.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.933
Then what are you
doing in bed with me?

27:29.000 --> 27:32.200
Well, there are some thing
Victor can't do, but..

27:32.266 --> 27:35.300
...doesn't mean
there isn't sex of a kind.

27:35.366 --> 27:37.566
We play games.

27:37.633 --> 27:39.533
Nothing with handcuffs.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.566
No.

27:41.633 --> 27:45.533
Victor has a collection
of, uh, antique pistols.

27:47.866 --> 27:50.266
We do role-playing.

27:50.333 --> 27:52.266
Sometimes..

27:52.333 --> 27:54.900
...he's a spy.

27:54.966 --> 27:57.566
Sometimes he's a pirate.

27:57.633 --> 28:01.166
And he...holds
me at gunpoint and..

28:01.233 --> 28:03.833
...makes me strip
while he watches.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.333
Makes him feel in control.

28:08.900 --> 28:11.500
Control is very sexy.

28:13.766 --> 28:16.533
So he likes guns, uh?

28:16.600 --> 28:18.533
The gun isn't loaded.

28:20.233 --> 28:22.200
Hmm, I might be crazy.

28:24.533 --> 28:28.433
To me, anything less than a
hands on experience is stupid.

28:59.933 --> 29:01.466
- It's Victor.
- Yeah?

29:01.533 --> 29:04.033
Quick. It's Victor. If he
find you he'll kill you.

29:08.733 --> 29:10.766
Victor.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.566
I didn't expect you'd come
this evening, darling.

29:13.633 --> 29:15.266
Well, I wanted to surprise you.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.633
I thought we might play

29:16.700 --> 29:19.333
a little game of Yankee spy.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.233
'What's the matter?'

29:24.233 --> 29:25.533
You look pale.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.600
'Nothing.'

29:31.900 --> 29:34.800
No, there's something
the matter. I know you.

29:35.866 --> 29:38.600
Something's wrong, I can tell.

29:38.666 --> 29:42.033
'Nothing is wrong.
I swear it. Victor.'

29:52.666 --> 29:55.166
I just came to say
goodnight, my love.

29:55.233 --> 29:58.000
Victor, I can explain
everything.

29:58.066 --> 30:01.800
There's no need to explain.
Does he satisfy you?

30:05.100 --> 30:07.133
If he does, ask him to stay.

30:08.366 --> 30:11.300
'I only ever
want you to be happy.'

30:20.000 --> 30:23.166
That is one very strange guy.

30:23.233 --> 30:25.000
No.

30:25.066 --> 30:27.633
He's the most wonderful ma
in the world.

30:29.566 --> 30:32.100
So?

30:33.966 --> 30:35.400
Will you?

30:35.466 --> 30:37.700
What? Stay for the night?

30:37.766 --> 30:39.566
No.

30:39.633 --> 30:43.433
Not for the night. Forever

30:55.900 --> 30:58.566
'Good morning, young man,
sleep well?'

30:58.633 --> 31:00.533
I wanna know why
you're doing this.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.800
Why are you letting me
sleep with your wife?

31:03.866 --> 31:07.433
Do you know anything about guns?

31:08.600 --> 31:09.566
'Oh, that's too bad.'

31:09.633 --> 31:12.466
I've devoted my life to them.

31:12.533 --> 31:14.400
You know, young man

31:14.466 --> 31:17.033
there's more than one way
to satisfy a woman.

31:18.333 --> 31:20.400
I'd have thought you knew that.

31:20.466 --> 31:22.866
'After all, I knew that
when I was your age.'

31:22.933 --> 31:24.900
'You're exactly like I was.'

31:26.766 --> 31:30.566
One doesn't necessarily...
have to fire it

31:30.633 --> 31:32.766
to appreciate it's beauty.

31:35.733 --> 31:37.700
And you really don't mind?

31:38.466 --> 31:41.466
No. I don't mind at all.

31:41.533 --> 31:44.366
Through you I can
satisfy Evelyn again.

31:44.433 --> 31:47.300
I can give her the love
she deserves to receive.

31:49.966 --> 31:51.933
So, you'll stay?

31:53.866 --> 31:55.766
Good.

31:55.833 --> 31:58.366
Oh, well, would you, uh,
mind putting this back for me?

31:58.433 --> 32:00.433
I'm afraid I can't reach.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.666
You really are magnificent

32:39.733 --> 32:43.033
No, you're magnificent.

32:44.166 --> 32:46.533
That Victor's one lucky guy.

32:46.600 --> 32:47.600
Mmm.

32:48.933 --> 32:51.300
You know,
in so many ways you're..

32:51.366 --> 32:53.933
...so much like him
before the accident.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.433
It's a strange feeling.

32:59.233 --> 33:02.500
It's almost like I'm falling
in love with him again.

33:02.566 --> 33:06.300
Yeah, that's kind of strange.

33:09.466 --> 33:13.100
Well, it's late.

33:13.166 --> 33:15.100
I've got
a thousand things to do.

33:18.633 --> 33:20.700
You'll still be here
when I get back, won't you

33:22.733 --> 33:24.700
Yeah.. be right here.

33:25.433 --> 33:26.433
Okay.

33:38.833 --> 33:40.800
I could get used to this.

33:44.866 --> 33:47.033
I'm impressed.

33:47.100 --> 33:49.300
You got through the front door
and the bedroom door.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.333
What next?

33:52.400 --> 33:55.166
You know, I get the feeling
you don't like me.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.133
You're a fool.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.133
Why don't you
pack it in and go home?

34:00.200 --> 34:02.366
No, thanks.

34:02.433 --> 34:04.900
I think
I'll stick around a while.

34:04.966 --> 34:07.366
You don't get it, do you?

34:07.433 --> 34:10.033
Victor's made it safe for you.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.766
And you're a guy
who likes danger.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.600
How much longer do you think
this is gonna work for you

34:17.533 --> 34:19.166
What are you getting at?

34:19.233 --> 34:22.600
Evelyn's a lady.
She's got breeding.

34:22.666 --> 34:25.266
She's not like you and me.

34:25.333 --> 34:27.700
She's already
fallen in love with you.

34:29.333 --> 34:32.133
You need someone who wouldn't
dare fall in love with you.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.533
Someone who could do this.

34:41.733 --> 34:43.700
... and walk out.

35:29.133 --> 35:30.633
He told you?

35:30.700 --> 35:32.633
Of course he told me.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.333
He loves me.

35:37.733 --> 35:39.700
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

35:41.500 --> 35:43.433
You'll be sorry.

35:44.566 --> 35:46.633
Come on, it's not even loaded,
Evelyn.

35:46.700 --> 35:48.633
Oh, no.

35:53.300 --> 35:56.066
Come on, Evelyn,
I said I'm sorry.

35:56.133 --> 35:59.933
Just like you said it, what..
a thousand times before?

36:00.833 --> 36:02.733
Evelyn, please.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.533
Mine is the last heart

36:04.600 --> 36:06.933
you'll ever break.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.433
Oh, ho-hold it.
Let's talk about this.

36:31.500 --> 36:34.833
Take it.

36:40.366 --> 36:42.600
Go on.. take it.

36:49.700 --> 36:51.633
Now, tell me.

36:53.066 --> 36:55.233
Tell you what?

36:55.300 --> 36:58.200
Tell me what comes off first.

36:58.266 --> 37:00.933
What are you nuts?

37:01.000 --> 37:02.933
Come on, Turk,
you're so much like Victor.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.933
I thought it'd be fun.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.933
Now, tell me.

37:11.300 --> 37:14.000
Come on, play.

37:14.066 --> 37:17.933
Victor usually has me
take my stockings off first.

37:20.033 --> 37:22.333
Look, can we just do it..
normally?

37:22.400 --> 37:25.866
No. Play the game.

37:25.933 --> 37:27.566
Is this gun loaded or not?

37:27.633 --> 37:29.600
Course not.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.700
Alright. Take off your stocking.

37:35.833 --> 37:37.966
Don't you want me
to take my shoe off first?

37:38.033 --> 37:40.033
Yeah, yeah, take 'em,
take 'em both off.

37:56.300 --> 37:58.233
Now, take the other one off.

38:06.366 --> 38:08.333
Now, take off your top.

38:12.233 --> 38:13.966
I said take off your damn top.

38:14.033 --> 38:15.533
That's it. Get into it.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.533
Just...just take it off.

38:18.600 --> 38:21.233
Good. Now, make&lt;ro

38:24.200 --> 38:25.900
No, this is stupid,
I can't do this.

38:25.966 --> 38:28.533
If you don't play,
you get nothing.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.733
I don't like games.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.733
But I do.

38:32.533 --> 38:34.500
So play it for me.

38:36.933 --> 38:37.933
Please.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.733
Take it off.

38:49.866 --> 38:51.800
Take it off or I'll shoot.

38:51.866 --> 38:53.700
- No.
- Take it off!

38:53.766 --> 38:54.733
No!

39:11.466 --> 39:13.833
Turk, what've you done?

39:13.900 --> 39:17.033
The gun, I-I...I didn't know it
was loaded. It was an accident.

39:17.100 --> 39:19.233
Well, I have to call the police.

39:19.300 --> 39:22.066
No, they'd never believe me, I..

39:22.133 --> 39:24.300
- I gotta get outta here.
- You'll never get away.

39:24.366 --> 39:26.833
Victor finds the body,
he calls the police

39:26.900 --> 39:29.000
they catch you,
then you'll look really guilty.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.400
What the hell am I gonna do?

39:31.466 --> 39:33.433
First thing is hide the body.

39:34.666 --> 39:37.100
Do you want to leave her here
for Victor to find?

39:40.366 --> 39:42.333
Come on. We'll hide her in here.

40:07.133 --> 40:09.633
You know, I bet it was Victor.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.533
He's one shrewd son of a bitch.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.333
What the hell
are you talking about?

40:13.400 --> 40:15.333
Let me show you something.

40:16.366 --> 40:18.733
Victor loaded the gun.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.533
No, you crazy?

40:20.600 --> 40:22.533
He loved Evelyn.
Why would he want her dead

40:22.600 --> 40:25.800
Because of you.
You drove him over the edge.

40:28.500 --> 40:31.033
No, wait. Victor wanted me here.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.700
Victor liked to watch.
He was using you.

40:42.133 --> 40:44.766
Sitting here watching
you make love to his wife

40:44.833 --> 40:47.933
something must have snapped.
He's still a man.

40:49.333 --> 40:51.133
So, what do we do?

40:51.200 --> 40:54.433
We wipe the slate clean.
Then we get out of here.

40:55.466 --> 40:57.933
But I can't shoot Victor.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.700
If you don't,
he'll call the police

40:59.766 --> 41:02.966
or he'll kill you himself.
He hasn't given you a choice.

41:03.033 --> 41:05.366
'Evelyn? Evelyn.'

41:05.433 --> 41:07.400
Push that.

41:12.433 --> 41:14.533
Have you seen Evelyn?

41:14.600 --> 41:16.066
You're not getting away
with this.

41:16.133 --> 41:17.433
What are you talking about?

41:17.500 --> 41:19.733
You set me up
to shoot your wife.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.533
Shoot my wife?
You hurt Evelyn, where is she?

41:22.600 --> 41:23.766
Get off it.

41:23.833 --> 41:25.266
You probably watched
the whole thing

41:25.333 --> 41:27.766
you sick, pathetic old man.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.300
What makes you think I did this?

41:29.366 --> 41:31.533
You think I went to
the gun case, stood up

41:31.600 --> 41:33.233
took out the gun and loaded it?

41:33.300 --> 41:34.766
There's one thing you know
for sure, Turk

41:34.833 --> 41:37.466
it's that I can't walk or move.

41:37.533 --> 41:39.366
Evelyn could have gotten
the pistol from the case.

41:39.433 --> 41:42.333
Yes, but, uh, who got
the bullets out of the case?

41:42.400 --> 41:45.333
Evelyn? Or Jillian?

41:46.300 --> 41:47.800
You?

41:47.866 --> 41:50.133
Well, if no one else
is going to call the police--

41:50.200 --> 41:52.233
Jillian, stop.

41:52.300 --> 41:53.900
You haven't got the guts.

41:56.733 --> 41:58.033
Bravo.

42:21.666 --> 42:23.066
Well, ahem.

42:23.133 --> 42:26.466
Well done, Turk,
a magnificent performance. Mmm!

42:26.533 --> 42:28.466
We couldn't have written better.

42:28.533 --> 42:30.600
'I-I'm afraid we've been less
than honest with you, Turk.'

42:30.666 --> 42:32.100
My-my name is Colin.

42:32.166 --> 42:34.833
My friends and I have been
having a little fun with you.

42:38.200 --> 42:40.100
You mean, uh,
none of this stuff is real?

42:40.166 --> 42:42.933
No, no, it..
No, i-it was all play-acting.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.700
Just a...harmless
little psycho drama.

42:49.566 --> 42:53.233
It's a, it's a joke?

42:53.300 --> 42:56.833
Well, not all of it.

42:56.900 --> 42:59.966
Oh, no, no, i-it wasn't a joke.
W-w-would you call life a joke?

43:00.033 --> 43:01.733
This was theater.

43:01.800 --> 43:05.133
See, we cast you in the role
of the ladies man.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.800
'Huh? I mean, isn't that
how you've cast yourself?'

43:09.333 --> 43:10.966
I'm sorry it's over.

43:11.033 --> 43:12.600
Me too.

43:12.666 --> 43:14.466
Yeah, well, actually,
i-it's not quite over yet.

43:14.533 --> 43:16.966
See, we have
one last point to make.

43:17.033 --> 43:18.700
- Point?
- 'Uh.'

43:18.766 --> 43:22.033
Well, yes, this is, after all,
a morality play.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.333
Yes.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.833
The man who lives
by his spike..

43:29.133 --> 43:31.100
...shall perish by the spike.

43:41.300 --> 43:42.566
Mmm!

43:42.633 --> 43:45.300
Mm, would you
like another espresso

43:45.366 --> 43:46.733
mypetit chou?

43:46.800 --> 43:48.666
Yeah. Thanks, doll.

44:01.666 --> 44:04.200
&nbsp;
Madame and monsieur

44:04.266 --> 44:06.200
the milkman is here.

44:07.633 --> 44:09.800
Oh, milkman.

44:09.866 --> 44:12.266
- Mm-mm.
- Yes.

44:12.333 --> 44:14.300
A perfectn'est ce pas?.

44:15.733 --> 44:19.033
Show him in.

44:24.733 --> 44:27.000
'Hey, babe, I, uh'

44:27.066 --> 44:29.033
'I think we should talk.'

44:29.100 --> 44:31.333
'I mean, here you are'

44:31.400 --> 44:33.633
'you're new in town.'

44:33.700 --> 44:37.033
'Here I am, a native.'

44:40.366 --> 44:42.333
I could show you around.

44:43.600 --> 44:46.733
I love love games.
