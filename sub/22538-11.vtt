go!

00:23.720 --> 00:25.180
police!

00:25.260 --> 00:27.110
Get your hands up!wait,stop!

00:27.280 --> 00:29.090
Clear!

00:29.200 --> 00:30.610
Get your hands up!

00:30.740 --> 00:32.270
Ah,we're good here,boss.

00:46.060 --> 00:49.180
police!Put the gun down!Put
it down now!Put it down!

00:49.490 --> 00:52.240
you!Off the bed!Don't move!Don't move!

00:52.440 --> 00:54.130
Don't move!

00:56.070 --> 00:57.980
This is notwhat it looks like.

00:58.060 --> 00:59.100
It's not?

00:59.180 --> 01:04.769
Because it looks like the smoking ruins of
what was shaping up to be a promising career.

01:04.849 --> 01:06.910
Come on!We wasn't even doin' nothing.

01:06.950 --> 01:09.380
Well,boss,apparently,they
wasn't even doin' nothing.

01:10.290 --> 01:13.780
I doubt the councilman came
by to show off his legislation.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.160
Isn't that right?

01:15.230 --> 01:18.440
The councilmember just can't
control his councilmember!

01:27.770 --> 01:29.280
so he's a councilman?

01:29.370 --> 01:30.620
Bobby prince.

01:30.730 --> 01:33.300
You haven't seen him on
television?The fighting councilman?

01:33.330 --> 01:35.330
He's always up on his
soapbox about something.

01:35.400 --> 01:39.300
This morning,I think he was more
interested in misty's soapbox.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.070
Looking good,casanova.

01:42.200 --> 01:46.120
Nothin' like a raid on a no-tell
motel to start the morning off right.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.220
Prince is a big city hall fish.

01:51.250 --> 01:53.830
tyler and I are gonna take him
back to the precinct for booking.

01:53.930 --> 01:56.290
You and no-nuts stay here
and take some statements.

01:56.420 --> 01:59.940
Aw,loot,why can't I go back with you,and
have spaceman and no-nuts do the canvass?

02:00.020 --> 02:03.420
Nope,just me and our
transfer from hyde here.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.680
Meet ya at the car,tyler.

02:07.650 --> 02:09.840
What the hell was that about?

02:09.910 --> 02:13.630
Well,maybe he found out you
bumped his daughter's bones.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.290
So where should we start?

02:20.380 --> 02:22.700
Right here,okay?I got
a statement for you.

02:22.700 --> 02:25.830
Are you ready?Coffee.Bagel.Pronto.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.640
I didn't mean to shoot at ya.

02:32.710 --> 02:34.350
I was just scared.

02:34.390 --> 02:36.340
I thought you were someone else.

02:36.340 --> 02:38.940
I just... don't know how I got here.

02:38.990 --> 02:41.940
Well,there's an "f" train a few blocks
away and a bus stop on the corner.

02:42.020 --> 02:43.620
You don't understand.

02:43.740 --> 02:47.550
A few months ago,I was walking down orchard street
when somebody clubbed me on the back of the head.

02:47.580 --> 02:52.790
The next thing I knew,I
was here... in 1973.

02:52.870 --> 02:57.990
They had an apartment for
me,clothes... a whole life.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.510
Where are you from?

03:04.540 --> 03:10.490
I'm from 2009,and I
don't know how I got here.

03:14.930 --> 03:16.790
My name is sam tyler.

03:16.840 --> 03:20.270
I was in an accident,anI
woke up in 1973.

03:20.300 --> 03:23.810
I don't know how or why  I'm
here,but whatever's happened,

03:23.870 --> 03:25.980
it's like I've landed
 on a different planet.

03:26.110 --> 03:29.780
Now maybe if I can work out
 the reason,I can get home.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.460
Did anybody order chinese?

03:50.650 --> 03:52.120
Delivery!Who order delivery?Please,sir.

03:52.310 --> 03:53.660
You! That's what I'm explaining to her.

03:53.780 --> 03:57.410
Never should've agreed to handle
overflow for the 1-3-8 today.

03:57.800 --> 03:58.950
Book ts creep,would ya?

03:59.050 --> 04:00.730
put him by my desk.

04:02.780 --> 04:04.580
what's going on with the telephones?

04:04.820 --> 04:06.130
I can't hear myself stew.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.860
Been acting screwy all morning.

04:07.970 --> 04:09.560
Probably that new switchboard.

04:09.660 --> 04:11.810
Get as many people as you
can into holding cells.

04:11.870 --> 04:13.970
We'll process 'em one by one.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.510
come on,guys!

04:15.580 --> 04:17.320
Make yourself useful,tyler.

04:17.399 --> 04:20.910
I'm gonna go get a rundown on just what
the hell is happening here from sizable ted.

04:21.089 --> 04:22.980
Is everything okay,boss?

04:24.370 --> 04:26.500
Why wouldn't everything be okay,tyler?

04:37.050 --> 04:38.680
my own maid of
honor,david?How could you?

04:38.820 --> 04:41.100
- When I get my hands on you...
- sam!

04:41.230 --> 04:42.740
Can you help me for a second?

04:42.870 --> 04:43.850
only once!

04:43.910 --> 04:45.250
- how could you?
- stop.Stop.

04:45.340 --> 04:47.740
- When I get my hands on you...
- please,baby,tell me what to do!

04:47.870 --> 04:49.580
- I'm begging you!...
- I got her,chris

04:49.640 --> 04:51.770
.Straight throug your cold black heart!

04:51.810 --> 04:53.350
- Come here!Come here.
- Go to hell!

04:53.470 --> 04:55.040
God!Sit down.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.220
Cool off.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.490
Hey,why won't anybody
listen to me?Hey,listen.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.380
Listen,those thugs-- they keep spray painting my
car,and you guys ain't doing nothin' about it,huh?

05:00.440 --> 05:01.370
I'll get to you,sir.

05:01.470 --> 05:02.970
I'm with someone else right now.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.420
Who,that guy?

05:04.520 --> 05:06.750
That lousy son of a bitch
politician is better off dead.

05:06.790 --> 05:08.320
All right.Hey,you,take a seat.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.980
- You--I see
you!- Take a seat.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.890
Please,detective,I can't
be incarcerated right now.

05:15.940 --> 05:16.840
Thanks.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.270
I think someone might be after me.

05:18.350 --> 05:21.590
If you really are from
2009,how can you prove it?

05:21.670 --> 05:23.930
- What happens to the berlin wall?
- It goes down.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.590
Do the red sox ever
win the world series?

05:25.750 --> 05:26.860
A couple of times.

05:27.030 --> 05:30.400
Okay,uh--and there's
a black president.

05:30.470 --> 05:32.840
Our first.

05:33.030 --> 05:35.230
He actually won?

05:35.550 --> 05:39.050
The future... it's all right.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.450
I mean,some bad things happen,but
there's some good things,too.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.240
It's hopeful.

05:45.290 --> 05:47.070
Not like here.

05:47.560 --> 05:51.750
It's hopeful.It's hopeful.

05:51.830 --> 05:53.470
Sam,I need your help in here now!

05:53.520 --> 05:54.560
Chris,come on!

05:54.650 --> 05:56.240

05:58.740 --> 06:00.650

- Stay right there.

06:00.820 --> 06:03.070
Don't move.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.720
I only left him for a minute!

06:08.780 --> 06:10.940

06:35.140 --> 06:36.410

- Who did it?

06:36.480 --> 06:37.900
get 'em down!

06:37.990 --> 06:40.430
They killed me because
I found the way home.

06:41.380 --> 06:43.300
- The way home?
- toss 'em one by one!

06:43.750 --> 06:45.550
What--what...

There'S...

06:57.110 --> 07:00.800
no. no.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.110
Who did this?

07:14.610 --> 07:16.830
Somebody saw something.

07:17.450 --> 07:19.970
Somebody must've seen something.

07:21.230 --> 07:23.290
What are you doing here?

07:24.900 --> 07:26.170
Lock it down.

07:26.540 --> 07:27.140
Lock it down.

07:27.230 --> 07:31.720
This is a crime scene.No one gets in or
out of the 1-2-5 until we figure this out.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.250
Sarge,lock us down.

07:41.030 --> 07:43.100
Lock us down.

07:49.050 --> 07:50.150
What are you doing?

07:50.190 --> 07:52.640
We need a fu account of all
the guns in the precinct.

07:52.980 --> 07:56.420
Everyone was tossed after
the shooting.No gun was found.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.330
Do you think it could've
been one of our own?

07:58.390 --> 08:00.320
I don't think.I react.

08:00.390 --> 08:01.820
Let me see yours.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.500
- What?
- Now.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.470
Maria,would you wait in my office?

08:14.290 --> 08:15.070
What for?

08:15.140 --> 08:17.030
There is a killer in our midst.

08:17.090 --> 08:18.650
I am being a doting father.

08:18.710 --> 08:20.500
In my office.

08:21.980 --> 08:25.230
Detective tyler,would you please
deposit maria in my office?

08:25.290 --> 08:26.590
NoW.

08:38.289 --> 08:40.200
who would want to shoot the councilman?

08:40.429 --> 08:42.280
Not sure.Maria,why are you here?

08:42.340 --> 08:44.440
I wanted to... talk.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.260
Well,this is not a good time.

08:46.350 --> 08:47.830
Well,clearly.

08:48.710 --> 08:53.530
I think he knows about
the,um... file room.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.390
Of course he knows.

08:57.720 --> 09:02.410
He may not be many things,buT...
he is a good detective.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.930
I'll be right back.

09:10.970 --> 09:12.500
none of these were fired.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.630
The killer must've hid the gun
during the chaos after the shooting.

09:15.660 --> 09:18.630
I wanna conduct a complete area search.

09:22.430 --> 09:24.080
Hey,chris.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.650
Who would've wanted this guy dead?

09:26.710 --> 09:29.350
Annie said something about
him being on the news.

09:29.450 --> 09:31.910
And on the radio,and in the papers.

09:32.020 --> 09:37.160
I mean,he's always causing a stink--
gun control,zoning laws,minimum wage.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.600
Can you imagine?

09:39.810 --> 09:43.510
But if someone wanted to whack the
councilman,why do it when he's in police custody?

09:43.620 --> 09:45.230
It's a desperate move.

09:45.370 --> 09:47.660
Yeah.Somebody needed
him dead right away.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.570
All right,we separated all the
suspects with a vantage point,

09:52.660 --> 09:56.430
put the rest of them back in the holding
cells except for our,uh,suicidal groom here.

09:56.460 --> 09:57.690
Figured we better keep an eye on him.

09:57.740 --> 09:59.390
Yeah,good.

09:59.450 --> 10:03.130
Detective?Look,I'm no criminal.

10:03.310 --> 10:04.700
I got mugged this morning.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.260
- I came here to file a complaint.
- Hey,you cra?

10:06.340 --> 10:07.430
- I'm not even supposed to be here.
-oh,come on.

10:07.480 --> 10:11.370
- What are you doing?
- I got a plane leaving to go home to wisconsin this afternoon.

10:11.430 --> 10:13.200
My wife is gonna have a conniption.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.700
You gotta let me go.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.410
Take a seat.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.100
Sizable?Sit down.

10:20.230 --> 10:21.730
Oh,thank you.

10:21.890 --> 10:25.000
The councilman's briefcase--
it was in his room at the motel.

10:26.450 --> 10:28.030
I found the deed to his condo.

10:28.100 --> 10:32.250
Just this morning,he sigd it over
to a woman named elena kastin.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.210
Start pulling up any files
yocan find on this wan.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.560
Okay.

10:42.450 --> 10:45.390
you were intimately involved
with the councilman this morning.

10:45.890 --> 10:47.890
Anything you'd like to confess,misty?

10:48.020 --> 10:49.580
Any pillow talk?

10:49.660 --> 10:52.230
We met five minutes
before you two showed up.

10:52.300 --> 10:55.610
In my line of work,we don't
find much time for pillow talk.

10:58.570 --> 11:01.890
Maybe you faked your attempted suicide.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.310
Me?

11:03.420 --> 11:05.840
So that the bride of frankenstein
here could pop the councilman.

11:05.890 --> 11:06.730
- What?No!
- What?No,no,no!

11:06.910 --> 11:08.780
No,I don't believe in violence.

11:08.820 --> 11:12.760
No,I mean,unless it's against my
lying,cheating husband,that is!

11:12.830 --> 11:13.840
I tried to kill myself!

11:13.900 --> 11:17.840
- What more do I gotta do to show
you-- I'm not your marriage counselor!

11:17.950 --> 11:19.770
Shut up!

11:19.980 --> 11:22.670
Hold off on this domestic squabble
until we get this thing settled.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.430
Got it?

11:25.720 --> 11:28.440
- You.
- Me?

11:28.510 --> 11:31.320
- up.Now.
- Oh,come on.You gotta be kiddin'.

11:31.380 --> 11:33.140
I ain't going nowhere.

11:33.590 --> 11:35.020
Sizable.

11:35.260 --> 11:36.910
Hey,one sec!Come on!

11:36.970 --> 11:38.890
You ain't gotta do that!

11:42.870 --> 11:43.730
Who shot him?

11:43.820 --> 11:45.910
that's what we're
trying to determine now.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.640
It was bedlam in here.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.520
None of our guys saw anything.

11:49.620 --> 11:54.030
Hunt's ordered a lockdown,so we need you
and annie to investigate from the outside.

11:54.220 --> 11:55.550
all right.What do we know?

11:55.630 --> 12:00.370
Well,the councilman signed over the deed to his
condo this morning to a woman named elena kastin.

12:01.030 --> 12:02.800
No address for her so far.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.760
Uh,well,it can't be just a coincidence
that on the morning the guy's murdered

12:05.850 --> 12:09.220
he signs his digs over to this
chic we'll do some nosing around.

12:09.300 --> 12:10.780
We'll get back to you.

12:10.900 --> 12:14.910
Why don't you take the
rest of the day off,nouts?

12:14.950 --> 12:16.200
Go catch a matinee.

12:16.290 --> 12:17.960
"The way we were"is
playing in times square.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.380
It's a nice twirl picture-- made my
wife cry,and she's meaner than mussolini.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.500
I'm going with you.

12:23.580 --> 12:27.200
Look,just because some morons
think you ladies can be detectives,

12:27.250 --> 12:30.220
don't mean you can pretend
to be one for one day,okay?

12:30.320 --> 12:33.440
You're a policewoman--
emphasis on the "woman.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.720
" You heard what sam said.

12:34.780 --> 12:37.160
Hunt wants us both on the case.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.720
We're wasting time.

12:38.850 --> 12:39.790
Unbelievable.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.060
Next thing you know,they'll
be letting 'em vote.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.020
We already can vote,ray.

12:44.050 --> 12:45.950
Don't remind me.

12:46.070 --> 12:50.680
I-I was all the way across the room trying to
flag down an officer when the councilman got shot.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.130
I didn't see nothin'.

12:52.210 --> 12:55.210
You did tell one of my guys the
councilman was better off dead.

12:55.270 --> 13:00.770
I-I was forced to close down my dry cleaning
shop when the councilman rezoned the neighborhood.

13:00.810 --> 13:01.990
Okay,now I'm flat broke.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.220
So it was about revenge.

13:03.390 --> 13:06.490
Oh,believe me.I would've loved
to kill the councilman myself.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.980
I would.But look at me.I'm not a killer.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.100
You did see something!

13:10.770 --> 13:16.240
I...  uh... ok--I saw
the--I-I-I saw the chinese guy.

13:16.310 --> 13:19.930
He--he whispered something into the councilman's
ear right--right before he got popped.

13:22.380 --> 13:23.510
Don't give me trouble!

13:23.640 --> 13:25.250
You no pay,you no eat!

13:25.450 --> 13:28.460
I already told you,we got
a monthly tab with ma yang.

13:28.540 --> 13:29.590
We're practically family.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.530
- Now give me the food!
- Give him the box.

13:31.590 --> 13:33.920
No.No.No can do.

13:34.170 --> 13:37.120
You can... and you will.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.920
What have we here?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.540
Not my gun.No!I don't know.Not my gun.

13:46.630 --> 13:50.650
Well,it sure as hell
ain't my moo goo gai pan.

13:51.580 --> 13:55.870
if someone was after prince that would
explain the paranoia,but not the rest of it.

13:56.290 --> 13:57.850
What's the rest of it?

13:58.220 --> 14:01.310
chris,medical examiner's guys are here.

14:01.460 --> 14:03.170
I'll go sign to release the body.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.730
detective tyler.

14:39.570 --> 14:41.320
Thank you.

14:41.390 --> 14:42.820
You're welcome.

14:42.870 --> 14:45.030
Am I under house arrest?

14:45.130 --> 14:46.920
We all are.

14:49.150 --> 14:55.140
Does it scare you... if he knows?

14:55.920 --> 14:57.690
Does it scare you?

14:57.860 --> 14:59.600
You kidding me?

14:59.710 --> 15:03.480
this is his dream,his
version of parenting--

15:03.530 --> 15:06.690
lock us up,kept where
he can keep an eye...

15:08.360 --> 15:10.060
can I get you anything else?

15:10.170 --> 15:12.320
Want to meet me in the
file roomin ten minutes?

15:12.450 --> 15:15.530
- Maria.
- I'm kidding,sam.I'm fine.

15:15.660 --> 15:19.680
Just find your shooter so I can get
the hell out of my father's office.

15:26.310 --> 15:30.950
If mr.Prince was involved in anything he
shouldn't have been,I would have known.

15:31.060 --> 15:35.830
You learn a lot about a person being their
secretary-- not just how they take their coffee.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.850
I'm sure you understand.

15:41.870 --> 15:45.760
Did,uh,did the councilman have
any enemies that you were aware of?

15:45.760 --> 15:47.940
He'd only been in
office for a few months,

15:47.990 --> 15:53.080
but it's no secret that mr.Prince was
not exactly beloved among the community.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.330
To them he was this eccentric politician
who seemed to fall out of the sky.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.400
Do you mind if I have a look around?

15:59.520 --> 16:01.750
No,help yourself.

16:04.270 --> 16:09.080
Mr.Prince talked about what
this city could one day become,

16:09.320 --> 16:13.110
how poverty and unemployment
wouldn't always be what it is today.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.980
I found it inspiring.

16:16.180 --> 16:17.770
What's all this?

16:17.900 --> 16:20.690
I'm just trying to make sense
of what's happening to me.

16:23.490 --> 16:25.840
annie.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.850
Anything back there?

16:28.940 --> 16:30.950
Nothing.

16:31.210 --> 16:35.630
Did you notice anything different about
the councilman's behavior in recent weeks?

16:35.990 --> 16:40.810
He was a little anxious
and confused at times.

16:40.860 --> 16:45.260
He'd sometimes forget where
he was or--or where he lived.

16:45.360 --> 16:49.360
He often spoke about leaving,going
back where he came from.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.560
Did he ever mention a
woman named elena kastin?

16:52.650 --> 16:55.490
No.I never heard that name.

16:55.700 --> 17:00.790
Were you aware of any,uh,stops that prince
had to make this morning,any meetings?

17:00.900 --> 17:03.990
The only meeting I'm
aware of is later today.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.569
Aaron avery park.

17:06.589 --> 17:10.030
I'm supposed to pick up a
package for mr.Prince at 4:00 P.M.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.770
A package from who?

17:11.940 --> 17:13.079
I don't know.

17:13.089 --> 17:20.069
I only spoke to him on the phone,but I know
this package was very important to mr.Prince.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.339
Well,it's best if you don't
go.That could be dangerous.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.540
You--you let us
take care of it.

17:28.660 --> 17:31.730
please,I don't want trouble!

17:31.820 --> 17:34.530
It's a simple question.

17:34.830 --> 17:38.160
what was the gun doing in your bag?

17:38.290 --> 17:40.240
I leave bag on floor next to councilman.

17:40.330 --> 17:43.750
I ask him,"watch food,"
while I go look for payment.

17:44.110 --> 17:46.140
All of a sudden,bang,bang!

17:46.260 --> 17:47.530
I drop to floor.

17:47.710 --> 17:49.510
You're saying you didn't
know that gun was in that bag?

17:49.550 --> 17:51.380
No,sir!

17:51.550 --> 17:53.360
It's been wiped clean
and defaced to boot.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.480
No fingerprints,noerial numbers.

17:56.570 --> 17:57.460
Want to book him?

17:57.540 --> 17:59.980
He was just as surpris to see
the gun in the bag as I was.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.810
Somebody planted it.

18:02.010 --> 18:04.060
Take him back to the squad,sizable.

18:04.450 --> 18:05.290
Wait!Listen to me!

18:05.390 --> 18:08.090
At least councilman was better tipper!

18:08.180 --> 18:09.920
You know the problem with
punching a chinese guy?

18:09.980 --> 18:11.710
An hour later,you want
to punch him again.

18:11.780 --> 18:14.110
here.

18:16.050 --> 18:20.060
so you're gonna go to the arranged meeting
at the park posing as prince's secretary?

18:20.260 --> 18:22.460
Yeah.If this package was so
important to the councilman,

18:22.500 --> 18:24.780
it might help us figure
out who killed him.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.110
Listen,there's something else
you should know about prince.

18:28.230 --> 18:32.980
He told me,um,he told
me he was from 2009.

18:33.260 --> 18:36.220
That might explain what
I found in his office.

18:36.340 --> 18:38.060
What?Wh was it?

18:38.210 --> 18:44.340
He had a list of possible explanations
practically identical to the one you have.

18:51.120 --> 18:58.170
Annie... the last thing he told me before
he died was that he found the way home.

18:59.060 --> 19:02.190
Maybe that'shy he signed over the
deed to the condo this morning.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.140
He thought he was going home.

19:06.290 --> 19:11.150
The councilman's secretary didn't know anything
about an elena kastin,and they seemed pretty close.

19:12.790 --> 19:15.790
all the more reason for
him to keep elena a secret.

19:16.260 --> 19:20.290
- I'll radio you later.Bye.
- Bye.

19:24.690 --> 19:26.690
you wanna bite?

19:27.070 --> 19:32.620
I can't go to the park in my uniform,but I
don't have time to run back to queens and change.

19:34.870 --> 19:38.330
You're about the same size as my wife,give
or take a few slices of pepperoni.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.800
Why don't we go pay a visit?

19:45.910 --> 19:47.310
It's true what they say.

19:47.460 --> 19:50.720
- You never appreciate your home until it's taken away from you.
- Amen!

19:50.750 --> 19:52.030
Thank you.

19:52.130 --> 19:56.360
I just wanted to see the view from
the top of the empire state building,

19:56.500 --> 19:59.440
maybe eat a pretzel from
one of those street carts.

20:00.310 --> 20:02.320
Detective,please let me call my wife.

20:02.450 --> 20:04.180
I missed my flight.She's
gonna be so worried.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.930
Just be patient.We'll let you
know when you can make a call.

20:07.100 --> 20:10.030
Hey,elena,could you pass me
that cup of coffee,please?

20:19.130 --> 20:20.790
Now do me another favor.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.680
Stand up and put your
hands behind your back.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.310
All right,we can't stay long.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.710
Denise don't like entertaining visitors.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.300
Very busy woman.

20:34.390 --> 20:35.610
really?What does she do?

20:35.750 --> 20:41.470
Besides waking up in the middle of the
night screaming,"how did I get here?"

20:42.950 --> 20:47.670
ray?You must be annie.

20:47.900 --> 20:51.620
Please excuse the mess.I
haven't had time to vacuum today.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.690
No,I'm sorry to interrupt
your day like this.

20:53.780 --> 20:56.670
- We just-- no,no,I'm just happy to
finally meet someone from ray's work.

20:56.740 --> 20:59.730
Can I get you some coffee,some
tea,a root beer float maybe?

20:59.890 --> 21:01.980
- Come here.
- Thank you.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.990
oh,this is lovely.

21:05.790 --> 21:09.230
The councilman signed er the deed
to his condo to you this morning.

21:09.420 --> 21:13.040
Do you still plan on sticking by your
story that you only just met prince today?

21:13.160 --> 21:14.400
We met a few months ago.

21:14.590 --> 21:17.380
He was my regular tuesday
and thursday client.

21:17.470 --> 21:20.280
Twice a week,huh?That's more
than most married couples.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.580
He didn't want what my
other clients wanted.

21:22.690 --> 21:24.460
He was a gentleman.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.560
He just needed someone to talk to.

21:26.720 --> 21:31.190
Do you have any idea where the
councilman was... was planning on moving?

21:31.260 --> 21:33.670
Sure,I do.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.150
Where?

21:36.320 --> 21:40.480
Somewhere... over the rainbow,of course.

21:46.240 --> 21:53.190
where troubles melt like lemon
drops... away above the chimney tops.

21:53.350 --> 21:56.700
That's where you'll find me.

21:57.790 --> 21:59.800
bobby insisted on
giving the condo to me.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.510
I didn't want anything from him.

22:05.390 --> 22:08.720
Wh-- what did you
just say to me?

22:12.750 --> 22:14.900
Phones must be o again at the precinct.

22:15.020 --> 22:17.150
I can't get through.

22:17.710 --> 22:21.850
Oh,you look gorgeous.

22:22.030 --> 22:23.860
Oh,it's the dress that's gorgeous.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.780
- Where did you get it?
- I ma iT.

22:26.860 --> 22:29.210
I do a little sewing in my spare
time.Justomething I picked up.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.260
What?You--you put a piece of string
through a needle,you call that a hobby?

22:32.350 --> 22:34.330
- I'll never understand it.
- Ray.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.520
I gotta tell you,annie,I'm
absolutely in love with your haircut.

22:36.640 --> 22:39.430
- I've been wanting to chop this off,but,uh...
- no,what?

22:39.590 --> 22:40.670
We've been through this.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.130
Long hair is a gift.Not
everybody can pull that off.

22:43.130 --> 22:45.330
Why would you want to lop off a gift?

22:45.330 --> 22:48.570
Well,I think short hair would suit you.

22:48.680 --> 22:51.190
Ray thinks cutting your hair is
a signature of the modern woman

22:51.250 --> 22:54.140
and the end of
civilization as he knows it.

22:54.380 --> 22:57.300
And just what's so terrible
about a liberated woman?

22:57.370 --> 23:00.850
Nothing at all,as long as
there's a fence around 'em.

23:02.750 --> 23:07.250
All right,better get going,leave
denise to fix some supper.

23:07.370 --> 23:10.430
Nothing I love more than coming
home to a pork chop on the table

23:10.800 --> 23:14.100
and a pilsner in a frosted glass.

23:14.130 --> 23:17.330
Every man's day ended that
way,we would have no war.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.410
Although the peace would
be a little tough to take.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.060
You see?

23:22.270 --> 23:23.640
Now that's why you got no man,norris.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.280
Ray,that's not nice.

23:25.340 --> 23:27.550
I'm just sayin'.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.750
Denise,it was really lovely to meet you.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.650
- You should think about...
- yeah,yeah!

23:33.790 --> 23:35.470
Enough,norris.We gotta go.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.740
All right.ByE.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.090
Hope to see you again soon,annie.

23:49.430 --> 23:51.620
I think you know more
than you're letting on.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.920
Bobby didn't talk much about where
he was going or where he was from,

23:54.010 --> 23:58.420
but I know he missed
home,wherever that was.

23:58.570 --> 24:01.940
Said he didn't really feel
like he had one anymore--

24:02.040 --> 24:06.220
not one to call his own,at
least,and I could relate.

24:07.230 --> 24:13.490
Though I'm sure you  worthless pigs
uldn't understand a thing like that.

24:14.560 --> 24:17.810
I know you're probably used to
being in compromising positions,

24:17.850 --> 24:21.830
miss kastin,but let me tell you,shooting
your mouth off ain't gonna help you any.

24:22.010 --> 24:25.750
There was nothing he hated
more than corrupt cops,

24:25.870 --> 24:29.120
and there's nothing those meat
eaters hated more than bobby.

24:29.300 --> 24:34.760
They started to suspect him of
sniffing around their dirty dealings.

24:34.840 --> 24:38.700
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
he died in pice custody.

24:38.790 --> 24:45.090
Need I remind you he wouldn't have even been here
unless he had met you for some early morning mating.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.990
Tweet.

24:48.110 --> 24:51.490
it's not your time yet,sam.

24:51.730 --> 24:57.160
it's not your time to go home.The
bluebirds ain't flyin' yet-- not for you.

24:57.530 --> 25:00.390
You still have work to do.

25:00.670 --> 25:03.930
That all are free... when it's your
time to go,we will let you know.

25:04.050 --> 25:06.680
Your time will come.

25:12.290 --> 25:13.900
when?

25:18.180 --> 25:20.170
When will I get to go home?

25:21.110 --> 25:22.770
Just as soon as one of these nuts crack.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.390
Then we all get to go home.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.490
Let's go,hooker.

25:38.490 --> 25:40.880
guess our mystery man's running late.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.350
Denise seems real sweet.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.390
She's a peachamaroot.

25:47.050 --> 25:49.430
Not at all what I expected.

25:49.730 --> 25:55.010
I read somewhere that males are often
attracted to their female equivalents.

25:55.460 --> 25:57.490
am i not sweet?

25:57.670 --> 25:59.940
I think I'm sweet.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.130
what?

26:01.220 --> 26:03.150
She never wants for nothing.

26:03.190 --> 26:06.260
Once a year I take her and her
nasty mother down to cocoa beach.

26:06.420 --> 26:10.370
For her last birthday,I got us two tickets
to go see dean martin in atlantic city.

26:10.450 --> 26:13.440
- She likes dean martin?
- No,but I do.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.640
That must be him.

26:16.920 --> 26:20.020
Wait,wait!Sue said that only she
was supposed to be at the meeting.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.060
If you go,too,he might
suspect something.

26:22.220 --> 26:26.000
There is no way I'm letting
you handle this on your own.

26:42.420 --> 26:44.250
good afternoon,sir.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.270
I believe you have
something for my boss?

26:47.380 --> 26:51.600
When we spoke,I didn't realize
you'd be bringing a friend,sue.

26:51.980 --> 26:53.790
This is my brother tony.

26:53.790 --> 26:56.760
He's just a little overprotective.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.710
Can you give us a minute,tony?

27:01.840 --> 27:04.460
Yeah,sure.

27:05.890 --> 27:11.820
I trust you'll maksure that
this makes its way to mr.Prince?

27:12.530 --> 27:14.050
Of course.

27:14.970 --> 27:18.790
Is there a message to go along with it?

27:19.110 --> 27:26.910
Tell him that I said
good-bye... and safe travels.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.020
If what elena says is true,the councilman
could have been taken out by someone

27:48.210 --> 27:51.450
who wanted to keep him from
investigating corruption.

27:53.660 --> 27:57.510
You know?Do any of these cops have
any,um,debts you know about or,

27:57.610 --> 28:00.970
uh,gambling problems or skeletons?

28:02.910 --> 28:08.400
When maria was 6 I bought her a
brand-new hopalong cassidy lunchbox

28:08.560 --> 28:14.980
because she insisted there was
a monster living in her old one.

28:17.670 --> 28:23.600
A few years later,I played hooky and took
her to the bronx zoo for her birthday.

28:25.730 --> 28:30.600
But she'll never remember any of
those thing alshe remembers is that

28:30.710 --> 28:35.770
I got her middle initial wrong
on some silly graduation pen.

28:37.900 --> 28:44.640
- Gene,I,uh...
- you can speculate on the whys and hows all you want,tyler.

28:44.820 --> 28:49.090
But the fact I our killer
could be one of our own.

28:49.220 --> 28:55.280
And there's no greater betrayal...
when it's your own family.

29:00.650 --> 29:05.590
I,um... I didn't kno

29:17.480 --> 29:21.910
I believe you,detective.You're
a good kid.

29:22.060 --> 29:27.290
And you know what day it
is... most of the time.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.370
You should talk to her.

29:31.370 --> 29:35.600
I'm not angry at you,tyler,but that doesn't
give you the right to play "dear abby" here.

29:44.840 --> 29:48.520
could one of these cops be the soter?

29:50.150 --> 29:56.970
if that's the case... I think I
got a way to flush this snake out.

30:02.910 --> 30:05.070
This ain't "the mod squad," no-nuts.

30:05.260 --> 30:08.090
We don't play games,and w

31:06.630 --> 31:09.640
are you gonna do... take away my dolls?

31:10.500 --> 31:13.140
I can't watch "my
three sons" for a month?

31:15.110 --> 31:19.520
We're so mad at each other,you and me...

31:20.070 --> 31:22.100
have been for as long as I know.

31:24.370 --> 31:27.430
You know the first time you told
me you loved me,I was 19 years old?

31:27.520 --> 31:28.500
That's not true.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.530
Do you remember?

31:30.600 --> 31:34.410
How I came home from school special,and
I-I asked you to go for a walk,

31:34.510 --> 31:39.140
and after 20 minutes of...
tryin' to get out of that walk,

31:39.220 --> 31:43.150
you came with me,and I said to
you,"tell me that you love me.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.990
"I need you to tell me that you love me.

31:45.050 --> 31:48.350
I need you so bad to
tell me that you love me.

31:48.420 --> 31:50.720
" Do you remember?

31:51.510 --> 31:54.890
And finally... you did.

31:56.190 --> 32:02.220
After... two whole hours after
I cried myself dry,you grunted it.

32:02.290 --> 32:07.320
You grunted it and patted me
on the shoulder.Do you remember?

32:07.710 --> 32:09.500
That's not the first time I've told you.

32:09.540 --> 32:10.750
Yes,it was.

32:10.830 --> 32:14.590
The first time I told you was when
caroline feffer called you "stupid stork"

32:14.630 --> 32:16.290
'cause you were taller
than the other girls.

32:16.380 --> 32:20.030
I was in the first grade
with caroline feffer.

32:20.070 --> 32:22.980
Yeah,so?

32:25.020 --> 32:29.570
******

32:29.570 --> 32:30.780
I was 6 years old.

32:30.830 --> 32:32.440
Of course I don't remember that.

32:32.490 --> 32:35.400
Well,I do.

32:40.690 --> 32:42.110
hey,what did I just say?

32:42.510 --> 32:43.790
Excuse me.

32:44.340 --> 32:45.060
What did I tell you?Don't talk to her!

32:45.160 --> 32:46.220
- What do you say,doll?
- No,thank you.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.880
Son of a bitch!I told
you don't talk to her!

32:47.960 --> 32:50.080
- What did I tell you?
- I said don't talk to her!

32:50.180 --> 32:53.390
- Help!Help!Somebody help!
- What did I say?!What did I say?!

32:53.510 --> 32:54.390
- Wait a sec!
- Okay!Okay,hey!

32:54.390 --> 32:56.550
- Help!
- Hey,okay,wait!

32:56.750 --> 32:59.860
You learn how to do
that on the farm,russell?

33:04.140 --> 33:05.470
I saw it on tv.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.560
'Cause that's the first thing they
teach you to do at the academy.

33:08.910 --> 33:13.520
I knew if a fight happened to break out in this
room,certain things would come naturally to a cop.

33:27.480 --> 33:28.400
You don't want to do that.

33:28.470 --> 33:29.580
- Russell!
- Russell,let her go.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.180
You know the second thing
they teach you in the academy?

33:31.280 --> 33:33.140
How to conceal a weapon.

33:33.190 --> 33:34.220
Don't be stupid!

33:34.360 --> 33:34.970
Lower your weapons.

33:35.020 --> 33:37.550
All right,drop-- drop
the knife,russell.

33:37.600 --> 33:39.800
Let's talk about this,you
and me,cop to cop.

33:39.850 --> 33:42.010
I didn't want to murder anybody.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.630
But when prince got pinched,I
didn't have a choice.

33:44.660 --> 33:47.610
Down!I knew he was gonnspill
about what he had on me.

33:47.690 --> 33:51.450
Whatever reason you had to murder the
councilman,I'm sure it was a good one.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.200
And,you,down!Down!

33:53.260 --> 33:56.440
And now you're about to murder this
girl in cold blood for no good reason.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.680
What's that gonna get you?

34:04.690 --> 34:08.020
You don't really want to kill
another innocent person today.

34:08.090 --> 34:09.889
You think the councilman was innocent?

34:09.969 --> 34:11.659
I gave 16 years of my life to this job.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.830
He was gonna put me
away for twice that long,

34:13.889 --> 34:17.500
when all I did was do this city a
favor by shaking down a few lowlife,

34:17.610 --> 34:20.760
filthy drug dealers--
the dregs of society.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.540
- please.
- Don't you worry,maria.

34:22.590 --> 34:24.370
He's not gonna hurt you.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.960
He knows better than to hurt yoU.

34:27.159 --> 34:29.230
Don't you know better than to hurt her?

34:29.320 --> 34:31.750
Things were a certain way in
this city before prince arrived.

34:31.800 --> 34:36.159
Then he tried to change
things,make them his way.

34:37.050 --> 34:39.070
Drop your weapons!

34:46.030 --> 34:48.510
Release her,you son of a bitch.

34:56.100 --> 34:57.460
you see that?

34:57.600 --> 35:01.040
- nice.
- Annie.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.980
thank you.

35:07.310 --> 35:09.170
all right,I'll secure it.

35:19.800 --> 35:21.650
well done,nnie.

35:21.720 --> 35:25.560
Guess your new nickname should
be,um,"no-nonsense norris," huh?

35:25.870 --> 35:28.940
I know.I'm an idiot.I'm only here
to keep your girlfriends safe.

35:30.170 --> 35:35.390
The only thing in the briefcase,aside
from the file,was this postcard.

35:39.330 --> 35:42.400
I guess I'll never know if the
counciln knew the way home or not.

35:43.210 --> 35:45.170
He was confused,sam.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.230
- Deeply troubled.
- I know.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.770
But a part of me was
hoping that he wasn't crazy

35:52.430 --> 35:56.680
,that he could actually
help me... find the way home.

35:58.040 --> 36:03.700
You can always... click your heels
together three times and say...

36:05.890 --> 36:07.030
yeah.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.480
he never made it home.

36:15.630 --> 36:20.040
He came so close,but he never made it.

36:20.460 --> 36:23.590
I hope you have better luck.

36:25.480 --> 36:31.650
Yeah,well,you see,I don't know
if you really just said that...

36:35.050 --> 36:36.940
or if I imagined it.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.110
I said it.

36:39.160 --> 36:41.030
And you imagined it.

37:05.410 --> 37:06.350
you okay?

37:06.430 --> 37:08.290
I am.

37:09.370 --> 37:12.890
Of course,I wish I'd never gotten
mixed up in all this in the first place.

37:13.460 --> 37:17.870
Ll,you couldn't have known when you walked in here
this morning that you'd end the day held at knifepoint.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.050
I'm not talking about the lockdown,sam.

37:22.280 --> 37:26.480
Oh,right.Right.

37:26.660 --> 37:28.800
Don't look so aggrieved.

37:30.570 --> 37:33.400
It's like what,uh,dorothy
says in "the wizard of oz.

37:33.450 --> 37:35.360
" "There's no place like home.

37:36.400 --> 37:41.470
" "If you want to find your heart's
desire,look no further than your own backyard.

37:42.980 --> 37:44.850
" What do you mean?

37:49.620 --> 37:50.840
annie?

37:50.960 --> 37:52.810
No!No,no,we're friends.

37:52.930 --> 37:57.310
God made you cute,but  also made
you a little dense,didn't he?

37:59.520 --> 38:01.470
I'll see you around,detective.

38:01.470 --> 38:03.780
Wait,that's--that's
it?

38:04.580 --> 38:06.750
We'll always have the file room.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.500
you sure you don't want to
get checked out by a doctor?

38:20.620 --> 38:22.310
No,I'm fine.

38:24.730 --> 38:25.490
Good night,gene.

38:25.560 --> 38:31.090
You know,I was thinking,you've been
calling me by my first name since forever.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.930
Why don't you try "dad"
just once,see how it feels?

38:34.020 --> 38:36.520
Why don't you try dad just once?

38:36.970 --> 38:39.110
I will if you will.

38:41.940 --> 38:45.850
Maybe someday,but,uh... not today.

38:49.210 --> 38:50.830
I'll see you around,gene.

38:51.060 --> 38:52.840
See you around.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.520
ray.

38:58.690 --> 39:02.150
thank denise for letting
me borrow her dress.

39:06.390 --> 39:07.570
good night,ray.

39:07.630 --> 39:09.030
You're feeling good,aren't you?

39:10.000 --> 39:11.330
Smug.

39:13.110 --> 39:14.510
you had
quite a day--

39:14.600 --> 39:18.560
got to play detective,a
little interrogation,

39:18.620 --> 39:21.790
a little undercover,a little
saving the boss' daughter.

39:21.890 --> 39:23.990
A little saving your silly ass.

39:24.150 --> 39:30.290
It don't matter what you
do,don't matter what happens,

39:30.410 --> 39:35.770
you will always  be no-nuts
norris-- the one that don't belong,

39:35.940 --> 39:39.280
the novelty,the party favor.

39:40.500 --> 39:43.230
capisce'ing me?

39:43.850 --> 39:45.390
okay.

39:45.790 --> 39:47.400
Fine.

39:48.160 --> 39:51.030
But you do have to
ask yourself,ray--

39:51.130 --> 39:57.520
just what is it about me that
scares you... so damn much?

40:20.900 --> 40:22.520
Which one are you?

40:28.570 --> 40:30.310
all three.

40:35.330 --> 40:39.050
Look... I was thinking,boss,

40:40.980 --> 40:45.080
um... I know that having me
here can be... difficult for ya.

40:47.660 --> 40:49.840
What if I wanted to go back?

40:51.680 --> 40:53.760
To hyde?

40:55.720 --> 40:58.140
Is that possible?

40:59.410 --> 41:01.740
I'll get them on the horn right now.

41:02.930 --> 41:03.690
you mean you can do that?

41:03.780 --> 41:07.360
You can just send me
back to where I came from?

41:08.370 --> 41:10.230
Yeah.

41:14.500 --> 41:15.930
hello.

41:16.050 --> 41:18.490
Is this is wizard of oz?

41:20.930 --> 41:25.690
The wizard will sort it out because
of the wonderful things he does.

41:32.720 --> 41:35.580
You were transferred
here at your own request.

41:37.540 --> 41:39.590
I didn't ask for you.

41:42.290 --> 41:44.330
you wanted to come.
