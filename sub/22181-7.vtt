WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:02.603
[Kara]
Previously on Supergirl...

00:02.636 --> 00:05.206
[Myr'nn] So, what do
we do now?

00:06.207 --> 00:07.208
[Hank Henshaw]
We go home, Father.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.079
[Ruby] Do you know
how many people in this world

00:11.112 --> 00:12.546
want to have super powers?

00:12.680 --> 00:15.549
[Sam] I need you to hear me,
I don't have powers.

00:22.823 --> 00:25.259
The waterfront explosion
still affects another
mile radius.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.027
We should keep patrolling
for damage.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.816
What the...

00:56.124 --> 00:57.558
[alarm beeps]

01:08.269 --> 01:10.271
[Ruby] Mom, are you okay?

01:12.773 --> 01:14.342
Yeah. Yeah, babe, I'm fine.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.078
You wanna set the table?
This won't take long to cook.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.080
Sure.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.209
Mom?

01:49.343 --> 01:51.245
Can I watch a movie tonight
if I finish my homework?

01:52.746 --> 01:53.814
Um...

01:54.248 --> 01:55.349
You know what, I just...

01:56.417 --> 01:58.118
realized I have to
go back to work for something.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.321
Can you go over
to Tess' for dinner tonight?

02:00.354 --> 02:01.489
Mom, do I have to?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.591
Ruby, this is not a discussion.
You're going to Tess'.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.629
Okay.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.414
Hey. Hi, Mr. J.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.382
You, uh,
looking for something?

02:29.350 --> 02:31.352
I would like to find
the b'rahh alcom.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.355
Oh! Oh.
You know, I've been brushing up
on my Martian, b'rahh.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.657
Library! No.

02:36.924 --> 02:37.925
Bathroom.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.360
To relieve myself.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.395
You don't know where it is?

02:43.831 --> 02:47.301
Haven't you been here
for like three weeks?

02:47.768 --> 02:48.902
And four days.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.171
Precisely.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.607
Yeah, it's down the hall,

02:54.575 --> 02:55.743
around the corner,
third door to your left.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.345
We really should put up signs.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.879
May I go?

03:00.848 --> 03:02.450
-Yeah.
-Thank you!

03:04.985 --> 03:06.387
Okay.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.789
Shut down those systems
so there's no possibility
of infiltration.

03:08.989 --> 03:12.893
Um, boss. Hey,
can I chat with you
for like a hot sec?

03:13.861 --> 03:14.762
A hot sec?

03:14.795 --> 03:17.665
Oh, my God. Never mind.
Listen, your dad

03:17.698 --> 03:20.334
just asked me
for permission to use
the bathroom.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.937
Yeah, well, he's still
getting used to things
around here.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.275
Sure. But it was kinda
like the way he said it.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.678
Like he was a prisoner
or something.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.447
Well, he was a prisoner
for over 300 years.

03:33.714 --> 03:37.217
Exactly why I think that
you might wanna take him out.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.688
Like into the non-DEO world.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.759
I run a complex and
highly sensitive government
operation here.

03:45.793 --> 03:46.794
Yeah, yeah, fine.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.230
Winn?

03:51.465 --> 03:53.734
-I got your message.
-Yes. Yes. Of course.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.870
So, I'm not really
quite sure what to make of it,

03:56.904 --> 03:57.938
but I thought
you guys should see this.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.240
This is an incident
that happened this morning.

04:00.808 --> 04:01.809
What is it?

04:02.776 --> 04:03.844
So, the city sent out
an exploratory team

04:03.877 --> 04:06.847
to investigate the effects
of the submarine attack,

04:07.481 --> 04:11.452
and you can see that they
found something strange
in the bedrock,

04:11.485 --> 04:12.853
so they went to check it out.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.722
And...

04:14.755 --> 04:16.824
It got attacked.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.460
Yep. I mean, luckily,
their emergency systems
kicked in

04:19.493 --> 04:21.762
and they made it
to the surface,
but they could have

04:21.795 --> 04:23.964
easily just been taken out.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.265
What else can you find out?

04:25.499 --> 04:28.369
Oh!
The USGS geothermal scans,

04:28.402 --> 04:30.938
we can pull up one of those
to find these coordinates.

04:34.074 --> 04:37.878
Okay. Well, I can tell you
two things, right off the bat.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.814
One, according to
the rock layers,

04:41.515 --> 04:46.354
that ship has been under there
for about 12,000 years,

04:46.854 --> 04:49.056
and two, whatever metal
it's made out of

04:49.089 --> 04:51.892
is not on the periodic table.

04:57.865 --> 05:01.402
Okay, slow down, slow down.
We're getting close,
we're getting close.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.603
[scanner beeps rapidly]

05:02.636 --> 05:06.340
Wait. No. Hey. Wait, okay.
Ship should be right under us.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.808
-[rapid beeping continues]
-Okay.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.977
All right, stand back.
Everyone, stand back.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.945
-I saw Clark do this once.
-Get back!

05:11.979 --> 05:13.313
Wait, wait, wait.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.983
There's a way of doing this
without destroying
public property.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.751
Let's go.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.320
Oh, man, I wanted to see that.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.456
Awesome.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.460
All right.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.095
What are you doing?

05:28.128 --> 05:29.863
This might feel
a little weird.

05:30.798 --> 05:33.000
[Winn screams] Oh, no!

05:33.534 --> 05:34.835
-Oh, God, that was horrible.
-Shh.

05:34.868 --> 05:35.869
[whispers] That was amazing.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.539
-Can we do that
all the time, please?
-No.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.040
Okay. [exhales]

05:44.478 --> 05:45.579
Is that a person?

05:47.515 --> 05:48.516
[Hank Henshaw] Looks like.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.122
There's an empty one.

05:56.624 --> 05:58.826
Okay, that's not creepy,
not at all.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.128
[whirring]

06:06.900 --> 06:08.536
[grunts] Don't shoot.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.903
[speaking alien language]

06:10.070 --> 06:11.505
We're not here to hurt you.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.613
Kara.

06:30.958 --> 06:31.959
[shudders]

06:34.895 --> 06:35.896
[sniffles]

06:36.229 --> 06:38.432
[theme music playing]

06:50.944 --> 06:51.945
My God.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.581
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.549
-It's Mon-El.
-I know.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.118
You're back.

06:59.386 --> 07:02.222
Wait a minute,
how are you breathing?
How is he breathing?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.624
We don't know.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.526
According to the samples
taken this morning,

07:05.559 --> 07:07.628
the air should still be
toxic to Daxamites.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.162
It's incredible.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.231
Did someone cure you?

07:11.264 --> 07:13.934
Yeah, and what was that
language you were speaking
on the ship?

07:14.535 --> 07:15.536
Saturnian.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.506
But there's life on Saturn?

07:18.539 --> 07:21.108
Why did you fire
on the divers
in that submersible?

07:21.141 --> 07:22.142
I didn't.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.913
I heard the ship's
defense system activate though.

07:25.946 --> 07:26.780
Is everyone okay?

07:26.814 --> 07:28.549
Yeah, they got
out of there in time.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.017
That's some ship
you got there.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.519
I've never seen
anything like it.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.122
It's, uh... It's alien.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.692
Who's in the other chambers?

07:39.259 --> 07:40.460
Just passengers.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.896
-Are they dangerous?
-No.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.633
No, they're, um...
They're like me.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.969
Why did you wake up
and everybody else
is still asleep?

07:49.603 --> 07:53.006
I'm sorry, guys,
I was in hypersleep,
and it's all, um...

07:53.273 --> 07:55.108
It's all very hazy right now,
so...

07:55.142 --> 07:57.110
So you don't remember anything
about the other passengers?

07:57.144 --> 07:59.179
There will be
plenty of time
to ask questions.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.148
He really needs to rest.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.017
-Come on.
-Right. Good to see you, buddy.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.719
Yeah. It's great to have
you back.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.155
-I look forward
to our debriefing.
-Enough.

08:09.757 --> 08:10.691
[chuckles]

08:17.998 --> 08:19.099
I missed you.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.003
Me too.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.574
It's been...

08:28.275 --> 08:29.276
Tough.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.613
Seven months of not knowing.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.549
Seven months?

08:39.052 --> 08:40.654
I tried to send a message...

08:42.590 --> 08:45.292
so many times, to tell you
I was okay, but I couldn't.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.561
-I tried.
-It's okay.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.033
You can tell me
all about what happened later.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.670
-Kara--
-Shh.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.139
-No, Kara--
-Just sleep.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.006
[Patricia] Coming.

09:41.749 --> 09:42.783
Hi, Patricia.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.031
So, it's just you?

09:58.398 --> 09:59.833
You didn't bring, uh...

10:02.235 --> 10:03.303
Ruby?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.508
I've never met the girl.

10:08.541 --> 10:12.145
So, I don't think you should
expect me to keep
her name straight.

10:12.345 --> 10:16.216
Well, you kicked me out
for having her, I didn't
think you'd wanna meet her.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.686
No, you made your choice.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.288
You had to know that
there would be consequences.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.657
-I was a kid.
-You know as well as anyone

10:23.691 --> 10:26.727
that the moment
you become pregnant,
you're not a kid anymore.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.662
So I didn't deserve
a support system?

10:30.463 --> 10:33.333
Married adults have
children all the time,
they need their parents.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.268
I would have
just been a crutch for you.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.336
You were my mother.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.405
And I always wanted
what was best for you.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.340
So you just let me leave?

10:40.874 --> 10:43.310
That's not what I wanted
to have happen at all.

10:43.777 --> 10:44.812
[exhales deeply]

10:45.879 --> 10:48.148
Do you know how hard
it was for me to come here?

10:49.482 --> 10:52.252
-Well, then why did you?
-You're unbelievable.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.125
Some things
have been happening.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.659
What things?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.897
I guess I was
just wondering if,

11:06.466 --> 11:07.835
growing up,

11:08.869 --> 11:10.237
if I ever did anything strange.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.172
What do you mean by "strange"?

11:13.306 --> 11:16.409
I don't know. Did I fall?
Like, fall and not get hurt?

11:16.443 --> 11:19.246
Did I ever
lift anything really heavy?

11:19.279 --> 11:21.148
No. No, nothing like that.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.682
-Nothing?
-No.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.355
Okay. Uh...

11:30.357 --> 11:32.459
Well, maybe you could help me

11:32.492 --> 11:34.461
find something out
about my birth mother.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.229
Well, why do you
wanna know about her?

11:40.533 --> 11:41.735
You know what,

11:42.435 --> 11:43.703
just forget it.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.438
Sorry I bothered you.

11:51.511 --> 11:52.980
I was at a press event.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.719
Someone had a gun.
They fired it into the crowd.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.856
A lot of people got hurt.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.425
I got home,

12:06.794 --> 12:08.862
and I found a hole in my coat.

12:12.199 --> 12:15.735
Found a little piece of metal,
a bullet.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.205
It was completely flattened.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.309
I got shot

12:22.542 --> 12:24.978
and it didn't
puncture my skin.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.883
I got shot
and I didn't feel it.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.320
How could I not feel it?

12:34.988 --> 12:36.189
Patricia,

12:36.924 --> 12:39.326
what is happening?

12:42.562 --> 12:43.763
Follow me.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.870
You ask about your birth mom.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.805
I lied.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.276
I didn't adopt you.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.480
I found you. In this.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.485
I...

13:40.253 --> 13:42.055
I just... I don't understand.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.456
No, I didn't either.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.426
I didn't know
where you were from,

13:46.459 --> 13:50.397
or who left you in this thing
or why.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.834
And you just...
You looked
so damned helpless...

13:57.905 --> 13:59.006
that I took you home.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.846
Were you ever gonna tell me?

14:07.080 --> 14:09.449
I swore that I would tell you
when you turned 18,

14:10.117 --> 14:11.518
but you were gone by then.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.522
And I thought,
well, maybe that's better.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.590
That you would be better off

14:17.991 --> 14:20.627
out there on your own
without knowing.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.429
That I'm an alien?

14:22.462 --> 14:27.067
Sam... I just wanted you
to have a normal life.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.381
[powering up]

15:20.320 --> 15:21.521
It's unreal.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.457
I still can't believe
he's here.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.492
[Kara] Yeah.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.428
Not so sure
about the beard, though.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.330
I kinda like it.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.500
Hey, I'm really happy
for you.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.436
Yeah.

15:38.638 --> 15:39.639
Yeah.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.343
Yeah, he's been a little...

15:44.644 --> 15:46.279
A little distant.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.315
I don't know.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.251
Yeah, but you never know
what he's been through,
you know?

15:52.319 --> 15:53.486
Maybe just give him
a little time.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.459
You know,
I watched you two last year.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.962
I've never seen you more happy.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.634
And I know that he would never
do anything to hurt you.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.348
All right, Rubes,
Mrs. Qualar is coming to stay.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.549
For how long?

16:22.582 --> 16:24.584
I'm not sure yet,
but I do know that
you hate her cooking,

16:24.617 --> 16:26.519
so I'm leaving money
for takeout.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.388
Right here.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.756
Where are you going?

16:29.789 --> 16:31.558
I'm not exactly sure yet.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.661
Hey.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.397
You don't have to worry.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.133
Okay? Nothing is wrong.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.004
I'm sorry I yelled
at you earlier.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.607
I found something out.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.743
About myself.
And it's a really good thing.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.381
It's gonna answer
a lot of questions,

16:54.414 --> 16:56.649
but I gotta take this trip
to get those
questions answered.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.685
Can't I come with you?
I can come with you.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.321
I know you want to,
and I wish that you could,

17:01.588 --> 17:03.323
but I gotta do this
on my own, okay?

17:05.525 --> 17:06.559
Hold my hand.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.397
You feel that?

17:10.697 --> 17:11.698
Your pulse?

17:12.399 --> 17:13.400
That's you.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.068
You are my heart.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.037
Are you gonna trust me?

17:20.373 --> 17:22.575
Something wonderful
is happening.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.147
Just promise to tell me
about it when you come back.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.715
I promise.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.384
I love you so much.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.052
I love you, too.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.424
Hey, so now that we know
it's just friendly ol' Mon-El
in the ship,

17:37.457 --> 17:40.360
maybe you could finally
go have that outing
with your dad.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.562
We have to learn
more about the ship
Mon-El was on.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.797
There are five other passengers
on board we know nothing about.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.466
They're literally asleep.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.867
The ship is secure, okay?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.636
We're running comms on it
to find its origin,

17:49.669 --> 17:51.704
we're monitoring it
in case anybody else wakes up.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.573
I will alert you
if anything happens.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.175
Yes, leave us in charge.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.710
And by "us," I mean Alex,

17:57.744 --> 18:01.648
because I should not
be in charge of anything.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.451
Just go be with your dad.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.563
This brown water
is a popular beverage on Earth?

18:16.896 --> 18:18.465
In the mornings mostly.

18:21.668 --> 18:22.635
Mmm.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.637
Yes.

18:25.238 --> 18:29.176
I understand the appeal
of c'of-fee.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.511
It's pronounced "coffee."

18:32.979 --> 18:35.782
It's only a short walk
from the DEO. You can come
down here any time.

18:38.885 --> 18:39.886
What is that?

18:41.654 --> 18:42.789
A duel of intellect?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.591
That is chess.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.826
An ancient game of strategy
with infinite outcomes.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.661
Ah!

18:48.861 --> 18:51.130
Much like o'kk rotokk.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.234
We should play o'kk rotokk
sometime.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.438
I don't really have
a lot of time for games,

18:58.471 --> 19:01.441
but you should come down here,
learn chess.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.148
If you wish to return
to the DEO, let us go.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.818
Oh, no, Father, it's okay,
it's okay. We can stay out.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.622
You've been a prisoner
for 300 years,

19:15.922 --> 19:17.690
you shouldn't feel
like a prisoner here.

19:17.724 --> 19:21.160
I know I am not
a prisoner of the DEO, my son.

19:21.828 --> 19:22.829
You are.

19:24.130 --> 19:27.567
You have glanced at your
smart devices 43 times
since we arrived.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.736
Your body is here,

19:30.270 --> 19:33.573
but your mind
is trapped in your work.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.576
You live there,
your only friends are there,

19:36.609 --> 19:37.777
you have nothing outside of it.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.280
You've been here three weeks,
I've been here 300 years.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.582
I think I know
a little more about

19:42.615 --> 19:44.183
how to engage
with this world than you do.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.588
Thank you
for showing me the way here.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.957
I will return
if I require more brown water.

19:50.990 --> 19:54.193
-Father, come on--
-You have completed
your mission,

19:54.494 --> 19:56.763
and now I would like
to return to my room.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.802
[woman] I'm on my way.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.896
Hey, you shouldn't be in here.
[grunts]

21:07.934 --> 21:08.935
[man groans]

21:37.764 --> 21:38.965
I don't understand.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.769
I wanna give you
the benefit of the doubt,

21:42.802 --> 21:45.738
but you attacked two agents.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.711
[sighs]

21:55.982 --> 21:56.983
Was...

21:58.685 --> 22:00.853
Were you confused
by the hypersleep?

22:01.988 --> 22:04.791
Is that why you
snuck out of the med bay,

22:05.558 --> 22:08.461
broke into a secure
storage room and almost killed
two people?

22:08.495 --> 22:09.762
I didn't almost kill anyone.

22:18.638 --> 22:19.806
Is it not you?

22:21.674 --> 22:22.675
It's me.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.979
Then... Then make me
believe it.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.748
Please. [breath trembling]

22:33.686 --> 22:35.021
You know,
I don't sleep anymore.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.859
I lay awake at night
just staring at the ceiling,

22:39.892 --> 22:42.695
because if I close my eyes
I dream about you dying.

22:43.830 --> 22:49.902
[voice breaking] I see you
disappear into the blackness
of space forever.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.741
[sobs]

22:56.543 --> 22:58.144
This was all I wanted.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.048
This.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.784
And when I saw you
on that ship...

23:04.817 --> 23:08.721
[inhales deeply] oh, my God,
I felt like I could hope again.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.624
I could touch you,

23:11.924 --> 23:13.960
and see you and hear you,

23:13.993 --> 23:17.163
and be with you, finally.

23:23.670 --> 23:24.804
But...

23:29.976 --> 23:32.712
you're different.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.089
You have nothing to say?

23:48.695 --> 23:49.696
Nothing?

23:50.963 --> 23:51.964
I'm sorry.

23:57.837 --> 23:58.905
[sighs]

24:00.673 --> 24:02.875
Shame on me for having
a human heart.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.783
What are you doing, Sam?

25:35.101 --> 25:37.069
Okay, you look different.

25:39.138 --> 25:39.939
How are you?

25:40.940 --> 25:42.942
I'm fine, thanks.
I'm better than Kara.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.946
Yeah, I'm assuming that
since you didn't tell her
anything,

25:46.979 --> 25:49.548
you are definitely
not gonna tell me anything,
so...

25:50.883 --> 25:52.218
Still, here I am.
[sighs]

25:54.153 --> 25:55.788
Thought I'd give it a shot.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.100
I know something's going on.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.038
Oh, yeah, that alien ship.
[scoffs]

26:14.774 --> 26:16.743
That's not
just any alien ship, is it?

26:16.776 --> 26:18.745
There's a lot
that you don't understand,
okay? It's...

26:19.979 --> 26:21.313
-It's different now.
-Different, how?

26:21.347 --> 26:24.917
It's just different! Okay?

26:29.989 --> 26:30.990
There's a lot...

26:32.191 --> 26:34.861
There's a lot to explain here,
okay? I acknowledge that.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.900
And I'm sorry, Winn,
but I need you
as a friend right now.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.103
I need you to believe me.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.007
And I need your help
to get back to that ship.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.341
[scoffs]

26:50.877 --> 26:51.644
[exhales]

26:51.678 --> 26:53.379
People will get hurt
if I don't.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.148
Kara will get hurt.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.152
Please.

27:18.370 --> 27:19.872
[exhales sharply]

27:26.312 --> 27:27.814
[whirring]

27:28.347 --> 27:29.348
[Winn] Oh. Oh.

27:29.882 --> 27:30.883
Come on, come on.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.318
I think it's working.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.888
Okay, the stasis fluid levels
are okay. How's the power?

27:36.322 --> 27:38.057
Are you sure this is safe?

27:38.224 --> 27:40.092
Crief, the therian pump
is jammed.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.862
-I don't know what that means.
-Okay.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.897
Just reset the circuit
on the end of the first pod.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.399
Winn, you okay?

27:47.433 --> 27:48.434
Um...

27:50.937 --> 27:51.938
He's fine.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.874
He's... I just made him
help me.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.108
-You kidnapped him.
-I didn't--

27:56.142 --> 27:57.209
He didn't kidnap me.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.445
Listen, we only have
your best interests at heart.

27:59.478 --> 28:04.183
So, which of you two
is deciding what my
best interests are?

28:05.852 --> 28:06.853
[Mon-El sighs]

28:07.887 --> 28:11.190
Good. I'm taking that and you
back to the DEO.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.692
-I... I can't let you.
-Get out of my way!

28:21.901 --> 28:22.735
My necklace.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.472
Why'd you have to
come down here, anyway?

28:28.440 --> 28:31.210
If we hadn't come here,
you would have died.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.145
It doesn't matter,
I'm not your problem anymore.

28:33.345 --> 28:37.216
How could you have
changed so much?
It's only been seven months.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.118
No, it's been seven years!

28:43.389 --> 28:48.928
It's been seven months for you,
but it has been
seven years for me

28:48.961 --> 28:50.396
since the day
I went in that pod.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.071
When I left Earth,
I went through
some kind of wormhole.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.108
Kor-El calls it a disruption.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.442
And it took me to the future.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.244
And I've been living on Earth,

29:05.277 --> 29:07.746
in the 31st century,
for the past seven years.

29:09.281 --> 29:12.118
That explains why he's
not allergic to lead anymore.

29:12.151 --> 29:15.988
L-Corp develops a cure
about 400 years from now.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.257
So what? You just...

29:21.160 --> 29:22.361
You just forgot about me?

29:26.298 --> 29:28.034
Why are you
still wearing the necklace?

29:29.301 --> 29:30.402
[beeping]

29:30.436 --> 29:33.472
-No. No, no.
-What? What is it?

29:33.505 --> 29:36.075
The power
to the chambers are failing.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.177
Does that mean
that everybody else
is gonna wake up?

29:38.210 --> 29:40.012
No, it means
they're going to die.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.316
We can reroute the power
to all the chambers except...

29:46.552 --> 29:47.553
[bubbling]

29:47.586 --> 29:48.487
No.

29:49.421 --> 29:50.556
What's wrong?

29:52.158 --> 29:53.259
She's drowning.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.062
[grunts] Damn it.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.231
I can't...

29:59.999 --> 30:01.367
It's white dwarf glass,
I can't...

30:05.337 --> 30:06.472
[Supergirl grunts]

30:13.012 --> 30:15.281
Imra? Imra?

30:17.583 --> 30:18.584
Imra?

30:23.022 --> 30:25.124
She's okay. [panting]

30:25.424 --> 30:26.425
She's breathing.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.381
[device humming]

31:08.534 --> 31:10.236
[rumbling]

31:59.051 --> 32:00.052
Are there any updates?

32:00.619 --> 32:02.088
She's stable for now.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.091
We're still analyzing
her genetic makeup
so we can treat her properly.

32:05.124 --> 32:08.427
I mean, is there anything
you can tell us to help?

32:08.727 --> 32:09.928
She's from Titan.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.132
Without power to the ship
she may have been

32:13.165 --> 32:14.700
off life support
longer than we think.

32:20.539 --> 32:21.540
Who is she?

32:24.376 --> 32:25.377
Her name is Imra.

32:27.113 --> 32:29.148
Winn, will you let me know
if her condition changes?

32:29.715 --> 32:30.949
Yeah, of course.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.659
He's from the future.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.463
Yeah, I can safely say
I was not expecting that.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.100
[Kara sighs]

32:58.544 --> 33:00.512
What are these empty rooms for?

33:01.647 --> 33:04.450
It's not much.

33:05.784 --> 33:08.987
But, um, it's an apartment.

33:09.655 --> 33:10.756
To live in.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.528
I never thought
I'd see you again, Father.

33:18.630 --> 33:19.998
Not after the invasion.

33:21.733 --> 33:25.271
I'd gotten so used to
living here on Earth,
on my own.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.608
Work has always
made me feel productive.

33:30.276 --> 33:31.277
Useful.

33:33.545 --> 33:34.680
But you are so right.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.016
I have isolated myself
in my work.

33:42.254 --> 33:46.158
When I was a child,
you taught me to always see
the beauty in life.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.196
I've lost sight of that
over the years.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.798
Nothing is ever lost for good.

33:54.733 --> 33:57.035
It may not be Mars, but there

33:57.836 --> 34:00.572
is much beauty
to find on this planet.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.174
There is.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.311
I am here for you now, son.

34:05.577 --> 34:06.612
I know.

34:09.848 --> 34:12.484
That's why we're here.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.789
At this apartment?

34:19.658 --> 34:22.728
I thought it might be
a better fit than the DEO.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.231
For both of us.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.568
You shall move here too?

34:30.302 --> 34:33.605
We could make this our... home.

34:34.873 --> 34:36.142
If you'd like.

34:39.678 --> 34:42.214
I would like that very much.

34:56.662 --> 34:57.763
I'm sorry.

35:00.599 --> 35:01.700
For all of this.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.771
I never thought
I'd see you again.

35:06.705 --> 35:07.773
[Kara sighs]

35:09.241 --> 35:10.342
I had to keep living.

35:11.243 --> 35:12.778
You kept the necklace.

35:12.811 --> 35:13.812
Of course I did.

35:15.046 --> 35:18.250
As a reminder of everything
you taught me and did for me.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.321
A reminder of you.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.257
It means a lot.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.363
You have to believe
that no matter what...

35:32.298 --> 35:34.266
What century or universe,

35:34.766 --> 35:37.336
or world I'm living in,
that I would never forget you.

35:38.637 --> 35:39.671
Never.

35:41.273 --> 35:43.242
It was wrong of me
to keep the truth from you.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.677
Well, the truth never hurts
as much as secrets.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.646
Yeah, and I should have
known better.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.250
You've never needed
my protection.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.655
Except for that one time
when we went
for all-you-can-eat ribs.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.624
And you, uh...

35:58.990 --> 36:01.327
You were inhaling those things,
if I remember correctly.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.829
-I swear if hadn't
stopped you...
-It was a limited-time offer.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.699
-I had to.
-[laughing]

36:09.701 --> 36:10.869
That's a good point.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.875
This is the first time
I've seen you smile
since you've been back.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.913
I haven't had a chance
to say it yet, but, uh...

36:27.319 --> 36:28.687
it's really good to see you.

36:30.289 --> 36:31.290
Yeah.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.193
There's something
I have to tell you.

36:37.996 --> 36:39.197
[Imra] Mon-El?

36:42.934 --> 36:43.935
Imra.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.672
Imra.

36:48.774 --> 36:51.610
I'm so glad you're okay.
We thought
your life support failed.

36:51.643 --> 36:54.346
No, I'm fine. Tired, but fine.

36:59.951 --> 37:00.886
Uh...

37:01.920 --> 37:04.222
Imra, this is Kara Danvers.

37:05.357 --> 37:06.492
Supergirl.

37:08.427 --> 37:09.728
I...

37:09.761 --> 37:11.363
I can't believe
it's really you.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.503
Kara, this is Imra Ardeen.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.439
My wife.

38:09.421 --> 38:10.956
[whirring]

38:11.957 --> 38:13.425
[powers up]

38:28.106 --> 38:29.408
You have come.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.444
I imagine you have questions.

38:33.011 --> 38:34.012
I have answers.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.781
I've seen you.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.917
In my dreams.

38:40.852 --> 38:41.987
What are you?

38:42.153 --> 38:43.389
Science.

38:44.122 --> 38:45.323
Magic.

38:45.957 --> 38:46.958
Information.

38:48.827 --> 38:49.861
Your friend.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.832
What is this place?

38:55.133 --> 38:57.102
This is your
Fortress of Sanctuary.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.004
A piece of your world,

38:59.805 --> 39:01.940
the dead planet Krypton.

39:04.843 --> 39:05.977
Oh, my God.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.079
Ruby was right.

39:09.147 --> 39:11.450
She thought I had powers,
and I do.

39:12.818 --> 39:15.120
I always knew
that I was different,
but I always thought

39:15.153 --> 39:17.055
it was because
I was adopted. But...

39:18.990 --> 39:20.091
it wasn't.

39:24.129 --> 39:25.464
[gasps softly]

39:25.497 --> 39:27.065
I'm like Supergirl.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.067
You are so much more
than that.

39:32.838 --> 39:33.905
Who am I?

39:34.906 --> 39:37.042
You are a culmination
of centuries of work,

39:37.943 --> 39:40.078
a being designed
for one purpose,

39:41.179 --> 39:42.848
to execute justice.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.050
I'm a hero?

39:47.085 --> 39:48.887
They will not call you a hero.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.058
They will call you Worldkiller.

39:53.091 --> 39:55.627
They will try to contain
your power, but they will fail.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.930
You will show no mercy
to those who oppose you.

39:59.465 --> 40:02.000
Your justice
will burn the world of man.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.402
No. I'm not

40:05.236 --> 40:06.638
a Worldkiller.

40:07.773 --> 40:11.443
[stammers] I'm not
a Worldkiller.
I have a life. I'm...

40:12.077 --> 40:13.044
[gasping]

40:13.912 --> 40:15.647
I'm a good person.
I have a daughter.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.950
Your offspring
was an unfortunate error.

40:21.086 --> 40:24.089
Your powers were supposed to
manifest when you came of age.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.925
She delayed the realization
of your destiny.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.194
She is not an error!

40:29.227 --> 40:30.662
You will soon forget her.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.566
You will soon forget
all mortal trappings.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.435
No. This can't be right.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.172
It is time for you to emerge.

40:42.674 --> 40:46.578
It is time for you
to become Reign.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.582
[grunting and gasping]

40:51.550 --> 40:53.685
No. No!

40:54.653 --> 40:56.955
[screaming]

40:57.923 --> 41:00.659
No! No!

41:01.259 --> 41:02.460
[groans]

41:04.596 --> 41:06.698
[screaming]

41:11.002 --> 41:12.003
[grunts]

41:14.740 --> 41:15.974
[sighing in relief]

41:37.195 --> 41:38.530
[speaks alien language]

41:48.306 --> 41:50.508
[theme music playing]
