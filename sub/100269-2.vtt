00:22.022 --> 00:25.608
-So, Copper River next week then?
- Sounds good.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.193
-Is that a promise?
-You bet.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.988
All right, fingers crossed.
Tell Theresa I said hi.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.448
Thanks. Will do, Love.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.285
<i> I'm an optimist.</i>

00:36.202 --> 00:38.872
<i>And that, Love, is why I'm gonna say,</i>

00:38.955 --> 00:41.791
<i>"I can't wait</i>
<i>to tell our story to our kids."</i>

00:43.460 --> 00:44.961
<i>I know, it's hardly begun,</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:46.838
<i>but it's how I've always been.</i>

00:47.422 --> 00:50.633
<i>Even as a kid, one glance from a girl</i>

00:50.717 --> 00:53.595
<i>and I was trying out</i>
<i>my last name with hers.</i>

00:54.387 --> 00:55.972
<i>I don't think that's wrong.</i>

00:56.056 --> 01:00.393
<i>I think love should come out of nowhere,</i>
<i>sweep you up completely.</i>

01:00.477 --> 01:04.022
<i>But let's not conflate optimism</i>
<i>with certitude.</i>

01:04.105 --> 01:06.316
<i>I've learned some hard lessons,</i>

01:06.399 --> 01:07.650
<i>fools do rush in.</i>

01:10.403 --> 01:13.156
<i>And I've been the fool more than once.</i>

01:15.408 --> 01:18.328
<i>If I'm honest, I saw red flags</i>

01:18.411 --> 01:19.621
<i>and explained them away.</i>

01:20.288 --> 01:22.332
<i>I wanted love so badly,</i>

01:22.874 --> 01:25.251
<i>which is why I have to see</i>
<i>with clear eyes now.</i>

01:25.335 --> 01:27.087
You know what?
I'm gonna wait for the kings.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.880
- Okay.
-Which is, like, soon?

01:29.339 --> 01:32.675
<i> Find those flags</i>
<i>before we've gone too far.</i>

01:33.760 --> 01:34.677
What's her name?

01:34.761 --> 01:35.804
-Cindy.
-Cindy?

01:35.887 --> 01:38.348
<i> And this isn't to say</i>
<i>I'm not optimistic, so...</i>

01:38.890 --> 01:41.726
<i>our story, I suppose it begins a week ago.</i>

01:44.104 --> 01:47.524
<i>♪ All this time I was trying to find ♪</i>

01:47.607 --> 01:50.902
<i>♪ Some drug to fill this hole ♪</i>

01:51.486 --> 01:55.698
<i>♪ It was my mistake to trust in fate ♪</i>

01:55.824 --> 01:58.952
<i>♪ To show me the way to go ♪</i>

01:59.119 --> 02:00.120
<i> I got here,</i>

02:00.203 --> 02:02.080
<i>and within minutes, I knew...</i>

02:02.580 --> 02:04.999
<i>I'm in a strange land.</i>

02:05.083 --> 02:06.543
<i>Duck-lipped,</i>

02:06.626 --> 02:10.004
<i>stoned, suspiciously happy lemmings</i>
<i>everywhere you look.</i>

02:10.880 --> 02:13.466
<i>This guy, LA in a nutshell:</i>

02:14.050 --> 02:16.469
<i>the Unabomber with a three-picture deal.</i>

02:17.554 --> 02:20.473
<i>Welcome to a city</i>
<i>where people trying to disappear</i>

02:20.557 --> 02:22.392
<i>aren't actually trying.</i>

02:22.475 --> 02:23.685
Can I get a selfie with you?

02:23.768 --> 02:24.769
Yeah, sure.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.146
<i> Poor guy.</i>

02:26.980 --> 02:28.940
<i>-Must really hate all the attention.</i>

02:29.065 --> 02:31.025
-All right, have a good one.
- Hendy, can I get one?

02:31.109 --> 02:32.694
<i> And then there was me,</i>

02:32.777 --> 02:36.739
<i>the one in four million</i>
<i>not wanting to be discovered.</i>

02:45.623 --> 02:46.583
All right.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.043
<i> Step one in my effort...</i>

02:49.502 --> 02:50.628
<i>tacos</i>

02:50.712 --> 02:52.088
<i>with a man with a means</i>

02:52.172 --> 02:55.258
<i>to bring a new, unlocatable me</i>
<i>into existence,</i>

02:55.341 --> 02:59.012
<i>at least according</i>
<i>to his carefully worded ad on Craigslist.</i>

02:59.095 --> 03:04.100
Ever think how basically everything now
is GMO frankenfood?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.019
Like-- like, what exactly

03:06.102 --> 03:08.938
is all of this hacked corn
doing to our epigenetics, right?

03:09.022 --> 03:12.609
<i> Apparently, California's got its</i>
<i>own brand of conspiracy theorists.</i>

03:12.692 --> 03:15.403
<i>Yes, take caution,</i>
<i>lest you have a less-clean liver.</i>

03:15.486 --> 03:18.698
...you can give pigs fresh air
so they don't even <i>need</i> antibiotics.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.366
Just a thought.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.328
-Cages are never the answer.
-Totally, never.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.371
So,
what I need--

03:25.455 --> 03:26.372
I got you.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.208
Get out, no trace.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.544
If I want to leave today, say--
say, to Mexico...

03:32.086 --> 03:33.463
Great choice.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.548
Food's cleaner, cheap,
you'll love living there.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.925
But I can't stay forever.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.343
I have unfinished business here.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.511
But would not recommend a return trip.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.306
<i> Getting out to escape Candace</i>
<i>was imperative,</i>

03:43.389 --> 03:45.767
<i>but so too was the option to return</i>

03:45.850 --> 03:47.685
<i>and actually deal with her</i>
<i>when I was ready.</i>

03:47.769 --> 03:49.479
What I need is something
more comprehensive.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.855
Okay.

03:50.939 --> 03:51.981
Here's the deal.

03:53.233 --> 03:57.403
Truly airtight, livable ID takes... years.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.281
The Will you see before you,

04:00.365 --> 04:03.743
I micro-tweezed
like a bonsai for a decade.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.328
I'm employable.

04:05.411 --> 04:08.248
Background check me,
good luck not dozing off.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.041
Actual face online?

04:10.124 --> 04:12.043
No, can't find it.

04:12.126 --> 04:14.963
But google me and I feel real.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.342
And that, my friend, is a labor of love

04:19.425 --> 04:21.386
far too intensive to even put a price on.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.388
Okay, I get it.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.598
I appreciate you can even help me at all.

04:26.307 --> 04:29.435
Uh, so do you have it with you or...?

04:29.519 --> 04:30.353
Follow me.

04:32.188 --> 04:35.316
<i> I realized</i>
<i>that with my Candace issues,</i>

04:35.400 --> 04:37.735
<i>buying what this guy had to offer</i>
<i>wasn't enough,</i>

04:37.819 --> 04:40.738
<i>and I didn't have ten years</i>
<i>to methodically sculpt a new identity.</i>

04:40.822 --> 04:43.616
You got the benefit
of being a white dude.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.369
No one <i>ever</i> suspects shit
when it's a white dude.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.001
<i> I realized I needed to </i>be<i> him.</i>

05:03.094 --> 05:06.764
<i> Will seems okay</i>
<i>for a guy who's been in a box for a week.</i>

05:07.724 --> 05:09.475
<i>Without Mr. Mooney's help</i>

05:09.559 --> 05:12.061
<i>it took two full days</i>
<i>to put this thing together.</i>

05:12.145 --> 05:14.772
<i>Stressful doing it</i>
<i>with Will watching me, tied up.</i>

05:14.856 --> 05:16.232
You should be so proud of yourself.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.900
<i>Three quarter-inch plexi's a beast.</i>

05:17.984 --> 05:20.653
<i>Yet those edges are a thing of beauty.</i>

05:20.737 --> 05:21.946
...attention to detail...

05:22.030 --> 05:24.115
<i>I gotta think Mooney would be impressed.</i>

05:24.198 --> 05:26.326
I'm guessing it represents
more to you too.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.162
Safe space, perhaps?

05:29.620 --> 05:32.123
One you felt you needed
as a child for protection--

05:32.206 --> 05:34.876
I know everyone in this town
likes to talk about their feelings,

05:35.752 --> 05:37.337
so if you want a therapy session...

05:39.255 --> 05:40.214
tell me about Jasper.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.008
Look at you now.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.345
Able to put yourself on the outside,

05:45.428 --> 05:46.763
that must be so empowering--

05:46.846 --> 05:48.556
Who... is Jasper?

05:49.891 --> 05:50.850
Come on.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.769
He said you have something of his.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.771
He's looking for me.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.982
-Cannot keep me in here, Joe.
-I told you, this is temporary.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.275
Then what is the plan?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.861
I'm-- Look, I didn't--
I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.404
I didn't-- I didn't think.

06:03.654 --> 06:04.781
I acted.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.032
It was an emergency.

06:06.115 --> 06:08.242
- You can let me out.
-That's great, I would love to.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.703
Let's just figure out a way
to do that safely for us both.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.374
As soon as Jasper goes away.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.958
See, you're not hearing me.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.628
This cage isn't great.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.381
I need light.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.216
I need my meds.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.219
This isn't gonna be good for you.

06:26.344 --> 06:29.597
If you want me to consider your needs...
just tell me what this guy wants.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.143
Jasper Krenn.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.063
Met him on what a layperson might term
"the dark web," all right?

06:37.146 --> 06:39.107
Not even a client.
I looked into the guy...

06:39.399 --> 06:41.067
didn't like, turned down the gig.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.610
So you've never even met?

06:42.860 --> 06:44.404
No.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.072
He doesn't know what I look like,

06:46.155 --> 06:48.783
so he won't know that you're just
some random asshole

06:48.866 --> 06:50.952
who hit me in the head with a brick
and stole my life,

06:51.035 --> 06:52.453
if that's what you're asking.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.996
Okay, okay.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.958
Okay, hold-- hold on, hold on. You...

06:58.668 --> 06:59.877
You charge a fee...

07:00.503 --> 07:01.504
in advance of meeting.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.467
You didn't give him his money back.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.430
That is probably correct.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.806
You have to pay him back.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.934
I'd love to help, but I spent it.

07:15.309 --> 07:18.354
And my earning potential
is somewhat curtailed by being in a cage.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.231
How much do you owe?

07:24.402 --> 07:27.488
<i> Three thousand dollars.</i>

07:27.572 --> 07:28.698
<i>It's no problem.</i>

07:28.781 --> 07:30.366
<i>It's just 2,700 more than I had</i>

07:30.450 --> 07:33.035
<i>due to the lack of planning</i>
<i>that preceded my departure.</i>

07:34.745 --> 07:36.164
<i>Teach a man to fish...</i>

07:36.664 --> 07:38.666
<i>you feed him for a lifetime.</i>

07:39.625 --> 07:42.628
<i>Teach him how to make a counterfeit book,</i>

07:42.712 --> 07:45.047
<i>and maybe, just maybe...</i>

07:45.673 --> 07:48.176
<i>he can cobble together</i>
<i>a little something worth...</i>

07:48.259 --> 07:49.260
Three grand.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.679
Best I can do.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.725
Three grand it is.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.894
<i> I'll admit, bar was low.</i>

07:57.977 --> 08:01.439
<i>Mooney would have thrown the thing</i>
<i>back at me, had me do it 50 more times.</i>

08:02.064 --> 08:06.110
<i>Fortunately, an LA bookseller</i>
<i>is practically an oxymoron.</i>

08:09.155 --> 08:13.784
<i>At least now I'd be able</i>
<i>to send this Jasper fella on his way,</i>

08:13.868 --> 08:15.161
<i>get back to our story:</i>

08:15.536 --> 08:16.662
<i>you...</i>

08:16.913 --> 08:18.873
<i>the person who may</i>

08:18.956 --> 08:22.084
<i>just make paying a $3,000 toll</i>

08:22.168 --> 08:23.920
<i>to stay in this urban Gomorrah</i>

08:24.003 --> 08:24.921
<i>worth it.</i>

08:25.588 --> 08:27.256
<i>If only you weren't such an early riser.</i>

08:28.716 --> 08:29.759
<i>It's becoming clear,</i>

08:30.176 --> 08:31.719
<i>the more I see of you,</i>

08:31.802 --> 08:35.223
<i>the harder it is to see you clearly.</i>

08:36.140 --> 08:37.558
<i>If I don't want to get hurt,</i>

08:37.642 --> 08:40.520
<i>I have to keep a distance</i>
<i>till I've done my due diligence.</i>

08:40.603 --> 08:41.479
Hey!

08:43.940 --> 08:45.816
You keep wandering off. Here.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.945
<i>Though that's hard</i>
<i>when you keep inviting me to things.</i>

08:49.028 --> 08:50.655
I just didn't want to get in your way.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.240
Oh, that's impossible.

08:53.824 --> 08:54.825
Wow!

08:54.951 --> 08:56.827
Look at that opah.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.871
-Is that Ecuadorian or local? Thank you.
- Local.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.166
I know you're making
all of this up to impress me.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.417
You don't have to try so hard.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.462
If you told me that fish was an alien,
I would believe you.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.007
No, that's why it's good
you took me up on this.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.300
For a guy who works at Anavrin,

09:11.384 --> 09:14.720
you sorely lack an understanding
of the pescatarian lifestyle.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.764
I'm a pescatarian ignoramus.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.270
Are you okay? You look a little...

09:22.812 --> 09:23.854
Mmm.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.364
-<i> No.</i>

09:33.447 --> 09:35.992
<i>Too soon, too much, too good.</i>

09:36.075 --> 09:38.619
Yeah, I just wanted to stop
thinking about it and just do it.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.371
Interested?

10:24.206 --> 10:25.416
Hate the idea?

10:25.499 --> 10:26.959
I'm sorry, what did you say?

10:28.127 --> 10:29.045
Lunch today.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.421
My friends.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.424
I think we should
just rip the Band-Aid off.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.594
They're very LA, but they're also great,

10:36.677 --> 10:38.763
and... they're important to me.

10:39.513 --> 10:40.431
So...

10:40.890 --> 10:43.017
<i> And now you want me to meet</i>
<i>your friends?</i>

10:43.100 --> 10:46.646
<i>I really, really need</i>
<i>a clinical distance. No.</i>

10:46.729 --> 10:47.563
I'd love to.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.522
<i> Shit.</i>

10:56.280 --> 10:57.907
Earth to Spock.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.075
Come in, Spock.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.661
Where'd you go, old sport?

11:02.161 --> 11:04.497
You had that look
like when Keanu sees the black cat.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.291
"Oh. Glitch in the Matrix."

11:07.375 --> 11:10.086
<i> We kissed and I saw the ghost</i>
<i>of Guinevere Beck,</i>

11:10.169 --> 11:11.879
<i>my Matrix </i>is<i> glitching.</i>

11:11.962 --> 11:13.089
Yeah.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.507
Yeah, uh, no.

11:14.590 --> 11:15.633
I'm-- I'm fine, thanks.

11:15.716 --> 11:16.676
You know what?

11:16.884 --> 11:18.969
Let's see here.

11:19.053 --> 11:22.890
How about we move the women's lit display?

11:22.973 --> 11:24.642
Like, why are we separating them?

11:24.725 --> 11:26.143
That's sexist.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.061
Right?

11:27.144 --> 11:31.148
And besides, I woke up
with a completely brilliant idea.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.652
-What's the idea?
-Movies.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.697
-On loop in-- in the bookstore.
- <i>Oh, no.</i>

11:37.780 --> 11:39.448
Movies that are-- wait for it...

11:40.282 --> 11:41.200
also books.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.327
<i> Kill it with fire.</i>

11:43.411 --> 11:44.412
It's a great idea.

11:44.495 --> 11:47.081
-Dope movies like <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>
-<i> Not based on a book.</i>

11:47.164 --> 11:48.999
-Whichever of the <i>Star Wars...</i>
-<i> Again--</i>

11:49.083 --> 11:50.876
<i>Fifty Shades,</i> obviously.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.546
<i> One for three, marginally.</i>

11:53.629 --> 11:57.049
We are gonna sell so many books,
it is going to blow your fucking mind.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.177
-Can't wait.
-So just come clean this up,

12:00.261 --> 12:01.470
set up the screen,

12:01.554 --> 12:04.223
and when it all looks so cute
you wanna fuck it,

12:04.849 --> 12:05.808
holla at your boy.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.351
Namaste.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.606
I'm sorry,

12:13.107 --> 12:14.650
did you think this was a real bookstore?

12:15.151 --> 12:16.444
Bless your heart.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.154
It's cute.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.081
Hey, Bettelheim?

12:30.666 --> 12:31.500
<i> Jasper.</i>

12:33.335 --> 12:35.713
He said that you had something
that you wanted to give back.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.423
<i> This is Jasper?</i>

12:37.506 --> 12:39.800
<i>He looks like a manager</i>
<i>at a comic book store.</i>

12:39.884 --> 12:41.093
Sorry, who you looking for?

12:41.552 --> 12:44.346
Well, you, Mr., uh, Will B.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.640
Girl at your apartment
said you worked here.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.476
Did she mention that I left word for you?

12:48.684 --> 12:51.145
I'm-- I'm sorry.  I'm Jasper.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.439
Oh, right. Man, I have been
having trouble reaching you.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.317
I'm sorry, my phone's been weird,
you know?

12:56.400 --> 12:57.777
But here, your money.

12:57.860 --> 12:58.778
Here.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.450
-It should all be there.
-All 50 grand?

13:05.451 --> 13:06.744
<i> I'm sorry, 50?!</i>

13:06.827 --> 13:08.704
That's some of it,
I got to liquidate the rest.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.706
Oh. Oh, it's okay.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.250
But I'll need it today.
Is that still all right?

13:14.084 --> 13:15.002
That's great.

13:15.878 --> 13:16.796
Perfect.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.715
Hey, one other thing, uh...

13:19.799 --> 13:20.758
-Sure.
-Check this out.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.092
-Wanna show you something.
-What?

13:23.302 --> 13:24.261
What are you doing?

13:27.556 --> 13:29.642
It's okay, it's okay. Squeeze hard.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.268
Right at the knuckle, a little higher.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.270
Good. Good, good, good, good good.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.396
Now...

13:34.939 --> 13:36.232
I'm gonna need you to...

13:36.315 --> 13:38.859
just gotta hold that for me.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.611
Great, and, uh...

13:41.111 --> 13:42.488
drop her in there.

13:42.571 --> 13:43.614
There you go.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.243
Now, over at St. Henry's
they have a fantastic microsurgeon,

13:47.326 --> 13:48.327
Dr. Daniel.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.371
As long as you're there
in the next 10, 12 hours,

13:50.454 --> 13:51.831
good chance it'll reattach.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.624
Provided you have this. So...

13:54.375 --> 13:56.335
give me a call
when you have the rest of the money.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.587
Probably sooner
better than later, I'd think.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.631
Good to finally meet you, Will.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.597
<i> This is bad.</i>

14:08.681 --> 14:10.891
<i>Easily leave-town bad.</i>

14:10.975 --> 14:14.645
<i>But this is your town, Love,</i>
<i>and I can't leave you.</i>

14:18.524 --> 14:21.193
It's 50 thousand, Will! It's not three!

14:22.069 --> 14:24.864
Can we please talk about
the <i>$47,000</i> discrepancy?

14:24.947 --> 14:26.824
Can we talk about my hand?

14:27.449 --> 14:28.492
<i> Oh, no.</i>

14:29.201 --> 14:30.828
I told you everything.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.414
I told you everything,
and now it's too late.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.834
<i> I admit, I thought</i>
<i>his whole "needing meds" thing</i>

14:36.917 --> 14:37.751
<i>was a ploy.</i>

14:37.835 --> 14:39.044
Fuck Jasper.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.798
He's just some asshole
Russian mafia-adjacent wanker.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.758
Were you even followed?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.760
How would you even know,
you amateur!

14:47.386 --> 14:49.054
They've found me and it's over

14:49.138 --> 14:51.056
and you exposed us and now they're...

14:55.227 --> 14:57.229
Oh... okay.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.486
Oh... Will?

15:06.614 --> 15:07.573
Hey, buddy.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.701
Do you have any money anywhere?
Think, Will, think.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.580
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Will, listen to me,
no one knows you're here.

15:14.663 --> 15:18.250
No one can take care of you
if the guy you stole from murders me.

15:18.918 --> 15:19.919
Am I making sense?

15:25.090 --> 15:25.925
Rufus...

15:26.842 --> 15:28.844
he owes me 50 large.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.429
He's good, he just...

15:30.512 --> 15:31.931
Text him the code word.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.807
This is important.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.434
When I was eight, I broke my arm,

15:35.517 --> 15:38.062
and they put a pin in it
and it's been transmitting,

15:38.145 --> 15:40.105
so don't you go to the hospital.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.025
They will chip you like a dog,
you understand me?

15:43.567 --> 15:45.945
Thank you so much for caring, Will.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.698
I can and I will neutralize
that chip for you.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.616
Okay.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.494
What was that code word?

15:55.537 --> 15:59.708
<i> Apparently, Rufus is someone</i>
<i>who conveniently owes Will</i>

15:59.792 --> 16:01.043
<i>50 large.</i>

16:03.170 --> 16:05.172
<i>While this feels too easy,</i>

16:05.255 --> 16:08.092
<i>right about now the universe</i>
<i>owes me a little easy.</i>

16:11.679 --> 16:12.805
<i>Spoke too soon.</i>

16:13.681 --> 16:16.100
<i>That's not gonna work.</i>
<i>I have a lunch with you.</i>

16:22.940 --> 16:23.983
12-2.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.193
<i> And I hate Rufus.</i>

16:27.361 --> 16:28.320
<i>Damn it.</i>

16:28.946 --> 16:30.948
<i>I have to cancel our lunch, Love.</i>

16:36.370 --> 16:38.497
<i>For the record, I'm opening sobbing.</i>

16:43.836 --> 16:46.296
-Hey.
<i>-Just calling to hear if you were crying.</i>

16:46.630 --> 16:48.674
-You sound fine.
<i>-Crying on the inside.</i>

16:48.757 --> 16:49.591
I'm sorry.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.678
<i> You're direct. You do what you feel.</i>
<i>You just pick up the phone.</i>

16:52.761 --> 16:54.221
<i>I'm just sorry I'm not gonna see you.</i>

16:54.304 --> 16:55.931
<i> This is how you handle rejection.</i>

16:56.015 --> 16:58.809
<i>You want me to not feel bad</i>
<i>about blowing you off.</i>

16:58.892 --> 17:00.477
What can I say? Forty's a dick.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.979
He sent me on a run to Alhambra

17:02.062 --> 17:05.065
to get a sample of the competition's
compostable picnicware.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.692
Forty said that?

17:09.653 --> 17:11.405
Well, my coven's gonna be, uh...

17:12.322 --> 17:14.074
sad they don't get to meet you today.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.118
<i>Yikes. Please don't let them hex me.</i>

17:16.201 --> 17:17.953
<i>I'm sorry, I wanted to be there.</i>

17:18.370 --> 17:19.621
Yeah, I know, me too.

17:19.705 --> 17:20.789
Talk later, 'kay?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.378
<i> Wanted to be there so much I decided</i>
<i>I had to at least drop by, you know?</i>

17:27.379 --> 17:30.674
<i>I don't have the time to join you,</i>
<i>but I can spare a few minutes.</i>

17:32.051 --> 17:35.804
<i>Especially when I've learned</i>
<i>how friends say so much about a person.</i>

17:35.888 --> 17:37.222
Will can't make it.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.099
-He's sorry he can't be here.
-No.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.393
<i> Like how influenced you are</i>
<i>by their opinion,</i>

17:41.477 --> 17:44.521
<i>-how much they secretly run your life.</i>
- I'm bummed.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.774
I was so ready
to meet your new man-friend.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.942
And by "meet,"
Gabe means "judge and deem unworthy."

17:49.068 --> 17:50.903
I'm sorry,
who are you talking about?

17:52.654 --> 17:53.822
<i> Lucy Sprecher.</i>

17:54.073 --> 17:57.034
<i>She met Love at a rally for LGBTQ rights.</i>

17:57.117 --> 17:59.286
<i>Back then, Lucy was an unpaid intern.</i>

17:59.369 --> 18:02.664
<i>Now she's a social savvy power agent</i>
<i>whose clients include all the Jennifers,</i>

18:02.748 --> 18:05.459
<i>the Kates, and the EU's</i>
<i>top-selling Instagram poet.</i>

18:06.168 --> 18:08.754
- Okay, okay, okay!
- She is coming for me!

18:10.714 --> 18:12.800
Just ignore Lucy, she hates everyone.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.636
Please ignore Sunrise.
She overcompensates for my bitch face.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.471
Yeah, I do, babe. You're welcome.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.099
- I love it.
- Okay.<i> </i>Okay, have you...

18:20.182 --> 18:21.058
<i> Here we go.</i>

18:21.683 --> 18:25.646
<i>Sunrise Darshan Cummings, Lucy's partner.</i>

18:25.729 --> 18:28.107
<i>Ironically never met of sunset</i>
<i>she didn't like.</i>

18:28.607 --> 18:29.858
<i>Stay-at-home mommy blogger,</i>

18:29.942 --> 18:33.612
<i>and Earth guide</i>
<i>to their adorable toddler, Candle.</i>

18:33.904 --> 18:36.198
<i>Sunrise cannot be this happy</i>

18:36.281 --> 18:38.450
<i>unless blending functional mushrooms</i>
<i>in your almond latte</i>

18:38.534 --> 18:40.077
<i>is the grail we have all been seeking.</i>

18:40.160 --> 18:43.872
They source it from this incredible
biodynamic flaxseed guy.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.208
<i> Whatever that meant.</i>

18:46.834 --> 18:48.418
<i>Gabe Miranda.</i>

18:48.794 --> 18:50.087
<i>Small business owner,</i>

18:50.170 --> 18:53.173
<i>which in his case</i>
<i>means a pansexual acupuncturist.</i>

18:53.257 --> 18:55.551
<i>"Student," air quotes, of psychedelics.</i>

18:56.218 --> 19:00.013
<i>Mostly dates men, but does something</i>
<i>I'm not gonna try to pronounce,</i>

19:00.097 --> 19:01.598
<i>that's essentially...</i>

19:01.682 --> 19:04.101
<i>fingering women to orgasm</i>
<i>on a pile of yoga pillows</i>

19:04.184 --> 19:05.894
<i>packaged as a spiritual practice.</i>

19:06.562 --> 19:07.980
<i>And you and Gabe</i>

19:08.564 --> 19:09.648
<i>go back the farthest.</i>

19:09.731 --> 19:10.566
<i>Besties.</i>

19:11.066 --> 19:13.610
<i>So, this Is the Love squad.</i>

19:14.069 --> 19:15.946
<i>Teeth-achingly, hippy-dippy,</i>

19:16.029 --> 19:17.781
<i>unaware of the glaring privilege,</i>

19:17.865 --> 19:19.908
<i>driving their so-called conscious choices.</i>

19:20.617 --> 19:22.327
<i>Do they secretly want to sleep with you?</i>

19:22.786 --> 19:23.954
<i>Own you?</i>

19:24.037 --> 19:25.080
<i>Steal you away?</i>

19:25.414 --> 19:26.498
<i>To Paris?</i>

19:26.582 --> 19:28.458
- Oh, my God.
- Will and I kissed.

19:28.542 --> 19:29.751
-You kissed?
- Yeah.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.752
I love that.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.421
I wish Will did,

19:32.504 --> 19:35.215
'cause I'm pretty sure I scared him
and now he's avoiding me.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.509
<i> And this is it,</i>
<i>this is when I get annihilated.</i>

19:37.593 --> 19:40.012
Well, then maybe he's an idiot
who should go fuck himself.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.181
Okay, or maybe he's shy.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.266
Love can be a little forthright.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.184
Compliment.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.936
So maybe the idea of meeting
three more of us is genuinely scary.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.646
You're soft.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.940
-Am I too forthright?
-No.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.068
-Real men love that shit.
-Right.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.487
Let's focus on what
is actually important here.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.157
Which is...?

20:01.825 --> 20:04.036
That your heart maybe wants back
in the game.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.081
Maybe it's time.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.127
I just, um... like him.

20:12.711 --> 20:13.629
Aww!

20:15.464 --> 20:16.965
I know I don't talk about...

20:17.758 --> 20:18.884
James much.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.095
I just really thought, you know...

20:22.596 --> 20:24.056
I met my soulmate,

20:24.139 --> 20:26.391
and that's done, and...

20:27.184 --> 20:30.020
so the rest of my life will be,
like, you know...

20:30.103 --> 20:31.813
Oh, honey, I know.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.316
No, no, I'm...

20:34.775 --> 20:35.609
It's fine.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.986
But no one excites me,

20:38.070 --> 20:39.988
you know, no one makes me miss them...

20:40.364 --> 20:41.448
like James.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.952
But now I'll just be doing something...

20:45.535 --> 20:48.080
-random and I'll miss Will.
- Aw!

20:48.163 --> 20:50.123
-I don't even know him.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.378
-Am I being crazy?
- Oh, no.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.380
No, I think that maybe...

20:57.214 --> 20:58.840
maybe you're falling for him a tiny bit.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.885
-That's so terrifying.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.554
Aw. That's why
we're here for you, beautiful.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.182
Waitress,
bring us all the desserts!

21:07.266 --> 21:09.142
-I want 'em all!
- No!

21:09.226 --> 21:10.060
Sorry.

21:11.478 --> 21:12.729
<i> I take it all back.</i>

21:12.813 --> 21:14.648
<i>I love your friends.</i>

21:14.940 --> 21:16.483
<i>And I see you, Love,</i>

21:16.566 --> 21:19.444
<i>I hear you, and...</i>
<i> I get it now.</i>

21:34.334 --> 21:36.128
<i> Am I losing my mind?</i>

21:44.928 --> 21:46.680
<i> Hell, I've arrived.</i>

21:47.347 --> 21:49.349
<i>It's called the San Fernando Valley.</i>

21:50.142 --> 21:52.602
<i>At the borders of which</i>
<i>anyone with an architect's degree</i>

21:52.686 --> 21:54.062
<i>is apparently denied entry.</i>

21:55.230 --> 21:56.315
<i>A party...</i>

21:57.107 --> 21:58.191
<i>at noon...</i>

21:58.442 --> 22:00.193
<i>on a Tuesday.</i>

22:10.746 --> 22:12.748
<i> Well, I'm glad these people</i>
<i>found each other.</i>

22:12.831 --> 22:14.833
<i>Look forward to never seeing them again.</i>

22:21.590 --> 22:25.469
<i> It'd be great if I had</i>
<i>the faintest fucking clue</i>

22:25.552 --> 22:27.929
<i>what this Rufus guy looks like.</i>

22:29.139 --> 22:29.973
Hey.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.516
I'm sorry to bother you.

22:32.976 --> 22:35.270
Would you happen to know
if there's a Rufus here?

22:35.896 --> 22:37.022
Are you John Mayer?

22:38.732 --> 22:39.566
No.

22:39.649 --> 22:40.984
No, I'm Will. I'm looking--

22:41.068 --> 22:42.069
There you are, bitch.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.653
He's not John Mayer.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.115
You're a manwhore, John Mayer.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.916
<i> I'm guessing they won't be any help.</i>

22:55.999 --> 22:57.709
Oh, my God, look over there.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.712
Oh, my God. It's totally him.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.298
<i> Hold on.</i>

23:03.840 --> 23:06.009
<i>-That's airport guy.</i>

23:06.551 --> 23:07.803
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

23:08.428 --> 23:11.431
<i>What is it about this guy that makes</i>
<i>people act like they're in a customs line</i>

23:11.515 --> 23:12.641
<i>with an ass full of heroin?</i>

23:12.724 --> 23:13.934
No, it's Hendy.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.395
You gotta get a picture of him
with me in it.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.021
<i> Hendy?</i>

23:18.522 --> 23:19.523
<i>Hendy.</i>

23:20.023 --> 23:21.066
<i>Okay, Hendy.</i>

23:22.359 --> 23:23.193
<i>Comedian.</i>

23:24.152 --> 23:27.531
<i>AKA Henderson. FKA Josh Bunter.</i>

23:29.658 --> 23:31.493
<i>Kicked cancer. Interesting.</i>

23:32.160 --> 23:34.704
<i>Is ostentatiously zen about it.</i>
<i>Predictable.</i>

23:36.957 --> 23:38.542
<i>Wait a second, this is Vacuum Guy?</i>

23:38.959 --> 23:40.168
<i>Ethan loved this gag.</i>

23:41.586 --> 23:42.754
<i>Oh!</i>

23:44.798 --> 23:45.882
<i>Brexit!</i>

23:47.050 --> 23:48.051
<i>Right?</i>

23:48.260 --> 23:49.177
<i> Apparently,</i>

23:49.344 --> 23:53.432
<i>Hendy's got a hard-life-lessons</i>
<i>man-of-the-people thing working for him.</i>

23:59.688 --> 24:00.605
Apartment three?

24:00.689 --> 24:02.023
<i> Oh, great.</i>

24:02.482 --> 24:05.026
Is this party gonna get any more weird?

24:05.193 --> 24:07.237
-What happened to your hand?
-Uh... Oh, it's...

24:07.737 --> 24:10.407
Oh, you're really not from here.
I asked, but I actually don't care.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.452
I've been up for two days
chasing that whole Jared Padalecki thing,

24:13.535 --> 24:16.121
but he's been laying low,
so I kind of detoured here

24:16.204 --> 24:18.582
to find this hairstylist, Kido.

24:18.665 --> 24:19.916
Word has it he can confirm...

24:20.000 --> 24:23.462
<i> Really couldn't care less about Kido</i>
<i>or why Delilah's here at all.</i>

24:23.545 --> 24:26.756
<i>If anything, I've only got more reason</i>
<i>to get the hell out of here.</i>

24:26.840 --> 24:29.092
...Rufus who knows the owner of this house
who's a producer

24:29.176 --> 24:31.803
-and he knows Kido--
-Wait, I'm sorry, did you say Rufus?

24:32.429 --> 24:33.847
Yeah, my girl Tanika knows him.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.891
The friend I'm looking for
has a buddy, Rufus.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.685
Could you--
could you maybe point him out for me?

24:39.769 --> 24:40.770
You're kidding me.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.024
Delilah.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.277
Hey, long time.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.278
You look great.

24:48.361 --> 24:50.989
I look like a walking red-eye
from Pittsburgh, but you look great.

24:51.072 --> 24:53.074
-What are you doing here?
-Just working on a piece.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.702
'Course you are.
Always the smartest girl in the room.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.871
Yep. It's exhausting.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.039
Yeah.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.458
What, d'you go for
the president's curly fries?

25:01.791 --> 25:02.959
Sorry, this is Will.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.420
Hi. No, it was an accident at work.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.757
It might need surgery, but it's, uh,
you know, it's okay.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.592
Well, if you do, Dr. Daniel

25:10.675 --> 25:12.302
at St. Henry's Medical Center.

25:12.385 --> 25:15.138
Uh, if you go, tell him we're friends
and he'll hook you up.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.058
Thank you. Thanks.
Really, I appreciate that.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.226
-Yeah.
- Hendy!

25:19.684 --> 25:22.812
Uh... excuse me, guys.
Great to see you, gorgeous.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.360
Well!

25:28.944 --> 25:30.028
He seems pretty great.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.864
Drool a little more,
it's a good look on you.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.534
Did he come up in one of your pieces?

25:35.617 --> 25:38.703
Meaning is there shit on him? Scoop?

25:39.079 --> 25:41.957
-Inquiring minds want to know?
<i>-</i>Never mind. If you don't want--

25:42.040 --> 25:43.750
Let me just give you
the <i>Idiot's Guide,</i> okay?

25:43.833 --> 25:45.293
Being famous...

25:45.502 --> 25:46.920
don't make you magic.

25:47.462 --> 25:50.298
Cover shit in gold,
it's just super shiny shit.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.217
I had a feeling you might know that,

25:52.300 --> 25:54.844
but I was wrong, and now I pity you.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.597
-Excuse me.
-Hold on. You gonna point out Rufus?

25:57.681 --> 25:58.932
You're a big boy. Figure it out.

25:59.724 --> 26:00.809
-Hey.
-Yeah?

26:00.892 --> 26:02.727
-Rufus would like his Negroni.
-All right.

26:02.811 --> 26:03.853
Thank you.

26:12.821 --> 26:13.655
Hi.

26:14.114 --> 26:14.948
Excuse me.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.324
Rufus?

26:16.408 --> 26:17.576
Oh, you found me.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.577
Yes.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.495
Hey, lose the clothes if it's all right.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.330
Hope you like Air Supply.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.750
I'm kind of kind of
on a ballad jag right now.

26:31.881 --> 26:33.758
You look different
than your picture on the app.

26:33.842 --> 26:34.926
It's Todd, right?

26:35.010 --> 26:37.929
Actually,
I'm here for "Battlestar."

26:38.805 --> 26:40.557
-You're not Will.
-No.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.267
He told me to use the code word.

26:42.684 --> 26:43.810
I'm helping him out.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.605
Here I'm about to blow you.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.150
I got your shit in my bag.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.530
There you go.

26:58.491 --> 26:59.826
It's okay if I count it?

27:00.118 --> 27:01.202
You shittin' me?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.086
These are pills.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.379
Same ones, man.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.964
But faster acting.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.841
I got a new source in Quebec.

27:14.924 --> 27:16.551
What about the 50 grand?

27:16.968 --> 27:17.927
The 50 grand?

27:20.930 --> 27:22.641
Would you settle for that blowjob?

27:30.440 --> 27:34.194
<i> It turns out</i>
<i>Rufus has been supplying OG Will</i>

27:34.277 --> 27:36.279
<i>with off-brand Canadian meds</i>

27:36.363 --> 27:39.157
<i>for a rather severe bipolar disorder.</i>

27:39.240 --> 27:41.284
<i>Explains so much.</i>

27:42.494 --> 27:45.872
<i> Evidently,</i>
<i>Will kept just enough of a grip</i>

27:45.955 --> 27:47.624
<i>to turn me into his TaskRabbit.</i>

27:47.707 --> 27:49.209
<i>But hey, he needs them.</i>

27:49.542 --> 27:52.170
Nope, I won't take 'em. Flush 'em!

27:55.256 --> 27:56.341
Keep your poison.

27:56.883 --> 27:57.926
What do you mean?

27:58.426 --> 28:00.178
I went to the Valley for you.

28:00.970 --> 28:05.016
<i> Farewell to that small part of Will</i>
<i>aspiring to sanity, I guess.</i>

28:05.100 --> 28:05.975
You'll feel better.

28:06.059 --> 28:09.020
Yeah, then you take 'em, fucker,
'cause I don't believe you.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.022
You should believe me!

28:11.106 --> 28:13.024
Believe me when I tell you...

28:13.775 --> 28:15.235
I could hand you to Jasper.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.445
I wouldn't have your problems anymore.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.330
<i> Learned something today.</i>

28:27.747 --> 28:29.958
<i>Screaming at crazy</i>

28:30.041 --> 28:31.584
<i>can reopen a wound.</i>

28:32.377 --> 28:35.213
<i>Love, this is trial by fire for you.</i>

28:47.684 --> 28:49.352
Hey, I really think
we need to talk.

28:49.936 --> 28:50.895
Oh.

28:51.938 --> 28:52.814
Hey.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.232
Hey.

28:55.525 --> 28:56.985
Oh, my God! What happened?

28:57.068 --> 28:58.236
Oh, it's-- it's nothing.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.029
-Oh, no, what did you do?
-No, it's fine.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.615
It's a cut, it's nothing.
What do you want to talk to me about?

29:07.245 --> 29:08.413
You lied to me.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.582
-What?
-Lunch.

29:12.083 --> 29:12.917
Forty?

29:14.461 --> 29:17.213
He's a bad alibi. He's been telling me
everything since we were born.

29:17.881 --> 29:18.798
<i> Shit.</i>

29:18.882 --> 29:20.925
-Is Forty your brother?
-My twin brother.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.637
And you called him a dick,
which he can be,

29:24.929 --> 29:26.639
but you were also lying.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.308
You own Anavrin.

29:28.600 --> 29:32.645
<i> That's what I get for not trying</i>
<i>to find out everything about you first.</i>

29:32.729 --> 29:34.647
My parents own Anavrin.

29:35.106 --> 29:36.483
I just work there.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.903
I was trying not to instantly
complicate things

29:39.986 --> 29:41.237
by waiting to tell you.

29:41.404 --> 29:43.990
But you...
you complicated things by lying.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.159
Why would you lie?

29:46.242 --> 29:49.496
<i> So I could walk through</i>
<i>fire for you.</i>

29:49.579 --> 29:53.041
<i>So I could slay dragons to stay near you.</i>

29:53.124 --> 29:55.960
-I just-- I don't know you.
-Yet.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.213
-You don't know me.
-Yeah, well, apparently.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.714
Because I thought that we were...

30:02.592 --> 30:04.010
I mean, we kissed, Will.

30:04.093 --> 30:05.929
This is... This is not a good time.

30:06.012 --> 30:07.430
This is not good timing.

30:09.682 --> 30:10.975
This is about your ex, isn't it?

30:11.059 --> 30:11.893
-<i> Yes.</i>
-No.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.980
She <i>really</i> hurt you.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.607
<i> I can smell your shampoo,</i>

30:17.690 --> 30:20.610
<i>and nothing you're doing is making it</i>
<i>easier for me to see you clearly.</i>

30:20.693 --> 30:23.071
But guess what? My husband hurt me, too.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.490
Among other things, by dying.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.910
So, I understand why this is hard for you,

30:28.993 --> 30:31.663
but it's also why I just say things now.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.875
'Cause there was things
I was waiting to say to him.

30:37.585 --> 30:40.255
And I-- I don't know
if this is just a fling

30:40.338 --> 30:42.632
or something more, but either way...

30:43.341 --> 30:45.885
I think it's a mistake to do
the bullshit thing that you're doing.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.512
-No, it's not bullshit--
-Yes, it is!

30:47.595 --> 30:49.138
You don't need to run away.

30:49.639 --> 30:50.765
Please, no.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.600
-Stop.
-You can--

30:52.684 --> 30:54.060
Please! Stop!

30:55.520 --> 30:56.646
Just stop!

31:03.778 --> 31:04.654
Okay.

31:05.738 --> 31:06.906
You don't need to yell.

31:07.866 --> 31:08.908
Ever.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.122
I liked you.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.211
This sucks.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.383
You're bleeding again.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.016
Why are you here?

31:33.099 --> 31:35.852
You've actually lost
a lot of blood today, Joe.

31:35.935 --> 31:36.853
Is that what you are?

31:38.271 --> 31:39.188
My lost blood?

31:39.522 --> 31:41.065
Really all-in on this one.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.067
I guess that's you, right?

31:43.735 --> 31:45.320
See a girl once.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.905
I'm-- I'm trying...

31:47.488 --> 31:49.115
to do it right this time.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.325
As opposed to with me.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.621
What went wrong with me, Joe?

31:55.997 --> 31:57.540
We both know what happened.

31:57.624 --> 31:58.958
You can haunt me forever,

31:59.042 --> 32:02.837
you will never get me to say
I didn't do everything I could for you...

32:03.379 --> 32:05.256
-for us.
-Look at me, Joe.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.716
-No, you are not--
-Look at me.

32:06.799 --> 32:09.344
You are not here.
I am not arguing with you!

32:27.362 --> 32:28.613
Hey, Jasper, yeah.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.532
Yes, it's Will.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.076
I am on my way.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.913
Thank you for coming. Is that my...?

32:36.996 --> 32:38.998
Perfectly preserved
and anxious to get back to Daddy.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.291
Great. It's right in here.

32:43.002 --> 32:43.878
Look...

32:46.923 --> 32:48.549
I am not Will Bettelheim.

32:51.469 --> 32:52.679
-This is.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.141
Well, this is a first for me.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.688
My name is Joe Goldberg.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.023
I just needed his name

33:04.107 --> 33:06.234
and his life for a little while.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.778
So you put him in
a Hannibal Lecter thing, I see that.

33:09.195 --> 33:11.572
I assume you realize
that you need psychiatric help?

33:11.656 --> 33:12.699
I'm not crazy, okay?

33:12.782 --> 33:15.743
My ex-girlfriend's stalking me
and this is the best I could come up with.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.954
But can I please have my finger?
'Cause this is Will.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.081
He took your money. Take him.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.041
Well, if you couldn't get it out of him...

33:22.583 --> 33:23.418
Right?

33:24.168 --> 33:25.086
I mean...

33:27.755 --> 33:28.715
You sure, now?

33:31.384 --> 33:33.011
-You ain't got it?
-Please don't.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.638
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to--

34:10.882 --> 34:12.008
You see, Joe?

34:15.887 --> 34:16.763
No.

34:16.888 --> 34:17.972
You don't understand.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.015
But I do.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.227
I'm trying to survive.
He wanted to hurt me.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.146
Well, you hurt him.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.608
And you hurt me.

34:32.820 --> 34:33.738
I loved you.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.657
-More than I've ever--
-Then you hurt me.

34:49.378 --> 34:50.797
Look at me, Joe.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.679
Sometimes...

35:00.098 --> 35:01.682
we hurt the one we love.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.017
Right?

35:05.686 --> 35:07.772
You're not afraid Love will hurt you.

35:10.983 --> 35:13.444
You're afraid you'll hurt her.

35:17.490 --> 35:18.407
I'm sorry.

35:22.537 --> 35:23.788
I'm so sorry.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.752
No. Please stay.

35:30.545 --> 35:31.546
Please.

35:32.421 --> 35:33.381
Stay.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.554
I'm sorry.

35:40.304 --> 35:41.514
I'm so sorry.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.613
<i> Hendy was right.</i>

35:58.364 --> 36:00.867
<i>Dr. Daniel, one impressive microsurgeon.</i>

36:00.950 --> 36:02.535
<i>Thank goodness for these pain pills.</i>

36:02.618 --> 36:05.329
<i>They're gonna block out</i>
<i>more than one type of pain tonight.</i>

36:06.414 --> 36:09.250
<i>Knocking out Anavrin's security cameras</i>
<i>will cover up another.</i>

36:16.048 --> 36:19.927
<i> Sometimes I wonder</i>
<i>if I understand love at all.</i>

36:20.887 --> 36:22.597
<i>The thing transforms us.</i>

36:22.680 --> 36:24.265
<i>But into what?</i>

36:24.807 --> 36:29.103
<i>Love turned me into something else</i>
<i>back then with Beck.</i>

36:35.151 --> 36:36.319
<i>My hope now...</i>

36:37.570 --> 36:40.031
<i>is that you can turn me</i>
<i>into something better.</i>

36:42.033 --> 36:43.451
<i>Because of this is all I am,</i>

36:43.534 --> 36:46.537
<i>I may as well turn myself into Candace.</i>

36:53.669 --> 36:57.423

38:37.356 --> 38:38.232
Hey.

38:38.941 --> 38:41.068
Wow, it smells amazing in here.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.866
I did not just make you an entire meal.

38:46.949 --> 38:48.451
I am angry and embarrassed

38:48.534 --> 38:50.494
and I shouldn't have texted you back.

38:50.578 --> 38:51.620
I just...

38:52.455 --> 38:54.915
I was just also hungry, so I-- you know...

38:56.208 --> 38:57.585
I'm glad you kissed me.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.213
It did not seem like it.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.173
I was.

39:02.715 --> 39:03.674
I was also freaked out,

39:03.758 --> 39:06.260
not because you did it,
but because of how it felt.

39:06.552 --> 39:07.720
I didn't expect...

39:08.929 --> 39:10.056
-you.

39:10.556 --> 39:11.390
This.

39:11.932 --> 39:12.892
I wasn't looking...

39:13.851 --> 39:14.852
for this.

39:15.102 --> 39:16.562
I want it, but I can't...

39:17.730 --> 39:18.814
have it...

39:19.565 --> 39:21.067
right now with you...

39:22.193 --> 39:23.402
or-- or anyone.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.073
She really hurt you, huh?

39:27.823 --> 39:28.699
Mm.

39:29.909 --> 39:30.785
No.

39:32.119 --> 39:33.996
No, I hurt her.

39:35.456 --> 39:36.624
I really hurt her.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.752
So you understand, I can't--

39:39.835 --> 39:41.045
Did you wanna hurt her?

39:42.713 --> 39:43.547
No.

39:44.965 --> 39:45.966
Of course not.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.553
So what I'm hearing is that two adults...

39:50.054 --> 39:51.680
both knowing the risks...

39:51.764 --> 39:53.015
I don't think she knew.

39:53.224 --> 39:56.310
Okay, well, you know,
none of us know anything.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.187
You know?
But you put on your big girl pants

39:58.270 --> 40:00.147
and we give things a shot.

40:00.356 --> 40:03.609
I have to believe that hurting her was
the last thing you wanted to do, right?

40:05.653 --> 40:07.238
-That was a question.
-Yeah, that's right.

40:07.321 --> 40:08.322
-Okay.
-Right.

40:08.489 --> 40:10.783
How about I take care of me...

40:11.409 --> 40:12.952
you take care of you...

40:14.453 --> 40:17.081
I try not to hurt you,
you try not to hurt me.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.624
You know, what else is there?

40:20.960 --> 40:21.919
I'm just...

40:23.838 --> 40:25.589
I'm-- I'm afraid.

40:31.470 --> 40:32.346
Yeah.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.682
Relationships are scary.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.311
You don't get all that goodness
and possibility with zero risk.

40:39.728 --> 40:41.063
But, Will...

40:43.441 --> 40:45.234
you cannot hurt me.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.320
<i> I want to believe that.</i>

40:51.449 --> 40:52.408
Okay.

40:54.702 --> 40:55.661
Thank you.

40:57.746 --> 40:59.290
I just...

41:00.332 --> 41:02.042
-Just come here.
-Okay.

41:02.501 --> 41:03.669
Look, to be honest,

41:03.752 --> 41:04.920
I feel...

41:06.297 --> 41:07.423
so shitty...

41:08.799 --> 41:10.259
about the way it went with her.

41:11.093 --> 41:11.927
So I can't...

41:12.553 --> 41:13.471
I can't...

41:14.013 --> 41:14.930
till she's...

41:15.389 --> 41:16.557
really gone.

41:18.559 --> 41:19.852
No, it's valid.

41:21.020 --> 41:22.062
Yeah, no, I...

41:22.563 --> 41:23.772
Okay, two things.

41:24.899 --> 41:25.733
One...

41:26.692 --> 41:27.693
friends.

41:28.194 --> 41:29.778
Okay, friends can be good.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.906
We can just call this a friendship.

41:32.531 --> 41:33.616
That might help.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.618
Okay, great.

41:36.410 --> 41:38.162
Poof, friends.

41:40.539 --> 41:41.415
And two...

41:42.833 --> 41:44.460
I felt the same way about James.

41:45.628 --> 41:49.006
And I don't want to sound corny,
but I did this thing,

41:49.089 --> 41:52.092
where I took a bunch of his stuff
and I put in a box and I...

41:52.760 --> 41:53.969
let it go in the ocean.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.683
I'm not really one to hold on to things.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.727
It's not...  Um...

42:03.395 --> 42:05.147
You could just, you know, write a note.

42:06.524 --> 42:07.483
A goodbye.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.195
Burn it.

42:11.737 --> 42:12.696
Something.

42:13.364 --> 42:14.448
And I would help you.

42:16.951 --> 42:18.369
Friends support each other.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.205
<i> Whatever you call us...</i>

42:22.081 --> 42:23.541
<i>-it feels right.</i>

42:24.708 --> 42:26.377
<i>Because we're an "us."</i>

42:29.338 --> 42:31.799
<i>And if we are an "us,"</i>

42:32.299 --> 42:34.593
<i>then, dare I say it...</i>

42:35.094 --> 42:35.928
<i>this...</i>

42:36.512 --> 42:38.556
<i>this is home for now.</i>

42:41.100 --> 42:43.185
<i>And I should probably be a good neighbor.</i>

42:44.937 --> 42:45.813
Oh...

42:46.897 --> 42:49.233
Try that guy.
These two are full and that one--

42:49.316 --> 42:50.568
Eats the quarters, yeah.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.613
You don't have to be all nice.

42:55.864 --> 42:58.117
I feel bad, like I did something.

42:58.200 --> 43:01.620
No, it's not you, you were just
in the line of fire when Henderson...

43:02.538 --> 43:05.499
We go back.
We met, like, eight years ago

43:05.583 --> 43:07.459
when I was dancing at this bar downtown.

43:09.086 --> 43:12.548
Not just to do it, but because I was
actually pursuing something.

43:13.382 --> 43:15.551
I wanted to be Carrie Fisher.
She's such a great writer.

43:16.218 --> 43:18.554
But I was stuck in Covina
and my mom was such a cunt,

43:18.637 --> 43:20.389
and one day, I was just like, "Fuck it.

43:20.472 --> 43:22.224
Let me get a fake ID and get out of here

43:22.308 --> 43:23.559
and go follow my dreams."

43:24.018 --> 43:25.769
<i> It's hard to imagine her</i>
<i>with dreams.</i>

43:25.853 --> 43:26.687
Henderson was cool.

43:26.770 --> 43:30.357
He, like, gave me copies
of Syd Field, <i>Save the Cat.</i>

43:31.609 --> 43:33.444
And he was like, "You're actually good,"

43:33.527 --> 43:34.612
which nobody ever...

43:39.533 --> 43:41.076
And I had heard, or whatever,

43:41.160 --> 43:43.329
that he had young girls around,

43:43.412 --> 43:46.540
but I just thought
I was talented and special.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.335
One day, I was at his place,

43:49.418 --> 43:52.338
and I had, like, three sips of beer,

43:52.755 --> 43:54.798
and I got so fucked up.

43:56.592 --> 43:58.093
Eight years ago? You were, like--

43:58.177 --> 43:59.386
Seventeen.

44:00.137 --> 44:02.097
Anyway, I remember being like,

44:02.181 --> 44:03.599
"How is it ten p.m.?"

44:03.682 --> 44:05.976
And I look down and...

44:06.685 --> 44:08.562
my skirt was pulled up.

44:10.147 --> 44:11.732
So you're saying Henderson--

44:11.815 --> 44:13.567
Or, hey, maybe my skirt just rode up.

44:15.319 --> 44:16.570
Have you ever tried...?

44:17.029 --> 44:18.781
To what? Tell anyone? No.

44:19.365 --> 44:20.324
Who?

44:20.407 --> 44:22.951
I tried to do a story years later,
but nobody would talk to me.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.995
Guess why? They're all like I was.

44:25.496 --> 44:26.413
Underage...

44:26.872 --> 44:27.748
strippers...

44:28.123 --> 44:29.166
not white...

44:29.792 --> 44:31.168
The world would eat them alive.

44:33.212 --> 44:35.422
And that's why I don't lose
a drop of sleep

44:35.506 --> 44:37.174
on any of these motherfuckers
I write about.

44:37.257 --> 44:38.342
They all deserve it.

44:39.218 --> 44:42.763
My math says 49% of humanity
deserves to die in a fire.

44:45.641 --> 44:48.060
Don't do that. You, like...

44:48.560 --> 44:50.604
You nod as if you're somehow
not one of them.

44:51.105 --> 44:53.357
Well, let me give you the gift of honesty.

44:53.649 --> 44:54.525
You...

44:54.942 --> 44:57.277
act nice because you're not.

44:57.986 --> 45:00.239
And I may not know
what kind of bad you are...

45:01.407 --> 45:03.158
but I got my radar the hard way.

45:03.992 --> 45:04.827
So...

45:05.953 --> 45:08.288
stay the fuck away from me
and my sister, okay?

45:10.624 --> 45:11.834
Have a fantastic day.

45:29.685 --> 45:31.103
Tell me I didn't eat those.

45:34.022 --> 45:35.065
Do you know...

45:35.733 --> 45:38.652
how much oxidative stress
those things put on your body?

45:39.611 --> 45:41.572
I'm guessing a shower
is out of the question?

45:57.963 --> 45:59.923
Did you say Jasper came around?

46:00.507 --> 46:01.467
I paid the man.

46:01.633 --> 46:03.010
And he went on his way.

46:05.095 --> 46:07.890
If things were different,
I'd say I owe you 50 grand.

46:07.973 --> 46:10.058
-Why? You got it laying around somewhere?
-Nice try.

46:10.976 --> 46:11.852
It's spent.

46:13.896 --> 46:15.773
-What were you thinking?
-Honestly...

46:18.525 --> 46:20.235
a little while ago I fell in love.

46:21.487 --> 46:22.529
And she needed help.

46:23.989 --> 46:25.032
So I just did it.

46:35.292 --> 46:37.336
You've been putting meds
in my drinks, huh?

46:37.419 --> 46:38.295
That's green juice.

46:39.588 --> 46:40.422
Thanks.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.760
Well, my current reality is...

46:45.135 --> 46:47.387
suboptimal, but even so,

46:47.471 --> 46:48.889
upgrade from where I was.

46:50.516 --> 46:52.851
At one point,
I thought I saw you murder a guy.

46:59.107 --> 46:59.942
Crazy town.

47:01.318 --> 47:02.528
Well, glad to have you back.

47:13.038 --> 47:15.082
<i> I guess it's goodbye, Beck.</i>

47:18.627 --> 47:19.461
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

47:20.754 --> 47:21.713
<i>I really am.</i>

47:23.757 --> 47:25.300
<i>Goodbye, you.</i>

47:30.180 --> 47:31.139
How did that feel?

47:33.892 --> 47:35.185
Like a good first step.

47:36.979 --> 47:40.023
<i>Still can't wait to tell our story</i>
<i>to our kids.</i>

47:40.816 --> 47:43.360
<i>How we decided to walk before we ran.</i>

47:44.027 --> 47:45.529
<i>Started out as friends.</i>

47:51.618 --> 47:52.494
<i>The past...</i>

47:53.370 --> 47:54.413
<i>is prologue.</i>

47:55.706 --> 47:58.083
<i>I made mistakes, yes.</i>

47:59.084 --> 48:00.961
<i>And I'll learn from them.</i>

48:02.754 --> 48:03.672
<i>Prove...</i>

48:04.381 --> 48:05.382
<i>I'm worthy...</i>

48:05.924 --> 48:06.800
<i>of you.</i>

48:16.768 --> 48:18.729
Hey, should I open another bottle?

48:30.490 --> 48:32.075
<i> I know we'll get there.</i>

48:33.410 --> 48:34.661
<i>I'm optimistic.</i>

48:35.537 --> 48:36.455
<i>It's just...</i>

48:38.206 --> 48:39.249
<i>who I am.</i>
