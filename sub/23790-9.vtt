I cannot believe these words
I'm about to say,

14:01.841 --> 14:03.384
but I believe them to be accurate.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.679
[exhales]

14:06.762 --> 14:08.347
I think Emaline Adaria likes me.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.640
[chuckles]

14:11.517 --> 14:14.061
-No, she doesn't.
-Yeah, but what if she does?

14:14.144 --> 14:15.521
Shh!

14:17.314 --> 14:21.485
Even if I'm wrong, I would rather feel
a sense of shame and regret for failing

14:21.569 --> 14:23.237
than not trying at all.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.739
Tyler, please.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.617
What do you need help with?

14:30.369 --> 14:32.162
I need to know how to dress cool.

14:32.746 --> 14:35.082
Ex-squeeze me, of baking powder?

14:35.165 --> 14:38.085
Okay, you have style... kind of.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.295
I do not.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.548
That, and I literally
have no one else to ask.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.009
Okay.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.970
Oh, great. Great, thank you.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.890
Okay, we'll go shopping
before the premiere. Cool.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.893
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
I taped<i> Mystery Sci--</i>

14:53.976 --> 14:57.229
Sorry, no time for kid stuff.
I have to plan what I'm gonna say!

14:57.938 --> 14:58.981
Sorry.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.576
That was cruddy.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.453
I'm sorry.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.374
How come
I'm losing all my friends to girls?

15:17.958 --> 15:20.961
-Is it me?
-No, definitely not.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.505
You shouldn't blame yourself.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.467
Truth be told, you never stood a chance.

15:26.550 --> 15:31.972
The female species is extremely powerful
and highly mysterious.

15:33.557 --> 15:37.102
Sometimes, we quietly saddle up,
right next to you,

15:37.186 --> 15:41.065
and before you even know it, you're ours.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.108
Like a spider.

15:43.859 --> 15:44.777
Yeah.

15:45.569 --> 15:48.030
My friends have been eaten by spiders.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.657
This sucks the big one.

15:52.242 --> 15:55.079
Yeah, I know how you feel.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.915
I pretty much don't have any friends.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.625
So...

16:01.919 --> 16:03.045
[chuckles]

16:04.713 --> 16:05.798
See ya, Leslie.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.177
[bell ringing]

16:19.895 --> 16:20.729
Dad?

16:21.063 --> 16:22.898
Hm? Oh.

16:24.858 --> 16:25.901
What are you doing?

16:26.235 --> 16:28.612
I-I was just getting a drink of water.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.783
Are you okay?

16:33.283 --> 16:34.451
Yeah.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.622
Things didn't work out
with that... that lady I was seeing.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.916
But, you know, it's no big deal.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.086
Wanna talk about it?

16:45.212 --> 16:50.092
No, you know, uh, maybe just
treat me like the principal today.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.728
Hey.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.688
I just saw your dad.

17:02.771 --> 17:03.939
You ready?

17:06.066 --> 17:08.235
I can't hang out today.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.570
Why not?

17:09.653 --> 17:12.072
There's something I have to do,
it's not you.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.617
-I promise, I, I really...
-Kate, it's okay, I get it.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.619
Rain check?

17:18.370 --> 17:19.455
Yeah.

17:20.831 --> 17:21.999
Thanks.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.146
What do you want?

17:45.564 --> 17:47.316
Come. I have something to show you.

17:47.399 --> 17:51.195
Absolutely not, I don't have one good take
of Tyler saying his line right.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.238
The aliens look like Sesame Street,

17:53.322 --> 17:56.450
and this asteroid belt thing,
it doesn't make any sense.

17:56.533 --> 17:59.286
The room is off-limits, Kate.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.288
-I-- What the hell!
-[tape stops]

18:01.371 --> 18:02.414
Luke...

18:03.123 --> 18:04.792
I said, come with me.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.685
[Luke] We're stopping here?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.980
Kate, this is what you pulled me away for?

18:28.315 --> 18:29.650
Unbelievable.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.154
So...

18:35.405 --> 18:38.075
the best memory I have of my mom...

18:40.119 --> 18:42.871
was this one day
she took me to the county fair.

18:44.998 --> 18:49.586
She checked me out of school that morning,
and told them we had a family commitment,

18:50.295 --> 18:52.047
and we just went.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.674
Just the two of us.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.010
I remember feeding the goats
in the petting zoo

18:57.094 --> 18:59.680
and the way my mom laughed
when they licked at her palms.

19:01.890 --> 19:06.603
At one point, I got lost in the fun house
and I started crying,

19:06.687 --> 19:08.689
so she bought me balloons.

19:09.857 --> 19:13.110
And then, we were
at the highest point of the Ferris wheel.

19:16.238 --> 19:19.074
And she told me to let them go.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.035
So I did.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.705
She said to me,

19:24.788 --> 19:27.541
"Kate, just because you can't see them,

19:28.250 --> 19:30.377
doesn't mean they aren't still there."

19:33.922 --> 19:35.757
She just held me.

19:37.759 --> 19:41.555
That night we got home
and she cooked us spaghetti.

19:42.139 --> 19:47.394
But, it was surprising,
because she hadn't cooked in months.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.940
And then she asked us
if we wanted ice cream.

19:53.066 --> 19:56.278
She got the keys and left to go get some.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.575
And she drove out here...

20:02.534 --> 20:03.911
to this bridge.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.334
And she stopped her car
in the middle of the road.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.839
And she climbed over the railing...

20:18.884 --> 20:20.552
and she let go.

20:22.721 --> 20:29.311
In the obituary, my dad just said
her death was... related to illness.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.398
So, you see...

20:37.152 --> 20:39.071
I don't have the luxury...

20:39.905 --> 20:44.243
[fighting tears] of getting mad at my mom
over petty bullshit.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.082
I just have a dad.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.045
[sniffles]
And I don't know what you did...

20:56.004 --> 20:59.091
to screw up the happiness
he found with your mom.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.387
I'm so mad at you, Luke.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.727
You're not the only one
having a hard time.
