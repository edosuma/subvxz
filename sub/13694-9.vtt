WEBVTT

00:04.006 --> 00:07.260
-Is she there?
-Yep, five pages.

00:07.343 --> 00:10.263
(GASPS)

00:10.346 --> 00:12.682
-PHOTOGRAPHER: Try not
to blink. Don't worry.
-Can I blink now?

00:12.765 --> 00:15.309
-(SHUTTER CLICKING)
-I've never done this
before, so...

00:15.393 --> 00:19.689
"Lexie MacDonald,
Glenbogle's first lady laird."

00:19.772 --> 00:23.234
-Relax. Don't look
too serious. That's good.
-I don't feel very relaxed.

00:23.317 --> 00:25.361
-PHOTOGRAPHER: That's perfect.
Good.
-Just put my hand here?

00:25.445 --> 00:29.073
"Since taking over,
Lexie has raised the profile
of sleepy Glenbogle."

00:31.993 --> 00:33.286
Too much smile? Okay.

00:33.369 --> 00:35.788
PAUL: "'Visitor numbers
are climbing,'
laughs Lexie,

00:35.872 --> 00:38.791
"'because you've
given the place
a wake-up call.'"

00:38.875 --> 00:41.669
-PHOTOGRAPHER: Turn that
the other way up.
-Oh.

00:41.753 --> 00:44.464
-Turn just a little bit more.
Good girl.
-That way?

00:44.547 --> 00:46.799
I'll stand up. Sorry.

00:46.883 --> 00:49.427
DUNCAN: "Lexie's house
has its own special ambiance."

00:49.510 --> 00:53.264
-Ambiance?
-They mean the fire engine.

00:53.348 --> 00:57.852
"Locals have started
to call her
the Queen of Glenbogle."

00:59.479 --> 01:01.981
That's lovely, Lexie.
Gorgeous.

01:02.065 --> 01:04.608
PAUL: "Lexie, with her
customary charm
and elegance..."

01:04.691 --> 01:05.777
Is that the magazine?

01:07.820 --> 01:09.697
Let me see it.
Thank you.

01:12.241 --> 01:14.911
"The Queen of Glenbogle"?

01:16.788 --> 01:18.456
That's not me.

01:18.539 --> 01:21.334
It is now.
Good morning, Your Majesty.

01:23.086 --> 01:25.171
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:00.665 --> 02:02.834
-DUNCAN: Here she comes.
-Morning.

02:02.917 --> 02:04.836
-Morning.
-Hi.

02:06.379 --> 02:08.506
ALL: Your Highness.

02:08.589 --> 02:10.633
(CHUCKLING SARCASTICALLY)
Stop that.

02:10.717 --> 02:13.094
I never said
any of those things.

02:14.762 --> 02:17.724
I only did it
to raise the profile
of the place.

02:17.807 --> 02:20.518
And attracting more visitors
can't be a bad thing, either.

02:20.601 --> 02:23.021
Well, there'll be
no shortage of those
over the next few days.

02:23.104 --> 02:26.774
Exactly. Right, okay,
any questions?

02:26.858 --> 02:31.070
-EWAN: What is a
"clan gathering"?
-Ah, it's when the clan...

02:32.405 --> 02:33.865
...gathers.

02:33.948 --> 02:36.034
EWAN: For what?

02:36.117 --> 02:38.578
It's something MacDonalds
have a compulsive urge to do
every five years.

02:38.661 --> 02:42.373
And this year
is going to be
the best year ever.

02:42.457 --> 02:46.127
Now, the first of our guests
will be arriving
very shortly.

02:46.210 --> 02:47.879
I thought they weren't coming
till Saturday.

02:47.962 --> 02:49.922
Well, some people like to
make a weekend of it.

02:50.006 --> 02:52.216
You know, it is
the highlight
of their social calendar.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.552
How sad is that?

02:54.635 --> 02:56.929
And I don't want anyone
going to be disappointed,

02:57.013 --> 02:59.724
thinking I can't cut it
as a laird.

02:59.807 --> 03:02.977
But I can't do it
all on my own,
more's the pity.

03:03.061 --> 03:05.646
LEXIE: Molly, now,
you have to tell me
who people are.

03:05.730 --> 03:10.360
I'll do my best,
but they're nearly all
called MacDonald.

03:10.443 --> 03:14.572
Ewan, I need you to sort out
a delivery of fuel
for the range before Saturday.

03:14.655 --> 03:18.284
I don't see why
we have to have caterers in.
I'm the chef.

03:18.368 --> 03:22.246
And it is your first week,
so don't try and run
before you can walk.

03:23.247 --> 03:25.541
Now, Paul.

03:25.624 --> 03:28.294
-Where's Paul?
-He had to go over
to the distillery.

03:29.003 --> 03:30.713
Again?

03:30.797 --> 03:33.758
He does take
his responsibilities as
a board member very seriously.

03:33.841 --> 03:37.679
Mmm. Especially when
it involves liaising
with a certain chairperson.

03:37.762 --> 03:42.225
-(CAR HORN HONKING)
-Right, let's go.

03:51.234 --> 03:56.155
-Charles,
how lovely to see you.
-And you too, Molly.

03:56.239 --> 03:58.990
-Now, where's our host?
-Have you not met Lexie?

03:59.617 --> 04:00.868
-Hi.
-Hello.

04:00.952 --> 04:03.079
Archie's abroad,
so I'm standing in for him.

04:03.161 --> 04:07.166
Clan gathering
without a laird?
Unconventional.

04:07.250 --> 04:10.712
Well, you've got me.
Temporary acting laird.

04:10.795 --> 04:15.049
-But you're not a MacDonald.
-I was the last time I read
my marriage certificate.

04:15.133 --> 04:18.261
I beg your pardon.
Charles MacDonald
of Castle MacDonald.

04:18.344 --> 04:19.553
Proud to be at your service.

04:19.637 --> 04:22.432
Er, you don't have to kneel.

04:22.515 --> 04:25.058
It's traditional
when greeting the new laird.

04:25.143 --> 04:28.563
Oh! For a moment there,
I thought you were going to
ask me to marry you.

04:28.645 --> 04:32.650
-(LEXIE LAUGHING)
-Well, I like to observe
the proper etiquette.

04:32.734 --> 04:35.820
Well, I'm sure you'll keep us
up to the mark.

04:36.571 --> 04:38.406
Nice car.

04:38.489 --> 04:41.784
My cases are in the boot.
Will you have them taken
up to my room?

04:51.044 --> 04:53.254
Thanks for coming with me.
I couldn't face it on my own.

04:53.338 --> 04:56.591
Oh, it's a pleasure.
Well, not a pleasure,
but, you know...

04:56.674 --> 04:58.718
(AMANDA CHUCKLING)

04:58.801 --> 05:03.014
So that's my dad.
Not very dignified, is it?

05:03.097 --> 05:05.433
Have you any plans
for scattering the ashes?

05:05.516 --> 05:09.604
Well, I sort of had an idea,
but I wanted to talk to you
about it.

05:23.117 --> 05:26.579
PAUL: Beautiful, isn't it?

05:26.662 --> 05:29.040
AMANDA: I came here
a couple of times with my dad
when I was little.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.669
I remember him building me
a sand castle.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.713
He used to love fishing here.

05:36.756 --> 05:38.383
Did you do
lots of stuff together?

05:38.466 --> 05:41.010
Not really.
Not enough, anyway.

05:41.094 --> 05:43.971
Went away to boarding school
when I was 12.

05:44.055 --> 05:45.430
Were you an only child?

05:46.557 --> 05:48.226
Not a son, though.

05:48.309 --> 05:50.228
Was that a problem?

05:50.311 --> 05:52.146
I think it was, for him.

05:52.230 --> 05:55.525
I always felt, somehow,
I'd let him down.

05:55.608 --> 05:58.236
That's why
I'd like to get this right.

05:58.319 --> 06:01.364
This place was
so special to him.
It'd be perfect.

06:02.865 --> 06:05.451
When do you want to
hold the ceremony?

06:05.535 --> 06:07.620
My aunt and uncle
are staying with me
this weekend,

06:07.704 --> 06:11.416
so if I could ask people
for Saturday...

06:11.498 --> 06:15.795
There's something going on
up at the house,
but I'm sure that'll be fine.

06:16.671 --> 06:18.506
Thanks, Paul.

06:18.589 --> 06:21.634
You'll have to do me
a favour in return, though.

06:21.718 --> 06:25.513
Will you be my guest
for dinner tonight
as part of this clan thing?

06:25.596 --> 06:27.098
I'd love to.

06:27.181 --> 06:28.224
Good.

06:32.061 --> 06:35.064
(SIGHING)
So what am I supposed to say?

06:35.148 --> 06:38.359
"Oh, sorry, folks.
I know I've only been
in charge for five minutes,

06:38.443 --> 06:39.819
"but I've lost our
oldest heirloom."

06:39.902 --> 06:42.363
I promise that I'll find it.

06:42.447 --> 06:43.823
Please.

06:48.995 --> 06:50.747
What's wrong?

06:50.830 --> 06:54.375
I've lost the quaich.
You know, the loving cup.

06:54.459 --> 06:57.211
It's been used at
every clan gathering since...

06:57.295 --> 06:59.756
Well, since there was
a clan gathering.

06:59.839 --> 07:03.009
Lexie's so determined
to make the whole thing
a success.

07:03.092 --> 07:05.887
I just can't think where
I would have put it.

07:05.970 --> 07:07.804
Have you looked in the cellar?

07:07.889 --> 07:09.515
Ah, now that is a good idea.

07:11.184 --> 07:13.936
Thank you, Golly. I don't know
what I'd do without you.

07:18.274 --> 07:19.859
Are you sure you
can manage two at once?

07:19.942 --> 07:21.611
I've got a sore shoulder.

07:21.694 --> 07:22.737
You're such a big wuss.

07:22.820 --> 07:24.572
All right, Wonder Woman.

07:26.866 --> 07:29.952
Actually, Jess,
I was meaning
to ask you something.

07:30.661 --> 07:32.163
Oh?

07:32.246 --> 07:36.709
Well, I was
thinking about us.
I mean, you and me.

07:36.793 --> 07:39.796
We make a pretty good team,
don't we? At work, I mean.

07:40.421 --> 07:41.506
Yeah.

07:41.589 --> 07:42.757
And we're friends.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.718
I mean, good friends.

07:45.802 --> 07:47.804
Yeah, no, definitely
really good friends.

07:47.887 --> 07:50.973
So I was wondering...
Well, hoping, really...

07:51.057 --> 07:52.058
GOLLY: Jess!

07:54.811 --> 07:57.397
Jess, I need you to help me
move the wine in the cellar.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.856
All of it?

07:58.940 --> 08:01.567
MacDonald quaich may be there.
Molly's looking for it.

08:01.651 --> 08:03.027
What about the chairs?

08:03.111 --> 08:04.153
GOLLY: Oh, you can
do that later.

08:05.113 --> 08:06.239
Come on.

08:06.322 --> 08:09.283
Of course. We can't keep
Molly waiting, can we?

08:09.367 --> 08:12.412
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-Yes, come in.

08:13.788 --> 08:16.833
Ah, so this is
where you've been hiding.

08:18.418 --> 08:21.504
I'm sorry.
I still have an estate to run.

08:21.587 --> 08:23.214
Do you not have
people to do that?

08:23.715 --> 08:25.216
I wish!

08:25.299 --> 08:26.884
Well, I've had
a good look round.

08:26.968 --> 08:29.846
The wolf park,
the visitor centre,
the climbing school...

08:31.014 --> 08:32.765
Your husband
certainly has vision.

08:32.849 --> 08:34.683
Yeah, well, he had some help.

08:36.102 --> 08:38.187
CHARLES: You're managing
all right, are you?

08:38.270 --> 08:42.525
A prestigious event like this,
it's a lot for a young woman
like yourself to take on.

08:42.607 --> 08:45.319
Um, yeah, I can manage.

08:45.403 --> 08:47.530
I even have
some ideas of my own.

08:47.613 --> 08:48.990
Really?

08:49.073 --> 08:51.909
Yeah. Well, this year,
our guests can take home

08:51.993 --> 08:55.663
a MacDonald Clan Gathering
commemorative video.

08:55.746 --> 08:57.874
I've hired a film crew
for the weekend.

08:57.956 --> 09:00.918
Hardly the most
traditional keepsake.

09:01.002 --> 09:03.545
I just wonder
if you shouldn't be paying
a wee bit more attention

09:03.629 --> 09:07.508
to the main event
rather than wasting your time
on all these fripperies.

09:07.592 --> 09:09.635
(SCOFFS)
I'm sorry?

09:09.719 --> 09:11.596
This is not a criticism,

09:11.679 --> 09:16.392
but the clan banner
on the flagstaff
is flying upside down.

09:16.476 --> 09:20.688
Right, well, yeah,
I'll make sure someone
goes up and changes that.

09:20.772 --> 09:24.108
CHARLES: It's perfectly
understandable.
You're new to the family.

09:24.192 --> 09:27.820
I'm more concerned
with the welcome message
in my room,

09:27.904 --> 09:30.156
and, I assume,
those of the other guests.

09:30.239 --> 09:32.533
You ran it off on your
personal computer, did you?

09:32.617 --> 09:34.577
Yeah.
It was the scribe's day off.

09:35.828 --> 09:37.455
There are two
spelling mistakes,

09:37.538 --> 09:39.791
three errors
of historical fact,

09:39.874 --> 09:44.712
and one grammatical infelicity
in the final sentence. There,
I've marked them for you.

09:44.796 --> 09:49.592
Again, not your fault. I had
the benefit of an education
at Gordonstoun and Cambridge.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.844
Mmm, lucky you.

09:51.928 --> 09:56.432
Well, I'll keep my eyes open
and report back if I notice
anything else amiss.

09:56.516 --> 09:59.102
Yes, that would be very kind.

09:59.185 --> 10:00.520
Not at all.

10:05.483 --> 10:07.360
See, when you were
in the army,

10:07.443 --> 10:10.655
did they teach that thing
where you can just
kill a man with a single blow?

10:11.614 --> 10:12.740
No, we had guns.

10:12.824 --> 10:15.702
Oh, shame. No...

10:15.785 --> 10:19.497
I am going to act
like a laird. I'm not going to
let him get to me.

10:19.580 --> 10:22.625
I'm going to be refined.
I am going to be polite.

10:22.709 --> 10:23.876
Oh, aye?

10:23.960 --> 10:25.837
Well, for the next
few days, anyway.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.423
So, what can I do
for you, sir?

10:28.506 --> 10:31.884
Amanda wants to scatter
her father's ashes in the loch
this Saturday.

10:31.968 --> 10:34.137
But that's when we're having
the clan banquet.

10:34.220 --> 10:37.640
Yeah, I know. But that'll be
up at the house, where she'll
be at the far end of the loch.

10:37.724 --> 10:41.936
Yeah, yeah, okay.
But I've got so much
on my plate this weekend.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.312
Will you take care of it?

10:43.396 --> 10:44.772
No problem.

10:44.856 --> 10:48.276
Good. Means you'll get to
spend more time with Amanda.

10:48.359 --> 10:49.402
PAUL: Oh. I can hack that.

10:51.237 --> 10:53.072
What?

10:53.156 --> 10:55.158
-We're just friends.
-(LEXIE CHUCKLING)

10:57.952 --> 11:01.080
-(SIGHING)
It really isn't here.
-It must be.

11:01.164 --> 11:04.375
Well, we'd have
found it by now.
It must be someplace else.

11:04.459 --> 11:06.669
He's right. I'm so sorry.

11:06.753 --> 11:10.798
Archie sent the cup to London
to be cleaned and repaired.
I'd completely forgotten.

11:10.882 --> 11:12.467
Oh. Can't they send it back?

11:12.550 --> 11:14.635
MOLLY: It'd never be here
soon enough.

11:14.719 --> 11:18.181
We'll just have to
do without it. I am so sorry
to have wasted your time.

11:18.264 --> 11:20.641
That's not a problem, Molly.

11:20.725 --> 11:21.893
(SIGHING)

11:23.519 --> 11:26.314
Anyway, we'd better
get this lot moved back.

11:26.397 --> 11:29.025
And after you tried
so hard, Dad.

11:35.573 --> 11:36.657
Where's the chef?

11:36.741 --> 11:37.825
Who's asking?

11:37.909 --> 11:39.243
I beg your pardon?

11:39.327 --> 11:40.620
You're talking to him, pal.

11:40.703 --> 11:43.122
No, I mean "the chef."

11:45.416 --> 11:46.459
What's the problem?

11:48.211 --> 11:51.172
I'd like to review the menu
for this evening.

11:51.255 --> 11:53.257
-You're joking.
-No.

11:53.341 --> 11:55.176
It's important you serve
the correct fare.

11:55.259 --> 11:58.137
Correct fare?
It's a dinner, not a bus.

11:58.221 --> 12:01.849
Mrs MacDonald has asked me
to supervise.

12:01.933 --> 12:03.893
Like, she's put you
in charge of me?

12:03.976 --> 12:05.019
Menu, please.

12:15.196 --> 12:17.281
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

12:18.533 --> 12:20.618
Okay, well,
dinner will be served tonight

12:20.702 --> 12:23.329
and you've got plenty of time
to explore the estate
tomorrow.

12:23.413 --> 12:25.707
And if you need anything,
then just ask.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.291
Unbelievable!

12:27.375 --> 12:30.670
You spend 300 quid
on a mobile
that can send video

12:30.753 --> 12:33.006
and tell you
what the weather's like
in Kuala Lumpur,

12:33.089 --> 12:35.466
but can you make
a phone call, hm?

12:35.550 --> 12:37.176
Are those
your film people, dear?

12:37.260 --> 12:41.889
You know the face,
and the name's on the tip
of your tongue. Right?

12:43.349 --> 12:45.685
-Mike Baxter.
-Hi, I'm Lexie.

12:45.768 --> 12:47.937
You're very sexy, Lexie.

12:48.021 --> 12:50.481
-And you can call me
Mrs MacDonald.
-Ah.

12:50.565 --> 12:53.192
Now, you're late,
so you'll probably want
to get started.

12:53.276 --> 12:55.361
Maybe get some pictures
of people arriving?

12:55.445 --> 12:57.488
Ah, darling, please.

12:57.572 --> 12:59.866
I did have my own
late-night show on Grampian.

12:59.949 --> 13:02.827
Just you leave
all that technical stuff
to me and my crew.

13:02.910 --> 13:06.748
You go ahead
and enjoy your party,
and pretend we're not here.

13:08.833 --> 13:09.876
Are you off somewhere?

13:09.959 --> 13:12.003
London.
Going to collect the quaich.

13:12.086 --> 13:13.379
You're kidding!

13:13.463 --> 13:15.089
The gathering wouldn't be
the same without it

13:15.173 --> 13:17.759
and I can be down there
tomorrow morning,
and back the day after.

13:17.842 --> 13:20.053
Dad, they've got
courier services that do that.

13:20.136 --> 13:23.097
I know, I know,
but I'd rather do it myself.

13:23.181 --> 13:27.852
I want this to be a surprise
for Molly, so don't tell her
where I've gone.

13:27.935 --> 13:29.312
Okay. What if she asks?

13:29.395 --> 13:31.189
(SIGHING)

13:31.272 --> 13:33.733
Just tell her I'm working
on the far side of the estate,
or something.

13:33.816 --> 13:36.444
And listen,
you behave yourself.

13:36.527 --> 13:38.571
Like there's a whole load
of ways to misbehave
around here.

13:38.654 --> 13:40.239
You know what I mean.

13:40.323 --> 13:43.201
I told you, there's nothing
going on between
me and Duncan, okay?

13:43.284 --> 13:47.038
Yeah, well,
let's just keep it that way.

13:47.121 --> 13:50.541
Okay, that's me.
I shall see you tomorrow,

13:51.626 --> 13:53.586
or Saturday.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.799
Dad?

13:57.882 --> 14:01.636
I know why you're doing this.
It's not for the sake
of the clan.

14:02.553 --> 14:04.639
It's for Molly.

14:04.722 --> 14:06.849
Maybe you should
tell her that.

14:14.315 --> 14:17.235
I'm not changing the menu,
and that's that.

14:17.318 --> 14:19.070
What's going on?

14:19.153 --> 14:21.406
EWAN: He doesn't like
our menu.

14:21.489 --> 14:23.449
What's wrong with the menu?

14:23.533 --> 14:24.826
CHARLES: Pasta.

14:24.909 --> 14:27.870
Why, have we run out? Or...

14:27.954 --> 14:31.040
Potatoes, porridge,
oatcakes and rolls

14:31.124 --> 14:34.752
are all acceptable
carbohydrates
at a clan gathering.

14:34.836 --> 14:38.840
Pasta is not.
We're the MacDonalds,
not the Corleones.

14:38.923 --> 14:40.550
(LEXIE SPLUTTERING)

14:40.633 --> 14:43.469
Okay, okay.
Wouldn't want
to disappoint anyone.

14:43.553 --> 14:46.639
Ah, Ewan, we'll serve
boiled potatoes
with the salmon tonight.

14:46.723 --> 14:49.100
What, and
throw all this away?

14:49.183 --> 14:52.520
Yes.
Can you just do it, please?

14:52.603 --> 14:54.939
(QUIETER) I don't want that
to be included in the film.

14:55.023 --> 14:57.525
(SIGHING)
I don't believe this.

14:57.608 --> 15:00.737
Okay, problem solved.
Now, anything else, Charles?

15:00.820 --> 15:02.488
As a matter of fact,
there was.

15:04.323 --> 15:06.159
Lagganmore whisky.

15:06.242 --> 15:08.453
Would you like a wee dram?
I'll just get you a glass.

15:08.536 --> 15:10.455
CHARLES: Certainly not!

15:10.538 --> 15:14.000
You do know
that the distillery is owned
by the MacLeish family?

15:14.083 --> 15:16.836
Yes. We do have a seat
on the board.

15:16.919 --> 15:18.796
Then it's even worse
than I thought.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.090
Do you know nothing
about the history of the clan?

15:21.174 --> 15:23.217
(CLEARING THROAT)
Obviously not.

15:24.052 --> 15:25.928
There has been a feud

15:26.012 --> 15:30.016
between the MacDonalds
and the MacLeishes
for 400 years.

15:30.099 --> 15:32.810
Your predecessor,
the seventh laird,

15:32.894 --> 15:34.896
swore a solemn
and binding oath.

15:34.979 --> 15:37.857
From that day to this,
we've been at war.

15:37.940 --> 15:42.987
Well, I did not know that.
But nobody takes that stuff
seriously any more.

15:43.071 --> 15:48.201
Well. It's mattered
to 12 generations
of your adopted family.

15:48.284 --> 15:50.453
It should matter to you!

15:55.833 --> 15:57.210
Golly!

15:59.671 --> 16:03.091
-He's gone to London.
-Right, and I'm David Beckham.

16:03.174 --> 16:06.260
He has. Did you see
the pickup outside?

16:06.344 --> 16:08.471
Golly doesn't do travel.

16:08.554 --> 16:11.683
Except as a surprise
for Molly. We're supposed to
keep it a secret, though.

16:12.892 --> 16:15.395
Oh, aye?

16:15.478 --> 16:19.399
So... Are you doing anything
this evening, then?

16:19.482 --> 16:22.402
Er, no, nothing at the moment,
I think.

16:22.485 --> 16:25.488
Good, 'cause then
I could come round
and visit you.

16:25.571 --> 16:29.784
I mean, keep you company.
Unless, of course, you want
the place to yourself.

16:29.867 --> 16:32.078
No, no, that would be
really nice. Yeah.

16:34.497 --> 16:36.833
Well, you know,
I might see you later, then.

16:37.375 --> 16:38.376
Maybe.

16:39.752 --> 16:41.045
Bye, then.

17:02.025 --> 17:06.445
Whoa, what have you done?
Never looks like this
when Golly's here.

17:06.529 --> 17:07.571
Do you not like it?

17:07.655 --> 17:09.781
DUNCAN: No, no, it's great.

17:09.866 --> 17:14.037
Something smells good.
Er, not you. The cooking.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.289
Not that you don't smell good.
What I mean is that you...

17:16.372 --> 17:19.916
-Sometimes,
I think you smell...
-Duncan... Just shut up.

17:22.502 --> 17:23.880
You know
what I'm trying to say.

17:25.882 --> 17:29.385
We don't often get the chance
to be alone together.

17:31.471 --> 17:32.889
We have now.

17:34.974 --> 17:36.434
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

17:37.477 --> 17:39.145
(SIGHING)

17:41.189 --> 17:43.399
Two and a half hours it's
taken me to find this place.

17:43.483 --> 17:46.486
-I gave them directions.
-No one told me.

17:46.569 --> 17:49.655
Sign here.
It's a self-installation job,

17:49.739 --> 17:52.157
so I'll leave that
to your husband.

17:52.241 --> 17:54.410
No, I'm perfectly capable.

17:54.493 --> 17:57.163
No need to ask who wears
the trousers here, eh?

18:01.167 --> 18:03.044
Is he calling me a wuss?

18:03.127 --> 18:04.920
Don't worry, Duncan,
I'll let you help.

18:05.004 --> 18:06.213
DUNCAN: What is it?

18:06.297 --> 18:08.424
It's a washing machine.

18:08.508 --> 18:12.929
Dad is going to kill me.
You know that he still washes
all of his stuff by hand?

18:13.012 --> 18:14.639
He didn't see why we need one.

18:15.306 --> 18:16.557
Come on.

18:18.685 --> 18:22.647
-CHARLES: You must visit
Castle MacDonald.
-That would be marvellous.

18:22.730 --> 18:25.900
Who knows, we might even
have the clan gathering there,
one day.

18:25.983 --> 18:27.944
No, no, it's always been
at Glenbogle.

18:28.027 --> 18:30.363
Oh, of course, but you know,

18:30.446 --> 18:35.910
it's the clan that decides
where the gathering
is to be held, not the laird.

18:35.993 --> 18:40.456
Castle MacDonald
would be available.

18:40.540 --> 18:45.253
Tell me, who's the young
blonde lady over there?
I don't recognise her.

18:45.336 --> 18:49.674
-Um, that's
Paul's girlfriend...
-Amanda MacLeish.

18:49.757 --> 18:52.552
-She runs
the Lagganmore Distillery now.
-(LEXIE COUGHS)

18:53.845 --> 18:55.263
How interesting.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.976
DUNCAN: Yes! Oh... Sorry.

19:00.059 --> 19:02.687
Oh, don't worry, Duncan.
It happens sometimes.

19:02.770 --> 19:04.522
Leave it.
I'll call a plumber tomorrow.

19:04.605 --> 19:07.150
Oh, no. I'm not going to
let this thing beat me.

19:07.233 --> 19:10.361
Duncan, you've spent
nearly two hours
on it already. Come on.

19:10.445 --> 19:13.614
I'm nearly there!
Where's the picture
of the hose thing, again?

19:15.241 --> 19:17.035
Maybe it's supposed to be
the other way up.

19:18.911 --> 19:19.912
Oh, I see what you mean.

19:21.456 --> 19:23.958
Right, I'm gonna get
this thing cracked,

19:24.042 --> 19:26.169
even if it takes all night.

19:28.004 --> 19:30.048
I'll go and read my book.

19:33.593 --> 19:36.804
There are ten MacDonalds
coming from California.

19:43.603 --> 19:45.355
Oh, ah...

19:45.438 --> 19:49.067
Have you interviewed
all sorts of famous people?

19:49.150 --> 19:52.820
Dolly the sheep,
her last interview.

19:52.904 --> 19:54.489
Have you finished with that?

19:55.865 --> 19:58.076
So, are you enjoying the meal?

19:58.159 --> 20:00.828
Personally, I'm not a great
fan of farm salmon,

20:00.912 --> 20:04.540
but that's by the by.

20:04.624 --> 20:08.544
Why are we
sitting down to eat with
a member of Clan MacLeish?

20:11.089 --> 20:13.675
Amanda is a friend of ours.

20:13.758 --> 20:17.512
And an enemy of your family.
I did explain about
your responsibility.

20:17.595 --> 20:20.598
Yes, yes you did,
but she was already invited.

20:20.682 --> 20:25.603
Excuse me, if there's
a problem, can we sort it out
between ourselves?

20:25.687 --> 20:29.065
The MacDonalds and
the MacLeishes have
been sworn enemies

20:29.148 --> 20:30.900
for over 400 years.

20:30.983 --> 20:34.445
Charles, this is neither
the time nor the place
for a history lesson.

20:34.529 --> 20:35.905
Oh, I couldn't agree less.

20:35.988 --> 20:38.825
Well, all I know is that back
in the Middle Ages,

20:38.908 --> 20:42.120
the MacLeishes used to
rape your women
and steal your sheep.

20:42.203 --> 20:44.247
Maybe it was
the other way round...

20:44.330 --> 20:46.499
And the MacDonalds gave
as good as they got,

20:46.582 --> 20:49.961
but we hung up our claymores
a long time ago.

20:50.044 --> 20:52.797
Well, that's the MacLeish
point of view.

20:52.880 --> 20:56.426
Look, can we drop this?
You are a guest in our house.

20:56.509 --> 21:00.513
And you, Mr Bowman,
are a guest of
the MacDonald clan gathering.

21:02.348 --> 21:06.853
In my personal opinion,
it's never wise
to trust a MacLeish.

21:06.936 --> 21:10.189
They're all liars, cowards
and cheats, to a man...
or a woman.

21:10.273 --> 21:13.693
My father told me about this.
He said it was all
a lot of nonsense.

21:14.610 --> 21:17.321
Then your father is a fool.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.873
Will you excuse me, please,
Lexie? I've got
a bit of a headache.

21:35.548 --> 21:37.925
Amanda has just
lost her father.

21:43.056 --> 21:44.182
Okay.

21:46.059 --> 21:47.977
We have lift-off.

21:48.061 --> 21:50.396
Let's see what
this baby can do.

21:53.816 --> 21:55.568
Houston...

21:55.651 --> 21:57.362
We have a problem.

22:05.119 --> 22:06.245
Jess?

22:10.667 --> 22:11.793
Jess?

22:14.337 --> 22:15.588
Jess?

22:18.424 --> 22:20.134
What about dinner?

22:24.180 --> 22:25.390
JESS: Morning.

22:28.601 --> 22:30.103
DUNCAN: What time is it?

22:30.186 --> 22:32.063
Twenty to nine. Forgot to
set the alarm last night.

22:32.146 --> 22:33.481
I should be at work.

22:33.564 --> 22:36.818
No, it's all right.
Who's gonna know? Budge up.

22:36.901 --> 22:38.027
Who's that?

22:39.028 --> 22:42.407
Oh! Oh. Oh, sorry, sorry.

22:42.490 --> 22:47.036
Uh, I was looking for Golly.
One of the guests
wants to go fishing.

22:47.120 --> 22:51.082
Uhh, there was
something about a stag being
hit by a car.

22:51.165 --> 22:52.583
I think he went to
track it down.

22:52.667 --> 22:55.420
Oh, well, if you see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

22:56.629 --> 22:57.672
Oh, no!

22:57.755 --> 22:59.298
What?

22:59.382 --> 23:01.259
She'll tell him as soon
as she sees him.

23:01.342 --> 23:02.802
That we were drinking tea?

23:02.885 --> 23:05.638
It doesn't look like that.
He'll go ballistic.

23:05.722 --> 23:09.976
-That's his problem.
No, believe me, a ballistic
Golly's everybody's problem.

23:10.059 --> 23:12.770
See, the thing is,
Golly trusts me,

23:12.854 --> 23:15.773
and if he thinks for a minute
that I was running around
behind his back then...

23:15.857 --> 23:18.651
Duncan, we haven't done
anything behind his back.

23:18.735 --> 23:20.361
Yeah, I know...

23:20.737 --> 23:21.821
Yet.

23:23.573 --> 23:25.908
Do either of you need
a lift up to the house?

23:31.247 --> 23:32.832
Looking for something?

23:32.915 --> 23:34.542
Marmalade.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.461
It usually comes in a jar.

23:36.544 --> 23:39.005
I prefer the coarse variety.

23:39.088 --> 23:41.007
Well, you won't find
any in there.

23:42.383 --> 23:44.052
Or were you really
after the whisky?

23:44.135 --> 23:46.220
(SCOFFS)
I beg your pardon?

23:46.304 --> 23:49.515
Hands off, pal.
This is reserved for
the function tomorrow.

23:49.599 --> 23:52.352
Function?
You mean the banquet?

23:52.435 --> 23:56.898
No, I mean for Amanda
and her guests up
by the loch.

23:56.981 --> 23:58.691
So it looks like you won't
be getting any.

23:58.775 --> 24:00.610
I don't much care
for your tone.

24:00.693 --> 24:03.071
And I don't like people
stealing booze from
my kitchen.

24:03.154 --> 24:05.823
Are you calling me a thief?

24:05.907 --> 24:08.159
Away and raffle
your doughnut, pal!

24:11.746 --> 24:13.247
Duncan?

24:13.331 --> 24:14.916
Are you sure you don't mind
storing the whisky here?

24:14.999 --> 24:16.167
Of course not.

24:16.250 --> 24:17.835
I'm supposed to be meeting
my aunt at the station

24:17.919 --> 24:20.421
and I have to get to
the florist before it closes.

24:21.589 --> 24:22.840
Hold on.

24:26.344 --> 24:28.638
I put the ashes
from the urn in here.

24:28.721 --> 24:32.600
I couldn't stand that
plastic thing they gave us
at the undertaker's.

24:32.684 --> 24:35.269
I suppose it's
kind of appropriate.

24:35.353 --> 24:36.979
The distillery was
his whole life.

24:38.272 --> 24:39.607
And now...

24:41.609 --> 24:44.320
You go. I can sort
everything out up here.

24:44.404 --> 24:46.698
Now you've got
enough to think about.

24:46.781 --> 24:48.866
And I'll even provide
some food for your guests.

24:49.909 --> 24:51.369
I can't ask you to do that.

24:51.452 --> 24:53.329
It's no problem,
leave it to me.

24:53.413 --> 24:54.831
Do you need a trolley?

24:54.914 --> 24:57.417
I can manage, I'm not a wuss.

24:59.252 --> 25:01.754
Can I ask you
to take the ashes as well?

25:01.838 --> 25:03.589
It'll be one less thing
to worry about.

25:03.673 --> 25:05.008
Yeah, of course.

25:05.091 --> 25:06.300
Thanks, Paul.

25:09.178 --> 25:10.346
Molly.

25:12.932 --> 25:15.143
(SIGHING)
I just don't know what to say.

25:15.226 --> 25:18.104
No need. Done a good job
though, haven't they?

25:18.187 --> 25:19.731
It's beautiful!

25:19.814 --> 25:23.651
But I never imagined
you'd go all the way
to London.

25:23.735 --> 25:27.280
Oh, thank you so much!

25:27.363 --> 25:29.782
So, you weren't tempted
by the bright lights, then?

25:29.866 --> 25:32.076
All those exciting things
to see and do?

25:32.160 --> 25:35.288
No, no, Molly,
everything I want
is right here.

25:38.166 --> 25:39.959
MIKE: Where's the sound?

25:40.877 --> 25:42.795
BRIAN: They're off-mike.

25:42.879 --> 25:47.008
No. No, there's nothing there.
I don't believe it!
The first decent footage!

25:47.091 --> 25:49.719
It's not all bad, that guy
has asked me to film
his daughter's wedding.

25:49.802 --> 25:52.180
Oh, excellent!

25:52.263 --> 25:55.558
-How's it going?
-Oh, every frame's a
Rembrandt.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.477
Ah! No, no, no, no,
that argument from
last night,

25:57.560 --> 25:58.811
I do not want that in it.

25:58.895 --> 26:02.690
You have my word
as a producer.

26:02.774 --> 26:06.194
Look, what we need
is some kind of
introductory interview.

26:06.277 --> 26:11.366
You know this kind of thing,
"Lexie MacDonald, first female
Laird of Glenbogle."

26:11.449 --> 26:14.160
You know, if you
say it often enough,
I might start believing it.

26:15.828 --> 26:18.998
-Ah.
-Ah! Good morning Charles.
How are we today?

26:19.082 --> 26:23.002
Displeased. Your chef
has been insufferably rude.

26:24.128 --> 26:25.171
Good for him.

26:25.254 --> 26:26.339
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

26:27.382 --> 26:29.008
I want something done.

26:29.092 --> 26:32.345
Okay, okay, leave it to me.

26:35.682 --> 26:39.102
Look, um...

26:39.185 --> 26:43.439
I was very interested in what
you were saying last night
about the clan history.

26:43.523 --> 26:46.526
Fascinating, all that stuff
about the feud,

26:46.609 --> 26:50.780
and right now, history is
the new rock and roll.

26:50.863 --> 26:54.951
You make a good history doc,
it gets shown all round
the world.

26:55.034 --> 26:56.536
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

26:58.663 --> 27:01.457
Maybe we should talk.

27:01.541 --> 27:04.293
I cannot believe
you said that to him!

27:04.377 --> 27:07.755
Ewan, you cannot go round
just insulting our guests!

27:07.839 --> 27:11.009
No, because all we're
interested in is being
Queen of Glenbogle

27:11.092 --> 27:13.344
and passing
yourself off one of the toffs.

27:13.428 --> 27:16.556
I am not passing myself off
as anything.

27:16.639 --> 27:18.599
I grew up two miles
away from you!

27:18.683 --> 27:20.727
Then why do you
pretend you're somebody else?

27:23.021 --> 27:28.735
So, we open with marching
feet, burning haystacks,

27:28.818 --> 27:32.113
naked women running
out of their crofts,

27:32.196 --> 27:35.158
and then,
the Mel Gibson voiceover...

27:35.241 --> 27:39.120
I was thinking more compare
and contrast, you know.

27:39.203 --> 27:42.999
Castle MacDonald
with this pale imitation
of a clan gathering.

27:43.082 --> 27:45.752
Well, you're
the boss, Charlie.

27:45.835 --> 27:47.170
It's Charles.

27:47.253 --> 27:49.505
I don't know about you,
but I could do with a drink.

27:49.589 --> 27:52.425
If there's one thing
more annoying than
your constant need

27:52.508 --> 27:57.096
for refreshment,
it's your urge to tell
everyone about it.

27:58.931 --> 28:00.433
What the hell?

28:08.775 --> 28:10.109
Over here.

28:15.156 --> 28:16.532
Are you okay?

28:20.828 --> 28:22.914
What are you doing out here?

28:22.997 --> 28:24.916
I thought I'd
keep out of the way.

28:24.999 --> 28:27.627
I'd hate to put Charlie boy
off his cucumber sandwiches.

28:29.128 --> 28:30.588
He getting to you, is he?

28:31.547 --> 28:33.257
Him I can handle.

28:33.341 --> 28:37.387
But Lexie? I thought
your boss was supposed
to stick up for you.

28:38.763 --> 28:40.556
She's under a lot
of pressure right now.

28:41.516 --> 28:44.185
It's not my fault.

28:44.268 --> 28:48.147
At least I've got
a day off tomorrow.
See how the caterers like it.

28:48.231 --> 28:50.400
But you'd rather be the one
doing the cooking, eh?

28:52.985 --> 28:55.071
Well, I'll tell you what,

28:55.154 --> 28:57.657
why don't you do the food
for Amanda's thing
down by the loch?

28:57.740 --> 28:58.866
Yeah?

28:59.659 --> 29:00.785
Yeah.

29:01.911 --> 29:03.037
Here.

29:04.330 --> 29:06.165
(CAR ALARM SOUNDING)

29:13.506 --> 29:15.091

29:22.265 --> 29:24.809
JESS: Duncan?
Are you in there?

29:41.784 --> 29:43.995
Duncan, you are filthy.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.166
Washing machine.

29:58.718 --> 30:01.346
(BANGING GLASS ON TABLE)

30:01.429 --> 30:06.225
(CLEARING THROAT)
Ladies and gentlemen.
Fellow MacDonalds.

30:06.309 --> 30:10.396
Before we embark on another
no doubt excellent dinner,

30:10.480 --> 30:13.232
I'd like to perform
a small ceremony.

30:13.316 --> 30:16.235
Would Lexie MacDonald
step forward, please?

30:16.319 --> 30:18.404
I wasn't expecting this.

30:18.488 --> 30:20.573
CHARLES: When I was
researching clan history,

30:20.656 --> 30:26.788
I discovered an historic oath
of allegiance, taken by
the first Laird of Glenbogle,

30:26.871 --> 30:31.542
and it occurred to me,
it might be fitting
to ask the first female laird

30:31.626 --> 30:33.002
to take the same oath.

30:33.086 --> 30:34.879
Hear! Hear!

30:34.962 --> 30:38.299
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't think it's
quite my style.

30:38.383 --> 30:44.806
Ah, but remember,
it's the clan that decides,
not the laird.

30:44.889 --> 30:48.851
And I'm sure we'd all like
to hear you take the oath.

30:48.935 --> 30:50.978
Hear! Hear!

30:51.062 --> 30:54.357
-Told you this was getting
out of hand.
-Thank you.

30:56.359 --> 31:01.030
Charles.
Oh! I see the first laird
also had a word processor!

31:01.114 --> 31:04.200
It's my own translation,
from the old Scots.

31:05.243 --> 31:06.285
(LEXIE CLEARING THROAT)
Okay.

31:07.912 --> 31:12.291
"I, Lexie MacDonald,
do swear to uphold and fight

31:12.375 --> 31:16.504
"for the customs
and traditions of my clan,

31:16.587 --> 31:22.969
"give no succour
to our enemies and honour
the will of my clansmen.

31:23.052 --> 31:28.516
"I shall do this
for as long as I do remain
Laird of Glenbogle."

31:28.599 --> 31:29.934
Well done.

31:32.061 --> 31:33.396
We'll make a laird of you yet.

31:41.612 --> 31:43.614
Duncan? Where are you?

31:44.157 --> 31:45.992
Here.

31:46.075 --> 31:48.786
Come on, I promise
I won't laugh.

31:53.291 --> 31:54.959
You look cute.

31:57.420 --> 31:58.880
You promised.

31:58.963 --> 32:01.049
Pink is so
your colour.

32:01.132 --> 32:02.759
Right, that's it!

(TRUCK DOOR CLOSING)

32:22.487 --> 32:24.238
Dad, hi.
You can't come in.

32:24.322 --> 32:26.741
-What you talking about?
-There's something
I need to tell you.

32:26.824 --> 32:31.454
-Is somebody in there?
-No one. Hey, listen, Amanda
gave me a bottle...

32:31.537 --> 32:32.914
What's that noise?

32:32.997 --> 32:37.168
Aye, well, that's what
I wanted to tell you.

32:37.251 --> 32:40.630
Erm, I bought
a washing machine.

32:42.590 --> 32:44.092
Ah!

33:07.240 --> 33:08.491
Evening.

33:11.202 --> 33:13.746
Just thought
I'd get an early night.

33:50.324 --> 33:51.576
There we go.

33:51.659 --> 33:53.119
Perfect.

33:53.202 --> 33:55.538
I think we should
have a toast, Molly.

33:55.621 --> 33:57.874
Mm-hmm, what
shall we drink to?

33:57.957 --> 33:59.500
Old friends.

34:00.168 --> 34:01.377
Fresh starts.

34:01.461 --> 34:03.463
Is the sun over
the yardarm already?

34:05.298 --> 34:07.884
I wouldn't mind
vox-popping that!

34:09.010 --> 34:11.512
"That" is my daughter.

34:11.596 --> 34:15.850
Okay...
Brian, could we set up for
the interview, please?

34:20.438 --> 34:22.607
Paul, where are you
going to be today?

34:22.690 --> 34:25.443
With Amanda. Look, there's
no need for you to worry,
It's all under control.

34:25.525 --> 34:28.154
Yeah, well as long as
Charles MacDonald doesn't
find out what's going on.

34:28.237 --> 34:30.239
Anyone seen Duncan?

34:30.322 --> 34:32.909
Yeah, he's at the main gate,
stopping cars
and checking invitations.

34:32.992 --> 34:34.659
Okay. Thanks.

34:34.744 --> 34:36.996
Actually, Jess, I need to...

34:39.415 --> 34:41.042
All under control, then, eh?

34:41.125 --> 34:43.585
And Duncan on traffic duty?
You sure about that?

34:43.670 --> 34:45.254
As long as he sends
the MacDonalds to the house,

34:45.338 --> 34:47.215
and MacLeishes to the beach,
it shouldn't be a problem.

34:48.382 --> 34:49.676
He'll be fine.

34:49.759 --> 34:51.719
And Ewan's coming down later
with the food.

34:51.803 --> 34:54.138
-Ewan?
-I asked him to help.

34:54.222 --> 34:55.514
Apparently,

34:55.598 --> 34:57.350
you've been giving him
a bit of hard time recently.

34:57.433 --> 35:00.019
Yeah, okay, okay, but he
hasn't been much help, though.

35:00.895 --> 35:02.355
We're all behind you, Lex.

35:02.438 --> 35:03.856
Including Ewan.

35:03.940 --> 35:06.526
He wants this weekend to be
a success as much as you do.

35:06.609 --> 35:08.403
Don't forget that, eh?

35:36.472 --> 35:40.059
Hello. The beach is just
round the corner...

36:09.797 --> 36:12.675
Ah! Here she is!

36:12.758 --> 36:15.261
The fragrant goddess
of the glen!

36:15.345 --> 36:17.347
-What do you want?
-A few pearls of wisdom

36:17.430 --> 36:20.433
that we can immortalise
on celluloid.

36:20.516 --> 36:22.684
An audience with
Lexie MacDonald.

36:22.768 --> 36:24.479
He means an interview.

36:24.562 --> 36:27.106
Oh right.
Well, it'll have to wait.

36:27.190 --> 36:29.942
Somebody else needs to find
a few home truths first.

36:51.005 --> 36:52.799
Great!

36:52.882 --> 36:54.801
So the caterers
have left because
the range isn't working.

36:54.884 --> 36:56.177
What's wrong with it?

36:56.260 --> 36:57.637
Just isn't working.

36:57.720 --> 36:58.888
Have you checked the fuel?

36:58.971 --> 36:59.972
Yeah.

37:01.599 --> 37:02.642
Did you order it?

37:02.725 --> 37:04.602
-You didn't tell me.
-I did!

37:04.686 --> 37:06.312
You just didn't listen.

37:06.396 --> 37:07.605
I'm sorry.

37:07.689 --> 37:09.857
(SIGHING)
Well it's too late
for that now.

37:09.941 --> 37:12.151
Just have to
find the barbecue.

37:12.235 --> 37:13.653
You want me to call
the caterers back?

37:13.736 --> 37:14.821
No.

37:14.904 --> 37:16.030
'Cause now you get your wish.

37:16.114 --> 37:17.448
You're going to do it.

37:17.532 --> 37:19.492
But I'm supposed to be helping
Paul down by the loch.

37:19.575 --> 37:21.744
Not until you've sorted
something out here first.

37:29.752 --> 37:31.170
Oh, hi.
Have you got my clothes?

37:31.254 --> 37:32.714
No. Come here.

37:53.693 --> 37:56.320
We could start early,
I make it
we're nearly all here.

37:56.404 --> 37:58.239
Well, there's no rush,
is there?

37:58.322 --> 38:01.617
I mean, perhaps
people would like
a bit of a walk first.

38:01.701 --> 38:02.827
Is there a problem?

38:02.910 --> 38:04.203
No, no, of course not.

38:04.287 --> 38:06.998
-What about the ashes?
-They are over at the house.

38:07.081 --> 38:08.666
I didn't want to take
any chances.

38:08.750 --> 38:11.544
They're hardly likely
to be stolen.

38:11.627 --> 38:13.588
No, but best be
on the safe side.

38:13.671 --> 38:15.089
I, uh...

38:15.173 --> 38:17.300
I'd better see how Ewan's
getting on then.

38:17.383 --> 38:19.135
I'll be straight back.

38:19.218 --> 38:22.263
-Calm down. You're more
nervous than I am.

38:33.191 --> 38:35.360
Sorry about that.
If you go further up,

38:35.443 --> 38:37.195
you'll find your party
on the right.

(HORNS BLARING)

38:55.630 --> 38:57.423
You lied to me!

-Dad.
-You!

39:00.927 --> 39:02.762
You get back to work!

39:11.187 --> 39:12.897
Are you going to tell me
what the questions are?

39:12.980 --> 39:15.775
No, I like spontaneous.
Let's just go for it.

39:15.858 --> 39:16.859
Turn over.

39:18.111 --> 39:20.279
Lexie, you've been called

39:20.363 --> 39:22.824
"the Queen of Glenbogle."
How does...

39:22.907 --> 39:24.659
EWAN: I can't find it, Lexie.

39:24.742 --> 39:28.287
Cut. Can you tell him
to be quiet?

39:28.371 --> 39:31.124
Ewan, will you keep the noise
down in there, please?

39:31.207 --> 39:33.876
Maybe we should give it
five minutes. A wee...

39:33.960 --> 39:36.462
No, I'd like to go again.

39:36.546 --> 39:38.297
Turn over.

39:38.381 --> 39:40.133
(CLEARING THROAT) Lexie.

39:40.216 --> 39:42.510
-(CRASHING AND SHOUTING)
-Cut.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.013
LEXIE: Excuse me a minute.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.520
Duncan, this is an emergency.
Yesterday when you were
moving bottles,

39:52.603 --> 39:55.523
did you come across
a Lagganmore whisky sleeve
with dust inside?

39:55.606 --> 39:56.941
I didn't look.

39:57.025 --> 40:00.194
I've got to find it and quick,
or I'm in big trouble.

40:00.278 --> 40:03.281
Hurry up. We need something
to put all this
old charcoal into.

40:04.032 --> 40:06.242
Leave it to me.

40:06.325 --> 40:09.912
Now, when you're...
When you're finished that,

40:09.996 --> 40:12.415
-just get this all fired up.
-Mrs MacDonald.

40:12.498 --> 40:15.126
-Yes?
-We're ready for your
interview now.

40:16.169 --> 40:17.795
Lex, can I have a word?

40:17.879 --> 40:20.131
Sorry. Will you just give me
a minute.

40:21.215 --> 40:22.383
Brian!

40:45.073 --> 40:46.783
If they were here, we would
have found them by now.

40:46.866 --> 40:48.534
They've gotta be here
somewhere. They've gotta be.

40:48.618 --> 40:50.036
Um,

40:50.119 --> 40:51.746
there is this...

40:56.125 --> 40:59.420
JESS: Are you sure about this?
DUNCAN: It'll work. Trust me.
Come on.

41:04.842 --> 41:07.512
Sorry about that.
It's been a very busy day.

41:07.595 --> 41:09.347
I've got a spare
ten minutes now.

41:09.430 --> 41:11.099
Let's get on with it, then.

41:11.182 --> 41:14.143
Brian, can you
turn over, please.

41:14.227 --> 41:18.439
Lexie, you've been called
"the Queen of Glenbogle."

41:18.523 --> 41:22.110
How does your approach differ
from those of previous lairds?

41:22.193 --> 41:24.529
Um, well, I believe
if it ain't broken...

41:24.612 --> 41:26.072
Cut! We have to cut.

41:26.155 --> 41:27.949
-What?
-Charles asked us to let
him know

41:28.032 --> 41:29.826
-when we're doing
the interview.
-Charles?

41:29.909 --> 41:33.454
Ah, the heady scent
of show biz.

41:33.538 --> 41:38.084
Even grown men can't resist
a wee sprinkling of stardust.

41:38.167 --> 41:40.753
Let's go and look for him,
shall we?

41:42.547 --> 41:43.840
Amanda!

41:51.639 --> 41:53.766
-Here they are.
-Found them.

41:57.520 --> 42:03.526
Now, the MacDonalds are famous
for fast food and old feuds.

42:03.609 --> 42:09.240
Can you tell me about the
bad feeling between your
family and the MacLeishes?

42:09.323 --> 42:11.617
Hold on.
Can we stop that there?

42:11.701 --> 42:14.537
I don't know much about
the family history.
I told you that.

42:14.620 --> 42:15.913
Keep rolling.

42:15.997 --> 42:18.541
You don't know much about
the family history?

42:18.624 --> 42:21.669
Um, no, but, I will learn.

42:21.753 --> 42:23.087
Moving on.

42:29.218 --> 42:31.429
-Amanda...
-Don't touch me!

42:31.512 --> 42:33.097
Were you trying to
humiliate me?

42:33.181 --> 42:34.599
No.

42:34.682 --> 42:38.144
No, I'm really sorry.
I was desperate.

42:38.227 --> 42:41.189
Someone must have taken
the ashes. I don't know
how it happened.

42:41.272 --> 42:44.817
That is the most feeble
excuse I've ever heard.
It's not even an excuse!

42:44.901 --> 42:46.778
I know.

42:46.861 --> 42:48.988
I wanted more than anything
for today to go right for you.

42:49.822 --> 42:52.158
Well, it hasn't.

42:52.241 --> 42:55.661
The one thing I wanted to do
for my dad and

42:55.745 --> 42:58.247
it turns into a complete
disaster.

42:59.415 --> 43:00.541
(SOBBING)

43:04.045 --> 43:06.089
I promised myself
I wasn't going to do this.

43:08.299 --> 43:09.759
I'm so sorry.

43:21.688 --> 43:26.859
This is where the MacDonald
clan has gathered to celebrate
its history and tradition,

43:26.943 --> 43:31.781
but could you tell me
what is happening at
the other end of the loch?

43:31.864 --> 43:34.450
Look, that's it. It's over.
Cut the camera.

43:34.534 --> 43:36.577
You've allowed members of
the MacLeish family

43:36.661 --> 43:39.455
to carry out
a ceremony of their own,

43:39.539 --> 43:43.543
flouting the traditions
that only last night
you swore to uphold.

43:43.626 --> 43:45.795
We await an explanation.

43:45.878 --> 43:47.922
Why are you doing this?
We had a deal.

43:48.006 --> 43:51.592
Oh, I suggested
that the treachery of
the Queen of Glenbogle

43:51.676 --> 44:00.184
might make a better story.
So, I hired Michael here.
And he who pays the piper...

44:00.268 --> 44:05.523
Shall we adjourn to the beach,
and see if we have indeed
been invaded by clan MacLeish?

44:07.400 --> 44:11.404
Um... No, I...

44:11.487 --> 44:16.117
If you did want to try,
and outbid Charlie boy,
I'm open to offers.

44:16.951 --> 44:18.202
Perhaps, not.

44:20.621 --> 44:22.999
-What on Earth is happening?
-It's a nightmare!

44:25.460 --> 44:27.003
What do I tell them?

44:30.048 --> 44:31.257
Leave it to me.

44:38.097 --> 44:39.557
Ladies and gentlemen,

44:40.808 --> 44:42.560
I have an apology to make.

44:51.486 --> 44:52.612
What now?

45:02.080 --> 45:04.665
I think, this might be
what you're looking for.

45:06.125 --> 45:07.877
This is outrageous!

45:07.960 --> 45:11.047
It is indeed.
You've no right to be here.

45:11.130 --> 45:12.632
What are you talking about?

45:12.715 --> 45:16.260
Scattering your father's ashes
on MacDonald land.

45:16.344 --> 45:17.553
How dare you?

45:17.637 --> 45:19.055
She's got every right
to be here.

45:20.682 --> 45:22.433
Your presence here
on this beach,

45:22.517 --> 45:25.269
sneaking in behind their backs
is an insult
to the MacDonalds.

45:25.353 --> 45:27.397
Stop it! All of you!

45:29.607 --> 45:33.403
And while I'm laird, I'll say
what goes on in this estate,
not you.

45:33.486 --> 45:37.198
Oh! We have
taped evidence that you've
betrayed your oath.

45:37.281 --> 45:40.993
And I put it to you,
that you're no longer fit
to host this clan gathering,

45:41.077 --> 45:43.538
and then in future,
they should be held
at Castle MacDonald.

45:43.621 --> 45:44.956
We can take a vote now.

45:45.957 --> 45:47.583
Right.
Okay, okay, well...

45:48.668 --> 45:50.461
We can let the clan
decide, but...

45:51.838 --> 45:54.424
Can I say something first?

45:54.507 --> 45:58.928
Now, we're all gathered here
to celebrate the traditions
of the MacDonald clan.

46:01.472 --> 46:06.561
I arrived here a kid,
with no home, no job,

46:06.644 --> 46:10.189
and this family took me in.

46:10.273 --> 46:12.984
So, to me, the MacDonald
traditions that
matter the most

46:13.067 --> 46:17.113
are generosity
and hospitality.

46:17.196 --> 46:21.159
But, there are some
traditions that we're far
better off without,

46:21.242 --> 46:25.121
and one of them is this
stupid quarrel with
the MacLeish family.

46:25.872 --> 46:27.540
I want to end it today.

46:27.623 --> 46:30.460
-This is all beside the point.
-No, it's not!

46:30.543 --> 46:32.795
Amanda is our friend.

46:32.879 --> 46:35.548
And if we can't end this fight
with her family, then...

46:37.175 --> 46:40.928
Then I don't want to host
any more clan gatherings.

46:41.012 --> 46:42.680
You're welcome
to them, Charles.

46:45.058 --> 46:51.647
So, who wants
to put an end
to a feud, that is so old

46:51.731 --> 46:54.400
that no one
can even remember
what it was about?

47:02.200 --> 47:05.578
This is the MacDonald quaich.

47:05.661 --> 47:08.748
One of the family's
oldest heirlooms,

47:08.831 --> 47:13.211
and something that the clan
have valued for generations.

47:13.294 --> 47:19.175
It's been used
to end disputes,
seal friendships.

47:19.258 --> 47:22.261
Doesn't that tell you
what the MacDonalds
value most?

47:22.345 --> 47:26.683
Not wars and feuds,
but a good party!

47:26.766 --> 47:28.643
(ALL CHUCKLING)

47:30.228 --> 47:31.479
Golly?

47:41.155 --> 47:44.617
MacLeish whisky
in a MacDonald cup.

47:49.872 --> 47:51.916
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

47:52.917 --> 47:54.794
To the clan MacLeish.

48:01.676 --> 48:03.928
ALL: The clan MacLeish.
(APPLAUSE)

48:09.350 --> 48:11.811
Now, who'll take
a drink with me?

48:19.694 --> 48:21.988
My father loved this place.

48:22.071 --> 48:26.617
And...he thought
of the MacDonalds
as his friends.

48:26.701 --> 48:29.120
So, nothing would
please him more.

48:32.415 --> 48:34.250
The MacDonalds.

48:34.334 --> 48:35.793
ALL: The MacDonalds.

48:43.968 --> 48:45.219
Charles?

49:02.236 --> 49:03.905
Clan MacLeish.

49:03.988 --> 49:05.865
(APPLAUSE)

49:24.217 --> 49:26.052
(BAGPIPE PLAYING)

50:18.521 --> 50:20.231
EWAN: Excuse me.
Coming through.

50:20.982 --> 50:23.276
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

50:23.359 --> 50:26.654
(BRIAN GRUNTING)
Do it yourself, Mike.

50:26.738 --> 50:28.573
MIKE: Hey, Brian,
we're a team!
BRIAN: Oh, yeah?

50:28.656 --> 50:32.243
MIKE: I'll make it 50-50!
BRIAN: Big deal!

50:32.326 --> 50:34.704
Lexie, you have done us proud!

50:34.787 --> 50:39.125
-Have I?
-Yes! Look at everybody
having such fun.

50:39.208 --> 50:41.544
You certainly put
Charles in his place!

50:41.627 --> 50:44.047
Yeah, but in the process,
I managed to

50:44.130 --> 50:47.050
hurt all the people
that really matter.

50:47.133 --> 50:51.971
Charles was right, Molly.
I'm no laird. I never will be.

50:56.934 --> 51:00.938
You wouldn't believe they
were sworn enemies a couple
of hours ago, would you?

51:01.022 --> 51:04.901
In the spirit of
MacLeish and MacDonald
rapprochement, dance?

51:05.485 --> 51:06.694
Okay.

51:16.287 --> 51:19.123
MOLLY: Don't be too hard
on them, Golly.

51:19.207 --> 51:20.792
GOLLY: This is a mistake.

51:20.875 --> 51:24.879
Maybe, but even if it is,
it's their mistake.

51:24.962 --> 51:29.967
Sometimes we have to
get out of our old ways
of thinking about things.

51:30.051 --> 51:34.055
All sorts of things that would
never have been possible
in the past can happen now.

51:38.643 --> 51:39.644
Hi.

51:55.702 --> 51:57.161
(SLOW WALTZ PLAYING)

52:14.637 --> 52:19.142
Lex, Lex,
you were fantastic!

52:19.225 --> 52:24.063
I haven't heard
a speech like that
since...the Oscars!

52:24.147 --> 52:26.983
And, halfway through,
it hit me. I don't know
where it comes from.

52:27.066 --> 52:29.235
It's a gift, I guess.

52:29.318 --> 52:35.867
Anyway, what we should do
is a great big, in-your-face,
feel-good movie about you!

52:35.950 --> 52:40.163
The Glasgow girl
that became
a fairytale princess.

52:40.246 --> 52:43.166
You know,
you can take the girl
out of Glasgow...

52:44.917 --> 52:47.587
Away and raffle
your doughnut, pal!
