01:09.599 --> 01:13.066
What if I told you
that three months ago I died?

01:14.232 --> 01:16.166
Let's start from the beginning.

01:24.533 --> 01:27.433
This city is a ghost of its former self.

01:31.799 --> 01:35.399
Overrun by crime and poverty.

01:36.399 --> 01:37.899
Ruled by an organization

01:37.965 --> 01:40.466
that uses pain and fear to control.

01:41.999 --> 01:46.199
I made a stand against
them, and it cost me my life.

01:47.433 --> 01:50.899
But there was something waiting
for me on the other side.

01:51.799 --> 01:53.999
And in that moment, I knew...

01:54.999 --> 01:59.266
that this world would never be the same.

01:59.899 --> 02:01.399
Plan on giving me a hand?

02:02.633 --> 02:05.132
This why we don't take
calls in this part of town.

02:05.199 --> 02:07.032
We out here for five
seconds and everybody...

02:07.099 --> 02:08.932
we already popular, everybody looking.

02:08.999 --> 02:11.700
I thought you Latinos were hard

02:11.765 --> 02:13.099
and fiery and all that.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.865
Yeah, we hard and fiery in the bedroom,

02:14.932 --> 02:17.266
not in a crack alley full of banditos.

02:17.332 --> 02:18.999
Cut the shit and back me up, okay?

02:19.066 --> 02:21.466
- I got you, boss. Take it easy.
- Grab my kit.

02:21.533 --> 02:23.132
Okay.

02:33.266 --> 02:35.433
He's barely breathing.
We got to move him now.

02:35.499 --> 02:37.266
Okay, I got to get a gurney.

02:37.332 --> 02:39.433
- You got it?
- I got it, I got it.

02:42.599 --> 02:44.299
Damn.

02:44.366 --> 02:46.366
You fine as hell.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.999
In shape too.

02:50.699 --> 02:52.399
Hey, whoo-hoo! Earth to Nina.

02:52.466 --> 02:55.366
You want some private time or
you want to get him out of here?

02:55.433 --> 02:58.066
Come on.

03:04.332 --> 03:05.832
He's lost a lot of blood.

03:05.899 --> 03:08.232
I'm going to start a morphine IV drip.

03:09.199 --> 03:11.366
Yeah, how are we doing back there, eh?

03:22.066 --> 03:23.899
Damn it.

03:35.366 --> 03:36.699
There's no rush.

03:36.765 --> 03:38.299
He's gone.

04:05.199 --> 04:06.732
Where am I?

04:09.066 --> 04:11.666
In the back of an ambulance.

04:11.732 --> 04:13.899
You were shot and, uh,

04:13.965 --> 04:17.232
we tried to save you, but you died.

04:26.732 --> 04:28.399
Thank you for your help.

04:55.466 --> 04:57.099
I am your salvation.

05:02.166 --> 05:05.499
Give me a reason to spare your life.

05:07.299 --> 05:10.799
I swear I didn't do this.
I swear I didn't do this.

05:12.066 --> 05:15.433
It was these fucking guys.
These fucking guys robbed me.

05:16.266 --> 05:17.932
Please, I tried to fight them.

05:17.999 --> 05:19.533
There was too many.

05:19.599 --> 05:21.232
I tried to fight.

05:23.765 --> 05:25.232
Please.

05:25.299 --> 05:28.132
I ran. I ran. What was I supposed to do?

05:28.199 --> 05:29.899
There were so many of them.

05:29.965 --> 05:31.666
They had fucking guns.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.765
What was I supposed to do?

05:34.599 --> 05:35.732
I...

05:35.799 --> 05:37.332
what?

05:38.366 --> 05:40.899
Test... I've been loyal to you.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.999
Test, I've been loyal to you.

05:44.499 --> 05:45.865
Please give me time.

05:45.932 --> 05:48.566
Please give me time, I'll make this right.

05:48.633 --> 05:50.666
I'll make this right.

05:50.732 --> 05:52.066
Please, please...

05:54.999 --> 05:58.232
You lost 50 pounds of pure Synth.

06:03.732 --> 06:05.299
That's got to be worth...

06:06.066 --> 06:07.599
a million dollars easy, right?

06:07.666 --> 06:09.765
I'll fix it.

06:10.433 --> 06:11.499
Just give me time.

06:11.566 --> 06:13.266
What now?

06:19.732 --> 06:21.466
You see...

06:21.533 --> 06:25.633
there's nothing that
you can do in this world

06:25.699 --> 06:27.066
to make this right.

06:27.132 --> 06:28.932
Test...

06:28.999 --> 06:33.332
But find comfort in this, my brother:

06:36.799 --> 06:38.732
that in your death...

06:42.633 --> 06:46.799
...you will serve as a
reminder to all the others

06:46.865 --> 06:51.399
that weakness is not tolerated.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.232
Please, Test...

06:58.599 --> 07:01.199
- You're very proud.
- Please, Test...

07:12.466 --> 07:14.266
Sir, it's done.

07:14.332 --> 07:17.332
He won't be causing you any more trouble.

07:17.399 --> 07:19.132
Where's his body?

07:19.199 --> 07:22.232
Dumped in the alley downtown.
Made it look like a mugging.

07:22.299 --> 07:25.199
- You sure he's dead?
- There's no mistake.

07:26.566 --> 07:28.266
Ray Lazarus is dead.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.399
Good.

07:30.466 --> 07:33.732
I've got some personal
matters to attend to.

07:35.466 --> 07:38.799
Take care of this one
and report back to Poet.

08:08.832 --> 08:11.199
Ember.

08:11.266 --> 08:13.166
Welcome to Paradise City.

08:13.232 --> 08:15.199
Is this not what I promised you or what?

08:15.266 --> 08:17.799
Do you know how much
valuable time I've wasted

08:17.865 --> 08:19.799
waiting for you in this shithole?

08:19.865 --> 08:22.266
No, you want to tell me about it?

08:22.332 --> 08:23.965
A hundred pounds of Synth,

08:24.032 --> 08:26.965
premium grade, just like I promised.

08:27.032 --> 08:28.865
That's good. You came through.

08:28.932 --> 08:30.499
I'm proud of you.

08:30.566 --> 08:31.899
Money first.

08:31.965 --> 08:34.899
Oh, what, you don't trust me? All right.

08:34.965 --> 08:37.932
Yo, G, show her the money, dawg.

08:43.066 --> 08:44.399
We cool?

08:46.199 --> 08:47.732
Yeah.

08:49.599 --> 08:50.832
Nice doing business with you.

08:50.899 --> 08:52.399
No, hold up.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.999
Business ain't done yet.

08:54.066 --> 08:55.366
So check this out.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.499
We gonna keep the Synth and the money.

08:57.566 --> 08:58.999
What you think about that?

08:59.066 --> 09:01.032
You know who you're stealing from?

09:01.099 --> 09:03.566
What he'll do to you and your boyfriends

09:03.633 --> 09:05.166
when he finds out?

09:05.232 --> 09:07.965
Yeah, well, we're stupid.
We don't give a fuck.

09:08.032 --> 09:10.700
Hey, dawg, do me a favor, man.

09:10.765 --> 09:13.466
Grab that shit and shut this bitch up.

09:18.232 --> 09:21.232
What the fuck you guys doing? Get her ass!

09:50.865 --> 09:52.932
This it?

09:53.700 --> 09:55.232
Yeah.

09:55.299 --> 09:56.666
This is it.

09:56.732 --> 10:01.832
Hey, if you don't mind me
asking, Sarge, why come back?

10:02.799 --> 10:04.032
Why now?

10:04.099 --> 10:05.799
Settle a debt.

10:05.865 --> 10:07.499
I know that look.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.865
But from the sounds of it,
you're going to need some help.

10:10.932 --> 10:12.965
Myself and some of the
boys from the old unit,

10:13.032 --> 10:14.366
we're still around.

10:14.433 --> 10:15.566
So you make that call,

10:15.633 --> 10:17.633
we got your back.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.566
Semper fi, do or die.

10:19.633 --> 10:21.199
Faithful to the corp.

10:21.266 --> 10:23.032
Watch your six.

10:24.899 --> 10:26.899
You bet your ass.

10:29.865 --> 10:31.832
Whoa!

10:35.266 --> 10:37.799
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Oh, no, no, no.

10:37.865 --> 10:39.299
We can't do that.

10:39.366 --> 10:41.599
Listen, I just got done
doing a six-year bit,

10:41.666 --> 10:45.932
and I ain't seen nothing as
pretty as you in a long time.

10:46.732 --> 10:48.433
I promise I'll be gentle.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.399
Hey!

10:53.232 --> 10:56.732
I'm sure whatever you're looking for...

10:57.533 --> 10:59.266
you can find somewhere else.

11:01.132 --> 11:02.066
Just...

11:02.132 --> 11:04.399
just leave her alone, guys.

11:05.299 --> 11:06.832
Let her go.

11:12.066 --> 11:13.832
You know, you look like you had

11:13.899 --> 11:15.799
a fucked-up night already, playboy.

11:15.865 --> 11:17.865
You know, I think it'd
be in your best interest

11:17.932 --> 11:21.466
to go on and get the fuck up out of here.

11:21.533 --> 11:24.099
Oh, don't worry about her. We
gonna take good care of her.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.266
I promise.

11:25.332 --> 11:26.799
Scout's honor.

11:29.899 --> 11:31.499
I can't let you do that.

11:36.499 --> 11:37.732
You deaf, motherfucker? Huh?

11:37.799 --> 11:39.299
I said get the fuck up out of here

11:39.366 --> 11:41.832
before I turn that pretty
mug of yours inside out.

11:41.899 --> 11:43.466
Yeah, he's fucking deaf.

11:43.533 --> 11:45.199
No, he's not deaf.

11:45.266 --> 11:46.599
He's crazy.

11:46.666 --> 11:48.765
Straight out the VA hospital.

11:48.832 --> 11:51.466
My boys said to take off.

12:13.832 --> 12:15.199
Where am I?

12:15.266 --> 12:17.965
Oh, Christ. You scared the shit out of me.

12:19.066 --> 12:21.965
I can't believe you're
alive, let alone awake.

12:23.433 --> 12:25.099
This is my place.

12:26.533 --> 12:28.699
I couldn't just leave
you back in that alley

12:28.765 --> 12:30.166
after what you did.

12:30.232 --> 12:31.899
What I did?

12:32.965 --> 12:35.199
I remember killing three people.

12:36.066 --> 12:37.666
You saved my life.

12:37.732 --> 12:39.266
Those assholes were going to rape me

12:39.332 --> 12:41.399
and throw me in a dumpster, so fuck them.

12:41.466 --> 12:43.199
They got what they deserved.

12:47.499 --> 12:49.865
You normally bring strangers
back to your apartment

12:49.932 --> 12:51.799
in the middle of the night and strip them?

12:53.266 --> 12:55.832
Depends on what kind of mood I'm in.

12:58.266 --> 13:01.566
Yeah, I just couldn't leave you
back there for the cops to find.

13:01.633 --> 13:04.899
A Black man lying next to three
bodies in this neighborhood?

13:04.965 --> 13:07.832
They wouldn't even stop to ask questions.

13:07.899 --> 13:09.899
Well, I'm all right.

13:10.732 --> 13:12.799
How is that even possible?

13:12.865 --> 13:14.533
This is not right.

13:15.965 --> 13:17.765
I'm gonna go get something out the kitchen.

13:17.832 --> 13:19.499
Just stay put.

14:30.032 --> 14:33.132
Hey, how did I end up in the alley with...?

14:33.199 --> 14:34.732
With... hey!

14:34.799 --> 14:36.332
Hello?

14:36.399 --> 14:37.832
Hey, you all right?

14:37.899 --> 14:41.166
She can't hear you, or
see you, for that matter.

14:42.566 --> 14:43.832
Excuse the intrusive theatrics.

14:43.899 --> 14:45.633
They're a necessary evil, I'm afraid.

14:45.699 --> 14:47.266
Who are you?

14:47.332 --> 14:49.299
Hello, Ray.

14:50.799 --> 14:52.299
Hellborn, at your service.

14:52.366 --> 14:53.999
You and I have a great
deal to discuss, my friend.

14:54.066 --> 14:55.633
How'd you get in here?

14:55.699 --> 14:57.099
Who sent you?

14:57.166 --> 14:59.433
And what the hell did you do to her?

14:59.499 --> 15:04.299
Well, she, as you can see,
is completely unharmed.

15:04.366 --> 15:07.166
And the question isn't who sent me, Ray.

15:07.232 --> 15:10.332
The question is, how are you still alive?

15:10.399 --> 15:13.832
Now I know that your
recollection of tonight's events

15:13.899 --> 15:16.232
may be a little... dicey.

15:16.299 --> 15:19.299
I mean, only hours ago you were dead.

15:19.366 --> 15:20.466
Losing one's memory

15:20.533 --> 15:22.166
is a temporary side effect to the wakening.

15:22.232 --> 15:23.299
It will pass.

15:23.366 --> 15:25.166
What the fuck are you talking about?

15:25.232 --> 15:28.132
You think you can just appear in
here and sell me some bullshit?

15:28.865 --> 15:30.232
So if you know who I am,

15:30.299 --> 15:32.099
then you know what I can do to you, right?

15:32.799 --> 15:34.799
Absolutely nothing.

15:40.199 --> 15:43.166
Attempting to hurt me will
only hurt yourself, Ray.

15:43.865 --> 15:45.166
What did you do to me?

15:45.232 --> 15:49.199
I gave you new life
and near God-like power.

15:51.366 --> 15:53.865
You gave me a curse.

15:53.932 --> 15:55.566
You should be thanking me right now,

15:55.633 --> 15:58.366
not feeling sorry for yourself.

15:58.433 --> 16:00.832
You have no idea what you've become.

16:02.633 --> 16:04.999
Those men you killed tonight?

16:06.599 --> 16:10.099
When you took their
lives, what did you feel?

16:13.332 --> 16:15.899
Confused at first.

16:15.965 --> 16:18.232
Then everything started becoming clear.

16:19.232 --> 16:23.166
I wanted to stop but I... I-I couldn't.

16:24.132 --> 16:26.765
That thing inside of you needs to kill.

16:26.832 --> 16:28.666
It's how you stay alive.

16:28.732 --> 16:31.199
You take their energy, their life force.

16:31.266 --> 16:35.066
You absorb their memories,
intelligence, fighting skills.

16:35.132 --> 16:38.199
Everything they were, you will become.

16:39.633 --> 16:42.132
You'll have the ability
to heal within minutes.

16:42.199 --> 16:44.932
Your muscles will be
stronger, your reflexes faster.

16:44.999 --> 16:48.332
- Why did you choose me?
- I didn't.

16:48.399 --> 16:50.066
I'm merely a guide.

16:50.132 --> 16:53.032
An overseer to aid you in your quest.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.499
Which is?

16:54.566 --> 16:57.832
To become the beast that feeds
on the hearts of evil men.

16:58.765 --> 17:00.466
Time to go.

17:08.399 --> 17:11.066
You don't have to come visit me anymore.

17:13.765 --> 17:16.433
I can see it causes you pain.

17:22.899 --> 17:24.732
Are the nurses treating you well enough?

17:24.799 --> 17:26.466
Yeah, they're fine.

17:27.932 --> 17:29.366
They're not much for conversation,

17:29.433 --> 17:32.066
but they take excellent care of me.

17:32.132 --> 17:34.299
Good.

17:34.366 --> 17:36.132
You know, it is important to me

17:36.199 --> 17:39.865
that you are as comfortable as possible.

17:41.266 --> 17:44.666
I have the best medical
minds around the country

17:44.732 --> 17:46.399
working on this.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.699
They will find you a cure for this...

17:49.765 --> 17:52.232
There is no cure, brother.

17:56.032 --> 17:59.032
Why must you torture yourself

17:59.099 --> 18:02.366
with false hopes of a world made whole?

18:03.566 --> 18:05.999
A world where we live happily every after.

18:06.066 --> 18:08.266
Don't be like that, Priscilla.

18:09.066 --> 18:11.099
Not after all this time.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.433
There is always a way.

18:15.732 --> 18:18.666
It's just going to take
a little time, that's all.

18:18.732 --> 18:20.533
And in that time,

18:20.599 --> 18:23.999
you will come to accept
the truth as I have.

18:25.166 --> 18:28.366
I've accepted is that I am going to die.

18:31.666 --> 18:33.832
And you will be all alone.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.899
I'm truly sorry.

18:44.633 --> 18:46.965
This, my dear sister...

18:48.099 --> 18:50.366
I will never accept.

19:21.199 --> 19:23.299
Love what you've done to the place.

19:23.732 --> 19:25.299
They must have broken in.

19:25.366 --> 19:29.166
Try and make my death look like a robbery.

19:29.232 --> 19:31.099
You're not the only one they've hurt, Ray.

19:31.166 --> 19:33.399
There are hundreds more who have suffered,

19:33.466 --> 19:35.266
and until now there hasn't been a being

19:35.332 --> 19:37.899
powerful enough to stop them.

19:37.965 --> 19:40.965
This is why we brought you back.

19:43.032 --> 19:45.199
How do I find the men that did this to me?

19:45.266 --> 19:49.932
Well, that is a question
whose answer you already know.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.199
There's a warehouse up on 87th.

20:03.699 --> 20:05.965
They use it to manufacture Synth,

20:06.032 --> 20:08.232
distribute to their key runners.

20:09.199 --> 20:10.832
One of those guys worked there.

20:10.899 --> 20:14.332
It gave him access to
what deals would go down.

20:16.999 --> 20:20.433
They would pose as buyers,
rob low-level runners,

20:21.199 --> 20:22.666
sell the product on their own

20:22.732 --> 20:24.932
and keep the money for themselves.

20:26.965 --> 20:28.399
I'm going to shut it down.

20:28.466 --> 20:31.433
They think you're dead.

20:31.499 --> 20:35.132
That gives us an advantage
we can build upon.

20:35.199 --> 20:36.799
I suggest concealing your identity.

20:36.865 --> 20:39.999
Is there anything in this
dump that can do that?

20:43.566 --> 20:45.099
Yeah.

20:47.666 --> 20:49.199
Hell, yeah.

22:16.765 --> 22:19.499
Let's go, guys, we got to
take these barrels out of here.

22:19.566 --> 22:22.266
Testament will have our
ass if we don't finish.

22:23.899 --> 22:25.032
How many barrels?

22:25.099 --> 22:27.166
All of them.

24:45.066 --> 24:48.099
Now that was worth the price of admission.

24:48.166 --> 24:52.366
You have truly become an artist, my friend.

24:56.032 --> 24:57.832
Don't touch me for a second.

24:57.899 --> 25:00.999
Ah, I need a fucking cigarette.

25:02.232 --> 25:04.232
Did you find what you were looking for?

25:04.299 --> 25:06.965
Information. Yeah.

25:07.666 --> 25:09.166
And what did you see?

25:11.199 --> 25:12.732
A friend.

25:22.299 --> 25:25.266
- Sir...
- Just...

25:32.533 --> 25:34.199
Such passion.

25:35.899 --> 25:38.899
Anyone who can create
something like that...

25:40.399 --> 25:44.232
has experienced a lifetime of pain.

25:47.099 --> 25:51.965
And only then can you realize that...

25:53.932 --> 25:55.832
what really matters...

25:56.765 --> 25:59.499
cannot be held in your hand.

26:00.899 --> 26:02.799
I trust this couldn't wait?

26:02.865 --> 26:04.199
No, sir, it couldn't.

26:04.266 --> 26:07.332
It's urgent.

26:07.399 --> 26:11.366
In that case, I'm going to need more wine.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.299
I'm sorry.

26:28.366 --> 26:34.166
That was the most perfect cut
of steak I think I've ever had.

26:35.599 --> 26:37.232
Perfect temperature.

26:37.299 --> 26:39.199
Perfect doneness.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.266
You know, even with the most

26:42.332 --> 26:45.533
extraordinary chef in my kitchen...

26:45.599 --> 26:50.332
I doubt that he will ever
be able to duplicate that.

26:53.799 --> 26:55.466
Do you understand?

26:56.732 --> 26:58.132
That your, um,

26:58.199 --> 27:01.366
inability to, um, focus...

27:03.700 --> 27:05.899
has taken that away from me.

27:06.699 --> 27:07.899
Forgive me. Maybe he...

27:07.965 --> 27:09.865
No, no, no.

27:20.932 --> 27:23.299
It's the little things that count.

27:24.166 --> 27:25.433
Indeed.

27:26.765 --> 27:30.266
I have something to show you.

27:40.433 --> 27:43.132
One man in a ski mask did all that?

27:43.199 --> 27:45.466
It gets even more interesting.

27:53.765 --> 27:55.865
That's impossible.

27:55.932 --> 27:58.232
I thought so too.

27:59.032 --> 28:00.499
We killed this man.

28:00.566 --> 28:03.366
Made sure that he was never coming back,

28:03.433 --> 28:06.099
but here he is,

28:06.799 --> 28:09.332
making trouble for us.

28:09.399 --> 28:12.865
So there's a question
swirling around my head.

28:12.932 --> 28:18.299
How is Ray Lazarus back from the dead?

28:18.366 --> 28:20.832
I would very much like to know that.

28:22.932 --> 28:24.999
I'm sending Gale to
pick up one of my runners

28:25.066 --> 28:28.965
who ran into some trouble the other night.

28:29.699 --> 28:31.999
Maybe she's seen something.

28:33.932 --> 28:35.899
Get it done.

28:50.633 --> 28:53.366
Just go ahead and top it off and
get it back to her, all right?

28:53.433 --> 28:55.965
- Right. Okay, thanks.
- Okay, thanks, buddy.

28:58.132 --> 28:59.433
Ray!

29:00.533 --> 29:02.099
I thought you were dead, man.

29:02.166 --> 29:03.865
I'm glad to see that ain't the case.

29:03.932 --> 29:05.399
Is that what you heard?

29:05.466 --> 29:07.699
No, you just hadn't been
here for a few months.

29:07.765 --> 29:08.965
That ain't like you, man.

29:09.032 --> 29:11.166
Look, I need to talk to you.

29:11.232 --> 29:12.499
Privately.

29:13.332 --> 29:15.332
Okay, man, right this way. Come on.

29:20.799 --> 29:22.566
So these people who work for you,

29:22.633 --> 29:24.032
you trust them?

29:24.099 --> 29:27.032
They wouldn't be here if I didn't.

29:27.099 --> 29:31.299
A few of them are ex-cons,
but they're decent.

29:31.366 --> 29:33.999
Just men and women that, uh, have families.

29:34.066 --> 29:35.732
They do right by me, so I do right by them.

29:35.799 --> 29:39.366
Got any reason to believe that
any of them might be dealing?

29:39.433 --> 29:41.232
What? That red shit I
see all over the street?

29:41.299 --> 29:42.433
Yeah.

29:42.499 --> 29:45.199
Nah.

29:45.266 --> 29:47.832
I just patched up the axle on
the old bird. Anything else?

29:47.899 --> 29:49.965
Go ahead and mount the
tires, that'd be great.

29:50.032 --> 29:51.232
I'll come over and check it out.

29:51.299 --> 29:53.166
Thank you.

29:54.765 --> 29:57.132
I see you ain't changed a bit.

29:58.466 --> 30:00.132
I'm a trendsetter.

30:01.999 --> 30:03.599
She's good for business.

30:03.666 --> 30:05.232
- Yeah, I bet.
- Hey...

30:06.499 --> 30:08.965
look, I lost a few recently,

30:09.032 --> 30:11.166
but that's just because
they get a better offer

30:11.232 --> 30:12.699
to run with Poet and his crew.

30:12.765 --> 30:15.199
What you know about him?

30:15.266 --> 30:16.999
He's in charge of sales and distribution

30:17.066 --> 30:19.066
for his organization,
but he's not the big man.

30:19.132 --> 30:22.765
Somebody else is in charge.
Somebody smart. Protected.

30:23.633 --> 30:25.132
Know who it is?

30:26.399 --> 30:28.299
Nobody's seen him.

30:28.366 --> 30:31.099
Why are you so interested all of a sudden?

30:31.166 --> 30:32.699
You want to get in the game?

30:32.765 --> 30:35.066
Nah, I'm just curious.

30:40.232 --> 30:43.466
Curiosity didn't bring
you all the way down here.

30:43.533 --> 30:48.399
Asking me some very specific,
very dangerous questions, man.

30:50.499 --> 30:52.699
Ray, I've know you for over ten years.

30:52.765 --> 30:54.765
You can't bullshit me.

30:54.832 --> 30:57.633
Don't do something that you might regret.

30:57.699 --> 31:00.299
Look, it's best if you don't
know right now, all right?

31:00.366 --> 31:03.999
Look, man, I got to jet. I'll be back.

31:04.066 --> 31:06.499
And, Pogo, do something
with your hair, man.

31:06.566 --> 31:07.965
It's all over the place.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.765
Fix it up or something.

31:09.832 --> 31:11.899
I'm about to take it all the way off.

31:11.965 --> 31:13.666
You just wait and see.

31:13.732 --> 31:16.466
It's going to be as smooth as a
baby's ass dipped in buttermilk.

31:16.533 --> 31:19.166
- Chicks love that.
- Don't know nothing about that.

31:19.232 --> 31:20.299
Yeah, I know.

31:20.366 --> 31:22.132
I've got some clippers in the back, man.

31:22.199 --> 31:24.332
- We'll tighten you up.
- Later, Pogo.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.166
What brings you by?

31:35.099 --> 31:37.865
I need to understand...

31:37.932 --> 31:40.599
how a dead man can still
bring me so much pain.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.433
A dead man?

31:43.366 --> 31:44.932
Did you kill him?

31:45.999 --> 31:47.765
I was a victim of circumstance.

31:47.832 --> 31:50.832
I was merely a instrument in his demise,

31:50.899 --> 31:53.099
not the cause of it.

31:54.732 --> 31:56.832
Demons that you create,

31:56.899 --> 31:59.299
what will you do when they come knocking?

32:00.699 --> 32:02.433
I was hoping you'd tell me.

32:05.399 --> 32:08.199
Well, let's see
what the cards have to say.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.232
Well, what do you see?

32:58.299 --> 32:59.533
A man.

32:59.599 --> 33:03.433
His body is broken, but
his spirit is strong.

33:04.633 --> 33:06.332
That's why you chose him.

33:07.499 --> 33:09.533
Brought him back.

33:09.599 --> 33:12.166
How is this possible?

33:12.232 --> 33:14.166
There is an ancient power that exists.

33:14.232 --> 33:15.799
Older than time.

33:15.865 --> 33:18.032
It is neither good nor evil...

33:19.232 --> 33:23.332
but it holds life and death
in the palm of its hand.

33:23.399 --> 33:25.066
So he's an immortal then?

33:25.132 --> 33:26.899
No.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.832
This power feeds on energy.

33:30.865 --> 33:32.332
In order to continue living,

33:32.399 --> 33:35.799
he must absorb the life force of others.

33:36.499 --> 33:38.299
And he's not alone.

33:38.366 --> 33:39.999
What do you mean?

33:41.299 --> 33:43.865
Well, there is something here.
Something is there with him.

33:43.932 --> 33:46.433
- Something is guiding him.
- This power...

33:47.566 --> 33:49.032
can it be taken?

33:49.965 --> 33:52.166
Transferred to someone else somehow?

33:52.599 --> 33:53.799
Yes.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.032
So, what you need to do

33:56.099 --> 34:00.799
is send in your strongest
man to break his spirit.

34:01.732 --> 34:03.865
Then you can own his power.

34:25.566 --> 34:27.066
Jesus.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.066
You know what? You don't
get to do that to me.

34:29.132 --> 34:31.366
I need answers I couldn't find here.

34:31.433 --> 34:34.066
You save my life and then
bleed all over my couch,

34:34.132 --> 34:36.832
and then disappear for not one but two days

34:36.899 --> 34:38.932
without leaving so much
as a goddamn sticky note

34:38.999 --> 34:40.533
to let me know you're still alive?

34:40.599 --> 34:42.965
Look, I can explain everything
if you just calm down.

34:43.032 --> 34:44.232
And then you stroll back in here

34:44.299 --> 34:46.399
as if you have some open invitation.

34:46.466 --> 34:48.266
- Look, I wasn't trying to be...
- I'm sorry.

34:48.332 --> 34:50.466
Don't let the fact that
my fucking door is locked

34:50.533 --> 34:52.366
prevent you in any way
from breaking into my home.

34:52.433 --> 34:55.066
Enough, all right? I
didn't mean to startle you,

34:55.132 --> 34:57.232
and I'm not trying to
make your life complicated,

34:57.299 --> 34:59.099
but there's some things happening right now

34:59.166 --> 35:00.899
that you couldn't possibly understand.

35:00.965 --> 35:04.732
Some things I barely can comprehend myself.

35:05.266 --> 35:06.433
Try me.

35:06.499 --> 35:10.266
Poet, your boss, the guy
you've been running for.

35:10.332 --> 35:12.499
- I never told you that.
- Well, you didn't have to.

35:12.566 --> 35:15.865
He and his men are killers,
but there's somebody else.

35:15.932 --> 35:17.599
Somebody pulling the strings,

35:17.666 --> 35:20.199
and I need for you to tell me
everything you know about him.

35:20.266 --> 35:22.533
So you're trying to get
yourself killed then?

35:22.599 --> 35:24.633
I'm not worried about that.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.832
Not anymore.

35:27.699 --> 35:29.399
Fine.

35:30.132 --> 35:31.965
He calls himself Testament.

35:32.032 --> 35:34.299
He controls all of Paradise City,

35:34.366 --> 35:35.799
and he's untouchable.

35:35.865 --> 35:38.032
Satisfied?

35:38.099 --> 35:39.399
You know what? Never mind.

35:39.466 --> 35:41.266
It doesn't even matter, because I'm out.

35:41.332 --> 35:43.899
I'm getting as far away from
this shit as I possibly can,

35:43.965 --> 35:45.965
and if you have any
brains, you'd do the same.

35:46.032 --> 35:48.232
I can't walk away, and
you're not safe by yourself.

35:48.299 --> 35:50.232
He's taken way too much from this city.

35:50.299 --> 35:51.666
From you, from me.

35:51.732 --> 35:53.832
It's time somebody stopped him.

35:53.899 --> 35:55.399
Why do you care?

35:55.466 --> 35:57.433
What has he taken from you?

36:09.633 --> 36:11.466
Search every inch of this place.

37:04.633 --> 37:06.433
What the hell?

37:19.666 --> 37:21.599
You know this building
was built upon a church

37:21.666 --> 37:24.433
that burnt to the ground
during the grand crusades?

37:25.466 --> 37:28.299
Hundreds of people were trapped inside.

37:28.366 --> 37:32.166
Innocent men, women and
children died right here,

37:32.799 --> 37:34.499
on this very spot.

37:36.999 --> 37:38.366
If you listen closely enough,

37:38.433 --> 37:41.899
you can almost hear them still crying out.

37:42.932 --> 37:45.366
"Help me. Help."

37:47.433 --> 37:49.999
No one on earth is
innocent, not even children.

37:50.066 --> 37:52.732
Must we engage in these
senseless initiations

37:52.799 --> 37:54.533
every time we meet?

37:55.699 --> 37:58.965
Levity is important to
building lasting relationships.

37:59.865 --> 38:02.765
I mean, we are partners, after all.

38:04.266 --> 38:07.599
I trust you'll do your part
in finding Lazarus's opposite?

38:07.666 --> 38:09.366
It's already begun.

38:09.433 --> 38:11.700
The fortune-teller was
easy enough to convince,

38:11.765 --> 38:15.366
and a suitable candidate has been chosen.

38:15.433 --> 38:16.765
It's only a matter of time

38:16.832 --> 38:18.932
until his death and eventual awakening.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.366
Good.

38:21.433 --> 38:24.199
I'll make sure to keep
the path clear on my end.

38:27.799 --> 38:29.332
Keep in touch.

38:32.832 --> 38:34.865
You got to let me know
before you come by, man.

38:34.932 --> 38:37.166
I could've had a lady in here.

38:39.199 --> 38:41.832
I could've been knee-deep in
the throes of passion, man.

38:41.899 --> 38:43.466
Just moments away from euphoria,

38:43.533 --> 38:45.700
and you guys would've
ruined it for both of us.

38:45.765 --> 38:47.366
Were you?

38:48.399 --> 38:50.132
No, I was watching TV and sipping a beer,

38:50.199 --> 38:52.232
but that's not the point, all right?

38:52.299 --> 38:54.466
Not the point. It's about boundaries, bro.

38:54.533 --> 38:55.832
Boundaries.

38:55.899 --> 38:58.066
Look, man, we just need a place to crash.

38:58.132 --> 39:01.132
Lay low for awhile till
I figure some things out.

39:01.832 --> 39:02.965
No.

39:03.032 --> 39:04.399
No, no, no, no, no.

39:04.466 --> 39:07.932
You're not pulling this
shit on me again, Ray.

39:07.999 --> 39:10.199
Not unless you tell me what is going on.

39:10.266 --> 39:12.499
- Until then, no dice.
- If you guys could just,

39:12.566 --> 39:14.799
you know, skip the
foreplay and figure it out,

39:14.865 --> 39:16.999
I'm going to make myself at home.

39:21.865 --> 39:23.533
She's making herself at home, Ray.

39:23.599 --> 39:25.999
She's making herself at
home. What's going on here?

39:26.066 --> 39:27.332
What does she...? What's...?

39:27.399 --> 39:28.999
Look, she's finishing my beer, Ray.

39:29.066 --> 39:31.132
She's finishing... Thank
you, thank you for that.

39:31.199 --> 39:33.132
- That was my last one.
- Look, man,

39:33.199 --> 39:35.499
we just need to stay
here for a couple of days,

39:35.566 --> 39:37.299
till I end all of this for good.

39:39.566 --> 39:41.032
How was it?

39:41.999 --> 39:43.399
It was, uh, euphoric.

39:43.466 --> 39:44.832
Funny.

39:44.899 --> 39:46.366
She's funny, Ray, I'll give you that.

39:46.433 --> 39:48.366
- She's fun...
- Pogo, listen to me, okay?

39:48.433 --> 39:51.466
I need for you to focus right now.

39:51.533 --> 39:53.699
Now, look, a lot of
people are about to die,

39:53.765 --> 39:56.232
but Pogo, I need for you

39:56.299 --> 39:58.899
to roll with me with
me on this one, brother.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.433
Ray, I love you, man, but...

40:05.166 --> 40:07.299
I got to be all the way in.

40:08.533 --> 40:10.399
You sure you want to know?

40:10.466 --> 40:12.433
Dude, I've got your back no matter what,

40:12.499 --> 40:14.599
but you've got to clue me in.

40:14.666 --> 40:16.266
Show him.

40:16.332 --> 40:20.032
He's not going to take your
word for it, so just show him.

40:23.199 --> 40:26.366
Four days ago I was
approached by Poet and his men.

40:26.433 --> 40:27.932
He knew all about me.

40:27.999 --> 40:30.032
Knew I was familiar with the city.

40:30.099 --> 40:34.132
He needed some strong runners
who could handle themselves.

40:34.832 --> 40:36.266
I turned them down,

40:36.332 --> 40:39.032
but by then he already said too much.

40:39.099 --> 40:42.765
Guess it was way too dangerous
to keep me alive, I guess.

40:42.832 --> 40:44.699
Oh, okay, so what does that mean?

40:44.765 --> 40:46.433
- What are you saying?
- He shot me.

40:46.499 --> 40:50.099
Ten, twelve times, at least.

40:50.965 --> 40:52.366
How'd you survive?

40:52.433 --> 40:54.832
I didn't.

40:58.499 --> 40:59.732
Okay, I get it.

40:59.799 --> 41:01.832
You're joking, you're joking.

41:01.899 --> 41:05.433
It's funny. I get it. You're joking.

41:05.499 --> 41:07.566
- Right?
- I'm serious.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.999
No, no, no, no, no, no.
See, I should have known.

41:10.066 --> 41:12.099
You bring a really hot girl to my place

41:12.166 --> 41:13.633
like she's questionable, she's hot.

41:13.699 --> 41:16.032
And you bring her here,
work, place of business.

41:16.099 --> 41:18.366
And then it's just... It's
too good to be true, man.

41:18.433 --> 41:20.366
It's too good to be true. I
get it... What are you doing?

41:20.433 --> 41:22.765
What are you doing? Why are you doing that?

41:31.932 --> 41:33.765
Okay, what the hell?

41:35.566 --> 41:39.266
Look, I know this is a
lot to take in right now.

41:43.999 --> 41:46.466
I just need... I need a
minute. I need a minute, man.

41:48.099 --> 41:50.266
Look, I'm going to go calm him down.

41:50.332 --> 41:52.466
But look, I need for you
to stay here, all right?

41:52.533 --> 41:56.865
You know, I got somebody
I got to go pay a visit to.

41:56.932 --> 41:59.865
You expect me to stay here with
fake-ass Matthew McConaughey?

41:59.932 --> 42:01.533
Look, I trust him with my life.

42:01.599 --> 42:03.533
If I didn't, I wouldn't have
brought you here, all right?

42:03.599 --> 42:05.832
But it's way too dangerous
for you out there,

42:05.899 --> 42:08.700
so I need for you to
just keep him safe for me.

42:08.765 --> 42:10.032
Can you do that?

42:10.099 --> 42:12.799
I expect to be compensated handsomely

42:12.865 --> 42:15.132
for my contribution to this cause.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.999
Look, whatever it is that you need,

42:17.066 --> 42:19.433
I got you, all right?

42:19.499 --> 42:20.865
Okay.

42:22.732 --> 42:25.199
Pogo, if they find
out that I'm still alive,

42:25.266 --> 42:27.099
anybody that's connected to
me is going to be targeted.

42:27.166 --> 42:28.799
Well, maybe they shouldn't.

42:28.865 --> 42:32.466
Maybe they shouldn't find out
that you're still alive, like...

42:34.499 --> 42:37.166
Okay there's something
I've been working on, if...

42:37.232 --> 42:39.366
if you give me a few hours...

42:40.366 --> 42:42.232
give me a few hours, I'll have it ready.

42:42.299 --> 42:45.832
- Okay.
- And... you need a shirt.

42:54.799 --> 42:56.399
Good morning, princess.

42:56.466 --> 42:57.666
Time to pay a call.

42:57.732 --> 42:59.499
Ain't got nothing to say, asshole.

42:59.566 --> 43:03.032
Oh, it's not me you need
to worry about, pretty boy.

43:03.765 --> 43:05.466
You get to talk to him.

43:07.332 --> 43:09.533
What, you're not going to score me out too?

43:09.599 --> 43:13.466
You like them five-footers?
Huh? That's what you like?

43:36.199 --> 43:37.732
Mike.

43:39.032 --> 43:40.699
Ray, is that you?

43:40.765 --> 43:42.533
Of course, man. What you doing here?

43:42.599 --> 43:44.299
Oh, man.

43:48.633 --> 43:49.765
Whoo!

43:49.832 --> 43:51.832
Had a few drinks.

43:51.899 --> 43:53.932
What was that all about?

43:55.099 --> 43:57.899
These assholes said some
things I didn't like.

44:00.232 --> 44:02.099
So, when did you decide to come back?

44:02.166 --> 44:05.199
I thought you was done
with this place for good.

44:05.266 --> 44:06.899
Synthetic drugs.

44:09.332 --> 44:11.865
You know my sister Carol died from it.

44:14.633 --> 44:15.899
I wasn't even there for her.

44:15.965 --> 44:17.999
I didn't even know she was using.

44:19.832 --> 44:21.466
Hey, yo, Mike, I'm sorry.

44:24.032 --> 44:25.765
That's why I'm here, Ray.

44:27.099 --> 44:30.366
To take out Poet and his whole crew.

44:30.433 --> 44:33.099
Well, you know Poet just runs distribution.

44:33.732 --> 44:35.332
He's not the boss.

44:35.399 --> 44:36.999
How do you know that?

44:37.066 --> 44:39.199
Let's take a ride.

44:39.266 --> 44:41.399
I'll explain more when we get there.

44:43.332 --> 44:44.732
Where are we going?

44:44.799 --> 44:46.332
Pogo's place.

44:46.399 --> 44:47.865
A spot downtown.

44:47.932 --> 44:49.232
You remember?

44:49.299 --> 44:51.399
Yeah. Pogo's still boosting cars?

44:51.466 --> 44:53.032
Nah.

44:53.099 --> 44:54.765
Hey, wait, you driving?

44:54.832 --> 44:56.433
No, I'm on foot.

44:57.566 --> 44:59.999
Well, you're more than
welcome to ride bitch.

45:01.232 --> 45:02.366
I'm good, man.

45:02.433 --> 45:03.599
I'll meet you there.

45:04.899 --> 45:07.132
- Suit yourself.
- All right.

45:19.099 --> 45:20.633
Has he said anything?

45:20.700 --> 45:22.965
Nah, nothing since we
picked him up this morning.

45:23.032 --> 45:26.366
Good. Wouldn't be much
of a challenge if he had.

45:26.433 --> 45:28.499
He's nuts, this guy.

45:28.566 --> 45:30.732
We dragged him out of
his apartment bathroom

45:30.799 --> 45:32.132
covered in blood.

45:32.199 --> 45:34.699
Ben, he was trying to remove his own skin

45:34.765 --> 45:36.366
with nothing but his fingernails.

45:36.433 --> 45:39.166
Well, it's a good job you
got there when you did.

45:39.232 --> 45:41.865
I'll take it from here. Thanks, Alex.

45:42.999 --> 45:44.765
You got it, boss.

45:48.199 --> 45:49.366
Good luck.

45:49.433 --> 45:51.066
You're going to need it.

46:01.533 --> 46:05.132
When was the last time
you saw this man alive?

46:05.199 --> 46:08.799
Two, maybe three days ago.

46:10.066 --> 46:11.932
I didn't see him. We spoke on the phone.

46:11.999 --> 46:14.032
About anything in particular?

46:14.099 --> 46:16.765
Yeah, what he wanted for dinner.

46:18.566 --> 46:20.799
Aside from that.

46:20.865 --> 46:25.399
Did he mention anyone's name?
Did he seem agitated or upset?

46:25.466 --> 46:27.865
I don't know, man. I'm
not a fucking shrink.

46:27.932 --> 46:30.299
Look, this is all I have,

46:30.366 --> 46:32.032
so if this is all you need from me,

46:32.099 --> 46:35.266
I'll gladly be on my way
and back to living my life.

46:35.965 --> 46:37.899
Forgive my manners.

46:38.599 --> 46:40.132
My name is Benjamin Poge.

46:40.199 --> 46:43.732
I handle cases that are unique in nature.

46:43.799 --> 46:46.032
Like you and your friend here.

46:46.099 --> 46:48.832
He ain't my friend. Like I told you before,

46:48.899 --> 46:51.066
he rented a room from me
for the past three months.

46:51.132 --> 46:53.865
That's it. He paid on time.

46:53.932 --> 46:55.299
We barely even spoke.

46:55.366 --> 46:58.099
That's the full extent of our relationship.

46:58.166 --> 47:01.066
So, whatever you think he's
into, I'm not, all right?

47:01.132 --> 47:04.433
From the looks of it, you look
like you're into his supply.

47:05.765 --> 47:07.099
Synth, right?

47:07.166 --> 47:09.533
That's what you were using this morning.

47:10.566 --> 47:13.499
That's why your nails are covered in blood

47:13.566 --> 47:15.366
and you can't sit still.

47:15.433 --> 47:17.499
You must be in a tremendous amount of pain

47:17.566 --> 47:19.066
coming down from that high.

47:19.132 --> 47:21.533
Realizing what you did to yourself.

47:21.599 --> 47:25.999
I'm just trying to help you,
Evan, and others like you.

47:26.066 --> 47:28.566
So just tell me who
your roommate worked for,

47:28.633 --> 47:30.366
and you go home.

47:30.433 --> 47:32.032
Simple.

47:32.099 --> 47:34.666
I don't know who he is or
what you're even talking about.

47:39.999 --> 47:42.999
You know what a polygraph is?

47:43.066 --> 47:44.533
When a human being tells a lie,

47:44.599 --> 47:46.965
it comes from deep
within their subconscious.

47:47.032 --> 47:49.799
It doesn't matter how they
string the words together,

47:49.865 --> 47:53.332
the body will always tell the truth.

47:54.633 --> 47:56.166
It's unavoidable.

47:57.965 --> 48:02.732
Polygraphs record several
physiological patterns

48:02.799 --> 48:05.433
such as blood pressure,

48:06.566 --> 48:09.099
pulse, respiration,

48:09.732 --> 48:11.899
and skin conductivity

48:11.965 --> 48:13.633
while the subject is being asked

48:13.699 --> 48:16.232
and answers a series of questions

48:16.299 --> 48:19.732
in the belief that deceptive answers

48:19.799 --> 48:21.399
will produce a response

48:21.466 --> 48:25.999
that differs from the
answers that are true.

48:28.699 --> 48:31.199
What does any of that even mean?

48:33.032 --> 48:34.932
By applying oneself,

48:35.932 --> 48:37.832
this skill, believe it or not,

48:37.899 --> 48:40.066
can be perfected over time.

48:40.132 --> 48:44.366
It's how I know you're
lying to me right now.

48:44.433 --> 48:47.799
I suggest you tell me everything
you know about this man

48:47.865 --> 48:49.332
and who he worked for.

48:49.399 --> 48:52.433
Otherwise, you're going
to a mental institution

48:52.499 --> 48:54.799
instead of going home.

48:55.533 --> 48:57.166
Your choice.

48:57.633 --> 48:59.299
Okay.

49:04.666 --> 49:06.266
Okay.

49:15.765 --> 49:17.366
How'd you get here before me?

49:17.433 --> 49:19.132
Uber.

49:19.765 --> 49:20.765
Oh.

49:26.399 --> 49:28.099
What took you so long?

49:32.633 --> 49:34.466
Special gift for Pogo.

49:35.899 --> 49:37.533
The stores were closed,

49:37.599 --> 49:39.799
so I got these from home.

49:39.865 --> 49:41.366
And beers, no less.

49:41.433 --> 49:45.266
I'm going to drink them
in good health, my friend.

49:45.332 --> 49:48.799
And I see you're still dressing
like a young Willie Nelson, huh?

49:49.865 --> 49:51.599
I see you still shop at Bass Pro.

49:51.666 --> 49:53.399
It's cool.

49:53.466 --> 49:56.099
Mike, I thought you were done
with this town for good, man.

49:56.166 --> 49:58.566
- When'd you get back?
- Got back a couple of days ago.

49:58.633 --> 50:00.199
Where's Ember?

50:01.099 --> 50:02.633
She's just hanging out, you know.

50:02.699 --> 50:05.032
She's not dealing with
everything too good right now.

50:05.099 --> 50:07.199
Yeah, well, the whole
world changed overnight.

50:07.266 --> 50:09.932
That's hard for anybody to accept.

50:11.633 --> 50:15.599
Indeed. So, where'd you
find this old salty dog at?

50:15.666 --> 50:19.899
He was in the back alley of
a bar, fighting, as usual.

50:20.499 --> 50:22.433
Hey, they had it coming.

50:22.499 --> 50:24.132
But, uh...

50:24.199 --> 50:27.066
any one of those rust
buckets out back work?

50:27.132 --> 50:28.732
- I need a ride for a while.
- Yeah.

50:28.799 --> 50:31.499
For the most part they just
need a few things here and there.

50:31.566 --> 50:34.199
If you want to pick the old
bird you can, see what sticks.

50:34.266 --> 50:37.965
Just... Winter's asleep,
right there in the back seat.

50:38.032 --> 50:40.666
Just try not to scare her, will you?

50:40.732 --> 50:42.132
Got you.

50:42.199 --> 50:44.366
And don't leave
a stain on the jacket.

50:44.433 --> 50:45.666
Funny.

50:45.732 --> 50:47.599
There's something I want to show you.

50:47.666 --> 50:49.232
Yeah. What's up?

50:57.899 --> 50:59.499
There it is.

51:05.399 --> 51:07.633
Took me years of work
and a boatload of cash,

51:07.699 --> 51:10.232
but she's one of a kind.

51:10.299 --> 51:12.232
What made you come up with this?

51:13.399 --> 51:15.799
Remember that accident I
had about six years back?

51:15.865 --> 51:17.965
Yeah, you took that curve
going about 85, right?

51:18.032 --> 51:19.700
Yeah, turned my back into a pretzel.

51:19.765 --> 51:21.399
Almost killed me.

51:21.466 --> 51:23.965
So when I got back on my feet,
I decided to make something

51:24.032 --> 51:26.499
that would protect me no
matter how fast I was going.

51:27.266 --> 51:28.499
Damn.

51:29.533 --> 51:31.166
It looks aggressive.

51:33.466 --> 51:35.865
Oh, she is.

51:36.999 --> 51:38.999
It's a tri-weave fiber.

51:39.066 --> 51:40.366
So you tear it apart,

51:40.433 --> 51:44.232
the fibers, they bond back together.

51:44.299 --> 51:46.932
The inner core is a flexible Kevlar fabric.

51:47.666 --> 51:48.965
Helmet's lined with it too.

51:49.032 --> 51:51.066
It's indestructible.

51:52.566 --> 51:54.466
Look, I can't fight alongside you, brother,

51:54.533 --> 51:57.132
but maybe I can give you
this, help keep you safe.

51:58.266 --> 51:59.765
There's a bike?

52:00.666 --> 52:02.332
Oh, yeah.

52:07.366 --> 52:09.299
Damn, Pogo.

52:20.433 --> 52:22.799
You should be resting.

52:23.466 --> 52:25.099
I've rested enough.

52:25.166 --> 52:28.299
Lying there makes me feel
like I'm already dead.

52:30.232 --> 52:32.666
This life...

52:32.732 --> 52:35.099
what do you think it means to them?

52:35.899 --> 52:37.799
Absolutely nothing.

52:39.566 --> 52:42.399
They truly have never lived.

52:42.965 --> 52:44.899
Only suffered.

52:45.965 --> 52:48.765
Desperately hanging on to their hope.

52:49.499 --> 52:51.299
A miserable existence.

52:52.633 --> 52:56.699
A fate we should be fortunate not to share.

52:56.765 --> 52:59.466
I'd give anything to be one of them.

53:02.266 --> 53:04.066
To be whole.

53:08.566 --> 53:10.032
That's why I'm here.

53:10.099 --> 53:12.499
I think I've found a cure for your problem.

53:12.566 --> 53:14.166
No.

53:14.232 --> 53:16.232
It'll take a little bit more time,

53:16.299 --> 53:18.566
but I have the wheels in motion.

53:18.633 --> 53:20.666
It's not possible.

53:20.732 --> 53:24.799
I have been examined by every
credible doctor in the world,

53:24.865 --> 53:26.599
and the diagnosis is always the same.

53:26.666 --> 53:28.399
There is no cure.

53:28.466 --> 53:30.299
No natural cure.

53:30.366 --> 53:33.332
Look, I can't explain everything right now.

53:33.399 --> 53:36.899
But I need you to find comfort in my words.

53:37.799 --> 53:39.332
Hey.

53:40.199 --> 53:42.366
I will never let you fade.

53:43.499 --> 53:45.299
Like our parents?

54:04.533 --> 54:07.732
How many years did we spend...

54:09.666 --> 54:12.399
watching our mother just waste away?

54:15.066 --> 54:19.366
And our father just standing there.

54:20.499 --> 54:22.965
And all the resources that we had...

54:24.700 --> 54:26.433
he did nothing...

54:28.999 --> 54:33.032
except hold her hand...

54:34.999 --> 54:38.732
and shed tears for a life not yet lost.

54:40.865 --> 54:44.899
I will not repeat the same mistakes.

54:46.865 --> 54:48.466
We won't.

54:49.633 --> 54:52.232
We won't. Hey, we're
stronger than they were.

54:54.266 --> 54:57.066
Hey, I believe you can save me.

54:57.932 --> 55:00.199
I believe in you, brother.

55:11.700 --> 55:13.232
Mike?

55:14.566 --> 55:16.199
Kit Kat.

55:16.266 --> 55:17.999
Hey, what's up?

55:18.799 --> 55:19.999
Dang, you've gotten big.

55:20.066 --> 55:22.199
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

55:22.266 --> 55:24.932
Stuck here with my brother
until I find my own place.

55:24.999 --> 55:27.399
Yeah? How's the college life?

55:27.466 --> 55:28.732
Dead.

55:28.799 --> 55:31.232
What? You're not in school anymore?

55:31.299 --> 55:34.999
I got kicked out for setting
this girl's hair on fire.

55:35.799 --> 55:37.899
You know that was stupid, right?

55:38.633 --> 55:40.566
You had a way out.

55:40.633 --> 55:41.965
You should have taken it.

55:42.032 --> 55:43.932
Nobody makes it out of here.

55:43.999 --> 55:46.399
And we always come back.

55:46.466 --> 55:49.132
That's what makes us all so dark inside.

55:49.199 --> 55:52.099
But when Ray came back,
he was like a new man.

55:52.166 --> 55:54.765
He even got my brother to go legit.

55:55.799 --> 55:57.433
He was always a good guy, you know?

55:57.499 --> 55:59.499
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

56:01.466 --> 56:05.066
Oh, well, let's see what
we can do with this baby.

56:07.299 --> 56:08.999
Hey.

56:11.999 --> 56:13.999
I can't go back, can I?

56:14.799 --> 56:16.399
No.

56:21.999 --> 56:23.899
You know what I keep thinking about?

56:24.533 --> 56:26.132
My shoes.

56:26.199 --> 56:28.399
I had some really expensive
pairs of shoes at that loft,

56:28.466 --> 56:31.166
and now I can't go back to collect them.

56:31.533 --> 56:32.965
Right.

56:33.032 --> 56:34.865
I can see how this might
be a little difficult

56:34.932 --> 56:36.832
to shoulder right now.

56:36.899 --> 56:40.732
But it'll be over the
moment I stop Testament.

56:41.732 --> 56:43.199
What if you don't make it?

56:43.266 --> 56:45.633
What if you don't come back?

56:45.699 --> 56:47.299
What will the rest of us do?

56:48.599 --> 56:52.666
Look, Mike, Pogo, Winter,
they're not just my friends.

56:52.732 --> 56:54.433
They're my family, okay?

56:54.499 --> 56:58.132
We always protect one another,
and I trust them with my life.

57:01.899 --> 57:04.299
Listen, you're my family now.

57:04.366 --> 57:07.433
And I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

57:09.266 --> 57:10.799
Um...

57:11.533 --> 57:12.599
you're touching my leg.

57:12.666 --> 57:14.865
Oh. Oh, no, no, that's...

57:14.932 --> 57:18.599
It's just a way that I
could just reassure you

57:18.666 --> 57:20.533
that everything just is okay...

57:20.599 --> 57:23.799
I'm not mad at it, I'm just...
Can I get a dinner first?

57:23.865 --> 57:26.965
Or maybe some nice conversation?

57:27.032 --> 57:29.032
Yeah, we can go eat.

57:29.099 --> 57:32.332
We can talk and have a conversation.

57:32.399 --> 57:34.099
Sushi or something.

57:34.166 --> 57:35.132
Whatever.

57:36.433 --> 57:38.199
Hey, hey, hey.

57:38.266 --> 57:40.699
I got some people I want you to meet.

57:40.765 --> 57:42.832
Tay. Rico.

57:43.765 --> 57:45.299
Fellas.

57:46.299 --> 57:47.799
What are you guys doing here?

57:47.865 --> 57:49.666
Hey, man, heard you could use some help.

57:51.332 --> 57:53.566
Hey, your fight
is our fight, man, always.

57:53.633 --> 57:56.433
Yeah, Laz, you know we couldn't
let you have all the fun.

57:56.499 --> 57:58.232
Well, it's good to see you guys, man.

57:58.299 --> 58:02.499
Oh, this is Pogo, that's
Ember and that's Winter.

58:03.099 --> 58:05.332
Oh. What up?

58:05.932 --> 58:07.433
Hey, what's up?

58:08.332 --> 58:09.299
Hey.

58:09.366 --> 58:11.299
Winter, huh? As in the coldest?

58:11.366 --> 58:14.533
- Mm-hm.
- I feel that. I like that.

58:14.599 --> 58:16.199
Uh-uh.

58:17.965 --> 58:19.332
My bad, bro.

58:19.399 --> 58:20.633
It's okay.

58:20.699 --> 58:22.399
We did a little recon.

58:22.466 --> 58:23.799
A couple low profile,

58:23.865 --> 58:25.566
staked the place out
for three days straight.

58:25.633 --> 58:28.166
The building's two stories
high, there's four entrances.

58:28.232 --> 58:30.166
There's about 20 more guys inside.

58:30.232 --> 58:32.799
Five of them be armed with
shotguns and automatics.

58:32.865 --> 58:35.399
The rest are runners,
so they're not carrying.

58:35.466 --> 58:37.032
So you know the deal, boys.

58:37.099 --> 58:39.433
Let's get these gunmen before
they can get a shot off.

58:39.499 --> 58:41.533
Well, that place
is locked down tight too.

58:41.599 --> 58:43.832
Yeah, there's a few guards in parked cars.

58:43.899 --> 58:45.899
They're surrounding the place, all right?

58:45.965 --> 58:47.533
Shipments only go after 9:00 p.m.

58:47.599 --> 58:49.066
After that it's pretty quiet.

58:49.132 --> 58:50.932
The building's pretty
much ours for the taking.

58:50.999 --> 58:54.499
If that place goes it'll
cripple the business for good.

58:54.566 --> 58:56.499
Well, I guess that's where we headed then.

58:56.566 --> 58:58.899
You heard him, boys.
We got our marching orders.

58:58.965 --> 59:01.965
Wheels up in five minutes.

59:02.032 --> 59:03.932
All right, let's go, killers.

59:05.199 --> 59:06.899
Pogo?

59:11.332 --> 59:13.732
I got to get out of this
place for a little bit.

59:13.799 --> 59:16.032
Whoa, you sure that's a good idea?

59:16.099 --> 59:17.666
Ray said to stay here.

59:17.732 --> 59:19.433
This is the safest place for you.

59:20.699 --> 59:22.399
You always do what you're told?

1:00:00.666 --> 1:00:02.232
Jesus Christ.

1:00:02.299 --> 1:00:03.865
Remind you of
those week-old chitlins, huh?

1:00:03.932 --> 1:00:05.999
Yeah, I won't be eating those anymore.

1:00:07.932 --> 1:00:09.799
Check his wallet.

1:00:17.566 --> 1:00:20.399
Looks like your suspect gave
us some good information.

1:00:21.865 --> 1:00:23.899
Too bad it's a dead end.

1:00:24.832 --> 1:00:26.566
Not entirely.

1:00:26.633 --> 1:00:28.433
It's all here.

1:00:29.899 --> 1:00:32.099
Factories, shipping routes,

1:00:32.166 --> 1:00:33.999
dates.

1:00:34.066 --> 1:00:35.299
All the connective tissue

1:00:35.366 --> 1:00:38.533
that holds their organization together.

1:00:38.599 --> 1:00:39.732
It's right in front of us.

1:00:39.799 --> 1:00:41.366
This is huge.

1:00:41.433 --> 1:00:42.666
We got to call it in.

1:00:42.732 --> 1:00:44.332
No.

1:00:44.399 --> 1:00:46.099
Call in the movers.

1:00:46.166 --> 1:00:48.999
Have them take care of it.

1:00:49.066 --> 1:00:51.232
Everything else stays as is.

1:00:51.299 --> 1:00:53.799
You think this guy and
those other bodies we found

1:00:53.865 --> 1:00:56.433
are all connected?

1:00:56.499 --> 1:00:57.832
Possibly.

1:00:57.899 --> 1:01:00.399
Unlike the others, this
was a precision job.

1:01:00.466 --> 1:01:03.832
The other killings were
more brutal, personal.

1:01:04.633 --> 1:01:07.166
But we count nothing out.

1:01:07.232 --> 1:01:09.466
Because unless I miss my guess...

1:01:10.732 --> 1:01:12.999
this is only the beginning.

1:01:48.099 --> 1:01:49.899
Nice helmet.

1:01:50.699 --> 1:01:52.466
Hey, y'all, let him through.

1:02:18.366 --> 1:02:20.099
Hey, that shit's dope.

1:02:21.232 --> 1:02:22.865
Impressive.

1:02:38.399 --> 1:02:40.999
This is
BLWC, and I'm Sean Wesley.

1:02:41.066 --> 1:02:43.499
Joining me once again in
the studio is Robin O'Reilly.

1:02:43.566 --> 1:02:45.732
Hey, Sean. Thanks
for having me again.

1:02:45.799 --> 1:02:47.499
Always nice to
have you here with me.

1:02:47.566 --> 1:02:50.399
So, Robin, the Synth
problem, it's not going away.

1:02:50.466 --> 1:02:52.932
What are you seeing? What
you hearing in the streets?

1:02:52.999 --> 1:02:54.633
It's definitely not going away.

1:02:54.699 --> 1:02:57.099
One, I think we need to bring
more eyes to Paradise City.

1:02:57.166 --> 1:02:59.166
I feel like nobody's
looking at Paradise City.

1:02:59.232 --> 1:03:01.765
It doesn't make the news. The
crime rate's kind of crazy.

1:03:01.832 --> 1:03:03.399
But on a local level, you know,

1:03:03.466 --> 1:03:06.166
we do have the Almighty
Street Team in Bridgeport.

1:03:06.232 --> 1:03:08.865
They're kind of vigilantes,
but they're helping their city.

1:03:08.932 --> 1:03:10.399
We've talked about vigilantes before.

1:03:10.466 --> 1:03:12.032
We're not necessarily fans of them,

1:03:12.099 --> 1:03:14.666
but the mayor and the city officials...

1:03:41.232 --> 1:03:42.765
- Let's go, boys.
- Not yet.

1:03:42.832 --> 1:03:44.865
Ray will give us the
signal when he's ready.

1:03:44.932 --> 1:03:47.433
- Chapel, man, let's just go.
- What's the signal?

1:03:47.499 --> 1:03:49.932
We'll know it when you hear it.

1:04:20.299 --> 1:04:21.999
He say how much longer we got to wait?

1:04:22.066 --> 1:04:24.199
Until you see a body fall
off that goddamn rooftop.

1:04:24.266 --> 1:04:26.765
- Hey, you guys hear that?
- Sounds like gunfire.

1:04:26.832 --> 1:04:29.466
Well, shit. It's go time, then, boys.

1:04:29.932 --> 1:04:31.799
Let's do it.

1:08:03.633 --> 1:08:05.466
I have a job for you.

1:08:07.466 --> 1:08:09.066
Finally.

1:08:13.299 --> 1:08:16.999
I'm watching my kingdom.

1:08:17.066 --> 1:08:19.732
My beautiful kingdom that I
built with my own two hands,

1:08:19.799 --> 1:08:21.399
burning down around me.

1:08:21.466 --> 1:08:24.299
When I am the one that
makes all the tough choices,

1:08:24.366 --> 1:08:26.799
I am the one that keeps the wheels turning.

1:08:26.865 --> 1:08:29.666
And do you think that he acknowledges that?

1:08:29.732 --> 1:08:31.765
Who?

1:08:33.299 --> 1:08:35.799
Never interrupt a man's monologue.

1:08:35.865 --> 1:08:36.965
I'm sorry.

1:08:37.032 --> 1:08:38.433
Where was I?

1:08:38.499 --> 1:08:39.765
That he doesn't understand...

1:08:39.832 --> 1:08:41.932
Right. He doesn't.

1:08:42.865 --> 1:08:44.865
And now I have this...

1:08:44.932 --> 1:08:47.932
this walking ghost

1:08:47.999 --> 1:08:49.765
decimating my distribution plants,

1:08:49.832 --> 1:08:51.366
killing off my men.

1:08:51.433 --> 1:08:52.999
And he is messy.

1:08:53.066 --> 1:08:55.332
Leaving a trail of bodies
that will most assuredly

1:08:55.399 --> 1:08:58.999
lead the local PD
directly to our doorsteps.

1:09:00.466 --> 1:09:03.732
Or maybe Ray Lazarus...

1:09:05.666 --> 1:09:09.366
is exactly what I need.

1:09:15.732 --> 1:09:17.266
You two,

1:09:17.332 --> 1:09:19.066
come with me.

1:09:33.366 --> 1:09:35.466
Ember.

1:09:37.199 --> 1:09:39.533
We were beginning to worry about you.

1:09:39.599 --> 1:09:40.999
Thought you were dead.

1:09:41.066 --> 1:09:43.366
I would have been if you
assholes had your way.

1:09:43.433 --> 1:09:46.266
I make one mistake and
you try to knock me off?

1:09:46.332 --> 1:09:49.366
Testament's decisions are
based on principle alone.

1:09:49.433 --> 1:09:51.832
It's scripture to him. You know that.

1:09:51.899 --> 1:09:55.132
Now a rule might be a little extreme,

1:09:55.199 --> 1:09:56.899
but they solely exist for your protection.

1:09:56.965 --> 1:09:59.032
They exist to keep us in-line and afraid.

1:09:59.099 --> 1:10:02.066
Is that why you're here? To finish the job?

1:10:02.132 --> 1:10:07.199
Dear, you're too weak to die by my hand.

1:10:08.633 --> 1:10:10.566
Your friends, however,

1:10:10.633 --> 1:10:12.433
have made quite a mess.

1:10:12.499 --> 1:10:14.132
Not very wise.

1:10:14.199 --> 1:10:16.832
Your boss brought that upon himself.

1:10:16.899 --> 1:10:19.899
Don't you get tired of being his weapon?

1:10:20.499 --> 1:10:22.499
We are what we are.

1:10:23.666 --> 1:10:25.032
My path is set.

1:10:25.099 --> 1:10:27.266
Fate already chosen.

1:10:28.166 --> 1:10:30.433
You knew this would happen.

1:10:30.499 --> 1:10:32.266
Now they're all going to die,

1:10:32.332 --> 1:10:35.099
and there's nothing to stop it.

1:10:35.166 --> 1:10:38.932
Now, where can I find them?

1:10:38.999 --> 1:10:40.700
I'm not going to tell you that.

1:10:40.765 --> 1:10:42.332
Oh, you will.

1:10:43.499 --> 1:10:47.299
Or I'll reconsider
snatching the life from you.

1:10:55.633 --> 1:10:57.633
Hello, Detective.

1:10:57.700 --> 1:10:59.932
I trust your reason for
dragging me into this shithole.

1:10:59.999 --> 1:11:01.366
Is it just one?

1:11:01.433 --> 1:11:03.066
Oh, it is.

1:11:03.132 --> 1:11:06.266
A lot of your men have been
found dead in the past week.

1:11:06.332 --> 1:11:08.566
- You know anything about that?
- I know what you know.

1:11:08.633 --> 1:11:11.965
But I'm more than willing
to help out in any way I can.

1:11:12.032 --> 1:11:13.499
Oh, is that right?

1:11:14.865 --> 1:11:16.266
Looks like the buildings that were hit

1:11:16.332 --> 1:11:18.332
were doubling as
manufacturing plants for Synth.

1:11:18.399 --> 1:11:21.332
Maybe those plants belong to you.

1:11:21.399 --> 1:11:23.066
Well, I own half this city, Detective,

1:11:23.132 --> 1:11:25.999
so I'm sure one or two
could easily be mine.

1:11:26.066 --> 1:11:29.499
But I know of no such
manufacturing of any drug.

1:11:29.566 --> 1:11:32.099
Not in my establishments.

1:11:33.999 --> 1:11:35.899
- I'm guessing that you do.
- Oh.

1:11:35.965 --> 1:11:37.533
Maybe you pissed off the wrong guy,

1:11:37.599 --> 1:11:41.066
or maybe your old crew just
wasn't cutting it enough

1:11:41.132 --> 1:11:43.799
and you decided to clean the slate.

1:11:45.032 --> 1:11:47.899
If I were killing my own men,

1:11:47.965 --> 1:11:49.932
I would be much cleaner about it.

1:11:49.999 --> 1:11:52.399
I'd cut them up into little pieces,

1:11:52.466 --> 1:11:53.799
dissolve their bodies,

1:11:53.865 --> 1:11:56.232
throw the remains into the harbor.

1:11:56.299 --> 1:12:00.765
Not leave them scattered
around like rats to a dumpster,

1:12:00.832 --> 1:12:02.099
now would I?

1:12:02.166 --> 1:12:04.533
Is that an admission of guilt?

1:12:05.466 --> 1:12:08.066
It's an admission of common sense...

1:12:09.166 --> 1:12:12.332
which is more than I
can say for your killers.

1:12:12.399 --> 1:12:14.199
Your killers? Messy.

1:12:14.266 --> 1:12:18.099
In this city, messy gets you killed.

1:12:18.166 --> 1:12:20.332
"Killers," as you say. Plural.

1:12:20.399 --> 1:12:21.633
Ha!

1:12:21.700 --> 1:12:23.232
So you know there's more than one?

1:12:23.299 --> 1:12:26.899
No living being could have
killed all those men alone

1:12:26.965 --> 1:12:29.066
and gotten away with it, now could they?

1:12:30.132 --> 1:12:32.199
Simple logic dictates
there's more than one.

1:12:32.266 --> 1:12:35.799
Look, am I being charged
with anything right now?

1:12:37.132 --> 1:12:38.865
Not now.

1:12:43.332 --> 1:12:47.399
I suggest you focus your
attention more on them

1:12:47.466 --> 1:12:49.366
before it's too late.

1:12:51.999 --> 1:12:53.865
I'll be in touch.

1:13:59.032 --> 1:14:01.099
And who are you supposed to be?

1:15:10.699 --> 1:15:13.399
- What have you got?
- Testament knows something.

1:15:13.466 --> 1:15:15.732
I doubt he's actually
responsible for the murders,

1:15:15.799 --> 1:15:18.699
but he definitely has an idea of who is.

1:15:18.765 --> 1:15:20.366
Whoever's gunning for him,

1:15:20.433 --> 1:15:22.599
they're working their
way up the food chain.

1:15:22.666 --> 1:15:24.299
You stay close to him.

1:15:24.366 --> 1:15:26.032
Will do.

1:15:29.633 --> 1:15:30.932
- Alex?
- Yeah.

1:15:30.999 --> 1:15:32.332
I just got a call.

1:15:32.399 --> 1:15:34.032
A tip from an anonymous source downtown.

1:15:34.099 --> 1:15:35.899
They're saying it's a massacre.

1:15:35.965 --> 1:15:37.965
- Rooftop full of bodies.
- Who all knows about this?

1:15:38.032 --> 1:15:40.299
- Just me.
- Okay.

1:15:40.366 --> 1:15:42.999
- Let's keep it that way until we know more.
- Got it.

1:17:28.466 --> 1:17:32.466
There's a lot of talk around
town about a man in a black suit

1:17:32.533 --> 1:17:34.865
on a motorcycle

1:17:34.932 --> 1:17:38.032
bringing down all the
drug houses in the city.

1:17:38.099 --> 1:17:40.299
Hm. Shit.

1:17:41.832 --> 1:17:44.732
Never would have guessed you were the guy.

1:17:52.199 --> 1:17:53.799
Where'd you get all of this?

1:17:53.865 --> 1:17:56.499
It's courtesy
of Poet and his runners.

1:17:57.865 --> 1:17:59.799
So, what am I supposed to do with it?

1:17:59.865 --> 1:18:01.599
Use it to keep your doors open.

1:18:01.666 --> 1:18:05.765
Offer a place of refuge to any
lost souls that come your way.

1:18:06.599 --> 1:18:07.899
Taking from the rich assholes

1:18:07.965 --> 1:18:10.332
and giving it to the disenfranchised.

1:18:10.399 --> 1:18:12.799
Hm. I can dig it.

1:18:15.499 --> 1:18:17.799
Listen, man, I'm not going
to sit here and pretend

1:18:17.865 --> 1:18:20.199
like I understand why
you're doing what you do.

1:18:20.266 --> 1:18:22.832
But it's nice to know
that someone's out there

1:18:22.899 --> 1:18:24.199
fighting for us.

1:18:24.266 --> 1:18:26.066
Look, man, do me a favor.

1:18:26.132 --> 1:18:28.032
You watch your ass while you're out there.

1:18:28.099 --> 1:18:30.433
- Pulse.
- You know what I mean.

1:18:30.899 --> 1:18:32.366
Be careful.

1:18:32.433 --> 1:18:35.332
I made your
father a promise, Twitch.

1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:38.832
I plan on keeping it.

1:19:11.566 --> 1:19:13.865
Well done, boys.

1:19:15.099 --> 1:19:16.965
I'm sure he got the message.

1:19:18.299 --> 1:19:20.299
This amuses you?

1:19:20.366 --> 1:19:23.266
I've just learned that the
last of my distribution plants

1:19:23.332 --> 1:19:24.899
has fallen.

1:19:24.965 --> 1:19:27.732
This time Lazarus wasn't alone.

1:19:28.199 --> 1:19:29.899
He had help.

1:19:30.599 --> 1:19:32.799
Soldiers, no less.

1:19:33.965 --> 1:19:36.199
This vendetta

1:19:36.266 --> 1:19:38.633
has become a fucking crusade,

1:19:38.699 --> 1:19:40.633
and you seem to be completely

1:19:40.700 --> 1:19:43.299
unaffected by it.

1:19:43.366 --> 1:19:45.965
Our pipeline is dead.

1:19:46.032 --> 1:19:48.799
Production of Synth is no longer possible.

1:19:48.865 --> 1:19:50.732
And if you

1:19:50.799 --> 1:19:53.499
are not willing to do anything

1:19:53.566 --> 1:19:55.299
to remedy the situation,

1:19:55.366 --> 1:19:56.399
I will.

1:19:56.466 --> 1:20:00.266
You dare pretend to make decisions for me?

1:20:00.799 --> 1:20:02.799
This is my city.

1:20:04.366 --> 1:20:06.732
Oh, you have power?

1:20:07.899 --> 1:20:10.332
You've got power because
I placed it in your hands.

1:20:10.399 --> 1:20:13.399
And that power can be taken away.

1:20:15.633 --> 1:20:17.832
You interfere,

1:20:17.899 --> 1:20:19.466
you will lose.

1:20:20.965 --> 1:20:23.166
You won't win.

1:20:23.232 --> 1:20:25.633
As we speak,

1:20:25.699 --> 1:20:28.499
Endless is hunting them down.

1:20:29.965 --> 1:20:32.865
And he will bring back

1:20:32.932 --> 1:20:35.099
what's left of Lazarus's body to me.

1:20:39.332 --> 1:20:40.899
No.

1:20:42.999 --> 1:20:44.799
Your delusions will find you buried

1:20:44.865 --> 1:20:48.399
along with that so-called army of yours.

1:20:49.533 --> 1:20:52.865
And any hopes you had
of saving your family.

1:20:52.932 --> 1:20:55.732
All of your men

1:20:55.799 --> 1:20:58.799
will die tonight.

1:20:58.865 --> 1:21:02.332
But my men will not be among them.

1:21:03.566 --> 1:21:05.499
For when plans,

1:21:05.566 --> 1:21:07.732
the future,

1:21:07.799 --> 1:21:10.732
life is in doubt...

1:21:12.099 --> 1:21:15.732
a poet gives testament to three words:

1:21:16.433 --> 1:21:20.965
"I am out."

1:22:24.332 --> 1:22:26.032
All right.

1:22:26.899 --> 1:22:28.433
Come on. That's it.

1:23:30.066 --> 1:23:33.899
It's impolite to enter someone's
home without saying hello.

1:23:34.799 --> 1:23:37.299
Even for a ghost.

1:23:37.366 --> 1:23:40.732
I am fascinated you can see me, dear.

1:23:40.799 --> 1:23:43.899
Such a gift. However did you acquire it?

1:23:44.765 --> 1:23:46.266
What exactly do you want from me?

1:23:46.332 --> 1:23:48.699
I've done everything you've asked.

1:23:48.765 --> 1:23:50.466
Soon you'll have your weapon,

1:23:50.533 --> 1:23:52.832
and then you can reveal your secrets to me.

1:23:52.899 --> 1:23:54.865
I keep my word.

1:23:54.932 --> 1:23:57.466
All of our knowledge
and history will be yours

1:23:57.533 --> 1:24:00.332
in exchange for help securing the other.

1:24:01.199 --> 1:24:03.332
Why is he so important to you?

1:24:04.566 --> 1:24:07.032
In due time you'll have
the answers you seek.

1:24:07.099 --> 1:24:09.666
Until then, I keep my secrets.

1:24:09.732 --> 1:24:11.332
I just find it very unsettling

1:24:11.399 --> 1:24:14.466
that you would want such an
evil man to have so much power.

1:24:14.533 --> 1:24:18.266
It's not about good and
evil. It's about balance.

1:24:19.433 --> 1:24:23.633
There will never be
balance. Not in this world.

1:24:23.699 --> 1:24:25.366
It's too chaotic.

1:24:32.765 --> 1:24:34.366
We'll see.

1:24:36.166 --> 1:24:37.499
Mike!

1:24:42.799 --> 1:24:44.232
Ray.

1:24:45.132 --> 1:24:47.232
Ray. So that's you, right?

1:24:48.666 --> 1:24:50.199
I got him.

1:24:50.965 --> 1:24:52.499
I got him good.

1:24:53.732 --> 1:24:55.366
I know I hurt him.

1:24:55.433 --> 1:24:57.332
You did good, old man.

1:24:59.899 --> 1:25:01.799
You softened him up for me.

1:25:01.865 --> 1:25:04.099
Brought honor to us tonight.

1:25:04.832 --> 1:25:06.399
My brothers...

1:25:08.032 --> 1:25:10.433
we always were faithful.

1:25:11.699 --> 1:25:13.399
Always faithful.

1:25:13.466 --> 1:25:15.466
You avenged your brothers.

1:25:16.699 --> 1:25:18.332
Your family.

1:25:20.699 --> 1:25:22.332
Family.

1:25:25.599 --> 1:25:27.332
Carol.

1:25:31.699 --> 1:25:33.332
Mike?

1:25:35.566 --> 1:25:37.399
Mike!

1:26:45.832 --> 1:26:48.865
Lazarus, right?

1:26:50.232 --> 1:26:52.599
You look dressed for the occasion.

1:26:52.666 --> 1:26:54.366
So am I.

1:26:54.433 --> 1:26:55.566
You...

1:26:55.633 --> 1:26:58.299
took the lives of my friends.

1:26:59.166 --> 1:27:01.965
And now I'm going to take yours.

1:27:02.032 --> 1:27:04.066
Oh, I expect you to try.

1:27:04.132 --> 1:27:07.732
Before, you were weak,

1:27:07.799 --> 1:27:09.332
like the rest of this city.

1:27:09.399 --> 1:27:11.266
A lamb to the slaughter.

1:27:12.499 --> 1:27:13.932
Look what you've become.

1:27:13.999 --> 1:27:17.366
You're a killer now. Just like me.

1:27:17.433 --> 1:27:19.433
Only difference is,

1:27:19.499 --> 1:27:21.832
I embrace what I am.

1:27:23.266 --> 1:27:24.499
You do not.

1:27:24.566 --> 1:27:26.633
I fight for the innocent.

1:27:26.699 --> 1:27:28.865
To free them from men like you.

1:27:28.932 --> 1:27:32.132
Don't confuse vengeance with heroics.

1:27:33.466 --> 1:27:36.499
You think putting on a suit
and a mask makes you a hero?

1:27:36.566 --> 1:27:38.232
Oh, I'm no hero.

1:27:38.299 --> 1:27:41.332
But I'm strong enough to kill you.

1:28:16.232 --> 1:28:19.899
Now I know everything you know,

1:28:19.965 --> 1:28:21.865
including where your boss is hiding.

1:28:21.932 --> 1:28:24.732
I can tell.

1:28:26.332 --> 1:28:28.799
I'm your power.

1:31:57.932 --> 1:32:00.032
You can't run from me.

1:32:01.566 --> 1:32:03.099
Run?

1:32:03.899 --> 1:32:05.765
Oh, I'm not running.

1:33:21.399 --> 1:33:23.699
May as you well

1:33:23.765 --> 1:33:25.999
save my sister's life.

1:33:48.199 --> 1:33:50.399
What are you doing?

1:33:51.566 --> 1:33:53.232
He's half past dead already.

1:33:53.299 --> 1:33:56.166
Just take what's left of
his life and be done with it.

1:33:56.232 --> 1:33:57.765
No.

1:33:58.433 --> 1:33:59.965
No?

1:34:01.232 --> 1:34:04.132
Do you know how long
I've been working on this?

1:34:05.433 --> 1:34:08.433
You think power of this
magnitude comes without cost?

1:34:08.499 --> 1:34:10.099
You had me killed.

1:34:13.932 --> 1:34:15.765
Yeah.

1:34:18.899 --> 1:34:22.899
Death was a small price to pay
for the power you now possess.

1:34:26.266 --> 1:34:27.832
You see, the problem with you, Ray,

1:34:27.899 --> 1:34:31.132
is you can't see past your own pain.

1:34:33.332 --> 1:34:35.066
This is bigger than Ray.

1:34:36.732 --> 1:34:38.832
The unity of opposites.

1:34:39.899 --> 1:34:43.032
In every generation
there's always been two.

1:34:43.799 --> 1:34:46.299
It's how we maintain balance.

1:34:47.466 --> 1:34:49.765
And besides, what's a
few insignificant deaths

1:34:49.832 --> 1:34:51.533
along the way compared to millions?

1:34:51.599 --> 1:34:53.732
Not insignificant.

1:34:54.566 --> 1:34:56.266
Not to me.

1:34:58.765 --> 1:35:00.832
I'm done killing for you.

1:35:01.732 --> 1:35:03.499
You want him dead,

1:35:04.099 --> 1:35:05.799
finish him yourself.

1:35:16.266 --> 1:35:19.066
Ray. Ray!

1:35:19.399 --> 1:35:20.466
Ray.

1:35:20.533 --> 1:35:21.999
You just can't walk away, man.

1:35:22.066 --> 1:35:23.232
Ray!

1:35:23.899 --> 1:35:25.865
Come back here, Ray!

1:35:40.932 --> 1:35:43.199
Interesting outfit, Ray.

1:35:43.266 --> 1:35:45.199
I assume it's fitted with Kevlar,

1:35:45.266 --> 1:35:47.865
which explains why you're still alive.

1:35:47.932 --> 1:35:50.533
- Right.
- Unfortunately for you,

1:35:50.599 --> 1:35:51.965
these rounds are high velocity,

1:35:52.032 --> 1:35:53.865
which means if fired from this distance,

1:35:53.932 --> 1:35:55.666
you're dead.

1:35:55.732 --> 1:35:58.166
Don't move. I'm tired.

1:36:01.799 --> 1:36:04.232
These men were murderers and dealers.

1:36:04.299 --> 1:36:06.533
They killed hundreds of innocent people.

1:36:06.599 --> 1:36:07.932
Poisoned the entire city.

1:36:07.999 --> 1:36:09.865
Took people I care about.

1:36:09.932 --> 1:36:13.566
I didn't choose this path. It chose me.

1:36:14.765 --> 1:36:17.132
I'm just doing what needs
to be done, just like you.

1:36:17.199 --> 1:36:19.199
Moments from now, dozens
of uniformed officers

1:36:19.266 --> 1:36:21.466
are going to swarm on this compound

1:36:21.533 --> 1:36:23.566
and arrest anyone who's still left alive.

1:36:23.633 --> 1:36:25.032
Including you.

1:36:26.466 --> 1:36:27.999
So...

1:36:29.399 --> 1:36:31.132
I'm giving you till dawn.

1:36:31.932 --> 1:36:34.066
Then I'm coming for you.

1:37:03.666 --> 1:37:05.865
In the end,

1:37:05.932 --> 1:37:08.466
we were all fighting for the same reasons:

1:37:10.666 --> 1:37:12.299
to save the soul of this city.

1:37:15.699 --> 1:37:17.499
Old enemies fall.

1:37:17.566 --> 1:37:19.366
New ones rise.

1:37:22.032 --> 1:37:25.032
But fate has a plan.

1:37:26.399 --> 1:37:28.266
And I'm not alone.

1:37:29.032 --> 1:37:31.266
There are others out there like me

1:37:31.332 --> 1:37:34.799
who believe as I do that
we can turn the tide.

1:37:37.132 --> 1:37:38.166
This...

1:37:39.633 --> 1:37:41.166
was only the beginning.

1:38:07.466 --> 1:38:08.499
Iden.

1:38:10.932 --> 1:38:13.066
That's your real name, isn't it?

1:38:15.166 --> 1:38:19.499
You and I have a great
deal to discuss, my friend.

1:38:45.899 --> 1:38:47.765
Mike? And the others?

1:39:23.533 --> 1:39:24.999
Benjamin.

1:39:25.066 --> 1:39:26.566
I been waiting here for you for hours.

1:39:26.633 --> 1:39:28.299
- What is it?
- I know who's been

1:39:28.366 --> 1:39:31.832
committing those murders,
and I think I know why.

1:39:31.899 --> 1:39:33.965
I think I know who this man is.

1:39:34.032 --> 1:39:35.299
And I know where to find him.

1:39:35.366 --> 1:39:37.566
He's not a man.

1:39:37.633 --> 1:39:39.366
Not anymore.

1:40:36.633 --> 1:40:38.199
Marcus!

1:40:38.266 --> 1:40:40.732
- Yo!
- Hey, what's up?

1:40:40.799 --> 1:40:43.032
What's going on?

1:40:43.099 --> 1:40:45.332
Me and the homies headed downtown.

1:40:45.399 --> 1:40:48.899
Some rich dude named Poet's
throwing a party. Want to roll?

1:40:52.032 --> 1:40:54.499
- Come on.
- Nah, I got to study.

1:40:54.566 --> 1:40:55.732
Oh, come on.

1:40:55.799 --> 1:40:57.032
You get straight A's, bro.

1:40:57.099 --> 1:40:58.932
You can afford to take a night off.

1:40:58.999 --> 1:41:01.832
No, man, I can't. My folks would kill me.

1:41:02.666 --> 1:41:04.332
I'm going to just head home.

1:41:06.932 --> 1:41:08.732
Cool, man. Later.

1:41:08.799 --> 1:41:10.166
Y'all be safe.

1:41:10.232 --> 1:41:11.765
You too, man.
