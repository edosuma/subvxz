00:02.844 --> 00:04.346
Good.
(cymbal crashes)

00:04.346 --> 00:05.721
(Rachel laughs)

00:05.723 --> 00:09.309
Okay, everybody,
let's hear it for love!

00:09.310 --> 00:10.894
Your assignment
for Valentine's week

00:10.895 --> 00:15.482
is to find and perform
the world's greatest love songs.

00:15.483 --> 00:16.775
Now, Regionals
is next week,

00:16.776 --> 00:18.286
and we still need to raise

00:18.287 --> 00:20.987
$250 for costumes
and hair spray.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.531
Oh, God, not another bake sale.

00:22.532 --> 00:23.490
WILL:
If any student gives

00:23.491 --> 00:25.242
ten dollars, we will sing these

00:25.243 --> 00:26.910
"world's greatest love songs"
to their Valentine.

00:26.911 --> 00:28.620
We will serenade
each classroom...

00:28.621 --> 00:30.414
- STUDENTS: No!
- Yes!

00:30.415 --> 00:32.999
Two years ago, we went
room-to-room Christmas caroling,

00:33.000 --> 00:33.959
they threw food.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.336
And shoes.
Yes, Sugar?

00:35.337 --> 00:37.872
Here's a spoonful of Sugar
for you all:

00:37.873 --> 00:40.007
Don't sweat the small stuff,

00:40.008 --> 00:42.551
and it's all small stuff
when you're rich.

00:42.552 --> 00:44.052
So, here you go.

00:44.053 --> 00:46.304
Uh, Sugar,
I can't take that.

00:46.305 --> 00:47.889
Take it!

00:48.350 --> 00:49.567
Okay.

00:49.568 --> 00:51.393
Everyone, give it up
for Sugar for paying for

00:51.394 --> 00:52.436
our FinalNet
and cumberbunds!

00:52.437 --> 00:53.768
SUGAR: I love
the sound of applause,

00:53.769 --> 00:55.814
even if I have to buy it.

00:55.815 --> 00:59.192
Okay, everyone, look
under your chairs.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.527
Except you, Artie.

01:00.528 --> 01:01.903
Your chair kept moving, so I hid

01:01.904 --> 01:03.344
your surprise
in the wastebasket.

01:06.682 --> 01:08.869
I found mine ten minutes ago.

01:08.870 --> 01:10.037
V-Day is my
fave day ever.

01:10.038 --> 01:11.580
And to help me
celebrate, my daddy's

01:11.581 --> 01:14.499
throwing me a huge, ridic party
at Breadstix.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.917
And I'm naming it

01:15.918 --> 01:17.141
the Sugar Shack.

01:17.142 --> 01:19.527
And... drumroll, Rachel...

01:21.047 --> 01:22.174
... you're all invited!

01:22.175 --> 01:24.050
(Students cheer)

01:24.051 --> 01:26.094
But you have to bring a date.

01:26.095 --> 01:27.971
No single people allowed.

01:27.972 --> 01:32.476
They're sad and boring and
they don't exist in my world.

01:32.477 --> 01:34.325
Um, but you're single.

01:34.326 --> 01:35.860
Not for long.

01:37.688 --> 01:39.191
(Giggles)

01:45.112 --> 01:47.305
Wait, what are
you doing here?

01:47.306 --> 01:49.707
I got a note that says "Come to
the auditorium now. It's urgent."

01:49.708 --> 01:51.709
Love, Mandy Patinkin."
Yeah, so did I.

01:51.710 --> 01:53.997

02:05.908 --> 02:07.469
Thanks, guys.
Thank you, thank you.

02:07.470 --> 02:08.595
LeRoy, we agreed
to sing it straight...

02:08.596 --> 02:10.277
no vocal runs.

02:10.279 --> 02:12.330
That's how Jennifer Hudson
got kicked off of <i>American Idol.</i>

02:12.331 --> 02:14.332
I would love to hear you
sing something straight.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.311
Dads, what are
you doing here?

02:16.312 --> 02:19.064
Well, a little birdie named
Burt, who owns a tire store,

02:19.065 --> 02:20.482
and his little birdie wife,

02:20.483 --> 02:22.734
who used to wear a lot of denim,
told us

02:22.735 --> 02:26.410
that you guys were, uh,
fixin' to get hitched.

02:26.411 --> 02:28.073
So we thought we'd
return the favor

02:28.074 --> 02:30.200
and surprise you.

02:30.201 --> 02:31.284
Mr. and Mr. Berry,

02:31.285 --> 02:33.050
I am so sorry.

02:33.051 --> 02:34.412
It's only customary to ask

02:34.413 --> 02:35.455
the bride's father
first, but...

02:36.080 --> 02:37.588
We wanted to say...

02:37.589 --> 02:38.875
congratulations!

02:38.876 --> 02:41.692
And what better place
than on the very stage

02:41.693 --> 02:43.630
on which you shared
your first kiss?

02:43.631 --> 02:44.798
So you're not angry?

02:44.799 --> 02:46.230
Not at you.

02:46.231 --> 02:47.732
I'm angry 'cause
evidently your father

02:47.733 --> 02:49.427
has been having
recurring dreams

02:49.428 --> 02:51.638
about Hollywood heartthrob
Tony Danza.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.348
One dream.
I had one dream

02:53.349 --> 02:56.518
that Tony Danza and I
went ice fishing, okay?

02:56.519 --> 02:59.396
We know you two
really love each other.

02:59.397 --> 03:01.147
And if you're
really sure

03:01.148 --> 03:03.233
you want to spend
the rest of

03:03.234 --> 03:05.193
your lives together,
the last thing

03:05.194 --> 03:06.528
we want to do
is stand in your way.

03:06.529 --> 03:07.988
No, we wouldn't do that.

03:07.989 --> 03:10.972
I mean, marrying
in your teens usually,

03:10.973 --> 03:14.077
you know, doubles the likelihood
of divorce...

03:14.078 --> 03:15.954
a fate that befell
Liza and Barbra...

03:15.955 --> 03:17.728
Are you really going to do this
right now?

03:17.729 --> 03:20.348
Oh, why, you know who else
got, uh, just got divorced?

03:20.349 --> 03:22.794
Tony Danza!
Yeah, did you hear that, LeRoy?

03:22.795 --> 03:25.171
Oh! Yeah, he's single now.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.299
Why don't you fire
up those snowmobiles

03:27.300 --> 03:28.689
and give him a call?

03:28.690 --> 03:30.274
It's ice fishing season.

03:30.275 --> 03:31.887
What your dad
is trying to say

03:31.888 --> 03:33.763
is that he's very excited

03:33.764 --> 03:37.114
to start planning
his only daughter's wedding.

03:37.115 --> 03:38.666
I'm so excited, yeah.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.437
But, uh, we are using
the square tables.

03:40.438 --> 03:41.819
Well, we want to start

03:41.820 --> 03:45.609
with a Valentine's Day dinner
at our house

03:45.610 --> 03:47.041
with the Hudson-Hummels.

03:47.042 --> 03:48.626
We're going to be
one big family, so...

03:48.627 --> 03:49.863
let's make a milestone
out of it.

03:49.864 --> 03:51.662
You were raised to be proud

03:51.663 --> 03:53.097
of the decisions that you make.

03:53.098 --> 03:55.744
And if this is what
you really want, sweetie,

03:55.745 --> 04:01.472
well, then you need to start
shouting it from the rooftops!

04:01.473 --> 04:02.640
(Vocalizing)

04:02.641 --> 04:03.627
♪ Yeah!

04:03.628 --> 04:05.009
I love you both so much.

04:05.010 --> 04:06.694
Ah, yeah.
(chuckles)

04:14.720 --> 04:16.096
(school bell ringing)

04:16.098 --> 04:18.600
I now call this meeting
of the God Squad to order.

04:18.601 --> 04:19.874
Thank you guys
for coming.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.158
Our first order
of business is

04:21.159 --> 04:22.979
to welcome Quinn Fabray back
into the fold.

04:22.980 --> 04:24.628
It's nice to
see you, Quinn.

04:24.629 --> 04:25.899
Thank you.
I know it's been a while.

04:25.900 --> 04:27.025
When I was at my lowest,

04:27.026 --> 04:28.985
I turned to prayer.

04:28.986 --> 04:31.947
Not even sure who I was
praying to, really,

04:31.948 --> 04:33.788
but it seemed to lead me
on the right track.

04:33.789 --> 04:35.089
Amen.
Praise.

04:36.033 --> 04:37.224
Can I ask a question?

04:37.225 --> 04:38.036
What's with tarantula head
over here?

04:38.037 --> 04:39.537
This is our new member.

04:39.538 --> 04:41.957
This is Joseph Hart,
but you guys can call him Joe.

04:41.958 --> 04:43.583
He just transferred
here to McKinley.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.816
Yeah, I guess I'm a sophomore.
I've been homeschooled

04:45.817 --> 04:47.351
my whole life,
but this past year I realized

04:47.352 --> 04:48.296
my best friend
was my mom,

04:48.297 --> 04:50.237
so I decided I wanted to get out

04:50.238 --> 04:51.800
and experience the world.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.135
MERCEDES (whispers):
<i>Joseph.</i>

04:54.136 --> 04:55.893
What's with the tats?
Bible quotes.

04:55.894 --> 04:58.098
And each one of my dreads is
named after a book of the Bible.

04:58.099 --> 04:59.641
You have got to be kidding me.

04:59.642 --> 05:01.999
I play guitar, too,
but I only know Christian stuff.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.604
My dad only listens to talk
radio, and we don't have a TV.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.837
You guys mind
if I take off my shoes?

05:06.838 --> 05:08.650
I'm sort of used to
going to school barefoot.

05:08.651 --> 05:10.986
I'm just glad there's another
dude around here.

05:10.987 --> 05:12.028
I notice that Shane

05:12.029 --> 05:13.761
isn't a member of the God Squad.

05:14.905 --> 05:17.409
- That's interesting.
- Okay, that's enough, Sam.

05:17.410 --> 05:18.516
All right, so
our last meeting

05:18.517 --> 05:19.834
we talked about opportunities

05:19.835 --> 05:21.079
for community service.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.206
Uh, Valentine's Day's
right around the corner,

05:23.207 --> 05:25.139
and since the Glee Club
turned it down,

05:25.140 --> 05:27.294
there's an open slot
for singing telegrams.

05:27.295 --> 05:28.461
All four of us sing,

05:28.462 --> 05:30.027
and Teen Jesus
and I play guitar,

05:30.028 --> 05:31.673
so I thought we could
use the money to

05:31.674 --> 05:33.216
adopt a highway
and start a shoe drive.

05:33.217 --> 05:34.342
Praise.

05:34.343 --> 05:36.283
It is a religious holiday...
St. Valentine's and all that.

05:36.284 --> 05:38.736
And I'd love to show this school
that it's cool to be Christian.

05:38.737 --> 05:39.639
We aren't all
just door-to-door

05:39.640 --> 05:41.349
Bible salesmen, like my dad.

05:41.350 --> 05:42.790
All right, all in favor?

05:45.895 --> 05:47.294
(School bell ringing)
Righteous.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.784
Wait, which one are you gonna
take to Sugar's V-Day party?

05:53.785 --> 05:55.447
All of them.

05:55.448 --> 05:56.865
The entire sorority?

05:56.866 --> 05:58.589
They don't call them
the "E-Z-Dee-Zees" for nothing.

05:58.590 --> 06:00.758
I got the gig cleaning the
sorority house swimming pool,

06:00.759 --> 06:02.292
then I sawed through
those chicks

06:02.293 --> 06:03.677
like a freakin'
sex tornado...

06:03.678 --> 06:05.415
room to room.
You're amazing.

06:05.416 --> 06:07.398
I'm a professional.

06:07.399 --> 06:08.799
Tried the true love thing...

06:08.800 --> 06:10.462
With a teacher.
(chuckles)

06:10.463 --> 06:12.770
- Wasn't for me.
- Well, it is for me.

06:12.771 --> 06:14.522
And apparently it's
for Blaine, too.

06:14.523 --> 06:17.274
Look: even from his sick
bed, he's managed to send me

06:17.275 --> 06:19.743
a new Valentine's Day card
every single day this week.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.614
It says
"From your secret admirer."

06:23.615 --> 06:25.018
(sighs)
So romantic.

06:25.019 --> 06:26.394
Oh.

06:26.395 --> 06:27.937
Ooh.

06:27.938 --> 06:29.670
A gorilla gram?

06:29.671 --> 06:30.690
<i>Pour moi?</i>

06:30.691 --> 06:31.789
(chuckles)

06:31.790 --> 06:32.790
"To Kurt.

06:32.791 --> 06:33.818
From your secret admirer."

06:33.819 --> 06:35.492
Again.

06:35.493 --> 06:37.113
Well, I wonder
who it could be.

06:37.114 --> 06:38.740
Will you tell me who it is,
Valentine gorilla?

06:42.952 --> 06:45.413
You see, Puckerman, that's
what you're missing out on:

06:45.414 --> 06:46.664
True love.

06:47.498 --> 06:48.639
What about you, Rory?

06:48.640 --> 06:49.690
Who are you taking
to Sugar's party?

06:49.691 --> 06:50.627
Sugar.

06:50.628 --> 06:52.059
Hold up.

06:52.060 --> 06:53.671
You better have an option "B"
because I'm all over that.

06:53.672 --> 06:54.964
You're going with Sugar?

06:54.965 --> 06:56.257
As soon as I ask her out,

06:56.258 --> 06:57.842
and she says yes,
which I'm sure she will

06:57.843 --> 07:00.637
because... I don't mean this
to sound mean, Irish...

07:00.638 --> 07:01.952
but nobody understands
anything you say.

07:01.953 --> 07:03.515
Baloney.
Chicks dig accents.

07:03.516 --> 07:05.406
I'm sorry, what was that?
Couldn't quite make it out.

07:05.407 --> 07:06.490
PUCK: Fellas, there's
no need to fight.

07:06.491 --> 07:07.875
You can just pick up the girls

07:07.876 --> 07:08.978
that fall off
old Puckerosaurus here.

07:08.979 --> 07:12.107
This is a four-leaf clover, kid.

07:12.108 --> 07:13.380
'Cause you're going to need

07:13.381 --> 07:14.651
all the luck you can get.

07:14.652 --> 07:16.550
Do you people
just carry those around?

09:21.662 --> 09:23.780
You're giving me your
computer for Valentine's Day?

09:23.781 --> 09:25.148
It's a playlist.

09:25.149 --> 09:27.317
With all the songs
that I hear in my head

09:27.318 --> 09:29.285
when I'm with you
or when I'm thinking about you.

09:29.286 --> 09:30.995
I wanted to make you a CD
for Valentine's Day,

09:30.996 --> 09:34.874
but this is as far
as I got without any help, so...

09:34.875 --> 09:37.344
Oh, and I made you a cover.

09:39.086 --> 09:40.088
Brittany.

09:41.630 --> 09:43.132
Thank you.

09:43.133 --> 09:44.634
You're welcome.

09:44.635 --> 09:45.760
(Giggles)

09:50.139 --> 09:52.642
Teen lesbians!

09:52.643 --> 09:54.435
I must see you

09:54.436 --> 09:57.188
in my office, right now.

09:57.189 --> 09:58.565
This is such bull crap!

09:58.566 --> 10:00.400
Why can't Brittany and I
kiss in public?

10:00.401 --> 10:01.442
'Cause we're two girls?

10:01.443 --> 10:02.869
Please don't make this about

10:02.870 --> 10:04.153
your sapphic orientation.

10:04.154 --> 10:06.406
This is about
public displays of affection.

10:06.407 --> 10:08.283
PDA simply has no place

10:08.284 --> 10:10.493
in the sacred halls
of McKinley High.

10:10.494 --> 10:12.120
We've had complaints.

10:12.121 --> 10:13.580
About us? When?

10:13.581 --> 10:15.290
Most recently...

10:15.291 --> 10:18.001
yesterday, 12:16 p.m.

10:19.585 --> 10:20.837
That?

10:20.838 --> 10:23.047
Our lips barely
even grazed.

10:23.048 --> 10:25.208
And by the way, did you get
any complaints about

10:25.209 --> 10:27.477
that hideous display
that started at 12:17 p.m.

10:27.478 --> 10:30.096
and lasted for several
uncomfortable minutes?

10:33.390 --> 10:35.769
Believe me, I'd much rather
see you and Santana kiss

10:35.770 --> 10:37.070
than that so-called Finchel,

10:37.071 --> 10:39.230
but if a student
files a complaint

10:39.231 --> 10:41.724
- because, for religious reasons...
- Oh. Great.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.360
So it was some Bible-thumper
that complained.

10:43.361 --> 10:45.445
Ms. Lopez, I'm sorry,
but I'm trying

10:45.446 --> 10:48.448
to keep this school from turning
into a volatile powder keg.

10:48.449 --> 10:50.200
I'm sorry, too.

10:50.201 --> 10:52.536
'Cause all I want to be able
to do is kiss my girlfriend,

10:52.537 --> 10:54.538
but I guess no one can see that
because there's such

10:54.539 --> 10:57.123
an insane double standard
at this school.

10:59.293 --> 11:01.085
(School bell rings)

11:03.214 --> 11:06.507
(whistling jauntily)

11:07.132 --> 11:09.135
Artie, four wheels
on the floor, please.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.554
Rachel, you had an announcement?

11:10.555 --> 11:11.888
Yeah, actually, Finn and
I have an announcement

11:12.429 --> 11:13.523
we'd like to make.

11:13.524 --> 11:17.027
Finn and I are
proud to announce...

11:17.028 --> 11:18.111
that we're finally
getting married.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.880
What?
Wow!

11:20.881 --> 11:22.816
When's the baby's due date?

11:22.817 --> 11:24.150
Wait, guys, have you both
carefully thought this through?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.269
Yes. And our parents
are totally behind us.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.454
And your plan to stop us
by telling them

11:27.455 --> 11:29.573
totally backfired, Mr. Shue.

11:29.574 --> 11:31.774
Actually, I'm the one
who told them.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.376
Because I think you guys
are making a mistake.

11:33.377 --> 11:35.412
A huge mistake.

11:35.413 --> 11:37.297
- When's the wedding?
- The date is TBD,

11:37.298 --> 11:38.781
but I can assure
all of you that

11:38.782 --> 11:39.949
we're gonna have a very simple
and elegant ceremony

11:39.950 --> 11:41.051
at the Justice of the Peace,

11:41.052 --> 11:42.627
which all of you
are invited to.

11:42.628 --> 11:44.220
And we're registered
at Samuel French.

11:44.221 --> 11:45.622
You guys aren't mature enough

11:45.623 --> 11:47.256
or old enough to properly

11:47.257 --> 11:48.966
face this type
of commitment.

11:48.967 --> 11:51.427
If you don't support us,
then I feel sorry for you,

11:51.428 --> 11:52.929
and you're not invited
to the wedding.

11:52.930 --> 11:54.931
Which makes me really sad,
because I would have loved

11:54.932 --> 11:56.182
to have seen you in
a bridesmaid's dress, Quinn.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.392
And you as well, Kurt.

11:58.141 --> 11:59.936
I'd be happy
to be a bridesmaid, Rachel.

11:59.937 --> 12:01.187
I'm not sure I'm ready
to get married,

12:01.188 --> 12:03.073
but I do know what being
in love feels like.

12:03.074 --> 12:05.575
- We'll be there.
- Thanks, guys.

12:05.576 --> 12:07.977
And we hope the rest of
you all change your minds,

12:07.978 --> 12:10.405
because it would mean a lot
to us if you were all there.

12:10.406 --> 12:12.449
Well, add me to the list
of people who are wishing

12:12.450 --> 12:14.317
you guys the best
in your marriage.

12:14.318 --> 12:16.494
However, let's stop
the fighting

12:16.495 --> 12:18.088
and remind ourselves that

12:18.089 --> 12:19.747
Valentine's Day
is rapidly approaching.

12:19.748 --> 12:21.874
So if you'll
excuse me.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.710
- (Quietly): If you'll excuse me.
- Yeah. Sorry.

12:24.711 --> 12:25.962
ARTIE:
Congrats, though.

12:25.963 --> 12:28.506
I got some sugary sweet
game to spit.

12:28.507 --> 12:30.383
Give me a beat, Finn.

This song reminds me
of you guys and...

18:00.979 --> 18:02.214
how much I've
grown to love

18:02.215 --> 18:04.648
each and every
single one of you,

18:04.649 --> 18:06.767
and how thankful I am
that you've made a place,

18:06.768 --> 18:08.869
3,000 miles
away from Ireland,

18:08.870 --> 18:09.972
feel like home.

than I do for Artie.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.697
Will you be my date
for Valentine's Day?

20:31.698 --> 20:33.597
It would be an honor.

20:34.866 --> 20:36.583
(School bell rings)

20:38.353 --> 20:39.353
All right, guys.

20:39.354 --> 20:40.888
We have to have a discussion

20:40.889 --> 20:42.472
and figure out
what the God Squad feels

20:42.473 --> 20:44.024
about singing to gay people.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.525
Well, three of us
are in Glee Club,

20:45.526 --> 20:47.895
so we're pretty much sing
to gay people all the time.

20:47.896 --> 20:50.591
I know we're okay with it,
but Joe may not be.

20:50.592 --> 20:52.032
I try my best not
to judge anybody.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.568
But, honestly, I've never met
anyone who's gay.

20:54.569 --> 20:56.221
Oh, I guarantee you have.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.488
Yeah, they say that one out of
every ten people are gay.

20:58.489 --> 21:00.226
And if that's true, that means
one of the 12 apostles

21:00.227 --> 21:01.742
might have been gay.

21:01.743 --> 21:04.912
And my guess is Simon because
that name's the gayest.

21:04.913 --> 21:06.413
The Bible says it's

21:06.414 --> 21:08.048
an abomination for a man
to lay down with another man,

21:08.049 --> 21:09.950
but we shared tents
in Cub Scouts

21:10.360 --> 21:13.286
and slept next
to each other all the time...

21:13.287 --> 21:14.922
so that would make
Cub Scouts an abomination?

21:14.923 --> 21:17.174
Do you know what else the Bible
says is an abomination?

21:17.175 --> 21:18.558
Eating lobster,

21:18.559 --> 21:20.126
planting different crops
in the same field,

21:20.127 --> 21:21.728
giving somebody a proud look.

21:21.729 --> 21:23.847
Not an abomination? Slavery.

21:23.848 --> 21:25.599
Jesus never said
anything about gay people.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.650
That's a fact.

21:26.651 --> 21:28.101
Well, maybe he wanted to,

21:28.102 --> 21:29.653
but he didn't want
to hurt Simon's feelings.

21:29.654 --> 21:31.805
You guys, we have to figure out
where we stand.

21:31.806 --> 21:33.941
Especially, if we're gonna be
asking volunteers

21:33.942 --> 21:36.309
from my church
to sing backup for us.

21:36.310 --> 21:38.812
I don't want
to hurt Santana's feelings,

21:38.813 --> 21:40.163
but I also don't
want to make someone

21:40.164 --> 21:42.582
do something they're not
comfortable with.

21:42.583 --> 21:43.584
So where do you stand, Joe?

21:44.852 --> 21:47.481
I guess I've gotta
think about it.

21:47.482 --> 21:49.256
You know what?
That's totally fair.

21:49.257 --> 21:51.658
You have to look at
the hard topics and dilemmas

21:51.659 --> 21:53.821
and be honest and truthful.

21:53.822 --> 21:55.698
If you ask me...

21:55.699 --> 21:57.681
that's what being
Christian is really about.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.101
(School bell rings)

22:02.720 --> 22:04.039
I know it's early, but...

22:06.858 --> 22:07.858
It's a statue
of St. Valentine.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.009
Well, actually,
it's a statue

22:09.010 --> 22:10.394
of one
of the three wise men

22:10.395 --> 22:12.178
I repainted to look
like Saint...

22:12.179 --> 22:13.382
I told Shane about us.

22:13.383 --> 22:15.884
Wow.

22:15.885 --> 22:18.220
Was he mad?
He was sad.

22:18.221 --> 22:21.473
He cried and said it felt like
I punched him in his heart.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.726
I saw this MMA guy get
punched in the heart once.

22:23.727 --> 22:25.769
He died for, like, a minute.

22:25.770 --> 22:27.313
That sucks.

22:27.314 --> 22:30.330
At least it means we can be
together for real now.

22:30.331 --> 22:32.049
Whoa.

22:32.050 --> 22:37.156
What we did... what I
did to Shane was wrong.

22:37.157 --> 22:40.307
I lied, I cheated,

22:40.308 --> 22:41.952
and it makes me feel awful,

22:41.953 --> 22:46.513
and I love you, but being with
you just reminds me of that...

22:46.514 --> 22:48.083
that I'm not the person
that I thought I was.

22:48.084 --> 22:49.877
We would never do that
to each other.

22:49.878 --> 22:51.985
I thought that I'd
never do that to Shane.

22:53.855 --> 22:55.215
But I have to face
the truth.

22:55.216 --> 22:59.026
When it comes to love,
I don't know who I am,

22:59.027 --> 23:03.057
and until I find out,
I can't be with anyone.

23:03.058 --> 23:06.283
I-I can't be with you.

This way.

28:15.536 --> 28:16.954
Smells great.
Delicious.

28:16.955 --> 28:18.322
LeROY: That was good.
Yeah, thank you.

28:18.323 --> 28:20.415
See, I have a couple of notes.

28:20.416 --> 28:22.042
I said, "LeRoy,
this guy sold us"

28:22.043 --> 28:23.828
the wrong lube."
Yeah.

28:23.829 --> 28:25.879
"That's why
the rubber is squeaking.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.839
"That's why it feels
so weird

28:27.840 --> 28:29.800
when we start going
really fast."

28:29.801 --> 28:31.718
Excuse me, Hiram, what
are we talking about?

28:31.719 --> 28:32.677
We're talking cars.

28:32.678 --> 28:33.871
Yeah, those clowns

28:33.872 --> 28:34.846
down at Local Lube...
they don't know

28:34.847 --> 28:35.887
how to lube a car.

28:35.888 --> 28:37.766
Hiram, the duck
was divine

28:37.767 --> 28:39.184
and the house is exquisite.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.344
HIRAM:
Thank you, sweetie.

28:40.345 --> 28:41.561
Nate Berkus...
a dear, dear friend.

28:41.562 --> 28:43.397
That's not true.

28:43.398 --> 28:45.266
Yeah, no, it's not, no, no,
no, not true, but it feels

28:45.267 --> 28:46.608
like he is, I love his designs

28:46.609 --> 28:47.943
so much.

28:47.944 --> 28:50.320
Everything is, you know,
Nate, Nate Berkus.

28:50.321 --> 28:52.823
So, Mr. Berrys,
how did you two meet?

28:52.824 --> 28:54.224
Ooh.
Ah.

28:54.225 --> 28:55.367
Hey, that's a,

28:55.368 --> 28:56.952
th-th-that's a funny story.

28:56.953 --> 28:59.830
We were both in the international
supergroup Up with People.

28:59.831 --> 29:01.832
Up with People was a sensation.

29:01.833 --> 29:04.584
Glenn Close, you know, she got
her start on Up with People.

29:04.585 --> 29:07.254
Yeah, and we've been together
ever since, which was, uh,

29:07.255 --> 29:09.673
in our late 20s, early 30s
when we got together.

29:09.674 --> 29:10.799
Uh, and on that note,

29:10.800 --> 29:12.384
may I make a toast

29:12.385 --> 29:17.298
to Rachel and Finn on this
very special Valentine's Day?

29:17.299 --> 29:20.100
Finn, you're a

29:20.101 --> 29:23.311
fantastic... husky

29:23.312 --> 29:27.808
young man whom LeRoy
and I simply adore,

29:27.809 --> 29:28.775
and it gives us

29:28.776 --> 29:30.694
such joy to see you make

29:30.695 --> 29:32.612
our little
Rachelah so happy.

29:32.613 --> 29:35.407
Let me tell you the secret of
a long and happy marriage...

29:35.408 --> 29:39.828
never go to bed
without moisturizing.

29:39.829 --> 29:40.871
Bet you thought
I was going

29:40.872 --> 29:42.272
to say "Never go
to bed angry."

29:42.273 --> 29:44.332
Okay, let's get
back on track here.

29:44.333 --> 29:47.294
A toast to the...

29:47.295 --> 29:49.780
Hudson-Hummel-Berry clan.

29:50.796 --> 29:53.751
And to Finn and Rachel.

29:53.752 --> 29:56.178
We love you both
so very, very much.

29:56.179 --> 29:57.596
We sure do.

29:57.597 --> 30:00.307
To Finn and Rachel.
Finn and Rachel. Indeed.

30:00.308 --> 30:01.391
HIRAM:
Mmm.

30:01.392 --> 30:02.893
Mm-mm-mm!

30:02.894 --> 30:04.011
Now dessert.

30:04.012 --> 30:05.228
Oh, you know what we've got?

30:05.229 --> 30:07.189
Velvety Viennetta,

30:07.190 --> 30:11.352
and then we're going to commence
with the teenage lovemaking.

30:13.471 --> 30:14.404
No, just kidding.

30:14.405 --> 30:15.655
(laughing):
No.

30:15.656 --> 30:18.074
We, we don't have Viennetta.

30:18.075 --> 30:19.577
They discontinued
Viennetta years ago.

30:19.578 --> 30:21.453
We're gonna go straight
to the teenage lovemaking.

30:21.454 --> 30:23.205
I'm sorry, what?
Yeah.

30:23.206 --> 30:24.456
Wait, w-what are
you talking about?

30:24.457 --> 30:25.833
Your mom packed a bag.

30:25.834 --> 30:28.335
I brought your toothbrush
and your jammies...

30:28.336 --> 30:29.836
- your sleepy T-shirt and, and boxers.
- Mom. No, I did, yeah.

30:29.837 --> 30:32.214
You're getting married,
you're not kids anymore.

30:32.215 --> 30:34.382
As far as we're concerned,
you're adults,

30:34.383 --> 30:36.760
so knock yourself out. Carole
and I are gonna go catch a movie.

30:36.761 --> 30:38.887
Hiram and I are going
to stay here,

30:38.888 --> 30:40.639
but we'll put on some music

30:40.640 --> 30:43.134
just so you don't think
we're trying to listen in.

30:46.354 --> 30:48.439
I can't believe
this is happening.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.724
I love you.

30:50.725 --> 30:52.643
Let's go to bed.

30:52.644 --> 30:54.478
Okay.

31:01.659 --> 31:02.869
I know it's tempting,

31:02.870 --> 31:04.329
but, uh,
no monkey business tonight,

31:04.330 --> 31:06.581
not with my dads
around the corner.

31:06.582 --> 31:08.209
Of course.

31:08.210 --> 31:10.043
Are you, you gonna use
the bathroom first?

31:10.044 --> 31:12.546
Yes, if that's okay because
my ritual is pretty elaborate.

31:12.547 --> 31:14.422
Okay.

31:14.423 --> 31:15.924
RACHEL:
<i>First I shower.</i>

31:15.925 --> 31:17.751
<i>I'm more thorough
than during my morning bath.</i>

31:17.752 --> 31:19.970
<i>The world is
a very dirty place.</i>

31:19.971 --> 31:23.181
<i>Brush teeth, eyebrows,
makeup remover, moisturizer,</i>

31:23.182 --> 31:24.975
<i>followed by an ice water
face bath</i>

31:24.976 --> 31:26.744
<i>Ã  la Joan Crawford
in</i> Mommie Dearest... 

31:26.745 --> 31:28.228
<i>the height of glamour.</i>

31:28.229 --> 31:29.263
<i>Find something cute to wear.</i>

31:29.264 --> 31:30.714
<i>Text my dads to let them know</i>

31:30.715 --> 31:32.216
<i>I'm almost ready
for my evening tea...</i>

31:32.217 --> 31:33.734
<i>well, we'll skip
that one tonight.</i>

31:33.735 --> 31:35.443
<i>Then condition
and brush my hair.</i>

31:35.444 --> 31:37.737
Hi.
Hi.

31:37.738 --> 31:39.907
Hey, I-I kind of need to use the
bathroom; it was a really big meal.

31:41.326 --> 31:43.285
No, you can't do that here.

31:43.286 --> 31:44.411
Where am I supposed to do it?

31:44.412 --> 31:46.538
Um, at your house?

31:46.539 --> 31:47.998
Hilarious... I'm just
gonna jump in beside you.

31:47.999 --> 31:48.957
I don't mind if you stay.

31:48.958 --> 31:50.417
Oh, for God's sakes, Finn.

31:50.418 --> 31:52.069
Can't you at least try to keep
some sort of mystery

31:52.070 --> 31:53.253
until we're married?

31:53.254 --> 31:54.921
What do you think it's gonna
be like in New York?

31:54.922 --> 31:56.340
We'll be on opposite
schedules, so, you know,

31:56.341 --> 31:57.875
you can use the bathroom
while I'm at school

31:57.876 --> 32:00.135
and I'll use it when you're
at... when you're working

32:00.136 --> 32:01.344
or what-whatever.

32:02.553 --> 32:05.056
What's that supposed
to mean?

32:05.057 --> 32:06.583
You don't think I'm gonna be
doing anything in New York?

32:06.584 --> 32:08.268
You think I'm just gonna be
around to bring you Diet Cokes

32:08.269 --> 32:09.311
and cheer you on?

32:09.312 --> 32:10.554
RACHEL (muffled):
I knew it.

32:10.555 --> 32:11.605
I knew one day
you'd be intimidated

32:11.606 --> 32:12.689
by my success,
but I didn't think

32:12.690 --> 32:13.941
it would be before we graduated.

32:17.359 --> 32:18.229
Where are you going?

32:18.230 --> 32:19.763
The bathroom downstairs.

32:19.764 --> 32:21.598
I can guarantee one thing
you're not gonna have to add

32:21.599 --> 32:23.450
to your little crazy-town
nighttime ritual...

32:23.451 --> 32:25.152
getting into
bed with me.

32:29.374 --> 32:31.235
(Sighs)

32:38.481 --> 32:41.149
FYI, we got a private
party here tonight, hon.

32:41.150 --> 32:43.720
Oh, I know, I know,
I'm, I'm early.

32:43.721 --> 32:47.039
Well, according to
this, I'm, I'm early.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.933
I'm supposed to be
meeting my cutie here

32:48.934 --> 32:49.976
for a long overdue
reunion,

32:49.977 --> 32:53.438
but I, uh, I guess
he didn't make it.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.514
Wouldn't be too sure
about that.

32:59.443 --> 33:01.363
I knew it!

33:01.364 --> 33:03.606
Oh, See's candies!

33:03.607 --> 33:06.284
"Dear Kurt,
Happy Valentine's Day.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.661
I think I love you."

33:07.662 --> 33:09.746
Wait. You <i>think</i> you love me?

33:15.652 --> 33:17.486
Karofsky.

33:19.213 --> 33:22.550
So, you tormented me,
shoved me into lockers,

33:22.551 --> 33:24.552
called me horrible names and

33:24.553 --> 33:26.971
hate-kissed me.

33:26.972 --> 33:28.473
Now, after one conversation

33:28.474 --> 33:30.475
in a bar, you want us
to be together?

33:30.476 --> 33:33.436
When I was at McKinley,
I hated who I was.

33:33.437 --> 33:35.587
I took that out
on you because...

33:35.588 --> 33:38.900
there you were, so proud.

33:38.901 --> 33:42.237
I've wanted to call you since
that night at Scandals, and,

33:42.238 --> 33:44.563
look, it's taken me a while,

33:44.564 --> 33:46.682
but for the first time
in my life,

33:46.683 --> 33:50.912
I'm trying to be honest
about what I feel.

33:50.913 --> 33:54.332
And I'm flattered,
I... I-I really am, but

33:54.333 --> 33:56.584
David, you just think
that you love me.

33:56.585 --> 33:58.128
You don't really love me.

33:58.129 --> 34:00.529
Oh, you've helped me so much,
Kurt, you don't know.

34:00.530 --> 34:02.081
I haven't come out
at school yet,

34:02.082 --> 34:03.449
but maybe I will next year.

34:03.450 --> 34:04.759
David, look,

34:04.760 --> 34:07.470
I am so proud of you for...
for coming so far.

34:07.471 --> 34:09.889
And I want you
to be happy and...

34:09.889 --> 34:11.674
and you will be happy,

34:11.675 --> 34:13.542
but I'm with Blaine.

34:16.020 --> 34:18.714
A-And... I like you.

34:18.715 --> 34:20.984
But just as friends.

34:20.985 --> 34:22.777
I should go.

34:22.777 --> 34:25.554
Wait.
Now, you don't have to go.

34:26.989 --> 34:28.891
I hope you like the candies.

34:28.891 --> 34:30.976
The butterscotch ones
are my favorite.

34:33.036 --> 34:35.456
Mine, too.

34:35.458 --> 34:37.500
Hey, Karofsky.
Nick.

34:37.501 --> 34:39.753
You guys hanging out
for Valentine's Day?

34:39.754 --> 34:40.985
No. No.

34:40.987 --> 34:43.554
No, no. We-We used
to go to the same school.

34:43.556 --> 34:45.132
We just bumped
into each other.

34:45.134 --> 34:47.260
- That's exactly what it looked like.
- I gotta go.

34:47.261 --> 34:50.013
David...
I'll talk to you later.

34:50.014 --> 34:52.081
(laughs)

34:54.833 --> 34:56.918
I'm really glad we
kissed and made up.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.637
I mean, it is Valentine's
Day, after all.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.339
Mm-hmm.

35:00.340 --> 35:02.341
This whole living
together thing

35:02.342 --> 35:04.459
and being right on
top of one another...

35:04.460 --> 35:07.096
it's definitely a lot more
challenging than I thought.

35:07.097 --> 35:08.564
It's like real
life and stuff.

35:08.565 --> 35:09.932
I know.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.183
I have to be honest.

35:11.184 --> 35:13.135
I was a little...

35:13.136 --> 35:16.498
afraid of what it would be like
for us to really be married.

35:16.499 --> 35:17.740
I don't know.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.250
I think we can
do it, right?

35:19.251 --> 35:21.693
I think we can.

35:23.179 --> 35:24.997
Good.

35:26.149 --> 35:27.482
Mm.

35:27.483 --> 35:29.219
Mm.
Mm.

35:31.004 --> 35:33.655
Except for one thing.

35:33.656 --> 35:35.600
It's 7:15.
No way.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.259
Yeah.

35:39.462 --> 35:41.346
You want to go to Breadstix?

35:41.347 --> 35:43.048
I was hoping you'd say that.

35:43.049 --> 35:44.216
Let's go.

35:45.718 --> 35:47.737
LeROY:
I like

35:47.738 --> 35:49.531
Carole after three
Chardonnays.

35:49.532 --> 35:51.699
Shh. Listen, listen.

35:51.700 --> 35:53.508
Shh. Listen.

35:55.202 --> 35:56.511
Silence.

35:56.512 --> 35:57.956
They're not fighting anymore.

35:57.957 --> 35:59.165
It's not working.

35:59.166 --> 36:00.416
What, is he defiling
our baby?

36:00.417 --> 36:02.701
- Do you need a Xanax?
- I already took three.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.420
This is a stupid plan.
We've never

36:04.421 --> 36:05.964
lied to her
like this before.

36:05.965 --> 36:08.508
Honesty, respect, dance...

36:08.509 --> 36:10.176
those are the foundations
of the Berry family.

36:10.177 --> 36:12.512
These are desperate times.

36:12.513 --> 36:13.805
Every teenager does

36:13.806 --> 36:16.141
the exact opposite
of what their parents tell them.

36:16.142 --> 36:19.394
I don't know where she got
this idea of marriage anyway,

36:19.395 --> 36:22.522
but she's not going
to go through with it.

36:22.523 --> 36:26.609
She is a little girl
with big dreams...

36:26.610 --> 36:28.570
It's too bad. I like Finn.

36:28.571 --> 36:32.282
Nobody is saying that
they have to break up.

36:32.283 --> 36:34.450
They're just too
young to get married.

36:34.451 --> 36:37.537
As long as we continue
to do what we're doing...

36:37.538 --> 36:41.106
lying about supporting it
utterly and completely...

36:41.107 --> 36:43.209
she'll come around, and
she'll see it our way.

36:43.210 --> 36:44.836
It's reverse psychology.

36:44.837 --> 36:46.921
- It's the only way.
- RACHEL: Hey.

36:46.922 --> 36:48.506
We're gonna go
go Breadstix.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.758
We decided that we want to just
be with our friends tonight.

36:50.759 --> 36:53.303
And then I'm probably
just gonna go home after.

36:53.304 --> 36:54.953
R-Really?

36:54.954 --> 36:57.849
Yeah, we thought we heard
you guys squabbling up there.

36:57.850 --> 37:00.226
Cohabitating is
not-not-not so easy, huh?

37:00.227 --> 37:02.187
LeROY: I hope this
little experiment

37:02.188 --> 37:06.524
doesn't cause you to postpone
the marriage for a few months?

37:06.525 --> 37:08.851
- HIRAM: Right, or years.
- Don't do that.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.195
Actually, it's the opposite.

37:10.196 --> 37:11.654
We just decided
that, you know,

37:11.655 --> 37:14.115
since it's gonna take us
a little while to get used

37:14.116 --> 37:17.285
to one another, that we might
as well just, you know,

37:17.286 --> 37:18.694
get started.

37:18.695 --> 37:20.262
We're getting
married in May!

37:20.263 --> 37:21.456
Right-Right after Nationals!

37:21.457 --> 37:22.540
It's gonna be a
spring wedding.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.266
(Rachel laughs)

37:24.267 --> 37:27.319
I'll talk to you guys more about
it when I get home tonight.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.463
I'm so excited.
(Hiram mutters)

37:28.464 --> 37:30.298
- And I love you both very much.
- Love you

37:30.299 --> 37:31.606
so much.

37:31.607 --> 37:34.385
Okay, well, I'll be
back in a little while.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.078
Bye.

37:41.474 --> 37:44.228

Welcome to the Sugar Shack!

37:52.363 --> 37:54.155
Okay.

37:54.156 --> 37:56.488
Everyone look under your
chairs, except you, Artie.

37:56.489 --> 37:58.910
Yours is in the potted plant
right behind you.

38:09.463 --> 38:10.964
(Cheering and applause)

38:10.965 --> 38:13.889
I would like to thank my daddy
for making tonight possible.

38:13.890 --> 38:15.957
And P.S.:
He is not in the Mafia.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.843
And next up,
straight from heaven above,

38:17.844 --> 38:19.555
give it up for the God Squad!

38:19.556 --> 38:23.768
(Applause and cheering)

38:23.769 --> 38:26.354
Hi. My name's Joe.
Santana Lopez asked me

38:26.355 --> 38:27.770
if the God Squad
would sing a love song

38:27.771 --> 38:29.071
for Brittany S. Pierce.

38:29.072 --> 38:30.739
And after thinking
and praying about it,

38:30.740 --> 38:32.068
I knew there was only one
right answer.

38:34.069 --> 38:35.744
Absolutely.

38:35.745 --> 38:36.945
Love is love, man.

38:36.946 --> 38:39.909
So, here's for Brittany
from Santana.

38:39.910 --> 38:41.869

and whooping)
