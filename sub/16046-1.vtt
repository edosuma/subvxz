# Happy birthday to you #

01:14.329 --> 01:17.953
# Happy birthday to you #

01:18.033 --> 01:22.624
# Happy birthday, dear Charlie #

01:22.704 --> 01:26.982
# Happy birthday to you #

01:27.976 --> 01:30.332
Charlie, why don't you tell us
what you wanna thank God for

01:30.412 --> 01:32.119
and close your eyes and make a wish?

01:33.882 --> 01:36.372
Six months of sobriety?

01:36.452 --> 01:38.159
Nothing you wanna say?

02:07.216 --> 02:09.627
# Everybody wants to laugh #

02:11.453 --> 02:14.627
# Ah, but nobody wants to cry #

02:20.729 --> 02:24.006
# I say, everybody wants to laugh #

02:27.769 --> 02:30.545
# But nobody wants to cry #

02:34.510 --> 02:37.218
# Everybody wants to go to heaven #

02:39.581 --> 02:42.528
# But nobody wants to die #

03:13.182 --> 03:16.129
# Everybody wanna know the reason #

03:19.354 --> 03:22.494
# Without even asking why #

03:28.397 --> 03:31.674
# Oh, every wanna know the reason #

03:35.204 --> 03:38.378
# All without even asking why #

03:55.490 --> 03:57.401
Thanks.

04:02.864 --> 04:05.120
You look like you came from a funeral.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.823
Close... a birthday.

04:08.903 --> 04:12.027
That's dark, man. Where you headed?

04:12.807 --> 04:14.630
Los Angeles.

04:14.710 --> 04:18.555
I can take you to a bus station,
but I gotta drop her off first.

04:21.850 --> 04:24.206
- Is this cool?
- Yeah, at this point,

04:24.286 --> 04:26.630
- it won't make a difference.
- All right.

04:28.423 --> 04:32.848
- What's wrong with her?
- Besides her general disposition?

04:32.928 --> 04:34.965
It's cancer.

04:48.277 --> 04:51.066
Let me get you in your chair, Ma.

04:51.146 --> 04:53.683
There we go. There you go.

04:56.785 --> 05:00.075
Hey, uh, think I could use your phone?

05:00.155 --> 05:02.362
Sure.

05:04.059 --> 05:06.403
- Thanks.
- I'll be right back.

05:10.866 --> 05:14.473
Here we go. Maybe your show's on, huh?

05:15.804 --> 05:17.659
Hi, we're not home. Leave a message.

05:17.739 --> 05:20.162
Hey, um...

05:20.242 --> 05:22.381
it's me.

05:23.679 --> 05:25.667
I'm coming home.

05:25.747 --> 05:28.804
Uh, just wanted to
let you know that I'm okay,

05:28.884 --> 05:31.194
and, um...

05:32.587 --> 05:35.759
I think things are gonna be
different this time, so...

05:36.925 --> 05:39.281
Yeah, uh...

05:39.361 --> 05:42.137
okay, bye.

05:57.879 --> 06:01.203
Hey, man, um, mind if I use your bathroom?

06:01.283 --> 06:03.005
Yeah, go ahead.

06:03.085 --> 06:04.906
It's just, uh, down the hall to the left.

06:28.276 --> 06:31.700
Kid. Hey, kid!

06:31.780 --> 06:33.368
- You still with us?
- Yeah, man.

06:33.448 --> 06:36.138
- Yeah.
- Can I get a smoke?

06:36.218 --> 06:37.806
Yeah.

06:41.456 --> 06:44.446
- What are those?
- Oh, Camels.

06:44.526 --> 06:46.381
No, the pills, man.

06:46.461 --> 06:50.552
Oh, uh... I, uh, I got my wisdom teeth out.

06:50.632 --> 06:52.387
Yeah? What you working with, Perks?

06:52.467 --> 06:54.242
No, uh...

06:55.437 --> 06:57.893
I switched the labels around, I'm not, uh...

06:57.973 --> 07:00.228
- Let me see those.
- Yeah, yeah, man.

07:00.308 --> 07:01.981
- These are, um...
- Let me see those!

07:04.446 --> 07:06.401
My mother's Oxys?

07:06.481 --> 07:08.603
- What the fuck, man?
- Oh!

07:08.683 --> 07:11.840
- What else you take?
- Nothing, man, just those.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.366
Get the fuck outta here! Get outta here!

07:32.374 --> 07:34.863
Adam...

07:34.943 --> 07:36.980
your phone.

07:40.549 --> 07:42.722
Adam, your phone is ringing.

07:45.487 --> 07:48.677
- What are you doing?
- You have like three missed calls.

07:48.757 --> 07:51.046
What, are you my fucking secretary?

07:51.126 --> 07:53.615
Who do you know from Utah?

07:53.695 --> 07:56.051
No one.

07:56.131 --> 07:58.120
Shit! Charlie.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.556
- I have to go. Shit!
- What about your parents?

08:01.636 --> 08:03.792
Eh, don't worry about them.

08:03.872 --> 08:06.461
You're just gonna leave all this out here?

08:06.541 --> 08:09.064
Yeah, they don't come up here anyway.

08:10.636 --> 08:12.066
All right.

08:13.949 --> 08:17.192
Just don't do any while I'm gone.

08:29.898 --> 08:32.554
There he is.

08:32.634 --> 08:35.123
Hey, man. Ah...

08:35.203 --> 08:38.226
- It's good to see you.
- Oh, God.

08:38.306 --> 08:40.429
- Thanks for getting me.
- Are you kidding?

08:40.509 --> 08:41.996
I can't get enough of Barstow.

08:42.077 --> 08:44.065
# Book me in when I'm headed downtown #

08:44.145 --> 08:46.468
# Give my crews pounds,
they don't fool around #

08:46.548 --> 08:48.603
# Pullin' back of the crews with no doubt #

08:48.683 --> 08:51.163
# When I'm rolling dice,
I got my boys on the lookout... #

08:52.621 --> 08:56.044
So, who you been hanging out with?

08:56.324 --> 08:58.180
No one, really.

08:58.260 --> 09:01.416
Just been, uh, just spend
a lot of time with this girl.

09:01.496 --> 09:04.453
Actually, it's, uh, Stacey.

09:04.533 --> 09:06.354
Stacey?

09:06.434 --> 09:08.356
Stacey Chapman?

09:08.436 --> 09:11.827
Stacey... Why would you ever
hang out with Stacey Chapman?

09:11.907 --> 09:13.228
She's a fucking train...

09:13.308 --> 09:14.963
- Boom.
- Holy shit.

09:15.043 --> 09:15.997
- Right?
- Wow.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.899
- She really changed.
- She's blossomed.

09:17.979 --> 09:19.868
Yeah.

09:19.948 --> 09:21.102
- What about you?
- Me?

09:21.182 --> 09:23.972
Oh, glad you asked.

09:24.052 --> 09:25.607
What do you think, hmm?

09:25.687 --> 09:27.042
- She's a beaut, right?
- Yeah.

09:27.122 --> 09:28.543
Yeah.

09:28.623 --> 09:31.813
She really listens to me, too.

09:31.893 --> 09:34.850
So, uh, how's Tyler, man?
I miss that motherfucker.

09:34.930 --> 09:38.139
- Uh, started at UMich.
- Yeah?

09:39.901 --> 09:42.290
How's Jackson?

09:42.370 --> 09:45.476
Uh... a lot better than
the last time you saw him.

09:49.177 --> 09:51.500
- What a fucking night, huh?
- I think he, uh...

09:51.580 --> 09:54.302
went to Stanford
but he dropped out or something.

09:54.382 --> 09:55.337
I don't know.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.522
But, hey, I'm still here.

10:03.658 --> 10:05.948
Fucking Barstow.

10:06.528 --> 10:08.817
I guess we're just gonna have to improvise.

10:11.533 --> 10:13.622
- No...
- DJ Mills.

10:13.702 --> 10:14.823
- No, man.
- Come on.

10:14.903 --> 10:15.891
I'm not doing it.

10:15.971 --> 10:17.526
- Come on, the beat's dropping, baby.
- I'm not doing it, no, man.

10:17.606 --> 10:20.428
I'm not... I'm not gonna...

10:20.508 --> 10:22.697
Unh.

10:22.777 --> 10:25.734
# I'm lean, mean, joint-smoking machine #

10:25.814 --> 10:28.837
# With zero fucks given now that I'm 18 #

10:28.917 --> 10:31.540
# I know that I'm white
and I don't know the lingo #

10:31.620 --> 10:34.209
# Copying styles like I work at Kinkos #

10:34.289 --> 10:36.211
- Oh!
- # Finally clear-headed #

10:36.291 --> 10:37.312
# But not sober #

10:37.392 --> 10:40.282
# And the smartest kid around
without a high school diploma #

10:40.362 --> 10:41.316
- Oh!
- Unh.

10:41.396 --> 10:43.118
# And I keep getting smarter #

10:43.198 --> 10:47.022
# If you wanna fuck with me,
then bop, bop, bop #

10:47.102 --> 10:49.558
# Aaron Carter #

10:49.638 --> 10:51.760
- Aaron Carter?
- Yeah.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.396
- Okay.
- I boxed myself in with "smarter."

10:54.476 --> 10:56.598
# Fresh off the flight, sunset #

10:56.678 --> 10:59.234
# Thought I saw Snoop at the back
in the coupe to the right #

10:59.314 --> 11:02.070
# Yeah, the blue with the white,
feed it on, feed it on #

11:02.150 --> 11:04.406
# Have your whole style
shitted on first sight #

11:04.486 --> 11:06.975
# Party at Dre's, rooftop, room's hot #

11:07.055 --> 11:09.311
# Chicks with the boo-wop going both ways #

11:09.391 --> 11:11.746
# This be the banger
for the ones on Cahuenga #

11:11.826 --> 11:14.649
# Shorty outside
thinking I'm a pop singer... #

11:14.729 --> 11:17.118
Maybe you should hit up some open mics again.

11:17.198 --> 11:20.689
You should have some great material
from all those places.

11:20.769 --> 11:22.157
Yeah, maybe.

11:22.237 --> 11:24.492
# Looking good on my way to L.A. #

11:24.572 --> 11:26.895
# Rodeo, B. Hills #

11:26.975 --> 11:29.130
# Homie, this is how it feels
on the way to L.A. #

11:29.210 --> 11:31.066
# The L.A. way, pretty every day #

11:31.146 --> 11:33.868
# Got Hollywood Hill skills,
hear what I say? #

11:33.948 --> 11:35.757
# Kobe shoots... #

11:38.820 --> 11:41.376
# I got my Swishers with me,
I got some bitches with me #

11:41.456 --> 11:44.232
# You coming with me? I'm on my way to L.A. #

11:49.264 --> 11:51.471
Guess they forgot the "welcome home" banner.

11:58.673 --> 12:00.710
- It's gonna be okay.
- Ah...

12:02.577 --> 12:04.232
Yeah. I mean, it's gotta be.

12:04.312 --> 12:07.268
I mean, I'm 18,
and they can't just throw me out,

12:07.348 --> 12:09.738
so we're just gonna...

12:09.818 --> 12:12.741
we're just gonna have to hash it out.

12:12.821 --> 12:15.210
You want me to come in with you?

12:15.290 --> 12:18.013
Yeah.

12:18.093 --> 12:19.814
Yeah, you can say a quick hi.

12:19.894 --> 12:22.050
- Do I smell like weed?
- No.

12:22.130 --> 12:23.507
I think I smell like weed.

12:28.703 --> 12:30.444
Hello?

12:32.741 --> 12:34.584
Mom?

12:39.080 --> 12:41.356
Hello?

12:42.484 --> 12:46.041
- Hey.
- Hi, Charlie.

12:46.121 --> 12:47.842
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

12:47.922 --> 12:51.112
- Happy birthday, sweetie.
- Yeah, happy birthday, son.

12:51.192 --> 12:53.069
Thanks.

12:54.529 --> 12:57.635
- Hi, Adam.
- Hey, Miss Mills.

13:02.437 --> 13:05.493
Oh, you must be Charlie.

13:05.573 --> 13:07.712
Welcome, have a seat.

13:09.978 --> 13:12.333
A fucking intervention. Really?

13:12.413 --> 13:14.469
- I... Did you know about this?
- No, I swear.

13:14.549 --> 13:17.038
- Charlie, please...
- Mrs. Mills, allow me.

13:17.118 --> 13:18.306
- This is what I do.
- Oh, you mean

13:18.386 --> 13:20.709
- you're not a personal trainer?
- Charlie, take a seat.

13:20.789 --> 13:24.079
- Mr. Mills, just stay calm.
- Dad, I'm not gonna sit here and listen

13:24.159 --> 13:26.281
to you tell me what a piece of shit
drug addict I am.

13:26.361 --> 13:29.718
- No one said that you're a piece...
- You need to go back.

13:29.798 --> 13:33.455
How many times do I have to tell you,
those places, they don't work for me.

13:33.535 --> 13:35.557
Look, no one said that sobriety was easy.

13:35.637 --> 13:38.259
Can you never speak again?
That'd be... that'd be great.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.228
Just why can't I stay here? Please?

13:40.308 --> 13:44.365
That's, um, that's not an option right now.

13:44.445 --> 13:46.391
We're here to save your life, Charlie.

13:47.448 --> 13:50.638
Can we just talk about this?
Let's just talk about it, please.

13:51.618 --> 13:53.575
Your mother and I...

13:53.655 --> 13:55.225
have already decided.

13:56.291 --> 13:57.712
Mom?

13:57.792 --> 14:01.149
Ahem, Charlie, I want you
to be back home with us...

14:01.229 --> 14:04.686
Honey, we just discussed this, remember?

14:04.766 --> 14:06.588
Can't let him manipulate you.

14:06.668 --> 14:08.523
I'm not manipulating her.

14:08.603 --> 14:10.391
I'm asking her for her opinion.

14:10.471 --> 14:12.293
- You should try it some time.
- How fucking dare you.

14:12.373 --> 14:13.995
Careful, I'm one of your constituents now.

14:14.075 --> 14:16.164
You wouldn't wanna lose
the governor's race by one vote.

14:16.244 --> 14:18.666
Okay, you know what?
Here's how it's gonna go.

14:18.746 --> 14:20.735
You can either head back to treatment
or live on the streets.

14:20.815 --> 14:23.037
- It's your choice.
- That's an easy one.

14:23.117 --> 14:25.106
- No, Charlie.
- Honey, honey.

14:25.186 --> 14:28.142
- Okay, can you not...
- I can't believe you.

14:28.622 --> 14:30.578
I'm sorry, we did not discuss
him living on the streets.

14:30.658 --> 14:31.613
- Yeah, we did...
- That was not an option.

14:31.693 --> 14:33.114
- Okay, you know what?
- We couldn't have just listened...

14:33.194 --> 14:35.083
He comes in here reeking of pot
with his drug buddy...

14:35.163 --> 14:38.620
Yo, Charlie! Charlie!

14:38.700 --> 14:40.388
Look, man, I knew that was gonna happen.

14:40.468 --> 14:41.623
- Let's just be smart about this, okay?
- I told you!

14:41.703 --> 14:44.292
- Oh, what, you're taking their side?
- No, no, man.

14:44.372 --> 14:45.927
I'm on your side, all right? It's just...

14:46.007 --> 14:48.062
Look, it's all about knowing
when to fuck up, all right?

14:48.142 --> 14:50.565
You think your dad's gonna give a shit
about any of this when he's elected?

14:50.645 --> 14:53.401
No, no, he's gonna be in Sacramento
doing his governor thing.

14:53.481 --> 14:55.937
That's the point, man.
Now it's about fucking up his campaign.

14:56.017 --> 14:57.972
Then it will be about fucking up his agenda.

14:58.052 --> 15:00.341
Right, you're right. Go ahead.
Go... go do what you always do.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.577
Go shoot up, prove everyone right.

15:02.657 --> 15:05.069
With no money, what are you gonna do, huh?

15:06.060 --> 15:09.371
Go down to Skid Row
and wave your virgin asshole around?

15:11.099 --> 15:14.622
Just... stick it out for 30 days.

15:14.702 --> 15:17.926
You know, I'll be moving out my parents
and have my own place for sophomore year,

15:18.006 --> 15:20.543
you can... you can stay there
as long as you want.

15:26.281 --> 15:28.269
Right. No.

15:28.349 --> 15:29.851
You're right.

15:32.487 --> 15:35.968
Besides, I should probably save my virgin
asshole for that special someone, right?

15:38.359 --> 15:41.340
Someone who, uh,
you know, love me for me, right?

15:42.363 --> 15:44.206
I could be that guy.

15:44.799 --> 15:48.122
I just... I just can't take another one
of those lockdown places, you know?

15:48.202 --> 15:49.958
They said it was supposed to be like a hotel.

15:50.038 --> 15:51.259
Yeah, they always say that.

15:51.339 --> 15:53.962
I'll probably walk the second I get there.

15:54.042 --> 15:56.564
I'm here if you need me.
I'll be thinking about you.

15:56.644 --> 15:57.966
Oh, sure you will. Yeah.

15:58.046 --> 16:01.135
You'll be sniffing coke off of
some sorority girl's tits thinking,

16:01.215 --> 16:03.504
"I wonder how Charlie's sobriety is coming?"

16:03.584 --> 16:05.723
Lift your scrotum, please.

16:16.097 --> 16:20.989
It just covers you like
a warm blanket, inside and out.

16:21.069 --> 16:23.057
Hey, it's the new guy.

16:23.137 --> 16:26.160
How you doing, new guy?
They probably put him in Joe's room.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.896
Yeah, he was way to cool for this place.

16:27.976 --> 16:30.098
Yeah, he flew the cuckoo's nest,
went McMurphy.

16:30.178 --> 16:35.136
You guys do nothing but complain about
how you can't stand it in this place here,

16:35.216 --> 16:37.839
but you don't have the guts to just walk out?

16:37.919 --> 16:39.407
Paul, just finish, man.

16:40.187 --> 16:43.378
Okay, so all I'm saying is,

16:43.458 --> 16:46.447
you could be under a bridge in a cold rain

16:46.527 --> 16:48.750
and still feel the warmth.

16:48.830 --> 16:50.919
You could... hit the lottery,

16:50.999 --> 16:54.555
win the Nobel Prize,
and bang the homecoming queen

16:54.635 --> 16:59.360
all at the same time,
and it wouldn't touch that first rush.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.829
Fuck. Man.

17:01.909 --> 17:03.398
I'm sold.

17:03.478 --> 17:06.134
But every shot after that...

17:06.214 --> 17:08.435
just sloppy seconds.

17:08.516 --> 17:11.172
The luck ones, just mourn the feeling.

17:11.252 --> 17:14.597
But most end up chasing it to the grave.

17:15.690 --> 17:18.512
Okay, open your eyes.

17:18.593 --> 17:23.518
So, before we start, would anybody like
to share feelings about Joe's departure?

17:23.598 --> 17:25.339
Joe's gone?

17:28.136 --> 17:31.140
No one has anything to share?

17:33.107 --> 17:35.463
I have something.

17:35.543 --> 17:38.099
Before group,
I couldn't help but overhear Paul

17:38.179 --> 17:42.270
talking explicitly and glowingly

17:42.350 --> 17:44.272
about heroin usage.

17:44.352 --> 17:46.975
And I feel, in light of Joe's relapse,

17:47.055 --> 17:51.646
this kind of drug talk is counterproductive
to working a rigorous program.

17:51.726 --> 17:53.114
Yeah, Joe failed.

17:53.194 --> 17:55.883
He, uh, failed to see
his disease for what is it.

17:55.963 --> 17:59.454
I guess, for some people, it takes a while.

17:59.534 --> 18:01.622
They lose sight of why they're here.

18:01.702 --> 18:07.662
Or as I can figure it out,
it's because I, um, I fuck too much.

18:09.142 --> 18:11.217
I think it's a little more than that.

18:11.317 --> 18:13.434
I could put a bug so far up your ass

18:13.514 --> 18:17.271
you wouldn't know whether to take
a shit or wind your wrist watch.

18:17.351 --> 18:20.074
- Okay, that's enough.
- What is it with you and that stupid movie?

18:20.154 --> 18:23.210
I don't wanna break up
the meeting or nothing,

18:23.290 --> 18:25.113
but she's something of a cunt,
ain't she, Doc?

18:25.193 --> 18:27.448
- Language!
- I'd like to break that fucking DVD.

18:27.528 --> 18:30.618
If you break that DVD, we're down to
"The Notebook" and "Cars 2."

18:30.698 --> 18:32.653
People, enough!

18:32.733 --> 18:36.758
Look, I know this is an open forum,
but can we please keep it to the parameters

18:36.838 --> 18:39.512
of acceptance, solution, and commitment?

18:40.608 --> 18:41.863
Dylan.

18:41.943 --> 18:45.400
Yeah, so, uh, in the spirit of
the open forum,

18:45.480 --> 18:49.504
I was wondering why a myriad of web
domains are blocked in the computer room.

18:49.584 --> 18:51.139
You mean porn?

18:51.219 --> 18:52.974
No.

18:53.054 --> 18:57.045
No, I was referring to certain destinations
within the political blogosphere.

18:57.125 --> 18:59.847
There's an outpouring of stimulating
and thought-provoking material

18:59.927 --> 19:01.482
that we're being denied access to.

19:01.562 --> 19:03.117
The only outpouring you're interested in

19:03.197 --> 19:06.119
is gonna wind up getting stuck
to the fucking keyboard.

19:06.534 --> 19:10.758
Guys, the rules of the computer room
are not relevant right now.

19:10.838 --> 19:13.761
What is relevant is acceptance.

19:13.841 --> 19:17.331
That's what your recovery is all about.

19:17.411 --> 19:22.258
Having the serenity to accept
the things we cannot change.

19:29.891 --> 19:32.914
Joining us today, we have Charlie Mills.

19:32.994 --> 19:35.083
Hi, Charlie.

19:35.163 --> 19:38.975
Is there anything you'd like
to share with us today, Charlie?

19:40.134 --> 19:42.171
No.

19:43.171 --> 19:46.360
No.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.942
Okay, Charlie.

19:50.378 --> 19:53.334
Well, just know that if you continue
to refuse to accept

19:53.414 --> 19:56.104
the disease that put you here,

19:56.184 --> 19:58.721
you will continue to be a repeat offender.

19:59.754 --> 20:01.597
Don't you mean repeat customer?

20:06.227 --> 20:09.584
You have a disease, Charlie.
We all do, all right?

20:09.664 --> 20:12.386
And acceptance is the first step
towards controlling...

20:12.466 --> 20:14.288
You know, you're right. I do have a disease.

20:14.368 --> 20:16.290
It's this place, okay?

20:16.370 --> 20:18.926
It makes you feel like a fucking leper,
and then, when you get out,

20:19.006 --> 20:21.362
everyone's expecting you
to fuck up again, so you start using.

20:21.442 --> 20:24.899
And then, it's like,
you hold their heads underwater,

20:24.979 --> 20:27.201
but then come down on us
for trying to come up for air.

20:27.281 --> 20:29.937
Sobriety is your breath of fresh air.

20:30.017 --> 20:31.706
It's your ticket out, and it's priceless.

20:31.786 --> 20:34.642
Priceless? Really?

20:34.722 --> 20:37.512
What's the entrance fee
to this place nowadays?

20:37.592 --> 20:39.680
20K?

20:39.760 --> 20:41.749
You're no better than the guy on the corner,

20:41.829 --> 20:45.820
okay, but you're not slinging dope,
you're slinging false hope and serenity.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.922
And you got everybody hooked...
doctors, parents,

20:48.002 --> 20:51.125
teachers, lawyers, even the judges.

20:51.205 --> 20:53.561
And we're paying out the fucking nose for it.

20:53.641 --> 20:56.130
- You think I do this for the money?
- No.

20:56.210 --> 21:00.852
No, I think you do this for
the courtside seats to human suffering.

21:09.357 --> 21:11.837
Can't watch you do that anymore.

21:12.827 --> 21:15.273
Hey, thanks.

21:16.597 --> 21:19.220
I liked your, uh, your "Cuckoo's Nest" bit.

21:19.300 --> 21:23.090
Yeah? Been in and out
of these places for 20 years,

21:23.170 --> 21:26.227
and all I got to show for
it's a bag of newcomer chips

21:26.307 --> 21:29.697
and an okay Nicholson impersonation.

21:31.377 --> 21:36.223
Excuse me. I don't mean to pry,
but are you David Mills' son?

21:38.386 --> 21:40.609
See, I told you!

21:41.289 --> 21:43.344
I'm a huge fan.

21:43.424 --> 21:45.680
# Yo, ho, ho, ho #

21:45.760 --> 21:47.348
# The battle has begun #

21:47.428 --> 21:50.251
- I fucking love that pirate shit, man.
- Oh, man.

21:50.331 --> 21:53.454
- Did he do his own fencing?
- Charlie!

21:53.534 --> 21:56.190
- Need you in the office.
- I'll be right there.

21:56.270 --> 21:58.011
Now, kiddo.

21:59.674 --> 22:01.529
Yep.

22:01.609 --> 22:04.215
Keep your head down, brother.

22:07.281 --> 22:09.136
You know why you're here?

22:09.216 --> 22:11.339
Let me take a crack at it.

22:11.419 --> 22:13.474
You're gonna say that I'm being difficult,

22:13.554 --> 22:15.710
and that is hindering
not only my own recovery

22:15.790 --> 22:17.963
but the recovery of those around me.

22:23.430 --> 22:27.221
Thank you, sir, for, uh,
taking time out of your very busy day.

22:27.301 --> 22:31.692
- Hello? Charlie?
- Dad.

22:31.772 --> 22:33.361
What do you think you're doing?

22:33.441 --> 22:35.263
Don't know what you're talking about, Dad.

22:35.343 --> 22:38.899
Not one day goes by,
and already they want to throw you out.

22:38.979 --> 22:41.035
Sounds good.

22:41.115 --> 22:43.170
Go ahead, be glib.

22:43.250 --> 22:46.507
You think just 'cause you're 18,
everything will magically slide off you?

22:46.587 --> 22:48.242
It doesn't work that way, Charlie.

22:48.322 --> 22:51.012
Well, tell me, Dad, how does it work?

22:51.092 --> 22:53.914
Wanna be your own man, make your own choices?

22:53.994 --> 22:55.750
Live with the consequences.

22:55.830 --> 22:58.953
I got a call about that stunt
you pulled up in Utah.

22:59.033 --> 23:01.722
Yeah, they wanted to press charges.

23:01.802 --> 23:04.792
But I pulled some strings
with a friend who knows the judge.

23:04.872 --> 23:08.362
And they said if you cooperate,
they'll let it go.

23:08.442 --> 23:10.364
But, hey, you're 18.

23:10.444 --> 23:12.633
You do whatever you want.

23:12.713 --> 23:16.937
Just know, if you don't comply,
you won't have to answer to me.

23:17.017 --> 23:19.440
You'll be facing possible jail time in Utah.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.329
It's your choice.

23:23.190 --> 23:25.079
Fine. You know what?

23:25.159 --> 23:27.448
I'll do the 30 days.

23:27.528 --> 23:30.651
And you can't just go through
the motions this time, Charlie.

23:30.731 --> 23:33.554
You have to complete the program
to their satisfaction.

23:33.634 --> 23:36.957
That could be longer than 30 days.

23:37.037 --> 23:38.859
Like, how long, Dad?

23:38.939 --> 23:42.352
Say, uh, till after the election?

23:43.411 --> 23:46.500
And if you leave or get expelled,

23:46.580 --> 23:48.890
there will be a warrant out for your arrest.

23:51.752 --> 23:53.808
I have to go now.

23:57.925 --> 24:01.372
- You think he'll stay?
- He has no choice.

24:17.278 --> 24:18.814
Hey.

24:19.814 --> 24:21.402
Hey.

24:21.482 --> 24:25.439
- You making a break for it?
- What makes you say that?

24:27.922 --> 24:29.543
Where you headed?

24:29.623 --> 24:32.194
- Anywhere but here.
- Really?

24:33.561 --> 24:37.065
So, what, you'd be okay with, like, Iraq?

24:38.065 --> 24:40.187
Darfur?

24:40.267 --> 24:42.076
New Jersey?

24:43.771 --> 24:45.444
Maybe not Jersey.

24:48.476 --> 24:49.997
What are you doing out here?

24:50.077 --> 24:52.717
I'm on night watch.

24:53.914 --> 24:56.036
You're on the staff?

24:56.116 --> 24:57.805
Why were you in group with everybody else?

24:57.885 --> 25:00.408
Well, I was just there as an observer.

25:00.488 --> 25:02.900
I mean, I introduced myself,
but I guess you were out of it.

25:05.826 --> 25:07.601
I'm gonna have to report this, you know?

25:15.703 --> 25:17.758
Okay, that wasn't funny.

25:17.838 --> 25:21.529
- It was a little funny.
- Yeah, you're the next Moms Mabley.

25:21.609 --> 25:23.697
Who's that?

25:23.777 --> 25:26.367
Oh, she's an old black comedian.
She died in the '70s.

25:26.447 --> 25:31.005
Oh, yeah, that's me, old, black, and dead.

25:31.085 --> 25:32.940
Yeah, she got me through, like...

25:33.020 --> 25:35.476
like three months
at this shitty place in Utah.

25:35.556 --> 25:40.347
Her and, uh, George Carlin,
Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor.

25:40.827 --> 25:42.016
Lord Buckley.

25:42.096 --> 25:44.385
What, you're some kind of comedy expert?

25:45.465 --> 25:47.521
No, I'm just more of a fan.

25:47.601 --> 25:50.624
But, uh, I did do some open mics.

25:50.704 --> 25:52.684
How'd that go?

25:53.807 --> 25:57.113
I'm on a porch in rehab playing to a crowd
of one, how do you think it went?

26:19.033 --> 26:21.655
- That was you.
- Hmm?

26:21.735 --> 26:23.724
The cloves,
I smoked one at the table earlier.

26:23.804 --> 26:27.127
It was... stuck in the mesh.

26:27.207 --> 26:29.517
I smoked it.

26:32.379 --> 26:33.824
Well, look...

26:36.317 --> 26:38.038
Here you go.

26:38.118 --> 26:40.975
Full one for the road.

26:41.055 --> 26:44.111
You sure? It's your last one.

26:44.191 --> 26:45.829
Yeah, I've got another pack.

26:47.394 --> 26:49.032
Thanks.

26:55.536 --> 26:58.176
I get anxious here, too.

27:00.441 --> 27:02.229
Sterile white walls.

27:02.309 --> 27:03.880
Yeah.

27:05.012 --> 27:07.401
There's nothing there.

27:07.481 --> 27:09.518
Nothing but you.

27:12.285 --> 27:15.342
Come on, everybody, let's go. Two vans...

27:15.422 --> 27:17.611
Whoa, what are you two doing out here?

27:17.691 --> 27:20.900
Just having a smoke before the meeting.

27:22.129 --> 27:24.166
Let's go.

27:30.604 --> 27:33.642
Charlie, you coming?

27:35.109 --> 27:36.349
Yeah.

27:37.611 --> 27:39.800
I'm Daniel, and I'm an alcoholic.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.735
Hi, Daniel.

27:41.815 --> 27:44.305
I'm gonna be running tonight's meeting,

27:44.385 --> 27:46.440
but before we hear from our speaker,

27:46.520 --> 27:51.211
I'd like to hand out some chips
for various lengths of sobriety.

27:51.291 --> 27:55.082
Now, all of us have had
one day at some point.

27:55.162 --> 27:57.751
And maybe some of us still do.

27:57.831 --> 28:00.402
Are there any newcomers
who'd like to be recognized?

28:03.771 --> 28:05.417
Yeah.

28:08.442 --> 28:11.665
- Chase, alcoholic.
- Hi, Chase.

28:11.745 --> 28:14.602
I have 37 days, so technically,
I'm not a newcomer,

28:14.682 --> 28:17.771
but since we battle
this wily demon one day at a time,

28:17.851 --> 28:20.374
I can't help but feel like
a newcomer every day.

28:20.454 --> 28:23.010
So I wanna share
my experience, strength, and hope.

28:23.090 --> 28:25.661
Anybody with 30 days of sobriety?

28:28.095 --> 28:31.852
I know some of you see me
as a washed-up swashbuckler

28:31.932 --> 28:34.188
who got bored marauding the high seas,

28:34.268 --> 28:37.725
but I've lived all of
my adult life in California.

28:37.805 --> 28:40.394
And as I stand here,

28:40.474 --> 28:42.930
at the start of my campaign,

28:43.010 --> 28:45.299
I wanna let my opponent know that...

28:45.379 --> 28:48.835
"Yo, ho, ho, and the battle's begun."

28:50.184 --> 28:53.358
60 days? Anyone have 60 days?

28:56.657 --> 29:02.082
God grant me the serenity to accept
the things that I cannot change,

29:02.162 --> 29:04.785
the courage to change the things I can,

29:04.865 --> 29:07.471
and the wisdom to know the difference.

29:11.672 --> 29:13.994
- Hey, here you go.
- You gonna give Harper hell, Mr. Mills?

29:14.074 --> 29:16.363
- You bet.
- Oh, man, I love your work.

29:16.443 --> 29:18.265
- Thanks.
- Hey, can I get a selfie with you?

29:18.345 --> 29:20.518
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, this is great.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.205
- Oh, that's great. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:25.285 --> 29:26.840
When can we get outta here?

29:26.920 --> 29:29.810
I feel like we're all gonna be kidnapped
and forced to squeal like pigs.

29:29.890 --> 29:32.212
- Hey, how are ya?
- You have one more speech in Eureka,

29:32.292 --> 29:34.848
then it's San Jose,
San Luis Obispo, and Fresno.

29:34.928 --> 29:37.518
Wait, I thought we were going
back to L.A. before picking back up.

29:37.598 --> 29:39.253
- Hi.
- From here till the election,

29:39.333 --> 29:41.655
- it's pretty much wall-to-wall.
- This is very great.

29:41.735 --> 29:42.690
- Thank you so much.
- Hi.

29:42.770 --> 29:44.591
- Hi.
- Yes, but, uh, Charlie

29:44.671 --> 29:46.160
is getting out of in-patient.

29:46.240 --> 29:49.296
- You knew about these dates, honey.
- Yes, I know.

29:49.376 --> 29:50.597
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

29:50.677 --> 29:51.932
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
- Yes.

29:52.012 --> 29:54.635
But I, you know, there's, uh, family group

29:54.715 --> 29:57.938
at the new sober living house,
and I thought we should be there for him.

29:58.018 --> 29:59.807
- Hi.
- Don't do this to me.

29:59.887 --> 30:01.742
- Do what?
- Hi.

30:01.822 --> 30:04.611
If you want, I can arrange
for you to fly back.

30:04.691 --> 30:06.313
- Here you go, sir, you want a burger?
- Yes, please.

30:06.393 --> 30:07.347
There you go.

30:08.527 --> 30:12.019
- Yes?
- Hey, Drake, I'm all packed.

30:12.099 --> 30:15.239
- So anything I need to sign or what?
- Just a minute.

30:18.872 --> 30:21.261
Hey, I wanted to congratulate
you on moving forward

30:21.341 --> 30:23.630
to the next phase of
your Changes Ahead treatment program.

30:23.710 --> 30:25.065
Thank you.

30:25.145 --> 30:27.134
Now, uh, where are those dotted lines, huh?

30:27.214 --> 30:28.802
Hold on, hold on, all right?
We gotta debrief.

30:28.882 --> 30:31.705
- It's part of our discharge procedure.
- Great.

30:31.785 --> 30:33.924
Debrief the shit out of me.

30:35.422 --> 30:38.912
Okay, um, do you have someone responsible

30:38.992 --> 30:42.049
to transport you to
our sober living facility?

30:42.129 --> 30:44.384
- Absolutely.
- # Come on, fuck it #

30:44.464 --> 30:45.419
# Pass the blunt #

30:45.499 --> 30:47.654
# Come on, motherfucker,
said pass the blunt #

30:47.734 --> 30:50.476
- He's very responsible.
- Fine.

30:51.471 --> 30:53.727
If you'll just sign here, and you're all set.

30:53.807 --> 30:55.844
Okey-dokey.

30:57.578 --> 30:59.566
Well, it's been real, Drake.

30:59.646 --> 31:01.401
You, uh, have fun
holding down the fort, okay?

31:01.481 --> 31:03.470
Oh, I will, Charlie,
and unless you're a speed reader,

31:03.550 --> 31:05.973
I'm sure you missed the part
about fraternizing

31:06.053 --> 31:09.676
with people from this facility and how
it applies to when you leave here as well.

31:09.756 --> 31:11.278
- Yeah, shouldn't be a problem.
- Good, good.

31:11.358 --> 31:13.981
But just in case, I went ahead
and let your, uh, sober living house

31:14.061 --> 31:17.217
know about your friendship with Eva.

31:17.297 --> 31:19.486
I let her house know as well.

31:19.566 --> 31:21.555
Friendship during sobriety, not a problem.

31:21.635 --> 31:24.091
Romance, however...

31:24.171 --> 31:26.059
tends to get in the way.

31:26.139 --> 31:30.063
But like you said, that, uh,
shouldn't be a problem, should it?

31:30.143 --> 31:31.965
Yeah, right.

31:32.045 --> 31:33.634
Good luck.

31:35.714 --> 31:39.706
- So, you're finally free. How do you feel?
- Actually, not that shitty.

31:39.786 --> 31:41.842
Can you just say "good" like a normal person?

31:41.922 --> 31:44.678
Normal people don't move into halfway houses.

31:44.758 --> 31:47.762
Let's get the fuck outta here!

31:50.130 --> 31:53.720
An all-girls halfway house.
I think you might be on to something.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.957
- You're an idiot.
- What? Pussy island.

31:57.037 --> 31:59.526
Dude, this is not some slutty sorority, okay?

31:59.606 --> 32:02.712
You don't just fall asleep with a boner
and wake up with a girl on top of you.

32:06.545 --> 32:07.701
She knows you're coming?

32:07.781 --> 32:09.102
- Yeah.
- You texted her?

32:09.182 --> 32:11.605
Yeah, yeah, I told her
I'd come by right after I got out.

32:11.685 --> 32:13.340
You told her you're making a beeline here?

32:13.420 --> 32:16.810
- Oh, dude, so desperate.
- Stop.

32:16.890 --> 32:18.378
- It's too eager.
- Stop.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.247
Can you just wait in the car? Please?

32:20.327 --> 32:22.316
Fine.

32:22.396 --> 32:23.684
Remember, less is more.

32:23.764 --> 32:25.619
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

32:25.699 --> 32:28.255
Yeah, uh, I'm just...
I'm looking for somebody.

32:28.335 --> 32:31.992
- Are you Charlie?
- Yeah.

32:32.072 --> 32:34.862
- Eva will see you at a meeting.
- No, I just wanted to say hi...

32:34.942 --> 32:36.649
Have a great day.

32:38.145 --> 32:40.367
Fat fucking whale!

32:40.447 --> 32:42.654
Hey!

32:43.917 --> 32:45.939
You know, you shouldn't talk
about whales like that,

32:46.019 --> 32:47.521
they're an endangered species.

32:48.789 --> 32:51.861
- Go around and wait for me, okay?
- Yeah?

32:58.966 --> 33:00.468
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:03.103 --> 33:04.691
Who's that?

33:04.771 --> 33:07.761
Oh, that is my piece-of-shit best friend.

33:07.841 --> 33:10.412
Well, I thought I was your best friend.

33:11.912 --> 33:15.068
- You're such the comedian.
- Just fucking with you.

33:15.148 --> 33:18.972
So, are you gonna break me out of here?

33:19.052 --> 33:21.475
Well, I thought, um,

33:21.555 --> 33:25.379
now that we're both out of in-patient,
and... and we have some free time,

33:25.459 --> 33:28.615
and, you know, uh, I was just
thinking that maybe we could...

33:28.695 --> 33:30.684
I think...

33:30.764 --> 33:32.386
Can I have your number?

33:34.901 --> 33:39.192
God, our first time on free soil
and you're asking for my number?

33:39.272 --> 33:41.428
Yeah.

33:41.508 --> 33:43.749
What, what's the matter?
You don't wanna give it to me?

33:44.811 --> 33:46.882
Not now.

33:58.025 --> 34:00.062
Do you have a pen?

34:01.328 --> 34:04.151
- Tapping that must've been a nice perk.
- I haven't.

34:04.231 --> 34:05.352
- What?
- Yeah.

34:05.432 --> 34:07.754
What are you talking about?
Are you just not making the moves?

34:07.834 --> 34:09.956
No, no, no, no, no. It's a rehab thing.

34:10.036 --> 34:12.926
- Like, we'd get tossed.
- Oh.

34:13.005 --> 34:15.795
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

34:15.876 --> 34:17.597
Men fuck each other in prison all the time.

34:17.677 --> 34:18.799
- What's the harm?
- Right?

34:18.879 --> 34:22.469
- Yeah.
- It gets in the way of your recovery.

34:22.549 --> 34:24.538
Maybe they're trying to
motivate you, you know?

34:24.618 --> 34:26.672
I mean, fuck...

34:26.753 --> 34:29.962
I'd do all 12 steps in like a week
to hit skins with a girl like that.

34:30.791 --> 34:33.914
- You're an asshole.
- Why am I an asshole?

34:33.994 --> 34:36.216
Oh, because I wanna fuck your girlfriend?

34:36.295 --> 34:37.583
Yeah, yeah, it might be that.

34:37.664 --> 34:42.723
Wake up at 6:30, then morning chores,
breakfast, then inspection.

34:42.803 --> 34:44.157
You miss anything, you get a mark.

34:44.237 --> 34:47.594
Being at out-patient comes with
more freedom but more responsibility.

34:47.674 --> 34:50.429
You can come and go
as long as you sign in and out.

34:50.510 --> 34:54.333
- So, I can just leave?
- To the gas station or the market,

34:54.414 --> 34:57.738
but there's a 10:00 curfew,
and you'll be given random urine tests.

34:57.818 --> 35:00.407
- And if you fail...
- You'll keep it between us, right?

35:00.487 --> 35:02.042
Yeah?

35:02.122 --> 35:03.810
If you work hard and follow the rules,

35:03.890 --> 35:07.581
in about a month, you'll be eligible
for an overnight pass.

35:07.661 --> 35:10.217
Okay. Um...

35:10.297 --> 35:13.286
- there's still group, though, right?
- Every day at out-patient.

35:13.366 --> 35:15.455
And who attends these, uh, groups?

35:15.535 --> 35:17.057
What do you mean? Everybody.

35:17.137 --> 35:18.925
- Everybody?
- Yeah.

35:19.005 --> 35:21.228
- Eva's included in "everybody."
- I didn't mean that.

35:21.308 --> 35:23.363
You know, it's just good
to get different opinions.

35:23.443 --> 35:25.032
You can look but you can't touch.

35:25.112 --> 35:26.767
You'll be rooming with Jimmy.

35:26.847 --> 35:30.003
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Hey. Nothing much.

35:30.083 --> 35:33.440
- Remember, Charlie, wake up at 6:30.
- All right.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.509
Enjoy.

35:37.189 --> 35:39.012
Enjoy...

35:39.092 --> 35:42.349
So, uh, tell me.

35:42.429 --> 35:44.284
How shitty is this place?

35:44.364 --> 35:46.086
Compared to where we just were,
it's somewhat shitty.

35:46.166 --> 35:48.021
- Yeah?
- We got family group tomorrow,

35:48.101 --> 35:50.890
- which is gonna suck.
- Oh, your mom coming?

35:50.970 --> 35:52.325
Yeah.

35:52.405 --> 35:54.327
And they got this talent show thing
this weekend.

35:54.407 --> 35:56.529
Oh, thank God I made it for that.

35:57.734 --> 36:00.367
- Charlie!
- Hey, Paul.

36:01.247 --> 36:03.036
You dirtbag.

36:03.116 --> 36:04.738
Hey, you're lucky they put you in with Jimmy.

36:04.818 --> 36:06.740
I had Chase.

36:06.820 --> 36:08.809
Chase? Oh, yeah, Chase.

36:08.889 --> 36:11.978
- Um, alcoholic.
- Experience, strength, and hope.

36:12.058 --> 36:14.848
- He's gone, though.
- Oh, what happened?

36:14.928 --> 36:17.350
Looking to score,
but didn't want to get tossed,

36:17.430 --> 36:20.187
so he punched a cement wall
and broke his hand.

36:20.267 --> 36:22.656
He thought he'd get some pain killers,
but all they gave him was Advil.

36:22.736 --> 36:24.791
So he flipped out and split.

36:24.871 --> 36:26.326
Huh.

36:26.406 --> 36:28.795
Well, I guess his program
lost some of its rigor.

36:28.875 --> 36:31.164
I guess so.

36:31.244 --> 36:33.600
Now I'm stuck with Dylan.

36:33.680 --> 36:36.269
That guy jacks off right in front of me.

36:36.349 --> 36:37.537
Like I'm not even there.

36:37.617 --> 36:39.773
How do you deal with that?

36:39.853 --> 36:43.210
I guess you just gotta "accept
the things you cannot change," right?

36:43.290 --> 36:44.769
I guess so.

36:51.777 --> 36:54.536
Shit. Western Civ.

36:57.737 --> 37:00.594
- Hey, Adam.
- How's my favorite degenerate?

37:00.674 --> 37:02.929
Uh, really good.

37:03.009 --> 37:05.232
- Got any plans this weekend?
- Not really.

37:05.312 --> 37:07.767
Actually, um, there's
a talent show this Friday,

37:07.847 --> 37:10.303
- and some asshole signed me up.
- You gonna do stand-up?

37:10.383 --> 37:12.973
- Fuck no.
- You are doing stand-up,

37:13.053 --> 37:14.608
and I'm coming. Text me the address.

37:14.688 --> 37:17.310
- I will do no such thing.
- You will do just such a thing,

37:17.390 --> 37:19.813
and I will see you Friday night.

37:22.495 --> 37:24.784
I don't know what I did wrong.

37:24.864 --> 37:27.621
I tried to be a good mom.

37:27.701 --> 37:31.057
When he was young, his teachers loved him.

37:31.137 --> 37:33.960
Said he lit up the classroom.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.563
And then...

37:36.643 --> 37:40.734
all my hopes, my dreams...

37:40.814 --> 37:42.851
shattered.

37:44.117 --> 37:48.074
What have I ever done to you...

37:48.154 --> 37:51.811
but love you?

37:51.891 --> 37:56.033
Jimmy, do you have anything
you'd like to say to that?

37:58.531 --> 38:00.791
Not really.

38:01.901 --> 38:05.058
Thank you for being so open
and sharing, Cathy.

38:05.138 --> 38:07.243
Thank you.

38:09.042 --> 38:12.853
- Cathy, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

38:13.213 --> 38:15.202
I just relate to what Cathy was saying.

38:15.282 --> 38:17.204
Of course.

38:17.284 --> 38:19.439
The crying Cathys.

38:19.519 --> 38:23.899
Dylan, I'm so glad that both
of your moms could be here today.

38:32.265 --> 38:35.622
Well, it's not so bad.
It's a little like a fraternity.

38:35.702 --> 38:38.225
Yeah, yeah, you can just pretend
that I'm in college.

38:38.305 --> 38:40.760
Charlie, that's not what I was saying.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.877
I know, I know.

38:44.678 --> 38:47.901
- Travis seems nice.
- Yeah, yeah, he's really cool.

38:47.981 --> 38:51.204
Uh, he says that if I work really hard
that I can get an overnight pass.

38:51.284 --> 38:52.872
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah.

38:52.952 --> 38:55.976
But both you and Dad have to sign off on it.

38:56.056 --> 38:58.345
Well, if Travis says it's okay,

38:58.425 --> 39:00.632
then I don't see why Dad
would have a problem with it.

39:01.695 --> 39:03.950
- Could you talk to him?
- Sure.

39:04.030 --> 39:06.806
- Thanks.
- Of course.

39:08.234 --> 39:11.358
So, what have you been up to?

39:11.438 --> 39:13.693
Uh, you know.

39:13.773 --> 39:15.762
Same old campaign stuff.

39:15.842 --> 39:19.847
Boring speeches
and a lot of nodding and smiling.

39:22.482 --> 39:25.138
But what about you?
Have you made any friends here?

39:25.218 --> 39:27.741
Yeah, yeah, I made, um...

39:27.821 --> 39:29.676
I've gotten pretty close
with a couple of the guys.

39:29.756 --> 39:31.793
- That's good.
- Yeah.

39:32.992 --> 39:35.282
What is that? I...

39:35.362 --> 39:38.775
Oh, that. Uh, that is the number
of my new dealer.

39:40.633 --> 39:42.389
- Funny.
- Yeah.

39:42.469 --> 39:44.057
- Uh-huh.
- No, it's just...

39:44.137 --> 39:45.759
it's somebody that I met.

39:45.839 --> 39:47.876
Is this someone a girl?

39:49.509 --> 39:52.032
- Aha. What's her name?
- Eva.

39:52.112 --> 39:53.266
- Eva.
- Yeah.

39:53.346 --> 39:55.101
And when do we get to meet this Eva?

39:55.181 --> 39:58.605
- Uh...
- All right, everyone.

39:58.685 --> 40:00.307
It's time to say your good-byes.

40:00.387 --> 40:02.776
- I gotta go.
- No, yeah.

40:02.856 --> 40:04.944
Wait, Charlie, Charlie.

40:05.024 --> 40:06.479
I love you.

40:06.559 --> 40:08.937
- I love you, too, Mom.
- Okay.

40:09.996 --> 40:12.986
- All right, see ya.
- Uh-huh.

40:13.066 --> 40:15.103
- Talk to Dad.
- I will.

40:26.613 --> 40:29.202
Do you feel a connection?

40:29.282 --> 40:31.271
Yeah, I think I just stepped in it.

40:31.351 --> 40:33.273
Interesting.

40:33.353 --> 40:35.560
Tell me more about that.

40:36.689 --> 40:38.244
Okay, class,

40:38.324 --> 40:42.602
take a deep breath in
and move into downward dog.

40:45.765 --> 40:48.288
Perfect.

40:48.368 --> 40:49.923
Jimmy...

40:50.003 --> 40:53.560
- What are you doing?
- I'm focusing on my breathing.

40:53.640 --> 40:58.055
Son, you've been nothing
but a disappointment to me.

41:01.214 --> 41:05.094
Charlie, what do you want to say to your dad?

41:06.119 --> 41:08.408
I don't know.

41:08.488 --> 41:10.610
Fuck you?

41:10.690 --> 41:11.644
Eva.

41:11.724 --> 41:13.346
Okay, quick check in.

41:13.426 --> 41:15.749
- Charlie, how's it going?
- Really good, actually.

41:15.829 --> 41:18.118
I feel like I'm, um,
I'm finally turning a corner.

41:18.198 --> 41:19.953
That's great.

41:20.033 --> 41:21.788
Dylan.

41:21.868 --> 41:23.857
Not bad.

41:23.937 --> 41:25.959
I got my Internet privileges reinstated,

41:26.039 --> 41:29.418
and my roommate was gone this weekend,
so I had a lot of alone time.

41:31.611 --> 41:33.648
Okay, okay, that's enough.

41:35.581 --> 41:37.418
Eva?

41:41.621 --> 41:44.144
Um...

41:44.224 --> 41:45.812
I don't know.

41:45.892 --> 41:47.981
It's okay.

41:48.061 --> 41:50.098
This is a safe place.

41:57.737 --> 41:59.926
It's just...

42:00.006 --> 42:03.229
I thought that once I got out of in-patient

42:03.309 --> 42:06.256
that things were gonna feel a lot better.

42:10.783 --> 42:12.820
But they don't.

42:17.290 --> 42:20.947
A priest, a rabbi, and a minister,
they're are on a sinking ship, right?

42:21.027 --> 42:23.683
And the rabbi gets up and he says,

42:23.763 --> 42:26.352
"Hey, let the women and children go first."

42:26.432 --> 42:28.721
And the minister gets up,
he says, "Fuck the children."

42:28.801 --> 42:31.357
And the priest gets up
and looks at his watch, and he says,

42:31.437 --> 42:33.293
- "Do you think there's time?"
- I don't get it.

42:33.373 --> 42:36.529
- Really fucked up.
- Hey.

42:36.609 --> 42:38.465
Hey, Eva. Hey.

42:38.545 --> 42:41.267
Hey.

42:41.347 --> 42:43.384
What's going on?

42:44.984 --> 42:47.430
- Nothing.
- Talk to me.

42:48.555 --> 42:50.159
I can't.

42:52.559 --> 42:54.505
Why?

42:59.432 --> 43:01.469
I don't want to.

43:04.704 --> 43:06.877
Okay.

43:09.275 --> 43:12.131
Hey, some... some idiot signed me up
for the talent show tomorrow night.

43:12.211 --> 43:15.201
He, uh, ahem...

43:15.281 --> 43:17.570
I tried to take my name off the list
but they wouldn't let me.

43:18.950 --> 43:21.073
I don't think I'm gonna do it, though.

43:21.653 --> 43:23.409
You should.

43:23.568 --> 43:25.435
Why?

43:26.492 --> 43:28.648
Because it would make me happy.

43:28.728 --> 43:31.251
Come on.

43:31.331 --> 43:34.387
Doesn't this make you happy?

43:34.467 --> 43:35.922
This...

43:36.002 --> 43:37.857
I mean, what...
what the fuck is this, Charlie?

43:37.937 --> 43:39.592
It's so... it's so retarded.

43:39.672 --> 43:41.709
It's like we're in fucking middle school.

43:43.309 --> 43:44.811
Come on.

43:52.051 --> 43:54.140
We need to get an overnight pass.

43:54.220 --> 43:56.723
I'm trying.

43:58.825 --> 44:00.236
Try harder.

44:01.260 --> 44:03.583
# Crying on the corner, waiting in the rain #

44:03.663 --> 44:06.586
# I swear I'd never, ever wait again #

44:06.666 --> 44:11.891
# You gave me your word,
but words for you are lies #

44:11.971 --> 44:14.627
# Darling, in my wildest dreams #

44:14.707 --> 44:18.498
# I never thought I'd go home #

44:18.578 --> 44:21.134
# Talking 'bout trickle-down economics #

44:21.214 --> 44:25.138
# If it weren't so tragic,
it would be comic #

44:44.837 --> 44:46.459
Okay, thank you.

44:46.539 --> 44:48.227
Thank you.

44:48.307 --> 44:50.697
- It's such bravery...
- Come on.

44:50.777 --> 44:53.099
...being shown here tonight.

44:53.179 --> 44:55.168
Um, okay.

44:55.248 --> 44:57.737
- Who's next?
- Charlie, just go.

44:57.817 --> 44:59.005
- No.
- You gotta.

44:59.085 --> 45:03.343
Remember that is, uh...
uh, nonthreatening place

45:03.423 --> 45:07.132
where you can explore and express yourself.

45:09.462 --> 45:11.217
Charlie.

45:11.297 --> 45:12.719
Charlie Mills...

45:12.799 --> 45:14.053
- Come on.
- I'm not gonna do it.

45:14.133 --> 45:15.588
- You have to. You have to.
- I'm not gonna do it.

45:15.668 --> 45:17.557
- Why do you want me to do it so bad?
- I signed you up.

45:17.637 --> 45:19.674
Charlie?

45:29.449 --> 45:31.204
Hi, everybody.

45:31.284 --> 45:34.173
Ahem. You know, I was a little nervous

45:34.253 --> 45:37.210
getting up here today when I heard
it was gonna be a talent show.

45:37.290 --> 45:39.979
But after watching you all,
I feel a whole lot better.

45:40.059 --> 45:41.914
Now, I'm not trying to be critical.

45:41.994 --> 45:45.284
I know it's hard, but now I understand
why you all do drugs.

45:45.364 --> 45:47.420
I know what you're thinking, I do.

45:47.500 --> 45:49.956
You know, who is this kid
with the silver spoon in his mouth,

45:50.036 --> 45:52.158
and why does he keep cooking heroin in it?

45:52.238 --> 45:53.979
Total waste of a good utensil.

45:55.742 --> 45:58.520
So, yeah, my dad's a piece of shit.

45:58.845 --> 46:01.467
Uh, yeah, I mean, he...

46:01.547 --> 46:03.788
I don't really have a joke there.
I just wanted to say it.

46:05.251 --> 46:07.740
As you all know, he's running for governor.

46:07.820 --> 46:10.176
It's a big deal.
He's hanging up the old eye patch

46:10.256 --> 46:12.045
for, uh, you know, the governor's mansion.

46:12.125 --> 46:14.180
You know, and I hear a lot of people
these days on the news,

46:14.260 --> 46:16.049
they're telling that he's cold, he's distant,

46:16.129 --> 46:18.251
he's not really there,
but, you know, I'll tell you right now,

46:18.331 --> 46:20.887
that's not true. It's not.

46:20.967 --> 46:23.423
His mother was the only woman
in medical history

46:23.503 --> 46:25.324
to have an igloo for a pussy,
but that's not relevant.

46:25.404 --> 46:26.926
Excuse... excuse me!

46:27.006 --> 46:29.062
Do you think that works for this situation?

46:29.142 --> 46:33.566
Really, Shelia, Dylan just recited a haiku
that was clearly about his penis, okay?

46:33.646 --> 46:36.135
- We don't know that.
- Uh, I think we do.

46:36.215 --> 46:39.439
But I'm not here to talk about
other people's penises, okay?

46:39.519 --> 46:40.940
I'm here to talk about my own.

46:41.020 --> 46:44.510
Now, um, as you all know, when you
enter rehab, you get strip searched.

46:44.590 --> 46:46.512
And if I had known that
that would be the last time

46:46.592 --> 46:49.182
that anybody would touch my balls,
I would've tried to enjoy it more.

46:49.262 --> 46:51.117
All right, you're done. You're done.

46:51.197 --> 46:54.253
Uh, and there's this beautiful couch
in the halfway house,

46:54.333 --> 46:59.092
this soft, plush leather, and if I don't
get action soon, I'm gonna fuck it.

46:59.172 --> 47:02.161
I'm gonna fuck that couch, all right?

47:02.241 --> 47:05.298
- Okay, that's enough.
- Oh, Sheila, looking a little winded.

47:05.378 --> 47:06.866
You gotta try meth, okay?

47:06.946 --> 47:08.901
It's bad for the complexion,
you kinda lose your mind,

47:08.981 --> 47:11.404
but it's great for keeping
the old weight down.

47:11.484 --> 47:13.973
Hey! That is entirely inappropriate.

47:14.053 --> 47:16.442
- Inappropriate? In this crowd, Drake?
- Yeah.

47:16.522 --> 47:19.278
Listen, raise your hand
if you ever sold your ass for drugs.

47:19.358 --> 47:20.564
Huh?

47:28.201 --> 47:31.324
- You were funny, man.
- Thanks.

47:31.404 --> 47:35.862
I can't publically endorse what you did,
but you got something.

47:35.942 --> 47:39.232
- It's not for everybody.
- It's for you.

47:39.312 --> 47:41.314
Just being up there.

47:42.315 --> 47:43.503
I don't know.

47:43.583 --> 47:45.104
Yeah, you do.

47:45.184 --> 47:48.074
You just gotta stay focused.
Keep doing what you're doing.

47:48.154 --> 47:50.877
You've been killing it since you got here.

47:50.957 --> 47:53.780
- Thanks, man.
- You know, I'm actually considering

47:53.860 --> 47:55.381
giving you an overnight.

47:55.461 --> 47:57.683
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:57.763 --> 48:01.454
But the Sheila fat jokes are gonna
cost you toilet duty for a week.

48:06.005 --> 48:09.034
You're really getting in there, dude.

48:09.775 --> 48:12.532
- Gotta embrace the work.
- I don't know.

48:12.612 --> 48:15.802
As a recovering junkie,
I'm pretty hesitant to get on my knees.

48:15.882 --> 48:19.105
Hey, unlike you,
that does not bring back any memories.

48:19.185 --> 48:20.873
Hey, I never sucked dick.

48:20.953 --> 48:23.242
Good for you.

48:23.322 --> 48:26.428
Some guy did blow me once, though.

48:28.794 --> 48:30.705
What, it was for some H.

48:32.265 --> 48:34.754
Some guy sucked your dick for heroin?

48:34.834 --> 48:36.856
Sure, why is it such a big deal? I'm not gay.

48:36.936 --> 48:38.291
I was desperate.

48:38.371 --> 48:43.462
But you gave some guy heroin
to suck your dick, so technically...

48:43.542 --> 48:44.764
Wait, no, no, no, no.

48:44.844 --> 48:46.599
He gave me the H.

48:46.679 --> 48:48.134
I was jonesing.

48:48.214 --> 48:50.353
Oh.

48:53.552 --> 48:55.074
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

48:55.154 --> 48:57.743
It was a fucked up time,
and I'm not proud of it.

48:57.823 --> 48:59.478
Ho... Wait, hold on, hold on.

48:59.558 --> 49:02.315
Some guy gave you heroin to suck your dick?

49:02.395 --> 49:04.550
- Yeah, it's not that complicated.
- But...

49:04.630 --> 49:07.353
- Addiction is a disease, man.
- No, I get why you did it.

49:07.433 --> 49:09.522
I get what you got out of it,
but what does he get out of it?

49:09.602 --> 49:11.673
Fuck if I know.

49:14.640 --> 49:17.530
I can't believe I'm saying this, but
that doesn't sound like such a bad deal.

49:17.610 --> 49:20.833
Yeah, if you close your eyes
and think of Jessica Alba,

49:20.913 --> 49:23.325
it's really not that much of a difference.

49:25.751 --> 49:28.664
- Although, he had like this goatee...
- Stop.

49:29.655 --> 49:33.212
- Yo, Travis, do you think it's gay...
- If you gotta ask, the answer's yes.

49:36.028 --> 49:38.718
- Good work, Charlie.
- Thanks.

49:38.798 --> 49:40.987
What the hell are you doing?

49:41.067 --> 49:42.688
I get more leverage when I use my foot.

49:42.768 --> 49:46.025
- That's a mark right there.
- Fuck.

49:46.105 --> 49:47.894
One more week of this shit.

49:47.974 --> 49:51.217
- Maybe if you let him blow you...
- Fuck you.

49:55.047 --> 49:57.870
So, I spoke to Charlie's counselor.

49:57.950 --> 50:03.276
And, um, according to the house manager,
he has been a model member.

50:03.356 --> 50:05.344
- He got an...
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

50:05.424 --> 50:07.880
Mr. Mills, I just wanna shake your hand.

50:07.960 --> 50:09.415
- Thank you.
- Hi.

50:09.495 --> 50:12.184
- We... we're all pulling for you.
- Appreciate it.

50:12.264 --> 50:15.288
- And I'm a big fan of your films.
- Thank you so much.

50:15.368 --> 50:18.057
"Yo, ho, ho, and the battle begun."

50:19.308 --> 50:20.605
Yeah.

50:20.705 --> 50:22.862
- Thank you, man.
- You got it. Take care.

50:22.942 --> 50:26.198
Willow, I told you, he's just a regular guy.

50:26.278 --> 50:28.234
Gotta love those likely voters.

50:28.314 --> 50:30.870
Mm.

50:30.950 --> 50:34.073
- So, as I was saying...
- Yeah.

50:34.153 --> 50:35.775
...I spoke to Charlie's counselor,

50:35.855 --> 50:39.478
and they are inclined to give him
an overnight pass this weekend,

50:39.558 --> 50:42.048
- but we both have to sign off on it.
- Yeah, yeah.

50:42.128 --> 50:44.884
No, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea, honey.

50:44.964 --> 50:46.252
Why not?

50:46.332 --> 50:49.288
Well, because we're only
three weeks away from the election.

50:49.368 --> 50:51.190
He's been sober for months.

50:51.270 --> 50:54.080
Honey, just three weeks.

50:57.176 --> 51:01.090
Well, I already told him
we would sign off on it.

51:02.581 --> 51:04.870
- What?
- Yeah.

51:04.950 --> 51:05.972
- Honey, honey.
- How many more times

51:06.052 --> 51:10.242
- do we have to talk about this?
- He is even more handsome in person.

51:10.322 --> 51:13.713
- Oh, look at those eyes.
- Thank you. Thank you.

51:13.793 --> 51:16.248
- What the fuck, man?
- I just sent it to a few friends.

51:16.328 --> 51:18.284
- Fuck.
- This girl I've been seeing is on

51:18.364 --> 51:21.620
this student activity thing
that books comics for college shows.

51:21.700 --> 51:23.122
- She loved you.
- Great, great.

51:23.202 --> 51:25.324
I'm glad some random girl
you're boning thinks I'm funny.

51:25.404 --> 51:27.893
- I can die happy now.
- I thought I was helping.

51:27.973 --> 51:29.128
You're not helping.

51:29.208 --> 51:31.464
I was think fucking close
to getting an overnight with Eva.

51:31.544 --> 51:33.632
And if this video gets out, it's done.

51:33.712 --> 51:35.968
Sorry, man. Fuck, I didn't think about that.

51:36.048 --> 51:37.136
It's all right.

51:37.216 --> 51:40.239
I just... I worked really hard for this.

51:40.319 --> 51:43.075
Well, a wise man once said,

51:43.155 --> 51:45.396
"Work makes you free."

51:47.293 --> 51:49.281
Pretty sure the Nazis said that.

51:49.361 --> 51:51.317
No, I heard it in class.

51:51.397 --> 51:53.552
It was first said by
a German writer in the 1800s

51:53.632 --> 51:55.321
about the cleansing nature of work.

51:55.401 --> 51:58.524
And the Nazis put that shit
on a big sign outside Auschwitz.

51:58.604 --> 52:00.259
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:00.339 --> 52:02.861
The Nazis stole all the good ideas.

52:09.515 --> 52:11.637
- Dad.
- Hey, Charlie.

52:11.717 --> 52:13.973
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

52:14.053 --> 52:17.610
Yeah, um, listen, are you with Mom?

52:17.690 --> 52:20.146
No, she, uh, she went out. Why?

52:20.226 --> 52:21.614
Uh, well, just...

52:21.694 --> 52:23.816
Look, there's this pass that
I've been meaning to talk to you about.

52:23.896 --> 52:27.720
- My house manager says...
- Yeah, that's what I wanted to discuss.

52:27.800 --> 52:30.022
I don't think it's such
a good idea right now.

52:30.102 --> 52:32.658
You need more time.

52:32.738 --> 52:34.627
No, Dad, I think you need more time.

52:34.707 --> 52:36.778
Have a great fucking day! Fuck!

52:40.446 --> 52:43.836
- Hey, brother in recovery.
- Hey.

52:43.916 --> 52:47.125
You up for some fellowship?

52:48.154 --> 52:50.910
Got my pass. I got it.

52:50.990 --> 52:52.678
I got this cousin Marie to sign off on it.

52:52.758 --> 52:55.781
- I'm all yours.
- Eva, wait.

52:55.861 --> 52:57.950
- Stop, please.
- God, I want you to fuck me.

52:58.030 --> 53:00.653
Stop, Eva, stop.

53:00.733 --> 53:03.756
- I didn't get it.
- What?

53:03.836 --> 53:06.025
I didn't get the pass.
My dad pulled the plug.

53:06.105 --> 53:08.142
What are you talking about?

53:10.576 --> 53:12.681
Charlie, I can't do this.

53:14.180 --> 53:16.235
- I just can't do this...
- Come on, don't say that.

53:16.315 --> 53:18.352
Stop.

53:20.386 --> 53:23.175
- We have nothing.
- That's not true.

53:23.255 --> 53:25.644
It's not true.

53:25.724 --> 53:27.294
Yeah, that's right.

53:28.527 --> 53:30.302
We have our sobriety.

53:33.766 --> 53:36.922
A Jewish fella and a Chinaman
were standing on the corner

53:37.002 --> 53:40.192
talking about who
the greatest man that ever lived.

53:40.272 --> 53:42.094
An Irishman walked up.

53:42.174 --> 53:46.499
He said, "If you tell me who the greatest man
that ever lived, I'll give you $500 in cash."

53:46.579 --> 53:48.968
Little Chinaman said, "Chiang Kai-shek."

53:49.048 --> 53:50.402
He said, "Nah."

53:50.482 --> 53:52.972
Little Jewish fellow said, "St. Patrick."

53:53.052 --> 53:54.373
He said, "You're right."

53:54.453 --> 53:57.376
Reached his hand in his pocket,
give him the $500 and walked away.

53:57.456 --> 54:00.045
Little Jewish fella looked at the $500.

54:00.125 --> 54:04.116
He said, "I had Moses in mine,
but business is business."

54:15.941 --> 54:18.531
Charlie. Charlie.

54:18.611 --> 54:21.867
- Wake up, man.
- No.

54:21.947 --> 54:25.671
- What'd you say?
- Scrub your own fucking toilets.

54:25.751 --> 54:27.640
What the hell are you talking about?

54:27.720 --> 54:30.843
- It's your pass today.
- What?

54:30.923 --> 54:33.879
Yeah, you been riding me about
an overnight since you got here.

54:33.959 --> 54:35.381
Now you don't wanna leave?

54:35.461 --> 54:37.583
Your ride is outside. Come on.

54:37.663 --> 54:40.075
- What?
- Yeah.

54:48.274 --> 54:50.329
- Hey.
- Hi.

54:52.746 --> 54:56.602
- How'd you convince Dad?
- Hmm, so you're gonna need a place to stay.

54:56.682 --> 55:00.039
- How about the beach house?
- Why are you doing this?

55:00.119 --> 55:02.360
Because you earned it.

55:09.862 --> 55:12.518
Why don't you ever take me someplace nice?

55:12.598 --> 55:14.771
'Cause I don't like you that much.

55:19.672 --> 55:22.094
Wow.

55:22.174 --> 55:24.964
Gotta stab a lot of people
with fake swords to get this.

55:25.044 --> 55:26.832
Yeah.

55:27.212 --> 55:29.969
So, this is the living room.

55:30.049 --> 55:32.037
Uh, this is the kitchen.

55:32.117 --> 55:34.573
Uh, this is the deck out there.

55:34.653 --> 55:36.809
There's a sitting chair thing.

55:36.889 --> 55:38.978
Um, there's the beach.

55:39.058 --> 55:41.547
Do you want, uh, do you want
to go check out the ocean?

55:42.627 --> 55:45.700
Can we check it out from the bedroom?

55:59.178 --> 56:01.215
Jesus.

56:23.402 --> 56:24.923
That was great.

56:28.440 --> 56:30.829
I mean...

56:30.909 --> 56:33.799
a little quick, but...

56:33.879 --> 56:35.234
Just kidding.

56:37.883 --> 56:41.140
- Greatest 30 seconds of my life.
- Great.

56:41.220 --> 56:43.309
Yeah, glad you're having fun.

56:43.389 --> 56:45.665
I am.

56:48.927 --> 56:50.406
I am.

56:54.666 --> 56:57.289
You know what would be so great right now?

56:57.369 --> 56:59.406
What?

57:00.939 --> 57:02.941
A drink.

57:04.576 --> 57:07.352
I know what you mean.

57:08.747 --> 57:13.218
Didn't I see a wine rack in the kitchen?

57:15.954 --> 57:17.991
Are you serious?

57:19.024 --> 57:21.095
Why not?

57:24.363 --> 57:26.919
If we fail our urines, we get tossed.

57:26.999 --> 57:30.845
How many times have you
bragged to me about beating those?

57:32.604 --> 57:34.242
You're not having a good time?

57:38.177 --> 57:41.317
No, uh... I am.

57:42.681 --> 57:44.718
It's just...

57:51.089 --> 57:53.178
- You have a good time?
- Yeah.

57:53.258 --> 57:56.432
Wow, no sarcasm. There's a first.

57:58.831 --> 58:01.587
You haven't done any meth. No X.

58:01.667 --> 58:04.757
No barbiturates. No opiates. No coke.

58:04.837 --> 58:07.793
Should be proud sticking it out another day.

58:07.873 --> 58:11.755
Yeah, when can I hang my hat on
something more than just "sticking it out"?

58:13.045 --> 58:15.401
You haven't been on the street shooting dope.

58:15.481 --> 58:18.970
You can hang a hell of a lot more
than your hat on that.

58:21.269 --> 58:23.091
What if you still think about it?

58:23.171 --> 58:24.977
The cravings?

58:25.057 --> 58:27.513
That's all they are.

58:27.593 --> 58:29.214
As long as you don't act on them.

58:29.294 --> 58:31.183
They ever go away?

58:31.263 --> 58:35.754
Think of how hard it was for you scoring
drugs and maintaining that lifestyle.

58:35.834 --> 58:38.924
Why should this be any easier?
You gotta work.

58:39.004 --> 58:41.326
- I see other people...
- Oh, other people.

58:41.406 --> 58:43.362
Other peo...
You can't worry about other people.

58:43.442 --> 58:45.431
Especially other addicts.

58:45.511 --> 58:47.833
Getting sober is a selfish thing.

58:47.913 --> 58:49.468
Because getting high was selfish.

58:49.548 --> 58:51.870
Yeah, but I thought sobriety
was about helping people.

58:51.950 --> 58:53.338
Yes, it is.

58:53.418 --> 58:55.507
But you gotta help yourself first.

58:55.587 --> 58:57.876
If the plane's going down,

58:57.956 --> 59:01.914
you put your oxygen mask on first, right?

59:01.994 --> 59:05.117
I mean, you wouldn't go all
"Baywatch" on a drowning person

59:05.197 --> 59:07.920
if you don't know how to swim.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.037
You know how to swim, Charlie?

59:12.371 --> 59:16.128
You know, everyone keeps telling me
that he comes across cold and distant...

59:16.208 --> 59:18.197
What is this? What am I looking at?

59:18.277 --> 59:20.032
- It's Charlie...
- I know who it is.

59:20.112 --> 59:22.301
- I wanna know what it is.
- It's on the Internet, sir.

59:22.381 --> 59:24.803
It has over 50,000 hits.

59:24.883 --> 59:28.474
Are you telling me
over 50,000 people have seen this?

59:28.554 --> 59:31.743
- So far. It's growing.
- Take the goddamn thing down.

59:31.823 --> 59:34.046
Only the person who posted it can do that.

59:34.126 --> 59:36.448
This is beyond fucked!

59:36.528 --> 59:41.220
Uh, I mean, you could try reaching out
to "Raw Dogging It 15."

59:41.300 --> 59:42.335
I...

59:44.236 --> 59:46.291
Is the possible it could be
coming from the Harper campaign?

59:46.371 --> 59:48.260
There's no evidence of that, sir.

59:48.340 --> 59:49.995
This is a fucking disaster.

59:50.075 --> 59:53.298
We'll craft a response
and issue a press avail.

59:53.378 --> 59:55.790
Do it. Do it now.

59:56.782 --> 59:58.537
Fuck.

59:58.617 --> 01:00:00.906
I thought we were past
the whole waiting to text thing.

01:00:00.986 --> 01:00:02.941
Just be happy you're pulling
some ass in this place.

01:00:03.021 --> 01:00:05.477
- What if something happened to her?
- I hope something did happen to her.

01:00:05.557 --> 01:00:07.145
Then you'll actually
have something to complain about.

01:00:07.225 --> 01:00:09.581
- Morning. You guys good?
- Yeah.

01:00:09.661 --> 01:00:12.403
Group's in half an hour. Let's get a move on.

01:00:16.234 --> 01:00:18.423
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

01:00:18.503 --> 01:00:22.427
Uh, I have just come from a very
substantive and productive meeting

01:00:22.507 --> 01:00:23.962
with the head of the SEIU.

01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:28.166
And I am delighted to announce that
they have pledged their full support.

01:00:28.246 --> 01:00:30.135
I've always stood up for the workforce,

01:00:30.215 --> 01:00:33.472
and they know that I will stand
should-to-shoulder with them

01:00:33.552 --> 01:00:37.276
on living wages and good health
and retirement benefits.

01:00:37.356 --> 01:00:41.313
But I'm sure that, uh,
you're not all here for that reason.

01:00:41.393 --> 01:00:44.550
Many of you may have seen
a, uh, comedy performance

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:47.819
that my son did that has
been posted on the Internet.

01:00:47.899 --> 01:00:52.257
First of all, you should know that Charlie
had nothing to do with that posting.

01:00:52.337 --> 01:00:55.460
He was merely fooling around
and having some fun at a party.

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:59.464
He and I spoke earlier today,
and he is behind me 100%.

01:00:59.544 --> 01:01:01.833
And quite frankly,
I found some it pretty funny.

01:01:01.913 --> 01:01:04.303
Isn't it true your son has struggled
with substance abuse

01:01:04.383 --> 01:01:06.705
and is currently at a rehab facility
in Los Angeles?

01:01:06.785 --> 01:01:10.409
We have never tried to hide the fact
that Charlie has had his challenges,

01:01:10.489 --> 01:01:12.611
uh, but, no, he is not in rehab.

01:01:12.691 --> 01:01:15.747
Uh, I'm happy to report
he is sober and doing great.

01:01:15.827 --> 01:01:17.282
Thank you so much, thank you.

01:01:17.362 --> 01:01:19.051
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

01:01:19.131 --> 01:01:21.805
Mr. Mills has a meeting with the
Superintendent of Public Instruction.

01:01:24.268 --> 01:01:29.061
- Hey. Uh, you seen Eva?
- She was at the house last night.

01:01:29.141 --> 01:01:31.897
I mean, she should be here.

01:01:31.977 --> 01:01:34.800
Hey, man. Did you...
did you see your dad on the news?

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.736
He was talking about you.

01:01:37.816 --> 01:01:40.038
- Hey, you seen Eva?
- You haven't heard?

01:01:40.118 --> 01:01:44.343
- Heard what?
- She took off.

01:01:44.423 --> 01:01:47.245
- Took off? Wh... When?
- This morning.

01:01:47.325 --> 01:01:49.181
What the fuck? Why?

01:01:49.261 --> 01:01:51.070
Why do you think?

01:01:59.538 --> 01:02:01.360
Charlie! Come on, man.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.228
- Come on, talk to me.
- Say what?

01:02:03.308 --> 01:02:05.230
What do you want me to say, huh?
What can you say?

01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:06.865
You say it.

01:02:06.945 --> 01:02:08.700
- Say it, man.
- Say what?

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.702
Why are you doing this, huh?

01:02:10.782 --> 01:02:12.738
Say it! Be a man and tell me.

01:02:12.818 --> 01:02:15.741
You're about to throw everything away
and you can't even tell me why.

01:02:15.821 --> 01:02:17.109
Look, I know what you're gonna say.

01:02:17.189 --> 01:02:18.977
"Work the program," hmm?

01:02:19.057 --> 01:02:21.546
"One day at a time. Let go and let God."

01:02:21.626 --> 01:02:25.917
- What do I have that's mine?
- You got you, man.

01:02:25.997 --> 01:02:28.553
And that's all you'll ever have.

01:02:28.633 --> 01:02:30.589
You think drugs are gonna change that?

01:02:30.669 --> 01:02:33.158
Look, man, I'm not...
I'm not leaving for drugs.

01:02:33.238 --> 01:02:35.727
Leaving for a girl, is there a difference?

01:02:35.807 --> 01:02:39.464
Look, man, I just... I can't
stay here anymore, okay?

01:02:39.544 --> 01:02:40.799
This place, it's like a fucking prison.

01:02:40.879 --> 01:02:43.902
It's not even close.

01:02:43.982 --> 01:02:46.338
You see these?

01:02:46.418 --> 01:02:49.508
You think I got these
at a tattoo parlor in Hollywood?

01:02:49.588 --> 01:02:54.413
Be grateful it's 90 days here
and not two years in county.

01:02:54.493 --> 01:02:58.784
But don't worry, if you're not dead,
you'll probably end up there anyway.

01:02:58.864 --> 01:03:01.019
Look, I don't give a shit, okay?

01:03:01.099 --> 01:03:02.354
I don't. Fuck that, okay?

01:03:02.434 --> 01:03:05.891
If those charges in Utah
come back and bite me, so be it.

01:03:05.971 --> 01:03:07.893
What are you talking about?

01:03:07.973 --> 01:03:10.852
There's nothing in your files about charges.

01:03:16.515 --> 01:03:20.672
And the political season now is beginning
to heat up all over the country.

01:03:20.752 --> 01:03:24.634
With less than two weeks to the election,
the California governor's race...

01:03:26.691 --> 01:03:28.213
What the fuck was that?

01:03:28.293 --> 01:03:30.449
...and in Southern California,
as you can see,

01:03:30.529 --> 01:03:33.452
are showing a dead heat in many areas.

01:03:33.532 --> 01:03:36.455
The demographics are
what's gonna make the difference

01:03:36.535 --> 01:03:39.311
- in this gubernatorial race.
- Stay here.

01:04:03.528 --> 01:04:07.519
Oh, Jesus, Charlie.
What the fuck are you doing?

01:04:07.599 --> 01:04:09.588
Hey, Dad. It's great to see ya.

01:04:09.668 --> 01:04:11.623
- You know, I decided to stop by.
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:11.703 --> 01:04:12.724
Yeah.

01:04:12.804 --> 01:04:15.127
This is how you wanna live your life, huh?

01:04:15.207 --> 01:04:18.597
Messing things up so that Daddy
has to clean up after you?

01:04:18.677 --> 01:04:20.465
- Clean up after me?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:04:20.545 --> 01:04:23.135
If it's not smashing a church window,
it's stealing a car.

01:04:23.215 --> 01:04:26.838
If you're not stealing a car,
posting a video.

01:04:26.918 --> 01:04:29.241
- Video? What are you talking about?
- It's all over the fucking Internet.

01:04:29.321 --> 01:04:30.925
What, are you gonna deny that now?

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:34.246
- Adam.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

01:04:34.326 --> 01:04:36.148
Keep blaming other people for your shit.

01:04:36.228 --> 01:04:39.518
Why can't you just be honest
and own something for once?

01:04:39.598 --> 01:04:40.552
Honesty? Great.

01:04:40.632 --> 01:04:42.020
I'm really glad you brought that up, Dad.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.357
I am, because, um, I was never
a big fan of your pirate movies,

01:04:45.437 --> 01:04:50.562
but that sociopath you played on the phone
with that Utah bullshit, that was spot-on!

01:04:50.642 --> 01:04:52.030
- You left me no choice!
- Bravo!

01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:53.532
Oh, no choice?
You're gonna talk to me about choice?

01:04:53.612 --> 01:04:55.700
You've had plenty of
fucking choices, Charlie!

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:58.954
Yeah, rehab or jail.
You know, quite a wide selection there.

01:05:03.121 --> 01:05:05.123
We're really gonna do this?

01:05:15.967 --> 01:05:18.323
- Was... was that Charlie?
- Uh-huh.

01:05:18.403 --> 01:05:19.791
- Well, where's he going?
- I don't know.

01:05:19.871 --> 01:05:21.493
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I don't know. He didn't tell me.

01:05:21.573 --> 01:05:24.829
He just stole the car and took off.
Same old shit.

01:05:26.111 --> 01:05:29.100
Hey, it's Eva. Leave me a message.

01:05:31.749 --> 01:05:33.204
- Hello?
- Eva?

01:05:33.284 --> 01:05:36.007
- No. Who the fuck is this?
- Where'd you get this phone?

01:05:36.087 --> 01:05:37.843
- Some girl sold it to me.
- Where?

01:05:37.923 --> 01:05:40.712
- Hey, I bought it fair and square.
- Where the fuck did she sell it to you?

01:05:40.792 --> 01:05:42.881
- Venice.
- Where in Venice?

01:05:42.961 --> 01:05:45.883
I don't know. Somewhere on the boardwalk.

01:05:47.098 --> 01:05:48.620
No, I don't want him arrested.

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.388
Just, um, ahem.

01:05:50.468 --> 01:05:52.057
Just keep an eye on him.

01:05:52.137 --> 01:05:55.678
'Cause if anything does happen, obviously,
we need to know about it, right?

01:06:09.421 --> 01:06:13.245
Eva. Eva.

01:06:13.325 --> 01:06:15.814
Hey. Hey, don't run away.
Come on, give me a second.

01:06:15.894 --> 01:06:17.576
- Eva. Eva!
- What?

01:06:17.657 --> 01:06:19.985
Just look at me, all right?
Just give me a fucking minute, all right?

01:06:20.265 --> 01:06:23.321
Listen, you don't think I know
what you're going through?

01:06:23.401 --> 01:06:25.490
I've ditched 1,000 of these places.

01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:28.660
- It's different.
- Yeah, it's fucking different.

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.050
I love you.

01:06:33.878 --> 01:06:35.367
Really?

01:06:35.447 --> 01:06:37.836
So... so what, then?

01:06:37.916 --> 01:06:39.537
It's... it's us against the world?

01:06:39.617 --> 01:06:44.363
I get lost in you and you get lost in me
and we live happily ever after?

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.439
I can't outrun this.

01:06:53.498 --> 01:06:55.478
Come home with me.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.156
Now, with a political campaign
of this magnitude,

01:08:05.236 --> 01:08:07.292
it's gotta take some toll on your family.

01:08:07.372 --> 01:08:09.594
Well, I'm glad you asked
that question, Eddie.

01:08:09.674 --> 01:08:12.030
We wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think

01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:14.666
we could make a significant impact
on your education system,

01:08:14.746 --> 01:08:18.069
and ultimately, on the health
of our sagging economy.

01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:20.037
So can I ask how your son's holding up?

01:08:20.118 --> 01:08:22.173
- It's not been easy for him.
- You know, we-we-we spoke

01:08:22.252 --> 01:08:23.475
- to him earlier this morning.
- He's having a hard time.

01:08:23.555 --> 01:08:25.310
And he's doing just fine.

01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:27.645
All right, thank you so much
for joining us today.

01:08:27.725 --> 01:08:29.279
- Thank you.
- All right, you're watching

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.816
our exclusive interview
with David and Liseanne Mills.

01:08:31.895 --> 01:08:35.053
Just two weeks away from
California's gubernatorial election.

01:08:35.133 --> 01:08:38.490
For Fox 11 News, I'm Edward Barnes.
Back to you guys.

01:08:38.569 --> 01:08:40.072
All right, we're clear.

01:08:42.573 --> 01:08:45.162
They found Liseanne's SUV
at the Malibu house,

01:08:45.243 --> 01:08:47.665
- but no Charlie.
- Okay.

01:10:00.685 --> 01:10:02.774
I mean, what do you want me to do, huh?

01:10:02.854 --> 01:10:05.510
Personally search every crack house
and meth lab in the city?

01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:10.215
Every counselor, every therapist,
told us the same thing.

01:10:10.295 --> 01:10:13.284
- Mm-hmm.
- "Be strong! Hold the boundaries!"

01:10:13.364 --> 01:10:14.419
- Yes.
- That's what they told us!

01:10:14.499 --> 01:10:15.620
Did they also tell you to lie to your son?

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:16.921
- Oh, come on.
- Did they do that?

01:10:17.001 --> 01:10:20.558
- We've been through all that already.
- No, he came 1,000 miles with nothing!

01:10:20.638 --> 01:10:22.627
- And we turned him away!
- That's right!

01:10:22.707 --> 01:10:25.096
Yes, and you lied to him! And you lied to me!

01:10:25.176 --> 01:10:26.564
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes! Yes!

01:10:26.644 --> 01:10:28.967
Well, what do you call going behind my
back and giving him an overnight pass?

01:10:29.047 --> 01:10:30.468
- What do you call that?
- I love him!

01:10:30.548 --> 01:10:31.803
- I love him!
- Oh, and I don't love him?

01:10:31.883 --> 01:10:33.605
- I don't know!
- He's our son!

01:10:33.685 --> 01:10:36.207
Of course I fucking love him!

01:10:36.287 --> 01:10:39.427
One of us had to keep him safe.

01:10:40.592 --> 01:10:44.130
For him... or for you?

01:10:58.476 --> 01:11:00.732
I'm trying to sleep...

01:11:00.812 --> 01:11:02.655
Shut the fuck up.

01:11:03.648 --> 01:11:09.707
# I don't mind the sound #

01:11:09.787 --> 01:11:13.678
# Of your voice #

01:11:13.758 --> 01:11:16.932
# Of your voice #

01:11:18.029 --> 01:11:22.637
# When you use it like your gun #

01:11:23.901 --> 01:11:25.390
Hey, you awake?

01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:28.159
- # So much fun... #
- Yeah.

01:11:28.239 --> 01:11:30.762
Hey, you got enough to cut tonight?

01:11:34.412 --> 01:11:36.467
I don't know.

01:11:36.547 --> 01:11:38.636
It's kinda late, dude.

01:11:38.716 --> 01:11:41.356
I know a guy who's got some real fire.

01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:48.843
I'm down.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.400
# He strings himself on up
to your front door #

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:05.854
Get the money!

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:10.688
Get the money!

01:12:30.635 --> 01:12:32.637
Hello?

01:12:34.839 --> 01:12:36.794
Charlie?

01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:38.763
Is that you?

01:12:42.447 --> 01:12:44.602
Talk to me.

01:12:44.682 --> 01:12:46.389
Please.

01:12:56.928 --> 01:12:58.952
Adam!

01:13:00.465 --> 01:13:02.502
Come on!

01:13:04.469 --> 01:13:07.925
- Hey, man.
- What the fuck happened to you?

01:13:08.005 --> 01:13:09.780
Can I stay here?

01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:12.688
Fuck...

01:13:13.745 --> 01:13:16.067
Forget it, man. She's a bitch.

01:13:16.147 --> 01:13:18.536
- She's not a bitch.
- She is a bitch.

01:13:18.616 --> 01:13:21.773
She is a weak-willed bitch that left
you hanging with your dick in your hand.

01:13:21.853 --> 01:13:24.208
- You're better than that.
- Oh, yeah, I'm way better.

01:13:24.288 --> 01:13:27.745
I'm strung out, got no money,
and a fucked-up face.

01:13:27.825 --> 01:13:31.082
Why is the glass always
half fucking shattered with you?

01:13:32.196 --> 01:13:35.987
Fuck. Look, you can stay here
with me as long as you want, all right?

01:13:36.067 --> 01:13:38.589
We'll hit some parties, meet some ladies.

01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:39.991
- You can do whatever you want.
- Yeah.

01:13:40.071 --> 01:13:42.927
You know, just no heroin.
Think you can handle that?

01:13:43.307 --> 01:13:45.063
You bet.

01:13:45.143 --> 01:13:47.031
And you gotta cut this
sad-sack-of-shit routine.

01:13:47.111 --> 01:13:49.233
It is just total pussy repellent.

01:13:49.313 --> 01:13:51.302
Not to mention you smell
like a fat person's ass

01:13:51.382 --> 01:13:53.604
that's been wandering around
Disneyland all day.

01:13:53.684 --> 01:13:56.541
- I'll take a shower.
- Please, for the sake of mankind.

01:13:56.621 --> 01:13:59.043
- It is really pungent.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:59.123 --> 01:14:03.214
- Oh, God.
- Hey, remember, tomorrow's a new day.

01:14:03.294 --> 01:14:05.604
Oh, you think of that all by yourself?

01:14:37.662 --> 01:14:39.717
Yo. Hey.

01:14:39.797 --> 01:14:41.586
I'm gonna fuck her.

01:14:41.666 --> 01:14:43.388
- Huh?
- Lucky girl.

01:14:43.468 --> 01:14:46.691
Whoa, whoa. Devin, get over here!

01:14:46.771 --> 01:14:48.459
Come on.

01:14:48.539 --> 01:14:51.129
This is my boy Charlie.
He just got outta rehab.

01:14:51.209 --> 01:14:52.997
- He's a bad boy.
- Oh, really?

01:14:53.077 --> 01:14:55.421
Yeah. Yeah, I'm absolutely terrible.

01:14:56.747 --> 01:15:00.605
- So, what program are you in?
- None of them.

01:15:00.685 --> 01:15:04.041
- So, you're at UCLA?
- No.

01:15:04.121 --> 01:15:05.998
So, where do you go to school?

01:15:07.258 --> 01:15:10.034
- Do you really care?
- No.

01:15:20.338 --> 01:15:22.827
He's been with Adam the whole time?

01:15:22.907 --> 01:15:26.264
No, he's been to a couple
different homeless shelters,

01:15:26.344 --> 01:15:28.457
then the streets.

01:15:31.415 --> 01:15:34.238
Should we bring him in?

01:15:34.318 --> 01:15:36.240
No.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.109
Just keep an eye on him.

01:15:40.992 --> 01:15:43.014
- Suck it down, bitch.
- Drink it.

01:15:43.094 --> 01:15:45.016
Did you drink the whole thing?

01:15:47.064 --> 01:15:48.407
Fuck!

01:15:49.133 --> 01:15:52.457
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:15:52.537 --> 01:15:54.225
Yeah! Oh, my...

01:15:54.305 --> 01:15:58.729
Oh, I wanna feel a little of that.
That's it, that's it right there.

01:15:59.509 --> 01:16:01.765
You were on fire tonight, baby.

01:16:02.345 --> 01:16:03.968
Oh, man.

01:16:04.048 --> 01:16:06.637
Yo, this could've been us
the whole fucking time.

01:16:06.717 --> 01:16:08.539
- I know.
- Yeah.

01:16:08.619 --> 01:16:10.908
Hey, come here.

01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:12.763
- Bring it in.
- Oh...

01:16:13.624 --> 01:16:15.947
- I fucking love you, man.
- Love you, too, man.

01:16:16.027 --> 01:16:17.415
I love you, though. I love you.

01:16:17.495 --> 01:16:19.817
- I love you, man.
- You being honest?

01:16:19.897 --> 01:16:21.886
- Yeah, mostly.
- You feel the real...

01:16:21.966 --> 01:16:24.754
I love most things about you.
We don't have to get into it.

01:16:27.371 --> 01:16:30.361
- Oh!
- That was tight.

01:16:30.441 --> 01:16:31.996
I'm gonna make you a Star of David.

01:16:32.076 --> 01:16:34.165
- Really?
- Yeah, it's my heritage.

01:16:34.245 --> 01:16:36.691
Just let me do it.

01:16:40.151 --> 01:16:42.495
Fuck it.

01:16:44.487 --> 01:16:45.910
Hey, what was the name of that,

01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:48.779
- uh, that ugly chick?
- Mm.

01:16:48.859 --> 01:16:51.482
- Stacey Chapman?
- Oh, no, no.

01:16:51.562 --> 01:16:53.584
Uh, the other one. Um, fuck, what's her name?

01:16:53.664 --> 01:16:56.120
You know, she had the big nose
and the really close-set eyes.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.089
She looked kinda like, um, Paul Giamatti.

01:16:58.169 --> 01:17:00.124
- Jenny Henson.
- Yes, Paul... Yes.

01:17:00.204 --> 01:17:02.193
Yes, fucking Paul Giamatti.

01:17:02.273 --> 01:17:04.128
- Jenny Paul Giamatti Henson.
- Giamatti Henson.

01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:06.964
Oh, my God. You know,
she was the one that ratted us out

01:17:07.044 --> 01:17:08.666
when we released those mice
from the science room.

01:17:08.746 --> 01:17:09.867
You still holding on to that shit?

01:17:09.947 --> 01:17:11.102
Fuck, yeah, I'm still holding on to that.

01:17:11.182 --> 01:17:13.237
- You gotta let go of that, man.
- Yeah, easy for you to say.

01:17:13.317 --> 01:17:17.041
You never fucking got caught.
I never dodged a single fucking bullet.

01:17:17.121 --> 01:17:20.111
Yeah, well, sometimes you dodge one,
you just... you move in front of another.

01:17:20.191 --> 01:17:23.447
- You never fucking know.
- Yeah, like you ever got hit.

01:17:23.527 --> 01:17:26.417
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:17:26.497 --> 01:17:28.519
You kidding me, dude? You're fucking Teflon.

01:17:28.599 --> 01:17:31.255
You do whatever you want,
you never get a fucking scratch on you.

01:17:31.335 --> 01:17:33.324
Yeah, yeah, that's me.
I'm un-fucking-scathed.

01:17:33.404 --> 01:17:34.825
- Yeah.
- That's what you think?

01:17:34.905 --> 01:17:36.093
- That's what I know.
- Really?

01:17:36.173 --> 01:17:37.562
Are you kidding me? That night at Jackson's?

01:17:37.642 --> 01:17:39.564
Perfect, the night at Jackson's.
Let's talk about the night at Jackson's.

01:17:39.644 --> 01:17:41.966
Let's talk about it. All right, so...

01:17:42.046 --> 01:17:46.203
we all took the same shit... Jackson OD'd,
I got shipped off to the wilderness,

01:17:46.283 --> 01:17:48.973
and you, you went
back to school the next day.

01:17:49.053 --> 01:17:51.742
- Am I missing something?
- Well...

01:17:51.822 --> 01:17:54.878
it just as easily gone to shit for me, too.

01:17:55.708 --> 01:17:57.415
But it didn't, that's the point.

01:17:57.495 --> 01:18:00.384
Two very large men did not
come into your room at 4:00 a.m.,

01:18:00.464 --> 01:18:02.520
kidnap you, drag you off to desert.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.689
- You got a total fucking pass.
- Pass?

01:18:04.769 --> 01:18:06.390
After the police showed up
and took Jackson to the hospital,

01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:07.658
my parents came to pick me up.

01:18:07.738 --> 01:18:09.327
The entire ride home,
they didn't say anything to me.

01:18:09.407 --> 01:18:11.195
Nothing. Not... not one word.

01:18:11.275 --> 01:18:13.130
Okay, I was sitting there in the
backseat waiting for the hammer to drop,

01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:15.315
but they didn't say anything.

01:18:16.547 --> 01:18:18.235
The fucking silence was unbearable.

01:18:18.315 --> 01:18:20.004
Ten minutes from the house, I just...

01:18:20.084 --> 01:18:22.223
I confessed to everything.

01:18:24.588 --> 01:18:28.346
- What'd they say?
- That's the point.

01:18:28.426 --> 01:18:30.303
Absolutely nothing.

01:18:32.196 --> 01:18:34.418
They didn't open their mouths
until we got home,

01:18:34.498 --> 01:18:37.355
and then all they said then was,
"Go to your room and do your homework.

01:18:37.435 --> 01:18:40.491
You got your interview
at Harvard-Westlake in a week."

01:18:41.371 --> 01:18:42.860
Fuck.

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:47.465
Jackson almost died, and I was all fucked up.

01:18:47.545 --> 01:18:50.468
And all they cared about
was my fucking homework.

01:18:50.548 --> 01:18:52.937
I mean, I... I could have track marks
up and down my arms,

01:18:53.017 --> 01:18:56.897
and as long as I had good grades,
you know, that's all that mattered.

01:19:01.092 --> 01:19:03.547
It's like all they cared about was that...

01:19:03.627 --> 01:19:05.664
fucking bumper sticker.

01:19:06.931 --> 01:19:09.537
"My son is an honor student."

01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:16.394
Hey, enough of that emotional shit, right?

01:19:16.474 --> 01:19:18.562
- We're all good now.
- Yeah.

01:19:20.442 --> 01:19:21.850
Yeah.

01:19:22.113 --> 01:19:24.269
Oh, fuck.

01:19:25.349 --> 01:19:27.338
I'm thinking about taking some classes here.

01:19:27.418 --> 01:19:28.773
- Dude... do it.
- Yeah.

01:19:28.853 --> 01:19:30.074
- Yeah.
- Join me, baby.

01:19:30.154 --> 01:19:31.509
Fuck, you think I can do the college thing?

01:19:31.589 --> 01:19:34.011
Oh, yeah, you're doing it right now.
This is it.

01:19:34.091 --> 01:19:36.080
- Well, I gotta get my G.E.D.
- It's easy.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.449
Just get that and then golden.

01:19:38.529 --> 01:19:40.451
- Should I get a tutor?
- No, dude, just get a book.

01:19:40.531 --> 01:19:42.953
You'll be fine.

01:19:44.033 --> 01:19:45.089
Want some of this?

01:19:45.169 --> 01:19:46.590
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:48.426
- What?
- Your no...

01:19:48.506 --> 01:19:50.394
- Oh.
- Ah, fuck.

01:19:50.474 --> 01:19:52.420
Lightweight.

01:20:07.258 --> 01:20:09.447
The bleeding stopped, so...

01:20:11.295 --> 01:20:14.351
Adam, what the fuck are you doing?

01:20:14.431 --> 01:20:15.853
Oh, fuck, Adam!

01:20:15.933 --> 01:20:18.222
No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, my God. Fuck.

01:20:18.302 --> 01:20:20.458
Adam! Adam! Hey, buddy, come on!

01:20:20.538 --> 01:20:23.060
Fuck! Um... fuck.

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.029
Oh, fuck.

01:20:25.109 --> 01:20:27.364
Hey, I'm getting help. Oh, fuck.

01:20:27.444 --> 01:20:29.100
Can you hear me, bud? Stay with me, man.

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:32.470
- Stay with me, man! Come on!
- 9-1-1, what is your emergency?

01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:34.805
Hey, uh, hey, I need an ambulance.

01:20:34.885 --> 01:20:36.774
Um, uh, my friend did too much shit.

01:20:36.854 --> 01:20:38.809
- Um, fuck! I don't know what to do!
- What is your location?

01:20:38.889 --> 01:20:40.678
Can you just help me out, please?
It's 158 Olive Street.

01:20:40.758 --> 01:20:41.712
Just hurry, please! Please!

01:20:41.792 --> 01:20:44.048
- Fuck.
- Sir, if you could just remain calm.

01:20:44.128 --> 01:20:46.916
- Come on! Fuck!
- Sir...

01:20:50.668 --> 01:20:53.114
Stay... Come on, man.

01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:28.692
Yeah, go ahead. We're clear.

01:21:31.442 --> 01:21:34.598
So, what can you tell me?

01:21:34.678 --> 01:21:36.467
Did you see anything?

01:21:36.547 --> 01:21:39.470
Remember anything? Take your time.

01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:43.274
Look, man, we just don't want
anymore dead kids turning up.

01:21:43.354 --> 01:21:45.776
- Did you put this kid in the system?
- I did, sir.

01:21:45.856 --> 01:21:49.446
Pull him, put him in an empty cell,
and give him a bed.

01:21:54.965 --> 01:21:56.467
Hey, Charlie.

01:21:58.402 --> 01:22:00.313
Come on, let's go.

01:22:01.705 --> 01:22:03.981
Your mom's outside.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.692
We want you to come home.

01:22:15.819 --> 01:22:18.709
With only three days before
Californians cast their ballets,

01:22:18.789 --> 01:22:20.511
and the race being as tight as it is,

01:22:20.591 --> 01:22:24.148
this could be the 11th hour event
that swings this thing away from Mills.

01:22:24.228 --> 01:22:27.418
Unless the voters have already
baked in his issues with his son.

01:22:27.498 --> 01:22:29.787
It's one thing to have a child
with drug problems.

01:22:29.867 --> 01:22:31.722
It's another to be involved in a death.

01:22:31.802 --> 01:22:35.226
Mills' son was completely cleared
of any involvement in his friend's death.

01:22:35.306 --> 01:22:38.796
I'm just saying, in some voters' minds,
there will always be lingering doubts.

01:23:40.337 --> 01:23:42.159
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23:42.239 --> 01:23:45.186
- You look better.
- Thanks.

01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:58.057
Why did he have to die?

01:24:04.061 --> 01:24:06.007
I don't know.

01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:15.709
I don't wanna die.

01:24:22.846 --> 01:24:25.258
That's good.

01:24:29.453 --> 01:24:32.209
Hey, Mom, I don't, um...

01:24:32.289 --> 01:24:34.963
I don't think I can stay here tonight.

01:24:38.028 --> 01:24:39.883
I know.

01:24:39.963 --> 01:24:41.352
That's okay.

01:24:41.432 --> 01:24:47.091
# Many's the time I've been mistaken #

01:24:47.171 --> 01:24:51.381
# And many times confused #

01:24:52.643 --> 01:24:58.202
# Yes, and I've often felt forsaken #

01:24:58.282 --> 01:25:04.008
# And certainly misused #

01:25:04.088 --> 01:25:07.044
# Oh, but I'm all right #

01:25:07.124 --> 01:25:09.346
# I'm all right #

01:25:09.426 --> 01:25:14.432
# I'm just weary to my bones #

01:25:16.834 --> 01:25:22.159
# Still, you don't expect to be
bright and bon vivant #

01:25:22.239 --> 01:25:27.431
# So far away from home... #

01:25:27.511 --> 01:25:29.700
Mr. Mills, Mrs. Mills,
who did you two vote for?

01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:31.201
Well, I can't speak for my wife,

01:25:31.281 --> 01:25:33.170
but I'm sure you can figure out
who I voted for.

01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:34.538
Thank you.

01:25:34.618 --> 01:25:40.310
# I don't know a soul
who's not been battered #

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:45.115
# I don't have a friend who feels at ease #

01:25:45.195 --> 01:25:51.388
# I don't know a dream
that's not been shattered #

01:25:51.468 --> 01:25:56.894
# Or driven to its knees #

01:25:56.974 --> 01:26:01.832
# Oh, but it's all right, it's all right... #

01:26:01.912 --> 01:26:03.634
With all the other counties reporting in,

01:26:03.714 --> 01:26:07.671
and with Santa Cruz going to Harper,
Mills looks to be in trouble.

01:26:07.751 --> 01:26:11.275
It's gonna come down to little
Del Norte, population 28,000,

01:26:11.355 --> 01:26:14.144
and all Harper needs is 45% of the vote

01:26:14.224 --> 01:26:16.713
in what has traditionally been
a republican stronghold.

01:26:16.793 --> 01:26:19.083
Hey, Jenny, how are ya? Thanks for coming.

01:26:19.163 --> 01:26:22.186
No returns from Santa Cruz
or Del Norte have come in.

01:26:22.266 --> 01:26:25.689
Well, what the hell are they doing up there,
counting votes on their fucking fingers?

01:26:25.769 --> 01:26:27.749
Excuse me, sir.

01:26:28.939 --> 01:26:31.562
- Are you all right?
- Does it matter?

01:26:31.642 --> 01:26:34.164
Is, uh, is Charlie coming back?

01:26:34.244 --> 01:26:36.333
I don't know.

01:26:36.413 --> 01:26:38.484
Why don't we go inside, huh?

01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:45.509
# Still, tomorrow's gonna be
another working day #

01:26:45.589 --> 01:26:51.048
# And I'm trying to get some rest #

01:26:51.128 --> 01:26:56.976
# That's all, I'm trying to get some rest #

01:27:06.810 --> 01:27:09.666
- Come on, let's go sit down, okay?
- Did we win?

01:27:09.746 --> 01:27:12.783
It doesn't look that way.

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:16.373
I'd really like for you to be there
at my concession speech, though.

01:27:16.453 --> 01:27:19.610
There's a first,
you having to make a concession.

01:27:21.758 --> 01:27:24.014
Here, come on.

01:27:24.094 --> 01:27:25.968
Can you just...

01:27:29.266 --> 01:27:31.071
Okay.

01:27:39.309 --> 01:27:42.051
I miss our boy.

01:27:44.047 --> 01:27:47.004
All right, look, um...

01:27:47.084 --> 01:27:49.339
I'm gonna get you some coffee, okay?

01:27:49.419 --> 01:27:50.807
All right?

01:27:50.887 --> 01:27:53.231
- Just wait right here.
- Okay.

01:27:54.891 --> 01:27:58.015
Sir! We did it.

01:27:58.095 --> 01:28:02.085
- Did what?
- We took Del Norte by seven points.

01:28:02.165 --> 01:28:05.956
- Can't be.
- 7.2 to be exact.

01:28:07.136 --> 01:28:09.425
You're wanted out there, Governor.

01:28:11.908 --> 01:28:15.199
In a shocking upset,
Mills has beat out his opponent

01:28:15.279 --> 01:28:17.201
Thomas Harper in Del Norte County.

01:28:17.281 --> 01:28:20.237
Fox 11 News is now prepared
to call this election

01:28:20.317 --> 01:28:23.874
for the new governor of
the state of California, David Mills.

01:28:23.954 --> 01:28:26.276
Let's get the whole family up here.
Liseanne, Charlie.

01:28:26.356 --> 01:28:27.844
Come up on stage.

01:28:27.924 --> 01:28:29.446
Did not expect this to happen.

01:28:29.526 --> 01:28:34.191
And right now, they are chanting
for their new governor, David Mills...

01:28:34.272 --> 01:28:38.689
Please welcome the new governor
of California, Mr. David Mills!

01:28:41.405 --> 01:28:43.627
Here he comes. Let's focus in on him.

01:28:43.707 --> 01:28:45.584
Thank you so much.

01:29:09.633 --> 01:29:11.306
Thank you.

01:29:12.636 --> 01:29:13.724
Thank you.

01:30:01.985 --> 01:30:03.896
Hey.

01:30:12.095 --> 01:30:15.719
- You're up early.
- Haven't gone to sleep yet.

01:30:19.002 --> 01:30:21.039
What are you doing?

01:30:22.305 --> 01:30:24.027
Just cleaning up.

01:30:24.107 --> 01:30:26.747
- You need some help?
- I'm fine.

01:30:31.948 --> 01:30:35.657
- Mind if I sit?
- It's your house.

01:30:52.636 --> 01:30:54.725
Look, uh, ahem.

01:30:54.805 --> 01:30:56.694
Charlie...

01:30:57.574 --> 01:31:02.032
I know you're angry to me, and you
probably don't wanna hear this right now,

01:31:02.112 --> 01:31:04.649
but I do love you.

01:31:12.422 --> 01:31:14.561
I'm sorry.

01:31:15.592 --> 01:31:18.148
Every expert with a desk and diploma

01:31:18.228 --> 01:31:20.834
told me I had to be tough on you.

01:31:22.699 --> 01:31:25.622
But every time we sent you away
to another one of those programs,

01:31:25.702 --> 01:31:28.911
I... I saw you slipping further away from us.

01:31:30.907 --> 01:31:33.012
And all I could tell myself was...

01:31:34.945 --> 01:31:37.824
I'd rather have you alive and hating me...

01:31:39.049 --> 01:31:41.222
then dead on the streets.

01:31:46.490 --> 01:31:48.812
So, what do you want me to do?

01:31:48.892 --> 01:31:50.769
Tell me what to do.

01:31:51.761 --> 01:31:53.968
You don't have to do anything.

01:31:56.166 --> 01:31:58.622
You, um...

01:31:58.702 --> 01:32:00.590
you wanna come up to Sacramento?

01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:03.393
- Get away from all the...
- What?

01:32:03.473 --> 01:32:05.510
The drugs?

01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:09.650
It was never about the drugs.

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:12.821
All I ever wanted was...

01:32:15.151 --> 01:32:17.641
a way to kill the noise.

01:32:17.721 --> 01:32:19.962
But the more I used...

01:32:20.957 --> 01:32:22.766
the louder it got.

01:32:24.427 --> 01:32:27.636
I was part of the noise, wasn't I?

01:32:33.937 --> 01:32:35.644
So, uh...

01:32:36.873 --> 01:32:39.251
what are you gonna do?

01:32:40.410 --> 01:32:41.980
I don't know.

01:32:43.179 --> 01:32:45.159
I'll figure it out.

01:32:57.561 --> 01:32:59.768
I don't hate you.

01:33:03.633 --> 01:33:05.704
I don't.

01:33:22.919 --> 01:33:26.093
You take good care of yourself, okay?

01:33:27.223 --> 01:33:28.896
Okay?

01:33:33.930 --> 01:33:37.654
Hey, so...

01:33:37.734 --> 01:33:39.509
did you win?

01:33:40.937 --> 01:33:42.575
Yeah.

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:46.497
All right.

01:33:55.118 --> 01:33:57.974
If they say you only have a year to live,

01:33:58.054 --> 01:34:00.577
do it sober.

01:34:00.657 --> 01:34:03.112
It'll seem like an eternity.

01:34:05.095 --> 01:34:06.816
It's been kind of a weird year for me.

01:34:06.896 --> 01:34:09.672
You know, I managed to get fired
from an unpaid internship.

01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:13.323
Do you know how bad you have to be

01:34:13.403 --> 01:34:17.093
to get fired from a job
that you're not getting paid for?

01:34:17.173 --> 01:34:19.429
It's like if the Pharaoh
came up to you and he said,

01:34:19.509 --> 01:34:22.332
"I'm not letting all your people go,

01:34:22.412 --> 01:34:24.467
just you."

01:34:24.547 --> 01:34:27.704
Yeah, but, uh, things have not been
much better with the girls either.

01:34:27.784 --> 01:34:29.339
It hasn't.

01:34:29.419 --> 01:34:31.408
You know, from my limited experience,

01:34:31.488 --> 01:34:34.711
I found that girls, for some reason,
have a problem with stand-up comics.

01:34:34.791 --> 01:34:38.648
I don't know why. I mean, they say
that they want a guy to make them laugh,

01:34:38.728 --> 01:34:43.086
a guy that has a sense of humor, but making
them laugh just never quite closes the deal.

01:34:43.166 --> 01:34:45.755
You could be the greatest
stand-up of all time

01:34:45.835 --> 01:34:49.091
and you won't get half as much pussy
as your average bass player.

01:34:49.971 --> 01:34:54.165
I'm kind of embarrassed to say
that I've been checking out Tinder.

01:34:55.445 --> 01:34:58.818
Ah, I got a few, uh,
regulars in the audience here.

01:35:00.316 --> 01:35:01.605
You know what, I take that back.

01:35:01.685 --> 01:35:05.041
Tinder is the greatest invention
of the 21st century. Seriously.

01:35:05.121 --> 01:35:08.345
I mean, fuck Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,

01:35:08.425 --> 01:35:13.483
all that bullshit with the likes and
the comments and the fucking followers.

01:35:13.563 --> 01:35:18.088
Tinder is the only app where people
who like you will actually fuck you.

01:35:19.469 --> 01:35:23.815
# So whether music or madness #

01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:29.232
# Live by one of the two #

01:35:29.312 --> 01:35:32.435
# By one of the two #

01:35:32.515 --> 01:35:39.476
# So go on, fill your heart up
with gladness #

01:35:39.556 --> 01:35:42.400
# Not a moment too soon #

01:35:43.126 --> 01:35:46.383
# Not a moment too soon #

01:35:46.463 --> 01:35:52.555
# Should we ration the reasons #

01:35:52.635 --> 01:35:56.159
# To the charts that ignore? #

01:35:56.239 --> 01:35:59.963
# Of this I've never been sure #

01:36:00.043 --> 01:36:06.102
# So I will follow the feeling #

01:36:06.182 --> 01:36:09.773
# And sing fever to the the form #

01:36:09.853 --> 01:36:13.243
# Oh, my fever to the form #

01:36:13.323 --> 01:36:17.580
# Maybe that's why I'm #

01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:20.617
# At your window #

01:36:20.697 --> 01:36:23.353
# Hear me at your door #

01:36:23.433 --> 01:36:28.075
# Singing give me some more #

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:36.599
# Oh, fever to the form #

01:36:36.679 --> 01:36:40.537
# Won't you hear me at your door #

01:36:40.617 --> 01:36:44.007
# Singing give me some more? #

01:36:44.087 --> 01:36:50.113
# 'Cause you were never empty #

01:36:50.193 --> 01:36:53.349
# And we've been here before #

01:36:53.429 --> 01:36:57.620
# Yes, we've been here before #

01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:04.060
# But now there's always plenty #

01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:07.630
# Yet still we ask for more #

01:37:07.710 --> 01:37:14.423
# Singing fever to the form #

01:37:15.305 --> 01:37:21.793
