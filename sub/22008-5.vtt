WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.793
We never pass by a lemonade stand
without stopping.

00:04.963 --> 00:07.455
- Isn't that right, Christian?
- Never.

00:07.633 --> 00:09.920
- Thank you.
- Would you like a straw?

00:10.093 --> 00:11.880
Yes, please.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.338
Yes. Two pitchers already.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.759
It's the cutest thing.
But a terrible business model.

00:18.936 --> 00:22.020
I must have spent 30 pounds
on lemons and cups.

00:26.318 --> 00:29.561
Yeah. Honey, hold on a sec.
Ethan, what are you doing?

00:29.738 --> 00:31.229
It's snowing!

00:31.406 --> 00:34.149
- What? Honey, it's...
- Mommy, it's snowing.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.298
My eye. Mom, my eye. It burns.

00:56.139 --> 00:59.007
Ash? This is ash.

01:07.484 --> 01:10.477
Everyone, inside right now.
Get inside now.

01:10.654 --> 01:13.362
Get inside the house. Go, go!

01:36.471 --> 01:40.715
<i>This is Baker 24, we're moving
to that location, ETA 15.</i>

01:47.649 --> 01:49.515
Tell me everything.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.273
<i>Liz, what happened?</i>

01:54.823 --> 01:56.780
Nik's dead.

01:57.492 --> 01:58.858
What?

01:59.745 --> 02:01.862
He was strangled.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.581
They found his body in an empty lot...

02:07.085 --> 02:10.294
...miles away from home or any hospital.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.875
What? How? Do they know?

02:12.049 --> 02:16.419
The last thing he said to me was
that he never wanted to see me again.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.470
Liz.

02:19.640 --> 02:23.224
- Do they know what happened?
- No, but we do.

02:23.393 --> 02:27.103
- Reddington.
- After the surgery, Nik said he was out.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.356
Reddington probably thought
he was a liability, he knew too much.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.484
- You don't know that.
- Nik was good. He was decent.

02:33.654 --> 02:37.022
The only indecent thing in his life
was Reddington and me.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.906
You didn't do this.

02:39.076 --> 02:43.241
Would Nik be alive if I weren't in his life?

02:54.716 --> 02:56.582
You're not my type, okay?

02:56.760 --> 02:59.844
But if you were even remotely
in the ballpark...

03:00.013 --> 03:01.629
...I would have your child.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.091
- Have a count?
- The mailman gave us two lists.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.978
Each had 22 people who wanted
their mail held while on vacation.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.230
That's 44 empty apartments.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.269
We rented 18 for five nights each
at 500 a night.

03:15.445 --> 03:19.655
That's $45,000, for the week, off two lists.

03:19.825 --> 03:23.785
- Next week, we should have eight.
- Hear that? I just dropped an egg.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.162
While I appreciate your enthusiasm...

03:26.331 --> 03:29.574
...we have cash
but no business to run it through.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.083
Elizabeth.

03:31.253 --> 03:34.212
- Could you excuse us?
- Way ahead of you, sister.

03:34.381 --> 03:38.250
No offense, but when I get
too close to a fed, I tend to chafe.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.180
Nik Korpal was murdered.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.177
I'm sorry to hear that.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.562
I wanna believe you.

03:52.858 --> 03:56.693
It's possible Nik was killed
by someone with a connection to me.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.946
I have no idea who or what
that connection might be.

04:00.115 --> 04:03.984
- I want a name.
- I'll do what I can to find you one.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.912
In the meantime,
a riddle to keep you occupied.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.784
The chemical plant explosion in Leeds?

04:12.961 --> 04:15.704
Ilyas Surkov claimed credit for that.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.332
- What's the riddle?
- Why take credit...

04:19.509 --> 04:21.671
...for a crime he didn't commit?

04:21.845 --> 04:25.464
- How do you know he didn't commit it?
- Because Surkov is dead.

04:25.640 --> 04:29.259
- Dead? How long?
- According to Reddington, 15 months.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.520
No one knows this?
Was there any HUMINT on Surkov?

04:32.689 --> 04:33.930
No, he was like a ghost.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.565
One month, he claimed credit
for a bombing in Lisbon.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.728
The next,
kidnapping three journalists in Crimea.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.363
- If he died, no one would know.
- Reddington would?

04:42.532 --> 04:45.616
He knows the best off-market doctors
on every continent.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.904
One of them treated Surkov
for end-stage pancreatic cancer.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.414
Hang on. Okay, Mr. Reddington says
it's been 15 months.

04:52.584 --> 04:55.827
In that time,
Surkov has taken credit for three attacks.

04:56.004 --> 04:59.168
A downed plane on a humanitarian
mission to Boko Haram victims...

04:59.341 --> 05:02.334
...a Paris cafe demolished
by a C-4 suitcase bomb...

05:02.511 --> 05:04.924
...and yesterday's chemical-plant attack.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.884
- Pretty busy for a dead guy.
- Or people acting in his name.

05:08.058 --> 05:11.222
We won't know which until we find
the bomber. I'll reach out to MI6.

05:11.394 --> 05:15.513
Ressler, Keen, get to the bomb site.
Talk to local authorities.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.021
Liam Gladstone, MI6.
We spoke on the phone.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.402
Agent Ressler, Keen.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.359
May not look like it,
but we were incredibly lucky.

05:24.533 --> 05:28.493
Minor leaks, but none of the tanks
of the nasty stuff went up. EA cleared us.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.949
You ask your task force
about our copycat theory?

05:31.122 --> 05:33.705
Doesn't hold water.
This is the work of Surkov.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.288
- What makes you confident?
- Know what taggants are?

05:36.461 --> 05:39.499
Chemical markers embedded
into explosives to trace their origin.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.882
MI6 has been working closely
with the CIA's Surkov task force.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.260
We identified a construction
and demolition company in Belgrade.

05:46.429 --> 05:50.389
We believe it's diverting
legitimately purchased C-4 to Surkov.

05:50.559 --> 05:54.678
To test our theory, we planted
a taggant in C-4 we sold to the company.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.563
- You found traces of that taggant.
- Who's your suspect?

05:57.732 --> 06:01.976
Raqaan Ghaffari, a foreman
at Lignes D'Avenir Construction.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.442
Any doubts, they'll be put to rest
when Surkov hits again.

06:05.615 --> 06:09.234
Which he will. I can assure you,
the man is very much alive.

06:10.036 --> 06:14.371
C-4 is not strong enough to pierce solid
steel lined with Kevlar as you requested...

06:14.791 --> 06:17.625
...but I have found a substitute
that should work well.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.717
Yes. Perfect.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.763
Yeah.

06:35.937 --> 06:39.180
He says this will do.
And he wants to move quickly.

06:48.992 --> 06:52.156
Raqaan Ghaffari, he's in charge
of demolition for Lignes D'Avenir...

06:52.329 --> 06:54.116
...a midsized contractor in Belgrade.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.532
We know the explosives used by Surkov
in his last three attacks...

06:57.709 --> 07:00.793
- ...came from Lignes D'Avenir.
- We have no authority in Belgrade.

07:00.962 --> 07:04.626
I'll reach out to Serbian officials.
If you want this guy to lead us to...

07:04.799 --> 07:07.542
...who's acting in Surkov's name,
we need to get creative.

07:07.719 --> 07:11.429
MI6 has Ghaffari under surveillance.
But no actionable intel.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.011
Ghaffari proves
to be quite the creature of habit.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.642
Ghaffari eats lunch every Friday
at the Brutka Club.

07:16.811 --> 07:21.181
- That's where we make contact.
- Ghaffari speaks French and Arabic.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.520
<i>Surveillance logs gave us
what we believe is...</i>

07:23.693 --> 07:25.776
<i>...Ghaffari's code name for Surkov.</i>

07:25.946 --> 07:28.359
Samar can use that
to establish her credibility.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.818
You'll have us on comms,
but to pick up Ghaffari, this mic...

07:33.995 --> 07:36.533
...it's gonna need to be close, all right?

07:36.706 --> 07:37.913
There.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.532
I'll let you. Yeah.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.668
- It's going to be fine.
- I know.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.625
If you did,
you wouldn't have come all this way.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.332
Please, just...

07:50.428 --> 07:52.294
...be careful.

07:57.102 --> 08:00.266
Heads up. She's about to make contact.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.855
Mr. Ghaffari.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.642
Who are you?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.776
I'm here about the Masbahi account.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.529
We have a protocol.
You shouldn't be making contact like this.

08:13.702 --> 08:17.696
- Aram, you getting this?
- Loud and clear. This is definitely our guy.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.659
The protocol's blown. You think
our friend wants to reach out like this?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.995
Expose himself? There's a problem.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.535
We have reason to believe
your product has been compromised.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.079
Impossible.

08:26.256 --> 08:30.671
Our government sources are saying
your product was tagged by MI6.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.972
- I will check.
- That's why I'm here.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.681
He wants me to test the next shipment
before we accept delivery.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.018
The man at that table,
the other two at the door, they're with me.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.477
Will it be a problem, Raqaan?

08:49.571 --> 08:50.607
Good.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.990
I'll notify my people.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.462
<i>I think Nik was killed
by a guy named Pete McGee.</i>

09:08.631 --> 09:10.839
<i>Nik asked him
to ID a skeleton I'd given him.</i>

09:11.009 --> 09:14.173
He got a DNA sample and ran it
against the federal database.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.758
<i>I know the ID is extremely valuable...</i>

09:16.931 --> 09:19.594
<i>...because Reddington wants
to keep it secret.</i>

09:20.602 --> 09:23.561
<i>But I didn't know
that people would kill for it.</i>

09:23.730 --> 09:25.266
<i>Now Nik's dead, McGee's gone.</i>

09:25.440 --> 09:29.434
The only lead I have on him
and that ID is the clinic he worked at.

09:29.611 --> 09:33.446
<i>A place where experimental drugs
are tested on human guinea pigs.</i>

09:33.615 --> 09:38.235
Yeah, I know. Not much of a plan.
If you got a better one, I'm all ears.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.154
Don't look at me like that.
Rose will be here.

09:41.331 --> 09:45.496
We both know she's your favorite.
No, I am not lying to Mommy.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.204
I want her to know the truth.

09:47.378 --> 09:51.122
That's why I need to ID these bones
without anybody knowing.

09:53.718 --> 09:54.834
It's not a lie.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.423
It's just delayed honesty.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.682
Hi, I'm calling about the clinical trials.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.723
Yeah, I wanna sign up.

10:06.773 --> 10:10.266
Have you ever done
an inpatient clinical trial, Mr. Lembeck?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.527
- First time. Be gentle.
- I'll need a copy of your ID.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.564
- Sure.
- Step forward, please.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.119
How much am I getting,
to rent my body to science?

10:22.288 --> 10:24.029
- Two hundred a day.
- Lucky me.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.449
We need medical history
and emergency contact...

10:26.626 --> 10:30.415
- ...for when you have an adverse reaction.
- "When"? Not "if"?

10:41.307 --> 10:42.343
Get in the car.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.765
- Buddy, whatever it is...
- Mr. Reddington wants to talk.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.225
"Reddington" Reddington?

10:53.319 --> 10:55.402
Bring the dog. Leave the poop.

10:57.031 --> 11:01.947
Rosie Cavendish had a bulldog, Franklin.
Named after her great uncle.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.363
Poor guy had eczema,
dermatitis, seborrhea.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.283
One skin condition after the next.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.825
The dog, not the uncle.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.836
Please, sir, if I did something...

11:13.006 --> 11:16.249
Given the lesions on her inner folds,
she has pyoderma.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.840
What are you doing to treat it?
Topical ointments or pills?

11:20.013 --> 11:23.973
- I need to be better with her checkups.
- I need to borrow evidence, Lou.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.974
- You know my name?
- Personal effects...

11:26.144 --> 11:28.978
...of a homicide victim
currently in Evidence Control.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.639
- I don't know... Yes.
- You are the clerk there.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.978
Responsible for checking
in and out evidence.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.860
- That's true, but...
- The deceased's name is Nik Korpal.

11:37.030 --> 11:41.320
You have 24 hours. That should
give us enough time to get... What?

11:41.492 --> 11:44.860
- Coco.
- To get Coco the spa day...

11:45.038 --> 11:46.870
...she so desperately deserves.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.157
Yeah, you're gonna have fun.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.836
They're ready.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.588
We need to go.

12:02.931 --> 12:06.424
Why didn't your people reach out
to the office in Savamala?

12:28.790 --> 12:29.906
Oh, my gosh. No.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.290
Who are these guys?

12:31.459 --> 12:32.575
No, no, no.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.163
Crap, crap, no.

12:34.337 --> 12:37.080
Stop. Wait. FBI.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.505
- Who the hell was that?
- We had him.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.635
- What are you doing?
- I don't know how to drive.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.424
Get out! Move.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.234
Maybe you could slow down a bit.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.410
There's an alley. Alley ahead!

13:12.583 --> 13:14.119
Alley ahead.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.628
- Duck!
- Oh, God.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.378
Watch out.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.426
Oh, God!

13:28.349 --> 13:30.181
Watch out, watch out.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.730
Come on.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.148
They crashed. They crashed.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.029
Oh, God.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.320
Drop the gun! Down! Put it down!

13:47.493 --> 13:49.530
- Back away! We will fire!
- Drop your weapon!

13:49.704 --> 13:51.912
- Not happening!
- All right, all right!

13:52.081 --> 13:53.697
Easy, easy.

13:53.875 --> 13:57.084
Nobody's gonna fire.
You look like you're in charge.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.996
- I'm gonna reach into my pocket.
- Slowly.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.165
Donald Ressler, FBI.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.753
FBI?

14:04.177 --> 14:05.668
Who the hell are you?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.507
Name's Reuther.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.046
We're CIA.

14:19.150 --> 14:22.439
Yevtukh Roofing Company,
safe-house front owned by the agency.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.729
You want confirmation,
call the station chief.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.944
- Why no de-confliction protocol?
- We're Clandestine Service.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.154
- Who are you?
- I can't answer that.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.911
- All I can tell you...
- Black book. Langley verified.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.198
- Apology accepted.
- No, it's not.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.493
I don't care who you are or why
you were operating on foreign soil.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.127
- I was doing my job.
- Would've done the same, Coburn.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.959
It's Calhoun. I'm a NOC.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.794
Navabi, slightly injured.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.503
- Sure you're all right?
- Yes.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.964
This is Duke White, Defense Intelligence.

14:49.138 --> 14:53.223
Omar Kabinov, FSS.
I'm Tobias Reuther, Clandestine Service.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.680
- We need to talk to Ghaffari.
- Not gonna happen.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.812
He's officially in our custody.
We're handling interrogation.

14:58.981 --> 15:02.349
- Don't like that, take it up with D.C.
- Don't care who gets him to talk.

15:02.527 --> 15:06.396
As long as you get him to tell us
what he knows, we're happy to sit this out.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.234
Okay.

15:13.579 --> 15:17.163
Congratulations.
Your stipend was increased to $250.

15:17.333 --> 15:22.249
- Fantastic. What did I do to earn that?
- You got approved for a riskier study.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.833
Very exciting.

15:24.006 --> 15:27.420
What's with the security?
We're volunteers, not prisoners.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.677
A lot of drugs around here.
Drugs attract drug users.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.089
Makes sense. How much riskier is this?

15:33.266 --> 15:37.306
Previously, some patients developed
temporary neurological problems.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.514
Lie down.

15:38.980 --> 15:42.018
They must've modified
the medication since then, no?

15:42.191 --> 15:44.524
I assume so. I just run the tests.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.610
That's reassuring.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.231
Who's the heart for?

15:50.408 --> 15:51.615
My grandfather.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.118
My brothers and I got drunk
after his funeral...

15:55.288 --> 15:57.325
...decided to get tattoos.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.784
He loved cards.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.824
So my three brothers are...

16:01.002 --> 16:03.870
...the spade, diamond and the club.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.378
And you're the heart.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.081
That's cute.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.672
Aside from brain damage,
what side effects should I expect?

16:10.845 --> 16:13.804
I honestly don't know.
That's what the study's for.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.387
Keep forgetting. I'm just the guinea pig.

16:32.283 --> 16:35.697
Look, Raqaan, I don't know
why you don't feel like talking.

16:35.870 --> 16:39.489
The feds have you on tape
admitting you're supplying Surkov.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.038
You know that.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.829
You must also know that you're not here.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.419
This place doesn't exist.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.084
No lawyers.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.719
No diplomats.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.506
Just us.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.613
He'll crack. They always do.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.532
There are other ways
to get people to talk.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.196
You don't know Surkov.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.867
How long have you been
searching for him?

17:25.670 --> 17:27.536
Six years.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.878
Since before I left the agency
in 2015 to start a family.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.384
Reuther reached out a year later.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.092
He lives and breathes Surkov.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.674
Convinced me
to get back into the hunt.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.885
And the family?

17:48.276 --> 17:50.643
That didn't turn out like I thought.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.937
But it's okay.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.235
I've got Surkov.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.321
He's my family.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.611
My white whale.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.457
Anything?

18:05.626 --> 18:07.618
Give him 20 minutes to simmer.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.412
Okay, you've tried your way.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.422
We're gonna try ours. Samar.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.335
Hey, hold up. What are you doing?

18:20.016 --> 18:21.928
Can I ask you a question?

18:22.351 --> 18:25.014
If their task force is so intent
on finding Surkov...

18:25.187 --> 18:27.725
...why haven't we heard
from them before today?

18:31.485 --> 18:33.772
What the hell is she doing?

18:37.742 --> 18:40.200
Okay, he's ready to talk.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.864
Look closely. What do you see?

18:45.041 --> 18:48.910
A lot of dander, saliva and urine,
all of which I'm allergic to.

18:49.086 --> 18:53.797
If there's a point, you might make it
before I start to wheeze like a chinchilla.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.800
Our liquidity crisis has been solved.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.837
- By doggy day care?
- These are rescue dogs.

19:00.014 --> 19:04.258
Picked up at shelters, given a bath
and a professional grooming.

19:04.435 --> 19:08.850
Then given back to the shelters primped
and proud, and ready for adoption.

19:09.023 --> 19:12.141
They supplement their business
with regular grooming.

19:12.318 --> 19:16.232
But it's basically a labor of love
and a 501(c)(3).

19:16.405 --> 19:19.398
A nonprofit. That is good.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.192
The most ruthless IRS agent
would hesitate...

19:22.370 --> 19:25.863
...before auditing the books
of such a noble enterprise.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.283
That's good if we can run
enough money through it.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.952
Rents are throwing up
nearly 200K a week.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.462
Well, most of their business is mobile.

19:34.632 --> 19:39.343
They have a fleet of vans that go
from shelter to shelter in 10 cities.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.048
That's a hundred vans.

19:41.222 --> 19:44.511
A dozen or more dogs a van, $25 a dog.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.175
- Do the math.
- I just did.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.971
My hand to God, if I found you
a little bit more attractive...

19:50.147 --> 19:52.184
...I would birth you a litter.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.351
Seven pups, boom,
right here on the floor.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.773
Fiona, you're an artist.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.563
Coco's an angel.

19:59.990 --> 20:04.701
Just needed a little TLC.
I have some ointments for you.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.241
And how much do I owe you?

20:07.415 --> 20:08.747
One-fifty.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.158
Which, of course, is tax deductible.

20:11.335 --> 20:15.124
Yes, of course.
And how much for the store?

20:15.297 --> 20:18.290
- The store?
- And the vans, all of them.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.005
Bless you. Bless you.

20:21.637 --> 20:25.881
- They're not for sale.
- At the right price, everything is for sale.

20:26.058 --> 20:30.268
Think about your price
while I let Coco find a blade of grass.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.805
Come on, sweetheart. That's it.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.939
There we go.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.428
<i>Harold.</i>

21:51.602 --> 21:53.343
Thank you for seeing me.

21:53.521 --> 21:56.480
When I heard
there was an FBI task force...

21:56.649 --> 22:00.893
...running an unsanctioned op overseas,
my interest was piqued.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.359
We received a credible tip
that Surkov is dead.

22:04.532 --> 22:08.321
The attacks attributed to him
may be the work of a copycat.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.113
He only met Surkov in video calls.

22:13.290 --> 22:17.125
And your team, do they have a lead
on his bomb maker, Ghaffari?

22:20.172 --> 22:23.586
He asked him to smuggle a device
into a locker in Virginia.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.546
Ghaffari's in Belgrade?

22:25.719 --> 22:29.087
Yes, being questioned
in a CIA facility outside Pancevo.

22:29.265 --> 22:32.224
Does he know the specific target?

22:41.944 --> 22:44.231
Surkov asked him to create a weapon...

22:44.405 --> 22:47.318
...that could penetrate
3.5 centimeters of Kevlar.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.528
I'm with the CIA director of operations.

22:49.702 --> 22:54.163
The Surkov team is in London. There's
no team or safe house in Pancevo.

22:54.331 --> 22:57.074
- They claim otherwise.
<i>- Well, I don't care.</i>

22:57.251 --> 22:59.243
They are not CIA.

23:08.596 --> 23:09.837
- Go.
- Cover me!

23:10.890 --> 23:12.301
Move, move, move.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.511
Give it up.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.635
Hand it over.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.099
You said you were CIA.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.269
Who the hell are you?

23:29.408 --> 23:31.240
You hungry? You tired?

23:31.410 --> 23:34.869
There's a steak and a bed for you
when you tell us where your boss is.

23:35.039 --> 23:37.998
- I don't know.
- Like you didn't know his real name.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.830
- His name is Tobias...
- Reuther.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.211
The agency has no record of him.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.666
No, they disavow him.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.254
Him. Not you, or Duke White,
or Omar Kabinov.

23:48.427 --> 23:52.296
They gave us your file. We confirmed
you resigned from the agency.

23:52.473 --> 23:55.136
- Then Reuther recruited me.
- There's nothing about that.

23:55.309 --> 23:58.643
Or the ghost squad whose designation
is so conveniently top secret...

23:58.812 --> 24:01.179
...you never had contact
with anyone at the agency.

24:01.357 --> 24:04.225
We got orders from Reuther.
Reuther got his from the director.

24:04.401 --> 24:07.235
No one at the director's office
has heard of your task force.

24:07.404 --> 24:10.272
It doesn't exist. And we found out,
he started shooting at us.

24:10.449 --> 24:14.193
- Looked like you were shooting at him.
- Reuther is pretending to be Surkov.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.861
That's ridiculous.

24:16.038 --> 24:19.372
When you found us, we were hunting
for his weapons maker.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.625
Looking to interrogate him to find Surkov.

24:25.255 --> 24:28.623
Do you know
how I got Ghaffari to talk so quickly?

24:29.218 --> 24:30.834
I told him Surkov was dead.

24:31.011 --> 24:35.551
No proof, just the word of my source.
Minute I told him, he knew it was true.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.966
Calhoun, there's a bomb in Virginia...

24:38.143 --> 24:40.180
...waiting to be detonated
in Surkov's name.

24:40.354 --> 24:44.189
- Reuther is going to detonate it.
- Tobias Reuther is a patriot.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.315
- He's a terrorist.
- He loves his country.

24:46.485 --> 24:50.820
If you don't tell us where to find him,
he'll commit an act of terror.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.611
Do you trust your intel on Surkov?

24:57.788 --> 25:00.246
- Hundred percent.
- And Ghaffari's weapon?

25:00.416 --> 25:02.954
We're working with Virginia police
and law enforcement.

25:03.127 --> 25:06.336
- But it's a big state with a lot of lockers.
- What about Calhoun?

25:06.505 --> 25:08.963
She thought she was working
for an agency task force.

25:09.133 --> 25:13.218
She had no idea the man she admires
is the devil she was hunting.

25:13.804 --> 25:16.763
I always thought Surkov's death
would be cause for celebration.

25:16.932 --> 25:21.643
But if he is dead and a group
of CIA-trained assets has taken his place...

25:22.479 --> 25:23.811
Sir?

25:23.981 --> 25:25.472
Director Cox, hello.

25:25.649 --> 25:29.984
The only prints they could pull
from the safe house were partials.

25:30.154 --> 25:33.488
But we got a match.
The man we're looking for, Reuther...

25:33.657 --> 25:37.150
...his real name is Agent Brian Osterman.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.486
That name mean anything?

25:41.540 --> 25:44.783
Director Cox, who is Brian Osterman?

25:51.175 --> 25:54.043
- Cheer up. I'm in your debt.
- A lot good that will do me...

25:54.219 --> 25:57.053
- ...if anyone finds out I did this.
- Yes, yes, yes.

25:57.222 --> 26:00.056
Giving me this evidence is vital
and much appreciated.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.592
- "Giving"?
- But what Coco and I have been up to...

26:02.770 --> 26:04.682
- ...is a revelation.
- I need that back...

26:04.855 --> 26:09.190
- ...before anyone knows it's missing.
- She's always welcome for a grooming.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.726
- I gotta return that.
- And her ointments.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.487
- Ointments?
- "Ointments." Funny word.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.899
Twice a day.
Three times on her inner folds.

26:18.077 --> 26:21.366
Coco, the pleasure was all mine,
sweetheart.

26:41.141 --> 26:44.976
- The suitcase key.
- So Kate entrusted it to Nik.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.011
But who did Nik entrust it to?

26:47.189 --> 26:49.806
And why did he get killed for it?

26:53.612 --> 26:55.979
And who might you be?

27:05.457 --> 27:07.949
Brian Osterman was one of our own.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.540
One we no longer consider
a trusted asset.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.624
He was part of a black-book operation...

27:12.798 --> 27:15.791
...tasked to ID threats
to U.S. counterintelligence.

27:15.968 --> 27:20.053
But in '08, he broke from the agency,
and we issued a burn notice.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.930
- That's not possible.
- He became disillusioned.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.308
He's been off the grid for six years.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.343
If Surkov is in fact dead...

27:27.521 --> 27:30.229
...and Osterman is carrying out
missions in his name...

27:30.399 --> 27:32.482
...we're dealing
with a very dangerous man.

27:32.651 --> 27:36.315
One you have assisted in carrying out
attacks against this country.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.526
Reuther, he had HUMINT and funding.

27:39.700 --> 27:43.319
Pilfered from a black-ops slush fund
that went missing.

27:45.998 --> 27:49.708
The others, the team.
He recruited us to the agency.

27:49.877 --> 27:52.995
He lied to you, to get you
to help him attack the U.S.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.210
You and your team are Ilyas Surkov.
You didn't know it.

27:56.383 --> 27:59.547
But you do now,
and you can help us stop him.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.970
We have a staging area in Ivy City.

28:07.144 --> 28:08.931
I can take you there.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.310
There's another door.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.399
I don't believe this.

28:19.573 --> 28:20.939
Nothing here.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.073
Take your team back.

28:32.169 --> 28:35.412
- The safe house has been scrubbed.
- Nothing on Osterman or his team?

28:35.589 --> 28:39.128
Just empty files stamped "Cyclone."
That's it.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.088
That name means nothing to you?

28:41.261 --> 28:43.799
- Osterman? Nothing.
<i>- He's in the wind...</i>

28:43.972 --> 28:47.136
...with a weapon we can't find
and a target that could be anywhere.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.596
That's what you don't know.
Focus on what you do.

28:49.770 --> 28:54.014
We know the weapon was designed
to pierce Kevlar, plus the Cyclone files.

28:54.191 --> 28:57.775
It could be a code name,
a mission, a person?

28:57.945 --> 29:00.688
Any point of intersection?
Kevlar? Cyclone?

29:00.864 --> 29:02.730
<i>Where they happen? Coastal cities?</i>

29:02.908 --> 29:05.321
Law enforcement in those areas
that wear Kevlar?

29:05.494 --> 29:09.204
What else?
"Cyclone," if it's not a person or place?

29:09.373 --> 29:12.992
It's a target,
not law enforcement but military.

29:13.168 --> 29:15.785
A target hard enough to design
a weapon to penetrate it.

29:15.963 --> 29:18.421
<i>- Not steel but Kevlar.</i>
- Good.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.174
A military hard target made
of a composite material.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.631
I need to call you back.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.223
Aram, I need you to run a search.

29:29.393 --> 29:32.636
Any ships in the Navy,
Coast Guard, whoever the Pentagon...

29:32.813 --> 29:37.979
...has built ships with the name "Cyclone"
that are made of material similar to Kevlar.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.687
All right. Hang on.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.319
Okay, I have a Cyclone-class patrol ship.

29:42.489 --> 29:46.108
- Tell me about them.
<i>- Fourteen ships. Ten in the Persian Gulf.</i>

29:46.285 --> 29:50.370
Three are doing drug interdiction
off of Florida. And this last one...

29:50.539 --> 29:53.623
Okay, yeah,
the <i>U. S.S. Parnell</i> is at its home port.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.749
- Where is that?
- Norfolk.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.622
Virginia.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.876
- Dried toast, that's it?
- All most people can keep down.

30:05.053 --> 30:08.091
Probably because most people
take the full dose.

30:08.682 --> 30:11.345
- A clinical trial must be...
- I'm not here for the trial.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.135
- If it's drugs...
- I'm here for information...

30:14.313 --> 30:16.145
...on Pete McGee.

30:18.275 --> 30:21.643
- You'll need to sign a discharge.
- He had family photos in his office...

30:21.820 --> 30:23.982
...but only one
where he could always see it.

30:24.156 --> 30:27.365
I didn't think there was anything special
about it till I realized...

30:27.534 --> 30:30.948
...that it was taken
by someone very special to him.

30:31.788 --> 30:35.031
- It's not what you think.
- He took something from me.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.495
Something that is only
gonna bring him trouble.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.120
- What?
- Something I was willing to put that...

30:40.297 --> 30:42.789
...in my veins to get back.
I need it back.

30:43.759 --> 30:47.002
- I'm sorry.
- I came to find what he took from me...

30:47.179 --> 30:51.139
...or at least get a lead on where he went,
but all I found was you.

30:51.308 --> 30:52.890
And I'm asking you...

30:53.060 --> 30:55.222
...I need your help.

30:55.395 --> 30:58.433
And if I'm right, I think Pete does too.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.813
Discharge nurse should be in shortly.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.288
Aram, we're on site. Talk to me.

31:16.458 --> 31:19.292
I've notified port authority
and Naval Installations Command.

31:19.461 --> 31:24.081
They're initiating lockdown and evac
for all nonessential personnel.

31:24.257 --> 31:27.841
- Any word on Osterman?
- Nothing. I'm waiting for approval...

31:28.011 --> 31:30.378
...from Security Command
to share their CCTV feeds.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.138
Matthew O'Neil, NCIS.
What do you know?

31:33.308 --> 31:36.392
There's a threat against your ship,
the <i>U. S.S. Parnell.</i>

31:36.561 --> 31:38.974
We gotta lock this down,
clear all this air traffic.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.810
Transport runs a flight every six minutes.

31:41.983 --> 31:45.021
Keen, I may have something here.
NCIS just got a ping...

31:45.195 --> 31:48.359
...on an alias Calhoun was able
to confirm was one of Osterman's.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.319
Access has been granted...

31:50.492 --> 31:54.486
...to a Human Resources office
between Powhatan Ave and Pier 11.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.385
Stand down, Osterman.

32:19.813 --> 32:22.647
You have no idea
what you're in the middle of.

32:22.816 --> 32:25.354
We know about you,
about Surkov, your team.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.355
- It's over.
- Surkov's dead.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.236
I'm not using him as cover.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.318
- CIA is.
- I said, stand down.

32:31.491 --> 32:34.029
When an asset reported
Surkov had died from cancer...

32:34.202 --> 32:37.286
...Cox thought we could use his name
to do America's dirty work.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.072
- Cox?
- I was on board at first.

32:39.249 --> 32:41.206
Pretty soon it became clear...

32:41.376 --> 32:44.835
...the jobs we were doing,
we weren't doing America's dirty work.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.713
We were doing Cox's. That he'd turned.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.717
I tried to pull the plug,
but Cox discredited me.

32:50.886 --> 32:54.175
Convinced our superiors
to issue a burn notice.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.176
Did I lie to my team?

32:56.349 --> 32:57.840
Did I lie to you?

32:58.018 --> 32:59.259
Yes.

32:59.436 --> 33:02.725
Because none of you would believe
the truth. Cox has to be stopped.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.355
Step away from your weapon.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.891
<i>Got him. He's at your 11. It's him.</i>

33:07.819 --> 33:10.482
See that man down there
with a black backpack?

33:10.655 --> 33:15.741
He's a CIA asset here to plant
the bomb Cox bought from Ghaffari.

33:15.911 --> 33:19.120
- My team is here to stop him.
<i>- Have a shot? Take it.</i>

33:19.289 --> 33:22.077
Why blow up a chemical plant?
An American ship?

33:22.250 --> 33:25.493
- False-flag operations.
- Even if you're telling the truth...

33:25.670 --> 33:28.083
...you're asking me
to let you shoot a CIA agent...

33:28.256 --> 33:30.919
- ...who's following orders.
<i>- Take your shot.</i>

33:31.092 --> 33:34.381
- It's your last chance.
- Gonna shoot me in the head?

33:37.516 --> 33:40.554
I have Osterman in custody.
Human Resources, third floor.

33:40.727 --> 33:44.266
We're gonna need a medic.
Alert NCIS of a potential suspect.

33:44.439 --> 33:48.774
An officer in uniform, brown hair,
medium build, with a black backpack.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.230
Looks like you were wrong.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.451
You believe me now?

34:13.592 --> 34:14.629
<i>You lied to me.</i>

34:14.803 --> 34:18.513
Osterman isn't the imposter.
He was hunting the imposter. You.

34:19.808 --> 34:23.347
Osterman is a rogue agent who's
acted against our national interests.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.137
- That ship was never your target.
- No.

34:26.313 --> 34:28.806
The blast severed
an undersea communications cable...

34:28.984 --> 34:32.148
...running from the naval station
to our allies across the Atlantic.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.108
A cable compromised
by Chinese counterintelligence.

34:35.282 --> 34:39.447
If we had simply ceased sending intel,
it would've tipped our hand.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.827
So you sacrificed one of your agents.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.705
It was a directional device.
My agent survived.

34:44.873 --> 34:47.536
As have all agents I've tasked
with taking out enemies.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.704
- Like the plant foreman in Leeds?
- He was leaking intel...

34:50.880 --> 34:53.588
...from one of our military contractors
to Russian assets.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.755
Our team hid the ops
behind Surkov attacks.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.762
In both cases, we avoided
escalating international conflicts.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.890
- At what cost?
- At any cost, Harold.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.893
I hate to disappoint you,
but I see things differently.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.598
I see diplomatic solutions.

35:07.772 --> 35:11.812
I see a way to get results
without false-flag operations.

35:11.985 --> 35:15.945
We both know a terrified population
means a healthy defense budget.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.949
Are you trying to tell me
that you've done everything by the book?

35:20.118 --> 35:23.407
No cut corners,
no bent rules, for the greater good?

35:23.580 --> 35:28.666
I answer to people who judge the merits
of my work. I'll accept the consequences.

35:28.835 --> 35:32.249
You have been operating
without oversight until now.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.960
I've given my superiors a full overview.

35:35.133 --> 35:39.548
I hope they agree that your actions
were in America's best interests.

35:39.721 --> 35:41.007
I doubt they will.

35:42.265 --> 35:44.382
Time will tell.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.846
Close the door on your way out.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.912
You have done more harm
than you could know.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.039
I'm counting on it.

36:09.209 --> 36:11.952
And it'll be worth it if it stops you.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.584
You're here.

37:05.348 --> 37:09.388
So many people find cemeteries
to be a reminder of loss.

37:09.561 --> 37:13.771
I find them to be a fervent reminder
to seize the day.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.897
I'm surprised to see you here.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.775
Nik Korpal saved my life.

37:18.945 --> 37:21.483
Brought Agnes into this world.

37:21.656 --> 37:24.023
Came to pay my respects.

37:25.034 --> 37:27.117
How are you holding up?

37:29.164 --> 37:30.871
I've been better.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.203
About how he died...

37:39.841 --> 37:42.128
...did you find anything out?

37:53.897 --> 37:56.310
Reddington was a surprise.

37:58.401 --> 38:01.269
He appreciates what Nik's done for him.

38:01.446 --> 38:04.280
And knows Nik may have been killed
because of it.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.532
He's willing to look into who did it.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.072
He is?

38:10.246 --> 38:12.158
- Has he found anything?
- Not yet.

38:12.332 --> 38:14.449
But it sounds like he has a lead.

38:15.877 --> 38:18.790
What kind of lead?
Was he more specific?

38:22.425 --> 38:25.133
I've lost so many friends.

38:27.972 --> 38:33.218
I don't know if I can lose any more
without just crawling into a fetal position...

38:33.394 --> 38:36.637
...or becoming a stark, raving vigilante.

38:38.983 --> 38:42.693
Listen, Reddington's a vigilante.

38:43.238 --> 38:47.357
All right? And I'm pretty sure
there's a one-per-family rule.

38:53.498 --> 38:56.332
I think Meera is buried here.

38:57.252 --> 39:00.620
- I'd like to pay my respects.
- All right.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.880
You want company?

39:03.049 --> 39:05.416
I'd like to go alone if you don't mind.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.889
<i>The explosion rocked the yard.</i>

39:13.059 --> 39:14.971
<i>While no casualties
have been reported...</i>

39:15.144 --> 39:18.512
<i>...Ilyas Surkov has claimed credit
for the attack.</i>

39:22.151 --> 39:23.642
Okay...

39:24.487 --> 39:26.729
About what happened in Belgrade.

39:26.906 --> 39:30.274
- What part?
- When Agent Navabi was taken.

39:31.661 --> 39:35.575
She could have been hurt.
She wasn't. She's fine, obviously.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.665
But...

39:39.127 --> 39:41.744
...I wasn't prepared, sir.

39:42.589 --> 39:44.672
I didn't know how to react.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.800
- Then the shootout at the safe house...
- Aram.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.757
I understand.

39:50.930 --> 39:54.844
It was an oversight on my part
to place you in danger like I did.

39:55.018 --> 39:58.682
- It won't happen again.
- No, no, I don't wanna be unprepared.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.472
Mr. Cooper.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.185
Sir.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.569
I'd like to request
to be operationally trained.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.314
- Sir.
<i>- What changed your mind?</i>

40:11.117 --> 40:14.281
You said he might be in trouble
What kind of trouble?

40:14.996 --> 40:16.612
He might've killed someone.

40:17.165 --> 40:19.578
Pete? I don't believe that.

40:19.751 --> 40:23.165
Listen, what he took from me,
people are getting killed.

40:23.338 --> 40:28.458
And whether he did or didn't do it,
just by having it, his life is in danger.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.048
Are you looking to protect him
or have him arrested?

40:34.223 --> 40:37.887
I don't know you. I'm not gonna take
what you say about Pete at face value.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.723
No way he killed anyone.

40:40.355 --> 40:44.269
<i>Whatever he took from you,
he must have a good reason why.</i>

40:44.442 --> 40:47.401
<i>He hasn't been to work in a week.
He hasn't called.</i>

40:47.570 --> 40:51.029
<i>His divorce will be finalized next month,
and we'll get married.</i>

40:51.199 --> 40:53.612
<i>I'm worried
something might have happened.</i>

40:53.785 --> 40:56.778
I changed my mind
because I want him found.

40:56.955 --> 41:00.369
Whatever your reason is
for wanting to do that, I don't care...

41:00.541 --> 41:02.328
...as long as you're willing to help.

41:03.336 --> 41:06.374
Tell me everything you can about Pete.

41:07.215 --> 41:11.209
Friends, relatives,
cities he likes, passwords.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.920
Everything.

41:15.723 --> 41:16.759
Yeah.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.390
This rug was a gift.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.892
My aunt crocheted it herself.

41:21.062 --> 41:23.429
It's gotta go and the allergies with it.

41:23.606 --> 41:26.269
This, my space, it's a critter-free zone.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.274
It's a critter cabin.

41:28.444 --> 41:29.901
Not in here, it's not.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.318
That's six hold lists' worth.

41:36.744 --> 41:39.908
Are you African?
Because you're a freaking babe.

41:40.081 --> 41:42.323
Can you handle that?

41:42.500 --> 41:44.708
I can handle whatever you got.

41:52.301 --> 41:54.634
The person who answers
may not know the secret.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.921
No, but they might.

42:01.477 --> 42:04.811
Wonder what can of worms
we're opening now.

42:11.612 --> 42:12.648
Hello?

42:17.952 --> 42:18.988
Who is this?
