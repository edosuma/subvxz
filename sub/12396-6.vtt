WEBVTT

00:06.170 --> 00:07.797
- PREVIOUSLY ON PSYCH...

00:07.840 --> 00:10.104
- I HOPE YOU WEREN'T SAVING
THIS STOOL FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.801
- DO I KNOW YOU?

00:11.840 --> 00:13.034
- OH!

00:13.080 --> 00:14.672
- MARLOWE VICCELLIO.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.076
- HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

00:17.110 --> 00:18.577
I FELT SOMETHING.

00:18.610 --> 00:19.770
- SO DID I.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.344
THE ONLY THING
IT COMPARES TO

00:21.380 --> 00:22.779
IS THE RUSH OF JUBILATION
I FELT

00:22.820 --> 00:24.219
WHEN I HEARD
CHUCK NORRIS SPEAK

00:24.250 --> 00:26.559
AT AN NRA CONVENTION
IN ABERDEEN.

00:26.590 --> 00:27.818
[pounding on door]

00:27.860 --> 00:30.055
- MARLOWE VICCELLIO,
THIS IS THE POLICE.

00:30.090 --> 00:31.819
- OKAY, SO I DID
TAKE THE BLOOD,

00:31.860 --> 00:34.397
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
I'M TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

00:34.430 --> 00:36.489
BUT I PROMISE,
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

00:36.530 --> 00:38.566
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
- WHAT?

00:38.600 --> 00:40.329
- MARLOWE, I WOULD MOVE HEAVEN
AND EARTH TO BE WITH YOU,

00:40.370 --> 00:42.361
JUST AS LONG AS
THAT MOVEMENT'S IN ACCORDANCE

00:42.410 --> 00:44.264
WITH THE STATE LAWS
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.440
- SEE YA, MARLOWE!

00:59.190 --> 01:00.214
- OOH, GIRL, GO GET HIM!

01:00.260 --> 01:02.581
- [laughs]

01:02.630 --> 01:05.827
- [grunts]
- OH!

01:05.860 --> 01:07.794
MMM!

01:18.670 --> 01:20.535
- [groans]

01:20.580 --> 01:23.469
[gasping]

01:23.510 --> 01:25.398
- ARE YOU SHAWN SPENCER?

01:25.450 --> 01:27.771
- [exhales]

01:27.820 --> 01:29.242
- MY NAME IS ZOLA.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.643
I AM A CONTORTIONIST
WITH LE CIRQUE.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.248
- OH, A CONTORTIONIST.

01:32.290 --> 01:34.281
AH, WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
HOW YOU WERE ABLE TO SLIP IN

01:34.320 --> 01:38.256
WHILE I WAS DOING A PULL--
I MEAN, 150 PULL-UPS.

01:38.290 --> 01:39.894
- ACTUALLY, YOU WERE
KICKING YOUR LEGS SO WIDE,

01:39.930 --> 01:41.795
IT WAS EASY TO WALK
UNDERNEATH.

01:41.830 --> 01:43.161
- MAN, YOU KNOW
YOU COULD HAVE HELPED ME.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.738
- I AM THE ONE
IN NEED OF HELP.

01:46.770 --> 01:47.589
TWO WEEKS AGO,

01:47.640 --> 01:49.232
OUR STAR PERFORMER,
FRANCOIS ANGELO,

01:49.270 --> 01:52.478
STARTED ACTING ANXIOUS,
ALMOST PARANOID.

01:52.510 --> 01:54.876
I FEAR HE'S IN TROUBLE.

01:54.910 --> 01:56.571
CAN YOU PSYCHICALLY
FIND HIM?

01:56.610 --> 01:58.202
- HERE'S THE THING.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.139
UM, MY PSYCHIC POWERS
GENERALLY DON'T KICK IN

02:01.180 --> 02:03.182
UNTIL SOMEONE'S BEEN MISSING
FOR 48 HOURS,

02:03.220 --> 02:04.710
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THAT PERSON IS EDDIE MURPHY,

02:04.750 --> 02:06.479
FROM THE MOVIE 48 HOURS,

02:06.520 --> 02:08.158
BUT SADLY, I FEAR
HE'S LOST FOREVER.

02:08.190 --> 02:09.657
- HMM.

02:09.690 --> 02:11.157
- UH, YOU LET ME KNOW
IF YOUR BUDDY FRANCOIS

02:11.190 --> 02:12.293
IS MISSING IN A COUPLE DAYS.

02:12.330 --> 02:13.490
WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.

02:13.530 --> 02:14.724
- OH, NO.
I WILL WAIT HERE.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.558
- GO BACK TO YOUR PULL-UP.

02:19.870 --> 02:21.861
- [clears throat]

02:26.840 --> 02:29.377
I TELL YOU WHAT.
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS.

02:29.410 --> 02:32.174
- OH! THANK YOU SO MUCH,
SHAWN SPENCER.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.676
UH, YOU SHOULD COME

02:33.720 --> 02:35.369
TO TODAY'S DRESS REHEARSAL
BEFORE THE SHOW.

02:35.420 --> 02:37.513
MAYBE YOU CAN DIVINE
SOMETHING THERE, NO?

02:37.550 --> 02:38.847
- BACKSTAGE PASS?
- UH-HUH.

02:38.890 --> 02:41.950
- GREAT.
- YEAH. MERCI.

02:41.990 --> 02:43.480
THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.885
- [laughs]

02:45.930 --> 02:48.296
- SOME MORE RISING, HUH?
- KEEP TRYING.

02:48.330 --> 02:50.867
- I DO, LIKE,
100 OF THESE A DAY.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.460
[sighs]

02:53.500 --> 02:54.728
[exhales]

02:54.770 --> 03:00.834
[groaning]

03:04.980 --> 03:06.971
- REALLY?

03:07.020 --> 03:10.285
- MAXIMUS?
WHAT ARE YOU DO--

03:10.320 --> 03:11.742
- HEY, SHAWN.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.951
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?
[laughs]

03:13.990 --> 03:17.448
WHAT'S UP, RACH?
RAY-RAY?

03:17.490 --> 03:19.219
CH EL?

03:19.260 --> 03:21.797
PROFESSOR WILLARD
DICK PETER JOHNSON.

03:21.830 --> 03:23.468
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH "RACHAEL"?

03:23.500 --> 03:24.922
IT'S A CLASSIC GIRL'S NAME,
LIKE "SHAWN."

03:24.970 --> 03:27.564
- [laughs]
RAY-RAY.

03:27.600 --> 03:32.230
MAXIMUS, MY MAN.
BOOM! WHO'S DA--PSSH!

03:32.280 --> 03:35.534
- YEAH, BOY.
WHO GOT THE BALL?

03:35.580 --> 03:36.899
- UH, YOU KNOW,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT MAX.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.269
HE'S ALWAYS
TOUGH ON PEOPLE

03:38.310 --> 03:39.572
UNTIL HE REALLY
GETS TO KNOW THEM.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.440
- REALLY?
I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.879
I HAVE A KILLER DAY
PLANNED.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.787
HE IS GONNA LOVE IT.
- OF COURSE HE WILL.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.378
NOW, HERE IS EVERYTHING
YOU NEED.

03:47.420 --> 03:48.910
AND REMEMBER, IF YOU RUN
OUT OF THINGS TO TALK ABOUT,

03:48.960 --> 03:50.257
YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG
WITH STAR WARS.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.587
- THE ORIGINAL
OR PREQUELS?

03:51.630 --> 03:52.824
- COME ON, SON.

03:52.860 --> 03:54.350

[laughter]

03:58.930 --> 04:00.966

WHAT IS THIS?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.537
SHE'S DOING OUR "COME ON, SONS"?
- NO.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.606
- OH, SHAWN, DON'T BE SUCH
A FILIPINO STEVE PERRY.

04:05.640 --> 04:06.834
[laughter]

04:06.880 --> 04:08.336
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

04:08.380 --> 04:10.678
- WATCH YOUR BOO
DO HIS THING.

04:10.710 --> 04:12.268
HEY, LITI'LE MAN.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.776
WHICH ONE OF THESE FUN THINGS
YOU WANT TO DO

04:13.820 --> 04:18.484
FOR OUR BIG BOY DAY?

04:18.520 --> 04:19.851
THE PLANETARIUM?
- MM-MM.

04:19.890 --> 04:20.811
- THE AQUARIUM?

04:20.860 --> 04:22.384

04:22.430 --> 04:24.523

YEAR-ROUND VILLAGE?

04:25.960 --> 04:27.359

04:27.400 --> 04:28.856

04:30.370 --> 04:32.588

04:32.640 --> 04:33.789
- YEAH, THE CIRCUS.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.467
LE CIRQUE?

04:35.500 --> 04:36.967
WHO'S GONNA STAY UP
WITH HIM ALL NIGHT

04:37.010 --> 04:38.432
WHEN HE'S HAVING NIGHTMARES
ABOUT THE CLOWNS

04:38.470 --> 04:39.676
AND THE FREAKY-FREAKS
IN THE SHOW?

04:39.710 --> 04:41.007
- I WILL.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.940
NOT THAT ME AND YOUR MOM
ARE HAVING ANY SLEEPOVERS.

04:42.980 --> 04:45.346
- PLEASE, MOM?

04:45.380 --> 04:47.541
- LOOK, IT'LL BE FINE.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.889
I PROMISE,
HE'S IN GREAT HANDS.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.085
- WHAT?
IT'S THE CIRCUS, KID.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.394
- WHAT? WHAT?

04:59.430 --> 05:01.853
UH, SHAWN,
I THOUGHT THAT YOU SAID

05:01.900 --> 05:03.891
WE WERE GOING
TO THE LE CIRQUE SHOW.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.864
- YEAH. THIS IS
A DRESS REHEARSAL.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.539
- YES, BUT WE PROMISED MAX THAT
HE WOULD BE SEEING THE SHOW.

05:08.570 --> 05:10.106
- AND HE WILL.

05:10.140 --> 05:14.702
JUST WITHOUT ALL THE UNNECESSARY
EXCITEMENT AND ENTERTAINMENT.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.799
NOW, WHAT IS JEFFREY DUKE
DOING HERE?

05:16.850 --> 05:19.717
- WHO?
- REALLY? JEFFREY DUKE?

05:19.750 --> 05:21.741
HE MAKES THE MERCEDES
OF PORT-O-POTI'IES,

05:21.780 --> 05:24.578
AND I SHOULD KNOW
BECAUSE I'VE PEED IN BOTH.

05:24.620 --> 05:27.851
HE'S ALSO ONE OF THE MOST
RUTHLESS WISE GUYS AROUND.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.528
HE'S THE GO'I'I'I OF PO'ITIES.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.721
HE'S THE DON
OF THE JOHNS.

05:31.760 --> 05:32.988
HE'S--HE'S NUMBER ONE
AT GOING--

05:33.030 --> 05:35.590
- SHAWN.

05:35.630 --> 05:37.564
- HEY, DOES THAT GUY
LOOK SUSPICIOUS TO YOU?

05:37.600 --> 05:38.897
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

05:38.930 --> 05:40.989
IT'S LIKE
WE'RE ON AN INVESTIGATION.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.009
OH, MY GOSH.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.564
WE ARE ON AN INVESTIGATION,
AREN'T WE?

05:45.610 --> 05:46.929
- DEFINE "INVESTIGATION."
- UNBELIEVABLE.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.629
- NO, THAT IS THE DEFINITION
OF "NOT BELIEVABLE."

05:48.680 --> 05:49.908
- AND ALL THIS TIME,

05:49.950 --> 05:51.599
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST
TRYING TO HELP ME OUT.

05:51.650 --> 05:52.947
DID IT EVER EVEN
OCCUR TO YOU

05:52.980 --> 05:54.709
THAT THIS MIGHT PUT ME
IN TROUBLE WITH RACHAEL?

05:54.750 --> 05:56.069
AND WHAT ABOUT IF SOMETHING
HAD HAPPENED TO MAX?

05:56.120 --> 05:57.940
- OH, PLEASE.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.412
MAY GOD STRIKE ME DEAD

05:59.460 --> 06:01.849
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO THIS KID, OKAY?

06:06.660 --> 06:10.960
- [hyperventilating]

06:11.000 --> 06:13.992
- OH, I HOPE
THIS GOES WELL.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.462
- OH, YOU JUST RELAX

06:15.500 --> 06:17.468
AND LET YOUR HONEYBEAR
TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

06:17.510 --> 06:18.966
ONCE YOUR PAROLE OFFICER

06:19.010 --> 06:20.898
SEES THAT HE'S DEALING
WITH ONE OF HIS BRETHREN,

06:20.940 --> 06:22.976
IT WILL BE SMOOTH SAILING
FROM HERE ON OUT.

06:23.010 --> 06:24.477
- OKAY.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.841
- WE CAN FINALLY
GET ON WITH OUR LIVES.

06:25.880 --> 06:26.949
- [chuckles]

06:26.980 --> 06:29.540
- READY?
- YES.

06:33.190 --> 06:34.953
WHAT?
- THAT'S URSULA GIBBS.

06:34.990 --> 06:37.129
- OH, SO YOU KNOW HER?
EVEN BE'ITER.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.459
- WELL...
OKAY, HERE'S THE THING.

06:40.500 --> 06:45.858
UM, I MIGHT HAVE
HOOKED UP

06:45.900 --> 06:47.162
WITH URSULA
A FEW YEARS BACK

06:47.200 --> 06:48.895
AFI'ER AN INTER-DEPARTMENTAL
DRINK MIXER

06:48.940 --> 06:54.003
AND I MIGHT HAVE NOT EVER
CALLED HER AFI'ERWARDS

06:54.040 --> 06:57.601
WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED
THAT SHE MIGHT BE

06:57.650 --> 07:00.915
AN OBSESSIVE, VINDICT IVE,
VENGEFUL LOON.

07:00.950 --> 07:02.588
- STILL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
CALLED HER.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.918
- I THINK
IT WOULD BE BEST

07:04.950 --> 07:07.919
IF SHE DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE MY GIRLFRIEND.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.087
- AH, GOT IT.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.598
- SO I'M HERE,
ASSISTING MS. VICCELLIO

07:12.630 --> 07:13.892
ON A PROFESSIONAL BASIS.

07:13.930 --> 07:16.467
I WAS INVOLVED
IN HER INITIAL CRIMINAL CASE,

07:16.500 --> 07:17.865
AND I CAN A'I'I'EST
TO THE FACT

07:17.900 --> 07:20.061
THAT SHE IS COMPLETELY
REHABILITATED.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.500
- HMM. I SEE.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.906
I'LL TAKE YOUR PROFESSIONAL
ENDORSEMENT INTO CONSIDERATION

07:24.940 --> 07:27.829
WHEN DETERMINING
THE CONDITIONS OF PAROLE.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.769
THE FIRST ITEM TO DEAL WITH
IS PLACE OF RESIDENCE.

07:30.810 --> 07:34.746
MS. VICCELLIO IS FREE TO LIVE
WHEREVER IN THE CITY SHE WANTS,

07:34.780 --> 07:39.581
WITHIN
A 15.7-SQUARE-MILE AREA.

07:39.620 --> 07:41.611
- WHY THE .7?

07:41.660 --> 07:45.027
- OH.

07:45.060 --> 07:48.154
- THAT STOPS JUST
400 FEET SHORT OF MY HOUSE.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.862
YOU FOUND OUT WE'RE A COUPLE,
DIDN'T YOU?

07:50.900 --> 07:52.265
- MUST HAVE BEEN HARD
TO COMMUNICATE

07:52.300 --> 07:54.894
WHILE SHE WAS IN PRISON.

07:54.940 --> 07:55.998
I GUESS
THE PHONES IN YOUR HOUSE

07:56.040 --> 07:58.201
SUDDENLY
STARTED WORKING AGAIN.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.707
WHO KNEW?

07:59.740 --> 08:01.970
- YOU VENGEFUL LITTLE--

08:02.010 --> 08:04.570
- NOW, WE MOVE ON
TO RESTRICTIONS.

08:04.610 --> 08:08.148
NO ALCOHOL, NO STAYING OUT
PAST 10:00 P.M.,

08:08.180 --> 08:10.887
NO NON-SPOUSAL
CO-HABITATION.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.683
- OH, YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.813
- LET'S NOT MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
HONEYBEAR.

08:14.860 --> 08:17.886
- MM-MM. NO COMBINING
"HONEY" AND "BEAR."

08:17.930 --> 08:18.988
[cell phone rings]

08:19.030 --> 08:20.099
- LOOK, WE GO'I'I'A RELAX,
OKAY?

08:20.130 --> 08:21.654
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM,

08:21.700 --> 08:23.019
AND RACHAEL'S GONNA BE
NONE THE WISER.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.298
- IT'S HER NOW.
WHAT DO I DO?

08:24.330 --> 08:25.888
- GIVE ME THE PHONE.
I DO A PERFECT MAXIMUS.

08:25.930 --> 08:28.592
- NO WAY.
HELLO?

08:28.640 --> 08:30.961
- BURTON, I KNOW I'M BEING
ONE OF THOSE PARENTS,

08:31.010 --> 08:32.898
BUT I'M JUST CHECKING TO MAKE
SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

08:32.940 --> 08:36.034
- [high-pitched] HI, MOMMY.
I'M HAVING A BIG BOY--UHH!

08:36.080 --> 08:37.877
- WHO WAS THAT?
- [groans]

08:37.910 --> 08:39.969
THAT WAS TOO HARSH!
- WHAT WAS TOO HARSH?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.578
WHO WAS THAT?
- NO ONE.

08:41.620 --> 08:43.212
LOOK, I'M SO SORRY,

08:43.250 --> 08:45.980
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO HANG UP
ON YOU NOW.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.317
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU HAVE TO HANG UP ON ME?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.316
- GET OVER HERE.
- GUS, WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:49.360 --> 08:51.920
- QUICK. SAY SOMETHING TO GIVE
YOUR MOM PROOF OF LIFE.

08:51.960 --> 08:55.589
- WHAT?
- THAT'LL DO. BYE, SWEETIE.

08:55.630 --> 08:59.088
- WHAT'S UP, KID?

09:00.970 --> 09:02.164
- ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.168
READY FOR
FINAL TAG RUN-THROUGH.

09:04.210 --> 09:10.206
[indistinct chatter]

09:12.050 --> 09:17.579
- [gaSPSI

09:17.620 --> 09:20.054
- TEN SECONDS TILL IT'S TIME.
CLEAR THE LANE.

09:20.090 --> 09:22.888
- SEE, MAN?
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.659
- NO, EVERYTHING
IS NOT ALL RIGHT.

09:24.690 --> 09:25.884
I'M STILL MAD AT YOU

09:25.930 --> 09:27.921
FOR BRINGING HIM
ON AN INVESTIGATION.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.009
- FRANCOIS IS READY.
ON MY CUE.

09:37.040 --> 09:41.136
- FRANCOIS? DUDE, THAT'S
THE GUY WE WERE HIRED TO FIND.

09:41.180 --> 09:43.944
THAT MEANS THIS IS
NO LONGER AN INVESTIGATION.

09:43.980 --> 09:45.607
WE'RE JUST TWO DUDES

09:45.650 --> 09:47.072
AND THE FRUIT
OF ANOTHER MAN'S LOINS,

09:47.120 --> 09:48.917
WATCHING LE CIRQUE

09:48.950 --> 09:51.145
AND EATING SOME DELICIOUS
SNYDER'S PRETZELS.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.010
WHAT ELSE COULD BE BE'ITER?

09:53.060 --> 09:56.086
- FRANCOIS, STAND BY
FOR TRAPEZE LAUNCH.

09:56.120 --> 10:01.126
AT THREE, TWO, ONE,
AND ACTION.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.892
[onlookers gasp]
[thud]

10:07.940 --> 10:08.895
- SOMEBODY CALL
AN AMBULANCE.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.864
- THAT'S JUST
PART OF THE ACT.

10:11.910 --> 10:14.879
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

10:14.910 --> 10:18.209
*

10:18.250 --> 10:22.072
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

10:22.120 --> 10:25.840
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

10:25.890 --> 10:27.016
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

10:27.060 --> 10:28.755
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

10:28.790 --> 10:32.021
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

10:32.060 --> 10:34.028
-*OOH

10:34.060 --> 10:37.097
- * YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

10:39.740 --> 10:42.903

THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

10:42.940 --> 10:46.774
* I KNOW YOU KNOW THEY JUST
DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

10:58.950 --> 11:00.258
- HE SAW SOMEONE GET KILLED.

11:00.290 --> 11:04.750
- SEE, SEE,
WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS--

11:04.790 --> 11:07.998
WAIT, NOW. YOU'RE NOT
LE'I'I'ING ME FINISH.

11:08.030 --> 11:09.156
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.827
I SEE YOUR POINT,
BUT, I MEAN,

11:10.870 --> 11:13.998
WE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH
ON THIS ALL DAY,

11:14.040 --> 11:16.907
[stammering] BUT I THINK
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,

11:16.940 --> 11:18.862
IS THAT MAX IS FINE.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.036
- FINE?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.308
HE'S BEEN GRILLING ME

11:21.340 --> 11:23.308
ABOUT WHERE CIRCUS PERFORMERS GO
WHEN THEY DIE.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.978
- [laughs]
LIKE THEY HAVE SOULS.

11:26.010 --> 11:28.114
- LOOK, YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:28.150 --> 11:29.981
WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER
TAKEN MAX.

11:30.020 --> 11:33.911
IT WAS JUST A MISCOMMUNICATION
BETWEEN ME AND SHAWN.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.951
I PROMISE TO BE MORE CAREFUL
NEXT TIME.

11:35.990 --> 11:37.127
- I DON'T THINK
THERE'S GONNA BE

11:37.160 --> 11:40.755
ANY MORE BIG BOY DAYS OUT
FOR A WHILE.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.994
- NICE.

11:42.030 --> 11:43.292
NOW I MAY NEVER
GET A CHANCE

11:43.330 --> 11:45.218
TO HANG
WITH THE KID AGAIN.

11:45.270 --> 11:46.965
- TH ERE--TH ERE ARE
STILL NO LEADS

11:47.000 --> 11:48.490
IN THE ROBBERY
AT THE INDUSTRIAL SIGN FACTORY,

11:48.540 --> 11:50.929
BUT THE OWNER SAYS
NOTHING WAS TAKEN.

11:50.970 --> 11:52.801
- SOUNDS GOOD, O'HARA.
DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

11:52.840 --> 11:53.909
- ALSO,
A TRAPEZE ARTIST DIED

11:53.940 --> 11:55.237
AT THE LE CIRQUE PERFORMANCE
TODAY.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.009
- GREAT.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.472
- CARLTON?

11:58.510 --> 12:02.014
CARLTON,
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

12:02.050 --> 12:03.847
- SORRY, O'HARA, I'M--

12:03.890 --> 12:05.346
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST
TOO FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW

12:05.390 --> 12:08.018
TO CARE ABOUT WHAT LOWLIFE BROKE
INTO WHAT SIGN FACTORY

12:08.060 --> 12:10.381
OR HOW THE ACLU IS GONNA TAKE
ALL THE FUN OUT OF CATCHING HIM.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.228
- WOW, I THOUGHT WITH MARLOWE
FINALLY OUT OF JAIL,

12:13.260 --> 12:15.023
YOU'D BE ON CLOUD NINE.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.823
- YEAH, WELL, THAT ALL
CHANGED ONCE WE DISCOVERED

12:16.870 --> 12:19.395
THAT URSULA GIBBS WAS
GOING TO BE HER PAROLE OFFICER.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.489
- URSULA? THE GIRL
YOU HOOKED UP WITH AFTER THE--

12:21.540 --> 12:23.303
- YEAH.
- LET ME GUESS, YOU NEVER--

12:23.340 --> 12:24.307
- NO.
- DIDN'T I TRY TO WARN YOU

12:24.340 --> 12:25.967
THAT SHE WAS--?
- YEP.

12:26.010 --> 12:27.773
- BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN
BECAUSE YOU KEPT CUTTING ME OFF.

12:27.810 --> 12:29.471
- YEP, AND SO SHE'S
TAKING IT OUT ON MARLOWE.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.899
SO NOT ONLY CAN MARLOWE
NOT LIVE WITH ME

12:31.950 --> 12:34.043
IN THE HOME
THAT I HAVE BUILT FOR US,

12:34.080 --> 12:36.014
BUT HER ONLY AFFORDABLE
HOUSING OPTIONS

12:36.050 --> 12:39.042
ARE NO-I.D.-REQUIRED APARTMENTS
IN ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOODS.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.081
[clicking]

12:41.120 --> 12:42.883
_ UM--

12:42.930 --> 12:44.886
UH--

12:44.930 --> 12:47.057
CARLTON!

12:47.100 --> 12:49.796
I THINK I HAVE A WAY
TO HELP YOU AND MARLOWE.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.958
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.060
- ZOLA, WE'RE--WE'RE
VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS,

12:56.100 --> 12:58.364
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT
FRANCOIS IS--

12:58.410 --> 13:01.834
IS LOOKING DOWN ON YOU
FROM THE BIG TENT IN THE SKY.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.007
OR LOOKING UP AT YOU
FROM THE FIERY--

13:04.050 --> 13:06.109
- WHAT HAPPENED
WAS NO ACCIDENT.

13:06.150 --> 13:09.142
I'VE SEEN HIM PERFORM
THAT TRICK A THOUSAND TIMES.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.909
- WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO IT
FOR YOU, OKAY?

13:10.950 --> 13:12.542
BUT WE--WE NEED TO KNOW

13:12.590 --> 13:15.582
THE GOINGS-ON
BEHIND THE SCENES, ALL RIGHT?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.121
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE--
WE BE IN THE MIX.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.980
- ALL UP IN THE KOOL-AID.

13:19.030 --> 13:20.292
- OUR KIND OF PEOPLE

13:20.330 --> 13:21.991
TRADITIONALLY DON'T
TAKE WELL TO OUTSIDERS.

13:22.030 --> 13:24.169
THEY CAN BE GUARDED.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.327
- LIKE GUS
WITH HIS BELLY BU'I'I'ON.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.861
- IT WOULD BE ESPECIALLY
DIFFICULT NOW.

13:28.900 --> 13:31.334
BECAUSE OF FRANCOIS' DEATH,
EVERYONE IS ON EDGE.

13:31.370 --> 13:32.974
WE'VE EVEN HAD
TWO PERFORMERS QUIT.

13:33.010 --> 13:35.604
WE JUST LOST OUR MASTER
OF CEREMONY AND YODELER.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.971
- YODELER?

13:37.010 --> 13:43.017
[yodeling]

13:55.200 --> 13:57.418
- TERRIBLE,
BUT WE'RE IN A BIND,

13:57.470 --> 13:59.938
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO DO.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.494
YOU'RE ON AT 7:00.
DON'T BE LATE.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.065
- WHAT?
COME ON, SON.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.236
COME ON, SON.
YOU GOT THAT.

14:05.270 --> 14:07.238
GET IT, GET IT.
GET UP IN IT.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.077
DO IT.
GOT IT. WHAT UP?

14:09.110 --> 14:10.543
WOULD YOU GIVE ME THAT?

14:10.580 --> 14:11.945
- I GOT IT, SHAWN.
- YOU'RE GONNA DROP IT.

14:11.980 --> 14:13.311
- I SAID, I GOT IT.

14:13.350 --> 14:15.079
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT MEN WITH LONG ARMS.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.473
- YEAH, THAT EVERYTHING ELSE
IS REALLY, REALLY SHORT.

14:16.520 --> 14:19.045
- WHA--WHAT?
- THAT'S HUGO.

14:19.090 --> 14:20.557
HE'S THE ONE THAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO CATCH FRANCOIS.

14:20.590 --> 14:21.614
[musical ringtone]

14:21.660 --> 14:22.957
- LET'S GO CHAT HIM UP.

14:22.990 --> 14:24.548
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

14:24.590 --> 14:27.388
THIS IS, LIKE, THE FOURTH TIME
JULES HAS CALLED ME.

14:27.430 --> 14:29.990
HI, SWEETIE.
[clears throat]

14:30.030 --> 14:34.160
UH-HUH. UH, I'M KIND OF DOING
MY THING RIGHT NOW, BUT SURE.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.531
WHATEVER YOU THINK,
JULES.

14:35.570 --> 14:38.300
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

14:38.340 --> 14:39.466
MRAH MRAH MRAH.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.000
DUDE, WE GO'I'I'A BE CAREFUL.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.179
ZOLA SAID HUGO'S
NOT A BIG FAN

14:43.210 --> 14:45.178
OF CHARACTER ARTISTS
LIKE US.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.917
YOU LAY BACK.
I GOT THIS.

14:47.950 --> 14:52.512
- GOT IT.

14:52.550 --> 14:55.383
- [laughs]
WHAT'S UP, CIRCULES?

14:55.420 --> 14:58.059
[laughs]

14:58.090 --> 14:59.284
- I DON'T BELIEVE
WE GOT YOUR NAME.

14:59.330 --> 15:00.957
- OH, SORRY.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.925
UH, ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON.
I KNOW, I KNOW.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.063
MY FOLKS WERE BIG FANS
OF HERTZ RENTAL CAR.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.294
[clears throat]

15:08.340 --> 15:09.637
HEARD ABOUT THE ACCIDENT
LAST WEEK, MAN.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.433
THAT'S A BUMMER, HUH?

15:11.470 --> 15:14.075
- I WAS RIGHT THERE. I STILL
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

15:14.110 --> 15:16.601
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN DOING
THAT TRICK FOREVER,

15:16.640 --> 15:18.244
BUT THE OTHER DAY,
HE JUST--

15:18.280 --> 15:20.111
HE DIDN'T EXTEND
ALL THE WAY.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.141
- HMM.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.949
- YOUR PSYCHIC HUNCH
WAS SPOT-ON AGAIN, SHAWN.

15:29.990 --> 15:31.651
THIS MAN WAS DEAD

15:31.690 --> 15:34.022
BEFORE HIS BODY WAS
LAUNCHED INTO THE AIR.

15:34.060 --> 15:36.119
THE BROKEN NECK AND INTERNAL
INJURIES FROM THE FALL

15:36.160 --> 15:37.366
WERE ALL POST-MORTEM.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.594
- SO THEN,
WHAT KILLED HIM?

15:38.630 --> 15:40.131
- ELECT ROCUTION.
- HMM.

15:40.170 --> 15:41.467
- IT WASN'T OBVIOUS
AT FIRST.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.728
WHOEVER COVERED THIS UP

15:42.770 --> 15:44.738
MUST HAVE KEPT THE BODY
ON ICE.

15:44.770 --> 15:46.306
NOW, COME OVER HERE.

15:46.340 --> 15:48.228
COME ON, I WANT
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.145
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GONNA
CATCH NECROPHYLOPIGMENTOSIS.

15:50.180 --> 15:52.239
[laughs]
PROBABLY NOT.

15:59.590 --> 16:02.286
AS ANYONE GOOD AT FOREPLAY
CAN TELL YOU,

16:02.320 --> 16:06.029
ELECTRICITY
ALWAYS LEAVES A MARK.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.756
I KNOW, I KNOW.
T.M.I. TELL MORE INFORMATION.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.519
YOU SEE, A FLASHLIGHT BA'I'I'ERY
AND A PAPER CLIP--

16:11.570 --> 16:13.538
- UH, NO NEED
TO EXPLAIN, WOODY.

16:13.570 --> 16:15.993
- I GO'I'I'A TELL YOU,
I SOMETIMES HAVE TROUBLE

16:16.040 --> 16:19.032
READING SOCIAL CUES,
ESPECIALLY CROSS-CULTURALLY.

16:19.070 --> 16:20.332
- WHAT?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.029
- YEAH, IT'S REALLY
STARTING TO HURT ME

16:22.080 --> 16:23.479
IN THE DATING DEPARTMENT.

16:23.510 --> 16:26.001
I CAN'T--I CAN'T READ
ALIVE WOMEN ANYMORE.

16:26.050 --> 16:29.508
IT'S LIKE,
YOU'RE STROBING RIGHT NOW.

16:29.550 --> 16:31.609
- I'M GOING TO OPEN AN OFFICIAL
MURDER INVESTIGATION

16:31.650 --> 16:33.083
BASED ON THIS NEW EVIDENCE.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.451
- RIGHT.
- MM-HMM.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.378
- KEEP IT LOOSE.

16:36.420 --> 16:38.752
- UM, SHAWN,
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY

16:38.790 --> 16:40.553
WITH WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT
EARLIER ON THE PHONE?

16:40.600 --> 16:44.058
- YEAH, YEAH.
I'M TOTALLY COOL WITH THAT.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.362
- THANK YOU.
- MM.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.095
MRAH.
- MRAH.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.664
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.635
- UH, JULIET, UH,
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW

16:51.670 --> 16:55.379
ANY SINGLE FEMALES THAT ARE
CURRENTLY LIVING, WOULD YOU?

16:55.410 --> 16:57.241
- YOU KNOW WHAT, WOODY?

16:57.280 --> 17:01.569
I AM GOING TO GIVE THAT
SOME SERIOUS THOUGHT.

17:02.780 --> 17:05.783
- JULES, I'M HOME.
[sighs]

17:05.820 --> 17:07.287
- OH, HEY, SPENCER.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

17:07.320 --> 17:08.617
I JUST WHIPPED
SOMETHING TOGETHER

17:08.660 --> 17:09.752
WITH WHAT YOU GUYS HAD
IN THE FRIDGE.

17:09.790 --> 17:13.556
[shaker squeaks]

17:15.260 --> 17:19.367
- SOME BREAD FOR YOU,
MY DEAR?

17:19.400 --> 17:23.461
- HELLO, SHAWN.
- HI.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.068
- WELL, IF YOU WANT
SOME PASTA, JUST ASK.

17:25.110 --> 17:26.361
THERE'S PLENTY.

17:26.410 --> 17:29.800
- OMG, WTF, AND JTI'.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.740
- JONATHAN TAYLOR THOMAS
IS NOT AN ACRONYM, SHAWN.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.145
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

17:33.180 --> 17:34.647
- SHAWN, YOU SAID
YOU WERE COOL WITH THIS.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.272
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT
ON THE PHONE.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.083
THAT MARLOWE COULD STAY HERE
WHILE SHE AND CARLTON

17:38.120 --> 17:39.417
WORKED OUT
HER PAROLE SITUATION.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.156
- RIGHT, THE THING
WE TALKED ABOUT ON THE PHONE

17:41.190 --> 17:41.758
THAT I SAID
I WAS COOL WITH.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.280
RIGHT.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.627
THEN I SAID I WAS
COOL WITH IT AGAIN

17:44.660 --> 17:45.854
WHEN WE WERE AT WOODY'S.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.448
ALL RIGHT, FINE,
BUT IT BE'I'I'ER BE TEMPORARY,

17:47.500 --> 17:50.594
AND THEN IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME.

17:50.630 --> 17:53.133
- OF COURSE.

17:53.170 --> 17:54.865
- OH, HEY, I TOOK
A QUICK SHOWER AFI'ER WORK,

17:54.900 --> 17:56.458
AND I PUT YOUR ROBE
BACK ON THE HOOK.

17:56.500 --> 18:00.129
- IT'S YOURS. SO IS THE HOOK.
SO IS THE DOOR.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.308
I HAVE TO GO...ANYWHERE.

18:10.150 --> 18:11.788
NO, I AM NOT OKAY

18:11.820 --> 18:14.482
WITH LASSITER AND MARLOWE
BEING ALL UP IN OUR SPACE.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.112
WE JUST MOVED IN TOGETHER.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.185
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW INTRUSIVE THAT IS?

18:18.230 --> 18:20.448
- I CALLED TO SPEAK TO GUS.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.821
- I'M SORRY, RACHAEL.
THAT'S MY BAD.

18:22.860 --> 18:24.623
- THANKS FOR PICKING MAX UP
FROM SOCCER PRACTICE.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.365
I'LL BE LEAVING WORK
IN AN HOUR.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.164
AND DO ME A FAVOR, KEEP MAX
AWAY FROM DEAD PEOPLE, OKAY?

18:29.200 --> 18:31.168
- [laughs]
- SEE YOU.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.529
- [mimics Rachael]
DO ME A FAVOR

18:32.570 --> 18:34.299
AND KEEP MAX AWAY
FROM DEAD PEOPLE, OKAY?

18:34.340 --> 18:35.830
[laughs]

18:35.880 --> 18:38.849
- STILL HERE, SHAWN.
AND I'M NOT A LEPRECHAUN.

18:38.880 --> 18:41.474
- OF COURSE NOT.
[phone beeps]

18:41.520 --> 18:44.512
MAX! HEY, LI'ITLE MAN,
GET IN THE CAR.

18:44.550 --> 18:45.642
- BYE.

18:45.690 --> 18:48.158
- IS THAT YOUR AUDITION
FOR TO CATCH A PREDATOR?

18:48.190 --> 18:49.851
- SUCK IT, SHAWN.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.848
- HEY, BIG BOY.
- OH, JEEZ.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.551
- BUCKLE IN.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.852
- LOOK, MAN. YOU HAVE
TO STOP IT. TRUST ME.

18:56.900 --> 18:59.562
AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHO STUFFED FRANCOIS' DEAD BODY

18:59.600 --> 19:01.431
INTO THAT CAPSULE
BEFORE THE SHOW STARTED.

19:01.470 --> 19:05.531
- UH, SHAWN, LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT THE D-E-C-E-A-S-E-D

19:05.570 --> 19:06.901
IN FRONT OF YOU-KNOW-WHO.

19:06.940 --> 19:08.601
- WHY ARE YOU SPELLING?

19:08.640 --> 19:10.198
- BECAUSE WE DON'T
WANT TO EXPOSE--

19:10.250 --> 19:15.847
TO ANYTHING
I-N-A-P-P-R-O-P-R-I-A-T-E

19:15.880 --> 19:18.519
A-B-O-U-T--
- HOLD IT, MAN.

19:18.550 --> 19:19.881
YOU DON'T NEED TO GET
SOME PEN AND A PAPER?

19:19.920 --> 19:21.683
- "INAPPROPRIATE"?

19:21.720 --> 19:25.429
- AH, FINE. NO MORE TALKING
ABOUT THE CASE.

19:25.460 --> 19:26.859
THAT'S PRODUCT IVE.

19:26.890 --> 19:28.255
- THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IT
ON THE NEWS.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.528
THEY SHOWED
THE DEAD GUY THAT DIED

19:29.560 --> 19:30.891
THAT I SAW BACKSTAGE,
FOR REAL.

19:30.930 --> 19:33.364
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU SAW FRANCOIS BACKSTAGE?

19:33.400 --> 19:34.958
- WHILE I WAS LOOKING
FOR THE BATHROOM,

19:35.000 --> 19:36.865
TWO PEOPLE WERE PUTTING
MAKEUP ON HIS FACE.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.731
- DUDE, THAT'S IT.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.431
IF WE FIND THOSE TWO GUYS,
WE'VE GOT OUR KILLERS

19:40.480 --> 19:42.300
BECAUSE THEY WERE PUTTING
MAKEUP ON A DEAD MAN.

19:42.340 --> 19:43.898
MAX, YOU THINK
YOU'D RECOGNIZE THEM

19:43.950 --> 19:44.905
IF WE TOOK YOU BACK
TO THE CIRCUS?

19:44.950 --> 19:49.273
- UH, NO, NO, NO, SHAWN.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.981
- PLEASE, GUS, PLEASE?

19:51.020 --> 19:52.578
- [laughs]

19:52.620 --> 19:54.588
HOW ABOUT HER?

19:54.620 --> 19:58.226
ONE OF THESE TWO?
- MM, NO.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.989
- [laughs]
WAIT.

20:00.030 --> 20:02.999
- YES, I WILL MAKE SURE THAT
MAX GETS HIS HOMEWORK DONE.

20:03.030 --> 20:04.793
IN FACT, SHAWN
IS HELPING HIM

20:04.830 --> 20:06.764
WITH SOME MULTIPLE CHOICE
PROBLEMS AS WE SPEAK.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.267
- WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY?
- MM-MM.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.733
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
GUY WITH THE BIKE?

20:09.770 --> 20:10.759
- MM-MM.
- YOU SURE?

20:10.810 --> 20:11.799
- MM-HMM.
- BYE, BOO.

20:14.340 --> 20:15.773
- HIM?
- MM-MM.

20:15.810 --> 20:17.641
- UH, WE NEED TO GET GOING.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.874
RACHAEL'S GONNA START
GETTING WORRIED.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.616
- JUST GIVE THE KID
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

20:20.650 --> 20:23.710
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.308
I DECIDE
WHEN WE TAKE HIM HOME.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.888
- I WANT TO STAY WITH SHAWN,
BUT YOU CAN GO.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.356
- ZOLA?

20:32.390 --> 20:33.596
HUH.

20:33.630 --> 20:36.258
- EW.
- THAT'S INTERESTING.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.562
LOOKS LIKE SHE LEI-T
IN A HURRY,

20:37.600 --> 20:39.295
OR SHE'S JUST
A FILTHY PIG.

20:39.330 --> 20:40.831
- MAX, DO YOU REMEMBER AT ALL
WHAT THESE GUYS LOOK LIKE?

20:40.870 --> 20:42.030
- NO, I DON'T.

20:42.070 --> 20:43.537
THEY WERE
WEARING MAKEUP TOO.

20:43.570 --> 20:44.639
- MAX.
- DID YOU HEAR THAT, SHAWN?

20:44.670 --> 20:45.830
THEY WERE ALL
WEARING MAKEUP,

20:45.870 --> 20:47.872
SO HE WON'T BE ABLE
TO I.D. THEM.

20:47.910 --> 20:50.378
NOW, LET'S GO.
- NO, WE'RE TOGETHER ON THIS.

20:50.410 --> 20:51.877
THIS IS TAKING TOO LONG.
I CANNOT WAIT.

20:51.910 --> 20:53.775
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG, LITTLE MAN?

20:53.820 --> 20:55.640
- THAT'S THE VOICE OF THE MAN
I HEARD PUTTING ON THE MAKEUP.

20:55.680 --> 21:00.356
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

21:00.390 --> 21:01.652
- CAN WE JUST GET THIS DONE?

21:01.690 --> 21:03.681
MONDAY, WE'RE OUT.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.722
- THEY WERE IN THE LUNCHROOM.
THEY'RE NON-SPEAKERS.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.292
GUS, THOSE COULD BE OUR GUYS.
WE NEED TO FOLLOW THEM.

21:12.330 --> 21:13.365
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, SHAWN.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.867
- COOL.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.903
- SHAWN, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A--WAIT!

21:21.840 --> 21:22.807
-AH!

21:22.840 --> 21:24.979
OH, HI.

21:25.010 --> 21:29.014
- O'HARA. ANY--
ANY NEWS FROM THE OFFICE?

21:29.050 --> 21:32.918
- UM, UM, UH, WELL, UH,

21:32.950 --> 21:36.716
WE DID BRING SOMEONE IN
FOR QUESTIONING

21:36.760 --> 21:40.082
ON THAT SIGN FACTORY CASE,
AND, UH,

21:40.130 --> 21:41.927
WE'VE NARROWED DOWN
THE ELECT ROCUTION

21:41.960 --> 21:43.621
IN THE LE CIRQUE THING.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.525
UM, HAVE THESE, UH, LIGHTS
BEEN ON ALL DAY?

21:46.570 --> 21:49.835
OH, MY GOD. THE VASE
IS NOT AN ASHTRAY!

21:49.870 --> 21:52.509
CARLTON,
MAY I HAVE A WORD?

21:52.540 --> 21:55.031
- SURE. CERTAIN LY.

21:56.640 --> 21:57.971
- I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE.

22:01.020 --> 22:04.945
THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
A GOOD IDEA.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.946
- OKAY, LOOK, I-I KNOW
IT'S A BIT OF AN INCONVENIENCE,

22:06.990 --> 22:08.389
BUT, YOU KNOW,
MY HANDS ARE TIED.

22:08.420 --> 22:09.910
URSULA IS MAKING IT
DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE

22:09.960 --> 22:11.780
FOR US TO SPEND
ANY TIME TOGETHER.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.821
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION,
I REALLY DO.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.088
- YEAH, AND I PROMISE
TO REIMBURSE YOU

22:15.130 --> 22:16.722
FOR ANY INCIDENTALS,

22:16.760 --> 22:18.796
PROVIDED YOU HAVE
THE ORIGINAL RECEIPT.

22:18.830 --> 22:21.833
- I STILL JUST--
I HAVE TO ASK, UM,

22:21.870 --> 22:26.637
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE NEEDING
THIS ARRANGEMENT?

22:26.670 --> 22:29.104
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

22:29.140 --> 22:32.906
I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING ELSE OUT.

22:32.950 --> 22:35.009
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.555
- THAT'S THEM.
TURN LEI-T.

22:43.590 --> 22:44.921
THEY'RE HEADING TOWARDS
THAT INDUSTRIAL PARK.

22:47.130 --> 22:48.757
- YOU KNOW I HAVE
TO GET MAX HOME.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.028
RACHAEL'S GIVEN ME
ANOTHER CHANCE WITH HIM.

22:50.060 --> 22:52.927
I CAN'T BLOW IT.

22:52.970 --> 22:56.690
- DUDE.

22:56.740 --> 22:59.163
- OH, MY GOSH.

22:59.210 --> 23:00.700
- COOL.

23:00.740 --> 23:02.833
- NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE
CAN DO THAT.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.043
- WHERE THE HECK
IS HE GOING?

23:10.890 --> 23:13.882
- HMM.

23:13.920 --> 23:17.856
- [grunts]

23:17.890 --> 23:20.859
- ELECTRICITY
ALWAYS LEAVES A MARK.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.993
- THEY'RE A BUNCH OF THIEVES.

23:23.030 --> 23:25.419
FRANCOIS
WAS THE FOURTH MEMBER.

23:25.470 --> 23:26.926
WHATEVER'S IN THERE,
HE DIED TRYING TO GET IT,

23:26.970 --> 23:28.699
AND THE OTHER THREE
COVERED UP HIS DEATH

23:28.740 --> 23:30.833
BY MAKING IT LOOK
LIKE AN ACCIDENT IN THE SHOW.

23:30.870 --> 23:32.599
YEAH, WE NEED
TO FOLLOW THEM INSIDE.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.005
- YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.429
I'M NOT TAKING MAX INSIDE
A POSSIBLE CRIME SCENE.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.879
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE.
- ALL RIGHT.

23:37.910 --> 23:39.138
LET'S BE RESPONSIBLE.

23:39.180 --> 23:40.818
LEAVE HIM OUT HERE IN THE CAR,
BY HIMSELF,

23:40.850 --> 23:45.549
LIKE A SHIH-TZU.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.455
- MAX, WAIT!

23:47.490 --> 23:51.859
- OH. OH, THAT FEELS SO GOOD.
- [laughs]

23:51.890 --> 23:53.528
OKAY, BEFORE YOU SAY
ANYTHING,

23:53.560 --> 23:54.788
WE HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

23:54.830 --> 23:57.822
WE ARE GONNA BEAT URSULA
AT HER OWN GAME.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.758
THE PAROLE GUIDELINES
SAY THAT THE PAROLEE

23:59.800 --> 24:01.688
MUST BE ALLOWED TO LIVE
WITH HER LAWFUL SPOUSE,

24:01.740 --> 24:04.868
SO...DO YOU WANT
TO TELL HER?

24:04.910 --> 24:06.969
both:
WE GOT ENGAGED!

24:11.210 --> 24:14.919
- WHERE'D THE CIRCUS GUYS GO?
- SHH!

24:14.950 --> 24:18.681
- WHAT IS IN HERE THAT IS
SO DAMN VALUABLE?

24:18.720 --> 24:20.859
[alarm]

24:20.890 --> 24:23.085
WHOA!
ALL RIGHT.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.918
- UH, SHAWN, WE NEED
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.019
[sirens]

24:28.060 --> 24:32.019
- THIS IS THE S.B.P.D.
STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

24:32.070 --> 24:35.164
[cell phone rings]
DO NOT MOVE.

24:35.200 --> 24:38.499
- HOW DOES SHE ALWAYS PICK
THE WRONG TIME TO CALL?

24:38.540 --> 24:40.235
[indistinct shouting]
HEY, BOO.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.745
- HE WAS INVOLVED IN A BREAK-IN?
HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN?

24:46.780 --> 24:49.044
- SEE, I KNOW YOU'RE
DISAPPOINTED, BUT I CAN EXPLAIN.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.945
- "DISAPPOINTED" DOESN'T EVEN
BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HOW I FEEL.

24:50.990 --> 24:51.945
WHAT SORT OF FUTURE
IS MAX GONNA HAVE

24:51.990 --> 24:53.981
WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD?

24:54.020 --> 24:56.511
- A LEGITIMATE SHOT AT PLAYING
PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL SOMEDAY?

24:56.560 --> 24:59.984
- NO.
- THEN BLEAK.

25:00.030 --> 25:03.591
- RACHAEL, WAIT.

25:03.630 --> 25:05.120
- JULES,
QUESTION OF THE DAY.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.889
WHY WOULD THESE DUDES
BREAK INTO A LABORATORY

25:07.940 --> 25:08.964
A FEW DAYS AGO,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.865
SEE ONE
OF THEIR CREW MEMBERS DIE,

25:10.910 --> 25:12.832
AND THEN RISK BREAKING
INTO THE SAME EXACT LABORATORY,

25:12.870 --> 25:15.668
ALL FOR SOME WORTHLESS
LABORATORY SUPPLIES?

25:15.710 --> 25:17.075
- NOT SO FAST.

25:17.110 --> 25:18.998
THE BUILDING MANAGER SAID
THERE WAS A BREAK-IN,

25:19.050 --> 25:20.813
AND 10 GRAMS OF A SUBSTANCE
CALLED "TRITIUM" WAS STOLEN.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.579
- JULES,
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

25:22.620 --> 25:24.178
NO ONE'S GONNA RISK THEIR LIVES
FOR THAT MUCH CHEWING GUM.

25:24.220 --> 25:26.814
- "TRITIUM IS
A SELF-ILLUMINATING,

25:26.850 --> 25:30.115
"MANMADE ISOTOPE USED IN THINGS
LIKE WATCH FACES AND KEY CHAINS.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.980
"IT'S HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER.

25:32.030 --> 25:35.193
JUST 10 GRAMS OF IT HAS
A STREET VALUE OF 300 GRAND."

25:39.270 --> 25:43.058
- WHOA.
LIKE AN EXIT SIGN.

25:43.100 --> 25:44.601
OR AN INDUSTRIAL SIGN.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.039
- THE BREAK-IN
AT THE SIGN FACTORY.

25:46.070 --> 25:47.833
I BET IT WAS
THE SAME CREW.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.677
- THEY WERE LOOKING FOR TRITIUM,
BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANY

25:49.710 --> 25:51.348
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY MADE
IN A LABORATORY.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.940
- STOP SAYING IT LIKE THAT.
- SAYING WHAT LIKE WHAT?

25:53.980 --> 25:56.778
- TODAY WAS THEM GOING BACK
TO DO THE JOB RIGHT.

25:56.820 --> 25:58.685
I'LL PUT OUT AN APB
ON THE CIRCUS CRIMINALS

25:58.720 --> 26:00.711
WITH INSTRUCTIONS
TO CHECK ALL THE PLACES

26:00.760 --> 26:02.250
THEY COULD SAFELY STORE
THE UNSTABLE TRITIUM.

26:02.290 --> 26:04.929
- WELL DONE!

26:22.980 --> 26:25.744
DUDE, I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD HUNCH
OF WHERE OUR GUYS ARE GOING,

26:25.780 --> 26:27.372
AND I THINK ZOLA'S INVOLVED.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

26:27.410 --> 26:28.968
- RACHAEL JUST BROKE UP
WITH ME.

26:29.020 --> 26:31.818
- WHAT? OH, THAT IS
JUST AWFUL, GUSTER.

26:31.850 --> 26:33.852
I AM SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

26:33.890 --> 26:35.949
HEY, EVERYBODY,
I JUST GOT ENGAGED!

26:35.990 --> 26:38.879
- LASSIE, THAT'S GREAT!
- [laughs]

26:38.930 --> 26:40.955
- I MEAN--I MEAN,
THAT'S--IT'S ALL RIGHT.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.820
LOOK, BUDDY,
COME WITH ME.

26:42.860 --> 26:43.963
YOU'LL GET YOUR MIND
OFF THINGS.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.365
- THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.288
THIS WHOLE TIME,
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU

26:47.330 --> 26:49.036
THAT YOU'VE BEEN GOING TOO FAR,
BUT NO, YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN.

26:49.070 --> 26:51.106
NOW IT'S TOO LATE.
- NO, IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

26:51.140 --> 26:52.835
LOOK, RACHAEL'S
GONNA CALM DOWN,

26:52.870 --> 26:54.838
AND IT'S GONNA BE FINE,
BUT IN THE MEANTIME--

26:54.880 --> 26:56.768
- IN THE MEANTIME, YOU'LL GO
ABOUT LIKE EVERYTHING'S FINE,

26:56.810 --> 26:58.846
AND I'LL BE LEI-T TO CLEAN UP
THE MESS THAT YOU'VE CAUSED.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.108
I'M TIRED OF YOUR MOUTH
WRITING CHECKS

27:00.150 --> 27:03.039
THAT MY ASS HAS TO CASH!

27:03.080 --> 27:05.287
- GUS, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO LOWER THE VOLUME

27:05.320 --> 27:07.288
OR, AT THE VERY LEAST,
CHANGE THAT METAPHOR.

27:07.320 --> 27:10.721
- SHAWN,
I REALLY LIKE RACHAEL,

27:10.760 --> 27:13.285
AND BECAUSE OF YOU,
I MAY HAVE LOST HER.

27:13.330 --> 27:17.289
- ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY.
OKAY?

27:17.330 --> 27:20.026
I'M SORRY. WHAT--
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

27:20.070 --> 27:23.130
- I CAN'T DO THIS
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

27:23.170 --> 27:26.162
I NEED TIME ALONE.

27:29.140 --> 27:31.142
_ RAWRI
[glgglesj

27:31.180 --> 27:34.047
- CARLTON, DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO LOOK AT THAT FILE?

27:34.080 --> 27:38.744
- YEAH, RIGHT HERE.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.189
- THESE ARE CHINA SETTINGS.

27:40.220 --> 27:41.915
- YEAH. WHICH GOES BEST
WITH MY SILVERWARE?

27:41.960 --> 27:43.757
OH, YOU MEANT THE FILE
YOU FAXED OVER.

27:43.790 --> 27:45.052
[laughs]
I'M SORRY.

27:45.090 --> 27:46.284
WE'RE STILL CELEBRATING.

27:46.330 --> 27:48.059
YEAH, I GOT IT RIGHT HERE.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.193
SO THE SIGN FACTORY CASE

27:50.230 --> 27:52.323
AND THE CIRQUE MURDER
ARE NOW ONE AND THE SAME?

27:52.370 --> 27:56.761
- YEAH, AND--
[knocks on door]

27:56.800 --> 27:59.064
- THE WEDDING PLANNER'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE UNTIL 6:00.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.806
- I KNOW.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.944
- HELLO.
- HELLO.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.904
I'M HERE FOR A SURPRISE CHECK-IN
ON MY PAROLEE.

28:06.950 --> 28:08.076
- [laughs]
OKAY.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.009
MARLOWE,
YOUR PAROLE OFFICER'S HERE.

28:11.050 --> 28:14.087
- I HEAR
THAT THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE

28:14.120 --> 28:16.384
IN MS. VICCELLIO'S
RELATIONSHIP STATUS.

28:16.420 --> 28:19.821
- YES, MS. VICCELLIO AND I
ARE NOW ENGAGED,

28:19.860 --> 28:23.796
SO I'M AFRAID THAT MAY ALTER
SOME OF YOUR RESTRICTIONS.

28:23.830 --> 28:26.822
- I SEE. I UNDERSTAND
THIS JUST HAPPENED?

28:26.870 --> 28:28.098
- YES, I WOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU MYSELF,

28:28.140 --> 28:29.937
BUT I COULDN'T FIND
YOUR NUMBER.

28:29.970 --> 28:31.835
- HONEY.

28:31.870 --> 28:33.974
- WELL, I'M SURE
YOUR CELEBRATION

28:34.010 --> 28:35.898
HASN'T INVOLVED
ANY ALCOHOL

28:35.940 --> 28:41.913
BECAUSE, AS WE ALL KNOW, THAT'S
A VIOLATION OF YOUR PAROLE.

28:41.950 --> 28:46.944
UH-HUH.
I SUSPECTED AS MUCH.

28:46.990 --> 28:51.051
I'M SURE THAT YOU KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH THIS.

28:51.090 --> 28:56.926
URINE SAMPLE, NOW.
- [sighs]

28:56.960 --> 28:59.292
- I WONDER IF YOU WILL BE
WEARING WHITE

28:59.330 --> 29:02.993
OR PRISON ORANGE
AT YOUR WEDDING?

29:03.040 --> 29:05.065
I'LL WAIT RIGHT THERE
TO FIND OUT.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.185
- O'HARA, MAY I HAVE
A QUICK WORD WITH YOU, PLEASE?

29:19.220 --> 29:21.950
- MM-HMM.

29:21.990 --> 29:23.355
- I NEED YOU
TO DO A FAVOR.

29:23.390 --> 29:24.948
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S NOTHING WEIRD.

29:24.990 --> 29:27.356
JUST--I NEED YOU TO TAKE
THIS VASE AND GO PEE IN IT.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.948
- NO.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.969
- IF MARLOWE TESTS POSITIVE
FOR ALCOHOL,

29:32.000 --> 29:34.798
THEN THE SYSTEM
HAS BEATEN US, O'HARA.

29:34.840 --> 29:35.966
IT'S BEATEN LOVE.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.036
NOW, JUST TAKE THIS
IN THE BATHROOM

29:38.070 --> 29:39.037
AND DO ME A SOLID.

29:39.070 --> 29:40.162
POOR CHOICE OF WORDS.

29:40.210 --> 29:45.045
JUST, PLEASE,
I AM DESPERATE.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.446
- OKAY, I THINK I HAVE
A WAY TO HELP.

29:47.480 --> 29:55.387
- GREAT.

29:55.420 --> 29:58.287
IT'S YOU! YOU!
YOU LET IT HAPPEN!

29:58.330 --> 30:01.549
YOU, GUS! YOU LET IT
HAPPEN TO YOURSELF!

30:01.600 --> 30:04.967
YOU LET IT HAPPEN TO YOUR--
- GUS?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.922
I WAS JUST HEADING OVER
TO THE PSYCH OFFICE

30:06.970 --> 30:08.460
TO SEE IF SHAWN
WANTED TO GRAB SOME LUNCH.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.036
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS,
AND I DON'T CARE.

30:10.070 --> 30:11.867
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.263
- HOLD ON, HOLD ON. YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

30:13.310 --> 30:15.039
- OH, LET ME GUESS.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.877
SHAWN TOLD YOU HE WAS GONNA
TRY TO HELP YOU OUT,

30:16.910 --> 30:18.502
AND AS IT TURNS OUT, HE'S REALLY
JUST TOO FOCUSED ON HIMSELF,

30:18.550 --> 30:20.040
AND HE ENDED UP
RUINING THINGS.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.377
- WOW, THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.978
- [laughs]
NOT REALLY.

30:23.020 --> 30:24.282
WHILE YOU WERE
PACING AROUND,

30:24.320 --> 30:25.912
I WAS SITTING ON A PARK BENCH
OVER THERE,

30:25.950 --> 30:26.985
LISTENING TO YOU BLABBER
TO YOURSELF.

30:27.020 --> 30:28.351
- IT'S NOT LIKE SHAWN

30:28.390 --> 30:29.914
HASN'T MESSED UP
MY RELATIONSHIPS BEFORE,

30:29.960 --> 30:31.279
BUT RACHAEL IS DIFFERENT.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.218
I REALLY CARE ABOUT HER,
AND SHAWN DOESN'T CARE

30:33.260 --> 30:35.524
BECAUSE HE'S TOO CAUGHT UP
IN HIS OWN SELF-INTERESTS.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.289
- GUS, YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU
GUYS WERE GROWING UP,

30:37.330 --> 30:39.389
AND SHAWN STOLE THAT CAR
TO IMPRESS THE GIRL?

30:39.430 --> 30:41.193
I DISCOVERED THAT HE STOLE IT
ON OCTOBER 15TH.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.992
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DAY IS?

30:43.040 --> 30:45.167
- OF COURSE I DO.
IT'S TITO JACKSON'S BIRTHDAY.

30:45.210 --> 30:46.632
- IT'S THE DAY
HIS MOTHER MOVED OUT.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.570
- WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

30:48.610 --> 30:50.202
- IN ALL THOSE YEARS,

30:50.240 --> 30:52.947
THE ONE CONSTANT
IN SHAWN'S LIFE HAS BEEN YOU.

30:52.980 --> 30:54.015
NOW, HERE YOU ARE.

30:54.050 --> 30:55.176
YOU'VE MET THIS GREAT GIRL,

30:55.220 --> 30:56.448
AND HE'S FACING
HIS WORST FEAR.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.587
AND WHAT YOU SEE
AS BEING PURELY SELFISH

31:00.620 --> 31:02.349
MIGHT JUST BE HIM

31:02.390 --> 31:03.948
AFRAID THAT HE MIGHT
LOSE SOMETHING ELSE

31:03.990 --> 31:06.458
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO HIM.

31:06.490 --> 31:09.027
- [sighs]

31:09.060 --> 31:10.618
- HI, URSULA.

31:10.660 --> 31:13.128
DO YOU MIND IF I SIT DOWN
FOR A MOMENT?

31:13.170 --> 31:15.058
- OF COURSE, DETECTIVE.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.294
LET ME GUESS.

31:16.340 --> 31:19.969
YOU WOULD LIKE
TO CONVINCE ME

31:20.010 --> 31:22.035
TO GIVE CARLTON A BREAK.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.469
- WHAT?
NO WAY.

31:24.510 --> 31:27.047
BASED ON WHAT HE DID TO YOU,
I'D SAY HE HAD IT COMING.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.071
- RIGHT.
- [laughs]

31:29.120 --> 31:32.317
YOU KNOW, I AM JUST SITTING
HERE, LOOKING AT YOUR STYLE,

31:32.350 --> 31:35.956
AND I AM WONDERING
WHY A HOTTIE LIKE YOURSELF

31:35.990 --> 31:38.584
IS STILL EVEN GIVING HIM
A MOMENT OF THOUGHT.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.518
- I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
- HMM?

31:40.560 --> 31:43.449
- BECAUSE HE'S A GOD
AMONGST LOVERS.

31:43.500 --> 31:44.922
- WHOA. HOLD ON.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.961
- THE MAN KNOWS HIS WAY
AROUND THE FEMALE FORM

31:47.000 --> 31:49.059
LIKE NONE OTHER.

31:49.100 --> 31:50.931
- URSULA, YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY
PREFER IF YOU DIDN'T--

31:50.970 --> 31:52.062
- AND IT'S NOT JUST
THE PASSION.

31:52.110 --> 31:53.407
IT'S THE STAMINA.
- [groans]

31:53.440 --> 31:54.634
- AND IMAGINATION.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.102
- I AM BEGGING YOU
TO SHARE LESS.

31:56.140 --> 31:59.143
- AND THEN HE NEVER
CALLED ME BACK.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.045
- BASTARD.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.945
- GETTING THAT NIGHT,

32:02.980 --> 32:06.643
THAT ONE COSMICALLY SATISFYING
NIGHT OUT OF MY MIND

32:06.690 --> 32:09.113
JUST DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.980
- HMM.
[phone rings]

32:11.030 --> 32:13.521
- WHICH DOESN'T BODE SO WELL
FOR YOUR PARTNER.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.050
- YOU KNOW,
I NEED TO TAKE THIS CALL.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.024
- MM-HMM.
- REALLY QUICK, FROM THE MORGUE.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.061
HI, WOODY.

32:24.410 --> 32:27.004
- GUS, THIS IS
MY TENTH MESSAGE.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.531
THAT'S MORE THAN MIKEY LEI-T
FOR NICKY IN SWINGERS.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.707
LOOK, I TRACKED THEM HERE.
THEIR CAR IS OUTSIDE.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.945
JUST CALL ME BACK.

32:37.050 --> 32:39.541
OH, HEY, UH,
PUT THAT DOWN!

32:39.590 --> 32:41.319
ACTUALLY, DON'T.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.658
KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
BUT DO IT VERY GENTLY.

32:43.690 --> 32:46.329
YOU PROBABLY
DON'T WANT TO DROP THAT.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.448
- [exhales]

32:50.500 --> 32:51.762
- YOU GUYS ARE JUST
A BUNCH OF THIEVES,

32:51.800 --> 32:55.566
THIEVES GIVING
TOOTHLESS CARNIES A BAD NAME.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.103
- HEAR US OUT.
- YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.

32:58.140 --> 33:01.530
- THE THREE OF US
AND FRANCOIS

33:01.580 --> 33:03.036
WERE DESPERATE FOR WORK,

33:03.080 --> 33:04.399
SO WE LIED ABOUT HAVING
IMMIGRATION PAPERS,

33:04.450 --> 33:05.599
AND WE JOINED LE CIRQUE.

33:05.650 --> 33:06.742
- WE NEEDED
TO GET VISAS FAST,

33:06.780 --> 33:08.077
AND THEN THIS BUSINESSMAN
CAME TO US

33:08.120 --> 33:11.112
AND SAID HE COULD HELP.

33:11.150 --> 33:12.686
- JEFFREY DUKE.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.257
- HE SAID WE HAD A SPECIAL
SKILL SET HE NEEDED,

33:15.290 --> 33:19.329
AND HE PROMISED US VISAS
IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME FAVORS.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.061
- LIKE BREAKING
INTO THE SIGN FACTORY

33:25.100 --> 33:28.297
OR THE EXCELLARATOR LAB
TO FIND THIS TRITIUM,

33:28.340 --> 33:30.467
ONLY THE SECOND ONE DIDN'T GO
QUITE AS PLANNED, DID IT?

33:30.500 --> 33:32.536
REST IN PEACE, FRANCOIS.

33:32.570 --> 33:34.231
- I KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING
WAS ILLEGAL,

33:34.280 --> 33:37.135
BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE
MANY OPTIONS, MATE.

33:43.150 --> 33:45.539
- OF COURSE,
THEY'VE GOT ZOLA.

33:45.590 --> 33:48.286
- HE SAYS IF WE GIVE HIM
THE TRITIUM, HE'LL RELEASE HER,

33:48.320 --> 33:51.187
BUT IF WE FAIL OR IF WE
TRY TO INVOLVE THE POLICE,

33:51.230 --> 33:52.720
HE'LL KILL HER.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.749
WE'RE HEADED OVER
TO HIS WAREHOUSE

33:55.800 --> 33:57.051
IN ONE HOUR TO MEET HIM.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.624
- THAT IS A HORRIBLE IDEA.

33:58.670 --> 34:01.059
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU RECKON
WE DO, MATE?

34:01.100 --> 34:04.103
- I RECKON
WE BREAK HER OUT.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.306
- YOUR BOYFRIEND'S LATE.
I DON'T LIKE WAITING.

34:12.350 --> 34:18.311
- [whistling]

34:18.350 --> 34:20.682
OH, HELLO.
DON'T BE MINDING ME.

34:20.720 --> 34:23.109
I'M FROM
THE COUNTY PEST CONTROL.

34:23.160 --> 34:24.821
- ACT CASUAL.

34:24.860 --> 34:29.092
- SOME MALAYSIAN WEEVILS BEEN
COMING OVER ON THE BOATS,

34:29.130 --> 34:31.325
EATING UP
ALL OF THE LOCAL WEEVILS,

34:31.370 --> 34:34.464
SO COUNTY HAS US SPRAYING
ALL THE WAREHOUSES

34:34.500 --> 34:37.230
DOWN HERE BY THE DOCKS.

34:37.270 --> 34:38.862
NOT TAKING LONG AT ALL.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.231
BUT HERE IS ONE QUESTION
FOR YOU.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.669
HAVE YOU SEEN WEEVILS

34:43.710 --> 34:47.544
IN ANY
OF THESE SMALL POOP HOUSES?

34:47.580 --> 34:49.878
- NO!
NOW, GET OUT OF HERE.

34:49.920 --> 34:53.344
- BEST BE CHECKING ONE
JUST TO BE SURE.

35:02.930 --> 35:04.192
[chuckles]

35:04.230 --> 35:07.620
- [exhales]

35:10.270 --> 35:12.238
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

35:12.270 --> 35:15.273
- OH, MY.
THERE IS MUCH TROUBLE IN HERE.

35:15.310 --> 35:19.178
WEEVILS MAKING LOVE
IN THE SINK COMPARTMENT.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.444
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

35:24.490 --> 35:27.914
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY.

35:27.950 --> 35:30.487
BIGGEST PROBLEM,
I MUST STAY HERE

35:30.520 --> 35:34.490
UNTIL ALL THE WEEVILS
ARE MOSTLY MADE DEAD.

35:34.530 --> 35:36.555
PERSONAL NOTE,
I FIND THEM

35:36.600 --> 35:38.158
BOTH DELICIOUS
AND ADORABLE,

35:38.200 --> 35:42.739
SO I HAVE, AS YOU SAY,
A CONFLICT.

35:42.770 --> 35:46.900
NOW, IF I MAY BE BOTHERING YOU
ONE MORE TIME,

35:46.940 --> 35:48.874
CAN YOU SHOW ME
WHERE THE CLOSEST HOUSE

35:48.910 --> 35:50.935
OF THE PROSTITUTES--
- HEY.

35:50.980 --> 35:52.208
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.810
I WILL JUST GO
UPON MY MERRY WAY.

35:56.650 --> 35:58.914
[overlapping shouts]

35:58.950 --> 36:02.886
- GUYS, RUN!

36:04.430 --> 36:07.820
[both grunt]

36:07.860 --> 36:08.827
- WHERE DID HE GO?

36:08.860 --> 36:13.888
- [grunts]

36:13.930 --> 36:15.397
- FIND HER!

36:15.440 --> 36:16.896
- I CAN'T SEE!

36:16.940 --> 36:17.964
- MY EYES!

36:18.000 --> 36:19.809
- I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR EYES!

36:19.840 --> 36:21.671
FIND THEM!

36:21.710 --> 36:23.974
- WHERE ARE THEY?
- OCCUPIED!

36:24.010 --> 36:25.841
OH, GUS, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

36:25.880 --> 36:27.677
- I GOT YOUR LAST MESSAGE.
- I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D COME.

36:27.710 --> 36:29.439
- FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS,
I GOT HERE RIGHT IN TIME.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.515
DUKE AND HIS THUGS
ARE IN THE NEXT ROOM,

36:30.550 --> 36:31.881
LOOKING FOR YOU.
WE GOTTA GO.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.285
- LOOK, BEFORE I USE YOU
AS A HUMAN SHIELD,

36:33.320 --> 36:34.958
THERE'S SOME THINGS
I WANT TO SAY.

36:34.990 --> 36:36.810
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE TERRIFIED
AND AFRAID OF CHANGE

36:36.860 --> 36:38.384
AND THAT YOU HATE
TITO JACKSON'S BIRTHDAY,

36:38.430 --> 36:40.955
BUT I WILL ALWAYS BE HERE,
UNLESS YOU KEEP ACTING

36:40.990 --> 36:42.548
LIKE YOU HAVE
THESE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.465
- I WON'T.
I PROMISE.

36:44.500 --> 36:47.389
WHAT I HATE IS HOW LITTLE IS
MADE OF TITO JACKSON'S BIRTHDAY.

36:47.430 --> 36:48.931
I WILL NEVER JEOPARDIZE

36:48.970 --> 36:50.938
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH RACHAEL EVER AGAIN.

36:50.970 --> 36:54.804
THAT'S HOW SOME GROWN-ASS MEN
SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.728
- MAN, WHAT'S UP--
[gunshot]

36:56.780 --> 36:59.499
- HUMAN SHIELD, HUMAN SHIELD!
- GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME!

36:59.550 --> 37:02.542
[both whimpering]

37:02.580 --> 37:04.480
- O.J., COME WITH ME
IF YOU WANT TO LIVE.

37:04.520 --> 37:05.987
- WHAT? HE BETTER BE
TALKING TO YOU.

37:06.020 --> 37:09.615
- HE IS.

37:09.660 --> 37:10.684
- [grunts]

37:10.720 --> 37:12.256
- RICO!

37:12.290 --> 37:14.895
- FOLLOW ME.

37:14.930 --> 37:16.420
- HE MUST BE
OUT OF HIS DAMN MIND.

37:16.460 --> 37:17.722
- GUS, I THINK
I'VE GOT THAT.

37:17.760 --> 37:18.920
- NO, YOU DON'T.
- SHOOT AT THEM!

37:18.970 --> 37:19.925
[gunshot]
- OH!

37:19.970 --> 37:22.962
RUN!

37:23.000 --> 37:24.467
[gunshots]

37:24.510 --> 37:26.307
- THESE GUYS ARE CRAZY.
THEY'RE SHOOTING BLIND.

37:26.340 --> 37:27.807
- THAT'S BECAUSE I SPRAYED THEM
IN THE FACE WITH PESTICIDE.

37:27.840 --> 37:30.434
- WHAT?
- DON'T LET THEM ESCAPE!

37:30.480 --> 37:32.471
- YOU DID THE EXTERMINATOR MAN
WITH THAT STUPID ACCENT?

37:32.510 --> 37:34.876
- [shouting]

37:34.920 --> 37:37.047
HE IS FROM ICELAND.
- HE'S NOT FROM ICELAND.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.445
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE'S FROM!

37:38.490 --> 37:41.880
- WHERE'S--
[gunshot]

37:41.920 --> 37:43.956
- GUS, IT'S JUST LIKE PITFALL.
- WHAT?

37:43.990 --> 37:46.424
- JUST JUMP.
KNOCK 'EM OUT.

37:46.460 --> 37:48.792
- AAH!
- LET GO!

37:48.830 --> 37:51.469
WHY DIDN'T YOU LET GO?
- BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T LET GO!

37:51.500 --> 37:54.936
- WHOA!
- [groans]

37:54.970 --> 37:57.564
[with accent]
OH, HELLO.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.431
- GOOD-BYE.
[door slams open]

37:59.470 --> 38:01.677
- POLICE!

38:01.710 --> 38:02.802
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.774
HANDS UP!
- DROP IT.

38:04.810 --> 38:07.449
DROP IT.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.914
- DUDE, IS IT IRONIC

38:09.950 --> 38:11.440
THAT I'VE HAD TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM

38:11.490 --> 38:12.718
THIS ENTIRE TIME?

38:12.750 --> 38:15.014
- MAN,
NOW I HAVE TO GO TOO.

38:20.890 --> 38:22.858
- [gaSPSI
WHAT ARE THESE FOR?

38:22.900 --> 38:24.367
- JUST A LITTLE THAN K-YOU

38:24.400 --> 38:26.789
FOR LETTING MARLOWE
STAY AT YOUR PLACE,

38:26.830 --> 38:28.468
BUT WE WON'T BE NEEDING
YOUR HELP ANYMORE.

38:28.500 --> 38:29.899
- OH?

38:29.940 --> 38:31.567
- URSULA CANCELLED
MARLOWE'S DRUG TEST.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.669
GAVE US HER OFFICIAL APPROVAL
TO MOVE IN TOGETHER.

38:33.710 --> 38:36.873
- AW, THAT MAKES ME VERY HAPPY.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

38:36.910 --> 38:38.775
ALTHOUGH WE'RE STILL NOT SURE
WHY SHE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.

38:38.810 --> 38:41.847
- THIS IS TO THANK YOU
FOR HOOKING ME UP

38:41.880 --> 38:44.348
WITH THAT DELIGHTFUL,
WONDERFUL,

38:44.390 --> 38:47.882
PLAYFUL ANGEL OF A WOMAN,
URSULA.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.785
YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE WE'RE EACH

38:49.820 --> 38:50.980
WHAT THE OTHER'S BEEN
LOOKING FOR.

38:51.020 --> 38:55.696
- HMM.

38:55.730 --> 38:57.357
[laughs]

38:57.400 --> 39:00.995
- YOU'RE GOOD, LADY.
YOU'RE GOOD.

39:01.030 --> 39:02.861
- HMM.

39:02.900 --> 39:04.765
- STILL NO WORD
FROM RACHAEL, HUH?

39:04.810 --> 39:06.937
- NAH. SHE WENT ALL HALLE BERRY
IN BOOMERANG ON A BROTHER.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.437
- [laughs]

39:08.480 --> 39:09.833
YOU SHOULD GO FIND
THAT SAME KID

39:09.880 --> 39:10.972
THAT EDDIE USED
AT THE END OF THE MOVIE,

39:11.010 --> 39:12.739
TUG ON HER HEARTSTRINGS
A LITTLE.

39:12.780 --> 39:14.418
OF COURSE, THAT KID'S
PROBABLY 30 BY NOW.

39:14.450 --> 39:15.747
- YOU THINK?

39:15.780 --> 39:17.816
- HEY, IT'S THE THOUGHT
THAT COUNTS.

39:17.850 --> 39:19.681
- I JUST NEED TO TELL HER
HOW I FEEL.

39:19.720 --> 39:25.522
THE SURPRISING THING IS, I
ACTUALLY MISS MAX A LITTLE TOO.

39:25.560 --> 39:26.982
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING HERE?

39:27.030 --> 39:31.421
- SOMEONE WAS MISSING YOU.
CAN WE TALK?

39:31.470 --> 39:32.425
- YES, WE CAN.

39:32.470 --> 39:33.892
MAX, YOU STAY HERE

39:33.930 --> 39:35.431
WHILE GUS AND I HAVE A LITTLE
CHAT WITH YOUR MOTHER.

39:35.470 --> 39:36.437
- SHAWN.

39:36.470 --> 39:37.596
- ON SECOND THOUGHT,

39:37.640 --> 39:38.868
I'M GONNA HANG HERE
WITH YOU

39:38.910 --> 39:40.764
WHILE GUS HANDLES THIS
ON HIS OWN.

39:40.810 --> 39:43.506
HELLO, RA-CHAEL.

39:43.540 --> 39:44.677
- DOCTOR.

39:44.710 --> 39:48.976
- [laughs]

39:49.020 --> 39:51.170
[sighs]

39:51.220 --> 39:53.745
YOU REALIZE THAT IS
THE COOLEST DUDE

39:53.790 --> 39:56.452
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD,
RIGHT?

39:56.490 --> 39:58.526
- I KNOW.
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.152
- I'M SORRY ABOUT POPPING IN
LIKE THIS,

40:00.190 --> 40:01.999
BUT SHAWN CALLED
AND EXPLAINED HIS ROLE

40:02.030 --> 40:03.759
IN EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN US.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.963
HE THEN EXPLAINED HIS ROLE
IN SOME HEROIC THINGS

40:07.000 --> 40:08.865
THAT HISTORICALLY
CANNOT BE POSSIBLE.

40:08.900 --> 40:12.063
- THAT'S MY BOY.
- BUT I'M GLAD HE DID.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.977
I WAS KIND OF MISSING YOU.
- REALLY?

40:15.010 --> 40:17.638
- BUT MORE THAN THAT,
MAX HAS BEEN A DIFFERENT KID

40:17.680 --> 40:19.648
SINCE SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU AND SHAWN.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.070
HE'S BEEN MORE OUTGOING,
MORE CONFIDENT.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.008
I KNOW I WORRY ABOUT HIM
SO MUCH,

40:25.050 --> 40:28.508
AND I KNOW IT'S GOOD FOR HIM
TO LET LOOSE A LITTLE.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.811
BUT YOU KNEW THAT,
DIDN'T YOU?

40:29.860 --> 40:31.623
- WELL, YOU KNOW.

40:31.660 --> 40:32.957
- BUT YOU WON'T BE TAKING HIM
OUT FOR A WHILE.

40:32.990 --> 40:34.457
- I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.491
- AND NO MORE ARRESTS
OR DEAD BODIES.

40:36.530 --> 40:38.964
- I PROMISE, WE'LL BE
THE PERFECT ROLE MODELS.

40:44.270 --> 40:46.135
- REMEMBER,
FOOD CHALLENGE RULES STATE,

40:46.170 --> 40:47.967
YOU ONLY GET THIS FIVER

40:48.010 --> 40:49.830
IF YOU DRINK EVERY LAST DROP
OF THAT PICKLE JUICE.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.075
ARE WE CLEAR?
ALL RIGHT.

40:52.110 --> 40:53.702
- WAIT, MAX.
- SHAWN.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.149
- WHAT?

40:55.180 --> 40:57.171
- [sighs]
