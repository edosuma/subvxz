00:47.839 --> 00:49.883
<i>Glendale, California.</i>

01:12.781 --> 01:13.615
<i>Whatever</i>

01:17.243 --> 01:19.496
<i>I went down to the beach and saw Kiki</i>

01:19.496 --> 01:21.998
<i>She was all like, "Ehh"
And I'm like, whatever</i>

01:25.502 --> 01:27.587
<i>Then this chick comes up to me
And she's all like</i>

01:27.587 --> 01:29.672
<i>"Hey, aren't you that dude?"
And I'm like, yeah, whatever</i>

01:33.343 --> 01:36.179
<i>So later, I'm at the pool hall
And this girl comes up</i>

01:36.179 --> 01:38.598
<i>And she's all like, "Aww"
And I'm like, yeah, whatever</i>

01:40.809 --> 01:44.270
<i>'Cause this is my
United States of Whatever</i>

01:46.564 --> 01:50.151
<i>And this is my United States of Whatever</i>

01:52.904 --> 01:56.241
<i>And this is my United States of Whatever</i>

01:58.076 --> 01:59.244
Lucas!

02:00.078 --> 02:02.747
<i>And then it's 3 a.m.
I'm on the corner wearing my leather</i>

02:02.747 --> 02:05.667
<i>And this dude comes up and he's like
"Hey, punk!" I'm like, yeah, whatever</i>

02:07.752 --> 02:08.837
Lucas.

02:08.837 --> 02:11.714
<i>Then I'm throwing dice in the alley
Officer Leroy comes up</i>

02:11.714 --> 02:14.509
<i>He's like, "Hey, I thought I told you"
And I'm like, yeah, whatever</i>

02:17.345 --> 02:19.931
One, two...

02:19.931 --> 02:22.183
<i>Then up comes Zafo
I'm like, "Yo, Zafo. What's up?"</i>

02:22.183 --> 02:23.768
<i>He's like, "Nothin'"
And I'm like, "That's cool"</i>

02:24.978 --> 02:28.231
<i>'Cause this is my
United States of Whatever</i>

02:30.733 --> 02:33.987
<i>And this is my United States of Whatever</i>

02:50.336 --> 02:51.963
That's my agent, fellas.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.675
So what'd I do right this time?

02:55.675 --> 02:58.219
I've got bad news and bad news.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.221
Let's start with the bad.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.181
Very well.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.850
Lucas, between your string
of box-office bombs

03:03.850 --> 03:06.853
and reports
of your toxic skater boi behavior,

03:06.853 --> 03:10.565
this town's on the verge of saying,
"See you later, boi."

03:10.565 --> 03:13.651
You are one mistake away from movie jail!

03:13.651 --> 03:16.154
Good thing I've got
a get-out-of-jail-free card...

03:16.988 --> 03:18.072
this smile!

03:19.574 --> 03:23.161
You realize I can't see you, right?
We're on the phone, yeah?

03:23.161 --> 03:25.872
Lucas, you need to get your act together.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.082
My act is acting.

03:28.082 --> 03:31.169
You want goody-two-shoes,
buy 'em at a shoe store.

03:31.169 --> 03:35.256
Well, that's just the sort of thing that's
made you nigh unemployable, isn't it?

03:35.256 --> 03:39.552
We've got one offer for a lead role.
I suggest you take it!

03:39.552 --> 03:42.513
It's probably going to be
the last one for a while!

03:42.513 --> 03:45.308
Your flight to Toronto
departs in four hours.

03:45.308 --> 03:50.688
And remember, you must be professional
at every opportunity,

03:50.688 --> 03:55.568
or the stardom you love so much
will slip through your grasp.

03:57.779 --> 04:04.744
<i>The stardom you love so much
will slip through your grasp.</i>

04:08.289 --> 04:09.374
Whatever.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.670
<i>'Cause this is my
United States of Whatever</i>

04:15.755 --> 04:19.217
<i>And this is my United States of Whatever</i>

06:31.182 --> 06:32.850
While we appreciate your passion,

06:32.850 --> 06:37.146
no one visits the set of a Lucas Lee movie
without explicit permission.

06:38.314 --> 06:39.899
Lucas Lee is here?

06:39.899 --> 06:42.819
Of course he's here.
What do you think our job is?

06:42.819 --> 06:45.905
Oh man!
Do you think we could have a selfie?

07:09.846 --> 07:11.097
Young Neil?

07:11.097 --> 07:13.641
Ramona! Love the new hair.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.602
Have a seat.
They're about to roll the camera.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.480
Not like a bowling ball.
The camera doesn't roll at all.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.232
You learn a lot on a movie set.

07:29.031 --> 07:32.034
Why does the set look
exactly like The Rockit?

07:32.034 --> 07:35.204
The director thinks sets
are more authentic than locations.

07:35.204 --> 07:38.749
They don't consult me on those decisions.
I'm just the writer.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.168
Of this movie?

07:41.085 --> 07:42.295
You wrote a movie?

07:42.795 --> 07:43.629
Yes.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.090
You wrote a Lucas Lee movie.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.717
Bring in first team!

07:50.887 --> 07:51.888
Let's go.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.691
Hey, Young Neil.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.527
Why is Envy Adams dressed like me?

08:06.527 --> 08:08.154
She's playing Ramona Flowers.

08:09.030 --> 08:09.864
Okay.

08:10.364 --> 08:13.409
Young Neil, what's the title
of this movie?

08:13.409 --> 08:14.619
Quiet on the set!

08:15.912 --> 08:18.247
<i>Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life.</i>

08:18.247 --> 08:19.540
Scene 12, take 1.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.335
Action!

08:22.919 --> 08:26.047
So are you a fan of Sex Bob-omb?

08:26.047 --> 08:29.425
No, I'm kind of seeing
someone in the band.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.136
That's crazy! I am too!

08:33.262 --> 08:37.558
So, I just want to make sure
I understand what's happening here.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.604
We're both dating Scott
at the same time and don't know it?

08:41.604 --> 08:44.607
Cut! Yes, our lead character is flawed.

08:45.358 --> 08:49.070
You wrote an entire script
about a world where Scott Pilgrim

08:49.070 --> 08:51.072
won the fight with Matthew Patel?

08:51.072 --> 08:52.240
Basically.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.116
Do you know where I can find Lucas Lee?

08:56.619 --> 08:57.703
Wait.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.622
Who is he playing in this?

09:09.215 --> 09:12.718
Did you know in the U.S.
these are called Mario Karts?

09:12.718 --> 09:13.928
That can't be true.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.972
How would you know that?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.807
I'm from the U.S.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.601
Well, they're definitely
called that in Japan.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.436
Pretty sure that's not true either.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.522
Agree to disagree.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.651
There's Lucas Lee's trailer.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.114
Thanks for the tour.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.031
Anytime.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.075
I know my way around the studio.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.664
I don't know where I am!

09:46.502 --> 09:47.420
Someone's outside.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.798
Who is it? I'm working on my lines.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.425
It's Ramona.

09:52.967 --> 09:53.926
Flowers.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.185
Oh my god!

10:04.020 --> 10:06.188
Ramona Flowers.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.565
Been a while.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.275
Freshman year, high school.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.569
We need to talk.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.945
I'm not sure we do.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.197
About Scott Pilgrim.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.490
I'm Scott Pilgrim.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.743
No, the real Scott Pilgrim.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.120
You saying I'm a fake Scott Pilgrim?

10:21.120 --> 10:24.123
No, the Scott Pilgrim
your character is based on.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.751
I didn't know this was a biopic.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.836
No, it's more like...

10:28.836 --> 10:31.756
Wait, do you even know
what this movie is about?

10:32.340 --> 10:33.507
Have you read the script?

10:33.507 --> 10:34.634
I read the title.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.886
Maybe you should read a little more.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.931
Well, as not fun as it's been to catch up,
I'm needed on set.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.810
We're about to shoot my first scene.
Gotta give the people what they want.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.021
Crank that Lucas Lee charm to 11.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.273
- I think you're a 12.
- Let's make out.

10:50.441 --> 10:53.402
Damn girl! What are you doing later?

10:55.738 --> 10:57.073
Are you hitting on me?

10:57.823 --> 11:00.910
Maybe I am, and maybe I am.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.705
Gross.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.085
My Lord!

11:22.598 --> 11:24.058
Ramona Flowers.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.810
Didn't expect to see you here.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.061
Seeking fame?

11:27.645 --> 11:28.729
Not my style.

11:30.064 --> 11:33.651
Still on the search for my old roommate,
what's-his-name.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.902
Any progress?

11:34.902 --> 11:35.861
Minimal.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.781
But hopefully that's about to change.
What brings you here?

11:39.365 --> 11:42.284
I heard they hired
a notorious heterosexual to play me.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.954
Needed to see this debacle up close.

11:44.954 --> 11:45.871
Action!

11:48.332 --> 11:50.459
I had a dream about that girl again.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.921
I didn't care the first time you told me.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.923
I care even less now.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.886
Cut! Let's go again.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.766
Hey, how was that? Gay enough? Any notes?

12:05.766 --> 12:09.895
Yeah. How about you build
a time machine, go back in time,

12:09.895 --> 12:12.356
and never audition for this part
in the first place.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.400
Am I being heckled?

12:14.400 --> 12:18.696
Who has the nerve to share
his opinions on the set of my film?

12:18.696 --> 12:20.448
Me. I have the nerve.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.450
You? What's your name?

12:23.784 --> 12:24.869
I'm Wallace Wells.

12:27.037 --> 12:30.791
Method, wow! Bold, confident, impressive.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.585
I love it!

12:36.630 --> 12:38.257
What's happening right now?

12:39.425 --> 12:40.468
Have you acted before?

12:40.468 --> 12:43.471
I considered it.
But I was worried I'd be too good at it.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.015
Wonderful! The part's yours.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.099
What about the other guy?

12:47.099 --> 12:49.268
He's already been escorted off set.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.062
What?

12:53.397 --> 12:54.690
Everybody, take five

12:54.690 --> 12:57.151
while we get our new Wallace
to hair and makeup.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.696
You heard him, everybody!
Take five, people.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.366
Hey, Young Neil.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.078
How'd you know exactly what Scott and I
said in bed that morning?

13:09.747 --> 13:12.124
The creative process is a mystery.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.376
Congrats on skipping
all the traditional steps

13:14.376 --> 13:16.253
to becoming a major movie star.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.380
Hey, if Lucas Lee can do it, why not?

13:18.380 --> 13:19.757
Speaking of which,

13:19.757 --> 13:22.384
I hear Mr. Lee is already
balls deep in a sweaty affair

13:22.384 --> 13:24.136
with someone on the production.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.639
You catch any gossip
on who the lucky lady might be?

13:26.639 --> 13:30.810
Not the mystery I'm trying to solve.
And on that note, wish me luck.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.771
Hey, you could always wish upon a star.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.774
The star being me.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.031
It's Ramona.

13:45.699 --> 13:48.118
I'm reading the script.
I'm busy. Come back later.

13:48.118 --> 13:51.247
I'm not falling for that.
I know you have a girl in there.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.165
Can we just get this over with?

13:54.792 --> 13:56.377
Fine. It's open.

14:02.925 --> 14:03.843
No girl.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.846
Did you know I'm in this?

14:07.763 --> 14:09.348
Yeah. You're the lead.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.976
No, there's a Lucas Lee character,

14:11.976 --> 14:14.228
and Scott tricks him
into grinding to death.

14:14.228 --> 14:17.690
I'd never fall for that.
What kind of idiot would write this?

14:25.573 --> 14:27.950
Who put that garbage can there?

14:30.494 --> 14:33.914
Wow, that's a fast garbage can!

14:34.748 --> 14:36.333
So this movie is what would've happened

14:36.333 --> 14:38.961
if Scott won the fight
against Matthew Patel?

14:38.961 --> 14:39.962
Yeah.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.589
Scott defeats all your exes,

14:41.589 --> 14:43.799
and the two of you
live happily ever after.

14:43.799 --> 14:47.303
Young Neil may not be the brightest,
but he has a vivid imagination.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.263
The ending is unrealistic.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.974
The Ramona Flowers I know
would be on to the next one.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.976
That was a long time ago.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.603
Feels like yesterday.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.607
Why are you here?

14:59.607 --> 15:01.233
Scott's not dead.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.528
Someone wants us to think he is.

15:04.528 --> 15:05.613
Who?

15:05.613 --> 15:06.530
Why?

15:07.031 --> 15:09.116
That's what I'm trying to find out.

15:09.116 --> 15:13.120
Is there anyone from my past
who would do something this messed up?

15:13.704 --> 15:17.207
You think I'd kidnap some Canadian loser
and fake his death?

15:17.791 --> 15:21.045
You willfully chose to join
a league of evil exes.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.172
I need to know how evil you really are.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.383
We're not really evil. It's just branding.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.968
I know your reputation.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.223
You're a quintessential Hollywood bad boy.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.850
You can't judge me.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.478
You're on a quest to find a guy
who was dating a high schooler.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.229
I'd never do anything that stupid.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.357
If I did, my career would be over.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.275
Lucas.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.363
My God!

15:48.447 --> 15:49.365
<i>This just in.</i>

15:49.365 --> 15:54.370
<i>The actor playing Scott Pilgrim is dating
an actress playing a high schooler.</i>

15:55.204 --> 15:57.206
<i>That's actually hilarious!</i>

15:57.206 --> 15:59.500
You're dating a 17-year-old?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.502
She's 31 in real life!

16:03.921 --> 16:05.839
An earthquake in Toronto?

16:05.839 --> 16:07.758
No, something worse.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.222
Paparazzi!

16:28.988 --> 16:30.114
Leave her alone!

16:30.781 --> 16:32.282
Go! I'll cover you.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.161
Lucas!

16:44.962 --> 16:48.382
We have you surrounded, actor scum!
Show yourself!

17:07.526 --> 17:08.402
Whatever.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.905
<i>Lucas Lee versus the paparazzi.</i>

17:11.905 --> 17:12.865
<i>Fight!</i>

19:56.945 --> 20:02.993
<i>The stardom you love so much
will slip through your grasp.</i>

20:11.919 --> 20:13.128
Need an assist?

20:13.712 --> 20:15.631
Why would you help me?

20:16.340 --> 20:19.009
What do you mean? I always helped you.

20:37.736 --> 20:38.612
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:40.489 --> 20:42.950
<i>Until you left me
with nothing but a broken heart.</i>

20:50.624 --> 20:51.959
<i>And a broken board.</i>

20:54.336 --> 20:56.922
<i>That was the day I decided
who I was gonna be.</i>

20:56.922 --> 21:01.510
<i>The best skater,
the highest paid actor, the biggest star.</i>

21:04.221 --> 21:06.765
That day made me who I am.

21:06.765 --> 21:11.561
So I guess, in a way,
I have to thank you, Ramona.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.982
That's really nice and all,
but we're out of time.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.776
Are you gonna let me help you or not?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.696
Lucas Lee, we know you're in there!

21:48.765 --> 21:49.641
All clear.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.269
I just got off the phone with my agent.

21:52.269 --> 21:55.439
I'm off the movie.
And she's dumping me as a client.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.275
Well, there goes my career.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.819
It's like I'm a show
that's no longer on the air.

22:00.819 --> 22:01.737
I'm a...

22:02.696 --> 22:04.906
Damn. I wish there was a word for it.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.078
Maybe this will all blow over.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.832
Nah, they're already testing
new actors to play Scott.

22:13.832 --> 22:14.958
By tomorrow morning,

22:14.958 --> 22:18.003
someone else will be cast in the role
of the guy you like more than me.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.047
And I'll be back to being nobody.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.968
That was your cue to say something, like,
"You were never nobody, Lucas."

22:25.719 --> 22:29.765
Well, you were definitely nobody,
but I still made out with you.

22:31.558 --> 22:32.726
Hey, I'll take it.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.441
Still think I kidnapped
the real Scott Pilgrim?

22:40.025 --> 22:40.942
No.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.861
I don't see you as a kidnapping guy.

22:42.861 --> 22:43.945
Or a portal guy.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.573
Good. Because I didn't.

22:46.573 --> 22:49.701
That was the night
of the <i>Teen Sorcerer 4</i> premiere in L.A.

22:50.285 --> 22:52.412
I got blitzed
and puked on Winifred Hailey.

22:52.412 --> 22:54.331
You can find the photos online.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.167
Guess someone else
took your stupid boyfriend.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.169
He's not my boyfriend.

22:59.795 --> 23:02.672
Whoever did this kept that train
from leaving the station.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.008
Take care of yourself, Lucas.

23:07.886 --> 23:08.720
Whatever.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.996
Vegan powers.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.832
Vegan portals?

23:40.919 --> 23:42.295
Yes, hello.

23:42.295 --> 23:43.463
I'm Todd Ingram.

23:44.047 --> 23:47.342
I'm vegan, and I'm here to audition
for the part of Scott Pilgrim.

23:47.342 --> 23:49.177
Scott Pilgrim?

23:49.177 --> 23:51.221
You mean the lead role in this picture?

23:51.221 --> 23:53.265
Well, good luck.

23:54.057 --> 23:56.101
Watch out, guys. Vegan coming through.
