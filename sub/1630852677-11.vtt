a flash of recognition there.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.328
I took
a facial recognition course.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.156
I got a perfect score
even though

11:19.200 --> 11:22.116
I had to take the test
when I had pink eye.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.726
All right, look,
here's the deal.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.423
All these records
are of Sam's patients.

11:25.467 --> 11:28.644
Do you see anything there
that connects them?

11:28.688 --> 11:29.950
These people
are all from town,

11:29.993 --> 11:31.821

11:31.865 --> 11:33.693
They barely came to the clinic.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.303
They're all Sam's house calls.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.739
All right, well,

Yes, yes.

search the town.

a young boy a camera

Ugh!

13:38.165 --> 13:40.210
Can't get a decent bagel
in this damn town.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.952
That's the one thing I miss
about D.C., the food.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.954
Hell, last week, I was halfway
through a Rocky Mountain oyster

13:44.998 --> 13:47.130
before realizing
I was eating a bull nut.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.653
I didn't even know
to be on the lookout for that.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.133
Nobody ever told me,

13:50.177 --> 13:51.874
"Someday somebody gonna put
something on your plate

13:51.918 --> 13:53.702
"and you gonna think it's food,

13:53.745 --> 13:55.095
and it's actually gonna be
a bull nut."

13:55.138 --> 13:57.793
Did you want me to get you,
uh, the corn dog

13:57.837 --> 13:59.360
from the kids' menu
at the diner?

13:59.403 --> 14:01.057
No,
I only order that

14:01.101 --> 14:02.842
'cause it comes
with a free coloring book.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.452
I've already done
all the pictures.

14:06.802 --> 14:07.977
Guess what.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.458
This wallet was found
this morning

14:10.501 --> 14:12.764
on a street a few miles
outside of Patience.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.288
Belongs to Vincent Grillo.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.333
Isn't that
one of our hit men?

14:16.377 --> 14:17.639
Damn right, it is.

14:17.682 --> 14:19.119
Nobody drops a wallet
from a car either,

14:19.162 --> 14:20.424
so that means
they're probably on foot.

14:20.468 --> 14:21.991
They could still be in town.

14:23.079 --> 14:24.602
Oh, Jesus Christ,
this thing smells

14:24.646 --> 14:27.475
like it was puked
out of an ass factory.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.869
Where exactly
did you find that?

14:29.912 --> 14:31.914
Old Mill Road
near Ridgeview.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.176
Yeah.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.743
We used to go hiking there
in high school.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.788
Sir, that trail system would be

14:36.832 --> 14:38.921
a perfect place
for someone to hide.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.141
Wait a second,
if it's a great place to hide,

14:41.184 --> 14:43.230
maybe that's
where our hit men are.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.406

last spring.

He's writing

15:50.123 --> 15:52.603
No, that's
a crossword puzzle.

15:52.647 --> 15:53.996
He's made a bunch of them.

It's a coping tool

crossword puzzles.

Yeah, maybe.

Look, I've been tracking

16:07.879 --> 16:09.185
I've been tracking
internet chatter

16:09.229 --> 16:10.752
of some events
in Patience, Colorado,

16:10.795 --> 16:12.406
since we took the doctor.

16:12.449 --> 16:13.973
Unexplained power surge,

16:14.016 --> 16:15.496
blip detected
at the Ute Reservation

16:15.539 --> 16:16.758
a half hour away,

16:16.801 --> 16:18.499
woman posted a UAP video,

16:18.542 --> 16:21.371
octopus stolen
from a Japanese restaurant...

16:21.415 --> 16:24.853
which probably isn't related
but sure is weird.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.724
Your point?

16:26.768 --> 16:28.465
I don't think
this guy's an alien.

16:28.509 --> 16:32.208
I think the real alien
might still be in Patience.

16:44.699 --> 16:45.874
Max.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.268
Max!

16:49.791 --> 16:50.792
Isn't it cool?

16:50.835 --> 16:52.011
Where did you get this?

16:52.054 --> 16:53.490
The music store.

16:53.534 --> 16:54.665
They delivered it while you
were on the treadmill.

16:54.709 --> 16:55.840
Didn't you hear them come in?

16:55.884 --> 16:57.320
No, I did not.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.235
You should turn
your music down lower.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.455
Loud sounds
are bad for your ears.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.675
Max. Max!

17:04.719 --> 17:07.243
We told you that you could not
have a drum set.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.115
No, you said
you wouldn't pay for it,

17:09.158 --> 17:10.290
so I paid for it myself

17:10.333 --> 17:11.900
with the money I made
from my job.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.033
What job?

17:17.558 --> 17:19.081
Mm.

17:19.125 --> 17:22.432
Excuse me,
did you give my son money?

17:23.346 --> 17:25.522
Yes.
What is the problem?

17:25.566 --> 17:27.959
Were the bills not ironed
well enough?

17:28.917 --> 17:30.875
I will speak to him.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.529
Uh, the problem is,

17:32.573 --> 17:35.619
there is now a drum set
in my living room.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.534
That is only a problem
if you do not like

17:37.578 --> 17:39.101
the pounding of drums.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.972
- I don't.
- Then that's a problem.

17:41.016 --> 17:43.453
- Mm-hmm.
- I gave him money for chores.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.585
What?

17:44.628 --> 17:45.890
Why am I just now
hearing about this?

17:45.934 --> 17:47.370
Asta, did you know about this?

17:47.414 --> 17:49.155
- Hmm?
- Max doing chores for Harry?

17:49.198 --> 17:51.505
- Yes, she knew.
- No, I didn't.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.246
No, she didn't.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.900
I'm sure there's a perfectly
logical explanation,

17:55.944 --> 17:57.424
isn't there, Harry?

18:00.253 --> 18:03.865
The truth is,
he told me that you knew.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.433
He even said
that it was your idea.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.913
- What? He said that?
- Yes.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.350
He called me.

18:10.393 --> 18:14.223
He told me you wanted him
to come work for me

18:14.267 --> 18:17.357
to pay for the drum set because...

18:17.400 --> 18:19.054
you're poor.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.056
Well, that is not true.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.363
Do not be ashamed
of being poor.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.756
You can sell the drums
and buy food.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.107
We are not poor, okay?

18:28.150 --> 18:30.544
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with being poor.

18:30.587 --> 18:33.199
It's fine to be poor.
It's--well, it's not fine.

18:33.242 --> 18:35.157
There's a whole, you know,
terrible class system

18:35.201 --> 18:37.116
that puts--listen.

18:37.159 --> 18:40.119
Max lied to you
is the point, okay?

18:40.162 --> 18:41.598
I cannot believe he said that.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.906
He even said
that the purple workout shirt

18:44.949 --> 18:47.778
you have
with the zipper on it--

18:47.822 --> 18:49.650
said it was ugly.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.217
Okay.

18:51.260 --> 18:54.437
Well, next time, could you
please check in with us first?

18:54.481 --> 18:56.178
I mean, we can't even get him
to clean our own house.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.833
Probably because
you don't pay him enough

18:58.876 --> 19:01.531
because you're poor.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.577
You get that
straightened out?

19:03.620 --> 19:05.361
Yeah, I'm just apparently

20:57.691 --> 21:00.084
You, when you showed up here
instead of just texting me.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.303
I don't know.

21:01.347 --> 21:04.263
Got a lot going on,
I guess, and...

21:04.306 --> 21:05.568
I don't really know
where to start,

21:05.612 --> 21:09.180
so I just came up here
to clear my head.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.574
You remember
when we first met?

21:11.618 --> 21:14.273
I gave you a whole bunch
of stuff to work on.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.665
It was a disaster.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.189
You got your head
all turned around.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.583
But then we pared it down
to just one thing:

21:20.627 --> 21:23.456
keep your tips on the snow
run after run, that's right.

21:23.499 --> 21:24.805
And you did!
And then you'd work

21:24.848 --> 21:26.763
on the next thing
until you got that too.

21:26.807 --> 21:29.113
Eventually you had
the fastest zipper line

21:29.157 --> 21:30.680
in the country.

21:30.724 --> 21:31.986
And then I fell.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.161
Everyone falls.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.816
Question is, then what?

21:39.950 --> 21:42.431
You know, the Hardpack
Tournament's coming up.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.433
No, it's been way too long.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.479
Never too late
for a comeback.

21:47.523 --> 21:51.310
Maybe you just need to find
that one thing to focus on

21:51.353 --> 21:52.920
and then the rest will follow.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.966
Okay, nice.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.620
Nice calm upper body,
but I need you to keep

21:57.664 --> 21:58.665
those knees good and tight,
all right?

21:58.708 --> 22:00.841
-
- Let's try it again.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.802
I got in trouble for being
your butler, you know.

22:05.846 --> 22:08.457
I shouldn't even be
helping you anymore.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.067
Have Ms. Twelvetrees help you.

22:10.111 --> 22:13.244
Asta isn't talking
to me right now.

22:13.288 --> 22:14.594
Oh!

22:14.637 --> 22:16.770
What about that funny girl?

22:16.813 --> 22:19.642
She's walking
on those stick legs.

22:19.686 --> 22:20.948
Nope.

22:21.731 --> 22:24.038
- But you didn't even look.
- Don't need to.

22:24.081 --> 22:25.518
If it's a girl, it's not him.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.349
How do you know
it is a him?

22:31.872 --> 22:33.134
I didn't say "him."

22:33.177 --> 22:34.527
I said "shepherd's pie."

22:34.570 --> 22:37.094
That is a terrible lie.

22:37.138 --> 22:38.835
They do not even sound alike.

22:38.879 --> 22:42.012
And shepherd's pie,
that is--it's not a pie.

22:42.056 --> 22:44.928
It should be called
shepherd's meat vomit.

22:44.972 --> 22:46.843
Fine, I lied.

22:46.887 --> 22:49.672
But I promised Sahar
I wouldn't tell.

22:49.716 --> 22:50.847
She's my friend.

22:50.891 --> 22:53.415
Well, what about me?
I am your friend.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.025
You don't treat me
like I'm your friend.

22:55.069 --> 22:57.201
Well, you are not my friend.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.507
I am your friend.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.335
See? There's a difference.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.816
Sahar's my best friend.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.687
Well, if Sahar
is your friend,

23:04.731 --> 23:07.124
then you should want
to protect her.

23:07.168 --> 23:09.170
That baby eats meat.

23:09.213 --> 23:12.303
And even though
your best friend

23:12.347 --> 23:15.437
is mostly gristle,
she will still be tasty.

23:15.481 --> 23:19.833

Hey, Liv.
How you doing?

25:11.422 --> 25:13.816
So I've been looking
at these medical records.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.992
I was thinking of talking

25:16.036 --> 25:17.472
to the families
of the deceased.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.039
You know, maybe they can shed
some light on it.

25:19.082 --> 25:22.216
Yeah, um, that makes sense.

25:22.259 --> 25:23.565
The problem is,

25:23.609 --> 25:24.740
if I pull them
into the station,

25:24.784 --> 25:26.655
they may clam up.

25:26.699 --> 25:27.917
Like, you're a nurse.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.919
They may feel
more comfortable with you.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.182
Maybe we could
talk to them together.

25:32.226 --> 25:34.837
Like, here,
where they feel more safe.

25:34.881 --> 25:37.927
Oh. I don't know.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.020
Do you remember
my Aunt Cathy

25:44.064 --> 25:46.545
who passed away
about ten years ago?

25:46.588 --> 25:47.763
Yeah, of course.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.678
You guys were really close,
right?

25:49.722 --> 25:51.854
Yeah.

25:51.898 --> 25:54.553
If something nefarious
led to her death,

25:54.596 --> 25:56.337
I'd want to know.

25:56.380 --> 25:59.558
These people's families
deserve to know.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.169
Maybe this guy had something
to do with Sam's death.

26:02.212 --> 26:05.999
Maybe we can find out
what and why.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.265
Give me those.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.225
Think Cletus got
an advantage.

26:15.269 --> 26:17.706
His stubby legs keeps his nose
close to the ground.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.490
May not even need
the dogs.

26:19.534 --> 26:20.840
Way that wallet smelled,

26:20.883 --> 26:22.711
I'd probably be able
to sniff them out myself.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.147
Yeah, we'll find it.

26:24.191 --> 26:25.801
Name of the game
is determination.

26:25.845 --> 26:27.455
You search hard enough
for long enough,

26:27.498 --> 26:28.761
you always find it.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.067
Seems like you were born
for this work.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.460
Makes me wonder
how a city cop ended up

26:32.503 --> 26:33.940
in the Colorado woods.

26:33.983 --> 26:35.681
What, you sniffing down
a new trail now, Detective?

26:35.724 --> 26:36.899
Better be careful.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.031
You're not the only one
who's determined.

26:38.074 --> 26:40.120
Yeah, I'm a long way
from home.

26:40.163 --> 26:42.383
Being in these woods
of Patience is a far cry

26:42.426 --> 26:44.994
from chasing diamond thieves
off of bridges.

26:45.038 --> 26:46.953
Whoa, whoa.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.346
No way, that was you?
-

26:49.390 --> 26:51.522
I read about that,
cop jumps in the water,

26:51.566 --> 26:52.741
recovers millions in diamonds.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.438
You're the D.C. Merman?

26:54.482 --> 26:56.353
Well, it was Mer-Mike
through the department, yeah.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.921
But I snatched the diamonds
right off him mid-swim.

26:58.965 --> 27:01.881
Oh! He's got a scent.

27:01.924 --> 27:02.882
You got something, boy?
You got something?

27:02.925 --> 27:04.013
Where you going?

27:04.057 --> 27:05.624
Oh, yeah, there he go.
Go on, boy.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.931
Can you tell us why Sam
was treating your mother?

27:08.975 --> 27:12.065
Diabetes, asthma,
herniated disk,

27:12.108 --> 27:16.330
and she had this weird
nerve thing.

27:16.373 --> 27:19.550
It made her hand
look like this...

27:19.594 --> 27:21.030
I remember your dad.

27:21.074 --> 27:22.945
He had that panel van
with the painting on the side.

27:22.989 --> 27:25.600
Neptune, god of the sea.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.123
He used to take us fishing
every weekend

27:27.167 --> 27:28.472
on Hawthorne Creek.

27:28.516 --> 27:30.474
Uncle Rick
was in a ton of pain.

27:30.518 --> 27:31.824
It was colon cancer,

27:31.867 --> 27:33.869
so they had to take out
all his plumbing.

27:33.913 --> 27:36.306
By the end,
he was just skin and bones.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.308
Not that it looks bad on you.

27:38.352 --> 27:40.484
You're skin and bones
and you're cute.

27:40.528 --> 27:44.575
And cancer, course. Pancreatic.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.186
Uncle Rick
used to take us to the creek

27:46.229 --> 27:48.057
and we'd catch frogs.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.799
And we'd race 'em,
but we'd never eat them.

27:50.843 --> 27:52.801
Only sometimes.

27:52.845 --> 27:56.413
And she had this rash,
wouldn't go away.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.720
Made her hand
look like a pizza.

27:58.764 --> 28:02.158
So this...but a pizza.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.421
He just--he never got
to meet Kevin, you know,

28:04.465 --> 28:05.727
before he died.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.511
And he really loved animals.

28:07.555 --> 28:08.991
Not that you're an animal.

28:09.035 --> 28:11.994
No, no.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.174

not gonna get cancer, are you?

28:18.218 --> 28:21.264
No, because we put lotion
on your body.

31:21.836 --> 31:24.795
Why is he dressed
like a sad bear?

31:24.839 --> 31:27.407
His diaper doesn't fit
in pants.

31:27.450 --> 31:31.324
Come to me.

31:33.326 --> 31:36.416
Baby,
remember what I told you.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.722
Don't go anywhere
with strange men.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.028
Baby.

31:44.380 --> 31:45.599
No!

31:45.642 --> 31:48.210
Baby, come back, please.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.257
Remember what I taught you.

31:51.300 --> 31:52.780
Stay with me.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.915

He feels safe with me.

31:56.958 --> 31:58.960
He is safer with me.

32:02.311 --> 32:04.618

32:04.661 --> 32:07.186
I will send you

32:07.229 --> 32:08.883

32:08.927 --> 32:11.581
The cold will creep
upon your body

32:11.625 --> 32:13.453

32:13.496 --> 32:15.281
Resources are scarce.

32:15.324 --> 32:17.196

34:39.381 --> 34:40.774
No offense there, boy.

34:40.817 --> 34:43.603
Although he did do
8,821 steps today.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.344
I got him a Fitbit
for his birthday

34:45.387 --> 34:46.475
and I put it in his collar.

34:46.519 --> 34:47.650
Although the real number
is double that

34:47.694 --> 34:48.825
'cause, you know,
he got four legs.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.610
Although you gotta subtract,
like, 200

34:50.653 --> 34:52.481

34:52.525 --> 34:53.743

panting like that.

35:19.334 --> 35:21.641

- That's just how I hydrate.

35:21.684 --> 35:23.251

are not coming here

41:42.195 --> 41:46.286
is because another alien race
is already here on Earth.

41:46.329 --> 41:49.115
I do not know who they are
or what they are doing here.

41:49.158 --> 41:50.899
It's dangerous.

41:50.943 --> 41:52.379
How do you know this?

41:52.422 --> 41:56.165
It was part of Goliath's
alien baby message

41:56.209 --> 41:57.297
the night of the party.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.865
Why didn't you tell me then?

41:59.908 --> 42:02.345
Because I'm a bad friend.

42:02.389 --> 42:03.477
Oh.

42:04.870 --> 42:06.306
Oh, Harry.

42:06.349 --> 42:09.309
But I want to be
a good friend.

42:13.400 --> 42:16.055
I feel better now. Ah.

42:16.098 --> 42:19.101
We're in danger.
- Okay.

42:19.145 --> 42:22.409
Well, that is not good news,
but I'm used to it.

42:22.452 --> 42:24.411
So thank you
for sharing that with me.

42:24.454 --> 42:26.065
I know that was hard for you.

42:26.108 --> 42:28.415
- Mm.
- Yeah.

42:28.458 --> 42:30.460
Friends tell each other
the truth.

42:32.245 --> 42:33.942
They trust each other.

42:33.986 --> 42:37.163
Yes, they do.

42:37.206 --> 42:38.381
We'll deal with it together.

42:38.425 --> 42:41.733
-
- Okay?

42:41.776 --> 42:45.040

Hey.

Is this a place

42:59.577 --> 43:01.491
a shot of Jeremiah Weed?

43:02.710 --> 43:04.190
