00:01.468 --> 00:01.901
This is the

00:01.901 --> 00:02.202
This is
the Evergreen Forest.

00:03.336 --> 00:05.939
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:05.939 --> 00:09.976
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:09.976 --> 00:11.711
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.146 --> 00:15.248
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:15.849 --> 00:16.950
Yikes!

00:17.684 --> 00:19.019
Yaaaah...

00:21.988 --> 00:23.356
Yeaaaah!

00:23.356 --> 00:26.426
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.136
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.570 --> 00:38.872
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.709 --> 00:44.778
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.879 --> 00:47.013
the Raccoons!!

00:47.013 --> 00:50.316
♪ (show theme music) ♪

00:57.357 --> 00:59.959
♪ (gentle music) ♪

01:01.995 --> 01:04.230
For some, spring
spawns the dreams

01:04.230 --> 01:06.299
that long, hot
summers are made of.

01:06.299 --> 01:08.635
Like the dream of making
the big leagues.

01:08.635 --> 01:11.104
a dream Bert and Cedric have
been sharing

01:11.104 --> 01:13.740
for as long as they've been
playing the game together.

01:15.542 --> 01:18.178
And it's a hard
grounder to Bert Raccoon,

01:18.178 --> 01:20.513
who throws a perfect strike...

01:20.513 --> 01:22.115
...into the
outstretched glove of

01:22.115 --> 01:24.417
Cedric Sneer at first base!

01:24.417 --> 01:27.587
And once again,
another perfect double play

01:27.587 --> 01:30.390
is pulled off by this
incredible duo.

01:30.390 --> 01:33.493
What a team!
What a perfect pair?

01:33.493 --> 01:35.862
Hey, pass me
a pop up, Cedric!

01:35.862 --> 01:37.030
Okay!

01:38.364 --> 01:39.866
I got it! I got it!!

01:39.866 --> 01:42.102
Whoa... Aaah!

01:42.102 --> 01:43.236
Ugh!

01:44.337 --> 01:46.372
Bert, are you OK?

01:47.540 --> 01:49.142
Well, I'm fine...

01:49.142 --> 01:51.945
except for this
pounding in my head.

01:53.746 --> 01:55.882
Hey, what's going on?

01:55.882 --> 01:58.218
The sign says it all.

01:58.218 --> 02:01.621
The Mammoth Mudhens are coming
through these parts next week,

02:01.621 --> 02:03.923
on a barnstorming exhibition.

02:03.923 --> 02:07.527
The Mammoth Mudhens. Wow!

02:07.527 --> 02:09.295
They're the greatest!

02:09.295 --> 02:12.765
Mind you, they haven't been the
same since Homer Pigeon retired.

02:12.765 --> 02:15.969
You wouldn't know of any
natural ball talent

02:15.969 --> 02:19.239
around these parts, would you?
Cedric/Bert: Would we?!?

02:19.239 --> 02:22.208
There's some great
baseball talent around here.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.277
Well, Mr Mammoth has taken a

02:24.277 --> 02:26.713
personal interest in
looking for prospects.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.616
He has a fat, juicy
contract for the talent

02:29.616 --> 02:31.584
with that special quality

02:31.584 --> 02:34.721
to put the Mudhens back on top,
where they belong.

02:35.588 --> 02:38.291
They'd certainly be interested
in playing a team...

02:38.291 --> 02:39.893
you could put together.

02:39.893 --> 02:43.062
They would?
Oh, this is incredible!

02:43.062 --> 02:46.666
The Mammoth Mudhens,
here in the Evergreen Forest!

02:46.966 --> 02:48.601
Uh, when?

02:48.601 --> 02:51.004
Say... this Saturday?

02:51.004 --> 02:53.907
We'll be here!
You can bet on that!

02:53.907 --> 02:56.576
Big leagues,
here we come!

02:56.576 --> 02:59.279
Yeeeehoooo!

02:59.279 --> 03:01.514
One, two, one, two,

03:01.514 --> 03:04.050
One, two... okay, okay...

03:04.050 --> 03:07.720
Now, I want 1,000 sit-ups!
Come on. Let's go!

03:08.955 --> 03:11.357
Gee, Burt, aren't you
taking this a bit

03:11.357 --> 03:13.126
too seriously?!

03:13.126 --> 03:15.662
Yeah Bert,
we're playing baseball,

03:15.662 --> 03:17.497
not joining the Marines.

03:17.497 --> 03:18.932
Oh,

03:18.932 --> 03:21.367
all right, 500 sit-ups!

03:21.367 --> 03:24.103
Just remember,
this is our big chance!

03:24.103 --> 03:26.773
We play this game
on Saturday right,

03:26.773 --> 03:29.709
and some of us will be Mudhens!

03:29.709 --> 03:31.644
Some of us, Bert?!

03:31.644 --> 03:34.113
Yeah! Me and Cedric!

03:34.113 --> 03:35.648
Oh, that reminds me...

03:35.648 --> 03:37.584
Melissa, you take
over the practice.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.720
I'm off to get the
second half of the greatest

03:40.720 --> 03:43.156
combination in baseball! Ha-ha!

03:43.156 --> 03:46.125
Cedric! Me without Cedric
would be like...

03:46.125 --> 03:47.961
peanut butter without bananas,

03:47.961 --> 03:50.296
campfires without marshmallows.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.365
Bert without a messy room.

03:55.368 --> 03:59.572
Up up, down.
Up up, down.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.108
Gee,
Pop doing exercises?

04:02.108 --> 04:03.676
...down.

04:03.676 --> 04:06.079
Darn stocks! If they're not up,

04:06.079 --> 04:08.514
they're down!
Why do they annoy me...?

04:08.514 --> 04:10.883
Uh, I'm off
to practice, Pop.

04:10.883 --> 04:12.819
That's fine, son.

04:12.819 --> 04:13.853
Why don't they buy...?

04:13.853 --> 04:15.822
Thre's big
game this Saturday.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.090
Um, great.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.959
It's for a
Major League contract. Bye!

04:21.361 --> 04:23.229
A Major League contract?

04:23.229 --> 04:24.731
Why didn't you say so?

04:24.731 --> 04:28.368
Gee Pop, I didn't know
you were interested in baseball?

04:28.368 --> 04:29.869
Are you kidding, son?

04:29.869 --> 04:31.871
Baseball's played on a diamond.

04:31.871 --> 04:34.707
I love diamonds.
Diamonds are money!

04:34.707 --> 04:37.443
But Cedric, look at you.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.746
Uhm...
what about me, Pop?

04:39.746 --> 04:42.548
Why, if you were a fish,
you'd be thrown back,

04:42.548 --> 04:45.718
What you need is to train,
to build yourself up,

04:45.718 --> 04:47.587
to develop the kind
of figure you'd find...

04:47.587 --> 04:49.555
Upff!
...in the financial pages

04:49.555 --> 04:51.224
under Sneer!

04:51.224 --> 04:55.094
The big monies Cedric, goes
only to the big players!

04:55.094 --> 04:57.430
Keep up? I don't know.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.965
Cedric,

04:58.965 --> 05:01.334
you do want to be
in the majors, don't you?

05:01.334 --> 05:02.468
Sure!

05:02.468 --> 05:05.071
You do want to sign
your name at the bottom

05:05.071 --> 05:08.641
of a big, fat contract,
don't you?

05:08.641 --> 05:11.577
Gee Pop, I don't
care about the money,

05:11.577 --> 05:14.314
I just wanna be
a Mammoth Mudhen.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.417
You will be
a Mammoth Mudhen,

05:17.417 --> 05:20.420
with a Mammoth contract!

05:20.420 --> 05:24.724
I'll get you the finest
equipment money can buy.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.126
Well...

05:27.126 --> 05:29.262
don't just stand there, Cedric!

05:29.262 --> 05:30.496
Get to work!

05:30.496 --> 05:32.732
Sure, pop! Right away!

05:35.468 --> 05:37.170
Pig 1: Sir, Sir,

05:37.170 --> 05:40.139
there's a Major League
contract... oof...

05:42.675 --> 05:44.243
l..up for grabs!

05:44.243 --> 05:47.046
right here,
in the Evergreen forest.

05:47.046 --> 05:49.248
Pig 2: Ohh, there's
a fortune to be made,

05:49.248 --> 05:51.284
even before arbitration.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.152
Listen, bacon breaths,

05:53.152 --> 05:55.788
do you think I
spend my afternoons

05:55.788 --> 05:58.858
with my nose buried
in the stock reports?

05:58.858 --> 06:01.794
I've got Cedric out
in the field right now,

06:01.794 --> 06:04.664
securing himself the
best spot in the lineup.

06:04.664 --> 06:07.867
Pig 1: Well,
I hope he makes it, Sir,

06:07.867 --> 06:10.770
because it's going
to be mighty tough.

06:10.770 --> 06:13.973
Pig 2: Yes, Sir.
Only one can make it.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.575
Of course he'll make it.

06:15.575 --> 06:18.678
What do you mean,
only one can make it?

06:18.678 --> 06:21.848
Pig 1: Read the fine print, Sir.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.549
Let me see that!

06:23.549 --> 06:26.386
Majors... Mudhen...

06:26.386 --> 06:28.187
...one contract...

06:28.187 --> 06:29.222
Saturday.

06:29.856 --> 06:31.691
Only one contract?

06:31.691 --> 06:36.529
Well, if only one person
can win that contract,

06:36.529 --> 06:39.298
we know, who it's gonna be,

06:39.298 --> 06:40.400
don't we?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.135
The Pigs: Yes, Sir!

06:44.704 --> 06:47.473
Oh, boy, just
think of it! Haha!

06:47.473 --> 06:50.743
Bert Raccoon and Cedric Sneer

06:50.743 --> 06:53.079
in Major League Baseball.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.881
The dazzling duo...

06:54.881 --> 06:57.650
our faces on bubble gum cards.

06:57.650 --> 07:00.887
Kids asking us to
sign their gloves.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.922
Traveling long distances

07:02.922 --> 07:05.925
in a crowded, sweaty bus.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.095
It's just
too wonderful to imagine!

07:13.166 --> 07:15.435
This way,
hey, careful with that

07:15.435 --> 07:17.904
pitching machine!
Hey, watch your toes!

07:17.904 --> 07:20.373
Uh-ah...

07:20.373 --> 07:22.608
Sign here Mac.
Yeah, thanks lot, eh?

07:23.976 --> 07:26.446
Uuugh!

07:26.446 --> 07:28.848
Uh... pitching machine?!

07:28.848 --> 07:30.283
What are you doing here?

07:31.184 --> 07:33.453
I'm here to see Cedric.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.422
Cedric's busy! Scram!
Busy?!

07:36.422 --> 07:39.759
But we're supposed to practice
together this afternoon.

07:39.759 --> 07:42.061
Cancelled!
What?!

07:42.061 --> 07:44.864
But... we're an
unbeatable team,

07:44.864 --> 07:46.599
we're inseparable.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.468
That's history!

07:48.468 --> 07:50.102
Read the fine print.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.443
One contract?

07:57.443 --> 07:59.912
Only one contract?

08:00.279 --> 08:02.448
Ha-haa! And Cedric's busy

08:02.448 --> 08:04.717
getting himself into
shape right now

08:04.717 --> 08:06.919
to win the one
and only contract.

08:06.919 --> 08:09.589
What?!
I don't believe this!

08:09.589 --> 08:12.458
Cedric wouldn't
do this without me.

08:12.458 --> 08:16.729
Hey Pop,
these new uniforms are great

08:16.729 --> 08:19.465
and I love all this equipment!

08:19.465 --> 08:21.501
Pop... uhm, ehm...

08:21.501 --> 08:25.872
You mean Cedric's going
to go for the contract

08:25.872 --> 08:27.406
by himself?

08:27.406 --> 08:29.642
You catch on quick.

08:29.642 --> 08:32.778
Well, equipment
on no equipment,

08:32.778 --> 08:36.616
if there's only one contract
to be won around here,

08:36.616 --> 08:38.451
I'm gonna win it!

08:38.451 --> 08:41.821
Because I'm the best ballplayer

08:41.821 --> 08:44.123
in this neck of the woods.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.659
Ha! I never heard
of such a thing!

08:46.659 --> 08:49.028
Pop, what's going on?

08:49.028 --> 08:51.497
What does Bert mean
he's the best ball player

08:51.497 --> 08:54.867
in this neck of the woods?
We work together.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.402
Not anymore, son.

08:56.402 --> 08:59.839
The Mammoth Mudhens are
offering only one contract.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.307
Only one?!

09:01.307 --> 09:05.044
Yeah, the one
you're gonna win, son!

09:05.044 --> 09:08.981
Gee, Bert
competing against me?

09:08.981 --> 09:10.917
I don't believe it.

09:10.917 --> 09:14.554
After all those years of
playing the game together.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.756
Come here, my son.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.624
Well, that's it.

09:18.624 --> 09:21.527
If there is a contract
to be won around here,

09:21.527 --> 09:24.630
it's Cedric Sneer
who's gonna win it!

09:27.433 --> 09:29.769
Yeah well, Cedric and I

09:29.769 --> 09:31.804
will never be friends again.

09:31.804 --> 09:36.008
Now Bert, I'm sure
it's just a a misunderstanding.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.578
No. I understand alright,

09:38.578 --> 09:41.147
Cedric's got the
best of everything.

09:41.147 --> 09:44.984
Batting cages, pitching
machines, uniforms,

09:44.984 --> 09:46.252
and what have I got?!

09:46.252 --> 09:47.353
Talent?

09:47.353 --> 09:49.689
Yeah, no fancy equipment.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.691
Just... talent!!!

09:51.691 --> 09:53.326
Yeah!

09:53.326 --> 09:55.695
And an awesome talent.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.330
Incredible ability,

09:57.330 --> 09:59.231
an arm like a slingshot!

09:59.231 --> 10:01.100
The eye of an eagle.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.669
And the helping
hand of a coach, Bert!

10:03.669 --> 10:05.705
I do?! Who?

10:06.439 --> 10:08.474
Me!
You?

10:08.474 --> 10:10.443
What do you know about baseball?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.878
Well, I know that
it takes hard training,

10:12.878 --> 10:15.081
discipline and teamwork.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.483
Yeah, teamwork!

10:17.483 --> 10:20.419
Me and my awesome ability!

10:20.419 --> 10:22.254

Hello Melissa!
Huh?!

11:26.952 --> 11:28.754
What are you doing here?!

11:28.754 --> 11:31.991
Did one of your
machines breakdown?

11:31.991 --> 11:34.293
Oh, I forgot
to tell you, Bert.

11:34.293 --> 11:37.029
I invited Cedric
to practice with us.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.198
What?!
Well, after all Bert,

11:39.198 --> 11:40.933
we all have to play together.

11:40.933 --> 11:44.470
Not when there's only one
contract to be won, we don't!

11:44.470 --> 11:47.373
Let's just call it quits for
this afternoon, Melissa,

11:47.373 --> 11:49.508
Aaah, after all,
when you're hitting

11:49.508 --> 11:51.777
outside-the-park bunts...

11:51.777 --> 11:55.848
Yeah, sorry Melissa,
I can't practice either.

11:55.848 --> 11:57.616
I'm too tired.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.685
I hit so many baseballs

11:59.685 --> 12:01.687
into the streets this morning

12:01.687 --> 12:04.790
that our weatherman
reported snow.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.358
Ohh...

12:06.358 --> 12:08.327
Listen guys, we're gonna need

12:08.327 --> 12:10.129
one another in the big game.

12:10.129 --> 12:11.564
I think you two should consider

12:11.564 --> 12:13.666
patching up your differences.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.504
Oh, okay.

12:18.504 --> 12:21.807
By the way, Cedric,
good luck in Saturday's game.

12:21.807 --> 12:25.044
Oh, gee... thanks Bert.

12:25.044 --> 12:27.113
You're gonna need it!

12:30.549 --> 12:32.718
Funny, I heard
you weren't gonna be

12:32.718 --> 12:34.520
in Saturday's game, Bert.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.755
Oooh?!
Word is,

12:35.755 --> 12:38.023
they can't find a batting helmet

12:38.023 --> 12:39.992
big enough for your head.

12:41.660 --> 12:45.264
Well, there's only one
resident of the Evergreen Forest

12:45.264 --> 12:48.000
who's ever gonna play
in the World Series,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.935
and that's me.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.004
Says who, big shot?

12:52.004 --> 12:54.340
Says me, hose nose?

12:54.340 --> 12:55.674
Come on, guys?

12:58.878 --> 13:00.246
The Pig: Master Cedric,

13:00.246 --> 13:04.083
your father wants you back
at the house... immediately!

13:04.083 --> 13:07.386
Pig 2: Your special
batting coach has just arrived.

13:08.454 --> 13:12.558
Batting coach?!
Pig 3: Yes, Homer Pidgeon!

13:12.558 --> 13:15.694
Pig 1: And he doesn't want
to be kept waiting, Sir.

13:15.694 --> 13:19.431
Well, let's not
keep them waiting then, boys!

13:19.431 --> 13:21.066
Goodbye Melissa.

13:28.207 --> 13:29.375
Popcorn!

13:29.375 --> 13:31.243
Duck Snyder: Welcome Baseball
fans to this afternoon's

I'm Duck Snyder, yes Sir, and
we're awaiting the arrival

13:36.248 --> 13:38.617

13:38.617 --> 13:40.920
Cedric, hustle
when you're out there!

of my son, Cedric,

13:51.564 --> 13:53.799

13:58.604 --> 14:01.507
that contract is as good as won.

Mr. Mammoth:

14:05.578 --> 14:09.348
Mr. Mammoth says,
he'll be the judge of that.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.951
Ah, right!
Of course he will.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.187
Playball!

14:15.187 --> 14:17.590
The leadoff hitter
for the Evergreen Giants

14:17.590 --> 14:19.325
is Cedric Sneer.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.760
Wait 'til you
see my son at bat, Mammoth!

14:21.760 --> 14:24.363
You'll be naming a
candy bar after him.

14:29.401 --> 14:33.505
It's a solid line drive
and Sneer is safe at 1st!

14:33.505 --> 14:34.874
That a boy, Cedric!

14:34.874 --> 14:37.643
You've got almost as
much power at the plate,

14:37.643 --> 14:39.211
as I've got at the bank!

14:39.778 --> 14:43.015
Bert Raccoon now
steps up to the plate.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.116
We're gonna see somethin' here.

14:44.116 --> 14:46.485
Strike one!

14:50.155 --> 14:51.357
Here's the pitch.

14:51.357 --> 14:52.892
Bert connects!

14:53.659 --> 14:55.461
And both runners are safe!

14:56.428 --> 14:58.330
You're next up to bat,

14:58.330 --> 15:01.066
I want you to bring Cedric home,

15:01.066 --> 15:06.038
but not that grandstanding
Raccoon. Understand?

15:06.038 --> 15:07.573
The Pigs: Yes, Sir!

15:08.841 --> 15:12.578
That Raccoon's committed
his first and last error...

15:12.578 --> 15:14.880
entering this game.

15:20.185 --> 15:23.022
Well fans,
with Lloyd Pig at bat,

15:23.022 --> 15:25.190
the Evergreen Giants
are threatening.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.526
They got a man on 1st and 2nd

15:27.526 --> 15:30.930
and none, I say, not one out.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.331
Here's the pitch...

15:33.499 --> 15:35.200
The base runners
get a good jump!

15:36.435 --> 15:37.436
Upff!

15:41.740 --> 15:42.741
Upff!

15:42.741 --> 15:44.076
Ooops!

15:44.076 --> 15:46.245
A triple play!

15:46.245 --> 15:48.747
Oh! I don't believe it!

15:49.548 --> 15:52.451
Get out on that field
and redeem yourselves!

15:52.451 --> 15:55.788
And now the
Mudhens come to bat.

16:04.763 --> 16:08.367
For heaven's sake,
guys, we're on the same team!

16:11.470 --> 16:14.239
And it's a pop-up
to the short stop.

16:14.239 --> 16:16.442
Come on, baby!

16:16.442 --> 16:18.911
Hey! Whoops! Au!

16:20.980 --> 16:23.582
What a catch! Ooo-wee!

16:23.582 --> 16:26.285
Why, this short stop can
catch 'em in his sleep!

16:27.353 --> 16:28.821
Ohh!

16:29.621 --> 16:32.324
It's a towerin' hit.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.293
The Evergreen Giants
have it covered.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.562
He's out!

16:36.562 --> 16:39.131
But a Mudhen slips home!

16:39.131 --> 16:40.933
I can't believe it!

16:40.933 --> 16:42.935
This is a game of baseball,

16:42.935 --> 16:44.636
not a tug of war!

16:46.071 --> 16:49.174
Well fans, fortunately
for the Evergreen Giants,

16:49.174 --> 16:51.944
Melissa Raccoon has
kept this game close.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.847
Oh! It's goin'...it's goin'...

16:54.847 --> 16:56.782
It's... gone!

16:56.782 --> 16:59.018
...and it's a hard grounder
to the short stop.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.953
Ohh... what a snag!

17:00.953 --> 17:04.957
And that brings the Mudhens
top hitter to the plate.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.659
Jeepers, did he connect!

17:07.659 --> 17:11.130
An inside the park home run!

17:11.130 --> 17:13.465
That is a first
for this announcer...

17:13.465 --> 17:15.834
And as we head to
the top of the 9th,

17:15.834 --> 17:18.303
the Evergreen Giants
come to bat,

17:18.303 --> 17:21.040
down 5 to nothin'

17:21.040 --> 17:24.376

last chance, folks.

we talked, guys.

Cedric will start listening.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.655
not only will you
lose that contract,

17:36.655 --> 17:39.291
you'll lose a lot
more than that!

17:39.291 --> 17:41.293
Melissa's right, fellas.

17:41.293 --> 17:43.028
Teamwork wins games.

17:43.028 --> 17:45.330

20:49.014 --> 20:51.550
The Mudhens have plenty
of players of potential,

20:51.550 --> 20:54.586

what's really needed is

20:54.586 --> 20:56.588
