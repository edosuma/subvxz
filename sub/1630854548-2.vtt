04:47.659 --> 04:49.128
You're already here.

04:49.226 --> 04:50.862
Wonderful.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.765
I'm sure you all
recognize the importance
of what we're up against.

04:53.863 --> 04:57.369
I have been up all night
rehearsing various ways

04:57.468 --> 05:00.405
we can rectify
our ill-fated futures.

05:00.504 --> 05:02.374
Rita, we've been talking.

05:02.473 --> 05:05.144
Delicious, huh?

05:05.241 --> 05:08.280
Obviously, what we all
saw in the future,
we can't let happen.

05:08.378 --> 05:11.616
-We need to prevent--
-[Cliff] The impending
asspocalypse.

05:13.083 --> 05:14.486
-Exactly.
-[Rita] You're right, Victor.

05:14.584 --> 05:16.688
We need to do
everything we can.

05:16.786 --> 05:19.758
And I have thought
of everything.

05:19.858 --> 05:20.659
Believe me.

05:20.758 --> 05:21.994
As Victor was saying,

05:22.093 --> 05:24.563
we saw the future
and it was horrible.

05:24.661 --> 05:26.598
In order to prevent
that future from happening,

05:26.697 --> 05:31.303
the best strategy is to do
the opposite of whatever
we might have done

05:31.402 --> 05:33.405
-to end up in a--
-Crisis of Infinite Ass.

05:33.504 --> 05:35.640
-[Cliff chuckles] Nice.
-[Rita] Indeed.

05:35.740 --> 05:37.209
I'm sure you've all noticed

05:37.308 --> 05:40.412
that I have started wearing
flats instead of heels.

05:40.511 --> 05:43.715
Just one simple way
to act differently.

05:43.813 --> 05:46.318
And thanks
to my stretching abilities,

05:46.416 --> 05:48.988
I am still
just as tall as usual.

05:52.123 --> 05:53.092
See?

05:54.925 --> 05:56.061
[Cliff] Uh...

05:58.530 --> 05:59.498
Right.

05:59.597 --> 06:02.201
Jane, I have a few suggestions

06:02.300 --> 06:07.039
on how we can add a bit more
color to your wardrobe.

06:07.138 --> 06:10.275
Cliff, perhaps you could try
swearing a bit less.

06:10.373 --> 06:14.246
Um, you're averaging
a staggering amount
of fucks per hour.

06:14.345 --> 06:15.647
Thirty-seven.

06:15.746 --> 06:17.116
-[Cliff] Uh...
-[Vic] I think we all agree

06:17.215 --> 06:20.019
that our best option
is to change our approach.

06:21.085 --> 06:22.354
But we need to think big.

06:22.453 --> 06:24.056
It isn't just
our lives in jeopardy,

06:24.154 --> 06:27.292
the entire planet is at stake
if we don't make real change.

06:27.386 --> 06:29.028
Oh, we might not know
how we died

06:29.127 --> 06:31.463
but I'm pretty sure
it wasn't because

06:31.561 --> 06:33.332
Cliff said fuck
too many times.

06:33.431 --> 06:35.567
[Cliff] Uh, we might not
know how we died,

06:35.666 --> 06:37.970
but I'm pretty sure it had
something to do with

06:38.068 --> 06:41.706
the fucking Zombie Butts
that took over the planet!

06:41.806 --> 06:43.708
Maybe we start with that.

06:43.808 --> 06:45.077
I couldn't agree more.

06:45.176 --> 06:48.213
In fact, it is the core
of my plan, hmm?

06:48.313 --> 06:49.548
Remember,

06:49.646 --> 06:51.583
we have the upper hand here.

06:51.682 --> 06:53.818
We fought the Butts
when we were zombies.

06:53.918 --> 06:55.687
Therefore, it stands to reason

06:55.786 --> 06:59.724
that we created
these Zombie Butts.

06:59.823 --> 07:05.397
And anything we create,
we can just as easily destroy.

07:05.496 --> 07:07.866
Starting,
the scene of the crime.

07:09.466 --> 07:10.802
Darren Jones.

07:11.602 --> 07:12.837
The old barn.

07:12.937 --> 07:14.806
Does any of this ring a bell?

07:15.840 --> 07:17.576
All right, fine, I'll bite.

07:17.669 --> 07:21.113
Uh, what do you all suggest
we do to save the world?

07:29.219 --> 07:30.489
[sighs]

07:30.588 --> 07:32.557
What will you say
to a change in leadership?

07:34.458 --> 07:37.229
A new... new leadership, huh?

07:37.328 --> 07:39.531
[chuckles] Mmm-hmm.

07:39.631 --> 07:41.433
Interesting.

07:41.533 --> 07:42.462
Um...

07:42.567 --> 07:44.603
Well, I'm... I'm...

07:44.702 --> 07:48.307
I'm sure we could,
uh, take a vote on it.

07:48.405 --> 07:49.774
[clears throat] Yes.

07:49.874 --> 07:51.977
Although,
something tells me,

07:52.075 --> 07:55.614
some people might not be
as interested in a team leader

07:55.712 --> 07:59.985
that doesn't provide
egg salad sandwiches
as you seem to believe.

08:00.084 --> 08:02.821
But, yes, all right,
let's put it to a vote.

08:02.919 --> 08:07.526
All those in favor of me
remaining team leader,

08:07.626 --> 08:08.860
please raise your hand.

08:19.770 --> 08:21.806
Everyone in favor
of new leadership?

08:27.679 --> 08:28.847
[grunts softly]

08:35.586 --> 08:37.756
Wow, um... [sighs]

08:37.854 --> 08:41.326
No, uh, Victor, we have been
over this several times.

08:41.425 --> 08:42.727
You... you can't be leader,

08:42.826 --> 08:44.563
because you don't
have your tech.

08:44.661 --> 08:49.001
And... and Cliff
and Larry can't lead
because they're unqualified.

08:49.100 --> 08:50.435
[Larry groans]

08:50.534 --> 08:51.870
-And Jane doesn't even
wanna be leader.
-[Cliff] Huh?

08:51.969 --> 08:54.940
Therefore,
I am the clear choice.

08:55.039 --> 08:57.742
I am the only choice.
[chuckles]

08:57.842 --> 08:59.744
If not me, then who?

09:02.614 --> 09:03.715
Who, Victor?

09:06.418 --> 09:07.652
Who?

09:08.218 --> 09:09.221
[spits]

09:11.322 --> 09:12.257
Me?

09:13.224 --> 09:14.554
Really, me?

09:14.659 --> 09:17.296
-Really?
-[oven dings]

09:21.165 --> 09:23.402
Where's the thing?
Where's the-- Cliff.

09:23.502 --> 09:25.004
[Cliff] Oh.

09:26.604 --> 09:28.707
-[objects clattering]
-Oh, nice.

09:28.806 --> 09:33.378
Nice batch.
Would anybody like biscones?

09:33.477 --> 09:34.613
[Rita] They're not hungry.

09:34.711 --> 09:36.081
[Vic] You're not
the only candidate.

09:36.180 --> 09:39.151
The idea is that
you'll take over
on a trial basis.

09:39.249 --> 09:40.619
If you're not interested,
I'm more than happy--

09:40.717 --> 09:41.886
[Cliff]
We've been through this.

09:41.986 --> 09:43.989
We don't need
a former superhero.

09:44.088 --> 09:45.890
We need a former supervillain.

09:45.990 --> 09:47.993
Somebody willing to win
at all costs.

09:48.092 --> 09:50.895
Compare my win-loss ratio
with hers.

09:50.995 --> 09:52.464
I haven't quit
a day in my life.

09:52.563 --> 09:54.233
[Jane] Weren't you gonna stay
behind and become besties

09:54.332 --> 09:56.936
with your future self until
Rouge broke you two up?

09:57.935 --> 09:59.638
Rouge impersonated my dad,

09:59.736 --> 10:03.175
jeopardizing the trust
I was building
with a valuable asset.

10:03.273 --> 10:04.409
Look, I get it.

10:04.509 --> 10:05.477
She was ruthless.

10:05.577 --> 10:06.946
Villainous even.

10:07.044 --> 10:08.880
Is that what we need right now?

10:08.978 --> 10:11.183
[Larry] Future Vic
may have been just as culpable
as the rest of us.

10:11.281 --> 10:13.552
The only person we know
who wasn't to blame

10:13.651 --> 10:14.954
for the future is Rouge.

10:15.052 --> 10:16.956
Far as I can tell,
she wasn't even around.

10:17.054 --> 10:18.357
Having her as team leader

10:18.455 --> 10:20.025
gives us the best chance
to change everything.

10:20.124 --> 10:21.961
That's what Rita's
been saying all along.

10:22.060 --> 10:23.495
I didn't say
we should all of a sudden

10:23.593 --> 10:24.997
start making bad decisions.

10:25.096 --> 10:27.266
[Cliff] Oh, yeah,
your opposite day playbook

10:27.359 --> 10:28.700
was a work of pure genius.

10:28.799 --> 10:30.502
-Fuck you, Cliff.
-[Cliff] Fuck me? Fuck you.

10:30.602 --> 10:32.004
Say it again.

10:32.102 --> 10:33.438
I wouldn't want you to upset
your hourly average.

10:33.537 --> 10:35.807
-[Cliff] Oh! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
-23, 24, 25...

10:35.906 --> 10:37.542
-[Cliff] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
-...26, 27, 28...

10:37.641 --> 10:39.344
-[Cliff] Fuckity fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!
-...29, 30, 31, 32.

10:39.443 --> 10:41.981
-Oh, shut it!
-[Cliff] Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

10:43.547 --> 10:44.683
Rita is right.

10:44.782 --> 10:48.387
This is a bold choice.

10:48.485 --> 10:51.651
And generous of all
of you to nominate me,

10:51.756 --> 10:53.125
given that, um,

10:53.224 --> 10:54.960
I've never [chuckling]
even won a golden star.

10:55.059 --> 10:57.029
Don't play
the faux humility card,

10:57.128 --> 10:58.197
it's not going to work.

10:58.296 --> 11:00.165
You wanna talk
about gold stars?

11:00.264 --> 11:03.735
I've been up all night
working to save the world,

11:03.834 --> 11:05.537
as I've been trying
to say all morning,

11:05.636 --> 11:08.607
I've discovered the source
of the Zombie Butt...

11:08.706 --> 11:11.810
[grunts] problem. Hmm?

11:11.909 --> 11:14.113
It has to be Darren Jones.

11:14.211 --> 11:16.381
He escaped that night
after Jane bit him.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.151
-I didn't bite Darren.
-You bit him,
I bit him, who cares?

11:19.249 --> 11:21.153
It must have turned him
into a zombie.

11:21.252 --> 11:22.521
Lucky for us,

11:22.620 --> 11:25.991
I see no signs
that the infection
has spread, yet.

11:26.090 --> 11:27.826
Excellent work, Rita.

11:27.926 --> 11:30.795
And if what you have
uncovered is true

11:30.894 --> 11:33.865
then that little undead
Were-Butted snake

11:33.964 --> 11:36.801
is probably still hiding
near that old barn.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.304
-As I was saying--
-Now, if we hurry,

11:39.403 --> 11:40.805
we can exterminate Darren

11:40.905 --> 11:42.807
so he doesn't
infect anyone else.

11:42.906 --> 11:45.844
Rewriting the future
in the process,
couldn't be easier.

11:45.943 --> 11:47.479
I know and it's my plan,

11:47.578 --> 11:50.115
so I should be the one
to execute the plan.

11:50.214 --> 11:51.650
[Jane] Who cares
who gets the credit?

11:51.748 --> 11:53.085
Let's just kill
that motherfucker

11:53.183 --> 11:56.688
-and be done with this.
-Who cares about credit?

11:56.781 --> 11:59.858
I have done everything
to save you all

11:59.956 --> 12:02.127
and you're handing over
the reins to someone

12:02.226 --> 12:06.031
who's already failed at being
a hero and a villain.

12:06.130 --> 12:07.466
[sighs] I... I get it.

12:08.366 --> 12:10.035
Trust me, I do.

12:11.836 --> 12:13.172
But, for this mission,

12:15.605 --> 12:16.808
we're riding with Rouge.

12:16.908 --> 12:18.377
For better or worse.

12:21.078 --> 12:23.082
Well, you'll be
one member short.

12:23.180 --> 12:24.316
[Larry] Rita, please.

12:24.414 --> 12:26.518
No, I won't
participate in a mission

12:26.617 --> 12:28.020
where I'm not wanted.

12:28.118 --> 12:30.089
You'll all just
have to carry on without me.

12:30.187 --> 12:31.723
I wish you all good luck.

12:31.823 --> 12:32.958
You're going to need it.

12:35.694 --> 12:36.528
[clicks tongue]

12:37.494 --> 12:38.797
[exhales] Well...

12:40.598 --> 12:41.934

12:42.033 --> 12:43.602
That was hard to watch.

12:43.701 --> 12:46.906
And painful for all of you,

12:47.004 --> 12:49.241
but let's not forget

12:49.338 --> 12:53.612
that you have all
just witnessed an incredibly
traumatic sight.

12:53.711 --> 12:56.348
Future overrun
with foul beasts,

12:56.447 --> 12:58.383
all of you dead,
except for Vic.

12:58.482 --> 13:01.753
But in fairness,
your life is pretty shit.

13:01.852 --> 13:05.090
[Cliff] Can we move on
to the killing Darren Jones
part of the plan?

13:05.189 --> 13:07.159
Sure. All in due time,
Cliff, yes.

13:07.258 --> 13:10.062
But let me look over
Rita's materials,

13:10.161 --> 13:11.696
let you gather yourselves.

13:11.795 --> 13:15.334
We... we must be focused
and ready to do this right.

13:15.432 --> 13:16.796
[Larry] What...
what are you saying?

13:16.901 --> 13:18.337
You want us to take
a quick power nap

13:18.436 --> 13:20.872
and then prevent
the end of the world?

13:20.972 --> 13:22.374
I'm with LT.

13:22.473 --> 13:25.144
This isn't just some
testicle monster.

13:25.243 --> 13:26.845
For all we know,
we could die at any second.

13:26.943 --> 13:30.582
Quick and dirty can no longer
be the modus operandi.

13:30.680 --> 13:35.487
No, this mission requires
perfection, nothing less.

13:43.828 --> 13:45.164
[sighs] All right.

13:45.897 --> 13:46.966
One hour.

13:47.064 --> 13:48.333
I'll do some recon of my own

13:48.432 --> 13:50.569
to make sure
we've covered all our bases.

13:52.169 --> 13:54.106
-Good?
-Wonderful.

13:54.205 --> 13:55.908
Incredibly helpful.

13:56.007 --> 13:57.242
One hour.

13:57.341 --> 13:58.343
Dismissed.

14:04.649 --> 14:06.151
Cliff, uh, a word.

14:09.553 --> 14:14.393
You and I both know
that Darren Jones
needs to be exterminated.

14:14.492 --> 14:17.796
[Cliff] Uh, yeah.
In one hour, right?

14:17.895 --> 14:19.531
I'm gonna go watch
Rockford Files.

14:19.624 --> 14:21.766
No, no, no, not in an hour.

14:21.866 --> 14:23.002
Immediately.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.803
Time is of the fucking essence.

14:24.903 --> 14:26.638
[Cliff] But, you just said...

14:28.533 --> 14:29.641
Wait a minute.

14:29.740 --> 14:31.576
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

14:31.675 --> 14:35.114
Are you asking me to go
on a top-secret mission?

14:36.280 --> 14:37.849
[whispering]
I don't need the others.

14:37.949 --> 14:39.551
I only need you.

14:39.650 --> 14:42.787
You are literally
an indestructible
zombie-killing machine.

14:42.887 --> 14:44.456
[Cliff] Huh.

14:44.556 --> 14:46.558
What do you say, Cliffy?

14:46.657 --> 14:48.593
Do you wanna go
and save the fucking world

14:48.687 --> 14:51.096
from some motherfucking Butts?

14:51.896 --> 14:53.398
[Cliff] Fuck yes!

14:57.934 --> 14:59.104
[man on intercom]
State your name.

14:59.203 --> 15:02.041
Yu. Doctor Margaret Yu.

15:02.140 --> 15:03.275
[device beeping]

15:05.175 --> 15:07.512
[indistinct chatter]

15:10.114 --> 15:12.817
-Doctor Yu.
-Hey.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.319
Welcome to the Ant Farm,
Doctor Yu.

15:14.418 --> 15:16.255
I apologize that you weren't
briefed more thoroughly.

15:18.088 --> 15:21.226
The project you'll be
interfacing with
is highly classified.

15:21.325 --> 15:22.627
Highest clearance only.

15:22.726 --> 15:25.197
Oh, uh,
how secret is that exactly?

15:25.295 --> 15:27.967
Am I allowed to tell
my bowling league?

15:28.065 --> 15:29.234
I would trust them
with my life.

15:29.333 --> 15:30.669
-[chuckles]
-[machine beeps]

15:30.768 --> 15:32.171
It's fine, I get it.

15:32.269 --> 15:35.040
I'll just tell them
something else, uh...

15:36.740 --> 15:38.210
-[machine beeping]
-Oh.

15:38.309 --> 15:40.545
I will tell them that I joined
the traveling circus.

15:42.647 --> 15:43.615
Quite.

15:52.323 --> 15:53.758
I understand
that you're a renowned

15:53.858 --> 15:55.094
linguist and anthropologist.

15:55.192 --> 15:56.328
Cambridge educated.

15:56.422 --> 15:57.129
Two PhD's.

15:57.227 --> 15:59.464
Oh, three PhD's actually.

15:59.563 --> 16:01.934
And I'm five credits away
from the Musical Theater Degree

16:02.032 --> 16:03.168
that I missed in college.

16:04.368 --> 16:06.171
As impressive as that may be,

16:06.269 --> 16:08.908
I fear that none of it
will have adequately
prepared you for this.

16:09.005 --> 16:12.044
A little over a year ago,
the Ant Farm R and D department

16:12.137 --> 16:14.146
conceived of a creature
that could be bred,

16:14.245 --> 16:15.647
-as a weaponized
force of nature.
-[keypad beeping]

16:15.746 --> 16:17.516
The goal was to make
them unstoppable.

16:17.616 --> 16:18.283
[door opens]

16:18.382 --> 16:21.286
Let me guess, it worked.

16:22.219 --> 16:23.355
All too well.

16:26.890 --> 16:29.461
Your mission is to establish
a means of communication,

16:29.559 --> 16:32.264
and through which assert
control and order.

16:33.131 --> 16:35.968
Weapons must obey our command.

16:36.067 --> 16:40.205

-[objects clattering]

16:46.044 --> 16:47.179
They're beautiful.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.625
All right, Cyborg.

17:00.724 --> 17:04.663
Um, let's see what you can do
with the old-fashioned way.

17:37.594 --> 17:38.830
[Larry]
I know you're scared.

17:40.098 --> 17:41.300
I can sense it.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.236
Just-- [sighs]

17:44.334 --> 17:46.605
You have to trust me
that I'm gonna make
everything all right.

17:47.972 --> 17:49.374
[sighs]

17:49.473 --> 17:51.276
Once we avert the apocalypse,

17:51.375 --> 17:53.445
everything will
go back to normal.

17:53.544 --> 17:56.215
You have to keep
trusting me, all right?

17:56.313 --> 17:59.318
-We have to stick-- [grunts]
-[energy surging]

17:59.984 --> 18:01.486
Keeg?

18:01.585 --> 18:03.788
I said we have
to stick together.

18:05.422 --> 18:07.292
Why are you acting like this?

18:08.492 --> 18:10.329
What did Future Keeg
say to you?

18:11.529 --> 18:13.365
Oh, let me guess,
whatever it was,

18:13.464 --> 18:16.335
it was all my fault, wasn't it?

18:16.433 --> 18:18.170
Well, we're not
in the future anymore

18:18.269 --> 18:19.905
and I'm still in charge.

18:20.003 --> 18:22.241
If we wanna fix this
we have to stay uni--

18:22.340 --> 18:24.476
-[warbles]
-Damn it.

18:27.011 --> 18:28.380
There you are. Judas!

18:28.478 --> 18:30.382
I'm a little busy
right now, Rita.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.685
[scoffs] Don't you walk
away from me!

18:33.785 --> 18:34.619
[Larry] Keeg!

Fucking puzzles.

19:05.149 --> 19:06.318

19:07.018 --> 19:08.387
Fucking puzzles.

19:20.131 --> 19:21.733
There are no edge pieces.

19:23.101 --> 19:24.869
There are no corner pieces.

19:31.876 --> 19:33.745
There are no edge pieces.

19:35.146 --> 19:36.315
What?

19:36.413 --> 19:37.616
And they all look the same.

19:42.452 --> 19:45.324
Come on,
you piece of shit piece.

20:05.977 --> 20:07.446
They fucking left.

20:07.545 --> 20:10.182
Rouge and Cliff, they went
on the mission without us.

20:10.281 --> 20:11.650
Are you fucking kidding?

20:11.749 --> 20:13.452
What's with everyone
ditching me lately?

20:13.550 --> 20:15.320
Did someone send out a memo?

20:15.419 --> 20:16.655
Welcome to the club.

20:18.155 --> 20:19.358
Well, where are you going?

20:21.659 --> 20:23.262
[sighs]

20:23.359 --> 20:25.931
I intercepted
a transmission report
from the Bureau of Normalcy.

20:26.030 --> 20:27.699
There's another
Zombie Butt out there.

20:27.798 --> 20:29.634
If I hurry,
I can still intercept it.

20:30.734 --> 20:32.571
So, you're leaving us too?

20:33.838 --> 20:35.440
[sighs] Jane...

20:37.006 --> 20:39.578
would you like to join me
on a mission to save the world?

20:40.812 --> 20:41.846
Hmm...

20:43.242 --> 20:44.984
Yeah, fuck it.
Sure, yeah.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.219
Wait, wait, wait,
what about Rita and Larry?

20:47.318 --> 20:48.387

-[Rita] Larry!
-[Larry] Rita!

20:51.555 --> 20:53.358
-[Rita] What?
-[Larry] Have you seen Keeg?

20:53.458 --> 20:54.526
[Rita] Larry!

20:54.625 --> 20:55.928
It's now or never.
You ready?

20:56.026 --> 20:56.996
Let's go, yeah.

20:57.929 --> 20:58.763

[panting]

21:13.811 --> 21:15.647
Speak for yourself, big man.

21:18.915 --> 21:21.386
[Cliff] I told you, you could
sit on my handle bars.

21:21.485 --> 21:22.621
-[bicycle rattles]
-Whoa-oh.

21:22.719 --> 21:24.423
Then I said
I would rather die!

21:25.056 --> 21:25.890
[Cliff] Hmm.

21:27.792 --> 21:29.328
[cheerful music continues]

21:33.063 --> 21:34.599
[Cliff] Ooh! Wow!

21:42.073 --> 21:44.843
What the fuck is that?

21:48.412 --> 21:51.650
This is a fucking crime!

21:51.748 --> 21:53.785
[clicks tongue]
Yeah, litter is a crime.

21:54.652 --> 21:55.921
[Cliff] Littering?

21:56.015 --> 21:56.989
That thing isn't trash.

21:57.088 --> 22:00.392
That's a 1974 Gran Torino.

22:00.491 --> 22:01.961
It's one of the first
cars I bought

22:02.060 --> 22:03.895
when I made it big
on the circuit.

22:03.995 --> 22:06.731
I used to fix up cars
with my dad.

22:06.831 --> 22:09.034
Way older than the model '78.

22:09.133 --> 22:10.369
[chuckles] Fuck.

22:10.468 --> 22:12.637
Fixing cars was probably
the only thing

22:12.737 --> 22:14.239
my dad was good at.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.241
'Cause when
you're fixing the car,

22:16.340 --> 22:17.776
everything makes sense.

22:17.875 --> 22:20.980
There's a solution
to every problem.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.581
We both understood that.

22:23.548 --> 22:24.984
You just...

22:25.082 --> 22:26.085
lose yourself in it.

22:27.384 --> 22:29.254
It's tactile.

22:29.353 --> 22:30.789
Well, what are you waiting for?

22:30.887 --> 22:33.158
Why don't you "pop the hood,"
as they say?

22:33.257 --> 22:36.895
You know, let yourself feel
that sensation again.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.998
[Cliff] No, no. Not yet.

22:39.096 --> 22:41.901
I'm saving my first touch
for my family.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.168
End of discussion.

22:43.267 --> 22:44.636
Save the world,

22:44.735 --> 22:46.638
then allow myself
to feel again.

22:47.804 --> 22:49.008
Anything else would be a waste.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.276
Well, that's very noble.

22:51.375 --> 22:53.012
[Cliff] Yeah, well...

22:53.110 --> 22:56.781
You're lucky that you have
people to share your life with.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.019
I don't know
where I was in the future
or what happened.

23:00.117 --> 23:04.523
But I'm certain of one thing,
I was alone.

23:04.622 --> 23:07.159
You know,
we are quite a bit alike,

we may never truly find.

Wha... What the fuck
are you talking about?

23:24.174 --> 23:28.113
[clicks tongue]
Uh, the, um, the car.

23:28.212 --> 23:32.117
Yeah, I thought you were using
the car as a metaphor.

23:33.050 --> 23:33.685
Metaphor?

23:33.785 --> 23:34.987
A metaphor for what?

23:35.086 --> 23:36.488
It's a fucking car.

Yeah. I... I know it's a--

Uh, wh... what,
what are we looking at here?

24:42.019 --> 24:42.988
Their butts.

24:43.087 --> 24:45.390
Now, General,
you and I both know

24:45.489 --> 24:46.758
they are so much
more than that.

24:46.857 --> 24:48.527
You're the visionary
behind this project.

24:48.626 --> 24:50.062
These aren't just Butts,

24:50.160 --> 24:52.731
they're an entirely
new species of creature

24:52.829 --> 24:55.600
that we categorized
as Gluteus Morticus.

24:55.699 --> 24:57.702
Infinitely complex,
highly intelligent

24:57.801 --> 24:59.905
with deeply engrained
social dynamics.

25:00.003 --> 25:02.607
Take these two specimens
in front for example.

25:02.706 --> 25:05.044
Note, the scarring
on their forequarters.

25:05.143 --> 25:06.912
They were born
as conjoined twins.

25:07.011 --> 25:08.747
They're brothers
and they recognize that.

25:08.840 --> 25:13.018
In fact, I've only just started
to comprehend their bond.

25:13.117 --> 25:14.753
One of them,
I've named Nicholas,

25:14.852 --> 25:16.255
and the other
I've named Theodore.

25:16.353 --> 25:17.856
Teddy. [chuckles]

25:17.955 --> 25:20.092
As you can see,
they're not killing machines.

25:20.190 --> 25:22.561
They're quite gentle,
they have a love of music--

25:22.661 --> 25:24.629
Bored!

25:24.728 --> 25:26.131
-[music stops]
-No, don't!

25:29.133 --> 25:31.470
[Butts growling]

25:31.570 --> 25:32.938
[all exclaiming]

25:33.037 --> 25:34.239
[yelps] They're upset with me.

25:34.338 --> 25:36.008
The Butts have gotten
upset with me.

25:36.106 --> 25:37.676
[thudding]

25:37.775 --> 25:38.978
Close it, close it!

25:39.076 --> 25:41.446
The Butts have gotten
upset with me.

25:41.546 --> 25:42.814
You scared him.

25:42.913 --> 25:45.284
Your Butts have gone nuts.
...upset with me.

25:45.383 --> 25:46.818
General, say it.

25:46.917 --> 25:49.549
[both] We mustn't
upset the Butts.

25:49.653 --> 25:51.690
-[shudders]
-That's right.

25:51.790 --> 25:54.526
Okay, we're outta here.

25:54.624 --> 25:56.628
You must see
what you have here.

25:56.726 --> 26:00.399
This is an apex life form
capable of... of coexisting
with humankind!

26:00.497 --> 26:04.970
Yes, and the bureau
is grateful for all your work.

26:05.069 --> 26:07.772
Your methods may
have been unorthodox

26:07.871 --> 26:11.510
but this project should be
considered a great success
for our country.

26:11.608 --> 26:13.278
Finally,
we have what we need

26:13.377 --> 26:16.748
to move forward
with weaponization.

26:16.847 --> 26:19.451
Wait, you can't seriously
still be considering

26:19.549 --> 26:20.852
weaponizing these creatures.

26:20.951 --> 26:22.988
Please, you'd be weaponizing

26:23.087 --> 26:25.157
one of the greatest discoveries
of our time.

26:26.123 --> 26:27.026
Great discovery?

26:28.092 --> 26:29.028
Like what?

26:30.094 --> 26:31.330
Fire?

26:31.428 --> 26:34.099
Electricity? The atom?

26:34.198 --> 26:38.203
Weaponization is the fruit
of progress, Dr. Yu.

26:38.302 --> 26:41.706
This is the intention
of discovery always.

26:42.940 --> 26:44.604
Give me three days.

26:44.709 --> 26:46.078
I will change your mind.

26:46.177 --> 26:47.679
I will put together
the greatest talent show--

26:47.778 --> 26:49.414
You'll be reassigned.

26:49.514 --> 26:51.183
Immediately.

26:51.282 --> 26:54.319
-I--
-And if you continue
this foolish crusade,

26:54.418 --> 26:56.821
you'll be demoted, or worse.

26:58.956 --> 27:00.492
Are you threatening me?

27:00.590 --> 27:03.362
You're the linguist, Doctor,
figure it out for yourself.

27:04.328 --> 27:05.364
[door closes]

27:05.463 --> 27:08.000
[scoffs]

27:08.097 --> 27:10.569
[Larry] Keeg, I know you love
to hide in electric wiring

27:10.668 --> 27:12.337
but now is not the time.

27:12.436 --> 27:14.673
We don't wanna risk everything
we're building together

27:14.772 --> 27:16.408
on a game of hide-and-seek.

27:18.042 --> 27:20.379
Oh, damn it, Keeg, talk to me.

27:21.978 --> 27:24.984
I'm done talking
to flowers and floor lamps.

27:25.083 --> 27:25.951
Oh, shit.

27:26.050 --> 27:28.753
I'm sorry. Did I surprise you?

27:28.853 --> 27:30.055
That must be frustrating

27:30.154 --> 27:31.356
when someone
you love and trust

27:31.455 --> 27:33.392
does something
completely unexpected.

27:33.490 --> 27:34.693
[Larry] As I said, Rita,

27:34.791 --> 27:35.961
I'm a bit preoccupied
at the moment.

27:36.060 --> 27:37.963
So, that's how
you're going to play it?

27:38.062 --> 27:40.399
Feigning more concern
for that thing

27:40.497 --> 27:42.001
than you have for me?

27:42.099 --> 27:43.635
Well, the least
you could've done

27:43.733 --> 27:46.471
was look me in the eyes
before stabbing me in the back.

27:46.570 --> 27:47.706
Honestly, that's probably why

27:47.804 --> 27:49.574
Keeg wants nothing
to do with you

27:49.673 --> 27:52.711
now that he's seen the way
you treat those
you care most about.

27:52.810 --> 27:54.914
The ones who love you enough

27:55.013 --> 27:57.677
to ignore
the bandage body odor.

27:58.782 --> 27:59.985
Oh, for heaven's sake, Larry,

28:00.084 --> 28:01.420
just cut the power
to the house.

28:01.518 --> 28:03.088
-[electricity crackles]
-[Larry yelps] God!

28:03.187 --> 28:06.625
-[Larry sighs]
-Looks like Rita
was right again.

28:06.723 --> 28:08.127
[Larry] All right,
you know what?

28:08.225 --> 28:09.328
Enough.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.663
You act like this was some
great betrayal,

28:11.762 --> 28:13.365
but I had my reasons.

28:13.463 --> 28:14.766
And even if I didn't,

28:14.865 --> 28:16.768
you were actually
a pretty shitty team leader.

28:16.867 --> 28:18.803
All you did was tell everyone
what to do.

28:18.903 --> 28:20.772
Holding us
to impossible standards,

28:20.871 --> 28:23.075
giving out gold stars
and demerits

28:23.174 --> 28:25.344
like we were all
little school children.

28:25.443 --> 28:27.179
After a while,

28:27.271 --> 28:28.813
it didn't even feel like
we were doing good
for the right reasons.

28:28.913 --> 28:30.950
We were just
going through the motions

28:31.049 --> 28:33.318
as part of a misguided
vanity play.

28:33.951 --> 28:35.287
[Rita scoffs]

28:35.385 --> 28:38.857
[Larry] And as for my reasons,
I saw the future.

28:38.956 --> 28:41.026
We all saw where we end up.

28:41.125 --> 28:43.295
Excuse me for trying
to avoid that fate.

28:46.130 --> 28:47.799
I would've thought
of all people,

28:47.898 --> 28:51.603
you'd understand
how time travel
can change one's priorities.

28:51.696 --> 28:53.172
When you came back
from the past,

28:53.271 --> 28:54.439
you were broken.

28:55.773 --> 28:57.176
You called us all strangers,

28:57.274 --> 28:58.877
and you haven't
made me feel like

28:58.975 --> 29:01.513
anything other
than a stranger ever since.

29:03.114 --> 29:04.316
[smacks lips] So, what then?

29:04.415 --> 29:08.020
You think your future
was my fault?

29:08.119 --> 29:10.089
[electricity crackling]

29:10.755 --> 29:11.991
[Larry sighs]

29:14.558 --> 29:17.529
[Larry] No. I saw Keeg
separated from me.

29:17.628 --> 29:18.964
Abandoned.

29:19.063 --> 29:20.900
Now he wants
nothing to do with me.

29:20.998 --> 29:22.401
It wasn't your fault.

29:22.499 --> 29:25.070
If anyone was to blame
it was probably me.

29:25.168 --> 29:27.406
But I'll do whatever I can
to keep that from happening.

29:27.505 --> 29:30.142
And if that means Rouge
takes charge of the team,

29:30.241 --> 29:31.310
so be it.

29:32.543 --> 29:36.215
I'm sorry, Rita,
but I have to do this.

29:37.815 --> 29:39.318
Keeg is all I have left.

29:41.585 --> 29:42.922
All you have left?

29:45.356 --> 29:48.093
Being team leader
was all I had left.

29:48.192 --> 29:50.895
And now thanks to you,
I have nothing.

29:53.864 --> 29:54.900
[Larry sighs]

30:01.004 --> 30:03.008
[Jane] You're fucking
kidding me.

30:03.107 --> 30:05.610
We're supposed to be posing
as bureau agents?

30:05.709 --> 30:09.014
You could've at least told me
to change my fucking shirt.

30:09.113 --> 30:11.650
I told him
we'd be undercover.

30:11.749 --> 30:12.812
Oh, boy.

30:15.286 --> 30:17.389
Okay, so,
what's your idea exactly?

30:21.925 --> 30:24.596
Darren Jones
isn't the only Zombie Butt?

30:24.696 --> 30:26.565
I'm not sure.

30:26.664 --> 30:28.767
But if another Zombie Butt
escaped that night,

30:28.866 --> 30:31.336
then the Bureau of Normalcy
is gonna know about it.

30:32.770 --> 30:33.872
Okay, and this...

30:33.971 --> 30:35.440
And if this works,
wha... what,

30:35.539 --> 30:38.510
you'll finally be voted
as team leader?

30:39.878 --> 30:41.046
-[scoffs]
-I think the team

30:41.145 --> 30:42.447
made it pretty clear
how they feel

30:42.546 --> 30:44.716
about me being team leader,
several times.

30:44.816 --> 30:46.451
Then, why are you acting

30:46.550 --> 30:49.621
like such a lame-ass
motivational poster
come to life?

30:49.721 --> 30:50.956
I mean, seriously,

30:51.055 --> 30:52.791
you're like
a energy drink commercial.

30:52.891 --> 30:54.059
Why are you so fucking tense?

30:54.158 --> 30:56.895
Because I saw
the same future you saw.

30:59.296 --> 31:00.232
I'm...

31:01.599 --> 31:03.568
I'm trying to save
the world right now,

31:03.668 --> 31:05.204
and maybe if we can do that,

31:05.303 --> 31:07.239
then I can finally
move on with my life.

31:09.739 --> 31:13.112
Okay, so you're gonna
save the world. Then what?

31:13.211 --> 31:17.249
You're gonna go off backpacking
with a bunch of normies?

31:17.348 --> 31:20.285
Join an ultimate
frisbee league, dude?

31:22.754 --> 31:25.190
Wow. I'm right, aren't I?

31:25.289 --> 31:28.793
Damn, everyone's just going off
on a solo act these days.

31:28.893 --> 31:30.795
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.232
Yeah, well,
it's easy to feel like

31:33.331 --> 31:35.067
everyone else
is moving on without you

31:35.166 --> 31:37.202
if you're stuck standing still.

31:40.904 --> 31:44.843
[clicks tongue] Okay, so let...
let's say you save the world,

31:44.942 --> 31:46.778
then what happens tomorrow?

31:46.878 --> 31:48.813
I don't know. Wednesday?

31:48.913 --> 31:50.849
Come on.

31:50.948 --> 31:52.517
You've been here
long enough to know

31:52.616 --> 31:56.621
that our world is ending
like every other fucking day.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.723
You keep telling yourself
that you're gonna move on,

31:58.822 --> 32:01.526
but it feels like you keep
finding reasons to stay.

32:02.494 --> 32:03.795
[scoffs]

32:03.894 --> 32:06.531
I never said I was quitting.

32:06.630 --> 32:08.400
I just need
some time to myself.

32:08.499 --> 32:10.269
I've wanted that
for a long time.

32:11.769 --> 32:13.105
[inhales sharply]

32:13.203 --> 32:14.339
Yeah, it must be nice
to know what you want.

32:14.434 --> 32:15.540
[Jane sighs]

32:18.075 --> 32:19.578
Have you talked to Kay lately?

32:19.677 --> 32:20.579
No.

32:22.146 --> 32:24.716
Well, there was like a moment.

32:24.814 --> 32:27.319
[clicks tongue] I mean,
what the fuck
do you know about it?

32:28.152 --> 32:29.221
I was just thinking,

32:30.254 --> 32:31.656
maybe what Kay
wants for you

32:31.755 --> 32:33.658
is different to what
Kay wants for herself.

32:34.825 --> 32:35.794
The fuck is that
supposed to mean?

32:35.893 --> 32:37.029
You don't even know Kay.

32:37.127 --> 32:38.630
No, Kay was up top
a few months ago.

32:38.730 --> 32:40.065
All of us met her.

32:43.034 --> 32:44.436
I didn't wanna
bother you about it.

32:45.336 --> 32:47.006
Bother me about what?

32:48.305 --> 32:50.309
Kay had your recorded
interview with her,

32:50.407 --> 32:51.543
-like Niles used to do.
-[cell phone vibrating]

32:51.641 --> 32:53.378
[whispering]
Tell me everything.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.682
-It's him.
-Okay.

33:01.586 --> 33:02.955
[birds chirping]

33:03.054 --> 33:04.423
[Cliff] So, what?

33:04.522 --> 33:06.391
We just wait for him in a barn
and ambush him?

33:08.192 --> 33:10.129
Yeah, is that
too complicated?

33:10.227 --> 33:11.530
[Cliff] Won't he
smell us coming?

33:12.730 --> 33:14.566
Well, the last time,
your pal, Kipling,

33:14.665 --> 33:18.570
had a magic hat laced
with secret pine air freshener.

33:18.670 --> 33:19.804
But in lieu of that,

33:19.903 --> 33:22.174
I've improvised
and I've doused our helmets

33:22.272 --> 33:24.243
with Niles's old cologne.

33:25.977 --> 33:26.811
[Cliff] And that'll work?

33:26.911 --> 33:27.913
[thudding]

33:28.012 --> 33:29.514
It better.

33:29.609 --> 33:31.316
[Darren whistling]

33:40.725 --> 33:42.727
Hello, Darren.

33:42.826 --> 33:46.131
[Cliff] Get ready to kiss
the cook, motherfucker.

33:46.230 --> 33:47.666
[growling]

33:56.273 --> 33:57.409
[Cliff] Holy shit!

33:57.507 --> 33:59.278
I still understand
zombie speak.

33:59.376 --> 34:00.612
Who... Uh, what's he saying?

34:00.711 --> 34:02.781
[Cliff] He said,
"Welcome to my farm."

34:02.879 --> 34:04.749
-[Madame Rouge] Hmm?
-[Cliff] Fuck the farm!

34:04.848 --> 34:08.120
Listen, Darren,
here's what's gonna happen.

34:08.219 --> 34:10.322
I'm gonna save
the fucking world

34:10.421 --> 34:13.592
by crushing
your dumb zombie face.

34:13.691 --> 34:16.795
[growls]

34:16.894 --> 34:18.163
What's he saying now?

34:18.262 --> 34:23.268
[growling]

34:32.776 --> 34:34.513
[Cliff] He says
he won't eat brains,

34:34.612 --> 34:36.881
he's refusing to be a zombie.

34:36.980 --> 34:39.351
Well... [sputters]
I don't think you can do that.

34:39.450 --> 34:41.286
Can you do that?
I don't think you can do that.

34:41.385 --> 34:42.554
[Cliff] I don't know.
He's still talking.

34:42.648 --> 34:43.288
[Cliff shushes]

34:43.387 --> 34:45.524
[growling continues]

34:47.225 --> 34:49.194
[Cliff] Uh, something
about tomatoes?

34:49.293 --> 34:52.397
[growling continues]

34:56.766 --> 34:58.203
[Cliff] I think
he's wrappin' it up.

34:58.302 --> 35:01.506
-Okay, good, good
-[growling]

35:03.708 --> 35:05.410
What's he doing?

35:06.511 --> 35:07.746
[growls]

35:09.781 --> 35:10.749
[Cliff] What the fuck?

35:10.848 --> 35:12.451
[growls]

35:12.549 --> 35:14.453
[Cliff] Fuck off, Darren.

35:14.552 --> 35:16.555
I came here to fight you
and save the world,

35:16.653 --> 35:19.658
not commit some kind of
weird mercy killing.

35:19.757 --> 35:21.793
What's wrong?

35:21.892 --> 35:23.762
[Cliff] He's asking me
to put him down!

35:23.860 --> 35:25.664
Oh, and what is wrong
with that?

35:27.231 --> 35:28.800
[Cliff] He's a fucking zombie!

35:28.899 --> 35:30.169
-You're not Old fucking Yeller.
-[Darren growling]

35:30.267 --> 35:33.238
[continues growling]

35:40.278 --> 35:41.380
[Cliff] Hey, hold on.

35:41.478 --> 35:42.581
I don't know
if I can just kill

35:42.679 --> 35:44.749
an unarmed
Zombie Butt farmer.

35:44.848 --> 35:47.052
Stop messing
with my head, Darren.

35:47.151 --> 35:48.553
-Stop trying to make...
-[grunts]

35:48.652 --> 35:50.222
...this... this easy on me.

35:52.056 --> 35:53.358
[sniffs]

35:53.457 --> 35:55.260
-[growls]
-[Cliff] The fuck
are you doing?

35:55.359 --> 35:56.495
What needs to be done.

35:57.662 --> 36:00.399
[growling]

36:00.498 --> 36:02.267
[Cliff] Oh, no. Oh, no.

36:02.366 --> 36:04.904
[growling continues]

36:05.002 --> 36:07.639
[Cliff screams] Holy!

36:08.272 --> 36:10.709
[both grunting]

36:12.276 --> 36:13.245
[growls]

36:13.344 --> 36:14.980
[Cliff] You're fucking crazy!

36:15.079 --> 36:16.848
[growling]

36:16.948 --> 36:17.849
[Cliff grunts]

36:20.584 --> 36:23.155
All right, Darren!
You asked for it.

36:23.254 --> 36:24.756
[choking]

36:24.856 --> 36:26.458
[Cliff grunting]

36:27.357 --> 36:28.460
[blood splatters]

36:28.559 --> 36:30.695
[ominous music playing]

36:30.795 --> 36:31.696
Weapon.

36:34.765 --> 36:36.468
-[Cliff grunts]
-[flesh squelches]

36:37.902 --> 36:39.771
[pants]

36:44.008 --> 36:45.610
[sniffles] Cliff.

36:46.377 --> 36:48.180
Cliff, it's... it's over.

36:48.278 --> 36:49.314
It's done.

36:50.881 --> 36:52.384
[Cliff breathes shakily]

36:52.483 --> 36:54.053
I did it. It's over.

36:54.151 --> 36:56.255
[breathing heavily]

36:59.656 --> 37:02.127
Something's...
[breathing heavily]

37:02.226 --> 37:03.963
Something's cold.

37:05.896 --> 37:08.533
Oh, no. Oh, God, no.

37:09.266 --> 37:10.903
Oh, God! No!

37:11.001 --> 37:13.038
No! No, no, no!

37:13.136 --> 37:15.540
-I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Cliff.
-[Cliff breathing heavily]

37:16.873 --> 37:18.810
You said you needed
a reason to fight, I--

37:18.910 --> 37:20.412
[Cliff] You did
the right thing.

37:21.612 --> 37:23.748
I hesitated
and you got it done.

37:25.149 --> 37:27.119
That's why
you're the leader.

37:27.218 --> 37:28.287
Where the fuck's my...

37:28.386 --> 37:29.554
[grunts]

37:32.256 --> 37:33.858
[breathing heavily] Shit.

37:35.392 --> 37:37.096
[Cliff sighs]

37:37.195 --> 37:38.730
Well, what are we waiting for?

37:40.564 --> 37:41.866
We saved the world.

37:43.062 --> 37:44.536
Let's fucking go home.

37:50.241 --> 37:51.610
Right.

37:51.709 --> 37:54.546
[techno music playing]

38:09.226 --> 38:11.030
Agent Wolfmann, I presume.

38:11.128 --> 38:12.531
Correct.

38:12.630 --> 38:14.967
And this is my associate,
Agent Perez.

38:15.066 --> 38:17.736
[clicks tongue] Hey.
Sorry about my shirt.

38:17.836 --> 38:18.737
Laundry day.

38:21.004 --> 38:24.809
And you must be the,
uh... The Butt Hunter.

38:25.744 --> 38:26.946
[chomps]

38:27.044 --> 38:28.847
Why don't you
take a wild guess?

38:29.781 --> 38:30.782
Shit.

38:32.549 --> 38:35.754
[whispering] You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

38:35.852 --> 38:37.656
We don't wanna waste
any more of your time.

38:37.755 --> 38:39.319
We expect
a full mission report.

38:39.423 --> 38:44.296
You know I don't do those fancy
Bureau Normalcy protocols.

38:44.395 --> 38:45.764
Hunter's gotta have
his own code.

38:47.832 --> 38:48.667
Humor me.

38:49.834 --> 38:50.702
All right.

38:53.336 --> 38:57.209
A year ago the BON
lost an entire hoard
of killer Butts.

38:57.308 --> 39:00.545
Due to my specific skill set,
I was hired to round 'em up.

39:02.113 --> 39:03.248
Several confirmed dead,

39:03.347 --> 39:05.584
some by my hand,
some by others.

39:05.683 --> 39:07.852
But the majority
have been safely recovered.

39:09.386 --> 39:10.855
I always try to be humane
in my approach

39:10.954 --> 39:14.994
but, [chuckles] you know
how this business can be.

39:15.087 --> 39:16.828
The Butt hunting business?

39:16.922 --> 39:17.862
That's the one.

39:17.962 --> 39:19.698
What's the current
status report?

39:19.796 --> 39:22.701
Recently,
I came into possession
of the final target.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.836
It was particularly
difficult to track.

39:24.935 --> 39:26.638
These things are crafty,
you know.

39:26.737 --> 39:30.009
Butt hunting...
It's chess, it's not...

39:34.178 --> 39:35.280
Yahtzee.

39:35.379 --> 39:37.282
Why was it
difficult to track?

39:37.381 --> 39:38.717
Didn't behave like the others.

39:39.551 --> 39:40.752
Seemed sick.

39:41.719 --> 39:43.383
Infected, possibly.

39:43.487 --> 39:45.524
I put it on ice
to transport it.

39:45.622 --> 39:48.193
Cold seems to place it
in a vegetative state.

39:48.292 --> 39:50.562
But make no mistake,
this thing is not dead.

39:51.561 --> 39:53.598
Not all the way, anyway.

39:53.698 --> 39:54.967
So, it's a zombie.

39:55.066 --> 39:56.068
What's a zombie?

39:56.167 --> 39:57.802
Do you seriously not know
what a zombie is?

39:57.901 --> 40:00.105
I have a very
particular set of skills.

40:00.203 --> 40:02.874
-[softly] Okay.
-[Vic] Your information
tracks with our intel.

40:05.009 --> 40:06.645
Agent, um...

40:07.578 --> 40:08.480
[whispering] Butt Hunter.

40:08.580 --> 40:09.409
Butt Hunter.

40:09.513 --> 40:10.715
[whispers] Thank you.

40:10.814 --> 40:12.784
The bureau thanks you
for your work.

40:17.087 --> 40:19.691
-[whispering] Vic.
-[Vic] Yeah?

40:19.790 --> 40:21.994
[whispering] Where are
the real BON agents?

40:22.092 --> 40:23.028
[scoffs]

40:23.127 --> 40:24.796
I secretly moved up
the meeting.

40:24.896 --> 40:26.331
They're an hour behind us.

40:26.430 --> 40:29.568
Okay, but this Butt whacker
was like 45 minutes late.

40:30.601 --> 40:31.670
Now we gotta move.

40:39.677 --> 40:40.913
I'm assuming
you have my payment.

40:41.713 --> 40:42.915
It'll be wired to you.

40:43.014 --> 40:43.916
In Bitcoin.

40:47.051 --> 40:48.553
-[Jane chuckles]
-[Vic grunts]

40:48.653 --> 40:49.955
-Thanks.
-[Vic] Yeah.

40:55.059 --> 40:58.230
And this
is the final Butt, right?

40:58.328 --> 40:59.831
Who's the Butt hunter here?

40:59.925 --> 41:01.233
Me or you?

41:01.332 --> 41:02.902
And none of the other Butts
had any signs of sickness,

41:02.995 --> 41:04.236
only this one?

41:05.336 --> 41:06.705
Adios, amigo.

41:09.106 --> 41:09.874
Don't let 'em hit ya

41:09.974 --> 41:11.610
where the good Lord splits ya.

41:15.812 --> 41:17.917
[breathing heavily]
Really missing your cyborg tech

41:18.015 --> 41:22.454
right about now,
fucking Agent... Wolfmann.

41:22.552 --> 41:24.356
Now, what's your
super power again, Jane,

41:24.455 --> 41:25.424
besides complaining?

41:25.522 --> 41:26.791
[Jane breathing heavily]

41:26.890 --> 41:28.360
Flit, I know I never
ask you for anything

41:28.458 --> 41:29.594
but please don't fuck me.

41:29.694 --> 41:30.963
[car doors open]

41:42.272 --> 41:44.109
[operatic music playing
over headphones]

41:48.745 --> 41:51.750
[man over pa system]
Attention, the Butts are loose.

42:00.959 --> 42:02.727
Attention, the Butts are loose.

42:02.827 --> 42:04.896
[Cliff yells] Fuck!

42:05.529 --> 42:07.099
What the fuck?

42:07.198 --> 42:08.067
Oh, fuck!

42:08.166 --> 42:09.034
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

42:10.800 --> 42:13.305
[man over pa system]
Attention, the Butts are loose.

42:13.403 --> 42:14.773
[alarm blaring]

42:14.871 --> 42:16.536
What the hell
are you still doing here?

42:16.640 --> 42:19.644
We have to get
above ground before
the exterminators arrive.

42:20.678 --> 42:21.580
Exterminators?

42:21.679 --> 42:24.183
[alarm blaring]

42:24.281 --> 42:27.186
[man over pa system]
Attention, the Butts are loose.

42:27.285 --> 42:29.221
[metal creaking]

42:33.424 --> 42:35.894
[eerie music playing]

42:49.708 --> 42:50.742
[whispering] Nicholas?

42:59.751 --> 43:01.353
[footsteps approaching]

43:14.698 --> 43:17.402
Any luck with your friend?

43:17.501 --> 43:20.600
[electricity crackling]

43:20.704 --> 43:22.174
[Larry] Does that answer
your question?

43:23.940 --> 43:27.212
[Cliff] Daddy's home,
shitlickers!

43:27.311 --> 43:28.580
'Tis done.

43:28.679 --> 43:30.782
Cliff and I found Darren Jones
and we kicked his ass.

43:30.882 --> 43:32.117
[Cliff chuckles]

43:32.216 --> 43:33.585
The fucker didn't even
put up a fight.

43:33.685 --> 43:35.354
[Larry] Congratulations.

43:41.858 --> 43:44.696
Okay, uh, why...
why y'all acting so sore?

43:44.794 --> 43:46.265
We did it.
Mission accomplished.

43:46.363 --> 43:47.432
The world is saved.

43:47.532 --> 43:48.800
Not yet, it isn't.

43:49.768 --> 43:50.802
[Jane] No.

43:54.739 --> 43:56.636
[box thudding]

43:57.842 --> 43:59.311
After you two went AWOL,

43:59.410 --> 44:00.913
I hacked into
the bureau's records.

44:01.012 --> 44:02.681
Now there was a second
Zombie Butt

44:02.779 --> 44:04.416
that none of us
had even considered.

44:04.516 --> 44:05.517
[Jane] Yeah.

44:05.617 --> 44:06.818
We went undercover

44:06.917 --> 44:08.787
and just stole it
right from under them.

44:08.887 --> 44:10.222
Thanks for the invite, though.

44:10.321 --> 44:11.756
Excellent work, you two.

44:11.856 --> 44:13.592
You see, this is what happens

44:13.685 --> 44:15.494
when this team
is given the autonomy

44:15.587 --> 44:17.657
to make decisions
for themselves.

44:17.762 --> 44:19.098
You know what?

44:19.196 --> 44:21.533
We all deserve a gold star.

44:21.632 --> 44:24.369
I didn't do this
for a gold star.

44:24.468 --> 44:25.870
Eh, whatever,
mission accomplished.

44:25.970 --> 44:28.107
This is the final Zombie Butt.

44:32.276 --> 44:33.812
I'm sure you two
can handle it.

44:36.781 --> 44:37.917
So, Cliff, uh,

44:38.015 --> 44:40.319
can you dispose off
the second Butt?

44:40.417 --> 44:42.854
[Cliff] Me? Kill it?

44:42.954 --> 44:44.823
-With pleasure.
-Okay, great.

44:50.962 --> 44:52.431
Let's see what we got here.

44:52.530 --> 44:53.365
[sighs]

45:02.206 --> 45:05.844
Oh, I'm sorry,
little guy.

45:13.350 --> 45:14.286
Just need a minute.

45:20.457 --> 45:21.994
I felt something today.

45:23.828 --> 45:25.264
Really felt something.

45:25.363 --> 45:26.331
I swear.

45:26.430 --> 45:27.967
For the first time
in a long time.

45:29.699 --> 45:31.770
I always thought if I ever
got a chance to feel again,

45:31.868 --> 45:33.733
it'd be my daughter's
hand in mine.

45:33.838 --> 45:35.240
Maybe my grandson in my arms

45:35.339 --> 45:37.309
while I help him
with his hiccups.

45:37.408 --> 45:38.610
That would've been nice.

45:38.709 --> 45:39.778
Instead,

45:39.877 --> 45:41.313
I felt someone's
skull collapse

45:41.411 --> 45:43.215
under my palm
like a grapefruit.

45:43.308 --> 45:44.783
The tough skin,

45:45.783 --> 45:47.352
messy insides.

45:48.619 --> 45:50.422
I felt it all.

45:50.521 --> 45:51.751
The blood was cold.

45:52.924 --> 45:55.060
I guess he was dead already,

45:55.860 --> 45:57.062
sort of.

45:59.030 --> 46:00.299
His eyes...

46:02.766 --> 46:06.238
It felt like there was still
warmth in his eyes.

46:08.006 --> 46:10.475
[rattling]

46:14.111 --> 46:15.514
I just... I need a minute.

46:15.613 --> 46:16.448
[sighs]

46:18.715 --> 46:20.385
[pensive music playing]

46:56.754 --> 46:58.057
[sighs]

47:02.560 --> 47:05.030
[beeping]

47:05.129 --> 47:06.531
[cell phone vibrating]

47:32.689 --> 47:34.927
[Vic on recording]
What would you
like to talk about?

47:35.759 --> 47:36.929
[Kay] I've been thinking,

47:37.995 --> 47:40.432
well, more like wondering.

47:40.531 --> 47:43.068
What is the underground
supposed to be?

47:43.868 --> 47:45.137
What it's for?

47:45.236 --> 47:46.638
[Vic] You mean
like its purpose?

[Kay] Yes! Its purpose.

47:48.772 --> 47:51.210
What is the purpose
of the underground?

47:51.308 --> 47:52.912
All of the different personas.

47:53.010 --> 47:54.279
I used to know,

47:54.378 --> 47:56.615
all of the personas
always said

47:56.714 --> 47:57.917
they had one purpose,

47:58.749 --> 47:59.985
to protect me.

48:00.084 --> 48:01.353
[Vic] And they do,
don't they?

48:04.989 --> 48:06.058
[Kay] Maybe.

48:06.157 --> 48:07.359
I don't know.

48:08.126 --> 48:09.794
Something's changed.

48:09.893 --> 48:12.998
I don't think I need them
to have that purpose anymore.

48:13.097 --> 48:15.234
I think they need
a new purpose.

48:15.332 --> 48:17.236
Otherwise,
they'll all be lost.

48:17.335 --> 48:19.104
[Vic] What do you mean
they'll be lost?

48:19.203 --> 48:20.339
I don't know.

48:22.306 --> 48:24.676
I think they need to figure
that out for themselves.

48:25.943 --> 48:27.846
[Jane] A new purpose?

48:27.945 --> 48:30.349
The fuck is my purpose,
if it's not to protect you?

48:30.447 --> 48:33.085
[Vic] Does Jane
know her purpose?

48:33.184 --> 48:34.586
She takes care of me.

48:36.553 --> 48:40.125
She still thinks her purpose
is to protect me.

48:41.754 --> 48:43.228
She's feeling lost.

48:44.395 --> 48:45.998
But she'll be all right.

48:46.096 --> 48:49.101
If anybody can put the pieces
together, it's Jane.
