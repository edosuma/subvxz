00:36.069 --> 00:39.105
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
KILLERS CAN BE KILLED ?

00:39.172 --> 00:40.473
AND IF WE KILL THEM,

00:40.540 --> 00:43.376
DO WE ADD TO OR REDUCE
THE EVIL IN THE WORLD ?

00:43.443 --> 00:46.079
I'M TODD McFARLANE,
CREATOR OF "SPAWN".

00:46.146 --> 00:48.715
CAN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION
I'VE JUST ASKED ?

00:48.782 --> 00:50.250
SPAWN HAS TO.

00:50.316 --> 00:52.352
BECAUSE YOU'LL SEE IT'S
TIME FOR A SHOWDOWN

00:52.419 --> 00:54.687
AND SPAWN STILL HAS
SOME BIG CHOICES TO MAKE.

00:54.754 --> 00:56.189
IF HE DECIDES RIGHT,

00:56.256 --> 00:58.024
THE BATTLE GOES
TO THE GOOD GUYS.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.259
MAYBE.

00:59.325 --> 01:00.827
IF HE DECIDES WRONG,

01:00.894 --> 01:03.363
WELL, YOU KNOW THE ANSWER
TO THAT, DON'T YOU ?

01:03.430 --> 01:05.098

FOR SOME KIND OF
WACKED-OUT STREET PREACHER.

01:15.475 --> 01:18.077
BUT I NEVER SAID I WAS
GONNA KILL ANYBODY.

01:20.947 --> 01:22.215
THIS SO-CALLED
PREACHER

01:22.282 --> 01:24.250
MIGHT BE OUR
CHILD KILLER.

01:24.317 --> 01:25.852

VEHICLE IS
A WHITE PANELED TRUCK,

15:36.669 --> 15:38.771
ICE CREAM DESIGN
ON BOTH SIDES.

15:38.837 --> 15:41.907
SUSPECT CONSIDERED ARMED
AND<i> EXTREMELY</i> DANGEROUS.

15:41.974 --> 15:44.710
I WANT THIS
FUCKIN' PSYCHO STOPPED.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.779
( cop )
THEY THINK

15:46.845 --> 15:48.681
I'M RIDING WITH YOU.

15:48.747 --> 15:50.883
( cop )
C'MON, PEOPLE,
LET'S ROLL.

15:50.949 --> 15:53.185
WHAT'S GOING ON,
SOMETHING ABOUT MY DAUGHTER ?

15:53.252 --> 15:56.488
MAYBE, WE GOT UNITS IN PURSUIT
OF A POTENTIAL SUSPECT.

15:56.555 --> 15:57.256
OH, MY GOD.

15:57.323 --> 15:58.557
WHAT ABOUT CYAN ?

15:58.624 --> 15:59.692

16:11.570 --> 16:14.006
SO HE GRABS THE GIRL...

16:14.973 --> 16:17.009
I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.044

AND THEN...

16:20.546 --> 16:22.781
AND THE HOUSE

16:31.056 --> 16:31.824
WHOA !

16:41.467 --> 16:42.534

17:10.829 --> 17:13.399
WHO'S THAT JERK-OFF
ON TOP OF THE TRUCK ?

17:13.465 --> 17:15.300
NO IDEA, SIR.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.837

HE'S HISTORY, AM I CLEAR ?

17:18.904 --> 17:21.140

19:04.309 --> 19:07.513
THE ANSWER IS CRYSTALLIZED
IN AN INSTANT.

19:07.579 --> 19:10.682
THEIR INSTINCTS
POINT THEM ONLY ONE WAY.

19:10.749 --> 19:13.485
THE TRUTH BECOMES
UNDENIABLE

19:13.552 --> 19:15.521
AND APOCALYPTIC.

19:44.283 --> 19:45.584

19:54.026 --> 19:56.962
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR PUSSIES
IN SATAN'S ARMY.
