00:16.181 --> 00:17.683
Next, please.

00:18.268 --> 00:19.643
Come on, come on.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.270
Next.

00:21.646 --> 00:22.771
Name.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.648
Gus Gorman.

00:32.448 --> 00:34.783
Ah, yes. August Gorman.

00:34.951 --> 00:37.244
Have you looked for work this week?

00:37.787 --> 00:40.164
- Yes.
- What kind?

00:42.417 --> 00:45.294
- Kitchen technician.
- Dishwasher. Any luck?

00:46.171 --> 00:47.212
No, but...

00:47.380 --> 00:51.091
Mr. Gorman, according to our records,
you've been unemployed for 36 weeks.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.426
No, it's 35.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.470
Not counting this week.

00:54.721 --> 00:59.099
You secured employment in June as
a messenger and were discharged afterâ€¦

00:59.267 --> 01:02.061
- ... one day for losing...
- No, they said I lost it.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.313
I did not lose it!
It was stolen by a pickpocket.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.940
A television set?

01:07.192 --> 01:10.819
It was a teeny-tiny, teeny-weensy
Japanese television set.

01:10.987 --> 01:15.949
The other employment you found
was in a fast-food joint, which lasted...

01:16.159 --> 01:17.493
...28 minutes?

01:17.994 --> 01:20.329
That's some kind of record.
Talk about fast.

01:20.580 --> 01:25.084
Those people are crazy. They expect
you to learn that stuff in one day.

01:25.293 --> 01:29.254
"Hold the lettuce. Hold the ketchup.
Can I have some sauce, please?"

01:29.464 --> 01:32.007
- Mr. Gorman...
- "Two buns. No buns. Some cheese."

01:32.342 --> 01:35.719
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis
is generous to a fault, but...

01:36.012 --> 01:37.096
I'm not the fault!

01:37.263 --> 01:39.181
Thirty-six weeks
of chronic unemployment.

01:39.349 --> 01:42.518
Thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes
of hard-working citizens.

01:42.727 --> 01:45.979
- Do you know what you are?
- Don't call me a bum, I'm not a bum!

01:46.940 --> 01:51.819
You are, I was about to say,
no longer eligible.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.862
- Well, look...
- Next.

01:54.030 --> 01:56.156
Wait. What about this week?
I need this week!

01:56.533 --> 01:57.616
Next.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.535
You mean, that's it?

01:59.869 --> 02:01.745
"Finished," like "over"?

02:05.625 --> 02:06.750
Next.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.252
"Next" as in "bye."

02:10.003 --> 02:11.255
Next!

02:14.259 --> 02:15.342
Name.

02:17.053 --> 02:19.054
Excuse me, brother,
can I have a light?

02:49.711 --> 02:51.920
- How you doing, Alex?
- Hi, Jimmy.

03:51.105 --> 03:53.106
Huh? Ah.

04:49.706 --> 04:50.914
Excuse me.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.616
Say thank you.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.368
Wow!

06:26.636 --> 06:28.970
Way to go, Superman!

07:44.714 --> 07:46.882
VOICE:
Your drink is on its way.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.551
Sir.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.303
Excuse me...

07:53.306 --> 07:58.018
...but what if you wanna program two
bilateral coordinates at the same time?

07:58.227 --> 08:00.228
You can't do that. It's impossible.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.147
- But if you can't...
- Oh, no.

08:02.356 --> 08:06.401
Computer technology is very advanced,
young lady, but it can't do that.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.571
- But if you think we can't
do it that way, what happens...?

08:09.739 --> 08:11.364
Sir.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.913
Good Lord.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.915
How did you do that?

08:20.124 --> 08:23.710
I don't know. I just did it.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.232
- Who's this?
- That's him, Ross Webster.

08:45.441 --> 08:48.443
- Just after he received the award for
Humanitarian of the Year.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.362
He is good-looking.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.447
Because I gave him f. 2 at a 50th.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.449
One thing I don't understand...

08:54.659 --> 08:58.954
...the point of the story Lois wrote
is how Ross got this great honor...

08:59.121 --> 09:02.791
...and you bring me one picture of him
and 15 pictures of this other person.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.627
- Who is she?
- Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's...

09:05.795 --> 09:08.463
She's just Webster's.
Let's leave it at that.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.299
- Who's this other woman?
- His sister, Vera Webster.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.801
- Picture looks fuzzy.
- What?

09:12.969 --> 09:16.763
The picture's fine, chief.
She looks like that in real life.

09:17.306 --> 09:21.184
- She's VP of Webscoe Industries.
- I really don't understand you.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.688
A boring banquet and you bring me
3000 boring pictures.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.649
Yet Superman saves a man
from drowning on Third Avenue...

09:27.817 --> 09:31.236
...while you just stand there and
you don't bring me one picture!

09:31.404 --> 09:33.238
Chief, I didn't have
my camera with me.

09:33.447 --> 09:37.826
A photographer eats with his camera.
A photographer sleeps with his camera.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.453
- I'm glad I'm a writer.
- Mr. White, please.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.832
It's time for you to draw this month's
winning JINGO number.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.585
Prize is an all-expenses trip
to South America.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.588
- I don't know why the idiot in Circulation...
- Good morning.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.798
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.758
You've got mustard on your lapel.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.969
Excuse me, Mr. White,
I hate to interrupt...

09:56.178 --> 09:58.430
Sorry. I'm busy.
I got a paper to get out here.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.682
It'll never replace the printing press.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.852
- What's the number, Mr. White?
- Fifty-three.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.023
- Mr. White...
- Fifty-three!

10:08.649 --> 10:11.693
- Mr. White...
- You've got to pull three more numbers.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.654
I promised I'd call them back today.
What do you think?

10:15.197 --> 10:18.867
- Well, I don't know, Kent...
- I think it'd make a terrific story.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.703
What's a terrific story?

10:21.871 --> 10:24.247
Kent's been invited
to his high-school reunion.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.207
- Say.
- Yeah.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.209
Could we have the next number?

10:28.377 --> 10:30.879
It's practically an
American institution. Isn't it?

10:31.047 --> 10:35.008
I don't know, Mr. Kent. Most of
the people I know are still in high school.

10:38.554 --> 10:39.638
Thirty-three.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.557
What I thought this story
would be about, Mr. White, is...

10:42.767 --> 10:44.392
Thirty-three.

10:44.894 --> 10:48.396
...is how much the typical small town
has changed in the last 15 years.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.773
Take me, for example:

10:49.982 --> 10:53.652
Can I really go back to middle America
now as a Metropolis sophisticate?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.821
I'm really excited about this.
In fact, I was looking around...

10:57.031 --> 10:59.491
...in my closet last night...

10:59.700 --> 11:03.536
...and I even found
my old high-school sweater.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.916
- Smallville.
- Mr. White.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.585
Can I go ahead
and make my travel plan?

11:10.795 --> 11:12.295
Same question about mine.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.925
Tell your people the prodigal son
and his photographer are coming home.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.927
Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. White.

11:20.846 --> 11:24.099
It isn't easy for me to lose
one of my best reporters.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.685
- That's okay.
- You deserve the vacation, Lois.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.103
Thank you.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.232
Lois, are you going someplace?

11:33.442 --> 11:37.112
Clark, you know some people
get to go all the way to Smallville...

11:37.279 --> 11:41.074
...and then there are others of us
who have to go to Bermuda.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.909
Golly.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.452
- Bye.
- Bye, Miss Lane.

11:45.955 --> 11:49.958
- Have fun.
- Mr. White, the next number, please.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.128
Well, I guess I better be going too.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.756
So I'll be going.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.219
Bye.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.807
Couldn't we get a computer to do this?

12:29.165 --> 12:31.875
- Hey, what is this?
- First paycheck.

12:32.293 --> 12:36.504
This is the first rip-off, man! We're
supposed to get 225 a week, right?

12:36.672 --> 12:39.966
This says, "$143.80."
How am I supposed to live on that?

12:40.176 --> 12:43.470
State tax, federal tax,
social security tax...

12:43.637 --> 12:46.306
It's so you're still getting
some money when you hit 65.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.683
So I'm getting money when I...? 65?

12:48.934 --> 12:50.185
I want mine now!

12:50.394 --> 12:54.898
I want to enjoy it while I'm young.
I wanna get up and get down. Boogie.

12:56.400 --> 13:01.196
Actually, it's probably more like
$143.80 and one half cent.

13:01.405 --> 13:05.700
There are always fractions left over,
but big corporations round it down.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.703
What do I do with half a cent?
Buy a thoroughbred mouse?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.705
Everybody loses those fractions?

13:10.956 --> 13:13.708
They don't lose them.
You can't lose what you never got.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.127
Then what happens?
The company gets them?

13:16.337 --> 13:20.965
They can't be bothered collecting that
from your paycheck any more than you.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.550
Then what happens to them?

13:22.843 --> 13:25.694
Well, they're just
floating around out there.

13:25.695 --> 13:27.305
The computers know where.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.015
How many sugars?

13:29.725 --> 13:31.059
One and a half.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.193
It's quitting time, Gus. You coming?

13:40.361 --> 13:45.031
Yeah. No, actually, I got some
stuff to finish up, so...

13:45.241 --> 13:50.078
Working overtime, huh? What are you
doing, buddy? Looking for a raise?

13:50.871 --> 13:53.248
Yeah, looking for a raise.

14:30.744 --> 14:31.786
You bet.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.629
- But my Uncle Al on my father's
side, he won't eat her stuffing.

14:41.797 --> 14:46.467
He says it should be cooked on the outside.
She cooks it on the inside.

14:46.635 --> 14:49.804
My mother told my Aunt Helen.
She's my father's half sister.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.140
- I told you that, right?
- Yeah.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.017
- And anyway, the family...
- Hey, hey.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.311
- Look at that.
- Wow.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.339
Okay, your choice:

15:08.340 --> 15:11.492
You can turn back or
pull over till it's over.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.245
- How long will it take?
- Can't tell with these fires.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.498
I mean, that fire...
That's spreading like wildfire.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.167
It's just a building burning.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.669
It's not just a building.
That's a chemical plant.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.465
You know what I mean.
It's like... It's like chemicals.

15:25.674 --> 15:30.303
If any of that stuff goes up in smoke,
we're in for a hairy time around here.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.306
- Clark.
- Yeah?

15:33.474 --> 15:35.683
I want you to keep
these people distracted.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.018
What are you doing?

15:37.186 --> 15:40.313
What am I doing?
Remember what the chief said?

15:40.481 --> 15:42.690
A photographer always
goes after a story.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.442
That could be dangerous, Jimmy.

15:44.652 --> 15:48.696
Danger goes with the territory,
Mr. Kent.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.486
Help me!

16:32.408 --> 16:34.742
- How can I help?
- Get this man a helmet.

16:34.910 --> 16:37.120
- It's you. Forget the helmet.
- How bad is it?

16:37.329 --> 16:41.708
My God, it's a nightmare. Everything's
either explosive or flammable or worse.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.338
Get the ladder truck in here.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.383
- It won't reach.
- My God, they're trapped!

16:51.135 --> 16:53.928
What's he gonna do?
Fly them down one at a time?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.281
Let's go! Everybody,
down there! Move it!

17:14.532 --> 17:16.117
Come on! Hurry up!

17:16.285 --> 17:17.410
There you go.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.165
Right down there. Take it easy.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.252
All right. Everybody down there!

17:29.298 --> 17:30.631
Keep moving!

18:03.832 --> 18:06.000
Sir, get out. I'll show you
the quickest way.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.336
Go on. Look after the others.
I can't leave.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.755
- Why not?
- I gotta stay and look after those.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.507
That's concentrated Beltric acid.

18:12.716 --> 18:15.802
If that stuff heats up over 180 degrees,
we've got a crisis...

18:16.011 --> 18:18.346
...that'll make this fire
look like a picnic.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.597
What does it do?

18:19.848 --> 18:22.642
- As long as it remains stable,
it's just ordinary acid.

18:23.018 --> 18:26.312
But if it begins to heat up,
it'll turn volatile.

18:26.522 --> 18:29.732
You'll get a great cloud of smoke
that will eat through anything.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.527
Steel, concrete, anything.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.164
Who the hell is that?

18:45.332 --> 18:50.169
- Hey, you! Get off of there!
- I'm just gonna get a couple more shots.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.471
Ow! Ah!

19:06.395 --> 19:09.772
Tell them to bring their hoses
back here! Quickly!

19:12.776 --> 19:13.860
Help!

19:14.695 --> 19:17.196
Help! Help me!

19:19.032 --> 19:22.535
Help! Somebody help me!

19:23.495 --> 19:25.079
- Help!
- It's all right.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.915
- Superman! My leg.
- I got you. Take it easy.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.876
All right. We'll go nice and easy.

19:30.085 --> 19:33.880
Okay, I'm sorry.
All right? Here we go.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.927
Medics! Over here, please.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.722
That's it. Here you go.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.432
Go easy. It's the left leg.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.268
- My camera.
- Yeah.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.813
It's a clean break right across the fibula.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.901
- My camera.
- Sorry, Jimmy. You'll be okay.

19:56.403 --> 20:00.823
Get that fire out, otherwise there'll be an
acid cloud all over the Eastern seaboard.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.455
- The pump house is gone!
- What?

20:07.623 --> 20:10.124
- The pump house!
- We've lost the water pressure!

20:11.835 --> 20:13.628
- We've got to have water!
- How?

20:13.795 --> 20:16.797
Lake Comooga's five miles from here.
We'd need a five-mile hose!

20:16.965 --> 20:18.966
- Where's this lake?
- That way.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.768
Tell them it's hopeless.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.354
You told me we had
an adequate water supply.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.541
Water!

21:48.724 --> 21:50.725
I tell you, that man's a miracle!

22:16.585 --> 22:19.086
Carol, you got gorgeous!

22:30.599 --> 22:32.224
Look at you.

22:40.525 --> 22:43.736
- That was against Mid-City.
I'll never forget it.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.906
Fourth quarter, score was tied...

22:47.574 --> 22:49.784
...we're back at the 25-yard line.

22:50.077 --> 22:53.287
Coach sends in a play,
Right Flanker Option.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.424
You really have grown, Clark.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.468
You look very well, Miss Bannister.

23:07.636 --> 23:12.431
I can't complain. I take the stairs
a little slow and I have these spells.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.142
But really, I can't complain.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.103
Lana?

23:18.271 --> 23:19.313
Clark?

23:24.903 --> 23:28.489
Would you excuse me? There's someone
I'd really like to say hello to.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.077
Lana?

23:34.454 --> 23:37.623
- Lana Lang? It's great to see you.
- Clark.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.336
- You look wonderful.
- Me? No, you look...

23:42.546 --> 23:45.548
- Let me give you a hand with that.
- No, no. I can manage.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.675
Uh...

23:49.052 --> 23:52.304
This is the first time you've come back
since your mom passed away.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.348
Yeah. I'm sorry.

23:57.352 --> 23:58.519
I heard that you and...

23:59.479 --> 24:01.814
- ... Donald split up.
- Did you eat yet?

24:02.023 --> 24:03.065
No.

24:03.358 --> 24:06.068
Beg your pardon. Excuse me. Sorry.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.699
- That's not right.
- No?

24:11.867 --> 24:14.368
You're right about Donald and me,
but... Hold this, okay?

24:14.578 --> 24:15.953
Oh, sure.

24:18.373 --> 24:19.874
Hi, Kent.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.501
Hi. How you doing?

24:23.712 --> 24:26.005
I'm sorry. I'm going nuts. Thanks.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.844
- Clark.
- Yeah.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.221
Lana.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.891
Uh-oh. Um...

24:37.225 --> 24:38.392
Hey, sweet.

24:38.727 --> 24:39.894
Here I am.

24:41.104 --> 24:45.232
Remember when you were prom queen?
All these guys were waiting for a dance?

24:45.400 --> 24:48.068
There's only one guy on your
dance card now. Huh, honey?

24:48.236 --> 24:50.112
- That's good old...
- Brad Wilson.

24:50.697 --> 24:53.157
- Hi, Brad.
- Hi, Kent.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.242
Long time no see.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.328
You know, see, see, see?

24:57.996 --> 25:00.539
- Come on, Lana.
- No, I can't.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.875
- Clark already asked me.
- I did?

25:03.043 --> 25:04.877
- Yeah.
- Oh, excuse me.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.880
Lana, I haven't danced...

25:52.676 --> 25:55.469
Ah, Gorman.
Another week, another check.

25:58.390 --> 26:02.309
Don't you have another one for me?
I put in a voucher for expenses.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.811
What?

26:07.148 --> 26:08.190
Yeah, yeah.

26:08.483 --> 26:09.692
Here you go.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.663
Ooo...

26:32.340 --> 26:34.091
Thanks for helping me out.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.011
You kidding? A lot of guys
would like to be where I am.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.638
You'd be surprised at how many
offers I didn't get.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.515
Even Brad wouldn't stick around.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.183
It really isn't easy.

26:43.351 --> 26:45.352
The streamers?
Yeah, you just pull, and...

26:45.520 --> 26:48.022
No, not the streamers. Everything.

26:48.231 --> 26:50.524
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just that...

26:50.775 --> 26:53.694
...I don't know why,
I just feel like I can talk to you.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.987
What?

26:55.155 --> 26:57.489
I feel like I can talk to you!

26:58.450 --> 27:00.034
- You can?
- Yes.

27:00.243 --> 27:02.202
- You know something, Lana?
- What?

27:04.247 --> 27:05.539
I always...

27:06.333 --> 27:08.042
I always wished that you would.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.210
I mean, even back in high school.

27:10.378 --> 27:13.047
- Remember when you were...?
- Queen of the prom.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.675
Then three years after the royal wedding,
the king abdicated.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.053
- Isn't that terrible?
- Yeah, sure is.

27:19.220 --> 27:23.057
There must be a gallon
of potato salad left over.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.559
You know what the problem is?

27:26.686 --> 27:28.562
I don't know, too much mayonnaise?

27:28.772 --> 27:31.523
Donald loved mayonnaise.
Why would that be the problem?

27:31.733 --> 27:34.568
No, the problem is,
why do I stay in Smallville?

27:34.778 --> 27:36.528
Believe me, I've asked myself that.

27:36.780 --> 27:41.241
Do you know how lucky you are
to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.

27:41.409 --> 27:42.660
Well, Lana, you could...

27:42.827 --> 27:45.579
Easy to say. But how?
What about Ricky?

27:45.830 --> 27:48.165
- Ricky?
- My little boy.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.709
- You? Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

27:50.919 --> 27:55.422
I mean, at least here we have a house
and I've got a job that pays the bills.

27:55.590 --> 27:59.093
Except for last winter when
the fuel bills kept going up and up.

27:59.803 --> 28:02.596
Yeah. Even had to pawn
my diamond ring then.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.223
That's a shame.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.607
You never got married?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.319
- Me?
- Yeah.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.279
Well, I was...

28:20.740 --> 28:22.282
No. Not...

28:31.459 --> 28:34.336
You know, years later you can
look at someone and think:

28:34.587 --> 28:37.339
"Well, I guess that's
the one that got away."

28:42.220 --> 28:45.806
Give me that again, old buddy.
Run it by me just one more time.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.475
- Eighty-five thousand dollars.
- Missing?

28:48.643 --> 28:52.229
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.
Stolen from the firm.

28:52.439 --> 28:53.647
By whom?

28:53.857 --> 28:56.358
That's what I want to know.
By whom? Whom?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.152
Vera, get a hold of yourself.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.446
Nobody else ever will.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.322
I don't know.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.490
Whom?

29:03.658 --> 29:05.826
In the old days it was simple.

29:05.994 --> 29:10.372
We kept books, we knew what was
going in and what was paid out.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.249
If somebody wanted to rob you...

29:12.417 --> 29:14.960
...they'd come in with a gun and say,
"Stick them up."

29:15.170 --> 29:18.297
Now they get blasted computers
to do their dirty work.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.759
My old friend, you are yesterday.

29:21.968 --> 29:24.845
Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.

29:26.973 --> 29:29.141
Mr. Webster,
it's time for your massage.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.185
Does this woman
have the right to burst in...?

29:31.394 --> 29:34.980
Now, now, Vera. Simpson,
you know my psychic nutritionist?

29:35.190 --> 29:39.318
- Hello.
- We are trying to hold a meeting here.

29:39.486 --> 29:43.530
Why don't you hold your breath instead.
Maybe you'll turn blue.

29:43.698 --> 29:47.034
- Improvement.
- I'm about to take a human life.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.412
Simpson, would you excuse us
for a second, please?

29:54.000 --> 29:57.044
- Mouths closed. Ears open.
- She's a big pig.

29:57.212 --> 30:00.339
I can't have anyone with me
who isn't with me.

30:00.673 --> 30:02.049
Now, girls.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.009
Simpson.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.719
Well, old chum. What now?

30:05.970 --> 30:08.680
Kiss the 85 thou goodbye?

30:08.890 --> 30:12.684
Keep on paying the thief his salary
until he shakes the money tree again?

30:12.894 --> 30:15.979
- He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
- Why?

30:16.189 --> 30:18.524
That's what they always say
in the movies.

30:18.733 --> 30:21.235
He won't slip up at all. No, not at all.

30:21.444 --> 30:24.071
He'll keep quietly taking
the bread from our mouths.

30:24.239 --> 30:28.492
He'll keep a low profile and won't
do a thing to call attention to himself.

30:28.701 --> 30:33.080
Unless, of course, he is
a complete and utter moron.

30:50.723 --> 30:52.474
I'll go first. Andrew.

30:52.684 --> 30:56.103
- I'll pick Chris.
- You feel good? You feel ready?

30:56.354 --> 30:57.604
LANA
Ricky, your shoe.

30:57.772 --> 31:01.108
- You mean, we've gotta take Ricky?
- You guys lost the toss.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.443
All right, come on, Ricky.

31:03.611 --> 31:05.612
- Wait, wait...
- Come on, good luck.

31:06.739 --> 31:09.575
- I just can't stand this.
- Oh, Lana. It'll be okay.

31:09.784 --> 31:12.077
I know, I was a late bloomer myself.

31:12.287 --> 31:16.957
It's not just that he's small, he's
the only kid in town without a father.

31:17.375 --> 31:21.712
Oh, look. He's stewed to the gills
in the middle of the afternoon.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.089
- Gee, all he had was chocolate milk.
- No, him.

31:24.299 --> 31:25.757
Hey, sweet thing.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.135
Little kid getting hassled, huh?

31:28.803 --> 31:31.305
- Kent, you still here?
- I seem to be, Brad.

31:31.514 --> 31:34.224
All he needs is a few pointers
from the old champ here.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.269
I won the all-country bowling
trophy two years in a row.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.478
I didn't know that.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.606
Yeah. Natural athlete
can play any sport.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.566
Brad, you're just gonna
make it worse.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.235
- It's all right. It'll be okay.
- He'll make it worse.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.577
You watch, he'll get a spare.

31:53.828 --> 31:55.287
Come on, Ricky.

31:56.664 --> 31:58.540
Hey, kid, you're holding it all wrong.

31:59.125 --> 32:02.419
- Let old Brad show you how it's done.
- Brad.

32:03.338 --> 32:07.341
Excuse me. Say, Brad, I think maybe
he'll be better off doing it his way.

32:07.592 --> 32:11.136
For a guy lucky to be waterboy,
you've got a big mouth.

32:11.554 --> 32:14.598
I don't think he needs a lesson
in front of the other kids.

32:14.807 --> 32:18.685
- He needs a man to show him.
- He's doing just fine. Excuse me.

32:20.563 --> 32:21.855
Here you go, Ricky.

32:22.065 --> 32:25.067
And give it your best shot.
Okay? There you go.

32:27.487 --> 32:28.695
Sorry.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.370
Ah-choo!

32:44.796 --> 32:46.213
Gesundheit.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.547
Thank you.

32:50.593 --> 32:52.844
Hey, Gus, the boss wants to see you.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.597
He can see me all right.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

32:55.807 --> 32:59.226
No, not that boss. The boss.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.895
- You mean, the boss...
- Yup.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.563
- ... wants to see me?
- Yup.

33:03.731 --> 33:06.900
Oh, my God,
why would he wanna see me?

33:07.110 --> 33:08.235
I mean...

33:09.570 --> 33:11.905
Why would the boss wanna see me?

33:13.157 --> 33:14.825
There's no reason.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.619
Then why'd he...? Oh, I know!

33:17.829 --> 33:20.914
It's my suggestion
for the volleyball uniforms.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.332
That's it.

33:34.929 --> 33:38.140
Ross the boss.
Ross the boss. The boss!

33:39.058 --> 33:41.143
Be calm. Be cool. Be collected.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.859
Mr. Webster? Mr. Webster?

33:49.402 --> 33:52.696
Mr. Webster, I did not... Mr. Webster.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.115
Mr. August Gorman?

33:55.283 --> 33:56.533
August Gorman here.

33:56.743 --> 34:01.288
I know you're a man of compassion,
and I don't wanna go to jail...

34:01.456 --> 34:03.457
...because they have robbers
and rapists...

34:03.666 --> 34:06.043
I just wanna ask you one question.

34:06.252 --> 34:08.962
You've been a naughty guy,
haven't you?

34:09.213 --> 34:10.630
Come on, admit it now.

34:10.797 --> 34:13.300
You've been just a little bit naughty,
haven't you?

34:13.551 --> 34:16.303
- I was kind of...
- That's all right. I understand.

34:16.471 --> 34:19.681
I can... What do
the young folks say today?

34:19.891 --> 34:22.559
"Dig where you're
coming from, brother."

34:22.768 --> 34:25.603
- You wanna be rich, right?
- How, wha...

34:25.813 --> 34:29.315
I was born rich. Never worn
the same pair of socks twice.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.984
What do you do with your socks?

34:31.235 --> 34:35.112
I don't know. They're laundered and sent
to some charitable institution, I think.

34:35.322 --> 34:38.492
Actually, I don't know.
Maybe they turn them into dust rags...

34:38.701 --> 34:40.159
...or pen-wipers or something.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.995
Or maybe socks.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.956
Yes! That never occurred to me.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.960
Gus, you know something?
You're a genius.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.839
A naughty genius, but what the hell?
Nobody's perfect, right? Cheers.

34:53.007 --> 34:56.009
Because of the half-cent thing
with the computers.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.179
No, no, because computers
rule the world today.

34:59.347 --> 35:03.016
The fellow that can fool the computers
can rule the world himself.

35:04.018 --> 35:07.521
I've been searching for somebody
who can make these machines...

35:07.688 --> 35:10.023
...do what they're not supposed to.
Get my drift?

35:10.441 --> 35:12.150
- Yes!
- Gus...

35:12.318 --> 35:17.114
...Webscoe, the Webscoe industrial
complex, is a family-owned cartel.

35:17.323 --> 35:19.199
Some magnesium here,
some zinc there.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.368
Railroads, farm machinery.
You follow me?

35:21.536 --> 35:23.036
I follow you, sir.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.372
- Gus, do you know what I want now?
- No.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.623
I want coffee.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.542
All right. Black, cream, sugar, or...?

35:28.751 --> 35:30.794
No, you don't seem to understand.

35:31.003 --> 35:34.381
Under different company names,
I control the price of coffee beans...

35:34.632 --> 35:38.760
...in Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia,
Jamaica and the Republic of Gabon.

35:38.970 --> 35:42.722
But I've got a problem and I think
maybe you can help me.

35:42.890 --> 35:46.893
One country won't play ball with me.
You know how that can bug a guy, right?

35:47.061 --> 35:49.396
That could bug... What country?

35:50.773 --> 35:53.024
- Colombia.
- Colombia?

35:53.192 --> 35:56.194
Colombia has two important exports,
and one of them's coffee.

35:56.404 --> 36:00.031
And I've tried to reason with them.
Believe me, I've tried.

36:00.241 --> 36:03.368
But this one miserable,
pissant little country...

36:03.578 --> 36:08.915
...has the gall to think it can dictate
the economy of an open market. Gus.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.751
Gus, my friend...

36:12.587 --> 36:15.380
...we're going to teach them
a lesson, aren't we?

36:16.424 --> 36:19.259
Destroy the entire
Colombian coffee crop...

36:19.427 --> 36:21.928
...right down to the last bean.

36:22.096 --> 36:24.389
- The last bean, we are.
- Right.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.934
But you got so much. You know, like...

36:28.102 --> 36:30.812
A wise man once said,
I think it was Attila the Hun:

36:31.022 --> 36:33.607
"It is not enough that I succeed.

36:33.816 --> 36:36.776
Everyone else must fail."

36:37.028 --> 36:38.528
Seems fair.

36:38.821 --> 36:40.280
- Gus.
- What?

36:40.448 --> 36:44.117
You are going to do this for me.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.914
- How?
- The weather.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.291
You didn't say your mother was here.

36:51.459 --> 36:54.461
I'm his sister. His baby sister.

36:54.629 --> 36:57.631
Gus, tell me, have you ever
heard of Vulcan?

36:57.965 --> 36:59.299
Hi, Ms. Vulcan.

36:59.467 --> 37:02.260
Vulcan is the weather satellite
our government put up...

37:02.470 --> 37:03.803
...to monitor the weather.

37:03.971 --> 37:08.266
But if somebody were to reprogram it,
it could do much more.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.101
It could make weather.

37:10.269 --> 37:11.811
Storms and floods.

37:11.979 --> 37:13.772
Blizzards, heat waves.

37:13.981 --> 37:15.148
How do you do that?

37:15.566 --> 37:18.818
Like everything else
in the 20th century, Gus.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.487
You push buttons.

37:22.156 --> 37:25.367
- There you go.
- It's the first time I won anything.

37:25.576 --> 37:26.826
You won my hand, Maury.

37:26.994 --> 37:29.829
But this is the first time
I won anything valuable.

37:29.997 --> 37:31.665
Let's get one with the sombreros.

37:31.874 --> 37:35.168
Mr. White, you'll be in this,
handing them their plane tickets.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.837
- Why do I have to do this?
- Why do I have to do this?

37:38.005 --> 37:41.341
You're lucky I didn't fire you.
I get a chance at exclusive photos...

37:41.509 --> 37:43.343
...of history's biggest factory fire.

37:43.511 --> 37:46.346
He comes home with a broken leg
and 12 melted rolls of film.

37:46.514 --> 37:47.847
It was hot.

37:48.015 --> 37:50.183
Smile, Mr. White.

37:51.185 --> 37:53.770
South America!
I can't believe my luck!

37:54.272 --> 37:57.190
See, if you don't want them
to trace it back...

37:57.400 --> 38:00.527
...you've gotta punch in
to some little rinky-dink outfit...

38:00.695 --> 38:03.154
...that has a little
Mickey Mouse computer...

38:03.364 --> 38:06.324
Someplace you can sneak into, right?

38:06.534 --> 38:07.701
Somebody could...

38:07.910 --> 38:11.913
Someplace where nobody knows him
so they can't connect him with us.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.040
Webscoe has 112 subsidiaries.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.210
They're all linked into
the central computer system.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.045
How about someplace...

38:20.006 --> 38:21.047
...small?

38:23.718 --> 38:27.721
- Smallville. This is Smallville.
We'll have a five-minute stop here.

38:28.681 --> 38:29.723
Mind your step.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.725
Watch your step, please.

38:32.476 --> 38:33.518
Thanks, Selma.

38:33.686 --> 38:36.062
Thanks a lot, Lana.
Have a good day, now.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.901
Let me help you, Lana.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.447
I'm sorry.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.535
- Thanks, Clark.
- Sit down, Buster. Good boy.

38:50.745 --> 38:53.246
- Come on, Buster, sit down.
That's a good boy.

38:53.456 --> 38:55.332
Okay. You all set? Great.

38:59.086 --> 39:00.837
Wow.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.096
I'm not saying another word.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.600
That's it. Okay?

39:15.186 --> 39:17.437
Jesus Christ!

39:22.109 --> 39:25.111
Don't they have picnics in Metropolis,
Mr. Kent?

39:25.363 --> 39:27.280
Well, not quite like this, Ricky.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.449
- Mom and I do this all the time.
- You do?

39:29.617 --> 39:32.619
- I'll help you.
- Stay close by and be careful, okay?

39:32.787 --> 39:34.120
Okay, Mom.

39:34.288 --> 39:37.707
- Come on, Buster. Let's find you
a rabbit. Come on. Rabbit.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.793
- This is so nice for him.
- Here you go.

39:40.044 --> 39:43.421
It's even nicer when there's a man around,
which isn't that often.

39:43.589 --> 39:46.132
- There's a lot of choices.
- The good ones are married.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.635
That's why Brad thinks
he's God's gift to women.

39:49.303 --> 39:52.305
He won't take no for an answer,
but he's the only one asking.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.141
No, Lana, I meant
there's a lot of choices here.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.936
This is really quite some picnic.
There's...

39:58.729 --> 40:00.021
...some of that.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.732
Green stuff.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.819
Hey, pâté.

40:08.155 --> 40:10.615
Boy, this pâté is really unusual.

40:11.158 --> 40:13.451
I didn't make any... Oh, Clark.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.912
That's Buster's dog food.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.331
- It's good.
- Don't eat it!

40:18.541 --> 40:19.833
What time's the dog eat?

40:20.042 --> 40:21.960
- This is nice.
- Here.

40:22.169 --> 40:23.670
It's all right, Lana.

40:25.297 --> 40:26.506
Thanks.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.176
Hey, where you going? Come on!

40:30.344 --> 40:32.303
Buster, stop messing about!

40:35.558 --> 40:37.517
- How much longer...?
- I was just thinking...

40:37.685 --> 40:40.186
- I'm sorry. No, go ahead.
- No. You.

40:43.357 --> 40:45.024
Well...

40:46.694 --> 40:48.528
...I was just thinking that...

40:48.696 --> 40:51.698
...somebody like you
could do really well in Metropolis.

40:52.199 --> 40:56.578
I suppose I have to face it. I'm not gonna
find what I want in Smallville anymore.

40:59.165 --> 41:02.876
Could I make it in Metropolis?
What would I do when I got there?

41:05.337 --> 41:06.379
Call me.

41:06.547 --> 41:09.549
- No, I wouldn't wanna call you.
- You don't wanna call me?

41:09.717 --> 41:14.095
Yes, I wanna call you, but I wouldn't
wanna be a nuisance to you.

41:14.597 --> 41:17.223
I don't think you could ever
be a nuisance to me, Lana.

41:19.602 --> 41:21.227
Clark, may I tell you something?

41:25.232 --> 41:26.733
My oil pan is leaking.

41:32.656 --> 41:34.407
See? There's something dripping.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.242
- Can I give you a hand?
- No, thanks.

41:36.827 --> 41:40.246
With all the car trouble I have,
I studied up on auto repair.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.332
Look at this.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.834
Oh, boy.

42:11.278 --> 42:14.697
Lana, I think I'll just go see
if Ricky's all right. You okay?

42:14.865 --> 42:16.157
Yeah.

43:03.289 --> 43:05.331
Gosh, is he all right?

43:13.424 --> 43:15.008
Hi.

43:17.636 --> 43:19.178
Superman?

43:19.346 --> 43:20.722
That's me.

43:23.642 --> 43:25.476
Mom! Mom!

43:27.855 --> 43:31.316
There you go. He's all right,
but have a doctor check him.

43:31.525 --> 43:33.192
Thank you.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.862
- I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
- Nice to meet you.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.196
And this is Clark.

43:37.364 --> 43:40.325
I really have to be going.
So long, Ricky. Bye.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.162
We were flying, Mom!

43:44.371 --> 43:45.788
What were you doing, anyway?

43:45.998 --> 43:47.373
I was looking for Buster.

43:47.541 --> 43:50.376
- Buster! Buster!
- I found him!

43:51.629 --> 43:53.046
Come on, boy. That's it.

43:53.297 --> 43:55.882
Mr. Kent, Superman was here!

43:56.133 --> 43:58.259
- What?
- Yes, he really was.

43:59.178 --> 44:00.720
Aren't you excited?

44:00.888 --> 44:03.973
I'm from Metropolis.
I see Superman every day.

44:04.183 --> 44:07.185
You do? Could you get me
his autograph?

44:09.772 --> 44:13.650
I don't know. If I had a nickel
for every time some little kid...

44:36.674 --> 44:38.007
Yeah? What do you want?

44:38.217 --> 44:39.926
We're in big trouble, aren't we?

44:40.094 --> 44:41.928
- What?
- We're in big trouble.

44:42.096 --> 44:43.680
First, they lost the invoice.

44:43.889 --> 44:47.517
When they found it, they realized
they came up short on a few items.

44:47.726 --> 44:51.938
So I rented a car because I missed the
plane from Cleveland. 4:00, you know.

44:52.356 --> 44:55.608
And a flat tire on the highway.
What a kicker.

44:55.818 --> 44:58.945
Had to fix it myself
with these little pinkies.

44:59.446 --> 45:03.741
And I figured your boss was gonna be
real peeved, you know what I mean?

45:04.118 --> 45:05.118
What do you mean?

45:05.327 --> 45:07.954
He is going to hang our butts
against the wall.

45:08.455 --> 45:11.082
He wanted this special order installed...

45:11.250 --> 45:13.876
...in his office no later
than tomorrow morning.

45:14.086 --> 45:16.295
Let me in because
I gotta set it up tonight.

45:16.463 --> 45:17.797
Get all what set up?

45:27.933 --> 45:31.644
Pal, you are a real lifesaver.
I mean, a real lifesaver.

45:31.854 --> 45:33.980
- Which way's the office?
- Straight on ahead.

45:34.231 --> 45:36.899
- Follow me.
- I'm right behind you.

45:37.067 --> 45:38.443
Oh, yeah.

45:38.610 --> 45:41.112
Not bad. It's pretty good.

45:42.114 --> 45:44.407
You know what's wrong with
this Singapore wing?

45:44.616 --> 45:48.327
Sling! Singapore Sling.

45:48.495 --> 45:50.830
What's wrong with it?

45:50.998 --> 45:52.874
There's not enough vodka in it.

45:53.083 --> 45:55.668
There's no vodka in it!

45:55.919 --> 45:58.463
What did I tell you?
Put some vodka in it.

45:58.672 --> 46:01.466
What did you...? You know.

46:07.681 --> 46:10.433
- Yeah.
- There's vodka in it now, buddy.

46:14.646 --> 46:15.688
Yeah, perfect.

46:16.023 --> 46:19.025
- You never do pass out, do you?
- Nope.

46:23.405 --> 46:24.614
Never.

46:25.532 --> 46:27.658
Job well done, buddy.

46:28.035 --> 46:30.411
You thought I was drunk too,
didn't you? Ha, ha.

46:30.954 --> 46:32.038
Fooled you.

46:32.206 --> 46:34.791
Get the keys, get the keys.

46:53.852 --> 46:55.812
Somebody's drunk.

46:59.483 --> 47:01.234
Hello, baby!

47:02.069 --> 47:03.569
How's the little baby?

47:03.737 --> 47:05.154
Okay.

47:05.572 --> 47:09.450
All right, let's get down to it.
Let's do it.

47:11.078 --> 47:14.247
One, two, button your shoe.

47:30.389 --> 47:34.684
"Both keys at the same time"?

47:34.893 --> 47:36.561
Whoa.

47:48.991 --> 47:50.700
Wait. Wait a minute.

47:50.951 --> 47:52.702
Think you've won, don't you?

47:54.204 --> 47:56.289
The Philly Flash!

48:47.132 --> 48:49.175
Okay, ready?

48:50.302 --> 48:52.970
One, two, three!

49:02.856 --> 49:07.652
Yeah. Now we'll see what we'll see.

50:27.941 --> 50:29.275
Oh.

50:33.196 --> 50:34.613
Oh...

50:44.666 --> 50:46.208
Oh.

51:27.459 --> 51:28.667
Come on, please.

51:31.505 --> 51:32.797
There it is!

51:32.964 --> 51:34.507
Hello! Now...

51:34.716 --> 51:36.342
...getting down to business.

51:39.471 --> 51:41.347
I am a genius.

51:42.849 --> 51:44.517
I am a...

51:53.777 --> 51:55.152
Longitude...

51:55.362 --> 51:58.155
...and the other thing. Latitude, right?

52:15.048 --> 52:17.883
Oh, look, Maury. A native wedding.

52:42.909 --> 52:46.078
No one said at the Daily Planet
that this was the rainy season!

53:23.950 --> 53:27.119
- Meteorologists are baffled
by the tornado and rainstorms...

53:27.329 --> 53:30.122
...that struck the country
of Colombia this afternoon...

53:30.290 --> 53:34.793
...threatening to destroy the nation's
entire coffee crop for the next five years.

53:34.961 --> 53:36.629
Gale-force winds up to...

53:36.838 --> 53:39.965
...an incredible 250 miles an hour
lashed the countryside...

53:40.467 --> 53:44.887
...while 12 inches of rainfall have
already been recorded in just one day.

53:45.555 --> 53:49.808
A spokesman for the Department of
Meteorology said this was, I quote:

53:49.976 --> 53:53.729
"The most awesome display of
natural forces since Noah's ark."

53:53.939 --> 53:56.774
If I laugh any harder, I'll split my sides!

53:56.942 --> 54:00.069
...to defy all laws of
weather systems known to science.

54:03.240 --> 54:04.323
What a shame.

54:06.243 --> 54:08.827
Poor little Colombia. Well...

54:20.006 --> 54:22.508
I'm gonna get you for that,
you big silly!

54:22.676 --> 54:25.636
Bubba, do you realize what we're on to?

54:25.845 --> 54:27.388
Do I?

54:27.597 --> 54:30.683
Every time a drunk sobers up,
he'll drink Webster coffee.

54:30.892 --> 54:32.893
Why stop at coffee?

54:33.270 --> 54:37.022
A cup of coffee gets the world
off to work in the morning.

54:37.190 --> 54:39.316
But what keeps the world working?

54:40.151 --> 54:41.193
Diet soda?

54:42.445 --> 54:44.530
Vera, you mean...? You mean...?

54:44.698 --> 54:47.157
Today, coffee.

54:47.325 --> 54:49.868
Tomorrow, the oil!

54:50.036 --> 54:52.538
- Oil?
- If Gus can push the right buttons...

54:52.706 --> 54:55.457
I can have it all. Holy cats!

54:55.667 --> 54:57.209
All the oil.

54:57.460 --> 54:58.669
All the pumps.

54:58.878 --> 55:00.296
All the tankers.

55:00.505 --> 55:02.047
This is some nifty idea, Vera.

55:02.215 --> 55:03.882
- Boss?
- Very nifty.

55:04.050 --> 55:06.719
- Just the man I want to see.
- Boss, it is not my fault.

55:06.886 --> 55:08.512
Isn't it neat? There...

55:08.722 --> 55:10.556
- What's not your fault?
- Superman.

55:11.308 --> 55:13.892
How was I to know he was
gonna start doing his thing...

55:14.060 --> 55:16.186
...when you started doing your thing?

55:16.396 --> 55:19.148
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talk...?

55:19.357 --> 55:22.234
It was just on television, man.
Didn't you see it?

55:22.444 --> 55:23.819
Don't call me "man."

55:24.029 --> 55:26.238
I just saw Colombia
bite the dust. That's all.

55:26.489 --> 55:30.743
You didn't see the man come flying out
of the sky from the clouds? It was him!

55:31.244 --> 55:33.454
With his cape flapping in the...

55:38.043 --> 55:39.877
His cape was flapping in the wind!

55:40.086 --> 55:42.338
He was flying! He was great!

55:42.547 --> 55:44.340
He was just flying around...

55:44.591 --> 55:47.968
His cape was blowing in the wind
like this. It looked like a flag!

55:49.179 --> 55:52.097
And he landed right in the middle
of this big plantation!

55:54.476 --> 55:57.686
And he checked everything out
with his x-ray vision.

55:57.896 --> 56:02.441
And then he put these laser beams
out of his eyes onto everything.

56:03.234 --> 56:04.777
Straight-out laser points.

56:05.487 --> 56:07.279
Dried up everything!

56:07.489 --> 56:08.947
Just like that!

56:09.115 --> 56:12.242
I'm talking about drying it up,
like machines in the men's rooms.

56:12.410 --> 56:13.452
You know what I mean?

56:13.620 --> 56:15.913
Hot air comes out when you put
your hands under.

56:16.081 --> 56:17.790
Sometimes they don't work, right?

56:17.957 --> 56:19.291
But Superman's worked!

56:19.501 --> 56:22.503
You think he stood around
to take bows? Not this man.

56:22.712 --> 56:25.297
No, sir. He flies off again. Right?

56:25.507 --> 56:27.966
Then he saw what
really caused the trouble.

56:28.134 --> 56:29.927
He flew into the tornado...

56:30.136 --> 56:33.764
...went down to the bottom of it,
and turned it upside down!

56:33.973 --> 56:37.309
He made the little end on top
and the big end on the bottom!

56:37.560 --> 56:39.978
I was gonna go crazy!

56:40.146 --> 56:43.065
I've never seen nothing like it.

56:43.775 --> 56:45.317
The big end was on the bottom.

56:45.568 --> 56:47.277
Little end on the top.

56:48.238 --> 56:50.656
Mr. Ross, it was... The big...

56:53.535 --> 56:54.785
Superman's bad.

56:55.829 --> 56:57.287
I'll say he was.

56:57.455 --> 56:59.665
I mean, he was bad!

56:59.999 --> 57:02.418
No.

57:02.585 --> 57:03.961
No!

57:04.671 --> 57:06.004
Here, let me help.

57:06.172 --> 57:09.508
- It was a perfect plan. It was foolproof!
- And we were the fools.

57:09.676 --> 57:13.554
It's not my fault.
I did what I was supposed to do.

57:14.055 --> 57:17.683
He ruined it.
That lousy do-gooder ruined it.

57:19.185 --> 57:23.856
Now that he's pulled off this stunt,
he'll try and ruin my oil scheme too.

57:25.859 --> 57:27.526
- I've got to get rid of him.
- How?

57:27.694 --> 57:29.862
Shoot him? You know
about him and bullets.

57:30.363 --> 57:32.322
- Kryptonite.
- What?

57:33.658 --> 57:37.077
Or krypton-ham, or krypton-heimer?

57:37.370 --> 57:40.539
I forget what you call it,
but it's stuff that can hurt Superman.

57:40.707 --> 57:43.542
- How would you know about that?
- I know a few things.

57:43.710 --> 57:45.335
I know, from the graffiti I saw.

57:45.503 --> 57:46.879
Wait a second.

57:47.088 --> 57:48.213
She's right.

57:48.465 --> 57:51.675
Kryptonite. I remember reading
about it in an interview with him.

57:51.843 --> 57:53.093
Where does it come from?

57:53.303 --> 57:55.554
- The same planet Superman
came from: Krypton.

57:55.722 --> 57:57.222
Where is Krypton?

57:57.390 --> 57:58.724
It's nowhere.

57:58.892 --> 58:00.559
It blew up in space, years ago.

58:00.727 --> 58:04.229
They sent Superman here from there
when he was just a baby.

58:04.397 --> 58:05.564
I know some things too.

58:05.732 --> 58:09.234
Wait a minute. You know
what happens when a planet explodes.

58:09.402 --> 58:12.988
- Debris. Things floating in space.
- So?

58:13.198 --> 58:17.075
So all we have to do is find out
where in heaven Krypton used to be.

58:17.243 --> 58:20.204
Then we get good old Gus
to contact the Vulcan satellite.

58:20.413 --> 58:22.539
Old Gus has been doing some thinking.

58:22.707 --> 58:24.625
Good. That's why I keep you around.

58:25.084 --> 58:29.129
Yeah. I've been thinking that I'm not
making enough money for this gig.

58:29.756 --> 58:33.133
Gus, if there's anything I hate...

58:33.885 --> 58:35.093
...it's greed.

58:35.261 --> 58:38.388
Greed? Mr. Ross, just a minute.

58:38.598 --> 58:40.432
Let me tell you something.

58:40.934 --> 58:42.392
I can't ski!

59:14.968 --> 59:17.135
- Once Gus contacts
the Vulcan satellite...

59:17.303 --> 59:19.304
...he orders it to search
through space...

59:19.472 --> 59:22.266
...around where Krypton
went bye-bye.

59:31.734 --> 59:35.320
Then the laser probe locks
on to a floating chunk of Kryptonite.

59:35.488 --> 59:37.573
The computer analyzes
the components...

59:37.782 --> 59:41.076
...and the boys at the lab
duplicate the stuff down here.

59:41.661 --> 59:43.495
"Unknown"?

59:43.955 --> 59:45.497
"Unknown"?

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:04.850
What the hell,
he ain't gonna smoke it.

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:13.358
Mr. White can't be responsible.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:16.820
Where is he?

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.614
Please, Mr. Stokis.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.741
He'll pay for this.

01:00:22.243 --> 01:00:23.785
Get out your wallet!

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:28.040
- Good morning.
- Don't you "good morning" me.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.712
"Old, old relationships
suddenly seem very much the same.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.547
The prettiest girl in the school..."

01:00:37.383 --> 01:00:39.676
...is still the prettiest girl
in the school.

01:00:44.265 --> 01:00:47.517
- Hello?
- Hello. Oh, hi, Clark.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:52.272
Lana! Hi, I was just
thinking about you.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:53.815
Oh, um...

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:56.193
Listen, I have a problem with Ricky.

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:57.694
Why? What happened to Ricky?

01:00:57.862 --> 01:01:01.406
It's Superman's autograph you got him.
He got carried away...

01:01:01.574 --> 01:01:04.576
...and told the kids Superman
was coming on his birthday.

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.078
Okay, it was wrong...

01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:09.915
...but when Wednesday comes and
Superman doesn't show, it's gonna...

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:14.544
Well, Lana, in this case I think
I can go ahead and speak for Superman.

01:01:14.712 --> 01:01:16.797
I mean, he and I
are pretty close, you know.

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:21.051
And you can tell Ricky that Superman
will be there on Wednesday, all right?

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:26.223
Well, he's gonna get the best
home-cooked meal he's had...

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:27.766
...in a long time.

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:30.936
- Tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
- All right.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.230
- But, Clark...
- Yeah?

01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:34.940
...you're the best.

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:42.406
And I'll take it to
the Supreme Court if I have to.

01:01:42.615 --> 01:01:45.909
But it wasn't our fault.
It was an act of God.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:47.911
In a church?

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:01.633
Hey!

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.802
Here's that compound you ordered.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.887
Can't imagine what you want with it.

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:07.431
But you got it.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.648
What the hell am I afraid for?
I'm from Earth.

01:02:22.363 --> 01:02:24.489
Lana, I really wasn't expecting all this.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:27.284
I guess they did get
a little carried away.

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:44.384
Superman, we all know...

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:47.763
...that you're not looking
for honors and awards.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:52.184
But when we heard that you were
coming to see your pal Ricky...

01:02:52.393 --> 01:02:56.188
...we realized that this was
our chance to say thank you.

01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:58.774
First, for putting out
the Lake Comooga fire.

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:02.527
And not least,
for saving little Ricky.

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:05.697
So since you already have
the key to our hearts...

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:08.033
...Superman...

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:12.287
...may I present you
with the key to the city.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:13.872
Thank you, sir.

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:19.127
Thank you.

01:03:35.561 --> 01:03:37.229
As you were.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:41.566
Now listen up.

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.902
I just came in directly...

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.238
...from the Pentagon...

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:50.575
...and you better believe there's
a damn good reason that I did.

01:03:51.577 --> 01:03:53.912
Because God has given us...

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.582
...one of the greatest gifts in the world:

01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:59.709
Chemicals.

01:04:00.711 --> 01:04:05.340
Now, you people, you like to go sit
in church on Sunday, don't you?

01:04:05.716 --> 01:04:08.176
You like to sit and watch
the Super Bowl.

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:09.427
Yeah.

01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:11.680
Sit on what?!

01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:17.269
You sit on molded, plastic seats!

01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:21.606
Molded to your well-fed behinds.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:27.445
Now, I don't have to tell you
that America leads the world...

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:28.989
...in high-grade plastics.

01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:33.785
We cannot afford
a chemical-plastics gap.

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.246
Now, listen to me.

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:38.623
Do you want...

01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:43.211
...our president of the United States
sitting down...

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:45.964
...to write a peace treaty...

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:49.050
...and have his ballpoint pen bust open...

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.470
...and the ink run out all over
his nice, clean pants...

01:04:52.638 --> 01:04:54.472
...in front of the world leaders?

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.516
No. No.

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:58.810
Now, we all know...

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:03.315
...that last week, half of
this great nation of ours...

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.150
...almost bit the bullet...

01:05:05.818 --> 01:05:08.278
...if it wasn't for this man here.

01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:14.826
And all I can say is,
thank the Lord for Superman.

01:05:20.791 --> 01:05:22.918
Superman, you saved our bacon...

01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:25.420
...and I'd like to show our gratitude.

01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:32.928
This is a small token
of our appreciation...

01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:37.766
...to show to you for saving us
from a chemical-plant disaster.

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:45.690
Thank you very much, general.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:48.360
This is very nice. Thank you.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:00.830
It's very nice.

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:11.883
Unknown. How am I supposed
to know what "unknown" means?

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:15.178
It means unknown. It means
nobody knows what it means.

01:06:15.346 --> 01:06:17.555
- Hello, boss?
- Gus?

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:20.892
- Gus Gorman here.
- I know that. How did it go?

01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:25.188
You know how they're always
trying to find the secret recipe...

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:27.190
...in that chicken in the bucket?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.401
And nobody seems to know
the ingredient...

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:31.736
...because it's unknown, right?

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:36.741
In the Kryptonite there was an unknown
element and Superman didn't die.

01:06:37.618 --> 01:06:39.744
He didn't die.

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:43.081
I ask you to kill Superman...

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:47.419
...and you're telling me you couldn't
even do that one simple thing.

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:52.882
Hello?

01:07:06.772 --> 01:07:09.357
He hasn't had
an afternoon nap for years.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:13.236
This is the biggest day of his life.
I don't know how to thank you.

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:15.071
You did with that wonderful lunch.

01:07:15.239 --> 01:07:18.450
Oh, well, I do like to cook.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:21.453
- You'll take some coffee?
- Yes, please.

01:07:21.662 --> 01:07:23.788
- Decaffeinated, of course.
- Right.

01:07:28.794 --> 01:07:31.296
Hello? Yes.

01:07:32.965 --> 01:07:34.299
What?

01:07:34.675 --> 01:07:36.551
Oh, really?

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:37.969
Yeah, he's here.

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:40.138
I'll tell him.
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:43.266
Superman, that was my friend Betty.

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:46.978
There's an accident on the bridge.
A trailer crashed through the rail.

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:50.231
It's hanging off the bridge
and the driver's in the cab.

01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:53.193
I'm sorry.
I hate to make you rush off.

01:07:53.819 --> 01:07:55.153
Well, there's no rush.

01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:59.574
- But the bridge...
- It's okay. I always get there on time.

01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:01.451
Come on, let's relax a little.

01:08:15.299 --> 01:08:18.801
It's unusual finding a good-looking girl
like you alone like this.

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:34.359
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't
do something about the bridge?

01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:36.194
What bridge?

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:42.658
You're right.

01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:48.622
I have to get going.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.175
Get him out of there. Come on.

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.010
Get him out! Get him out quick!

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.888
Come on. Get him away.
That thing's gonna go.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:20.822
Everybody okay? Joe?

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:22.823
What can I do to help?

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:24.533
Not much of anything now.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:27.287
If only you'd got here
a minute sooner.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:45.198
"At a special session
of the General Assembly...

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:48.618
...178 countries voted
to censure Superman...

01:10:48.786 --> 01:10:51.246
...with only Colombia abstaining."

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:52.914
I can tell you one thing.

01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:56.960
He wasn't so mean and nasty
the other day in Smallville.

01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:59.587
In fact, he was so full of niceness...

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:02.131
...I hated laying that big chunk of...

01:11:03.842 --> 01:11:05.843
Kryptonite. Don't you see?

01:11:06.011 --> 01:11:09.347
That stuff we ran off in the lab
wasn't a complete failure after all.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:12.392
Right after Gus gave it to him,
he started to turn into...

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.686
...an ornery, evil, malicious, selfish...

01:11:14.895 --> 01:11:16.813
- A normal person.
- Yes.

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:20.942
And now that Superman
is out of the nice-guy business...

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.819
We can get to work on that oil.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:50.722
- And now, the supreme
moment, as the last runner...

01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:54.851
...the one given the great honor
of lighting the ceremonial flame...

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:59.147
...runs the last leg of a marathon
that began seven days ago...

01:11:59.356 --> 01:12:04.068
...as this torch has been passed
from athlete to athlete...

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:07.030
...for 970 miles...

01:12:07.197 --> 01:12:09.032
...across the country.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:53.493
How can he say that pure categories
have no objective meaning...

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:56.537
...in transcendental logic?
What about synthetic unity?

01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:01.167
Hi, honey! Am I in your way?

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:04.295
- Stick around, you may learn something.
- Hi, Lorelei.

01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:08.132
All the oil tankers in the world
are totally controlled by computers.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.177
They tell them where to go,
how much oil to pick up...

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:13.096
...and where to deliver it.

01:13:13.263 --> 01:13:15.139
Don't they have captains
on these ships?

01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:16.766
Yes, but they don't need them.

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:20.228
That's a throwback to some
sentimental, seafaring baloney.

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:24.107
- You will command the tankers
to sail toward a 50-mile area...

01:13:24.274 --> 01:13:26.150
...in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

01:13:26.318 --> 01:13:27.985
And do what?

01:13:28.153 --> 01:13:30.363
And do nothing.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:32.824
Just sit there.

01:13:33.992 --> 01:13:36.869
How are all the people
gonna get their oil?

01:13:38.038 --> 01:13:40.456
You catch on fast, old buddy.

01:13:43.168 --> 01:13:46.337
Every oil pump in America is run by...

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:49.298
- Computers. I know.
- Will you stop interrupting?!

01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:50.675
I'm sorry.

01:13:51.009 --> 01:13:54.804
You will command the pumps
to stop pumping.

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:58.891
- Then I want you to program
one special command...

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:01.185
...into all these systems.

01:14:01.353 --> 01:14:04.147
Tell them these orders
are irreversible.

01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:08.109
So it would be impossible
for anybody to switch them back.

01:14:08.318 --> 01:14:10.194
Can you do this for me, old buddy?

01:14:10.737 --> 01:14:12.613
Old pal?

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:22.373
You know, you get your way
all the time.

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:25.334
And it's not right.

01:14:27.754 --> 01:14:29.881
I wanna know when I get a taste.

01:14:36.346 --> 01:14:40.600
I think you've already had
a taste of freedom, haven't you?

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:43.352
Or would you prefer jail?

01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:45.396
You can't run that jail number on me.

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:49.317
Because I know I mean more to you
out here doing things for you...

01:14:49.526 --> 01:14:52.236
...than sitting in jail
doing nothing for nobody.

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:55.072
I see.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.074
What do you want?

01:15:03.415 --> 01:15:05.875
What? A wastebasket?

01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:08.211
No. These are plans.

01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:10.588
Blueprints.

01:15:11.131 --> 01:15:13.216
- For what?
- A computer.

01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:16.219
- We've already got computers.
- No, not like this.

01:15:16.386 --> 01:15:19.931
There's not a computer like this
in the whole world anyplace.

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:22.350
It doesn't exist. You see...

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:23.935
...we have to build it.

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:25.561
What will it do?

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:27.730
Anything I tell it.

01:15:28.273 --> 01:15:30.441
What will it do for me?

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:34.904
For you? It will do anything you
tell me to tell it to do for you.

01:15:35.155 --> 01:15:36.489
Wow.

01:15:41.286 --> 01:15:42.870
Tell me.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:48.084
- First of all, if anyone attacks
this machine or anything...

01:15:48.293 --> 01:15:50.169
...the computer counterattacks it.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:53.381
I mean, it finds their weaknesses
and wipes them out.

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:54.966
Right, old buddy.

01:15:55.175 --> 01:15:58.970
You deal with my oil
and I'll build you your machine.

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.308
Okay, I'll do it.

01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:08.020
But I'm not so sure about
this irreversible business.

01:16:25.163 --> 01:16:27.832
They all kind of went...
What the hell?

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.713
That's it. The last tanker.

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:37.341
They're all mine now. All mine.

01:16:37.884 --> 01:16:39.385
Yay.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.846
Not quite.

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:44.515
What's that in
the upper-middle quadrant?

01:16:45.517 --> 01:16:47.018
It's a tanker.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:51.063
And it's going the wrong way.

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:03.034
Skipper?

01:17:03.201 --> 01:17:05.870
There it is again.
"Proceed immediately to...

01:17:06.079 --> 01:17:09.165
...latitude 30 north, longitude 45 west.

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:12.543
There await further orders."

01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:14.879
Hell, that's the middle of the Atlantic.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:17.965
I'm not taking my ship there
just to await further orders...

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:19.717
...no matter what that says.

01:17:19.926 --> 01:17:23.554
We're supposed to go to Metropolis,
and we're going to Metropolis.

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:25.014
All right.

01:17:37.402 --> 01:17:38.736
That's where she is. Yeah.

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:40.988
Come on, get it up there.

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:43.783
OFFICER:
Miss?

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.577
Miss, can you hear me?

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:49.413
Listen, we are here to help you.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:53.084
Don't jump. I repeat, do not jump!

01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:56.087
Thought you'd never get here.

01:17:56.963 --> 01:17:59.715
Don't expect me to save you.
I don't do that anymore.

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:01.008
Don't worry.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.928
I'm long past saving.

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:10.267
Well...

01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:12.770
...don't let me keep you
from anything.

01:18:13.438 --> 01:18:15.022
I'm not in a rush.

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.822
What did you have in mind?

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:24.782
Lots of things.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.242
Oh, yeah?

01:18:27.744 --> 01:18:29.078
Ooo...

01:18:29.329 --> 01:18:32.248
If you'll just do me
one little favor first.

01:18:32.457 --> 01:18:33.791
What's that?

01:18:34.292 --> 01:18:36.043
Well...

01:18:36.586 --> 01:18:38.796
See, there's this little boat...

01:18:39.005 --> 01:18:42.717
...and it's not going where
it's supposed to go and...

01:19:19.337 --> 01:19:21.005
Stop all engines!

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.674
Stop all engines!

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:18.562
Hi.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.539
How about a little après-ski?

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:48.926
Champagne?

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.535
Take your turn like everybody else!

01:21:14.744 --> 01:21:16.787
Stop it!

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.584
He's coming over here, Martha.

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.547
Don't you do that!

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:30.217
Don't! Please!

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:38.392
Hit him with your handbag!

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.316
Help me! Please, help me.
Somebody's beating up my husband.

01:21:45.483 --> 01:21:49.111
- I've gotta call the police.
- Jack, go with her, okay?

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:52.656
The third one today,
and at night it's worse.

01:21:52.866 --> 01:21:54.658
Somebody's behind this.

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:56.619
You can't tell me there's no oil.

01:21:56.786 --> 01:21:59.163
You can't say someone's
not getting rich off this.

01:21:59.372 --> 01:22:01.206
Someone's always getting rich.

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:03.417
You know who suffers? The small guy.

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:06.837
- The East Coast gets
the brunt of the spill.

01:22:49.547 --> 01:22:52.091
No, I cannot go out with you tonight.

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:54.093
No. I'm busy tomorrow night too.

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.053
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:58.305
I'll think of something. Look...

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:01.684
- ... I gotta go. Ricky needs me.
- Lana.

01:23:01.851 --> 01:23:04.979
Brad, please stop calling me.
I've told you!

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:07.231
Well, you listen to me, huh?

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:09.400
You better start appreciating old Brad.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.360
What else you got in Smallville?

01:23:17.283 --> 01:23:19.827
What else have I got in Smallville?

01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:23.372
I think I got the right answer.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.416
So do I.

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:38.220
Smallville Airport, what flights
do you have to Metropolis tomorrow?

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:46.395
- Where do I put this?
- Over there.

01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:51.150
- Where do you want this?
- Put it up there.

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:57.281
Are you kidding? I'm not going in there.

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:20.637
Hey, hey. Come on.

01:24:29.147 --> 01:24:30.314
Just leave him alone.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:54.213
I can't get through.
Something's happening.

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:56.215
Hey, look! Superman's drunk!

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:59.510
- I wanna see what's happening here.
- Ricky. Ricky!

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:03.013
- Ricky.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:25:03.556 --> 01:25:05.849
- Thank you.
- It's a disgrace, that's what it is.

01:25:06.017 --> 01:25:08.852
I'll tell you, nobody's ever
gonna trust that creep again.

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:10.479
He's washed up.

01:25:13.983 --> 01:25:16.693
What are you looking at? Huh?

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:20.280
Excuse me. Superman? It's me, Ricky.

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:22.157
Ricky from Smallville.

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:24.118
Tell them you won't hurt anybody!

01:25:24.327 --> 01:25:25.494
He's changed.

01:25:25.662 --> 01:25:28.330
No! Maybe he's just sick.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.374
Superman, please get better!

01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:32.042
He's not listening to you.

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:36.046
Yes, he is. He can hear me.
He's got super-hearing.

01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:38.841
Superman, you're just in a slump!

01:25:39.008 --> 01:25:40.759
You'll be great again!

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.469
You can do it, Superman!

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:45.639
Superman, you can hear me, can't you?

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:48.392
Superman, you're just in a slump.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.187
You'll be great again.
You can do it, Superman.

01:25:52.355 --> 01:25:55.399
Superman, you can hear me, can't you?

01:26:15.587 --> 01:26:16.628
He's gone nuts!

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:19.548
Come on!

01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:48.470
I can give as good as I get.

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:52.599
Oh, yeah? All right, come on! Come on!

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:54.518
Come on! Come on!

01:28:20.003 --> 01:28:22.629
What's the matter, Kent?
Too warm for you, huh?

01:28:24.757 --> 01:28:27.551
Come on, chicken! Come and get me.

01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:30.012
You've been on my nerves a long time!

01:28:51.909 --> 01:28:53.994
You always wanted to fly, Kent.

01:28:54.203 --> 01:28:55.412
Now's your chance.

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:51.041
Skipper!

01:34:05.681 --> 01:34:08.058
God, would you look at that!

01:34:55.481 --> 01:34:58.108
- Miss Lorelei Ambrosia
isn't at home right now.

01:34:58.317 --> 01:35:00.527
But if you'd care to leave a message...

01:35:00.736 --> 01:35:04.114
...why not deliver it to her in person?

01:35:04.281 --> 01:35:07.659
So you've finally shown
your true colors.

01:35:07.868 --> 01:35:12.122
Well, if you're looking for us,
here's where you'll find us.

01:35:12.331 --> 01:35:14.040
Do drop in.

01:35:20.631 --> 01:35:22.298
Wow, this is fun!

01:35:22.717 --> 01:35:24.759
Fun? The fun's just starting.

01:35:25.344 --> 01:35:28.179
Wait till Superman finds us,
then you'll see some fun.

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.765
Wait, you gonna mess with Superman?

01:35:31.058 --> 01:35:35.061
- Let's go. I want to be ready for him
when he falls into our trap.

01:35:35.354 --> 01:35:39.190
I just don't see why you can't
balloon down like the rest of us.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.483
Well...

01:35:42.319 --> 01:35:43.445
No way.

01:35:43.654 --> 01:35:46.156
I just don't believe a man can fly.

01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:05.341
Watch out, horsy!

01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.187
Don't, don't, don't.

01:36:17.354 --> 01:36:19.773
Just don't try to fly.

01:36:20.024 --> 01:36:21.483
Don't try to fly!

01:36:34.705 --> 01:36:37.165
Will you get out of my way!

01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:58.311
- Hurry! Hurry up!
- I am hurrying.

01:37:03.901 --> 01:37:06.194
- I can't see anything.
- Turn on the light.

01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:09.113
- Where's the light switch?
- Where do you usually find it?

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:11.616
- I don't know.
I guess I'll check the doorway.

01:37:11.826 --> 01:37:15.703
God, it's pitch-black in here.
Oh, that's better.

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:21.918
Wow, what a jukebox!

01:37:22.086 --> 01:37:24.045
I told you, didn't I?

01:37:24.213 --> 01:37:26.506
There. The ultimate computer!

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:37.433
It does everything a computer can do
and 1000 things none of them can do.

01:37:37.643 --> 01:37:39.060
Let's give it a dry run.

01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:41.187
- Wait a minute.
We've gotta wait for Gus.

01:37:41.397 --> 01:37:42.689
Who needs Gus?

01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:46.234
- He's the only one who can operate it.
- Like fish he is!

01:37:46.443 --> 01:37:49.654
I know enough about computers
to put a Ph. D. to shame.

01:37:49.864 --> 01:37:52.407
Come now, brother dear,
you didn't think...

01:37:52.575 --> 01:37:55.285
...I was gonna let that little man
run the show, did you?

01:37:55.661 --> 01:37:57.704
Why don't peons tidy up
when they're done?

01:37:57.913 --> 01:38:00.707
Come on, Bubba, it's showtime.

01:38:04.128 --> 01:38:06.796
Engage those buttons
to activate the alpha circuit...

01:38:07.006 --> 01:38:08.381
...and lock the modular grid.

01:38:08.591 --> 01:38:13.469
You! Activate circuits 29 through W-7...

01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:17.765
...and start full-power coordinates
on exterior defensive systems.

01:38:17.975 --> 01:38:20.852
In other words, push this red button.

01:38:21.687 --> 01:38:23.688
How did you know about that?

01:38:41.624 --> 01:38:42.665
He's here!

01:38:42.833 --> 01:38:45.835
- Good. Let's give him
something to worry about.

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:48.379
Now, let's see...

01:38:48.839 --> 01:38:51.215
Tracking systems locked.

01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.701
Let the games begin.

01:39:19.703 --> 01:39:21.329
Don't tense up now, honey.

01:39:53.862 --> 01:39:56.739
- Come on, Bubba,
you're wasting your rockets.

01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:06.249
Come on, Superman!

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:09.210
Let him have it, Ross.

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:17.927
Bubba, keep firing.

01:40:18.095 --> 01:40:20.763
Keep him occupied
while I get the MX ready.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.209
What the hell is going on?

01:40:58.302 --> 01:41:01.971
- You keep your rockets coming.
He won't notice the missile till too late!

01:41:10.147 --> 01:41:12.315
So much for your catlike reflexes.

01:41:22.785 --> 01:41:24.368
Oh, God!

01:41:25.704 --> 01:41:27.246
Ha, ha!

01:41:34.338 --> 01:41:37.298
No more. Look, you sit.

01:41:37.508 --> 01:41:39.300
Sit, sit!

01:41:43.013 --> 01:41:44.138
Help!

01:41:44.848 --> 01:41:48.017
Hello? Forget you, jackass!

01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:50.603
That's him out of the way.

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:54.857
Sis, how would you like to control
all the world's weapons systems?

01:41:55.734 --> 01:41:56.943
Baby!

01:41:57.152 --> 01:41:58.611
It's Daddy!

01:41:59.696 --> 01:42:01.864
Hey, what are you doing with my baby?

01:42:02.324 --> 01:42:06.494
Gus, old buddy, genius.
Come up and join the fun.

01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:20.967
He's still coming.
Arm the inner defenses.

01:42:25.389 --> 01:42:26.889
All right, the game's over.

01:42:27.558 --> 01:42:28.599
Hi, honey.

01:42:29.143 --> 01:42:30.309
I don't know you, lady.

01:42:32.354 --> 01:42:33.563
But the other night...

01:42:36.191 --> 01:42:38.401
I'm sorry, but that wasn't me.

01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:39.902
That guy's gone.

01:42:41.697 --> 01:42:43.156
And you're next, Webster.

01:42:44.283 --> 01:42:47.702
- Never underestimate
the power of computers.

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:49.328
How do you like it?

01:42:49.538 --> 01:42:52.081
- I think it's typical
of people like you, Webster.

01:42:52.374 --> 01:42:55.751
Instead of helping others, the four
of you just wanna help yourselves.

01:42:55.919 --> 01:42:58.254
Four of you?

01:42:58.422 --> 01:43:00.548
You mean, us? Four? Wait...

01:43:00.757 --> 01:43:02.425
Hey, man!

01:43:02.593 --> 01:43:06.262
That's only his last name.
He likes to be called "Superman."

01:43:07.055 --> 01:43:09.682
See, I'm not with them, Superman.

01:43:10.267 --> 01:43:11.684
You could've fooled me, mister.

01:43:20.027 --> 01:43:21.527
That's very good.

01:43:23.989 --> 01:43:27.491
- Let's see how long
he can carry on without any air.

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.599
He's still coming!
He's going to get me!

01:43:51.767 --> 01:43:52.892
Don't bet on it!

01:44:05.572 --> 01:44:06.948
You're hurting him.

01:44:11.036 --> 01:44:13.120
- That's Kryptonite!
- Yes.

01:44:13.288 --> 01:44:15.831
- This time we got it right!
- You're a genius.

01:44:16.375 --> 01:44:19.961
You've invented a machine
that can find anybody's weak spot.

01:44:20.462 --> 01:44:22.004
Congratulations, old buddy.

01:44:22.172 --> 01:44:25.424
You'll go down in history
as the man who killed Superman!

01:44:25.634 --> 01:44:26.842
I'm... No.

01:44:27.552 --> 01:44:28.844
Superman!

01:44:29.012 --> 01:44:30.596
No!

01:44:31.139 --> 01:44:33.432
- Where do you think you're going?
- Never mind.

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.519
- Turn the power up.
- Hasn't he had enough?

01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:41.649
Turn it up!

01:44:41.817 --> 01:44:43.943
Power! More power!

01:44:48.407 --> 01:44:50.283
Whoa!

01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:56.622
Ow!

01:45:05.382 --> 01:45:08.050
Seventy-five. Current 7.75.

01:45:12.139 --> 01:45:16.892
There's a current level of 7
that is not supposed to be on bar...

01:45:17.102 --> 01:45:18.686
Oh, here it is!

01:45:45.339 --> 01:45:46.380
What's going on?

01:45:47.257 --> 01:45:49.091
I don't know. The power's gone.

01:45:49.551 --> 01:45:51.427
Gus must have pulled the plug out.

01:45:51.928 --> 01:45:53.387
It worked.

01:45:53.597 --> 01:45:55.931
It worked! I got it!

01:45:59.936 --> 01:46:01.437
What have you got?

01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:05.691
- Give me that screw.
- This screw?

01:46:05.901 --> 01:46:08.027
- That screw.
- Never!

01:46:12.449 --> 01:46:14.950
Hey, wait. I can't see.

01:46:37.516 --> 01:46:38.641
What?

01:46:41.478 --> 01:46:42.937
Holy...!

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.648
No! Make it stop!

01:46:47.275 --> 01:46:48.734
I can't! It's out of control!

01:46:48.944 --> 01:46:52.113
But how? Where's it getting
the power from?

01:46:55.659 --> 01:46:57.868
It's feeding itself.

01:46:58.078 --> 01:46:59.328
It wants to live!

01:47:22.227 --> 01:47:24.395
It's this thing here. We'll go to the zoo.

01:47:24.604 --> 01:47:27.857
I'll do that tomorrow,
and then we'll go on to the...

01:47:28.984 --> 01:47:31.527
- What's happening?
- It's okay, Ricky.

01:47:31.778 --> 01:47:32.945
Put the lights on!

01:47:52.883 --> 01:47:54.925
Stop it! You're killing him!

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.095
Stop it!

01:48:10.567 --> 01:48:11.984
Hey. Put me down!

01:48:29.252 --> 01:48:32.338
Don't leave us alone in here! Superman!

01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:37.801
Oh, I get it.

01:48:37.969 --> 01:48:41.555
The coaxial energy shaft is engaging
the grid source factor. Right.

01:48:41.765 --> 01:48:43.599
We're through, frogface.
I'm splitting.

01:48:43.767 --> 01:48:45.351
Hey, wait a minute!

01:48:47.896 --> 01:48:50.564
Girls. Girls, come out of there!

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:02.451
Help me! Please!

01:49:09.125 --> 01:49:10.251
Sis?

01:49:14.089 --> 01:49:15.381
Oh, my God.

01:49:22.973 --> 01:49:24.265
What is that?

01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:37.111
Lorelei!

01:49:39.656 --> 01:49:41.824
Sis, it's your Bubba!

01:50:19.863 --> 01:50:21.530
Help me. Help!

01:50:23.742 --> 01:50:25.034
Superman!

01:50:28.121 --> 01:50:29.204
Honey!

01:50:29.372 --> 01:50:33.250
Honey, I'm stuck here! Help!
What about me?

01:50:44.387 --> 01:50:45.429
Look out!

01:52:54.768 --> 01:52:55.976
Bubba?

01:53:42.315 --> 01:53:44.066
Thank you, brother.

01:53:51.074 --> 01:53:52.783
Regular or premium?

01:53:52.992 --> 01:53:57.079
She hasn't had a drink in so long,
give her a tankful of the good stuff.

01:53:58.998 --> 01:54:00.040
How you doing?

01:54:00.208 --> 01:54:03.293
Please don't talk to me.
I'm having enough trouble hanging on.

01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:06.255
Okay, we'll go slow.
You're perfectly safe.

01:54:06.881 --> 01:54:08.298
I'm not gonna argue with you.

01:54:08.466 --> 01:54:11.593
I mean, any man who can trick
my machine can do anything.

01:54:11.761 --> 01:54:13.470
How did you beat my defenses?

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:17.099
Those defenses are good as long
as it didn't know it's in trouble.

01:54:17.308 --> 01:54:20.811
This time it didn't see the danger.
I went in with plain old acid.

01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:24.648
It didn't know that when acid gets hot,
it'll eat through anything.

01:54:25.191 --> 01:54:26.775
- Watch the trees.
- Whoa!

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:30.445
I guess it died of acid indigestion.

01:54:31.698 --> 01:54:34.283
But what's gonna happen
to Ross and the ladies?

01:54:34.450 --> 01:54:37.995
They're gonna have to see the police.
It's not your problem anymore.

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:41.081
Are we in Metropolis yet?

01:54:41.291 --> 01:54:44.376
Nope. We're just gonna make
a little stop right over there.

01:54:44.586 --> 01:54:46.503
Whoa!

01:54:52.051 --> 01:54:54.595
We're on the ground, Gus.
Morning.

01:54:54.762 --> 01:54:56.763
- You okay, Supe?
- I'm fine.

01:54:56.973 --> 01:54:58.140
Excuse me a second.

01:55:02.478 --> 01:55:04.271
Can you guys spare one of these?

01:55:05.148 --> 01:55:07.858
- Sure, Superman.
- It is Superman, isn't it?

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:10.068
Are you kidding? Is that...?

01:55:10.278 --> 01:55:12.988
Didn't you see us fly out of the sky?

01:55:14.198 --> 01:55:18.785
We're the only two men who can fly.
"Is it Superman?"

01:55:18.995 --> 01:55:20.495
Just right.

01:55:21.331 --> 01:55:22.372
Okay, Gus, let's go.

01:55:22.582 --> 01:55:25.667
I was afraid you'd say that.
I thought I'd take the bus.

01:55:26.169 --> 01:55:29.504
Well, suit yourself.
Does your boss have a computer here?

01:55:29.839 --> 01:55:32.758
Yeah, he got a little bitty one
about that big.

01:55:32.926 --> 01:55:36.595
You tell him he can do a lot worse
than to give Gus Gorman here a job.

01:55:38.848 --> 01:55:40.432
Wow, thank you, Supe.

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:41.808
Take care.

01:55:43.686 --> 01:55:45.187
I'll see you around.

01:55:51.277 --> 01:55:52.361
So long.

01:55:55.406 --> 01:55:57.115
Take it easy, man.

01:55:58.493 --> 01:56:02.704
Well, you got good references,
so if you want that job...

01:56:06.751 --> 01:56:09.544
Nah, this is not for me.
I think I'll take that bus.

01:56:09.712 --> 01:56:11.630
Can you tell me
where the bus station is?

01:56:11.839 --> 01:56:14.424
Yeah, about nine, 10 miles over there.

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:19.096
Nine or 10 miles. Okay.

01:56:19.263 --> 01:56:21.348
Hey. You really flew with him?

01:56:21.516 --> 01:56:24.559
Superman? Have you ever
seen Superman before?

01:56:26.562 --> 01:56:27.604
No.

01:56:27.897 --> 01:56:31.400
Oh, you don't know about me and him?
Me and Superman?

01:56:36.572 --> 01:56:38.907
Yeah, we go way back together.

01:56:39.075 --> 01:56:41.743
We always, usually, sometimes, we...

01:56:43.204 --> 01:56:44.955
Nine or 10 miles?

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:47.416
I think I'll walk.

01:56:47.792 --> 01:56:49.209
Yeah, I'll walk.

01:56:49.794 --> 01:56:51.003
Yeah.

01:56:56.050 --> 01:56:57.259
Clark.

01:56:57.593 --> 01:57:00.595
What a nice surprise! Come in.

01:57:00.763 --> 01:57:02.347
- Gosh. Hi, Mr. Kent.
- Hi, Ricky.

01:57:02.515 --> 01:57:05.017
- Guess who Mom's having dinner with.
- Who?

01:57:05.226 --> 01:57:06.601
Superman!

01:57:07.145 --> 01:57:09.354
Yeah, that's what I came to tell you.

01:57:09.564 --> 01:57:11.440
Superman said to tell you he's sorry...

01:57:11.649 --> 01:57:15.318
...but he's run into a problem and he
won't be able to have dinner with you.

01:57:15.486 --> 01:57:17.779
- I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
- Yeah.

01:57:18.948 --> 01:57:20.824
Would you mind settling for me?

01:57:21.034 --> 01:57:22.284
Any day.

01:57:23.161 --> 01:57:24.494
- I'll get my things.
- Okay.

01:57:26.414 --> 01:57:29.916
You know, Lana, I was talking
to Superman the other day.

01:57:30.126 --> 01:57:33.879
You know, he and I, we talk a lot.

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:37.716
And he felt badly about you having
to pawn your diamond ring.

01:57:40.803 --> 01:57:42.304
Well, he found...

01:57:43.514 --> 01:57:46.725
He found this one just lying around.

01:57:48.019 --> 01:57:50.479
He wanted you to have this.

01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:59.279
Wow, a ring from Superman!

01:58:00.448 --> 01:58:02.240
- It's okay. I got it.
- Sorry.

01:58:02.408 --> 01:58:03.825
Look at that.

01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:06.995
- Oh, Clark.
- It's okay.

01:58:07.205 --> 01:58:08.497
It fits.

01:58:08.998 --> 01:58:10.332
It looks really pretty.

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:11.875
Thank you.

01:58:12.919 --> 01:58:14.586
Well...

01:58:14.754 --> 01:58:15.837
- Brad.
- Brad.

01:58:16.297 --> 01:58:17.339
Son of a bitch.

01:58:19.175 --> 01:58:21.093
Kent, I hate you.

01:58:22.011 --> 01:58:23.929
I've always hated you.

01:58:24.472 --> 01:58:26.223
- You know why?
- No.

01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:28.016
- Because you're nice.
- Not really.

01:58:28.226 --> 01:58:29.684
And nice guys finish last.

01:58:41.489 --> 01:58:43.115
Lois, I've got to hand it to you.

01:58:43.324 --> 01:58:45.700
Who else could turn
a vacation into a story...

01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:48.870
...that'll blow the lid off
of corruption in the Caribbean?

01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:52.374
I knew I was on to something
when that taxi driver kidnapped me.

01:58:52.583 --> 01:58:54.584
Lois, you're terrific.

01:58:54.794 --> 01:58:58.171
I have to be. Seems I've got
some new competition.

01:58:58.381 --> 01:58:59.756
Hmm?

01:59:00.091 --> 01:59:02.634
The story that you wrote
on the class reunion?

01:59:02.844 --> 01:59:04.636
- I thought it was terrific.
- Thanks.

01:59:04.804 --> 01:59:08.431
And fascinating. I liked the part
about the little girl back home.

01:59:08.599 --> 01:59:10.892
I'll take you to lunch
and you tell me about it.

01:59:11.727 --> 01:59:15.021
I'd love to, but I'm having lunch
with Mr. White's new secretary.

01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:16.231
- Hi, Lana.
- Hi, Clark.

01:59:16.399 --> 01:59:20.735
Lana. Lois, say hello to Lana Lang,
Smallville's newest gift to Metropolis.

01:59:20.903 --> 01:59:23.363
I'm glad to meet you.
I like your writing a lot.

01:59:23.739 --> 01:59:24.823
Thank you.

01:59:25.783 --> 01:59:27.117
I like your sparkler a lot.

01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:30.245
Me too. I couldn't believe it
when Clark gave it to me.

01:59:31.747 --> 01:59:33.874
- Clark gave it to you?
- Yes.

01:59:36.586 --> 01:59:37.961
Mr. White.

01:59:38.171 --> 01:59:41.298
Mr. White, look what I've got for you.

01:59:41.507 --> 01:59:44.426
People, I am in love with this machine!

01:59:44.594 --> 01:59:49.222
Mr. White, excuse me, but I have
a couple of errands to run before lunch.

01:59:49.432 --> 01:59:52.142
- Go ahead, Mr. White.
- Where's the handle?

01:59:52.351 --> 01:59:55.604
There is no handle.
You just push the button.
