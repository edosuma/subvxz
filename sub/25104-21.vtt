WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.235
Only on Fox.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.073
Narrator:
Tonight,

00:06.106 --> 00:07.708
three culinary legends...

00:07.741 --> 00:09.376
Aarón: Jonathan Waxman.

00:09.409 --> 00:10.711
Gordon: Daniel Boulud.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.980
And I'm lucky enough
to call her Mom,

00:13.013 --> 00:14.481
Lidia Bastianich.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.316
This is crazy!

00:16.349 --> 00:17.918
...take over the competition.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.588
Do not overcook
your proteins!

00:20.621 --> 00:22.322
Samantha: Lidia Bastianich?

00:22.355 --> 00:24.892
Our dishes better
be absolutely perfect.

00:24.925 --> 00:28.428
Narrator: The home cooks fight
for a spot in the final three,

00:28.461 --> 00:32.465
and a chance to become
America's next MasterChef.

00:41.642 --> 00:44.277
Samantha:
Semifinals!

00:44.311 --> 00:46.046
When I first walked
in this competition,

00:46.079 --> 00:48.115
I was a sorority girl
from Iowa,

00:48.148 --> 00:50.450
and now I'm a semifinalist.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.753
Welcome back
to the MasterChef kitchen.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.054
Gerron:
Top four, baby!

00:54.087 --> 00:56.624
I'm feeling real blessed
right now.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.626
I could be
in my classroom teaching,

00:58.659 --> 01:00.728
or chilling with my fiancée
right now,

01:00.761 --> 01:02.395
but I know I'm here
for a reason.

01:02.429 --> 01:04.031
My culinary dream is to be

01:04.064 --> 01:05.465
an international restaurateur,

01:05.498 --> 01:08.301
so of course,
winning the trophy,

01:08.335 --> 01:10.203
the title, the money,

01:10.237 --> 01:14.207
means I would have the
resources to pursue my dreams.

01:14.241 --> 01:17.911
I'm still the last apron
standing for Chef Aarón Sánchez,

01:17.945 --> 01:22.115
so I want to win this
competition to make Chef Aarón
even more proud of me.

01:22.149 --> 01:25.585
Congratulations.
You've made it to the top four

01:25.619 --> 01:29.322
of the biggest
cooking competition
in the entire world.

01:29.356 --> 01:30.924
To make it to the finale,

01:30.958 --> 01:33.927
you have to get through
tonight's tough challenges.

01:33.961 --> 01:36.163
To begin with tonight,

01:36.196 --> 01:38.999
you'll be cooking
in two teams of two.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.433
Yes.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.470
If your team of two
wins this challenge,

01:43.503 --> 01:48.341
your team will be
moving straight to
the MasterChef finale.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.310
Lose this team challenge,

01:50.343 --> 01:53.146
and you'll be going head to head
against your teammate

01:53.180 --> 01:55.816
for the final spot
in that finale.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.851
- Oh, God.
- Joe: Cesar.

01:57.885 --> 02:01.288
Because you have
the most number
of mystery box wins,

02:01.321 --> 02:04.191
you will decide the teams

02:04.224 --> 02:07.127
for everybody in this challenge.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.062
Please go stand
on the sideline.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.933
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.036
Young man,
time to pick your team.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.005
I want someone
who can carry their weight,

02:18.038 --> 02:21.474
who's on a hot streak
and can help me
get to the finale.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.013
I'm gonna go with Ashley.

02:26.046 --> 02:28.548
I wanted to be partners
with Cesar

02:28.581 --> 02:33.386
because my Caribbean vibe
and Cesar's Mexican flavors

02:33.420 --> 02:37.290
can really be a beautiful
symphony of flavors
on a plate.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.993
This is a big moment for you,

02:40.027 --> 02:45.065
but it's an even bigger
occasion for us.

02:45.098 --> 02:50.537
Because tonight,
you'll be cooking for
and judged by

02:50.570 --> 02:53.874
the chefs who've been mentors

02:53.907 --> 02:55.375
to your mentors.

02:57.510 --> 03:01.414
This chef has entirely changed
the landscape of food

03:01.448 --> 03:04.985
as one of the pioneers
of California cuisine.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.586
( whispers )
This is crazy.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.555
Please welcome my mentor...

03:09.589 --> 03:11.424
...Jonathan Waxman.

03:11.458 --> 03:14.094
( squeals )

03:14.127 --> 03:16.163
Wow!

03:16.196 --> 03:17.998
- Jonathan: Hello, guys.
- Home cooks: Hi.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.666
Aarón: He has mentored
not only myself,

03:19.699 --> 03:21.869
but countless chefs,
so this is such a treat for us.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.337
- Thank you, Chef.
- Oh, my God.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.273
Joe:
My mentor taught me

03:26.306 --> 03:28.008
everything I know.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.411
She is a hugely successful
restaurateur

03:31.444 --> 03:33.446
and Emmy award-winning
TV host.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.449
Most people call her Boss.

03:36.483 --> 03:39.352
I'm lucky enough
to call her Mom.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.954
Oh, my God!

03:40.988 --> 03:42.122
- Please welcome...
- ( laughter, applause )

03:42.155 --> 03:44.424
...my mom,
Lidia Bastianich.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.526
- Wow!
- ( applause )

03:46.559 --> 03:49.062
- Nice to see you, darling.
Welcome.
- Oh, my goodness.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.899
This is out of this world.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.466
- All right.
- ( whistles )

03:53.500 --> 03:56.303
Gordon: My mentor left France
for New York City,

03:56.336 --> 03:59.372
and transformed
French cuisine in America.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.075
Please welcome Daniel Boulud.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.410
( applause )

04:03.443 --> 04:04.411
- Whoa.
- ( squeals )

04:04.444 --> 04:06.146
This is crazy!

04:06.179 --> 04:07.447
( indistinct greetings )

04:07.480 --> 04:09.082
- Welcome. Welcome back.
- Merci.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.084
Daniel:
Pleased to meet them.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.921
Congratulations on the journey
up to here.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.388
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.425
First, Jonathan Waxman,
then Lidia Bastianich,

04:18.458 --> 04:20.894
and now Daniel Boulud.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.430
- No pressure, home cooks.
- ( laughter )

04:23.463 --> 04:25.498
Samantha:
I am blown away

04:25.532 --> 04:27.467
because they mentored
our mentors,

04:27.500 --> 04:30.838
and like, our mentors
are seen as culinary gods.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.841
So these guys are like
the culinary titans.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.810
We have got to make
our mentors look good.

04:36.844 --> 04:40.313
You four, if you thought
that we were tough to impress,

04:40.347 --> 04:43.316
these three giants
are real stars

04:43.350 --> 04:44.517
of the culinary world,
let me tell you.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.520
And tonight,
for this team challenge,

04:47.554 --> 04:50.490
the judging and
the decision making

04:50.523 --> 04:56.029
will be left entirely
to these three.

04:56.063 --> 04:59.833
We'll be watching from
the safety of the balcony,
every move.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.369
- Jonathan: Thank you.
- Lidia: Thank you.

05:02.402 --> 05:05.805
- Wow.
- This is the coolest
night ever.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.275
Jonathan:
Okay, home cooks,
you must be wondering

05:08.308 --> 05:10.878
what exactly
you are cooking tonight.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.213
- Yes.
- Daniel: We want to see you

05:13.246 --> 05:16.149
at your absolute best.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.886
Lidia: So tonight,
you'll all be making...

05:21.922 --> 05:23.690
...whatever dish you like.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.462
Lidia:
You will have access

05:29.496 --> 05:32.832
to the fully-stocked
MasterChef pantry.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.834
You have 60 minutes

05:34.868 --> 05:37.871
to make three identical plates.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.339
Work together.

05:39.372 --> 05:43.676
You need to be both represented
on that plate.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.845
Daniel:
Your 60 minutes start...

05:47.714 --> 05:48.949
- ...now.
- Samantha: Go!

05:52.385 --> 05:53.921
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.522
- What are you thinking?
- Oh...

05:55.555 --> 05:57.724
My favorite protein
is pork, so...

05:57.757 --> 05:59.192
A good bone-in pork chop?

05:59.226 --> 06:01.494
I think we gotta incorporate
that rhubarb somehow.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.263
Gerron: Rhubarb goes
good with lamb.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.332
- Okay, yeah. I like the idea.
- Let's do a lamb chop.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.400
- What kind of flavors
do you like?
- Tropical flavors.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.835
- Okay.
- Just, like, citrus-forward.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.103
We need to find
some type of fruit

06:10.137 --> 06:11.371
that goes good
with the rhubarb.

06:11.404 --> 06:12.940
What about
those blood oranges?

06:12.973 --> 06:14.274
- Samantha: Yeah.
- Ashley: Plantain chip.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.742
Ooh, that'd be cool.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.410
What you think about
getting some of these tomatoes

06:17.444 --> 06:19.947
- and doing ratatouille?
- Ooh, I like that.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.349
Let's make this happen.
All righty.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.383
- All right, let's do it.
- Gimme some, baby.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.118
Let's get it.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.287
- Mustard.
- Samantha: One or two?

06:27.320 --> 06:28.956
- Just grab a handful.
- You got your peppers
and everything?

06:28.989 --> 06:30.523
Yep.
All right, let's go, Ash.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.092
Gerron:
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.360
- Let's go, guys.
- Come on, hurry up!

06:33.393 --> 06:34.962
Hurry up!
Let's go.

06:36.263 --> 06:38.298
- I got lamb here.
- Samantha: Yep.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.567
- Remember we gotta
move fast, Gerron.
- Gerron: Yes.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.136
- Getting the brining liquid
started right now.
- Okay.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.939
We have to win
'cause I don't want to
go up against you, all right?

06:45.973 --> 06:48.308
I don't want to go
against you either
until it's the finale!

06:48.341 --> 06:51.144
So, Lidia, Daniel,

06:51.178 --> 06:53.947
these two teams have to make
three identical dishes.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.248
What are we looking for here?

06:55.282 --> 06:56.449
We like, first of all,

06:56.483 --> 06:58.085
the presentation
to be beautiful.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.153
- My glaze is looking good.
- Let me taste it now.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.322
Then of course, the harmony
of the different flavors.

07:02.355 --> 07:05.158
Make an example
in front of our mentors, please.

07:05.192 --> 07:08.228
And I think what differentiate
a cook from another

07:08.261 --> 07:12.565
is nuances in technique,
nuances in seasoning.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.667
I'm getting the spices
for the rub toasted.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.636
- Okay, perfect.
- They need to talk
to each other...

07:16.669 --> 07:17.937
We just really gotta
pick up the pace.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.672
Do you have those pans
heating up?

07:19.706 --> 07:21.574
- They're heating up right now.
- ...taste with each other.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.077
That communication
in the kitchen

07:24.111 --> 07:26.146
- really is underestimated.
- You looking good?

07:26.179 --> 07:27.480
- Yeah.
- All right.

07:27.514 --> 07:28.915
Damn, I dropped thyme
on the floor.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.650
Gerron, please, someone
take control there, yes?

07:30.683 --> 07:32.585
- Yes, Chef.
- And Samantha?

07:32.619 --> 07:34.121
- Yes, Chef.
- Try to work tidy,
will you please?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.622
- Okay, yeah.
- How you doing, you good?

07:35.655 --> 07:37.257
We just gotta get up
to that balcony, Gerron.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.591
- It's okay, Sam.
- We have got to.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.859
Gerron:
Just don't panic, okay?

07:39.892 --> 07:41.261
Samantha:
I'm not panicking.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.695
I'm just trying
to speed us along.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.465
Samantha has proved
time and time again

07:45.498 --> 07:48.435
that she crumbles
under pressure.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.271
Yep, I need that sauce, Sam,
whenever you're ready.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.639
( groans )
Shoot.

07:52.672 --> 07:56.343
Samantha is a little panicky,
a little messy.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.545
She not have
too much control.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.380
I'm getting
a little shaky, so...

08:00.413 --> 08:02.115
- We ain't got time for that.
- Samantha: Okay, sorry.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.850
- We got this.
- All right, I'm gonna go grab--

08:03.883 --> 08:05.385
- ( thud )
- Samantha: Shoot, ow.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.854
- Gordon: You okay?
- Dear, oh dear.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.227
I'm getting
a little shaky, so...

08:14.261 --> 08:15.395
Gerron: We ain't got time
for that.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.030
- Okay, sorry.
- We got this.

08:17.064 --> 08:19.499
- All right.
- Samantha is a little panicky.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.634
- She not have too much control.
- ( Samantha sighs )

08:21.668 --> 08:23.536
- I'm gonna go grab our--
- ( thud )

08:23.570 --> 08:25.072
- Samantha: Shoot, ow.
- Gerron: You okay?

08:25.105 --> 08:27.174
- Samantha: That hurt.
- Dear, oh dear.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.875
- Gordon: What has she done?
- Gerron: What happened?

08:28.908 --> 08:31.078
I hit my knee.
( exhales )

08:31.111 --> 08:33.580
- You good?
- I'm good, I'm just
moving a bit slow now.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.048
Not good.
Not good at all.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.084
( winces )
Ow.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.551
Let me review
what I've done, okay?

08:38.585 --> 08:39.552
- Yes, please.
- So you can see where we're at.

08:39.586 --> 08:40.820
Spice rub is done.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.555
- Sauce is working.
- Okay.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.923
Gordon:
Cesar and Ashley,
what a pairing.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.392
They seem so much
more organized.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.726
Did you get the ratatouille
in the oven?

08:46.759 --> 08:47.727
- Yeah, I got it in.
- Okay.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.562
But Gerron could carry Samantha.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.364
Gerron: I got salt and pepper
on the lamb.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.766
Gordon: Guys,
40 minutes remaining.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.402
Remember,
three stunning dishes.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.337
- Heard, Chef.
- Ashley and Cesar,

08:57.370 --> 08:59.506
Chef Daniel is here.
Give us an insight
into the dish.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.573
Tell me what the dish is,
please.

09:00.607 --> 09:03.776
We have a mojito
ancho pork chop

09:03.810 --> 09:06.746
with some Swiss chard,
crispy plantain stacks,

09:06.779 --> 09:09.249
and then a corn
and mango sauce.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.085
- Corn and mango?
- Why? Corn very sweet...

09:12.119 --> 09:13.220
- Yeah.
- ...mango very sweet.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.287
Very sweet too, yeah.

09:14.321 --> 09:15.522
We're gonna
balance that out

09:15.555 --> 09:16.789
with a aji pepper,
Chef, so...

09:16.823 --> 09:18.691
- Spicy, sweet, tangy.
- Yes, yes.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.260
Nice.
Congratulations.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.095
- You seem to go along well.
- Thank you.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.397
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Chefs.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.099
I'm so curious as to how these
are gonna come out,

09:26.133 --> 09:28.435
- but I really think
this will work.
- Yeah.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.603
That lamb's
getting a nice sear on it.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.772
Good. Make sure you watch
that fat.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.074
- Yep.
- Gordon: Half way.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.743
- 30 minutes remaining.
- Ashley: Heard.

09:36.776 --> 09:38.878
- You gotta get your pork on.
- Okay.

09:38.911 --> 09:42.249
I'm worried a little bit
about this rhubarb
glaze with the lamb.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.784
Don't worry about it.
It's good, we tasted it,
you know?

09:44.817 --> 09:46.586
- Samantha: Okay.
- Lidia: Hi, guys.

09:46.619 --> 09:48.121
- Gerron: Hi! How you doing?
- Joe: So, this is Gerron,

09:48.155 --> 09:50.590
one of my mentees.
He has my last apron.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.459
Did he teach you
anything good?

09:52.492 --> 09:54.127
Oh, he teaches me
everything I know!

09:54.161 --> 09:56.229
- Good.
- So Samantha's 20 years old.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.097
She's a college student.
She's my daughter's age.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.400
Oh, my God.
These all could be
my grandchildren here.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.635
- ( laughter )
- Joe: What's your strategy
with this dish?

10:02.669 --> 10:04.637
We are doing a beautiful
rack of lamb, Chef.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.406
We're also going to do
a ratatouille.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.342
And then a blood orange and
rhubarb glaze on the lamb.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.311
Lidia:
The rhubarb glaze.
Let me see.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.646
Blood orange and rhubarb,
I could see that with duck.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.082
That's an obvious connection,
but with lamb?

10:16.115 --> 10:17.817
- That seems odd.
- Gordon: I don't get it.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.652
- Lidia: That's rather sweet.
- Okay.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.588
So, you know,
what I would say,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.756
you want balance,
you want harmony,
taste everything.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.259
You know, this apparatus
that you have here

10:26.293 --> 10:28.328
is a good machine,
tells you a lot of stuff.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.197
- Okay, yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.465
- Thank you.
- Lidia: All right,
good luck, guys.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.301
All right, so,
how are they looking?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.669
Good. I gotta get
the fat rendered off.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.005
- Okay, cool.
- Do you want to taste
this sauce?

10:39.038 --> 10:40.039
Yes.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.143
- More lamb demi.
- All right, Daniel, so,

10:44.177 --> 10:46.179
Ashley and Cesar,
how are they doing?

10:46.213 --> 10:47.880
They are doing amazing,
actually.

10:47.914 --> 10:50.283
- Drop the plantains
in about four minutes?
- Heard.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.519
You can really see
the teamwork of both of them.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.487
Ashley is in charge
of the plantain.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.289
- All right, I just need
to do two more.
- Okay.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.490
Daniel:
Plantain can be tricky.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.891
I mean, they can go
both ways.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.327
They can go crunchy
or they can go soft.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.195
Daniel: Yeah,
I'm anxious to taste

11:02.229 --> 11:04.864
Cesar and Ashley's
mango and corn
with the pork.

11:04.897 --> 11:07.500
I hope it's
a winning idea.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.502
I think it's a toss-up,
I really do.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.538
The question with the pork
is the temperature.

11:11.571 --> 11:14.307
You know, it becomes tough
if you overcook it
just a little bit.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.743
And Samantha and Gerron,
how are they progressing?

11:16.776 --> 11:18.645
Lidia: Very good.
I feel that Gerron

11:18.678 --> 11:19.912
is quite good
with the meat.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.381
All right, Samantha,
right now,

11:21.414 --> 11:23.850
I am brushing olive oil
on the bones.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.685
Lidia: The rack of lamb
looks great.

11:25.718 --> 11:28.888
The question now is whether
he put enough flavoring on it.

11:28.921 --> 11:30.990
Daniel: They are doing
a little spicy rhubarb glaze.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.326
Rhubarb, for a glaze,
what do you think?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.395
- I have never used it.
- I'm gonna see
what they're gonna do.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.929
- Our lamb is resting.
- Okay.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.266
Less than 15 minutes left.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.869
Heard, Chef.
I need a knife, a clean knife,
a clean knife.

11:42.902 --> 11:45.272
Cesar, can you pass me
your knife?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.675
( groans )
Come on, Cesar.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.343
- Aarón: Cesar.
- Yes?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.879
Work as a team.
Talk, come on.

11:52.912 --> 11:55.047
- Okay, Ashley.
- Thank you.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.916
Samantha: What do you
need me to do, Gerron?

11:56.949 --> 11:58.951
- Go ahead and start
your Swiss chard.
- Okay.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.788
I need to check
this ratatouille out.

12:01.821 --> 12:03.923
- How's it looking?
- Oh, it looks pretty good.

12:03.956 --> 12:06.426
- Okay.
- All of a sudden,
Samantha and Gerron

12:06.459 --> 12:08.295
- have got it back together.
- Samantha: Whoo! Good.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.531
So Ashley, how are you guys
gonna both impart

12:11.564 --> 12:12.932
your particular style
on this dish?

12:12.965 --> 12:15.067
Even though we both love pork,

12:15.101 --> 12:18.037
I wanted my Miami
and his Mexican influence

12:18.070 --> 12:20.773
to be highlighted together
seamlessly on the plate.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.375
Beautiful.
What are you responsible for?

12:22.409 --> 12:23.943
I'm doing a different spin
on a tostone,

12:23.976 --> 12:26.613
so I'm doing very
thinly sliced plantains,

12:26.646 --> 12:28.481
and they're gonna be
stacks and rounds.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.550
Did you ever see anything
like this when you grew up?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.319
- No, I didn't.
- This is totally
from your head.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.621
Yeah, I've done it
with potatoes before,

12:34.654 --> 12:36.789
and I figure, you know,
we're going tropical,
we're going Mexican,

12:36.823 --> 12:39.258
so let me go for
a different starch

12:39.292 --> 12:40.827
and the green plantain
popped in my mind.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.495
- Aarón: Wonderful.
- Great.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.830
- Cesar: Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you very much.

12:43.863 --> 12:45.632
How are you doing over there?

12:45.665 --> 12:47.667
Good, I'm adding a bit
of veg stock to the chard,

12:47.700 --> 12:48.835
'cause it was a little dry.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.303
- Good job.
- Thank you.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.604
Gordon:
Guys, last two minutes.

12:51.638 --> 12:52.972
Ashley:
Okay, come on, Cesar.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.507
Samantha:
Gerron, start cutting the lamb.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.008
I'm getting nervous for them,
for gosh sakes.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.344
I'll be behind you.
Go for it.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.413
How is it, Gerron?
Is it perfect?

13:00.447 --> 13:03.149
- Mmm, it's perfect.
- Yeah, yeah, nice.

13:03.182 --> 13:04.851
90 seconds to go, guys.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.486
Cesar: Ashley, we really
gotta hurry up now.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.254
Samantha: Come on, Gerron,
I'm ready for that lamb.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.457
One team, catapulted straight
to the grand finale.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.791
- Cesar: Come on, come on.
Hurry, hurry!
- Ashley: Move, move!

13:11.824 --> 13:14.327
- Oh, it looks beautiful, Sam.
- Yup.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.262
- Think presentation, guys.
- Ashley: Careful. Those are
nice, those are nice.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.164
- Gordon: This is it.
- Samantha: I'm wiping,
I'm wiping.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.667
- There you go, there you go.
- 30 seconds remaining.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.834
- Get some salt,
get some salt to finish 'em.
- Yup.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.336
Okay, now we'll do
Maldon salt.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.837
Take an inventory
of your ingredients.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.839
- Come on.
Do we have everything?
- Nice, nice.

13:26.873 --> 13:30.943
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

13:30.977 --> 13:35.948
five, four, three, two, one.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.984
Gordon: And stop,
hands in the air.
Well done.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.325
That was an intense
60 minutes, guys.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.194
- All: Yes, Chef.
- Well done.

13:48.227 --> 13:53.165
And as you know, only one team
will go straight to the finale.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.535
And the only way
we can make that decision

13:55.568 --> 13:58.871
is by tasting
your amazing looking dishes.

14:00.206 --> 14:01.674
They look great, the dishes,
don't they?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.309
- Joe and Aarón: Fantastic.
- Amazing.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.679
Cesar, Ashley,
what is your dish?

14:06.713 --> 14:08.047
Cesar: Grilled pork chop

14:08.080 --> 14:10.750
with a bed of sautéed
Swiss chard,

14:10.783 --> 14:13.853
corn mango salsa,
and tostones.

14:13.886 --> 14:15.722
The plate looks wonderful.

14:15.755 --> 14:19.726
It looks complex, intriguing,
and yet not overly done.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.994
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.531
Daniel:
Time to taste.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.865
Gordon:
They love the presentation.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.834
But look at
that white fat there.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.570
- Your mum's not
gonna like that.
- Joe: Yeah.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.542
Jonathan:
So, where did the dish
come from?

14:35.575 --> 14:37.410
You guys were collaborative
with that, right?

14:37.444 --> 14:39.211
Yeah, this was a culmination

14:39.245 --> 14:42.048
of all of our challenges here
and our journey,

14:42.081 --> 14:45.084
making sure that we really
presented our cultures

14:45.117 --> 14:47.720
in a very beautiful
and respectful way.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.722
Well, I found that

14:49.756 --> 14:53.726
the pork chop was seasoned
very, very nicely.

14:53.760 --> 14:57.063
The meat itself
was a little bit fatty.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.732
In the future,
look at the marbling
of the fats.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.934
Actually,
I liked the fattiness.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.903
- Me too. Me too.
- Lidia, I'm sorry,
but I-- I love fat.

15:03.936 --> 15:06.739
But, um, you know,
I must say,

15:06.773 --> 15:11.077
as a collective,
this really works well.

15:11.110 --> 15:14.080
The Swiss chard just had
the right amount of garlic
in it.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.783
The pork, you got beautiful
caramelization,

15:16.816 --> 15:18.785
but you might add a little more
depth of flavor.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.119
Tell me about the brine.

15:20.152 --> 15:22.088
The brine had champagne vinegar,

15:22.121 --> 15:25.925
some pickling spices,
some sugar.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.594
What kind of sugar?
Was it white or brown?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.929
- It was white sugar.
- Next time try brown.

15:29.962 --> 15:32.098
- Okay.
- Little more depth of flavor

15:32.131 --> 15:34.634
when you have one
of the darker sugars.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.569
But you know what?
It's really superb.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.771
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much, Chef.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.773
Overall, it's a very
pleasing dish,

15:40.807 --> 15:43.810
full of soul, taste,
and love.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.945
- Gordon: ( whispers ) Perfect.
- Aarón: ( whispers ) Yeah.

15:45.978 --> 15:50.182
Considering this is made
by a high school teacher

15:50.216 --> 15:53.252
and a professional
grocery shopper,

15:53.285 --> 15:55.822
- I am very impressed.
- Ashley and Cesar: Thank you.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.023
Wow!

15:58.958 --> 16:02.128
All right, Samantha and Gerron,
what is the name of your dish?

16:02.161 --> 16:06.799
Gerron: A rhubarb
and blood orange
glazed lamb chop

16:06.833 --> 16:09.936
with a ratatouille
and Swiss chard.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.873
For sure, I'm blown away
by the level of plating here.

16:13.906 --> 16:17.209
This is the work of a chef,
not a home cook.

16:17.243 --> 16:19.646
Thank you, Chef.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.180
Time to taste.

16:25.084 --> 16:27.486
- Gordon: They're diving
straight in there.
- Aarón: Yeah.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.522
It's a good sign.
Maybe they like it.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.524
How did you approach
this challenge?

16:31.558 --> 16:33.893
In this competition,
we've been underestimated,

16:33.926 --> 16:36.663
as far as like they say Samantha
does pasta all the time,

16:36.696 --> 16:39.966
and people say that I stick
to my Southern cuisine
all the time.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.001
So, we really just wanted
to push out

16:42.034 --> 16:44.503
what we've learned
in the MasterChef kitchen,

16:44.537 --> 16:46.639
knowing that we needed
to prove ourselves,

16:46.673 --> 16:49.676
to get to that balcony
and get to the finale.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.544
I think the lamb--

16:51.578 --> 16:56.849
the outside has beautiful,
roasted glaze, and the rhubarb.

16:56.883 --> 17:01.688
This is wonderful, 'cause that
really give addition of flavor

17:01.721 --> 17:04.891
and it bring that chewiness
you need in the ratatouille.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.659
- That's wonderful.
- Thank you.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.095
I feel like I am
in the South of France.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.197
Gerron and Samantha:
Thank you.

17:11.230 --> 17:14.233
Listen, he's French,
so he doesn't really understand

17:14.266 --> 17:17.704
that this is more of an American
version of ratatouille.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.839
- ( chuckles )
- Let me clear one thing
right away.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.774
Forget about French
or American.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.176
That's an Italian vegetable,
tortino.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.878
- Ah!
- Okay?

17:25.912 --> 17:28.547
You see, the French learn
everything from the Italian.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.784
Nobody beats the Italians
for their restaurants.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.086
I think the tortino
was a little sweet.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.056
The rhubarb I thought
was a genius idea.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.058
I could've even used
a little more.

17:39.091 --> 17:42.729
You know, don't be afraid
to express yourself.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.231
That's what creativity
is all about.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.799
It's a great dish.

17:46.833 --> 17:50.102
You guys really are
on a professional level

17:50.136 --> 17:52.038
on both sides.
Bravo!

17:52.071 --> 17:54.941
This glaze,
I'm fascinated here.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.909
- There's a little spice in it.
- Samantha: Yeah.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.244
Some Aleppo pepper flakes.

17:58.277 --> 17:59.912
Ah!

17:59.946 --> 18:02.148
And you did have some zest
as well.

18:02.181 --> 18:03.582
Well done, guys.
Thank you.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.985
- Gerron: Thank you.
- Thanks.

18:06.018 --> 18:09.922
I'm really, really eager
to find out who won.

18:09.956 --> 18:12.124
All four of you, please,
come around to the front.

18:12.158 --> 18:15.261
I know that both dishes received
positive compliments.

18:15.294 --> 18:18.665
Joe, Gordon, and Aarón,
will you come downstairs?

18:18.698 --> 18:21.600
But I feel like Cesar
and I truly put ourselves

18:21.634 --> 18:24.570
and our stories on a plate.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.273
I really think we pulled off
a victory.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.908
It's a nerve-racking evening,

18:28.941 --> 18:30.643
high pressure and
very high stakes.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.779
But there are three
other mentors,

18:32.812 --> 18:35.748
that are probably feeling
the pressure even more
than you guys.

18:35.782 --> 18:39.151
And they placed the decision
solely in our hands.

18:39.185 --> 18:41.954
But now we have
a huge decision to make.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.990
Please give us a moment.

18:45.357 --> 18:47.193
Thank you.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.996
Whichever team wins,
I've got somebody in the finale.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.330
- Aarón: Yeah.
- Oh, you do, that's right.

18:51.363 --> 18:53.632
Aarón:
I need Cesar and Ashley to win.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.935
We are
at opposing interests.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.870
Aarón:
Absolutely.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.472
- So?
- This is a really fine line

19:00.506 --> 19:03.375
of which one is better
than the other.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.477
- But it was very close, guys.
- Very close.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.179
( sighs )

19:07.213 --> 19:08.514
The lamb was cooked right.

19:08.547 --> 19:10.316
Daniel:
I think they were very original

19:10.349 --> 19:14.553
with the addition of blood
oranges and the rhubarb.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.488
This can go any way
and I'm like--

19:16.522 --> 19:18.224
Yeah, I know.
It's so close.

19:18.257 --> 19:20.226
- The pork really was
the king here.
- Yeah.

19:20.259 --> 19:21.828
- That's hard to pull off.
- Yeah, hard--

19:21.861 --> 19:23.863
One thing I felt was
this plantain chips,

19:23.896 --> 19:25.865
missed a little bit.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.533
- But I think we've decided,
I think.
- Yeah, I think.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.909
Well, we've been saying it
all night,

19:36.943 --> 19:38.510
an incredible job.

19:38.544 --> 19:43.215
Unfortunately, only one team
can guarantee their spot

19:43.249 --> 19:46.318
in the final
of "MasterChef."

19:46.352 --> 19:48.354
And that team is...

19:48.387 --> 19:50.222
Congratulations...

19:55.862 --> 20:00.867
Unfortunately, only one team
can guarantee their spot

20:00.900 --> 20:03.202
in the final
of "MasterChef."

20:03.235 --> 20:05.537
( whispers )
Oh, my God. I want this.

20:05.571 --> 20:07.774
And that team is...

20:11.878 --> 20:13.079
...Cesar and Ashley.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.014
( both scream )

20:15.047 --> 20:17.016
- Wow!
- Oh, my God!

20:17.049 --> 20:22.855
Making it to the finale means
everything is validated.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.356
Head up to the balcony, please.

20:24.390 --> 20:28.761
This is the W
that I have been waiting for

20:28.795 --> 20:31.530
this entire competition.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.065
Hands down.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.135
Judges, thank you.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.937
Gerron, Samantha,
wow, what a night.

20:37.970 --> 20:42.909
We still have one more spot
in the finale up for grabs.

20:42.942 --> 20:47.113
But first, join us in thanking
these incredible judges.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.447
Thank you, Gordon.
Thank you, Aarón.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.950
- Thank you, Joe.
- Thank you, guys.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.485
- Daniel: Congratulations.
- Gordon: Thank you so much.

20:53.519 --> 20:57.223
I'm so happy for Cesar and
Ashley to make it to the finale,

20:57.256 --> 20:58.891
and I just really hope
that I can join them soon.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.893
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.262
- Good job.
- Samantha: Thank you.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.731
I love Gerron,
but I have to take him down,

21:05.764 --> 21:08.167
and I'm gonna do that tonight.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.569
Gerron:
Me and Samantha
gotta go head to head

21:10.602 --> 21:11.737
to stay
in this competition,

21:11.770 --> 21:14.773
so I am extremely nervous,

21:14.807 --> 21:18.777
because Samantha is a great
chef and an even better baker,

21:18.811 --> 21:21.313
and that scares the living crap
out of me.

21:21.347 --> 21:26.118
Gerron, Samantha, to earn the
last spot in the grand finale,

21:26.152 --> 21:29.755
you'll both have to make a dish
that I want you to make.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.124
And a dish
that I want you to make.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.460
And a dish
that I want you to make.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.829
And unfortunately for you both,

21:36.863 --> 21:41.834
tonight,
we don't want the same dish.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.270
Tonight's challenge is
to make us

21:44.303 --> 21:47.506
an impeccable
three-course dinner.

21:47.539 --> 21:49.876
( whispers )
Man.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.478
To start this meal off,
I want you to replicate

21:52.511 --> 21:55.114
one of my favorite appetizers.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.116
This is extremely technical.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.719
It requires total attention
to detail,

22:00.752 --> 22:02.288
and impeccable timing.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.323
It is...

22:06.525 --> 22:09.862
...spring risotto
with fresh pea puree,

22:09.896 --> 22:13.532
white and green asparagus
and Grana Padano on top.

22:13.565 --> 22:15.567
You rarely see it
on restaurant menus,

22:15.601 --> 22:19.705
'cause it's just that hard
to nail it.

22:19.738 --> 22:21.173
And for your second course
tonight...

22:22.674 --> 22:24.676
...it's a dish full
of complex flavors,

22:24.710 --> 22:26.645
and has many techniques
on display

22:26.678 --> 22:29.848
on just this one plate.

22:29.882 --> 22:33.285
I can't wait to see both of you
replicate this masterpiece.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.726
Pan-seared salmon
with beet confit,

22:40.759 --> 22:45.264
parsnip puree, and a lovely
citrus vinaigrette.

22:45.297 --> 22:48.400
This dish is a great barometer
of your culinary skill,

22:48.434 --> 22:51.570
how much you've learned in
plating, and how to multitask.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.075
Tonight, I want you both

22:56.108 --> 22:59.011
to replicate one
of my most famous desserts,

22:59.045 --> 23:01.347
a signature dish of mine

23:01.380 --> 23:04.383
that's on several of my menus
across the world.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.621
( whispers )
Oh, wow!

23:11.157 --> 23:14.193
A stunning
sticky toffee pudding

23:14.226 --> 23:17.096
with a mascarpone mousse.

23:17.129 --> 23:20.366
Tonight, your sticky toffee
pudding needs to be moist,

23:20.399 --> 23:23.202
flavorful,
but also not too sweet.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.037
But let me warn you.

23:25.071 --> 23:29.441
If your sticky toffee pudding
is dry, it's game over.

23:29.475 --> 23:31.410
Right, you'll both have
just 90 minutes

23:31.443 --> 23:33.212
to complete all three courses.

23:33.245 --> 23:39.085
The finale is so close
you can almost taste it.

23:39.118 --> 23:42.454
Please, both of you,
head to your stations.

23:42.488 --> 23:44.090
Samantha and Gerron
have to make

23:44.123 --> 23:47.059
a three-course meal
in 90 minutes,

23:47.093 --> 23:49.061
by themselves.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.664
You literally have
to be a master chef,

23:52.698 --> 23:54.600
such as Gordon Ramsay,

23:54.633 --> 23:56.635
in order to just be safe.

23:59.038 --> 24:02.674
At your stations you'll find
all the ingredients you need

24:02.708 --> 24:06.278
to make our three
complex dishes.

24:07.546 --> 24:08.947
Are you both ready?

24:08.981 --> 24:10.416
Both:
Yes, Chef.

24:10.449 --> 24:14.086
Your 90 minutes start... now.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.989
- Ashley: Let's go, y'all.
- Cesar: Go, guys.
Give it your best.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.260
Gents, a very tough challenge,

24:21.293 --> 24:25.631
a three-course dinner
to get your spot in the finale.

24:25.664 --> 24:27.666
God, this is gonna
be intense.

24:27.699 --> 24:30.169
Gordon:
You know risotto needs to be
done in the last 20 minutes.

24:30.202 --> 24:33.105
The salmon needs to be cooked
with eight to ten minutes to go.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.674
Let's be honest.
Both those dishes don't hold.

24:35.707 --> 24:37.376
And so, was that done
on purpose?

24:37.409 --> 24:39.111
The jeopardy of this challenge
is the timing.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.113
We are vying for a spot
in the finale,

24:41.147 --> 24:43.615
so the techniques have
to be super demanding today.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.317
Y'all gonna have
to show out today.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.619
Joe: Now, Gordon,
what is the process?

24:47.653 --> 24:50.289
- Joe: What do you do first?
- Dessert, 'cause that
mousse has to set.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.658
First off, you get
the mascarpone mousse set up
with the gelatin.

24:52.691 --> 24:54.793
- Samantha, what is that for?
- The mousse.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.528
It's gotta come to 165.

24:56.562 --> 24:58.330
Gordon:
Get it set into the mold,
into the fridge.

24:58.364 --> 25:00.332
I'm looking good,
I'm looking good.

25:00.366 --> 25:01.967
If it's not set
properly,

25:02.000 --> 25:03.469
- then it can turn
into a puddle.
- Yeah.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.670
I gotta get this mousse in.

25:04.703 --> 25:06.205
Gotta get this mousse in,
come on.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.506
Gordon:
Now the sticky toffee pudding,

25:07.539 --> 25:10.142
a difficult dessert to execute.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.344
It takes time to rise,
time to cook.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.480
More importantly,
you need an even distribution

25:14.513 --> 25:16.682
of those dates
across that mixture.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.517
You've gotta be so precise.

25:20.619 --> 25:22.388
Now, come on.
Aarón, salmon.

25:22.421 --> 25:23.989
- Why?
- Well, for me, I wanted to see

25:24.022 --> 25:25.991
how they had progressed
in this competition

25:26.024 --> 25:29.661
on cooking very delicate,
and very temperamental proteins.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.030
So, salmon, you have to cook
the skin properly,

25:32.064 --> 25:34.166
making sure it's scored
and crispy,

25:34.200 --> 25:36.335
locking in all the juices,
that's crucial.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.104
Next, you gotta
make your purees,

25:38.137 --> 25:39.738
but it has to be silky smooth.

25:39.771 --> 25:42.241
Get your beet confit
going early...

25:42.274 --> 25:44.176
Come on, baby.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.412
...'cause those beets
need 20 to 30 minutes to cook

25:46.445 --> 25:49.014
- in that vinegar-sugar base.
- Gotcha.

25:49.047 --> 25:52.684
60 minutes remaining.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.354
Samantha, three courses.
Out of the three dishes,

25:55.387 --> 25:57.356
what's the one dish
you're most worried about?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.291
I'm definitely worried
about the sticky
toffee pudding,

25:59.325 --> 26:01.693
'cause baking is something
I'm great at,

26:01.727 --> 26:04.563
but if you mess up
just a little bit,
it can all go south.

26:04.596 --> 26:06.598
But I am not ready
for this to be my last cook

26:06.632 --> 26:08.267
in the MasterChef kitchen.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.536
I've come a long way.
I'm not ready to go home.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.238
I've been incredibly proud
of what you've achieved.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.140
- Thank you, Chef.
- Final hurdle.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.375
- Yes.
- Don't let yourself down.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.377
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.313
Gordon:
Just under 50 minutes to go.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.315
- Speed up.
- Keep moving.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.551
So, halfway through
at this point,

26:25.584 --> 26:27.453
the sticky toffee pudding should
be already assembled, right?

26:27.486 --> 26:28.654
Gordon:
It should be going in now.

26:28.687 --> 26:31.390
350 for 30 minutes.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.392
The mascarpone should
be in the freezer.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.727
- You should have that
all under control.
- Hundred percent.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.497
- Gordon: 45 minutes remaining.
- Oh, my God.

26:38.530 --> 26:39.898
You've got to multitask.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.767
I need my timer.
28 minutes.

26:45.003 --> 26:47.173
Oh no, the gelatin didn't go in.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.008
Shoot.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.010
I knew I was forgetting
something.

26:52.043 --> 26:54.480
- She didn't put her gelatin
in her mousse.
- Oh, wow.

26:54.513 --> 26:56.081
Aarón:
Samantha,

26:56.114 --> 26:58.250
- I think she forgot
her gelatin.
- Ooh!

26:58.284 --> 27:00.486
I can save it, I can save it.

27:00.519 --> 27:02.454
( sighs )

27:04.723 --> 27:07.593
I'm not too sure
if they're gonna be set in time.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.428
In the beginning
of the competition

27:09.461 --> 27:11.263
you had some wiggle room
for mistakes,

27:11.297 --> 27:14.766
but right now being,
literally,

27:14.800 --> 27:16.535
one step away
from the finale,

27:16.568 --> 27:18.170
there's no room for error.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.505
All good, I can save it.

27:19.538 --> 27:20.972
I'm afraid for Samantha
right now.

27:24.876 --> 27:27.879
Sam.
( groans )

27:34.886 --> 27:37.856
Gordon:
45 minutes remaining.

27:37.889 --> 27:39.991
Samantha started off
with the mascarpone mousse

27:40.025 --> 27:42.394
and had forgot to put
the gelatin in.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.996
So, what's happened now is
that the whole mixture's
become a lot thinner.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.598
Lost that mousse effect.

27:47.899 --> 27:49.835
Good job, Sam.

27:49.868 --> 27:52.704
Gordon:
We are down to 30 minutes
remaining.

27:52.738 --> 27:55.807
Get your pans hot,
start cooking that risotto,

27:55.841 --> 27:58.244
and start thinking
about the execution

27:58.277 --> 28:00.412
of these three difficult dishes.

28:00.446 --> 28:03.215
There we go.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.551
Gordon:
Now, Joe, why a risotto?

28:05.584 --> 28:09.020
This risotto is gonna
test their skills
and their technique.

28:09.054 --> 28:12.258
Now, a risotto takes
20 to 24 minutes to cook,

28:12.291 --> 28:14.226
and there's
no negotiating that.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.362
Low and slow, baby.
Low and slow.

28:16.395 --> 28:19.665
You slowly and gently
coax the starches out
of each grain of rice,

28:19.698 --> 28:22.401
- Whoo!
- without exploding it
or breaking it,

28:22.434 --> 28:25.271
so these cooks have
to time it right.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.373
Make sure this is tender.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.907
Gerron is a little bit
fragmented.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.709
He's running from one side
to the other.

28:30.742 --> 28:33.445
Get to multitasking
on two things.

28:33.479 --> 28:34.880
He's got a lot of stuff
boiling away there.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.382
He should check it.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.716
Measuring cup.

28:37.749 --> 28:39.551
Something doesn't smell good.

28:40.919 --> 28:42.888
Ah, ( bleep ).

28:42.921 --> 28:45.223
Look at Gerron.
Those pickled beets are burnt.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.792
This guy's a mess.

28:46.825 --> 28:48.294
Get your mind right.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.296
Damn!

28:50.329 --> 28:51.763
- Right. How you doing?
- Hi, Chef.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.465
We seem a little bit
all over the place.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.800
I got a lot of stuff
going on,

28:54.833 --> 28:56.101
but that's the way
that my mind works.

28:56.134 --> 28:58.570
As a teacher I have
to always be moving.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.606
There's a spot up for grabs
in the finale,

29:00.639 --> 29:02.708
so we can't be
all over the place.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.710
- Yes, Chef.
- Um, the beet root,
where are they?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.645
I had to start over.
You taught me not to work
with mistakes.

29:06.678 --> 29:10.048
JB has me in his best interests,
and I can't let him down.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.983
I'm getting up there.
There's no doubt about it.

29:12.017 --> 29:14.453
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

29:17.088 --> 29:20.326
Final push.
Just over ten minutes to go.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.993
These are gonna be
the craziest ten minutes

29:22.027 --> 29:25.096
- I have ever watched, yeah.
- Ashley: Ever watched.

29:25.130 --> 29:29.435
Look at-- Samantha's
the first one out of
the oven with the cake.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.836
Gordon:
Gerron's sticky
toffee pudding.

29:30.869 --> 29:32.103
He's got them out.

29:32.137 --> 29:34.406
There's so many things.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.907
Focus, focus, focus.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.510
Samantha hasn't started
the salmon yet.

29:38.544 --> 29:39.978
Is she too late?

29:41.313 --> 29:43.181
Kiss it on that side.

29:43.214 --> 29:45.351
And Gerron's salmon has been
in the pan for quite a while.

29:45.384 --> 29:46.652
No, you can't do that.

29:48.987 --> 29:51.490
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on, nice and creamy.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.359
Three minutes to go.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.660
You've got
to start plating, guys.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.964
Come on, Gerron.
Push, push, push.

29:58.997 --> 30:01.700
Gerron's risotto
looks amazing.

30:04.903 --> 30:07.539
60 seconds, guys.
This is it!

30:07.573 --> 30:09.107
Come on, come on,
come on.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.811
Gordon:
Just one spot remaining
in the finale.

30:12.844 --> 30:14.980
Let's go!

30:15.013 --> 30:18.684
- This is insane.
- Ten, nine, eight,

30:18.717 --> 30:22.621
seven, six, five, four,

30:22.654 --> 30:25.724
three, two, one.

30:25.757 --> 30:28.527
- And stop.
- Wow!

30:28.560 --> 30:31.062
- ( groans )
- Incredible performance.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.900
Now it's time to taste

30:34.933 --> 30:39.671
all of those
incredible-looking dishes.

30:39.705 --> 30:42.974
Let's start
where every great dinner begins,

30:43.008 --> 30:44.676
the appetizers.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.645
Please,
bring your risottos up here.

30:46.678 --> 30:51.683
That was the toughest 90 minutes
of my entire life,

30:51.717 --> 30:54.553
especially because I've never
cooked risotto before.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.988
But my risotto is beautiful.

30:57.022 --> 31:00.492
I do not know
how I pulled this together.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.562
I think I may have a slight
advantage on this one.

31:06.064 --> 31:07.533
Samantha,
how was the cooking the rice?

31:07.566 --> 31:08.834
How was the process?

31:08.867 --> 31:11.837
I did not get the pea puree
on the plate,

31:11.870 --> 31:13.772
but I think the flavor
of the risotto,

31:13.805 --> 31:15.707
and the texture
of the risotto's there.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.375
- Gerron.
- Yes.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.377
- How'd you do?
- I think I did pretty well.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.680
The texture is just right.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.783
Got the cream in, the butter,
the Parmesan cheese.

31:24.816 --> 31:27.886
Everything is there
and the rice is nice and tender.

31:27.919 --> 31:30.422
Samantha, what do you think is
gonna be the better risotto?

31:30.456 --> 31:31.923
I'm thinking mine is gonna
be the better risotto.

31:31.957 --> 31:34.560
He relied heavily
on the fat

31:34.593 --> 31:36.061
to get the risotto
where it needs to be,

31:36.094 --> 31:38.363
and I focused
on the grains of rice.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.065
How much wine did you put in?

31:40.098 --> 31:42.601
Um, about a quarter cup.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.437
Gerron,
what do you think?

31:45.471 --> 31:47.372
I think mine's is gonna
be the better one

31:47.405 --> 31:49.908
simply because, you know,
when it's grainy like Sam's,

31:49.941 --> 31:51.977
that's not pleasing
to the palate.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.046
How much heavy cream
did you put in?

31:55.080 --> 31:57.082
Uh, I just, uh,
kinda eyeballed it.

31:57.115 --> 32:00.285
I don't think that you really
need a set measurement

32:00.318 --> 32:02.788
of how much you put of,
you know, each ingredient.

32:06.825 --> 32:09.761
Overall,
two exceptional risottos,

32:09.795 --> 32:12.931
but I think there is one
I prefer over the other.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.937
Nothing's incorrect
about either of them.

32:18.970 --> 32:21.940
One is leaner,
a little bit undercooked.

32:21.973 --> 32:25.176
This one is more fatter,
a little bit overcooked.

32:25.210 --> 32:28.046
- Tough one. Both two
good-looking risottos.
- Yeah.

32:30.982 --> 32:34.119
Okay, let's get
to the main course.

32:34.152 --> 32:36.855
Please, both of you,
bring up your entrées.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.991
Samantha:
I'm really nervous because
I hardly ever cook salmon,

32:40.025 --> 32:42.794
but I don't see any indication
that it's overcooked.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.796
It looks perfectly done.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.598
So, it's gonna be a close one,

32:46.632 --> 32:48.166
but I really think
I've got Gerron on this.

32:50.335 --> 32:54.773
Gerron, how did you feel
that salmon entrée
unfolded for you?

32:54.806 --> 32:57.709
I feel like I got the salmon on
at the perfect time.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.611
I got the parsnip puree
on there.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.613
I just ran out of time
with the beets.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.715
Samantha, how was the cook
on the salmon?

33:03.749 --> 33:05.984
I feel that the cook
on the salmon is good.

33:06.017 --> 33:07.886
I'm glad I got
the vinaigrette on there,

33:07.919 --> 33:10.956
but I'm disappointed that I
only got the beets on there.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.158
When I cut into your salmon,
Sam, what should I see

33:13.191 --> 33:15.527
when I open that up
and expose it?

33:15.561 --> 33:16.795
It should still be pink.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.530
I'm gonna tell
you right now,

33:18.564 --> 33:20.398
this salmon could be worth
a quarter of a million dollars.

33:20.431 --> 33:21.900
Absolutely.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.270
Here we go.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.875
What do you think?

33:29.908 --> 33:31.843
- I think it looks beautiful.
- What do you think, Gerron?

33:31.877 --> 33:34.045
I think it's beautiful.
It's glistening.

33:34.079 --> 33:35.914
Are there elements
of this dish that perhaps
you're worried about?

33:35.947 --> 33:38.349
That skin on the salmon.
That looks a little
too dark for me.

33:47.058 --> 33:49.194
Gerron, how do you feel
about the skin on your salmon?

33:49.227 --> 33:52.230
Me, personally, I kinda like it,
uh, kinda dark that way.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.101
What do you think, Samantha?

33:56.134 --> 33:57.903
It's overcooked.

34:02.574 --> 34:07.779
You guys both did admirable jobs
cooking a very tricky fish,

34:07.813 --> 34:09.414
but I think I like one
more than the other.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.587
Aarón:
So here's the deal.

34:15.621 --> 34:18.056
I think Gerron's was teetering
on overcooked.

34:18.089 --> 34:19.925
- Gordon: Yeah.
- And he was very aggressive
with the sear on the top,

34:19.958 --> 34:22.093
and there's nothing worse
than overcooked salmon.

34:22.127 --> 34:24.062
Samantha,

34:24.095 --> 34:26.632
she cooked it more evenly and
that that skin was perfect.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.066
- Wow.
- All right.

34:31.603 --> 34:34.706
Bring down those incredible
sticky toffee puddings.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.608
Let's go.

34:36.642 --> 34:38.576
Ashley:
Seems like Gerron has the edge
on the risotto.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.145
It was creamier,

34:40.178 --> 34:42.914
but I feel like Samantha
got the edge on Gerron

34:42.948 --> 34:44.650
with the entrée round.

34:44.683 --> 34:48.219
Because you could hear
the crispiness of her salmon.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.756
So right now it's seems like
it's neck and neck.

34:50.789 --> 34:53.659
That incredible mascarpone
mousse, Samantha,

34:53.692 --> 34:56.795
visually,
it's disintegrated.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.565
- Yup.
- Mm.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.533
And where's the caramel?

35:03.802 --> 35:07.238
The caramel is set on top.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.808
When you added that brown sugar,

35:09.841 --> 35:12.110
what had happened
to your butter?

35:13.178 --> 35:14.946
The butter had burned.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.381
Let's taste.

35:18.984 --> 35:20.185
( scraping )

35:20.218 --> 35:22.153
Can you hear that?

35:23.288 --> 35:24.956
It's not good.

35:24.990 --> 35:25.991
Wow.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.363
Can you hear that?

35:32.397 --> 35:34.265
( scraping )

35:34.299 --> 35:35.801
It's not good.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.168
Let's get in there,
shall we?

35:41.006 --> 35:42.307
Wow.

35:43.709 --> 35:46.011
- Mm-hmm.
- That's gorgeous.

35:46.044 --> 35:47.913
It's beautiful.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.723
Let's get into yours,
shall we, young man?

35:57.756 --> 35:58.824
Yes, Chef.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.625
- Gerron.
- Yes, Chef.

36:00.658 --> 36:03.661
How much gelatin did you put
in that mousse?

36:03.695 --> 36:05.731
Two strips.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.032
Ooh.

36:14.172 --> 36:18.209
Two exact recipes
executed differently.

36:18.243 --> 36:20.545
There's one I do prefer.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.183
Excuse me.

36:25.216 --> 36:27.485
I made many mistakes
within that 90 minutes,

36:27.518 --> 36:29.487
but I bounced back
from those mistakes.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.022
As a teacher,

36:31.056 --> 36:32.858
you know,
I teach my kids all the time,

36:32.891 --> 36:34.425
it's not the mistakes you make,

36:34.459 --> 36:36.361
but it's what you learn
from those mistakes.

36:36.394 --> 36:39.064
And I'm hoping that me bouncing
back from these mistakes

36:39.097 --> 36:40.899
is enough to get me
to the finale.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.105
Oh, man.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.606
Two great sponges.

36:48.639 --> 36:50.441
Samantha's was light,
steamed beautiful,

36:50.475 --> 36:53.244
but the problem she had was
with that brown butter on there.

36:53.278 --> 36:55.747
Samantha's mousse,
more liquid than Gerron's.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.849
Oh, but the flavor is
mind-blowing.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.752
- Then there's a level
of heavy richness in Gerron's.
- Too heavy.

37:00.786 --> 37:03.889
Really dense,
caramel beautiful, refined.
There's no graininess.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.391
I just wish he'd taste it before
he put the caramel in there,

37:06.424 --> 37:08.459
'cause what do you
when it's super rich?
Put less caramel on there.

37:08.493 --> 37:12.230
I almost want Samantha's sponge
and Gerron's caramel.

37:12.263 --> 37:13.264
Yup.

37:17.135 --> 37:20.371
There's a place
in the grand finale at stake.

37:20.405 --> 37:23.441
That's why we had such
a difficult challenge.

37:23.474 --> 37:27.879
But both of you did us,
your mentors, proud.

37:27.913 --> 37:31.216
We'll now be picking
the best performances

37:31.249 --> 37:34.953
across all three dishes.

37:34.986 --> 37:38.323
Joe, whose appetizer
was the best?

37:38.356 --> 37:40.926
Joe:
Two different takes on risotto.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.829
Technique was impeccable
in both.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.131
The profile of the dish,
Samantha's, much less fat.

37:46.164 --> 37:47.833
A good cook.

37:47.866 --> 37:50.501
Gerron, much fatter,
much more embellished.

37:50.535 --> 37:53.839
The best risotto tonight...

37:53.872 --> 37:56.141
...was cooked by...

37:58.176 --> 38:00.045
...Gerron.

38:02.180 --> 38:06.017
Aarón, which entrée
did you prefer?

38:06.051 --> 38:08.253
Both salmon were cooked
extremely well,

38:08.286 --> 38:13.091
but one of these salmon I felt
had a better crispier skin,

38:13.124 --> 38:15.160
I thought was seasoned more,

38:15.193 --> 38:19.898
and just had more of
that iconic pink persimmon
colored interior.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.169
So, the home cook
with the best salmon...

38:28.907 --> 38:31.843
...Samantha.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.314
Clearly, it comes down
to dessert,

38:36.347 --> 38:38.816
the sticky toffee pudding.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.051
Samantha, you had the lightness,

38:40.085 --> 38:43.288
and the absolute beauty
and height.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.357
However, you had a mistake
with the caramel,

38:46.391 --> 38:49.027
and you put that brown butter
that's burned on top.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.896
Yeah.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.831
Gerron, yours was
a little denser,
slightly richer

38:53.865 --> 38:55.733
with too much caramel.

38:55.766 --> 38:58.436
The best sticky toffee
pudding...

39:00.371 --> 39:04.542
...and the person claiming
the last spot in the finale...

39:10.581 --> 39:11.549
...Gerron.

39:11.582 --> 39:14.085
( gasps and exhales )

39:16.054 --> 39:17.222
( whispers )
Wow!

39:19.257 --> 39:20.425
Congratulations.

39:20.458 --> 39:25.030
Gerron, head up
to the balcony.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.065
- Thank you.
- Complete our lineup
for the finale.

39:30.568 --> 39:32.103
Good job, guys.
Congrats.

39:32.137 --> 39:33.738
- Good job to you, too.
- Good job, too.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.409
Gordon:
Oh, Samantha.

39:38.443 --> 39:40.578
20 years of age.

39:40.611 --> 39:43.248
Promise me
you're gonna continue.

39:43.281 --> 39:44.582
Of course.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.251
When I get home,
first thing I'm gonna do

39:46.284 --> 39:47.452
is enroll in culinary school.

39:47.485 --> 39:49.054
It's-- it's my dream.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.588
Come on up here
and say goodbye
to us, Samantha.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.658
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.461
- Oh, great job, young lady.
- Thank you.

39:56.494 --> 39:58.063
Oh, you were excellent.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.931
Oh, man.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.266
Great job.

40:01.299 --> 40:02.900
Thank you, Chef.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.302
I didn't think
I'd be saying this,

40:04.335 --> 40:07.605
but please, put your apron
on your bench,

40:07.638 --> 40:09.574
- and have a safe trip home.
- Thank you, Chef.

40:09.607 --> 40:11.576
- Good luck, my darling.
- Good night.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.244
- Bye, Samantha.
- Love you, Sam.

40:13.278 --> 40:14.745
Bye, guys.

40:14.779 --> 40:16.147
Keep going.

40:21.286 --> 40:23.621
- Sam.
- Chef.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.957
- One final thing.
- Yes, Chef.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.593
Last year I put a young man
through culinary school.

40:28.626 --> 40:31.262
- Mm-hmm.
- And he's top of the class.

40:31.296 --> 40:34.065
If you're that serious
about doing it,

40:34.099 --> 40:35.967
I'd love to take care
of that for you.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.602
I'll pay the tuition.

40:37.635 --> 40:39.070
Thank you, Chef.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.172
Oh, my God.
That is amazing.

40:41.206 --> 40:42.773
That means everything to me.

40:42.807 --> 40:44.175
I can't wait to see
the progress.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.511
Thank you.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.479
Thank you, guys.
Good luck.

40:48.513 --> 40:50.515
- Keep working, Sam. Bye.
- Keep going, Sam.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.121
I'm saddened to be going home,

40:56.154 --> 40:59.624
but the Samantha that's leaving
learned to be confident.

40:59.657 --> 41:01.959
And that confidence comes
from Gordon, my mentor,

41:01.993 --> 41:04.295
believing in me enough
to help me pursue

41:04.329 --> 41:06.964
my culinary dreams
outside of this competition.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.467
When one door closes,
another door opens,

41:09.500 --> 41:11.469
and the door is opening

41:11.502 --> 41:13.771
on my future in this industry
and I'm so excited.

41:13.804 --> 41:15.206
Bye, guys.

41:22.747 --> 41:26.551
Narrator: Next time,
it's the two-hour
"MasterChef" finale.

41:26.584 --> 41:28.353
This season,
for the first time ever,

41:28.386 --> 41:30.521
we are battling each other

41:30.555 --> 41:34.159
to find the greatest home cook
in America.

41:34.192 --> 41:37.295
Narrator:
With each home cook mentored
by a different judge...

41:37.328 --> 41:40.731
- This is it.
- Cesar, Ashley, and Gerron,

41:40.765 --> 41:43.734
- Yeah!
- face off for a quarter
of a million dollars...

41:43.768 --> 41:45.870
- Whoop, whoop, baby.
- Whoop, whoop!

41:45.903 --> 41:48.406
...and the title of MasterChef.

41:48.439 --> 41:50.708
Gordon:
The winner is...

41:50.741 --> 41:52.743
( cheers and applause )
