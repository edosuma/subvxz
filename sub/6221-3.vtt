DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.089 --> 00:10.261
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.344 --> 00:13.097
His name, Merlin.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.934
(WATER DRIPPING)

00:38.915 --> 00:41.042
(CHANTING)

00:46.714 --> 00:48.633
(HEARTBEAT)

01:38.349 --> 01:40.518
(CONTINUES CHANTING)

02:25.313 --> 02:26.814
Aren't you scared?

02:26.897 --> 02:29.650
-Of what?
-That you might catch whatever it is.

02:29.734 --> 02:32.570
I'm the court physician, Merlin.
This is part of my job.

02:32.695 --> 02:34.905
Most of the time there's
nothing really to be scared of.

02:40.745 --> 02:41.954
You were saying?

02:42.621 --> 02:45.416
People mustn't see this...
They'll panic.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.761
Dad? Here's your sandwich...

03:00.181 --> 03:02.850
-Mmm, what's in it?
-It's smoked pigeon,

03:02.933 --> 03:05.811
but I'd say there's more smoke
than pigeon.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.855
You're such a good girl to me.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.483
And I've done you some
watercress soup tonight.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.986
Don't tell me...
With more water in it than cress?

03:15.780 --> 03:19.283
-I'll see you later.
-Okay. Bye.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.462
What are you doing?

03:31.545 --> 03:33.672
Just moving something.

03:33.798 --> 03:36.258
-Looks heavy.
-It's nothing really.

03:36.342 --> 03:39.553
-Someone got you flowers?
-No.

03:41.347 --> 03:43.808
Would you like one? A purple one.

03:44.517 --> 03:46.644
Purple suits you.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.563
Not that I'm saying
that red doesn't suit you.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.482
Thanks. Well...

03:55.653 --> 03:58.030
-See ya.
-Bye.

04:07.123 --> 04:08.707
You look happy.

04:08.833 --> 04:11.961
- I picked these for you.
-That's so sweet.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.922
Something to cheer you up,
| know you're not sleeping well.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.673
You cheer me up.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.010
Would you like me
to put them in water for you?

04:22.805 --> 04:25.891
I've never seen
anything like this before.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.476
Do you think it could
be some kind of plague?

04:27.560 --> 04:31.439
No, I fear that something like this
could never come from nature.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.399
But who has this kind of power?

04:33.899 --> 04:36.527
-You think it's caused by magic?
-ARTHUR: Merlin!

04:39.363 --> 04:42.074
I'm on my way. Sorry I'm late.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.827
Don't worry, I'm getting used to it.

04:46.829 --> 04:47.997
Oh, uh...

04:48.080 --> 04:50.332
Gwen. She gave it to me.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.918
Tell Gaius that my father
wants to see him now.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.171
Okay.

04:55.588 --> 04:57.298
-Gaius?
- I heard.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.091
Why couldn't he just tell you himself?

04:59.216 --> 05:01.469
"Cause that's the way it is,
you're a servant.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.137
If he knew who I was, what I've done...

05:03.220 --> 05:04.555
You'd be a dead servant.

05:06.682 --> 05:09.518
-Right. Get this covered up.
-Hey, I'm not your servant.

05:09.727 --> 05:12.563
No, you're my dogsbody.
Come on, hurry up.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.162
-What's happened to him?
- I don't know, sire.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.080
It's the second case I've seen today.

05:30.206 --> 05:31.582
Why didn't you report it to me?

05:31.707 --> 05:34.502
-I was attempting to find the cause.
-And what did you conclude?

05:34.585 --> 05:36.670
| don't think it's time
to hurry to conclusions.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.631
The scientific process is a long one.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.383
What are you concealing from me?

05:41.467 --> 05:43.844
Sire, I have seen nothing like it.

05:43.928 --> 05:47.139
The victims are dying in 24 hours
and it's spreading fast.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.475
So what is the cause?

05:49.600 --> 05:51.727
| think you should say the cause,

05:51.810 --> 05:55.648
the most likely cause, is sorcery.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.739
-You must find who did this.
- I will, Father.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.992
Conduct door-to-door searches,
increase your presence in the town.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.328
Double the guards on all the gates.

06:09.453 --> 06:12.081
-Lend the physician your servant.
-Merlin? But...

06:12.164 --> 06:14.291
We need Gaius to find a cure.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.460
He needs all the help we can give him.

06:16.585 --> 06:20.631
If Gaius is right, believe me,
this city will be wiped out.

06:22.341 --> 06:25.803
This is the kind of magic
that undermines our authority,

06:25.928 --> 06:27.513
challenges all we've done.

06:27.638 --> 06:32.476
If we cannot control this plague,
people will turn to magic for a cure.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.189
We have to find the sorcerer
and quickly.

06:38.274 --> 06:39.692
Yes, Father.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.380
Gaius? Gaius? He's still alive.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.925
I'm afraid there's nothing
we can do for him.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.093
But we haven't tried.

07:06.176 --> 07:09.263
If we don't know what the disease is
then how can we cure him?

07:09.346 --> 07:11.599
-With magic.
-Have a look.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.392
They're suspicious of everyone.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.145
This is not the time to be using magic.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.982
Science will lead us
to the source of the disease.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.781
What are you doing?

07:27.865 --> 07:31.201
I'm examining the contents
of that man's stomach.

07:31.994 --> 07:33.037
Will that tell you who did it?

07:33.162 --> 07:35.247
No, it'll tell us how it's spread.

07:35.372 --> 07:39.043
One thing I do know,
this is magic of the darkest kind.

07:39.710 --> 07:42.212
Why would someone use magic like that?

07:42.338 --> 07:46.467
Magic corrupts.
People use it for their own ends.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.802
But not all magic is bad.
| know it isn't.

07:48.886 --> 07:52.056
It's neither good nor bad.
It's how you use it.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.226
Over there. I'm sorry, Gaius.

07:56.352 --> 07:58.354
-We're searching every room in town.
-What for?

07:58.437 --> 08:01.023
-The sorcerer.
-And why would he be here?

08:01.106 --> 08:03.609
-I'm just doing my job.
-We've nothing to hide.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.944
Go on, then. Search.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.745
What are all these books and papers?

08:14.870 --> 08:17.373
My life's work. Dedicated to
the understanding of science.

08:17.456 --> 08:21.210
You're quite welcome
to read through them if you wish.

08:22.753 --> 08:25.631
-What's this room up here?
-It's mine.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.549
What do you expect to find in there?

08:27.633 --> 08:31.804
I'm looking for material or evidence
suggesting the use of enchantments.

08:31.929 --> 08:34.972
What have you done
with the magic book I gave you?

08:41.145 --> 08:43.273
ARTHUR: Merlin, come here.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.402
Look what I've found.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.407
I've found a place
where you could put things.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.242
It's called a cupboard.

09:36.869 --> 09:38.746
How long do you think it may be
before you find a cure?

09:38.829 --> 09:40.914
Depends on how many interruptions I get.

09:40.998 --> 09:44.042
Of course.
I'm sorry, we're finished here.

09:55.721 --> 09:59.349
-We have to hide that book.
-No, we must use it.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.476
Don't be stupid.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.603
If I have this legacy
then what is it for?

10:02.686 --> 10:04.938
You keep telling me
it's not for playing tricks.

10:05.022 --> 10:08.233
You want to practice magic
when the King is hunting for sorcerers?

10:08.358 --> 10:12.488
Are you mad? Merlin, your life's
destined for more important things.

10:12.571 --> 10:16.700
But what if I don't practice, then
how will I get to be this great warlock?

10:16.825 --> 10:20.037
There'll come a time
when your skills will be recognized.

10:20.162 --> 10:23.874
-When? How long do I have to wait?
-Patience is a virtue, Merlin.

10:23.999 --> 10:27.002
Sitting by and doing nothing,
that's a virtue?

10:27.085 --> 10:30.088
Your time will come.

10:30.214 --> 10:33.133
| could cure that man we saw.

10:33.217 --> 10:36.720
| know it's tempting
to use the way you find easiest, Merlin.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.222
It is when it would save a life.

10:38.347 --> 10:39.890
It's no good just saving one person.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.142
We have to discover
how this illness is spreading.

10:42.226 --> 10:44.770
Arthur is out there right now
looking for the sorcerer.

10:44.895 --> 10:47.147
A sorcerer who is
powerful enough to do this

10:47.231 --> 10:50.025
will never be found searching the town.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.071
So what can we do?

10:55.072 --> 10:59.076
Hope that science can find
the answer before it kills us all.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.210
(GROWLING)

11:22.933 --> 11:24.852
We've searched everywhere,
the entire city.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.604
-Nothing?
- I don't know where else to look.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.984
| want you to impose a curfew,

11:32.109 --> 11:35.529
no one is to be allowed on
the streets after the great bell.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.240
-Father.
-And cordon off the lower town.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.324
Why?

11:39.408 --> 11:41.368
Because that's where
most of the victims are.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.955
Let's isolate it.
Stop this disease from spreading.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.417
But what about
the people who live there?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.627
Don't you think I haven't considered it!

11:52.963 --> 11:54.506
What else can I do?

11:54.631 --> 11:56.842
| have to protect the rest of the city.

12:09.313 --> 12:12.190
GAIUS: What's different
about this victim?

12:12.316 --> 12:14.651
Uh, she's a woman.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.571
Sometimes I do wonder
whether your magical talents

12:17.654 --> 12:19.615
were given to the right person.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.283
Anything else?

12:23.327 --> 12:24.578
-She's a courtier?
-Ah.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.787
But how does that help us?

12:25.871 --> 12:28.373
Courtiers seldom go down
to the lower town.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.584
So what does that mean?

12:30.667 --> 12:33.879
That she hasn't spoken
to any townspeople...

12:34.004 --> 12:38.216
Yes. It suggests that the disease
is not spread by contact.

12:38.342 --> 12:41.845
-And they probably eat different food.
-Good. Anything else?

12:41.970 --> 12:44.056
| doubt they breathe the same air.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.892
So what's the only thing they do share?

12:47.851 --> 12:49.436
Water.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.772
Water. You think the disease
is spread through the water!

12:51.855 --> 12:54.024
Merlin, you're a prodigy.

13:07.746 --> 13:08.914
Time to get up, Dad.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.376
Dad?

13:15.837 --> 13:16.880
Gwen?

13:30.185 --> 13:33.522
Gwen? Gwen?

13:35.899 --> 13:37.401
-Gwen.
-Gaius.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.862
-You have the sickness?
-No. My father.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.864
Please, Gaius... He's all I have.

13:42.948 --> 13:46.827
-Gwen, I have no cure.
-I'm begging you.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.037
| wish there was something. Anything.

13:49.121 --> 13:52.582
But so far, the remedy
is beyond what I can achieve.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.585
I'm sorry, Gwen.

13:59.715 --> 14:01.967
-There must be something we can do?
-My best.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.094
Let's hope that this can
provide some answers.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.762
But that will be too late
for Gwen's father.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.931
| fear you may be right.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.784
(GAIUS SNORING)

15:24.216 --> 15:26.510
GUARD 1: What about that one? In there?

15:26.635 --> 15:28.678
GUARD 2: It's empty, sir.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.389

(DOOR CREAKING)

17:13.407 --> 17:16.286
Father! What's happened?

17:16.828 --> 17:18.622
| can't believe it.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.439
GAIUS: Don't touch it!

17:44.522 --> 17:47.067
| had this in the water
for no more than a few hours.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.193
Where was the water from?

17:48.318 --> 17:50.487
The pump from where the people
take their daily supply.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.489
ARTHUR: We have to stop
the people from using it.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.616
The city cannot survive without water.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.451
Then we have to find this sorcerer.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.536
| don't believe that
they're inside Camelot.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.288
Then extend the search to the villages.

18:00.372 --> 18:03.083
We've started.
| can't search the entire kingdom.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.669
And I can't stand by
and watch our people die.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.017
How's your father? Is he feeling better?

18:21.851 --> 18:25.021
Yeah, it's incredible. It's a miracle.

18:25.689 --> 18:28.483
-His skin's clear, back to normal?
-Yes.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.777
-Great.
-You don't seem surprised.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.571
No, no. I am. It's a miracle.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.492
But how did you know he was well?

18:40.495 --> 18:41.663
Because you're smiling.

18:41.746 --> 18:45.041
It's really weird because
| haven't told anyone, but you know.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.711
How could you know?

18:48.712 --> 18:51.715
Yeah, all right.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.760
You've finally found out...
I'll tell you...

18:58.054 --> 19:00.598
-I'm psychic.
-No, you're not.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.351
-It's true!
-All right, what am I thinking?

19:04.853 --> 19:07.564
-That I'm not psychic.
-You're strange.

19:09.024 --> 19:11.735
| don't mean that in a nasty way.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.404
You're just funny.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.782
| like that.

19:20.452 --> 19:21.911
I'm pleased for you.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.205
-Thank you.
-What for?

19:25.248 --> 19:26.541
| don't know, just for asking.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.251
| didn't like to see you upset.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.590
| have to get on.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.488
-The story is you were sick.
-Not anymore.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.616
Perhaps you were suffering
from some other ailment.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.327
You're joking. I felt like death itself.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.747
Not enough strength in me
to stir the air.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.124
Then what happened?

20:08.625 --> 20:11.378
| don't know. Suddenly, it was gone.

20:11.461 --> 20:14.672
-I'm fitter than I was before.
-That's remarkable.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.092
Was anybody with you
when all this happened?

20:17.675 --> 20:18.927
Just my daughter Gwen.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.510
(HUMMING)

21:07.016 --> 21:10.228
-Seize her.
-No!

21:11.062 --> 21:15.150
Guinevere, I am arresting you for crimes
in contravention to the laws of Camelot,

21:15.233 --> 21:17.485
-that you did practice enchantments.
-Gwen?

21:17.569 --> 21:19.737
What have I done?
| haven't done anything!

21:19.863 --> 21:21.948
-Help me! Please!
-What're you doing?

21:22.031 --> 21:25.076
-Found a magic poultice in her house.
-That's ridiculous.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.370
How else do you explain
her father's recovery?

21:27.537 --> 21:29.747
She is innocent. I know she is innocent.

21:29.873 --> 21:32.250
What can I do? I can't turn a blind eye.

21:34.169 --> 21:37.255
No, please. Listen to me.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.048
Please. I haven't done anything.

21:39.174 --> 21:41.134
You have to listen to me, please.

21:41.217 --> 21:45.263
I'm innocent, I swear. Let me go!

21:45.388 --> 21:47.807
| swear to you.

21:47.891 --> 21:51.269
Merlin! Merlin! Please help me.

21:51.394 --> 21:56.191
Why won't you listen to me?
Merlin, please...

21:59.777 --> 22:01.112
-What have you done?
-What?

22:01.237 --> 22:02.906
| warned you.

22:03.573 --> 22:06.326
Oh, I understand,
you thought you were doing good.

22:06.409 --> 22:09.078
| couldn't let her father die
knowing I could cure him.

22:09.204 --> 22:12.207
Did you not think it might look a bit
suspicious, the curing of one man?

22:12.290 --> 22:15.543
Then all I have to do is...
I'll cure everyone.

22:15.627 --> 22:17.754
No one will ever have to know
it was magic.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.173
It's too late.
They think Gwen's a sorceress,

22:20.256 --> 22:23.218
-they think she caused the disease.
-But she didn't!

22:24.052 --> 22:26.763
And how're you going to prove that?

22:34.854 --> 22:38.066
Please listen to me.
| have done nothing. Please.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.361
| swear I haven't done...

22:45.281 --> 22:48.284
-Well done.
-Why will no one believe me?

22:49.285 --> 22:53.122
He got better. He just recovered.
| didn't do anything.

22:53.206 --> 22:56.960
| believe you! Perhaps this is a disease
that is not always fatal.

22:57.085 --> 23:00.630
Have you thought of that?
Perhaps he recovered naturally.

23:00.755 --> 23:03.216
Then what of this poultice
that was found?

23:03.299 --> 23:06.219
What poultice?
| know nothing about a poultice.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.471
It was found in your house.

23:09.472 --> 23:12.892
Undo this enchantment.
Put an end to this contagion.

23:12.976 --> 23:15.728
-I can't.
-Then I can show you no mercy.

23:15.812 --> 23:19.148
| am not a witch.
| don't know how to stop the iliness.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.317
If you will not undo your sorcery,

23:21.442 --> 23:23.570
you force my hand
and I must find you guilty.

23:23.653 --> 23:26.489
It is therefore my duty
to pronounce judgment.

23:28.157 --> 23:30.910
And under the circumstance,
| have no choice

23:30.994 --> 23:33.663
-but to sentence you to death.
-No!

23:33.788 --> 23:38.084
| can only hope that when you die,
this evil plague dies with you.

23:38.167 --> 23:41.504
-Take her away.
-No, please, no.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.632
I'm innocent! Please, no.

23:45.258 --> 23:48.177
Please, help me. Please, I beg you.

23:52.015 --> 23:55.435
| know Gwen, she is my maidservant,
not an enchantress.

23:55.518 --> 23:57.937
Have you ever seen an enchantress?

23:58.021 --> 24:01.190
Believe me, they bear no sign, no mark.

24:01.316 --> 24:03.359
There is no sense of evil in the eye.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.778
| have seen the way the girl works.

24:05.862 --> 24:08.781
Her fingers are worn,
her nails are broken.

24:08.865 --> 24:11.534
If she was a sorceress,
why would she do this?

24:11.659 --> 24:15.288
Why would she kneel on a cold
stone floor morning after morning

24:15.371 --> 24:18.708
when she could make these things happen
with the snap of her fingers?

24:18.833 --> 24:20.960
-Like an idle king.
-You have no right...

24:21.044 --> 24:22.962
But you have the right
to cast a judgment!

24:23.046 --> 24:25.882
| have a responsibility
to take care of this kingdom.

24:28.009 --> 24:29.469
| take no pleasure in this.

24:29.552 --> 24:32.555
But you are sentencing the wrong person.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.725
She's right, Father. You hear
the word magic and you no longer listen.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.144
You saw it for yourself,
she used enchantments.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.813
Yes. Maybe.
But to save her dying father.

24:40.897 --> 24:43.149
That does not make her guilty
of creating a plague.

24:43.232 --> 24:45.818
One's the act of kindness, of love,
the other of evil.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.987
| don't believe
evil's in this girl's heart.

24:48.071 --> 24:50.657
| have witnessed what witchcraft can do,

24:50.740 --> 24:53.242
I've suffered at its hand.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.161
| cannot take that chance.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.580
If there is a slightest doubt
about this girl,

24:57.705 --> 24:59.999
she must die
or the whole kingdom may perish.

25:00.083 --> 25:02.418
| understand that.

25:02.543 --> 25:05.588
One day you may become king,

25:05.713 --> 25:10.677
then you will understand
such decisions must be made.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.096
There are dark forces
that threaten this kingdom.

25:13.221 --> 25:17.684
| know, witchcraft is an evil,
Father, so is injustice.

25:17.767 --> 25:20.853
Yes, I am yet to be king, and I don't
know what kind of king I will be.

25:20.937 --> 25:25.274
But I do have a sense of the kind
of Camelot I would wish to live in.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.735
It would be where
the punishment fits the crime.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.573
| fear you are right.

25:32.949 --> 25:36.619
She's played with fire
and, sadly, she must die by fire.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.136
| thought I was doing good.

25:54.637 --> 25:57.765
And that curing Gwen's father
would help her.

25:58.558 --> 26:02.437
| thought I was saving a life.

26:04.814 --> 26:08.151
It seemed so simple.

26:08.234 --> 26:11.320
An easy solution is like
a light in a storm, Merlin.

26:12.447 --> 26:14.157
Rush for it at your peril,

26:14.240 --> 26:17.160
for it may not always lead you
to a safe harbor.

26:17.285 --> 26:19.078
| can see that now.

26:19.162 --> 26:20.496
How many times have I warned you

26:20.621 --> 26:22.832
about the responsibilities
of being a warlock?

26:26.419 --> 26:28.004
| must see her.

26:43.019 --> 26:44.353
(SOBBING)

26:53.196 --> 26:54.489
Gwen.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.620
Thank you.

27:00.703 --> 27:03.122
-What for?
-For coming to see me.

27:03.706 --> 27:06.125
-I'm sorry.
-It's not your fault.

27:08.336 --> 27:11.047
It's all right. Don't worry about me.

27:11.672 --> 27:14.175
There's no point crying about it.

27:15.384 --> 27:19.055
| mean, I'm not saying that
you were going to cry about me.

27:19.180 --> 27:22.141
-Obviously, I don't think that.
-Oh, Gwen!

27:22.225 --> 27:24.644
-I can't have this happen.
-Please.

27:24.727 --> 27:27.688
One thing... You don't have to...

27:28.898 --> 27:30.066
But...

27:31.067 --> 27:32.235
What?

27:36.906 --> 27:38.574
Remember me.

27:40.409 --> 27:41.911
You're not going to die.

27:42.703 --> 27:45.414
I'm not going to let this happen.

27:55.842 --> 27:59.178
What if burning this witch
doesn't stop the poison?

27:59.262 --> 28:00.847
How do I protect my people?

28:00.930 --> 28:02.682
My men have closed down the water pumps.

28:02.765 --> 28:05.768
But the emergency supply
won't last for much longer.

28:05.852 --> 28:09.188
We have to find a way of
cleansing the water of the disease.

28:09.272 --> 28:11.357
-But how?
-Well...

28:12.441 --> 28:13.693
It was me!

28:14.610 --> 28:17.780
It was me who used magic
to cure Gwen's father.

28:19.949 --> 28:22.869
Gwen is not the sorcerer, I am!

28:24.370 --> 28:28.207
-Merlin! Are you mad?
-I cannot let her die for me.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.460
| place myself at your mercy.

28:31.586 --> 28:33.004
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

28:33.087 --> 28:34.297
| do.

28:35.631 --> 28:38.718
-Then arrest him.
-Father, please. I can't allow this.

28:38.801 --> 28:41.971
This is madness.
There's no way Merlin is a sorcerer.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.890
-Did you not hear him?
-Yes.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.225
He's admitted it.

28:46.309 --> 28:49.645
-He saved my life, remember.
-Why should he fabricate such a story?

28:50.980 --> 28:52.773
As Gaius said,

28:53.649 --> 28:59.989
he's got a grave mental disease.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.324
Really?

29:03.784 --> 29:05.828
-He's in love.
-What?

29:05.912 --> 29:08.331
-With Gwen.
-I am not!

29:08.414 --> 29:09.999
-Yes, you are.
-No way.

29:10.082 --> 29:13.669
| saw you yesterday
with that flower she'd given you.

29:14.420 --> 29:18.591
-I'm not in love with her.
-It's all right, you can admit it.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.426
| don't even think of her like that.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.261
Perhaps she cast a spell on you.

29:25.806 --> 29:26.974
(LAUGHS)

29:29.518 --> 29:31.520
Merlin is a wonder.

29:31.646 --> 29:35.191
But the wonder is
that he's such an idiot.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.653
There's no way he's a sorcerer.

29:39.612 --> 29:41.864
Don't waste my time again. Let him go.

29:53.793 --> 29:56.629
-Arthur's the idiot.
-No, he was right to do what he did.

29:56.712 --> 29:59.215
And thankfully he saved you
from your own stupidity.

29:59.298 --> 30:02.301
What else could I do?
It's my fault Gwen is going to die.

30:02.385 --> 30:06.055
Yes. But you don't prove her innocence
by offering to jump into the flames.

30:06.138 --> 30:09.725
You do it by finding out
what's causing the disease.

30:09.850 --> 30:13.813
Whatever it is, one thing's for sure,
Arthur's not going to find it.

30:13.896 --> 30:16.482
He thinks he is so sharp.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.652
Even when I told him I was a wizard,
he still couldn't see it.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.904
Sometimes it's pretty hard to spot.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.323
Maybe I should go around
wearing a pointy hat.

30:24.407 --> 30:27.410
| don't think you'd find one big enough.
Anyway, forget that.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.662
If we're going to save Gwen,
we have to find out

30:29.745 --> 30:31.747
what's contaminating the water.

31:16.292 --> 31:19.628
The water from here
supplies the whole town.

31:19.712 --> 31:21.547
Take a sample.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.476
(LOW GROWLING)

31:40.483 --> 31:42.902
Let's take it back and examine it.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.405
(ROARING)

31:49.492 --> 31:51.494
What the hell was that?

31:53.996 --> 31:55.164
Here!

31:56.832 --> 31:58.501
It was an Afanc.

31:58.959 --> 32:02.171
-An... A what?
-A beast born of clay,

32:02.296 --> 32:05.508
and conjured up only by
the most powerful sorcerer.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.845
Now we have to find a way to defeat it.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.765
But where?

32:12.848 --> 32:14.517
That'd take days.
Gwen will be dead by then.

32:14.642 --> 32:16.811
Have you got a better idea?

32:41.043 --> 32:42.211
Gwen.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.549
I'm going to get you out.

32:48.217 --> 32:49.510
| will.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.324
Hello!

33:16.245 --> 33:17.580
DRAGON: Hello!

33:19.915 --> 33:24.336
The great warlock returns,
as I knew he would.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.589
| need to know how to defeat an Afanc.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.924
Yes, I suppose you do.

33:29.425 --> 33:30.926
Will you help me?

33:32.761 --> 33:36.182
Trust the elements
that are at your command.

33:37.266 --> 33:40.769
Elements? But what is it I have to do?

33:40.895 --> 33:43.522
You cannot do this alone.

33:43.606 --> 33:48.611
You are but one side of a coin,
Arthur is the other.

33:48.736 --> 33:52.698
| don't understand.
Just tell me what it is I have to do.

33:53.616 --> 33:54.742
No!

33:56.452 --> 33:58.704
Please, help me.

33:59.413 --> 34:01.123
| have.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.626
(LAUGHING)

34:06.378 --> 34:08.630
Oh, yeah, right. Thanks.

34:19.641 --> 34:22.143
Have you found anything more?

34:22.268 --> 34:23.646
I've tried.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.983
| can keep looking.

34:28.609 --> 34:31.612
People are dying.
We can't delay any longer.

34:33.155 --> 34:34.489
We must kill the witch.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.742
Bring her execution forward to tonight.

34:52.675 --> 34:56.011
-Merlin, what are you doing?
-Looking for a book.

34:56.971 --> 35:00.766
-Care to tell me which one?
-A book on elements.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.851
-Elements?
-Yes.

35:02.977 --> 35:04.937
-Which one would I find them in?
-Most of them.

35:05.020 --> 35:09.108
The study of base elements is at the
very heart of the scientific process.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.277
But how'll they help me kill the Afanc?

35:11.360 --> 35:14.196
Well, the Afanc is a creature
made from earth and water.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.533
-That's two of the four base elements.
-What about the other two?

35:18.325 --> 35:20.452
Well, perhaps they will destroy it.

35:20.536 --> 35:22.997
You want fire. Wind and fire.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.959
-How did you find this out?
- I just knew.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.712
-It's part of my powers.
-What else do your powers tell you?

35:29.837 --> 35:33.549
That I am only one side of a coin.
The brighter side, obviously.

35:33.674 --> 35:37.219
-And who is the other side?
- I think that might be Arthur.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.555
They're bringing forward the execution.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.807
-We have to prove Gwen's innocence.
-We're trying.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.059
Please, just tell me
what I can do to help.

35:44.143 --> 35:46.228
-We need Arthur.
-Arthur?

35:46.353 --> 35:48.480
There's a monster, an Afanc,
in the water supply.

35:48.564 --> 35:51.317
-That's what's causing the plague.
-We must tell Uther.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.319
The Afanc's a creature forged by magic.

35:53.402 --> 35:54.903
Telling Uther wouldn't save Gwen.

35:54.987 --> 35:57.156
He'll blame her for conjuring it.

35:57.239 --> 35:59.074
-So what are we to do?
-We need to destroy it

35:59.158 --> 36:02.661
then the plague will stop
and Uther may see sense.

36:02.745 --> 36:06.415
-And that's why you need Arthur.
-He's our best chance,

36:06.540 --> 36:09.251
but he won't want to disobey the king.

36:10.586 --> 36:12.254
Leave that to me.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.850
Are you all right?

36:25.351 --> 36:28.771
I'm sorry about all this.
Merlin's not been in today.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.898
-Poor Merlin.
-Yeah.

36:31.732 --> 36:34.526
To offer to give up his life
to save Gwen's.

36:34.610 --> 36:37.613
| certainly can't imagine
any man loving me so much.

36:37.738 --> 36:40.616
No, I certainly can't
imagine that either.

36:40.741 --> 36:43.118
That's because you're not like Merlin,

36:43.202 --> 36:45.037
he's a lover.

36:45.120 --> 36:49.875
Yeah, maybe that's because I haven't
found the right person to love.

36:50.292 --> 36:52.795
Sadly, the age of gallantry
seems to be dead.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.797
You look around
and all you see are small men,

36:54.922 --> 36:57.466
not big enough to fill their armor.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.969
There's not one of them that's
able to stand up for what is right.

37:02.763 --> 37:03.972
What do you want me to do?

37:32.584 --> 37:35.462
You'd better be
right about this, Merlin.

37:40.426 --> 37:41.677
(FAINT SNARLING)

37:49.810 --> 37:52.604
-You should stay here.
-I'm coming with you.

37:52.688 --> 37:54.606
-No.
-Scared I'll show you up?

37:54.690 --> 37:57.359
Father will slam us both in chains
if he knew I'd endangered you.

37:57.484 --> 37:58.694
Good thing he doesn't know about it.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.530
I'm telling you, Morgana, turn back.
You could get hurt.

38:01.655 --> 38:04.366
So could you,
if you don't get out of my way.

38:11.999 --> 38:16.295
-How are we going to find it?
-Just hope we do before it finds us.

38:16.879 --> 38:18.213
(SNARLING)

38:18.297 --> 38:19.715
-Stop.
-What?

38:24.011 --> 38:25.804
It's just a shadow.

38:33.854 --> 38:35.397
(LOW GROWLING)

38:46.158 --> 38:47.576
Spread out.

39:04.426 --> 39:06.011
(SNARLING)

39:12.100 --> 39:13.602
(ROARING)

39:18.732 --> 39:21.276
-MORGANA: What is it? Are you all right?
-Yeah.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.111
-Did you see it?
-Yes.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.030
-What does it look like?
-It's quick.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.448
(SCREAMS)

39:36.959 --> 39:38.460
Where is it?

39:42.297 --> 39:43.757
| think it's gone this way.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.282
Arthur, use the torch!

40:52.534 --> 40:54.703
(MERLIN CHANTING)

41:04.004 --> 41:05.547
(AFANC HOWLING)

41:14.306 --> 41:15.474
Merlin!

41:18.518 --> 41:21.063
(CHUCKLING) This is really good.

41:24.232 --> 41:28.236
Good news, sire, there are no new deaths
and those that are sick are recovering.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.488
Good.

41:30.405 --> 41:33.492
Strange, I've never heard
of an Afanc before.

41:33.575 --> 41:36.495
It's conjured from clay
by powerful magic.

41:37.037 --> 41:40.165
The type that can only be invoked
by an ancient sorcerer,

41:40.916 --> 41:44.544
one who has the power
to mirror the spirit of life.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.673
| found this at the water source.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.718
It bears the mark of Nimueh.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.098
No!

41:57.265 --> 41:58.892
We must be vigilant, sire.

42:01.770 --> 42:04.773
-Will I never be rid of her?
-Sire...

42:04.856 --> 42:06.191
Leave me.

42:25.085 --> 42:26.378
Dad!

42:27.295 --> 42:28.630
Oh, my baby.

42:30.799 --> 42:34.469
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me, it was more Merlin.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.639
-Really?
-He's the real hero here.

42:38.140 --> 42:41.476
-I don't know what to say.
- I didn't do anything.

42:42.978 --> 42:45.772
I'm grateful to you all. Come on, Gwen.

42:48.442 --> 42:53.238
Merlin? I wanted you to know,
your secret is safe with me.

42:54.614 --> 42:57.242
-My secret?
-Come on, don't pretend.

42:57.325 --> 42:59.578
- I know what you did.
-You do?

42:59.661 --> 43:02.247
-I saw it with my own eyes.
-You did?

43:02.330 --> 43:04.332
| understand why
you don't want anyone to know.

43:04.416 --> 43:07.669
-Well, obviously...
-But I won't tell anyone.

43:08.962 --> 43:10.756
You don't mind me
talking to you about it?

43:13.258 --> 43:14.676
No, it's...

43:15.302 --> 43:18.680
You have no idea
how hard it is to keep this hidden.

43:18.764 --> 43:20.766
Well, you can continue to deny it,

43:20.849 --> 43:23.185
but I think Gwen's a very lucky woman.

43:23.268 --> 43:26.146
-Gwen?
-It's our secret.

43:30.358 --> 43:31.526
(SIGHS)

43:38.950 --> 43:41.620
This fish didn't come
from the water, did it?

43:41.703 --> 43:44.039
Well, where else
is it going to come from?

43:44.164 --> 43:46.625
The water's fine now.
That's not your worry.

43:46.708 --> 43:49.878
This was the work
of a very powerful sorcerer.

43:49.961 --> 43:52.380
| hope you didn't come to her attention.

43:52.464 --> 43:55.634
Doubt it. No one else
seems to appreciate my skills.

43:55.717 --> 43:58.136
| just want someone
to see me for who I am.

43:58.220 --> 44:01.056
One day, Merlin, one day.

44:02.724 --> 44:03.892
One day what?

44:04.017 --> 44:07.896
One day, people won't believe
what an idiot you were.

44:13.318 --> 44:14.569
Thanks.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.753
Merlin, you will pay for this.

44:38.009 --> 44:39.678
Merlin!

44:39.761 --> 44:41.763
ARTHUR: If ] don't get the antidote,
what happens to Merlin?

44:41.888 --> 44:43.348
He will die.

44:48.687 --> 44:49.938
His pulse is weaker.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.568
GWEN: His fever's getting worse.

44:55.902 --> 44:56.945
(CHANTS)

44:57.070 --> 44:58.280
He's dead.
