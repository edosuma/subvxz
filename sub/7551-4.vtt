00:26.609 --> 00:29.545
Oh, my God, ice cream?
Are you trying to kill me?

00:29.579 --> 00:31.746
At least you'll die happy.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.048
Oh...

00:33.082 --> 00:34.783
- Kate?
- Mm!

00:34.817 --> 00:36.411
Oh, no, thanks, I couldn't, not after this

00:36.431 --> 00:38.024
amazing meal that you
guys just stuffed us with.

00:38.044 --> 00:40.196
Oh... darling, I'm sorry.
Dessert is not optional,

00:40.216 --> 00:42.191
not after I traipsed all over town

00:42.225 --> 00:44.393
to find Richard his favorite
flavor of ice cream.

00:44.427 --> 00:45.560
Potato chip fudge?

00:45.595 --> 00:47.396
Yes!

00:47.430 --> 00:49.097
Beckett, dig deep.

00:49.131 --> 00:51.767
Come... you would not quit
at mile 25 of a marathon.

00:52.282 --> 00:54.135
You know what? Why don't we take a break

00:54.169 --> 00:55.570
- and you and I do dishes?
- Oh...

00:55.605 --> 00:57.238
Oh, don't even think about it.

00:57.273 --> 00:59.522
Gram and I have it covered.

01:00.249 --> 01:01.409
Okay.

01:03.212 --> 01:05.078
You are
not letting them do dishes

01:05.114 --> 01:06.680
after they just cooked.

01:06.715 --> 01:08.680
- They want to.
- You're seriously milking this whole

01:08.700 --> 01:10.818
"I've been missing for two months thing,"
aren't you?

01:10.852 --> 01:12.853
They are glad to have me back,

01:12.888 --> 01:15.390
and if fussing over me makes them happy...

01:15.424 --> 01:17.158
enjoy it.

01:17.192 --> 01:19.693
Like you ought to be enjoying this

01:19.728 --> 01:21.529
potato chip fudge ice cream sundae.

01:21.563 --> 01:24.097
It's got that whole
salty/sweet thing going on.

01:24.132 --> 01:25.633
It's just... just like me.

01:29.738 --> 01:30.838
Mmm!

01:34.142 --> 01:36.109
- I'll... I'll get yeah. I'll get it.
- Mm.

01:36.144 --> 01:38.111
Beckett's phone.

01:45.124 --> 01:46.853
Look,
I know that you've only been back

01:46.887 --> 01:50.564
for a few weeks,
and we're all still trying to process it,

01:50.584 --> 01:52.625
but I gotta say,

01:52.660 --> 01:54.360
Alexis waiting on you hand and foot...

01:54.394 --> 01:56.622
it's just it's a little odd.

01:56.642 --> 01:58.149
Hey, you know what's really odd?

01:58.165 --> 02:00.333
Ice cream truck in the middle of nowhere.

02:00.368 --> 02:02.669
There's no kids lining up to
buy bomb pops around here.

02:02.703 --> 02:04.738
Yeah,
this couldn't have been the driver's route.

02:04.772 --> 02:06.306
Not even close. I just got off the phone

02:06.340 --> 02:07.740
with the owner of the ice cream truck...

02:07.775 --> 02:09.208
Sergei Vetotchkin.

02:09.243 --> 02:11.878
The victim is his son... Anton, 22.

02:11.912 --> 02:14.113
They found him behind the
wheel around 5:00 p.m.

02:14.148 --> 02:15.815
Is nothing sacred?

02:15.849 --> 02:17.316
I mean, who kills an ice cream man,

02:17.350 --> 02:19.018
a symbol of childhood innocence?

02:19.052 --> 02:21.301
Maybe someone wanted his money.

02:21.321 --> 02:24.556
Except that today's cash
receipts were still in the van.

02:24.591 --> 02:26.925
And whoever did this
shot him at close range.

02:26.959 --> 02:30.228
Two g.s.w.s to the chest with powder burns.

02:30.263 --> 02:31.863
We figure the shooter boarded the truck

02:31.898 --> 02:34.866
and shot Anton,
knocking him back into the shifter.

02:34.901 --> 02:37.102
Went into first,
and that's why the truck rolled here.

02:37.136 --> 02:38.970
Killer probably bolted out the back.

02:39.644 --> 02:40.505
Anyone see it?

02:40.539 --> 02:42.473
We got unis canvassing for witnesses,

02:42.508 --> 02:44.843
but it's not exactly an
area where people hang out.

02:44.877 --> 02:46.444
And what about street cams?

02:46.478 --> 02:48.980
Coverage is spotty.
We'll get really lucky if we get a hit.

02:49.015 --> 02:52.250
What was this kid doing
here in the first place?

02:52.285 --> 02:54.686
I don't know why our son
would be in that neighborhood.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.521
That's not where we do business.

02:56.555 --> 02:58.055
Well, is it possible that he was involved

02:58.089 --> 02:59.857
in something that would
take him down there,

02:59.891 --> 03:01.158
something dangerous?

03:01.193 --> 03:04.228
No. Anton was... A good boy.

03:04.262 --> 03:05.563
Never got in trouble.

03:05.597 --> 03:08.232
Were there any troubles on his route?

03:08.266 --> 03:11.669
Anything unusual going on in his life?

03:11.704 --> 03:13.670
He came home early from school.

03:13.705 --> 03:15.572
What school did he go to?

03:15.606 --> 03:18.408
He was taking night classes
at the community college

03:18.443 --> 03:20.711
in the Bronx for graphic design.

03:20.745 --> 03:24.761
Since he was a boy in Abkhazia,
he loved to draw.

03:24.897 --> 03:28.085
But last night, he came back from class

03:28.119 --> 03:31.842
very upset, like something was wrong.

03:32.512 --> 03:34.791
Yeah,
there was definitely something wrong.

03:34.826 --> 03:37.389
I'd never seen Anton like that before.

03:37.613 --> 03:39.162
Could you tell us what happened?

03:39.196 --> 03:41.398
Yeah, I'd given the class an assignment,

03:41.432 --> 03:44.434
and Anton was working at his
station like everyone else,

03:44.469 --> 03:46.736
and all of a sudden he started shaking

03:46.770 --> 03:49.272
- like he was terrified.
- Because of what?

03:49.306 --> 03:52.175
I don't know. He ran out of the room.

03:52.209 --> 03:54.277
But I saw him later in the parking lot

03:54.311 --> 03:56.479
getting into a car with some guy.

03:56.513 --> 03:57.813
What guy? Can you describe him?

03:57.848 --> 04:00.149
No, it was too dark, but...

04:00.184 --> 04:01.817
I-I do remember the car.

04:01.852 --> 04:04.567
It was bright green, an old Camry.

04:04.587 --> 04:06.288
Did you happen to get a license plate?

04:06.322 --> 04:10.593
I-I got a 3, an "E," and a "K."

04:10.627 --> 04:12.661
You said this all started
when he was at his station.

04:12.696 --> 04:15.264
Can we take a look at
what he was working on?

04:15.298 --> 04:18.434
Uh, yeah. I have to log you
into the system.

04:27.377 --> 04:29.011
What the...

04:29.045 --> 04:30.545
his portfolio is gone and all his...

04:30.579 --> 04:32.281
projects have been deleted.

04:32.315 --> 04:34.516
Did Anton delete them?
Why would he do that?

04:34.550 --> 04:36.951
I have no idea.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.988
It's C.S.U. Ryan.

04:47.530 --> 04:49.230
Ryan?

04:49.264 --> 04:52.333
Hey. C.S.U. Got us a lead.

04:52.367 --> 04:54.835
See how this cabinet door is open?

04:54.869 --> 04:57.171
Just like in these crime scene photos.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.643
Okay. So?

05:02.677 --> 05:05.980
So when the cabinet door is closed...

05:06.014 --> 05:09.115
There's blood spatter on
the door panel behind it.

05:09.150 --> 05:11.452
Which means the door was
closed when Anton was shot.

05:11.486 --> 05:14.220
Yep. Now, see this smear of blood

05:14.255 --> 05:15.856
on the inside edge of the door?

05:15.890 --> 05:17.591
C.S.U. Said that this came from a finger,

05:17.625 --> 05:21.127
so somebody grabbed the
door from the inside,

05:21.162 --> 05:22.463
pulling it open.

05:22.497 --> 05:24.698
If someone was in there
when Anton was shot...

05:24.732 --> 05:27.000
- They saw our killer.
- A witness.

05:27.034 --> 05:29.235
Yeah, not only that,
I think our witness might be a kid.

05:29.270 --> 05:30.703
What?

05:30.737 --> 05:33.139
They left that on the
inside of the cabinet.

05:33.174 --> 05:35.842
It's a permission slip for a class trip.

05:35.876 --> 05:37.978
No usable prints on it,

05:38.012 --> 05:39.812
but it does have today's date.

05:39.847 --> 05:41.081
Kennedy elementary.

05:41.115 --> 05:42.648
That's less than a mile away.

05:42.683 --> 05:44.316
Assuming an afternoon dismissal,

05:44.351 --> 05:46.118
Anton was shot at 5:00 p.m.

05:46.152 --> 05:49.464
Someone from that school was in
this van when Anton was killed.

05:50.916 --> 05:54.378
Someone from miss Ruiz's
second grade class.

05:55.428 --> 05:58.163
I can't imagine it's
one of Mrs. Ruiz's students.

05:58.198 --> 06:00.099
Why would they even be in that area alone?

06:00.133 --> 06:01.733
Well,
we'll know more once our youth officer

06:01.767 --> 06:03.102
is done talking to them.

06:03.136 --> 06:04.536
Now, what time did...

06:04.570 --> 06:06.571
Mrs. Ruiz's
class let out yesterday?

06:06.606 --> 06:08.840
At 3:00 p.m., and each child was picked up

06:08.875 --> 06:10.476
by a parent or authorized guardian.

06:10.510 --> 06:13.312
Okay, and I'm gonna need a
list of all of their names

06:13.346 --> 06:15.246
so we can determine where
they were at 5:00 P.M.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.749
Of course. Detective Beckett?

06:17.783 --> 06:19.985
Mrs. Ruiz and I talked to all the students.

06:20.019 --> 06:21.520
None of them seems to be your witness.

06:21.554 --> 06:23.087
Except one of them has to be.

06:24.456 --> 06:26.190
You know,
maybe we should talk to them again.

06:26.225 --> 06:28.527
If they're afraid to come forward,
that's not gonna help.

06:28.561 --> 06:30.595
Or perhaps they didn't see anything.

06:30.630 --> 06:32.230
Either way,
these children shouldn't be subjected

06:32.264 --> 06:33.831
to endless questions. I know, I understand,

06:33.865 --> 06:35.733
but we have to find this witness.

06:35.767 --> 06:38.569
In cases like this,
a child is often more likely

06:38.603 --> 06:41.372
to open up to somebody who's
not an authority figure...

06:41.407 --> 06:43.569
a classmate, a friend.

06:44.115 --> 06:47.478
So, basically, we're looking for someone

06:47.513 --> 06:49.013
who won't intimidate them.

06:49.047 --> 06:51.582
An adult presence in the classroom

06:51.616 --> 06:53.784
that 8-year-olds will view as a peer,

06:53.818 --> 06:56.253
someone that they can
consider one of their own?

06:56.287 --> 06:58.756
Okay, but where would we
find someone like that?

06:58.790 --> 07:00.290
Got it.

07:00.324 --> 07:01.458
Easy.

07:07.782 --> 07:10.014

07:14.721 --> 07:16.089
Thank you, Mrs. Ruiz,

07:16.123 --> 07:18.672
for letting Castle spend
time in your classroom.

07:18.692 --> 07:20.473
I wasn't given much of a choice.

07:20.493 --> 07:23.161
Well, then we apologize for the imposition,

07:23.196 --> 07:25.864
but we do need to figure
out who this witness is.

07:25.898 --> 07:27.265
And just how are you going to do that?

07:27.300 --> 07:28.800
You know we spoke to all of them already,
right?

07:28.834 --> 07:31.335
Yes, but being 90% kid myself,

07:31.370 --> 07:35.039
I have an ability to get
into the minds of children.

07:35.073 --> 07:36.674
And I have the perfect plan.

07:36.709 --> 07:39.644
Trust me, there is no such thing.

07:39.678 --> 07:41.112
Have you ever been in a room

07:41.146 --> 07:42.814
with 20 second-graders, Mr. Castle?

07:42.848 --> 07:44.549
I appreciate your concern, Leslie.

07:44.583 --> 07:45.616
May I call you Leslie?

07:45.650 --> 07:48.052
- "Mrs. Ruiz" is fine.
- Excellent.

07:48.086 --> 07:50.354
I'm sure I'm more than capable of handling

07:50.389 --> 07:53.057
anything these little
charmers can throw my way.

07:53.091 --> 07:54.625
Hmm.

07:59.564 --> 08:01.366
In this case, is an eraser.

08:05.169 --> 08:06.469
Hey, what do you got?

08:06.504 --> 08:09.000
We chased down that partial plate
that Anton's teacher gave us.

08:09.020 --> 08:10.541
That car she saw?

08:10.575 --> 08:13.644
Looks like it's registered to a retired cop
named Clark Jaffe.

08:13.678 --> 08:15.412
- A cop?
- Yeah.

08:15.446 --> 08:17.814
Anton placed a call to him that night from

08:17.849 --> 08:18.881
the pay phone outside the college.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.150
Okay, bring him in.

08:20.184 --> 08:21.251
That's gonna be a problem.

08:21.285 --> 08:23.386
Jaffe's dead. Shot to death.

08:23.421 --> 08:26.356
He was shot, too? When?

08:26.390 --> 08:28.691
Yesterday, about eight hours before Anton.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.993
And I ran ballistics. It's a match.

08:31.028 --> 08:32.727
It's the same shooter.

08:32.763 --> 08:35.197
Okay. I'm on my way.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.001
Hey, everybody. Atten...

08:39.035 --> 08:41.736
Attention, everyone! Hello! Attention!

08:43.440 --> 08:45.274
Guys.

08:46.030 --> 08:47.043
Class.

08:50.914 --> 08:52.548
Neat trick.

08:52.582 --> 08:53.848
Children, this is Mr. Castle.

08:53.883 --> 08:56.118
He's gonna be helping
me with today's lessons.

08:56.152 --> 08:59.754
Good morning, Mr. Castle.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.891
Okay, Columbo. You're on.

09:04.327 --> 09:05.927
Right.

09:08.564 --> 09:10.264
Good morning, class.

09:10.299 --> 09:13.201
Does anyone here know what a writer is?

09:13.235 --> 09:15.216
- Yes?
- A writer writes stories.

09:15.236 --> 09:17.171
That's exactly right.

09:17.206 --> 09:19.774
And... who here knows a writer?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.309
This is boring!

09:21.343 --> 09:23.645
Mrs. Ruiz said I can
show-and-tell my instant camera!

09:23.679 --> 09:25.438
Maybe later, Jason.

09:26.729 --> 09:27.915
Yes?

09:27.949 --> 09:30.384
Mr. Castle, aren't you a writer?

09:30.419 --> 09:32.286
Well, as a matter of fact, I am.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.521
Are you famous?

09:33.555 --> 09:35.490
Well,
I don't know if I'd use the word "famous."

09:35.524 --> 09:37.325
- Some people...
- My dad says your books suck.

09:45.133 --> 09:46.867
Mr. Castle!

09:46.901 --> 09:48.669
We do not make faces in my classroom.

09:48.703 --> 09:49.837
He started it!

09:49.871 --> 09:52.506
Boo!

09:52.540 --> 09:53.974
You said you had a plan?

09:54.009 --> 09:57.511
Yes, yes, I have a plan.

09:58.190 --> 10:02.062
Aside from me, does anyone here
know another writer?

10:03.496 --> 10:07.199
Tell you what. Everyone look to your left.

10:07.234 --> 10:08.868
You're looking at a writer.

10:08.902 --> 10:11.136
Except for you guys on the end.
You're looking at the wall.

10:13.039 --> 10:15.064
We are all writers.

10:15.084 --> 10:18.677
If you can tell a story,
you can write a story.

10:20.312 --> 10:22.063
So...

10:22.782 --> 10:25.617
Let's do that right now.
Let's write a story.

10:25.651 --> 10:27.519
It can be about a little boy

10:27.553 --> 10:29.454
or a little girl, just like you.

10:29.489 --> 10:33.057
It can be as silly or as
scary as you want it to be.

10:33.092 --> 10:35.159
Can I write about having a tea party?

10:35.194 --> 10:36.527
Of course you can.

10:36.561 --> 10:39.563
Mr. Castle, is it okay to make things up?

10:39.598 --> 10:41.332
Of course, yes. You can make things up,

10:41.367 --> 10:43.902
or you could, um, you could write it

10:43.936 --> 10:46.645
based on something that
happened in real life.

10:48.072 --> 10:50.443
Is everyone ready?

10:53.433 --> 10:54.898
Uh, go!

11:01.820 --> 11:03.421
We found a link between our two vics?

11:03.455 --> 11:05.556
Other than Anton getting
in Jaffe's car that night,

11:05.590 --> 11:07.857
not so far, and Anton's never
been in trouble with the law.

11:07.892 --> 11:10.760
- You talk to Anton's parents?
- Yeah, they never heard of Jaffe.

11:10.795 --> 11:11.929
I'm telling you, these guys,

11:11.963 --> 11:13.230
they lived in different neighborhoods,

11:13.264 --> 11:14.431
they moved in different circles.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.799
They drive off together,

11:15.833 --> 11:17.767
and then the next day
they both end up dead?

11:17.802 --> 11:20.003
They're connected.
We just gotta find out how.

11:20.038 --> 11:22.472
I got something else.
After Clark Jaffe was killed,

11:22.506 --> 11:24.273
someone tossed his place.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.242
Killer was looking for something.

11:32.416 --> 11:34.551
If you don't hydrate,
they'll eat you alive.

11:34.585 --> 11:37.720
Ah, thank you. That's very kind.

11:37.755 --> 11:39.722
So, how are those stories they wrote?

11:39.757 --> 11:41.490
Oh, and feel free to use my desk.

11:41.524 --> 11:44.226
I was... I just...

11:44.861 --> 11:47.417
You don't like me very much, do you?

11:47.566 --> 11:50.066
That's not it, Mr. Castle.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.733
These are kids,

11:51.768 --> 11:54.337
and it's my job to protect them,

11:54.371 --> 11:56.538
even from people who mean well.

11:57.841 --> 12:00.709
Besides, if one of them did see something,

12:00.743 --> 12:02.210
they're too afraid to come forward.

12:02.244 --> 12:04.112
So why would you expect
them to write about?

12:04.146 --> 12:06.643
Well, I don't. Well, not directly.

12:06.663 --> 12:08.851
But an experience that powerful

12:08.885 --> 12:11.553
is going to find a way to express itself

12:11.588 --> 12:13.054
and end up on the page.

12:13.089 --> 12:17.125
Even the wildest fantasy is
based on a kernel of truth.

12:17.159 --> 12:19.995
As a master storyteller,
I'm able to separate

12:20.029 --> 12:22.130
the make-believe from the telltale details

12:22.164 --> 12:23.698
of thinly veiled fact.

12:23.732 --> 12:26.034
You mark my words, Mrs. Ruiz...

12:26.068 --> 12:28.470
somewhere in this pile is the key

12:28.504 --> 12:30.337
to identifying our witness.

12:38.914 --> 12:41.148
I followed up on Jaffe's car.

12:41.182 --> 12:43.417
There's no G.P.S., no E.Z. pass.

12:43.451 --> 12:44.919
There's no way of finding out

12:44.953 --> 12:46.720
where he and Anton went that night.

12:46.754 --> 12:48.755
Okay, what about you on financials?

12:48.789 --> 12:50.857
For an ex-cop, the guy lived like a monk.

12:50.892 --> 12:53.093
So did Anton, which is part of our problem.

12:53.128 --> 12:55.896
The kid had no cell phone,
no credit cards to pull.

12:55.930 --> 12:57.464
There's got to be a connection
between these two guys.

12:57.499 --> 12:59.066
I'm just not finding it.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.433
But here's what I don't get...

13:00.453 --> 13:02.636
what's a 22-year-old ice cream man

13:02.670 --> 13:03.904
doing with an ex-cop, anyway?

13:03.938 --> 13:05.104
I may have a lead on that.

13:05.139 --> 13:07.073
I was looking into the ice cream truck.

13:07.107 --> 13:09.042
It was ticketed last
week up on Marble Hill,

13:09.076 --> 13:11.545
- which is nowhere near Anton's route.
- So?

13:11.579 --> 13:14.447
So I checked into Clark Jaffe's financials.

13:14.481 --> 13:16.482
Jaffe's credit card shows
that he parked at a meter

13:16.517 --> 13:19.318
the exact same block on the same day.

13:20.384 --> 13:23.156
That's not a coincidence.

13:23.190 --> 13:26.592
This is traffic cam footage
of Anton's truck that day.

13:26.626 --> 13:28.661
Now watch.

13:34.334 --> 13:36.035
He goes into that shipping store.

13:36.069 --> 13:37.570
What's he doing in there?

13:37.604 --> 13:39.939
I have no idea.
But I scrubbed all the footage.

13:39.973 --> 13:42.050
This is from an hour earlier.

13:44.410 --> 13:47.279
A green Camry.

13:47.313 --> 13:49.481
And that's Clark Jaffe.

13:50.490 --> 13:52.984
Going into the same store.

13:53.018 --> 13:55.320
So what were the two of them doing?

13:57.002 --> 13:58.702
I found it!

13:58.722 --> 14:00.459
I think I found our witness!

14:00.493 --> 14:03.161
Right here. It's Jack.

14:03.196 --> 14:05.430
He wrote a story about an evil giant,

14:05.465 --> 14:07.132
which, from a child's perspective,

14:07.166 --> 14:08.866
is how the killer would seem.

14:08.901 --> 14:11.535
He said that the giant spoke in a loud,
angry voice,

14:11.570 --> 14:15.172
said mean things,
and promised he would hurt someone.

14:15.207 --> 14:17.108
That's just "Jack and the beanstalk."

14:17.142 --> 14:19.844
Yes, but in this story,
the giant had a gun.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.847
Okay. Let's say you're right.

14:22.881 --> 14:25.049
Let's say Jack was hiding
in the ice cream truck,

14:25.084 --> 14:26.683
and he's afraid to tell anyone.

14:26.718 --> 14:28.619
How are you gonna get him to tell you?

14:39.097 --> 14:41.499
Keep moving! Move up!

14:41.533 --> 14:42.933
Hold back, guys! Cover me!

14:42.967 --> 14:44.701
Got 'em!

14:44.736 --> 14:46.503
Nice work! Whoa! Wait a minute.

14:47.639 --> 14:49.973
I think I see more bad guys ahead.

14:50.008 --> 14:51.474
- Uh-oh.
- What?

14:51.509 --> 14:52.976
There's a giant.

14:53.011 --> 14:54.645
And does he...

14:54.679 --> 14:57.047
Yeah. He does. He's got a gun.

14:57.081 --> 14:59.081
No! Get down! He's gonna shoot it!

14:59.116 --> 15:00.450
You think?

15:00.484 --> 15:02.885
He did last time.
He said, "I'm gonna shoot."

15:02.919 --> 15:04.887
Then he did.

15:04.921 --> 15:07.157
- Last time, like in your story?
- Yes.

15:07.191 --> 15:08.758
He shot his gun... bing, bing!

15:08.792 --> 15:11.127
And then the other guy was bleeding.

15:12.268 --> 15:13.795
Only...

15:13.815 --> 15:15.698
it wasn't a story, was it, Jack?

15:15.732 --> 15:17.366
It really happened.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.601
I was scared. I closed my eyes

15:19.636 --> 15:21.403
until the giant disappeared.

15:21.437 --> 15:23.873
Hey, man, you are very brave.

15:23.907 --> 15:25.752
That's not what my brother said.

15:26.162 --> 15:27.476
Your brother was there?

15:27.510 --> 15:31.080
He said, "don't be a chicken.
It's just a stupid movie."

15:32.017 --> 15:34.283
Then he changed the channel.

15:34.317 --> 15:36.718
- The giant was on TV?
- Yeah.

15:36.752 --> 15:38.554
Mm.

15:40.657 --> 15:44.259
Mr. Castle wet his pants!
Mr. Castle wet his pants!

15:44.294 --> 15:46.094
Oh!

15:46.128 --> 15:47.696
No, no... see, the ground was wet!

15:58.273 --> 16:01.976
Yeah. Anton and Mr. Jaffe.
They come in here a lot.

16:02.011 --> 16:04.712
Anton rented a P.O. box
here about six months ago,

16:04.746 --> 16:06.480
Box 552.

16:06.515 --> 16:08.349
And he shared it with Jaffe.

16:08.383 --> 16:10.718
- They were sharing a P.O. box?
- Yeah.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.587
What kind of mail were they getting?

16:12.621 --> 16:14.455
That's the thing.
They weren't getting any mail.

16:14.489 --> 16:15.989
At least not that I ever saw.

16:16.024 --> 16:17.991
Then why did they need the box?

16:18.026 --> 16:20.595
All I know is they both came
in twice a week to check it.

16:20.629 --> 16:22.096
- Together?
- No.

16:22.130 --> 16:23.931
Usually about an hour apart.

16:23.965 --> 16:25.532
They were using it as a dead drop.

16:25.566 --> 16:26.834
Yeah, but for what?

16:26.868 --> 16:28.602
Uh... when was the last time you saw them?

16:28.636 --> 16:30.816
I saw 'em both last week.

16:30.836 --> 16:32.840
But Anton came in yesterday.

16:32.874 --> 16:34.775
And he seemed a little worked up

16:34.809 --> 16:36.944
after I told him about
the phone call I'd got.

16:36.978 --> 16:39.679
- What phone call?
- Some dude with a Russian accent

16:39.714 --> 16:42.682
called asking me who owned box 552...

16:42.717 --> 16:44.651
Anton's box.

16:44.685 --> 16:47.354
I told the caller we don't give
out that kind of information,

16:47.388 --> 16:49.922
but when I mentioned the call to Anton,

16:49.957 --> 16:51.358
he flipped out.

16:51.392 --> 16:52.959
So Anton knew this guy.

16:52.993 --> 16:56.095
Yeah. I guess so,
'cause he went into total panic mode,

16:56.130 --> 16:57.429
said he had to use the phone.

16:57.464 --> 16:58.765
But I couldn't let him use it.

16:58.799 --> 17:00.266
It's against company policy,

17:00.300 --> 17:02.034
so he just raced out of here.

17:02.069 --> 17:03.302
What time was that?

17:03.336 --> 17:04.837
- 3:00.
- Okay, thanks.

17:04.872 --> 17:08.174
3:00 p.m.?
That's two hours before Anton was killed.

17:08.208 --> 17:10.143
Sounds like this Russian
dude was coming for him.

17:10.176 --> 17:12.210
Who do you think Anton was
trying to call... Jaffe?

17:12.244 --> 17:13.811
Or someone else connected to all of this.

17:13.846 --> 17:16.147
Look, Anton didn't have a cell,

17:16.182 --> 17:18.215
so if he really needed to make a call,
he'd go nearby.

17:18.251 --> 17:19.585
I'll canvass all the stores in the area,

17:19.618 --> 17:21.051
see if anyone let Anton use their phone.

17:21.087 --> 17:23.121
Great. And, uh, school's almost out.

17:23.156 --> 17:24.522
I'll get ahold of Castle
and see if he's gotten

17:24.557 --> 17:26.124
any closer to finding our witness.

17:27.292 --> 17:29.027
Uh, no, no breakthroughs yet,

17:29.061 --> 17:30.862
but, uh, the good news is... is, um,

17:30.897 --> 17:32.697
it looks like they've accepted
me as one of their own.

17:32.731 --> 17:34.365
Okay, guys, give me the wallet.
That was a gift.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.834
Oh!

17:35.868 --> 17:37.244
Wait, what is going on over there?

17:37.245 --> 17:38.436
Is there a problem?

17:38.471 --> 17:41.139
No, everything's fine.
I'll talk to you tonight.

17:41.173 --> 17:42.708
Okay, bye-bye.

17:42.742 --> 17:44.342
Okay, guys, very funny.

17:44.376 --> 17:45.676
Give me back the wallet now.

17:45.711 --> 17:48.146
Mrs. Ruiz, a little help here?

17:48.180 --> 17:50.615
- Here! Here! Here!
- No? Huh?

17:52.651 --> 17:55.120
Okay, that's get... okay.

17:55.154 --> 17:56.854
Whoa! Whoa!

18:00.993 --> 18:03.360
Children,
line up in the hall for dismissal.

18:08.100 --> 18:11.135
Mr. Castle, are you okay?

18:11.169 --> 18:12.870
Oh, yes, I am.

18:12.904 --> 18:14.739
I'm fine. Thank you, Emily. Very kind.

18:14.773 --> 18:16.640
I know how it feels.

18:16.674 --> 18:18.742
Sometimes bad things happen to me, too.

18:18.776 --> 18:20.344
They do?

18:20.378 --> 18:22.479
Mm-hmm. Really bad things...

18:22.514 --> 18:25.815
Things I didn't want to tell Mrs. Ruiz

18:25.850 --> 18:27.784
when she asked me this morning.

18:27.818 --> 18:30.088
Well, things like what?

18:30.821 --> 18:32.156
Like yesterday, I was...

18:32.190 --> 18:33.556
Emily? Come along, dear.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.313
We don't want to be late for the doctor.

18:37.828 --> 18:39.677
Will you be here tomorrow?

18:39.697 --> 18:41.631
You can count on it.

18:48.915 --> 18:50.942
So Esposito confirmed with Emily's parents

18:50.962 --> 18:53.374
that her 14-year-old
brother was supposed to be

18:53.394 --> 18:56.552
watching her that day,
but he was playing videogames

18:56.572 --> 18:58.489
and he didn't check on her for hours.

18:58.523 --> 18:59.823
So she could have sneaked out.

18:59.857 --> 19:01.825
It is her, Beckett. I knew it!

19:01.859 --> 19:03.459
Which is why we should have talked to her

19:03.494 --> 19:05.228
at her place last night.

19:05.262 --> 19:07.196
And risk intimidating her? No, no.

19:07.231 --> 19:09.499
This girl's...
she's ready to open up to me.

19:09.533 --> 19:12.335
We have a... a special connection.

19:12.355 --> 19:15.238
Really? Should I be worried?

19:15.272 --> 19:16.740
Only that I'm gonna solve
the case before you.

19:16.774 --> 19:18.907
Oh.

19:19.830 --> 19:21.377
Where do you think you're going?

19:21.766 --> 19:23.579
Um, second grade.

19:23.614 --> 19:25.248
Not without finishing your breakfast.

19:25.282 --> 19:26.949
I ate most of it, and I'm just... I'm late.

19:26.983 --> 19:28.184
Come on, dad, just one more bite.

19:28.218 --> 19:30.553
Alexis, I'm not...

19:30.587 --> 19:32.688
Now don't forget your lunch.

19:35.125 --> 19:36.825
Okay. You're right.

19:36.860 --> 19:38.326
It's weird. I'll talk to her.

19:38.361 --> 19:41.130
- Okay.
- But right now...

19:41.164 --> 19:43.164
I'm late for a tea party.

19:45.735 --> 19:47.402
Thank you so mu...

19:47.436 --> 19:48.470
Oh, that's plenty.

19:48.504 --> 19:50.072
Did you make this tea yourself?

19:50.106 --> 19:51.939
- Mm-hmm.
- I have to say, it's excellent.

19:51.974 --> 19:54.409
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.044
Do you want some sugar?

19:56.078 --> 19:57.546
Actually, I'm trying to cut back.

19:57.580 --> 20:00.114
Do you have any low-calorie fairy dust?

20:00.149 --> 20:01.839
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.178
Perfect.

20:07.990 --> 20:10.391
Mmm! Delicious. Thank you very much.

20:10.425 --> 20:12.293
And thank you for spending recess with me.

20:12.327 --> 20:13.761
You're welcome.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.396
Do you want to build an ice palace?

20:15.430 --> 20:17.863
It's only my favorite thing to do.

20:18.273 --> 20:19.992
Here we go.

20:20.012 --> 20:21.803
Oh, they are nice.

20:21.837 --> 20:24.905
You know, Emily, do you remember yesterday

20:24.939 --> 20:27.675
you said that something
really bad happened,

20:27.709 --> 20:28.775
something...

20:28.810 --> 20:30.177
You're making the wall too high.

20:30.212 --> 20:32.079
Oh. Sorry.

20:32.113 --> 20:33.914
Ah! Is that better?

20:33.948 --> 20:35.583
All right.

20:35.617 --> 20:36.883
You said it was something

20:36.918 --> 20:39.052
that you didn't want to
tell Mrs. Ruiz about.

20:39.087 --> 20:41.533
Do you think maybe you'd want to tell me?

20:43.047 --> 20:44.457
Okay.

20:44.491 --> 20:46.459
You know, you could... if you wanted.

20:46.493 --> 20:49.495
It would just be...
One princess to another.

20:49.910 --> 20:52.787
Because princesses help each other?

20:52.924 --> 20:55.769
Because princesses help each other.

20:56.771 --> 20:58.744
It's about Jason.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.041
Jason... that kid who makes faces, Jason?

21:02.075 --> 21:03.843
He's a bully.

21:03.877 --> 21:06.579
He says mean things and pulls my hair.

21:06.614 --> 21:09.616
This morning, he stepped on my foot...
on purpose.

21:10.984 --> 21:13.402
Emily,
do you know why people do mean things?

21:13.987 --> 21:15.888
'Cause it makes 'em feel strong.

21:15.922 --> 21:18.590
Really, though, you and me,
we're the strong ones.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.826
We just keep our strength inside.

21:20.861 --> 21:22.661
So sometimes we forget it's there.

21:22.695 --> 21:25.164
Like sometimes I forget
I have gum in my pocket.

21:25.198 --> 21:30.002
Exactly.
So, next time Jason does something mean,

21:30.036 --> 21:34.505
you just use that strength
and just let it go.

21:34.539 --> 21:36.880
When he sees he can't upset you,
he'll stop bothering you.

21:36.900 --> 21:39.109
Okay?

21:41.144 --> 21:42.813
Can I go out and play now?

21:42.847 --> 21:44.081
Of course. I'll take care of these dishes

21:44.115 --> 21:46.016
and finish the palace.

21:51.063 --> 21:52.455
Not her, huh?

21:52.490 --> 21:55.592
Go ahead. Gloat.

21:55.626 --> 21:58.015
Maybe this was a dumb idea.

21:58.035 --> 22:00.330
Oh, it was.

22:00.364 --> 22:03.533
But... that dumb idea

22:03.567 --> 22:06.323
got Emily to confide in you.

22:06.795 --> 22:09.339
You're earning their trust, Mr. Castle.

22:09.649 --> 22:11.675
I guess I am, aren't I?

22:11.709 --> 22:13.777
And if you got Emily to open up to you,

22:13.811 --> 22:15.044
then who knows?

22:15.078 --> 22:17.814
Maybe that witness
really will come forward.

22:19.216 --> 22:20.483
Thank you...

22:20.518 --> 22:22.433
Leslie?

22:22.607 --> 22:24.386
- Still Mrs. Ruiz.
- Right.

22:24.421 --> 22:26.588
Oh, dear!

22:28.058 --> 22:29.192
Please!

22:31.461 --> 22:33.229
She punched me in the nose!

22:33.696 --> 22:35.531
It was my inside strength.

22:35.565 --> 22:38.117
I let it go, like Mr. Castle said.

22:38.137 --> 22:40.736
- You told her to hit me?!
- What?! No, Jason...

22:40.770 --> 22:42.204
I'm gonna tell the principal!

22:42.238 --> 22:44.239
I'm... that was...

22:47.677 --> 22:50.446
Mr. Castle, I'm sure that this is being

22:50.480 --> 22:53.382
blown out of proportion,
but I'll be candid.

22:53.416 --> 22:56.184
Jason's parents are two
high-powered lawyers

22:56.219 --> 22:57.886
with a zest for litigation.

22:57.920 --> 23:02.090
We found out a while ago that
it's best not to upset them.

23:02.124 --> 23:03.859
So what are you saying?

23:03.893 --> 23:05.994
We gave this experiment a fair shot,

23:06.028 --> 23:07.795
but now we have to move on.

23:07.830 --> 23:11.599
Principal Silva, please...
I just need a little more time.

23:11.633 --> 23:13.701
I wish that I could believe that,
Mr. Castle,

23:13.736 --> 23:15.570
but have you made any
progress in identifying

23:15.604 --> 23:18.172
this supposed witness?

23:18.206 --> 23:19.574
Any progress at all?

23:23.979 --> 23:26.180
Nothing pops with this financials.

23:26.214 --> 23:28.115
If Anton and Jaffe were
doing anything illegal

23:28.149 --> 23:29.917
with that P.O. box,
they weren't making much money.

23:29.951 --> 23:31.551
Clark Jaffe put in 30 years.

23:31.586 --> 23:34.855
He retired with commendations
and a spotless service record.

23:34.890 --> 23:37.124
Why would someone like him break the law?

23:37.158 --> 23:39.360
I'm asking the same thing about Anton.

23:39.394 --> 23:41.695
What we really need is Castle's witness.

23:41.729 --> 23:43.430
Yo. Canvass got a hit.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.399
The owner of a bodega
near that mailbox store

23:45.433 --> 23:47.601
said that Anton came in all
desperate to use the phone.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.504
- The guy let him make a call.
- To who?

23:50.538 --> 23:53.172
To this guy. Dimitri Kalenkov.

23:53.207 --> 23:54.674
He emigrated to the U.S. in '03

23:54.709 --> 23:56.610
and is rumored to be an
enforcer for the Bratva.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.211
Russian organized crime?

23:58.245 --> 23:59.979
Wait a minute.

24:00.014 --> 24:01.448
The guy who called asking
about the P.O. box...

24:01.482 --> 24:03.616
wasn't he Russian, too?
What if that was Dimitri,

24:03.650 --> 24:06.119
and he's the one that
took out Jaffe and Anton?

24:06.153 --> 24:08.421
Maybe they were involved
in something illegal,

24:08.455 --> 24:10.790
and whatever it was stepped
on Russian mob turf.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.658
So Anton called Dimitri
to smooth things over.

24:12.692 --> 24:15.161
And ended up taking two in the chest.

24:15.195 --> 24:17.363
Thanks, l.T.

24:17.398 --> 24:20.155
Organized crime just got a
current address on Dimitri.

24:22.135 --> 24:24.002
- N.Y.P.D.!
- Dimitri Kalenkov!

24:24.037 --> 24:26.806
- N.Y.P.D.!
- Hands up! Hands up!

24:26.840 --> 24:28.607
- N.Y.P.D.!
- Hands up, Dimi...

24:28.642 --> 24:30.810
That smells good.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.113
Found him!

24:35.148 --> 24:37.049
It's Dimitri.

24:39.852 --> 24:41.153
He's been shot.

24:41.187 --> 24:43.422
Been dead at least a couple of days.

24:43.456 --> 24:45.958
Hey, Beckett, check it out.

24:48.227 --> 24:51.729
Electrical cable, car battery, leads.

24:51.764 --> 24:53.832
He was tortured first.

25:03.654 --> 25:05.721
Well,
someone might have been tortured here,

25:05.755 --> 25:07.657
but it wasn't Dimitri.

25:07.691 --> 25:09.124
Are you sure?

25:09.159 --> 25:11.760
The only injury I see besides bullet wounds

25:11.795 --> 25:13.729
is a blunt-force trauma
to the back of the head,

25:13.763 --> 25:15.564
and by the look of the contusion,

25:15.598 --> 25:19.534
I would say it was made
by that broken chair arm.

25:19.569 --> 25:21.003
So if Dimitri wasn't tortured,

25:21.037 --> 25:22.437
maybe he was the one doing the torturing.

25:22.471 --> 25:24.239
It fits the profile of a mob enforcer.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.408
Which means whoever was
tied into that chair

25:26.442 --> 25:29.538
broke free, overpowered Dimitri,
and then shot him.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.214
How long has he been dead?

25:32.248 --> 25:33.648
I'd say at least three days.

25:35.284 --> 25:36.951
So Dimitri was killed
before Jaffe and Anton.

25:36.985 --> 25:39.153
And most likely by the same shooter.

25:39.188 --> 25:41.122
Same two taps to the chest.

25:41.156 --> 25:43.225
Okay, thanks.

25:44.327 --> 25:46.561
Why kill a mob enforcer, an ice cream man,

25:46.596 --> 25:47.695
and a retired cop?

25:47.730 --> 25:49.296
- What were they mixed up in?
- I don't know,

25:49.331 --> 25:50.865
but it's starting to look
like a russian thing.

25:50.899 --> 25:53.334
Anton, Dimitri,
the guy who called the mailbox store.

25:53.368 --> 25:55.036
Okay,
touch base with organized crime again.

25:55.070 --> 25:57.364
Let's see if there's a conflict in
the Russian community.

25:57.384 --> 25:58.784
All right.

25:58.804 --> 26:01.442
Hey. That was Anton's parents.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.444
Someone just broke into their
apartment and tossed the place.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.579
Just like Jaffe's place was tossed.

26:05.614 --> 26:07.314
The killer's after something.

26:07.349 --> 26:10.048
Something that our victims had.

26:10.068 --> 26:11.485
Yeah, but what?

26:11.519 --> 26:13.687
- Bye, Mr. Castle!
- Goodbye. Bye, sweetheart.

26:13.722 --> 26:15.689
Bye, Fiona. Bye, June.

26:15.724 --> 26:17.157
- Bye, Sophie.
- Thank you, Mr. Castle.

26:17.191 --> 26:18.925
- Bye, Sarah, bye.
- Bye.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.260
Have a good one, buddy.

26:20.294 --> 26:21.527
Jack, you make sure you keep your guard up

26:21.562 --> 26:23.063
on that battlefield, all right?

26:23.097 --> 26:25.665
- All right. Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.

26:27.668 --> 26:29.002
You're leaving?

26:29.036 --> 26:30.837
Oh. Yeah, Emily, I gotta go.

26:30.872 --> 26:33.140
Is it because I got you in trouble?

26:33.174 --> 26:35.441
Oh, no. No, Emily, that's not your fault.

26:35.476 --> 26:37.343
I-I'm always in trouble.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.679
Come here.

26:40.428 --> 26:43.849
You make sure you use your princess powers
for good, okay?

26:44.594 --> 26:45.922
Bye.

26:50.357 --> 26:51.624
Bye, guys.

26:52.660 --> 26:54.359
I never thought I'd say this,

26:54.394 --> 26:56.195
but I'm sorry to see you leave.

26:56.229 --> 26:58.197
Thank you very much, Mrs. Ruiz.

26:58.231 --> 27:00.398
Please call me "Leslie."

27:00.721 --> 27:02.868
I'll contact you if there
are any new developments.

27:02.903 --> 27:04.853
- I appreciate that.
- Take care.

27:17.610 --> 27:19.750
I could not believe what I saw.

27:19.785 --> 27:21.885
When my wife and I got back from lunch,

27:21.920 --> 27:24.922
the door was kicked in and
the place was torn apart.

27:24.956 --> 27:27.110
Do you have any idea what
they were looking for?

27:27.130 --> 27:29.660
In Anton's room, the ceiling vent

27:29.695 --> 27:31.862
was pried open, and on the floor

27:31.896 --> 27:33.496
right below it...

27:35.033 --> 27:36.700
I found this.

27:41.306 --> 27:42.572
Passports?

27:47.293 --> 27:48.945
They're blank.

27:48.979 --> 27:51.280
What was Anton doing with these?

27:51.315 --> 27:53.683
I've never seen them before today.

27:54.596 --> 27:56.185
What was my son involved in?

27:56.220 --> 27:57.554
He was studying graphic design.

27:57.588 --> 27:59.622
Do you think he was forging passports?

27:59.657 --> 28:01.691
Mr. Vetotchkin, I... I need to ask you...

28:01.726 --> 28:05.094
do you recognize this man?

28:05.128 --> 28:08.998
Yes, that's Dimitri. Dimitri Kalenkov.

28:10.234 --> 28:11.533
And how do you know him?

28:11.568 --> 28:13.702
He and my son grew up together

28:13.737 --> 28:17.306
back in Abkhazia during the war.

28:18.071 --> 28:20.276
Is Dimitri involved in this, too?

28:23.279 --> 28:25.547
I'm sorry. Just one moment.

28:28.682 --> 28:29.518
Hey.

28:29.552 --> 28:31.487
Beckett,
you need to come down here.

28:31.521 --> 28:33.224
I found something.

28:35.124 --> 28:37.125
Castle, whoever put this in your pocket...

28:37.159 --> 28:39.427
is sending me a message.

28:39.461 --> 28:41.129
Our witness is reluctant to come forward,

28:41.163 --> 28:43.064
but when they saw I was leaving,

28:43.099 --> 28:45.066
it forced their hand.

28:45.101 --> 28:47.735
Have you tried just asking who drew it?

28:47.770 --> 28:49.905
I don't want to scare them off...

28:50.257 --> 28:52.307
But I have a plan.

28:55.176 --> 28:58.178
Okay, class,
time for that extra recess period

28:58.213 --> 29:01.015
I promised you for being extra good today.

29:07.523 --> 29:09.490
I'm Emily. Who are you?

29:09.525 --> 29:12.927
I'm Kate. I'm Mr. Castle's... friend.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.821
Do you like to play princess with him?

29:16.733 --> 29:18.799
Uh... Sometimes.

29:20.965 --> 29:23.459
Are you two getting married?

29:24.539 --> 29:26.314
- One day.
- One day.

29:29.078 --> 29:31.611
Now's our chance. I'll take the front.
You guys take the back.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.179
Okay, so what are we looking for?

29:33.213 --> 29:34.815
A drawing that looks
like it could have been

29:34.849 --> 29:36.550
- made by the same kid.
- Yeah, but these are second-graders.

29:36.584 --> 29:38.452
I mean, don't their drawings look the same?

29:38.486 --> 29:39.719
Not to me, detective.

29:39.754 --> 29:41.688
When you live and breathe these children,

29:41.722 --> 29:43.523
every scribble is like a fingerprint.

29:43.558 --> 29:45.691
Can't imagine they'll need much
prompting when we confront them.

29:45.725 --> 29:47.160
This has clearly been eating away

29:47.194 --> 29:48.527
at their delicate little psyches.

29:48.562 --> 29:50.629
Given the chance to unburden themselves...

29:50.664 --> 29:51.931
found it.

29:53.533 --> 29:55.601
All right. Who's our sensitive little soul?

29:55.635 --> 29:58.071
Hey, Mrs. Ruiz,

29:58.105 --> 29:59.872
why are you going through my desk?

29:59.906 --> 30:01.941
Jason?

30:03.764 --> 30:05.551
You're the witness?

30:09.426 --> 30:12.573
I'm not talking to Mr. Castle.
He's a jerk-face.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.128
Okay, you know what?

30:14.162 --> 30:15.595
He's the jerk-face.

30:15.630 --> 30:16.964
He's 8 years old.

30:16.998 --> 30:18.598
You've been here for a day and a half,

30:18.633 --> 30:20.099
and you already have a Nemesis?

30:20.134 --> 30:22.903
How was I supposed to
know he'd be the witness?

30:30.812 --> 30:33.598
Jason, honey,

30:33.848 --> 30:36.349
I want you to know that
you're not in trouble, okay?

30:36.383 --> 30:37.550
Duh!

30:37.584 --> 30:40.586
All I did was draw a picture.

30:41.022 --> 30:42.922
Ex-exactly.

30:42.957 --> 30:46.122
But I know that you want to tell me

30:46.142 --> 30:47.927
all about this picture.

30:47.962 --> 30:49.662
Except jerk-face over there,

30:49.696 --> 30:51.197
he thinks that you're too
scared and that we should

30:51.231 --> 30:52.531
call your mom to come and pick you up.

30:52.566 --> 30:53.966
I'm not scared!

30:54.000 --> 30:55.935
Told ya.

30:55.969 --> 30:58.904
So, listen,
I need you to tell me everything

30:58.939 --> 31:00.372
that you remember seeing

31:00.406 --> 31:02.412
while you were hiding
in this ice cream truck.

31:03.009 --> 31:04.844
I-I can't.

31:05.279 --> 31:08.280
Jason, believe me,
it's gonna feel a lot better

31:08.314 --> 31:10.416
letting it out rather than keeping it in.

31:10.436 --> 31:13.818
No! I can't, because I wasn't there!

31:15.388 --> 31:16.855
You weren't?

31:18.358 --> 31:20.536
But I know who was.

31:21.653 --> 31:22.760
Who?

31:23.663 --> 31:25.530
I'm not supposed to tell.

31:25.564 --> 31:28.702
Jason, listen, we just want to help you.

31:28.925 --> 31:30.551
Okay?

31:37.376 --> 31:39.215
It was my sister.

31:40.445 --> 31:41.779
Okay.

31:41.814 --> 31:43.247
Does she go to this school, too?

31:43.281 --> 31:45.349
She's a grownup.

31:45.384 --> 31:47.451
We have different dads.

31:47.486 --> 31:50.221
I stay with her when our
mom goes out of town.

31:50.255 --> 31:53.657
So you gave her your
permission slip that day?

31:53.691 --> 31:55.192
She dropped me off

31:55.227 --> 31:57.694
and she said she had to meet her friend,
the ice cream man.

31:57.729 --> 32:01.698
When she came home, she was crying.

32:01.733 --> 32:03.934
She told me never tell
anyone where she went,

32:03.968 --> 32:05.769
or something bad would happen.

32:09.674 --> 32:12.509
What's your sister's name?

32:12.544 --> 32:14.778
Natalie Barnes!

32:15.946 --> 32:17.980
We're gonna need you to come with us.

32:18.015 --> 32:21.351
I was never in Anton's truck.

32:21.385 --> 32:23.811
I know that you were, Natalie.

32:24.407 --> 32:26.956
Listen, whatever you are scared of,

32:26.990 --> 32:28.458
I will protect you,

32:28.492 --> 32:30.126
but you have to tell me the truth.

32:30.161 --> 32:32.061
And you have to start with those passports

32:32.095 --> 32:34.470
that you helped Anton forge.

32:36.099 --> 32:38.067
So you were involved?

32:38.101 --> 32:40.536
We were just trying to do something good.

32:40.571 --> 32:42.337
Who do you mean by "we"?

32:42.372 --> 32:44.974
- You, Anton, and Jaffe?
- Yeah.

32:45.008 --> 32:46.709
Tell me about the passports.

32:46.743 --> 32:49.144
Anton's route

32:49.179 --> 32:52.114
covered Brighton Beach.

32:52.148 --> 32:53.848
There were a lot of Russians there,

32:53.883 --> 32:56.552
and he'd seen so many of them
come here with the promise

32:56.586 --> 32:59.020
of a job,
and then their papers would be taken,

32:59.055 --> 33:01.056
and they'd be forced to work in sweatshops

33:01.091 --> 33:02.891
or... or worse, and...

33:02.925 --> 33:05.961
Anton was trying to get back home.

33:05.995 --> 33:08.597
Which they couldn't do now
without the right documents.

33:08.631 --> 33:10.639
Yeah.

33:10.659 --> 33:13.468
And how did Jaffe fit into all of this?

33:13.502 --> 33:15.503
Well,
Anton heard that Jaffe had a connection

33:15.537 --> 33:17.305
that could get blank passports.

33:17.339 --> 33:19.507
And Jaffe worked Brighton Beach as a cop,

33:19.541 --> 33:21.109
so he knew what was going on,

33:21.143 --> 33:24.206
and...
and he was sympathetic to the immigrants.

33:24.226 --> 33:25.646
And you were the one

33:25.680 --> 33:27.215
with the high-tech design software.

33:27.249 --> 33:28.682
That's why Anton took your class.

33:28.717 --> 33:30.818
When I found out what Anton was doing,

33:30.852 --> 33:34.688
I-I decided to help, 'cause I...

33:34.723 --> 33:37.258
I wanted to make a difference.

33:43.375 --> 33:46.023
I don't understand how
this got anyone killed.

33:46.043 --> 33:49.301
The other night,
Anton was making a passport in class,

33:49.336 --> 33:52.038
and he saw the photo of the client,

33:52.072 --> 33:54.402
and he recognized the man. It was this...

33:54.422 --> 33:56.809
this terrible man from his past.

33:56.844 --> 33:58.210
Who?

33:58.245 --> 34:00.346
Anton called him "Polkovnik."

34:00.380 --> 34:02.448
Anton was terrified of him,

34:02.482 --> 34:05.317
said this Polkovnik once tried to kill him.

34:05.352 --> 34:07.319
But Anton said that he had to...

34:07.354 --> 34:10.088
to show the picture to a
friend of his just to be sure,

34:10.123 --> 34:12.491
some... guy called Dimitri.

34:14.362 --> 34:17.154
Natalie, what did you see in that van?

34:18.230 --> 34:19.965
Anton had left a message for me

34:19.998 --> 34:22.396
to meet him at his ice cream truck,

34:22.416 --> 34:24.431
away from his usual route.

34:24.451 --> 34:27.719
And when I got there,
he said that Jaffe was dead,

34:28.005 --> 34:29.440
and that this man had killed him,

34:29.475 --> 34:31.143
and that he was afraid
that we would be next

34:31.177 --> 34:32.811
if we didn't run.

34:32.844 --> 34:34.745
And then Anton saw him coming,

34:34.780 --> 34:37.735
so he told me to hide.

34:38.393 --> 34:40.185
And I watched.

34:40.219 --> 34:44.494
I watched as Polkovnik gunned Anton down.

34:45.090 --> 34:47.125
You see his face?

34:48.701 --> 34:50.895
Can you describe him?

34:50.929 --> 34:52.163
Yeah, I...

34:52.197 --> 34:53.664
I can do... better.

34:53.699 --> 34:56.333
Wait a second,
you're saying

34:56.367 --> 34:57.434
she's got a picture of Polkovnik?

34:57.468 --> 34:59.403
Yeah, in an envelope at her apartment,

34:59.437 --> 35:01.972
along with other information on him... why?

35:02.007 --> 35:03.874
Because we looked into this guy Polkovnik.

35:03.909 --> 35:05.375
Suffice to say he's wanted for a lot more

35:05.410 --> 35:07.077
- than just three murders.
- Here in New York?

35:07.111 --> 35:10.314
No, in the Abkhazia region
of Georgia 10 years ago.

35:10.348 --> 35:12.416
He's wanted by the world
court for war crimes.

35:12.450 --> 35:14.551
He was a militia leader,
committed atrocities,

35:14.586 --> 35:17.854
wiped out villages,
including where Anton and Dimitri lived.

35:17.888 --> 35:19.122
That's why they fled.

35:19.156 --> 35:20.624
Interpol's been after this guy ever since.

35:20.658 --> 35:22.792
They got a tip that
Polkovnik was in New York,

35:22.827 --> 35:24.127
so they're tightening the net.
Only one problem...

35:24.161 --> 35:25.361
there's no pictures of this guy,

35:25.395 --> 35:26.462
so no one knows what he looks like.

35:26.496 --> 35:27.931
And he wants to keep it that way,

35:27.965 --> 35:31.201
so when Dimitri tried to take
justice into his own hands,

35:31.235 --> 35:32.802
Polkovnik killed him.

35:32.837 --> 35:34.670
Then he tracked down Jaffe and Anton

35:34.705 --> 35:36.139
and killed them, too.

35:36.173 --> 35:37.607
He knew that they could i.d. him.

35:37.641 --> 35:39.142
That's what he was looking for...

35:39.176 --> 35:41.377
the picture that Anton was
gonna use on his passport.

35:41.411 --> 35:43.879
A passport that he desperately needs
to get out of this country.

35:43.913 --> 35:46.849
Okay, that photo is at Natalie's place.
Let's go.

35:51.939 --> 35:53.867
He's been here.

35:53.887 --> 35:56.256
Natalie said it was in the bedroom dresser,
bottom right drawer.

35:56.276 --> 35:57.559
Okay.

35:59.996 --> 36:02.364
It's not here. He must have found it.

36:02.398 --> 36:04.266
It's not in the drawer, Natalie.

36:04.300 --> 36:06.334
The photo was in an envelope.

36:06.369 --> 36:08.137
I hid it in an old camera case.

36:08.171 --> 36:10.239
Wait. Jason said he stayed here

36:10.273 --> 36:11.640
because his mom was out of town.

36:11.674 --> 36:12.840
So?

36:12.875 --> 36:14.576
Natalie, the... the camera case

36:14.610 --> 36:17.312
that you put the envelope in,
was it for a polaroid camera?

36:17.346 --> 36:18.913
How'd you know?

36:18.947 --> 36:20.948
Because Jason brought it to
Kennedy elementary yesterday

36:20.983 --> 36:22.950
for show-and-tell.

36:22.985 --> 36:25.186
That photo is in Mrs.
Ruiz's classroom right now.

36:25.220 --> 36:27.121
We get that photo, we'll get Polkovnik.

36:27.156 --> 36:28.923
Come on.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.775
The F.B.I.'S been notified.
They have agents on the way,

36:37.795 --> 36:39.910
and their tactical units
are sweeping the area

36:39.930 --> 36:41.297
around Natalie's apartment.

36:41.331 --> 36:43.132
Where are we on the a.P.B.?

36:43.166 --> 36:45.434
Ready to go. The feds want to
get this on the evening news.

36:45.468 --> 36:48.303
- All they need is that photo.
- You'll have it in five.

36:48.337 --> 36:49.738
Okay.

36:49.772 --> 36:51.139
Okay, which one's Jason's desk?

36:51.173 --> 36:52.507
Right here.

36:57.379 --> 36:59.218
Got it.

36:59.949 --> 37:01.950
Behind you.

37:09.524 --> 37:11.459
Aah! Aah!

37:12.995 --> 37:14.662
Aah!

37:33.540 --> 37:34.848
Get up.

37:35.625 --> 37:36.850
You okay?

37:36.884 --> 37:38.518
Yeah, I've taken worse.

37:38.552 --> 37:40.837
In this classroom, as a matter of fact.

37:43.196 --> 37:45.125
Cupcake stampede!

37:45.159 --> 37:46.393
Come and get 'em, guys.

37:46.427 --> 37:49.796
Here you go. One for everyone.
Help yourselves.

37:49.830 --> 37:51.631
This is just a little thank-you to say

37:51.665 --> 37:54.200
what a wonderful time
I had with all of you.

37:54.234 --> 37:56.769
- Thank you, Mr. Castle.
- There you go. You're welcome.

37:56.804 --> 37:58.037
Thank you, Mr. Castle.

37:58.071 --> 37:59.806
I'm gonna miss every one of you.

37:59.840 --> 38:01.307
Even me?

38:01.341 --> 38:04.043
Yes, Jason, even you.

38:04.077 --> 38:06.212
- What do you say? Truce?
- Yeah.

38:06.246 --> 38:07.901
- All right.
- Truce.

38:12.052 --> 38:14.020
Looks like your Nemesis isn't ready

38:14.054 --> 38:16.522
to call it a truce just yet.

38:16.556 --> 38:19.758
Yeah. Especially when he
sees what I put on his back.

38:24.708 --> 38:26.533
- Leslie, one for you?
- No, thanks.

38:26.553 --> 38:30.182
Actually,
we have something else for you as well.

38:30.739 --> 38:33.805
This is a medal of outstanding service

38:33.840 --> 38:36.274
from the N.Y.P.D. For your invaluable help

38:36.308 --> 38:38.292
with tracking down our witness.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.746
What's gonna happen to Jason's sister,
anyway?

38:41.780 --> 38:44.149
She's agreed to testify, and with her help,

38:44.183 --> 38:46.418
our three victims,
along with many, many other people

38:46.452 --> 38:48.486
will finally get justice.

38:48.521 --> 38:50.588
Then maybe you should
give this medal to her.

38:50.622 --> 38:52.323
I didn't do much to deserve it.

38:52.358 --> 38:53.591
Are you kidding?

38:53.625 --> 38:55.326
You put up with Castle for two whole days.

38:55.361 --> 38:57.710
I enjoyed the challenge.

38:57.730 --> 38:59.745
In my experience,
it's the most difficult children

38:59.765 --> 39:01.110
who prove most rewarding.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.505
Isn't that right, Mr. Castle?

39:03.802 --> 39:06.503
- Mr. Castle?
- No faces. That's right.

39:06.538 --> 39:09.239
Thank you.

39:09.274 --> 39:10.841
Oh!

39:10.876 --> 39:13.277
- See you later.
- Later, J.

39:13.311 --> 39:15.479
That's me.

39:18.316 --> 39:20.384
- What's wrong?
- It's Alexis texting me.

39:20.418 --> 39:23.387
"Be sure you come home right after school."

39:23.421 --> 39:26.748
How'd she even know I was here right now?

39:27.292 --> 39:30.159
She put one of those
tracker apps on my phone!

39:30.194 --> 39:34.094
Uh, Castle, uh,
this is getting a little out of hand.

39:34.114 --> 39:37.533
Yeah. I'm gonna have to deal with this.

39:37.568 --> 39:40.536
And I think I know how.

39:42.539 --> 39:45.779
Dad, what took you so long?
School ended hours ago!

39:45.799 --> 39:47.743
Alexis, sweetheart...

39:47.777 --> 39:50.571
I've been really worried.

39:50.591 --> 39:53.449
Yes, I know, and I think I know why.

39:53.897 --> 39:56.319
Because I disappeared.

39:57.309 --> 39:58.787
But... I'm back now,

39:58.822 --> 40:00.556
and I'm not going anywhere.

40:00.591 --> 40:03.140
I'm here to stay.

40:03.426 --> 40:05.160
I just keep thinking I'll lose you again,

40:05.194 --> 40:06.895
or something terrible will happen.

40:06.930 --> 40:08.430
I know it sounds crazy...

40:08.464 --> 40:10.833
No, no, it does not sound crazy.

40:10.867 --> 40:13.902
I would feel the same way.
Matter of fact, I did.

40:14.667 --> 40:16.459
- After Paris.
- After Paris.

40:16.479 --> 40:19.441
I couldn't let you out of my sight.

40:21.043 --> 40:22.459
But...

40:22.479 --> 40:25.980
I know that you consider yourself

40:26.015 --> 40:27.315
the adult of the family...

40:27.350 --> 40:28.617
For good reason.

40:28.651 --> 40:29.817
For very good reason.

40:29.852 --> 40:31.914
But...

40:33.322 --> 40:36.382
But part of being an adult is realizing

40:36.402 --> 40:40.427
you can't always protect
the people you love.

40:43.355 --> 40:44.496
Okay.

40:44.516 --> 40:46.034
Okay?

40:50.168 --> 40:53.274
- Being an adult really sucks.
- Yeah.

40:53.308 --> 40:55.817
And you've spent way too
much time having to be one.

40:55.837 --> 40:57.743
So...

41:03.791 --> 41:05.818
I'm ordering you to be a kid.

41:05.852 --> 41:07.320
Don't you think I'm a little old for that?

41:07.354 --> 41:08.821
I am not too old for it,
so you are definitely

41:08.855 --> 41:10.122
not too old for it.

41:10.157 --> 41:12.366
Don't you think we should
at least test them out?

41:12.912 --> 41:13.626
Okay.

41:13.661 --> 41:14.660
Okay.

41:17.330 --> 41:18.497
Where do you want to go?
