00:23.165 --> 00:25.288
Pardon me, ma'am, but why'd you stop?

00:25.380 --> 00:26.998
Who are you? What are you doing here?

00:27.065 --> 00:28.863
What am I doing her? What are you doing here?

00:29.011 --> 00:30.920
Where's Joe? What'd you do with Joe? 

00:31.012 --> 00:31.837
Who's Joe?

00:32.220 --> 00:33.993
Ouch. Wait a second.

00:36.181 --> 00:38.806
Hey, look at that. Is it yours?

00:40.353 --> 00:42.129
You think it belongs to somebody out there?

00:46.747 --> 00:47.873
Oh, my God.

00:49.184 --> 00:50.453
What am I going to do?

00:50.612 --> 00:51.701
What am I going to do?

00:51.970 --> 00:54.064
What are you going to do? What am I going to do?

00:54.203 --> 00:56.249
I got a strange gun in my coffin.

00:56.419 --> 00:58.744
I don't want to meet my maker with a strange gun in my coffin.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.884
- What about me?
- You I'd keep.

01:01.007 --> 01:03.388
It's this gun I'm having a problem with. 

01:06.555 --> 01:09.747
Look, I know we're in the middle of something here, but I have to get that.

01:09.843 --> 01:12.594
Hey, hon? Just stay where you are. I'll get it.

01:13.311 --> 01:14.642
Thanks, hon.

01:16.701 --> 01:17.714
Thanks, hon.

01:18.431 --> 01:19.357
Nice guy.

01:19.796 --> 01:21.046
Oh, which reminds me.

01:21.319 --> 01:23.832
There's something very important I have to tell you about him.

01:24.022 --> 01:25.850
Joe? You have to tell me something about Joe?

01:26.189 --> 01:27.774
As long as you're here.

01:28.534 --> 01:29.587
Australia.

01:30.140 --> 01:31.093
Excuse me?

01:31.896 --> 01:32.889
Australia.

01:33.278 --> 01:36.613
That's the message. That's what I have to say to you: "Australia".

01:36.959 --> 01:41.071
- "Australia"? The place...
- Just Australia.

01:42.192 --> 01:43.320
Australia.

01:43.867 --> 01:45.828
That's it.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.648
You can wake up now.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.439
I know I made a fuss, but don't worry about the gun. You can leave it here.

01:53.587 --> 01:57.009
It's okay. Roll over. My feelings won't be hurt.

02:00.647 --> 02:02.950
Yes, yes, absolutely. 9:30.

02:52.163 --> 02:56.459
Bagel for Marie, pancakes for Ariel, cereal for Bridgett.

02:56.526 --> 02:59.228
It's morning, we're cooking, we're happy.

02:59.792 --> 03:01.840
***, somebody do something about your sister.

03:02.853 --> 03:05.004
- She's hungry.
- We're all hungry.

03:06.171 --> 03:08.444
Bridgette, you want cereal. You can do that yourself, can't you?

03:08.521 --> 03:09.361
Okay.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.662
Daddy, these eggs are bad. There's a thingy on the yolk.

03:13.765 --> 03:14.870
Thingy? What kind of thingy?

03:15.085 --> 03:18.427
A thingy. A white dot on the yolk. Like the egg's almost hatched.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.905
You mean like there was an unborn chicken in the bowl?

03:22.648 --> 03:25.440
There's no unborn chicken in the bowl. There's no born chicken in the bowl.

03:25.504 --> 03:29.785
There's no chicken of any kind in the bowl. Perfectly natural for there to be a thingy on the eggs.

03:30.928 --> 03:34.024
Look, look, look. See? See what daddy made for you?

03:34.192 --> 03:38.826
- You just have to let it cool off a little bit.
- I'm sorry. I don't care what you say, these eggs are bad.

03:38.889 --> 03:41.090
Okay, fine. You win. They're bad. Get two more.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.962
There's nothing wrong with those eggs. Those are perfectly fine eggs.

03:44.060 --> 03:45.714
- Morning.
- I just got those eggs yesterday.

03:45.801 --> 03:48.899
- Ariel wanted pancakes.
- Not with the rotten eggs! Hello?

03:49.021 --> 03:50.430
Those eggs are fine.

03:51.525 --> 03:53.813
Why did you let me sleep in, why didn't you wake me?

03:53.931 --> 03:56.476
I don't know. You looked happy. You looked like you were having a nice dream.

03:56.593 --> 03:57.802
Were you having a nice dream?

03:58.331 --> 03:59.297
It was okay.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.197
Who were you talking to on the phone?

04:01.265 --> 04:02.957
Huh? Oh, nobody.

04:03.695 --> 04:08.344
Nobody? Joe, I saw you talking on the phone to nobody at 7:15 this morning.

04:08.411 --> 04:10.643
- It was Opsy.
- Honey, you're eating.

04:11.232 --> 04:15.282
It was a call from Dr. Katkoff's office. I have this thing this morning. It was just a reminder call.

04:15.559 --> 04:16.639
A thing? What thing?

04:16.740 --> 04:20.128
Don't you remember, Daddy? You were talking to somebody named Opsy.

04:20.209 --> 04:22.081
- Bridge!
- Don't you remember?

04:22.160 --> 04:24.903
- You said, "Bye, Opsy!"
- Opsy?

04:25.086 --> 04:26.356
Bye, Opsy.

04:26.707 --> 04:29.070
Bye, Opsy. Bye, Opsy. Bye, Opsy.

04:29.162 --> 04:31.215
Biopsy? You're having a biopsy?

04:32.143 --> 04:34.068
Why wouldn't you tell me something like this?

04:34.140 --> 04:37.057
I did. I did tell you. You knew I was going for a physical.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.532
Yeah, you told me you were fine.

04:38.642 --> 04:42.238
And I was fine. I am fine. Everything's fine. It's just a follow-up. It's nothing.

04:42.330 --> 04:45.069
It's a biopsy, Joe. "Biopsy" and "nothing" don't go together.

04:45.137 --> 04:48.520
People don't get a biopsy for the hell of it. You get a biopsy for a reason.

04:48.614 --> 04:51.413
And I don't understand why you wouldn't you tell me something like this.

04:51.516 --> 04:54.209
- Why? Take a look at yourself.
- Excuse me? What does that mean?

04:54.286 --> 04:57.978
It means I think that your reaction to this is completly out of scale with what is actually going on.

04:58.044 --> 05:00.395
- I think you're getting a little hysterical.
- Hysterical, really?

05:00.495 --> 05:04.582
My husband just told me he needs a biopsy and he's been keeping this information from me.

05:04.660 --> 05:06.164
How would you like me to react?

05:06.245 --> 05:09.601
You know what this is about? And I know you don't want to hear this, but with this new job of yours...

05:09.677 --> 05:10.838
- My job?
- One week you're busy... 

05:10.896 --> 05:12.985
- What has that got to do with keeping life altering events 
- And the next week you're sitting around here... 

05:13.041 --> 05:14.586
- ...waiting for the phone to ring 
- ...from me ?

05:14.673 --> 05:16.927
...and frankly, I was worried that if I told you I needed to have this little test done...

05:17.100 --> 05:19.006
-  "Little test"?
- ...when you had too much time on your hands,

05:19.072 --> 05:21.877
you'd sit around here and obsess about it and drive yourself crazy.

05:22.292 --> 05:26.603
- Boy, was I wrong.
- What, exactly, is this biopsy for?

05:26.664 --> 05:28.856
You know that little mole I have my back? The one I've had forever?

05:28.938 --> 05:30.899
- Katkoff just thought it was finally time.
- Lay down.

05:30.972 --> 05:33.107
- What?
- Lay down! I want to see it!

05:33.347 --> 05:35.574
See? This is exactly what I'm talking about.

05:35.718 --> 05:38.019
When you were in school, you were so busy studying doubtful process 

05:38.105 --> 05:41.888
I could have been sitting in front of the Tv dead for three days and you wouldn't have noticed.

05:41.979 --> 05:43.755
- Australia.
- What?

05:43.970 --> 05:45.143
Australia.

05:46.460 --> 05:49.563
It used to be round. Now it's shaped like Australia.

05:49.659 --> 05:52.404
- It itches. I scratched it. I shouldn't have.
- Don't.

05:52.973 --> 05:56.213
If I keep scratching it, I might get it look like the entire easten hemisphere.

05:56.494 --> 05:57.559
Can I get up now?

06:02.117 --> 06:02.909
What?

06:03.693 --> 06:04.574
Nothing.

06:05.973 --> 06:09.618
Listen to me. It's nothing, okay?

06:11.533 --> 06:12.403
All right.

06:12.540 --> 06:17.339
Nicholas Morgante is a father, is a husband, is a business man.

06:17.477 --> 06:21.573
He... he's a Little League coach. He's a lot of things.

06:21.679 --> 06:23.882
But the one thing he's not is a cop-killer.

06:23.944 --> 06:29.800
On the contrary, this man has enjoyed a friendly, long-standing relationship with the Phoenix Police Department

06:29.847 --> 06:32.918
and considered a lot of the men on the force to be close, personal friends.

06:32.986 --> 06:36.917
Mr. Watt, you said in a press conference yesterday that you were anticipating a speedy trial.

06:36.974 --> 06:40.190
- Why are you so confident?
- Well, for one thing. My client is innocent.

06:40.430 --> 06:44.276
For another, we know the late Detective was shot to death,

06:44.335 --> 06:47.223
but to date, I've yet to hear about the murder weapon.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.517
Has the District Attorney found the gun?

06:50.086 --> 06:51.480
It's not on my evidence list.

06:51.576 --> 06:55.861
Detective Pulaski was a highly valued and much-honored member of our police force.

06:56.395 --> 07:00.475
I personally had the pleasure of working with him many times over the past 15 years.

07:00.782 --> 07:04.622
For  the record, I'm especially committed to bringing his killer to justice.

07:05.210 --> 07:05.821
Thank you.

07:06.793 --> 07:10.454
Ladies and gentlemen, no testimonial evidence has been presented which can place

07:10.495 --> 07:14.935
the murder weapon in Nicholas Morgante's personal possession prior to the shooting.

07:15.375 --> 07:18.580
No physical evidence has been presented

07:18.646 --> 07:23.531
which can place the murder weapon in Nicholas Morgante's personal possession prior to the shooting.

07:23.633 --> 07:25.684
So what are we left with, ladies and gentlemen?

07:26.684 --> 07:31.575
In America, is it enough for the police or the District Attorney to say,

07:32.194 --> 07:33.493
"I just think he did it"?

07:34.128 --> 07:37.759
- I think I know where it is.
- You think you know where what is ? 

07:37.831 --> 07:40.284
The murder weapon. The gun.

07:41.610 --> 07:42.541
Counselor?

07:44.256 --> 07:45.956
Mr. District Attorney?

07:46.838 --> 07:49.137
- Welcome back.
- I'm terribly sorry, Your Honor.

07:49.207 --> 07:52.260
And is there something you'd like to share with the rest of the court, Counsel?

07:52.673 --> 07:55.926
Well, Your Honor, as a matter of fact, in the interest of justice, 

07:56.020 --> 07:59.181
the prosecution respectfully asks the court for a recess

07:59.248 --> 08:02.198
due to an introduction of new evidence brought to our attention.

08:02.284 --> 08:05.490
Evidence that has a substantial bearing on the outcome of this case.

08:08.736 --> 08:11.628
In the casket, burried with detective Pulaski's body.

08:12.099 --> 08:14.858
- And you're sure?
- Pretty sure. Yeah.

08:16.805 --> 08:23.051
Allison, I'm about to go ask for a court order to disturb this man's grave, exhume his body,

08:23.137 --> 08:27.464
open his casket and feel around, I'd like to go to the judge with a little more than pretty sure. 

08:27.582 --> 08:31.941
Well I don't know what to tell you, it is a dream. You have to allow for a certain margin of error.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.414
Kind of inspired, isn't it? Bury the murder weapon with the victim.

08:42.693 --> 08:43.958
"Rest on piece"?

08:48.964 --> 08:50.034
I'll get a warrant.

09:05.138 --> 09:06.690
It's so unfair.

09:10.243 --> 09:15.240
Those earrings, I could tell you where you got them, when you got them, why they mean so much to you.

09:15.327 --> 09:20.876
but when it comes to my own husband, my own children, or anything to do with my own life.

09:21.122 --> 09:24.144
- Everything's a blur.
- True for all of us, I'm afraid.

09:24.711 --> 09:28.031
- Kind of an elegant irony, isn't it?
- You think so?

09:28.241 --> 09:30.846
Hey, what we don't know can't hurt us.

09:34.232 --> 09:38.209
But then you didn't come here to philosophize, did you? You came here for answers.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.068
I'm worried about my husband.

09:40.856 --> 09:41.833
I know.

09:42.735 --> 09:44.322
Do I have a reason to be?

09:45.781 --> 09:48.592
You know, I normally hesitate doing this kind of thing.

09:48.936 --> 09:52.636
People have trouble understanding when you talk to them about their futures.

09:53.231 --> 09:55.894
The days of our lives are a lot like the weather.

09:56.456 --> 10:01.392
If you look long enough and hard enough, you can absolutely find a miserable day on the horizon.

10:01.919 --> 10:06.010
Conversely, if you're patient enough, there's always a sunny one coming, too.

10:07.623 --> 10:11.837
I think the key is to focus on something fairly narrow.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.892
Keep the questions specific.

10:14.678 --> 10:16.532
Well, this is very specific.

10:16.752 --> 10:19.666
- Because you know I can't lie.
- I'm not asking you to lie.

10:20.976 --> 10:22.159
All right, then.

10:25.006 --> 10:29.517
Uh... there's something medical going on, right?

10:31.351 --> 10:32.270
Yes.

10:33.761 --> 10:38.575
- It's... of no consequence 
- Oh my god, really?

10:38.676 --> 10:42.388
This biopsy business, it's nothing. You can put it right out of your mind. 

10:42.500 --> 10:46.352
- So he's healthy?
- Yes, he's healthy. He's extremely healthy.

10:46.434 --> 10:48.998
- You're sure?
- Yes. I'm sure. I'm absolutely sure.

10:49.127 --> 10:50.602
So everything's okay?

10:54.007 --> 10:56.982
- Catherine?
- Allison, I warned you.

10:57.145 --> 11:00.632
- "Everything" is a very big word.
- What do you mean?

11:01.600 --> 11:04.984
- Oh, my God. It's not one of my children?
- Don't do this to me.

11:05.450 --> 11:07.288
No, it's not the children.

11:08.522 --> 11:11.814
The... the subject was your husband.

11:11.926 --> 11:14.532
- But you said he was healthy.
- And he is.

11:15.121 --> 11:18.905
So who is it? Is somebody sick? You said you couldn't lie.

11:19.007 --> 11:20.743
No, nobody is sick.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.592
Then why are you looking that way?

11:26.386 --> 11:28.342
What is it you're not telling me?

11:30.117 --> 11:32.069
It's your marriage, dear.

11:32.621 --> 11:33.943
My marriage?

11:34.377 --> 11:36.012
What about my marriage?

11:40.086 --> 11:45.918
Oh... There's a... a darkness there.

11:46.158 --> 11:48.171
A very real darkness.

11:49.518 --> 11:51.475
A crisis of some kind.

11:52.508 --> 11:55.445
It's imminent and it's significant.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.870
I... I wish I could tell you more, but...

12:00.715 --> 12:02.021
that's all I see.

12:08.903 --> 12:13.469
Mom, I just felt Bridgette's toothbrush and it's completely dry. Completely.

12:13.592 --> 12:17.893
And then I checked that special toothpaste she made you buy her. And it hasn't even been opened.

12:17.949 --> 12:21.123
She's  lying, Mom. My toothbrush is soaking wet. You can check it.

12:21.293 --> 12:24.968
That's because she just wet it. That's because she just ran it under water.

12:25.031 --> 12:27.754
But she didn't actually brush her teeth with it.

12:27.836 --> 12:30.872
That tooth brush has never seen the inside of her mouth.

12:30.995 --> 12:34.170
Has, too, liar! It's seen it a lot.

12:34.441 --> 12:35.988
Mom, are you even listening?

12:36.996 --> 12:39.249
Mom? Mom...!

12:41.009 --> 12:43.580
If you're so worried about Dad, why don't you just call him?

12:43.658 --> 12:45.486
I'm  not worried about Dad. I'm fine.

12:45.992 --> 12:47.528
Did you brush your teeth?

12:48.588 --> 12:49.643
What?

12:50.205 --> 12:51.762
Okay, bedtime.

12:53.247 --> 12:57.511
Let's not worry. I'm sure Daddy just got tied up in traffic or his cell phone broke

12:57.604 --> 13:00.077
- or something came up...
- Hello, hello, hello...

13:00.180 --> 13:01.153
There he is.

13:02.001 --> 13:04.184
Well... hi.

13:04.511 --> 13:06.021
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:06.396 --> 13:07.133
Hi.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.194
Sorry.

13:10.753 --> 13:13.584
Two steps from the door and Starkey calls a meeting.

13:13.681 --> 13:15.422
- You didn't call.
- No. I know.

13:15.515 --> 13:19.058
There's no service in that wing for some reason. And you know, I tried to break away...

13:19.144 --> 13:22.277
And you couldn't. And you couldn't get your assistant to call?

13:27.136 --> 13:29.553
Girls. Come here, give me kiss good night.

13:40.776 --> 13:44.288
Remind me to call somebody tomorrow. There must be something wrong with that thermostat.

13:44.734 --> 13:46.604
It's really hot in this room.

13:46.987 --> 13:49.393
- I was worried, Joe.
- I said I was sorry.

13:49.487 --> 13:52.016
It's 9:00. How am I supposed to know you're okay?

13:52.092 --> 13:53.945
How do I know you're not lying dead somewhere?

13:54.031 --> 13:56.751
If something had happened, somebody would've called.

13:56.981 --> 13:59.714
If I were dead, who are we kidding, you'd be the first to know.

14:01.077 --> 14:03.163
Not funny. Come, eat.

14:03.940 --> 14:05.501
No, they already brought food in.

14:07.652 --> 14:09.905
So aren't you going to ask me how my biopsy went?

14:11.021 --> 14:12.628
How'd your biopsy go?

14:13.478 --> 14:14.395
Fine.

14:15.446 --> 14:19.346
So can I get an estimate on how long it's going to take for you to reach room temperature again?

14:19.386 --> 14:21.926
'Cause if there's time, I'd like to sneak in a shower here.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.781
A shower? You never shower at night.

14:25.914 --> 14:29.386
What can I tell you? I've been sitting with 20 people in a room built for ten.

14:29.555 --> 14:31.711
They shut off the air at 6:30.

14:32.002 --> 14:34.373
Does the shower not work after 9:00?

14:35.387 --> 14:37.895
- Fine. Go shower.
- Thank you.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.821
Hey. I'm sorry.

14:51.397 --> 14:53.917
Hey. You're forgiven.

14:54.177 --> 14:55.179
And, uh...

14:56.337 --> 14:57.776
I'm sorry I didn't call.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.002
- Wow. Your lips are room temperature.
- Really?

15:14.489 --> 15:16.096
What's the prognosis, Doc?

15:17.693 --> 15:19.220
What are you doing? Hey.

15:19.321 --> 15:22.286
Just relax. I want to be able to tell if it's growing.

15:22.717 --> 15:24.954
Very nice. This makes tremendous sense to me.

15:25.062 --> 15:28.097
I might not die from skin cancer, so you want to seal the deal with ink poisoning.

15:28.184 --> 15:31.477
Be still. This is a very delicate procedure.

15:33.902 --> 15:34.838
Done.

15:40.487 --> 15:44.660
If I knew I'd get this kind of reaction, I would've outlined all your moles.

15:47.728 --> 15:50.974
So tomorrow they exhume the body? They look for the gun?

15:52.409 --> 15:53.406
You nervous?

15:55.137 --> 15:57.498
Don't be. It'll be there.

15:57.635 --> 15:59.459
Why are we talking about this now?

15:59.587 --> 16:02.372
It's your work. I thought you found it interesting.

16:02.786 --> 16:04.919
I thought you wanted me to find it interesting.

16:09.505 --> 16:11.470
Well, don't go away mad.

16:11.664 --> 16:13.938
I don't know, Al, I think I'll take a rain check.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.913
You're putting out a weird energy tonight.

16:16.211 --> 16:18.731
You're  the one who came home from work three hours late.

16:18.822 --> 16:22.386
I said I was sorry. Isn't there a statute of limitations on this kind of thing?

16:29.451 --> 16:30.641
Are we okay?

16:32.165 --> 16:34.499
Of course we're okay. I'm just...

16:35.780 --> 16:38.229
We're both tired. We're both cranky. That's all.

17:00.684 --> 17:03.259
Mommy, you're dropping stuff.

17:03.357 --> 17:06.049
- This came out of Daddy's pants.
- Thank you.

17:09.723 --> 17:12.855
Mom? What are we waiting for? We're gonna be late.

17:14.790 --> 17:15.751
Mom?!

17:35.313 --> 17:36.111
Sir.

17:38.645 --> 17:41.362
Go over it for prints, then let's get it to ballistics.

17:56.068 --> 18:01.243
I'm nothing less than to stun by the Judge's decision to allow this gun as admissible evidence.

18:01.316 --> 18:04.996
And while I have the utmost respect for his honour, to ask this jury

18:05.079 --> 18:10.880
to believe that my client defiled the grave of a decorated police officer and a friend,

18:10.941 --> 18:15.159
and somehow managed to hide this weapon in a coffin that stood open

18:15.232 --> 18:18.688
and in full view of family and friends for two days...

18:19.762 --> 18:23.491
Well, I just can't understand why the District Attorney doesn't just do the honorable thing

18:23.567 --> 18:29.752
and go to the jury and admit, "We don't actually have a case, so we planted evidence."

18:30.860 --> 18:31.713
Excuse me.

18:34.707 --> 18:39.757
He's acting like he doesn't know what hit him, and I'm guessing that's because he doesn't.

18:39.839 --> 18:45.030
Now go home, and dream some more and tell me how long it takes me to win this case.

18:45.619 --> 18:47.754
- Allison Dubois?
- Yes?

18:47.988 --> 18:52.828
You're ordered to appear and give testimony in the matter of The State of Arizona v. Nicholas Morgante.

18:53.253 --> 18:56.484
It's called an "on-call" subpoena. Half the people in the office get them.

18:56.572 --> 18:59.012
There's a number at the bottom. You call before 7:00 every morning,

18:59.068 --> 19:00.851
and they'll let you know if you have to appear.

19:00.939 --> 19:04.650
If you want, I'll have the office call in for you, give you a few extra minutes of sleep in the morning.

19:04.742 --> 19:07.650
Oh, it's okay. I have kids. I'm up at the crack of dawn anyway.

19:07.743 --> 19:09.720
But why would they want me to testify?

19:09.820 --> 19:11.798
They don't. It's a nuisance tactic.

19:11.870 --> 19:15.422
The more you spend worrying about whether or not you're going to testify,

19:15.515 --> 19:18.166
the less time you have to prepare a case against their client.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.189
That's me. Bye.

19:25.136 --> 19:25.894
Hey.

19:26.129 --> 19:28.853
I just got your message. Congratulations.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.208
Yeah, it's been quite a day. How's yours going?

19:31.454 --> 19:34.653
Uh, not so good. Looks like we're going to be pulling an all-nighter here.

19:34.894 --> 19:36.262
An all-nighter?

19:36.370 --> 19:39.247
Well, not all night, but we're not going to get out of here until at least 9:00.

19:39.523 --> 19:44.136
Anyway, soon as I heard I made up my business to sneak out of the meeting I was in and call you.

19:44.218 --> 19:46.042
- Thanks.
- Listen, I gotta go.

19:46.384 --> 19:48.847
Kiss the kids for me. I'll try and call later.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.592
Okay. Bye.

20:56.952 --> 20:57.742
Hello?

20:59.459 --> 21:00.149
Hello?

21:01.490 --> 21:02.365
Hello?

21:36.439 --> 21:40.648
No. Great. I'll see you around 10:00. Okay, bye.

21:40.796 --> 21:45.378
I'm sorry about last night. What was it, like 11.30 when I stumbled in? 

21:45.627 --> 21:49.307
I think some of these guys actually just want to work late just to break some record or something. 

21:49.398 --> 21:52.170
It's like they don't have a life outside of that place. 

21:52.698 --> 21:53.770
So what are you doing today?

21:53.867 --> 21:57.859
Well, I'm not going to testify if that what you mean. Court's in recess.

21:57.969 --> 22:01.297
Devalos wants to talk to me about something. He's going to come by around 10:00.

22:02.259 --> 22:05.051
- I thought you hated that shirt?
- Huh?

22:05.152 --> 22:08.102
That shirt. The one you're wearing. I bought it for you.

22:08.198 --> 22:10.240
I liked it, and you hated it.

22:11.204 --> 22:14.583
- I never hated it.
- You never wore it. You said it was juvenile.

22:14.716 --> 22:17.625
So what happened? Your shirt suddenly matured?

22:17.758 --> 22:20.830
- You wanted me to wear another shirt?
- I'm just saying, I don't get it.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.727
You don't hate something for two years and suddenly you like it.

22:23.847 --> 22:26.503
I guess I finally get what you get. It's stylish.

22:26.601 --> 22:29.310
I like the shirt. Makes me feel good, has a nice cut.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.786
My wife bought it for me.

22:34.670 --> 22:36.917
I guess it doesn't seem juvenile to me anymore.

22:37.137 --> 22:38.120
I see.

22:39.777 --> 22:40.777
You taking the kids?

22:41.418 --> 22:42.103
Yeah.

22:43.307 --> 22:47.733
Got a call late last night. You're definitely testifying tomorrow when trial resumes.

22:47.836 --> 22:48.836
Oh.

22:50.029 --> 22:51.632
Okay. I guess.

22:51.734 --> 22:55.150
In fact, you're at the top of their witness list.

22:55.232 --> 22:59.417
Wait a second, I'm confused. The other day you said that serving me with a subpoena was no big deal,

22:59.514 --> 23:01.473
that they were just creating a new sense.

23:01.586 --> 23:03.443
Now I'm at the top of their list?

23:04.356 --> 23:07.980
- You know what probable cause is?
- Of course I know what probable cause is.

23:08.093 --> 23:10.284
Well, when you told me you thought you knew where the gun was,

23:10.356 --> 23:14.514
in order to exhume Pulaski's body, I needed a search warrant.

23:14.852 --> 23:15.815
Okay.

23:15.978 --> 23:19.982
And  in order to get that warrant, I had to show probable cause

23:20.084 --> 23:24.671
which is especially sensitive in this case. I mean, we were disturbing a dead man's grave.

23:24.789 --> 23:27.983
- Okay. So?
- So, unfortunately,

23:28.552 --> 23:32.858
there is no judge who will issue a warrant based on the dream of a... a...

23:32.935 --> 23:35.055
- A nut like me?
- Come on, Allison.

23:35.143 --> 23:37.696
Let's not make this any harder than it has to be.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.591
- It wasn't going to happen.
- So?

23:39.684 --> 23:42.387
- So did what was necessary.
- I don't know what that means.

23:42.474 --> 23:45.270
It means that sometimes you have to consider the greater good.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.103
I still don't know what that means.

23:48.408 --> 23:53.185
I requested the warrant based on information we received from an anonymous tip. 

23:53.278 --> 23:54.358
You lied.

23:54.572 --> 23:57.430
And I indicated you were the one who received the tip.

24:11.315 --> 24:15.770
So tomorrow, they're gonna want me to get up on the stand, put my hand on a Bible,

24:16.082 --> 24:19.046
and swear to the fact that I actually received this tip?

24:19.139 --> 24:20.699
At the very least.

24:22.032 --> 24:23.798
But here is my bigger fear.

24:25.574 --> 24:28.216
You're Morgante. You've killed a police detective.

24:28.313 --> 24:33.731
Now somehow, you've managed to slip the murder weapon into your victim's casket prior to his burial.

24:33.808 --> 24:38.057
What are the chances that you told somebody-- anybody-- about what you did and how you did it,

24:38.129 --> 24:40.981
knowing that one slip of the tongue could cost you your life.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.110
I think they know there was no tip.

24:44.697 --> 24:48.851
I think they might have heard about you. I think they may have heard about what you do.

24:48.947 --> 24:50.356
Well then I can tell the truth.

24:50.509 --> 24:55.358
Allison, you're not getting this. The warrant's dirty, I lied to get it.

24:55.441 --> 25:00.294
If you get on the stand and say anything other than what I told the judge in the first place,

25:00.375 --> 25:05.342
he tosses out the gun as evidence. Not to mention my credibility with the jury is nil.

25:05.459 --> 25:09.663
All of a sudden it's not so hard to believe we're capable of planting Morgante's fingerprints on the gun.

25:09.724 --> 25:13.175
Planting the gun on the body, planting everything.

25:13.426 --> 25:17.573
- That's it and you want me to lie.
- I want you to stick to the story.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.346
You work in my office. You're a consultant,

25:19.427 --> 25:23.462
and if he starts asking anything about dreams or psychic phenomenon... 

25:23.538 --> 25:25.147
- Oh my god.
- Just deny it, 

25:25.240 --> 25:27.999
The more matter-of-factly you deny it, the sillier and more desperate he sounds.

25:28.112 --> 25:29.535
I don't know if I can do this.

25:29.626 --> 25:33.318
Allison, I did a terrible thing to you, and I'm sorry, but here we are.

25:33.860 --> 25:36.579
This isn't easy for me, coming here, asking you for this

25:37.296 --> 25:42.456
I'm an attorney, I believe in the law, I believe in the truth but I know this son of a bitch killed a police officer.

25:42.575 --> 25:47.613
He killed a police officer and then made the man's final resting place his own private joke.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.746
If there ever was a reason to lie, I...

25:52.923 --> 25:53.992
I'm sorry.

25:55.934 --> 25:57.273
I need to think.

26:04.182 --> 26:05.953
- Joe Dubois. 
- Hi, it's me.

26:06.051 --> 26:06.849
Hey, Al.

26:06.958 --> 26:10.085
Look. Something's happened and I need you home at the regular time tonight.

26:10.182 --> 26:11.996
I really need you here.

26:12.235 --> 26:15.431
Babe, you gotta know, if I could be here I would, but I ?hardly smile?.

26:15.502 --> 26:16.839
No, you're not hearing me.

26:16.920 --> 26:22.122
You tell Kelly not tonight. You tell Kelly your wife needs you, home with her.

26:23.413 --> 26:25.767
Okay. Sure.

26:25.840 --> 26:26.653
Thank you.

26:34.211 --> 26:35.255
Good night, baby.

26:35.537 --> 26:36.505
Good night, Mommy.

26:39.503 --> 26:42.527
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Mommy.

26:49.382 --> 26:52.064
You know, you ask me to come home. You said it was important. 

26:52.157 --> 26:54.466
You haven't said a word to me since I got here.

26:54.657 --> 26:56.966
You want to clue me in on this crisis?

26:57.757 --> 27:00.278
Well, my boss stopped by the house today.

27:03.326 --> 27:05.913
Seems I've being called to testify tomorrow.

27:08.208 --> 27:10.396
And he wanted to know if it wouldn't be too much trouble if, 

27:10.508 --> 27:13.696
when I got on the stand, I wouldn't mind perjuring myself.

27:13.784 --> 27:15.443
And why would he want you to do that?

27:15.525 --> 27:19.555
Well, it seems you can't get a search warrant in Arizona based on a psychic's dream,

27:19.615 --> 27:24.480
so he told the court that I got an anonymous tip and he wants me to testify to that.

27:26.148 --> 27:30.343
Well, I know that's not what you want to hear, but it sounds like pretty good advice to me.

27:30.429 --> 27:33.997
Did you hear any of what I just said? They want me to lie in court.

27:34.074 --> 27:36.180
- Yeah, I heard you.
- I can't lie!

27:36.275 --> 27:39.469
I beg to differ, honey. Wasn't it just last week you told the cousins 

27:39.565 --> 27:41.469
they couldn't come visit 'cause we were getting the house painted?

27:41.570 --> 27:43.950
This is in court. This is under oath.

27:44.023 --> 27:47.954
I heard that part, but, really, what choice do you have?

27:48.037 --> 27:49.982
- You don't understand.
- Well I think I do.

27:50.049 --> 27:51.533
No, you don't, Joe.

27:51.815 --> 27:57.442
If I lie, I don't just betray myself, I betray whatever it is that makes it possible for me to see this stuff

27:57.509 --> 27:58.472
Really? You think so?

27:58.549 --> 28:01.307
You think if you get up there on the stand and testify, then that's it?

28:01.502 --> 28:03.905
No more scary dreams, no more hearing other people's thoughts, 

28:03.992 --> 28:06.675
no more dead people hanging around the house and killing the mood 

28:06.740 --> 28:08.230
'cause I gotta tell you Allison, if that's the case,

28:08.336 --> 28:10.877
it's all the more reason to get up there and lie.

28:10.976 --> 28:14.378
You know what, Joe? I made a mistake. I shouldn't have called you. Go back to work.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.263
- Don't push me, Al.
- What does that mean?

28:16.335 --> 28:20.457
It means, the way I'm feeling and the way you've been acting-- don't tempt me.

28:20.989 --> 28:24.815
- Whoa. Okay, so you're not a happy guy, huh?
- Not right now. Not about this.

28:24.881 --> 28:28.516
Wait, wait. Let's be clear about this. About what?

28:28.592 --> 28:31.936
This. This pathological need that you seem to have 

28:32.032 --> 28:35.996
to call the world's attention to the fact that you're... the way you are. 

28:36.058 --> 28:37.968
- The way I am?
- Oh, please.

28:38.050 --> 28:42.191
No! No! You know me, Joe. I am not a religious person.

28:42.264 --> 28:45.211
I'm not a Holy Roller, praise-the-Lord type,

28:45.285 --> 28:48.229
but whatever it is that allowed me to see that gun?

28:48.355 --> 28:50.199
It comes from a higher place,

28:50.343 --> 28:52.555
and I didn't want it and I didn't ask for it

28:52.626 --> 28:56.671
and sometimes I wish I never had it, but the fact is, I do have it.

28:56.737 --> 29:00.681
It is a part of me. And I'm proud of it, and to be put in this position...

29:00.762 --> 29:02.696
What position? I'm baffled.

29:02.984 --> 29:05.784
What is it that you actually want to do? You want to get up there and tell the truth?

29:05.889 --> 29:08.165
- Yeah. I do!
- Are you crazy?

29:08.263 --> 29:10.972
Are you really that self-deluded? Leave it alone.

29:11.108 --> 29:13.435
I can't believe you're even entertaining the notion of it;

29:13.522 --> 29:16.280
Have you tought it through? Have you thought even half way through?

29:16.342 --> 29:17.637
Let it ring!

29:18.011 --> 29:21.748
Can you imagine the front page of our local paper if you do this?

29:21.810 --> 29:24.416
Can you imagine the 6:00 news?

29:25.041 --> 29:29.265
Have you thought about the impact that's going to have on our girls, at school, in the playground?

29:29.334 --> 29:33.218
Have you thought about the impact that's gonna have on me, at my job, out in the world?

29:33.304 --> 29:37.842
This isn't about you. And whatever cosmic channel your getting your vibes from.

29:37.918 --> 29:41.777
This is about all of us. Is this something you really wanna do?

29:41.859 --> 29:43.027
I don't know!

29:45.198 --> 29:46.124
Hello!

29:47.497 --> 29:48.332
Yeah.

29:49.924 --> 29:51.153
Just a moment.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.734
It's for you. It's Kelly.

29:57.583 --> 29:58.532
Hello.

29:59.555 --> 30:01.855
No, it's a family thing.

30:02.786 --> 30:06.733
It's right there on the desktop on the file marked "Kelly."

30:08.206 --> 30:10.081
Okay, see you in the morning.

30:13.031 --> 30:17.147
- Kelly Charles is a man.
- Kelly Charles is an animal.

30:17.557 --> 30:20.992
Kelly Charles is the reason I've been sleepwalking for the last week.

30:21.121 --> 30:26.102
Davenport brought him in on the drone project to kick our asses and make some deadlines.

30:26.204 --> 30:28.525
- Him.
- Yes. Of course.

30:28.934 --> 30:30.081
Oh, my God.

30:30.909 --> 30:33.030
Kelly wasn't the crisis.

30:33.507 --> 30:36.471
Me, taking the stand, you wanting me to lie.

30:36.599 --> 30:38.535
This fight that we're having. This is the crisis.

30:38.616 --> 30:41.045
I have actually no idea what you're talking about. 

30:41.216 --> 30:43.475
And ?further? I have no idea what you've decided. 

30:43.556 --> 30:45.609
Well, 'cause I don't know what I've decided,

30:46.010 --> 30:50.070
except I'd really like you to be there. I mean, if Kelly would give you the time.

30:50.137 --> 30:54.878
'Cause I have to tell you, if I have to get up on the stand and perjure myself

30:54.965 --> 31:01.958
and lie to God and a judge, then I really want your ass sitting there in the front row when I do it.

31:05.829 --> 31:09.679
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

31:09.761 --> 31:10.642
I do.

31:17.812 --> 31:21.654
Mrs. Dubois, could you tell the court what you do for a living?

31:22.782 --> 31:26.402
I work for the District Attorney's office on a part-time basis here in Phoenix.

31:26.468 --> 31:30.436
And what do you do for the District Attorney's office? Do you have a... a job title?

31:30.528 --> 31:33.391
- I'm a freelance consultant.
- A freelance consultant?

31:33.487 --> 31:35.177
Can you be more specific?

31:35.407 --> 31:37.974
I studied case law and criminal law in college.

31:38.075 --> 31:42.022
- So you're a legal consultant?
- Yes. I suppose you could say that.

31:42.130 --> 31:45.043
And how long have youn at the D.A.'s office?

31:45.172 --> 31:48.392
Two months, although prior to that, I interned there.

31:48.484 --> 31:51.070
- And do you have a law degree?
- No, I do not.

31:51.172 --> 31:54.522
I see. Well, then, could you briefly walk us

31:54.572 --> 31:57.936
through what a typical workday would look like for you at the D.A.'s office?

31:58.054 --> 32:00.967
Objection, Your Honor. How in the world would an understanding

32:01.023 --> 32:04.136
of a typical workday for Mrs. Dubois contribute to this case?

32:04.249 --> 32:07.122
Your Honor, the name, Allison Dubois, appears on a search warrant

32:07.183 --> 32:11.160
used to obtain crucial evidence in the prosecution of my client.

32:11.248 --> 32:13.903
Now, given that fact, the court has a right to know specifically 

32:14.008 --> 32:16.123
what Mrs. Dubois's involvement in this case is,

32:16.229 --> 32:19.865
and what her function was within the office of the District Attorney.

32:21.268 --> 32:24.944
Overruled. You may answer the question, Mrs. Dubois.

32:25.521 --> 32:31.338
On a typical day, I might interview a witness or witnesses involved in a possible crime.

32:31.452 --> 32:34.611
I might be asked to take statements from such witnesses.

32:34.983 --> 32:38.769
On occasion, I've been asked to monitor interrogation of suspects.

32:38.974 --> 32:41.794
You do all that for the District Attorney without a law degree?

32:44.303 --> 32:45.215
Wow.

32:46.059 --> 32:50.549
- There must be something very special about you .
- My husband seems to think so.

32:54.169 --> 32:58.899
This is the warrant ordering the exhumation of detective Pulaski's body .

32:59.090 --> 33:02.990
Now, according to the information on line seven,

33:03.068 --> 33:07.783
it was granted on the basis of an anonymous tip which you allegedly received.

33:07.958 --> 33:09.898
- Am I correct?
- Yes.

33:10.671 --> 33:13.686
What is not indicated anywhere on this warrant

33:14.081 --> 33:17.363
is how you received this anonymous tip.

33:18.177 --> 33:20.824
Did it come in the form of a phone call from this person?

33:22.124 --> 33:24.639
- No, it did not.
- No phone call.

33:25.457 --> 33:29.902
So, this... this anonymous tipster, did you meet him face-to-face?

33:30.000 --> 33:33.748
Objection, Your Honor. Answering the question assumes a degree of specificity and,

33:33.830 --> 33:36.553
as a result, compromises the anonymity of our source.

33:37.397 --> 33:40.495
Overruled. Please answer the question.

33:41.509 --> 33:50.060
So once again, Mrs Dubois, are you testifying that you actually met this anonymous tipster face-to-face?

33:57.944 --> 33:59.040
Oh, yes.

33:59.521 --> 34:02.250
- You did?
- I certainly did.

34:02.946 --> 34:05.374
Now I am impressed.

34:05.952 --> 34:08.978
You say you've worked for the District Attorney's office for how long?

34:09.248 --> 34:11.286
- Two months.
- Two months.

34:12.859 --> 34:19.454
Not a very long time. But here you are, with an anonymous source seeking you out.

34:19.556 --> 34:23.965
Contacting you instead of the lead detective involved in this case.

34:24.025 --> 34:27.112
Contacting you instead of the District Attorney.

34:27.221 --> 34:31.344
Contacting you instead of the Assistant District Attorney or the Assistant-Assistant,

34:31.426 --> 34:36.533
or the dozens of other law inforcement individuals involved in this case.

34:36.719 --> 34:38.402
That's a hell of a story, Mrs. Dubois.

34:38.489 --> 34:42.976
Your Honor, is Counsel asking questions of the witness or offering a summation to the jury?

34:43.081 --> 34:46.799
- Mr Watt...
- My apologies your honor, it won't happen again.

34:47.813 --> 34:52.114
And with that in mind, I'm gonna ask you a simple direct question, Mrs. Dubois.

34:52.206 --> 34:54.822
And remember, you're under oath. You swore to tell the truth.

34:54.895 --> 34:56.963
- What is it you're not telling us?
- Excuse me?

34:57.051 --> 34:59.452
You're Honor, he's asking the witness to question herself!

34:59.548 --> 35:02.350
Mr. Watt, you'd better come to some kind of logical conclusion here.

35:02.427 --> 35:06.015
That's exactly what I'm trying to do, Your Honor. I'm trying to find the logic here.

35:06.082 --> 35:10.885
Now, the witness has testified that she's only worked for the district attorney's office for two months.

35:10.971 --> 35:13.854
That she has no law degree, no real authority.

35:13.935 --> 35:18.856
And yet, someone with vitally important information sought her out.

35:18.995 --> 35:22.922
It doesn't seem logical. It doesn't make any sense.

35:23.619 --> 35:26.403
- Unless...
- Unless what, Counsel?

35:26.501 --> 35:31.866
Unless the witness enjoyed a special and privileged relationship

35:31.948 --> 35:34.637
with the informant that she's not sharing with the Court.

35:34.744 --> 35:36.457
- Objection.
- Overruled.

35:36.578 --> 35:39.940
Isn't that really what the situation is here, Mrs. Dubois?

35:40.044 --> 35:46.919
Did you enjoy a "special and privileged" relationship with this tipster that you're not sharing with the court?

35:47.012 --> 35:49.657
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

35:49.822 --> 35:55.407
I think you know exactly what's so special about you that you were at that cemetery the other day.

35:55.479 --> 35:59.756
I think you know exactly what's so special about you that the District Attorney

35:59.817 --> 36:03.365
keeps you around despite the fact that you have no law degree.

36:03.463 --> 36:07.308
I think you know exactly what is so special about you

36:07.369 --> 36:13.322
that this anonymous tipster sought you out over and above everyone else involved with this case.

36:13.416 --> 36:16.549
And I think it goes to the very core of who you are

36:16.626 --> 36:20.337
and what you do for the District Attorney, doesn't it Mrs. Dubois. 

36:20.420 --> 36:22.136
Objection. What is the question?

36:22.223 --> 36:23.579
The question is...

36:24.300 --> 36:28.453
"What makes you so special, Mrs. Dubois?

36:29.308 --> 36:32.002
"What do you really do for the District Attorney?

36:32.119 --> 36:34.858
Who are you rea1ly, Mrs. Dubois?"

36:35.908 --> 36:38.996
Well, I'm not Adam Humphreys.

36:40.940 --> 36:42.569
What did she just say?

36:42.686 --> 36:46.690
- She said, "I'm not Adam Humphreys."
- Who the hell is Adam Humphreys?

36:47.202 --> 36:50.576
- What did you just say?
- Adam Humphreys. He took your bar exam for you.

36:50.656 --> 36:53.367
- I can't hear them. Can you hear them?
- After you cheated, but still failed three times.

36:53.448 --> 36:56.225
- Counselor, I need you to take your hand off the microphone.
- And I'm not Dean Gardner.

36:56.307 --> 36:59.137
You bribed him to keep quiet in your last murder trial.

36:59.250 --> 37:02.054
- And I'm not Shannon Leel.
- Objection, your honor, the defense is having

37:02.150 --> 37:03.054
a private conversation with the witness. 

37:03.126 --> 37:06.629
- 'Cause you're cheating on your wife with her.
- Mr. Watt, remove your hand from the microphone

37:06.694 --> 37:08.728
- and back away from the witness, please.
- So now you know.

37:08.795 --> 37:12.280
- Do you really want to keep asking me who I am...
- Mr. Watt...

37:12.333 --> 37:16.822
- ...at the risk of everyone finding out who you are?
- Don't make me get the bailiff to remove you.

37:18.589 --> 37:19.608
Bailiff?

37:20.001 --> 37:22.587
Assist Defense Counsel back to his seat, please.

37:24.073 --> 37:24.896
Sir.

37:25.900 --> 37:27.493
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

37:33.099 --> 37:37.538
Will the court reporter please read back the last question from Counsel?

37:38.491 --> 37:41.521
"The question is, 'What makes you so special, Mrs. Dubois?

37:41.608 --> 37:46.467
What do you really do for the District Attorney? Who are you really, Mrs. Dubois?'"

37:51.310 --> 37:55.294
I'm just a part-time consultant trying to do her job.

38:00.087 --> 38:01.868
No further questions, Your Honor.

38:04.372 --> 38:07.840
We reserve the right to recall this witness at another time.

38:17.640 --> 38:18.831
Thanks.

38:25.083 --> 38:26.080
Negative.

38:27.550 --> 38:28.836
The biopsy was negative.

38:32.963 --> 38:37.688
Boy, for someone who just dodged a major bullet, you seem a little down.

38:38.077 --> 38:41.046
What is it, it's all over now, you maybe a little disappointed?

38:41.343 --> 38:42.234
About what?

38:42.352 --> 38:45.450
I don't know, not being able to get up there and declare who you are, what you do?

38:46.694 --> 38:48.143
No, I don't think so.

38:48.865 --> 38:51.758
I fear that day is coming no matter what we do.

38:52.178 --> 38:54.026
It's a tough secret to keep.

38:56.429 --> 38:58.502
I'll call the baby-sitter just to check in.

39:00.304 --> 39:03.186
What is it? Something's still eating at you. I can feel it.

39:03.457 --> 39:05.624
It's nothing. It's probably nothing.

39:05.746 --> 39:09.360
You know me, every day is cloudy, every dream's a nightmare.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.122
I'm sure it's nothing.

39:15.438 --> 39:16.610
I need more wine.

39:17.007 --> 39:19.391
Hello? Can we get another glass here?

39:25.038 --> 39:26.355
Oh my god.

39:36.717 --> 39:38.496
- She's choking.
- Somebody!

39:56.152 --> 39:58.283
- You okay?
- Yeah.

39:59.183 --> 40:00.521
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:00.628 --> 40:01.954
Can't believe it actually works.

40:02.594 --> 40:03.756
Sit down, sit down.

40:04.296 --> 40:05.427
Glass water?

40:06.128 --> 40:07.991
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:17.579 --> 40:19.224
All in a day's work.

40:21.584 --> 40:22.782
What are you smiling at?

40:24.645 --> 40:27.093
The sun just came up, that's all.
