WEBVTT

00:03.120 --> 00:04.150
You a spy?

00:04.200 --> 00:07.070
One of those sleeper cells who's
going to kill us all one night?

00:07.120 --> 00:08.550
We had another break-in.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.470
- Did they leave another note?
- No.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.950
But I think it was just Ed's way
of saying "I'm thinking of you."

00:13.000 --> 00:16.870
The only mention of our
child in your little story

00:16.920 --> 00:19.310
was on a card, and it was misspelled.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.830
Three months ago, I got a bill
for the rescue for the balloon

00:22.880 --> 00:25.950
from the Australian and
New Zealand navies.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.390
1.2 million, Cleave.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.240
I need Cleaver!

00:32.759 --> 00:35.830
Barney, don't go, please! Please!
I beg you, please don't go!

00:35.880 --> 00:39.470
I need help. I need help. I need help.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.270
- Oh! Oh.
- Oh!

00:41.320 --> 00:42.550
Ah!

00:42.600 --> 00:44.790
Max! Max, it's OK.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.750
I don't know how to stop this.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.310
Fortunately, I do.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.390
Good morning, Mr. Greene.

00:58.440 --> 01:01.040
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.240 --> 01:52.150
You know, it used to be just
people interacting, you know.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.350
It was something real.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.200
You followed that. That was the conflict.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.190
Yeah, well I still fuckin' like 'em.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.750
Well, I've reached my threshold.
That's what I was saying.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.830
I mean, they were great when
they started, you know --

02:03.880 --> 02:05.190
they were a break from the convention,

02:05.240 --> 02:07.790
but now it's like there's
nothing but them.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.350
That's all I'm saying.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.390
Yeah, well, I still fuckin' like 'em.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.950
You don't wanna go to
war over this, Stig, OK?

02:14.000 --> 02:17.430
I'm just saying I think that reality
shows have had their day, yeah?

02:17.480 --> 02:20.070
I mean, I still watch the
occasional bit of Jamie Oliver.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.350
- Oh, yeah.
- I'll admit that, alright?

02:22.400 --> 02:24.230
But I need story.

02:24.280 --> 02:27.350
I need authentic narrative
that draws me in,

02:27.400 --> 02:29.630
that takes me to a place
I haven't been before

02:29.680 --> 02:31.750
and then gives me some
fuckin' meaning at the end.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.030
- Yeah.
- I agree.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.190
- You know what I'm saying?
- I agree.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.990
I mean, who needs all these game shows

02:38.040 --> 02:43.310
with fuckin' tools in togs
getting voted off an island

02:43.360 --> 02:45.590
by a bunch of other tools in togs

02:45.640 --> 02:47.310
because he couldn't find the chocolate bar

02:47.360 --> 02:48.470
inside the treasure chest?

02:48.520 --> 02:51.550
I mean... Come on.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.070
We don't... I mean, whose reality's
that? It's not my reality.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.190
Jesus Christ, I haven't got
all day. He said 10:00, yeah?

02:56.240 --> 02:57.310
Ah, yeah.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.910
Come on, who needs to watch

02:58.960 --> 03:00.790
yet another fuckwit

03:00.840 --> 03:04.510
who wants to open an Asian
fusion Devonshire teahouse

03:04.560 --> 03:06.110
sobbing into burnt broccoli?

03:06.160 --> 03:07.150
- Not the cutters?
- No.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.990
Just out of interest,
what... what did you...

03:09.040 --> 03:13.070
.. what did you boys like to
watch when you were little kids?

03:13.120 --> 03:14.750
What spoke to you?

03:14.800 --> 03:16.190
What fired your interest?

03:16.240 --> 03:20.070
Oh, I always liked that, um, wrestling.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.110
Yeah.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.670
I did, eh.

03:22.720 --> 03:23.990
- No, I liked...
- Yeah?

03:24.040 --> 03:25.110
.. I liked a bit of that too.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.590
- What time you got, Stig?
- Uh, 9:57.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.110
I loved the wrestling.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.560
Loved it!

03:34.440 --> 03:36.180
What about film?

03:49.800 --> 03:51.430
After you, Ms Brown.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.390
Huntley-Brown, actually.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.230
We'll be needing two glasses.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.750
Thank you.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.900
Good to see you.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.910
So where's Shirl?

04:05.960 --> 04:09.270
You know you can't even
smoke in prison anymore.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.270
Poor lamb. She's in the
parking lot with Qi.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.060
Qi? Who's Qi? What happened to Sybilla?

04:16.760 --> 04:19.310
She's strayed again,
has she? Oh, I'm sorry.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.790
Leopards and spots, my
darling, leopards and spots.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.350
When will I ever learn?

04:24.400 --> 04:25.870
But don't we need her?

04:25.920 --> 04:28.430
I mean, she's been a valuable member
of this team for 20 years now.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.750
She knows a lot.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.590
It's 126 charges, Hunter.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.750
You need a junior.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.600
I'm aware of that.

04:36.680 --> 04:41.150
Shirl and I have been considering
our options very carefully.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.990
There is only one choice --

04:43.040 --> 04:44.230
Cleaver.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.990
Cleaver? Cleaver Greene?!

04:47.040 --> 04:48.710
Think about it.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.960
Is there any other Cleaver?

04:54.800 --> 04:56.840
Oh. Oh...

05:01.280 --> 05:03.080
He's with Raymond.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.550
Oh, shit.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.030
Sometimes they make a good film,
sometimes they make a shit film!

05:08.080 --> 05:09.230
It happens!

05:09.280 --> 05:12.870
I just don't think an Edith Wharton
novel was the way for Scorsese to go!

05:12.920 --> 05:15.510
Yes, but to me, it's all about the
costumes and the production design!

05:15.560 --> 05:17.910
What I like about Scorsese is... Oh, God!

05:17.960 --> 05:19.510
About time.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.430
- Here, hold this.
- Well, should I get started?

05:21.480 --> 05:23.670
No! Mate, he was very specific, yes?

05:23.720 --> 05:25.150
Specific.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.070
Yes, Ed?

05:27.120 --> 05:29.390
What? I'm sorry?

05:29.440 --> 05:30.990
No, mate, I'm on the verge here.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.910
This is incredibly unprofessional.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.550
I put a lot of work into these jobs.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.270
You know, they don't just
happen because you click

05:36.320 --> 05:38.460
your fingers at me, buddy.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.310
Alright, fine.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.350
But I want my money.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.400
Bastard!

05:49.720 --> 05:51.670
Do you understand

05:51.720 --> 05:54.390
that I will determine who I kill

05:54.440 --> 05:56.950
and the circumstances
in which I kill them?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.790
You can tell him that
when you see him in hell.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.830
Ray! Stop!

06:00.880 --> 06:03.350
The boss tells you to
stop, you fuckin' stop.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.670
the boss!

06:04.720 --> 06:05.870
No, you're not!

06:05.920 --> 06:09.480
How many times do we have
to go through that? Fuck!

06:12.160 --> 06:13.750
Who's the boss?

06:13.800 --> 06:14.990
Not you.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.790
That was a good show, though. In the '80s.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.670
- Did you see it?
- Who's The Boss?

06:18.720 --> 06:19.910
- Tony Danza?
- Yeah.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.750
- Fuck, he was funny.
- Oh, I loved that show.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.470
Loved that guy.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.200
Get out. They're expecting you.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.510
Deliveries for the rear.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.830
Oh, I think I'm here to meet someone.

07:24.880 --> 07:25.910
Whom?

07:25.960 --> 07:30.030
I don't know whom, although
there was a young lady...

07:30.080 --> 07:32.030
It's alright, Janet. He's with me.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.950
Very good, Ms Huntley-Brown.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.190
Hunter?

07:35.240 --> 07:38.910
But there is the matter of the dress code.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.630
Indeed there is, Janet.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.620
Could you be a dear and
help Mr Greene out?

07:45.670 --> 07:46.670
Apologies, Cleaver.

07:46.720 --> 07:51.400
This is a woman's only club and
they do have some quaint house rules.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.150
Let me be perfectly frank, my darling.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.430
126 charges -- it's too
much for me, Cleaver.

07:58.480 --> 08:03.550
I'm beyond autumn, and already
feeling the bite of oncoming winter.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.670
The load is too burdensome.

08:05.720 --> 08:08.590
I don't just need a
junior. I need co-counsel.

08:08.640 --> 08:12.030
So Edgar wants me to be your
co-counsel? That makes sense.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.870
I mean, I've just spent four
months in hiding from the man.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.310
Yet he speaks so fondly of you.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.150
I was this close to an
unanaesthetised colonoscopy

08:20.200 --> 08:21.190
courtesy of him.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.870
Time to forgive and forget.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.230
Come on, have some nibbles.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.030
- I don't want nibbles.
- They do excellent nibbles.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.550
I don't want nibbles. I want my life back.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.030
And you shall have it.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.909
You will be paid handsomely, of course.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.240
And... given the high
profile of the trial...

08:37.440 --> 08:39.710
Right. Yeah.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.870
Suppose it... suppose it
will be quite high profile.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.750
No bigger trial.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.670
And we have a very good chance of victory.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.230
There's no chance of victory.

08:50.280 --> 08:54.070
Most of the murders are fine.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.110
A lot of the witnesses have
mysteriously disappeared

08:56.160 --> 08:57.110
over the years

08:57.160 --> 08:59.950
or come to an untimely conclusion.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.870
The money laundering
could be a bit tricky,

09:02.920 --> 09:04.670
but that's my department.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.790
The arms dealing?

09:05.840 --> 09:07.470
Heavily padded there.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.190
And the drugs -- hundreds
of kilos of coke!

09:10.240 --> 09:13.390
That's where you come to
the fore, my co-counsel.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.870
You know these people.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.590
You know their mindset.

09:16.640 --> 09:22.070
And you have a spanking track
record of defending drug dealers.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.750
Cleaver, you're a lawyer.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.470
You have a duty to justice.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.260
What do you say?

09:30.040 --> 09:32.440
What sort of fee are we talking?

09:32.600 --> 09:35.310
- Weren't you once a lawyer?
- And a damn good one!

09:35.360 --> 09:38.670
What kind of bloody madras curry
law school did you go to, eh?

09:38.720 --> 09:40.910
Look, let me put it into
layman's terms for you,

09:40.960 --> 09:43.070
you Sheikness, or whatever you
want to bloody call yourself.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.350
Rip him into, Cal.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.070
Your brother is happy
wandering the streets,

09:46.120 --> 09:49.030
spouting this bile while in
possession of a deadly weapon...

09:49.080 --> 09:50.150
What weapon?

09:50.200 --> 09:52.710
He was not armed. It was a walking stick.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.230
Oh, why don't you both just hop on a plane

09:54.280 --> 09:55.350
and get the hell out of here?

09:55.400 --> 09:57.990
I tell you what, I'll
chip in for the airfare.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.870
I'm Cal McGregor, and we'll be
right back after this short break.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.790
But when it came to the
126 charges against

10:03.840 --> 10:06.150
criminal lawyer Edgar Thompson,

10:06.200 --> 10:08.470
the former New South
Wales attorney-general

10:08.520 --> 10:09.990
seemed positively reverential

10:10.040 --> 10:12.430
when it came to the
presumption of innocence.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.550
The charges against Mr
Thompson are many and serious.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.750
But we mustn't rush to
judgement on this matter.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.390
We must be patient and calm,

10:21.440 --> 10:23.830
and pay the justice system, as a whole,

10:23.880 --> 10:26.350
the respect it so thoroughly deserves.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.830
So, whatever happened to
the idea of justice for all,

10:29.880 --> 10:32.470
and not simply justice for one's mates?

10:32.520 --> 10:35.070
Yes, surprise, surprise --

10:35.120 --> 10:36.950
not one single news outlet

10:37.000 --> 10:39.190
has reported the fact that Edgar Thompson

10:39.240 --> 10:43.670
was once described by Mr McGregor
as "one of my oldest and best mates.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.920
"The sort of bloke you
would die in a ditch for."

10:47.840 --> 10:50.240
Fuckin' smug ABC arsehole!

10:51.720 --> 10:54.320
Where the fuck they get that from?

11:00.080 --> 11:01.670
Cleaver, this is Shirl.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.430
You know Shirl.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.230
- Yes.
- She's just back from Tokyo.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.590
Hello, Shirl.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.990
And this is Qi.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.470
Longest bloody flight of my life.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.150
Eight fucking sleeping tablets
just to make the distance.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.750
Smoked five fags before
I could get in the taxi.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.430
Yeah, then we stopped
halfway for two more.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.480
Yes, we did, my lover.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.790
Don't you just want a handful
of that for yourself?

11:22.840 --> 11:24.950
I was just speaking to Cleaver
about the drug charges.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.950
You do your thing, Cleaver.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.230
Just remember, this case
is really about money.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.910
That's how they're going
to get him, alright?

11:31.960 --> 11:35.430
- Really, darling...
- 12.3 million in Swelt bonds.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.870
12.6.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.190
A billion in derivatives

11:38.240 --> 11:41.470
run through three instrumentalities
in Budapest and a Cameroon trust.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.870
1.265 billion.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.430
746K in Buda Bank.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.670
5.1 in Cameroon.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.310
But that is nothing without Liechtenstein.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.390
I hope you're listening to me, Hunter.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.070
Like gems from the bard, petal.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.230
You need to build a wall
around fuckin' Liechtenstein.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.190
Get them to focus on the
Caymans and the Dutch Antilles.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.710
I can camouflage that easy peasy.

12:00.440 --> 12:04.350
If Liechtenstein goes down, though,
the body count will be Somme-like.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.350
Don't we need to consider the charges...

12:06.400 --> 12:09.640
Are you fuckin' deaf? There
is only Liechtenstein.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.640
Shirley, I think you need
to go back on the patches.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.920
I don't call this a paper.
I don't even call it a rag.

12:28.320 --> 12:31.190
I don't think it's worthy
of the title 'dunny roll'.

12:31.240 --> 12:35.400
Even in extremis, gentlemen, I
would not put this near my bum.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.990
We're all on edge with
this Thompson thing, but...

12:39.040 --> 12:41.440
Hey! I am in the frame here now!

12:43.280 --> 12:47.390
You blokes have to understand
one thing -- you are expendable.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.710
What matters is if I go down.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.430
I am the past, present and
future of our voice in this state.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.270
But I can't seem to go too
soft on him 'cause of this

12:57.320 --> 12:58.550
Media Watch fuckery.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.070
Nor can we.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.270
So, our esteemed Director
of Public Prosecutions,

13:04.320 --> 13:07.590
what can we offer Edgar
to buy his silence?

13:07.640 --> 13:09.470
Nothing more.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.590
Cal, there were potentially 500 charges.

13:12.640 --> 13:15.590
We've whittled them down to
126. We can't forgive any more.

13:15.640 --> 13:18.230
Our hands are tied, Cal. This
is in the legal realm now.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.910
There are 57 charges that
have political implications

13:20.960 --> 13:21.990
and/or connections.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.310
Yes, mainly concerning very
large donations to both parties

13:25.360 --> 13:27.510
from nonexistent entities
both foreign and domestic.

13:27.560 --> 13:31.510
Then there's a little extortion,
bribery and a bunch of land deals.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.510
If we could shake those 57 free...

13:33.560 --> 13:37.520
No, it would stink of political
expediency. You can't.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.230
So, what, you're going to
be Ed's junior barrister?

13:43.280 --> 13:44.430
No, his co-counsel.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.910
Oh, Cleave, this is the frog
and the scorpion all over again.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.310
Look, I didn't exactly
have a mountain of choice.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.030
It wasn't like, "Oh, do
you want an all-expenses

13:53.080 --> 13:54.350
"jaunt to the Maldives,

13:54.400 --> 13:55.910
"or do you want to represent Ed?"

13:55.960 --> 14:00.230
- I'm just happy to be alive, right?
- You do have choices, Cleaver.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.190
You go to the cops, you tell
them he had you kidnapped,

14:02.240 --> 14:03.670
you tell them they nearly killed you.

14:03.720 --> 14:04.950
Yeah, right.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.550
The last cop I met was
wearing a bullet in his brain.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.550
Right -- so you're now...
you're going to be representing

14:09.600 --> 14:11.030
the man that you hid from for four months.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.520
Ah...

14:13.680 --> 14:15.430
Cleave, have you spent
any time at all reflecting

14:15.480 --> 14:17.750
on the patterns in your life?

14:18.840 --> 14:23.830
On the upside, it'll be very
well paid and very high profile.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.430
Could be just what I need.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.230
This is Edgar Thompson
we're talking about.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.910
The man who hid cocaine
in our vacuum cleaner.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.840
Uh, no, he didn't, actually.

14:33.800 --> 14:34.830
You said it was him.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.830
I was a little strung out at the time

14:36.880 --> 14:39.270
and you'd found all my
other hiding places.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.680
What?

14:41.680 --> 14:42.820
Oh.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.990
Not a fuckin' word.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.710
You weren't around to tell, Cleave.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.110
Oh, and you didn't think
it might be polite to wait?

14:52.160 --> 14:54.110
You didn't think I might
be interested to know

14:54.160 --> 14:55.350
I was being evicted

14:55.400 --> 14:58.270
from the only place I've ever
lived in for the last 12 years?

14:58.320 --> 14:59.790
12 years free rent, Cleave.

14:59.840 --> 15:04.190
You forget it was me your father
asked to keep you out of prison

15:04.240 --> 15:06.150
on some very serious drug charges.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.070
I was innocent! The jury said so.

15:08.120 --> 15:12.470
The jury said so because of me,
and I never billed you for it.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.510
This flat, that was the
deal I struck with your dad

15:15.560 --> 15:16.510
on a handshake.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.150
That was the way we rolled
back then in those days --

15:19.200 --> 15:20.790
handshakes between men.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.750
God rest his soul.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.390
I would have done three
years tops, Cleave.

15:25.440 --> 15:28.150
Three years. That's
nine years free rent, OK?

15:28.200 --> 15:30.630
Enough. Enough is enough.
Finito, capisce? You're out.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.910
Done. Capisce. Fuck me.

15:32.960 --> 15:36.030
Where's... what have you
done with my stuff? Capisce?

15:36.080 --> 15:38.620
Are you gonna pay for your coffee?

15:46.960 --> 15:48.550
- Anna, it's me.
- Hey, stranger.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.710
- You got my invite?
- Yep, I'm looking at it.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.150
- You coming?
- Uh, depends.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.790
- Did you invite Bevan?
- Yep.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.030
And he's coming, right?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.150
Yep.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.940
Then no, I can't.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.630
I couldn't face him.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.550
Last time I saw him was our wedding day

16:03.600 --> 16:05.590
and I was carrying another man's baby.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.110
He's moved on, Nic. He's forgiven you.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.470
How can he move on? I
haven't forgiven myself.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.870
I spent a year just staring in a mirror

16:13.920 --> 16:16.310
trying to figure out who the hell I
am and how I could do that to him.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.870
He's fine. He's gone on to great things.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.190
You should check out his website.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.470
He apparently made a fortune
out of this app he created.

16:22.520 --> 16:23.830
I told him you might come,

16:23.880 --> 16:26.110
and he said that he'd
love to see you again.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.910
Bevan did not say that.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.430
Well, he said he wouldn't kill you,

16:29.480 --> 16:32.510
which in the context of you being
a skank ho is about the same thing.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.030
Please come.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.950
I'll think about it.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.520
Bevan? No way!

16:51.800 --> 16:54.190
- How'd it go?
- With the insurance guys?

16:54.240 --> 16:57.710
Fantastic! My God, what a fabulous bunch.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.390
Right -- so I take it
we're still on the hook.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.430
You know, both of the armed
services, Australian and Kiwi,

17:02.480 --> 17:04.510
used three choppers each.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.630
That's six choppers to
find one man in a balloon.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.910
It's a scam!

17:08.960 --> 17:11.430
I mean, if they're not at
war, what else are they doing?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.190
Rescuing people for profit.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.990
Well, tell 'em you'll pay for petrol.

17:15.040 --> 17:19.109
Six choppers, two frigates,
assorted "supporting vessels",

17:19.160 --> 17:20.750
one poor bastard in a balloon.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.230
"That'll be 1.2 million, thank you, sir.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.589
"Now, will that be cash or credit?

17:24.640 --> 17:26.750
"Or will you be splitting the
bill with Mr fucking Greene?"

17:26.800 --> 17:28.390
Are we still having dinner?

17:28.440 --> 17:30.590
He has to accept responsibility for this.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.510
If I have to take him dancing, I'll do so.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.710
OK. Betsy.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.310
No, Cleave -- not Betsy.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.790
- Not Betsy?
- No, she stinks.

17:49.840 --> 17:50.990
She's not coming into my house.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.270
She doesn't stink.

17:52.320 --> 17:58.510
And how... there's so much
activity, so many years of...

17:58.560 --> 18:01.150
A mattress is not a piece of fruit.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.870
You can't eat the mattress
and throw the peel away.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.030
Are you misquoting Miller?

18:06.080 --> 18:08.430
I don't... I don't know, actually.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.470
Well, currently, Cleave,

18:09.520 --> 18:11.510
she's strapped to a wall
covered in piss and come stains,

18:11.560 --> 18:13.230
so I'm not convinced
you've shown her the respect

18:13.280 --> 18:14.230
that she may have deserved.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.950
Alright, fine. Gwyneth comes with me.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.990
Gwyneth... Gwyneth predates you.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.630
Actually, I think Gwyneth
predates Gwyneth.

18:21.680 --> 18:22.670
Cleave,

18:22.720 --> 18:25.550
Gwyneth is a symbol of
everything about your manky life

18:25.600 --> 18:27.350
that doesn't work and you know it.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.430
Oh, very nice.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.310
Let's just give her to a DNA
lab and they can deal with it.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.950
Very... Actually, I am
drawing a line in the sand.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.310
Do you know what?

18:34.360 --> 18:38.030
She has been my rock through
many an emotional storm.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.270
No, Cleaver, she's not
coming into my house.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.910
OK, fine. I'll stay here.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.560
With Gwyneth.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.870
You can't trust any of them.
They all want your job.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.110
The real question is, why
would anyone want my job?

18:55.160 --> 18:57.750
- Six of them are waiting to pounce.
- I know, Chris. I live and breathe.

18:57.800 --> 18:58.830
- Where are we headed?
- Toko.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.390
- In the city?
- That's what the email says.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.870
David, don't cave on Ed Thompson.

19:02.920 --> 19:03.950
You've never met him.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.870
They can't throw shit on you about him.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.230
Take it up to them.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.830
That's how you can differentiate yourself.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.430
If I take it up to them, I'll
lose over half my front bench,

19:12.480 --> 19:14.670
because over half my front bench
have done more than just meet him.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.270
Then name them and shame them.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.470
Call their bluff.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.660
This is the resurrection.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.440
It's him.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.470
- Hello?
- Harry!

19:26.520 --> 19:28.470
- Sorry. David.
- Yes, Stevie?

19:28.520 --> 19:30.670
It's time we reached
out to each other, mate.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.150
You know, hands across
the water sort of thing.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.470
On what particular issue
would that be, Steven?

19:35.520 --> 19:36.790
Homelessness?

19:36.840 --> 19:38.510
This Thompson business.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.270
Really? Thompson? Now there's a surprise.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.510
It's not going to go well
for either of us, mate.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.830
Your party is dead in the
water if he blows his bugle.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.510
We've got to work together on this.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.270
There's just too many bodies, mate.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.550
Right, so we can't get
together on the environment,

19:53.600 --> 19:55.870
affordable housing, domestic violence,

19:55.920 --> 19:58.230
but we can get together to
save a criminal sociopath.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.150
Is that right?

20:00.200 --> 20:03.140
Yep, well, I see your
point, Steven, but...

20:04.320 --> 20:07.420
There is a principle at
stake here, and that...

20:08.280 --> 20:10.190
Right.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.350
OK.

20:11.400 --> 20:16.070
No! That is the final word,
OK? That's my position.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.920
Fuck him, fuck you, fuck the lot of you.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.110
He's hung up, hasn't he?

20:21.160 --> 20:23.150
- Mm, a while back.
- When did he hang up?

20:23.200 --> 20:25.070
After you said no?

20:25.120 --> 20:28.150
No, just after I caved
in entirely on Thompson.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.870
Please don't speak until after lunch.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.550
So, Cleave, this is just
for a couple of days, right?

20:47.600 --> 20:50.630
What? Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.430
Yeah, come on, it'll be
great! Be like old times, huh?

20:53.480 --> 20:56.190
That's exactly what I'm afraid of. Here.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.790
What do you mean, afraid of?

20:57.840 --> 20:59.430
Come on, don't be so negative.

20:59.480 --> 21:03.390
I know life in the fast lane can
be a little blustery at times...

21:03.440 --> 21:06.510
- Oh, blustery?
- .. but it can also be fun, can't it?

21:06.560 --> 21:08.390
What about Vegas, huh?

21:08.440 --> 21:09.830
You really want to bring up Vegas?

21:09.880 --> 21:10.990
Alright, Vegas is a bad example.

21:11.040 --> 21:15.550
What about... what about...
Christmas in Denmark?

21:15.600 --> 21:17.390
- Mmm...
- Positano?

21:17.440 --> 21:18.670
- Yeah, well...
- Beautiful.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.950
- Yeah, that was OK.
- Beautiful.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.350
That was mainly to do with the location.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.630
What about Marrakesh? Beautiful.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.270
Oh, two weeks in a hash
haze courtesy of guess who.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.070
Well, that was a gift, if you remember,

21:27.120 --> 21:29.470
for being, as he put it,

21:29.520 --> 21:31.750
"the best associate that he'd ever had

21:31.800 --> 21:33.830
"in his entire stinking life," huh?

21:33.880 --> 21:36.400
He needed to repay my skills...

21:39.480 --> 21:42.600
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

21:44.080 --> 21:47.230
That was my present to you on
our first wedding anniversary.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.520
I know. I know.

22:15.160 --> 22:20.600
Bet if I looked hard enough,
I'd find a gas bill from 1985.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.230
"Merry Christmas to darling
Wendy, from Santa."

22:25.280 --> 22:27.720
1978, no less.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.220
- Hi, David.
- Hi, David!

22:48.280 --> 22:50.190
Hi, guys.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.390
- How are we?
- We're great, thanks, David.

22:52.440 --> 22:55.310
Better take your shoes off.
Mum's new rule in the house.

22:55.360 --> 22:58.300
Well, I'd better obey
her rules, then, huh?

22:59.560 --> 23:01.750
Yeah, we have to wear slippers now.

23:01.800 --> 23:02.950
Mum said we should give you these.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.340
Oh, wow.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.030
Thank you, guys.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.350
That means a lot. Thank you.

23:18.760 --> 23:19.790
What the hell is...

23:19.840 --> 23:22.630
Oh, what the hell is that?!

23:22.680 --> 23:25.070
Who did this, huh?

23:25.120 --> 23:27.110
- Did you do this? Did you?
- Mum!

23:27.160 --> 23:28.430
- Mum!
- Mum!

23:28.480 --> 23:29.590
Did you do this?

23:29.640 --> 23:30.750
- Did you?
- Let him go!

23:30.800 --> 23:32.030
What are you doing to my children?

23:32.080 --> 23:33.710
This is not funny, alright? All of you!

23:33.760 --> 23:36.150
You! You leave my children alone.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.550
They put dog shit in my slippers, Scarlet.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.990
Let's... let's not leap to conclusions.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.830
What dog on earth takes
a dump in both slippers?

23:43.880 --> 23:46.420
Or have you trained it to do that?

23:49.720 --> 23:51.870
Did you do this?

23:51.920 --> 23:53.800
You promise me?

23:56.880 --> 23:58.470
They say they didn't.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.590
Under the circumstances...

23:59.640 --> 24:02.510
They have been playing
stupid practical jokes on me

24:02.560 --> 24:04.470
ever since I first walked in here!

24:04.520 --> 24:05.830
It's your word against theirs, David.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.120
OK.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.710
They put dog shit in my slippers, Scarlet.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.440
Dog shit!

24:51.800 --> 24:55.310
Cleave! Where are you?
I've been dying to see you!

24:55.360 --> 24:57.710
Ah, I'm meeting Barn at the Wood.

24:57.760 --> 24:58.830
The Wood?

24:58.880 --> 25:01.830
The Wood on Crown or the Wood on Foster?

25:01.880 --> 25:03.910
- Foster.
- Cool.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.710
I'm... I'm, like, five minutes away.

25:05.760 --> 25:08.150
OK. Can you make it a halfer?

25:08.200 --> 25:09.750
I've got some stuff to talk to Barn about.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.940
Yep. See you in a halfer.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.190
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.590
Come on, give us a cuddle.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.590
Huh?

25:20.640 --> 25:23.240
If it leads to sex, it leads to sex.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.950
What can you do?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.510
Oh, yes.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.960
Oh, you've made a little
effort for me. That's nice.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.520
Fuck!

25:43.040 --> 25:44.270
Fuck...

25:44.320 --> 25:46.600
Fuck, fuck, FUCK!

25:48.160 --> 25:50.550
- 1.2 million, Cleave.
- Yeah.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.590
That's the bill.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.030
- That's a lot.
- I didn't book the balloon.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.550
I never met the guy who owned the balloon.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.870
I wasn't the one who
untethered the balloon.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.710
- I was just the guy...
- Just the guy in the basket, yep.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.110
Yes, I've heard it.

26:03.160 --> 26:06.230
Um... look, don't worry.
It won't be a problem.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.550
It is a problem.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.350
I've spent the day with their lawyers.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.510
I've had to put up 50 grand

26:11.560 --> 26:13.790
just so they won't start
proceedings against me.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.270
Was that wise?

26:15.320 --> 26:18.270
I mean, what about culpability?

26:18.320 --> 26:20.110
Did you game that out very well?

26:20.160 --> 26:23.150
Where's all your medical insurance, mate?

26:23.200 --> 26:25.110
I doubt it even covers
me for a heart attack,

26:25.160 --> 26:26.990
let alone getting lost in a balloon.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.070
Hold on a minute.

26:28.120 --> 26:33.750
Did you say they're taking
proceedings against me, meaning you?

26:33.800 --> 26:35.270
Yeah.

26:35.320 --> 26:39.910
Right. So they're not making
any claims against me, as such?

26:39.960 --> 26:42.390
- Cleaver, don't you
fucking dare. - What?

26:42.440 --> 26:44.270
OK. It's alright, Nana.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.790
Alright, calm down.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.270
A nice hot cup of tea,
a Bex, little lie-down.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.190
It's alright. I will deal with it.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.790
But you won't deal with it.

26:51.840 --> 26:55.390
You will lie, procrastinate, hide,

26:55.440 --> 26:58.310
then run away and leave me
in the shit to sort it out

26:58.360 --> 27:00.950
because that is all you ever bloody do!

27:01.000 --> 27:02.190
Hey!

27:02.240 --> 27:03.510
Mate...

27:03.560 --> 27:05.270
.. what about we try and remember

27:05.320 --> 27:07.630
the circumstances in which this arose, OK?

27:07.680 --> 27:08.790
Don't poke me, please.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.230
Well, I'm just poking you in the
same way as you poked me, huh?

27:11.280 --> 27:12.430
To make your little point.

27:12.480 --> 27:13.830
Well, do it without your finger.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.590
Well, what do you want
me to poke you with, huh?

27:15.640 --> 27:16.710
You need to hear this.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.470
You had cancer, my friend,
and I was looking after you.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.470
Your life was shit. And what did I do?

27:21.520 --> 27:23.590
I got you a beautiful
gift. A balloon ride.

27:23.640 --> 27:27.070
And, yes, things might have
gone a little awry, OK,

27:27.120 --> 27:28.310
and you went to New Zealand,

27:28.360 --> 27:29.990
but my intentions were good.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.470
Oh, you can't even do good well.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.830
Who's got all the morning TV shows?

27:33.880 --> 27:35.190
Who's got all the book deals?

27:35.240 --> 27:36.790
Who doesn't have cancer anymore?

27:36.840 --> 27:38.550
I bet you're fuckin' raking it in, mate.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.310
And so far, not so much as a,

27:40.360 --> 27:41.310
"Thank you, Cleave."

27:41.360 --> 27:42.350
You're not serious?

27:42.400 --> 27:43.710
I am serious.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.670
You are a walking Fukushima reactor.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.790
Oh, well, fuck you, Shima.
Let go of my fuckin' finger.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.470
I told you not to poke
me. You wouldn't listen.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.390
Now I've got yours.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.190
And now I've got yours!

27:55.240 --> 27:56.430
Let it go.

27:56.480 --> 28:00.070
Oh, no! Oh, what's gonna happen now?

28:00.120 --> 28:01.870
Oh, spooky!

28:01.920 --> 28:03.710
Spooky, isn't it? Let go, fuckhead.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.510
No, you let go of mine,
then I'll let go of yours.

28:05.560 --> 28:08.990
What is this, a bloody
Balinese finger puppetry?

28:09.040 --> 28:11.150
Let go of the fuckin' finger!

28:11.200 --> 28:14.230
Alright, Barney, I'll let
go. I'll let go first, OK?

28:14.280 --> 28:15.390
Alright, we'll let go together.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.800
Here we go. One, two...

28:25.480 --> 28:26.990
Don't do that again.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.070
- Hey!
- What?

28:28.120 --> 28:31.060
- That? - No, no, no,
no -- more like that.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.520
That?!

28:33.560 --> 28:35.310
This, eh? Yes?

28:35.360 --> 28:36.430
- Yeah.
- Ohh!

28:36.480 --> 28:37.820
Come on!

28:38.600 --> 28:40.550
Come on! Come on, fuckhead!

28:40.600 --> 28:42.470
Yeah, you fuckin'...

28:49.040 --> 28:51.870
What the fuck is wrong with you?

28:51.920 --> 28:53.320
Sorry.

28:54.720 --> 28:58.830
I don't know. I just saw red.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.350
Right.

29:00.400 --> 29:04.600
So, not Barney and me -- red?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.540
Pretty much.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.510
You OK?

29:10.560 --> 29:13.100
Oh, don't touch me, either of you.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.190
You're on the hook for this, Cleave.

29:15.240 --> 29:18.280
Yeah, yeah. Lady's finger.

29:27.280 --> 29:32.750
Oh, this is a shade below the
penthouse suite at the Sheraton

29:32.800 --> 29:34.510
from last time.

29:34.560 --> 29:37.990
This? It's just a place to
crash. It's only very temporary.

29:38.040 --> 29:41.190
Most of my money's still
tied up in the States.

29:41.240 --> 29:44.910
I had a lot of legal bills
after this whole Lyle bullshit.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.550
He's such a prick. Can't
believe I fell for him.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.790
Yeah.

29:48.840 --> 29:52.510
Anyway, I actually have this
amazing apartment lined up,

29:52.560 --> 29:54.630
but the fucking real estate agent!

29:54.680 --> 29:58.120
So this is me for a week, maybe two.

30:03.280 --> 30:07.240
It is so good to see you.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.150
Mm-hm.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.550
You too.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.350
I see it now, you know.

30:15.400 --> 30:18.500
You've always been the
one that's there for me.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.390
Mm-hm.

30:21.440 --> 30:24.990
Miss? What's going on?

30:25.040 --> 30:26.790
Nothing.

30:26.840 --> 30:27.870
Uh-huh...

30:27.920 --> 30:29.510
Just writing another bestseller.

30:29.560 --> 30:30.590
Uh-huh...

30:30.640 --> 30:32.350
You know, when I'm in my writing mode,

30:32.400 --> 30:34.110
I just go into my own world, you know?

30:34.160 --> 30:35.870
Mm-hm. Um...

30:35.920 --> 30:38.990
So... party night.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.830
Are you... holding?

30:40.880 --> 30:42.350
- Holding?
- You know...

30:42.400 --> 30:44.590
Yeah, yeah, I know what holding means.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.270
Um... how much are you doing?

30:46.320 --> 30:47.950
Me? Hardly any.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.350
The odd social line.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.470
Come on -- don't bullshit a bullshitter.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.830
I've read the papers, for one thing.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.750
I was just thinking that
we could have some fun.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.910
Don't you remember the old party nights?

30:58.960 --> 30:59.950
Mmm.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.270
From memory you used to
know a guy called, uh... Sam.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.910
Um, this isn't a party night, sweetheart,

31:05.960 --> 31:08.990
and, no, I don't do it anymore.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.950
But you probably still have
his number, wouldn't you?

31:12.000 --> 31:16.790
Sam is the last person you
need to see, my darling.

31:16.840 --> 31:20.070
Um, where's the bathroom? I've
got to clean this shit off me.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.390
Oh, it's just down the hall.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.680
I was just asking.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.830
- I'm OK.
- Mm-hm.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.440
I know fucked up when I see it.

32:03.680 --> 32:06.150
Do you remember when you used
to come and visit me in rehab?

32:06.200 --> 32:08.600
Remember what that looked like?

32:09.880 --> 32:14.150
Now, listen, I've had a
bit of a bad day today,

32:14.200 --> 32:16.590
but I'm going to call you
first thing in the morning,

32:16.640 --> 32:18.150
and we're going to sort you out.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.540
Alright?

32:20.840 --> 32:22.400
I love you.

32:24.920 --> 32:26.640
I love you too.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.120
Enough not to give you Sam's number.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.800
Sleep, darlin'.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.550
Sam, Sam, Sam.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.270
Is this Sam? I'm a friend
of Cleaver Greene's.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.390
Sorry to wake you. Wrong Sam.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.590
Yes. Cleaver Greene, Sam.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.830
I'm just in from out of town

33:11.880 --> 33:13.510
and he said I should give you a call.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.670
Yes, this is Cleaver Greene's phone.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.470
He lent it to me.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.310
No, I will not tell him that!

33:19.360 --> 33:20.880
Fuck you!

33:35.320 --> 33:36.950
We did do it.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.230
I know you did.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.480
Go back to bed, sweetheart.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.420
I don't feel like talking anymore.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.230
Hi. What are you doing here?

34:01.280 --> 34:04.350
I just, uh, need to see the kids.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.990
- It's not your night.
- Is David here?

34:07.040 --> 34:08.870
No, he's gone.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.920
Well, come on in, then.

34:14.600 --> 34:18.600
Um, I'll just see 'em
and then I'll go, OK?

34:21.600 --> 34:22.940
You OK?

34:24.199 --> 34:26.760
Yeah. David and I had a fight.

34:28.280 --> 34:29.590
- The kids...
- What about them?

34:29.639 --> 34:31.790
- What did he do?
- No, he didn't do anything.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.159
It was just... It was...

34:35.480 --> 34:37.480
.. a misunderstanding.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.020
What do you want?

34:58.480 --> 35:00.080
To see you.

35:42.560 --> 35:45.680
You're still vitamising compost, I see.

35:47.600 --> 35:48.710
Oh!

35:48.760 --> 35:51.070
Can you please do up your dressing-gown?

35:51.120 --> 35:54.030
Oh, nothing that you
haven't seen before, baby.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.030
It's not something I particularly
want to be reminded of.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.710
What happened to you last night?

35:57.760 --> 36:00.710
Oh, got into a bit of a tangle with Barn.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.390
Where's my fucking phone?

36:02.440 --> 36:03.630
I can't find it any...

36:03.680 --> 36:04.910
Can I borrow yours?

36:04.960 --> 36:07.700
Well, you're borrowing everything else.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.910
Right. What's my number?

36:12.550 --> 36:13.550
You don't know your number?

36:13.600 --> 36:15.950
Who knows their own numbers these days?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.030
- Nobody knows their own numbers.
- It's in my phone.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.830
We all used to know
each other's numbers --

36:19.880 --> 36:22.110
you remember, in the pre-Cambrian era?

36:22.160 --> 36:23.150
Mm.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.870
Friendly, friendly times, the olden days.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.390
We all knew each other's numbers.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.830
OK, it's not under C
or G. What's it under?

36:29.880 --> 36:31.230
S for Sexy Pants?

36:31.280 --> 36:32.750
Or is it under D for Darling Heart?

36:32.800 --> 36:34.910
- It's under E.
- E? What's E?

36:34.960 --> 36:36.470
Actually, it's probably
easier if I just...

36:36.520 --> 36:37.870
Cleaver, can you give me the phone?

36:37.920 --> 36:39.110
Edwards.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.150
El...

36:40.200 --> 36:42.080
.. Fucko.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.790
- That's my number. 'El Fucko'?
- Oh, sorry.

36:45.840 --> 36:47.030
- Are you serious?
- Sorry! I'm sorry!

36:47.080 --> 36:48.030
That's my number?

36:48.080 --> 36:49.870
It's just something that Fuzz
heard me saying about you

36:49.920 --> 36:51.030
when he was little

36:51.080 --> 36:52.030
and then he started saying it

36:52.080 --> 36:53.630
and then sometimes when
you're not around we...

36:53.680 --> 36:54.870
- It's just... it's a joke.
- Oh, 'we'?

36:54.920 --> 36:58.150
Oh, so my boy has been calling
me El Fucko since he was a boy?

36:58.200 --> 36:59.910
It's a nickname. A nickname.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.960
That's not a nickname.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.670
Fatty is a n... Hendo is a nickname.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.030
Curly is a nickname.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.110
That's...

37:07.160 --> 37:09.790
So what, did Barney punch you in the face?

37:09.840 --> 37:12.920
Uh, no, Missy punched me...

37:15.280 --> 37:17.680
.. Missy punched me in the f...

37:18.240 --> 37:20.710
Let me just give El Fucko a bell.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.110
Miss, it's me.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.150
I know what you're doing.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.870
I know you flogged my fucking phone

37:29.920 --> 37:31.950
so you can get in touch with my ex-dealer,

37:32.000 --> 37:33.590
but I need it back, OK?

37:33.640 --> 37:36.230
I'm about to defend Australia's
biggest crim! Give me back my phone!

37:36.280 --> 37:38.110
Thank you very much.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.870
Shit.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.920
Don't know how we came
up with that nickname.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.710
So we thought we'd have this lunch

37:50.760 --> 37:53.950
to make it clear that
we wish Edgar godspeed,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.190
and that comes from
both sides of the house.

37:56.240 --> 38:00.790
Well, God tends to set an excellent pace.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.590
I presume that means you're
picking up the bill, Cal.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.510
And although we're not
really in a position

38:05.560 --> 38:06.790
to influence the courts...

38:06.840 --> 38:09.030
Oh, please. As if one would ask.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.310
Absolutely.

38:10.360 --> 38:13.310
But, Hunter, let me just say firstly,

38:13.360 --> 38:15.990
we do need a bit of clarification, guys,

38:16.040 --> 38:17.870
on who's picking up the tab here.

38:17.920 --> 38:21.110
Cleaver, the lunch is on me. Go hog wild.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.190
Very well.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.470
Garcon.

38:23.520 --> 38:25.070
We have persuaded Norton here,

38:25.120 --> 38:27.710
really for reasons of clarification
more than anything else,

38:27.760 --> 38:31.030
to substantially reduce the
number of charges against Edgar.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.870
What do you think, Cleaver?

38:32.920 --> 38:37.590
Well, the question is quantum, Hunter.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.430
The quantum is the question.

38:40.480 --> 38:44.990
Now, let me put it to you on
behalf of the defence, guys,

38:45.040 --> 38:48.790
in a way that is both
rational and expository.

38:48.840 --> 38:53.230
What in the name of
fuck are you offering us?

38:53.280 --> 38:58.710
Apart from the Romanee-Conti
Grand Cru 1975.

38:58.760 --> 39:01.590
Well, we haven't really put an exact
number on it yet, have we, Norton?

39:01.640 --> 39:03.030
No, not exact.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.990
But the sort of figure
we're tossing around...

39:05.040 --> 39:07.630
- Perhaps...
- Because... for argument's sake,

39:07.680 --> 39:10.470
and I'm just pulling a number
out of the thin air here,

39:10.520 --> 39:11.510
you understand...

39:11.560 --> 39:12.590
Of course.

39:12.640 --> 39:16.840
.. a reduction of 57 charges
clearly wouldn't work for Edgar.

39:19.160 --> 39:23.150
The secret of good pate
is to force-feed the goose

39:23.200 --> 39:24.750
before you kill it.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.830
That's when their organ
juices start to flow.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.670
Let me put it another way.

39:29.720 --> 39:33.470
How much jail time would
Edgar be prepared to spend?

39:33.520 --> 39:36.110
Would he be comfortable with, say, 10?

39:36.160 --> 39:37.300
10?

39:39.520 --> 39:41.350
- Eight?
- Eight?!

39:41.400 --> 39:44.510
Politically, anything less than
eight would be very, very tricky.

39:44.560 --> 39:47.910
Anything less than 10 years
would be unconscionable.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.270
You'd bring down the entire
apparatus of government.

39:50.320 --> 39:53.910
Since when did the New South Wales
government have an apparatus?

39:53.960 --> 39:55.870
Oh.

39:55.920 --> 40:00.790
Mmm. Oh... my... God!

40:00.840 --> 40:03.230
No, no, no. I won't do it. I
won't do it. All bets are off.

40:03.280 --> 40:07.580
Oh, guys, just have a go at this.
It's going to change your life.

40:08.160 --> 40:12.430
What do you want, Hunter?

40:12.480 --> 40:13.670
Liechtenstein.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.310
Absolutely not!

40:15.360 --> 40:17.350
We are not dropping Liechtenstein.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.030
Liechtenstein is there to stay.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.350
Cleaver, could you be a dear

40:21.400 --> 40:23.230
and just have a quick word with Shirl?

40:23.280 --> 40:25.350
Oh, I suppose so.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.630
Mmm.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.030
Mmm!

40:29.080 --> 40:30.400
Mmm!

40:32.400 --> 40:36.950
Shirl, are we absolutely sure
Liechtenstein's all we want...

40:37.000 --> 40:38.430
She's mine.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.390
- You understand?
- What?

40:40.440 --> 40:43.590
Qi. You keep your hands off him.

40:43.640 --> 40:46.150
She? Him? What are you talking about?

40:46.200 --> 40:47.670
If I catch you trying anything,

40:47.720 --> 40:50.110
there will be only one cock
left between the four of us,

40:50.160 --> 40:51.190
I swear to God.

40:51.240 --> 40:56.670
Shirl... look, you really
need to focus now, OK?

40:56.720 --> 40:58.590
Is Liechtenstein it?

41:03.840 --> 41:07.040
Qi and I have been going
over the numbers again.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.390
We might be weak on the Honduras
Petroleum Alliance as well.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.230
You don't want Honduras.

41:12.280 --> 41:13.990
We don't want Honduras.

41:14.040 --> 41:15.480
OK.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.680
- OK. Thank you, Qi.
- I'm watching you, Cleaver.

41:20.760 --> 41:23.030
My dad was a vivisectionist.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.110
And you.

41:28.160 --> 41:31.230
Cleaver, my love, wonderful news.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.070
Liechtenstein's off the table.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.910
Apparently we need Honduras as well.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.350
Some Petroleum Alliance or some bullshit.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.830
You've got to be joking. I
have to give them something.

41:41.880 --> 41:43.430
As we have discussed, Norton,

41:43.480 --> 41:44.430
you will.

41:44.480 --> 41:45.590
All in good time.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.750
Eighteen grand for a bottle
of plonk?! Are you insane?

41:48.800 --> 41:52.390
It seems entirely reasonable, Cal.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.430
In fact...

41:53.480 --> 41:55.150
We might as well have another bottle.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.150
As well as Honduras.

41:57.200 --> 41:59.030
No. No, no, no.

41:59.080 --> 42:02.110
There's been no pressure from government.

42:02.160 --> 42:04.350
Look, these charges have been dropped

42:04.400 --> 42:07.070
so that I can harness the
full resources of the

42:07.120 --> 42:09.230
Department of Public Prosecutions

42:09.280 --> 42:10.470
on the more serious charges.

42:10.520 --> 42:12.070
What's more serious than murder?

42:12.120 --> 42:13.390
No, it is not political.

42:13.440 --> 42:16.310
The dropped charges involved
very few members of my party,

42:16.360 --> 42:18.830
and those few members regret
it not going to trial.

42:18.880 --> 42:21.710
They were very much looking forward

42:21.760 --> 42:24.950
to clearing their names going forward.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.030
So, Premier,

42:26.080 --> 42:29.320
to these stories of a political
fix in the Edgar Thompson case.

42:30.920 --> 42:34.110
Oh, boy, Cal -- you do
ask the tough questions.

42:34.160 --> 42:35.600
Well...

42:36.640 --> 42:40.070
Let me assure you there
is nothing political here.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.470
I know very little about the case,

42:41.520 --> 42:43.270
and furthermore, the separation of powers

42:43.320 --> 42:46.550
between the government and
the judiciary is sacrosanct.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.950
The idea of some sort of
political fix is ridiculous.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.350
Mmm. No, I take your point, Premier.

42:52.400 --> 42:55.470
There has been a lot of rubbish
published about Edgar Thompson,

42:55.520 --> 42:58.470
especially by the Arseholes
Broadcasting Communism,

42:58.520 --> 43:02.230
or the ABC, as I like
to call 'em for short.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.110
I met the man once at a fundraiser
for handicapped children

43:05.160 --> 43:06.950
and I have been pilloried for it.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.110
I was driving the miniature
train for the kiddies,

43:10.160 --> 43:12.510
and from memory, Thompson
was one of the guards.

43:12.560 --> 43:14.630
Now, I may have put my arm
around him at some stage.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.590
I'm a huggy kind of a guy.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.510
You know, I fondle everyone.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.720
Well, not the kids. Uh...

43:25.200 --> 43:28.200
I'm Cal McGregor and
we'll take a short break.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.470
G'day, Sam.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.150
I had to spend half an hour

43:33.200 --> 43:36.030
explaining your little
friend's phone call to my wife.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.880
Fuck you, Cleaver!

43:39.720 --> 43:41.750
My little friend didn't happen to tell you

43:41.800 --> 43:44.140
where she'd be today, did she?

44:06.600 --> 44:07.940
You see?

44:08.680 --> 44:10.670
He wants to be friends.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.230
Time to forgive and forget.

44:12.280 --> 44:15.760
Oh, believe me, Hunter, I'd
like to forget everything.

44:18.600 --> 44:20.470
What are you doing?

44:24.440 --> 44:26.230
Just get... As you go through
the files, then we can...

44:26.280 --> 44:27.350
Yep.

44:27.400 --> 44:29.150
.. work out what's going on, alright?

44:29.200 --> 44:30.830
Over the weeks ahead,

44:30.880 --> 44:34.150
you will hear some of the
most extraordinary charges

44:34.200 --> 44:36.110
ever heard in this place.

44:36.160 --> 44:38.630
Extortion. Drug running. Money laundering.

44:38.680 --> 44:39.830
Murder. Kidnapping.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.030
The list is endless,

44:41.080 --> 44:44.990
because the man in the
dock, Edgar Allan Thompson,

44:45.040 --> 44:48.310
is possibly the most
dangerous, vindictive,

44:48.360 --> 44:50.500
evil man you will ever...

44:51.440 --> 44:54.550
Uh... Um...

44:54.600 --> 44:57.990
So, yes, anyway, all this will come out

44:58.040 --> 45:01.080
as we, uh... present our case
against him as we go along.

45:02.880 --> 45:04.910
Ms Huntley-Brown.

45:04.960 --> 45:08.270
Quick, quick, quick. Come on,
come on, come on, come on!

45:08.320 --> 45:10.320
Pardon me, Your Honour.

45:11.880 --> 45:13.760
So much paperwork.

45:15.160 --> 45:17.360
And yet so little evidence.

45:18.840 --> 45:22.190
Thaddeus Huntley-Brown, my late father,

45:22.240 --> 45:27.230
was the Anglican vicar of a
small stone church in Surrey,

45:27.280 --> 45:29.760
in England's green south.

45:31.040 --> 45:34.990
The church, built in 1724,

45:35.040 --> 45:37.390
was surrounded by fields

45:37.440 --> 45:42.310
brimming with foxglove, lupins, marigolds,

45:42.360 --> 45:46.480
and the air was always
rich with a scent of roses.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.600
That was my childhood.

45:50.360 --> 45:54.230
And no matter what the weather, my
father and I would go a-rambling.

45:54.280 --> 45:59.590
And I remember chatting to my father
on one of these precious walks

45:59.640 --> 46:03.920
about some particularly awful murder.

46:05.240 --> 46:09.110
And I said, in the plaintive
voice of a 10-year-old child,

46:09.160 --> 46:14.550
"Oh, Daddy, I hope they
hang the man they arrested."

46:14.600 --> 46:21.040
And he looked at me with
his gentle brown eyes...

46:22.920 --> 46:24.430
.. and said,

46:24.480 --> 46:29.630
"I see you have already judged
this man and found him guilty.

46:29.680 --> 46:35.990
"Like the Pharisees of old who
nailed our Lord to the cross,

46:36.040 --> 46:39.880
"your judgement has
come before the trial."

46:42.040 --> 46:46.870
I know in my heart that you, our jury,

46:46.920 --> 46:51.000
will prove better judges
than the 10-year-old me.

46:57.960 --> 46:59.640
Mr Greene.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.990
Ladies and gentlemen,

47:03.040 --> 47:07.070
my antecedents aren't quite as picturesque

47:07.120 --> 47:09.750
as my learned co-counsel's.

47:09.800 --> 47:13.350
My father was the son
of a Catholic priest.

47:13.400 --> 47:14.800
Oh, fuck!

47:15.800 --> 47:19.190
Now, let me turn to the children

47:19.240 --> 47:21.910
whom Edgar Thompson has helped
through his foundation --

47:21.960 --> 47:24.960
Oh, fuck, she's talking
about the foundation.

47:26.720 --> 47:30.630
How many might not still
be here if it hadn't been...

47:30.680 --> 47:32.510
Don't mention the foundation.

47:32.560 --> 47:36.960
That's where he's hidden half the
money. Connects to Liechtenstein.

47:37.280 --> 47:41.390
But let us not dwell on
all Edgar's good works.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.040
To allegations of deeds most foul.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.550
Would it surprise you

47:46.600 --> 47:50.790
to know that we have three witnesses
who have put you at the scene...

47:50.840 --> 47:53.910
She was killed by you in a jealous rage.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.070
Wasn't she?

47:55.120 --> 47:56.110
You claim arson

47:56.160 --> 48:00.190
and yet there is no police report
of a fire having actually happened.

48:00.240 --> 48:01.310
Oh, dear.

48:01.360 --> 48:03.470
Not only were you not
in Sydney at the time,

48:03.520 --> 48:05.110
you weren't even in Australia.

48:05.160 --> 48:07.430
You were in Colombia!

48:07.480 --> 48:10.150
-- The court is being asked
to take the word of a man

48:10.200 --> 48:11.950
who has been twice arrested for perjury.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.390
Don't waste my time!

48:13.440 --> 48:15.750
You've been Skully O'Dwyer's
second-in-command for years,

48:15.800 --> 48:16.830
haven't you?

48:16.880 --> 48:18.670
If anybody was dealing,
it was probably you.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.230
I do struggle with charts and lines.

48:21.280 --> 48:24.670
I hope the jury can understand
Professor Dalgleish's theorems

48:24.720 --> 48:26.150
better than this daughter of a vicar.

48:26.200 --> 48:28.950
So... the Russian girls
currently being held

48:29.000 --> 48:31.230
against their will in your brothel,

48:31.280 --> 48:33.550
are they still pressing charges, or not?

48:33.600 --> 48:35.710
Does it merely appear to be the case

48:35.760 --> 48:39.630
that the accused is behind
this financial intrigue,

48:39.680 --> 48:42.670
or do you have actual
evidence to prove this?

48:42.720 --> 48:44.990
When did you stop doing ice?

48:46.000 --> 48:50.120
Or... or should I ask,
have you stopped doing ice?

48:51.360 --> 48:54.510
And are there cash records
to prove this payment?

48:54.560 --> 48:58.630
It was cash, obviously. No-one
pays for a hit with a direct debit.

48:58.680 --> 49:00.110
Obviously.

49:00.160 --> 49:04.960
This isn't about economics
-- it's about justice.

49:12.920 --> 49:15.550
Your Honour, with regard
to this final charge,

49:15.600 --> 49:17.870
we would first like to
call Lydia Simone Gleeson.

49:17.920 --> 49:20.230
Mr Greene.

49:20.280 --> 49:21.910
Uh, Your Honour, it would appear

49:21.960 --> 49:25.950
that there is no Lydia Simone
Gleeson on the Crown's witness list.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.510
I did contact my learned friend's

49:27.560 --> 49:28.670
senior co-counsel last night

49:28.720 --> 49:30.430
and explained the circumstances.

49:30.480 --> 49:33.910
Indeed, Mr Crown did contact
me last night, Your Honour,

49:33.960 --> 49:35.350
and I informed him

49:35.400 --> 49:36.790
that there would be no objection to

49:36.840 --> 49:38.470
Ms Gleeson's being called as a witness.

49:38.520 --> 49:42.190
Sincere and abject apologies
for failing to inform

49:42.240 --> 49:44.270
my most learned co-counsel,

49:44.320 --> 49:47.310
but he seems to have misplaced
his mobile telephone.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.230
Your Honour should also be aware
that in return for her cooperation,

49:50.280 --> 49:52.630
Ms Gleeson has been granted
immunity from prosecution.

49:52.680 --> 49:55.310
Very well. Let's get on with it, shall we?

49:55.360 --> 49:57.500
Call Lydia Simone Gleeson.

50:11.440 --> 50:13.030
You know her?

50:13.080 --> 50:14.830
Uh, yeah.

50:14.880 --> 50:16.630
She must have got married.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.590
She used to be Stein.

50:18.640 --> 50:20.310
Worked for us as a paralegal.

50:20.360 --> 50:21.830
Which one is this again, Mr Crown?

50:21.880 --> 50:22.910
Uh, the last one.

50:22.960 --> 50:25.510
23715/16.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.350
This is concerning the importation

50:27.400 --> 50:28.750
of approximately 10 kilos of cocaine,

50:28.800 --> 50:30.350
Your Honour.

50:30.400 --> 50:32.670
- Shit.
- Ah, yes.

50:32.720 --> 50:34.670
The vase.

50:34.720 --> 50:38.870
Uh, Your Honour, may I request a
five-minute adjournment, please?

50:38.920 --> 50:40.990
Very well.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.640
All rise.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.100
Why are you here?

50:56.600 --> 50:59.190
I came to say that I'm sorry.

50:59.240 --> 51:00.910
No, you didn't.

51:00.960 --> 51:02.550
And even if you did, you already have.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.830
So come on, talk to me. What's going on?

51:04.880 --> 51:06.620
Did you see Sam?

51:07.640 --> 51:10.110
I saw a Sam.

51:10.160 --> 51:13.190
Which one? What did you take?

51:13.240 --> 51:14.790
Oh!

51:14.840 --> 51:17.630
What didn't we take is
the question, Your Honour.

51:17.680 --> 51:20.880
OK, you need help.

51:22.520 --> 51:24.040
Your help.

51:26.240 --> 51:32.640
I am about... this close to not
caring what happens next, Cleave.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.360
Honestly.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.670
May I lead the witness?

51:42.720 --> 51:45.720
Anything to save His
Honour's precious time.

51:46.080 --> 51:48.110
Ms Gleeson, whilst studying law at the

51:48.160 --> 51:49.430
University of New South Wales

51:49.480 --> 51:51.870
in the years 1995 and 1996,

51:51.920 --> 51:52.910
you were employed by the firm

51:52.960 --> 51:55.430
Elliot, Moor and Masters as a paralegal,

51:55.480 --> 51:56.470
were you not?

51:56.520 --> 51:57.630
I was.

51:57.680 --> 51:59.550
I was considering a career
in the criminal law,

51:59.600 --> 52:01.430
so I was seconded, if you will,

52:01.480 --> 52:03.550
to work for Edgar Thompson.

52:03.600 --> 52:05.510
I see. And when did you leave the firm?

52:05.560 --> 52:06.710
End of '96.

52:06.760 --> 52:09.190
I wanted to travel, consider my options.

52:09.240 --> 52:13.350
I see. And these travels took you
to the African continent, did they?

52:13.400 --> 52:14.830
They did.

52:14.880 --> 52:17.390
I fell deeply in love
with a Moroccan businessman

52:17.440 --> 52:19.190
who turned out to be a drug dealer.

52:19.240 --> 52:21.430
He used me cruelly.

52:21.480 --> 52:23.790
I see. How very, very sad.

52:23.840 --> 52:25.950
I presume you, uh, craved support

52:26.000 --> 52:28.750
from family, friends, former colleagues?

52:28.800 --> 52:31.270
I did. I managed to speak
with them occasionally.

52:31.320 --> 52:34.590
Do any of these communications stand out?

52:34.640 --> 52:36.230
One does.

52:36.280 --> 52:40.190
I was asked to deliver
10 kilograms of cocaine

52:40.240 --> 52:42.150
to a certain address in Marrakesh.

52:42.200 --> 52:45.390
It was very specific.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.470
The cocaine was to be hidden in a vase.

52:47.520 --> 52:48.470
Mmm.

52:48.520 --> 52:51.310
Is the person who made that
request in this courtroom?

52:51.360 --> 52:52.430
He is.

52:52.480 --> 52:56.780
Would you please point out this
person to His Honour and the jury?

52:57.880 --> 53:00.470
Let the jury note she has
indicated Edgar Thompson.

53:00.520 --> 53:02.870
No, I haven't.

53:02.920 --> 53:04.920
it was Cleaver Greene.

53:14.880 --> 53:18.840
Oh, dear, dear, poppet.

53:33.600 --> 53:36.430
The cocaine in the vase,
you know, from Morocco.

53:36.480 --> 53:38.820
Cleaver has a vase of cocaine?

53:39.480 --> 53:40.750
Where?

53:40.800 --> 53:43.190
Feeling a little nostalgic tonight, mate.

53:43.240 --> 53:45.470
Is Thompson paying you?

53:45.520 --> 53:46.670
What if he were?

53:46.720 --> 53:48.390
So what's going to happen, Shirl?

53:48.440 --> 53:49.950
Haven't you worked it out, Cleave?

53:50.000 --> 53:51.710
Well, I think I'm for the chop.

53:51.760 --> 53:55.000
If we are going to act
on this, then that's it.

53:58.440 --> 54:01.790
You are Cal McGregor.
