<i>Previously on </i>Dynasty:

00:13.388 --> 00:15.348
There may be a job for you with the team.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.100
Takes a fool to say no
to Blake Carrington.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.811
Takes an even bigger fool to say yes,
but here I am.

00:19.894 --> 00:22.522
I assure you Fallon has zero involvement
with this team.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.066
-Soon, yeah.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.152
I've gotta run for now. I love you, Sam.

00:27.235 --> 00:30.780
I'm not sure the baby is Blake's.
I went home and made a huge mistake

00:30.864 --> 00:32.282
by sleeping with my ex-husband.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.784
-You need to tell him the truth.
-We did that.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.870
Oh, my God. Liam?

00:36.953 --> 00:37.787
You are my one.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.331
There was a time when I thought
I couldn't live without you.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.667
Now I can't stand the sight of you.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.466
<i>Wait a minute. Haven't I</i>
<i>seen you before? I know your face.</i>

00:49.549 --> 00:52.427
<i></i>

00:52.510 --> 00:53.762
<i>You're Norma Desmond.</i>

00:53.845 --> 00:56.389
<i>You used to be in silent pictures.</i>
<i>You used to be big.</i>

00:57.807 --> 00:59.517
<i>-I am big.</i>
-I am big.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.812
<i>-It's the pictures that got small.</i>
-It's the pictures that got small.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.026
-Checking up on you.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.153
You haven't answered my texts in a week.

01:11.654 --> 01:15.200
Well, I'm boycotting my phone. And people.

01:15.784 --> 01:16.993
Specifically boys.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.997
Boycotting boys? How second-grade of you.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.417
When was the last time you left your room?

01:24.501 --> 01:26.044
Or ate something other than candy?

01:26.127 --> 01:29.214
-Liam really did a number on you.

01:29.297 --> 01:32.926
He said that I was no longer the girl
he knew and loved,

01:33.009 --> 01:36.846
the sophisticated, savvy businesswoman
who wanted to start her own dynasty.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.348
Did he really say "sophisticated"?

01:39.265 --> 01:42.644
You know, it doesn't even matter.
We need to get you out of here.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.605
How about this? I'm hosting a party
tomorrow night at the club.

01:45.688 --> 01:48.233
It's game night but high-end.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.360
Aggressive competition
always cheers you up.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.402
Not this time.

01:53.404 --> 01:54.823
I just wanna be left alone.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.369
<i>Hit it.</i>

02:05.125 --> 02:08.086
So, I think Cassius Cardinal
is the best mascot option.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.379
He's small, but he's fierce.

02:09.462 --> 02:12.132
We're supposed to be presenting
a mission statement to our board.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.843
Our mission is
to entertain the crap out of our fans.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.428
I'm talking performers
and fighter jets. Hey.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.598
Find me some trained cardinals
to fly around during games.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.852
-Okay, that's enough. Go.
-We need more substantial messaging.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.311
Our star is homegrown.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.522
We focus
on creating a strong local community.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.692
I'm thinking
of a "Together we will rise" philosophy,

02:30.775 --> 02:33.194
one that speaks to the all-inclusiveness
of our team and fans.

02:33.695 --> 02:34.529
Yeah, it's heartfelt.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.489
-Exactly.
-It's heartfelt mumbo jumbo.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.325
That's not why people watch sports.
I know what's best for my team.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.995
Our team.
Then why don't we just present both?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.372
-Put it up for a board vote.
-Fine with me.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.249
-It's a waste of everyone's time.
-We'll see.

02:48.626 --> 02:51.087
I said make it dirty, not disgusting.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.255
Just start over.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.300
I just got a text from Steven

02:55.383 --> 02:57.969
saying he's extending
his South American walkabout.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.387
Did he mention

02:59.470 --> 03:02.557
That you forgot how to knock?
No, I have not spoken to Steven. Don't take this personally, Sam,
but I really don't wanna see anyone today.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.813
Including you.
So, maybe take it a little personally.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.565
I guess
Steven doesn't wanna see me either,

03:10.648 --> 03:12.233
since he keeps not coming back.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.903
Why do you think that is?

03:14.986 --> 03:17.363
I mean, is it me?
I should've never let him go to Paraguay.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.157
Or you should've gone with him.
I don't know.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.493
We know you're not cut out to be
the husband to a charitable missionary.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.162
You don't know what I'm cut out to be.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.539
You couldn't even last one night
in Paraguay.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.542
I don't know why Steven would think
you'd wanna move there.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.295
Besides, I'm sorry,
but you're just too materialistic.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.505
Me Look at all this.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.634
Too materialistic for Steven.
Thank you. Much better.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.553
So not sorry to interrupt,

03:40.637 --> 03:46.684
but the post-emo shoegaze feel-hard band
that you requested is here.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.436
-Through there.

03:48.519 --> 03:51.522
Because I would like to enjoy
all of my feelings in peace

03:51.606 --> 03:54.817
and accompanied by
an appropriately melancholic soundtrack.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.611
I'm too materialistic.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.073
I've been doing some deep thinking
and self-introspection and--

04:00.156 --> 04:00.990
Sounds painful.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.450
It was.

04:02.533 --> 04:07.080
But I realized I have to reinvent myself
to be the kind of man that Steven needs.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.749
I've been doing a lot
of reinvention research.

04:09.832 --> 04:13.753
Pretty much all the experts say
that I have to dematerialize.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.130
Cleanse myself of worldly possessions.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.174
I'm supposed to throw everything out.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.426
Except the things that truly bring me joy.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.804
I downloaded an app to get us started.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.598
-Not sure what this has to do with Steven.
-Everything.

04:26.057 --> 04:30.144
If I get aligned with Steven's thinking
and his new way of life,

04:30.228 --> 04:33.982
then... well, he'll fall in love with me
all over again when he gets back.

04:34.065 --> 04:37.443
Very sweet. I'm in. On two conditions.

04:37.860 --> 04:41.364
One: Can I please be your date
for Monica's game night tomorrow?

04:41.447 --> 04:42.865
I hate going to those things alone.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.743
You mean you hate not being
on the invite list and need my plus

04:47.161 --> 04:48.830
-Thanks.

04:48.913 --> 04:52.917
And two:
I get first dibs on your so-called trash.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.627
<i>Mi </i>trash <i>es tu </i>trash.

"You Don't Have a Choice" playing]

04:58.631 --> 05:02.593
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>For the last time</i>

05:06.306 --> 05:08.349
Play it again but sadder.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.190
What do I have to do
to get a little peace in this house?

05:16.274 --> 05:19.319
I don't know. You tell me.
It's been the same song for the last hour.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.696
You are now a human "do not disturb" sign.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.531
Go. Guard the door.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.285
Is there anything I can do?

05:29.787 --> 05:31.664
Would touching my hair
make you feel any better?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.791
I put in extra conditioner today.

05:33.875 --> 05:37.462
Sadly, I don't even think that would help.
But thank you for offering.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.298
Your stepmotherly duties are complete.
You may go.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.594
I was hoping you haven't told anyone
about my little secret.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.804
What I told you in Sun Valley.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.599
You still haven't told my father
that he may not be the baby daddy?

05:50.266 --> 05:51.601
Not cool, Cristal. I'm working on it.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.271
It's a hard thing to just say to someone.

05:55.354 --> 05:56.522
No, it's not. Look.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.524
Blake, I may be having another man's baby.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.360
It's not that hard.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.864
Then I will make him upset for no reason
by telling him.

06:04.947 --> 06:05.782
Which is why...

06:06.908 --> 06:07.742
I got this.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.119
What is that?
A time machine for undoing bad decisions? No. It's a paternity test.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.667
If it's Mark's child,
I'll confess everything.

06:16.751 --> 06:17.919
But if the baby is Blake's,

06:18.002 --> 06:21.964
then we can keep my moment of doubt
between us ladies.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.674
-Fine.
-Now...

06:25.009 --> 06:27.053
-I'm gonna need a sample.

06:27.136 --> 06:30.348
Your DNA is close enough to Blake's
to determine a match with the baby.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.101
-Mm.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.814
Don't stop playing because of this.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.149
Sadder.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.860
How much have we thrown out?

06:45.571 --> 06:47.949
-Well, that's impressive.
-That's the save pile.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.158
That's the lose pile.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.662
Well, clearly I can't dematerialize.

06:52.745 --> 06:53.830
I'm too close to it.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.667
This is exactly why
dentists don't pull out their own teeth.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.545
So, let's focus.
You and I, we've got this.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.548
-Be merciless.
-No, I can't.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.259
These things are like my children.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.678
And I'm in no place
to make a Sophie's choice

07:08.761 --> 07:09.971
between animal prints.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.308
I think we're gonna need
professional help.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.603
Seriously?

07:18.479 --> 07:21.149
-Give us five, fellas.

07:21.482 --> 07:24.235
You'll recall agreeing
to do a "day in the life" article

07:24.318 --> 07:26.529
for <i>Contemporary Metropolitan Post?</i>

07:26.612 --> 07:30.324
Yeah. I was gonna inspire millions
of little girls everywhere.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.660
I scheduled it
a few weeks after Culhane proposed.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.998
-Back when life had meaning.
-Well, apparently you forgot to cancel.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.917
-The reporter is downstairs.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.506
Send him away.
Tell him I have tuberculosis

07:45.590 --> 07:47.091
or some other contagious disease.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.342
I'll make your excuses.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.261
Wait.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.681
-Yes.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.141
Well, he can be a little snarky,

07:55.224 --> 07:57.477
so, make sure
he's buying whatever excuse you're selling

07:57.560 --> 07:59.896
and tell him we'll reschedule
for a later date.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.232
-Otherwise, he'll tweet something mean.
-Understood.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.110
Anyone seeing the state of your life
at the moment

08:06.194 --> 08:08.279
might think it was repulsive.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.489
Not me, of course.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.616
But people you care about.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.627
Mr. Desai, I regret to inform you

08:22.710 --> 08:25.338
that Ms. Carrington
is going to have to reschedule. -She's not feeling well.
-I hope it's not serious.

08:28.674 --> 08:29.884
I wish she could've told me

08:29.967 --> 08:32.929
before I spent four hours traveling here
from New York.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.847
Yes. She's very sorry.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.641
No, I completely understand.

08:37.058 --> 08:42.772
Health, physical... or mental,
comes first, of course.

08:43.856 --> 08:47.401
You're not tweeting about it, are you?
Hashtag "we'll sue for slander."

08:47.485 --> 08:48.736
What's going on, Anders?

08:49.445 --> 08:52.323
I'm just explaining to Mr. Desai here
that Fallon is--

08:52.406 --> 08:53.241
Here.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.618
Sorry to keep you waiting.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.162
All right, Mr. Desai,
I'm ready for my close-up.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.360
This profile could not come
at a better time.

09:29.443 --> 09:32.363
Now the whole world gets to see
the real Fallon Carrington

09:32.446 --> 09:33.656
and how great I'm doing.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.740
Love the enthusiasm.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.035
So, the idea is for me to see
what a typical day looks like

09:38.119 --> 09:42.206
in the life of a young
top-of-her-game billionaire like yourself.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.500
Now, will this be for print, online,
or both?

09:44.584 --> 09:47.295
I just wanna make sure as many people
see this article as possible.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.880
The stronger the material,
the more readers there will be. -So, let's see what you got.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.969
You know,
apart from a proclivity for tardiness

09:55.052 --> 09:57.805
and mysteriously vanishing illnesses.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.140
Sorry about that.

09:59.223 --> 10:02.351
I didn't realize the date, and--

10:02.435 --> 10:04.770
You mean Anders gave you the wrong one.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.357
He's had a lot on his plate.
Perhaps something was lost in translation.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.984
Isn't he from New Zealand?

10:10.067 --> 10:11.485
His accent is thick.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.155
If this is a bad time,
we could always check back in a few months

10:14.238 --> 10:18.200
and see if there's space
and interest in your profile.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.329
-I just wanna do what's best for you.
-No, no, no.

10:22.204 --> 10:26.375
The timing and my personal life
could not be more perfect right now.

10:27.126 --> 10:27.960
Fallon.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.840
I dropped by to check in on you.
I assumed you'd still be in your room.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.634
It's nice to see you finally made it out.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.886
Mother, this is Kenneth Desai
with <i>Contemporary Metro.</i>

10:36.969 --> 10:39.013
He's writing an article
about how wonderful I'm doing.

10:39.096 --> 10:42.183
Oh, well, I would love to contribute.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.685
My life is going marvelously, as well.

10:45.519 --> 10:46.854
I mean, I am very busy,

10:46.937 --> 10:49.273
but I'm sure I could eke out
four or five hours

10:49.357 --> 10:50.483
if that's what you need.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.235
What a shame. I was about to take Kenneth
on a tour of the house.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.780
Come on, get your bag.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.160
You know, it's funny.

11:02.203 --> 11:07.750
Jennings. It's an odd surname
for a woman of your background.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.794
Where is it that you said you're from?

11:12.421 --> 11:14.423
Are you writing an article, as well?

11:14.507 --> 11:18.469
Because I doubt everyone is actually
reading <i>Ex</i>

11:18.552 --> 11:22.515
I know that you don't think
that it's any of my business,

11:23.474 --> 11:24.308
but it is Blake's.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.395
-Blake knows everything he needs to know.
-You mean only what you've told him.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.189
And this whole
"international woman of mystery" thing,

11:30.856 --> 11:32.066
it isn't fooling anyone.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.069
The only fool here is you, Alexis.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.988
I have no secrets. Nothing to hide.

11:39.156 --> 11:39.990
We'll see.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.036
You know what they say.
Where there's smoke, there's a liar.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.708
This is it. Ground zero.

11:50.584 --> 11:51.627
Who's this?

11:51.710 --> 11:54.713
This is the Insta guru I found
to solve all my problems.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.717
Lady Monk.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.805
Though I prefer "mindfulness specialist"
to "guru."

12:02.888 --> 12:05.099
Kirby Anders, friend specialist.

12:05.182 --> 12:08.144
I was helping him declutter
before you arrived,

12:08.227 --> 12:10.396
and I thought we were doing fine
on our own.

12:10.479 --> 12:15.651
Actually, we were flailing,
and that's exactly why you're here.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.279
Your teachings really stood out

12:18.362 --> 12:21.031
from the sea
of Insta self-improvement coaches.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.118
That and your perfectly curated feed.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.327
Before we get started,

12:25.411 --> 12:28.581
I let all my clients pick one item
to save.

12:35.212 --> 12:36.046
Here.

12:36.380 --> 12:39.341
This is the shirt I was wearing
the last time I saw Steven.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.801
The last time we kissed.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.554
-I know it's just a shirt, but it really--

12:50.519 --> 12:51.604
What are you doing?

12:51.687 --> 12:53.105
Whoa! Not cool.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.816
No, no, no.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.487
The shirt is not Steven, Sam.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.281
Objects are not the people they represent.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.452
Wow, I... never thought about it that way.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.956
I gotta say, I...
I'm already feeling a little clearer.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.336
And why would I spy
on Mr. Carrington's fiancée for you?

13:15.419 --> 13:17.004
Because she won't tell me anything.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.840
And that's what friends like us do
for one another.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.718
Fine. If you won't do it,

13:22.801 --> 13:27.723
I'll just have to show Blake
how utterly firable you are.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.936
Since when is driving a car
and having a girlfriend a crime?

13:32.019 --> 13:34.480
Well, when you're joyriding
in Blake's Rolls-Royce

13:34.563 --> 13:38.025
and Joy, the housemaid, is riding you.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.903
I would imagine that she'll be fired,
as well,

13:40.986 --> 13:44.073
when... Blake sees these.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.241
That would be such a shame.

13:46.283 --> 13:49.203
-Well, you're a gardener, Tony.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.205
I want you to do some digging.

13:54.250 --> 13:58.837
Which leads us to
my third-favorite painting in the house.

13:58.921 --> 14:02.550
I've seen the grounds, the cellar,
your butler's duck-decoy collection,

14:02.633 --> 14:05.469
but I have yet to see
the real top-of-her-game Fallon

14:05.553 --> 14:06.470
that you promised.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.181
So, why do I get the feeling
you're hiding something?

14:09.265 --> 14:10.724
I'm not. I mean...

14:11.809 --> 14:13.310
feel free to ask me anything.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.981
Well, since this article was also
supposed to be about a day in the life

14:17.064 --> 14:20.818
of a new bride, I have to ask,
how have you handled the breakup?

14:21.235 --> 14:22.111
Wonderfully.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.155
I mean, as well as could be expected.

14:25.656 --> 14:29.910
Yes, the relationship did not work out,
but it ended amicably.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.205
-And it's as simple and boring as that.
-Good for you.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.584
I couldn't write for two months
after my last breakup.

14:36.667 --> 14:40.296
Just buried myself in tissues and vodka.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.631
I can see how that would be hard for you.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.342
So, you don't mind
if I call Michael Culhane, do you?

14:45.426 --> 14:48.262
-Especially since things are so amicable.
-Of course not.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.140
But you don't even have to call him,

14:51.223 --> 14:54.685
because he and I
actually have dinner plans tonight,

14:54.768 --> 14:55.853
and you're welcome to join.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.980
-Well, that's perfect.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.440
Okay. Well, I...

15:00.107 --> 15:01.775
If you'll excuse me a moment,

15:01.859 --> 15:04.069
I need to go
to my solo afternoon meditation.

15:04.153 --> 15:04.987
Just like Oprah.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.323
Oh, write that down.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.796
Joy. Could you mail this
for me right away?

15:23.213 --> 15:24.924
Please don't mention it to anyone.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.425
-Of course.
-Thank you.

15:34.642 --> 15:39.438
Hey, Joy, I'm headed to the post office.
You want me to take that for you?

15:39.521 --> 15:41.315
Actually, that would be super helpful.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.277
Here.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.285
Well, this will work.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.331
Seems like our little angel
has been spreading her wings

15:57.414 --> 16:00.125
in more than one bed, hasn't she?

16:05.255 --> 16:06.840
My name is Sammy Jo Carrington,

16:07.383 --> 16:10.970
and I am ready to free myself
from the energy of material things

16:11.387 --> 16:14.473
in order to create a better version of me.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.060
-Hi, Steven.
-And to Instagram it goes.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.479
You are doing so wonderfully, Sam.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.940
Now all you have to do
to be who you want to be

16:23.148 --> 16:25.567
is to let yourself feel free.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.195
Now it's detox time.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.490
" playing]

16:33.283 --> 16:34.326
Bye.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.746
Yes. I did it.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.625
This and this and this.

16:42.918 --> 16:43.794
Yes.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.925
Oh, no. This is staying. It's Gucci.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.594
We're not just making space
for the new Sam.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.596
We're also providing for others
who are in need.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.639
Can't argue with that.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.851
This is insane.

16:58.934 --> 17:02.396
You barely know this Insta crank,
and you're gonna throw everything away?

17:02.479 --> 17:03.814
Kirby, I know you're distrustful,

17:03.897 --> 17:07.067
but negative thoughts lead
to negative results.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.570
And look at all the progress
that Sam is making.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.405
Isn't that what's really important?

17:12.114 --> 17:13.657
You weren't kidding.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.618
I think this merits a selfie
with my sensei.

17:22.958 --> 17:23.792
Kirby.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.546
-I was saving it.

17:27.629 --> 17:30.883
For when you eventually remember
that you can't live without Gucci.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.720
Negative thoughts, negative results.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.556
Kirby, maybe you need to replenish,
come back later.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.642
Try a banana.
Potassium is a real lifesaver.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.231
All we have to do is switch out
the original paternity sample

17:46.690 --> 17:48.984
with a non-Carrington sample

17:49.068 --> 17:51.820
so the tests come back as not a match.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.573
And then we make sure
that Blake see the results

17:54.656 --> 17:58.202
confirming that the baby's not his,
and bye-bye, Cristal.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.832
Non-Carrington DNA coming right up.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.251
Yeah.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.008
Good dog. Good dog.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.303
Dinner. Dinner was the emergency?

18:16.386 --> 18:19.973
I'm picking up on a hostile vibe.
If we could take it down a notch.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.226
-You 911'ed me.
-Because it is an emergency.

18:22.309 --> 18:25.229
The writer does not have a story,
so, he zeroed in on our relationship.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.606
He's gonna keep looking for stuff
unless we throw him off.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.025
We have plenty of skeletons
that need to stay buried,

18:30.109 --> 18:31.401
so, I needed to warn you.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.113
It was not just a 911 for me.
It was a 911 for us.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.240
Fallon, there is no us.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.493
Not anymore.
I'm no longer at your beck and call.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.620
I can't drop everything to save,
what, your vanity?

18:41.703 --> 18:43.497
My vanity. That's very funny.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.040
Because wasn't it your vanity

18:45.124 --> 18:47.459
that made you wanna go work
for that evil woman

18:47.543 --> 18:49.586
so you could feel all big and all macho?

18:49.670 --> 18:51.630
As a matter of fact, you owe me

18:51.713 --> 18:54.258
for destroying our relationship
after I saved your ass.

18:54.675 --> 18:55.592
Owe you?

18:56.176 --> 18:59.555
Everything I did was to protect you.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.890
To close the Van Kirk deal.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.392
To save you from Ada.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.311
All you've ever done was treat me
like a little plaything

19:06.395 --> 19:08.105
in your never-ending psycho drama.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.732
-You put yourself in that position.
-Not anymore.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.442
I don't know what happened to you,

19:12.526 --> 19:14.778
but you're not the Fallon Carrington
that I used to love.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.039
So, I was wrong.
There's definitely a story worth telling.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.209
Less "Fallon Carrington,
billions and brains,"

19:30.002 --> 19:32.713
more "Fallon Carrington,
billion-dollar mess."

19:33.338 --> 19:37.843
We need to think of the game
as more a show than a sporting event.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.762
-People wanna be entertained.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.098
You're not thinking big enough.
Every team plays a game.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.809
But how many of them, I don't know,
introduce their lineup

19:45.893 --> 19:48.812
by having them skydive into the stadium?

19:48.896 --> 19:51.899
-Probably none. That's a huge liability.
-Bells and whistles are great,

19:51.982 --> 19:55.152
but we want our mission statement
to be deeper, more meaningful.

19:55.235 --> 19:58.238
Exactly. And MLS LAFC's motto
is "Shoulder to shoulder."

19:58.780 --> 19:59.990
What's this team stand for?

20:03.452 --> 20:07.289
Great point. Which is why I'm suggesting
that our team's motto be

20:07.748 --> 20:09.124
"Together we will rise."

20:10.083 --> 20:13.587
It's inclusive of the team and fans
but also the community as a whole.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.632
We can build a great ad campaign,
even get local schools involved.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.884
Sounds great. You should've led with that.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.844
We can discuss it more
at our next meeting.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.474
Wait. You're leaving?

20:26.183 --> 20:29.061
I thought we were having dinner.
I'm sorry Michael couldn't make it.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.479
He had a family emergency.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.565
Yes. It definitely sounded
like some kind of emergency.

20:34.107 --> 20:36.902
What do you mean, sounded like?
I'm not sure what you thought you heard.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.695
No, I didn't hear anything, but...

20:39.905 --> 20:41.740
This is gonna be a beautiful piece.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.284
I think
that you're gonna be really surprised.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.202
In a good way.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.705
We're done?
-Let's just say I have everything I need.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.125
Wait. Wait. Um...

20:52.709 --> 20:55.420
I was holding back.
And I'm sorry for burying the lede.

20:55.504 --> 20:59.007
But I told you I was working
on something big, business-wise,

20:59.091 --> 21:01.218
so, at least give me a chance to show you.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.179
You know, it's a little late,
and I'm not hungry.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.391
I gorged myself
on this tiny charcuterie plate.

21:07.557 --> 21:10.269
The launch party for my new company
is tomorrow night.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.520
How many chances do you get

21:11.603 --> 21:14.106
to profile Jobs and Wozniak
before their Apple?

21:14.523 --> 21:16.942
It's one night. A party at Club Colby.

21:17.025 --> 21:17.859
And I promise,

21:17.943 --> 21:20.279
this is the groundbreaking,
aspirational angle

21:20.362 --> 21:22.114
worthy of your skills as a journalist.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.031
Okay.

21:23.740 --> 21:27.286
I could stay another day.
But only 'cause I love a good party.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.253
Monica, you were right.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.463
I will definitely be coming to game night.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.300
But I've got a different game to play.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.179
Hey, guys, it's me.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.850
I'm just here eating sustainably
with food I foraged.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.228
This is watercress and burdock.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.815
Came right out of the ground.
You just steam it, salt and pepper it.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.442
Voilà.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.237
That must taste like dirt.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.614
Lady Monk gave me a new outlook.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.451
Food is just fuel.
It doesn't need to be anything more.

22:08.076 --> 22:08.910
I get it.

22:08.994 --> 22:12.039
But I think actual fuel might taste better
than that.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.333
Same with clothes.
I don't need anything more

22:14.416 --> 22:18.712
than this organic fair-trade
zero-carbon-footprint tunic.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.507
Maybe you should wear it tonight.
I'll try and coordinate.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.093
I forgot to tell you.
I can't go with you to game night.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.929
-I'm taking Lady Monk as my plus-one.
Why?

22:28.013 --> 22:31.725
I wanna introduce her to new clients.
She's made such a difference in my life.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.770
Besides, think of how impressed
Steven will be

22:34.853 --> 22:37.481
when he hears how I've committed
to this lifestyle.

22:37.981 --> 22:40.400
I'm starting to worry
about her influence on you.

22:40.484 --> 22:44.237
You don't need to.
This is no weirder than a juice cleanse

22:44.321 --> 22:46.615
or Gwyneth steaming her vagina.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.617
First of all, huge Gwyneth fan.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.453
Second of all,
I am not one to slam wackadoodle beliefs,

22:51.536 --> 22:53.163
but this woman seems super dodgy.

22:53.997 --> 22:55.707
What do you really know about her?

22:55.791 --> 22:58.210
I know that I am happier
than I've been in weeks.

22:58.418 --> 23:01.254
Actually, Lady Monk warned me
that this might happen,

23:01.463 --> 23:04.966
that you may try to stop me
from being my best self.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.134
She warned you about me?

23:06.218 --> 23:07.928
-Mm-hm.
-Brilliant.

23:08.637 --> 23:12.641
I am just trying to prevent
that culture-appropriating fake healer

23:12.724 --> 23:13.975
from taking advantage of you.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.978
She said you're angry because you're not
the center of attention.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.397
And I think she's right. That's just sad.

23:20.857 --> 23:23.276
So, <i>namaste.</i>

23:23.860 --> 23:25.112
You did what?

23:26.279 --> 23:30.242
I said to replace the sample
with non-Carrington DNA, not dog DNA.

23:30.325 --> 23:33.328
I thought you would appreciate
that I went above and beyond.

23:33.411 --> 23:36.665
There is no way the daddy DNA
is gonna match the baby's.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.126
Because it won't match any human DNA.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.420
Okay, now the lab is gonna ask
for more samples

23:42.504 --> 23:44.297
so that they can rerun the tests.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.844
There's gotta be a way to save this.
I need you to keep trailing Cristal

23:48.927 --> 23:52.305
and see if you can't find out
who that baby daddy could be.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.515
Aside from Blake.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.309
Okay, run along. Get going.

24:02.732 --> 24:04.609
What happened
to the giant battleships?

24:07.237 --> 24:10.782
I didn't realize by "cohosting,"
you meant taking over my game night.

24:11.241 --> 24:15.537
Well... I'm not taking it over.
I'm just making it larger-than-life.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.581
Though I couldn't get jumbo Candy Land.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.833
I was gonna have people dress up
as the characters.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.585
I always had a thing
for Princess Frostine.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.752
She is cute.

24:23.378 --> 24:26.047
Wait. So, all of this is for a reporter?

24:26.131 --> 24:29.342
No. Well, technically, yes.
I just need him to write an article

24:29.426 --> 24:31.386
that Liam can read
to see how great I'm doing.

24:31.469 --> 24:34.139
Look, you are the one
who said you're boycotting boys.

24:34.222 --> 24:37.392
I need to make Liam see
that he has no effect on me

24:37.475 --> 24:40.228
and he is missing out
on the best Fallon Carrington.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.521
One other thing to know:

24:41.605 --> 24:44.232
Tonight is also the launch party
for my new business.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.319
-You don't have a new business.
-Not yet. The night is young.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.905
All I have to do is find someone here
with a great idea,

24:49.988 --> 24:52.449
convince them to pretend
I've always been their partner,

24:52.532 --> 24:53.950
and let Kenneth do the rest.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.327
Sounds like a foolproof plan.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.205
I don't need your sarcasm, Monica.
I need your help.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.123
Please. And a miracle.

25:02.417 --> 25:06.379
Speaking of miracles,
the CEO of Spartan Force is coming.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.424
This is shaping up
to be the best fake launch party yet.

25:09.507 --> 25:11.176
Thank you for letting me do this.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.471
As if I had a choice.

25:14.554 --> 25:17.140
Tell me you're not trying
to pilfer another credit card.

25:17.474 --> 25:20.310
I'm not pilfering anything,
whatever that means.

25:20.393 --> 25:23.772
-I'm trying to get Sam's stuff back.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.524
To an Insta guru
who says they're going to charity,

25:26.608 --> 25:27.943
but I highly doubt that.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.028
Why do you doubt her? Sam seems happy.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.322
I cross-referenced Lady Monk's feed
with some other feeds.

25:32.405 --> 25:33.865
Too many things don't add up.

25:33.949 --> 25:37.160
-I already handled it.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.996
His tablet he gave away is still on,
and I pinged it.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.624
It's... wherever that is.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.168
I can wait to get used
at the next meeting.

25:45.252 --> 25:48.421
-I didn't use you. I used your idea.
-Without mentioning where you got it.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.382
Hold on. Is that what this is about?

25:50.465 --> 25:53.051
Credit and ego?
I didn't realize it was important to you.

25:53.134 --> 25:56.429
I guess I should've seen it coming,
given the games you played to get here.

25:56.513 --> 25:59.182
I've learned those filthy games
from a master: you.

25:59.724 --> 26:02.310
I've also learned how to match you,
so, watch out.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.396
As far as ego,
it's hard to tell whose is bigger:

26:04.479 --> 26:05.480
yours or your daughter's.

26:05.563 --> 26:07.857
-Don't make this personal.
-It already is.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.527
I've dealt with the two of you using me
for years.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.446
My days as a Carrington pawn are over.

26:13.530 --> 26:14.447
So, what?

26:16.157 --> 26:17.784
-No.

26:18.576 --> 26:19.995
But I am done with Fallon.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.914
And I'm done with you treating me
like I'm still your driver.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.709
You're blowing this out of proportion.
It's just business.

26:25.792 --> 26:26.626
Exactly.

26:27.294 --> 26:30.005
And this is my opportunity
to make something of myself.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.883
And I'm not letting you get in the way.
So, if you want my expertise,

26:33.967 --> 26:36.177
you're gonna need to accept
that we're partners.

26:40.598 --> 26:41.891
-That's right.
-I know.

26:43.226 --> 26:44.185
Easy.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.897
Hey, welcome to the launch
of Fallon Unlimited.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.066
Yeah, you really went all out here.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.986
So, what was the thinking
behind game night?

26:53.069 --> 26:55.071
Is this related to your new company?

26:55.155 --> 26:59.451
Well, once I reveal my concept to you
and introduce you to my business partner,

26:59.534 --> 27:00.827
I think it'll all come together.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.788
Let's get you a drink. Or several.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.999
Thank you so much for inviting me, Sam.

27:06.082 --> 27:08.668
This gives me a chance to fund-raise
for my charity,

27:08.752 --> 27:10.378
Lady Monk's Mindful Giving,

27:10.462 --> 27:13.298
and to spread my ideas to the uninitiated.

27:13.381 --> 27:17.552
I think the tunics might be
a little too biblical for this crowd.

27:17.635 --> 27:21.431
Let's focus on finding people
who are like-minded and open-minded.

27:22.098 --> 27:24.309
Like her. Isn't that your sister

27:25.060 --> 27:27.228
Yeah, but that is not a mind
you wanna open.

27:27.645 --> 27:28.480
Trust me.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.441
Why don't we try something new
and split up?

27:31.524 --> 27:33.526
Double our reach, double our teach.

27:34.527 --> 27:35.362
All right.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.198
Well, I won't let you down.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.427
Carrington residence.

28:01.262 --> 28:03.598
No, I'm not interested
in a new cable company.

28:06.267 --> 28:07.352
Carrington residence.

28:10.230 --> 28:13.024
Oh, I believe we're already given
quite generously.

28:19.864 --> 28:20.949
Carrington residence.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.535
<i>This is Pacific North Bio Lab in Seattle.</i>

28:23.618 --> 28:25.370
<i>I'm calling for Cristal Jennings.</i>

28:26.162 --> 28:27.038
Please hold.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.294
Well, hello there. This is Cristal.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.922
<i>Yes. Mrs. Jennings, we wanted to let know</i>

28:36.005 --> 28:38.299
<i>that you need to resubmit</i>
<i>your paternity test.</i>

28:38.383 --> 28:40.760
<i>Unfortunately, the sample</i>
<i>was contaminated.</i>

28:40.969 --> 28:42.720
Oh! How awful.

28:43.346 --> 28:47.308
Well, I'm feeling a little nauseous
at the moment.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.519
You know, it's my first trimester.

28:50.061 --> 28:53.898
Well, would y'all mind
if I just transferred you to my husband?

28:54.774 --> 28:57.026
Well, my fiancé. He's almost my husband.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.112
All right. One moment, please.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.916
The new maid
accidentally handed me the phone,

29:12.000 --> 29:12.876
but it's for Cristal.

29:13.835 --> 29:16.212
Something about tests for the baby?

29:24.053 --> 29:24.888
This is Blake.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.223
What do you mean, another sample?
For what?

29:28.767 --> 29:31.269
A paternity test? I'm the father.
Why would she...?

29:38.359 --> 29:39.319
Son of a bitch.

29:46.534 --> 29:49.537
It's sort of a hybrid tech-analog idea.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.539
My favorite kind.
Are you looking for funding?

29:51.623 --> 29:55.376
It does involve a version of S and M
using 4-D technology.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.128
Because I don't have any funding.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.632
No.

30:00.715 --> 30:02.342
I've been here for over an hour,

30:02.425 --> 30:05.094
and you still haven't told me
the groundbreaking idea

30:05.178 --> 30:08.223
that's gonna relaunch Fallon Carrington
to the world.

30:09.015 --> 30:11.184
-Unless there isn't one.
-Oh, there is one.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.478
Why else would I go
through all this trouble?

30:15.271 --> 30:17.565
Oh, let me introduce you to Monica.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.901
She is the club owner.
Been friends since we were kids.

30:19.984 --> 30:23.655
Monica Colby, this is Kenneth Desai,
the reporter I was telling you about.

30:23.738 --> 30:24.697
You throw a great party.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.242
Really, it's all Fallon.
This is her launch.

30:27.325 --> 30:30.203
Wait till you hear about her company.
It's gonna blow your mind.

30:30.286 --> 30:33.039
-It's really a--
-Go back to work now, Monica. Okay.

30:33.122 --> 30:36.251
You know, Monica and I
started a record label together.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.545
-Uh...

30:38.628 --> 30:41.005
-Fallon.

30:41.089 --> 30:44.342
Can you help me?
A little in-joke between us girls.

30:44.425 --> 30:47.762
Lady Monk, mindfulness specialist
with a million Insta followers.

30:48.221 --> 30:50.348
Fallon and I are collabing. Partners.

30:50.431 --> 30:53.601
-Kenneth Desai, <i>Contemporary Metro.</i>

30:53.685 --> 30:57.438
Excuse me, but Kenneth is interviewing me,
Lady Granola.

30:57.522 --> 30:58.565
-Come on.
-Hold on.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.693
I'm glad to finally meet Fallon's partner.

31:01.985 --> 31:05.071
I've been dying to hear
about this brilliant new company idea.

31:06.072 --> 31:09.534
You threw everything away and now
you're, what, hunting and gathering?

31:09.617 --> 31:10.702
No more gathering.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.371
Just hunting for inner peace.

31:13.454 --> 31:15.081
This has been a real trip,

31:15.164 --> 31:18.209
but I just contributed
to Steven's foundation at the gala.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.378
My checkbook is all worn out.

31:21.337 --> 31:22.171
Sorry.

31:22.589 --> 31:23.756
Namaste.

31:34.434 --> 31:37.395
Are you gonna join me in bed,
or just stare like a stalker?

31:38.021 --> 31:39.647
You just looked so serene.

31:40.189 --> 31:41.941
Just so serene.

31:43.610 --> 31:46.112
For someone who doesn't know
whose baby they're carrying.

31:47.196 --> 31:48.948
-The lab called.

31:49.824 --> 31:52.285
-About your paternity test.
-My God.

31:52.368 --> 31:55.121
The results were contaminated.
They needed another sample.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.789
-Blake.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.292
Or were you gonna let me
carry another man's baby like Alexis?

31:59.375 --> 32:02.211
I was going to tell you
if the baby wasn't yours.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.212
But I think--

32:04.839 --> 32:07.008
I feel in my heart it is yours.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.802
It happened before I thought
you and I could be together.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.138
I went back to Arizona. I saw my ex--

32:12.221 --> 32:15.016
-My ex-husband.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.100
Mark Jennings.

32:17.852 --> 32:19.187
We got married very young.

32:19.687 --> 32:22.565
My parents partially owned a soccer team.
He was a player.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.860
But they had a falling-out
when he refused to throw a game for them.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.906
They destroyed his career.
They would stop at nothing to ruin him.

32:29.989 --> 32:32.867
It became too dangerous to be together.
We had to end it.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.954
You had to?
So, you still have feelings for him?

32:36.037 --> 32:38.706
No. It was a long time ago.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.376
-Clearly not that long ago.
-Blake, last time was a mistake.

32:41.459 --> 32:44.337
I came back here
and I completely fell for you.

32:44.837 --> 32:47.674
You have to believe me. I love you.

32:49.717 --> 32:50.802
Please say something.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.221
Anything.

32:58.434 --> 33:01.729
This is fascinating. You were mentioning
something about a book?

33:04.440 --> 33:08.820
You caught me. Lady Monk's brand
is the company I've been hinting about.

33:08.903 --> 33:11.072
And, yes, the book is gonna be huge.

33:11.155 --> 33:14.158
We have a multi-platform attack scheduled

33:14.242 --> 33:16.619
so that we can take it international,
as well.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.579
We've been working on it for,
what, months?

33:18.663 --> 33:21.124
We want to feature my philosophy
and methods

33:21.207 --> 33:24.961
so that people can practice
a mindful detachment at home.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.337
I'm also working on an app.

33:27.547 --> 33:31.968
"Fallon Carrington:
from heiress to lifestyle savant."

33:32.510 --> 33:37.015
It's really surprising and interesting.
Not exactly the next logical step.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.100
"Logic can take you from A to B.

33:39.600 --> 33:43.146
But the imagination
can take you everywhere." Einstein.

33:43.229 --> 33:45.565
I'm curious about your initial investment
in the project.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.693
-We haven't really--
-Several million. With a back end.

33:49.610 --> 33:53.031
We are still working out the details,
but, you know,

33:53.489 --> 33:58.953
details are just the... grains of sand
on the beach of life.

33:59.787 --> 34:02.457
This is definitely an unexpected turn
for the article.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.168
I wanna run this new angle by my editor.

34:05.251 --> 34:06.669
-Yeah.

34:07.879 --> 34:11.466
I don't know who you are,
but thank you very much for playing along.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.135
-We need to talk about this more.
-There you are.

34:15.094 --> 34:20.183
I didn't have any luck trying to find
new clients or fund-raising. Sorry.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.851
But I have an idea.

34:22.477 --> 34:24.771
I can give you money
from the Steven Carrington Foundation

34:24.854 --> 34:26.689
so you can keep helping people.

34:27.273 --> 34:30.735
I'm sorry.
Sam, we are discussing business,

34:30.818 --> 34:33.613
so, please take your toga party elsewhere.

34:33.696 --> 34:35.823
This is my guru. You can find your own.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.743
-First of all, mindfulness specialist.
-Yeah.

34:39.077 --> 34:43.039
And secondly, I can accept
both of your investments and donations.

34:43.122 --> 34:45.249
One Carrington's not enough?
Trying to bag a second?

34:45.333 --> 34:48.669
Kirby, you are making no sense.
This is no time for your crazy.

34:48.753 --> 34:49.837
Right. I'm sorry.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.298
-Lady Monk is a con artist.
-You're kidding.

34:52.381 --> 34:53.883
-Jealousy is so ugly

34:53.966 --> 34:56.594
-on such a beautiful face.
-I tracked your stuff to a warehouse.

34:56.677 --> 34:59.889
It's all boxed up and ready to be shipped
to a consignment store.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.766
This is what she does.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.851
She rips people off
and has someone sell it online.

35:03.935 --> 35:04.769
It's all here.

35:04.852 --> 35:07.980
The proceeds from all of those sales
are going to charities.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.816
UNICEF, the Red Cross, all of them.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.860
Right. I'm sure once my father
finishes tracking your money trail,

35:13.194 --> 35:16.531
we'll find that those proceeds go directly
into your burlap pocket.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.032
Oh, my God.

35:18.116 --> 35:21.577
You convinced me
to wear this ugly-ass outfit

35:21.661 --> 35:23.162
and to eat grass.

35:23.746 --> 35:27.542
-I was about to give you millions.
-No, Sam. Steven would be so proud of--

35:27.625 --> 35:30.002
-Don't you dare bring him up.
-This is how she gets people.

35:30.086 --> 35:33.381
When they're at their most vulnerable,
which is clearly you two.

35:33.464 --> 35:35.967
I mean, you miss your husband.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.928
And you have barely left your room

35:39.011 --> 35:43.599
ever since Liam rejected you
like a sad, moldy loaf of bread.

35:43.683 --> 35:46.102
Well, that was a little harsh. But true.

35:46.185 --> 35:48.729
Look, I just met this crackpot
five minutes ago.

35:49.605 --> 35:52.733
I was so insecure that it was easier
to let you convince me

35:52.817 --> 35:55.069
that I was the problem, but I'm not.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.655
I mean, sure,
I should be less materialistic,

35:57.738 --> 35:59.282
but I'm amazing,

36:00.032 --> 36:03.494
even if I'm work in progress,
and Steven will realize that or not.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.955
You even made me question
my fashion sense.

36:06.038 --> 36:09.584
Security. Please get
this pathetic Insta grifter out of here.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.669
You're calling me pathetic? Look around.

36:11.752 --> 36:14.714
You faked an entire party
to impress one reporter?

36:15.756 --> 36:16.924
Takes a fraud to know a fraud.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.177
You're the biggest one of them all,
Fallon Carrington.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.094
You're done.

36:21.554 --> 36:24.223
Like I said, I do love a good party.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.684
And I think I have everything I need.

36:27.435 --> 36:30.563
Keep an eye out for the article.
It's gonna be a doozy.

36:38.613 --> 36:43.576
-I just wanted to come by to--
-Just let me say what needs to be said.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.579
Sorry I doubted you, Kirby.

36:46.913 --> 36:51.792
I was just drowning in self-doubt
and grasping at figurative straws when...

36:53.044 --> 36:57.215
Well, when the real emotional lifeline
I needed was here next to me...

36:58.382 --> 36:59.300
the whole time.

37:00.927 --> 37:01.928
You're the lifeline.

37:03.763 --> 37:05.431
No one's ever said that about me.

37:06.140 --> 37:09.727
I've always been the albatross
or dead weight.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.103
Or crazy Kirby.

37:11.729 --> 37:14.482
But before I get weird and weepy,
have you checked your Instagram?

37:14.857 --> 37:18.819
No. And the next time I check it
will be the last time I check it.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.030
-I'm deleting my account.
-You shouldn't.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.157
Your Instagram is on fire.

37:24.617 --> 37:27.203
Oh, my God. How did this happen?

37:27.662 --> 37:28.704
When I got to the club,

37:28.788 --> 37:31.165
I put my phone on the bar
to record Lady Shady's takedown.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.167
I wanted to expose her.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.671
But then you started exposing yourself
in a way that felt...

37:38.089 --> 37:40.091
more important and way cooler.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.051
So, I posted it.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.762
Now your hashtag-"love thyself" message
is viral.

37:44.971 --> 37:45.888
Or I look insane.

37:45.972 --> 37:49.392
A hundred thousand views
and 50,000 new followers beg to differ.

37:52.353 --> 37:54.897
-Thank you for knocking.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.734
Well, I know last night
was a roller coaster.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.861
More like a bungee jump without a bungee.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.698
That's kind of an ominous visual.
Are you okay?

38:03.781 --> 38:07.660
If there's one thing I know for sure,
it is that I am not okay.

38:08.035 --> 38:12.581
You know, I spent a week in bed
because of a guy, which is pathetic.

38:13.457 --> 38:14.959
My business judgment is so off

38:15.042 --> 38:18.337
that I tried to make a deal
with a woman who was clearly a fraud--

38:18.421 --> 38:19.755
Hey, I fell for her too.

38:20.214 --> 38:21.966
-Yeah, that doesn't really help me.
-Same.

38:22.049 --> 38:25.219
I've been talking about doing all
these things and haven't done any of them.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.306
Now there's gonna be this article
telling the world what a mess I am.

38:28.597 --> 38:30.850
So... things are good.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.437
-Well, crazily,

38:34.520 --> 38:37.732
my accidental self-love mantra
is trending.

38:38.691 --> 38:43.195
I never knew I could help other people
just by telling it like it is.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.656
-I think I have to.

38:45.740 --> 38:50.411
I have 421,489 followers.

38:50.494 --> 38:52.538
And three sponsors
have already sent me tunics.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.623
-I would run from those.
-Never again.

38:55.791 --> 38:58.377
Well, glad to see
you've got it all figured out.

38:58.919 --> 39:03.174
And to focus on the positive, I am going
to start posting daily affirmations.

39:03.257 --> 39:05.718
And I want the first one
to be just for you.

39:06.469 --> 39:10.139
You may be in a dark place right now,
but the light will come.

39:11.474 --> 39:12.600
You just need to find it.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.941
-There she is.

39:21.692 --> 39:24.779
Knew you'd be back on top,
back in fighting shape in no time.

39:25.404 --> 39:26.280
Actually, I'm not.

39:26.822 --> 39:29.992
I am not on top,
and I am definitely not in good shape.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.495
Everyone was right about me.

39:36.415 --> 39:37.625
I need your help, Daddy.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.756
-Blake, I--
-Before you say anything,

39:44.298 --> 39:46.926
I just wanna tell you
I'm sorry I stormed out before.

39:47.009 --> 39:48.552
-I needed space.
-I understand.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.638
I thought I could wrap my head
around the possibility

39:50.721 --> 39:51.847
that baby might not be mine.

39:54.016 --> 39:54.850
But...

39:57.603 --> 40:00.731
I saw the pain Steven felt
about his confused parentage.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.861
On top of that, you kept this a secret.

40:08.447 --> 40:09.949
And how can I believe you now?

40:10.825 --> 40:14.036
-You say that Mark is out of your life--
-I'm telling the truth.

40:15.162 --> 40:17.832
There is no Mark Jennings in my heart.

40:19.875 --> 40:22.962
But I can only say it so many times
in so many ways.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.641
I found out that some guy
named Mark Jennings

40:35.724 --> 40:36.934
could be the baby daddy.

40:37.017 --> 40:39.645
-I'm guessing it's her ex-husband.
-There's more.

40:39.728 --> 40:42.940
It wasn't easy,
but I've got friends in all places.

40:43.023 --> 40:45.109
I talked to my buddy who knows the barber

40:45.192 --> 40:48.612
who cuts the hair of a chef that works
at the mayor's favorite restaurant,

40:48.696 --> 40:49.655
and he told me--

40:49.738 --> 40:50.906
Can you get to the point?

40:51.115 --> 40:54.160
You really know how to suck the fun
out of big reveals.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.330
Mark Jennings' last contact.

41:02.918 --> 41:03.752
Please leave.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.066
Hello. Is this Mark?

41:26.859 --> 41:29.862
I was thinking about what you said
yesterday, and I agree.

41:30.779 --> 41:33.824
Partners should work together
and respect one another.

41:33.908 --> 41:36.619
-I'm glad to hear you say that.
-But let me remind you,

41:36.702 --> 41:39.455
you had one good move
that got you this job,

41:39.538 --> 41:43.334
so, I figure I owe you one of my own
before we get back to even again.

41:43.417 --> 41:45.711
-You're in the big leagues now.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.090
-Oh, hell, no.
-Oh, hell, no.
