00:00.060 --> 00:01.453
<i>Previously on</i> Good Witch:

00:01.478 --> 00:03.400
It's clear you don't want
to have a baby.

00:03.425 --> 00:05.920
- Been great working for you.
- You're quitting?!

00:06.027 --> 00:07.727
Will you please teach me how to drive?

00:07.779 --> 00:09.779
- John!
- Can I come in?

00:09.865 --> 00:12.365
Linda told me about your
ex- boyfriend moving to town.

00:12.401 --> 00:14.082
Is there someone else?

00:19.997 --> 00:22.742
<i>- You were fearless.
- Oh no, I wasn't.</i>

00:22.744 --> 00:24.878
An armed militia stops you
at the border; it's kind

00:24.913 --> 00:27.664
of a big deal! And you, you're
the reason we got through.

00:27.716 --> 00:30.383
- Hey, Mom!
- Oh, hi!

00:30.419 --> 00:33.153
- Hi!
- Sam, Grace, this is John;

00:33.188 --> 00:35.889
- he's an old friend.
- (both): Nice to meet you.

00:35.924 --> 00:38.497
- (Grace and John): Hi!
- So, how's the driving lesson?

00:38.532 --> 00:41.261
- Oh, I killed it, right?
- Well, you are too modest.

00:41.313 --> 00:43.807
She's becoming quite a parallel parker.

00:45.187 --> 00:46.433
Oh yeah... well, sit, both of you.

00:46.435 --> 00:49.234
Oh, I would love to but
pre-calc is calling my name.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.271
- It was nice to meet you, though.
- You too, Grace.

00:51.323 --> 00:53.990
- Thanks, Sam.
- Bye.

00:54.025 --> 00:57.243
- Would you like a glass of wine?
- Oh, I don't wanna interrupt.

00:57.279 --> 00:59.292
I was just about
to ask Cassie to authenticate

00:59.317 --> 01:02.332
- a Chinese artifact for me.
- Ming or Tang?

01:03.015 --> 01:04.343
That's what I need you for.

01:04.953 --> 01:07.170
- You authenticate art?
- Um, I studied

01:07.205 --> 01:09.122
art history in college;
it's just a hobby.

01:09.124 --> 01:11.674
She plays a mean game of
Scrabble in Farsi.

01:12.317 --> 01:14.594
- Farsi?
- Yeah, Cassie speaks

01:14.629 --> 01:16.629
- five languages..?
- Uh, six!

01:16.681 --> 01:19.040
Six. I stand corrected.

01:19.634 --> 01:22.802
Listen, I have to get back
to a faculty thing, so...

01:22.804 --> 01:26.105
- Just bring it by the shop.
- Thanks, I will.

01:26.141 --> 01:28.308
- Nice to meet you, Sam.
- Nice to meet you.

01:28.310 --> 01:30.944
Bye. Hm!

01:31.614 --> 01:32.861
What?

01:32.898 --> 01:34.392
Well, this has been educational!

01:35.338 --> 01:38.318
- Authenticating art?
- Oh well, it's my past.

01:38.320 --> 01:40.537
Yeah, but I think the good archeologist

01:40.572 --> 01:43.490
- is trying to unearth it.
- Mm-hm.

01:44.409 --> 01:46.960

Ryan.

02:22.703 --> 02:23.870
Cassie Nightingale.

02:24.518 --> 02:26.699
- You're back!
- Yeah,

02:26.785 --> 02:28.535
I had some unfinished
business, I figured

02:28.620 --> 02:31.087
- I'd drop by and say hi.
- Well, I'm glad you did!

02:31.172 --> 02:35.041
- Um, maybe we can have lunch?
- Yeah, we do need to talk.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.066
Well, just say when and where.

02:37.462 --> 02:40.847
OK. Tomorrow. At that
new place in Yorkville.

02:40.882 --> 02:43.766
- One o'clock?
- Great. It's a date.

02:43.852 --> 02:46.853
Not a "date", it's a... you know.

02:46.888 --> 02:49.556
- I do.
- (cell ringing)

02:51.893 --> 02:55.395
It's my inspector;
I sold my house just...

02:55.447 --> 02:58.023
Hey, there. Can you
just give me a second?

02:58.727 --> 03:00.733
Thanks. I gotta take this.

03:00.735 --> 03:02.535
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

03:02.571 --> 03:04.704
Great. Hello?

03:04.739 --> 03:07.345
Yeah. OK.

03:13.164 --> 03:15.548
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

03:15.584 --> 03:18.585
- Smiling.
- But you like it when I smile.

03:18.637 --> 03:20.718
Not when I'm trying to stay mad at you.

03:21.056 --> 03:23.982
How could anyone stay mad at this face?

03:25.341 --> 03:27.427
(stifled snort)

03:28.221 --> 03:29.509
Ah...

03:30.181 --> 03:33.266
Come on, can we just table
the baby talk for now?

03:34.180 --> 03:35.767
I guess we can do that.

03:36.126 --> 03:38.354
- Great.
- But not forever.

03:38.717 --> 03:39.845
I know.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.779
- (door closing)
- I've got

03:46.781 --> 03:48.293
to feed Nick breakfast

03:48.318 --> 03:50.750
and Linda stripped my
kitchen of all gluten.

03:50.785 --> 03:52.952
Well, studies have shown that...

03:53.847 --> 03:55.121
that you should be able

03:55.123 --> 03:56.956
to have whatever you
want in your kitchen?

03:56.958 --> 03:59.292
And that is why I'm
here, to borrow bread

03:59.294 --> 04:01.010
and cereal and then, tonight,

04:01.046 --> 04:03.012
I'm taking back my kitchen
one box of pasta at a time.

04:03.048 --> 04:04.290
Good for you!

04:05.884 --> 04:08.468
You know, I still can't get over you

04:08.520 --> 04:10.803
being an authenticator of art.

04:10.855 --> 04:13.523
- I am!
- You never said!

04:13.558 --> 04:16.108
Well, it's not something that
comes up in conversation.

04:16.144 --> 04:19.144
Ah... You know,

04:19.197 --> 04:21.481
there's a new gallery
opening over in Blairsville.

04:21.483 --> 04:24.367
- We could go check it out.
- I didn't know you were into art!

04:24.402 --> 04:27.487
- ...love art!
- Really?

04:27.539 --> 04:29.822
- Yes!
- What's your favourite period?

04:29.824 --> 04:32.606
The... blue period.

04:33.448 --> 04:37.249
I can't wait to discuss all
things blue with you, soon.

04:39.384 --> 04:41.300
- Thank you!
- Mm-hm!

05:00.021 --> 05:02.739
- Those are beautiful!
- Thanks!

05:03.698 --> 05:06.825
Positively guaranteed to make her swoon.

05:10.582 --> 05:13.199
- Cassie, hey!
- Hi!

05:13.251 --> 05:14.339
What do you think?

05:14.364 --> 05:16.560
Well, you've obviously found your
passion.

05:17.375 --> 05:18.538
Hi, Sophie!

05:18.540 --> 05:19.577
Hey!

05:20.794 --> 05:23.794
Business is booming. I love
being the only flower game in town.

05:23.879 --> 05:25.628
But it's just you and Sophie?

05:25.680 --> 05:27.023
Mm-hm!

05:29.434 --> 05:30.614
Derek!

05:35.347 --> 05:37.557
I have this arrangement for Stephanie

05:37.609 --> 05:41.027
from Ben. Isn't the Bistro
right on your way to work?

05:41.062 --> 05:42.603
Uh...

05:44.065 --> 05:47.450
- Say no more.
- Thank you.

05:49.404 --> 05:51.904
Such a sweet, helpful man.

05:51.956 --> 05:54.407
- Abigail...
- What?

05:55.648 --> 05:57.876
Who doesn't like to be the
bearer of fresh cut flowers?

05:57.912 --> 05:59.912
A small business lives or dies

05:59.998 --> 06:02.215
on how much effort the owner
is willing to put into it.

06:02.250 --> 06:05.301
- I'm working 24-7.
- Ouch!

06:05.386 --> 06:07.470
(phone ringing)

06:11.352 --> 06:12.891
Abigail's Flower Market.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.394
No problem.

06:15.430 --> 06:18.264
- Got it; Thursday.
- (Beep!)

06:18.767 --> 06:20.482
That was Martha;

06:20.518 --> 06:23.603
she ordered 25 centerpieces for
her town hall banquet meeting...

06:23.655 --> 06:26.189
- in three days.
- Great! No problem.

06:26.626 --> 06:28.106
We'll just have to work double time.

06:29.729 --> 06:31.843
Well, sounds like you've
got everything under control!

06:32.642 --> 06:34.210
Don't I always?

06:40.771 --> 06:43.288
Why don't we go to Blairsville
for an early dinner?

06:43.291 --> 06:45.625
Oh, I was thinking we could
get pizza and watch the game.

06:45.627 --> 06:48.344
- Uh-huh...
- You wanna go out, don't you.

06:49.595 --> 06:50.179
OK,

06:50.215 --> 06:52.131
I'll tell you what, I'll record
the game, we go out for dinner.

06:52.133 --> 06:54.462
- Really?
- Yeah! I'll swing by after work

06:54.487 --> 06:56.969
- and pick you up.
- Perfect.

06:57.937 --> 06:59.939
Table 3 asked for you.

06:59.974 --> 07:00.987
OK!

07:03.075 --> 07:05.218
Hi! What can I do for you?

07:05.647 --> 07:08.981
- Stephanie.
- Mom! Heh heh heh!

07:08.983 --> 07:11.098
You're here!

07:12.320 --> 07:15.738
Hmm! Hmm...

07:21.246 --> 07:22.424
(knocking)

07:23.414 --> 07:26.582
I'm running a little behind, sorry.

07:26.959 --> 07:29.635
- Mrs. Benton.
- Uh, it's "Miss".

07:30.087 --> 07:32.366
- I'm single.
- Oh!

07:32.674 --> 07:34.841
- My mistake.
- And it's Sharon.

07:36.104 --> 07:37.008
Well, Sharon,

07:37.305 --> 07:39.011
why don't you tell me
what brought you in today.

07:39.361 --> 07:42.648
- FOP.
- FOP? You think

07:42.684 --> 07:44.684
you have <i>Fibrodysplasia</i>
<i>ossificans progressiva?</i>

07:46.297 --> 07:47.603
It's a pretty rare disease!

07:47.655 --> 07:51.190
(laughing): I think there are
only... 700 confirmed cases.

07:51.192 --> 07:53.492
I know. What are the odds, right?

07:53.982 --> 07:55.862
One in 2 million, actually.

07:56.321 --> 07:58.998
Um, Sharon...

07:59.033 --> 08:02.835
(sighing): ...<i>Fibrodysplasia</i>
<i>ossificans progressive</i> is

08:02.871 --> 08:04.587
a rare genetic disease that causes

08:04.622 --> 08:08.291
the body's fibrous tissue,
ligaments, muscles to transform

08:08.376 --> 08:11.210
- into bone.
- (sighing): I'm so relieved

08:11.262 --> 08:13.276
that you've heard of it.
My last 2 doctors couldn't

08:13.301 --> 08:16.215
- even pronounce it.
- Let me guess; you been online.

08:16.267 --> 08:17.331
Yes.

08:18.793 --> 08:20.019
What makes you think that you have

08:20.054 --> 08:21.888
this incredibly rare disease?

08:22.681 --> 08:24.774
(sighing): I have this dull ache

08:24.809 --> 08:27.222
throughout my entire body,
especially in my ankle.

08:27.442 --> 08:28.329
Why don't we take a look?

08:30.901 --> 08:32.114
Oh, and then, there's this,

08:33.264 --> 08:34.566
my big toe.

08:35.697 --> 08:37.953
It's totally malformed;
classic symptom, right?

08:39.908 --> 08:41.496
Why don't we run some tests

08:41.909 --> 08:44.076
and get an X-ray of that ankle?

08:45.104 --> 08:47.662
If you think that's what's best.

08:58.391 --> 08:59.475
(knocking)

08:59.560 --> 09:01.492
Come in, Chief Sanders!

09:02.852 --> 09:04.346
(more knocking)

09:04.432 --> 09:07.149
(to herself): For goodness sake!
(then): How many times

09:07.235 --> 09:10.102
do I need to tell you that you
don't need to keep knocking

09:10.154 --> 09:11.846
if I've said "come in"!

09:12.573 --> 09:14.824
- Michael!
- Hey, Mom.

09:14.909 --> 09:16.742
You're home! OH!

09:18.175 --> 09:19.275
Ah!

09:19.781 --> 09:21.914
(sniveling): You're too thin;

09:21.950 --> 09:24.083
we must feed you immediately.

09:24.118 --> 09:25.952
(little snicker)

09:26.475 --> 09:28.621
Oh, I'm so sorry,

09:28.673 --> 09:30.623
your order is almost ready.

09:30.708 --> 09:32.541
It's just really crazy here, today.

09:32.593 --> 09:34.627
- Ah, are you OK?
- Ugh! My mother's here

09:34.629 --> 09:37.513
- for her annual visit.
- I love when Betty comes to town.

09:37.548 --> 09:39.849
(with a little laugh): Well,

09:39.934 --> 09:42.518
that's because you aren't
on the receiving end of all

09:42.603 --> 09:44.971
her well-meaning but annoying advice.

09:44.973 --> 09:47.319
- She loves you.
- And I love her.

09:47.787 --> 09:50.476
But she drives me crazy
every time she comes to town

09:50.528 --> 09:53.479
and, since she never bothers you,

09:53.967 --> 09:56.615
- can she stay at Grey House?
- Yes, absolutely!

09:56.651 --> 09:58.585
Great. Here you go!

09:59.537 --> 10:03.290
- So... has she met Ben?
- Absolutely not!

10:03.985 --> 10:05.992
She's gonna love Ben, everyone does.

10:06.044 --> 10:08.377
- But she won't approve of him.
- You're sure

10:08.413 --> 10:11.831
it's your mother who doesn't
approve of Ben's job status?

10:11.833 --> 10:14.667
I like Ben, I do, it's just...

10:14.669 --> 10:17.253
(sighing): ...we're so
different. I don't know,

10:17.305 --> 10:19.505
I think things could work out
between Ben and I, but not

10:19.507 --> 10:23.059
- if my mother gets involved.
- Hiding him from your mom isn't

10:23.094 --> 10:24.981
gonna help things; it may
actually make things worse.

10:26.241 --> 10:28.848
Lunch for two! So,

10:28.850 --> 10:32.318
- who's your date?
- I'm authenticating some art.

10:32.353 --> 10:34.236
Mm-hm! (snigger)

10:36.057 --> 10:37.856
The man at the far table

10:37.859 --> 10:40.860
- looks familiar.
- He should;

10:40.912 --> 10:42.912
he's been in here every day all week.

10:43.695 --> 10:45.376
Fifteen fifty.

10:52.623 --> 10:53.447
So?

10:54.390 --> 10:56.542
Ming Dynasty, 1400 AD.

10:56.627 --> 10:58.544
It's extremely well preserved, no sign

10:58.629 --> 11:00.312
of repair or restoration.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.597
It's a lovely piece,

11:02.633 --> 11:04.383
but it's not the only one of its kind.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.603
Man, you would've made
an amazing archeologist.

11:08.632 --> 11:10.056
I love the past,

11:10.058 --> 11:13.225
but I have found more joy
focusing on the here and now.

11:13.277 --> 11:15.644
Well, not me. When I'm on a dig,

11:15.696 --> 11:18.030
I can imagine what life
was like in simpler times.

11:18.648 --> 11:21.233
- I like that.
- Yeah, but when looking back

11:21.319 --> 11:23.838
sometimes, we remember things
how we thought they were,

11:24.382 --> 11:26.134
instead of how they really were.

11:27.885 --> 11:29.240
True.

11:29.750 --> 11:30.950
Very true.

11:32.751 --> 11:34.080
I would love to take you out.

11:34.896 --> 11:36.048
Pay back the favour.

11:37.066 --> 11:39.085
How about lunch tomorrow
you pick the place.

11:39.659 --> 11:41.087
I have plans with...

11:41.139 --> 11:42.395
a friend.

11:44.411 --> 11:47.093
Well, you let me know
when your schedule clears.

11:59.824 --> 12:02.027
- (door opening)
- Hey!

12:02.062 --> 12:04.443
Hey! I got back from my run
and you guys were gone!

12:04.529 --> 12:05.648
Yeah, well,

12:06.235 --> 12:09.248
Mom was on one of her quests looking

12:09.283 --> 12:11.750
- for freshly pressed juice.
- "Pressed",

12:11.786 --> 12:14.453
- like a... suit?
- It's good for Nick.

12:14.455 --> 12:16.789
Pressed juice is full of nutrients

12:16.841 --> 12:18.924
and vitamins and Nick
needs that, especially

12:18.960 --> 12:21.260
now that he's working out twice a day.

12:21.796 --> 12:24.680
(He sighs, then she sighs.)

12:24.765 --> 12:27.421
- I got rid of all of that.
- Yeah, I put it back.

12:27.423 --> 12:29.969
You know, if you wanna poison
your body, you go right ahead,

12:29.971 --> 12:32.805
- but our son deserves better.
- I'm gonna be late for school.

12:32.857 --> 12:35.191
I'll drive you. Hey, listen, I wanna try

12:35.276 --> 12:38.144
that new Greek restaurant
tonight, you, me and Nick.

12:38.146 --> 12:39.527
My treat, OK?

12:57.377 --> 12:59.293
- Hey, Cassie.
- Hey, Brandon.

12:59.295 --> 13:01.323
I told Grandpa I'd
handle grocery shopping

13:01.359 --> 13:03.965
for him while he's away this
week. Do you have a list for me?

13:04.017 --> 13:05.957
I do!

13:06.206 --> 13:08.924
- Great.
- You know, George usually

13:08.959 --> 13:11.209
picks up the pastries for
the guests' breakfast as well.

13:11.211 --> 13:13.261
Oh, I can do that; Bistro's on my way.

13:13.297 --> 13:16.214
Yeah, I think the Bistro's
an excellent idea.

13:16.216 --> 13:18.316
(little laughs)

13:24.758 --> 13:26.725
Hey, it's the good doctor!

13:27.275 --> 13:28.229
Ryan!

13:29.471 --> 13:30.896
Are you back?

13:30.898 --> 13:32.898
- Yeah, I am!
- Temporarily?

13:33.405 --> 13:35.200
- Depends.
- On..?

13:35.235 --> 13:38.537
- Ah, a lot of things.
- Does Cassie know you're back?

13:38.572 --> 13:41.490
Yeah, she does, actually.
We're having lunch today.

13:44.177 --> 13:47.879
- So, you're still single?
- Yes and Linda's still in town.

13:47.915 --> 13:50.582
Ooh... right; the wife!

13:50.634 --> 13:52.834
- Ex-wife.
- Ex...

13:52.920 --> 13:56.471
- Can't be easy.
- Great for my son, though.

13:56.507 --> 13:59.558
Yeah, of course, of course... Listen,

13:59.593 --> 14:01.226
I'll tell Cassie you said hello.

14:01.261 --> 14:02.515
Great!

14:05.394 --> 14:06.564
Hey, you ready?

14:07.995 --> 14:09.601
For your lesson, yep!

14:10.171 --> 14:12.437
- Was that just Ryan?
- Yeah, it was.

14:13.355 --> 14:14.656
I didn't know he was back in town.

14:14.691 --> 14:16.098
Neither did I.

14:30.541 --> 14:32.457
- It's lovely.
- Oh!

14:32.543 --> 14:34.426
It is! My wife

14:34.461 --> 14:38.013
always wore wraps like this.
She was always cold.

14:38.827 --> 14:41.298
How long... since your wife passed away?

14:42.282 --> 14:44.636
If you were divorced, you
wouldn't still wear the ring.

14:44.721 --> 14:47.856
Ah. A few months ago.

14:47.891 --> 14:51.109
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

14:51.144 --> 14:53.004
I'd like to purchase it.

14:53.897 --> 14:57.482
- Consider it a gift.
- Thank you!

14:57.568 --> 14:58.555
Of course.

15:09.246 --> 15:11.463
Hey! I'm here to pick up
the order for Grey House.

15:11.498 --> 15:13.282
- Thanks.
- (baby cooing)

15:18.672 --> 15:21.089
- He looks just like you.
- (laughing): Hey, man.

15:21.174 --> 15:23.141
Don't joke. Actually, his mom

15:23.176 --> 15:25.227
says that to everybody in the family.

15:25.262 --> 15:27.562
Personally, I think I have better hair.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.278
Meh...

15:29.850 --> 15:32.734
Brandon, meet Max, my nephew.

15:32.819 --> 15:34.736
Hello, Max!

15:34.771 --> 15:36.806
Emergency came up with his mother, so...

15:37.491 --> 15:38.881
- I'm on uncle duty.
- Oh!

15:39.526 --> 15:40.928
Hey, uh...

15:41.495 --> 15:42.944
you think you might be able
to watch him for a little bit?

15:42.996 --> 15:45.196
- I gotta run by the station.
- But you're off today.

15:45.282 --> 15:47.866
I am, and that means
that Don's in charge.

15:48.242 --> 15:50.334
Which is why the dispatcher's
threatening to quit

15:50.370 --> 15:52.871
- and... come on.
- I gotta bring some things

15:52.923 --> 15:54.673
- over to Grey House.
- That's perfect!

15:54.708 --> 15:56.349
I can swing by Grey House;
I'll meet you there!

15:57.758 --> 15:59.044
OK.

15:59.096 --> 16:00.595
Yes!

16:00.631 --> 16:03.048
Just rock him,
alright? He likes movement.

16:03.050 --> 16:05.550
Yeah, well, you know,
what I like is punctuality.

16:05.602 --> 16:08.386
Don't worry, as long
as Max has his pacifier,

16:08.388 --> 16:10.614
it'll be easy! Thank you!

16:11.441 --> 16:12.803
(blowing out air)

16:13.610 --> 16:16.227
(cooing)

16:16.280 --> 16:19.397
How in the world can you
be afraid of squirrels?

16:19.399 --> 16:22.901
Oh, how can you not be?
Their little diabolical paws,

16:22.953 --> 16:24.107
their scrunched up faces

16:24.132 --> 16:26.371
and that squirrel darted right
in front of us on purpose.

16:26.406 --> 16:29.574
- You give him too much credit.
- He was messing with me.

16:29.626 --> 16:31.910
- Spiders.
- What about them?

16:31.912 --> 16:34.629
They're my squirrel; I hate them.

16:34.665 --> 16:36.965
But spiders are good
luck, whereas squirrels...

16:37.000 --> 16:39.084
...menacingly dart out
at the traffic on purpose?

16:39.136 --> 16:41.086
Yes, exactly. (chuckles)

16:41.088 --> 16:44.139
This has been fun,
teaching you to drive.

16:44.174 --> 16:46.808
- Well, it's not over yet.
- True!

16:46.843 --> 16:49.265
You probably have time for
one more lesson before you test.

16:49.938 --> 16:53.264
- And you don't need a ride?
- No, I'm fine.

16:53.317 --> 16:54.413
See ya!

16:59.974 --> 17:01.342
OK, bye-bye.

17:08.589 --> 17:09.747
These are all from Sharon.

17:09.782 --> 17:12.584
At this point, she needs
her own dedicated phone line.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.752
You do know she has

17:14.788 --> 17:15.611
a reputation, right?

17:16.790 --> 17:19.840
Not that kind of reputation!
She's in that book club

17:19.876 --> 17:21.876
that I joined. Mm-hm, rumour

17:21.962 --> 17:24.128
is, she spends most of her time

17:24.181 --> 17:26.765
going from one doctor's
office to another.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.169
Yet, she never gets better.

17:29.603 --> 17:33.388
- Think she's a hypochondriac?
- I don't think she's actually sick.

17:35.308 --> 17:37.809
As much as I trust
the diagnostic ability

17:37.861 --> 17:40.812
of your book club, my gut tells
me that something is wrong.

17:40.864 --> 17:44.115
OK... you're the doctor!

17:44.646 --> 17:46.284
I am.

17:46.319 --> 17:48.486
But when you find out that I'm right

17:48.572 --> 17:51.956
and you're wrong, I so
get to say, I told you so.

17:53.710 --> 17:56.995
So, I was thinking, cocktail
hour with a specialty drink,

17:57.080 --> 17:59.664
and then, a formal sit down dinner.

17:59.716 --> 18:02.467
Steak and lobster.
Ooh! A real celebration!

18:02.502 --> 18:05.336
What do you think? Tom?!

18:05.389 --> 18:08.139
Tom!! What do you think?

18:09.152 --> 18:11.176
Michael's welcome home party.

18:11.228 --> 18:14.145
He's moving back because
he got fired and he's broke.

18:14.181 --> 18:15.897
He quit that terrible job.

18:15.932 --> 18:18.349
It was unsuitable for his
intellect and his abilities.

18:18.402 --> 18:20.852
He was a waiter in a themed restaurant.

18:20.854 --> 18:23.104
So you agree! Completely beneath him.

18:23.156 --> 18:24.632
He's... he's special.

18:24.684 --> 18:26.691
- He's a real talent.
- Martha,

18:26.743 --> 18:29.360
he's an adult and he's
gotta grow up someday.

18:29.413 --> 18:31.181
Let's make that "someday" now.

18:31.851 --> 18:34.179
Maybe we should have
his party at a restaurant!

18:36.753 --> 18:39.100
Your cousin Jennifer just got engaged.

18:39.662 --> 18:42.590
Shy little Jennifer
getting married before you;

18:42.676 --> 18:45.710
- it's inconceivable!
- Ugh, OK,

18:45.712 --> 18:48.379
she has been dating
her fiancé since middle school.

18:48.381 --> 18:51.883
It's not only conceivable,
it's a little bit anticlimactic.

18:51.885 --> 18:54.052
I just don't like the idea of you alone.

18:54.054 --> 18:56.137
I want you to put
yourself out there, you..

18:56.223 --> 18:57.939
you need to date, you need a plan!

18:57.974 --> 19:00.892
OK, if I fall in love
and it all works out,

19:00.894 --> 19:03.394
I'll get married. That's not a plan,

19:03.396 --> 19:06.948
- that's a dream.
- Thanks, Mom.

19:09.950 --> 19:12.403
Just came in to get a potted
plant for my mother and I'm

19:12.456 --> 19:15.406
- leaving with 2 dozen roses!
- Such a good son!

19:15.408 --> 19:18.361
(chuckle) And handsome too!

19:18.829 --> 19:19.561
Ha!

19:21.157 --> 19:22.723
It's OK, Sophie, I got this one.

19:23.535 --> 19:24.916
(sigh)

19:24.968 --> 19:27.302
Thank you

19:27.337 --> 19:30.255
- so much.
- This arrangement

19:30.257 --> 19:32.423
that Martha ordered is very complicated

19:32.425 --> 19:35.093
- and time consuming.
- Oh, you'll get it!

19:35.145 --> 19:38.680
- You always do.
- (sigh)

19:41.101 --> 19:43.768
- Hi!
- Wow!

19:43.820 --> 19:47.572
- Abigail, this place is great!
- Thanks! Sit?

19:47.607 --> 19:49.774
I don't know, you look
very busy, it's fine.

19:49.826 --> 19:51.609
I'm never too busy
for my favourite cousin.

19:52.360 --> 19:53.577
Girl talk?

19:53.613 --> 19:56.087
Always. (little chuckle)

19:57.117 --> 20:00.251
Oh! Let me, let me, it's OK.

20:00.287 --> 20:03.037
Thanks. Ah, I've just been working

20:03.123 --> 20:05.039
so hard on this big order from Martha,

20:05.125 --> 20:07.792
- I must just be exhausted.
- Oh, well,

20:07.844 --> 20:09.627
if you want, I'm happy to help.

20:09.713 --> 20:12.630
Only if you want to;
Sophie's a little overwhelmed.

20:13.738 --> 20:14.916
Just layer each vase with

20:14.951 --> 20:17.802
an even mix of pebbles and then
Sophie will add the flowers.

20:17.888 --> 20:20.805
OK! So, tell me,

20:20.857 --> 20:23.141
what's it like to own your own business?

20:23.193 --> 20:25.208
It's super fun!

20:26.080 --> 20:27.979
So you guys are good here, then?

20:28.031 --> 20:29.647
- What?
- Great,

20:29.699 --> 20:32.199
- 'cause I could really use a break.
- Oh.

20:33.350 --> 20:34.774
Ha.

20:36.873 --> 20:38.823
So, uh,

20:38.875 --> 20:41.326
- you sold your house?
- Yeah, but it failed

20:41.378 --> 20:43.628
- the electrical inspection.
- You should get a second

20:43.663 --> 20:46.331
- opinion, another inspection.
- There's a backlog

20:46.416 --> 20:48.488
of inspectors, it would take
too long to make an appointment.

20:49.135 --> 20:51.469
I bet Martha would help you out.

20:51.504 --> 20:53.972
I think she has not forgotten

20:54.007 --> 20:56.140
that I helped bring that
mall project to Blairsville.

20:56.176 --> 20:59.057
Well, people can surprise you.

20:59.563 --> 21:01.563
Yeah... sometimes,

21:01.648 --> 21:03.731
in good ways and sometimes,

21:03.817 --> 21:05.192
in not so good ways.

21:07.167 --> 21:09.069
I surprised you, that night.

21:09.155 --> 21:10.640
Yeah.

21:13.441 --> 21:15.158
What happened?

21:15.752 --> 21:17.694
I mean, I didn't imagine

21:17.747 --> 21:19.781
what was going on
between us before that night

21:19.866 --> 21:22.450
and I know I did not imagine
what I saw between you and Sam.

21:24.788 --> 21:27.205
I think I want an explanation.

21:27.929 --> 21:30.424
When Sam almost kissed me...

21:30.832 --> 21:33.011
I was as surprised as you.

21:33.616 --> 21:35.380
That he wanted to kiss you?

21:35.968 --> 21:37.714
That I wanted to kiss him.

21:38.488 --> 21:41.051
So why aren't you two together?

21:41.361 --> 21:44.009
Because I'm still not
ready to be with anyone.

21:44.524 --> 21:46.041
So there's still a chance

21:46.693 --> 21:48.726
that maybe, when you are ready,

21:48.728 --> 21:49.865
we could start again?

21:51.888 --> 21:53.898
I don't feel that way about you.

21:53.950 --> 21:55.630
I thought I did but I don't.

21:59.728 --> 22:02.729
- OK.
- Look, we were friends

22:02.754 --> 22:04.887
before we were anything else.

22:05.161 --> 22:07.633
Yeah, but I always wanted more.

22:10.583 --> 22:12.448
I'm so sorry.

22:12.702 --> 22:13.606
Me too.

22:14.971 --> 22:17.005
'Cause I can't forget how I feel

22:17.057 --> 22:19.090
and just go back to being friends.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.092
(sigh)

22:25.232 --> 22:26.865
(birds chirping)

22:30.163 --> 22:31.640
Brandon? Where are you?

22:32.239 --> 22:36.027
- Back here!
- I got your text,

22:36.052 --> 22:37.542
what's the emergency?

22:41.264 --> 22:44.246
Oh! Oh wow!

22:44.866 --> 22:48.825
- That's really cute!
- Well, don't get any ideas.

22:48.939 --> 22:51.073
Too late. Where did the baby

22:51.108 --> 22:52.444
come from? Hi!

22:53.160 --> 22:55.110
Um, this is Derek's nephew,

22:55.145 --> 22:57.012
Max. Uh, here.

22:57.047 --> 22:59.448
Oh! Uh...

22:59.450 --> 23:01.750
- Where's Derek?
- He's stuck at the station.

23:01.785 --> 23:03.752
- Hello!
- (cooing)

23:03.787 --> 23:05.704
Oh my goodness! Um, here.

23:05.789 --> 23:08.790
- Oh! Ha ha.
- (cooing)

23:08.792 --> 23:11.343
- Oh, you're a natural.
- Ha ha!

23:11.378 --> 23:13.629
But seriously, I need you to take him

23:13.681 --> 23:17.466
- 'cause I need a break.
- Oh, why don't you just stay?

23:17.518 --> 23:19.674
We'll do it together, it'll be fun.

23:22.723 --> 23:25.107
Ah, almost.

23:25.450 --> 23:27.809
You just need to put
a little more arc on it.

23:31.674 --> 23:33.231
Uh, Mom texted;

23:33.929 --> 23:36.150
said she was making chicken.

23:36.203 --> 23:38.704
OK.

23:38.789 --> 23:40.622
Uh, Dad?

23:41.209 --> 23:43.325
- Yeah?
- I gotta ask,

23:43.793 --> 23:46.328
did you and Mom ever get along?

23:46.413 --> 23:48.330
Oh yeah, sure!

23:48.415 --> 23:49.882
When we first got married.

23:50.831 --> 23:52.383
Well, what happened?

23:52.906 --> 23:56.138
People change. We... changed.

23:56.173 --> 23:59.841
All I can remember since I was
a kid was... you two fighting.

24:00.353 --> 24:02.553
Now, it's like a normal family.

24:03.594 --> 24:05.013
It's nice having Mom around.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.015
Well, she loves you very much.

24:11.021 --> 24:13.238
- Hey, Grace!
- Oh! Hey!

24:13.273 --> 24:14.181
What's up?

24:15.275 --> 24:17.075
You ready for your last driving lesson?

24:17.161 --> 24:19.361
Um, actually,

24:19.413 --> 24:22.080
I was thinking about that
and... it may not be our last.

24:22.116 --> 24:24.750
- Why, what do you mean?
- I thought

24:24.835 --> 24:26.835
maybe I would postpone my driving test.

24:27.654 --> 24:30.589
It's just I have a lot going
on and I can always take it

24:30.674 --> 24:32.758
next year. Plus it'll give
you and I more time to practice.

24:33.221 --> 24:36.877
- You're ready.
- I don't think I am.

24:38.622 --> 24:39.715
Anyways, you guys have fun.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.927
I won't keep you.

24:43.291 --> 24:44.720
What was all that about?

24:46.267 --> 24:47.494
I don't know.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.571
Enjoy.

24:50.144 --> 24:53.061
Mom! Don't look so surprised.

24:53.063 --> 24:55.864
I just thought you were doing
that walking tour of downtown.

24:55.899 --> 24:58.367
Oh, I'd much rather spend time with you!

24:58.865 --> 25:00.786
- Hey!
- Oh, why don't you

25:00.821 --> 25:03.205
head back to Grey House
and relax, and I can...

25:03.240 --> 25:06.124
- I just got here.
- Right, OK,

25:06.160 --> 25:08.293
I, um, I just need to see a customer

25:08.328 --> 25:10.579
but you stay, right here, OK?

25:11.328 --> 25:12.964
- Hi!
- (embarrassed chuckle)

25:13.000 --> 25:15.550
So, let's just head out of here.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.087
(laughing): Wait,

25:19.139 --> 25:20.972
I was just gonna sit at the counter.

25:21.008 --> 25:24.309
Oh! Why would you wanna be
inside, it's so beautiful out.

25:24.344 --> 25:27.396
- Who's that woman you were talking to?
- Oh, no one.

25:27.431 --> 25:30.265
Hey, here's an idea, since it's so busy,

25:30.267 --> 25:32.601
why don't I personally
deliver a late lunch to you

25:32.653 --> 25:35.153
- once the crowd dies down.
- I was just gonna have a snack.

25:35.189 --> 25:37.272
Snack, lunch; whatever! Heh heh!

25:37.869 --> 25:39.324
- OK..!
- OK!

25:39.721 --> 25:41.334
(chuckles)

25:44.933 --> 25:46.363
(little chuckle)

25:47.254 --> 25:48.949
Aah...

25:49.702 --> 25:50.952
Who was that man?

25:51.004 --> 25:53.422
Oh, uh, just a customer.

25:54.169 --> 25:55.289
Ah, see,

25:55.342 --> 25:57.175
your attitude is part of the problem.

25:57.211 --> 25:59.350
That cute man could be...

25:59.630 --> 26:01.463
more than just a customer.

26:02.151 --> 26:03.390
Hm.

26:04.184 --> 26:06.351
- (door chimes)
- Martha,

26:06.386 --> 26:08.970
- you are beaming!
- Michael's home.

26:08.972 --> 26:11.440
And all is right with the world.

26:11.475 --> 26:13.942
He quit that horrible job in California

26:13.977 --> 26:16.478
and he's decided to move
back to Middleton permanently.

26:16.530 --> 26:19.314
Oh, so he'll be
looking for a job locally?

26:19.366 --> 26:21.066
Uh-uh! Not a job; a career.

26:21.712 --> 26:23.716
Ah... Hm...

26:30.828 --> 26:34.045
This is infused with amber, which

26:34.131 --> 26:36.798
ancient civilizations believed
contained rays of the sun.

26:36.834 --> 26:40.502
Amber's restorative and has
the ability to light a fire

26:40.587 --> 26:44.005
under people, so to speak.
To help with Michael's career.

26:44.057 --> 26:46.725
Oh, well, thank you! But no.

26:46.810 --> 26:49.678
Michael doesn't need any hocus pocus.

26:49.763 --> 26:51.897
He will be gainfully and properly

26:51.982 --> 26:55.016
employed by tomorrow. I...

26:55.491 --> 26:59.187
I pulled a few strings
and I set up a job interview

26:59.273 --> 27:01.356
for assistant to the
Middleton bank president.

27:01.441 --> 27:03.819
I'll have Michael's
career on track in no time.

27:04.361 --> 27:07.863
- Well, tell Michael I wish him luck.
- My dear Cassie,

27:07.915 --> 27:11.700
luck is not necessary
when you're a Tinsdale!

27:11.752 --> 27:12.907
(snigger)

27:16.173 --> 27:19.257
- Hey.
- Aw, what took you so long?

27:19.293 --> 27:21.209
I had to go to 2 different stores

27:21.211 --> 27:23.461
- to find the right diapers.
- I've never seen so much stuff

27:23.547 --> 27:26.548
- come out of something so small!
- (chuckles)

27:27.424 --> 27:29.601
Yeah, but he is awfully cute.

27:29.636 --> 27:33.688
- Aw, he hates me.
- What, how can you say that?

27:33.953 --> 27:35.524
Here.

27:35.559 --> 27:37.726
OK. Come here, buddy.

27:38.420 --> 27:39.727
- Oh yeah.
- Ah!

27:39.730 --> 27:42.230
Why does he like you more than me?

27:42.282 --> 27:45.233
- It's not a competition.
- Yeah, says the guy winning.

27:45.285 --> 27:47.402
Hey, I'm wearing a t-shirt
I found in the trunk

27:47.487 --> 27:49.955
and I smell like baby puke. Honey,

27:49.990 --> 27:52.290
there are no winners in this room.

27:52.376 --> 27:55.076
- He's probably just hungry.
- But if we feed him,

27:55.128 --> 27:57.045
he's just gonna use up
all the diapers again.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.548
Check the bag, there's
probably a bottle of formula.

27:59.583 --> 28:01.800
- Uh, yeah.
- So, warm it up

28:01.835 --> 28:03.635
and, um, test the
temperature on your wrist.

28:05.428 --> 28:07.388
I used to take care
of Grace when she was a baby.

28:08.218 --> 28:09.724
Didn't you ever babysit
when you were young?

28:09.760 --> 28:12.509
No. And I was an only child.

28:17.135 --> 28:19.100
Don't worry, buddy, I'll test it

28:19.152 --> 28:21.100
- before I give you the bottle.
- (glass shattering)

28:22.530 --> 28:24.105
Just to be safe.

28:24.157 --> 28:26.191
(baby cooing loudly)

28:26.243 --> 28:28.577
Yeah, well, would it kill you
to give her a smile?

28:29.573 --> 28:32.613
What's bothering you? Your forehead gets

28:32.616 --> 28:34.916
a certain pattern when you
try to figure something out.

28:34.952 --> 28:37.252
And that's a pretty
big medical file, there.

28:37.287 --> 28:40.005
(sighing): There is something
wrong with this patient

28:40.040 --> 28:41.756
- and I don't know what.
- Hm.

28:42.732 --> 28:43.958
But I'll figure it out.

28:44.621 --> 28:45.827
I like that about you.

28:46.296 --> 28:49.180
- My tenacity?
- One of your best qualities.

28:49.216 --> 28:52.517
(chuckles) Um...

28:52.552 --> 28:53.917
Ryan is back.

28:54.554 --> 28:55.820
We had lunch...

28:56.556 --> 28:59.224
Um... I meant to tell you.

28:59.885 --> 29:01.644
But you were hesitant.

29:03.012 --> 29:05.480
Ryan brings up a lot of things for me.

29:07.276 --> 29:08.816
So, how was lunch?

29:08.819 --> 29:10.702
Ugh... complicated.

29:11.284 --> 29:13.705
How did you leave things?

29:13.740 --> 29:15.657
Well, he wants something
from me that I just can't

29:15.659 --> 29:18.793
give him no matter how much I
care about him, so... not well.

29:18.829 --> 29:22.130
- Hm...
- Seeing Ryan and talking to him

29:22.165 --> 29:24.299
just made me realize that,
right now, I'm not ready

29:24.334 --> 29:26.251
for anything more than friendship.

29:27.055 --> 29:28.419
Duly noted.

29:30.340 --> 29:32.996
And look, as... your friend,

29:33.343 --> 29:35.828
who... just wants you to be happy,

29:36.860 --> 29:38.899
I really hope you're able
to patch things up with him.

29:39.266 --> 29:41.016
Thank you, Sam.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.934
And for the record,

29:44.460 --> 29:46.320
if I had been Ryan,
that wouldn't have happened.

29:46.356 --> 29:48.857
'Cause I never would've left you behind.

30:04.658 --> 30:06.992
- It's hard, huh? I was just...
- Quiet!

30:07.077 --> 30:08.513
He just stopped crying.

30:09.079 --> 30:11.296
(sighing): I can't take anymore crying.

30:11.331 --> 30:13.265
He's a baby; it's his primary

30:13.300 --> 30:14.921
mode of communication.

30:16.002 --> 30:18.302
(baby whimpering)

30:18.338 --> 30:20.839
Where's his pacifier?

30:22.203 --> 30:23.675
(whimper)

30:23.744 --> 30:27.512
- He just had it!
- (Baby starts to cry.)

30:27.514 --> 30:29.731
We have to find it.

30:32.853 --> 30:34.486
When I left him with you, he had it!

30:34.521 --> 30:37.022
Hey, we need to hold the line,
here, can't turn on each other!

30:37.074 --> 30:38.907
OK, OK.

30:38.992 --> 30:40.620
Maybe there's a spare.

30:43.030 --> 30:45.530
- Ah, no luck.
- Hm... Oh!

30:45.532 --> 30:47.666
Kitchen. Kitchen, what?

30:47.701 --> 30:49.918
Tara, he can't walk! What do you think;

30:49.953 --> 30:52.704
he took it out, crawled into
the kitchen and still fully

30:52.706 --> 30:56.007
made his way back? I mean, he's
a baby, he's not Delta Force!

30:56.043 --> 30:59.044
(cooing)

31:04.217 --> 31:05.342
Found it.

31:06.053 --> 31:07.854
Hiding in plain sight!

31:09.606 --> 31:11.062
(cooing) There you go!

31:11.808 --> 31:14.285
See? Everything's OK.

31:19.950 --> 31:21.206
- Hey!
- Hi!

31:22.402 --> 31:24.869
(conversations)

31:31.628 --> 31:33.578
Does she know who it's from?

31:33.630 --> 31:34.606
No.

31:36.581 --> 31:38.917
Well, she does bear
a striking resemblance

31:38.969 --> 31:41.532
- to your wife.
- It's uncanny.

31:42.547 --> 31:44.771
I know you don't wanna hear this, but...

31:45.258 --> 31:47.955
Stephanie's not the answer
to your problems.

31:50.657 --> 31:52.707
(phone ringing)

31:55.602 --> 31:57.652
(banging into the door)

31:59.523 --> 32:02.190
- (key rattling in latch)
- Sophie!

32:02.242 --> 32:04.526
(phone still ringing)

32:04.611 --> 32:05.886
Sophie!!

32:06.947 --> 32:09.447
- (sigh)
- (Beep!)

32:09.794 --> 32:12.450
Abigail's Flower Market,
this is Abigail speaking.

32:12.536 --> 32:14.018
Hi, Martha!

32:17.136 --> 32:20.623
_

32:21.424 --> 32:23.567
Uh... Sorry!

32:23.880 --> 32:25.728
25 more centerpieces for the banquet.

32:26.943 --> 32:29.103
Yes, that does make 50.

32:31.107 --> 32:32.983
Yeah, of course, of course; got it.

32:33.109 --> 32:35.360
Two days. (breathing in)

32:35.385 --> 32:36.498
No problem.

32:39.155 --> 32:40.779
(Beep!)

32:47.571 --> 32:49.974
Sharon called; she
wants another appointment.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.005
Well, let's... squeeze her in.

32:52.899 --> 32:54.993
(taking a deep breath): Doc...

32:55.078 --> 32:57.662
you DO see what she's doing, don't you?

32:58.340 --> 32:59.709
What are you talking about?

33:01.433 --> 33:05.302
- She's crushing on you.
- (guffawing): That's nonsense.

33:05.748 --> 33:07.865
OK! But watch yourself

33:07.890 --> 33:09.640
'cause from where I stand,

33:09.752 --> 33:11.502
you're like a turkey

33:11.560 --> 33:14.536
walking around, one day
before Thanksgiving,

33:15.015 --> 33:17.398
clueless and on the menu.

33:20.403 --> 33:22.353
(conversations)

33:22.405 --> 33:23.688
Michael!

33:24.242 --> 33:26.192
- Hey, Mom.
- Well? Tell me

33:26.194 --> 33:28.111
how the interview went!
When do you start?

33:28.196 --> 33:30.080
What's your salary? Any perks? Will you

33:30.165 --> 33:32.666
- have your own assistant?
- No, I didn't go.

33:32.701 --> 33:35.335
Mom, being an assistant at my
age is not what I had in mind.

33:35.370 --> 33:38.089
I wanna hold out for something better
that showcases my talent.

33:38.590 --> 33:39.604
- Oh...
- (cell ring)

33:39.629 --> 33:43.217
I gotta take this. Danny!

33:44.212 --> 33:46.212
Yeah! Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, hold on.

33:46.298 --> 33:48.715
Mom, I was gonna go meet Danny,

33:48.800 --> 33:51.768
you know, from high school.
Do you have any cash?

33:52.057 --> 33:53.801
Just enough to get me through the week.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.072
Ah!

33:57.358 --> 33:58.592
You're the best, Mom.

33:59.858 --> 34:01.277
It's good to be home.

34:01.363 --> 34:02.530
Hm!

34:09.154 --> 34:12.371
- Well, hello there!
- Oh! Hi!

34:12.969 --> 34:14.908
- What's up?
- Well, I was at the Bistro,

34:14.960 --> 34:17.127
studying, and they had
one piece of that chocolate cake

34:17.212 --> 34:18.911
that you like, so I got it for you.

34:18.964 --> 34:21.246
As a thank you for the lessons.

34:21.638 --> 34:23.465
- Well, that's thoughtful!
- Hm, thanks.

34:23.502 --> 34:25.918
- Actually, glad you're here.
- You are?!

34:25.971 --> 34:28.638
- Yeah, I wanna talk to you.
- Me?

34:28.672 --> 34:29.822
Sit down.

34:32.844 --> 34:34.206
Aah...

34:34.846 --> 34:36.525
What's going on?

34:37.681 --> 34:40.630
Why don't you wanna take your test?

34:43.021 --> 34:44.670
I'm just not ready. Heh!

34:45.273 --> 34:47.440
Was it... our lessons?

34:47.442 --> 34:50.243
Oh, no-no. You're a great teacher.

34:50.277 --> 34:51.847
You didn't do anything.

34:53.190 --> 34:55.496
Are you... having trouble at school?

34:55.534 --> 34:57.500
- No.
- Home..?

34:57.536 --> 34:58.566
No.

34:59.538 --> 35:02.038
And I'd prefer not
to really talk about it.

35:02.090 --> 35:04.674
OK, I won't push, but...

35:04.709 --> 35:07.761
if you do wanna tell me, I'm here.

35:08.518 --> 35:10.129
Thanks for the cake.

35:10.132 --> 35:11.959
Yeah. (little chuckle)

35:15.203 --> 35:17.270
(sigh)

35:21.393 --> 35:23.476
Hello, there!

35:23.478 --> 35:24.607
Hi!

35:25.433 --> 35:27.156
Uh, do you know where the sugar is?

35:27.232 --> 35:30.150
Uh, sugar... uh, I don't.

35:30.235 --> 35:32.735
- Oh, you're not a guest here.
- No, no, I'm just here

35:32.788 --> 35:34.333
to do some work for Cassie.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.540
You were at the Bistro today, right?

35:38.575 --> 35:40.960
Yeah. Hey, you were
talking to Stephanie.

35:40.996 --> 35:43.463
- Oh, you know Stephanie?
- Very well!

35:43.498 --> 35:45.329
- Me too!
- Really?

35:45.667 --> 35:47.729
I'm her mother.

35:50.698 --> 35:52.839
Thanks a lot.

35:54.090 --> 35:55.508
- Oh!
- Oh!

35:55.560 --> 35:57.844
- Hi.
- Hi! Uh...

35:57.896 --> 35:59.679
how goes the hunt for a new inspector?

36:00.106 --> 36:02.848
Not good, actually.
If I don't find someone quickly

36:02.851 --> 36:05.351
to give my house a clean bill of health,
that deal's gonna fall through.

36:05.697 --> 36:08.020
Well, some losses
are worth fighting for.

36:08.530 --> 36:10.356
Oh!

36:10.442 --> 36:13.109
Sorry, I... You know,
it's my fault anyway;

36:13.161 --> 36:15.695
I should've waited for my guy
to do the work instead of...

36:15.747 --> 36:17.664
Oh! Hello!

36:19.600 --> 36:20.415
Martha?

36:20.502 --> 36:23.369
- Goodbye!
- Martha. Martha!

36:23.421 --> 36:26.039
- (big sigh)
- I know you don't owe me

36:26.091 --> 36:28.675
any favours. But I need
a new electrical inspector.

36:29.180 --> 36:31.427
I can have someone
at your house later today.

36:32.075 --> 36:34.213
(sighing with relief): I owe
you. I owe you, thank you.

36:34.299 --> 36:37.100
Oh, I'm not doing it for you;
I'm doing it for Cassie.

36:37.185 --> 36:40.220
Because any friend of Cassie's
is a friend of mine, no matter

36:40.305 --> 36:43.473
how traitorous he may
have been in the past. Hm!

36:46.178 --> 36:47.109
<i>Because</i>

36:47.145 --> 36:49.112
- it makes the most sense!
- No!

36:49.197 --> 36:50.697
Why shouldn't I move
into your spare room?

36:50.732 --> 36:52.899
This is not some cute romantic
comedy where the divorced

36:52.951 --> 36:55.368
parents live together for the
sake of the child and everything

36:55.403 --> 36:58.154
- works out in the end.
- Look, Sam,

36:58.206 --> 37:01.212
this whole family thing
is no picnic for me either.

37:01.897 --> 37:03.960
I am trying so hard

37:03.995 --> 37:05.795
to stay current at
my job that I have worked

37:05.830 --> 37:08.081
my entire career to land.

37:08.133 --> 37:10.633
But I'm not in New York, I'm here.

37:10.669 --> 37:12.685
Because I love our son too.

37:13.388 --> 37:17.307
I wanna move in to be
closer to my Nick. OK?!

37:44.746 --> 37:45.894
Derek!

37:46.748 --> 37:49.732
Sorry, I'm late!

37:49.768 --> 37:50.975
Ugh...

37:57.224 --> 37:59.374
Hi! Where's Sophie?

37:59.410 --> 38:01.316
- She quit.
- Ah!

38:01.384 --> 38:03.551
That happens when
employees are overwhelmed.

38:03.553 --> 38:05.553
Sophie wasn't overwhelmed,
she just wasn't a go-getter.

38:06.298 --> 38:07.971
I'll find other people to help out.

38:08.260 --> 38:11.058
Don't worry, things
always work out for me.

38:11.445 --> 38:14.061
Well, new business thrives
or dies on reputation.

38:14.113 --> 38:15.896
If you don't deliver an important order

38:15.898 --> 38:17.612
to a very vocal town mayor,

38:18.150 --> 38:20.001
I think Martha will make sure
everyone hears about it.

38:20.764 --> 38:22.903
I'm the only flower shop in town.

38:22.955 --> 38:26.406
The one in Blairsville is
3 times the size and delivers.

38:26.773 --> 38:29.910
People will think twice about
going to a place that has proven

38:29.962 --> 38:31.135
to be unreliable.

38:33.682 --> 38:35.666
Give them a discount and tell them

38:35.751 --> 38:37.801
thank you very much for waiting. OK?

38:37.837 --> 38:39.808
Uh, table for 2, please!

38:42.258 --> 38:44.424
I'm... treating my new friend!

38:44.426 --> 38:45.768
Ah...

38:54.153 --> 38:56.854
(door opening and chimes)

39:03.913 --> 39:05.863
I came to say goodbye.

39:06.330 --> 39:09.616
- Your house passed inspection?
- Oh gosh, no.

39:09.702 --> 39:12.119
But Martha's inspector referred
me to a reasonable electrician

39:12.171 --> 39:15.316
who can do the job quickly
so the sale can go through.

39:15.401 --> 39:17.616
Well, sometimes, we all
need a little rewiring.

39:18.844 --> 39:20.794
Mm-hm. You told me

39:20.846 --> 39:22.846
that sometimes, people can surprise you.

39:23.344 --> 39:24.598
Hm!

39:25.272 --> 39:26.809
Listen, I didn't...

39:27.386 --> 39:30.687
exactly leave things
with you in a very good place

39:30.773 --> 39:32.973
and yet you helped me. Thank you.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.108
You said you couldn't be my friend,

39:35.144 --> 39:36.888
but I never said
I couldn't be your friend.

39:37.641 --> 39:39.480
Yeah... I guess

39:39.532 --> 39:41.698
we've come full circle, haven't we.

39:42.312 --> 39:43.700
Well...

39:43.736 --> 39:45.801
maybe that means we can
start all over again.

39:47.008 --> 39:48.488
I think we just did.

39:49.424 --> 39:50.958
Friends hug, right?

39:50.993 --> 39:53.210
Yeah, good friends hug.

39:57.249 --> 39:59.333
(crickets)

40:04.590 --> 40:06.557
(door opening)

40:06.592 --> 40:08.048
(door closing)

40:09.919 --> 40:12.179
Hey!

40:12.680 --> 40:14.348
Oh...

40:14.400 --> 40:16.567
- (cooing)
- He's adorable.

40:16.602 --> 40:18.734
- How long has he been here?
- All day.

40:19.355 --> 40:20.950
Derek's on his way over now.

40:21.857 --> 40:24.691
Did you, uh, pick up
everything I need at the Bistro?

40:24.693 --> 40:27.277
(little sigh)

40:37.756 --> 40:40.340
Ahem! You wanna talk about it?

40:40.376 --> 40:41.590
No!

40:43.879 --> 40:45.184
Aah...

40:46.548 --> 40:47.662
Linda.

40:48.517 --> 40:50.213
I'm at an impasse.

40:50.769 --> 40:53.553
Marriage may not be
forever, but kids are.

40:53.606 --> 40:54.941
So I have a choice,

40:55.724 --> 40:58.025
I can either make Nick
happy and be miserable

40:58.060 --> 41:00.861
or make myself happy and hurt Nick.

41:01.271 --> 41:02.863
(He sighs.)

41:03.847 --> 41:05.866
I heard Ryan left town, are you OK?

41:06.158 --> 41:08.568
Yeah, it's always a little
sad when friends leave.

41:08.999 --> 41:11.371
- Friends again?
- We patched things up.

41:11.407 --> 41:13.073
- I'm glad.
- Thank you.

41:13.125 --> 41:16.243
So, do you have any of that
tea that tastes like coffee?

41:16.295 --> 41:18.912
I do and I am making
pasta tonight, for dinner.

41:18.914 --> 41:20.914
- Ah, gluten!
- (laughing): Yay!

41:20.916 --> 41:22.966
- Let's!
- OK!
