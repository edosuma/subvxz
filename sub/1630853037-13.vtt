00:03.795 --> 00:06.464
♪ ♪

00:06.506 --> 00:08.216
But it's just static.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.676
Exactly.

00:09.718 --> 00:12.387
I believe it's a pivot point.
A what?

00:12.429 --> 00:14.597
A point in time where history
can be fundamentally changed.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.725
In that one moment,
the future remains unwritten.

00:27.485 --> 00:29.154
I found it.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.364
I'm sorry, I wish we could
just curl up on the couch

00:31.406 --> 00:33.199
and cry together,
but we can't.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.076
Not while the Unseen have
The Book of Shadows.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.995
The Unseen?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.205
You're seriously gonna bring
that up right now?

00:39.247 --> 00:40.749
I know it's not easy.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.584
But this is the job.
We're the Charmed Ones.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.252
No, you're the Charmed Ones.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.171
I'm not even
your biological sister.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.922
You are our sister.

00:47.964 --> 00:49.883
Biological and chosen.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.801
I didn't choose any of this.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.849
Did she just bail?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.809
Oh, yes, she did.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.812
And it's the first step
in everything falling apart.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.939
Got to show you both something.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.441
Uh, can it wait?

01:06.483 --> 01:08.485
We're sort of in the middle
of something big.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.028
Big like
a Bee Bop murder,

01:10.070 --> 01:11.321
which Roxie's about
to pull you into?

01:11.362 --> 01:12.822
Someone killed a Bee Bop?

01:12.864 --> 01:14.741
Not someone. It was Lloyd.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.535
In the dollhouse bathroom
with the knife.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.747
And you're about to turn
into a pixie, sprout wings,

01:20.789 --> 01:23.041
and fly.
It's super cool, but...

01:23.083 --> 01:25.335
it won't stop seven billion
humans from becoming trees.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.420
Trees. As in...

01:27.462 --> 01:29.089
Green, leafy.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.507
Poof!

01:30.548 --> 01:33.259
Um, Josefina,
are you okay?

01:33.301 --> 01:35.887
I'm fine.
Everything else is not.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.099
Debes escucharme.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.102
It's all here.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.561
And you need to watch.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.688
'Cause we only have
one last chance

01:45.730 --> 01:48.233
to save the world.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.450
(gasping)

01:57.492 --> 02:00.161
Just breathe.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.789
(grunts)

02:02.831 --> 02:06.042
(screaming)

02:06.084 --> 02:08.503
This is horrible.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.172
He's not gone.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.758
And neither am I.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.677
Wait.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.262
We all die?

02:17.303 --> 02:18.680
That super sucked.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.265
But remember,

02:20.306 --> 02:21.766
none of that
has happened yet.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.393
We still have a chance
to change it.

02:23.434 --> 02:24.686
Okay.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.479
We know what not to do.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.356
What we need is a tape
with a plan going forward.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.650
We have stop what we've seen.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.318
I'll get to Jordan

02:32.360 --> 02:33.820
before he meets up with Chloe.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.572
I'll intercept Kaela
before she runs

02:35.613 --> 02:36.990
into Ishani out on the road.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.992
Will you find Harry,
see if he can get

02:39.033 --> 02:42.620
any more info from that lady
in the weird-ass video store?

02:43.955 --> 02:45.790
Mel... Bee Bop murder.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.458
It was Lloyd.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.419
Well, how did you...?

02:49.460 --> 02:50.879
There's a tape.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.505
Long story.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.340
But more importantly...

02:54.382 --> 02:56.301
you were going to go to sleep
for seven years

02:56.342 --> 02:57.760
without saying goodbye.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.597
After everything
that's happened between us.

03:00.638 --> 03:03.057
I mean, I don't think
there's an inch of your office

03:03.099 --> 03:05.268
where we didn't--

03:05.310 --> 03:08.438
Kiss-and-Tell Mel strikes again.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.190
No.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.983
What happened between us
has nothing to do

03:12.025 --> 03:13.651
with my Kiss-and-Tell phase.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.321
I was not running away
from my grief with you.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.073
What we did...

03:19.115 --> 03:20.783
mattered.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.704
So...

03:24.746 --> 03:26.581
you will not go
into hibernation

03:26.623 --> 03:28.249
until we get the chance to talk.

03:48.811 --> 03:51.397
Mm, not this again.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.026
I thought we were done with the
"almost running you down" bit.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.569
Same with you
running away.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.571
Dev died.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.115
If anyone understands
what you're going through...

04:01.157 --> 04:02.909
It's not enough.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.078
I want this all
to never have happened.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.498
I want him here with me.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.625
I want that, too.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.835
For Dev. For Macy.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.587
For my mom.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.631
But we can't bring them back.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.508
And something
is happening

04:18.549 --> 04:20.760
with the Lost One
that's going

04:20.802 --> 04:23.805
to take everyone and everything
away if we don't stop it.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.682
"Everything"?

04:26.766 --> 04:28.476
So please.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.228
Just come back with me.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.522
One more time.

04:41.656 --> 04:44.534
Have you ever heard of another
world with other Charmed Ones?

04:44.575 --> 04:46.327
Even other Whitelighters?

04:46.369 --> 04:47.954
Nope.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.206
But I once took shrooms
and imagined a world

04:50.248 --> 04:52.625
where blood was mayonnaise
and chickens had ears.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.922
Well, you're in a state.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.301
I just escaped being hostage
to a woman who's either

05:01.342 --> 05:04.137
unbelievably prescient
or totally insane.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.641
Would you consider taking over

05:08.683 --> 05:10.101
the Blue Camellia
while I'm gone?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.519
Were you even listening?

05:11.561 --> 05:13.062
Yeah, I got the gist.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.647
You have your agenda.
I have mine.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.983
Look, I think we've done
right by each other,

05:17.025 --> 05:19.402
but running this place
with all its complexities?

05:19.444 --> 05:21.529
It's not my destiny.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.574
Well, what is your destiny,
Harry Greenwood?

05:24.615 --> 05:26.868
Con man to Whitelighter,
to Necrolighter,

05:26.909 --> 05:28.828
to what next?

05:28.870 --> 05:31.039
Well, if I knew that...

05:31.080 --> 05:32.665
Harry!

05:32.707 --> 05:34.125
I've been looking
everywhere.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.418
Please tell me you know
how to get back

05:35.460 --> 05:36.878
to where this tape came from.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.808
Jordan Chase...

05:50.850 --> 05:53.061
I love you.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.272
Uh, not that I mind, but, um...

05:56.314 --> 05:58.649
what prompted that?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.651
Your death.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.364
I'm tired of...

06:04.405 --> 06:05.782
worrying and wasting time

06:05.823 --> 06:07.241
and us making a mess.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.160
Maggie Vera...

06:10.745 --> 06:13.956
I love you, too.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.920
Mm.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.546
One thing.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.382
Can we go back to the part

06:22.423 --> 06:24.675
where you said, "Your death"?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.304
TROLL:
I commit myself to you...

06:28.346 --> 06:29.847
the Lost One.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.933
I commit body...

06:31.974 --> 06:33.393
and soul.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.438
LOST ONE:
The present is changing.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.399
I can feel it.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.567
We can still overcome,

06:41.609 --> 06:43.486
but you must

06:43.528 --> 06:44.695
give more.

06:44.737 --> 06:48.032
For you... anything.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.034
Everything.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.161
LOST ONE:
They think they can stop me

06:52.203 --> 06:54.831
because they know the future.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.083
But what we do next

06:57.125 --> 06:59.585
will bring them to their knees.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.678
This is super weird.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.805
For a bunch of reasons.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.351
Wha...?

07:15.393 --> 07:17.437
(gasps)

07:17.478 --> 07:19.355
Did I do that?

07:21.899 --> 07:24.485
And like a bad penny,
he's back.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.363
That's no way to greet
your former hostage, now is it?

07:28.364 --> 07:30.074
She's one who hit you over
the head with the flashlight?

07:30.116 --> 07:32.118
Had to knock sense into him.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.411
Can I trust you
not to do it again?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.912
Depends
on why you're here.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.747
Something's
become destabilized.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.375
In your world and likely
the world I come from, as well.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.626
Well, do we know that for sure?

07:40.668 --> 07:42.086
It's logical.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.338
Both of our worlds have
pathways to this place.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.592
We have to assume things will
get messed up on both sides.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.385
Something's happening.
The Day of the Fall.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.596
This isn't just that.
It's bigger.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.724
Maybe that's why the witch
from my world created

07:54.765 --> 07:56.517
this whole store
to begin with.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.853
Whatever's about to happen,
it could destroy both worlds

07:58.895 --> 08:00.313
unless we stop it.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.398
We saw on our tape
how you can get a look

08:02.440 --> 08:04.400
at what's happening right now
on one of these screens.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.527
Under ideal conditions,
sure.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.698
These are not those conditions.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.909
Let me show you how we used
to do it back in the 1970s.

08:16.245 --> 08:17.747
(exhales)

08:17.788 --> 08:19.540
Here. Give me your hand.
We'll use our bodies

08:19.582 --> 08:21.792
as the extension
of the antenna.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.253
HARRY: Good, yeah, right.
The more, the merrier.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.678
HARRY: Looks like the
location where the ceremony

08:32.720 --> 08:34.805
to raise Inara
took place.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.766
Try moving
your right foot.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.145
And this is why I spent
the last 15 years

08:41.187 --> 08:42.522
in here doing glutes.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.609
Guys...

08:49.195 --> 08:50.905
DIANA: What the hell
is he doing?

08:50.947 --> 08:54.825
I will not fail you,
I will not fail you.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.746
I will not fail you, Lost One.

08:58.788 --> 09:02.416
I will not fail you,
I will not fail you.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.960
(twigs crunch)

09:04.001 --> 09:06.754
You've got The Book of Shadows
and the Bowl, yes?

09:08.047 --> 09:09.549
We'll take it from here.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.841
What, wait, wait, no, no, no.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.843
Wait! No!

09:17.390 --> 09:20.768
This new plan, whatever it is,
you need to tell us.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.312
So what?

09:23.354 --> 09:25.189
You can stop it?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.567
You can't-- that's the glory
of what comes next.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.569
It's bigger than even
the three of you.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.030
Wait, is that...?

09:34.031 --> 09:37.034
One last gift from the Tallyman.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.413
You're not the only chosen ones.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.541
I am, too.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.626
By the Lost One.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.629
An instrument
of brutal redemption.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.257
We know how overwhelming
that can feel.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.551
Okay? But death is
not the answer.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.511
Let's get you home.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.346
I'm not going home.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.223
None of us are.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.435
One way or another...

10:02.476 --> 10:04.854
this... is

10:04.895 --> 10:07.648
our very last day on Earth.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.067
Get back. Get back!
(ticking)

10:14.071 --> 10:15.781
I cannot tell you
how tired I am of trying to get

10:15.823 --> 10:17.533
creature innards
out of my hair at night.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.452
I know. All this
pointless death.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.870
Let's focus on the positives.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.288
Without the Book or the bowl,

10:22.330 --> 10:24.081
no one can raise Inara.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.167
Except that doesn't seem to be
what she's planning anymore.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.127
Raising Inara was
supposed to bring about

10:28.169 --> 10:30.379
the disappearance of humans.
He's a troll.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.839
so what's with the whole...

10:31.881 --> 10:33.591
"This is our
very last day on Earth"?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.551
Maybe he's just flat-out crazy.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.845
You know?
(rumbling)

10:37.887 --> 10:40.139
Whoa!

10:40.181 --> 10:42.558
LOST ONE:
You're just like them.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.102
My sisters.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.730
Weak and afraid.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.939
Inara?

10:48.981 --> 10:50.983
Talk to us.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.069
We can figure
this out together.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.112
LOST ONE:
No more talk.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.281
I've waited long enough.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.992
You can lock me up,

11:00.034 --> 11:02.578
keep me from rising.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.123
But you can't stop me
from changing the world.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.250
(high-pitched ringing)
(screaming)

11:16.717 --> 11:18.803
MAGGIE:
What if Ray didn't go anywhere?

11:18.844 --> 11:21.180
These plants and trees around us
are actually...

11:21.222 --> 11:22.556
all the humans?

11:29.855 --> 11:32.316
I've been watching
what happened.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.443
So many people in pain.
We have to stop it.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.404
I know.
We're trying.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.072
We got the Unity Bowl and
The Book of Shadows back.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.073
So, good.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.533
JORDAN:
And the troll?

11:40.574 --> 11:42.368
Not so good.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.036
MEL:
And Inara has something
else up her sleeve.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.205
Worse than exterminating humans?

11:46.247 --> 11:47.581
We have to find out what it is.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.041
KAELA:
Maybe there's
some chatter

11:49.083 --> 11:50.918
by the Unseen that
could give us a clue?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.169
You okay?

11:52.211 --> 11:53.963
I just have
an intense headache.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.590
Probably from Inara's
temper tantrum in the woods.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.759
You do get headaches two days
before your period.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.261
Mine started yesterday.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.679
Yeah, Monday.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.306
I'll make you some
tea later, okay?

12:04.348 --> 12:05.766
Sisters, man.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.768
Magic's got nothing
on your connection.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.480
MAGGIE:
Sister connection.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.858
That's who we ask.
Inara's sisters.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.485
Okay. But how do we find them?

12:16.527 --> 12:18.195
On the tape.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.822
In the old timeline,

12:19.864 --> 12:22.199
Ishani's due out on the road
to meet Kaela about now.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.784
If y'all hurry,
you might catch her.

12:25.786 --> 12:26.912
You and I can go find
the Guardian.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.457
Yeah.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.212
Ishani should've
been here by now.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.089
Something's not right.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.508
Maybe because we're changing
what we're doing in the present,

12:39.550 --> 12:41.010
she's not coming
to find me.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.137
Hang on.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.391
Banana fitters, which
means Ishani was here...

12:47.433 --> 12:49.769
Hey, those look
just like my mom's...

12:49.810 --> 12:51.729
Don't do that!
Ow!

12:51.771 --> 12:53.898
They're drugged!
What?

12:53.939 --> 12:56.275
You really need
to watch that tape.

12:56.317 --> 12:59.361
If Ishani was here,
we can figure out

12:59.403 --> 13:01.572
where she went to next.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.783
Reveal the path once made.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.910
Bare your soles,
before time fades.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.714
Whoa. Nice.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.429
Poor troll actually thought
he was dying for a cause?

13:25.471 --> 13:27.681
Maggie said he went full martyr.

13:27.723 --> 13:30.017
Now the question is,
what did he know

13:30.059 --> 13:31.936
that made him want to do that?

13:31.977 --> 13:35.272
And this is how you contact the
dead, with his blood and guts?

13:36.315 --> 13:37.775
Dirty stuff, Necrolighting.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.693
You chose this path?

13:39.735 --> 13:42.363
Yeah, I did, thinking it would
lead to a happier destination.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.406
But it's proving
to be just another dead end.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.116
Maggie told me that
without your powers,

13:46.158 --> 13:48.327
Dexter would've been stuck
in the Veil.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.496
Knowing that he moved on
gave her comfort.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.832
Sounds like you helped him

13:52.873 --> 13:54.917
along on his journey.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.588
Well, let's see if I can do the
same with our troll friend here.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.728
TROLL (whispering):
Hide the book.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.856
Hide the bowl.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.941
I got the book,
I got the bowl.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.442
I got the book,

14:20.484 --> 14:22.361
I got the bowl,
I just have to...

14:22.403 --> 14:24.196
(exhales)

14:24.238 --> 14:26.657
TROLL:
What?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.117
What are you doing here?

14:28.158 --> 14:30.703
Where do you think here is?

14:33.038 --> 14:35.207
I-I don't know.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.835
The-the Lost One promised
to send me

14:37.877 --> 14:39.753
to the, the Gates of Glory.

14:39.795 --> 14:42.131
Heaven for my people.

14:42.172 --> 14:43.340
You're trapped
between the worlds

14:43.382 --> 14:44.758
of the living and the dead.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.968
What?

14:47.177 --> 14:48.637
No.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.848
No, the Lost One--
Lied.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.101
To you and everyone else.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.313
But...

14:57.354 --> 14:59.356
But he promised!

14:59.398 --> 15:01.817
Loyalty in exchange for mercy.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.694
Me.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.321
My family.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.655
She promised.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.282
What?

15:08.324 --> 15:09.992
The Lost One.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.202
She's a witch,
and not just any witch.

15:12.244 --> 15:15.122
Her name is Inara,
and she was a Charmed One.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.833
But... no...

15:17.875 --> 15:19.960
No, that's not, that's not...

15:21.337 --> 15:23.881
The Charmed Ones are
the problem.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.718
The Lost One was going
to save us from them.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.304
The problem is much bigger

15:30.346 --> 15:31.847
than three young witches
who are just trying

15:31.889 --> 15:33.682
to do the right thing.

15:33.724 --> 15:36.018
Trust me.
I know them better than anyone.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.020
And they are good people.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.689
No, no, they are
wonderful people.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.611
So...

15:45.653 --> 15:47.905
are you

15:47.947 --> 15:50.741
really angry
at them?

15:50.783 --> 15:53.911
Or just mad
about something else?

15:55.913 --> 15:58.582
Where do I even start?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.918
I'm here to listen and help.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.628
But first, please,

16:02.670 --> 16:04.880
just tell me what you know
about Inara's plan.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.216
Yeah.

16:07.257 --> 16:10.052
The, uh, the Lost One...

16:10.094 --> 16:12.680
Inara.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.974
It's the reverse
of what she did to humans.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.476
If she can't fix it,

16:17.518 --> 16:19.645
she's going to end all magic.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.355
End all magic?

16:21.397 --> 16:24.149
Yeah, either she gets her way,

16:24.191 --> 16:27.486
or trolls, witches,
demons, pixies, ogres,

16:27.528 --> 16:29.738
all of us...

16:32.241 --> 16:34.368
...we get wiped from existence.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.288
And how is she
going to do that?

16:51.468 --> 16:52.761
Am I allowed
in there?

16:52.803 --> 16:54.471
Only one way
to find out.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.098
Dona aditum.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.646
Hopefully
the Guardian's in here.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.440
(magical chime)

17:04.481 --> 17:06.275
(grunts)

17:06.316 --> 17:08.902
DEMON:
No mercy at the Punch Bowl!

17:10.571 --> 17:12.281
Demons.

17:12.322 --> 17:13.657
They have the Guardian.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.992
Where?

17:15.034 --> 17:17.077
Some place called
the Punch Bowl.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.121
We can't just waltz
in there after

17:19.163 --> 17:21.582
we spent the last year taking
out a lot of their friends.

17:21.623 --> 17:24.460
We're just gonna have
to blend in, then.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.712
Glamour powder, here we come.

17:27.713 --> 17:28.881
Oh.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.300
(loud chatter)

17:31.341 --> 17:34.219
This looks bad.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.346
(shouting, clamoring)

17:42.311 --> 17:43.645
Ishta.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.445
We have to stop this.
(growling)

17:52.404 --> 17:54.073
(snarls)

18:01.830 --> 18:03.791
JORDAN:
The hell is she doing here?

18:03.832 --> 18:05.709
Damn.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.921
All three of these sisters
are a complete mess.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.716
MEL: That's
Ishani's truck.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.802
This is the right place.
Mm.

18:17.721 --> 18:20.140
MEL: Really?
You've got to be kidding me.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.351
Well, you know
what they say.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.436
When the world's ending...

18:24.478 --> 18:26.105
just go bowling.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.857
(disco music playing)

18:30.818 --> 18:32.861
40 years together, huh?

18:32.903 --> 18:34.279
Ever considered

18:34.321 --> 18:36.115
opening things up?

18:37.032 --> 18:38.408
Auntie Ishani.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.785
There you are.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.286
I'm so sorry to
interrupt, but, um,

18:41.328 --> 18:45.040
our aunt, she left
her ointment at home.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.001
(chuckles):
No.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.712
Come on, she's joking.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.714
(sighs)

18:52.756 --> 18:53.841
Hold on.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.926
You two look kind of familiar.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.220
Have we ever...?

18:58.262 --> 18:59.721
you know.

18:59.763 --> 19:00.973
MEL:
Good God, she's drunk.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.183
Oh, you're the current ones.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.186
Belle and... Taylor?

19:06.228 --> 19:08.063
Mel and Kaela.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.565
We need your help.

19:09.606 --> 19:10.858
With Inara.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.569
Look, I've got
some magical Molly

19:13.610 --> 19:15.779
with my name on it,
and I just booked lane three,

19:15.821 --> 19:18.157
so I should probably go.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.534
This is serious. Cataclysmic.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.787
No. You know what?
Let her bowl.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.497
Let's make this
interesting.

19:26.623 --> 19:29.376
I'll join you.
If you win, we'll leave.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.086
If we win,

19:31.128 --> 19:32.379
you'll help us.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.590
Game on, sister.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.758
(chuckles)
Mm.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.594
You can bowl, right?

19:38.635 --> 19:40.429
Ish.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.432
Look, I can bowl enough
to stall for time.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.058
Let's go.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.186
(indistinct shouting)

19:49.938 --> 19:51.899
Charming outfits.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.610
We came here to help you.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.528
Does it look like I need help?

19:56.570 --> 19:58.822
No. But...

19:58.864 --> 20:00.365
This isn't you.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.327
You're the flowy dress
ethereal tree lady,

20:03.368 --> 20:05.329
not some demon
fight club champion.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.957
Sometimes the ethereal tree lady
needs to blow off some steam.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.542
Alone.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.878
Well, if you want a fight,
we have one for you.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.588
Inara.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.927
(fight bell rings)
(sighs)

20:19.968 --> 20:21.929
It's time
for my next round.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.263
Please.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.265
We stopped her from rising,

20:25.307 --> 20:26.892
but she's planning
something else.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.268
We need your help.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.979
I am done helping
or stopping my sister.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.774
She's already taken 10,000 years
from me.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.776
What if you could change that?

20:35.817 --> 20:37.861
Finally make it right?

20:38.820 --> 20:41.949
Some sisterhoods can be fixed.
Some cannot.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.076
Guess which one mine is.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.539
Okay.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.083
Now what?

20:52.584 --> 20:53.877
(fight bell rings)

20:53.919 --> 20:56.129
MAGGIE:
If you won't fight Inara,

20:56.171 --> 20:58.257
then you've got to fight me.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.259
ISHTA:
You sure

21:00.300 --> 21:01.468
you want a piece of me?

21:01.510 --> 21:04.096
If it gets you to listen, yes.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.722

Harry, please tell me
the troll gave you something.

23:31.451 --> 23:32.911
I spoke to the poor chap
for hours.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.830
He said he wanted to help
but then started ranting

23:34.871 --> 23:35.997
about the end
of everything magic

23:36.039 --> 23:37.374
and some ancient explosive.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.583
I have no idea

23:38.625 --> 23:39.626
if he was telling
the truth.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.211
Wait, an ancient explosive?

23:42.212 --> 23:44.881
You think? Mercy Days?

23:45.757 --> 23:46.967
What does that mean?

23:47.008 --> 23:49.219
"Mercy Days" is
the code name

23:49.261 --> 23:51.263
for our last-ditch effort
to destroy the Conqueror.

23:51.304 --> 23:54.057
If the Power of Three couldn't
stop him, we created a...

23:54.099 --> 23:55.600
fail-safe?

23:55.642 --> 23:57.310
More like a bomb.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.604
To destroy his magic

23:59.646 --> 24:01.189
by destroying all magic.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.649
And all who possess it.

24:02.691 --> 24:06.111
And somehow,
Inara has her hands on it?

24:07.237 --> 24:09.072
She can't rise, so she
wants to burn it all down.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.907
Herself included.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.469

24:32.179 --> 24:34.848
Blood of the oldest.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.437
And bone of the middle.
Thanks to my mom for being

24:40.479 --> 24:43.023
a crazy lady and saving every
single one of my baby teeth.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.651

firmly attached this time.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.320

24:53.200 --> 24:54.826
You're freeing a monster.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.496
One we've spent centuries
trying to keep trapped.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.039
Got a better plan?

24:59.080 --> 25:00.916
Let her rot?
She deserves it.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.375
If we let her rot away,

25:02.417 --> 25:05.170
the bomb goes off
and we all rot.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.296
You assume she cares.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.839
That she'll care
about any of us.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.217
You don't know anything
about her at all.

25:10.258 --> 25:12.552
Again, got a better plan?

25:15.138 --> 25:16.723
Okay.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.225
(breathes deeply)

25:18.266 --> 25:19.518
I'm doing this.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.862
(rumbling, howling)

25:36.576 --> 25:37.953
Mmm.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.996
Oh, wow.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.916
Ooh, it feels good
to move around.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.292
I was worried I
was gonna have

25:44.334 --> 25:47.087
a kink in my neck, but... no.

25:47.128 --> 25:51.049
It's like I was imprisoned
in that tomb only yesterday.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.426
Hello, Charmed Ones.

25:53.468 --> 25:55.428
New...

25:55.470 --> 25:57.347
and old.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.683
And I do mean old.
(inhales sharply)

25:59.724 --> 26:02.310
Time has not been kind
to you two.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.813
The whole smoky demon
bit's quite a production.

26:04.854 --> 26:07.107
Well, supplicants
like a good show. It...

26:07.148 --> 26:08.733
inspires them.

26:08.775 --> 26:11.820
Oh, there's really no need
to contain me any longer.

26:11.861 --> 26:13.446
I'm not here to fight.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.615
Oh, and we're just supposed
to trust you on that one?

26:15.657 --> 26:18.201
Now, what's the point
in fighting when the blast

26:18.243 --> 26:19.661
that's coming

26:19.703 --> 26:22.122
will end it for us all?

HARRY: Looks
like concentrated Nebron Root.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.879
Ancient, powerful and deadly.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.716
It's been placed at the
convergence of three ley lines.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.843
When it explodes,

26:34.884 --> 26:37.887
it'll follow the lines
across the earth and snap back,

26:37.929 --> 26:40.265
destroying everything magical
in its path.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.891
How much time do we have?

26:41.933 --> 26:45.186
Impossible to tell
with all that moss in the way.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.896
Which is where I come in.

26:48.815 --> 26:51.443
(magical chiming)

26:56.072 --> 26:57.657
We have minutes.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.618
Maybe less than that.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.121
There's still time
to stop this.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.915
But you know we can't
do it without you.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.793
Do you think after being
locked away for forever

27:08.835 --> 27:10.295
and a day that
I'm just gonna

27:10.337 --> 27:12.672
change my mind and save you?

27:12.714 --> 27:15.800
You have every right
to be angry with us, Inara.

27:17.177 --> 27:20.263
What we did to you was...
Unspeakable.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.099
It's haunted me every day
of my life since.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.060
We're sorry, Inara.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.564
INARA:
I get it.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.691
You need me.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.652
So now you're being nice to me.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.111
Wh-- No, no,
they were being genuine.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.155
Oh, cut the crap.
I'm not falling for it.

27:37.197 --> 27:39.157
You can burn for all I care.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.368
The more painful your deaths,
the better.

27:41.409 --> 27:42.869
ISHTA:
Seriously, Inara?

27:42.911 --> 27:44.120
Are you really
gonna be this petty?

27:44.162 --> 27:45.330
I should've known.

27:45.372 --> 27:46.790
Nothing is ever good enough

27:46.831 --> 27:47.916
for you.
Oh, please.

27:47.957 --> 27:49.042
Yeah,
you're making it real easy

27:49.084 --> 27:50.585
to move past
the guilt phase.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.128
Maybe we should have killed you
back then.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.588
And with sisters like you,

27:53.630 --> 27:55.590
maybe I should've let
the Conqueror win.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.509
Stop!

27:57.550 --> 28:00.178
You're just gonna argue
while the world burns?

28:00.220 --> 28:03.139
Please. We're not gonna listen
to lectures from you.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.350
You've already failed.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.060
Lost your real sister.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.646
Had to find... whoever she is.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.189
She's someone
who gave up her normal life

28:11.231 --> 28:13.233
to make us complete again.

28:13.274 --> 28:14.859
We've already found more

28:14.901 --> 28:16.277
in this sisterhood

28:16.319 --> 28:18.405
than you ever did
in 10,000 years.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.365
(rumbling)

28:20.407 --> 28:21.825
Is that...?

28:21.866 --> 28:23.243
Must be.

28:23.284 --> 28:26.079
We got to go. Now.
There's no point.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.247
ISHANI:
Now that it's exploded,

28:27.288 --> 28:29.040
the only way

28:29.082 --> 28:30.583
to stop it
is to take on all that energy.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.961
But that means
sacrificing yourselves.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.046
Then that's what we'll do.

28:35.088 --> 28:38.049
One way or another...

28:39.426 --> 28:41.010
...when they talk
about our legacy,

28:41.052 --> 28:43.304
it won't be our sisterhood
that ruins the world.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.737
There was nothing we could do.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.742
You should go.
There's nowhere to go.

29:03.783 --> 29:06.703
Please.
Let us handle this.

Is this really how it ends?

29:37.358 --> 29:39.152
We should've let you go
while we still could.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.782
But then I wouldn't have found
the two of you.

29:48.995 --> 29:50.371
What-what are you doing?

29:50.413 --> 29:53.082

30:02.091 --> 30:05.595

that belongs to me.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.139
Go. Now.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.099
Why are you...

30:10.141 --> 30:11.392

30:11.434 --> 30:12.977
The same reason you are.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.354
We heard you.

30:14.395 --> 30:16.981
This is our legacy.

33:04.857 --> 33:06.150
Settled.

33:06.192 --> 33:08.444
Yahtzee.

33:08.486 --> 33:09.779
(chuckles softly)

33:16.577 --> 33:18.204
(salsa music playing)

33:19.163 --> 33:21.416
The response to the next set
of affinity group meetings

33:21.457 --> 33:22.792
is totally off the charts.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.585
The first one
was so cool.

33:24.627 --> 33:26.212
(clattering)
Never thought
I'd actually see

33:26.254 --> 33:28.464
pixies and trolls
hanging out together.

33:28.506 --> 33:29.841
As friends.

33:29.882 --> 33:32.468
Could you do that more quietly?

33:32.510 --> 33:33.886
Oh. Sorry.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.763
But that's what
you get for going

33:35.805 --> 33:37.515
shot for shot
with a nine-foot-tall...

33:37.557 --> 33:38.975
whatever he was.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.476
He was a satyr,

33:40.518 --> 33:41.811
and turning down
one of their drink invitations

33:41.853 --> 33:43.896
is basically, like,
an act of war.

33:43.938 --> 33:46.315
Please, with the talking.
Could you just... softer.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.651
And kill the music. You know,

33:48.693 --> 33:50.486
when we set out to empower
the various communities,

33:50.528 --> 33:53.114
I pictured standoffs.
(music softens)

33:53.156 --> 33:55.116
Not keg stands.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.826
And we still have
a lot of work to do.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.494
It's a good start so far.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.289
In the meantime, both of you
need to stay hydrated.

34:01.330 --> 34:02.623
MEL:
Josefina,

34:02.665 --> 34:05.209
would you mind
if I talk to Maggie

34:05.251 --> 34:07.920
alone?
JOSEFINA:
Sure. I got to go.

34:07.962 --> 34:10.298
The Blue Camellia
isn't going to decorate itself.

34:10.339 --> 34:11.924
Mm.

34:14.385 --> 34:17.388
If this is about the sweater
I borrowed last night,

34:17.430 --> 34:19.474
I will buy...
No.

34:19.515 --> 34:22.435
This is not about
the sweater.

34:22.477 --> 34:23.895
(sighs)

34:28.316 --> 34:29.984
MAGGIE:
Is this...

34:30.026 --> 34:31.444
An apartment.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.821
Two-bedroom.
Beautiful.

34:33.863 --> 34:35.198
Loft style.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.824
View of the woods.

34:36.866 --> 34:38.493
How did you know about this?

34:38.534 --> 34:39.869
I ran into Jordan at SafeSpace,

34:39.911 --> 34:41.120
and he told me
you two were looking.

34:41.162 --> 34:44.332
We looked.
We're not looking.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.459
This is the apartment
of your dreams.

34:46.501 --> 34:47.919
He is the man of your dreams.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.128
Why wouldn't you
want to live there with him?

34:50.129 --> 34:51.631
You would be okay with that?

34:51.672 --> 34:53.299
Yes.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.593
I wasn't okay with you
running away from something,

34:55.635 --> 34:56.969
but if you're
running toward something...

34:58.513 --> 34:59.931
(sniffles)

35:02.183 --> 35:04.852
Thank you, Mel. I love you.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.395
I love you, too.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.773
Hey, you know what would
make me love you even more?

35:08.815 --> 35:10.024
(sighs)

35:10.066 --> 35:11.400
If you made me breakfast.

35:11.442 --> 35:12.777
Mm.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.655
(chuckles):
Please. I'm so hungover.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.579
(footsteps approaching)

35:25.998 --> 35:28.167
Another letter to Macy?

35:30.545 --> 35:33.381
No. No, this one is to myself.

35:33.422 --> 35:34.674
Hmm.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.390
A burn bowl.

35:42.431 --> 35:44.225
On one slip of paper,
you write down

35:44.267 --> 35:46.060
all the things
you no longer want to carry.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.688
Regrets, fears, traumas.

35:48.729 --> 35:50.439
And on another slip
of paper,

35:50.481 --> 35:52.400
you write the things
you want...

35:52.441 --> 35:53.943
you want to happen.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.154
Or maybe
just how you want to feel.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.241
And then

36:00.283 --> 36:02.368
you carry that with you...

36:04.871 --> 36:06.581
...as a reminder to make it so.

36:06.622 --> 36:08.416
What's on your list?

36:10.793 --> 36:12.461
Stop obsessing over the dead

36:12.503 --> 36:14.755
and start helping the living
with my new powers.

36:17.049 --> 36:18.467
I'm gonna meet with the family

36:18.509 --> 36:20.970
of the troll I spoke to
in the Veil.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.763
He shared some things with me.

36:22.805 --> 36:24.849
I think it might help them
get closure.

36:24.891 --> 36:27.894
Remember him in a way
that brings them happiness

36:27.935 --> 36:29.020
instead of more pain.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.982
I'm proud of you, Mr. Greenwood.

36:34.942 --> 36:36.611
Thank you.
(soft chuckle)

36:39.614 --> 36:41.657
What about you?

36:42.617 --> 36:45.286
Gonna keep doing this
Whitelighter thing but...

36:46.621 --> 36:47.997
...my way.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.749
Which means?

36:51.292 --> 36:53.002
Not just helping witches.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.170
I want to use

36:54.212 --> 36:55.755
my healing powers to help

36:55.796 --> 36:58.341
anyone in the magical community
who needs me.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.511
I'm proud of you, Mr. Chase.

37:03.429 --> 37:05.348
Cheers.

37:13.272 --> 37:15.942
Hey. Where have you been?

37:15.983 --> 37:17.818
Painting in
the back shed.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.779
Ever since I set up
my studio out there,

37:19.820 --> 37:22.657
the art has just been
pouring out of me.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.700
How are you not hungover?

37:24.742 --> 37:28.496
Oh, I definitely made Josefina
water down all of my drinks.

37:29.455 --> 37:31.874

37:33.834 --> 37:35.378
Yeah.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.394
Yeah, as we just saw, it...

38:33.436 --> 38:36.605
didn't work out so well.
Well...

Yeah.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.693
A pain in the butt? Sure.

38:40.735 --> 38:43.404
But it did work out.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.906
They're gone, and we're here.

38:45.948 --> 38:47.700
It's fate.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.243
