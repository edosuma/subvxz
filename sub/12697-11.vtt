WEBVTT

00:04.472 --> 00:07.408
Harper, I need you
to take this seriously.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.911
Do you have any fours?

00:11.011 --> 00:12.713
Freddie, just go fish.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.215
She's waiting to hear
about the job

00:14.315 --> 00:15.749
[whispers]:
with Double Dutch.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.885
Don't say her name!
You'll jinx me.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.321
-Who's Double Dutch?
-What did I just say?

00:20.421 --> 00:23.191
The aforementioned is
an emerging pop star

00:23.291 --> 00:25.393
with a million
Instagram followers.

00:25.493 --> 00:28.296
She's got the blue check.

00:28.396 --> 00:29.997
Oh, so she's
not real world famous,

00:30.098 --> 00:31.232
she's just online famous.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.400
-Hey!
-Hey!

00:32.500 --> 00:33.801
Before you're a household name,

00:33.901 --> 00:35.903
-you're a handheld name.
-Yeah.

00:36.003 --> 00:38.739
And handheld names can have long
and fulfilling careers...

00:38.839 --> 00:41.142
dressing up as tacos on
their wildly popular Web shows.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.676
[chuckles]

00:42.776 --> 00:44.645
Oh, that reminds me,
we're doing that sketch later.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.181
I got to go pick up my Taco Tina
costume from the cleaners.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.549
Uh, do you need to borrow
my car?

00:48.649 --> 00:51.219
No. I have my own car,
thank you.

00:51.319 --> 00:53.587
-Or you could take mine.
-[HARPER]: I don't have a car,

00:53.687 --> 00:56.056
but I can call you
an ethical rideshare company,

00:56.157 --> 00:58.192
as soon as there is one.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.893
Look, my car is fine.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.596
So what if it goes
[imitates car straining]

01:02.696 --> 01:04.298
when I'm going uphill?

01:05.032 --> 01:07.735
If I have to walk uphill,
I make that noise, too.

01:07.835 --> 01:11.872
It doesn't mean that
there's anything wrong.

01:11.972 --> 01:15.008
[beeping]

01:17.511 --> 01:19.747
* *

01:35.229 --> 01:36.264
[needle scratches record]

01:36.364 --> 01:37.798
Hi, I'm Wes.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.033
Uh, I hope you didn't wait
too long.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.403
I, I would hate for you
to get soggy.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.272
[chuckles]:
Oh, this?

01:44.372 --> 01:46.006
It's just
for a silly Internet thing.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.941
I'm Taco Tina.

01:48.041 --> 01:51.111
I'm a taco, but I have all the
same problems as any other girl.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.613
Including car troubles?

01:52.713 --> 01:54.315
Uh, 'cause according
to Quadruple A,

01:54.415 --> 01:56.284
you've called a tow truck nine
times in the last six months.

01:56.384 --> 01:59.253
What? No,
I'm sure it's not that many.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.155
Uh, really? 'Cause you get
the tenth tow for free.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.991
Oh, yeah, you know,
i-it has been nine.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.761
This guy here is Vin Diesel,

02:07.861 --> 02:10.063
'cause he has a VIN number
and he takes diesel.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.665
He takes unleaded.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.201
You haven't been putting diesel
in this car, have you?

02:13.301 --> 02:14.235
No.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.069
Definitely not.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.473
He probably just needs
a new battery.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.309
No, your battery's fine.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.544
But your drum brakes are shot,
you have a failed generator,

02:23.644 --> 02:25.213
and there's a crack
in the engine block.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.947
Oh, is that all?

02:27.047 --> 02:28.216
[chuckles]:
Oh, you wish.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.617
You have a fried distributor,

02:29.717 --> 02:31.084
and that air filter is
an environmental hazard.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.187
No, that's fine.
I wiped it off last year.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.256
Trust me. I've been doing this
since I was six,

02:35.356 --> 02:37.157
and I've been fixing Hot Wheels
since I was two.

02:37.258 --> 02:40.194
Okay, but you don't know
how tough Vin Diesel is.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.996
I've had him forever,
and he's always pulled through.

02:43.096 --> 02:46.267
Be honest,
you're just trying to upsell me.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.935
If you want me to be honest,

02:48.035 --> 02:49.870
you might want to think about
getting rid of this old clunker.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.073
The repairs are gonna cost more
than Mr. Diesel's even worth.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.009
Worth? Worth?!

02:56.109 --> 02:59.613
Can you put a price on
the perfect drive-through Coke,

02:59.713 --> 03:02.350
drunk beneath the stars
on a crisp autumn evening?

03:02.450 --> 03:03.951
Yes.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.086
And so can most fast food
restaurants.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.722
Uh, should we just go back
to your place?

03:08.822 --> 03:10.991
[chuckles]:
My place?

03:11.091 --> 03:12.426
That's presumptuous.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.162
Your place, as in the place
I'm towing your car.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.164
I presume.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.067
* I know *

03:20.167 --> 03:21.469
* You see *

03:21.569 --> 03:23.871
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

03:23.971 --> 03:26.940
* And be so wonderful *

03:27.040 --> 03:30.711
* So wake up
the members of my nation *

03:30.811 --> 03:32.913
* It's your time to be *

03:33.013 --> 03:35.949
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

03:36.049 --> 03:38.652
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

03:38.752 --> 03:41.922
* Of every situation *

03:42.022 --> 03:43.857
* Some things are meant to be *

03:43.957 --> 03:47.495
* So give your best
and leave the rest to me. *

03:48.662 --> 03:50.964
$15,000 to fix a car?

03:51.064 --> 03:53.267
You could get one-third
of a Birkin bag for that.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.935
Purses cost that much?

03:55.035 --> 03:57.805
Great, now you got me
thinking about purses,

03:57.905 --> 03:59.773
which is reminding me
of the styling job with Dutch,

03:59.873 --> 04:01.575
which I'm trying
not to think about.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.010
You brought up the purse!

04:03.110 --> 04:05.679
Oh! So now we're blaming
the victim?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.681
Thank you, Fredward.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.151
I wish there was a way to know
if my car really needed

04:11.251 --> 04:13.287
all that work
or if that mechanic was just

04:13.387 --> 04:14.555
trying to take advantage
of me.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.256
You could take
a auto repair class.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.726
I saw a flyer for one
at the community college.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.694
I was there
for my investing class.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.696
[chuckles]:
Investing! Great!

04:22.796 --> 04:25.933
Now I'm thinking about this.
Wow, Millicent.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.637
You know, I love this idea.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.972
I can take a car repair class,
fix Vin Diesel,

04:32.072 --> 04:33.941
and then talk about it
on iCarly.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.411
I can't be the only woman who's
sick of condescending mechanics.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.912
Hey, it's not just women.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.782
When I got my oil changed,
it cost an extra $400

04:41.882 --> 04:43.784
to fix my "shock exacerbater."

04:43.884 --> 04:45.185
What's a shock exacerbater?

04:45.285 --> 04:48.422
It is a made-up thing
that cost $400.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.391
Well, they're gonna be naming
made-up auto parts after me

04:50.491 --> 04:52.993
once I ace this class
like Hermione freaking Granger.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.895
Hermione Freaking Granger
was the title

04:54.995 --> 04:56.664
of Dutch's first album!

04:56.764 --> 04:58.932
Come on, Carly!

05:01.669 --> 05:04.372
-[chuckles]
-[sniffs] Ah, vino.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.839
The serum of truth.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.908
But we already know
every single thing

05:08.008 --> 05:09.610
there is to know
about each other. [chuckles]

05:09.710 --> 05:12.045
I faked it!

05:12.846 --> 05:14.715
What? Last night?

05:14.815 --> 05:16.384
All of it.
The whole time.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.618
Since I've known you?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.620
Since before that.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.423
Guess that makes me feel
a little bit better.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.493
I just couldn't keep
lying to you a moment longer.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.529
Oh, please don't be upset.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.731
I'm more disappointed
in myself.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.566
Is there anything
I could've done better?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.768
More wiggling?
I-I'm here to listen.

05:34.868 --> 05:38.839
Spencer,
I faked my own kidnapping.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.941
[chuckling]:
Oh, thank God.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.710
It's not me, it's you!

05:42.810 --> 05:44.645
Okay. Why'd you do that?

05:44.745 --> 05:46.580
When our family lost
all of our money,

05:46.680 --> 05:48.649
I was being hounded
by the paparazzi,

05:48.749 --> 05:51.251
bill collectors, the media--

05:51.351 --> 05:53.286
mostly bill collectors.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.856
So I hopped on a cruise
and sailed away.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.926
Suddenly it's all like,
"kidnapping this"

05:59.026 --> 06:01.629
and "debt forgiveness" that,
so...

06:01.729 --> 06:02.996
Wow.

06:03.797 --> 06:07.435
Now we're even closer
than before! Yay!

06:07.535 --> 06:09.336
You're not mad?

06:09.437 --> 06:11.672
As long as you were never
a rodeo clown, we're fine.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.273
[laughs]

06:13.373 --> 06:14.708
Well, that's great.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.244
Do you think Harper
will understand?

06:17.344 --> 06:19.346
No.
[laughs] No.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.615
She's gonna kill you
and bury you at sea.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.885
I'll lay fresh kelp
at your grave.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.726
Wow, look at all these women.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.395
And you. And that guy.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.898
A camaraderie of sisterhood,
joining hands to say,

06:37.998 --> 06:39.567
"We can fix it ourselves."

06:39.667 --> 06:41.234
I'm gonna start
taking notes now.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.571
You know where class starts,
Millicent?

06:43.671 --> 06:44.705
In here.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.807
That's your clavicle.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.876
I just can't wait to learn

06:48.976 --> 06:50.978
everything there is
to know about cars.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.747
I truly am a renaissance person.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.082
But most importantly,

06:55.182 --> 06:56.917
I'm gonna get Vin Diesel
in tip-top shape.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.488
MTV Movie Award winner
for Best Tank Top Vin Diesel?

07:00.588 --> 07:02.790
He's in perfect shape.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.593
Oh, my car's name is Vin Diesel.

07:05.693 --> 07:10.430
Yesterday, this guy tried to
charge me $15,000 for repairs.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.999
Ugh, the worst.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.367
But you're gonna love
the instructor of this class.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.203
He is so patient and smart,

07:16.303 --> 07:18.305
and when he shows you
how to do a tune-up,

07:18.405 --> 07:21.842
it's almost... tender.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.310
As long as he's honest.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.546
I just can't take
another skeezy scammer,

07:25.646 --> 07:27.047
like that guy I met yesterday.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.817
Skeezy scammer?
Sounds like a jerk.

07:29.917 --> 07:33.521
Yeah, he sure w-- Aah! You.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.723
Hi. Welcome to class, everyone.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.358
Ooh, twinsies.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.566
This is your shop?

07:45.666 --> 07:47.467
Yes.
Uh, it was my grandfather's

07:47.568 --> 07:49.236
and then my father's
and now mine.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.604
Cars run in the family.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.940
So you earned none of this.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.775
Oh, Regina.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.409
Hey, it-it's great
to see you again.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.711
If you take this class
any more times,

07:57.811 --> 07:58.946
you're gonna be
the one teaching it.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.313
Can I take a picture of you?

08:00.413 --> 08:02.583
Okay, class, let's go ahead
and get started.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.284
You know, this class is a sham.

08:04.384 --> 08:05.986
You're giving people false hope.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.321
'Cause then, when they realize
they can't fix their own cars,

08:08.421 --> 08:10.824
they're gonna crawl back to you
and then you can swindle them.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.660
It's just like one of
those restaurants

08:12.760 --> 08:15.195
that gives you free chips
and then charges a ton for guac.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.264
Is that one of
Taco Tina's troubles?

08:18.532 --> 08:19.533
That's not
what's happening here, okay?

08:19.633 --> 08:21.068
I-I just like to empower people

08:21.168 --> 08:23.136
so that they don't need
someone like me to come in

08:23.236 --> 08:24.905
and "vansplain."

08:25.005 --> 08:26.206
[laughs]

08:26.306 --> 08:27.908
Vansplain!

08:28.008 --> 08:31.011
No matter how many times I hear
that, it just gets funnier.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.681
Lady, be cool.

08:33.781 --> 08:35.549
First thing I want
to teach you all is

08:35.649 --> 08:37.785
how to monitor
your vehicle's fluids.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.554
So who wants to come up
and help me check the oil?

08:41.421 --> 08:43.957
Please, God,
I never ask for anything.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.993
How about you, Carly?

08:46.093 --> 08:47.828
[others groan]

08:47.928 --> 08:49.196
Fine.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.231
I was just trying to give
someone else a chance,

08:51.331 --> 08:53.033
since I already know
how to do all this,

08:53.133 --> 08:55.936
but I suppose I can demonstrate
for the good of my peers.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.370
Great.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.507
Then reach on down in
and grab the dipstick.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.943
-Seriously?
-I didn't name it.

09:03.911 --> 09:04.978
Not it.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.080
I know.
I was just testing you.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.982
Good job. You passed.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.953
Here, let me just help.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.188
Look, I can do it myself.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.223
[screams]

09:16.323 --> 09:18.859
[chuckles]

09:18.959 --> 09:20.694
Okay, class.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.563
Who can tell me
what Carly did wrong?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.904
If this doesn't put Harper
in the right mood

09:31.004 --> 09:33.140
to hear bad news,
I don't know what will.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.543
I snagged the limited edition
Normani Off Balance sneakers

09:36.644 --> 09:37.577
she's been coveting.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.413
You wear them on your hands.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.617
And I got this $2,000 bottle
of champagne.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.886
I bought it at an estate sale
of someone who went bankrupt

09:45.986 --> 09:48.756
buying $2,000 bottles
of champagne.

09:48.856 --> 09:53.260
And I framed this photo of
our least favorite cousin Roxy.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.665
No matter what I do, I'll always
look better in comparison.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.300
-Go to hell, Roxy.
-[door lock clicks]

10:00.400 --> 10:02.602
[gasps] She's here.

10:06.006 --> 10:09.076
Hold up.
Flowers? Bubbly?

10:09.176 --> 10:13.213
[gasps] Limited edition
Normani Off Balance sneakers!

10:13.313 --> 10:15.582
You wear them on your hands.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.819
You two did all this for me?

10:18.919 --> 10:23.356
We did, because we love you,
and we need to tell you...

10:23.456 --> 10:25.826
How happy you are that I got the
styling job with Double Dutch?

10:25.926 --> 10:28.561
[giggles] Wait.
How did you two already hear?

10:28.662 --> 10:30.530
[BOTH]:
You got the job?

10:31.031 --> 10:32.232
You got the job!

10:32.332 --> 10:33.867
-[squealing]
-[cheering]

10:33.967 --> 10:37.404
Oh! There's even a picture
of Roxy,

10:37.504 --> 10:40.473
to remind me
that I'm doing better than her.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.143
My L-F-C-U-M-E-B-M.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.712
L-F-C-U-M-E-B-M?

10:44.812 --> 10:47.781
Least favorite cousin
unless Maeve ever betrays me.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.720
Back from the dumb
auto mechanic class

10:52.820 --> 10:55.222
that I'm never going back to.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.058
Flowers? Bubbly?

10:58.158 --> 11:01.762
Normani Off Balance sneakers
that you wear on your hands?

11:01.862 --> 11:05.733
-You got the job! Oh, my God!
-[squealing] Yes! Come here!

11:05.833 --> 11:07.100
Oh, yay!

11:07.200 --> 11:08.936
[all cheering]

11:09.036 --> 11:11.271
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.506
Okay, okay. Okay.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.008
Now that we're all
in such a good mood,

11:15.108 --> 11:17.745
Maeve has something
she'd like to say.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.848
Harper,
I just want you to know...

11:21.448 --> 11:22.750
...I am so happy for you!

11:22.850 --> 11:24.617
-[cheering]
-[laughing]

11:24.718 --> 11:26.619
Oh, you know what we need?

11:26.720 --> 11:28.055
A champagne shower.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.490
No, no, no!
That bottle cost more than my...

11:30.590 --> 11:32.192
Oh, I actually have
a strategy meeting

11:32.292 --> 11:33.761
with Double Dutch in the studio,
so I can't celebrate right now.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.162
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's smart.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.930
Who do we think we are,
the Chicago Bulls?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.799
-[chuckling]
-So, no champy shou shou?

11:38.899 --> 11:41.101
Oh, no, go ahead,
just don't get any on me.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.070
Oh, yeah, do Spencer.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.138
-[mouths]
-Yas!

11:45.238 --> 11:49.142
[whooping, laughing]

11:55.082 --> 11:56.449
New plan.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.518
We never tell Harper
I faked my kidnapping.

11:58.618 --> 11:59.920
I don't want to be
the new Roxy.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.356
Fantastic. We go on
happily living our lives.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.092
You and I in romantic bliss,

12:05.192 --> 12:08.228
and Harper working her dream job
with Double Dutch.

12:08.328 --> 12:13.666
* Did somebody say my name? *

12:14.601 --> 12:18.839
* I'm gonna hop,
skip, jump right over *

12:18.939 --> 12:23.777
* You guys have
a lot of yogurt. *

12:23.877 --> 12:25.545
-Are you...?
-Double Dutch?

12:25.645 --> 12:28.548
The singer/producer/cult icon,

12:28.648 --> 12:30.884
once described by Pitchfork as

12:30.984 --> 12:33.186
"the most innovative star
to be born

12:33.286 --> 12:35.122
in the year 1994."

12:35.222 --> 12:38.125
No shade to Bieber,
but where is the lie?

12:38.225 --> 12:41.128
Yes. C'est moi.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.762
In the flesh.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.799
I'm here for my strategy meeting
with Harper.

12:45.899 --> 12:49.302
I guess, uh, on-the-rise
pop stars don't knock.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.737
We don't.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.439
But tell me about
this fake kidnapping.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.007
And use a three-act structure,

12:54.107 --> 12:56.476
a proper hero's journey,
if you will.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.278
Uh, or, or...

12:58.378 --> 13:01.214
how about none of us speak
a word about the kidnapping?

13:01.314 --> 13:02.850
Oh, I won't speak a word.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.117
Okay.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.253
But I do love to sing.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.156
[giggles]

13:10.057 --> 13:13.026
* Harper's cousin faked
her own kidnapping *

13:13.126 --> 13:17.130
* Harper's cousin
faked her own kidnapping. *

13:17.230 --> 13:18.631
Okay, plan A,

13:18.731 --> 13:20.667
I somehow keep Double Dutch
from spilling the beans.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.435
Oh, well, then what's plan B?

13:22.535 --> 13:24.271
We go to Honduras

13:24.371 --> 13:26.907
under the names
Terrence and Felicity Tacoma.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.910
We settle in the small town
of La Esperanza.

13:30.677 --> 13:31.811
We grow peaches

13:31.912 --> 13:33.947
and teach basket-weaving
to the children.

13:34.714 --> 13:38.886
I like peaches,
but let's start with plan A.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.058
I don't trust that Wes,
and I don't need that class.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.260
I already have the greatest
teacher in the world:

13:47.360 --> 13:48.495
the Internet.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.130
If I can install
my own ceiling fan,

13:50.230 --> 13:52.099
I can tune up my car.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.533
Great idea, Carly.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.904
I'm sure a 30-second TikTok
can fix this death trap.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.106
Millicent might have a point.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.975
Freddie, just hand me that,
uh, twisty thingy.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.678
-Okay. This is no big deal.
-All right.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.680
-[torquing, thump]
-[Carly shouts]

14:07.780 --> 14:09.716
-No! Ah. No.
-Whoa. Hey! I got you!

14:09.816 --> 14:11.885
-[whimpers]
-Come on.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.887
-Son of a...!
-[horn honks]

14:14.955 --> 14:16.823
You know what?
That's okay.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.025
I've almost got it.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.492
Freddie,
go check the spark plugs.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.694
-All right.
-Millicent, start him up!

14:21.794 --> 14:23.530
[engine struggles]

14:23.630 --> 14:25.032
-[electrical crackling]
-Oh! [yells]

14:25.132 --> 14:26.399
[horn honks]

14:26.499 --> 14:27.901
Millicent, stop that!

14:28.001 --> 14:31.138
Then you two stop cussing.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.373
Ooh!

14:33.473 --> 14:36.309
Okay. I've got it.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.647
Wow. Should I start
my own auto shop?

14:40.747 --> 14:42.415
[clattering]

14:42.515 --> 14:45.318
No, no, no, no!

14:45.418 --> 14:46.987
Vin Diesel, are you okay?

14:47.087 --> 14:48.956
Carly, you need to call
a real mechanic.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.124
-Never in a million...
-[rumbling]

14:53.961 --> 14:57.797
-Hand me my phone.
-Okay. Hold this.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.873
Vin Diesel is dying,
and I need you to save him.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.475
I don't care how much it costs.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.443
I'll buy every shock exacerbater
in this town if I have to.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.245
Carly, I told you
when we first met,

15:12.345 --> 15:13.913
you shouldn't be driving
this car, okay?

15:14.014 --> 15:15.148
It-it isn't safe.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.249
Why don't you just get
a new one?

15:16.349 --> 15:17.917
Because I...

15:18.018 --> 15:19.752
I just can't, okay?

15:19.852 --> 15:21.421
I can't give up on this car.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.689
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.457
-And called me names.
-Yes. Right.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.758
And should've listened to me
from the start.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.660
Oh. True, I know,
that's why I called you.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.097
I am sorry
for all those things.

15:30.197 --> 15:33.166
But I am begging you,
Wes, please,

15:33.266 --> 15:35.868
will you save Vin Diesel?

15:36.869 --> 15:38.771
Okay. I will try.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.541
I'm gonna need you
to do more than try.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.645
[chuckles]: Actually,
trying's fine. You do you.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.248
Thank you, Wes.
[chuckles]

15:48.348 --> 15:49.949
But do it.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.686
The birds represent capitalism.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.056
And the white woman
represents...

15:56.156 --> 15:57.490
well, nothing.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.426
-She's just having a bad day.
-Mm-mm.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.261
No birds.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.231
If I can't fly,
no one should be allowed to.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.233
[elevator bell dings]

16:08.135 --> 16:11.404
Who's ready for teatime?

16:12.372 --> 16:13.873
Spencer, what are you doing?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.408
Oh, I just thought
you and Dutch might enjoy

16:15.508 --> 16:17.044
a formal tea service.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.412
And you were right. Give me
one of them hot hand towels.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.314
-Ooh.
-Oh, anything for you, Harper,

16:21.414 --> 16:23.183
and your boss,
whose voice is

16:23.283 --> 16:25.018
like a classically-trained
instrument

16:25.118 --> 16:26.586
that she should rest,

16:26.686 --> 16:28.088
which is why I brought the tea.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.689
Ooh. No, thank you.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.025
I don't like beverages that
start with the letter "T."

16:32.125 --> 16:34.494
I'm looking at you, tonic water.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.364
Okay. Thank you, Spencer. Bye.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.831
[grunts]:
No!

16:40.567 --> 16:42.969
This look represents
the struggle between...

16:43.070 --> 16:45.505
[loud banging]

16:46.506 --> 16:49.909
...me and Spencer, apparently.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.579
What is happening and why?

16:52.679 --> 16:55.848
Oh. I just need to do
a few repairs in here.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.317
Is that disruptive?

16:57.417 --> 17:00.120
Yeah, why don't you
just stop the presentation

17:00.220 --> 17:02.089
and then email the slides
to Dutch.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.690
Who else loves this idea?

17:03.790 --> 17:05.158
I don't.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.859
I would like the hammering
to stop

17:06.959 --> 17:10.963
and for the presentation
to continue but better.

17:12.899 --> 17:15.702
Get out. Now.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.970
[chuckles]:
All right. Okay.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.873
Oh, no! Oh! [groans]

17:20.973 --> 17:22.675
I guess I should stay
and clean this up.

17:22.775 --> 17:26.079
-Oh.
-How's it going in here?

17:26.179 --> 17:28.248
I spilled the tea.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.450
Oh, Spencer. [stammers]

17:30.550 --> 17:33.553
Harper, I am so sorry
that I faked my kidnapping,

17:33.653 --> 17:35.855
but at least now you know.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.790
You what?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.360
Oh. You meant...

17:40.460 --> 17:41.728
If you'd let me sing it,

17:41.828 --> 17:43.930
at least you would've gotten
a hit out of it.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.802
It's only been three hours

17:49.902 --> 17:51.571
of waiting on Wes
to fix Vin Diesel.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.541
How did you handle waiting
four years for Maeve?

17:54.641 --> 17:57.410
By doing everything I could
to find that betrayer.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.246
You know what, yeah,
that's a good idea.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.747
Keep busy.
Give me some more ideas.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.583
Okay. I took out ads
in the newspaper,

18:03.683 --> 18:06.686
I made the hashtag
"Save Maeve" go viral,

18:06.786 --> 18:09.789
I even recorded a charity single
that went to number 27

18:09.889 --> 18:13.293
on the iTunes chart
for songs about missing cousins.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.228
I don't want to do
any of that.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.763
[knocking]

18:17.730 --> 18:19.199
Okay.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.933
Give it to me straight.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.302
Did he make it?

18:22.402 --> 18:25.205
I did everything I could,
but I'm sorry.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.106
Vin Diesel's gone.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.875
-[gasps] Oh, no.
-Oh.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.511
-Oh, my God.
-Carly, stay with me.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.780
Just because he's gone
doesn't mean you are, too.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.215
[gasping]

18:35.315 --> 18:36.649
I just can't believe it.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.385
I mean, he was only 50.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.686
We never even got to take

18:39.786 --> 18:41.154
that cross-country
road trip together

18:41.254 --> 18:42.789
that we always talked about.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.326
Uh, hey,
I might be overstepping here,

18:46.426 --> 18:49.196
but could this be about more
than just a car?

18:49.996 --> 18:53.433
It's okay, you can tell me.
Mechanic-client privilege.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.969
My best friend Sam
and I saved up

18:57.069 --> 18:59.439
and bought Vin Diesel together
when I was in college.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.541
She's actually the one
who named him.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.411
We went everywhere in that car.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.546
Road trips to Snoqualmie Falls,

19:06.646 --> 19:09.716
the exotic jerky emporium
over the border in Idaho,

19:09.816 --> 19:12.819
out to the forest
to search for bigfoot.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.054
-Did you ever find him?
-Uh, it's a long story.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.724
[whispers]:
But yes.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.261
A couple years ago,
Sam moved away,

19:21.361 --> 19:22.895
and I just really miss her.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.832
But whenever I'm
inside Vin Diesel, I...

19:25.932 --> 19:28.768
Okay, I'm just gonna say
"my car" from now on.

19:28.868 --> 19:33.940
Driving my car, it just
helps me feel connected to Sam.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.342
I know it sounds silly.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.477
No, it's not.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.178
What's silly is having
a connection

19:39.279 --> 19:40.947
and not appreciating it.

19:41.047 --> 19:44.717
What's silly is lying
to someone for years

19:44.817 --> 19:46.619
and then telling the truth
to your brand-new boyfriend

19:46.719 --> 19:48.855
before your best friend/cousin!

19:48.955 --> 19:50.657
What's silly...

19:53.726 --> 19:56.463
...is faking
your own kidnapping.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.899
Like, who does that?
Maeve, that's who.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.401
Maeve.

20:05.905 --> 20:09.108
So, there's, like, a whole
other thing going on here.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.578
Mind your business.

20:13.112 --> 20:16.182
Anyway, thanks
for trying to save my car.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.751
Uh, here. Let me see.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.787
-How much do I owe you?
-No. Nothing.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.755
Put it toward your new car.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.991
I don't know.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.360
I wasn't really driving
a whole lot lately anyway.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.530
That...
[imitates car straining]

20:30.630 --> 20:32.131
...gets a little tired.

20:32.899 --> 20:36.736
Uh, well,
maybe you don't need a car.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.205
For example, if you had a date
on Saturday night,

20:39.306 --> 20:42.008
I bet he would be totally happy
to come pick you up.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.910
A hypothetical date?

20:44.010 --> 20:46.579
Well, where is he
hypothetically taking me?

20:46.679 --> 20:50.650
Anywhere you
hypothetically want to go.

20:54.854 --> 20:59.292
I believe it was Sir Edmond
Dellingsworth who said,

20:59.392 --> 21:01.694
-"What is a circle?"
-Boo!

21:01.794 --> 21:03.696
Lose the sheet already.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.231
All right, all right.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.367
I just wanted to say something
with some gravitas.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.470
Behold my latest piece!

21:11.504 --> 21:12.405
Wow.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.640
[gasps]

21:13.740 --> 21:15.442
Is this Vin Diesel?

21:15.542 --> 21:16.843
Yep!

21:16.943 --> 21:18.778
I took Carly's old car,
repainted him,

21:18.878 --> 21:21.481
and turned it into a new
Seat of Sitting for the studio.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.015
Try saying that five times fast.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.817
[OTHERS]: New Seat of Sitting
for the studio.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.519
New Seat of Sitting
for the studio.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.920
New Seat
of Sitting for the studio.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.322
New Seat of Sitting
for the studio.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.657
New Seat
of Sitting for the studio.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.359
Yeah, not that hard, dude.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.827
Oh, my God.
Spencer, this is amazing.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.028
Aw.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.531
My car and I had
so many good memories,

21:38.631 --> 21:39.899
and now we get to make more.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.671
Our secret gum wad's
still there.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.606
-Ew.
-Ew.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.307
Sam used this once
to keep our seat belts together.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.909
And another time I used it

21:50.009 --> 21:51.944
to keep my toes apart
after a pedicure.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.416
You know, um,
Carly getting a second chance

21:56.516 --> 21:59.519
with her car is making me
a little jealous.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.621
Oh, 'cause all our cars
got repossessed

22:01.721 --> 22:03.055
when we lost our money.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.324
Well, thanks for ruining
this special moment.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.726
I'm sad now.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.562
No, because she gets
to make more memories.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.731
And I want that for us.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.866
Harper, I am so sorry
I didn't tell you.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.435
I just didn't know how.

22:15.535 --> 22:20.607
If it means anything,
"Save Maeve" was my ringtone.

22:20.707 --> 22:24.143
It was
a tastefully mournful bop.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.849
[BOTH]:
* Be brave for Maeve *

22:29.949 --> 22:32.184
* She's lost,
not gone forever *

22:32.284 --> 22:34.320
* I'll search across
the waves *

22:34.421 --> 22:36.355
* Hope she's not in a grave *

22:36.456 --> 22:38.157
* Save Maeve. *

22:38.257 --> 22:39.792
[giggle]
