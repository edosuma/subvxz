WEBVTT

00:02.458 --> 00:03.667
Hey, Charlie.

00:03.750 --> 00:05.834
Well, I'm about to go off to college.

00:05.917 --> 00:09.917
So it's time to make my last video diary.

00:10.041 --> 00:13.125
Man, it seems like just yesterday
I was doing the first one of these.

00:13.208 --> 00:15.750
Spencer was coming over for a study date,

00:15.834 --> 00:18.500
and you were covered in smushed bananas.

00:18.583 --> 00:22.583
And, uh, yeah.
Now I'm packing for college.

00:22.667 --> 00:24.542
I'm gonna have a going-away party.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.166
And, uh...

00:27.792 --> 00:29.792
I have absolutely no idea
what else to say.

00:31.583 --> 00:35.000
You know, sometimes, at this point,
funny things just happen behind me.

00:35.083 --> 00:37.333
Hey, Swiss cheese.

00:37.417 --> 00:40.709
You know, if we were in Switzerland,
we'd just call this cheese.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.083
And sometimes they don't.

00:45.333 --> 00:46.792
Oh, good! Here's Dad.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.709
Wow! Don't hear those words very often.

00:50.375 --> 00:52.625
I'm trying to make my last video diary.

00:52.959 --> 00:54.458
Wow, your last one?

00:54.542 --> 00:55.834
That's a lot of pressure.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.458
I'm aware of that.

00:57.542 --> 00:59.166
Better be a good one.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.208
I'm trying!

01:01.458 --> 01:03.375
- Oh! Hey, Gabe.
- Mm.

01:03.458 --> 01:05.375
Teddy: He's always good for some laughs.

01:05.458 --> 01:06.667
Say something, Gabe.

01:06.750 --> 01:07.834
Hey.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.250
"Hey"? That's all you got?

01:13.166 --> 01:14.542
What's going on?

01:14.625 --> 01:16.542
Teddy's trying to do
her final video diary.

01:16.625 --> 01:19.041
Wow. Your final video diary?

01:19.125 --> 01:21.041
Ohh. Better be a good one.

01:21.125 --> 01:22.542
I know!

01:23.625 --> 01:25.250
Hey, Canadian bacon.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.583

Hi, Amy.

02:24.208 --> 02:25.667
Come on in, Debbie.

02:26.458 --> 02:29.458
Another mix-up by the mailman.

02:29.542 --> 02:31.750
He gave us Charlie's "Gurgles" magazine.

02:31.834 --> 02:35.333
Oh, that's, uh, that's PJ's,
but thank you.

02:37.083 --> 02:40.542
Ohh! Good morning Denver,
my favorite show.

02:40.625 --> 02:42.250
Are you just saying that
because I'm on it?

02:42.333 --> 02:45.250
You're on Good Morning Denver ?

02:45.333 --> 02:47.166
For real?

02:47.250 --> 02:50.208
Because I know you sometimes tend
to exaggerate things

02:50.291 --> 02:51.959
just a skosh.

02:52.667 --> 02:55.000
No, I'm on it.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.709
Come on, you've seen it.
I do the "Mama Bird" segment.

02:57.792 --> 03:00.250
Well, I only watch the important stuff,

03:00.375 --> 03:02.500
so I guess we'll never know for sure.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.583
- Hey, uh, Rhonda.
- Yeah?

03:05.667 --> 03:08.208
What has two thumbs
and likes to hit the putting green?

03:08.291 --> 03:10.083
Oh. Well, I don't know, Phil. What?

03:10.166 --> 03:11.208
This guy!

03:13.083 --> 03:14.291
Phil!

03:14.375 --> 03:16.083
Oh, I'm gonna miss this.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.000
Oh, that's right. You know what?

03:18.083 --> 03:19.542
Rhonda has a little announcement to make.

03:19.625 --> 03:20.583
Mm-hmm.

03:21.583 --> 03:25.792
I am leaving the show
to pursue a very exciting new opportunity.

03:25.875 --> 03:30.375
You are looking at the new host
of Wake Up Waco!

03:31.709 --> 03:33.250
Oh, we're gonna miss you
around here, Rhonda.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.125
Aww.

03:34.208 --> 03:35.625
I don't know how we'll ever replace you.

03:35.709 --> 03:37.083
Well, I do.

03:38.875 --> 03:40.208
With me!

03:41.375 --> 03:44.083
Oh, you can't be serious.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.834
I can just see it now.

03:45.917 --> 03:49.250
Good Morning Denver with Amy and Phil.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.041
Isn't it "Phil and Amy"?

03:51.125 --> 03:52.500
For now.

04:00.417 --> 04:03.041
Well, if it isn't the free lunch bunch.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.166
You're funny, Dad.

04:05.250 --> 04:07.291
Yeah, not trying to be.

04:09.792 --> 04:11.291
Emmett, is that my bathrobe?

04:11.333 --> 04:12.792
Yeah. Mine's dirty,

04:12.875 --> 04:14.709
and Mrs. Duncan's a little behind
on the wash.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.166
Oh, well.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.166
I guess I'll have to speak
to her about that.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.458
Could you?

04:21.250 --> 04:23.750
Well, since subtlety
doesn't seem to be working,

04:23.834 --> 04:25.041
let me be direct.

04:25.125 --> 04:28.667
PJ, you promised to look for a job
after you graduated cooking school.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.000
I know. I'm off to kind of a slow start.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.291
Have you started?

04:32.375 --> 04:33.667
No.

04:36.417 --> 04:37.417
I promise.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.667
Right after lunch I'm gonna get out there
and find a job.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.083
- Great.
- Oh, actually,

04:41.166 --> 04:44.875
right after lunch Yacky the Duck is on,
so it'll be right after that.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.083
Okay.

04:47.166 --> 04:50.375
Well, Emmett,
all we need is a plan for you.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.875
Oh, I got a plan.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.583
Seven more years of community college,

04:53.667 --> 04:55.291
then it's hello, job market.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.208
So, I guess there's no rush
to get you out of that bathrobe.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.250
Not unless you wanna see
some of your underwear.

05:09.917 --> 05:12.417
So, do you think I'm a good girlfriend?

05:12.500 --> 05:15.000
Well, I don't have much
to judge it on, but yeah.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.125
I'm glad.

05:18.208 --> 05:19.792
And as a good girlfriend,

05:19.875 --> 05:21.417
I want you to know
if you ever need anything,

05:21.500 --> 05:22.417
I'll be there for you.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.500
Okay.

05:23.583 --> 05:25.125
Would you be there for me?

05:25.834 --> 05:26.959
Sure.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.417
Great.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.500
Grandma! He said yes!

05:31.792 --> 05:33.709
Hey... Oh! Wha-- what's going on here?

05:34.917 --> 05:36.333
Nice job, Lauren.

05:37.542 --> 05:39.625
I'm so sorry. She forced me.

05:41.083 --> 05:42.500
Okay, what do you want?

05:42.583 --> 05:44.250
I've got a situation.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.375
The house next door to me is for sale.

05:46.458 --> 05:47.834
Well, that's understandable.

05:48.709 --> 05:49.959
Anyway...

05:50.041 --> 05:52.959
The family that's gonna buy it
has a ten-year-old boy.

05:53.041 --> 05:55.166
- So?
- A ten-year-old boy

05:55.250 --> 05:57.083
who reminds me of you!

05:57.166 --> 05:58.959
Same evil twinkle in his eye!

05:59.041 --> 06:02.083
I can't go through another Gabe Duncan,
I can't! I tell you!

06:03.291 --> 06:05.166
Okay, calm down.

06:05.250 --> 06:06.583
What do you want me to do?

06:06.667 --> 06:09.208
I want you to talk to him,
one devil child to another.

06:09.291 --> 06:10.834
Tell him I'm off-limits.

06:12.041 --> 06:13.041
Fine, I'll do it.

06:13.125 --> 06:14.417
Good.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.750
Again, I am so sorry.

06:17.834 --> 06:20.083
Yeah, well, the next time
we talk about our relationship,

06:20.166 --> 06:21.375
I'm paying attention.

06:26.709 --> 06:28.542
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, Amy.

06:28.959 --> 06:31.000
Um, do you mind if I, uh...

06:31.083 --> 06:33.000
if I sit in Rhonda's chair?

06:33.083 --> 06:34.709
Sure, knock yourself out.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.000
Okay.

06:36.083 --> 06:38.709
I'm just gonna... Ohh... Wow.

06:38.792 --> 06:41.000
That is really comfy.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.667
Almost like it was made for me.

06:45.959 --> 06:48.709
Actually, they were made
for me and Rhonda.

06:48.792 --> 06:50.834
They measured our butts and everything.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.500
Oh. Cute story.

06:53.583 --> 06:55.583
Say, I wonder whose butt

06:55.667 --> 06:57.750
they're gonna be measuring
for this chair now.

06:58.208 --> 06:59.792
Well, I don't know.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.542
- Oh.
- We're gonna miss that Rhonda.

07:01.959 --> 07:03.208
Are we?

07:05.250 --> 07:06.667
I mean, let's face it, Phil.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.333
You've been carrying Rhonda for years.

07:08.834 --> 07:12.333
Well, I don't wanna get into it, but yeah.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.375
Knowing you,

07:14.458 --> 07:17.166
I'm sure you'll make the wise decision
to promote from within.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.458
Hmm. Well, I hadn't thought about that.

07:19.542 --> 07:21.041
Yeah, the question is, who?

07:21.125 --> 07:23.041
I mean, Pilar's okay on traffic,

07:23.125 --> 07:25.125
but how is she with small talk?

07:25.208 --> 07:26.333
Yeah.

07:26.792 --> 07:28.500
And Misty Mountains is great with weather,

07:28.583 --> 07:32.083
but, um, is her brain
a low-pressure system?

07:35.125 --> 07:37.750
My goodness, Phil. I said something catty,

07:37.834 --> 07:39.500
- and you made a cat noise.
- I did.

07:39.583 --> 07:41.500
I love it. I love it!

07:41.583 --> 07:42.500
We are clicking.

07:42.583 --> 07:43.500
We are. Are we?

07:43.583 --> 07:44.875
We are!

07:45.208 --> 07:47.166
If only the viewers could see us.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.208
I j-- I just had an idea.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.083
Why don't you audition?

07:55.166 --> 07:57.208
- Me?
- Yeah.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.792
Well, I would say that that sounds crazy,

07:59.875 --> 08:02.166
but I know what good judgment you have.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.875
Tell you what,
I'm gonna give you an on-air tryout.

08:05.959 --> 08:07.375
If all goes well, who knows?

08:07.709 --> 08:11.291
Good Morning Denver with Phil and Amy.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.583
It's all happening so fast.

08:21.625 --> 08:23.375
- Packing for college, huh?
- Teddy: Mm-hmm.

08:23.458 --> 08:24.542
Need some help?

08:25.166 --> 08:26.625
What do you want?

08:26.917 --> 08:30.250
What makes you think I want something?

08:30.333 --> 08:32.583
You said, "Need some help?"

08:33.000 --> 08:36.333
Yeah, right. You got me.
Of course, I want something.

08:36.417 --> 08:38.250
- What?
- Your room.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.792
Gabe, no one's getting my room.

08:40.875 --> 08:43.125
I'm sure Mom and Dad
are gonna leave it as is.

08:43.208 --> 08:44.917
That's right.
It's gonna be a shrine to you,

08:45.000 --> 08:46.917
because we're all gonna miss you so much.

08:50.583 --> 08:53.333
Look, I know you're trying to hide it,
but you're gonna miss me.

08:53.417 --> 08:54.709
No, I won't.

08:55.834 --> 08:56.834
Aww.

08:56.917 --> 08:59.000
Well, I'm gonna miss you!

08:59.083 --> 09:01.709
You know,
I'll never forget that time when we...

09:03.875 --> 09:05.667
Or when we, um...

09:07.500 --> 09:10.250
You know what?
Before I go, let's do something together.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.375
Does this count?

09:12.458 --> 09:13.542
- Get out.
- Okay.

09:21.166 --> 09:22.583
Oh, hey, Charlie.

09:22.667 --> 09:23.792
Whatcha doin'?

09:23.875 --> 09:25.166
I'm packing for Yale.

09:25.250 --> 09:26.667
Need some help?

09:28.625 --> 09:30.959
You're gonna leave that TV, right?

09:36.750 --> 09:38.250
"Good night, moon..."

09:40.083 --> 09:41.250
And...

09:41.333 --> 09:43.750
Good night to a whole bunch
of other stuff.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.375
Hey, there he is!

09:49.000 --> 09:50.375
How was job hunting today?

09:50.458 --> 09:51.709
Terrible.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.917
Every restaurant I walked into
was the same thing.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.125
As soon as the hostess finds out
you're not a customer,

09:56.208 --> 09:57.709
they're not very nice to you.

09:57.792 --> 09:59.041
"Hello, sir, can I help you?"

09:59.125 --> 10:00.375
Yeah, they don't mean it.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.750
Well, tomorrow's another day.

10:03.834 --> 10:04.709
I don't know, Dad.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.375
The food biz is pretty tough to crack.

10:06.458 --> 10:08.625
Maybe I should just go back
to my original dream

10:08.709 --> 10:11.583
of being a baseball player
or a police guy.

10:13.834 --> 10:15.542
Your dream from when you were four?

10:15.667 --> 10:17.250
Yes, I said my original dream.

10:18.458 --> 10:21.750
Look, it's not supposed to be easy.

10:21.834 --> 10:24.000
Hey, it's not like someone's
just gonna knock on the door

10:24.083 --> 10:25.542
and offer you a job.

10:31.125 --> 10:32.375
Hey, hey, Gravy!

10:32.458 --> 10:34.750
Hey, buddy! Hey, you need a job?

10:36.166 --> 10:38.125
- Hey, Mr. D!
- Bob: Hey.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.458
Dude, how'd you know I needed a job?

10:40.542 --> 10:42.041
Oh, I read in the Kwikki Chikki University

10:42.125 --> 10:44.667
alumni association newsletter
that you graduated from cooking school.

10:45.542 --> 10:48.542
Kwikki Chikki University
has an alumni association?

10:48.625 --> 10:50.458
You were only there for two days.

10:50.542 --> 10:52.333
So we can't have a newsletter?

10:55.333 --> 10:57.542
I believe there was something about a job.

10:57.625 --> 11:00.166
Yeah, my dad bought me my own food truck,
and I need a little help.

11:00.250 --> 11:01.250
Interested?

11:01.333 --> 11:03.458
- Mmm--
- Hey, he'll take it!

11:03.542 --> 11:05.125
- When does he start?
- Tomorrow.

11:05.208 --> 11:06.333
Perfect!

11:06.417 --> 11:08.625
Gravy, you have made us very happy.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.709
It's what I do!

11:21.875 --> 11:23.083
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.208
I'm Gabe Duncan.
I live a couple houses over.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.041
I just wanted to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

11:27.125 --> 11:28.500
Oh. Well, thank you.

11:28.583 --> 11:31.458
But we're not officially neighbors
until after the inspection.

11:31.542 --> 11:33.750
But if everything goes well,
we'll be moving in right away.

11:33.834 --> 11:36.458
Oh, great story. So do you have any kids?

11:37.291 --> 11:38.792
Um, sure.

11:38.875 --> 11:40.083
Matt, come here.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.291
Matt, there's somebody here
who wants to meet you.

11:43.375 --> 11:45.000
- Gabe, this is my son Matt.
- Hey.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.500
Hey.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.709
Oh. Excuse me. I have to take this.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.000
Sarah: Hello?

11:50.542 --> 11:52.458
So, how you doin', Matt?

11:52.542 --> 11:53.542
Okay.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.250
Good. Now tell me, Matt.

11:55.333 --> 11:58.542
Do you like trouble? You know, mischief?

11:58.625 --> 11:59.959
Shenanigans?

12:00.041 --> 12:01.250
Pranks?

12:01.333 --> 12:03.333
- No.
- Don't lie to me.

12:03.417 --> 12:05.458
- Maybe a little.
- Yeah, all right.

12:05.542 --> 12:09.208
So, have you noticed the lady
who lives next door, Mrs. Dabney?

12:09.709 --> 12:11.041
I guess so.

12:11.125 --> 12:12.959
You guess not. Hands off.

12:13.041 --> 12:15.625
That poor beaten-down old lady is mine.

12:16.625 --> 12:18.125
What are you talking about?

12:18.208 --> 12:20.125
Nobody pranks her but me.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.333
I was pranking her
when you were in diapers.

12:22.417 --> 12:25.000
I was pranking her when I was in diapers.

12:25.709 --> 12:27.208
I was kind of a prodigy.

12:29.125 --> 12:31.792
What I'm trying to say is leave her alone.

12:31.875 --> 12:33.291
Okay.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.208
Is there anybody I can prank?

12:35.291 --> 12:36.959
Yeah. Sure, man.
I don't wanna tie your hands.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.375
Okay, Mr. Duggan across the street,

12:39.458 --> 12:41.625
he does not have caller ID.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.166
Use that as you will.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.583
You're not gonna have any?

12:51.667 --> 12:53.083
No, ma'am.

12:54.417 --> 12:56.375
Maybe I'll have a bite of yours.

12:56.458 --> 12:57.750
So...

12:58.583 --> 13:00.291
What flavor you gonna get?

13:00.375 --> 13:01.458
Vanilla.

13:01.542 --> 13:03.458
Or...

13:03.542 --> 13:05.125
Strawberry?

13:05.208 --> 13:07.041
Or...

13:07.125 --> 13:08.417
Chocolate?

13:08.500 --> 13:11.125
Chocolate! If you insist.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.583
Uh, excuse me?

13:14.834 --> 13:16.125
Spencer?

13:17.250 --> 13:20.000
Why is everyone
always so surprised to see me?

13:27.417 --> 13:28.625
What are you doing here?

13:28.709 --> 13:31.667
Yeah, I'm gonna give you a minute
to take in the uniform.

13:32.709 --> 13:35.542
I mean, I thought you were in Boston.

13:35.625 --> 13:37.125
Actually, I've been in Denver all summer.

13:37.208 --> 13:38.625
I'm going back to school next week.

13:38.709 --> 13:40.208
Why haven't you come by the house?

13:40.792 --> 13:42.917
Well, you know, Teddy and I--

13:43.000 --> 13:45.208
Oh, right. You two aren't...

13:45.291 --> 13:46.709
Talking very much anymore.

13:46.875 --> 13:47.875
Yeah.

13:48.709 --> 13:49.917
So how's she doing?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.709
I'm getting her room!

13:53.542 --> 13:55.375
- She's going to Yale.
- Really?

13:55.458 --> 13:56.709
Good for her.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.083
I knew she'd get in.

13:58.166 --> 14:01.959
And, uh, the room thing
has not been decided, little lady.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.542
It's a girl's room. Just saying.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.750
So, is Teddy still dating that guy?

14:09.834 --> 14:12.959
You know, the one with the, uh,
hair and the fake smile?

14:13.959 --> 14:15.583
- Beau?
- Yeah.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.041
Yeah, that was his weird name.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.542
No. No. He went back to Tennessee.

14:20.834 --> 14:21.834
Oh.

14:22.417 --> 14:23.458
Too bad.

14:23.542 --> 14:25.291
Yeah, Teddy's doing okay with it.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.500
I'm still struggling.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.959
Well, here she is.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.750
- What do you think?
- "The Gravy Boat."

14:39.834 --> 14:41.333
You get it? 'Cause I'm Gravy.

14:41.417 --> 14:43.125
Why the "boat" part?

14:43.208 --> 14:44.792
- Oh, 'cause we serve fish...
- Ohh.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.875
- ...with gravy.
- Oh!

14:46.959 --> 14:50.917
Yeah, flounder with gravy,
halibut with gravy, cod with gravy.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.917
Our slogan is,
"If you like fish, we got it covered...

14:54.000 --> 14:55.250
in gravy!"

14:56.083 --> 14:59.166
Dude, I'm not sure about this concept.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.792
Oh, come on.
There's nothing else out there like this.

15:01.875 --> 15:03.709
There may be a reason for that.

15:03.792 --> 15:05.291
It sounds kinda gross.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.792
No, no, you're just not used to it yet.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.792
I mean, hey, the first time
someone put eggs and bacon

15:08.875 --> 15:10.500
on a plate together,
I'm sure people were like,

15:10.583 --> 15:13.000
"What? Eggs come from chicken,
bacon comes from pig.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.166
I mean, this is chaos on a plate!"

15:16.792 --> 15:18.792
I don't know, man. Fish and gravy?

15:19.083 --> 15:21.667
Okay, what if we call it "Fish 'n' Gravy"?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.041
Well, I do like things
with "'N'" in the middle.

15:24.542 --> 15:25.667
All right, I'm in.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.166
Yes! All right, let's get started.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.333
First, we gotta go to the store,
pick up a few key supplies.

15:29.417 --> 15:31.125
- Like what?
- Fish and gravy.

15:38.333 --> 15:39.667
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

15:39.750 --> 15:42.667
Oh! Guess who I ran into
at the yogurt store?

15:42.750 --> 15:44.041
- Hmm?
- Spencer!

15:44.750 --> 15:45.750
Really?

15:45.834 --> 15:46.875
He's back in Denver?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.417
Asked how you were doing.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.041
He did? Wha-- So, um...

15:51.375 --> 15:52.667
So how did he say it?

15:52.750 --> 15:55.375
Like he was just being polite
or like he really wanted to know?

15:55.458 --> 15:57.250
Uh, I'm, I'm not sure.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.542
Well, Dad, did he say it like...

15:58.625 --> 16:00.333
"How's Teddy doing?" Or...

16:00.375 --> 16:01.917
"How's Teddy doing?"

16:03.208 --> 16:04.709
I don't know.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.959
I'm barely paying attention
to this conversation.

16:08.583 --> 16:12.250
Look, sweetie, if you wanna know,
go talk to him.

16:12.375 --> 16:14.500
Dad, I can't do that.

16:14.583 --> 16:15.834
The last time he saw me,

16:15.917 --> 16:17.583
he said he didn't wanna be
friends anymore.

16:17.667 --> 16:20.208
Ahh, maybe he's changed his mind.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.500
That's what I want you to find out.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.583
- Me?
- Yes.

16:24.667 --> 16:27.083
Tomorrow, I want you to go back
to the yogurt store,

16:27.166 --> 16:29.583
and invite him to my going-away party.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.041
- Okay.
- Hold on.

16:32.583 --> 16:35.834
When you invite him,
you cannot say that it was my idea.

16:35.917 --> 16:38.166
Okay? That way, if he says no,

16:38.250 --> 16:39.959
you're the one who invited him,

16:40.041 --> 16:41.750
so it looks like you got rejected.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.750
But if he says yes,

16:43.834 --> 16:45.625
that means that he's open
to being friends again.

16:45.709 --> 16:48.709
And then, you can tell him
that I asked you to ask him, okay?

16:50.542 --> 16:52.208
I better write this down.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.417
Remember when you asked me
if I was a good boyfriend?

17:00.083 --> 17:01.625
I believe the answer has been confirmed.

17:02.709 --> 17:03.834
You talk to that kid?

17:03.917 --> 17:06.917
Oh, yes,
the situation has been dealt with,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.917
and I think I deserve a little reward.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.125
You want me to let you win this game?

17:12.208 --> 17:14.208
It's better when you don't say it.

17:15.291 --> 17:17.917
You know, I really do appreciate it.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.375
If my grandma's happy, I'm happy.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.625
Mrs. Dabney: Help! Help!

17:22.750 --> 17:24.583
Oh, my gosh! That's her, come on!

17:26.500 --> 17:29.667
Mrs. Dabney yelling for help
used to be such a happy sound.

17:37.208 --> 17:38.458
Finally!

17:38.542 --> 17:39.709
What happened?

17:39.792 --> 17:41.083
This happened!

17:41.875 --> 17:44.917
That kid from next door
put glue on my chair.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.291
You said you were gonna take care of this.

17:47.375 --> 17:50.583
I thought I did.
The little weasel lied right to my face.

17:51.041 --> 17:53.000
What's wrong with kids today?

17:53.750 --> 17:56.458
Stop talking and get me out of this thing.

17:56.542 --> 17:57.959
What do we do?

17:58.458 --> 18:00.875
Well, if I know my glue...

18:00.959 --> 18:02.625
...and I do,

18:04.125 --> 18:05.834
we're gonna need to go
to the hardware store

18:05.917 --> 18:07.041
and get some solvent.

18:07.125 --> 18:08.375
All right, sit tight.

18:11.417 --> 18:12.709
"Sit tight."

18:14.792 --> 18:16.709
Oh, that's pretty good. Come on.

18:16.792 --> 18:18.792
- Just go already.
- Gabe: Okay.

18:21.792 --> 18:25.000
How did that kid know
I was gonna sit in this chair?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.417
What if I sat in that one?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.458
Devil child!

18:32.875 --> 18:33.959
Help!

18:39.375 --> 18:40.583
I need your help.

18:40.667 --> 18:44.000
Well, I'm not a psychiatrist,
but I'll see what I can do.

18:44.417 --> 18:47.125
Look, I don't have time
to trade insults with you today.

18:47.208 --> 18:50.291
Okay? I have a very important audition
to be the co-host

18:50.375 --> 18:51.542
for Good Morning Denver.

18:52.959 --> 18:55.667
Why don't we start by talking
about your mom?

18:57.542 --> 18:59.250
I'm serious.

18:59.333 --> 19:03.250
Look, now the key to this job
is to look interested

19:03.333 --> 19:06.166
when Phil is telling one
of his boring stories.

19:06.250 --> 19:07.375
Now that's where you come in.

19:07.458 --> 19:08.458
- Excuse me?
- Yup.

19:08.542 --> 19:10.458
I want you to tell one
of your boring stories

19:10.542 --> 19:12.834
and I'll react as if it's interesting.

19:12.917 --> 19:15.834
I happen to think my stories
are interesting.

19:16.208 --> 19:18.458
And now, so will I.

19:18.917 --> 19:20.709
Okay, so go ahead.
Just talk about anything

19:20.792 --> 19:23.375
and I will throw in some co-host banter.

19:23.458 --> 19:26.041
Okay. Ho, ho. Well...

19:26.125 --> 19:29.917
I guess I could talk about tea.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.375
Tea!

19:31.500 --> 19:33.333
A favorite beverage

19:33.417 --> 19:36.000
of all friends across the pond it is.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.166
I wouldn't do the accent.

19:41.083 --> 19:43.208
Okay, okay, tell me more about tea.

19:43.250 --> 19:48.000
Well, I like to sip my tea,
but I don't like it to get cold.

19:48.083 --> 19:51.500
So what I do is I preheat the cup.

19:51.583 --> 19:53.583
Preheat the cup?

19:53.667 --> 19:55.667
I'm on the edge of my seat.

19:57.458 --> 19:58.875
That's all I got.

20:00.458 --> 20:03.583
That's all you got?
You say that as if it weren't enough.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.208
Oh!

20:05.291 --> 20:06.500
- Debbie!
- Oh!

20:06.583 --> 20:08.166
You are priceless.

20:09.792 --> 20:13.667
Okay, I need you to tell me a sad story,
so I can work on my sad face.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.542
Something sad.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.792
Okay, well...

20:17.875 --> 20:20.250
Deedee won a goldfish
at the county fair...

20:20.834 --> 20:22.542
But it didn't last too long.

20:23.375 --> 20:24.709
What happened to it?

20:25.208 --> 20:26.166
The cat ate it.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.333
Oh my--

20:33.709 --> 20:35.917
It's the circle of life.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.792
Sunrise, sunset.

20:40.917 --> 20:43.417
We'll be back right after
this short break.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.166
Oh, hey, Mr. Duncan.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.500
Hey, Spencer. Uh, listen.

20:53.583 --> 20:57.083
We're having a little going-away party
for, uh, Teddy tomorrow night,

20:57.166 --> 21:00.792
"And, uh, I was wondering
if you wanted to come by.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.583
That's my idea, not hers.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.542
She doesn't know I'm here.

21:05.625 --> 21:07.375
Has no idea I'm inviting you."

21:07.458 --> 21:09.959
And a large chocolate with sprinkles.

21:11.458 --> 21:12.709
I'm sorry, what was that?

21:14.667 --> 21:15.667
Okay, you know what?

21:15.750 --> 21:17.583
Let's just start
with the important stuff...

21:17.667 --> 21:19.750
Large chocolate with sprinkles, please.

21:22.291 --> 21:24.583
So you want me to come to Teddy's party?

21:24.667 --> 21:25.875
Yeah. Me.

21:25.959 --> 21:27.375
Not her.

21:27.458 --> 21:29.083
Unless, of course, you say yes.

21:29.166 --> 21:30.667
And then, I don't know--

21:30.750 --> 21:32.333
I guess the whole thing's different.

21:36.375 --> 21:37.500
I don't know.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.041
Let me think about it.

21:40.125 --> 21:42.041
All right. Well, I understand.

21:42.125 --> 21:44.041
You and Teddy have been through a lot.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.834
You know, you gotta look down
deep into your heart and fig--

21:46.917 --> 21:49.333
Seriously, dude, that's all the sprinkles
you're gonna give me?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.125
Oh, oh! Finally our first customer.

22:02.208 --> 22:04.125
Uh, actually, that's my girlfriend.

22:04.208 --> 22:05.625
And I had to beg her to come here.

22:05.709 --> 22:06.709
Thanks, Skyler.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.417
Ahoy, matey!

22:09.500 --> 22:11.417
Welcome to The Gravy Boat.

22:12.250 --> 22:14.000
Fish with gravy?

22:14.125 --> 22:15.500
You owe me.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.208
Would you like to try our special today?

22:19.291 --> 22:21.083
The mystery fish?

22:21.166 --> 22:23.083
Ooh! What's the mystery fish?

22:23.166 --> 22:24.834
We forgot when we put the gravy on.

22:26.250 --> 22:27.875
I'll try the halibut with gravy.

22:28.542 --> 22:30.375
Here you go.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.583
Uh, what's wrong?

22:35.667 --> 22:39.375
Well, I like the fish...

22:39.917 --> 22:41.917
And I like the gravy.

22:43.208 --> 22:45.959
I'm just not sure I like the two together.

22:46.041 --> 22:47.625
Oh. Well.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.208
I like PJ...

22:49.583 --> 22:50.667
and I like you,

22:51.125 --> 22:53.709
I'm just not sure
I like the two of you together.

22:54.291 --> 22:56.041
Oh, Gravy, come on.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.625
Admit it. It's a terrible idea.

22:58.709 --> 23:00.542
What? We don't belong together?

23:00.625 --> 23:01.750
No. No, no, no.

23:02.208 --> 23:03.417
Fish and gravy.

23:04.041 --> 23:05.709
Guys, come on!

23:05.792 --> 23:07.792
How bad could it possibly be?

23:08.959 --> 23:10.417
Okay, yeah. It's pretty bad.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.750
What are we gonna do now?

23:13.834 --> 23:15.792
Well, I don't know what you're gonna do,

23:16.000 --> 23:17.250
but I'm outta here!

23:17.333 --> 23:18.208
Abandon ship!

23:18.291 --> 23:19.291
What?

23:21.875 --> 23:22.917
You're the captain now.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.166
You're giving me your truck?
What are you gonna tell your dad?

23:25.250 --> 23:26.792
Same thing I told him
when he got me a plane,

23:26.875 --> 23:28.041
"I lost it!"

23:29.542 --> 23:30.875
Gravy out!

23:41.333 --> 23:42.667
What do you want?

23:42.750 --> 23:45.834
I thought I told you,
hands off Mrs. Dabney.

23:45.917 --> 23:48.333
I don't have to listen to you, old man!

23:49.917 --> 23:52.750
You're past your prime. What are you, 13?

23:54.125 --> 23:55.250
Fourteen.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.625
Then go take a nap, Grandpa.

24:01.333 --> 24:02.959
Look, all I'm asking

24:03.041 --> 24:05.250
is that you leave Mrs. Dabney alone.

24:05.333 --> 24:07.542
Once I move in,
I'm gonna do whatever I want

24:07.625 --> 24:10.250
to whoever I want
and there's nothing you can do to stop me!

24:10.333 --> 24:13.333
Yeah, well, in this neighborhood
you're not welcome, Matt.

24:14.834 --> 24:16.000
Get it?

24:16.083 --> 24:17.375
Welcome mat.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.291
Lame!

24:26.166 --> 24:28.208
That was lame!

24:28.875 --> 24:30.333
Man, I've lost it.

24:31.083 --> 24:32.208
But I'm gonna get it back.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.959
Hear that? Getting it back!

24:35.083 --> 24:36.667
Now I'm talking to a door.

24:36.750 --> 24:38.083
What happened to me?

24:42.792 --> 24:44.542
Hey, Charlie.

24:44.792 --> 24:47.959
Last video diary. Here we go.

24:48.041 --> 24:50.083
Oh, um, actually,

24:50.166 --> 24:53.083
before I get to the big piece of wisdom

24:53.166 --> 24:55.583
that'll summarize the last four years,

24:55.667 --> 24:58.083
there's just one little thing
that I wanted to mention.

24:58.166 --> 25:02.834
So Dad ran into Spencer at a yogurt store

25:02.917 --> 25:06.917
and he may or may not be coming
to my farewell party.

25:07.208 --> 25:08.542
Interesting, right?

25:09.834 --> 25:12.834
Anyway, that said, the big wisdom is...

25:14.125 --> 25:16.417
Wait, why wouldn't he say yes or no?

25:17.709 --> 25:19.083
Why "maybe"?

25:20.625 --> 25:22.333
Okay, I'm sorry. I got distracted,

25:22.417 --> 25:24.375
The big message is...

25:26.709 --> 25:28.417
I need to know
if he's coming to the party.

25:28.500 --> 25:29.542
Dad!

25:32.125 --> 25:33.709
Next time on Good Luck, Charlie.

25:33.792 --> 25:35.917
I can't believe it's the last time
I'm gonna see everybody

25:36.000 --> 25:37.417
before I go off to college.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.542
Hey.

25:38.917 --> 25:41.208
I'm so glad we're back
to being friends again.

25:41.291 --> 25:42.542
Good morning, Amy.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.250
Good morning, Phil.

25:45.583 --> 25:47.583
I usually plan this kind of stuff
behind your back.

25:47.667 --> 25:49.375
- You're making me nervous.
- I'll turn around.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.709
That certainly can't hurt.

25:50.792 --> 25:52.083
All right. I'll be your partner.

25:52.166 --> 25:53.583
Thanks, Dad. It's gonna be awesome.

25:53.667 --> 25:55.166
It's the best sandwich I've ever had.

25:55.250 --> 25:56.875
I'm gonna miss you, Teddy.

25:56.959 --> 25:59.000
I'm gonna miss you too, Charlie.

25:59.667 --> 26:01.417
I'm gonna miss all you guys.
