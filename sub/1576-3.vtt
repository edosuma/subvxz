00:00.767 --> 00:03.869
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>two and a half men...</i>
<i>I almost died, alan.</i>

00:03.871 --> 00:05.471
But the important thing is
you didn't.

00:05.473 --> 00:08.107
Other than you guys
and my mom, I got nobody.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.441
At least you got jake.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.443
I want to have a kid of my own.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.312
There's no way you're getting
a baby-- you're a single guy,

00:13.314 --> 00:15.781
And the system is really geared
towards married couples.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.983
Alan harper,
will you marry me?

00:17.985 --> 00:19.485
I now pronounce you married.

00:20.553 --> 00:23.422
You may kiss.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.193
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

00:28.195 --> 00:31.096
Um, yes, this is walden schmidt.

00:31.098 --> 00:33.298
I'd like to order
a credit card for my husband,

00:33.300 --> 00:35.601
Mr. Alan harper-schmidt.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.803
Uh, yeah, and, uh,
refresh my memory.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.873
What's the cash advance limit
on my black card?

00:44.144 --> 00:46.211
Holy new rolex.

00:48.481 --> 00:51.350
Oh, oh, m-my mother's
maiden name?

00:51.352 --> 00:54.820
Uh, I didn't really know her
before she was married, so...

00:54.822 --> 00:55.854
Morning.

00:55.856 --> 00:58.824
Um, uh, I'll call back later.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.259
Charities.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.728
It's not like the kids won't
still be starving in an hour.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.898
Um...

01:05.900 --> 01:07.900
Hey, I was meaning
to ask you something.

01:07.902 --> 01:10.402
Um, what's your
mother's maiden name?

01:10.404 --> 01:14.940
This might be easier if I just
give you my online password.
Oh.

01:14.942 --> 01:18.210
It's "don't order
credit cards in my name."

01:19.913 --> 01:22.581
Right, uh, all one word,
no spaces?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.650
Hey, there's
the newlyweds.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.418
I made you some
honeymoon pancakes.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.853
Aw...

01:27.855 --> 01:29.755
They're in the shapes
of hearts and arrows.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.291
Oh, actually,
they're asses and...

01:32.293 --> 01:34.259
Uh, sure--
hearts and arrows.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.694
(laughs)

01:35.696 --> 01:38.630
Alan, my arrow's twice
as big as yours.

01:38.632 --> 01:39.932
Mine's life-size.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.200
I'm still gonna be hungry.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.769
I just realized,
walden,

01:43.771 --> 01:45.838
That I worked for you
when you were single.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.373
And now you're married.

01:48.375 --> 01:51.944
Maybe someday I'll be working
for you when you're a widower.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.679
Bacon, zippy?

01:55.548 --> 01:57.850
So, how's the adoption
process going?

01:57.852 --> 02:00.085
Is somebody other than alan
calling you "daddy"?

02:04.357 --> 02:06.892
It's going great.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.894
We have a meeting with
the social services department

02:08.896 --> 02:09.895
This week.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.263
Nice.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.999
So, if you do get a kid,
which room is he gonna live in?

02:17.704 --> 02:19.738
Oh, guys, I'm kind of
a drunken slut,

02:19.740 --> 02:22.074
I don't think I should
share a room with a baby.

02:23.576 --> 02:26.545
â™ª men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men â™ª

02:26.547 --> 02:29.314
â™ª ah.
â™ª men.
â™ª men.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.354
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

02:35.356 --> 02:37.256
Hey, what ya doing?

02:37.258 --> 02:39.525
Oh, paperwork for our meeting
with the social worker.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.161
Um, household
net worth.

02:42.163 --> 02:45.330
Well, let's see, uh, you're
worth a billion dollars,

02:45.332 --> 02:47.032
So together we are worth...

02:47.034 --> 02:49.401
A little bit less than
a billion dollars.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.805
Hey, so evelyn said it's cool
if I crash at her place.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.240
What, wait--
it was that easy?

02:55.242 --> 02:56.675
My mom never
lets me stay there.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.410
Yeah, she's gonna let me live
in the guest house.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.412
There's a guest house?!

03:00.414 --> 03:02.447
If-if you need, uh, help
moving, let us know.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.483
Thanks, but evelyn said
I could borrow the range rover.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.085
There's a range rover?!

03:07.087 --> 03:08.887
Oh, hey, uh, what should
I put down for, uh...

03:08.889 --> 03:10.589
"why do you want
to adopt a child?"

03:10.591 --> 03:11.723
Hmm.

03:11.725 --> 03:12.724
'cause we're dudes,

03:12.726 --> 03:13.759
And we don't have
baby holes?

03:13.761 --> 03:15.827
(laughing)

03:18.631 --> 03:20.199
You know you have
to sell yourself

03:20.201 --> 03:21.333
As a real couple, right?

03:21.335 --> 03:22.868
We are a real couple.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.736
That's why we got married
in the first place.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.072
Yeah, it also gave us the chance
to register at crate & barrel

03:27.074 --> 03:28.473
For this fabulous stemware.

03:28.475 --> 03:29.841
(chimes)
ding.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.210
See, you're making jokes instead

03:31.212 --> 03:33.645
Of expressing real emotion.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.548
You're gonna have to prove that
you're a real couple, you know?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.817
That you're in love,
that you're soul mates,

03:38.819 --> 03:41.486
That you can't survive
without the other.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.755
I actually can't survive
without him.

03:43.757 --> 03:44.756
I am just saying,

03:44.758 --> 03:45.891
I don't want to see you

03:45.893 --> 03:46.992
Put all this work in and not get

03:46.994 --> 03:48.794
The payoff you deserve.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.495
It's like when you get
"the tap."

03:50.497 --> 03:52.331
Get the what?
The tap.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.466
You know, when you're
in bed with a girl,

03:54.468 --> 03:56.168
And you've been
down there for a while,

03:56.170 --> 03:58.870
And suddenly she gives you
the old "thanks for trying" tap

03:58.872 --> 04:00.439
On the top of the head.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.108
Ah...

04:03.110 --> 04:06.278
Oh, yeah, the tap, yeah.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.046
I hate the tap.
Mm.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.549
You know, I am sure
that we can be believable

04:10.551 --> 04:11.883
As a loving couple.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.419
You want to see believable?
This... (stammers)

04:14.421 --> 04:16.121
Watch.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.623
Alan,

04:17.625 --> 04:19.291
I love you.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.460
And I love you, walden.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.762
(laughing)

04:23.764 --> 04:25.364
I'm sorry.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.066
You have this one nose hair
that keeps going in and out.
Oh.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.969
And I laughed because
no one could possibly love me.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.842
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

04:37.810 --> 04:39.111
Guess what I just finished.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.445
Once again,

04:40.447 --> 04:43.282
You don't have to tell me
every time you masturbate.

04:43.284 --> 04:46.652
I will not apologize
for sharing my day with you.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.554
But that is not this.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.290
It is my essay describing

04:51.292 --> 04:52.791
What I love about my spouse

04:52.793 --> 04:54.393
For our meeting
with the social worker.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.528
Ah, good, I'm so nervous
about this meeting.

04:56.530 --> 05:00.098
I'm somehow constipated and
wracked with explosive diarrhea.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.036
You're not the only one
who can share his day.

05:04.038 --> 05:05.637
Well, after she reads this,

05:05.639 --> 05:08.373
There's no way she won't
believe we're a couple.

05:08.375 --> 05:13.211
Okay, uh, "walden is the most
caring person I know.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.380
He always puts my needs
before his own."

05:15.382 --> 05:16.782
Uh, "whether it's surprising me

05:16.784 --> 05:19.051
"with an espresso and a
chocolate croissant in bed,

05:19.053 --> 05:21.086
"glamping in a yurt
at big sur,

05:21.088 --> 05:23.555
"or sneaking up behind me
in the shower with a loofah

05:23.557 --> 05:25.590
To exfoliate those hard-to-reach
places..."

05:27.393 --> 05:28.960
"...He's my everything--

05:28.962 --> 05:32.230
My husband, my lover,
my friend."

05:33.866 --> 05:35.567
"my wally bear."

05:38.438 --> 05:39.571
My god.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.872
I know.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.207
Now read me yours.

05:44.577 --> 05:47.346
Okay, um...

05:47.348 --> 05:49.881
"alan is my best friend."

05:49.883 --> 05:51.616
Loving it!

05:53.886 --> 05:55.987
"he's 47 years old.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.425
"he used to be a chiropractor.

06:00.427 --> 06:03.195
"he has never been
convicted of a felony.

06:04.630 --> 06:07.699
And his favorite meal
is swordfish."

06:09.969 --> 06:12.504
Are you kidding me?

06:12.506 --> 06:13.972
<i>That's</i> what you love about me?

06:13.974 --> 06:15.607
That I've never
been <i>convicted</i> of a felony?

06:15.609 --> 06:17.476
I told you it's
a work in progress.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.910
What do you want me to say?

06:18.912 --> 06:21.646
He masturbates
with impressive frequency?

06:21.648 --> 06:24.216
At least that would show
you're paying attention.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.951
(doorbell rings)
and, by the way--

06:25.953 --> 06:29.154
My favorite meal
is red snapper.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.960
Hi, alan.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.161
Walden.

06:36.163 --> 06:39.030
Lyndsey, what's, uh,
what's going on?

06:39.032 --> 06:40.298
I-I thought you were
in rehab.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.567
I was, I-I got out
a couple days ago.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.236
Oh, well, that's great.
C-come on it.

06:46.072 --> 06:50.208
How'd it go?
It was the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.543
But-but on the plus side,

06:51.545 --> 06:53.478
It was right up the
street here in malibu,

06:53.480 --> 06:55.881
So ocean views,
spa, chef,

06:55.883 --> 06:57.349
It was like
a five-star hotel.

06:57.351 --> 07:01.052
Except they take
your shoelaces.

07:01.054 --> 07:04.222
Well, I'm sure you two have
a lot to talk about.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.224
So, I'm just gonna go
in the kitchen

07:06.226 --> 07:07.626
And pretend I'm not listening.

07:09.762 --> 07:13.698
Um, so, lyndsey,
I-I'm so proud of you.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.267
Uh, how are you doing?

07:15.269 --> 07:16.601
I'm good.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.570
Um, I-I just got
my 60-day chip.
Oh.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.840
And part of my recovery
is to make amends

07:21.842 --> 07:23.074
To the people I've hurt.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.543
So,

07:24.545 --> 07:27.579
I apologize for everything I did
to you while I was drinking.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.915
Oh, well, I appreciate that, um,

07:29.917 --> 07:31.817
But some of the things
you did to me,

07:31.819 --> 07:33.118
You don't have to apologize for.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.521
I mean, we had sex
in a chipotle.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.194
I ate my burrito,
you ate my burrito.

07:44.030 --> 07:46.164
I ate your taco.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.934
And I later threw up
in your car.

07:48.936 --> 07:52.637
Yes, uh, but chunks weren't the
only thing you blew that day.

07:56.108 --> 08:00.011
Um, there is one other thing.

08:00.013 --> 08:03.448
If-if I haven't burned
too many bridges,

08:03.450 --> 08:07.018
I was wondering if maybe you
and I could give it another try.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.186
Oh, wow.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.187
Wow, that-that
is flattering.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.188
Um, it's just...

08:10.190 --> 08:11.857
(sighs)
you're seeing somebody else.

08:11.859 --> 08:15.861
Uh, kind of, um...

08:15.863 --> 08:17.362
Uh, uh, I'm...

08:17.364 --> 08:19.231
You're married?!

08:20.266 --> 08:21.500
That doesn't make any sense.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.567
Who is she?

08:22.569 --> 08:25.637
Uh...

08:25.639 --> 08:28.707
Uh, she is-is
actually, uh, a "he."

08:28.709 --> 08:30.108
Um...

08:30.110 --> 08:31.810
It's... It's walden.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.312
Oh, my god.

08:35.314 --> 08:37.616
Walden's gay?!

08:40.152 --> 08:42.187
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

08:42.189 --> 08:44.322
So, I guess what
I'm interested in is

08:44.324 --> 08:45.824
How you two got together.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.126
Uh, well, w-we met
at the dog park.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.929
His labradoodle
sniffed my shih tzu.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.399
I remember when I proposed.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.334
I-I got down on one knee,

08:56.336 --> 08:58.303
And I looked up
into his beautiful...

08:59.505 --> 09:02.007
...Blue eyes,

09:02.009 --> 09:04.209
And I asked him to share
his life with me.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.444
I guess what
I'm getting at is the fact

09:06.446 --> 09:08.713
That you've both been
married to women before.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.515
So, when did you realize
you were gay?

09:10.517 --> 09:15.120
Oh, well, on some level,
I've always known. Um...

09:16.222 --> 09:18.790
I mean, throughout, uh,
both of my marriages,

09:18.792 --> 09:20.625
I was in complete denial.

09:20.627 --> 09:21.893
Um, but after I met walden,

09:21.895 --> 09:24.596
I finally felt safe
to-to be myself.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.298
Uh, I remember
our first date.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.266
Uh, we went to the bowl to
see the <i>grease</i> sing-along.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.001
Ah, "tell me more,
tell me more."

09:30.003 --> 09:32.404
Well, uh, walden was
dressed as danny zuko,

09:32.406 --> 09:33.538
Uh, and I was sandy--

09:33.540 --> 09:35.173
Uh, hot sandy, you
know, in the leather.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.841
No, no, no, I was doing
the song, you know--

09:36.843 --> 09:38.176
â™ª tell me more,
tell me more... â™ª

09:38.178 --> 09:40.612
Oh, my god!

09:40.614 --> 09:42.080
Did I miss a show tune cue?!

09:42.082 --> 09:43.148
(laughs)

09:43.150 --> 09:45.550
Somebody take away my gay card.

09:47.386 --> 09:49.321
And how about you, walden?

09:49.323 --> 09:50.755
When did you know you were gay?

09:50.757 --> 09:54.225
I guess my first clue was
when I saw <i>basic instinct.</i>

09:55.294 --> 09:57.629
All my friends were looking up
sharon stone's skirt,

09:57.631 --> 09:59.664
And I was just looking
at her shoes.

10:01.133 --> 10:04.336
And I guess I got married
because of social pressures,

10:04.338 --> 10:07.606
But, eventually,
I had to be true to who I am.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.040
And I've never
looked back since.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.076
Unless I'm behind him.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.912
(both laughing nervously)

10:15.781 --> 10:17.949
(laughing nervously):
That's a good one.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.250
Ah...

10:19.252 --> 10:22.587
You two are
an interesting couple.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.422
Yeah, I see hundreds
of potential parents,

10:24.424 --> 10:25.690
But you two are
different somehow.

10:25.692 --> 10:26.958
I'm not sure what it is.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.526
Well, uh, maybe it's the fact

10:28.528 --> 10:31.529
That I-I look like I'm wearing
makeup, but I'm not.

10:33.065 --> 10:36.468
Y-you know, we may not be
like other couples, but...

10:36.470 --> 10:38.269
I know we can be
good parents.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.038
I get that, but it is my job

10:40.040 --> 10:42.340
To be a hundred percent sure
before I place a child.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.808
No, n-no,
look, look...

10:43.810 --> 10:47.278
I-I know we can provide
unconditional love to a child,

10:47.280 --> 10:51.783
A-and w-we can create a safe,
secure environment, and...

10:52.918 --> 10:55.020
What do people
that get kids say?

10:55.988 --> 10:57.022
How about this--

10:57.024 --> 10:58.523
How about I come out
to your house?

10:58.525 --> 10:59.958
We normally do
a site visit anyway.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.926
This way I could get to know
you guys a little better.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.795
Yeah, great, yeah,
why don't you come on over,

11:03.797 --> 11:07.132
And you'll see that we're
j-just a normal loving couple.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.133
Right, sweetie?

11:08.135 --> 11:10.268
That-that's right,
wally bear.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.703
I love this guy.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.776
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

11:21.113 --> 11:23.114
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

11:23.116 --> 11:24.115
Hey.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.450
Oh, flowers.
Nice touch.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.052
Gives the house a homey feel.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.720
They're for you.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.422
Really?

11:30.424 --> 11:32.791
I'm, uh, actually a lily man.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.559
Uh, but they're very nice.

11:34.561 --> 11:35.760
Alan, listen.

11:35.762 --> 11:36.961
Jenny was right.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.197
We are not believable
as a loving couple,

11:39.199 --> 11:41.733
And I think that's why miss
mcmartin wasn't sure about us.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.468
Now, this has
to be real.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.803
And that includes--

11:44.805 --> 11:47.238
Being comfortable with
physical affection.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.307
Like this.

11:52.078 --> 11:53.311
Come on.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.546
Loosen up.

11:54.548 --> 11:58.049
I-I'm loose, it just feels
a little forced, that's all.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.385
Okay, well, let
it be natural.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.420
Just snuggle into
these broad shoulders.

12:08.527 --> 12:10.528
I do feel safe.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.797
Damn right, you do.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.866
You're with
your wally bear.

12:16.802 --> 12:19.370
Now, look
into my eyes.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.672
Like this?

12:20.674 --> 12:21.673
Yeah, exactly.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.441
And don't look away.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.646
We love each other.

12:28.648 --> 12:29.881
You're at home.

12:31.183 --> 12:34.819
Oh, I just noticed a little
green fleck in your right eye.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.654
It's like a-a downy
patch of moss

12:36.656 --> 12:39.057
On the trunk
of a majestic oak.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.526
(whispering):
Thank you.

12:43.462 --> 12:46.264
Sometimes I worry that I'm not
good-looking enough for you.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.500
Come on.

12:48.502 --> 12:49.968
You're perfect just
the way you are.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.637
My alley cat.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.640
A nickname.

12:57.009 --> 12:59.377
Sometimes...

12:59.379 --> 13:02.747
I worry that you don't know
how much you mean to me.

13:02.749 --> 13:05.850
I want to be
your everything.

13:19.832 --> 13:22.834
All right, yeah!

13:22.836 --> 13:24.969
That was convincing.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.604
We do that in front
of miss mcmartin,

13:26.606 --> 13:28.606
We'll get ten babies.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.841
Yeah, yeah.

13:29.843 --> 13:33.211
That was good enough
to fool just about anyone.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.846
(chuckles nervously)

13:34.848 --> 13:36.848
(sighs)

13:36.850 --> 13:39.217
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

13:39.219 --> 13:41.519
So, this is
our kitchen.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.854
We love to
cook together.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.322
Uh, correction,
I love to cook,

13:44.324 --> 13:45.990
He loves to eat.

13:45.992 --> 13:49.127
See? This is what
I wanted to see.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.795
The two of you just
being yourselves.

13:50.797 --> 13:51.830
Happy, relaxed.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.798
(doorbell rings)
oh, I'll get that.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.733
If you really want
to see us relaxed

13:55.735 --> 13:57.602
You should come by
for brunch someday.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.271
The mary's are bloody
and the lorraine's are quiche.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.941
Oh, I can see why
you fell in love with him.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.310
Really?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.946
What did you see exactly?

14:09.381 --> 14:11.516
Alan!

14:11.518 --> 14:13.518
Lyndsey?

14:13.520 --> 14:14.819
Um, have you
been drinking?

14:14.821 --> 14:18.389
Uh, ding-ding-ding,
we have a wiener...

14:18.391 --> 14:19.824
Whoa, whoa,
okay, okay, shh!

14:19.826 --> 14:20.992
W-what are you
doing here?

14:20.994 --> 14:23.528
Well, you said
you and walden

14:23.530 --> 14:25.396
Are just getting married
to get a kid.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.800
So, there's no reason you can't
have sex with me on the side.

14:28.802 --> 14:30.568
You know, the "dl."

14:30.570 --> 14:33.471
That means "do lyndsey."

14:33.473 --> 14:36.374
Okay, okay, okay, this
is not a good time.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.775
Uh, the-the social
worker's here.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.010
Oh, that's great!

14:39.012 --> 14:40.712
I can help you guys.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.014
I can tell her that
you'll be good parents.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.983
And I know because
I'm a g... Oh.

14:46.585 --> 14:48.686
...Mother.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.822
Okay, um...

14:50.824 --> 14:53.424
Maybe-maybe we should go
to my room a-and talk.

14:53.426 --> 14:57.395
I won't be able to talk much,
'cause my mouth will be full.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.496
Wink, wink.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.165
(giggles)
hopefully with breath mints.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.536
You wait in here and I will
call a cab to take you home.

15:05.538 --> 15:09.440
My home is in your pants.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.876
What happened? Why did
you start drinking again?

15:11.878 --> 15:13.778
Well, 'cause you married walden.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.414
The only person in your life
who's prettier than me.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.616
But you know we're just
doing that to get a kid.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.252
Yeah, but if I wasn't
so screwed up last year,

15:21.254 --> 15:22.854
Then we would still be together.

15:22.856 --> 15:25.123
Then we could get married
and have a baby. (gasps)

15:25.125 --> 15:26.991
We could sell that baby
to walden.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.927
'cause let's face it,

15:28.929 --> 15:30.862
We don't want to raise
another kid,

15:30.864 --> 15:32.730
'cause both our kids suck.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.333
Okay, uh, refreshing,
drunk honesty aside,

15:35.335 --> 15:36.601
Um, d-don't blame yourself.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.069
We all made mistakes.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.505
But we shouldn't let those
mistakes ruin things for walden.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.407
Shh. You talk too much.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.108
Let's party.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.514
Lyndsey? Lyndsey?

15:49.516 --> 15:51.749
(groans)

15:51.751 --> 15:54.752
Wow, a half-naked drunk girl
is in my bed and I'm leaving.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.321
Maybe I am gay.

15:57.723 --> 16:00.258
I like to imagine the
family gathered here,

16:00.260 --> 16:02.760
Eating an all-organic,
gluten-free meal

16:02.762 --> 16:05.330
Of quinoa salad
and kale chips

16:05.332 --> 16:07.765
While watching the
original reality tv:

16:07.767 --> 16:10.168
A beautiful
ocean sunset.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.837
As long as this is a stable
environment for a child,

16:12.839 --> 16:14.672
I don't care
if you're eating hot pockets

16:14.674 --> 16:16.708
And watching <i>honey boo boo.</i>

16:16.710 --> 16:19.844
Uh, uh, wally bear, uh, can
I borrow you for a minute?

16:19.846 --> 16:22.380
Is it an emergency,
alley cat?

16:22.382 --> 16:26.284
Uh, it's more of a-a pickle, uh,
that needs immediate attention.

16:28.253 --> 16:29.787
Oh, it's okay. Go.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.323
Yeah, I would never come between
a man and his husband's pickle.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.228
Lyndsey's here.
She's drunk.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.363
Why?

16:38.365 --> 16:39.697
She wants to have sex with me.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.632
Why?

16:41.634 --> 16:42.800
Wait... Where is she?

16:42.802 --> 16:44.369
She's passed out in my room.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.237
Okay, okay, we-we need
to get ms. Mcmartin

16:46.239 --> 16:47.872
Out of here as fast as we can.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.741
Right, right. Oh, um,
by the way, when lyndsey

16:49.743 --> 16:51.275
Tried to kiss me,
I was totally into it.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.443
I don't know why I was worried.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.212
Worried about what?

16:54.214 --> 16:55.913
Nothing. Let's get her
out of here.

16:57.383 --> 16:58.816
Mm. Everything okay?

16:58.818 --> 17:01.619
Yes, we just had
to reset the...
The, um...

17:01.621 --> 17:02.887
(mumbles): ...Flaven
on the stave.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.722
But, uh, everything's

17:04.724 --> 17:07.158
Okay now. Uh, c-can
I get you anything?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.826
Like directions for
your drive home, or...

17:08.828 --> 17:10.695
You know, I actually
do have to get going.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.363
I did not realize
it was this late.
What?

17:12.365 --> 17:14.165
No.
Oh.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.501
I'm so
disappointed.
Oh.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.536
I'll just get your things
and walk you out.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.805
Oh. There we go.
(chuckles)

17:20.807 --> 17:22.707
I got to say,
you look at that view

17:22.709 --> 17:23.975
And you never want to leave.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.843
And yet you must.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.578
Unless you want to adopt me.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.148
(chuckles) you're so funny.
Here's your jacket.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.818
Walden:
Oh, my god.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.753
What?
Uh...

17:35.755 --> 17:37.555
This jacket,
it's-it's fantastic.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.124
What is this, wool?
I think so, yeah.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.260
Really? Because I... I would've
thought it was linen.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.928
Doesn't it feel
"linen-sy", alan?

17:43.930 --> 17:45.229
No, it's
definitely wool.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.766
Holy crap.
What?

17:48.768 --> 17:50.935
Uh... I forgot to
flip the cushions

17:50.937 --> 17:52.136
On the deck
furniture.

17:52.138 --> 17:53.337
Imagine the
mildew.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.506
Alan.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.642
Milady.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.780
Here we go,
almost got it.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.282
If you could
just stay still...

18:04.284 --> 18:05.550
Yeah... Oh.

18:07.953 --> 18:10.621
Uh, all right, that's it.
That wasn't so hard, was it?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.657
Actually, it was a lot harder
than it needed to be, but...

18:12.659 --> 18:14.959
That's what he said.
(both chuckle)

18:14.961 --> 18:17.028
Uh, well...
Oh, your purse.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.729
Well, thank you, guys.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.198
Uh, you'll be hearing
from me soon.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.866
Got it. Bye.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.837
Oh, my god.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.271
Is lyndsey okay?

18:27.273 --> 18:29.040
Oh, sure. She's practically
indestructible when she's drunk.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.908
I've seen her fall down
a flight of stairs

18:30.910 --> 18:32.343
And not spill her mojito.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.578
(knocking)

18:34.680 --> 18:38.116
I'm so sorry,
I forgot my phone.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.651
Oh. Here it is, right
here on the table. Hey.
Oh, hey. Ho!

18:40.653 --> 18:42.220
(laughs) got it. And
get the hell out of here.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.556
Oh, one last thing. Um, I'm not
supposed to say anything,

18:45.558 --> 18:47.525
But unless something
crazy happens,

18:47.527 --> 18:48.926
You're gonna get approved.

18:49.728 --> 18:50.728
Seriously?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.029
Get out of here.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.231
Seriously.

18:53.233 --> 18:56.167
I'm here to help
with the baby.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.268
Seriously?

18:57.270 --> 18:58.469
Who is this?

18:58.471 --> 18:59.871
Uh, uh, she is...

18:59.873 --> 19:02.740
Oh, you know what,
this happens all the time.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.609
Tourists get an out-of-date
map to celebrity homes.

19:04.611 --> 19:08.980
Honey, charlie sheen
doesn't live here anymore.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.382
Jenny:
Lyndsey?

19:11.384 --> 19:12.850
Hi.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.051
And who is this?

19:14.053 --> 19:16.487
I fell down
in the sand.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.989
This is...

19:17.991 --> 19:20.291
I'm the next-door
neighbor. Hi.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.559
Uh, we were having
a get-together

19:21.561 --> 19:23.060
And this one got away.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.495
Our next-door
neighbor.
That... Oh, that's right,

19:24.497 --> 19:25.630
I remember you

19:25.632 --> 19:27.465
From the fourth of
July block party.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.001
Yeah... Oh, which, by the way,
is amazing for kids.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.469
A waterslide,
shaved ice.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.005
My waterslide's
shaved.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.507
Okay, time to go home.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.909
And, um, you know what?

19:37.911 --> 19:40.111
These guys are great.
Ask anyone on our block.

19:40.113 --> 19:41.979
We're all pulling for them
to get a kid.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.648
Thank you.
You're very
sweet.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.249
Okay, here we go.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.484
No, where are you
taking me?

19:46.486 --> 19:47.685
To get a drink.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.287
Aw, you're
my best friend.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.191
Boy. Glad I never
gave her a baby.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.493
You and me both.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.295
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

20:02.334 --> 20:03.334
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª
hey.
Alan,

20:03.336 --> 20:05.102
What is the one thing

20:05.104 --> 20:06.871
You've never gotten
from your mother?

20:06.873 --> 20:09.173
Uh, let's see, uh,
love, respect,

20:09.175 --> 20:11.609
A home-cooked meal,
breast milk, um...

20:11.611 --> 20:14.378
Okay, this is gonna
take too long.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.713
Approval.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.348
Wait, are-are you
trying to tell me

20:17.350 --> 20:18.950
Ms. Mcmartin
approved us to adopt?

20:18.952 --> 20:20.685
Yeah.
Oh, my god.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.886
Oh, my god,
that's great.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.621
(laughs)
I am really happy for you.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.990
Thank you. I-I couldn't
have done this without you.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.993
And so, to say thank you,
I got you a little something.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.362
Oh, you didn't have to.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.830
Oh, my god.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.233
Tickets to the <i>grease</i>
<i>sing-along at the bowl.</i>

20:35.235 --> 20:36.500
You can take anyone you want.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.202
â™ª you're the one that I want
aw!

20:38.204 --> 20:41.372
â™ª you are the one I want,
ooh, ooh, ooh, honey â™ª

20:41.374 --> 20:43.374
Fine.

20:43.376 --> 20:46.143
â™ª we'll go together
like... â™ª (laughs)

20:46.145 --> 20:49.213
Oh, my god, I'm turning
into my husband.
