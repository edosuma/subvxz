00:17.843 --> 00:23.319
-

00:52.713 --> 00:53.712
On your knees.

00:54.814 --> 00:56.451
Now, goddamn it!

01:50.375 --> 01:57.314
away from home

02:16.899 --> 02:23.373
make it through

02:30.378 --> 02:32.613
Wow, this place looks amazing.

02:33.385 --> 02:35.880
Yeah, it is, right?

02:37.455 --> 02:39.719
My dad used to spend a lot of
time here as a kid.

02:41.393 --> 02:44.328
I'd love to join you, but
I have a serious allergy

02:44.363 --> 02:45.857
to anything that involves bugs.

02:45.892 --> 02:47.496
Yes, I know.

02:47.531 --> 02:49.234
I get it.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.763
It's okay.

02:50.798 --> 02:52.369
This is something I need
to do on my own.

02:53.867 --> 02:55.207
Thanks for driving.

02:55.242 --> 02:56.472
Anytime.

03:01.044 --> 03:02.709
If you don't hear from me
in a few hours,

03:02.744 --> 03:04.282
call search and rescue, okay?

03:04.317 --> 03:05.943
- Seriously?
- No, I'm kidding.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.583
I'll call you
on the way back down.

03:08.618 --> 03:09.848
We'll make it to
Atlanta tonight.

03:09.883 --> 03:11.586
Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

04:09.613 --> 04:13.945
-

04:42.679 --> 04:47.682
-

05:12.775 --> 05:15.842
Dear Dad, I did it.

05:15.877 --> 05:18.944
I made it up the trail.
Almost at the top.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.453
I took some great photos to
remember this place by.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.918
I was gonna write this letter
and leave it up here with you,

05:26.487 --> 05:29.691
but now there's a thunderstorm
and something just feels...

05:30.155 --> 05:31.363
feels off.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.091
I don't know if I can
do this now.

05:34.927 --> 05:37.765
I'm not quitting or anything.
I promise.

05:38.601 --> 05:41.065
I'm just not sure I'm truly
ready to say goodbye.

05:42.937 --> 05:43.969
Maybe the storm is a sign

05:44.004 --> 05:45.773
I should come back
another day?

05:46.875 --> 05:48.644
I wish you could
talk to me now.

05:49.746 --> 05:50.745
Guess it's up to me.

06:35.528 --> 06:36.626
Welcome back.

07:43.530 --> 07:47.961
-

07:51.098 --> 07:56.541
all suffering

08:11.085 --> 08:18.090
guiding me home

08:21.260 --> 08:22.732
You waitin' for somebody?

08:27.134 --> 08:28.540
Get in.

08:51.059 --> 08:52.058
All right!

08:53.061 --> 08:54.192
Business first.

08:54.694 --> 08:56.733
You know I just can't
control myself

08:56.768 --> 08:58.130
when you're in that uniform.

09:04.006 --> 09:05.808
All right, Jimmy!

09:08.142 --> 09:09.141
What do you got for me?

09:22.629 --> 09:23.925
You're four stacks short.

09:27.898 --> 09:29.194
It was a tough month.

09:30.030 --> 09:35.134
Don't worry, I still got
your little side cut in full.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.676
- Right here.
- Get the fuck back.

09:38.711 --> 09:41.272
You know I can't go back to Hank
four stacks short!

09:44.310 --> 09:45.650
It is what it is.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.883
You need to be able
to move this.

09:48.218 --> 09:50.116
I'm tryin'. It ain't easy.

09:50.151 --> 09:52.118
Or should I just stop seizin'
it for you?

09:52.153 --> 09:53.286
Baby, you know the deal.

09:53.321 --> 09:56.793
We guarantee the product and
you guarantee the distro.

09:56.828 --> 09:57.827
I know.

09:58.629 --> 10:00.192
I'll get you more
money next week.

10:03.164 --> 10:05.967
Now, how much stuff can you get
for me this month, baby?

10:06.398 --> 10:07.705
Come on.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.675
Get your fuckin'
hand off my leg.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.336
Come on, baby.
-  I'm over this shit!

10:12.371 --> 10:14.976
Read the room, Jimmy.
Ya fucked up.

10:15.244 --> 10:16.681
Hand me a brick.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.111
You serious?

10:18.146 --> 10:20.685
Wanna play it that way? Fine.

10:37.836 --> 10:38.835
Hold that.

10:46.042 --> 10:47.074
Bag that up for me.

10:48.407 --> 10:49.406
It's not right.

10:52.950 --> 10:55.082
Looks like I'm gonna need to
find myself a new partner

10:55.117 --> 10:56.281
and I'm gonna need samples.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.055
What are we talkin' here?

11:01.794 --> 11:02.793
Just the coke?

11:04.863 --> 11:06.390
Or the meth and the heroin, too?

11:07.734 --> 11:08.733
Details?

11:09.769 --> 11:12.033
Details? Are you fuckin'
serious?

11:12.435 --> 11:13.771
What the fuck is wrong
with you today?

11:13.806 --> 11:15.036
That's not how we talk.

11:15.071 --> 11:16.400
That's not what we do.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.440
Cell phones off when we meet!

11:23.475 --> 11:24.881
You know the protocol!

11:27.479 --> 11:28.280
What the fuck?

11:30.251 --> 11:32.317
You fuckin' recordin' me, Jimmy?

12:33.512 --> 12:35.952
Fuck!

13:22.495 --> 13:24.528
The old cabin looks good.

13:25.465 --> 13:26.871
It's seen some changes.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.874
Daddy's always fixin'
this or that.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.535
He'll be back in a month and...

13:32.170 --> 13:34.010
he's lookin' forward to seein'
his big brother.

13:34.045 --> 13:35.176
How's dispatch?

13:35.511 --> 13:37.915
Excitin' as usual.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.543
Got a call about a nasty
possum the other day.

13:39.578 --> 13:41.347
You know, important
stuff like that.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.284
How you doin', Uncle Jack?

13:46.123 --> 13:48.024
It's okay if you don't
wanna talk about it.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.554
It's only been
three weeks and...

13:51.223 --> 13:52.963
it's only natural to
feel like that.

13:59.202 --> 14:00.465
32 years.

14:03.470 --> 14:04.601
Feels like it's yesterday.

14:06.572 --> 14:07.945
She was an amazing woman.

14:12.380 --> 14:13.445
I feel your loss.

14:13.847 --> 14:16.085
It'll take some gettin'
used to for sure.

14:16.582 --> 14:17.581
Yeah.

14:18.350 --> 14:21.552
Don't worry, the country'll
be good for you.

14:22.388 --> 14:25.424
This lake? It has a way of
healin' things.

14:32.565 --> 14:33.564
Uncle Jack!

14:34.666 --> 14:36.567
Hey, sport. How you doin'?

14:36.602 --> 14:38.503
- Good.
- Nice to see you.

14:39.038 --> 14:40.978
Gettin' bigger by the minute.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.474
You look kinda sad.

14:45.512 --> 14:46.918
I have something for you.

14:49.351 --> 14:50.581
A new video game.

14:50.616 --> 14:51.989
- That's for you.
- Awesome!

14:52.391 --> 14:53.419
Thanks, Uncle Jack.

14:59.559 --> 15:03.330
What's a city guy like me
supposed to do around here?

15:04.630 --> 15:05.629
You hear that?

15:08.139 --> 15:10.139
Exactly. Nothin'.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.175
It's just peace and quiet.

15:13.544 --> 15:14.539
Enjoy it.

15:15.542 --> 15:17.608
Go fishin', take a hike.

15:19.183 --> 15:20.644
Just get some fresh air in ya.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.989
Yes. A hike.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.254
Just don't take your cell phone.

15:26.289 --> 15:27.618
It'll distract you.

15:27.653 --> 15:29.389
Reception's spotty anyway.

15:35.463 --> 15:36.627
You might want that, though.

15:39.764 --> 15:40.972
Bears.

15:42.206 --> 15:44.074
- Bears?
- Just in case.

16:20.409 --> 16:21.573
Who's there?

16:27.119 --> 16:28.118
Hey!

16:29.781 --> 16:32.188
- Hey!
-

16:33.290 --> 16:35.455
Stop runnin' and
come back here now!

16:44.763 --> 16:46.268
You have the Sheriff's Office.

16:46.303 --> 16:47.269
We got a problem.

16:49.570 --> 16:52.703
Then I said, "That might be
a little dangerous."

16:53.272 --> 16:57.015
Then she said, "I'm not talkin'
about your pistol.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.676
I'm talkin' about your piece."

17:03.088 --> 17:05.485
- True story. True story.
- Hank. Hank.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.586
- Yeah?
- You're gonna wanna take this.

17:07.788 --> 17:08.785
It's Billie.

17:16.696 --> 17:17.695
Doesn't sound good.

17:19.666 --> 17:21.699
She might be cryin',
I don't know.

17:21.734 --> 17:23.767
- Line one?
- Mm-hmm.

17:24.770 --> 17:25.569
Billie, talk.

17:25.604 --> 17:27.606
I had to let go
of an asset today.

17:29.379 --> 17:30.840
Come again, Billie?

17:30.875 --> 17:32.809
And we have an unintended.

17:32.844 --> 17:33.910
Oh God!

17:33.945 --> 17:36.120
Anyone else see you out there?

17:36.155 --> 17:37.451
No, sir.

17:37.486 --> 17:38.650
Are you sure?

17:38.685 --> 17:39.684
Yeah, I'm sure!

17:40.219 --> 17:43.325
And, uh, where is the asset?

17:43.360 --> 17:45.162
Secure. Under the car.

17:46.198 --> 17:47.824
Whose car?

17:47.859 --> 17:49.166
The asset's car, y'all.

17:49.201 --> 17:50.299
I'm not an idiot.

17:51.830 --> 17:53.830
He sure as hell ain't
under my car.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.799
Jesus, Billie, watch your words.

17:56.001 --> 17:57.735
Will you relax, Tommy?

17:58.637 --> 18:00.738
It's contained. I pulled the car
off the shoulder.

18:00.773 --> 18:01.772
It's behind a bush.

18:02.508 --> 18:04.214
It's not visible
from the road.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.447
Any word on the unintended?

18:06.782 --> 18:08.614
No, she took off runnin'
like a bull

18:08.649 --> 18:09.780
with its balls cut off.

18:09.815 --> 18:10.880
I don't know where
the fuck she went.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.288
Whoa. She?

18:13.357 --> 18:15.357
What the...

18:15.659 --> 18:16.491
It was a woman, no question.

18:16.593 --> 18:19.196
Okay. All right, look.
I know that area.

18:19.231 --> 18:20.725
There's only three
obvious exit points

18:20.760 --> 18:22.298
she might try to get to.

18:23.433 --> 18:24.762
You just close one of 'em off.

18:25.464 --> 18:27.699
- Tommy, get movin'.
- Yeah, copy that.

18:27.734 --> 18:28.799
All right.

18:28.834 --> 18:30.306
Billie, stay on her.

18:30.341 --> 18:31.670
Tommy's leavin' right now.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.510
All right, I'm on my way out.

18:36.545 --> 18:38.182
All right.
Oh, wait, Tommy.

18:38.217 --> 18:39.381
- What?
- Take a couple posters

18:39.416 --> 18:40.514
out there with you, too.

18:40.549 --> 18:41.845
One more thing, Billie.

18:42.314 --> 18:43.517
Yeah?

18:48.755 --> 18:51.657
No more unintendeds. Understand?

19:01.933 --> 19:03.372
- Fuck!
-

20:51.845 --> 20:52.844
Shit.

21:03.087 --> 21:04.823
Jesus, Jimmy, what'd you do?

21:12.602 --> 21:16.703
Look at this shit.

21:34.921 --> 21:37.394
- Talk to me.
- Yeah, it's like she described.

21:37.829 --> 21:39.594
Out of view?
- Mm-hmm.

21:39.629 --> 21:40.695
A mess?

21:40.730 --> 21:43.697
Eh, a little bit. Not too bad.

21:45.602 --> 21:48.064
Okay, recover the goods

21:48.099 --> 21:49.769
and then see if you can
flush out the girl.

21:50.171 --> 21:51.738
All right, copy that.

21:51.773 --> 21:53.003
Tommy.

21:53.038 --> 21:53.937
Yeah, Hank?

21:53.973 --> 21:55.676
I want you takin'
the lead on this one.

21:56.245 --> 21:59.042
Billie's been a bit
shaky lately.

21:59.377 --> 22:01.352
- You understand?
- Yup.

22:01.387 --> 22:02.815
Tommy.

22:02.850 --> 22:03.849
What, Hank?

22:04.351 --> 22:06.555
Don't you make me have to
come out there.

22:06.790 --> 22:09.690
- Copy that, Hank.
-  Oh, Tommy?

22:09.725 --> 22:11.054
Jesus Christ, Hank,
what do you want?

22:12.497 --> 22:13.859
Don't forget the posters.

22:22.001 --> 22:23.770
"Don't forget the posters.

22:24.372 --> 22:26.102
Don't forget the posters."

22:27.072 --> 22:28.478
Fuckin' dickhead.

22:41.152 --> 22:42.085
Sweet dreams, Jimmy.

22:43.055 --> 22:44.054
Shit.

23:04.010 --> 23:05.977
What a waste of good shit.

23:12.821 --> 23:13.820
Fuck it.

23:25.064 --> 23:26.866
"Don't forget the posters."

23:55.501 --> 23:56.632
Woo!

24:01.199 --> 24:03.001
Goodbye. Have fun, Uncle Jack!

24:03.036 --> 24:04.541
We'll be back in a week
to check on ya.

24:04.576 --> 24:06.004
Thanks, Uncle Jack!

24:08.910 --> 24:10.613
-

24:37.235 --> 24:40.511
Listen, I don't know
what you think you saw,

24:40.546 --> 24:41.743
but I'm a cop, all right?

24:43.307 --> 24:44.515
I ain't gonna hurt you.

24:51.590 --> 24:52.919
I know you can hear me!

24:56.188 --> 24:58.056
Come on out and talk to me,
okay?

25:07.606 --> 25:09.232
Look, what's your plan?

25:11.236 --> 25:13.874
Think you're gonna get outta
here and then call the cops?

25:13.909 --> 25:15.777
Who you think's gonna
respond to that?

25:17.308 --> 25:19.275
My people, my crew, that's who.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.080
So let's just make this easy.

25:25.217 --> 25:26.986
I'm gonna put my gun away now,
all right?

25:39.231 --> 25:40.637
Don't shoot, please.

25:41.299 --> 25:42.804
Please. I'm so sorry.

25:42.839 --> 25:43.838
It's okay.

25:44.106 --> 25:45.576
I panicked. I panicked.

25:45.611 --> 25:47.039
I--I just got scared.

25:47.074 --> 25:48.810
And I panicked. I'm sorry.
I heard a shot, that's it.

25:48.845 --> 25:50.240
It's okay, I just need
you to calm down.

25:50.275 --> 25:51.241
Take a deep breath.

25:51.276 --> 25:53.111
I was just hiking.
I don't want any trouble.

25:53.146 --> 25:54.145
Please, please.

25:55.014 --> 25:57.247
Just gonna calm down.
We're gonna stay put.

25:59.823 --> 26:01.251
Okay.
- Okay.

26:04.696 --> 26:06.256
Just gonna get you
back to my car.

26:06.458 --> 26:08.126
We're gonna just talk.
Is that okay?

26:08.361 --> 26:09.093
Okay.
- Okay.

26:09.129 --> 26:10.667
Okay.
- All right.

26:10.702 --> 26:11.965
Okay.Calm down.

26:12.300 --> 26:13.164
It's okay.

26:14.233 --> 26:15.672
It's okay.

26:15.707 --> 26:16.706
It's okay.

26:18.006 --> 26:19.203
Okay.

26:21.779 --> 26:22.877
Billie, I'm here now.

26:26.378 --> 26:28.014
Did you find that stray cat

26:28.049 --> 26:29.180
and put her down?

26:29.782 --> 26:32.150
-

26:35.353 --> 26:37.023
Billie, are you there?

26:39.192 --> 26:41.258
Tommy, I got her.
I'm just up that hill. Hurry up.

26:41.293 --> 26:42.633
I'll be up in a second.

26:42.668 --> 26:44.360
-

26:44.395 --> 26:45.194
Fuck!

26:45.229 --> 26:47.231
-

26:55.978 --> 26:57.208
Batter up.

27:04.921 --> 27:06.217
Come on.

27:22.873 --> 27:23.938
She's a slippery one.

27:27.574 --> 27:29.746
- Nice fuckin' work.
- Yeah.

27:31.277 --> 27:32.749
Shit, what the hell
happened to you?

27:34.412 --> 27:36.016
She's tougher than she looks.

27:38.922 --> 27:40.152
So what now?

27:40.354 --> 27:42.924
- Come get this off me.
- Take care of that wound.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.224
Hank said to use caution.

27:46.826 --> 27:48.930
Get some information
from this chick.

27:48.965 --> 27:50.393
We'll figure out how to proceed.

27:52.870 --> 27:54.771
You remember that time
when we were kids?

27:55.006 --> 27:56.905
You tried to get fresh with me

27:56.940 --> 27:58.742
after your kid brother
dared you?

27:59.144 --> 28:01.778
I ended up bitin'
the hell outta your hand.

28:01.980 --> 28:03.274
Cried for about a day.

28:06.378 --> 28:07.751
I'd forgotten all about that

28:08.553 --> 28:10.413
till this bitch got her
teeth into me.

28:16.091 --> 28:17.794
Not much has changed with you.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.292
Still doin' all your
brother's dirty work.

28:21.327 --> 28:23.426
Oh shit, and you turned
out just great?

28:24.902 --> 28:27.331
Fallin' for a convict
doin' 40 years?

28:27.366 --> 28:28.970
Single mom?

28:29.005 --> 28:31.071
Know you're lucky
I got you this job.

28:31.106 --> 28:32.303
Who knows what you'd be doin'.

28:33.239 --> 28:37.748
Look at you now, all chewed up
by some city girl.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.080
Fuck you for sayin' that, Tommy.

28:40.115 --> 28:41.114
Know what, Billie?

28:41.150 --> 28:42.918
Maybe you'd been better off
lettin' me hook up

28:42.953 --> 28:44.150
with you back then.

28:44.819 --> 28:46.955
We could have gone a whole
different way together.

28:47.793 --> 28:49.386
Don't you wish you had.

28:58.331 --> 28:59.330
Oh shit.

29:01.466 --> 29:02.773
Little worm is movin'.

29:04.172 --> 29:05.908
Oh, let her come to.

29:07.472 --> 29:08.471
You go first.

29:09.947 --> 29:12.178
All right, calm down. Calm down.

29:12.884 --> 29:14.510
Hey, calm down!

29:14.812 --> 29:18.217
All we need to know is what you
think you saw, baby.

29:18.752 --> 29:20.318
So, I'm gonna take
this off you now.

29:20.353 --> 29:22.122
Don't scream.

29:22.157 --> 29:24.454
I'll say I saw

29:24.489 --> 29:25.688
whatever you want me to say.

29:25.724 --> 29:29.129
I'll say--I'll say that I saw
whatever you want me to say.

29:29.164 --> 29:31.835
I will, I'll say it was
a drug bust, okay?

29:32.037 --> 29:33.870
- That's what I'll say.
- I'm sure, hon.

29:33.905 --> 29:36.004
It's just that your response...

29:36.840 --> 29:39.172
suggests that you saw somethin'
you shouldn't have.

29:39.507 --> 29:43.374
I mean, if it were me and
I hadn't seen anything

29:44.343 --> 29:47.015
I'd be here screamin' that
some crazy cops

29:47.050 --> 29:48.511
just started chasin' me
through the woods

29:48.546 --> 29:49.479
for no good reason.

29:49.814 --> 29:51.888
I'd be damn confident about it.

29:51.923 --> 29:54.121
No, no. Please, please.

29:54.156 --> 29:55.584
Shh.

29:55.619 --> 29:58.092
But you weren't very confident.

29:58.527 --> 29:59.863
And that just don't work for us.

30:00.565 --> 30:02.866
Please, I'll say whatever you
want me to say, please.

30:03.401 --> 30:05.429
- Please?
- Do we need to call in Hank?

30:07.633 --> 30:09.499
No, we ain't gotta do that.

30:10.068 --> 30:12.403
Well then do what you gotta do.

30:15.573 --> 30:17.441
- What are you waitin' for?
- Fuck me.

30:18.143 --> 30:20.246
I lost my damn
pistol back there.

30:21.183 --> 30:22.446
Huh?

30:22.481 --> 30:23.579
When she bit me!

30:24.815 --> 30:25.414
- Are you fuckin' with me?
- No, I'm not fuckin' with you.

30:25.449 --> 30:27.352
I was a little distracted!

30:27.387 --> 30:28.892
Jesus Christ, Billie.

30:28.927 --> 30:30.322
Goddamn it, use my gun.

30:31.158 --> 30:32.962
Ya know what,
let's take her up to the marsh

30:32.997 --> 30:34.359
so we can hide her after.

30:34.394 --> 30:35.558
- Fuck.
- I like that idea.

30:35.893 --> 30:38.594
- Damn it.
- All right, get up.

30:38.629 --> 30:40.101
- Come on, get up.
- Come on, baby.

30:40.136 --> 30:41.498
- Calm down.
- Get up goddamn it!

30:47.077 --> 30:48.879
- Get on your knees!

30:54.249 --> 30:56.051
Hang tight.
I'll make sure we're alone.

30:59.518 --> 31:00.551
Please, I'm begging you.

31:00.586 --> 31:02.255
Please, please, please,
you don't have to do this.

31:02.290 --> 31:03.520
I promise I won't say anything.

31:03.555 --> 31:05.093
Please!

31:07.999 --> 31:10.197
Please, please,
somebody help me!

31:10.232 --> 31:11.462
Please!

31:18.009 --> 31:20.944
Please, please, somebody
help me! Please!

31:27.018 --> 31:29.117
All right, Billie. Do it!

31:39.162 --> 31:40.590
What are you waitin' for,
Billie?

31:40.625 --> 31:42.295
Somebody help me, please!

31:42.497 --> 31:43.659
- Please.
-  Billie, do it.

31:46.136 --> 31:47.102
Do it, Billie!

31:47.137 --> 31:49.137
Please, please, please.

31:49.700 --> 31:50.941
Please.

31:56.212 --> 31:58.146
I can't shoot her when
she's lookin' me

31:58.181 --> 31:59.378
in the eyes like that, Tommy.

32:01.580 --> 32:03.481
Jesus Christ, Billie,
what's wrong with you?

32:03.983 --> 32:05.318
Point the gun at her.

32:20.335 --> 32:22.236
All right, we're gonna
do it on three.

32:23.371 --> 32:24.370
One.

32:26.737 --> 32:27.538
Two.

32:31.348 --> 32:33.379
- Oh, shit.

32:36.417 --> 32:37.988
You hear that?
Over here. Come on.

32:39.057 --> 32:40.485
Don't fuckin' move.

32:43.721 --> 32:45.996
You hear that? Came from there.

32:46.691 --> 32:47.723
Right in there.

32:49.397 --> 32:50.396
Don't move!

32:54.402 --> 32:56.270
Throw your gun as
far as you can.

32:57.669 --> 32:58.668
Throw it!

33:00.111 --> 33:03.211
Hey, I'm not sure how your
eyesight is, pal.

33:03.446 --> 33:04.542
We're the Sheriff's Department.

33:05.776 --> 33:06.577
I see that.

33:08.218 --> 33:10.185
But shit don't go
down like this.

33:12.651 --> 33:13.551
On your knees.

33:14.752 --> 33:16.224
Now, goddamn it!

33:26.302 --> 33:31.602
I'm a cop, 35 years,
so don't be stupid.

33:33.111 --> 33:34.110
What happened?

33:34.779 --> 33:37.014
She assaulted me.
She's some sorta junkie.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.280
They're lying.
She murdered someone.

33:39.315 --> 33:40.644
She's a fuckin' liar!

33:42.648 --> 33:44.318
Everybody calm down.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.222
Here's what we're gonna do.

33:48.786 --> 33:51.358
We're all goin' down to
the police station.

33:51.660 --> 33:53.393
We're gonna figure this out.

33:53.661 --> 33:55.593
Yeah, that sounds like
a plan to me.

33:56.362 --> 33:58.266
Hey, Billie, be a doll
and get my gun.

33:58.468 --> 33:59.564
Don't you move.

33:59.799 --> 34:03.403
If this guy's a cop,
by golly I think he is,

34:03.772 --> 34:05.405
he's not gonna shoot
another cop.

34:05.440 --> 34:06.802
Don't fuck around.

34:07.404 --> 34:08.804
I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do.

34:08.839 --> 34:09.805
I'm gonna stand up.

34:10.374 --> 34:12.148
If this jackass
doesn't shoot me,

34:12.783 --> 34:15.118
Billie, get my fuckin' gun.

34:19.256 --> 34:22.653
Yeah, thought so.

34:23.656 --> 34:24.721
Billie, go.

34:24.756 --> 34:26.129
Run.

34:28.463 --> 34:29.792
Run, damn it!

34:29.827 --> 34:30.760
- Now.
- Go.

34:30.795 --> 34:32.102
Go, Billie.

34:33.435 --> 34:35.600
- Go!
-

34:45.150 --> 34:46.677
That's some great shootin'.

34:46.712 --> 34:47.843
Just give me the fuckin' gun.

34:47.878 --> 34:49.647
Shut the fuck up.

34:49.682 --> 34:51.814
Clean up your fuckin'
brass and let's go.

34:54.687 --> 34:55.686
What about them?

34:56.255 --> 34:57.754
Just clean up your tracks.

34:58.123 --> 35:00.724
Don't worry, we'll find 'em.

35:15.873 --> 35:16.839
Wait for me.

35:21.813 --> 35:24.187
Fuckin' bugs out here
are ridiculous.

35:26.356 --> 35:27.685
Shit, it's hot.

35:29.854 --> 35:31.722
You think we oughta call Hank?

35:31.757 --> 35:34.758
Oh, Billie, I think Hank's
the last person

35:34.793 --> 35:36.892
you wanna be hearin' from
right about now.

35:37.895 --> 35:40.335
You think he'll be real mad?

35:40.370 --> 35:42.700
Does the Tin Man have
a sheet metal cock?

36:17.374 --> 36:18.967
Where'd you go?

36:52.772 --> 36:53.804
Fuck.

37:02.947 --> 37:03.781
Where are ya?

37:15.927 --> 37:20.435
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

37:23.638 --> 37:24.703
What was that?

37:25.038 --> 37:26.276
Think it came from that way.

37:26.311 --> 37:27.310
Go check it out.

37:29.006 --> 37:30.379
What the hell are you gonna do?

37:30.981 --> 37:33.448
Shit, I'm gonna go this way.
Call me if anything happens.

37:33.483 --> 37:35.648
- Okay, I'll do the same.
- What?

37:35.950 --> 37:37.485
Yeah, maybe they split up, okay?

37:37.520 --> 37:38.750
We gotta cover our asses.

37:39.885 --> 37:40.917
Give me your gun.

37:41.185 --> 37:42.523
Oh, that's a good idea.

37:42.791 --> 37:43.790
Hell no!

37:43.826 --> 37:46.527
- Tommy, give me your gun!
- Hey, you lost it.

37:46.562 --> 37:47.891
Go find it. Shit.

37:48.860 --> 37:51.059
'Bout to find me a new job,
that's what I'm about to do.

37:51.094 --> 37:52.698
I'm done with this shit.

37:53.167 --> 37:54.799
Big fuckin' dick.

37:54.834 --> 37:58.539
-

38:07.748 --> 38:09.484
Honey, I can hear you in there.

38:10.586 --> 38:12.322
Come on out, now.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.330
Got the girl.

38:21.025 --> 38:22.024
Gonna find out.

38:23.764 --> 38:24.763
Where's your friend?

38:25.065 --> 38:26.061
Where's your gun?

38:28.703 --> 38:29.867
Listen, girl.

38:31.136 --> 38:33.541
In this good cop, bad cop thing
I'm the good cop, all right?

38:33.576 --> 38:35.037
I'm the good cop!

38:35.072 --> 38:38.381
So move your ass,
or I'm gonna have to make you.

38:42.684 --> 38:45.388
Fine, have it your way.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.423
-

38:53.596 --> 38:56.894
Fuck.

39:04.035 --> 39:05.034
Mm-hmm?

39:05.536 --> 39:06.937
That bitch stabbed me!

39:07.406 --> 39:09.379
Jesus Christ, Billie.

39:09.414 --> 39:11.447
I gotta ask ya, how many times
ya gonna fuck up today?

39:11.482 --> 39:12.778
Now, Tommy!

39:13.080 --> 39:15.484
I'm fuckin' bleedin'
over here.

39:15.752 --> 39:16.881
I can still see her.

39:16.916 --> 39:18.487
There's a shed
at the fork in the road.

39:18.918 --> 39:20.082
Hurry!

39:22.955 --> 39:23.954
What the fuck?

39:26.728 --> 39:29.597
Shit. There goes happy hour.

40:08.473 --> 40:09.868
Fuckin' Billie.

40:29.087 --> 40:30.955
Tommy!

40:57.984 --> 40:59.555
This can't be happening.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.084
This can't be real.

41:25.682 --> 41:27.209
Shit, that looks bad, Billie.

41:28.718 --> 41:30.850
I'm bleedin' pretty bad, Tommy.

41:30.885 --> 41:31.884
Which way they go?

41:34.317 --> 41:36.218
That way. They're not far.

41:36.957 --> 41:37.956
Shit.

41:40.224 --> 41:41.223
You okay?

41:45.801 --> 41:47.196
Gotta get you outta here.

41:48.232 --> 41:49.737
Tommy, you gotta listen to me.

41:50.406 --> 41:56.645
Jimmy, that rat fuck,
he's been recordin', okay?

41:57.447 --> 41:59.813
The feds are gonna be all

42:00.115 --> 42:03.784
We're fucked.

42:06.888 --> 42:08.151
Tommy, I'm not feelin' so good.

42:08.186 --> 42:09.889
All right, get you outta here.

42:10.991 --> 42:12.595
I think we oughta call
your brother.

42:12.997 --> 42:14.256
He's already on his way.

42:14.962 --> 42:16.159
That's good.

42:16.832 --> 42:17.963
Come on.

42:17.998 --> 42:20.163

42:23.839 --> 42:26.235

42:27.843 --> 42:30.074
Yeah, be just fine.

43:03.747 --> 43:06.308
It's okay. It's just me,
just me.

43:06.343 --> 43:07.980
It's me, I'm not gonna hurt you.

43:08.015 --> 43:09.278
I'm not gonna hurt you.

43:09.313 --> 43:12.688
Just...just let me help, okay?

43:13.889 --> 43:14.888
Sit on the rock.

43:15.957 --> 43:16.956
Okay.

43:21.798 --> 43:23.325
I didn't do anything wrong.
I was just hiking.

43:29.267 --> 43:30.266
I believe you.

43:33.172 --> 43:35.073
You don't look
like a criminal to me.

43:38.177 --> 43:41.211
If we got to know each other,
maybe it would help.

43:42.379 --> 43:43.818
Just the basics.

43:47.351 --> 43:50.726
My name is Jack, Jack Harris.

43:52.158 --> 43:53.256
I'm a cop.

43:58.164 --> 43:59.163
My wife, uh...

44:01.101 --> 44:03.332
uh, um...

44:04.709 --> 44:08.238
she died three weeks ago.

44:11.309 --> 44:13.078
Uh, cancer, yeah.

44:15.753 --> 44:16.851
That's why I'm here.

44:20.450 --> 44:21.757
Early retirement.

44:27.061 --> 44:28.324
My name is Shannon Mathers.

44:29.393 --> 44:30.392
I capture images.

44:33.034 --> 44:34.033
Images?

44:35.432 --> 44:36.871
I'm a photojournalist.

44:39.238 --> 44:40.237
I, um...

44:40.706 --> 44:44.978
I...I guess I came out here
to prove my father wrong.

44:47.477 --> 44:50.346
He grew up around here.
He...he really loved it.

44:54.759 --> 44:57.056
He always said these woods
were too tough for me,

44:59.423 --> 45:00.422
too hard to hike.

45:02.767 --> 45:04.459
He used to call me
his little quitter.

45:07.431 --> 45:09.332
Well, let's prove him wrong.

45:12.007 --> 45:13.006
He's dead, Jack.

45:15.912 --> 45:17.813
I came out here to
spread his ashes.

45:20.444 --> 45:22.312
I just couldn't make it to
the place where he wanted them.

45:22.914 --> 45:26.448
So, I guess he was right.

45:27.418 --> 45:29.286
It's just too fucking much.

45:32.159 --> 45:33.290
I'm sorry.

45:36.493 --> 45:38.966
Shannon, I think we have
something in common.

45:41.432 --> 45:42.805
What's that?

45:44.842 --> 45:47.337
We shouldn't have come
to this fucking place.

45:50.375 --> 45:51.473
You got a phone?

45:53.543 --> 45:54.850
It's back with my stuff.

45:58.251 --> 45:59.789
Shannon, you can trust me.

46:01.518 --> 46:03.122
What we need is evidence.

46:05.291 --> 46:06.356
I need my camera.

46:07.458 --> 46:08.996
I have footage.

46:09.031 --> 46:10.426
Everything that you
need to know is on there.

46:10.995 --> 46:12.461
It's back with my things.

46:18.304 --> 46:19.303
Get the camera.

46:20.372 --> 46:21.503
Bring it back.

46:21.538 --> 46:23.142
We'll meet back here.

46:23.177 --> 46:27.047
I'm gonna get back to
my cabin to get my phone.

46:28.512 --> 46:31.183
I know someone
who can help us.

46:36.388 --> 46:39.092
Shannon there's no quitting now,
you understand?

46:39.360 --> 46:40.489
Okay.

47:07.925 --> 47:09.584
- I can't go anymore.
- Come on, we're almost--

47:09.619 --> 47:12.191
- I can't go anymore, Tommy.
- Come on, Billie.

47:12.226 --> 47:13.489
- I can't!
- We're almost outta here.

47:13.524 --> 47:14.424
You gotta lay me down.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.493
All right, here.
I'm puttin' you down here.

47:27.637 --> 47:29.406
Oh, hey, brother.

47:30.041 --> 47:32.948
Hey. Shit just got
outta control.

47:33.951 --> 47:35.148
Let's see what we got.

47:37.922 --> 47:39.449
Oh.

47:42.322 --> 47:45.928
Chief, we gotta get goin'.

47:46.297 --> 47:48.029
Oh, Billie.

47:48.231 --> 47:50.427
Chief, you gotta help me.

47:50.896 --> 47:53.595
Well, that's somethin'.

47:54.364 --> 47:56.906
What the fuck are you doin'
just lookin' at it?

47:56.941 --> 47:58.303
We gotta go!

48:00.571 --> 48:02.571
Billie, you just stay strong,
okay?

48:04.278 --> 48:05.277
All right.

48:08.612 --> 48:10.183
Where are you goin'?

48:13.320 --> 48:15.155
- She's lookin' pretty bad.

48:18.193 --> 48:19.489
Yeah.

48:19.924 --> 48:22.327
We got some serious
time constraints here.

48:24.661 --> 48:27.266
I know you guys
are close but, um,

48:27.301 --> 48:29.433
well, she's in bad shape, okay?

48:29.468 --> 48:31.270
And by the time we get
her outta here,

48:32.006 --> 48:36.374
chances are she ain't gonna
be with us anymore.

48:36.709 --> 48:39.542
In the meantime, them two
unintendeds will be long gone.

48:40.281 --> 48:41.544
Now, look.

48:41.579 --> 48:43.953
We got ourselves
a serious situation

48:43.988 --> 48:46.153
that needs resolvin', right?

48:46.188 --> 48:47.187
And quick.

48:49.059 --> 48:52.522
I told you not to call me,
didn't I?

48:53.157 --> 48:55.492
But now that you did, well...

48:57.133 --> 48:59.034
I think you know
what you have to do.

49:03.574 --> 49:04.699
She's got a little kid at home.

49:09.178 --> 49:11.673
Listen to me, Tommy,
and you listen good.

49:12.275 --> 49:14.346
I shouldn't be
out here right now.

49:14.381 --> 49:17.646
I am one goddamn week away
from that election and you are--

49:20.288 --> 49:22.684
and you are the first
in line for my spot

49:22.719 --> 49:24.257
once I get what's comin' to me.

49:25.722 --> 49:27.590
But this is your mess now,
too, brother.

49:27.625 --> 49:28.690
You understand, right?

49:29.459 --> 49:31.627
What, you think I didn't
have to get my hands

49:31.662 --> 49:33.464
a little bit dirty to
get where I am?

49:34.698 --> 49:36.599
Shit, you know what?

49:37.734 --> 49:39.305
If you really had what it took,

49:40.737 --> 49:42.539
you'd have already handled
this business by now.

49:43.113 --> 49:44.310
But, no.

49:44.745 --> 49:47.511
No, all you know how to do
is think with your dick.

49:50.219 --> 49:51.218
That's not true.

49:54.751 --> 49:55.684
I got what it takes.

49:55.719 --> 49:57.290
Then prove it, brother.

49:57.325 --> 49:59.688
Put her outta her misery
and then let's finish this

49:59.723 --> 50:02.361
before we actually have
a problem we can't fix.

50:05.696 --> 50:07.267
What do you want me to do?

50:09.139 --> 50:10.567
Shoot her in the fuckin' face?

50:11.801 --> 50:13.273
Fuckin' stupid, Tommy.

50:13.308 --> 50:14.703
She's bleedin' out.

50:14.738 --> 50:16.672
We got a murder weapon
with prints all over it.

50:16.707 --> 50:19.114
Now, this is a closed case
as far as you, I,

50:19.149 --> 50:20.577
or anyone will know.

50:21.513 --> 50:24.284
Just get your ass over there
and tend to that wound.

50:24.319 --> 50:25.318
Come on.

50:25.553 --> 50:26.517
Go on.

50:26.785 --> 50:28.123
Come on!

50:28.158 --> 50:29.157
Be all right.

50:34.824 --> 50:35.625
Go on.

50:42.469 --> 50:44.502
Tommy, I can't feel
my legs no more.

50:44.904 --> 50:46.504
You're gonna have to carry me.

50:46.806 --> 50:48.143
It's all right, Billie.

50:49.674 --> 50:50.739
You'll be okay.

50:51.874 --> 50:53.049
Sorry.

50:54.252 --> 50:55.348
- No, Tommy, what are you doin'?
-  Shh, just relax.

50:55.383 --> 50:56.514
- Shh.
- No.

50:56.813 --> 50:58.252
No!

50:58.650 --> 50:59.649
Shh, shh.

51:00.752 --> 51:01.651
- I got a son at home, Tommy.
-  It's okay.

51:02.820 --> 51:03.653
I'm gonna take care of him.
I'm gonna take care of it.

51:03.688 --> 51:05.325
I'll take care of everything,
okay?

51:05.527 --> 51:08.229
Fuckin' let me go, Tommy.

51:08.264 --> 51:09.857
Gonna be okay. Shh.

51:09.892 --> 51:11.826
No, Tommy.

51:11.861 --> 51:14.202
Stop fightin', Billie. Please.

51:15.469 --> 51:16.732
Just be still.

51:16.767 --> 51:19.108
I don't wanna die, Tommy.

51:20.771 --> 51:22.474
It's gonna be okay.

51:22.709 --> 51:25.774
- It's all right.
- Tommy, please, I'll do better.

51:25.809 --> 51:26.808
I promise.

51:27.911 --> 51:30.449
Sheriff thinks it's
too late for that now.

51:31.551 --> 51:33.320
It's gonna be okay.

51:33.655 --> 51:34.816
Just relax.

51:34.851 --> 51:36.785
It'll be over soon.

51:40.030 --> 51:42.494
Promise you'll
take care of my son.

51:43.530 --> 51:44.826
I love you, Billie.

51:51.868 --> 51:55.672
-

52:28.938 --> 52:30.476
Well done.

52:30.511 --> 52:31.708
I always knew you had it in ya.

52:36.913 --> 52:38.253
What are we gonna do now?

52:38.981 --> 52:40.156
We finish this.

52:41.522 --> 52:43.258
They been runnin'
for 10 minutes.

52:44.294 --> 52:45.359
Why are you so calm?

52:46.956 --> 52:48.626
'Cause that's part of it,
big brother.

52:48.928 --> 52:49.726
You'll see.

52:51.301 --> 52:52.828
Now, where do you think
they might be?

52:53.096 --> 52:54.566
I don't know.

52:56.438 --> 52:57.932
Off in the distance
I saw a cabin.

52:59.276 --> 53:00.572
That's where they're goin'.

53:01.905 --> 53:02.904
How do you know?

53:05.315 --> 53:09.581
Because unlike you,
I've got intuition, Tommy.

53:09.950 --> 53:11.220
It comes in handy.

53:12.652 --> 53:15.620
You see, I have
the ability to put myself

53:15.655 --> 53:19.294
in other people's shoes and
that's where I'd be goin'

53:19.329 --> 53:21.659
if I was on the run tryin'
to save my life.

53:23.729 --> 53:24.695
But you tell me.

53:25.797 --> 53:27.599
What's your workin' theory,
brother?

53:31.275 --> 53:32.340
That's what I thought.

53:34.443 --> 53:35.871
Get her back to the car.

53:35.906 --> 53:37.609
We have to set up the narrative.

53:38.078 --> 53:41.481
Take the weapon and we'll get
some prints off that thing.

53:41.516 --> 53:42.746
Gotta get it all in the car.

53:42.781 --> 53:44.583
I think we can make this work.

53:44.618 --> 53:45.617
What are you gonna do?

53:46.252 --> 53:48.389
Clean up your goddamn mess.

53:48.424 --> 53:49.786
We got work to do, big brother.

53:50.822 --> 53:54.329
Looks like we gots ourselves
a cop killer on the loose.

56:54.071 --> 56:55.070
You reached Tom.

56:55.106 --> 56:57.105
I'm not about to pick up
my phone right now.

56:57.140 --> 56:58.513
Leave a message.

56:58.548 --> 56:59.976
- Hi, Tommy.

57:01.012 --> 57:02.979
Hope your project's goin' well.

57:03.348 --> 57:05.520
Surprised I haven't heard
from you about it yet.

57:06.422 --> 57:09.656
But I suppose that just means
you're hard at work.

57:11.528 --> 57:12.989
Why don't you give us a call?

57:16.698 --> 57:19.468
-

57:55.638 --> 57:59.068
Billie, I'm gonna
make this right.

58:00.203 --> 58:01.576
You'll see.

58:48.284 --> 58:49.217
Ah.

59:47.211 --> 59:50.278
Dad, I really need your help.

59:51.347 --> 59:53.017
I'm all alone and I'm scared.

59:54.286 --> 59:58.220
Please, for the first time,
just tell me I can do this.

59:59.828 --> 1:00:00.827
Can you hear me?

1:00:03.227 --> 1:00:07.966
Just gimme a sign. Anything.

1:00:29.319 --> 1:00:34.256
-

1:00:46.875 --> 1:00:49.744
-  Freeze, goddamn it!

1:00:50.472 --> 1:00:51.647
Freeze!

1:00:52.342 --> 1:00:53.374
Stop.

1:00:53.409 --> 1:00:55.277
Fuckin' bitch. Stop!

1:00:58.249 --> 1:00:59.380
Bitch.

1:01:05.223 --> 1:01:06.255
Stop.

1:01:06.991 --> 1:01:09.423
-

1:01:14.936 --> 1:01:16.331
Bitch.

1:01:38.091 --> 1:01:40.355
You bitch, I'm gonna kill you.

1:01:43.833 --> 1:01:44.997
Goddamn it, freeze.

1:02:07.450 --> 1:02:09.285
-

1:02:10.255 --> 1:02:11.353
This is for Billie.

1:02:13.156 --> 1:02:15.357
Don't you know that
it's time to quit?

1:02:16.259 --> 1:02:18.294
He always said these
woods were too tough for me.

1:02:18.796 --> 1:02:20.329
He used to call me
his little quitter.

1:02:20.998 --> 1:02:24.300
I'm not quitting or anything.
I promise.

1:02:24.602 --> 1:02:26.841
Shannon there's no quitting.

1:02:27.305 --> 1:02:28.304
You understand?

1:02:29.505 --> 1:02:31.142
Then let's prove him wrong.

1:02:31.344 --> 1:02:33.540
Just gimme a sign. Anything.

1:02:33.575 --> 1:02:36.477
-

1:03:37.408 --> 1:03:38.274
Hey, Tommy.

1:03:38.309 --> 1:03:40.816
Things appear to be
a dead end for me.

1:03:41.251 --> 1:03:43.577
So, why don't we just
touch base ASAP, okay?

1:03:45.922 --> 1:03:46.954
Fuckin' moron.

1:03:49.123 --> 1:03:50.122
Huh.

1:03:51.554 --> 1:03:54.929
Lazy son of a bitch.

1:03:56.163 --> 1:03:57.558
You reached Tom.

1:03:57.593 --> 1:03:59.560
I'm not about to pick up
my phone right now.

1:03:59.595 --> 1:04:01.463
- Leave a message.
-

1:04:02.432 --> 1:04:04.598
I'm gonna need you to
call me back right now.

1:04:04.933 --> 1:04:06.270
You got that?

1:04:08.307 --> 1:04:10.538
Stupid fuckin' donkey.

1:04:54.188 --> 1:04:55.319
Well, you were here.

1:04:58.225 --> 1:04:59.521
Talk to me.

1:05:01.690 --> 1:05:02.898
Come on, goddamn it.

1:05:04.198 --> 1:05:05.197
Show me somethin'.

1:05:19.114 --> 1:05:20.311
Depression, huh?

1:05:20.646 --> 1:05:23.380
Well, that's a shame.

1:05:25.054 --> 1:05:26.680
What the hell are you doin'
all the way up here

1:05:26.715 --> 1:05:28.352
in my neck of the wood?

1:05:35.064 --> 1:05:36.327
Oh, you're sad.

1:05:43.204 --> 1:05:44.203
Shit.

1:05:48.044 --> 1:05:51.639
Well, looks like you're
way outta your jurisdiction,

1:05:51.674 --> 1:05:53.146
my friend.

1:06:10.099 --> 1:06:13.067
I'll be goddamned.

1:06:21.671 --> 1:06:22.978
-  31-21.

1:06:24.212 --> 1:06:25.277
31-21.

1:06:29.448 --> 1:06:30.579
Hey, dispatch,

1:06:30.614 --> 1:06:32.053
can you do me a big favor

1:06:32.088 --> 1:06:33.582
and patch me over to Pam Harris?

1:06:33.617 --> 1:06:34.715
Sure thing.

1:06:41.526 --> 1:06:42.624
Hello, sir.

1:06:42.659 --> 1:06:43.724
Hey, Pam!

1:06:45.398 --> 1:06:48.036
I'm so sorry to bother ya
on your day off.

1:06:48.071 --> 1:06:49.070
Hey, no worries.

1:06:50.239 --> 1:06:51.633
Just please tell me you got me
somethin' excitin'.

1:06:51.668 --> 1:06:53.602
Oh, I guess it's a little better

1:06:53.637 --> 1:06:55.538
than that possum call
the other day.

1:06:58.774 --> 1:07:03.777
small world, but would you
happen to have a relative

1:07:03.812 --> 1:07:06.252
workin' in the Philly PD?

1:07:07.387 --> 1:07:08.650
Wait. Wow.

1:07:09.185 --> 1:07:10.586
Yeah, my Uncle Jack.

1:07:10.621 --> 1:07:11.653
He just retired.

1:07:12.022 --> 1:07:13.556
You don't say?

1:07:13.791 --> 1:07:15.459
Yeah, in fact he's in town.

1:07:15.494 --> 1:07:16.691
He's visiting the family cabin.

1:07:16.726 --> 1:07:18.099
He's just tryin' to
get some rest.

1:07:18.334 --> 1:07:19.529
Why do you ask?

1:07:19.564 --> 1:07:22.565
Well, Pam, turns out
your Uncle Jack and I

1:07:22.600 --> 1:07:25.073
have a mutual
acquaintance in common

1:07:25.108 --> 1:07:28.340
and I would love to
chew his ear on some things.

1:07:28.875 --> 1:07:30.243
Well, that'd be great.

1:07:30.778 --> 1:07:32.740
Um, I'm sure he'd love to talk.

1:07:32.775 --> 1:07:36.348
His wife passed recently and
it's been really hard on him.

1:07:37.582 --> 1:07:39.648
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

1:07:40.585 --> 1:07:42.585
Well, could you be a sport

1:07:42.620 --> 1:07:45.093
and text me over
his cell phone number?

1:07:45.428 --> 1:07:48.294
Maybe I'll take him out for
a beer or somethin'.

1:07:49.495 --> 1:07:50.758
That'd be great.

1:07:50.793 --> 1:07:52.463
Perfect. Of course.

1:07:52.698 --> 1:07:54.663
Thanks, Pam.
You've been a great help.

1:07:54.998 --> 1:07:57.798
I'll let you know if I come
across any more possums.

1:07:57.833 --> 1:07:59.668
Okay, bye now.

1:08:47.586 --> 1:08:48.783
You got this.

1:08:54.824 --> 1:08:56.230
You reached Tom.

1:08:56.265 --> 1:08:57.528
I'm not about to pick up my--

1:08:58.729 --> 1:09:00.366
Pick up your goddamn phone,
Tommy!

1:09:08.574 --> 1:09:10.904
Tommy! Tommy!

1:09:12.776 --> 1:09:13.907
Tom!

1:09:19.849 --> 1:09:21.750
What the fuck?

1:09:23.886 --> 1:09:25.292
Tommy!

1:10:53.481 --> 1:10:54.678
Damn you two.

1:10:59.751 --> 1:11:01.487
You really fucked
this up for me.

1:11:22.906 --> 1:11:24.312
Yeah.
- Listen, Frank,

1:11:24.747 --> 1:11:26.908
I'm gonna need you to go pick up
Pam Harris, okay?

1:11:26.943 --> 1:11:28.514
You know she's off today.

1:11:28.549 --> 1:11:29.680
It doesn't matter.

1:11:30.949 --> 1:11:32.716
Tell her I wanna recommend her
for a promotion or somethin'.

1:11:32.751 --> 1:11:34.784
I just need her in our custody,
understand?

1:11:35.219 --> 1:11:37.358
And Frank,
don't tell her too much.

1:11:42.959 --> 1:11:44.497
Go on, get in.

1:12:03.947 --> 1:12:05.386
So, uh...

1:12:06.719 --> 1:12:08.554
how long you been
in dispatch now?

1:12:09.089 --> 1:12:11.920
A little over a year,
I guess, now.

1:12:13.594 --> 1:12:14.593
Why?

1:12:15.728 --> 1:12:17.728
Sounds like Hank's got
a plan for you.

1:12:20.799 --> 1:12:22.601
So, what's this all about?

1:12:23.103 --> 1:12:27.639
Seems like he wants to give you
some sort of leg up.

1:12:31.909 --> 1:12:33.909
Where was it you said we
were goin' again?

1:12:35.110 --> 1:12:37.616
Nowhere right now, anyway.

1:12:41.787 --> 1:12:42.786
Hank'll call soon.

1:12:44.889 --> 1:12:45.954
You just sit tight.

1:13:06.108 --> 1:13:07.074
Hi, Jack.

1:13:07.813 --> 1:13:09.142
With the girl?

1:13:09.177 --> 1:13:09.809
Who is this?

1:13:10.112 --> 1:13:12.585
Oh, my apologies.

1:13:12.787 --> 1:13:14.114
Let me introduce myself.

1:13:15.084 --> 1:13:16.083
Hank Rivers.

1:13:16.785 --> 1:13:19.625
Now, you mighta seen
my election signs

1:13:19.660 --> 1:13:20.824
on your way into town.

1:13:22.465 --> 1:13:25.532
Been kind of a interesting
day, wouldn't you say?

1:13:27.096 --> 1:13:28.667
I suppose it only makes sense

1:13:28.702 --> 1:13:30.933
you're a little bit tongue-tied
at the moment, Jack,

1:13:30.968 --> 1:13:33.133
so let's just get down to it.

1:13:34.169 --> 1:13:35.839
You and that girl you're helpin'

1:13:35.874 --> 1:13:37.610
killed two of my officers today.

1:13:38.910 --> 1:13:40.679
How did you get this number?

1:13:40.714 --> 1:13:42.142
Oh, we'll get to that, Jack.

1:13:42.811 --> 1:13:44.947
Right now I need you to
pay attention.

1:13:45.449 --> 1:13:47.785
Are you with the girl?

1:13:47.820 --> 1:13:48.819
No!

1:13:50.055 --> 1:13:51.019
Really?
Well, that's a damn shame.

1:13:52.154 --> 1:13:54.154
See, a lotta lives
were lost today.

1:13:55.124 --> 1:13:56.695
I'd hate for there to be more.

1:13:58.193 --> 1:13:59.797
Now, come on, Jack.

1:14:00.599 --> 1:14:03.900
Now, I'm sure you put
the pieces together by now.

1:14:05.002 --> 1:14:06.738
I found your badge.

1:14:07.540 --> 1:14:10.874
Now, back at the cabin,
can you imagine my surprise

1:14:10.909 --> 1:14:13.778
when I found out you and I
had a mutual friend?

1:14:14.583 --> 1:14:16.176
I mean, wow.

1:14:16.912 --> 1:14:19.949
Shit gets real tricky when
family's involved,

1:14:19.984 --> 1:14:20.983
doesn't it, Jack?

1:14:22.151 --> 1:14:25.218
Pam?
That lovely niece of yours?

1:14:27.222 --> 1:14:29.761
She's one hell of a dispatcher,
I'll give her that.

1:14:30.995 --> 1:14:32.863
You know what I like about
workin' with her?

1:14:33.536 --> 1:14:35.228
She's ambitious.

1:14:35.263 --> 1:14:41.003
Wants to get out in the field,
get some real action.

1:14:41.271 --> 1:14:44.842
Well, I reckon I may now
need to oblige her.

1:14:44.877 --> 1:14:46.173
Leave her outta this.

1:14:47.682 --> 1:14:49.176
Oh, I'd love to, Jack,

1:14:49.978 --> 1:14:54.115
but like I said,
she's hungry for some danger.

1:14:56.053 --> 1:14:57.184
What do you want?

1:14:58.319 --> 1:15:00.154
I swear, if you touch my niece.

1:15:00.990 --> 1:15:03.058
You just bring me the girl,

1:15:03.093 --> 1:15:04.598
and your niece stays safe.

1:15:05.568 --> 1:15:06.567
I give you my word.

1:15:07.328 --> 1:15:08.569
Come on, Jack.

1:15:11.167 --> 1:15:13.937
Haven't we both dealt with
enough loss lately?

1:15:16.238 --> 1:15:18.106
- You killed my brother, Jack.
-  What?

1:15:18.408 --> 1:15:19.613
I di--

1:15:20.209 --> 1:15:21.945
I didn't kill anyone.

1:15:22.614 --> 1:15:24.882
Well then,
I guess we both know who did,

1:15:24.917 --> 1:15:25.916
now don't we?

1:15:26.985 --> 1:15:29.216
Bring me the girl, Jack.

1:15:30.692 --> 1:15:31.988
No guns.

1:15:32.457 --> 1:15:35.629
Just a fair exchange of
the prisoner for your niece

1:15:35.664 --> 1:15:36.762
and we call it a day.

1:15:38.161 --> 1:15:39.699
Okay, okay, I'll do it.

1:15:40.268 --> 1:15:45.265
And Jack, you try anything
funny, anything foolish,

1:15:45.734 --> 1:15:48.268
both you and Pam will
disappear for good,

1:15:48.303 --> 1:15:50.237
I can promise you that.

1:15:50.272 --> 1:15:51.271
You understand?

1:15:54.012 --> 1:15:55.242
Yeah, copy that.

1:15:55.477 --> 1:15:56.716
Good.

1:15:57.151 --> 1:15:58.278
You have 10 minutes.

1:16:11.326 --> 1:16:12.699
Shannon.

1:16:18.707 --> 1:16:19.838
Shannon, wait.

1:16:26.979 --> 1:16:28.308
Shannon, wait.

1:16:37.385 --> 1:16:39.187
Wait, stop running.

1:17:12.829 --> 1:17:14.629
Open up. Please.

1:17:15.995 --> 1:17:16.961
Help me.

1:17:18.426 --> 1:17:19.700
I need your help.

1:17:20.102 --> 1:17:21.328
Open up the door, please.

1:17:21.363 --> 1:17:22.462
No, go away
or I'll call the police.

1:17:22.498 --> 1:17:24.067
- Please. Please, please.
- I will call the police!

1:17:24.102 --> 1:17:25.365
I need your help.

1:17:25.567 --> 1:17:27.235
Open the door. Please help me.

1:17:28.909 --> 1:17:29.974
Okay, hold on.

1:17:41.053 --> 1:17:42.283
Oh, God.
Take whatever you want--

1:17:42.318 --> 1:17:43.416
No, no, no.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:17:43.451 --> 1:17:44.758
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:17:44.793 --> 1:17:46.419
- I promise you.
- Please.

1:17:46.454 --> 1:17:47.695
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Stop.

1:17:47.730 --> 1:17:49.059
Where are the keys to your car?

1:17:49.094 --> 1:17:50.324
They're in my bedroom.
They're in the dresser drawer.

1:17:50.359 --> 1:17:51.699
We need to go.
We need to go now.

1:17:51.734 --> 1:17:52.865
- No.
- Now.

1:17:52.900 --> 1:17:53.966
- No.
- We gotta get outta here.

1:17:54.001 --> 1:17:56.066
Listen, there's a man that's
tryin' to get me killed.

1:17:56.101 --> 1:17:57.331
- Go.
- Okay, okay.

1:18:03.911 --> 1:18:05.680
Shannon.
- Fuck you, Jack.

1:18:06.309 --> 1:18:07.440
There's still a way.

1:18:17.386 --> 1:18:21.322
-

1:18:21.524 --> 1:18:22.697
Open the door.

1:18:24.459 --> 1:18:26.426
I'm not fucking around anymore,
Jack.

1:18:26.461 --> 1:18:27.867
I don't give a fuck
about your niece

1:18:28.069 --> 1:18:29.770
or any of your psycho
fucking cop friends.

1:18:30.038 --> 1:18:31.970
I've been through enough today,
do you understand me?

1:18:32.405 --> 1:18:35.138
I--I know, Shannon. Yes.

1:18:36.273 --> 1:18:37.811
I was never gonna bring you.

1:18:40.013 --> 1:18:43.883
I just needed a second to think.

1:18:44.518 --> 1:18:47.117
Can we just talk
again like before?

1:18:54.192 --> 1:18:55.323
Just listen to me.

1:18:55.992 --> 1:18:57.490
Just let me think for a minute.

1:18:59.230 --> 1:19:00.229
Talk.

1:19:00.664 --> 1:19:02.132
We're in this together.

1:19:03.366 --> 1:19:04.431
We're running outta time.

1:19:06.567 --> 1:19:09.205
I'm not hearing a plan, Jack.

1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:10.844
I am working on it.

1:19:12.111 --> 1:19:13.176
The third guy.

1:19:14.311 --> 1:19:16.311
He never saw you, right?

1:19:17.512 --> 1:19:18.445
No.

1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:21.052
He doesn't know
what you look like.

1:19:22.924 --> 1:19:24.517
He doesn't know
what you sound like.

1:19:26.158 --> 1:19:29.159
Get back. Please.

1:19:30.426 --> 1:19:31.898
Just stay.

1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:36.067
I'll put that woman on
the phone so he hears a voice.

1:19:37.565 --> 1:19:39.367
That will save my niece.

1:19:41.074 --> 1:19:42.370
What about my life?

1:19:43.005 --> 1:19:47.848
You've gotta get the video to
the FBI's office. Fast.

1:19:49.313 --> 1:19:50.510
What?

1:19:50.545 --> 1:19:51.346
It's our only chance.

1:19:53.988 --> 1:19:56.054
It's the only chance
we got right now.

1:20:04.592 --> 1:20:05.393
Okay.

1:20:30.255 --> 1:20:32.189
Don't worry,
I'll be back for you.

1:20:32.224 --> 1:20:33.960
We'll make this proper.

1:20:35.898 --> 1:20:36.897
Shit.

1:20:40.397 --> 1:20:42.166
- Well?
-  I've got her.

1:20:42.368 --> 1:20:45.840
We're at the cabin right off
Route 92 in Easton Lake.

1:20:46.042 --> 1:20:47.171
Put her on.

1:20:54.642 --> 1:20:56.543
This is Shannon Mathers.

1:20:56.878 --> 1:20:59.315
I was born 8-9-88.

1:20:59.617 --> 1:21:01.515
I am from Philadelphia.

1:21:01.950 --> 1:21:03.451
Well, thank you, honey.

1:21:03.486 --> 1:21:05.585
I'm gonna sort all this out,
okay?

1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:07.356
Don't you worry now.

1:21:08.227 --> 1:21:09.424
Please put Jack back on.

1:21:14.101 --> 1:21:16.068
Are we good?

1:21:16.103 --> 1:21:17.169
We'll see.

1:21:17.204 --> 1:21:19.467
Bring the girl back here and
we'll figure things out.

1:21:20.002 --> 1:21:21.601
I'm not goin' anywhere

1:21:21.636 --> 1:21:23.603
until I know my niece is safe.

1:21:23.638 --> 1:21:24.879
Jack, I'm...

1:21:27.708 --> 1:21:29.213
Here's what we're gonna do.

1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:32.150
Now, I'll make that happen,
Jack.

1:21:33.186 --> 1:21:34.251
But here's the thing.

1:21:34.987 --> 1:21:37.254
You're gonna stay on
the phone right now

1:21:37.289 --> 1:21:39.487
and I wanna hear the girl
countin' the whole time.

1:21:40.122 --> 1:21:41.522
What?

1:21:41.857 --> 1:21:44.327
Have her start at one and
keep goin' till I get there,

1:21:44.362 --> 1:21:45.933
however long it takes.

1:21:45.968 --> 1:21:47.902
I wanna hear that pretty
little voice countin'.

1:21:48.137 --> 1:21:49.332
Okay, okay.

1:21:54.174 --> 1:22:01.179
One, two, three, four.

1:22:07.055 --> 1:22:08.252
That good?

1:22:08.287 --> 1:22:09.385
Yeah, that's good,

1:22:10.621 --> 1:22:13.059
and there better not be any
disruptions or interruptions.

1:22:13.094 --> 1:22:14.390
You understand?

1:22:15.226 --> 1:22:20.330
Oh, and Jack, don't you dare
try any dumb shit

1:22:20.365 --> 1:22:21.661
or even think about runnin'.

1:22:21.696 --> 1:22:22.695
You get me?

1:22:24.171 --> 1:22:25.665
426,

1:22:27.669 --> 1:22:29.207
427,

1:22:30.738 --> 1:22:32.210
428,

1:22:33.642 --> 1:22:35.378
429...

1:22:37.481 --> 1:22:38.480
Come in, Hank.

1:22:39.681 --> 1:22:41.450
431...

1:22:42.585 --> 1:22:43.651
Go on.

1:22:43.686 --> 1:22:45.652
Yeah, I got a call here from
a young lady inquiring

1:22:45.687 --> 1:22:47.687
about filing a missing
persons report.

1:22:51.363 --> 1:22:52.362
Oh yeah?

1:22:53.465 --> 1:22:55.629
Yeah, she said that her friend,
a Shannon Mathers,

1:22:55.664 --> 1:22:58.269
is out hikin', shoulda called
her to pick her up by now.

1:22:58.304 --> 1:22:59.600
Wants to file a report.

1:23:00.235 --> 1:23:02.372
436...

1:23:05.245 --> 1:23:07.014
Well, you just call her back,

1:23:07.049 --> 1:23:08.510
tell her to come on in
to the office

1:23:08.545 --> 1:23:10.248
and stay put till I get back.

1:23:11.482 --> 1:23:12.778
You hear?

1:23:12.813 --> 1:23:15.088
Copy that.

1:23:45.153 --> 1:23:47.450
445...

1:23:51.126 --> 1:23:52.752
446,

1:23:55.823 --> 1:23:57.658
447...

1:24:00.729 --> 1:24:02.432
448...

1:24:05.701 --> 1:24:07.635
449...

1:24:38.767 --> 1:24:40.833
881,

1:24:41.836 --> 1:24:43.671
882.

1:24:45.774 --> 1:24:47.543
Okay, Jack,
that's enough for now.

1:24:48.178 --> 1:24:50.678
Tell her to stop.
I want you to look out front.

1:24:51.113 --> 1:24:52.317
Pam's right there.

1:24:52.752 --> 1:24:56.288
I'm gonna come in,
leavin' my weapon outside,

1:24:57.324 --> 1:25:00.358
and we're gonna do
the exchange like we agreed.

1:25:00.921 --> 1:25:02.129
Okay?

1:25:03.528 --> 1:25:04.659
Now, go on.

1:25:04.694 --> 1:25:05.825
Tell her to start countin'
again.

1:25:05.860 --> 1:25:10.665
- 900, 901, 902,
-

1:25:11.635 --> 1:25:18.541
903, 904, 905,

1:25:20.380 --> 1:25:26.780
- 906, 907, 908...
-

1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:34.887
909, 910, 911...

1:25:51.576 --> 1:25:52.608
Talk to me, Jack.

1:25:55.943 --> 1:25:57.712
Where in the fuck is she?

1:26:01.982 --> 1:26:03.256
Deal's off, Jack.

1:26:07.955 --> 1:26:10.824
Frank, the asset
is now expendable.

1:26:28.547 --> 1:26:31.911
Well, I shoulda figured.

1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:38.555
Shannon, I presume?

1:26:40.823 --> 1:26:43.692
Man, you have had
one hell of a day.

1:26:45.597 --> 1:26:47.927
Now we both know
you've done some things

1:26:47.962 --> 1:26:50.930
you probably shouldn't have,
but it's okay.

1:26:51.265 --> 1:26:52.470
I'm here to help ya.

1:26:54.001 --> 1:26:57.343
Frank, why the fuck am I not
hearing a goddamn gunshot?

1:26:58.212 --> 1:27:00.445
Frank's not
available at the moment.

1:27:00.480 --> 1:27:01.941
Can I help you with somethin',
Sheriff?

1:27:05.881 --> 1:27:07.518
Jack,
you listen to me, we had a--

1:27:07.553 --> 1:27:11.324
Actually, Hank,
I'd like you to listen.

1:27:11.854 --> 1:27:13.359
Listen to this.

1:27:16.331 --> 1:27:17.495
You hear that?

1:27:19.796 --> 1:27:21.895
That's the sound of justice.

1:27:23.998 --> 1:27:28.638
Um, do you wanna tell me
what on Earth is going on here?

1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:30.838
It's been a long day.

1:27:33.007 --> 1:27:35.678
You have to trust
your Uncle Jack.

1:27:37.913 --> 1:27:39.286
Copy that.

1:27:42.786 --> 1:27:44.918
-  431,

1:27:45.186 --> 1:27:49.296
432, 433...

1:27:54.061 --> 1:28:00.472
489, 490, 491...

1:28:01.706 --> 1:28:02.969
520.

1:28:04.544 --> 1:28:06.005
525.

1:28:06.674 --> 1:28:10.614
-

1:28:25.026 --> 1:28:26.630
You son of a...

1:28:30.372 --> 1:28:32.031
Abuse of power comes
as no surprise.

1:28:33.936 --> 1:28:34.902
I know men like you.

1:28:36.037 --> 1:28:38.345
You use people to get
what you want.

1:28:38.380 --> 1:28:40.512
All ego and no accountability.

1:28:41.047 --> 1:28:42.778
But I'm that bitch you
shouldn't have fucked with.

1:28:43.180 --> 1:28:45.550
Yeah?
Let's just see about that.

1:28:55.528 --> 1:28:58.959
-

1:29:06.837 --> 1:29:10.377
and bloodshot eyes

1:29:10.412 --> 1:29:12.973
a last goodbye

1:29:13.175 --> 1:29:16.911
clouded my mind

1:29:16.946 --> 1:29:19.980
the man's gotta die

1:29:22.919 --> 1:29:26.393
the tables turned

1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:35.468
on down the river

1:29:35.670 --> 1:29:38.966
a red-handed sinner

1:29:39.001 --> 1:29:44.037
can't cry out

1:29:44.439 --> 1:29:48.074
down the river

1:29:48.109 --> 1:29:51.649
a finger on the trigger

1:29:51.684 --> 1:29:57.050
to find me

1:29:59.122 --> 1:30:03.628
oh oh oh oh oh

1:30:05.027 --> 1:30:09.128
oh oh oh oh

1:30:11.572 --> 1:30:14.705
oh oh oh oh

1:30:14.740 --> 1:30:17.972
just take me on down

1:30:18.007 --> 1:30:22.108
oh oh oh oh

1:30:41.536 --> 1:30:43.668
There are still many
unanswered questions

1:30:43.703 --> 1:30:45.901
in a long-standing Internal
Affairs investigation

1:30:45.936 --> 1:30:49.102
in Green Shores County as
disgraced Sheriff Hank Rivers

1:30:49.137 --> 1:30:52.138
was found dead this morning
from an apparent suicide

1:30:52.173 --> 1:30:53.447
in his jail cell.

1:30:58.212 --> 1:31:00.014
Oh. Thank you.

1:31:01.149 --> 1:31:02.148
That's very nice.

1:31:03.085 --> 1:31:04.051
Ya know what, Pam?

1:31:04.757 --> 1:31:05.822
You were right.

1:31:06.291 --> 1:31:11.157
A little peace, quiet...
might not be so bad.

1:31:12.732 --> 1:31:14.864
Yeah, you know that whole
peace and quiet thing,

1:31:15.733 --> 1:31:17.867
I'm thinkin' that just might
not be in the cards

1:31:17.902 --> 1:31:18.901
for you, Uncle Jack.

1:31:21.235 --> 1:31:22.509
I'm glad you're here.

1:31:23.011 --> 1:31:24.005
Are you doin' good?

1:31:24.876 --> 1:31:25.875
I'm okay.

1:31:26.811 --> 1:31:29.241
All right, well, I better
go get changed.

1:31:29.276 --> 1:31:32.211
I, uh, got promoted to patrol.

1:31:32.246 --> 1:31:34.114
- Eh.
- It seems some spots opened up.

1:31:35.183 --> 1:31:36.952
You earned it, kiddo.

1:31:39.594 --> 1:31:41.726
-

1:31:43.257 --> 1:31:45.224
You expectin' someone,
Uncle Jack?

1:31:58.272 --> 1:31:59.271
You ready?

1:32:03.915 --> 1:32:05.079
How you been?

1:32:05.114 --> 1:32:06.619
Better than the last
time I saw you.

1:32:09.220 --> 1:32:11.217
You know, there's a whole
other side of this lake

1:32:11.252 --> 1:32:12.185
that I wanna show you.

1:32:13.188 --> 1:32:14.825
Wa--

1:32:15.194 --> 1:32:16.189
What's wrong?

1:32:17.258 --> 1:32:19.599
I left my gun. Let me go get it.

1:32:19.634 --> 1:32:22.965
It's okay.
Hey, I got us covered.

1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:23.999
I got this.

1:32:24.804 --> 1:32:26.067
You know what, Shannon,

1:32:28.170 --> 1:32:30.643
your dad would be
pretty damn proud.

1:32:33.043 --> 1:32:34.108
Now let's go,

1:32:36.750 --> 1:32:38.684
and we'll finish what
you started.

1:32:40.347 --> 1:32:42.149
Go say goodbye to him.

1:32:42.987 --> 1:32:44.217
Okay.

1:32:50.357 --> 1:32:54.194
a wanted man

1:32:58.640 --> 1:33:03.742
cold steel bars

1:33:13.021 --> 1:33:17.657
break this bus down

1:33:18.026 --> 1:33:25.027
that I know will never end

1:33:30.331 --> 1:33:34.366
you forever

1:33:34.401 --> 1:33:38.909
criminal dreams

1:33:48.316 --> 1:33:53.220
close together

1:33:53.255 --> 1:33:57.323
criminal dreams

1:34:07.035 --> 1:34:11.007
to pleasure

1:34:11.442 --> 1:34:15.814
criminal dreams

1:34:29.324 --> 1:34:34.030
criminal dreams

1:34:44.705 --> 1:34:48.341
across your face

1:34:48.376 --> 1:34:52.950
my dirty cell

1:34:52.985 --> 1:34:57.053
wounded cries

1:34:58.419 --> 1:35:02.256
I think of you

1:35:02.458 --> 1:35:06.766
rendezvous

1:35:07.635 --> 1:35:14.840
everything that's true

1:35:20.073 --> 1:35:24.476
you forever

1:35:24.511 --> 1:35:29.052
criminal dreams
