00:01.257 --> 00:03.891
Why would the President
want to kill your wife?

00:03.893 --> 00:06.026
Her very existence
is a threat to him.

00:06.028 --> 00:09.964
So, you're telling me, he's so afraid of
a scandal that he would commit murder.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.065
Yes.

00:12.167 --> 00:14.201
This is crazy.

00:14.203 --> 00:17.738
And, assassinating him, how does that
even help you get his bone marrow?

00:17.740 --> 00:19.573
It was the only way
to get near him.

00:19.575 --> 00:24.811
I needed allies, resources, people inside
the White House to help arrange all this.

00:24.813 --> 00:26.646
So, we went to Kincaid's enemies.

00:26.648 --> 00:31.051
They were willing to assist, on the
condition that we guaranteed his death.

00:31.053 --> 00:35.889
And, what about your team?
Archer, Sandrine...

00:35.891 --> 00:37.824
They're what, hired guns?

00:37.826 --> 00:39.225
Do they know all this?

00:41.662 --> 00:43.162
So you lie to them, too.

00:43.164 --> 00:44.898
I told them what
they need to know.

00:44.900 --> 00:48.902
And I suggest you do the same with
your family, especially Brian.

00:48.904 --> 00:51.137
Do you trust how he'll react?

00:51.139 --> 00:53.439
You are out of your mind.

00:53.441 --> 00:56.342
Innocent people are
dead because of you.

00:56.344 --> 00:59.512
I didn't want it to happen
this way, but I'm in too deep.

01:02.516 --> 01:07.053
If I back out now,
they'll get rid of me.

01:07.055 --> 01:10.122
And anybody else who's involved.

01:10.124 --> 01:11.289
My family.

01:12.959 --> 01:14.326
And your family.

01:14.328 --> 01:16.729
You're an FBI agent,
you can make a deal.

01:16.731 --> 01:19.565
Go to the police, the prosecutors,
there's a way out of this.

01:19.567 --> 01:20.699
There isn't.

01:21.801 --> 01:24.036
I can't stop this thing.

01:24.038 --> 01:25.370
And neither can you.

01:27.507 --> 01:29.207
Well, I don't accept that.

01:29.209 --> 01:30.842
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

01:33.579 --> 01:35.580
What if I go to the President?

01:35.582 --> 01:40.118
I'm meeting with his Chief of Staff
tomorrow, I could tell him what's going on.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.953
I don't think so.

01:41.955 --> 01:46.724
The Chief of Staff just died
of a heart attack an hour ago.

01:46.726 --> 01:50.327
(DOOR SLAMMING) The Chief of Staff,
and now Hoffman's dead, too?

01:50.329 --> 01:51.930
Just saw it on the news.

01:51.932 --> 01:55.033
Police believe he was the victim
of an attempted carjacking.

01:55.035 --> 01:58.602
Hoffman I can understand.
He was getting too close to the truth.

01:58.604 --> 02:00.737
But Creasy?
Why'd they take him out?

02:00.739 --> 02:02.440
Creasy was never the boss.

02:02.442 --> 02:05.008
Maybe the people up
the chain got cold feet.

02:05.010 --> 02:07.878
Decided to shut down the operation.
Eliminate loose ends.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.645
If that's true,
why aren't we dead?

02:11.149 --> 02:12.816
The night's still young.

02:12.818 --> 02:15.485
BRIAN: Hoffman's murder
wasn't a coincidence.

02:15.487 --> 02:17.921
I just spoke to the guy,
he knew what was going on.

02:17.923 --> 02:20.624
Duncan and his friends are
nervous and they took him out.

02:20.626 --> 02:22.059
It's possible.

02:22.061 --> 02:24.360
(SCOFFING)
"It's possible"?

02:24.362 --> 02:27.631
Well, I don't think they would
murder a federal agent.

02:27.633 --> 02:28.800
What are you talking about?

02:28.869 --> 02:31.405
They just gunned down
a teenager in our house.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.503
They'll do anything to
get rid of the President.

02:33.505 --> 02:35.732
I have a feeling it's more
complicated than that.

02:35.805 --> 02:37.424
Why?

02:37.508 --> 02:39.709
I just do.

02:39.711 --> 02:41.744
I don't think they're terrorists.

02:41.746 --> 02:44.214
I think there's
something else going on.

02:44.216 --> 02:45.498
This leaves us in a bad spot.

02:45.576 --> 02:47.308
We don't know
who we're dealing with anymore.

02:47.319 --> 02:49.251
Logan's our only partner now.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.621
Partner? I'm not so sure.

02:51.623 --> 02:55.257
I don't like the fact that he didn't
give us a heads up about Hoffman.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.959
Or Creasy.

02:56.961 --> 03:00.129
- It's not a good sign.
- I'm meeting him tomorrow.

03:00.131 --> 03:02.898
- I'll get some answers then.
- Just watch your step.

03:05.201 --> 03:07.869
- Ellen figured it out.
- Excuse me?

03:07.871 --> 03:09.704
Nina.

03:09.706 --> 03:13.808
Her relationship to the President.
The bone marrow.

03:13.810 --> 03:17.379
The more people who know,
the more complicated this becomes.

03:17.381 --> 03:18.547
She's smart.

03:19.749 --> 03:22.216
- She understands that.
- I know she's smart.

03:22.218 --> 03:24.886
But will she keep her mouth shut?

03:24.888 --> 03:27.421
BRIAN: Do you know something
that you're not telling me?

03:27.423 --> 03:30.525
- Like what?
- I don't know. That's why I'm asking.

03:31.927 --> 03:33.995
Do you know why
Duncan is doing this?

03:35.097 --> 03:38.299
No. I have no idea.

03:46.775 --> 03:49.243
MRS. KINCAID:
One of my assistant's was there.

03:49.245 --> 03:52.213
She saw it with her own eyes,
said it was horrible.

03:53.315 --> 03:56.717
Gasping and convulsing...

03:56.719 --> 03:59.586
I can't even think about his
poor wife and their little girl.

04:00.689 --> 04:02.022
It's tragic.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.757
Yeah.

04:03.759 --> 04:06.660
I never cared for Quentin, but...

04:06.662 --> 04:09.731
but any time a young man dies
in the prime of his life...

04:09.770 --> 04:12.128
Like Peter?

04:12.567 --> 04:14.734
Sort of.

04:14.736 --> 04:16.803
What do you mean, "Sort of"?

04:16.805 --> 04:20.940
The truth is, Peter was partially
responsible for his own death.

04:20.942 --> 04:24.211
You think it was Peter's
fault that his plane crashed?

04:24.213 --> 04:27.479
It was his fault that he thought he
was invincible and could fly a plane

04:27.481 --> 04:31.184
over the Rockies, at night, after
20 straight hours of campaigning.

04:31.186 --> 04:34.921
Don't look at me like that.
I loved him as much as you did.

04:34.923 --> 04:37.423
For God's sake,
I practically raised him.

04:37.425 --> 04:40.927
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't
be honest about what happened.

04:40.929 --> 04:42.561
I agree.

04:42.563 --> 04:46.232
The way that my sister compartmentalizes,
and rationalizes, it's...

04:46.234 --> 04:51.203
It's infuriating.
"Peter was too brash, so, he died."

04:51.205 --> 04:53.405
There you go.
As simple as that.

04:53.407 --> 04:55.541
Well, she didn't
want to face the truth.

04:55.543 --> 04:59.111
It's just, I wanted to say to her,
God, I wanted to tell her so badly,

04:59.113 --> 05:02.347
the reason Peter died is because
your husband had him killed.

05:02.349 --> 05:04.616
Well, I'm glad you
restrained yourself.

05:06.452 --> 05:07.986
Here.

05:07.988 --> 05:09.554
It wasn't easy, I swear.

05:11.958 --> 05:13.859
Don't worry.

05:13.861 --> 05:15.593
He'll pay for what he did.

05:17.596 --> 05:19.230
He better.

05:19.232 --> 05:22.333
- Are you losing faith?
- I'm losing patience.

05:22.335 --> 05:24.168
And confidence.

05:24.170 --> 05:27.338
I still have no idea if this
doctor is going to come through

05:27.340 --> 05:30.107
or if the FBI agent
is doing his job.

05:30.109 --> 05:31.842

05:31.844 --> 05:34.444

LOGAN: Yeah. Sad.
Another random act of violence.

I thought we were going to
take care of that together.

06:04.435 --> 06:06.835
Clock was ticking.
Had to take care of it myself.

06:06.837 --> 06:08.471

- No, not yet.

You have me.

06:24.988 --> 06:28.655
My deal was with Creasy.
Not you.

06:28.693 --> 06:32.560
So, with all due respect, I need to know
my side of this is being taken care of.

06:33.262 --> 06:36.131
If they want to reach
out to you, they will.

06:36.133 --> 06:37.332

Oh, one more thing.

06:42.705 --> 06:45.840
The five minute window you
requested in the operating room?

06:45.842 --> 06:47.094
What about it?

06:47.165 --> 06:48.893
It's getting harder
to make those arrangements.

06:48.928 --> 06:50.277
That's non-negotiable.

06:51.213 --> 06:53.014
Why do you need all that time?

06:53.016 --> 06:57.083
We made a deal. I expect you
and your partners to honor it.

06:58.887 --> 07:00.154
I'll let them know.

07:10.565 --> 07:14.501
- I just talked to our friend at the FBI.
- And?

07:42.864 --> 07:44.397
So how do we get access?

07:44.399 --> 07:45.798
We need a warrant.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.933
A warrant? What are you talking
about, like going to a judge?

07:47.935 --> 07:49.569
Who said anything about a judge?

07:49.571 --> 07:52.271
I said we need a warrant, I
didn't say it needed to be real.

07:52.273 --> 07:56.041
The President seems
to be a reasonable man.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.043
Did you even try to
approach him directly?

07:58.045 --> 07:59.812
I told you, that's not an option.

07:59.814 --> 08:01.413
But how could you be so sure?

08:01.415 --> 08:04.516
So, he had an illegitimate child.
That was over 30 years ago.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.284
Kincaid raped Nina's mother.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.319
What?

08:10.190 --> 08:13.726
Kincaid was a young congressman
at the time.

08:13.728 --> 08:16.328
Nina's mother was a young journalist.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.930
She went to his hotel room.
For an interview.

08:22.034 --> 08:24.636
And he raped her.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.706
A few weeks later, she threatened
to go public with her story.

08:29.709 --> 08:32.711
Kincaid tried to buy her silence.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.846
How could you possibly
know all this?

08:34.847 --> 08:38.549
Burton Delaney was one of
Kincaid's closest advisors.

08:38.551 --> 08:40.284
He told me what happened next.

08:40.285 --> 08:43.621
I didn't force myself on her, Burton.
Now, you believe me, right?

08:43.623 --> 08:46.057
It's not about what I believe.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.825
It's about your reputation.

08:47.827 --> 08:49.961
BURTON:
Your political future.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.895
You're on the cusp right now, Paul.

08:51.897 --> 08:54.665
This accusation could
derail your entire career.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.800
I gave you the money
to pay her off.

08:56.802 --> 08:58.201
She wouldn't take it.

08:58.203 --> 09:01.772
Double the offer.
Everyone has a price.

09:01.774 --> 09:03.206
Not this one.

09:04.976 --> 09:06.910
We need to take
a different approach.

09:06.912 --> 09:08.945
Well, what exactly are you saying?

09:08.947 --> 09:12.415
I'm saying this is a problem
that won't go away on its own.

09:12.417 --> 09:17.854
If you can't buy silence, you have to
eliminate the source of the noise.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.470
The woman's name was Kate Renner.

09:25.962 --> 09:27.263
Burton knew her.

09:28.899 --> 09:31.434
He couldn't go
through with it, so...

09:31.436 --> 09:33.536
he helped her get out
of the country.

09:33.538 --> 09:36.939
A few months later, he found out she
was pregnant with Kincaid's child.

09:36.941 --> 09:39.141
- Where is she now?
- She died in childbirth.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.777
- Oh...
- Burton adopted the girl.

09:41.779 --> 09:44.113
Nina. Raised her.

09:44.115 --> 09:47.382
He never told her or
anybody else the truth.

09:47.384 --> 09:49.852
The only reason
he told me is because...

09:55.125 --> 09:56.591
because Nina got sick.

09:59.529 --> 10:02.130
So, now do you understand?

10:02.132 --> 10:05.434
Kincaid is not a reasonable man.

pocket when he climbed in the window.

I heard it ring, I swear.

What if Boyd's dad goes to the police?
What are we gonna do?

11:22.075 --> 11:23.943
Maybe there's a medical solution.

11:23.945 --> 11:27.213
If there were a medical solution, do you
really think I'd be going through all this?

11:27.215 --> 11:30.649
Let me review Nina's files, maybe
I'll come up with something that...

11:30.651 --> 11:33.685
I've talked to the best
oncologists in the world, Ellen.

11:33.687 --> 11:36.187

on the operating table,

11:44.264 --> 11:48.033
I can't be wondering if Nina could
have been saved some other way.

11:48.035 --> 11:49.802
You're right.

You'll come to the
same conclusion I did.

12:00.346 --> 12:03.114
I'll send over Nina's medical records
to your office today.

12:12.591 --> 12:14.158
(DOOR OPENING)

12:14.160 --> 12:15.735
Mr. President.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.264
I'm afraid he was needed
in another meeting.

12:18.464 --> 12:21.298
Ted Jankowski.
Acting Chief of Staff.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.468
It's nice to finally meet you.

12:23.470 --> 12:26.470
- Something I can help you with?
- Uh, yes, there might be.

12:26.472 --> 12:28.705
First of all,
my condolences on Quentin.

12:28.707 --> 12:31.175
I met him a few times.
Great loss.

12:31.177 --> 12:32.776
I need to speak with the President.

12:32.778 --> 12:35.112
He and I were supposed to discuss
a major policy initiative.

12:35.114 --> 12:37.481
- What initiative?
- I'm afraid it's classified.

12:37.483 --> 12:40.084
I'm sorry, but the President's
schedule is fully booked.

12:40.086 --> 12:41.885
We can set something
up for next week.

12:41.887 --> 12:44.220
Uh, this matter is time sensitive.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.990
Any chance I can get even a brief
meeting on schedule sooner than that?

12:46.992 --> 12:48.725
Sorry, it's a busy week.

13:34.237 --> 13:36.638
- Ellen?
- I found something in your wife's files.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.874
1,249 people were tested,
not one of them was a match.

13:39.876 --> 13:42.644
But there was one anonymous
donor who came close.

13:42.646 --> 13:43.878
How close?

13:43.880 --> 13:45.247
28%.

13:45.249 --> 13:47.349
So? That's not enough
for a viable transplant.

13:47.351 --> 13:50.351
I know, but this person could be a
relative, maybe even a sibling.

13:50.353 --> 13:52.754
What I'm saying is, this person
could lead us to a better match.

13:52.756 --> 13:55.356
If there were a better
match, we'd already know.

13:55.358 --> 13:57.158
I'm trying to save your wife.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.930
What do you need?

14:01.932 --> 14:04.032
Uh, name and address.

14:04.034 --> 14:05.866
Give me the donor number.

14:05.868 --> 14:09.002
With Creasy gone,
I've got no damn access.

14:09.004 --> 14:11.905
You still think Kincaid will go
public with OTI before the surgery?

14:11.907 --> 14:13.541
Possibly.

14:13.543 --> 14:15.876
- I don't know.
- Why roll the dice?

14:15.878 --> 14:19.346
- What are you saying?
- OTI is important.

14:19.348 --> 14:22.415
Don't give this bastard a chance
to take that away from you.

14:24.018 --> 14:29.121
Do we really want to bet the future
of this country on Dr. Sanders?

14:29.757 --> 14:31.558
Or Duncan Carlisle?

14:31.560 --> 14:33.359
They tried and failed.

14:35.063 --> 14:38.264
Why should we believe they'll
pull it off this time, hmm?

14:38.266 --> 14:41.367
Fair enough, but what
other options do we have?

14:41.369 --> 14:44.236
It's not that easy
to kill the President.

14:57.652 --> 14:59.714
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

14:59.890 --> 15:01.108
What did you find?

15:01.195 --> 15:03.582
The name of your mystery donor
is Sally Whitaker.

15:03.591 --> 15:05.358
I'm texting you her address now.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.660
Okay, perfect.
I'll let you know what I come up with.

Can I help you?

15:49.136 --> 15:50.669
I'm looking for Sally Whitaker.
Is she in?

15:50.671 --> 15:52.336
I'm afraid she's not.

15:52.338 --> 15:55.807
(SIGHING) Do you know when she'll be back?
I really need to speak with her.

15:55.809 --> 15:57.475
What for?

15:57.477 --> 15:59.878
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm with the Reston Blood Bank.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.447
I tried calling a few times,
but I couldn't get through.

16:02.449 --> 16:05.050
Um, it's about a recent
donation Sally made.

16:05.052 --> 16:07.018
I have the paperwork here
somewhere.

16:08.587 --> 16:11.255
Do you mind if I come in
for a moment?

16:11.257 --> 16:12.990
Okay.

16:12.992 --> 16:16.160
But, uh, you must have
some kind of a mix-up.

16:16.162 --> 16:20.398
(CHUCKLING) Sally never mentioned
anything about giving blood.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.834
Are you sure? Our records
indicate she did make a donation.

16:23.836 --> 16:27.837
It was earmarked for a very
sick patient, Nina Carlisle?

16:28.339 --> 16:29.506
Never heard of her.

16:37.916 --> 16:38.916

Miss?

16:40.151 --> 16:41.551
Are you all right?

16:41.553 --> 16:44.554
Sorry, I just,
uh, that photo there...

16:46.023 --> 16:48.024
It just looks like someone I know.

Yeah, they're, uh, friends of my wife.
(CHUCKLING)

17:00.738 --> 17:03.506
Okay, well, I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

17:03.508 --> 17:06.275
Uh, can I just trouble
you for a glass of water?

17:06.277 --> 17:10.046
I've been driving in the car all day,
I just... (CLEARING THROAT)

17:10.048 --> 17:11.079
Sure.

17:25.462 --> 17:28.564
Thank you.

17:28.566 --> 17:30.885
I understand the President's
going to New York tomorrow.

17:30.918 --> 17:33.702
- Do you have his full itinerary?
- LOGAN: They just issued it to us.

17:33.771 --> 17:35.403
I'm talking about his
unofficial itinerary.

17:35.405 --> 17:37.405
The one that includes his
off-the-record meetings.

17:37.407 --> 17:38.540
I will.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.709
I'm on his detail tomorrow.

17:40.711 --> 17:43.411
He'll have at least one
off-the-record meeting tomorrow.

I want exact details. Time and place.
Operational security.

17:46.683 --> 17:47.915
Everything.

17:47.917 --> 17:49.016
Copy that.

17:49.018 --> 17:51.486
Logan, one more thing.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.954
I'm gonna need you to get
in touch with somebody.

18:10.706 --> 18:14.008
WOMAN: Hey, sweetie. I'm with customers,
can I call you right back?

18:14.010 --> 18:15.642
Sorry, my name's Ellen.

18:15.644 --> 18:18.879
I found this phone in the street and
just called the last number dialed.

18:18.881 --> 18:21.515
Oh, thanks so much,
it belongs to my husband.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.783
Well, I just want to
return it to the owner.

18:23.785 --> 18:27.321
That's so nice of you.
I can come get it wherever is convenient.

18:27.323 --> 18:30.424
Uh, well, I'm driving
right now, where are you?

18:30.426 --> 18:34.695
Uh, North Arlington.
Near Wilson Boulevard and 20th.

18:34.697 --> 18:38.031
Well, I can drop it
over to you if you like.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.595
I have to head over there
in about a half hour, anyway.

18:40.599 --> 18:45.205
Really? You're an angel.
I'm in the antique store on the corner.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.339
See you soon.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)
MAN: Yeah?

18:51.379 --> 18:54.714
- Raven gave me your number.
- Okay, I'm listening.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.430
I'd like to meet in person.

18:56.435 --> 18:59.662
- It's about a job opportunity.
- Where's the party?

18:59.687 --> 19:01.687
I can tell you
everything in person.

19:01.689 --> 19:06.191
But Raven said to let you know that it'd be
a platinum level gig, platinum level pay.

19:06.193 --> 19:07.560
Sounds good.

19:07.562 --> 19:09.895
Meet me in 30 minutes
at Mitchell Park.

- LOGAN: Southwest corner, I'll find you.
- MAN: See you there.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.401
What, did you use a fake warrant?

19:16.403 --> 19:20.239
Warrant was real. Signature was fake.
Nobody ever looks.

19:20.241 --> 19:22.875
- So, what's this phone call about?
- I don't know.

19:22.877 --> 19:25.043
You think it's
anything to do with us?

19:25.045 --> 19:28.880
In the past 24 hours, a Secret Service
agent and the Chief of Staff were killed.

19:28.882 --> 19:31.849
The fact that Logan's reaching
out to some sort of operative?

19:31.851 --> 19:33.251
It's not good.

19:51.236 --> 19:54.138
Hi. I called you about
your husband's phone.

19:54.140 --> 19:59.542
Oh, hello. I'm just finishing up some
paperwork, why don't you come on back?

20:19.097 --> 20:21.965
Put the gun down. Please.

Who are you?

I'm a doctor.

20:26.171 --> 20:27.457
My husband called me.

20:27.472 --> 20:30.595
I know you came to the house.
You stole his phone.

20:30.630 --> 20:31.841
What do you want?

20:33.109 --> 20:36.311
I know you're related
to Nina Carlisle.

20:36.313 --> 20:39.714
You two are a 28% match
for bone marrow type.

20:39.716 --> 20:43.118
Trust me, you don't want
to get involved in this.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.287
I saw the wedding photo
in your hall.

20:45.289 --> 20:49.924
If you knew what was good for you,
you'd leave and never come back.

20:49.926 --> 20:51.259
Well, I can't do that.

20:53.829 --> 20:55.129
I know who you are.

20:56.599 --> 20:58.700
You're Kate Renner.

20:58.702 --> 21:00.468
Nina's mother.

21:11.085 --> 21:14.086
I haven't heard that name
in many years.

21:15.123 --> 21:16.590
Why are you here?

21:18.759 --> 21:21.161
Burton Delaney.

21:21.163 --> 21:24.531
He told me your story, I'm sorry.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.398
It was a lifetime ago.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.533
I've moved on.

21:29.036 --> 21:30.903
I thought you were dead.

21:30.905 --> 21:32.171
That was the idea.

21:34.008 --> 21:35.875
Must have been hard.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.243
Giving up your child.

21:39.513 --> 21:40.680
What do you want?

21:42.282 --> 21:44.382
Your daughter is sick.

21:45.752 --> 21:47.652
She has leukemia.

21:48.221 --> 21:50.656
She needs a donor.

21:50.658 --> 21:53.892
You're not a close enough match, but I
was hoping you could lead me to one.

21:53.894 --> 21:57.095
If Nina has one other blood
relative, there's a chance.

21:58.898 --> 22:01.733
Did you ever have
any other children?

22:01.735 --> 22:02.901
No.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.309
I see.

22:13.412 --> 22:17.248
Well, I'm sorry to
have disturbed you.

22:22.555 --> 22:24.989
Why is Nina's life
so important to you?

22:26.958 --> 22:28.426
Because...

22:30.762 --> 22:32.462
I have a family too.

Oh, well...

No, I haven't.
Everything okay?

Not exactly.

23:12.002 --> 23:13.870
I'm afraid, Boyd, uh...

23:13.872 --> 23:18.240
Well, he broke up with your daughter
in a rather cowardly manner.

Oh. Um, okay.

I'd like to talk to Morgan,
in person.

I feel I owe it to her.

23:38.228 --> 23:40.261
Okay. Sure.

Morgan!

23:43.234 --> 23:44.266
Morgan?

This is Mr. Norton.

Boyd's dad.

23:53.942 --> 23:55.510
We've met.

Hello, Mr. Norton.

23:56.713 --> 23:58.045
Hi, Morgan.

23:58.047 --> 24:00.181
Nice to see you, I...

24:00.183 --> 24:04.085
wish it were under
different circumstances.

24:04.087 --> 24:07.889
I felt I needed to come over and
apologize to you on my son's behalf.

24:07.891 --> 24:10.357
That's so sweet of you,
but you didn't have to do that.

24:12.261 --> 24:13.761
I'm fine.

24:13.763 --> 24:17.131
Really, I'm okay.

24:17.133 --> 24:19.200
Um, I'm confused.

I'm sorry, Mr. Sanders,
I thought you knew.

Look, I heard from Boyd
about an hour ago.

24:27.743 --> 24:29.242
He told me everything.

This is no ordinary target.

I'll reach out to you later
today with more details.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.340
Come to think of it,
I do have one question.

Why?

25:03.211 --> 25:04.444
(CAMERA CLICKING)

25:07.481 --> 25:11.317
It's okay, Mr. Norton.
My parents know that I got pregnant.

25:11.319 --> 25:14.186
Boyd shouldn't have run out
on his responsibilities.

I mean, now is not the time to ship out
on a fishing boat for three months.

about that for a long time.

I know.

the work's gonna be.

Well, I don't blame him...

and I certainly don't blame you.

I appreciate that, Morgan.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.180
Really, I do.

25:42.182 --> 25:46.150
But you know,
it's not really Boyd's fault.

25:46.152 --> 25:47.686
The truth is,

25:49.121 --> 25:52.016
I should have set a better example.

25:52.624 --> 25:55.026
I wasn't around enough
when he was growing up.

25:58.764 --> 26:00.965
It was nice to see you again,
Morgan.

Guess my son has a lot
of growing up to do.

26:12.511 --> 26:15.707
I need your help.
Take a look at this photo.

26:16.981 --> 26:18.682
SANDRINE:
Who are they?

26:18.684 --> 26:20.787
The guy on the right is our contact
inside the Secret Service.

26:20.863 --> 26:22.168
His name's Logan.

26:22.203 --> 26:24.187
He met up with that other guy
about a half an hour ago.

26:24.189 --> 26:26.189
Duncan wants to know who he is.

26:26.191 --> 26:30.259
I'll run it through facial recognition.
See if we get a hit.

26:37.501 --> 26:38.768
Are you okay?

26:39.837 --> 26:41.037
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:46.043 --> 26:47.644
What happened with Sally Whitaker?

26:51.381 --> 26:53.215
She's Nina's mother.

26:53.217 --> 26:54.517
What?

26:54.519 --> 26:56.885
Sally Whitaker's real name
is Kate Renner.

26:56.887 --> 26:58.254
Are you positive?

26:58.256 --> 27:00.356
Yes, I...

27:00.358 --> 27:02.257
I saw a picture of you and Nina.

27:02.259 --> 27:04.059
In her house.

27:04.061 --> 27:05.861
And I confronted her and...

27:05.863 --> 27:08.997
she confirmed everything
you said about Kincaid.

27:08.999 --> 27:11.733
She's been living under an assumed
identity all these years.

27:14.671 --> 27:16.137
DUNCAN:
Why didn't you tell me?

27:16.139 --> 27:18.473
What good would it have
done for me to tell you?

27:18.475 --> 27:21.209
You don't think Nina would have
wanted to know her mother was alive?

27:21.211 --> 27:25.113
Of course she would have.
That's why I had to lie.

27:25.115 --> 27:28.416
You think I wanted to keep this secret?
I did it to protect everybody.

27:28.418 --> 27:31.151
Nina, Kate, Sawyer.

27:32.088 --> 27:34.455
- You could have told me.
- I could have.

27:34.457 --> 27:36.056
But then what?

27:36.058 --> 27:39.927
You'd be forced to lie to your wife
every day for the rest of your life.

27:39.929 --> 27:42.997
I carried that burden with
me since she was born.

27:42.999 --> 27:44.765
Trust me.

27:44.767 --> 27:47.133
I did you a favor, Duncan.

27:49.337 --> 27:51.738
You know I always thought
of you like a son.

27:51.740 --> 27:52.973
I know you have.

27:54.675 --> 27:57.378
So I'm gonna ask you one time.

27:57.380 --> 28:00.614
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?

28:00.616 --> 28:03.484
- Excuse me?
- I don't want any more surprises.

28:03.486 --> 28:05.885
I've told you everything.

28:13.628 --> 28:14.961
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

28:22.236 --> 28:23.802
Duncan, it's me.

28:23.804 --> 28:25.738
What is it?

28:25.740 --> 28:28.607
Kramer took a photo of a guy talking
to the Secret Service agent.

28:28.609 --> 28:30.209
You got a name?

28:30.211 --> 28:33.679
Robert Harper.
Former Army Ranger and decorated sniper.

28:35.349 --> 28:36.949
Sniper?

28:36.951 --> 28:38.918
Four tours of duty in Iraq.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.986
Over 100 confirmed kills.

28:48.028 --> 28:49.528
Duncan.

28:49.530 --> 28:50.696
What is it?

28:54.067 --> 28:57.301
The guy Logan was
talking to in the park.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.072
He's a sniper.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.409
They want to take me out.

29:14.548 --> 29:16.110
They did the math and decided

29:16.145 --> 29:18.766
that it was just too risky
to continue the operation.

29:18.768 --> 29:21.769
- Creasy, Hoffman.
- Now me.

29:22.905 --> 29:25.273
They're mopping up.

29:25.275 --> 29:28.576
- You should get out of the country.
- No.

29:28.578 --> 29:32.078
- We've come too far.
- So, what do you propose?

29:36.085 --> 29:38.185
Shoot the sniper
before he shoots me.

29:40.589 --> 29:41.756
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

29:44.759 --> 29:47.961
What the hell just happened
back there with Boyd's father?

29:49.931 --> 29:51.865
I found Boyd's phone.

29:51.867 --> 29:54.034
And his Dad kept calling,

29:54.036 --> 29:56.403
so Sandrine and I texted him back.

29:56.405 --> 30:00.807
We made up a cover story, so that
Mr. Norton wouldn't go to the cops.

30:00.809 --> 30:02.743
- (SCOFFING)
- What?

30:02.745 --> 30:05.746
I can't believe you.
When were you going to tell me this?

30:05.748 --> 30:07.681
We didn't know he
was going to come over.

30:07.683 --> 30:11.251
"We"? Hey. We're not
on the same side, Morgan.

30:11.253 --> 30:13.853
We have to cooperate with them.

30:17.124 --> 30:18.958
- Besides...
- Besides what?

30:21.895 --> 30:23.963
They didn't mean to kill Boyd.

30:25.132 --> 30:28.034
It just... happened.

30:28.036 --> 30:31.404
Oh, for God sakes.
Morgan, listen.

30:31.406 --> 30:34.073
These people
are holding us hostage.

30:35.142 --> 30:37.710
They're evil.
You see that, don't you?

30:45.118 --> 30:46.118
(SIGHING)

30:49.255 --> 30:52.791
- How are you feeling?
- Optimistic.

30:52.793 --> 30:55.294
Now, frankly, I never liked
the idea of sitting back and

30:55.296 --> 30:58.162
relying on somebody else.
I'm a Marine at heart.

30:58.698 --> 31:02.401
- Only happy in the mud.
- But you clean up so well.

31:02.403 --> 31:04.936
You can't have dirt on your
shoes in the oval office?

31:06.505 --> 31:09.174
That is why I have you
to keep me civilized.

31:09.176 --> 31:10.909
Not too civilized.

31:18.951 --> 31:21.219
What about that FBI agent?

31:21.221 --> 31:22.886
Carlisle.

31:22.888 --> 31:25.323
- I'm handling it.
- Good.

31:38.103 --> 31:40.037
Hey, uh...

31:40.039 --> 31:42.106
I'm worried about Morgan.

31:42.108 --> 31:44.274
She's starting
to believe these guys.

31:44.276 --> 31:45.508
What do you mean?

31:46.644 --> 31:49.312
She helped them cover up
Boyd's death.

31:49.314 --> 31:50.914
It's like she's...

31:50.916 --> 31:52.549
part of their team.

31:52.551 --> 31:53.886
She told me what happened.

31:53.925 --> 31:56.641
I don't understand
why you're so upset with her.

31:57.121 --> 31:59.188
What do you mean
you don't know why?

31:59.190 --> 32:02.691
I think she did the right thing,
given the circumstances.

32:03.361 --> 32:08.131
We're in too deep.
We no longer have the privilege of being...

32:08.133 --> 32:11.134
- moralistic.
- What the hell does that mean?

32:11.136 --> 32:13.202
I think your initial instinct
was right.

32:13.204 --> 32:16.572
- Initial instinct?
- That I should do what they want.

32:19.476 --> 32:21.043
I know I told you to cooperate,

32:21.045 --> 32:23.746
but you were the one who
had the strength to say no.

32:23.748 --> 32:25.248
You fought back.

32:25.250 --> 32:28.217
I admire that about you.
You made the right choice.

32:29.286 --> 32:30.952
Did I?

32:30.954 --> 32:34.222
Too many people have died since then.
You almost died.

32:34.224 --> 32:37.192
All to save one man?

32:37.194 --> 32:42.630
No, I'm not willing to sacrifice our
family for the life of Paul Kincaid.

32:43.300 --> 32:44.700
Where is that coming from?

32:46.468 --> 32:47.769
Nowhere.

32:47.771 --> 32:50.738
It's just a decision
that I have to make.

32:50.740 --> 32:52.373
That's Duncan talking.

32:54.877 --> 32:58.980
- What?
- He's been manipulating us from the start.

32:58.982 --> 33:01.749
You gotta let me in.
We gotta be together on this.

33:01.751 --> 33:04.285
If I do what he wants,
then we're free.

33:05.887 --> 33:08.790
We cannot trust him.

33:10.793 --> 33:12.092
I disagree.

33:16.932 --> 33:19.900
The guy was hard to track down
but I got an address for you.

33:19.902 --> 33:21.302
Thanks.

33:21.304 --> 33:23.236
- Do you need any help?
- No, I got it.

33:24.371 --> 33:26.873
And thanks for sticking around.

33:26.875 --> 33:28.942
Archer was right about you.

33:28.944 --> 33:31.662
You're good.

33:31.879 --> 33:34.380

38:10.148 --> 38:11.582
Guess he meant it for you.

38:27.064 --> 38:28.131
Hey.

38:31.602 --> 38:34.004
Where did you bury him?

38:34.006 --> 38:36.673
Don't think about that.
Just keep the ring.

38:52.556 --> 38:53.956
Did you kill him?

38:53.958 --> 38:56.025
I went to his apartment,
but he wasn't there.

38:56.027 --> 38:58.927
He's on a plane
to New York City right now.

38:58.929 --> 39:02.330
If he's trying to kill you,
why is he on his way to New York?

39:02.332 --> 39:04.460
Because I'm not the target.

39:05.101 --> 39:07.435
The President is.

39:07.437 --> 39:10.272
He's scheduled to be in New York
all day tomorrow.

39:10.274 --> 39:12.340
The question is, where and when?

39:12.342 --> 39:14.176
How are they planning
to take him out?

39:24.019 --> 39:25.920
Glad you could make it.

39:25.922 --> 39:29.223
- Where's my son?
- Safe and sound. With his father.

Call him if you don't believe me.

I just needed to
make sure you'd show.

39:33.663 --> 39:35.029
What do you want?

39:35.031 --> 39:37.631
I have a business proposition
for you.

39:37.633 --> 39:39.801
Low risk. High reward.

39:39.803 --> 39:42.170
My kid is the one

Better?

39:59.954 --> 40:01.421
What are you offering?

40:07.261 --> 40:11.131
He spends the morning at the UN,
but security there is far too tight.

40:11.133 --> 40:13.200
Lunch and photos at the
New York Stock Exchange

40:13.202 --> 40:15.168
and then a meeting
at the Federal Reserve.

40:15.170 --> 40:16.736
Both hard targets.

40:16.738 --> 40:18.137
Doesn't seem viable.

40:20.441 --> 40:22.174

At 5:30, the President
has scheduled a meeting

Kincaid's got the unions
in his pocket for years,

40:33.320 --> 40:36.355
and he hates Petrocelli,
he's not wasting an hour with him.

40:36.357 --> 40:37.990
Unless it's an election year.

40:37.992 --> 40:39.391
So where do you think he's going?

40:45.165 --> 40:46.431
To church.

40:46.433 --> 40:47.666
What?

40:47.668 --> 40:49.735
When I was in his camp,

40:49.737 --> 40:53.472
he always stopped by St. Theodore's
when he was in New York.

40:53.474 --> 40:55.907
The church is on Broadway and 24th,

40:55.909 --> 40:58.577
which is five minutes away
from his 4:30 meeting.

40:58.579 --> 41:01.079
- You think that's where he's going to be?
- I do.

41:02.682 --> 41:05.183
And it's the perfect place
to take him out.
