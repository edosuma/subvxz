00:01.534 --> 00:05.664
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:16.082 --> 00:19.449
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:19.519 --> 00:21.544
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:41.072
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:44.876
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:44.944 --> 00:47.344
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:47.414 --> 00:49.405
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:52.152 --> 00:54.882
<i>Dad.! Dad, you're home.!
Daddy.! Daddy.! You're here.!</i>

00:54.954 --> 00:57.946
Well, it's about time.
Mmm.

00:58.024 --> 01:02.051
<i>Arriving passenger Martin Elroy,
please report to the courtesy desk.</i>

01:02.128 --> 01:04.119
- Martin Elroy.
- What's that about?

01:04.197 --> 01:06.597
What's what about?
They just paged you.

01:06.666 --> 01:11.160
Oh. Well, I guess I was so excited to
see everybody, I didn't hear it. Oh!

01:11.237 --> 01:15.173
Well, we'll get your bags and meet you
at the curb. But don't take too long.

01:15.241 --> 01:19.735
I've got a pot roast in the oven
and somethin' special for dessert.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.477
<i>Come on.
Welcome back, Daddy.</i>

01:23.550 --> 01:28.112
<i>Attention, please. This is the final
boarding call for flight 203 to Miami.</i>

01:28.188 --> 01:32.557
<i>Look at this.</i>

01:32.625 --> 01:35.116
Just a moment, please.
You, uh-

01:42.035 --> 01:45.266
Kids?
Yea, Dad!

01:45.338 --> 01:48.273
Oh, Daddy! Oh!
I missed you, Daddy! Mmm!

01:48.341 --> 01:50.332
<i>Surprise.!
I missed you, Daddy.</i>

01:50.410 --> 01:52.344
Oh, boy.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.748
<i>Marty, aren't you glad to see us?</i>

03:10.823 --> 03:14.657
Yeah, I am. Sure.
I'm just a little surprised, that's all.

03:14.727 --> 03:17.321
It got lonely in Brooklyn, baby.

03:17.397 --> 03:21.595
I know you're here on business, but the
kids hadn't seen you in such a long time.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.262
So I checked your itinerary
and I figured,

03:24.337 --> 03:28.171
if we piled into the station wagon
and drove down right away,

03:28.241 --> 03:30.766
we'd hit Florida just when you did.

03:30.843 --> 03:35.075
<i>So, ta-da! Here we are.</i>

03:35.148 --> 03:37.412
Here they are.
So where are we staying?

03:37.483 --> 03:40.975
Well, I haven't really, uh,
checked in yet. Everybody down.

03:41.054 --> 03:45.423
I recommend the Pompano Palace. It's right on the
beach. I've been there over the years. It's a nice place.

03:45.491 --> 03:48.460
The Pompano Palace on the beach is
really great. Yes! That's beautiful.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.655
You tell 'em that Al
Calavicci sent you. And, um-

03:50.730 --> 03:53.631
- And they'll treat you first class.
- Oh, the tropics make me hot.

03:53.700 --> 03:56.567
Just tell 'em
Al Calavicci sent you.

03:56.636 --> 04:00.003
Sent me? What about you?
And who's Al Calavicci?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.735
<i>That man.
He's standing right here.</i>

04:02.809 --> 04:05.471
And he's smoking a cigar.
Can't you see him?

04:05.545 --> 04:08.207
- No.
- Uh-uh! No. No.

04:08.281 --> 04:12.479
Uh, I'm Daddy's invisible friend.
She can see us.

04:12.552 --> 04:15.578
<i>But that's not Daddy.</i>

04:15.655 --> 04:19.750
Oh, uh-Yes, it is.
It-It's Daddy in disguise.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.885
Oh.
Oh.

04:21.961 --> 04:26.091
- Daddy's in disguise.
- Where does she come up with this stuff?

04:26.165 --> 04:28.429
Probably books
and stuff that she'd be reading.

04:28.501 --> 04:31.163
Right, Dad. All the characters
in Mother Goose smoke cigars.

04:31.237 --> 04:33.705
Don't you take that tone
with your father, young man!

04:33.773 --> 04:36.435
Why don't you take the kids
and go on and check in, okay?

04:36.509 --> 04:39.376
I'll be with you soon as I can.
Aren't you coming with us?

04:39.445 --> 04:42.380
Uh, I gotta make a stop first.
What kind of stop?

04:42.448 --> 04:44.916
Well, you're a traveling salesman
for Bestway Brushes.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.350
I'm a traveling salesman. I
knew you're a traveling salesman.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.752
You cover a lot of territory.
Of course you know that.

04:49.822 --> 04:52.848
But I got to meet a client
about a big sale. Big sale?

04:52.925 --> 04:54.153
Big brushes.
Big brushes.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.524
For big brushes?
Yeah.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.189
You better get out of here
before "you know who" shows up.

04:58.264 --> 05:01.358
Daddy's friend, Al, wants us to go now.
He says someone's looking for Daddy.

05:01.434 --> 05:03.959
Marty, have you been
gambling again? What?

05:04.037 --> 05:06.028
- Mmm.
- Al says yes.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.665
Don't lie to me, Marty.
You know it makes me crazy.

05:08.741 --> 05:11.141
She's talking to my invisible friend.
Don't forget that.

05:11.210 --> 05:14.373
Oh! Right.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.938
It must be the humidity.
All right. Come on. Yeah.

05:17.016 --> 05:19.541
Okay. I'll see you all later.
Huh?

05:19.619 --> 05:22.053
Where are you taking us
for dinner?

05:22.121 --> 05:25.682
Um, I'm not sure that I'll be able
to make it back in time for dinner.

05:25.758 --> 05:29.524
Marty Elroy, are you up to no
good? I'll be there for dinner.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.100
Let's go! Move it. Move it.
Bye, Dad.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.659
<i>Bye, Al.</i>

05:37.737 --> 05:40.331
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.333
Oh, boy.

05:49.782 --> 05:52.012
What's wrong?

05:52.085 --> 05:55.748
What's wrong?
Al, I'm a bigamist!

06:03.996 --> 06:07.762
Can you believe this? I got a wife in
Brooklyn and a wife in Pompano Beach.

06:07.834 --> 06:11.361
Yeah. Seems like a great setup.
Uh, unless they meet.

06:11.437 --> 06:14.270
That's what Ziggy says you're
here to do, is to keep 'em apart.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.365
For how long?
Don't know.

06:16.442 --> 06:19.343
I mean, Marty had no idea that
Rachel was coming to Florida.

06:19.412 --> 06:23.974
Which one's Rachel? Uh, the last one.
The one that gets hot in the tropics.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.712
Eh, her kids areJosh and Jessica.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.448
Now, the wife that wants you
for dessert is Ellen.

06:29.522 --> 06:32.013
Her kids are Mary and Martin.
Mary Martin?

06:32.091 --> 06:35.026
<i>Yeah. Peter Pan was big in the
'50s. Yeah, but where's Tinkerbell?</i>

06:35.094 --> 06:37.619
That's your dog. You got
a pedigreed greyhound. Al-

06:37.697 --> 06:41.633
<i>- Marty.! Yoo-hoo.!
- I got a greyhound for a pet?</i>

06:41.701 --> 06:46.365
Yeah. Uh, you're a big fan of the dog races,
and you bought Tinkerbell for an investment.

06:46.439 --> 06:51.399
Now listen, have fun with Ellen,
but don't be late for Rachel.

06:52.945 --> 06:55.937
Ah, gee. This is my kinda leap!

06:57.617 --> 07:00.017
<i>Dad.! Hurry up.!
Let's go, honey.</i>

07:04.957 --> 07:07.482
<i>Uh, what's been goin'on
since I've been gone?</i>

07:07.560 --> 07:09.721
I got an "A" on my science project.

07:09.796 --> 07:12.856
Yeah? Oh, that's great.
Uh, what was it about?

07:12.932 --> 07:15.230
Uh, static electricity.
Oh, yeah. Right.

07:15.301 --> 07:18.202
He proved why clothes
stick together in the dryer.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.239
That's great.

07:20.306 --> 07:22.797
And Mary had her checkup
at the dentist. Good.

07:22.875 --> 07:26.242
No cavities!
That's great too.

07:27.413 --> 07:30.246
You said you'd bring them
a reward, remember?

07:30.316 --> 07:34.082
Rewa- Of course.
This is definitely a time for rewards.

07:34.153 --> 07:37.554
Just gotta
- Where did I put those, uh, rewards?

07:37.623 --> 07:39.887
You usually put them
in your tote bag.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.326
Right! Right.
They're in my tote bag. Okay?

07:45.097 --> 07:47.531
I'll go get it.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.136
I, uh, finished that special
math assignment you gave me.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.436
Oh, good.

07:57.376 --> 08:00.368
You handicapped the dog races
for me? You owe me three bucks.

08:00.446 --> 08:03.142
<i>What?
Here we are.! Reward time.!</i>

08:03.216 --> 08:06.151
<i>Okay.! Reward time.</i>

08:07.720 --> 08:09.950
All right. Let's see
what we got in here.

08:10.022 --> 08:14.322
Uh, something should be in here
for Marty. There we go!

08:14.393 --> 08:18.659
MartyJr. And Mary.
There you are.

08:18.731 --> 08:21.564
A shoehorn?
From the Fiesta Hotel?

08:21.634 --> 08:23.499
Very practical.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.935
Yeah, but it's what
you got me last time.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.701
But you got two feet, right?

08:28.774 --> 08:32.835
Look! A disposable shower cap.

08:34.780 --> 08:39.149
Well, I know I got a lot more
stuff in here, you know,

08:39.217 --> 08:41.880
so just don't panic.

08:43.155 --> 08:46.283
Excuse me. I have to go
study for my history test.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.351
<i>I thought your history test
wasn't until next week.</i>

08:49.428 --> 08:51.589
- It's a big test.
- Maybe I can help.

08:51.664 --> 08:54.224
It's not about the horse races.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.667
How come Mom always gets
more presents than we do?

08:57.737 --> 09:00.831
Because she's-
she's the mother.

09:01.841 --> 09:05.834
Come on. Uh, there's gotta
be more stuff in here.

09:08.848 --> 09:13.547
That's it! I told you last time, I'm not
taking my lunch to school in a barf bag!

09:13.619 --> 09:17.385
Don't you take that tone
with your father, young man!

09:21.127 --> 09:23.288
I gotta go.
Where?

09:23.362 --> 09:26.627
Got to go! Well, I got a
meeting, you know. After dinner?

09:26.699 --> 09:31.636
Yeah. Well, uh, the client
is a guy from, uh, Tokyo, see?

09:31.704 --> 09:33.865
And over in Tokyo right now,
it's morning.

09:33.940 --> 09:37.103
And this guy, he's-he's
still stuck on Tokyo time.

09:37.176 --> 09:40.839
But it's movie night, Martin. You
know Friday night is movie night.

09:40.913 --> 09:45.976
Yeah, well
- There's a cartoonarama at the theater, and the children love cartoons.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.418
Yes.
And you promised.

09:48.487 --> 09:52.082
But don't you understand? Is there
something you're not telling me, Martin?

09:52.158 --> 09:54.149
Like perhaps you're
going to the track?

09:54.226 --> 09:57.821
No! No! I'm not going to the
track. No, I'm not. Really.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.832
Listen, how about if we go, uh,
to the movies tomorrow night?

10:00.900 --> 10:02.834
Tomorrow night?
Yeah.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.962
Is our night. Remember?
Oh.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.029
Naughty schoolgirl night?

10:11.611 --> 10:15.547
Okay. Well, then why don't you go
to the movies, and I'll meet you?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.846
How's that? Okay?
All right. I'll-

10:18.918 --> 10:21.478
Are you forgetting something?
Am I forgetting some-

10:21.554 --> 10:23.522
Oh! Yeah. Okay.

10:23.589 --> 10:26.285
Mmm.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.987
<i>Mmm.!</i>

10:30.596 --> 10:33.827
I missed you, babe.
What took you so long?

10:33.899 --> 10:38.666
It was a long meeting with a lot of, uh,
big brushes that we had to talk about.

10:38.738 --> 10:41.901
The kids were getting antsy,
so I had to order in.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.965
Eat, Marty.
What's the matter?

10:44.043 --> 10:46.705
Well, I'm just not in the mood
for pizza today, that's all.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.747
I'm in the mood for you.

10:48.814 --> 10:52.079
Tonight's chambermaid night,
remember?

10:52.151 --> 10:55.382
<i>Hey, Dad.! Look what I got.!</i>

10:55.454 --> 10:59.720
We got Kleenex,
shoehorns, shower caps.

10:59.792 --> 11:03.228
I got towels, two bars of soap,

11:03.295 --> 11:05.229
sewing kits...

11:05.297 --> 11:08.357
and last, but certainly not least,
two rolls of toilet paper!

11:08.434 --> 11:11.335
- Where'd you get all that stuff?
- I raided the maid's cart.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.669
- You can't steal from the maid!
- Why not? You taught me how to do it.

11:14.740 --> 11:17.436
We need a bath mat.
One bath mat coming up.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.343
<i>No.! No.! Wait a sec-
Josh, get back here.! Jo- No.!</i>

11:20.413 --> 11:23.211
No, thank you. L- I-I
don't feel like it. Come on.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.409
<i>Daddy. Daddy.! What's this for?</i>

11:25.484 --> 11:28.044
Ah, look at that!

11:28.120 --> 11:30.850
I haven't seen one of those
since 19-

11:30.923 --> 11:33.756
<i>Since the last time
I was in a really nice hotel.</i>

11:33.826 --> 11:37.284
See, you, um-You take a dime,
right, and you put it in there.

11:37.363 --> 11:42.062
And then you turn it on. And it makes
the whole bed shake, kinda like a massage.

11:42.134 --> 11:45.297
I know another way to
make the bed shake. Mm-hmm.

11:46.639 --> 11:50.598
I've got a dime. Well, here.
Let me have it. I'll turn it on.

11:50.676 --> 11:53.873
I'm no thief. Come on.
And I'm no sucker.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.437
<i>A Massage-omatic. You apologize
to your father right now.</i>

11:56.515 --> 12:00.417
<i>One time Ruthie and I were in Cleveland, and we had
one of those things running for nine hours straight.</i>

12:00.486 --> 12:02.477
<i>This is so fun!
There was nothin'else to do.</i>

12:02.555 --> 12:05.388
- Al, I don't want to hear about it.
- But, Marty, she's giving you lip.

12:05.458 --> 12:09.087
<i>He's not talking to you.
He's talking to his invisible friend.</i>

12:12.998 --> 12:15.990
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- Me first!

12:16.068 --> 12:18.502
What? Wait, wait, wait! Wait
a second! I'm gonna beat you!

12:18.571 --> 12:20.801
Make sure you open the window
when you're done, honey.

12:20.873 --> 12:23.637
<i>Sam, I'll meet you in the hall.
I'll use the one in the lobby.</i>

12:26.679 --> 12:28.670
What did you find out, Al?

12:28.748 --> 12:32.343
Well, I was talking to the real
Marty. I think I found a new idol.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.319
Idol? Al!
The guy's a bigamist!

12:35.387 --> 12:37.719
Look at that guy.
I know. But think about it.

12:37.790 --> 12:42.659
If I had tried that, I could have
- I could've gone through 10 wives instead of five!

12:42.728 --> 12:44.719
Al.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.958
I got Rachel and her kids
to the hotel.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.364
I got Ellen and her kids
to the house. Uh-huh.

12:49.435 --> 12:53.428
They didn't bump into each other. I did what I
was supposed to do. Now, why haven't I leaped?

12:53.506 --> 12:55.633
That's not what you
were supposed to do.

12:55.708 --> 12:59.269
That's what you said I was supposed
to do! That was just the first part.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.336
Okay. Okay.
What's the second part?

13:01.413 --> 13:04.405
Well, now Ziggy's saying
there's a 75% chance...

13:04.483 --> 13:08.112
that you're here because Marty's
only supposed to have one wife.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.121
What?

13:10.189 --> 13:14.091
All right. Okay. Well, then-then which
one? Oh, you're not gonna like this.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.960
Well, just have Ziggy tell me
which wife I'm supposed to pick, okay?

13:18.030 --> 13:19.998
No. No. It's not that easy.
Just tell me.

13:20.065 --> 13:23.262
I know. But each one has
strengths and weaknesses. Al.

13:23.335 --> 13:26.133
And pluses and "minuseses. "
Al!

13:27.273 --> 13:30.367
The odds are, uh, 50-50.

13:31.577 --> 13:34.171
Fifty- Oh, boy.

13:38.384 --> 13:41.353
<i>How am I gonna pick somebody
if the odds are 50-50?</i>

13:41.420 --> 13:43.752
Well, which one do you like?
Huh?

13:47.092 --> 13:50.789
I don't know.
Um, which one do you like?

13:50.863 --> 13:52.797
Me?
Yeah.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.333
I don't know.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.335
Rachel.
Ellen?

13:57.403 --> 13:59.337
Rachel?
Ellen?

13:59.405 --> 14:02.067
You and Ellen?
What do ya mean, me and Ellen?

14:02.141 --> 14:04.632
What are ya laughing at?
She's not your type.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.304
I mean, Rachel's the one
with the vibrating bed.

14:07.379 --> 14:10.212
Is that why you picked her?
No. No. It's not the reason.

14:10.282 --> 14:13.115
I don't know why I picked her, Al.

14:13.185 --> 14:16.552
I guess because it seems like she needs
more help straightening out her life.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.090
Ellen seems stronger, you know,
more put together.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.991
Hmm. Well, I love-

14:23.929 --> 14:27.524
I love taking things apart...
and foolin' with 'em. Al.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.534
Yeah?

14:29.602 --> 14:31.934
Who does Marty think
that he should pick?

14:32.004 --> 14:34.131
He can't make up
his mind either.

14:34.206 --> 14:38.870
He married Ellen first, so technically
she's got three years of seniority.

14:38.944 --> 14:42.880
What about Rachel? Oh, that's kinda
romantic. He married her on a bet.

14:42.948 --> 14:47.214
A bet? Yeah. She works as a cocktail
waitress at the Long Island Turf Club.

14:47.286 --> 14:50.722
And he bet her that she couldn't
stay married to him for one year.

14:50.789 --> 14:53.724
And they're celebrating their
ninth anniversary next month.

14:53.792 --> 14:57.990
Great. Great. How's that gonna help me
pick? Right? Somebody's gonna get hurt here.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.590
Well, Marty can only have one wife.
What a shame.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.658
Al.
Huh?

15:05.004 --> 15:06.972
How am I gonna choose which one?

15:07.039 --> 15:08.973
Well, you get to know them
a little bit.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.032
You have dessert with Ellen.

15:11.110 --> 15:14.944
You-You fan Rachel's little
hot tropical flame there.

15:15.014 --> 15:18.450
And
- But right now you better forget that and get to the theater.

15:18.517 --> 15:21.850
Oh, God! Oh!
I'll see you later.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.482
Rachel, listen, I-I know you drove all
the way down here to see me and everything,

15:25.557 --> 15:29.721
but, uh, right now I have this very
important meeting that I have to get to, okay?

15:29.795 --> 15:31.922
Didn't you have a meetin'
this afternoon?

15:31.997 --> 15:34.989
Yes. But this is a meeting
about that meeting.

15:35.067 --> 15:37.331
See? So I'll be back
in just a second, okay?

15:37.403 --> 15:39.769
You're making me crazy again, Marty!

15:39.838 --> 15:42.329
We drove all the way down
here to see you. I know, but-

15:42.408 --> 15:46.469
Sam. Maybe you shouldn't go because Ziggy says there's
a 50-50 chance you're supposed to be here with Rachel.

15:46.545 --> 15:49.673
Look, then I'm gonna be late
for the other appointment.

15:49.748 --> 15:52.740
Jessica missed her piano recital,
and Josh missed his play...

15:52.818 --> 15:56.151
all because they wanted to
spend time with their father.

15:56.221 --> 15:59.952
Okay. All right. But, you see,
I can't be in two places at once.

16:00.025 --> 16:02.425
<i>I'm having palpitations.</i>

16:02.494 --> 16:04.985
You?
Yeah. All right. Look. Look.

16:05.064 --> 16:07.726
Okay. All right. Just sit down.
Open the door! Come on!

16:07.800 --> 16:10.564
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll cancel my meeting. Okay?

16:10.636 --> 16:14.595
You can't do that! No! Ziggy says there's a
50-50 chance you're supposed to be with Ellen.

16:14.673 --> 16:19.076
All right! Okay! Um, and I'll tell you
what. Instead, let's all go to the movies.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.772
Oh! Oh! Oh! You really
mean it? Okay? Yeah. Sure.

16:21.847 --> 16:24.645
<i>Oh, how about we all go see
Chainsaw Massacre in the Sand?</i>

16:24.717 --> 16:28.414
<i>Or Invaders from Uranus? How 'bout that,
huh? No. We're going to the cartoonarama.</i>

16:28.487 --> 16:31.217
Oh, Dad, I hate cartoons. I'm
sick of cartoons. Yeah, well-

16:31.290 --> 16:33.554
- Sounds dangerous to me, Sam.
- You got a better idea?

16:33.625 --> 16:36.594
I just gave you two.
Josh, stop whining!

16:36.662 --> 16:38.596
Mom!

16:38.664 --> 16:41.132
Come on, Jessica!

16:41.200 --> 16:44.192
I'm ready. Okay! Last one to
the car's a rotten egg! Let's go!

16:44.269 --> 16:46.203
I get to sit in the front.
No, I do.

16:46.271 --> 16:48.466
No, you just did last time-
It's Jessica's turn, Joshua.

16:48.540 --> 16:52.533
That's it! It's my turn! No lip
from you, or you stay right here!

16:54.113 --> 16:56.308
I can't wait
to see the cartoon!

17:04.923 --> 17:07.517
Josh.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.153
I know how you feel.

17:10.229 --> 17:13.721
Sometimes it's tough
being an older brother.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.867
Things don't always seem fair.

17:19.938 --> 17:23.305
But your little sister
is too young to understand.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.569
That's why we make excuses for her-

17:25.644 --> 17:28.772
<i>because we're more grown up
than she is.</i>

17:28.847 --> 17:33.443
- Come on, Dad.
- "Come on" what?

17:33.519 --> 17:36.920
Whenever we have a heart-to-heart,
the next thing you do is you hit me up for cash.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.549
- What?
- And you know I'm tapped out.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.594
<i>You borrowed my allowance, and then
you raided my piggy bank. Wait. Wait.</i>

17:42.661 --> 17:45.221
<i>I'm broke. Wait! I don't
want your allowance.</i>

17:45.297 --> 17:50.098
<i>I could see you were upset, and I care about
you. I just wanted to talk to you about it.</i>

17:50.169 --> 17:52.660
I hate when you beg.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.206
This is the last time.
This is the last time.

17:55.274 --> 17:58.175
This is 52 cents.
It's the last of my lunch money.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.406
Just don't spend it all
in one place. Okay?

18:03.916 --> 18:08.319
I think I'd better go get Ziggy
to see if she can tilt these odds.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.866
I, uh, have to go to the bathroom.

18:31.944 --> 18:36.176
You just spent 20 minutes in the bathroom at
the hotel. When you gotta go, you gotta go.

18:36.248 --> 18:37.909
I want popcorn!
Me too! And a hot dog!

18:37.983 --> 18:39.473
And I want a black cow.
Me too!

18:39.551 --> 18:42.247
<i>I want licorice sticks and I want
french fries. Okay? Yeah. Me too!</i>

18:42.321 --> 18:44.915
Get me an ice cream bar.
Okay. Popcorn for everybody.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.924
<i>A hot dog! Black cow.
Black cow. Black cow.!</i>

18:46.992 --> 18:49.984
<i>Two hot dogs. Two black cows. French fries.
Licorice. I want french fries.! Some licorice.!</i>

18:50.062 --> 18:52.929
And an ice cream "bah. "
And an ice cream "bah"- bar.

18:52.998 --> 18:57.059
Here's five dollars. And remember,
Marty, I count the change.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.556
Look who's here! Dad!

19:18.624 --> 19:23.891
Oh, what a nice surprise!
And the races aren't even over yet.

19:23.962 --> 19:26.226
And here I am.
How about that?

19:35.274 --> 19:38.004
I'm gonna go get some popcorn.
I'll be right back, okay?

19:38.076 --> 19:42.012
Martin, honey, we don't get
popcorn until intermission.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.942
It's fresher now.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.510
Just sit still and watch the movie.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.186
- I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Me too.

19:58.263 --> 20:00.197
- Not until intermission.
- I can't hold it.

20:01.633 --> 20:04.431
All right.

20:08.807 --> 20:11.469
<i>There you go- two popcorns
and one orangejuice.</i>

20:11.543 --> 20:14.171
Hey, you go ahead, all right?
I thought you had to go.

20:14.246 --> 20:18.342
I'm gonna go later. I'm gonna get a soda,
and I'll meet you back in the theater, okay?

20:18.417 --> 20:21.477
Okay. Two popcorns,
three black cows-

20:23.055 --> 20:25.888
Jessica. Hi.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.883
What are you doing out here?

20:28.961 --> 20:31.259
Mommy wants to know
what's taking so long.

20:31.330 --> 20:35.289
The line in the men's room was long.
But the food line's a lot shorter.

20:35.367 --> 20:39.827
So I'll get all the food, and I'll
meet you back inside with Mommy.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.896
Hmm. Okay.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.736
Whew!

20:48.814 --> 20:52.409
All right. Get a pencil and paper
'cause this is a lot of stuff here.

20:52.484 --> 20:55.749
Three popcorns,
two brown cows, french fries,

20:55.821 --> 20:58.881
<i>licorice, two hot dogs
and an ice cream bar.</i>

20:58.957 --> 21:01.653
Okay. Thank you, sir.
That should be 2.95.

21:07.833 --> 21:11.428
What is all this? It's just
a little snack, that's all.

21:11.503 --> 21:14.097
Dad says they gave it to him for free.
He was the 100th customer.

21:14.172 --> 21:17.141
Oh, my! That ice cream bar
sure looks yummy.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.700
Wait a minute. You said we wouldn't
eat anything till intermission.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.110
<i>Look, a hot dog. Licorice
sticks forJunior and black cows!</i>

21:22.180 --> 21:24.774
You remembered I love black
cows! All right. Hold it!

21:27.419 --> 21:30.582
The guy forgot my ketchup.
I'll be right back.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.647
<i>Excuse me.!</i>

21:48.507 --> 21:51.203
Here I am!
What took so long?

21:51.276 --> 21:53.836
<i>Well-
Where's my hot dog?</i>

21:53.912 --> 21:57.814
Where's my licorice? Where's Mom's ice
cream bar? Give me that! That's mine!

21:57.883 --> 22:00.374
Give it to me! Give it
back to me! Give it back!

22:00.452 --> 22:02.443
Give it back to me! It's
mine! I had it first!

22:02.521 --> 22:05.979
Can you believe the guy forgot
to put 'em in there? He was-

22:06.058 --> 22:08.822
I'll be right back.

22:11.063 --> 22:14.328
Junior, keep an eye on your sister.
I'm going to look for your father.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.371
That's it. That's it!

22:22.441 --> 22:24.534
He's probably on the phone
placing a bet.

22:24.609 --> 22:28.670
<i>Josh, watch your sister. I'm going to
give your father a piece of my mind.</i>

22:28.747 --> 22:31.238
<i>Oh, my God.!
Look at the goodies.!</i>

22:31.316 --> 22:33.716
Look at that popcorn!
Look at the ice cream bar!

22:33.785 --> 22:36.845
Al, this ice cream bar could
ruin his marriage. Which one?

22:36.922 --> 22:38.981
<i>Babe?</i>

22:39.991 --> 22:42.016
<i>Uh-oh.
Honey?</i>

22:42.094 --> 22:46.030
<i>Uh-oh. Sam, do something. Hide.!
Quick.! Quick.! Quick.! Quick.! Quick.!</i>

22:46.098 --> 22:48.032
<i>Honey.!</i>

22:48.100 --> 22:50.933
<i>Babe?</i>

22:51.002 --> 22:52.993
Honey!

22:57.376 --> 22:59.867
<i>Stay low, Sam.!</i>

23:03.548 --> 23:06.813
<i>Going, going, going-
You got away with it this time, Sam.</i>

23:06.885 --> 23:08.876
Whew. Wow.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.622
Al!

23:15.961 --> 23:17.895
Where's your ice cream bar?
Huh?

23:17.963 --> 23:20.124
Your ice cream bar?

23:20.198 --> 23:23.998
Oh, no! Oh, man! You stepped
on your ice cream bar.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.060
Sam! And you need
more popcorn.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.572
I don't have a dime.
I don't have anything at all.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.074
Oh, whoa! Whoa!
I don't wanna hear you say that!

23:31.143 --> 23:35.739
You know how that makes me
feel. Bicarb. Do I know you guys?

23:35.814 --> 23:39.875
No hard I.D.'s on these guys, but knowing
how Marty gambled, they're probably gamblers.

23:39.951 --> 23:43.853
Gus, don't you hate it when they do that?
Don't you hate it when they say that?

23:43.922 --> 23:46.652
"I forgot it. "
"I left it in my other pants. "

23:46.725 --> 23:49.250
"I had to bail my Aunt Frieda
out of jail. "

23:49.327 --> 23:52.660
Marty, you know better than this.

23:52.731 --> 23:55.359
I mean, I'm ashamed of you.
Al?

23:55.434 --> 23:59.097
You know that this
is movie night.

23:59.171 --> 24:03.505
And on movie night
we always go and take a little walk...

24:03.575 --> 24:06.271
and have our little chat.

24:06.344 --> 24:10.747
Uh, so, yeah. H
- How did you like the movie tonight, you guys?

24:10.816 --> 24:12.977
We don't review the picture.

24:13.051 --> 24:17.215
But, you know, on the other hand,
I liked the movie very much.

24:17.289 --> 24:21.055
I love happy endings.
I hate it when a movie makes me cry.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.219
It's part of my sensitive nature.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.889
<i>I wouldn't go see Bambi then.
It's a real tearjerker.</i>

24:25.964 --> 24:28.592
Don't be smart, Marty. I hate it
when you're smart. Hey, you nozzle!

24:28.667 --> 24:31.363
If you were really smart,
you wouldn't owe us two grand again.

24:31.436 --> 24:34.200
Two grand.

24:34.272 --> 24:37.537
Isn't that a coincidence?
That's exactly what you owe us-

24:37.609 --> 24:39.804
<i>two thousand again.!</i>

24:43.415 --> 24:45.747
Listen, Marty-

24:45.817 --> 24:49.878
two thousand, 24 hours.

24:49.955 --> 24:52.947
Please get the money.

24:53.024 --> 24:55.049
You know me-

24:55.126 --> 24:57.560
that sensitive,
artistic side of me.

24:57.629 --> 25:02.692
Every time Gus here breaks thumbs,
I get indigestion for a week.

25:02.767 --> 25:05.668
<i>It's that crunching,
cracking sound. I just-</i>

25:09.274 --> 25:11.265
Hey. Here.

25:13.078 --> 25:15.546
Buy your kids some popcorn.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.922
<i>Whoever said "hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned';...</i>

25:35.000 --> 25:36.991
<i>never scorned two women.</i>

25:37.068 --> 25:41.232
<i>And even though I had two wives,
I wound up sleeping on a park bench.</i>

25:41.306 --> 25:44.400
<i>I would have liked to have given them
more time to cool off,</i>

25:44.476 --> 25:47.741
<i>but my solar plexus kept reminding me
that Vic and Gus meant business.</i>

25:47.812 --> 25:49.746
<i>Shut up, Jake.!</i>

25:54.819 --> 25:58.653
I know you don't want to talk to me,
but could you just at least listen?

26:02.861 --> 26:07.662
I'm really sorry about last night, and
I really need to talk to your mother.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.791
She already left for work,

26:09.868 --> 26:12.996
and she told me not to let you in
if you showed up.

26:13.071 --> 26:16.006
Look, Marty, you're a little
young to understand all this,

26:16.074 --> 26:19.100
but your dad's in big trouble.

26:19.177 --> 26:22.578
Dad, you've been in trouble
since I can remember.

26:22.647 --> 26:25.582
You missed my first Little League game
because of opening day at Hialeah.

26:25.650 --> 26:29.814
You hocked my Christmas presents last
year. This time the cupboard's bare.

26:29.888 --> 26:32.652
No. No. L-I didn't come here
asking for money, okay?

26:32.724 --> 26:36.626
Uh, could I at least come in
and take a shower?

26:36.695 --> 26:38.686
Hold on a second.

26:47.872 --> 26:50.033
Here.
What are you doin'?

26:50.108 --> 26:53.305
I hope this helps.
No. L-I don't want the money.

26:53.378 --> 26:55.539
Take it.

26:55.614 --> 26:59.710
Think of it as a loan, okay?
I'll- I'll put it on your tab.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.979
Just take it.

27:02.053 --> 27:06.490
<i>Look, I'm really sorry I hocked
your Christmas presents...</i>

27:06.558 --> 27:09.891
and missed all your
Little League games.

27:09.961 --> 27:12.486
Somehow, I'm gonna try
and make it up to you.

27:14.232 --> 27:16.393
Okay. You can come in.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.130
But I still have to check
your pockets when you leave.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.307
Yeah.

27:27.145 --> 27:30.046
<i>Coming.</i>

27:32.651 --> 27:34.949
<i>Bad time, Dad.
Oh, wait a second.</i>

27:35.020 --> 27:37.011
I really need to talk to your mom.

27:37.088 --> 27:39.579
No. I don't think it's a good idea.
I just want to apologize, okay?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.558
Do you think she'll see me?

27:41.626 --> 27:45.084
Well, she's not here. She went
to get her hair done. Where?

27:45.163 --> 27:47.495
At the beauty parlor in the lobby.

27:47.565 --> 27:50.500
Wait, Dad. How much money
do you need this time?

27:50.568 --> 27:53.560
None. L-I'm fine.

27:53.638 --> 27:55.572
Take this.
Josh.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.404
No. No. No.
Take it. Take it. Take it.

27:58.476 --> 28:01.604
Look
- My mom keeps some extra cash in the jewelry box.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.411
She gave that to me to buy some souvenirs
for Aunt Renee and Uncle Harvey.

28:05.483 --> 28:09.351
But- But I-I guess I can give 'em
the bath mat instead.

28:09.421 --> 28:12.913
<i>You don't understand. No.
No, Dad. Just take it, please?</i>

28:12.991 --> 28:18.429
And-And maybe you should just
leave Mom alone for a while. Okay?

28:24.936 --> 28:27.427
<i>I have two darling children.</i>

28:27.505 --> 28:31.566
Josh is eight, and Jessica's five.
How many do you have?

28:31.643 --> 28:34.703
Two. Or three,
if you count my husband.

28:37.782 --> 28:41.047
Would you like it up or down?

28:41.119 --> 28:43.053
What do you think?
Huh.

28:43.121 --> 28:45.954
<i>If I don't come up
with $2,000 by tonight,</i>

28:46.024 --> 28:48.959
<i>I'm the one who's gonna have
the broken thumb.</i>

28:49.027 --> 28:51.359
No, you're not gonna
have a broken thumb. No?

28:51.429 --> 28:54.489
You're gonna have two broken
thumbs. That's Vic's trademark. Oh.

28:54.566 --> 28:58.525
He takes 'em and he bends 'em back and
twists 'em over like this. Thanks, Al.

28:58.603 --> 29:03.563
That's enough, okay? You may not like it, but you're
gonna have to get that money from Ellen or Rachel.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.871
I personally think
that Ellen is the soft touch.

29:05.944 --> 29:08.674
I really don't know why I
put up with my husband.

29:08.747 --> 29:12.615
I guess it's because
deep down he has-

29:12.684 --> 29:16.051
I don't know
what he has deep down.

29:16.121 --> 29:19.147
Sometimes I worry
about my kids.

29:19.224 --> 29:21.419
Junior looks up
to his father so much.

29:21.493 --> 29:24.121
I'm afraid he's gonna be in
for a big disappointment.

29:24.195 --> 29:27.358
My husband isn't much of a father.
He thinks I should raise the kids.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.593
We have a very traditional family.

29:29.667 --> 29:32.158
So you don't work?
No. I work.

29:32.237 --> 29:34.831
I'm a cocktail waitress
at the Turf Club.

29:34.906 --> 29:37.773
Gambling makes me sick.
Oh, me too.

29:37.842 --> 29:40.538
At least my husband doesn't
gamble. Oh, neither does mine.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.546
Thank goodness.
Thank God.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.845
I can't imagine what it would be like
to be married to a gambler.

29:45.917 --> 29:49.444
Absolute hell.
Not that I would know.

29:49.521 --> 29:53.423
<i>You're gonna have a hell of a time
getting a handout from either one of'em.</i>

29:53.491 --> 29:56.358
<i>Which is why I need to know
which wife I'm supposed to choose.</i>

29:56.427 --> 30:00.864
What's it got to do with the
2,000 clams? Because Ziggy said...

30:00.932 --> 30:04.891
that I'm here to pick between
Rachel and Ellen, right? Right.

30:04.969 --> 30:08.871
I've been running around between both families,
trying to decide which family needs me the most.

30:08.940 --> 30:11.135
And I still don't have
an answer, right? Right.

30:11.209 --> 30:14.508
So- So I've gonna go to Ra-

30:14.579 --> 30:16.513
Gesundheit.
Thank you.

30:16.581 --> 30:19.049
I gotta go to Rachel
and hit her up for $2,000,

30:19.117 --> 30:21.642
I better make sure- darn
sure- that it's not her. Right.

30:21.719 --> 30:24.847
Because if it is, then she's never
gonna speak to me again. Wait a second.

30:24.923 --> 30:28.188
Then I'll never leap outta here. I'll be stuck in the
- Ziggy's freaking out here.

30:28.259 --> 30:31.092
What's she saying? She says
get the hell away from the win.

30:31.162 --> 30:34.393
The win? The what?
Dow.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.399
Dow?
Oh, the window.

30:36.467 --> 30:40.267
Get the hell away from the-
Ooh, the window!

30:40.338 --> 30:44.001
<i>Get away from the window, quick.!
Quick.! Quick.!</i>

30:44.075 --> 30:48.239
No wonder Ziggy's freakin' out. They're
probably talking about you in there right now!

30:51.316 --> 30:53.978
<i>- Do they know?
- No, I don't think so.</i>

30:54.052 --> 30:57.920
<i>Because Ellen is just fixing Rachel's hair.
She's not pulling it out.</i>

30:57.989 --> 31:00.890
Al, why didn't you tell me
that Ellen worked in there?

31:00.959 --> 31:02.893
You never asked me to
check on it! All right.

31:02.961 --> 31:06.624
I want you to go in there and listen
to what they're saying, okay?

31:06.698 --> 31:10.190
I'm gonna figure out some way to get one
of'em out of there. How you gonna do that?

31:10.268 --> 31:12.259
I don't know! I just-
Ah.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.466
I'll call
- I'll call 'em on the phone. Which one?

31:16.541 --> 31:19.032
I don't know! Just go! Go on!

31:20.144 --> 31:22.135
I grew up on fairy tales.

31:23.381 --> 31:27.112
My mother always told me that Prince
Charming would come along on a white horse...

31:27.185 --> 31:29.119
and sweep me off my feet.

31:29.187 --> 31:32.748
She didn't tell you Prince Charming would
have two grand riding on that horse, I bet.

31:32.824 --> 31:37.124
My mother- God rest her soul- told me, "Rachel,
you can put up with just about anything from a man.

31:37.195 --> 31:40.687
He's a slob? Forget it.
He stays out with the boys? Who cares?"

31:40.765 --> 31:45.395
I like Mom already. "The only thing that counts,
Rachelah, is that he doesn't fool around. "

31:45.470 --> 31:47.938
But not very much.
Amen to that.

31:48.006 --> 31:51.464
And, you know, isn't it funny that
the wife is always the last to know?

31:51.542 --> 31:54.340
Oh, I'd know.
They always think they'd know.

31:54.412 --> 31:57.074
You would be surprised
how these poor darlings find out.

31:57.148 --> 31:59.639
Not as surprised
as you sweeties are gonna be.

31:59.717 --> 32:04.154
It happened to a friend of mine. She overheard
it in the powder room at Gage and Toners.

32:04.222 --> 32:06.850
That's how she found out her husband
was seeing another woman?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.916
No. Another man!
No!

32:08.993 --> 32:11.723
Yuck!
Swear. My husband told me.

32:11.796 --> 32:14.264
Oh! Well, what does he do
for a living?

32:14.332 --> 32:16.323
He's in sales.
Uh, Sam!

32:16.401 --> 32:19.529
<i>Mine too.
What type of sales?</i>

32:19.604 --> 32:22.095
- Is there a Rachel Elroy here?
- That's me.

32:22.173 --> 32:24.107
- Oh, thank God.
- You have a phone call.

32:24.175 --> 32:26.143
Oh!

32:26.210 --> 32:28.201
My last name is Elroy too.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.509
Really? Maybe we're related.

32:30.581 --> 32:32.572
Closer than you think, honey.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.111
Thank you.

32:38.189 --> 32:40.123
Hello?
Rachel.

32:40.191 --> 32:45.151
- Oh, you. - Rachel, don't
hang up. J- Just hear me out.

32:45.229 --> 32:49.825
Now look, I know
that I'm a no-good louse...

32:49.901 --> 32:51.835
and a terrible father.

32:51.903 --> 32:54.872
- And a terrible husband!
- And I'm a terrible husband.

32:54.939 --> 32:58.067
And I'm lower than pond scum.

32:58.142 --> 33:01.475
And I'm low-
A really terrible husband.

33:01.546 --> 33:04.037
You got a point?

33:04.115 --> 33:07.551
The point is, I want to make it up to
you. I want to turn over a new leaf.

33:07.618 --> 33:11.918
- You're not gettin' a dime from me.
- No, this isn't about money.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.981
I left you a note on your car.

33:15.093 --> 33:17.027
What's it say?

33:17.095 --> 33:20.656
- If you want to know, you have to go read it.
- That's a good one, Sam.

33:20.732 --> 33:24.361
I'll think about it. Ah, don't pay
any attention to that. She's hooked.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.999
Keep the change, doll.

33:33.077 --> 33:37.173
Ah, Sam, that note idea is brilliant.
I'm impressed.

33:37.248 --> 33:39.273
Thanks.
"Thanks. " So?

33:39.350 --> 33:42.251
So?
So what'd the note say?

33:43.287 --> 33:46.120
All the right things.
Like?

33:46.190 --> 33:48.556
Believe me, she'll love the note.
Oh, okay.

33:48.626 --> 33:52.426
I figured it out, Al! I know why I'm
here! I know what Marty doesn't know.

33:52.497 --> 33:55.523
Tell me, tell me, tell
me! No? No? No. I can't.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.534
Why not?
You're biased.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.194
I'm not.
I know who you're rooting for.

33:59.270 --> 34:02.137
No, you don't. I do. And I
don't want to argue about it.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.800
Tell me. Who gets him?
You'll find out tonight at 6:00.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.545
Hi!

34:09.614 --> 34:12.913
Martin Joseph Elroy, I told you
never to bother me here at work.

34:12.984 --> 34:15.918
You did? I mean,
I- I know that. I know that.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.888
But I came by
to ask you out on a date.

34:18.956 --> 34:22.619
What's your angle?
I don't have an angle.

34:22.693 --> 34:27.255
I've just been rotten to you and the
kids, but I think I can change all that.

34:27.331 --> 34:31.199
That is, if you meet me for dinner
in the dining room at 6:00.

34:31.268 --> 34:33.260
Here at the hotel?
Yeah.

34:33.337 --> 34:36.601
Who's paying? Well, don't
- don't worry about that.

34:36.674 --> 34:39.404
But that only gives me an hour
to go home and change.

34:39.476 --> 34:41.775
Just promise me
that you'll be there?

34:41.846 --> 34:43.837
Okay.
Okay.

34:52.389 --> 34:57.020
<i>Well, will you look at this, Gus?
What a model citizen.</i>

34:58.463 --> 35:01.955
Keep America beautiful.
See ya later, guys.

35:12.910 --> 35:15.504
<i>Don't I have a few more hours?
Wasn't that the deal?</i>

35:15.580 --> 35:19.539
Come on, Marty. You're three days overdue
now. Last night I gave you some grace period.

35:19.617 --> 35:23.678
You know me. I'm a soft-hearted,
easy-going kind of guy.

35:23.754 --> 35:26.951
- Yeah.
- Hey, I gotta share this with ya.

35:27.024 --> 35:31.017
Last night, after our last conversation, bought a set of oil paints
- you know, with the numbers?

35:31.095 --> 35:34.394
<i>You think I got a chance at being
an artist? What do ya think? Well-</i>

35:34.465 --> 35:36.797
Like a snowball in hell,
he's got a chance.

35:36.868 --> 35:40.304
I think that, you know, van Gogh
never painted a picture till he was 30.

35:40.371 --> 35:43.704
Is that a fact? Hear that, Gus?
Get me a scotch.

35:43.774 --> 35:47.335
Yeah.
Where's the money, Marty?

35:47.411 --> 35:50.710
Well, I- I gotta make
a phone call.

35:50.781 --> 35:55.013
About the money?
Of course. For the money.

35:56.387 --> 35:58.378
I'll just-
Phone call?

36:01.058 --> 36:06.621
Yeah, operator. Yeah.
Get me, uh, Klondike-7-55- uh, 55.

36:06.697 --> 36:09.393
Who are you callin'?

36:09.467 --> 36:12.925
- Hello. Big Al?
- Oh, good idea!

36:13.004 --> 36:17.566
- I need a little help here.
- Yeah. No Shinola, Sherlock! What happened to your secret plan?

36:17.642 --> 36:21.339
It's gonna be a disaster if I don't
get out of here within a half hour.

36:21.412 --> 36:23.812
- Yeah. You're cutting it pretty thin.
- Yeah. Well-

36:23.881 --> 36:25.872
<i>And that starts next week.</i>

36:25.950 --> 36:30.250
You know, Big Al, I was just wondering-
I wonder who's gonna win this race.

36:30.321 --> 36:32.789
Sam, this is no time
to be talking about gambling.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.950
Oh, I'm not talking
about gambling.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.894
It's a good thing, because Ziggy says we can
never, never, never, never, never, ever...

36:38.963 --> 36:42.057
<i>use information from the future
for personal gain, and that's a rule.</i>

36:42.133 --> 36:44.533
Well, what idiot made
up that rule? You did!

36:44.602 --> 36:47.400
I tried to talk you out of it,
but no!

36:47.471 --> 36:51.908
<i>You said it had to be a firmly
embedded command. Uh-oh.</i>

36:51.976 --> 36:54.308
What? One of your
kids is running away.

36:54.378 --> 36:57.541
Which one? Jessica. She's packing
her bags. She's gonna hit the streets.

36:57.615 --> 37:00.140
Listen, uh-
Listen, I-I got a crisis here, okay?

37:00.218 --> 37:03.381
Um, one of my kids is running away
from home, so if you could exc-

37:03.454 --> 37:06.321
Never mind. Al? Listen to me.
You gotta go after her, okay?

37:06.390 --> 37:08.449
Because, remember,
she can see you, so-

37:08.526 --> 37:10.517
What about these gorillas?
I'll have to take my chances.

37:10.595 --> 37:14.190
I'm gonna talk to Dr. Beeks and see if she
can't get Ziggy to break the rule just once.

37:14.265 --> 37:16.392
No! No! No!
There's not enough time! Just go!

37:16.467 --> 37:19.459
Okay. I hope Marty's
insurance is paid up.

37:19.537 --> 37:23.098
<i>Finally, there is Lead Balloon.
Okay, I'll see ya, Big Al.</i>

37:23.174 --> 37:25.108
Did you get the money, Marty?

37:25.176 --> 37:28.145
Well, not exactly-yet.

37:28.212 --> 37:32.649
But I'll-I'll have it though,
right after this race.

37:32.717 --> 37:37.120
<i>On the rail is Jill's Vision,
followed by Bear in the Woods...</i>

37:37.188 --> 37:40.021
<i>and Polish War Hero...</i>

37:40.091 --> 37:43.322
<i>and the 40-to-1 shot,
Lead Balloon.!</i>

37:44.528 --> 37:47.588
Forty-one, two, three,
four, five, six.

37:47.665 --> 37:50.498
46.50.
Two thousand divided by 50 is 40!

37:50.568 --> 37:54.527
Will you lend me 350 and put
a bet down on the 40-to-1 shot?

37:54.605 --> 37:56.596
On Lead Balloon?
Yeah.

37:56.674 --> 37:59.370
That nag'll come in dead last,
and you're dead broke. Hey!

37:59.443 --> 38:02.378
<i>- Boy, a pool ofhumor today.
- Yeah, you are!</i>

38:02.446 --> 38:05.313
But you know? What's another
50 on top of the 2,000? Right?

38:05.383 --> 38:10.082
Because if it pays off at 40-to-1, I get
$2,000. I pay you and then we're even.

38:10.154 --> 38:13.123
What do you say? Oh, come on.
Hey! No! No, no, no, no, no!

38:13.190 --> 38:17.752
Show me that sensitive,
artistic soul.

38:21.966 --> 38:26.860
Okay, Marty.

38:29.607 --> 38:33.043
<i>Your mommy'll be very sad
if you run away, Jessica.</i>

38:33.110 --> 38:36.273
Do you know why?
No. Why?

38:36.347 --> 38:40.408
Because you have a smile
that's worth a million bucks!

38:40.484 --> 38:43.817
So you can't go away,
or you'll take all that away from her.

38:45.523 --> 38:49.152
Are you coming home with us, Al?
No, I don't think so, sweetheart.

38:49.226 --> 38:53.253
You could be my daddy.
I don't really have a daddy.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.562
Well, I didn't have a daddy either.
Or a mommy.

38:56.634 --> 39:00.536
Did that make you feel sad?
Oh. Oh, very sad.

39:00.604 --> 39:04.005
I used to think about what it
would be like to have a mommy.

39:04.075 --> 39:08.011
Someone who loved me
and who'd take care of me...

39:08.079 --> 39:11.879
and sang me to sleep and hugged me
and told me everything was okay.

39:11.949 --> 39:13.883
That's what my mommy does!

39:13.951 --> 39:16.283
She does, huh?
Why do you suppose she does that?

39:17.355 --> 39:19.687
Because she loves you
more than anything.

39:24.862 --> 39:28.855
Will I see you again, Al? I don't
know. You don't need me, honey.

39:28.933 --> 39:30.924
But you need your mommy...

39:31.001 --> 39:34.459
and, most important,
your mommy needs you.

39:35.573 --> 39:39.270
So, you gonna promise me
you're gonna take care of her?

39:39.343 --> 39:42.107
I promise. Will ya?
And you won't run away?

39:42.179 --> 39:44.170
No.
Okay.

39:44.248 --> 39:46.307
Bye, Al.
Bye, hon.

39:48.786 --> 39:52.779
And Lead Balloon, as expected,
is a long ways back.

39:52.857 --> 39:55.257
<i>As they straighten out
for the run down the backstretch,</i>

39:55.326 --> 39:59.194
<i>Bear in the Woods maintains the lead,
David's Honey is second. Gus. Do me a favor.</i>

39:59.263 --> 40:02.391
<i>Here comes Lead Balloon- I'm gonna
go get some fresh air while you, uh-</i>

40:02.466 --> 40:05.492
No, no, no, no, no! Wait! Wait! Wait!
It's not over yet. You never know.

40:05.569 --> 40:07.833
<i>And coming on toJack Hatch now,</i>

40:07.905 --> 40:11.841
there goes that 40-to-1 shot as the
field comes to the top of the stretch.

40:11.909 --> 40:14.002
- Bear in the Woods is still in front.
- Lead Balloon!

40:14.078 --> 40:16.342
<i>David's Honey, but here comes Lead
Balloon.! Come on, Lead Balloon! Come on!</i>

40:16.414 --> 40:20.111
It's Bear in the stretch, and Lead
Balloon has suddenly charged to the front.

40:20.184 --> 40:22.550
He's pulling away.
What a tremendous effort!

40:22.620 --> 40:26.420
Lead Balloon! All right! He
did it! He did it! He did it!

40:26.490 --> 40:29.687
Lead Balloon! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
I don't believe it! He did it!

40:29.760 --> 40:31.694
Lead Balloon!

40:31.762 --> 40:35.095
<i>If there was one horse we couldn't figure
in the feature, it was Lead Balloon.</i>

40:35.166 --> 40:37.259
Drinks for everybody!

40:37.334 --> 40:42.294
Oh, Sam, it's gonna be Lead Balloon
by a nose. We talked Ziggy in-

40:42.373 --> 40:45.467
Here he is in the winner's circle now.

40:45.543 --> 40:47.977
The race is over.
Yeah.

40:48.045 --> 40:50.843
And are your thumbs okay?
They're okay? You made a bet! Yes.

40:50.915 --> 40:52.849
And you won!
Yes.

40:52.917 --> 40:56.216
In our eighth race,
it's Lead Balloon!

40:56.287 --> 40:59.552
Okay, you paid off the bookie.
Jessica's fine.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.648
You got here
with two minutes to spare.

41:01.725 --> 41:05.559
So all you have to do
is choose a wife already!

41:05.629 --> 41:08.223
No problem.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.233
<i>Martin.</i>

41:10.301 --> 41:12.428
- Ellen!
- Marty!

41:12.503 --> 41:14.801
<i>Rachel?</i>

41:14.872 --> 41:17.363
What's she doing here?
Uh, excuse me.

41:17.441 --> 41:19.773
Uh, Rachel.
E- Excuse me!

41:19.844 --> 41:23.177
Rachel. I think you've mistaken
my husband for someone else.

41:23.247 --> 41:25.875
<i>This is my husband!
Sam, what's goin' on?</i>

41:25.950 --> 41:28.885
Martin, is this one of your silly
little jokey-wokeys?

41:28.953 --> 41:33.083
It better be a jokey-wokey.
This is no jokey-wokey-joke!

41:33.157 --> 41:35.421
I decided honesty would be
the best policy.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.484
For Boy Scouts,
not for bigamists!

41:37.561 --> 41:41.156
Now, ladies, I think it's time
you both know something.

41:41.232 --> 41:44.599
I... am-

41:44.668 --> 41:47.262
Sam! Sam!
A bigamist.

41:48.839 --> 41:51.239
Stop it, will ya?

41:51.308 --> 41:53.833
First I married you,
and then I married you.

41:53.911 --> 41:55.936
Will you cut it out!

41:56.013 --> 41:59.073
Let's stop horsin' around
and grab a bite. I'm starving.

41:59.149 --> 42:03.176
Rachel. I'm the father
of your two children.

42:04.421 --> 42:07.117
Ellen, I'm the father
of your two children.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.853
Will you change the subject,
for cryin' out loud?

42:09.927 --> 42:12.828
Could we go home now, please?
I have two homes.

42:12.897 --> 42:16.492
I have a home here with you
and a home with you in Brooklyn.

42:16.567 --> 42:20.503
Now, I'm not tellin' any more lies.
I brought you two together on purpose.

42:20.571 --> 42:23.904
On purpose? You brought them togeth
- This was your plan?

42:23.974 --> 42:27.933
I'm a lowlife, so go ahead-

42:28.012 --> 42:30.207
let me have it.

42:30.281 --> 42:32.272
You hussy!

42:32.349 --> 42:34.977
<i>You home wrecker!
He's my husband!</i>

42:35.052 --> 42:36.747
<i>He's my husband!
He's mine!</i>

42:36.820 --> 42:39.755
He's mine! Driver's license
- Ellen Louise Elroy.

42:39.823 --> 42:41.757
Rachel Thelma Elroy.
Married!

42:41.825 --> 42:43.759
Married!
Father David Murphy.

42:43.827 --> 42:45.988
- Rabbi Barry Goldstein.
- That's enough!

42:47.331 --> 42:51.290
It's not her fault.
And it's not her fault.

42:51.368 --> 42:53.461
I'm the one
who married both of you.

42:55.372 --> 42:58.773
- She didn't know you were already married?
- No. I never told her.

42:58.842 --> 43:01.572
You hocked my silver candlesticks
from Great Grandma Sara...

43:01.645 --> 43:03.738
so you could spend money on her?

43:03.814 --> 43:06.112
I didn't spend it on her.

43:06.183 --> 43:08.674
I lost it at the track, I think.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.686
You can bet on it.

43:10.754 --> 43:13.746
You know what?
I believe you.

43:13.824 --> 43:17.123
He steals my children's allowance
and spends it on horse races.

43:17.194 --> 43:20.186
And then he sends them to school
with lunch in a barf bag!

43:20.264 --> 43:24.928
I'm sure that neither one of you have been happy
one day with good old Marty since you married him.

43:25.002 --> 43:29.939
- What are you saying, Sam?
- Well, I've always been worried about something.

43:30.007 --> 43:32.635
I'm always worried we're not
going to be able to make rent.

43:32.710 --> 43:35.645
I am constantly worried
we're going to lose the house.

43:35.713 --> 43:37.704
Really? Oh, they're
bonding. That's bad.

43:37.781 --> 43:41.774
I cannot tell you how many sleepless nights I've
spent wondering when the bank was going to foreclose.

43:41.852 --> 43:44.184
Sam, the train is going
in the wrong direction.

43:44.254 --> 43:46.245
No, it's going in exactly
the right direction.

43:46.323 --> 43:49.724
You know what? I think he's been
taking advantage of both of us.

43:49.793 --> 43:52.387
<i>- I know he has.
- Of course, he has.</i>

43:54.398 --> 43:56.389
- Marty?
- Hmm?

43:56.467 --> 44:00.233
I know this is going to come as a
shock to you, but I'm leaving you.

44:00.304 --> 44:03.102
Ellen gets him! I knew it! I
knew it! Ellen, he's all yours.

44:03.173 --> 44:06.006
Oh, no. I'm going home and
changing the locks. He's yours.

44:06.076 --> 44:08.544
Oh, I knew Rachel gets him.
I don't want him!

44:08.612 --> 44:11.547
Well, neither do I! Now you've
blown it for both of them!

44:11.615 --> 44:15.073
Do something, Sam!
I think I just did.

44:15.152 --> 44:17.518
I guess we're both
leaving you, Martin.

44:17.588 --> 44:19.715
I guess I deserve it.

44:19.790 --> 44:21.951
Sam, this is incredible!
You're changing history.

44:22.026 --> 44:24.586
Rachel marries a doctor,
and her kids graduate from college.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.892
- What about Ellen?
- I agree with Rachel.

44:26.964 --> 44:29.899
We've let you get away
with murder.

44:29.967 --> 44:34.768
Uh, Ellen
- She becomes a marriage counselor and she remarries, and her kids are fine too.

44:34.838 --> 44:37.238
And, oh, get this. Get this!

44:37.307 --> 44:41.767
Marty cleans up his act and makes a bundle on
the lecture circuit talking about his story.

44:41.845 --> 44:45.008
<i>And-And you know what?
It has got to stop.</i>

44:45.082 --> 44:48.051
You're right.
It has to stop.

44:54.124 --> 44:56.058
Good-bye, Martin.

44:57.094 --> 44:59.085
See ya, Marty.

44:59.163 --> 45:03.361
Would you like to come to my house for a
cup of coffee, and we could talk about this?

45:03.434 --> 45:05.368
I'd love to.
Great.

45:05.436 --> 45:07.370
You know something?
Yes!

45:07.438 --> 45:09.929
You know somethin'? I
don't believe it. What?

45:10.007 --> 45:14.569
You figured out that you leapt in
to blow Marty's scam,

45:14.645 --> 45:16.738
and you didn't tell me.

45:16.814 --> 45:21.251
You knew! You knew, Sam!
You knew it! You didn't tell me!

45:21.318 --> 45:23.411
<i>Would you have listened to me?
Marty.!</i>

45:23.487 --> 45:25.421
<i>Daddy.!
Oh, Marty.!</i>

45:25.489 --> 45:27.047
Surprise!

45:28.992 --> 45:31.927
<i>Hi, Daddy.!</i>

45:31.995 --> 45:34.463
Oh, boy!

45:42.039 --> 45:45.497
<i>All right.! All right.!
Listen- Listen to me.!</i>

45:45.576 --> 45:50.013
We are here tonight, not because
we want more rights than men have,

45:50.080 --> 45:53.743
<i>but because we want
the same rights men have.</i>

45:53.817 --> 45:57.412
<i>- I'm asking you to burn it.!
- Do it! Just do it!</i>

45:57.488 --> 46:01.117
<i>Burn it for liberation.!
Burn it now.!</i>

46:01.191 --> 46:04.627
<i>Liberation now.!</i>

46:04.695 --> 46:07.493
Liberation now!
Oh, boy.

46:08.499 --> 46:12.458
<i>Liberation now.!
Liberation now.!</i>
