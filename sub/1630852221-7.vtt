WEBVTT

00:45.560 --> 00:47.799
Move it, Enzo! We gotta go!

01:25.319 --> 01:28.079
They left him here for us
half an hour ago.

01:37.840 --> 01:41.079
Ciro Di Marzio's allied
with the Gentleman's widow.

01:41.159 --> 01:45.719
After the shipment got ripped off under
our noses, that's just what we needed.

01:45.799 --> 01:47.439
What do we do, Don Genna'?

01:53.239 --> 01:59.519
GOMORRA

02:08.120 --> 02:10.560
Well, have you spoken to the broker?

02:12.560 --> 02:15.960
I need it right away,
I don't have time to lose, got it?

02:16.479 --> 02:17.919
All right?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.879
I'll see it arrives tomorrow.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.919
Whaddaya think about Gennaro?

02:26.280 --> 02:29.199
I think he's heading for the shitheap
and you know it too.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.360
He's losing.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.520
Smile in front of him,
and forget that crap.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.520
Fuck it, I turned the world upside down
to find a new broker.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.639
He's Slovenian, but we gotta hurry.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.039
- Is it a done deal?
- There's one thing missing.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.520
In the morning, you gotta go
to Trieste to meet him.

02:56.120 --> 03:00.280
The son a bitch wants twice the advance
and the rest on departure,

03:00.360 --> 03:02.479
not on delivery as usual.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.360
I didn't have any choice.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.840
Negotiate with him and tell him
the money's not an issue,

03:08.919 --> 03:11.120
but we need it sooner.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.439
It's a tricky moment,
the turf bosses are getting antsy.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.039
If the stuff gets here fast
they'll be happy.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.919
No one'll notice a thing
and we repair the damage.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.000
Got it?

03:54.199 --> 03:57.599
They started prepping it all,
they're just waiting for us.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.360
What about Gennaro?

03:59.439 --> 04:01.960
Gennaro's falling to bits.

04:02.039 --> 04:05.400
With no money and no drugs
his men will leave him.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.840
But we need to keep our people close,

04:08.919 --> 04:12.919
the spots gotta reopen now and
everyone's gotta know it's only the start.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.199
Anyway, we're getting the widow's stuff.

04:16.879 --> 04:18.560
We're ready.

04:18.639 --> 04:21.759
I wanna feel the knife
sinking into his flesh.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.079
You're up already? It's six.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.800
Where were you?

04:51.560 --> 04:53.720
- I had a problem.
- What problem?

04:57.879 --> 04:59.360
Nothing I can't solve.

04:59.439 --> 05:01.439
Doesn't look like you're solving it.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.560
I'm tired, Azzurra.

05:07.759 --> 05:09.920
I knew I shouldn't have come here.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.879
But when I protected you
from your father I suited you.

05:15.959 --> 05:17.839
I suited you fine back then.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.959
That was something else,

05:22.079 --> 05:23.759
now it's different.

05:26.439 --> 05:30.360
Now I can't wait to take my son
and get away from you.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.120
You're hurting me.

05:35.199 --> 05:36.759
Don't joke.

05:37.519 --> 05:39.639
You don't know what I'm capable of.

05:57.639 --> 05:59.639
Blue Blood's coming!

06:07.639 --> 06:09.680
Guys, we gotta go!

06:09.759 --> 06:12.000
We gotta be operational by tonight.

06:17.079 --> 06:19.519
This stuff's gotta fly.

06:21.680 --> 06:22.720
Hey.

06:24.439 --> 06:26.519
Ciro's here too.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.759
This is Gullet,
he helped us open up this turf.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.839
- It's a pleasure to meet you in person.
- Pleasure's mine.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.519
These are all his guys that work for us.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.399
Guys!

06:56.480 --> 06:58.040
The Immortal.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.480
Look up.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.920
The time's come to lift our heads.

07:11.879 --> 07:14.639
Do you feel how important
this moment is?

07:16.399 --> 07:19.199
We gotta regain control
of our home turf.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.720
And I'll make a promise to you all.

07:22.959 --> 07:26.120
However it goes down, I'm with you.

08:27.639 --> 08:29.439
How did it go?

08:29.519 --> 08:32.279
I gave him the advance
like you ordered.

08:32.879 --> 08:35.440
- But?
- The Slovenian got the situation.

08:36.759 --> 08:40.639
He wants the rest now,
not when the shipment leaves,

08:40.720 --> 08:43.120
or the shipment's won't leave at all.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.399
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Don Gennaro.

09:24.039 --> 09:27.039
Do you realize what you're asking me?

09:32.080 --> 09:35.120
I know, I had a small setback.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.039
This wasn't the deal.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.799
The two million you're asking for
is twice what you gave me.

09:40.879 --> 09:43.559
In six months you'll get three back.

09:43.639 --> 09:45.679
Know of a more generous bank?

10:15.360 --> 10:18.399
With so little notice, it's not easy.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.080
I know you'll find a solution, right?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.759
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

10:47.919 --> 10:49.879
All settled?

10:49.960 --> 10:52.120
Gennaro's taking care of it now,

10:52.200 --> 10:54.960
we have a new connection,
we just gotta pay him.

10:55.039 --> 10:57.279
We're asking Gennaro's
businessmen for cash.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.039
When does the shipment arrive?

11:00.120 --> 11:04.080
The Gentleman's cocaine's running out,
the dealers aren't happy.

11:04.159 --> 11:08.000
They'll be fine as long as
they don't have bad thoughts.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.919
Bad thoughts are like knives in the back,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.240
so, lose the knives, we have no choice.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.080
We do and you know it.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.399
Others see it the same way I do.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.399
Gennaro's losing it.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.200
and if the Immortal's with the widow,
it's a big problem.

11:24.279 --> 11:26.080
I gave Gennaro my word.

11:29.279 --> 11:31.679
He gave us his, too.

11:31.759 --> 11:36.080
He told us we'd grow,
that we'd run things together

11:36.159 --> 11:39.960
but now he's obsessed with Ciro
and the problems with his wife.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.919
We can't afford to fight a war
on the wrong side.

11:53.759 --> 11:55.679
Say that again, Luciana...

11:58.879 --> 12:00.759
If you can't see it,

12:01.600 --> 12:03.639
I have to open your eyes.

12:07.879 --> 12:09.799
I got stuff to do.

13:48.159 --> 13:51.919
Why is the wife of the shitbag
who killed my husband here

13:52.000 --> 13:53.879
to sell me her allies?

13:56.399 --> 13:59.080
You must be really desperate.

14:01.759 --> 14:03.440
That's right.

14:05.519 --> 14:07.679
Does Mistral know you're here?

14:20.440 --> 14:22.399
He'll see reason,

14:22.480 --> 14:24.519
like I did.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.519
Gennaro Savastano's
gonna lose this war.

14:30.159 --> 14:31.639
How do you know?

14:35.440 --> 14:39.000
I saw the fear in his eyes
every time you attacked him.

14:40.279 --> 14:43.759
This is war, Luciana,
words aren't enough.

14:45.039 --> 14:48.639
If you wanna win, your allies
gotta help you earn money,

14:48.720 --> 14:51.039
gotta help you kill men.

14:57.399 --> 14:59.159
Gennaro's desperate,

15:00.080 --> 15:03.840
he's asking everyone for money
to buy another shipment.

15:03.919 --> 15:05.399
From who?

15:06.519 --> 15:09.200
His businessman pals,

15:09.279 --> 15:12.600
the ones he financed
to get them on his side.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.519
Do you know who they are?

15:19.039 --> 15:20.840
I can find out...

15:22.080 --> 15:24.039
if we come to an agreement.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.840
I want the names.

15:28.919 --> 15:31.879
And then I'll consider it.

15:39.759 --> 15:41.759
I'll let you live,

15:43.200 --> 15:46.320
take it as a good-will gesture.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.399
Yo, man.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.120
You know how to count, right?

16:10.519 --> 16:11.879
Guys.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.240
Ciro?

16:35.320 --> 16:38.200
He was on up Vesuvius,
he's on his way back.

16:38.279 --> 16:39.919
There he is.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
There's not many people coming.

16:42.080 --> 16:46.399
But it's good stuff and thanks to Gennaro
the price is low, they'll line up.

16:46.480 --> 16:50.279
- Heard from Pure'n'Simple?
- The La SanitÃ  spots open tomorrow.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.960
I reckon we brought home
something good.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.640
I was wrong to say what I did.

17:14.559 --> 17:16.759
It's just that I'm worried.

17:19.559 --> 17:21.799
There's no reason to be.

17:22.559 --> 17:26.400
We already paid for the shipment in
advance, we just need the rest,

17:26.480 --> 17:28.680
Gennaro's organized.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.680
The businessmen again?

17:37.279 --> 17:39.400
Shouldn't we avoid squeezing them?

17:39.480 --> 17:41.359
What the fuck can they do?

17:41.440 --> 17:45.960
It's a six-month loan with interest,
like buying government bonds.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.559
Is that what Gennaro says?

18:00.000 --> 18:03.279
And who bought these bonds
in our neighborhood?

18:06.599 --> 18:08.720
Don Paolo, from the paper mill.

18:17.519 --> 18:18.559
And in Secondigliano?

18:20.079 --> 18:21.759
Other people.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.799
Will you let me eat now?

18:30.880 --> 18:32.039
All right,

18:33.359 --> 18:35.640
my mind's easier now.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.359
4:30pm's fine.

18:56.039 --> 18:57.440
Thank you.

19:04.079 --> 19:05.559
It's him.

19:08.119 --> 19:10.400
- Who are you?
- Sit down.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.279
Are you Don Paolo?

19:14.359 --> 19:16.400
Then we're your salvation.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.559
It's 500 thousand from Ciro Di Marzio.

19:21.640 --> 19:24.720
And there's another 500,
on one condition.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.920
Don't give Gennaro Savastano
the money he asked for.

19:29.839 --> 19:32.079
- How do you know that?
- We know everything.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.839
There's a war on out there.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.960
We're winning and Gennaro's losing.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.480
What side are you on?

20:08.160 --> 20:09.759
Good morning, Mr. Savastano.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.119
Unfortunately,
the cavaliere's not here.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.039
But he knew I was coming by?

20:18.119 --> 20:20.160
Yes, he left something for you.

20:27.839 --> 20:30.960
What he was supposed
to give us should be in a bag.

20:39.480 --> 20:42.039
It's 100 thousand, maybe a bit less.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.839
It's not a problem,

20:56.119 --> 20:58.880
give my regards to the cavaliere.

21:14.319 --> 21:15.279
He just left.

21:24.319 --> 21:26.039
This is the rest of your money.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.279
You made the right choice.

21:29.759 --> 21:33.599
And what happens
when Gennaro comes after me?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.319
Have you ever had a guardian angel?

21:36.400 --> 21:39.319
Now you have three, all our guys.

21:39.400 --> 21:43.519
If you stay at home, they'll be with you,
if you go out, they'll be behind you.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.039
And if you have any problems...

21:50.319 --> 21:52.480
they'll kill the problem for you.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.119
Good evening.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.319
Did you bring what we said?

22:35.160 --> 22:38.160
- Will you tell me why?
- The deal isn't closed yet.

22:38.759 --> 22:40.079
But I gave you a name.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.640
One name's not much
for all that money.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.400
Is one name enough for us?

22:47.440 --> 22:49.279
We want all the names.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.519
I risk too much that way.

22:57.279 --> 23:00.480
I don't know you, but I know people.

23:02.039 --> 23:04.920
I saw at once
you're a smart woman, or not?

23:05.680 --> 23:07.440
You know very well,

23:08.119 --> 23:12.319
in a stormy sea you can't stop,
although the current pulls you.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.440
That's the time to take a risk.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.640
But to stay in the middle,
on one side or the other...

23:19.759 --> 23:22.440
is the most dangerous position.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.960
Do a nice drawing, then show it to me.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.319
You look tired.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.680
I can't take it anymore.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.440
I know what you think.

24:09.119 --> 24:11.079
Your husband's in trouble

24:12.279 --> 24:14.119
and so's mine, Azzu'.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.799
You know it

24:19.000 --> 24:20.799
and you're afraid.

24:24.759 --> 24:28.160
It's the first time I've had this feeling
since I met him.

24:31.119 --> 24:34.200
If Gennaro loses this war,
you know what'll happen.

24:35.559 --> 24:38.799
The one who loses the war
can't defend his castle

24:39.720 --> 24:41.920
or what's inside it.

24:45.559 --> 24:47.960
There might be a way to sort it out.

24:50.759 --> 24:52.680
But it depends on you.

25:00.640 --> 25:03.119
Are you asking me
to betray my husband?

25:07.480 --> 25:08.920
Azzu'...

25:09.519 --> 25:12.599
for once, put yourself first.

25:45.759 --> 25:47.279
You're back.

25:49.079 --> 25:50.960
What have you been up to?

25:51.039 --> 25:53.759
I spent the afternoon with Luciana.

25:53.839 --> 25:56.920
She gave Pietro a gift,
he was very happy.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.720
I wanted to see how it's going
with my own eyes.

26:57.799 --> 27:00.759
It's not easy to construct a building,
but the foundations are solid.

27:00.839 --> 27:04.839
One step at a time, Gennaro knows
we're moving in on him.

27:05.359 --> 27:08.519
You have to swear
you'll get revenge for me.

27:08.599 --> 27:10.480
I already swore I would.

27:10.559 --> 27:13.680
- Did Donna Luciana call?
- She'll give us the names tonight.

27:13.759 --> 27:16.839
But she wants the money right away
and a safe place for the handover.

27:16.920 --> 27:20.799
She's afraid after she hands over
the list, her days will be numbered.

27:22.839 --> 27:25.119
She might be right.

27:27.799 --> 27:30.240
Don't worry, it's money well spent.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.799
Come for dinner at my place,
we gotta celebrate.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.839
We gotta talk about the future.

27:51.160 --> 27:53.240
Here are all the names.

27:57.599 --> 27:59.880
How did you do it?

27:59.960 --> 28:03.119
I already knew some
when I worked at the consortium.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.000
The others I saw among his papers.

28:08.960 --> 28:11.000
I know it was difficult.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.440
Azzu', listen to me.

28:16.119 --> 28:19.680
It's the only thing you could do
to protect your son.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.480
He's the most important thing.

28:36.119 --> 28:37.960
Wait for me here.

29:31.720 --> 29:34.240
- Good evening, Donna Luciana.
- I was expecting Ciro.

29:35.279 --> 29:37.519
It's the same if you talk to me.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.400
Are you Blue Blood?

29:41.599 --> 29:43.480
That used to be my name.

29:48.319 --> 29:50.279
Can I ask you something?

29:53.279 --> 29:58.359
A guy disappears, everyone says he's
dead, and after a while he comes back.

29:58.440 --> 30:03.519
He's got no house, no turf, no family,
but everyone comes back to him,

30:06.000 --> 30:07.480
the Immortal.

30:10.559 --> 30:11.960
What's so special about him?

30:15.559 --> 30:18.559
If you're wondering that,
one day you'll come over to his side.

30:42.599 --> 30:44.559
It's nearly ready.

31:12.319 --> 31:13.680
Let's go.

31:14.200 --> 31:15.480
Ronni!

31:16.720 --> 31:19.359
Piece of shit!
Get your hands off me!

31:22.960 --> 31:24.039
You're coming with us.

32:41.599 --> 32:42.519
Azzu'.

32:48.680 --> 32:49.839
Well?

32:50.319 --> 32:53.119
All good, Blue Blood gave us
what we asked for.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.839
You're an intelligent woman,

32:58.720 --> 32:59.960
but there's a problem.

33:00.599 --> 33:02.359
You're not a mother.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.119
What is it?

33:06.359 --> 33:08.119
Because of Gennaro?

33:09.480 --> 33:10.799
You see, Luciana...

33:11.480 --> 33:13.920
a woman can hate her husband,

33:14.000 --> 33:17.359
but if he's the father of her kid,
she won't betray him.

33:27.640 --> 33:31.519
My husband said we got
the best view in the world here.

33:31.599 --> 33:34.039
Vesuvius shining under the sun.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.960
I can smell the fragrance of the land
without seeing it,

33:38.039 --> 33:40.240
I think of the day that's over.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.359
One day less in my life.

33:44.599 --> 33:47.240
This is no time to think of death.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.200
We're winning.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.359
But you oughta know that
better than me,

33:55.720 --> 33:58.119
when you lose someone
who's in your heart,

33:58.200 --> 34:00.119
only the thought of death
makes you go on.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.559
When my son died
I wanted to die with him.

34:09.840 --> 34:13.599
My husband didn't know
how to make me stop crying,

34:14.440 --> 34:17.199
so one day he took me into a church.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.639
That saved you?

34:20.599 --> 34:22.159
The martyrs.

34:24.519 --> 34:26.639
They saved me.

34:32.239 --> 34:33.880
I looked at them...

34:35.159 --> 34:37.920
and I smelled their odor and I thought...

34:39.119 --> 34:40.840
They're like me.

34:43.119 --> 34:45.440
Those who suffer
have only one treasure:

34:46.719 --> 34:48.559
their suffering.

34:50.599 --> 34:52.760
No one can take that away from us.

35:10.719 --> 35:13.519
You don't know how long
I've been waiting for this moment.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.840
But I do know.

35:24.519 --> 35:26.719
I shot Ciro because of you.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.880
You shot him, but he didn't die.

35:33.119 --> 35:34.920
You're wrong.

35:37.639 --> 35:40.519
The brother I knew died on that boat.

35:42.599 --> 35:44.360
And me with him.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.360
Do you feel better now?

36:11.119 --> 36:14.239
You're not hitting me,
you're hitting yourself.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.760
But you're the one who's bleeding.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.239
You can't do anything to me,

36:42.719 --> 36:45.159
because I'm immortal now too.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.440
I said it that night on the boat,

36:50.519 --> 36:52.599
me and him are brothers.

36:53.679 --> 36:56.440
And for me that's all that counts.

37:47.599 --> 37:48.960
- Good evening.
- Hi, babe.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.440
You're here?

38:42.519 --> 38:46.880
I'll stuff the 100 thousand euros
you gave me in your mouth, one by one.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.280
Pure'n'Simple...

40:46.320 --> 40:47.920
I don't think he'll wake up.

40:56.119 --> 40:58.320
The state he's in, it's better that way.

41:03.199 --> 41:05.239
Leave me alone with him.

42:34.599 --> 42:36.440
Enzo, can you hear me?

42:39.679 --> 42:41.679
I'm here with you.

42:43.920 --> 42:46.039
You don't need
to be afraid of anything now.

42:47.639 --> 42:49.199
It's over.

42:53.559 --> 42:55.480
Now you're free.

43:01.679 --> 43:03.800
This is your peace.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.360
Gennaro.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.440
Why are you here? What's going on?

44:42.679 --> 44:45.280
I brought your wife back.

44:47.039 --> 44:48.639
And this.

44:50.719 --> 44:54.320
A million euros
from Ciro Di Marzio, for her.

44:58.239 --> 45:01.119
It's a gift to sell us all out, Mistral.

45:11.440 --> 45:13.920
I wanted to kill her with my own hands,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.320
but then I realized it's not up to me.

45:23.159 --> 45:25.079
I'll take care of it.

46:11.920 --> 46:14.079
What the fuck have you done, Luciana?

46:14.159 --> 46:17.880
You know what this means?
That now you gotta die.

46:17.960 --> 46:20.440
- Angelo...
- Get in the car!

46:21.000 --> 46:22.480
Get out of my way!

47:37.480 --> 47:39.360
- May I?
- Come in.

47:41.280 --> 47:43.000
Here you are.

47:45.320 --> 47:46.880
Thank you very much.

47:57.440 --> 47:59.039
Thank you, Don Gaetano.

49:46.239 --> 49:48.599
Enzo didn't die just for me.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.719
He died for you too.

49:57.039 --> 49:59.360
From now on,
he'll always be here with us.

50:00.559 --> 50:03.159
From this sacrifice
a new world must be born.

50:06.280 --> 50:08.000
Our world.

50:10.320 --> 50:13.719
Those who want to be part of it
have to take a blood oath.

50:27.239 --> 50:29.199
Because his blood is my blood.

50:49.400 --> 50:52.280
My blood is the blood of the Immortal.

50:55.880 --> 50:57.760
Forever.

51:20.239 --> 51:23.159
My blood is the blood of the Immortal.

51:43.239 --> 51:45.719
My blood is the blood of the Immortal.

51:57.920 --> 52:00.320
Immortal, my blood is your blood.

52:37.320 --> 52:39.639
