WEBVTT

00:00.640 --> 00:02.560
I want to know what happened.

00:04.680 --> 00:06.320
These things mark us.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.920
Change the way we see the world.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.680
There are no known sources
of bioluminescence

00:11.720 --> 00:15.120
capable of creating a sustained glow
like the one we saw.

00:15.320 --> 00:18.840
"In all the years
I've been investigating pathogens,

00:18.880 --> 00:21.440
this is the most deadly ever discovered."

00:21.480 --> 00:24.080
You should put out a warning
against having

00:24.120 --> 00:26.360
any contact whatsoever,
with any water."

00:27.480 --> 00:30.120
You saw what they did!
Everything is dead!

00:30.720 --> 00:33.720
You really think
I'd let something like that happen?

00:34.040 --> 00:38.320
What about that sound?
Ever hear anything like that before?

00:38.480 --> 00:41.240
And I'm wondering
if anyone else picked up on it.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.080
I'm sorry, sir,
this is now a restricted area.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.800
-So it is Vibrio vulnificus?
-Yes.

04:17.960 --> 04:21.240
I've spoken to labs
in South Africa, Brazil and Japan.

04:21.480 --> 04:24.440
They're going to sequence the DNA
of the crabs which came ashore there.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.200
Once I get the results,
I'll compare it to the DNA

04:27.360 --> 04:29.640
in the crabs
that were sent from Morocco.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.440
What did they say?

04:31.600 --> 04:35.400
The shell color and absence of eyes
suggest they live under the surface,

04:35.560 --> 04:37.000
near thermal vents.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.160
Except vent crabs
cannot survive on land,

04:40.320 --> 04:43.280
which is why they think
it must be some kind of mutation.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.320
Or it's an entirely new species.

04:46.560 --> 04:50.560
And from the reports we've been seeing,
they seem to be spreading much faster.

04:50.720 --> 04:54.240
And killing people much quicker
than the infected lobsters.

04:57.400 --> 05:01.240
"And they will know that I am the Lord
when I stretch out my hand."

05:03.800 --> 05:05.040
Exodus.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.800
The plagues of Egypt.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.800
Bravo.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.560
Lobsters, crabs, jellyfish.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.800
A little different from the frogs
and locusts and flies in the Bible.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.920
Thankfully, no water turning to blood.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.400
Yet.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.200
I'm impressed,
the nuns did get through to you.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.960
No, they didn't.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.240
I lost whatever faith I had
by the time I graduated.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.480
But I remember the stories.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.440
The ones about the Wrath of God
in particular.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.560
Noah.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.440
Sodom and Gomorrah.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.520
The plagues.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.160
The thing about plagues...

05:55.640 --> 05:59.560
whether you believe they're sent by God
or not, is that they make you think.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.240
Did we bring them down on ourselves?

06:05.960 --> 06:07.640
Something to cause them?

06:11.320 --> 06:13.080
Even if you leave God out of it,

06:13.960 --> 06:16.440
I think it's a question worth asking.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.640
Charlie. Thanks for the message.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.720
Thirty.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.680
How did that happen?

06:40.840 --> 06:43.160
Wish you were here to soften the blow.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.000
We could relive
some of last year's madness.

06:47.680 --> 06:48.920
Maybe not.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.640
Considering.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.440
Maybe not.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.040
Considering.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.720
Considering.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.920
Damn it!

07:09.440 --> 07:10.680
Anyway,

07:11.480 --> 07:13.400
hope the reason you're not answering

07:13.560 --> 07:16.520
is because you're with
that hot guy from the boat.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.800
Miss you.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.480
Miss you.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.640
Miss you.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.160
Miss you.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.320
Miss you.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.080
Miss you.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.320
Miss you.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.960
Thank you for your call.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.560
I'm no longer working
at Hovedstad Energy.

08:51.720 --> 08:55.160
Please feel free to direct all inquiries
to Erika Skaugen

08:55.320 --> 08:58.480
at skaugen@hovedstadenergy.com.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.040
-You'll show her?
-Yes.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.600
-When?
-When I find the right moment.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.920
Rahim, it's important.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.400
So is keeping my head
attached to my shoulders.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.160
I have to go.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.240
-And this was where?
-The Nankai Trough.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.840
900 kilometers off the coast of Japan,
just south of Honshu.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.200
It's one of the areas
Mifune found the worms.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.560
Yes, it is.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.080
Thankfully, the slide was small,

09:39.240 --> 09:41.680
it barely registered
on the seismographs.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.240
Sorry.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.480
Kind of you to join us.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.160
To eat into the seabed that deeply,
that quickly,

09:50.320 --> 09:53.000
the rate of reproduction
of the worms and bacteria

09:53.240 --> 09:56.040
must have accelerated
at an unimaginable pace.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.760
Any area where they have been found
could be at risk.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.920
All the worms found to date
were found on continental slopes?

10:07.080 --> 10:08.680
As far as we know, yes.

10:09.280 --> 10:12.960
So, all near coastal areas
with high population density.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.360
If any one of these collapsed,

10:15.520 --> 10:18.320
the effect to the area
would be devastating.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.720
-What's your point?
-My point is that...

10:21.280 --> 10:22.280
The worms,

10:22.440 --> 10:26.440
they just happened to be found
where they would do the most harm.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.400
Well,

10:29.800 --> 10:32.280
I think that has more to do
with where we're looking

10:32.440 --> 10:34.800
rather than anything more sinister.

10:37.480 --> 10:41.840
Professor Lehmann.
There's something I need to show you.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.000
-I told her.
-And?

10:51.240 --> 10:53.040
She wants to speak to you.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.960
-Hey, do you want me to leave?
-It's okay, just...

11:01.880 --> 11:03.920
Charlie, this is Dr. Johanson.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.760
He's on secondment
from Trondheim University.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.400
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:08.640 --> 11:12.760
Rahim mentioned that you have something
you would like to share with us.

11:12.920 --> 11:13.920
We do, yes.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.960
And he declined
to elaborate on it without you.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.880
It'll be better to show you.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.680
I was looking into the night the Juno
and the other ships went down.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.120
If you would take a look at this.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.080
Let me bring it up on the monitor.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.560
Jess left me a message.

11:35.960 --> 11:39.880
There was a strange light and bursts
of sound before the Juno went down.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.560
Wish you were here to soften the blow.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.440
We could relive
some of last year's madness.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.320
Maybe not. Considering.

11:49.480 --> 11:53.000
I tried to amplify these bursts
by rescaling pitch and formants.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.160
Anyway,

11:54.760 --> 11:57.800
hope the reason you're not answering
is because

11:58.040 --> 12:00.360
you're with that hot guy from the boat.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.560
Miss you.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.160
And now if you take a look
at the footage

12:11.320 --> 12:13.720
the ROV picked up of the Juno
after it sank...

12:29.520 --> 12:31.360
...hot guy from the boat.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.400
I checked the wavelength of the light

12:34.560 --> 12:37.320
and the frequency of the sound:
they're identical.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.440
Charlie, we discussed this.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.240
It's probably some sort of spike.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.960
Some sort of glitch
from an interrupted comms signal.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.680
Professor Lehmann, please.
There's something else.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.240
Just hear me out.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.440
Go ahead.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.000
A few hours before the Juno
and the other two ships sank,

12:56.160 --> 12:59.160
I discovered there was a spike
in water temperature.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.120
-This is from the MetOp satellite?
-Yes.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.720
The spike in water temperature
tails off a couple of hours later.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.560
I think the sudden rise
in water temperature

13:09.720 --> 13:12.360
could have thawed
the hydrates on the seafloor,

13:12.520 --> 13:15.920
releasing methane and causing
a blowout, just like the Thorvaldson.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.600
Charlie, the blowout on the Thorvaldson
was caused by a release of methane

13:19.840 --> 13:21.400
from a section of the seabed

13:21.560 --> 13:24.280
destabilized by an infestation
of Sirsoe methanicola.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.200
I know that,
but just take a look at this.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.920
These are the waters
around the Shetlands.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.480
Underneath the blue mark
there's a hydrothermal vent.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.720
Charlie. I don't understand.

13:37.880 --> 13:41.440
-The vent's supposed to be dormant...
-It's not "supposed to be."

13:41.600 --> 13:42.960
It is dormant.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.720
-We don't know that.
-We do.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.280
I think it's become active.

13:46.440 --> 13:49.240
And the hydrothermal vent
near the mass of methane hydrates

13:49.400 --> 13:53.400
I found floating to the surface might
be active as well, and I could prove it.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.800
If I can borrow the Deepwater AUV,
I can get a camera down there just...

13:57.400 --> 13:58.440
Charlie.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.160
Enough.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.520
Even if the vent were active,

14:05.480 --> 14:09.720
the hot water it expelled would cool
before it got anywhere near the surface.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.320
And there is no force on Earth,
either man-made or natural,

14:13.560 --> 14:18.400
that could redirect that much water
all the way from the vent to the Juno.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.000
Secure the station and get back here.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.840
All I want to do is take a look.

14:25.080 --> 14:29.120
Two ships, one which almost went down
due to a sudden release of methane.

14:29.360 --> 14:33.480
The other which did, at the same time
there was a sudden rise in temperature.

14:33.720 --> 14:37.320
-There has to be some connection.
-I won't tell you again.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.640
She'll calm down.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.840
Was that your professor?

15:03.520 --> 15:04.640
Yes.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.840
Do you always talk to her like that?

15:12.880 --> 15:13.880
No.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.920
You don't even know
what we were talking about.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.600
You're right, I don't.

15:18.760 --> 15:22.360
So I don't think you're in any position
to criticize the way I talk to her.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.960
I don't need to know that
to know you crossed the line.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.760
-Sometimes it's good to listen...
-I listen.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.240
You don't listen.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.080
You fire off your own ideas,
one after the other, like gunshots.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.720
-All anyone can do is run for cover.
-You don't get it.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.920
Everything has to be
by the book with her,

15:43.080 --> 15:46.040
the way she did it,
the way her professors did it.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.880
I get it, there's a right way
and a wrong way to do things.

15:49.120 --> 15:53.080
But I won't reject a different way
of thinking because she doesn't like it.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.160
Charlie, think.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.240
You might be the smartest person
in the room,

16:03.400 --> 16:05.880
and most of the time you probably are.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.800
But that doesn't mean
the other people aren't smart too.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.600
-I don't mean it to sound like that.
-I know you don't.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.440
I know.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.680
And I'm sorry
if I've ever made you feel like that.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.240
Made me feel stupid?

16:30.480 --> 16:32.680
Never. Far too smart for that.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.440
I'm gonna head out.

16:43.640 --> 16:44.800
Why?

16:44.960 --> 16:47.720
You've a lot to do,
you've got to pack all this stuff up.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.480
I'll come back with Iona,

16:51.640 --> 16:53.360
help you with the last few things.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.000
Maybe one last MacInally
for the road, eh?

16:58.240 --> 16:59.240
Thanks.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.720
That wasn't like you.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.200
-No, it wasn't.
-No.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.600
I'm the one
who sent them out there, Sigur.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.440
All those bright young men and women.

17:58.480 --> 17:59.640
Katherina.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.960
It wasn't your fault.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Nobody could have predicted
what was gonna happen.

18:07.160 --> 18:10.040
-It was an accident.
-I know, Sigur. I know.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.520
But I still can't help
questioning myself...

18:16.120 --> 18:17.280
wonder...

18:20.400 --> 18:22.200
If I had delayed their trip,

18:22.360 --> 18:24.600
if I had sent them working
somewhere else...

18:27.360 --> 18:30.120
Charlie, Rahim,
I understand what they are doing,

18:32.320 --> 18:34.640
they need to do something
with their grief.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.480
So do you.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.320
I know.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.800
So...

18:54.760 --> 18:56.480
Tell me about Wagner.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.000
-Charlie?
-Yeah.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.880
She's like a foal kicking at its stall.

19:05.800 --> 19:10.040
You studied with her mother.
Here at the IMB. Ingrid Haugen.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.160
-She's Ingrid's daughter?
-Yeah.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.880
Yeah. Yeah, so that's where
she gets it from.

19:21.760 --> 19:22.920
But...

19:24.360 --> 19:27.240
I wouldn't be so quick
to dismiss what she said.

20:51.440 --> 20:52.920
Why are you still up?

20:53.680 --> 20:56.920
Not because I'm waiting up for you,
if that's why you're asking.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.400
I wasn't,
but thanks for letting me know.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.680
You sound tired.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.760
I always sound tired.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.240
Well, you know what,
I've been correcting papers.

21:08.840 --> 21:12.720
And this might come
as a shock to you, but apparently...

21:13.560 --> 21:15.920
Tokyo is in Vietnam.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.640
-What?
-Yeah, and Lima is in Canada.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.880
And if you want to know
the capital of Uganda...

21:23.040 --> 21:24.240
That's Egypt.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.840
Was this a test?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.520
Yeah, third grade, geography.

21:32.920 --> 21:35.360
I think they need a new teacher.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.800
Yeah, that,
and I probably need a new job.

21:41.760 --> 21:45.880
By the way, I reserved our court
for us on Saturday, at ten.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.600
And I was thinking
that maybe we could...

21:50.480 --> 21:53.840
grab lunch or a few drinks after.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.240
Sounds good.

22:01.920 --> 22:02.920
You okay?

22:06.240 --> 22:07.400
Can we talk later?

22:07.640 --> 22:09.120
I've got to finish up.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.280
Yeah, sure. What time will you be home?

22:13.640 --> 22:16.000
An hour, maybe two.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.120
Okay, okay.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.160
Well,
if you're gonna be like that, fine.

22:21.920 --> 22:25.720
Just so you know,
I will wait up for you, okay?

22:25.960 --> 22:26.960
Like...

22:27.920 --> 22:28.920
Really.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.400
I'll wait up for you.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.640
-Okay.
-Bye.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.640
Bye.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.960
The International Council
for the Protection of the Ocean

22:54.120 --> 22:57.120
has called for an urgent meeting
in Geneva, Switzerland.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.400
Hundreds of experts and delegates
are expected to join the proceedings

23:01.560 --> 23:04.560
with the five current member states
leading the summit.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.560
The ICPO is meeting in Geneva.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.320
Yes, they are.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.920
Yeah. Can you get me
a meeting with them?

23:12.160 --> 23:13.200
Can I ask why?

23:13.360 --> 23:15.720
The infestation of worms,
jellyfish, yeah?

23:15.880 --> 23:18.040
The infected lobsters and crabs.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.560
I just don't believe
that they can be occurring

23:20.720 --> 23:24.480
entirely independent from one another,
there must be some connection.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.000
It's interesting that you say this.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.760
Through Mr. Mifune's business interests,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.680
we came across a cetologist in Canada.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.000
He's found a new species of mussel,

23:36.160 --> 23:39.120
which is reproducing
at an unprecedented rate,

23:39.280 --> 23:40.880
causing havoc with shipping.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.400
Can I speak to him?

23:42.560 --> 23:46.480
Of course. I'll send him a note
and tell him to expect your call.

23:46.920 --> 23:50.040
I have to go to Trondheim
for a meeting at the University,

23:50.280 --> 23:52.240
but I can try him on the way back.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.400
And if you could try
to set something up with the ICPO.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.240
Of course.

23:57.840 --> 24:02.320
I'm traveling to Osaka, but I will
speak to them as soon as I return.

24:02.920 --> 24:06.520
Thank you. And safe travels, Riku.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.200
Thank you, Sigur.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.800
I shouldn't have to find out
from Dr. Coletti.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.720
When?

24:34.960 --> 24:36.600
When were you going to tell me?

24:36.760 --> 24:39.800
When it was too late for me
to do anything to help?

24:41.160 --> 24:43.240
Of course I'm coming. Of course.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.240
I'll be there by the end of the week.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.200
I love you, too.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.280
You okay?

25:04.040 --> 25:05.520
It was my mother.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.040
She has to have an operation.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.000
I'm sorry.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.840
She'll be fine.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.720
That's good.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.920
She never tells me what's going on.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.720
Doesn't want to bother me.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.240
But what bothers me
is not being able to help.

25:26.720 --> 25:27.840
You're going back?

25:29.160 --> 25:30.320
Yes.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.880
For how long?

25:34.800 --> 25:36.600
Depends how things go.

25:38.960 --> 25:41.640
You'll let me know
if you find anything out?

25:45.640 --> 25:48.280
If I can do anything to help
while I'm away, let me know.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.520
I will.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.160
Okay.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.760
-I'll see you before I go.
-Okay.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.880
-Hello.
-Leon Anawak?

27:01.040 --> 27:02.040
Yes.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.760
Hi, my name is Dr. Sigur Johanson.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.800
I got your details from Riku Sato.
Did he mention that I might call?

27:10.400 --> 27:11.400
Yes, he did.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.600
Can you talk for a moment?
I could always call back.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.960
No, it's fine. Now's good.

27:17.480 --> 27:20.280
See, I don't know
what Riku told you, but...

27:20.720 --> 27:24.000
we've discovered a new Sirsoe
methanicola in the North Atlantic,

27:24.720 --> 27:28.080
whose behavior and morphology
are both atypical.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.720
Riku said that you discovered
a new species of mussels

27:31.880 --> 27:34.840
whose behavior was unusual.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.520
Not just mussels.

27:37.680 --> 27:38.840
Whales.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.320
Whales?

27:41.480 --> 27:45.040
We found an organic substance in the
mussels and the brainstem of a whale.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.680
We ran a test and found 100 common
molecular compounds between them.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.000
In a mammal and a bivalve.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.160
I know.

27:52.320 --> 27:56.120
I can't explain either. You expect
some overlap, but nothing like this.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.560
And you think
that the substance is causing

27:58.720 --> 28:02.240
the changes in behavior
in both the mussels and the whale?

28:03.040 --> 28:04.360
We ran the test twice.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.160
I can't explain it.
I know it makes no sense, but...

28:08.040 --> 28:09.520
Nothing does right now.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.480
I can send you what we have,
so you can take a look.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.240
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.320
I just...

28:15.480 --> 28:18.960
can't help feeling that we're
in uncharted territory here.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.560
Feels strange, doesn't it?

28:23.360 --> 28:25.880
You in Europe, me in Canada.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.360
Somehow we're speaking
about the same thing.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.040
Completely different ways.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.120
Yeah, it does.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.480
I forgot how lovely it is here.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.240
Everything in its place.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.080
I didn't think you'd come.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.920
You said it was important.

30:15.680 --> 30:16.680
I...

30:19.160 --> 30:21.000
tried calling you at the office.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.160
You resigned.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.320
I did.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.480
They said
it would be different this time.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.560
I believed them.

30:38.040 --> 30:41.720
But people don't change,
no matter how much you want them to.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.360
I was wrong not to trust you.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.520
I was... to think that you would...

30:52.120 --> 30:53.520
lie to me.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.960
I could tell you why, I could try
to explain myself, it doesn't...

31:00.640 --> 31:02.440
Doesn't make it less wrong.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.120
I'm sorry.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.400
Tina, I am so sorry.

31:18.680 --> 31:21.400
-Let me get you something to drink.
-I can't stay.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.040
I'm going away, Sigur.

31:25.520 --> 31:26.520
Where?

31:27.240 --> 31:28.840
I haven't decided yet.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.000
For how long?

31:32.160 --> 31:33.560
I don't know.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.840
You're going by yourself?

31:44.280 --> 31:45.280
Yeah.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.640
I need some time.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.240
Will you let me know when you get back?

31:57.600 --> 31:59.000
Yeah, of course.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.560
-Sigur.
-I was afraid...

32:06.720 --> 32:09.480
-No. Sigur, please.
-No, no. Listen.

32:09.640 --> 32:11.560
I'm not gonna ask you to stay.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.680
I'm not gonna do that, I promise.

32:16.080 --> 32:17.560
I need you to know...

32:22.880 --> 32:26.160
I can't imagine a life without you.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.160
And...

32:32.200 --> 32:33.600
I don't want to.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.480
Goodbye, Sigur.

34:51.200 --> 34:54.040
I read the notes Leon Anawak sent
with the files.

34:55.240 --> 34:58.400
He hasn't been able to find
any known source of bioluminescence

34:58.560 --> 35:02.160
capable of creating a sustained glow
like the one that we're seeing.

35:02.320 --> 35:03.880
What about the sound?

35:04.800 --> 35:07.800
He's trying to find out
if anyone's picked it up before.

35:07.960 --> 35:08.960
But I checked.

35:09.120 --> 35:12.760
It's almost identical to the sound
we picked up when the Juno sank.

35:14.320 --> 35:18.000
Charlie thinks it's connected
to the sudden rise in water temperature,

35:18.240 --> 35:20.000
which caused the Juno to sink.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.360
-From the hydrothermal vent.
-Yes.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.560
Yeah.

35:24.200 --> 35:27.880
The supply helicopter's making a run
to the Shetlands today,

35:28.040 --> 35:31.400
so we could send the Deepwater AUV,

35:31.920 --> 35:34.600
get a camera down on the seabed,
see if the vent's active.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.280
Yeah, but there's a...

35:37.120 --> 35:40.680
There's a helipad at the airfield
in Værnes, in Trondheim.

35:40.840 --> 35:43.160
Do you think I could hitch a ride?

35:43.840 --> 35:45.360
I want to speak to Charlie.

35:47.960 --> 35:49.040
Fine.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.280
Hey.

36:51.280 --> 36:52.680
Dr. Johanson.

36:55.240 --> 36:56.400
Charlie Wagner.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.000
Yeah, we come bearing gifts.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.840
-The Deepwater.
-Yeah, where do you want it?

37:02.000 --> 37:04.440
-By the shed will be fine.
-Alright.

37:06.440 --> 37:07.720
-Hello.
-Hi.

37:11.600 --> 37:15.080
So, gentlemen, then we start
with the most important thing: beer.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.960
This is a surprise.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.800
I tried to call you.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.560
Is there somewhere we can talk?

37:34.080 --> 37:35.360
Sure.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.960
I just need to finish something
in the kitchen.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.440
Can you wait?
Shouldn't be more than 20 minutes.

37:42.680 --> 37:43.840
Okay.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.480
Have you spoken to him?

38:24.640 --> 38:26.600
To Leon Anawak? Yeah, I have.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.160
Does he have any idea what it is?

38:30.400 --> 38:31.400
None.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.560
None. He discovered it by accident,
just like you.

38:34.800 --> 38:38.440
He's checking to see if anyone picked up
the sound anywhere else in the ocean.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.640
And you need to check,
find out what's going on as well.

38:42.480 --> 38:45.400
So you can keep the Deepwater
as long as you need it.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.200
I promised Katherina I'd have
her helicopter back before night, so...

38:52.680 --> 38:54.160
Thank you for coming.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.560
And for helping me get to the truth.

38:58.360 --> 39:02.160
I don't know if Katherina told you,
but I knew your mother.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.440
You did?

39:04.600 --> 39:05.600
Yeah.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.640
Yeah, she was a couple years
ahead of me at the IMB.

39:08.800 --> 39:11.880
A remarkable woman, brilliant.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.120
Bold.

39:15.760 --> 39:16.760
Unafraid.

39:18.880 --> 39:22.040
Alright. So I better get going.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.680
I'll come with you.

40:05.080 --> 40:06.360
Pick up, pick up.

40:16.640 --> 40:19.320
Once you get the footage
from the Deepwater, you contact me.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.320
-I will.
-Take care, Charlie.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.840
You too.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.280
Fuck. Come on, Charlie.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.200
Professor Lehmann. Professor Lehmann!

40:54.640 --> 40:55.720
Katherina, I just...

40:55.880 --> 40:58.960
There's been a slide.
You need to get to high ground. Now!

40:59.120 --> 41:01.560
-There's a tsunami forming.
-Wait, wait, wait.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.960
Sigur, the tsunami is coming your way.

41:05.640 --> 41:09.040
Yeah. Hey, hey. Open. Open.
Open the door!

42:15.840 --> 42:17.120
Charlie!

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Hey!

42:32.800 --> 42:33.880
Hey!

42:36.600 --> 42:37.640
Charlie!

42:47.440 --> 42:49.000
Kare! Kare!

42:50.840 --> 42:52.320
Kare!

43:07.600 --> 43:10.600
I have to warn them! Let go!

43:11.120 --> 43:12.120
Listen to me!

43:23.960 --> 43:26.080
No! Leave me! Let me go!

43:26.240 --> 43:27.840
We can't go. We can't...

43:28.080 --> 43:30.680
Stop! Hey! Please!

43:36.280 --> 43:38.920
There's nothing we can do.
Alright? I'm sorry.

43:39.440 --> 43:42.600
I'm sorry. We leave now or we die!

43:43.360 --> 43:44.640
Hi, this is Sigur Johanson.

43:44.800 --> 43:48.400
Please leave your name and number and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

43:49.080 --> 43:51.120
Okay? Come on.

43:52.480 --> 43:54.880
Sigur, it's me.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.120
I just wanted you to know...

44:00.400 --> 44:03.200
I can't imagine
a life without you either.

44:29.880 --> 44:30.880
Go!
