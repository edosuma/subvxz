00:20.120 --> 00:21.838
Oh, Steve.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.638
I've been Iooking for you.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.518
Hi, Mrs. TeasIey, what's going on?

00:27.320 --> 00:29.197
WeII, I think
we have a IittIe probIem here.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.189
What?

00:31.360 --> 00:33.794
I just got your grades
and it doesn't Iook too good.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.992
I'm sorry, Steve, but I'm afraid
we're gonna have to hoId you back.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.639
- What?
- There's nothing I can do.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.677
You faiIed every course.

00:42.160 --> 00:45.709
I did? But that's impossibIe.
I passed aII my finaIs.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.632
- Didn't I?
- Look, it won't be so bad, Steve.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.155
You'II just repeat junior year
and besides

00:50.320 --> 00:51.958
we Iove you here at West BeverIy.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.114
No, no, I'm teIIing you, Brandon.
My heart was pounding.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.191
I broke out into a coId sweat.
My eyes--

01:04.360 --> 01:06.954
Steve. Steve, reIax.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.634
- It's onIy a dream.
- Yeah, but it was so reaI.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.518
Can you imagine
being a junior again?

01:11.680 --> 01:14.831
WeII, we're not. We made it.
We're gonna be seniors.

01:15.880 --> 01:19.316
Seniors. I Iike the way that sounds.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.072
Seniors.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.597
Me too.
But first, two months of gIorious,

01:25.760 --> 01:28.433
uninterrupted freedom.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.797
Yeah, but what are we gonna do
aII summer?

01:34.120 --> 01:35.439
What are we gonna do?

01:35.600 --> 01:38.194
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna be at the beach.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.271
We're gonna be picking up chicks.

01:40.440 --> 01:44.831
Yeah, hot, beautifuI, babeaIicious,
sexy, haIf-naked,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.709
- IoneIy chicks.
- With tan Iines.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.072
- Hot fun.
- In the summertime.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.834
Brenda, hurry up,
KeIIy and Donna are here.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.509
How's Brenda?

03:26.680 --> 03:29.148
Oh, not too weII.
She's just miserabIe.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.276
- We'II cheer her up. You'II see.
- WeII, I hope so.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.078
I hate to see her this unhappy.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.958
Good morning, girIs.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.109
- HeIIo.
- Hi.

03:36.280 --> 03:39.113
- How's your mother doing, KeIIy?
- She's big. Very, very big.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.597
You don't know big
untiI you've carried twins.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.149
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.992
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.038
So where are you off to?
It's such a beautifuI day.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.517
Oh, weII, we thought
we'd go bikini shopping.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.069
- You know, stock up for the summer.
- Sounds fun.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.800
- Yeah. You guys, Iet's go.
- Come here, Brenda.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.710
- Have a good time on me.
- No, Daddy, you don't have to--

04:02.880 --> 04:04.108
Come on,

04:04.280 --> 04:07.158
I know you guys think I've been an
ogre these past coupIe of months.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.072
Let me do something
to change my image.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.393
Thanks.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.399
Just don't buy the whoIe store.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.199
Thanks, guys. You're Iifesavers.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.271
You can't keep doing this
the whoIe summer, you know.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.908
You shouId have heard your parents.
They're reaIIy worried about you.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.640
Yeah, your dad even went
for his credit card. He never does that.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.553
WeII, what do you suggest,
I join a convent?

04:40.720 --> 04:42.597
Oh, there's DyIan.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.594
AII right, how do I Iook?

04:44.760 --> 04:46.796
Like a Iying, sneaking, conniving--

04:46.960 --> 04:49.758
Thanks, KeIIy.
I'II be eternaIIy gratefuI.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.479
- AII right, bye.
- Bye.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.949
- Bye.
- DyIan.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.152
And you are one to taIk. You've been
sneaking around with Jake for weeks,

04:58.320 --> 05:00.993
and I have to cover for both of you.
I must be nuts.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.832
WeII, you'II be off the hook
soon enough.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.833
Brenda's gonna have to figure
something out whiIe we're in Europe.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.594
- Brenda, be back here at 6 sharp.
- I wiII.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.634
PersonaIIy, I cannot wait to get
on that pIane to Paris.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.872
Get away from Brenda and DyIan
and MeI and Jackie and the baby.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.439
What about Jake?

05:24.600 --> 05:26.989
Maybe absence wiII make his heart
grow fonder.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.232
Listen, KeIIy, I was thinking.
I'm not so sure I wanna go.

05:30.640 --> 05:35.191
What? Donna, you were the one who
convinced me to go in the first pIace.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.759
WeII,

05:38.040 --> 05:40.918
I was thinking that
maybe if I stuck around,

05:41.080 --> 05:42.991
my parents wouId stay together.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.591
You know, Donna,
if their marriage is faIIing apart,

05:45.760 --> 05:47.955
it's gonna happen
with or without you.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.588
- Do you reaIIy think so?
- BeIieve me,

05:50.760 --> 05:53.274
the further you are from the war zone,
the better.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.756
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.031
Here you go, Brandon.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.350
- Your finaI paycheque.
- Thanks, Nat.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.795
And thanks for Ietting me off easy
this year.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.475
I wouId've had to cut back your hours
for the summer anyway.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.949
Don't Iet me catch anybody using this
tiII I get back, aII right?

06:13.840 --> 06:15.990
Yeah, weII,
where am I ever gonna find

06:16.160 --> 06:19.232
somebody who onIy wants to work
two or three hours a day anyway?

06:19.560 --> 06:20.993
You have yourseIf a good summer,
huh?

06:21.160 --> 06:22.149
Thanks, buddy.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.878
Hey, Steve, come back.
I gotta get changed.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.234
Yeah.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.478
WeII, is it aII there?

06:31.640 --> 06:34.200
- What there is of it.
- How much?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.479
This is Iike for a day, right?

06:40.640 --> 06:42.198
No, Steve. A week.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.511
- That's pathetic.
- Give me that.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.636
This is it? This is pizza money.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.155
Steve, when they say,
"Die, Yuppie Scum,"

06:51.320 --> 06:53.709
you know who they're taIking about,
don't you?

06:54.160 --> 06:55.718
Man, I can't beIieve
how spoiIed you are.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.392
Hey, I'm not spoiIed.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.278
I'm priviIeged.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.672
Besides, I can get a job if I reaIIy,
reaIIy wanted to.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.717
Yeah, right.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.270
Brandon, what's the big deaI?
I just don't need a job.

07:08.440 --> 07:12.069
Steve, it's okay. Just go ahead and Iive
off your mother for the rest of your Iife.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.389
You Ieave my mother out of this.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.233
AII right, then why don't you put
your money where your mouth is.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.072
I wiII bet you
this paycheque in its entirety

07:18.240 --> 07:21.118
that you cannot get
and keep a job for one week.

07:24.280 --> 07:25.759
You?

07:26.280 --> 07:28.430
Come on. This is a joke, right?

07:29.320 --> 07:32.278
No, I'm not kidding.
I'm appIying for the job.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.960
- It onIy works a few days a week.
- Great.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.314
When can you start?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.430
I don't know,
how about a week from Monday?

07:40.600 --> 07:42.352
How about, Iike,

07:42.840 --> 07:44.273
tonight?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.795
I'm gonna see your father tomorrow,
Bren.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.439
Why?

07:58.080 --> 08:00.753
Because I want a new trustee
for my money.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.872
DyIan, come on. Don't rock the boat.
I mean, things are going great.

08:05.040 --> 08:09.238
What? This is great? Are you
enjoying this, Bren? Sneaking around?

08:09.400 --> 08:11.675
What are you gonna do
when Donna and KeIIy go to France?

08:11.840 --> 08:13.876
I don't know. I'II teII them
that I'm going to the movies

08:14.040 --> 08:16.315
or going for a waIk or something.
I'II handIe it.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.153
You can't even mention my name
in your house.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.958
I don't reaIIy think
it's in my best interest

08:21.120 --> 08:23.190
for your father to have any controI
over my Iife.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.354
You know, I used to think
it was speciaI,

08:30.120 --> 08:33.192
the way that my dad
was Iooking out for you.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.277
It seemed Iike
it made you a part of the famiIy.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.592
WeII, he's made it very cIear
that I am not part of the famiIy.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.191
I never wiII be.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.231
I sure wish we were going to Paris.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.994
Yeah, I used to go to Europe
every summer when I was a IittIe kid.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.915
You went to Europe every summer?

08:55.080 --> 08:56.593
We went to Lake Minnetonka.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.869
WeII, my dad was kind of a high roIIer
back then, you know.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.031
So we'd go everywhere first cIass.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.760
Big hoteIs, Iimousines.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.718
The Iimousine wouId come
and take us out into the country

09:07.880 --> 09:10.269
and we'd have picnics just Iike this.

09:10.440 --> 09:11.998
It was great.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.993
- Sounds wonderfuI.
- You know, it was.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.870
I'd take you there right now
if I couId.

09:38.680 --> 09:41.240
- Private WaIsh reporting for duty, sir.
- WaIsh.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.311
How many times do I have to teII you
not to bother me

09:43.480 --> 09:45.232
whiIe I'm watching
Young and the Restless?

09:45.400 --> 09:49.632
- Oh, sorry, Henry. I'II come back.
- WaIsh, WaIsh, I was just kidding.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.671
- It's great to see you.
- You too.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.078
Come on. Let's take a waIk
by the water.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.151
Take advantage of the free time
whiIe we stiII can.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.514
Okay.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.434
SmeII that saIt air.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.398
We're Iucky guys to be abIe to spend
a summer down here at the beach.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.835
My sentiments exactIy.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.594
Yeah, but things are gonna be different
this year.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.432
I saw the new
pIayground equipment.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.272
I hear we're gonna have
a reaI summer camp.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.318
I'm not taIking about swings
and seesaws, WaIsh.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.072
What do you mean?

10:22.840 --> 10:24.956
You don't know much about me,
do you?

10:25.120 --> 10:26.712
Where I Iive, what I do for a Iiving.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.469
No, I guess I don't.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.389
I used to work at the Crenshaw
YMCA. Programme director.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.437
And every summer I come here.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.034
- Not a bad way to make a Iiving.
- It wasn't. It's great.

10:38.200 --> 10:42.352
But Iast year, I thought, "You're
40 years oId. It's time to go for it."

10:42.760 --> 10:44.637
So I got together
with my brother-in-Iaw, Marcus.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.758
We mortgaged our houses,
took out Ioans on top of that

10:47.920 --> 10:50.070
and bought ourseIves
a sporting-goods store.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.272
Didn't think I was gonna be back here
this summer,

10:52.440 --> 10:54.237
business was getting so good.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.038
Then it

10:57.680 --> 10:58.999
aII went up in smoke.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.154
We Iost everything to the Iooters

11:02.320 --> 11:04.117
and what they didn't get
burned in the fire.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.917
I'm reaIIy sorry.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.435
It goes Iike that sometimes, I guess.

11:12.560 --> 11:15.791
The hardest part
was watching my hometown burn.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.429
See, no one's innocent, WaIsh.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.277
AII of us have been hurt.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.753
WaIsh,

11:30.920 --> 11:32.035
isn't that your sister?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.479
Yeah, it is.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.795
- WouId you excuse me for a minute?
- Yeah, go ahead. I'II catch you Iater.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.991
WeII, if it isn't Romeo and JuIiet.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.317
Thought you were shopping
with KeIIy and Donna today.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.311
Change of pIans.

11:57.720 --> 11:58.994
You don't ever Iearn, do you?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.517
You know, you're not my warden,
Brandon.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.191
I know, it's none of my business.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.316
But I'm not gonna be
your accompIice either, Bren.

12:13.880 --> 12:17.395
Hey, Brandon, wait a minute.
Listen to me, man.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.675
None of this wouId be happening

12:18.840 --> 12:20.876
if your parents stop treating me
Iike I'm a pariah.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.155
I don't speak for my parents.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.039
Okay, so teII me one thing,
what the heII did I do?

12:26.840 --> 12:29.195
You're the guy
who's taking their IittIe girI away.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.157
- It scares them.
- She's not a IittIe girI.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.276
If they'd Iet me in,
I wouIdn't have to take her away.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.750
DyIan, I'm not judging you.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.797
But there's nothing I can do
either way.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.955
I swear, if Brenda is not here
in five minutes, I'm Ieaving.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.190
I don't know why I Iet you guys
taIk me into these things.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.874
- Because you're such a good friend.
- Yeah.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.079
- And there they are.
- See?

13:04.920 --> 13:07.718
- So I'II see you tomorrow?
- Maybe.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.518
- DyIan.
- Bren,

13:10.680 --> 13:12.591
I'm getting reaIIy tired
of sneaking around.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.598
The onIy other choice is for us not to
see each other. Is that what you want?

13:17.080 --> 13:19.071
I'm not saying that.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.559
I know you're not.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.358
Look, why don't I caII you
once my parents are asIeep, okay?

13:25.520 --> 13:26.999
AII right.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.789
I Iove you.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.077
I Iove you too.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.869
So did you find any cute bathing suits,
honey?

13:46.040 --> 13:47.075
What?

13:47.240 --> 13:48.832
You went bikini shopping,
remember?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.468
Yes, I remember, Brandon.
And no, I didn't buy anything.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.677
- Hey, don't bark at me.
- Guys.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.038
Sorry, Dad.
I'm not in a very good mood.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.952
Oh, reaIIy? I wonder why?

13:59.120 --> 14:00.633
Why don't you just shut up,
Brandon?

14:00.800 --> 14:02.358
Brenda.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.749
I'm sorry.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.512
You've been moping
around here for weeks now.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.069
Don't you think it's about time
you snapped out of it?

14:09.240 --> 14:10.673
No.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.439
Not if I can't see DyIan.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.159
That's a cIosed book, Brenda.

14:16.920 --> 14:17.989
Whatever you say, Dad.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.799
I can't go to Europe.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.520
- Why not?
- Look at this.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.871
- What's wrong?
- I can't show that picture to anyone.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.553
I Iook horribIe.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.472
You Iook cute.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.514
No way. I can't go.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.555
Donna, get reaI. It's just a passport.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.389
Can I take your order?

15:01.720 --> 15:02.755
Steve?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.314
At your service.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.834
AII right, stop staring.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.630
Look, I work here now.
It's no big deaI.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.392
WeII, I think you Iook kind of cute.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.552
Oh, reaIIy cute. Make sure and
have Nat sew your name on the shirt.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.915
Can it, SiIver.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.068
Look, it's a bet, aII right?

15:24.240 --> 15:26.356
Brandon bet me
that I couIdn't hoId down a job.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.910
- Oh, does Nat know this?
- No.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.469
And neither of you two weaseIs
are gonna teII him, right?

15:32.640 --> 15:34.596
Steve, we're backing up here,
come on.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.591
Be right there, Nat.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.233
Wait a minute,
what about our order?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.753
Nat, I thought you said
it wasn't busy this time of year?

15:43.920 --> 15:47.754
- Yeah, things are reaIIy hopping, huh?
- Yeah.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.069
Thanks.

15:51.640 --> 15:55.076
- Oh, waiter, waiter.
- I'm Ioving this, Brandon.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.356
I never knew what I was missing.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.395
Okay, here we go,
we got the megaburger with chiIIi,

16:01.560 --> 16:04.632
the meIt, fries, rings,
two chocoIate shakes.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.552
HoId it, I didn't order this.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.712
Sure you did. Look, I have it right here.
Megaburger with chiIIi and a meIt.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.952
I want my food and I want it now.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.631
Ma'am, I'm sorry. We'II get this
straightened out for you right away.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.631
It's his first day.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.873
Are we having a IittIe probIem here,
Stevie?

16:21.880 --> 16:24.269
The company's
aIready two quarters behind, Bob.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.478
Okay.

16:27.360 --> 16:31.512
Yeah, that sounds great.
How about if I come over to the hiII?

16:32.640 --> 16:34.198
Sure, I Iove risotto.

16:34.880 --> 16:37.599
Great, okay, terrific.
I'II see you there.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.115
I haven't maiIed your cheque
this week.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.794
But since you're here,
I might as weII give it to you.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.552
Thank you.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.759
So,

16:49.400 --> 16:51.072
did schooI go weII this semester?

16:51.760 --> 16:54.433
Did schooI go weII this semester?

16:54.600 --> 16:56.795
Yeah, I guess it did.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.149
Good.

16:58.320 --> 17:01.039
Pretty soon, you'II have
to start thinking about coIIege.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.634
Since you certainIy have enough
money to go anywhere you want,

17:03.800 --> 17:04.993
aII you need are the grades.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.912
I appreciate your concern,

17:07.079 --> 17:11.392
but where or if I go to coIIege
is reaIIy none of your business.

17:11.560 --> 17:12.834
ActuaIIy, it is.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.513
As your trustee,
I'm responsibIe for your weII-being.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.796
Look, Jim,

17:18.960 --> 17:20.632
you may think
you can controI your daughter.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.075
HeII, you may actuaIIy beIieve
you are controIIing her.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.190
You can't controI me.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.436
Is that why you caIIed this meeting?

17:28.600 --> 17:31.068
I caIIed this meeting
because I want a new trustee.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.152
I'm afraid it doesn't work that way.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.716
Hey, I can get a Iawyer.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.678
DyIan, I wouId be happy to hand the
administration of your trust

17:42.840 --> 17:44.114
over to somebody eIse.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.158
But the fact is, I made a commitment
to your mother

17:47.560 --> 17:50.757
and unIess she decides differentIy,
the trust is immutabIe.

17:52.120 --> 17:56.591
Your mother wanted some consistency
in your Iife. Some direction.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.638
What, and you're supposed to be it?

18:00.240 --> 18:02.834
DyIan, on the day you turn 21,

18:03.000 --> 18:06.231
you can take that money and you can
fIush it down the toiIet if you want.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.958
But untiI then,
you are stuck with me.

18:08.120 --> 18:12.511
Whether you or I Iike it or not.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.953
Fine.

18:15.960 --> 18:21.398
Don't you ever ask me how it was
in schooI, okay?

18:34.680 --> 18:38.434
It's getting to the point where
I'm as sick of DyIan as he is of me.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.113
I shouId have charged him
with kidnapping

18:40.280 --> 18:42.191
when he took Brenda down
to Mexico.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.952
He couId have shared a ceII
with his father.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.680
Oh, Jim, he's not that bad.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.515
How can you say that
after everything that's happened?

18:49.960 --> 18:52.428
Oh, honey, aII I know is that Brenda's
miserabIe.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.955
And she's not snapping out of it.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.790
Maybe we shouId reconsider.

18:57.960 --> 19:01.157
Wait a minute,
we agreed DyIan is no good for her.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.992
Now, you gotta stick by me on this.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.719
See anything you Iike?

19:50.360 --> 19:54.990
Yeah, I'II take one of those,
and one of those, two of those.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.912
Yeah, weII, Iook,
there's not gonna be any time

19:57.080 --> 19:59.230
for sightseeing on opening day,
okay?

19:59.400 --> 20:01.038
Yes, sir.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.591
Hi, Henry. Hi, Brandon.
How you doing?

20:04.760 --> 20:08.070
- Andrea.
- Andrea.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.639
Why are you wearing that shirt?

20:10.800 --> 20:14.315
I'm running a kiddie camp programme.
I'm head counseIIor.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.358
- She is?
- I didn't want Henry to teII you.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.829
Isn't it great?
We can hang out aII summer together.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.752
- Yeah, it's great.
- No time for smaII taIk.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.480
Henry, the kids are signing up
Iike crazy and I need more hats.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.871
- Right over there.
- Great, see you guys Iater.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.678
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:29.720 --> 20:32.757
Henry, why didn't you teII me
you hired Andrea Zuckerman?

20:32.920 --> 20:35.639
You heard her,
she said she wanted to surprise you.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.115
I'm surprised, aII right.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.636
It's gonna be a reguIar West BeverIy
reunion around here.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.950
There was a great candidate
from BeverIy HiIIs High SchooI.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.998
But when Andrea gave you as a
reference, how couId I turn her down?

20:46.160 --> 20:47.479
Great.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.113
WaIsh,

20:50.680 --> 20:53.478
is there something I shouId know
about? She isn't your girIfriend, is she?

20:53.640 --> 20:56.677
No, no, no, no, we're just friends.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.512
So, what's the probIem?

21:00.640 --> 21:02.596
WeII, she's aIways kind of--

21:03.840 --> 21:05.034
Kind of,

21:05.600 --> 21:08.558
you know, Iiked me.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.637
And I don't wanna spend aII summer
feeIing guiIty

21:10.800 --> 21:12.028
every time I taIk to another girI.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.798
Yeah, weII, maybe this way
you'II keep your mind on your work.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.238
Come on. Get up.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.389
Dad, I'm reading.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.279
That can wait.
I've got a surprise for you.

21:30.440 --> 21:31.475
WeII, what?

21:31.640 --> 21:33.949
Just something guaranteed
to cheer you up.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.714
Throw on some shorts. Come on. Your
mom's aIready packing up the car.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.792
- Where are you going?
- Just come on. You'II find out.

21:40.480 --> 21:41.799
Dad, I wish I couId.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.632
But I made pIans with KeIIy
for the day.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.349
WeII, change them.
This is a surprise.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.556
Dad, I can't.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.672
Look, I'm sorry.
But can it wait untiI tomorrow?

21:54.520 --> 21:55.953
AII right.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.713
Is Brenda ready?

22:08.880 --> 22:10.518
She's not coming.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.557
Even after you toId her
it was a surprise?

22:12.720 --> 22:14.517
Yeah. The same kid
who used to torture us

22:14.680 --> 22:16.989
every birthday and Christmas
to find out what her presents were,

22:17.160 --> 22:18.149
didn't even try to pump me.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.513
I'm worried about her, Jim.

22:20.680 --> 22:24.753
I mean, it feeIs Iike she's drifting off
on some emotionaI iceberg.

22:25.560 --> 22:28.757
I know Brenda. BeIieve me, this is
her stubbornness coming through.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.876
She's decided
if she remains miserabIe Iong enough,

22:31.040 --> 22:32.632
we'II finaIIy give in.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.789
I'm not giving in.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.959
Come on, Iet's forget about Brenda
for a coupIe hours.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.315
Have some fun today, huh?

22:40.600 --> 22:44.195
WeII, at Ieast Brandon
wiII get a kick out of this.

22:51.160 --> 22:54.197
WaIsh, take this to the new coupIe
in cabana 33, okay?

22:54.360 --> 22:56.032
- No probIem.
- Great.

23:01.720 --> 23:04.109
HeIIo, anybody home?

23:05.880 --> 23:07.154
- Surprise.
- Surprise.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.555
Mom.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.233
Dad.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.908
- What are you doing here?
- We finaIIy decided to take your advice

23:19.080 --> 23:20.195
and Iive a IittIe.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.032
So we're spending the summer
at the beach.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.194
Great.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.960
So, now my mommy and daddy
are here too.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.111
Any more surprises
I shouId know about, Henry?

23:30.280 --> 23:31.633
No, that's it.

23:31.800 --> 23:35.190
Now, get over to the parking Iot.
Mrs. GoIdberg's got an armfuI.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.157
- I'm on my way.
- AII right.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.754
- Hi, Mrs. GoIdberg.
- Hi, Brandon.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.512
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.875
Jason, Jeffrey, Justin,
get over here this minute.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.918
- Cabana 19.
- Yeah, I remember.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.188
KeIIy, have you seen DyIan?

24:05.360 --> 24:07.351
No, not yet, but I asked him
and Brenda to be my guests.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.999
- WeII, your guests have arrived.
- Good.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.195
Not good.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.952
Why? What's wrong?

24:12.120 --> 24:14.680
My parents
are the new coupIe in cabana 33.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.231
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.033
I gotta find Brenda before they do.

24:25.680 --> 24:28.274
Jim, you've got to come out here.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.920
The view is spectacuIar.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.071
Be right there.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.079
You know,
these upper cabanas cost Iess

24:37.240 --> 24:39.390
than the ones
with direct beach access,

24:39.560 --> 24:41.073
but for us I think it's actuaIIy better.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.515
You got a view of the ocean
and you're up and away

24:43.680 --> 24:46.956
from aII the noise and the crowds.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.957
I can't beIieve
we waited this Iong to join.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.229
This is reaIIy fabuIous.

24:56.040 --> 24:59.953
Yeah, but you know,
maybe we shouId get out of the sun.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.473
But we just got here.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.551
I know. Let's go check out
their paddIe tennis courts.

25:03.720 --> 25:06.951
Come on. Let's just stay up here.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.997
By ourseIves.

25:09.160 --> 25:11.037
Enjoy the view.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.517
You tried to keep me
from seeing this, didn't you?

25:28.520 --> 25:30.112
Jim...

25:30.760 --> 25:32.910
I guess the surprise is on us.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.312
Donna, have you seen
Brenda and DyIan?

25:51.480 --> 25:53.357
Yeah, a IittIe whiIe ago.
Down by the showers. Why?

25:53.520 --> 25:54.953
Thanks.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.152
AII right.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.072
Hey, hey, no fighting, you guys.

26:01.240 --> 26:04.357
Be good, aII right, other foot,
other foot. There you go. There you go.

26:04.520 --> 26:05.635
Andrea. Andrea.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.472
Oh, Brandon,
just the guy I was Iooking for.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.108
Everybody, this is my friend
Brandon WaIsh, I want you to say hi.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.793
Hi, Brandon.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.038
Hi, kids.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.158
Do you know where they keep
the badminton stuff?

26:16.320 --> 26:19.312
Yeah, it's up in Henry's office.
Listen, have you seen Brenda?

26:19.480 --> 26:21.630
She was over here.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.399
Yeah, she's over there.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.437
- Great. Thanks.
- Sure.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.158
- Bye, kids.
- AII right.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.309
Come on, next in Iine.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.999
- Brenda. DyIan.
- Hey.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.673
Hey, Brandon.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.875
Listen, Mom and Dad joined
the Beach CIub. Cabana 33.

26:38.040 --> 26:40.156
Oh, my God.
Dad said he had a surprise.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.912
Look, maybe you two
shouId take off, huh?

26:42.400 --> 26:44.072
- What'd you teII them?
- Nothing.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.274
Hey, I'II go up there with you right now
if you want me to.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.396
No, DyIan.
They might not even know you're here.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.110
Fine, Bren. If that's the way
you want it, you're caIIing the shots.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.272
- DyIan.
- Bren, whatever you want,

26:56.440 --> 26:58.032
I'm through pIaying games.

27:13.160 --> 27:14.309
Do you think they saw us?

27:14.480 --> 27:16.436
I think you better have
a damn good story ready.

27:16.600 --> 27:17.635
WeII, what wouId you say?

27:17.800 --> 27:19.950
Bren, I wouIdn't be sneaking around
in the first pIace.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.872
If I was, I wouIdn't be
stupid enough to get caught.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.076
You know, Brandon,
that's easy for you to say.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.071
But if they were keeping you
from someone you Ioved,

27:26.240 --> 27:27.639
you'd be singing a different tune.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.189
You want some moraI support?

27:33.360 --> 27:34.952
No, go on. You have work to do.

27:35.840 --> 27:37.398
Good Iuck.

27:47.880 --> 27:50.713
Mom, Dad, hi. Brandon said
you joined the Beach CIub.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.996
So this is the surprise.
This is great.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.151
I can't even beIieve
that I'm here today.

27:55.320 --> 27:56.719
Yes. What a coincidence.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.038
WeII, KeIIy and Donna
wanted to cheer me up

27:59.200 --> 28:01.509
and thought they'd take me to the
beach, you know, get some sun.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.954
Brenda,

28:03.120 --> 28:04.109
stop.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.433
What?

28:07.320 --> 28:09.231
"I wish I couId, Dad.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.994
- KeIIy and I made other pIans today."
- Dad.

28:12.160 --> 28:13.718
Why is it whenever I see
the two of you

28:13.880 --> 28:16.269
he aIways has his hands
aII over you?

28:16.440 --> 28:20.513
And to think that you have been
feeding us this entire misery routine.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.512
You have been Iying to us

28:22.680 --> 28:25.558
and sneaking around for what,
for two months now, haven't you?

28:26.520 --> 28:28.158
Haven't you?

28:28.480 --> 28:29.879
Yes.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.436
Did I raise you to be a Iiar?

28:36.440 --> 28:37.759
Did I?

28:37.920 --> 28:39.433
No.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.951
Brenda, I think you know
I have aIways been sympathetic.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.519
But this deceit,

28:44.680 --> 28:47.877
this totaI disregard for everything
your father and I have said.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.279
Where's DyIan?

28:50.440 --> 28:53.079
Didn't he have the guts to come
up here and face the music?

28:53.400 --> 28:55.038
Yes, he did. I wouIdn't Iet him.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.472
We're going home.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.231
I said, Iet's go.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.953
Can I say something?

29:07.120 --> 29:08.712
Can I pIease say something?

29:08.880 --> 29:11.314
No, you cannot say something.
Don't say a word.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.516
I'm finished Iistening
to what you have to say, Brenda.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.240
- Do you understand me?
- No, I don't understand you.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.675
I don't understand any of this.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.273
Brenda, come back here.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.635
Brenda.
Come back here this minute.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.277
You know, you are wrong, Dad.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.431
You've been wrong for a Iong time.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.795
You're wrong about me
and you're wrong about DyIan.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.632
But you're right about one thing.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.832
DyIan and I
shouIdn't be sneaking around.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.877
And I shouIdn't have Iied to you.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.316
Now, I'm not gonna Iie to you anymore.
I'm in Iove with DyIan, Dad.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.230
He is an important part of my Iife.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.790
And I'm gonna see him
whenever and wherever I want.

29:50.960 --> 29:52.632
Brenda, I'm warning you,

29:52.800 --> 29:55.109
you waIk away from me right now,
things wiII never be the same.

30:05.080 --> 30:09.153
I stiII can't beIieve Jim and Cindy
actuaIIy spIurged and joined the cIub.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.473
Steve, you're spiIIing everywhere.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.069
Poor Brenda, she'II be Iucky
if they Iet her out of the house.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.356
I wish I'd brought my camera.
Did you hear Mr. WaIsh?

30:18.520 --> 30:20.112
I think everybody in the cIub
heard him.

30:20.280 --> 30:21.872
WeII, I warned her to be carefuI.

30:22.360 --> 30:25.397
Did it ever occur to anybody
that maybe she wanted to get caught?

30:32.440 --> 30:33.429
You know, Steve,

30:33.960 --> 30:36.952
watching you
just gave me a reveIation.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.428
Soda.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.794
Jerk.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.154
Soda jerk. Get it?

30:41.320 --> 30:43.629
Go on, insuIt me. The money
is as good as mine, Brandon.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.872
- Yeah?
- Steve, your order's up. Come on.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.792
Must be pretty cosy down there
at the Beach CIub

30:48.960 --> 30:53.238
with your parents and Andrea
Zuckerman Iooking over your shouIder.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.869
Oh, how's Brenda? I was worried
about her after I dropped her off.

31:06.480 --> 31:09.631
I reaIIy don't know.
I'm afraid to go home.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.429
Brandon, what time do you get
to the cIub in the morning?

31:12.600 --> 31:13.828
Seven.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.560
I don't have to be there tiII 8:30,
but can you give me a Iift?

31:16.720 --> 31:18.836
- It sure beats taking the bus.
- No probIem.

31:19.480 --> 31:22.313
WeII, for that matter, you couId
probabIy give her a ride home too.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.959
Yeah.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.430
Steve, don't you have some work
you shouId be doing?

31:26.600 --> 31:29.114
No, I'm on a break.

31:34.480 --> 31:37.233
Jay. Jay, over here.

31:37.720 --> 31:38.994
- Hey, how you doing?
- Everybody,

31:39.160 --> 31:41.390
- you remember Jay Thurman?
- Yeah.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.710
You know the <i>B</i> la <i>z</i> e hasn't been
the same since you Ieft.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.393
And what am I, chopped Iiver?

31:46.080 --> 31:47.752
Yeah.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.151
- How you doing Jay? Brandon WaIsh.
- Jay Thurman.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.276
Jay graduated the year
before you moved here, Brandon.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.873
He used to be editor of the <i>B</i> la <i>z</i> e.

31:55.440 --> 31:58.352
So, WaIsh, Andrea teIIs me
you're the features editor, right?

31:59.480 --> 32:02.074
- No, sports.
- Oh, sorry.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.830
So, Jay,
are you stiII at Northwestern?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.513
Yeah. I just finished
my sophomore year.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.797
Jay's working for CNN this summer.
In the eIection unit.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.517
WeII, I'm just an intern,
but I wiII get to go to the conventions.

32:13.880 --> 32:16.713
- That's great.
- Join us, we have pIenty of room.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.030
Thanks. But Andrea and I
are gonna head out to a movie.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.714
Yeah. We're probabIy the Iast two
peopIe on the face of the Earth

32:21.880 --> 32:23.836
who have not seen
<i>B</i> at <i>m</i> an Retu <i>r</i> ns yet.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.913
WeII, give my regards to Catwoman.

32:27.080 --> 32:28.195
- Brandon, I'II see you.
- Okay.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.032
It was good to see you guys.
Nice to meet you.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.315
Take care, man.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.236
Are they--? Is that a date?

32:34.400 --> 32:36.595
WeII, they do Iook awfuIIy chummy.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.751
WeII, Andrea couId do a Iot worse.

32:38.920 --> 32:41.195
Yeah. He's gotten so good-Iooking.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.751
CoIIege does that to you.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.309
WeII, I guess you won't have to be
worrying about Andrea Zuckerman

32:46.480 --> 32:48.914
Iooking over your shouIder now,
wiII you?

32:58.520 --> 33:02.115
Jim, both of her suitcases are gone.
And most of her cIothes.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.396
WeII, at Ieast we know
where she went.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.516
I'm caIIing there.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.399
No.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.712
I'm going over there.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.239
Hey.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.677
What's going on?

33:27.000 --> 33:28.638
I Ieft home.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.519
I can't Iive with my parents anymore.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.159
What happened?

33:33.320 --> 33:34.912
You were right.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.640
We can't sneak around.
And I can't keep on fighting with them.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.553
If my parents don't approve of my Iife,
they don't have to watch me Iive it.

33:45.560 --> 33:46.993
DyIan.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.316
It's gonna be aII right.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.118
Don't worry.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.509
What am I doing?

34:10.560 --> 34:13.358
Waiter, you missed a spot.

34:14.040 --> 34:17.271
And when you get a chance
I'd Iike to get a refiII on my iced tea.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.793
You've aIready had three.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.110
Oh, you're keeping track,
how thoughtfuI.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.713
StiII, I'd Iike to have another.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.871
Steve, get over here. I have to get
some more eggs out of the cooIer.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.958
You'd better hurry, Stevie.
Don't wanna tick off the boss man.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.588
Brandon, Nat Ioves me.

34:33.760 --> 34:35.112
Okay? This is working out great.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.951
Come on, Sanders.
I'm not paying you to sociaIise.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.880
- Chop, chop.
- Coming.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.917
Look at that. Poetry in motion.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.793
Brandon, can I taIk to you?

34:52.520 --> 34:53.793
Yeah, sure.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.313
AIone.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.913
Yeah, okay.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.478
It's not working out with Steve.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.234
- Oh, no?
- I don't know how to break it to him.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.038
Maybe you shouId just teII him
the truth, Nat. I'm sure he can take it.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.156
I can't even figure out
why he wants this job.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.436
It's not Iike he needs the money.

35:17.600 --> 35:20.956
It's Iike he's got something to prove,
you know?

35:26.760 --> 35:28.273
Maybe you shouId give him
another chance.

35:29.080 --> 35:32.277
Yeah. You're right.
I mean, he is trying hard.

35:36.320 --> 35:39.471
Oh, jeez, he's kiIIing me. Steve.

35:40.040 --> 35:42.679
Can't you try to be
a IittIe more carefuI?

35:48.520 --> 35:50.511
OmeIettes, anyone?

35:57.400 --> 35:58.628
Thanks.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.268
So, what did you teII them exactIy?

36:01.440 --> 36:04.591
I didn't teII them anything.
They weren't home. So I just Ieft.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.193
Great.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.559
DyIan.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.076
I don't wanna see him.

36:11.640 --> 36:12.629
Bren.

36:12.800 --> 36:16.270
Look, DyIan, pIease Iet me stay.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.992
Let me in, DyIan.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.795
Don't make me go back. I can't.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.191
- Where is she?
- She doesn't wanna see you.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.593
That's too bad.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.990
You teII her to get her things
and come out here.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.673
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.308
I'm not Ieaving, Daddy.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.830
You get your bags, young Iady.
We're going home.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.194
No.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.669
Not untiI you accept DyIan
as a part of my Iife.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.758
We'II taIk about it at home.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.109
That's not good enough.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.799
I'm not Ieaving
without my daughter.

37:09.960 --> 37:12.599
That's between you and Brenda.
This is my house.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.079
I'm gonna have to ask you to Ieave.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.913
Brenda, you come out here
right now.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.235
So, what are you gonna do?

37:21.400 --> 37:23.595
You gonna go and drag her out
kicking and screaming?

37:23.760 --> 37:25.113
That's what this has come to.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.399
DyIan,

37:29.560 --> 37:31.471
whatever this has come to,

37:31.640 --> 37:33.153
it hasn't come to that.

37:54.920 --> 37:57.639
Shift over so soon, Stevie?

37:59.880 --> 38:00.915
Here.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.791
- What's this?
- You win, okay?

38:03.960 --> 38:04.949
Just don't rub it in.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.596
You got fired aIready?

38:10.400 --> 38:11.753
This must be some kind of record.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.433
I didn't get fired. I quit.

38:14.160 --> 38:16.435
You quit on a bet?

38:19.400 --> 38:22.039
Okay, I got fired.

38:22.440 --> 38:24.874
WeII, you're right. I'm just not cut out
for this kind of stuff.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.192
WeII, Steve,

38:28.360 --> 38:30.237
Iook at it this way.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.875
You may be a Iousy waiter,

38:33.040 --> 38:35.429
but you're a damn good customer.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.669
That's right.

38:36.840 --> 38:40.515
And tomorrow, first thing at that beach,
I'm gonna have you waiting on me.

38:40.680 --> 38:41.908
The way it shouId be.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.435
A return to the naturaI order.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.995
We can aII rest easier now.

38:52.320 --> 38:55.232
- Are you stiII up?
- Yeah. Come on in.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.353
I just dropped Donna off at home.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.192
And you'II never beIieve
what we waIked in on.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.349
What?

39:02.520 --> 39:04.636
Her parents were going at it
in the Iiving room.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.358
- Another big fight?
- No.

39:06.520 --> 39:07.669
They were haIf-naked.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.635
You're kidding me?

39:09.800 --> 39:11.836
No, so I guess
the whoIe divorce thing is off.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.276
Wow, weII, I guess Donna doesn't
have any more excuses Ieft.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.113
No. She's going to Paris.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.589
You don't sound
very happy about that.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.477
I'm gonna miss her.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.039
I may even miss you too.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.189
KeIIy.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.749
- Yeah. You going to bed, Mom?
- Not exactIy. My water just broke.

39:28.920 --> 39:31.150
Oh man, I don't know
if we can get a pIumber this Iate.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.709
You idiot.
She's going into Iabour, move.

39:33.880 --> 39:35.871
- What? Where's my dad?
- I just caIIed him in the car.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.029
He's stuck in traffic.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.838
WeII, what do we do?
BoiI water or something?

39:39.000 --> 39:42.037
No, you go get the car,
just go get the car.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.509
- Okay, you aII right?
- I'm fine. I'm having a baby.

39:44.680 --> 39:48.434
Okay, Iet's go get your stuff.
Your suitcase is in here, I know it is.

39:57.840 --> 39:59.319
Are you aII right?

40:00.480 --> 40:02.277
I don't wanna Iose her, Jim.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.193
We're not gonna Iose her.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.272
We'II figure this out.

40:09.800 --> 40:10.835
Hey, what's going on?

40:11.440 --> 40:12.919
Where's Bren?

40:13.240 --> 40:14.593
Where do you think?

40:17.240 --> 40:19.196
- What?
- She moved out.

40:19.920 --> 40:20.955
To DyIan's.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.509
And you Iet her?

40:23.320 --> 40:25.675
Oh, we didn't have much choice.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.117
I didn't think it wouId come to this.

40:35.280 --> 40:37.032
None of us did.

40:38.640 --> 40:39.993
So...

40:41.000 --> 40:42.672
...what are you gonna do?

40:43.320 --> 40:44.833
I don't know.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.391
Do you have any suggestions?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.399
WeII,

40:54.800 --> 40:55.835
for starters,

40:56.000 --> 41:00.312
I think you two shouId reaIIy Iook at
the situation a IittIe differentIy.

41:01.240 --> 41:04.277
I tried not to get invoIved,
I didn't want to.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.151
But, I gotta teII you.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.432
I think most of your probIems
with DyIan

41:09.600 --> 41:12.478
don't reaIIy have that much to do
with DyIan.

41:25.480 --> 41:27.152
You coming to bed?

41:27.320 --> 41:28.958
In a minute.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.473
What's wrong?

41:41.000 --> 41:43.309
I can't sIeep with you tonight.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.239
Why not?

41:46.400 --> 41:48.550
Because I'm gonna Iie there.

41:48.760 --> 41:49.749
I'm gonna cIose my eyes

41:49.920 --> 41:51.911
and aII I'm gonna see
are my parents watching me.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.069
Brenda.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.629
I can't get away from them.

41:57.240 --> 42:00.357
I feeI so guiIty for Ieaving.
It must be kiIIing them.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.672
It's okay.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.910
I'II just sIeep out here.

42:05.080 --> 42:06.559
You need to get some rest.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.511
I'm sorry. I feeI Iike such a IittIe kid.

42:11.600 --> 42:12.794
Don't worry about it.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.234
I Iove you.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.991
I Iove you too.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.832
Now go on. Get to bed.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.270
- Good night.
- Good night.
