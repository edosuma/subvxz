WEBVTT

00:07.208 --> 00:09.580
Good morning, all,

00:09.580 --> 00:13.114
and welcome
to your first day
at my new school!

00:15.416 --> 00:18.249
I am waiting because
I was expecting you
to applaud.

00:19.490 --> 00:21.192
(ALL APPLAUDING)

00:21.192 --> 00:24.095
Please, you're too kind.

00:24.095 --> 00:27.328
I am Zoltan Grundy,
as you probably know,

00:27.328 --> 00:29.600
because I am extremely famous

00:29.600 --> 00:32.133
and because
you've all met
me several times.

00:33.564 --> 00:35.636
I have emailed all of you
your class schedules

00:35.636 --> 00:37.638
and assignments
for this week.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.110
(CLAPPING)

00:41.542 --> 00:45.146
No? Not now?
Okay, I'm sorry, go on.

00:45.146 --> 00:48.549
I will be providing you
with excellent facilities
and teachers,

00:48.549 --> 00:52.623
and I expect nothing
less than excellence
in return.

00:53.524 --> 00:54.555
And applause.

00:55.726 --> 00:57.088
But not now.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.662
So, does anyone
have any questions?

01:01.662 --> 01:04.665
I have a question.
Have you seen my retainer?

01:06.437 --> 01:09.069
Interesting question.
No, I have not.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.144
I have a question.
Have you checked
in your mouth?

01:13.144 --> 01:16.807
I have a question.
How dumb do you think I am?

01:19.480 --> 01:22.853
Don't you think
I would know if my retainer
were in my own mouth?

01:24.315 --> 01:25.856
It's in your mouth.

01:26.617 --> 01:27.758
This isn't mine.

01:30.161 --> 01:31.292
It's Fletcher's.

01:33.624 --> 01:34.625
Not anymore.

01:36.527 --> 01:38.399
Excuse me, Mr. Grundy,

01:38.399 --> 01:41.702
but I have
an actual
meaningful question.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.874
When will we be receiving
the student handbook

01:43.874 --> 01:45.206
covering the rules
of the school,

01:45.206 --> 01:47.208
like what is our curfew,

01:47.208 --> 01:50.681
and what's the maximum
number of stuffed animals
we can have on our beds?

01:50.681 --> 01:53.614
Please be more than twelve.
Please be more than twelve.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.187
There is no rule book.

01:56.187 --> 01:58.549
You are the best
and brightest
of your generation,

01:58.549 --> 02:02.523
and I trust you all
to figure things out
for yourselves.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.754
And if you can't,

02:03.754 --> 02:06.126
I will simply replace
you with robots.

02:07.398 --> 02:09.300
(LAUGHING)

02:10.501 --> 02:12.363
I'm kidding, of course.

02:12.363 --> 02:14.165
That technology
won't be ready for weeks.

02:15.866 --> 02:20.441
Wait, so the only rule
is there are no rules?

02:20.441 --> 02:23.474
This no-rules rule,
while logically inconsistent,

02:23.474 --> 02:25.546
is the greatest
non-rule rule ever!

02:26.717 --> 02:28.549
So you're saying that

02:28.549 --> 02:31.652
instead of having
to go to bed at 8:30
like my parents make me,

02:31.652 --> 02:36.627
I can go to bed
whenever I want, like 8:15,
or even 8:00!

02:37.728 --> 02:39.690
I'm going to get
ready for bed.

02:39.690 --> 02:41.161
But it's not even noon.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.833
I know,
but I'm feeling
a little crazy!

02:44.235 --> 02:45.636
Rules be darned!

02:45.636 --> 02:49.340
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!

I hate this
stupid phone!

03:48.829 --> 03:50.701
Excuse me, Lexi.

03:50.701 --> 03:52.533
I couldn't help overhearing.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.405
Because
my overhearing aid
was turned on.

03:55.966 --> 03:57.237
What's wrong with your phone?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.339
Everything!

03:58.339 --> 04:00.271
If it's a smart phone,

04:00.271 --> 04:02.843
why isn't it smart
enough to block messages
from boys who aren't cute?

04:02.843 --> 04:04.375
Ah.

04:04.375 --> 04:07.418
Actually,
we tried that
with the Z-Phone 2,

04:07.418 --> 04:09.350
but I could never
get through to my mother.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.683
It should also
block messages

04:12.683 --> 04:15.656
from my boyfriend-
slash-ex-boyfriend,
Chad.

04:15.656 --> 04:16.857
I'm confused.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.660
Is he your boyfriend
or your ex-boyfriend?

04:19.660 --> 04:22.393
Both. We have
a love-hate relationship.

04:22.393 --> 04:24.665
All the other
girls hate that
I'm going out with him,

04:24.665 --> 04:25.936
and I love that.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.539
Fascinating.

04:28.539 --> 04:31.372
You could give me
a real insight into the psyche
of the young consumer.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.873
I was so advanced
as a child,

04:32.873 --> 04:34.445
I never really
got to be a teenager.

04:34.445 --> 04:38.309
But I've done
extensive reading
on the teenage experience.

04:39.350 --> 04:41.412
So this Chad.

04:41.412 --> 04:43.354
Is he a vampire
or a werewolf?

04:45.756 --> 04:49.360
Hey, kid.
Have you seen Mr. Grundy?

04:49.360 --> 04:51.322
Hmm, actually, he's...
 Never mind.
Found him.

04:51.322 --> 04:52.393
He's right
behind your face.

04:54.425 --> 04:57.428
Mr. Grundy,
here are the
financial reports

04:57.428 --> 04:58.929
for the Hashimoto Soda deal.

04:58.929 --> 05:00.671
I did them entirely on my own,

05:00.671 --> 05:02.833
with no help from anyone.

05:02.833 --> 05:06.607
Unless you hate them,
in which case it was
Lotterstein from accounting.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.580
Lexi, this is
my vice-president
of acquisitions,

05:09.580 --> 05:10.981
Winter Maddox.

05:10.981 --> 05:14.645
She's in charge
of acquisitions
and she bought that outfit?

05:16.917 --> 05:18.549
Do you need a tissue?

05:18.549 --> 05:20.551
Obviously,
you're quite snotty.

05:22.092 --> 05:24.755
Anyway, shall we
discuss the deal,

05:24.755 --> 05:27.398
and then my well-deserved
and overdue promotion?

05:27.398 --> 05:30.100
Sorry, I have more important
things to deal with right now.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.933
Did you know
that it was the
one-week anniversary of Lexi's

05:32.933 --> 05:36.867
new haircut and Chad
didn't even send her flowers?

05:36.867 --> 05:40.040
You just don't
do that to a person!

05:46.677 --> 05:48.449
No rules! How cool is that?

05:48.449 --> 05:52.383
I know! Check it out!
Look how close
I am to the TV!

05:52.383 --> 05:54.525
Hope I don't
ruin my eyes!

05:54.525 --> 05:56.056
What are you watching?

05:56.056 --> 05:57.688
I have no idea,
because I can't
see anything

05:57.688 --> 05:59.359
and I have
a huge headache.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.531
But this is awesome.

06:02.132 --> 06:03.794
I've been thinking about
this no rules thing

06:03.794 --> 06:06.096
and I don't think
it's a good idea.

06:06.096 --> 06:09.400
You see, over the years
I've read dozens
of parenting books,

06:09.400 --> 06:12.903
you know, to train
my mom and dad how to raise me
to be the perfect child.

06:12.903 --> 06:14.805
And what went wrong?
 Zip it, Fletcher!

06:16.577 --> 06:18.409
As I was saying,

06:18.409 --> 06:21.712
all the experts agree
that children need rules
to feel secure.

06:21.712 --> 06:25.456
So I've taken the liberty
of writing a little student
rule book for us.

06:26.156 --> 06:27.387
Dah!

06:29.389 --> 06:32.062
Olive, Mr. Grundy said we
don't need a rule book.

06:32.062 --> 06:34.394
No, what he said was,
there was no rule book,

06:34.394 --> 06:36.697
implying of course
that we should
write one ourselves.

06:37.167 --> 06:38.429
So behold:

06:38.429 --> 06:41.872
our "Ten Thousand
Commandments"!

06:41.872 --> 06:44.134
There are actually 13,629

06:44.134 --> 06:46.677
but "Ten Thousand
Commandments"

06:46.677 --> 06:47.908
has a better ring to it.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.614
Olive, these rules
are ridiculous.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.947
Yeah, like rule number 79:
"No eating with
your mouth open."

06:56.947 --> 06:58.489
How are we supposed
to get the food in there?

06:59.189 --> 07:01.492
See rule 80.

07:01.492 --> 07:06.056
"Rule 80: No asking
stupid questions,
Fletcher."

07:10.200 --> 07:12.132
Olive, you're
not the boss of us.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.004
We're not going
to follow your rules.

07:14.004 --> 07:16.607
Fine. You and Fletcher
can live in anarchy,

07:16.607 --> 07:19.910
and Angus and I
will live in civility,
and we'll see who does better.

07:19.910 --> 07:22.843
Wait. Why do I have
to follow the rules?

07:22.843 --> 07:26.146
Because you're madly in love
with me, and you'll do
whatever I tell you to.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.550
Right. (CHUCKLING)
What she said.

07:31.181 --> 07:33.824
Okay, Olive.
You want to throw
down the gauntlet?

07:33.824 --> 07:35.455
Let's throw
down the gauntlet.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.827
Sorry, but rule number 27

07:36.827 --> 07:38.659
strictly prohibits
the throwing of a gauntlet,

07:38.659 --> 07:40.460
a party, a football,
a javelin,

07:40.460 --> 07:42.493
a punch, a bone, a tantrum,
a banana cream pie,

07:42.493 --> 07:44.094
a monkey wrench into things,
a momma from a train,

07:44.094 --> 07:45.666
or a baby out
with the bath water.

07:46.897 --> 07:48.468
Aargh!

07:48.468 --> 07:49.940
Oh, and you also can't
throw your hands up
in frustration.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.742
Ugh!

07:57.978 --> 07:59.249
Check this out.

07:59.249 --> 08:02.182
Chad just texted me
a picture of him and Nicole,

08:02.182 --> 08:06.186
followed by a text that says,
"Sorry, I sent this
to you by accident."

08:06.186 --> 08:08.058
That is totes cray!

08:09.960 --> 08:12.523
Sorry to interrupt
your little party.

08:12.523 --> 08:13.964
Not as sorry as we are.

08:14.925 --> 08:16.066
(SING-SONG) Roasted!

08:17.197 --> 08:18.999
Mr. Grundy,

08:18.999 --> 08:22.072
we have a video conference
with Mr. Hashimoto
about the deal.

08:22.072 --> 08:25.235
Not now. Lexi and I need
to figure out what
to text back to Chad.

08:25.235 --> 08:27.778
How about
T-T-Y-N.

08:27.778 --> 08:29.079
Talk to you never.

08:29.079 --> 08:31.642
(MUMBLING)

08:31.642 --> 08:34.715
Sir, to set up
this call,

08:34.715 --> 08:38.818
I sent Mr. Hashimoto gifts
for 12 straight days.

08:38.818 --> 08:41.852
Do you know how much
it costs to ship a
partridge in a pear tree?

08:43.053 --> 08:44.254
We need to call him now.

08:45.095 --> 08:46.526
Okay.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.958
Are you nuts?

08:47.958 --> 08:51.231
You can't call him
again so soon. You'll
look totes desperate.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.133
What?

08:54.835 --> 08:57.037
Just wait like three days
before you call him.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.270
Ooh, and change
your relationship status
from "pursuing a deal"

09:00.270 --> 09:01.572
to "open to offers."

09:02.242 --> 09:04.775
That actually might work!

09:04.775 --> 09:08.048
I didn't realize that
business negotiations were
so much like dating!

09:08.048 --> 09:10.581
Probably because
I know absolutely
nothing about dating!

09:11.952 --> 09:14.084
We'll call Hashimoto
next week.

09:15.586 --> 09:17.688
Sir, are you going to listen

09:17.688 --> 09:20.731
to some self-obsessed
teenage girl,

09:20.731 --> 09:23.634
or to a self-obsessed
Harvard-trained
management major?

09:25.295 --> 09:26.967
If you majored
in management,

09:26.967 --> 09:29.770
you'd think you
could manage to put
a little makeup on.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.873
(SING SONG)
Microwaved!

09:34.605 --> 09:35.646
That's not a thing.

09:43.013 --> 09:44.985
And done.

09:46.056 --> 09:47.057
Ah!

09:50.621 --> 09:53.764
Okay, so lunch
is in five minutes,

09:53.764 --> 09:56.596
but to show Olive
we don't need
her stupid rules,

09:56.596 --> 09:59.329
I brought us a big snack
to spoil our appetites.

10:01.000 --> 10:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:09.109 --> 10:12.382
No, thanks.
I brought my own snack.

10:12.382 --> 10:13.613
Carrots?

10:15.946 --> 10:18.018
Do you know what
these will do to you?

10:18.018 --> 10:21.051
They'll improve your vision
and flush out harmful toxins!

10:21.051 --> 10:23.023
Your good behavior
is appalling.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.960
What do you think
you're doing?

10:29.960 --> 10:31.031
Do you know
what time it is?

10:31.401 --> 10:33.063
Hammer time?

10:41.842 --> 10:45.245
No, fifteen minutes
till lights out.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.017
Hammer time
was at 4:00,
you missed it.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.681
Did you finish your homework?
 Yes.

10:50.681 --> 10:51.882
Did you brush your teeth?
 Yes.

10:51.882 --> 10:52.923
Did you floss?
 Yes.

10:52.923 --> 10:54.725
Are you lying about all this?
 Yes.

10:58.428 --> 11:00.330
Okay, here is the plan.

11:00.330 --> 11:04.034
We take a picture
of you drinking
a competitor's soda

11:04.034 --> 11:06.737
and then "accidentally"
text it to Hashimoto.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.001
Okay, look like you
really love it.

11:18.248 --> 11:22.813
Lexi, may I talk to
you for a minute?

11:23.884 --> 11:26.116
I have a favor to ask.

11:26.116 --> 11:28.388
Sorry, there's nothing
I can do with your hair.

11:29.860 --> 11:33.864
I'll have you know
this hair went to Harvard.

11:33.864 --> 11:38.028
All of me did.
Uh, except my nose.
That was a graduation gift.

11:39.129 --> 11:42.973
Anyway,
I need you to stop
distracting Mr. Grundy.

11:43.774 --> 11:45.075
I understand.

11:45.075 --> 11:47.738
What you're saying is,
you're totes jelly.

11:48.138 --> 11:49.139
What?

11:51.081 --> 11:55.015
Sorry, I forgot you
only speak "old people."

11:55.015 --> 11:58.949
You're totally jealous
that Zoltan listens
to me and not you.

11:58.949 --> 12:00.050
Ha!

12:00.050 --> 12:02.823
I am not "totes jelly!"

12:02.823 --> 12:04.094
And I am not old!

12:04.094 --> 12:06.126
I have the complexion
of a one-year-old.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.099
Notice I didn't say newborn,
because let's be honest,

12:09.099 --> 12:10.931
newborns are disgusting.

12:12.462 --> 12:15.906
Winter is totes
jelly and bitter.

12:15.906 --> 12:19.840
We should make her
a peanut bitter
and jelly sandwich.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.742
And add a side order
of "hater" tots.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.444
BOTH: Ooh!

12:24.444 --> 12:25.816
(GASPS)

12:30.250 --> 12:33.423
Wow. Your room's
pretty messy.

12:33.423 --> 12:36.226
You're right.
I have to do
something about it.

12:39.329 --> 12:41.531
Because it has
to be super messy.

12:41.531 --> 12:44.795
Olive has to think we love
living without her rules,

12:44.795 --> 12:46.997
even though,
and this might
surprise you,

12:46.997 --> 12:50.170
pepperoni and ice cream
is a little tough on
the tum tum.

12:52.202 --> 12:54.504
Anyway, I appreciate
you not showering

12:54.504 --> 12:57.047
for three days
and smelling terrible.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.951
Yes, that's why I smell.

13:00.951 --> 13:03.814
To help contribute
to whatever it is
we're doing.

13:05.155 --> 13:08.418
If Olive thinks she's right,
she'll boss us around forever.

13:08.418 --> 13:10.821
We have to stand up
to her tyranny.

13:10.821 --> 13:13.864
Right!
What's tyranny again?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.900
What are you looking for?

13:19.900 --> 13:23.133
My flash drive.
It has all this music
I wrote on it!

13:24.104 --> 13:25.305
I can't find it anywhere!

13:29.039 --> 13:30.440
Hey, guys.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.415
Looking for something?

13:35.415 --> 13:38.989
Uh, no.
I have a system.

13:38.989 --> 13:42.092
I know exactly
where everything is.

13:42.092 --> 13:45.856
For instance,
here is my half-eaten burrito
from three days ago.

13:45.856 --> 13:48.398
Exactly where
I meant to put it...

13:48.398 --> 13:51.601
On my favorite dry-clean
only silk blouse.

13:51.601 --> 13:53.333
(CHUCKLES)

13:53.333 --> 13:56.506
That wouldn't have
happened if you'd
cleaned up the room.

13:56.506 --> 13:59.069
Are you kidding?
I did it on purpose!

13:59.069 --> 14:00.570
It looks so much better now.

14:00.570 --> 14:02.572
In fact, I'll make
matching pants.

14:04.474 --> 14:06.616
There! Super cute!

14:08.078 --> 14:09.079
Ugh.

14:12.983 --> 14:14.524
We have to find
that flash drive!

14:14.524 --> 14:16.386
Quick, help me clean up
so I can look for it!

14:16.386 --> 14:19.990
I'll put things away,
you just fold... Everything!

14:23.293 --> 14:24.995
What are you doing?

14:24.995 --> 14:26.997
Folding. I only had
a pair of twos.

14:37.307 --> 14:39.249
I can't live like
this anymore.

14:39.249 --> 14:42.282
Olive's right.
I like having
a clean room.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.114
I like going to sleep
at a reasonable hour.

14:44.114 --> 14:45.956
And I like carrots.
 I like carrots too!

14:45.956 --> 14:47.557
I am a weak, weak person.

14:49.459 --> 14:51.461
So I guess we tell
Olive she wins?

14:51.461 --> 14:53.463
(SIGHS) No way!

14:53.463 --> 14:55.365
If we admit to Olive
that we were wrong,

14:55.365 --> 14:58.328
her most common
phrase won't be
"interesting factoid,"

14:58.328 --> 14:59.970
it'll be "I told you so."

15:02.272 --> 15:05.175
Wow. What happened?

15:05.175 --> 15:07.637
Have you seen
the error of your ways?

15:07.637 --> 15:10.010
Interesting factoid:
I told you so.

15:12.142 --> 15:16.446
No, I didn't clean up because
you thought I should.

15:16.446 --> 15:19.319
I cleaned because...

15:19.319 --> 15:21.351
The new dorm supervisor
made me.

15:21.351 --> 15:23.293
There is a new dorm
supervisor?

15:23.293 --> 15:25.555
Who is it?
 Yeah, who is it?

15:25.555 --> 15:29.960
Uh, his name is...
Dorian Bannister.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.332
Dorian Bannister?

15:32.332 --> 15:36.306
Yeah. Mr. Grundy put him
in charge of supervising us,

15:36.306 --> 15:38.938
because apparently
not everyone

15:38.938 --> 15:40.640
is as able to handle
their independence

15:40.640 --> 15:43.313
as responsibly as I am.

15:43.313 --> 15:48.118
Oh, yeah and
the new rule is only
11 stuffed animals per bed.

15:49.719 --> 15:50.720
(SHRIEKS) No!

15:51.982 --> 15:53.353
Not the Dolly Llama!

15:56.426 --> 15:58.228
I want to talk to this
Bannister guy.

15:58.228 --> 16:00.090
What?

16:00.090 --> 16:02.162
Well, there's no way
his rules are
better than mine.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.965
Wait! You can't talk
to Bannister, because...

16:05.965 --> 16:09.069
Bannister's first rule
is no complaining
about his rules.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.370
Rats!

16:10.370 --> 16:12.342
Well played, Bannister.

16:15.305 --> 16:16.746
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

16:16.746 --> 16:18.608
Mr. Grundy,

16:18.608 --> 16:21.211
I have been trying
to get you
to focus all week.

16:21.211 --> 16:22.982
And now, thanks to her,

16:22.982 --> 16:25.285
the Hashimoto deal
is probably dead.

16:27.117 --> 16:30.360
(GASPS)
 Mr. Hashimoto?

16:30.360 --> 16:32.392
What a pleasant surprise!

16:32.392 --> 16:34.394
What is going on
between us?

16:34.394 --> 16:36.426
You don't call me
for three days,

16:36.426 --> 16:38.168
and you probably
do not know this,

16:38.168 --> 16:39.729
but you accidentally
sent me a text

16:39.729 --> 16:42.432
of you drinking
a competitor's soda.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.205
Did I? Oops.

16:47.577 --> 16:49.579
I just have one question.

16:49.579 --> 16:52.042
Oh, Harvard.
I went to Harvard.

16:53.743 --> 16:55.285
My question is,

16:55.285 --> 16:56.786
would you reconsider
the deal

16:56.786 --> 16:59.489
if I knock
a billion dollars
off the price?

17:01.321 --> 17:03.293
Is it me,
or is it desperate
in here?

17:05.425 --> 17:08.358
Yes! Yes, absolutely.
It's a deal!

17:08.358 --> 17:11.631
Excellent! Let us celebrate
our corporate matrimony

17:11.631 --> 17:14.564
by toasting with
some refreshing

17:14.564 --> 17:16.035
Hashimoto Soda.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.109
(FIZZING)

17:22.412 --> 17:24.042
ZOLTAN: Oh.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.444
What is this?

17:25.444 --> 17:28.318
It tastes
like squid mucous.

17:28.318 --> 17:30.550
How dare you insult
our most popular flavor:

17:31.421 --> 17:32.482
octopus mucous!

17:33.523 --> 17:36.256
You have dishonored
Hashimoto Soda!

17:36.256 --> 17:37.627
The deal is off!

17:37.627 --> 17:40.090
Ah! Godzilla! Not again!

17:41.060 --> 17:43.733
Mr. Grundy,
do something!

17:43.733 --> 17:46.366
Lexi! What do you do
when a boy is breaking
up with you?

17:46.366 --> 17:48.768
I don't know.
It's never happened
to me before.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.446
This Bannister idea
was genius!

17:56.446 --> 17:58.308
We can make up
any rules we want,

17:58.308 --> 18:02.081
blame them on
"Bannister," and Olive
has to follow them.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.083
I know. By the way,
I told Olive that Bannister

18:04.083 --> 18:05.785
outlawed
"interesting factoids"

18:05.785 --> 18:07.487
and pants
with flowers on them.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.818
(LAUGHING)

18:12.222 --> 18:14.424
I can't believe
Bannister and his rules.

18:14.424 --> 18:17.497
I had to borrow
these stupid flowerless
pants from Angus!

18:19.469 --> 18:22.372
And Bannister said
we had to stay up
until 9:00!

18:22.372 --> 18:23.873
Like rock and roll musicians!

18:25.875 --> 18:30.440
I barely slept ten hours.
I am slowly dying.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.342
Technically,
we're all slowly dying.

18:32.342 --> 18:34.314
I believe it's called aging.
 Zip it, Fletcher!

18:38.248 --> 18:40.850
I got to talk to
Bannister. Where is he?

18:40.850 --> 18:43.293
Um... I think
it's his day off,

18:43.293 --> 18:45.255
so I guess you're out of luck.

18:45.255 --> 18:46.826
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

18:46.826 --> 18:49.359
Never mind.
There's Mr. Grundy.
I'll talk to him instead.

18:49.359 --> 18:50.900
Wait...
 Mr. Grundy,

18:50.900 --> 18:53.663
how could you put
someone in charge
of us instead of me?

18:53.663 --> 18:55.265
You have crossed the line.

18:55.265 --> 18:58.137
Rule 27 be darned!
I'm throwing down a gauntlet!

19:01.871 --> 19:05.715
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

19:05.715 --> 19:07.317
But thank you
for finding my gauntlet.

19:08.478 --> 19:10.320
I've been looking
all over for it.

19:11.821 --> 19:14.454
So what you're saying is,

19:14.454 --> 19:18.728
somebody at your company
is making up their own rules?

19:18.728 --> 19:20.560
Without your permission?

19:20.560 --> 19:23.633
This is an outrage!
An outrage, I say!

19:23.633 --> 19:27.237
I don't know who's
responsible for this,
but I intend to find out.

19:27.237 --> 19:30.370
And when I do, I would
not want to be that person.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.343
Mostly because I like
being who I am, because
I'm a billionaire.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.807
It's Bannister!
He's run amok
with power!

19:37.807 --> 19:39.379
That's my job!

19:40.179 --> 19:41.180
Bannister?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.753
You have a big company.

19:43.753 --> 19:47.417
You can't be
expected to know all
the employees by name.

19:47.417 --> 19:49.819
I know exactly who he is.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.292
You do?
 (ELEVATOR DINGING)

19:53.893 --> 19:57.427
ZOLTAN: Bannister!
A word, please?

19:59.629 --> 20:00.930
Yes, sir?

20:00.930 --> 20:02.432
There's a real Bannister?

20:04.334 --> 20:05.575
Who do you think
you are, Bannister?

20:05.575 --> 20:08.308
Supervising these kids
without my approval?

20:08.308 --> 20:11.611
Yeah! What's wrong
with you? Outlawing
interesting factoids?

20:11.611 --> 20:13.843
I have had to use
uninteresting factoids
all day!

20:14.614 --> 20:16.516
Mr. Grundy, sir, I...

20:16.516 --> 20:18.418
I don't want to hear it!
Pack up your office,
Bannister.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.390
You're fired!
 What?

20:20.390 --> 20:23.953
But sir! I have a wife,
and five children,

20:23.953 --> 20:25.595
all named Zoltan!

20:27.857 --> 20:29.829
No excuses, Bannister!
Hit the bricks!

20:31.331 --> 20:33.333
Wait!

20:33.333 --> 20:34.834
Bannister
didn't do anything.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.367
Well, now he can not do
anything at home,

20:37.367 --> 20:39.238
because he ain't
working here anymore!

20:40.570 --> 20:44.814
Look, Mr. Grundy,
I can explain.

20:44.814 --> 20:47.246
I didn't want Olive
bossing us around,

20:47.246 --> 20:48.848
so I just told her
we were following rules

20:48.848 --> 20:50.850
made up
by some guy
named Bannister.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.782
I didn't know
there was actually
a real Bannister!

20:52.782 --> 20:54.624
Dorian Bannister
is just the fake name

20:54.624 --> 20:56.656
I use whenever
I need to invent someone!

20:56.656 --> 20:58.528
It's a condition I have.

20:58.528 --> 21:00.990
You should ask
my pediatrician,
Dr. Dorian Bannister.

21:02.892 --> 21:05.465
In that case, Bannister,
you can stay.

21:05.465 --> 21:08.338
But for goodness sake,
rename your children.

21:08.338 --> 21:11.701
Five Zoltans?
That's totes creepy.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.645
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

Stop groveling, Bannister,
and get back to work!

21:21.381 --> 21:23.413
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

21:23.413 --> 21:24.484
So you lied to me?

21:24.484 --> 21:27.457
(SIGHS) Look, Olive,
I'm sorry.

21:27.457 --> 21:29.759
I didn't want to admit it,
but we do need some rules.

21:29.759 --> 21:32.462
You were right. Again.

21:32.462 --> 21:35.294
I'm sorry too.
I kind of overdid it.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.526
Hey, what about me?

21:36.526 --> 21:37.997
This hasn't been
easy on me either.

a dreadful mistake.

21:59.349 --> 22:00.890
Maybe you should
get an applause sign.

22:02.722 --> 22:06.526
Turns out that children
do in fact need supervision,

22:06.526 --> 22:09.729
so I've created
a new position
at the school,

22:09.729 --> 22:12.632
the sole responsibility
of which will be to look after

22:12.632 --> 22:15.334
and nurture you Ants.

I wish I could do it
myself, but I don't want to.

to your new den mother,
Winter Maddox.

Mr. Grundy,

22:31.551 --> 22:33.583
I don't like children.

22:35.084 --> 22:38.057
I didn't even like myself
until I got into Harvard.

Did I mention,
I went to Harvard.

22:41.531 --> 22:43.493
I've made up my mind.

22:43.493 --> 22:46.436
Mr. Grundy, please...
 Sorry, I've got to run.

22:46.436 --> 22:48.468

22:56.476 --> 22:57.407
Oh.

Okay, I don't really know
the first thing about being
a den mother,

23:03.613 --> 23:07.056
so I did some research
by reading this
child rearing book.

23:07.056 --> 23:09.489
Granted, I only got
through the first chapter.

23:12.422 --> 23:14.924
Could you maybe jump
ahead to the chapter
on teenagers?

23:17.026 --> 23:20.670
Um, how long
