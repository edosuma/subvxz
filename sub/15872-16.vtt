00:00.176 --> 00:03.276
<i>A few months ago,
I discovered I had a twin sister.</i>

00:03.346 --> 00:05.546
<i>And then she asked me
to take her place.</i>

00:05.586 --> 00:06.798
<i>Keep the secret,</i>

00:06.799 --> 00:10.206
<i>find the real mother
and try to stay alive.</i>

00:10.334 --> 00:11.834
<i>Put yourself into my shoes:</i>

00:11.905 --> 00:15.574
<i>how long could you</i>
<i>keep up the lying game?</i>

00:15.609 --> 00:16.876
<i>Previously on</i> The Lying Game:

00:16.910 --> 00:19.612
<i>Just let me know</i>
<i>when you get tired of Mads.</i>

00:19.646 --> 00:20.713
You want to tell me
where you've been?

00:20.747 --> 00:21.981
I was at the
library with Sutton.

00:22.015 --> 00:24.650
Sutton called here
three hours ago looking for you.

00:24.684 --> 00:25.918
If you didn't want me
going out with Ryan,

00:25.952 --> 00:27.853
you should have just said so.

00:27.888 --> 00:29.955
You're the last person my mom or
dad wants me dating right now.

00:29.990 --> 00:31.790
I just don't like
sneaking around.

00:31.825 --> 00:32.825
Dad, this is Sutton.

00:32.859 --> 00:34.894
He just asked me
to be in his band.

00:34.928 --> 00:36.028
You go find Derek.

00:36.062 --> 00:37.730
-Emma...
-No, Sutton's right.

00:37.764 --> 00:39.598
She needs to be the one
to confront him.

00:39.633 --> 00:40.966
The night I went into the lake,
you tried to kill me.

00:41.001 --> 00:42.001
Who sent you?!

00:42.035 --> 00:45.037
(grunting)

00:45.071 --> 00:46.939
Come on, let's get
out of here right now.

00:46.973 --> 00:48.807
The other was beaten
to death last night.

00:48.842 --> 00:50.843
Tire iron, or some other
blunt object.

00:50.877 --> 00:52.745
You need to get out of town.

00:52.779 --> 00:53.846
If I run, they're going
to think I did it for sure.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.648
You don't have a choice!

00:55.682 --> 00:57.783
I was there. I can tell
the cops what happened.

00:57.817 --> 00:59.018
We can't make the switch.

00:59.052 --> 01:01.654
- Get out!
- No, I'm coming with you!

01:01.688 --> 01:02.688
Just go!

01:02.722 --> 01:04.822
(tires screech)

01:17.037 --> 01:18.938
SUTTON:
So...

01:19.231 --> 01:22.366
this is where you grew up?

01:22.401 --> 01:25.503
Are you sure it's safe
to hide here?

01:32.344 --> 01:35.479
And that man is...

01:37.055 --> 01:38.590
My father.

01:49.330 --> 01:50.464
Did you call my parents?

01:50.498 --> 01:52.399
Yeah, they're coming.

01:52.433 --> 01:55.369
Can you go and see
what's taking Larkin so long?

01:55.403 --> 01:58.138
I'll take her into the room.

01:58.415 --> 01:59.815
Come on.

02:02.277 --> 02:04.411
So obviously, they're going
to question you

02:04.445 --> 02:06.546
about the fight with
Derek and Ethan, so...

02:06.581 --> 02:08.582
Is Ethan being accused
of Derek's murder?

02:08.616 --> 02:11.718
- He didn't do it, Dan.
- I know.

02:11.753 --> 02:14.488
I know he didn't.

02:17.759 --> 02:19.559
Have a seat.

02:23.431 --> 02:25.815
It's true. I never believe
Ethan, but this time I do.

02:25.816 --> 02:27.978
I think he was set up, so
I got him out of town.

02:27.979 --> 02:28.635
Where is he?

02:28.670 --> 02:30.537
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

02:30.571 --> 02:32.606
But you're not to contact him,
do you understand me?

02:32.640 --> 02:34.574
You were the only one there
during the altercation

02:34.609 --> 02:37.444
between Ethan and Derek.
So whatever you say right now

02:37.478 --> 02:39.579
will either help him,
or put him behind bars.

02:39.614 --> 02:42.416
So just-just tell 'em
exactly what you saw.

02:42.450 --> 02:43.750
That's it. No more. Okay?

02:52.460 --> 02:53.427
I'm Detective Larkin.

02:53.461 --> 02:56.730
This is Officer Sanchez.

02:56.764 --> 02:59.399
Your parents are on their way.

02:59.434 --> 03:00.701
You being a minor,
you have the right

03:00.735 --> 03:02.636
to have one of them
back here with you.

03:02.670 --> 03:05.505
You're not a person
of interest, but you are

03:05.540 --> 03:07.374
a potential witness
to a crime.

03:07.408 --> 03:11.378
It's up to you.

03:11.412 --> 03:13.313
Ah... it's fine.

03:17.585 --> 03:19.419
Sutton, I'm going to ask
you a few questions,

03:19.454 --> 03:21.388
but why don't you start
off by walking me through

03:21.422 --> 03:22.656
everything that
happened last night.

03:22.690 --> 03:26.360
Right. Everything...

03:26.394 --> 03:28.495
that happened...

03:28.529 --> 03:32.432
Where do I begin?

03:32.968 --> 03:35.768

and any of your son's
friends at the school.

03:56.691 --> 03:57.681
He's one of the kids

03:57.682 --> 03:59.760
who came to my house
asking about Derek.

03:59.794 --> 04:02.329
- Mrs. Rogers, are you sure?
- Yes!

04:02.363 --> 04:03.463
THAYER: We're friends of
Char's and Derek's.

04:03.498 --> 04:04.698
We were just worried about him.

04:04.732 --> 04:06.332
Okay? That's why we stopped by.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.467
ALEC: Mr. Rogers...

04:07.502 --> 04:11.338
Alec Rybak, we met once before
when I was helping Derek.

04:11.372 --> 04:13.391
I'm very sorry for your loss.

04:13.392 --> 04:15.409
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Rybak.

04:15.443 --> 04:17.277
I want you to know we're going
to do everything we can

04:17.310 --> 04:18.512
to get to the bottom
of this, all right?

04:18.546 --> 04:20.514
Harry, why don't you escort
Mrs. Rogers to her vehicle.

04:20.548 --> 04:22.349
If you can think
of anything,

04:22.383 --> 04:24.251
or there's anything you want
to talk to me about,

04:24.285 --> 04:25.352
please give me a call.

04:25.386 --> 04:27.721
Thank you.

04:29.724 --> 04:33.260
So... did I hear right?

04:33.294 --> 04:35.395
You went to her house?

04:35.430 --> 04:36.496
- With...
- Sutton.

04:36.531 --> 04:40.400
And Ethan, but it was only because
Char wanted us to check on Derek.

04:40.435 --> 04:43.770
You better hope to God you've
got nothing to do with this.

04:48.576 --> 04:52.546
After, yeah, it was
after the fight.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.514
Why did the police officer
pull you over?

04:57.351 --> 04:58.618
We were... we were speeding.

04:58.653 --> 05:00.687
We were going faster
than the speed limit.

05:00.721 --> 05:02.522
Not according to
the officer's notes.

05:02.557 --> 05:04.424
Here it says that
Ethan was pulled over

05:04.459 --> 05:07.260
because of a broken
left back tail light.

05:07.295 --> 05:10.497
Right, yeah, well,
I thought... Uh...

05:12.500 --> 05:15.635
He noticed it after
he pulled us over for speeding.

05:15.670 --> 05:16.636
Okay.

05:16.671 --> 05:19.639
Let's go back to the fight.

05:19.674 --> 05:22.676
Did either Ethan
or Derek use a weapon?

05:22.710 --> 05:25.512
No... Ethan didn't.

05:25.546 --> 05:26.546
What about Derek?

05:26.581 --> 05:30.650
Uh, w... what are those...

05:30.685 --> 05:32.552
those things called?

05:32.587 --> 05:35.288
I... sorry, I'm
blanking on the...

05:35.323 --> 05:36.490
A tire iron?

05:36.524 --> 05:39.259
Yes!
Yes...

05:39.293 --> 05:40.727
Did Derek use that
against Ethan?

05:40.761 --> 05:44.297
Yes, that's why Ethan hit him.

05:44.332 --> 05:47.734
How many times did he hit him?
Five, ten, more maybe?

05:47.768 --> 05:48.735
(whispers):
Uh, one...

05:48.769 --> 05:51.338
Once.
Ethan hit him once.

05:51.372 --> 05:53.340
Once?

05:53.374 --> 05:56.743
Mm-hmm.

05:56.777 --> 05:59.646
SUTTON: I mean, this is
really kind of exciting.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.282
Plus, it's like
we're fugitives on the run.

06:02.316 --> 06:05.552
What's that movie, uh, where
they rob a bank?

06:05.586 --> 06:07.320
<i>Bonnie and Clyde?</i>

06:07.355 --> 06:08.321
Yes.

06:08.356 --> 06:09.689
<i>Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

06:09.724 --> 06:12.492
Sutton, they get shot up in a
hail of bullets at the end.

06:12.527 --> 06:14.728
Oh. Well...
(squish)

06:16.430 --> 06:17.631
(whines)
It's not quicksand.

06:17.665 --> 06:20.333
Okay?
Just pull your foot out.

06:20.368 --> 06:25.305
Who said four-inch heels
were impractical.

06:25.339 --> 06:27.674
Ew!

06:29.377 --> 06:30.710
Well...

06:32.713 --> 06:35.348
Either you're here to introduce
me to your new girl,

06:35.383 --> 06:37.484
or you're running from trouble.

06:38.719 --> 06:40.554
I'm going to go with trouble.

06:42.290 --> 06:44.591
This is Sutton,
a friend of mine.

06:46.427 --> 06:48.495
- Yeah, I am in some trouble.
- But it's not his fault.

06:48.529 --> 06:51.264
It never is.

06:51.299 --> 06:52.599
Right, Ethan?

06:54.635 --> 06:57.504
It looks like you could use
a little help around here.

06:57.538 --> 06:59.272
Yeah, well,
I wasn't going to let you

06:59.307 --> 07:00.273
sit around here on your ass.

07:01.542 --> 07:04.344
Wash 'em down.

07:04.378 --> 07:06.246
The girl can help.

07:09.483 --> 07:12.252
So, where are the horse showers?

07:12.286 --> 07:15.522
(horse neighs)

07:15.556 --> 07:16.346
Alec, where's Sutton?

07:16.347 --> 07:17.624
I want to see her. Is she okay?

07:17.658 --> 07:19.085
Do we have to get her a lawyer?

07:19.086 --> 07:20.327
No, no, she's all right.

07:20.361 --> 07:22.229
They're just asking
her some questions.

07:22.263 --> 07:23.496
I'd be in there right now
with her if I could,

07:23.531 --> 07:24.698
but it's strictly
police business.

07:24.732 --> 07:27.500
Sutton was in her bedroom last
night, studying for midterms.

07:27.535 --> 07:30.337
- At what time?
- Well, I don't know.

07:30.371 --> 07:32.339
She had dinner with us, then
she met Mads at the library.

07:32.373 --> 07:33.540
TED: But no, but then
she came home early,

07:33.574 --> 07:35.442
because she said
Mads never showed.

07:35.476 --> 07:37.277
Yeah, Mads was spinning
some lies of her own.

07:37.311 --> 07:39.312
She snuck out of the
house last night

07:39.347 --> 07:40.680
to see a band
with that Ryan guy.

07:40.715 --> 07:42.716
She told me she was going to the
library with Sutton to study,

07:42.750 --> 07:44.384
and I believed her until
Sutton called the house

07:44.418 --> 07:45.685
looking for her.

07:45.720 --> 07:48.288
Did you actually see Sutton
in her room last night?

07:48.322 --> 07:50.457
Yeah, around 9:00.
I brought her a snack.

07:50.491 --> 07:51.725
The police pulled them
over just before 9:00.

07:51.759 --> 07:53.293
That's impossible.

07:53.327 --> 07:54.561
Well, I thought
that's when I went in.

07:54.595 --> 07:57.330
I don't, I don't know anymore.

07:57.365 --> 07:58.632
Well, I saw her
when she got back.

07:58.666 --> 08:00.500
And her light was on
most of the night.

08:00.534 --> 08:03.670
Look, honey, it wouldn't be the
first time Sutton snuck out.

08:03.704 --> 08:05.472
Guys, really, I think we're
just dealing with a case

08:05.506 --> 08:08.642
of being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

08:08.676 --> 08:11.678
Sutton, honey...

08:11.712 --> 08:13.513
You okay?

08:13.547 --> 08:15.382
Boy, that Ethan Whitehorse, huh?

08:15.416 --> 08:18.485
What a stand-up guy, leaving
her alone at a time like this.

08:18.519 --> 08:20.620
Mm. Have any idea
where he is?

08:20.655 --> 08:24.224
I'll find him.

08:24.258 --> 08:27.360
This is just so weird, and
Sutton getting arrested.

08:28.629 --> 08:29.663
Okay.

08:29.697 --> 08:31.598
What is this?

08:31.632 --> 08:33.232
You haven't said a word
since this happened.

08:33.267 --> 08:34.501
Do you think Sutton had
something to do with it?

08:34.534 --> 08:37.504
It wouldn't surprise me.

08:37.538 --> 08:39.673
Come on...

08:39.707 --> 08:42.375
I know you guys
aren't exactly chums.

08:42.409 --> 08:44.311
What's she been to you, Mads?

08:44.345 --> 08:47.314
She went out of her way
to bust you the other night

08:47.348 --> 08:49.449
with that study date ruse.

08:49.483 --> 08:51.384
Let's not forget
her lying games.

08:55.389 --> 08:57.223
Can I help?

08:57.258 --> 08:59.526
Have you ever been
around horses?

08:59.560 --> 09:02.562
Of course.

09:05.366 --> 09:06.466
(horse snorts)

09:06.500 --> 09:09.469
(whimpers)
(laughs)

09:09.503 --> 09:10.503
It's not funny!

09:10.538 --> 09:12.505
He bit my finger!

09:12.540 --> 09:14.174
What, this guy?

09:14.208 --> 09:16.309
Yes.
No, come on.

09:16.344 --> 09:18.345
Look at this, this is
Teddybear right here.

09:18.379 --> 09:19.546
He's all Teddy, no bear.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.414
(nervous laugh)

09:21.449 --> 09:23.350
Look, basic rule when you're
dealing with horses,

09:23.384 --> 09:25.285
you want to keep your fingers
away from their mouth, okay?

09:25.319 --> 09:28.488
Keep your hand flat,
fingers out, like that.

09:28.522 --> 09:29.522
Want to try it again?

09:29.557 --> 09:32.325
Come on.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.393
Look, he'll be your
friend for life.

09:33.427 --> 09:34.494
Okay...

09:37.231 --> 09:40.467
(horse snorting)

09:40.501 --> 09:43.269
(giggles)

09:43.304 --> 09:44.704
See?

09:49.343 --> 09:50.510
You love them, don't you?

09:50.544 --> 09:52.679
Horses?

09:52.713 --> 09:56.516
Yeah, I do.

09:56.550 --> 10:00.286
I guess because with them, you
always know where you stand.

10:00.321 --> 10:03.356
All right, we're done here.

10:03.391 --> 10:06.526
Let's go inside.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.528
Or...

10:10.331 --> 10:12.298
We can go out.

10:12.333 --> 10:15.535
I'm sure there's tons of fun
stuff to do around here.

10:15.569 --> 10:18.304
Hey! This isn't
a vacation, okay?!

10:18.339 --> 10:20.373
I'm wanted for murder right now.

10:20.408 --> 10:22.542
I had to leave Emma
back there, alone!

10:23.577 --> 10:25.612
(sighs)

10:31.916 --> 10:36.316
Was Derek dead
when you left the garage?

10:36.603 --> 10:39.004
No. Derek... was alive.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.340
Ethan, he didn't kill Derek,
he was defending himself.

10:41.381 --> 10:43.082
LARKIN: Just defending himself?

10:43.116 --> 10:45.184
You see the way she's
answering these questions?

10:45.218 --> 10:47.353
It's almost like
she wasn't there at all.

10:47.387 --> 10:50.189
But she readily
admits that she was.

10:50.223 --> 10:51.991
That could only mean one thing:

10:52.025 --> 10:53.425
that she's lying
about all of it.

10:53.460 --> 10:54.534
Kid was nervous, Alec.

10:54.535 --> 10:56.095
Wouldn't you be nervous, too,

10:56.129 --> 10:57.396
if you just watched
your boyfriend

10:57.430 --> 10:59.031
kill somebody in cold blood?

10:59.065 --> 11:00.900
Come on,
we don't know that.

11:01.087 --> 11:02.888
Look. See that?

11:02.922 --> 11:04.189
Every time she answers
a question, she looks up

11:04.224 --> 11:06.325
and to the right--
when you're accessing

11:06.359 --> 11:09.027
a true memory, people look up
and to the left.

11:09.029 --> 11:11.230
Lying is to the right; I don't
think she's looked left once.

11:11.264 --> 11:13.165
I don't know,
I wasn't in the room.

11:13.199 --> 11:16.134
But you <i>were</i> with her

11:16.169 --> 11:17.869
before Larkin
got there, right?

11:17.904 --> 11:19.905
I took her to the room,
that's all.

11:19.939 --> 11:21.173
Mm-hmm. So, theoretically,
you would have had

11:21.207 --> 11:23.075
enough time to... prep her

11:23.109 --> 11:25.911
on what to say before
Larkin took over.

11:25.945 --> 11:27.913
I mean, Dan,
come on, let's face it.

11:27.947 --> 11:29.214
You both have a vested interest

11:29.249 --> 11:31.016
in making Ethan look
innocent, don't you?

11:31.050 --> 11:32.918
Lay off it, Alec--
you know I wouldn't do that.

11:32.952 --> 11:34.286
Do I?

11:36.022 --> 11:37.289
Where is he, Dan?

11:37.323 --> 11:39.958
Where did he go?

11:39.993 --> 11:42.227
I have no idea.

11:47.033 --> 11:50.769
You better find him...
and find him soon,

11:50.803 --> 11:52.871
or it's your ass, too.

11:59.879 --> 12:01.813
So...

12:01.848 --> 12:05.717
you gonna tell me
what this trouble is?

12:05.752 --> 12:06.952
(sighs)

12:06.986 --> 12:08.954
I didn't do anything.

12:08.988 --> 12:10.889
I was set up.

12:10.924 --> 12:12.124
(laughs softly)

12:12.158 --> 12:14.860
You know, for a kid
that never does anything,

12:14.894 --> 12:16.929
you sure get in
a lot of trouble.

12:16.963 --> 12:18.163
(footsteps approaching)

12:21.100 --> 12:23.802
SUTTON: Is...
something wrong?

12:23.836 --> 12:25.170
Where'd you get those clothes?

12:25.205 --> 12:28.040
Oh, I found them
in the guest room.

12:28.074 --> 12:30.776
Put them back.

12:32.812 --> 12:34.213
I'm confused.

12:34.247 --> 12:36.748
Those were my mom's clothes.

12:36.783 --> 12:38.884
Oh, God, she didn't,
like, die in them...

12:38.918 --> 12:41.153
No. She's still alive.

12:41.187 --> 12:43.989
She left when I was 13.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.160
How did I not know this?

12:48.194 --> 12:50.963
'Cause you never asked.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.719
KRISTIN: You have got to stop
covering for that boy Sutton.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.467
This isn't joy rides,
stolen laptops.

12:58.468 --> 12:58.904
Honey,

12:58.938 --> 13:00.772
a classmate of
yours is dead.

13:00.807 --> 13:01.873
It was a <i>fight.</i>

13:01.908 --> 13:03.075
Ethan didn't <i>kill</i> him.

13:03.109 --> 13:05.010
Char is one of
my best friends.

13:05.044 --> 13:07.112
Do you honestly believe
that I would watch Ethan

13:07.146 --> 13:08.462
kill her boyfriend?

13:08.463 --> 13:10.716
Okay, enough, enough for now.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.150
But we're not through
talking about this.

13:12.185 --> 13:14.152
Wait. Come here.

13:16.990 --> 13:18.924
We love you so much.

13:18.958 --> 13:20.926
You know you can
tell us anything.

13:21.961 --> 13:23.061
I know.

13:23.096 --> 13:24.730
Good night.

13:24.764 --> 13:26.898
G'night.

13:26.933 --> 13:28.076
How could he do this to her?

13:28.077 --> 13:31.803
I mean, regardless if he's guilty or
innocent, leaving her like this...

13:31.838 --> 13:34.006
I'll tell you one thing, if
he ever does come back to town,

13:34.040 --> 13:35.774
he's not stepping foot
in this house again,

13:35.808 --> 13:37.075
and he's certainly
not seeing Sutton again.

13:37.110 --> 13:38.910
(doorbell chimes)

13:41.748 --> 13:43.048
Hey, guys.
Come in.

13:43.082 --> 13:44.850
Hey.
Hey.

13:44.884 --> 13:47.085
We just wanted to check
on Sutton, make sure she's okay.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.118
Well, that's nice of you,

13:48.119 --> 13:50.155
but there's no socializing
for Sutton right now.

13:50.189 --> 13:52.057
Do you guys know
anything about this?

13:52.091 --> 13:52.671
No.

13:52.672 --> 13:54.993
Only what we heard at
the police station.

13:55.028 --> 13:55.528
Police station.

13:55.529 --> 13:57.162
How do you know she was
at the police station?

13:57.196 --> 13:59.931
I heard my dad on the phone.

13:59.966 --> 14:01.833
KRISTIN: Well, did you hear him
say anything else?

14:01.868 --> 14:03.835
- THAYER: Not much.
- MADS: Is she all right?

14:03.870 --> 14:05.804
KRISTIN: Well, do you
know what happened tonight?

14:05.838 --> 14:08.006
TED:
Do you have any idea
where Ethan is?

14:08.041 --> 14:09.841
(door opens)

14:09.876 --> 14:11.777
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't want
to eavesdrop

14:11.811 --> 14:13.679
on you eavesdropping,
but I've been dying

14:13.713 --> 14:15.080
to talk to you all day.

14:15.114 --> 14:17.115
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

14:19.686 --> 14:20.786
No.

14:20.820 --> 14:22.020
I don't know.

14:22.055 --> 14:24.856
Did I hear
Thayer out there?

14:24.891 --> 14:26.625
Yeah, him and Mads.

14:26.659 --> 14:27.693
(sighs heavily)

14:27.727 --> 14:29.628
Mom and Dad
won't let me talk to them.

14:29.662 --> 14:30.862
Yeah.
I have a feeling

14:30.897 --> 14:32.964
you're gonna be on
lockdown for a while.

14:32.999 --> 14:34.700
(wry chuckle)

14:34.734 --> 14:36.668
Well, you've got me.

14:36.703 --> 14:38.870
I know.

14:38.905 --> 14:40.639
Do you?

14:40.673 --> 14:42.641
It's just that...

14:42.675 --> 14:44.743
lately I feel like
you've kind of been,

14:44.777 --> 14:46.044
you know, a little
more distant...

14:46.079 --> 14:47.979
(sighs):
I know.

14:48.014 --> 14:50.716
(quietly):
I'm sorry.

14:52.018 --> 14:53.952
Well, you're the strongest person I know,

14:53.986 --> 14:56.121
because if this was happening
to me right now,

14:56.155 --> 14:59.624
I'd be... crying my eyes out.

15:00.793 --> 15:02.994
I just can't let myself.

15:04.030 --> 15:06.598
You can with me.

15:06.632 --> 15:08.800
♪

15:14.974 --> 15:18.009
So, thank you
for taking me shopping.

15:18.044 --> 15:20.612
I'll get out of
these clothes and...

15:20.646 --> 15:22.914
put them back where
I found them.

15:22.949 --> 15:24.683
Hey, Ethan.

15:26.652 --> 15:28.787
I'm really sorry.

15:29.922 --> 15:31.022
It's okay.

15:31.057 --> 15:32.824
You didn't know.

15:32.859 --> 15:35.927
No, I-I mean for being...

15:35.962 --> 15:38.663
such a horrible girlfriend.

15:38.698 --> 15:39.765
You know...

15:39.799 --> 15:42.000
back in the day,
before Emma arrived.

15:43.936 --> 15:46.705
It wasn't all bad.

15:46.739 --> 15:49.007
Really?

15:49.041 --> 15:52.644
Yeah. And... now it's my turn
to apologize.

15:52.678 --> 15:54.613
I know the
shopping options

15:54.647 --> 15:55.881
on the rez are pretty limited,

15:55.915 --> 15:57.082
and you're probably
used to some,

15:57.116 --> 15:58.984
- like, mega...
- Wait a minute.

15:59.018 --> 16:01.853
What do you think, I'm some
sort of spoiled princess?

16:01.888 --> 16:05.657
I can totally
be down to earth.

16:05.691 --> 16:07.025
Uh-huh. Yeah.

16:07.059 --> 16:10.629
Uh-huh. Do you remember
the school camping trip?

16:10.663 --> 16:11.997
I wore down

16:12.031 --> 16:16.802
and plaid and hiking boots,
like everybody else.

16:16.836 --> 16:19.971
As I recall, you also plugged
the flatiron into the generator,

16:20.006 --> 16:21.673
taking out power

16:21.707 --> 16:23.842
for everybody else.

16:23.876 --> 16:25.644
Yeah.

16:25.678 --> 16:27.913
But...

16:27.947 --> 16:32.651
do you remember what we did
<i>after</i> the power went out?

16:38.090 --> 16:41.059
You go ahead
and take the guest bedroom.

I got to exercise

You okay?

what happened to Derek.

17:42.126 --> 17:43.993
I hit him. He fell.

17:44.027 --> 17:45.762
But you didn't kill him.

17:45.796 --> 17:46.996
I was there, Ethan.

17:47.030 --> 17:48.698
He was breathing.

17:48.732 --> 17:49.966
He was alive.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.934
Then who did kill him?

17:51.969 --> 17:56.706
Obviously, the same person that
told him to get into my car.

17:56.740 --> 17:58.741
And who wrote the note.

17:58.776 --> 18:00.676
Well, Derek, almost
told us who it was.

18:00.711 --> 18:01.938
And they must have known that.

18:01.939 --> 18:04.647
And they followed us up there...

18:04.681 --> 18:06.916
and they killed him.

18:06.950 --> 18:09.819
I may never be able to go home.

isn't like a pony ride

18:21.932 --> 18:23.900
at the county fair, okay?

18:23.934 --> 18:25.968
Oh, come on.

18:26.003 --> 18:28.004

18:59.736 --> 19:00.970
All right, let me
saddle this guy up.

19:01.004 --> 19:02.772
We'll take him up there,

No, it's not that.

20:07.838 --> 20:09.138
Come in.

20:09.172 --> 20:10.973
SUTTON:
You might want to see

20:11.008 --> 20:13.809
these midterm grades-- they
were posted this morning.

20:13.844 --> 20:15.111
I am really

20:15.145 --> 20:17.179
taking school seriously.

20:17.214 --> 20:19.483
Hey, Baz.
What are you doing here so early?

20:19.484 --> 20:22.425
Hey. I just, uh, printed up some
fliers for the show on Saturday.

20:22.426 --> 20:24.820
I've already told him I
won't be able to go now.

20:24.855 --> 20:26.122
Why? Because of me?

20:26.156 --> 20:28.224
Kind of. It's just,
I know we have...

20:28.258 --> 20:30.126
bigger things on
our minds than this.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.128
No. Laurel, you have to.

20:32.162 --> 20:34.163
Sutton's right;
this is important.

20:34.197 --> 20:36.866
I am going to frame this.

20:38.068 --> 20:39.835
Yeah.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.103
Thanks.

20:41.138 --> 20:42.838
Sutton, do you want
to ride with Baz?

20:42.873 --> 20:43.873
No, that's okay.

20:43.907 --> 20:45.041
I'll, uh, drive myself.

20:45.075 --> 20:46.842
But I'll meet you
after school?

20:46.877 --> 20:49.011
- Okay. See you.
- See you.

20:49.046 --> 20:51.113
- Thank you.
- Bye, hon. Yep.

20:53.116 --> 20:55.184
Wow. This is a first.

20:55.218 --> 20:56.852
What?

20:56.887 --> 21:00.756
Look at this. Midterm grades--
she got all A's?

21:00.791 --> 21:02.758
Don't you find this
a little odd?

21:02.793 --> 21:05.094
She aced her midterms
the morning after she watched

21:05.128 --> 21:07.730
her boyfriend commit a murder?

21:07.764 --> 21:10.199
Think she's telling
the truth, Ted.

21:15.105 --> 21:16.772
Mads.

21:16.807 --> 21:19.008
(sighs)

21:21.044 --> 21:22.778
I can't stay mad at you

21:22.813 --> 21:23.846
with all that's going on.

21:23.880 --> 21:24.847
Are you okay?

21:24.881 --> 21:27.116
It's crazy, but...

21:27.150 --> 21:29.218
More importantly, how is Char?

21:29.252 --> 21:31.787
(sighs) Do you have
any idea what it's like

21:31.822 --> 21:33.155
to call one of your best friends

21:33.190 --> 21:35.224
and tell her that
her boyfriend is dead?

21:35.258 --> 21:38.794
And she's devastated
that she can't come to his funeral.

21:38.829 --> 21:40.129
Yeah, it's horrible.

21:40.163 --> 21:43.833
I mean, the whole thing
is just horrible.

21:44.835 --> 21:47.169
You're... not involved

21:47.204 --> 21:48.938
in this, right?

21:48.972 --> 21:50.806
No.    <i>No.</i>

21:50.841 --> 21:53.976
So that wasn't why
you called my dad?

21:54.011 --> 21:55.244
To have your own alibi?

21:55.278 --> 21:58.047
Wait, you mean
when I was waiting for you

21:58.081 --> 21:59.181
at the library?

21:59.216 --> 22:01.083
(laughs softly)

22:01.118 --> 22:03.119
Look, don't play dumb with me.

22:03.153 --> 22:04.887
No. I...

22:04.921 --> 22:07.156
What is this,
another lying game?

22:07.190 --> 22:09.825
I guess
Ryan was right about you.

22:18.168 --> 22:20.770
All right.

22:20.804 --> 22:22.104
We can break
for lunch now.

22:22.139 --> 22:24.774
Take 'em out
for some more riding later,

22:24.808 --> 22:26.042
unless you're too sore.

22:26.076 --> 22:27.877
No. No.

22:27.911 --> 22:30.046
Couple of physical
therapy sessions,

22:30.080 --> 22:32.048
and I should be just fine.

22:32.082 --> 22:34.950
(scoffs)

22:34.985 --> 22:37.820
Hey, what's the
deal with your dad?

22:37.854 --> 22:40.056
He's so awful to you.

22:42.859 --> 22:45.061
He blames me
for my mom leaving.

22:46.997 --> 22:49.932
A while back, I was running
with a pretty bad crowd.

22:51.234 --> 22:53.903
And on a dare,
I hotwired a car,

22:53.937 --> 22:55.938
I got caught.

22:55.972 --> 22:58.174
They sent me to juvie.

22:59.910 --> 23:02.845
Three months later,
when I got out, my mom was gone.

23:04.815 --> 23:06.982
I guess that's why she left.

23:11.121 --> 23:13.722
We're looking for your son:
Ethan Whitehorse.

23:13.757 --> 23:15.891
And what's he done this time?

23:15.926 --> 23:17.960
He's wanted for murder, Ben.

23:19.996 --> 23:21.097
Murder.

23:21.131 --> 23:23.165
OFFICER: Yeah. Have you
heard from him?

23:23.200 --> 23:24.967
Have you seen him?

23:25.001 --> 23:27.575
BEN: I haven't seen
either of my sons

23:27.576 --> 23:29.138
since they left four years ago.

23:29.172 --> 23:32.908
Not a call, not
a Christmas card,

23:32.943 --> 23:34.844
and that's the way I like it.

23:34.878 --> 23:36.879
'Cause I don't want
any damn trouble,

23:36.913 --> 23:38.981
which is why I kicked them out
in the first place.

23:39.015 --> 23:41.984
So, you go on,
search the place.

23:42.018 --> 23:44.820
You find him,
you're welcome to him.

23:48.125 --> 23:49.992
All right.

23:50.026 --> 23:51.927
Sorry to have
to bother you, Ben.

23:51.962 --> 23:54.196
Yeah.

23:59.102 --> 24:00.903
(car doors close,
engine starts)

24:00.937 --> 24:02.104
Wait.

24:16.820 --> 24:17.987
What did they say?

24:18.021 --> 24:20.823
Doesn't matter.

24:20.857 --> 24:23.926
At the end of the week,
I want you gone.

24:25.996 --> 24:28.764
Both of you.

24:36.536 --> 24:38.270
- "You're The One That I Want."
- Yeah.

24:38.304 --> 24:39.571
Yeah, 'cause that's
what I was thinking.

24:39.606 --> 24:41.774
Then we can start off
with a traditional cover.

24:41.808 --> 24:43.446
Then maybe sort
of end the set...

24:43.447 --> 24:44.376
Justin...

24:44.511 --> 24:46.245
Remember Baz?

24:46.279 --> 24:49.314
(clears throat)
Hey, man.

24:49.349 --> 24:52.451
We were just going over
the set list for Saturday.

24:52.485 --> 24:54.553
Great. Can't wait to see it.

24:54.587 --> 24:56.355
Sweet.

24:56.389 --> 24:58.090
All right, later.

24:58.124 --> 25:00.392
Practice at
Owen's tonight.

25:00.427 --> 25:02.494
This show's gonna be boss.

25:02.529 --> 25:04.329
Boss?

25:04.364 --> 25:06.598
Is that a Baz term?

25:08.401 --> 25:11.203
Did you guys come
to school together?

25:11.237 --> 25:14.173
He thought that with everything
that's going on with Sutton,

25:14.207 --> 25:16.275
that I might
need a ride, so...

25:16.309 --> 25:18.444
I wasn't even supposed
to be in the show.

25:18.478 --> 25:21.280
Just, my parents
wanted me to do it.

25:21.314 --> 25:23.148
What are those?

25:23.183 --> 25:24.416
Flyers.

25:24.451 --> 25:26.185
I'm totally geeking out today

25:26.219 --> 25:27.519
and handing them
out to everyone.

25:27.554 --> 25:29.062
For the first time ever,

25:29.063 --> 25:31.323
I actually want
people to hear me.

25:33.493 --> 25:36.295
Ryan?

25:36.329 --> 25:38.430
Ryan?

25:38.465 --> 25:40.299
What?

25:40.333 --> 25:43.135
What have you been
telling Mads about me?

25:43.169 --> 25:44.470
I've got to get to class.

25:44.504 --> 25:47.539
Okay, wait. Please?

25:47.574 --> 25:49.608
I mean, isn't
whatever happened

25:49.642 --> 25:52.211
in ninth grade, like,
ancient history by now?

25:52.245 --> 25:54.146
I don't consider what happened

25:54.180 --> 25:56.615
at the Black and White Ball
ancient history.

25:56.649 --> 25:58.417
Right.

25:58.451 --> 26:00.419
Black and White Ball.

26:00.453 --> 26:03.122
So now you're going to pretend
you don't remember?

26:03.156 --> 26:06.391
You are unbelievable,
you know that?

26:12.398 --> 26:15.534
(organ plays solemn music)

26:17.170 --> 26:19.571
(crying)

26:43.496 --> 26:46.298
Tragedy, huh?

26:46.332 --> 26:48.333
He didn't even make it to 18.

26:49.602 --> 26:51.603
Yeah.

26:51.638 --> 26:55.140
You did a lot for Derek.

26:55.175 --> 26:57.342
Apparently not enough.

26:59.279 --> 27:01.480
He did stuff for
you, too, right?

27:06.352 --> 27:09.154
I might not sure I understand
what you're talking about.

27:09.189 --> 27:10.582
I'm just saying...

27:10.583 --> 27:14.226
I'm just saying, be careful what
you accuse me of, young lady.

27:16.329 --> 27:19.565
Let me ask you
a question, Sutton.

27:19.599 --> 27:22.534
What was Derek wearing
the night of the fight?

27:24.337 --> 27:25.571
I don't know.

27:25.605 --> 27:28.473
It was dark.

27:28.508 --> 27:31.276
Well, yeah, sure,
it was hard to see,

27:31.311 --> 27:33.178
and the lights
were out and all.

27:33.213 --> 27:37.216
I didn't say that
the lights were out.

27:37.250 --> 27:41.186
I mean, they were
low... I think.

27:41.221 --> 27:43.455
You think?

27:46.626 --> 27:50.462
I'm always suspicious of someone
with a selective memory.

27:53.233 --> 27:55.400
Ethan didn't kill Derek.

27:55.435 --> 27:57.036
You and Detective Larkin

27:57.037 --> 28:00.239
need to be looking for
the car that pulled up.

28:01.507 --> 28:03.308
Sutton...

28:03.343 --> 28:05.277
I think you've got me all wrong.

28:05.311 --> 28:07.479
I don't think Ethan did it,
either.

28:07.513 --> 28:10.082
It's just too bad
that he can't be here

28:10.116 --> 28:12.084
to share
his side of the story.

28:12.118 --> 28:14.486
You know, I'd hate to think that
he's gonna be on the run

28:14.520 --> 28:16.355
for the rest of his life

28:16.389 --> 28:18.390
while the real killer gets off
scot-free.

28:23.003 --> 28:25.238
Tell him that next time
you talk to him.

28:45.025 --> 28:47.126
(sighs)

28:47.161 --> 28:49.061
So, Dad...

28:50.330 --> 28:52.331
...how's business going?

28:54.434 --> 28:56.402
We don't have
to have polite conversation.

28:56.436 --> 28:59.205
ETHAN:
Fine.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.140
All right, well,
how about any conversation?

29:02.409 --> 29:04.343
You ever hear from Mom?

29:04.378 --> 29:06.112
No.

29:06.146 --> 29:08.147
She has a life.

29:08.182 --> 29:09.315
She left.

29:09.349 --> 29:12.151
Right, because of me.

29:12.186 --> 29:15.021
You and I both know
why she left,

29:15.055 --> 29:16.956
and if she were here right now,

29:16.990 --> 29:19.125
she'd be as disappointed
in you as I am.

29:21.028 --> 29:22.414
Okay, excuse me,
Mr. Whitehorse...

29:22.415 --> 29:22.929
No, Sutton!

29:22.963 --> 29:24.964
- Just forget it.
- No! I...

29:24.998 --> 29:26.399
I don't get it.

29:28.402 --> 29:31.037
Don't you have to care
about someone

29:31.071 --> 29:33.339
in order to be disappointed
in them?

29:33.373 --> 29:36.209
Care about him?

29:36.243 --> 29:39.011
All I ever wanted
was to care about him.

29:39.046 --> 29:41.940
Well, then, what is
holding you back?

29:41.941 --> 29:43.082
He's your son.

29:44.218 --> 29:47.053
Yeah, they told me.

29:47.087 --> 29:48.988
The cops.

29:49.022 --> 29:51.224
You're wanted for murder.

29:54.394 --> 29:58.097
Dad... I didn't do that.

29:58.131 --> 30:00.199
(sighs)

30:00.234 --> 30:02.235
All right?
I didn't murder the guy.

30:03.370 --> 30:05.371
Yeah.

30:05.405 --> 30:07.240
Right.

30:14.147 --> 30:16.148
Ethan, you have to go out there
and tell him what happened.

30:16.183 --> 30:19.018
Look, that might work
in the world you come from,

30:19.052 --> 30:21.053
but not mine.

30:21.088 --> 30:23.155
- Ethan, wait!
- No, no, no.

30:23.190 --> 30:25.291
Look, you've turned
your whole life upside down

30:25.325 --> 30:27.393
trying to find
your birth mother.

30:27.427 --> 30:29.395
Okay, you're expecting
this happy ending.

30:29.429 --> 30:31.264
Well, you take it
from me, Sutton,

30:31.298 --> 30:35.001

He doesn't think Ethan did it.

between you and Sutton?

33:21.237 --> 33:24.239
What did she tell you?

33:24.273 --> 33:27.409
She thought she said or did
something to piss Ryan off

something about that,

33:36.319 --> 33:37.385
but I misunderstood.

33:37.420 --> 33:39.354
All right.
I'll-I'll see ya.

33:50.199 --> 33:53.502
Did something happen between you and
Sutton at the Black and White Ball?

33:59.442 --> 34:01.409
Sutton came onto me.

34:01.444 --> 34:05.113
I didn't want to tell you
because she's your best friend.

away from her.

34:50.159 --> 34:52.193
We took a vote, and it's time.

For your initiation.

34:58.367 --> 35:00.068
No, not if you like pancakes.

35:00.102 --> 35:03.104
First-time band members,
it's your first gig...

35:03.139 --> 35:04.306
you gotta do IHOP.

35:06.142 --> 35:07.542
It's good, you just gotta
sample every pancake

35:07.577 --> 35:09.544
from every foreign
destination offered.

35:09.579 --> 35:12.113
Could I take a rain check?

35:12.148 --> 35:13.481
There is no rain check
for your first night.

35:13.516 --> 35:15.350
This cannot be re-created,
you know, the magic

35:15.384 --> 35:18.119

the pancakes.

35:18.154 --> 35:19.120
You don't want to miss this.

35:19.155 --> 35:20.355
(laughs)

35:20.389 --> 35:22.557
I'll see if I can
rearrange my plans.

35:22.592 --> 35:24.426
Okay.

35:27.330 --> 35:28.430
- Those mariachis...
- Yeah, huh?

That's the big guy

35:36.606 --> 35:38.306
(imitates plinking the strings)
(laughs)

35:38.341 --> 35:39.541
I don't know.

35:39.575 --> 35:41.209
What a great night, huh?

35:41.243 --> 35:43.244
Yeah.

35:46.282 --> 35:49.150
I should probably go.

35:50.252 --> 35:52.387
Why don't you stay?

35:55.358 --> 35:56.358
The kids?

35:56.392 --> 35:58.360
Yeah.

35:58.394 --> 36:00.428
I was a little surprised
about what you told them.

36:00.463 --> 36:01.529
What?

36:01.564 --> 36:03.064
I mean, part of me
thought you were making

36:03.099 --> 36:04.466
a bigger deal
out of what we have.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.434
What do we have?

36:06.469 --> 36:08.269
Don't turn it around on me.

36:08.304 --> 36:10.138
I'm asking you.

36:10.172 --> 36:11.306
I just don't want
to label things, that's all.

36:11.340 --> 36:13.108
I don't want to...

36:13.142 --> 36:14.542
And I don't want to cause
any problems for anyone.

36:14.577 --> 36:15.543
Please. No problems.

36:15.578 --> 36:17.379
You're not...
You're not.

36:17.413 --> 36:19.147
Hmm.

36:21.150 --> 36:23.551
I-I just think it's pretty
simple, you know.

36:23.586 --> 36:27.555
I knew you
in high school.

36:27.590 --> 36:29.557
Turns out I really
didn't know you at all.

36:29.592 --> 36:32.260
Now here we are.

36:32.294 --> 36:33.528
It's a new us,

36:33.562 --> 36:37.365
a chance to get to know
each other now.

36:37.400 --> 36:41.302
I know one way
we could do that.

36:54.705 --> 36:55.772
Nice try.

36:55.806 --> 36:58.742
Sweet note, but you
could've woke me up.

36:58.776 --> 36:59.776
I didn't have the heart to.

36:59.810 --> 37:00.944
You looked so peaceful
sleeping there.

37:00.978 --> 37:02.712
(sweetly):
Oh...

37:02.747 --> 37:04.681
To be honest, the goal
is to try to get home

37:04.715 --> 37:05.815
before the kids wake up.

37:05.850 --> 37:07.150
You know, avoid that
"walk of shame" thing, so...

37:07.917 --> 37:08.565
Shame?

37:08.566 --> 37:11.720
It's just a turn of phrase,
that's all.

37:11.755 --> 37:13.789
So we're okay?

37:13.823 --> 37:15.758
I think we're
better than okay, yeah.

37:15.792 --> 37:17.593
Okay.

37:17.627 --> 37:19.628
So, now you know
why I'm back.

37:19.662 --> 37:21.797
Do I?

37:21.831 --> 37:26.502
Well, you had to wonder why I
showed up after all these years.

37:26.536 --> 37:27.903
It's crossed my mind, yeah.

37:27.937 --> 37:30.472
I didn't come back
to get away from my ex-husband

37:30.507 --> 37:32.474
or for a fresh start,

37:32.509 --> 37:34.510
not in the traditional
sense, anyway.

37:34.544 --> 37:36.912
I-I came back for you.

37:39.649 --> 37:41.950
Well, you got me.

37:48.908 --> 37:49.875
(knocking on door)

37:49.909 --> 37:52.077
(sighs)

37:52.111 --> 37:54.913
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:54.947 --> 37:57.716
Come in.

37:57.750 --> 37:59.718
It's kinda crazy over
at my house right now,

37:59.752 --> 38:01.767
but with all the Sutton stuff,

38:01.768 --> 38:04.923
I think I'm flying way
under the radar, so...

38:04.957 --> 38:06.992
I could probably stay
for awhile.

38:07.026 --> 38:09.961
Cool.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.964
Are you mad that I went
out with the band?

38:14.100 --> 38:17.669
No.

38:17.704 --> 38:18.136
Then we're good?

38:19.772 --> 38:21.740
Yeah.

38:21.774 --> 38:24.976
(whispers): Then why does
it still feel weird?

38:25.011 --> 38:28.046
I came to hear you last night.

38:28.081 --> 38:29.948
You did?

38:29.982 --> 38:31.717
I didn't see you.

38:33.119 --> 38:36.121
That's 'cause you
didn't have a chance.

38:36.155 --> 38:39.991
Your dad basically escorted me
out after your first song.

38:42.095 --> 38:46.131
He told me that you had
moved on, and so should I.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.935
I just want
to come clean, Laurel.

38:49.969 --> 38:53.972
Have a fresh start...
not pile lies on top of lies.

38:56.676 --> 38:59.945
My parents have
some very strong opinions

38:59.979 --> 39:01.980
about their daughters'
boyfriends right now.

39:03.116 --> 39:06.651
This is working.

39:06.686 --> 39:09.054
I see you less, not more.

39:10.690 --> 39:12.858
Let's not waste any more time

39:12.892 --> 39:15.794
debating the future
when we have right now.

39:28.941 --> 39:31.009
So are you still
seeing Rebecca?

39:32.645 --> 39:35.046
Yeah.

39:35.081 --> 39:37.682
And you're still
doing this,

39:37.717 --> 39:39.918
all just to sort of
keep an eye on her?

39:39.952 --> 39:41.920
Mm-hmm.

39:43.055 --> 39:45.090
Have you slept with her?

39:45.124 --> 39:46.725
Whoa...

39:46.759 --> 39:49.628
Ted, I'm a single guy.

39:49.662 --> 39:50.695
She's a single woman.

39:50.730 --> 39:51.730
Yeah.

39:51.764 --> 39:55.033
You know, you should
smile about this.

39:55.067 --> 39:56.968
Think of it this way:

39:57.003 --> 39:58.804
Closer I get to her,

39:58.838 --> 40:02.741
the safer your secret is.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.009
Hmm?

40:04.043 --> 40:05.710
Come on.

40:14.620 --> 40:15.887
(knocking on door)

40:15.922 --> 40:18.657
Come in.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.062
Glad you came back.

40:24.096 --> 40:27.899
Starting to think what I would
do if I got stuck here.

40:27.934 --> 40:30.702
I needed some time to think.

40:30.736 --> 40:34.706
I'm sorry,
I was out of line.

40:34.740 --> 40:38.877
No, I had no right
to attack your dream

40:38.911 --> 40:40.679
of finding your birth mother.

40:40.713 --> 40:44.716
You and Emma deserve to know
where you come from.

40:44.750 --> 40:49.821
It's just hard for me
to understand why.

40:49.856 --> 40:53.825
I mean, you've got
two parents that love you.

40:53.860 --> 40:57.796
And you have a family
that cares about you.

41:00.032 --> 41:05.003
I have a father who wants
nothing to do with me...

41:05.037 --> 41:09.040
and a mother that I'm probably
never going to see again.

41:09.075 --> 41:12.611
So...

41:14.881 --> 41:20.752
You can't blame
yourself for that.

41:20.786 --> 41:25.790
She left for her own reasons,
who knows what they are.

41:25.825 --> 41:29.895
Your mother didn't leave
because of you,

41:29.929 --> 41:32.898
any more than...

41:32.932 --> 41:36.735
than my mother left
because of me.

41:58.958 --> 42:03.795
Mads, please, we've have
to talk about this.

42:03.829 --> 42:05.864
What's left to talk about?

42:05.898 --> 42:09.634
After all these weeks of blowing
me off and keeping secrets,

42:09.669 --> 42:12.771
suddenly you were nice to me
again, and I fell for it.

42:12.805 --> 42:14.806
You said you'd be my
alibi for the concert,

42:14.840 --> 42:18.777
and then you call my house,
all innocent, and tell my Dad

42:18.811 --> 42:22.614
that I never even
showed up at the library.

42:22.648 --> 42:24.716
No, I didn't.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.785
You've gotta go.

42:26.819 --> 42:27.852
No, Mads, please, you got.

42:27.887 --> 42:29.888
And Ryan told me
that you came onto him

42:29.922 --> 42:30.956
at the Black and White Ball.

42:30.990 --> 42:32.657
So what was that about?

42:32.692 --> 42:33.925
All this time
you were just acting

42:33.960 --> 42:36.628
like you hated him so you could
have him for yourself?

42:36.662 --> 42:38.964
You just can't handle that
a guy might pick me over you.

42:38.998 --> 42:39.998
It wasn't me.

42:40.032 --> 42:41.633
I wouldn't do that to you.

42:41.667 --> 42:43.935
Well, if it wasn't you,
who was it?

42:44.937 --> 42:46.905
It was Sutton!

42:46.939 --> 42:49.708
Sutton might have done those
things to you, but I didn't!

42:49.742 --> 42:51.643
What are you talking about?

42:51.677 --> 42:53.812
You are Sutton.

42:53.846 --> 42:57.549
I... I'm...

42:57.583 --> 42:59.551
I'm not Sutton Mercer.

42:59.585 --> 43:02.721
I am Emma Becker,
her twin sister.
