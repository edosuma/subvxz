WEBVTT

00:04.636 --> 00:08.305
- Son of a...
- The word you're looking for is Earp.

00:08.307 --> 00:11.274
Did Bobo have anything
to do with the attack

00:11.276 --> 00:13.310
- on the Homestead?
- Why can't I remember anything?

00:13.312 --> 00:15.612
- Was it Lou that took away my memories?
- Or was it Bobo?

00:15.614 --> 00:18.748
- Who abducted Willa?
- And how does he know me?

00:18.750 --> 00:20.217
I don't even know you!

00:20.942 --> 00:22.252
Willa Earp!

00:25.056 --> 00:26.555
Willa Earp?

00:27.593 --> 00:29.492
I'll be goddamned.

00:29.494 --> 00:32.229
Ah, ah! Well, it all makes sense now.

00:32.231 --> 00:35.232
- What does?
- Uh-uh.

00:39.471 --> 00:43.406
- Goddamn! The surge.
- The what?

00:44.776 --> 00:45.709
OK.

00:47.246 --> 00:49.446
Couple years before
Wynonna came to town...

00:50.983 --> 00:52.282
...we all felt it.

00:52.284 --> 00:57.320
It was this... powerful rippling
throughout the Ghost River Triangle.

00:57.623 --> 00:59.789
We didn't think anything of it.

01:00.492 --> 01:03.727
- The Heir was dead.
- But I'm not, am I?

01:06.331 --> 01:08.665
Aw, you two got a beef, huh?

01:09.334 --> 01:13.903
Bitch on bitch makes for very
bankable entertainment.

01:14.439 --> 01:16.806
Look, Bourbon Bob,

01:16.808 --> 01:20.477
or whatever the hell your name
is, you think this is a game...

01:21.013 --> 01:23.580
...it's one I came back
to finish. But this time,

01:23.582 --> 01:25.282
I make the rules.

01:25.584 --> 01:27.784
And no one will stop me.

01:27.786 --> 01:29.786
Not Bobo, not Black Badge,

01:29.788 --> 01:33.657
and certainly not a useless son
of a goddamned bitch like you.

01:38.764 --> 01:39.829
Willa, no...

01:51.810 --> 01:53.710
He wasn't giving us anything.

01:54.813 --> 01:56.446
He wasn't ours to kill.

01:56.648 --> 01:59.516
- Dolls...
- ...has nothing to do with this curse

01:59.518 --> 02:01.451
and certainly has a serious
attitude problem.

02:01.753 --> 02:03.586
I don't like him, Wynonna.

02:04.209 --> 02:05.241
Well, who does?

02:06.010 --> 02:08.858
I need to find out why Bobo
showed up at the Homestead.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.594
- I had a clear shot at him and you...
- I panicked.

02:12.764 --> 02:14.464
Bobo knows things about me.

02:14.666 --> 02:16.399
I saw it in his eyes.

02:17.469 --> 02:20.437
He dies, all those answers go away. OK?

02:20.639 --> 02:22.539
- No.
- Wynonna,

02:22.541 --> 02:25.675
- what is happening to us?
- What's happening

02:25.677 --> 02:28.478
is that we're down a gun.
Because as far as heirs go...

02:30.449 --> 02:31.681
...it looks like there are two.

02:54.232 --> 02:55.197
What do you see?

03:02.106 --> 03:05.074
- Willa, Willa, my forehead.
- Don't tell me what to do.

03:07.245 --> 03:10.313
- Sorry.
- OK, I'm calling it.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.315
Hypnotizing a cult victim?

03:12.317 --> 03:14.317
- It could fry her brain.
- It's OK.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.428
- I can do this.
- OK.

03:16.636 --> 03:17.359
We're good.

03:18.701 --> 03:21.535
Breathe in, and breathe out.

03:22.638 --> 03:25.339
Let yourself go into the void,
nothing in particular.

03:26.075 --> 03:26.940
Just being.

03:27.876 --> 03:31.511
What do you see?

03:31.747 --> 03:34.781
They've got me.

03:35.884 --> 03:38.652
Daddy, help me!

03:39.601 --> 03:41.068
Daddy!

03:42.791 --> 03:43.757
Wynonna!

03:47.663 --> 03:48.595
He has his hand

03:48.597 --> 03:50.464
- over my mouth.
- Shh.

03:51.433 --> 03:52.766
He's saying not to scream.

03:54.370 --> 03:55.736
If you scream,

03:55.738 --> 03:58.839
I'm going back for your sisters
to skin them alive.

03:58.841 --> 04:00.407
Shh.

04:10.753 --> 04:11.618
Malcolm.

04:12.588 --> 04:14.521
I'm glad I killed him first.

04:15.624 --> 04:16.857
We need to try again.

04:16.971 --> 04:17.904
No.

04:22.130 --> 04:24.030
I'll get Nicole to drive her home.

04:29.605 --> 04:31.972
How many times do I have to tell
you? That stuff is poison.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.709
I've been dressing her wound
for the past two days.

04:35.711 --> 04:37.911
Yeah. And I've been re-dressing it.

04:39.882 --> 04:42.516
Coconut oil. We used it

04:42.518 --> 04:44.017
on everything at the commune.

04:44.686 --> 04:46.420
You know, you don't have
to be here every time.

04:46.422 --> 04:47.654
I know what I'm doing.

04:47.656 --> 04:50.424
- Oh yeah...
- Uh, hey!

04:50.759 --> 04:52.726
Why don't you pop out,

04:52.728 --> 04:55.762
- and I'll talk to you later?
- Sure. I'll just...

04:56.632 --> 04:57.564
... "pop out."

05:03.839 --> 05:04.938
I was rude again, wasn't I?

05:04.940 --> 05:07.707
No. It's fine.

05:08.911 --> 05:11.445
On top of everything
else, I have to learn

05:11.447 --> 05:12.979
how to be around regular people again.

05:15.684 --> 05:18.852
Until then... you've got me.

05:23.759 --> 05:24.658
Hm.

05:25.961 --> 05:27.928
OK, can we talk about

05:27.930 --> 05:30.030
the weaponed-up elephant in the
room, and narrow down

05:30.032 --> 05:32.999
- who tried to assassinate you?
- Oh, that could be a long list:

05:33.769 --> 05:36.570
Bobo, Lucado...

05:36.572 --> 05:38.572
You think your boss
tried to snuff you out?

05:38.574 --> 05:41.608
We have a pretty contentious relationship.
And I gotta explore

05:41.610 --> 05:43.710
- all options.
- Doc.

05:45.581 --> 05:47.481
- Come on, you joking?
- No.

05:47.683 --> 05:49.683
He... He's an option. He fled town.

05:49.685 --> 05:50.984
He didn't "flee." You gave him a car.

05:50.986 --> 05:52.953
There may be a lot of people
that want me dead,

05:52.955 --> 05:54.621
but it ain't Doc Holliday.

05:55.624 --> 05:58.525
And if it was him, he'd just
deliver the dynamite himself.

05:59.962 --> 06:01.862
Yeah, he is classy like that.

06:01.864 --> 06:04.498
Look, if you want me
to put an APB out on him...

06:04.500 --> 06:06.800
No. I'm not asking for anything.
I really don't give a shit where he went.

06:06.802 --> 06:08.702
OK. Yeah.

06:09.805 --> 06:11.705
Jesus, look at this stuff.

06:11.707 --> 06:14.241
It's like Black Friday sale
at dudeswhokill.com.

06:14.243 --> 06:18.078
And, uh, yeah. I found this when
I disposed of the bodies.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.514
Those are elements
indicative of Rangers.

06:20.716 --> 06:22.549
- Those are your peeps.
- Yeah.

06:23.585 --> 06:25.552
- Guess nothing's sacred, huh?
- Apparently not.

06:25.554 --> 06:28.054
- But the elements right here...
- The Machetes.

06:29.825 --> 06:32.826
Another elite group.
Dangerous guys. Guns, drugs,

06:32.828 --> 06:36.096
delicious potato salad that'll go
from lips to hips in five seconds.

06:36.098 --> 06:37.664
You know what?

06:38.066 --> 06:39.766
They have a chapter here in town.

06:39.768 --> 06:41.568
Bet it started with ex-servicemen.

06:46.275 --> 06:47.641
We make a pretty good team.

06:47.643 --> 06:49.609
- We should get t-shirts.
- Don't push it.

06:49.978 --> 06:51.678
You got a sec?

06:52.047 --> 06:54.147
Yeah! Anything for Purgatory's finest.

06:54.750 --> 06:57.083
Other than me of course.

07:03.325 --> 07:04.925
- When did you...?
- This morning.

07:04.927 --> 07:06.126
What is it?

07:06.128 --> 07:08.862
- I'll deal with it. Thanks.
- Right.

07:12.701 --> 07:14.701
- That guy needs to unclench.
- Come on, Earp.

07:17.005 --> 07:18.572
There's no rest for the wicked.

07:21.910 --> 07:24.344
Bobo, not to be awkward,
but the boys are worried

07:24.346 --> 07:26.780
that we won't be crossing over. Again.

07:27.349 --> 07:29.683
The dissenters will be punished.

07:29.685 --> 07:30.850
Everything is in place.

07:33.722 --> 07:35.989
I said everything.

07:40.028 --> 07:41.595
Now go press my pant suit.

07:42.998 --> 07:44.030
Go.

07:46.902 --> 07:48.969
Everything is in place,
right, Cryderman?

07:48.971 --> 07:52.706
Yes. An ice sculpture, champagne...

07:52.708 --> 07:54.608
Rivers of champagne.

07:55.677 --> 07:56.743
And the Wainwright?

07:56.745 --> 07:59.846
See, why would you want that old hotel,

07:59.848 --> 08:02.115
- when I can get you...

08:02.117 --> 08:05.018
We got it. I was only asking, Bobo.

08:05.621 --> 08:07.153
That is a Bobo no-no.

08:08.757 --> 08:11.224
It's all exactly
like you wanted, I swear.

08:12.394 --> 08:13.693
Huzzah.

08:13.695 --> 08:15.629
He lives to see another day.

08:16.098 --> 08:19.799
Please. Make it stop.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.250
Bravo. Bravo!

08:39.388 --> 08:41.988
Bubs, you never disappoint.

08:49.064 --> 08:50.196
Now, you see, right there.

08:50.198 --> 08:54.067
Dial it back five percent,
and our plan will be perfection.

09:10.886 --> 09:12.285
It's a happy day. Ah, ah!

09:15.156 --> 09:17.823
Deputy Marshal Dolls.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.692
Oh yeah? And what's your story, honey?

09:21.929 --> 09:23.729
Well, for starters,

09:23.731 --> 09:25.998
my coat may be cute but it's
way too thin for this weather,

09:26.000 --> 09:27.900
and then I totally forgot
to exfoliate this morning

09:27.902 --> 09:29.802
and now I have to take the biggest whiz.

09:29.804 --> 09:31.937
Mind if we step inside for just a sec?

09:31.939 --> 09:33.906
Much as I'd like to see you
with your panties off...

09:34.675 --> 09:36.608
...you all can go screw
yourselves a good day.

09:40.815 --> 09:44.216
Oh God! You know littering
is bad for the heart, right?

09:44.218 --> 09:45.784
- How's that?
- Because when you litter...

09:45.986 --> 09:47.586
Oof!

09:48.656 --> 09:52.491
- I hit you in the heart.
- Storytime's over, bitch.

09:53.694 --> 09:57.062
- Come on, Earp.
- Yes sir, Mr. Deputy Marshal.

10:03.537 --> 10:04.837
I'm exhausted.

10:05.940 --> 10:06.905
Hey...

10:15.516 --> 10:16.648
I know, baby.

10:50.985 --> 10:51.750
Shit.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.987
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

10:56.257 --> 10:58.624
Wow. Wynonna never said anything

10:58.626 --> 11:00.659
about you being a...

11:02.263 --> 11:03.629
...a gay.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.800
Oh geez. You haven't told her.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.068
I have to go.

11:14.675 --> 11:15.874
Call me later.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.306
Wynonna'd probably be pretty
pissed if she found out

11:24.308 --> 11:27.209
you didn't tell her something
like this, wouldn't she?

11:28.179 --> 11:29.077
There it is.

11:32.810 --> 11:33.775
You remember that beam?

11:35.352 --> 11:37.052
When I was four,

11:37.054 --> 11:39.254
you caught me going
through Daddy's drawer

11:39.256 --> 11:42.157
and you promised not to tell, if...

11:43.660 --> 11:44.892
...I walked across that beam.

11:45.716 --> 11:46.649
I didn't...

11:48.933 --> 11:50.199
- Daddy was...
- What?

11:51.101 --> 11:52.134
Attentive?

11:53.163 --> 11:55.430
Huh? Aware of your birthday?

11:59.389 --> 12:01.255
Willa, I could have broken my neck.

12:09.253 --> 12:11.353
I figured you all for human.

12:11.355 --> 12:14.356
- The Machetes don't discriminate.
- Me either!

12:31.041 --> 12:32.441
Welcome aboard the Earp Express.

12:33.611 --> 12:35.010
Enjoy your trip to Hell.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.283
- That ain't working right.
- It's fine.

12:45.289 --> 12:48.323
Alright. Start talking,
or I take your head for a spin.

12:48.325 --> 12:49.925
Alright, alright!

12:49.927 --> 12:52.060
So who hired you sacks
of shit to kill me, huh?

12:52.062 --> 12:54.396
The judge, man. Sometimes
he hires us to pull jobs.

12:54.434 --> 12:57.199
Cryderman. Where the hell is he?

12:57.301 --> 12:59.368
- And why does he want me dead?
- I don't know.

12:59.370 --> 13:01.303
We just picked up a bag
of money from Shorty's,

13:01.305 --> 13:03.787
didn't ask for nothing
but a picture for the hit.

13:05.103 --> 13:06.408
Well, I'm gonna need that bag.

13:11.048 --> 13:13.248
Shit. If I'd known your life
was worth this much...

13:13.250 --> 13:14.449
We're giving it to charity.

13:17.988 --> 13:20.155
Of course. Puppies and orphans.

13:20.157 --> 13:21.123
Perfect.

13:24.962 --> 13:26.381
Dolls, something happened back there...

13:26.406 --> 13:27.219
You did well.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.064
OK?

13:31.035 --> 13:33.468
Man... You know, when I first met you...

13:34.939 --> 13:36.204
Girl, you were a mess.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.372
- Hey!
- What?

13:37.374 --> 13:39.474
"Hot." I prefer "hot" mess.

13:44.214 --> 13:47.015
Now I wouldn't want to fight
with anyone else by my side.

13:52.423 --> 13:53.724
I'm hungry, you hungry?

13:53.749 --> 13:55.147
Look, I have to show
you something, alright?

13:59.163 --> 14:02.064
Nedley found the car on the
edge of the Ghost River Triangle.

14:03.434 --> 14:05.400
It was pointed back towards Purgatory.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.237
They said there was no body, so...

14:14.211 --> 14:17.312
Earp, if anyone can get out
of a burning car,

14:17.314 --> 14:18.380
it'd be Doc Holliday.

14:19.383 --> 14:21.283
He'd only just learned to drive.

14:43.474 --> 14:44.306
Ah!

14:46.410 --> 14:49.011
- You can't come here.
- I'm not going to hurt you.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.546
You already have.
I can see it in your eyes.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.183
One day, I'll remember how...

14:56.353 --> 14:57.285
...and I'll come for you.

15:02.559 --> 15:06.795
Back the hell up or I'll shoot
you for real, Bobo Del Rey.

15:06.797 --> 15:08.363
- You can't kill me.
- No.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.499
But I can bring the pain.

15:24.048 --> 15:27.115
- Hey!
- I'm so sorry I made you walk on beams.

15:27.117 --> 15:29.317
No, no. I'm sorry I called you a bitch.

15:30.821 --> 15:31.653
In my head.

15:34.291 --> 15:35.090
What's that?

15:36.593 --> 15:38.293
I have no idea what it means.

15:42.533 --> 15:43.565
I think I do.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.141
Oh!

15:53.143 --> 15:55.677
Oh!

15:59.675 --> 16:02.943
I'm a lucky man, happening
on you like I done.

16:02.945 --> 16:05.846
Yeah. Your knife skills

16:05.848 --> 16:07.748
are legendary.

16:08.117 --> 16:10.684
I've been a fan for years.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.754
Oh, it is so nice to meet an admirer.

16:14.951 --> 16:16.717
And I must say, you are
the spitting image

16:16.719 --> 16:17.718
of your brother, Vinnie.

16:19.254 --> 16:21.154
You ratted him out to Wynonna.

16:21.156 --> 16:23.356
Oh, bygones, my friend.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.325
- Bubba, isn't it?
- Big Bubba.

16:26.561 --> 16:27.627
Of course.

16:27.629 --> 16:30.530
And I suspect from your fine
chemistry skills,

16:30.532 --> 16:32.432
Mr. Bubba,

16:32.434 --> 16:35.719
that you are here
on assignment. For whom?

16:37.172 --> 16:38.471
I want a lesson.

16:40.108 --> 16:41.374
I want answers.

16:41.702 --> 16:42.935
And my hat.

16:44.145 --> 16:46.112
Since we're opening up to one another.

16:47.082 --> 16:48.247
Bobo Del Rey.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.450
That's who hired me.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.520
Any specifics on this "job?"

16:54.823 --> 16:57.256
One question, one answer,

16:57.258 --> 17:00.626
one lesson. And I'm keeping the hat.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.262
- Of course.
- Yah.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.531
Yah... Well, this time...

17:05.532 --> 17:06.566
Yah. Hem...

17:07.367 --> 17:10.236
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:12.173 --> 17:15.141
...plant your feet as
though rooted to the very ground.

17:15.609 --> 17:16.608
Now I beg of you,

17:16.611 --> 17:18.544
and I do mean beg,

17:18.546 --> 17:21.314
shoot from the elbow, not the shoulder.

17:21.316 --> 17:24.117
- I cannot emphasize this enough.
- The elbow!

17:28.388 --> 17:30.223
Very good, Mr. Bubba.

17:30.625 --> 17:33.526
- A faster learner there never was.
- Yah.

17:33.528 --> 17:36.196
Another drink, if you don't mind.

17:47.675 --> 17:50.309
Ahh! Much obliged.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.331
Now, how long do you
intend to keep me here?

17:53.356 --> 17:55.915
- Yah. Until they're gone.
- Who?

17:55.917 --> 17:57.416
Everyone.

18:03.761 --> 18:07.062
Hey, hey, hey. Look, you don't
have to do this, OK, right now.

18:07.064 --> 18:09.064
- Are you screwing with me?
- Oh, God.

18:09.066 --> 18:12.067
Someone got to Doc and they're trying
to kill you, then they're winning.

18:12.470 --> 18:14.169
And I will not let them win.

18:14.171 --> 18:16.205
Look, we don't have to go in
guns blazing. We have time.

18:16.207 --> 18:18.907
Huh. Tell that to Cryderman.

18:19.043 --> 18:21.076
What? Cryderman?

18:21.078 --> 18:22.745
I think he's about to kill himself.

18:27.151 --> 18:30.085
Hey! Quick! No!

18:31.222 --> 18:32.855
I wanna die.

18:32.857 --> 18:35.923
Oh, I want that for you too, Judge.

18:35.925 --> 18:38.111
-But you gotta give answers first,
crybaby.

18:40.791 --> 18:43.625
You hired a bunch of ex-military
bikers to assassinate me.

18:44.034 --> 18:46.535
- Why?
- He forced my hand.

18:46.536 --> 18:48.269
- Who?
- Bobo.

18:49.367 --> 18:50.500
It's always been Bobo.

18:50.502 --> 18:53.236
He cuts and I bleed.

18:53.237 --> 18:56.371
Money, dignity, my very soul.

18:56.374 --> 18:58.374
He's reduced me to nothing.

18:58.376 --> 18:59.475
Aww.

18:59.477 --> 19:02.311
The way you reduced so many
young delinquents, huh?

19:02.647 --> 19:04.347
Wow! Full circle.

19:05.350 --> 19:06.549
Pure poetry.

19:06.551 --> 19:08.451
You two could walk away
from this prison.

19:09.254 --> 19:11.287
- I'm a lifer.
- You gotta start talking.

19:13.258 --> 19:15.725
Bobo's throwing a party tonight
at the old Wainwright.

19:16.227 --> 19:18.694
I figured him for more retro
roller rink, less heritage hotel.

19:19.898 --> 19:20.930
He insisted.

19:20.932 --> 19:23.232
Anything about a clue? A lead?

19:23.234 --> 19:25.268
He's obsessed with that thing.

19:25.270 --> 19:27.170
-It's a thing?

19:28.506 --> 19:29.405
So what is it?

19:30.240 --> 19:31.273
Does he have it?

19:31.275 --> 19:33.275
- No idea.

19:34.311 --> 19:38.713
Right. So, the Wainwright houses
a bunch of antiques, right?

19:39.517 --> 19:41.417
- Maybe the lead could be there.
- We get in there,

19:41.419 --> 19:43.786
get it first, there goes
his ticket out of the Triangle.

19:45.490 --> 19:48.191
Alright. You're gonna
get us into that party.

19:48.193 --> 19:49.625
Do you not check your mail?

19:49.727 --> 19:52.328
The whole town is invited.
Black tie, no guns.

19:52.697 --> 19:54.397
- The whole town.
- Yeah, everybody.

19:54.399 --> 19:56.499
- All of the town.
- Even... yeah.

19:58.269 --> 20:00.670
Great. Then you're coming with
us, and you're going to help.

20:00.672 --> 20:01.704
No, no, no. I can't.

20:01.706 --> 20:03.506
Bobo will know I betrayed him.

20:03.508 --> 20:05.208
We'll protect you, don't worry.

20:05.210 --> 20:07.243
You can barely protect
yourselves. Who are we kidding?

20:08.979 --> 20:11.446
Yeah, well, shit happens.

20:13.317 --> 20:15.417
Shit happens. Ha!

20:16.654 --> 20:17.620
I like that.

20:29.734 --> 20:32.735
The ground here tremors
more than open fields.

20:32.737 --> 20:34.770
But not enough for the Big City.

20:35.607 --> 20:38.541
- Purgatory, are we?
- 'Spose we are.

20:38.543 --> 20:41.611
No doubt the powder there will play

20:41.613 --> 20:43.613
a significant part in one of Bobo's

20:43.614 --> 20:45.347
more nefarious plans.

20:45.350 --> 20:49.685
The most significant part.
It's complicated.

20:50.588 --> 20:52.455
You know,

20:52.457 --> 20:55.391
there was a time when
I fashioned my own gunpowder...

20:56.526 --> 20:58.252
...and though the ratio of a perfect

20:58.277 --> 21:01.463
75:15:10 was imperative,

21:01.466 --> 21:04.467
I found the secret
was in crafting my own.

21:04.468 --> 21:06.334
You made your own saltpeter?

21:07.271 --> 21:08.536
Well, if you saw

21:08.538 --> 21:11.406
- what this could do...
- Son,

21:11.409 --> 21:13.643
I'm frickin' Doc Holliday.

21:13.644 --> 21:15.744
Nothing impresses me anymore.

21:15.746 --> 21:17.746
Well, frickin'

21:17.748 --> 21:20.315
Doc Holliday... Ha!

21:21.419 --> 21:23.686
There's a pleasant fragrance. Peaches?

21:23.688 --> 21:25.688
Yeah. Peaches.

21:28.726 --> 21:29.692
Hello!

21:33.464 --> 21:35.698
Yah. Yah, yah, yah, yah.

21:39.537 --> 21:41.370
- No!
- Shh, shh.

21:41.372 --> 21:44.307
That's enough, there, little rabbit.

21:51.082 --> 21:53.549
Oh... oh...

22:00.591 --> 22:03.726
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

22:06.497 --> 22:08.397
Oh yah, yah, yah, yah!

22:09.100 --> 22:10.666
Oh...

22:15.340 --> 22:16.472
Wonderful.

22:19.811 --> 22:21.811
No cabins, no boats,

22:21.813 --> 22:22.712
no people.

22:24.382 --> 22:26.115
For a place with such a beautiful name,

22:26.117 --> 22:27.883
Swan Reservoir sure is creepy.

22:28.586 --> 22:30.820
- You recognize anything?
- No.

22:31.789 --> 22:33.756
- Do you think this is where...
- Yeah.

22:34.492 --> 22:36.625
It's a protected bird sanctuary

22:36.627 --> 22:39.128
in the ever revenant-friendly
Ghost River Triangle.

22:39.130 --> 22:40.529
The perfect place to...

22:41.826 --> 22:43.926
- ...cage a...
- To cage a young bird.

22:49.741 --> 22:50.639
Willa?

22:52.710 --> 22:53.509
This is it.

22:57.715 --> 22:58.681
Some cage.

23:17.835 --> 23:19.402
The view's quite pretty.

23:20.138 --> 23:21.437
Seriously?

23:23.408 --> 23:27.910
I'm sorry. This is so many different
kinds of horrible. I was learning

23:27.912 --> 23:29.478
how to ride a bike,

23:29.480 --> 23:31.947
and playing woodland
princess after school,

23:31.949 --> 23:32.982
and you...

23:35.787 --> 23:37.420
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

23:57.642 --> 23:58.607
A woman.

23:59.944 --> 24:01.444
With a pink car.

24:03.548 --> 24:04.480
A witch.

24:05.650 --> 24:06.882
Constance Clootie.

24:09.187 --> 24:11.687
Do you even know
the definition of "free?"

24:12.790 --> 24:14.990
You. Can. Go.

24:19.797 --> 24:22.865
- What did you do to my head?
- Gave it a little cleanse.

24:22.934 --> 24:25.468
All those pesky memories, gone.

24:26.537 --> 24:28.637
You're better off without them,
dear. Now come on.

24:28.639 --> 24:29.605
Chop chop.

24:35.813 --> 24:37.546
She may have rescued me...

24:38.340 --> 24:40.049
...but I had no idea
what price I would pay.

24:41.273 --> 24:42.273
Your memories.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.527
They're coming back now.

25:04.742 --> 25:05.774
They are.

25:07.612 --> 25:09.267
Oh my god, they are.

25:12.917 --> 25:14.683
There's so much to do.

25:25.830 --> 25:26.962
Dolls?

25:28.599 --> 25:30.666
Why in the world would you
need my dress size?

25:32.003 --> 25:32.935
Hey.

25:32.937 --> 25:36.572
This is what you'll be wearing
to the Winter Solstice.

25:36.574 --> 25:39.808
- OK, cool. What does it do?
- It covers your body.

25:39.810 --> 25:41.911
Yeah, but is it bulletproof?

25:41.913 --> 25:45.614
- Does it have cameras in it? Sensors?
- Yes, to none of those things.

25:46.584 --> 25:48.167
I can bring my own damn dress.

25:48.192 --> 25:50.119
You wearing your midriff-baring baby tee

25:50.121 --> 25:52.321
and your "good jeans" isn't
really black tie.

25:52.323 --> 25:54.957
We gotta blend in with the people
of Purgatory, not scare them.

25:54.959 --> 25:57.693
- Ha! Bobo will do that.
- Yeah.

25:58.563 --> 25:59.628
Look at this.

25:59.630 --> 26:01.697
Nothing but dark corners
and lots of rooms.

26:01.699 --> 26:04.567
Whatever he's planning,
whatever he's looking for,

26:04.569 --> 26:06.702
it's a total mystery.

26:09.674 --> 26:11.073
What part of "stay on the Homestead"

26:11.075 --> 26:13.642
- didn't you understand?
- We found it.

26:14.579 --> 26:15.711
The Swan Reservoir.

26:15.713 --> 26:17.580
The place I was kept all those years.

26:17.619 --> 26:18.568
It was Bobo.

26:19.919 --> 26:21.392
And these were scattered everywhere.

26:22.458 --> 26:24.858
- But then I was rescued.
- Yeah,

26:24.860 --> 26:27.795
- by Constance Clootie.
- But she erased my memories.

26:27.797 --> 26:29.460
Constance Clootie never does

26:29.486 --> 26:31.490
anything unless it benefits
Constance Clootie.

26:32.501 --> 26:33.467
There's more.

26:36.838 --> 26:37.737
We have a deal?

26:38.808 --> 26:41.108
Where have all the honorable men gone?

26:42.478 --> 26:43.644
Dead, I suppose.

26:43.646 --> 26:46.880
Your great-granddaddy Wyatt would
never have aligned with a revenant.

26:46.882 --> 26:49.583
- I'm not Wyatt.
- No shit.

26:50.186 --> 26:51.819
But what's done is done.

26:51.821 --> 26:54.588
- So are we in agreement?
- We have ourselves a deal.

26:57.193 --> 26:58.792
Then the Lead is yours.

27:02.465 --> 27:04.565
Bobo already has the lead.

27:04.567 --> 27:06.834
Not according to Constance.
What, did he lose it?

27:06.836 --> 27:08.735
Well, clearly he's found it again.

27:09.772 --> 27:11.605
OK, none of this
is clear to me.

27:11.607 --> 27:13.540
We think the lead is at the hotel.

27:13.642 --> 27:15.576
It's a trap. You realize that, right?

27:15.578 --> 27:17.678
Look, he doesn't know
that we know about the Lead.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.913
- Maybe we can get there before him.
- We'll be outnumbered.

27:20.167 --> 27:21.734
Nothing outnumbers three Earps.

27:22.251 --> 27:24.551
I've bumped up against worse problems.

27:24.553 --> 27:26.063
Yeah, but why bring Champ into this?

27:26.222 --> 27:27.721
We need all hands on deck.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.600
Fine. But we make a plan,

27:33.668 --> 27:35.301
and we stick with it. Deal?

27:35.531 --> 27:37.598
- Deal.
- Yeah, deal.

27:39.702 --> 27:41.034
That's not what you're wearing,
though, is it?

27:41.036 --> 27:41.802
No.

27:43.973 --> 27:45.072
Not wearing that either.

27:48.244 --> 27:50.844
You're right! It's all in the elbow.

27:50.846 --> 27:53.780
You are a master in the making.

27:53.782 --> 27:54.648
Ha!

27:54.936 --> 27:57.236
This is what we've been
waiting for, is it?

27:57.897 --> 28:00.732
Awesome. One more day, bro,

28:00.734 --> 28:03.868
and we're free.
Bringing your new friend?

28:04.204 --> 28:06.971
- Makes one helluva trophy.
- You talk too much.

28:06.973 --> 28:08.106
Ha, ha, ha! I hear that.

28:08.814 --> 28:12.243
It's going to be some party,
though. Shit is going down.

28:13.747 --> 28:14.946
Wish we were there to see it.

28:14.948 --> 28:17.014
Now you deliver that straight to Bobo.

28:17.753 --> 28:21.886
There's a little bit extra.
You can keep some for yourself.

28:22.522 --> 28:25.223
- It's real good fun, bro.
- The whole thing?

28:25.225 --> 28:26.524
- Yah.
- Just up the...

28:26.526 --> 28:27.258
Yah, just up.

28:28.828 --> 28:29.761
Thanks, man.

28:38.505 --> 28:40.238
Here's hoping he chews

28:40.240 --> 28:41.973
his own tongue off.

28:43.276 --> 28:44.175
Ah!

28:49.182 --> 28:50.148
I lied.

28:50.150 --> 28:52.183
It's all in the wrist.

29:00.927 --> 29:04.061
Now, what was this about a party?

29:37.507 --> 29:38.706
We have an agreement?

29:42.045 --> 29:43.278
How could I say no?

29:43.280 --> 29:46.381
But let's not let
curiosity kill this cat.

29:46.783 --> 29:47.882
Tell me why, Ward.

29:49.452 --> 29:50.385
For my family.

29:50.387 --> 29:54.289
I walk across with you and my
girls are free from this curse.

29:55.492 --> 29:57.458
Daddy said we're supposed
to hide the letter.

29:57.460 --> 29:59.694
I did. Willa, I swear.

30:32.495 --> 30:33.461
The Lead.

30:40.537 --> 30:43.371
- You are a vision.
- Oh please,

30:43.373 --> 30:44.706
I didn't even have time to accessorize.

30:44.708 --> 30:47.508
See, I knew I wore this bracelet

30:47.510 --> 30:50.545
- for a reason.
- Thanks.

30:51.081 --> 30:54.615
Hey, if we get out of here, we are
getting dressed up way more often.

30:54.617 --> 30:56.818
What do you mean,
"if we get out of here?"

30:58.421 --> 30:59.387
Um...

30:59.389 --> 31:00.822
Just stay by the exits, OK?

31:02.792 --> 31:05.626
- Willa.
- Hey, come.

31:17.574 --> 31:19.841
- I saw all that, you know.
- Not now, Champ.

31:20.443 --> 31:23.911
So you two are, like, together
now, eh? That's disgusting.

31:23.913 --> 31:25.380
Disgusting.

31:29.348 --> 31:30.651
OK, so I've counted

31:30.653 --> 31:32.620
thirteen vents in this room alone.

31:32.756 --> 31:36.591
And how would Bobo use those to
further his nefarious plan?

31:36.593 --> 31:39.827
- AC us to death?
- I'm being serious.

31:39.829 --> 31:42.930
So am I. Just, it all seems so harmless.

31:42.932 --> 31:45.633
How could a party with
so much bubbly be bad?

31:45.635 --> 31:46.701
- Champagne?
- Thank you.

31:46.703 --> 31:49.904
- Can't we celebrate a little?
- Celebrate what?

31:49.906 --> 31:53.641
Being out. I'm sure you haven't
been out in a while,

31:53.643 --> 31:55.977
and I haven't been out... ever.

31:57.614 --> 31:59.680
Oh, God. I keep forgetting.

31:59.682 --> 32:02.650
Am I, like, the most
insensitive sister ever?

32:02.652 --> 32:03.885
It's a tie.

32:05.508 --> 32:06.674
I'm kidding!

32:07.891 --> 32:09.557
It is kinda fun, though, right?

32:11.961 --> 32:14.495
Anything can turn bad
if revenants come around.

32:15.565 --> 32:17.832
I don't feel safe
without Peacemaker here.

32:18.668 --> 32:21.569
- Wynonna's still coming, right?
- Yeah, of course.

32:25.575 --> 32:27.575
- Dammit!
- You in there somewhere?

32:27.577 --> 32:29.577
- Freezing.
- OK.

32:29.579 --> 32:31.045
Of all the days not to wear a bra.

32:31.781 --> 32:34.515
- I feel like a walking umlaut.
- All for the cause.

32:35.752 --> 32:36.984
- Security?
- No.

32:37.854 --> 32:39.720
- Metal detectors?
- Nada.

32:40.223 --> 32:42.557
Well, why did I just
climb through the window?

32:43.120 --> 32:45.321
- What the hell is Bobo playing at?
- Is that...?

32:45.695 --> 32:48.696
Yeah. One bullet with Bobo's name on it.

32:48.698 --> 32:50.765
- Should he choose to show.
- Oh, he'll show.

32:50.967 --> 32:53.701
I can feel it. We'll be ready.

32:54.003 --> 32:56.737
You'll be ready. You're in
the crosshairs of a revenant.

32:57.187 --> 32:58.341
The worst revenant.

32:58.521 --> 33:00.808
Bobo comes looking for you? Bang.

33:00.810 --> 33:03.578
- Right between the eyes.
- Wynonna...

33:03.580 --> 33:04.745
Trust me.

33:12.989 --> 33:14.489
"Dear Robert"...

33:17.727 --> 33:19.961
Oh, holy... holy shit. Hem!

33:20.263 --> 33:21.662
- Wow.
- Yep.

33:23.666 --> 33:26.534
So whose stick I gotta yank to get
a hanger and a coat check tag?

33:41.050 --> 33:42.550
Can I just say...

33:44.367 --> 33:45.333
Damn.

33:46.823 --> 33:48.263
Told you I could get my own dress.

33:48.265 --> 33:50.091
Yeah, you sure did. Jeez.

33:50.727 --> 33:51.692
I also got this.

33:54.931 --> 33:57.598
- "Dear Robert"?
- Yeah, fancy, right?

33:57.767 --> 34:01.536
Yeah. You know, at one time,
people used to...

34:02.005 --> 34:04.839
...start conversations with
something other than, "Yo, dummy."

34:05.975 --> 34:07.008
But who's Robert Svane?

34:08.610 --> 34:10.545
He was a close confidante of Wyatt's.

34:11.681 --> 34:12.847
The letter's our...

34:12.849 --> 34:14.949
great-great-granddaddy's. Dated years

34:14.951 --> 34:17.885
- after he was cursed.
- And he confides everything.

34:17.887 --> 34:20.554
How he was cursed when
he killed the demon Clootie,

34:20.556 --> 34:23.123
how the Ghost River Triangle
holds all revenants...

34:23.126 --> 34:25.126
They have to cross over
with the Earp heir

34:25.128 --> 34:28.795
and the heir has to go willingly
on the Winter Solstice.

34:28.797 --> 34:30.965
So that gives us less
than twenty-four hours.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.067
So the attack on the homestead...?

34:33.069 --> 34:35.902
- Was all a ruse.
- It went wrong so quickly.

34:36.039 --> 34:37.772
Because Bobo reneged.

34:38.041 --> 34:39.674
They were never supposed to take you.

34:39.676 --> 34:40.975
Willa was just insurance.

34:40.976 --> 34:44.779
But they underestimated Ward. They
went after his daughter, then Wynonna

34:44.781 --> 34:47.748
grabbed Peacemaker,
and all bets were off.

34:47.750 --> 34:50.818
So Bobo's gonna try again.
Cross the Ghost River Triangle

34:50.820 --> 34:52.587
with the heir. But, guys,
what's the Lead?

34:53.337 --> 34:55.947
That's just it. The heir is the Lead.

34:57.727 --> 34:58.960
Willa was right.

34:59.045 --> 35:01.262
He had the Lead and then he lost it...

35:01.331 --> 35:04.098
...lost her, to Constance.

35:04.607 --> 35:07.034
Bobo saved Willa's life.
He's been obsessed with her

35:07.036 --> 35:08.970
since she arrived
in Purgatory. Guys, I'm...

35:11.007 --> 35:12.673
I'm not the true Earp heir.

35:14.944 --> 35:15.977
Willa is.

35:18.306 --> 35:20.873
- We have to get you out of here.
- Oh, screw that.

35:22.018 --> 35:23.084
I'm not going anywhere.

35:28.146 --> 35:30.226
- Can we get Willa out the back?
- I told you.

35:30.229 --> 35:33.230
I'm done running away from that maniac.

35:33.232 --> 35:34.683
She's right. Running
probably won't help.

35:34.685 --> 35:37.768
- Bobo could have taken her at any time.
- So why the party then?

35:37.768 --> 35:39.901
I don't know I've done
ten laps of this place

35:39.903 --> 35:42.437
- and I still have no clue.
- But we have Peacemaker.

35:43.874 --> 35:45.106
Remember,

35:45.109 --> 35:47.042
the letter says you'd have
to go willingly.

35:47.044 --> 35:48.911
OK, so we just sit here and wait?

35:48.913 --> 35:49.879
Of course not.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.081
We drink.

35:55.646 --> 35:56.979
That's not the worst idea, right?

35:58.749 --> 35:59.714
Come on.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.828
You know, as soon as we break up,

36:05.830 --> 36:07.830
you just swoop in and steal my girl.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.866
OK, lower your voice. Waverly
doesn't belong to anyone.

36:11.704 --> 36:13.804
Oh, yeah, blah blah blah feminism blah.

36:13.806 --> 36:16.106
Champ! You're drunk. And
apparently a raging homophobe.

36:16.108 --> 36:17.974
Oh, you think this is
because she's a girl?

36:17.976 --> 36:20.077
OK, Champ, I think you've had enough.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.813
Of course you're gonna take her side.

36:21.815 --> 36:25.216
You know, every time I failed that
preliminary law enforcement exam,

36:25.217 --> 36:29.219
she would say, "It's OK, Champ.
You have nothing to prove."

36:29.221 --> 36:32.723
But apparently that was a lie.
She's dating a cop.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.795
Well, I guess that would be
their own private business.

36:39.765 --> 36:41.131
Come on, son, let's get you out of here.

36:41.133 --> 36:42.132
No!

36:42.134 --> 36:44.768
Oh, my God!

36:44.770 --> 36:47.137
Champ, are you on something
other than bubbly?

36:47.473 --> 36:49.306
Ho! Ho, ho, ho!

37:03.989 --> 37:05.756
But sip. Be cool.

37:06.091 --> 37:08.058
Says the guy who eats
salad for breakfast.

37:09.963 --> 37:11.162
Ugh. I hate champagne.

37:11.164 --> 37:13.097
The good news is, we know Bobo's plan.

37:13.098 --> 37:15.232
- If he's got it right.
- He does.

37:15.688 --> 37:16.587
Willa's the heir.

37:18.871 --> 37:21.338
Just because she shot Peacemaker
just like you...

37:21.340 --> 37:23.273
Ha, ha! Not like me at all.

37:26.044 --> 37:27.811
Back at the bikers',

37:27.813 --> 37:29.212
there was this revenant.

37:31.904 --> 37:33.737
Dolls, I tried
to shoot him at five feet.

37:34.820 --> 37:38.054
Peacemaker just... flickered and jammed.

37:38.524 --> 37:39.990
Whatever our connection was...

37:41.994 --> 37:43.326
...that gun's clearly made its choice.

37:44.196 --> 37:46.029
Hey look, doesn't matter, OK?

37:46.031 --> 37:49.800
Except I go back to being
plain ole human. No offense.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.837
I just...

37:56.041 --> 37:58.942
I never wanted this,
but after a while...

38:01.547 --> 38:04.347
I just felt... I just felt like it fit.

38:06.018 --> 38:07.217
Like I was meant to be.

38:09.188 --> 38:10.887
But I'm not... I'm not special.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.189
- I'm just some girl.
- Hey.

38:12.191 --> 38:15.258
You were never 'just' anything.

38:16.195 --> 38:18.228
Guess I can go back to
bumming around Europe, huh?

38:20.658 --> 38:23.365
If you think you're going somewhere,
you're in for a whole lot of hurt.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.101
Forget the gun.

38:26.905 --> 38:27.871
You're one helluva deputy.

38:30.242 --> 38:31.374
And Black Badge needs you.

38:34.013 --> 38:35.079
Ahem!

38:37.616 --> 38:38.315
Screw 'em.

38:40.619 --> 38:41.885
I need you.

38:54.939 --> 38:56.338
Doc?

39:05.244 --> 39:08.144
Peaches.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.413
Wynonna, did you drink any of this?

39:10.415 --> 39:11.648
- What?
- Did you?

39:11.650 --> 39:12.983
No, why? What's going on?

39:12.985 --> 39:14.451
I'm too late. Goddamn it.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.953
We got to stop all these people
from drinking the champagne now.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.021
Good evening.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.992
Is everyone having a good time?

39:23.061 --> 39:25.362
Well, I hope so, because
I'm only gonna say this once.

39:25.364 --> 39:27.197
Maybe twice. I haven't decided yet.

39:27.199 --> 39:30.133
I have some good news

39:30.135 --> 39:31.434
and I have some bad news.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.038
The good news...

39:37.242 --> 39:38.909
...is there's an antidote.

39:42.648 --> 39:44.147
To what, you ask?

39:48.520 --> 39:50.453
Hi.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.122
Well, you see...

39:54.360 --> 39:56.160
...that's the bad news.

39:56.162 --> 39:59.063
All this delicious bubbly
that you've been drinking...

39:59.665 --> 40:02.432
...like drunken pigs has been poisoned.

40:04.437 --> 40:07.471
You will all slowly go batshit crazy.

40:08.308 --> 40:11.175
Exhibit A, Champ Hardy.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.079
How you doin', Champ?

40:17.316 --> 40:18.481
Not good!

40:22.054 --> 40:24.521
One lucky contestant
will receive the antidote.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.057
All they have to do is bring me

40:27.059 --> 40:30.527
one person, dead or alive,

40:30.529 --> 40:32.362
and that one person is...

40:33.332 --> 40:34.531
Ms. Wynonna Earp.

40:37.369 --> 40:38.468
Have fun.

40:47.514 --> 40:48.479
Wynonna.

40:51.854 --> 40:53.332
Get Willa out of here.

40:53.333 --> 40:54.620
- Go.
- OK. Got it.

40:54.889 --> 40:55.788
Quick.

40:59.093 --> 41:00.760
Uh, Nicole, come with us.

41:00.762 --> 41:02.628
Champ's right, Waves.
You're dating a cop now.

41:02.630 --> 41:04.564
- We go where the danger is.
- God, that's sexy.

41:04.719 --> 41:07.420
Look, Nedley's calling backup.
We're gonna contain this, OK?

41:07.602 --> 41:08.216
OK.

41:08.241 --> 41:09.674
You didn't drink the champagne, did you?

41:09.677 --> 41:11.137
- No. You?
- No.

41:11.760 --> 41:12.759
OK.

41:14.689 --> 41:15.855
OK, go.

41:17.045 --> 41:20.713
Shit. Willa? WILLA!

41:33.094 --> 41:34.193
Hey, baby.

41:35.264 --> 41:36.663
Do you remember me now?

41:38.226 --> 41:39.392
Yes, Robert.

41:40.688 --> 41:41.687
I do.
