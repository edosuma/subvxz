WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:04.421
- The time?
- 4:30.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.256
- Fill me up.
- That's your sixth cup.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.758
- Yes, it is.
- How about some tea?

00:07.841 --> 00:10.552
Absolutely. Throw it in with the coffee.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.347
- I assume Rory's meeting you here?
- Yes, she is.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.642
She's late. I have to go to class tonight,
so I have 10 more minutes.

00:16.725 --> 00:17.976
- I got it.
- You did?

00:18.060 --> 00:20.395
- Right here.
- Hurry up, open it.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.191
- Leave the pot, Ethel.
- I'm just an enabler.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.778
Just remember, these are the PSATs.
It's like the Baby Gap.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.448
They don't count as much. You can
take them again. Plus, you are young.

00:31.532 --> 00:35.244
You have years of learning ahead.
The important thing is that you tried hard.

00:35.327 --> 00:38.038
I got a 740 Verbal and a 760 Math.

00:38.580 --> 00:42.417
- Thank God you're not an idiot.
- I got a 740 Verbal and a 760 Math?

00:42.501 --> 00:45.879
Those are damn good scores,
little lady, really. Amazing. Top-notch.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.841
Those are PSA-Terrific.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.884
Sorry, I had to go for it. You're frowning.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.470
- How did I get a higher score in Math?
- Who cares?

00:53.554 --> 00:57.099
- I'm stronger in Verbal. Verbal is my thing.
- No, VerbaI's my thing.

00:57.182 --> 01:00.102
Maybe I didn't study hard enough.
Maybe I got cocky.

01:00.185 --> 01:03.647
Maybe you need
a mud bath-salt glow-chill pill combo.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.733
- I'm just saying...
- You got a great score.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.403
- Yeah, but...
- No. A great score.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.487
Great score?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.865
That is a score you have earned
and you deserve...

01:12.906 --> 01:16.285
and will allow you to look down at me
for many years to come.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.204
We should celebrate.
Let's get all dressed up tonight...

01:19.246 --> 01:21.415
- and hit The Rocky Horror Picture Show?
- Serious?

01:21.498 --> 01:23.250
- I'm always serious.
- Can I invite Lane?

01:23.333 --> 01:24.459
Absolutely.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.588
I hope she gets this in time.
She's been hard to reach lately.

01:27.671 --> 01:31.258
Maybe she can't handle the pressure
of having such a brilliant best friend.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.219
- Brilliant in Math. The VerbaI's kind of sad.
- Thank you.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.847
- You're late.
- Shoot. I am. I have to go.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.974
Rory kicked some major PSAT ass today.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.185
- Yeah? Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.979
We're gonna hit
The Rocky Horror Picture Show tonight.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.898
- Really?
- Yes, I am Magenta.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.900
Rory opts for Janet. I had a thought.

01:47.983 --> 01:50.319
- Yeah?
- I was thinking that you could put on...

01:50.402 --> 01:53.280
fishnet stockings, a leather teddy,
platform boots, and come...

01:53.363 --> 01:55.574
- as Dr. Frank-N-Furter.
- That is a thought.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.619
- You'll also need some gloves and a wig.
- Gloves, wigs. Got it.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.204
- I'll do your makeup.
- That'll help.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.914
- There you go.
- Sounds great.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.791
- 8:00, I'll swing around and get you?
- Sure, good.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.669
If by some chance you knock on the door
but no one answers...

02:07.753 --> 02:10.422
even if the lights are on,
I'll meet you there.

02:10.506 --> 02:14.218
- So I'll see you tomorrow morning?
- I'll be the one with the coffee.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.681
Make sure you gloat a little.
It's good for the skin.

04:02.201 --> 04:03.493
Rory!

04:03.577 --> 04:06.663
Do you think the porch is falling apart,
or do you weigh a ton?

04:06.747 --> 04:09.875
The porch is fine.
It has a little extra ventilation in it now.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.711
- The wood is old and rotting.
- It is not old and rotting.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.464
It is strong and sprightly and will be
with us for a long time to come.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.925
So you do weigh a ton?

04:18.007 --> 04:20.469
- I checked under the entire house.
- And?

04:20.552 --> 04:22.304
- You have termites.
- What?

04:22.387 --> 04:25.849
Tens of thousands of them.
Subterranean, drywood, the whole gamut.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.976
- Gross.
- Four crawled up my nose.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.395
It happens all the time
when you're upside down.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.732
To them, the nostril looks like
another hollow passage in the wood.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.860
- They're not too bright.
- Okay, so we have termites.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.446
What do we...
Don't you want to come inside, Kirk?

04:39.530 --> 04:42.282
Actually, I would prefer
to discuss this outside.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.204
Let's get down to it.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.457
From what I witnessed,
your house is a bug-infested smorgasbord.

04:50.541 --> 04:51.625
Are those for me?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.919
- Yeah.
- What do we do?

04:55.003 --> 04:58.048
- I'd prefer to discuss this on the lawn.
- Why?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.759
This porch could give out on us
at any minute.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.928
Kirk, that's crazy.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.973
- Stop. The porch is fine.
- Your foot went through it today.

05:06.056 --> 05:09.184
- That was different. That wood was old.
- What happened to sprightly?

05:09.268 --> 05:10.978
Kirk, what are you doing?

05:11.270 --> 05:15.399
Making sure that if the roof comes down,
the debris can't ricochet and take me out.

05:15.482 --> 05:19.403
In five more minutes, you won't need to.
Please talk to me about the termites.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.905
- What do I do, tent the place?
- To start with, yes.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.198
- To start with?
- What?

05:23.282 --> 05:26.827
They've done some serious damage.
They've eaten through the wooden joists.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.538
Your foundation has lost
its structural integrity.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.081
Our house is falling down.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.168
- What should I do to fix this?
- You have to jack the house up...

05:34.251 --> 05:37.421
rebuild the joists, and repair
the weakened parts of the foundation.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.799
- All for the low price of...
- I haven't done the exact estimate.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.635
I'd say somewhere in the neighborhood
of $15,000.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.431
- Tell it to move to another neighborhood.
- Sorry?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.725
- $15,000?
- We're never eating again.

05:49.808 --> 05:53.061
I don't have $15,000.
I've never had $15,000.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.314
I'm trying to picture $15,000, I can't.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.983
That's how unfamiliar
$15,000 and I are with each other.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.485
You can just fix part of the house,
the part you like.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.405
- We like the entire house.
- Really? Even that kitchen?

06:03.488 --> 06:04.781
Thanks for coming over.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.950
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know yet.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.161
You don't want to wait too long
to address this.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.370
I get that.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.748
- You might get the dishes out of there.
- Good tip.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.375
- Thanks for the waffles.
- Thanks for the horrifying news.

06:15.459 --> 06:16.793
Any time.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.507
Look at it this way.
The day's all uphill from here.

06:21.548 --> 06:25.052
- This is really bad.
- Don't worry. We'll figure something out.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.930
- We should get inside.
- Yeah.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.265
After you.

06:36.230 --> 06:39.983
- Eleven, twelve, here.
- Thanks.

06:40.859 --> 06:44.905
- One, two three...
- I'm depressed.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.200
- Jeremy didn't call?
- Not in a timely manner, no.

06:48.242 --> 06:51.203
- Good riddance to bad luggage.
- I guess.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.873
I thought we really connected
the other day in the supply closet.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.376
Boys. A Nancy Drew mystery.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.546
- Louise. Madeline.
- You look happy.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.172
Really?

07:03.257 --> 07:05.217
- What?
- Nothing.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.554
It's just a nice day. A nice, nice day.

07:08.595 --> 07:12.391
- Okay.
- Did you get your PSAT scores back yet?

07:12.474 --> 07:14.601
- Yeah. Yesterday.
- And?

07:14.685 --> 07:17.229
- 500 Verbal, 560 Math.
- Respectable.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.356
- I thought so.
- Louise, what did you get?

07:19.439 --> 07:22.568
- Highlights, around my face.
- You'll take them again and do better.

07:22.651 --> 07:27.072
- I'll do that and get my nose done.
- You don't study. You don't apply yourself.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.616
- I need another chip.
- Take them.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.202
- So I got my scores back today, too.
- Yeah?

07:32.286 --> 07:36.832
This morning. I came downstairs,
and there they were, sitting on the table.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.879
Boy, was I nervous,
just imagining what I got.

07:42.921 --> 07:46.884
Then I realized that I'd have to
open them eventually, and so I did.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.595
Was I surprised by what I found.

07:50.888 --> 07:53.348
Could've knocked me over with a feather.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.768
Yep. I was just that surprised.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.105
So, what did you get?

08:00.355 --> 08:04.318
Rory, since you asked, and by the way,
I'm not bragging or anything...

08:04.401 --> 08:07.321
but I got a 750 Math and a 730 Verbal.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.531
- That is good.
- Congratulations.

08:09.615 --> 08:11.742
- Thank you.
- Those are great scores.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.953
- Did you get your scores back yet?
- Yep.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.414
- And?
- I'm happy.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.124
- How happy?
- Pretty happy.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.418
How do I know you're not
one of those people...

08:21.502 --> 08:23.462
who gets pretty happy
looking at a sunset?

08:23.504 --> 08:26.006
How do I know what your barometer
for pretty happy is?

08:26.089 --> 08:27.799
- You don't.
- Right.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.136
- So, are you?
- Am I what?

08:32.179 --> 08:34.890
Are you one of those who gets happy
looking at a sunset?

08:34.972 --> 08:38.059
- I don't get unhappy looking at a sunset.
- What did you get?

08:38.143 --> 08:40.187
- That's personal.
- Why won't you tell me?

08:40.270 --> 08:42.397
'Cause it's none of your business.

08:42.688 --> 08:46.985
- Okay, fine. Don't tell me what you got.
- I won't.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.613
Why won't you tell me your score?

08:49.863 --> 08:50.948
Bye, Paris.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.242
You're not torturing me, you know.
I don't care!

08:53.325 --> 08:56.411
My scores were great.
I'm very happy with my scores.

08:56.495 --> 09:00.791
And I hate looking at a sunset,
so my standard for happiness is high!

09:11.969 --> 09:13.971
- Rory, wake up.
- What's going on?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.889
- I can hear them chewing.
- Who?

09:15.973 --> 09:19.643
The termites. They're everywhere,
nibbling and eating and swallowing.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.728
- You're insane.
- I can't sleep here.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.772
- What?
- We have to go to Sookie's.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.440
You're kidding, right?

09:26.817 --> 09:28.110
It's 11:00 p. m.

09:28.193 --> 09:31.238
Well, here. But somewhere
in the world, it's still Miller time.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.491
Mom, you're wigging.
Go put on some imaginary earplugs...

09:34.575 --> 09:37.661
to drown out the imaginary
termite sounds and go back to sleep.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.454
- But...
- Bed. Now.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.458
- You really don't hear them?
- No.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.211
And as soon as you're asleep,
you won't, either.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.882
- Okay, fine. Good night.
- Good night.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.810
- I feel like they're crawling all over me.
- I know.

10:01.894 --> 10:04.104
With their creepy little fangy teeth...

10:04.188 --> 10:06.440
their tail things and their pointy tentacles.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.358
You have no idea
what a termite looks like.

10:08.442 --> 10:11.695
Unless they're wearing a foundation
repair guy T-shirt, I don't care.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.906
- You sure Sookie was up?
- She answered the phone.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.575
- After how many rings?
- I don't know, 20 or 30.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.703
- Mom, she was sleeping.
- No. She's just deaf in one ear.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.413
- Since when?
- Now, apparently.

10:21.497 --> 10:22.498
What?

10:22.581 --> 10:27.377
You would have to be deaf in one ear
not to hear the phone ring 20 or 30 times.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.423
There they are,
my little termite whisperers.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.967
- Sookie, sorry to call so late.
- And so incessantly.

10:34.051 --> 10:37.012
They were getting organized.
I heard one of them yell, 'Charge!'

10:37.095 --> 10:39.515
- We will make this up to you.
- What are you saying?

10:39.598 --> 10:42.267
- This is great. It's like a slumber party.
- You sure?

10:42.309 --> 10:47.272
Absolutely. We can raid the fridge, we can
make a nice avocado-mango facemask.

10:47.606 --> 10:50.817
Get out the tarot cards, tell fortunes,
play Twister...

10:50.901 --> 10:54.071
make a Haagen-Dazs chocolate
chocolate chip ice cream milkshake.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.907
- We'll watch Purple Rain.
- Sookie, it's midnight.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.993
- Let's go straight for the milkshakes.
- Good thinking.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.246
I'll put my stuff in the guest room.

11:02.287 --> 11:05.707
Sookie, I really appreciate you letting us
crash here tonight.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.293
So creepy, just lying there...

11:08.377 --> 11:12.422
listening to a thousand tiny little insects
just mocking me.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.050
'Ha, ha! We're eating your house.
Try and stop us. '

11:15.133 --> 11:17.261
- When are you going to tent?
- Next week.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.345
That sucks.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.139
- $2,000.
- That sucks.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.268
And after the $2,000 circus-tent fiasco...

11:24.351 --> 11:28.063
I have to find another $15,000
to keep my house from falling down.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.899
- I like that house.
- I know you do.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.151
- I don't want it to fall down.
- I know you don't.

11:33.235 --> 11:36.655
- Anyway, I called the bank today.
- How did that go?

11:36.738 --> 11:39.283
Well, wait, what's that?

11:39.324 --> 11:41.159
- They're still laughing.
- What?

11:41.243 --> 11:44.329
They passed the phone around,
made me ask everyone in the place.

11:44.413 --> 11:47.666
That is terrible. Completely heartless.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.544
According to the jolly bankers,
I'm worth nothing.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.838
There so has to be something you can do.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.841
I was thinking about opening
a Coyote Ugly lemonade stand.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.093
- Interesting.
- What's interesting?

11:58.177 --> 12:02.723
Nothing. Your mom is apparently
one of the biggest losers in Stars Hollow.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.517
- Okay. Continue.
- You should call them again tomorrow.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.145
- No, Sookie.
- No, I mean it.

12:08.187 --> 12:11.398
You're an upstanding citizen,
an active part of the community.

12:11.481 --> 12:15.110
You made all of the donkey outfits
for the Christmas festival last year.

12:15.194 --> 12:17.654
You organized the 'Save the Historic
Oak Tree' campaign.

12:17.738 --> 12:21.533
You played Tevye in the Stars Hollow
Community theater production...

12:21.617 --> 12:23.285
- of Fiddler on the Roof.
- Yes.

12:23.368 --> 12:27.039
Five and a half stars from the
Stars Hollow Gazette. Unheard of till then.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.541
- They should take that into account.
- Yes, they should.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.668
Yes, they should, but they won't.

12:35.172 --> 12:39.176
I bet there's a room at the inn
you could stay in, part-time at least.

12:39.218 --> 12:40.886
- What was that?
- What?

12:40.969 --> 12:43.055
- That noise.
- What noise?

12:43.138 --> 12:45.933
A huge thud just came from your closet.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.352
Yeah, that's my shoes.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.063
- Your shoes?
- Yeah. That's my shoe closet.

12:51.480 --> 12:56.401
Sometimes I don't stack them properly,
and then they fall...

12:56.485 --> 13:00.906
and then there's the thudding sound.
And then... No.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.076
That's probably the sound
that you just heard.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.995
- The ice cream's getting melted.
- Jackson?

13:07.079 --> 13:08.747
- Yes.
- How you doing?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.499
I'm doing fine. You?

13:10.874 --> 13:13.752
- Sookie, Jackson's hiding in the closet.
- Yes, he is.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.380
- Why didn't you say something?
- Because you were upset...

13:16.463 --> 13:20.008
you were bringing Rory, I didn't want her
to feel weird or uncomfortable.

13:20.092 --> 13:22.427
- So you stuck Jackson in the closet?
- She did.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.763
- Jackson, come out.
- I'm in my pajamas.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.391
- So are we.
- Yeah, but mine are humiliating.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.685
- We won't laugh.
- Yes, you will.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.687
- I promise we won't.
- I'm fine.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.773
Will you be fine there all night?
'Cause we're staying all night.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.025
Knowing Sookie,
she'll make a big breakfast.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.611
So tonight will last
until late tomorrow morning.

13:39.695 --> 13:42.447
So the bottom line for you here
is you'll be holed up...

13:42.531 --> 13:44.950
in that closet a very, very long time.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.412
If I come out,
you have to understand one thing.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.373
I have a cousin who owns
a Xerox company that specializes...

13:51.456 --> 13:55.127
in taking pictures and making them
into things: Calendars, coffee mugs...

13:55.210 --> 13:59.381
- collector plates, and pajamas.
- Jackson's wearing picture pajamas?

13:59.464 --> 14:00.924
- Yes, he is.
- Does he do this often?

14:01.008 --> 14:03.093
- Almost every night.
- What are the pictures of?

14:03.177 --> 14:06.889
Him. During high school,
in his wrestling uniform.

14:06.972 --> 14:09.641
- You have to come out here right now.
- No.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.894
- Why?
- Because you sound too eager.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.063
- I'm not. Am I eager?
- Put your paws down.

14:15.147 --> 14:19.651
I'm not eager. I just want you to come out
and be comfortable, that's all.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.528
Well, okay.

14:27.201 --> 14:30.996
Honey, we're making milkshakes.
You want to come in and help?

14:31.038 --> 14:32.122
Okay.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.836
If our house does fall down and we end up
living in a hollowed-out tree...

14:37.920 --> 14:40.672
this moment might make it all worth it.

14:43.759 --> 14:46.845
- Hello, Lane?
- What are you doing here?

14:47.054 --> 14:49.431
- Mrs. Kim, hi. I was just...
- Out!

14:49.515 --> 14:51.058
- What?
- Out!

14:51.600 --> 14:53.977
- But I wiped off my feet.
- Move.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.606
I was just looking for Lane,
and I thought she was...

14:57.689 --> 15:00.484
- Taylor says you have termites.
- I don't, my house does.

15:00.526 --> 15:03.529
- You are a carrier.
- I don't think you can be a termite carrier.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.615
- You spread it all over town.
- We don't control the termites.

15:06.698 --> 15:09.868
- They move on their own.
- See all the furniture in there? Wood.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.996
All wood. You must go. Go now!

15:16.542 --> 15:18.710
- Can you just tell me if Lane is home?
- No.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.546
- Do you know where she is?
- School.

15:20.629 --> 15:23.549
- Still?
- Yes. She's there, she's studying.

15:24.091 --> 15:27.052
What's that moving by your foot?
I see something moving.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.887
There's nothing. I swear.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.890
Will you tell her I came by?

15:32.641 --> 15:35.310
Then she chased me
halfway down the street with a hose.

15:35.394 --> 15:39.106
- It was like a scene from Silkwood.
- News travels way too fast around here.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.066
Four people asked me
when we were tenting...

15:41.149 --> 15:44.111
two asked if we were moving,
one asked me if we were atheists.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.280
We have to stop talking to people.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.949
We have to stay at home
with the curtains drawn...

15:49.032 --> 15:53.537
collecting old newspapers, muttering,
and eating Cup-a-Soup and Slim Jims.

15:53.579 --> 15:55.205
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Madeline.

15:55.289 --> 15:58.375
- Hi.
- Listen, I have to ask you a little favor.

15:58.917 --> 16:02.880
I'm working on an article for The Franklin.
Totally last minute.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.507
I thought it would be
interesting to compare...

16:05.591 --> 16:09.136
Chilton's overall PSAT scores
to other prep schools in the area.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.181
I'm trying to compile
a list of people's scores...

16:12.264 --> 16:16.059
especially the top students,
and I realized I don't have yours yet.

16:16.143 --> 16:19.438
- You want to know my PSAT scores?
- That would be great.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.565
- Put Paris on the phone.
- Excuse me?

16:21.648 --> 16:24.610
- Let me talk to her.
- Paris isn't here.

16:24.693 --> 16:27.863
I don't know where she is.
She's probably at her house...

16:27.946 --> 16:31.116
or maybe at the library,
or maybe she's buying pencils...

16:31.158 --> 16:34.745
because she goes through them so fast,
she pushes down on them really hard.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.663
- Then they break...
- Madeline.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.040
Hold on.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.293
- What?
- Pathetic.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.003
- Why won't you tell me?
- Bye, Paris.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.589
Tell me those scores. I have to know.
Rory?

16:48.592 --> 16:50.385
- Paris again?
- Yep.

16:51.136 --> 16:54.973
If we put Paris and my mother in a room
together, the world would implode.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.601
I'll keep that in mind
for the next science fair.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.894
Enough.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.647
I've got computer screens
feeling sorry for me.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.190
How many places is that?

17:03.273 --> 17:06.401
It's not the amount of places
that turns you down that matters...

17:06.484 --> 17:08.945
it's the quality of the place
that turns you down.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.823
When you've got Jacko's Loans
not wanting your business...

17:11.906 --> 17:14.451
- it's time to hang out with the Coreys.
- Sorry.

17:14.535 --> 17:16.494
I won't think about it tonight.

17:16.537 --> 17:19.080
I'll think about it tomorrow. At Tara.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.874
- You ready?
- One sec.

17:21.916 --> 17:24.044
Mom, I hate to bring this up...

17:24.127 --> 17:26.463
but there's an obvious solution
to our problem.

17:26.505 --> 17:27.839
- I know.
- You do?

17:27.923 --> 17:32.344
Yes. Frankly, I think if I sold you
into white slavery, I would miss you.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.390
- Please don't go where you're going.
- I think they would say yes.

17:36.473 --> 17:40.018
Of course they'd say yes.
And that yes would be followed by:

17:40.102 --> 17:44.648
'Okay, enough already. My God,
please, stop. I've got nothing left to give. '

17:44.731 --> 17:46.984
- That's not true.
- That is completely true.

17:47.025 --> 17:50.529
- Grandma and Grandpa will help.
- I went to my parents for you for Chilton.

17:50.612 --> 17:53.532
Why? Because that was worth
all the obligation. This is not.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.993
- This is our home.
- I'll find a way to fix it.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.870
- How?
- I don't know yet.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.372
If you don't know,
then maybe there's not another way.

18:00.414 --> 18:03.458
- There's always another way.
- Was there another way with Chilton?

18:03.542 --> 18:05.586
- That was different.
- Why was that different?

18:05.669 --> 18:08.338
Because I said so.
I'm the one doing the groveling...

18:08.422 --> 18:12.009
and that gets you judgment rights,
and I'm judging that this is different.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.761
- The remaining judge begs to differ.
- I know you mean well.

18:14.845 --> 18:17.222
I'm not gonna deal with my parents
on this one. No.

18:17.306 --> 18:19.975
- You're being stubborn.
- Have I shocked you?

18:20.058 --> 18:21.643
Fine, let's go.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.230
- Where's Grandpa tonight?
- He's at work.

18:25.314 --> 18:29.026
Explain to him that quitting means
you don't go back to the job, you quit.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.904
- He did not quit. He resigned.
- Same rules apply.

18:31.987 --> 18:35.741
When you resign, you have to put in
certain time to get things in order.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.494
He has clients to see,
certain accounts to close out.

18:38.577 --> 18:41.997
- Is that hard for him?
- Actually, I think he's rather enjoying it.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.501
- Good.
- Yes, it is good. What are you taking?

18:45.584 --> 18:47.252
- Roofies.
- Aspirin.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.254
- Are you sick?
- I have a headache.

18:49.296 --> 18:52.299
That means you're sick. You think
it's normal to have a headache?

18:52.382 --> 18:54.092
I just have a tension headache.

18:54.176 --> 18:57.429
- What do you have to be tense about?
- I can't begin to think.

18:57.513 --> 18:59.431
- You should lie down.
- I'm fine.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.475
- You work too hard.
- I don't.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.061
If you didn't, you wouldn't have
a tension headache.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.938
It's not a work tension headache.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.774
- So then you are sick.
- Actually, I am. I'm sick.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.901
- I knew it. What's wrong?
- Consumption...

19:10.943 --> 19:14.029
with a touch of the vapors.
I'm going for a leeching tonight.

19:14.112 --> 19:17.199
- She's got a case of exterminatoritis.
- What's that mean?

19:17.282 --> 19:18.992
- Nothing.
- We have termites.

19:19.076 --> 19:21.370
- That's terrible.
- It's not so bad.

19:21.453 --> 19:23.831
- They're eating our whole house.
- They say thank you.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.791
What does that mean?

19:25.958 --> 19:28.627
We found out that we have
all these foundation problems...

19:28.710 --> 19:30.796
and it's gonna be very expensive to fix.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.673
- Mom can't get a loan.
- That is not true.

19:32.756 --> 19:36.218
- You were turned down by five banks.
- I made up Jacko's Loans and stuff.

19:36.301 --> 19:38.762
- Fine, four banks.
- Mom. Wait.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.640
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing you a check.

19:41.682 --> 19:43.851
No, you're not. Hold on here.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.644
- How much do you need?
- Nothing.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.772
- Don't be ridiculous. Tell me how much.
- I can handle this.

19:48.814 --> 19:51.149
- It doesn't sound like you can handle it.
- I can.

19:51.233 --> 19:54.903
If you won't tell me, I'll leave
the amount blank, you can fill it in later.

19:54.987 --> 19:57.322
- Mom, stop.
- You took my pen.

19:57.364 --> 20:00.284
I appreciate the thought,
but I don't need your money.

20:00.325 --> 20:03.620
You'd rather have your house fall down
than let your mother help you?

20:03.662 --> 20:06.290
The house won't fall down.
Let's not make it a big issue.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.293
Let's sit down, have a drink,
and have dinner, okay?

20:10.627 --> 20:12.504
- All right.
- Thank you.

20:14.006 --> 20:17.467
- Are you going to give me back my pen?
- Yeah. After dinner.

20:23.473 --> 20:26.059
Mom, stop it. Talk to me.

20:28.478 --> 20:31.857
It's been two hours
since you've looked in my direction.

20:39.406 --> 20:42.576
- I get it, you're mad.
- I don't want to talk about this right now.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.703
- You were being stubborn.
- Go to bed.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.830
You didn't want to ask for help, so I did.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.875
You remember the conversation we had
before we left home tonight?

20:49.958 --> 20:52.127
- Yes...
- I told you going to my parents...

20:52.211 --> 20:53.670
- was not an option.
- I know.

20:53.712 --> 20:57.758
I told you several times
that asking my parents was not an option.

20:57.841 --> 21:00.677
I made a few quips to lighten
the subject matter...

21:00.719 --> 21:02.721
but I still made my point
pretty damn clear.

21:02.763 --> 21:05.349
Fine. But we have a real problem here.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.226
You think I don't know that?

21:07.309 --> 21:10.229
You think I sit around all day
swapping witticisms...

21:10.312 --> 21:14.233
with Robert Benchley at the Algonquin?
No. I am thinking and worrying...

21:14.316 --> 21:16.568
and using the computer,
and I hate using it.

21:16.610 --> 21:20.197
- Which is exactly why I brought this up.
- You had no right to bring it up!

21:20.280 --> 21:23.742
- Why?
- Because I told you not to, that's why.

21:23.826 --> 21:26.745
- But...
- No. There will be no 'buts' here.

21:26.787 --> 21:29.248
There's'I'm sorry, Mom,'
there's 'I screwed up, Mom. '

21:29.331 --> 21:32.793
There's'I'll never do it again, Mom,'
but there are no 'buts. '

21:32.918 --> 21:34.086
- But...
- Out!

21:34.127 --> 21:36.088
Go to bed. We're done.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.561
Think fast.

21:53.188 --> 21:54.565
Very good.

21:54.606 --> 21:59.069
- You threw a basketball at my head.
- I threw a basketball past your head.

21:59.111 --> 22:01.238
What if I had turned around
when you said that?

22:01.321 --> 22:04.533
Then you might have caught it,
completing the 'think fast' equation.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.827
- I don't catch basketballs.
- Duly noted.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.830
- I don't even like basketballs.
- I'm very sorry.

22:09.913 --> 22:14.293
Out of all the sporting balls in the world,
the basketball is my least favorite.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.128
- They're round and hard.
- Rory.

22:16.170 --> 22:19.464
- And they're orange.
- You do realize how insane you sound?

22:19.506 --> 22:21.592
- Yes.
- Just checking.

22:21.633 --> 22:24.720
- I'm sorry. I'm in a horrible mood.
- Hadn't noticed.

22:24.803 --> 22:27.306
- We've had fights before.
- You and me?

22:27.389 --> 22:31.185
Me and Mom.
But this one is particularly crazy.

22:31.268 --> 22:34.646
We have a situation here,
and she's being so stubborn.

22:35.647 --> 22:36.732
What?

22:37.357 --> 22:39.401
- What 'what'?
- What was with the 'huh'?

22:39.484 --> 22:42.946
- Nothing.
- There was a meaning behind that 'huh. '

22:42.988 --> 22:45.407
That was a loaded 'huh,'
that wasn't a normal 'huh. '

22:45.491 --> 22:48.702
You meant to say something,
and now you're taking it back.

22:48.827 --> 22:51.997
Don't use that 'huh'
if you're not prepared to defend it.

22:52.748 --> 22:54.082
Why aren't you saying anything?

22:54.166 --> 22:57.127
Because words are
a very dangerous thing right now.

22:57.753 --> 23:00.297
You were saying I'm stubborn
just like my mother.

23:00.339 --> 23:04.593
I was saying that in addition to
all of the wonderful, amazing qualities...

23:04.676 --> 23:08.847
that the two of you share,
there's possibly, on occasion...

23:08.931 --> 23:12.059
a similar tendency to dig your heels in.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.853
- I hate it when we fight.
- I know.

23:14.937 --> 23:17.356
- She was so mad.
- You'll make up.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.152
- Want to get a coffee?
- Yeah.

23:22.194 --> 23:23.695
I'll go get my ball.

23:34.706 --> 23:37.084
If it makes you feel better,
a car ran over it.

23:37.167 --> 23:39.294
I need to get coffee. Now.

23:43.215 --> 23:46.218
Hi, Mr. Regalski, it's Lorelai Gilmore.
Again. Yes.

23:46.301 --> 23:48.804
Just like the pink bunny with the drum.

23:48.887 --> 23:53.725
Anyway, I was wondering if you have had
a chance to reconsider my loan.

23:55.811 --> 23:57.604
No, I think it's Energizer.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.898
I know you said no...

24:00.274 --> 24:01.733
but sometimes people say no...

24:01.775 --> 24:04.528
and then they wake up one morning
a couple of days later...

24:04.570 --> 24:06.905
and think, 'I shouldn't have
turned down that mom...

24:06.947 --> 24:10.951
'with the good job and great credentials
and the references up the wazoo. '

24:11.326 --> 24:13.370
I do like the word 'wazoo. '

24:13.912 --> 24:15.831
I understand. Okay.

24:16.748 --> 24:20.586
I'll give you a call in a couple of days then.
Thank you.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.798
Perhaps you are taking
the wrong approach.

24:24.882 --> 24:27.593
- Meaning?
- You tried to convince them of your virtue.

24:27.676 --> 24:30.596
Perhaps it's time
to offer them a lap dance.

24:31.221 --> 24:33.932
- You didn't!
- I was kidding. Sort of.

24:34.850 --> 24:38.520
I have to do something, and I'm not sure
exactly where to draw the line.

24:38.604 --> 24:41.356
In Thailand, women do this trick
with a Ping-Pong ball...

24:41.440 --> 24:44.902
- that is a big crowd pleaser.
- Line drawn. Thank you.

24:46.445 --> 24:48.906
Independence Inn. Michel speaking.

24:49.781 --> 24:52.284
Yes. She is right here.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.578
Your mother.

24:56.038 --> 24:58.790
I called to tell you
I talked to Miles Hahn today.

24:58.832 --> 25:01.210
That sounds very nice. I'm glad.

25:01.293 --> 25:03.629
- Do you have any idea who Miles Hahn is?
- Not a bit.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.881
He's the president
of the First National bank.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.883
We've been doing business with him
for years.

25:07.966 --> 25:10.052
He's become a very dear friend of ours.

25:10.135 --> 25:13.805
- What does that have to do with me?
- I brought up your little dilemma to him.

25:13.889 --> 25:14.890
Oh, boy!

25:14.973 --> 25:17.643
He told me if you were in the mood
to talk to him...

25:17.726 --> 25:21.980
you could feel free to do so,
on Thursday at 3:15.

25:22.064 --> 25:25.984
- You wrangled me a meeting at your bank.
- I asked a friend for advice.

25:26.068 --> 25:30.239
- What else did you ask him for, Mom?
- I simply asked a man to talk to you.

25:30.322 --> 25:33.283
What you talk about,
or what comes of that talk is up to you.

25:33.325 --> 25:36.370
- Thanks, Mom, but I'm fine.
- So you got a loan?

25:36.453 --> 25:38.664
- I got a lead.
- A lead on a loan?

25:38.705 --> 25:39.957
- Yes.
- How nice.

25:39.998 --> 25:43.210
- If you could just get an actual loan.
- I got to get back to work.

25:43.293 --> 25:44.503
Thursday at 3:15.

25:44.545 --> 25:47.881
Tell your friend thank you,
but I'm afraid I won't be able to make it.

25:47.965 --> 25:50.634
He'll be there whether you show up or not.
It's up to you.

25:50.676 --> 25:53.804
All I did was make an appointment,
Lorelai. That's all.

25:53.846 --> 25:55.556
Great. Bye, Mom.

26:04.231 --> 26:07.359
Hi. Mr. Regalski, please.
It's Lorelai Gilmore.

26:08.527 --> 26:10.904
I just spoke to him five minutes ago.

26:12.447 --> 26:15.242
When do you expect him back
from France?

26:17.619 --> 26:19.872
- I'll call you later.
- Thanks for the coffee.

26:19.955 --> 26:21.456
You're welcome.

26:22.207 --> 26:23.709
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:31.175 --> 26:33.385
That's for me not thinking fast.

26:33.468 --> 26:36.889
- Please never think fast again.
- I'll try my hardest.

26:53.363 --> 26:55.699
- We need to talk.
- Let's talk.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.703
- Nice outfit.
- Thank you.

26:59.745 --> 27:02.331
I guess this is why you've been AWOL
the past few weeks.

27:02.414 --> 27:03.415
Pretty much.

27:03.499 --> 27:06.418
You just had the urge
to stand on another girI's shoulders?

27:06.502 --> 27:07.878
- Don't be like that.
- Like what?

27:07.920 --> 27:10.380
Like you're being.
It makes it impossible to tell you.

27:10.422 --> 27:12.049
- You didn't tell me.
- I know.

27:12.090 --> 27:14.009
- Why?
- Because.

27:14.092 --> 27:17.054
Have you thought of being a prosecutor?
You have real potential.

27:17.137 --> 27:19.431
I didn't tell you,
since I knew you'd act like this.

27:19.473 --> 27:22.059
No. I'm acting like this
because you didn't tell me.

27:22.142 --> 27:25.729
If I'd come up to you and said,
'I want to become a cheerleader'...

27:25.812 --> 27:27.606
- you would have said...
- Why?

27:27.648 --> 27:30.651
- Exactly.
- Exactly what? Lane, this is weird.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.611
We always used to make fun
of cheerleaders.

27:32.653 --> 27:35.656
We would rag on Janie Fertman
and hide during pep rallies.

27:35.739 --> 27:39.701
And now all of a sudden, you're peppy.

27:39.827 --> 27:41.995
- I'm not peppy.
- You look peppy.

27:42.496 --> 27:45.332
- You're not around much anymore.
- So this is my fault?

27:45.415 --> 27:47.709
- And you have Dean.
- This is his fault?

27:47.876 --> 27:51.547
I don't know why. I just wanted to do it.
I just wanted to try it.

27:51.630 --> 27:54.800
And I don't feel like I should justify
or explain it to you...

27:54.842 --> 27:56.510
- Then don't.
- Fine. I won't.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.303
- Okay.
- All right.

28:00.764 --> 28:02.808
- I forgot my pom.
- Your what?

28:02.891 --> 28:04.977
Two are pompoms. One's a pom.

28:07.646 --> 28:10.566
- How's it look?
- It's dark. Hand me the flashlight.

28:11.483 --> 28:13.819
Why don't you have those hats
with lights on them?

28:13.902 --> 28:16.405
- I flip burgers for a living.
- Right.

28:18.448 --> 28:20.325
- I think I've seen enough.
- How was it?

28:20.367 --> 28:22.369
Was there a termite
housing development under?

28:22.452 --> 28:24.830
Golf courses and condos with rec rooms?

28:24.913 --> 28:25.998
It's not too bad.

28:26.081 --> 28:28.167
What do you know?
You flip burgers for a living.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.335
I mean, there's definitely a little damage.

28:30.419 --> 28:33.630
But Kirk says that the joists
were totally gone.

28:33.672 --> 28:35.424
- They are.
- And the foundation...

28:35.507 --> 28:38.177
- had lost all its structural integrity.
- That's true, too.

28:38.218 --> 28:41.180
- Great. So I'm still screwed.
- Not necessarily.

28:41.221 --> 28:45.517
I need $15,000, which I can't find,
don't have, and if I don't find...

28:45.601 --> 28:46.768
the house is gonna fall down.

28:46.852 --> 28:48.520
- I can help you.
- You can?

28:48.604 --> 28:50.522
I can get a couple guys
who can do the work.

28:50.606 --> 28:51.648
You can fix this?

28:51.690 --> 28:54.902
I can help. I know a good contractor
who did some work on the diner.

28:54.985 --> 28:57.654
- And the money?
- You won't have to deal with that now.

28:57.696 --> 29:00.532
- I won't?
- You can pay in installments if you want.

29:00.574 --> 29:03.535
Monthly, bimonthly.
Whatever you're comfortable with.

29:03.577 --> 29:05.412
Let me get this straight.

29:05.496 --> 29:08.290
You and some guys
who actually know what they're doing...

29:08.373 --> 29:10.626
are gonna come over, fix my house...

29:10.709 --> 29:13.045
- and I pay them back whenever I want?
- That's right.

29:13.086 --> 29:15.506
- 'Cause I'm Tony Soprano?
- Only scarier.

29:15.589 --> 29:19.176
Luke, when I finally do make out
this installment check...

29:19.259 --> 29:20.802
who should I make it out to?

29:20.886 --> 29:24.097
You can make it out to me if you like.

29:25.057 --> 29:27.809
So basically you would be
fronting me the money?

29:28.602 --> 29:31.563
Yeah. But it's no big deal.

29:31.980 --> 29:33.774
- Luke, that's a loan.
- No.

29:33.857 --> 29:37.319
It's just a temporary exchange of money
for services...

29:37.402 --> 29:41.406
that will be paid back when you finally
have the... It's a loan.

29:42.032 --> 29:44.034
Man, you suck as a liar.

29:44.952 --> 29:47.037
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:47.454 --> 29:50.207
- I can't take it.
- I know, but it was worth a shot.

29:50.249 --> 29:51.959
Dean called twice.

29:54.586 --> 29:56.547
- You two...
- Don't ask.

29:58.757 --> 30:00.676
What are you gonna do?

30:10.310 --> 30:12.896
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where Mr. Hahn's office is?

30:12.938 --> 30:15.399
- Yeah. It's right there.
- Thank you.

30:20.445 --> 30:24.408
- You're not seriously sitting there.
- No. It's a hologram. Lifelike, isn't it?

30:24.491 --> 30:26.368
Mom, why are you here?

30:26.451 --> 30:28.245
I wanted to see if you'd show up.

30:28.287 --> 30:29.580
- I did.
- I see.

30:29.621 --> 30:32.124
You made this appointment for me,
not you.

30:32.166 --> 30:36.003
I did. But I know Miles,
and I thought my presence in there...

30:36.086 --> 30:37.921
- In where?
- In the meeting.

30:37.963 --> 30:40.841
- Okay. Bye.
- Where are you going?

30:40.924 --> 30:42.509
Come back here, Lorelai.

30:43.218 --> 30:46.763
- Lorelai, stop. Will you stop already?
- I'm leaving, Mom.

30:46.805 --> 30:49.141
- Because I'm here?
- This is a business meeting.

30:49.224 --> 30:52.978
I'm not going in with my mommy,
especially since I left my blankie at home.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.814
- You're stubborn and shortsighted.
- Call it what you want.

30:55.856 --> 30:59.443
I don't understand why you let your pride
keep you from fixing your home.

30:59.484 --> 31:02.488
I don't understand why you can't
stop yourself from butting in...

31:02.571 --> 31:04.990
- where you don't belong.
- I made this appointment.

31:05.073 --> 31:06.783
- Against my will.
- You needed it.

31:06.825 --> 31:10.287
- I didn't ask for it.
- This man could solve your problems.

31:10.370 --> 31:14.166
- Don't you understand that?
- Fine. I'll go in. You go home.

31:14.208 --> 31:17.961
I can't go home now. His assistant knows
I'm here. It would be rude.

31:18.003 --> 31:20.923
Okay. Here's the deal. We will both go in.

31:21.006 --> 31:24.343
You will go in that room,
but you will not say a word.

31:24.426 --> 31:26.678
What? But I couldn't possibly...

31:26.720 --> 31:29.014
You'll say hello. You'll ask how his wife is.

31:29.056 --> 31:31.517
That's it. After that,
you will say or do nothing.

31:31.600 --> 31:35.020
You will sit in a corner, offer no opinions,
and pull a Clarence Thomas.

31:35.062 --> 31:36.355
Am I perfectly clear?

31:36.396 --> 31:38.982
- Lorelai...
- It's the only way I'm doing this.

31:39.024 --> 31:40.734
All right, I'll be quiet.

31:41.318 --> 31:43.111
I will. I promise.

31:44.863 --> 31:47.866
I swear, one of these days,
'Alice, pow! Right to the moon. '

31:47.950 --> 31:50.828
What on earth are you talking about?
Who's Alice?

31:55.040 --> 31:58.502
There you are. I thought you were here.
I come out, and you were gone.

31:58.585 --> 32:00.879
We left something in the car.

32:00.921 --> 32:04.049
She left something in the car, not me.
I never do that.

32:04.132 --> 32:07.177
That's irresponsible and forgetful.
Two things which I am not.

32:07.219 --> 32:09.471
Miles, this is my daughter Lorelai.

32:09.555 --> 32:12.850
- Hello. It's a thrill to finally meet you.
- Same here. Thank you.

32:12.891 --> 32:14.434
- Would you like coffee?
- No.

32:14.518 --> 32:17.354
- Coffee would be wonderful, thank you.
- Coming right up.

32:17.396 --> 32:19.398
What happened to you
not saying anything?

32:19.481 --> 32:22.985
Accepting coffee is being sociable.
I haven't asked about his wife yet.

32:23.068 --> 32:25.445
Coffee's on its way.
Why don't we go in and sit down?

32:25.529 --> 32:27.364
That would be lovely.

32:34.163 --> 32:36.665
So I understand that Richard's retiring.

32:36.748 --> 32:39.084
Yes. He's going to be a man of leisure.

32:39.126 --> 32:41.587
Well, how nice. Any big plans?

32:41.670 --> 32:44.173
A round-the-world trip has been discussed.

32:44.256 --> 32:46.425
- Really? Any date set?
- Not yet.

32:46.508 --> 32:49.261
- Just checking.
- Marnie, thank you.

32:49.344 --> 32:51.430
I guess we should get down to business.

32:51.513 --> 32:54.391
Your mother tells me
you're having trouble finding a loan.

32:54.433 --> 32:55.976
Yes, I am.

32:56.894 --> 33:00.772
Before we talk about this, it's so funny,
my mom has just been dying to ask you...

33:00.856 --> 33:02.691
how your wife is doing.

33:03.609 --> 33:04.860
Right, Mom?

33:05.068 --> 33:08.614
- Yes. How is Cheryl?
- She's fine.

33:08.697 --> 33:12.201
Good. Now that we got it out of the way,
about my situation.

33:12.284 --> 33:14.286
Emily tells me that you have termites.

33:14.369 --> 33:18.582
We do, and unfortunately, they have
damaged the foundation of my house.

33:18.624 --> 33:20.250
That could be terrible.

33:20.292 --> 33:23.921
Remember when you and Richard had
that foundation problem some years ago?

33:23.962 --> 33:26.256
You had a flood in your basement,
wasn't that it?

33:26.298 --> 33:28.800
- Well, actually...
- You know, Mr. Hahn...

33:28.842 --> 33:31.512
I appreciate you taking the time
to meet with me today...

33:31.595 --> 33:35.057
and I know that the only reason you did
is because of my mother...

33:35.140 --> 33:38.977
but she's really here today
as a kind of silent participant.

33:39.019 --> 33:42.814
Not even actually a participant,
just a silent.

33:44.066 --> 33:47.694
I would appreciate it if you would
treat me just like any other person...

33:47.778 --> 33:50.823
who's walking in off the street
and asking for a loan.

33:51.907 --> 33:55.828
- Of course, if that's what you'd like.
- It is. Thank you.

33:56.036 --> 33:58.121
Now, I've brought...

33:58.539 --> 34:02.334
all my previous loan documents,
and also my bank statements...

34:02.376 --> 34:05.212
numerous recommendations,
and a letter from my employer...

34:05.295 --> 34:08.674
which says she's not going to fire me
before you get your money back.

34:08.757 --> 34:11.301
You've taken out two previous loans
on this house?

34:11.342 --> 34:12.427
Yes.

34:12.511 --> 34:15.764
- This is the estimated worth of the house?
- Well, yes.

34:15.848 --> 34:17.683
This is the amount
in your savings account?

34:17.724 --> 34:18.766
Yes.

34:18.851 --> 34:20.811
- Any other accounts?
- No.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.856
- Any other collateral not listed here?
- No.

34:24.022 --> 34:27.860
Well, Miss Gilmore, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

34:29.695 --> 34:34.366
That's it? So fast? You didn't even look
at the letters of recommendation.

34:34.449 --> 34:36.493
I'm sure you're a well-liked person.

34:36.534 --> 34:39.580
Unfortunately, being well-liked
is not grounds for a loan.

34:39.663 --> 34:43.917
But I am good for the money. I pay off
all my debts, and I work really hard.

34:44.001 --> 34:48.045
I've been the executive manager of the
Independence Inn for four years now.

34:48.130 --> 34:51.175
This is not a reflection of you as a person.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.677
You simply don't have
what the bank requires...

34:53.719 --> 34:56.554
of every other person off the street
to qualify for a loan.

34:56.638 --> 34:58.891
Therefore, there's nothing I can do.

34:58.974 --> 35:01.727
Just think about this,
because I have a kid...

35:01.768 --> 35:06.190
and she's gotten used to the concept
of having a roof over her head.

35:06.231 --> 35:08.483
- I'm sorry.
- I can't leave without this loan.

35:08.567 --> 35:10.277
- I'm sorry, but...
- No, I mean it.

35:10.360 --> 35:13.363
I can't leave without knowing
there's a way to save my house...

35:13.447 --> 35:17.242
so I'm just asking you to take five minutes
and think of something...

35:17.284 --> 35:19.870
anything, that I can do to get this money.

35:20.329 --> 35:23.207
You could get someone
to co-sign the loan with you.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.213
That's it? That's my only option?

35:29.421 --> 35:31.006
I'm afraid so.

35:35.093 --> 35:37.429
You knew about this, didn't you?

35:46.188 --> 35:49.858
- Would you be willing?
- It would be my pleasure.

35:49.942 --> 35:52.861
Wonderful.
I'll have the papers drawn up today.

35:52.945 --> 35:56.448
- Would you like some more coffee?
- I would love some. Thank you.

35:59.034 --> 36:01.161
I think that went very well.

36:02.371 --> 36:04.289
- What's the new arrangement?
- Excuse me?

36:04.373 --> 36:06.792
You paid for Chilton.
I gave you Friday night dinners.

36:06.875 --> 36:09.753
- What's this, Sunday night tea?
- I did this for your own good.

36:09.795 --> 36:12.130
Wednesday night bridge club?
Monday night football?

36:12.214 --> 36:13.507
Stop it!

36:13.715 --> 36:16.635
What? Just please tell me.
What do I owe you?

36:16.718 --> 36:18.136
You owe me nothing.

36:18.178 --> 36:22.099
I just wanted to do something nice
for my daughter, that's all.

36:24.476 --> 36:27.938
It's already shaping up
to be the best season ever...

36:27.980 --> 36:32.317
due in part to the recent arrival
of our brand-new basketball coach...

36:32.359 --> 36:34.153
Lou McGillian...

36:34.194 --> 36:38.699
formally the presiding legal counsel
for the Chicago Bulls.

36:38.907 --> 36:41.702
Lou, come on up here. Take a bow.

36:42.327 --> 36:46.707
Those other teams had better watch out.
We've got one of the big boys on our side.

36:46.790 --> 36:50.377
Shaq who? In addition to our new coach...

36:50.460 --> 36:53.463
we're extremely proud
of our brand new uniforms...

36:53.505 --> 36:57.467
thoughtfully supplied by you,
the citizens of Stars Hollow...

36:57.509 --> 37:02.264
and carefully cleaned by the good people
at Tricky's Dry Cleaners.

37:02.347 --> 37:06.518
'If it's sticky, try Tricky's. '
So let's hear it for Tricky's.

37:07.936 --> 37:11.899
I'm telling you, they are terrific.
Red and white, very durable.

37:11.982 --> 37:14.860
Little stripes on the side. You know what?

37:15.068 --> 37:17.988
Why don't you just see for yourselves?
Come on.

37:18.030 --> 37:20.908
- Show them your uniforms.
- It's freezing out here.

37:21.158 --> 37:23.619
Why don't you let them see them
at the game?

37:23.702 --> 37:26.830
The people in this town
paid good money for those uniforms.

37:26.872 --> 37:29.166
You show them what they paid for.

37:30.375 --> 37:31.835
This is crazy.

37:31.877 --> 37:35.589
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the new uniforms...

37:35.672 --> 37:39.301
of the fabulous Fighting Minutemen!

37:39.718 --> 37:43.805
Look at them shivering up there.
They're such wimps these days.

37:44.097 --> 37:47.184
When I was on the team, it was different.
We were rowdy.

37:47.226 --> 37:49.728
Three of us would have been
pantsed by now.

37:53.106 --> 37:54.983
- Hey.
- I got your note.

37:55.067 --> 37:57.903
Pinning it to the Mallomars
is always a safe bet.

37:58.111 --> 37:59.780
- Coffee?
- Please.

38:02.074 --> 38:04.243
Grandma and I went to the bank today.

38:04.326 --> 38:06.119
- How did it go?
- We got the loan.

38:06.203 --> 38:09.832
- Good. So everything's okay.
- Yeah, well.

38:10.457 --> 38:14.086
- Nice uniforms.
- I'm sorry I told Grandma about it.

38:14.169 --> 38:17.631
Hon, there's gonna be a time in our lives...

38:17.714 --> 38:19.842
where occasionally
I'm gonna make a mistake.

38:19.925 --> 38:21.885
- It hasn't happened yet, but it might.
- Sure.

38:21.969 --> 38:24.763
I've earned the right to make that mistake,
and the right...

38:24.805 --> 38:28.684
- to fix any problems without interference.
- I just thought they could help.

38:28.767 --> 38:32.062
I didn't want their help.
Have you ever been without food...

38:32.104 --> 38:34.189
or clothes or books or book covers...

38:34.273 --> 38:36.233
- or anything else you ever needed?
- No.

38:36.316 --> 38:40.863
The reason for that is me. I have a good
track record for keeping you alive.

38:40.946 --> 38:42.156
Yeah, you do.

38:42.239 --> 38:44.783
When I say I can handle something,
you must respect that.

38:44.867 --> 38:48.287
Especially since you have no evidence
that I won't. Understand?

38:48.370 --> 38:53.041
- Yeah. I understand. I'm sorry.
- I officially declare this fight over.

38:53.125 --> 38:54.585
I'll drink to that.

38:55.294 --> 38:57.629
Stars Hollow High. Let's hear it!

38:57.713 --> 39:00.424
- Stars Hollow High!
- Is that Lane?

39:01.758 --> 39:05.137
- Stars Hollow High!
- Yeah, that's Lane.

39:48.680 --> 39:52.476
When some loud braggart
starts to put me down

39:52.518 --> 39:54.686
And says his school is great

39:54.770 --> 39:56.855
I tell him right away

39:56.939 --> 40:00.108
'What's the matter, buddy?
Ain't you heard of my school?

40:00.192 --> 40:02.569
'It's number one in the state'

40:04.238 --> 40:06.198
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:06.865 --> 40:09.409
- The music selection, yours, I assume?
- Yeah.

40:09.493 --> 40:11.995
There's a bit of an education process
going on.

40:12.037 --> 40:15.666
- I liked it. Very John Waters.
- Thank you.

40:15.958 --> 40:18.502
I don't want you to think
that you can't tell me things.

40:18.544 --> 40:21.672
- I don't want to not tell you things.
- This cheerleading thing...

40:21.713 --> 40:23.632
- I know. It's weird.
- It's not weird.

40:23.715 --> 40:26.969
If you were doing it professionally,
it would be weird. But this?

40:27.052 --> 40:28.804
- It looked fun.
- It was fun.

40:28.887 --> 40:30.889
You got them to cheer to madness...

40:30.973 --> 40:33.016
so there must be some hope
left in the world.

40:33.100 --> 40:36.520
Rest assured that I remain me:
A Nico-obsessed, Exene wannabe...

40:36.562 --> 40:40.232
with 40 Korean Bibles under her bed.
I just bounce a little more.

40:40.440 --> 40:43.527
- Can cheerleaders get coffee?
- Yeah. Coffee's a must.

40:43.610 --> 40:45.654
- Yeah?
- It keeps you perky.

40:48.282 --> 40:51.618
So be true to your school now

40:51.785 --> 40:55.581
Just like you would to your girl or guy

40:55.789 --> 40:58.876
Be true to your school

40:59.001 --> 41:02.296
And let your colors fly

41:02.671 --> 41:07.301
Be true to your school

41:16.894 --> 41:19.521
Mom, they started work
on the house yesterday.

41:20.731 --> 41:24.193
- Good.
- These guys come at the crack of dawn...

41:24.318 --> 41:28.113
and all of a sudden there's all this
hammering and drilling and dust flying.

41:28.197 --> 41:30.741
- It's pretty impressive.
- They're a nice bunch, too.

41:30.824 --> 41:34.953
And the best part is, I've been out there
ten times to bring them coffee...

41:35.037 --> 41:37.372
- and I haven't seen a butt crack yet.
- How nice.

41:37.456 --> 41:40.167
They should paint that slogan
on their truck. Excuse me.

41:40.250 --> 41:43.045
- Where you going?
- To get some more bread.

41:45.297 --> 41:48.175
- I think I'll go help.
- That would be good.

41:58.810 --> 42:02.773
- Mom, I want to apologize to you.
- For what?

42:04.483 --> 42:07.653
For doubting your motives
in this whole loan thing.

42:07.736 --> 42:11.031
I'm not used to people doing things
without strings attached.

42:11.114 --> 42:12.574
By 'people' you mean me.

42:12.658 --> 42:16.245
I don't know what I would have done
without your help. I mean it.

42:16.745 --> 42:20.499
I was out of ideas, and then
out of the blue, you make this call...

42:20.541 --> 42:24.127
and co-sign the loan with me.
I'm really, really grateful.

42:26.171 --> 42:28.507
- That almost sounded sincere.
- Yeah.

42:28.590 --> 42:32.594
I should have left off one of the 'really's.
That always tips it.

42:33.053 --> 42:35.472
- All right. I accept your apology.
- Thank you.

42:35.514 --> 42:39.226
I'm going to be having my DAR meetings
at the inn from now on.

42:39.309 --> 42:40.894
I hope you don't mind.

42:44.606 --> 42:46.024
She's good.

43:28.442 --> 43:29.443
