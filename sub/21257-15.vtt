**

00:08.442 --> 00:09.410
(knocking)

00:10.744 --> 00:12.113
(door opening)

00:13.581 --> 00:15.883
Thanks for letting me use the
lab on the weekend, Dr. Sherman.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.052
Of course, Winnie,
we want all the students

00:18.086 --> 00:20.554
competing in this year's
West Haven Science Competition

00:20.588 --> 00:22.423
to feel supported.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.158
How's your research
project coming along?

00:24.192 --> 00:25.659
Oh, it's very promising.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.660
I'm gunning to win
this thing.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.429
Oh, great, well,
good luck.

00:28.462 --> 00:31.399
I'd offer to stay and help
but Sunday is my fun day.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.034
So, I'm just gonna leave you
here to use the lab

00:34.068 --> 00:35.369
completely unsupervised.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.037
Thanks.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.708
Let's get to work, Carl.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.443
(Carl squeaks)
(Winnie)
If my hypothesis is correct,

00:42.476 --> 00:44.945
my project will blow everyone
else's out of the water.

00:44.978 --> 00:48.516
And then I'll get into the
university of my choice...

00:48.549 --> 00:51.119
and be on the path to becoming
a groundbreaking scientist

00:51.152 --> 00:53.287
just like my heroes.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.756
I'll follow in the
footsteps of Marie Curie

00:55.789 --> 00:56.957
and Mimi Phipps Clark.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.360
And do research
to benefit mankind.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.130
Because Carl, in a world
filled with ambiguity,

01:02.163 --> 01:03.631
science is always right.

01:03.664 --> 01:07.135
Actually... Science
gets it wrong all the time!

01:07.168 --> 01:08.336
Mother physics!

01:10.138 --> 01:13.874
Wait, are you Adam
from TV?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.709
Oh, you watch the show.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.278
Yeah, when
"Myth Busters" isn't on.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.812
Now those guys
are smart.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.648
Well, wanna
do the honors?

01:20.681 --> 01:22.250
Sure.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.318
Hi, I'm Winnie Jones
and this is Adam Conover,

01:24.352 --> 01:27.155
and I'm on
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:27.188 --> 01:28.289
Uh-oh.

01:28.322 --> 01:31.259

01:37.865 --> 01:39.833
Adam, I've
seen your show.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.135
It's about proving
things wrong.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.404
But you can't do
that to science.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.406
Science is how we find out
the truth about the world.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.507
Yes, it is.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.343
But the way we do science
is often flawed.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.011
Well, not here,
it isn't.

01:51.044 --> 01:54.182
Carl and I are working on a very
exciting, very solid study

01:54.215 --> 01:57.151
about how Vitamin D affects
human memory retention.
Oh.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.820
(squeaking)
Yes, you are a good
little test subject.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.689
Actually, if you're trying
to learn about humans,

02:01.722 --> 02:03.991
he's a terrible
little test subject.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.493
(loud squeaking)

02:05.526 --> 02:06.527
Sorry.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.796
What? Everyone knows
testing on rodents

02:08.829 --> 02:11.332
is practically the same
as doing actual human trials.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.867
Yes, everyone
"knows" that.

02:13.901 --> 02:17.705
Too bad
they're wrong.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.708
Cool! I've always
wanted to be a B-A-L-B-C-J

02:20.741 --> 02:22.643
laboratory mouse.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.512
But what
are we doing here?

02:24.545 --> 02:26.880
The same thing we do
every night, Winnie.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.450
Ruining a common
misconception.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.884
(thunder crashes)

02:30.918 --> 02:34.688
Rodents make up 95%
of all animals

02:34.722 --> 02:37.057
used for biomedical
research in America.

02:37.090 --> 02:40.461
That's 20 to 30
million mice a year.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.063
Whoa, they must be such
effective test subjects.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.165
Actually,
they're not.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.901
Out of all clinical trials
based on mouse models,

02:47.935 --> 02:52.072
the results don't apply to
humans over 80% of the time.

02:52.105 --> 02:55.643
Well, time to file these.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.077
(Adam)
And those failed trials

02:57.110 --> 03:00.414
can cause hundreds
of millions of dollars a piece.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.217
And this drives up
the cost of development.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.553
Meaning we get fewer
new drugs.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.521
Yeah, we're out of funding.
(grumbling through phone)

03:07.555 --> 03:09.757
Well, then tell
the cancer patients

03:09.790 --> 03:12.260
they'll have
to wait, Pete!

03:12.293 --> 03:14.194
But how can that be?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.930
I read mice share
97% of DNA with humans.

03:16.964 --> 03:21.034
True, but that 3%
makes a big difference.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.104
Mouse metabolisms are seven
times faster.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.873
We have different
inflammation reactions.

03:25.906 --> 03:29.209
And, you know, people are over
3,000 times bigger.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.778
(gasps)
(squeaking)

03:30.811 --> 03:32.079
(Adam)
And our bodies can have

03:32.112 --> 03:34.382
very different reactions
to medicine.

03:34.415 --> 03:38.118
In one extreme example
from 2006, a new cancer drug

03:38.151 --> 03:41.121
was tested in mice and
passed with flying colors.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.857
But when human subjects
were injected with just

03:43.891 --> 03:45.626
1/500th of a mouse dosage,

03:45.659 --> 03:48.195
within hours,
all of the volunteers

03:48.228 --> 03:51.265
went into catastrophic,
multi-organ failure

03:51.299 --> 03:53.301
and had to be rushed
to the ICU.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.302
Oh.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.736
The truth is,
testing on mice

03:55.769 --> 03:58.972
just doesn't tell us
as much about humans
as we think it does.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.208
Jeez Louise.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.944
So, why do we even use mice
in the first place?

04:03.977 --> 04:06.280
Because they're cheap
and convenient.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.449
Compared to other
animal test subjects,

04:08.482 --> 04:09.983
mice are a bargain.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.320
And they're great in a lab
setting because they're easy

04:12.353 --> 04:15.155
to tame and store
and they breed like crazy.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.490
Congratulations!

04:16.524 --> 04:17.891
It's 100!

04:17.925 --> 04:21.261
Rodents are also super easy
to genetically customize.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.830
Want a mouse
with no immune system?

04:22.863 --> 04:24.665
Or how about one
that glows in the dark.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.067
Extra tumors
strike your fancy?

04:27.100 --> 04:30.003
You can have whatever model
of mouse you want.

04:30.037 --> 04:33.273
Finally, the Animal Welfare Act,
the only federal law

04:33.307 --> 04:36.844
that covers testing on animals
doesn't protect mice at all.

04:36.877 --> 04:37.845
(screaming)

04:37.878 --> 04:39.146
Oh, yeah,

04:39.179 --> 04:41.349
we can never get away
with this on a rabbit.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.254
So, even though we know
testing on mice is a problem,

04:47.287 --> 04:49.857
we keep doing it anyways
'cause it's easier?

04:49.890 --> 04:50.991
(woman)
And at this point,

04:51.024 --> 04:53.126
it's almost impossible not to.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.828
Ah, Winnie, this is...

04:54.862 --> 04:56.296
Dr. Azra Raza,

04:56.330 --> 04:59.433
Director of the Myelodysplastic
Syndrome Center at Columbia!

04:59.467 --> 05:01.201
I traded six
Albert Einsteins for her.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.370
(Dr. Raza)
Thanks, Winnie!

05:02.403 --> 05:05.038
And thanks for keeping me
in mint condition.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.041
Medical science is almost
entirely built

05:08.075 --> 05:09.643
around mouse testing.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.479
Researchers have been using mice

05:11.512 --> 05:12.946
since the 1800s.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.548
And students are taught on them

05:14.582 --> 05:16.016
from day one of school.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.451
And most
other testing methods

05:17.485 --> 05:19.219
are prohibitively expensive.

05:19.252 --> 05:22.656
You quite literally cannot
do a study without mice.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.324
At the moment
in the United States,

05:24.358 --> 05:27.528
the FDA will almost
never approve a trial in humans

05:27.561 --> 05:30.731
unless researchers have
done it in rodents first.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.834
The real problem is cancer
research has become

05:33.867 --> 05:37.905
so mouse centric, we cannot
replace rodent testing

05:37.938 --> 05:39.973
without overhauling
the whole system.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.241
Which is a shame.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.411
Because if we want
to cure cancer in humans,

05:43.444 --> 05:46.179
we should be studying
human cancer cells.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.817
We are wasting valuable
resources and time on mice.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.918
(squeaking)

05:50.951 --> 05:53.554
Hey, come on!
This is a family show.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.855
(sighs)

05:54.888 --> 05:55.923
Thanks, Doctor Raza.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.257
You're welcome.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.559
And here's another tip.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.093
If you put me
in your bike spoke,

06:00.127 --> 06:02.262
it will sound
like a motorcycle.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.666
(mimicking motor puttering)

06:05.699 --> 06:07.701
(sighs)

06:07.735 --> 06:08.702
(books thud to floor)

06:08.736 --> 06:10.571
Now my whole project
isn't useable.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.105
Well, you don't have to throw
out all of your work.

06:12.139 --> 06:16.744
Nope! I am gonna start
a new project from scratch.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.279
I mean, might
as well get used to it.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.581
When I'm a scientist,

06:20.614 --> 06:22.516
I'll be doing nothing
but science all day.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.751
Not quite.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.218
Want me to tell you
about it?

06:25.252 --> 06:27.688
Couldn't you have found
a cool kid to mess with?

06:27.721 --> 06:29.089
(whistling theme)

06:31.992 --> 06:34.562
You know, Winnie, the reality
working as a scientist

06:34.595 --> 06:36.797
might not be quite
what you expect.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.965
Very funny, Adam.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.033
You're a real Humphry Davy.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.203
The chemist who discovered the
effects of laughing gas? Hello?

06:43.236 --> 06:46.807
I know exactly what life
as a scientist will be like.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.243
I'll spend my days investigating
the big unanswered questions.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.412
I'll follow the research
wherever it leads,

06:52.446 --> 06:54.214
beholden to nothing
and no one

06:54.247 --> 06:57.551
but the pursuit
of pure scientific truth.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.052
That's a beautiful dream.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.255
But in reality, what science
you get to do depends a lot

07:02.289 --> 07:04.091
on who gives you
money to do it.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.893
'Cause if you wanna pursue
scientific truth,

07:05.926 --> 07:08.829
first you gotta find someone
willing to pay for it.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.833
Around two-thirds of basic
research is privately funded.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.468
But here's the problem.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.804
The priorities of the people
handing out the funding

07:16.837 --> 07:21.141
often affect what
research gets done.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.743
(announcer)
Welcome to "Smart Tank."

07:22.776 --> 07:25.946
Today the Smarts will hear
a proposal from Winnie,

07:25.979 --> 07:27.615
a young researcher competing

07:27.648 --> 07:30.918
in the West Haven
Science Competition.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.952
Hello, Smarts.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.187
Uh, today, I'm asking
for funding

07:34.221 --> 07:36.023
for my biomedical research.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.025
Here's my proposal.

07:38.058 --> 07:42.429
You'll find it's very exciting
and worthwhile.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.331
First up, a major funder
of research,

07:44.364 --> 07:45.933
corporate America.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.502
Winnie, we might be able
to help you.

07:48.536 --> 07:51.004
I just have one question.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.873
Is this gonna help us
sell more candy bars?

07:52.906 --> 07:55.142
No... Why?

07:55.175 --> 07:56.977
Well, corporations
and trade groups

07:57.010 --> 07:59.547
tend to fund research
that will make them money.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.783
In 2011, the National
Confectioners Association

08:02.816 --> 08:04.184
paid for a study

08:04.217 --> 08:08.789
that implied eating sweets
actually makes kids skinnier.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.390
If you can't provide
that kind of return

08:10.423 --> 08:12.960
on investment, I'm out.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.895
Well, I see plenty
of upside.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.898
Your research can help us
develop new drugs.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.032
Really?

08:19.066 --> 08:20.167
Sure.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.002
And if your results make
our drugs look good,

08:22.035 --> 08:23.236
we'll publish them.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.672
Otherwise we'll bury them

08:24.705 --> 08:27.174
so the results will never
be seen. (chuckles)

08:27.207 --> 08:28.909
Yeah, they actually
do that.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.243
Well, that's wrong.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.045
I won't be a part of it.

08:32.079 --> 08:35.082
Oh, an idealist.
I'm out.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.817
Well, there's
two Smarts left.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.753
Okay, another major source
of funding is philanthropy.

08:39.787 --> 08:43.323
Winnie, I apologize for my
robber baron friends here.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.426
You and I, we're in it
to help people.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.061
See? This lady gets me.

08:48.095 --> 08:51.264
Sure, and philanthropic donors
fund some worthy research.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.567
But they're also more
likely to give money

08:53.601 --> 08:56.269
to causes that have
affected them personally.

08:56.303 --> 08:59.840
You have to use this to find
a cure for diamond allergies.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.108
(loud sneeze)

09:01.141 --> 09:05.078
Or maybe I could study diabetes
or sickle cell anemia?

09:05.112 --> 09:08.115
Oh, sorry, sweetie, I'm out.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.683
This is a travesty.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.919
Isn't anyone willing
to fund objective,

09:11.952 --> 09:13.954
independent,
unglamorous research?

09:13.987 --> 09:17.024
Yes, there is one final
funding source.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.059
Public funding.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.460
Also is Mark Cuban here

09:20.493 --> 09:22.963
because I would, like,
die if I met Mark Cuban.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.565
Because government funding
isn't controlled by profits

09:25.599 --> 09:28.802
or the whims of one person,
it supports the unsexy

09:28.836 --> 09:32.472
yet vital basic research
that all science builds upon.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.808
And it's led
to advances like...

09:34.842 --> 09:37.477
Heart rate monitors,
the Human Genome Project,

09:37.510 --> 09:40.313
audio recording,
water purification, satellites,

09:40.347 --> 09:44.718
solar panels, super computers,
GPS and the internet.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.787
Just to name a few.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.823
Even Google got its start
with a government grant.

09:49.857 --> 09:52.626
But you won't see that on the
first page of search results.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.895
Wow, sounds like public
funding is awesome.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.164
Finally a funding
source with no downsides.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.000
Well... there is
one little wrinkle.

10:00.033 --> 10:04.271
Federal science budgets are
controlled by politicians.

10:04.304 --> 10:08.408
I hereby award you, Winnie,
this government grant for--

10:08.441 --> 10:09.743
(whispering)
What's that, Senator?

10:09.777 --> 10:12.746
You'd rather have tax cuts
than scientific knowledge?

10:12.780 --> 10:15.949
And there's a powerful lobby
that won't like the research?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.517
And you don't know
enough about science

10:17.550 --> 10:20.153
to care
about the consequences?

10:20.187 --> 10:21.188
(sighs)

10:21.221 --> 10:22.255
Sorry, I'm out.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.124
No! This work
is worth the money.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.126
Ask any scientist,
they'll tell you.

10:26.159 --> 10:30.430
Sorry, politicians tell me
what to do, not scientists.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.499
Maybe not the best system.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.367
But science
needs the money.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.136
Yes, it does.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.039
Private funding will never be
enough to support research

10:39.072 --> 10:40.708
in the public interest.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.177
The kind of long-term careful
science that doesn't generate

10:44.211 --> 10:47.347
profits or glory,
but improves people's lives

10:47.380 --> 10:50.183
and increases our understanding
of the universe.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.787
We need public funding
for science.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.322
But in the past 50 years,

10:55.355 --> 10:56.957
the portion of the
discretionary budget

10:56.990 --> 10:58.792
that government spends
on research and development

10:58.826 --> 11:01.394
has been cut nearly in half.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.063
And with less funding,

11:03.096 --> 11:06.166
there's more competition
for fewer resources.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.567
In the past two decades,

11:07.600 --> 11:10.303
30% of National Health Institute
grants got funded.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.906
But today,
it's about 17%.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.675
No, no, no!

11:15.709 --> 11:19.646
And from 2010 to 2013,
the U.S. had the biggest

11:19.679 --> 11:22.049
three-year reduction
of scientific research

11:22.082 --> 11:25.252
and development since
the end of the space race.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.621
(sighs)

11:31.258 --> 11:32.492
But if it's so hard
to get funding,

11:32.525 --> 11:33.927
then how do we do science?

11:33.961 --> 11:36.663
Well, sometimes
we just don't.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.266
In a recent study
of 11,000 scientists,

11:39.299 --> 11:41.601
half of them said they've
had to stop doing

11:41.634 --> 11:43.403
valuable research
partway through

11:43.436 --> 11:46.073
because of economic pressures.

11:46.106 --> 11:49.509
Who knows what
great advancements
we lost out on as a result.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.179
As much as we'd love to believe
that the progress of science

11:52.212 --> 11:54.748
is determined solely
by the best and brightest,

11:54.782 --> 11:57.617
decisions about which
science gets funded

11:57.650 --> 12:00.453
have always been controlled
by non-scientists.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.389
It's all about who holds
the purse strings.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.793
That may be true but science
always triumphs in the end.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.962
Look at all these journals.

12:08.996 --> 12:13.100
Great, factual peer reviewed
research is published every day.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.768
(sucking teeth) Ah...

12:14.802 --> 12:16.436
Ugh.
What?

12:16.469 --> 12:19.472
Nothing, just that a surprising
number of scientific studies

12:19.506 --> 12:22.175
do not... hold up.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.677
(screaming)

12:27.848 --> 12:29.049
Oh!
Excuse me.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.650
I'm using those studies
for my project.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.485
Go ahead, but there's
a good chance

12:32.519 --> 12:34.154
a lot of those studies
are wrong.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.256
Adam, please, when a study
has been published,

12:36.289 --> 12:38.625
that means its data
is robust and accurate.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.928
Winnie, if you'd ever read
"US Weekly", you'd know

12:40.961 --> 12:42.562
that just 'cause something
is published,

12:42.595 --> 12:43.663
that doesn't mean
it's true.

12:43.696 --> 12:46.433
What's "US Weekly?"

12:46.466 --> 12:48.468
Wow, you are nerdier
than I am. (chuckles)

12:51.671 --> 12:54.407
Studies can be flawed
for a number of reasons.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.310
**

12:59.346 --> 13:01.514
If the sample size
was too small,

13:01.548 --> 13:04.251
the luck of the draw
could've skewed the results.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.687
We should test this
on 10,000 people but...

13:07.720 --> 13:09.857
I only know ten.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.159
That's okay,
making friends is hard.

13:12.192 --> 13:15.095
(Adam)
Or maybe there was
a confounding variable.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.164
Like, if the subject was
using another product

13:17.197 --> 13:18.365
that could affect the results

13:18.398 --> 13:20.700
and the researchers
didn't account for it.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.702
Oh, wow,
this pill is really

13:22.735 --> 13:25.072
boosting our subject's
resistance to sunburn.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.309
(Adam)
And something, very rarely,

13:29.342 --> 13:32.512
unscrupulous researchers
will fake their results.

13:32.545 --> 13:33.981
What if we just make up numbers

13:34.014 --> 13:35.815
that show that this pill
cures cancer?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.019
Hello?
Nobel Prize committee?

13:39.052 --> 13:40.687
I've got some data
you've gotta see.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.389
Sure, so we just
need a way to find out

13:42.422 --> 13:43.790
which studies
are accurate.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.726
We already have one.
And that's to reproduce them.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.162
To show the results
weren't just some fluke,

13:49.196 --> 13:51.198
someone else
has to do another study

13:51.231 --> 13:52.900
that tests the same question

13:52.933 --> 13:55.402
to see if they can get
the same findings.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.404
It's like double checking
the answers.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.673
Curse, my results
were way different.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.075
And here's the problem.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.177
Since studies
are usually reproduced

14:04.211 --> 14:05.645
after they're published,

14:05.678 --> 14:06.980
that means they have a chance

14:07.014 --> 14:10.250
to influence other research
or even become famous

14:10.283 --> 14:12.585
before we find out
they're wrong.

14:12.619 --> 14:15.889
For instance, remember that
famous study on power posing.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.591
Uh, it's only one of the most
watched TED Talks of all time.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.560
It proved that by standing
in the power pose,

14:20.593 --> 14:22.896
your body produces hormones
that give you confidence.

14:22.930 --> 14:26.033
Well, no one's ever been able
to reproduce those results.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.067
What?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.401
Or how about that series
of studies

14:28.435 --> 14:29.736
from the '70s and '80s

14:29.769 --> 14:32.439
that showed you can actually
make yourself feel happier

14:32.472 --> 14:34.041
just by smiling?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.909
Well, that makes sense, right?

14:35.943 --> 14:39.279
Sure, except that in 2016,
almost 20 labs tried

14:39.312 --> 14:41.214
to replicate it
and not one of them

14:41.248 --> 14:43.016
was able to reproduce
those findings.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.684
(train whistle blows)

14:44.717 --> 14:46.253
Holy Hawking!

14:46.286 --> 14:48.922
If that's true, then how many
other studies might be wrong?

14:48.956 --> 14:50.123
Oh, a lot of them.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.425
In fact, many scientists
say that we're in the midst

14:52.459 --> 14:55.862
of a reproducibility crisis.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.966
Like a good type
of crisis, right?

14:58.999 --> 15:02.369
One research team just
replicated 100 famous psychology

15:02.402 --> 15:06.406
studies but found they couldn't
reproduce about 60% of them.

15:07.474 --> 15:08.408
(beep)

15:09.943 --> 15:12.812
Another revisited 67
major drug studies

15:12.845 --> 15:16.349
and found that about 75%
didn't match their results.

15:19.186 --> 15:22.322
And another team zeroed
on 53 recent cancer studies

15:22.355 --> 15:25.492
and couldn't
reproduce 47 of them.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.996
(beep, loud explosion)

15:29.029 --> 15:31.264
But those numbers
are so high!

15:31.298 --> 15:33.000
If science gets
it wrong that often,

15:33.033 --> 15:35.502
then we should be reproducing
every study.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.305
(man)
That'd be nice,
but it probably won't happen.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.608
There... and that's how
you fold a fitted sheet.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.177
This is Professor Nosek.
of the University of Virginia.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.346
And the co-founder
of the Center for Open Science.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.015
Adam's right, Winnie.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.183
Replication studies
are not getting done.

15:50.217 --> 15:53.086
And it's because scientists
don't have enough good reasons
to do them.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.687
Wait, what do you mean?

15:54.721 --> 15:57.024
To succeed in their careers,
scientists have to publish

15:57.057 --> 15:58.758
and get attention
for their research.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.360
And that's more likely
to happen

16:00.393 --> 16:03.630
if their studies have new
and flashy conclusions.

16:03.663 --> 16:07.334
My study found that Fidget
Spinners give you six-pack abs.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.369
(crowd gasps and applauds)

16:09.402 --> 16:11.204
And the pressure to get
these kinds of results

16:11.238 --> 16:14.374
sometimes leads researchers
to cut corners.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.009
I didn't need
test subjects.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.377
I just asked my bro, Kevin.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.379
He's super ripped.

16:19.412 --> 16:22.949
On the other hand, replication
studies make for good science.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.451
But they don't get
as much attention.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.319
People just aren't
interested in studies

16:26.353 --> 16:27.887
that don't
find anything new.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.290
And I replicated a 2003 study

16:30.323 --> 16:34.294
on classification of
fine-grained polypeptide folds.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.395
The results held up.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.963
(crickets chirping, man coughs)

16:36.996 --> 16:39.699
Hey, her work is just
as important.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.069
Yeah, but it isn't
as exciting.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.503
Science is competitive.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.738
There aren't enough jobs or
grant dollars for everyone.

16:45.772 --> 16:49.409
So, if you were trying to get
people excited about your
research, what would you do?

16:49.442 --> 16:51.411
Follow-up on someone's
prior findings?

16:51.444 --> 16:53.580
Or try to find something new
and amazing?

16:53.613 --> 16:56.649
I, uh, also did
a study that found...

16:56.683 --> 16:58.085
candy cures leukemia!

16:58.118 --> 17:00.220
(crowd gasps and applauds)

17:00.253 --> 17:01.588
(shutters clicking)

17:01.621 --> 17:05.858
These incentives to publish lead
to a lot of unreliable research.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.894
One estimate suggest
that in the U.S.,

17:07.927 --> 17:11.564
we spend $28 billion a year
on biomedical research

17:11.598 --> 17:13.533
that can't be reproduced.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.001
That's such a waste!

17:15.034 --> 17:17.504
Well, flashy findings
can be useful

17:17.537 --> 17:19.406
for stimulating
new areas of discovery.

17:19.439 --> 17:22.109
But we need to change the
incentives so that researchers

17:22.142 --> 17:23.743
are rewarded
for producing results

17:23.776 --> 17:26.746
that are interesting
and reproducible.

17:26.779 --> 17:27.880
Thanks, Professor Nosek.

17:27.914 --> 17:28.881
No problem.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.083
Now if you'll excuse me,

17:30.117 --> 17:32.219
I'm gonna go use
the emergency shower.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.221
I save a ton
on my water bill.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.356
Oh, thrifty.
(chuckling)

17:36.389 --> 17:39.259
So, even if my research
gets positive results,

17:39.292 --> 17:41.128
I still have to find
someone to reproduce it,

17:41.161 --> 17:42.795
but no one will because
they only care about

17:42.829 --> 17:44.497
their own careers?

17:46.499 --> 17:48.935
Wait, what are you doing?

17:48.968 --> 17:49.969
You're right, Adam.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.771
Science sucks, I'm done.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.306
I'm gonna go drink some
Red Bull in the woods

17:53.340 --> 17:55.142
or do whatever cool kids do.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.643
Oh, wait!

17:56.676 --> 17:59.546
I was about to tell you why
science is actually amazing!

17:59.579 --> 18:02.014
I thought you knew
the structure of my show!

18:05.585 --> 18:06.986
**

18:07.019 --> 18:09.189
(birds chirping)

18:10.423 --> 18:11.591
You forgot this.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.592
I don't need it.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.094
I'm quitting the competition.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.897
You know, I used to love
that no matter how chaotic

18:17.930 --> 18:19.466
and uncertain the world felt,

18:19.499 --> 18:22.135
I could at least count on
science to always be right.

18:22.169 --> 18:25.305
But you showed me,
it's not.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.510
Winnie, do you know
why science is so awesome?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.145
It's the field
of human inquiry

18:32.179 --> 18:35.348
that embraces mistakes
and learns from them.

18:35.382 --> 18:38.818
Scientists don't just assert
what they think is true.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.754
They test their hypotheses
against the empirical evidence.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.590
And if it turns out
they're wrong,

18:43.623 --> 18:45.958
they admit it
and try again.

18:45.992 --> 18:48.695
The fact that science
seeks out its own errors

18:48.728 --> 18:51.864
and corrects them
is its greatest strength.

18:51.898 --> 18:55.368
But how do we fix what's
wrong with science itself?

18:55.402 --> 18:57.370
With more science.
With more science.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.706
When I learned about
the reproducibility challenges

18:59.739 --> 19:01.774
in science, I thought
we need to study this problem.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.976
So we started
The Center for Open Science

19:04.010 --> 19:07.614
to investigate why is it that
researchers are not producing

19:07.647 --> 19:09.716
reproducible science
even though they want to?

19:09.749 --> 19:11.284
So, we built software

19:11.318 --> 19:13.553
so that researchers
can share their data more easily

19:13.586 --> 19:16.022
and be more transparent
in their methods.

19:16.055 --> 19:19.192
We also work with journals
and societies and funders

19:19.226 --> 19:23.129
to align the incentives so that
it's in researchers interests

19:23.162 --> 19:25.332
to be more open
and reproducible in their work.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.134
And when I first emigrated
here from Pakistan,

19:28.167 --> 19:31.037
I had no idea how much research
in the U.S.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.740
rested on flawed mouse testing.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.643
To combat this problem,
I started to collect
human tissue,

19:36.676 --> 19:38.745
and this is how I found

19:38.778 --> 19:41.314
a novel treatment
for pre-leukemia.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.317
Whoa.
So, if something
in science is broken

19:44.351 --> 19:46.386
like mouse models
or faulty studies,

19:46.419 --> 19:47.887
it doesn't mean we failed.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.991
It means we need people like you
to find the solution by using...

19:52.024 --> 19:53.059
Science!

19:53.092 --> 19:54.361
(all)
Yes!

19:54.394 --> 19:55.362
You're right!

19:55.395 --> 19:58.097
I have to use science
to fix science.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.266
Eureka!

19:59.299 --> 20:00.867
Thank you, guys.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.273
(faint chatter)

20:07.807 --> 20:10.176
And finally... Winnie.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.545
And your project is...

20:12.579 --> 20:14.113
Wait, where is your project?

20:14.146 --> 20:16.816
Dr. Sherman,
I didn't do a project.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.219
I did 19.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.388
Because for my experiment,

20:21.421 --> 20:23.390
I replicated
everyone else's research,

20:23.423 --> 20:26.526
and I found that all
of their conclusions were...

20:26.559 --> 20:28.060
irreproducible.

20:30.062 --> 20:34.934
Wow, well, that doesn't quite
follow the project guidelines.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.704
But, nice work, Winnie.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.138
Sorry, everyone else.

20:39.171 --> 20:42.275
(muffled grumbling)

20:42.309 --> 20:44.277
You suck.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.813
Well, I didn't do it
for the glory.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.148
I did it for science.

20:49.181 --> 20:51.284
Come on, Adam, I'll show you
my new research proposal.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.286
I got some sweet
new binder tabs.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.054
Ooh, I love office supplies.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.155
(chuckling)

21:01.661 --> 21:02.629
(boy gasps)

21:02.662 --> 21:04.331
The card moved.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.333
Did anyone else see that?

21:06.366 --> 21:07.934
Holy... (school bell rings)

21:10.169 --> 21:12.772
**

21:12.805 --> 21:14.341
Hello, we're here
on set with Brian Nosek

21:14.374 --> 21:16.008
because I have way more
questions for him

21:16.042 --> 21:18.277
about the reproducibility
crisis in science.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.679
Thanks for having me.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.180
Is the crisis real
and is it something

21:21.213 --> 21:22.615
that we should all
be worried about?

21:22.649 --> 21:25.084
Well, it's at least
a crisis of confidence.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.521
And it's, uh, something that
emerged when researchers

21:28.555 --> 21:31.691
across a variety
of disciplines realized

21:31.724 --> 21:34.694
that the published literature,
what we thing we're doing

21:34.727 --> 21:38.264
and producing and finding isn't
as reliable as we think it is.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.666
And so, can you walk us
through a little bit

21:39.699 --> 21:42.635
of how the fields
realized this was happening.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.704
Well, the oddity is is that
we've known the challenges

21:44.737 --> 21:46.806
for reproducibility
for 60 years.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.208
And it hasn't
gotten a groundswell.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.310
But that has shifted
over the last ten years

21:51.344 --> 21:54.547
because perhaps the internet
helped make it easier

21:54.581 --> 21:57.350
to evaluate lots of different
papers at the same time.

21:57.384 --> 22:00.520
Perhaps because of a couple
of very dramatic findings

22:00.553 --> 22:02.054
that there has been
a convergence.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.823
And so it has become a thing.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.492
Now that we know about it,
we can do something about it.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.626
That's exactly right.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.194
Science is at its best

22:08.227 --> 22:10.162
when it is constantly
self critiquing

22:10.196 --> 22:11.964
of looking at where
it's limited,

22:11.998 --> 22:14.133
where it's not finding things
that are reliable

22:14.166 --> 22:15.568
and looking for ways
to do it better.

22:15.602 --> 22:19.406
Every scientific claim is wrong
in some fundamental way.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.908
And the process of discovery
in science is figuring out

22:21.941 --> 22:24.577
where our current models
of the world are wrong

22:24.611 --> 22:26.145
and how we can make
them less wrong.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.415
I'm so fascinated by that.
Can you elaborate on

22:28.448 --> 22:30.517
every scientific theory
about the world

22:30.550 --> 22:32.819
is wrong in some way.
In some way.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.554
If we had a perfect model
of the world,

22:34.587 --> 22:36.523
it would be as complex
as the world.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.858
How it is we describe
how the world works,

22:38.891 --> 22:40.927
how people interact,
how atoms interact,

22:40.960 --> 22:43.530
whatever it is,
is a simplification.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.498
It is a way to try
to describe...
Right.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.768
...lots of different things that
are happening in simple terms

22:48.801 --> 22:51.438
that make predictions about
next things that will happen.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.773
Right.
But our predictions
are always imperfect.

22:53.806 --> 22:56.743
They can't quite get exactly
the phenomena as we study them.

22:56.776 --> 22:57.944
So, they're wrong.
Right.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.279
But wrong doesn't mean,
oh, that's useless.

23:00.312 --> 23:01.681
It's not information
that we need.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.215
It's not information
that we can use.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.784
Newton's Laws of Mechanics

23:04.817 --> 23:07.520
are the most successful theory
ever, right?

23:07.554 --> 23:09.456
We use them to build bridges
and skyscrapers...

23:09.489 --> 23:11.123
I learned about them
in high school, yeah.

23:11.157 --> 23:12.592
And they're wrong, right?

23:12.625 --> 23:14.360
Einstein showed
how they are wrong

23:14.393 --> 23:16.295
when things are moving
very fast.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.565
So, it isn't that something
being wrong means,

23:18.598 --> 23:20.633
oh, can ignore science.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.869
It means there's always
something more to learn.

23:22.902 --> 23:26.305
So, that leads me really nicely
to my next question which is...

23:26.338 --> 23:28.240
Is this a reason
that people

23:28.274 --> 23:31.143
should stop believing
or trusting science?

23:31.177 --> 23:32.311
You know,
should the audience go home

23:32.344 --> 23:33.580
and every time they
read about a new study say,

23:33.613 --> 23:35.782
oh, that's probably
never gonna be reproduced

23:35.815 --> 23:38.050
and so I'm not even gonna
think about it again?

23:38.084 --> 23:41.988
One of the big challenges
of scientific knowledge

23:42.021 --> 23:44.090
is that is accumulates
very slowly.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.459
So, no one study
is definitive.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.727
Drinking coffee
is bad for you.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.261
No, drinking coffee
is good for you.

23:49.295 --> 23:50.296
No, drinking coffee's
bad for you.

23:50.329 --> 23:52.632
Well, make up your mind,
scientists.

23:52.665 --> 23:56.068
It's those claims that are
initially very exciting.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.505
But then survive confrontation
over time

23:58.538 --> 24:01.674
are the ones that survive
and we have confidence in.

24:01.708 --> 24:05.111
So, as a reader of the newspaper
of reporting scientific results,

24:05.144 --> 24:08.247
one thing to look for is,
is this the first finding?

24:08.280 --> 24:09.749
Is this something
brand-new?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.851
Uh, or is it the accumulation

24:11.884 --> 24:13.653
of a lot of different
pieces of evidence?

24:13.686 --> 24:17.524
That's a very easy signal for
whether that's a credible claim

24:17.557 --> 24:19.859
or a reliable claim
that we know a lot about it

24:19.892 --> 24:22.529
versus something new
and possibly exciting.
Yeah.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.531
The reason
to trust science

24:24.564 --> 24:26.633
is because
it doesn't trust itself.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.100
Ahh.
Right?

24:28.134 --> 24:31.704
It's that science is always
questioning its own findings

24:31.738 --> 24:35.274
which makes it the most reliable
way to discover things.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.676
Thank you so much
for being here.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.077
Thanks for having me, Adam.
