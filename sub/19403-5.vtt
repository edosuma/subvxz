00:56.114 --> 00:57.483
Fuck.

01:08.727 --> 01:11.497
This one's called
"A Good Night's Sleep."

01:57.576 --> 01:59.512
Now, my songs are a little, I guess,

01:59.578 --> 02:00.946
a little brighter.

02:01.013 --> 02:03.416
Not to say that they're more intelligent,

02:03.482 --> 02:06.318
but they... they let a
little light get in there.

02:06.385 --> 02:08.387
Cool.

02:08.454 --> 02:10.288
Yours don't really.

02:10.354 --> 02:11.690
Well...

02:11.757 --> 02:13.325
Let me ask you a question.

02:13.392 --> 02:14.993
Straight up.

02:15.060 --> 02:16.962
Cool.

02:17.029 --> 02:18.464
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

02:18.531 --> 02:19.698
Straight up.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.434
Cool.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.736
Do you like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?

02:23.802 --> 02:25.203
Yeah. I do.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.405
Me, too.

02:26.472 --> 02:27.472
I had one today.

02:27.506 --> 02:28.674
Me, too, see?

02:28.741 --> 02:30.108
- See what?
- They're a real treat

02:30.175 --> 02:32.845
because they combine two
things that are different,

02:32.911 --> 02:35.781
but together they're beautiful.

02:35.848 --> 02:37.315
So I'm saying...

02:37.382 --> 02:38.584
Yeah.

02:38.651 --> 02:42.287
So I'm saying do you want to jam?

02:44.523 --> 02:47.493
That verse isn't about being in love.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.595
It's about being so in it

02:49.662 --> 02:51.764
that you... you don't even
care that it's raining.

02:51.830 --> 02:54.933
You just want to feel good in the rain.

02:56.802 --> 02:59.472
Like singing in the rain?

03:00.439 --> 03:04.042
Shit.

03:04.109 --> 03:05.511
Yeah.

03:05.578 --> 03:07.713
Well, that's okay. I mean...

03:07.780 --> 03:10.348
You think that's a problem?

03:10.415 --> 03:12.384
I mean, is it a chorus,
singing in the rain?

03:12.451 --> 03:13.819
Because I would probably...

03:13.886 --> 03:18.023
No, no. This song has an original,

03:20.025 --> 03:21.760
it's...

03:21.827 --> 03:25.731
It gives a name to
pleasant mid-day wetness.

03:28.734 --> 03:30.368
What are you talking about?

03:30.435 --> 03:33.672
Morning dew, evening mist.

03:33.739 --> 03:37.843
What about 3 p.m.? 3:30?

03:37.910 --> 03:40.212
Wetness then.

03:40.278 --> 03:41.446
"Afternoon Spray."

03:41.514 --> 03:44.483
That's what I came up with.

03:44.550 --> 03:46.051
Want to try it again?

04:03.569 --> 04:05.270
What, did I get the chord wrong?

04:05.337 --> 04:07.640
No. Perfect on the chords. Perfect.

04:07.706 --> 04:12.244
Um, the... there's joy in this song. Joy.

04:12.310 --> 04:13.746
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:13.812 --> 04:17.015
I'm... I'm not really feeling your joy.

04:18.684 --> 04:21.687
I'm not really feeling joy.

04:21.754 --> 04:25.290
Well, what's getting you down?

04:25.357 --> 04:26.825
Like, I mean, let's tackle that.

04:26.892 --> 04:33.131
Just, you know, the stuff that...

04:34.266 --> 04:37.302
the normal stuff

04:37.369 --> 04:39.572
that gets to everybody.

04:39.638 --> 04:41.039
No special lady?

04:41.106 --> 04:43.208
Like, no one to share the special stuff?

04:43.275 --> 04:45.277
Because I don't... I
don't have that, either.

04:45.343 --> 04:48.614
I... I mean, I used to. I...

04:48.681 --> 04:51.116
I lost it. I... I want it back,

04:51.183 --> 04:52.517
but I can't.

04:52.585 --> 04:54.820
You know, but every morning I wake up.

04:54.887 --> 04:56.421
I have the same thought.

04:56.488 --> 04:57.790
It's been a long time

04:57.856 --> 05:00.559
since something special happened to me,

05:00.626 --> 05:03.261
and I'm so alone, but I'm blessed, really,

05:03.328 --> 05:04.730
because...

05:05.998 --> 05:09.301
if something nice
actually did happen to me,

05:09.367 --> 05:12.070
I wouldn't have anyone
nice to share it with, so...

05:13.906 --> 05:18.043
maybe, when something good happens,

05:18.110 --> 05:20.813
it'll be when I have someone nice.

05:20.879 --> 05:24.717
And then it'll be double great.

05:27.019 --> 05:28.654
I mean, I don't say that every morning.

05:28.721 --> 05:31.189
It... It's just too long,

05:31.256 --> 05:32.725
so I just say...

05:33.992 --> 05:35.694
double great.

05:35.761 --> 05:38.063
You want to say it with me?

05:38.130 --> 05:39.497
Double great?

05:39.564 --> 05:41.767
Yeah.

05:41.834 --> 05:43.301
No.

05:45.704 --> 05:47.105
That's cool.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.976
But why?

05:52.277 --> 05:53.646
Because I have somebody.

05:53.712 --> 05:56.148
- That's not the...
- Good.

05:58.050 --> 05:59.151
What, then?

06:01.787 --> 06:04.322
This is a general feeling,

06:04.389 --> 06:07.826
just a general thing.

06:07.893 --> 06:09.795
When I feel bad generally,

06:09.862 --> 06:12.665
I just do something
specifically that's fun.

06:13.666 --> 06:15.834
So we could do a thing.

06:15.901 --> 06:17.035
Let's do something,

06:17.102 --> 06:20.405
do a thing specifically that's fun.

06:20.472 --> 06:22.741
Like what?

06:22.808 --> 06:25.678
Like go get drunk,

06:25.744 --> 06:27.312
talk about music all night.

06:29.782 --> 06:33.018
He changed lines, man.
That's all I'm saying.

06:33.085 --> 06:34.653
- Who?
- Willie changed lines

06:34.720 --> 06:36.288
in "Pancho and Lefty."

06:36.354 --> 06:37.723
- All right.
- Greg12 thinks

06:37.790 --> 06:40.292
he made it better. I say leave it, man.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.828
It's all good. It's just...

06:42.895 --> 06:44.596
- It's just music.
- Hey!

06:44.663 --> 06:46.198
It's like mu...

06:49.467 --> 06:50.936
All right. It's okay.

06:51.003 --> 06:52.871
- It's okay.
- Don't worry about him, man.

06:52.938 --> 06:55.373
He's... He's a dick. What were we saying?

06:59.444 --> 07:01.814
Whoa. Now the vibe's gone.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.949
- Why?
- Because of this dick.

07:04.016 --> 07:05.918
No, don't say it out loud like that.

07:05.984 --> 07:07.452
- I don't like to fight.
- All right.

07:07.519 --> 07:08.954
- No need.
- All right.

07:09.021 --> 07:10.122
Hey, man.

07:13.258 --> 07:14.727
Do it again.

07:20.665 --> 07:22.868
1, 2, 3.

07:22.935 --> 07:24.302
"Seinfeld."

07:25.771 --> 07:27.706
Favorite character on "Seinfeld."

07:27.773 --> 07:29.207
1, 2, 3.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.308
Elaine.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.677
My God. My God.

08:40.544 --> 08:41.847
Rob.

08:44.249 --> 08:45.483
You still here?

08:47.585 --> 08:50.055
Yep.

08:51.056 --> 08:52.825
Right here, John.

08:55.861 --> 08:57.462
That was fun.

08:57.529 --> 08:58.964
Yeah.

08:59.932 --> 09:01.066
How many songs

09:01.133 --> 09:03.201
did we end up recording last night?

09:05.403 --> 09:06.604
Five.

09:11.476 --> 09:12.510
Well...

09:14.612 --> 09:16.248
I have to get up.

09:16.314 --> 09:19.351
I got a job as a night watchman.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.488
It's daytime.

09:23.555 --> 09:25.257
Yeah.

09:25.323 --> 09:27.692
Shit.

09:27.759 --> 09:29.962
I should get going.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.969
Double great.

09:38.403 --> 09:41.073
I think we should look wistfully

09:41.139 --> 09:42.640
back at the camera.

09:42.707 --> 09:43.808
Want to practice?

09:43.876 --> 09:45.053
You think we need to practice that?

09:45.077 --> 09:46.411
Yeah, I think we need to practice

09:46.478 --> 09:49.281
'cause it's our album cover.
We need to do it right.

09:49.347 --> 09:50.382
Okay.

09:50.448 --> 09:52.617
Okay, 1, 2, 3.

11:03.755 --> 11:05.257
Are you okay?

11:06.258 --> 11:07.892
Do you need help of some kind?

11:07.960 --> 11:10.362
I'm okay. Thank you.

11:10.428 --> 11:13.131
You should stay here for a while.

11:15.033 --> 11:16.634
No, I'm fine.

11:18.336 --> 11:21.106
Just long day.

11:37.689 --> 11:38.890
Reception.

11:38.957 --> 11:40.592
Housekeeping.

11:41.793 --> 11:42.827
Is this housekeeping?

11:42.894 --> 11:44.862
Yes. How may I help you?

11:44.929 --> 11:48.066
I'm in the Electress of Saxony Room.

11:50.435 --> 11:54.106
Let's not leave the room fridge open

11:54.172 --> 11:55.773
in the future here.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.675
I... I am sorry?

11:57.742 --> 11:59.744
My fridge.

11:59.811 --> 12:02.647
Let's get shipshape.

12:02.714 --> 12:06.284
Let's close the things that close, okay?

12:06.351 --> 12:08.553
Your fridge was left open?

12:08.620 --> 12:09.754
Yes.

12:09.821 --> 12:11.189
I'll make a note of it.

12:11.256 --> 12:12.724
I'd appreciate it.

12:15.493 --> 12:17.662
I look forward to better service.

12:19.097 --> 12:20.732
Have a good night.

12:20.798 --> 12:22.300
Good night, monsieur.

15:28.085 --> 15:29.954
Hey, John.

15:30.021 --> 15:31.989
Hey.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.591
John, why did you ask

15:33.658 --> 15:37.329
if my last name Icabod was a nickname?

15:37.395 --> 15:38.796
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did, John.

15:38.863 --> 15:41.165
You mentioned that. You said... I quote...

15:41.233 --> 15:43.868
"Hey, what's your last
name, Peter, anyway?"

15:43.935 --> 15:45.136
I said, "Icabod."

15:45.203 --> 15:48.873
You said, "I thought that was a nickname."

15:48.940 --> 15:50.475
Why did you think that?

15:50.542 --> 15:53.578
Just...

15:53.645 --> 15:55.213
no reason.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.448
Is it because I look

15:56.514 --> 15:59.917
like I live in an enchanted forest

15:59.984 --> 16:01.953
in a Grimm fairy tale

16:02.019 --> 16:05.823
wearing a cloak or some such?

16:07.725 --> 16:09.827
No.

16:09.894 --> 16:12.930
Or yeah, I guess, honestly, Peter,

16:12.997 --> 16:14.799
but not in a bad way.

16:20.137 --> 16:22.807
Nice work on the plate presentation.

16:22.874 --> 16:25.877
You locked that down. Didn't he, Leslie?

16:25.943 --> 16:29.714
- Didn't he what?
- Didn't Lakeman lock it down?

16:30.782 --> 16:31.816
Yeah.

16:31.883 --> 16:33.418
Lakeman locks it down.

16:33.485 --> 16:36.454
So, Icabod, I can work tonight, turns out.

16:36.521 --> 16:38.290
Thought you were otherwise engaged.

16:38.356 --> 16:40.157
Wanted to be. Last time, yeah,

16:40.224 --> 16:41.544
they sent these Japanese sisters,

16:41.593 --> 16:43.127
but they could only send one,

16:43.194 --> 16:44.296
which, yeah, for me

16:44.362 --> 16:46.264
doesn't get the job done.

16:46.331 --> 16:48.165
Leslie, hey, let's throw

16:48.232 --> 16:50.335
the euro conversion charting to John.

16:50.402 --> 16:52.169
Let's let John lead that tomorrow,

16:52.236 --> 16:53.371
I was thinking.

16:53.438 --> 16:54.798
But that's why we brought Stephen.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.541
That's his area of concentration.

16:56.608 --> 16:59.977
Yeah. Let's throw that to John.

17:00.044 --> 17:02.880
Lacking a little sex appeal here.

17:04.048 --> 17:05.416
Excuse me.

17:33.978 --> 17:36.013
Archduke Sebastian Room.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.383
Five minutes.

17:44.656 --> 17:46.324
Sorry.

17:47.759 --> 17:49.126
John.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.528
John.

17:50.595 --> 17:53.465
Ooh, I just want to hug you.

17:54.666 --> 17:56.934
But there's too many
big guys in here. Fuck.

17:57.001 --> 17:58.269
So what are you doing?

17:58.336 --> 17:59.771
Just...

17:59.837 --> 18:03.174
I mean in the suit and with these guys.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.643
Hi, guys. I'm... I'm Rob.

18:12.283 --> 18:14.018
Hey. Lawrence.

18:14.085 --> 18:16.388
Good. Rob.

18:20.692 --> 18:21.759
Rob.

18:21.826 --> 18:22.927
Leslie.

18:22.994 --> 18:24.996
Cool.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.198
- Eugene.
- Cool.

18:27.264 --> 18:28.966
Rob.

18:29.033 --> 18:30.468
You are?

18:31.403 --> 18:32.904
Abel.

18:32.970 --> 18:35.339
Hey. Cool. Rob.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.942
Montrose.

18:38.009 --> 18:38.810
Hey. Cool. Rob.

18:38.876 --> 18:40.445
Rob. Cool.

18:40.512 --> 18:41.979
Harrigen.

18:42.046 --> 18:43.114
Cool. Rob.

18:43.180 --> 18:44.749
Yeah. You?

18:44.816 --> 18:45.950
Plio.

18:46.017 --> 18:48.352
Plio. All right.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.788
All right. Cool. Rob.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.092
John, it's happening.

18:55.159 --> 18:56.694
What is?

18:56.761 --> 18:58.896
My life.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.398
Starting now.

19:03.234 --> 19:04.602
Let's catch up later.

19:04.669 --> 19:06.103
We'll catch up. Yeah, man.

19:06.170 --> 19:07.972
I got something I got to do now.

19:08.039 --> 19:09.039
W...

19:12.544 --> 19:16.013
Yeah. We got you, scumbag.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.482
You don't fucking take shit

19:17.549 --> 19:19.250
that doesn't fucking belong to you, bitch!

19:19.316 --> 19:21.052
Dennis, stop, man.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.118
Sorry.

19:25.757 --> 19:27.559
What are you going to do with him?

19:29.527 --> 19:31.128
Give them the money we brought over

19:31.195 --> 19:33.565
and give him back. Tell them to get lost.

19:33.631 --> 19:34.666
You got money over?

19:34.732 --> 19:36.333
We did.

19:36.400 --> 19:40.438
I barnstormed it through in my neck pillow.

19:40.505 --> 19:43.007
Yeah. It's not in there.

19:43.074 --> 19:47.144
I just wanted you to faint or something

19:47.211 --> 19:50.982
at TSA to cause a distraction
so I could get it across.

19:54.852 --> 19:56.153
Fuck.

19:56.220 --> 19:57.221
What?

19:57.288 --> 19:58.389
Really?

20:03.094 --> 20:05.196
Did you faint at TSA?

20:06.564 --> 20:08.132
Yeah, I did.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.104
Good job.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.170
Thanks.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.407
Hi, Stephen.

20:16.474 --> 20:18.409
Hi, John.

20:18.476 --> 20:20.144
My name's Ted.

20:20.211 --> 20:21.579
Sorry.

20:21.646 --> 20:23.047
You keep getting that wrong.

20:23.114 --> 20:24.381
Okay.

20:24.448 --> 20:26.417
- Hey.
- Yes?

20:26.484 --> 20:28.185
I heard you bragging to everyone

20:28.252 --> 20:30.154
how you can comb your own hair.

20:30.221 --> 20:31.455
I can.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.424
Really? Never seen it.

20:33.491 --> 20:36.193
I just heard you bragging to everyone.

20:36.260 --> 20:38.295
Well, I can.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.297
I don't believe you.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.899
I'd show you,

20:41.966 --> 20:45.036
but it's too early to remove my helmet.

20:45.102 --> 20:46.370
That's cool.

20:46.437 --> 20:47.805
I'll just tell everyone

20:47.872 --> 20:50.207
that you're a liar, then.

20:50.274 --> 20:52.376
How did you get in here, Ted?

20:52.443 --> 20:53.645
Don't worry about it.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.647
Why did you come in?

20:55.713 --> 20:57.224
Because everyone thinks you're a liar,

20:57.248 --> 20:59.951
and I wanted to tell you
that because I like you.

21:00.017 --> 21:03.888
I didn't believe them, but now I do

21:03.955 --> 21:06.223
because you won't comb your own hair.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.927
You smell familiar.

21:09.994 --> 21:12.229
You're probably lying about that.

21:15.533 --> 21:17.001
Watch this.

21:32.016 --> 21:33.818
You see, Ted?

21:42.226 --> 21:44.562
You enjoying Luxembourg?

21:46.831 --> 21:47.765
Yeah.

21:47.832 --> 21:50.301
For the most part, yeah. Thanks.

21:52.670 --> 21:54.238
It's good food.

22:05.249 --> 22:07.852
How am I going to talk to these guys?

22:10.087 --> 22:13.758
I speak Portuguese. I could translate.

22:13.825 --> 22:16.761
Brazil has the fourth largest
transport field in the world.

22:16.828 --> 22:18.930
It's my primary field. I could do it.

22:18.996 --> 22:20.497
I don't want them to see you.

22:20.564 --> 22:21.799
Either of you.

22:21.866 --> 22:23.234
We can do it from my room.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.703
Charles Ambrose. It's adjoining with yours.

22:27.104 --> 22:28.139
It is?

22:28.205 --> 22:30.241
Yeah. I requested it.

22:35.046 --> 22:37.181
The reason you're all still living...

22:39.350 --> 22:42.954
And the reason we're offering
any sum of money at all...

22:48.025 --> 22:50.227
We're sympathetic concerning your brother,

22:50.294 --> 22:51.528
but you stole from us,

22:51.595 --> 22:53.998
and this is all we'll do to conciliate.

23:00.905 --> 23:03.274
The bag you're looking for...

23:03.340 --> 23:04.776
I don't have it.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.243
I'm looking for it too.

23:06.310 --> 23:08.479
Take this money.

23:08.545 --> 23:09.613
Take your brother.

23:09.681 --> 23:12.249
Leave. Say nothing.

23:12.316 --> 23:14.251
Or I'll take you one by one,

23:14.318 --> 23:15.953
just like I took him.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.989
It's a good deal of money.

23:37.608 --> 23:39.376
Are you adding stuff?

23:39.443 --> 23:40.845
No.

23:40.912 --> 23:43.214
It sounds like you're adding stuff.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.982
Nope.

24:20.617 --> 24:22.219
John Tavner.

24:34.766 --> 24:35.699
Shit.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.001
What?

24:38.202 --> 24:39.370
This guy's coming,

24:39.436 --> 24:40.872
this guy named Leslie.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.539
I'm a known figure a little bit.

24:42.606 --> 24:43.875
We shouldn't be seen together.

24:43.941 --> 24:45.285
Yeah. We're pretty together here, too.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.812
Just you got to keep embracing me.

24:47.879 --> 24:50.181
I'm just gonna sort of...

24:50.247 --> 24:51.582
But then we're gonna be embracing

24:51.648 --> 24:52.817
for, like, three minutes.

24:52.884 --> 24:54.004
He already thinks I'm weird.

24:54.051 --> 24:55.352
What's the alternative?

24:55.419 --> 24:57.488
Yeah. Fuck.

25:26.183 --> 25:29.887
Alice was worried that
you weren't all right.

25:31.422 --> 25:32.990
She told me that.

25:34.491 --> 25:35.860
I'm all right.

25:37.728 --> 25:39.330
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:41.298 --> 25:43.400
You came all the way to Luxembourg

25:43.467 --> 25:45.402
to see if I'm all right?

25:45.469 --> 25:47.138
Yes.

25:52.776 --> 25:54.545
Okay, here's what we're going to do.

25:54.611 --> 25:56.647
First thing, you're gonna get some sleep.

25:56.713 --> 25:58.883
Then you're gonna eat.

25:58.950 --> 26:01.485
And then we're gonna have some fun.

26:02.887 --> 26:04.421
You pick the fun.

26:06.290 --> 26:07.524
Can I come?

26:09.660 --> 26:13.364
Well, it wouldn't be much
fun without you, Eddie.

26:13.430 --> 26:14.866
Can I come?

26:35.352 --> 26:37.488
To my left you will
see King Gerald's Tower,

26:37.554 --> 26:40.824
all that is left of
Luxembourg's first Castle Mount.

26:40.892 --> 26:42.994
It was the site of King Gerald's Fall.

26:43.060 --> 26:46.463
In 1563, King Gerald was
facing down a rebellion.

26:46.530 --> 26:50.067
His people were starving due
to a blighted apple harvest.

26:50.134 --> 26:51.668
They blamed the aging Gerald

26:51.735 --> 26:53.537
and believed their king had gone soft

26:53.604 --> 26:55.239
in his advanced years.

26:55.306 --> 26:56.740
I want to know what you're facing,

26:56.807 --> 26:58.509
all of it.

26:58.575 --> 27:01.012
I need to know you're okay.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.747
So don't hold back.

27:03.814 --> 27:05.917
Spill it, kid.

27:05.983 --> 27:08.485
The detective asked to interview me

27:08.552 --> 27:11.488
about the thing.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.892
The killing?

27:15.960 --> 27:17.561
The killing.

27:17.628 --> 27:20.064
Of a man who was trying
to choke you to death.

27:20.131 --> 27:22.466
Of a man who was trying to kill you.

27:22.533 --> 27:23.767
Yeah. The thing.

27:23.834 --> 27:25.002
She asked to interview me

27:25.069 --> 27:27.038
and a number of my colleagues.

27:27.104 --> 27:29.206
I can't account for my whereabouts

27:29.273 --> 27:30.874
at the time of the killing.

27:30.942 --> 27:34.278
In fact, I missed a meeting I had planned.

27:34.345 --> 27:37.214
She's interviewing him, this guy.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.116
If she covers that with him...

27:39.183 --> 27:40.784
What did you tell him?

27:40.851 --> 27:43.420
Your excuse for missing the meeting.

27:43.487 --> 27:46.257
They sent my bag to the wrong hotel.

27:47.824 --> 27:50.361
Got your little suit, guy?

27:50.427 --> 27:52.329
She'll blow that lie out in two seconds

27:52.396 --> 27:53.630
if she cares to.

27:55.032 --> 27:58.035
No courier was sent with my bag.

27:58.102 --> 28:00.404
No hotel received it.

28:00.471 --> 28:03.074
She could learn that, during
the time of the killing,

28:03.140 --> 28:06.577
nobody knows where I was. No one can say.

28:06.643 --> 28:09.580
She could learn all this at
these interviews tomorrow.

28:11.682 --> 28:12.950
We need to make an alibi.

28:13.017 --> 28:15.686
I'm working on it with Ed.

28:15.752 --> 28:18.555
She has...

28:18.622 --> 28:22.159
The detective has a photograph of me, too.

28:24.761 --> 28:27.598
Yeah, it's six hours later here.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.300
I know. Weird, right?

28:29.366 --> 28:33.470
You haven't been photographed
since you were 19 years old.

28:33.537 --> 28:34.705
I was.

28:35.906 --> 28:38.142
I did, yeah.

28:38.209 --> 28:41.178
Under what circumstances?

28:41.245 --> 28:43.380
For the cover of something

28:43.447 --> 28:45.516
I recorded with a friend of mine

28:45.582 --> 28:48.052
in April, after I...

28:49.386 --> 28:52.723
So she has this what, CD?

28:52.789 --> 28:54.858
A photo of me under another name.

28:54.925 --> 28:57.728
Yeah. She has it somewhere.

28:57.794 --> 28:59.363
She's going to interview me.

28:59.430 --> 29:01.365
Then if she looks at that thing...

29:02.599 --> 29:04.935
Why would you take that picture?

29:05.002 --> 29:07.338
This thing with the guy,

29:07.404 --> 29:10.241
it was making me, I don't know,

29:10.307 --> 29:11.775
happy.

29:11.842 --> 29:13.710
I didn't think.

29:13.777 --> 29:16.713
I was in the...

29:16.780 --> 29:18.715
afternoon spray, I guess.

29:18.782 --> 29:20.151
What? In the what?

29:20.217 --> 29:22.253
That's just when you're...

29:22.319 --> 29:23.654
you're feeling good...

29:25.389 --> 29:27.724
you don't really know what
else is going on around you

29:27.791 --> 29:28.791
so much.

29:29.993 --> 29:31.362
I'm sorry.

29:31.428 --> 29:33.764
Come on. You kidding me?

29:33.830 --> 29:35.532
Look at it from my end.

29:35.599 --> 29:38.202
I authorized the illegal
use of American money

29:38.269 --> 29:39.836
to influence a foreign election,

29:39.903 --> 29:41.381
then I gave the money to the bad guy,

29:41.405 --> 29:43.040
and he's going to use that money

29:43.107 --> 29:45.176
to put Iran back on the path to active...

29:45.242 --> 29:47.244
their weapons program.

29:47.311 --> 29:50.847
A monumental fuck-up that falls to me.

29:50.914 --> 29:55.219
That's... a bigger deal than a picture.

29:55.286 --> 29:58.021
And I wasn't in any
afternoon splash deal, either.

29:58.089 --> 29:59.790
I thought I was thinking clearly.

30:01.325 --> 30:03.094
Don't beat yourself up.

30:04.661 --> 30:06.963
It's still out there.

30:07.030 --> 30:09.133
The bag, the guy.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.567
Well, we need to find him.

30:10.634 --> 30:12.903
The physicist's wife flies in today.

30:12.969 --> 30:15.072
I found the bag man once.

30:15.139 --> 30:16.507
I don't know now.

30:16.573 --> 30:18.008
He won't go back to that room.

30:18.075 --> 30:19.776
He's here alone.

30:22.679 --> 30:24.115
Are you?

30:25.616 --> 30:27.184
You're supposed to be here alone,

30:27.251 --> 30:29.720
but are you actually alone?

30:30.787 --> 30:32.989
Yeah. We have recess, too.

30:33.056 --> 30:34.691
Yeah. It's awesome.

30:36.127 --> 30:38.562
So anyway, remember,

30:38.629 --> 30:40.964
you can't lose from the sidelines.

30:41.031 --> 30:43.800
Let's find his Edward.

30:43.867 --> 30:45.869
How?

30:45.936 --> 30:47.838
Let's use Edward.

30:49.206 --> 30:51.142
We find the guy, we get the bag back,

30:51.208 --> 30:52.743
and we get you out of Luxembourg

30:52.809 --> 30:55.579
before there's more trouble
with this investigation.

30:59.883 --> 31:01.318
We're trying to find this fellow.

31:01.385 --> 31:04.655
He plays your role.
Walk us through your day.

31:04.721 --> 31:08.259
How do you know
he'll have my, you know, vibe?

31:08.325 --> 31:10.594
Because his brother's like John.

31:10.661 --> 31:12.863
That's how families
turn out, it seems like.

31:12.929 --> 31:15.466
You get a John, you get an Edward.

31:15.532 --> 31:18.502
So how do you spend your day, son?

31:18.569 --> 31:21.205
- Well...
- Owning up here. Go.

31:21.272 --> 31:24.708
I sleep until 1 p.m., say.

31:24.775 --> 31:27.244
Then I put on something comfortable.

31:27.311 --> 31:28.912
Then I go to the hotel gym

31:28.979 --> 31:31.548
and see if there are any
attractive women in there

31:31.615 --> 31:33.584
under, say, 30.

31:33.650 --> 31:37.053
If there are, I fake stretch nearby.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.989
If not, I just leave.

31:39.055 --> 31:41.358
And do you always stay at the best hotel?

31:41.425 --> 31:43.694
It's taxpayer's money, so yes.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.896
Does this guy work for the government?

31:45.962 --> 31:47.097
Sort of.

31:47.164 --> 31:48.175
Then he'll be at the The King Gerald.

31:48.199 --> 31:49.966
I mean, where are you staying?

31:50.033 --> 31:51.502
The King Gerald.

31:51.568 --> 31:52.636
See?

32:02.679 --> 32:04.515
What's up, man?

32:04.581 --> 32:05.882
What's up?

32:05.949 --> 32:07.884
I like your style.

32:07.951 --> 32:10.187
Yeah, you, too.

32:10.254 --> 32:13.023
Like the whole thing, the whole vibe.

32:13.089 --> 32:17.194
Cool. Yeah, you, too, your vibe.

32:17.261 --> 32:18.595
Thanks, man.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.912
We have a record of Mahtma El-Mashad

32:35.979 --> 32:37.714
flying in, arriving at 1:30.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.883
My guess is they'll get
together straight away,

32:39.950 --> 32:41.218
her and the Bag Man.

32:41.285 --> 32:42.886
She has a ticket back the next morning.

32:42.953 --> 32:43.987
Where's she staying?

32:44.054 --> 32:45.289
The King Gerald.

32:45.356 --> 32:46.599
Edward's got a point about that.

32:46.623 --> 32:48.492
We all stay there... public servants,

32:48.559 --> 32:50.427
men of science, religious extremists.

32:50.494 --> 32:52.496
It's the best place.

33:00.837 --> 33:02.839
Mahtma El-Mashad.

33:02.906 --> 33:04.641
Welcome. Passport?

33:15.719 --> 33:18.589
You're in the Countess Hedwig.

33:18.655 --> 33:21.325
I would like to watch
a film this afternoon.

33:21.392 --> 33:23.627
Very good. You can do that from your room.

33:23.694 --> 33:26.096
I would like to watch a Disney film.

33:26.162 --> 33:28.732
I'm sure... I'm sure we have those.

33:28.799 --> 33:31.768
What are my Disney choices?

33:31.835 --> 33:33.804
Your Disney choices

33:33.870 --> 33:35.406
would be...

33:36.273 --> 33:39.843
Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3,

33:39.910 --> 33:44.147
Tangled, and Wreck-It Ralph.

33:44.214 --> 33:46.583
And what are they concerning?

33:46.650 --> 33:49.386
Well, Beverly Hills Chihuahua,

33:49.453 --> 33:51.822
that's probably about dogs.

33:51.888 --> 33:55.759
Tangled is about a young
woman on an adventure,

33:55.826 --> 33:58.161
it looks like from the trailer.

33:58.228 --> 34:02.333
And I don't know for the other one.

34:03.967 --> 34:06.269
I'll select Tangled.

34:08.539 --> 34:11.574
Can we arrange for an
employee to do that now

34:11.641 --> 34:14.445
before I arrive in the room?

34:14.511 --> 34:18.748
I would only like to see
that film on the television.

34:18.815 --> 34:20.684
Yes, we can.

34:28.224 --> 34:29.826
Who was your hallway pal?

34:29.893 --> 34:32.996
A stranger whose laptop I found in the bar

34:33.063 --> 34:34.731
and then I gave it back to him

34:34.797 --> 34:37.900
and then he was grateful.

34:37.967 --> 34:39.770
I'll say.

34:39.835 --> 34:42.438
My God.

34:43.607 --> 34:45.842
You know, I can't believe I found you.

34:48.779 --> 34:50.313
My God.

34:54.250 --> 34:57.921
I don't understand. You left Amsterdam.

35:01.024 --> 35:04.361
And you became a businessman in two months?

35:05.796 --> 35:07.998
And you have a different last name?

35:08.064 --> 35:10.734
Lakeman. Yeah.

35:12.369 --> 35:15.572
You marry a guy or something?

35:15.639 --> 35:16.773
Yeah.

35:17.941 --> 35:19.142
Cool.

35:19.209 --> 35:20.977
Yeah, I'm still single.

35:21.044 --> 35:23.179
Well, that's cool.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.181
Yeah.

35:25.248 --> 35:28.351
W-Well, not really, but...

35:28.419 --> 35:30.387
you know what is cool?

35:30.454 --> 35:32.155
Is we're getting medium play

35:32.222 --> 35:34.324
on three independent radio stations

35:34.391 --> 35:36.292
in central Europe.

35:36.359 --> 35:37.728
Cool.

35:37.794 --> 35:41.231
And we're playing the Tomorrowland Festival

35:41.297 --> 35:43.099
in Boom, Belgium.

35:43.166 --> 35:45.669
- When?
- Tonight.

35:45.736 --> 35:47.538
Rob, man...

35:47.604 --> 35:48.872
Hey, it's the folk tent.

35:48.939 --> 35:51.107
I know it's an EDM thing, really,

35:51.174 --> 35:53.009
but there's a folk tent,

35:53.076 --> 35:56.012
and one of the radio
stations, they have a bill.

35:56.079 --> 35:58.048
I called...

35:58.114 --> 36:00.751
and they said we could be on it.

36:00.817 --> 36:04.087
Tyhmens and Saperstein, man.

36:04.154 --> 36:05.756
We're on the bill.

36:05.822 --> 36:06.890
Rob...

36:06.957 --> 36:08.124
We're on the bill.

36:10.193 --> 36:11.895
It's cool, right, the name?

36:11.962 --> 36:14.130
Tomorrowland?

36:14.197 --> 36:17.768
So we go, and we hit it.

36:19.670 --> 36:22.005
Then tomorrow's different.

36:23.574 --> 36:25.108
Dennis, are you there?

36:26.242 --> 36:28.211
Always. I mean yeah.

36:28.278 --> 36:31.482
I'd like you to do
something tonight to help.

36:31.548 --> 36:33.249
Sure, man.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.418
I'm trying to find the
girl from the passport.

36:35.486 --> 36:36.653
I think she's an escort

36:36.720 --> 36:38.489
Lawrence hired on the first trip.

36:38.555 --> 36:40.724
I need you to gather some information...

36:40.791 --> 36:42.358
where she goes, where she lives.

36:42.425 --> 36:44.995
- Yeah.
- All right.

36:45.061 --> 36:47.864
So I'd like you to spend time tonight

36:47.931 --> 36:50.834
with some professional sex workers.

36:54.471 --> 36:55.606
Yes.

36:58.241 --> 36:59.610
Yep.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.513
Two tickets for 5 p.m.

37:02.579 --> 37:04.380
Is there beer on the boat?

37:04.447 --> 37:06.149
Yes, there is a bar, yes.

37:08.418 --> 37:09.953
Hey, man.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.222
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:13.724 --> 37:15.125
You'll like this boat, man.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.493
They got beer on the boat.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.137
All right. There's nothing like a cold one.

37:18.161 --> 37:19.963
There is nothing like a cold one, man.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.198
- That's pure science.
- Ha ha!

37:22.265 --> 37:24.167
Hey, man, I'm Kkyman.

37:24.234 --> 37:25.769
Rick.

37:25.836 --> 37:26.637
Cool.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.204
It is, actually.

37:28.271 --> 37:29.973
It's... It's Cool Rick.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.575
Of course it is.

37:35.712 --> 37:37.914
Ed found him.

37:37.981 --> 37:39.115
The Bag Man?

37:39.182 --> 37:42.252
We think we know where he'll be in an hour.

37:42.318 --> 37:43.754
The guy bought a ticket for two

37:43.820 --> 37:45.689
on that same thing we did today...

37:45.756 --> 37:47.290
the boat thing, tourist thing.

37:47.357 --> 37:48.825
The thing we did to...

37:48.892 --> 37:51.427
- So you could relax a little.
- Yeah.

37:51.494 --> 37:53.463
He's doing the same thing we did

37:53.530 --> 37:55.265
so I could relax a little.

37:55.331 --> 37:57.200
Good.

37:58.301 --> 37:59.970
Kill him.

38:03.339 --> 38:05.175
He doesn't have the bag.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.177
Who does?

38:07.243 --> 38:08.979
Um...

38:11.782 --> 38:13.617
I think she does.

38:17.153 --> 38:19.055
I think the bag got away.

38:19.122 --> 38:22.192
How? He had one transfer, A to B.

38:24.828 --> 38:27.598
I've been told that before,

38:27.664 --> 38:29.265
on occasion.

38:29.332 --> 38:32.703
El-Mashad's wife was
supposed to take it today.

38:32.769 --> 38:34.938
She's watching Tangled in her room.

38:36.807 --> 38:39.275
His brother's here, same as me.

38:41.144 --> 38:42.378
Why is Ed here?

38:42.445 --> 38:44.447
Because things got fucked up.

38:44.514 --> 38:47.317
Right. And the Bag Man's on a boat today,

38:47.383 --> 38:48.652
same as me.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.589
Why'd you take me today?

38:52.656 --> 38:54.090
The boat?

38:54.157 --> 38:57.160
Because things were getting fucked.

38:57.227 --> 38:59.195
You needed to catch your breath

38:59.262 --> 39:01.698
so you could find the bag.

39:01.765 --> 39:03.967
Yeah, well, he's doing the same thing,

39:04.034 --> 39:06.402
and I think for the same reasons.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.805
The bag got away from him.

39:11.374 --> 39:12.575
It's got something to do

39:12.643 --> 39:15.311
with the guy that runs McMillan somehow.

39:15.378 --> 39:18.048
McMillan's involved?

39:18.114 --> 39:19.249
Sort of, yeah.

39:19.315 --> 39:20.516
It's kind of last minute,

39:20.583 --> 39:23.286
- _
- but do you have any Japanese girls?

39:23.353 --> 39:27.057
Great. Just maybe to
accompany me to dinner.

39:27.123 --> 39:30.661
Or maybe to whip the back
of my legs with a Twizzler.

39:33.697 --> 39:35.331
Thank you, Maurice.

39:35.398 --> 39:37.267
I'm... I'm so sorry.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.601
He's a new guy.

39:38.669 --> 39:42.205
The Bag Man's on a boat.

39:42.272 --> 39:44.340
El-Mashad's watching movies.

39:44.407 --> 39:47.277
The guy doesn't have the bag.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.379
She does somehow.

39:49.445 --> 39:53.650
Yeah. Well, he's still
here, and you're still here,

39:53.717 --> 39:55.027
and he's still looking for the bag,

39:55.051 --> 39:56.753
and you're still looking for the bag.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.890
Go kill him.

40:16.372 --> 40:17.407
John?

40:19.542 --> 40:21.945
I think I'm seeing things, Dad.

40:24.514 --> 40:26.683
I think I started seeing things.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.651
Like what?

40:28.719 --> 40:33.924
Like a hundred people
hopping through town here.

43:10.580 --> 43:12.448
At that very tower window...

43:12.515 --> 43:14.150
They have beer.

43:14.217 --> 43:16.752
There's a little bar inside.

43:16.819 --> 43:19.555
Want me to get you a beer?

43:19.622 --> 43:21.391
One beer.

43:21.457 --> 43:22.825
Thanks.

43:22.893 --> 43:26.129
Hey, it's going to be all right.

43:26.196 --> 43:27.763
I'm here.

43:27.830 --> 43:29.699
It's going to be okay, man.

43:42.913 --> 43:45.248
Now please
join me below at the bar

43:45.315 --> 43:47.283
for the rest of the tour.

45:27.450 --> 45:30.520
"Amsterdam Time
Out" called their music

45:30.586 --> 45:34.690
an earnest and effortless
blending of two voices

45:34.757 --> 45:36.359
that form one sound.

45:36.426 --> 45:39.462
Tyhmens and Saperstein.

45:39.529 --> 45:41.697
I'm Tyhmens and Saperstein,

45:41.764 --> 45:43.433
and, I'm going to start

45:43.499 --> 45:46.269
with something from "Circles of Resonance."

45:46.336 --> 45:48.538
It's called "Superself."

45:56.212 --> 45:59.882
And you should imagine that
there's another, higher voice

45:59.949 --> 46:03.219
coming in at... at that
time... at the same time.

46:10.560 --> 46:14.330
And then, at the same time,
I'm saying "It split all..."

46:14.397 --> 46:16.832
Wow. Excuse...

46:16.899 --> 46:18.568
I love you, John!

46:18.634 --> 46:20.503
Wow, man!

46:20.570 --> 46:22.738
I'm glad you made it.

46:22.805 --> 46:24.374
Thank God.

46:24.440 --> 46:27.443
We should hit them with,
"Afternoon Spray."

46:27.510 --> 46:28.644
All right?

46:28.711 --> 46:31.013
I... I was, like, lost.

46:31.081 --> 46:32.515
- Yeah.
- Okay?

46:32.582 --> 46:34.050
"Afternoon Spray."

46:36.819 --> 46:38.588
Okay.

46:38.654 --> 46:40.290
Here we go.

47:34.877 --> 47:36.612
We love you, Rob!

48:42.312 --> 48:46.048
I'm sorry, Rob. I just,
couldn't recall the lyrics.

48:46.115 --> 48:51.521
Just... any of them...

48:51.587 --> 48:54.357
I think I'll just leave.

48:56.259 --> 48:59.061
Just... couldn't...

48:59.128 --> 49:00.930
couldn't recall any of them.
