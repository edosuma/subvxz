01:23.500 --> 01:24.751
<i>What is a monster?</i>

01:25.251 --> 01:27.712
<i>The man who threatens to kidnap you,</i>

01:27.796 --> 01:31.174
<i>forces you to fight for your life,</i>
<i>and ends up losing his?</i>

01:33.635 --> 01:37.097
<i>The bigoted neighbor</i>
<i>who's so sure she's on the side of right,</i>

01:37.180 --> 01:40.183
<i>she defaced your property</i>
<i>to prove your beliefs are wrong?</i>

01:45.271 --> 01:49.442
<i>Or is a monster anyone oranything</i>
<i>youfear will harm you,</i>

01:50.777 --> 01:52.987
<i>andthereforeyoumustharmitfirst?</i>

01:54.155 --> 01:56.491
<i>Keeping the victory to yourself,</i>
<i>of course,</i>

01:57.117 --> 01:59.202
<i>so that you can live tofightanother day.</i>

02:09.963 --> 02:12.382
Are you aware that a body was found
near Triplet Park?

02:13.424 --> 02:15.969
Am I aware?
It's all anyone's talking about.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.137
Are you not on TikTok?

02:17.220 --> 02:20.849
There's an entire hashtag,
"tripletmassacre," which, come on,

02:20.932 --> 02:23.017
one body does not a massacre make.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.605
A few nights ago, police broke up a party
at the same location.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.399
See anything suspicious?

02:30.066 --> 02:33.820
Noah and I were uber focused
on each other.

02:34.863 --> 02:41.870
Um, but, yes, now that I think of it,
a few people were acting sus.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.957
It was a gathering. A meetup with friends.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.168
And why, exactly, were you there?

02:48.251 --> 02:49.419
For the beer?

02:51.212 --> 02:54.132
Shit. Um, do I need a lawyer now?

02:54.799 --> 02:56.009
It wasn't my idea.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.011
We found them.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.763
-They suggested the bonfire.
-Tell me their names again.

03:00.847 --> 03:04.392
Noah Harrington and Phillipa Calhoun.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.228
It's Lancaster's cute, little "it couple."

03:08.771 --> 03:12.108
-And what time did you leave the party?
-I'm sorry, am I being questioned?

03:12.859 --> 03:15.653
-We're having a chat.
-It was Juliette Fairmont.

03:15.737 --> 03:20.116
She was hooking up with the new girl.
I went to take a piss and I saw that.

03:20.909 --> 03:25.038
Wait, don't write that.
Uh, makes me sound like a creeper.

03:25.580 --> 03:29.751
I'm an All-League, All-State basketball
and track star who holds the school record

03:29.834 --> 03:32.045
for the 100 and the 200.

03:32.128 --> 03:37.133
Hooking up is not an issue for me,
but I don't kiss and tell.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.052
It's tacky.

03:39.135 --> 03:43.473
Where I come from, police can't question
a minor without an adult present.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.768
But maybe the laws are different
in Savannah.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.856
I've got an AP English exam I'm late for.

03:51.940 --> 03:52.774
Of course.

03:52.857 --> 03:56.361
So you know, I don't think you had
anything to do with the body we found.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.530
The victim was exsanguinated.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.158
-That means the body--
-Was completely drained of blood.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.118
I know what exsanguinated means.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.870
You know he was killed by a vampire.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.706
Or someone suffering
from Clinical Vampirism.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.963
-An obsession with drinking blood.
-Good luck on your exam.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.719
-You saying I can't take my own kid?
-You can.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.346
All you'd have to do is sign here.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.808
-I ain't signing nothing.
-Seriously, Dad? What the hell!

04:26.891 --> 04:29.936
Get your things, pipsy, I'm taking you out
of this school for good!

04:30.770 --> 04:32.563
They can't keep our kids safe.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.440
The M.A.A.M.'s can!

04:35.149 --> 04:37.944
We're taking back our schools
and we're taking back our city.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.029
The police won't do it? We will!

04:40.113 --> 04:43.199
<i>No more vamps, no more ghouls.</i>

04:43.283 --> 04:46.244
<i>No more monsters</i>
<i>in our schools!</i>

04:46.327 --> 04:49.247
<i>No more vamps, no more ghouls,</i>

04:49.330 --> 04:52.292
<i>-no more monsters in our schools.</i>
-How many of those have you had?

04:52.375 --> 04:53.876
You look a little sweaty.

04:54.419 --> 04:58.256
Oh. I'm sorry, you did not get
Olivia Benson-ed for the last hour.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.425
Y'all follow me on Facebook.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.218
We're just getting started.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.724
-Okay, you need to talk to Bunny.
-I thought it was a phase.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.392
She's making things dangerous.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.310
Ben?

05:10.935 --> 05:12.854
Ben! Ben!

05:14.439 --> 05:16.566
Yes, yeah, I'll talk to her.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.986
Because I'm an amazing ally
and I love you.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.280
I love you too.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.331
Is it just me
or is Mr. Myer extra annoying

05:31.414 --> 05:34.500
for assigning group projects?
I mean, read the room.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.754
That detective told me
they're looking for a vampire.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.594
-What are you doing?
-Calling my dad.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.888
I don't think
the cops are worried about justice.

05:46.971 --> 05:51.059
Not with "Mothers Against All Monsters"
calling for heads to roll.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.102
If they find out I killed Cook...

05:53.186 --> 05:55.855
Come home with me.
My parents will know how to protect you.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.989
You want me to show up
to the Hunter family dinner,

06:05.073 --> 06:08.659
tell them I'm wanted by the police, and,
"Oh, can you please pass the salad?"

06:08.743 --> 06:10.912
First of all, there's no salad.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.247
My dad's cooking,
not a single green on the table.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.124
Okay, this is a fantasy, Cal.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.753
-We don't have that kind of relationship.
-Hey, listen to me.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.464
I'm not doing any more severings.

06:22.173 --> 06:25.343
Who cares if they think it worked?
We're together.

06:26.844 --> 06:29.138
Do you honestly think
they're going to accept that?

06:30.098 --> 06:30.932
To accept me?

06:32.392 --> 06:33.726
It's time to find out.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.198
Oh, you back to trying
to create your own comic?

06:47.281 --> 06:49.909
"Theo Man." Wasn't that it, Theo Man?

06:50.493 --> 06:51.494
One, I was 12.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.705
And two, I came down here
for some alone time, so...

06:55.456 --> 06:58.584
Okay, somebody didn't have
their protein shake today.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.548
What the hell?

07:04.924 --> 07:05.758
Sit down.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.468
And shut up.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.184
I thought only Mom and Dad
could open that door.

07:15.643 --> 07:19.063
I really just need you
to ride with me, okay?

07:27.613 --> 07:30.158
Paolo, my friend.
Everything all right?

07:30.908 --> 07:33.369
When there is no darkness,
everything is all right.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.497
I'm sorry, I hate to bust up the reunion.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.750
When did you learn Spanish,
and who the hell is this?

07:40.376 --> 07:42.211
Paolo,
with the Guild Archives.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.214
He's here to help me
with research on Legacies.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.177
Research? Okay.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.805
What's with the cases?

07:53.890 --> 07:55.349
They're Faraday cases.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.936
They block wireless transmissions
and keep the devices from being tracked.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.565
Since you're here, you might as well help.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.755
Where have you been?

08:26.714 --> 08:27.798
School.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.801
-I thought you were done.
-Get your room packed?

08:31.844 --> 08:35.973
Not yet, but, uh,
there's something I need to tell you.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.645
I need you to be cool. All right?

08:40.728 --> 08:41.771
Cal, what is it?

08:43.356 --> 08:44.732
I brought someone home.

08:49.779 --> 08:53.574
-Oh, hell, no.
-Stop. I told her she'd be safe here!

08:55.034 --> 08:56.035
Well, you lied.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.745
Cal, get out the way.

09:06.420 --> 09:10.883
Mom, she's in trouble,
she needs our help, okay?

09:21.477 --> 09:25.648
Girl, I forbid you from entering
this home, you understand?

09:26.649 --> 09:29.944
Dad... it's too late for that.

09:31.112 --> 09:35.283
-Late? Like, don't-- She's saying that...
-She's been here before.

09:37.201 --> 09:41.289
Obviously... this is a lot
for you to process.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.501
I'll give you a chance to let it settle.

09:48.129 --> 09:51.090
Whenever you're ready to talk,
we'll be in my room.

09:59.807 --> 10:03.436
-Okay. Okay. I'm gonna kill her.
-Oh, my...

10:04.020 --> 10:06.856
-We don't know how, remember?
-I meant Cal.

10:07.815 --> 10:12.570
Coming in my house, talking about this
vampire's been here before. When? Why?

10:13.237 --> 10:15.323
Telling me to calm down, I am calm.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.742
She didn't actually say, "Calm down."

10:18.326 --> 10:22.246
She did say that the girl was in trouble.
We could use that, right?

10:22.330 --> 10:25.166
So let's think about this carefully.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.095
Well, you're still alive.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.015
It's only been two minutes.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.146
Calliope Antigone Burns,
you have crossed my absolute limit.

10:47.229 --> 10:51.776
Closing a door when a girl's in your room?
It's not how it works in my house.

10:52.860 --> 10:56.364
The cops think
a vampire killed that man they found.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.783
-And you know something about that.
-Yes, sir.

11:02.036 --> 11:02.870
The body...

11:05.039 --> 11:06.332
It's Clayton Cook.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.210
Oh, my God.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.546
And how could you possibly know that, Cal?

11:14.173 --> 11:15.007
Because...

11:17.051 --> 11:17.885
I...

11:18.928 --> 11:19.762
I killed him.

11:20.888 --> 11:21.972
Of course you did.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.685
Cal, you get away from that monster.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.728
No, she killed him to protect me.

11:30.022 --> 11:33.317
I wouldn't be here
if Juliette hadn't stopped him.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.737
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did he hurt you?

11:37.321 --> 11:38.948
-Touch you in any way--
-No.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.661
He threatened
to take me to The Guild. So I ran.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.247
He caught me.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.292
I tried to fight him,
but he got the upper hand.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.381
All of my training went out the window.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.135
I know how to fight monsters
but not how to fight my own.

11:59.218 --> 12:02.221
He never should have laid
a hand on you and you know that.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.433
None of this is your fault, you hear me?

12:08.978 --> 12:12.189
If he wasn't dead,
I'd kill the son of a bitch myself.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.068
I owe Juliette my life.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.074
We're not gonna let
the police come for her.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.451
Please help us?

12:23.534 --> 12:27.747
Baby, now I'm grateful as hell
that you're okay, but we can't do that.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.249
We don't help vampires, ever.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.548
However, we don't want
to make her situation worse.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.594
The police won't learn
who or what she is from us.

12:46.056 --> 12:46.891
Ten minutes.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.602
Say your goodbyes.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.314
Then you have to leave, Juliette.

13:13.209 --> 13:17.463
Cal, sometimes I think that I'm in deeper
in this than you are, but...

13:19.840 --> 13:23.511
-I don't feel like that right now.
-What are you talking about?

13:25.179 --> 13:30.559
I can't eat, sleep or think straight,
unless we're together.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.965
-Wanna give it a try?

14:01.549 --> 14:03.676
Mom, what are you doing?

14:04.510 --> 14:07.304
I'm making stakes.
The stabbier the better.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.890
I meant, what are you doing for self-care?

14:09.974 --> 14:13.352
You time? This M.A.A.M. thing
doesn't seem very healthy.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.480
Protecting my family
sure feels healthy to me.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.607
You weren't here the last time
they took over.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.860
Schools, churches, everything was closed.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.529
We lived behind locked doors,
because if we went out,

14:23.612 --> 14:26.156
we could get taken right off the streets.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.534
Brutalized, eaten alive.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.786
Not every monster is a murderous menace.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.539
Some are mild-mannered,
productive members of society

14:33.622 --> 14:35.541
-who maybe drink a little blood.
-Oh.

14:38.335 --> 14:43.090
I am proud that I have raised
a sweet, considerate, accepting boy.

14:43.757 --> 14:46.135
But like I said, you weren't there.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.056
What if I was a monster?

14:52.600 --> 14:56.770
-Would you sic your M.A.A.M. folk on me?
-No, Ben, of course not.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.397
I'd take you out myself.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.482
You understand?

15:02.526 --> 15:04.528
-Mm-hm.

15:05.613 --> 15:09.450
A shelter-in-place order.
Advising to stay calm and stay home.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.202
Like a sitting duck?
The hell I will.

15:12.786 --> 15:15.039
I bet this is Fairmont's idea.

15:15.122 --> 15:18.125
Well, I will show him
what he can do with his order.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.214
Clearly, the severing didn't work.

15:24.298 --> 15:27.509
And it didn't work because Cal is
with her of her own free will.

15:27.593 --> 15:31.639
That's why I wanted her out.
And I wanted her out immediately.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.934
For a girl whose had
a lifetime of, "Yes, baby girl,"

15:35.017 --> 15:39.104
"Anything you want, baby girl,"
from her girl dad of a father,

15:39.188 --> 15:42.650
heh, of course she's gonna take
as long as she wants.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.614
-You expecting someone?
-No, but I'll get it.

15:48.697 --> 15:49.782
I'll check on Cal.

16:06.674 --> 16:07.883
You brought friends.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.678
We know Clayton Cook was killed
by a vampire.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.683
-Why are you bringing silver to my house?
-Because we know it was Cal's vampire.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.940
-What is that?
-I don't know.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.067
We got to get out of here.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.361
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:28.696 --> 16:33.909
First, Cal doesn't have a vampire,
so you won't find one here.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.328
Wherever Cal goes, the Legacy follows.

16:38.122 --> 16:42.251
We're friends, Jack, but you're making it
really hard to support you.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.378
My word should be enough.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.047
Please.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.676
Let us look around.

16:51.385 --> 16:55.055
You have nothing to lose
but the Guild's trust if you don't.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.786
Not exactly ride or die, Jo.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.331
Cops only confirmed
that Cook's body was drained.

17:21.415 --> 17:25.377
Kind of a big leap to accuse us
of harboring a vampire.

17:26.211 --> 17:31.925
So don't state your theory, your hunch,
as fact, then watch my pupils.

17:34.803 --> 17:37.890
We were trained
by the same Guild, remember?

17:58.786 --> 17:59.787
Where's Cal?

18:00.954 --> 18:02.956
Why don't you tell me, JoJo?

18:03.040 --> 18:05.751
You're the one keeping close tabs
on my family.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.381
<i>Good evening.</i>

18:12.800 --> 18:18.305
<i>I'm Arch McQueen,</i>
<i>and this pile of dust was a vampire,</i>

18:18.388 --> 18:20.432
<i>which I summarily dispatched.</i>

18:21.391 --> 18:22.476
<i>How did I do it?</i>

18:28.065 --> 18:31.527
<i>I call this bad girl Saturday Night Fever.</i>

18:34.196 --> 18:35.197
<i>Mmm.</i>

18:35.989 --> 18:38.075
This dipshit is so full of himself.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.579
Glad we don't have anyone like that
in our family.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.750
I'm confident in my abilities
with evidence I should be. Big difference.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.379
What was that?

18:52.005 --> 18:52.840
Theo?

18:53.841 --> 18:56.176
I asked a question, what was that look?

18:56.260 --> 18:58.262
You just need to focus, Apollo.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.060
-You all right?
-I will be,

19:05.894 --> 19:08.063
once I figure out
which Legacy killed my mother.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.403
Whoa! You almost left
the transmission back there.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.573
Apollo would kill me
if he knew I stole his car.

19:18.657 --> 19:22.286
-I thought we were borrowing it.
-We can't go back to my house.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.454
The city's crawling
with vigilante housewives,

19:24.538 --> 19:28.375
and no offense,
but your house is full of monsters.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.295
So the only plan I've got is
to drive to get out of town.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.673
And go where?

19:35.299 --> 19:37.676
I think we need help figuring that out.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.191
My favorite sister.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.194
You finally ready
to leave that bullshit life?

19:55.736 --> 19:56.737
Not exactly.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.451
I'm not even sure I want to be human.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.913
-I wouldn't be any better off.
<i>-You wouldn't.</i>

20:05.996 --> 20:10.000
Look, I'm not trying to be an asshole,
Jules, but I hate lies.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.084
I hate liars.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.795
Humans are like mades,

20:14.796 --> 20:17.174
but only on this Earth
because it's their time to be.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.676
Oliver, Cal and I need somewhere to hide.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.679
And, no,
I'm still not helping you hurt Elinor.

20:24.181 --> 20:28.227
But you're my brother
and I need your help.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.394
<i>Come on over.</i>

20:29.478 --> 20:32.314
I'm here whenever you need me.
I told you that.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.444
Juliette's coming around?

20:37.527 --> 20:39.738
My little sister's finally
seeing the light.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.012
<i>I snatched this off the hand of a Legacy.</i>

21:04.096 --> 21:05.347
Theo, check this out.

21:05.430 --> 21:11.478
<i>The symbol is unique to each bloodline.</i>
<i>Like a dazzling, deadly calling card.</i>

21:12.145 --> 21:13.522
More like an ugly ring.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.066
If I figure out which bloodline
that symbol belongs to,

21:16.149 --> 21:18.110
I can find the Legacy
that killed my mother.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.573
Theo, Apollo.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.534
Hey, JoJo, what's up?

21:25.617 --> 21:27.869
She's looking for vampires.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.748
But suddenly, I'm much more interested
in what's going on here.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.293
Faraday cases?

21:35.419 --> 21:39.256
And I assume you're hiding
in plain sight, Mr. Villanueva.

21:44.344 --> 21:47.055
How long have you
and your husband been in the Guild?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.807
-I'll take that.
-Let me answer that.

21:48.890 --> 21:52.311
Too long for you and your boys
to be up to unsanctioned bullshit.

22:01.528 --> 22:04.740
You like to tell me why your sons
are hacking into the Guild Library?

22:04.823 --> 22:06.950
-We weren't.
-You're stressing out

22:07.034 --> 22:09.995
our whole family with your paranoid,
finger-pointing show.

22:13.415 --> 22:19.046
You have five minutes to get the hacker
out of your house before I report you.

22:45.989 --> 22:48.784
You have no idea what you've done.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.577
Okay, left at the next light.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.955
Sure this is a good idea?

22:54.748 --> 22:59.378
Only met your brother once,
but he gave off serious unstable vibes.

22:59.461 --> 23:03.090
Yeah, he's a little nutty,
but he's been through a lot.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.551
-I don't really even know the whole story.

23:09.012 --> 23:09.846
What is that?

23:10.639 --> 23:12.057
No, no, no.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.683
Okay, chill.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.321
There's a shelter-in-place in order.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.282
-Your dad know you're out here?
-Cal's just taking me home.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.034
Good, you'll be safer there.

23:32.119 --> 23:32.953
Hold up.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.373
We got to test everyone.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.459
Real silver. Cool.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.092
Can never be too careful, right?

23:57.060 --> 23:58.562
-Hey!

23:59.354 --> 24:00.188
Watch it.

24:02.399 --> 24:06.278
Sorry, this is my brother's car.
I'm learning how to drive stick.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.661
But we better get going.

24:15.745 --> 24:18.915
Where do you got to get going to?
What are you hiding?

24:21.835 --> 24:24.588
That she's a monster.

24:26.256 --> 24:30.302
I'm taking her to meet my family.
I want to see their shocked faces.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.220
That's funny.

24:33.221 --> 24:36.850
A joke only the DA's daughter can make
while the town's got a real threat.

24:36.933 --> 24:39.936
Yeah, we're all jokesters,
the whole family.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.357
Why don't I escort you home?
Tell your dad how you kept me in stitches?

24:44.441 --> 24:46.693
-You don't have to do that.
-Sure I do.

24:55.327 --> 24:59.080
I need to know since when
we started lying to each other.

24:59.164 --> 25:02.125
Mom, please do not put me
in the middle of this.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.254
Fine. Here's your brother.

25:10.258 --> 25:12.469
You breached the security door, Theo?

25:14.221 --> 25:15.597
I'm not even sure what to say.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.308
We can get through anything.

25:20.393 --> 25:21.394
Anything...

25:23.563 --> 25:26.066
as long as we don't lie to each other.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.778
Since the day you were born,
I told you that--

25:29.861 --> 25:32.030
-You weren't there the day I was born.
-Theo.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.114
She wasn't.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.575
I am in this by myself.

25:35.659 --> 25:39.871
I still don't know what killed my mother,
and nobody in this house cares to know.

25:39.955 --> 25:40.914
I misspoke.

25:40.997 --> 25:43.542
-She didn't mean it and you know it.
-No, it's okay.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.503
Your brother has to deal with this
the way he needs to.

25:47.462 --> 25:50.840
Can you just leave me alone?

25:53.218 --> 25:54.427
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

25:56.638 --> 25:57.472
Okay.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.517
I can do that.

26:01.851 --> 26:02.852
Come here.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.771
I can do that. Here.

26:10.610 --> 26:11.444
Now...

26:13.154 --> 26:15.115
I don't mean to be insensitive...

26:16.992 --> 26:20.412
but what you did today,
it doesn't just go away.

26:31.631 --> 26:32.632
Come on, Apollo.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.322
I didn't know you were feeling this way.

26:57.198 --> 26:59.743
Or that you didn't think
you could talk to me about it.

27:06.124 --> 27:09.502
After the severing,
I started having visions of my mother.

27:14.007 --> 27:18.261
So I started searching the archives
and I still don't know.

27:22.682 --> 27:27.187
We're gonna find whatever did this
to your mother and destroy it.

27:39.407 --> 27:40.575
I got you, bro.

27:41.868 --> 27:44.037
I think I know someone
who can tell us about this symbol.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.170
Officer Garvey.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.631
Making sure these two got
where they're going.

27:54.714 --> 27:57.550
-Thanks, I was getting worried.
-Figured as much.

27:58.635 --> 28:01.304
You two, stay inside, stay safe.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.235
I think I found our monster.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.750
Elinor Fairmont.

28:31.584 --> 28:32.961
Yo, it was complicated.

28:33.712 --> 28:37.340
-We got a vibe going.
-She won't give up information to us.

28:37.424 --> 28:39.968
With that attitude,
all you'll get in that bar is a beer.

28:40.051 --> 28:43.847
I'm supposed to trust the plan of the dude
who brought a Summoner into the house?

28:45.557 --> 28:48.685
One day, you'll let that go,
see who I'm trying to be,

28:48.768 --> 28:50.895
instead of focusing on the mistake I made.

28:51.730 --> 28:52.939
All right, let's go.

28:54.065 --> 28:57.193
But she gives us a name,
or she gets a stake in her heart.

28:57.777 --> 28:59.988
It might not kill her,
but I'll enjoy watching the pain.

29:00.071 --> 29:03.199
I'm gonna make an executive decision.
You stay here, I'll go in.

29:03.283 --> 29:06.828
-No. No way, no.
-You don't know Elinor like I do.

29:06.911 --> 29:12.417
She's complicated, smart, sexy.
We're actually a lot alike.

29:14.627 --> 29:15.670
Here we go.

29:15.754 --> 29:19.215
Look, all I'm saying is, I get her.

29:19.299 --> 29:22.677
And if you trust me,
I mean, really trust me,

29:23.470 --> 29:25.972
let me do my thing. I'll get what we want.

29:30.643 --> 29:31.478
All right.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.078
I don't want to be here any more
than you want me here.

29:49.704 --> 29:52.957
Juliette, what possessed you
to bring her into our home?

29:53.750 --> 29:56.961
We'll go, as soon
as the overly helpful officer leaves.

29:57.045 --> 30:00.799
You are staying home.
The police force is combing the streets.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.301
They know that a vampire killed that guy.

30:03.384 --> 30:06.387
We don't bury bodies.
We're smarter than that.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.098
It wasn't Cal's idea.

30:10.016 --> 30:15.146
Please, don't tell me that
that ridiculously asinine idea was yours.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.482
-It was.
-Well, it's dumb.

30:17.565 --> 30:18.942
-Margot...
-What?

30:19.025 --> 30:22.737
-Wow, you're awful.

30:23.613 --> 30:24.697
Whoa.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.076
Looks like I'm in time for déjà vu.

30:28.785 --> 30:29.911
What are you doing here?

30:29.994 --> 30:32.288
I'm supposed to wait to be invited in?

30:32.372 --> 30:34.082
Don't be ridiculous.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.876
Oliver, so sorry. I was on my way.

30:37.502 --> 30:38.753
It's okay, I assumed.

30:39.254 --> 30:43.466
You guys didn't show up, so I thought
I'd better come and rescue you.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.428
Help me understand
why you were going to Oliver's.

30:48.388 --> 30:51.391
She called me. She asked for my help.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.061
Come on, Jules.

30:57.146 --> 30:59.065
Invite yourself out.

30:59.148 --> 31:04.696
Or what? You're gonna excommunicate me?
You already played that card, Bash.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.284
-Are they about to throw down?
-Yup.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.869
Stop it, both of you.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.079
Relax, Dad just wants
to roughhouse a little.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.336
Didn't think you had it in you.

31:20.420 --> 31:24.132
You don't want to play temptress
to what I have in me now.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.968
Grandmother made you a ghoul?

31:27.677 --> 31:31.472
Oh, you always wanted that,
but I can't believe she agreed to it.

31:32.932 --> 31:35.518
Wow, Kim must have really puked
when she went inside you.

31:36.644 --> 31:40.398
Elinor's gonna be so disappointed
if she's not here to see you kill me.

31:40.481 --> 31:42.191
Let him go, sweetheart.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.112
You still on that lie, huh?

31:47.447 --> 31:51.409
At the point you take responsibility
for your behavior, we can talk.

31:51.492 --> 31:53.119
Until then, get out.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.797
Tell Jules she knows where to find me.

32:06.132 --> 32:07.842
And I know where to find you.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.772
-<i>Bring her out.</i>

32:20.855 --> 32:24.067
<i>Bring her out. Bring her out.</i>

32:24.150 --> 32:26.861
<i>Bring her out. Bring her out.</i>

32:26.945 --> 32:31.282
<i>Bring her out.</i>
<i>Bring her out. Bring her out.</i>

32:31.366 --> 32:34.619
<i>Bring her out. Bring her out.</i>

32:34.702 --> 32:39.040
-Bunny, what the hell are you doing?
-I told you, I'm keeping you safe.

32:39.123 --> 32:42.502
You're being a bigoted monster-phobe.
That's not gonna keep me safe.

32:42.585 --> 32:45.463
That's not gonna keep anybody
in this town safe!

32:46.923 --> 32:48.383
You know who it is.

32:50.343 --> 32:53.888
Do you hear yourself?
You're accusing your son?

32:54.472 --> 32:57.850
You knew there was a vampire
at your school and you never told me.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.771
Because she's a good person.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.734
So it is her. I knew it.

33:08.861 --> 33:11.739
Anyone named Calliope
would have to be a vampire.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.537
I'll turn myself in.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.832
It's the only way to fix this.

33:20.915 --> 33:21.916
Stop.

33:23.209 --> 33:24.752
Just wish I could go back.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.463
Rewind this to the beginning.

33:29.757 --> 33:30.842
To our first kiss.

33:32.593 --> 33:34.429
We still would have ended up right here.

33:40.226 --> 33:42.520
-<i>Bring her out.</i>

33:42.603 --> 33:45.648
<i>Bring her out. Bring her out.</i>

33:48.693 --> 33:51.404
If you're looking for your mom,
she's on the lawn out front.

33:51.487 --> 33:55.575
I know. I just tried talking to her,
but I don't even know, I...

33:56.617 --> 33:59.704
-I just can't believe it.
-She's making everything so much worse.

33:59.787 --> 34:00.621
I know that.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.499
She's my mom
and I don't even recognize her.

34:03.583 --> 34:07.545
-Can't even be in the same house anymore.
-Maybe you can live here.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.174
I already called my dad.

34:11.257 --> 34:14.343
He saw Bunny on the news
and he wants me to come stay with him.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.763
Threatened to take her to court
if she didn't let me go.

34:16.846 --> 34:19.974
-This is crazy. You can't go.
-It's crazy if you stay.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.977
-They're putting up monster checkpoints.
-We know.

34:23.686 --> 34:26.189
-With silver tests and everything.
-Oh, my God.

34:28.399 --> 34:32.278
-Maybe you should come with me.
-They'll just find me there.

34:33.738 --> 34:34.947
No one's looking for you.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.910
Those women are literally yelling,
"Bring out the monster."

34:39.494 --> 34:42.872
Yeah, but the monster they want is you.

34:48.669 --> 34:50.880
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour,

34:51.714 --> 34:55.301
but, uh, Bunny Wheeler and her
Desperate Housewives are ruining my lawn.

34:56.135 --> 34:57.845
Lights and sirens ought to do it.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.305
Thing is, I'm off duty.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.685
Hello, Sebastian.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.689
-Bernice?
<i>-You know it, Bash.</i>

35:10.691 --> 35:13.820
Bunny, just a few weeks ago,
I was grilling salmon that I had caught

35:13.903 --> 35:18.157
and sweet corn that you had grown
on that massive pit that Margot decided

35:18.241 --> 35:20.701
I had to have last Father's Day.

35:20.785 --> 35:24.747
Maybe all we need to do is sit down
and share a meal to remember

35:24.831 --> 35:26.415
who we really are.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.000
I'll tell you who we are.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.920
My husband will make a call
and you are going to be arrested

35:31.003 --> 35:32.672
for terrorist threats against the DA

35:32.755 --> 35:35.133
because law and order still matter
in this town.

35:35.716 --> 35:39.178
My mama always told me
to put on clean drawers every day

35:39.262 --> 35:41.389
'cause you never know what might happen.

35:41.472 --> 35:45.143
Well, I guess today what happens is,
I'm going to jail.

35:50.273 --> 35:51.941
You cannot eat her.

35:53.192 --> 35:56.988
Call the chief and tell her to get
that crazy woman off my lawn.

35:58.865 --> 35:59.699
Fine.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.744
But I liked my way better.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.415
<i>Here on East River Street.</i>

36:07.498 --> 36:11.752
<i>As you can see behind me,</i>
<i>traffic has now been backed up for miles.</i>

36:11.836 --> 36:15.298
<i>That congestion is partially</i>
<i>due to the fact that police</i>

36:15.381 --> 36:17.550
<i>have now set up monster checkpoints.</i>

36:18.634 --> 36:21.387
My commute to work tomorrow
will be a breeze.

36:21.470 --> 36:23.472
You could always take a sick day.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.266
Call in with "monster fever."

36:25.975 --> 36:28.436
-What can I get you?
-<i>...onthisdevelopingstory...</i>

36:28.519 --> 36:29.604
What she's got.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.690
<i>...I'm reporting here, Ritvik Dhavale,</i>
<i>forSavannah's numberone...</i>

36:32.773 --> 36:34.692
-Here you go.
-<i>...network for breaking news.</i>

36:36.611 --> 36:38.154
To not killing each other.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.364
At least for tonight.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.957
Who'd have thought Lululemon lunatics
would have pulled this off?

36:50.041 --> 36:52.960
Got the whole city sheltering
in place tonight.

36:53.044 --> 36:57.048
I don't know about you, but I don't have
anywhere else I need to be.

37:26.327 --> 37:28.037
What is this guy doing?

37:29.580 --> 37:31.082
Just Apollo being Apollo.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.812
I'm not really in the mood
for taking things slow.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.735
-What's this?
-A gift from my mother.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.071
-What's this?

38:03.990 --> 38:05.324
The symbol of your bloodline.

38:06.909 --> 38:08.452
You know your Legacy lore.

38:08.536 --> 38:11.664
Yeah, but do you know yours?
The symbols of the other bloodlines?

38:12.581 --> 38:13.624
I could tell you.

38:15.042 --> 38:17.003
But I'd have to bite you first.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.213
Yeah, I'll pass on that.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.759
But, uh, have you seen one
with a red crescent?

38:24.885 --> 38:27.596
-Just curious.
-Be curious in another way.

38:32.685 --> 38:35.313
-This is how you help me?
-What are you doing?

38:35.396 --> 38:36.480
You set me up.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.065
No, I wouldn't do that.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.652
-That's not what this is. Theo, walk away.
-I always fall for the stupid ones.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.196
What the hell did you call me?

38:58.502 --> 39:00.004
Put her down!

39:17.271 --> 39:18.230
Stake her!

39:34.080 --> 39:37.249
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do this, I...

39:37.333 --> 39:40.044
Please, hey, just stay with me.

39:41.003 --> 39:42.088
Just stay with me.

39:44.590 --> 39:47.134
Our next first date will be much better.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.012
Neither of you will remember
much of this one.

39:51.847 --> 39:52.848
Theo...

40:00.398 --> 40:03.609
-Time for her to go.
-With the M.A.A.M.'s outside? No.

40:03.692 --> 40:06.529
I don't know how they got the idea
that she's a vampire,

40:06.612 --> 40:08.948
-but it's out of my hands.
-Mom, listen.

40:09.031 --> 40:10.366
You can't be together.

40:11.575 --> 40:12.785
It won't work.

40:14.995 --> 40:16.288
Let it go.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.541
Your mom's right.

40:19.792 --> 40:20.626
I should go.

40:21.669 --> 40:22.670
Turn myself over.

40:24.338 --> 40:25.965
Let them give me one of their tests...

40:27.883 --> 40:28.884
that I'll pass.

40:28.968 --> 40:32.596
Then I suppose, they'll round up
my family, search my house.

40:34.181 --> 40:37.685
-Do you know what they'll find?
-Mismatched furniture?

40:38.519 --> 40:39.353
Weapons.

40:40.896 --> 40:41.730
Silver.

40:43.232 --> 40:46.652
And the plans to attack
every Legacy vampire at your party.

40:47.361 --> 40:50.322
How long do you think it'll take them
to break down your door?

40:50.406 --> 40:54.994
When this falls on me and my family,
it falls on all of us.

41:03.419 --> 41:04.879
Do not leave this room.

41:15.639 --> 41:16.474
What's wrong?

41:18.601 --> 41:20.227
You actually drew up plans?

41:20.311 --> 41:22.938
Yeah. That's part of the job.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.274
<i>"Whoever fights monsters</i>

41:25.357 --> 41:28.152
<i>should see to it</i>
<i>that he doesn't become a monster."</i>

41:28.235 --> 41:29.945
<i>Friedrich Nietzsche said that.</i>

41:31.030 --> 41:34.909
I know, but just hearing you say it...

41:36.035 --> 41:40.206
Well, it doesn't matter.
We still don't know how to kill Legacies.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.586
One day, you'll figure it out.

41:46.962 --> 41:50.007
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>if you're a monster hunter...</i>

41:51.884 --> 41:54.887
<i>it's possible that your actions</i>
<i>make you a monster too.</i>

41:57.723 --> 41:59.266
Is my heart safe with you?

42:01.268 --> 42:02.102
Forever.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.029
I need to warn my family.

42:12.112 --> 42:13.906
What about the Guild woman?

42:13.989 --> 42:16.534
If you call your parents,
she'll know you're here.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.954
I'll call Theo. He'll know what to do.

42:26.585 --> 42:27.586
<i>Theo?</i>

42:29.380 --> 42:30.381
It's me, Cal.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.426
Something happened to Theo.
