WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:03.727
- PREVIOUSLY ON PSYCH...

00:03.770 --> 00:05.624
- SO THE MAYOR'S DECIDED
TO SEND OVER A CONSULTANT,

00:05.670 --> 00:07.194
MR. HARRIS TROUT.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.606
- I INTEND TO SAVE THE TAXPAYERS
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:09.640 --> 00:11.699
BY TRIMMING THE WORK FORCE
INTO A NEW MODEL

00:11.740 --> 00:13.469
OF PRECISION AND EFFICIENCY.

00:13.510 --> 00:15.068
- CHIEF?

00:15.110 --> 00:16.577
- I GOT
A SIX-MONTH SUSPENSION.

00:16.610 --> 00:17.872
- BUT I HAVE NEWS
FOR ALL OF YOU.

00:17.910 --> 00:19.548
I'M STAYIN'.
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

00:19.580 --> 00:21.343
- BECAUSE YOU'RE THE NEW INTERIM
CHIEF OF POLICE.

00:21.380 --> 00:22.745
- CORRECT.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.439
WE WILL NO LONGER
BE HIRING PSYCHICS,

00:24.490 --> 00:26.617
AND YOU'RE NO LONGER
HEAD DETECTIVE.

00:28.990 --> 00:31.686
I LOVE YOU.

00:31.730 --> 00:34.358
I LOVE YOU TOO.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.459
NOW, AS YOUR NEW INTERIM
POLICE CHIEF,

00:36.500 --> 00:38.092
I WILL GUIDE YOU THROUGH
THIS RAID TODAY

00:38.130 --> 00:39.734
AS WE RID OUR CITY
OF ANOTHER ONE

00:39.770 --> 00:42.330
OF ITS DRUG-DEALING WASHOUTS.

00:42.370 --> 00:45.100
WHERE'S MY HEAD DETECTIVE?

00:45.140 --> 00:47.370
- RIGHT HERE, SIR.
- I SAID MY HEAD DETECTIVE.

00:47.410 --> 00:48.809
WHEN I ASK
FOR A FRESHLY-DEMOTED BEAT COP,

00:48.840 --> 00:50.000
I'LL EXPECT YOU
FRONT AND CENTER.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.699
CAPISCE?
AND LOOSEN THOSE BLUES.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.047
NOBODY NEEDS TO SEE YOU
ADVERTISING YOUR BUSINESS

00:53.080 --> 00:56.083
TO THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
LIKE THAT.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.712
NOW ONE MORE TIME:
WHERE'S MY HEAD DETECTIVE?

00:57.750 --> 00:59.559
- UH, THAT'S...
[laughs]

00:59.590 --> 01:00.989
THAT'S ME.
I'M HERE.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.885
- OKAY, DETECTIVE O'HARA...
- MM-HMM.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.659
- NOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN PROMOTED
TO INTERIM HEAD DETECTIVE,

01:04.690 --> 01:06.191
ON RARE OCCASIONS,
I'LL BE DEPENDING ON YOU.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.629
THIS IS NOT
ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS.

01:07.660 --> 01:10.026
NOW, IN SIX MINUTES,

01:10.070 --> 01:12.698
WE'RE GONNA BE MOVING INSIDE
IN TWO-BY-TWO FORMATIONS.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.889
- YES, GUS,
THAT'S THE POINT.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.669
WE NEED A NEW
BUSINESS VENTURE,

01:15.700 --> 01:17.509
WHICH MEANS I WILL BE
THE MOTIVATIONAL LIFE COACH.

01:17.540 --> 01:18.268
YOU WILL BE MY BOOKING AGENT
AND AUDIENCE PLANT.

01:18.310 --> 01:19.834
YOU DON TWO HATS.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.733
- I DON'T WANNA DON
TWO HATS, SHAWN.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.031
- A BERET UP FRONT.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.502
YOU GOT A LITTLE BEANIE
ON THE CROWN

01:23.550 --> 01:25.074
OF YOUR SMOOTH
CHOCOLATE THUNDERDOME.

01:25.110 --> 01:26.509
- YOU CAN'T JUST BECOME
A LIFE COACH

01:26.550 --> 01:27.778
WITHOUT A LIFE
OR COACHING SKILLS.

01:27.820 --> 01:28.969
- I ALREADY GOT ONE
OF THOSE WORDS

01:29.020 --> 01:30.317
WITH THE DOTS
IN BETWEEN THE LETTERS.

01:30.350 --> 01:32.454
ENCAPSULATES MY PHILOSOPHY.

01:32.490 --> 01:34.754
- IT'S CALLED AN ACRONYM.
- S.E.I.Z.E.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.781
THAT'S "SEIZE," OR AS
THE MAYANS CALLED IT, "SEIZE."

01:36.830 --> 01:38.252
- YOU DO REALIZE
THE LETTERS

01:38.290 --> 01:39.757
ARE SUPPOSED TO STAND
FOR SOMETHING, RIGHT?

01:39.800 --> 01:41.791
- GUESS WHAT THE "S"
IN S.E.I.Z.E STANDS FOR?

01:41.830 --> 01:42.797
- WHAT?
- SEIZE.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.593
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

01:44.630 --> 01:45.392
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET ON THE CASE FAST

01:45.430 --> 01:46.931
BEFORE PSYCH GOES UNDER.

01:46.970 --> 01:48.631
TROUT HATES US,
AND RIGHT NOW

01:48.670 --> 01:50.001
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO STEP FOOT
IN THE STATION

01:50.040 --> 01:51.632
MUCH LESS A CRIME SCENE.

01:51.670 --> 01:53.570
- YOUR NEW LEGAL NAME
IS RECAP MCGHEE.

01:53.610 --> 01:55.077
- NOW, THE PERP
INSIDE THAT HOUSE

01:55.110 --> 01:56.748
IS A VERY
DANGEROUS BIRD,

01:56.780 --> 01:59.578
A LAPPET-FACED VULTURE,
A RED-NECKED OSTRICH.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.679
EITHER WAY, IN THE ANALOGY,
IT'S MOLTING.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.984
- GO'I'I'A FIGURE OUT A WAY
PAST THESE BARRICADES, MAN.

02:04.020 --> 02:06.159
I NEED A STAGE ON WHICH
TO DISPLAY MY SKILLZ

02:06.190 --> 02:08.181
IN FRONT
OF SAUERTROUT THERE.

02:10.690 --> 02:11.827
- LET'S GO TO DINNER.

02:11.860 --> 02:13.748
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ASK ME TWICE.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.654
- HEY, YOU.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.894
YEAH, YOU.
[chuckles]

02:16.930 --> 02:18.329
I'M SHAWN SPENCER.

02:18.370 --> 02:20.190
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
TRENDING ONTWI'I'I'ER.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.504
- HASHTAG WHAT-WOULD-GUS-DO.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.633
- COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE
THE ROSES.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.706
- YEAH, IT'S MY ANNIVERSARY.
- SUPER.

02:26.740 --> 02:28.173
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ASK US ONCE.

02:28.210 --> 02:30.098
WE WOULD LOVE TO JOIN YOU
AND YOUR LOVELY WIFE

02:30.150 --> 02:32.106
FOR A SIX-COURSE DINNER.

02:32.150 --> 02:34.175
- WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT
LETTING ANYONE PAST, SO...

02:34.220 --> 02:35.778
- OH, NO?

02:35.820 --> 02:38.744
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY
NEEDS TO STEP UP

02:38.790 --> 02:40.917
AND SEIZE.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.383
HOW DO I SEIZE, SHAWN?
I'LL TELL YA.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.024
YOU GO RIGHT OVER THERE
AND YOU LET THAT JAGBAG KNOW

02:46.060 --> 02:48.597
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING,
AND I MEAN NOTHING,

02:48.630 --> 02:50.393
THAT IS GONNA KEEP YOU
FROM WINING AND DINING

02:50.430 --> 02:53.331
YOUR WIFE AND YOUR NEW
BLACK AND WHITE BEST FRIENDS.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.838
'CAUSE AFTER WE LEAVE,
SHE'S GONNA GET HANDSY.

02:55.870 --> 02:58.634
- SAY, YES, SHE IS.
- WHAT?

02:58.670 --> 03:00.979
- I DON'T KNOW YOU.
- NO IMPENDING RAID.

03:01.010 --> 03:03.604
NO GUNS, NO COPS.
NOTHING'S GONNA STOP YOU.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.971
NOW, GO.
SEIZE!

03:06.010 --> 03:07.443
SEIZE.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.289

03:09.320 --> 03:12.141
YOU GOT THIS, BRO.
YOU GOT THIS.

03:12.190 --> 03:13.953
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.218
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE IN
FROM EAST TO WEST.

03:15.260 --> 03:16.113
SOME OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW
WHICH WAY IS EAST

03:16.160 --> 03:17.980
AND WHICH WAY IS WEST.

03:18.030 --> 03:19.895
THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S WEST, THAT'S EAST.

03:19.930 --> 03:20.954
- EXCUSE ME, OFFICER?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.889
[tense orchestration]

03:23.930 --> 03:28.993

SEIZE.

03:30.610 --> 03:31.736
SEIZE.
- UH, LISTEN.

03:31.770 --> 03:33.829
I...

03:33.880 --> 03:36.075
MY HOUSE IS RIGHT THERE,
AND IT'S MY ANNIVERSARY.

03:36.110 --> 03:37.805
AND...
- AND WE ARE WITH HIM, TROUT.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.648
- OLD FRIENDS.
- HM.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.341
OFFICER LASSITER,
ARREST THIS MAN

03:42.390 --> 03:44.483
FOR INTERFERING
WITH A POLICE INVESTIGATION.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.817
- WE'RE KIDDING.
WE'RE NOT WITH THIS DUDE.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.250
- JUST MET THE GUY.
- NO.

03:49.760 --> 03:50.886
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET TO MY HOUSE.

03:50.930 --> 03:52.989
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

03:53.030 --> 03:55.021
YOU'LL BE PROCESSED AND RELEASED
WITHIN THE HOUR.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.597
WELL, MAYBE.

04:00.940 --> 04:03.738
- THERE'S A CHANCE THAT
ONE OF YOU MIGHT DIE TODAY.

04:03.770 --> 04:05.829
PROBABLY YOU.
COULD BE YOU.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.337
COULD BE YOU.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.836
[suspenseful music]

04:08.880 --> 04:10.472
- OH, IT'S GO TIME, DADDY-O.

04:10.510 --> 04:18.986

04:21.860 --> 04:23.282
- OKAY, IS EVERYONE
CRYSTAL CLEAR NOW?

04:23.330 --> 04:24.854
OKAY, LET'S MOVE.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.221
LET'S MOVE, COME ON.
- UH, UH, CHIEF?

04:26.260 --> 04:27.818
- YEAH?

04:27.860 --> 04:29.919

THE RAID.

[rock music]

04:32.970 --> 04:40.206

04:40.240 --> 04:42.379
- I'VE CALLED YOU ALL DOWN HERE
FOR GOOD REASON.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.298
THE RAID THAT TOOK PLACE HERE
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO

04:44.350 --> 04:45.578
IS A PRIME EXAMPLE
OF WHAT I'M CALLING

04:45.610 --> 04:47.168
"THE NEW SANTA BARBARA,"

04:47.220 --> 04:49.040
A CITY BEING SWEPT CLEAN
OF VERMIN,

04:49.080 --> 04:52.117
YELLOW-BELLIED WEASELS,
BLACK-FOOTED FERRETS.

04:52.150 --> 04:53.981
AND THE HEROICS
THAT TOOK PLACE HERE

04:54.020 --> 04:57.251
ARE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT
AND WILL NOT GO UNNOTICED.

04:57.290 --> 04:59.793
AN UNNAMED OFFICER SUCCESSFULLY
APPREHENDED OUR SUSPECT

04:59.830 --> 05:01.491
WITHOUT A SINGLE SHOT
BEING FIRED.

05:01.530 --> 05:04.090
THAT IS THE NEW SBPD.

05:04.130 --> 05:06.189
NO NAMES, NO FACES.

05:06.230 --> 05:08.095
MEN AND THREE WOMEN
SERVING THEIR CITY

05:08.140 --> 05:11.837
AND BEING LED AND NURTURED
BY ME, HARRIS TROUT.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.030

05:57.220 --> 05:59.814
I WANT EVERYONE HERE
TO THINK

05:59.860 --> 06:02.055
ABOUT THE IMPACT
OF MY DEATH

06:02.090 --> 06:03.455
JUST FOR A MINUTE.

06:03.490 --> 06:05.378
LET IT MARINATE.

06:05.430 --> 06:09.628
SWISH IT AROUND THE EMPTY SPACE
BETWEEN YOUR EARS.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.490
IT'S IMMEASURABLY DEVASTATING,
ISN'T IT?

06:11.530 --> 06:15.239
NOW, LET'S CATCH THIS BASTARD
AND LET'S CATCH HIM FAST.

06:15.270 --> 06:17.135
I'M GONNA HAND THE FLOOR OVER
TO DETECTIVE O'HARA.

06:17.170 --> 06:18.262
TODAY IS HER FIRST BRIEFING.

06:18.310 --> 06:19.504
TRY NOT TO MAKE THIS
THE MOST

06:19.540 --> 06:21.371
HUMILIATING DAY
OF YOUR LIFE, OKAY?

06:21.410 --> 06:23.207
- HM.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.275
- TAKE IT AWAY.

UH...YOU KNOW WHAT?

A LITTLE CLOSER?

YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD, THANK YOU.

HAVE US ARRESTED.

06:45.570 --> 06:48.494
WE BOTH KNOW THAT YOUS AND MEES
HIT ROCK BOTTOM, OKAY?

PSYCH HASN'T HAD A CASE
IN WHAT FEELS LIKE A YEAR.

06:50.270 --> 06:51.339

A LITTLE COACHING.

YOUR LOWER INTESTINE

HAS BEEN TURNING A BLIND EYE

07:45.760 --> 07:47.125

BECAUSE WHILE YOU HAVE BEEN
ACTING QUITE HEROICALLY,

07:52.000 --> 07:53.695
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN
SPEAKING UP.

07:53.740 --> 07:58.006

ARE MUCH LOUDER THAN ACTIONS.

AND, OF COURSE, IN ENGLAND.

08:13.590 --> 08:16.058
- YOU'RE LOSING HIM, SHAWN.
- S.E.I.Z.E.

08:16.090 --> 08:18.183
S-E-I-Z-E,

08:18.230 --> 08:20.118
AS IN
SEIZE THIS MOMENT.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.697
BESIDES, NOBODY CAN HEAR A WORD
JULES IS SAYING ANYWAY

08:22.730 --> 08:25.460
'CAUSE SHE FEELS GUILTY BAGGINS
ABOUT TAKING YOUR GIG.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.798
SO LET
THE STERN BUSH BREATHE...

08:27.840 --> 08:31.606
BE HEARD.
SEIZE.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.130
- NOW, WE HAVE NO DESCRIPTION
OF THE SHOOTER.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.329
UM, BUT THE GOOD
NEWS 15--

08:34.380 --> 08:36.268
- THE GOOD NEWS
IS THAT I AM BACK.

08:36.310 --> 08:38.574
BUT AS THOSE OF YOU
WHO WITNESSED TODAY'S HEROICS

08:38.610 --> 08:41.977
ALREADY KNOW,
I WAS NEVER REALLY GONE.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.180
NOW, SOME OF YOU MAY BE
UNDER THE IMPRESSION

08:43.220 --> 08:44.812
THAT MY MIDDLE NAME
IS "DANGER."

08:44.850 --> 08:47.159
IT IS NOT.
IT'S JEBEDIAH.

08:47.190 --> 08:48.919
- OOH, ROUGH START.
- AH, JEEZ.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.552
- BUT IT SHOULD BE DANGER...

08:50.590 --> 08:52.126
BECAUSE SOME LOWLIFE
ASSASSIN WAN NABE

08:52.160 --> 08:53.491
THINKS THEY CAN TAKE A SHOT
AT ONE OF US

08:53.530 --> 08:54.895
AND GET AWAY WITH IT?

08:54.930 --> 08:56.192
WELL, NOT WHILE
I'VE GOT A PULSE

08:56.230 --> 08:58.391
UNDER MY PERFORMANCE ZONE
MALE SPANX.

08:58.430 --> 09:00.864
NOW, I MAY BE REQUIRED
TO WRITE NO LESS

09:00.900 --> 09:02.492
THAN 80 TRAFFIC CITATIONS
THIS MONTH,

09:02.540 --> 09:05.168
BUT I WILL NOT REST
UNTIL THE MISCREANT

09:05.210 --> 09:07.303
WHO TOOK A SHOT AT OUR CHIEF
IS CAUGHT.

09:07.340 --> 09:09.501
- HE'S ON A ROLL NOW.
- JEBEDIAH?

09:09.540 --> 09:12.270
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
- NOW, YOU MARK MY WORDS.

09:12.310 --> 09:13.777
AND YOU MARK THEM WELL.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.311
I, CARLTON JEBEDIAH LASSITER,

09:16.350 --> 09:18.147
WILL GO OUT IN A HAILSTORM
OF BULLETS

09:18.190 --> 09:20.351
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES
TO CATCH THIS SCUMBAG.

09:20.390 --> 09:22.517
I WILL LEAVE

OF THE CITY
I LOVE SO MUCH,

09:27.960 --> 09:30.520
BECAUSE THIS IS MY HOUSE.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.492
AND WITH EVERY FEARLESS FIBER
OF MY BEING,

09:32.530 --> 09:37.308
I SAY UNTO YOU:
THIS SCUMBAG IS GOING DOWN.

YOUR OLD JOB BACK?

10:06.570 --> 10:08.333
- NO, BUT I CAN ALMOST
GUARANTEE YOU

10:08.370 --> 10:10.338
THAT IT IS UNDER REVIEW.

10:10.370 --> 10:12.429

10:12.470 --> 10:15.200
- GOOD? NO.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.477

ON HIS BIRTHDAY?

17:32.910 --> 17:36.175
- YES. MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH HARRIS IS COMPLICATED.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.882
HE RESENTS ME
BECAUSE I LEFT HIS DAD

17:38.920 --> 17:42.788
FOR THE POOL GUY
AZUCAR DE LA PUNTO.

17:42.820 --> 17:44.082
[chuckles]

17:44.130 --> 17:46.018
- SUGAR...

17:46.060 --> 17:48.551
- AND I RESENT HIM
FOR HIS PERSONALITY.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.524
NO, I LOVE MY SON
BUT I HATE HIS INSIDES.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.731
AND COULD I GIVE YOU
25 BUCKS EACH

17:53.770 --> 17:55.567
JUST TO TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

17:55.600 --> 17:57.500
- SHE'S NOT GONNA KEEP THIS DEAL
ON THE TABLE FOREVER.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.167
both: STOP IT!

17:59.210 --> 18:01.201
- MRS. TROUT,
WHAT'S GOING ON, MA'AM,

18:01.240 --> 18:02.605
IS THAT SOMEONE TRIED
TO KILL YOUR SON

18:02.640 --> 18:04.540
WITH A .38
VERY MUCH LIKE THAT ONE.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.673
SEVERAL SHOTS WERE FIRED.
- DID THEY HIT HIM?

18:06.710 --> 18:08.109
- NO.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.515
DON'T YOU MEAN
"DID I HIT HIM?"

18:09.550 --> 18:10.881
- NO, I DON'T.
YOU KNOW WHY?

18:11.950 --> 18:13.679
[all shout]

18:13.720 --> 18:16.382
- TROUT'S MOM.
- HEY, HEY, HEY, TAKE A POWDER!

18:16.420 --> 18:18.285
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

18:21.300 --> 18:22.790
HOW DO I TELL TROUT

18:22.830 --> 18:25.560
HIS MOM
IS IN INTERROGATION ROOM ONE?

18:27.270 --> 18:29.830
- WELL, LASSIE,

18:29.870 --> 18:31.861
I'M SO GLAD
YOU ASKED THAT,

18:31.910 --> 18:34.003
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IS
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

18:34.040 --> 18:36.770
FOR YOU TO UTILIZE THE SECOND
LETTER IN S.E.I.Z.E...

18:36.810 --> 18:38.141
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

18:38.180 --> 18:40.148
- WHICH, OF COURSE,
STANDS FOR "EGGS,"

18:40.180 --> 18:42.011
AS IN YOU GOTTA BREAK A FEW

18:42.050 --> 18:44.041
IN ORDER TO MAKE AN OMELET
OR PANCAKES

18:44.090 --> 18:46.445
OR MUFFIN TOPS
OR DIJONNAISE,

18:46.490 --> 18:47.889
'CAUSE THERE IS EGGS
IN EVERYTHING.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.808
AM I RIGHT, GUS?
- NO.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.157
- THIS IS
A DELICATE SITUATION.

18:51.190 --> 18:52.748
BUT THE BEST THING
YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW

18:52.790 --> 18:54.394
IS MARCH
INTO TROUT'S OFFICE,

18:54.430 --> 18:56.853
LOOK HIM IN THE EYES,
AND SAY, "HEY, SAUERTROUT...

18:56.900 --> 18:58.424
[laughs]

18:58.470 --> 19:00.893
I AIN'T AFRAID TO CRACK
NO EGGS."

19:00.940 --> 19:02.794
- OH, GOD.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.205
- YOU DO REALIZE
THAT LASSIE'S

19:04.240 --> 19:05.605
PROBABLY GONNA
GET FIRED, RIGHT?

19:05.640 --> 19:06.538
- YEAH, BUT WE MIGHT
GET PAID--

19:06.570 --> 19:08.470
-AAH!
-AAH!

19:10.280 --> 19:13.443
[light music]

19:13.480 --> 19:18.486
*

19:18.520 --> 19:21.159
- 'SCUSE ME, CHIEF.
- LASSITER.

19:21.190 --> 19:23.010
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE
A GOOD TIME TO YOU?

19:23.060 --> 19:25.688
- I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, SIR.

19:27.760 --> 19:31.969
_ THE EYES ARE DELICATE,
MYSTERIOUS FIGS,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.093
A COMPLICATED COMBINATION
OF AQUEOUS HUMOR FLUID

19:34.140 --> 19:35.892
AND GANGLION
PHOTOSENSITIVE CELLS.

19:35.940 --> 19:38.101
NOW, WERE I TO LOSE
MY SIGHT,

19:38.140 --> 19:40.836
WHICH IS A 12% CHANCE,

- NOW, WHAT ELSE
COULD YOU POSSIBLY NEED?

19:49.520 --> 19:51.044
- WELL, SIR,
I JUST CAME IN

19:51.090 --> 19:54.218
TO INFORM YOU THAT...

19:56.260 --> 19:57.921
NEVERMIND.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.867
- EGGS.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.538
EGGS.
- NO, I'M NOT G--

20:07.570 --> 20:08.889
- EGGS.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.936
- CHIEF, YOUR MOTHER
IS IN INTERROGATION ROOM ONE,

20:13.980 --> 20:16.676
AND I THINK SHE MAY BE
THE PERSON

20:16.710 --> 20:19.941
WHO TRIED
TO SHOOT YOU DEAD.

20:19.980 --> 20:22.540
- I WANT FIRST CRACK
AT HER.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.081
DID YOU DO IT OR NOT?
TELL ME.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.816
- I AM A STABBER NOT A SHOOTER.
YOU KNOW THAT.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.056
- LOOK, I HOPE DAD IS IN HEAVEN
RIGHT NOW WATCHING.

20:28.090 --> 20:30.388
- THE DEVIL
IS MAKING S'MORES

20:30.430 --> 20:31.920
WITH HIS SPONGY BRAIN.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.086
- SEE, I KNEW YOU NEVER
LOVED DAD.

20:33.130 --> 20:35.394
- NOBODY EVER LOVED
THAT S.O.B.

20:35.430 --> 20:37.159
- LOOK, HE SUPPORTED
ALL MY CREATIVE DESIRES.

20:37.200 --> 20:40.590
- WELL, HE SUPPORTED HIS EMPTY
HEAD ON HIS TRIPLE CHIN.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.130
- HE HAD A THYROID PROBLEM, MA.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:42.170 --> 20:43.967
BALLISTICS IS RUNNING
THE TROUT'S MOM'S .38

20:44.010 --> 20:45.068
TO SEE IF IT'S THE ONE
USED IN THE SHOOTING.

20:45.110 --> 20:46.862
- LOOKS LIKE THIS CASE
IS OVER.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.207
- ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO
WAS DANCE.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.549
- OH, YOU AND GINGER ROGERS.

20:50.580 --> 20:51.945
- WE HAVE A REPORT
OF SHOTS FIRED

20:51.980 --> 20:53.868
AT A COFFEE SHOP CALLED
"JAWA THE CUPP."

20:53.920 --> 20:55.114
WITNESSES SAY THEY SAW
A WHITE VAN DRIVING AWAY.

20:55.150 --> 20:56.879
- WAIT A SECOND.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.217
THAT MEANS TROUT'S MOM
IS NOT OUR SHOOTER.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.547
- NO.

20:59.590 --> 21:00.579
NO!

21:02.690 --> 21:04.988
I'M DISAPPOINTED, IS ALL.
- MM.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.248
- WE'VE GOT ONE INJURED
ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.995
I'M HEADING THERE NOW
TO INTERVIEW THE VICTIM.

21:09.030 --> 21:10.588
CARLTON, WOULD YOU PLEASE
COME WITH ME?

21:10.630 --> 21:12.427
I COULD REALLY USE YOUR HELP
ON THIS CASE.

21:12.470 --> 21:13.960
- [muffled]
MAYBE WE SHOULD COME TOO.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.036
- YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
- YEAH.

21:16.070 --> 21:18.959
- OKAY, JUST DON'T TELL
WHAT'S-HIS-FACE.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.069
- AZUCAR WAS A TERRIBLE POOL GUY
AND A THIEF!

21:21.110 --> 21:24.045
- HE KNEW A DOZEN WAYS
TO FIGHT ALGAE.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.469
- OH, MY GOD, I DON'T WANNA
THINK ABOUT THAT, MA.

21:26.510 --> 21:28.876
- SO, UM,
HOW DO I TELL TROUT

21:28.920 --> 21:30.273
THAT HIS MOM
IS ACTUALLY INNOCENT

21:30.320 --> 21:31.412
AND THAT THE PERSON
WHO TRIED TO KILL HIM

21:31.450 --> 21:33.281
IS STILL OUT THERE
RUNNING RAMPANT?

21:33.320 --> 21:35.208
- WELL, LASSIE, I'M SO GLAD
YOU CHOSE THIS MOMENT

21:35.260 --> 21:37.012
TO MAKE THAT INQUIRY.

21:37.060 --> 21:38.721
WHAT YOU NEED
TO FOCUS ON

21:38.760 --> 21:41.524
IS THE "I" IN S.E.I.Z.E...
- SHAWN.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.723
- WHICH, OF COURSE,
STANDS FOR "I DON'T KNOW."

21:44.770 --> 21:46.089
- OH, MY GOSH.
- OR...

21:46.130 --> 21:48.166
MM-MM?
BECAUSE SOMETIMES,

21:48.200 --> 21:50.839
BELIEVE IT OR NOT LASSIE,
IT'S SUPER SWEET

21:50.870 --> 21:53.031
TO NOT KNOW.

21:53.070 --> 21:55.334
- OH, GOD.

21:56.910 --> 21:58.468
- VANCE, DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK
AT THE SHOOTER?

21:58.510 --> 22:00.307
- NO, BUTI PROFILED HIM.

22:00.350 --> 22:03.148
UNEMPLOYED, DUMPY, SINGLE,
5'10" AND UNDER.

22:03.180 --> 22:05.887
THE KING KONG OF LOSERS.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.854
[spits]
AW, COME ON.

22:07.890 --> 22:09.414
BUT WHAT IS THIS?
HEY, NURSE.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.325
CH EWBACCA-CCINO
FROM JAWA THE CUPP

22:11.360 --> 22:13.225
ON THE FLY,
OR I'M GONNA SUE THIS HELLHOLE

22:13.260 --> 22:14.750
FOR BOTCHING MY BANDAGES.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.222
AND HURRY UP.

22:16.260 --> 22:17.921
I GOT A FULL BEDPAN
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.665
LOOK, ARE WE ABOUT
DONE HERE?

22:19.700 --> 22:21.236
I MEAN, I REALIZE YOU'RE ALL
PUBLIC SERVANTS

22:21.270 --> 22:23.067
WITH LOW-PAYING JOBS TO DO,

22:23.100 --> 22:24.738
BUT V-MAC'S GOT CALLS
TO BANG,

22:24.770 --> 22:26.704
PEEPS TO SEE,
LIVES TO RUIN.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.879
- WELL, V-MAC--
DOPE HANDLE--

22:28.910 --> 22:30.377
THE POSSIBILITY REMAINS
THAT THE ATTEMPT

22:30.410 --> 22:32.469
ON YOUR LIFE
WAS NOT COMPLETELY RANDOM.

22:32.510 --> 22:34.978
- DO YOU BY CHANCE KNOW A MAN
NAMED HARRIS TROUT?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.817
- THAT'S A N-C'JUPID NAME.

22:36.850 --> 22:38.408
- DO YOU KNOW ANYONE
WHO MAY WANT YOU DEAD?

22:38.450 --> 22:41.112
- MY WIFE,
MY MAIN MISTRESS.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.481
OOH, MY MISTRESS'
SMOKING-HOT SISTER.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.021

22:46.060 --> 22:47.698
A LOT
OF THEIR WIVES AND SISTERS.

22:47.730 --> 22:50.255
- OKAY, I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE,
RIGHT, CARLTON?

22:50.300 --> 22:51.392
- [coughs]

22:51.430 --> 22:52.897
- [sneezes]

22:57.870 --> 23:00.430
- CARLTON?
- HUH?

23:01.710 --> 23:04.042
OH.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.571
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WAIT A SECOND, YOU GUYS.

23:06.610 --> 23:09.317
I THINK THERE IS A CONNECTION
BETWEEN V-MAC HERE AND TROUT.

23:09.350 --> 23:12.387
OUR KILLER
IS TARGETING A-HOLES.

23:14.990 --> 23:16.981
THINK ABOUT IT: HE'S CLEANING UP
THE CITY ONE A-HOLE AT A TIME.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.487
HE'S WHACKIN' A-HOLES.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.054
EITHER THAT,
OR HE WANTS TO BE THE G-POOBAH

23:20.090 --> 23:22.456
OF ALL THE A-HOLES.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.821
BY THE WAY,
I GOTTA MAKE A PHONE CALL.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.168
I KNOW SOMEONE
WHO'S IN GRAVE DANGER.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.031
LISTEN TO ME:
THERE IS A CRAZY PERSON

23:29.070 --> 23:31.868
ON THE LOOSE,
AND HE'S TARGETING YOUR KIND.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.502
- YEAH, WHAT KIND
IS THAT, SHAWN?

23:33.540 --> 23:34.575
- THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT, OKAY?

23:34.610 --> 23:38.068
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS...

23:38.110 --> 23:39.441
- SHAWN, IS THIS
SOME KIND OF JOKE,

23:39.480 --> 23:41.038
OR AM I REALLY IN DANGER?

23:41.080 --> 23:43.344
SHAWN?
ARE YOU STILL THERE?

23:43.380 --> 23:45.610
I'M SERIOUS.
- JUST STAY ALIVE.

23:50.020 --> 23:53.023
- "DEAR SON:
EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE NEVER MET,

23:53.060 --> 23:54.527
DON'T BE SAD."
- ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE DEAL.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.152
JUST GOT OFF THE HORN
WITH VANCE MCMILLAN,

23:56.200 --> 23:57.997
THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ATTACKED
EARLIER TODAY?

23:58.030 --> 23:59.429
FIRST OF ALL,
THE GUY'S A GEM.

23:59.470 --> 24:00.835
I FEEL LIKE I'VE KNOWN HIM
MY WHOLE LIFE.

24:00.870 --> 24:02.531
GOLF TRIP IN THE WORKS?
YOU BETCHA.

24:02.570 --> 24:04.231
SECOND OF ALL, THE PERSONAL
ITEMS WE BOOKED INTO EVIDENCE

24:04.270 --> 24:05.339
FROM HIS SWEET YELLOW CORVETTE--
THOSE NEED RETURNING.

24:05.370 --> 24:06.803
ALL RIGHT?
- WELL...

24:06.840 --> 24:08.205
IS HE GONNA COME BY
THE STATION OR--

24:08.240 --> 24:10.003
- HEY, THE MAN HAS A BUSINESS
TO RUN, OKAY?

24:10.040 --> 24:11.348
AND YOU'RE SITTING HERE
WASTING CITY STATIONERY

24:11.380 --> 24:13.245
ON A LETTER
TO YOUR IMAGINARY FRIEND

24:13.280 --> 24:17.148
RAOUL THE HAIRLESS WOLF,
WHO LIVES IN YOUR PANTRY.

24:17.180 --> 24:18.909
YEAH,

24:18.950 --> 24:20.884
HE'LL BE LOOKING OUT FOR YOU,

24:26.560 --> 24:28.448
- SO YOU'RE TROUT'S
ERRAND BOY NOW?

24:28.500 --> 24:31.492
NO, YOU WILL GET OVER THIS,
CARLTON JEBEDIAH.

24:31.530 --> 24:33.464
YOU WILL GET YOUR HEAD
BACK IN THE GAME

24:33.500 --> 24:36.196
AND YOU'LL GET BACK
TO DODGING BULLETS.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.629
OH, JEEZ!

24:38.670 --> 24:41.002
DON'T BE A WHITE VAN.
DON'T BE A WHITE VAN.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.838
BE TAUPE, OR OFF-WHITE,
OR BEIGE.

24:43.880 --> 24:48.374
OFF-WHITE,

JEEZ.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.141

OKAY.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.151
[panﬁng]

24:56.190 --> 24:57.919
NO, YOU CAN'T.

25:00.660 --> 25:02.252
OKAY, LISTEN TO ME.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.518
I REALLY WANNA BE THERE
FOR YOU, LITTLE BUDDY.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.822
BUT I'M KIND OF IN A LITTLE
PICKLE RIGHT NOW

25:06.870 --> 25:08.098
AND I COULD REALLY USE
YOUR HELP.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.199
SO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.798
REALLY?

25:11.840 --> 25:12.966
OKAY.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.369
- SPEAKING OF WHICH,

25:19.410 --> 25:22.413
I ALSO HAVE A S.E.I.Z.E
APPOINTMENT AT 9:00 AM.

25:22.450 --> 25:24.111
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

25:24.150 --> 25:26.118
- DID SHE ADMIT
THAT SHE NEEDS HELP?

25:26.150 --> 25:27.708
- SHE ADMITTED
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

25:27.760 --> 25:31.218
- THINGS LIKE WHAT?
- WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD, LASSIE?

25:33.390 --> 25:35.654
- IS THAT THE WHITE VAN?
- UH-HUH.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.190
- THAT MEANS THE TROUT SHOOTING
AND THE V-MAC SHOOTING

25:37.230 --> 25:38.390
ARE DEFINITELY NOT RANDOM.

25:38.430 --> 25:40.660
- NUH-UH.
THIS RUTHLESS PSYCHOPATH

25:40.700 --> 25:42.338
HAS COME BACK
TO FINISH OFF VANCE.

25:42.370 --> 25:43.735
- THAT MEANS TROUT
IS STILL IN DANGER.

25:43.770 --> 25:45.203
WE SHOULD WARN HIM.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.639
- WELL, SHOULD
WE REALLY, THOUGH?

25:46.670 --> 25:49.036
- HM.
- ALL RIGHT, LASSIE.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.048
LET'S DO THIS LIKE MEN.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.206

25:52.250 --> 25:55.139
[suspenseful music]

25:55.180 --> 26:03.155
*

26:05.830 --> 26:07.559
- LASSIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.022
GET UP HERE.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.862
- YOU GUYS GO. HERE.
- WHAT?

26:12.900 --> 26:14.037
- MAN, I'M NOT TAKING
YOUR GUN.

26:14.070 --> 26:15.992
- JUST TAKE IT, GUS.
- HELL NO.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.632
- SPENCER, TAKE MY GUN.
- I'M NOT TA--

26:17.670 --> 26:19.467
YOU NEED
TO GATHER YOURSELF, MAN.

26:19.510 --> 26:21.273
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU

26:21.310 --> 26:23.403
BUT YOU NEED TO GRAB HOLD
OF THE FOURTH LETTER

26:23.440 --> 26:25.146
IN S.E.I.Z.E.,
WHICH IS THE "I."

26:25.180 --> 26:27.102
- IS THE "Z."
- WHICH STANDS FOR "ZEBRA."

26:27.150 --> 26:28.572
YOU NEED TO EMBRACE
YOUR STRIPES

26:28.620 --> 26:31.088
BECAUSE THEY ARE BLACK,
AND THEY ARE WHITE,

26:31.120 --> 26:32.587
AND THEY ARE ZIGZAGGY.

26:32.620 --> 26:35.157
- THEY'RE NOT ZIGZAGGY.
- WHO ARE YOU, MAN?

26:35.190 --> 26:37.488
YOU ARE CARLTON
SKIP-THE-MIDDLE-NAME LASSITER.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.056
AND YOU NEED TO STONE UP.

26:39.090 --> 26:40.557
AND YOU NEED
TO TICKLE THE STONES,

26:40.590 --> 26:42.649
AND YOU NEED
TO SEIZE THE DAY.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.329
- MY STRIPES HAVE CHANGED,
ALL RIGHT?

26:47.370 --> 26:48.894
[glass shatters]
- HERE--TAKE IT.

26:48.940 --> 26:51.204
TAKE MY GUN!
- OH, MY GOSH.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.639
- KEEP AN EYE
ON THE VAN, ALL RIGHT?

26:52.670 --> 26:54.433
MAKE SURE NOBODY COMES OUT.
WE'LL GO SNOOP.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.777
GOD!

26:58.410 --> 27:00.071
- DAMN IT.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.656
- DUDE...

27:07.690 --> 27:10.113
I THINK THIS WHOLE
DEMOTION-TO-BEAT-COP THING

27:10.160 --> 27:11.889
IS REALLY JACKING
WITH LASSIE'S HEAD.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.057
- NOT TO MENTION SUCKING
ALL THE LIFE RIGHT OUT OF HIM.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.692
- YEAH.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.426
- MY SITUATION HAS CHANGED,

27:20.470 --> 27:23.268
AND I'M NOT PHYSICALLY CAPABLE
OF PURSUING THIS CASE

27:23.300 --> 27:24.267
ON MY OWN.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.607
- GUS'
- SHH!

27:25.640 --> 27:27.369
WHAT?

27:27.410 --> 27:28.604
- I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG
WITH LASSIE.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.245
- WHAT?
- I THINK HE'S DYING.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.406
- WHAT?
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, SHAWN.

27:32.450 --> 27:33.940
COME ON, SON.

27:33.980 --> 27:35.675
- THINK ABOUT THE LAST
24 HOURS, MAN.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.278
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE JUST
SAW OUTSIDE.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.446
THE MAN CAN BARELY MOVE.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.481
HIS DISEASE-RIDDEN BODY--

27:40.520 --> 27:43.455
RIGHT ON THE CUSP OF THROWING IN
THE TOWEL OF LIFE.

27:43.490 --> 27:45.651
- OH...MY...GOSH.

27:45.690 --> 27:47.920
LASSIE'S DYING.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.158
- OH, NO.
WHAT IS THAT?

27:52.200 --> 27:54.134
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?

27:56.540 --> 27:58.030
WHAT IS THAT?
- [gaSPSJ

27:58.070 --> 27:59.560
I'M TRYING TO SHED TEARS
FOR LASSIE.

27:59.610 --> 28:02.534
THEY WON'T COME,
AND I FEEL ASHAMED.

28:02.580 --> 28:04.309
- DON'T DO THAT.
STOP THAT.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.408
[loud thud]

28:13.020 --> 28:14.681
YEAH, MAYBE WE CAN GIVE HIM
ONE MORE GIFT,

28:14.720 --> 28:16.051
YOU KNOW,
BEFORE HE'S WORM FOOD,

28:16.090 --> 28:17.819
HELP HIM
SOLVE THIS CASE.

28:17.860 --> 28:20.283
GETS PROMOTED BACK TO DETECTIVE,
HAVE A LITTLE PEACE

28:20.330 --> 28:22.321
BEFORE THEY LOWER HIM
INTO THE GROUND.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.429
[clank]

28:25.700 --> 28:28.134
[gunshots]
[overlapping yelling]

28:37.710 --> 28:38.745
- [shrill whimpering]

28:38.780 --> 28:40.304
[trigger clicking]

28:47.290 --> 28:49.656
- LASSIE.
- I-I COULDN'T GET HIM.

28:49.690 --> 28:51.555
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

28:51.590 --> 28:52.727
WE UNDERSTAND.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.194
- IS VANCE OKAY?

29:00.400 --> 29:03.289
- V-MAC IS NOT OKAY.

29:07.570 --> 29:09.379
- SO YOU HAD THE DROP
ON OUR BAD GUY,

29:09.410 --> 29:11.344
AND SOMEHOW,
WITH HIM DEAD TO RIGHTS,

29:11.380 --> 29:13.598
YOU LET HIM GET AWAY?

29:13.650 --> 29:15.345
LOOK AT ME
WHEN I'M TALKING TO YA.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.348
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FEARLESS
DESIRE TO DIE, OFFICER?

29:17.380 --> 29:18.540
- IT--IT'S TOTALLY
STILL THERE.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.784
- OH, IT BETTER BE.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.356
OTHERWISE,
WHAT GOOD ARE YOU FOR?

29:21.390 --> 29:22.914
LUCKY FOR YOU,
THE TIME OF DEATH ON VANCE

29:22.960 --> 29:24.689
WAS PLACED
AT 7:30 P.M., RIGHT?

29:24.730 --> 29:26.618
SO WHILE YOUR INCOMPETENCE
COST US OUR KILLER,

29:26.660 --> 29:28.548
THERE WAS NO WAY
TO SAVE POOR VANCE

29:28.600 --> 29:29.692
BECAUSE HIS VALUABLE LIFE
WAS GONE

29:29.730 --> 29:30.754
BEFORE YOU GOT THERE.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.267
NOT ONLY
DID THIS CITY LOSE

29:32.300 --> 29:33.369
ONE OF ITS FINEST
CITIZENS TONIGHT,

29:33.400 --> 29:34.867
BUT VANCE MCMILLAN
WAS A MAN

29:34.900 --> 29:36.731
THAT I WAS ON THE VERGE
OF CALLING "HOME SKILLET."

29:36.770 --> 29:39.409
AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
I'M IN GRAVE DANGER, RIGHT?

29:39.440 --> 29:41.829
WHO DO YOU THINK THIS MAN
IS COMING FOR NEXT?

29:41.880 --> 29:43.871
DON'T SHRUG
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW.

29:43.910 --> 29:45.468
I WANT YOU TO HAND OVER
YOUR TICKET BOOK AND PEN

29:45.510 --> 29:47.273
RIGHT NOW.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.786
THE OTHER PEN TOO.

30:13.540 --> 30:16.100
- NO.
LASSIE.

30:16.140 --> 30:16.799
THE MAN'S PERISHING, GUS.
- MM-HMM.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.478
- HE'S A PERISHER.

30:18.510 --> 30:19.442
- THAT'S SOMETHING
DIFFERENT, SHAWN.

30:19.480 --> 30:20.777
- MM?

30:20.810 --> 30:22.539
- HEY, GUYS.

30:22.580 --> 30:24.548
WE TRACED THE WHITE VAN BACK
TO A TONY DELFIN.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.239
WE JUST SEARCHED
HIS HOME.

30:26.290 --> 30:27.780
NEIGHBORS HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN A COUPLE DAYS.

30:27.820 --> 30:29.651
- MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
HE'S BEEN ON A RAMPAGE.

30:29.690 --> 30:31.328
- I'M STILL NOT SURE
HOW HE'S LINKED TO TROUT

30:31.360 --> 30:32.657
AND VANCE MCMILLAN,
SO I'M GONNA HEAD DOWN

30:32.690 --> 30:33.896
TO THE FISH MARKET
WHERE HE WORKS SECURITY

30:33.930 --> 30:35.295
AND SEE WHAT ELSE
WE CAN FIND OUT.

30:35.330 --> 30:38.128
- SO MAYBE A LITTLE BIT
OF A BACKUP, HM?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.728
- OKAY.

30:39.770 --> 30:41.590
BUT WE NEVER HAD
THIS CONVERSATION.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.369
I'M GONNA ASK LASSIE
TO COME AGAIN AS WELL.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.867
HE JUST LOOKS SO SAD.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.730
I JUST THINK IF HE COULD HELP
SOLVE THIS CASE,

30:46.770 --> 30:48.271
HE'D GET IN TROUT'S
GOOD GRACES

30:48.310 --> 30:50.130
AND BACK TO HIS OLD SELF,
YOU KNOW?

30:50.180 --> 30:50.908
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, JULES,
I'M NOT SURE

30:50.950 --> 30:53.441
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS.

30:53.480 --> 30:56.472
LASSIE'S. . . DYING.

30:56.520 --> 30:59.148
- HE'S WHAT?
- IT'S TERMINAL.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.088
WOULD YOU...
- OW.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.678
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

31:01.720 --> 31:03.779
- WELL, JUST THINK ABOUT
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.378
- OH, SURE,
HE'S BEEN ACTING WEIRD.

31:05.430 --> 31:06.624
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S DYING.

31:06.660 --> 31:08.719
- SHH.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.990
- NO, I AM TELLING YOU,
BUNNY-FACE:

31:11.030 --> 31:14.591
THIS IS THE END.
SIX, MAYBE EIGHT WEEKS, TOPS.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.790
- [gaSPSJ
- NO, DON'T CRY.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.035
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

31:19.070 --> 31:20.628
- OH, NO, HE'S DYING.
WELL, WHAT DO WE DO?

31:20.670 --> 31:22.535
WHAT IS IT?
- NOT ENTIRELY SURE.

31:22.580 --> 31:23.569
I MEAN, WE CHECKED HIS POCKETS
FOR QUARTERS.

31:23.610 --> 31:24.770
- AND HIS HEAD
FOR TEMPERATURE.

31:24.810 --> 31:26.448
- WE DID RULE OUT
PAC-MAN FEVER.

31:26.480 --> 31:28.016
- SHAWN, THIS IS SERIOUS.
- I KNOW.

31:28.050 --> 31:29.711
I CAN'T DEAL WITH DEATH.

31:29.750 --> 31:31.479
LOOK, HUMOR AND ATARI
ARE THE BEST MEDICINE

31:31.520 --> 31:32.748
FOR SITUATIONS
LIKE THIS, JULES.

31:32.790 --> 31:34.212
THAT'S JUST SCIENCE.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.581
- HE TOOK MY TICKET BOOK
AND MY PENS.

31:36.620 --> 31:39.726
YES, BOTH PENS.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.990
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
THEY GIVE YOU, SHMOOCHY PANTS.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.897
THEY GIVE YOU
SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS' SEVERANCE.

31:44.930 --> 31:46.488
[sighs]
I DON'T KNOW.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.066
MAYBE THIS IS ALL
FOR THE BEST.

31:48.100 --> 31:48.794
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
[beep]

31:48.840 --> 31:50.592
- HI.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.904
HEY, I'M HEADIN' DOWN
TO THE FISH MARKET

31:52.940 --> 31:55.101
WHERE OUR SUSPECT WORKS.

31:55.140 --> 31:58.473
YOU WANNA COME JUST TO HELP
GET YOUR MIND OFF THINGS

31:58.510 --> 32:00.444
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

32:00.480 --> 32:01.640
- HUH?
- YEAH.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.238
I THINK IT'D BE GOOD.

32:07.790 --> 32:09.257
- GUS, I GOTTA TELL YOU:

32:09.290 --> 32:10.712
YOUR MOM WAS PRETTY MUCH
AN OPEN BOOK

32:10.760 --> 32:11.920
AT OUR SESSION
THIS MORNING.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.552
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"OPEN BOOK"?

32:13.590 --> 32:16.525
- [laughs]
THAT'S COACH-CLIENT PRIVILEGE.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.994
- [sighs]
OH, GOD.

32:19.030 --> 32:22.534
- OH, CARLTON.

32:22.570 --> 32:24.834
- YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU?

32:24.870 --> 32:26.565
[sighs]

32:26.610 --> 32:29.477
DO HECKLE AND JECKLE
KNOW TOO?

32:29.510 --> 32:31.740
MAN.

32:31.780 --> 32:34.374
JUST TRY NOT TO LET IT
SPREAD AROUND THE STATION, OKAY?

32:34.420 --> 32:36.980
- [sniffles]
OKAY.

32:37.020 --> 32:38.612
OKAY, FRANK.

32:38.650 --> 32:39.947
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT TONY DELFIN?

32:39.990 --> 32:41.218
- WORKED THE GUARD GATE.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.251
HE WAS A TOP-SHELF D-BAG.

32:43.290 --> 32:44.826
- YEAH, BUT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME, RIGHT?

32:44.860 --> 32:46.680
HOPEFULLY?
- NO.

32:46.730 --> 32:48.459
HE HASN'T SHOWN UP FOR WORK
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.058
- [quietly]
SWEET.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.192
- BOB, THIS PART IS IMPORTANT.

32:51.230 --> 32:52.891
THIS PART IS SERIOUS.

32:52.930 --> 32:54.636
YOU HAVE WOOD
IN YOUR BEARD.

32:54.670 --> 32:56.160
ALL RIGHT, THE LAST "E"
IN S.E.I.Z.E.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.668
STANDS FOR "EIGHTIES."

32:58.710 --> 33:00.928
AND THAT PERTAINS TO YOU
IN A HUGE WAY

33:00.970 --> 33:03.734
BECAUSE I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE 19805.

33:03.780 --> 33:05.077
- THE GREATEST DECADE
OF ALL-TIME.

33:05.110 --> 33:07.203
- FASHION, REPUBLICANS.
- APOLLONIA, VANITY.

33:07.250 --> 33:08.808
- SO THE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND

33:08.850 --> 33:11.182
THIS STINK FARM
AND YOU'RE THINKING TO YOURSELF,

33:11.220 --> 33:16.817
"MY BEARD IS DELICIOUS
BUT MY LIFE IS HORRIBLE,"

33:16.860 --> 33:18.953
I WANT YOU TO GO
INTO THE ABSCESSES OF YOUR MIND

33:18.990 --> 33:20.582
AND THINK ABOUT THE '805,

33:20.630 --> 33:21.949
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND?

33:22.000 --> 33:25.629
YOU'RE GONNA FIND
HOT DOG ON A STICK.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.764
HOT DOG ON A STICK, MAN.

33:33.610 --> 33:37.330
- WE TRACED THE WHITE VAN
TO A TONY DELFIN.

33:39.150 --> 33:42.677
- MY GUT IS TELLING ME
WE NEED TO CHECK THE FISH GUTS.

33:48.020 --> 33:51.854
- I DON'T THINK TONY DELFIN
IS OUR MAN.

33:51.890 --> 33:54.950
- AND THERE IS OFFICIALLY
A RUTHLESS KILLER

33:55.000 --> 33:56.297
ON THE LOOSE, YOU GUYS.

33:56.330 --> 33:57.991
- NO.

33:58.030 --> 33:59.292
NO!

34:02.600 --> 34:03.635
- OKAY, SO WE'RE ALMOST POSITIVE
OUR VICTIMS

34:03.670 --> 34:05.206
WEREN'T CHOSEN AT RANDOM,

34:05.240 --> 34:06.434
BUT WE CAN'T SEEM
TO CONNECT THEM IN ANY WAY.

34:06.470 --> 34:08.734
- UH, THAT'S NOT TRUE, JULES.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.077
WE GOT CONFIRMATION
THAT TONY DELFIN

34:10.110 --> 34:11.839
IS ALSO AN A-HOLE.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.177
- WHICH MEANS OUR THEORY
ABOUT THE KILLER

34:13.210 --> 34:15.041
KNOCKING OFF A-HOLES
OR ASPIRING TO BE

34:15.080 --> 34:16.672
THE GRAND POOBAH OF A-HOLES
IS STILL ALIVE.

34:16.720 --> 34:17.846
- VERY MUCH SO.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.017
- THE ONLY THING
WE KNOW FOR SURE

34:19.050 --> 34:20.813
IS THAT OUR SUSPECT
KILLED TONY,

34:20.850 --> 34:22.556
STOLE HIS VAN, AND HAS BEEN
DRIVING THAT VEHICLE

34:22.590 --> 34:23.659
FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS.

34:23.690 --> 34:25.624
- MM.

34:27.230 --> 34:29.289
- OH, BUT THEY WON'T
LET ANYONE PASS.

34:29.330 --> 34:31.195
IT'S MY ANNIVERSARY.

34:31.230 --> 34:34.097
- CH EWBACCA-CCINO
FROM JAWA THE CUPP ON THE FLY.

34:34.140 --> 34:35.789
- I KNOW WHO OUR KILLER IS.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.831
I EVEN KNOW WHERE HE LIVES.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.632
BACK WHERE IT ALL BEGAN.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.671
- SUSPECT '5 NAME
IS PATRICK AUBASHAWN.

34:43.710 --> 34:45.769
HIS WIFE'S INSIDE, HASN'T SEEN
HER HUSBAND FOR TWO DAYS.

34:45.810 --> 34:49.610
- LET'S DO THIS.
- SHOULD WE WAIT FOR LASSIE?

34:49.650 --> 34:51.117
- IS THE SUSPECT INSIDE?

34:51.150 --> 34:53.641
- NO, CARLTON,
JUST HIS WIFE.

34:53.690 --> 34:58.081
- YOU SURE?
- PRETTY SURE, YEAH.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.728
- WELL, LIKE I SAID,
I KICKED PATRICK OUT

35:02.760 --> 35:04.899
A COUPLE DAYS AFTER HE MISSED
OUR ANNIVERSARY DINNER.

35:04.930 --> 35:06.761
HE TRIED TO MAKE UP
THIS TALL TALE

35:06.800 --> 35:09.598
ABOUT BEING ARRESTED
FOR STICKING UP FOR HIMSELF.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.164
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
THAT'S TRUE.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.270
- MARIE, I AM SENSING
THAT PATRICK

35:14.310 --> 35:16.528
HAD A SERIOUS PROBLEM
WITH ONE OF THE OTHER PATRONS

35:16.580 --> 35:17.672
AT JAWA THE CUPP?

35:17.710 --> 35:19.268
- YES, HE DID.

35:19.310 --> 35:21.141
THIS RICH JERK WOULD ALWAYS
CUT IN FRONT OF HIM

35:21.180 --> 35:23.740
TO ORDER
HIS CHEWBACCA-CCINO.

35:23.780 --> 35:26.089
- AND DID YOUR HUSBAND
HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH TONY,

35:26.120 --> 35:28.088
THE GUARD WHO WORKED
THE GATE AT THE FISH MARKET?

35:28.120 --> 35:30.782
- YEAH.
TONY WAS A REAL D-BAG.

35:30.820 --> 35:32.822
HE'D ALWAYS MAKE PATRICK
PARK IN THE GUEST LOT

35:32.860 --> 35:35.829
FOR NOT HAVING
HIS I.D. BADGE...

35:35.860 --> 35:37.691
EVEN THOUGH HE'S WORKED THERE
FOR TEN YEARS.

35:37.730 --> 35:39.891
AND BETWEEN TONY
AND THAT JERK-ASS

35:39.930 --> 35:41.534
AT THE COFFEE PLACE,

35:41.570 --> 35:43.390
PATRICK WAS ALWAYS LATE
FOR WORK.

35:43.440 --> 35:46.739
AND THEN, FINALLY,
A FEW DAYS AGO, HE GOT FIRED.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.271
I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

35:48.310 --> 35:51.006
BUT PATRICK JUST REFUSED
TO STICK UP FOR HIMSELF.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.974
I CAN'T BE MARRIED TO
AND HAVE KIDS WITH SOMEONE

35:53.010 --> 35:55.114
WHO'S SCARED
OF HIS OWN SHADOW.

35:55.150 --> 35:56.310
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

35:56.350 --> 35:58.910
- I SAID
I CAN'T BE MARRIED TO

35:58.950 --> 36:01.953
AND HAVE KIDS WITH SOMEONE
WHO'S SCARED OF HIS OWN SHADOW.

36:01.990 --> 36:03.548
- 'SCUSE ME.

36:06.590 --> 36:08.694
- IT'S OKAY.
HE'S DYING.

36:08.730 --> 36:10.391
- MARIE, WE HAVE REASON
TO BELIEVE

36:10.430 --> 36:13.263
THAT PATRICK MAY HAVE KILLED
THE JERK AT THE COFFEE SHOP,

36:13.300 --> 36:16.997
TONY, AND ATTEMPTED TO KILL
OUR CURRENT POLICE CHIEF.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.736
- WHAT?
WHY?

36:19.770 --> 36:22.238
- UH, BECAUSE THEY RUINED
HIS LIFE, IN A NUTSHELL.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.032
AND YOUR BOY
WENT ALL MIKEY DOUGLAS

36:24.080 --> 36:25.707
FROM FALLING DOWN,

36:25.750 --> 36:27.775
WHICH I SAW AGAIN RECENTLY,
BY THE WAY.

36:27.810 --> 36:30.142
HAIR WAS A BOLD CHOICE.
NO WAY AROUND THAT.

36:30.180 --> 36:34.219
BETWEEN THAT
AND GHOST IN THE DARKNESS,

36:34.260 --> 36:36.114
LOOKS LIKE
HE WENT TEMPORARILY...

36:36.160 --> 36:39.049
[suspenseful orchestration]

36:39.090 --> 36:47.225
*

36:59.610 --> 37:01.749
- YOU CAN DO THIS,
CARLTON.

37:01.780 --> 37:03.543
- WHY WOULD
HE DO THIS ALONE?

37:03.580 --> 37:05.138
- 'CAUSE HE'S TOAST, JULES.
HE'S MAN TOAST.

37:05.190 --> 37:06.839
- AND HE WANTS TO DIE
IN A MONSOON OF BULLETS.

37:06.890 --> 37:09.211
REMEMBER?
both: HAILSTORM.

37:40.850 --> 37:43.057
- WE MEET AGAIN.

37:43.090 --> 37:45.558
- PATRICK, RIGHT?
OKAY.

37:45.590 --> 37:47.057
LISTEN:

37:47.090 --> 37:50.093
I TOTALLY GET
THAT YOU ARE ON A RAMPAGE

37:50.130 --> 37:51.461
AGAINST ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT HAVE WRONGED YOU,

37:51.500 --> 37:54.367
BUT I AM NOT
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.096
- WELL, YOU ARE NOW.
- OKAY, JUST HEAR ME OUT, MAN.

37:57.140 --> 38:00.234
I AM IN BAD SHAPE
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

38:00.270 --> 38:02.306
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY.

38:02.340 --> 38:04.843
- I DON'T CARE.
SO MAKE YOUR MOVE,

38:04.880 --> 38:08.008
AND LET'S DO THIS.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.848
- PATRICK, I WOULD REALLY
RATHER NOT ENGAGE

38:10.880 --> 38:13.144
IN AN OLD-WEST-STYLE STANDOFF
AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT,

38:13.190 --> 38:14.657
ALL RIGHT?

38:14.690 --> 38:16.612
SEE, I HAVE KIND OF
A BIG DEAL

38:16.660 --> 38:18.321
HAPPENING IN EIGHT MONTHS,

38:18.360 --> 38:21.022
AND IT HAS
TOTALLY USURPED

38:21.060 --> 38:23.756
MY TYPICALLY UNBRIDLED LOVE
OF SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.997
SO...
- LASSIE'S NOT DYING.

38:27.030 --> 38:28.930
- HE'S NOT?
THEN WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:28.970 --> 38:30.790
- HE'S HAVING
A LITTLE LASSIE.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.239
- SEE, THE THING IS

38:32.270 --> 38:33.862
I'M GOING TO BE A FATHER,

38:33.910 --> 38:36.208
AND I'M SURE
YOU CAN APPRECIATE

38:36.240 --> 38:40.802
WHY I WOULD REALLY PREFER
THAT THIS END PEACEFULLY

38:40.850 --> 38:43.739
WITHOUT ANY GUNPLAY.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.155
- NO CAN DO.
- OKAY, OKAY, J-J-JUST HANG ON.

38:50.190 --> 38:51.623
HANG ON.

38:51.660 --> 38:53.480
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.828
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF A PROGRAM CALLED S.E.I.Z.E.?

38:55.860 --> 38:58.158
- GOOD BOY SAID...

38:58.200 --> 39:00.020
- YOU KNOW, I-I'M SURE

39:00.070 --> 39:01.992
YOUR KID'S LIFE WILL BE FINE
WITHOUT YOU AROUND.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.931
MY OLD MAN WASN'T AROUND,
AND LOOK AT ME.

39:05.970 --> 39:07.460
SO MAKE YOUR MOVE.

39:07.510 --> 39:09.137
- SO DID--DID YOU JUST SAY

39:09.180 --> 39:10.909
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME AWAY
FROM MY FAMILY?

39:10.940 --> 39:12.305
- YES.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.204
- WHAT KIND OF MAN
WOULD I BE

39:14.250 --> 39:15.842
IF I DIDN'T MAKE THE WORLD
A SAFER PLACE FOR MY SON?

39:15.880 --> 39:17.347
- I THINK I HAVE
TO GET IN THERE.

39:17.380 --> 39:19.143
- WAIT. I THINK LASSIE'S
GETTING HIS MOJO BACK.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.988
- HAVING A BABY
SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SCARED.

39:22.020 --> 39:24.784
IT SHOULD MAKE ME EVEN SHARPER
THAN I WAS BEFORE.

39:24.830 --> 39:29.028
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- THAT'S RIGHT, PAL.

39:29.060 --> 39:31.096
BECAUSE I'M
CARLTON "DANGER" LASSITER.

39:31.130 --> 39:33.291
YOU WANNA DRAW AGAINST ME?

39:33.330 --> 39:35.093
SAY WHEN.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.869
- [laughs]
WHAT?

39:36.900 --> 39:38.458
YOU'RE CRAZY, MAN.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.501
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU'RE A POLICEMAN.

39:40.540 --> 39:42.906
- NO.
I'M YOUR HUCKLEBERRY.

39:42.940 --> 39:45.807
- YOU'RE MY WHAT?
- SAY WHEN.

39:53.490 --> 39:56.789
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
KISS THE FLOOR NOW.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.127
[in Southern accent]
- DOC?

40:00.160 --> 40:02.196
HELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WAS BACK IN TOWN.

40:02.230 --> 40:04.198
THAT'S AWESOME.
[laughs]

40:04.230 --> 40:05.822
- I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY, CARLTON.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.565
AND CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE BABY.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.433
- I'M GONNA BE A PAPA.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.505
- [whistling]

40:17.540 --> 40:19.041
- ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOIN' IN.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.377
WHAT'S MY PLAY HERE?

40:20.410 --> 40:22.071
LAST LETTER
IN S.E.I.Z.E., RIGHT?

40:22.120 --> 40:24.042
- NAH, I BAILED
ON THAT WHOLE THING, MAN.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.843
ZEBRAS, AND EGGS,
AND I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER

40:25.890 --> 40:26.948
WHAT THE "I"
STOOD FOR.

40:26.990 --> 40:28.343
- I DON'T KNOW.
- EXACTLY.

40:28.390 --> 40:29.812
JUST GO IN THERE
AND BE YOURSELF.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.885
- ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT?

40:31.930 --> 40:35.252
- GO IN THERE
AND BE SOMEONE ELSE.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.791
GOOD LUCK.
WE'RE ALL COUNTING ON YOU.

40:37.830 --> 40:39.491
- [whistling]

40:42.470 --> 40:45.962
OFFICER LASSITER,
YOU DELIVERED.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.638
I WAS BETTING AGAINST YA
BECAUSE IT'S SATISFYING.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.739
BUT YOU PULLED IT OFF.

40:50.780 --> 40:52.270
AND FOR THAT,
YOU'RE GONNA BE REWARDED.

40:52.310 --> 40:54.517
- YOU MEAN I'M|\IIBOACK TO BEING--

40:54.550 --> 40:56.541
BUT IN MY CURRENT REVIEW
OF THE FINANCIAL BUDGET

40:56.580 --> 40:58.912
FOR THE CITY, I DISCOVERED
THERE'S SOME AVAILABLE FUNDS

40:58.950 --> 41:02.056
FOR A DEPARTMENT
ASSIGNED DRIVER.

41:02.090 --> 41:03.614
- YOUR DRIVER?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

41:03.660 --> 41:06.629
YOU'LL BE EXPECTED
TO DELIVER ME TO AND FROM

41:06.660 --> 41:09.356
ALL OF MY PERSONAL
AND BUSINESS-RELATED EVENTS.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.493
- WHEN DO I START?
- WELL, I AIN'T WALKING

41:11.530 --> 41:13.896
TO MY 7:30 SPIN CLASS,
NOW, AM I?

41:15.670 --> 41:17.365
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FEAR
OF DYING ANYMORE, HENRY.

41:17.400 --> 41:20.403
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

41:20.440 --> 41:24.479
AND MY LIFE IS OUT HERE
CHASING BAD GUYS.

41:24.510 --> 41:26.546
- CARLTON, I'VE MADE
MORE MISTAKES IN MY LIFE

41:26.580 --> 41:28.616
THAN I CARE TO ADMIT.
MY MARRIAGE WAS DOOMED.

41:28.650 --> 41:30.117
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY SON

41:30.150 --> 41:32.345
HAS BEEN ON LIFE SUPPORT
FAR TOO LONG.

41:32.390 --> 41:35.109
AND IT WAS ALL BECAUSE
OF MY LOVE FOR THE JOB.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.718
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS
TOO STUPID TO REALIZE?

41:36.760 --> 41:38.387
- WHAT?

41:38.420 --> 41:41.253
- THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
A BAD GUY TO CHASE.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.155
BUT YOUR KID, YOUR CHILD?

41:43.200 --> 41:45.259
THEY'RE ONLY GONNA
GROW UP ONCE.

41:45.300 --> 41:46.790
THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT YOU
LIKE YOU ARE

41:46.830 --> 41:49.162
THE GREATEST THING
IN THE WORLD ONLY FOR SO LONG.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.531
AND THINGS THAT ARE
GONNA HAPPEN IN THEIR LIFE

41:50.570 --> 41:53.698
ARE GONNA HAPPEN ONCE,
ONE TIME ONLY.

41:53.740 --> 41:57.039
AND THOSE ARE THE MEMORIES
YOU WANNA HOLD ON TO.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.139
MEMORIESN%F THE JOB?

41:59.180 --> 42:02.172
[chuckles]
THEY WON'T EVEN COME CLOSE.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.348
TRUST ME.

42:05.390 --> 42:07.142
- THANKS, HENRY.
I WON'T FORGET THIS.

42:07.190 --> 42:08.851
- ANYTIME.

42:09.920 --> 42:11.251
WHAT?

42:11.290 --> 42:13.019
YOU'RE STILL GIVING ME
A TICKET?

42:13.060 --> 42:14.482
- GOTTA DO IT.

42:14.530 --> 42:16.225
GOTTA FILL A QUOTA.

42:16.260 --> 42:18.820
WE SHOULD DO THIS
MORE OFTEN.

42:20.330 --> 42:23.561
AND GET THAT TAILLIGHT
FIXED ASAP, HENRY.
