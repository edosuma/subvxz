00:15.520 --> 00:19.274
As I was going up the stair

00:19.440 --> 00:21.351
I met a man who wasn't there

00:24.920 --> 00:27.957
He wasn't there again today

00:30.400 --> 00:34.029
I wish
I wish he'd go away

00:34.920 --> 00:37.036
Where did you learn that?

00:38.200 --> 00:40.430
Where did you learn that poem?

00:40.600 --> 00:42.830
I made it up.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.310
When I was a kid, I made it up.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.837
What else do you remember
from back then?

00:57.720 --> 01:01.076
Don't beat around the bush, doc.
Don't beat around the bush.

01:01.240 --> 01:06.075
Don't beat around the bush.
Don't beat around the bush, doc!

01:07.200 --> 01:11.432
Tell me what you remember
about your mother.

01:12.760 --> 01:14.193
I remember my mom.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.397
I remember my mom.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.391
I remember my mom was a whore.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.833
How long would she k eep you there?

01:35.800 --> 01:38.837
As long as she was busy.

01:52.200 --> 01:55.317
Do you understand
why you're talking with me now?

01:55.480 --> 01:56.993
You're supposed to be good with...

01:58.320 --> 01:59.309
...headaches.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.833
I need something more than aspirin.
Know what I mean?

02:04.000 --> 02:07.879
Do you remember the murders?

02:09.639 --> 02:11.631
I remember...

02:12.320 --> 02:15.790
...that Columbia is the capital
of South Carolina.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.792
I remember that...

02:30.160 --> 02:32.833
Are you the person
who murdered six residents...

02:33.000 --> 02:36.356
...of the Lak eworth Apartments
on May 10, 1998?

02:40.920 --> 02:43.070
That's my birthday.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.276
Who am I speaking to right now?

02:52.680 --> 02:55.274
What should I call you?

02:56.480 --> 02:59.597
Call me whatever you want.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.438
Gary?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.238
Gary?

03:13.800 --> 03:15.756
Gary, you awak e?

03:15.920 --> 03:19.276
Yes, Greg, as a matter of fact,
I am awake.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.158
I'm sorry to bother you at home...

03:21.320 --> 03:24.437
...but there's gonna be a midnight
hearing in the Rivers case.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.354
The defense found a notebook
misfiled in evidence, a diary.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.318
They argued to the state Supremes
that it was suppressed.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.832
What are you talking about?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.151
There's no media.
This all happened under the radar.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.629
The prisoner transport
left an hour ago from Ely.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.837
Left Ely? What do you mean?
What transport?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.719
The diary gave them an opening
to argue insanity again.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.190
They need Rivers present, so they
drugged him, put him on a transport.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.430
They're taking this scumbag
to a hearing...

03:51.600 --> 03:53.352
...the night before his execution.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.636
How the fuck did you let that happen?

04:00.120 --> 04:02.350
Would anyone lik e to play
another round?

04:03.680 --> 04:06.274
Let's get another puzzle,
Vanna. What do we have?

04:06.440 --> 04:08.749
- "Around the House" is the category.
- Buy a vowel.

04:08.920 --> 04:10.672
- Buy a vowel.
- Pick up that trip.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.830
- Buy a vowel, you idiot.
- I'd lik e to buy a v owel. An E.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.276
One E.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.716
- All right, 350 left.
- N.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.192
- Buy a vowel.
- Buy another v owel.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.191
- Yes!
- An I.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.353
- I'd lik e to solve.
- Sure.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.919
"Kibbles 'n Bits."

04:38.080 --> 04:40.674
She won't stop bleeding.
She won't stop bleeding.

04:40.840 --> 04:44.992
- Jesus. What happened?
- An accident. We had an accident.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.230
Rain and lightning
is moving into Elk o.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.676
Doppler Radar has pick ed up a
severe thunderstorm with lightning...

04:50.840 --> 04:53.149
...on its way from Pershing
and Lander counties.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.959
- We could get damaging winds...
- Four times 10 equals...

04:56.120 --> 04:57.348
Four times 10...

04:57.520 --> 05:01.513
Timothy, could you not do that now?
We' re trying to hear about the storm.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.150
- Sure you don't want me to drive?
- No.

05:05.320 --> 05:09.871
I' II get us to Anderson,
then you can take over after we eat.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.475
Turn into spin.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.789
Apply brakes with short, firm pumps.

05:19.960 --> 05:23.396
Check mirror and gauge indicator
and roll...

05:23.560 --> 05:27.109
...to a slow, smooth stop.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.271
You okay, honey? Timothy?

05:32.680 --> 05:35.752
Seat belts, seat belts, seat belts.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.232
- It's a shoe.
- What?

05:43.400 --> 05:45.595
It's a shoe!

06:02.360 --> 06:05.796
For he's a jolly good fellow

06:05.960 --> 06:10.397
For he's a jolly good fellow

06:10.560 --> 06:16.749
For he's a jolly good fellow

06:18.760 --> 06:24.949
Which nobody can deny

06:36.320 --> 06:38.038
Shit!

06:43.160 --> 06:47.392
- Why didn't we get a better spare?
- Do you know what radials cost, Alice?

06:47.560 --> 06:49.073
Honey, don't get defensive.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.676
Well, if the point is to put him,
Timothy, into the right school...

06:52.840 --> 06:55.070
...it's absurd to focus...
- George? George?

06:55.240 --> 06:57.674
...on replacement tires.
- What can I do to help?

06:57.840 --> 07:01.435
Nothing. I'm fine, but...

07:01.880 --> 07:03.871
...thank you.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.310
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Alice?

07:35.320 --> 07:39.711
Oh, my God! Alice?
What have you done?

07:40.640 --> 07:44.235
What have you done?
What have you done?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.917
Hi, Harry.
Where do I begin?

07:50.080 --> 07:52.992
I have walked off the set, okay?

07:53.160 --> 07:55.230
I know they' II say
that I am in breach...

07:55.400 --> 07:58.198
...but they clearly
did not read my deal.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.590
They had me at a Ramada...

08:04.280 --> 08:06.191
Oh, Jesus.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.148
I think I have a spare battery
in my bag.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.514
Excuse me?

08:10.680 --> 08:14.559
I have a spare battery in my bag
up front, next to you.

08:14.720 --> 08:19.953
- Any idea which one, Miss Suzanne?
- The Louis Vuitton duffel, right on top.

08:24.560 --> 08:25.879
I don't see anything...

08:26.040 --> 08:30.033
Just use your fucking eyes!
It's in the side pocket! Just look!

08:30.200 --> 08:31.394
Jesus!

08:39.760 --> 08:42.876
What have you done?
What have you done?

08:43.039 --> 08:46.271
No, fool! If you help him,
you assume responsibility.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.869
It is my responsibility.
Let go of me.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.551
Alice? Alice?

08:51.720 --> 08:53.836
What have you done?
What have you done?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.634
Let me take a look.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.918
The driver of every motor vehicle
involved in any manner of accident...

09:01.080 --> 09:04.755
...originating from the operation
of a vehicle shall, within 10 days...

09:04.920 --> 09:07.150
You got a towel or something
in the car?

09:07.320 --> 09:09.880
Okay. Come help me look.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.916
- Within 10 days of the accident...

09:13.080 --> 09:17.232
...if you are operating a vehicle
and it should, at any time, involve...

09:17.400 --> 09:21.473
- Stay here. Keep her dry.
- It's okay. It's okay, honey.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.755
- Open the door! We need the phone.
- No!

09:25.680 --> 09:27.432
Sweetheart, it's okay.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.238
Honey, it's okay.

09:31.800 --> 09:35.190
- Give me the goddamn phone!
- The phone is dead, all right?

09:35.360 --> 09:39.638
You're gonna be fine.
You' re gonna be okay.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.838
No!

10:08.480 --> 10:10.835
- She won't stop bleeding.
- Jesus. What happened?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.673
There was an accident.
May I please use your phone?

10:13.840 --> 10:16.752
- Please use your phone?
- Yeah, sure.

10:19.480 --> 10:23.075
Shit. I'm not getting a line.
It happens in the rain.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.389
The phone doesn't work.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.438
St. Jude's has 24-hour emergency,
30 miles east.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.515
Okay.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.550
You sit here, okay?

10:34.760 --> 10:37.718
Keep pressure on the wound.
I' II be back with an ambulance.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.153
What are you doing?

10:49.320 --> 10:52.437
Sorry. It's a step down
from the Ramada, but it' II have to do.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.511
I am not staying here.
Are you out of your mind?

10:54.680 --> 10:59.310
This is my car. You work for me.
Get those bags back in this car now!

11:00.800 --> 11:05.635
I understand the bleeding person
has a medical condition, but so do I.

11:05.800 --> 11:11.079
My lung walls have depleted cilia.
If I stay here, I could asphyxiate!

11:15.160 --> 11:18.675
No, please, please, please,
please, please, please.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.152
Please!

11:28.240 --> 11:29.514
Hey!

11:34.840 --> 11:36.478
Stop. Please, please.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.270
Hi. I'm sorry, my car is stuck.
Can I get a ride?

11:43.440 --> 11:45.158
Okay.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.436
You know you're going east.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.470
Hospital's this way.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.673
It's flooded.
I mean, it's a dead end.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.276
Yeah, well, if you don't mind,
I gotta try.

12:21.720 --> 12:25.030
Okay, that will be $30 cash, please.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.750
Didn't you use to be that actress?

12:35.400 --> 12:37.231
Yes.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.956
- Wow.
- Now, is that a nice room?

12:43.560 --> 12:48.236
Because though I am leaving soon,
I still would prefer a nice room.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.271
Your nicest...

12:53.440 --> 12:55.271
...if that is possible.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.916
Eight's very cozy.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.989
I tried to tell you.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.795
Hey! Hey, stop!
There's no way through.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.520
There's no way through!
No way through!

13:22.680 --> 13:24.079
- Lou, wake up.
- What?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.199
Cell phone.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.271
- What?
- Do you have a cell phone?

13:28.440 --> 13:29.793
Who wants to know?

13:30.440 --> 13:33.034
There's been an accident,
a bad one. A lady's hurt.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.953
- We need a cell phone right now.
- Dude, slow down.

13:36.120 --> 13:39.476
First, we don't know who you are.
Second, we don't see an accident...

13:39.640 --> 13:43.155
Listen to me, dude, I'm having a really
fucked-up, wet, bad fucking day.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.709
So if you have a cell phone,
give it to me now!

13:45.880 --> 13:51.079
Dude, we don't have a cell phone,
so could you just let go of me now?!

13:52.600 --> 13:55.239
I need you to give me a lift
in the other direction.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.836
It's flooded that way too.
It's worse than this.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.517
Ginny, pop the trunk.
Let them in.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.633
Let them in.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.957
Hey. How you doing?

14:30.440 --> 14:33.079
- Phone still dead?
- Yeah. Where's your Lincoln?

14:33.240 --> 14:36.676
Stuck in a run-off two miles down
the road. The other way's fucked too.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.751
The kids gave us a lift.
The girl was stranded.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.595
- Is there another way out?
- Is she a hooker?

14:41.760 --> 14:43.318
Hey! Is there a back road?

14:43.480 --> 14:45.914
Where do you think the water's going?
You wouldn't get 500 feet.

14:46.080 --> 14:49.550
- How's the woman?
- I don't know. They' re in number 4.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.078
I'm sorry. We don't rent rooms
by the hour.

15:08.920 --> 15:12.037
Funny. You still serving food?

15:12.200 --> 15:16.113
Vending machines are around
the corner. Go ahead.

15:16.280 --> 15:20.512
Rooms are 30 bucks in advance with
picture ID. You need one room or two?

15:20.680 --> 15:24.116
Excuse me. I was talking to you.
I'd appreciate it if you looked at me.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.269
Well, I don't like looking at trash.

15:34.280 --> 15:38.671
We' re a little stuck here, George.
I don't think we can get out tonight.

15:38.840 --> 15:43.356
- She just keeps shaking.
- She's in shock.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.829
- Let me take a look.
- What?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.434
Let me take a look.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.751
Did your wife pack a sewing kit?

16:07.280 --> 16:08.395
No.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.632
Are you the manager?

17:27.800 --> 17:29.711
Yeah.

17:30.200 --> 17:34.751
I'm Officer Rhodes, Corrections.
I'm transporting a prisoner here.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.718
The law gives you the right
to refuse us service...

17:37.880 --> 17:40.189
...but the roads are flooded.
I could use a room.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.636
- It's an emergency.
- You got a radio in that car?

17:43.800 --> 17:45.870
- Who's this?
- Limo driver, had an accident.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.077
I got a lady pretty banged up.
I could use an ambulance.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.959
Four-four-two requesting medical.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.714
Four-four-two requesting medical.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.519
Nothing. It's been like this
for the past hour.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.989
She's losing a lot of blood.
Got a first aid kit?

18:00.160 --> 18:01.479
Band-Aids, that's it.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.108
- How about a needle and thread?
- Maybe in the diner.

18:04.280 --> 18:08.637
I' II get it. Locked up.
Stay dry.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.314
I' II be back with your key.
I'll put you in 10.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.631
- Okay, thanks.
- What do you got back there?

18:14.800 --> 18:16.836
Prison transfer.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.197
Maybe when you get him situated,
come to 4 and look at the lady.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.477
- I could use a second opinion.
- Yeah, sure.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.719
Looks like you' re fucked.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.788
Shut up!

18:49.160 --> 18:51.754
- I wish I had beige.
- This is fine.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.195
Would have been better.

18:54.360 --> 18:57.033
I gotta get the officer situated.
Let me know if you need something.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.111
I'll be right back.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.753
Where did you learn to do that?

19:08.160 --> 19:10.833
Pretty much where you' re standing.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.875
Hey, is the...?

19:26.600 --> 19:29.398
The little boy, is he all right?

19:29.560 --> 19:31.915
He hasn't said a word
since the accident.

19:32.080 --> 19:36.437
No, no, no. He doesn't talk much
ever since the...

19:38.800 --> 19:41.109
I'm his stepfather.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.316
His father...

19:44.600 --> 19:46.989
Two years ago, he left.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.835
Little temper problem.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.116
Watch your step.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.273
The furniture's for shit.

20:16.440 --> 20:20.592
If you're fixing to cuff him to
something, the toilet's bolted down.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.557
Thank you so much
for your assistance.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.393
- It's a good idea. Come on.
- I got stripes

20:25.560 --> 20:29.758
Stripes around my shoulders
And these chains

20:29.920 --> 20:32.115
These chains
They're about to...

20:36.080 --> 20:37.752
Let's go look at that lady.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.235
- You get anyone?
- What?

20:44.640 --> 20:47.791
- Did you get through?
- No, not yet.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.398
Good stitch job.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.919
Pulse is shallow, but steady.
Keep her comfortable.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.469
We should take turns on the radio,
if that's all right.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.674
No, it's not. I can manage.

21:22.120 --> 21:25.078
You gonna arrest me, officer?

21:28.480 --> 21:30.357
What?

21:31.320 --> 21:34.630
How'd you do that?
How'd you know I was a cop?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.275
No shit.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.268
Cheetos for dinner, huh?

21:45.440 --> 21:48.876
- That don't seem right.
- You got a better idea?

21:49.040 --> 21:53.079
I worked mess in the service.
Maybe the diner's open. I could...

21:53.240 --> 21:56.118
You got change for a dollar?

21:56.640 --> 21:59.518
I don't know. Let me see.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.789
Here you go.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.038
You got a name?

22:15.320 --> 22:17.993
- Paris.
- Paris, huh?

22:18.160 --> 22:19.388
I' II get it.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.676
Never been.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.877
Well, you ain't going tonight.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.751
Please.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.514
Please be strong.

22:40.120 --> 22:43.795
You see, Timothy and I...

22:43.960 --> 22:46.190
...we need you.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.360
We need you so much.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.512
Lou?

23:49.960 --> 23:51.916
Lou?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.639
You need to tell them, Harry,
that I can't work, I can't perform...

24:24.800 --> 24:27.553
...I can't shine living
in an environment like that.

24:27.720 --> 24:31.952
No, it is not about the money.
It's about the working conditions.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.157
One bar.

25:04.760 --> 25:06.591
One bar.

25:06.800 --> 25:07.915
No bar.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.353
One bar.

25:10.520 --> 25:11.635
Two bars.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.715
Come on. Come on.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.038
Here we go.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.999
There you go. Come on.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.188
Goddamn desert wasteland!

25:36.760 --> 25:40.594
Oh, shit! I just had it.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.953
Holy fuck.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.949
- Jesus, Mother of God.
- Who is this?

29:48.120 --> 29:51.271
The woman I was driving.

29:54.040 --> 29:57.112
- What the hell are you doing?
- There's something in there.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.316
- Use this, man.
- Thanks.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.517
- Are you a cop?
- I was.

30:09.960 --> 30:13.111
- She was in Room 10?
- I am.

30:14.760 --> 30:18.639
- Where's your guy?
- Cuffed to a toilet.

30:28.280 --> 30:30.350
Son of a bitch.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.875
That was a fucking drive.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.753
- Gentlemen.
- Your Honor.

30:46.880 --> 30:50.429
Ready, Sharon? Alrighty.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.876
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada,
for the purposes of...

30:54.040 --> 30:59.433
Judge Taylor, sir, with due respect,
we should wait till my client arrives.

30:59.880 --> 31:03.668
- He has a right to be present.
- He has precious few rights.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.671
He's 24 hours from execution.

31:06.720 --> 31:09.598
But to demonstrate his
mental state, which is the purpose...

31:09.960 --> 31:11.757
His mental state?

31:12.280 --> 31:13.998
His mental state?

31:14.520 --> 31:18.354
Do you know what time it is?
You think I got time for bullshit?

31:18.520 --> 31:21.956
That the justices called me in the
middle of the night to review a case...

31:22.120 --> 31:26.352
...I already sat on, that I already
decided, may make you happy.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.511
But it pisses me off.

31:28.760 --> 31:32.469
When your boy gets here, do what you
want, but in the name of decency...

31:32.640 --> 31:35.108
...state your goddamn case!

31:36.880 --> 31:38.916
Yes, sir.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.036
Somebody get me
a cup of coffee, black.

31:46.480 --> 31:50.439
All right, everybody! Listen up!

31:51.360 --> 31:52.918
There was an incident tonight.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.116
That's police talk for,
"Someone's head got lopped off."

31:55.280 --> 31:56.599
Larry!

31:57.920 --> 32:00.832
- Caroline Suzanne was murdered.
- What?

32:01.000 --> 32:04.595
- Who's Caroline Suzanne?
- The actress I was driving.

32:04.760 --> 32:07.832
And where exactly did that happen?

32:08.000 --> 32:11.117
We don't know, because
we can't find the body.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.673
Not all of it anyway.

32:12.840 --> 32:17.709
- What do you mean, you can't find it?
- Stay calm. Everything will be all right.

32:17.880 --> 32:21.634
Officer Rhodes is outside.
He was transporting a convict.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.268
- Who escaped.
- What are you...?

32:25.360 --> 32:27.157
- Hold on.
- Running free!

32:27.320 --> 32:29.629
Will you shut the fuck
up so he can talk?

32:29.800 --> 32:32.633
This is my place, ho!
I'll say what I please!

32:32.800 --> 32:34.358
- It's safe here.
- It is not safe here!

32:34.520 --> 32:36.351
- There's a cop here.
- Yeah, two cops.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.112
Wait. You're a cop?

32:38.360 --> 32:43.639
- I was. Shut up, Larry!
- It's not safe here! I'm not staying...

32:44.080 --> 32:46.594
It's all right. It's okay.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.156
Nothing.

32:50.320 --> 32:53.392
- Is she okay?
- Ginny.

32:53.680 --> 32:57.673
Ginny, will you...?
Stop it. Don't do this right now.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.239
- What are you doing?
- Put your arm around your girlfriend.

33:01.400 --> 33:05.313
- Actually, she's my wife.
- Everybody just stay here.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.438
- Stay in this room.
- Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.159
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

33:10.320 --> 33:13.710
- I'm not.
- All right. Larry?

33:13.880 --> 33:15.233
- Come with us.
- Why?

33:15.480 --> 33:18.278
- You know the place.
- Here's what I know. I'm not a cop.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.908
I don't take orders from
a professional slut!

33:21.240 --> 33:24.118
- Fuck you!
- Listen. Just stay here, please.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.872
Keep everybody calm.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.072
He's not gonna get too far.
Not in this!

33:38.800 --> 33:40.711
Rhodes!

33:41.000 --> 33:42.513
What are we chasing here?

33:45.240 --> 33:47.959
Multiple homicide.

33:48.320 --> 33:51.630
I'll go around this way.
Meet you in back.

34:04.320 --> 34:07.232
Is that where you live
full-time? Las Vegas?

34:08.280 --> 34:11.476
- Used to.
- What's that supposed to mean?

34:13.199 --> 34:16.237
It means I don't live there anymore.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.594
Maine!

34:54.080 --> 34:57.629
We'll go see if we can use this one.
We'll go in here.

34:57.800 --> 35:01.190
Since that wasn't a successful
attempt, we'll go in here.

35:01.440 --> 35:05.831
I'll be right out here. It's okay.
I'm gonna stand guard.

35:06.040 --> 35:10.670
Not a worry. I'll be right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.353
See, his mother usually does this.

35:41.440 --> 35:46.116
Hey, Ginny. So how long
you two been married?

35:46.280 --> 35:50.034
About nine hours. It was
a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.278
Viva Las Vegas, huh, Gin?

35:53.240 --> 35:55.959
- We need to leave!
- I was just talking to her.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.429
Something's happening!
I need to get out of here!

35:58.600 --> 36:03.628
- Ginny! Ginny!
- You don't own me, Lou!

36:03.800 --> 36:05.995
I own what's inside you!
Half, at least.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.958
You don't own any part
of me or my baby!

36:09.120 --> 36:10.838
Then why did I marry you?

36:11.440 --> 36:15.797
- Don't slam the goddamn door on me!
- Hey! Hey!

36:15.960 --> 36:18.349
You guys, just calm down!

36:24.400 --> 36:28.598
We are not leaving.
There is no place else to go.

36:28.760 --> 36:32.594
There's a flood outside,
Ginny. Stop it! Stop it!

36:32.760 --> 36:35.513
I'm not pregnant!

36:39.480 --> 36:41.755
What did you just say?

36:44.440 --> 36:46.670
I lied.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.954
I'm not pregnant.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.997
What are you talking about?
I saw the test.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.431
Why would you do that to me?

37:03.240 --> 37:07.438
Because Alison saw you at
The Hawk with that fucking girl!

37:11.920 --> 37:15.435
- Ginny, what are we, like 15?
- Go away!

37:16.760 --> 37:18.990
Goddamn!

37:37.320 --> 37:40.437
- Open this goddamn door, Ginny!
- No!

37:40.600 --> 37:43.319
I haven't been to The Hawk
in over a fucking year.

37:43.480 --> 37:49.032
Alison is a stupid bitch-whore,
who likes fucking with your head.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.395
Open the damn door, Ginny.

37:51.640 --> 37:55.269
- Open the fucking door!
- Not until you calm down!

37:55.640 --> 37:59.315
I'm calm! I am very fucking calm!

38:08.600 --> 38:10.989
What are you doing?

38:13.920 --> 38:16.593
Lou?

38:30.280 --> 38:34.353
Ginny, open this damn door!
Open the door!

38:34.840 --> 38:37.513
- Open the door!
- Stop it, stop it!

38:38.600 --> 38:42.912
Ginny, damn it, open the door!
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny!

38:43.080 --> 38:45.389
Lou, please stop!

39:21.760 --> 39:24.069
Lou?

40:03.560 --> 40:07.792
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

40:07.960 --> 40:10.633
Help me! Somebody help me!

40:18.360 --> 40:20.590
Help me!

40:20.960 --> 40:24.270
Help me! Somebody help me!

40:24.680 --> 40:28.195
Is he in there? Is he in there?

40:29.720 --> 40:33.156
Ginny, are you okay?
What happened? What happened?

40:39.600 --> 40:42.512
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus Christ.

40:50.520 --> 40:53.478
Lou? Lou?

40:54.560 --> 40:56.596
What's going on?

42:15.920 --> 42:17.239
What the hell?

42:20.280 --> 42:22.032
Oh, shit!

42:24.200 --> 42:26.270
Come here!

42:40.320 --> 42:44.029
They caught him. They caught him.

42:51.840 --> 42:54.149
Why are we keeping him in here?

42:54.920 --> 42:57.957
- Where would you prefer, Larry?
- I don't know.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.760
I told you to stay in 3, didn't I?
Did I tell you that?

43:00.920 --> 43:05.471
They got in a fight! I tried to
get them to go back inside!

43:05.640 --> 43:08.279
Should we try the radio again?

43:08.600 --> 43:12.229
Larry, just stay here and watch him.

43:12.400 --> 43:15.790
- Go back and look after Ginny.
- Where are you going?

43:16.120 --> 43:18.680
Just do it, please.

43:19.520 --> 43:20.714
Ed?

43:24.320 --> 43:26.834
I don't know if I'm comfortable
with guard duty, per se.

43:27.480 --> 43:30.517
He's unconscious, Larry.
He's tied to a post.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.955
Timothy.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.711
Timothy.

44:05.880 --> 44:11.000
Alice? Oh, my God. Alice?

44:12.280 --> 44:14.510
I don't remember anything.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.708
We had an accident.

44:18.600 --> 44:21.034
George? Can you keep
an eye on Ginny for a minute?

44:21.320 --> 44:27.270
She's awake now. I have
to get some aspirin to help her.

44:28.560 --> 44:31.597
Darling, I gotta go get
something out of my room.

44:47.640 --> 44:50.359
- Shit!
- What's wrong, buddy?

44:51.000 --> 44:52.718
What do you got in the fridge?

44:53.560 --> 44:56.154
- You shut up.
- What's in there?

44:58.520 --> 45:01.034
What's in there?

45:01.200 --> 45:03.077
- What do you got in there?
- Shut up.

45:03.480 --> 45:05.232
What is it, huh?

45:05.400 --> 45:07.072
- Shut up.
- You can tell me.

45:07.360 --> 45:11.319
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I got a whopper myself.

45:29.880 --> 45:31.438
What are you doing?

45:31.840 --> 45:32.989
Motherfucker!

45:33.160 --> 45:36.835
- What are you doing out here?
- Getting shit that's mine.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.470
What are you doing?
What, I don't get to ask a question?

45:40.640 --> 45:43.916
I'm taking photos. There's been two
murders. Before all the evidence...

45:44.080 --> 45:48.039
That's not an answer. You're a limo
driver. What are you doing?

45:48.200 --> 45:51.954
Looking to win some " beyond the call
of duty," limo-driver merit badge?

45:52.120 --> 45:55.317
You're not on the job anymore.
You don't need to be a hero.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.710
There's a real, live,
active-duty cop outside...

45:57.880 --> 46:00.599
The one who's managed to lose
a convicted killer?

46:03.040 --> 46:04.758
You're a complicated cat, Edward.

46:05.840 --> 46:08.115
No. Not really.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.670
I think so.

46:12.840 --> 46:15.149
What month were you born?

46:15.680 --> 46:18.478
- May.
- Taurus.

46:19.480 --> 46:21.232
Same as me.

46:24.400 --> 46:27.915
- Where were you a cop?
- Los Angeles.

46:28.440 --> 46:31.477
Were you fired or did you quit?

46:31.840 --> 46:34.035
I took medical leave.

46:34.520 --> 46:37.193
It was making me sick.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.432
I burned out, I guess.
Wasn't up for it.

46:45.400 --> 46:47.516
One day I got a call...

46:49.800 --> 46:52.030
...for a jumper.

46:52.200 --> 46:54.077
A young Mexican girl.

46:56.520 --> 46:59.830
Pregnant, infected with AIDS,
totally strung-out.

47:00.440 --> 47:03.830
She was truly one of the doomed.

47:06.760 --> 47:10.514
I asked her to come in off
the ledge and into my arms.

47:11.040 --> 47:13.952
She asked me why
she should bother living.

47:20.120 --> 47:22.315
What did you say?

47:24.320 --> 47:26.993
I was trained
to tell her lots of things.

47:27.160 --> 47:30.311
Her dreams, all the people
who'd miss her.

47:31.160 --> 47:33.913
But for a second, I hesitated.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.991
And she saw it.

47:40.080 --> 47:45.359
Within that second, I couldn't think of
one optimistic thing to say to her.

47:48.960 --> 47:52.032
So she spread her arms
and jumped.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.235
I started getting headaches...

48:01.440 --> 48:04.477
...and eventually started blacking out.

48:05.680 --> 48:09.878
So I filed for medical.

48:25.080 --> 48:27.116
What?

48:29.320 --> 48:30.992
What is it?

48:35.160 --> 48:36.912
Rhodes!

48:37.080 --> 48:41.949
- It's worse. Nothing but static!
- Where's that key from the actress?

48:43.360 --> 48:45.555
This was on the kid.

48:47.160 --> 48:49.833
- What is it, some kind of countdown?
- Larry!

48:52.280 --> 48:55.716
What the fuck is he doing?
Larry, come over here!

48:56.320 --> 48:59.949
Come over here, man.
What are you doing? Come over here.

49:01.320 --> 49:04.278
- What are you doing?
- I just went to get something.

49:05.200 --> 49:08.749
We told you to watch the guy.
What are you doing in your office?

49:09.520 --> 49:10.919
I just went to get something.

49:11.080 --> 49:14.675
How many sets of keys are there
to this place? Look at me. How many?

49:14.840 --> 49:17.149
- Two and a master set.
- Oh, my fucking God!

49:17.960 --> 49:24.115
Larry, you mother...! You son of a...!
Get the fuck in here! Get in here!

49:26.040 --> 49:28.554
Why did you kill him?
Why did you kill my con?

49:28.720 --> 49:33.396
Holy shit! Who did that?
Jesus Christ, I didn't do that!

49:33.560 --> 49:35.118
Bullshit! You're lying!

49:35.280 --> 49:38.989
- It's your bat sticking out of his throat!
- I know, but I didn't do it!

49:39.160 --> 49:40.832
Check the doors!

49:41.000 --> 49:42.558
- I didn't do it!
- Look at him!

49:42.720 --> 49:45.837
- Why'd you kill him?
- Why were you outside?

49:46.000 --> 49:47.956
- Why'd you leave him?
- I was scared.

49:48.120 --> 49:50.236
- What were you scared of?
- You wouldn't understand.

49:50.400 --> 49:51.799
Try me.

49:51.960 --> 49:53.678
- Why'd you kill my con?
- I didn't!

49:53.840 --> 49:57.549
I don't know how...
I went to my office, that's all!

49:57.720 --> 50:00.280
- Why'd you leave him?
- This your key? Number 8?

50:00.440 --> 50:03.000
Ten, nine, eight, huh?
This is your key!

50:03.160 --> 50:05.037
You can't say that!
Those aren't my keys!

50:05.200 --> 50:08.033
That's like leading the witness
or something. Look.

50:08.200 --> 50:11.749
These are my keys, okay?
These are my keys. You see?

50:13.240 --> 50:15.470
You got a Gucci wallet?
It's the actress's.

50:15.640 --> 50:19.872
Yes, I took her wallet.
Afterwards. After she died!

50:20.040 --> 50:25.239
Afterwards, all right? I didn't kill her.
And I didn't kill him.

50:25.400 --> 50:29.951
- Let her go, Larry.
- Get back! You won't pin this on me.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.076
- Timothy?
- Get him out of here!

50:32.240 --> 50:35.471
- Put it down.
- I didn't hurt anybody. No one!

50:35.640 --> 50:38.837
But I don't like cheap fucking whores!
If you take one more step...

50:39.000 --> 50:41.230
Fuck!

50:49.080 --> 50:50.991
Get it off!

50:54.680 --> 50:55.749
Shit!

51:03.400 --> 51:06.039
Come on, you little bitch.
Please fucking start.

51:06.600 --> 51:09.239
- Goddamn it!
- Hey!

51:10.120 --> 51:12.270
Larry, stop!

51:15.400 --> 51:16.719
What is going on?

51:17.240 --> 51:19.470
- Larry!
- Get out of my way, I didn't do shit!

51:22.680 --> 51:25.240
Timothy! Timothy!

51:46.840 --> 51:49.070
An insanity plea was
refused by the court...

51:49.240 --> 51:53.552
...despite the fact that my client
is a certifiable Axis IV dissociative.

51:53.720 --> 51:58.191
To this day, he remains unaware of
the crimes for which he was convicted.

51:58.360 --> 52:03.912
In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled
decisively that states cannot execute...

52:04.080 --> 52:07.197
...a person who does not understand
why he's being put to death.

52:07.360 --> 52:08.588
He signed a confession.

52:08.760 --> 52:12.150
- He didn't just sign it, he dictated it.
- Thirdly...

52:12.320 --> 52:17.599
...Malcolm's diaries found
misfiled in state evidence.

52:17.760 --> 52:22.515
Your Honor, this notebook contains
entries made just before the murders.

52:22.680 --> 52:26.832
Important to note are the spectacular
changes in handwriting style...

52:27.000 --> 52:28.718
...tone, point of view.

52:28.880 --> 52:33.510
What you are looking at are the private
thoughts of several different people.

52:33.680 --> 52:37.275
With permission,
Dr. Mallick will elaborate.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.795
Thank you.

52:40.120 --> 52:43.669
Your Honor, there is no
universally efficacious treatment...

52:43.840 --> 52:46.559
...for Dissociative Identity Disorder.

52:46.720 --> 52:50.838
In theory, one attempts to move
the patient towards integration.

52:51.000 --> 52:55.391
- A folding of their fractured psyche.
- Your Honor?

52:55.800 --> 52:57.199
He's here.

53:13.880 --> 53:16.440
No! What you saw was an accident!

53:16.600 --> 53:18.670
He ran out in front of me!
I'm not a murderer!

53:18.840 --> 53:20.831
There's a dead body
in your freezer, Larry.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.434
- I didn't kill him. I found him like that.
- Stop it!

53:23.600 --> 53:26.956
Listen! Listen! I was in Vegas last
month and I lost everything, okay?

53:27.120 --> 53:28.269
Everything!

53:28.440 --> 53:31.955
I drove west. I didn't know where
to go, but I was running on empty...

53:32.120 --> 53:34.429
...so I pulled in here at this place.

53:34.600 --> 53:38.752
And there was no one at the station,
so I came over to the office...

53:38.920 --> 53:40.638
...and I walked in.

53:40.800 --> 53:43.553
And there, sitting at that desk
right there, was the manager...

53:43.720 --> 53:46.280
...facedown in a Banquet Potpie.
Dead!

53:46.440 --> 53:49.591
- Heart attack or something.
- Banquet Potpie!

53:49.760 --> 53:52.228
He'd been sitting there
for God knows how long.

53:52.400 --> 53:56.279
All of a sudden, this auto-parts
salesman pulls up, looking for a room.

53:56.440 --> 53:58.590
I didn't have a fucking dime...

53:58.760 --> 54:01.228
...so I took his 30 and gave him one.

54:01.400 --> 54:05.552
I just took the key from the wall
and gave him a room.

54:05.720 --> 54:09.838
Maybe that was wrong,
but I was broke, and that's what I did.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.751
Then I came back in here...

54:13.320 --> 54:16.756
...and I moved Larry's body...
His name was Larry too.

54:16.920 --> 54:20.435
I put him in the freezer.

54:22.920 --> 54:25.559
I wasn't trying to hide him.
It was hot out.

54:25.720 --> 54:30.111
I thought it was the best place for him
till his family or someone came along.

54:30.280 --> 54:32.714
Only no one did...

54:33.160 --> 54:35.799
...except more guests.

54:35.960 --> 54:38.713
So I checked them in too.

54:39.600 --> 54:41.989
And they all seemed happy...

54:42.160 --> 54:44.720
...so I just stayed.

54:45.720 --> 54:48.757
Cry me a river.
This is a total crock of shit!

54:48.920 --> 54:51.229
- No, it's not!
- Admit it, you killed him!

54:51.400 --> 54:54.039
Just like you killed my con.
Just like you killed her husband.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.760
Just like you killed his actress.
Just admit it.

54:56.920 --> 55:00.435
- Say it, "I killed them."
- Stop it! He can't take any more!

55:00.600 --> 55:04.036
Everything is okay now. Everything
is fine. We got the guy. It's fine.

55:04.200 --> 55:05.872
- I don't know what we got.
- What?

55:06.040 --> 55:08.395
We thought we got the guy
two hours ago, then...

55:08.560 --> 55:10.835
You believe this shit?
It's him! It's this guy!

55:11.000 --> 55:13.036
He had a knife to your neck,
remember?

55:14.160 --> 55:17.197
His story's so unbelievable,
I think it just might be true.

55:17.960 --> 55:19.313
She's got a point.

55:22.200 --> 55:24.270
You guys are crazy.

55:24.480 --> 55:26.630
Maybe it's the burial ground.

55:28.440 --> 55:29.555
What?

55:31.160 --> 55:35.153
Read the brochure in there.
It's all around us.

55:35.320 --> 55:38.312
A hundred years ago, the government
moved these Indians here.

55:38.480 --> 55:41.552
They all died
because there was no water.

55:43.560 --> 55:45.869
Now they're coming back to life
like sea monkeys, huh?

55:46.040 --> 55:47.917
Come on.
Give me a break, sweetheart.

55:48.080 --> 55:50.310
- Just take it easy, Rhodes.
- You know, you take it easy!

55:50.480 --> 55:54.029
You've tried to run this show all night.
Giving orders, pointing fingers!

55:54.200 --> 55:57.078
You blamed my con for everything,
and he ends up dead.

55:57.240 --> 56:00.118
I'm telling you, it's him!
We all saw him run down George.

56:00.280 --> 56:03.636
Your actress's wallet is right there.
She's dead, there's the wallet.

56:03.800 --> 56:06.519
- What more do you want?
- Stop it! Please shut up!

56:07.560 --> 56:10.552
All right. You want a plan?
Here's the plan, okay?

56:10.720 --> 56:14.793
No one's gonna move. We'll stay
here, like this, in this room until dawn.

56:14.960 --> 56:17.030
No one leaves, no one moves.

56:17.200 --> 56:20.033
And if he tries anything,
I'm gonna shoot him!

56:20.200 --> 56:23.272
And if something out there
comes in here, I'll shoot it!

56:23.440 --> 56:26.193
And if anyone of us tries anything,
I'll shoot them!

56:26.360 --> 56:27.793
- We get it.
- Good!

57:00.240 --> 57:02.595
Timmy? Timmy?

57:02.760 --> 57:05.832
- You need to stay in here with us.
- It's all right.

57:12.280 --> 57:15.431
Remember that movie where
the 10 strangers went to an island...

57:15.600 --> 57:17.875
...and then they all died
one by one...

57:18.040 --> 57:22.238
...and then it turned out they weren't
strangers, they all had a connection?

57:22.400 --> 57:24.550
They all messed with the wrong guy,
and he was getting revenge.

57:24.720 --> 57:26.039
Shut up!

57:27.720 --> 57:30.678
I'm just saying maybe there's
a connection between all of us.

57:31.080 --> 57:32.354
Like what?

57:32.920 --> 57:35.798
- We're all in Nevada.
- Shut up!

57:38.360 --> 57:41.432
Where were you going with your con
when you pulled in here?

57:43.160 --> 57:46.436
Carson City. Okay?

57:47.880 --> 57:51.793
I was going home to Florida.
Where were you going?

57:51.960 --> 57:53.712
I was taking the actress to L.A.

57:54.080 --> 57:55.559
I was born in Florida.

57:56.600 --> 57:59.239
Since you been in that chair,
no one's died, so shut up!

57:59.400 --> 58:00.753
No one's died since we've
all been here!

58:00.920 --> 58:03.798
- Hey, sweetie, sit down.
- Where in Florida, Larry?

58:05.880 --> 58:09.156
- Where in Florida?
- Friends now, huh? Great.

58:10.360 --> 58:13.557
- Polk County.
- That's where I was born.

58:13.720 --> 58:15.950
- Which town?
- Mulberry.

58:16.120 --> 58:19.271
- Frostproof.
- No wonder you left.

58:19.600 --> 58:21.591
There's a town called Frostproof?

58:21.960 --> 58:25.714
They grow oranges.
The name doubles as a slogan.

58:25.880 --> 58:29.509
I danced hallelujah the day I left Polk.
Why would you wanna go back?

58:29.680 --> 58:32.513
I found a grove for sale
on the Internet.

58:32.680 --> 58:35.877
Nine acres, 1200 trees.
Limes and oranges.

58:36.600 --> 58:40.036
According to the realtor, the soil
needs a few tills, phosphorous...

58:40.200 --> 58:46.355
...lanes need reeding,
but it's real good land.

58:50.200 --> 58:51.952
What?

58:52.600 --> 58:54.511
It sounds nice.

59:14.280 --> 59:15.429
Ed?

59:18.800 --> 59:20.916
She's dead.

59:39.680 --> 59:42.035
Get him out of here.

59:42.840 --> 59:45.718
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.

59:52.200 --> 59:54.509
Look at this.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.996
- Where'd you get that?
- Right here.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:11.153
This doesn't make any sense.
She died from an accident.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:15.632
George was an accident,
if you believe Larry.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.755
Where is seven?

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.271
Back it up!

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.516
- See, I told you it wasn't me!
- That's not possible.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.593
I was standing right there. I saw what
happened. We all saw what happened.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.150
He ran out. Nobody could have
known he was gonna do that.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.548
No one human.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.109
We're back to that again?
It's the spirits, huh?

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.159
Maybe it's the ghost of the guy
that Larry put in the freezer.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.871
Somebody untie me.
Goddamn it!

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.678
You know it wasn't me.
Come on.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.671
- Listen.
- We gotta get out...

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.990
Take her car and get out.
You, her and the kid.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.309
There's nowhere to go.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.436
- How much gas do you have?
- Half a tank.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.636
You can drive till dawn on that.
Look at me.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.360
When you get to where it's flooded,
go the other way.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.794
I don't know if I can.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.952
Get the kid and go.
Right now. Come on.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.109
Timmy.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.794
Timmy, come on. Let's go.
Get up.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.075
What's going on?

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.878
- They can't leave!
- This way.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.951
We'll see you
when the storm breaks.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.317
Hey! Hey! They can't leave!
Where are they going? Get back here!

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.993
Go, go, go!
They're leaving.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.479
- They're not leaving.
- Go!

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.234
You can't let suspects leave
after four people have been killed!

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.233
- You really think they're suspects?
- They're not leaving!

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.159
Shit.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.437
Ginny!

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.993
Extinguishers.
Larry, you got a fire extinguisher?

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.715
- Fire extinguisher! Where?
- Back there!

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.717
Nobody in there.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.758
Maybe it got so hot,
they got cremated.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.911
There'd be something left.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.319
You did this.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.957
You did this!
You told them to get into the car!

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.519
Are you happy?

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.750
Where is he?

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:30.835
Nothing.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.990
I give up!

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.514
I give up!
What the hell do you want?

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.832
What do you want, you sick bastard?
What the fuck do you want from us?

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.995
I am turning 30 next week
and I just want to go home...

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.832
...and grow oranges!

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.034
It's your birthday next week?

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.998
It's my birthday next week.
The 10th.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.754
Me too.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.113
Me too.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.518
Yeah.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.154
George York, May 10.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.151
Alice York, May 10.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.072
Caroline Suzanne, May 10.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.514
Ginny and Lou Isiana, May 10.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.989
Me, Larry Washington,
May fucking 10.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.713
What are the odds?
Must be 10 trillion-to-one.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.429
What is it?

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.548
- Where's the fuse box, Larry?
- Other side of the building.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.351
Ginny and Lou Isiana.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.633
Virginia and Louisiana.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.916
Caroline, Carolina.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.631
Paris Nevada.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.358
George York.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.589
Larry Washington.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.553
Rhodes, Rhode Island.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.348
Ed Dakota.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:51.158
When I was going up the stairs
I met a man who wasn't there

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.595
He wasn't there again today

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.557
I wish
I wish he'd go away

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.231
Who is this?

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.233
Who am I speaking to right now?

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.996
Where did you learn that poem?

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.469
Who am I speaking to?
Look at me.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:11.790
Who am I speaking to right now?

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.309
Doc?

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.595
- Edward?
- What's happening?

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.480
- Please be quiet.
- He can hear what we're saying?

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.035
Of course I can hear
what you're fucking saying.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:35.069
Edward, you missed your last
appointment. Where have you been?

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.311
- Did I black out again?
- Try and think back.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.835
Where have you been?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.560
All right.
I was driving this actress...

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:50.989
...and we got stuck at the motel.
There was a storm.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.440
We couldn't get out
because of the storm.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.670
What happened at the motel?

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.039
People started dying.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.078
And then their bodies...
It didn't make any sense.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.912
They disappeared.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.920
Edward, I'd like to show
something to you, if I may.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.309
Do you recognize this man?

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.513
No.

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.879
That man, Edward,
is Malcolm Rivers.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.475
He's had a very troubled life.
He was arrested four years ago...

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.871
...and convicted of the murder
of six people in a violent rampage.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:35.470
- He did this.
- Detective, please.

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.198
Edward, listen to me.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:43.237
When faced with an intense trauma,
a child's mind may fracture...

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:46.836
...creating disassociated identities.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.876
That's exactly what happened
to Malcolm Rivers.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.349
He developed a condition
that is commonly known...

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.273
...as Multiple Personality Syndrome.

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:03.151
Why are you telling me this?

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:06.550
Because you, Edward...

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.712
...are one of his personalities.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.598
What?

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.711
Jesus Christ! What the fuck
did you do to my face?

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.518
- Keep calm.
- Where is my face?

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.069
- That is your face.
- Why am I tied up?

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.752
- Keep calm.
- Where is...?

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.399
- Please.
- Jesus Christ!

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.630
- Where is my face?
- Stay calm.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.349
No! I'm not gonna stay calm!
Why am I tied up like this?

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.830
Who are all these people?
What happened at the motel?

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.912
- Where is everybody?
- They don't exist, Edward.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.548
You were all created
by Malcolm as a child.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.029
- You're a liar!
- Consider what you know.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.430
- Everyone named after a state.
- No.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.956
Everyone sharing the same birthday.
Your blackouts.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.519
No! I was a cop!

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:09.229
I was a cop in the Rampart Division
of L.A.P.D. For six years.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.389
Edward, please.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.869
I live in Hollywood,
in a studio apartment.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.315
- You don't live there.
- I do live there!

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.232
You don't live anywhere.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.473
I know this is difficult to accept,
but the face you saw in that mirror...

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:26.714
...is the face I've always seen when
I talk to Edward or Paris or Larry...

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.757
...or anyone else you've met tonight.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:32.674
Malcolm is in the midst
of a medical treatment.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:38.198
One which forces all his identities to
confront one another for the first time.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.749
I knew there would be violence...

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:45.948
...and with it, the number
of the identities would be reduced.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.031
Reduced?

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.873
One of the personalities
you've met tonight, Edward...

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.793
...committed those murders
four years ago.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.789
He took control of Malcolm's body,
as you have now...

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.909
...and released an unspeakable rage.
And in 19 hours...

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.516
...Malcolm Rivers will be put to death
because of those actions...

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.389
...unless I can convince that man...

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.835
...that the killer is gone.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.309
I need you to stay with me.
Edward?

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.631
I need your help.
I need your help to finish this.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.872
Edward, listen to me.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.718
Edward, stay with me.

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.633
Listen to me.
I need you to understand.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.837
The killer cannot survive.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.194
Edward!

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.759
Got it?

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.196
I can't see a thing.
Is there a flashlight?

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.918
Hang on. Hang on.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.995
- You got a flashlight?
- Yeah, yeah, it's dead. Goddamn it.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.353
Shut up!

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.873
Hey. What am I
supposed to wear, man?

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.871
You're in it.

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.109
Larry.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.115
Larry, come here.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.799
Ed!

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.711
Ed!

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.277
Larry!

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.878
- Larry!
- Paris.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.909
Paris.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.398
Larry?

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.198
Larry? Larry?

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.799
Where are the keys to the truck?

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.996
Where are the keys to the truck?

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.997
- That was good, Larry.
- We gotta get out of here.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.072
- Ed has the keys to the truck.
- I got a spare right here.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.073
- Where is he?
- I don't know. Here.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.838
- What are you doing?
- We need a gun.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:44.955
Holy shit!

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.197
Give me the keys to the truck.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.398
Ed!

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.357
We gotta get out of here!

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.715
- Paris...
- He's coming. He's...

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.110
- Stay here.
- What's wrong with you?

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.919
Paris, listen to me.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.389
Stay here.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.636
It's gonna be okay.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.678
Throw me the keys to the truck, Ed.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.156
Throw me the keys to the truck.
Stay there. Stay there!

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.035
Ed! Ed! Ed!

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.435
Ed, let me see.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.238
We gotta get you to a hospital.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.436
We're gonna get you
to a hospital, okay?

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.353
Stay with me because
I'm gonna get you to the truck.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:30.035
Put your arm around my neck.
You gotta hold on, okay?

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:35.638
You with me, Ed? Stay with me.
Okay. One, two, three.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:40.792
You gotta help me get you up.
Ed, you gotta push a little bit.

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.877
Ed, why won't you let me help you?

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.912
Where did you go before?

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.709
What did you see?
Tell me what you saw.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.028
I saw you.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.076
I saw you in an orange grove.

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:36.439
Why won't you let me help you?

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.790
Where did you go?

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.951
What did you see?

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.355
I saw you...

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.237
...in an orange grove.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:31.994
The question, Your Honor, is whether
to convict the body or the mind.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:36.036
His body committed these murders,
that is true.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.350
The person who remains
inside did not.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.033
Judge Taylor, that may not be true...

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.589
We witnessed the destruction
of 10 identities tonight.

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.398
Nine were innocent
and one was guilty.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.549
They're not real!

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.950
The violence that existed in him
has been executed.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:52.591
Your Honor, Malcolm belongs
in a state hospital.

01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:01.390
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada, it is
the recommendation of this court...

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:04.120
...that Mr. Rivers' execution
be stayed.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:07.955
I am transferring Mr. Rivers
to state psychiatric services...

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:11.153
...under the care of Dr. Mallick.
