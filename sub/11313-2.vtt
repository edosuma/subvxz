00:10.546 --> 00:11.778
Nobody's at rest here.

00:11.780 --> 00:13.848
The living aren't. The dead aren't.

00:13.850 --> 00:17.686
One evening, two hands
grabbed me real hard. Bam!

00:17.688 --> 00:19.757
All I heard was, "He is a murderer."

00:20.891 --> 00:23.892
She just got attacked.

00:23.894 --> 00:26.960
He tells me they should get out
of here as quick as possible.

00:26.962 --> 00:29.663
I feel like this is
coming straight from Hell.

00:29.665 --> 00:34.303
Unfortunately, this
is not a happy place.

00:34.803 --> 00:37.138
I just hear death.

00:37.140 --> 00:38.739
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.472
God.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.608
It's like, "I'm going to get you."

00:42.610 --> 00:43.709
I see dead people.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.910
Her face was all demonic.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.645
I speak to dead people.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.347
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

00:49.349 --> 00:50.916
And they speak to me.

00:50.918 --> 00:52.417
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

00:52.419 --> 00:55.487
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.422
Something happened. Bam, bam, bam!

00:57.424 --> 00:59.057
I rely on my partner.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.559
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.361
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.795
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

01:03.797 --> 01:07.065
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.066
They're everywhere.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.636
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.638 --> 01:11.804
This guy's got the
markings of a serial killer.

01:11.806 --> 01:14.506
But Steve and I never speak...

01:14.508 --> 01:16.642
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.709
...until the very end...

01:17.711 --> 01:19.477
Is this dead guy doing that to her?

01:19.479 --> 01:21.212
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:21.214 --> 01:23.214
That's it.

01:23.216 --> 01:24.651
...or time to get out.

01:24.653 --> 01:29.056
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.306
I'm in the small town
of Gates, North Carolina.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.908
It's about an hour
south of Virginia Beach.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.577
I got a call from a woman
who was in hysterics.

01:52.579 --> 01:54.946
She says she has a
17-year-old daughter

01:54.948 --> 01:56.414
whose life is in danger,

01:56.416 --> 01:59.084
and she has absolutely no
idea how to protect her.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.887
She sounded horrible on the phone.

02:00.889 --> 02:02.221
She broke my heart

02:02.223 --> 02:04.758
and said Amy and I are her last hope.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.666
Before Amy arrives,

02:13.668 --> 02:15.168
I have to clear the area

02:15.170 --> 02:18.006
of anything that could
influence her findings.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.542
Spiritual items, photographs,
and religious texts

02:23.544 --> 02:26.412
have to be covered or removed.

02:26.414 --> 02:29.484
When I'm finished,
tonight's walk can begin.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.462
There's some problems here.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.597
There's a lot of anger here.

02:45.599 --> 02:49.734
The living here, I just
feel like this anger,

02:49.736 --> 02:54.175
it's really deconstructing their lives.

02:56.009 --> 03:00.114
This place is not good.
It makes me feel horrible.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.484
Some of the living here

03:05.486 --> 03:07.787
don't know what's real and what's not.

03:07.789 --> 03:10.789
Was that a dream or
not? Am I awake or not?

03:10.791 --> 03:13.559
Did I see that or not?
Nothing makes sense.

03:13.561 --> 03:16.394
I don't like it. It makes my head spin.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.464
Oy.

03:18.466 --> 03:21.469
I literally feel like I'm spinning.

03:32.279 --> 03:33.880
So, Deborah, I'm glad I'm here

03:33.882 --> 03:35.313
'cause when we spoke,

03:35.315 --> 03:36.882
you sounded pretty
terrified on the phone.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.216
Do me a favor.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.952
Just give an idea of what's going on.

03:39.954 --> 03:43.388
Hearing voices, getting
things thrown at you.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.424
Seeing some shadow people.

03:45.426 --> 03:49.095
And physically violent at this point.

03:49.097 --> 03:51.363
It's attacking my daughter.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.833
I don't feel like she's
safe here any longer.

03:53.835 --> 03:57.272
The physical attacks on Nikki,
what are we talking about?

03:59.306 --> 04:02.642
And just a couple of weeks ago,

04:02.644 --> 04:05.811
she... she was sexually touched.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.880
That kills me.

04:07.882 --> 04:10.151
I feel like this is
coming straight from Hell.

04:11.586 --> 04:13.521
And I don't know how to fight it.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.755
Is it just you and Nikki that live here?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.726
No. My husband, as well.

04:21.296 --> 04:24.362
Nikki, she's sleeping
in my room at this point

04:24.364 --> 04:26.898
and has been for a year.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.570
My husband, Jeff, he's been
moved to the spare bedroom.

04:30.572 --> 04:32.871
How's that working on your marriage?

04:32.873 --> 04:35.974
Ã„Â°t can be hard at times.
I'm not gonna deny that.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.575
You know, for
a 17-year-old

04:37.577 --> 04:40.078
to be sleeping with
her mom at this point,

04:40.080 --> 04:42.481
it's a little... it's a little strange.

04:42.483 --> 04:46.488
It is. Um... but she is so terrified.

04:49.756 --> 04:51.155
I'm... I'm afraid...

04:51.157 --> 04:54.194
I'm... I'm afraid it's gonna take her.

04:55.729 --> 05:00.099
I've seen the markings around her neck.

05:00.101 --> 05:02.602
What if I'm not there one of those times

05:02.604 --> 05:06.205
that the thing decides to attack her?

05:06.207 --> 05:07.705
That's why I called you guys.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.907
I'm at my wits' end at this point.

05:09.909 --> 05:11.710
I need help, and I need big help.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.412
Let's get some basics out of the way.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.114
How long have you guys been living here?

05:15.116 --> 05:17.982
We moved here in 2011.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.753
My father, he was diagnosed
with cirrhosis of the liver

05:21.755 --> 05:23.388
and died of liver failure.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.958
He was a constant alcoholic.

05:25.960 --> 05:30.895
I made the choice to be closer.
And that's why I moved here.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.698
When did he die?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.299
In December 2012.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.667
All right. And how old
was he when he died?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.169
He was 62.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.671
What kind of guy was he?

05:38.673 --> 05:44.309
Well, this man was loving, caring

05:44.311 --> 05:46.544
but very strict at the same time.

05:46.546 --> 05:50.515
He liked everything cleaned,
everything put in a spot.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.883
Everything had its home.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.854
He would get my mom to walk
around with a white glove

05:54.856 --> 05:58.556
to test the dust on our
beds and our dressers.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.258
Do you think your father's here?

06:00.260 --> 06:02.497
Yes. I know he's here.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.302
There's a dead guy

06:11.304 --> 06:15.741
that is really physically present.

06:15.743 --> 06:21.112
He looks 50s, like late 50s, early 60s.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.948
And he's very fussy.

06:22.950 --> 06:26.253
Almost, like, neurotic,
like with touching people.

06:27.322 --> 06:30.054
Yeah, like a weird fixation for him.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.056
Because of him,

06:32.058 --> 06:35.727
I'm having these,
obsessive thoughts.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.462
Living people here

06:37.464 --> 06:39.931
would have, um, some
pretty bad OCD problems.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.566
And he feels recent.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.936
He was sick. Sick, sick, sick.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.607
He's kind of a disaster.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.212
Deborah, what's going on in the kitchen?

06:54.214 --> 06:57.116
In here, we have
experienced cold spells.

06:57.118 --> 06:59.618
It feels like a good 10-degree drop.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.222
And it feels like when
they are around you,

07:03.224 --> 07:06.092
they feel like they just
drain energy from you.

07:06.094 --> 07:08.559
Like, instantly, you get very tired.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.229
I'm gonna ask you a
silly question, though.

07:10.231 --> 07:12.063
Are you going through any
kind of menopause or anything?

07:12.065 --> 07:13.164
Hell yeah, I am.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.433
But it's... that's...

07:14.435 --> 07:16.234
That's a totally different feeling.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.438
This is not the same.

07:18.871 --> 07:23.075
I feel it staring at me
and watching my every move.

07:23.077 --> 07:24.943
And it's like an evil presence.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.414
It does not want me around.

07:31.085 --> 07:33.719
I'm also seeing this younger guy,

07:33.721 --> 07:36.554
and he is a freak.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.525
He grabs people.

07:39.527 --> 07:42.128
When he touches people,
they get like a...

07:42.130 --> 07:44.530
They actually get, like,
the cold chill thing.

07:44.532 --> 07:47.499
And when he touched my shoulder,

07:47.501 --> 07:51.102
it just felt, like, icy cold.

07:51.104 --> 07:55.140
So the younger dude, right?
When he first shows up, right?

07:55.142 --> 07:58.213
He says, "I want to kill things."

07:59.212 --> 08:02.114
He's very angry, this guy.

08:02.116 --> 08:05.016
And then this dead lady shows up,

08:05.018 --> 08:08.119
and she is all over him,

08:08.121 --> 08:10.789
like, trying to be all
lovey-dovey and ****

08:10.791 --> 08:13.025
But he doesn't want
nothing to do with her.

08:13.027 --> 08:14.225
He doesn't want her there.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.960
And he's livid.

08:15.962 --> 08:18.030
And I just feel like

08:18.032 --> 08:22.200
it's really taking a
toll on these people.

08:22.202 --> 08:29.342
It's like they never
get a moment of... peace.

08:29.344 --> 08:30.178
Ever.

08:34.582 --> 08:38.551
So this is the master bedroom
where you and Nikki sleep?

08:38.553 --> 08:40.952
It's the worst room,
for me, in this house.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.821
I can't sleep.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.388
One evening, I was laying here

08:44.390 --> 08:46.425
in the bed with my daughter, Nikki.

08:46.427 --> 08:49.662
All of a sudden, it just felt
like two hands grabbed me...

08:49.664 --> 08:52.464
one on this side, one on this side...

08:52.466 --> 08:55.399
and real hard, up against the bedpost.

08:55.401 --> 08:57.268
At the same time. Bam!

08:57.270 --> 09:00.071
And at the same time this was going on,

09:00.073 --> 09:01.874
I'm feeling a third hand.

09:01.876 --> 09:05.377
And it feels like a man's
hand grabbing me by my throat

09:05.379 --> 09:08.080
and just kind of like pulling my neck up

09:08.082 --> 09:09.348
and choking me at the same time.

09:09.350 --> 09:11.182
And so how long did it last?

09:11.184 --> 09:12.618
About 2 or 3 minutes.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.820
I felt like I was
getting ready to pass out.

09:14.822 --> 09:18.290
And my daughter, she
immediately jumps out of bed

09:18.292 --> 09:21.292
and she's grabbing Bibles
and she's praying over me

09:21.294 --> 09:23.696
at the same time all this is happening.

09:23.698 --> 09:26.098
I'm afraid to even ask you
if there's anything else.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.566
And there is.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.234
And I drifted off to sleep,

09:30.236 --> 09:35.273
and I'm wakened by a finger... fingers.

09:35.275 --> 09:39.344
Went from here and they go slowly.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.747
And they kept coming.
And they kept coming.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.749
And they kept coming
until it reached my breast.

09:44.751 --> 09:49.522
And I tried to jump up,

09:49.524 --> 09:52.423
but the covers, they
got real, real tight.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.027
Real tight. I couldn't
get out of my covers.

09:55.029 --> 09:58.095
I can't push it off. I can't shoot it.

09:58.097 --> 10:01.199
And all I felt was the hand... the hand.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.768
I was violated.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.904
I've
never told nobody this.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.706
All right. It's okay.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.009
I'm sorry. You're okay?

10:11.011 --> 10:13.144
It's just so much.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.349
I know, baby. I know, babe.

10:23.256 --> 10:28.125
This is more where, like,
that man and woman are.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.195
So what does this guy do to people?

10:30.197 --> 10:32.096
He's capable of touching, grabbing.

10:32.098 --> 10:34.233
Anybody in particular that he targets?

10:34.235 --> 10:36.969
Well, I think females.
I think he's about that.

10:36.971 --> 10:38.671
And he wants to kill people.

10:38.673 --> 10:39.939
Is that what he's trying to do?

10:39.941 --> 10:41.242
Yeah.

10:46.547 --> 10:50.648
God! Stop! Stop! Stop!

10:50.650 --> 10:51.783
Leave her alone!

10:53.453 --> 10:55.921
After interviewing Deborah,
I stepped away for a second.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.023
And that's when I heard
screaming and crying

10:58.025 --> 10:59.291
coming from her room.

10:59.293 --> 11:02.594
Stop! It's my daughter, not yours!

11:02.596 --> 11:04.662
You have no right to touch her!

11:04.664 --> 11:07.332
I rushed over, and all I can say is

11:07.334 --> 11:09.469
I've never seen anything like this.

11:15.708 --> 11:18.811
She just got attacked.

11:18.813 --> 11:21.680
It started on her back
first, just scratching.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.481
And then it grabbed
her again by the neck.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.318
Geez. Look at that.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.787
You can see the welts.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.505
- What happened?
- She just got attacked.

11:46.741 --> 11:50.341
It started on her back
first, just scratching.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.043
And then it grabbed
her again by the neck.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.214
Geez. Look at that.

11:55.216 --> 11:57.248
You can see the welts.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.350
I feel really helpless.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.585
Whatever's here can go to Hell.

12:11.265 --> 12:14.532
So, how are you doing? You're
doing better from before?

12:14.534 --> 12:17.002
I was able to get some rest,

12:17.004 --> 12:18.436
and I'm doing a little bit better.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.340
- That happens a lot to you, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

12:21.342 --> 12:24.176
Okay. Well, you're the
reason Mom called us in.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.944
She thinks you're in danger.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.779
Do you feel the same way, that
you're in deep danger here?

12:28.781 --> 12:30.181
At times, I really do.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.518
I'm scared for my family.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.619
Okay.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.055
I want to talk about all the
experiences you're having.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.223
What's going on?

12:38.225 --> 12:39.425
I'd get scratched.

12:39.427 --> 12:41.158
Like, earlier today, I was,

12:41.160 --> 12:43.461
and I would get scratched in the shower.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.763
I'd feel these burning sensations.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.098
And then I'd look down,

12:47.100 --> 12:48.700
and I have scratches all over me.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.469
Now, what do these
scratches exactly look like?

12:50.471 --> 12:51.670
Are they long?

12:51.672 --> 12:55.343
Actually, these are
what it can look like.

12:58.911 --> 13:01.680
Geez.

13:01.682 --> 13:04.349
So it's almost exactly
like what I saw before?

13:04.351 --> 13:05.450
Yes.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.219
You're not doing this
to yourself, are you?

13:07.221 --> 13:08.954
- No, I'm not.
- Look at me.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.723
I'm not doing this to myself.

13:10.725 --> 13:12.791
I
wouldn't do this to myself.

13:12.793 --> 13:16.994
Okay. 'Cause sometimes people
do things to get attention.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.330
Yeah, I know.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.399
Are you getting touched any other way?

13:21.401 --> 13:22.700
Yeah.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.769
Um, I had been sleeping
out on the couch,

13:25.771 --> 13:30.642
and I started feeling like
something just touched me,

13:30.644 --> 13:31.710
just like that,

13:31.712 --> 13:33.581
and then go all the way down my body.

13:35.216 --> 13:37.148
It got sexually inappropriate with you?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.316
Yes. It just really freaked me out.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.954
I've never been touched
like that before.

13:41.956 --> 13:43.787
Okay. It's all right.

13:43.789 --> 13:46.325
I feel like because of it
singling me out all the time,

13:46.327 --> 13:49.297
maybe it has something to do with me.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.433
The younger guy,

13:55.435 --> 13:58.303
he stated that he would
like to be killing things.

13:58.305 --> 14:01.373
Would the living in
here be aware of him?

14:01.375 --> 14:03.307
Yeah, no, they're
aware. Yeah. Totally.

14:03.309 --> 14:06.746
Um, maybe feeling, like, movement.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.149
Hearing, like, mumbling,

14:11.151 --> 14:13.218
feeling pressure on the bed,

14:13.220 --> 14:15.122
like, when they're laying on the bed.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.658
I don't trust him.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.332
Jeff, I was talking to your wife,

14:28.334 --> 14:29.634
and I understand this is
where you're sleeping now?

14:29.636 --> 14:30.902
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.437
I mean, that can't be
good for the marriage.

14:32.439 --> 14:35.806
It is aggravating,
frustrating, you know,

14:35.808 --> 14:38.042
that you just want to...

14:38.044 --> 14:39.510
Right.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.413
Well, earlier, I walked
away for a second.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.449
I come back and your
daughter's getting attacked.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.252
It's something I've never seen before.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.154
It... it just seems to
go after, you know, women.

14:50.156 --> 14:53.224
To me, that's weak and...

14:53.226 --> 14:55.659
- Cowardice.
- Yeah, exactly.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.928
So you consider yourself a skeptic?

14:57.930 --> 14:59.965
No, not anymore.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.867
So what changed your mind?

15:01.869 --> 15:04.202
The time when I saw for myself.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.904
There was a pot on the counter.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.407
It actually went off of that

15:09.409 --> 15:11.409
and onto the floor in the next room.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.311
- You saw this happen?
- Yes.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.946
How did you react when you saw that?

15:14.948 --> 15:16.181
It got me pretty angry,

15:16.183 --> 15:18.182
I mean, to the point
where I screamed at it,

15:18.184 --> 15:19.984
"Come on, you coward, S.O.B.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.619
Here I am. Take me."

15:22.621 --> 15:24.455
Have you seen anything else like that?

15:24.457 --> 15:27.191
I've seen, like, shadow figures

15:27.193 --> 15:28.494
out of the corner of my eye.

15:28.496 --> 15:30.095
In which part of the house?

15:30.097 --> 15:32.797
Usually right around between
the bedroom I'm in now

15:32.799 --> 15:34.066
and my daughter's room.

15:34.068 --> 15:35.867
- Okay, so right here basically?
- Yeah.

15:35.869 --> 15:38.036
Could you tell if it
was a male or a female?

15:38.038 --> 15:39.771
- Male.
- Okay.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.806
I got to ask you a question
as a husband and a father.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.508
Do you think the girls are in danger?

15:43.510 --> 15:47.711
I don't really want to admit
it, but they are getting harmed.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.748
I want to protect them.

15:49.750 --> 15:51.816
I never thought I'd
ever be in a situation

15:51.818 --> 15:53.051
that I wouldn't be able to.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.289
And I don't know what to do.

15:59.425 --> 16:04.363
That old fussy man, the
OCD man, he's in here a lot.

16:04.365 --> 16:09.167
He's... He tells me, "I'm
trying to wake them up.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.970
Wake up! Wake up!"

16:11.972 --> 16:13.370
Wake who up?

16:13.372 --> 16:15.941
I see...

16:15.943 --> 16:17.776
I think it... I think it's a male,

16:17.778 --> 16:19.912
probably in his 30s or 40s,

16:19.914 --> 16:24.284
waking up because he is
hearing, "Wake up! Wake up!"

16:26.286 --> 16:30.721
The dead OCD man is
trying to help this person.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.825
He's trying to warn.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.194
He's trying to give a warning.

16:35.196 --> 16:36.960
About what?

16:36.962 --> 16:38.598
Everything in this house.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.566
I think that this person

16:42.568 --> 16:45.936
is probably the most sensitive
person in the household,

16:45.938 --> 16:47.104
and because of that,

16:47.106 --> 16:49.040
is being severely affected by this.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.609
He's very depressed.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.711
He's trying to tell them

16:53.713 --> 16:57.150
they probably should get out
of here as quickly as possible.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.949
So one of the first things
I do when I start an investigation

17:11.049 --> 17:13.982
is reach out to the local
cops, reporters, and historians.

17:13.983 --> 17:16.349
I just got a call
back from a genealogist

17:16.352 --> 17:19.088
who says she might be able to help.

17:19.089 --> 17:20.723
Turns out,

17:20.724 --> 17:22.625
one of the original owners
of Deborah and Jeff's property

17:22.627 --> 17:24.796
had a real tragic time there.

17:29.234 --> 17:30.799
Now, you mentioned on the phone

17:30.801 --> 17:33.636
one of the original owners of
the property I'm investigating

17:33.638 --> 17:35.838
had a pretty tough time
while they were there.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.307
But before we get to that,
though, who was this guy?

17:38.309 --> 17:40.942
His name was Mills H. Eure.

17:40.944 --> 17:44.713
He got the land in 1840,
inherited from his grandmother.

17:44.715 --> 17:48.050
Okay, so the land he inherits.
What kind of land is it?

17:48.052 --> 17:50.453
- It was most likely farmland.
- Okay.

17:50.455 --> 17:53.054
Most likely a plantation.

17:53.056 --> 17:58.926
And the 1860 census we do have,
where Mills owned 11 slaves.

17:58.928 --> 18:01.397
Now, Cathy, you mentioned on the phone

18:01.399 --> 18:03.165
that there was tragedy with this family.

18:03.167 --> 18:04.466
What was the story?

18:04.468 --> 18:07.935
Well, Mills married in the early 1840s

18:07.937 --> 18:09.604
to a Miss Williams.

18:09.606 --> 18:13.175
They had a little girl in 1845.

18:13.177 --> 18:16.512
And by 1850, the mother was dead.

18:16.514 --> 18:17.612
Do we know what she died of?

18:17.614 --> 18:18.847
We do not.

18:18.849 --> 18:21.249
North Carolina did not
require death records

18:21.251 --> 18:22.385
at that point in time.

18:22.387 --> 18:24.185
Does he ever remarry?

18:24.187 --> 18:25.620
He does.

18:25.622 --> 18:31.527
He married in 1853 to
Sarah Louisa Savage.

18:31.529 --> 18:34.562
She was 18. He was 32.

18:34.564 --> 18:36.999
And then tragedy hits him again

18:37.001 --> 18:39.568
because the second wife died in 1859.

18:39.570 --> 18:41.203
She was dead by 24.

18:41.205 --> 18:42.369
What does she die of?

18:42.371 --> 18:43.606
Again, we don't know.

18:43.608 --> 18:45.307
All right. So I'm afraid to even ask.

18:45.309 --> 18:46.809
Did this guy ever get married again?

18:46.811 --> 18:48.010
No, he did not.

18:48.012 --> 18:50.979
He remained single for
the rest of his life.

18:50.981 --> 18:52.981
Well, this is pretty good information.

18:52.983 --> 18:55.384
I don't know how it's gonna
help in the investigation,

18:55.386 --> 18:56.818
but it's interesting

18:56.820 --> 18:59.754
how this poor guy lost two
wives pretty young in life.

18:59.756 --> 19:02.357
I do have something
else that might help you.

19:02.359 --> 19:06.328
His only son died in a very tragic way.

19:06.330 --> 19:07.663
What happened?

19:07.665 --> 19:10.299
He apparently was an alcoholic.

19:10.301 --> 19:14.503
He went on a 10-day bender,
and he was firing his pistol.

19:14.505 --> 19:16.570
People were running left and right,

19:16.572 --> 19:18.506
trying to get out of his way.

19:18.508 --> 19:21.676
He came upon a local
merchant, Edward Gatlin,

19:21.678 --> 19:24.245
and told him he was going to kill him.

19:24.247 --> 19:25.514
Okay.

19:25.516 --> 19:27.849
Gatlin managed to reach his gun first

19:27.851 --> 19:30.554
and fired and shot
young Mills in the back.

19:31.988 --> 19:35.456
We have a newspaper article
that talks about that.

19:35.458 --> 19:39.096
Mills lingered on and died 2 days later.

19:43.132 --> 19:47.468
This guy was, like,
super psycho when he was alive.

19:47.470 --> 19:49.804
The second I walked back outside,

19:49.806 --> 19:52.407
the young dead guy is all over me.

19:52.409 --> 19:55.711
And I'm starting to see he
was a violent man in life.

19:55.713 --> 19:58.416
He's telling me he wants to kill things.

20:00.583 --> 20:03.185
He probably wasn't the nicest dude.

20:03.187 --> 20:05.389
He might've hurt people.

20:07.190 --> 20:08.990
Nobody's at rest here.

20:08.992 --> 20:11.259
The living aren't. The dead aren't.

20:11.261 --> 20:12.261
It's hard.

20:15.331 --> 20:17.965
So far, I know the
previous landowner Mills Eure

20:17.967 --> 20:20.636
suffered one tragedy after another,

20:20.638 --> 20:23.105
losing two wives at a very young age.

20:23.107 --> 20:25.944
But I need to see if
there's anything more.

20:26.910 --> 20:29.810
Searching through old
records, I find Thomas Pitman,

20:29.812 --> 20:32.047
who purchased the land from Mills Eure.

20:32.049 --> 20:34.582
Turns out Pitman also lost two wives

20:34.584 --> 20:36.553
while living on the property.

20:38.456 --> 20:42.724
Believe it or not, this guy's
granddaughter is still alive.

20:42.726 --> 20:44.693
She's 96, feisty as hell,

20:44.695 --> 20:46.998
and willing to talk
about her grandfather.

20:51.569 --> 20:55.370
So your grandfather, you remember him?

20:55.372 --> 20:57.939
- Now, how old
were you when he passed away?

20:57.941 --> 20:59.307
Ten years old.

20:59.309 --> 21:00.908
Now, I understand

21:00.910 --> 21:03.779
your grandfather purchased
my client's property in 1882.

21:03.781 --> 21:06.648
Yeah. But I wasn't around then.

21:06.650 --> 21:08.383
I would hope not.

21:09.652 --> 21:11.252
What kind of a man was he?

21:11.254 --> 21:16.224
He was a good man, always
doing something for us.

21:16.226 --> 21:18.560
I know that your grandfather's
first wife, Annie,

21:18.562 --> 21:20.963
died in 1874,

21:20.965 --> 21:23.197
but the records are
unclear as to how she died.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.166
Do you have any idea?

21:24.168 --> 21:26.502
It was diphtheria.

21:26.504 --> 21:28.436
Now, I know your grandfather remarried

21:28.438 --> 21:29.437
to a woman named Sally.

21:29.439 --> 21:31.039
Sally died in 1891,

21:31.041 --> 21:34.445
but I couldn't find any records
to tell me what she died of.

21:38.415 --> 21:40.247
Okay, so she died from the same thing?

21:41.685 --> 21:44.351
I know your grandfather
lost two wives at this point.

21:44.353 --> 21:45.486
Did he remarry again?

21:45.488 --> 21:48.290
Yes, he did, in 1894.

21:48.292 --> 21:50.925
Stella, that's my grandmother.

21:50.927 --> 21:54.631
That man on the end is my grandfather.

21:56.300 --> 21:58.868
Now, do you know when he died?

21:58.870 --> 22:02.774
He died one week after
his 80th birthday.

22:08.245 --> 22:14.649
Unfortunately, this is
not, a happy place.

22:14.651 --> 22:17.453
Like, I'm hearing that word "sorrow."

22:17.455 --> 22:19.788
There's a lot of sorrow here.

22:19.790 --> 22:22.960
A lot of sorrow, a lot
of pain, a lot of loss.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.400
Boy.

22:33.771 --> 22:36.605
There's something very wrong.

22:36.607 --> 22:39.110
Nothing is as it seems here. Nothing.

22:40.677 --> 22:43.648
It's pretty crazy.

22:48.718 --> 22:50.386
If you need us to investigate

22:50.388 --> 22:52.087
unexplained activity in your home,

22:52.089 --> 22:54.990
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

22:54.992 --> 22:57.259
Click on "Help me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

22:57.261 --> 22:58.162
and we'll help if we can.

23:05.468 --> 23:08.604
Now, another thing that
caught my eye during research

23:08.606 --> 23:11.506
was The Buffaloes, a deadly gang

23:11.508 --> 23:13.408
that tore through town
and murdered a woman

23:13.410 --> 23:15.042
right next door to my client's property.

23:15.044 --> 23:17.545
I'm on my way to meet with a historian

23:17.547 --> 23:19.347
who says that The Buffaloes

23:19.349 --> 23:21.686
were cold-blooded killers and thieves.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.522
So, Chris, I know a
lot about the Civil War

23:28.524 --> 23:29.958
from research I've done.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.493
But I never heard of The Buffaloes.

23:31.495 --> 23:33.762
Buffaloes were a ragtag group of men.

23:33.764 --> 23:36.397
This is a picture of
some Buffalo soldiers.

23:36.399 --> 23:38.899
They were a wandering group

23:38.901 --> 23:41.970
who were ex-Confederate soldiers,

23:41.972 --> 23:43.839
runaway slaves, thieves.

23:43.841 --> 23:47.141
I mean, biracial? I mean, 1860s? Really?

23:47.143 --> 23:48.676
Very, very unusual.

23:48.678 --> 23:50.744
All right. So what would these guys do?

23:50.746 --> 23:53.514
Well, they went on a huge
crime spree in the area.

23:53.516 --> 23:56.652
They would attack farms,
steal the people's property.

23:56.654 --> 23:58.253
If they met any resistance,

23:58.255 --> 24:00.957
they wouldn't hesitate
to kill the person.

24:03.494 --> 24:06.027
There are men outside,

24:06.029 --> 24:07.396
all different colors.

24:07.398 --> 24:11.032
They seemed to be very agitated.

24:11.034 --> 24:14.168
It seems like a very desolate place,

24:14.170 --> 24:18.374
but I'm getting a lot
of wrongful deaths here.

24:18.376 --> 24:20.945
That's how it feels with these men.

24:22.146 --> 24:24.045
So now, I know they
attacked and killed a woman

24:24.047 --> 24:26.281
that lived right next door
to my client's property.

24:26.283 --> 24:27.950
Do you know anything about that?

24:27.952 --> 24:30.118
Yes, her name was Mrs. Spivey.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.355
On a raid in February 1865,
they attacked her house.

24:33.357 --> 24:35.224
They took all of her belongings,

24:35.226 --> 24:38.292
and then they wanted a
little something extra.

24:38.294 --> 24:39.695
And she refused them,

24:39.697 --> 24:42.397
and they summarily
shot and bayoneted her.

24:42.399 --> 24:44.133
Okay.

24:44.135 --> 24:45.599
On that same day,

24:45.601 --> 24:47.702
they actually attacked
your client's property.

24:47.704 --> 24:49.972
Okay, who was living there at the time?

24:49.974 --> 24:51.041
Mills Eure.

24:52.075 --> 24:54.076
I already came across
him in my research.

24:54.078 --> 24:55.210
What happened?

24:55.212 --> 24:58.079
They attacked, took all of his property,

24:58.081 --> 24:59.050
and beat him up.

25:01.851 --> 25:07.321
I see this woman, and
she's got long black hair.

25:07.323 --> 25:08.956
I'm just, like, in her,

25:08.958 --> 25:12.394
and I'm feeling a man grabbing me

25:12.396 --> 25:15.066
and, like, slitting my throat.

25:17.001 --> 25:19.266
Then he, like...

25:19.268 --> 25:21.970
caved in basically half her face.

25:21.972 --> 25:26.344
I felt, like, this horrible
pain in the right eye socket.

25:28.645 --> 25:32.547
And then I hear lots of
women screaming and moaning.

25:32.549 --> 25:35.550
And then, quickly, very
quickly, I see a male

25:35.552 --> 25:39.253
who's dressed in very
dark blue with gold trim.

25:39.255 --> 25:43.024
I've never seen any kind of
military dress like this before.

25:43.026 --> 25:45.629
All I heard was, "He is a murderer."

25:48.764 --> 25:50.964
All right. So did these
guys ever get caught,

25:50.966 --> 25:52.800
or did they just get away with it?

25:52.802 --> 25:54.368
Yes, they did get caught.

25:54.370 --> 25:56.070
The Confederate Army came in,

25:56.072 --> 25:58.307
attacked their base camp,
and captured 14 of these men.

25:58.309 --> 26:01.943
Ten were returned as deserters
to their original unit,

26:01.945 --> 26:03.579
but four of these men

26:03.581 --> 26:06.681
were taken to Mrs.
Spivey's house and executed.

26:06.683 --> 26:09.520
And here's a newspaper
account of that attack.

26:11.021 --> 26:13.688
And what was the reason for
going back to the property?

26:13.690 --> 26:16.625
To teach a lesson to any of
the other thieves in the area.

26:16.627 --> 26:18.029
Okay.

26:24.001 --> 26:26.701
I saw several
dead people on my walk,

26:26.703 --> 26:29.404
but the young dead man
tormenting a living woman

26:29.406 --> 26:31.473
had me the most concerned.

26:31.475 --> 26:34.842
His face is all black.

26:34.844 --> 26:37.479
Thin nose.

26:37.481 --> 26:39.981
He had a weird kind of look.

26:39.983 --> 26:44.588
He was standing on the bed
and touching her shoulder.

26:48.491 --> 26:49.991
Is this what you saw?

26:49.993 --> 26:52.029
Yes.

27:12.248 --> 27:15.250
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:15.252 --> 27:17.386
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:17.388 --> 27:19.954
and our clients for the first time.

27:19.956 --> 27:22.691
Amy, I'd like you to meet
Deborah, her husband, Jeff,

27:22.693 --> 27:24.059
and their daughter, Nikki.

27:24.061 --> 27:25.927
Now, I spent the day with the family

27:25.929 --> 27:28.262
and got a firsthand look
at how bad things are.

27:28.264 --> 27:29.830
And it was very disturbing.

27:29.832 --> 27:32.634
Probably one of the most
serious cases we've ever done.

27:32.636 --> 27:36.204
And the family's convinced
that whatever's going on

27:36.206 --> 27:37.839
is going after Nikki.

27:37.841 --> 27:42.077
And they'll do whatever
it takes to keep her safe.

27:42.079 --> 27:43.977
Now that Amy knows

27:43.979 --> 27:46.747
just a little bit about what
you guys are going through,

27:46.749 --> 27:48.818
I'm gonna ask her to
describe the walk for us.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.721
When I was outside,

27:52.723 --> 27:56.224
I saw this woman that
was being murdered.

27:56.226 --> 27:58.960
She was in her 20s or 30s.

27:58.962 --> 28:01.162
She had long black hair.

28:01.164 --> 28:03.898
And I suddenly felt like I
was kind of inside her body.

28:03.900 --> 28:08.535
And a male came up and grabbed me

28:08.537 --> 28:10.040
and slit my throat.

28:12.309 --> 28:17.212
I felt horrible pain in my eye socket

28:17.214 --> 28:19.080
and also my nose.

28:19.082 --> 28:20.648
And then, I saw a male

28:20.650 --> 28:24.252
who was wearing this really
strange military outfit.

28:24.254 --> 28:26.954
And it was dark blue with gold.

28:26.956 --> 28:29.256
And he kind of had a
strange hat, as well.

28:29.258 --> 28:30.591
It was, like, more like a cowboy hat.

28:30.593 --> 28:33.561
There were quite a few.

28:33.563 --> 28:35.463
And they were all
different ages and races,

28:35.465 --> 28:36.864
but they were all male.

28:36.866 --> 28:39.333
Well, I think I can
help you out on this one.

28:39.335 --> 28:40.835
Back in the 1860s,

28:40.837 --> 28:43.070
there was a group of
outlaws called The Buffaloes.

28:43.072 --> 28:45.307
The strange thing about
this group of men were

28:45.309 --> 28:46.674
they were multiracial,

28:46.676 --> 28:49.543
which was pretty odd
for the time period.

28:49.545 --> 28:51.479
It was during the Civil War.

28:51.481 --> 28:52.981
They were a gang made up

28:52.983 --> 28:55.817
of ex-Civil War soldiers,
criminals, escaped slaves.

28:55.819 --> 28:57.019
Wow.

28:57.021 --> 28:58.686
I was actually able to get a photo.

28:58.688 --> 28:59.820
You mentioned the uniforms.

28:59.822 --> 29:03.326
Yeah. How weird.

29:06.529 --> 29:09.764
Now, in February of 1865,

29:09.766 --> 29:11.399
they came onto your property

29:11.401 --> 29:15.235
that was inhabited by a guy
named Mills Eure at the time.

29:15.237 --> 29:16.704
I have an article here

29:16.706 --> 29:19.174
that says how they
nearly beat him to death

29:19.176 --> 29:20.575
and stole all his property.

29:20.577 --> 29:22.577
Now, right after that happened,

29:22.579 --> 29:25.681
they decided to go right
next door to your property

29:25.683 --> 29:27.549
and attack a woman named Mrs. Spivey.

29:27.551 --> 29:29.783
The historian I had spoke to

29:29.785 --> 29:31.919
said they tried to rape
her after they robbed her.

29:31.921 --> 29:33.221
She fought back,

29:33.223 --> 29:36.957
and they wind up bayoneting
her and shooting her.

29:38.227 --> 29:40.627
She died right in the property.

29:40.629 --> 29:42.797
Now, 14 of these guys were caught.

29:42.799 --> 29:44.733
They turned 10 over
to the Confederate Army

29:44.735 --> 29:46.134
'cause they were deserters.

29:46.136 --> 29:47.801
And the other four,

29:47.803 --> 29:49.904
they actually brought back
to to where Mrs. Spivey lived.

29:49.906 --> 29:51.939
They executed those men
right there on the property.

29:51.941 --> 29:52.976
Okay.

29:57.447 --> 30:01.515
Inside the house, I encountered a couple

30:01.517 --> 30:04.985
of very solid, conscious dead people.

30:04.987 --> 30:07.222
One was an older man.

30:07.224 --> 30:08.924
He has severe OCD.

30:08.926 --> 30:11.525
And I felt like the living

30:11.527 --> 30:13.560
might have some of these experiences,

30:13.562 --> 30:16.365
going through spells of OCD.

30:16.367 --> 30:19.001
So you'll, like, work
a problem to death,

30:19.003 --> 30:21.136
or you'll reflect on something to death.

30:21.138 --> 30:24.405
And he likes messing with
people's ears and faces.

30:24.407 --> 30:26.608
He likes to touch that.

30:26.610 --> 30:28.510
You just hit that on cue.

30:28.512 --> 30:29.910
The hair pulling,

30:29.912 --> 30:33.048
the messing with my
face constantly at night.

30:33.050 --> 30:36.885
And the OCD part, I have
seen that especially on her.

30:36.887 --> 30:39.687
Yes. I can get on one thought,

30:39.689 --> 30:41.756
and I can just wring it

30:41.758 --> 30:44.525
and just take it as far as
it can go, and then some.

30:46.095 --> 30:48.795
But does that happen to
you when you're not home?

30:48.797 --> 30:50.865
No.

30:50.867 --> 30:53.734
Do you have any idea who this
guy might've been in life?

30:53.736 --> 30:55.803
He was in his late 60s.

30:55.805 --> 30:59.107
He seemed short. He
died fairly recently.

30:59.109 --> 31:02.843
He had compulsive
behaviors in life, you know.

31:02.845 --> 31:05.480
He was fussy with other living people.

31:05.482 --> 31:07.014
He was very neurotic.

31:07.016 --> 31:09.015
He's not okay right now.

31:09.017 --> 31:11.087
Well, that's the 800-pound
gorilla in the room.

31:12.155 --> 31:13.454
My father.

31:13.456 --> 31:15.223
Really?

31:15.225 --> 31:18.092
He was 62 when he died.

31:18.094 --> 31:19.426
Okay.

31:19.428 --> 31:22.329
He was a... just a hard-ass, period.

31:22.331 --> 31:24.933
Strict, loving at the same time.

31:24.935 --> 31:28.235
My mom, she had to walk around
the house with a white glove,

31:28.237 --> 31:29.436
check for dust.

31:29.438 --> 31:31.173
Wow, okay.

31:31.175 --> 31:32.573
Compulsive.

31:32.575 --> 31:38.081
So the thing is, he's drawn to you.

31:39.983 --> 31:43.348
He's trying to always talk to you

31:43.350 --> 31:44.819
to give you warnings.

31:44.821 --> 31:49.724
He tells me, "I'm
trying to wake them up.

31:49.726 --> 31:52.393
Wake up! Wake up!"

31:52.395 --> 31:54.562
But you're just completely, like,

31:54.564 --> 31:56.667
I guess kind of ignoring him?

32:02.205 --> 32:04.038
He's trying to warn you.

32:04.040 --> 32:08.408
He's trying to protect from
the other dead that are here.

32:08.410 --> 32:09.977
You were hinting at him,

32:09.979 --> 32:11.779
like you think he may
have some abilities.

32:11.781 --> 32:14.115
You do have quite a few
dead people around you.

32:14.117 --> 32:19.052
And it feels like they can
really talk to you, so...

32:19.054 --> 32:23.957
Well, I got a couple of
photos of Deborah's father.

32:23.959 --> 32:26.194
This is her wedding day.

32:26.196 --> 32:28.695
Okay.

32:28.697 --> 32:30.964
Is that who you think it was?

32:30.966 --> 32:33.868
It looks like him, but way thinner.

32:33.870 --> 32:35.002
Way thinner.

32:35.004 --> 32:37.304
And when he passed, he was way thinner.

32:37.306 --> 32:38.740
Okay, that makes sense.

32:38.742 --> 32:40.207
When we spoke,

32:40.209 --> 32:42.543
you said you thought your father
was there from time to time.

32:42.545 --> 32:44.113
Yeah.

32:47.184 --> 32:50.016
Here, take that.

32:50.018 --> 32:51.587
Thank you.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.797
Just miss him. I miss him a lot.

33:03.966 --> 33:06.768
You mentioned you ran into
a couple of dead people.

33:06.770 --> 33:08.069
Who else?

33:08.071 --> 33:11.071
One of the people that
I'm most concerned about

33:11.073 --> 33:12.406
is this young dead guy.

33:12.408 --> 33:15.041
He is a threat.

33:15.043 --> 33:16.677
It, to me, felt like

33:16.679 --> 33:18.512
he didn't particularly care for women.

33:18.514 --> 33:23.685
I think he's kind of a psycho.

33:23.687 --> 33:25.352
My assumption was

33:25.354 --> 33:29.291
that he wasn't a particularly
good person when he was alive.

33:29.293 --> 33:32.963
At one point, he was like,
"Yeah, I want to kill things."

33:35.364 --> 33:37.865
Well, it... it's a shot in the dark,

33:37.867 --> 33:39.867
but remember the guy I
told you about, Mills Eure,

33:39.869 --> 33:41.269
who got beat up by The Buffaloes?

33:41.271 --> 33:42.537
Yes.

33:42.539 --> 33:44.772
He had a son, Mills
Jr., who was a drunk.

33:44.774 --> 33:47.641
And one time, he went on
a 10-day alcohol bender.

33:47.643 --> 33:49.010
Apparently, he wound up

33:49.012 --> 33:51.345
walking through the
streets downtown nearby,

33:51.347 --> 33:53.013
shooting his gun in the air.

33:53.015 --> 33:55.483
And people were scurrying
all over the place.

33:55.485 --> 33:57.685
He approaches this local merchant

33:57.687 --> 33:59.553
by the name of Edward Gatlin.

33:59.555 --> 34:01.289
And he says, "I'm gonna...
I'm gonna kill you."

34:01.291 --> 34:02.656
And he goes for his gun.

34:02.658 --> 34:04.158
Gatlin was a quicker shot,

34:04.160 --> 34:06.093
pulled out his gun, and
shoots him in the back.

34:06.095 --> 34:09.530
There's only other one weird
thing about the property.

34:09.532 --> 34:11.063
And you mentioned women?

34:12.668 --> 34:15.637
Mills had two wives who
died young on the property,

34:15.639 --> 34:18.004
and there's no record
of what they died of.

34:18.005 --> 34:20.774
Then I spoke with
a 96-year-old woman

34:20.775 --> 34:24.411
whose grandfather
bought the land in 1882.

34:24.414 --> 34:26.547
His name was Thomas Pitman.

34:26.550 --> 34:29.350
He had lost two wives
as well on the property.

34:29.351 --> 34:31.251
- Wow.
- And they were both young.

34:31.253 --> 34:34.388
Interesting. Okay.

34:34.389 --> 34:36.591
Now, this young dead guy you saw,

34:36.592 --> 34:38.760
what could he do to affect the living?

34:38.762 --> 34:41.062
Well, the thing was, a female showed up,

34:41.063 --> 34:42.963
a dead female.

34:42.965 --> 34:44.197
And this person

34:44.199 --> 34:47.534
seemed to have been in
a relationship with him.

34:47.536 --> 34:51.004
And he was very irritated
that she showed up.

34:51.005 --> 34:53.007
And they were, like, arguing.

34:53.010 --> 34:55.708
And he was, like, you
know, really pissed off.

34:55.710 --> 34:57.077
What I saw was, like,

34:57.079 --> 35:00.214
the living picking up on
their anger and fighting,

35:00.216 --> 35:01.649
and so they're emulating them.

35:01.651 --> 35:03.084
So they're fighting, as well.

35:03.086 --> 35:07.588
And if he's around, you
could feel, like, ice.

35:07.590 --> 35:08.923
Like, it was really, like...

35:08.925 --> 35:11.158
can go right through you, you know?

35:11.160 --> 35:12.894
You can tell when he's around

35:12.896 --> 35:16.229
because it's like total
10-degree drop instantly.

35:16.231 --> 35:17.932
With the arguing,

35:17.934 --> 35:20.033
I've actually seen
that between my parents.

35:20.035 --> 35:23.037
It's just so much
drama, so much argument,

35:23.039 --> 35:26.543
so much, just, chaos.

35:27.644 --> 35:29.910
We're not together.

35:29.912 --> 35:31.245
We're not solid.

35:31.247 --> 35:32.979
Okay.

35:32.981 --> 35:34.914
Well, what concerned me

35:34.916 --> 35:37.417
was the room with the pastel bedspread.

35:37.419 --> 35:38.952
That's Nikki's room,

35:38.954 --> 35:41.856
but she's so terrified in
there, she sleeps with her mom.

35:41.858 --> 35:44.727
They're maybe feeling, like, movement.

35:46.229 --> 35:49.129
Hearing, like, mumbling,

35:49.131 --> 35:51.064
feeling pressure on the bed,

35:51.066 --> 35:52.899
like, when they're laying on the bed.

35:52.901 --> 35:56.671
He was grabbing my shoulder,

35:56.673 --> 36:00.307
and he was grabbing the back of my leg.

36:00.309 --> 36:03.343
And because he can be so physical,

36:03.345 --> 36:05.646
that's where it gets scary,

36:05.648 --> 36:08.785
because he does really hate women.

36:10.887 --> 36:13.053
Deborah and Nikki both feel

36:13.055 --> 36:15.622
that whatever's in the
house is targeting women.

36:15.624 --> 36:18.193
Everything that
you said about the bedroom,

36:18.195 --> 36:20.560
I've experienced everything.

36:20.562 --> 36:22.363
The voices, the mumbling.

36:22.365 --> 36:24.231
I've felt the bed shake.

36:24.233 --> 36:26.867
Once, I got pushed back,

36:26.869 --> 36:29.937
and I felt like something
was on top of my chest.

36:29.939 --> 36:30.972
Like, I couldn't breathe.

36:30.974 --> 36:32.142
It felt like something was on my neck.

36:32.242 --> 36:33.508
It also happened to Deborah.

36:33.510 --> 36:35.042
She got attacked the same type of way.

36:35.044 --> 36:36.443
I was sitting on the bed.

36:36.445 --> 36:37.912
My hands are just in my lap.

36:37.914 --> 36:39.280
And all of a sudden,

36:39.282 --> 36:41.582
they flew back and
hit the headboard hard.

36:41.584 --> 36:43.850
And my throat just literally went up,

36:43.852 --> 36:45.120
and I'm being choked.

36:45.122 --> 36:48.823
They've been, um...

36:48.825 --> 36:51.225
touched inappropriately, both women.

36:51.227 --> 36:53.127
I was kind of sleeping.

36:53.129 --> 36:54.495
I was going in and out.

36:54.497 --> 36:55.363
And all of a sudden,

36:55.365 --> 36:57.298
I started feeling something touch me.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.834
And it was going from my neck,
and I felt it go lower, lower,

36:59.836 --> 37:01.570
then I was feeling it just caress me.

37:01.572 --> 37:03.071
My gosh.

37:03.073 --> 37:04.338
But she's not the only

37:04.340 --> 37:05.906
one that's been touched that way.

37:05.908 --> 37:07.408
So has Deborah.

37:07.410 --> 37:10.081
He's done that, but he
got a little further.

37:13.983 --> 37:18.153
Why didn't you tell me about these?

37:18.155 --> 37:20.388
How can I tell you

37:20.390 --> 37:24.691
that I think I just almost
got raped by that dead guy?

37:29.231 --> 37:33.536
I had a sketch done of what I saw.

37:38.476 --> 37:40.077
Geez!

37:47.015 --> 37:49.551
Can he really do this?

37:49.553 --> 37:50.684
Deborah, he has.

37:52.988 --> 37:55.091
Can he take her life?

38:12.175 --> 38:14.477
I did do a sketch.

38:20.885 --> 38:22.486
Geez!

38:34.930 --> 38:37.499
Can he really do this?

38:37.501 --> 38:38.633
Deborah, he has.

38:41.671 --> 38:43.607
Can he take her life?

38:45.209 --> 38:46.310
Yeah.

38:48.378 --> 38:53.316
He is insane, and he
wants to kill people.

39:01.825 --> 39:03.925
It would scratch me everywhere...

39:03.927 --> 39:09.129
my chest, my back, my stomach, my legs.

39:09.131 --> 39:12.901
You can actually see the
scratch marks going all over.

39:12.903 --> 39:15.635
And I got photos of them.

39:15.637 --> 39:17.807
Wow.

39:19.776 --> 39:23.678
I've always felt he wanted her.

39:23.680 --> 39:27.318
He can do anything,
but I can't stop him.

39:31.153 --> 39:33.153
Well, guys, I know
tonight was a rough night,

39:33.155 --> 39:34.423
but I don't think any of us

39:34.425 --> 39:36.156
thought it was gonna be an easy one.

39:36.158 --> 39:37.658
No.

39:37.660 --> 39:40.028
Now we need to answer
your big question...

39:40.030 --> 39:42.296
how to keep the women of the house safe.

39:42.298 --> 39:44.332
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:44.334 --> 39:49.504
What I would like to see happen
is for a medium to come out

39:49.506 --> 39:55.075
and for you to receive a
reading with this medium

39:55.077 --> 39:57.914
to talk to your father.

39:59.782 --> 40:01.582
- Are you okay with that?
- Yeah.

40:01.584 --> 40:02.950
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:02.952 --> 40:06.455
Okay. He'll have a lot
of good advice for you.

40:06.457 --> 40:08.689
I think it'll be a
really good experience

40:08.691 --> 40:10.559
for both of you guys.

40:10.561 --> 40:14.095
And that should help him to move on.

40:14.097 --> 40:18.966
Then, the next day, two
mediums need to come back,

40:18.968 --> 40:22.104
a male medium and a female medium.

40:22.106 --> 40:25.673
The female medium needs
to be really feminine.

40:25.675 --> 40:29.077
The male medium needs
to be pretty tough.

40:29.079 --> 40:31.113
Both of the mediums

40:31.115 --> 40:35.249
will engage with the guy in your bedroom

40:35.251 --> 40:39.955
and forcefully remove
him from the location.

40:39.957 --> 40:42.089
And his dead girlfriend will go with him

40:42.091 --> 40:43.624
because of their situation.

40:43.626 --> 40:47.928
So let me ask you a question.
Why a feminine woman?

40:47.930 --> 40:53.267
Because a feminine
woman would be, to him,

40:53.269 --> 40:56.303
someone that he could
dominate and possess

40:56.305 --> 40:58.405
because he views women as weak.

40:58.407 --> 41:01.309
Well, this has got to be good news.

41:01.311 --> 41:03.144
You told me you thought it was
a frigging demon in the house.

41:03.146 --> 41:04.479
Yeah, I'm glad it's not.

41:04.481 --> 41:07.117
Well, it's the next thing to a demon.

41:10.954 --> 41:13.687
I'm hoping that, once
all of this is out,

41:13.689 --> 41:16.957
that the family can come
back to where it was.

41:16.959 --> 41:20.294
Because it wasn't always a strain.

41:20.296 --> 41:23.164
It wasn't always chaos.
It wasn't always hateful.

41:23.166 --> 41:26.934
Are you gonna do what
Amy suggests you guys do?

41:26.936 --> 41:28.870
Yeah.

41:28.872 --> 41:30.174
Can't wait to start.

41:34.077 --> 41:36.278
If the family follows my advice,

41:36.280 --> 41:38.713
Deborah's dad will finally be free,

41:38.715 --> 41:41.682
and the evil man tormenting
the women of the house

41:41.684 --> 41:43.151
will be kicked out for good.

41:43.153 --> 41:44.785
Then this family will find

41:44.787 --> 41:46.356
the peace it's been searching for.
