17:57.952 --> 17:59.537
Why?

17:59.621 --> 18:01.790
We encountered countermeasures,
IEDs, near the access points.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.416
Comms down is S.O.P.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.335
Was there any sign that he had
even been to the compound?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.378
Can you point
to the area with the IEDs?

18:07.462 --> 18:08.880
QRF found
a mobile lab.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.632
Let's stick
with the op.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.134
Where were the IEDs located?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.433
Right here.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.018
If it was just IEDs,

18:22.101 --> 18:23.478
it'd be nothing
out of the ordinary,

18:23.561 --> 18:25.563
but there were armed loyalists
waiting to ambush us.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.398
They knew we were coming.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.442
Commander, at what point
of the operation

18:29.526 --> 18:33.279
did you notice that Special
Warfare Operator 2nd Class

18:33.363 --> 18:35.532
Donny Mitchell was unwell?

18:41.788 --> 18:43.498
Excuse me, what?

18:44.958 --> 18:48.044
SO2 Mitchell, the youngest
member of your troop,

18:48.127 --> 18:50.255
experienced some sort of
"episode" during the operation,

18:50.338 --> 18:52.674
shortly before he set off
the explosion.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.971
Gentlemen,

18:58.054 --> 19:00.640
you need
to understand something.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.184
I have 12 men flying home
in caskets right now,

19:03.268 --> 19:07.105
and you want to ask me
questions about Donny Mitchell?

19:08.690 --> 19:12.026
It was the SDF trooper
who panicked, not Donny.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.444
Our mission logs
say it was Donny Mitchell.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.655
No, it wasn't, okay?
I was there.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.532
- It wasn't Donny.
- Easy, Commander.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.284
We're just telling you
what we know.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.128
It's too loud, Boozer!
It's too fucking loud!

19:30.211 --> 19:31.880
Ramirez,
Donny needs help!

19:31.963 --> 19:33.882
Donny,
chill the fuck out!

19:33.965 --> 19:35.550
- Where the fuck is...
- Hey, Donny,
what's going on?

19:52.150 --> 19:53.985
That's not how it went down.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.239
I never said any
of those things.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.660
Maybe this interview
is too soon.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.746
- The Navy wanted us...
- All right, listen,
don't say Navy.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.372
All right? You're not Navy.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.416
You're fucking wannabe cops.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.669
I know how it went down.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.963
The place was packed with
explosives and armed loyalists,

20:14.047 --> 20:16.466
and our SDF trooper
lost his shit.

20:20.637 --> 20:22.305
It's too
fucking loud, Ramirez.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.140
- It's too fucking loud.
- Calm down, Donny.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.059
- Calm down!
- It's too
fucking loud, Ramirez.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.101
Donny, look at me.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.311
I'll get you out of here,
brother.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.563
I got you. I got you.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.193
All of the audio
indicates it was Mitchell

20:35.276 --> 20:38.154
that triggered the explosion.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.783
Please, take a moment,
review the logs.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.410
Then let us know if you want
to amend your statement.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.997
You're in good shape,
Commander,

20:48.081 --> 20:49.666
all things considered.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.794
Course he is, Doc.
Look at him.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.964
My men are built
to take a kick to the head.

20:56.047 --> 20:59.342
How are you feeling,
Commander, generally?

20:59.425 --> 21:03.554
Any blurry vision,
headaches, memory loss?

21:03.638 --> 21:05.431
Memory loss?

21:05.515 --> 21:08.351
With brain trauma, physical
injuries can heal quickly,

21:08.434 --> 21:10.645
neural pathways
may take more time.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.689
Add in the stress
of grief and loss...

21:12.772 --> 21:15.149
You experiencing
symptoms, Reece?

21:16.943 --> 21:19.320
No, sir. No.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.782
There are a few more tests
we can run.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.410
I'd really like to get
those done at Balboa, if I can.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.620
- I'd prefer to give you
an MRI here.
- Yeah.

21:27.704 --> 21:30.832
Well, my men already flew home.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.917
I'd like to get back
to their families.

21:34.919 --> 21:38.756
Unless you're grounding him,
I'm okay with Reece flying.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.801
WARCOM can coordinate
once he's stateside.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.305
Okay, Commander.

21:46.389 --> 21:50.059
But until your follow-up,
take it easy.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.061
Plenty of rest.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.521
No alcohol.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.199
We're gonna find Kahani.

22:10.872 --> 22:12.790
And when we do,
we're gonna scalp him.

22:12.874 --> 22:14.751
Fuckin' A.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.882
That's what Donny would've done.

22:20.965 --> 22:23.509
23-year-old kid
was a fucking savage.

22:31.559 --> 22:32.810
For Donny.

22:32.894 --> 22:35.438
Long live the brotherhood.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.200
Can I get a whiskey?
Neat.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.292
Who we drinking to?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.675
You a contractor or a reporter?

23:06.052 --> 23:07.595

23:07.678 --> 23:09.263

service members in there.

23:09.347 --> 23:10.973

23:12.266 --> 23:14.393
I mean, I was there
with an airman.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.812
He told me about a transport

23:15.895 --> 23:19.524
that flew out last night
carrying 12 SEALs.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.527
No color guard,
no ramp ceremony.
