WEBVTT

00:08.312 --> 00:10.053
[brakes squeak]

00:13.665 --> 00:15.145
Turn your damn headlights off.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.496
Sarge?

00:19.497 --> 00:21.064
Yeah, I see it.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.893
[intercom beeps]Dim your headlights.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.379
Bravo six Romeo.

00:31.422 --> 00:34.686
We got a possible level three.
Going to confirm. Over.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.211
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:45.741 --> 00:47.438
That Sergeant Bly?

00:48.265 --> 00:50.789
Sergeant, there a problem?

00:52.704 --> 00:54.445
Sergeant?

00:56.317 --> 00:58.362
Sergeant, what are you doing?

00:59.798 --> 01:01.191
He's got a weapon.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.150
Put the weapon on the dash. Now!

01:04.151 --> 01:05.282
Now!

01:14.030 --> 01:16.989
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.777
Oh, my God,

01:21.820 --> 01:23.126
Bly, what happened?

01:27.304 --> 01:29.480
[helicopter passing][distant whistle blows]

01:29.524 --> 01:31.439
Jason. Thanks for coming.

01:31.482 --> 01:34.398
Of course, Victor.
This is Chester Palmer,

01:34.442 --> 01:36.661
our lead counsel at TAC.How are you, sir?

01:36.705 --> 01:38.794
This is
Colonel Victor Taggart,

01:38.837 --> 01:40.709
one of the finest psychiatrists

01:40.752 --> 01:42.276
the U.S. Army has to offer.

01:42.319 --> 01:45.670
Also one of the very few
psychiatrists in the U.S. Army.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.107
Jason's been ragging me

01:47.150 --> 01:49.239
for 15 years about headshrinking
for the Army.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.675
It's true

01:50.719 --> 01:52.286
that therapy is not as
popular in military circles

01:52.329 --> 01:53.896
as I'd like, but
I feel confident

01:53.939 --> 01:55.767
we can turn that around.

01:55.811 --> 01:58.118
In another generation or two.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.163
[chuckles]What's going on?

02:01.730 --> 02:03.862
I run a unit here
that treats soldiers

02:03.906 --> 02:06.735
dealing with trauma suffered
during deployment.

02:06.778 --> 02:09.825
PTSD's epidemic,
as you can imagine.

02:09.868 --> 02:12.958
One of my patients
was just charged with murder.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.873
Name's Sergeant Carter Bly.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.137
Colonel, if this involves

02:17.180 --> 02:18.616
a military court
proceeding,

02:18.660 --> 02:20.314
I'm not sure that TAC
is the right fit for you.

02:20.357 --> 02:22.533
It happened off base
under civilian authority.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.056
And before you ask,

02:24.100 --> 02:27.016
Bly waived confidentiality,
so no HIPAA issues.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.322
So, what happened?

02:28.365 --> 02:30.846
He confessed to killing
another soldier.

02:30.889 --> 02:33.936
Sergeant Nathan Wells.
They were friends.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.069
Best friends.

02:37.113 --> 02:39.420
He confessed.
Did he give a reason?

02:39.463 --> 02:40.943
There is no reason.

02:40.986 --> 02:43.075
That's why you're here.

02:45.904 --> 02:48.037
BLY:
I've known Nathan
since high school.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.343
Day after graduation,

02:49.386 --> 02:51.823
he drove us
to the recruiting station.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.871
I was hesitant.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.264
But Nathan walked right up
to the recruiter

02:57.307 --> 02:59.831
and said he was there
to serve his country.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.224
That's how he was.

03:01.268 --> 03:04.009
He didn't like talking
about a thing.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.534
He'd just do it.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.362
[clears throat]

03:09.754 --> 03:11.713
You need to take a moment?

03:11.756 --> 03:14.150
[sniffles]
No, sir.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.283
Nathan and I did basic together,

03:16.326 --> 03:18.894
one tour in Iraq,
two in Afghanistan.

03:18.937 --> 03:21.592
What happened the night
that Sergeant Wells died?

03:21.636 --> 03:23.072
We were hanging out

03:23.115 --> 03:25.074
in Pelham Bay Park.

03:25.117 --> 03:27.511
Used to go there
when we were kids.

03:27.555 --> 03:28.730
What were you doing there?

03:28.773 --> 03:31.559
Drinking beers. You know.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.300
Hanging out.

03:34.605 --> 03:39.131
Then a vehicle backfired.

03:40.045 --> 03:42.222
Came out of nowhere.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.485
It was loud.

03:45.486 --> 03:46.878
Next thing I know,

03:46.922 --> 03:48.532
I'm standing over Nathan
with a gun in my hand.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.142
Whose was it? Yours?

03:50.186 --> 03:51.274
No, sir.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.668
It was Nathan's.
He always had it on him.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.452
Well, how did you get it?

03:55.496 --> 03:57.715
I must have grabbed it.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.717
Why do that?

04:01.806 --> 04:03.591
I don't remember.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.114
It's all right, Carter.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.290
In therapy, I've learned
that when I dissociate,

04:07.334 --> 04:10.119
I'm in
a fight-or-flight mentality.

04:10.162 --> 04:13.818
I could've thought Nathan
was trying to kill me or...

04:13.862 --> 04:16.473
I don't know. Anything, really.

04:16.517 --> 04:19.171
I just don't know.

04:19.998 --> 04:22.479
Nathan was like family to me.

04:23.350 --> 04:26.266
Last thing I wanted to do
was hurt him.

04:34.186 --> 04:38.147
[sighs] I've been seeing these
kind of cases more and more.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.976
Soldiers experiencing
PTSD episodes,

04:41.019 --> 04:43.370
coupled with
dissociative disorders.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.502
Bly's case is more
severe than most,

04:45.546 --> 04:49.332
but the experience he's
describing isn't unique.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.552
It's not even
all that unusual.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.380
Can you help him?

04:53.423 --> 04:55.991
Colonel, even
with Sergeant Bly's illness,

04:56.034 --> 04:57.166
if we take his case,

04:57.209 --> 04:59.386
we'd strongly recommend
a plea deal.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.344
Plead guilty? Why?

05:01.388 --> 05:03.215
Well, because he did it

05:03.259 --> 05:04.695
and because
he confessed to it

05:04.739 --> 05:06.523
and I see no other credible way
to argue it.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.352
He wasn't in
his right mind.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.529
Come on.

05:12.573 --> 05:14.139
If there was

05:14.183 --> 05:17.012
ever a case to argue
diminished capacity, this is it.

05:17.055 --> 05:19.841
[sighs]
Vic, the insanity defense

05:19.884 --> 05:21.843
is only used
in about one percent

05:21.886 --> 05:23.845
of cases, and even then,
it's only successful

05:23.888 --> 05:26.195
25% of the time.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.545
Juries don't like saying someone

05:28.589 --> 05:30.504
isn't responsible
for something they clearly did.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.332
But he wasn't responsible.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.334
Jason, the U.S.
military takes

05:34.377 --> 05:36.118
healthy young men and women
straight out of high school

05:36.161 --> 05:37.902
and ships them off
to the battlefield.

05:37.946 --> 05:40.252
And when they come back
emotionally damaged,

05:40.296 --> 05:42.690
soldiers like Bly
who seek treatment

05:42.733 --> 05:44.518
get stigmatized.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.215
Their careers stall out.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.739
Now, there's a number of us
who are trying to change that,

05:48.783 --> 05:52.526
but shifting institutionalized
norms takes time.BULL: Okay.

05:52.569 --> 05:53.788
We do understand that.

05:53.831 --> 05:56.268
Bly's condition
is not his fault.

05:56.312 --> 05:59.924
It's a result
of his service to this country.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.362
There's no way on earth

06:02.405 --> 06:04.146
that that young man
should go to prison.

06:04.189 --> 06:07.410
And you're willing to
testify to that in court?

06:08.280 --> 06:11.066
Absolutely. And all day long.CHUNK:
Bull, look,

06:11.109 --> 06:13.111
I just have to say
that if we plead this out,

06:13.155 --> 06:14.591
Bly is looking

06:14.635 --> 06:16.114
at a reduced sentence.
Maybe as little as five years.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.421
But if we take this to trial,
all that is

06:18.465 --> 06:20.989
out the window.
He's looking at 20, minimum.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.295
There's a ton of downside
if we lose.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.475
Well, then I guess
we're gonna have to win.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.781
â™ª

06:37.962 --> 06:39.964
Mm. Did your super fix
that leaky sink yet?

06:40.008 --> 06:42.097
He said he's waiting
on a part to come in.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.099
They don't take that long.
I'll go talk to him.

06:44.142 --> 06:48.016
Dad, my apartment,
my sink, my problem.

06:48.059 --> 06:51.236
I know. I'm just saying I don't
want him brushing you off.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.152
Want one of these?
I'll finish this stack.No, thanks.

06:54.196 --> 06:55.719
I'm starting a new trial today,

06:55.763 --> 06:58.809
and I never know if I'm gonna
have enough time to eat lunch.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.332
About the trial...Oh,

07:00.376 --> 07:02.552
I read that story that you wrote
about the, um...

07:02.596 --> 07:04.032
the, uh, pigeon

07:04.075 --> 07:05.947
and the dog. [laughs]
It was hilarious.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.557
It was a puff piece.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.907
No, it was funny. It made me
smile. That's not nothing.

07:09.951 --> 07:12.780
Dad, I need to talk to...I know you want to be doing
more compelling,

07:12.823 --> 07:14.303
hard-hitting journalism,
but you've only been

07:14.346 --> 07:16.479
at BANG Online
for, what, a few months?

07:16.523 --> 07:18.133
You got to pay your dues, kid.

07:18.176 --> 07:20.396
My editor asked me
to cover your trial.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.442
What?

07:24.400 --> 07:25.967
The Fort Dryer murder.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.317
My editor asked me
to write a story on it.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.623
That's...

07:29.666 --> 07:32.103
[sighs]
Anna, that's...

07:32.147 --> 07:33.496
What?

07:33.540 --> 07:35.977
You don't think I can
handle the story.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.719
No, I didn't say that.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.895
But you go
from writing animal stories

07:40.938 --> 07:42.853
one week to covering
a high-profile murder

07:42.897 --> 07:44.942
the next?I've been working really hard.

07:44.986 --> 07:47.379
I know you have.

07:47.423 --> 07:48.685
But your editor knows

07:48.729 --> 07:51.166
that I'm representing
the defendant, right?

07:52.428 --> 07:54.125
Yes.Mm-hmm.

07:54.169 --> 07:56.388
He thinks that you're
gonna be able to hit me up

07:56.432 --> 07:57.955
for information, Anna.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.348
He's taking advantage of you.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.176
This is my shot, Dad.

08:01.219 --> 08:03.395
And okay.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.485
Maybe it did come a little early
because

08:05.528 --> 08:07.661
my editor thinks that
I have an in with you.

08:07.704 --> 08:10.925
But I promise I'm not gonna
ask you for any favors.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.189
I'm writing this story.

08:14.232 --> 08:17.627
Well, if you are going to do
this, then you have to know

08:17.671 --> 08:20.282
you and I are gonna have to keep
things completely separate.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.676
I'm talking
church and state separate.

08:22.719 --> 08:25.548
Well, I'd argue that the church

08:25.592 --> 08:26.984
influenced the state
quite a bit...Anna.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.900
Church and state. Got it.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.862
Good. You're both here.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.690
We need to start digging
on the Fort Dryer case.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.343
Already started.

08:38.387 --> 08:41.085
This is so sad. I've been
digging through their socials.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.783
These guys did
everything together.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.393
How do you get over

08:44.436 --> 08:46.047
killing your best friend?DANNY:
Well, the fact

08:46.090 --> 08:47.918
that they were so close,
that has to be good for us,

08:47.962 --> 08:49.920
right? There's no motive
for the prosecutor to point to.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.618
Well, technically,
the prosecution

08:51.661 --> 08:53.097
doesn't need motive
to prove murder,

08:53.141 --> 08:54.925
but the lack of one
certainly helps us.

08:54.969 --> 08:55.970
So, Taylor,
stay on their relationship.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.014
That is our offense.

08:57.058 --> 08:59.060
Danny, you're on defense.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.061
Which is?

09:00.104 --> 09:01.453
PTSD.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.020
Colonel Taggart will testify
as an expert witness,

09:03.064 --> 09:04.587
but it would be great
if we could find anyone

09:04.631 --> 09:05.936
who has witnessed
Bly experiencing

09:05.980 --> 09:07.547
a PTSD episode.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.505
DANNY:
I'm on it.Marissa?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.246
Henri.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.074
I'm sorry to interrupt.MARISSA:Uh, no.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.423
Uh, perfect timing.
I'll check in

09:14.466 --> 09:15.903
with you two later.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.603
Who's the hot French guy?

09:20.647 --> 09:21.735
No clue.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.475
Go, Marissa.

09:24.476 --> 09:25.956
It's perfect.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.306
It fits the space quite well.Thank you for bringing it.

09:28.350 --> 09:31.222
I doubt most gallery owners
would take the trouble

09:31.266 --> 09:33.137
to install
their clients' artwork.

09:33.181 --> 09:36.097
Well, most of my clients don't
spend months visiting the piece

09:36.140 --> 09:37.751
before they make
the purchase.

09:37.794 --> 09:40.275
I wanted to be sure
that you were certain.[exhales]

09:40.318 --> 09:42.756
I was certain
the moment I laid eyes on it.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.714
I just...

09:44.758 --> 09:46.716
needed to earn it.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.545
Well,
she was meant for you.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.938
This may sound silly,

09:50.981 --> 09:54.637
but I do believe in
a spiritual connection with art.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.378
Well, I hope it's not silly.

09:56.421 --> 09:58.467
It's been the guiding principle
of my life.

09:58.510 --> 10:00.948
[chuckles]

10:02.471 --> 10:04.342
Uh, this is a law firm, no?

10:04.386 --> 10:06.997
Uh, not exactly. We're
a trial science company.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.478
Ah.We consult on legal cases
before they go

10:09.521 --> 10:11.523
to trial.Ah.

10:11.567 --> 10:16.180
Why? Do you need a lawyer?I could use a little legal
consultation, perhaps.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.966
Have a seat.
Let me see if I can help.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.838
I do some work

10:21.882 --> 10:23.492
with a nonprofit
that attempts to repatriate

10:23.535 --> 10:25.537
art and antiquities
to their countries of origin,

10:25.581 --> 10:28.802
and we recently identified
a centuries-old tribal mask

10:28.845 --> 10:29.977
that was stolen
from the Guro people

10:30.020 --> 10:31.587
off the Ivory Coast.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.459
Unfortunately, the item is
about to go up for auction

10:34.503 --> 10:35.809
here in New York,

10:35.852 --> 10:37.506
and we won't have
the official chain of title

10:37.549 --> 10:38.725
for a couple of weeks.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.640
And once the piece is sold,
it...

10:40.683 --> 10:42.903
it could disappear forever.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.079
Have you explained the situation

10:45.122 --> 10:46.210
to the auction house?

10:46.254 --> 10:47.821
Without proof of provenance,

10:47.864 --> 10:49.692
auctioneers
tend to be dismissive

10:49.736 --> 10:50.693
of these claims.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.522
But I thought I could stall

10:53.565 --> 10:55.045
with the threat of legal action?

10:55.872 --> 10:57.700
Our in-house counsel

10:57.744 --> 10:59.180
is in the middle
of trial right now,

10:59.223 --> 11:02.879
but I might be able
to scare them a little.

11:05.055 --> 11:09.059
Nathan was incredibly proud
to serve in the military,

11:09.103 --> 11:13.194
to be a role model
to our five-year-old son, Jack.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.978
You must have been proud
of him, too.

11:15.022 --> 11:18.199
Absolutely. Proud and
sometimes worried.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.201
I said a lot of
prayers when Nathan

11:20.244 --> 11:22.246
was deployed,
but I never thought

11:22.290 --> 11:24.596
that he would be killed at home

11:24.640 --> 11:27.208
by one of his
fellow soldiers.

11:27.251 --> 11:30.211
I know this is tough, but
you got to look at her.

11:30.254 --> 11:33.214
THOMAS:
Mrs. Wells, are you aware

11:33.257 --> 11:34.694
that the defendant
claims he was suffering

11:34.737 --> 11:37.740
from a PTSD blackout
when he shot your husband?

11:37.784 --> 11:41.178
Yes. But I don't believe
that for a second.CHUNK: Objection.

11:41.222 --> 11:44.834
The witness is not an expert on
post-traumatic stress disorder.THOMAS: Your Honor,

11:44.878 --> 11:46.618
the defense has stated
that Sergeant Bly

11:46.662 --> 11:47.968
and Sergeant Wells
were best friends.

11:48.011 --> 11:50.753
Spent lots of time together.
Mrs. Wells

11:50.797 --> 11:51.928
is qualified

11:51.972 --> 11:53.103
to speak to her own observations

11:53.147 --> 11:54.452
of the defendant's behavior

11:54.496 --> 11:56.977
and motives.I agree. Overruled.

11:57.020 --> 12:00.284
But keep it within her purview,
Counselor.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.417
Mrs. Wells,

12:02.460 --> 12:04.898
why don't you believe

12:04.941 --> 12:06.769
the defendant's story?

12:06.813 --> 12:10.817
I'm not saying Sergeant
Bly didn't have problems

12:10.860 --> 12:13.080
when he got back from
his last deployment,

12:13.123 --> 12:16.953
but I've been around him
plenty, and I've never seen him

12:16.997 --> 12:19.260
black out or lose control.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.044
My husband did
just as many tours as him,

12:21.088 --> 12:23.438
and he never would've flipped
out and killed somebody.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.483
Objection--
inflammatory and irrelevant.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.268
Sergeant Wells'
mental health has absolutely

12:27.311 --> 12:28.835
no bearing on this case.

12:28.878 --> 12:31.185
NAUMANN:
We have gone
a little out of bounds.

12:31.228 --> 12:32.752
The jury will disregard

12:32.795 --> 12:35.580
the witness's
last statement.

12:35.624 --> 12:39.933
THOMAS: In the weeks leading
up to your husband's death,

12:39.976 --> 12:42.631
did you have any reason
to believe that he

12:42.674 --> 12:44.938
and Sergeant Bly were not
on friendly terms?

12:44.981 --> 12:46.287
Yes.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.593
Things had been tense
between them.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.944
Ever since Nathan got back

12:50.987 --> 12:52.510
from his last tour.

12:52.554 --> 12:55.252
And a few nights before

12:55.296 --> 12:57.646
Nathan was killed...

12:57.689 --> 13:00.736
the two of them were arguing out
on our driveway.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.957
For ages.Did you hear what they were
arguing about?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.003
No, at least not
all of it, but...

13:07.047 --> 13:09.789
at one point Carter...

13:09.832 --> 13:11.573
Sergeant Bly...

13:11.616 --> 13:13.531
got up in Nathan's face

13:13.575 --> 13:15.620
and I heard him
yell that...

13:15.664 --> 13:17.927
he would do whatever it took
to stop him.

13:17.971 --> 13:20.016
Did you ask your husband
what they were fighting about?

13:20.060 --> 13:22.105
He said it had to do

13:22.149 --> 13:23.367
with Afghanistan.
[sniffles]

13:23.411 --> 13:24.847
But he couldn't talk about it.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.371
As in, it involved some kind
of military secret?

13:27.415 --> 13:28.938
TRISH:That's how I
understood it.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.853
Yes.Do you think that
Sergeant Bly

13:30.897 --> 13:32.463
killed your husband
to prevent him

13:32.507 --> 13:34.335
from revealing something
that happened overseas?

13:34.378 --> 13:35.597
Objection, Your Honor!

13:35.640 --> 13:37.294
This is gross speculation!Sustained.

13:37.338 --> 13:40.341
The jury will disregard
A.D.A. Thomas's

13:40.384 --> 13:41.603
conjecture.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.518
Dial it back, Ms. Thomas.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.563
No further questions,
Your Honor.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.957
What happened
in Afghanistan?

13:48.001 --> 13:49.524
Nothing.

13:49.567 --> 13:50.873
I don't know
what she's talking about.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.310
Then what were you
fighting about?

13:54.964 --> 13:57.140
BULL:
Sergeant?

13:58.446 --> 14:00.100
He signed up for another tour.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.580
I didn't think
he should do it.Why not?

14:04.060 --> 14:07.107
I remember the toll
my last tour had on me.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.891
Nathan had a wife.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.110
A son.

14:10.153 --> 14:11.415
Had more at stake.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.374
I was concerned about him.

14:13.417 --> 14:16.072
Well, to the jury,

14:16.116 --> 14:17.857
that concern...

14:17.900 --> 14:19.641
looks like motive.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.905
Hey, Vic,
how you doing?

14:23.950 --> 14:25.429
I hope you don't mind.

14:25.473 --> 14:26.735
They told me you were
on your way back from court,

14:26.778 --> 14:27.823
and it was okay
for me to wait here.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.260
Oh, what's going on?

14:31.653 --> 14:33.698
Jason, I can't testify.

14:36.136 --> 14:37.789
What are you talking about?

14:37.833 --> 14:39.748
I had to ask permission
to testify,

14:39.791 --> 14:42.751
which I assumed would be
pro forma.

14:42.794 --> 14:45.058
I didn't know
the classification status

14:45.101 --> 14:46.668
of Bly's deployments.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.061
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

14:48.104 --> 14:49.889
Some of the operations
that Bly took part in are

14:49.932 --> 14:52.587
highly classified.
My superiors are

14:52.630 --> 14:55.068
concerned that details
could leak if I testify,

14:55.111 --> 14:57.026
so they have ordered me not to.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.376
Ignore them.I can't do that.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.769
Yes, you can!

15:00.812 --> 15:02.423
Or quit the Army.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.860
So you don't have to take
these asinine orders.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.428
The military is my life--
I know you don't get that.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.256
Without your testimony,
Bly is doing 50 years.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.605
You get that.

15:10.648 --> 15:11.867
Right?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.434
I'm gonna subpoena you

15:13.477 --> 15:16.002
and Bly's records and I'm
gonna put it all out in public.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.568
You can try. It won't work.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.266
You brought me into this.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.094
You put me on this mission.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.443
I know.And now you're saying

15:22.486 --> 15:24.662
that the Army told you
to walk away?

15:26.490 --> 15:29.015
I was wrong to assume
that I could help this soldier

15:29.058 --> 15:30.277
just because I'm treating him.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.627
I can't, Jason.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.806
So you're telling Bly?

15:37.849 --> 15:40.113
I already have.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.941
He understands.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.986
"He understands."

15:44.030 --> 15:45.466
Hmm.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.294
He understands
that his therapist

15:47.337 --> 15:49.209
just hung him out to dry?

15:50.514 --> 15:53.169
When you're a soldier,
you're a soldier first.

15:53.213 --> 15:55.737
Well, congratulations, soldier.

15:55.780 --> 15:59.175
You just left
one of your own behind.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.275
MARISSA:
You're selling stolen goods.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.668
Show me the paperwork
that says someone else

16:13.711 --> 16:15.757
owns this,
and they can have it back.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.019
Until then...

16:17.063 --> 16:18.455
I can't help you.

16:18.499 --> 16:19.804
We will have the provenance
document shortly.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.284
It would be in
your best interest

16:21.328 --> 16:22.590
to pull the mask

16:22.633 --> 16:23.895
from the auction in the interim.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.462
No, it would be
in my best interest

16:25.506 --> 16:27.029
to sell it and make a profit.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.989
And risk losing a crucial piece
of the Guro people's

16:30.032 --> 16:31.033
cultural historyforever.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.470
No offense, but I get people

16:33.514 --> 16:35.385
making claims on art
all the time.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.692
Hmm.If I held up every auction

16:37.735 --> 16:38.954
without proof...

16:38.998 --> 16:41.174
I'd be out of business.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.533
Let's focus on the stolen mask.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.970
I am prepared to file
a Writ of Replevin

16:55.014 --> 16:57.364
to return this property
to its rightful owner.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.888
What law firm
did you say you're from?

16:59.931 --> 17:02.195
Trial Analysis Corporation.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.588
Hmm. May I see your card?

17:10.420 --> 17:12.988
There's no "esquire"
after you're name.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.599
You're not even
a lawyer, are you?

17:17.166 --> 17:18.907
I represent the interests...

17:18.950 --> 17:20.822
Okay, look, I have

17:20.865 --> 17:22.258
an auction in two days.

17:22.302 --> 17:23.999
Unless I get clear provenance

17:24.043 --> 17:25.348
before then, this piece

17:25.392 --> 17:27.307
will be listed.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.091
Have a nice day.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.832
[car horn honking]

17:30.875 --> 17:34.183
God, that man, I want to slap
the nice day right out of him.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.794
You have a temper, too?

17:36.838 --> 17:38.405
But you know
how to keep yours in check.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.059
I shouldn't have
needled him like that.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.408
He deserved it.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.757
You'd think someone
who worked with art

17:42.800 --> 17:44.454
would appreciate its
cultural significance.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.413
Oh, well, you know,
most people don't appreciate

17:46.456 --> 17:48.502
that spiritual connection
you spoke of.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.112
But thanks for trying.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.201
Oh, no, no, we're not done.

17:52.245 --> 17:53.768
We're not?Not by a long shot.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.552
Look, I may not have
"esquire" after my name,

17:55.596 --> 17:57.902
but I love a good fight.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.731
Our whole case is PTSD.

18:00.775 --> 18:02.994
If Taggart doesn't testify,
we have no case.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.127
Sorry I'm late.
I had a thing before work.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.998
So Taggert is still a no-go?

18:07.042 --> 18:08.261
Yeah.Do you think

18:08.304 --> 18:09.827
the Army is muscling him
to cover up

18:09.871 --> 18:12.003
something that went bad
over in Afghanistan?

18:12.047 --> 18:13.396
I could do some digging.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.355
See if there's anything to that.BULL: No.

18:15.398 --> 18:16.791
Frankly,
I don't want to find out

18:16.834 --> 18:18.271
that Bly had a motive
to cover up something

18:18.314 --> 18:20.447
that happened
over there.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.405
The only place
that leads is premeditation

18:22.449 --> 18:24.320
and a murder conviction.

18:24.364 --> 18:27.149
Okay, then what's our plan B?

18:27.193 --> 18:28.890
Plan B is...

18:28.933 --> 18:31.153
plan A-- PTSD.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.546
We need to find
a new expert

18:32.589 --> 18:34.504
who can get up there
and testify.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.463
Let these jurors know
what it's like

18:36.506 --> 18:38.769
to have
a dissociative experience.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.597
But a new expert is not gonna
understand Bly's history.

18:40.641 --> 18:43.513
Which is why it is more
important than ever that we find

18:43.557 --> 18:45.863
somebody from Bly's past
who has witnessed

18:45.907 --> 18:47.691
one of these PTSD events.

18:47.735 --> 18:49.606
How's Danny coming
with all that?

18:49.650 --> 18:51.608
I don't think
it's going well.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.219
She hasn't even been
able to get on the base

18:53.262 --> 18:55.003
to talk to Bly's
fellow soldiers.

18:55.046 --> 18:57.136
Well, she needs to figure out
a way to talk to them off base.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.572
[gunshot]

19:00.051 --> 19:01.836
[empty shells clanging]

19:11.541 --> 19:13.369
Damn. You're all right.

19:13.413 --> 19:15.850
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

19:15.893 --> 19:17.286
My dad.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.375
He was in the Army
and gone a lot.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.247
When he was around,

19:21.290 --> 19:22.770
I wanted to hang out with him.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.728
If that meant learning
how to shoot a gun,

19:24.772 --> 19:26.034
that's what I did.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.383
You ever think
of joining?

19:27.427 --> 19:28.950
Thought about it.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.039
My dad really struggled
when he got back.

19:31.082 --> 19:33.215
PTSD, you know.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.043
It happens.

19:35.086 --> 19:38.568
I read it just happened over
at Fort Dryer.

19:38.612 --> 19:41.354
One soldier shot another
off base.

19:41.397 --> 19:44.052
They're saying
it's PTSD-related.

19:44.095 --> 19:46.185
You know either of those guys?

19:46.228 --> 19:48.230
Yeah, I knew both of them.

19:48.274 --> 19:51.364
The, um, the shooter, was it
Sergeant Bly, I think?

19:51.407 --> 19:53.670
You really think
he had PTSD?Yeah.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.890
He seemed pretty messed up
since his last deployment.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.892
You ever see him have,
like, an episode or anything?

19:57.935 --> 19:59.676
What are you asking
about Bly for?

20:00.503 --> 20:02.462
Just making conversation.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.246
You a cop or something?

20:04.290 --> 20:06.944
What?You know Bly's trial's
going on right now.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.903
You working for him?

20:08.946 --> 20:10.078
For Bly?

20:10.121 --> 20:11.340
Working for him...?

20:11.384 --> 20:13.560
We got nothing
to say to you, lady.

20:13.603 --> 20:16.476
Come on.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.608
Get her out of here.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.567
Sorry, ma'am,
but you're gonna have to leave.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.264
I'm just trying
to get some range time in.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.831
You're upsetting my customers.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.267
I'm just making
friendly conversation.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.964
This way.

20:35.799 --> 20:38.193
Do you happen
to know Sergeant Bly?

20:38.237 --> 20:40.500
Friendly conversation,my ass.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.328
Listen, the guy's on trial
for his life.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.807
I work for his defense team.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.983
The Army won't let me on base
to talk to anyone, so...

20:46.027 --> 20:48.247
Anyone on base talks about
Bly, they'll catch hell.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.466
Yeah, but you're
not from base.

20:51.989 --> 20:53.817
Not anymore.

20:53.861 --> 20:54.992
Retired.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.212
Right, so no one can
give you hell anymore.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.390
Bly liked to come here.

21:01.434 --> 21:03.523
We talked sometimes.

21:03.566 --> 21:06.787
Things weren't so easy for me
when I came home, either.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.746
Did he ever talk to you
about his PTSD?

21:09.790 --> 21:10.921
Some. Yeah.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.314
He had it pretty rough.

21:12.358 --> 21:15.361
Bly said that he suffered
from, um, blackouts.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.450
Did you ever see
anything like that?

21:17.493 --> 21:20.322
Last fall a group of us
got together in the park

21:20.366 --> 21:22.063
for a birthday; some kids

21:22.106 --> 21:23.238
were playing
with bang snaps.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.326
One of them threw a handful,

21:24.370 --> 21:25.675
sounded like...

21:25.719 --> 21:27.982
automatic weapon fire and...

21:28.025 --> 21:29.723
Bly totally lost it.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.116
Would you be willing
to testify to that?

21:32.160 --> 21:34.467
Don't need to.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.340
I can show you.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.087
[loud popping]Take cover!

21:46.130 --> 21:48.524
Did he just tackle a little boy?

21:48.568 --> 21:50.526
Nearly broke the kid's arm.

21:53.050 --> 21:55.226
CHUNK: Sergeant Bly, do
you have an explanation

21:55.270 --> 21:57.707
for what we just
saw in that video?

21:58.882 --> 22:01.189
Ever since
my second tour of duty,

22:01.232 --> 22:03.931
I've suffered from severe PTSD.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.760
I won't sleep for days.

22:06.803 --> 22:08.805
If I do...

22:08.849 --> 22:10.851
I get night terrors.

22:10.894 --> 22:13.027
And I get bad panic attacks
sometimes.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.420
If I get triggered,

22:14.463 --> 22:16.160
like with the fireworks
in that video,

22:16.204 --> 22:18.380
I black out completely.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.295
My psychiatrist says
the official term

22:20.339 --> 22:21.775
is a dissociative event.

22:21.818 --> 22:24.430
And is that what happened
the night that you shot

22:24.473 --> 22:26.214
Sergeant Wells?

22:26.257 --> 22:27.998
Did you have
a dissociative event?

22:28.042 --> 22:29.217
BLY:
Yes, sir.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.479
My best guess is...

22:30.523 --> 22:32.655
I was triggered
by a car backfiring.

22:32.699 --> 22:35.049
CHUNK:
Sergeant Bly, did you have any

22:35.092 --> 22:37.486
animus toward Sergeant Wells?I think you should see this.

22:37.530 --> 22:40.054
Any reason to want him dead?No.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.403
He was my friend.

22:41.447 --> 22:44.363
Trish Wells
testified earlier that...

22:44.406 --> 22:46.365
that you and her husband
were fighting

22:46.408 --> 22:48.454
just days before he died.

22:48.497 --> 22:50.543
Isn't that correct?We were arguing.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.806
But we're friends.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.547
Sometimes friends argue.

22:54.590 --> 22:56.157
Look...

22:56.200 --> 22:58.420
Nathan was more than a friend.

22:58.464 --> 23:01.292
He was like a brother to me.

23:02.468 --> 23:05.296
I had absolutely
no desire to kill him.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.211
Thank you, Sergeant Bly.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.561
No further questions,
Your Honor.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.519
We are winning
some hearts and minds, Bull.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.260
Let's see how well
Sergeant Bly holds up

23:12.303 --> 23:14.305
on cross
before we pop the champagne.

23:14.349 --> 23:16.438
Sergeant Bly,
have you ever stayed

23:16.482 --> 23:19.267
at the Stone Valley Motel?CHUNK: Objection.

23:19.310 --> 23:20.442
Relevance?THOMAS: Your Honor,

23:20.486 --> 23:21.748
I assure you
this is relevant.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.445
It'll take me just
a moment to get there.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.795
Sergeant Bly,
you will answer the question.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.929
I'm not sure.

23:28.972 --> 23:31.105
I don't recall every...

23:31.148 --> 23:33.455
motel I've ever stayed in.Where is this going?

23:33.499 --> 23:34.761
I don't know.Let me see
if I can jog your memory.

23:34.804 --> 23:37.503
An article was published
on BANG Online today

23:37.546 --> 23:40.462
stating that you were
a guest at Stone Valley Motel

23:40.506 --> 23:44.466
on September 5 of this year.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.816
Did you stay the night
at the motel?

23:50.124 --> 23:51.473
[quietly]:
Yeah.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.954
Uh, the court didn't hear you,

23:53.997 --> 23:55.434
Sergeant Bly.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.045
Yes. I was there.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.394
Did a woman

23:59.438 --> 24:01.483
spend the night
in your room with you?

24:07.097 --> 24:08.098
Yes.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.578
Who was that woman?

24:09.622 --> 24:11.145
[sighs]

24:11.188 --> 24:12.320
Trish Wells.

24:12.363 --> 24:13.626
[gallery murmuring]

24:13.669 --> 24:15.584
THOMAS:
You had an affair
with Trish Wells,

24:15.628 --> 24:17.847
the wife of Sergeant Wells?

24:17.891 --> 24:19.501
The man you claim

24:19.545 --> 24:21.242
was like a brother to you?

24:21.285 --> 24:23.549
I should've never let it happen.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.986
When I came back
from my last tour,

24:26.029 --> 24:27.901
I was having
a hard time.

24:27.944 --> 24:30.469
I just needed someone
to talk to.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.688
Nathan was overseas.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.083
Trish and I were there
for each other.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.650
THOMAS:
Is that why

24:37.693 --> 24:39.739
you killed Sergeant Wells,
so you could have his wife

24:39.782 --> 24:41.088
for yourself?CHUNK: Objection.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.393
Inflammatory, Your Honor.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.439
Overruled. Sergeant Bly will

24:44.483 --> 24:45.788
answer the question.

24:45.832 --> 24:50.227
BLY:
No. We ended things months ago.

24:50.271 --> 24:51.533
The shooting had
nothing to do with Trish.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.013
Don't bring her into this.

24:53.056 --> 24:54.623
Well, I didn't bring her
into this, Sergeant.

24:54.667 --> 24:55.755
You did.

24:55.798 --> 24:58.453
No further questions,
Your Honor.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.150
Ask for a recess.CHUNK: Your Honor?

25:00.194 --> 25:01.978
The defense requests
a short recess

25:02.022 --> 25:03.850
before we redirect.

25:05.155 --> 25:07.549
ANNA:
No, no, no, he admitted it
on the stand.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.551
All of it now. The whole thing.CHUNK: Anna!

25:09.595 --> 25:11.031
I need to talk to you.Yeah.

25:11.074 --> 25:13.033
Now!

25:13.076 --> 25:14.904
You'll have my copy by 4:00.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.384
Thanks, bye.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.429
That was my editor, Dad.

25:18.473 --> 25:19.953
I don't interrupt you
when you're in court.

25:19.996 --> 25:21.171
You blindsided me in there.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.521
That article
you wrote

25:22.564 --> 25:23.739
blew up our whole defense.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.393
You could've given me
a heads-up.

25:25.436 --> 25:26.829
You didn't want me asking you
for favors,

25:26.873 --> 25:28.570
but I'm supposed to tip you off
about a scoop?

25:28.614 --> 25:30.572
It's called
professional courtesy, Anna.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.531
Church and state, remember?

25:33.880 --> 25:37.187
You're just mad that I found
something that your team didn't.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.928
When you didn't even think
I could handle this case.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.060
I never said that.

25:40.103 --> 25:42.323
You didn't have to.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.413
Look, I didn't mean
to blow up your case.

25:45.456 --> 25:47.850
I found a lead
and I followed it.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.591
All right, okay.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.158
You want to be a professional?

25:51.201 --> 25:53.290
I'm gonna treat you
like one.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.597
I'm adding you
to our witness list.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.991
What? Why?

26:00.080 --> 26:01.603
Wait, no,
if I'm on the witness list,

26:01.647 --> 26:03.779
I-I'll be under a gag order.
I can't write my story!

26:03.823 --> 26:06.042
Yeah, that's right.

26:08.828 --> 26:10.873
Welcome to the big leagues.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.094
Well, I think it would've
been better for us to know

26:14.137 --> 26:15.617
that you were having an affair
with Sergeant Wells' wife

26:15.661 --> 26:18.098
before we told the jury
you guys were best friends.

26:18.141 --> 26:19.882
I should've told you.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.884
I was ashamed.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.625
Disgusted in myself.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.279
And I didn't want,
I didn't want Trish's son

26:25.322 --> 26:27.890
to find out after he'd already
lost his father.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.413
Did Sergeant Wells find out?

26:29.457 --> 26:31.328
Is that why you guys
were fighting?No.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.417
He didn't know
about me and Trish.

26:33.461 --> 26:35.855
We were fighting
about Nathan doing another tour,

26:35.898 --> 26:38.509
like I told you.Are you sure that's it?

26:38.553 --> 26:40.120
'Cause I can't defend you

26:40.163 --> 26:42.035
if you don't tell me everything.

26:42.078 --> 26:44.559
You don't have to defend me.[scoffs]

26:44.603 --> 26:46.343
I just want this to end.

26:46.387 --> 26:48.041
Well, the trial's almost over,

26:48.084 --> 26:49.390
and we have to get it right.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.435
We're talking
about the rest of your life.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.524
Trish has been through
too much pain.

26:53.568 --> 26:55.701
I'm not dragging her
through more.

26:55.744 --> 26:57.964
What do you mean?I'm done.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.705
That's it.

26:59.748 --> 27:01.358
I'm pleading guilty.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.578
You need to sit down and we
need to talk this through.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.014
Take me back
to the base.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.929
BULL:
Sergeant!

27:17.070 --> 27:18.549
Danny.You don't have to say it.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.203
Chunk's kid totally
smoked me on that affair.

27:20.247 --> 27:22.336
And she's barely off
her college newspaper.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.860
Well, that is not
what I was gonna say.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.775
But... yeah,

27:26.819 --> 27:28.995
I did not anticipate
the affair, either.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.953
So that is on me,
but now...

27:30.997 --> 27:33.216
Sergeant Bly...

27:33.260 --> 27:34.696
wants to plead guilty.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.132
I say let him.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.525
If he killed his friend
to keep banging his wife,

27:37.568 --> 27:38.657
he should go to jail.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.223
If Bly killed Wells

27:40.267 --> 27:41.877
so he could be with Trish,
why confess to the murder?

27:41.921 --> 27:43.270
Why not have a better plan?

27:43.313 --> 27:45.446
Well, murderers aren't
always that smart.

27:45.489 --> 27:46.795
Or logical.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.144
Well, that's true.

27:48.188 --> 27:49.580
I don't understand
Bly's sudden desire

27:49.624 --> 27:50.886
to plead guilty.

27:50.930 --> 27:53.062
I mean, he says
he doesn't want to put Trish

27:53.106 --> 27:54.760
through any more pain.

27:54.803 --> 27:57.588
The cat's already out
of the bag about the affair.

27:57.632 --> 27:58.938
What more pain
is there?

27:58.981 --> 28:00.417
Maybe he's hiding
something else.

28:00.461 --> 28:01.941
I want to know
what Bly and Wells were really

28:01.984 --> 28:03.725
fighting about in the driveway.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.727
Maybe one of the neighbors
overheard them?

28:05.771 --> 28:07.555
I'll check it out.

28:07.598 --> 28:09.470
Thank you.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.430
Kind of late
to be caffeinating.

28:13.474 --> 28:15.694
Well, I was just doing
a little research.

28:15.737 --> 28:16.912
Trying to figure out a way

28:16.956 --> 28:18.044
to stop that auction
I told you about.

28:18.087 --> 28:20.611
Oh, yeah. For the handsome

28:20.655 --> 28:21.743
French art dealer who

28:21.787 --> 28:22.918
saves the world's

28:22.962 --> 28:24.441
cultural heritage
in his free time.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.095
What?Just saying.

28:26.139 --> 28:27.749
I get it. Henri's a little...

28:27.793 --> 28:29.838
ooh-la-la.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.885
Yeah. I may have a little crush.

28:32.928 --> 28:33.973
You should ask him out.

28:34.016 --> 28:35.278
I don't know.

28:35.322 --> 28:36.932
Look, his gallery's
my happy place.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.629
It's where I go
to escape sometimes.

28:38.673 --> 28:40.283
If I ask him out...

28:40.327 --> 28:42.633
it doesn't work out,
then I can't go back there.

28:42.677 --> 28:44.331
Or maybe it does work out

28:44.374 --> 28:46.289
and you can go to his gallery
all the time.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.291
Or it doesn't work out and you
find a new gallery.

28:48.335 --> 28:49.945
I mean, this is New York City,
after all.

28:49.989 --> 28:51.773
[laughs]
Right now I just want

28:51.817 --> 28:53.949
another shot
at that smug auctioneer.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.082
I can't let that guy win.

28:57.692 --> 28:58.693
Good morning.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.129
Welcome back.

29:00.173 --> 29:02.262
You pass the bar since
the last time we spoke?

29:03.219 --> 29:05.308
I'd like to show you something.

29:05.352 --> 29:07.267
A notice
from the Cultural Ministry

29:07.310 --> 29:09.704
of the Ivory Coast showing
that the Guro tribal mask

29:09.748 --> 29:11.837
is in fact a stolen artifact.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.969
That's not proof of provenance.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.971
I told you,
until I get

29:16.015 --> 29:17.843
the provenance, I'm not removing

29:17.886 --> 29:19.235
the piece from auction.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.716
MARISSA: Oh, sorry,
I wasn't being clear.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.283
This notice isn't for you.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.285
I'm sending it
to all of the buyers

29:25.328 --> 29:27.809
registered to attend
today's auction.

29:27.853 --> 29:28.897
Good luck with that.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.594
My client list is confidential.

29:30.638 --> 29:32.205
She has the list.Yeah.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.249
I bet.

29:33.293 --> 29:34.816
Right next
to your fake law degree.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.818
It's true, I'm not a lawyer.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.385
But I am very resourceful.

29:38.428 --> 29:40.169
Yeah.
[exhales]

29:40.213 --> 29:42.302
Stolen antiquities
make buyers nervous.

29:43.259 --> 29:46.523
Fewer buyers means
lower bids on...

29:46.567 --> 29:47.786
everything.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.092
It's your choice,
Mr. Ratliff.

29:50.136 --> 29:52.529
You can remove the mask
from the auction,

29:52.573 --> 29:54.923
or I can hit send.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.406
Wait.

30:01.451 --> 30:02.670
[knocking]

30:02.713 --> 30:04.367
Morning.You got something?

30:04.411 --> 30:07.066
I'm not sure. I couldn't
find any neighbors

30:07.109 --> 30:08.894
who saw the fight, but
there's a guy who lives

30:08.937 --> 30:09.982
across the street
that let me go through

30:10.025 --> 30:11.157
his security camera footage.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.072
Did it get the fight?Yeah.

30:13.115 --> 30:15.770
But there was no audio,
so not very helpful, but...

30:15.814 --> 30:17.250
there was
something else.

30:17.293 --> 30:19.861
Two weeks before Wells died,
the camera caught this.

30:20.688 --> 30:23.560
That's Bly, pulling Wells
out of his garage.

30:25.606 --> 30:27.521
He's giving him CPR.Yep.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.218
Why would you try
and save your friend's life,

30:29.262 --> 30:30.916
only to kill him
two weeks later?

30:31.742 --> 30:34.180
Get me the M.E.'s report
on Wells.

30:40.751 --> 30:42.231
[knocks]

30:42.275 --> 30:43.885
Hey, Vic.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.669
Jason.

30:45.713 --> 30:47.715
I was gonna call, but...

30:47.758 --> 30:49.630
I thought maybe
you wouldn't answer it.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.501
I need your help.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.112
Nothing's changed,
I can't testify.

30:53.155 --> 30:55.114
I don't want you to.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.291
Bly lied.

30:59.466 --> 31:00.815
And we both missed it.

31:01.685 --> 31:03.252
What are you talking about?

31:03.296 --> 31:04.819
You said
the Army stigmatizes soldiers

31:04.863 --> 31:07.343
who seek treatment for PTSD?

31:08.823 --> 31:10.346
Not officially, but yes.

31:10.390 --> 31:12.566
I suspect there are a lot
of soldiers who don't report

31:12.609 --> 31:15.569
their PTSD even
if they have symptoms.

31:15.612 --> 31:18.006
More than I'd like
to think about. [sighs]

31:19.399 --> 31:21.444
Where are you going with this?

31:21.488 --> 31:24.273
I took another look
at Wells' M.E. report.

31:24.317 --> 31:26.841
His organs--
heart, liver,

31:26.885 --> 31:29.452
lung-- they were all cherry red.

31:29.496 --> 31:32.107
Which is consistent with
exposure to high levels

31:32.151 --> 31:34.544
of carbon monoxide. Say,
if you wanted to kill yourself

31:34.588 --> 31:36.155
in your garage
with car exhaust.

31:36.198 --> 31:38.374
Wells didn't die
from carbon monoxide poisoning.

31:38.418 --> 31:39.985
No, he did not.

31:40.028 --> 31:42.161
But he also didn't have any
defensive wounds on his body.

31:42.204 --> 31:44.337
Now how would
Sergeant Bly

31:44.380 --> 31:47.122
have been able to take a gun
away from a trained soldier

31:47.166 --> 31:49.908
without leaving any marks?

31:52.388 --> 31:54.477
What do you need my help with?

31:54.521 --> 31:56.262
We need to get Bly
to tell us the truth

31:56.305 --> 31:58.481
about what really happened
that night.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.539
I'm here.

32:12.582 --> 32:14.541
Not that I had a choice.

32:14.584 --> 32:15.759
What's this about?

32:15.803 --> 32:17.979
Well, I wanted to...

32:18.023 --> 32:19.981
talk to you about this
guilty plea you want

32:20.025 --> 32:21.852
to file-- I've got
some problems with it.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.463
Yeah, like what?

32:23.506 --> 32:25.552
I don't believe
you're guilty, for one.

32:25.595 --> 32:27.119
I don't care.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.424
If you won't do it,

32:28.468 --> 32:30.426
I'll get another lawyer...Sergeant?

32:30.470 --> 32:32.559
What do you hear?

32:32.602 --> 32:34.561
Listen.

32:34.604 --> 32:36.737
[birds chirping]

32:36.780 --> 32:38.217
What is that, birds?

32:38.260 --> 32:40.436
Squirrels? Do you hear any cars?

32:40.480 --> 32:41.481
I sure don't.

32:41.524 --> 32:43.048
BULL: No, I don't
hear any cars

32:43.091 --> 32:46.225
because there are
no cars anywhere near here.

32:47.226 --> 32:49.010
So how do you get

32:49.054 --> 32:51.186
triggered by a backfiring car?

32:51.230 --> 32:53.362
[scoffs]
Doesn't matter.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.364
It matters if there
was no car backfiring.

32:55.408 --> 32:58.193
It matters if Wells had
no defensive wounds.

32:58.237 --> 32:59.978
Your story's starting
to fall apart, Sergeant.

33:00.021 --> 33:02.284
Yeah, I know what happened!

33:04.417 --> 33:06.985
Wells also had
PTSD, didn't he?

33:08.290 --> 33:10.379
He was suffering badly
and you knew it?

33:10.423 --> 33:12.251
That's why he tried
to kill himself

33:12.294 --> 33:14.557
in the garage
that night.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.733
And we know

33:16.777 --> 33:18.431
that you saved him.

33:24.654 --> 33:26.917
Carter.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.965
You did everything
you could for Wells.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.576
You could not have
done anything more.

33:34.621 --> 33:36.623
But you can help
your brothers and sisters.

33:36.666 --> 33:39.147
The ones who are suffering
just like Wells did

33:39.191 --> 33:41.106
and are afraid to say anything.

33:43.934 --> 33:46.198
The truth is a powerful thing,
Sergeant.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.331
Tell the truth about Wells.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.813
Talk about
what happens

33:52.856 --> 33:55.294
if you don't get treatment.

33:56.860 --> 33:59.124
I didn't help Nathan.

34:00.647 --> 34:02.823
I couldn't.

34:03.911 --> 34:05.782
He was struggling...

34:05.826 --> 34:07.828
so much.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.832
Just listen to
what I'm saying.I won't do it.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.355
I'll walk you in myself.

34:13.399 --> 34:15.662
No!Nathan, you need help.

34:15.705 --> 34:17.577
What I need is to get the hell
out of here and redeploy.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.666
Why do you want to go back?It's easier over there.

34:19.709 --> 34:21.668
It feels, uh...

34:21.711 --> 34:23.322
normal.Another tour's

34:23.365 --> 34:24.975
only gonna make
things worse.

34:25.019 --> 34:26.847
Things can't get any worse!

34:27.630 --> 34:29.110
I got to tell Trish.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.112
No.About you needing help,
about the garage.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.896
Don't, man.She needs to know.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.420
She deserves to know.

34:34.463 --> 34:36.552
Come on.

34:36.596 --> 34:38.119
Come on, I can't have

34:38.163 --> 34:40.121
my wife knowing about this.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.644
Thinking I'm weak.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.472
Thinking I'm...

34:43.516 --> 34:45.518
I'm some problem.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.958
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

34:54.048 --> 34:56.268
[exclaims]

34:57.356 --> 34:58.922
Hey, uh...

34:58.966 --> 35:00.576
Let's just hang.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.926
Yeah?

35:03.710 --> 35:05.146
Let's just hang.

35:06.974 --> 35:09.498
All right.All right.

35:12.371 --> 35:14.808
Want to go to the truck
and grab some more beers?

35:15.722 --> 35:17.985
Yeah, sure.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.774
[gunshot][gasps]

35:24.818 --> 35:26.907
Nathan!

35:28.735 --> 35:31.346
Nathan was a hero.

35:32.565 --> 35:34.132
I didn't want his suicide

35:34.175 --> 35:36.134
to take away from that.

35:38.048 --> 35:40.616
To tarnish his memory for Trish.

35:40.660 --> 35:43.445
For his son.[crying]

35:44.272 --> 35:46.709
So you confessed to a murder

35:46.753 --> 35:48.537
that didn't occur?

35:49.538 --> 35:52.193
Nathan was my best friend
and I betrayed him.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.543
[sniffles]
He didn't know.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.067
But I knew.

35:57.111 --> 35:58.852
And my life...

35:58.895 --> 36:00.593
[chuckles softly]

36:00.636 --> 36:03.117
I don't have much
to be proud of.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.989
Nothing to look forward to.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.296
Especially now
that Nathan's not here

36:08.340 --> 36:10.690
anymore.[crying]

36:10.733 --> 36:13.214
This was just, um...

36:13.258 --> 36:14.433
[sniffling]

36:14.476 --> 36:16.913
I was just trying
to make things right.

36:19.786 --> 36:22.092
[sniffles]

36:22.919 --> 36:25.095
No further questions,
Your Honor.

36:25.966 --> 36:27.707
Has the jury reached a verdict?

36:27.750 --> 36:29.491
JUROR: We have,
Your Honor.

36:29.535 --> 36:32.102
In The State of New York
v. Sergeant Carter Bly,

36:32.146 --> 36:34.844
we the jury find
the defendant...

36:35.628 --> 36:36.846
...not guilty.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.587
[exhales]NAUMANN: My thanks

36:38.631 --> 36:40.110
to the jury for their service.

36:40.154 --> 36:42.287
This court is adjourned.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.811
[indistinct chatter]

36:44.854 --> 36:46.552
Thank you.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.510
It's my pleasure.

36:52.471 --> 36:54.255
Excuse me.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.952
Congratulations,
Sergeant.

36:55.996 --> 36:58.172
And you, too, Jason.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.088
Well, you guys didn't make it
easy, but we got there.

37:01.131 --> 37:03.090
Why did you not
tell me?

37:03.133 --> 37:05.832
I should have known.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.181
I didn't know how to.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.357
No, don't-don't say that.

37:09.401 --> 37:11.620
How did I not know

37:11.664 --> 37:14.188
he was so broken?

37:15.320 --> 37:17.800
[crying]:
How did I not...?

37:17.844 --> 37:20.150
[sobbing]

37:29.856 --> 37:31.640
Anna, hold up, hey.

37:31.684 --> 37:33.686
Oh, am I allowed to speak now?

37:33.729 --> 37:35.296
Has the gag
order lifted?

37:35.340 --> 37:37.516
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
put you on the witness list.

37:37.559 --> 37:38.995
That was petty.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.649
Yeah. It was.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.129
I was annoyed.

37:42.172 --> 37:43.609
You showed up your old man.

37:43.652 --> 37:46.002
And, yeah, maybe you were right,
maybe I wasn't ready

37:46.046 --> 37:48.353
to see you do your thing.

37:50.006 --> 37:52.139
Clearly I was wrong,
and that's on me.

37:52.182 --> 37:53.183
So...

37:53.227 --> 37:55.185
can I make it up to you?

37:55.229 --> 37:57.275
Can I buy you something to eat?

37:58.319 --> 38:00.321
I get to choose the restaurant?

38:00.365 --> 38:01.670
Of course.

38:01.714 --> 38:03.324
Okay.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.934
So...

38:04.978 --> 38:07.415
have you given any thought
to maybe covering sports?

38:07.459 --> 38:10.244
'Cause I don't want to do this
kind of thing any time soon.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.333
[laughs]
I hate sports.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.553
But you feel free to cover
all the boring cases.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.772
That way I won't feel
tempted to write about them.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.383
[laughs]

38:18.426 --> 38:20.036
We both know
that's not gonna happen.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.343
[laughs][elevator bell dings]

38:22.387 --> 38:23.736
Come on.

38:23.779 --> 38:24.998
[knocking]

38:25.041 --> 38:28.175
Hey... you have a visitor.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.177
HENRI:
I hope I'm not disturbing you.No... [stammers]

38:30.220 --> 38:32.048
Of course not. Come in.

38:32.092 --> 38:34.964
Well, um...
it was nice to meet you.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.966
And you.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.408
Uh, to what do I owe
the pleasure?Um...

38:43.451 --> 38:45.148
I-I brought you something

38:45.192 --> 38:46.976
as a thank-you.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.239
Oh.The provenance documents
finally arrived.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.154
And the mask is on its way back
to the Ivory Coast.

38:51.198 --> 38:54.070
That is wonderful news.

38:57.247 --> 38:58.684
Oh.

38:58.727 --> 39:00.990
It's beautiful.

39:01.034 --> 39:04.080
I don't recognize it
from your gallery.

39:04.124 --> 39:05.691
No, no, no,
it's not from my gallery.

39:05.734 --> 39:08.346
It's, um, this is, uh, from me.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.478
You paint?

39:11.479 --> 39:13.525
I had no idea.We mustn't reveal

39:13.568 --> 39:14.961
all our secrets at once.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.881
Henri?Hmm?

39:21.924 --> 39:24.579
Would you like to go
to dinner with me sometime?

39:25.406 --> 39:26.712
To share more secrets?

39:26.755 --> 39:29.802
I might need
a bit of wine before that.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.418
[clears throat]

39:37.462 --> 39:39.202
TAGGART:
Word came down today.

39:39.246 --> 39:42.641
Bly's getting an Other
Than Honorable discharge.

39:42.684 --> 39:44.425
For lying.

39:44.469 --> 39:45.992
That sounds a bit harsh.

39:46.035 --> 39:47.820
I understand why
it seems that way.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.518
And I understand
why they did it.

39:50.562 --> 39:52.607
Really?

39:52.651 --> 39:54.870
There's a code.

39:54.914 --> 39:57.046
You follow it or leave.
That's the deal.

39:57.090 --> 39:58.874
[sighs]

39:58.918 --> 40:01.399
You know, Vic,
sometimes I think you give a...

40:01.442 --> 40:04.140
little bit too much
to this thing.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.579
I get that.

40:07.622 --> 40:09.624
But sometimes the people
inside this thing

40:09.668 --> 40:11.931
think the people outside
don't give enough.

40:11.974 --> 40:14.020
Ah, point taken.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.153
Two worlds.[bugle playing]

40:17.197 --> 40:19.242
Two worlds.
