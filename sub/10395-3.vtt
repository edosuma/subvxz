00:09.710 --> 00:17.710
I'm told you're a man
who can help me.

00:18.252 --> 00:23.723
Some time in mid 19th century
1850s my great, great

00:23.724 --> 00:31.724
grandfather immigrated
to south America.

00:37.838 --> 00:38.838
Utopian dreams.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.007
My aunt used to tell stories he

00:41.008 --> 00:44.311
was into arms smuggling
or who knows, you know?

00:44.312 --> 00:52.312
No idea.

01:02.963 --> 01:10.963
â™ª

01:56.884 --> 01:59.051
For most people Paraguay is

01:59.052 --> 02:03.723
an empty space on the
lap of Latin America.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.559
A country of only six million

02:06.560 --> 02:09.829
where a vast percentage of the

02:09.830 --> 02:17.830
land is steaming hot
jungle or a huge desert.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.942
Only a few large cities offer a

02:22.943 --> 02:30.943
respite from the
impressive heat.

02:39.593 --> 02:46.266
A thousand miles up river
from the Atlantic ocean sits

02:46.267 --> 02:49.269
Paraguay's remote capitol city

02:49.270 --> 02:52.138
known largely for being a post

02:52.139 --> 02:55.542
war refuge for freeing Nazis and

02:55.543 --> 02:57.477
extremely unpleasant dictators.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.945
This place of all places in the

02:58.946 --> 03:01.614
world is where my great, great,

03:01.615 --> 03:03.783
great grandfather disappeared

03:03.784 --> 03:11.784
without explanation
sometime in 1850s.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.795
I'm told your a man
that can help me.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.297
How do you do?

03:17.298 --> 03:19.399
May I call you Tony.

03:19.400 --> 03:19.800
Please.

03:19.801 --> 03:21.568
You're here for the first time.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.336
First time in Paraguay, yes.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.406
Lido bar has always been like
the central switchboard.

03:26.407 --> 03:34.407
A gathering place.

03:35.182 --> 03:38.251
Ladies in orange tanks serve

03:38.252 --> 03:43.323
working class food to people
of every walk of life.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.925
This place is very unique.

03:45.926 --> 03:52.999
I've been here for
more than 50 years.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.169
Let's get something to eat.

03:57.170 --> 04:02.008
It's beef, onion, and hard
cooked egg deep fried to

04:02.009 --> 04:02.310
perfection.

04:02.311 --> 04:03.543
Cattle is the big
business of this country.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.946
It used to be cattle
and smuggling.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.848
These days it's still cattle.

04:08.849 --> 04:16.849
You see a lot of beef
is what I'm saying.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.060
This is a mystery
to most people.

04:22.062 --> 04:28.335
What we know comes Nazi's
and Germans and crimes.

04:28.336 --> 04:32.805
Do you think that's an
undeserved reputation?

04:32.806 --> 04:33.873
It's a nice country.

04:33.874 --> 04:34.742
A beautiful country.

04:34.743 --> 04:37.544
He was one of a team of
people I sent out looking for

04:37.545 --> 04:40.212
the mysterious lost Bourdain.

04:40.213 --> 04:46.719
What are you called upon to do?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.555
Normally counterfeiting.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.723
In the old days it's said much

04:50.724 --> 04:54.093
of this counterfeiting had
partners in the government.

04:54.094 --> 05:02.094
Not so much anymore.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.906
He was the last of his
kind in Paraguay.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.509
Of German heritage he ruled the

05:09.510 --> 05:12.612
country until 1989 with a quite

05:12.613 --> 05:17.684
charm but behind the scenes was

05:17.685 --> 05:19.686
another thing utilizing an

05:19.687 --> 05:26.726
outfit of trained secret
police he to toured and tossed

05:26.727 --> 05:29.028
of helicopters over the jungle.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.129
The list goes on.

05:30.130 --> 05:33.099
One in four was said to have

05:33.100 --> 05:34.133
cooperated willingly or not as

05:34.134 --> 05:36.769
paid informers on their
fellow citizens.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.238
It's quite a history
in this country.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.040
Crazy, tragic, violent.

05:41.041 --> 05:45.778
Things are changing, a lot.

05:45.779 --> 05:51.818
And now.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.953
Sometime in the mid 19th

05:53.954 --> 05:59.626
centuries or 1850s he immigrated

05:59.627 --> 06:02.762
to south America, first
Argentina but apparently came

06:02.763 --> 06:02.963
here.

06:02.964 --> 06:10.964
That's really almost
all I know for sure.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.408
Did he die of old age?

06:15.409 --> 06:17.109
Did he die of syphilis?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.310
I have no idea.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.246
I'd like to know.

06:19.247 --> 06:21.080
I'd like to find a grave site.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.314
That would be great.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.484
My father died at 57.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.085
His father in his 20s I believe.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.687
I'll be 58 in June.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.490
I think I am the longest living

06:30.491 --> 06:37.630
male Bourdain possibly ever.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.599
You're lonely in the world?

06:38.600 --> 06:41.701
I'm lonely in the world, yes.

06:41.702 --> 06:45.472
If I could solve the mystery of

06:45.473 --> 06:47.373
John Bourdain I would be happy.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.541
It would be great if you found

06:48.542 --> 06:51.010
out he owned a huge ranch and

06:51.011 --> 06:52.545
they have been waiting for his

06:52.546 --> 06:54.380
relatives to claim his property.

06:54.381 --> 07:02.381
Maybe not.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.161
I am trying to make some
sense of this country.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.897
You lived here how long?

07:10.898 --> 07:13.199
22 years.

07:13.200 --> 07:19.539
What a strange and nice country.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.875
Go to Paraguay and find a
German to show you around.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.712
Not so crazy or
unrepresentative.

07:25.713 --> 07:30.550
People came to this country from

07:30.551 --> 07:32.985
everywhere to as Emmerson called

07:32.986 --> 07:34.220
it make their own world.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.155
What's good to eat here?

07:36.156 --> 07:40.660
I suppose you want
something Paraguay.

07:40.661 --> 07:41.495
Yes.

07:41.496 --> 07:47.900
It's rice with fried
beef with egg on top.

07:47.901 --> 07:48.836
I'm there.

07:48.837 --> 07:50.369
Good.

07:50.370 --> 07:58.370
And there's a soup that is

07:58.846 --> 08:00.179
very very old Paraguay stuff.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.914
That looks good.

08:01.915 --> 08:02.449
That looks very good.

08:02.449 --> 08:02.750
Yeah.

08:02.751 --> 08:10.751
That's good, man.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.894
I'm trying to make some
sense of this country.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.195
You lived here how long?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.263
22 years.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.098
Why did you come here
in the first place?

08:19.099 --> 08:26.405
I was born in east Germany

08:26.406 --> 08:28.741
and then in '89 the wall break

08:28.742 --> 08:30.643
down and you say
wow, you will go.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.711
I haven't seen anything of

08:31.712 --> 08:33.312
this country yet but what I read

08:33.313 --> 08:36.716
was the world's back water

08:36.717 --> 08:37.784
filled with banked that had been

08:37.784 --> 08:40.419
looted, institutions
that didn't work.

08:40.419 --> 08:41.654
Every carried a gun.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.722
It was like the
wild west but poor.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.457
It's not that anymore.

08:44.458 --> 08:50.462
A bit of this is true.

08:50.463 --> 08:55.234
I by myself got a .45
on my head last week.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.337
That's common for me.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.438
Seldom have I seen a country

08:59.439 --> 09:01.240
where one after the other you've

09:01.241 --> 09:04.577
had the most insane suicidal

09:04.578 --> 09:08.915
group of dictators
century after century.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.984
You are right.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.486
Even in times the better part of

09:14.487 --> 09:18.457
Paraguay was behind him.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.292
They're very very easy to

09:20.293 --> 09:21.961
influence and business I believe

09:21.962 --> 09:28.334
unchanged until a short time ago

09:28.335 --> 09:31.370
now there is a growing
middle class.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.939
Better education than before and

09:32.940 --> 09:40.940
that makes the people say no.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.852
How was the soup?

09:45.853 --> 09:47.053
I liked it.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.188
The way my wife cooks it.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.823
I like it better with chicken.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.293
But chicken is
more for Saturday.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.484
Paraguay was a very poor

10:18.485 --> 10:20.019
country. Spaniards came because

10:20.020 --> 10:22.588
there was a lot of silver in the area.
They found none,

10:22.589 --> 10:30.589
so they lost interest
in Paraguay.

10:34.234 --> 10:41.373
This is the only country
in Latin America where the

10:41.374 --> 10:44.010
indigenous language is
the official language.

10:44.011 --> 10:49.015
I am married to a Paraguay

10:49.016 --> 10:51.383
woman and when her fathers come

10:51.384 --> 10:55.888
in they automatically talk that

10:55.889 --> 11:03.889
and I'm more or less out.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.570
El supremo.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.105
Got to love it.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.275
A nearly 200 year succession of

11:16.276 --> 11:18.978
dictators began in 1811 when he

11:18.979 --> 11:22.381
declared himself El
supremo for life.

11:22.382 --> 11:27.754
He insisted Paraguay become
a mixed race society.

11:27.755 --> 11:34.460
They're neither
Spanish nor Indians.

11:34.461 --> 11:40.967
El supremos prevented marriage
between white and white.

11:40.968 --> 11:45.772
Today 95% are of mixed blood.

11:45.773 --> 11:49.275
And we usually speak
two languages.

11:49.276 --> 11:55.081
Right.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.783
This is the central market?

11:56.784 --> 12:04.784
This is the biggest one
and the most popular one.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.337
I'm hungry.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.272
What's good here?

12:19.273 --> 12:25.778
We opted for a little catfish.

12:25.779 --> 12:33.779
And okay the saying is that
it makes man very powerful.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.224
What's he got?

12:38.225 --> 12:39.625
That looks good.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.494
There was a good Italian
influence in Paraguay.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.797
So maybe this stew
comes from this.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.198
It's from all over the world.

12:46.199 --> 12:54.199
So you invite them and
get the catfish stew?

13:04.417 --> 13:06.518
Could you pass me the soup.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.754
The soup is very unique.

13:08.755 --> 13:11.824
Our dictator Lopez's favorite

13:11.825 --> 13:14.827
soup was corn soup and one day

13:14.828 --> 13:16.395
he ordered his favorite soup and

13:16.396 --> 13:18.998
the cook when he opened
the pot it was a cake.

13:18.999 --> 13:24.403
Paraguay has not been noted
for its history of kinder,

13:24.404 --> 13:25.771
gentler leaders.

13:25.772 --> 13:28.240
In the 1800 two generations of

13:28.241 --> 13:31.677
Lopez, father and son, one
dictator after the other

13:31.678 --> 13:33.345
certainly left their
marks on this country.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.780
Lopez was pretty much known

13:34.781 --> 13:38.117
for putting a wrong
stamp on a letter.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.185
You get shot.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.420
So the cook didn't
want to get shot.

13:41.421 --> 13:46.425
He showed up in front of Lopez

13:46.426 --> 13:50.696
and says this is soup and the

13:50.697 --> 13:52.298
dictator ate it and he liked it

13:52.299 --> 13:56.735
and later the entire
country eat it.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.604
So it's cheesey cornbread?

13:58.605 --> 13:58.872
Yeah.

13:58.872 --> 13:59.206
Awesome.

13:59.207 --> 14:07.207
Good meal.

14:12.619 --> 14:15.955
So this was the house or one

14:15.956 --> 14:18.290
of the houses of madam lynch.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.226
Exactly.

14:19.227 --> 14:22.995
The journalist, poet, and
author has written books on

14:22.996 --> 14:23.897
Paraguay's history.

14:23.898 --> 14:26.165
Now who was madam lynch.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.301
A murky background
would you say?

14:29.302 --> 14:33.105
There's talk about that.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.406
Somebody say she was a great

14:34.407 --> 14:36.442
woman or she was
a very evil one.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.778
She came over on the
famous trip from France.

14:39.779 --> 14:40.247
Right.

14:40.248 --> 14:44.483
In 1840s Lopez senior
reversed many of Paraguay's

14:44.484 --> 14:46.585
isolationist policies.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.955
He invited foreigners to settle

14:48.956 --> 14:52.524
here and built one of south
America's first rail ways.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.526
It's steam engines taken out of

14:54.527 --> 14:58.630
service only a few years ago and

14:58.631 --> 15:00.933
he sent his son to Europe.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.970
His mission his father sent
him out to get what arms?

15:03.971 --> 15:11.377
Arms and technicians,
engineers and machinery.

15:11.378 --> 15:15.281
Junior by most contemporary
accounts was an idiot.

15:15.282 --> 15:19.018
So he came back with a
mistress, madam lynch.

15:19.019 --> 15:19.786
Yes.

15:19.786 --> 15:20.620
Which dad wasn't
too happy about.

15:20.621 --> 15:28.621
Right.

15:37.370 --> 15:45.370
He was very traditional and
wanted his son to marry a

15:49.482 --> 15:50.983
Paraguayan woman and do
everything by the book.

15:50.984 --> 15:55.154
She was the daughter
of an Irish doctor.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.556
Ambitious, social climbing,
fond of nice things.

15:57.557 --> 16:05.331
Clothes imported from France.

16:05.332 --> 16:13.332
And there were parties here.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.277
He showed madam lynch to his

16:18.278 --> 16:21.913
father and his father was
upset so she was put aside.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.349
Kept as a mistress.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.952
And that was the way society
tried to treat her and she

16:26.953 --> 16:29.621
wanted to be treated
as the... Princess?

16:29.622 --> 16:37.622
Yes.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.433
Tell me about her
famous boat trip.

16:41.434 --> 16:48.907
On one of her more notorious
adventures as hostess she

16:48.908 --> 16:49.776
organized an outing.

16:49.777 --> 16:52.144
She invited all of
society to join her.

16:52.145 --> 16:52.745
Right.

16:52.746 --> 16:55.314
The river steamer was
engaged for the party.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.483
Well, there were some issues

16:57.484 --> 17:05.483
between the ladies
and madam lynch.

17:08.261 --> 17:13.232
Once on board they treated
their hostess like trash.

17:13.233 --> 17:18.270
So she got upset and threw
over board all the food they

17:18.271 --> 17:19.471
were supposed to eat.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.406
She had it all
thrown in the river?

17:20.407 --> 17:23.108
Yes.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.576
Then she ordered the captain

17:24.577 --> 17:26.944
to stop the boat and let her

17:26.945 --> 17:29.748
guests just sit there in
that jungle heat for hours.

17:29.749 --> 17:35.321
Throwing tubs of caviar and
whole roasted pigs into the

17:35.322 --> 17:37.789
river in front of the
starving aristocrats?

17:37.790 --> 17:39.759
Somehow that pleases me.

17:54.807 --> 17:58.444
Going back to the very
beginnings, various groups with

17:58.445 --> 18:00.279
stars in their eyes came here

18:00.280 --> 18:08.280
seeking to create a utopia
along the lines, a paradise.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.793
Repopulate Latin
America with Germans.

18:14.794 --> 18:19.365
British, Italians,
you had everybody.

18:19.366 --> 18:19.632
Yeah.

18:19.633 --> 18:23.869
I had a great, great, great
grandfather come over to

18:23.870 --> 18:25.971
Paraguay around the 1850s.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.473
Right.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.709
Might have been, myself, a

18:30.710 --> 18:37.816
seeker of some kind
of utopian dreams.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.551
Originally from France?

18:39.552 --> 18:40.752
From France, yes.

18:40.753 --> 18:41.388
What city?

18:41.388 --> 18:41.921
Do you know?

18:41.922 --> 18:48.059
My great, great, grandfather
was from near Bourdeax.

18:48.060 --> 18:56.060
So I'm curious about
this settlement.

19:21.261 --> 19:25.364
The Paraguay river still as
it was 150 years ago the

19:25.365 --> 19:29.535
country's main artery.

19:29.536 --> 19:37.536
A thoroughfare for
transporting people and goods.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.714
Who lives out there?

19:42.715 --> 19:45.884
Of all the people we see
fishing on the river banks.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.386
Are they fishing for dinner?

19:47.387 --> 19:51.723
Most of them are
fishing for dinner.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.893
They decide by
themselves to live here.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.562
They could go and start working
on a construction place

19:56.563 --> 20:02.568
tomorrow.

20:02.569 --> 20:10.569
Peter organized a trip up
river to see new Bourdeaux.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.748
What was hoped would
be a new France.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.917
The fish today 14 kilo that's

20:18.918 --> 20:20.686
half a month's salary and you

20:20.687 --> 20:21.987
get with a bit of good
luck in one night.

20:21.988 --> 20:29.988
Right.

20:51.618 --> 20:57.956
Outside of the cities Paraguay
is sparsely populated.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.359
Indigenous groups, a few settled

21:00.360 --> 21:02.628
Europeans, Mennonites, Germans

21:02.629 --> 21:06.465
and a fishing lure and
shotgun salesman.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.634
What are the shotguns for?

21:08.635 --> 21:12.871
Bandits?

21:12.872 --> 21:13.139
Varmentes?

21:13.140 --> 21:15.474
To hunt deer and water pig.

21:15.475 --> 21:20.178
That's a peacemaker.

21:20.179 --> 21:23.148
Any rogue Nazis
we can shoot now?

21:23.149 --> 21:27.586
I am tempted by the offer of
a cheap shotgun for sale.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.722
Figures Peter would know this
guy but reason wins out.

21:30.723 --> 21:34.159
I don't think we're going
to buy a shotgun today.

21:34.160 --> 21:38.330
Me, fear, shotgun,
shot sunny day.

21:38.331 --> 21:46.331
That's not a good mix.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.518
Unlike madam lynch's guests

21:59.519 --> 22:01.853
I'm making sure I eat
on this boat trip.

22:01.854 --> 22:05.624
The most important
part of my meal.

22:05.625 --> 22:06.892
Cold, frosty beverages.

22:06.893 --> 22:07.460
I started early.

22:07.460 --> 22:07.960
Cheers.

22:07.961 --> 22:15.961
Cheers.

22:19.972 --> 22:23.208
Fish and a man goe salsa.

22:23.209 --> 22:26.645
You have the two most
appreciated fish here on the

22:26.646 --> 22:28.880
table of Paraguay.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.650
That's the catfish.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.885
And that's the... oh, of course.

22:33.886 --> 22:34.487
Yes.

22:34.488 --> 22:40.726
That's tasty.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.594
That's nice.

22:42.595 --> 22:50.595
I'm curious about this whole
episode of the settlement.

22:52.505 --> 22:57.743
They were supposed to be
most of them farmers.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.411
But just 86 were farmers.

22:59.412 --> 23:07.412
Who were the other people
they were Taylors and

23:08.254 --> 23:08.555
shoemakers.

23:08.556 --> 23:14.593
They were put in the jungle
and left by himself.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.994
Right.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.596
Why here of all the
people in the world.

23:17.597 --> 23:23.001
People talk about it as a hell.

23:23.002 --> 23:29.274
It's hot here... it's dry,
it's red, it's difficult.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.209
You have all the mosquitos.

23:31.210 --> 23:39.210
A flatland of cactus
and thorns and misery.

23:49.462 --> 23:53.298
There's a part where you enter
the country you are good

23:53.299 --> 23:53.500
food.

23:53.501 --> 23:56.367
Did they ever see
this as utopia?

23:56.368 --> 24:04.368
No, I'm sure not.

24:04.410 --> 24:05.077
That?

24:05.077 --> 24:05.545
This.

24:05.546 --> 24:13.546
Wow that's not how
I pictured it.

24:14.153 --> 24:22.153
Doesn't look like
Bordeaux to me.

24:24.497 --> 24:25.731
There's nothing much left.

24:25.732 --> 24:33.338
I'm told a small museum
of artifacts.

24:33.339 --> 24:37.843
The site where it once existed.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.011
It was money for each settler.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.713
Perhaps there was a
communication break down

24:41.714 --> 24:43.081
somewhere and he might have told

24:43.082 --> 24:45.684
them I'm bringing you the finest

24:45.685 --> 24:48.053
farmers France has to offer.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.788
Right and he might have told

24:49.789 --> 24:51.389
these Frenchmen they're going to

24:51.390 --> 24:52.691
give you free property.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.092
You don't have to do anything.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.927
You'll live like kings.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.697
Just reach up in the trees
and fruit and gold bars are

24:58.698 --> 25:06.698
dropping.

25:10.042 --> 25:13.278
In fact, they were thrown
out and say here you are.

25:13.279 --> 25:13.713
That's your land.

25:13.714 --> 25:21.714
Go ahead.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.493
These four French guys show up.

25:28.494 --> 25:28.961
Right.

25:28.962 --> 25:32.564
Lopez senior and the
government kept their side of

25:32.565 --> 25:33.232
the bargain.

25:33.233 --> 25:36.067
They provided them with
houses, equipment.

25:36.068 --> 25:41.773
Tours and animals
and everything.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.308
Needs to have one of these.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.343
Pressed sandwiches I think.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.913
And that's it.

25:47.914 --> 25:48.414
Dig, grow.

25:48.415 --> 25:51.449
The settlers quickly discovered
that farming is hard

25:51.450 --> 25:53.685
work and that the conditions in

25:53.686 --> 25:59.424
no way resembled the new
France of their dreams.

25:59.425 --> 26:02.127
That's a big snake.

26:02.128 --> 26:08.533
So they get broke and they
decide to leave the colony.

26:08.534 --> 26:09.801
How many French were left at

26:09.802 --> 26:13.939
the end of the new
Bordeaux experiment?

26:13.940 --> 26:14.273
Did any stay?

26:14.274 --> 26:22.274
Some of them but few.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.616
Any chance he ended his life

26:24.617 --> 26:26.718
here ending the unclaimed escape

26:26.719 --> 26:28.787
and what was prime cattle

26:28.788 --> 26:31.758
country turns quickly to dust.

27:09.662 --> 27:16.434
So, you have some
information perhaps of the

27:16.435 --> 27:22.073
elusive John Bourdain I hear?

27:22.074 --> 27:24.175
I don't know what he did here.

27:24.176 --> 27:28.179
Of course I'm hoping for
something extremely glamorous.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.349
A gun runner, drug smuggler.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.418
Maybe he died in the saddle.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.453
Maybe he died happy.

27:35.454 --> 27:36.888
Maybe he was living out in the

27:36.889 --> 27:41.226
bush surrounded by adoring
indigenous women.

27:41.227 --> 27:41.728
I don't know.

27:41.729 --> 27:48.566
You know if he was a masseur for

27:48.567 --> 27:52.203
madam lynch I guess I
would be let down.

27:52.204 --> 27:55.907
I had contact with another

27:55.908 --> 27:57.709
historian around the world and

27:57.710 --> 28:00.378
the history of your family
is very interesting.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.880
Oh, really?

28:01.881 --> 28:02.782
Okay.

28:02.782 --> 28:03.649
Interesting.

28:03.650 --> 28:11.650
Yeah, your family, your
grandfather John Bourdain came

28:12.892 --> 28:13.392
following the sun.

28:13.393 --> 28:17.128
Okay the facts as I know them
so far I think are this.

28:17.129 --> 28:22.768
My great, great, granddad, John,

28:22.769 --> 28:26.738
his son came to live
with his uncle.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.139
1850 John Bourdain moves.

28:28.140 --> 28:31.910
This is the document that we
have showing him arriving.

28:31.911 --> 28:32.644
There he is.

28:32.645 --> 28:40.418
In that time, he worked
with... with a hat maker.

28:40.419 --> 28:41.519
A hat maker?

28:41.520 --> 28:44.956
I'm pretty sure he said hat
maker which have to say

28:44.957 --> 28:49.594
disappoints me like a lot.

28:49.595 --> 28:51.696
The whole elusive wing of south

28:51.697 --> 28:53.664
American Bourdains were project

28:53.665 --> 28:55.633
runway contestants of their day?

28:55.634 --> 29:00.872
In 1855 Lopez's son arrives.

29:00.873 --> 29:03.308
With madam lynch.

29:03.309 --> 29:09.614
Madame lynch was fond of
things like French couture.

29:09.615 --> 29:12.017
Yes and that changed
the way of dress.

29:12.018 --> 29:14.185
She might have been
good for business.

29:14.186 --> 29:17.856
I'm trying to put this in a
light I can be enthusiastic

29:17.857 --> 29:18.290
about.

29:18.291 --> 29:21.726
Like how clearly forward
thinking they were.

29:21.727 --> 29:23.128
His customers were a hat maker.

29:23.129 --> 29:26.898
The people that treated her
with such utter contempt.

29:26.899 --> 29:30.235
Did they live in the
colonial homes?

29:30.236 --> 29:32.838
In that type of residence?

29:32.839 --> 29:33.305
Yes.

29:33.306 --> 29:36.741
Times were changing in south
America too in those days.

29:36.742 --> 29:40.078
Society ladies craved the
latest French fashion.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.379
There was money to be made.

29:41.380 --> 29:49.380
I'm bummed.

29:53.392 --> 30:01.392
He would have died in 1858.

30:02.501 --> 30:02.935
Or before.

30:02.936 --> 30:05.871
It was a good way to die

30:05.872 --> 30:07.338
because he wouldn't have
to join this horrible war.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.007
He missed the war?

30:09.008 --> 30:10.876
Yeah.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.443
The old Lopez died.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.712
The young Lopez got in power.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.347
Our man becomes president.

30:16.348 --> 30:19.250
Yes, Francisco Lopez.

30:19.251 --> 30:27.251
Absolutely the most
megomaniacal dictator.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.261
You're right.

30:29.262 --> 30:31.963
He was unkind to his siblings.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.264
His brothers were tortured

30:33.265 --> 30:35.533
and killed and the
sisters were jailed.

30:35.534 --> 30:36.068
Taken into tiger cages.

30:36.069 --> 30:39.237
Tiger cages.

30:39.238 --> 30:47.238
Tiger cages and the mother
was given some beating.

30:47.779 --> 30:51.082
The 60 something-year-old

30:51.083 --> 30:52.717
mother was flogged and
beaten in front of him.

30:52.718 --> 30:53.652
Not a nice man.

30:53.653 --> 30:55.153
He believed that he had a

30:55.154 --> 30:57.722
chance to get married with the

30:57.723 --> 31:00.125
daughter of the
emperor of Brazil.

31:00.126 --> 31:00.559
That's right.

31:00.560 --> 31:04.229
He was refused on very
unflattering terms.

31:04.230 --> 31:09.567
Thanks presumably to his
expansionist ambitions he

31:09.568 --> 31:11.769
dragged Paraguay into the
triple alliance war.

31:11.770 --> 31:14.572
He essentially challenged
all three neighbors.

31:14.573 --> 31:18.343
Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.

31:18.344 --> 31:19.078
To war.

31:19.079 --> 31:21.812
This doesn't seem
like a good idea.

31:21.813 --> 31:23.781
In what would become the

31:23.782 --> 31:25.483
bloodiest war in Latin America's

31:25.484 --> 31:28.586
history, hundreds
of thousands died.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.922
When Lopez ran out of adults he

31:30.923 --> 31:32.023
sent children into the field

31:32.024 --> 31:34.325
dressed only in rags, armed with

31:34.326 --> 31:37.328
sticks, painted to
look like guns.

31:37.329 --> 31:44.769
My great grandfather was a
10-year-old boy and he was

31:44.770 --> 31:47.038
dressed alike because otherwise

31:47.039 --> 31:55.039
he was going to be
enrolled into the army.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.517
Madam lynch survived.

31:59.518 --> 31:59.885
Yes.

31:59.886 --> 32:01.686
But with her money she was

32:01.687 --> 32:02.654
allowed to keep her possessions?

32:02.655 --> 32:05.523
Yes.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.392
In history it's hard to find

32:07.393 --> 32:11.296
a more disastrous or more cruel

32:11.297 --> 32:15.300
or pointless campaign
it would seem.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.002
When all was said and done as

32:17.003 --> 32:19.237
much as 60% of the population

32:19.238 --> 32:27.238
and 90% of the men of
this country were dead.

32:35.521 --> 32:43.521
The survivors were just
like 50 or 40,000 people.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.215
There was nothing here
for like 100 years.

33:10.222 --> 33:13.191
John Bourdain dies here?

33:13.192 --> 33:14.026
Yes.

33:14.027 --> 33:19.430
An adult natural of France by

33:19.431 --> 33:21.932
the name of John Bourdain.

33:21.933 --> 33:22.768
Cause of death.

33:22.769 --> 33:24.202
Not specified here.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.071
Is there a grave site?

33:26.072 --> 33:26.472
We're looking.

33:26.473 --> 33:31.077
We are looking for it.

34:12.418 --> 34:13.751
So I'm hungry.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.453
I'm really hungry.

34:15.454 --> 34:18.489
You know you want it.

34:18.489 --> 34:18.757
It's late.

34:18.757 --> 34:19.989
You had a few.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.759
No, you had a lot.

34:21.760 --> 34:26.764
You want something greasy,
savory, juicy and nasty.

34:26.764 --> 34:28.766
This is it.

34:28.766 --> 34:29.534
Right.

34:29.536 --> 34:37.536
That's what today's people
eat in the streets.

34:37.543 --> 34:44.715
An egg a little runny please.

34:44.716 --> 34:48.386
Soy sauce I think too.

34:48.387 --> 34:52.623
Like the ruins of ancient Troy,

34:52.623 --> 34:54.559
egg on top of cheese
on top of meat.

34:54.560 --> 35:02.560
Now get in my stomach now.

35:10.176 --> 35:11.309
Awesome.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.877
Really awesome.

35:12.878 --> 35:15.480
And the last thing I give a

35:15.481 --> 35:18.249
steaming loaf about anymore,
I mean, I am over it.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.418
Here comes news of the
big break through.

35:20.419 --> 35:21.986
I talked with the historian

35:21.987 --> 35:25.490
and he says it looks like your

35:25.491 --> 35:27.692
great grandfather what he was

35:27.693 --> 35:29.327
merchandising it was
definitely not hats.

35:29.328 --> 35:33.331
Really?

35:33.332 --> 35:35.666
We have here Bourdain.

35:35.667 --> 35:36.001
Right.

35:36.002 --> 35:42.340
And what is he bringing?

35:42.341 --> 35:43.341
Like fire crackers?

35:43.342 --> 35:46.244
There is not even more than

35:46.245 --> 35:49.580
200 or 300 wealthy families who

35:49.581 --> 35:54.185
sometimes in a birthday
would crack a little bit.

35:54.186 --> 35:57.288
Are you suggesting
something untoward?

35:57.289 --> 35:59.190
Weapons.

35:59.191 --> 36:02.693
Weapons?

36:02.694 --> 36:02.961
Yeah.

36:02.962 --> 36:04.629
Awesome.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.198
My aunt always said
he was a gun runner.

36:07.199 --> 36:11.902
We figured she was full of shit.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.371
She also said she was in the

36:13.372 --> 36:16.374
resistance, but everybody
in France said that.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.476
So, arms.

36:18.477 --> 36:22.146
Was he a hat-maker slash arms...

36:22.147 --> 36:26.284
Are all these historians and
gene uses on the money?

36:26.285 --> 36:33.391
Was great grampy an arms dealer?

36:33.392 --> 36:39.664
What hat makers needs 200
pounds of gun powder?

36:39.665 --> 36:40.065
I've got you now.

36:40.066 --> 36:42.767
I've got you now.

36:42.768 --> 36:46.003
Or was he a party supplier,

36:46.004 --> 36:48.906
selling fine French hats and fik

36:48.907 --> 36:51.108
crackers to school kids?

36:51.109 --> 36:53.278
I don't know what to believe.

36:53.279 --> 36:58.249
And in '58, he died.

36:58.250 --> 36:58.817
Right.

36:58.818 --> 37:02.853
And he was buried, here, two

37:02.854 --> 37:07.825
miles from here in the
rich people's cemetery.

37:07.826 --> 37:15.826
We can pretty well say in
which area he remains.

37:21.540 --> 37:25.776
He is there.

37:25.777 --> 37:31.282
Wow.

37:31.283 --> 37:35.453
Well, I guess we'll
have to go look, huh?

37:35.454 --> 37:38.424
Definitely.

38:07.319 --> 38:12.222
Sorry little buddy
there's no escaping it.

38:12.223 --> 38:14.359
Paraguay loves their beef.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.862
Perfect ratio, lot of meat,
little bit of vegetables.

38:17.863 --> 38:18.263
Perfect.

38:18.264 --> 38:20.331
Oh, whoa, that's good.

38:20.332 --> 38:27.105
This is the.

38:28.574 --> 38:31.008
A sprawling ranch and it's been

38:31.009 --> 38:33.010
in the family back to the war.

38:33.011 --> 38:33.579
Hard life?

38:33.580 --> 38:37.682
No, we are happy.

38:37.683 --> 38:38.617
We have everything.

38:38.618 --> 38:44.088
20 years ago, it was not used.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.756
In the last years, it's booming.

38:45.757 --> 38:48.493
Where does the boom come from?

38:48.494 --> 38:51.128
We are the second biggest

38:51.129 --> 38:57.201
soybean exporter, eighth
biggest cattle supporter.

38:57.202 --> 39:01.472
Paraguay feeds the entire
world for eight days a year.

39:01.473 --> 39:06.977
How many acres?

39:06.978 --> 39:10.114
100,000 hectares.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.549
I could eat this all day.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.918
And I will.

39:13.919 --> 39:17.287
Barbecue.

39:17.288 --> 39:19.290
You are complete.

39:22.628 --> 39:30.628
It's good.

39:31.437 --> 39:34.939
â™ª

39:34.940 --> 39:42.940
â™ª

39:47.252 --> 39:50.688
Mmm, that's awesome.

39:50.689 --> 39:56.594
So were there a lot of
vegetarians in this part of

39:56.595 --> 39:56.962
Paraguay?

39:57.262 --> 39:59.196
Here comes the highlight.

39:59.197 --> 40:03.468
Oh, look at that.

40:03.469 --> 40:04.002
Pretty.

40:04.003 --> 40:11.942
Beef short ribs are amazing.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.679
Mmm, so good.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.013
â™ª

40:15.014 --> 40:19.950
All of the books I read about

40:19.951 --> 40:25.456
Paraguay are maybe 15 years old.

40:25.457 --> 40:28.894
The first thing, everybody
has to go and buy a gun.

40:35.300 --> 40:41.405
This was not the Paraguay
I expected at all.

40:41.406 --> 40:44.308
He wants to sing a song for you.

40:44.309 --> 40:50.815
A welcome song.

40:50.816 --> 40:51.916
â™ª

40:51.917 --> 40:59.917
â™ª

41:01.560 --> 41:07.498
It not say welcome stranger.

41:07.499 --> 41:15.499
It says welcome
brother stranger.

41:16.675 --> 41:19.209
â™ª

41:19.210 --> 41:27.210
â™ª

41:30.221 --> 41:37.862
The man who died here was
my great grandfather.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.230
Yes.

41:40.231 --> 41:43.233
This old cemetery.

41:43.234 --> 41:51.234
It seems most likely that
he was buried there.

42:00.251 --> 42:08.251
â™ª

42:13.298 --> 42:15.900
Nobody I know.

42:15.901 --> 42:19.169
It's very, very likely that

42:19.170 --> 42:25.409
the tomb was just overbuilt.

42:25.410 --> 42:26.577
Right.

42:26.578 --> 42:30.848
Something on top.

42:30.849 --> 42:31.316
