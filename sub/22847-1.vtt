00:01.210 --> 00:03.337
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.462 --> 00:05.006
We were all in the Framework together.

00:05.131 --> 00:07.133
<i>We all lost ourselves in there.</i>

00:07.258 --> 00:10.594
<i>No, this is my fault.
Aida, the LMDs, all the deaths.</i>

00:10.761 --> 00:12.388
<i>Those aren't on S.H.I.E.L.D.
Those are on me.</i>

00:12.638 --> 00:16.017
If there's a price to pay,
we pay it together.

00:16.142 --> 00:17.143
Amen.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.103
Anybody else hungry?

00:19.270 --> 00:21.522
I'm not saying we're definitely gonna get
locked up, but if we are,

00:21.647 --> 00:23.274
<i>wouldn't mind grabbing a bite
to eat first.</i>

00:27.403 --> 00:29.196
- Phillip J. Coulson.
- Yep.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.744
The window closes
in less than two minutes. Take them.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.298
Haven't done one of these in a while.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.260
You?

04:21.095 --> 04:24.390
My wife thinks I'm at a friend's house
for our fantasy draft.

04:26.141 --> 04:29.144
Doesn't even occur to her
that we're in the middle of the season.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.732
Doesn't even occur to her.

04:40.489 --> 04:41.740
We left one sitting at the counter, sir.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.118
Yeah. Not on the list.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.189
And the coat pockets.
Clean it up, please.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.651
Watch the clock.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.529
The moment is fast approaching,
everybody.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.038
Is everyone all right?

05:30.456 --> 05:32.207
Yeah, I think so.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.540
Are you out of your skull?

06:54.623 --> 06:56.458
What the hell are you doing,
blowing the damn window?

06:57.418 --> 06:58.627
It's called improvisation.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.295
You suicidal?
Do you want to be a vacancy?

07:00.462 --> 07:02.172
I couldn't see another way
to kill that thing.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.300
We're safe now, okay? Quit howling.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.262
The other guy I hired isn't safe.
He's frozen in the vacuum of space.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.347
Yeah, well, I'll take his cut too.

07:10.806 --> 07:12.307
Relax. You can keep his rations.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.268
- Hi.
- What in the hell?

07:14.435 --> 07:15.436
Don't shoot. Thanks.

07:16.645 --> 07:17.980
Oh, my God.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.149
My God, you're here.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.652
That I'm slowly figuring out. Sorry,
I... I think I might be a little confused.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.821
Disoriented, of course.
It's quite a journey.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.408
I didn't know how you travelled here,
but I knew it wasn't gonna be first class.

07:32.035 --> 07:35.873
You're here. Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D.
You've come to save us.

07:36.165 --> 07:39.668
Yeah, just to clarify, where is here,
who is us and from what?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.422
Move! Let's go!

07:43.755 --> 07:45.549
- Is this the whole shipment, Virgil?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

07:45.716 --> 07:47.259
- Go!
- Where are the others? Wait!

07:47.509 --> 07:49.553
Where are the others? You weren't
the only one to travel through, were you?

07:49.678 --> 07:51.346
I don't think so. Um. I'm sorry,
what was that?

07:51.555 --> 07:53.265
The gravitational flux must've messed
with your entry.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.683
We got to wait for the rest of them, okay?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.977
You'll have to triple my tokens
to get me to stay a minute longer.

07:57.561 --> 08:00.314
One of those Roaches gets us,
you'll pay me to shoot you in the head.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.908
Get back, get back! Stay back. Shh!

08:11.033 --> 08:12.701
All right, all right, that's enough.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.745
Can we... I'd like to know,
if you don't mind,

08:14.870 --> 08:18.332
- what is happening here, please.
- Okay. Yeah. Sorry.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.959
I... I didn't know how much you would know
about our current situation coming in.

08:21.084 --> 08:24.505
Zero! Walk me through it like I'm a child,
like I'm a foreign child.

08:24.630 --> 08:25.714
What was that thing?

08:25.881 --> 08:29.092
Right. Right. That was a Vrellnexian.
We call them Roaches.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.385
They can surf gravity storms

08:30.552 --> 08:32.386
so they'd be able to breach
a few years back.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.890
This level's been sealed up
ever since then.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.558
- It's my first time here.
- And who are you?

08:38.644 --> 08:41.563
Right, sorry. Stupid me.
My name is Virgil.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.107
I'm the greeting party and a fan.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.860
Great to have a name, Virgil,
but looking for big picture here.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.696
- I mean, who are you?
- I'm one of the true believers.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.657
Believers in what?

08:52.574 --> 08:53.617
In you.

08:56.995 --> 08:57.996
Mack!

08:59.206 --> 09:01.458
You okay? What the hell is going on?

09:01.583 --> 09:02.918
I was about to find out.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.754
Oh, my bad. I see a dirty-looking dude
hovering over you

09:05.921 --> 09:08.257
with a crazy-looking gun.
I acted on impulse.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.801
Where'd that rock send us?

09:11.009 --> 09:13.470
Well, I don't have many details,
but I do know we're in space.

09:15.347 --> 09:18.517
Yeah, that makes sense.
That's the one thing we haven't done yet.

09:19.643 --> 09:23.272
All right, so, where's everyone else?

09:36.034 --> 09:37.452
Wait. Yo...

09:40.205 --> 09:43.041
- No, Yo-Yo, wait! It's me.
- Simmons?

09:45.127 --> 09:47.754
What on Earth were you...
I'm lucky there were no knives.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.298
What the hell were you doing
with that mask,

09:49.423 --> 09:50.799
trying to give me a heart attack?

09:50.966 --> 09:53.468
Well, I wasn't sure
the air was safe in here.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.349
They were trying to get out.
I thought maybe it was for air

09:59.474 --> 10:01.977
when I saw this mask on the ground,
but I guess not.

10:07.399 --> 10:10.527
Do you really...
Is that the smartest thing?

10:10.736 --> 10:12.654
They're already dead. There's nothing
to be scared of.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.239
No. Of course not.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.162
Oh, that looks like Momia Juanita
from the In...

10:20.287 --> 10:21.830
The Incan mummies, yeah.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.042
These people have been dead
for a long while, but...

10:25.542 --> 10:28.670
their bodies seem absent
all interstitial fluid. It's completely...

10:29.713 --> 10:31.715
dehydrated them, preserving them.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.218
Dehydrated how? Frozen?

10:36.511 --> 10:37.512
No.

10:38.847 --> 10:39.848
Drained.

10:40.849 --> 10:44.061
Oh. "They're already dead.
There's nothing to be scared of."

10:44.186 --> 10:47.105
- Really? What sucks a human dry?
- Aliens.

10:49.524 --> 10:50.567
Mack.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.657
I'm happy to see you too,
but I'm not happy you're here.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.035
- Aliens.
- Yep.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.205
Coulson's 99 percent sure we're in space.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.873
Not again.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.169
All right. Any idea which part
of space we're in?

11:09.961 --> 11:11.338
Uh... Outer?

11:12.297 --> 11:15.258
- And you saw an alien?
- No. We saw what they can do.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.845
So we have no idea what kind of creature
these people are trying to get away from.

11:19.054 --> 11:22.057
Question I'm asking is,
who locked them in?

12:46.183 --> 12:48.018
'Cause this wasn't fun enough.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.674
- It's stupid. Just stupid.
- All right. I get it.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.594
Look, I'm just saying, what good is it
having a state-of-the-art robotic hand

13:22.719 --> 13:24.679
if you don't have it on you
when you're kidnapped by Martians?

13:24.805 --> 13:26.556
Looks like he's got both hands to me.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.058
That's his civvy hand.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.519
It's just a prosthetic
without all the cool doodads.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.563
Maybe, it should've been a hook.
At least you can stab things with a hook.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.232
- Thought I was gonna be arrested.
- So, wait,

13:35.357 --> 13:36.775
that one doesn't have the blowtorch

13:36.858 --> 13:39.694
- or the laser gun or anything?
- First of all, I'm not Inspector Gadget.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.322
And second of all, the authorities
would've confiscated it.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.407
Prison's bad enough without being down
an appendage.

13:44.533 --> 13:47.702
First rule of Boy Scouts is,
always come prepared.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.913
How were we supposed to prepare for this,
Mack?

13:50.038 --> 13:51.164
I don't know.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.458
I mean, we got to be prepared
for everything, apparently.

13:53.625 --> 13:57.212
Look, not a day ago, I was trapped inside
a computer-generated mind prison,

13:57.337 --> 14:00.423
and now... You know what?
You know, Coulson? I'm out. I'm out.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.093
We get through this, I am packing it in.

14:03.260 --> 14:06.263
- Sorry, Mack. You already quit years ago.
- Yeah, well, I didn't quit hard enough.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.223
Look, I am not comfortable at the pace
at which we deal

14:08.348 --> 14:09.432
with new trials and tribulations.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.560
Believe it or not, Mack,
this isn't new for me.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.812
I've been hurled through space
by a monolith before.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.481
Best we can do is keep our heads
and apply the scientific method.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.401
That's right. Learn what we can
about our circumstances.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.819
So, are these people human?

14:20.944 --> 14:23.780
Humanoid, at least. Means we aren't
the first ones here. That's good.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.741
Is it? We don't exactly want to follow
in their footsteps.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.744
They've got no IDs.
Fury never said anything

14:29.911 --> 14:32.038
about deep-space outposts
being developed, did he?

14:32.163 --> 14:33.790
There was nothing like this
in his black box.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.751
So, wait, S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't have
a space division

14:36.877 --> 14:38.253
called S.P.E.A.R. or something?

14:39.671 --> 14:42.883
Really? I always thought you guys had
people hiding on the moon.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.593
Hey! Wake up!

14:45.135 --> 14:47.304
Geez, Mack, how hard did you hit him?

14:48.597 --> 14:51.433
What do you mean?
As hard as I possibly could.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.227
Look, I don't half-hit people.
It's a punch.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.730
- That's why it's called a punch.
- What did he say before that?

14:56.980 --> 14:59.482
He said that we were coming here
to serve a purpose.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.359
- As food?
- No.

15:01.943 --> 15:05.113
He said we were here to save them.
Any idea what that is?

15:06.448 --> 15:07.449
No.

15:10.869 --> 15:11.995
Here we go.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.081
Well...

15:15.957 --> 15:18.376
- looks like he's from Earth.
- Or he ate someone from Earth.

15:18.627 --> 15:19.878
So, it is a human outpost.

15:20.045 --> 15:24.299
Yeah, and of course it's being overrun
by creatures that suck out your innards.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.468
I should've been a fireman.

16:07.842 --> 16:12.597
Hey. Hey. Uh... How long have I been out?

16:12.889 --> 16:15.350
We can't... We can't linger here.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.812
Yeah, sorry. Mack thought you were
an imminent threat.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.442
Alphonso "Mack" Mackenzie.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.529
Oh, it's good to meet you.

16:28.405 --> 16:31.199
- How do you know me?
- Oh, I know all of you.

16:32.367 --> 16:35.578
Yo-Yo Rodriguez.
Is it okay if I call you Yo-Yo?

16:36.204 --> 16:37.872
- No.
- Okay.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.584
Jemma Simmons, biochemistry.

16:42.127 --> 16:45.588
I'm sorry Fitz didn't get to make
the trip, but he is thinking of you.

16:46.047 --> 16:48.133
Hey! How do you know us?

16:49.175 --> 16:54.389
I've been studying you for years,
your history. I mean, I always believed.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.726
I mean, I had moments, but they...

16:58.727 --> 17:01.229
they tried to take that last bit away
from me,

17:01.354 --> 17:03.231
but I always believed
the stories were true.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.441
What stories?

17:05.483 --> 17:07.777
This one, that you would...
you would come.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.780
To save you, Virgil, from those aliens
that were attacking?

17:10.905 --> 17:14.117
No, those... No. The... the Roaches are
an anomaly, a glitch in the plan.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.744
Don't be crazy.
You're not here to save me.

17:16.953 --> 17:17.996
Who, then?

17:19.414 --> 17:20.457
Humanity.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.588
I'm sorry. This is a lot to dump
on your plate, but...

17:27.005 --> 17:28.339
how do you eat an elephant, right?

17:30.592 --> 17:31.760
This will make a lot more sense,

17:31.926 --> 17:33.970
once I show you...

17:37.265 --> 17:38.975
Got to let that guy finish his sentence.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.777
Go. Go!

17:51.488 --> 17:52.572
Go.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.305
Right?

18:17.806 --> 18:21.351
Yes, that was right, and not the only one.

19:37.886 --> 19:39.470
I've been looking for you.

19:53.568 --> 19:56.237
You know, I didn't want to hurt you,
but the idea is starting to grow on me.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.828
- I deserve better than this.
- Tell that to the corpses.

20:23.681 --> 20:24.682
Damn.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.770
I was not prepared for that,
I got to admit.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.982
You pack a big punch
for such a small package.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.985
I got to read the fine print next time.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.448
I hate wasting the charge on that thing.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.201
And honestly, I wasn't trying to hurt you,

20:43.993 --> 20:46.579
but you had a lead pipe at the ready,
and I can't...

20:50.750 --> 20:54.087
Okay. I guess we'll stick
with the first impression.

20:57.882 --> 21:02.178
I don't know what you did to these people
or why I was dragged here, but...

21:04.639 --> 21:07.016
Save it. The less I know, the better.

21:13.898 --> 21:18.319
So, is there anything you want to fill us
in on, Coulson? 'Cause now's the time.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.823
- You know what I know.
- This doesn't have anything to do

21:21.948 --> 21:23.741
with the little bargain that you made
with the Ghost Rider?

21:23.866 --> 21:26.077
Yeah, that thing doesn't ride for free.
There has to be some price.

21:26.202 --> 21:29.622
Nope. This is all new to me.
Sorry. It's... That's just the reality.

21:30.164 --> 21:31.916
Well, maybe this isn't reality.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.379
Maybe someone put us back in the Framework
and this is a simulation.

21:36.504 --> 21:37.714
Please, we have to shut up about that.

21:37.839 --> 21:38.965
Oh, my God,

21:39.048 --> 21:41.009
if I even think about that,
my brain will explode.

21:41.134 --> 21:43.720
Again, let's not just postulate.
Let's apply scientific principles

21:43.845 --> 21:45.054
and consider the evidence we have.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.849
Look, this is magic, okay? Can we all
agree there's some magic at play?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.851
Magic is just science
we don't understand yet.

21:49.976 --> 21:53.146
Ah, please. We just got zapped
through space by Stonehenge,

21:53.271 --> 21:56.357
and we're trying to rule out involvement
of a flame-headed demon from East L.A.?

21:57.025 --> 22:00.570
Science, my ass. Now let me see that gun.
Maybe I can try to get it working.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.989
Fitz would agree,
but apparently, he didn't get taken.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.450
No. At least he wasn't in the room
with the monolith.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.577
I was the last to go through.
I saw it all.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.620
Well, that's some relief.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.498
He's safe from this,
better off than we are.

22:12.707 --> 22:16.085
- Yeah. You okay?
- Fine.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.838
What, do you think he isn't better off?
He has to be.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.715
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- Or that he did something drastic?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.717
He wouldn't do that.
He was right there with us at the diner.

22:22.842 --> 22:26.220
No, I'm not saying any of that. It's just
you guys are constantly torn apart.

22:26.471 --> 22:30.016
Cursed, as he would say.
Well, I'm not afraid that he isn't here.

22:30.433 --> 22:33.519
I'm thrilled. He's no doubt
working this problem,

22:33.644 --> 22:35.355
probably trying to get a message
to us right now.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.898
Better for everyone he isn't here.

22:37.023 --> 22:40.651
Yeah, well, May did get pulled through.
I saw it. So we should find her.

22:40.777 --> 22:41.819
We should split up.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.112
- Aw, hell, no. No, no.
- Yeah...

22:43.237 --> 22:46.074
We are sticking together 100 percent.
Haven't you ever seen an alien movie?

22:46.240 --> 22:48.117
Mack, it's the best way to cover
the most ground.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.912
Okay, you see, you see, that's exactly
what they say

22:51.037 --> 22:54.165
before they get picked off one by one,
and you know who the first one will be.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.044
It's your call, boss.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.136
This has to be the coolest
we've ever looked.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.363
That should keep the Roaches away
for a while.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.240
Smell drives them nuts, I think.

23:28.491 --> 23:32.286
But you kick me again, and I'm gonna
leave you to be their dessert.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.796
Now this is gonna hurt like hell, but...

23:42.964 --> 23:44.966
it's better than the other way
we can do it.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.645
I don't know where you flushed out of,

23:57.770 --> 24:00.523
but in this sector, you can't go 10 feet
without a Metric.

24:03.151 --> 24:07.822
Hey. Don't move. One inch the wrong way,
and you're a vacancy.

24:28.176 --> 24:30.344
Yo-Yo, you want to scout up ahead?

24:33.723 --> 24:35.266
All clear for now.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.731
Seems like it's just a lot of work
just to keep this place afloat.

24:41.856 --> 24:45.568
But it's designed for humans to survive,
atmosphere and simulated gravity

24:45.693 --> 24:48.237
and the machinery seemed to be
for reclaiming water, I think.

24:48.362 --> 24:49.697
Yeah, it looks man-made.

24:50.698 --> 24:53.826
Could possibly be a colony?
Moving mankind to the stars?

24:53.951 --> 24:55.786
Maybe that's what Virgil meant
by "humanity."

24:55.912 --> 24:57.830
I don't know. That plasma gun
wasn't man-made,

24:57.955 --> 25:00.625
and I don't think they could've built
this place without some outside help.

25:01.459 --> 25:04.712
- Got some serious miles on it.
- Decades by the looks of it.

25:05.463 --> 25:08.257
Means this program would've had to have
been started back in the, what,

25:08.758 --> 25:11.928
'80s with Howard Stark?
That doesn't feel right.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.181
Yo-Yo found something.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.292
Nothing.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.127
Nothing alive.

25:51.884 --> 25:52.927
Hey.

25:58.849 --> 26:00.226
They didn't get to her, did they?

26:00.601 --> 26:03.813
May would've put up a fight.
And they left the other bodies here.

26:05.106 --> 26:06.107
"Water reclamation."

26:07.275 --> 26:08.359
You were right, Jemma.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.279
I figured it out using magic.

26:13.614 --> 26:17.285
We can try and find a layout
and track May.

26:18.286 --> 26:22.582
It's in English. They're tracking
debris fields called "frozen oceans."

26:25.585 --> 26:28.087
They're collecting water from ice
in space. This is a colony.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.256
Which means unless they all came through
a monolith...

26:30.381 --> 26:32.842
Then we're close enough to Earth
for people to travel here.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.303
- And we can get home.
- Yes, but just as important,

26:35.761 --> 26:37.555
collecting ice means they have
a spacecraft,

26:37.680 --> 26:39.390
and if they have a spacecraft,
they must have

26:39.515 --> 26:41.225
a laser-based rapid-transmission system.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.102
If we can find the ship and fly above
the debris field...

26:43.227 --> 26:44.312
We can send a message.

26:44.437 --> 26:45.730
...we can send a message to Fitz
back on Earth.

26:45.855 --> 26:50.651
Okay, okay, so if I can find a layout,
find a ship, find May, it's a start.

26:52.153 --> 26:54.822
This interface looks similar to...

26:59.368 --> 27:01.078
Coulson, do you recognise this language?

27:03.331 --> 27:04.373
No.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.710
I don't think humans are running
this place after all.

27:35.863 --> 27:38.491
Mack? Yo-Yo?

27:50.086 --> 27:51.087
Hey.

27:51.796 --> 27:53.297
What are you gonna do with our friends?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.383
Whatever we want.

27:55.758 --> 27:59.595
Experiment. They knew the rule
and they broke it.

28:01.222 --> 28:02.848
They're not gonna make it easy for you.

28:07.895 --> 28:12.525
No. They'll beg for their lives
as you humans always do.

28:13.067 --> 28:17.321
I've done 22 rotations
and I have never observed anything else.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.542
It's great to get some alone time
with you, but...

28:30.793 --> 28:33.921
I really wish you had run away
with your super-speed instead.

28:34.964 --> 28:38.050
Yeah, you forget I snap back
to where I started.

28:38.718 --> 28:42.555
Sometimes it's very useful,
but other times, it's super annoying.

28:51.772 --> 28:52.898
You speak English?

28:54.275 --> 28:55.317
Of course.

28:57.445 --> 28:58.612
Let her go.

29:00.114 --> 29:01.323
She didn't do anything.

29:13.544 --> 29:17.298
I said we speak English.
That doesn't mean I want to hear it.

29:30.311 --> 29:31.562
Okay. New theory.

29:32.188 --> 29:35.149
The Kree have been abducting humans
to this outpost for years.

29:35.441 --> 29:36.609
Running experiments?

29:36.817 --> 29:39.069
Well, their genetic work
in creating Inhumans is well-known.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.488
Maybe they're doing more of the same.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.698
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna wait around
to find out. So...

29:46.327 --> 29:47.369
May.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.209
Buddy!
Just go with it.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.294
I've been looking everywhere for you guys.

29:55.419 --> 29:58.547
Man, what a mess back there, huh?

29:59.673 --> 30:02.426
These poor suckers.
Virgil... you know, from R&R?

30:02.551 --> 30:04.678
He was trying to scam these guys out
of some tokens.

30:05.012 --> 30:09.683
This one came running to me
begging for help, the poor thing.

30:09.850 --> 30:12.728
When I get my hands on that no-good louse,
he's gonna have some explaining to do.

30:12.853 --> 30:15.064
- So where is Virgil, anyway?
- He's dead.

30:16.565 --> 30:17.566
Good.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.112
Good. Got what he deserved then,
didn't he?

30:22.863 --> 30:25.533
For trying to drag these poor transfers

30:25.699 --> 30:28.702
up from processing into the wet works
just to steal their Metrics.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.206
So, he's just Roach food then, huh?

30:32.331 --> 30:33.374
Oh, yeah.

30:33.707 --> 30:36.752
- One more vacancy, right?
- That's what I was gonna say.

30:37.044 --> 30:41.048
Guys, what did I say
about trusting Virgil, huh?

30:41.215 --> 30:42.716
We went over this. What did I say?

30:43.759 --> 30:45.177
- Don't trust Virgil.
- Not to trust him.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.930
God, you repeated it back to me,
and we said back...

30:48.055 --> 30:49.765
It was like a pass-and-catch thing.

30:50.140 --> 30:51.976
Look, I really appreciate your help
with these guys,

30:52.101 --> 30:53.227
but I can take them off your hands,

30:53.394 --> 30:55.396
and then I'll slip you a few extra tokens
for your trouble.

30:59.024 --> 31:03.779
Listen, I'll be... I'll be honest
with you, man to... more than a man.

31:03.904 --> 31:07.157
If I don't get these guys back
to processing at warp speed,

31:07.283 --> 31:10.494
I am gonna be in some pretty hot water.
So I know it's not ideal, but...

31:13.122 --> 31:14.123
Look, if you...

31:14.999 --> 31:17.585
if you come by the gallery
for an hour or two...

31:18.419 --> 31:20.212
I'll make it worth your while, all right?

31:27.720 --> 31:30.973
All good, gang. So, single file.

32:34.244 --> 32:35.371
We'll spare you...

32:36.288 --> 32:39.833
to provide us greater satisfaction
than killing you would bring.

33:01.230 --> 33:03.524
She'll pay that price for you.

33:06.443 --> 33:12.783
Stop! Stop! No! No!

33:17.121 --> 33:19.999
- You good?
- Banged up, but okay.

33:20.791 --> 33:21.834
We in space?

33:22.042 --> 33:24.211
- That's affirmative.
- Copy that.

33:28.757 --> 33:31.051
What the hell happened to Virgil?
The Roaches get him?

33:31.385 --> 33:33.220
Sorry to say. Was he a friend?

33:34.555 --> 33:37.599
Acquaintance. He owed me a ton of tokens
for this job.

33:38.308 --> 33:39.309
Job?

33:39.518 --> 33:42.896
All he said was that he wanted to hide
some people. That's not unheard of.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.898
So, I was hired to supply the Metrics
and swap them out,

33:45.024 --> 33:47.860
but you guys don't even have Metrics,
which means that you don't have the tokens

33:47.985 --> 33:49.737
to cover Virgil's end, so have fun.

33:49.862 --> 33:51.613
Hey, wait, wait. We need your help.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.366
We need to find our friends.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.327
Your friends?

33:58.829 --> 34:02.124
Your friends attacked a Kreeper.
They're as good as gone.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.376
Those blues are bred to kill
so you just...

34:04.501 --> 34:07.004
- You make your peace with it.
- We'll take our chances.

34:07.755 --> 34:11.091
Listen, if you could help us find them
and then get to the spacecraft...

34:11.216 --> 34:13.510
You mean the Trawler? To do what?

34:14.762 --> 34:19.016
The only pilot I knew was Virgil,
may he rest in peace, apparently.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.393
So best of luck to all you guys,
but mine's running out.

34:22.518 --> 34:23.603
You got a name?

34:25.022 --> 34:27.065
Deke.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.860
Well, Deke, we just wanted pie,

34:30.444 --> 34:32.737
and now we don't know where we are
or what's going on,

34:32.905 --> 34:35.949
and we finally found someone who does,
so you're not walking away.

34:41.955 --> 34:44.208
Where's the Trawler?

34:46.502 --> 34:48.795
Take a lift down to level nine.
You can't miss it.

34:49.838 --> 34:53.467
May, take Simmons. Get that spacecraft
in the air. Send out the signal.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.844
Daisy and I will find Mack and Yo-Yo.

34:56.136 --> 34:58.305
- No, no, wait. You stay here.
- What?

34:58.597 --> 35:01.308
I've got two good fighters down there once
I get the restraints off. I'll be fine.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.811
We can't lose our leader again.
We need answers.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.021
You want me to stay here
and grill this guy?

35:06.146 --> 35:09.483
Find out where the hell
and what the hell... sir.

35:13.821 --> 35:14.988
Good plan.

35:16.115 --> 35:17.741
What do the Kree want with us, Deke?

35:18.826 --> 35:19.993
All they ever want...

35:21.995 --> 35:23.080
submission.

35:39.346 --> 35:42.474
- How many Kree live here?
- Too many.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.230
Think about it.

35:48.730 --> 35:52.025
The Kree have been studying humans
for years, moving here in large numbers.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.319
Kree who were bred to kill.

35:54.444 --> 35:57.531
Bred to kill and living
within striking distance of Earth.

35:59.533 --> 36:00.951
This isn't an outpost, May.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.870
It's a staging ground.

36:04.121 --> 36:05.581
They're planning an invasion.

36:50.083 --> 36:53.045
What do you mean "submission"?
Are the Kree planning some sort of attack?

36:53.170 --> 36:55.714
- Attack on whom exactly?
- Humans.

36:55.923 --> 36:57.341
Why would they do that?

36:57.466 --> 36:59.051
Stop!

36:59.176 --> 37:00.677
Please! I'll do anything! Just stop!

37:00.802 --> 37:03.263
Quiet, or we'll change our minds
about you.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.164
Can you start her up?

37:32.918 --> 37:36.672
That's the ignition port, I think,
but, uh, we obviously don't have the key.

37:37.256 --> 37:41.051
What are the chances of them
leaving it in here? Wait.

37:54.231 --> 37:56.191
Well, that worked out.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.068
Have you ever flown a spaceship?

37:58.819 --> 38:00.654
You know the answer to that question.

38:26.930 --> 38:30.851
I... have no words.

38:31.685 --> 38:32.978
Don't need them.

38:37.357 --> 38:38.900
So, then why did the Kree build
this place?

38:39.067 --> 38:41.028
They didn't build the bunker. Humans did.

38:41.236 --> 38:42.988
Why don't you know these things?

38:43.155 --> 38:45.073
Even in waste processing,
they know the history...

38:47.159 --> 38:48.702
You're not from processing, are you?

38:48.994 --> 38:52.331
No. I was enjoying a meal and then
I was taken and zapped to this place.

38:52.706 --> 38:54.291
- I'm from Earth.
- Yeah, well,

38:54.541 --> 38:57.169
that would be the one thing
that I do know, wing nut.

38:57.336 --> 39:00.422
- But from where? What area?
- Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.384
Are you high on something?
Can I have some?

39:29.576 --> 39:30.577
You okay?

39:30.744 --> 39:32.704
Thought you were gonna lose these
for a second there.

39:33.038 --> 39:35.415
I was starting to picture myself
with two hooks.

39:38.710 --> 39:39.753
Wait. Wait.

39:44.174 --> 39:47.386
Yeah, help me get him up.
We can gain access now,

39:47.761 --> 39:50.013
maybe talk to the Trawler ship,
find their location.

39:56.353 --> 39:59.189
We need to get up off this debris field
if we want a clear signal.

39:59.314 --> 40:01.316
Yeah, if I can figure out how to send one.

40:01.525 --> 40:04.736
I mean, the good news is,
I recognise some of these constellations,

40:04.861 --> 40:07.280
so we're... we're at least
in our own galaxy.

40:08.824 --> 40:10.033
That doesn't make sense.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.911
How long ago did they build this place
and when did you first come here?

40:13.036 --> 40:16.832
I don't know. They built it
90-some-odd years ago, minimum.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.626
But I... what do you mean come here?
I was born here.

40:21.294 --> 40:22.504
<i>Que pasa, Mack?</i>

40:23.046 --> 40:25.924
These... These filtration systems,

40:26.174 --> 40:28.802
they weren't designed for this.
They've been repurposed.

40:29.302 --> 40:32.681
Yeah, I feel like this machine's out
of its element, too.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.307
I found the coordinates to this place,

40:34.433 --> 40:37.102
but it's listing our location
in longitude and latitude.

40:39.980 --> 40:41.148
The postcard.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.493
Ninety years ago?
That... That's impossible.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.371
The tech in here couldn't have been
developed in the '20s.

40:57.164 --> 40:58.165
Wait.

40:59.666 --> 41:01.126
No Metrics, no scars...

41:02.043 --> 41:04.129
Wisconsin, pie.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.593
Tell me again about when you were taken?

41:10.385 --> 41:12.637
We were... We were sitting
in our favourite diner

41:12.846 --> 41:15.265
- just off Columbus Drive.
- Not... not where.

41:16.516 --> 41:17.642
When?

41:20.395 --> 41:21.521
What year?

41:23.523 --> 41:25.192
That monolith was different, wasn't it?

41:26.693 --> 41:28.361
We didn't travel through space.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.280
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

41:30.572 --> 41:31.781
I know, May.

41:33.700 --> 41:36.036
I recognise all of these constellations.

41:37.370 --> 41:38.455
I meant that.

41:53.470 --> 41:55.889
No reason to send a message back to Earth.

42:15.283 --> 42:16.576
We're already here.
