01:02.600 --> 01:04.300
- Good morning, Stash.
- Good morning.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.800
- Chase Research. Have you seen Paul?
- No, I haven't seen him.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.800
- From the train company?
- No, Maindrian Pace.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.800
I'm here to investigate the accident
for the insurance company.

01:29.200 --> 01:34.800
- What a way to start the day.
- I always get the heaviest jobs.

01:35.300 --> 01:40.800
- What have you found?
- Not much. Maybe a braking problem.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.900
- And the driver?
- He died in the hospital.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.200
It looks critical too
the brake also.

01:46.300 --> 01:49.200
- What do you think caused the accident?
- Can be anything.

01:49.500 --> 01:54.900
<i> - We hope to find a mechanical fault.
- If that's where we find it</i>

01:55.200 --> 01:56.900
<i> Do your best! </i>

01:57.300 --> 02:00.800
Take it home to the workshop.
That's how Taylor Webb gets to look at it

02:01.300 --> 02:03.800
<i> It's about time he did
get to learn the job</i>

02:04.100 --> 02:06.100
I stay and make sure
everything comes with it

02:08.300 --> 02:14.500
<i> Number 515. Detroit 9607. </i>

02:14.900 --> 02:20.200
Number 19.
Warrens 26899.

02:20.600 --> 02:27.400
Number 22. Taylor Webbs
used cars. $ 333.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.900
A Challenger -73 with number 22.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.300
Why don't they ever call you
kl. five in the morning?

02:55.500 --> 02:56.000
<i> Because I live healthy. </i>

02:56.300 --> 02:57.700
<i> I'll change that. </i>

02:58.000 --> 03:01.800
Tomorrow, at 5 you will have to investigate
why the truck collided with the train

03:02.300 --> 03:05.700
<i> If Stanley can help me. Two years in
the army gave him brain damage</i>

03:06.100 --> 03:10.700
<i> I'll learn the job next week. I
are unsure of what to move over</i>

03:11.100 --> 03:14.400
<i> Here's how:
Taylor Webb buys a scrap truck</i>

03:14.800 --> 03:18.900
<i> We dismantle it, save the chassis
the number and the engine. Dumping the rest</i>

03:19.100 --> 03:23.700
Then we steal an identical car and
replaces the chassis number

03:24.100 --> 03:27.300
<i> Never check the police or
the insurance companies like that? </i>

03:27.700 --> 03:34.000
<i> One of 5000. Do you know how many
is located in Los Angeles? Over two million</i>

03:36.600 --> 03:40.200
- Stanley, what's your new girl?
- Jill. Why? </ I>

03:40.500 --> 03:42.700
<i> We name the car after her,
because she is also a wreck</i>

03:42.800 --> 03:44.700
<i> Here is the key to the boot lid. </i>

03:44.800 --> 03:49.800
- How far has the car gone?
- 68915.10.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.000
<i> - What tires are on?
- Goodyear E 7814. </i>

03:57.400 --> 04:00.100
With one or two lines?
- Two

04:00.400 --> 04:05.000
<i> - I'm recruiting in the army.
- Good idea. Take Corlis with you</i>

04:05.300 --> 04:09.500
- Shut up!
- Just because his girl is in New York

04:39.600 --> 04:41.100
Come on!
Hurry up!

04:43.700 --> 04:47.500
Atlee, get the truck and make sure
that the scrap is loaded.

04:48.700 --> 04:51.100
Now we just need to steal
a similar car.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.900
Lock the car after you.
Don't leave things visible in the car

04:57.400 --> 05:00.100
Don't leave the parking ticket
in the car

05:54.900 --> 06:00.500
- How did you get to know Pace?
- I used to steal trucks.

06:00.900 --> 06:05.100
One day, Pace came and said that
he worked for an insurance company

06:05.500 --> 06:08.000
He wanted to investigate a truck
that I had bought

06:08.200 --> 06:14.200
He opened his portfolio and took
forward a picture of my car - like a wreck

06:14.700 --> 06:19.100
And he said, Do you know that you
can go to jail for car theft?

06:19.500 --> 06:22.900
Then I knew he saw me

06:23.200 --> 06:28.200
<i> Here I am, Jackson, an investigator
who steals cars</i>

06:28.600 --> 06:33.800
But now you're a professional. amateurs
ends up in a cell

06:34.200 --> 06:38.000
But But Stockton was a pro,
but went there

06:38.300 --> 06:38.800
<i> He started to linger. </i>

06:39.000 --> 06:42.900
<i> - It's impossible to neglect our business.
- Jill now belongs to the statistics</i>

06:43.300 --> 06:47.100
<i> One of the 32 percent
that will never be found</i>

06:47.400 --> 06:49.700
Hell, I gotta be in
Rest in 20 minutes! 

06:49.900 --> 06:52.100
- Should I come with you?
- I would come alone

06:52.300 --> 06:57.300
<i> For $ 400,000 I go alone.
See you later. Clean up here</i>

07:03.600 --> 07:07.800
Mr. Pace, our companions in Argentina
gave you good recommendations

07:08.100 --> 07:09.800
Thank you, Mr. Villos

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
<i> As you requested.
$ 200,000 in advance</i>

07:13.300 --> 07:19.500
A lot of money. The cars must be
in the harbor on Saturday

07:20.000 --> 07:26.800
<i> They must be there. I can not answer
for the consequences if you do not deliver!</i>

07:27.400 --> 07:31.300
- Don't worry, Mr. Villos.
- I do not.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.200
That's your problem.
Saturday, at five.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.200
Here is a list of
the code names of the cars.

07:43.600 --> 07:48.600
What was the name of the football player, you remember
the thefts from the transport company?

07:48.900 --> 07:51.700
- Willie Davies.
- Yes, he was.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.700
He drives a burgundy Rolls Royce.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.700
I want you to fix the information
we need, before Sunday.

08:04.100 --> 08:06.200
Here's how we do it.

08:08.400 --> 08:14.100
The first cars are two Stutz.
With the code names Donna and Karen.

08:14.400 --> 08:21.400
We may write more clearly later.
We write down all the code names here.

08:21.900 --> 08:26.000
You can blur the other one.
And then...

08:26.300 --> 08:30.000
Make sure our anonymous cars are
starting clear.

08:30.300 --> 08:33.200
Then shoot us
the airport, half past nine.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.900
Now they come!

09:02.300 --> 09:07.100
Hey, I've come to Kosciuszko
Club in Dunkirk, New York? 

09:07.500 --> 09:12.000
I have another BA call
Maindrian Pace ...

09:12.200 --> 09:14.300
from Atlee Jackson at
Chase Research

09:14.600 --> 09:18.000
- Do you want to pay the call?
- One moment

09:18.200 --> 09:21.600
- I have to look for him.
- I'm waiting

09:22.800 --> 09:26.900
- Maindrian Pace here.
- Do you accept a BA call?

09:27.300 --> 09:30.700
<I> Yes. Why a BA call?
Are you in jail, right?

09:31.000 --> 09:34.700
No, but we all will soon.
Have you gone crazy?

09:35.000 --> 09:39.600
48 cars. Of which nine Rolls Royce as well
seven limousines

09:40.000 --> 09:43.500
<i> They also want Parnelli Jones
Bronco. Four Ferraris ... </i>

09:43.800 --> 09:45.900
<i> What's the problem? </i>

09:46.000 --> 09:49.100
We can't steal
all the cars before Friday!

09:49.500 --> 09:52.700
We just need to clean them out, change
number plates and deliver to the port

09:53.000 --> 09:58.200
- We will need help.
- Eugene can shoot on honeymoon

09:58.500 --> 10:04.200
- Do you have to ask him for it? Good luck.
- Continue searching the insurance register ... 

10:04.600 --> 10:10.800
<i> - but I know where 25 of the cars are.
And you don't have to worry about Eugene</i>

10:39.600 --> 10:42.200
- What is it?
- We have a problem.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.700
We must deliver over 40
cars before Saturday.

10:45.900 --> 10:49.300
- What do you want me to do?
- Postpone honeymoon.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.800
I would love to help,
but the wedding!

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
You do not understand!

10:53.300 --> 10:56.400
We have to deliver 48 more cars
the port next week!

10:56.800 --> 11:00.000
Then we have our usual job
plus three insurance cases.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.300
Boring. Call me in three weeks
when I come back from London.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.800
- Listen!
- Take it easy.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.800
Not here, Maindrian.

11:10.200 --> 11:16.100
The police heard when your dad died
but your siblings covered up for you.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.800
It's time you tighten up!
We three can vote you out!

11:23.000 --> 11:26.700
If he is not present
planet, he's out!

11:29.600 --> 11:33.100
Why do you always argue?
with Eugene, Maindrian?

11:33.500 --> 11:37.200
We're not talking about him.
Just make sure he's on the plane, okay?

11:37.500 --> 11:41.700
- I saw a nice house, can we look at it?
- Yes, yes.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.100
I love you. It was my father's dream
that we would marry one beautiful day.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.900
- I know.
- I'm a good cook too.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.500
- You just want me to get thick.
- Yeah, so nobody else looks at you.

11:53.900 --> 11:56.700
- We have to fix the contract first.
- But afterwards?

11:56.900 --> 11:59.500
<i> - We talk about it then, okay?
- Do you promise?</i>

11:59.800 --> 12:03.700
- Should we look at the house then?
- We talk about it then.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.000
Mr. Eugene Chase.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.500
How is it?
Have you worked hard?

12:28.600 --> 12:32.200
- Hi, Atlee.
- You can't trust anyone?

12:36.800 --> 12:40.700
- Nice that you came, but I have to go.
- Where?

12:59.600 --> 13:03.300
- Rae, you can go with Jenny.
- OK see you.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.900
- Make sure Jenny comes home.
- Okay.

13:08.300 --> 13:12.300
- Is everyone ready?
- Wait a minute. That's where Eleanor stands.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.200
Let me take care of it.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.100
It sits in the spinal cord.
Can I take care of her?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.700
Do it.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.900
He let the key sit
left in the boot lid.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.100
Okay, Stash. Now we're driving! 

14:04.500 --> 14:06.700
- Thanks so much.
- May the Lord be with you.

14:14.300 --> 14:18.000
- What the hell...
- Excuse me, I thought it was my car.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.600
Wrong car ...

14:23.800 --> 14:30.500
Great fun! I just wanted to die!

14:32.200 --> 14:37.600
Do not worry. I took the registration
number. We turn around.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.500
- Trip shot.
- Okay, pay.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.000
I bet you
can't do it again.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.300
Double or nothing?

14:52.400 --> 14:55.000
Stop playing and come.

14:55.300 --> 14:59.200
This is our biggest
contract ever.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.700
I don't want us to do any
mistakes, so listen up!

15:01.900 --> 15:05.000
- Surely he looks good in gray hair?
- Like a stupid pole.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.000
Lucky not the mom
named me Atlee.

15:08.200 --> 15:14.900
Atlee, you've been with me for three years. Here is
Corlis wig. You work with him.

15:15.400 --> 15:19.000
Stash, here you get a cool thing
to get to know you.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.600
Here is the list of all code names.

15:20.900 --> 15:24.100
Study it and learn the names.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.300
From now on we only use
code names when we talk about the cars.

15:26.500 --> 15:30.800
Pumpkin, you check that
all the cars have the right address.

15:31.200 --> 15:35.800
Only use the phone as Atlee
connected at the neighbor's gear.

15:36.200 --> 15:43.000
- Come on, we only take insured cars.
- If you have any questions, please consult Pumpkin.

15:43.500 --> 15:47.000
Are the cars registered?
they are usually insured.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.300
I know the day has been long,
but we have some simple jobs at night.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.600
I've been told that
Eleanor is located in Torrance.

15:53.900 --> 15:58.400
I have found the Italian, I remember
that I saw Lyle Wagner in Playgirl.

15:58.800 --> 16:04.000
- Any more?
- Yes, Jones Bronco is at the race track.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.500
- You and Corlis take care of it.
- Okay.

16:06.800 --> 16:11.900
One more thing, all the personal stuff you find
the cars are put in bags and destroyed.

16:12.300 --> 16:15.400
Cameras and similar can otherwise be tracked.

16:15.700 --> 16:18.300
We have got new equipment in our bags.

16:18.700 --> 16:21.600
Make sure the police radio and communication
the radio is always switched on.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.800
Then we stay informed and
don't have to be surprised.

16:25.100 --> 16:30.800
- This is our new, compact cultivation.
- I'll show it to Corlis.

16:31.200 --> 16:35.800
Can you arrange the key codes,
so we don't have to break the lock.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.200
Especially to the foreign cars.

16:37.400 --> 16:41.200
Some questions? Good.
Let's go.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.200
- Atlee, go and get Corlis.
- Okay.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.700
- Don't take any risks now!
- I'm not a stupid pole.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.400
Jump in, Stash.

17:08.400 --> 17:13.599
Make sure the radio is always on.
Okay, then we go.

18:02.800 --> 18:09.700
<i> "Lock your car or something ... </i>

18:18.500 --> 18:25.400
<i> it's gone in 60 seconds. "</i>

18:56.400 --> 18:58.100
The dog wants out.

19:00.300 --> 19:04.700
- No, he's just there.
- Go out with the dog, Harold.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.800
"Go out with him".
Whining bitch.

19:17.100 --> 19:21.000
He pulls dirt into the house,
I don't want him in here!

19:21.300 --> 19:24.000
Come to the master.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.200
Stay out there with him!

19:28.500 --> 19:33.900
- I'm tired of the dog.
- You women are crazy!

19:35.500 --> 19:37.300
Don't knock on the door!

19:38.000 --> 19:40.200
Come on, let's go for a walk.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.700
Hello! It is my car!

20:01.300 --> 20:04.300
My car stolen?
Now you get ...

20:24.700 --> 20:27.700
- Stay aside!
- You get to drive around.

20:28.100 --> 20:31.200
- Drive up the sidewalk!
- He stole my car!

20:31.500 --> 20:35.600
What a lucky thing he didn't steal yours
girlfriend and your stupid dog!

21:07.900 --> 21:12.800
I'm pursuing a blue Plymouth
heading south.

21:13.200 --> 21:17.600
- Registration number unknown. Male driver.
<i> - Understood. All units:</i>

21:18.000 --> 21:24.300
<i> We're chasing a man driving a blue Plymouth!
Registration number unknown! </i>

21:24.800 --> 21:27.700
- The bowling went well tonight.
- Hope she starts playing for us.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.800
- Yes, she played really well!
- I knew it.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.800
Beware!

21:37.300 --> 21:42.100
The wanted vehicle has caused one
accident at Crenshaw, 210th Street

21:42.500 --> 21:45.100
<i> The vehicle is still traveling south. </i>

21:45.300 --> 21:48.700
<I> Copy that! All devices in
near Crenshaw:

21:49.100 --> 21:52.200
<i> A blue Plymouth is heading south! </i>

21:52.600 --> 21:57.000
<i> We are in contact with it
suspect vehicle! </i>

21:57.400 --> 22:00.500
<i> He is now driving towards Vaness. </i>

22:12.900 --> 22:16.000
He stole my car!

22:18.300 --> 22:22.200
I have not done anything!
He stole my car!

22:22.600 --> 22:26.100
- Break his arm on him!
- You make a mistake!

22:26.400 --> 22:29.700
My car gets away!

22:31.100 --> 22:33.600
It is my car! A yellow Mustang!

23:01.200 --> 23:06.700
- Did we get him? How did it go for them?
- They got no injuries.

23:07.100 --> 23:09.800
- See what you've done!
- That wasn't the point.

23:10.100 --> 23:13.600
He says his car was stolen.
Let's check it out.

23:13.900 --> 23:16.500
That sounds reasonable.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.200
It was an accident.

23:23.300 --> 23:28.300
- Mr. Smith, is that your yellow Mustang?
- What the hell is this doing?

23:28.700 --> 23:35.100
<i> There was a guy here,
he took it and stuck. Black-clad. </ I></i>

23:35.500 --> 23:39.100
Why else would I drive
around in pajamas?

23:39.500 --> 23:40.700
<i> I just wanted to go out with the dog! </i>

23:40.900 --> 23:47.800
- We return to the station.
<i> - Perceived. </i>

23:53.500 --> 23:55.200
Take it easy!

23:59.000 --> 24:03.200
- I closed the door. What do you want?
- Are you born in the country, right?

24:04.600 --> 24:07.200
I heard you left a car again?

24:08.600 --> 24:11.100
- Was that why you called?
- Yes, the woods.

24:11.400 --> 24:15.100
- Because of this.
- Why?

24:15.500 --> 24:18.800
I came upon it when I found it
the business card behind the sun shade.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.300
H.D Smith is Harold Dwight Smith.

24:22.700 --> 24:26.600
He is an insurance inspector at Candid!

24:26.800 --> 24:31.700
- What does it matter?
- He has tricked more people than you did.

24:32.200 --> 24:36.700
- So I want to see how he fixes this.
- We want to go on our honeymoon.

24:36.900 --> 24:42.200
As you whine, you can believe that
you should be in court in 20 minutes.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.800
Soon...

24:45.800 --> 24:49.100
Yes, he passed away today
the hospital in st. Barbara.

24:49.400 --> 24:53.300
So we wish you could
arrange it for us? 

24:53.500 --> 24:55.700
Of course, Mrs. Weathertone.

24:56.100 --> 25:02.800
Artesia Boulevard 3700, apartment four.
Up the stairs and in the back?

25:03.200 --> 25:05.000
- Right.
- Good.

25:05.300 --> 25:11.200
- Are you many mourners?
- Yes, we are many family members ...

25:11.600 --> 25:16.800
<i> - so we need a limousine. </i>
- Okay, we'll send one to you.

25:17.200 --> 25:21.300
- Thanks, we appreciate it.
<i> - Thank you. </i>

25:26.200 --> 25:33.000
Just that, outside the lobby
Villa Riviera Hotel Long Beach.

25:33.500 --> 25:39.200
Two o'clock today. Six pieces should go
to the Ana High Convention Center

25:39.600 --> 25:45.400
<i> Hi, I want to order a limousine that can
take five people, half two in the afternoon</i>

25:46.900 --> 25:53.700
<i> We want to go to the airport.
The address is Artesia 8253. </i>

25:54.200 --> 25:56.000
Okay thank you very much.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.000
Hi, I'm calling for Haines and Purcell.

26:00.200 --> 26:05.500
I want a limousine picking up
Mrs Haines at the Tijuana Café in Gardena

26:05.900 --> 26:08.600
Can you be there exactly at 3pm?

26:35.400 --> 26:38.600
- This job sabotages my sex life.
- Who would want to have sex with you?

26:38.800 --> 26:41.400
<i> - No one you know, that's for sure!
- Look at that! </i>

26:41.800 --> 26:44.300
<i> - I think I'm in love!
- I meant the car ... </i>

26:44.600 --> 26:46.500
Ten to one that she forgot the keys

27:03.400 --> 27:06.300
<i> I'm getting tired
on stealing Eleanor</i>

27:06.500 --> 27:10.200
The Venezuelan general is waiting for it

27:10.400 --> 27:13.000
This time she is mine.
Time to say "goodbye".

29:06.400 --> 29:10.100
No, baby. I promise.
We are going to London next week.

29:10.500 --> 29:16.500
I love you too. Bye.
You sabotaged it this time!

29:17.600 --> 29:19.400
What is the matter now?

29:19.600 --> 29:22.600
<i> We've been asked to investigate
Taylor Webb's used cars</i>

29:23.000 --> 29:27.100
You remember the Challenger we fixed,
the previous owner saw it ...

29:27.300 --> 29:30.200
-and recognized the registration number!

29:30.600 --> 29:35.300
How can the scrap car he bought
five days ago to be out again?

29:36.900 --> 29:39.500
- I'll tell you what to do.
- And that is?

29:39.800 --> 29:43.300
Make an inquiry about Taylor Webb
according to the usual procedure.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.300
Before it's done so
everyone has forgotten it.

29:45.600 --> 29:49.400
- Are you serious?
- How can it be in this stupid house!

29:49.800 --> 29:53.400
The pumpkin called and said Jill was sick.

29:53.700 --> 29:57.200
I called Taylor Webb too
Prince Chrysler is open today.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.300
And don't worry.
I let the good fairy take care of it.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.100
It's gone tomorrow!

31:00.800 --> 31:01.800
I'm at Prince Chrysler.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.400
A tow truck is about to attach a car.
I'm investigating it

31:05.700 --> 31:07.100
<I> Roger. </ I>

35:17.600 --> 35:21.400
- You had been looking for me?
- You have a meeting this afternoon ...

35:21.800 --> 35:26.000
- with Parnelli Jones and the insurance company
about Ollie Broncon stolen yesterday.

35:26.300 --> 35:30.700
- You mean Janet. I will take care of it.
- Okay, then we say so.

35:31.100 --> 35:34.000
We have to go, Stash.
I have to investigate a car theft.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.700
Someone has stolen Parnelli Jones Bronco.
I think it was Atlee.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
- I hope he was.
- Look to the right!

35:42.500 --> 35:44.600
- Another Eleanor.
- Then you don't need one ... 

35:44.800 --> 35:45.900
You see them everywhere

35:46.200 --> 35:50.400
She has caused problems for us. But so
she is the last real Mustang.

35:50.700 --> 35:53.600
- Nice color.
- Sure.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.600
He swung into the International Towers.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.300
May be good to know
if we need a new Eleanor.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.300
- Hi, Frank.
- You keep the time.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.700
- You look tired.
- I'm a little nervous and upset

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
- Why?
- On Sunday, J.C's Rolls Royce was stolen.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.500
And yesterday another four were stolen
exclusive cars, insured with us!

36:24.700 --> 36:28.600
We can't find them in 30 days
then we lose $ 150,000!

36:29.000 --> 36:33.100
- J.C's car, did it stand on Ascot?
- Yes. But this is worse.

36:33.500 --> 36:38.600
Yesterday evening stole some Parnelli Jones Bronco,
which we insured for $ 100,000.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.500
It will not be found within 15 days, before
competition, we lose a quarter of a million!

36:45.900 --> 36:49.200
- The odds of it being one in 10,000.
- One of 22,000.

36:49.600 --> 36:54.000
- Then I understand that the company is worried.
- Mr Jones is free.

36:55.200 --> 36:58.600
- Nice to meet you.
- See you later.

37:01.500 --> 37:05.500
Mr. Jones, Frank Kaqeuno from Insurance
Company. We talked at earlier.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.300
- This is Mr. Pace from Chase Research.
- Pleasant.

37:09.700 --> 37:14.600
I've heard that anyone can
find my Bronco, that's you.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.700
- Can you tell us about the theft?
<i> - We think it was pros who did it. </i>

37:20.100 --> 37:22.900
The police couldn't find anything.

37:23.100 --> 37:26.600
Sure it was stolen,
not just lost?

37:27.000 --> 37:29.800
No, I'm sure.

37:30.100 --> 37:35.300
- Is that a picture of the car?
- Yes, it was taken in Mexico, last year.

37:35.600 --> 37:40.100
- Can we see the place where it was stolen?
- Sure, follow me.

37:40.500 --> 37:44.000
They couldn't drive right away
out on the street with it

37:44.200 --> 37:48.000
Yes, it is quite unusual ...
so I want it back.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.600
We'll do what we can, Mr. Parnelli.

37:50.800 --> 37:57.500
- Are they here also insured with you?
- Yes, and ten more for eight million.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.200
<i> - No wonder I'm asleep. </i>
- It's just who you imagine.

38:02.500 --> 38:07.600
- Don't let such little things worry you.
- Here stood Broncon when it disappeared.

38:08.100 --> 38:11.200
- It's definitely not here now.
- Sorry, Jim Cook is on the phone.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.400
- I'll take this down.
- Okay.

38:14.700 --> 38:17.600
Excuse me,
just make sure you find my Bronco

38:17.900 --> 38:21.300
If we can't find it, Frank comes in
and pay $ 350,000.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.100
- I'd rather get the car back.
<i> - We'll do our best. </i>

38:24.400 --> 38:26.800
I'm going to the police
and downloading the report ...

38:27.000 --> 38:28.100
-I'll send it to your office.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.900
Okay, I have to start working.
See you later.

38:46.500 --> 38:52.900
- I'll get Lyle Waggoner's car.
- What? Wait a minute.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.000
- I'll get the car!
- It's not finished.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.100
- I have to go!
- You're not Lyle!

38:58.400 --> 39:02.200
I know, I would just download
his car. I am in a bit of a hurry!

39:02.600 --> 39:05.000
- I haven't been able to grow it!
- This is enough!

39:05.300 --> 39:08.000
I don't get paid
the car is not ready.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.800
- I'm in a hurry!
- Do you have any tablets?

39:10.000 --> 39:10.800
I have to go!

39:17.500 --> 39:20.300
Spaceship in sight! Fire!

39:20.600 --> 39:24.200
- Where did Lyle's car go?
- He came and fetched ...

39:24.600 --> 39:27.500
I saw someone stick with it!
I'll get it!

39:27.700 --> 39:28.700
Where the hell did it go?

39:28.900 --> 39:31.500
- Lyle Waggoner has no beard.
- I'm not Lyle Waggoner!

39:31.800 --> 39:36.000
- I'll get the car! Where is it?
- Do you have any tablets?

39:36.200 --> 39:40.300
Can I ask something?
Have you paid the insurance?

39:40.500 --> 39:41.500
Poppers?

39:44.700 --> 39:46.400
Watch out.

39:51.400 --> 39:55.800
- Good afternoon. Upstairs Gallery.
- Arleen Bates from Stutz's car agency

39:56.100 --> 39:58.400
Did Mr. Syman keep his Stutz?

39:58.600 --> 40:01.700
<i> I'm calling to hear
if he is happy with it</i>

40:02.000 --> 40:06.300
- He is. He drives with it every day.
- Very good, that's what we want to hear

40:06.600 --> 40:09.600
- Thank you very much.
- Fun to be able to help

40:51.800 --> 40:55.900
- We were lucky.
- Pumpkin sent a letter and ...

40:56.300 --> 40:59.900
- explained that we do not own the car!
- We must close the company soon!

41:00.100 --> 41:02.000
Leave me alone!

41:03.600 --> 41:05.500
Nancy is here. Open the door

41:07.000 --> 41:09.300
- Can't you open the door?
- Never ever!

41:09.500 --> 41:11.600
Keep it here!

41:11.900 --> 41:16.300
- What should I do with it?
- Put it in the hedge!

41:23.700 --> 41:26.700
- How do I look in this car?
- Like a pole. Where is the wig?

41:27.000 --> 41:31.400
- It was itching.
- Take the car in and clean it out.

41:33.900 --> 41:35.600
<i> Atlee, open the boot. </i>

41:37.900 --> 41:41.300
Here it was full of rubbish.
Take some garbage bags here.

41:41.500 --> 41:44.500
<i> Make sure you get it done quickly! </i>

41:48.100 --> 41:52.000
- Check the luggage.
- Just toil and tow.

41:56.700 --> 41:58.600
Hell!

42:01.000 --> 42:02.400
Can I see.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.700
- Heroin.
- You're kidding

42:08.900 --> 42:15.500
Can I see. We are rich!
See how much it is!

42:16.000 --> 42:19.100
- What do you think it's worth?
- Surely over a million!

42:19.600 --> 42:22.800
- Can we sell it?
<i> - Everything can be sold. </i>

42:24.500 --> 42:27.900
- Where did you find the car?
- It was outside a game room.

42:28.100 --> 42:30.000
- Leave it back
- What do you mean!

42:30.300 --> 42:33.400
- You heard! Return it!
- I will fix it.

42:37.900 --> 42:39.200
- Who is it?
- Police!

42:39.500 --> 42:41.600
The whole car is full of drugs!

42:53.100 --> 42:54.700
A moment!

43:05.300 --> 43:08.500
- Hawkins, it was just you.
- You work at night too?

43:08.900 --> 43:11.700
- You know how it is.
- I know.

43:16.300 --> 43:20.000
- How is it?
- Come on, guys. Time to work

43:20.400 --> 43:26.800
<i> - What do you want, Hawkins? </i>
- The boss is on, he wants results

43:27.000 --> 43:29.300
- The boss.
- Continue with Pinton!

43:29.700 --> 43:31.100
- What is this?
<i> - A Cadillac. </i>

43:31.400 --> 43:34.500
- What's wrong with that?
- Repair after car theft.

43:34.800 --> 43:37.100
- Handsome.
- Do you like it?

43:37.500 --> 43:42.100
- Why are you out so late?
- I've been to Little C. Motors.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.900
- Someone stole a Manta.
- What is it?

43:45.100 --> 43:48.100
<i> One of 35 stolen luxury cars,
in just three days</i>

43:48.400 --> 43:49.800
<i> Sure you heard it? </i>

43:50.000 --> 43:54.400
The only thing I hear is when insurance
the companies scream when they lose money.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.400
Nice cart.

44:04.800 --> 44:07.700
Can you back away so that
Eugene comes into the office?

44:07.800 --> 44:10.000
- Yes.
- Thanks

44:17.800 --> 44:19.700
It is enough.

44:27.400 --> 44:32.400
I've worked too hard. Make me one
service. Keep your ears open.

44:32.900 --> 44:37.500
Five cars have probably been stolen
while I've been here.

44:37.900 --> 44:40.500
I do not think so. Good night.

44:45.200 --> 44:47.400
Damn what luck we had!

44:50.200 --> 44:55.000
- We sell it all at once!
- We'll talk about it tomorrow.

46:23.800 --> 46:28.300
- We have to return Eleanor.
- Why? The order is complete.

46:28.700 --> 46:34.300
- She's not insured. See for yourself.
- You're joking!

46:34.600 --> 46:40.000
"Desperate owner. Ford Mustang -73
stolen in Gardena. "

46:40.400 --> 46:43.500
"Uninsured. Returned - no questions asked."

46:45.000 --> 46:50.500
I'm tired. I'm not the Superman.
Look, the order is done.

46:52.200 --> 46:55.500
- Where's Eldoradon?
- It's gone.

46:55.800 --> 46:59.300
<i> - What did you do with it? </i>
- I burned it.

46:59.600 --> 47:02.200
Burned a million in heroin?

47:06.700 --> 47:12.300
I'm leaving Eleanor again, that's why I am
know where there is another.

47:17.500 --> 47:22.100
<i> We do the impossible, steal 48 cars,
drive them to the warehouse well in advance</i>

47:22.400 --> 47:23.800
The only car that gives us
headache is Eleanor

47:24.000 --> 47:28.900
- Do we have to leave it again?
- I promised Pumpkin that.

47:29.200 --> 47:32.800
It's a hell of a turn
the one we saw yesterday is still there.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.900
Take it easy and light your cigar,
before you bite it.

51:38.600 --> 51:40.200
Hawkins Police Assistant?

51:45.800 --> 51:50.700
Do you want to catch the car thieves you are chasing?
Monitor International Towers.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.400
Who is it?

51:58.900 --> 52:01.200
I'll fix you!

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I have to stretch my legs.

52:56.200 --> 53:01.700
- When will the release come?
- 15 minutes later we are free.

53:24.600 --> 53:27.900
If I find Eleanor, I will hear from you.
Then you can go.

53:29.900 --> 53:36.000
California.
635 Charles-King-George.

53:48.300 --> 53:52.100
635 Charles-King-George.
The car is not wanted.

53:53.300 --> 53:54.900
Roger.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.800
- Nothing. Do you think it's our guy?
- Surely a salesman. We await.

54:35.200 --> 54:39.300
There you have the salesman.
He certainly forgot about the witch alarm.

54:39.500 --> 54:41.500
Maybe it,
or something is going on.

54:41.800 --> 54:44.400
Make a check, it can be called for.

54:48.800 --> 54:52.900
California, 614 Henry-Sam-Ocean.

55:28.200 --> 55:30.300
I should have read the horoscope this morning!

55:44.500 --> 55:49.700
All units:Baker 11 chases one
yellow Ford Mustang -73. 

55:50.200 --> 55:57.100
<i> Registration Number:614 Henry-Sam-Ocean.
It's heading west! </i>

57:02.500 --> 57:05.300
At the moment it is 17 degrees
hot in Long Beach.

57:05.500 --> 57:10.600

Oh my God! He drove into a lamp post!

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.400
Turn! Now we have him!

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:11.400
All units:The vehicle has collided
with a lamp post

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.000
The car chase is over

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.900
<i> It was wrong, it's not over.
I repeat:It's not over</i>

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:45.800
The vehicle has left the highway
and heading south toward the city

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:57.700
<i> "Firestone 16" announces that

<i> There has been a collision. </i>

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:12.600

An ambulance to 223, Figueroa.

You, Billy.
Why do we always do what you want?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.600
Billy, do you want a joint?

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:23.100
- Do you remember the party yesterday?
- It was cool.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:45.700
- Can't this barge go faster?
- I am high.

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:08.200
My name is Darryl Forrest and I'm here
Mayor, Carson Yamamoto ...

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:13.000
- to add the first stone
the new Carson Police House.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.000
In February -68, Carson became
a new neighborhood ...

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:22.200
and since then it is one of those who
grows fastest in Southern California.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.800
It has a population of 82,000 ...

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.500
and estimated assets of 350
million, and no real estate taxes.

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:35.400
What do citizens think about that?
a new police station is being built?

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:38.500
We think it will
an asset to the city.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:45.100
It gives us and nearby
areas better service.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:50.800
It will be a headquarters for everyone
police units and a good resource for the city!

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:57.100
- Where did the money come from?
- They came from ... The city had ...

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:58.800

<i> Here's something happening.
I'm going to ask the cop here</i>

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:12.400
What is going on?

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:19.000
He's talking on the radio.
Art Pile, what are we seeing?

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:23.900
Units from another city are chasing
a car in our district.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:29.100
It is confirmed that it is a car chase.
We don't really know why.

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:51.700
When I came out of the store it came
a car was dumping down the street.

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:55.200
I was so scared that
I rushed in again ...

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:59.000
- He came on the street and you ...
- On the sidewalk!

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.600
He came from there, hit some trees,
killed 500 people!

01:20:54.700 --> 01:21:01.400
All units:A roadblock has been set up
at the Mazda agency in Torrence

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:02.500
Take it gently

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:27.400
This is the police!
Escape the area!

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:34.400
We have only a few minutes left!
He just passed Western Avenue!

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:38.800
Park the cars in the area and drive
up a roadblock! Hurry up!

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.300
I think I hear them.
Bring out the shotgun.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.400
There is the roadblock!

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:17.400
He turns!
No, the other way around!

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.200
Phone to the service department.

01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:41.200
Phone to ...

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.700
All units:The suspect
is now in Cadillac's premises ... 

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.800
<i> - on Hawthorn Boulevard.
The area is blocked off. Wait. </ I></i>

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:04.600
You are surrounded and cannot escape!

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:26.500
Can I talk to Mr. Bud Waukime?
It's from Moran Cadillac.

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:34.900
Mr. Bud Waukime, phone

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:47.500
- Waukime here.
- I don't know what to say.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:48.800
The place is ruined!

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:55.300
All cars have been damaged for that
the police chased a thief!

01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.500
<i> - Everything went so fast! </i>
- I'll be there right away!

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:05.800
Two rescue teams, one collision
with four cars and many injured

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:11.000
<i> Send the step-car here, we need </i>
The hydraulic shears

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:19.400
The suspect has left
Cadillac and now head west.

01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:24.800
Redondo has reported
about an accident at Splagler

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:29.700
The accident has nothing to do with it
the car chase to do

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:33.200
<i> The area has been blocked off,
except for emergency vehicles</i>

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:37.700
The suspect is heading in that direction.
Take care in the area

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:29.100
Send more ambulances here

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:34.000
<i> We got hurt with any
fractures and internal bleeding</i>

01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:01.200
<i> Possible concussion.
Arrival at the hospital, 12 minutes</i>

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.300
Hello there. I just left Long
Beach and traffic seem to flow poorly.

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:24.400
The roads are lined with ambulances,
police cars and car wrecks.

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:27.400
I destroyed my nice umbrella!

01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:31.100
We have not had the same resurrection
then Queen Mary was visiting.

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:37.700

- Come on, Billy.
- Didn't the shock absorbers give up?

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:37.000
- Something's broken.
- Was it the police?

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:42.200
- Fortunately not!
- They are full on the car chase.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:48.500

- I'm coming.

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:55.200
- Who should we dedicate to the party?
- Eleanor, we have a party for her.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:04.200
Excuse me, is that your car? Can you go to
the office, we have to wash it again.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:09.000
- Wash it again?
- I'll bring it when it's done.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:10.900
It only takes a few minutes.

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:28.100
- You're never Hal Maclaine?
- That's me.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.500
- Constable Hines, Long Beach Police.
- What can I do for you?

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:44.900
Do you own a yellow Mustang -73 with
registration number 614 HSO?

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.300
It sounds like my car.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:52.700
<i> An extra broadcast from KLIS news.
The car chase performed by Long Beach ... </i>

01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:56.500
Soon we will be fined for air pollution.

01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:02.500
- The police won't stop a wreck, like our car.
- We won't go far with it.

01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:05.300
- I hadn't thought to go far.
- Take a joint.

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:09.100
- Do you think the car sticks to the dump?
- I do not know.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.200
I hope so.

01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:34.900
In Long Beach with a car chase,
made by police cars and helicopters

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:39.800

But they are probably washing the car.

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.500
A yellow Mustang.

01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.400
There he is!

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.700
Do not move!

- What is happening?
- Can I look at the driver's license?

01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:36.300
How do I get out on the highway?

01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:03.200
Stop!

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:10.300

- Thanks.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:43.100
- We still stick together.
- Maybe we can sell it in parts.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:48.100
If only we could find it

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.200
See you, Billy.
