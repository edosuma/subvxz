WEBVTT

00:08.541 --> 00:09.667
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:09.709 --> 00:11.540
Oh, man...

00:11.578 --> 00:13.170
Oh, man, he's backing up!

00:13.213 --> 00:15.113
Fly! He's backing up! Come on!

00:15.148 --> 00:17.343
No.
We'll double his pleasure.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.181
Take two, mother muchachos!

00:19.219 --> 00:22.120
- And call us in the morning.
- Yeah, call us. We'll be drunk.

00:22.155 --> 00:24.055
Hey, what's wrong
with your fingers?

00:24.090 --> 00:26.024
They seem to be
all up in my grill...

00:26.059 --> 00:30.496
when they would be better placed
crammed up your buttocks.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.656
Biznatch.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.858
You should say that to his face.

00:32.899 --> 00:35.663
I did, just as soon as
I flipped them off...

00:35.702 --> 00:38.262
with... I... I can't flip the...

00:38.304 --> 00:40.795
You flip them off
with your fingers, Emory.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.775
Uh, I... I can't get it
to do right.

00:43.810 --> 00:44.936
Well, then show him...

00:44.978 --> 00:48.209
the dark sides
of the plutonium moons.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.341
Hey, kiss this one.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.544
What the...
Dude, they're mooning us.

00:52.585 --> 00:54.576
Impossible.
We are the Mooninites.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.715
- Engage moon deflectors.
- Commence remooning at once.

00:57.757 --> 00:59.987
- Remooning commence...
- Err, please.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.051
Your buttocks
are so small and square...

01:02.095 --> 01:03.926
it barely reads as a moon.

01:03.963 --> 01:06.488
Then it's time for full frontal!

01:06.533 --> 01:08.467
Open the fly to your sunshine.

01:08.501 --> 01:09.866
Yeah, put 'em on the glass.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.532
<i>My name is Shake Zula</i>

01:13.573 --> 01:15.803
<i>The mike ruler,
the old-schooler</i>

01:15.842 --> 01:17.742
<i>You want to trip,
I'll bring it to ya</i>

01:17.777 --> 01:21.076
<i>Frylock and I'm on top,
rock you like a cop</i>

01:21.114 --> 01:23.912
<i>Meatwad, you're up next
with your knock-knock</i>

01:23.950 --> 01:26.111
<i>Meatwad make the money, see</i>

01:26.152 --> 01:28.586
<i>Meatwad get the honeys, G</i>

01:28.621 --> 01:31.556
<i>Drivin' in my car,

01:31.591 --> 01:34.526
<i>Ice on my fingers and my toes

01:34.561 --> 01:37.086
<i>Uh, check-check it, yeah</i>

01:37.130 --> 01:39.462
<i>'Cause we are the Aqua Teens</i>

01:39.499 --> 01:42.798

01:42.836 --> 01:44.667
<i>'Cause we are the Aqua Teens</i>

01:44.704 --> 01:48.162
<i>Make the homeys say ho

01:48.208 --> 01:50.369
<i>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</i>

01:50.410 --> 01:52.810
<i>Number one in the 'hood, G</i>

01:52.846 --> 01:54.746
So the real question is...

01:54.781 --> 01:57.215
how do we improve
computer chip technology...

01:57.250 --> 01:59.878
faced with microscopic
size limitations?

01:59.919 --> 02:02.080
And I know we've all
asked ourselves that...

02:02.122 --> 02:03.919
at one time or another, right?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.288
Oh.

02:05.325 --> 02:06.792
Shake?

02:06.826 --> 02:07.815
Meatwad?

02:09.696 --> 02:10.822
- Hey!
- Uhh!

02:10.864 --> 02:12.695
- Shrink ray.
- You got a shrink ray?

02:12.732 --> 02:14.165
We had to go through
all that crap...

02:14.200 --> 02:16.498
just so you could show us
the shrink ray?

02:16.536 --> 02:18.231
Now what you're saying
is interesting.

02:18.271 --> 02:19.397
- All right, shrink this.
- Whoa!

02:19.439 --> 02:20.531
- The chair!
- Now shrink this.

02:20.573 --> 02:21.562
- Wait a minute.
- Shrink this.

02:21.608 --> 02:23.599
- No, not that one.
- Then shrink this.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.634
- Make it a big-screen.
- Meatwad...

02:25.678 --> 02:27.305
it's not a toy, Shake.

02:27.347 --> 02:29.338
You say that
about everything you own.

02:29.382 --> 02:31.850
You should own toys.
They're fun.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.614
Shake, this is
an important scientific tool.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.281
I mean,
surgery, space exploration.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.983
Can't you just see
the applications?

02:38.024 --> 02:40.549
Yes. Make my johnson bigger!

02:40.593 --> 02:41.855
And make this a foot-long.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.386
Hey... and shoot us a pool
in the back.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.193
The ray does not shoot pools.

02:46.232 --> 02:47.699
Then why are you
wasting your time on it?

02:47.734 --> 02:49.827
You oughta invent, like,
a pool-shooting ray.

02:49.869 --> 02:51.393
- Swimming.
- Doing the high dive.

02:51.437 --> 02:52.699
Marco Polo!

02:52.739 --> 02:55.207
I mean, can't you see
the applications?

02:55.241 --> 02:56.833
Give me some relish.
And mustard, too.

02:56.876 --> 02:57.934
I want me a yellow dog.

02:57.977 --> 02:59.740
No. We're doing
my johnson first...

02:59.779 --> 03:02.179
and let me find some chicks
and upgrade their butts...

03:02.215 --> 03:04.046
'cause baby likes back.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.414
<i>My anaconda
don't want none...</i>

03:05.451 --> 03:07.476
All right, everyone,
just stand back...

03:07.520 --> 03:09.545
and prepare to make history.

03:11.624 --> 03:12.989
Amazing.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.618
Do you realize
that now this chip...

03:14.661 --> 03:16.288
can be inserted
into a microbot...

03:16.329 --> 03:17.990
that could enter
into someone's skin...

03:18.031 --> 03:21.057
Or it can be inserted
into the mouth, manually...

03:21.100 --> 03:24.729
and digested, so it can
battle hunger and taste good.

03:24.771 --> 03:25.965
Ooh!

03:26.005 --> 03:28.303
Tell me you didn't just eat
that freakin'...

03:28.341 --> 03:31.504
Oh, boy, you said it was a chip,
so where's the dip?

03:31.544 --> 03:33.569
Or am I looking at him?

03:33.613 --> 03:37.845
Ooh, you did not even
just do that!

03:37.884 --> 03:42.651
You are so dead.
Oh, no, you didn't!

03:42.689 --> 03:43.951
Oh, my God!

03:48.027 --> 03:49.551
All right. Here you go.
Drink this.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.564
- I'm not thirsty.
- I said drink it.

03:51.598 --> 03:52.758
Well, what is it?

03:52.799 --> 03:53.925
It's mustard, vinegar,
and oyster sauce.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.764
Oyster sauce? All right.

03:55.802 --> 03:56.928
Because, you see, that chip?

03:56.970 --> 03:58.403
It's coming out of you
one way or another.

03:58.438 --> 03:59.837
A little tart,
but you could fix that...

03:59.872 --> 04:01.430
with a little half-and-half.

04:01.474 --> 04:04.238
But it was good.
So give me another.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.768
I get it now.
He bad-mouths you...

04:06.813 --> 04:09.338
and you make him delicious
sugary energy shakes...

04:09.382 --> 04:12.317
and I open my mouth,
in a helpful way...

04:12.352 --> 04:13.751
and I get slapped.

04:13.786 --> 04:15.083
Must be in topsy-turvy world.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.589
Here's another,
and I may have peed in this one.

04:17.624 --> 04:18.648
- No way.
- Shake, wait...

04:18.690 --> 04:19.885
I'm in training.

04:21.793 --> 04:22.886
Kinda fruity when you...

04:24.000 --> 04:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:35.842 --> 04:39.209
Yeah, that was good.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.770
My teeth feel gritty...

04:41.814 --> 04:43.372
and I'm going to lie down.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.384
Well, not bad.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.079
Scrape me some of that
in a glass.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.485
A body needs nutrients.

04:48.521 --> 04:51.957
And I need that chip, Meatwad,
one way or the other.

04:51.991 --> 04:53.515
Oh, OK. Yeah.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.424
Fecal matter. Stool sample.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.792
Don't talk about it. Just do it.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.922
Heh heh. Well, I don't do it.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.661
My body consumes
all waste material.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.532
It's like the Thunderdome
in here.

05:03.569 --> 05:06.732
Only two men enter.
No man leaves.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.400
- Rated "R."
- No.

05:08.441 --> 05:11.001
Starring Mel Gibson
and Master Blaster.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.136
Are you serious?

05:12.178 --> 05:14.169
- Yup.
- You don't...

05:14.213 --> 05:15.407
Don't what?

05:15.448 --> 05:17.075
- Uh...
- Come on.

05:17.116 --> 05:18.845
You... you know.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.080
Look, we're adults in here.
You can say it.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.747
Uh, poop?

05:22.789 --> 05:24.222
You said "poop"!

05:24.257 --> 05:27.055
Hey, Shake,
Frylock said "poop" in here!

05:27.093 --> 05:28.287
Poop!

05:31.464 --> 05:33.091
Ha ha ha ha! Poop.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.656
Look, here's a solution.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.328
You want your chip
so damn bad...

05:36.369 --> 05:38.166
shrink yourself down
with your gun...

05:38.204 --> 05:39.762
come in here, and get it.

05:39.806 --> 05:42.138
Oh, well, that's, heh heh,
that's cute, Meatwad...

05:42.175 --> 05:44.575
but, uh, that would never work.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.942
OK, Shake. Shrink me down...

05:46.979 --> 05:49.004
and inject me into Meatwad
so I can get that chip.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.448
Good plan. How is that different
from what I said?

05:51.484 --> 05:53.315
- Because I said "inject. "
- OK, which is the button?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.412
It's the red one.
It's the only one on there.

05:55.455 --> 05:56.479
- This one?
- Shake.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.648
- Hey, bitch!
- Confirm for me.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.555
- Hey, boy!
- Is this the button?

05:59.592 --> 06:00.650
- Yes! Stop!
- Stop!

06:00.693 --> 06:02.661
- Was that the one?
- Yes. Now stop shrinking him.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.356
Otherwise, I can't get in there.

06:04.397 --> 06:06.422
All right, crybaby.
Tears can dry.

06:06.466 --> 06:07.694
But that was the button.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.531
- Yes. Stop it, will you?
- Aah!

06:09.569 --> 06:12.003
So are we gonna go through
this masquerade all day...

06:12.038 --> 06:15.474
or, uh, are we gonna
get down to business?

06:15.508 --> 06:16.634
Look, I'm ready.

06:18.644 --> 06:21.044
OK, now, put me in the syringe.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.048
Say that again.
That was awesome.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.414
Come on. I'm tired of messing
around. Put me in there!

06:25.451 --> 06:27.419
I wish you could hear
how you sound.

06:27.453 --> 06:29.546
It's hysterical. Ha ha ha.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.648
Hey! Hey, get back here.
Where the hell are you going?

06:31.691 --> 06:34.626
Hey, I go where I want to,
little man.

06:34.660 --> 06:38.152
Man, I don't understand
a damn thing y'all are doing.

06:40.833 --> 06:44.735
Quick, grab a weapon
and battle for the mountain!

06:44.771 --> 06:47.706
- Damn it, Shake.
- You will call me king, slave.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.833
Now fight for my amusement!

06:49.876 --> 06:52.174
- Ow!
- How'd you like that tune-up?

06:52.211 --> 06:53.473
Carl, what are you doing?

06:53.513 --> 06:56.346
Stay down. He said if I won,
he'd make my johnson bigger.

06:56.382 --> 06:58.509
I mean, it's all right...
but, uh, you know...

06:58.551 --> 07:01.679
never hurts to get extra credit,
you know what I mean?

07:01.721 --> 07:03.746
OK, OK, OK, Fry man. I get it.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.553
He just sort of played with
my insecurities.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.354
Come on, Fry man.
I'd never hurt you.

07:07.393 --> 07:10.988
Oh, no!
Beware of the hairy giant!

07:11.030 --> 07:12.861
Look I'm sorry about this,
Fry man...

07:12.899 --> 07:14.560
- but it's you or me.
- Aah!

07:14.600 --> 07:16.192
And I keep getting
these freakin' e-mails.

07:16.235 --> 07:19.204
These people... I know
that I'm small down there!

07:19.238 --> 07:20.637
Carl, will you listen to me?

07:20.673 --> 07:23.540
Yeah, listen to him.
Isn't it funny how he talks?

07:23.576 --> 07:25.737
Hey, hang on.
I'm gonna make it even funnier.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.370
Hold on a minute.

07:27.413 --> 07:30.678
If we work together,
we can defeat him.

07:30.716 --> 07:33.048
All right, we'll work a deal,
but you gotta promise me.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.245
You got to get me
some action down here...

07:34.287 --> 07:35.686
when we're done with this.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.985
I mean, I'm freakin, you know,
hung like a zoo animal...

07:38.024 --> 07:39.491
but I want more girth.

07:39.525 --> 07:42.983
Oh, no!
A hailstorm of orange drink!

07:43.029 --> 07:46.795
Aww, come on, man!
Fry man, shoot this jackass.

07:46.833 --> 07:49.165
That's it.
You just made your last mistake.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.430
Try this on for size.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.902
Aww, that's so cute.
You want to compare rays. OK.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.011
OK, so, uh, hey.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.844
Heh heh. I won, right?

08:02.882 --> 08:05.112
So, are you gonna hook me up
here, or what?

08:05.151 --> 08:07.711
You know, I need, uh,
length and girth.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.983
Both, preferably.
I'll take one. Whatever.

08:10.022 --> 08:14.322
One more contender
in the battle for the mountain!

08:14.360 --> 08:16.487
Oh, freakin' take it.
It's right over there.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.494
Wake up, Shake. Shake.

08:21.534 --> 08:23.525
- Wake up.
- Let me do it.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.230
Get up, you freakin' jerkoff.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.432
- Where are you?
- We're all up in your brain.

08:27.473 --> 08:30.874
No, that's impossible.
I have no brain.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.003
Yeah, we noticed. So I just
had to short-circuit...

08:33.044 --> 08:34.376
some nerves in here.

08:34.413 --> 08:35.607
We control you now.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.410
- Oh, bull crap.
- Hey, buddy!

08:37.450 --> 08:39.884
You're about to see
what I think is funny.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.886
Hey, pick up the baseball bat.

08:41.921 --> 08:43.717
No, no, no, no. No!

08:43.756 --> 08:45.656
Why am I doing this?
I'm dreaming!

08:45.691 --> 08:47.283
Well, let's just wake you up,
there, all right?

08:47.326 --> 08:48.759
Rise and shine, buddy!

08:48.794 --> 08:53.993
Yo, I'm doing this 'cause
I want to do it all the time...

08:54.033 --> 08:56.763
when you're not around.
Aww.

08:56.802 --> 08:58.793
All gone. Start up the chainsaw.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.465
OK, wait. We can discuss this.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.701
I don't think so, sir,
without your tongue.

09:02.742 --> 09:05.040
Aah!

09:05.077 --> 09:06.977
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.243
Meatwad... I'll increase you
with the ray...

09:09.282 --> 09:10.977
- then you do us, OK?
- OK.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.111
Hit me.

09:16.822 --> 09:17.948
Keep it coming.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.084
Need a little more.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.525
No, this is small.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.960
Little more. Little more.
Keep it coming.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.227
All right, whoa.

09:28.267 --> 09:31.668
There we go.
Gimme another little bump.

09:31.704 --> 09:32.898
That's big enough. Now do us.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.201
Hey, y'all see
this big old hot dog?

09:34.240 --> 09:36.765
- Meatwad?
- Damn, that's a big hot dog.

09:36.809 --> 09:37.833
- Meatwad!
- Hey!

09:37.877 --> 09:39.242
- Meatwad!
- Hey, get back here!

09:41.847 --> 09:44.042
Meatwad.
Wake up, Meatwad. Wake up.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.516
Who's in there?

09:45.551 --> 09:47.610
Are you in my brain?
Get out of my brain!

09:47.653 --> 09:48.711
No, we're right here.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.518
Oh, good. Hey, you want you
some hot dog?

09:51.557 --> 09:53.149
We... we got plenty.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.558
Look at this. Solid meat.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.926
Hello, ladies.

09:56.963 --> 10:00.455
I'd like you to meet
my little friend Goliath.

10:00.499 --> 10:05.232
We had to order special elastic
pants for him on the internet.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.795
In case you're wondering...

10:06.839 --> 10:08.932
we had to blow out one of
Shake's eyeballs to get out...

10:08.975 --> 10:11.409
but we're OK now,
no thanks to you.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.934
Where's Carl?

10:12.979 --> 10:15.004
Oh, yeah! Awesome!

10:15.047 --> 10:17.743
He's, uh, enhancing himself.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.512
Is he learning
a second language?

10:19.552 --> 10:21.417
Hey, you guys got
a wheelbarrow in here...

10:21.454 --> 10:23.786
or, uh, you know,
grocery cart or something?

10:23.823 --> 10:24.949
No, Carl, we don't.

10:24.991 --> 10:27.221
- Anything with wheels.
- No, Carl.

10:27.259 --> 10:28.317
What, you're telling me
I got to...

10:28.361 --> 10:30.761
drag this frickin' thing
across the lawn?

10:30.796 --> 10:33.390
Call the neighbors.
I want them to see this.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.763
- Oh, damn!
- Oh, my God.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.203
Hey, um, I told you
I'd find that chip.

10:40.239 --> 10:43.174
Oh, this frickin' ray
is frickin' awesome.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.767
Hey, you think this works
on boobs?

10:44.810 --> 10:47.836
Yeah, it probably would,
but it must be destroyed.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.370
Oh, OK, Mr. Moral.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.883
Look, don't do that. I'll
buy it from you. Come on, man.

10:52.918 --> 10:55.546
Oh, man, you blew it, dude.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.818
I'd have given you,
like, fifteen bucks.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.825
You're stupid for a genius.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.121
What the... what the hell is that?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.094
Look, Frylock, crabs.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.892
Can we keep 'em?

11:04.930 --> 11:06.022
Boy, there's a lot of those.

11:06.065 --> 11:07.930
Well, look,
they're harmless, all right?

11:07.967 --> 11:10.333
They get near you,
hit 'em with the shampoo.

11:10.369 --> 11:11.563
