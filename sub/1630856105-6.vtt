WEBVTT

00:15.015 --> 00:16.766
Oh no! I’m gonna be late!

00:16.766 --> 00:19.853
I can’t fail out of high school
right after getting there!

00:20.353 --> 00:21.771
Waaaa!

00:22.772 --> 00:24.441
Owww...

00:25.859 --> 00:26.776
You all right?

00:29.904 --> 00:31.448
Thanks...

00:32.323 --> 00:33.324
I'm so sorry.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.452
I'm really in quite a rush--

00:36.036 --> 00:37.787
Your way of running is quite improper.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.956
I nearly thought a hippo hit me.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.500
Be careful, or you might run someone over.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.716
<i>Baka!</i>

00:57.515 --> 00:58.558
You're go for Goose.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.562
I'm looking for Graves, Gideon.
Who the hell is Goose?

01:03.271 --> 01:06.399
You've reached the adult
formerly known as Gideon Graves.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.943
It's the Goose now. Gordon Goose.

01:09.903 --> 01:10.987
That's cool.

01:10.987 --> 01:13.865
You know, my name isn't Lucas, actually.

01:14.657 --> 01:15.784
It's Luke.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.286
That's not even remotely the same thing.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.205
Never mind.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.248
What can I do you for?

01:22.957 --> 01:25.043
<i>Well, here's how I see it, Goose.</i>

01:25.043 --> 01:27.462
<i>I've lost everything.
You've lost everything.</i>

01:28.046 --> 01:30.381
<i>I thought maybe
you'd have some words of advice.</i>

01:31.466 --> 01:32.967
Now you want something from me.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.178
<i>I know I left you
in the lurch after Matthew,</i>

01:35.178 --> 01:37.680
<i>but if you could
find it in your heart to forgive me, I--</i>

01:37.680 --> 01:39.682
Forgiveness is what you want?

01:42.060 --> 01:45.855
Well, I have something
entirely different in mind.

01:55.698 --> 01:56.991
Friendship!

02:15.093 --> 02:15.927
Ow!

02:39.242 --> 02:40.326
Okay, ready?

02:50.044 --> 02:50.879
Yeah!

03:04.809 --> 03:05.810
You go first.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.188
Whoa! That's awesome!

03:11.566 --> 03:12.650
Wow!

03:20.491 --> 03:22.577
I'm okay. Luke, I'm okay.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.253
You're right, you know.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.088
I'm a real <i>baka</i> boy sometimes...

03:36.216 --> 03:37.258
<i>Why...</i>

03:41.679 --> 03:43.473
Do they even like each other?

03:43.473 --> 03:46.100
Because sometimes it feels like
they hate each other.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.477
This is season 12.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.021
I can loan you the DVDs
if you want the backstory.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.193
I...

03:57.195 --> 04:00.365
I was gone for 90 f****** minutes!

04:02.575 --> 04:04.535
What did you do to my house?

04:04.535 --> 04:06.371
And what's with the robot?

04:06.371 --> 04:07.497
What robot?

06:32.975 --> 06:35.770
- It's you.
- Julie, I'll make this brief.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.522
Is that the sound of skates I hear?

06:37.522 --> 06:41.150
Tell Ramona to come in here and kick it.
We'll watch TV and eat chips.

06:41.150 --> 06:44.904
Oh no! We're out of chips!
Jules, we need chips!

06:46.489 --> 06:49.033
So it's you and Gideon now.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.869
Me and Gideon? No.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.622
That's Gordon. Gordon Goose.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.667
You're saying the guy eating chips
on your couch is not the former

06:57.667 --> 07:00.670
all-powerful evil gazillionaire
I used to date?

07:02.255 --> 07:04.048
This info dump was inevitable.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.430
Be back in a bit, baby!

07:10.430 --> 07:11.389
Okay, bye.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.849
I'll miss you!

07:12.849 --> 07:14.851
I'll miss you f****** more!

07:14.851 --> 07:18.438
<i>Doo doo doo-doo doo, doo doo</i>

07:18.438 --> 07:21.232
<i>Doo doo doo-doo doo</i>

07:21.232 --> 07:23.443
<i>Bread makes you think</i>

07:24.318 --> 07:25.445
Does it?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.863
Doesn't everything?

07:26.863 --> 07:28.030
Too vague.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.908
<i>Bread makes you full</i>

07:31.784 --> 07:33.536
Too obvious.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.456
<i>Doo doo doo-doo-doo</i>

07:36.456 --> 07:38.541
<i>Bread ain't all that</i>

07:38.541 --> 07:40.751
<i>Bread makes you fat</i>

07:44.005 --> 07:45.173
Holy crap!

07:46.174 --> 07:48.718
Hey, Knives,
when did you start playing piano?

07:48.718 --> 07:50.928
More or less than four hours ago?

07:50.928 --> 07:51.929
Slightly more.

07:51.929 --> 07:56.517
And how did you get the CEO of G-Man Media
to bankroll your project?

07:56.517 --> 07:59.687
Oh, well, that was my idea.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.481
Mr. Patel had the capital,

08:01.481 --> 08:04.734
but he was also
an aspiring Broadway theater obsessive.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.487
I read an interview with him
in <i>Forbes.</i> So...

08:07.487 --> 08:12.116
<i>when he flew us to New York City
for a pitch meeting in his secret lair,</i>

08:12.116 --> 08:13.326
<i>I knew exactly what to say.</i>

08:19.999 --> 08:21.876
An off-Broadway musical.

08:21.876 --> 08:25.213
And who better to play the lead than you?

08:26.464 --> 08:28.633
Me? The main character?

08:30.301 --> 08:34.138
Not a lot of people know this,
but I majored in theater in college.

08:34.138 --> 08:37.433
In fact, I briefly starred
in my own one-man show.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.434
Gasp!

08:39.018 --> 08:40.186
I had no clue.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.938
Did anyone get it on video?

08:51.697 --> 08:54.283
<i>Agony, misery, woe!</i>

08:54.283 --> 08:57.453
<i>Though it's different for each</i>

08:57.453 --> 09:01.624
<i>Always ten steps behind
Always ten feet below</i>

09:01.624 --> 09:04.585
<i>And she's just out of reach</i>

09:05.169 --> 09:07.421
<i>Agony--</i>

09:08.464 --> 09:11.008
Wow, impressive!

09:11.008 --> 09:13.219
You think he's got the chops, Stephen?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.139
And then some!

09:17.139 --> 09:20.518
Silence! I've made my decision.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.230
<i>Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Musical...</i>

09:25.856 --> 09:27.984
is a go project!

09:28.651 --> 09:31.487
I hope you know
how much we value your opinion, pal.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.364
We're adapting your work, after all.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.825
From one creative to another,

09:35.825 --> 09:39.912
just know we're making every effort
to treat the material with respect.

09:39.912 --> 09:44.125
I know you're bummed your movie is dead,
but this is fun too, right?

09:44.750 --> 09:47.169
I don't care about
the movie shutting down.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.046
It didn't mean anything to me.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.799
I mean, I miss having my own golf cart.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.051
It didn't mean anything to you?

09:54.051 --> 09:57.888
From one creative to another,
I can't believe you're saying this.

09:57.888 --> 10:01.434
All my songs are like children to me.

10:01.434 --> 10:06.147
I guess the thing about that is
I don't even remember writing it.

10:08.065 --> 10:10.651
Do you mind explaining that
in any way, shape, or form?

10:10.651 --> 10:14.739
Well, I dreamed I saw
my sleep paralysis demon at my computer.

10:14.739 --> 10:18.034
Then I woke up the next day,
and there it was.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.077
A completed script with my name on it.

10:23.205 --> 10:27.335
And you're sure it was
a sleep paralysis demon?

10:27.335 --> 10:28.836
What else would it be?

10:28.836 --> 10:32.214
The person who actually wrote your script?

10:33.883 --> 10:34.717
Oh!

10:38.346 --> 10:39.180
Look!

10:40.681 --> 10:42.808
We have to tell Ramona about this.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.353
Oh, is she involved?

10:45.353 --> 10:48.522
She's the one who's been searching
for Scott this whole time.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.899
Really?

10:49.899 --> 10:51.567
You two moved on with your lives.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.487
But she's been skating all over town
asking a lot of stupid people

10:54.487 --> 10:56.489
some really smart questions.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.449
I didn't know that.

10:59.116 --> 11:03.079
Come on, Knives.
Can't we just let bygones be bygones?

11:03.079 --> 11:06.374
When we saw Ramona on the movie set,
you were as cool as a cucumber.

11:06.957 --> 11:12.463
That was business.
This is emotional business.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.467
<i>Emotional business</i>

11:16.467 --> 11:19.637
<i>Can I get a witness?</i>

11:19.637 --> 11:20.638
Stop!

11:20.638 --> 11:23.766
Enough with the songwriting.
Can we focus for a second?

11:23.766 --> 11:26.268
Right. Let's go see Ramona.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.447
Gideon and Julie?

11:38.447 --> 11:40.533
Please! Gordon Goose would never.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.036
Can you please explain
this "Gordon Goose" thing?

11:45.621 --> 11:50.000
Well, when I was in high school
in North Bay, Ontario,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.212
<i>Gordon Goose was
the weirdest kid in my year.</i>

11:55.047 --> 11:58.843
<i>His glasses were too big for his face.
His clothes fit funny.</i>

11:58.843 --> 12:00.636
<i>Even his hair looked wrong.</i>

12:00.636 --> 12:02.096
<i>Everyone called him "Fearless"</i>

12:02.096 --> 12:04.932
<i>because he wore those
"No Fear" t-shirts every day.</i>

12:04.932 --> 12:08.269
<i>I guess he started taking that name
a little too seriously.</i>

12:08.269 --> 12:11.147
<i>One day, out of nowhere, he presents
the most popular girl in school</i>

12:11.147 --> 12:14.734
<i>with a 12-point business plan
as to why she should date him.</i>

12:14.734 --> 12:16.152
They call me Fearless.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.195
I have no fear of the sting of rejection.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.906
Therefore, there's no downside
to me attempting this.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.422
<i>The whole school was watching.</i>

12:40.259 --> 12:42.136
<i>He moved away after that.</i>

12:42.136 --> 12:43.971
<i>But I never forgot about him.</i>

12:45.598 --> 12:49.518
I had no idea Gideon Graves
was the dorky kid from my past

12:49.518 --> 12:51.395
until he turned up on my doorstep.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.942
<i>Matthew Patel took everything he had.</i>

12:56.942 --> 12:58.152
<i>And what was left behind?</i>

12:58.819 --> 13:00.362
<i>Gordon Goose.</i>

13:03.407 --> 13:05.367
Gordon Goose.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.495
And that's working for you?

13:08.412 --> 13:09.747
We understand each other.

13:10.539 --> 13:15.002
When I was with him, Gideon...
Gordon was a twitchy, rage-filled,

13:15.002 --> 13:19.340
impulsive, emotionally abusive,
controlling, manipulative egomaniac.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.719
But if he makes you happy,
that's good, I guess.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.472
It's not good. It f****** sucks.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.724
I'm sorry, what?

13:28.724 --> 13:31.060
When Gordon showed up,
he was power-hungry.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.603
He wanted revenge.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.855
He would have done anything
to get his empire back.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.066
Ambition is hot.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.736
But after a few days,
it's like the evil drained out.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.614
Now he just sits on the couch
watching anime all day.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.157
What if it's an act?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.284
The Gideon I knew was a plotter.

13:47.284 --> 13:50.162
The whole League of Evil Exes thing
could have been a smokescreen

13:50.162 --> 13:52.373
for an ultra-secret kidnapping plot.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.376
Maybe none of the other exes
were in on it.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.378
Maybe it was all G-Man.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.966
Or maybe the two of you
were in on it together.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.135
Look, I wish that was the case.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.888
I wish we were up to
some exciting villain business.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.932
It would spice things up around the house.

14:10.432 --> 14:13.561
But he's just a loser, trust me.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.897
You can take him, or us, off your list.

14:21.318 --> 14:24.238
One step forward, two steps back.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.616
You should come over and say hey.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.995
I think Gordon wants to apologize
for creating the league and all that.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.038
Do I have to?

14:34.832 --> 14:38.752
Hey. So his real name is Gordon Goose,
and he's living here in the neighborhood,

14:38.752 --> 14:41.171
and he's dating some girl
who works in a coffee shop.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.256
Can you believe that crap?

14:42.256 --> 14:44.884
I love that crap.
I'm obsessed with that crap.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.052
Stacey! Were you eavesdropping?

14:47.052 --> 14:49.054
You shouldn't be here on your day off.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.098
Scoot. Scoot on out of here.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.897
Is that a hole in my roof?

14:59.690 --> 15:02.860
I was gone for 90 f****** minutes!

15:02.860 --> 15:05.237
What did you do to my house?

15:05.237 --> 15:07.072
And what's with the robot?

15:07.072 --> 15:08.490
What robot?

15:15.331 --> 15:17.416
Where have I seen that robot?

15:17.416 --> 15:19.126
I want some answers!

15:19.710 --> 15:22.463
It wasn't me. It was the Goose.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.340
What? Goose don't skate.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.676
Why would I build a skate ramp
in the middle of Julie's lovely home?

15:27.676 --> 15:30.554
She seems pissed.
Does this mean I can't live here?

15:30.554 --> 15:32.431
Live here? What?

15:33.432 --> 15:36.685
I don't care which one of you did it!
You're both gonna pay!

15:36.685 --> 15:38.562
- Gulp.
- Oh no.

15:38.562 --> 15:42.566
<i>Julie Powers versus
Lucas Lee and Gordon Goose.</i>

15:42.566 --> 15:43.817
<i>Fight.</i>

15:47.446 --> 15:49.907
Stop! This is stupid.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.994
Let's all be adults for once, okay?

15:53.994 --> 15:55.955
Julie, what are you doing?

15:55.955 --> 15:58.958
I don't know.
I guess I got caught up in the moment.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.878
Lucas, you can't live here.
That's ridiculous.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.463
Find your own place.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.547
I'm flat broke.

16:05.547 --> 16:08.509
I can't even afford
a first-class flight back to L.A.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.720
And the only work I can get
is voicing an animated series.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.931
Lucas Lee is live action or nothing.

16:13.931 --> 16:17.059
You might need to open your mind
to other opportunities.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.185
And you!

16:18.185 --> 16:19.645
Stop being a loser.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.272
And treat Julie
better than you treated me.

16:26.318 --> 16:29.905
Hey, that robot
with the lampshade on its head.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.740
Where have I seen it before?

16:31.740 --> 16:34.785
During the movie shoot.
He was spying on me in my trailer.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.830
Not there. Somewhere else.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.248
You know who made him, right?

16:39.248 --> 16:41.750
That's their special little guy
right there.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.043
The Twins.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.547
I gotta go.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.437
Guess she's got better things to do.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.480
Well, it's been real.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.399
Yeah, come by the coffee shop sometime.

17:05.399 --> 17:06.316
Free coffee?

17:06.316 --> 17:07.860
No f****** way!

17:07.860 --> 17:10.487
But if you ever want a job, we're hiring.

17:11.697 --> 17:12.573
Whatever.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.491
Gordon...

17:15.576 --> 17:16.869
My man.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.881
Jules, do you think I'm a loser?

17:29.506 --> 17:32.092
I don't know, Gordon.
Sometimes, I guess.

17:32.801 --> 17:33.677
Well,

17:34.178 --> 17:37.556
what if I said that while it seemed
like I wasn't doing anything

17:37.556 --> 17:39.141
and was throwing a pity party...

17:41.185 --> 17:43.687
I was actually planning an elaborate plan.

17:43.687 --> 17:47.608
A plan in which I would get revenge
on the one who took everything from me.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.569
A plan that would turn
Matthew Patel into dust.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.989
What would you say
if I was planning a plan like that?

17:55.449 --> 17:56.909
What would I say?

17:56.909 --> 17:59.745
I'd say, "That's hot."

18:07.836 --> 18:09.713
Now clean my f****** house, Gordon!

18:09.713 --> 18:10.672
Right away!

18:18.514 --> 18:20.224
What are you all doing here?

18:20.224 --> 18:24.269
We have information about your case,
your Scott case.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.063
None of us had your phone number.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.027
What if I told you
I cracked the case wide open?

18:32.027 --> 18:34.530
Would any of you want to hear
what I figured out?

18:42.454 --> 18:45.040
This is my favorite part
of every "whodidit."

18:45.040 --> 18:46.959
The part when you find out who did it.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.210
It's "whodunnit."

18:48.210 --> 18:52.631
If anything, it'd be "Who's done it?"
I would know. I used to be a writer.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.135
Okay.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.971
As you all know, Scott was taken
from the scene of The Rockit

18:58.971 --> 19:00.889
by someone who faked his death.

19:01.723 --> 19:07.187
I've been trying to figure out who did it,
why they did it, and how they did it.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.606
And now I know all three.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.987
Let's start with "the who."

19:15.571 --> 19:17.990
By now, most of you know about my past.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.868
I've dated a lot of people
who were suspect...

19:20.868 --> 19:23.203
That's a similar word to "suspects."

19:23.203 --> 19:24.246
Wow!

19:25.873 --> 19:27.499
Yeah. Wow!

19:27.499 --> 19:30.210
<i>Five exes have been eliminated
from the list.</i>

19:30.210 --> 19:35.090
<i>Matthew Patel, Roxie Richter, Lucas Lee,
Todd Ingram, and Gideon Graves.</i>

19:36.008 --> 19:37.801
Gordon Goose. Not that it matters.

19:37.801 --> 19:42.723
Okay, so, seven exes, five eliminated.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.516
That leaves--

19:44.516 --> 19:46.518
Two. The Twins.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.979
<i>Ken and Kyle Katayanagi.</i>

19:48.979 --> 19:51.773
<i>They were my TAs in Robotics 101.</i>

19:51.773 --> 19:54.776
<i>Ken is 30 seconds older.
Kyle's the hothead.</i>

19:55.569 --> 19:58.488
<i>And that leads to "the why."</i>

19:58.488 --> 20:00.073
<i>They have the motivation.</i>

20:03.368 --> 20:06.997
<i>It was my second semester of college.
I didn't know what I was doing.</i>

20:06.997 --> 20:08.081
<i>I was a kid.</i>

20:08.832 --> 20:11.376
<i>But to the Twins, I was fresh meat.</i>

20:11.877 --> 20:12.753
<i>This year's girl.</i>

20:13.712 --> 20:16.632
<i>They were a couple of players,
and they wouldn't leave me alone.</i>

20:21.887 --> 20:24.556
<i>So maybe I got
a little bit of satisfaction</i>

20:24.556 --> 20:27.226
<i>when they figured out
I was playing them right back.</i>

20:27.726 --> 20:31.688
<i>See, I was dating both of them
at the same time.</i>

20:31.688 --> 20:35.150
Damn, Ramona.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.152
Sounds familiar.

20:37.152 --> 20:38.987
Familiar? To...?

20:38.987 --> 20:43.492
Someone seeing someone
and also seeing another someone,

20:43.492 --> 20:46.662
and neither of the someones are aware
of the other someone.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.373
Oh. Scott. Us.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.667
Hey, can we get back to the "whodidit"?

20:51.667 --> 20:52.876
Right.

20:52.876 --> 20:58.590
"The how" is a vegan portal
created by vegan powers.

20:58.590 --> 21:04.221
<i>But this portal far exceeded
the power level of my only vegan ex.</i>

21:04.221 --> 21:05.806
<i>And that made me realize...</i>

21:06.807 --> 21:08.976
<i>What's more powerful than a human vegan?</i>

21:09.559 --> 21:10.727
Two human vegans?

21:10.727 --> 21:13.105
No. A robot vegan.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.652
A robot that's never eaten meat.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.365
<i>A robot that's never had any dairy.</i>

21:24.032 --> 21:27.577
<i>A vegan without the inherent flaws
of humanity.</i>

21:28.537 --> 21:32.708
<i>A vegan created by The Twins.</i>

21:39.548 --> 21:42.134
I remembered
where I saw that robot before.

21:46.763 --> 21:50.309
<i>It was at The Rockit
before Sex Bob-omb went on stage.</i>

21:56.857 --> 21:59.901
See? Right before Scott disappeared.

22:13.457 --> 22:17.461
There you have it.
The who, the why, and the how.

22:17.461 --> 22:21.423
Ken and Kyle Katayanagi,
the twins I spurned in college

22:21.423 --> 22:24.259
kidnapped Scott Pilgrim by using
their robot's unique capabilities

22:24.259 --> 22:27.262
to create the most powerful
vegan portal of all time.

22:27.763 --> 22:28.847
It's simple, really.

22:28.847 --> 22:29.973
Wow!

22:29.973 --> 22:35.228
But maybe I missed something.
What about "the where"? Where is he?

22:36.063 --> 22:37.272
We'll know soon enough.

22:37.272 --> 22:41.026
When I find the Twins, I find Scott.

22:44.029 --> 22:48.575
So, about to be reunited with that one guy
you went on one date with one time, eh?

22:48.575 --> 22:49.993
Looks that way.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.244
Are you excited?

22:51.244 --> 22:53.038
That's a pretty big question.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.040
Didn't we come here for a reason?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.416
Oh, yeah, right!

22:57.334 --> 22:58.960
We came here with information.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.587
About your Scott case.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.923
Well, about Young Neil, actually.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.467
Young Neil didn't write that script.

23:05.467 --> 23:08.595
He didn't write
<i>Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life!</i>

23:08.595 --> 23:11.014
Apparently, I didn't write the movie.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.140
Then who did?

23:12.140 --> 23:13.558
We don't know.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.228
We didn't figure out
the who, the why, or the how,

23:16.228 --> 23:19.481
but we did figure out "the when."

23:21.358 --> 23:24.653
I thought someone would say it!
I wasn't pausing for dramatic effect.

23:24.653 --> 23:30.700
According to the file data,
that script was written 14 years from now.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.636
- Hey.
- Scott?

23:50.345 --> 23:51.805
Where have you been?

23:51.805 --> 23:54.182
Was it the Twins? Their robot?

23:54.182 --> 23:55.434
The vegan portal?

23:55.976 --> 23:56.935
Are you okay?

23:56.935 --> 23:57.936
I'm okay.

23:58.645 --> 24:03.859
And yes, it was the Twins,
and their robot, and the vegan portal.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.236
But someone else
was behind the whole thing.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.071
Someone else?

24:08.071 --> 24:09.030
Who?

24:13.869 --> 24:14.828
It was me.

24:16.079 --> 24:16.955
I did it.
