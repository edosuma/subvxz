-Good.

20:41.616 --> 20:42.901
What happened to your mojo, big man?

20:42.992 --> 20:45.734
What do you want me to say?
Dallas had some trouble this off season

20:45.829 --> 20:48.241
and Hal, his knees are stuck together.

20:48.331 --> 20:51.539
But don't worry, I'm gonna loosen them up.
It's just gonna take a little bit more time.

20:51.626 --> 20:52.957
You are killing me. The clock is ticking.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.785
Plus I'm about to throw
Reggie face-first through a fucking wall.

Hey, you think I'm too heavy?

21:49.893 --> 21:52.350
No, Charles. I think you're burly.

-I didn't say anything.
-Reginald, mind your words.

All I'm saying, man, is you gonna let him
do us like this after all we've been through?

23:52.473 --> 23:55.260
It's cool, man. Look, we'rejust talking.

23:55.351 --> 23:58.434
I'm gonna get the car.
I'm gonna see you all back at the crib.

and mad overhead.

24:14.662 --> 24:15.822

you were looking to escape.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.347

When I signed my first contract,
I was the pride of Bethlehem.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.649
The very next day,
half of Pennsylvania had their hands out.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.647
And anybody who did anything nice for me

24:48.738 --> 24:51.104
expected that they were gonna
get a piece Of what I got.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.656
What I earned. And you know what I did?

24:53.743 --> 24:56.450

until I was damn near broke.

pieces to go around, Okay?

they're always gonna want more.

You're like a big brother to me, man.

I'm your financial manager
and lwill put your money to work.
