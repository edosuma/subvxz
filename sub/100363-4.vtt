WEBVTT

00:06.484 --> 00:08.225
- Previously
on "The Magicians"...

00:16.103 --> 00:18.583
- Your new lady Centurion.

00:22.805 --> 00:25.677
- You said you heard voices
from other worlds.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.157
- You hearing something?

00:27.201 --> 00:28.637
- A signal?

00:32.467 --> 00:35.209
Professor, did the signal
make you do that?

00:37.907 --> 00:40.170
- He loved you.

00:40.214 --> 00:42.303
Why would I want to take that
away from you now?

00:42.346 --> 00:45.523
That would be so cruel.

00:45.567 --> 00:48.874
- You really think
I didn't know there was more?

00:48.918 --> 00:51.268
What was I supposed
to do, huh?

00:51.312 --> 00:54.445
Demand that he only love me?

00:54.489 --> 00:56.621
- "Dark King"
is a little generic

00:56.665 --> 00:58.667
as villain names go,
wouldn't you say?

00:58.710 --> 00:59.885
- I have notes.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.626
Although he is
somewhat effective.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.324
Everyone seems terrified
of him.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.891
- Elliot, Taker!
Back up!

01:11.810 --> 01:13.551
- You all right?

01:15.814 --> 01:18.165
Death is so simple...

01:18.208 --> 01:20.297
and life is so complicated.

01:21.603 --> 01:23.300
I know.

01:25.781 --> 01:28.523
- I think I almost fucked
the Dark King.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.394
- Are you familiar with
the Harmonic Convergence?

01:30.438 --> 01:33.354
A rare and powerful
astrological occurrence,

01:33.397 --> 01:34.920
a magnifier of magic.

01:34.964 --> 01:37.401
- How bad will it be?
- Death toll in the millions.

01:37.445 --> 01:38.837
Maybe much higher.
- How can we stop it?

01:38.881 --> 01:40.535
- You can't.

01:46.715 --> 01:48.630
- Hedge witches--
they're used to crumbs.

01:48.673 --> 01:51.154
And, yes, ambient is low, but
you know what amplifies it?

01:51.198 --> 01:52.329
Cooperative magic.

01:52.373 --> 01:54.201
We tell everyone,

01:54.244 --> 01:56.855
and we all do the same thing
at the same time.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.164
And I thought that
if I took on more power

02:01.208 --> 02:03.819
and more responsibility...

02:03.862 --> 02:05.603
that I would want heroin less.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.866
When I thought I'd relapsed,

02:07.910 --> 02:09.694
I was relieved.

02:12.567 --> 02:15.178
So, uh...

02:15.222 --> 02:18.442
I've been clean for a year.

02:20.357 --> 02:23.273
Thanks, but uh,
maybe hold that

02:23.317 --> 02:25.884
'cause I've been jonesing hard.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.934
Uh...

02:31.977 --> 02:34.502
I'm a hedge.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.808
You know, before we helped save
magic, we got a shit deal.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.201
Right?

02:38.245 --> 02:40.334
Oh, there was, uh,
a blood worm scare,

02:40.377 --> 02:42.901
so the Library gave a lot
of hedges the Reed's Mark.

02:42.945 --> 02:44.468
Well, get a mark,

02:44.512 --> 02:46.557
you're magically castrated
till they take it off.

02:46.601 --> 02:49.386
The Library's imploding.
They can't fix it

02:49.430 --> 02:51.475
and the marked ones are looking
at me, like,

02:51.519 --> 02:54.217
"Hey, bossy pants,
you rallied us to save magic.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.827
How about saving us?"

02:55.871 --> 02:59.788
And I found a spell to remove
the marks in a depository.

02:59.831 --> 03:02.660
Only, all of a sudden,
it's gone.

03:02.704 --> 03:06.751
But I know, only way to move
something that warded

03:06.795 --> 03:09.493
is to move it though
the Etheric Realm.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.321
- Cool, I've heard
it's awesome there.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.018
What's the prob?

03:13.062 --> 03:16.500
- The prob...

03:16.544 --> 03:18.763
is there's only one way
into the Realm.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.202
Anybody heard of RCH?

03:23.725 --> 03:25.248
Nickname Archie?

03:28.556 --> 03:31.559
Yep.

03:31.602 --> 03:35.215
The way to save every marked
hedge is to drop acid.

03:36.955 --> 03:39.480
A true 12-step conundrum.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.879
- I'm assuming you have
the Archie on you.

03:47.923 --> 03:50.404
Call your sponsor, kid.

03:50.447 --> 03:53.450
- It'd make sense...

03:53.494 --> 03:55.713
in case somebody here,

03:55.757 --> 03:57.802
you know, gave you permission
to jump off the wagon.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.717
Sorry, M.A. is so strict.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.676
- You met the nice me.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.069
Here's the real me.
Fuck off.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.598
- What?

04:13.731 --> 04:16.343
- Well, I take
the anonymous part

04:16.386 --> 04:19.520
of Magicians Anonymous
very seriously.

04:19.563 --> 04:22.000
- So you quit drinking.

04:22.044 --> 04:24.916
- 33 days, 6 hours,
19 minutes of skin-peeling,

04:24.960 --> 04:27.745
soul-searing hell ago, yes.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.573
- Well, I can relate.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.314
- As can I,

04:31.358 --> 04:33.969
in regards to the crushing
weight of leadership.

04:36.754 --> 04:40.105
I've never seen Archie.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.672
May I?

04:44.893 --> 04:46.721
Why two?

04:48.462 --> 04:50.072
- In case the first trip's
a bust.

04:50.115 --> 04:52.727
- Or in case it's fun.

04:55.077 --> 04:56.818
I've been dismissive

04:56.861 --> 04:58.863
or downright derisive
about hedges,

04:58.907 --> 05:01.866
and I admit,
I was quite wrong.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.129
And I'd like to try
and make, um...

05:04.173 --> 05:05.653
Oh, hell, what's the word?

05:05.696 --> 05:07.394
- Amends.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.787
- Yes.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.403
- Are you crazy?

05:16.446 --> 05:19.971
I am, but I am not an addict.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.583
I am an alcoholic.
Totally different.

05:23.888 --> 05:26.108
- So I will go hunt down
the depository.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.681
- You're not going alone.

05:43.865 --> 05:46.563
- So we know about
the Harmonic Convergence.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.522
The problem is we knew
just enough to be useless.

05:48.565 --> 05:51.525
So maybe we find someone
who can see the big picture.

05:51.568 --> 05:52.830
- "Find."

05:52.874 --> 05:54.441
- Summon.

05:55.529 --> 05:56.747
- A god?

05:58.662 --> 06:00.708
Whoa,
you've got to be kidding me!

06:00.751 --> 06:01.883
- Wait, Julia,
before you do that,

06:01.926 --> 06:03.493
I think the Library
might have--

06:03.537 --> 06:05.887
- Ah. Ooh.
- Penny?

06:05.930 --> 06:07.628
I'm fine.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.412
Wow, that is
a whole nother level.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.500
Jesus.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.110
- I thought the patch
was working.

06:12.154 --> 06:13.764
- Merritt's signal just
keeps getting stronger.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.549
I'm sorry, I can't stay.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.899
I'm--I'm just no use until
I get this under control.

06:17.942 --> 06:20.031
Maybe do the summoning
once I get back?

06:20.075 --> 06:21.990
- Uh, let me know
if things get too weird.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.774
- Uh, yeah, same.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.131
- The Library has summoned me
about 7,000 times

06:33.175 --> 06:34.872
to come work there,

06:34.916 --> 06:36.613
and they also gave me this.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.487
It'll get me in anytime I want.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.140
I'll bring back whatever
they have

06:42.184 --> 06:45.013
on their Harmonic Convergence
as fast as I can.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.449
Are you sure you'll be okay?

06:46.493 --> 06:47.929
- Yeah.
Good luck.

06:47.972 --> 06:50.018
- You too.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.153
- It makes the signal
is hitting you harder.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.720
I'm starting to actually hear--

06:56.764 --> 06:58.156
- A voice?

06:58.200 --> 07:00.811
- You too?
- Kind of.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.813
I can't make out actual words,

07:02.857 --> 07:04.249
at least not ones
I can understand.

07:04.293 --> 07:06.730
- Is that for me?
- No.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.732
The problem with
the first patch was that it

07:08.776 --> 07:10.778
is just a deflector.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.736
The signal is getting
bounced off,

07:12.780 --> 07:14.477
but I'm still getting hit
by the reverb.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.959
This one should absorb
the sound and kill it.

07:18.002 --> 07:20.135
And if it does, we'll see
what we can gin up for you.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.109
Okay.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.503
Better, I think.

07:40.547 --> 07:43.245
- Oh--

07:43.288 --> 07:44.899
Okay.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.949
- What was that?

07:53.211 --> 07:55.649
Where did you go?
- I don't remember.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.694
- You didn't blip out
on purpose.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.957
- No, it's like when the pain
got so I was gonna pass out,

08:00.001 --> 08:01.219
I just--I just went.

08:01.263 --> 08:02.830
- You need a doctor.

08:11.099 --> 08:13.144
- I'm impressed.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.146
Oh, not with this.
It's dreadful.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.322
Sorry.

08:17.366 --> 08:19.890
With your skills
as a Magician.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.283
Who trained you?

08:21.326 --> 08:23.546
- Well, I just picked up
a little bit here and there.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.156
Clearly not enough,

08:25.200 --> 08:26.854
since I couldn't put a scratch
on that Taker.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.986
- Don't be modest.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.032
You have what it takes
to be quite formidable.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.816
I could use you.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.689
Official Court Magician
in Defense of the Kingdom.

08:35.732 --> 08:39.780
You could teach others
and be taught by me.

08:39.823 --> 08:42.086
- I would be honored...

08:44.219 --> 08:45.307
Your Majesty.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.792
Hmm.

08:51.835 --> 08:54.795
A different lining perhaps.
Gray, please.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.238
When we are alone,

09:03.281 --> 09:05.109
it can be Seb.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.329
- Well, Seb,

09:07.372 --> 09:10.027
we have a saying
where I come from.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.726
You kind of buried the lede
on, uh...

09:12.769 --> 09:14.728
on the...

09:14.771 --> 09:17.861
well, on you.

09:17.905 --> 09:20.734
- I didn't mean to deceive you.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.998
Kings have to be very careful
about who to trust.

09:24.041 --> 09:27.610
And also, it can be
a relief to not...

09:27.654 --> 09:29.743
- Feel the weight of the crown
on your head every second?

09:29.786 --> 09:32.354
- You are wise.

09:32.397 --> 09:34.704
But I knew that already.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.972
In any case, settle in,

09:42.016 --> 09:43.670
and we will get down
to the particulars

09:43.713 --> 09:45.367
of your duties later.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.021
All right?

09:47.064 --> 09:49.066
- All right.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.851
Your Majesty.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.424
- Oh, please.
- What?

09:59.468 --> 10:01.818
- If you say his gorgeous eyes
see into your soul,

10:01.862 --> 10:03.298
I'm gonna puke all over
your new leggings,

10:03.341 --> 10:05.082
which are quite sharp,
by the way.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.344
- Thank you.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.738
- Legs for days.
- Ah, thank you.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.261
But I never said his eyes
were gorgeous

10:10.305 --> 10:11.959
or that he sees into my soul.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.656
But weirdly, he might.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.005
- Or he's sucking
the soul out of you

10:15.049 --> 10:16.703
because he doesn't have one.

10:16.746 --> 10:20.141
- Um, he did save my life.
- He's called the Dark King.

10:20.184 --> 10:22.099
- You're called
Margo the Destroyer.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.797
- I was a woman
ruling a patriarchy,

10:23.840 --> 10:25.973
my brand had to be overkill.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.931
Bottom line, he likes you.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.977
You just have to find out
what he's really about.

10:34.198 --> 10:36.374
I'll see if my fellow
Centurions like to gossip.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.768
Then we regroup and decide--

10:38.812 --> 10:41.771
benevolent dictator
by necessity

10:41.815 --> 10:44.731
or psychopathic despot
by choice?

10:44.774 --> 10:47.690
- What if he's the latter?
- Then I always got his back.

10:47.734 --> 10:51.259
Perfect place to bury these.

11:33.388 --> 11:36.043
Zelda.
- Help me, please.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.174
- What's going on?
Who are they?

11:37.218 --> 11:38.436
- Visigoths.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.003
- What, like Marilyn Manson?

11:40.047 --> 11:42.876
- Visi-goths!
- Oh, Germanic barbarians.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.442
- Who always show up
at the absolute worst points

11:44.486 --> 11:45.530
in history.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.990
Fucking hell.

12:10.033 --> 12:12.644
- Oh, sorry.
Did you--did you want Hades?

12:14.342 --> 12:17.780
I could get word to him,
but, ugh, what a dick.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.651
- Are you...

12:19.695 --> 12:21.828
- I'm Clarion,
Goddess of Melody.

12:21.871 --> 12:25.005
Hey, Julia, I have, uh, had my
eye on you for quite a while.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.789
- You have?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.356
- Yeah, yeah.
So you were mortal, right?

12:28.399 --> 12:30.532
And then you were one of us,
and now you're back to mortal.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.012
Whew, you're
one tough cookie, cookie.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.709
- Thanks?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.667
- Yeah, but the way
that you're imagining

12:35.711 --> 12:38.801
the Harmonic Convergence
isn't quite enough.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.847
It's so much worse.

12:40.890 --> 12:44.372
So, when all the spells cast by
all the Magicians go haywire,

12:44.415 --> 12:47.288
you're gonna get earthquakes,
fire, drought,

12:47.331 --> 12:49.638
starvation, plague.

12:49.681 --> 12:50.987
And then comes cannibalism.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.990
- Um, is there anything
you can do?

12:54.034 --> 12:55.731
- I could stop it.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.559
How would that be?
- Great.

12:57.602 --> 13:00.040
But I'm assuming there's
something you want in return.

13:02.694 --> 13:05.828
Yeah, you, uh...

13:05.872 --> 13:07.787
You have dealt
with a god or two.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.051
- Yep.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.661
- I want to be human.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.056
Like you.

13:16.099 --> 13:18.319
- Excuse me?

13:18.362 --> 13:21.713
- I worship you, Julia.

13:23.367 --> 13:24.716
How did you do it, though?

13:24.760 --> 13:26.501
Because that's the part that
I couldn't quite see.

13:26.544 --> 13:27.894
There's, like,
some kind of cloak

13:27.937 --> 13:29.591
around the whole process.

13:29.634 --> 13:33.073
Uh, rumor is it had something
to do with a book.

13:33.116 --> 13:36.946
- Yeah, okay, I'm gonna need
just a few more details...

13:36.990 --> 13:38.818
I don't know,
starting with why.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.776
- Do I want to be human?

13:40.820 --> 13:41.908
Oh, it's simple.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.432
So I'm the Goddess of Melody,
right?

13:44.475 --> 13:47.739
But did you know that
we can't actually feel music?

13:47.783 --> 13:50.873
Like, we understand it, we can
tell the good from the bad--

13:50.917 --> 13:52.788
ah, sort of.

13:52.832 --> 13:56.748
- So you want to be human
so you can do karaoke?

13:56.792 --> 13:59.926
- I know that it sounds
like hubris itself,

13:59.969 --> 14:04.669
but, uh, I think
I could be a rock star.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.802
I mean, I pretty much know
the gig, right?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.456
They all prayed to me.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.458
Except for Amy Winehouse, okay?

14:10.501 --> 14:12.025
Look how that one turned out.
Poor thing.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.722
Any other questions?

14:13.765 --> 14:15.115
- Oh, boy.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.844
This is amazing.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.633
Careful!

14:55.677 --> 14:58.027
- Whoa!

14:58.071 --> 14:59.855
- The world isn't quite gone.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.518
Oh...

15:10.561 --> 15:12.433
this is what my neck
feels like.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.743
Come on!
The depository.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.441
Come on.
- Hmm.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.196
- Welcome!

15:36.239 --> 15:37.719
- H-hi.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.851
Oh!
Oh!

15:39.895 --> 15:42.898
We're looking for a depository
that was, um--

15:42.942 --> 15:43.899
it was over there.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.032
- Eat up.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.990
- Yeah, in a sec, but, uh,

15:48.034 --> 15:49.905
if you know where
the depository is...

15:49.949 --> 15:52.125
- Nobody knows where anything
is in the Realm,

15:52.168 --> 15:53.604
except for the Emperor.

15:53.648 --> 15:54.910
- Dear God.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.565
This is strange.

15:57.608 --> 15:58.958
It tastes like, uh...

16:00.611 --> 16:02.744
Burning charcoal,

16:02.787 --> 16:05.007
hamburgers on a grill.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.881
Popsicles.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.236
- Is that bunny staring at us?

16:16.279 --> 16:19.587
- Summer at the beach.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.067
Brown bunny.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.505
Sunglasses.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.159
Beach clue.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.509
- I'm trying real hard
to give a shit,

16:28.552 --> 16:31.077
but it just feels so good
to be high again.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.556
- Hmm.
- Oh.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.037
- I guess we follow him.

16:35.081 --> 16:38.258
- So we all know the threat
we're facing.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.695
These are Fillory's
second greatest protectors

16:40.738 --> 16:42.175
against the Takers.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.742
Who can tell me the first?

16:44.786 --> 16:46.788
- His Majesty,
the Dark King.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.050
- Which is why protecting him

16:48.094 --> 16:49.965
is the most important job
in the kingdom.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.576
His Majesty is immortal, yes,

16:52.620 --> 16:54.578
but he is not invulnerable.

16:54.622 --> 16:57.016
- Which makes us?

16:57.059 --> 16:59.583
- Expendable.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.633
- A group of royal map makers

17:05.676 --> 17:07.069
won't make it back here
till after dark.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.158
And the First Cohort is trapped
in a blizzard

17:09.202 --> 17:10.812
in Madness Plains.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.553
You wet-nosed whelps
are all we've got.

17:12.596 --> 17:15.947
Well, you, me...

17:17.645 --> 17:20.561
And our glorious leader.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.957
- What are we looking at here?

17:26.001 --> 17:28.221
- His Majesty wants the kingdom
to witness him

17:28.264 --> 17:30.223
saving subjects
from the Takers.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.790
These are in almost
every room of the castle,

17:32.834 --> 17:34.183
most of the taverns, and...

17:43.192 --> 17:45.194
- It's fucking Fox News.

17:45.238 --> 17:48.023
- Foxes all lie.
Who'd ever believe their news?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.677
- His Majesty,
I'm afraid all we have

17:49.720 --> 17:51.070
are the newest recruits.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.680
- Who'll learn by doing.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.856
- Yes, sir.
With me, recruits.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.858
On three.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.338
Quick step now.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.209
Ready, hup.

18:04.735 --> 18:07.086
- Give me a phaser
and a red shirt.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.131
- What?
- Yeah, just don't.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.269
Whoa.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.841
The Binder was annoyed...

18:23.885 --> 18:26.148
but unsurprised
Julia had failed

18:26.192 --> 18:27.758
to burn him out of existence,

18:27.802 --> 18:30.848
per their agreement.

18:30.892 --> 18:34.548
- Look, I just thought maybe
we were both a little hasty

18:34.591 --> 18:37.333
and, I don't know,
maybe I'd keep you safe,

18:37.377 --> 18:39.248
let us both cool down.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.641
So can you do it?

18:40.684 --> 18:44.166
- The Binder stared at Julia...

18:44.210 --> 18:45.863
wondering
if she'd learned nothing

18:45.907 --> 18:48.301
from her interactions
with deities.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.564
- I don't have a lot
of choice here, okay?

18:50.607 --> 18:52.566
If you can't do this,
the Earth is doomed.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.656
- Hmm, "Again?"
The Binder asked...

18:55.699 --> 18:58.398
bored.

18:58.441 --> 19:01.488
Still, the Binder wondered,

19:01.531 --> 19:06.493
"Why on Earth would Julia
trust this 'Clarion'?"

19:06.536 --> 19:10.410
- I don't, but the options
here are narrowing.

19:10.453 --> 19:14.544
- As a book, the Binder enjoyed
any opportunity to teach.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.198
And here was a word

19:16.242 --> 19:18.374
Julia needed desperately
to understand--

19:20.942 --> 19:22.683
No.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.730
- So are these
the same Visigoths

19:26.774 --> 19:28.558
that raided cultural
strongholds on Earth?

19:28.602 --> 19:30.212
- Mm, burned
the Library of Alexandria,

19:30.256 --> 19:31.909
sacked the statuary
of Ancient Greece,

19:31.953 --> 19:34.434
burned Rome, London,
Paris, Chicago,

19:34.477 --> 19:36.740
where they framed poor
Mrs. O'Leary's cow.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.481
That's around the time
they started getting bored

19:38.525 --> 19:39.874
and moved into the multiverse.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.441
- Okay,
I'm sorry about all this,

19:41.484 --> 19:42.833
but I need every book
you have

19:42.877 --> 19:44.400
on the Harmonic Convergence.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.750
- We have a vast collection
on the other side of that door.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.578
- Oh, wow.
Well, my timing is--

19:57.239 --> 19:58.806
- How do you do?

19:58.849 --> 20:01.200
I'm Visigoth Overlord Terence.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.810
Apologies for the mess,

20:02.853 --> 20:05.508
but recall,
I did announce our incursion

20:05.552 --> 20:07.293
and asked you most politely

20:07.336 --> 20:09.295
to drop all your defenses
and surrender,

20:09.338 --> 20:11.427
having given my word

20:11.471 --> 20:13.777
that you would
be absolutely safe.

20:13.821 --> 20:16.389
But the word of a barbarian?

20:16.432 --> 20:18.304
- Actually,
Visigoths are famous

20:18.347 --> 20:19.740
for always keeping their word.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.785
- Oh, that's weird.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.962
- My dear, if you'd be so kind.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.314
- Sorry, I'm just
a little confused here,

20:28.357 --> 20:29.793
but you seem...

20:29.837 --> 20:32.579
- Educated?
Polite to a fault?

20:32.622 --> 20:35.712
We seek to acquire only
the deepest knowledge,

20:35.756 --> 20:37.410
highest art,

20:37.453 --> 20:38.759
and most illuminating
philosophy.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.935
Is it any wonder
a little might rub off?

20:40.978 --> 20:42.719
- What about all those
inconvenient commandments

20:42.763 --> 20:44.330
about theft?

20:44.373 --> 20:45.635
- Alice, it's no use debating.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.507
- Alice, is it?

20:47.550 --> 20:48.899
That's lovely.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.814
- Thank you?

20:50.858 --> 20:54.253
- We seek only those works that
transcend appetite and avarice,

20:54.296 --> 20:56.342
that touch upon the immutable.

20:56.385 --> 20:59.301
That's why we spend so little
time on Earth anymore.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.738
What's left to raid?

21:01.782 --> 21:03.697
Tent pole franchises?

21:03.740 --> 21:06.874
Jeff Koons?
The, um...

21:06.917 --> 21:08.310
hoodie?

21:08.354 --> 21:09.616
- Visigoths never lie,

21:09.659 --> 21:12.009
but they never tell
the whole truth either.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.663
I know what you're
really after.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.288
- The books of everyone...

21:29.331 --> 21:30.506
- Is actually what they want.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.029
Every sentient being's life,
birth to death.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.683
Can you imagine?

21:33.727 --> 21:35.511
They could plan the pillaging
of every great work

21:35.555 --> 21:37.034
before it's painted
or written.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.688
Not to mention
the stock market.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.342
- "Stock market"?

21:40.386 --> 21:41.517
- They have a thing
about shorting.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.040
They think it's hilarious.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.651
- Look, Zelda, I understand
how important this is to you,

21:44.694 --> 21:46.043
but what's the point?

21:46.087 --> 21:47.871
They're gonna get in here,
and this is the only door.

21:49.438 --> 21:51.048
- Okay, how about this?

21:51.092 --> 21:53.529
You want to teach?
Teach.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.052
"You?

21:55.096 --> 21:57.533
To turn a goddess mortal?"

21:57.577 --> 22:01.363
The Binder inquired, with not
a small amount of disdain.

22:01.407 --> 22:02.756
- Hmm.

22:02.799 --> 22:04.627
Too tough?

22:04.671 --> 22:06.934
Fine.

22:06.977 --> 22:08.849
Maybe I'll just hand you
to her.

22:08.892 --> 22:12.331
- Ah, the Binder realized Julia
had cornered him

22:12.374 --> 22:14.637
with his own credo.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.900
But still, he wondered,

22:16.944 --> 22:18.946
what was in it for him?

22:18.989 --> 22:21.601
- Well, how's this,
paper boy?

22:23.733 --> 22:26.736
- Said the Binder...

22:26.780 --> 22:29.043
"Let the lessons commence."

22:36.572 --> 22:40.576
- Whoa!

22:50.456 --> 22:51.848
Oh, oh...

22:57.811 --> 22:59.813
Socks?

22:59.856 --> 23:01.423
None of them match.

23:07.473 --> 23:10.432
- So this is where they go.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.870
If you see
a red and orange argyle,

23:13.914 --> 23:15.959
cashmere, size 13,

23:16.003 --> 23:17.439
grab it, please.

23:17.483 --> 23:18.919
- Oh.

23:18.962 --> 23:21.704
I don't usually say this
when I'm this high,

23:21.748 --> 23:24.054
but we really need to focus.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.622
- Exactly.
Red and orange.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.145
- Yeah.

23:28.189 --> 23:30.626
No, no,
we're looking for, uh...

23:30.670 --> 23:32.628
- Christ!
- Uh...

23:32.672 --> 23:35.152
- I don't believe it.
There it is.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.461
- Oh!

23:39.505 --> 23:40.984
- You were right.

23:41.028 --> 23:43.073
Just needed to focus.

23:43.117 --> 23:44.945
- Mmm...

23:44.988 --> 23:46.816
- Oh, bunny.
Bunny.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.866
Oh.

23:54.041 --> 23:56.783
Um, hi.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.828
Uh...

23:58.872 --> 24:01.091
we're looking for an emperor.

24:01.135 --> 24:02.484
- Hey, Kady.

24:03.877 --> 24:05.139
Hank.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.837
- Hank.
I don't hate that.

24:07.881 --> 24:11.493
- You know us?

24:11.537 --> 24:14.496
- What kind of an emp
would I be if I didn't?

24:14.540 --> 24:16.063
You roll into my town,

24:16.106 --> 24:18.065
I take a gander
at your thoughts,

24:18.108 --> 24:20.807
and if I dig ya,
I show you the brown bunny.

24:20.850 --> 24:23.026
And I dig ya both.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.551
Congratulations
on the first sock.

24:27.074 --> 24:29.685
How great is Archie,
by the way?

24:31.078 --> 24:33.602
- Pretty great,
once you let it settle in.

24:33.646 --> 24:36.083
- And as long as you're here,

24:36.126 --> 24:38.215
the high never goes away.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.654
- Wow.
That's, uh--

24:41.697 --> 24:43.525
- That's perfect.
- Yeah.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.528
We--we really need
to find the, uh...

24:46.572 --> 24:49.705
Oh, Jesus.
The--the...

24:49.749 --> 24:51.185
- Depository, Kady.

24:51.228 --> 24:52.839
- Right, right.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.884
Uh, can you tell us
where that is now?

24:54.928 --> 24:56.582
- Sure can.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.888
It won't be free, though.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.021
Even here
where everything's fun,

25:01.064 --> 25:02.544
there's a price.

25:04.241 --> 25:07.027
Sit.
Have some suds.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.724
This'll take a sec.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.509
- What will?

25:10.552 --> 25:13.120
- For me to dig deeper
into your thoughts,

25:13.163 --> 25:16.906
see which one of you
gets to leave...

25:16.950 --> 25:19.082
and who has to stay.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.087
Mmm...

25:33.009 --> 25:35.098
- The map makers are in there.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.538
- Do you hear that?

25:41.540 --> 25:44.630
- Oh, boy.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.806
- Breathing.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.590
Coming from there.

25:48.634 --> 25:52.072
- With respect, Majesty,
there.

25:52.115 --> 25:54.117
- Guys, there.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.556
There, there.
We're surrounded.

25:57.599 --> 25:58.687
- You can see them?

25:58.731 --> 26:00.036
- I have really good
night vision.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.038
My grandpa married
a snow leopard,

26:02.082 --> 26:03.213
is the rumor.

26:03.257 --> 26:05.564
- Sire.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.568
- Where is he going?

26:12.005 --> 26:13.876
- Oh, I've seen that before.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.617
It's a legit royal tactic.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.053
Never fear.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.622
- Shouldn't we get him
to the infirmary?

26:22.015 --> 26:23.799
With all the newbies
practicing during surges,

26:23.843 --> 26:25.801
it's like a meat locker
down there

26:25.845 --> 26:29.631
where the meat's alive...
until it's not.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.111
- Ah!

26:31.154 --> 26:32.547
- Penny?

26:33.679 --> 26:35.768
- Get...

26:35.811 --> 26:36.943
Julia.

26:36.986 --> 26:38.074
- Who?

26:53.481 --> 26:55.309
- So our Dark King--

26:55.352 --> 26:56.658
did he just shit the doublet?

26:58.486 --> 27:00.096
I hope so.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.142
I really don't want to be
the only one who does it with--

28:04.204 --> 28:06.336
That's amazing, right?

28:06.380 --> 28:09.165
I mean, honestly,
fuck Netflix.

28:09.209 --> 28:10.384
That is peak television.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.212
- Jesus.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.389
No kidding.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.304
You kick some serious ass
for your kingdom.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.321
Pretty cool.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.410
You're both equally awesome,

28:36.453 --> 28:39.239
by which I mean,
totally fucked up.

28:39.282 --> 28:41.894
By which I mean,
I get you're on a mission.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.504
One of you has got to jet,

28:43.547 --> 28:46.725
but either one of you
can hang for eternity.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.250
You guys decide.

28:50.293 --> 28:52.600
- I'll stay.
- No, you will not.

28:52.643 --> 28:53.819
- Are you kidding?

28:53.862 --> 28:55.908
This place is heroin heaven.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.823
- And a billion times
better than

28:57.866 --> 28:59.781
Isabella Islay single malt.

28:59.825 --> 29:02.262
Look it up when you get back.
I'm staying.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.438
- You've got students
counting on you.

29:04.481 --> 29:05.918
- And I've had it with
the goddamn lot of them,

29:05.961 --> 29:07.746
all 40 timeline's worth.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.269
I never really knew
how sick of them I was

29:09.312 --> 29:10.400
until I stopped drinking.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.925
I've earned the right
to step off

29:12.968 --> 29:15.144
and do Tai Chi with the Elvi.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.496
- I want this as much as you.

29:19.540 --> 29:21.585
As soon as he tells you
where the depository is--

29:22.804 --> 29:25.241
Sorry, Kady,
but you just revealed

29:25.285 --> 29:27.287
to the entire
studio audience

29:27.330 --> 29:31.726
that you're hanging onto
a thread of responsible intent,

29:31.770 --> 29:34.468
which could make you
kind of a bum hang

29:34.511 --> 29:35.774
in 100 years or so.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.690
Hank, on the other hand...
Mm!

29:40.953 --> 29:43.912
Is laidback mondo perfectus.

29:43.956 --> 29:46.306
- Hey...

29:46.349 --> 29:48.221
you don't really want this.

29:48.264 --> 29:51.224
- Kady, sweet Kady.

29:51.267 --> 29:53.879
- I'm sorry I did this to you.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.837
I had no right.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.839
- My whole life,

29:57.883 --> 30:00.668
all this senseless worry,

30:00.711 --> 30:03.845
suffering and pain,

30:03.889 --> 30:07.806
both inflicted and received...

30:07.849 --> 30:09.851
it wasn't for nothing.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.985
It guided me here.

30:13.028 --> 30:15.509
And you were right.

30:15.552 --> 30:17.467
I am home.

30:23.909 --> 30:25.824
- I'll be back, okay?

30:25.867 --> 30:27.651
I promise.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.828
- Goodie.
See you soon.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.499
- Use your key.
Go.

30:49.543 --> 30:52.372
- I'm not going without you.
- I can't.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.896
- Do you really want to die
for a bunch of books?

30:56.811 --> 31:00.467
- If I could do it all again...

31:00.510 --> 31:03.296
I'd be a better mother...

31:03.339 --> 31:05.298
a truer friend.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.650
But I wasn't.

31:09.693 --> 31:10.869
I'm not.

31:12.348 --> 31:15.482
Because I've given
my life to this.

31:15.525 --> 31:19.747
It's all I am.
It's all I have.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.575
I can't lose everything.

31:21.618 --> 31:22.750
- You can.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.665
Believe me, I have.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.843
I'm sorry about Quentin...

31:30.453 --> 31:31.715
But this is different.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.065
- No, it's not.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.634
Because whoever,
whatever you love

31:37.678 --> 31:40.072
that gets ripped away from you,

31:40.115 --> 31:43.989
it stays alive
inside of us...

31:44.032 --> 31:46.078
and anyone
you share it with.

31:46.121 --> 31:48.776
- I can't.
I can't.

31:50.734 --> 31:53.433
I'm not strong enough.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.742
- Stopping her signal
is impossible.

31:58.786 --> 32:00.657
It's coming from a place
that I can't reach,

32:00.701 --> 32:02.094
but I could save him.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.444
- Then do it now.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.794
- I'll just need you
to give me what we agreed to.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.013
- And the rest of it?

32:08.056 --> 32:09.753
- Rest of what?

32:09.797 --> 32:11.712
- The part where you save
the planet?

32:11.755 --> 32:14.933
- You have one thing to trade,
Julia, for one miracle.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.761
So your miracle can be
to save your boyfriend

32:17.805 --> 32:20.982
or your world.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.897
- But you could save both.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.029
- You know what?

32:24.072 --> 32:25.726
Humans have exploited gods

32:25.769 --> 32:27.597
since you guys
staggered upright.

32:27.641 --> 32:30.122
The deals that we make
need to be strict.

32:30.165 --> 32:32.863
So this deal--
one book, one miracle.

32:32.907 --> 32:35.649
- You're really gonna
make me choose?

32:35.692 --> 32:37.738
The planet or him.
- Yeah.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.783
I know, it's
total bullshit, right?

32:39.827 --> 32:41.524
You see why I want to be
a human?

32:41.568 --> 32:43.744
Like, I can't feel the melodies
I'm goddess of,

32:43.787 --> 32:46.529
can't bend the rules
I didn't make, eh...

32:46.573 --> 32:48.140
- Don't put this on your kind.

32:48.183 --> 32:50.490
This is you choosing.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.709
- But the one who has
to choose is you.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.845
I'd say he has
about a minute left.

33:15.515 --> 33:17.343
- I feel...

33:18.692 --> 33:19.998
Better.

33:21.521 --> 33:24.176
So why do I feel like something
really shitty went down?

33:26.526 --> 33:28.310
Maybe because you're here.

33:28.354 --> 33:32.445
- Like all humans,
23 saw little and knew less.

33:32.488 --> 33:37.145
What strange, sad, angry,
narrow little lives

33:37.189 --> 33:39.321
these humans stumbled through.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.193
- Okay, just tell me
what you did to me.

33:41.236 --> 33:42.672
- I helped you,

33:42.716 --> 33:46.154
and now you're going
to help me.

33:46.198 --> 33:48.113
- The Binder
reminded the goddess,

33:48.156 --> 33:50.637
he couldn't be forced
to do anything

33:50.680 --> 33:52.508
he didn't wish to.

33:52.552 --> 33:56.121
- Oh, honey,
I don't force anyone.

33:56.164 --> 33:57.383
I just get what I want.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.037
Good-bye, Julia.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.342
And for what it's worth,

34:00.386 --> 34:01.952
I feel like you made
the right decision.

34:01.996 --> 34:04.564
- For what it's worth,
go fuck yourself.

34:13.616 --> 34:15.183
That's all of them, sir.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.359
None harmed.

34:17.403 --> 34:18.621
We'll secure the site.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.406
You should go back
with the map makers.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.154
- It kind of feels
a little abrupt, you know?

34:29.197 --> 34:30.720
It kind of felt like
he was gearing up

34:30.764 --> 34:31.982
to make a big speech.

34:32.026 --> 34:33.375
It was just...

34:33.419 --> 34:36.117
- Wait.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.380
Back inside, now.

34:38.424 --> 34:40.687
- Excuse me, sir, but wasn't
this a rescue mission?

34:40.730 --> 34:44.256
A super-successful one
that's over?

34:44.299 --> 34:46.345
- Inside.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.744
- So I-I take it she's
the god you summoned,

34:54.788 --> 34:58.444
who is not going
to save the world for us?

34:58.487 --> 35:00.576
- Look, we'll figure
something else out.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.404
We've got time.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.145
- There's more, isn't there?

35:06.452 --> 35:08.584
- Anyone else need a drink?

35:11.196 --> 35:13.154
- Look, the signal
was killing you.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.287
I did what needed
to be done now,

35:15.330 --> 35:17.550
but she didn't have time
to be delicate.

35:17.593 --> 35:20.248
She just--

35:20.292 --> 35:22.032
She said that
the only way was--

35:22.076 --> 35:24.600
- Take away
my psychic abilities.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.996
Yeah, 'cause...

35:30.432 --> 35:34.523
I'm not getting
Merritt's signal anymore or...

35:36.699 --> 35:39.137
Anybody's thoughts here

35:39.180 --> 35:41.443
or anywhere.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.316
Wow.

35:45.491 --> 35:47.319
So this is quiet.

35:49.277 --> 35:52.193
It is fucking weird.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.282
- You can't travel anymore.

35:54.326 --> 35:56.545
- Technically, I can.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.591
It'd just be like
flying a jet blind.

35:58.634 --> 36:00.810
And since I'm not suicidal, I--

36:00.854 --> 36:03.161
- I'm sorry, Penny.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.554
- No, we just settled a really
big spiritual argument here.

36:07.513 --> 36:10.385
There is for sure
instant karma.

36:10.429 --> 36:11.734
- If there had been
more time...

36:11.778 --> 36:13.301
- Come on.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.782
You got to appreciate
the balance of it...

36:15.825 --> 36:18.350
the irony.

36:18.393 --> 36:21.614
I had to make
a choice for you.

36:21.657 --> 36:25.183
You had to make
a choice for me

36:25.226 --> 36:28.229
It is fucking radiant.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.623
- Um...

36:30.666 --> 36:32.320
Uh...

36:32.364 --> 36:34.366
this...

36:34.409 --> 36:37.717
This, oh, uh...

36:37.760 --> 36:39.675
this happened...

36:41.634 --> 36:44.419
This is because of me.

36:44.463 --> 36:45.812
I didn't see it coming,

36:45.855 --> 36:47.857
and I never thought
it was gonna get this bad.

36:47.901 --> 36:49.424
- Merritt,
what could you have done?

36:49.468 --> 36:51.252
I should've told the truth.

36:51.296 --> 36:55.125
My name,
my real name, is Plum.

36:57.258 --> 37:01.697
Plum Merritt Chatwin.

37:01.741 --> 37:04.874
- Wait.
- You're a Chatwin?

37:04.918 --> 37:06.876
- Wait, what do you mean?
Like the kid's books?

37:06.920 --> 37:08.269
I missed an episode.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.880
- I am so sorry.

37:10.924 --> 37:13.883
I was terrified and alone,

37:13.927 --> 37:18.671
and being here was
the first time I felt safe,

37:18.714 --> 37:21.282
but I'm not.

37:21.326 --> 37:24.459
The thing with being a Chatwin
is it's like a curse.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.156
It's like there
are things coming after you

37:26.200 --> 37:27.593
that we just don't understand.

37:27.636 --> 37:29.638
I don't know
what this signal is,

37:29.682 --> 37:31.292
but I know why it's
targeting me,

37:31.336 --> 37:32.641
and I am gonna figure out...

37:32.685 --> 37:33.903
- Whoa, whoa.
Hang on! Hang on!

37:33.947 --> 37:35.427
- No, you don't know
what that's gonna do.

37:39.909 --> 37:42.477
You're right.

37:42.521 --> 37:44.262
- Wha--

37:51.747 --> 37:53.314
- Funny thing

37:53.358 --> 37:56.361
about doing the same thing
over and over again--

37:56.404 --> 37:58.406
you learn how to do it better.

37:59.929 --> 38:02.236
- I suppose that's the true
purpose of a library, no?

38:02.280 --> 38:05.283
Ah, your treasured tomes--

38:05.326 --> 38:08.590
each one a life...

38:08.634 --> 38:10.418
a destiny.

38:10.462 --> 38:13.421
- I'm most curious about who
my next few wives will be.

38:13.465 --> 38:16.337
You never know, Alice.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.779
Let's go find our books,
shall we?

38:28.523 --> 38:30.395
Something to add,
Madam Librarian?

38:30.438 --> 38:33.441
- Yes, if you really want
to know your future,

38:33.485 --> 38:35.922
you better be able
to speed-read.

38:38.272 --> 38:39.969
- No!

38:40.013 --> 38:42.798
No, no!

38:42.842 --> 38:44.452
No, no, no, no, no!

39:08.346 --> 39:09.347
- Enter.

39:24.927 --> 39:27.016
- I was just checking

39:27.060 --> 39:29.062
to make sure
you were all right.

39:29.105 --> 39:31.804
- Thank you for your concern.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.371
I'm fine.

39:34.981 --> 39:37.244
Just a bit tired.

39:37.287 --> 39:40.290
- I can imagine.

39:42.292 --> 39:44.469
You were incredible out there.

39:44.512 --> 39:47.297
- Maybe once.

39:47.341 --> 39:49.735
Now it's, um...

39:49.778 --> 39:52.041
What's the military term?

39:52.085 --> 39:54.827
Holding action.

39:54.870 --> 39:58.004
Nothing but holding actions.

39:58.047 --> 40:02.312
- I saw that not
all the Centurions returned.

40:10.103 --> 40:11.887
Good night, Seb.

40:19.242 --> 40:22.332
- What exactly are
we looking for, sir?

40:22.376 --> 40:24.509
- Not what.
Who.

40:24.552 --> 40:27.294
Well, both.

41:03.156 --> 41:04.200
- Grab it!
Grab it!

41:15.908 --> 41:18.476
- You two know each other?

41:18.519 --> 41:19.781
- No.

41:22.305 --> 41:25.047
- Then you won't mind taking
charge of its imprisonment.

41:25.091 --> 41:27.093
- Of course not, sir.

41:41.542 --> 41:45.590
- And all the books
on everyone are gone...

41:45.633 --> 41:47.461
for good.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.202
- Maybe that means
actual free will now

41:49.245 --> 41:52.901
and not any
of that predestined shit.

41:57.036 --> 41:59.342
- Or lots of rewrites to do.

41:59.386 --> 42:02.476
Sorry, Zelda.
It's a bad day for everybody.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.044
- At least the fires
drove them out.

42:05.087 --> 42:07.089
We think they got
about half the collection.

42:07.133 --> 42:10.005
- Mm, yep, and everything
on the Convergence.

42:10.049 --> 42:11.485
- So what do we now?

42:11.529 --> 42:13.966
We try and trade
with the Visigoths?

42:14.009 --> 42:17.012
What do we have that they want?

42:17.056 --> 42:19.406
- I mean, the Overlord
kind of liked me.

42:19.449 --> 42:21.887
- Off the table.

42:21.930 --> 42:24.629
- I read most of the books
on the Convergence...

42:24.672 --> 42:26.979
enough to know
it can be stopped.

42:27.022 --> 42:31.331
It's almost impossible
but not complicated.

42:35.509 --> 42:37.903
- Zelda, please tell.

42:37.946 --> 42:40.340
- Oh, of course.

42:40.383 --> 42:45.171
Well, all you have to do
is move...

42:45.214 --> 42:46.912
that.

42:46.955 --> 42:48.609
- Move?

42:48.653 --> 42:51.003
- The fucking moon.

42:52.482 --> 42:54.615
Well, at least we know
where it is.
