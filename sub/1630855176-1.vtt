00:34.040 --> 00:35.808
Mackenzie: Alright. Here we go.

00:35.850 --> 00:39.358
Mackenzie: If anything happens,
that $30 goes to my mom's new car.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.568
Realistically, if anything happens-

00:41.610 --> 00:45.188
you guys get in trouble for encouraging
me to do this in the first place.

00:45.230 --> 00:48.498
It's not my fault I need the money
and you guys took advantage of that.

00:48.540 --> 00:50.000
Just saying.

04:09.090 --> 04:12.518
Sorry. I - I didn't think to try to show her.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.108
I guess, um, trying to get smooth
video when you're about to die-

04:16.150 --> 04:18.400
is not my first instinct.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.708
I don't feel well.

04:34.290 --> 04:38.390
That was not worth $30. But I'll take it.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.908
Mackenzie: Hi, uh, Elizabeth?

06:21.950 --> 06:23.208
I'm Mackenzie.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.298
Liz: Hi, uh.

06:25.340 --> 06:27.828
Where did your parents park?

06:27.870 --> 06:30.450
Oh, um, it's just me. I rode my bike here.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.488
Oh, thank you.

06:38.530 --> 06:42.228
Liz: Sure. I figured after a
long ride you might be thirsty.

06:42.270 --> 06:45.790
Mackenzie: I have a thermos on my bike I
just didn't want to bring it up to the door.

06:46.790 --> 06:48.128
Why?

06:48.170 --> 06:50.198
Feels unprofessional.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.278
Unprofessional?

06:52.320 --> 06:55.658
Could you imagine a grownup
just waltzing into a job interview-

06:55.700 --> 06:58.418
with a big, obnoxious pink thermos?

06:58.460 --> 07:00.978
Yeah, I guess - probably not.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.638
Exactly.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.048
Liz: So, you take this that seriously?

07:05.090 --> 07:06.488
Mackenzie: Of course I do.

07:06.530 --> 07:08.258
You - any guardian or parent-

07:08.300 --> 07:11.608
You're entrusting me with the
safety of, not only your house,

07:11.650 --> 07:15.488
but your most precious possession.
So I better take it seriously.

07:15.530 --> 07:18.208
That's uh...

07:18.250 --> 07:20.690
That's a refreshing point of view.

07:23.490 --> 07:26.178
I talked to your references, uh.

07:26.220 --> 07:30.178
Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Long, Mr. Breck.

07:30.220 --> 07:34.198
They all said you were great. And they
mentioned your fine attention to detail.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.648
I thought they might.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.548
Can I ask why you like babysitting?

07:39.590 --> 07:42.098
I've always been good with kids. Younger kids.

07:42.140 --> 07:46.018
I have a little brother and sister - twins.
And I've always helped out with them.

07:46.060 --> 07:50.040
So, I'm good with kids and I like making
money. So babysitting is like - perfect.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.528
I see.

07:53.570 --> 07:56.638
Uh - you're sure your parents don't want to meet me?

07:56.680 --> 08:00.738
They're okay with you spending the night over here?

08:00.780 --> 08:03.580
Yep. They know where I am and they trust me.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.288
Yeah, uh...

08:08.330 --> 08:10.288
Let me...

08:10.330 --> 08:13.958
...give you a tour of the house and...

08:14.000 --> 08:15.578
Liz: We'll see you on Friday.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.818
Alright. Thanks, Elizabeth.

08:17.860 --> 08:22.938
Call me Liz.

08:22.980 --> 08:26.958
That's the basement. It's off limits
so don't let Peyton tell you otherwise.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.830
Sure, no problem.

08:29.630 --> 08:31.378
You're not going to ask why it's off limits?

08:31.420 --> 08:34.948
It's none of my business but - if you're offering...

08:34.990 --> 08:39.408
It's under construction and it's just uh - not safe.

08:39.450 --> 08:40.708
Not even the stairs.

08:40.750 --> 08:44.658
Alright, we'll stay away. >>Good.
Let me show you the last bedroom.

08:44.700 --> 08:48.958
That's where you can sleep if you->>I
don't mind the couch. It looks comfy.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.888
Well, let me show you anyway.
Just so you have your options.

08:56.940 --> 09:00.078
That's my Dad. One moment.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.200
Sure. >>Liz: Hey Dad.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.940
Liz: Yeah. Uh-huh.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.738
Liz: Whoa. You okay? >>Mackenzie: Yeah.

10:10.780 --> 10:12.478
Mackenzie: Yeah, uh.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.670
The door just... opened.

10:16.270 --> 10:18.438
It's usually locked.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.218
Liz: But there's a window open down there.

10:21.260 --> 10:25.478
So... it'll blow open if it's ajar even a little.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.490
Okay.

10:27.990 --> 10:31.158
Well, uh. Let's.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.870
Let's see the last room.

10:57.030 --> 10:58.768
Did you really just do that?

10:58.810 --> 11:01.058
Cammy: I'm getting bored back here, hurry it up.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.878
Well, that's not going to help, genius.

11:02.920 --> 11:08.938
Well, it entertained me. You almost jumped
out of your chair and I got it on camera.

11:08.980 --> 11:11.660
Hey. That could've fallen on the floor, are you crazy?

11:14.160 --> 11:16.778
Cammy: Ow.

11:16.820 --> 11:19.098
I almost broke my neck. That wasn't funny.

11:19.140 --> 11:21.798
I hope you were still recording.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.128
I was.

11:23.170 --> 11:25.000
>>Cammy: You're so dead when I get up.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.478
Did you finish that report yet?

11:45.520 --> 11:47.328
Almost.

11:47.370 --> 11:50.828
Get it done. And keep it down in here, it's a school night.

11:50.870 --> 11:53.968
Birthday exceptions don't mean
you can horse around all night.

11:54.010 --> 11:55.378
Okay, sorry.

11:55.420 --> 11:57.100
Sorry Mr. Vincent, we'll be quieter.

12:00.660 --> 12:01.800
Alright.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.538
You can't horse around all night.

12:07.580 --> 12:10.218
Stop it. Before your Dad yells at me again.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.080
Don't start nothin', won't be nothin'.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.858
Don't ever say that again.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.150
Cammy. Cammy, wake up.

14:14.850 --> 14:16.558
What are you doing?

14:16.600 --> 14:18.640
The door opened by itself.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.688
Your Dad probably opened it. Just close it.

14:22.730 --> 14:23.900
Cammy: Go to bed.

15:33.330 --> 15:35.000
Are you girls alright?

15:59.890 --> 16:01.438
Hey, what's up?

16:01.480 --> 16:03.438
I'm just getting ready for practice.

16:03.480 --> 16:06.848
Cammy: Are you still babysitting?
Duh. Why wouldn't I be?

16:06.890 --> 16:10.288
Um, because their house is obviously haunted.

16:10.330 --> 16:13.018
And whatever's there followed you
home and scared the hell out of us.

16:13.060 --> 16:16.058
How do you know it came
from there and not the cornfield?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.078
What do you mean?

16:17.120 --> 16:20.518
The cornfield I went into.
Cammy: Which I told you not to do.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.508
Cammy: For the record. >>Whatever.

16:22.550 --> 16:28.328
Behind it, there's woods. A stream.
And on the other side another cornfield.

16:28.370 --> 16:30.108
The one on Valley Boulevard.

16:30.150 --> 16:31.748
Right.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.438
They say there's a woman in white haunting there.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.608
She resembles a girl who went missing in the 80's.

16:37.650 --> 16:40.868
Mackenzie: They say she was sacrificed to some demon.

16:40.910 --> 16:45.828
Cammy: Yeah. And it takes on her form
and tricks people into sacrificing to it.

16:45.870 --> 16:49.608
Yeah. Heather Morris committed suicide there.

16:49.650 --> 16:52.448
And another guy got stabbed.
Which is why they closed the road.

16:52.490 --> 16:54.558
So people wouldn't go in.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.898
Because of the deaths not because
they believe it was really haunted.

16:57.940 --> 17:01.908
I don't know. But the cornfield
that I went to was really close.

17:01.950 --> 17:04.568
Mackenzie: Like, not even two miles away.

17:04.610 --> 17:07.038
Mackenzie: If something was going on there, then-

17:07.080 --> 17:09.408
Cammy: What? You think it followed you or something?

17:09.450 --> 17:13.938
I'm not sure but whatever
happened last night was really creepy.

17:13.980 --> 17:16.558
Cammy: Well if it makes you feel any better...

17:16.600 --> 17:20.058
Cammy: Any of the stories I've heard
have all been based on Valley Boulevard.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.408
Sounds dumb, but...

17:22.450 --> 17:25.520
Hopefully if there's something
there, it's trapped there.

17:27.020 --> 17:31.198
Cammy: You scared? >>No,
just trying to figure everything out.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.118
Anyway, I better go.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.910
I want to start biking there before
it gets dark. >>Cammy: Good idea.

18:02.510 --> 18:05.188
Peyton: If I chip in a dollar,
could you help me with this?

18:05.230 --> 18:07.638
You don't have to pay me to help you with your homework.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.488
That's kinda part of the job.

18:10.530 --> 18:14.540
I don't really want your help.
I just want you to do the rest.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.108
You have four problems left.

18:17.150 --> 18:19.570
Five. If you don't just do it for me.

18:20.370 --> 18:23.548
You'll need more than a dollar.

18:23.590 --> 18:26.348
Fine. Just don't fall asleep tonight.

18:26.390 --> 18:27.818
Why not?

18:27.860 --> 18:31.528
Cuz, I'll wake up and trash
the house so you lose your tip.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.270
It's going to be one of those nights, isn't it?

18:38.270 --> 18:39.980
You're doing fine.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.230
Liz, you okay?

18:48.730 --> 18:51.258
Liz?

18:51.300 --> 18:52.338
Yes?

18:52.380 --> 18:54.158
You okay?

18:54.200 --> 18:55.728
Yeah.

18:55.770 --> 18:58.978
Uh, I - I put the Grub Hub order in.

18:59.020 --> 19:01.158
Liz: Food should be dropped off at 7.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.058
Peyton's bedtime is 8:30.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.890
It's the weekend.

19:05.790 --> 19:06.888
9:30.

19:06.930 --> 19:09.638
Liz: 10 at the latest. >>Yes ma'am.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.100
Come to the door with me?

19:17.280 --> 19:19.530
Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve.

19:25.530 --> 19:29.228
Um, don't open the door for the delivery.

19:29.270 --> 19:33.430
Liz: There won't be a car in the driveway,
so if they just see you here, then -

19:34.030 --> 19:37.718
I don't want anything to happen. You never know.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.068
Liz: I'll text you when I get a
notification that the food's here.

19:41.110 --> 19:44.068
And I'll send you a picture
of what the driver looks like.

19:44.110 --> 19:45.958
So you know who it's supposed to be.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.518
Sure. No problem.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.678
Liz: It's contact-less delivery but...

19:49.720 --> 19:52.428
Sometimes they still knock. I don't know why.

19:52.470 --> 19:55.708
Habit, maybe? Or they're just stupid.

19:55.750 --> 19:58.418
>>Both?

19:58.460 --> 20:00.900
Liz: Oh, and... one more thing.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.958
What is it?

20:04.000 --> 20:08.478
We keep the windows open in the basement at night.

20:08.520 --> 20:13.318
And it's kind of an old house
so sometimes there's noise.

20:13.360 --> 20:16.528
Liz: I should've mentioned that earlier.

20:16.570 --> 20:19.158
If you scare easily tell me now.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.858
I don't.

20:20.900 --> 20:23.210
Mackenzie: The house isn't haunted or anything, is it?

20:24.210 --> 20:25.940
Peyton thinks it is.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.438
I'll be okay.

20:29.480 --> 20:30.688
Mackenzie: And...

20:30.730 --> 20:33.400
I'll watch what I say around her so I don't scare her.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.958
Thank you.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.258
And there's nothing here that
would hurt her or - any of us.

20:41.300 --> 20:45.048
It just... can be unsettling.

20:45.090 --> 20:49.458
I've dealt with worse than spooky
noises. I got this. Don't worry about it.

20:52.220 --> 20:55.330
Alright. Thank you, Mackenzie. I-

20:58.040 --> 21:00.278
I hope you come back. I have a good feeling about you.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.000
Um. You too.

21:11.630 --> 21:14.098
Goodnight. See you in the morning. >>Goodnight.

21:17.900 --> 21:20.078
Uh, goodnight Mackenzie.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.968
Feel free to call or text me if you need anything.

21:23.010 --> 21:26.278
Though, I will be working so
can't say I'll answer right away.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.430
No problem. Have a great night.

21:47.300 --> 21:50.658
You know this house is haunted, right?

21:50.700 --> 21:52.990
Like, haunted AF.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.278
What? Do you even know what that means?

21:56.320 --> 21:57.608
Language.

22:07.970 --> 22:10.988
Slow down on those chips. Save some room for dinner.

22:11.030 --> 22:14.098
I have plenty of room. I'm starving.

22:14.140 --> 22:16.650
You worked up an appetite flunking this test, huh?

22:19.280 --> 22:21.000
I'm just kidding. You got everything right.

22:22.630 --> 22:23.978
That was mean.

22:24.020 --> 22:27.348
Not as mean as you threatening
my tip. Good work, though.

22:27.390 --> 22:30.900
So, we've got about an hour before
dinner. What do you want to do?

22:31.400 --> 22:34.878
I don't know. That's your job, Ms. Babysitter.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.380
I don't know what you like. What do you have around here?

22:41.080 --> 22:42.168
TV.

22:42.210 --> 22:45.248
It's too early for TV. Don't be a boob.

22:45.290 --> 22:46.778
A boob?

22:46.820 --> 22:49.338
My grandpa calls TV the 'boob tube'.

22:49.380 --> 22:52.428
Cause it turns you into a mindless
boob when you watch it all day.

22:52.470 --> 22:53.968
Like Tik Tok?

22:54.010 --> 22:56.238
Not as bad. But that's correct.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.210
Mackenzie: Well, what do you
do when you have friends over?

23:02.310 --> 23:04.100
I don't have any friends.

23:05.750 --> 23:06.898
What?

23:06.940 --> 23:10.388
We just moved back here a month ago.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.838
We moved to Delaware for a while.

23:12.880 --> 23:15.098
Peyton: Then came back here.

23:15.140 --> 23:17.548
I didn't have any friends there, either.

23:17.590 --> 23:20.968
Everyone thinks I'm weird just like my mom is.

23:21.010 --> 23:23.288
Your mom's sweet.

23:23.330 --> 23:27.628
Come on, she's weird. You don't have to pretend she's not.

23:27.670 --> 23:31.598
Your mom's got anxiety or
something, okay? That's not weird.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.408
Anyone who says it is, is just dumb and mean.

23:34.450 --> 23:38.898
Well, everyone is dumb and mean.
That's why I don't have any friends.

23:38.940 --> 23:40.350
You have one now.

23:41.650 --> 23:43.760
You're getting paid to be here.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.528
Mackenzie: Right. So I could let you sit in
front of the TV all night and turn into a boob.

23:48.570 --> 23:50.228
But I'm not going to let that happen.

23:50.270 --> 23:53.098
Mackenzie: We're going to have fun. Right now.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.638
Like, right this very second.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.438
So put down those chips, turn that frown upside down.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.058
And we're going to have some fun.

24:01.100 --> 24:06.970
♪ bouncy, energetic music ♪

24:07.370 --> 24:09.958
Chocolate Chip.

24:11.670 --> 24:12.958
Challenge.

24:16.090 --> 24:18.078
What?

24:18.120 --> 24:19.230
Yeah!

24:23.030 --> 24:25.410
Mackenzie: Challenge?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.150
Uno.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.160
No.

24:42.860 --> 24:44.758
Done. Uno!

24:44.800 --> 24:46.438
Peyton: Done. Done. Done. Done. Done.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.840
♪ bouncy, energetic music ♪

25:13.920 --> 25:15.850
♪ bouncy, energetic music ♪

25:25.850 --> 25:27.520
♪ bouncy, energetic music ♪

26:50.250 --> 26:53.838
What is wrong with you? You
can't even fit all that in your mouth.

26:53.880 --> 26:58.058
>>After all those
fries and that giant burger, too?

26:58.100 --> 27:00.068
That was two hours ago.

27:00.110 --> 27:03.608
I know, and you'll probably ask
me for dessert before bed, too.

27:03.650 --> 27:05.000
Well, of course.

27:10.140 --> 27:12.328
Can you be my babysitter from now on?

27:12.370 --> 27:14.100
If your mom's a good tipper.

27:15.860 --> 27:17.858
Not only will I be your babysitter.

27:17.900 --> 27:20.870
But I'll ask your mom if I can come
over sometimes and we can hang out.

27:25.390 --> 27:26.958
Can I ask you a question?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.430
M-hm. >>Why did you guys move?

27:32.730 --> 27:34.968
You promise you'll come back if I tell you?

27:35.010 --> 27:36.440
Of course.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.398
I think our old house was haunted.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.388
I don't know by what.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.608
I never saw anything.

27:47.650 --> 27:50.848
But I know my mom did.

27:50.890 --> 27:53.118
She was scared of something.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.968
She started sleeping in my room.

27:56.010 --> 27:58.808
And became really protective.

27:58.850 --> 28:00.500
How did this all start?

28:03.080 --> 28:06.658
When we came home late from her ex-boyfriend's house.

28:06.700 --> 28:10.778
We were driving somewhere in the woods.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.208
On Hurley Pond Road.

28:13.250 --> 28:15.550
I remember seeing a sign when we left.

28:17.250 --> 28:20.900
I was asleep in the backseat, and...

28:51.040 --> 28:53.258
Mom?

28:53.300 --> 28:54.820
Mom?

29:43.320 --> 29:44.560
Mom?

29:48.560 --> 29:49.660
Mom?

30:00.380 --> 30:01.410
Mom?

30:03.210 --> 30:04.480
Mom?

30:10.080 --> 30:11.310
Mom!

30:35.610 --> 30:36.960
Mom?!

31:58.800 --> 31:59.870
Female Demonic Voice: Hey.

32:07.870 --> 32:10.610
Liz: Peyton! Peyton, what are you doing out here?

32:11.610 --> 32:13.198
Where did you go?

32:13.240 --> 32:16.558
I woke up in the car and you were
gone. Why didn't you wake me up?

32:16.600 --> 32:19.068
I - I-I'm sorry, I - I

32:19.110 --> 32:20.738
Peyton, I shouldn't have done that.

32:20.780 --> 32:22.158
Where were you, Mom?

32:22.200 --> 32:23.998
I...

32:24.040 --> 32:26.338
I thought I saw someone who needed help.

32:26.380 --> 32:30.958
I locked you in the car to keep
you safe. I went to look for her, but...

32:31.000 --> 32:33.358
Who - who did you see?

32:33.400 --> 32:37.268
I - it was no one. Or at least no one who needed help.

32:37.310 --> 32:39.378
I - it doesn't matter.

32:39.420 --> 32:44.528
I shouldn't have done that
and I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

32:44.570 --> 32:45.730
Liz: Do you forgive me?

32:48.230 --> 32:50.958
If you get me out of these woods I will.

32:53.150 --> 32:54.400
Deal.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.078
Peyton: She was different after that.

32:59.120 --> 33:01.878
She was scared of something.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.640
And even when she wasn't scared...

33:04.240 --> 33:06.050
She was always...

33:07.050 --> 33:10.490
Somewhere else. Even when she was home.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.100
That doesn't make sense, does it?

33:14.460 --> 33:15.760
I know what you mean.

33:18.260 --> 33:20.638
The house felt different after that.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.818
It was always cold.

33:22.860 --> 33:25.938
And I would hear things.

33:25.980 --> 33:30.138
I'd have night terrors. I'd wake up in other rooms.

33:30.180 --> 33:32.050
Outside once.

33:33.650 --> 33:38.158
I think that's why we moved.
Although she said it was work.

33:38.200 --> 33:41.668
But whatever it was just followed us there.

33:41.710 --> 33:43.690
And followed us back here.

33:45.890 --> 33:48.100
Do you still have the picture that you took?

33:48.850 --> 33:52.468
Yeah. She deleted it from her phone.

33:52.510 --> 33:55.418
But I sent it to my email and printed it out in school.

33:55.460 --> 33:57.210
It's under my mattress.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.500
You sure you're going to come back?

34:24.900 --> 34:26.910
You're scared. I can tell.

34:29.100 --> 34:31.038
How old are you?

34:31.080 --> 34:32.258
Seven.

34:32.300 --> 34:33.398
Mackenzie: I'm fourteen.

34:33.440 --> 34:37.338
If you can go through all of
that and you're okay, I'll be fine.

34:37.380 --> 34:39.800
I think I saw some brownie mix in the cabinet.

34:40.830 --> 34:44.068
You already complained I was eating too much.

34:44.110 --> 34:47.798
And you are but we need a distraction, so - brownies.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.568
Brownies!

35:24.000 --> 35:25.268
Ready?

35:25.310 --> 35:26.610
Yep. Let's go.

35:54.210 --> 35:56.708
I know, Peyton.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.720
I will come get you tomorrow.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.930
I just have to deal with something first.

36:07.230 --> 36:09.410
You're having fun at your
Grandma and Grandpa's aren't you?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.360
I know.

36:16.260 --> 36:19.000
I will come. First thing in the morning.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.200
Yes.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.100
Yes.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.198
I'll be...

36:28.240 --> 36:30.158
I'll be fine.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.660
Okay?

36:32.660 --> 36:34.030
Yeah.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.630
Love you.

37:58.490 --> 37:59.958
Liz.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.688
Haley: Hey are you okay?

38:02.730 --> 38:06.080
Haley: I called for you before I
came in. The door was still open.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.568
I...

38:09.610 --> 38:12.428
I didn't hear you. I'm - I'm sorry.

38:12.470 --> 38:15.808
It's okay, I'm sorry I scared you.

38:15.850 --> 38:19.018
I just - I heard you moved away.

38:19.060 --> 38:21.228
And I didn't see you for three weeks.

38:21.270 --> 38:24.870
Then I saw your car and I - I just...

38:27.870 --> 38:31.018
We moved back.

38:31.060 --> 38:34.600
The other place didn't work out. It's a better deal here.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.258
Sorry, I didn't tell you. It was kind of abrupt.

38:39.300 --> 38:42.548
Yeah. Whatever, it's fine. I was just worried.

38:44.790 --> 38:47.128
Hope I didn't get you in trouble with Rick.

38:47.170 --> 38:50.958
The diner's fine. They filled your shift pretty fast.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.058
Liz: But if you need to go back,
I'm sure he'd talk to you about it.

38:54.100 --> 38:56.968
Honestly, we were all just worried.

38:57.010 --> 38:58.990
Are you okay?

38:59.490 --> 39:01.858
Can I get you some coffee?

39:01.900 --> 39:05.268
That's the least you could do.
You just tried to kill me, so...

39:26.000 --> 39:27.510
Maybe you should sit down.

39:28.410 --> 39:30.138
I can't. I...

39:30.180 --> 39:32.268
I have too much energy. I, I...

39:32.310 --> 39:34.018
I can't stop moving, otherwise...

39:34.060 --> 39:35.400
Otherwise, what?

39:42.990 --> 39:44.800
Why won't you look out the window?

39:48.780 --> 39:50.498
Liz, sit down right now.

39:50.540 --> 39:52.580
I can't Haley.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.540
Liz. Sit.

40:00.340 --> 40:02.738
The coffee's almost ready.

40:02.780 --> 40:06.380
I'll take care of that. The way you're shaking
you'll spill it all over the place, anyway.

40:08.380 --> 40:09.620
Come on.

40:19.020 --> 40:22.238
Liz: I must have fallen asleep at the wheel.

40:22.280 --> 40:27.168
Liz: I don't know, I... I closed my eyes for a second.

40:27.210 --> 40:29.828
Liz: And...

40:29.870 --> 40:31.370
I felt a bump.

40:32.570 --> 40:35.178
And I opened my eyes.

40:35.220 --> 40:39.308
Liz: I... hit the brakes...

40:39.350 --> 40:42.380
Liz: And there was this woman.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.860
Liz: Running into the woods.

40:54.200 --> 40:57.890
Liz: I left Peyton asleep in the
car. I know I shouldn't have, but...

41:01.570 --> 41:04.000
Liz: I got out to check on her, and...

41:45.000 --> 41:47.728
Liz: I couldn't find her but there was...

41:47.770 --> 41:52.238
Liz: This weird shrine and
even though I couldn't find her-

41:52.280 --> 41:56.018
Liz:... I knew I wasn't alone out there.

41:56.060 --> 41:56.990
Liz: Something was like...

41:58.990 --> 42:02.220
Liz: Waiting for me. I could feel it.

42:02.600 --> 42:04.158
Liz: I feel it...

42:04.200 --> 42:06.040
Liz: I feel it even now.

42:08.340 --> 42:13.068
Almost every time I look out a window, I-

42:13.110 --> 42:16.000
There's something out there, or...

42:17.270 --> 42:19.000
...in the room with me.

42:21.310 --> 42:24.788
You really think some entity followed you home?

42:24.830 --> 42:26.840
How else would you explain all this?

42:28.740 --> 42:31.248
Our minds work in mysterious ways.

42:31.290 --> 42:35.098
And you've been through a lot in your life.

42:35.140 --> 42:39.588
You've had to fight to protect
Peyton from very real threats.

42:39.630 --> 42:44.310
And so - I think whatever happened exacerbated that.

42:45.310 --> 42:48.968
And is playing on it in a surreal way.

42:49.010 --> 42:51.988
Through... nightmares.

42:52.030 --> 42:55.708
And maybe... hallucinations.

42:55.750 --> 42:57.928
What about Peyton's night terrors?

42:57.970 --> 43:01.548
How does my anxiety explain her
getting up in the middle of the night.

43:01.590 --> 43:03.270
And me having to find her out in the f-

43:06.270 --> 43:08.668
Out in the woods behind our home.

43:08.710 --> 43:12.818
In the closet or >>She can
sense what you're going through.

43:12.860 --> 43:16.028
Kids pick up on a lot more than you think.

43:16.070 --> 43:19.748
And just like with her Dad's...

43:19.790 --> 43:21.998
...drinking problems.

43:22.040 --> 43:24.268
It can affect her subconsciously.

43:24.310 --> 43:27.140
And come out in all sorts of behaviors.

43:28.740 --> 43:30.710
Haley: I think you ought to talk to someone.

43:32.310 --> 43:35.128
Maybe take something that...

43:35.170 --> 43:38.598
...can help you.

43:38.640 --> 43:41.800
I can get you into my doctor's
office for a free consult.

43:44.160 --> 43:46.380
What else can you do?

43:50.080 --> 43:53.548
Running away obviously didn't help.

43:53.590 --> 43:56.348
I think I have to...

43:56.390 --> 43:59.408
Confront her. Or.

43:59.450 --> 44:01.418
It.

44:01.460 --> 44:03.218
Find out what it wants.

44:03.260 --> 44:06.200
And you think it wants Peyton. >>I know it does.

44:06.700 --> 44:08.038
But...

44:08.080 --> 44:09.958
There has to be something else I can do.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.028
Yeah, and I just gave you the best option.

44:12.070 --> 44:15.628
Do you want to get professional help
or do you want to go into the woods to...

44:15.670 --> 44:18.108
...confront some entity?

44:18.150 --> 44:20.580
I want to protect Peyton.

44:37.300 --> 44:39.848
Peyton: I think evil spirits can be real.

44:39.890 --> 44:41.738
But if they are, then God's real.

44:41.780 --> 44:44.178
I know your mom doesn't believe in that, but...

44:44.220 --> 44:47.018
I don't think she does. But I do.

44:47.060 --> 44:51.058
Mackenzie: Well, good. And if He's
real He's more powerful than any spirit.

44:51.100 --> 44:53.168
No matter how scary they are.

44:53.210 --> 44:57.758
Sometimes, when I get scared,
like, of something like a spirit.

44:57.800 --> 45:01.430
Or like the time my house got
robbed when I was 10, I'd read this.

45:02.130 --> 45:05.108
"He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High,

45:05.150 --> 45:08.388
"Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

45:08.430 --> 45:12.168
"I will say of the Lord, 'He is my refuge and my fortress.

45:12.210 --> 45:14.478
"'My God, in Him I will trust.'

45:14.520 --> 45:19.278
"Surely He shall deliver you from
the snare," the trap, "of the fowler."

45:19.320 --> 45:21.130
So, like a bird trapper.

45:21.230 --> 45:24.218
Peyton: Why would a bird trapper be after me?

45:24.260 --> 45:27.598
Well, it's used more... like...

45:27.640 --> 45:29.638
It's just an example. I get it.

45:31.130 --> 45:34.158
Continue. >>Mackenzie: "And
from the perilous pestilence."

45:34.200 --> 45:37.078
Mackenzie: So, like a disease. >>Like Coronavirus?

45:37.120 --> 45:38.078
Yep.

45:38.120 --> 45:42.058
"He shall cover you with His feathers
and under His wings you shall take refuge.

45:42.100 --> 45:44.428
"His truth shall be your shield and buckler.

45:44.470 --> 45:49.208
"You shall not be afraid of the terror by
night, nor of the arrow that flies by day.

45:49.250 --> 45:52.248
"Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness.

45:52.290 --> 45:55.748
"Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.

45:55.790 --> 45:59.778
"A thousand may fall at your
side and 10,000 at your right hand.

45:59.820 --> 46:03.388
"But it shall not come near you.
Only with your eyes shall you look,

46:03.430 --> 46:05.468
"And see the reward of the wicked.

46:05.510 --> 46:09.258
"Because you have made the Lord,
who is my refuge, even the Most High-

46:09.300 --> 46:12.238
"Your dwelling place. No evil shall befall you.

46:12.280 --> 46:14.718
"Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling.

46:14.760 --> 46:19.178
Mackenzie: "For He shall give His angels
charge over you, to keep you in all your ways."

51:26.140 --> 51:27.348
Aedan: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

51:27.390 --> 51:29.478
Aedan: I... I didn't mean to scare you.

51:29.520 --> 51:33.430
Do - do you have a phone? Is this - Is this your home?

51:36.230 --> 51:39.780
Do you... do you even know where we are?

51:41.780 --> 51:43.858
Will you say something?

51:43.900 --> 51:47.030
I have to go. She's - she's coming back. I'll call for help.

51:48.030 --> 51:50.370
Come on, you got to at least untie me.

51:57.090 --> 51:58.928
She's coming back. Hide.

52:23.340 --> 52:25.260
Listen. Listen.

52:27.260 --> 52:29.998
I had two more stops left after my last.

52:30.040 --> 52:32.100
Aedan: People are going to be looking for me.

52:34.900 --> 52:37.390
Did you hear me?! People are going to be looking for me!

55:14.230 --> 55:15.758
You okay?

55:15.800 --> 55:19.058
Yeah. I... I was reading to her-

55:19.100 --> 55:23.068
Mackenzie: -and I fell asleep.
Sorry I didn't mean to sleep in here.

55:23.110 --> 55:25.028
I'm surprised she didn't ask you to.

55:25.070 --> 55:29.058
She did. Um, I told her I would stay till she fell asleep.

55:29.100 --> 55:31.758
You guys got along that well, huh?

55:31.800 --> 55:34.460
Yeah. She's... she's special.

55:36.260 --> 55:37.360
She is.

55:38.260 --> 55:40.328
You decide where you want to sleep?

55:40.370 --> 55:43.190
Can I sleep in here? On the floor.

55:44.390 --> 55:47.898
On the floor? You've got a bed and a couch.

55:47.940 --> 55:50.200
Yeah, I know. But...

55:52.460 --> 55:53.740
Whatever you want.

55:54.440 --> 55:56.138
Thank you.

55:56.180 --> 55:58.000
Let me get you some extra blankets and a pillow.

56:50.050 --> 56:51.500
Rise and shine!

56:56.290 --> 56:57.970
Good morning, Peyton.

57:02.770 --> 57:04.480
Let's go get breakfast.

57:36.700 --> 57:39.248
Come in.

57:39.290 --> 57:41.268
Hey.

57:41.310 --> 57:42.768
Did you hear the news?

57:42.810 --> 57:44.008
What news?

57:44.050 --> 57:46.748
You may have not been dreaming last week after all.

57:46.790 --> 57:48.418
No way.

57:48.460 --> 57:52.638
'Aedan Cooley's Honda CRV was
discovered by a jogger this morning.

57:52.680 --> 57:55.508
'Parked down a path leading to the Wheaton River.'

57:55.550 --> 57:57.888
But they didn't find him?

57:57.930 --> 58:01.958
No. It says they're waiting on forensics
but there's no immediate signs of foul play.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.578
He made the rest of his deliveries that night.

58:04.620 --> 58:06.678
Maybe she followed him.

58:06.720 --> 58:09.508
You said he didn't make it
back till almost midnight, right?

58:09.550 --> 58:12.738
But if she was going to kill him there, why would she?

58:12.780 --> 58:15.548
To cover her tracks, obviously.

58:15.590 --> 58:19.138
She might've made those last two deliveries.

58:19.180 --> 58:23.868
It just doesn't make sense, Cammy.
This is all weird I know, but it's...

58:23.910 --> 58:26.528
...less weird to think of it like it was a dream.

58:26.570 --> 58:30.500
But if it wasn't Peyton could be in danger. And her mom.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.688
Maybe you should talk to Liz.

58:33.730 --> 58:36.920
I was thinking of going over there, anyways. So, maybe.

58:38.220 --> 58:40.510
Just make sure you babysit here from now on.

58:43.100 --> 58:44.320
What are you working on?

58:45.620 --> 58:49.078
The book that Peyton took a picture of. It was in Hindi.

58:49.120 --> 58:53.168
I was able to translate some
of it. It's about Anna Kuari.

58:53.210 --> 58:58.738
Mackenzie: 'A Hindu goddess that requires human
sacrifice to bless the harvest of her worshipers.'

58:58.780 --> 59:03.040
If there was a demon in that
cornfield she might have been it.

59:06.140 --> 59:08.860
What road did Peyton say that happened on?

59:09.160 --> 59:10.940
Um. Hurley Pond.

59:11.340 --> 59:13.560
What do you think Liz saw out there?

59:30.000 --> 59:32.698
That's, um.

59:32.740 --> 59:35.308
That's a disturbing dream.

59:35.350 --> 59:36.348
Mackenzie: Uh...

59:36.390 --> 59:39.988
Peyton told me a little bit about
what you guys went through.

59:40.030 --> 59:41.988
With moving or...

59:42.030 --> 59:44.768
Mackenzie: Whatever happened
on the road before you moved.

59:44.810 --> 59:48.388
The creepy things going on around the house.

59:48.430 --> 59:50.948
I told her not to bring that up.

59:50.990 --> 59:53.738
I asked and she was scared.

59:53.780 --> 59:56.288
I'm sorry, but I only bring it up...

59:56.330 --> 59:59.628
So I can make sure that you're not in any danger.

59:59.670 --> 01:00:00.870
Either of you.

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:02.400
Hm.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:09.280
Do you think something or
someone, maybe, followed you home?

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.838
I think that Peyton had a
terrifying experience that night-

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.938
that I made a very poor parenting decision-

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.958
Liz: -to leave her alone in the car.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.958
Liz: I think that night has
had some lasting repercussions.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.368
Maybe for both of us.

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:31.508
And you think that my dream was just a... crazy... dream?

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:34.158
With everything that Peyton told you-

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.158
and how creaky and creepy this house is.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.000
Liz: Absolutely.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.948
Liz: Trust me. I'd do anything to protect Peyton.

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:45.290
If I thought there was
something going on I'd handle it.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.870
You've been in the basement?

01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:51.348
Every day.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:54.998
I put a padlock on the door outside.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.330
The day after you were here.
Been meaning to do that for a while.

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:03.000
Want to look for yourself?

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:06.540
Oh, no. That's not necessary.

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.000
You sure?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.338
Mackenzie!

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:13.028
Peyton: I missed you!

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:16.798
I missed you, too. I told you it
wasn't all about the money, didn't I?

01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:23.698
Peyton: I didn't believe you.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.470
I didn't think you'd ever come back.

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:33.680
Hey, we're friends. I'm not going anywhere.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.658
Want to help me with some homework?

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.500
Peyton. Don't bother her with your work.

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.218
I don't mind.

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:47.740
Please? Can she?

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.678
Liz: She just came here to talk.
I don't know how long she has-

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.248
Liz: -until her parents expect her back.

01:02:55.250 --> 01:03:01.188
It's up to her.

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:03.000
I'm good. I've got time.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.590
I'll make something for lunch, then.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.300
Sounds great.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.500
Where are you?

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.560
Where are you?!

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.340
I'm tired of it.

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.690
You chased us out of our home.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.198
Liz: You followed us to Delaware and back.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.718
Liz: I don't remember the last
time I slept through the night.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.848
I don't remember the last time
my little girl slept through the night.

01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:35.478
Without waking up screaming.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.218
Or worse.

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.430
Liz: And it's because of you.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.118
So what do you want?

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.598
Why are you doing this to us?

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.268
Is it because I got out of my car that night?

01:05:52.310 --> 01:05:54.300
Because I tried to help.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.000
Liz: I thought I was helping someone.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.640
I didn't know what you were.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.238
But I do now.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.840
And this is ending tonight!

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.470
You're not going to keep putting Peyton through this.

01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:19.300
She's gone through enough in life - she does not need it!

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.828
Liz: So, whatever you want -

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:25.598
Keep her out of it!

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.500
You want blood? Take it from me.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.490
Do you hear me? Take it from me!

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.748
I heard you screaming from the
road. I almost called the police.

01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:51.460
Anyone else would have.

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:06.590
Haley: You need help. For your sake, for Peyton's.

01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:10.400
But I don't want to make that choice for you.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.158
Unless I have to.

01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:22.268
Haley: I know it's not my business
but whatever made you come out here?

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:25.738
And - after what happened in the bathroom
I'm worried you're a danger to yourself.

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.640
And... and others.

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.000
Peyton.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.390
Liz. Let me help you.

01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:00.700
Okay.

01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:40.548
Hey, Mac?

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:41.808
Hm?

01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:43.118
Did you hear me?

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.898
No, I'm sorry. What did you say?

01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:47.878
Peyton: I've been reading the psalm-

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.618
Every night since you read it to me.

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:52.210
I haven't had any nightmares since then.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.400
That's a start.
