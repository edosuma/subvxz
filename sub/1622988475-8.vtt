NARRATOR:
Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:06.963 --> 00:08.617
Oh, you're gonna
try to pin this on me?

00:08.660 --> 00:11.750
-All I know is I didn't do it.
-Well, neither did I.

00:11.794 --> 00:14.014
-Do you know the lady
who lives here?
-Mrs. Yost!

00:14.057 --> 00:15.189
When was the last time
you saw her?

00:15.232 --> 00:17.060
ALMA:
Two days ago.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.193
She was taking a trip up north
to visit her sister.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.934
CATHERINE:
And I'm sure Rita's been
cheating on him this whole time.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.066
Any idea who with?

00:23.110 --> 00:24.502
But once I find out,

00:24.546 --> 00:26.765
I'll make Rita
and her gigolo very sorry.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.071
[weak chuckle]

00:28.115 --> 00:30.291
I did not kill Carlo.

00:30.334 --> 00:31.683
I'm gonna take your case.

00:31.727 --> 00:32.858
But we have to
think about our future

00:32.902 --> 00:34.904
-and the baby.
-Baby?!

00:34.947 --> 00:36.949
-Oh, boy.
-I plan to nominate you again.

00:36.993 --> 00:40.040
If you still want to be a part
of our silly club.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.476
I do.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.391
I'm gonna be all by myself
in this cold,

00:43.434 --> 00:46.002
-empty house.
-I sure wouldn't want you
to be lonely.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.831
BERTRAM:
Why a man is dead and his wife
is in jail for murder--

00:48.874 --> 00:50.441
all so you could
get into a garden club.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.182
We're about to be grandparents.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.576
Let's just put all this
unpleasantness behind us.

00:54.619 --> 00:58.580
ISABEL:
I just decided to stay in town
a couple more days. Promising

00:58.623 --> 01:01.931
business opportunity
has just presented itself.

01:07.763 --> 01:11.288
NARRATOR:
Rita Castillo had always
thought of herself as a woman

01:11.332 --> 01:14.596
who would do anything
to survive.

01:14.639 --> 01:18.034
And she had the rap sheet
to prove it.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.471
She'd stolen money.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.995
She'd sold her body.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.998
She even helped to kill a man.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.696
But she was now in jail

01:27.739 --> 01:30.568
for a crime she didn't commit.

01:30.612 --> 01:34.137
And no one believed
a woman like her

01:34.181 --> 01:36.096
could be innocent.

01:37.575 --> 01:40.012
They're calling me
a black widow?

01:40.056 --> 01:41.840
That's one
of the nicer headlines.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.539
Is this your way of telling me
you won't take my case?

01:44.582 --> 01:46.149
With publicity like this?

01:46.193 --> 01:48.891
You bet I'll take it.
And I'll win it, too.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.633
Good, because I did not
kill my husband.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.069
And that's the truth.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.158
Murder trials
aren't about the truth.

01:55.202 --> 01:59.031
They're about stories.
And the D.A.'S got a juicy one.

01:59.075 --> 02:00.903
Rich guy ends up dead.

02:00.946 --> 02:03.645
His cheating wife is caught
with poison in her purse.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.690
Mm.
You got a better one?

02:05.734 --> 02:06.822
I was framed.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.215
Is that the best you can do?

02:08.258 --> 02:09.477
It's what happened.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.261
Someone put that syringe
in my bag.

02:11.305 --> 02:14.003
But who? And don't say his
daughter-- she's got an alibi.

02:14.046 --> 02:16.136
Who else was home that night?

02:16.179 --> 02:18.181
Just my cousin, Isabel.

02:18.225 --> 02:20.749
Who also happens
to work as my maid.

02:21.750 --> 02:22.925
Hello.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.927
There's our killer.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.147
-What?
-Yeah, this is good.
This is good.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.932
She, uh, she framed you
because she hates your guts.

02:29.975 --> 02:32.326
What? Please.
Isabel loves me.

02:32.369 --> 02:33.631
No, no, no, no, she used to,

02:33.675 --> 02:35.067
but, uh, she's gotten jealous

02:35.111 --> 02:36.634
of your looks, your money...

02:36.678 --> 02:39.071
You had everything.
She had bupkis.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.638
She wanted you to suffer.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.424
And you really think
a jury would buy that?

02:43.467 --> 02:45.121
Well, it's worth a shot.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.211
Here. I need you to answer
these questions for me.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.779
If we're gonna pin this
on Isabel, I'm gonna need

02:50.822 --> 02:53.477
every bit of dirt on her
that you can shovel.

02:53.521 --> 02:56.219
This is just a strategy
to get me out of jail, right?

02:56.263 --> 02:57.220
Of course.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.700
But if people believe this,

02:58.743 --> 03:00.484
isn't there a chance
Isabel could be arrested

03:00.528 --> 03:01.703
for Carlo's murder?

03:03.400 --> 03:05.533
That's a good question.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.578
I got a better one.

03:07.622 --> 03:10.494
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life in prison?

03:12.148 --> 03:15.238
NARRATOR:
Yes, Rita Castillo had
always thought of herself

03:15.282 --> 03:19.024
as a woman who would
do anything to survive.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.725
She was now about to find out...

03:25.553 --> 03:28.817
...if that was true.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.864
â™ª

03:51.927 --> 03:54.756
NARRATOR: Alma Fillcot
walked into her garden that day

03:54.799 --> 03:57.411
hoping to prune her roses.

03:57.454 --> 03:59.326
But before she began,

03:59.369 --> 04:02.677
Alma decided to have a chat

04:02.720 --> 04:05.114
with an old friend.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.203
Mrs. Yost.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.727
How are you this fine morning?

04:09.771 --> 04:11.163
Still dead?

04:11.207 --> 04:12.817
Pity.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.559
If you were here,
you'd see how good I'm looking.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.953
It's not because
of any mascara or rouge.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.041
No, ma'am.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.173
I have learned firsthand

04:21.217 --> 04:24.089
that crushing one's enemies
is the best cosmetic.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.092
What do you say to that?

04:28.006 --> 04:29.660
Alma?

04:31.619 --> 04:33.490
Oh! [laughs] Grace.

04:33.534 --> 04:34.839
-You scared me. [chuckles]
-Oh.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.319
Sorry.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.495
I was going to call,
but I thought,

04:38.539 --> 04:40.976
"No, I want to see her face
when I tell her."

04:41.977 --> 04:42.978
Tell me what?

04:43.021 --> 04:44.632
I spoke to the girls last night.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.198
We all agreed.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.592
Rita is out of the Garden Club
and you're in.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.420
Ah! Oh.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.117
-I'm so happy.
-Oh, me too.

04:52.161 --> 04:54.032
Will there be a luncheon
like before?

04:54.076 --> 04:55.860
-This Friday.
-Oh.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.732
Oh, but I won't be able to come.
I have a wedding out of town.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.864
You have to be
at my first meeting.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.431
I'm only in because of you.

05:01.475 --> 05:02.476
I wish I could.

05:02.519 --> 05:03.999
Are you free tonight?

05:04.042 --> 05:06.175
The ladies could come here,
just for an hour.

05:06.218 --> 05:10.092
-Well, I suppose a little
celebration is in order.
-[giggles]

05:10.135 --> 05:12.181
Excellent.
Uh, shall we say 6:00?

05:12.224 --> 05:13.661
I will rally the troops.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.358
-[laughs]
-Oh!

05:15.402 --> 05:16.925
Bye.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.453
Did you hear that, Mrs. Yost?

05:23.497 --> 05:25.412
I'm in the Garden Club.

05:25.455 --> 05:28.589
The club you said
would never have me as a member.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.853
Have fun turning in your grave.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.467
Good morning, baby.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.991
Oh, Scooter.
How handsome you look.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.778
And another smooch
for my snazzy new robe.

05:43.821 --> 05:47.216
Well, I gladly take the kiss,
but the robe is not from me.

05:47.259 --> 05:50.045
Come on. It just magically
appeared at the foot of my bed?

05:51.829 --> 05:53.701
Is the robe to your liking, sir?

05:53.744 --> 05:55.224
Yeah.

05:55.267 --> 05:57.182
But if it's from you
I'm paying in handshakes.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.707
This is Otto,
my butler from Texas.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.056
He's agreed to work for me here.

06:01.099 --> 06:02.884
Oh, a real butler, huh?

06:02.927 --> 06:06.104
With a name like Otto, maybe you
should have been a chauffeur.

06:06.148 --> 06:08.237
I bet you hear that one a lot.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.544
Thankfully, no.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.764
Don't tease Otto.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.419
He's German.
It'll end badly.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.029
So, what do you want
to do today--

06:18.073 --> 06:20.554
uh, have a swim,
catch a movie?

06:20.597 --> 06:22.947
I can't. I'm busy
going through Rita's records.

06:22.991 --> 06:26.124
I need to prove
she had a lover here in LA.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.563
Who cares
if she had a boyfriend?

06:29.606 --> 06:31.216
The district attorney.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.654
He says evidence of an affair

06:33.697 --> 06:36.526
will help convict her
of Papa's murder.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.659
Haven't you been through
enough all ready

06:38.702 --> 06:40.704
without doing
the D.A.'s job for him?

06:40.748 --> 06:42.184
You need to relax.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.925
I-I say skip the trial.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.317
Get out of town.

06:45.361 --> 06:47.494
We'll go to Rome
or somewhere in Europe.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.496
Mm.
Nothing would please me more

06:49.539 --> 06:51.236
than to take a little trip
with you.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.457
But don't worry,
this won't take long.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.462
You'll be packing your bags
before you know it.

07:07.296 --> 07:08.428
ALMA:
Bertram.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.299
There you are.

07:10.342 --> 07:11.735
I have wonderful news.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.215
It's official.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.435
I've been accepted
into the Garden Club.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.567
Mm.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.138
The ladies are coming over
this evening

07:23.181 --> 07:24.661
to help me celebrate.

07:24.705 --> 07:27.142
I'm going up to the attic
to get my punch bowl.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.884
If you don't mind, I could use
your help with the cups.

07:32.277 --> 07:33.365
Bertram.

07:33.409 --> 07:36.020
I've been thinking about Rita,

07:36.064 --> 07:38.545
and her little cat.
[chuckles]: Aw.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.068
She loves him so much.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.504
Of course she loves him.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.245
They're the same species.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.769
She may be tried
for a crime we committed.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.205
Don't you care at all?

07:47.249 --> 07:49.251
Let's say that I do.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.774
Do you want me to confess?

07:50.818 --> 07:53.168
Would you be happier
if we both went to jail?

07:53.211 --> 07:54.604
At least we'd deserve it.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.563
Oh, what a thing to say.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.695
Actions have consequences.

07:58.739 --> 08:01.176
Well, you weren't keen to face
any when you were filling up

08:01.219 --> 08:03.744
graveyards
with your previous victims.

08:03.787 --> 08:06.703
My fondest dream
is finally coming true.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.792
If you can't share in my joy,

08:08.836 --> 08:10.664
at least try not to ruin it.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.807
-[whines]
-Rocco,

08:23.851 --> 08:25.635
do you see how pretty
Mom's garden is?

08:25.679 --> 08:27.245
[barks]

08:27.289 --> 08:28.682
Oh, right.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.510
It's just one big toilet to you.

08:30.553 --> 08:33.077
-MAN: When does he get here?
-ROHBIN: Could be soon.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.862
Might have to wait a while.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.341
Hey.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.430
Don't I know you?

08:38.474 --> 08:40.041
Sure.

08:40.084 --> 08:42.043
-You're Vern's girl, right?
-Yeah.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.306
Dee.
Uh, Detective Rohbin?

08:44.349 --> 08:46.482
Yeah.
What are you doing here?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.701
I live here.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.006
Why are you here?

08:49.050 --> 08:50.486
You know the owner
of that house?

08:50.530 --> 08:51.792
Mrs. Yost?
Sure.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.402
We're meeting her nephew
in a few minutes.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.622
He's helping us investigate
her disappearance.

08:56.623 --> 08:57.711
Disappearance?

08:57.754 --> 08:59.756
No, she's just away on a trip.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.759
She asked my mom to look after
her dog while she's gone.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.369
I'm sorry to tell you, Dee.

09:04.413 --> 09:07.155
Her car was found
submerged in a lake up north.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.765
What?

09:08.809 --> 09:10.288
Yeah.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.986
We suspect foul play.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.077
â™ª

09:19.646 --> 09:21.343
I'm sorry.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.388
What did you just say?

09:23.432 --> 09:26.609
I said I got proof
Rita didn't kill Carlo.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.220
-What is it?
-Not so fast.

09:29.264 --> 09:32.223
You tell Rita
it's gonna cost her 20 Gs.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.616
I need to be compensated

09:33.660 --> 09:35.662
for the way she treated me
all these years.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.011
I'm not telling her nothing

09:37.054 --> 09:38.882
until I see what you got
with my own eyes.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.362
You already had your chance.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.972
My advice?

09:42.016 --> 09:44.584
Pay more attention
next time you aim your Kodak.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.239
-What?
-You got a week
to come up with the money.

09:48.283 --> 09:49.458
This is where I'm staying.

09:49.501 --> 09:50.677
Isabel.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.330
Tell me what you have.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.941
Not yet.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.291
I've waited a long time
for my ship to come in,

09:56.334 --> 09:58.554
and I'm not gonna
miss it this time.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.823
-Mom.
-Hmm?

10:06.867 --> 10:08.956
When Mrs. Yost asked you
to look after Rocco,

10:08.999 --> 10:10.479
where did she say she was going?

10:12.133 --> 10:15.832
Uh, she said she was paying
a surprise visit to her sister.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.355
Why?

10:17.399 --> 10:18.966
Apparently, she never got there.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.707
The police say she's missing.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.578
Oh, yes.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.407
You know, uh, they
did mention that. [chuckles]

10:25.450 --> 10:26.974
You spoke to the police?

10:27.017 --> 10:28.410
When?

10:28.453 --> 10:31.108
Uh, a detective stopped by,
weeks ago,

10:31.152 --> 10:33.197
asking all sorts of questions.

10:33.241 --> 10:34.677
Why didn't you tell me?

10:34.721 --> 10:37.332
Well, I was busy
getting ready to host a party.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.247
It just slipped my mind.

10:39.290 --> 10:42.250
Well, the cops are starting
to think Mrs. Yost was murdered.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.471
Why?

10:46.515 --> 10:47.821
Did they find her body?

10:47.864 --> 10:49.126
No.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.650
But they found her car
in a lake.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.129
Oh.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.653
Well...

10:53.696 --> 10:55.785
Sounds to me like
they are jumping to conclusions.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.179
Now, how does this look?

10:58.222 --> 11:00.355
How can you be so calm?

11:00.398 --> 11:02.618
Well, we don't know
what's happened.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.795
Besides,
I'm in too good a mood to fret.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.493
I've finally been accepted
into the Garden Club.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.931
Some of the ladies
are coming by this evening

11:10.974 --> 11:12.149
to help me celebrate.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.281
Oh.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.761
-Congratulations.
-Hmm.

11:14.804 --> 11:17.502
Well, it's not just a victory
for me, Deirdre.

11:17.546 --> 11:20.114
Once I'm settled
and I have some sway

11:20.157 --> 11:22.812
with the membership committee,
I'll get you in as well.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.641
-Mom, I'm-I'm getting married.
-Hmm.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.121
I have a baby on the way.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.166
I'm not gonna have time
for a silly club.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.690
Remember...

11:30.733 --> 11:32.082
Babies grow up

11:32.126 --> 11:34.345
and men work late.

11:34.389 --> 11:37.305
Before you know it,
your life will seem very drab.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.743
And you'll yearn
for glamorous friends

11:40.787 --> 11:42.876
to give your days
a bit of color.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.531
Just don't wait too long
to find them.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.403
The years fly by.

11:48.446 --> 11:51.885
And the next thing you know,
you'll be cold in your grave.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.236
Like poor Mrs. Yost.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.370
Assuming she's dead.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.330
Which I'm sure she's not.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.641
ALMA:
All right, and for Grace.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.122
-Mm. Delicious.
-[laughing]

12:12.166 --> 12:13.558
Oh, yum. Yum. Yum

12:13.602 --> 12:14.777
-All right...
-Wonderful.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.474
Ladies, a toast.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.694
To our club's newest member...

12:18.738 --> 12:21.001
-Oh.
-Alma Fillcot.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.654
-Cheers!
-To Alma.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.831
Thank you all so much.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.136
Oh, don't thank us.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.443
Thank Rita
and her handy hypodermic.

12:28.486 --> 12:31.446
Now, now. Rita is innocent
till proven guilty.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.317
Is she sweet
until proven bitchy?

12:33.361 --> 12:36.016
-'Cause I want to serve
on that jury.
-ALMA: Oh, Joan.

12:37.974 --> 12:41.021
Alma, perhaps you'd like
to say a few words?

12:41.064 --> 12:43.327
Oh, no. I-I couldn't possibly.
I...

12:43.371 --> 12:45.112
-Oh, you must.
-Oh, please.

12:45.155 --> 12:48.376
-Yeah. You must.
-I suppose if tradition
demands it. I...

12:48.419 --> 12:49.551
-Yes.
-Speech, speech.
-Oh, wonderful.

12:49.594 --> 12:50.770
-Speech. Speech.
-Yes. Speech.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.641
[clears throat]

13:00.954 --> 13:04.087
These are trying times
for us all.

13:05.088 --> 13:08.875
Our Garden Club's
rosy reputation has been pierced

13:08.918 --> 13:11.486
by thorns of scandal.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.358
But when I look out

13:14.402 --> 13:16.534
at all your smiling faces, my...

13:16.578 --> 13:18.710
-[doorbell rings]
-Oh, for goodness' sake.

13:19.668 --> 13:20.887
Ladies.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.150
Please excuse me.
[chuckles]

13:24.368 --> 13:25.587
Mrs. Fillcot?

13:25.630 --> 13:26.849
I'm Isabel.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.677
I used to work
for Rita Castillo.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.245
It's urgent that I speak to you.
May I come in?

13:31.288 --> 13:34.074
If you're looking for a new job,
you've come at a bad time.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.815
I'm hosting
the Garden Club ladies.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.861
-Then it's a good time.
-Oh, uh, um...

13:38.905 --> 13:41.733
I-I... I can't let you
bother my guests.

13:41.777 --> 13:44.040
I'm not here about a job.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.868
What's this?

13:45.912 --> 13:48.566
This was taken at Rita's house
the night Carlo was killed.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.395
That's Catherine.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.658
That's Scooter.

13:53.702 --> 13:54.790
And that's...

13:54.834 --> 13:56.357
you.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.665
Now can I come in?

14:08.804 --> 14:10.240
-[laughter]
-Joan.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.894
I'll be with you in a moment,
ladies.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.897
I just have to attend
to a domestic issue.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.333
Yes...

14:16.377 --> 14:18.074
Where did you get that?

14:18.118 --> 14:20.729
Rita got a guy to get a photo
of Catherine having sex

14:20.772 --> 14:22.557
so she could blackmail her.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.472
Now I'll use it
to blackmail you.

14:24.515 --> 14:25.777
Isn't life funny?

14:25.821 --> 14:27.997
I don't know why you're so smug.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.433
That photo proves nothing.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.131
It proves you were there.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.872
You killed Carlo

14:32.915 --> 14:34.874
and put the needle
in Rita's purse.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.833
And now you'll have to pay me
to keep quiet.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.922
Everything you just said
is a lie.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.620
But how much money
are we talking?

14:42.664 --> 14:43.926
$20,000.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.886
-20,000?!
-In cash.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.931
Bring it to this hotel
tomorrow night

14:48.975 --> 14:50.802
or I'll go to the cops.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.675
This was supposed
to be my lovely night.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.242
And you've spoiled it.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.244
Yeah, I'm awful.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.941
Picking on a nice lady

14:58.985 --> 15:01.335
just 'cause she killed a man
and framed my boss.

15:01.378 --> 15:03.598
Uh, please go out the back way.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.035
Lady...

15:06.079 --> 15:08.385
Talk to me
like I'm the help one more time

15:08.429 --> 15:11.127
and I'll destroy you
just for the hell of it.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.653
Oh.

15:20.745 --> 15:21.964
Scooter.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.792
Come upstairs.
I need you.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.359
What's going on?

15:25.402 --> 15:27.274
I'm searching the house.
I need to find something

15:27.317 --> 15:29.015
that will prove
that Rita had a lover.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.407
But you looked after breakfast.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.931
You said
you didn't find anything.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.846
I remembered something.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.153
Papa was convinced that Rita
had a hiding place

15:37.197 --> 15:39.373
where she kept things from him.

15:39.416 --> 15:42.767
I'm gonna find it, even if I
have to take this house apart.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.421
Let me just fix myself a drink,

15:44.465 --> 15:46.119
and I'll be right up
to help you.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.381
Don't take too long.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.681
Madame, could this be something?

16:26.724 --> 16:28.335
Oh, that's Rita's account book.

16:28.378 --> 16:29.684
I've already been through that.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.207
According to this,

16:31.251 --> 16:33.557
she was renting some apartment
in Chinatown.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.429
Yes, I've been there once.

16:35.472 --> 16:38.432
I tried to catch her red-handed
but the apartment was empty.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.782
She must have
moved her lover out.

16:40.825 --> 16:43.785
Would you go downstairs
and see what's keeping Scooter?

16:43.828 --> 16:45.569
Of course.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.099
Mr. Scooter.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.491
Miss Catherine is wondering

16:54.535 --> 16:56.363
when you might
join her upstairs.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.017
Going right now.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.670
I was just enjoying the fire.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.125
â™ª

17:35.315 --> 17:37.578
Oh. Izzy, we can't take
the silver candlesticks.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.058
They belonged to Harry's mother.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.277
This is what he gets
for slapping you around.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.366
We'll hock 'em
once we get to El Paso.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.846
Now, come on.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.152
Here, you take that.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.501
-I'll take the small one.
-RITA: Okay.

17:48.545 --> 17:49.894
What's this?

17:49.938 --> 17:51.070
[gasps]

17:51.113 --> 17:52.810
Harry.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.769
I thought you were at work.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.555
You going somewhere?

18:00.253 --> 18:02.211
Mama called.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.473
She's very sick.

18:03.517 --> 18:04.866
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

18:04.909 --> 18:05.867
It's serious.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.304
I left you a note.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.526
See...

18:12.569 --> 18:14.354
I think
you're trying to leave me.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.660
She's in a hospital.
I swear.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.619
I'm so sick of all your lies!

18:18.662 --> 18:19.663
-Ow!
-Let her go!

18:19.707 --> 18:21.839
-Shut up!
-Please!

18:21.883 --> 18:23.319
Please don't hurt her!

18:23.363 --> 18:25.016
I'll stay.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.714
If that's what you want.

18:26.757 --> 18:30.021
What did I say I'd do to you
if this happened again?

18:30.065 --> 18:31.414
Hmm?

18:31.458 --> 18:33.677
What did I say?!

18:33.721 --> 18:35.288
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

18:36.724 --> 18:38.726
You ugly bitch.

18:42.338 --> 18:43.687
Is he dead?

18:43.731 --> 18:45.863
He called me ugly.
Who cares?

18:45.907 --> 18:47.126
Come on.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.143
$20,000?

19:04.186 --> 19:05.405
That's what Isabel said.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.320
And she wants it
by tomorrow night.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.191
We'll obviously have to pay it.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.845
I'll go to the bank
in the morning

19:10.888 --> 19:12.020
and empty our savings account.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.761
We barely have 10,000.

19:13.804 --> 19:16.067
Then I'll have to get
a second mortgage or something.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.634
Do you think
she'd give us more time?

19:17.678 --> 19:20.289
I think she'd prefer
not to negotiate.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.683
[groans]
This is all your fault.

19:22.726 --> 19:25.773
I told you,
actions have consequences.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.949
And now here we are,
swimming in the foul swamp

19:27.992 --> 19:29.168
that you have dug for us.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.170
You know...

19:31.213 --> 19:34.173
We could handle the situation...

19:34.216 --> 19:35.435
permanently.

19:36.479 --> 19:37.959
No!

19:38.002 --> 19:39.395
Well, if actions
have consequences,

19:39.439 --> 19:41.441
shouldn't that apply
to Isabel too?

19:41.484 --> 19:43.007
For the love of God, just stop.

19:43.051 --> 19:44.313
If we pay her,

19:44.357 --> 19:46.446
she'll just come back
again and again,

19:46.489 --> 19:48.535
until the well runs dry.

19:48.578 --> 19:49.971
Do you love me?

19:50.014 --> 19:51.059
At all?

19:51.102 --> 19:53.061
What?
Of course I do.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.716
Then, for once, stop arguing and
do what your husband demands--

19:55.759 --> 19:57.718
no, no-- implores you to do.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.241
And if you can't...

19:59.285 --> 20:01.156
Well, perhaps,
this isn't a marriage at all.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.245
Where are you going?

20:03.289 --> 20:05.029
I'm going to sleep
in the guest room.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.423
I'll return to our bed when
you're a little less lethal.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.563
Hi.
Are you Mrs. Yost's nephew?

20:16.606 --> 20:18.782
Yeah, I'm Irving.
Who are you?

20:18.826 --> 20:20.871
Dee Fillcot.
I live next door.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.221
I wanted you to know

20:22.264 --> 20:23.918
my parents have been
looking after

20:23.961 --> 20:25.963
your aunt's dog
while she's away.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.444
The cops think she's dead.

20:28.488 --> 20:29.924
Oh.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.621
Did they find her body?

20:31.665 --> 20:33.797
Not yet, but
she was definitely robbed.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.278
The cops say whoever robbed her

20:36.322 --> 20:38.280
probably killed her.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.196
Robbed?
Are you sure?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.198
Yeah, they took a bunch of stuff
from the house.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.331
A cut-glass vase,
an antique brass pitcher,

20:45.374 --> 20:47.681
and a fancy French painting
worth lots of money.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.030
French painting.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.901
There may be other stuff
missing, too.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.207
I'm still doing inventory.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.426
So, if you don't mind.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.254
Yeah.
Yeah, go ahead.

21:08.658 --> 21:11.095
â™ª

21:27.764 --> 21:29.592
[knocking]

21:32.116 --> 21:33.640
Is Miss Castillo here?

21:33.683 --> 21:35.772
I'm a P.I. investigating
her father's death.

21:35.816 --> 21:36.817
I am sorry.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.079
She is not at home.

21:38.122 --> 21:40.255
That's okay.
I'll wait.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.779
-She may be some time,
Mr., uh...
-SCOOTER: Loomis

21:42.823 --> 21:44.477
is his name.

21:44.520 --> 21:45.826
Scooter.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.001
Well, look at you.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.655
You can go now, Otto.

21:48.698 --> 21:52.006
Don't worry, my old pal
won't be staying long.

21:55.488 --> 21:56.924
What are you doing here?

21:56.967 --> 21:58.665
Working for Rita.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.754
She says she's being framed.

22:00.797 --> 22:02.103
Let's talk in here.

22:02.146 --> 22:04.061
I don't trust Adolph, Jr.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.020
I'd love to help Rita.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.674
I never went upstairs
that night.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.458
I don't know
what happened to Carlo.

22:09.502 --> 22:12.418
Yeah. You were down here
screwing her daughter-in-law.

22:13.810 --> 22:16.770
Just so you know,
I'm living with Catherine now.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.946
And we've developed
sincere feelings for each other.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.600
That a new watch?

22:22.079 --> 22:24.778
Look, I'm busy.

22:24.821 --> 22:25.779
So, if there's nothing else...

22:25.822 --> 22:27.302
One question.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.782
Now, is there a chance

22:28.825 --> 22:31.045
that anyone else
was in this house that night?

22:31.088 --> 22:32.351
As far as I know, it was just

22:32.394 --> 22:35.049
me, Catherine, Rita and Isabel.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.399
And you, outside, taking photos.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.706
And I gave those photos
to Isabel.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.664
Then she came back
wanting money.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.100
She hinted that one of my photos

22:43.144 --> 22:44.798
could prove
that Rita's innocent.

22:44.841 --> 22:47.061
I'm thinking that maybe
I got somebody on film,

22:47.104 --> 22:48.845
somebody we don't know about.

22:48.889 --> 22:51.674
When I was here with Catherine,
on the sofa that night,

22:51.718 --> 22:53.415
I thought I heard something.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.286
Like a door closing.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.114
Maybe someone else was here.

22:57.158 --> 22:58.333
Thanks, Scooter.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.553
That's what I needed to hear.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.337
Glad to help.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.600
Hey, Scooter.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.907
You ever think
about Dee Fillcot?

23:07.995 --> 23:10.171
Sure.
Now and then.

23:10.214 --> 23:11.607
Do me a favor.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.261
Forget about her.

23:18.005 --> 23:19.528
Mr. Loomis?

23:19.572 --> 23:21.530
I was curious.

23:21.574 --> 23:24.446
Since you are an old friend
of Mr. Scooter,

23:24.490 --> 23:26.492
I assume you have been
to his old apartment?

23:26.535 --> 23:28.450
Yeah.
Why do you ask?

23:28.494 --> 23:31.453
He wants me to retrieve
a few items he left behind.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.716
I am embarrassed to say

23:33.760 --> 23:37.459
that I cannot
read his handwriting.

23:37.503 --> 23:40.419
Is the address, uh, um, eight...

23:41.811 --> 23:43.944
He lived at 812 Rosewood.

23:43.987 --> 23:45.467
In the middle of Chinatown.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.730
812 Rosewood.
That is it.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.732
Thank you.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.566
Morning.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.266
I had a brilliant idea
last night.

24:03.267 --> 24:04.399
I'm not talking to you.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.748
Why?

24:05.792 --> 24:08.142
Because you're a horrible woman.

24:09.535 --> 24:12.799
I've come up with a way
for us to pay off Isabel

24:12.842 --> 24:16.411
that leaves her breathing
and won't cost us a cent.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.934
Really?

24:17.978 --> 24:20.894
Not so horrible now, am I?

24:20.937 --> 24:22.504
Yes, yes.
What's your idea?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.506
We'll sell Mrs. Yost's things.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.769
Most of them are antiques.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.510
They must be worth
thousands of dollars.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.120
Alma, that's theft.

24:30.164 --> 24:33.123
You want to commit one crime
to cover up another.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.560
Bertram,

24:34.603 --> 24:36.953
for someone who's
murdered dozens of people,

24:36.997 --> 24:39.826
you can be a real
stick in the mud.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.441
Morning, Dee.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.531
What do you know
about Mrs. Yost?

24:51.794 --> 24:53.579
I beg your pardon?

24:53.622 --> 24:56.799
Her nephew gave me a list
of items missing from her home.

24:56.843 --> 24:59.323
Every one of them
is in our living room.

24:59.367 --> 25:00.760
I want an explanation.

25:03.632 --> 25:05.242
Well...

25:05.286 --> 25:07.680
It was your mother's idea.
She made me do it.

25:10.204 --> 25:11.553
Darling...

25:11.597 --> 25:13.163
there's a simple explanation,

25:13.207 --> 25:16.471
if you'll just calm down
for a moment.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.517
I'm calm.
Let's hear it.

25:22.216 --> 25:25.480
Do you remember when the
Garden Club ladies came over?

25:25.524 --> 25:29.223
I felt that our home could use
a little bit of sprucing up.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.530
And since Mrs. Yost
was away on a trip

25:31.573 --> 25:33.880
and we were
looking after her dog,

25:33.923 --> 25:37.144
I thought that she wouldn't mind
if we borrowed a few trinkets.

25:37.187 --> 25:38.232
[chuckles]
See?

25:38.275 --> 25:40.626
No big deal.

25:40.669 --> 25:41.844
[short chuckle]

25:42.845 --> 25:44.891
The police think
whoever stole from Mrs. Yost

25:44.934 --> 25:46.414
may have killed her.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.590
Well, then they're not
very good at their jobs.

25:48.634 --> 25:49.896
Shall I make pancakes?

25:49.939 --> 25:51.419
Wait.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.290
If you only borrowed
the trinkets for a party,

25:53.334 --> 25:54.988
why didn't you
return them afterwards?

25:55.031 --> 25:56.859
She's got you there.

25:56.903 --> 25:59.993
-So help me God...
-It doesn't matter.

26:00.036 --> 26:01.908
Because as soon
as her nephew leaves,

26:01.951 --> 26:03.257
I'm putting everything back.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.476
And I don't want
any guff from you two.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.568
Well...

26:09.611 --> 26:11.395
I'll go to the bank, shall I?

26:11.439 --> 26:13.310
Start emptying
our savings account.

26:13.354 --> 26:14.964
Wait.

26:17.271 --> 26:20.013
Perhaps if we just
kidnap Isabel.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.971
Horrible.

26:23.407 --> 26:25.061
[scoffs]

26:39.075 --> 26:40.642
It's a surprise.
I can't tell you.

26:40.686 --> 26:43.079
Surprise?
It's not my birthday.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.212
What is this?

26:45.255 --> 26:47.127
-I bought you a new dress.
-Oh.

26:48.345 --> 26:49.695
[gasps]

26:49.738 --> 26:51.784
Where did you
get the money for this?

26:51.827 --> 26:53.176
Never mind.
Just hurry.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.525
Carlo Castillo
is gonna be here soon.

26:54.569 --> 26:55.875
Carlo?

26:55.918 --> 26:57.746
He never asks
for anyone but Gloria.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.792
Gloria got fired.

26:59.835 --> 27:02.229
[gasps]

27:02.272 --> 27:04.666
Last time Carlo was here
his watch went missing.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.320
Why would she steal his watch?

27:06.363 --> 27:08.452
I heard he was starting
to get sweet on her.

27:08.496 --> 27:10.019
I swiped his watch.

27:10.063 --> 27:12.108
Then I pawned it
to pay for this dress.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.675
Isabel.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.372
[laughs]
What could you be thinking?

27:15.416 --> 27:18.419
Carlo ain't just rich,
he's lonely.

27:18.462 --> 27:21.988
He likes his whores, but
what he really wants is a lady.

27:22.031 --> 27:23.816
You know how to class it up.

27:23.859 --> 27:27.167
I bet he'll get sweet on you
in no time.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.385
Buy you gifts.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.126
Give you big tips.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.781
-He might even take you away
from all this.
-Oh.

27:35.349 --> 27:36.742
Well?

27:36.785 --> 27:38.221
What do you think?

27:40.310 --> 27:41.921
That should do the trick.

27:41.964 --> 27:43.705
You take such good care of me.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.925
Always and forever, kid.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.668
Always and forever.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.464
Excuse me, sir.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.074
Do you live in this building?

28:05.118 --> 28:06.336
I'm the landlord.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.729
What do you want?

28:07.773 --> 28:09.557
Some information.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.213
About a previous tenant--
Scooter Polarsky.

28:13.256 --> 28:14.997
The pretty-boy actor?

28:15.041 --> 28:16.303
That's him.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.044
Would you happen to know

28:18.087 --> 28:21.221
who was paying for his rent
while he was staying here?

28:21.264 --> 28:22.831
I'd like to help you, lady.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.267
But that's confidential.

28:43.852 --> 28:45.898
â™ª

29:03.045 --> 29:05.656
â™ª

29:23.370 --> 29:24.850
IRVING:
Dee?

29:24.893 --> 29:27.156
Irving, hi.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.289
Didn't I see you drive away
a few minutes ago?

29:29.332 --> 29:30.856
I forgot my wallet.

29:30.899 --> 29:32.074
What's going on?

29:32.118 --> 29:34.076
Oh, I was just...

29:34.120 --> 29:35.861
looking for Rocco.

29:35.904 --> 29:37.253
Yeah.
He keeps getting out.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.559
Thanks again
for taking care of him.

29:38.602 --> 29:39.690
No problem.

29:39.734 --> 29:41.692
I just hope your aunt turns up.

29:41.736 --> 29:43.433
He loves her so much.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.958
Do you have any idea where
she was going when she left?

29:46.001 --> 29:48.090
The cops seem to have run
into a dead end.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.831
Didn't she go to see her sister?

29:49.875 --> 29:52.007
No.
My aunt only had one sister,

29:52.051 --> 29:53.966
and Mom died two years ago.

29:55.141 --> 29:57.491
Mrs. Yost's sister is dead?

29:57.534 --> 30:00.015
Yeah.
Why did you think she wasn't?

30:01.103 --> 30:02.713
I don't know.

30:02.757 --> 30:04.933
So the police
may stop by tomorrow.

30:04.977 --> 30:06.021
If you think of anything...

30:06.065 --> 30:07.849
I'll make sure to tell them.

30:46.714 --> 30:48.759
[phone rings]

30:52.067 --> 30:53.242
Hello?

30:53.286 --> 30:55.636
Good.
I'm glad I caught you.

30:55.679 --> 30:57.420
Loomis, you got the money?

30:57.464 --> 30:59.770
No, but I know what you got.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.729
-And what's that?
-One of my photos.

31:01.772 --> 31:04.297
It shows somebody in that house
the night of the murder.

31:04.340 --> 31:05.864
Someone who's not Rita.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.867
Till you know who it is,
you don't know nothing.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.477
I want my cash.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.305
I can go to Rita,
explain what you want.

31:12.348 --> 31:14.524
But when she finds out
you're letting her rot in jail

31:14.568 --> 31:16.526
-when you could prove
she's innocent...
-Yeah,

31:16.570 --> 31:19.573
it's gonna to hurt. But not any
more than the way she hurt me.

31:19.616 --> 31:22.141
This is a lousy way to let her
know how you feel, Isabel.

31:22.184 --> 31:23.707
You don't know.

31:23.751 --> 31:25.927
The way she treated me,
after all I did for her.

31:25.971 --> 31:29.409
What you're doing, it is not
right, and it's not justice.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.932
So I am begging you.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.543
If you ever truly loved Rita,

31:33.587 --> 31:35.328
do right by her.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.471
Okay.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.386
I'll give you the photo.

31:50.430 --> 31:52.998
Show it to the D.A. or whoever
can get her out of jail.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.477
Thank you.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.262
I can come over there right now.

31:56.305 --> 31:58.264
No.
I still need it.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.614
Certain people got to pay
for what they did.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.746
Come to my hotel, 10:00 p.m.

32:07.969 --> 32:09.275
Rona, we're gonna need

32:09.318 --> 32:10.841
some more of these
gauze bandages.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.452
No, it's me.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.194
Is now a bad time?

32:15.237 --> 32:16.847
Not really.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.371
Come in.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.940
I, uh...

32:21.983 --> 32:24.594
I've been doing
some thinking, and...

32:24.638 --> 32:28.033
I see now that I've made
a total mess of our lives.

32:30.339 --> 32:32.124
I'm so sorry.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.301
Thank you.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.085
So...

32:37.129 --> 32:40.088
Have you been to the bank yet?

32:40.132 --> 32:42.873
Yes, I emptied our accounts.

32:42.917 --> 32:46.225
And I borrowed the rest
off an old school chum.

32:46.268 --> 32:48.314
Mr. Gray is on line one for you.

32:48.357 --> 32:49.489
Speak of the devil.

32:49.532 --> 32:50.490
I'll take it in here.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.013
Thank you, Rona.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.972
Excuse me.

32:56.104 --> 32:57.192
Georgie.

32:57.236 --> 32:58.977
Hello, old boy.

32:59.020 --> 33:01.283
Yes, yes, I got the check.

33:01.327 --> 33:02.937
Yes, I'm a fool

33:02.981 --> 33:04.852
to have gotten in such a jam.

33:06.114 --> 33:08.029
It won't happen again.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.900
Yes, I promise.

33:09.944 --> 33:11.902
Georgie.

33:11.946 --> 33:13.208
Thank you.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.081
Bye-bye.

33:19.301 --> 33:21.477
What did you say
the money was for?

33:21.521 --> 33:23.566
Gambling debts.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.916
Loan sharks
threatening to break my legs.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.006
I couldn't think how else
to explain the urgency.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.704
-That must have been
humiliating.
-Yes.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.488
Just a bit.

33:32.532 --> 33:34.447
Alma...

33:34.490 --> 33:36.188
I want you to know,

33:36.231 --> 33:38.668
it means a great deal that you
came here and apologized.

33:38.712 --> 33:42.324
I saw you yesterday,
looking at our wedding album.

33:42.368 --> 33:45.066
Wondering where the woman
you married had gone.

33:45.110 --> 33:48.026
I want you to know
that she's still here.

33:49.940 --> 33:52.030
She still loves you.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.469
Deeply.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.081
That's good to know.

34:00.125 --> 34:03.084
Now, if we can just
get over this one last hurdle.

34:04.868 --> 34:06.827
We will.

34:06.870 --> 34:08.829
I'm not worried.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.096
-Well, I should go.
-Yes.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.011
-Mwah.
-Bye.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.795
Goodbye.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.938
â™ª

34:38.337 --> 34:40.730
SCOOTER:
Calm down a second.
I can explain!

34:40.774 --> 34:42.123
CATHERINE:
Why should I believe you?

34:42.167 --> 34:43.733
Every word out of your mouth
is a lie.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.953
-You never cared for me.
Admit it!
-[crash]

34:45.996 --> 34:47.694
SCOOTER:
Hey, you almost hit me.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.435
CATHERINE:
Just admit it! Rita asked you

34:49.478 --> 34:52.133
to seduce me
just to get that photo.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.526
SCOOTER:
You're right.

34:53.569 --> 34:55.180
That was the plan.

34:55.223 --> 34:57.225
Rita asked me to pretend
I liked you.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.053
But after a while,

34:59.097 --> 35:00.968
I didn't have to pretend,
because you're amazing.

35:01.011 --> 35:03.492
And I really
began to care for you.

35:03.536 --> 35:06.539
Look at the actor,
telling his pretty lies.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.019
Yes.

35:09.063 --> 35:10.891
In the beginning,
I was playing a part.

35:10.934 --> 35:14.242
But then I-I started to see that
you're everything Rita isn't.

35:14.286 --> 35:17.593
You're warm a-and kind
and loving.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.552
Rita could be...

35:19.595 --> 35:21.641
really mean.

35:23.991 --> 35:26.167
That's because she's evil.

35:26.211 --> 35:27.951
Well, that's
a little bit strong.

35:27.995 --> 35:29.431
No.

35:29.475 --> 35:30.911
She is.

35:30.954 --> 35:33.000
She corrupted you.

35:33.043 --> 35:35.698
She used you
to help her kill Papa.

35:35.742 --> 35:38.048
You think?

35:38.092 --> 35:40.268
That's why she asked you
to seduce me.

35:40.312 --> 35:43.358
To keep me distracted
while she poisoned him.

35:43.402 --> 35:44.751
Are you sure?

35:44.794 --> 35:46.883
Didn't she hate my papa?

35:46.927 --> 35:48.537
I guess you could say that.

35:48.581 --> 35:49.712
No.

35:49.756 --> 35:53.020
You will say that, in court.

35:53.063 --> 35:54.630
In court?

35:54.674 --> 35:56.893
You will testify against Rita.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.244
I don't know...

35:59.287 --> 36:02.116
This is how you will prove
your love to me.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.989
And I will take such good care
of you in return.

36:14.302 --> 36:17.131
[both moaning]

36:17.175 --> 36:18.915
SCOOTER:
Oh, like that?

36:18.959 --> 36:20.917
CATHERINE: All right,
take your clothes off.

36:38.587 --> 36:39.936
[doorbell rings]

36:40.937 --> 36:42.896
Hey, Cousin.

36:42.939 --> 36:44.898
Look at you.
[gasps]

36:44.941 --> 36:46.508
Isabel.

36:46.552 --> 36:48.858
Oh, how I've missed you.

36:49.859 --> 36:53.254
I'm so sorry it took so long
for me to send for you.

36:53.298 --> 36:54.951
Who cares?

36:54.995 --> 36:56.257
I'm here now.

36:56.301 --> 36:57.780
Look at this place.

36:57.824 --> 37:00.609
I'm finally
gonna be living in style.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.655
[chuckling]: Yes.
Well...

37:02.698 --> 37:04.918
Let's sit over here.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.093
Everything okay?

37:06.136 --> 37:07.921
You seem anxious.

37:07.964 --> 37:10.097
Well...

37:12.882 --> 37:14.623
Living with Carlo is tricky.

37:14.667 --> 37:17.409
He can be moody

37:17.452 --> 37:19.498
and he drinks.
A lot.

37:19.541 --> 37:22.370
Well, Izzy is here now
to protect you,

37:22.414 --> 37:24.067
like when we were little.

37:24.111 --> 37:26.635
Except now, I don't think
we'll have to share a room.

37:26.679 --> 37:27.897
[chuckling]: No.

37:29.116 --> 37:30.770
Is that a gift for me?

37:30.813 --> 37:32.598
Um...

37:32.641 --> 37:35.296
Yes, but I need to explain it.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.994
-Since when
you got to explain a gift?
-It's just, Carlo

37:38.038 --> 37:40.214
set certain conditions
for you to stay here.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.129
What conditions?

37:47.526 --> 37:49.354
You expect me to be your maid?

37:49.397 --> 37:50.877
It's not what I want.

37:50.920 --> 37:54.054
It was the only way
to get Carlo to agree,

37:54.097 --> 37:55.534
and I need you here.

37:55.577 --> 37:56.883
As a maid.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.363
As a friend.

37:58.406 --> 38:00.321
Carlo's old.

38:00.365 --> 38:03.498
He won't live
more than another year or two,

38:03.542 --> 38:06.240
and when he dies, we'll be rich.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.243
I'll finally be able
to take care of you.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.853
Oh, please say yes.

38:10.897 --> 38:12.333
Please.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.509
Once he's gone, we'll be free.

38:14.553 --> 38:15.728
Okay?

38:16.685 --> 38:18.426
Please.

38:36.401 --> 38:37.924
[knocking]

38:45.148 --> 38:47.716
-What's he doing here?
-You didn't think I'd come here

38:47.760 --> 38:49.022
without my husband
to protect me?

38:49.065 --> 38:50.545
Why do you need protection
from me?

38:50.589 --> 38:51.894
I'm not dangerous.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.156
Yes, and neither is my wife.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.506
Here's your money.

38:54.549 --> 38:56.377
Give us the photograph
and negative.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.074
Not till I count it.

38:58.118 --> 38:59.249
Come in.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.080
[door closes]

39:07.257 --> 39:08.737
It's a horrible thing
you're doing.

39:08.781 --> 39:10.652
That's all the money
we have in the world.

39:10.696 --> 39:12.306
I don't feel sorry for you.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.178
My cousin's in jail
'cause of what you two did.

39:15.222 --> 39:16.397
Rita is your cousin?

39:16.441 --> 39:17.442
Don't believe me?

39:17.485 --> 39:19.008
Look for yourself.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.142
[sighs]

39:24.449 --> 39:26.668
Looks like it's all here.

39:26.712 --> 39:28.801
Yes, of course it is.
Just give us what we came for.

39:28.844 --> 39:31.151
About that, no can do.

39:31.194 --> 39:32.979
-What?
-I don't mean to be difficult.

39:33.022 --> 39:36.417
But if Rita does go to trial,
I got to be able to protect her.

39:36.461 --> 39:37.592
The negative is ours.

39:37.636 --> 39:38.811
We've just paid for it.

39:38.854 --> 39:40.552
What can I say?
Life ain't fair.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.641
So true.

39:42.684 --> 39:43.729
Aah!

39:43.772 --> 39:45.339
-Alma!
-That hurt!

39:45.383 --> 39:46.993
What have you done?

39:47.036 --> 39:48.821
You heard her.

39:48.864 --> 39:50.388
She was gonna turn us in
to protect Rita.

39:50.431 --> 39:52.259
What was that?
I can't breathe...

39:52.302 --> 39:53.608
Don't worry, I'm a doctor.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.262
You're a vet.
[coughing]

39:57.046 --> 39:58.265
What did you give her?

39:58.308 --> 39:59.658
The same thing you gave Carlo.

39:59.701 --> 40:01.224
I-I can never pronounce it.

40:01.268 --> 40:03.531
That's why you came
to my office, isn't it?

40:03.575 --> 40:05.925
Not to apologize
but to steal the drug.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.622
[Isabel panting]

40:07.666 --> 40:09.363
You're gonna
burn in hell for this!

40:10.930 --> 40:12.627
Alma, you lied to me.

40:13.846 --> 40:15.456
You don't care
about our marriage at all.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.936
Killing is stressful enough

40:16.979 --> 40:19.460
without quarreling
in front of the victim.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.593
[gurgles]

40:28.208 --> 40:30.036
You killed her.

40:30.079 --> 40:31.646
To save us.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.387
She died...

40:33.431 --> 40:35.084
in fear.

40:35.128 --> 40:36.434
And pain.

40:36.477 --> 40:37.696
No sedative.

40:37.739 --> 40:38.827
No tenderness.

40:38.871 --> 40:40.742
She was blackmailing us.

40:40.786 --> 40:43.136
Go to the car.
I want to be alone with her.

40:43.179 --> 40:44.616
Why?

40:44.659 --> 40:46.618
To say goodbye properly.

40:46.661 --> 40:49.621
-Bertram...
-Go to the car!

40:51.666 --> 40:53.929
I don't understand.

40:53.973 --> 40:55.714
I know you don't.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.672
You never have.

41:11.556 --> 41:14.472
-I'm sorry.

Yes.

Miss Duarte?

42:28.197 --> 42:30.112
Miss Duarte?

43:00.578 --> 43:02.797
Thank you for coming in
so early, Mr. Greeley.

43:02.841 --> 43:04.799
As I said on the phone,

43:04.843 --> 43:07.280
I have something very important
to discuss with you.

43:07.323 --> 43:09.674
And, uh,
I have something to tell you.

43:09.717 --> 43:11.153
Let me begin.

43:12.894 --> 43:15.549
Isabel is my family.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.247
I will not sacrifice her
to save myself.

43:18.291 --> 43:19.597
Hold on, Rita...

43:19.640 --> 43:21.424
My decision is final,
Mr. Greeley.

43:21.468 --> 43:23.862
You'll have to think of another
way to get me out of here.

43:23.905 --> 43:25.603
Shouldn't be too difficult.

43:25.646 --> 43:27.474
After all, I am innocent.

43:32.827 --> 43:35.743
Isabel killed herself
last night.

43:37.702 --> 43:39.138
What?

43:39.181 --> 43:40.313
And she left a note.

43:40.356 --> 43:42.837
A confession, really.

43:42.881 --> 43:44.926
She says
she killed your husband.

Good. I got it.

Okay.
