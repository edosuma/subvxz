00:52.520 --> 00:56.434
Celeste was
born in America in 1986.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.360
Considering her parents'
background, education,

01:02.400 --> 01:04.596
and socioeconomic status,

01:04.640 --> 01:07.838
being somewhat on
the losing side of Reaganomics,

01:07.920 --> 01:12.472
the name of Latin origin seemed
an especially poetic choice.

01:12.520 --> 01:16.150
It carved her out some
predetermined destination,

01:16.200 --> 01:19.716
a route which to travel by.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.753
And many years before "Celeste"
rolled off the cultural tongue

01:22.800 --> 01:26.794
like a principled anecdote one
senses they were born knowing,

01:26.840 --> 01:29.674
she might not have been
described as all that special

01:29.720 --> 01:31.712
or conspicuously talented.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.878
However, she did possess
that proverbial "something,"

01:34.920 --> 01:37.879
which on occasion captured
the attention of her teachers

01:37.920 --> 01:40.310
and young peers.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.797
Despite what naysayers later
perceived of her ingenuity,

01:43.840 --> 01:47.197
she was actually
a very savvy businesswoman.

01:47.240 --> 01:50.995
In the beginning, she was kind
and full of grace,

01:51.040 --> 01:54.112
and at least she wrote
her own lyrics.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.994
No one could take that
away from her.

01:57.040 --> 02:00.192
She would be 13
going on 14 years old

02:00.240 --> 02:02.072
in the year 2000,

02:02.120 --> 02:04.715
the dawn
of the new millennium.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.237
Morning.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.512
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.313
- Hello.
- Welcome back.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.432
- Good morning.
- Hi. Happy New Year.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.120
Therese, did you change
your hair?

04:46.160 --> 04:49.312
Uh, my sister cut it.
She's a hairdresser.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.114
Oh. Does she work in town?
I want a cut like that.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.595
Really? Uh, well,
she lives out of state.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.597
She was visiting us
for the holidays,

04:56.640 --> 04:58.791
but I can let you know
when she's back.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.639
Would you mind?
Sometimes you feel like a change.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.194
Sure, I can.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.760
- Hello.
- What's up?

05:05.800 --> 05:08.315
- Good morning.
- Hi.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.273
- Hi. Welcome back.
- Good morning.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.154
Okay.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.352
Welcome back, everybody.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.677
- Did you enjoy the break?
- Yes. Yeah.

05:21.720 --> 05:25.350
- Did you enjoy the break?
- Yes.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.438
Well, I received news
from Vice Principal Kane

05:28.480 --> 05:31.314
about our homeroom
computer appeal.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.079
What is it?

05:33.120 --> 05:35.589
I want to wait and share it
once everyone's arrived.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.678
We're waiting on, um,
Eric and Elyse.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.951
Well,
they're probably gonna take a while.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.799
Why is that?

05:43.840 --> 05:46.275
Aidan, let's not start
the year off at odds.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.677
Whatever you're saying to him,
you can save it for after class.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.599
He's here.
I saw Eric five minutes ago.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.816
- All right, then. We'll wait.
- Are we getting desktops?

05:54.840 --> 05:57.230
- I said we'll wait.
- Excuse me.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.839
Yes?

05:58.920 --> 06:01.594
My name is
Cullen Active.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.030
What?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.437
Yes, Cullen, I know.

06:17.520 --> 06:18.954
Celeste?

06:21.200 --> 06:24.113
Celeste, go stand in the back
with the others.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.992
Is she breathing?

06:28.040 --> 06:30.350
No.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.869
Celeste,
you need to get up

06:32.920 --> 06:35.310
and step away from the windows,
because in a few minutes

06:35.360 --> 06:37.397
there will be
an explosion.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.432
What are you doing?

06:39.480 --> 06:41.756
Why are you doing this?

06:43.480 --> 06:46.871
Stop! Stop!

06:46.920 --> 06:48.832
I'm standing.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.712
I'll stand.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.638
Now everyone,
please shut up and be quiet.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.916
Go back inside!

07:23.920 --> 07:25.639
Cullen?

07:27.520 --> 07:29.796
Cullen, please let us go.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.830
I killed plenty
of people already.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.959
I'm sorry.
I can't do that now.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.880
Please.
At least let everyone else go.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.912
I'll stay here with you.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.431
And what are
we gonna do?

07:59.400 --> 08:01.312
We'll pray together.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.674
Shh. Everything's gonna be...

08:46.760 --> 08:49.958
- Clear.
- Adam Seven, clear in the classroom.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.070
Clear!

09:10.840 --> 09:13.594
Adam Seven, be advised...
multiple 80s.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.996
Room 206, second floor.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.518
Breathe
in and hold your breath.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.673
Breathe.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.753
What are
you feeling now?

12:56.800 --> 12:59.076
I feel like
I'm on a boat.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.600
Nausea won't subside?

13:00.640 --> 13:02.438
It's not just that.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.711
I just feel
like I'm spinning.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.319
You think
it's in my head?

13:06.360 --> 13:08.272
No, I don't think
it's in your head at all.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.358
I just don't think it has anything
to do with your spinal injury.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.790
I need to sit.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.674
I'll get your chair.
Just a minute. Come on.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.394
Do you want to try
a few more steps?

13:19.440 --> 13:21.397
Okay. Good.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.159
All right.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.714
- There you go.
- Where's Dad and Eleanor?

13:28.760 --> 13:31.434
They went to
get us some food.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.551
Some of the other kids
have been complaining

13:33.600 --> 13:36.798
about their ears ringing
from the gun blasts.

13:36.840 --> 13:40.356
I talked to her doctor
about it, and...

13:40.400 --> 13:42.198
Great.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.359
- Hey, Mrs. Howard.
- Hello, Miss Celeste.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.997
I'm so sorry
I was sick.

13:59.040 --> 14:03.432
I should've
been there for you.

14:03.480 --> 14:06.917
I'm so grateful
you're alive.

14:06.960 --> 14:12.274
I think I would have died...
or just killed myself.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.960
I don't think
I could've standed it.

14:21.240 --> 14:25.234
I'm here now,
and I am never going to leave you.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.919
Ever.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.231
My God.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.398
Ellie,
I think I've done something terrible.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.479
What is it?

14:47.520 --> 14:50.433
It says here they found
Cullen's grandparents.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.776
They think that he shot both of
them three weeks before Christmas

14:52.800 --> 14:55.360
and lived with the bodies
over the holiday.

14:55.400 --> 14:56.550
- Ew!
- Dad...

14:56.600 --> 14:58.831
- Excuse me.
- Stop.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.556
I'm sorry. There are some news
people here requesting an interview.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.593
Oh, well, don't look at me.
It's up to her.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.951
I don't want anyone
to see me like this.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.753
You look fine.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.675
Can you talk
to them?

15:14.720 --> 15:16.154
Me?

15:16.200 --> 15:18.317
What am
I supposed to say?

15:18.360 --> 15:20.556
I wasn't there.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.877
Just tell them how sorry we
are for everyone that died.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.038
Call Mom.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.873
Are you sure?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.231
I can take you
to a telephone.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.193
Thanks, babe.

15:47.240 --> 15:50.438
- I think I want to try and sleep for a while.
- Good.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.872
I think I am going to try
and take your mother

15:53.920 --> 15:55.718
out to dinner
or something.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.877
Get her mind
off of things.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.640
Sure you don't need anything
else other than that keyboard?

16:00.680 --> 16:02.751
You know, I have a guitar
in the basement.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.076
Could bring that over,
teach you a little.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.713
Thanks, but...

16:06.760 --> 16:10.037
it's hard for me
to tilt my head down.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.673
So it starts like...

16:11.720 --> 16:14.713
so, one, two, three.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.638
Yeah.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.194
Twice.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.317
...remain
in critical condition.

16:59.360 --> 17:02.717
Hold them especially
in your prayers.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.517
Please join me now

17:07.560 --> 17:10.519
by turning to the page 13.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.391
I was informed earlier,

17:31.440 --> 17:33.432
and I guess some of you
are already aware,

17:33.480 --> 17:35.597
of last night's
arson attempt

17:35.640 --> 17:38.155
over at
the Active residence.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.152
Lieutenant Lynne at
the 120th Precinct has asked me

17:43.200 --> 17:46.034
to remind everyone
that that is the site

17:46.080 --> 17:49.118
of an ongoing
investigation,

17:51.600 --> 17:54.035
and its destruction would...

17:54.080 --> 17:58.836
gravely impair their officers'
ability to provide answers

17:58.880 --> 18:01.270
to the community's
many pressing questions.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.876
I would like to add...

18:04.920 --> 18:07.276
ferocious anger
prompted this,

18:07.320 --> 18:11.109
and we cannot have
any more anger

18:11.160 --> 18:14.676
or violence around us
this minute.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.792
I'll go a step further
by asking you all to please

18:17.840 --> 18:21.277
include the perpetrator

18:21.320 --> 18:24.836
of these vicious attacks
in your prayers.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.317
By this way of

18:29.360 --> 18:31.556
healing prayer

18:31.600 --> 18:34.320
and forgiveness,

18:34.360 --> 18:38.274
victims of this tragedy
will be...

18:38.320 --> 18:41.154
released from
their own grief

18:41.200 --> 18:45.114
and rage in the afterlife.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.517
Throughout the night, we'll be
asking New Brighton students

18:48.560 --> 18:51.234
to come up and share

18:51.280 --> 18:54.830
memories and recollections
with us.

18:56.920 --> 19:01.153
Please join me in welcoming
Celeste Montgomery

19:01.200 --> 19:03.954
from Stephanie Dwyer's
eighth-grade class.

19:22.320 --> 19:26.872
Um, I tried to prepare
something to say,

19:26.920 --> 19:31.517
but... I couldn't really put
my feelings into words exactly,

19:31.560 --> 19:34.951
so I thought
I'd do this instead.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.313
Uh, my sister, Ellie,
helped me a lot.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.431
This song is about us,

19:41.480 --> 19:44.075

At the advice of a producer,
Celeste would change the lyric

21:59.600 --> 22:02.593
from "I" to "we,"
and shortly thereafter,

22:02.640 --> 22:05.838
the entire country fell in step
with her sentiment.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.714
It was not her grief;
it was theirs.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.752
No longer merely
her experience,

22:10.800 --> 22:13.554
they reclaimed it
as their own.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.671
Over the course
of the following year,

22:15.720 --> 22:19.600
The song would become
an anthem for the nation.

22:19.640 --> 22:23.111
Simply put, it was a hit.

from hearing my own voice.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.751
You want me to
pull that out?

24:30.800 --> 24:32.519
If you can do that, thanks.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.519
- No problem.
- Do you like it when I go

24:35.560 --> 24:38.917
- to the C before the refrain?
- No, not...

24:38.960 --> 24:42.351
- I thought that was D, sorry.
- That is a D right over there.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.471
Oh.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.557
Celeste,
let's take five.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.831
Meet me in the hall.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.031
You okay in there,
or are you in over your head?

24:56.080 --> 24:58.754
- No, I'm good.
- You trust me?

25:00.200 --> 25:01.759
Do you trust me?

25:01.800 --> 25:03.154
Yeah.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.596
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.711
That's good,
'cause I've been doing this a long time,

25:08.760 --> 25:10.680
and I can understand
if it's little overwhelming,

25:10.720 --> 25:13.110
but you have to trust
the process.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.914
The process works.
That's why you and your parents chose me

25:15.960 --> 25:18.031
to guide you
through this...

25:18.080 --> 25:20.720
strange and unpredictable
new process.

25:20.760 --> 25:24.231
So I want you to remember what I
told you at your parents' place

25:24.280 --> 25:26.920
the first time we met.

25:26.960 --> 25:30.397
You got to shut your eyes and
pretend like you're in your bedroom.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.896
You're just dancing in your bedroom,
and no one's looking at you,

25:32.920 --> 25:36.436
and you ain't got
a care in the world, okay?

25:36.480 --> 25:38.278
Okay.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.994
You got to tell me
if I'm not making any sense,

25:41.040 --> 25:44.256
'cause you got your head screwed on so
straight half the time I forget you're a kid.

25:44.280 --> 25:47.016
Don't worry yourself too much about the
technical stuff, 'cause I'm telling you,

25:47.040 --> 25:50.158
these people are not here to
listen to that fuckin' bass player

25:50.200 --> 25:53.398
riff like he's
Jaco Pastorius, hmm?

25:53.440 --> 25:55.671
- Okay.
- This is your show, okay?

25:55.720 --> 25:58.076
Remember that.
Run it. Okay?

25:58.120 --> 25:59.952
- You ready to get back into it?
- Yeah.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.276
- Good.
- But can you do me a favor?

26:02.320 --> 26:05.119
- Yeah.
- Can you watch your language around Ellie?

26:05.160 --> 26:07.516
It really bothers her
when people swear.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.591
Yeah, so I'm sorry.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.030
I-I, uh...

26:14.080 --> 26:17.198
I-I didn't realize
I was swearing at you.

26:17.240 --> 26:20.074
I wasn't thinking.
I'm sorry. Okay.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.176
So I just quickly
cut something together

26:24.200 --> 26:26.078
for the first
and the last verse,

26:26.120 --> 26:27.696
and it actually seems like
it's working really well.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.030
We might be over-thinking it.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.471
In the first verse, though, there's a
little crack or a hiccup or something

26:33.520 --> 26:36.160
in your delivery of
"'Cause I missed the train."

26:36.200 --> 26:38.669
So maybe we should just
take it from there?

26:38.720 --> 26:40.677
Great.
I'll nail that.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.916
Then we can get started
on "Body Talk."

26:42.960 --> 26:45.156
I'm sorry,
what section is that?

26:45.200 --> 26:47.840
It's the next track.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.239
Okay. Yeah.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.476
Let's get a head start
on tomorrow.

26:58.120 --> 27:00.430
Okay, here we go.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.676
I'm sorry I'm late.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.837
Thank you for waiting.

27:12.880 --> 27:15.759
Have you girls
been enjoying your stay?

27:15.800 --> 27:18.634
Yeah.
The hotel's very nice.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.592
Yeah. It's great.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.674
So, what's next?

27:23.720 --> 27:25.996
She beat me to the punch.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.316
Well, a few things.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.034
First, I've been meaning
to ask you if you, uh,

27:32.080 --> 27:34.356
have any background
in dance,

27:34.400 --> 27:36.232
or if your injury

27:36.280 --> 27:39.079
- prevents you from...
- I used to take ballet.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.315
And no.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.397
I just have to
be careful.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.272
That's great.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.835
Internally we've been discussing
a few upcoming events,

27:46.880 --> 27:49.554
performances we'd like
to pitch you for,

27:49.600 --> 27:52.115
and we'd love to set you up
with a choreographer.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.800
What kind of appearances?

27:54.840 --> 27:57.036
In-store performances,
things like that.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.958
It's a great way
to introduce

27:59.000 --> 28:01.151
your live experience
to the public

28:01.240 --> 28:05.678
and a great way for you to
get your feet wet in turn.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.280
Uh, Celeste,

28:08.320 --> 28:11.950
we really love
what you do here,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.674
but after everything
you've been through,

28:14.720 --> 28:18.077
I just think it's necessary to
be really straight with you

28:18.120 --> 28:20.555
and let you know
that there is

28:20.600 --> 28:22.557
no guarantee that
these new tracks will work.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.434
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
She's 14 years old.

28:25.480 --> 28:29.315
You don't need to talk that way to her.
Talk to me that way, not her.

28:29.360 --> 28:31.955
Let me finish, please.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.913
it would be unconscionable
for me to

28:37.960 --> 28:40.191
not make a young person
like yourself fully cognizant

28:40.280 --> 28:43.239
of the reality
of the situation.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.476
You've given us
a great demo,

28:45.520 --> 28:48.160
and we are going to
pitch it hard,

28:48.200 --> 28:51.398
but... the rest
is out of our hands.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.238
It's fine.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.192
If it works, great.

28:55.240 --> 28:58.199
If not,
that's okay too.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.038
Well, that's great.

29:00.080 --> 29:02.515
On to the fun stuff then.

29:02.560 --> 29:06.190
This is what we had in mind
in terms of artwork

29:06.240 --> 29:10.757
for the EP that we'll be
sending to the stations.

29:10.800 --> 29:13.156
- What do you think?
- I like it.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.109
It's peach.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.152
We can change
the color.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.032
Just for now,

29:20.080 --> 29:22.754
try and focus more
on the feeling of the layout.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.397
- I like it.
- I like it too.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.680
Great. They know
what they like.

29:29.720 --> 29:31.757
That's great. We love it.

29:31.800 --> 29:35.555
The lyric inside of the font
gives it precedence,

29:35.600 --> 29:39.116
the advent of a new voice
being announced.

29:39.160 --> 29:43.439
But the most important thing to us
is that you feel well-represented.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.191
I feel well-represented.

29:47.240 --> 29:50.358
As your representative,
I'd like to express how highly unusual

29:50.400 --> 29:53.074
and inappropriate
that woman's conduct was.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.476
I had no idea
she was gonna sit down

29:55.520 --> 29:58.433
and give you a list of reasons that
she's not to be held accountable

29:58.480 --> 30:00.551
if she fails at her job.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.320
These salespeople are mostly the same.
Five minutes into a meeting

30:03.360 --> 30:06.000
you know they couldn't sell
a lifejacket to Natalie Wood.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.999
She was just telling me
not to get my hopes up.

30:09.040 --> 30:12.112
Of course you should
get your hopes up.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.629
Come on.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.354
So, from here,
pulling through five,

30:17.400 --> 30:19.437
walking six, seven,

30:19.480 --> 30:22.120
and down eight.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.914
Uh-huh, good.
So to do that slide,

30:27.080 --> 30:28.800
and you want to think
of actually lifting up

30:28.840 --> 30:30.718
as you're going down,
okay?

30:30.760 --> 30:34.197
You'll get more length on the slide.
Let me see it.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.553
- Good. You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.478
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

30:40.520 --> 30:42.671
- We can take a break if you need.
- No, no, I'm okay.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.633
Okay. I'm gonna put the disc on,
and let's go from the top.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.113
♪ I, I, I, I ♪

31:01.560 --> 31:04.234
♪ I, I, I, I ♪

31:04.280 --> 31:07.830
- Finding the beat.
- ♪ I, I, I, I ♪

31:09.600 --> 31:11.159
Ready?

31:11.200 --> 31:13.954
Step right, left.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.720
Good.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.319
Grapevine.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.832
Going forward.

31:42.840 --> 31:45.639
And going down.
Good, okay.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.558
When the chorus comes in,

31:47.600 --> 31:49.353
try to sing along
with the track,

31:49.400 --> 31:51.232
to see how that feels,
okay?

31:51.280 --> 31:53.272
And just focus
on breathing,

31:53.320 --> 31:55.376
because you want to have enough
air to get through the track.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.278
Okay? Ready?

31:57.320 --> 32:00.472
Five, six, seven, eight.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.314
Keep going.

32:22.880 --> 32:25.270
Good. Step.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.594
Low.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.472
And hit.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.519
Good.

32:39.840 --> 32:42.071
And right. Left.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.474
Walk.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.159
Up.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.834
Good.
That feel okay?

32:50.880 --> 32:53.111
- Yeah.
- Good, good.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.309
Is this what
you wanted to see? Huh?

33:35.360 --> 33:37.397
Is this what
you wanted to see?

33:37.440 --> 33:39.511
They came into our house...

33:41.760 --> 33:45.071
The government
called it Operation Reunion,

33:45.120 --> 33:47.237
a delicate mission
carried out

33:47.280 --> 33:48.999
with military precision.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.759
No one was
seriously injured.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.231
What if you get
really big?

33:57.680 --> 33:59.273
First of all,

33:59.320 --> 34:01.437
I don't think that's
even happening.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.314
And second,
even if it did,

34:04.360 --> 34:06.829
it's not like I wouldn't
come home all the time.

34:13.920 --> 34:17.311
Really think I'm gonna be
able to get in anywhere?

34:17.360 --> 34:18.589
Totally.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.599
You look like
you're 22.

34:21.639 --> 34:23.597
No way.

34:23.639 --> 34:25.472
You do.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.992
"Excuse me, sir.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.679
Have you met
my baby sister?

34:31.719 --> 34:33.996
She's so sexy,
isn't she?"

34:34.040 --> 34:35.440
Shut up.

34:35.480 --> 34:38.234
It's true.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.556
You're the pretty one,

34:40.639 --> 34:42.996
and you sing
better than me.

34:43.040 --> 34:46.511
I know. And I'm bigger
than you too.

34:47.560 --> 34:50.120
Stop! Stop!

34:50.159 --> 34:51.879
Sorry.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.230
Hurts my back.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.276
- I'm not dressed.
- Okay.

35:06.040 --> 35:10.353
Got a call from the label,
from that P.R... bitch.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.915
- You want to hear about it?
- Is it bad?

35:12.960 --> 35:15.634
- You gonna let me in?
- Ellie's getting dressed.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.911
- They shopped it around to radio.
- And what?

35:17.960 --> 35:22.034
And you did it. She says "Alive" and
"Hologram" tested in the mid-90s.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.992
What about
the other ones?

35:24.040 --> 35:26.016
They did fine, I think,
but you got two, for Christ sake.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.430
You needed exactly one
to work.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.477
You don't seem excited.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.637
Well, you don't seem
very excited either.

35:32.680 --> 35:35.070
I'm thrilled.
Just didn't come as much of a surprise.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.998
A & R is sending through
a list of their acts

35:37.040 --> 35:39.396
they think you can open for
in the spring.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.456
- I can't believe it.
- Listen, I'm sending you home for a week or two.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.056
I want you to rest up,
'cause guess what?

35:43.080 --> 35:44.878
I'm taking you to Stockholm
after the break.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.479
- Really?
- It's in Europe.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.591
- I know.
- They want enough tracks for an album.

35:48.640 --> 35:51.075
I want you working with this guy.
The best.

35:51.120 --> 35:52.918
You'll know his stuff
when you hear it.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.520
He's written everything.
Hits.

35:55.560 --> 35:58.040
I told him, make space for you.
He said okay if we come to him.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.914
- Oh.
- So whatever you got... half-written,

36:00.960 --> 36:03.600
ideas, whatever you got...
let's go lay it down.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.639
You hear that, Ellie?

36:06.680 --> 36:09.832
See? I told you
you'd get really big.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.216
Following a short
visit home with their parents,

36:14.240 --> 36:17.074
Celeste's manager had
the girls' passports expedited,

36:17.120 --> 36:19.635
and the three of them
set flight for an unfamiliar

36:19.680 --> 36:22.514
if not particularly exotic
foreign city,

36:22.560 --> 36:26.474
where they would go on to have
many uniquely first experiences.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.000
Stockholm was home
to what business scholars

36:31.040 --> 36:34.033
and economic geographers call
an industry cluster,

36:34.080 --> 36:37.118
an agglomeration of talent,
business infrastructure,

36:37.160 --> 36:39.231
and competing firms
all swirling around

36:39.280 --> 36:41.476
one industry in one place.

36:41.520 --> 36:44.957
In the 1940s, church leaders
and cultural conservatives

36:45.000 --> 36:47.674
rallied together around
a solemn mission:

36:47.720 --> 36:51.077
to safeguard the country's youth
against the degenerate music

36:51.120 --> 36:53.635
that was being piped in
from America.

36:53.680 --> 36:58.072
To combat this threat, municipal schools
of music spread across the country,

36:58.120 --> 37:01.557
offering morally uplifting
instruction in classical music.

37:01.600 --> 37:05.116
One thing would eventually
to another.

37:05.200 --> 37:08.193
Born at the height
of this morally uplifting boom

37:08.240 --> 37:10.311
at the close
of the second war,

37:10.360 --> 37:13.990
Swedish producer Tor Erik
Romstad was initially skeptical

37:14.040 --> 37:17.590
but grew increasingly fond
of the inseparable sisters.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.280
And though he considered
himself a beat-up old atheist

37:20.320 --> 37:24.030
that had been phoning it in for
some time in the pop music game,

37:24.080 --> 37:27.312
he found the girls'
kind-hearted devotion to God,

37:27.360 --> 37:30.159
music, and most importantly,
one another,

37:30.200 --> 37:32.760
to be altogether inspiring.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.235
Over the course of five weeks,
he would turn out

37:35.280 --> 37:39.638
some of his career's most
addictive hooks and melodies.

37:39.680 --> 37:43.037
So far oblivious to the
impending deluge of notoriety

37:43.080 --> 37:45.390
these tracks would
soon afford her,

37:45.440 --> 37:46.920
Celeste primarily enjoyed
getting

37:46.960 --> 37:49.600
all this one-on-one time
with Eleanor.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.916
They never could've dreamed
they would one day

37:51.960 --> 37:53.792
casually travel
to Europe together,

37:53.840 --> 37:57.151
unsupervised and unattended.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.556
On weekends,
Eleanor enjoyed

37:59.600 --> 38:02.513
playing the role of the big
sister by taking Celeste around

38:02.560 --> 38:05.758
to the nearby bars
and local dance clubs.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.440
Before the massacre
at New Brighton,

38:08.480 --> 38:11.917
Eleanor might never have dared to
share these more disgraceful aspects

38:11.960 --> 38:15.317
of her recreational appetites
with her young sibling.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.149
But considering all the
suffering Celeste had endured,

38:19.200 --> 38:21.840
she was surely
old enough now to engage

38:21.880 --> 38:24.952
in the more pleasurable parts
of adulthood also.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.438
Celeste felt alive,
creative, and autonomous,

38:29.480 --> 38:32.632
in command
of her own destiny.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.790
Baby,
he's calling again.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.877
We're gonna miss
our flight.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.479
It's so early.

38:48.520 --> 38:51.479
Tell him I don't think
I can get on a plane.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.280
I don't believe this shit.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.670
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.235
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, don't say you're sorry.

39:08.280 --> 39:11.432
Just don't do it.

39:11.480 --> 39:14.837
It's the same old shit with
all you kids over and over.

39:14.880 --> 39:18.715
Your parents trusted me.
I take that seriously.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.274
Are you smiling?

39:20.320 --> 39:22.755
Are you smiling?
Don't smile at me.

39:22.800 --> 39:25.634
It's just that you're funny.
Don't yell at me.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.353
I'll stop yelling
when you wipe

39:27.400 --> 39:30.154
that condescending beam
off your face.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.556
Guess what?
Since you two both

39:32.640 --> 39:35.474
decided to completely fuck off
and do whatever you please,

39:35.520 --> 39:39.116
with zero consideration for what a
terrible position you put me in...

39:39.160 --> 39:42.073
morally, ethically,
legally...

39:42.120 --> 39:44.919
from now on,
I veto your request,

39:44.960 --> 39:48.715
and will swear and fuckin'
curse as much as I please.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.638
'Cause guess what?
I'm not buying

39:50.680 --> 39:53.673
this innocent little girl
shit you two are selling.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.871
Fine. It's a deal.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.593
Just stop yelling.

39:57.640 --> 40:00.872
I'm obviously
not yelling.

40:00.960 --> 40:04.954
You have 12 hours to lie knocked out
on a plane and get your act together.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.469
And what?
Think about what I've done?

40:07.520 --> 40:10.115
I called your room
10 times.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.557
What happens in 12 hours?

40:16.960 --> 40:20.032
- Going to L.A. to make a video.
- What?

42:40.200 --> 42:42.669
Did you enjoy
the show?

42:42.720 --> 42:45.713
- What?
- Did you like the show?

42:45.760 --> 42:48.195
Oh, sorry.
I actually just got here.

42:48.240 --> 42:50.197
He's your manager?

42:51.440 --> 42:54.114
How did you guys
connect?

42:54.160 --> 42:56.311
He saw me sing on TV.

42:56.360 --> 42:57.999
Oh, I'm Celeste.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.316
Can I get you a drink,
Celeste?

43:00.360 --> 43:02.591
No, I'm good, thanks.

43:02.640 --> 43:05.439
I have to work
early tomorrow.

43:05.480 --> 43:07.711
I'm making a video.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.831
Are you in it?

43:09.880 --> 43:11.837
Well, I hope so.

43:11.880 --> 43:14.031
It's a video
for a song I made.

43:14.080 --> 43:16.197
Well, what kind of music
do you make?

43:16.280 --> 43:19.079
- I'm embarrassed to say.
- Why?

43:19.120 --> 43:21.157
I don't want you
to make fun of me.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.396
I'm not gonna
make fun of you.

43:23.440 --> 43:24.794
Pop music.

43:24.840 --> 43:26.832
Ah, I love pop music.

43:26.880 --> 43:29.634
- No you don't.
- Of course I do. Who doesn't love pop music?

43:29.680 --> 43:32.878
What are you doing? Let's go back.
I want you to meet somebody.

43:32.920 --> 43:35.515
- I know your brother.
- Yeah, we've met around.

43:35.560 --> 43:36.960
Yeah. Celeste.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.559
Are you all right?

43:40.600 --> 43:42.637
I've taken a load
of pills before the set

43:42.680 --> 43:44.990
'cause I was nervous,

43:45.040 --> 43:46.872
and I think
I need some new stuff

43:46.920 --> 43:49.276
to counteract
the old stuff.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.198
Do you have any drugs
in the room?

43:51.240 --> 43:53.391
Only painkillers.

43:53.440 --> 43:55.875
Oh. Okay.

43:55.920 --> 43:58.879
I have to go back downstairs
and get a new key.

43:58.920 --> 44:00.832
I think I grabbed
my sister's.

44:09.600 --> 44:11.876
That is nice.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.231
I love this shit.

44:24.200 --> 44:25.953
Yeah.

44:39.600 --> 44:43.196
This is brilliant.
This is, like, the best song I've ever heard.

44:43.240 --> 44:45.152
Shut up.

44:45.200 --> 44:47.954
You left out
a drop and crawl.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.560
I'm not doing that.

44:50.600 --> 44:51.875
You do it.

44:51.920 --> 44:55.630
Fine. I will.

44:55.680 --> 44:58.036
Get off my stage.

45:00.560 --> 45:03.871
Stop. Oh, God.

45:07.080 --> 45:08.833
Stop! Stop!

45:11.040 --> 45:12.713
You make
the same sort of music

45:12.760 --> 45:15.514
the boy who attacked me
used to listen to.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.190
Does that remind you
of him?

45:21.680 --> 45:23.990
It did, just this moment.

45:26.360 --> 45:29.319
I hope that doesn't
upset you too much.

45:31.400 --> 45:32.834
It doesn't.

45:35.320 --> 45:39.280
I think when you meet someone who's going
to become an important figure in your life,

45:39.320 --> 45:43.837
that... it forces us
to look back at the past

45:43.880 --> 45:47.396
so we can get on
with the future, is all.

45:51.640 --> 45:54.030
In my defense,

45:54.080 --> 45:57.915
maybe it was the thing that
pushed that kid over the edge,

45:57.960 --> 46:01.078
or... maybe it was
the only thing

46:01.120 --> 46:04.511
that could've saved him and
all those other poor kids.

46:06.320 --> 46:09.916
Anyhow,
I'm glad I'm already important to you.

46:12.600 --> 46:15.399
I don't like to
think about it

46:15.440 --> 46:18.000
or talk about it.

46:18.040 --> 46:20.430
Why would you?
I mean,

46:20.480 --> 46:22.676
what is there
to talk about?

46:26.240 --> 46:29.916
That's what I love
about pop music.

46:29.960 --> 46:33.715
I don't want people to
have to think too hard.

46:33.760 --> 46:36.355
I just want them
to feel good.

46:41.360 --> 46:44.353
Ever since it happened,

46:44.400 --> 46:46.915
I have the same dream
every night.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.393
Tell me.

46:53.640 --> 46:55.677
In my dream, I'm speeding
through a tunnel

46:55.720 --> 46:58.838
that doesn't seem to end.

46:58.880 --> 47:02.635
I'm late to meet someone
at the other side.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.677
And every time I turn

47:06.760 --> 47:09.719
these wide bends in the road,

47:09.760 --> 47:12.480
I drive past a body,

47:12.520 --> 47:14.796
but I don't stop for it.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.993
Dead body?

47:20.000 --> 47:21.798
Not exactly,

47:23.120 --> 47:24.600
but...

47:26.760 --> 47:28.672
lifeless.

47:33.040 --> 47:34.554
After a while,

47:34.600 --> 47:38.992
I realize that they're
these doubles of me,

47:39.040 --> 47:41.271
like clones,

47:41.320 --> 47:44.836
that I've tried to send
down the tunnel in my place.

47:44.880 --> 47:49.193
But they never made it
to the other side.

47:49.240 --> 47:51.436
They're never the same age.

47:53.320 --> 47:56.757
They're always laid out
in different configurations.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.239
Makes sense.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.912
Does it?

48:04.440 --> 48:06.477
Sure.

48:06.520 --> 48:10.036
I mean,
you almost died.

48:10.080 --> 48:12.037
So...

48:12.080 --> 48:15.630
now it's easy to imagine
yourself dead at any age.

48:18.440 --> 48:21.592
I don't think that's
what it's about, because...

48:21.640 --> 48:24.200
in my dream,
I know that I will never die.

48:28.920 --> 48:31.480
What's at the end
of the tunnel?

48:34.720 --> 48:37.519
I always wake up
before I get there.

48:39.720 --> 48:42.155
But I'm so frightened,
because...

48:42.200 --> 48:45.079
I'm going somewhere
where no one can find me

48:45.120 --> 48:47.237
and no one knows my name.

49:24.040 --> 49:26.157
Wake up!

49:26.200 --> 49:28.112
What are you doing
in here?

49:28.160 --> 49:32.552
You got to wake up.
We have to call Mom and Dad.

49:32.600 --> 49:34.990
Where's the remote?

49:35.040 --> 49:38.033
A plane crashed into
a building in New York.

49:38.120 --> 49:39.793

50:55.680 --> 50:57.478
Haunted by the ephemeral image

50:57.520 --> 51:00.479
of her sister and manager's
nocturnal encounter,

51:00.520 --> 51:04.116
wrestling feelings
of betrayal and exclusion,

51:04.160 --> 51:05.913
Celeste's loss of innocence

51:05.960 --> 51:08.600
curiously mirrored
that of the nation.

51:10.520 --> 51:13.080
From that day forth,
the girls' paths diverged,

51:13.120 --> 51:15.396
and the two sisters
were forcefully pushed towards

51:15.440 --> 51:18.751
opposing severities
of their characters.

51:18.800 --> 51:21.076
One for the money,
two for the show,

51:21.120 --> 51:24.158
three to get ready,
and four we go.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.394
Cut. Good.

52:42.240 --> 52:44.994
In the year 2017,

52:45.040 --> 52:47.430
Celeste would be
31 years old,

52:47.480 --> 52:49.995
prisoner of a gaudy
and unlivable present,

52:50.040 --> 52:52.953
which had reached
an extreme of its cycle,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.469
and there was no imagining
what new forms

52:55.520 --> 52:58.399
it, or she, may assume.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.040
Where are you going?

53:11.080 --> 53:12.639
For a smoke.
She's with makeup.

53:12.680 --> 53:14.911
- Is she dressed?
- Hair wanted her.

53:14.960 --> 53:16.952
Round tables
start at 1:00.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.560
That's not on me.
40 minutes late.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.600
Hey, how's she look?

53:23.640 --> 53:25.313
Tired.

53:28.240 --> 53:30.914
You look beautiful.

53:30.960 --> 53:34.112
I think it's enough of a
statement with the brows.

53:34.160 --> 53:36.595
I think we should stop
fussing with them now.

53:39.960 --> 53:41.838
How we doing in here?

53:41.880 --> 53:43.758
20 minutes.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.553
Good. Celeste,

53:45.600 --> 53:47.796
I need to speak with you
before we start today.

53:47.840 --> 53:50.560
- What is it?
- It's better in private.

53:50.600 --> 53:55.117
Toni doesn't care.
What is it?

53:56.160 --> 53:58.277
There's, uh...

54:01.560 --> 54:03.358
There's been a shooting...

54:03.400 --> 54:05.915
they think it's terrorism...
in a beach town

54:05.960 --> 54:07.599
called Brac in Croatia.

54:07.680 --> 54:09.520
- Do we know someone who got hurt?
- No, no, no.

54:09.560 --> 54:12.200
Of course not.
No, no, no. Don't worry.

54:12.240 --> 54:15.472
We don't have much information,
but 14 people are dead,

54:15.520 --> 54:18.558
- and, uh, more are injured...
- Hey.

54:18.600 --> 54:21.776
No one is gonna think we are insensitive
for playing a gig halfway around the world.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.075
It's not that.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.839
Okay, well, who did it?

54:24.880 --> 54:26.997
Far as I know,
nobody's claimed responsibility.

54:27.040 --> 54:28.235
- Uh...
- Let me finish.

54:28.280 --> 54:30.920
- Okay.
- The shooters

54:30.960 --> 54:34.840
were all wearing masks
from our "Hologram" video.

54:34.880 --> 54:36.758
- What?
- They came out in masks

54:36.800 --> 54:38.712
and started shooting people
at a beach resort.

54:38.760 --> 54:40.911
We don't know
if it was organized

54:40.960 --> 54:44.112
or just a one-off thing.

54:45.360 --> 54:46.840
How similar?

54:46.880 --> 54:50.476
That's as much as I know.

54:50.520 --> 54:53.991
You're gonna get a lot of questions about
it today. I want you to be prepared.

54:54.040 --> 54:57.556
- Can we call off the press?
- Probably not without calling off tonight too.

54:57.600 --> 55:00.798
Josie says it'd be bad
to avoid it anyway.

55:00.840 --> 55:02.479
Okay.

55:04.680 --> 55:06.911
People are going to be
on your side.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.919
We just got to face it head-on
and, you know,

55:09.960 --> 55:13.032
be astute in our response.

55:13.120 --> 55:15.874
I'm making arrangements to hold a
press conference downstairs at 4:00.

55:15.920 --> 55:17.559
- A press conference?
- Yeah.

55:17.600 --> 55:19.456
- Are you kidding me?
- It'll take five minutes.

55:19.480 --> 55:21.790
I called Josie, I told her
I want her here with us

55:21.880 --> 55:24.679
to prepare a statement now.

55:24.720 --> 55:27.315
Has anyone heard from Albertine?
My phone's dead.

55:27.360 --> 55:29.238
Albertine is in the
restaurant having lunch.

55:29.280 --> 55:30.919
I'm taking you to
see them right now.

55:30.960 --> 55:32.519
Is she mad at me?

55:32.560 --> 55:34.870
Why would she be mad at you?
She's excited to be here.

55:34.920 --> 55:37.594
I pushed roundtables
until after press assembly.

55:37.640 --> 55:40.872
That allows us time for a
few more details to pour in.

55:40.920 --> 55:44.630
But the gist I have so far is,
it might all be a coincidence.

55:44.680 --> 55:48.276
- What do you mean, a coincidence?
- I don't know.

55:48.320 --> 55:51.392
They stopped at a costume store
and picked up the first disguise

55:51.440 --> 55:53.591
or whatever you want to
call it that they saw.

55:53.640 --> 55:56.917
But the article SRK sent over
purports that the gunmen

55:56.960 --> 55:59.429
were exploiting your image
and body of work as a symbol

55:59.480 --> 56:02.518
of moral corruption in the
West or something lunatic.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.950
- Ah, great.
- Given your history,

56:05.000 --> 56:07.720
I think we should try and view
this as an opportunity to speak

56:07.800 --> 56:11.430
to some of your most important
beliefs and positions.

56:11.480 --> 56:14.040
I don't know about that.
In all likelihood,

56:14.080 --> 56:17.437
her history is the reason
they decided to target her.

56:17.480 --> 56:20.393
Now, from the outset,
you have to make it clear

56:20.480 --> 56:24.440
that the reason that you are not
canceling tonight or any upcoming dates

56:24.480 --> 56:27.314
is because there isn't enough
information yet to justify canceling.

56:27.360 --> 56:29.352
- Right.
- Keep it focused

56:29.400 --> 56:32.234
on your outpour of love
and mourning for the victims

56:32.280 --> 56:34.795
and victims of violence
all over the world.

56:37.680 --> 56:39.956
Nobody would blame you,
but don't say anything rash.

56:40.040 --> 56:43.351
I don't want anyone to misconstrue
what you're really trying to say.

56:43.400 --> 56:46.279
- Everyone out there will feel for you.
- Yeah.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.551
Just speak
from the heart.

56:48.600 --> 56:50.398
I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

56:52.200 --> 56:55.876
No, it's just my meds.
My spine feels like daggers.

56:55.920 --> 57:00.278
I'll get the masseuse to swing
by straight after the show.

57:00.320 --> 57:02.551
- Hello.
- I'm gonna greet everyone

57:02.600 --> 57:04.736
and get us set up and meet you
back down here in an hour.

57:04.760 --> 57:07.798
- Are they in the restaurant?
- Yeah, I'll call... There they are.

57:07.840 --> 57:11.151
Ah.
There you are!

57:11.200 --> 57:14.113
Why didn't you guys
come up to the green room?

57:14.200 --> 57:15.520
Hey, Mom.

57:15.560 --> 57:17.995
Hi, baby.

57:18.040 --> 57:19.633
Hey, Ellie.

57:19.680 --> 57:21.478
Oh, you look tired.

57:21.520 --> 57:23.352
Want to come up to my room
and take a nap?

57:23.400 --> 57:25.357
- No, I'm really hungry.
- Okay.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.756
She wouldn't eat anything
I ordered for her down here.

57:27.800 --> 57:29.359
I don't blame you.

57:29.400 --> 57:31.312
I had room service
for breakfast. It's awful.

57:31.360 --> 57:33.795
- No, it's not that. I get carsick.
- She gets carsick.

57:33.840 --> 57:36.400
Ah. Okay. Well, did you
have any fun at all?

57:36.440 --> 57:40.275
- I showed her around our hometown.
- Hey. How are you?

57:40.320 --> 57:43.154
- Things are the same in our world.
- It's good to see you, kiddo.

57:43.200 --> 57:44.873
How's Grandma and Grandpa?

57:44.920 --> 57:47.151
Grandma wants to change
their tickets to tomorrow.

57:47.200 --> 57:50.477
Why? I mean,
it's practically across the street from them.

57:53.400 --> 57:56.313
Okay, I'll call her.

57:56.360 --> 57:58.317
- How'd it go?
- What?

57:58.360 --> 57:59.999
- The conference.
- Oh.

58:03.840 --> 58:05.957
I know. Let's not talk
about it now.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.798
What's wrong?

58:07.840 --> 58:10.309
None of your business.
Grownup problems. Don't worry about it.

58:10.360 --> 58:12.431
Hey, baby, you want to
get some lunch with me?

58:12.480 --> 58:16.394
Can I take Alby for
a quick solo girls' lunch?

58:16.440 --> 58:18.636
Of course,
but I need you back by 4:00

58:18.680 --> 58:20.194
so we can get ready
for the show.

58:20.240 --> 58:23.039
- All right.
- She has to be back by 3:30.

58:23.080 --> 58:25.072
Thank you, Ellie.

58:25.120 --> 58:27.496
Can you stick around the hotel, please?
I got to go upstairs...

58:27.520 --> 58:31.070
- I got to get out of here...
- Fine! Take security.

58:31.120 --> 58:34.158
I don't need a babysitter.
I'm gonna walk Alby down the street.

58:34.200 --> 58:37.238
Yeah, down the street.
Please be back by 3:30.

58:37.280 --> 58:41.240
All right. You take a nap.
I'll bring her back after lunch.

58:41.280 --> 58:44.239
- What do you want to eat?
- Mm, I don't know.

58:44.280 --> 58:47.079
What do you mean, you don't know?
Of course you know.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.840
I hate talking to kids
these days.

58:49.920 --> 58:53.152
They always say they "don't know"
about everything. Are you depressed or what?

58:53.200 --> 58:55.556
No.

58:55.600 --> 58:58.256
Listen, I'm just teasing. I'm just
trying to get you to relax around me.

58:58.280 --> 59:00.192
I am relaxed.
I'm just uncomfortable

59:00.240 --> 59:03.233
because there are so many
people looking at us.

59:06.120 --> 59:09.511
Listen, there's gonna be paparazzis outside
'cause everyone knows we're here.

59:09.560 --> 59:11.631
- You want to go out the back?
- No.

59:11.680 --> 59:13.672
I'll just walk
ahead of you.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.791
Celeste? Celeste!

59:24.840 --> 59:27.196
Hey, man,
please don't follow me.

59:27.240 --> 59:29.118
What are your feelings
on today's attack?

59:29.160 --> 59:31.356
Listen, I'm going to lunch.
I'll be back in 45 minutes.

59:31.400 --> 59:34.040
You can take as many pictures
of me as you want then, okay?

59:34.080 --> 59:35.639
Thank you. Jeez!

59:35.680 --> 59:39.151
- Hey, slow down.
- I hate those people.

59:39.200 --> 59:42.352
Everybody hates those people.
Don't even worry about it.

59:42.400 --> 59:44.357
You should've let them
take a picture of you.

59:44.400 --> 59:47.757
- You look so beautiful today.
- No, I don't.

59:47.800 --> 59:50.360
I haven't washed my hair,
and I barely have any makeup on.

59:50.440 --> 59:52.159
You want me to give you
some of mine?

59:52.200 --> 59:54.590
I woke up looking like
a pterodactyl today.

59:54.640 --> 59:57.280
That's the thanks you get
for giving the gift of life.

59:57.320 --> 59:59.516
No good deed
goes unpunished.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.871
You know, the little babies, they just
suck the lifeblood right out of you.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.957
Shut up.
You look great, Mom.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.753
Thank Christ for that.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.269
Better off than some of
these other girls I meet.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.630
- Like who?
- Not telling.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.514
- Why? What's wrong with them?
- Nothing, really. It's just, you know,

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.155
when I flip through these magazines,
I see these girls I know,

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.398
and half the time, I've seen them
naked in a dressing room or whatever,

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:24.116
so I know where they have an ugly birthmark
or where they got their tail cut off.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.200
- Who has a tail?
- Don't look so excited. I'm not telling you.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.896
I mean, I wouldn't want someone to
spread that kind of personal stuff

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.038
around about me,
you know?

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.072
This place isn't bad.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.871
Well, it's nice to sit
with somebody

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.720
who doesn't have their face
buried in a phone.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.798
Me and Ellie don't do
phones at the table.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.038
That's cool.
You should listen to her.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.595
I do listen to her.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.896
But if she's so cool,
then why do you hate having her around?

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.391
I don't hate having her around.
I just wanted some alone time with you.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.753
You act like you hate her.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.235
That's an ugly thing to say.
Don't say that.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.910
Not saying you actually hate her.
Just saying you act like it.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.478
Look, sometimes
I got a short fuse

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.637
because I don't get
a lot of sleep

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.990
and I've got a lot of stuff
on my plate.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.236
There's no money
in music anymore.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.717
It's all branded content
or virtual reality, reality TV.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.356
I mean, I do a voice for a video
game character, for Christ sakes,

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.360
and I make more money in an afternoon
than I do all year on tour.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.120
Then why do you leave us
and go on tour for so long?

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.959
I got a lot of people to pay...
more people than you can imagine.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.834
It's a full-time job.
It's like I'm connected

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.556
to the whole world all the time,
and I can hear everyone in my head.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.069
I thought we were talking
about Aunt Ellie.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.874
What do you want
to talk about?

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.472
- Is she okay?
- She's upset you don't ever try and see her.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.910
She told you that?

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.241
That really pisses me off
that she's bringing our problems

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.789
into my relationship
with you.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.595
That has nothing to do with you.
You got that? Nothing.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.200
What problems
do you have with her?

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.596
You have everything
she ever wanted.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.552
That's ridiculous!

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.353
- I'm serious.
- Oh, God.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.710
When we went to visit Grandpa,
he even showed us a video

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.310
of Aunt Ellie singing and dancing
when you guys were little.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.116
Hey, what can I say,
you know?

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.356
Your Aunt Ellie
has too many scruples,

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.711
and sometimes life
just isn't that fair.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.320
Especially not nowadays.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.353
Now people will try
and sell you anything...

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.911
a TV monitor that plain as day
looks like shit,

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.954
but they tout it as "ultra mega
triple hi-def" whatever.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.276
Their business model
relies on

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.040
their customer's
unshakable stupidity.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.436
And deep down,
we probably sense that...

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.075
their intimate knowledge
of our commitment

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.840
to the lowest common
denominator.

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.111
It's the official
manifestation

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.755
of the increasingly
important urge

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.992
to break with every living thing that
has some connection to the past.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.760
- What?
- When we weren't paying attention,

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.110
everyone got together
and they voted

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.516
that traditions of the past
are ugly.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.992
The past reeks too much
of ugly old people and death.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.952
So Mama's got to stay fresh.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.356
- Okay.
- You know, I'm pretty sure

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.359
that every year my videos
keep getting worse and worse,

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.596
but they're doing
better and better.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.678
They showed me this perfume
thing we shot last year

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.509
where I'm unfurling from a digital
rose petal like Thumbelina,

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.029
and I thought
it would ruin me,

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.151
but here I am,
opening for 30,000.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.396
Mom, what are you even
talking about?

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.150
I'm letting you in on a little secret
because I love you, that's what.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.079
It doesn't matter anymore
if you're Michelangelo

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.430
or if you're Mikey and Angelo
from New Brighton.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.879
And Aunt Ellie
never found her angle.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.800
And then she decided to go get
jealous of my good fortune.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.752
She made
her own choices.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.235
And let me tell you,
she could never do

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.715
what I do
day in and day out.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.320
But luckily, she gets to
go home to you every night,

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.336
and she doesn't have any
real-world responsibilities

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.794
'cause I finance
her entire life.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.117
- Quiet.
- Don't tell me to be quiet.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.117
No, I don't mean it
like that.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.119
Isn't that your song?

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.278
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'll go ask them to turn it off.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.318
Excuse me. Would you mind
turning off the music, please?

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.556
I'm about to order lunch,
I'm trying to talk to my kid.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.398
I just keep hearing
my voice in the head.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.160
Yeah, sorry. My manager
told me to put it on.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.317
Okay.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.159
Could you bring me a drink
and maybe a soda for her?

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.318
- What do you want?
- Oh, a glass of white wine.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.551
Whatever you have
that isn't gross.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.274
And if you could put it in
a plastic cup or something.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.232
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.237
I'm sorry to
rag on Aunt Ellie.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.317
I know she's doing her best.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.273
It's just, I'm having a shit day,
and I'm taking it out on her.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.073
Better her than me.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.635
I never
take it out on you.

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.875
Okay.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.833
I don't, do I?

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.599
Ah, God!

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.832
Well, if I do,
I don't mean to.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.031
I'm sor...

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.111
I'm sorry.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.470
You know,
sometimes you just...

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.796
you think it can't get
any worse, and then you just...

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:33.119
you get diagnosed
with fucking cancer.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.072
What?
Mom, are you sick?

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.033
I don't mean literally.
I just...

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:41.238
You know, sometimes you just
get kicked while you're down.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.074
- Oh, God, I shouldn't do this in front of you.
- It's fine.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.680
No, it's not. I would
slap me across the face

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.679
if I was sitting
across from me right now.

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:55.031
- Really, it's fine.
- Dan left me.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.873
Yeah, I know.
I read about it.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.798
You know?

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.400
Aunt Ellie's not supposed to
let you read that gossip shit.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.557
She can't control
everything I do like a watchdog.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.195
You know what? I wanted to tell you.
I keep feeling like

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.994
big moments get stolen
away from me.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.952
Mom, it's fine.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.117
I don't care
about that guy.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:17.198
I thought you loved Dan.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.799
Yeah, he was fine.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.639
I was just nice to him
because he was nice to you.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.558
Here we are.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.637
Do you guys know what
you want to order yet?

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.240
You know, we could use a couple
more minutes with the menu.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.078
I'll just have
the pasta with marinara.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.794
Do you want me to put that in,
or do you want me to wait?

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.976
That's okay. You can just bring her.
I don't need anything.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.231
You just bring her pasta.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.472
Why did he leave you?

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.910
- Who said he left me?
- You did.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.759
Well, he didn't.
We left each other.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:49.589
Because when you love something,
you give it away.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.675
Is he seeing
someone else?

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.439
- Is that what you read?
- Yeah.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.040
Said he started dating
some rich girl.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.318
I don't know.
That's not what he told me.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.750
But I bet
it's just a fling.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.431
I mean, I've had flings I wouldn't
want anyone to judge my character by.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.598
- Drinks okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.235
I'm the manager here,
so if you need anything, let me know.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.954
Will do, thanks.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.959
Um, hey, do you mind if
I get a quick picture with you?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.232
Now is not
the best time.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.317
It's not for public use
or anything.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.896
- It'll just take a minute.
- Is this what you want a picture with?

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.877
I'm trying to talk
to my daughter.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.696
I'm sorry, you don't have to
use that tone with me.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.677
I think I asked you
very nicely.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.616
You don't have to be so upset.
It's just a picture.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.576
- Are you fucking serious, man?
- Please don't use that language.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.592
How dare you,
motherfucker?

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.120
Alison, can you call
the police?

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.958
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.679
I could ask you
the same question.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.656
I can smell the alcohol
on your breath, by the way.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.816
Are you trying to embarrass me
in front of my daughter?

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.479
I didn't even know
you had a daughter.

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.696
I just came up to be friendly,
and you started yelling at me.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.616
Now I'm asking you to leave the restaurant,
or I'm going to call the cops.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.074
Let's just go.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.032
You should be ashamed
of yourself, prick.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.951
Oh, Jesus.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.957
You know what?
Let's go down this way

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.038
so we don't have to deal with
all those shitheads out front.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.919
Look, I'm really sorry
I lost my cool on that guy.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.429
He was asking for it,
but I don't want to talk about it.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:20.711
Baby, you're all
shook up.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:23.149
Look, that kind of thing
doesn't happen all the time,

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.840
but sometimes it does,
and I got to protect myself.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.633
I said I don't want
to talk about it.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.274
But baby, we got to
talk about it,

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:34.029
'cause if we don't,
it just hangs in the air.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.151
I'm worried about you.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.395
You're worried
about me?

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:41.194
You don't need to worry about me.
I'm solid.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:44.551
I worry about you.
Baby, that's my job... to worry about you.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:47.394
- You're skinnier than I am!
- Oh, come on.

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:49.671
That's 'cause I'm in great shape
'cause I go out

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.279
dancing my ass off
every night.

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:54.232
Come on, baby.

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:56.875
You're breaking my heart.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.877
Listen,
what that guy said before

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.832
about me having alcohol
on my breath,

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.759
that was a terrible thing
to imply in front of you.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.269
And instead of just ignoring
the elephant in the room,

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:08.755
let's talk about it
head-on.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.474
I ordered a glass of wine
from them in a plastic cup

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.194
'cause I need to let go of some
tension I'm having about tonight,

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.392
and I didn't want you to think
there was anything to worry about.

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:19.352
But I swear on my life

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:22.631
I had nothing to drink
before that today, okay?

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.996
It's nothing
to worry about.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.750
In 2011,
Celeste had drunk herself blind...

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.359
or more precisely,
blind in one eye.

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:34.950
She'd waited to tell a physician
about the trouble she'd been having,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.674
too embarrassed to explain
that while touring

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.519
the less inhabited,
and therefore less inhibited

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.439
parts of the southern
United States,

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.995
she had damaged
the optic nerve in her left eye

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.477
by ingesting various forms
of methanol during a stint

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.194
of binge-drinking
household cleaning products

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.436
across three state lines.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.200
Shortly thereafter,
once back at home,

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.278
she found herself at the center
of a very public dispute

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.551
as the result
of a traffic collision

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.674
and one unlucky pedestrian's
crushed left leg and pelvis.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.632
Adding insult to injury,

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.592
Celeste accosted
the pedestrian

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.872
in a string of uncharacteristic
racial slurs.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.560
The victim of this short-lived
episode in her life

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.637
saw an opportunity
and seized it.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.672
That golden ticket came
in the form

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.189
of a nearly 13-million-dollar
settlement,

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.511
all just another flame
in the crowd

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:29.031
of what Celeste perceived
as a decade-long witch hunt.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:32.118
What is it, baby?
Is something else on your mind?

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.117
It's nothing.

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.720
Stop it.
What is it?

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.956
Albertine
had lost her virginity

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.357
the weekend prior to leaving
for this first unveiling

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.916
of Celeste's 6th studio
recording, Vox Lux,

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.715
and yearned to share the galvanizing
details with her mother.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.231
She had made herself sick with
anticipation every day since

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.353
or sense of failure
it might inspire in Celeste,

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.072
had always spoken
severely of young men,

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.430
even warning of them
more than mixing

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.154
uppers with downers,
for example.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.398
If all went according to plan,
the news might just

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.359
strike up a long-misplaced
maternal instinct,

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:20.996
and Celeste would be forced
to act as her confidant.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.599
That was fast.
Where's Albertine?

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.758
Oh, she's up in my room
taking a pregnancy test,

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.269
'cause apparently you're so
fucking incompetent

01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.280
you let her get fucked
by some hick from town.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.631
- She's pregnant?
- Unless she inherited my bad luck, probably not.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.593
But I wanted her to feel the
unease of waiting for that result,

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.996
because a parent,
or a legal guardian,

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.430
disciplines their kid,
they don't just hang out.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.279
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.154
You fucked up. Twice.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.910
- I know you're mad but...
- How could I be so stupid?

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.917
You know?

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:28.034
You did so badly by me,
why would I expect you to do right by her?

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.595
I knew she was seeing a guy,
but it...

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.950
it didn't seem physical,
I swear.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.992
You a retard?

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.236
No.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.272
'Cause sometimes your jaw
slacks in a certain way,

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.516
where you look like
life's just happening to you.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.632
You look like
a retard.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.433
Please don't say that
about me.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.360
Only crazy people get aggravated
when you call them crazy.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.995
So you must really
be retarded.

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:59.390
- I don't understand how you can hate me so much.
- Oh, I hate you?

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.875
Is that the kind of garbage
you've been putting in her head?

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.153
'Cause she told me all the shit
you've been putting on her shoulders.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.715
You ungrateful sow.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.639
I have a press conference
and two hours of roundtables,

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.354
but I swear to God, Ellie,
if my daughter

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.232
comes back to me pregnant

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:19.114
with some cross-eyed Guido's
kitten litter

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.755
or Hepatitis Z, I will
throw you off that balcony.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.679
After everything
I've done for you both!

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.598
After everything
you've done for us?

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.039
Good job.
You've done it.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.072
Done what?

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.998
You've hurt me.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.191
Embarrassed me.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.358
I have dedicated my whole life
to "Celeste,"

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.193
and I'll continue
to do so,

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:50.075
but if you threaten me
ever again,

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.715
I'll remind the world
that I raised her child

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.831
and that I write her songs.

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.675
Touché.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.316
but today, that's a stock
I wouldn't buy into.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.079
You can say
whatever you'd want.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:10.192
In this day and age,
who'd care?

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.678
In this meditation,

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.554
we're going to play with
the idea of motivation.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.195
- Work can sometimes feel a bit flat.
- Celeste?

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.836
Hey, Is she awake?

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.833
Celeste?

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.154
Thank you.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:08.752
Hey. Hello again.
Have a great show.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.712
Have a great show.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.517
How are we doing
in here?

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.511
How we doing?

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.717
Can you believe it?

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.797
Hmm? What's that?

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:30.720
Everyone we used to answer
to works for us now.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.590
Josie...

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.360
She cares about you.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.710
You used to call her
a bitch.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.155
- You look amazing.
- What?

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.840
Keep it simple.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.792
You're gonna do great.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.952
Celeste, I just want to quickly
introduce you to Yanmei,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.957
our opener tonight,
before she heads out

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.834
- to Staten Island for sound check.
- Welcome.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.520
We are so glad
to have you.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.234
To share a stage with you,
to me,

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:17.956
is an incredible honor
and truly a dream come true.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.957
That's real nice
of you to say,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.357
but, really,
the pleasure's mine.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.791
They showed me your stuff, and I said,
"We got to get that girl."

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.351
Then I am even more touched
by your invitation.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.120
We won't keep you.
She has a rehearsal at the venue.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.072
Hope you
dig my hometown.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.715
Excuse me?

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.911
Have fun in Staten Island.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:55.150
I have an outpouring
of love

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:59.479
for victims of today's
unthinkable event

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.831
and for victims
of violence everywhere,

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.759
and I am deeply saddened
to be associated

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.589
with such an obscene
and unnecessary tragedy.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.551
It's-It's a weird world
we live in,

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.355
and I guess,
no matter how much you try

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.596
to ignore all these things

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.951
that are really happening,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.276
sometimes they just
find a way to creep in.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:28.916
Jennifer Durst, WYNN New York.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.077
Why do you think
they chose you?

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:34.272
Do you assume there's some
connection to New Brighton?

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.199
I don't know, I mean, I know
about as much as you right now,

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.800
and, um...

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.877
you know, since no one's
coming forward

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.559
and saying,
"Hey, we did this,"

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.035
I'd prefer
not to speculate.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:50.677
But if they did choose
this disguise on purpose,

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.918
I-I guess that it's because
they don't like that I'm a woman

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.839
or maybe they don't like
that I'm a successful woman.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.873
Maybe they don't like that
I had a kid when I was a kid.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.472
Maybe they think I'm a floozy.
But maybe you guys think that too.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.035
I mean, the way
I've chosen to live my life

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.914
goes against some people's
views about things.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.919
Are there any links
between you and Central Europe?

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.758
Not really.
Not that I know of.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.712
I've never
played a show there,

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.956
so I don't really know.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.640
- Next question.
- I just have one more.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.056
Are you and the band still going
forward with the show tonight?

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.720
Well, there's not
really enough information yet

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.877
to justify canceling.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:32.994
and my dad always says,
"Never postpone joy,"

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.839
so, yeah,
I'll play if they let me.

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.315
Next question.
There, at the back.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.790
Afternoon, Meredith Desh,
covering Greater Northeast.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.990
to the perpetrators
of today's attack?

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.871
Yeah.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.516
I'd like to tell them
that when I was a little girl,

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.394
I used to believe
in God too.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.750
And if they ever come
to their senses,

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.269
and they want something new
to believe in,

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.630
they can believe in me.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:06.435
'Cause I'm the new faith,
and I'm not afraid of them.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.234
Hell, I'd even like to extend
an invite to my show tonight.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.035
Josie, can you make sure to put
"cowards in masks" on the guest list.

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.640
I'm sorry,
but can you explain what you mean exactly?

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:18.479
Celeste had
been led here by example,

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.240
making loose proclamations
akin to those

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.636
made en vogue
by the government officials

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:26.912
and public representatives
of her era.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:30.158
She was frightened
and wanted to hide,

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.955
but before leaving the stage,
she would tangentially exclaim,

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.391
"I got more number-one hits
than an AK-47's

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.591
standard 30-round
magazine."

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:44.157
I don't know.
I was just making... a quip.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.398
Do you actually believe the
weird shit you said up there?

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.238
They wanted a show,
I gave 'em a show.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.556
All right, this place
is swarming with press.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.816
Can I kindly ask you both to keep your
mouths shut until we're finished?

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.638
- Fine by me.
- Let me handle it.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:57.911
Go smoke a cigarette
or something.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.959
Hello, everybody.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.437
Hello.
You have ten minutes.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.472
As we currently have
no new information

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.955
concerning what's happening
across the Atlantic,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.515
I'd ask you to keep your questions
to tonight's performance

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:20.870
and the new album
as much as possible.

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.031
Okay. Thank you.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.436
Um, well,

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.112
on that note,

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.517
can you tell us what audiences
can expect from the new album?

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:35.070
- Sci-fi anthems.
- Hmm.

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.200
The concept with this one
was to create an experience

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.596
as relentless and addictive
as possible.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.354
Fantastic.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.994
Um, so...

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.397
I know we were just asked not
talk about today's attack,

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.796
but, um,
I can't help but let it

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.674
- contextualize my next question.
- Okay.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.518
Okay.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.678
Uh, you know,
it just got me thinking,

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.837
do you feel
that there has been

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.440
a shift in the culture

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:09.076
where nihilist radical
groups like this are

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.555
increasingly keen
on being perceived

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.593
as superstars
themselves?

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:17.115
I mean, who cares?

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.880
I was hesitant to even make
a statement today,

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.674
because all these ultra-violent
thugs want is to make headlines.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:26.509
I mean, if everyone stopped
paying attention to them,

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.870
they'd cease to exist.

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.877
So would people like me,
I guess,

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.754
But that's the only link I can
really think of between me and them.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:37.271
I couldn't just ignore the casualties,
though. It makes me sick.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.800
Okay.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.355
I guess, uh, from
the public's perspective,

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.312
this has been a, I guess,

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.431
emotional few years
for you,

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.597
bizarre events today
very much included.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.916
Can you shed any light
on the significance

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:58.034
of these upcoming arena
performances for you personally?

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.720
You're kicking things off
in your hometown.

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.195
This is a culmination
of my life's work so far.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:06.278
You know, we worked on it for two years
before bringing it to the public.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.710
Why two years?

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.240
Well, the year
before that,

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.199
I was under a lot of stress
after my accident.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.717
And it's an expensive show
to put on.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.434
I wanted to make sure all the
best people became available.

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:21.233
I wanted all
my best dancers back.

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:23.511
With the decision to kick
things off in New Brighton.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:26.473
you must have considered
the event like a homecoming

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.955
resurgence since the accident
and the arrest

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.993
- for, uh, causing serious injury by dangerous driving?
- "Injury,"

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.316
not "serious injury."

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:38.798
And I never stopped making music,
so I don't consider it a resurgence.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.674
I just wanted a place to channel
all that anxiety and suffering

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.951
into something tangible,
something positive.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.710
Mm-hmm. Then can you shed any light on
why that case was abruptly dropped?

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.235
I see what you're doing.

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.630
Well, you brought it up.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.195
I'm not going to say "abruptly"
anything, okay?

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.279
Listen, there are
three classifications

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.277
of gunshot wounds
to the spine.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.336
I'm type three, which means
that the bullet is lodged

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.431
in my inter-vertebral
disc space.

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:10.598
Now, type-three injuries
are further subdivided into,

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:14.156
(a) spinal injury without
perforation of abdominal viscera;

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:17.910
(and b) spinal lesions with
perforation of abdominal organs.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.953
Now, thankfully,
I'm type A,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.913
but it's no secret that
I'm on meds for my injury,

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:27.795
and I never should've been behind
the wheel of a car that night.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:31.151
- Josie?
- I didn't mean to upset you by that.

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:34.238
I used to be treated
like I was a hero,

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.994
and then they start talking
about me like I'm trailer trash.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.713
But that's what
this show is about.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.433
- It's about rebirth.
- Time's up!

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.631
And have you at all been
in contact with the victim?

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.558
You know I can't
talk about that.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.991
I thought we were talking
about it just now, am I wrong?

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.736
Do you not think it's an insensitive
time to be bringing this up?

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.594
- Oh, come on.
- You and I, Tony, we are through.

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:55.056
- You know what? You should...
- I'm doing my job, Josie. That's it.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.960
...write about those innocent people
instead of trying to tear down

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.196
a good person
and an artist.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.756
That's not what I'm trying to do.
I'm sorry that you misunderstood.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:09.192
I'm standing everything down
until after the show.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:14.076
I want you to go to your
room and get some rest.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.840
Some rest, okay?

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:19.475
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.313
What floor
are you on?

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:26.512
One floor up.
Uh, room 910.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:29.996
Do you have my key?

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.430
- No.
- Ah, fuck.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.509
Get your hands off her.

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.675
I came up here,
she was crying by herself.

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.916
She needed a hug.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.919
Go downstairs,
get ready for the show.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.472
Come on.
Don't do that.

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.559
Look, I hope you didn't take
that thing I gave you earlier.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.637
I overreacted.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.360
What you want me do,
you want me to scream it from the rooftops?

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:13.040
I'm not ready
for you to grow up.

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.231
Okay?
You're my little girl.

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.957
You forgive me?

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:23.477
Okay, uh...

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:37.713
Give these to Aunt Ellie.

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.070
- What's this for?
- It's for everything.

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:43.397
Take them down,
I'll meet you guys in the lobby,

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.036
and, uh, we'll head over
together, all right?

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.192
Baby, I love you.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.038
You too.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.317
- So why aren't you downstairs?
- Ah, Jesus Christ!

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.319
I almost forgot
you were there.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.840
What happened?

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.634
Josie called off
the rest of the day.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.276
- What?
- Yeah, some guy came after me about Joel Hedlund.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.036
I didn't have the mental capacity
or the balls to take him on.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:26.232
Oh, good. I'll go
talk her off a roof.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:28.920
No, please.
Please, please, stay here.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.956
What was she saying
to you just now?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.992
Hmm? Nothing, really.

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.077
Oh, come on.

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.396
You're my best spy.

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:45.114
She doesn't talk
to me.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.072
I don't know.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.794
She's got this, uh,

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:52.150
mock trial thing
at school.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.760
They got invited to
a competition in Lake Tahoe,

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.554
- so she must be pretty good at it.
- Okay.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.478
Well, that explains
the Perry Mason routine.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.876
I got cross-examined
over lunch.

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:06.312
Did she mention
anything else of note?

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:11.120
Asked if I could arrange
for her to see it.

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.470
All right. Okay.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.070
Not what I was
expecting you to say.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.637
How'd you respond?

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.831
I told her,
you know,

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:26.839
he's a messed-up guy
with problems.

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.759
It was probably a bad idea.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.918
Good.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.599
Good.

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.233
You got any of that stuff
left over from last night?

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.796
Is that a good idea
right now?

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:49.878
I'm done yammering
for the day.

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.116
Come on.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.516
Tonight's second nature.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.234
Got to get out of my head.
You know that.

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.154
I'm getting myself all worked up
from over-thinking everything.

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.431
I keep picturing
all those people screaming

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.790
and running
all over the sand.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.753
Look, we'll just do
what we have left.

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.031
We won't call for more
until after the show.

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.434
You can fuck me
for a little while we're high.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.151
I'm scared.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.076
Nothing to be
scared about, kiddo.

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:44.032
Nothing.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.759
Celeste, come on.

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.837
Everybody's downstairs.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.434
- Stop the car.
- No, no, no, no. No. We're running late.

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.075
- Just pull over for two minutes.
- What is it?

01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.396
I just... I just need to do
something for two minutes.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.352
Will you stop
the fucking car, please?

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:11.557
Stop the car!

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.399
Come on!

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.273
Get down with me.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.277
What are you doing?

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.233
Let's just have a moment
of silence together.

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.872
Let's shut our eyes

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:29.596
and hold everyone who's suffering
right now in our hearts.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.634
Can I help you, miss?

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:04.149
- Nobody calls me that.
- Give her some space.

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:06.317
I got you.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.272
- You got her?
- Yeah.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.196
- Are there cameras down there?
- Not that I know of.

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.597
- Tell your team if anyone is caught photographing her...
- No photos!

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.056
- ...they are fucking fired!
- We'll fire their fucking asses.

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.037
What can we get you?

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:26.993
Mmm...
I'm very thirsty.

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.918
Get her some water
and something to eat.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.475
- Okay, what would she like?
- Uh, anything with sugar.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.751
- Soda.
- Where's Albertine?

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:36.793
- She's behind you.
- Will you take her and get her something to drink?

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.877
We're not going anywhere.
I'm right here.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.674
Oh,
I was just coming up to introduce myself.

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:44.599
- I'm stepping in for O'Malley tonight.
- Who's O'Malley?

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:48.554
- Now is not a great time.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I can come by your dressing room later.

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:51.593
I need you to call this!
She can't go on.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:54.280
Celeste, stop
with the histrionics.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.232
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Okay? Get it together.

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:58.351
I know. We've been here
every day for a week.

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:01.040
Let go of me!
Let go of me!

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.720
Everyone thinks
I'm some kind of idiot!

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.640
- No one thinks you're an idiot.
- Just shut up!

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.831
- Stop being a spoiled brat.
- Don't call me a brat.

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:10.839
- Stop being a spoiled fucking brat.
- Don't call me a fucking brat!

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:14.317
You shut up.
Shut up and stop being a spoiled brat.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.271
- Right this way, guys.
- Thank you.

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.516
- Spoiled brat.
- Don't you ever

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.075
fucking call me
a spoiled brat!

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:29.393
Don't you ever!
I am sick of everybody

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.478
treating me like
I'm not a person!

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.557
Get it together.

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:38.196
Get your shit together.
Do not come in here

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:40.391
and indulge this unhealthy
behavior, Ellie!

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.955
Close your eyes.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.640
- Get out of here.
- Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:47.876
I said, get out!

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.673
Close your eyes
and pretend

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.576
- you're the only one in the room.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.478
Do you want me
to call this off?

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.080
You're dancing in your room.
What did you say?

01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:02.073
Move.

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:14.471
Everybody's is talking about me like
I'm not right in front of them.

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:17.319
I'm right in front of them...

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.114
He's a car salesman.
Don't worry about him.

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.479
Hey.

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:27.992
They showed me these
promos we shot today.

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:31.556
I looked so bad.

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.240
- What are you talking about?
- So bad!

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:38.957
No, don't look
at me like that.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.071
- Listen to me.
- Okay.

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:44.158
Listen to me.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.597
So they told me
the camera we were using

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.632
was gonna be great.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.514
I looked so ugly.

01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:56.439
I looked so ugly!

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.040
And it made me
want to die!

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:01.117
No. You're not
gonna die.

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.880
I just want to be
queen for them,

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:06.799
and sometimes I don't
feel like a queen at all.

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:09.434
Sometimes...

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:13.554
I'm just so ugly
underneath all this.

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.796
If they only knew.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:18.799
I'm so grateful
you're alive.

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.797
I'm here.

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:24.629
They can be so mean!

01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:27.400
So mean!

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.397
That's because
they've never done anything

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.999
they're proud of, honey.

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.475
Right!
You're right!

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.276
You're not here for them.

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:39.437
You're here for your fans.

01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:43.076
And tonight will be the
greatest night of their lives.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.954
The public will be
at your feet again.

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:50.230
In just a few minutes,
this nightmare you've been living

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.397
will all be over,

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:55.274
and it will have all
been worth it.

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:03.111
Let me help you
get dressed.

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.551
Two minutes.
Two minutes, guys!

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.440
- All right, two-minute warning!
- Watch your step, miss.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.317
Coming through!

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.556
Clear those cables.
They're coming in.

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.637
Excuse me.
Coming through.

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.156
- Excuse me.
- Excuse us.

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:36.119
Watch your step here.

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.557
- Stage team, take your places.
- Excuse us.

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.240
- Places, please.
- Clear. Clear out of the way. Thank you.

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:46.717
- Quick, over here.
- You look amazing.

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.035
Are you ready?

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.719
My daughter's
out there tonight.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.752
Got to make this
amazing for her.

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.996
All right.
Let's get started.

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:55.918
All right, everybody
gather round Cel.

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.389
Okay, I just
want to say thank you

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.080
for this beautiful group
of talented people.

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.840
I want to take a minute
to reflect on the last year

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.997
and this crew,
who are like family.

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:13.397
None of this would be
possible without you.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.799
Then let's give our girl some love!

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:25.511
- Who's the baddest bitch in the room?
- You are!

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:29.349
- Who's the sickest band on the planet?
- We are!

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:32.074
- Who makes this possible?
- We do!

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.077
- Are we gonna be good?
- No!

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.918
- Are we gonna be great?
- No!

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.953
- Are we gonna be amazing?
- No!

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.037
Then what are
we gonna be?

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.993
- Phenomenal!
- Yeah! Phenomenal!

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.416
Phenomenal!
Phenomenal! Phenomenal! Phenomenal!

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:49.000
Come on!
Take it higher and higher and higher

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.760

Late one
night at the hospital,

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:03.636
following that fateful morning
at New Brighton,

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:06.639
Celeste made a maddening claim
that only her sister

01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:09.320
had ever sensed to be true.

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:11.352
She recounted
a story to Eleanor

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:13.835
that went something
like this:

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:16.634
Shortly after her classmate
pulled the trigger

01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:19.798
and sent her to the place
between life and death,

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.390
a place that she was only able
to describe to Eleanor

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:25.756
as a rush of color,

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:28.599
She had met the devil
and made a deal with him

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:31.200
in exchange for her life.

01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:34.916
He whispered her melodies,
and she returned with a mission

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:37.953
to bring great change
to the next century.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.356
He said,

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:42.551
"Shut your eyes

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:46.196
and repeat after me:

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:48.675
