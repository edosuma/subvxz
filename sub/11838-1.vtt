CHARLIE: Dee, what are

00:18.332 --> 00:19.466
you doing?

00:19.533 --> 00:20.800
DEE: I'm eating cake.

00:20.868 --> 00:23.169
I can see that you're
eating cake, but that's Frank's

00:23.237 --> 00:24.397
cake from, like, a month ago.

00:24.438 --> 00:25.371
I threw that in the trash!

00:25.438 --> 00:26.238
DENNIS: Oh, my God.

00:26.306 --> 00:27.139
Seriously?

00:27.206 --> 00:28.307
Yes!

00:28.375 --> 00:29.675
Dee, you're eating
trash cake and smoking?

00:29.743 --> 00:31.425
I mean, you know what
you look like?

00:31.487 --> 00:32.219
You look like...

00:32.287 --> 00:33.387
Like a bird?

00:33.455 --> 00:35.656
Yeah. Yeah, of course you
look like a bird.

00:35.724 --> 00:36.524
Yeah.

00:36.592 --> 00:37.625
You always look like a bird.

00:37.693 --> 00:39.373
But I was gonna say, uh,
you look like a...

00:39.427 --> 00:41.661
Like a, like a bird lady
covered in bird shit

00:41.729 --> 00:42.562
eating cake?

00:42.630 --> 00:43.497
Dee, slow down, all right?

00:43.564 --> 00:44.498
Yeah. Let the man do this.

00:44.565 --> 00:45.431
Let me do my thing.

00:45.500 --> 00:46.500
You're jumping on my thing here.

00:46.567 --> 00:48.067
MAC: You know what she
looks like?

00:48.135 --> 00:49.903
She looks like a bird
that has no...

00:49.971 --> 00:51.838
A bird with no tits and no ass?

00:51.906 --> 00:53.006
Dee, let us handle...

00:53.073 --> 00:53.874
Yeah.

00:53.941 --> 00:54.841
FRANK: I got one, I got one.

00:54.909 --> 00:55.830
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

00:55.877 --> 00:56.642
She looks like...

00:56.710 --> 00:57.510
Like a bird.

00:57.577 --> 00:58.377
That was it.

00:58.444 --> 00:59.177
Was that it?

00:59.245 --> 00:59.778
Ah...

00:59.846 --> 01:00.846
That was it.

01:00.914 --> 01:01.747
See? That would have
been funny, Dee.

01:01.815 --> 01:02.681
Right. Yeah, Dee, don't...

01:02.749 --> 01:03.509
What are you doing?

01:03.517 --> 01:04.349
You know, that's not fun.

01:04.417 --> 01:05.250
Stop. Stop whatever this is.

01:05.318 --> 01:06.018
I don't like it.

01:06.085 --> 01:07.119
I'm sorry, you guys.

01:07.186 --> 01:07.786
I'm sorry.

01:07.854 --> 01:08.494
Don't apologize.

01:08.522 --> 01:09.254
That's just sad.

01:09.322 --> 01:10.489
Fight back at us.

01:10.557 --> 01:11.456
What's the point?

01:11.525 --> 01:13.190
The joke's always on me,
all right?

01:13.258 --> 01:14.358
I get it.

01:14.426 --> 01:16.060
Yeah, but it's no fun
unless you fight back.

01:16.128 --> 01:16.928
Yeah.

01:16.996 --> 01:17.729
Yeah, I'm just gonna go home.

01:17.796 --> 01:18.496
Good, go home.

01:18.564 --> 01:19.430
I hope you, uh...

01:19.498 --> 01:20.665
You hope I get hit by a bus?

01:20.733 --> 01:21.566
Dee, come on, that's...

01:21.634 --> 01:22.667
What difference does it make?

01:22.735 --> 01:24.769
I can't get any lower than
I am already.

01:24.837 --> 01:27.304
I might as well just throw
myself in front of a bus

01:27.372 --> 01:30.073
though, because I'm so ugly
I can't even get a bus

01:30.141 --> 01:30.674
to hit on me.

01:30.742 --> 01:31.374
Well.

01:31.442 --> 01:34.044
Geez.

01:34.111 --> 01:35.932
What the hell was that
all about?

01:37.207 --> 01:39.909
I'll tell you exactly what
that was.

02:12.175 --> 02:14.276
Did you kill yourself,
Dee, or...?

02:14.344 --> 02:15.244
Ah.

02:15.311 --> 02:16.044
Dee, why is your door unlocked?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.236
Do you realize how unsafe
that is?

02:18.304 --> 02:19.471
Mm-hmm.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.105
Okay, Dee, this is
truly pathetic, and you are

02:21.173 --> 02:25.207
really bringing us down,
so we're gonna help you out.

02:25.327 --> 02:29.542
We realize we may be in some
ways responsible for the

02:29.662 --> 02:30.512
state you're in.

02:30.632 --> 02:32.600
Yeah, all right, so we got an
idea though, okay?

02:32.668 --> 02:34.801
We're gonna sign you up for an
open mic night at a

02:34.868 --> 02:35.702
comedy club!

02:35.770 --> 02:36.503
Yes.

02:36.570 --> 02:37.604
Right? That's your thing!

02:37.672 --> 02:39.105
And we're actually gonna support
you, Dee.

02:39.173 --> 02:41.274
And now that you don't care
anymore, you're not gonna

02:41.342 --> 02:42.676
gag on stage.

02:42.743 --> 02:44.311
Yeah, you know, you're right
in that sweet spot between,

02:44.378 --> 02:47.514
like, suicidal and actually
dead, where most comedians,

02:47.581 --> 02:48.981
they thrive there.

02:49.049 --> 02:51.917
Yeah, what was that thing you
said about how the joke's always

02:51.984 --> 02:52.751
on you?

02:52.819 --> 02:54.152
That could be a catchphrase.

02:54.220 --> 02:56.355
Dee, look, I don't want to
pile on here, 'cause you're

02:56.423 --> 02:57.956
clearly very close to killing
yourself...

02:58.024 --> 02:59.291
Yeah.

02:59.359 --> 03:01.293
...but I got to say, I
totally disagree with the guys

03:01.361 --> 03:02.060
on this.

03:02.128 --> 03:03.529
I'm glad you've given up.

03:03.596 --> 03:06.431
And I want to propose something
totally different: I would like

03:06.498 --> 03:08.065
to find you a man.

03:08.133 --> 03:09.033
Come on.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.063
Yeah. A man to settle
down with.

03:10.183 --> 03:11.697
Now, I'm not talking about a
smart man, not-not

03:11.737 --> 03:13.972
a handsome man,
but a very, very average if not

03:14.039 --> 03:17.174
below average man to take you
off of our hands forever.

03:17.242 --> 03:19.511
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

03:19.578 --> 03:20.512
Go with it.

03:20.579 --> 03:21.512
Go with it?

03:21.579 --> 03:22.178
Which one?

03:22.246 --> 03:23.246
You were not clear.

03:23.314 --> 03:24.180
The thing. Whatever. Both.

03:24.248 --> 03:24.948
I don't care.

03:25.016 --> 03:25.937
Let's-let's do my plan.

03:25.950 --> 03:26.650
The comedy plan.

03:26.718 --> 03:27.751
Let's do our plan.

03:27.819 --> 03:29.459
We're gonna do the comedy plan,
all right?

03:29.521 --> 03:31.421
Meh.

03:37.628 --> 03:40.730
(breathing into microphone)

03:48.838 --> 03:49.553
(hushed): Dude, she is gonna

03:49.673 --> 03:51.908
bomb so hard, and then she's
gonna feel worse.

03:51.975 --> 03:52.709
(hushed): It's okay, dude.

03:52.838 --> 03:54.705
She'll tell a couple jokes, and
then we'll, like, fake laugh

03:54.772 --> 03:55.706
and stuff, you know?

03:55.773 --> 03:57.674
And tomorrow we can shit
on her.

03:57.742 --> 04:00.444
And she'll fight back and
be happy again.

04:00.512 --> 04:03.014
Say something!

04:03.081 --> 04:04.721
(listlessly): I decided
to stop showering.

04:04.749 --> 04:06.550
(Frank laughs)
Too much, Frank, too much.

04:06.618 --> 04:07.418
That's...

04:07.486 --> 04:08.519
There was no joke told.

04:08.586 --> 04:10.353
I just figured,
"What's the point?

04:10.421 --> 04:12.155
I'm just a filthy person."

04:12.223 --> 04:15.658
I passed out at the park the
other day, and a couple of kids

04:15.726 --> 04:19.795
wrote, "Wash me" in the filth
on my vagina.

04:19.863 --> 04:21.531
(laughter) Gross.

04:21.598 --> 04:22.732
That was kind of funny, man.

04:22.799 --> 04:23.720
That was kind of funny.

04:23.734 --> 04:24.501
It was so gross.

04:24.568 --> 04:25.534
It was gross.

04:25.601 --> 04:27.302
Yeah, but that guy over
there laughed.

04:27.370 --> 04:29.471
I guess, joke's on me.

04:29.539 --> 04:31.340
(laughter)
There's the catchphrase.

04:31.408 --> 04:32.241
Yeah, yeah! Ca...

04:32.308 --> 04:33.208
Yeah, that's like a ca...

04:33.276 --> 04:34.209
This is ridiculous.

04:34.277 --> 04:36.345
I'm gonna go select some men
for Dee.

04:36.413 --> 04:37.129
This is a waste of time.

04:37.174 --> 04:40.477
Um, I stepped in front of a
bus, but it missed me.

04:40.544 --> 04:43.245
I can't even get a bus
to hit on me.

04:43.313 --> 04:45.715
(laughter) People are laughing!

04:45.782 --> 04:46.616
We love it!

04:46.683 --> 04:47.483
For real.

04:47.551 --> 04:48.150
For real?

04:48.218 --> 04:49.184
Yeah!

04:49.252 --> 04:50.319
Knock, knock, knock.

04:50.387 --> 04:51.988
Can we say hi? There she is!

04:52.055 --> 04:52.989
Comedy star.

04:53.056 --> 04:53.689
Dee so funny.

04:53.757 --> 04:54.423
Really funny.

04:54.491 --> 04:55.391
Oh, my God, so funny.

04:55.458 --> 04:56.658
Great! It was
absolutely great!

04:56.660 --> 04:58.793
You did the bus joke, and it
was like...

04:58.861 --> 04:59.794
They loved the catchphrase.

04:59.862 --> 05:00.943
They loved the catchphrase!

05:00.963 --> 05:02.003
And think about this, Dee.

05:02.065 --> 05:03.065
You didn't even gag once.

05:03.066 --> 05:03.932
Not one dry heave, nothing.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.933
I guess I did pretty good.

05:05.001 --> 05:05.734
Yeah, great!

05:05.801 --> 05:07.102
"Pretty good," she said!

05:07.170 --> 05:08.337
Dee, it was one of those shows
where you're, like, "Whoa!"

05:08.405 --> 05:09.604
Oh, my goodness.

05:09.672 --> 05:10.672
And then your brain
goes (makes explosion sound).

05:10.740 --> 05:12.180
All right, guys,
will you stop, okay?

05:12.242 --> 05:13.141
You're not helping.

05:13.208 --> 05:14.275
Please, go get a drink,
all right?

05:14.343 --> 05:15.043
Give us a second.

05:15.110 --> 05:16.144
I need to talk to Dee.

05:16.211 --> 05:16.977
We tried.

05:17.046 --> 05:17.745
Yeah, you tried.

05:17.812 --> 05:18.513
That was it.

05:18.580 --> 05:19.514
Thanks, guys.

05:19.581 --> 05:20.381
All right, listen,
listen to me.

05:20.449 --> 05:21.682
Your set tonight was terrible.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.017
It was atrocious.

05:23.085 --> 05:24.485
Every single thing that came
out of your mouth was trash.

05:24.553 --> 05:25.553
It was filth. It was disgusting.

05:25.620 --> 05:27.221
That's what really happened,
okay?

05:27.289 --> 05:28.656
I want to be very clear
about this.

05:28.723 --> 05:31.324
Now, listen, I brought some men
for you to look at, all right?

05:31.392 --> 05:32.259
I've got some selections.

05:32.326 --> 05:33.660
Now, they're not great.

05:33.727 --> 05:35.662
They're not, they're not anybody
to brag about, but, uh, you

05:35.729 --> 05:37.130
know, they're men.

05:37.198 --> 05:39.066
And they're probably willing to
spend their life with you, so...

05:39.133 --> 05:40.567
Uh, hey, uh, sorry
to interrupt.

05:40.634 --> 05:43.002
My name's Snyder, and I'm
a talent scout.

05:43.071 --> 05:44.371
And I just caught your last set.

05:44.439 --> 05:45.371
You were hilarious.

05:45.439 --> 05:47.639
So I just wanted to give you
my card.

05:47.707 --> 05:48.807
Give me a call.

05:48.875 --> 05:50.742
No, she will not be calling
you, sir, okay?

05:50.810 --> 05:51.677
Please do not encourage her.

05:51.744 --> 05:52.844
Get out of here.

05:52.912 --> 05:53.979
You're-you're interrupting my
work, all right?

05:54.047 --> 05:55.914
You're not on my list
of chosen men.

05:55.982 --> 05:56.715
Why would you be?

05:56.783 --> 05:57.515
What are you...?

05:57.584 --> 05:58.216
Christ.

05:58.284 --> 05:58.951
What are you doing?

05:59.018 --> 05:59.898
Why would you do that?

05:59.919 --> 06:01.219
Come on, Dee.

06:01.287 --> 06:02.454
That guy clearly just lurks
around these places pretending

06:02.521 --> 06:04.723
to be a talent scout so he
can hit on women.

06:04.791 --> 06:06.825
Now look-look at my selects,
all right?

06:06.893 --> 06:07.960
Look at these guys, huh?

06:08.027 --> 06:09.561
(Dee gasps) Yeah, I know.

06:09.628 --> 06:11.428
This one's just, like, one
big chin.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.263
Well, I didn't have a lot
to work with.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.232
You know, here we are,
and look at you.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.068
I mean, for Christ's sakes,
look.

06:17.135 --> 06:18.102
Okay, I'm sorry.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.536
Look, I want this to work,
I really do.

06:19.605 --> 06:21.472
So I know I can do better,
all right?

06:21.539 --> 06:22.773
Can you do better, all right?

06:22.841 --> 06:24.642
I'm gonna be at your house
tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.676
Have some new candidates
for you to look at, all right?

06:26.744 --> 06:27.376
Okay.

06:27.444 --> 06:28.411
This is gonna work.

06:28.479 --> 06:29.412
This is not gonna work.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.747
Let's get you cleaned up,
all right?

06:30.815 --> 06:33.616
God, everything you did tonight
was so gross.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.281
Dee, open up! Open!

06:38.349 --> 06:39.382
You're locking your door
all of sudden?

06:39.450 --> 06:40.330
What is that? Come on.

06:40.351 --> 06:41.218
You care all of a sudden?

06:41.285 --> 06:41.852
What? What?

06:41.919 --> 06:42.619
Hey, let me in.

06:42.686 --> 06:43.486
I got selections for you.

06:43.554 --> 06:44.520
Now's not a good time.

06:44.588 --> 06:45.789
I'm right in the middle
of something.

06:45.857 --> 06:47.057
They're good selections.

06:47.125 --> 06:48.625
Hey, it's the time I said,
so it's the time it'll be.

06:48.692 --> 06:50.025
Now let me in. I got selects.

06:50.093 --> 06:51.894
I don't care about
your selects.

06:51.962 --> 06:52.594
Go!

06:52.662 --> 06:53.422
What are you doing?

06:53.429 --> 06:54.130
Are you hiding something?

06:54.197 --> 06:54.864
No.

06:54.931 --> 06:55.732
Is someone in there?

06:55.799 --> 06:56.565
No, no. Don't worry about it.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.714
Let me in or I'll barge in.

06:57.768 --> 06:59.668
Hey, everything all right
over there, Dee?

06:59.736 --> 07:01.070
Yeah, it's fine.

07:01.138 --> 07:03.105
Oh, no.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.606
Dee, oh... Oh!

07:04.674 --> 07:05.606
Snyder?

07:05.674 --> 07:06.374
Mm-hmm.

07:06.441 --> 07:07.675
He's clearly using you.

07:07.743 --> 07:09.778
Or you're using him to further
your nonexistent career.

07:09.845 --> 07:10.779
I am not using him.

07:10.846 --> 07:11.980
Oh, you're not using him?

07:12.047 --> 07:12.814
Nope.

07:12.882 --> 07:13.447
Oh, good, good, good, good.

07:13.515 --> 07:14.196
So, you like him?

07:14.250 --> 07:14.916
Mm-hmm.

07:14.984 --> 07:15.616
Find him attractive?

07:15.684 --> 07:16.918
Absolutely.

07:16.986 --> 07:18.619
Describe the ways in which
you find him attractive.

07:18.687 --> 07:22.156
(Dee scoffs)
He's got... he's got all of

07:22.223 --> 07:23.857
his skin, still.

07:23.925 --> 07:24.892
Well, I would hope so.

07:24.959 --> 07:28.528
And that he has plenty of...

07:28.596 --> 07:29.562
teeth to get...

07:29.630 --> 07:30.697
But not all of them?

07:30.765 --> 07:32.032
No, not all of them.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.433
Hmm.

07:33.501 --> 07:35.502
Dee, why can't you see that this
is the same pattern that you

07:35.569 --> 07:36.703
always fall into?

07:36.771 --> 07:38.737
Some guy uses you or you
use him.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.139
And then you know what happens?

07:40.207 --> 07:42.108
It's use, use, use, fail, fail,
fail, and then it's suicide.

07:42.176 --> 07:44.343
You think you can't go any
lower?

07:44.411 --> 07:45.344
Because you can.

07:45.412 --> 07:46.545
Oh, yeah?

07:46.613 --> 07:48.915
Well, he got me another gig for
tonight, boner.

07:48.982 --> 07:50.183
What do you think of about that?

07:50.250 --> 07:54.052
(making goofy noises)
What-what is that?

07:54.120 --> 07:56.288
What are you... what are you
doing?

07:56.355 --> 07:57.422
Sound effects.

07:57.489 --> 07:59.390
Oh, goddamn, Dee.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.326
You have no idea what's funny.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.694
Don't do sound effects.

08:02.761 --> 08:05.596
(Dee making goofy noises)
Don't do... don't... wh-what...

08:05.664 --> 08:07.765
Oh, oh, oh.

08:12.938 --> 08:13.938
Hey, hey, hey! Oh!

08:14.005 --> 08:15.873
Hey, Dennis, oh, check this
place out.

08:15.941 --> 08:16.974
This is legit.

08:17.042 --> 08:19.009
Dude, dude, Dee's opening
for Landslide.

08:19.077 --> 08:20.144
That guy's, like, the real deal.

08:20.212 --> 08:21.345
I've never heard of him.

08:21.412 --> 08:22.746
Mostly diarrhea jokes.

08:22.814 --> 08:24.114
Yeah, he's the diarrhea guy,
but it look-looks like this

08:24.182 --> 08:26.316
comedy stuff's paying off for
her.

08:26.383 --> 08:27.550
Yeah, well...

08:27.617 --> 08:29.018
Hey, you don't get a gig like
this by accident.

08:29.086 --> 08:31.020
Oh, come on, don't get too
excited, all right?

08:31.088 --> 08:33.056
She got the gig 'cause she's
banging some creep.

08:33.123 --> 08:34.224
It's not gonna go well.

08:34.291 --> 08:35.091
Who's the nerd?

08:35.159 --> 08:36.458
Who, this guy? This is Walt.

08:36.525 --> 08:38.494
Yeah, guy's got no self-esteem,
just like Dee, so they're

08:38.562 --> 08:39.863
perfect for each other.

08:39.929 --> 08:41.730
So after she bombs tonight, I'll
put them together, thereby

08:41.797 --> 08:44.766
controlling the situation, and
her, as I always have and I

08:44.834 --> 08:46.301
always will.

08:46.369 --> 08:47.469
What?

08:47.536 --> 08:49.139
Uh... Walt, just Walt-Walt's
the plan.

08:49.578 --> 08:50.129
I'm Walt.

08:50.172 --> 08:51.071
Yeah, shut up, Walt.

08:51.139 --> 08:52.105
They know who you are.

08:52.174 --> 08:53.240
I'm sorry.

08:53.308 --> 08:55.408
Ladies and gentlemen, Sweet
Dee Reynolds!

08:55.476 --> 08:57.577
(crowd cheering) Sweet Dee!

09:02.015 --> 09:04.350
(breathing into microphone)
Sweet Dee, joke's on you!

09:08.589 --> 09:11.223
(laughter) She's got fans now?

09:11.291 --> 09:12.624
Christ, come on.

09:12.692 --> 09:17.396
So I finally broke down and I
took a shower the other day.

09:17.463 --> 09:21.900
The stink flipped around and now
my soap smells like dirty vag.

09:21.967 --> 09:24.135
(laughter)
She said "vagina."

09:24.204 --> 09:25.370
A woman said "vagina."

09:25.438 --> 09:27.072
That's what makes it funny!

09:27.139 --> 09:28.072
Tasteless.

09:28.139 --> 09:31.141
(robot voice): Vagina,
vagina.

09:31.210 --> 09:32.376
Vagina, vagina.

09:32.444 --> 09:36.647
(laughter) (making fart noises)

09:36.715 --> 09:38.916
And the sound effects out of
absolutely nowhere, no setup.

09:38.983 --> 09:39.917
But it's funny!

09:39.984 --> 09:41.919
It's not funny, it's not funny.

09:41.986 --> 09:42.953
It's funny, Dennis.

09:43.021 --> 09:43.986
What are you doing?

09:44.054 --> 09:44.954
Will you stop laughing, Walt?

09:45.022 --> 09:46.055
Oh, my God, this is the worst.

09:46.123 --> 09:47.990
People will laugh at absolutely
anything.

09:48.058 --> 09:49.025
This is comedy?

09:49.093 --> 09:53.096
(laughter)
So, men are just so hard.

09:53.163 --> 09:55.865
Tell you what, they all walk
out on me.

09:55.933 --> 09:57.467
Every one of them.

09:57.535 --> 10:00.769
I can't even keep crabs in this
vagina.

10:00.837 --> 10:03.505
(laughter)
They're all like, "Clickety

10:03.573 --> 10:05.653
clackety, clickety clackety,
clickety clackety clack.

10:05.709 --> 10:09.445
I got to get out of here!"
(robot voice): Evacuate vagina.

10:09.512 --> 10:10.846
"Clickety clackety, clickety..."

10:10.913 --> 10:14.850
(making machine gun noises)
The crabs have machine guns.

10:14.917 --> 10:16.016
That makes sense.

10:16.084 --> 10:18.453
All right, well, that's it
for me tonight.

10:18.520 --> 10:21.756
I'd like to say it was fun, but
I've had a better time ripping

10:21.823 --> 10:22.890
out my own pubes.

10:22.958 --> 10:24.325
Shellac, shellac, rip!

10:24.393 --> 10:28.363
(yelling wildly)
Ping, ping, ping, ow!

10:28.430 --> 10:30.965
(laughter)
Okay, you guys, well, I'm Sweet

10:31.032 --> 10:33.032
Dee, and the joke's on me!

10:33.100 --> 10:36.270
(crowd cheering)
What is going on?

10:36.337 --> 10:37.471
This is unbelievable.

10:37.538 --> 10:39.906
Let's give it up for Landslide!

10:39.974 --> 10:45.145
(crowd cheering)
Well, that was a funny white

10:45.212 --> 10:48.347
bitch, wasn't it? (laughs)
Skinny though.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.149
I took bigger dumps than her.

10:50.216 --> 10:54.453
(making fart noises) (laughter)

10:54.521 --> 10:56.822
It's a landslide!

10:56.890 --> 10:57.923
Oh, my God.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.858
I bet his diarrhea is nasty!

10:59.926 --> 11:01.560
Nasty!

11:01.628 --> 11:03.595
Oh, butts, vaginas and
diarrhea, great.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.264
This is what the world's
come to.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.933
(Charlie laughing) Hey, hey.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.268
You're on the list?

11:10.336 --> 11:11.969
The list? I'm-I'm Sweet Dee's
brother, so we're good.

11:12.037 --> 11:14.138
Can't let you back there
unless you're on the list.

11:14.206 --> 11:15.139
We got to be on that list.

11:15.207 --> 11:16.441
This is fantastic.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.109
I'm not on a list for a place
that I don't want to be.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.210
You know how that feels?

11:19.278 --> 11:21.378
Hey, Dee? Dee?

11:21.446 --> 11:23.013
Uh, don't play this game, Dee.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.816
I-I... We're five feet away from
you, I know you hear...

11:25.883 --> 11:26.784
Deandra.

11:26.851 --> 11:27.818
Dee. Dee.

11:27.885 --> 11:28.819
Da.

11:28.886 --> 11:29.820
Da.

11:29.887 --> 11:30.788
Da.

11:30.855 --> 11:31.789
Dah.

11:31.856 --> 11:32.823
Dah.

11:32.890 --> 11:34.792
Dah. Dah.

11:34.859 --> 11:35.991
Dee. Dee.

11:36.059 --> 11:38.892
(all chanting different
pronunciations of "Dee")

11:39.126 --> 11:40.059
Yes, yes, yes. What? What?

11:40.127 --> 11:41.027
Oh, hey.

11:41.094 --> 11:42.194
Hi. What?

11:42.262 --> 11:43.830
Hey, Dee, can we come back
there with you?

11:43.898 --> 11:45.865
Yeah, hey, we're, like,
you're biggest fans, like, great

11:45.933 --> 11:48.034
show, like, good job, like,
shut up, I'm sorry.

11:48.101 --> 11:49.035
We're gonna start a fan club.

11:49.102 --> 11:49.797
Oh, come on, stop kissing her
ass.

11:49.924 --> 11:50.891
Dee, enough of this, okay?

11:50.959 --> 11:52.453
Step over the rope and come meet
Walt.

11:52.574 --> 11:53.508
Tell you what.

11:53.575 --> 11:54.509
You three, you're in.

11:54.576 --> 11:55.543
Dennis, you're out.

11:55.611 --> 11:57.345
Go before she changes her
mind, go.

11:57.413 --> 11:58.373
Hey! Faced! Thanks, Dee.

11:58.381 --> 12:00.348
Dee, who do you think you are?

12:00.416 --> 12:01.866
What is the matter with you,
Dennis?

12:02.110 --> 12:02.843
You see them?

12:02.910 --> 12:03.844
They're supporting me, okay?

12:03.911 --> 12:05.144
Because they believe in me.

12:05.211 --> 12:07.713
A fan club could really help
further my career.

12:07.781 --> 12:09.381
Career? Oh, wow, Dee.

12:09.449 --> 12:10.650
See, you don't have a career.

12:10.717 --> 12:12.618
All right? So I need you to stop
all this right now.

12:12.686 --> 12:13.686
It's gone too far.

12:13.754 --> 12:14.687
Now, come meet Walt.

12:14.755 --> 12:15.855
He is my select.

12:15.922 --> 12:17.757
You know what I think this is
about, Dennis?

12:17.824 --> 12:18.758
I think you're jealous.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.592
I don't think you want me to
succeed.

12:20.660 --> 12:22.627
Dee, let me be very clear
about something.

12:22.695 --> 12:24.328
You will never succeed.

12:24.396 --> 12:25.764
Ever.

12:25.831 --> 12:28.099
Instead, you will fly too close
to the sun, and you will choke

12:28.167 --> 12:30.601
and you will gag in a
spectacular manner.

12:30.670 --> 12:33.038
So, please, for the love of God,
take Walt.

12:33.105 --> 12:34.372
Hi, I'm Walt.

12:34.439 --> 12:36.074
She knows your goddamn name,
Walt; I said it, like, a

12:36.142 --> 12:36.807
thousand times.

12:36.875 --> 12:37.808
Look, you know what?

12:37.876 --> 12:39.576
I don't want to be with Walt,
okay?

12:39.644 --> 12:41.378
And I don't want you to find me
a man.

12:41.445 --> 12:44.814
What I need you to do is stay
out of my way, because Sweet Dee

12:44.882 --> 12:46.983
is gonna be a star.

12:48.986 --> 12:52.556
(making machine gun noises)
(laughter)

12:52.623 --> 12:54.757
♪
♪ Oh.

13:17.446 --> 13:19.514
(crowd cheering) All right!

13:19.582 --> 13:21.516
Here, buddy, everyone else.

13:21.584 --> 13:26.221
(laughter)
(making machine gun noises)

13:26.288 --> 13:29.624
Right, I'm Sweet Dee, and the
joke's on me!

13:29.692 --> 13:32.093
Thank you very much.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.427
Good night.

13:33.494 --> 13:35.095
(crowd cheering wildly)

13:38.164 --> 13:39.214
I don't care that you only have

13:39.334 --> 13:40.103
one mic.
Look at me!

13:40.456 --> 13:43.004
Dee Reynolds does not use mics
that other so-called comedians

13:43.124 --> 13:44.178
have spit into, okay?

13:44.298 --> 13:45.832
So get another one.

13:45.900 --> 13:46.933
Dee Reynolds?

13:47.001 --> 13:47.967
Mm-hmm.

13:48.034 --> 13:49.001
Hi, I'm Michael Rotenberg.

13:49.069 --> 13:50.549
I'm a talent manager from Los
Angeles.

13:50.655 --> 13:51.613
I've heard a lot about you.

13:51.733 --> 13:53.138
Oh, hi. Well...

13:53.206 --> 13:54.974
I've got a proposition for you.

13:55.041 --> 13:57.282
One of my bigger clients is
supposed to do Conan tomorrow

13:57.310 --> 13:58.577
night, and something came up.

13:58.645 --> 14:01.179
They need to fill the spot,
and I brought your name up.

14:01.247 --> 14:02.715
Are you interested?

14:02.782 --> 14:04.816
Conan O...

14:04.883 --> 14:05.850
Conan O'Brien?

14:05.918 --> 14:07.218
Yeah.

14:07.285 --> 14:08.686
I would love to represent you,
too; I think you're amazing.

14:08.754 --> 14:11.155
I can fly you to L.A. tomorrow
on my private jet, and we can go

14:11.223 --> 14:12.156
straight Conan.

14:12.224 --> 14:13.190
What do you say?

14:13.258 --> 14:14.358
Uh, well, my goodness.

14:14.426 --> 14:17.061
This is all... This is all...

14:17.129 --> 14:20.030
This is all... (gags)
This is all... (gags)

14:20.098 --> 14:20.998
Oh, boy, hold on.

14:21.065 --> 14:22.565
Uh, you okay?

14:22.634 --> 14:23.800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:23.868 --> 14:26.036
It's just, uh, just had a
little piece of sausage.

14:26.104 --> 14:27.337
Okay, I'm sure you did.

14:27.404 --> 14:29.524
Um, now, I'm not stepping on
anyone's toes here, am I?

14:29.540 --> 14:31.642
Do you already have
representation?

14:31.709 --> 14:32.609
Representation? No.

14:32.677 --> 14:34.678
Hey, sweetheart, there you are.

14:34.746 --> 14:35.679
Ew! Mm-mm.

14:35.747 --> 14:36.548
Who the hell's that?

14:36.614 --> 14:37.880
This is, uh, my new manager.

14:37.948 --> 14:38.981
What?

14:39.049 --> 14:40.750
Sorry, Snyder, I don't need
you anymore.

14:40.817 --> 14:42.985
This guy's taking me to
Hollywood on a private jet.

14:43.053 --> 14:43.986
What? Hollywood!

14:44.054 --> 14:44.954
Hollywood!

14:45.022 --> 14:46.022
We're going to Hollywood!

14:46.023 --> 14:47.056
No, no, no!

14:47.124 --> 14:48.424
We're not going anywhere.

14:48.492 --> 14:50.059
There's plenty of room if you
want to take your friends.

14:50.127 --> 14:51.027
There's no room, okay?

14:51.094 --> 14:52.511
I have no use for you guys
anymore.

14:52.631 --> 14:54.517
Hey, what do you say we go
back to my hotel and have sex?

14:54.637 --> 14:55.603
Absolutely.

14:55.671 --> 14:56.638
Screw you, guys.

14:56.705 --> 14:57.752
What the hell, Dee?!
We made you!

14:57.823 --> 14:59.357
I'm sorry, you made me?!

14:59.424 --> 15:01.209
You made me?!

15:01.329 --> 15:02.429
I made you!

15:02.497 --> 15:03.997
Screw you guys, all right?

15:04.065 --> 15:05.966
(making goofy noises) Oh.

15:19.127 --> 15:19.928
- Here we go.
- Okay.

15:19.976 --> 15:20.709
You excited?

15:20.777 --> 15:21.309
Am I excited?

15:21.377 --> 15:22.744
Y... yes, I am.

15:22.812 --> 15:23.411
Yes, I...

15:23.480 --> 15:24.312
Dee, wait, wait.

15:24.380 --> 15:25.747
Wait.

15:25.815 --> 15:27.082
I made a mistake.

15:27.149 --> 15:28.784
All this time, I've been
searching for the perfect guy to

15:28.852 --> 15:31.619
take you off of my hands
forever, but... I realized

15:31.687 --> 15:32.920
something.

15:32.988 --> 15:37.458
The perfect guy's been under my
nose the entire time.

15:37.526 --> 15:39.894
It's me, Dee.

15:39.962 --> 15:41.863
I'm the perfect select.

15:41.930 --> 15:43.865
I know, I've spent my entire
life shitting all over your

15:43.932 --> 15:47.133
dreams, and not supporting you,
but I was wrong, Dee.

15:47.201 --> 15:48.902
I see that now.

15:48.970 --> 15:50.704
You can succeed.

15:50.771 --> 15:52.939
You will be a star.

15:53.007 --> 15:54.541
You have to take me.

15:54.609 --> 15:57.878
I'm your twin brother.

15:57.945 --> 15:59.880
I love you, Dee.

16:02.883 --> 16:06.084
Dennis...

16:06.152 --> 16:08.521
suck my dick.

16:08.588 --> 16:12.858
(Dennis grunting) Wait.

16:12.926 --> 16:13.859
Dee!

16:13.927 --> 16:15.293
No, wait, Dee, wait!

16:15.361 --> 16:16.629
Don't do this, Dee!

16:16.696 --> 16:18.130
Dee, wait!

16:18.197 --> 16:19.497
Dee, stop!

16:19.565 --> 16:20.932
Don't fly away now!

16:21.000 --> 16:22.299
Dee, wait!

16:22.367 --> 16:24.869
Wait!

16:24.937 --> 16:27.572
So when we get to L.A.,
you're going straight into the

16:27.640 --> 16:28.907
limo and right to Conan.

16:28.974 --> 16:30.642
I'm gonna whisk you right
backstage, and we go straight

16:30.709 --> 16:31.409
on.

16:31.476 --> 16:32.516
This is the big-time, Dee.

16:32.545 --> 16:33.745
You're not in Philadelphia
anymore, okay?

16:33.812 --> 16:35.145
Mm-hmm.

16:35.212 --> 16:36.112
People are gonna be screaming
your name, there's gonna be

16:36.180 --> 16:36.847
paparazzi.

16:36.915 --> 16:38.181
Papa... whew.

16:38.249 --> 16:39.082
(gagging): Paparazzi, huh?

16:39.150 --> 16:40.050
Yes.

16:40.117 --> 16:40.951
I tipped them off.

16:41.019 --> 16:42.452
It's all about image.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.486
It's great!

16:43.555 --> 16:44.555
It's all great.

16:44.622 --> 16:45.989
It's all super sudden though,
isn't it?

16:46.057 --> 16:47.791
(gags) Ooh.

16:47.859 --> 16:49.459
There's a real smell to
that one.

16:49.527 --> 16:50.193
Yeah, that...

16:50.261 --> 16:50.960
Are you okay?

16:51.028 --> 16:51.727
That one was... came...

16:51.795 --> 16:52.595
started deep, that's all.

16:52.663 --> 16:53.729
This is your moment, Dee.

16:53.797 --> 16:55.064
(Dee sighs)
If you nail this, we're talking

16:55.131 --> 16:57.266
sitcoms, movie deals, the whole
nine yards.

16:57.333 --> 16:58.100
Yeah.

16:58.168 --> 16:59.035
So let's get focused.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.036
Yes.

17:00.103 --> 17:00.836

17:00.904 --> 17:01.837
Yeah.

17:01.905 --> 17:02.872

18:50.276 --> 18:51.944
What is going on?

18:52.011 --> 18:53.178
We got you, Dee!

18:53.245 --> 18:54.312
We tricked you, we tricked
you, we tricked you!

18:54.380 --> 18:55.246
We set the whole thing up!

18:55.314 --> 18:55.847
You know?

18:55.915 --> 18:56.615
Yeah!

18:56.683 --> 18:57.482
None of that was real.

18:57.550 --> 18:58.215
All of these people are actors.

18:58.283 --> 18:59.349
I chartered a jet.

18:59.417 --> 19:02.219
We flew all over Philadelphia
for six hours.

19:02.287 --> 19:03.520
And I'm a garbage man.

19:03.589 --> 19:04.589
He's a garbage man!

19:04.656 --> 19:05.923
He's your garbage man!

19:05.991 --> 19:06.757
You've met him.

19:06.825 --> 19:07.524
None of this is real, Dee!

19:07.593 --> 19:08.492
None of it!

19:08.560 --> 19:09.994
Hey, hey, some of it was real.

19:10.062 --> 19:10.995
Yeah!

19:11.063 --> 19:12.162
You banged that guy!

19:12.230 --> 19:14.497
(laughter) Hey, best part?

19:14.565 --> 19:17.133
Dennis wasn't even in on any
of it!

19:17.201 --> 19:18.969
(laughs) I was and I wasn't.

19:19.036 --> 19:20.036
I was and I wasn't.

19:20.104 --> 19:21.137
He wasn't, he wasn't.

19:21.205 --> 19:22.538
No, no, no.

19:22.607 --> 19:23.940
No, we knew we had to drag him
through the mud, make it seem

19:24.008 --> 19:24.741
legit.

19:24.809 --> 19:25.642
It was great, it was great.

19:25.710 --> 19:26.676
The joke's on him, too!

19:26.744 --> 19:27.777
Yeah, joke's on him!

19:27.845 --> 19:29.112
(noisemakers blare)
Well, it was good.

19:29.179 --> 19:29.778
It was a good joke.

19:29.846 --> 19:30.613
It was a good joke.

19:30.680 --> 19:31.413
Good joke, guys, I love jokes.

19:31.481 --> 19:32.247
She's got more to say.

19:32.315 --> 19:33.015
Oh.

19:33.083 --> 19:33.782
She's got more to say.

19:33.850 --> 19:35.250
Why would you do this?

19:35.318 --> 19:37.285
Oh, well, you know, you were
being all mopey and annoying...

19:37.353 --> 19:38.286
Yeah.

19:38.354 --> 19:39.554
...complaining and stuff.

19:39.623 --> 19:41.389
We wanted to show you that
you could sink lower.

19:41.457 --> 19:42.891
Talking about killing
yourself, ugh.

19:42.959 --> 19:44.994
Some things you just don't
joke about, okay?

19:45.061 --> 19:45.742
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:45.794 --> 19:46.427
You took it too far.

19:46.495 --> 19:47.128
Right.

19:47.195 --> 19:47.829
Too far.

19:47.896 --> 19:48.663
Yeah.

19:48.731 --> 19:50.098
I took it too far?

19:50.165 --> 19:51.099
That's what I said.

19:51.166 --> 19:54.901
Oh... I took... I took it
too far?

19:54.969 --> 19:59.706
Oh, God, you sons of bitches!

19:59.774 --> 20:05.211
(roaring) And there she goes!

20:05.279 --> 20:06.246
She's back!

20:06.313 --> 20:08.048
(laughter)
I... no!

20:08.116 --> 20:11.117
All right, so we got Dee
back, and I think we may have

20:11.184 --> 20:11.951
broke Dennis.

20:12.019 --> 20:12.785
Broke me?

20:12.853 --> 20:13.819
Nah, come on, I'm good.

20:13.887 --> 20:15.287
(laughs) I love all this.

20:15.355 --> 20:16.288
This is great.

20:16.356 --> 20:18.323
I'm gonna pop out for a little
while.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.960
(laughing) He's not loving it.

20:21.028 --> 20:21.661
He's not.

20:21.728 --> 20:22.928
He's not loving it.

20:22.996 --> 20:24.663
No, he's not. (yells)
He might go kill himself.
