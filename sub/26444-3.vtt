And it's not just people and pets
who have homes:

13:08.455 --> 13:10.665
Hey, Spike, we have a great idea!

13:10.958 --> 13:13.043
We're going to teach you to fly!

13:13.877 --> 13:14.878
Why?

13:15.045 --> 13:16.838
Because flying is super fun!

13:17.130 --> 13:20.217
But I love gliding around
with my dragon hop.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.553
And I'm really good at it!

13:22.970 --> 13:24.430
[Spike]
Wee!

13:25.347 --> 13:27.600
Spike! Your dragon hop is awesome!

13:27.683 --> 13:29.643
-Yes, it's awesome!
-It's amazing!

13:29.727 --> 13:32.353
[Spike laughing]

13:34.690 --> 13:37.483
Hopping and gliding is not
as awesome as flying!

13:37.777 --> 13:40.612
Remember when I was learning
to ride my broomstick?

13:40.863 --> 13:43.573
I didn't think flying
was such a good idea then.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.158
Right!

13:45.242 --> 13:47.160
-I remember!
-Sure!

13:47.537 --> 13:49.372
But witches are supposed to fly!

13:50.957 --> 13:52.750
That's why we have broomsticks!

13:52.833 --> 13:54.668
And that's why vampires
have capes!

13:54.752 --> 13:57.128
[both]
And dragons have wings!

13:57.838 --> 13:59.882
Well, wings are good for flying.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.133
And Spike does have wings.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.345
Oh, and Spike can make
puffy clouds,

14:04.428 --> 14:05.888
and clouds are in the sky.

14:06.222 --> 14:07.430
So that means...

14:07.640 --> 14:10.183
Spike should fly
in the sky with the clouds!

14:10.600 --> 14:11.977
Exactly!

14:12.227 --> 14:14.062
Spike will love flying!

14:14.272 --> 14:15.940
We just have to teach him how!

14:16.440 --> 14:19.108
Are you sure this will make
Spike happy?

14:19.402 --> 14:20.777
Absolutely!

14:20.987 --> 14:24.573
When Spike learns to fly,
he'll be the happiest dragon ever!

14:24.823 --> 14:25.908
-I'll help!
-Me too!

14:25.992 --> 14:27.158
For sure, for sure, for sure!

14:27.242 --> 14:28.243
Let's go tell Spike!

14:28.618 --> 14:30.412
He's going to be so excited!

14:31.622 --> 14:32.790
Really?

14:33.165 --> 14:35.333
Isn't it the best news ever?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.962
We're all going to help you
learn to fly!

14:38.503 --> 14:39.547
No, thank you.

14:39.797 --> 14:41.090
[both]
Oh!

14:42.173 --> 14:44.175
But, if that's what you
really want,

14:44.385 --> 14:46.220
I guess I can try.

14:46.470 --> 14:47.805
-[Katya gasps]
-Yes!

14:47.888 --> 14:49.598
Thickety-thick-thistle,

14:49.807 --> 14:52.643
to help train Spike,
I need a whistle!

14:55.938 --> 14:58.773
Project Little Wings starts now!

14:58.982 --> 14:59.983
[whistle]

15:00.067 --> 15:03.070
Alright, Frankie! You're going
to be Spike's strength coach!

15:03.153 --> 15:05.322
Help him make those little wings stronger!

15:05.405 --> 15:06.407
Uh-uh!

15:06.490 --> 15:08.658
-Lobo. You are Spike's speed coach!
-Yes!

15:08.783 --> 15:10.702
Help make his little wings faster!

All right!

I'm so tired.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.940
[Spike grunting]

15:41.483 --> 15:43.652
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

15:43.818 --> 15:44.945
You're right.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.488
It's not a good idea.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.448
It's a great idea!

15:48.657 --> 15:51.243
Project Little Wings will be
a big success!

15:52.787 --> 15:54.997
My little wings are tired.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.502
Maybe we need to change
Project Little Wings,

15:59.918 --> 16:02.253
to Project Bigger Wings!

16:02.462 --> 16:03.963
Great idea, Drac!

16:04.213 --> 16:07.467
If Spike had bigger wings,
he could definitely fly!

16:07.760 --> 16:11.013
Hmm... Bigger wings.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.140
I've got it!

16:13.348 --> 16:14.642
To the art cubby!

16:14.975 --> 16:17.102
[all]
Alright!

16:17.518 --> 16:18.937
It's OK, little wings,

16:19.270 --> 16:22.775
someday, you're going to grow
big and strong,

16:23.233 --> 16:25.693
because that's what
dragon wings do!

16:26.445 --> 16:27.612
But, right now,

16:28.405 --> 16:30.782
I really like you just the way you are.

16:31.575 --> 16:34.662
There was an inventor
named Leonardo da Vinci.

16:34.870 --> 16:38.207
And he had all sorts
of great ideas about flying!

16:38.582 --> 16:40.833
These are his designs.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.463
[Lobo]
Wow!

16:45.088 --> 16:47.590
If we combine these wings

16:47.800 --> 16:49.677
with those springs,

16:50.218 --> 16:53.138
and a frame like that one,
make this bigger,

16:53.388 --> 16:55.015
and that smaller, and...

16:55.348 --> 16:57.017
[Zoe gasps]
Ta-da!

16:57.267 --> 16:59.645
-Wow!
-So amazing!

17:00.020 --> 17:01.730
Let's go build it!

17:01.813 --> 17:02.982
[all]
Yeah!

17:03.065 --> 17:05.275
Would anyone like
another pickle-jelly?

17:05.358 --> 17:07.027
-Yes, please!
-I would!

17:07.778 --> 17:10.238
-Pickle-jellies?
-Ugh!

17:10.905 --> 17:13.117
Presenting... Spike!

17:13.408 --> 17:16.453
And his Zoe da Vinci Wings!

17:16.787 --> 17:19.540
-Oh, wow!
-Wow!

17:20.373 --> 17:23.877
Wow, Zoe, these are really
big wings!

17:25.587 --> 17:28.382
Really big, and really heavy!

17:28.715 --> 17:29.925
[Spike grunting]

17:30.258 --> 17:33.428
-I got you!
-Thanks, Frankie.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.390
But how am I supposed to fly
with these things?

17:37.808 --> 17:39.350
[Cleo]
I've got this.

17:42.728 --> 17:43.938
It's working, it's working!

17:44.397 --> 17:45.815
Spike is going to fly!

17:46.023 --> 17:48.610
[Spike grunting]

17:48.985 --> 17:50.987
[Spike yelps]

17:55.700 --> 17:57.160
[children gasp]

17:57.870 --> 18:00.372
Oh, I'm not even going to ask.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.542
Sorry, Spike.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.545
It doesn't matter
if there are dents and dings,

18:06.628 --> 18:08.880
bring me those da Vinci Wings!

18:11.967 --> 18:14.427
[Katya]
Oh, no! They're ruined!

18:14.970 --> 18:17.222
Don't worry, Spike!
We'll find another way.

18:17.305 --> 18:18.390
It's OK.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.435
I don't know, guys.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.312
Spike seems pretty happy
the way he is.

18:24.980 --> 18:27.900
-[Frankie] He sure does.
-Maybe it's time to give up?

18:28.358 --> 18:29.358
No!

18:29.568 --> 18:30.902
We can't give up now!

18:30.985 --> 18:33.822
Katya, do you have a spell
that can fix those things?

18:33.905 --> 18:36.158
No, they're too smashed up.

18:36.908 --> 18:40.620
Oh, but maybe there's a spell
that can help Spike fly!

18:40.703 --> 18:42.330
Is it in one of your magic books?

18:42.413 --> 18:44.165
Maybe! Let's go look.

18:47.962 --> 18:50.213
There must be a spell in here somewhere.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.762
We are looking for a spell
so Spike can fly.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.180
Just like us!

19:00.390 --> 19:02.517
Are you sure Spike wants to fly?

19:03.018 --> 19:04.268
Just like you?

19:05.103 --> 19:06.522
Well, of course he does.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.565
Don't worry, Spike.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.110
I'm sure Drac and Katya
will find a flying spell for you.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.738
Oh. I don't care about flying.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.698
You don't?

19:16.948 --> 19:18.450
No, not really.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.703
But I don't want Drac
and Katya to be disappointed.

19:21.953 --> 19:25.582
But Drac and Katya said flying
would make you really really happy.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.377
Flying is what makes Drac and Katya happy.

19:29.753 --> 19:32.588
And my dragon hop is what makes me happy.

19:32.797 --> 19:36.092
It's exactly the right size
for my little dragon body.

19:36.302 --> 19:38.012
And my little dragon wings.

19:38.262 --> 19:40.930
It's the best super power ever!

19:41.138 --> 19:43.350
Your dragon hop is amazing.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.435
You know the best thing about it?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.270
[all]
No.

19:48.022 --> 19:50.690

at playing tag!

[music]

20:04.453 --> 20:06.122
[Cleo laughing]

20:07.207 --> 20:09.585
There must be a flying spell somewhere.

20:09.793 --> 20:12.462
[children laughing]

20:17.383 --> 20:18.510
I don't get it.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.720
Spike looks like he's having fun!

20:21.178 --> 20:22.973
He's not sad that he can't fly!

20:23.557 --> 20:26.183
Well, kiddos,
just because you love flying

20:26.435 --> 20:29.437
doesn't mean that Spike
will feel the same way.

20:31.732 --> 20:32.857
[both]
Ew!

20:33.400 --> 20:36.612
Different people
like different things.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.363
Just like some people
like pickle-jellies,

20:39.782 --> 20:41.073
and some people don't.

20:41.325 --> 20:42.825
[both]
Oh!

[music]

20:46.872 --> 20:49.040
[children laughing]

20:49.332 --> 20:52.293
Spike. We're sorry we kept trying
to make you love flying.

20:52.377 --> 20:55.630
Just because we love it
doesn't mean that you have to.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.968
It's OK I know you just wanted me
to have fun and be happy.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.345
Every monster has something they love.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.388
Like stomping!

21:04.597 --> 21:06.140
Or going fast, fast, fast!
