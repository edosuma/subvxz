WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:04.338
[dramatic music]

00:04.372 --> 00:09.177
*

00:09.210 --> 00:11.312
- My name is
Demetrios Papatriantafyllou.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.613
I'm 42 years old.

00:12.646 --> 00:15.316
I was a chef in Colorado
for ten years.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.385
A lot of people asked me why

00:17.418 --> 00:20.054
when I switched from cooking
to blacksmithing,

00:20.088 --> 00:21.655
"Why?
They're so far apart."

00:21.689 --> 00:23.557
Just remind them that
they're both playing with fire.

00:23.591 --> 00:24.792
[chuckles]

00:24.825 --> 00:26.627
- My name's Storm Richardson.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.762
I'm 26 years old.
I'm definitely anxious.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.398
What are we gonna have to do?

00:30.431 --> 00:32.233
How can I do it better
than everybody else?

00:32.266 --> 00:34.468
And when do I start?

00:34.502 --> 00:38.639
- My name is Dan Hurtado.
I'm 46 years old.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.708
I'm here for the same reason
that I got into bladesmithing

00:40.741 --> 00:42.810
in the first place:
because it's fun.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.713
It's challenging.
It's unconventional.

00:45.746 --> 00:49.150
- My name is Neil Kamimura,
I'm 36,

00:49.183 --> 00:51.319
and I'm from
Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.421
Bladesmithing is
part of my heritage.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.289
My great-grandpa was
a blacksmith,

00:55.323 --> 00:56.857
and eight months ago

00:56.890 --> 00:59.160
when watching "Forged in Fire"
with my son,

00:59.193 --> 01:00.828
he asked me why I didn't do it,

01:00.861 --> 01:03.297
and the moment that
I forged my first blade

01:03.331 --> 01:05.133
was the moment I knew that
that's what I would be doing

01:05.166 --> 01:07.335
for the rest of my life.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.737
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.405
You're here to engage
in three rounds

01:11.439 --> 01:13.341
of edged weapon making
competition

01:13.374 --> 01:16.410
specifically designed to test
every aspect of your capability.

01:16.444 --> 01:19.413
All in the pursuit of a title,
"Forged in Fire" champion,

01:19.447 --> 01:22.416
and ten grand.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.518
Let's got ahead and meet
our panel of expert judges.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.255
ABS master smith J. Neilson,

01:27.288 --> 01:30.491
historic weapons re-creation
specialist David Baker,

01:30.524 --> 01:32.893
and last, Kali martial artist

01:32.926 --> 01:34.562
and edged weapon specialist

01:34.595 --> 01:36.630
Doug Marcaida.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.432
Because this is "Forged in Fire"

01:38.466 --> 01:40.568
and we like to throw curveballs
at people,

01:40.601 --> 01:42.170
in the first round
of competition today,

01:42.203 --> 01:44.205
you'll be using these.

01:44.238 --> 01:47.775
*

01:47.808 --> 01:50.478
Mining tools.

01:50.511 --> 01:54.415
- There's just a bucket
of coal and mining tools.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.184
I hope we don't have
to use both.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.418
[laughs]

01:57.451 --> 01:58.852
- You also have those two pieces

01:58.886 --> 02:01.155
of 1085 steel on your anvils

02:01.189 --> 02:03.824
that you can use
to forge those blades.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.626
So choose
your mining tools wisely

02:05.659 --> 02:07.195
because all of
these tools are made

02:07.228 --> 02:09.230
from different types of steel.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.632
In the second round, you'll be
attaching handles to your blades

02:11.665 --> 02:13.601
to turn them into
fully-functional weapons

02:13.634 --> 02:15.636
that will then be tested
for strength and durability

02:15.669 --> 02:17.905
in a coconut chop,

02:17.938 --> 02:22.343
and for edge retention
in a ratchet strap slice.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.845
All right, gentlemen,
grab your steel

02:24.878 --> 02:26.714
because your ten-minute
design window starts...

02:26.747 --> 02:28.949
*

02:28.982 --> 02:30.718
Now.

02:30.751 --> 02:34.555
[rock music]

02:34.588 --> 02:36.424
- Another pickaxe.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.958
- I mean, what would you
have pickeout from the table?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.360
- I would have picked
the same thing.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.262
That flat blade.
I know what it is.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.264
I can rely on it.
Part of this challenge

02:43.297 --> 02:44.565
is picking the right steel,
and they all chose

02:44.598 --> 02:46.300
the best steel on the table.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.602
- I'm gonna do
my signature bushcraft style

02:48.636 --> 02:50.304
with a clip point on it.

02:50.338 --> 02:53.407
Never before have I used
a mining tool,

02:53.441 --> 02:56.877
but the pickaxe is meant
to dig through dirt, rocks,

02:56.910 --> 02:58.746
so it should be
a high-carbon content steel.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.548
*

03:00.581 --> 03:03.817
- I plan on making
a san mai clip point bowie.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.219
I picked this design
because it's something

03:05.253 --> 03:06.687
I'm used to making,

03:06.720 --> 03:08.256
and my professional background
in cooking

03:08.289 --> 03:10.324
could help me win
the competition.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.660
Food can burn very quickly.
Steel's kind of similar,

03:12.693 --> 03:14.662
and you obviously
don't wanna overcook things.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.630
*

03:16.664 --> 03:18.599
- I'm making
a recurve camp knife

03:18.632 --> 03:20.601
because I think
it'll perform well

03:20.634 --> 03:23.337
in the coconut chop
and in the strap slice.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.806
I tend to be very careful
and take my time,

03:25.839 --> 03:27.641
and not rush things
when I'm forging,

03:27.675 --> 03:29.643
but that strength
may be a hindrance

03:29.677 --> 03:32.546
in a three-hour competition.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.582
I chose a kukri-style shape

03:34.615 --> 03:38.586
because I feel like it will
do well in both challenges.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.821
I'm 100% self-taught

03:40.854 --> 03:43.857
basically from watching
J. Neilson's videos.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.560
In eight months,
I made 72 knives,

03:46.594 --> 03:49.830
and I'm here to prove
that hard work will pay off.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.733
- Bladesmiths, your ten-minute
design window is closed.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.868
Your three-hour forge time
starts...

03:54.902 --> 03:55.936
*

03:55.969 --> 03:57.505
Now.

03:57.538 --> 04:02.843
*

04:05.012 --> 04:06.814
*

04:06.847 --> 04:10.884
- We have the option
of using 1085 carbon,

04:10.918 --> 04:13.321
but I'm gonna play it safe.
I'm not gonna do a forge weld.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.022
It's still more beneficial

04:15.055 --> 04:18.459
for me to go with
an unknown source of steel

04:18.492 --> 04:21.295
than to spend my time
possibly doing a forge weld

04:21.329 --> 04:25.433
that might not have a good,
hearty spine.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.368
I'm definitely
a very competitive person,

04:27.401 --> 04:29.870
so right off the bat,
I'm just running around

04:29.903 --> 04:31.372
like a chicken
with his head cut off.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.874
Welding!
Making sure I accomplish

04:33.907 --> 04:36.009
all the things that
I need to accomplish.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.746
- Storm is living up to his name
right now.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.749
There is just a storm
of activity around that guy.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.850
*

04:42.883 --> 04:43.817
- I'm in a time crunch,

04:43.851 --> 04:45.953
so...I'm running,

04:45.986 --> 04:49.056
and I'm getting things done as
fast as I need to get them done.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.858
*

04:50.891 --> 04:52.092
- Come on, baby.
Get hot.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.627
- Interesting.
He's putting

04:53.661 --> 04:56.564
the whole pickaxe head
into the forge.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.333
- My plan is to use
the back spike as a handle.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.934
That saves me the trouble

05:00.968 --> 05:02.770
of having to go to the band saw
and cut it off.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.805
I've got a built-in handle.
Why not use it?

05:04.838 --> 05:06.807
- I'd like to hope
that he's gonna try

05:06.840 --> 05:09.577
stretching one end
of that pickaxe out.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.044
See how much
he can get out of it.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.113
- I'm not gonna try
and forge weld.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.916
I trust this steel better
than I do my time management.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.418
*

05:17.451 --> 05:19.553
- I chose to go with the 1085

05:19.587 --> 05:21.655
inside the steel
from one of the pickaxes

05:21.689 --> 05:24.992
into a nice, big, thick billet
forge welded.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.561
- Of all of our smiths,
Demetrios is the only one

05:27.595 --> 05:29.363
planning on doing a forge weld.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.432
Is it worth the risk?

05:31.465 --> 05:33.567
- If you know how to forge weld,

05:33.601 --> 05:35.503
those pieces of steel
should weld up beautifully.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.604
- Oh, yeah,
it should be no problem.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.406
*

05:38.439 --> 05:39.807
- With the mild steel
from the pickaxe,

05:39.840 --> 05:41.975
I created a V.
Like, a slot

05:42.009 --> 05:44.678
where I could put
my high-carbon billet into.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.781
- He is inlaid the 1085 core

05:47.815 --> 05:50.418
into that sandwich construction.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.786
- Yep, little taco.
Yeah.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.054
- Hopefully,
everything will go well.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.589
*

05:55.623 --> 05:57.057
- My plan is:

05:57.090 --> 05:59.693
whack the metal really hard.
[laughs]

05:59.727 --> 06:00.994
Bladesmithing has
changed my life

06:01.028 --> 06:02.763
because it's a way to channel

06:02.796 --> 06:04.898
all my anger,
all my passion.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.600
- Kid's going after it, man.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.136
- Everything can pour
into one thing.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.472
My concern is that
I'm only using one metal,

06:11.505 --> 06:13.907
but I'm doing
what I feel comfortable with.

06:13.941 --> 06:17.611
- Bladesmiths,
30 minutes has already elapsed.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.146
- Going?
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.148
*

06:21.181 --> 06:25.118
- I wonder if Storm always moves
at, like, this speed,

06:25.152 --> 06:27.688
with this intensity.
- I'm pretty sure he does.

06:27.721 --> 06:31.459
*

06:31.492 --> 06:34.462
- After I've got the blade
profile the way I want it,

06:34.495 --> 06:38.098
I start drilling holes
for my dowels to go through.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.867
The bits are screaming.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.001
[metal scraping]

06:41.034 --> 06:42.202
Oh, my gosh.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.837
So two things are going on.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.072
Either the bit is very dull

06:45.105 --> 06:46.807
or my blade's already hard.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.876
- Storm,
grabbing a new drill bit.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.178
- I've probably got
10 or 15 minutes

06:51.211 --> 06:53.781
into drilling one hole.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.015
*

06:55.048 --> 06:57.785
There it goes.
All right.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.687
*

06:59.720 --> 07:02.089
- I'm loving this power hammer.
[chuckles]

07:02.122 --> 07:05.559
This thing does in seconds
what it would take me hours

07:05.593 --> 07:07.027
and lots of Aspirin to do.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.763
I feel great.
Whoo!

07:09.797 --> 07:11.799
I let this get
a little bit too thin.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.702
I'm gonna nip that off,
make a rectangular billet,

07:14.735 --> 07:16.770
and then go to the hand hammer.

07:16.804 --> 07:20.240
*

07:20.273 --> 07:22.175
It's as straight
as it's gonna get.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.478
I've shaped it
the way I want to

07:24.512 --> 07:25.813
using hammer and tongs.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.214
Now it's time
to go to the grinder.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.916
*

07:28.949 --> 07:31.485
I'm doing my best
to focus on my work,

07:31.519 --> 07:33.521
to not look at anybody else's.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.990
If I can be careful,
not make silly mistakes,

07:37.024 --> 07:39.259
then I feel confident
I can turn out a good blade.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.961
*

07:40.994 --> 07:42.830
- I don't have
a power hammer at home.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.732
I've never even seen one.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.734
I prefer to hammer shape it.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.269
- I just saw Neil pour water

07:49.302 --> 07:51.171
at the heel of his anvil,

07:51.204 --> 07:52.973
and every so often
while he's hammering,

07:53.006 --> 07:55.208
he goes back to dip it in there.
What's that all about?

07:55.242 --> 07:57.678
- That's a technique
based mostly in Japan.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.047
When that wet metal
strikes the hot steel

08:00.080 --> 08:01.682
it blows scale off.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.584
- I remember
my great-grandfather

08:03.617 --> 08:05.919
pouring water onto
his homemade anvil and hitting,

08:05.953 --> 08:09.289
and that's what symbolized
the blacksmith for me.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.725
I'm gonna try and stand out
by doing something

08:11.759 --> 08:13.827
with a little bit more
of my style,

08:13.861 --> 08:15.629
which is more
of an artist's approach.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.631
- Yeah, he's just
marking that blade up.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.132
- I like it.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.801
- I'm trying
to create something

08:20.834 --> 08:22.736
a little bit more artistic.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.172
I think straight lines
compliment curves.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.140
- He's putting
some part of himself in there.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.009
The look.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.878
- Something that's
a little bit more imperfect

08:30.911 --> 08:32.980
but handmade.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.584
- I designed
a san mai clip point bowie,

08:36.617 --> 08:38.619
but I changed
the design of my blade

08:38.652 --> 08:40.220
when I saw I wasn't gonna
get wide enough

08:40.253 --> 08:42.122
to be able to fit
all the way over my billet.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.592
- Demetrios doesn't have a whole
ton of steel to work with there.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.695
- Now I'm making
a drop point chopper,

08:47.728 --> 08:49.196
or slicer, so to speak.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.064
I can make these changes
on the fly.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.266
*

08:53.300 --> 08:55.135
Now I'm ready to heat-treat...

08:56.269 --> 08:57.938
Get it in the oil...

08:59.072 --> 09:00.641
Blow some smoke off...

09:00.674 --> 09:01.775
*

09:01.809 --> 09:03.777
Pew.

09:03.811 --> 09:04.845
Nope.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.313
Nice little curve.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.982
Get it right back in there.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.018
Pull it out,

09:11.051 --> 09:12.620
there's another warp,

09:12.653 --> 09:14.622
and it seems to be getting worse
with a twist.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.357
- I think the issue is
that blade is so thin.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.292
- It's not gonna stay straight.
- No.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.629
- I don't know what to do.
Time's running out.

09:21.662 --> 09:26.066
Gotta get it straight.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.335
- Nope.
[bleep].

09:28.368 --> 09:29.937
I can't get this warp out.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.839
I keep quenching

09:31.872 --> 09:33.741
over and over

09:33.774 --> 09:36.644
and over and over and over.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.947
[bleep].

09:39.980 --> 09:42.182
- Demetrios has quenched again.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.652
This is the eighth time.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.319
- What is the definition
of insanity?

09:46.353 --> 09:49.122
Doing the same thing
over and over again

09:49.156 --> 09:51.124
and expecting
a different result.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.893
- Time's running out.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.361
I'm tired of kicking
a dead horse,

09:54.394 --> 09:56.396
so I decide
to get the torches out

09:56.429 --> 09:58.966
and just do an edge heat treat.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.934
Quench it...

10:00.968 --> 10:04.404
*

10:04.437 --> 10:06.306
It stayed straight.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.208
[sighs]
Nine quenches.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.977
Hopefully there's
some carbon left in that steel.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.011
[laughs]

10:11.044 --> 10:13.981
[rock music]

10:14.014 --> 10:15.082
*

10:15.115 --> 10:17.284
- Storm has just quenched.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.319
- Everything seems good,

10:19.352 --> 10:21.922
but there's a slight warp.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.924
I don't wanna turn in
a warped blade.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.693
That's just one reason
for me to go home.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.261
Ahh...
[hums]

10:28.295 --> 10:30.998
If I do a three-pronged pinch
in the vice,

10:31.031 --> 10:32.332
I might be able
to take this warp out.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.101
I'm grabbing a torch,

10:34.134 --> 10:37.004
and I'm trying
to get this thing back straight.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.772
Ha-ha!

10:38.806 --> 10:41.775
It's straight
and I just feel so relieved.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.745
*

10:44.778 --> 10:46.880
- I'm getting ready
to quench the blade.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.916
I'm nervous,
I've got butterflies,

10:48.949 --> 10:50.718
the adrenaline's pumping.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.854
*

10:53.887 --> 10:55.422
I've got tunnel vision.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.157
I can't see
what's going on around me.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.358
*

10:58.391 --> 10:59.727
Everything looks straight.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.095
I don't see any cracks.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.363
Thank you, Lord.

11:03.396 --> 11:07.134
*

11:07.167 --> 11:09.069
- Neil's in the quench.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.371
- I really enjoy the fact
of a knife being shaped

11:11.404 --> 11:13.173
about 80, 85%

11:13.206 --> 11:15.843
of what its end result
is going to be,

11:15.876 --> 11:19.246
but my biggest concern is that
they don't like my style.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.348
Like,
it's a little too primitive

11:21.381 --> 11:24.284
or it's a little too unfinished
for them.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.385
*

11:25.418 --> 11:27.087
- Time is running out.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.989
I need to get this blade
looking good.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.859
I'm a little worried
about the thinness of my blade,

11:31.892 --> 11:33.060
for being a chopper,

11:33.093 --> 11:35.028
to be able
to go through a coconut.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.864
We'll see what happens.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.967
- Ten, nine, eight,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.136
seven, six, five,

11:43.170 --> 11:47.040
four, three, two, one.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.809
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines,

11:48.842 --> 11:51.478
drop your tools,
your forging time is over.

11:51.511 --> 11:55.048
*

11:55.082 --> 11:56.950
- Whew.
- Time's up,

11:56.984 --> 11:58.418
and I'm feeling
a little nervous

11:58.451 --> 12:01.121
about being critiqued
by J. Neilson

12:01.154 --> 12:03.256
because he's someone
I've looked up to.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.426
- There was some errors
in forging the knife,

12:06.459 --> 12:08.295
but I've done
everything I could do.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.964
At this point,
it's out of my hands.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.366
- Bladesmiths, over the course
of the last three hours,

12:13.400 --> 12:15.969
each of you has forged a blade
in your signature style.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.337
Now it's time for the judges

12:17.370 --> 12:19.139
to take a closer look
at your work.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.008
Neil, you're up first.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.542
Please present your blade
to the judges.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.377
[tense music]

12:24.411 --> 12:27.447
- Neil, I like watching you
work this blade.

12:27.480 --> 12:31.084
My big issue is your handle.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.486
This is extremely tiny.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.188
There's not gonna be
a lot to grip on.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.556
I'll be wailing away
on coconuts.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.359
I need something
I can hang on to.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.829
- I like the fact that
you were trying to do

12:41.862 --> 12:43.363
a little artwork on this.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.265
I really would have liked
to have seen that time

12:45.298 --> 12:48.501
put into refining the blade
a little bit more.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.970
- Dan, you're up.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.571
Please present your work
to the judges.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.175
*

12:55.208 --> 12:57.110
- Dan, you did a nice job.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.179
and you got a little bit of
a bend in there,

12:59.212 --> 13:00.380
but nothing major.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.115
But again,
we have a handle issue.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.384
Uh, quite the opposite
of the last one.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.453
You've got so much mass
in here.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.956
It's actually hard
to get all the way around,

13:08.989 --> 13:11.925
and especially if you put any
kind of thick scales on there,

13:11.959 --> 13:13.927
that could cause an issue.

13:13.961 --> 13:17.330
- I like the shape of that.
That's a great utility knife.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.066
Maybe the handles
a little bit off,

13:19.099 --> 13:21.869
but it seems to be well within
the range of a grinder.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.904
Good job.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.272
- Storm, you're up.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.140
Please present your blade
to the judges.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.976
*

13:29.009 --> 13:30.844
- Well, Storm,
your name matches

13:30.878 --> 13:32.245
the way you work out there.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.914
I was getting exhausted
watching you.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.216
Man, can you go,
but you know what?

13:36.249 --> 13:38.151
I like what you did out there.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.253
One thing, though,
there is that slight offset

13:40.287 --> 13:42.555
of your handle to the blade.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.292
- The issue I have is
with scale.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.861
I don't know anybody
with a hand that big.

13:47.895 --> 13:51.198
My hand wants to go
into this forward well,

13:51.231 --> 13:53.200
and that leaves
all that back there.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.003
Something to think about.
- Thank you.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.938
- And finally,
the man who set a new record

13:57.971 --> 13:59.239
for the number of quenches
in the first round.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.540
[both laugh]

14:00.573 --> 14:02.910
Demetrios Papatriantafyllou.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.378
*

14:05.412 --> 14:08.581
- Demetrios, I compliment
anybody who comes in here,

14:08.615 --> 14:10.217
uses all the materials
we give them,

14:10.250 --> 14:13.320
and forge welds.
That was great to see it,

14:13.353 --> 14:15.422
but you started
with thin material,

14:15.455 --> 14:17.157
ended up with not enough,

14:17.190 --> 14:20.027
and you end up with a blade
that was extremely thin,

14:20.060 --> 14:23.396
and that could cause
a big problem.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.132
- Well, bladesmiths,
that was a fantastic

14:25.165 --> 14:27.234
first round of competition,
but as you all know,

14:27.267 --> 14:30.570
one of you has to
leave the Forge.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.405
So while the judges
make that decision,

14:32.439 --> 14:34.007
I'm gonna ask you
to leave your blades here

14:34.041 --> 14:35.275
and please step off
the Forge floor.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.110
Thank you.

14:37.144 --> 14:43.216
*

14:43.250 --> 14:45.452
- Oh, here we go.
- Moment of truth.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.587
- All right, judges,
let's take a closer look

14:47.620 --> 14:50.090
at our smiths' blades.
We'll start with Dan.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.424
*

14:51.458 --> 14:53.360
- I really like that shape.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.462
You know, good camp knife,
good hunting knife,

14:55.495 --> 14:57.597
but we get into this problem
with handles

14:57.630 --> 15:00.567
where smiths just don't think
about shaping their handle.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.435
It just needs to be adjusted

15:02.469 --> 15:04.437
before it's really comfortable
in the hand.

15:04.471 --> 15:08.008
- Okay, let's move on
to Neil's down there on the end.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.676
- It's a good-looking blade,
man.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.344
That's gonna be
a heck of a coconut chopper.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.279
- Thank you.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.147
*

15:14.181 --> 15:16.549
- I like the overall shape
of the blade.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.119
One issue I have is his handle.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.353
When you put your hand
around it,

15:20.387 --> 15:22.022
it doesn't feel comfortable.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.423
It feels like the blade wants
to rotate around.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.625
But overall,
he's got a great blade to that.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.360
If he can fix the handle issue,

15:27.394 --> 15:29.129
that should be
a good blade to look at.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.732
- Okay.
Let's move on to Demetrios.

15:32.765 --> 15:33.733
*

15:33.766 --> 15:35.368
- Go big or go home.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.504
He chose to use
two serpent steels

15:37.537 --> 15:39.372
to forge weld them together,

15:39.406 --> 15:41.741
but he didn't use enough.
Because of that,

15:41.774 --> 15:44.311
he had to over-grind,
over-grind some stuff,

15:44.344 --> 15:46.713
and you can see that right here
on both sides.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.715
Especially with that warp
he was chasing.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.284
- Big props for forge welding.
- Oh, thks, Dan.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.253
- I mean, that's--
that's great.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.055
- Last blade is Storm's blade.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.723
*

15:56.756 --> 15:58.391
- I like where Storm's going
with this,

15:58.425 --> 16:00.160
but his hammer strikes

16:00.193 --> 16:01.761
and his grinding
were very erratic.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.564
There's multiple dips,

16:04.597 --> 16:07.234
deviations
all the way down this blade,

16:07.267 --> 16:09.169
and then he's gotta
move material on this side also

16:09.202 --> 16:11.204
for the warp in the handle,

16:11.238 --> 16:14.007
and I'm not sure he's even gonna
be able to pull that off.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.443
- So you judges have
a decision to make.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.245
Doug, have you made
your final decision?

16:18.278 --> 16:19.346
- Yes, I have.
- Dave?

16:19.379 --> 16:20.413
- Yeah.
- J.?

16:20.447 --> 16:21.548
- Yeah.
- All right,

16:21.581 --> 16:23.183
let's go tell our smiths.

16:23.216 --> 16:27.187
*

16:27.220 --> 16:29.589
The judges have completed
their deliberation,

16:29.622 --> 16:31.224
and they've made
a final decision.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.360
It's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

16:33.393 --> 16:39.232
*

16:39.266 --> 16:42.569
Demetrios,
your blade did not make the cut.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.305
- Demetrios, you did a great job

16:45.338 --> 16:47.274
setting your forge welds up.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.641
The problem is quantity.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.310
You don't have
enough material left

16:50.343 --> 16:52.812
to correct the issues.
You got the warp,

16:52.845 --> 16:55.182
you've got the issues with
the crease on the other side,

16:55.215 --> 16:56.783
and there's just
not enough there to fix it,

16:56.816 --> 16:58.351
so that's why we have
to send you home today.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.752
- I understand.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.488
- Demetrios,
you went above and beyond,

17:01.521 --> 17:03.190
but, unfortunately,
I have to ask you

17:03.223 --> 17:05.392
to please surrender your blade.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.394
- I totally agree
with the judges' decision.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.796
They called it.
I tried my best,

17:09.829 --> 17:12.632
didn't work out,
so can't be sorry about that.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.767
No regrets.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.669
- Congratulations,
bladesmiths,

17:16.703 --> 17:18.471
you've made it
into the second round.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.307
Your blades have been tempered
and now it's time

17:20.340 --> 17:22.342
to turn them
into fully-functional weapons

17:22.375 --> 17:24.077
by attaching handles to them

17:24.111 --> 17:26.713
using the range of materials
provided in our pantry.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.216
You will have three hours
in this round.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.318
Keep in mind that
after your time is up,

17:31.351 --> 17:32.785
your weapons will be tested

17:32.819 --> 17:35.388
for strength and durability
in a coconut chop,

17:35.422 --> 17:38.691
for edge retention
in a ratchet strap slice.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.360
Good luck, bladesmiths.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.761
Your time starts now.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.663
[rock music]

17:43.696 --> 17:45.398
- Here we go.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.867
- I don't know what this
swirly-looking mess is.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.802
I wind up choosing
a large piece

17:49.836 --> 17:53.506
of some kind of '80s retro,
disco-looking stuff.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.742
My goal is to have the handle on

17:55.775 --> 17:58.778
and let the epoxy start
setting up as quickly as I can.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.747
- So Dan, he's gonna go ahead

18:00.780 --> 18:03.183
and shape those scales
to his tang.

18:03.216 --> 18:06.586
But you, J., said that he
needed to re-profile that tang.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.155
- I just, like, feel like
it's one of my kids there.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.589
He just totally ignored
everything we said.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.191
[both laugh]

18:11.224 --> 18:13.360
*

18:13.393 --> 18:15.295
- I know right off the bat,
the first thing I'm doing

18:15.328 --> 18:17.430
is start cutting steel.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.232
- Yeah, he's gonna lose
a bunch of handle.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.301
- Okay, that's good.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.803
- What Storm's issues is,
you can really tell

18:23.836 --> 18:26.573
where the blade and the handle
are really off-line.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.242
- You could actually put
thick scales onto that handle

18:29.276 --> 18:30.677
and grind the handle off-center

18:30.710 --> 18:32.179
and straighten your blade out
that way.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.480
It's completely ridiculous,

18:33.513 --> 18:34.847
but it would actually work

18:34.881 --> 18:37.884
to get the handle
in-line with the blade.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.520
- What I need to do
for this round is

18:40.553 --> 18:43.290
to take heed
to what the judges' concern was.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.892
So I'm gonna shorten my handle

18:45.925 --> 18:49.196
and try and make my handle wider
for a better grip.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.864
- He's cutting a large section
off the back of his tang.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.566
- Nice.
- Smart move.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.602
- My method will be

18:55.635 --> 18:59.606
to add a centerpiece as a inlay

18:59.639 --> 19:02.542
and then wrapping scales
over both sides.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.677
- He's using a black Micarta,
which is tough stuff,

19:04.711 --> 19:08.248
and he's actually adding more
body to the bottom of his tang,

19:08.281 --> 19:10.383
so that way he'll have
more handle to work with.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.818
- Think that's a good plan?
- I think it's a great plan.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.286
I like this sculpture.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.623
- I call this vice grip.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.959
- Bladesmiths,
one hour has elapsed.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.462
You have two hours remaining
to finish your blades.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.397
- Shoeshining, buddy.

19:24.431 --> 19:27.300
I'm definitely taking
the judges' advice.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.702
I was concentrating so much
on this chopping motion,

19:29.736 --> 19:31.704
I wasn't really thinking about,
"what does it feel like

19:31.738 --> 19:33.740
when the blade is
just sitting there?"

19:33.773 --> 19:36.276
So I'm feeling good.
I'm starting to sharpen it.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.310
*

19:37.344 --> 19:38.411
- He's got tip up.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.479
It's gonna grab that belt.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.248
Stop--let's not do that.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.316
If that tip is pointing
towards the belt,

19:43.350 --> 19:44.517
it's gonna throw it at him.
Let's not do that--no, no, no.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.585
- Hey, hey.
- He's gonna do it again.

19:45.618 --> 19:46.786
- Hey, we need to kill that.

19:46.819 --> 19:50.590
- Oh, he just cut himself.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.924
- All right, hold on.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.561
The medic just flew in.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.563
- Oh, wow.

19:56.596 --> 20:00.233
I cut my thumb pretty good,
but that's not uncommon.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.268
Thank you.
Thanks.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.535
There is a little bit of me

20:02.569 --> 20:04.937
on everything that I make.

20:04.971 --> 20:08.841
I'm just making sure that the
handle feels good in the hand.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.777
I think I'm gonna
leave the blade alone

20:10.810 --> 20:13.346
and try not
to cut myself anymore.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.915
Save that for the coconuts.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.884
- Oh, look, look, look.

20:17.917 --> 20:21.388
- He's doing exactly
what you said he was gonna do.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.856
So Storm is shaping
the handle material

20:23.890 --> 20:25.725
around the flaws in his tang

20:25.758 --> 20:28.561
rather than straighten
the whole profile of the blade.

20:28.595 --> 20:29.862
- It's a little kooky.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.264
- I'm feeling pretty good.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.600
My handle's mostly shaped.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.035
I wasn't able to get the slight
warp out of the handle,

20:36.068 --> 20:38.738
but I know that
the blade is straight,

20:38.771 --> 20:41.474
so although it might change
the cutting angle a little bit,

20:41.508 --> 20:43.976
it's a risk that
I'm willing to take.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.546
- The handle looks
a little bit rounded,

20:46.579 --> 20:48.315
a little bit like a broomstick.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.350
- You can't index
anything that's round.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.884
What do you think, Doug,
about broomstick handles?

20:51.918 --> 20:53.520
- Uh, they're great
for broomsticks.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.788
- Ah.
- [laughing]

20:55.822 --> 20:56.989
- That was a good one.

20:57.023 --> 21:00.727
*

21:00.760 --> 21:02.762
- I just wanted to test my edge
on the wood.

21:02.795 --> 21:06.799
I figure, if I can chop
into a 2x6 without any dimples,

21:06.833 --> 21:07.967
then I should be all right
on a coconut.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.605
*

21:12.639 --> 21:14.774
- Now my epoxy is dried
and I'm gonna get started

21:14.807 --> 21:17.877
on finishing up my blade
and shaping my handle.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.579
I wanna hand sand it,

21:19.612 --> 21:21.481
but I don't have time
to do that.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.983
- He's right up around the neck
of that handle again.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.018
- Hopefully he doesn't go right
back to the shape he was at.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.887
- That'd be heartbreaking.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.789
- I feel like the handle
is indexing well,

21:29.822 --> 21:31.524
and is fairly balanced.

21:31.558 --> 21:33.893
I think it will do well
in the judges' hands.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.828
*

21:35.862 --> 21:38.798
- Ten, nine, eight,

21:38.831 --> 21:41.934
seven, six, five,

21:41.968 --> 21:44.036
four, three,

21:44.070 --> 21:45.972
two, one.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.441
Bladesmiths, drop your tools.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.578
This round is over.
- Time's up.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.746
The real question is gonna be:

21:53.780 --> 21:55.448
what happened
during the heat treat?

21:55.482 --> 21:57.484
How is the steel gonna respond?

21:57.517 --> 21:59.786
We'll find out.
- [sighs]

21:59.819 --> 22:01.721
Even though I wasn't able
to remove the warp

22:01.754 --> 22:04.557
that I had in the handle,
I'm confident that I addressed

22:04.591 --> 22:06.993
the other issues the judges
brought to my attention.

22:07.026 --> 22:10.463
So, it's up in the air.
It could be anybody's game.

22:10.497 --> 22:13.099
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the strength test.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.902
You each get three coconuts,
one shot each.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.405
Remember, this is not about
what happens to the coconuts.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.006
It's about what happens
to your knife.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.474
Neil, you're up first.
Are you ready?

22:21.508 --> 22:23.710
- Yes, sir.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.445
J. is about
to take the first chop,

22:25.478 --> 22:28.381
and I can't even breathe.
I'm so nervous.

22:28.415 --> 22:35.354
*

22:39.859 --> 22:42.562
- Neil, it chopped cleanly,
it felt comfortable.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.930
Got a little bit
of a curve to the blade,

22:43.963 --> 22:46.499
but you had that before.
Your edge held up fine.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.034
Nice job, Neil.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.669
- Thank you.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.170
Being from Hawaii,

22:51.203 --> 22:53.840
if I had a knife
that didn't cut a coconut,

22:53.873 --> 22:55.842
I would never hear
the end of it.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.644
- You ready, Dan?
- Yes, sir.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.846
- Let's do it.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.748
- I'm concerned that
the thin edge profile

23:01.781 --> 23:03.616
of my blade might chip.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.885
If I can make it past
the coconut chop,

23:05.918 --> 23:08.120
I'll be feeling good.

23:08.154 --> 23:15.027
*

23:19.165 --> 23:20.967
- Dan, I was concerned

23:21.000 --> 23:23.736
because you have
a much thinner edge here,

23:23.770 --> 23:26.205
but apparently you dialed
the heat treat in just right.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.441
You did take some of our advice

23:28.475 --> 23:31.611
by reducing some of
this thickness here.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.012
I wish it had been a bit more,

23:33.045 --> 23:36.215
because you have
that bend in the blade.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.217
It's not in-line with my hand,

23:38.250 --> 23:40.687
but, uh, it held up tight.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.723
Nice job, Dan.
- Thank you.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.593
- Storm, what are you thinking?

23:46.626 --> 23:47.994
- I'm nervous.
Very nervous.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.161
- Well, we're gonna
do it anyway.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.163
- Yes, sir.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.533
I tested my blade out,
but what I tested it on

23:53.566 --> 23:55.835
is definitely not as hard as
a coconut exterior shell,

23:55.868 --> 23:58.638
so I'm just hoping it holds up.

23:58.671 --> 24:05.612
*

24:13.019 --> 24:13.953
[exhales]

24:16.556 --> 24:19.492
- Storm, we've got
some definitely edge damage,

24:21.961 --> 24:26.198
I'm worried that
all of that over-forging,.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.968
continually heating,
straightening,

24:29.001 --> 24:31.938
might have pulled some of
the strength out of your blade.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.606
Your handle stayed tight,
though.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.842
I appreciate the fact
that you have,

24:35.875 --> 24:37.577
you know, that little bit
of belly on there.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.145
That helps me hold on to it.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.913
Didn't hold up 100%,

24:40.947 --> 24:42.248
but you still did
a very nice job.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.083
- Thank you kindly.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.252
- To test the sharpness
of your blade,

24:46.285 --> 24:49.922
I will take your blade and slash
across these ratchet straps.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.791
Neil, you're up first.
You ready?

24:51.824 --> 24:53.225
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

24:53.259 --> 24:56.295
- Okay.
I feel extremely nervous

24:56.328 --> 24:59.899
because I'm not 100% confident
that I got my blade sharp.

24:59.932 --> 25:06.873
*

25:08.841 --> 25:11.177
- Well, Neil, as I see,
you made the little adjustments

25:11.210 --> 25:14.080
that we requested.
Your little finger weld there

25:14.113 --> 25:16.115
did not get in the way.

25:16.148 --> 25:20.019
It's very smooth,
but it feels good in the hand.

25:20.052 --> 25:23.890
Overall, your blade will cut.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.091
- Right on.
- Good job.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.026
Dan, you're up next.
You ready?

25:27.059 --> 25:28.895
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.963
- I'm glad that
it's Doug handling the knife

25:30.997 --> 25:33.633
instead of me
because my palms are so sweaty,

25:33.666 --> 25:35.267
I wouldn't be able
to keep a grip.

25:35.301 --> 25:42.041
*

25:42.074 --> 25:43.776
- All right, Dan,
let's talk about your blade.

25:43.810 --> 25:47.146
Your handle,
I like the way it feels.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.682
It's got a good grip,
nice finger swell right there

25:49.716 --> 25:51.751
so I can hold on to your blade.
It sliced nicely.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.821
It feels good in the hand,
but when you look at it,

25:54.854 --> 25:57.356
you still have
a slight warp to that,

25:57.389 --> 26:00.727
but overall,
your blade will cut.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.128
- Thank you.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.096
- All right, Storm,
it's your turn.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.364
You ready?
- More than ever.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.299
- Let's do this.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.669
- The biggest concern
for me at this point is:

26:09.702 --> 26:12.872
I've got an edge that chipped
and rolled a little bit.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.174
So if I don't
get through all five,

26:15.207 --> 26:24.050
I'm going home.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.718
[exhales]

26:25.752 --> 26:28.254
*

26:28.287 --> 26:30.389
- Okay, Storm,
let's talk about your blade.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.092
It is one
of the smoothest handles

26:33.125 --> 26:35.261
we've ever had
from a second round.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.029
Good job on that.
- Thank you.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.631
- Here's some
of the issues, though.

26:38.665 --> 26:40.633
It's a small handle.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.969
When you're working with blades
that are bigger than your hand,

26:43.002 --> 26:44.303
it becomes blade heavy.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.172
You start chopping
and hitting around it,

26:46.205 --> 26:48.174
it wants to leave the hand
'cause it's so smooth.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.209
Your blade here
almost has serrations now.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.044
It grabbed on
to the ratchet straps

26:52.078 --> 26:53.379
and cut all the way through.

26:53.412 --> 26:56.649
Overall, your blade will cut.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.017
- I've waited a long time
to hear that.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.352
Thank you.
[both chuckle]

27:00.386 --> 27:02.288
*

27:02.321 --> 27:05.091
- Bladesmiths, the judges have
made their final decision.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.959
*

27:06.993 --> 27:08.828
It's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

27:08.861 --> 27:13.232
*

27:13.265 --> 27:15.835
Storm, your blade
did not make the cut.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.870
*

27:17.904 --> 27:20.139
- You know, Storm,
your energy and enthusiasm

27:20.172 --> 27:22.742
in the Forge
was amazing to watch.

27:22.775 --> 27:25.177
I mean, you've obviously got
a passion for this,

27:25.211 --> 27:27.446
and you produced a fine piece,

27:27.479 --> 27:30.116
but the forging and
the heat treat on your blade

27:30.149 --> 27:31.450
just couldn't stand up
to the strength test

27:31.483 --> 27:32.952
with those coconuts,
so that's why

27:32.985 --> 27:34.053
we have to send you home today.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.455
- Completely understood.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.858
- Storm,
please surrender your blade.

27:38.891 --> 27:43.062
*

27:43.095 --> 27:44.430
- Would have been nice
to go further,

27:44.463 --> 27:46.265
but it's the way
the cards fell,

27:46.298 --> 27:49.769
and that unfortunately led
to me going home.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.971
Failure isn't fatal
and success isn't final.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.372
It's the courage that counts.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.241
So I'll keep living
by that motto

27:55.274 --> 27:57.209
and moving forward.

27:57.243 --> 28:01.147
*

28:01.180 --> 28:02.882
- Congratulations,
bladesmiths.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.483
Your work has elevated you

28:04.516 --> 28:07.053
to the third round
of this competition.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.221
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

28:09.255 --> 28:12.491
so that you can re-create
an iconic weapon from history,

28:12.524 --> 28:15.061
and that weapon is...

28:15.094 --> 28:16.729
the cinquedea.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.264
*

28:18.297 --> 28:20.499
Developed in Italy
during the Renaissance,

28:20.532 --> 28:24.070
the cinquedea gained popularity
amongst civilian noblemen.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.438
This large double-edged sword
delivered lethal cuts

28:26.472 --> 28:28.240
in close-quarter attacks

28:28.274 --> 28:30.076
and was worn on the hip
to be swiftly drawn

28:30.109 --> 28:31.944
in times of
threatening encounters.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.313
Derived from the Italian word
for the number five,

28:34.346 --> 28:36.215
the name "cinquedea" represents

28:36.248 --> 28:38.951
the blade measuring
five-fingers wide at the base,

28:38.985 --> 28:40.352
which became
an excellent canvas

28:40.386 --> 28:41.988
for intricate artwork.

28:42.021 --> 28:43.355
With functionality in mind,

28:43.389 --> 28:45.324
swordsmiths also
included fullers

28:45.357 --> 28:47.894
to lighten the weight
of this otherwise heavy sword.

28:47.927 --> 28:50.096
Although the cinquedea
lost its popularity

28:50.129 --> 28:53.265
after the 16th century,
it has recently made a comeback

28:53.299 --> 28:56.168
in the video game
"Assassin's Creed."

28:56.202 --> 28:58.037
*

28:58.070 --> 29:00.072
Your weapon must be
at least four inches at the base

29:00.106 --> 29:01.407
and tapered to a point.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.110
Both edged must be sharpened,

29:04.143 --> 29:07.513
and include at least
two fullers on each side.

29:07.546 --> 29:10.850
Your handle should have
a crescent guard and pommel.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.451
After five days,
you will return

29:12.484 --> 29:15.154
to present your work
to our panel of expert judges.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.989
Good luck, bladesmiths.

29:17.023 --> 29:18.524

29:18.557 --> 29:21.427
[rock music]

29:21.460 --> 29:23.429
- Day one in Tallahassee.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.032
This is my first time working
on a double-sided blade.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.834
Single-sided blade,

29:27.867 --> 29:30.202
you've got a lot more freedom
in the geometry,

29:30.236 --> 29:33.305
but a double-sided blade,
it all has to match.

29:33.339 --> 29:36.508
I gotta measure every tidbit.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.577
I want it to look nice

29:38.610 --> 29:40.446
but also feel stable
in the hand

29:40.479 --> 29:42.314
as you're swinging it.

29:42.348 --> 29:45.551
Boy, howdy.
It weighs a ton.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.319
The advantage of this
small pass-through forge

29:47.353 --> 29:48.988
is it's open at both ends,

29:49.021 --> 29:51.090
and I can heat
the entire length of the blade,

29:51.123 --> 29:52.458
but it's not gonna work.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.260
It's losing heat

29:54.293 --> 29:57.163
because it's not
very well insulated.

29:57.196 --> 29:59.331
So I gotta do something
I had wanted to avoid,

29:59.365 --> 30:02.401
which is cut a hole in
the back of my primary forge.

30:02.434 --> 30:05.204
It's time that
I can't afford to lose.

30:05.237 --> 30:08.040
[upbeat music]

30:08.074 --> 30:10.309
- We're here at my home forge
in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii,

30:10.342 --> 30:12.478
on the big island.

30:12.511 --> 30:15.982
This is gonna be the most
challenging I've made so far.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.184
I don't even know
how to pronounce it.

30:18.217 --> 30:21.020
I'm using a lead spring
that I got at a junkyard.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.989
I find there's a beauty
in taking something

30:23.022 --> 30:24.590
that somebody would throw away

30:24.623 --> 30:26.959
and making it into something
that I keep forever.

30:26.993 --> 30:29.095
So I'm trying to incorporate
the rest of this metal

30:29.128 --> 30:31.931
into an integral guard
by bending these pieces down.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.033
I literally
do everything by eye.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.568
I rarely measure anything.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.170
You know, so it's not gonna be

30:38.204 --> 30:40.172
this perfectly
symmetrical piece,

30:40.206 --> 30:42.241
but it's gonna have
the hand-felt look.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.376
They didn't do it back then
on some machine.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.145
They were doing it by hand.

30:46.178 --> 30:49.148
This acute swell is
not comfortable in your hand.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.017
It's, like, the opposite.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.985
I've got the shape outlined.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.421
I got the fullers started.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.990
I'm excited to do this.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.125
[rock music]

30:59.158 --> 31:00.960
- It's day three.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.962
Having to cut a hole
in the back of my forge

31:02.995 --> 31:04.931
took some time,
but I feel like

31:04.964 --> 31:06.465
I made good progress
on the blade.

31:06.498 --> 31:09.168
I've got it profiled
the way that I want.

31:09.201 --> 31:12.939
It feels a lot better
in the hand now.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.474
So now it's coming
to the most challenging part:

31:15.507 --> 31:17.509
putting in the fullers.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.912
So I've got the blade
in the mill,

31:19.946 --> 31:21.647
and the milling bit is

31:21.680 --> 31:24.383
just skating
right over the surface.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.252
It's polishing,
it's not cutting.

31:26.285 --> 31:27.920
[grunts]
So option B is

31:27.954 --> 31:29.922
to try free-handing it
with a file,

31:29.956 --> 31:32.992
and the file was just dancing
over the surface of the blade,

31:33.025 --> 31:36.228
so option C is to try
to free-hand it on the grinder.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.297
That just looks terrible.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.933
This is, like,
a perfect storm of anxiety.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.401
Doing something
for the first time

31:42.434 --> 31:43.635
that's very challenging...

31:43.669 --> 31:46.005
How to solve this problem?

31:46.038 --> 31:48.507
$10,000 on the line.

31:48.540 --> 31:52.611
So I use a smaller milling bit,
and low and behold,

31:52.644 --> 31:54.513
it just starts biting
into that steel

31:54.546 --> 31:57.083
just the way I want it to.
It's cutting a slot.

31:57.116 --> 31:59.185
Smiths who are sneering at me

31:59.218 --> 32:00.552
for not forging 'em in...

32:00.586 --> 32:02.254
[blows raspberry]

32:02.288 --> 32:04.523
- Day three
and it's hard to sleep

32:04.556 --> 32:07.659
'cause all I think about
is this sword.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.029
*

32:10.062 --> 32:12.164
I wanna show to the judges
that I'm not afraid of work,

32:12.198 --> 32:15.434
and that I can accomplish
something that I put my mind to.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.336
It's the most important step.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.371
I'm about to hit a heat treat.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.240
I couldn't wait
to do it all day

32:21.273 --> 32:22.574
and now that it's time,
I'm scared

32:22.608 --> 32:24.310
because it could fail.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.112
Worse-case scenario,

32:26.145 --> 32:28.680
my blade could warp,
it could crack.

32:28.714 --> 32:31.650
And then I would have to start
all over again.

[dramatic music]

No warps,
no bends.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.461
It was straight.

[exhales]

32:45.764 --> 32:47.099
It's hard.

So I'm happy.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.302
This is still a competition.

32:50.336 --> 32:53.205
It's not like
the stress is off.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.774
Anything could happen
at any given time.

[rock music]

32:57.409 --> 32:58.677

It's time for the heat treat.

33:01.047 --> 33:03.615
My heart is beating fast.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.784
It's just this feeling,
this culmination,

33:05.817 --> 33:07.619
it's the climax of the story.

keep this blads blade strai,

Don't you do it.
Don't you do it.

I'm relieved.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.664

I can finish now.

Now it's just a matter
of assembling the pieces,

fit and finished,

with the guard a little bit

a little bit more fancy.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.451
I'm feeling the pressure

because David Baker

are gonna look at it
extremely closely,

I feel confident

34:22.328 --> 34:24.530
that my blade is strong,

34:24.563 --> 34:26.332
and I would take it to battle.

What do you think?
You think it could win?

to work on your cinquedeas.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.594
Dan, how did it go?

34:55.627 --> 34:57.463
- There were a lot of challenges
to overcome,

34:57.496 --> 34:59.798
but things fell into place.

34:59.831 --> 35:02.134
I tried to emulate
the bone handles

35:02.168 --> 35:03.769
that they were
typically constructed with

35:03.802 --> 35:07.173
by using white Corian.
I'm ready to see it put to use.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.774
- All right.
Neil, tell us about your weapon.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.709
- I wasn't planning
on making it this far,

35:10.742 --> 35:13.879
so I had to go to the junkyard
and grab a bunch of stuff

35:13.912 --> 35:15.914
and put something together.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.416
I hope it works good.
[laughter]

35:17.449 --> 35:19.551
All right, man.
That's awesome.

Now it's time to see
how they hold up

35:20.786 --> 35:21.920
in our weapons test.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.156
Up first, the kill test.

Doug?
- The cinquedea was used

35:26.292 --> 35:28.694
for civilian dress,
but it served one purpose:

35:28.727 --> 35:30.796
to kill.
I will take your weapon

35:30.829 --> 35:33.532
and deliver killing blows
to this big carcass.

35:33.565 --> 35:34.833
Dan, you're up first.
You ready?

35:34.866 --> 35:36.868
- Yes, sir.
I'm a little concerned

35:36.902 --> 35:39.271
when I see how well-constructed
Neil's blade is,

35:39.305 --> 35:41.873

a 50/50 chance of winning.

35:57.556 --> 36:01.193
cut all the way through
and lacerated the ribs.

36:01.227 --> 36:04.630
On the other edge,
it cut the spine in half.

36:04.663 --> 36:08.600
The balance of the blade makes
it very wieldable in combat.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.869
Your weapon will kill.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.638
- Thank you.
- All right, Neil.

36:12.671 --> 36:13.972
Are you ready?
- Ready.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.708
- Let's do this.

36:16.742 --> 36:23.682
*

36:27.018 --> 36:28.887
- [exhales]

36:28.920 --> 36:32.924
- Okay, Neil, this is heavier
compared to Dan's blade,

36:32.958 --> 36:35.727
but the edges are sharp enough

36:35.761 --> 36:38.397
to lacerate the spine
all the way through.

36:38.430 --> 36:42.434
The base and the weight allows
for a power slash.

36:42.468 --> 36:45.604
Overall,
your cinquedea will kill.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.273
Good job.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.808
- My son is going to flip out.

36:49.841 --> 36:52.578
He was just--he was just like,
"Just make sure it kills,

36:52.611 --> 36:55.381
so Doug can say it."
[laughs]

36:55.414 --> 36:56.615
So, mission accomplished.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.917
- Up next is the sharpness test.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.820
We will test both of the edges
of your blades

37:01.853 --> 37:05.457
by delivering a strike
across these ratchet straps.

37:05.491 --> 37:06.592
Dan, you're up first.
You ready?

37:06.625 --> 37:07.793
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

37:07.826 --> 37:11.797
*

37:11.830 --> 37:14.733
[rock music]

37:14.766 --> 37:16.835
*

37:16.868 --> 37:17.803
[dramatic music]

37:17.836 --> 37:19.905
My hand will tend to

37:19.938 --> 37:21.873
choke up all the way
to the guard.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.876
This weight distribution
basically pulls the blade away.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.378
Definitely the sword
on both sides

37:26.412 --> 37:28.046
is easy enough to slash through

37:28.079 --> 37:31.517
and deliver a slice that
cut through all these ratchets.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.585
Your blade, sir, will cut.

37:33.619 --> 37:34.986
- Thank you.
- Good job.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.523
Neil, your turn.
You ready?

37:37.556 --> 37:38.790
- Ready.
- Let's do this.

37:38.824 --> 37:45.731
*

37:48.634 --> 37:51.437
- The dimensions of your handle
really fit my hand.

37:51.470 --> 37:55.073
Anywhere I go, it stays
right where it has to be.

37:55.106 --> 37:58.644
Your edge easily cut through
these ratchets on both sides.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.712
Your blade will cut.
Good job.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.481
- Right on.
[both chuckle]

38:02.514 --> 38:05.351
- Next up is the strength test.
Dave.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.085
- Gentlemen, to test
the strength of your weapon,

38:07.118 --> 38:09.755
I'm going to chop
into this ice block four times

38:09.788 --> 38:11.990
with each edge of your sword.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.659
- My heart just sinks.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.761
That was the one test
I was hoping

38:15.794 --> 38:17.563
we were not going to have.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.331
- Dan, you're up.
Are you ready?

38:19.365 --> 38:20.666
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

38:20.699 --> 38:23.935
- I chose to go
for mobility and sharpness

38:23.969 --> 38:25.971
rather than durability,

38:26.004 --> 38:26.972
so something bad might happen.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.812
[rock music]

38:33.845 --> 38:37.849
*

38:37.883 --> 38:39.418
- Now the other side.

38:39.451 --> 38:46.358
*

38:49.595 --> 38:51.096
[tense music]

38:51.129 --> 38:53.098
- Well, I don't see any chipping
or warping,

38:53.131 --> 38:55.701
so the edge held up very nicely.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.670
That guard is so lean
that as I'm striking,

38:58.704 --> 39:00.706
the blade wants
to turn on my hand...

39:00.739 --> 39:03.475
- Okay.
- But it did a good job.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.411
Nicely done.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.446
So, Neil, your turn.
You ready?

39:07.479 --> 39:09.114
- Ready.

39:09.147 --> 39:12.017
I'm so nervous
because if you say

39:12.050 --> 39:14.085
that you can commit to coming
to this type of competition

39:14.119 --> 39:15.854
and you can't live up to it,

39:15.887 --> 39:17.122
you're not doing
what you're saying.

39:17.155 --> 39:19.458
For me,
I take that really serious.

39:19.491 --> 39:22.428
[rock music]

39:22.461 --> 39:26.432
*

39:26.465 --> 39:28.099
- Now the other side.

39:28.133 --> 39:35.073
*

39:36.875 --> 39:39.110
- [exhales]

39:39.144 --> 39:40.912
- This is heavy.

39:40.946 --> 39:44.015
You see the cinquedeas
with the multiple fullers,

39:44.049 --> 39:46.918
and the purpose of that
is to take that mass out of it.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.854
It's not balanced badly
because you've got

39:48.887 --> 39:51.089
really thick tang on there.

39:51.122 --> 39:55.026
I see no damage,
I can't feel any rolling,

39:55.060 --> 39:56.728
so it held up beautifully.
Nicely done.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.464
- Thank you.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.131
[dramatic music]

40:00.165 --> 40:03.068
- Dan, Neil, the judges have
completed their deliberation,

40:03.101 --> 40:05.537
but before I tell you
their final decision,

40:05.571 --> 40:07.539
they have some feedback
for both of you.

40:07.573 --> 40:10.642
- Neil, the scale
of your blade to your handle

40:10.676 --> 40:12.544
is just so dialed in,

40:12.578 --> 40:14.145
and even though
it's a heavy piece,

40:14.179 --> 40:15.681
it feels right in the hand.

40:15.714 --> 40:18.083
- Thank you.
- Doug?

40:18.116 --> 40:20.952
- Dan, the cinquedea
that you presented

40:20.986 --> 40:23.121
is beautiful
and it's very deadly.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.791
It's strong, it's sharp,
and it will kill.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.893
Good job.
- Thank you.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.496
- Gentlemen,
you've both done fantastic work,

40:30.529 --> 40:32.030
but in this arena
of competition,

40:32.063 --> 40:34.099
there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion.

40:34.132 --> 40:38.570
*

40:38.604 --> 40:40.772
- Neil, congratulations.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.073
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.009
*

40:44.042 --> 40:47.078
Dan, unfortunately,
your blade did not make the cut.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.647
David Baker will explain.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.816
- Dan, you brought us
a beautiful piece.

40:50.849 --> 40:52.784
And I appreciate all the work
that went into this,

40:52.818 --> 40:55.554
and this was
a really tight decision,

40:55.587 --> 40:57.055
and what it really came down to

40:57.088 --> 40:58.957
was the connection
of that handle

40:58.990 --> 41:01.226
to the blade
and the fit of that guard,

41:01.259 --> 41:03.962
and how it turned in my hand
when I was chopping that ice

41:03.995 --> 41:06.498
and kind of bit in.
Those small things,

41:06.532 --> 41:08.767
those transition points,
they can be a killer,

41:08.800 --> 41:10.268
and that's why
we're letting you go.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.603
- I understand.
Thank you.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.004
- Dan, it's that time.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.172
Please surrender your weapon.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.974
*

41:16.007 --> 41:17.943
- I came here to win,
I wanted to win,

41:17.976 --> 41:20.579
but Neil made something
that was better.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.714
I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna go back to my life,

41:22.748 --> 41:24.149
and I'm gonna go back
to my craft.

41:24.182 --> 41:26.718
I still love bladesmithing.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.186
*

41:28.219 --> 41:30.021
- Neil, you picked
a hell of a way

41:30.055 --> 41:31.256
to tell the world
that you're here.

41:31.289 --> 41:32.824
Congratulations.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.593
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion,

41:34.626 --> 41:37.195
and will be receiving that check
for $10,000.

41:37.228 --> 41:38.697
What are you feeling
right now?

41:38.730 --> 41:40.165
- It's overwhelming.
[chuckles]

41:40.198 --> 41:43.068
- Great job.
[applause]

41:43.101 --> 41:45.771
- My son is going to be ecstatic

41:45.804 --> 41:47.005
that I won.
[laughs]

41:47.038 --> 41:48.173
We've been watching this show

41:48.206 --> 41:50.776
on the couch last season,

41:50.809 --> 41:52.711
for to me being on it.

41:52.744 --> 41:54.980
"Forged in Fire" champion.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.148
That's me.
[laughs]

41:57.182 --> 41:58.917
So crazy.

41:58.950 --> 42:03.254
