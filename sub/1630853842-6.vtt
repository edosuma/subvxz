00:52.635 --> 00:53.511
Heads up!

00:55.221 --> 00:57.849
Sorry, man. Nice catch, though.

00:59.517 --> 01:00.351
Thank you.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.067
Franklin.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.944
Come on, Franklin. What you waitin' for?

01:22.290 --> 01:23.249
What are you doin'?

01:25.335 --> 01:26.544
I'm feeding the pigeons.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.425
"You do that too much,
you know what you get?"

01:34.344 --> 01:35.345
"Fat pigeons."

01:39.390 --> 01:41.643
That's from Mary Poppins.
Did you ever see it?

01:42.519 --> 01:43.353
No.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.530
Okay, so what's the matter?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.198
What do you mean?

01:55.281 --> 01:58.451
I can tell something's wrong.
I mean, look at you.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.871
Sittin' here, moping, pigeon-feeding.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.040
It's not like you.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.086
No. Perhaps it isn't.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.463
I don't know what's wrong, but…

02:12.215 --> 02:13.133
You're right.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.427
Something is the matter.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.355
When they captured me,
I just had one thought.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.067
Vengeance.

02:32.735 --> 02:35.113
It wasn't as satisfying as I'd expected.

02:36.447 --> 02:39.367
Meanwhile, my kingdom had fallen apart.

02:40.535 --> 02:44.622
My tools long since stolen and scattered.

02:46.166 --> 02:50.253
And so I embarked upon
a journey to find them.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.256
Which I did.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.011
I'm now more powerful
than I have been in eons.

02:59.929 --> 03:00.847
And yet…

03:06.686 --> 03:08.396
Here you are, feeding the pigeons.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.357
You see, until then,

03:13.526 --> 03:15.486
I'd had a true quest.

03:16.779 --> 03:21.659
A purpose beyond my function
and then suddenly, it was over, and…

03:24.787 --> 03:26.372
I felt disappointed.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.459
Let down.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.170
Empty.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.422
Does that make sense?

03:34.923 --> 03:38.343
I was so sure that once
I got everything back, I'd feel good.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.764
But in some ways
I feel worse than when I started.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.682
I feel like…

03:48.228 --> 03:49.145
Nothing.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.150
There.

03:55.693 --> 03:56.653
You asked.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.370
You could have called me, you know.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.163
I didn't want to worry you.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.582
Oh, I don't believe it.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.043
Let me tell you something, Dream.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.505
And I'm only gonna say this once,
so you better pay attention.

04:15.588 --> 04:19.133
You are utterly the stupidest,

04:19.217 --> 04:23.137
most self-centered, pathetic excuse
for an anthropomorphic personification

04:23.221 --> 04:25.473
on this or any other plane.

04:25.556 --> 04:29.018
Feeling sorry for yourself
because your little game is over

04:29.102 --> 04:32.313
and you haven't got the balls
to go out and find a new one.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.692
You're as bad as Desire.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.193
No, worse.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.615
Did it never occur to you
that I would be worried about you?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.200
-I didn't think you--
-Exactly.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.369
You didn't think.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.496
Heads up!

04:50.498 --> 04:51.332
Wow.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.003
You're as good as your… friend there.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.840
He's not my friend. He's my brother.
And he's an idiot.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.425
I'm just feeding the birds.

05:03.177 --> 05:06.848
Look, I can't stay here all day.
I've got work to do.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.270
You can come with me if you want,
or you can stay here and sulk.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.065
I'll come with you, I suppose.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.651
Well, don't do me any favors.

05:24.824 --> 05:29.412
Sorry, before you go,
um, could I maybe see you again?

05:29.996 --> 05:32.582
Sure, Franklin. You'll see me again.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.083
Seriously?

05:35.084 --> 05:35.918
Soon.

05:36.836 --> 05:37.837
Okay, cool.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.423
Yeah, let me just get your number and…

05:41.632 --> 05:42.967
Wait, how did you know my…

05:47.180 --> 05:49.640
Come on, Franklin!
Are you playin' or not?

05:54.729 --> 05:55.938
Look!

05:56.022 --> 05:58.441
Yum!

05:58.524 --> 05:59.567
Okay, two, please.

05:59.650 --> 06:00.860
None for me, thank you.

06:00.943 --> 06:01.986
They're good for you.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.988
-I'm not hungry.
-You can just have it later.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.285
Just one. Thanks.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.456
-There you go. It's a gift.
-Thank you.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.708
Aw. Thank you.

06:16.667 --> 06:17.627
So nice.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.589
Mmm. That is delicious.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.383
What?

06:27.345 --> 06:28.513
You are good with them.

06:29.597 --> 06:30.431
Apples?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.476
-Humans.
-Mmm.

06:34.936 --> 06:35.770
Bite?

06:36.896 --> 06:37.897
No, thank you.

06:40.817 --> 06:44.529
Hmm. Have you seen any of the others
since you've been back?

06:46.697 --> 06:47.532
Have you?

06:49.033 --> 06:50.493
Mmm… Mmm.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.121
We did have one family dinner
when you were away.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.123
The twins were in high spirits.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.583
Mmm, Desire was, anyway.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.294
With me gone, I have no doubt.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.089
I don't know.

07:03.172 --> 07:05.842
I think Desire missed having
their usual sparring partner

07:05.925 --> 07:07.051
across the dinner table.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.139
Any word of the prodigal?

07:13.391 --> 07:14.225
No.

07:15.393 --> 07:16.394
Still missing.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.689
You were both missed.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.239
"How are you, sis?"

07:28.322 --> 07:29.866
"How have you been keeping?"

07:29.949 --> 07:33.244
Aw. I'm well, Dream. Thanks for asking.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.082
How are you, my sister?

07:39.041 --> 07:40.376
How have you been keeping?

07:42.628 --> 07:44.088
I'm worried about my brother.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.967
And I'm enjoying this apple.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.015
Can you hear it?

07:58.561 --> 07:59.896
I know this piece.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.776
I haven't heard it in 200 years.

08:10.823 --> 08:11.657
Come on.

08:27.798 --> 08:31.719
No. Don't stop, please.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.056
Uh, sorry for the noise.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.849
It's not noise. It's Schubert.

08:38.100 --> 08:38.935
Keep going.

08:39.018 --> 08:42.021
I can't. He never finished it.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.690
All we have is a fragment.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.069
Oh, forgive me, I… I am Harry.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.030
I know who you are, Harry.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.331
Do you know who I am?

09:07.088 --> 09:09.924
No. Not yet. Please.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.343
It's time.

09:17.473 --> 09:18.432
Can I just…

09:19.976 --> 09:23.229
There's something I have to say.
If that's all right.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.188
Of course.

09:40.496 --> 09:46.961
Hear, O
The Lord is our God. The Lord is One.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.231
I'm glad I said the Shema.

10:07.773 --> 10:11.819
My old man always said
it would guarantee you a place in Heaven.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.572
If you believe in Heaven.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.698
Hmm?

10:20.328 --> 10:21.954
I look so old.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.665
So empty.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.504
So, I'm dead.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.007
Now what?

10:34.216 --> 10:35.968
Now's when you find out, Harry.

10:59.158 --> 10:59.992
You ready?

11:15.299 --> 11:17.426
I thought he was sweet. Didn't you?

11:18.678 --> 11:21.138
Sweet? I don't know.

11:22.556 --> 11:23.391
Perhaps.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.020
My sister…

11:28.688 --> 11:29.522
Yeah?

11:31.148 --> 11:33.901
When I was captured,
it wasn't me they were looking for.

11:36.612 --> 11:37.446
It was you.

11:41.992 --> 11:45.413
Yeah, I know.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.338
What are you doing?

11:54.422 --> 11:55.673
I'm taking my shoes off.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.967
You should take yours off too.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.469
It's good to touch the Earth
with your bare feet.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.346
It's grounding.

12:03.472 --> 12:06.100
Come on,
I don't want to miss the next one.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.531
Hi, Sam.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.160
Oh.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.872
Hi. I'm sorry. Do I know you?

12:35.379 --> 12:36.255
Oh, no.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.884
No, no.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.720
I need to talk to my wife
for, like, one second.

12:42.803 --> 12:43.679
Sam…

12:43.763 --> 12:44.847
You don't understand.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.475
All our flight information is on my phone.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.226
I just need to give her the code.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.395
I'm so sorry, Sam.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.147
But we're on our honeymoon.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.273
Your time is up.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.026
Sam?

13:03.866 --> 13:04.742
Sam?

13:06.160 --> 13:07.077
Come on, hon.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.009
Sam!

13:25.596 --> 13:26.555
Sam!

13:28.682 --> 13:31.977
Sam… Sam!

13:32.728 --> 13:34.021
How do you do it?

13:34.688 --> 13:36.106
-Do what?
-This.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.317
Be there, for all of them?

13:41.529 --> 13:44.323
I have a job to do. And I do it.

13:46.742 --> 13:50.371
When the first living thing existed,
I was there.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.583
When the last living thing dies,
I'll put the chairs on the table,

13:54.667 --> 13:56.210
turn out the lights and…

13:57.127 --> 13:59.296
lock the universe behind me when I leave.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.216
And I'm not there for all of them.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.010
There are exceptions.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.388
Mad Hettie.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.224
And then there's your ongoing project.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.893
How's he faring up after all this time?

14:12.977 --> 14:15.855
-Who? Hob Gadling?
-Hmm.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.483
I don't know.
I was forced to miss our last appointment.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.778
Well, I'm sure he'd love to see you.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.031
They're never too keen to see me, though.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.201
Does it not bother you?

14:30.494 --> 14:34.290
I actually used to think
I had the hardest job in all our family.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.291
Oh, did you?

14:35.374 --> 14:36.792
They fear the Sunless Lands,

14:36.876 --> 14:39.962
yet they enter your realm
every night without fear.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.798
And yet I am far more terrible than you.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.178
It was fine in the beginning.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.514
Dying and living were new things

14:50.598 --> 14:54.560
and people did them with the enthusiasm
they always bring to new things.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.565
And then after a bit, it just got harder.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.442
But you continued.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.239
I thought about giving up.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.701
Walking out.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.836
This was a long time ago,
long before this world.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.422
It really started to get to me.

15:23.505 --> 15:26.050
I got kind of hard and brittle inside.

15:26.759 --> 15:32.097
I mean, people feel as pleased to have
been born as if they did it themselves.

15:33.307 --> 15:39.396
But they get upset and hurt
and shaken when they die.

15:39.897 --> 15:44.401
But eventually,
I learned that all they really need

15:44.485 --> 15:48.197
is a kind word and a friendly face.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.824
Like they had in the beginning.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.868
-Hello.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.079
Hello, baby girl.

15:55.579 --> 15:56.747
Are you hungry?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.917
Mum had better get your bottle, then.

16:15.474 --> 16:19.186
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.106
That's all there is, little one.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.941
That's all you get.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.873
All right, sweetie. Lunch time.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.501
We can go.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.796
We'll do some eating,

16:46.714 --> 16:49.133
then maybe another nap for Mummy's sake.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.885
Then maybe the park?

16:53.470 --> 16:54.346
Lovey?

16:55.014 --> 16:58.225
I find myself
wondering about humanity.

16:58.308 --> 17:02.104
Their attitude towards your gift
is so strange.

17:05.399 --> 17:08.152
Why do they fear the Sunless Lands?

17:10.195 --> 17:12.990
It is as natural to die
as it is to be born.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.456
People may not
be ready for my gift.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.542
But they get it anyway.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.420
No matter what the circumstance.

17:58.118 --> 18:01.371
At the end, each of us stands alone.

18:03.165 --> 18:07.419
The Sunless Lands are far away
and the journey is hard.

18:09.713 --> 18:13.425
Most of us will be glad
for the company of a friend.

18:19.014 --> 18:21.100
It's funny looking back now.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.686
I used to think
I had to do this all by myself.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.481
But you do.

18:29.817 --> 18:30.651
No.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.030
At the end, I'm there with them.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.700
I'm holding their hand
and they're holding mine.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.995
I'm not alone when I'm doing my job.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.499
And neither are you.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.167
Think about it.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.421
The only reason we even exist,

18:52.172 --> 18:56.343
you and I, and Desire and Despair,

18:57.553 --> 18:58.846
the whole family.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.516
We're here to serve them.

19:04.268 --> 19:10.649
It isn't about quests
or finding purpose outside our function.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.654
Our purpose is our function.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.158
We're here for them.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.786
Since I figured that out,

19:23.412 --> 19:29.501
I realized I need them
as much as they need me.

19:34.965 --> 19:39.845
I've seen so many cool things

19:39.928 --> 19:43.015
and people and worlds.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.475
I've learned so much.

19:48.395 --> 19:51.690
Lots of people don't have
a job they love doing, do they?

19:53.066 --> 19:56.486
So, I think I'm really very lucky.

19:58.488 --> 20:01.033
Listen, I've got to head back soon.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.957
You've taught me
something I had forgotten.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.627
I thank you, my sister.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.006
Aw.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.885
That's what family's about,
little brother.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.345
To me, man! Over here!

20:23.805 --> 20:26.725
-One last appointment, then I have to go.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.894
-I, too, am late for an appointment.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.313
Tell him I said hello.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.107
Franklin!

20:34.191 --> 20:35.108
I have to go.

20:38.987 --> 20:39.947
Hey.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.073
Did you see that?

20:41.782 --> 20:43.492
That car came this close to hitting me.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.118
This close, huh?

20:45.202 --> 20:46.036
Yeah.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.289
Come with me, Franklin.
I need to show you something.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.333
Okay.

20:51.833 --> 20:52.793
See ya, Dream.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.255
Don't be a stranger, okay?

21:24.032 --> 21:26.201
-Oi.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.442
Come on, then.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.196
What are you waiting for?

22:04.239 --> 22:05.198
Very well.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.577
But I do not see
what purpose this will serve.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.329
At least I get out and meet them.

22:12.122 --> 22:16.960
I just think maybe it would be good
for you to see them on their terms,

22:17.044 --> 22:18.128
instead of yours.

22:18.879 --> 22:22.466
Sir, penny ale for me and another
for my brother, if it please you.

22:22.549 --> 22:23.967
-Certainly, lady.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.136
Ta. Here you go.

22:35.854 --> 22:36.688
Ugh.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.607
This is terrible.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.985
His Majesty's third poll tax
in three years.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.987
What else could we have done, eh?

22:44.071 --> 22:46.156
When Ball and Tyler were killed,

22:46.239 --> 22:48.283
the spirit of the working man
died with them.

22:50.369 --> 22:54.373
We've got war, plague,
and two bloody popes fighting.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.833
The end of the world is soon, you mark me.

22:56.917 --> 22:57.918
Mmm-hmm.

22:58.001 --> 23:00.670
A delegation of Faerie
came to see me last night.

23:00.754 --> 23:03.340
They're talking about
abandoning this plane forever.

23:03.423 --> 23:06.134
Dream. Listen to the people.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.387
Drink your drink.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.639
We need
to return to law and order.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.058
We need to act against these bandits.

23:13.141 --> 23:14.684
Puttin' somethin' in the oven.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.728
So, he puts his hand up her dress.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.815
And she says, "Are you hunting
for rabbits again, Friar?"

23:23.902 --> 23:25.153
Piers Plowman.

23:25.237 --> 23:30.117
That's what people want, Geoffrey,
not filthy tales in rhyme about pilgrims.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.785
But Edmund, I enjoy rhyming.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.746
And I enjoy tavern tales
told of an evening.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.457
Look, I've seen death.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.794
I lost half my village to the Black Death.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.462
I fought under Buckingham in Burgundy.

23:42.546 --> 23:45.841
It's not like I don't know what death is.
Death is…

23:47.968 --> 23:49.094
stupid.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.221
You're a fool, Hob.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.473
Nobody has to die.

23:54.015 --> 23:57.269
The only reason people die
is… is 'cause everyone does it.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.563
You all just go along with it. But not me.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.441
I've made up my mind.

24:04.818 --> 24:05.986
I'm not going to die.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.448
Hobs, death comes for every man.

24:09.531 --> 24:10.740
You don't know that.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.784
I might get lucky.
There's always a first time.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.662
There's so much to do,
so many things to see.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.916
Women to swive. Ale to drink.
People to drink with.

24:22.711 --> 24:27.132
Why would any sensible creature
crave an eternity of this?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.051
You could find out.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.052
How?

24:31.136 --> 24:33.096
I could grant him his wish.

24:34.598 --> 24:39.311
Do that, and he will be begging for death
within a century, I assure you.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.063
This will prove very interesting.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.899
What will you do
with all that life?

24:43.982 --> 24:46.401
I'll find better friends than you,
I can tell you that.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.862
Are you gonna tell him, or should I?

24:50.405 --> 24:51.281
I shall.

24:52.407 --> 24:53.742
Very well, little brother.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.078
Very well.

25:04.544 --> 25:07.839
Did I hear you say
you have no intention of ever dying?

25:10.675 --> 25:12.093
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.054
Then you must tell me what it's like.

25:15.305 --> 25:18.767
Let us meet here again, Robert Gadling,

25:19.518 --> 25:23.313
in this tavern of the White Horse
in 100 years.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.736
A hundred years
and I'm Pope Urban.

25:31.655 --> 25:32.781
Don't mind them.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.452
A hundred years' time, on this day?

25:40.413 --> 25:43.792
I will see you
in the year of our Lord 1489, then.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.014
Who was that, then, Hobsie?

25:58.098 --> 25:59.182
Haven't a clue.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.852
But tell you what,
I'll ask him in 100 years' time.

26:16.950 --> 26:20.912
How did you know…
that I'd still be here?

26:23.623 --> 26:24.666
Who are you?

26:26.543 --> 26:28.920
A wizard? A… a saint?

26:33.133 --> 26:34.009
A demon?

26:36.386 --> 26:38.179
Have I made a bargain with the devil?

26:38.263 --> 26:39.264
No.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.892
Then why aren't I dead long since?

26:43.852 --> 26:45.562
Is this some kind of game?

26:46.146 --> 26:47.063
No game.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.190
But why?

26:53.111 --> 26:54.112
Who are you?

26:55.822 --> 26:57.282
Why are you here?

26:59.159 --> 27:01.119
I'm here because I'm interested.

27:02.495 --> 27:03.330
In me?

27:03.913 --> 27:05.290
In your experience.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.419
-What do I have to do?
-Nothing.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.463
You live your life as you choose.

27:11.546 --> 27:14.674
Then on this day,
every 100 years, we will meet.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.261
Because you wanna know what it's like.

27:23.725 --> 27:27.103
All right. I'll tell you what it's like.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.235
It's fucking brilliant.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.531
It's all changing.

27:38.615 --> 27:39.741
In what way?

27:39.824 --> 27:40.659
Um…

27:41.326 --> 27:42.619
Chimneys.

27:42.702 --> 27:45.997
Not having your eyes watering
all the time from the smoke.

27:46.706 --> 27:50.168
And now we have
these little cloth pieces for your nose.

27:50.251 --> 27:52.212
In the old days, we just used our sleeves.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.173
Oh. And playing cards.

27:55.715 --> 27:58.551
What will you people think of next?

27:59.344 --> 28:01.554
With any luck,
something to get rid of fleas.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.557
But what have you been doing
for the last hundred years?

28:04.641 --> 28:05.517
Um…

28:07.102 --> 28:09.688
Same as before. Soldiering, mainly.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.273
A little banditry here and there
if I couldn't find a war.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.527
Uh, but now, I've started in a new trade.

28:16.653 --> 28:17.737
It's called printing.

28:18.321 --> 28:19.989
Don't need to be a guild member, not yet.

28:20.073 --> 28:23.535
Uh, never be a real demand for it,
and it's hard work,

28:24.828 --> 28:27.914
but it beats the hell out of
rotting to maggots in the ground, eh?

28:30.625 --> 28:33.086
So you still want to live?

28:33.712 --> 28:34.546
Oh, yes.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.509
A hundred years, then?

28:40.468 --> 28:41.302
Oh, yes.

28:44.431 --> 28:45.932
You never told me who you are.

28:55.692 --> 29:02.240
Well, Kit, your theme as I saw it is this:
that for one's art and for one's dreams,

29:02.907 --> 29:05.910
one may consort and bargain
with the darkest powers.

29:05.994 --> 29:06.953
'Tis so.

29:07.036 --> 29:07.954
My friend!

29:10.039 --> 29:10.874
Sit down.

29:11.791 --> 29:15.003
Got in a couple of bottles
of good wine for us.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.671
Already made a start on 'em.

29:16.755 --> 29:17.672
Hello, Hob.

29:18.673 --> 29:19.507
"Hob"?

29:19.591 --> 29:22.469
Faith, that takes me back some few years.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.889
It's Sir Robert Gadlen now, old stranger.

29:25.972 --> 29:27.807
You've had good fortune, I take it.

29:27.891 --> 29:31.060
The gods have smiled on me
as they smile on all England

29:31.144 --> 29:33.313
where no man is slave or bondsman.

29:33.855 --> 29:34.773
Venison pasty?

29:36.107 --> 29:37.859
No? They're good.

29:39.569 --> 29:40.403
Mmm.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.155
Let's see.

29:42.238 --> 29:44.741
Last we spoke,
I was working with Billy Caxton.

29:44.824 --> 29:48.203
Made some gold from that.
Put it to work in Henry Tudor's shipyards.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.162
I made a small pile.

29:49.245 --> 29:52.248
Then I went north for a year or so,
came back as my son.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.374
Done that twice now.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.376
Girl, more wine.

29:56.044 --> 29:59.047
When fat Henry had gone
for the monasteries, I bought my estates,

29:59.130 --> 30:02.425
and a healthy gift of gold
to the Crown saw to…

30:03.635 --> 30:04.803
a knighthood.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.057
That's not all. Here.

30:12.894 --> 30:16.105
My fair Eleanor and little Robyn.

30:17.357 --> 30:21.653
My first son born in over 200 years
on this Earth, that I know of.

30:23.863 --> 30:24.823
It's funny.

30:25.907 --> 30:30.870
This is what I always dreamed
Heaven would be like, way back.

30:32.330 --> 30:36.501
It's safe to walk the streets.
Enough food. Good wine.

30:36.584 --> 30:39.087
Life is so rich.

30:40.129 --> 30:43.383
God's wounds!
If only I could write like you.

30:43.466 --> 30:49.097
In… in Faustus, when you wrote,
"To God? He loves thee not."

30:49.180 --> 30:50.348
Will, sit down.

30:50.431 --> 30:54.060
"The God thou servest
is thine own appetite,

30:54.143 --> 30:57.856
wherein is fixed the love of Beelzebub."

30:57.939 --> 31:00.817
"To him, I'll build an altar in the church

31:00.900 --> 31:04.612
and offer up lukewarm blood
of new-born babes."

31:04.696 --> 31:05.697
Hear, hear!

31:10.535 --> 31:12.662
I would give anything
to have your gifts.

31:12.745 --> 31:16.583
To give men dreams
that would live on long after I'm dead.

31:16.666 --> 31:20.920
I would bargain
like your Faustus for that boon.

31:21.963 --> 31:23.047
Who is he?

31:23.131 --> 31:26.968
His name's Will Shaxberd.
Acts a bit. Wrote a play.

31:27.051 --> 31:27.886
Is he good?

31:28.678 --> 31:29.762
No, he's crap.

31:30.305 --> 31:33.057
Now, that chap next to him,
with the broken leg,

31:33.141 --> 31:35.018
he is a good playwright.

31:37.312 --> 31:40.857
Anyway, I've saved the best bit for last.

31:41.441 --> 31:44.652
The queen herself slept
at my house this summer.

31:45.653 --> 31:47.280
That was expensive.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.670
Are you Will Shaxberd?

32:03.338 --> 32:06.466
Uh, aye, sir. Have we met?

32:07.884 --> 32:11.220
We have. But men forget in waking hours.

32:11.804 --> 32:13.181
I heard you talk, Will.

32:14.098 --> 32:15.600
Would you write great plays?

32:16.726 --> 32:19.729
Create new dreams
to spur the minds of men?

32:21.314 --> 32:22.482
Is that your will?

32:29.364 --> 32:30.490
It is.

32:30.573 --> 32:31.866
Then let us talk.

32:39.874 --> 32:42.293
Sir, do you still want the lamb, sir?

32:48.967 --> 32:51.427
Aye. Bring on the lamb.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.596
Everything to live for.

32:55.014 --> 32:56.516
And nowhere to go but up.

33:00.019 --> 33:02.939
Do not be so free
in assigning plagues, fires, floods

33:03.022 --> 33:05.775
to the judgment of the Lord for our sins.

33:06.859 --> 33:09.988
They make more from the dole
than they would from an honest day's work.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.698
I don't recommend that at all.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.200
You sure I can't help you, sir?

33:14.951 --> 33:16.327
No, thank you. I'm waiting for…

33:16.411 --> 33:19.414
Don't touch me!
Fucking dungwit. Get out of my way!

33:19.497 --> 33:22.166
Get back to the stews
with the rest of the filth.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.670
Let him be. He is my guest.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.803
I knew you'd be here.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.894
Do you know how hungry a man can get?

33:43.855 --> 33:46.065
If he doesn't die but he doesn't eat?

33:51.946 --> 33:53.114
I lost it all.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.743
My land. My gold.

33:59.078 --> 34:00.079
My Eleanor.

34:02.790 --> 34:04.417
She died in childbirth.

34:05.543 --> 34:06.919
The baby too.

34:07.879 --> 34:12.508
My boy, Robyn,
died in a tavern brawl when he was 20.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.510
I didn't go out much
after that.

34:17.346 --> 34:19.140
They tried to drown me as a witch.

34:19.682 --> 34:22.185
I'd lived there 40 years, overconfident.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.604
I got out with my skin a little more.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.315
And then it got worse.

34:28.816 --> 34:32.320
And worse and… worse.

34:36.282 --> 34:42.288
I've hated every second
of the last 80 years, every bloody second.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.206
You know that?

34:45.500 --> 34:47.210
So do you still wish to live?

34:53.591 --> 34:55.051
Are you crazy?

34:56.803 --> 35:00.348
Death is a mug's game.
I got so much to live for.

35:06.562 --> 35:09.148
Now can we order?
'Cause I'm about to eat the fucking table.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.966
I heard something funny
the other week.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.676
Bloke said to me, he said,

35:36.759 --> 35:39.387
"If only the French nobles had
played cricket with their men

35:39.470 --> 35:42.140
the way we do,
they'd never have had this trouble."

35:44.392 --> 35:46.727
You know, first the colonies, now France.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.398
You ask me, this country
will be next for a revolution.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.693
I've been salting money away
all over the world.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.737
First sign of trouble,
I'll be out of here like that.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.533
In the meantime…

36:03.286 --> 36:04.745
I'm in the shipping business.

36:06.455 --> 36:10.793
There's a new system where
they take English cotton goods to Africa,

36:11.711 --> 36:14.213
get a cargo of negroes,
pack 'em in like sardines.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.841
Same ship takes them across the Atlantic.

36:16.924 --> 36:19.969
Then comes back here
with raw cotton, tobacco and sugar.

36:23.055 --> 36:23.973
What?

36:25.224 --> 36:27.768
It's a poor thing
for one man to enslave another.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.396
It's just how it's done.

36:30.479 --> 36:33.900
I suggest you find yourself a different
line of business, Robert Gadling.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.611
You're giving me advice?

36:37.945 --> 36:39.822
After 400 years?

36:39.906 --> 36:41.991
What happened to
"live your life as you choose"?

36:42.074 --> 36:44.952
The choice is yours.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.830
But would you take
that choice away from others?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.506
I will consider your advice.

37:03.346 --> 37:06.015
I saw a production of King Lear yesterday.

37:06.098 --> 37:09.477
Mrs. Siddons as Goneril.
The idiots had given it a happy ending.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.604
That will not last.

37:11.687 --> 37:14.857
The great stories will always
return to their original forms.

37:17.860 --> 37:21.155
That lad, Will Shakespeare.

37:22.573 --> 37:25.326
He turned out to be
a half-decent playwright after all.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.331
You made some kind of deal with him,
didn't you?

37:30.414 --> 37:31.249
Perhaps.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.459
What kind of deal? His soul?

37:33.542 --> 37:35.378
Nothing so crude.

37:37.797 --> 37:40.508
Four hundred years now,
I've been meeting you here

37:40.591 --> 37:43.886
and there is so much I still don't know.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.972
Who are you? Truly?

37:46.555 --> 37:47.556
What's your name?

37:51.143 --> 37:55.106
I might ask both of you
that same question, gentlemen.

37:55.189 --> 37:59.110
Please, please,
do not trouble yourselves to rise.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.820
These are Michael and Tobias.

38:01.362 --> 38:02.446
Smugglers by trade.

38:02.530 --> 38:06.492
Although, they're only too glad to augment
their earnings by slitting throats.

38:06.575 --> 38:08.661
If you move, they'll slit yours.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.956
They tell of a tale in these London parts,

38:12.498 --> 38:17.378
that the Devil and the Wandering Jew
meet once every century in a tavern.

38:18.462 --> 38:21.257
Two years past,
sewn into the shirt of a dead man,

38:21.340 --> 38:23.968
I found this.

38:25.386 --> 38:26.554
Is that meant to be me?

38:27.138 --> 38:29.682
Oh, I look terrible. You look worse.

38:29.765 --> 38:32.268
You return to this pub every 100 years,

38:32.893 --> 38:37.315
striking bargains with men,
sharing gifts, immortality,

38:38.733 --> 38:40.067
which you will now share with me.

38:43.112 --> 38:46.490
Well, have you nothing to say?

38:46.574 --> 38:48.159
I am no Devil.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.702
And I'm not Jewish.

38:50.286 --> 38:51.120
Fie.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.874
What manner of creatures are you then?

38:54.957 --> 38:56.208
Who wants to know?

38:56.292 --> 38:58.294
I'm Lady Johanna Constantine.

38:59.086 --> 39:01.630
You will both follow me, sirs.
My coach is without.

39:03.257 --> 39:05.509
I can see there is
so much you can tell me.

39:07.053 --> 39:08.220
So much I can learn.

39:10.097 --> 39:11.140
No.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.643
No, I think not.

39:22.568 --> 39:23.694
Get up.

39:35.998 --> 39:36.874
Wait.

39:50.596 --> 39:52.264
No.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.017
No, not you.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.020
I'm sorry.

39:59.271 --> 40:00.648
What did you do to her?

40:00.731 --> 40:03.067
She has old ghosts that I've shown to her.

40:11.450 --> 40:14.286
You need not have come to my defense.

40:15.579 --> 40:16.455
Clearly.

40:18.457 --> 40:21.710
Still, I didn't want to be
drinking alone here in 100 years' time.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.843
I don't suppose you care to
find another pub tonight?

40:28.926 --> 40:31.178
She may have told others
about our meeting.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.471
It will not be safe for you.

40:32.555 --> 40:33.973
I'm perfectly safe.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.892
I can't die, remember?

40:36.976 --> 40:41.021
Aye. But you can be hurt or captured.

40:41.772 --> 40:42.940
We must be cautious.

40:44.191 --> 40:45.067
Always.

40:48.737 --> 40:49.864
A hundred years, then?

40:50.823 --> 40:51.782
A hundred years.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.471
-Oh.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.264
You gave us a start, sir.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.310
For a second,
I thought you was Bloody Jack hisself.

41:19.977 --> 41:21.061
No.

41:21.145 --> 41:24.773
No, I know that, sir.
Just joshing ya.

41:25.357 --> 41:31.322
So, how'd you like
to buy a gal a dram of pale?

41:31.405 --> 41:33.741
And maybe a quick bum dance?

41:33.824 --> 41:36.410
Give us a hard ride with your cream stick.

41:38.537 --> 41:39.580
I think not.

41:39.663 --> 41:41.916
I bet you ain't got it in you,
you skinny chickaleary.

41:41.999 --> 41:42.833
Lou!

41:45.127 --> 41:46.337
Get yourself a drink.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.215
Maybe just the one.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.719
Sorry about Lushing Lou.

41:56.305 --> 41:59.433
Lushing Lou.
Is that what they call her?

41:59.517 --> 42:01.894
Well, in here,
they call her "the Hospital."

42:02.478 --> 42:03.479
Why?

42:03.562 --> 42:05.105
Because she's in 'em a great deal,

42:05.189 --> 42:07.942
and because she's
sent so many men into 'em.

42:08.984 --> 42:11.654
-No idea what her real name is.
-Louise Baldwin.

42:11.737 --> 42:13.656
Her father was in the British army.

42:14.448 --> 42:17.076
Her cousin raped,
impregnated and deserted her

42:17.159 --> 42:18.536
when she was just a child.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.709
How do you know all that?

42:28.295 --> 42:31.590
-Your cup is empty. You need more wine.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.218
You knew Lady Johanna.
You know Lushing Lou.

42:34.301 --> 42:35.761
You know everyone, don't you?

42:37.346 --> 42:38.681
I saw her again, you know.

42:41.016 --> 42:43.310
Who? Lady Johanna?

42:43.394 --> 42:47.731
She undertook a task for me
and succeeded admirably, I might add.

42:49.483 --> 42:52.361
That might be the only thing
I've learned after 500 years.

42:57.116 --> 42:59.868
People are almost always better
than you think they are.

43:01.912 --> 43:04.498
Not me, though. Still the same as ever.

43:05.541 --> 43:07.918
I think perhaps you've changed.

43:10.421 --> 43:15.342
Well, I may have
learnt a bit from my mistakes. But, uh…

43:17.261 --> 43:19.054
doesn't seem to stop me from making them.

43:22.391 --> 43:24.101
I think it's you that's changed.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.104
How so?

43:29.315 --> 43:34.069
I think I know why we still meet here,
century after century.

43:34.695 --> 43:38.032
It's not because you want to see
whether or not I'm ready to seek death.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.701
I don't think I'll ever seek death.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.870
By now, you know that about me.

43:43.579 --> 43:47.374
So, I think you're here
for something else.

43:49.501 --> 43:50.753
And what might that be?

43:53.547 --> 43:54.423
Friendship.

43:56.675 --> 43:58.260
I think you're lonely.

44:00.721 --> 44:01.930
You dare…

44:03.390 --> 44:05.017
-No, look, I'm not saying--
-You…

44:06.185 --> 44:10.522
dare suggest one such as I
might need your companionship.

44:14.860 --> 44:18.155
Yes. Yes, I do.

44:24.119 --> 44:26.914
Then I shall take my leave of you
and prove you wrong.

44:35.964 --> 44:39.218
I'll tell you what,
I'll be here in 100 years' time.

44:39.885 --> 44:42.471
If you're here then too,
it'll be because we're friends.

44:42.554 --> 44:45.307
No other reason, right?

44:48.894 --> 44:49.728
Fuck.

45:11.583 --> 45:13.544
Thatcher's bloody poll tax.

45:13.627 --> 45:14.962
There's going to be a revolution…

45:15.045 --> 45:18.090
Then shave, get dressed, get a job
when they can make more on the dole

45:18.173 --> 45:19.842
than they would for an honest day's work.

45:21.176 --> 45:22.177
…up her dress.

45:22.261 --> 45:25.639
And she says, "Are you hunting
for rabbits again, Vicar?"

45:25.723 --> 45:26.557
Uh, mind if I…

45:26.640 --> 45:29.309
-Uh, I'm actually waiting for someone.
-Oh.

45:59.173 --> 46:00.007
Whiskey, please.

46:00.090 --> 46:03.343
Uh, you'll have to be more specific.
We got a menu now.

46:03.427 --> 46:04.261
Oh.

46:05.596 --> 46:06.638
What's the oldest you got?

46:06.722 --> 46:10.976
Well, I've got a Glen Grant,
old enough to be your father.

46:11.059 --> 46:13.562
-I'm older than I look.

46:29.203 --> 46:30.287
You waiting for someone?

46:32.289 --> 46:34.792
I think I've been stood up.

46:39.755 --> 46:43.133
We had a fight. Last time we were here.

46:43.217 --> 46:44.176
Ah.

46:45.803 --> 46:46.845
It was my fault.

46:48.806 --> 46:53.435
Wish I could say I was drunk at the time,
but I was just an idiot.

46:54.228 --> 46:56.730
I've seen plenty of friends
get in fights in pubs.

46:56.814 --> 46:59.107
Even more of them
laugh about it together later.

47:01.318 --> 47:02.945
-Maybe in another 100 years.
-Ah.

47:03.445 --> 47:05.656
You'll have to have found
a new pub by then.

47:05.739 --> 47:09.493
This place has been sold
to make room for new flats.

47:10.494 --> 47:12.246
The borough council
are trying to stop them,

47:12.329 --> 47:14.289
but if you've got enough money
in this country,

47:14.373 --> 47:16.208
you can do whatever you bloody want.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.673
Pour you another one? While you wait?

47:26.176 --> 47:27.010
Please.

48:34.244 --> 48:35.078
You're late.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.749
It seems I owe you an apology.

48:39.666 --> 48:42.753
I've always heard it impolite
to keep one's friends waiting.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.651
Attend, sweet sibling.

49:06.443 --> 49:08.987
It is I, Desire.

49:10.739 --> 49:13.700
I stand in my gallery
and I hold your sigil.

49:17.120 --> 49:19.498
Our brother has found
a way out of his cage.

49:20.248 --> 49:21.917
Our plan has failed.

49:23.585 --> 49:27.339
But don't worry. I have a new one.
