BURNING THE HOUSE DOWN.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.137
{\an8}- EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND.
EXCUSE ME.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.430
{\an8}DEENA, DEENA.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.223
{\an8}- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
IF HE REALLY SAID SOMETHING.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.600
{\an8}- NO, LET IT GO,
'CAUSE THEY'RE GOOD TOGETHER.

24:36.683 --> 24:37.726
{\an8}JUST LET IT GO.

24:37.809 --> 24:38.727
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT MY SISTER
TO BE WITH SOMEONE

24:38.810 --> 24:40.520
{\an8}THAT'S TALKING SHIT
ABOUT HER.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.314
{\an8}- THAT SOMETHING HE TOLD ME
ON THE PHONE,

24:42.397 --> 24:44.107
{\an8}IT'S NOT A BAD THING.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.942
{\an8}IT WAS WHAT IT WAS.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.570
{\an8}BUT YOUR SISTER'S GOOD PEOPLE.

24:48.653 --> 24:49.905
{\an8}AND I UNDERSTAND THAT,

24:49.988 --> 24:51.448
{\an8}AND THAT'S WHY
I DIDN'T BLOW IT UP.

24:51.531 --> 24:54.409
{\an8}- ONE PART OF ME IS LIKE, HMM,
IS MIKE JUST BEING A JERK

24:54.492 --> 24:57.162
{\an8}AND TRYING TO COVER IT UP,
SO LIKE HE SAVES HIS ASS?

24:57.245 --> 24:59.748
{\an8}THE OTHER PART OF ME IS, LIKE,
THEY ARE CUTE TOGETHER,

24:59.831 --> 25:02.584
{\an8}AND I DON'T WANNA RUIN
SOMETHING GOOD FOR MY SISTER.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.753
{\an8}WHATEVER, LET'S JUST LET IT GO,
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HER--

25:04.836 --> 25:06.504
{\an8}- YEAH, LET IT GO 'CAUSE
THEY'RE GOOD TOGETHER.

25:06.588 --> 25:07.756
{\an8}- YEAH.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.299
{\an8}AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I WANT MY SISTER TO BE HAPPY.

25:09.382 --> 25:10.592
{\an8}SO I LET IT GO.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.427
{\an8}- DEENA MIGHT BE
MY SISTER-IN-LAW.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.971
{\an8}- THIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH MY OLDEST BROTHER

25:15.055 --> 25:19.559
{\an8}AND DEENA'S OLDEST SISTER IS
TURNING INTO SOMETHING SERIOUS.

25:19.643 --> 25:22.604
{\an8}THEY--I MAY EVEN SPEND HOLIDAYS
WITH DEENA.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.940
{\an8}IMAGINE THAT HOLIDAY
CONVERSATION.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.775
{\an8}- MAID OF HONOR.
BEST MAN.

25:26.858 --> 25:30.946
{\an8}- I'D BE A GOOD BROTHER-IN-LAW,
I PROMISE YOU.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.452
{\an8}- SO HUNG OVER.

25:37.535 --> 25:38.787
{\an8}- YO, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
RIGHT NOW?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.288
{\an8}- GTL MAYBE?
- ROLL OUT.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.915
{\an8}- OH, THIS POOL STINKS, BRO.

25:41.998 --> 25:43.500
{\an8}I'LL GIVE SOMEONE
100 BUCKS TO JUMP IN.

25:43.583 --> 25:46.962
{\an8}- I WOULDN'T JUMP
FOR 200.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.381
{\an8}- LOOK AT THIS THING
I GOT.

25:49.464 --> 25:50.465
{\an8}- [gasp]

25:50.548 --> 25:52.884
{\an8}- I'M ON A MISSION
TO GET THESE BOYS BACK.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.552
{\an8}SO I WENT OUT AND GOT
ALL THESE WATER BALLOONS

25:54.636 --> 25:57.138
{\an8}AND THIS AWESOME SLINGSHOT
WATER BALLOON THING.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.640
{\an8}AND I'M, LIKE,
THIS IS GONNA BE PERFECT.

25:58.723 --> 25:59.766
{\an8}- WE HAVE MAD BALLOONS.

25:59.849 --> 26:00.976
{\an8}THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE IN FOR.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.435
{\an8}- NO.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S BE DONE.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.854
{\an8}- I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH.
WE HAVE TO HIDE THEM SOMEWHERE.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.314
{\an8}- ON THE DECK.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.441
{\an8}- ALL OF OUR PRANKS HAVE NOT
WORKED AND HAVE BACKFIRED ON US.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.860
{\an8}SO TONIGHT,
WE ARE GETTING THEM.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.571
{\an8}- WE'RE GONNA GET 'EM.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.332
{\an8}- STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT TODAY'S THE LAST DAY.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.043
{\an8}- I KNOW, IT'S CRAZY.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.045
{\an8}- TONIGHT IS OUR LAST NIGHT
TOGETHER.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.422
{\an8}TOMORROW MORNING,
WE'RE LEAVING.

26:30.505 --> 26:33.717
{\an8}SO ME AND RON ARE COOKING FOR
ONE LAST FAMILY DINNER TOGETHER.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.511
{\an8}- IT'S QUIET IN HERE.
- YEAH.

26:36.594 --> 26:38.638
{\an8}- IT'S GONNA FEEL
SO WEIRD TO GO HOME.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.307
{\an8}- ARE YOU GONNA MISS ME?
- I'M GONNA MISS EVERYBODY.

26:40.390 --> 26:43.727
{\an8}- BUT I SAID ME.
- YEAH, YOU TOO.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.103
{\an8}- WHOA,

27:03.288 --> 27:05.540
{\an8}- YEAH, IT'S LIKE RONNIE'S CAR

27:05.623 --> 27:06.082
{\an8}- [laughing]

27:06.166 --> 27:07.709

{\an8}YOU KNOW, THE HOUSE IS BEING
FILLED WITH SMOKE

27:17.469 --> 27:18.553

27:18.636 --> 27:21.056
{\an8}AND LEGIT, WE MIGHT JUST
LEAVE THIS HOUSE

27:21.139 --> 27:22.432
{\an8}BURNING THE HOUSE DOWN.

27:22.515 --> 27:24.809
{\an8}- YOU'RE GONNA BURN
YOUR EYEBROWS OFF, GRR.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.728
{\an8}HOW MANY DETECTORS WE GOT?

27:28.813 --> 27:31.066

27:31.149 --> 27:32.525
{\an8}WHAT IF WE ALL GET
ELECTROCUTED?

27:32.609 --> 27:34.527
{\an8}- YO, I CAN'T BELIEVE

{\an8}IT IS ABOUT THAT TIME.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.075
{\an8}- CAN YOU PASS ME
THE CHICKEN?

27:40.158 --> 27:41.743
{\an8}- THIS IS THE THIRD TIME
LIVING IN THIS HOUSE.

27:41.826 --> 27:44.120
{\an8}- FIVE FREAKIN' TIMES

{\an8}I'M GONNA MISS
THE BOYS PICKING ON ME.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.611
{\an8}I'LL EVEN MISS MIKE BEING
A LITTLE LOONEY SOMETIMES.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.029
{\an8}OKAY.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.364
{\an8}THIS PLACE HAS DEFINITELY
BEEN A SOAP OPERA,

38:03.447 --> 38:07.034
{\an8}BUT I'M NOT GONNA LIE,
I'M ADDICTED TO SOAP OPERAS.

38:07.118 --> 38:11.330
{\an8}THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD TIME.

38:12.790 --> 38:16.210
{\an8}- WHO'S THAT?
- PAPA SNOOKS.

38:16.293 --> 38:19.588

{\an8}[laughing]
- WHAT UP, MAN?

38:23.968 --> 38:26.220
{\an8}- I THOUGHT IT WAS PAPA SNOOKS.
I OPENED THE DOOR--NOPE.

38:26.303 --> 38:27.388
{\an8}BIG JERRY.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.098
{\an8}IT WAS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE,
SEEING BIG JERRY.

38:29.181 --> 38:30.975
{\an8}- YEAH, BUDDY.
- COME ON!

38:31.058 --> 38:33.477
{\an8}- WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO WAS COMING,
IF IT WAS YOU OR PAPA SNOOKS.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.146
{\an8}- SORRY.
- SHE'S PISSED, MAN!

38:35.229 --> 38:37.189
{\an8}- WE GOT THE SAME HAIRCUT.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.899

I'M SORRY.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.151

38:41.944 --> 38:43.404
{\an8}- SEE YOU SOON.
- BYE-BYE.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.614
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING
TO FIT THIS ALL IN THERE.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.033
{\an8}- WE'RE LOADING THE SHIT OUT
OF THIS CADDY,

38:47.116 --> 38:49.035
{\an8}BUT STUFF IS NOT FITTING.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.536
{\an8}- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE?

38:50.619 --> 38:51.328
{\an8}- YO, WATCH THE LEATHER, BRO.

38:51.412 --> 38:52.538
{\an8}- WHERE IS THIS GOING TO FIT?

38:52.621 --> 38:54.415
{\an8}- YEAH, I'M RIDING WITH
THAT ON MY LAP, BRO.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.916
{\an8}- YEAH, BUDDY.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.627
{\an8}- LET'S ROLL.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.504
{\an8}- THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG,
PACKED RIDE TO RHODE ISLAND.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.049
{\an8}- YEAH, BUDDY.
SEE YA.

39:03.132 --> 39:06.594
{\an8}- [yawning] OH, GOD.

39:06.677 --> 39:08.471
{\an8}I'M THE LAST PERSON
IN THE HOUSE.

39:08.554 --> 39:11.515
{\an8}AND IT'S REALLY LONELY
WITHOUT EVERYBODY.

39:11.599 --> 39:14.101
{\an8}I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.480
{\an8}WHY NOT?
CHEERS, PARTY HOUSE!

39:17.563 --> 39:19.774
{\an8}SEE YOU NEXT SUMMER A FEW.

39:19.857 --> 39:23.277
{\an8}GOOD-BYE, SMUSH.
BYE, STDs.

39:23.360 --> 39:26.322
{\an8}TILL NEXT YEAR.
OH, THERE'S A PISS STAIN.

39:26.405 --> 39:27.782
{\an8}COVER THAT.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.034
{\an8}DUCK PHONE,
I'M GONNA MISS YOU A LOT,

39:30.117 --> 39:32.578
{\an8}BUT I PROMISE YOU THAT
I WILL BE BACK NEXT YEAR,

39:32.661 --> 39:35.873
{\an8}AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
PHONE SEX WITH BOYS ON IT.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.419
{\an8}DAD! DAD!
- [laughs]

39:40.503 --> 39:43.631
{\an8}- LEAVING THE SHORE HOUSE
IS ALWAYS BITTERSWEET.

39:43.714 --> 39:45.466
{\an8}LIKE, YOU'RE EXCITED TO GO HOME
AND SEE YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS,

39:45.549 --> 39:48.427
{\an8}BUT THEN AGAIN,
IT MEANS THE PARTY'S OVER.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.346
{\an8}I MEAN, WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITH MY LIFE NOW?

39:50.429 --> 39:54.475
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

39:54.558 --> 39:55.601
{\an8}- I DEFINITELY WOULD LOVE

39:55.684 --> 39:57.144
{\an8}TO BE IN THIS HOUSE
50 YEARS FROM NOW.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.146
{\an8}I MEAN, I CAN DO THIS FOREVER,
LIKE, EVERY SUMMER

39:59.230 --> 40:00.981
{\an8}UNTIL I'M, LIKE, 90 YEARS OLD.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.526
{\an8}I LOVE YOU, SHORE HOUSE!
