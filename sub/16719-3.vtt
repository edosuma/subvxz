00:18.628 --> 00:20.940
Hi. Who are you?

00:21.003 --> 00:24.273
I'm a friend of Kay's.
Who... who are you?

00:24.339 --> 00:26.141
I'm Allen Brockman.
It's so nice to meet you.

00:26.208 --> 00:28.053
I... You took me by
surprise' cause I didn't think

00:28.077 --> 00:29.254
they were having a guest today.

00:29.278 --> 00:30.579
Yeah, I dropped in unexpectedly.

00:30.645 --> 00:32.781
Well, that's nice. And you are...

00:32.848 --> 00:34.716
Oh, my God.

00:34.783 --> 00:37.552
Oh, my God, wait a minute, you're...

00:37.619 --> 00:38.854
I know you.

00:38.921 --> 00:40.755
I know you... You're from...

00:40.822 --> 00:42.157
Who are... You're that girl.

00:42.224 --> 00:45.160
You're the girl from the
papers, from the papers.

00:45.227 --> 00:47.596
I've seen you before, from the papers.

00:47.662 --> 00:48.998
They're chasing you.

00:49.064 --> 00:51.300
- You're wanted.
- Look, keep it down.

00:51.366 --> 00:53.102
Nobody's gonna get hurt, okay?

00:53.168 --> 00:56.906
Look, I got to say... Jesus,
you're even prettier in person.

00:56.972 --> 00:59.241
It's amazing. Your photographs,

00:59.308 --> 01:00.986
they don't even come
close to doing you justice.

01:01.010 --> 01:02.211
You're beautiful.

01:02.277 --> 01:05.214
Wow, God, it's Lenny Dale.

01:05.925 --> 01:07.594
You said she'd be out of here by now.

01:07.661 --> 01:08.862
Well, she's not,

01:08.928 --> 01:10.897
and the police have
traced her to New York,

01:10.964 --> 01:12.566
and she's hot as a pistol.

01:12.632 --> 01:14.467
She can't leave until
the coast is clear.

01:14.568 --> 01:16.369
Kay, we're gonna wind up in prison.

01:16.435 --> 01:19.072
You know, and I'm the
type that gets sodomized.

01:19.138 --> 01:22.041
I'm fair skinned and,
you know, rather shapely.

01:22.108 --> 01:24.578
Yes, you are, but
we're safe now, we are.

01:24.611 --> 01:26.580
If the cops come, I got a rap sheet.

01:26.613 --> 01:28.081
You got a what?

01:28.147 --> 01:29.849
Remember when we were in Beverly Hills?

01:29.916 --> 01:31.584
I was arrested for jay walking.

01:31.585 --> 01:34.588
They... they threw me up
against the car, they frisked me.

01:34.621 --> 01:36.656
I only got out on a plea deal.

01:36.723 --> 01:39.292
Listen, I can't turn her out.

01:39.358 --> 01:40.794
I just can't turn her out.

01:40.860 --> 01:43.597
Have you seen how much this woman eats?

01:43.630 --> 01:46.432
I mean, do all
revolutionaries eat so much?

01:46.499 --> 01:48.401
Did Lenin eat so much?

01:48.467 --> 01:50.604
She's been starving, starving.

01:50.637 --> 01:52.338
She... she ate... First of all...

01:52.405 --> 01:55.241
First of all, my Fig
Newtons, she finished.

01:55.308 --> 01:56.776
The chicken is gone.

01:56.843 --> 02:01.080
I mean, you know, what...
what's going on here?

02:01.147 --> 02:02.315
She never stops.

02:02.381 --> 02:05.619
Will you forget about the
chicken and the Fig Newtons?

02:05.685 --> 02:07.286
You'll live without the Fig Newtons.

02:07.353 --> 02:08.655
We've got bigger fish to fry.

02:08.722 --> 02:10.622
Yeah, she also ate all the fish.

02:10.624 --> 02:12.759
You know, I bought sturgeon.

02:12.826 --> 02:14.628
Don't you have any pity at all for her?

02:14.661 --> 02:16.362
I have no pity.

02:16.429 --> 02:20.667
Sturgeon is, you know how
much sturgeon costs a pound?

02:20.734 --> 02:22.435
Oh, you're still in the kitchen.

02:22.501 --> 02:23.903
Yup.

02:23.970 --> 02:25.138
I met Allen.

02:25.204 --> 02:26.472
Did you?

02:26.539 --> 02:28.107
I gave him marijuana.

02:28.174 --> 02:30.109
Oh, great, that's great.

02:30.176 --> 02:32.645
Can you believe that
he's never tried it?

02:32.646 --> 02:34.714
What a sheltered life.

02:34.781 --> 02:36.850
Drugs, what does he need drugs for?

02:36.916 --> 02:39.252
Not drugs, grass, and don't worry,

02:39.318 --> 02:40.419
he's in his room trying it.

02:40.486 --> 02:41.697
I told him not to smoke it here

02:41.721 --> 02:44.223
or you'd have a cerebral hemorrhage.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.992
Hey, um, uh...

02:46.059 --> 02:49.262
Are you gonna eat that
last piece of sturgeon?

02:49.328 --> 02:51.130
Why, do you want it?

02:51.197 --> 02:54.901
Yeah, I... I have a little
tradition here, Friday mornings.

02:54.968 --> 02:57.036
Sure. It's all yours.

02:57.103 --> 03:00.339
You plutocrats are lost
without your high end luxuries.

03:00.406 --> 03:02.809
Hey, don't give me the
plutocrats routine, okay?

03:02.876 --> 03:04.711
I came from a poor family in Brooklyn.

03:04.778 --> 03:06.145
My father was a baker.

03:06.212 --> 03:08.848
I used to... we had no
money at all, you know?

03:08.915 --> 03:11.751
I would... I would sneak
into his shop after hours

03:11.818 --> 03:14.687
and suck the jelly out
of the jelly donuts.

03:14.688 --> 03:15.554
That was my dessert.

03:15.689 --> 03:17.190
You sound like Nixon.

03:17.256 --> 03:19.692
Yeah, well, I... I'm the guy
that had to earn the money

03:19.693 --> 03:20.927
for the family.

03:20.994 --> 03:24.698
I originally I wanted
to be Chekhov or Salinger

03:24.731 --> 03:26.733
is who I really wanted to be, Salinger.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.803
But I had to support
everybody so I got a job

03:29.869 --> 03:31.771
on Madison Avenue writing commercials.

03:31.838 --> 03:34.373
Oh, yeah, so you could
sell people products

03:34.440 --> 03:37.376
that they don't really want
or need with false claims.

03:37.443 --> 03:38.712
No, never false.

03:38.778 --> 03:41.981
Never, never false claims, you know?

03:42.048 --> 03:45.985
Although I did have to use some
ingenuity to persuade people

03:46.052 --> 03:48.254
to buy a musical toilet seat.

03:48.321 --> 03:50.323
It's a disgraceful way to make money.

03:50.389 --> 03:53.860
Well, you know, it's not
robbing a bank like you do.

03:53.927 --> 03:56.963
You know, I... I... I
had a... a... a novel,

03:57.030 --> 03:59.298
my first novel was on
the best seller list.

03:59.365 --> 04:01.567
In what paper, the
poultry man's journal?

04:01.634 --> 04:03.069
Hey, don't give me that.

04:03.136 --> 04:05.338
I'm sure you've never
read it, of course.

04:05.404 --> 04:07.440
It was called "Let There Be Light".

04:07.506 --> 04:09.742
It was about a
proctologist who finds God

04:09.743 --> 04:12.045
in the strangest places.

04:12.111 --> 04:13.246
Hack claptrap.

04:13.312 --> 04:16.149
Yeah, well, I still get
plenty of royalties from it.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.385
Of course, so you can buy
all the stupid products

04:19.452 --> 04:21.821
that a capitalistic society has to offer

04:21.887 --> 04:23.656
its moron customers.

04:23.757 --> 04:26.826
Possessions, possessions, status,

04:26.893 --> 04:28.603
you know just anything
to create an illusion

04:28.627 --> 04:30.196
of happiness in life.

04:30.263 --> 04:31.865
What the hell are you talking about?

04:31.931 --> 04:33.599
You know, you rant
and you... you babble.

04:33.666 --> 04:36.335
What... what... what...
what are you discussing here?

04:36.402 --> 04:39.372
- Like that.
- What... This is my waffle iron.

04:39.438 --> 04:41.307
You're politically
against my waffle iron?

04:41.374 --> 04:42.842
- And this?
- That's a blender.

04:42.909 --> 04:44.443
Yes, I have appliances.

04:44.510 --> 04:46.279
And what the hell is this?

04:46.345 --> 04:48.214
It's a hot fudge machine.

04:49.648 --> 04:52.118
Do you understand that...
that people are starving?

04:52.185 --> 04:54.921
- For hot fudge?
- No, you boob.

04:54.988 --> 04:58.691
Families can't feed their
children the essentials of life.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.494
Here in America, do you
know the malnutrition rate?

05:01.560 --> 05:04.263
And while kids are starving,
you stand here and dick around

05:04.330 --> 05:07.801
- with waffles and hot fudge.
- Yeah, and you make bombs.

05:07.867 --> 05:09.803
And it's not that you're
stupid, which you are,

05:09.836 --> 05:10.937
it's just that you're like

05:11.004 --> 05:12.444
millions of other passive Americans.

05:12.505 --> 05:14.473
You're a mindless, cowardly follower.

05:14.540 --> 05:17.610
A stooge with herd mentality.

05:17.676 --> 05:18.812
Out, get out.

05:18.878 --> 05:19.979
I want you out.

05:20.046 --> 05:21.848
I want you out of my house.

05:21.915 --> 05:23.883
- I know.
- No, no.

05:23.950 --> 05:25.852
Nevertheless, I have to
stay here for a while.

05:25.919 --> 05:27.386
I'm... You have to stay?

05:27.453 --> 05:28.888
You have to stay?

05:28.955 --> 05:30.065
I'm the master of this house and...

05:30.089 --> 05:32.158
Oh, God, give it a rest.

05:32.225 --> 05:34.060
Kay makes the rules around here

05:34.127 --> 05:36.329
and she understands my problem.

05:36.395 --> 05:39.198
All right, I'm setting up your room.

05:39.265 --> 05:42.601
Now, what do you like to sleep
on, foam rubber or feathers?

05:42.668 --> 05:45.371
What are you nuts? Don't
set a room up for her.

05:45.438 --> 05:46.840
Have you no conscience?

05:46.873 --> 05:48.017
Didn't your parents ever teach you

05:48.041 --> 05:49.943
that social injustice is wrong?

05:50.009 --> 05:51.710
That everything that you believe

05:51.845 --> 05:54.080
is America the beautiful
is just a fantasy?

05:54.147 --> 05:56.282
That it's not the place that
it purports itself to be?

05:56.349 --> 05:59.418
But it can be, if
everything's just scrapped

05:59.485 --> 06:01.020
and we start over.

06:01.087 --> 06:03.122
My parents taught me how
to make ice cream sodas

06:03.189 --> 06:05.959
without soda water using Alka Seltzer.

06:06.025 --> 06:07.693
Look, I'm gonna leave the country soon.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.295
I just, I need a little bit of time.

06:09.362 --> 06:12.932
I... I can't be a law breaker, I can't.

06:12.999 --> 06:14.868
I'm sure you cheat on your income tax.

06:14.934 --> 06:16.069
I never cheat.

06:16.135 --> 06:18.304
I just don't declare everything.

06:18.371 --> 06:20.206
Wow, I feel so relaxed.

06:20.273 --> 06:22.876
Just good and loose and nice.

06:22.942 --> 06:25.544
And... Lenny, I have to thank you.

06:25.611 --> 06:29.482
I feel so good, like I'm
surfing in Acapulco Bay.

06:29.548 --> 06:30.950
Just mellow.

06:31.017 --> 06:33.152
Hey, you hear that, Kay? He's surfing.

06:33.219 --> 06:35.154
She... she... she gave him a cigarette.

06:35.221 --> 06:37.456
Mellow is for cheese.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.459
Listen, Allen, Lenny's
gonna be staying with us

06:40.526 --> 06:42.929
for a while but you're...
you're not to tell anybody

06:42.996 --> 06:44.397
'cause it's top secret.

06:44.463 --> 06:46.899
Okay, my lips are sealed, you know?

06:46.900 --> 06:49.035
This woman, she's a gift from God.

06:49.102 --> 06:50.503
Oh, you read Job too.

06:50.569 --> 06:52.338
I got to confess something though.

06:52.405 --> 06:54.483
I was a little awash in guilt
on meeting this creature.

06:54.507 --> 06:55.942
Guilt, why?

06:56.009 --> 06:57.776
Because I've always
had this crush on her

06:57.911 --> 07:01.147
and then you meet her and even
sexier in person, you know?

07:01.214 --> 07:03.549
Would you two guys want to be alone?

07:03.616 --> 07:05.184
I could open a bottle of wine.

07:05.251 --> 07:06.920
Look how well they get along.

07:06.986 --> 07:08.354
I would never have guessed it.

07:08.421 --> 07:11.924
I introduced him to his fiancée.

07:11.925 --> 07:13.359
What a beautiful revolutionary.

07:13.426 --> 07:15.194
It's just a mellow combination.

07:15.261 --> 07:17.163
Well, this corrupt system
needs to be changed.

07:17.230 --> 07:18.998
I mean, by any means necessary.

07:19.065 --> 07:20.342
Yeah, here, here. I agree with her.

07:20.366 --> 07:22.301
See, I see where she's coming from.

07:22.368 --> 07:24.938
The Constitutional Liberation
Army, the Black Panthers.

07:25.004 --> 07:27.240
- They want action.
- Not rhetoric.

07:27.306 --> 07:28.241
No, and they're willing to go to jail

07:28.307 --> 07:29.976
for what they believe in.

07:30.043 --> 07:31.553
So, am I not gonna
stay in that same room

07:31.577 --> 07:33.012
I was in last night?

07:33.079 --> 07:35.148
No, that's my office and
it's on the first floor

07:35.214 --> 07:36.950
which is not a good idea.

07:36.983 --> 07:38.517
I'm gonna put you on the second floor

07:38.584 --> 07:40.987
in the guest room as soon as
Sid clears out the cartons.

07:41.054 --> 07:42.355
No, no, no.

07:42.421 --> 07:45.591
This is not... I invoke
the Napoleonic code.

07:45.658 --> 07:46.993
You will not stay here.

07:47.060 --> 07:48.161
Sid, stop ranting.

07:48.227 --> 07:50.429
It's just treason, Kay.

07:50.496 --> 07:51.965
It's worse than treason.

07:51.998 --> 07:54.100
It's barratry, it's barratry.

07:54.167 --> 07:55.801
It's arson at high sea.

07:55.868 --> 07:58.304
I'll get your room ready. Come on, Sid.

07:58.371 --> 08:01.807
No, Kay, this is arson at high sea.

08:01.874 --> 08:03.742
Thanks for sticking up for me or...

08:03.809 --> 08:05.878
or are you just high?

08:05.979 --> 08:08.114
Yeah.

08:08.181 --> 08:09.782
But I feel... I feel good, you know?

08:09.848 --> 08:15.088
I feel good and I do believe
America needs radical change.

08:15.154 --> 08:17.390
And how do you think those
goals are gonna be achieved,

08:17.456 --> 08:21.060
by writing irate letters
to the New York Times?

08:21.127 --> 08:24.197
Well, there's such a thing
as passive resistance.

08:24.263 --> 08:26.999
You can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.767
I know, I get it. Life is a choice.

08:28.834 --> 08:31.870
Yeah, but real change comes
at the barrel of a gun.

08:32.005 --> 08:35.607
It also comes in the voting booth.

08:35.674 --> 08:37.643
What? I donate.

08:37.710 --> 08:41.280
Okay, you're thinking all
easy no risky stuff right?

08:41.347 --> 08:44.017
Yeah, talk talk talk while people die.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.251
Okay, fine.

08:45.318 --> 08:47.019
Talk is cheap, talk is cheap.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.254
So what do you do?

08:48.321 --> 08:49.722
Will you let me explain?

08:49.788 --> 08:51.566
Oh, God, why are you
getting defensive already?

08:51.590 --> 08:53.859
Do you manufacture arms or something?

08:53.926 --> 08:56.062
I come from a banking family.

08:56.129 --> 08:58.364
It's a long tradition I was born into.

08:58.431 --> 09:01.067
It doesn't bother you
that this... this country

09:01.134 --> 09:03.202
is run by corporate oligarchy?

09:03.269 --> 09:06.038
I'm not saying I agree with
everything my father says.

09:06.039 --> 09:08.641
That very few people control the wealth.

09:08.707 --> 09:10.043
Look, life isn't fair.

09:10.076 --> 09:12.611
Do they have any dessert?

09:12.678 --> 09:16.282
If Washington and Jefferson
just voted and donated

09:16.349 --> 09:18.184
you wouldn't even be here.

09:18.251 --> 09:20.453
I mean, don't you think
I'd like to do what you do?

09:20.519 --> 09:23.056
Something that would make a
difference in the real world?

09:23.089 --> 09:25.858
It's just I'm not sure the
only way to achieve that

09:25.924 --> 09:27.860
is with the barrel of a gun.

09:27.926 --> 09:31.897
Violence is the sire of
all the world's values.

09:31.964 --> 09:33.332
Do you know who wrote that?

09:33.399 --> 09:35.601
Robinson Jeffers, he's
one of my favorite poets.

09:35.668 --> 09:37.570
Next time you go down to the city,

09:37.636 --> 09:39.605
I'm gonna give you a
list of books to read.

09:39.672 --> 09:41.250
You can get some for Kay,
too. I know she likes to read.

09:41.274 --> 09:42.808
Yeah, that's a great idea.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.753
She has that book club, so...
I don't think they really

09:44.777 --> 09:47.346
do political stuff
though. It's mostly novels.

09:47.413 --> 09:50.883
Fiction is just fairy tales.

09:50.949 --> 09:51.984
Jeez.

09:52.085 --> 09:54.086
How did you get radicalized?

09:54.087 --> 09:57.390
Actually it was a guy that I
fell in love with at college.

09:57.456 --> 10:00.893
There were actually two guys I
fell in love with at Berkeley.

10:01.094 --> 10:02.928
A Jew and a Black.

10:02.995 --> 10:04.930
That's a lethal combination.

10:04.997 --> 10:06.432
Abe Cohen.

10:06.499 --> 10:09.102
He was a radical Marxist.

10:09.168 --> 10:10.703
And then there was Elton Crawford.

10:10.769 --> 10:13.272
He used to write the
most beautiful sonnets

10:13.339 --> 10:14.807
about blowing up the White House

10:14.873 --> 10:16.675
and poisoning the reservoirs.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.320
I used to sleep with
the Black in an effort

10:18.344 --> 10:21.013
to kind of absorb some
of his political rage

10:21.080 --> 10:23.516
and then the Jew to help
me get some of that anxiety

10:23.582 --> 10:25.651
and guilt over being middle class.

10:25.718 --> 10:28.121
Sexual intercourse can
be very enlightening.

10:28.187 --> 10:29.467
Yeah, I had a shrink at the time

10:29.522 --> 10:31.390
who was a strict Freudian.

10:31.457 --> 10:33.592
He never talked, never moved.

10:33.659 --> 10:37.230
You know, I came in one
day and laid on the couch.

10:37.296 --> 10:38.664
I guess three minutes into it,

10:38.731 --> 10:40.333
he had a quiet heart attack and died.

10:40.399 --> 10:43.202
I had no idea, I kept
talking for 55 minutes.

10:43.269 --> 10:44.670
I really think it's probably

10:44.737 --> 10:47.005
my most productive session, actually.

10:47.072 --> 10:48.341
You know, I had a shrink too.

10:48.407 --> 10:51.076
- Why?
- I have impulsivity problems.

10:51.144 --> 10:52.354
The shrink thought it was from having

10:52.378 --> 10:54.180
two strict hovering parents.

10:54.247 --> 10:56.449
But, you know, I love them though.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.218
Why am I telling you this? I just...

10:59.285 --> 11:01.854
Look, I just mean that I
believe in shrinks, that's all.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.923
Incidentally, do you have
any more of that grass?

11:04.990 --> 11:08.161
I'm upset, Kay. I've got
to call into my lawyer.

11:08.194 --> 11:09.828
Oh, you don't you dare tell your lawyer.

11:09.895 --> 11:11.397
Please don't leak this.

11:11.464 --> 11:13.266
She's here for a few
weeks and then she'll go

11:13.332 --> 11:15.968
unless you just spoil
everything with your nervousness.

11:16.034 --> 11:17.312
Yeah, but she's bound to be caught

11:17.336 --> 11:18.904
and then she's gonna implicate us.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.173
Oh, she's gonna implicate us.

11:20.239 --> 11:21.874
You know that? She'll never talk.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.543
She'll talk. They'll get,
they know how to get it out.

11:24.610 --> 11:26.445
They'll beat it out of
her with nightsticks.

11:26.512 --> 11:28.647
They don't use... It's in
the movies they do that.

11:28.714 --> 11:31.083
In real life, they use rubber hoses.

11:31.184 --> 11:32.985
Jesus, they won't have to use anything.

11:33.051 --> 11:34.953
You know, she talks in her sleep.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.489
They'll bug her cell and she'll say,

11:36.555 --> 11:39.925
"Thank you, Kay and Sidney Muntzinger,

11:39.992 --> 11:42.195
"for helping me betray my nation."

11:45.063 --> 11:46.865
I'm so nervous.

11:46.932 --> 11:48.734
Hello?

11:48.801 --> 11:51.704
No, no, not necessary
to send anybody over.

11:51.770 --> 11:54.039
I hit the wrong button on the alarm.

11:54.106 --> 11:55.874
We don't need a repairman.

11:55.941 --> 11:57.476
No, no. No, no, no.

11:57.543 --> 11:59.245
But... but thank you for the concern.

11:59.312 --> 12:00.713
No, everything's fine.

12:00.779 --> 12:02.615
Yes, God bless, God bless you.

12:02.681 --> 12:03.758
- Hang up.
- God bless your children.

12:03.782 --> 12:06.319
You're crazy.

12:06.385 --> 12:07.953
What are you doing?

12:08.020 --> 12:10.889
For God sakes, what are you
fussing so much over the room?

12:10.956 --> 12:12.525
It's not a hotel.

12:12.591 --> 12:14.111
I'm surprised you don't put, you know,

12:14.227 --> 12:16.262
two little mints down on her bed.

12:16.329 --> 12:17.530
Will you go to work?

12:17.596 --> 12:19.632
Just go... just go pitch
your... your TV show.

12:19.698 --> 12:20.698
Come on.

12:34.079 --> 12:38.484
Basically it's... it's a
kooky family and, you know,

12:38.551 --> 12:41.920
it's a father, mother, and
a son and two daughters.

12:41.987 --> 12:44.065
And, you know, one of the
daughters is very beautiful.

12:44.089 --> 12:47.293
The other one is, you know,
let's say on the plump side.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.570
You know, 'cause that way we can get in

12:48.594 --> 12:50.363
a certain amount of fat jokes.

12:50.429 --> 12:54.032
Not... not cruel jokes, but
you know there's a rich vein

12:54.099 --> 12:56.669
of humor to be mined with...
with the overweight jokes

12:56.735 --> 13:00.272
and, uh, and I'll give you
what the basic idea here is.

13:00.273 --> 13:05.678
It's that they don't really
live in a beautiful house.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.281
They live in caves.
They're Neanderthals.

13:08.314 --> 13:12.284
We go back a million years
and there's fires in the cave

13:12.285 --> 13:13.886
and they have loincloths and clubs

13:13.952 --> 13:18.324
and they have a pet
tyrannosaurus, and...

13:18.391 --> 13:19.958
Don't we have a meeting at noon?

13:20.025 --> 13:23.396
Well, let me tell you the
plot. Let me tell you...

13:23.462 --> 13:27.333
The plot is that the
son is kind of sensitive

13:27.400 --> 13:29.768
and he wants to draw.

13:29.835 --> 13:33.138
He draws, he draws bisons on
the wall and other, you know,

13:33.205 --> 13:34.707
but basically bisons.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.310
I think mostly that's
what they draw on the wall

13:37.343 --> 13:41.347
and he's in love with
a girl from another cave

13:41.414 --> 13:43.982
and she's evolved higher.

13:44.049 --> 13:47.786
She's not a Neanderthal,
she's... now I don't know

13:47.853 --> 13:49.664
what the hell they were,
Cro-Magnums or something.

13:49.688 --> 13:53.326
Cro-Magnons, I can never
follow it, but she's higher.

13:53.392 --> 13:55.728
So you can see the comic possibilities.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.997
I mean, Mel here is great at jokes,

13:59.064 --> 14:00.433
absolutely fabulous at jokes,

14:00.499 --> 14:02.968
and I'm very good at texture

14:03.035 --> 14:06.405
and the comic possibilities are myriad.

14:14.212 --> 14:15.781
Thank you.

14:15.848 --> 14:18.250
Oh, and you know what, I'll
have a... a cup of coffee.

14:18.351 --> 14:19.585
Thanks.

14:19.652 --> 14:21.887
How, how, how do you think it went?

14:21.954 --> 14:23.121
I think you told it well.

14:23.188 --> 14:24.628
But you know I sensed, I don't know,

14:24.690 --> 14:26.701
maybe they were looking for
something more contemporary.

14:26.725 --> 14:27.760
I don't know.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.428
How's everything at home by the way?

14:29.495 --> 14:30.539
What do you mean how's
everything at home?

14:30.563 --> 14:32.531
It's fine, absolutely fine.

14:32.598 --> 14:35.568
Why would you ask that?

14:35.634 --> 14:37.370
Okay, what you get so jumpy about?

14:37.403 --> 14:38.637
I'm not jumpy.

14:38.704 --> 14:40.238
I'm, you know, I'm not jumpy.

14:40.373 --> 14:41.683
I just asked how everything was at home

14:41.707 --> 14:43.241
'cause I know you have a house guest.

14:43.376 --> 14:45.378
She'll be out quickly.

14:45.444 --> 14:48.180
Oh, she? Oh, I thought it was a guy.

14:48.246 --> 14:49.648
It is a guy.

14:49.715 --> 14:51.249
It's, it's, what do... It's a guy.

14:51.384 --> 14:53.452
Okay, all right, well, you said "she."

14:53.519 --> 14:54.987
Okay, but it's a guy.

14:55.053 --> 14:57.456
His name is Allen.
It's, it's a, you know...

14:57.523 --> 14:59.391
Hey, you want to meet him?

14:59.392 --> 15:01.727
I can let you meet him if you want.

15:01.794 --> 15:03.529
Okay, he's a male, I got it.

15:03.596 --> 15:05.564
Can we change the subject?

15:05.631 --> 15:07.299
Look, I know you're
a little nervous today

15:07.400 --> 15:08.901
but you know, you should just relax.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.927
You know, I mean, look,
you made the presentation.

15:10.969 --> 15:13.081
There's nothing you can do.
It's up to the network guys.

15:13.105 --> 15:16.675
Please, everything is
completely normal at home.

15:16.742 --> 15:20.212
Okay, you just said you
want to change the subject.

15:20.278 --> 15:22.280
So bring up a topic.

15:22.415 --> 15:24.693
Okay, how 'bout those guys
who shot their way out of jail?

15:24.717 --> 15:26.661
Huh, you hear about that?
That revolutionary group?

15:26.685 --> 15:28.286
You following that manhunt?

15:28.421 --> 15:29.898
One of them's a girl.

15:29.922 --> 15:31.232
You see that? Good-looking chick,

15:31.256 --> 15:33.726
but apparently hard as nails.

15:33.792 --> 15:36.862
I hear she comes from
a decent home, you know?

15:36.929 --> 15:38.449
But, uh, yeah, that's the papers said.

15:38.497 --> 15:40.032
But you know what it is?

15:40.098 --> 15:42.768
These people, they look around
and they don't like the war.

15:42.835 --> 15:44.269
You know, the way the poor people,

15:44.336 --> 15:45.614
the negroes, are getting shafted

15:45.638 --> 15:46.748
and all of a sudden they decide

15:46.772 --> 15:48.016
they want to change the government.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.908
They want, you know,
like a whole revolution.

15:49.975 --> 15:54.179
Yes, but what... they... have
to work within the system.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.814
That's the way to do it.

15:55.881 --> 15:59.317
'Cause otherwise, I was
telling Lenny, it's chaos.

15:59.452 --> 16:01.487
Who's Lenny?

16:01.554 --> 16:05.090
Lenny, Lenny is, you, Lenny
is Lenny Lipshitz, my tailor.

16:05.157 --> 16:08.260
We discuss politics and...
and I'm explaining to him

16:08.326 --> 16:11.029
that the founding fathers
have given us a way

16:11.096 --> 16:12.330
to amend the constitution.

16:12.465 --> 16:14.032
You're right, can't have chaos.

16:14.099 --> 16:15.910
You know, if I ever ran
into somebody like that,

16:15.934 --> 16:18.537
I would sit her down and
give her a good talking to.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.472
I hear there's a reward
out for the woman.

16:20.473 --> 16:22.216
There's like some big
reward 'cause, you know,

16:22.240 --> 16:23.576
she become a symbol now.

16:23.642 --> 16:24.943
She's definitely a symbol.

16:25.010 --> 16:27.813
There's no question that she's a symbol.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.817
What, what... what is she a symbol of?

16:31.884 --> 16:34.219
Come on, she's white,
she's middle class, female,

16:34.286 --> 16:36.321
she's militant, uncompromising,

16:36.388 --> 16:39.024
known to be violent.

16:39.091 --> 16:40.959
She's a radical.

16:41.026 --> 16:45.397
Exactly. I got a thing
about kids like her.

16:45.498 --> 16:47.800
Why did they call it clam chowder?

16:47.866 --> 16:50.669
There's, I don't see a single
clam in your clam chowder.

16:50.736 --> 16:53.038
This is false advertising.

16:53.105 --> 16:56.909
You know, my theory is
she's just a punk, you know?

16:56.975 --> 16:58.286
People like that, she grows up with

16:58.310 --> 16:59.750
all this personal baggage, you know?

16:59.812 --> 17:03.315
You know, family gripes, hurt
by one parent or the other,

17:03.381 --> 17:04.950
trouble with siblings, boyfriends,

17:05.017 --> 17:07.653
all this psychological
garbage, you know?

17:07.720 --> 17:09.521
This anger builds up inside
and she's got to give it

17:09.521 --> 17:11.824
some kind of stupid noble justification.

17:11.890 --> 17:14.827
End the war, help the
poor, Black Panthers.

17:14.893 --> 17:16.895
Why don't we just rage
against the government?

17:16.962 --> 17:18.931
You know, it's a rationale
so she can express

17:18.997 --> 17:21.534
her own personal rage and
give it some kind of patina

17:21.599 --> 17:23.836
of some kind of political do gooding.

17:23.902 --> 17:26.638
But there are no clams
in your clam chowder.

17:26.704 --> 17:29.274
Does that bother you?

17:29.341 --> 17:30.142
Did you listen to what I'm saying?

17:30.208 --> 17:32.010
Do you hear? Hello?

17:32.077 --> 17:34.547
Yes, I understand what you're saying.

17:34.580 --> 17:37.616
You're saying that
she's... makes an omelet

17:37.683 --> 17:41.253
and she's willing to
break eggs to do it.

17:41.319 --> 17:42.755
What does that have to do anything?

17:42.821 --> 17:44.990
It's a saying.

17:45.057 --> 17:47.359
You can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs,

17:47.425 --> 17:49.695
or legs, legs, legs or eggs.

17:49.762 --> 17:52.665
Eggs, not legs, eggs. Eggs, okay, eggs.

17:52.731 --> 17:55.601
'Cause I broke a leg making an omelet.

17:55.668 --> 17:57.111
I was making a mushroom
omelet in the kitchen,

17:57.135 --> 18:00.172
I slipped on some
chicken fat on the floor,

18:00.238 --> 18:01.940
I broke a leg.

18:02.007 --> 18:03.618
I mean, do you think
it's right for these kids

18:03.642 --> 18:05.043
to burn the American flag?

18:05.110 --> 18:07.012
No, I think that's terrible

18:07.079 --> 18:10.749
and, and what's really
terrible is shooting a cop.

18:10.816 --> 18:12.751
I, I don't know why
I'm speaking so loud.

18:12.818 --> 18:15.588
You're right in front of me.

18:15.654 --> 18:18.456
Well, it's infuriating. These
kids get drafted and right away,

18:18.591 --> 18:20.192
they got to take off to Canada.

18:20.258 --> 18:23.762
Hey, do you know how
cold it is in Canada?

18:23.829 --> 18:25.964
Do you know how
freezing it is in Canada?

18:26.031 --> 18:27.465
When you got drafted, come on,

18:27.600 --> 18:28.760
did you try to get out of it?

18:28.801 --> 18:30.703
I never would go near Canada.

18:30.769 --> 18:32.871
I've never, never been to Canada.

18:32.938 --> 18:34.458
Yeah, well, when I got drafted, I went

18:34.506 --> 18:35.841
and I did my time and I served.

18:35.908 --> 18:38.076
I did what I was supposed
to do for this country.

18:38.143 --> 18:40.112
I went to the draft
board and I threw up.

18:40.178 --> 18:41.279
Really?

18:41.346 --> 18:43.248
That was the sight of
all those naked men.

18:43.315 --> 18:44.783
I couldn't stop vomiting.

18:44.850 --> 18:47.319
You know, well, naked,
you know, naked men do it.

18:47.385 --> 18:50.188
Not just the men. I
mean if I go to Chinatown

18:50.255 --> 18:52.190
and they hang those ducks in the window,

18:52.257 --> 18:54.627
you know, they're naked, and I get sick.

18:54.693 --> 18:56.461
Anything like that.

18:56.528 --> 18:58.964
I mean my wife, I can tolerate.

18:59.031 --> 19:01.151
There's no doubt they're
gonna catch this crazy broad.

19:01.199 --> 19:03.135
They've got every cop in
America looking for her.

19:03.201 --> 19:05.237
You know, they got ways
of tracking these people.

19:05.303 --> 19:07.806
The paper said they
think she might even be

19:07.873 --> 19:09.407
right here in New York.

19:09.474 --> 19:10.308
Really?

19:10.375 --> 19:11.910
Do they give an address?

19:11.977 --> 19:14.012
They speculate she's
got contacts in the area.

19:14.079 --> 19:17.650
FBI is checking everybody in her past.

19:18.751 --> 19:19.752
Well, yeah. She's...

19:21.754 --> 19:23.656
This kid deserves to go to jail.

19:23.689 --> 19:25.858
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

19:25.924 --> 19:26.935
What do you keep looking at?

19:26.959 --> 19:28.661
Do you see those guys?

19:28.727 --> 19:31.163
Do you think that
they're checking us out?

19:31.229 --> 19:32.530
No.

19:32.665 --> 19:35.333
Do they look like agents to you?

19:35.400 --> 19:38.103
One of them looks like a
guy from William Morris.

19:38.170 --> 19:39.672
I don't mean show business agents.

19:39.738 --> 19:41.473
I mean federal agents.

19:41.539 --> 19:42.975
FBI?

19:43.041 --> 19:45.678
No, but so what if they are?

19:46.679 --> 19:48.046
What do you mean so what?

19:48.113 --> 19:51.149
Do you think that we should
be under surveillance?

19:51.216 --> 19:53.051
You know what, they
don't look like FBI agents

19:53.118 --> 19:55.921
and if they are, what do we
care? We didn't do anything.

19:55.988 --> 19:59.357
Can you just check
the napkin thing there

19:59.424 --> 20:01.625
for a microphone?

20:01.626 --> 20:01.693
For a microphone? You're kidding
me. What, what are you nuts?

20:01.694 --> 20:03.495
You're kidding me.
What, what are you nuts?

20:03.561 --> 20:05.097
No, just check it.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.599
They put the microphones,
they can plant them anywhere.

20:07.666 --> 20:09.134
Check, check the napkin.

20:09.201 --> 20:12.437
Give it just a quick
check. What's the big...

20:12.504 --> 20:13.614
I'm eating, I'm not checking out...

20:13.638 --> 20:14.940
What do... What are you crazy?

20:15.007 --> 20:17.175
Is, is, is, is that a blintz?

20:17.242 --> 20:18.543
It's a taco.

20:18.610 --> 20:19.812
Can I look in it?

20:19.878 --> 20:20.679
You want to look inside my taco?

20:20.746 --> 20:22.214
Yeah, can I?

20:22.280 --> 20:24.192
- Hey, hey, put down my...
- They have wireless microphones

20:24.216 --> 20:25.884
and they can put them any place.

20:25.951 --> 20:26.952
I just want to...

20:27.019 --> 20:28.353
Miss, can I get a check quickly?

20:28.420 --> 20:31.289
We got to get out of here.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.491
- Yeah, let me have this.
- I'm still eating.

20:33.558 --> 20:35.794
No, no, no, but don't,
don't talk into the taco.

20:35.861 --> 20:37.730
Here, here, miss, this is for you.

20:37.796 --> 20:39.264
Whatever. Thanks for everything.

20:39.331 --> 20:40.465
- We have to go.
- Okay.

20:40.532 --> 20:41.666
We have to go. Let's go.

20:41.734 --> 20:43.035
- Thank you.
- That's $60.

20:43.101 --> 20:44.178
That's all right, it's all right.

20:44.202 --> 20:45.637
It was good service.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.706
- Thank you.
- Come, come, quickly.

20:47.773 --> 20:49.674
- Sid...
- Thank you.

21:17.302 --> 21:18.862
I've been working on this list for you.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.216
It's some political books I
think you should check out.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.942
- You'll really like 'em.
- Hmm.

21:24.009 --> 21:26.544
Who's Chairman Mayo?

21:26.611 --> 21:28.380
You say it Mao.

21:28.446 --> 21:29.581
Mao. Mao, Mao.

21:29.647 --> 21:30.849
You should have the ladies

21:30.916 --> 21:32.951
in your reading group read these.

21:33.018 --> 21:36.488
They'll find these
writers very interesting.

21:36.554 --> 21:38.156
Oh, thanks.
