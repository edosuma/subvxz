01:59.221 --> 02:00.766
Reverend.

02:00.807 --> 02:03.770
Mr. Madlock, you remember
my lovely niece, Mary Ann,

02:03.812 --> 02:05.440
just returning home from school.

02:06.650 --> 02:07.694
Good afternoon sir.

02:09.406 --> 02:12.494
Mary Ann, you have grown
into a lovely young woman.

02:12.536 --> 02:14.289
Elizabeth, we do have
to have Mr. Madlock

02:14.330 --> 02:15.916
over for supper sometime.

02:15.959 --> 02:17.336
Absolutely, Sam.

02:17.377 --> 02:19.130
I'd be honored to
accept the invitation.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.635
But at the moment I have
some business to attend to.

02:21.676 --> 02:22.887
If you'll excuse me.

02:22.929 --> 02:23.972
Good day, sir.

02:26.643 --> 02:29.440
Good news, it's twins
but Sarah's gonna be fine.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.943
You just make sure
she drinks that tea

02:30.985 --> 02:33.739
twice a day and
gets a lot of rest.

02:33.780 --> 02:37.287
Well I sure appreciate you
comin' into town, Mama Thorn.

02:37.329 --> 02:39.123
I was afraid I was
gonna lose her.

02:39.166 --> 02:40.585
And I'll send you some ham

02:40.626 --> 02:42.505
just as soon as we
butcher them hogs.

02:42.546 --> 02:43.965
Nah, you just keep that ham.

02:44.007 --> 02:45.468
You got two more mouths to feed.

02:45.510 --> 02:46.679
You can eat it or sell it.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.350
I can get my own
supplies while I'm here.

02:52.563 --> 02:53.732
Thank you.

02:53.774 --> 02:54.817
Must I really
endure another evening

02:54.859 --> 02:56.612
with one of his friends?

02:56.654 --> 02:59.075
He has your best interest.

02:59.116 --> 03:01.203
But I want to
choose my own husband.

03:05.377 --> 03:07.256
You come into town
to feed your body?

03:07.297 --> 03:08.925
You need to be coming
into church on Sunday

03:08.967 --> 03:09.969
to feed your soul.

03:10.010 --> 03:11.472
But the Bible does say,

03:11.513 --> 03:13.809
"Remember the Sabbath
day, keep it holy."

03:13.850 --> 03:16.355
My church ain't no wooden box.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.859
For I can see the
sun rise and set.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.780
And for me every day is holy.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.668
Hey there, mind yourself.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.672
Hey, you stick to your
own damn business, kid.

03:30.713 --> 03:32.759
What's the meaning
of this, Madlock?

03:32.800 --> 03:33.635
We're here to
settle up a debt.

03:33.676 --> 03:35.430
I expect you recollect it.

03:35.472 --> 03:37.559
We paid that debt long ago.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.810
I ain't got no bone
to pick with you kid,

03:38.852 --> 03:40.439
now stay out of it.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.525
If you know what's good for
you, you oughta move along.

03:50.456 --> 03:52.709
Nobody going anywhere
until your uncle pays up.

03:52.752 --> 03:54.254
What are you, hard of hearing?

03:56.425 --> 03:57.385
- Come on!
- Now you're in for it,

03:57.426 --> 03:58.345
the both of ya!

04:00.473 --> 04:01.850
Behind a tree, boy!

04:01.892 --> 04:04.772
Elizabeth, you need to take
Mary Ann home, immediately.

04:50.977 --> 04:52.730
Why lady, you seem to
have gotten yourselves

04:52.772 --> 04:54.650
into quite a predicament.

04:54.692 --> 04:56.696
Please sir, we
are hopelessly stuck

04:56.737 --> 04:58.490
and have endured the
situation for far longer

04:58.532 --> 04:59.700
than we care to think about.

05:05.043 --> 05:07.047
I strongly urge you
to remove yourself

05:07.089 --> 05:09.092
from this vicinity with
the utmost hilarity

05:09.133 --> 05:11.722
or I'll give you a thrashin'
you won't soon forget.

06:06.692 --> 06:11.116
Forrest's the name, ma'am,
Nathan Bedford Forrest.

06:11.158 --> 06:14.372
I'm Ms. Montgomery and this
is my daughter, Mary Ann.

06:14.413 --> 06:16.585
We are indebted to you
for your kindness, sir.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.212
I'm always ready
to come to the aid

06:18.253 --> 06:19.923
of the fairer sex, ma'am.

06:19.965 --> 06:22.929
I'd be mighty obliged if I
could pay you a visit sometime.

06:23.763 --> 06:25.057
Certainly, Mr. Forrest.

06:25.099 --> 06:27.687
My husband, William
Montgomery went home to Jesus

06:27.729 --> 06:29.106
a few years ago.

06:29.148 --> 06:31.652
You may find us under
the governance of my uncle,

06:31.693 --> 06:33.530
Reverend Samuel M.
Cowan at Horne Lake.

06:34.866 --> 06:36.619
Mary Ann, we must
be getting home.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.125
Good day ladies.

06:41.419 --> 06:43.380
He is a fine young man.

06:43.422 --> 06:45.385
Pay him no
attention, Mary Ann.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.500
It's about time you
got here, young man.

07:28.542 --> 07:30.003
How do you know who I am?

07:30.045 --> 07:31.923
I hear
stories, sit down.

07:33.843 --> 07:35.930
I've heard a lot of
stories about you too.

07:35.972 --> 07:37.976
Some people say you're
a miracle worker.

07:38.017 --> 07:39.603
Some say you're a witch.

07:39.645 --> 07:41.565
I wanna know what you
do and how you do it.

07:41.606 --> 07:43.026
I'm a healer.

07:43.068 --> 07:44.905
You might call me a root doctor.

07:44.946 --> 07:48.369
But I don't bleed people
and I don't cut off limbs.

07:48.410 --> 07:52.626
What I do know is the plants
that grow around here,

07:52.668 --> 07:54.922
what they do and what
I can do with them.

07:54.963 --> 07:56.800
Well how do you
know all of this?

07:56.842 --> 07:58.345
From my mama and my grandmama.

07:59.846 --> 08:03.645
Women in my family been healin'
for the past thousand years.

08:03.686 --> 08:06.942
And I learn what I can from
the Indians and the darkies.

08:06.985 --> 08:09.613
Now all kinds of people
come to me with their pains

08:09.655 --> 08:12.035
and I give 'em my
poultices and potions

08:12.076 --> 08:13.495
and they get better.

08:13.537 --> 08:16.166
I just follow the
ways of the earth.

08:16.209 --> 08:18.129
Ways of the earth?

08:18.170 --> 08:19.297
What the hell does that mean?

08:19.339 --> 08:22.845
Ways of the earth
says, we all got gifts

08:22.886 --> 08:25.975
and we should use these
gifts to help each other.

08:26.017 --> 08:28.605
Ways of men say some men
are better than others

08:28.646 --> 08:29.899
'cause of the
color of their hide

08:29.940 --> 08:31.526
or that men are
better than women.

08:31.569 --> 08:33.530
That ain't right at
all and that's why

08:33.572 --> 08:35.450
everybody's so damn miserable.

08:36.534 --> 08:38.496
So I follow the
ways of the earth.

08:39.539 --> 08:41.126
I got another sort of problem.

08:41.169 --> 08:43.380
I met this girl and
she's real pretty

08:43.422 --> 08:46.052
and she's real sweet
and I wanna marry her.

08:46.093 --> 08:49.266
But her guardian's that hellfire
preacher Reverend Samuel.

08:49.308 --> 08:50.518
He don't think much of me.

08:50.559 --> 08:52.772
He don't think
much of me either.

08:52.813 --> 08:55.359
To him we're both sinners
headed straight for hell.

08:56.779 --> 08:58.532
But I know things
that he doesn't.

08:59.575 --> 09:00.744
Like what?

09:00.786 --> 09:02.956
You ever watched
the stars at night?

09:02.998 --> 09:05.293
I love to see 'em
light up the sky.

09:05.335 --> 09:07.046
All them stars
have their place,

09:07.089 --> 09:09.969
just like the reverend
and those society people.

09:11.262 --> 09:13.892
Once in a great while,
there'll be this comet

09:13.933 --> 09:16.855
that just comes
flashing across the sky,

09:16.897 --> 09:19.693
brighter than all of 'em,
makin' it's own path.

09:19.735 --> 09:22.449
You are that comet, boy.

09:22.490 --> 09:24.410
You are not gonna
stay a poor farmer

09:24.452 --> 09:26.413
with dirt under
your fingernails.

09:26.455 --> 09:29.544
You're gonna have a fine
big house and a business

09:29.586 --> 09:32.049
and you're gonna lead
men into battle someday.

09:32.090 --> 09:34.636
But I wanna marry
Marry Ann now.

09:34.678 --> 09:37.140
Let me tell you something
about them Christians.

09:37.182 --> 09:40.605
There ain't nothing they like
better than a reformed sinner.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.900
And that, I am.

09:46.449 --> 09:47.784
Forrest is it?

09:47.826 --> 09:50.372
No sir, Nathan Bedford
Forrest with two R's.

09:55.213 --> 09:58.260
I'm given to understand
that you are here to inquire

09:58.302 --> 10:00.848
about marrying my guileless

10:00.890 --> 10:03.603
and comely young
niece, Mary Ann.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.315
Yes sir I am.

10:05.356 --> 10:08.278
Am I correct to
understand that you are here

10:08.319 --> 10:10.532
to seek her hand in marriage?

10:10.573 --> 10:11.617
That is correct.

10:13.495 --> 10:16.542
"And the Lord God caused a
deep sleep to fall upon Adam.

10:16.584 --> 10:17.878
"And he slept.

10:17.919 --> 10:19.548
"And he took one of his ribs

10:19.589 --> 10:22.093
"and closed up the
flesh instead thereof.

10:22.135 --> 10:24.806
"And the rib which the Lord
God had taken from man,

10:24.848 --> 10:26.351
"made he a woman.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.772
"And brought unto her the man.

10:28.813 --> 10:31.986
"And Adam said, 'This
is now bone of my bones

10:32.028 --> 10:34.156
"and flesh of my flesh.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.492
"She shall be called woman

10:35.533 --> 10:38.038
"because she was
taken out of man.'

10:38.079 --> 10:41.002
"Therefore shall a man leave
his father and his mother

10:41.043 --> 10:43.005
"and shall cleave unto his wife.

10:43.046 --> 10:45.342
"And they shall be one flesh."

10:45.384 --> 10:48.639
Do you understand son, the
meaning of these scriptures?

10:49.933 --> 10:52.563
Sir, having only six
months of proper schooling

10:52.605 --> 10:54.566
and not being much familiar
with the Good Book,

10:54.608 --> 10:56.486
I cannot say.

10:56.528 --> 11:00.660
God is speaking here of the
seriousness of holy matrimony.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.123
Do you not comprehend this?

11:03.165 --> 11:05.628
I think I'd be the perfect
match for your niece.

11:05.669 --> 11:08.215
I would not even consent
to fraternity between

11:08.257 --> 11:10.928
you and my Mary Ann,
let alone a marriage.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.806
What are you thinking, son?

11:12.848 --> 11:15.102
With all due respect sir,
I believe I'd make as good

11:15.144 --> 11:17.356
of husband as any
for your niece.

11:17.398 --> 11:20.570
But according to your
reputation, you're a liar,

11:20.612 --> 11:22.657
a braggart, and a drunk.

11:22.699 --> 11:24.452
Miss Mary Ann, she's
a Christian girl.

11:25.829 --> 11:27.290
You're absolutely right, sir.

11:27.332 --> 11:29.210
And that's exactly why
I intend to marry her.

11:43.902 --> 11:46.031
Mama, everything's
going exactly the way

11:46.072 --> 11:47.075
I was hoping it would.

11:48.368 --> 11:50.664
You really think you
wanna marry that man?

11:50.706 --> 11:51.456
I do.

11:52.876 --> 11:54.755
You remember that
conversation we had?

11:56.090 --> 12:00.222
Mama, I'm going to marry
Nathan Bedford Forrest.

12:39.624 --> 12:41.586
Much obliged miss.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.048
Abigail, how is
your young one?

12:44.090 --> 12:46.636
We sent our doctor over
to your house yesterday.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.180
And he said she was
recovering rapidly

12:48.222 --> 12:49.850
from her fall off the horse.

12:50.768 --> 12:53.565
Ma'am, she was doing poorly

12:53.606 --> 12:57.363
but now she's doing much
better, thank you ma'am.

12:57.405 --> 12:58.365
Glad to hear that.

13:05.210 --> 13:08.006
Nathan, I am discomfited
by all this talk

13:08.048 --> 13:10.385
of sectional unease.

13:10.428 --> 13:12.431
What do you suppose
it signifies?

13:13.725 --> 13:15.812
Well I guess it all
boils down to the money.

13:15.853 --> 13:17.690
We Southerners want
to simplify things

13:17.732 --> 13:20.195
and the Yankees want
to complicate it.

13:20.236 --> 13:23.616
Well how is this tariff war
affecting our family business?

13:29.293 --> 13:30.838
It for sure ain't helping.

13:30.879 --> 13:33.008
I'd give a passel of gold
nuggets to go to Washington

13:33.050 --> 13:34.803
and knock some sense into 'em.

13:34.845 --> 13:36.598
Now darling, we must
not let our tempers

13:36.639 --> 13:37.892
get the best of us.

13:40.188 --> 13:40.939
Why numination?

13:43.235 --> 13:45.530
Whilst on the
topic of your temple,

13:47.158 --> 13:50.121
it is my acute desire
that you accompany me

13:50.163 --> 13:52.083
to church this Sunday.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.963
The parishioners
all want to meet you

13:55.005 --> 13:57.843
and as I surely am,
they are very anxious

13:57.885 --> 14:00.055
about your pending salvation.

14:00.096 --> 14:03.395
Well I don't need to listen
to that empty-headed holy Joe!

14:03.436 --> 14:06.525
Life is so much better when
you're a Christian, darling.

14:06.566 --> 14:09.405
God loves you and desires
that you be saved.

14:12.201 --> 14:14.664
While your concern for my
eternal soul is right touching

14:14.705 --> 14:16.959
there ain't no good gonna
come from me reading any book

14:17.001 --> 14:18.253
that I don't understand.

14:18.295 --> 14:20.424
I thought God helped those
who helped themselves.

14:23.554 --> 14:25.308
That's right, let's just focus

14:25.349 --> 14:27.728
on helping our family
right now, shall we?

14:27.769 --> 14:30.816
Well I guess there's gonna
be arduous times ahead.

14:30.859 --> 14:33.446
And why do you suppose such?

14:33.488 --> 14:36.201
'Cause those damn
Yanks can't be educated.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.123
Those know-it-alls think Boston
is the hub of the universe.

15:16.729 --> 15:21.529
Gentlemen, now that Tennessee
has enacted secession,

15:22.949 --> 15:26.038
there ain't no reason not to
join the Confederate Army.

15:26.079 --> 15:27.832
Everyone's
secessed these days.

15:27.874 --> 15:30.336
They should be, time for
us to get some blue Billys.

15:31.714 --> 15:33.175
So what say you Nathan?

15:33.216 --> 15:34.886
Well we ain't got no choice
since Lincoln's invaders

15:34.928 --> 15:36.472
has overrun our country.

15:36.514 --> 15:38.434
The war'll be
over by Christmas.

15:38.476 --> 15:41.022
One of us Confeds can easily
wipe out five Federals.

15:41.064 --> 15:44.194
Nathan, I need a word
with you in private.

15:49.078 --> 15:52.041
Nathan, I've known
you for a long time.

15:52.083 --> 15:53.418
And I knew your daddy.

15:54.588 --> 15:55.464
He was a good man.

15:58.176 --> 16:01.432
Your daddy left us too
soon, I believe it was '37.

16:01.474 --> 16:03.686
He was a good
blacksmith wasn't he?

16:03.728 --> 16:04.980
And didn't your mama remarry?

16:07.818 --> 16:09.948
It don't matter, I just
want, you know, when you sign

16:09.989 --> 16:13.036
this piece of paper now, you
are joining up as a private

16:13.078 --> 16:15.289
in our army and what means is,

16:15.332 --> 16:17.252
you will be going directly into

16:17.293 --> 16:20.632
Captain White's Mounted
Tennessee Rifles.

16:22.845 --> 16:23.972
Who might this boy be?

16:24.013 --> 16:25.766
That's my boy Willie.

16:25.808 --> 16:28.229
You interested in becoming
a Confederate soldier, lad?

16:28.271 --> 16:30.191
I just wanna hunt
Federals with my pop.

16:31.735 --> 16:34.031
I hear them Yankees are ugly
and they smell like a stable.

16:34.991 --> 16:36.535
I hear they consort with Satan.

16:37.620 --> 16:39.582
Well you are
absolutely correct son,

16:39.624 --> 16:41.293
I have seen that myself.

16:41.335 --> 16:42.587
Worse than vermin.

16:44.089 --> 16:47.929
Nathan, he's a bit below
the legal limit, age.

16:49.265 --> 16:51.728
But I'll twist some arms,
make sure we get him in.

17:43.025 --> 17:43.735
Morning, boss.

17:43.776 --> 17:45.196
Morning, men.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.491
As you know I'm a
Confederate officer, now.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.369
I have my own fightin' unit.

17:49.411 --> 17:51.289
We heard it's a
credit company, sir.

17:51.331 --> 17:54.169
That's right, Ben,
it's a cavalry unit.

17:54.211 --> 17:56.089
Any of you gentlemen
wanna join up?

17:59.136 --> 18:00.848
Do we get to
ride with you, sir?

18:00.889 --> 18:01.766
You bet.

18:03.185 --> 18:05.982
What about weapons, do we
get to hold our own guns?

18:06.024 --> 18:08.111
Not only will you
get your own weapons,

18:08.152 --> 18:10.740
but you'll be drilled
just like real soldiers.

18:10.782 --> 18:12.326
Glory be!

18:12.368 --> 18:14.371
Who's ready to fight for
God and Jefferson Davis?

18:15.415 --> 18:17.001
What about our freedom sir?

18:18.336 --> 18:20.382
I wanna have a
conversation with Apollo.

18:20.424 --> 18:22.719
He will tell you what I
have to say about that.

18:25.098 --> 18:28.646
You will be among the
finest riders in the South.

18:28.688 --> 18:29.689
We'll all be champions.

18:30.900 --> 18:32.945
And I am proud to
have you in my command.

18:36.409 --> 18:37.995
You
wish to see me sir?

18:38.038 --> 18:40.333
Yes, I have some good news
to share with you Apollo.

18:40.375 --> 18:42.002
Yes sir?

18:42.045 --> 18:43.631
Many of your people
has come to me in private

18:43.672 --> 18:45.091
to discuss their conditions,

18:45.133 --> 18:47.429
talkin' to me about
their liberty.

18:47.471 --> 18:50.225
As of today, I'm closing down
my slave trading business.

18:59.115 --> 19:01.620
Forgive me, sir.

19:01.662 --> 19:04.333
Am I assuming you're
giving us our freedom?

19:05.335 --> 19:07.547
Yes Apollo, y'all are free.

19:09.175 --> 19:13.891
But sir, what about
your business and money?

19:17.898 --> 19:20.819
Well I guess the business
will absorb the loss.

19:29.042 --> 19:29.794
Praise be.

19:31.798 --> 19:34.719
All who wish to stay here
may stay on as laborers.

19:34.761 --> 19:38.016
And all who wish to
leave are free to go.

19:38.058 --> 19:39.728
I understand sir.

22:02.768 --> 22:05.606
Well Senator Haynes, it's
a pleasure to meet you.

22:05.648 --> 22:09.404
I thank you for coming all the
way over here from Tennessee

22:09.446 --> 22:10.739
to talk with me.

22:10.782 --> 22:14.412
I sincerely appreciate
you taking the time out

22:14.455 --> 22:17.292
of your very busy
schedule to meet with me.

22:17.335 --> 22:20.048
Now the primary
focus of your letter

22:20.089 --> 22:24.597
was regarding your concerns
about promotion with

22:24.639 --> 22:28.061
Nathan Bedford Forrest to the
rank of Brigadier General.

22:28.104 --> 22:29.648
Yes, General.

22:29.689 --> 22:32.778
And you have to understand
it's with a heavy heart

22:32.819 --> 22:34.531
that I'm here today.

22:34.572 --> 22:38.831
Back home, we would
like nothing better

22:38.872 --> 22:43.547
than you have a bona fide hero
from the state of Tennessee.

22:44.715 --> 22:47.471
So you do not approve
of his promotion?

22:47.512 --> 22:48.931
I definitely do not.

22:50.225 --> 22:52.729
Do you feel that he's
unfit for this position?

22:52.771 --> 22:57.529
I feel he's unfit to serve
as an officer of any rank

22:58.615 --> 23:00.451
in this confederacy, period.

23:02.204 --> 23:04.751
Well senator, those are
some pretty harsh words.

23:04.792 --> 23:06.336
Please explain.

23:06.378 --> 23:09.842
This is not hearsay,
this is what I've seen.

23:09.884 --> 23:13.808
I've had the privilege of
being at two officers' meetings

23:13.849 --> 23:14.976
with this man.

23:15.018 --> 23:17.522
These were round table meetings,

23:17.564 --> 23:20.652
looking for strategy and ideas

23:20.695 --> 23:23.324
to send those Yankees
back where they came from.

23:24.659 --> 23:27.205
Well sometimes those
meetings can be productive.

23:28.416 --> 23:31.379
During the meeting,
the whole meeting,

23:31.421 --> 23:34.928
Forrest sat on his
ass in the corner,

23:34.969 --> 23:38.058
cross legged, like an Indian.

23:38.099 --> 23:39.769
He didn't say a word,

23:39.811 --> 23:43.692
didn't try to contribute
anything to the conversation.

23:44.528 --> 23:46.197
Reminds me of my firstborn

23:46.239 --> 23:48.618
when he was maybe
five years old.

23:48.659 --> 23:51.624
Exactly, totally
disrespectful.

23:51.665 --> 23:53.877
He saw no reason to be there.

23:55.296 --> 23:57.008
Okay, what else?

23:57.049 --> 23:58.844
At the second meeting,

23:58.885 --> 24:02.016
Forrest brought his
private guards with him.

24:02.058 --> 24:04.688
Some officers
choose to do that.

24:04.729 --> 24:09.488
General, his private guards
were darkies, all black!

24:14.037 --> 24:16.291
They're former slaves of his.

24:16.332 --> 24:20.005
And he's proud of it, he calls
them by their first name.

24:21.968 --> 24:25.599
Lord, Lord, that does
seem a bit unusual.

24:27.268 --> 24:30.148
The other officers
don't wanna work with him.

24:31.651 --> 24:35.867
They understand, there
must be some kind of order

24:36.576 --> 24:37.787
on the battlefield.

24:37.828 --> 24:39.874
Forrest is nothing
more than a guerilla.

24:41.209 --> 24:45.174
Senator, I promise,
I will look into this.

24:45.216 --> 24:48.430
What I need for you to
do, as soon as you can

24:48.472 --> 24:50.099
is provide me with reports

24:50.141 --> 24:52.312
from some of the
officers present.

24:52.354 --> 24:55.734
Now their conclusions did not
have to coincide with yours.

24:55.776 --> 24:59.282
But I'd like the reports to
corroborate your findings

24:59.324 --> 25:01.035
and what you've told me.

25:01.077 --> 25:04.249
It'll take a little
time but I'll get it done.

25:04.291 --> 25:06.879
Senator, I will await
your correspondence.

25:56.841 --> 25:57.592
Well.

25:59.929 --> 26:01.849
Here's sage to guard you.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.731
Rosemary for remembrance.

26:08.194 --> 26:11.115
Blessings of the mountains
for a safe journey.

26:13.452 --> 26:16.249
Beggin' your pardon, but
you ain't gonna need these

26:16.291 --> 26:17.251
where you're going.

26:53.272 --> 26:54.607
Doc.

26:54.649 --> 26:56.152
What is it?

26:56.194 --> 26:57.571
Lines are broken
in three places,

26:57.612 --> 26:59.783
we need to evacuate immediately.

26:59.825 --> 27:01.035
I can't move out right now,

27:01.077 --> 27:03.289
I got too many men
I gotta tend to.

27:03.331 --> 27:06.795
Muster up your walking
wounded and bug out.

27:06.837 --> 27:09.801
Let me see if I can get
this man to sit up and walk.

27:09.842 --> 27:11.721
- You're on your own doc.
- All right.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.645
I can't do it doc.

27:16.687 --> 27:18.315
He can walk if he wears these.

27:19.192 --> 27:20.235
And who are you?

27:20.277 --> 27:21.321
I'm Mama Thorn.

27:22.489 --> 27:24.576
Well now, I'll see.

27:24.618 --> 27:26.245
Put 'em on, he'll
be able to go.

27:27.665 --> 27:29.710
Tell him to go cut himself
a walking stick over there.

27:29.752 --> 27:32.548
There's plenty of dead limbs,
don't take from a living tree.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.101
Get your boots on
boy, you can walk.

28:00.889 --> 28:04.103
Here, use this.

28:04.145 --> 28:05.647
That's yours anyway.

28:08.110 --> 28:09.529
You get along now.

28:09.571 --> 28:11.825
You tell you officers, when
you go through those woods,

28:11.867 --> 28:14.371
don't shoot anything
you're not gonna eat.

28:14.412 --> 28:16.124
How are you able to do that?

28:16.165 --> 28:18.085
I couldn't make him walk.

28:18.127 --> 28:19.338
That's what I do.

28:19.379 --> 28:21.675
We ain't got no fancy
doctors in these parts

28:21.717 --> 28:23.011
so I does the healing.

30:35.991 --> 30:37.911
He's gone to meet his maker.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.125
Earth
ain't ready for him yet.

30:42.419 --> 30:45.634
There's nothing you can
do for him, he's gone.

30:45.675 --> 30:46.468
Maybe not.

30:51.685 --> 30:53.647
Oh yeah, there is
something I can do.

31:05.292 --> 31:07.922
Hail fire, purest
of all elements.

32:01.223 --> 32:02.224
Oh my Lord.

32:11.532 --> 32:15.497
I have never seen anything
like that in all my life.

32:27.184 --> 32:28.437
Yes, Williams?

32:28.478 --> 32:30.107
All present and
accounted for, sir

32:30.148 --> 32:32.360
Why am I still hearing
gunfire somewhere?

32:32.402 --> 32:33.528
Target practice?

32:33.571 --> 32:35.365
No sir, a few skirmishers

32:35.407 --> 32:37.035
still causing us
a bit of trouble.

32:38.204 --> 32:40.124
Skirmishers, from where?

32:40.165 --> 32:43.004
I don't know, sir,
we'll take care of it.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.047
Please do.

33:05.208 --> 33:06.252
Yes Williams?

33:06.294 --> 33:08.047
All present and
accounted for, sir

33:09.675 --> 33:11.511
Just like
yesterday, you tell me

33:11.553 --> 33:12.888
all present and accounted for

33:12.931 --> 33:16.395
yet I'm still hearing
gunfire in the distance.

33:16.437 --> 33:18.315
Yes sir, still working on it.

33:18.357 --> 33:22.280
That gunfire kept me
awake most of the night!

33:22.321 --> 33:23.240
Likewise, sir.

33:24.408 --> 33:26.328
Williams, we're
having a scouting party

33:26.371 --> 33:28.165
drop behind us tomorrow.

33:28.207 --> 33:31.254
I want to find out who
these troublemakers are.

33:31.295 --> 33:33.007
Do you understand?

33:33.048 --> 33:34.426
Yes sir.

33:34.468 --> 33:35.177
See to it.

33:58.134 --> 34:00.764
Why am I still hearing
this, Williams?

34:00.805 --> 34:03.143
More skirmishers
than we thought, sir.

34:03.184 --> 34:05.814
So where are they coming from?

34:05.855 --> 34:10.071
Well, our scouts captured
one of them, briefly.

34:10.112 --> 34:12.659
Briefly, why briefly?

34:12.701 --> 34:15.706
I'm afraid the prisoner
slipped away, sir.

34:15.748 --> 34:18.210
So Williams, what did this

34:18.252 --> 34:20.715
briefly held
prisoner have to say?

34:21.884 --> 34:24.054
He was part of a
larger group of cavalry,

34:24.094 --> 34:26.056
commanded by this
General Forrest.

34:26.099 --> 34:30.774
Forrest, Nathan Bedford Forrest!

34:32.110 --> 34:33.527
I don't know for sure, sir.

34:33.570 --> 34:36.241
All right, tomorrow
we double time,

34:36.284 --> 34:38.328
do you understand, Williams?

34:38.370 --> 34:42.043
We outrun these sons of
bitches, do you understand?

34:42.085 --> 34:43.212
Absolutely, sir.

35:04.958 --> 35:05.751
Williams!

35:07.004 --> 35:08.088
Yes sir.

35:08.130 --> 35:11.761
Who the hell is firing
that cannon at us?

35:11.804 --> 35:14.099
I think it's still
Forrest's men, sir.

35:14.141 --> 35:16.812
How long has this
been going on, Williams?

35:16.854 --> 35:19.525
Well over a week, sir.

35:19.567 --> 35:22.447
And where did they
get the cannons from?

35:24.492 --> 35:28.290
Must be a very small force
that can travel this fast.

35:28.332 --> 35:30.044
I would hope so sir.

35:30.085 --> 35:32.088
So tomorrow we turn about face

35:32.130 --> 35:34.092
and strike them at midday!

35:34.134 --> 35:35.470
Stop the advance, sir?

35:35.511 --> 35:36.263
Only briefly.

35:37.974 --> 35:41.730
I want to show this General
Forrest who he's dealing with.

36:08.944 --> 36:09.946
Colonel?

36:14.830 --> 36:19.546
Williams, I am so damn
tired of this already!

36:22.634 --> 36:27.310
15 days now, 15 days!

36:32.443 --> 36:35.657
Why don't they have the
courage to fight us like men,

36:35.698 --> 36:37.870
they're just wearing us out!

36:39.247 --> 36:41.960
I think that may
be the plan, sir.

36:42.001 --> 36:46.718
All right, one more day and
we'll be close to Cedar Bluff.

36:48.805 --> 36:53.438
Do we have any idea of
this man's fighting force?

36:53.480 --> 36:55.483
Very difficult to say sir.

36:57.570 --> 36:59.741
Then we bring this to an end.

36:59.783 --> 37:03.372
Crush these scurrying bugs
like the vermin they are!

42:02.891 --> 42:04.311
Y'all see anything?

42:04.353 --> 42:05.480
- No.
- No sir.

42:11.407 --> 42:12.909
I know they're
still out there.

42:12.951 --> 42:15.080
Glory, when is
this rain gonna end?

42:15.121 --> 42:17.208
I hope it never ends,
it's in our favor.

42:18.293 --> 42:20.171
It makes everything
so slippery.

42:20.213 --> 42:22.217
Yeah, we're used to
that, the Yanks are not.

42:23.636 --> 42:26.266
Yeah, I'm sure they're
crying about the weather here.

42:26.307 --> 42:29.020
What are we supposed to
do with Streight's men?

42:30.273 --> 42:31.357
I need to talk
to the Lieutenant

42:31.400 --> 42:33.069
and see how much
artillery we have left.

42:33.946 --> 42:35.866
How many prisoners do we got?

42:35.907 --> 42:37.160
About 30 right now.

42:38.370 --> 42:40.415
We're about to get
a whole lot more.

42:40.457 --> 42:42.753
Look out, the general's
got a plan brewing.

42:45.674 --> 42:48.637
Ah, Lieutenant we were
just talking about you.

42:49.807 --> 42:51.351
General Hill wants
to know how many

42:51.393 --> 42:53.104
artillery pieces we have left.

42:56.651 --> 42:58.947
We got maybe two
that'll still fire.

42:58.989 --> 43:00.700
How many pieces
exactly do we have

43:00.742 --> 43:02.244
of artillery that won't fire?

43:03.455 --> 43:06.084
We might have enough
pieces to make 10,

43:06.127 --> 43:07.087
but it ain't working.

43:07.128 --> 43:08.631
Yankees got most of 'em.

43:10.175 --> 43:11.386
Does most of 'em have
the wheels and carriages?

43:11.427 --> 43:13.097
I believe so, I
believe we got 10.

43:14.600 --> 43:17.271
So we got two that works
and 10 that could roll?

43:18.731 --> 43:21.027
I think with a little bit
of work we can manage that.

43:21.069 --> 43:22.947
So what're you
thinking General?

43:22.989 --> 43:24.200
Let's make it
look like we have

43:24.241 --> 43:26.746
a whole more artillery
than we really have.

43:26.787 --> 43:28.040
What's the point of that?

43:28.081 --> 43:28.916
Well he took a beating.

43:28.957 --> 43:30.377
I'm gonna ask him to surrender.

43:31.253 --> 43:33.549
You can't be serious, General.

43:33.591 --> 43:35.177
I am serious.

43:35.218 --> 43:38.391
They still got three times
the infantry that we have.

43:38.433 --> 43:39.393
He don't know that.

43:40.644 --> 43:42.940
I can't wait to
see if this works.

43:42.982 --> 43:46.488
So what do you want
me to do exactly?

43:46.530 --> 43:48.909
I want all our
artillery in a circle.

43:48.951 --> 43:50.453
What about the camp?

43:50.495 --> 43:53.166
Don't show as much of
them but have 'em out there.

43:54.418 --> 43:56.297
How soon can you get this done?

43:56.338 --> 43:57.507
Couple hours.

43:57.549 --> 43:58.968
Get it done as
fast as you can.

43:59.010 --> 44:02.098
If you need extra
cannons use tree trunks.

44:03.810 --> 44:05.688
Yes sir, I'll try
to make that happen.

44:22.133 --> 44:25.013
"Colonel Streight I must demand
an unconditional surrender

44:25.055 --> 44:27.309
"of your force as
prisoners of war

44:27.350 --> 44:30.064
"or I shall have every
man put to the sword.

44:30.106 --> 44:32.276
"You are aware of the
overpowering force

44:32.317 --> 44:33.987
"I have at my command.

44:34.029 --> 44:35.531
"And this demand is made

44:35.573 --> 44:38.161
"to prevent further
effusion of blood.

44:38.203 --> 44:40.749
"I am, sir, very respectfully,

44:40.790 --> 44:44.088
"your obedient servant,
Nathan Bedford Forrest,

44:44.130 --> 44:47.093
"Brigadier General
of Cavalry, CS Army."

44:50.850 --> 44:52.644
Tell General
Forrest that I shall

44:52.686 --> 44:55.524
meet him here in these
woods in five minutes.

44:57.486 --> 44:58.237
Yes, sir.

45:31.837 --> 45:33.633
General Forrest,
I will not surrender

45:33.674 --> 45:36.053
unless I know that your
force is equal to mine.

45:49.577 --> 45:52.414
Great God man, how
many guns have you got?

45:52.457 --> 45:54.794
Well that's about 15
I've counted so far.

46:13.577 --> 46:15.622
Most of 'em are back
behind those mounds.

46:16.833 --> 46:18.168
Let's put a nail
in it, Colonel.

46:19.670 --> 46:21.883
I got enough manpower to
whip you out of your boots.

46:23.134 --> 46:24.888
Looks like a good
many of them, sir.

46:26.933 --> 46:27.893
That's what it is.

46:31.149 --> 46:32.651
I tell you what, sir.

46:32.693 --> 46:35.114
I'll allow y'all to keep your
sidearms and your baggage.

46:42.210 --> 46:44.714
I'll even provide your
men with food and water.

47:36.721 --> 47:38.724
How could you
bamboozle me, Forrest!

47:38.766 --> 47:42.690
You have maybe 400
men, I've got 1700!

47:42.731 --> 47:46.029
I could have easily bested you
in a head to head engagement.

47:46.070 --> 47:49.326
Down here we call that
mere supposition, sir.

47:49.367 --> 47:51.622
I demand that
you return our arms

47:51.663 --> 47:54.084
so that we can fight
it out to the end.

47:55.378 --> 47:57.423
All is fair in love
and war, Colonel.

48:12.950 --> 48:14.829
I was mightily
heartened to hear that you

48:14.870 --> 48:17.166
received a furlough
to visit us back home.

48:17.207 --> 48:18.334
Yes ma'am.

48:18.377 --> 48:20.923
It's been 18 months
since my last visit.

48:20.964 --> 48:23.093
Halcyon days.

48:23.134 --> 48:24.887
How's our son Willie?

48:24.930 --> 48:27.767
Oh, he's made a fine,
fine Confederate officer.

48:27.810 --> 48:28.894
Just like his father.

48:30.606 --> 48:34.487
Mary Ann, Lincoln's
committed so many war crimes

48:34.530 --> 48:36.116
we are barely making headway.

48:37.534 --> 48:41.124
I hear his radicals recently
suspended Habeas Corpus

48:41.166 --> 48:45.466
across the North so they can
silence anti-war advocates.

48:45.507 --> 48:47.218
What about that
naval blockade.

48:47.260 --> 48:50.140
What else should we expect
from a Northern coercionist?

49:44.025 --> 49:45.611
That battle shoulda
never been fought.

49:45.653 --> 49:48.366
The whole war shoulda
never been fought.

49:48.407 --> 49:50.578
Well boys, we
wouldn't be in this fix

49:50.620 --> 49:52.498
if it hadn't been
for old Lincoln.

49:52.540 --> 49:54.251
Don't count a
Yankee sir, traitors!

49:56.254 --> 49:59.218
They think they so,
what's the word, superior.

49:59.260 --> 50:01.305
That's what they
want us to think.

50:01.347 --> 50:03.100
The North's printing
lies about us.

50:04.644 --> 50:07.483
There was an article said
I use women as shields.

50:07.524 --> 50:09.694
They say I'm beatin'
y'all with chains?

50:11.239 --> 50:13.702
Yeah, and I drink my coffee
out of Yankee skulls.

50:13.743 --> 50:16.331
Pretty soon they'll be saying
I eat babies for breakfast.

50:17.124 --> 50:17.959
Pure bullshit.

50:18.960 --> 50:20.213
You got some moonshine,

50:20.254 --> 50:22.300
best moonshine on this
side of the Mississippi.

50:23.803 --> 50:26.223
No thanks, my staff does
all my drinking for me.

50:28.018 --> 50:31.107
My people ain't gonna never
see 40 acres and a mule.

50:32.192 --> 50:33.736
All them riches going up North.

50:34.905 --> 50:36.825
Why they say we
fightin' for slavery?

50:36.867 --> 50:38.829
We're not fightin' for slavery.

50:38.870 --> 50:40.957
Look at us, slavery is dead.

50:42.209 --> 50:43.754
Well boys, I guess
we'll hit the hay

50:43.796 --> 50:45.047
before we get wallpapered.

56:35.155 --> 56:39.454
Well senator, I trust you
had a safe, uneventful trip.

56:39.496 --> 56:42.250
It's been nearly two years
since our last meeting

56:42.293 --> 56:45.549
and I believe I was waiting
for some correspondence

56:45.590 --> 56:49.013
regarding your position
on Nathan Bedford Forrest.

56:49.054 --> 56:51.433
A lot has happened since then.

56:52.977 --> 56:56.359
The officers don't want to go
on the record against Forrest.

56:56.400 --> 56:59.155
Have you changed your
position regarding Forrest?

56:59.197 --> 57:00.616
I definitely have not.

57:00.657 --> 57:04.414
In the past two years, he
has become somewhat of a legend

57:04.456 --> 57:05.708
among his troops.

57:05.750 --> 57:07.879
He's dangerous, General.

57:07.920 --> 57:11.635
Dangerous to our government
and dangerous to our cause.

57:11.677 --> 57:16.059
Senator, Major General
Forrest's last battle,

57:19.023 --> 57:22.362
in Northern Mississippi
at Brice's Cross Roads,

57:22.403 --> 57:25.283
it's a little town near
Baldwin, Mississippi.

57:25.326 --> 57:27.454
I'm familiar with
that engagement.

57:27.496 --> 57:32.254
Forrest was confronted
by General Samuel Sturgis.

57:34.090 --> 57:38.849
And Sturgis had a command
of over 8,300 troops.

57:40.560 --> 57:43.816
Whereas Forrest
had 3,500 cavalry.

57:45.443 --> 57:49.200
Sturgis was soundly
and decisively defeated

57:50.452 --> 57:52.289
at Brice's Cross Roads.

57:52.330 --> 57:54.793
Some people call it
the Battle of Gunpoint.

57:54.835 --> 57:57.799
Sturgis retreated
back towards Memphis

57:57.840 --> 57:59.969
with his troops
in total disarray.

58:01.722 --> 58:05.896
Forrest captured 1,600
men and a supply line

58:05.937 --> 58:07.357
that we can certainly use.

58:08.567 --> 58:11.072
In fact, people in
the area, the locals,

58:11.113 --> 58:15.203
call it an old fashioned
Mississippi butt whoopin'.

58:16.582 --> 58:21.130
I am not going to decommission
Major General Forrest.

58:22.633 --> 58:25.012
In fact, and this comes
from the bottom of my heart.

58:25.054 --> 58:29.145
I wish I had a dozen
General Forrests.

58:29.186 --> 58:32.985
Maybe we could turn this war
around for us and in our favor.

58:33.026 --> 58:34.696
What about our
troops, General?

58:34.737 --> 58:37.868
I've got news for ya,
they're liable to kill him.

58:37.910 --> 58:41.249
And if they don't, I
might do it myself.

58:41.290 --> 58:42.042
Good day!

59:07.127 --> 59:08.046
Boy, shhh.

59:09.130 --> 59:10.883
I know you ain't dead yet.

59:10.926 --> 59:13.137
But you better act like you are.

59:15.892 --> 59:18.105
Missus, who the hell are you?

59:18.146 --> 59:21.819
You just killed my son!

59:21.861 --> 59:24.699
Ma'am, my orders are to
remove anyone from this area.

59:24.741 --> 59:26.160
You must leave.

59:26.202 --> 59:28.372
He ain't resisting no more.

59:28.414 --> 59:30.209
Now leave us be!

59:30.250 --> 59:31.503
Ma'am, my orders.

59:31.545 --> 59:34.466
Orders, you just
carried out your orders.

59:34.508 --> 59:39.225
Now, a woman has got a
right to bury her child.

59:39.266 --> 59:42.730
You, just go on
back to your unit.

59:42.772 --> 59:44.609
I'm takin' my boy home.

59:46.487 --> 59:47.239
Yes ma'am.

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:42.209
Swamp water, dark and deep,

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:45.005
all my secrets you will keep.

01:01:13.305 --> 01:01:15.057
It's about time you
woke up, Stuart.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:18.605
Is this heaven?

01:01:18.647 --> 01:01:20.025
Do I look like an angel?

01:01:21.235 --> 01:01:23.405
Not exactly, but
this is the best place

01:01:23.447 --> 01:01:25.659
I've been in a long time.

01:01:25.701 --> 01:01:26.619
Where am I?

01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:28.832
Who are you?

01:01:28.873 --> 01:01:31.503
I'm Mama Thorn and
this is my swamp.

01:01:31.545 --> 01:01:34.049
Blue coats came through
shootin' so I brought you here.

01:01:35.343 --> 01:01:38.849
We were scouting, we
were gonna ambush 'em.

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:40.059
But they got you first.

01:01:41.228 --> 01:01:42.605
Ain't there enough
hardship in this world

01:01:42.647 --> 01:01:45.235
without you menfolk killing
and wounding each other?

01:01:46.112 --> 01:01:47.656
It's the war.

01:01:47.697 --> 01:01:49.450
Rich man's war.

01:01:49.492 --> 01:01:51.705
They made you sign
up, didn't they?

01:01:51.746 --> 01:01:52.748
Yes ma'am.

01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:55.085
You're from Columbia.

01:01:55.127 --> 01:01:56.629
How did you know?

01:01:56.672 --> 01:01:59.009
You scratched it
onto your belt buckle.

01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:01.680
Have they taken Columbia?

01:02:01.722 --> 01:02:04.810
No, but Sherman's
coming through here.

01:02:04.852 --> 01:02:06.939
I got cousins in Pennsylvania.

01:02:06.981 --> 01:02:09.068
They're with Sherman now.

01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:10.696
I just don't want
to fight anymore.

01:02:11.781 --> 01:02:13.450
You don't have to.

01:02:13.492 --> 01:02:16.623
When you're ready to
travel, head out West.

01:02:16.665 --> 01:02:18.835
I know a passage
through the mountains.

01:02:18.876 --> 01:02:21.047
There's life and
freedom out there.

01:02:22.007 --> 01:02:23.593
I can't desert
the Confederacy.

01:02:25.012 --> 01:02:26.515
Do you wanna be
shootin' at your cousins?

01:02:27.558 --> 01:02:28.268
No ma'am.

01:02:29.478 --> 01:02:31.607
You and how many
other boys like you

01:02:31.649 --> 01:02:34.487
carve their name and the
name of their hometown

01:02:34.529 --> 01:02:37.283
on their belt buckle
in case they got killed

01:02:37.325 --> 01:02:39.412
someplace where nobody knew 'em.

01:02:39.453 --> 01:02:42.209
I know the South is your home

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:45.548
but slavery is the greatest
evil on this earth.

01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:47.468
It's good that it's over.

01:02:47.509 --> 01:02:50.139
But this land can't heal
until the fightin's done.

01:02:51.308 --> 01:02:52.435
Head out West.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:56.483
Everybody already
thinks you're dead.

01:02:56.525 --> 01:02:59.238
And if you go back to
that war, you will be.

01:03:00.573 --> 01:03:03.412
You can make a good life
for your family out there.

01:03:03.453 --> 01:03:06.501
Can you, can you get
the message to my family?

01:03:06.542 --> 01:03:08.087
I'll find a way
to let them know.

01:03:09.172 --> 01:03:10.049
I sure am hungry.

01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:11.969
Is there anything to eat?

01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:14.515
One thing I got
plenty of is food.

01:03:14.556 --> 01:03:16.769
Rest, I'll get you something.

01:03:22.612 --> 01:03:24.365
General, I have an
important message for you.

01:03:24.407 --> 01:03:25.367
Just read it to me.

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:34.090
"This is to inform you
that General Robert E. Lee

01:03:34.132 --> 01:03:37.012
"has surrendered the Army
of Virginia on April 9th.

01:03:37.053 --> 01:03:39.308

Looks mighty tough, sir.

01:07:14.932 --> 01:07:16.017
Ain't much of nothing.

01:07:19.482 --> 01:07:20.233
Johnny!

01:07:31.544 --> 01:07:34.424
Good afternoon,
General, good to see you.

01:07:34.466 --> 01:07:36.636
Johnny, this is
my wife, Mary Ann.

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:37.429
Ma'am.

01:07:39.141 --> 01:07:41.311
Mary Ann, this is my
old second lieutenant.

01:07:43.231 --> 01:07:46.028
Good to see you Johnny, what
brings you all the way up here?

01:07:49.826 --> 01:07:52.622
There's an organization
I'd like to introduce you to.

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:56.546
I might could be
interested, what's it called?

01:07:58.048 --> 01:08:01.262
It's called the Ku
Klux Klan, KKK for short.

01:08:02.848 --> 01:08:04.184
What kind of name is that?

01:08:04.226 --> 01:08:06.271
Well, it's a
nonsense name, really.

01:08:06.313 --> 01:08:08.483
Me and the boys came up
with it, down in Pulaski,

01:08:08.525 --> 01:08:10.152
Christmas Eve, '65.

01:08:11.781 --> 01:08:13.199
Well what they about, Johnny?

01:08:13.242 --> 01:08:16.122
We give assistance
to war widows,

01:08:16.162 --> 01:08:18.959
orphans, and veterans
of all races.

01:08:22.006 --> 01:08:23.843
Well what you want me to do?

01:08:23.885 --> 01:08:26.013
I'd like to introduce
you to our leader,

01:08:26.055 --> 01:08:27.683
George Washington Gordon.

01:08:27.725 --> 01:08:29.144
I know Gordon.

01:08:29.185 --> 01:08:30.522
We wanna know if
we can count on you

01:08:30.563 --> 01:08:32.108
for your support and leadership.

01:08:34.028 --> 01:08:35.572
Well Johnny, I'd be glad

01:08:35.613 --> 01:08:37.658
to assist you folks
any way I can.

01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:48.301
May I speak to you Apollo?

01:08:48.344 --> 01:08:49.888
Yes sir?

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:51.140
I have some gentlemen
stopping by tonight,

01:08:51.182 --> 01:08:52.643
I'd like for you to meet 'em.

01:08:54.645 --> 01:08:55.982
They've been here before.

01:08:56.024 --> 01:08:58.319
They're with that group
called the Ku Klux Klan.

01:09:00.198 --> 01:09:01.325
A while back, I asked them

01:09:01.366 --> 01:09:03.787
to open up an all-black
chapter in Nashville.

01:09:04.997 --> 01:09:06.082
Okay.

01:09:06.125 --> 01:09:07.962
Now they been dragging
their feet on this

01:09:08.002 --> 01:09:10.424
but if you join
up, it might help.

01:09:11.676 --> 01:09:12.636
Uh huh.

01:09:14.932 --> 01:09:17.685
I thought you'd be
a lot more interested.

01:09:17.728 --> 01:09:21.652
Well, I heard about this
group, not good things.

01:09:22.612 --> 01:09:23.822
Like what?

01:09:23.863 --> 01:09:25.450
Like folks getting hurt.

01:09:26.452 --> 01:09:28.330
Some gettin' lynched.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:29.122
Lynched?

01:09:32.212 --> 01:09:34.591
How reliable is
this information?

01:09:34.631 --> 01:09:38.890
My brother, he's
seen it, preacher too.

01:09:43.231 --> 01:09:46.486
Damn, hopefully it's
just a couple bad apples.

01:09:48.072 --> 01:09:51.370
Do me a favor, sit
in on this meeting.

01:09:51.412 --> 01:09:52.915
Might help me figure this out.

01:09:54.459 --> 01:09:55.168
Certainly, sir.

01:10:01.053 --> 01:10:04.768
Abigail, would you
mind doing me a favor?

01:10:04.810 --> 01:10:05.561
Yes ma'am.

01:10:06.855 --> 01:10:08.859
Please inform Mr.
Forrest that I am at church

01:10:08.901 --> 01:10:11.363
for the evening, if he asks.

01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:14.952
But Mr. Forrest has guests.

01:10:15.829 --> 01:10:16.915
I'm aware of that.

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:20.796
Ma'am, this is a bit unusual.

01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:24.010
I do not wish to
be in the company

01:10:24.052 --> 01:10:25.596
of this gentleman, Abigail.

01:10:27.391 --> 01:10:28.643
Please inform Mr. Forrest

01:10:28.685 --> 01:10:30.646
of my whereabouts
when he inquires.

01:10:32.108 --> 01:10:32.859
Yes ma'am.

01:10:44.379 --> 01:10:46.465
Hey, come on in, Nathan.

01:10:47.301 --> 01:10:49.053
My my, it's been a piece.

01:10:50.472 --> 01:10:51.766
Mama Thorn.

01:10:51.808 --> 01:10:55.148
You here to say hello,
or you looking for advice?

01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:56.483
Both.

01:10:56.525 --> 01:10:59.530
Boy, this place ain't
changed much in 15 years.

01:10:59.572 --> 01:11:02.326
This place ain't changed
much in a thousand years.

01:11:02.368 --> 01:11:03.662
What's on your mind Nathan?

01:11:04.915 --> 01:11:06.751
Well a while back
I joined this group,

01:11:06.792 --> 01:11:09.172
and now they're calling me
the leader of this group.

01:11:09.213 --> 01:11:11.885
You're talking about
the Ku Klux Klan.

01:11:11.926 --> 01:11:12.803
I'm familiar with it.

01:11:14.348 --> 01:11:15.641
But I think you're more of
a figurehead than a leader.

01:11:15.683 --> 01:11:17.185
I may be.

01:11:17.228 --> 01:11:18.646
Me and a couple of us
thought it'd be a good idea

01:11:18.688 --> 01:11:21.276
open up an all black
chapter in Nashville.

01:11:22.736 --> 01:11:24.532
That sounds
almost progressive.

01:11:25.449 --> 01:11:27.788
Yeah, but I don't know.

01:11:27.829 --> 01:11:30.083
I really wanted Apollo to
be the head of that chapter.

01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:31.794
He don't want nothing
to do with it.

01:11:31.836 --> 01:11:33.798
You can trust Apollo.

01:11:33.839 --> 01:11:35.425
You respect his opinion.

01:11:35.468 --> 01:11:37.429
Yes I do, he's been
a lifelong friend.

01:11:38.431 --> 01:11:40.101
The people who
started the Klan

01:11:40.142 --> 01:11:42.438
may have had good
intention at first

01:11:42.479 --> 01:11:46.695
but now, I'm sure Apollo has
told you what he's heard.

01:11:48.281 --> 01:11:51.829
What I've heard and
seen has been terrible.

01:11:53.415 --> 01:11:55.878
Nathan, you're a powerful man.

01:11:55.919 --> 01:11:57.422
But I also think
you're a good man.

01:11:58.966 --> 01:12:00.803
You know I was against the war.

01:12:00.845 --> 01:12:02.472
But I think you'll
go down in history

01:12:02.514 --> 01:12:04.016
as a great warrior general.

01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:08.692
But being in the Klan
will ruin your name.

01:12:09.609 --> 01:12:11.321
You know what you need to do.

01:12:12.532 --> 01:12:14.576
If you can't stop
what they're doing,

01:12:14.619 --> 01:12:16.748
you need to get out
as soon as possible.

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:20.879
And you go tell Mary Ann
you're ready to get baptized.

01:13:13.627 --> 01:13:18.627
