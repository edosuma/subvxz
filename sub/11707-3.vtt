27:16.968 --> 27:18.803
{\an1}- You made that up.
- Isn't that embarrassing?

27:18.887 --> 27:20.889
{\an1}- I know it's embarrassing.
- How cute is she?

27:20.972 --> 27:24.059
{\an1}If I saw you in a bar
and I wanted to be les-bionic

27:24.142 --> 27:24.809
I'd make out with you.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.562
You guys are too nice! Damn!

27:27.645 --> 27:28.980
No, I'm not nice at all.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.357
{\an1}- No...
- But I'm being honest.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.733
{\an8}[laughs]

27:31.816 --> 27:34.736
{\an7}I wouldn't say I'm a lesbian,
but I guess bi-curious.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.321
{\an8}I don't think
I'd ever date a girl

27:36.404 --> 27:37.155
{\an8}'cause I really,
really love penis.

27:37.238 --> 27:39.366
{\an8}But I have fun.

27:39.449 --> 27:42.535
- Let's go play.
- Where, where at?

27:42.619 --> 27:44.371
- In the room.
- Let's go.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.126
Just lay down. Please?

27:50.210 --> 27:51.753
- I have to pee.
- I have to pee too.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.880
{\an1}- Go pee first, then I'll go.
- Okay.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.298
{\an1}- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.050
Stay there this is my bed.

27:58.676 --> 28:00.720
- Where's your girl?
- Right here.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.389
{\an1}In my room,
and I'm making out with her.

28:02.472 --> 28:03.765
{\an1}- Just left her in your room?
- Yeah.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.476
{\an1}I mean,
I'll bring her out with you.

28:06.559 --> 28:09.145
I don't feel
like...conversating.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.449
About a couple months ago.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.661
Him and Snook...

28:25.286 --> 28:27.622
You serious?

28:29.624 --> 28:32.168
{\an1}That she cheated on him,
on Jionni.

28:34.045 --> 28:37.006
{\an7}And he specifically said
that she cheated.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.676
Specifically said like...

28:39.759 --> 28:43.054
{\an1}I'm gonna tell you something.
Nobody knows about this.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.682
And you can't
tell it to anybody.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.225
Me and Snooki

28:47.308 --> 28:50.603
we...we kinda hooked up.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.940
{\an7}<i>(Ronnie)</i>
<i>I [bleep] told on Mike. Yeah.</i>

28:54.023 --> 28:56.067
{\an8}Mike ratted me out
in [bleep] Miami.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.694
{\an8}Mike ratted me out
in [bleep] Jersey.

28:57.777 --> 28:58.445
{\an7}So what guy code is there
between me and Mike?

28:58.528 --> 29:00.738
{\an8}There is no guy code.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.575
{\an1}- You should tell Nicole.
- It's disgusting.

29:03.658 --> 29:05.368
I'm gonna tell her right now.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.078
[exhales]

29:07.162 --> 29:10.623
I'm disappointed kind of
a little bit in Deena.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.959
- I don't know.
- Why?

29:13.042 --> 29:14.335
I don't know, because like

29:14.419 --> 29:16.129
when I wanted to go
hook up with a girl

29:16.212 --> 29:17.297
she went, whoosh!

29:17.380 --> 29:19.174
I'm like, wow. She's like...

29:19.257 --> 29:20.341
I think she's like...

29:20.425 --> 29:23.011
...selfish. Ha ha.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.512
What's everybody eating?

29:24.596 --> 29:26.181
{\an1}Go over there
and get a little plate.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.853
Aah! I can't do it.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.734
{\an1}What if I started making out
with you r-right now?

29:37.817 --> 29:40.236
What would I think?
I don't know.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.529
{\an5}<i>(Vinny)</i>
<i>I thought she was</i>
<i>gonna get with Mike.</i>

29:41.613 --> 29:43.364
{\an7}<i>I thought she was</i>
<i>gonna get with Deena.</i>

29:43.448 --> 29:44.782
{\an7}I don't know who
this girl's gonna get with

29:44.866 --> 29:47.118
{\an7}but somehow,
she ends up on top of me.

29:52.832 --> 29:54.834
{\an1}- Do you wanna go to sleep now?
- Yeah.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.219
What the hell?

30:08.473 --> 30:09.933
What the hell?

30:10.016 --> 30:13.061
{\an7}I was hooking up with
this girl the entire night.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.230
{\an8}<i>I brought her home, okay?</i>

30:15.313 --> 30:17.524
{\an7}<i>knowing I was hooking up</i>
<i>with this girl the entire night</i>

30:17.607 --> 30:19.400
{\an7}<i>Vinny decides</i>
<i>to hook up with this girl.</i>

30:19.484 --> 30:21.736
{\an7}So I said, no,
she's coming into my bed.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.784
{\an8}Deena did hook up
with this girl first

30:27.867 --> 30:28.618
{\an8}<i>but the girl was in my bed</i>

30:28.701 --> 30:31.120
{\an8}<i>and I was mid-hookup with her.</i>

30:33.665 --> 30:34.832
{\an8}<i>Even if I pulled a robbery</i>

30:34.916 --> 30:35.583
{\an8}you don't pull
the double robbery

30:35.667 --> 30:37.627
{\an8}you know what I mean?

30:44.759 --> 30:45.927
- 'Oh!'
- Are you okay?

30:50.890 --> 30:53.142
{\an8}Deena's [bleep]
blocked me before

30:53.226 --> 30:55.812
{\an7}<i>but never took the girl</i>
<i>and hooked up with her herself.</i>

31:00.858 --> 31:03.611
{\an1}So you gonna smash
this chick tonight, or...

31:03.695 --> 31:05.655
I don't know. I don't know.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.532
{\an1}Might as well.
She's in your bed.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.784
But like, I didn't
wanna bring her home

31:09.867 --> 31:13.204
{\an1}because like I'm the type
of person that's like

31:13.288 --> 31:14.497
{\an1}I'm not gonna cross you,
you know what I mean?

31:14.581 --> 31:17.792
{\an1}Hey, can I talk to Nicole
for a second by myself?

31:17.875 --> 31:19.627
{\an1}There's an emergency.
I just need to talk to Nicole.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.005
{\an1}What? What do you mean,
emergency?

31:22.088 --> 31:23.298
Don't say that.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.594
You're scaring me.

31:28.595 --> 31:32.056
{\an1}Mike told people
about what you guys did.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.308
{\an3}Everyone.

31:33.391 --> 31:36.144
- We didn't do anything.
- No. He told everyone.

31:38.313 --> 31:41.566
{\an1}- Everyone.
- We didn't do anything.

31:41.649 --> 31:42.942
{\an1}<i>(Snooki)</i>
<i>I was so [bleep] pissed off</i>

31:43.026 --> 31:44.902
{\an7}because I thought I could
trust everybody in the house

31:44.986 --> 31:46.821
{\an7}so what the hell
is going on right now?

31:46.904 --> 31:49.324
He gave all your details.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.785
{\an1}- What [bleep] details?
- He gave details.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.495
He's psycho!

31:55.622 --> 31:56.873
{\an1}But it's not
like details of like

31:56.956 --> 31:58.333
{\an7}"Oh, we hooked up
a couple months ago."

31:58.416 --> 32:02.045
{\an1}There was details that say,
"I [bleep] Nicole

32:02.128 --> 32:05.089
and she cheated on Jionni."

32:06.424 --> 32:07.675
{\an1}Oh!

32:07.759 --> 32:09.677
I'm gonna cry right now. No.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.847
Handle that. That's your boy.

32:12.930 --> 32:14.766
{\an8}Mike is a big fat liar.

32:14.849 --> 32:16.643
{\an8}I have never
hooked up with him.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.978
{\an7}And the fact that I was there
for him as a friend

32:19.062 --> 32:20.688
{\an7}I mean, you're a [bleep]
ass[bleep].

32:20.772 --> 32:22.231
Dude!

32:22.315 --> 32:23.316
(Snooki)
'[bleep] Mike!'

32:23.399 --> 32:26.486
{\an1}- 'What?'
- What is wrong with you?

32:26.569 --> 32:28.321
{\an1}- What is wrong with you?
- Come here...

32:28.404 --> 32:29.364
{\an1}- No! I'm not gonna come here.
- What?

32:29.447 --> 32:31.366
{\an1}- [bleep] stay right here.
- 'What?'

32:31.449 --> 32:33.826
You're telling everybody that
I cheated on Jionni with you.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.828
Why would you even say that?

32:35.912 --> 32:37.038
{\an1}Where did you...
Where-who came up with this?

32:37.121 --> 32:40.541
{\an1}I am...
I am [bleep] friends with you.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.085
{\an1}You're telling
everybody in the house!

32:42.168 --> 32:43.211
{\an1}- No, I didn't tell anybody.
- Yes, you did.

32:43.294 --> 32:45.838
Because everyone's
telling me right now.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.298
{\an1}No, no, I didn't tell
everybody in the house.

32:47.382 --> 32:50.051
Okay, well, obviously
you're lying right now

32:50.134 --> 32:52.720
{\an1}because you know how [bleep]
much I love Jionni.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.180
I'm not [bleep]
dealing with that [bleep].

32:54.263 --> 32:56.099
{\an1}'That's done. I don't
wanna be friends with you.'

32:56.182 --> 32:58.643
{\an1}I don't like you. I can't
even look at you right now.

32:58.726 --> 32:59.894
{\an1}Done.

33:06.192 --> 33:07.193
{\an8}I'm a little disappointed
that you told everybody.

33:07.276 --> 33:09.404
{\an8}You better shut
your [bleep] mouth.

33:09.487 --> 33:10.613
{\an8}You're a [bleep] snitch.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.323
{\an8}This is all [bleep] up.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.659
{\an8}I swear to God, if I lose
Jionni over this [bleep]

33:14.742 --> 33:15.910
{\an8}I am killing Mike.

33:23.334 --> 33:24.585
{\an1}(Snooki)
'I want nothing to do with you.'

33:24.669 --> 33:27.296
I was your [bleep] friend
in the house and I'm done.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.466
{\an1}- I'm not gonna lie.
- You're a [bleep] ass[bleep].

33:30.550 --> 33:32.844
{\an7}Everybody knows
The Situation is not a liar

33:32.927 --> 33:34.178
{\an8}and The Situation is,
if a girl rejects me

33:34.262 --> 33:36.931
{\an7}I'll say it, you know?
I've never lied.

33:37.014 --> 33:38.599
{\an1}- I'm not gonna lie.
- 'Mike, get over it.'

33:38.683 --> 33:40.101
- 'I'm not gonna lie.'
- 'Nothing happened.'

33:40.184 --> 33:41.352
I'm not gonna lie.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.731
{\an7}You are lying about me
hooking up recently with you.

33:44.814 --> 33:46.399
We hooked up two months ago.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.776
- You're a psycho!
- Two months ago.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.611
{\an1}- You're [bleep] psycho.
- Two months ago.

33:50.695 --> 33:51.779
- Get over it.
- I'm not gonna lie.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.448
- Nothing happened.
- I'm not gonna lie.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.033
{\an1}No, you're an ass[bleep],
because the only person

33:56.117 --> 33:59.203
that's your friend and talk
to you in the house, is me.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.330
{\an1}And you are
a [bleep] ass[bleep].

34:01.414 --> 34:03.708
{\an1}Dude, you have
no friends in the house.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.418
{\an1}Mike,
you're a [bleep] douche bag

34:05.501 --> 34:08.254
{\an1}and I [bleep] hate you.
I [bleep] hate you.

34:08.337 --> 34:09.088
{\an8}For once, no drama with me

34:09.172 --> 34:11.090
{\an8}and it feels [bleep] amazing.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.300
{\an1}You know how much
I [bleep] love Jionni

34:12.382 --> 34:14.135
{\an1}and the fact that you would
say something like that.

34:14.217 --> 34:17.179
You are a [bleep].
I don't like you.

34:17.263 --> 34:18.764
{\an1}- 'I didn't lie.'
- This is [bleep] embarrassing.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.141
{\an1}- This was two months ago.
- 'No, no.'

34:20.224 --> 34:21.559
{\an1}- This was two months ago.
- Mike.

34:21.641 --> 34:22.976
- 'Two months ago.'
- Seriously.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.937
{\an8}I haven't seen Mike
in two months.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.355
{\an7}I don't know what the
[bleep] he's talking about.

34:26.438 --> 34:27.815
{\an1}- 'I don't lie.'
- Don't [bleep] talk to me.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.942
Listen, listen, listen.

34:30.025 --> 34:31.110
I don't lie.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.362
Everybody in this house
knows I don't lie, okay?

34:33.446 --> 34:34.489
- Ron, really?
- I don't lie.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.283
{\an7}Nicole's flipping out
on Mike right now

34:37.366 --> 34:39.659
{\an1}<i>saying that it's not true,</i>
<i>and it's like it's kinda good</i>

34:39.744 --> 34:41.161
{\an8}because I wanna know
if it's true or not.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.205
{\an8}I wanna know if Mike's lying

34:42.288 --> 34:43.371
{\an8}or if Mike's telling the truth.

34:43.456 --> 34:44.498
I swear on anything
in this world.

34:44.581 --> 34:47.585
{\an1}Dude, I'm alone once again.
Thank you.

34:47.668 --> 34:50.004
Okay. The reason why you're
walking away is because...

34:50.087 --> 34:52.672
{\an1}No, because you're [bleep].
You're [bleep] psycho!

34:52.757 --> 34:53.882
{\an7}This crossed the line,
like I always say

34:53.966 --> 34:56.177
{\an8}if you [bleep] with my friends

34:56.260 --> 34:56.844
{\an7}<i>me and my relationship</i>
<i>with my boyfriend</i>

34:56.928 --> 34:58.346
{\an8}or my family, it's done.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.348
{\an1}Listen, do you want me to
describe exactly what happened?

35:00.431 --> 35:03.100
{\an1}- [bleep] you, Mike!
- Do you want me to describe?

35:03.184 --> 35:04.477
What exactly happened?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.687
{\an1}You're such
a [bleep] ass[bleep].

35:06.771 --> 35:07.730
I cannot...

35:07.814 --> 35:09.273
[grunts]

35:15.696 --> 35:18.741
{\an7}So I'm hooking up with Erica,
and I'm into it having a blast.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.326
Hey, put those on.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.914
{\an7}Then I get freaked out.
This is not me.

35:24.997 --> 35:25.748
{\an8}<i>This is not what I do.</i>

35:25.832 --> 35:27.291
{\an8}I like penis.

35:29.126 --> 35:30.294
{\an8}<i>So I was like, whatever.</i>

35:30.378 --> 35:32.713
{\an7}Erica, go on, you can
go into Vinny's bed now.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.173
{\an8}So she wound up ending
the night with Vinny.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.262
{\an8}'Oh, man!'

35:47.645 --> 35:49.522
Why would he do that to me?

35:51.732 --> 35:53.985
You want my advice, Snook?

35:54.068 --> 35:55.444
If it's true?

35:55.987 --> 35:57.864
It's not true.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.032
{\an1}If, if I'm,
I'm not accusing anybody.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.909
{\an1}I will tell you
what the [bleep] happened.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.369
{\an1}- Okay.
- Not even two months ago.

36:03.452 --> 36:05.746
{\an1}- [bleep] a while back ago.
- Yeah.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.915
{\an1}He was with Unit,
and you know how Unit is.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.876
Ryder and Unit got together.

36:09.959 --> 36:12.128
{\an1}Mike wanted to hook up with me,
and I said no.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.254
{\an8}He got [bleep] pissed off

36:13.337 --> 36:15.006
{\an1}and he went outside
on the balcony.

36:15.089 --> 36:16.382
'Cause I wouldn't
hook up with him.

36:16.465 --> 36:17.800
{\an8}And that's it.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.927
{\an7}Snooki may have cheated.
You don't know who to believe.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.596
{\an8}It's like Snooki's gonna say no

36:21.679 --> 36:23.514
{\an7}because she doesn't wanna
lose her boyfriend

36:23.598 --> 36:24.765
{\an8}and then Mike's gonna say yes

36:24.849 --> 36:26.309
{\an7}'cause he doesn't wanna
look like a liar.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.436
{\an7}The only two people that know
were the people that were there.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.898
{\an1}I don't, like,
you know what happened but--

36:33.232 --> 36:35.109
{\an1}- I just told you what happened.
- I know.

36:35.192 --> 36:36.819
For Jionni's sake

36:36.903 --> 36:38.404
what you do is woman up.

36:38.487 --> 36:41.449
{\an1}Tell him the whole [bleep]
scenario that happened

36:41.532 --> 36:45.745
{\an1}and it's better to hear it
from you believe me. Look at me.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.330
{\an1}Than find out
like the way I did.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.290
{\an1}- 'Dude, he's such a [bleep].'
- You know why?

36:49.373 --> 36:51.459
Because finding out this way

36:51.542 --> 36:55.046
{\an1}is gonna [bleep] with you
so much longer in the long run.

36:55.129 --> 36:57.048
I didn't do anything wrong
for me to be [bleep].

36:57.131 --> 36:59.634
{\an1}So then tell Jionni.
Tell him the [bleep] scenario.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.929
I, I don't understand
why Mike would do that.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.847
Now it's done. Done.

37:08.392 --> 37:10.353
{\an1}- 'You know I don't lie.'
- I cannot...

37:10.436 --> 37:11.395
[grunts]

37:14.231 --> 37:16.233
{\an1}You know, I don't lie,
and I'm a little disappointed

37:16.317 --> 37:18.152
{\an1}that you told people,
I'm a little disappointed

37:18.235 --> 37:20.905
{\an1}I asked for your,
I asked for your opinion.

37:20.988 --> 37:22.531
{\an7}Listen, you better
shut your [bleep] mouth

37:22.615 --> 37:24.116
{\an8}<i>'cause you're a [bleep] snitch.</i>

37:24.200 --> 37:25.910
{\an7}<i>Like how many times have</i>
<i>you [bleep] caused trouble</i>

37:25.993 --> 37:27.328
{\an7}with me
and my [bleep] girlfriend

37:27.411 --> 37:29.330
{\an7}and sat back and just
[bleep] sparked a fuse?

37:29.413 --> 37:34.043
{\an1}I told Jenni what you
told me and I feel like

37:34.126 --> 37:36.504
you, you know, you know
that it was gonna come out

37:36.587 --> 37:39.507
{\an1}no matter what, you know
that it was gonna come out.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.008
{\an7}<i>(Mike)</i>
<i>Uh, I told Ronnie in confidence</i>

37:41.092 --> 37:42.969
{\an7}and all of a sudden,
he immediately tells Jenni

37:43.052 --> 37:44.637
{\an8}when he's drunk?

37:44.720 --> 37:46.305
{\an8}Like, it's not cool.

37:46.389 --> 37:49.016
{\an7}<i>I entrusted you</i>
<i>with a huge, huge secret.</i>

37:49.100 --> 37:50.268
{\an1}- You knew I was sincere.
- I'm not saying you aren't.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.894
But you bringing home
different girls

37:51.978 --> 37:54.230
is not being sincere.

37:54.313 --> 37:56.482
{\an1}B-but this-t
what happened with me and her

37:56.565 --> 37:59.068
{\an1}was two months ago,
you know I don't lie...

38:00.111 --> 38:01.362
I-I didn't say you lied.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.446
{\an1}I didn't sit there and say
you [bleep] lied, bro.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.198
{\an1}- I-I...
- I didn't say you [bleep].

38:04.281 --> 38:06.117
{\an1}I'm a little
disappointed in you.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.369
{\an4}<i>(Ronnie)</i>
<i>With Mike, you never know</i>
<i>what his intentions are.</i>

38:08.452 --> 38:10.621
{\an7}<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if what he's saying is true</i>

38:10.705 --> 38:13.165
{\an8}or if he's just trying
to be the instigator.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.835
{\an7}- What, you didn't believe me?
- I didn't say, no, no.

38:15.918 --> 38:17.545
{\an1}- Did I say that?
- Did you guys not believe me?

38:17.628 --> 38:20.172
{\an1}- No, no, no.
- I said, I believe you.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.174
{\an1}- 'By telling Ronnie--'
- Where is everybody?

38:22.258 --> 38:24.802
{\an1}Me and her, we-we're close,
you know what I mean?

38:24.885 --> 38:26.345
{\an1}Oh, my God, now I have
this chick running around.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.264
Get them out of here.
Just get rid of them.

38:28.347 --> 38:30.558
'Cause we gotta deal
with this [bleep].

38:30.641 --> 38:33.310
{\an1}- Just, just--
- Just come and hold me.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.563
{\an1}- Just lay down, just lay down.
- They need to get out.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.023
Lay down...

38:38.566 --> 38:40.526
{\an1}<i>(Mike)</i>
<i>It's called guilty conscience</i>

38:40.609 --> 38:41.193
{\an8}so we're gonna see
what Snooki does.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.154
{\an8}The truth will come out.

38:43.237 --> 38:44.363
{\an7}The truth will set you free,
Snooki.

38:47.366 --> 38:48.993
This is all [bleep] up.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.536
This [bleep] is not gonna
ruin what I have.

38:50.619 --> 38:53.789
Look at me. You did nothing
wrong. We're gonna fix this.

38:53.873 --> 38:56.375
{\an4}<i>(Jenni)</i>
<i>I call bull[bleep].</i>
<i>I see through your game.</i>

38:56.459 --> 38:58.878
{\an7}It's not gonna work.
Nicole loves Jionni. Move on.

38:58.961 --> 39:01.255
I swear to God, if I lose
Jionni over this [bleep]

39:01.338 --> 39:03.090
I am killing Mike.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.426
You're not.
Jionni loves you too much.

39:05.509 --> 39:08.429
{\an1}Listen, no offense to Jionni,
but if he wants to take his word

39:08.512 --> 39:10.598
over yours,
then let Jionni walk.

39:10.681 --> 39:13.100
But I know Jionni better than
that, and he's not going to.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.519
Jionni loves you.

39:15.603 --> 39:16.896
You'll be okay.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.985
And listen, no offense,
Jionni will not leave you

39:23.069 --> 39:24.320
over Mike
[bleep] talking [bleep].

39:24.403 --> 39:25.821
Mike's talking [bleep].

39:25.905 --> 39:28.783
But he's such a douche bag.
Why would he do that to me?

39:28.866 --> 39:31.827
