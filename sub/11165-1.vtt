01:59.164 --> 02:04.436
John Johnson, report
to Edgemar Station in dress uniform.

02:04.436 --> 02:07.666
Lucky you.
You're about to make history.

02:24.389 --> 02:28.527
Hey, Can't you read?
It says "Employees only,"

02:28.527 --> 02:31.427
- I am an employee,
- No, it don't mean trustees,

02:34.600 --> 02:37.135
Your lives are at stake,
so pay attention.

02:37.135 --> 02:40.439
Your number-one responsibility
out there is to stay alive

02:40.439 --> 02:42.975
and protect the lives of your partners,

02:42.975 --> 02:44.276
Now, on a brighter note,

02:44.276 --> 02:47.179
Bush has decided to finally
get rid of that rice-burnin' piece of crap

02:47.179 --> 02:48.413
and ride American,

02:48.413 --> 02:51.083
Thank you, Chuck,
Good morning, gentlemen,

02:51.083 --> 02:56.021
I'd like to introduce to you John Johnson,
fresh out of the academy,

02:56.021 --> 02:58.724
and he's been assigned to,
uh, to join us,

02:58.724 --> 03:00.292
- Meet some of the boys,
- OK,

03:00.292 --> 03:02.521
- Deputy Bono,
- Hey,

03:03.795 --> 03:06.231
- Jim Ryan, Pleasure,
- Jim, how ya doin'? Good to meet you,

03:06.231 --> 03:08.967
- Smith, Deputy Bush,
- Yeah, we met in the parking lot,

03:08.967 --> 03:11.937
- Right,
- Detective Baker back here, my right arm,

03:11.937 --> 03:15.040
- Just call me Gene, I've gotta roll,
- Gene, good to meet you,

03:15.040 --> 03:18.977
- Chuck, This is Chuck Gilmore,
- Hey, Chuck,

03:18.977 --> 03:22.547
He's been assigned to show you the ropes,
so to speak, You'll ride with him,

03:22.547 --> 03:25.183
- OK,
- Bring your Dramamine, kid,

03:25.183 --> 03:27.819
These guys are all workin' overtime
just to keep up,

03:27.819 --> 03:30.822
- Huh, Do you two know each other?
- No,

03:30.822 --> 03:32.824
- I'm Foster,
- John Johnson,

03:32.824 --> 03:34.726
- Nice to meet you, Welcome aboard,
- Thanks, Good to be here,

03:34.726 --> 03:40.232
Look, Larry, it isn't going to work,
You know we don't have the money,

03:40.232 --> 03:43.702
- Officer Deborah Fields,
- John Johnson, Good to meet you,

03:43.702 --> 03:45.570
- How you doin'?
- I'm all right,

03:45.570 --> 03:46.538
Bye,

03:46.538 --> 03:49.802
I don't know what to say
except, um,

03:51.376 --> 03:54.046
this is your job, not mine,

03:54.046 --> 03:57.416
- I suggest you come up with some ideas,
- We'll see ya,

03:57.416 --> 03:59.551
- Good luck,
- OK,

03:59.551 --> 04:01.541
Thanks a lot,

04:02.954 --> 04:05.957
- Well...
- Well...

04:05.957 --> 04:08.550
- Good, Thanks a lot,
- Thank you,

04:36.088 --> 04:38.990
Did you know you were traveling
well over the speed limit, ma'am?

04:38.990 --> 04:43.221
Officer, my speedometer's broken,
I had no idea how fast I was going,

04:45.697 --> 04:48.900
And besides,
what's a handsome man like you doing

04:48.900 --> 04:52.232
hiding in bushes,
trying to trap single young women?

04:55.540 --> 04:58.474
Well, ma'am,
it's times like these, I hate who I am,

05:01.980 --> 05:05.244
You have a nice day, ma'am,
Drive safely,

05:13.191 --> 05:15.861
Ohh, Mmm!

05:15.861 --> 05:21.233
- Why didn't you write her?
- Oh, man, she was, she was nice,

05:21.233 --> 05:23.135
"Nice," Get in,

05:23.135 --> 05:24.402
Huh?

05:24.402 --> 05:26.995
Get in the car! Now!

05:49.828 --> 05:52.057
Back me up,

05:58.203 --> 06:01.660
Keep both of your hands
on the wheel, ma'am,

06:06.478 --> 06:09.537
License and registration, please,

06:13.618 --> 06:16.017
She will be late for work now,

06:45.317 --> 06:47.978
Stay in your car, lady,

07:07.405 --> 07:10.175
I guess this makes you feel
like a big man,

07:10.175 --> 07:13.735
Press firmly,
There's three copies, ma'am,

07:17.048 --> 07:19.914
- You have a nice day,
- Yeah, right,

07:25.223 --> 07:28.126
They can be ugly as sin
or they can look like Miss America,

07:28.126 --> 07:32.464
In this station, once you stop 'em,
you write 'em or you cuff 'em,

07:32.464 --> 07:34.532
Leave your hormones
out of it, young blood,

07:34.532 --> 07:36.768
'cause while you're daydreamin'
about some good-Iookin' skirt,

07:36.768 --> 07:39.404
you will get your head blown off,

07:39.404 --> 07:41.564
Don't trust anybody,

07:45.810 --> 07:48.213
We're here bridging two communities
with common troubles,

07:48.213 --> 07:51.049
Now, in both cases,
there have been coroner findings

07:51.049 --> 07:54.052
that absolutely contradict
the sheriff's report,

07:54.052 --> 07:57.822
All these young men
who died while in police custody

07:57.822 --> 07:59.812
had no prior criminal records,

08:00.392 --> 08:05.163
And this kind of police policy
says a lot about these times,

08:05.163 --> 08:08.333
Now I'd like for
Mr, and Mrs, Ernie Marshall,

08:08.333 --> 08:12.637
whose son died while in custody
inside the sheriff's station,

08:12.637 --> 08:14.572
to talk to you,

08:14.572 --> 08:18.710
Why do you persist in this when there was
not enough evidence to bring charges?

08:18.710 --> 08:21.146
I'm going by physical evidence,

08:21.146 --> 08:24.849
The coroner's report said that
my son died at the hands of another,

08:24.849 --> 08:27.719
Surely that means
he did not hang himself,

08:27.719 --> 08:30.983
Easy, sister, It's all right,

08:37.629 --> 08:41.433
- I'm gonna go check on the neighborhood,
- All right,

08:41.433 --> 08:45.960
J.J., get rid of that piece of junk
and get you a real car,

08:46.905 --> 08:49.874
I'm tired of this,
I can't keep doin' this every morning,

08:49.874 --> 08:51.376
- Yeah?
- Yeah,

08:51.376 --> 08:53.378
- But you will,
- I will?

08:53.378 --> 08:55.607
- Mm-hm,
- And why is that?

08:56.614 --> 08:59.351
- 'Cause you love me, baby,
- I do love you,

08:59.351 --> 09:01.219
- Mm-hm,
- Mm-hm,

09:01.219 --> 09:04.022
- Bye, I'll see you later,
- OK,

09:04.022 --> 09:07.058
- Have a good one,
- All right,

09:07.058 --> 09:10.083
But you gonna find out just how much
I love you tomorrow morning,

09:19.471 --> 09:23.208
Deputy, I hope you're more alert
when you're out in the field,

09:23.208 --> 09:26.878
Uh, I'm sorry, sir,
I was, I was reading this book,

09:26.878 --> 09:30.015
One would think you're reading
Gone with the Wind.

09:30.015 --> 09:32.350
No, No, no,
It's the code book, sir,

09:32.350 --> 09:34.152
It's still fiction,

09:34.152 --> 09:38.890
- Did you fill out this arrest report?
- Yes, sir,

09:38.890 --> 09:42.827
Well, I've seen three-year-olds that
spell and use grammar better than that,

09:42.827 --> 09:46.398
That document may have to be
used in a court of law,

09:46.398 --> 09:49.834
One little error,
and criminals can walk,

09:49.834 --> 09:54.361
So, Mr, Johnson,
will you get it right?

09:54.973 --> 09:57.442
Excuse me, sir,
What words did I misspell?

09:57.442 --> 10:00.445
"Sepulveda," Here,

10:00.445 --> 10:02.280
Now, what's the subject
of this sentence?

10:02.280 --> 10:06.451
"Group" is the subject, not "people,"
so the verb is "is,"

10:06.451 --> 10:12.590
Intelligent people will be looking
at that report somewhere down the line,

10:12.590 --> 10:14.580
Yes, sir,

10:17.829 --> 10:19.130
- Sir,
- Oh, Deputy Fields,

10:19.130 --> 10:20.265
I've been meaning to talk to you,

10:20.265 --> 10:26.294
Some of the men are complaining
about your heavy use of perfume,

10:27.338 --> 10:30.909
Well, sir, I will lower my voice
and start wearin' Old Spice

10:30.909 --> 10:33.344
- if it makes those men happy,
- Oh,

10:33.344 --> 10:37.816
It's not a question of a leopard
changing his spots,

10:37.816 --> 10:39.617
It's the animal,

10:39.617 --> 10:44.519
People,
people have to, fit in,

10:47.725 --> 10:49.715
Sir,

10:55.400 --> 10:57.959
- Morning, Trooper,
- Hi,

11:02.640 --> 11:06.973
I see that Massey's got someone else
to pick on for a while,

11:08.012 --> 11:12.283
I'm their first female deputy,
and besides trustees,

11:12.283 --> 11:14.786
you're the only black face around,

11:14.786 --> 11:17.777
I was picked by
the Commissioner's Office,

11:20.258 --> 11:24.129
Look, Trooper,
we were both picked for our jobs,

11:24.129 --> 11:26.564
That and a dollar will get you on the bus,

11:26.564 --> 11:28.867
Uh-oh,

11:28.867 --> 11:30.857
What sign are you?

11:34.539 --> 11:37.142
12-Adam- 131, possible 211 burglary

11:37.142 --> 11:39.811
at warehouse
at 5-2-0-0 Wood Avenue.

11:39.811 --> 11:42.608
12-Adam-131, we're rolling,

11:44.015 --> 11:46.175
Here we go, kid,

11:55.460 --> 11:58.663
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Gettin' ready,

13:00.225 --> 13:03.361
No! Hey! Hey!

13:06.965 --> 13:09.467
Get off! Don't! Argh!

13:09.467 --> 13:11.297
Get him off me!

13:12.971 --> 13:14.839
Get him!

13:14.839 --> 13:17.534
Hold him down!

13:19.811 --> 13:22.244
Freeze!

13:24.582 --> 13:27.518
Are you coverin' the back, mister?

13:47.772 --> 13:49.762
Massey wants you,

13:54.712 --> 13:57.982
Who's ahead?
Certainly not you, Jesse,

14:07.625 --> 14:10.957
Deputy, you endangered the lives
of your fellow officers,

14:12.864 --> 14:15.500
You were assigned to
watch the back of a building,

14:15.500 --> 14:17.602
There was a burglary in progress,

14:17.602 --> 14:19.404
I thought we had
captured the suspect,

14:19.404 --> 14:22.373
Did it occur to you
there might be another suspect?

14:22.373 --> 14:23.508
It occurred to me, yes,

14:23.508 --> 14:28.212
Did it occur to you that that suspect
may have been carrying a gun?

14:28.212 --> 14:32.483
We just can't seem to get people
around here to do their job,

14:32.483 --> 14:36.654
Now, if criminals don't fear God,
they will this badge and this division,

14:36.654 --> 14:39.157
- Now, do you want to be part of this force?
- Yes, sir,

14:39.157 --> 14:43.928
All right! Your job won't make you soft,
it will harden you to the facts of our time,

14:43.928 --> 14:47.328
And when you're on backup,
you back up, sir!

14:50.268 --> 14:51.700
Yes, sir,

15:03.581 --> 15:06.718
So, Mr, Johnson,
you still wanna be a peace officer?

15:06.718 --> 15:09.087
Well, where else can I
make this kind of money, hm?

15:09.087 --> 15:11.923
You could... sell junk bonds,

15:14.692 --> 15:17.628
I thought this was supposed
to be a man's job,

15:17.628 --> 15:20.231
Well, Trooper, you'd better
turn your shield in, then,

15:20.231 --> 15:23.134
Or am I talkin' to the future sheriff
in these here parts?

15:23.134 --> 15:26.037
They're gonna name this station
after me one day,

15:26.037 --> 15:28.339
I'm sorry,

15:28.339 --> 15:30.329
What?

15:31.943 --> 15:35.708
- You can't be married,
- Look who is calling the pot black,

15:42.553 --> 15:48.252
You know, you'd better lay off
the steak and doughnuts... honey,

15:50.094 --> 15:52.764
- Good morning, everybody, Frank,
- Hey, how's it going, James?

15:52.764 --> 15:57.034
- Rev, how you doin'? I'm sorry I'm late,
- James Locket, what kept you?

15:57.034 --> 16:01.672
Let me tell you something, Rev,
Saving souls is a lot less time-consuming

16:01.672 --> 16:03.307
than defending the innocent,

16:03.307 --> 16:06.711
- All you gotta do is pray,
- But you get the guilty off too,

16:06.711 --> 16:10.081
- They're easier to get off,
- Well, speaking of the guilty,

16:10.081 --> 16:13.084
Ms, Marshall tells me the sheriff's
department is still following her,

16:13.084 --> 16:15.086
- The sheriff's harassing you?
- Mm-hm,

16:15.086 --> 16:18.577
Every day,
They won't leave us alone,

16:20.458 --> 16:22.391
Hey,

16:25.696 --> 16:28.027
Anything I can help you with?

16:31.135 --> 16:35.306
- I got the results of the tests back,
- And?

16:35.306 --> 16:38.399
They want me to start the treatments again,

16:39.410 --> 16:41.746
Get another opinion,

16:41.746 --> 16:46.682
This time the cancer's in my liver,
my back - it's everywhere,

16:50.621 --> 16:54.556
I need to leave
the wife and kids somethin',

17:08.105 --> 17:09.906
- Oh-ho!
- Hey, baby,

17:09.906 --> 17:12.742
Hey, sweetie, how ya doin'?
Wanna see my night stick, huh?

17:12.742 --> 17:15.012
What do ya think?
Yeah, I'd like to get busted by that,

17:15.012 --> 17:20.540
Any unit, man down.
Possible homicide at 2-4-0- 1 West 125th.

18:11.269 --> 18:12.770
What you got?

18:12.770 --> 18:15.907
Well, he says he was stopped
in the intersection,

18:15.907 --> 18:19.877
Two blacks got out of their car,
pulled a gun and asked for money,

18:19.877 --> 18:23.247
When Mr, Greenspan there
said all he had was credit cards,

18:23.247 --> 18:27.910
the man standing near his window
fired and killed his wife,

18:45.403 --> 18:49.240
Let's get another unit
down to the north end,

18:49.240 --> 18:51.230
Let's get a lineup,

18:54.879 --> 18:56.641
Get the other streets blocked off,

18:57.315 --> 19:00.151
It looks like they used a nine-millimeter,

19:00.151 --> 19:05.389
- I didn't find any casings,
-  No witnesses,

19:05.389 --> 19:10.291
And I'm sure you'll notice that
the shot came from down below,

19:15.866 --> 19:18.302
Come here,

19:18.302 --> 19:20.271
Save your judgments
for when you make detective,

19:20.271 --> 19:23.040
In the meantime,
just keep the traffic flowing,

19:23.040 --> 19:25.409
Sir,

19:25.409 --> 19:28.479
I was the second officer
on the scene,

19:28.479 --> 19:32.249
I'm sure I can be
of some assistance,

19:32.249 --> 19:34.852
We don't need a Jewish mother
tellin' us how to do our job,

19:34.852 --> 19:37.183
so you just move on,

19:41.092 --> 19:42.627
- Bush!
- Yes, sir?

19:42.627 --> 19:45.686
- You the first officer on the scene?
- Yes, sir,

19:54.839 --> 19:58.976
Ma'am, do you know what's going on in
your sheriff's department? This will tell you,

19:58.976 --> 20:01.312
- Ma'am, would you like to know,
- No, I don't have time,

20:01.312 --> 20:03.748
As you know, the Attorney General's Office
did not agree with

20:03.748 --> 20:06.250
the findings of
the Internal Affairs Commission

20:06.250 --> 20:08.052
regarding charges against this station,

20:08.052 --> 20:11.789
So I'm happy to report that
the four detectives who were on leave

20:11.789 --> 20:14.018
are now back on the force,

20:19.463 --> 20:24.035
Many of you also know two officers
in the city are being sued for $ 7 million

20:24.035 --> 20:26.901
for wrongful death,

20:27.972 --> 20:31.575
The city council is cracking down,

20:31.575 --> 20:34.509
Budgetary reasons,
They wanna take our bullets away,

20:35.413 --> 20:39.417
And as for Officer Collins,
he's involved in a lawsuit,

20:39.417 --> 20:43.011
and many of you
will be asked to testify,

20:44.522 --> 20:48.959
Now, remember,
he's one of us,

20:48.959 --> 20:52.519
so, talk to no one,

20:53.898 --> 20:55.888
That's all,

20:57.101 --> 20:59.136
You remember that, J.J.

20:59.136 --> 21:01.763
You're one of us,
not a "brother,"

21:02.606 --> 21:07.678
You know, you oughta learn
how to surf, Know what I mean?

21:07.678 --> 21:10.908
I got your surfboard,

21:13.417 --> 21:16.420
J.J., I just appreciate you being
my best man more than anything else,

21:16.420 --> 21:19.924
- It meant a lot to me to see you up there,
- Make sure it sticks,

21:19.924 --> 21:22.893
- I look forward to standing by you one day,
-  Hope it's catching!

21:22.893 --> 21:26.521
Yeah, well, um,

21:27.698 --> 21:30.301
I don't know if I belong
in the department, Pop,

21:30.301 --> 21:32.636
He should quit,
It's dangerous,

21:32.636 --> 21:36.974
It's not the danger,
it's all that B, S, and racism,

21:36.974 --> 21:39.601
Stress gettin' to you, huh, son?

21:41.412 --> 21:43.013
- Reverend Banks,
- Brother Johnson,

21:43.013 --> 21:44.815
Glad you could make it,
I hope you enjoyed the wedding,

21:44.815 --> 21:47.051
- I most certainly did,
- Let me introduce you to my son,

21:47.051 --> 21:50.755
J.J., have you met the Reverend Banks
of the Greater Green Baptist Church?

21:50.755 --> 21:53.357
- Reverend,
- I know of you,

21:53.357 --> 21:55.756
I'm sure Mr, Massey
told you not to talk to me,

21:57.294 --> 21:59.352
Did you ever ask why?

22:01.031 --> 22:05.402
- Ernie Marshall,
- You don't waste any time, do you?

22:05.402 --> 22:09.140
- He was murdered in that jail,
- There's no evidence of that,

22:09.140 --> 22:13.110
And I'm not supposed to talk
about this with anybody anyway,

22:13.110 --> 22:16.670
- I know where you stand,
- On my own two feet,

22:18.516 --> 22:21.352
Excuse me,

22:21.352 --> 22:24.522
Oh, boy,

22:24.522 --> 22:27.091
He always wanted to be a cop,

22:27.091 --> 22:28.318
Hmm,

22:58.856 --> 23:03.427
- Ten on six,
-  Hold it right there,

23:03.427 --> 23:06.430
- How you doin' tonight?
- All right,

23:06.430 --> 23:09.433
Can I see your driver's license,
please?

23:09.433 --> 23:11.135
It's in my back pocket,

23:11.135 --> 23:14.038
All right, just put your hands
on top of your head,

23:14.038 --> 23:16.307
Just put your hands
on top of your head, turn around,

23:16.307 --> 23:21.879
- How you doin' tonight, ma'am?
- I'm just gonna take your driver's license,

23:21.879 --> 23:25.783
- You mind turning the stereo down?
- Yes, I do mind,

23:25.783 --> 23:29.119
Turn your stereo down,
please, ma'am,

23:29.119 --> 23:32.713
All right, Mr, Woods, you can relax,

23:34.692 --> 23:40.687
Give me a wants and warrants on a
California driver's license, Charlie-325486,

23:43.133 --> 23:45.469
- Where you headed?
- To the movies,

23:45.469 --> 23:47.538
You goin' to the movies?
You goin' to a party?

23:47.538 --> 23:51.475
I said I was goin' to the movies, How am I
goin' to a party if I'm goin' to the movies?

23:51.475 --> 23:54.912
- Where'd you get that attitude, man?
- Why you stoppin' me, man? I did nothin',

23:54.912 --> 23:57.448
- What do you do for a living, Teddy?
- I work, like you,

23:57.448 --> 24:00.150
You work, How do you afford that car?
It's a nice car,

24:00.150 --> 24:01.785
- 'Cause I work, like you,
- You work, like me,

24:01.785 --> 24:02.753
Yeah,

24:02.753 --> 24:05.489
- You sell drugs?
- If you do,

24:05.489 --> 24:08.425
122, roger,
that's a 709 gone to warrant.

24:08.425 --> 24:11.795
That's a rog, You know you got
a warrant out for your arrest?

24:11.795 --> 24:14.298
Traffic violation,

24:14.298 --> 24:16.433
No,

24:16.433 --> 24:19.003
Forgot to go to court, huh?

24:19.003 --> 24:22.940
- Do you mind if I search the car?
- Not unless you got a warrant,

24:22.940 --> 24:25.142
- What do you got in the car, Teddy?
- I know my rights,

24:25.142 --> 24:29.446
Hey, man, if I arrest you,
that car is mine!

24:29.446 --> 24:32.349
I can rip it apart, take the seats out,
Is that what you want?

24:32.349 --> 24:35.408
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, brother!

24:36.887 --> 24:40.617
Now, what do you got in the car, man?
You got drugs? What do you got?

24:44.061 --> 24:46.864
I borrowed my girlfriend's father's gun,
It's under the driver's seat,

24:46.864 --> 24:49.633
Partner, we got a gun in the car,
Put your hands behind your head,

24:49.633 --> 24:52.703
- Turn around slow, lock your fingers!
- Ma'am, exit the driver's side,

24:52.703 --> 24:54.672
Step out of the vehicle,
Don't look anywhere else, Look at me,

24:54.672 --> 24:56.540
- I am gettin' out,
- Oww!

24:56.540 --> 24:58.342
- Spread your legs,
- You got any razor blades?

24:58.342 --> 25:01.078
Lock your fingers behind your head,
ma'am, Spread your legs,

25:01.078 --> 25:04.515
If I find anything sharp and I get cut,
I'm gonna be real pissed off,

25:04.515 --> 25:07.051
- You ain't got nothin' better to do, huh?
- I ain't got nothin' better to do,

25:07.051 --> 25:08.819
Neither do you, brother,

25:08.819 --> 25:11.655
- No goin' to the movies tonight,
- Oww!

25:11.655 --> 25:14.892
- These are too tight, man,
- They ain't made for comfort, Teddy,

25:14.892 --> 25:18.418
- I'll go get the gun,
- Stay right there,

25:29.540 --> 25:32.443
- These handcuffs are too tight!
- Shut up,

25:32.443 --> 25:36.173
- Partner, I have a gun!
-  Punk,

26:17.021 --> 26:18.954
Jesse,

26:25.629 --> 26:27.619
"Theodore Woods,"

26:29.366 --> 26:33.437
Check out the caliber
and make of the gun,

26:33.437 --> 26:35.427
Nine-millimeter,

26:45.649 --> 26:47.639
You sit down,

26:50.187 --> 26:52.177
Thank you, Officer,

27:10.274 --> 27:13.106
What are you lookin' at?

27:17.281 --> 27:19.850
How long have you had the gun?

27:19.850 --> 27:24.254
I don't know,
Took it a long time ago,

27:24.254 --> 27:27.458
Your girlfriend's father,
Mr, Taylor,

27:27.458 --> 27:30.094
says last time he looked at it
was three months ago,

27:30.094 --> 27:32.084
Whatever.

27:33.197 --> 27:36.767
- What have you been doin' with it?
- Did nothin' with it,

27:36.767 --> 27:39.166
I use it for protection only,

27:43.073 --> 27:46.235
What if I told you
it was used in a murder?

27:48.879 --> 27:51.115
Man, you crazy,

27:51.115 --> 27:55.953
What were you doin' September
7? Let me refresh your memory,

27:55.953 --> 28:00.691
You tried to rob a man named Greenspan,
you ended up killin' his wife,

28:00.691 --> 28:03.727
You're goin' to need a lawyer,

28:03.727 --> 28:07.998
You're lookin' at attempted robbery,
attempted murder, and murder,

28:07.998 --> 28:10.234
Teddy,

28:10.234 --> 28:13.737
nobody wants
to drag it all out with a trial,

28:13.737 --> 28:16.864
What we'll do is get you
only second-degree murder,

28:17.708 --> 28:20.944
I didn't kill nobody!
I didn't rob nobody!

28:20.944 --> 28:22.713
I've never even used a gun,

28:22.713 --> 28:25.149
All the state wants
is to close the books,

28:25.149 --> 28:28.777
The state doesn't care
if you get seven years or, life,

28:31.722 --> 28:33.746
Think about it,

28:34.758 --> 28:39.490
Like the song says,
"My skin is my sin,"

28:42.766 --> 28:47.104
Mr, Jose Castro,
You were here before me three years ago

28:47.104 --> 28:49.907
and you haven't learned English
in that time?

28:49.907 --> 28:54.845
Uh, Mr, Rodrigo,
You are interpreting his case?

28:54.845 --> 28:56.480
Yes, Your Honor,

28:56.480 --> 29:00.150
La acusación se trata de homicidio,
ponerle fuego a un edificio.

29:00.150 --> 29:02.152
- Qué dice usted?
- Tienen un hombre que no es.

29:02.152 --> 29:04.154
He says that
you've got the wrong man,

29:04.154 --> 29:06.890
Then he pleads "not guilty"
to both charges?

29:06.890 --> 29:10.060
- Entonces cómo contesta usted.
- Quiero explicarle.

29:10.060 --> 29:13.897
- He says that he would like to explain,
- Only when he is on trial,

29:13.897 --> 29:15.766
Can I have a moment
to speak to Mr, Castro?

29:15.766 --> 29:18.290
Sure, Mr, Lawson, Add to the backlog,

29:24.508 --> 29:26.643
People vs, Theodore Woods,

29:26.643 --> 29:31.815
Case number 293-8336,

29:31.815 --> 29:38.422
Mr, Woods, you are charged with
violating penal code section 187: Murder,

29:38.422 --> 29:41.358
Attempted murder,

29:41.358 --> 29:44.628
Attempted robbery,

29:44.628 --> 29:47.064
Your Honor, good morning,
I'm James Locket,

29:47.064 --> 29:50.100
Carmen Muñoz, for the defendant
Theodore Woods, Your Honor,

29:50.100 --> 29:52.302
How do you plead?

29:52.302 --> 29:55.138
- Man, I didn't do it,
- Guilty or not guilty?

29:55.138 --> 29:58.542
He pleads "not guilty," please,

29:58.542 --> 30:01.044
We ask the court for an O, R, release here,

30:01.044 --> 30:03.747
Mr, Woods has been
in the community his whole life,

30:03.747 --> 30:06.516
- he's been employed for three years,
- Denied,

30:06.516 --> 30:10.087
You must think I'm not playing
with a full deck,

30:10.087 --> 30:13.290
This is a potential
death penalty case,

30:13.290 --> 30:18.295
No, the best I can do
is $500,000 bail,

30:18.295 --> 30:20.931
How did you come
to represent Mr, Woods?

30:20.931 --> 30:24.301
Every time I look up,
I see you,

30:24.301 --> 30:27.201
Well, Your Honor, I,
I hope it's not a problem,

30:29.273 --> 30:31.263
Next case,

30:32.376 --> 30:36.280
People vs, Lyndon Dent,
Case number 657,

30:39.549 --> 30:44.254
Listen, if it wasn't for J.J., the police
might not have caught Teddy Woods,

30:44.254 --> 30:47.424
That is right, That's true,
All right, J.J.

30:47.424 --> 30:51.595
- Stand up, baby!
- OK, enough is enough, Sit down, now,

30:51.595 --> 30:55.299
Honey, I feel so proud,
having two strong sons,

30:55.299 --> 30:59.002
- Where's the other one? I only count one,
- Don't try it!

30:59.002 --> 31:01.492
So what are you waitin' on, J. J.?

31:03.774 --> 31:08.879
What am I waiting on? Uh...
What am I waitin' on?

31:08.879 --> 31:12.149
Buddy, explain
to your brother what I mean,

31:12.149 --> 31:15.018
- Mama's tired of you livin' in sin,
- Shut up, Buddy,

31:15.018 --> 31:16.520
- It's the truth,
- Shut up,

31:16.520 --> 31:20.190
You're gonna be surprised when
Barbara finds herself a nice guy,

31:20.190 --> 31:23.193
Barbara's not goin' anywhere,

31:23.193 --> 31:25.629
J.J.

31:25.629 --> 31:27.528
Don't look that way to me,

31:32.936 --> 31:36.206
What'd I do with my keys?
I know I left 'em...

31:36.206 --> 31:38.196
They're in your hand,

31:52.756 --> 31:56.460
It was a domestic call,
They're fightin' like cats and dogs,

31:56.460 --> 31:59.963
Hirsch looks at this guy... boom!
Hits him in the side of the head,

31:59.963 --> 32:04.524
The guy starts to cry, says, "What'd ya
hit me for? I'm the one who called ya,"

32:16.713 --> 32:18.703
Drug deal gone bad,

32:26.556 --> 32:29.353
You know him?

32:32.028 --> 32:36.464
Just thinkin' about the choices
a man makes in his life,

32:49.913 --> 32:55.407
Teddy, Mr, Greenspan identified you
as the one who shot his wife,

32:55.919 --> 32:58.250
He's straight lyin',

33:00.123 --> 33:03.717
Where my mom at, man?
Why she didn't bail me out?

33:04.728 --> 33:08.231
Where do you think your parents
are gonna get that kind of money?

33:08.231 --> 33:11.688
I don't know,
but I can't stay in here all day,

33:12.702 --> 33:14.771
They have a witness,

33:14.771 --> 33:17.107
a gun,

33:17.107 --> 33:19.676
and your funky attitude,

33:19.676 --> 33:23.713
- I didn't ask you to be my lawyer,
- Look, you killed someone,

33:23.713 --> 33:25.582
A white woman,

33:25.582 --> 33:27.284
I was talking to the prosecution,

33:27.284 --> 33:30.053
trying to see if they'd be interested
in doing a deal,

33:30.053 --> 33:33.356
They are so high,
This is a notch in their gun,

33:33.356 --> 33:36.813
I knew my mama
shoulda got me a white lawyer,

33:40.464 --> 33:43.261
I'm going to try this
one more time,

33:44.868 --> 33:47.871
Where were you on September 7?

33:47.871 --> 33:49.873
I don't remember,

33:49.873 --> 33:53.343
I don't remember where I was,
I don't remember what I was doin',

33:53.343 --> 33:56.046
but I damn sure
didn't kill no white woman,

33:56.046 --> 33:58.036
OK?

33:59.449 --> 34:02.552
Did the arresting officer
read you your rights?

34:02.552 --> 34:04.542
I don't remember,

34:06.189 --> 34:10.260
Did anyone other than you
have access to the gun?

34:10.260 --> 34:11.328
No,

34:11.328 --> 34:13.726
Are you protecting anyone?

34:15.998 --> 34:18.168
Do I look like a fool?

34:18.168 --> 34:21.737
- Believe in the death penalty?
- Yes, sir, I do,

34:21.737 --> 34:24.206
Have you ever been around
or worked with black people?

34:24.206 --> 34:26.009
No, sir,

34:26.009 --> 34:28.645
I would like to thank
and dismiss Miss Roberts, please,

34:28.645 --> 34:32.949
- Mr, Locket, the line is getting thin,
- I think it is highly unusual

34:32.949 --> 34:35.217
that every potential juror
believes in the death penalty,

34:35.217 --> 34:37.954
No one stacked the deck, People in
this state believe in the death penalty,

34:37.954 --> 34:40.581
Are you trying to
assume my duties, Mr, Kern?

34:41.257 --> 34:43.418
No, Your Honor,

34:44.761 --> 34:47.630
Look at this,
Greenspan, testifying,

34:47.630 --> 34:51.501
said that he would never forget Teddy
Woods was the man who shot his wife,

34:51.501 --> 34:55.572
When we questioned him on the scene
he was very vague about everything,

34:55.572 --> 34:58.642
The man just saw his wife get shot,
He was in shock,

34:58.642 --> 35:02.345
- The man was lying through his teeth!
- I think Baker's right,

35:02.345 --> 35:05.248
Women are just naturally
more suspicious,

35:05.248 --> 35:09.183
Baker didn't say "women,"
Baker said "Jews,"

35:11.755 --> 35:15.520
Well, I'm sure Baker's called me
worse names behind my back,

35:16.426 --> 35:18.762
I gotta go, give some tickets,

35:18.762 --> 35:20.163
- All right,
- I'll see you later,

35:20.163 --> 35:23.099
- Be safe, Trooper,
- That's another thing,

35:23.099 --> 35:27.337
Why do you call me that? "Trooper"?
What does that mean?

35:27.337 --> 35:31.033
That's what we call state policemen
where I come from,

35:33.843 --> 35:36.179
OK,

35:36.179 --> 35:37.681
Bye,

35:37.681 --> 35:42.310
Deputy Bono,
the record is vague,

35:44.554 --> 35:47.818
What reason did you have
to stop this car?

35:49.459 --> 35:54.664
- Well, it's a policy that if we see,
- You didn't stop him 'cause he's black?

35:54.664 --> 35:56.466
Well...

35:56.466 --> 35:58.268
Uh, yeah,

35:58.268 --> 36:01.871
- I mean, it's a policy,
- No, wait! Wait a minute,

36:01.871 --> 36:04.532
There can be no racial motive,

36:06.109 --> 36:09.669
Now, what reason
did you have to stop his car?

36:16.653 --> 36:18.221
Traffic violation?

36:18.221 --> 36:20.848
Beautiful,
Traffic violation,

36:23.860 --> 36:26.863
It was a traffic violation,

36:26.863 --> 36:29.695
Yeah,

36:39.943 --> 36:41.933
Way to go, Rich,

36:45.415 --> 36:47.439
Let's go,

36:49.753 --> 36:51.413
J.J.

36:53.757 --> 36:56.426
- We might lose that Teddy Woods case,
- What?

36:56.426 --> 37:00.697
Yeah, the prosecution says
I had no legal right to stop Teddy,

37:00.697 --> 37:03.433
that it was just luck that I stopped him

37:03.433 --> 37:06.002
and you happened to be there
to make the search,

37:06.002 --> 37:08.705
So I, uh,

37:08.705 --> 37:11.798
I told 'em that
he made an illegal turn,

37:16.413 --> 37:18.615
Yeah, well, uh...

37:18.615 --> 37:22.050
I got no sympathy
for lowlife scum, so,

37:24.020 --> 37:27.590
I'll tell 'em he ran
four or five red lights,

37:27.590 --> 37:29.993
- Yeah?
- Yeah,

37:29.993 --> 37:32.324
That's great, man,

37:33.897 --> 37:35.231
Thanks,

37:35.231 --> 37:39.035
Listen, man, if you ever
need anybody to back you up,

37:39.035 --> 37:41.059
I'll be there, man,

37:42.105 --> 37:43.807
OK,

37:43.807 --> 37:45.797
Great,

37:51.548 --> 37:55.719
On the evening of September 7,
why did you stop Teddy Woods?

37:55.719 --> 37:59.222
- Was he doing something suspicious?
- Yes, sir,

37:59.222 --> 38:02.492
- He made an illegal turn,
- That was the reason?

38:02.492 --> 38:07.197
- And no other reason?
- I object, Your Honor, It's argumentative,

38:07.197 --> 38:10.723
- Sustained,
- No further questions,

38:20.744 --> 38:23.379
This isn't looking good,

38:23.379 --> 38:25.815
Let's not give up now,

38:25.815 --> 38:29.352
We gotta have the faith
that it's gonna be all right,

38:29.352 --> 38:32.856
Did Teddy Woods tell you
where he got the gun?

38:32.856 --> 38:37.794
Yes, He said he got it
from his girlfriend's father,

38:37.794 --> 38:42.594
Did he say that he took it,
or that he stole it?

38:44.367 --> 38:46.903
He said, "I stole it,"

38:46.903 --> 38:50.073
Would you please speak up,
Deputy Johnson?

38:50.073 --> 38:54.511
Deputy Johnson, please speak up
so that the jury members can hear you,

38:54.511 --> 38:59.038
- He said, "I stole it,"
- "I stole the gun,"

38:59.649 --> 39:02.048
- "I stole the gun,"
- Objection!

39:03.653 --> 39:06.022
No further questions,

39:06.022 --> 39:10.794
Deputy Bono said
you witnessed the illegal turn?

39:10.794 --> 39:12.328
Yes, sir,

39:12.328 --> 39:14.697
Hmm,

39:14.697 --> 39:17.734
You were closer to the scene,

39:17.734 --> 39:21.134
but Deputy Bono made the arrest?

39:22.305 --> 39:25.275
Well, I was in the process of taking
his license plate and calling it in

39:25.275 --> 39:29.145
when Deputy Bono
pulled in behind him,

39:29.145 --> 39:30.980
I see,

39:30.980 --> 39:33.917
No further questions,

39:33.917 --> 39:38.721
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

39:38.721 --> 39:42.425
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

39:42.425 --> 39:44.415
so help you God?

40:05.081 --> 40:10.220
Mr, Greenspan, would you say that
you and your wife got along?

40:10.220 --> 40:13.223
- We enjoyed each other's company,
- I see,

40:13.223 --> 40:16.226
- We were married for 20 years,
- Mm-hm,

40:16.226 --> 40:18.386
I loved my wife,

40:19.395 --> 40:22.065
You testified that on September 7,

40:22.065 --> 40:25.768
Teddy Woods shot your wife
from your side of the car,

40:25.768 --> 40:29.639
How is it, sir, that the bullet
traveled from a lower angle?

40:29.639 --> 40:33.676
He would've had to have been
on his knees with the car door open

40:33.676 --> 40:35.445
- for that to happen,
- I don't know,

40:35.445 --> 40:38.815
I am not done with
the questioning here, Mr, Greenspan,

40:38.815 --> 40:43.753
You said that a man approached
your wife on the passenger side,

40:43.753 --> 40:47.557
and the shooter
stuck a gun to your head,

40:47.557 --> 40:51.961
And when your wife refused
to surrender her purse,

40:51.961 --> 40:56.032
the shooter then turned his gun
and shot your wife in the head,

40:57.166 --> 41:01.004
Now, how could that happen
and you not sustain any hearing damage?

41:01.004 --> 41:03.039
You had no powder burns on your shirt,

41:03.039 --> 41:05.108
Objection!
Let him answer the question,

41:05.108 --> 41:07.710
Sustained, Mr, Locket,
you're badgering the witness,

41:07.710 --> 41:11.047
This is all very curious to me,

41:11.047 --> 41:13.037
And frankly, I'm puzzled,

41:15.051 --> 41:21.182
Well, l-I had no damage to my ear,
and I wasn't checked for powder traces,

41:23.293 --> 41:25.261
Mr, Greenspan,

41:25.261 --> 41:30.166
if I put a gun to your head
and then turn and shoot your wife,

41:30.166 --> 41:32.869
how could the bullet travel
at an upward angle?

41:32.869 --> 41:35.471
Objection! Mr, Greenspan
is not an expert in ballistics,

41:35.471 --> 41:36.606
Sustained,

41:36.606 --> 41:39.442
Mr, Locket, if you continue in this line,
I will hold you in contempt,

41:39.442 --> 41:42.912
I'm trying to establish here,
with all the evidence at hand,

41:42.912 --> 41:46.916
- that this man is probably lying!
- Objection! Move to strike,

41:46.916 --> 41:50.119
Sustained, The jury
will disregard the last statement,

41:50.119 --> 41:52.109
Thank you, Your Honor,

41:54.624 --> 41:58.361
Why do you always have to
carry your gun?

41:58.361 --> 42:01.464
'Cause I'm always on duty,

42:01.464 --> 42:04.801
- You've changed,
- Look, don't start that again, please,

42:04.801 --> 42:06.791
Please,

42:08.371 --> 42:11.737
Why are you trying
to look older, tougher?

42:13.977 --> 42:16.179
'Cause I am older,

42:16.179 --> 42:17.747
Wiser, too,

42:17.747 --> 42:21.250
You know, you might have to
kill someone in the line of duty,

42:21.250 --> 42:23.547
Damn! I'm a peace officer,

42:27.256 --> 42:31.761
Why can't we ever have a conversation
without my job coming up?

42:31.761 --> 42:33.523
OK?

42:35.665 --> 42:37.655
- OK,
- Thank you,

42:39.268 --> 42:42.532
- Looking good, Ryan,
- Thank you, sir,

42:43.539 --> 42:46.442
Deputy Fields,
you do not impress anybody

42:46.442 --> 42:48.978
with the amount of words
that you use in your report,

42:48.978 --> 42:52.548
It's not supposed to
look like a personal diary,

42:52.548 --> 42:54.550
Yes, sir,

42:54.550 --> 42:56.452
- How are you, Deputy Bono?
- Very good, sir,

42:56.452 --> 43:00.957
- Looking good, Hold your stomach in,
- Thank you, sir,

43:00.957 --> 43:05.728
Mr, Johnson, I understand that
you will be off probation soon,

43:05.728 --> 43:07.797
Your work has improved,

43:07.797 --> 43:12.426
There will be a final review,
so get everything together,

43:13.903 --> 43:16.336
- I'm very proud of you,
- Yes, sir,

44:27.243 --> 44:30.079
Thank you, sir,
Have a nice day,

44:30.079 --> 44:32.808
Yeah, you do the same,

44:35.551 --> 44:37.017
- Troop,
- Hey,

44:40.156 --> 44:43.426
- You shoot somebody?
- In a way,

44:43.426 --> 44:45.661
You did or you didn't?

44:45.661 --> 44:49.232
The, uh, serial number on the gun
I picked up with Teddy Woods

44:49.232 --> 44:52.235
has been changed
on my arrest report,

44:52.235 --> 44:54.702
- Damn,
- Why would somebody do that?

44:57.373 --> 45:00.102
Because Teddy Woods
is a perfect suspect,

45:01.444 --> 45:05.448
Because nobody's gonna give a hoot
or holler if Teddy Woods is put to death,

45:05.448 --> 45:10.253
- He's got to be guilty, He's got to be guilty,
- Why does he got to be guilty?

45:10.253 --> 45:13.689
'Cause I,
I lied about his arrest,

45:13.689 --> 45:16.885
- We had no reason to pick him up,
- J.J.!

45:35.511 --> 45:39.947
Hey, Foster, This the cell
where Ernie Marshall hung himself?

45:40.783 --> 45:42.306
Yeah,

45:43.886 --> 45:47.821
How can a man hang himself
in one of these cells?

45:54.430 --> 45:58.263
- Give anybody enough rope, J.J.
- What?

46:00.803 --> 46:03.339
J.J., don't go stickin'
your nose into anything,

46:03.339 --> 46:05.772
I'm gonna tell you somethin',

46:07.176 --> 46:13.082
There are some decent deputies here,
but don't go looking into a loaded gun,

46:13.082 --> 46:14.750
I hope you understand
what I'm sayin',

46:14.750 --> 46:20.223
If you know anything, just keep
your mouth shut, No more questions,

46:20.223 --> 46:22.925
- You never told anybody?
- There is no one to tell,

46:22.925 --> 46:25.085
Don't you understand?

46:27.296 --> 46:30.566
A councilperson's wife gets
picked up for shoplifting,

46:30.566 --> 46:33.002
A prominent citizen
involved in a hit-and-run,

46:33.002 --> 46:35.705
No investigations,
no charges,

46:35.705 --> 46:39.375
A state senator can't stop
pickin' up young boys,

46:39.375 --> 46:43.012
No charges,
But they pay,

46:43.012 --> 46:45.548
And you multiply that
by days and nights,

46:45.548 --> 46:48.784
and you'll understand
what kind of a dark hole this place is,

46:48.784 --> 46:52.651
- But everybody's not corrupt,
- Everybody makes mistakes!

46:56.158 --> 46:58.194
- Jane?
- Yeah?

46:58.194 --> 47:00.863
That was your sister,
She wants you to call her back,

47:00.863 --> 47:02.431
Oh, All right,

47:02.431 --> 47:05.401
You wanna come get him?
I think he's wet,

47:05.401 --> 47:09.005
I'll take over,
Oh, come here,

47:09.005 --> 47:10.573
Well, you know,
she probably wants to know

47:10.573 --> 47:13.409
if we've decided to
go with them on the cruise,

47:13.409 --> 47:15.978
What do you think?

47:15.978 --> 47:17.513
You know, that's a hell of a lot
of money and trouble

47:17.513 --> 47:23.052
to end up on a boat with a bunch of people
that you don't really care a lot about,

47:23.052 --> 47:27.957
It's not a bunch of people,
It's just family, Hm?

47:27.957 --> 47:30.982
Let's go get you taken care of, huh?

47:41.904 --> 47:45.274
We get you
a new diaper, huh?

47:45.274 --> 47:47.707
Get rid of that wet one,

48:15.438 --> 48:18.507
I still haven't found the registration,
Make yourself at home,

48:18.507 --> 48:21.744
OK, thank you,
Take your time,

48:21.744 --> 48:26.043
I'd rather not ask the police
for it if I can help it,

48:29.185 --> 48:30.515
Whoo!

48:34.423 --> 48:37.880
If it's not in here,
I don't know where it is,

48:52.475 --> 48:56.579
Juan, una cita
el 18 de este mes.

48:56.579 --> 48:59.749
Dispense.
When you get a moment, please,

48:59.749 --> 49:02.518
- Yeah, I got your message,
- We'll talk about it,

49:02.518 --> 49:04.280
All right,

49:06.422 --> 49:10.393
Well, gentlemen, we almost shot
ourselves in the foot with this one,

49:10.393 --> 49:13.496
Look, a nine-millimeter
is a very, very common pistol,

49:13.496 --> 49:16.799
In fact, it'd be very difficult
to tell which gun is which

49:16.799 --> 49:19.301
without close examination
of the serial number,

49:19.301 --> 49:21.670
Excuse me,
Mr, Sears is on line two,

49:21.670 --> 49:24.866
- Westgate Life Insurance,
- Thank you, Joyce,

49:26.275 --> 49:30.479
With the Ernie Marshall case
and the Cruz case,

49:30.479 --> 49:33.916
Hello?
Yes, Mr, Sears,

49:33.916 --> 49:37.019
Thank you for calling me back,
I appreciate that,

49:37.019 --> 49:39.021
Yes, sir,

49:39.021 --> 49:42.691
Mr, Greenspan's
the sole beneficiary?

49:42.691 --> 49:45.561
Well, now, sir,
wait a minute,

49:45.561 --> 49:49.765
There is a possibility that someone in the
sheriff's department is involved in all this,

49:49.765 --> 49:53.427
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you? Mm-hm,

49:54.437 --> 49:57.206
Very well,
Yes, we'll talk again,

49:57.206 --> 49:59.196
Thanks for calling,

50:00.776 --> 50:03.612
I, It,

50:03.612 --> 50:06.315
You know, you give 'em
a chance to smell a rat,

50:06.315 --> 50:10.148
and they all begin to dig with
picks and shovels - it's amazing,

50:10.753 --> 50:14.857
I think Officer Johnson is
the one who tipped us on this,

50:14.857 --> 50:19.028
Well, then, James, we're just gonna have
to bring him back to the witness stand,

50:19.028 --> 50:22.258
Carmen, you'll put
that man's life in danger,

50:23.466 --> 50:25.456
So be it,

50:27.036 --> 50:29.939
Life is about making hard choices,

50:29.939 --> 50:31.941
Mr, Taylor,

50:31.941 --> 50:36.741
the bullet that killed Mrs, Greenspan
came from this gun,

50:37.546 --> 50:40.483
Teddy Woods said
he stole your gun,

50:40.483 --> 50:45.852
This is the weapon said to be
in his possession when he was arrested,

50:47.089 --> 50:49.458
- This your gun?
- It looks like mine,

50:49.458 --> 50:54.053
- But is it your gun?
- I'll have to check the serial number,

51:08.777 --> 51:11.914
This is not my gun,
The gun I bought has a different number,

51:11.914 --> 51:14.917
- And what's in your hand, sir?
- This is my original registration,

51:14.917 --> 51:18.354
May I see it, please?
Thank you,

51:18.354 --> 51:21.413
This is his original registration,

51:22.925 --> 51:25.620
It does not match this gun,

51:26.762 --> 51:28.888
Folks, this is not his gun,

51:33.168 --> 51:37.339
I would like to admit
this gun registration into evidence,

51:37.339 --> 51:39.975
Very well, Mr, Locket,

51:39.975 --> 51:42.578
Any objection, Mr, Kern?

51:42.578 --> 51:46.604
Mr, Taylor, this, then,
obviously is not your gun,

51:48.817 --> 51:50.886
But let's not be confused,

51:50.886 --> 51:55.788
This is the murder weapon
that Teddy Woods was picked up with,

51:57.159 --> 51:59.820
No further questions,

52:00.863 --> 52:04.767
I checked every hit-and-run case
from five years before Marshall's death,

52:04.767 --> 52:07.903
- Nothing,
- You may be reading too much into Foster,

52:07.903 --> 52:10.906
No! Foster was saying
that somebody in the department

52:10.906 --> 52:14.643
was blackmailing somebody
on the city council,

52:14.643 --> 52:18.043
So what if we find something?
What do we do?

52:41.303 --> 52:43.463
- Hey,
-  Hey,

52:45.841 --> 52:47.042
What time?

52:47.042 --> 52:50.446
What do you think the deal is
with Johnson and Fields?

52:50.446 --> 52:55.576
Hanky-panky, I caught 'em back there
acting pretty suspicious,

52:57.620 --> 53:00.110
I'd better not catch 'em,

53:02.658 --> 53:06.261
I would like to call
Mr, Greenspan to the stand,

53:06.261 --> 53:08.831
Mr, Greenspan has
suffered a great loss,

53:08.831 --> 53:12.129
Would Mr, Greenspan
please take the stand?

53:13.135 --> 53:16.365
You are still under oath,
Mr, Greenspan,

53:21.910 --> 53:23.979
Mr, Greenspan,

53:23.979 --> 53:27.983
did you know anyone
working at the Edgemar Station

53:27.983 --> 53:30.419
before your wife was murdered?

53:30.419 --> 53:32.409
No, I didn't,

53:35.124 --> 53:38.494
You never met
Deputies Baker or Hall?

53:38.494 --> 53:40.562
Your Honor, I believe
Mr, Greenspan answered that,

53:40.562 --> 53:44.033
Mr, Locket, Mr, Greenspan
answered the question,

53:44.033 --> 53:50.062
I want it on record
that he includes Deputies Hall and Baker,

53:51.974 --> 53:54.543
That will be all, Mr, Greenspan,

53:54.543 --> 53:56.879
Thank you,

53:56.879 --> 54:01.440
The court will recess
until after lunch, which will be 2:30,

54:02.084 --> 54:05.654
Mr, Greenspan, I'm George Beaten
and this is Robert Hill,

54:05.654 --> 54:07.823
We're both from
Westgate Life Insurance,

54:07.823 --> 54:10.059
Can we have a moment?
We can order lunch,

54:10.059 --> 54:12.761
- This isn't a good time,
-  It would help our investigation,

54:12.761 --> 54:17.533
- What investigation?
- We look into large death benefit claims,

54:17.533 --> 54:20.335
Well, your company indicated
everything was satisfactory,

54:20.335 --> 54:25.101
In cases involving murder, Mr, Greenspan,
nothing is totally satisfactory,

54:27.309 --> 54:32.143
I'll be glad to talk with you, so long
as my lawyer is present, Thank you,

54:38.287 --> 54:39.888
- What happened?
- I don't know,

54:39.888 --> 54:43.425
Well, why don't you find out and fix it?
You got this subpoena, just like I did,

54:43.425 --> 54:46.929
That oughta tell you something,

54:46.929 --> 54:50.999
Jesse, you can't go into court
looking like this,

54:50.999 --> 54:54.002
Oh, I'II, I'll spruce
myself up, you know,

54:54.002 --> 54:56.572
Pinch my cheeks,
take in a bottle of Geritol,

54:56.572 --> 55:00.598
I hope you last that long,

55:03.112 --> 55:05.102
Fix it,

55:33.509 --> 55:39.344
Officer is requesting assistance
on a California license plate 3ACU,

55:50.859 --> 55:52.427
Roger, we copy request...

55:52.427 --> 55:55.554
Driver, step out of the car!

56:00.202 --> 56:02.863
Hey! Driver, step out of the car!

56:09.444 --> 56:13.209
- Oh, man, get down!
- Let's go, let's go!

56:20.722 --> 56:25.093
- You were lucky you had this on,
- My girlfriend made me wear it,

56:25.093 --> 56:27.560
- How many rounds you get off?
- Uh...

56:29.031 --> 56:31.433
About a load and a half,

56:31.433 --> 56:34.036
We need to know
the exact number of bullets,

56:34.036 --> 56:39.708
We'll take some x-rays, make sure the
impact didn't cause any internal damage,

56:39.708 --> 56:43.779
I know it hurts,
It's like getting hit with a bat,

56:43.779 --> 56:45.939
Just hang in there, man,

56:46.882 --> 56:49.315
Hold on,
You're doin' fine, man,

56:50.219 --> 56:54.052
- It's all right,
- I'll put down 18,

57:23.785 --> 57:27.890
Death was caused
by repeated blows to the head,

57:27.890 --> 57:30.325
Face and hands
burnt with acid solution,

57:30.325 --> 57:35.591
making identification impossible,
except with dental records,

57:36.965 --> 57:41.060
John Doe, white male,
aged 50 to 55,

57:44.005 --> 57:48.976
How is it that Deputy Johnson made
a mistake on the serial number of the gun?

57:48.976 --> 57:52.647
Deputy Johnson constantly
makes error after error,

57:52.647 --> 57:55.917
- Look at these work sheets,
- Oh, OK, good, That's good,

57:55.917 --> 57:59.720
How is it possible that the gun
that the department had in its possession

57:59.720 --> 58:01.622
was used to murder Mrs, Greenspan?

58:01.622 --> 58:04.458
All right, we're investigating
several people within the department,

58:04.458 --> 58:09.964
For example, trustees who may have had
a special relationship with Teddy Woods,

58:09.964 --> 58:16.237
What about the rumors that some of your
officers are prone to excessive violence?

58:16.237 --> 58:22.476
Ira, I can simply say,
this department operates within the law,

58:22.476 --> 58:25.646
No, No, Clarence,
That, that is not a good answer,

58:25.646 --> 58:27.882
Well, give me a better one,

58:27.882 --> 58:31.373
Look, when we get
into the courtroom, we are a team,

58:32.386 --> 58:38.226
OK, Now everything from here on out
is off the record, all right?

58:38.226 --> 58:41.896
Why do you say
you don't make mistakes?

58:41.896 --> 58:45.433
'Cause Watch Commander Massey
is always on my case,

58:45.433 --> 58:48.970
I check every arrest report
several times before I file it,

58:48.970 --> 58:51.772
If you look at my reports, all of 'em
except for the Teddy Woods report,

58:51.772 --> 58:53.808
you'll see that they're very clear,

58:53.808 --> 58:57.278
That will contradict Massey,
of course,

58:57.278 --> 59:00.214
Sears is on line one,

59:00.214 --> 59:02.204
Excuse me,

59:03.351 --> 59:05.786
Hello,

59:05.786 --> 59:08.055
Hello,

59:08.055 --> 59:10.545
- Which line is it?
- Line one,

59:12.126 --> 59:15.630
- You are a very lucky young man,
-  Hello,

59:15.630 --> 59:19.395
- I don't feel so lucky,
- Greenspan is missing?

59:20.901 --> 59:25.360
That's bad news,
That is very bad news,

59:27.074 --> 59:31.601
Why didn't you, Mr, Kern,
inform me that Greenspan was missing?

59:33.781 --> 59:36.951
- No one knew that he was missing,
- I was talking to Mr, Kern here,

59:36.951 --> 59:41.455
You have a bad habit
of hiding information from us,

59:41.455 --> 59:43.991
The body that was found
is Mr, Greenspan?

59:43.991 --> 59:46.515
That's correct, Your Honor,

59:48.929 --> 59:50.698
Please don't smoke, sir,

59:50.698 --> 59:54.201
Westgate Life Insurance
had been investigating Greenspan

59:54.201 --> 59:57.505
for trying to hire someone
to kill his wife,

59:57.505 --> 01:00:01.676
Mr, Greenspan was having
an affair for many years,

01:00:01.676 --> 01:00:06.237
- Having a mistress isn't against the law,
- It is in my book,

01:00:14.922 --> 01:00:16.957
What?

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:24.096
Uh, this case should now
be under the jurisdiction of the FBI,

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:27.802
- Mr, Williams fled the state to avoid,
- Give it to me,

01:00:27.802 --> 01:00:30.895
I'll look after it,

01:00:31.605 --> 01:00:34.041
You know it's the old man's
birthday comin' up,

01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:36.377
Yeah, I got something picked out,

01:00:36.377 --> 01:00:39.480
Here he comes,

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.212
How can a man
abuse his own child?

01:00:45.386 --> 01:00:47.455
Or any child?

01:00:47.455 --> 01:00:49.890
Any news on the gun
that was used on Johnson?

01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:51.992
Yeah, it's clean,
So's the car,

01:00:51.992 --> 01:00:55.696
- You heard about Greenspan?
- Yeah, it was in all the newspapers,

01:00:55.696 --> 01:00:58.332
What kind of a man was he?

01:00:58.332 --> 01:01:00.468
- What, Greenspan?
- Greenspan, yes,

01:01:00.468 --> 01:01:03.300
Like any victim,

01:01:05.172 --> 01:01:07.469
My wife,

01:01:09.977 --> 01:01:12.346
Watch his head,

01:01:12.346 --> 01:01:15.116
Stop trying to talk, Just be quiet,

01:01:15.116 --> 01:01:17.845
- Somebody get some water!
- Call the hospital!

01:01:18.853 --> 01:01:22.049
- Jesus God, he stopped breathing,
-  No pulse,

01:01:23.891 --> 01:01:26.327
- Is he taking any medication?
- Yes, it's in his drawer there,

01:01:26.327 --> 01:01:28.596
Call a paramedic!

01:01:28.596 --> 01:01:30.790
They're on the way,

01:01:33.167 --> 01:01:36.499
One, two, three,
four, five...

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:43.277
One, two, three, four, five,

01:01:43.277 --> 01:01:45.403
Gilmore, get over here,

01:01:47.081 --> 01:01:49.984
- One, two, three,
- Come on, Jesse,

01:01:49.984 --> 01:01:52.543
- , four, five,
- Breathe!

01:01:56.257 --> 01:01:58.959
- Gene,
- C'mon, Jesse, C'mon, Jesse,

01:01:58.959 --> 01:02:01.085
Come on, Pops, breathe,

01:02:03.564 --> 01:02:05.554
- Gene,
- Yeah?

01:02:11.205 --> 01:02:12.899
Gene,

01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:16.800
He's gone,

01:02:28.322 --> 01:02:30.653
Will someone go out,

01:02:34.361 --> 01:02:36.590
lower the flag?

01:02:48.008 --> 01:02:50.411
Hey, sarge,
What you doin' back there?

01:02:50.411 --> 01:02:53.709
Budget cuts, J.J.
They got me fillin' in again,

01:02:54.482 --> 01:02:57.151
Why's the flag at half-mast?

01:02:57.151 --> 01:02:59.175
Hall died,

01:03:00.855 --> 01:03:02.923
Well, that's too bad,

01:03:02.923 --> 01:03:05.759
That depends,

01:03:10.064 --> 01:03:12.600
Come on, man, I thought you guys
were gonna push me down there!

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.568
- It'll be the first time you hit the pins,
- Oh, right, thanks a lot,

01:03:14.568 --> 01:03:17.905
Hey, I got three to pick up,
Where you goin'?

01:03:17.905 --> 01:03:21.141
- Come on, fellas!
- Pick 'em up, Gilmore,

01:03:21.141 --> 01:03:23.472
Easy spare,
Roll her up,

01:03:25.846 --> 01:03:28.582
Why weren't you at Hall's funeral?

01:03:28.582 --> 01:03:31.919
- I had a bad case of diarrhea,
- Diarrhea, my ass,

01:03:31.919 --> 01:03:34.955
- What's the problem?
- Murder!

01:03:34.955 --> 01:03:38.559
Don't make accusations
you can't prove,

01:03:38.559 --> 01:03:41.061
You guys are turning this place
into a bloodbath,

01:03:41.061 --> 01:03:43.430
- Those people were scum!
- You think we're any better than they are?

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:45.522
You're damn right!

01:03:46.867 --> 01:03:49.733
You don't want to be an outsider,

01:03:51.772 --> 01:03:53.762
Maybe I do,

01:05:14.855 --> 01:05:17.755
Puttin' in a little overtime, Fields?

01:05:18.692 --> 01:05:21.929
You know, all our files
are public property,

01:05:21.929 --> 01:05:24.362
All you have to do is ask,

01:05:45.219 --> 01:05:49.356
This is an account of
a criminal case that went nowhere,

01:05:49.356 --> 01:05:51.323
What,

01:05:56.296 --> 01:06:03.370
Uh, "The witness states that the defendant
is not the one she'd originally I, D,'d,"

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:06.573
She thought she'd identified
the driver in a lineup,

01:06:06.573 --> 01:06:09.443
But the man on trial
was not the same man,

01:06:09.443 --> 01:06:14.348
The only thing she remembered about
the original suspect was his license plate:

01:06:14.348 --> 01:06:17.051
"L-T-S-G-T-11,"

01:06:17.051 --> 01:06:18.986
The whole case
got thrown out of court,

01:06:18.986 --> 01:06:24.981
But the hit-and-run driver in the lineup
must have been booked and fingerprinted,

01:06:26.927 --> 01:06:30.197
Chuck was the officer on the scene,

01:06:30.197 --> 01:06:34.132
And his original report
would be in storage,

01:06:35.135 --> 01:06:37.125
Who says detective work is hard?

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:46.113
- The natives are restless,
- We received information

01:06:46.113 --> 01:06:49.717
that drugs are going to
be transferred at 408 Pine Road,

01:06:49.717 --> 01:06:51.852
the house that
Scott and Peters have been watching,

01:06:51.852 --> 01:06:57.291
Now, get this, gentlemen,
The D, E, A, is going to back us up this time,

01:06:57.291 --> 01:06:59.560
This is going to be our prize,

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.496
The assignment?
Baker and the Rough Riders,

01:07:04.898 --> 01:07:07.134
All right, everybody,
Listen up,

01:07:07.134 --> 01:07:10.871
I want you all to report to me
individually for your work assignments,

01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:15.142
Now let's hit some home runs
on this one, huh?

01:07:15.142 --> 01:07:17.507
Let's do it, Let's do it,

01:08:04.324 --> 01:08:08.128
I don't know why S, W, A, T,
didn't take this place,

01:08:08.128 --> 01:08:10.425
Massey needs a trophy,

01:08:13.634 --> 01:08:15.402
Sheriff's department!
We got a warrant,

01:08:15.402 --> 01:08:17.130
Hit it!

01:08:20.006 --> 01:08:22.843
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:08:32.051 --> 01:08:36.453
All clear. Repeat. All clear.

01:08:54.841 --> 01:08:56.832
What?

01:08:59.546 --> 01:09:02.115
Tell 'em we're at
the back door, comin' in,

01:09:02.115 --> 01:09:06.345
Baker, we're at the back door,

01:09:11.758 --> 01:09:14.191
Baker, we're at the back door,

01:09:32.845 --> 01:09:35.148
What are you guys doing here?

01:09:35.148 --> 01:09:37.818
- It's over,
- Over? Nobody informed us,

01:09:37.818 --> 01:09:40.153
Didn't you just hear
Baker say it was over?

01:09:40.153 --> 01:09:43.357
We were told to hold
this position, period,

01:09:43.357 --> 01:09:46.326
- What channel are you guys on?
- Three,

01:09:46.326 --> 01:09:48.395
Tell me, why is this walkie-talkie on four?

01:09:48.395 --> 01:09:51.131
Look, three's the channel,
Everything's been going over on three,

01:09:51.131 --> 01:09:53.433
Now get back to that house,
It's not secured,

01:09:53.433 --> 01:09:55.423
Go!

01:09:56.503 --> 01:09:58.493
Stupid rookies,

01:10:05.712 --> 01:10:08.715
- You owe me one, Troop,
- Oh, what do I owe you?

01:10:08.715 --> 01:10:11.652
Imagine what would have happened
if I hadn't smelled a rat,

01:10:11.652 --> 01:10:16.256
I'm filing a report, We could've been
killed by somebody's stupid mistake,

01:10:16.256 --> 01:10:18.125
Yeah, well, I'm not going back in there
till the lights come on

01:10:18.125 --> 01:10:20.854
and the chief comes out that back door,

01:10:22.896 --> 01:10:26.558
Code four. Code four.

01:10:43.517 --> 01:10:46.383
Yes, Yes, I know,

01:10:48.622 --> 01:10:50.987
Yeah, OK,

01:10:52.793 --> 01:10:56.196
- It was a bad night, What is it?
- Baker gave us the wrong information,

01:10:56.196 --> 01:10:59.099
- What are you talking about?
- We were told, on a separate channel,

01:10:59.099 --> 01:11:02.269
to make entry through the rear of the
premises while the situation was still hot,

01:11:02.269 --> 01:11:04.838
- Everybody was on channel three,
- We were on channel four,

01:11:04.838 --> 01:11:06.907
Did you check your walkie-talkies?

01:11:06.907 --> 01:11:08.875
The walkie-talkies
were given to us on that channel,

01:11:08.875 --> 01:11:10.944
- By Baker?
- No, sir, By a deputy,

01:11:10.944 --> 01:11:13.814
And if we had come in through that back
door at that instant, we would've been shot,

01:11:13.814 --> 01:11:15.115
What are you getting at?

01:11:15.115 --> 01:11:18.185
It looked as if somebody was
hoping we were stupid enough

01:11:18.185 --> 01:11:20.954
to walk in through that back door
while the operation was still in progress,

01:11:20.954 --> 01:11:24.624
If you had done your job, you would
have checked your walkie-talkie,

01:11:24.624 --> 01:11:27.728
It seems to me as though
you made a mistake, almost paid for it,

01:11:27.728 --> 01:11:31.131
- and now you're looking for a conspiracy,
- No, sir, No, sir,

01:11:31.131 --> 01:11:33.633
The situation felt strange
from the very beginning,

01:11:33.633 --> 01:11:36.303
Don't you talk to me about strange,

01:11:36.303 --> 01:11:41.041
- I am requesting an investigation,
- If you don't like it here, transfer,

01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:44.811
Stop trying to be a missionary
and save the natives,

01:11:44.811 --> 01:11:48.268
Let the professionals
police this jungle!

01:11:49.282 --> 01:11:51.551
I have the right
to work here, sir,

01:11:51.551 --> 01:11:55.255
You have the right to work here,
but you don't fit in,

01:11:55.255 --> 01:11:58.492
- Fit into what?
- I run this damn station,

01:11:58.492 --> 01:12:01.428
and I have the right
to keep you from slandering it,

01:12:01.428 --> 01:12:07.127
I have the right to have a competent staff
of dedicated men who like their work,

01:12:08.135 --> 01:12:10.604
This department will change, Mr, Massey,

01:12:10.604 --> 01:12:13.774
Really? Would you care
to give me a time frame?

01:12:13.774 --> 01:12:17.300
- It will be soon, sir,
- This meeting is over,

01:12:20.547 --> 01:12:22.537
Over,

01:12:24.351 --> 01:12:28.889
I had asked the city council
to investigate the Edgemar Station,

01:12:28.889 --> 01:12:31.625
But Massey came down on me hard
in the council chamber,

01:12:31.625 --> 01:12:35.495
Councilman Ross,
how could a city government

01:12:35.495 --> 01:12:38.865
be hustled
by the sheriff's department?

01:12:38.865 --> 01:12:41.535
Well, in the case of Ernie Marshall,
we knew something was fishy,

01:12:41.535 --> 01:12:43.670
but the city just
couldn't afford a lawsuit,

01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:46.606
That, at least, should tell you
whose side we were on,

01:12:46.606 --> 01:12:51.211
And because the sheriff's
in-house investigation

01:12:51.211 --> 01:12:53.847
cleared themselves
of any wrongdoing,

01:12:53.847 --> 01:12:56.872
And you will testify
to that in court?

01:12:57.818 --> 01:13:01.184
I'd like to, but,
the city would be up the ying-yang,

01:13:03.623 --> 01:13:06.026
I believe in Teddy's innocence,

01:13:06.026 --> 01:13:09.863
Now, do you want him to go to jail
for something he did not do?

01:13:09.863 --> 01:13:12.199
No.

01:13:12.199 --> 01:13:15.497
But you have to understand
city government,

01:13:18.038 --> 01:13:20.062
- Hey,
- Hi,

01:13:21.074 --> 01:13:23.910
- I checked out the house on Pine Street,
- Mm-hm,

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:25.979
It had been raided three times,

01:13:25.979 --> 01:13:28.048
There was a sting operation there once,

01:13:28.048 --> 01:13:30.183
and two people have been murdered
on the front lawn,

01:13:30.183 --> 01:13:32.719
Now, what drug dealer would
operate out of that house?

01:13:32.719 --> 01:13:35.922
Still not enough
to prove it was a setup,

01:13:35.922 --> 01:13:40.527
I checked through Chuck's old records,
Nothin' there,

01:13:40.527 --> 01:13:42.662
- So all we have is that license plate,
- Maybe,

01:13:42.662 --> 01:13:46.066
But there's a picture in
the old criminal records of this guy,

01:13:46.066 --> 01:13:50.003
I, I swear I've seen this guy
somewhere before, but I can't,

01:13:50.003 --> 01:13:54.374
- Oh, it's probably nothing,
- All right, See you in court, big boy,

01:13:54.374 --> 01:13:57.137
Hey, I am a big boy,

01:13:58.512 --> 01:14:02.349
- That is sexual harassment, young man,
- Ha! You wish,

01:14:02.349 --> 01:14:04.618
- Bye,
- Be safe,

01:14:04.618 --> 01:14:05.952
Yeah.

01:14:05.952 --> 01:14:09.887
All rise,
The Honorable Helen Lewis presiding,

01:14:14.261 --> 01:14:16.897
You may be seated,

01:14:16.897 --> 01:14:19.666
I understand you have
a request, Mr, Kern,

01:14:19.666 --> 01:14:24.104
- Yes, Your Honor,
- Counsel may approach the bench,

01:14:24.104 --> 01:14:27.274
Your Honor,
Detective Baker is here now,

01:14:27.274 --> 01:14:29.509
Rather than have him stay here
waiting to testify,

01:14:29.509 --> 01:14:31.811
the People request he
be placed on a two-hour call,

01:14:31.811 --> 01:14:34.748
Mr, Locket,
is that agreeable with you?

01:14:34.748 --> 01:14:37.682
Can I decide on this, uh, later?

01:14:39.019 --> 01:14:43.890
Mr, Locket, I say we
pick up where we left off,

01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:45.392
Yes,

01:14:45.392 --> 01:14:49.396
- Just call your next witness, Mr, Locket,
- Let's go,

01:14:49.396 --> 01:14:52.599
- Thank you, Your Honor,
-  Thank you, Your Honor,

01:14:52.599 --> 01:14:55.235
- Yes, it looked suspicious,
- Mm-hm,

01:14:55.235 --> 01:14:59.102
Mr, Greenspan's actions
were suspicious to me,

01:15:00.207 --> 01:15:02.742
How long have you
been with the department?

01:15:02.742 --> 01:15:04.177
At that time, eight months,

01:15:04.177 --> 01:15:07.080
And in eight months,
you had become a homicide expert,

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:11.751
And in spite of Sergeant Baker's 20 years'
experience, you felt he was wrong,

01:15:11.751 --> 01:15:15.522
- Yes, I felt he was wrong,
- You became an expert that night?

01:15:15.522 --> 01:15:19.092
I became aware that
Mr, Greenspan's statements and actions

01:15:19.092 --> 01:15:22.095
were inconsistent with the facts,

01:15:22.095 --> 01:15:25.098
- In only eight months,
- Yes!

01:15:25.098 --> 01:15:27.334
It was obvious,

01:15:27.334 --> 01:15:29.597
No further questions,

01:15:32.839 --> 01:15:38.845
Deputy Fields, before you joined the
sheriff's department, didn't you study law?

01:15:38.845 --> 01:15:40.547
I practiced law in Minnesota,

01:15:40.547 --> 01:15:43.917
and decided to move to California
to study for the bar,

01:15:43.917 --> 01:15:47.654
In the meantime,
I joined the sheriff's department,

01:15:47.654 --> 01:15:49.856
It starts off paying very well,

01:15:49.856 --> 01:15:52.790
Thank you,
No more questions,

01:16:38.338 --> 01:16:44.878
Deputy Foster, is there any reason
Detective Baker would say you're lying?

01:16:44.878 --> 01:16:49.049
Yes, Baker, and Massey,

01:16:49.049 --> 01:16:51.985
wanted me to go along with
the official line on the Ernie Marshall case,

01:16:51.985 --> 01:16:55.021
I object, Your Honor,
Move to strike that response,

01:16:55.021 --> 01:16:59.526
Deputy Foster was a witness
who testified he knew nothing at the time,

01:16:59.526 --> 01:17:02.653
Will counsel approach the bench?

01:17:04.230 --> 01:17:07.133
We'll go off the record here,

01:17:07.133 --> 01:17:09.202
Mr, Locket, what case are you trying?

01:17:09.202 --> 01:17:11.871
Your Honor,
Chief Massey testified

01:17:11.871 --> 01:17:15.875
that Deputy Foster had a problem
because he had not been promoted,

01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:19.946
Well, the problem is
the department made him lie

01:17:19.946 --> 01:17:22.982
about the Ernie Marshall case,

01:17:22.982 --> 01:17:25.618
Well, then get to where
you're going with this, Mr, Locket,

01:17:25.618 --> 01:17:28.321
The Marshall case has
nothing to do with this case,

01:17:28.321 --> 01:17:30.890
Well, it seems that it does, Mr, Kern,

01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:33.693
Since you brought it up
in the presence of the jury,

01:17:33.693 --> 01:17:36.096
You may proceed with
your line of questioning, Mr, Locket,

01:17:36.096 --> 01:17:38.331
Thank you, Your Honor,

01:17:38.331 --> 01:17:43.063
Deputy Foster, is the department
covering up evidence?

01:17:44.671 --> 01:17:46.239
- Yes,
- Objection,

01:17:46.239 --> 01:17:48.208
The witness admits to
lying to the grand jury,

01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:50.410
and now he has
a different version of the truth,

01:17:50.410 --> 01:17:53.446
- Overruled,
- Deputy Foster,

01:17:53.446 --> 01:17:56.972
did Detective Baker ever threaten you?

01:17:58.184 --> 01:17:58.952
Yes,

01:17:58.952 --> 01:18:01.821
You were coached on
what to say in this case

01:18:01.821 --> 01:18:06.893
the way you were coached on what to say
in the Ernie Marshall case, isn't that so?

01:18:06.893 --> 01:18:08.661
Yes,

01:18:08.661 --> 01:18:13.633
Deputy, have you ever heard of
an organization in the department

01:18:13.633 --> 01:18:18.204
- known as "The Rough Riders"?
- Yes,

01:18:18.204 --> 01:18:20.974
It's a group of men that
formed around Baker and Hall,

01:18:20.974 --> 01:18:24.077
They're all transfers
from other stations,

01:18:24.077 --> 01:18:27.180
Men who had been cited
for excessive use of force,

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:29.082
- Objection, Hearsay,
- Overruled,

01:18:29.082 --> 01:18:32.819
Check their personnel folders,

01:18:32.819 --> 01:18:36.022
Your Honor, I have no further questions,
And, Deputy, thank you,

01:18:36.022 --> 01:18:38.425
Indeed,

01:18:38.425 --> 01:18:43.229
Isn't The Rough Riders a bowling team,
with Detective Baker as captain?

01:18:43.229 --> 01:18:48.256
- That's what they do on their off-hours,
- You didn't answer my question,

01:18:49.269 --> 01:18:53.973
Mr, Foster,
you lied to the grand jury,

01:18:53.973 --> 01:18:56.509
I was encouraged by the department

01:18:56.509 --> 01:19:00.046
to back up statements
made by Baker and Massey,

01:19:00.046 --> 01:19:02.673
But you lied,

01:19:03.783 --> 01:19:05.251
- You're a liar,
-  Mr, Kern,

01:19:05.251 --> 01:19:06.686
- Objection, Your Honor,
- Sustained,

01:19:06.686 --> 01:19:08.421
Withdrawn,
Sorry, Your Honor,

01:19:08.421 --> 01:19:12.058
The jury will disregard
that last statement,

01:19:12.058 --> 01:19:15.929
I make mistakes,
but I always make two copies,

01:19:15.929 --> 01:19:18.631
The one I turn in
is always free of errors

01:19:18.631 --> 01:19:23.036
because Chief Massey's on my case
about the least little thing,

01:19:23.036 --> 01:19:27.472
This is not the gun you picked up
with Teddy Woods, is it?

01:19:31.578 --> 01:19:34.137
No,

01:19:37.317 --> 01:19:41.187
- Mr, Johnson, have you lied to this jury?
- What are you talking about?

01:19:41.187 --> 01:19:44.824
- Just a yes or no answer,
- No!

01:19:44.824 --> 01:19:48.452
I would like to recall this witness
at a later date,

01:19:56.269 --> 01:19:59.072
Who is this guy?
I've seen him before,

01:19:59.072 --> 01:20:01.374
Where'd you get that?

01:20:01.374 --> 01:20:03.637
You told me where to look,

01:20:07.213 --> 01:20:11.410
- You can ruin his career,
- Man, it's already ruined!

01:20:16.089 --> 01:20:20.184
Jay Livingston,
head of Business Affairs,

01:20:24.464 --> 01:20:26.599
He's booked under "James Drake,"

01:20:26.599 --> 01:20:31.471
You're telling me he's the one
that keeps picking up minors?

01:20:31.471 --> 01:20:35.608
Chief Massey, you've served
the department for over 30 years,

01:20:35.608 --> 01:20:37.877
the last ten years as chief,

01:20:37.877 --> 01:20:40.647
And you've received
numerous citations and awards,

01:20:40.647 --> 01:20:43.283
- Is that not so?
- That's correct,

01:20:43.283 --> 01:20:47.020
Did you ever tell Deputy Foster
what to say to the grand jury?

01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:49.289
No, sir,

01:20:49.289 --> 01:20:52.559
What's your evaluation
of Deputy Johnson?

01:20:52.559 --> 01:20:54.661
In my opinion?

01:20:54.661 --> 01:20:57.063
He never would have
made the department,

01:20:57.063 --> 01:21:00.233
if the city council
hadn't made a special case

01:21:00.233 --> 01:21:03.258
of getting him into the department,

01:21:12.445 --> 01:21:15.949
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you
have heard both sides of the argument,

01:21:15.949 --> 01:21:21.087
As jurors, it is your duty to determine
the effect and value of the evidence,

01:21:21.087 --> 01:21:23.957
and to decide
all questions of fact,

01:21:23.957 --> 01:21:28.655
You must not be influenced
by sympathy, prejudice or passion,

01:21:31.731 --> 01:21:34.300
It is your duty to follow the law.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:37.570
You are instructed
to bring in a verdict,

01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:40.740
- Here comes the chief,
- Everybody, get ready,

01:21:42.675 --> 01:21:45.478
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

01:21:45.478 --> 01:21:47.847
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

01:21:47.847 --> 01:21:54.053
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

01:21:54.053 --> 01:21:56.789
♪ Which nobody can deny ♪

01:21:56.789 --> 01:21:58.779
Happy birthday!

01:22:00.059 --> 01:22:02.729
Speech!

01:22:02.729 --> 01:22:06.599
- Now, whose idea was this?
-  It was all of us, Chief,

01:22:06.599 --> 01:22:09.636
Look at that - a vanilla cake,
How did you know I like vanilla, huh?

01:22:09.636 --> 01:22:12.639
We hired a private investigator,

01:22:12.639 --> 01:22:14.741
He also told us that
you like deep-sea fishing,

01:22:14.741 --> 01:22:18.344
so we all got together
and we got you this rod and reel,

01:22:19.812 --> 01:22:24.217
- So, what'd you get him?
-  That's for deep-sea fishin',

01:22:24.217 --> 01:22:26.352
That's where the real men
go to fish,

01:22:26.352 --> 01:22:29.389
Not like that fly-fishing -
for ladies,

01:22:29.389 --> 01:22:33.791
Well, I'II, uh,
I'll catch a big marlin with this one,

01:22:49.909 --> 01:22:52.011
Thank you,

01:22:52.011 --> 01:22:54.001
Happy birthday,

01:23:00.253 --> 01:23:03.790
No luck with those license plates,

01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:06.781
I tried every possible combination,

01:23:27.847 --> 01:23:31.077
Has the jury reached a decision?

01:23:48.201 --> 01:23:50.803
The jury was not able
to reach a verdict,

01:23:55.942 --> 01:23:57.932
How could that be?

01:24:02.281 --> 01:24:04.050
We can't go through another trial,

01:24:04.050 --> 01:24:05.618
Don't you know somebody
in the D, A,'s Office?

01:24:05.618 --> 01:24:07.186
What for?
They're not happy with the case,

01:24:07.186 --> 01:24:09.622
The Greenspan family wants money
from the insurance company,

01:24:09.622 --> 01:24:11.858
The insurance company
is feeding the D, A, a lot of bull,

01:24:11.858 --> 01:24:14.227
I don't want this ship to sink,

01:24:14.227 --> 01:24:16.896
- You know how to swim, don't ya?
- No time for jokes, pal,

01:24:16.896 --> 01:24:20.666
I'm not laughing, They will believe
anything you tell them,

01:24:20.666 --> 01:24:23.099
Jesus, What now?

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:40.052
All right, that's enough,
Come on, knock it off,

01:24:40.052 --> 01:24:42.255
All right, knock it off!

01:24:42.255 --> 01:24:44.950
I said hold it!
Break it up!

01:24:46.592 --> 01:24:49.495
- Now, what happened here?
- I caught him puttin' a note on my locker!

01:24:49.495 --> 01:24:53.065
What are you talkin' about? I found a piece
of paper on the floor and thought it came,

01:24:53.065 --> 01:24:56.202
- You're a damn liar!
- Hold it,

01:24:56.202 --> 01:24:59.005
All right, let him go,
Come to my office, Johnson,

01:24:59.005 --> 01:24:59.698
Yeah? What?

01:25:03.409 --> 01:25:05.778
You have a problem, mister,
you come to me -

01:25:05.778 --> 01:25:07.780
you don't take the law
in your own hands,

01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.615
You are really becoming
a pain in the ass,

01:25:09.615 --> 01:25:11.951
I asked him what he was doing,
putting notes in my locker,

01:25:11.951 --> 01:25:14.053
He started calling me names
and pushing me around,

01:25:14.053 --> 01:25:16.122
Your attitude is wrong
for this department,

01:25:16.122 --> 01:25:17.690
You're damn right,
my attitude is wrong!

01:25:17.690 --> 01:25:18.991
I'm not gonna put up
with that garbage!

01:25:18.991 --> 01:25:21.561
Fighting is something
I will not have here,

01:25:21.561 --> 01:25:24.864
Now, you are assigned to a desk
until we look into this matter,

01:25:24.864 --> 01:25:26.165
- What?!
- I'll take care of Kurt,

01:25:26.165 --> 01:25:28.394
Now get the hell out of here,

01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:31.938
- I'm gonna appeal this,
- I don't care what you do,

01:25:31.938 --> 01:25:34.132
Yeah,

01:25:36.576 --> 01:25:39.679
But, of course, you're
not a member of the Harrington Club,

01:25:39.679 --> 01:25:44.717
No, I'm not, You see, the good old boys
only allowed us blacks to wait tables,

01:25:44.717 --> 01:25:48.721
But now and again
you'll see a rare minority as a guest,

01:25:48.721 --> 01:25:51.689
- But you are, Mr, Kern?
- Yes, I am,

01:25:53.059 --> 01:25:56.829
- And are you a member, Judge?
- My husband was once,

01:25:56.829 --> 01:26:00.821
One day he took our adopted son
with him to the club,

01:26:02.635 --> 01:26:05.000
It was a painful experience,

01:26:06.539 --> 01:26:09.575
We've decided
it's in the best interest of the city

01:26:09.575 --> 01:26:12.712
to drop the murder charge
and not pursue another lengthy trial,

01:26:12.712 --> 01:26:14.280
Isn't there evidence
to prosecute?

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.883
Oh, yes, We still believe
Teddy Woods killed Mrs, Greenspan,

01:26:16.883 --> 01:26:20.887
Then take the case to court,
Mr, Locket?

01:26:20.887 --> 01:26:23.923
Well, I think it would best serve
the city and Mr, Woods,

01:26:23.923 --> 01:26:27.159
yes, if the case went to trial,

01:26:27.159 --> 01:26:29.662
Are you going to ask
for a jury trial?

01:26:29.662 --> 01:26:33.062
- Are you going to be the judge?
- Yes,

01:26:51.284 --> 01:26:53.886
This is car 7-8
requesting a tow truck,

01:26:53.886 --> 01:26:56.188
I'm just north of the inter,

01:26:56.188 --> 01:26:59.725
First she has to have
a nose job. But then she doesn't like men.

01:26:59.725 --> 01:27:01.160
Then why all the trouble?

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.730
Say, Bob, did I detect
a slight lisp in your voice?

01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:07.733
Oh, Stevie,
I didn't think you'd notice, big boy.

01:27:07.733 --> 01:27:09.723
Would you like to meet me
in an alley?

01:27:10.636 --> 01:27:14.093
I'm getting back
into law, soon,

01:27:15.207 --> 01:27:20.079
You know, when I was a kid, this was
the only thing I ever dreamed about being,

01:27:20.079 --> 01:27:24.412
Trooper, you're supposed
to become chief, remember?

01:27:25.418 --> 01:27:29.855
I just want to last long enough
to get a pension and get out,

01:27:29.855 --> 01:27:32.959
- Yeah,
- It's too crazy out there,

01:27:32.959 --> 01:27:34.949
Let's go,

01:27:37.096 --> 01:27:39.996
- Let's get high,
- What?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.601
No, no, I mean...

01:27:42.601 --> 01:27:46.038
The "11," On the license plate,
It's not an "11," it's an "H,"

01:27:46.038 --> 01:27:48.028
"Let's get high,"

01:28:53.506 --> 01:28:55.508
Hey, it's me!

01:28:55.508 --> 01:28:58.499
Deborah, what the hell
are you doing?

01:29:02.248 --> 01:29:05.651
- What is the matter with you?
- I'm a nervous wreck!

01:29:05.651 --> 01:29:09.588
Someone is
tapping my phone, I,

01:29:09.588 --> 01:29:11.724
- I don't know, I'm going crazy,
- Yeah, maybe,

01:29:11.724 --> 01:29:13.486
Thank you,

01:29:16.028 --> 01:29:19.622
This, is the file
we've been looking for,

01:29:20.399 --> 01:29:22.491
L-T-S-G-T-H,

01:29:25.371 --> 01:29:27.634
Councilman Reese's son,

01:29:31.243 --> 01:29:33.574
- I gotta go call Locket,
- Wait,

01:29:37.383 --> 01:29:39.850
Go ahead,

01:30:10.516 --> 01:30:12.779
Oh, man,
it's cold out there,

01:30:13.486 --> 01:30:16.215
- No answer,
-  God,

01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:23.254
I'm afraid to go to sleep,

01:30:25.564 --> 01:30:27.233
- I'll follow you home,
- No,

01:30:27.233 --> 01:30:29.001
No, huh?

01:30:29.001 --> 01:30:32.605
No, Don't worry,
I got this, right?

01:30:32.605 --> 01:30:34.673
I'll be fine,

01:30:34.673 --> 01:30:36.842
- Seriously,
- Call me if you need me,

01:30:36.842 --> 01:30:38.832
I'll call you,

01:30:40.412 --> 01:30:42.715
OK,

01:30:42.715 --> 01:30:45.274
Be safe,

01:30:54.293 --> 01:30:58.464
- That is Councilman Reese's son,
- Yeah, I know,

01:30:58.464 --> 01:31:00.966
He was involved in a hit-and-run,
and the department covered it up,

01:31:00.966 --> 01:31:02.227
Hmm,

01:31:03.602 --> 01:31:06.438
- You know him?
- Yeah, Business Affairs,

01:31:06.438 --> 01:31:09.341
That's one reason we couldn't get
the Commission to do anything

01:31:09.341 --> 01:31:11.544
about Ernie Marshall's death,

01:31:11.544 --> 01:31:14.569
Massey was pulling the strings,

01:31:23.956 --> 01:31:25.424
Hello,

01:31:25.424 --> 01:31:27.550
Hey, Foster,
What's up?

01:31:29.895 --> 01:31:31.885
What?

01:31:35.367 --> 01:31:37.698
That can't have happened,

01:32:08.067 --> 01:32:11.136
Next time, why don't you have your gang
jump on me like they jumped on Deborah?

01:32:11.136 --> 01:32:13.126
Huh?

01:32:16.408 --> 01:32:20.579
You're gonna shoot me now, huh?
Cold-blooded killer, right?

01:32:20.579 --> 01:32:23.749
Cold-blooded,
You got that right,

01:32:23.749 --> 01:32:27.286
I'll put a bullet in you,
blow you all over the walls,

01:32:27.286 --> 01:32:30.990
All right, that's it!
Johnson, out of here,

01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:33.359
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't worry about him, He can't shoot me,

01:32:33.359 --> 01:32:35.894
My hands aren't tied
behind my back, right, Bake?

01:32:35.894 --> 01:32:41.500
And if he does shoot you, I will testify
in a court of law that it was self-defense,

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:44.203
Self-defense?
I'm not carrying a gun,

01:32:44.203 --> 01:32:46.138
Oh, but I guess you can always
find a gun to plant on me,

01:32:46.138 --> 01:32:48.935
- You wanna try me? Huh?
- Hey!

01:32:50.409 --> 01:32:53.206
J.J., chill out, man,

01:32:59.485 --> 01:33:03.555
- Come on, J.J.!
- Get him off me!

01:33:03.555 --> 01:33:06.592
Break it!
Just relax!

01:33:06.592 --> 01:33:09.428
- Don't make me break it!
-  Jesus, Baker!

01:33:09.428 --> 01:33:12.521
Please, for God's sake!

01:33:14.767 --> 01:33:17.997
Don't be a fool,

01:33:23.342 --> 01:33:26.276
Now, give me the gun,

01:33:33.485 --> 01:33:36.088
Put him in a cell,

01:33:36.088 --> 01:33:39.579
- Come on, Come on,
- Don't, Don't, Don't!

01:33:55.574 --> 01:33:57.743
I have the right
to make a phone call,

01:33:57.743 --> 01:34:01.473
- You're not under arrest,
- Then let me out of here,

01:34:12.791 --> 01:34:15.486
What are you doin' here?

01:34:20.132 --> 01:34:25.404
Foster's downstairs in Booking,
tryin' to be some kind of a boy scout,

01:34:25.404 --> 01:34:28.907
We can't keep Johnson
locked up forever,

01:34:28.907 --> 01:34:30.897
I would,

01:34:33.846 --> 01:34:38.612
Chuck... Get Jack Bono in here,

01:34:55.667 --> 01:34:57.998
You brought your army,

01:35:00.806 --> 01:35:05.310
- What in the hell is this?
-  Police blackmail,

01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:09.948
Councilman Reese's son
was positively identified

01:35:09.948 --> 01:35:14.052
as the driver
of a hit-and-run vehicle,

01:35:14.052 --> 01:35:16.255
'Course, there were no charges,

01:35:16.255 --> 01:35:20.020
Councilman Reese is
on the Police Commission,

01:35:20.926 --> 01:35:24.897
Livingston here,
child molestation,

01:35:24.897 --> 01:35:26.887
No charges,

01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:31.470
I don't know
if this is true or not,

01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:34.573
You could ruin
these people's careers,

01:35:34.573 --> 01:35:37.743
You think about what you're doing
before you get involved in all this mess,

01:35:37.743 --> 01:35:41.380
I have thought about it, and you're
protecting the wrong group of people,

01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:43.449
- I know these people,
- Councilman,

01:35:43.449 --> 01:35:47.976
When I leave here,
I'm going straight to the newspapers,

01:35:56.929 --> 01:35:58.953
Get me the Attorney General's Office,

01:36:00.299 --> 01:36:03.035
Did you, um...

01:36:03.035 --> 01:36:05.204
get Massey's files to anybody?

01:36:05.204 --> 01:36:07.840
Locket and Reverend Banks,

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.002
- They're gonna take care of it,
- We got one,

01:36:12.678 --> 01:36:14.907
Just one,

01:36:17.349 --> 01:36:20.112
We should probably let her rest,

01:36:24.923 --> 01:36:28.026
- You take care of him,
- OK, I will,

01:36:28.026 --> 01:36:30.729
Yeah, We should go,

01:36:30.729 --> 01:36:32.662
- We'll see you,
- OK,

01:36:36.768 --> 01:36:39.634
- Get some rest,
-  See you later,

01:36:54.386 --> 01:37:00.722
It's a search warrant, The U, S, Attorney's
Office is seizing all our records,

01:37:01.727 --> 01:37:03.660
What?

01:37:16.074 --> 01:37:19.338
They just sit around
and watch paint dry,

01:37:25.851 --> 01:37:27.841
What's the matter?

01:37:44.336 --> 01:37:45.804
Dad,

01:37:45.804 --> 01:37:48.040
Mom,

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:53.612
Barbara and I decided that,
well, since I'm out of a job now,

01:37:53.612 --> 01:37:56.381
that we should...

01:37:56.381 --> 01:38:00.652
- go ahead and get married,
-  Well, congratulations!

01:38:00.652 --> 01:38:03.522
I knew you wouldn't let
your little brother outdo you,

01:38:03.522 --> 01:38:06.615
Who is that at this hour?

01:38:09.027 --> 01:38:12.431
- Johnny Johnson?
- No, I'm Harold Johnson,

01:38:12.431 --> 01:38:14.499
- Is Johnny Johnson here?
- Yes, he is,

01:38:14.499 --> 01:38:16.368
I'm his father,
Is there some kind of trouble?

01:38:16.368 --> 01:38:21.173
No problem, Mr, Johnson,
I'd like to speak to your son, please,

01:38:21.173 --> 01:38:24.209
- Is everything all right?
- Everything is fine, May I speak to him?

01:38:24.209 --> 01:38:27.045
- I hope you're happy,
- Oh, I am, You know I am,

01:38:27.045 --> 01:38:30.182
- Mm-hmm, I know you are,
-  J.J.!

01:38:30.182 --> 01:38:33.150
There's a marshal
at the door for you,

01:38:37.022 --> 01:38:39.591
- Are you Johnny Johnson?
- Yeah,

01:38:39.591 --> 01:38:41.793
Here's a date and time
to appear in court,

01:38:41.793 --> 01:38:44.317
Sign right here for me, please,

01:38:47.466 --> 01:38:50.559
- What did I do?
- Read what it says,

01:38:52.404 --> 01:38:55.374
J.J., you have been
charged by the government

01:38:55.374 --> 01:38:58.110
with violating
Teddy Woods' civil rights,

01:38:58.110 --> 01:39:00.178
under the color of authority,

01:39:00.178 --> 01:39:02.848
- Do you know what that means?
- I didn't violate anybody's civil rights,

01:39:02.848 --> 01:39:05.042
Then sit down and talk to us, J.J.

01:39:05.884 --> 01:39:07.052
Please,

01:39:07.052 --> 01:39:11.423
Mr, Bono said he stopped Teddy Woods
because he was a black male,

01:39:11.423 --> 01:39:15.560
Bono asked me to support
his report, which I did,

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:18.296
- You lied?
-  Baby,

01:39:18.296 --> 01:39:21.166
I was doin' what I thought
was right at the time,

01:39:21.166 --> 01:39:24.936
- I can't believe you did that,
- Barbara, I was a cop,

01:39:24.936 --> 01:39:27.768
I was thinkin' like a cop,

01:39:30.676 --> 01:39:33.478
- I'm sorry,
-  You said he had been stopped

01:39:33.478 --> 01:39:36.715
because he made a traffic violation,

01:39:36.715 --> 01:39:40.552
J.J., you lied
on the witness stand,

01:39:40.552 --> 01:39:42.721
The conclusion
from the internal investigation

01:39:42.721 --> 01:39:46.358
just has you
nailed to the floor, man,

01:39:46.358 --> 01:39:50.919
And Bono, because he cooperated,
has no charges,

01:39:55.734 --> 01:39:58.370
- Bono is in the clear?
- Yeah, he gave you up,

01:39:58.370 --> 01:40:01.600
So he was granted
immunity from prosecution,

01:40:20.892 --> 01:40:22.882
Stupid,

01:40:30.902 --> 01:40:34.393
Stupid, stupid, stupid,

01:40:48.587 --> 01:40:52.524
