WEBVTT

00:34.325 --> 00:37.412
Yeah. That was good.

00:37.662 --> 00:38.788
Oh!

00:39.914 --> 00:40.790
Ooh!

00:44.919 --> 00:46.671
That's what I like about wrestling.

00:46.880 --> 00:47.881
There aren't any rules.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.716
You can do anything to a guy,

00:49.924 --> 00:52.218
jump on him, stick him with a pin.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.888
The only limit is your imagination.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.474
Don't they have
any girl wrestlers in this game?

00:57.766 --> 01:00.894
No. But some of the older ones
have breasts.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.063
Connie, that was your mother
on the phone.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.023
She wants to make sure
you were doing homework.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.524
Am I in trouble?

01:06.775 --> 01:07.692
I don't think so.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.319
I told her you were busy

01:09.486 --> 01:11.321
wrestling with some word problems.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.531
Oh, Peggy...

01:13.615 --> 01:14.741
Thanks, Mrs. Hill.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.951
I guess I better start my math homework.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.704
Oh! That's got to hurt!

01:37.222 --> 01:38.056
Thanks.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.479
This is Hill.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.606

<i>Dust off your gym skirt, Peggy.</i>

01:46.606 --> 01:48.608
<i>We need a sub for girls' sports.</i>

01:48.608 --> 01:50.610
- Location?
<i>- Tom Landry Middle School.</i>

01:50.819 --> 01:52.320
- Duration?
<i>- Indefinite.</i>

01:52.487 --> 01:54.864
Did the previous instructor
leave a lesson plan

01:55.073 --> 01:56.407
calendar, notes on a post-it?

01:56.574 --> 01:58.993
<i>Well, that's sort of
a funny story, actually.</i>

01:59.160 --> 02:00.453
<i>See, there is no previous girls' coach.</i>

02:00.537 --> 02:04.290
<i>We sort of forgot to hire one.</i>

02:04.666 --> 02:05.750
Hm.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.294
So, where are you
stationed today, soldier?

02:08.545 --> 02:10.630
Fort mathematics?

02:10.797 --> 02:12.757
Today I'm teaching gym.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.801
Whoa, now, that's serious, Peggy.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.928
Gym is where a boy learns teamwork

02:16.928 --> 02:18.388
and the importance of winning.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.557
Actually, I'm teaching girls' gym.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.393
Oh. Oh, good luck to you.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.769
Do I have a clean shirt?

02:26.437 --> 02:28.773
Why choose basketball?

02:28.857 --> 02:30.567
Well, for one thing,

02:30.567 --> 02:33.862
it's the only sport
where you get to bounce a ball.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.822
- You bounce a football...

02:35.822 --> 02:37.198
Well, that's a fumble, isn't it?

02:37.615 --> 02:39.909
Baseball... no bouncing at all.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.744
Bounce a ball in hockey...

02:41.828 --> 02:43.997
That's a mandatory drug test right there.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.876
So, join the basketball team.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.544
Thank you.

02:57.969 --> 02:58.845
Cool.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.848
A little staged,
but it's still pretty good.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.727
Gentlemen, I'm not going
to try to win you over

03:05.727 --> 03:08.229
with a lot of fancy talk about bouncing.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.273
I just want you to know one thing,

03:10.773 --> 03:12.734
every kid who shows up to wrestle

03:12.942 --> 03:16.529
will earn a place on the team
and the right to wear this.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.741
Wow! Silver piping.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.785
- Good morning, class.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.078
I am Mrs. Peggy Hill

03:24.162 --> 03:25.371
or Coach Hill.

03:25.747 --> 03:29.542
Now, we are offering you girls
a special program which combines

03:29.626 --> 03:32.795
the thrills of wrestling
with the skills of basketball

03:33.046 --> 03:35.423
in something we call, general sports.

03:41.095 --> 03:42.263
Alright. Listen up!

03:42.931 --> 03:44.891
Go on.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.143
I want to start
by showing you a basic move

03:47.644 --> 03:48.895
and I need a volunteer.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.105
You there,

03:51.439 --> 03:52.440
just come at me.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.320
That's called a center-step,
single-leg attack.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.489
- Ow.
- Now what are you going to do, huh?

03:59.489 --> 04:00.740
Now what, big man?

04:00.949 --> 04:02.450
You going to dump me, huh?

04:02.659 --> 04:03.743
You going to pin me?

04:03.868 --> 04:05.828
This'll teach you to pull a knife on me!

04:06.120 --> 04:07.163
Hard to stab a guy

04:07.247 --> 04:09.040
when you're hopping around all day,
huh, Hoppy?

04:09.040 --> 04:10.124
Huh? What?

04:10.208 --> 04:11.125
All right. Good job.

04:13.544 --> 04:14.379
Hmm...

04:21.219 --> 04:22.387
I hear Eddie Tucker

04:22.512 --> 04:24.430
started patching his driveway.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.556
Yep.

04:25.682 --> 04:26.683
Mm-hmm.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.226
Where'd he get his asphalt?

04:28.226 --> 04:30.186
- Johnson's.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.481
Dad! Dad, guess what?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.066
I joined a team!

04:35.233 --> 04:36.359
A sports team?

04:36.359 --> 04:37.735
Uh-huh! Wrestling!

04:37.902 --> 04:39.988
It's the best sport ever, dad!

04:40.196 --> 04:41.322
There's no running!

04:41.531 --> 04:42.824
Way to go, boy!

04:42.824 --> 04:44.701
Wrestling's a darn fine sport.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.744
Heck, it's an Olympic sport.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.540
And this is offered
through the school, right?

04:50.665 --> 04:52.750
Not some guy in a van with a camcorder?

04:52.834 --> 04:53.918
It's the real thing.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.546
I'm in a very advanced weight class.

04:56.754 --> 04:57.839
You hear that, guys?

04:57.839 --> 05:01.426
Bobby made a school team today
without me even being the coach.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.720
Congratulations, Hank.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.263
BILL, DALE, AND BOOMHAUER: Whoo!

05:08.057 --> 05:09.392
What are you here for?

05:09.600 --> 05:10.810
Well, dooley,

05:10.977 --> 05:13.396
a pre-teen girl
is like a skinny little tree

05:13.396 --> 05:15.732
about to enter
the hurricane of adolescence.

05:16.107 --> 05:19.027
And if we don't protect
and nurture this little tree

05:19.360 --> 05:21.279
before you know it,
she'll be bitter and pregnant.

05:21.529 --> 05:22.405
For that reason

05:22.405 --> 05:23.614
I am asking the principal

05:23.698 --> 05:25.199
for new basketballs for the girls.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.202
I peed in some kid's locker.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.918
Girls' sports are a joke.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.964
Yeah, if I just jim-jangle
my schedule a bit,

05:40.048 --> 05:42.467
I think I can make it
to all of Bobby's practices.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.803
What a great time
in a boy's father's life.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.306
Hank, what if Bobby was a girl?

05:48.556 --> 05:50.099
Well, that's just it, Peggy.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.685
I don't think we have to worry
about that anymore.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.270
Do you know what that principal said

05:54.354 --> 05:56.397
when I asked for more
basketballs for the girls?

05:56.939 --> 05:58.566
He said that the money was earmarked

05:58.566 --> 05:59.901
to put holograms on tickets

05:59.901 --> 06:01.069
to the football games.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.780
Holograms prevent ticket fraud, Peggy.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.698
There's a lot of sick people out there.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.949
Well, it's just not fair.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.118
It's like nothing has changed
since I was a kid.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.134
Can you run as well as you can hit?

06:25.343 --> 06:26.386
Yes, sir. I sure can.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.429
Then run over to the store then

06:28.513 --> 06:30.139
and get these boys some soda pop.

06:30.306 --> 06:31.182
That a girl.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.603
Yeah, boys love soda pop.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.730
We got to remember to bring some

06:37.855 --> 06:38.981
to Bobby's practice.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.528
Looking good, son.

06:44.862 --> 06:45.780
You too, dad.

06:46.322 --> 06:49.158
Uh, I wanted to give you this
before practice.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.664
You know, you might not be here
if it weren't for this cup.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.125
It's made from the finest American steel

06:57.125 --> 06:59.043
ever to come out of Pittsburgh, P-A.

06:59.293 --> 07:00.378
This used to be mine

07:00.378 --> 07:02.338
and before that,
it was your grandfather's.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.132
There's holes in it.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.092
How am I supposed to drink out of this?

07:06.509 --> 07:08.845
Bobby, it's not for...

07:09.011 --> 07:10.012
Gotcha!

07:15.810 --> 07:17.103
Rhythm, girls!

07:17.478 --> 07:20.022
First you blow, then you throw.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.446
<i>♪ Hit 'em high ♪</i>

07:26.654 --> 07:27.697
<i>♪ Hit 'em low ♪</i>

07:28.281 --> 07:30.616
<i>♪ Landry, Landry, go, go, go! ♪</i>

07:31.576 --> 07:32.827
Good spirit, Hill.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.620
Can I have some Gatorade now?

07:34.871 --> 07:36.998
Sure, kid, you're sweating plenty.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.961
Hey, Connie, how's it going?

07:42.128 --> 07:43.045
Not so good.

07:44.589 --> 07:45.923
I just found out

07:46.007 --> 07:47.175
we're not getting uniforms.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.426
You're better off.

07:48.676 --> 07:51.679
We have home uniforms, away uniforms...

07:52.013 --> 07:53.264
It's so confusing.

07:53.681 --> 07:56.184
Uh-huh. Did you learn the pile driver yet?

07:56.392 --> 07:58.060
That's not really a wrestling move.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.563
Real wrestling is about holds.

08:01.105 --> 08:04.233
You got your headlocks,
your leg locks, your belly locks.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.527
If you got it, we'll lock it.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.529
Here, I'll show you.

08:09.822 --> 08:10.698
Cool.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.824
There's no way out.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.159
Try.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.410
Ugh. You mean, like that?

08:15.453 --> 08:18.247
No. You didn't use real wrestling.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.918
If you use wrestling,
it's impossible to get out.

08:22.793 --> 08:23.878
But good try.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.425
Hill, Doug here needs
some extra room to scrimmage

08:29.634 --> 08:32.136
so can you run a posture drill
or something?

08:32.386 --> 08:34.138
Get the girls against the wall?

08:34.555 --> 08:35.765
No. I'm afraid I cannot.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.017
I am teaching general sports here

08:38.017 --> 08:39.852
and I need a general area.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.270
Uh, yeah.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.106
General sports was something
Doug here came up with.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.359
It's like home economics.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.361
Sort of a code word for busywork.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.030
But the one thing general sports
was not meant to do,

08:51.030 --> 08:52.657
and Doug can back me up on this

08:52.865 --> 08:53.991
is take up space.

08:54.575 --> 08:57.787
Okay, then, I'm expanding my needs.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.122
General sports is now total sports

09:00.414 --> 09:02.667
and I need the whole gym
and all the equipment

09:02.875 --> 09:04.752
and Doug can back me up on that.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.471
It's over, Mrs. Hill.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.683
Maybe sports wasn't such a good idea.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.935
Maybe I should do yearbook instead

09:20.935 --> 09:21.852
or chess club.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.813
Connie, don't you say that.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.440
Yearbook is a shameful,
squalid waste of time.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.194
Now, you just tell me
what sport you want to play

09:30.528 --> 09:32.238
and I will make sure you play it.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.825
What if it's not a girls' sport?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.702
Oh, pooh! Honey, there is no such thing

09:37.702 --> 09:40.037
as boys' sports or girls' sports.
They're just sports.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.163
Then I want to wrestle.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.292
Well, then, we will show those coaches

09:44.292 --> 09:46.877
there's nothing a boy can do
that a girl can't.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.921
Go ahead, punch it!

09:58.639 --> 10:00.141
Look at that, pig-in-a-blanket.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.852
And my Bobby's the chef, not the wienie.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.731
All right, ladies, hit the showers.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.941
And no Oklahoma car washes neither.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.026
Get your hair wet.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.574
What are you doing here?

10:16.866 --> 10:19.076
Shouldn't you be teaching
the girls about their monthlies?

10:19.368 --> 10:20.745
Uh, no. Not today, coach.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.997
Today, I'm teaching a lesson in fairness.

10:23.372 --> 10:24.290
I have someone here

10:24.290 --> 10:26.083
who would like to join the wrestling team.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.836
And her name is Kahn
Souphanousinphone, Jr.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.588
Does she speak the English language?

10:30.588 --> 10:32.548
Well, of course, she speaks English.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.800
Well, then, tell her
wrestling's a boy's sport

10:34.884 --> 10:35.760
and that's final.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.803
Oh-oh-oh, no, it's not.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.513
Title nine of the civil rights act

10:39.597 --> 10:42.391
clearly prohibits sex discrimination
in public schools

10:42.516 --> 10:44.727
and guarantees
equal athletic opportunities

10:44.727 --> 10:46.103
for all boys and girls.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.105
Yeah, well, Roe V. Wade

10:48.189 --> 10:49.774
doesn't apply to my wrestling team.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.942
Oh, I think you'll find it does apply.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.319
Come on, Connie.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.613
Mrs. Hill, isn't Roe V. Wade...

10:55.613 --> 10:56.614
Yeah, I know, dear

10:56.614 --> 10:58.074
but you have to pick your battles.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.493
It was nice of you to come by Peggy Hill.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.911
And you can stay until you finish

11:01.911 --> 11:02.912
your zinfandel.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.413
But wrestling is a boy's sport.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.748
Connie might get hurt.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.626
Oh, boys are given the opportunity
to get hurt all the time.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.419
Connie deserves the same chance.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.338
If Connie going to get a workout

11:12.338 --> 11:13.464
it should be up here.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.007
Build mental toughness

11:15.299 --> 11:16.467
to get into good college.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.302
Hire former wrestlers
to pave her driveway.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.429
Dad, maybe being on the wrestling team

11:20.513 --> 11:21.931
can help me get into Harvard.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.849
Remember how disappointed you were

11:23.933 --> 11:25.101
with my application essay?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.478
You said my first draft
lacked life experience.

11:27.895 --> 11:28.771
She right.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.564
Connie play violin, sculpt with metal

11:30.648 --> 11:33.275
and speak three languages,
but what set her apart?

11:33.776 --> 11:36.570
I thought being smart person in Texas
set her apart.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.155
Maybe that not enough.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.116
I'm sure that wrestling

11:40.116 --> 11:41.784
will have a wonderful effect on Connie.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.869
Why, ever since my Bobby joined the team

11:43.953 --> 11:45.329
I've seen marked improvements

11:45.413 --> 11:47.581
in his social skills and in his balance.

11:47.748 --> 11:48.624
Wait a minute.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.127
- Bobby Hill is your son?
- Very good.

11:51.335 --> 11:54.213
You follow trail of clues
that start with same last name.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.298
Where you find this guy, Scotland yard?

11:56.674 --> 11:58.801
Now, Mr. Song-thong-is-sin-phone

11:58.801 --> 12:01.053
I'm, I'm sure there's a
simple solution to all of this.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.097
Perhaps you could persuade
your lovely little gal

12:03.222 --> 12:04.181
to take gymnastics.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.183
Asian girls usually excel at gymnastics.

12:06.517 --> 12:07.852
I mean, with their tiny feet

12:08.060 --> 12:09.687
a balance beam seems as wide
as a sidewalk.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.691
Kahn Jr., you want to take gymnastics?

12:14.066 --> 12:15.484
Gymnastics blows.

12:15.860 --> 12:16.777
You heard her.

12:16.861 --> 12:17.862
If my girl doesn't wrestle,

12:17.862 --> 12:19.530
I'll show you who put the sue

12:19.530 --> 12:20.573
in Souphanousinphone.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.826
Cherry is strictly
an after-wrestling Gatorade

12:24.160 --> 12:26.412
but lemon-lime is good anytime.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.330
All right, Tinkerbells, listen up.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.166
We got a situation here.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.544
The girls' gym sub
has got a bee in her bonnet

12:33.544 --> 12:35.087
about co-eding our team.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.923
Long story short, we got a gal on deck.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.136
I know, I know,
but there's nothing we can do.

12:42.470 --> 12:46.223
It all goes back to title nine,
Dick Nixon's biggest mistake.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.767
Now, I know I told you

12:47.767 --> 12:49.935
there's a place on this team
for all comers, but now...

12:51.312 --> 12:53.522
I'm not so sure everybody's
going to make the team.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.909
Hey, Bobby, did you hear?

13:05.075 --> 13:07.077
Your mom is going to get me
on the wrestling team.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.913
Now, we can hang out all afternoon

13:08.913 --> 13:11.040
and my mom won't care
'cause it's practice.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.041
Shh.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.960
I can't remember my combination
when you're talking.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.253
Okay.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.216
This could take a while.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.551
Oh. Okay.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.432
Mom made the coach take
Connie on the wrestling team

13:28.516 --> 13:29.934
and now he's out to get me.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.185
Oh, no.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.686
We were so close.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.272
It's all well and good to talk
about equal rights

13:35.356 --> 13:37.441
until some man loses his job.

13:37.775 --> 13:38.734
How's that equal?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.862
Yeah, and it's worse
when they take away our favors

13:41.946 --> 13:43.489
'cause we're used to getting them.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.199
Now, hold on, Hank.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.076
I'm all for ladies wrestling

13:47.451 --> 13:49.036
except when they do it in pudding.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.496
That's just demeaning

13:50.496 --> 13:52.414
to the human beings who make pudding.

13:52.623 --> 13:53.999
Ever since they had that

13:54.124 --> 13:56.710
big women's conference in Beijing

13:56.794 --> 13:59.338
coed sports has been
the number two priority

13:59.338 --> 14:01.882
on the international feminine agenda.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.344
You want to know
what the number one priority is?

14:05.719 --> 14:07.596
Please, not right now, Dale.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.223
Coed bathrooms.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.518
It'll be a cold day in hell

14:12.518 --> 14:14.979
before we institute that
in the Gribble home.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.025
Bobby was on the verge
of getting a nickname.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.819
I thought you were keeping busy

14:21.819 --> 14:24.905
teaching girls how to blow up basketballs.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.991
When did this turn into a desire

14:26.991 --> 14:28.242
to ruin wrestling?

14:28.242 --> 14:29.368
Oh, give me a break.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.620
I don't see why having a girl on
the team would ruin it.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.164
Did a woman judge ruin
the supreme court, huh?

14:34.248 --> 14:37.293
Yes. And that woman's
name was Earl Warren.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.545
Take a seat, debutantes.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.046
I got an announcement.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.132
Because of unprecedented interest

14:43.132 --> 14:44.466
in wrestling this year

14:44.758 --> 14:46.760
I've decided to hold tryouts on Friday.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.138
Instead of a guaranteed spot on the team

14:49.138 --> 14:51.515
this year, it will be based on ability.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.144
I know it isn't fair

14:55.269 --> 14:56.395
but apparently that's what

14:56.395 --> 14:58.230
some people like to call progress.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.398
First match.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.233
Keyser versus Gutierrez,

15:01.567 --> 15:03.193
Fino versus McJimsey,

15:03.444 --> 15:06.280
Souphanousinphone versus Hill.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.583
You got her into this, Peggy Hill.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.085
You can't abandon Connie now.
She need help.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.503
She need training.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.298
Oh, I want to, Minh. I feel responsible.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.091
Connie is picking up the softball bat

15:26.175 --> 15:27.927
that was ripped out of my hands as a girl

15:27.927 --> 15:29.762
by that little man from the little league.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.473
But then Bobby... Bobby's my only son.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.808
- I don't, I don't know if I could choose.
- Choose Connie.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.561
- But Bobby's my only...
- That not my problem. Choose Connie.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.271
Oh, what do I do?

15:39.521 --> 15:41.523
What do I do?

15:41.690 --> 15:42.816
Choose Connie.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.234
Choose Connie.

15:44.902 --> 15:48.614
Okay, we try outside the ankle breakdown.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.783
Luanne, try to stop me.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.161
Connie, you got the full color pen?
you take good note this time.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.671
Bill, for crying out loud.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.713
I was listening.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.924
Wrestling a girl.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.342
That's a tough one, Bobby.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.428
If you win, you get the shame
of having beat up a girl.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.807
If you lose, you just
better hope she snaps your neck.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.308
That's the quickest way.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.685
Yeah, man.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.937
Dang, dang if you do,
dang if you don't, man. Danged ol'.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.605
Dad, what am I going to do?

16:21.939 --> 16:23.148
I'm danged here.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.650
I'm royally danged.

16:28.028 --> 16:32.032
Now, the key to wrestling
is the ability to explode.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.575
The way I figure it

16:33.659 --> 16:35.619
if you can explode your way
out of underneath

16:35.828 --> 16:36.954
a piece of wet carpet

16:37.121 --> 16:39.623
you can beat any 12-year-old
in the county.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.333
All right, here we go.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.503
One, two, three.

16:44.628 --> 16:45.754
Explode.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.839
Explode, boy.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.174
Come on, Bobby, light the fuse.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.551
You're a keg of dynamite.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.178
That's it, boy.
You got him where you want him.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.766
Time to really explode.

16:59.810 --> 17:00.894
Keg of dynamite.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.943
Hey, Hill, a bunch of us decided

17:08.027 --> 17:10.654
that if you don't beat that girl tomorrow

17:10.738 --> 17:12.448
we don't know what we'll do.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.199
So you better beat her.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.286
Guys, there's no way I can lose.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.246
I'm in the best shape of my life.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.831
Hey, there she is.

17:21.915 --> 17:22.958
Watch this.

17:25.502 --> 17:29.006
How are you doing, Connie?

17:35.512 --> 17:38.057
Can we please just forget
I ever said anything

17:38.057 --> 17:39.641
about this stupid wrestling thing?

17:39.725 --> 17:40.559
What?

17:40.559 --> 17:43.437
No! I go out on a giant
limb for you, Kahn Jr.!

17:43.771 --> 17:45.939
You lose, you no longer my son!

17:56.241 --> 17:58.786
- Why don't you edit the yearbook, Peggy?

18:00.913 --> 18:03.791
You're so good
with paste and scissors, Peggy.

18:05.042 --> 18:05.959
Oh, yeah!

18:06.126 --> 18:07.795
Your arms are so strong.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.631
Why don't you stir-punch at the prom?

18:14.009 --> 18:15.385
Luanne!

18:15.928 --> 18:18.263
Quarters!

18:27.189 --> 18:29.483
I'm sorry, little Jeffrey.

18:29.733 --> 18:30.734
That's Bobby.

18:30.901 --> 18:31.860
Oh, yeah.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.321
I wanted to call him Jeffrey

18:34.822 --> 18:36.907
but some man wouldn't let me.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.283
You mean Uncle Hank?

18:46.041 --> 18:46.959
Huh?

19:06.103 --> 19:09.189
Remember
take old playmate down hard and fast.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.525
Mom capture everything on video camera

19:11.692 --> 19:13.193
include it in Harvard application.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.362
Dad, I'm not even in high school yet.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.447
And you never get there
with that attitude!

19:18.073 --> 19:19.116
You're next, Hill.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.909
I just wish your mom was here to see you.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.830
She wanted to be here,
but she had to sleep in.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.668
Son, I know everyone's
been filling your head

19:29.668 --> 19:31.128
with crazy stuff

19:31.879 --> 19:33.714
but I just want you to know this...

19:34.464 --> 19:36.258
Connie killed your frog.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.310
Atta boy, Bobby.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.979
Way to go, Kahn Jr.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.087
Ooh! Ow! Ow!

20:21.386 --> 20:23.138
What the heck is going on here?

20:23.388 --> 20:25.265
That's not Olympic-style wrestling.

20:25.682 --> 20:28.727
Nope. That's real wrestling.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.529
I want to go to a party school.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.323
Yeah! Chico state!

20:45.494 --> 20:46.411
Hee-yah!

20:52.000 --> 20:53.335
She zombified him.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.920
Snap out of it, Bobby.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.386
D-oh! That's got to hurt.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.054
Think they've had enough?

21:05.389 --> 21:06.640
Not yet.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.811
My eyes!

21:12.854 --> 21:14.064
Connie, no mercy!

21:14.064 --> 21:14.982
Finish him!

21:15.440 --> 21:16.608
Hee-yah!

21:24.408 --> 21:25.450
Why are you smiling?

21:26.034 --> 21:28.704
Oh, did Bobby crush
that poor girl and her dreams?

21:28.704 --> 21:29.621
Nope.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.373
So that little witch whooped my boy?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.375
No. They figured a way out.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.085
Listen to the cheers, Peggy.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.253
I think they both won.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.757
Oh, yeah!

21:41.466 --> 21:42.301
Ow.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.760
Look at him explode.

21:43.844 --> 21:44.845
That's my boy.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.221
That's our boy.

21:46.346 --> 21:47.472
That's our Jeffrey.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.222
<i>Oh! That's got to hurt.</i>
