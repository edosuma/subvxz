00:02.230 --> 00:04.059
I can't believe
that termite's doing business

00:04.070 --> 00:05.100
in my territory again.

00:05.100 --> 00:08.070
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

00:08.070 --> 00:11.270
I must not have explained it to
him clear enough the first time.

00:11.270 --> 00:13.470
When you say "explain,"
you talking about the time

00:13.480 --> 00:15.340
you put the snake
in his house?

00:15.340 --> 00:18.180
TRIVETTE:
I said <i> someone</i>
put the snake, not me.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.180
Right.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.280
All right,
what are we gonna do?

00:21.280 --> 00:23.350
We're gonna climb down.

00:23.350 --> 00:25.890
No, wait, wait.
I got the plan.

00:25.890 --> 00:27.420
What plan?

00:27.420 --> 00:30.660
We're gonna push this boulder
down the hill with your truck.

00:30.660 --> 00:33.460
Yeah, that way, we'll give them
a bang for their buck, man.

00:33.460 --> 00:35.300
Won't work.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.700
What do you mean, it won't work?

00:37.700 --> 00:39.900
See, that's what I mean by,
"You never listen to me."

00:39.900 --> 00:42.140
You're too stubborn.

00:42.140 --> 00:44.840
It will too work.

00:52.050 --> 00:53.310
( engine starts )

00:57.750 --> 00:59.590
All right, come on, baby.

01:00.420 --> 01:01.960
( engine revs )

01:01.960 --> 01:04.190
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

01:06.660 --> 01:08.600
Check this one out.
This is a beauty.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.300
I got three more
cases of these.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.630
But you gotta order now.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.370
( chuckling )

01:19.380 --> 01:21.810
Drop your guns, guys.

01:21.810 --> 01:23.310
Walker?

01:24.380 --> 01:26.050
Would you mind
tying them up, Cobalt?

01:26.050 --> 01:27.250
I'm a little tired.

01:27.250 --> 01:28.520
With what?

01:28.520 --> 01:30.380
Be creative.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.450
Belts. Belts.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.560
( wheels grinding )

01:42.570 --> 01:44.230
Come on!

01:52.870 --> 01:54.510
( cuffs clicking )

01:58.450 --> 02:00.410
Walker, here we come!

02:01.450 --> 02:03.080
Waaah!

02:03.790 --> 02:07.290
Woo-hoo! Here we come!

02:07.290 --> 02:08.820
Look out!

02:13.000 --> 02:14.390
( screaming )

02:15.430 --> 02:17.430
Baby, what a ride!

02:17.430 --> 02:19.770
I told you he was crazy.

02:19.770 --> 02:21.270
But determined.

02:25.910 --> 02:28.040
Told you
it wouldn't work.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.280
What do you mean?

02:29.280 --> 02:31.440
I'm a little late,
but it worked.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.920
No, it didn't.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.420
Yeah.
Where's the other guys?

02:36.420 --> 02:37.920
They ran off.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.890
Do you mind staying
with the guns and the money

02:39.890 --> 02:41.690
while I go chase
them down?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.990
Okay.

02:57.470 --> 02:59.640

( engine starts )

04:14.080 --> 04:15.550
Keep your hands
on the wheel!

04:15.550 --> 04:17.220
The hell I will.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.690
You just violated
the sanctuary.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.190
I don't care
what I'm violating.

04:22.190 --> 04:23.860
I'm getting my daughter, Emmi.

04:23.860 --> 04:25.460
GUARD:
There's no one here
by that name.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.530
That's a lie!
Go home!

04:26.530 --> 04:27.590
You're not wanted here.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.960
Not without Emmi.

04:31.370 --> 04:33.070
Stop that! That's my dad!

04:33.070 --> 04:34.130
All right,
let's go.

04:34.140 --> 04:35.540
It's all right.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.270
GUARD 1:
Everything's under control.

04:38.270 --> 04:39.910
Emmi.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.310
Oh, my God.

04:41.310 --> 04:43.510
You shouldn't
have come here, Daddy.

04:43.510 --> 04:46.450
I had to, baby.
I can't let you do this.

04:46.450 --> 04:48.380
I am old enough
to decide for myself.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.420
No, you're not.
You're still a child.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.690
I just turned 18.
I'm a woman now and--

04:53.690 --> 04:56.120
And I'm carryin'.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.460
That's all the more reason
for you to come home.

04:58.460 --> 05:01.090
MAN:
Damn to you who covets the lamb.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.160
She's chosen us now.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.730
A flower
that's come to seed.

05:06.730 --> 05:08.200
( Emmi giggles )

05:08.200 --> 05:10.600
I suggest
that you leave.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.740
We have her best
interests at heart.

05:12.740 --> 05:15.180
Is that why you put her out
on street corners, begging?

05:15.180 --> 05:16.910
Raising money
for the flock.

05:16.910 --> 05:19.110
It's God's work.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.820
What kind of church
do you call this?

05:22.820 --> 05:25.550
Guard towers? Razor wire?

05:25.550 --> 05:27.520
It's more like a prison to me.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.390
It's a haven of peace.

05:31.390 --> 05:34.190
Protecting us
from the beast.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.730
Outside is Satan's world
and here, it's clean.

05:36.730 --> 05:40.600
No crack. No HIV.
No rock'n'roll.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.340
And no freedom.

05:43.340 --> 05:45.370
I want my daughter back.

05:45.370 --> 05:47.070
She's just reached
her 18th year.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.780
Let it be her decision.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.140
Tell me, child.

05:51.150 --> 05:54.210
Do you wish to depart
with your father?

05:55.350 --> 05:57.380
No.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.150
I made up my mind.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.890
This is my home now.

06:08.630 --> 06:11.530
Go home, Daddy,
and forget about me.

06:11.530 --> 06:15.200
I'll pray for your soul.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.100
Emmi.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.810
No.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.310

Come on, now.

( people whispering )

06:31.620 --> 06:33.590
( elevator bell dings )

06:36.830 --> 06:39.090
Quiet. Here she comes.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.700
( woman giggles )

06:44.670 --> 06:47.600
ALL:
Surprise!

06:47.600 --> 06:49.670
Congratulations, hon.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.570
The even years
are always the best.

06:52.570 --> 06:55.440
Twenty-eight winters.
It's a good year to have babies.

06:56.810 --> 06:58.240
Happy birthday.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.480
Walker, whose idea
was this, anyway?

07:00.480 --> 07:01.750
Uh, it was Trivette's.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.150
You big fibber.
It was his.

07:03.150 --> 07:05.150
You've been so busy with
this Hansen murder trial--

07:05.150 --> 07:06.820
Yeah, we figured
if we didn't do something,

07:06.820 --> 07:08.790
you'd end up sticking a candle
in a cupcake at home.

07:08.790 --> 07:11.360
Yeah, the torrid nightlife
of the big city DA.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.530
You got my number.

07:12.530 --> 07:14.490
Oh, here.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.560
Oh...

07:17.770 --> 07:19.270
What is this?

07:19.270 --> 07:22.270
It belonged to Aunt Ruthie,
Uncle Ray's wife.

07:22.270 --> 07:23.900
It was her good-luck bracelet.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.470
That's Indian medicine.

07:25.470 --> 07:27.770
It'll bring you
love and happiness.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.980
Oh, it's beautiful.

07:30.980 --> 07:32.810
Oh.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.850
Thank you.
Mwah.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.580
All right, come on.
Make a wish.

07:38.590 --> 07:40.520
( hums )

07:44.090 --> 07:46.060
( laughing and cheering )

07:47.830 --> 07:49.430
What are you
smiling about?

07:49.430 --> 07:51.030
I'll bet I know
what you wished for.

07:53.570 --> 07:55.300
What I wished for
was my key witness

07:55.300 --> 07:56.540
who failed to show today.

07:56.540 --> 07:58.040
Why? What happened?

07:58.040 --> 07:59.370
He doesn't want to get involved.

07:59.370 --> 08:01.310
And all the marshals
were busy with other things.

08:01.310 --> 08:02.740
We'll serve that subpoena.

08:02.740 --> 08:04.240
Couldn't ask you
to do that.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.080
Okay.
What's the catch, Alex?

08:07.080 --> 08:08.510
Catch? No catch.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.520
It's just you guys have
more important things to do.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.350
It'll be a birthday present.
Who is he?

08:12.350 --> 08:14.490
His name is Luke Meggs.
He's a hog farmer.

08:14.490 --> 08:15.790
On the morning of the murder,

08:15.790 --> 08:18.260
he was out collecting swill
to feed his stock.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.360
He saw Hansen
run from the murder scene.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.930
Only now, he won't
come forward to testify.

08:22.930 --> 08:25.030
Okay, what is it
you're not telling us?

08:25.030 --> 08:26.570
What am I not telling you?

08:26.570 --> 08:28.030
That's what I'm afraid
to find out.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.240
Leave her alone. Why are you
always so suspicious of her?

08:30.240 --> 08:32.740
Thank you, Trivette,
for trusting me.

08:32.740 --> 08:34.409
Yeah, no problem.
Piece of cake.

08:34.409 --> 08:36.210
Okay, traitor.

08:36.210 --> 08:37.640
( giggles )

08:39.080 --> 08:40.950
I want some cake.

08:43.419 --> 08:45.520
I knew it.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.090
I wonder
which one's Meggs.

08:47.090 --> 08:48.350
I'll take
the little guy.

08:50.390 --> 08:51.890
Lute Meggs?

08:53.460 --> 08:55.330
We have a bench warrant

08:55.330 --> 08:56.830
which requires you
to appear in court

08:56.830 --> 08:59.470
to testify in the state's case
against Clyde Hansen.

08:59.470 --> 09:02.170
Man, like I told
them other four guys,

09:02.170 --> 09:04.800
I ain't testifying.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.940
BOTH:
Other four guys?

09:06.940 --> 09:08.510
You hear me?

09:08.510 --> 09:11.110
I ain't goin'
nowhere with you!

09:13.520 --> 09:15.150
Guess what?

09:15.150 --> 09:16.150
He ain't going with us?

09:16.150 --> 09:17.780
You got it.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.420
Hey.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.760
You know who we are?

09:25.760 --> 09:27.990
We're Texas Ran--

09:29.560 --> 09:31.530
Oh, man.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.800
I don't think
it's sinking in.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.040
We can do it
the hard way.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.480
Meggs, get down
from there!

09:45.480 --> 09:47.250
Uh-uh.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.420
No way, man.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.650
(<i> light comic theme playing</i> )

10:12.140 --> 10:14.040
Meggs,
get down from there.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.610
Get down.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.480
Do you got him?

10:20.480 --> 10:21.810
Do you got him?!

10:21.820 --> 10:23.550
I got him!
I'm cuffing him!

10:23.550 --> 10:25.820
Oh, man, his wrists
are too big.

10:25.820 --> 10:27.020
( both growling )

10:29.120 --> 10:30.960
( screaming )

10:35.300 --> 10:37.430
Stop! Let me go!

10:37.430 --> 10:38.530
Get his arm.

10:38.530 --> 10:40.000
I got it.
Okay. I got it.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.100
Stop. Let me go.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.570
Cuff him.

10:42.570 --> 10:44.570
( cuffs clicking )

10:44.570 --> 10:46.840
Let me go!
All right!

10:46.840 --> 10:48.210
Got him?
Yeah.

10:48.210 --> 10:51.510
Okay. Relax, Meggs.
Relax.

10:51.510 --> 10:54.680
Too suspicious, huh?

10:57.190 --> 10:58.620
Miss Cahill?

10:58.620 --> 11:00.320
I'm Hank Berrigan.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.090
You're the district
attorney, right?

11:02.090 --> 11:03.560
My God,
what happened to you?

11:03.560 --> 11:04.890
Come in.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.800
Then when her mom died,
Emmi just went wild.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.870
She wouldn't
listen to nothing.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.800
She wouldn't
listen to nobody.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.040
It-- It's like...

11:19.040 --> 11:22.180
sh-she blames me
for Laurie's death.

11:22.180 --> 11:25.150
Then she runs off
and joins this cult.

11:25.150 --> 11:27.110
Some sort of religious group?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.120
Oh, hell, that's just a cover.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.990
I mean, they call it
Heaven Compound,

11:32.990 --> 11:34.350
but this Deacon Bodie,

11:34.360 --> 11:36.390
he just uses people for begging.

11:36.390 --> 11:39.790
He uses women too.

11:39.790 --> 11:42.500
Emmi's pregnant.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.430
How old is she now?

11:44.430 --> 11:47.870
She's 18. I-I mean,
all the young women in there,

11:47.870 --> 11:49.400
he's got 'em all carrying.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.400
He runs the place
like a warlord.

11:51.410 --> 11:52.540
All the other people in there,

11:52.540 --> 11:54.070
they're all old,
except for the guards,

11:54.080 --> 11:55.340
and they're
just a bunch of cons.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.740
Mr. Berrigan,
I'd like to help you,

11:57.750 --> 12:00.250
but right now, I'm in the middle
of a murder trial.

12:00.250 --> 12:03.720
And besides,
you said yourself,

12:03.720 --> 12:04.980
legally, she's an adult.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.590
Ma'am, I-I wouldn't be here

12:07.590 --> 12:10.020
if I wasn't desperate.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.220
It's just that...

12:12.230 --> 12:14.390
I lost my wife...

12:14.400 --> 12:16.700
and I don't wanna
lose my daughter too.

12:16.700 --> 12:19.530
All right. I'll go out there

12:19.530 --> 12:20.830
and I'll see
if she'll talk to me.

12:22.300 --> 12:23.700
Thank you.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.740
( people chattering )

12:30.550 --> 12:32.750
Whew!

12:32.750 --> 12:34.180
What is that?

12:34.180 --> 12:36.150
Whoa!

12:36.150 --> 12:38.520
Where have you fellas been?

12:38.520 --> 12:40.720
You smell like
a packing house in July.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.190
It's not us, it's him.

12:46.260 --> 12:49.060
MAN:
Man, I gotta get outta here.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.430
MAN 2:
Ah, man, that's terrible!

12:50.430 --> 12:52.870
It's every dadgum
one of you.

12:52.870 --> 12:54.200
That's what it is.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.570
I'm gonna have
to burn these clothes, man.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.670
Where do you get the time
to eat Chinese food?

12:58.670 --> 13:02.040
Hey. I thought Rangers
were supposed to be tough, guys?

13:02.040 --> 13:04.280
Get us a fumigator, fellas.

13:04.280 --> 13:05.510
That's what we need most.

13:05.510 --> 13:08.810
You smell like you got a possum
under each arm.

13:12.450 --> 13:14.920
My best shirt.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.290
(<i> slow, mellow theme playing</i> )

13:31.710 --> 13:34.240
Excuse me,
but is this New Canaan?

13:34.240 --> 13:36.740
Yes. Are you looking
for Deacon John?

13:36.750 --> 13:38.110
No--

13:38.110 --> 13:40.850
The pretty ones always
come looking for him.

13:40.850 --> 13:43.480
Actually, I was looking
for Emmi Berrigan.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.890
( gunshots )

13:45.890 --> 13:47.920
( men shouting )
Hunters.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.120
I'll take you to Emmi.

13:55.860 --> 13:57.600
( machine gun fire )

14:02.800 --> 14:05.840
Have you lost it?
That's live ammo!

14:05.840 --> 14:07.910
Hey, how they gonna train
if their powder's dry?

14:07.910 --> 14:09.740
I want these men
to smell death.

14:09.740 --> 14:12.480
Come on,
keep down and rush!

14:13.650 --> 14:15.010
Got some trouble
on the compound.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.480
Some woman assistant DA
showed up.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.780
She's talking to Emmi.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.750
She breached the perimeter?
How did that happen?

14:19.750 --> 14:22.320
I don't know.
She wants to see you.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.890
Tell the men
to stand down.

14:23.890 --> 14:25.220
We'll finish
the exercise later.

14:25.230 --> 14:26.390
Come on.

14:26.390 --> 14:27.960
MAN:
All right. Stand down!

14:29.230 --> 14:31.230
Regroup!

14:31.230 --> 14:32.630
EMMI:
I am alive.

14:32.630 --> 14:35.130
( laughs )

14:35.140 --> 14:37.700
Oh! Isn't he just
to die for?

14:42.040 --> 14:45.380
Deacon, um,
this is Alex Cahill.

14:45.380 --> 14:46.980
Daddy sent her.

14:46.980 --> 14:50.550
And Alex,
this is Deacon John Bodie.

14:50.550 --> 14:52.250
What brings you here
to see Emmi?

14:52.250 --> 14:54.450
Actually, I'm here
on behalf of her father.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.860
He wants to press charges
for aggravated assault.

14:57.860 --> 15:00.860
Well, I assume you
have witnesses to prove that.

15:00.860 --> 15:02.600
You see, the way I saw it,

15:02.600 --> 15:04.930
Mr. Berrigan tripped
getting out of his car.

15:04.930 --> 15:07.270
Is that the way
it happened, Emmi?

15:07.270 --> 15:09.600
Look, Miss Cahill,

15:09.600 --> 15:11.300
I know my daddy
doesn't understand,

15:11.310 --> 15:13.710
but I don't want
any trouble.

15:13.710 --> 15:16.910
This is my home now.

15:16.910 --> 15:18.910
All right. Fine.

15:18.910 --> 15:20.980
I'll be happy
to leave.

15:20.980 --> 15:23.150
But first, I'd like
to talk to Emmi in private.

15:23.150 --> 15:25.180
( buzzer buzzes )

15:25.190 --> 15:27.150
Fine.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.420
( gate motor whirring )

15:28.420 --> 15:30.320
Inside the compound,
if you don't mind.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.130
Let go of me!

15:34.130 --> 15:35.560
BODIE:
Miss Cahill.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.060
He was only concerned
for your safety.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.660
Once that gate
locks down for the night,

15:38.670 --> 15:40.270
it gets charged
with 10,000 volts.

15:40.270 --> 15:41.940
So open it.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.270
It's on a timer.

15:43.270 --> 15:45.070
So when does it
open again?

15:45.070 --> 15:47.240
Six a.m.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.180
Spend the night in heaven,
Miss Cahill.

15:52.180 --> 15:54.180
I need to get to a phone.

15:54.180 --> 15:55.780
We have no phones
and no television.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.720
We have the Bible.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.790
I think you're
making a mistake.

16:06.790 --> 16:08.690
You're wrong
about the deacon, Alex.

16:08.700 --> 16:12.300
He loves me.
And he loves us all.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.200
You can go back now,
child.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.570
I'll see her out.

16:15.570 --> 16:17.500
But I wanted
to say goodbye to Alex--

16:17.510 --> 16:20.070
Ah-ah-ah.
Do what the deacon says.

16:20.070 --> 16:21.570
Sure.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.880
Well, take care, Alex.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.680
You too.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.780
Well, now.
You've had the night

16:30.790 --> 16:33.050
to talk with the girl.
Are you satisfied?

16:33.050 --> 16:35.590
Yes.

16:35.590 --> 16:39.090
Satisfied that you've
committed a felony.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.130
What are you
talking about?

16:41.130 --> 16:43.560
Statutory rape.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.930
Emmi just had her birthday.

16:44.930 --> 16:46.800
She's seven-months pregnant.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.800
She also told me about
the paramilitary drills,

16:48.800 --> 16:50.540
lack of sleep.
You're using mind control

16:50.540 --> 16:52.540
on Emmi and about
half the people here.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.340
It's a pity
you feel that way.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.710
What are you doing?

16:55.710 --> 16:57.240
Giving you
time to reflect.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.940
Are you crazy?
I'm a district attorney.

16:58.950 --> 17:00.210
This is kidnapping.

17:00.210 --> 17:02.580
Man's laws
pale in the eyes of God.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.119
( snaps fingers )

17:04.119 --> 17:05.480
Take her away.

17:05.490 --> 17:07.390
You can't do this!

17:07.390 --> 17:09.920
Oh, you'd be surprised
what I can do.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.160
Let's go. Come on.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.660
Hey, loosen up.
I said, I'm going.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.500
We're lucky the DA
got a continuance.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.800
But if Alex
doesn't show up soon,

17:18.800 --> 17:20.470
I know that judge
is gonna order a mistrial.

17:20.470 --> 17:21.900
It's not like Alex.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.300
She'd never
miss a court date.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.839
Especially this one.

17:24.839 --> 17:27.040
I called her apartment,
checked her office.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.540
Nobody's seen her
since yesterday.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.180
You heard Hansen swear
he wouldn't stand

17:30.180 --> 17:31.640
for a conviction.
Yeah.

17:31.650 --> 17:34.680
You think that now we got Meggs,
he'd make a move on Alex?

17:34.680 --> 17:37.150
He's killed three already,
and his gang's still at large.

17:37.150 --> 17:39.690
Let's get out
to her place.

17:39.690 --> 17:42.420
Fellas, be careful.
Let me hear from you, will ya?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.940
How'd you know
that was there?

18:04.950 --> 18:06.510
I've been over here
a few times.

18:06.510 --> 18:07.680
Oh.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.650
To discuss cases.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.220
Yeah.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.990
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

18:22.000 --> 18:23.900
God, Alex is neat.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.800
She's wearing
her bracelet.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.470
Then she was home
last night.

18:32.470 --> 18:34.110
Seems that way.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.880
( clicks )

18:37.880 --> 18:40.980
<i> Alex, this is Walker.</i>
<i> We got Meggs.</i>

18:40.980 --> 18:42.820
<i> Call me before court.</i>
( beeps )

18:42.820 --> 18:44.850
<i> Miss Cahill,</i>
<i> this is Hank Berrigan.</i>

18:44.850 --> 18:46.550
<i> Did you get back</i>
<i> from Decatur yet?</i>

18:46.550 --> 18:51.190
<i> What happened</i>
<i> out at the compound? 555-5736.</i>

18:51.190 --> 18:52.590
( beeps )

18:52.590 --> 18:55.330
Who's Hank Berrigan?
What's the compound?

18:55.330 --> 18:58.530
It could be that religious cult
down in Decatur.

18:58.530 --> 19:00.530
Let's call him.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.970
555-5736.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.210
What the hell
are you doing?

19:09.210 --> 19:11.110
You locked up
that DA?

19:11.110 --> 19:13.380
Damage control.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.010
She was gonna
file charges.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.320
Well, as your lawyer,

19:16.320 --> 19:18.250
I am telling you
to let her go now.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.190
Kidnapping
is a federal crime.

19:20.190 --> 19:21.790
We don't need
the feds out here.

19:21.790 --> 19:23.990
What's the difference?
Later, now.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.760
Confrontation's
inevitable.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.360
Hey, whoa!
Wait a minute!

19:27.360 --> 19:29.130
This is me
you're talking to. Remember?

19:29.130 --> 19:31.800
Bodie, I knew you
before you found Jesus

19:31.800 --> 19:33.630
and learned how
to shoot a Mac 10.

19:33.630 --> 19:34.930
Well, I get the feeling

19:34.940 --> 19:37.370
that you're not a true believer,
Brother Webber.

19:37.370 --> 19:38.770
Brother Webber?

19:38.770 --> 19:41.370
Look, when I signed
onto this,

19:41.380 --> 19:43.110
it was nice and tight.

19:43.110 --> 19:45.710
You held the Bible,
I kept the books.

19:45.710 --> 19:47.980
We roped in the old folks
for their savings,

19:47.980 --> 19:50.080
and the kids brought us
cash off the streets.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.550
1.2 million
that first year,

19:52.550 --> 19:54.590
and all of it tax-free.

19:54.590 --> 19:56.960
Donations and penance
from my brethren.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.820
Yeah, well,
your brethren,

19:58.830 --> 20:00.630
half of them
are knocked up now.

20:00.630 --> 20:03.260
And those mercs you brought in
are about to blow,

20:03.260 --> 20:04.630
especially Luther.

20:04.630 --> 20:06.800
I don't like him
and I don't trust him.

20:06.800 --> 20:10.140
Listen to me,
you disbarred hack.

20:10.140 --> 20:12.770
It is your soul that cries out
for redemption.

20:12.770 --> 20:14.610
And it is for the blessed,
like myself,

20:14.610 --> 20:16.510
to show you the way.

20:16.510 --> 20:18.480
The days of wrath
are coming, my friend,

20:18.480 --> 20:21.080
where the wicked shall burn
in the fires of Gehenna.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.350
But you have
nothing to fear.

20:23.350 --> 20:25.920
For the deacon
protects you.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.920
Okay, Bodie.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.630
And to put it in terms
that you can understand,

20:32.630 --> 20:35.090
we just brought in
10 more retirees.

20:35.100 --> 20:39.030
We are close
to 3 million, 6.

20:39.030 --> 20:42.330
If that DA wants to shut down
our escrow accounts,

20:42.340 --> 20:43.600
she can.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.140
Now, we don't
want that, do we?

20:47.810 --> 20:51.540
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

20:54.420 --> 20:57.320
I can see why Berrigan
was so spooked.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.780
This Deacon John Bodie

20:58.790 --> 21:00.350
must think he's
Lord of the Flies, man.

21:00.350 --> 21:02.650
Did you run him
through NCIC?

21:02.660 --> 21:04.360
Yeah, but "Bodie"
must be an alias,

21:04.360 --> 21:05.620
'cause I got zip.

21:05.630 --> 21:07.230
GUARD:
Hey. Hold it right there.

21:07.230 --> 21:08.690
What's your business
here, Ranger?

21:08.700 --> 21:11.360
Intruders outside
the main gate.

21:11.370 --> 21:14.670
Roger. We got
lockdown in here.

21:14.670 --> 21:16.400
You stay there.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.170
( buzzes )

21:25.980 --> 21:28.150
No!

21:28.150 --> 21:30.450
Let me outta here!

21:30.450 --> 21:32.620
That looks
like our boy.

21:40.260 --> 21:42.190
Rangers.
See what I'm telling you?

21:42.200 --> 21:43.960
It's high voltage.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.370
What can we
do for you?

21:48.370 --> 21:50.470
An assistant district attorney,
Alex Cahill,

21:50.470 --> 21:51.740
was out here yesterday.

21:51.740 --> 21:53.910
She was visiting
an Emmi Berrigan.

21:53.910 --> 21:56.380
That's right, they spent
about an hour talking.

21:56.380 --> 21:59.610
Then Miss Cahill took
Emmi back to her father.

21:59.610 --> 22:00.850
Is there something wrong?

22:00.850 --> 22:02.680
Not if you don't
object to a search.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.420
Feel free to walk
the entire compound.

22:04.420 --> 22:05.750
There's just one thing.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.220
What's that?

22:07.220 --> 22:08.420
Because of the children,

22:08.420 --> 22:10.890
we ask that you keep
your weapons outside.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.730
Not a problem.

22:22.900 --> 22:26.340
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

22:26.340 --> 22:28.910
Hello.

22:28.910 --> 22:31.210
Has anybody
seen Emmi today?

22:31.210 --> 22:32.280
No.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.950
Emmi Berrigan?

22:33.950 --> 22:35.650
No.
Uh-uh.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.130
Hi. Excuse me,

22:54.140 --> 22:55.530
have you seen
this lady around here?

22:55.540 --> 22:57.470
Hm?

22:57.470 --> 23:00.270
Uh-uh.
I ain't see her.

23:00.270 --> 23:02.040
How 'bout you?

23:20.460 --> 23:23.960
Well, I hope you enjoyed
your day in heaven.

23:23.960 --> 23:27.070
Like I said,
nothing to hide.

23:27.070 --> 23:30.100
Right.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.680
Remember his face,
Luther.

23:39.680 --> 23:43.450
His is the face
of death and destruction.

23:43.450 --> 23:46.250
Hey, what's with you?
You never give up your gun.

23:46.250 --> 23:49.190
Bodie's fingerprints.

23:49.190 --> 23:51.120
Now we can run them

23:51.130 --> 23:52.830
and find out
who this guy really is.

23:52.830 --> 23:54.530
Yeah, and then what?

23:54.530 --> 23:55.930
Then we're gonna
get a warrant

23:55.930 --> 23:58.260
and tear this place apart,
piece by piece.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.500
WALKER:
She's in there.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.570
I know it.

24:17.250 --> 24:18.850
Hey.

24:18.850 --> 24:21.120
Fingerprints
came back from Athens.

24:21.120 --> 24:24.260
This Bodie's got a rap sheet
as thick as the Old Testament.

24:24.260 --> 24:27.190
Real name is
Dwayne Tyrell Blaine.

24:27.190 --> 24:30.400
Did time for armed robbery,
assault and rape.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.030
Did his last stretch
at Eglin

24:32.030 --> 24:34.700
for possession
of stolen weapons.

24:34.700 --> 24:36.540
So that's where he got
his old-time religion.

24:36.540 --> 24:39.000
Yeah. He's got a mail-order
doctor of divinity degree.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.440
Now, this guy, Morgan Webber,
was one of his cellmates.

24:41.440 --> 24:45.380
He's a disbarred attorney.
He did a nickel for fraud.

24:45.380 --> 24:49.350
Specialized in bilking old folks
out of their pensions.

24:49.350 --> 24:51.720
So now he's at New Canaan
pulling the same scam.

24:51.720 --> 24:52.980
Now, let me ask you something.

24:52.990 --> 24:55.450
You wanna hit
a fortified compound

24:55.460 --> 24:56.890
because of
a white-collar warrant?

24:56.890 --> 24:59.290
No. I wanna hit it
to get Alex outta there.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.730
Well, we don't know that
for sure.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.860
I know it for sure.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.660
Now, didn't you say

25:05.670 --> 25:07.930
that Bodie did time
for stolen weapons?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.540
Yeah.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.870
Look, I'm just telling ya,
cop or no cop,

25:14.880 --> 25:16.680
the guy put a damn snake
in my bed.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.740
And that's the end
of that little bedtime story.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.880
Cobalt.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.020
Yeah?

25:24.020 --> 25:25.350
Come here.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.850
Got a deal for ya.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.120
What do you want?

25:29.120 --> 25:30.760
There's a religious cult
out in Decatur

25:30.760 --> 25:32.790
run by a Deacon Bodie.

25:32.790 --> 25:34.330
Real name: Dwayne Blaine.

25:34.330 --> 25:35.960
I want you to go out there
and sell him guns.

25:35.960 --> 25:38.500
No way, man.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.970
If you do this, I'll have the DA

25:39.970 --> 25:41.130
drop all charges against you.

25:43.440 --> 25:44.440
( sighs )

25:44.440 --> 25:45.570
Look, no deal, okay?

25:45.570 --> 25:47.240
Look, I-I know that guy
from prison, right?

25:47.240 --> 25:48.410
He's nutso.

25:48.410 --> 25:50.080
There's no way
I'm going out there.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.140
Suit yourself.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.120
Naaaah! Get that maniac
outta here, okay?

25:57.120 --> 25:58.950
Look, I-I-I'm not telling
you nothing.

25:58.950 --> 26:00.620
Understand? Nothing!

26:00.620 --> 26:02.250
"N-O" spells "no,"
end of story,

26:02.260 --> 26:04.260
I ain't going
to the compound!

26:05.690 --> 26:08.060
BODIE:
The book says the day
is coming, my friends.

26:08.060 --> 26:10.100
Now, the apocalypse says

26:10.100 --> 26:14.530
that the beast
will come in many forms.

26:14.540 --> 26:15.670
MAN:
It's coming.

26:15.670 --> 26:18.370
He will wear the face
of four horsemen:

26:18.370 --> 26:19.710
Pestilence...

26:19.710 --> 26:21.540
disease...

26:21.540 --> 26:22.940
famine and war.

26:22.940 --> 26:24.440
MAN: Oh, yeah.
WOMAN: Amen.

26:24.450 --> 26:28.150
That is why we have drawn
in here behind these gates.

26:28.150 --> 26:29.280
For protection!

26:29.280 --> 26:30.680
ALL:
Amen.

26:30.680 --> 26:31.780
WOMAN:
Praise God!

26:31.790 --> 26:34.690
You are my children.

26:34.690 --> 26:37.690
You are my lambs.
Our flock

26:37.690 --> 26:39.190
<i> must continue to grow.</i>

26:39.190 --> 26:42.430
<i> We must welcome newcomers</i>
<i> and help all devotees,</i>

26:42.430 --> 26:44.430
showing them how to surrender

26:44.430 --> 26:48.370
their old,
ill-taught prejudices.

26:48.370 --> 26:50.470
ALL:
Amen.

26:50.470 --> 26:52.770
To accept...

26:52.770 --> 26:56.810
<i> and embrace the love</i>
<i> and totalness</i>

26:56.810 --> 26:59.440
<i> of being one with us.</i>

27:01.150 --> 27:03.120
Who is your father?

27:03.120 --> 27:05.120
CONGREGATION:
<i> You are.</i>

27:05.120 --> 27:07.920
Who loves you
more than your own?

27:07.920 --> 27:09.690
ALL:
You do!

27:20.670 --> 27:23.000
Alex?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.170
They told me
you weren't eating.

27:25.170 --> 27:28.040
I'll eat when
I'm on the outside.

27:29.740 --> 27:33.250
You know, I'd hoped
that my words today

27:33.250 --> 27:35.350
might be inspirational to you.

27:36.750 --> 27:39.120
Inspirational?

27:39.120 --> 27:42.890
You are the sickest human being
I have ever met.

27:42.890 --> 27:46.120
What you are doing to these
people is unconscionable.

27:47.630 --> 27:49.530
You know, Alex...

27:49.530 --> 27:52.730
frankly...

27:52.730 --> 27:55.500
your cynicism hurts me.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.800
Are you always
this difficult?

27:58.810 --> 28:02.210
Only when I'm being
held against my will.

28:02.210 --> 28:05.140
Well, restraints
can be lifted.

28:06.050 --> 28:07.880
( sighs )

28:07.880 --> 28:10.350
You know...

28:10.350 --> 28:13.120
we could use a strong
legal mind like yours

28:13.120 --> 28:14.920
here at New Canaan.

28:15.990 --> 28:18.590
So let me get
this straight.

28:18.590 --> 28:20.030
This is
a job interview.

28:21.430 --> 28:24.130
You know, lady,
you're bitter.

28:24.130 --> 28:26.200
Hell hath no fury, right?

28:27.170 --> 28:30.540
Oh, you wanna
know about hell.

28:30.540 --> 28:33.540
I'll teach you about hell.

28:33.540 --> 28:35.110
( gasps )

28:35.110 --> 28:37.240
If you don't
get with this program,

28:37.240 --> 28:39.780
I mean right now,

28:39.780 --> 28:43.020
I'm gonna send you there
real soon.

28:43.020 --> 28:45.550
You got me?

28:45.550 --> 28:48.020
Yes.

28:48.020 --> 28:49.490
I can't hear you.

28:49.490 --> 28:52.060
( weakly ):
Yes, yes, okay.

28:52.060 --> 28:53.960
Okay.

28:57.800 --> 29:00.230
( footsteps fade into distance )

29:00.230 --> 29:02.770
(<i> mournful theme playing</i> )

29:09.680 --> 29:11.280
Hold it right there!

29:11.280 --> 29:12.440
Easy, guys.

29:14.150 --> 29:15.580
Let's go.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.820
( alarm sounding )

29:21.220 --> 29:22.790
Walker!

29:35.040 --> 29:36.370
Walker!

29:46.380 --> 29:48.280
Walker!

30:07.030 --> 30:08.230
( buzzes )

30:15.680 --> 30:17.980
(<i> triumphant theme playing</i> )

30:22.450 --> 30:24.480
I love you.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.260
( metal gate clangs )

30:41.170 --> 30:43.070
No.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.680
TRIVETTE:
One, two, one, two.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.650
Sounds good.

30:55.350 --> 30:57.450
Stick that in there.

30:57.450 --> 30:59.650
Did you have to tape it
to my chest hairs?

30:59.650 --> 31:01.690
No.

31:01.690 --> 31:03.220
Button up.

31:03.220 --> 31:05.160
Jeez. S-S-So, what now?

31:05.160 --> 31:07.030
Do I just go in there
on foot, or what?

31:07.030 --> 31:08.230
Not a problem.

31:08.230 --> 31:10.230
Trivette, give him your keys.

31:10.230 --> 31:12.530
What? What about your truck?

31:12.530 --> 31:14.130
They've already seen my truck.

31:14.130 --> 31:15.470
Now, come on.

31:15.470 --> 31:17.270
Oh, man.

31:17.270 --> 31:20.310
Listen, if there's so much
as a scratch on my car,

31:20.310 --> 31:22.310
you're gonna be dead dog meat,
do you understand?

31:22.310 --> 31:24.280
Yes, sir.

31:27.380 --> 31:29.780
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

31:35.560 --> 31:38.690
Sorry, we're closed.

31:38.690 --> 31:41.190
Just tell Dwayne that--

31:41.190 --> 31:43.760
Tell Deacon Bodie
Cobalt's here.

31:43.760 --> 31:47.100
I got a Cobalt here.

32:16.130 --> 32:17.700
What are you doing here?

32:17.700 --> 32:19.830
Hey, Dwayne,
is that any way

32:19.830 --> 32:21.500
to say hi
to your old bud, huh?

32:21.500 --> 32:25.800
Lose the con talk.
I got something going on here.

32:25.810 --> 32:28.740
I'll ask you one more time.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.010
What are you doing here?

32:31.010 --> 32:33.380
I'm just trying to sell you
some more hardware, man.

32:33.380 --> 32:34.780
I-I got a new ship--

32:34.780 --> 32:37.420
Listen to me,
you little hemorrhoid.

32:37.420 --> 32:40.020
<i> I want you back in that car</i>
<i> and outta here.</i>

32:40.020 --> 32:41.950
Listen. No lie, man.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.960
I've got some really
high-tech artillery here.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.060
It's the best.
T-take a look, huh?

32:48.700 --> 32:50.390
In my office.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.400
( beeping )

32:59.970 --> 33:03.110
Hey, hey, Dwayne,
uh, you know what?

33:03.110 --> 33:04.940
I just remembered
I left something in the car.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.110
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

33:07.950 --> 33:09.710
What's the matter
with you?

33:09.720 --> 33:11.980
What, are you carrying?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.920
I don't allow guns
in my office.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.450
No, man, it's nothing
like that at all.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.290
Tell you the truth,
I haven't been feeling--

33:17.290 --> 33:18.860
He's gonna blow it.

33:18.860 --> 33:20.860
You know, little stomach
problems and everything.

33:20.860 --> 33:22.090
And I got something
in the car--

33:22.100 --> 33:24.500
Wait a minute, you little worm.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.300
He's gonna
find the wire.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.270
What are you wearing, huh?

33:33.740 --> 33:36.980
A wire?

33:36.980 --> 33:39.850
You're wearing a wire on me?

33:41.050 --> 33:43.220
It sure is.

33:43.220 --> 33:45.080
A wire!

33:45.090 --> 33:48.490
Get this cockroach
out of my face.

33:48.490 --> 33:50.760
I mean now!

33:50.760 --> 33:52.820
Dwayne, they were squeezing me
real bad, man.

33:52.830 --> 33:54.830
You know I'd never turn you over
on my own. I swear it.

33:56.530 --> 33:59.300
There's no swearing
allowed in here.

34:00.300 --> 34:01.500
Come on, Dwayne.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.200
Hey, man. You know me
better than that, man!

34:03.200 --> 34:04.900
We're bros, man!

34:08.139 --> 34:10.239
He's gotta go down, man.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.850
Let's think this out.

34:13.850 --> 34:15.610
( buzzes )

34:17.679 --> 34:20.550
What are you gonna do
with that, man? Huh?

34:20.550 --> 34:21.889
Oh, it's just
a little Q&A here

34:21.889 --> 34:24.860
with Luther, me...

34:24.860 --> 34:27.659
and I think you'll find
our style electrifying.

34:27.659 --> 34:29.460
Hey. Hey, man,
anything you wanna know.

34:29.460 --> 34:30.659
What can I tell ya, huh?

34:34.800 --> 34:36.900
How many are they?

34:36.900 --> 34:37.940
They're just two.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.270
( buzzes )
Aah! God!

34:41.270 --> 34:42.469
Don't do that, man.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.110
Please don't do that.
That hurts.

34:44.110 --> 34:45.340
How many?

34:45.350 --> 34:47.050
I swear to God, man,

34:47.050 --> 34:48.380
there's just
a couple of Rangers.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.780
They're all alone
in a pickup truck.

34:49.780 --> 34:53.020
They got a couple of .44s
and a riot gun. That's it.

34:53.620 --> 34:56.120
( sighs )

34:56.120 --> 34:58.220
How much do they know?

34:58.230 --> 35:00.730
They-- They think
you got that lady DA in here.

35:00.730 --> 35:02.530
You know, I don't think
they're sure about it,

35:02.530 --> 35:04.600
but I swear to God,
even if she was here,

35:04.600 --> 35:06.330
I was gonna put you
on to the wire, Dwayne.

35:06.330 --> 35:08.930
I was gonna jam 'em up.
Work a double-cross! I was!

35:08.940 --> 35:11.440
Cobalt. Cobalt, man, hey.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.110
Don't lie to me. Okay?

35:14.110 --> 35:17.810
See, cause I'm plugged
into the truth now.

35:17.810 --> 35:20.650
I see things.

35:20.650 --> 35:23.150
Hey, I can tell, man.
I can really tell that, Dwayne.

35:23.150 --> 35:25.350
And I wanna swear to you
on my mother's eyes,

35:25.350 --> 35:28.250
I would never give you up,
Dwayne, never, never.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.190
You better
be straight with me, man.

35:30.190 --> 35:32.690
Come on, man.
If you're not...

35:32.690 --> 35:35.690
you'll get the shock
of your life.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.160
(<i> menacing theme playing</i> )

35:44.340 --> 35:47.470
Okay, we got
Alex in there, Emmi,

35:47.470 --> 35:49.170
and three hostages now,

35:49.180 --> 35:50.680
if you wanna count Cobalt.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.440
Make that two.

35:54.010 --> 35:57.580
Looks like he's leaving
