WEBVTT

00:06.640 --> 00:09.710
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.743 --> 00:13.547
- JOE, I GOT YOUR TEXT. IS EVERYONE OKAY?
- YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.583
YOU 9-1-1'd ME. YOU DO KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS, RIGHT?

00:15.616 --> 00:17.751
IT MEANS YOU'LL HUSTLE UP AND
GET HOME WHEN I NEED YOU.

00:17.785 --> 00:21.089
I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A
CRITICAL BUDGET MEETING.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.990
9-1-1 IS FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.626
- YOUR NEW CABINET DOORS ARE HERE.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME SOONER?

00:25.659 --> 00:27.361
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN
A POLICE ESCORT!

00:27.395 --> 00:28.796
YIPPEE, CABINETS.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.166
WHAT ARE YOUR CLOTHES
DOING IN THE LIVING ROOM?

00:32.200 --> 00:35.002
I'M SORRY, YOU'RE RIGHT. THEY
SHOULD REALLY ALL BE IN MY ROOM.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.604
OH WAIT, I DON'T HAVE ONE.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.240
SPEAKING OF OTHER WAYS YOU
PERSONALLY INCONVENIENCE ME...

00:39.273 --> 00:41.275
- OH, PLEASE DO.
- YOU KNOW I WILL.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.444
...I WENT DOWN TO THE
DRUGSTORE FOR YOU TODAY.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.680
SORRY TO SAY, THEY DIDN'T HAVE
YOUR MAGIC LADY OINTMENT,

00:46.714 --> 00:49.483
BUT I DID GET YOU THIS.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.585
CURTIS GLADWELL?

00:51.619 --> 00:54.522
- I BROKE UP WITH HIM OVER A YEAR AGO.
- I KNOW, I KNOW,

00:54.555 --> 00:56.790
BUT I RAN INTO HIM TODAY AND HE
ASKED ME IF YOU WERE STILL SINGLE

00:56.824 --> 00:58.659
AND I SAID, YOU KNOW,
"OF COURSE SHE IS."

00:58.692 --> 01:00.694
I'M JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU, BURKE.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.596
WOW, JOE, THANK YOU SO MUCH

01:02.630 --> 01:04.298
FOR TAKING A PROACTIVE STANCE

01:04.332 --> 01:06.367
IN MY PERSONAL DATING LIFE,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.469
BUT, UH, JUST SHOW ME
THE FRICKIN' CABINETS.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.504
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.740
OKAY, HERE WE GO. GET READY.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.843
BE-FRICKIN'-HOLD. HUH?

01:18.078 --> 01:19.680
( gasps ) MY CABINETS.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.682
AREN'T THEY GREAT?

01:21.715 --> 01:23.351
I HATE THEM.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.355
NO. NO NO NO NO NO,
THEY'RE ALL WRONG.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.590
NO NO NO NO NO NO, THEY'RE
ALL EXACTLY RIGHT.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.292
NO, THESE ARE NOT THE
ONES I PICKED OUT.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.826
THESE ARE... LEO?

01:32.860 --> 01:34.695
THEY'RE THE EXACT
ONES YOU PICKED OUT.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.564
YOU DREW LITTLE
HEARTS AROUND THEM.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.266
YEAH, YOU DID. LOOK AT THAT.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.600
AND YOU WROTE SOMETHING
DOWN HERE TOO.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.436
WHAT DID YOU WRITE? "MR. AND MRS.
MEL CABINETS FOREVER."

01:42.470 --> 01:45.839
- SEE THAT?
- THESE PICTURES ARE NOT LIKE THOSE.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.108
OH, THAT HAPPENS.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.843
IT'S LIKE MY PHOTO
ON TOLEDO MATCH-UP.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.849
TRUST ME. I'VE SEEN MORE
DISAPPOINTED FACES THAN YOURS.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.587
THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER
CHOICES IN HERE.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.822
I DON'T BELIEVE THEM. I
DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THEM.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.857
OKAY. ALL RIGHT, LOOK...
THE BAD CATALOG IS GONE.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.726
OKAY? IT'LL NEVER HURT
ANYBODY EVER AGAIN.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.429
I TELL YOU WHAT: WHY DON'T WE JUST
RIP THESE CABINETS OUT, OKAY?

02:08.462 --> 02:11.265
AND WE CAN FIND YOU A
CABINET SPECIALIST.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.734
OH, I KNOW A GUY. I
GOT HIS CARD HERE...

02:13.767 --> 02:16.604
- SOMEWHERE.
- GREAT, OKAY. YOU WORK ON THAT.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.339
LOOK, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

02:18.372 --> 02:19.740
IS THAT WE KEEP THE
KITCHEN ON TRACK.

02:19.773 --> 02:20.841
BECAUSE THE KITCHEN
IS KING, ALL RIGHT?

02:20.874 --> 02:22.643
AND NICE CABINETS? THESE
ARE THE LINCHPIN.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.744
'CAUSE AS SOON AS THEY'RE DONE,

02:23.777 --> 02:26.380
THEN ALL THE KITCHEN CRAP
COMES BACK INTO THE KITCHEN,

02:26.414 --> 02:27.848
AND ALL THE LIVING ROOM CRAP
COMES BACK UP FROM DOWNSTAIRS...

02:27.881 --> 02:30.318
AND YOU CAN GO BACK TO
THAT LOVELY BASEMENT.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.620
YES. FINALLY WE WILL BE
BACK IN OUR OWN ROOMS.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.655
YEAH, NOT ON TOP OF
EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.858
YEAH, THANK GOD, 'CAUSE THE LAST PLACE
ON EARTH I WANNA BE IS ON TOP OF YOU.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.628
UGH. THAT'D BE MORE HORRIBLE
THAN THOSE CABINETS.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.464

03:08.822 --> 03:11.825
SO I GUESS THE FLOOR IS NOT
HURTING YOUR BACK ANYMORE?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.927
NO, I ACTUALLY STARTED USING

03:13.961 --> 03:16.697
THAT LITTLE MASSAGER THAT
YOU KEEP BY YOUR BED.

03:16.730 --> 03:17.798
OH?

03:17.831 --> 03:20.334
OH! THAT...

03:20.368 --> 03:22.536
IS EXACTLY WHAT THAT'S FOR.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.938
YEAH, WELL, I FEEL LIKE I
HAVEN'T SLEPT IN FOREVER.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.440
I MEAN, JOE GETS UP AT 5:00 A.M.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.409
AND DOES HIS 500 PUSH-UPS.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.210
I'M SURE HE DOESN'T DO 500.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.246
OH, YES HE DOES AND
HE COUNTS THEM OUT

03:32.280 --> 03:34.248
IN ITALIAN.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.950
DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL HAVE YOUR
OWN ROOM AGAIN VERY SOON.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.786
HERE, HAVE SOME COFFEE.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.721
IT'S LIKE CHEERLEADERS
IN YOUR BRAIN.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.824
CHUG IT, RYDER, I HAVE
TO GET TO SCHOOL EARLY.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.527
I HAVE A STUPID MEETING WITH
THE STUPID SPIRIT COMMITTEE

03:46.560 --> 03:48.762
THAT THE STUPID VICE
PRINCIPAL PUT ME ON.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.832
AH, THAT'S A LOT OF STUPID
TO BE IN CHARGE OF.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.867
THIS IS PUNISHMENT. I
DON'T WANT TO SERVE

03:53.901 --> 03:55.936
ON SOME RAH-RAH STUDENT
GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE

03:55.969 --> 03:57.971
WITH A BUNCH OF
GOOD-LOOKING POPULAR KIDS.

03:58.005 --> 04:01.342
WOW, I'M SURE THEY'RE SUPER-STOKED
ABOUT WORKING WITH YOU.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.843
FOR THE RECORD, THERE
IS NOTHING WRONG

04:02.876 --> 04:04.412
WITH GOOD-LOOKING
PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.515
GOVERNMENT CAN BE FISCALLY
SOUND AND ADORABLE.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.251
EH, IT'LL BE ALL THE
USUAL SUSPECTS...

04:11.285 --> 04:14.221
YOU KNOW, THE SUCK-UP KIDS WHO ARE
FACEBOOK FRIENDS WITH THE PRINCIPAL?

04:14.254 --> 04:17.425
LOOK, LENNOX, YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS
TRYING TO CHANGE THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER?

04:17.458 --> 04:19.327
WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS
COMMITTEE COULD BE

04:19.360 --> 04:22.496
YOUR CITY BUS THAT PULLS YOUR
SKATEBOARD OF SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS

04:22.530 --> 04:25.299
THROUGH THE CONGESTED STREETS
OF HIGH SCHOOL APATHY.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.968
THIS IS WHY I HAVE
SPEECHWRITERS.

04:28.001 --> 04:31.472
HEY, BURKE, THE ONE-MAN CABINET
SWAT TEAM HAS ARRIVED.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.873
COME ON IN HERE AND MEET HIM.

04:32.906 --> 04:36.344
JULES, HEY, I WANT YOU TO MEET
THE LADY OF THE HOUSE HERE

04:36.377 --> 04:38.646
AND I USE THE TERM
"HOUSE" LOOSELY.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.881
MEL BURKE MEET JULES D. SAWYER.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.850
( Australian accent ) THIS
HOUSE IS GONNA BE A BEAUT.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.486
- IT'S GOT GREAT BONES.
- HE'S FROM NEW JERSEY.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.490
LOOK, I'M COMING OFF A PRETTY
BAD CABINET EXPERIENCE.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.859
I DIDN'T GET WHAT I
THOUGHT I WAS GETTING

04:51.892 --> 04:54.462
( choked ) AND IT
ENDED PRETTY BADLY.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.798
WE DON'T HAVE TO RUSH
INTO ANYTHING HERE.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.467
WE CAN TAKE IT SLOW.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.034
YEAH, THAT'S FINE. SURE.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.904
AS LONG AS YOU GO SLOW AS
QUICK AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.340
ALL RIGHT, THERE HE IS. TELL
HIM WHAT YOU WANT. GO NOW.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.909
OKAY. UH, WELL, I'D LIKE
SOMETHING CONTEMPORARY,

05:08.942 --> 05:10.511
BUT, YOU KNOW, STILL CLASSIC.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.679
I WANT THE CABINETS TO LOOK...

05:11.712 --> 05:13.714
DON'T TELL ME HOW
THEY SHOULD LOOK.

05:13.747 --> 05:17.885
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME HOW
THEY SHOULD MAKE YOU FEEL.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.387
HOW THEY MAKE ME FEEL?

05:19.420 --> 05:21.054
WELL, I BET THERE'S
AN EMOTIONAL MEMORY,

05:21.088 --> 05:23.391
SOME TIME YOU WERE IN A
KITCHEN THAT SPOKE TO YOU.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.893
"PSST. HEY, MEL...

05:27.094 --> 05:29.430
I REALLY LIKE YOUR CANS.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.998
OF SOUP."

05:32.900 --> 05:35.736
I'M SORRY. I DON'T MEAN TO
DISRESPECT YOUR WHOLE PROCESS.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.372
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DO HAVE A
KITCHEN STORY, ACTUALLY.

05:38.406 --> 05:40.340
WHEN I WAS 16, MY PARENTS
TOOK ME TO PARIS

05:40.374 --> 05:42.976
AND WE WERE EATING
DINNER AT THIS BISTRO.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.978
IT USED TO BE A HOME AND
STILL HAD THAT FEEL.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.947
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.350
WHEN I WALK IN MY KITCHEN, I WANT TO
FEEL LIKE MY KITCHEN IS HUGGING ME.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.755
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, PAL.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.857
TELL YOU WHAT: I'M GONNA
LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.692
I HAVE TO RUN DOWN TO
THE HARDWARE STORE

05:58.726 --> 06:00.394
AND GRAB A COUPLE
MORE CANS OF PAINT

06:00.428 --> 06:02.430
AND PERHAPS A HAMMER
THAT WANTS TO HUG ME.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.434
OKAY, MEL. I'M GONNA
NEED A LITTLE MORE.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.069
WHEN YOU IMAGINE YOUR CABINETS,
WHAT MUSIC DO YOU HEAR?

06:09.102 --> 06:12.840
MUSIC? REALLY? FIRST
FEELINGS, NOW MUSIC?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.075
I NEED TO KNOW THE EMOTION
YOU'RE GOING FOR.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.478
IT'S MY PROCESS. JUST GO
WITH ME FOR A MINUTE.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.680
WELL, I COULD TELL YOU
WHAT THE WOOD LOOKS LIKE

06:19.713 --> 06:21.915
OR DESCRIBE THE GRAIN
OR THE FINISH,

06:21.949 --> 06:23.984
BUT YOU HONESTLY EXPECT
ME TO TELL YOU WHAT SONG

06:24.017 --> 06:25.986
I THINK MY CABINETS
ARE SING-ING?

06:27.020 --> 06:29.056
( vocalizing "CanCan" )

06:36.730 --> 06:39.399
HEY, JULES. WHAT ARE
YOU STILL DOING HERE?

06:39.433 --> 06:41.134
SHHH.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.975
NOW I KNOW THEY'RE
JUST SKETCHES, MEL,

06:48.008 --> 06:49.710
BUT ARE THEY SINGING TO YOU?

06:49.743 --> 06:52.913
OH, LIKE MICHAEL BUBLE.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.083
WOW, JULES, THESE ARE EXACTLY
THE CABINETS I WANTED.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.985
OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO GET MY HANDS

06:58.018 --> 06:59.853
ALL OVER THESE BAD BOYS.
( groans )

06:59.887 --> 07:02.122
PERFECT. IT'S SOLD.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.925
ALL RIGHT. SO GET GOING
WITH THE CARVEY-CARVEY.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.860
MORE SKETCHES? WHAT ARE THESE?

07:06.894 --> 07:08.829
OH THAT. THAT'S
JUST A NOTION I HAD

07:08.862 --> 07:10.898
FOR THAT EMPTY ROOM
ABOVE YOUR GARAGE.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.634
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT MAKING
THAT INTO AN OFFICE, RIGHT?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.503
- WELL, SOMEDAY.
- WHY NOT NOW?

07:15.536 --> 07:17.838
SKYLIGHT. COFFERED CEILINGS.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.907
CHERRY WOOD WINDOW SEAT.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.175
- IT'D BE YOUR OWN PRIVATE SANCTUARY.
- ( gasps )

07:22.209 --> 07:24.044
OH, I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED A SANCTUARY.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.446
YOU KNOW, THE SUMMER
AFTER WE WENT TO FRANCE,

07:26.480 --> 07:29.116
MY FAMILY AND I WENT TO GREECE
AND THERE WAS THIS MONASTERY...

07:29.149 --> 07:32.052
BURKE, BURKE, BURKE, BURKE.
COME ON BACK HERE TO AMERICA.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.087
ALL RIGHT? YOUR
COUNTRY NEEDS YOU.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.689
JUST STAY ON-TASK
IN THE KITCHEN.

07:35.723 --> 07:38.091
SO WHY DON'T YOU MAKE LIKE
YOUR MATES, THE KANGAROOS,

07:38.125 --> 07:40.160
AND HOP TO IT, OKAY?

07:40.193 --> 07:43.430
JOE, NEVER INSULT THE PEOPLE
WHO BROUGHT US "SHARK WEEK."

07:43.463 --> 07:47.034
LOOK, JULES, I WANT YOU
TO BUILD MY DREAM OFFICE.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.637
GO, MAKE MY LIFE PERFECT.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.672
I WON'T REST TILL
YOU'RE SATISFIED.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.541
OOH, I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.143
I'LL BE BACK IN THE MORNING
WITH A LOT MORE WOOD.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.145
WELL, I'LL BE WAITING.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.553
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
- WHAT?

08:05.586 --> 08:08.622
( mocking ) "I'LL BE WAITING."

08:08.656 --> 08:10.691
- I DIDN'T SAY IT LIKE THAT.
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.560
I ACTUALLY TONED DOWN
THE DESPERATION.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.061
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS,

08:14.094 --> 08:17.230
UNLESS FOR SOME TWISTED SICK
REASON YOU FEEL THREATENED.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.132
WHAT? NO. NOT AT ALL.
I'M JUST SAYIN'.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.968
HE'S TRYING TO WORK HIS WAY
INTO EVERY ROOM IN THIS HOUSE.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.169
IF THAT HAPPENS,
HE'LL NEVER LEAVE.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.171
I MEAN, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

08:24.204 --> 08:26.173
WELL, HE IS KINDA
EASY ON THE EYES

08:26.206 --> 08:29.042
AND NOT SO YAPPY ON THE EARS.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.078
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS, BURKE?
THIS IS JOB CREEP.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.981
CLASSIC JOB CREEP. THE
GUY'S ASKED TO DO ONE JOB

08:34.014 --> 08:37.818
- AND HE CREEPS HIS WAY INTO EVERYTHING ELSE.
- OH REALLY, JOB CREEPER?

08:37.851 --> 08:39.720
WOW, YEAH. YOU
STARTED AS MY NANNY,

08:39.753 --> 08:41.655
BUT THEN YOU BECAME MY
CONSTRUCTION MANAGER.

08:41.689 --> 08:44.625
NOW YOU'RE JUST THE SENIOR VICE
PRESIDENT OF PISSING-ME-OFF!

08:44.658 --> 08:46.660
REALLY?

08:46.694 --> 08:48.962
YOU'D THINK I'D HAVE A BETTER
PARKING SPOT THEN, BABY.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.169
OKAY, TEAM, BOBCAT SPIRIT
IS AT AN ALL-TIME LOW.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.806
THAT'S WHY THE
ADMINISTRATION ASKED US,

08:58.839 --> 09:01.174
THE SCHOOL OPINION-MAKERS...

09:01.208 --> 09:04.544
AND OTHERS... TO HELP.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.947
YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED, AIDAN?
COOL EVENTS.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.682
AND I'VE GOT THE
GREATEST ONE EVER.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.217
DRESS-UP FRIDAYS.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.621
I SO HEART DRESS-UP DAYS.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.924
WELL, WE ALL HEART
YOUR ENTHUSIASM.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.760
WE COULD DO DISCO DRESS-UP
DAY, '60s DRESS-UP DAY...

09:19.793 --> 09:23.731
- '70s DRESS-UP DAY.
- OOH OOH, '80s DRESS-UP DAY.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.066
WE'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF
DECADES BY THANKSGIVING.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.602
SEBASTIAN, DO YOU
HAVE ANY IDEAS?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.075
WHAT ABOUT YOU, LENNOX?

09:35.108 --> 09:37.110
I SEE YOU'VE WRITTEN

09:37.144 --> 09:39.246
"SHUT UP" ABOUT 100 TIMES
ON YOUR PAD THERE.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.151
WELL, UH, YEAH. I MEAN,
AS AWESOME AS IT IS

09:44.184 --> 09:45.819
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S IN
EVERYONE'S CLOSET...

09:45.853 --> 09:48.155
I HAVE A RED MICHAEL
JACKSON JACKET.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.258
...IT MIGHT ALSO BE COOL TO
FIND OUT WHAT'S IN THEIR MINDS.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.695
LIKE EVERY THURSDAY AT ASSEMBLY
WE COULD PUT UP A MICROPHONE

09:54.728 --> 09:56.730
WHERE STUDENTS CAN SAY
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.799
LIKE A FREEDOM MIC.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.200
OKAY.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.703
WHAT DO WE THINK
OF LENNOX'S IDEA?

10:04.271 --> 10:07.941
- ( gasps ) '90s DRESS-UP DAY!
- YES, THAT'S SO UNEXPECTED!

10:07.975 --> 10:12.279
OKAY, WELL, YOU GUYS SEEM TO
HAVE THIS ALL UNDER CONTROL,

10:12.312 --> 10:14.715
SO I'M JUST GONNA STEP
OUT FOR A MINUTE.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.216
AND NOT COME BACK.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.924
HEY, I GOT YOUR TEXT.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.126
OH HEY, I JUST NEED
YOU TO TAKE A GANDER

10:26.159 --> 10:27.895
AT SOMETHING AND SIGN OFF ON IT.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.963
WELL, I APPROVE.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.866
I HAVEN'T SHOWN
YOU ANYTHING YET.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.802
WELL, I GUESS I'M JUST
IN A BUYING MOOD.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.103
ALL RIGHT.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.839
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:38.872 --> 10:41.074
OH, THEY'RE PERFECT.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.246
I GUESS I'LL LET THE
ARTIST GET BACK TO WORK.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.817
HEY, I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO BREAK FOR LUNCH.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.685
I PACKED AN EXTRA SAMMIE.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.322
IT'S BUFFALO MOZZARELLA
AND HEIRLOOM TOMATO.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.826
THEY WERE GROWN IN MY BACKYARD...
THE TOMATOES, NOT THE BUFFALOES.

10:58.859 --> 11:02.129
OH, WELL, I GUESS I COULD STAY
FOR A SAMMIE WITH TOMATO.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.132
I'LL JUST, UH, CLEAR SOME
OF THIS MESS OUT OF HERE.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.204
WOW, YOU MANAGED TO MAKE
THAT LOOK VERY MACHO.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.275
CIABATTA OR BAGUETTE?
I MADE THEM MYSELF.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.110
WOW, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN'T MAKE?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.246
AND DOES YOUR GIRLFRIEND
KNOW HOW LUCKY SHE IS?

11:19.279 --> 11:21.214
AH. A GIRLFRIEND...

11:21.248 --> 11:23.917
THERE'S SOMETHING I
WISH I COULD BUILD.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.253
I ONCE BUILT A BOYFRIEND OUT OF PILLOWS.
( chuckles )

11:26.286 --> 11:28.255
I WAS 10. I WAS 10.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.327
MMM. MMM!

11:34.361 --> 11:37.464
OH, IT GETS BETTER.
TRY THIS OLIVE.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.100
MMM!

11:41.368 --> 11:43.871
HELLO. I'M HERE.

11:43.904 --> 11:47.074
BEEN HERE. LONGEST 30
SECONDS OF MY LIFE.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.978
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING HERE?
DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.445
LIKE YOUR MANNERS?

11:52.479 --> 11:55.015
( cell phone ringing )

11:57.951 --> 12:00.053
( groans ) MRS. WESTBURN.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.955
THIS WOMAN IS A TOTAL NIGHTMARE.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.924
WHY CAN'T ALL MY
CLIENTS BE LIKE YOU?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.896
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BOUNDARIES.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.397
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF
THE DAY, BURKE.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.932
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING HERE?

12:11.965 --> 12:14.868
WELL, JULES NEEDED ME TO
APPROVE THE CABINET DOORS.

12:14.902 --> 12:18.271
- OH REALLY? HOW COME HE DIDN'T CALL ME?
- THEY'RE MY DOORS.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.907
YEAH, BUT I'M THE
CONSTRUCTION MANAGER.

12:19.940 --> 12:20.908
THIS IS MY TERRITORY.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.409
- WHAT IS?
- YOU.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.812
NO, I MEAN YOUR HOUSE.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.380
I DON'T APPRECIATE ANOTHER
GUY JUST SWOOPING IN HERE

12:27.414 --> 12:29.249
AND SCREWING UP THE
CHAIN OF COMMAND.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.052
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
CHAIN OF COMMAND OR SCREWING.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.821
UP.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.056
GOOD, LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.361
OH MEL, I'M SO SORRY. THERE'S AN
EMERGENCY AT MRS. WESTBURN'S HOUSE.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.463
IT NEVER ENDS WITH HER.
BUT TOMORROW WE'LL HUDDLE

12:43.496 --> 12:45.432
OVER THOSE PLANS FOR YOUR
NEW OFFICE SANCTUARY.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.500
OH WELL, I LIKE TO CUDDLE...
HUDDLE.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.838
HURRY BACK.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.041
LEAVE ME ALONE.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.410
DON'T YOU SEE THE GAME
THIS GUY IS PLAYING HERE?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.880
COME ON! HE STRUTS AROUND THIS
PLACE WITH HIS GUNS A-BLAZING

12:59.913 --> 13:02.082
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE'S
MORE CABINETS BEING ORDERED.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.917
THAT IS NOT WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.352
LOOK, I'M GONNA SAY
SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT?

13:05.385 --> 13:07.821
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE IT, BUT
I'M GONNA SAY IT ANYWAY.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.290
WHAT KIND OF A GUY COMES TO WORK

13:10.323 --> 13:12.125
WEARING T-SHIRTS THAT TIGHT?

13:13.360 --> 13:14.995
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? MUSCLES
HANGING OUT EVERYWHERE?

13:15.028 --> 13:17.030
FRANKLY, IT'S GROSS, OKAY?

13:17.064 --> 13:20.067
CLEARLY, THE MAN IS JUST
OVERCOMPENSATING FOR SOMETHING.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.371
- YEAH, IT'S JUST SAD.
- IT IS.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.974
YOU'RE FALLING FOR
HIM, AREN'T YOU?

13:27.007 --> 13:28.942
WHAT?! NO! WHY WOULD
I FALL FOR A GUY

13:28.976 --> 13:31.945
WHO'S PERFECT AND ALL? YOU
THINK THAT'S MY TYPE?

13:31.979 --> 13:34.181
WELL, BLEH.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.017
YOU CAN'T EVEN BE HONEST WITH
YOURSELF FOR LIKE A SECOND.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.486
OH, I CAN BE HONEST...
BIG-TIME HONEST.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.388
YOU KNOW WHAT? ALL RIGHT.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.157
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
IS TOTALLY UNHEALTHY.

13:44.191 --> 13:47.360
EXACTLY, YES. GETTING INVOLVED WITH
A HUNK WHO WORKS IN YOUR HOUSE

13:47.394 --> 13:51.498
- IS JUST NUTS.
- NO, YOU BEING SO INVOLVED IN MY LIFE

13:51.531 --> 13:54.434
IS UNHEALTHY. YOU'RE ALWAYS
HERE, HAVING OPINIONS.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.169
CAN I HELP IT IF I
HAVE GREAT IDEAS?

13:56.203 --> 13:59.039
WELL, WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE ONE.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.540
EVEN THOUGH MY
KITCHEN'S NOT DONE,

14:00.573 --> 14:02.342
- YOU'RE ALL UP IN MY GRILL.
- OH YEAH.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.178
'CAUSE YOU'RE NEVER IN MY PERSONAL
BUSINESS. WORKS BOTH WAYS, BURKEY.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.447
NO, TH DOESN'T WORK.
THIS IS TOXIC.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.116
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WANT OUT.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.019
WELL, FINALLY. A GREAT IDEA.
GOOD, GO.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.487
- GREAT, I'M GOING.
- YEAH, PACK UP YOUR STUFF AND GO

14:14.521 --> 14:16.523
TO...

14:16.556 --> 14:18.225
TO...

14:18.258 --> 14:20.160
THE NEW ROOM ABOVE THE GARAGE!

14:20.193 --> 14:22.362
YOU KNOW WHAT? YEAH, I WILL!

14:22.395 --> 14:24.164
ALL RIGHT? BUT I'M GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING:

14:24.197 --> 14:26.266
ONCE I GO, I AIN'T
COMING BACK...

14:26.299 --> 14:28.368
TO THE BASEMENT.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.070
I'M COUNTING ON IT.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.105
IT'LL BE WORTH
LOSING MY MONASTERY.

14:32.139 --> 14:35.275
- SANCTUARY.
- WHATEVER-ARY. IT'S YOURS.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.182
AND ALL THEY CARED ABOUT WAS
ORGANIZING DIFFERENT DRESS-UP DAYS.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.017
DISCO DAY, PAJAMA DAY.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.519
OOH, HOW ABOUT SLUTTY
CHEERLEADER DAY?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.288
STOP SUGGESTING THAT.

14:48.321 --> 14:51.191
ANYWAY, I'M NOT GOING BACK.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.026
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU WERE APPOINTED,

14:53.060 --> 14:56.529
LIKE A PRETTY BLONDE
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.566
AND I THOUGHT AIDAN, MR. "I
GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY,"

14:59.599 --> 15:02.002
WOULD AT LEAST TAKE WHAT
I HAD TO SAY SERIOUSLY.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.237
I HAD THIS GREAT IDEA ABOUT
PUTTING UP A FREEDOM MIC

15:04.271 --> 15:06.139
WHERE EVERYBODY COULD SPEAK OUT.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.640
YEAH, BECAUSE THEN EVERYBODY
COULD FINALLY SAY...

15:07.674 --> 15:09.342
BE QUIET ALREADY.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.912
HONEY, LET ME TELL YOU
HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.881
YOU KNOW, EVEN SOMETIMES
WITH A GOOD IDEA LIKE YOURS

15:14.914 --> 15:16.950
YOU STILL HAVE TO
PUSH PUSH PUSH.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.186
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT
THERE IN THE ROOM,

15:19.219 --> 15:21.288
- YOU CAN'T PUSH.
- YEAH, WHATEVER.

15:21.321 --> 15:24.491
- I'M SO DONE WITH THOSE PEOPLE.
- QUITTER.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.632
YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE THE
PERFECT PIECE OF TOAST OUT OF THAT THING?

15:32.665 --> 15:34.934
- UH, I CAN MAKE MY OWN...
- BAH BAH BAH BAH BAH.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.270
WATCH THIS.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.207
OHH.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.508
THANK YOU.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.244
NEED A LITTLE HELP THERE?

15:44.277 --> 15:47.147
I AM PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF
MAKING MY OWN SANDWICHES.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.349
SANDWICH-ES. OH, I SEE.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.684
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, PLANNING
ANOTHER LITTLE PICNIC

15:51.718 --> 15:55.122
WITH THE THUNDER
FROM DOWN UNDER?

15:55.155 --> 15:58.358
FOR YOUR INFORMATION THERE ARE
NO PICNICS PLANNED IN MY KITCHEN

15:58.391 --> 16:02.029
BECAUSE JULES IS STUCK ALL DAY OVER AT MRS.
NIGHTMARE'S HOUSE.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.264
OH, SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA TAKE THE
SANDWICHES OVER THERE AND THEN...

16:04.297 --> 16:08.235
YOU KNOW WHAT? I ALMOST DID
THAT WHOLE TOXIC THING AGAIN.

16:08.268 --> 16:11.238
MY FAULT. I VOLUNTEERED
INFORMATION.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.473
- YEAH. THAT WAS CLOSE.
- YEAH.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.108
( doorbell rings )

16:15.142 --> 16:18.145
- UGH, LENNOX, CAN YOU GET IT?
- I'M A LITTLE BUSY HERE.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.148
( scoffs ) FINE.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.687
OH, UH, HELLO.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.722
HI. LISTEN, I JUST
WANTED TO CATCH YOU

16:29.756 --> 16:32.192
BEFORE THAT SPIRIT
COMMITTEE MEETING TODAY

16:32.225 --> 16:33.960
WHICH I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.430
AH, YOU KNOW, AIDAN, THE SPIRIT
COMMITTEE KIND OF BROKE MY SPIRIT,

16:37.464 --> 16:39.332
SO I THINK I'M GONNA PASS.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.001
WHO'S THE CUTE BOY SELLING
DIMPLES DOOR-TO-DOOR?

16:42.035 --> 16:46.005
THAT'S AIDAN. HE'S PRESIDENT OF
EVERYTHING AND KING OF SCHOOL SPIRIT.

16:46.039 --> 16:49.609
LOOK, I KNOW MARTIN AND
STELLA HAVE SOME BAD IDEAS.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.644
NO, THEY'RE NOT BAD.
THEY'RE JUST...

16:51.678 --> 16:54.381
INCREDIBLY LAME AND
ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.149
( both chuckle )

16:56.183 --> 16:58.551
BUT YOURS WASN'T. WHY
DON'T YOU COME BACK?

16:58.585 --> 17:01.288
I DON'T HAVE THE DISCO
BALLS TO FIGHT THOSE TWO.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.390
YEAH, BUT TOGETHER,

17:03.423 --> 17:06.393
YOU AND ME, WE COULD
CHANGE THINGS.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.561
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS PUSH PUSH PUSH.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.531
I CAN'T PUSH ALONE.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.534
I GOTTA SAY, THAT
MAKES A LOT OF CUTE.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.304
SENSE. SENSE.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.206
WHY DIDN'T I SEE THAT BEFORE?

17:22.075 --> 17:23.576
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.246
YEAH, BUT DID YOU SAY IT
WITH THE CUTE BOY DIMPLES?

17:26.279 --> 17:28.348
HM, GOOD POINT.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.492
M-MEL!

17:39.526 --> 17:41.628
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I HAVE SANDWICHES

17:41.661 --> 17:43.430
AND I BROUGHT "PO-TAH-TO" CHIPS.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.799
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET, BUT IF MRS.
WESTBURN CATCHES ME SLACKING,

17:46.833 --> 17:48.768
- SHE'LL CHEW MY HEAD OFF.
- Woman: JULES DARLING,

17:48.801 --> 17:50.370
DID YOU WANT THE PINOT
OR THE ZINFANDEL?

17:50.403 --> 17:53.406
GO GO. IT GETS UGLY ONCE
SHE STARTS DRINKING.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.678
( gasps ) MY CABINETS!

17:58.711 --> 18:00.713
WHO'S SHE?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.749
UH, MRS. WESTBURN,
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET

18:02.782 --> 18:05.252
ANOTHER CLIENT OF MINE...
MS. BURKE.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.086
Westburn: MS. BURKE.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.257
OH, THE NEEDY ONE.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.658
SEE THOSE OLIVES RIGHT THERE?

18:11.691 --> 18:13.360
YOU MIGHT WANT TO WASH 'EM

18:13.393 --> 18:15.862
BEFORE HE PUTS 'EM IN YOUR MOUTH.
THEY'VE BEEN AROUND.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.171
- WHOA, HEY.
- HEY.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.838
SO HOW'S THE NEW ROOM
COMING UP THERE?

18:25.872 --> 18:29.309
IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME, ACTUALLY, AS
SOON AS I FIND ALL THE LOOSE NAILS.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.811
BUT I HAVE THIS GREAT SYSTEM:
WHAT I DO IS I STEP ON THEM

18:31.844 --> 18:33.680
AND THEN I JUST PULL
THEM OUT OF MY TOES.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.251
HEY, SO HOW DID YOUR PICNIC GO

18:38.285 --> 18:40.320
- WITH JULES?
- UGH.

18:40.353 --> 18:43.790
SO I SHOW UP LOOKING EXTRA
CUTE, EFFORTLESSLY,

18:43.823 --> 18:46.426
READY TO HAVE LUNCH
AND THEN, UH...

18:46.459 --> 18:49.296
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
SAYING TOO MUCH AGAIN.

18:49.329 --> 18:52.332
I DON'T WANT TO RUIN THIS HEALTHY
DISTANCE THING WE JUST STARTED.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.734
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. AND AS A
MATTER OF FACT, I HAVE TO SAY

18:54.767 --> 18:56.336
SINCE WE STEPPED UP THE PRIVACY,

18:56.369 --> 18:58.371
I CAN FEEL US BEING A LITTLE
MORE CIVIL TOWARD EACH OTHER.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.340
YEAH. YEAH, ME TOO.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.575
I THINK IT'S MUCH BETTER NOT
SHARING EVERY INTIMATE DETAIL.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.611
COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.645
OH BY THE WAY, I
PICKED UP SOME MORE

19:05.678 --> 19:06.846
OF THAT QUILTED TOILET
PAPER THAT YOU LIKE.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.349
OH, THE ONE THE LITTLE
CARTOON BEARS USE?

19:09.382 --> 19:10.750
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.552
- THANKS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:15.355 --> 19:18.391
I GOTTA GET BACK UPSTAIRS AND
CONTINUE WORKING ON MY NEW ROOM.

19:18.425 --> 19:19.826
SO I'LL SEE YOU.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.796
- HEY, JOE?
- YEAH?

19:25.498 --> 19:27.367
YOU KNOW,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.636
NOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE
ROOM OVER THE GARAGE,

19:29.669 --> 19:31.671
IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE WEIRD...

19:31.704 --> 19:34.407
I MEAN, YOU NOT BEING
WITHIN SHOUTING DISTANCE?

19:34.441 --> 19:36.476
YOU CAN SHOUT LOUDER
THAN YOU THINK, BURKE.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.345
AW, YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.

19:39.812 --> 19:43.316
- UH, WELL, GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT, LONGO.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.389
JOE, QUICK!

19:49.422 --> 19:51.458
- YEAH? WHAT?
- NOTHING. JUST TESTING.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.496
( counting in Italian )

20:01.568 --> 20:03.603
( panting )

20:14.914 --> 20:16.949
SO MUCH FOR PRIVACY.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.453
SO MUCH FOR DISTANCE.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.959
- Aidan: HEY RYDER, IS LENNOX HERE?
- LENNOX!

20:26.993 --> 20:29.562
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE
MUST BE UPSTAIRS.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.698
( shouts ) LENNOX!

20:31.731 --> 20:33.300
Lennox: I HEARD YOU!

20:33.333 --> 20:35.268
WOULD YOU STOP YELLING?

20:35.302 --> 20:37.937
OH HEY, AIDAN.

20:37.970 --> 20:41.374
WAIT, I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE ON THAT
STUDENT COUNCIL SPIRIT THING.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.277
- I KNOW YOU'RE TAKING SUGGESTIONS...
- MM-HMM. GET OUT.

20:44.311 --> 20:47.280
I'LL SAVE IT FOR
THE FREEDOM MIC.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.818
HERE'S THE PROPOSAL THAT'S
GOING TO THE VICE PRINCIPAL.

20:51.851 --> 20:55.488
IT LOOKS GOOD. I GUESS THAT'S
THE END OF OUR COMMITTEE.

20:55.522 --> 20:58.291
MAYBE WE COULD KEEP ON MEETING.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.792
YOU MEAN LIKE MORE SPIRIT STUFF?

20:59.826 --> 21:01.428
NO, LIKE,

21:01.461 --> 21:04.497
I WAS THINKING A SMALLER
COMMITTEE, JUST TWO PEOPLE.

21:04.531 --> 21:07.367
AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT
OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES

21:07.400 --> 21:09.436
LIKE, UH, WHAT MOVIE TO GO SEE?

21:11.504 --> 21:13.906
YOU'RE ASKING ME
OUT, AREN'T YOU?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.375
I WAS TRYING.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.378
I DON'T KNOW.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.381
DATING A KID LIKE YOU COULD
REALLY HURT MY STREET CRED.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.751
BUT I'LL RISK IT.
