WEBVTT

00:39.625 --> 00:40.625
Watch it.

00:42.458 --> 00:44.083
Amateurs.

00:45.958 --> 00:48.750
Now you know I hate
to question your decisions, Miriam, but--

00:48.833 --> 00:52.291
Do I look like the kind of fool
dumb enough to storm a mage tower?

00:52.791 --> 00:54.250
They were Dolph's idea.

00:54.333 --> 00:57.458
You mean he wants those idiots
and the two of us

00:57.541 --> 00:59.583
to fight our way
through that entire building,

00:59.666 --> 01:02.666
steal a case of lyrium
and fight our way back out again?

01:03.958 --> 01:05.750
What's your plan?

01:05.833 --> 01:07.375
Bribed the washer woman.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.750
All we really needed
were a couple of mage robes

01:09.833 --> 01:11.416
and, uh, you know,

01:12.750 --> 01:13.708
a distraction.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.333
Dolph will be livid.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.166
Yeah. Probably.

02:27.916 --> 02:29.875
Stupid, blasted knife-ear!

02:30.666 --> 02:33.375
Just couldn't stick to the plan,
could ya, elf?

02:33.875 --> 02:36.208
Always so sure you know better.

02:36.291 --> 02:37.916
I got the lyrium, Dolph.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.416
Yeah, and got three recruits jailed,

02:41.500 --> 02:42.958
including my nephew.

02:43.041 --> 02:47.708
If they couldn't get past two guards,
they never could have taken a mage tower.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.875
Hey, it's me you're angry with,
not Roland.

02:54.958 --> 02:56.291
Yeah, damn right, I am!

02:56.375 --> 02:59.791
You know, half my men seem to think
<i>you</i> are the one in charge here.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.791
And he's the worst.

03:02.708 --> 03:04.083
You're still the boss.

03:07.833 --> 03:10.208
I hope we are not interrupting anything.

03:14.625 --> 03:15.625
Sapphira?

03:17.166 --> 03:19.291
Hey, Miri. You kept the scarf.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.583
No. No! You don't just get to…

03:23.666 --> 03:25.333
-I know.
-Not after you just left.

03:25.416 --> 03:28.125
-I'm sorry, but--
-I don't care about your apologies.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.333
Please, not here.

03:33.833 --> 03:34.958
Who are you?

03:35.541 --> 03:38.875
Ah, sorry about that.
They, uh, have history.

03:39.375 --> 03:42.083
We are the ones
that commissioned this little robbery.

03:42.166 --> 03:47.583
Oh, Master Fairbanks.
So nice to finally meet you in person.

03:47.666 --> 03:49.875
-Uh, sorry about--
-No apologies necessary.

03:50.375 --> 03:54.625
The lyrium was only to see
if you were as good as Hira promised.

03:54.708 --> 03:56.416
And you are. Uh, both of you.

03:57.250 --> 04:00.041
Which is why
I'd like to offer you both a job.

04:00.125 --> 04:02.458
Hey! Customer or not,

04:02.541 --> 04:07.041
nobody does anything in Dolph's Daggers
without Dolph's say-so.

04:07.125 --> 04:08.500
I suggest you take it.

04:08.583 --> 04:12.458
You see, I already told the City Guard
where to find the missing lyrium.

04:13.125 --> 04:14.875
The entire garrison
is on its way right now.

04:16.791 --> 04:17.791
You did what?

04:18.416 --> 04:20.166
Kill him! Kill them all!

04:35.208 --> 04:36.791
Both of you, stay down.

04:38.875 --> 04:40.791
This isn't about you, Miriam.

04:40.875 --> 04:43.041
-Stand aside.
-No.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.666
The Guard is coming, Hasem.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.333
Your children need their father,

05:04.416 --> 05:07.791
and I will kill every one of you
before I let you touch her.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.166
I swear it.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.333
-Do you understand me?

05:12.583 --> 05:14.833
-Do you understand?

05:20.791 --> 05:22.458
Daggers, move out.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.666
No, no, no! She is not the boss! I am!

05:28.625 --> 05:29.916
Finish them off!

05:41.500 --> 05:44.500
Next time, aim a little more to the right.

05:47.333 --> 05:50.750
Seems like a good time for a new venture.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.708
-Miriam! Wait.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.583
You were magnificent, you know that?

06:03.625 --> 06:06.500
Not enough to stop you
from leaving me to join the Inquisition.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.125
I asked you to come.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.541
But there was
a demon-spewing hole in the sky.

06:11.625 --> 06:13.666
Somebody had to stop it
from destroying the world.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.000
But you didn't!

06:15.583 --> 06:19.500
The Herald of Andraste sealed the breach.
They killed Corypheus.

06:19.583 --> 06:22.666
People like us
don't change the world, Hira.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.125
Because people like you never try!

06:28.291 --> 06:31.208
Listen, I know I'm asking a lot,

06:32.083 --> 06:34.916
but the Inquisition gave me
one last mission before it broke up

06:35.000 --> 06:36.791
and I need your help to do it.

06:37.416 --> 06:40.625
And after this,
we can go to the Hinterlands

06:40.708 --> 06:43.458
and make cheese for all I care,

06:44.041 --> 06:45.666
so long as we're together.

06:54.166 --> 06:55.208
What's the job?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.500
Let's meet the rest of the team first.

07:02.541 --> 07:05.375
Roland, Miriam, this is Qwydion,

07:05.458 --> 07:07.916
a rebel mage and a talented healer.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.208
And that's Lacklon.

07:10.041 --> 07:14.458
Lord of Fortune and a talented…
whatever the opposite of healer is.

07:14.541 --> 07:17.083
I'm not like a real rebel, you know.

07:17.166 --> 07:21.041
My passion is more elemental magic,
like explosions.

07:21.541 --> 07:25.666
But people pay you more to blow stuff up
if it's for something they believe in, so…

07:26.166 --> 07:27.458
Nice to meet you.

07:30.208 --> 07:31.625
Eh, we'll see, right?

07:34.666 --> 07:38.333
Three experienced fighters,
two mages, and yourself?

07:39.208 --> 07:40.958
This job must be dangerous.

07:43.916 --> 07:44.750
It is.

07:45.416 --> 07:47.541
Before the Inquisition ended,

07:47.625 --> 07:50.958
we learned the Tevinter Chantry
was in possession of an artifact.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.666
The Circulum Infinitus.

07:54.250 --> 07:57.166
What's a Circu, whatever it is, do?

07:57.250 --> 08:03.000
No idea. I'm not a mage,
but in the words of Cassandra Pentaghast…

08:03.083 --> 08:04.083
It does not matter.

08:04.750 --> 08:08.375
All you need to know is that it is
an extremely dangerous artifact

08:08.458 --> 08:10.083
fueled by blood magic.

08:10.166 --> 08:12.625
And I, for one, cannot recall any good

08:12.708 --> 08:14.875
coming from something powered by murder.

08:15.916 --> 08:18.875
The Inquisition told Hira and I
to steal the Circulum

08:18.958 --> 08:20.458
and deliver it to Orlais.

08:21.041 --> 08:25.041
We tracked it to an old summer palace
belonging to the Tevinter Divine,

08:25.125 --> 08:26.583
the head of their faith.

08:27.083 --> 08:29.583
It's being studied
by a Magister named Rezaren--

08:29.666 --> 08:30.500
Ammosine.

08:31.791 --> 08:32.791
Know this guy?

08:34.791 --> 08:37.666
And the palace is in the city of Nessum.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.458
That's why you needed me.

08:41.583 --> 08:45.375
Yes, but only because
there was no other option.

08:46.166 --> 08:48.208
We have a very small window of time.

08:48.291 --> 08:51.875
You're the only person outside Tevinter
that's ever been in that building.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.458
You know its layout, its defenses.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.500
You're our only hope
of pulling this off, Miriam.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.208
Will you help us,

09:01.458 --> 09:02.291
please?

09:03.916 --> 09:04.750
No.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.000
Miriam, wait.

09:15.166 --> 09:17.583
I told you
I never go back there and…

09:17.666 --> 09:19.708
…yet here you come,

09:19.791 --> 09:22.833
spinning a fairy tale
about our happy cheese-making future

09:22.916 --> 09:24.541
just so you can use me.

09:25.125 --> 09:29.000
You're right. I should have told you
everything, and for that, I'm sorry.

09:30.083 --> 09:33.708
But I think you might need this mission
as much as I do.

09:34.875 --> 09:38.083
You have to stop
running from the past, Miri.

09:38.166 --> 09:43.333
If you can't do it now,
I worry that maybe you never will.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.583
And I can't live like that.

09:45.666 --> 09:48.791
I won't set foot in that place.

09:49.375 --> 09:52.833
And I'd never ask you to.
Just show us a way in.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.458
Let me help you
take something back from those bastards

09:56.541 --> 09:59.000
and we can live happily ever after.

10:01.041 --> 10:01.875
Together?

10:06.500 --> 10:07.375
Together.

10:13.208 --> 10:16.750
<i> It's easy to think</i>
<i>Tevinter is the same as any other country.</i>

10:17.250 --> 10:18.083
<i>But it's not.</i>

10:19.041 --> 10:23.125
<i>Magic rules there,</i>
<i>and those who have it rule everyone else.</i>

10:23.666 --> 10:27.125
<i>The Templars don't protect people</i>
<i>from mages who turn evil.</i>

10:28.083 --> 10:32.333
<i>Instead, they act as enforcers</i>
<i>for powerful mages called Magisters.</i>

10:33.625 --> 10:36.875
<i>They have their own religion,</i>
<i>the Imperial Chantry,</i>

10:36.958 --> 10:40.375
<i>and their own magic-wielding Divine</i>
<i>to lead it.</i>

10:41.041 --> 10:45.875
<i>Qunari are hated,</i>
<i>and most elves live in outright slavery.</i>

10:47.791 --> 10:53.041
<i>Blood magic, raised corpses, and demons</i>
<i>may be frowned on officially,</i>

10:53.125 --> 10:55.375
<i>but Magisters are the officials,</i>

10:55.458 --> 10:59.083
<i>so they tend to turn a blind eye</i>
<i>towards anyone with power.</i>

11:00.250 --> 11:04.666
<i>Since we're robbing The Divine himself,</i>
<i>well, let's stay on our toes, huh?</i>

11:09.875 --> 11:11.166
I shit you not.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.750
It was just a hairy nug the whole time.

11:18.375 --> 11:20.250
I can get up by my damn self.

11:21.125 --> 11:24.500
You wanna help?
Tell the world's tallest elf to slow down.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.375
Hey, man, you can't blame someone
for not wanting to spend a lot of time

11:27.458 --> 11:28.750
in a country that enslaved her.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.625
-Sh.

11:31.708 --> 11:33.166
What? Isn't she a runaway?

11:33.750 --> 11:35.791
Don't be dense.

11:35.875 --> 11:39.500
Fairbanks would never
be stupid enough to hire a runaway. Right?

11:40.125 --> 11:41.958
She's an elf from Tevinter.

11:42.041 --> 11:44.416
I've left it at that.
I suggest you do the same.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.208
You can't be serious.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.500
What if Little Miss Wayfinder's
still being hunted?

11:51.583 --> 11:54.208
What if she loses her nerve
as soon as she sees home?

11:55.250 --> 11:56.958
Watch your tongue, dwarf.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.666
Whatever I am, I've survived things

11:59.750 --> 12:02.375
that make the deep roads
look like a pleasant stroll.

12:02.458 --> 12:06.083
And I assure you,
you'll lose your nerve long before I will.

12:06.166 --> 12:08.500
So lengthen your stride
and shut the fuck up!

12:10.375 --> 12:11.791
Whoa.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.208
That hurt me a little.

12:13.291 --> 12:16.541
-Blasted elfin hearing.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.166
Hmm…

12:18.958 --> 12:20.916
What are you smiling at, horn-head?

12:21.916 --> 12:23.791
If you don't take him, I will.

12:41.958 --> 12:43.458
Wow, it's beautiful.

12:43.958 --> 12:47.375
So is a mage's staff
right before it shoots fire at you.

12:58.333 --> 12:59.958
Hold. State your business.

13:01.791 --> 13:04.375
-Ah, my wife and I are from Carastes.

13:04.458 --> 13:05.958
She has bellows cough,

13:06.041 --> 13:10.333
and we're following the Pilgrimage
of Divine Adnias with our servants

13:10.416 --> 13:12.166
in hopes that she might be healed.

13:22.791 --> 13:26.875
Any elf must post a five-gold bond
in case they break the peace.

13:26.958 --> 13:28.458
-Wha-- Five gold?

13:28.541 --> 13:29.625
-Uh, ow!

13:30.958 --> 13:33.750
Light of the Maker shine upon you.

13:36.041 --> 13:37.000
And you as well.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.416
Uh, a month's wages
to get through the gate?

13:44.500 --> 13:46.833
They might as well just rob us outright.

13:48.666 --> 13:50.458
We won't be here for long, okay?

13:50.541 --> 13:52.208
Uh, I know. It's just…

13:52.291 --> 13:56.125
…every breath I take here
is one too many.

13:57.333 --> 13:58.458
Well then,

13:59.291 --> 14:00.750
we should get to work.

14:04.541 --> 14:06.708
<i>They may call it a summer palace,</i>

14:08.125 --> 14:10.958
<i>but it's actually three</i>
<i>different structures joined together.</i>

14:12.666 --> 14:14.083
<i>The cathedral is at the top.</i>

14:14.166 --> 14:16.708
<i>No way in there</i>
<i>except from the palace itself.</i>

14:17.583 --> 14:21.416
<i>Below that, the whole place</i>
<i>is a maze of secret passages,</i>

14:22.000 --> 14:23.208
<i>easy to get lost in.</i>

14:24.208 --> 14:27.875
<i>And it's all built</i>
<i>atop a sealed temple to the old gods.</i>

14:31.583 --> 14:33.416
<i>It'll take time to find a way in.</i>

14:33.500 --> 14:35.500
<i>Don't worry. I've got a place.</i>

14:36.208 --> 14:37.916
<i>I'll need</i>
<i>all the time you can give.</i>

14:38.750 --> 14:41.541
The furniture is all High Imperium,
of course,

14:41.625 --> 14:44.500
and the estate features
a generous private courtyard

14:44.583 --> 14:46.666
that I'm sure your bride will love.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.333
<i>If the smuggler routes</i>
<i>are closed,</i>

14:57.416 --> 15:00.208
<i>there are discreet ways</i>
<i>into the palace itself.</i>

15:00.958 --> 15:05.083
<i> You mean one of the Divines</i>
<i>was involved in something illicit?</i>

15:06.041 --> 15:07.833
<i>I am shocked.</i>

15:09.375 --> 15:12.500
<i> Even if this Divine isn't,</i>
<i>they could still be usable.</i>

15:14.666 --> 15:16.708
I don't like the sound of "could."

15:17.500 --> 15:21.125
Well, neither do I, but I'm not
the only one with a job to do, am I?

15:21.708 --> 15:24.333
You're right.
We'll strike during the evening service.

15:24.416 --> 15:26.541
-Qwydion and I--
-The magic mavens.

15:27.583 --> 15:31.291
Will ensure everyone in the cathedral
stays put during the robbery.

15:31.375 --> 15:35.125
I mean, naturally,
but that's gonna take a lot of magic.

15:35.208 --> 15:38.416
So, uh, we should stock up
to be safe, right?

15:38.500 --> 15:41.000
I mean, we don't want to run out
in the middle of things.

15:41.083 --> 15:45.583
Don't you think a Qunari
buying a small arsenal of magic weapons

15:45.666 --> 15:46.916
might attract some attention?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.541
Oh, it's not about attracting attention.

15:49.625 --> 15:52.000
-It's about what kind.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.750
Yes, can I help you?

16:00.416 --> 16:01.958
Oh, I certainly hope so.

16:02.041 --> 16:05.416
My master is new in town
and he sent me to fetch

16:06.291 --> 16:09.625
lyrium, healing potions, knockout powder,
arcane grenades of all kinds,

16:09.708 --> 16:11.625
and, um, everything else on this list.

16:11.708 --> 16:15.083
What in the name of Andraste
does he need all this for?

16:15.916 --> 16:18.166
Two words. The Blight.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.958
Master barely survived the last one,

16:21.041 --> 16:23.458
and his bad knee
says another one's on the way.

16:23.541 --> 16:24.500
Oh, yeah.

16:24.583 --> 16:28.125
And if you think I'd let
a bunch of mindless, murderous monsters

16:28.208 --> 16:30.166
touch a hair
on that sweet bald head of his,

16:30.250 --> 16:31.708
you've got another thing coming.

16:33.208 --> 16:37.958
You know, I have some more exotic
defense items in the back.

16:38.041 --> 16:38.916
Show me.

16:39.958 --> 16:43.083
<i>Where exactly</i>
<i>do Lacklon and I fit in?</i>

16:43.166 --> 16:45.750
-<i>Ain't it obvious?</i>

16:45.833 --> 16:46.833
<i>We're the muscle.</i>

16:46.916 --> 16:49.458
<i>You take out the guards</i>
<i>and watch my back in the vault.</i>

16:49.541 --> 16:52.500
<i>Not to mention,</i>
<i>make sure everyone else gets out alive.</i>

16:53.125 --> 16:56.541
<i>I need you both in perfect sync.</i>
<i>Think you can handle that?</i>

16:58.708 --> 17:02.000
If you're trying to distract me,
it won't work.

17:02.083 --> 17:05.083
Besides, your girlfriend's
still got to find a way into the palace.

17:05.166 --> 17:06.250
Hmm?

17:06.333 --> 17:07.916
I don't have a girlfriend.

17:13.041 --> 17:17.458
<i>Let's remember, it all means</i>
<i>precisely squat if we can't find a way in.</i>

17:21.791 --> 17:22.625
I'll find it.

17:27.125 --> 17:27.958
I will.

17:37.375 --> 17:40.416
You're in my seat, elf.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.500
There a reason for that?

17:52.250 --> 17:56.000
I'm sorry, is this more important
than listening to me?

17:56.083 --> 17:58.416
Of course not, sir.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.583
Apologies.

18:01.791 --> 18:03.416
We have a problem, friend?

18:05.541 --> 18:11.041
Yes, I think this elf's a runaway slave,
with stolen property no less.

18:11.125 --> 18:14.458
That's not true, sir.
Please, don't turn me in to the guard.

18:16.125 --> 18:18.958
Sorry, elf, you're coming with me.

18:19.458 --> 18:20.750
Oh. Hey!

18:20.833 --> 18:22.125
Keep walking.

18:22.208 --> 18:23.916
They can't look at the plans.

18:25.208 --> 18:27.000
Fair play on that one.

18:27.083 --> 18:29.666
If you share her, I can pay you for it.

18:33.583 --> 18:36.500
-I don't like your implication, friend.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.625
Ugh, don't tell me you care
about some bat-faced bitch's honor!

18:44.083 --> 18:45.125
Huh.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.041
Guess I do.

18:51.708 --> 18:52.958
Let's go! Come on!

19:19.833 --> 19:20.708
Mm.

19:22.375 --> 19:24.375
Hey, Lacklon! Catch!

19:24.958 --> 19:26.416
-Ha ha!

19:35.166 --> 19:36.458
Oh… What…

19:37.250 --> 19:38.666
What happened here?

19:40.833 --> 19:42.291
Half-off shots.

19:45.541 --> 19:48.625
And boom, down they went!

19:50.583 --> 19:54.500
You know, my wife's right.
I just can't stay out of trouble.

19:57.708 --> 19:59.666
Can you just stop?

19:59.750 --> 20:03.250
You think you're all heroes,
punching a couple of drunk Tevinters?

20:03.333 --> 20:04.333
You…

20:04.416 --> 20:07.875
You think that did anything
except risk our mission?

20:10.708 --> 20:11.625
Neither did I.

20:25.250 --> 20:27.083
Come in.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.541
Do you want to talk about it?

20:29.125 --> 20:32.166
Because the bar fight might not have been
the smartest idea, but--

20:32.250 --> 20:34.375
I figured out a way into the palace.

20:35.125 --> 20:36.708
That's… That's great.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.333
Fairbanks, get in here!

20:41.958 --> 20:42.958
What's wrong?

20:46.583 --> 20:48.208
Everyone okay?

20:48.291 --> 20:51.083
Miriam found a way
for us to get into the palace.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.583
The only way in.

20:54.416 --> 20:58.208
It's me. There's an old escape tunnel
intended for The Divine himself.

20:58.291 --> 20:59.958
I cleared the outer entrance,

21:00.041 --> 21:02.958
but the inner one
can only be opened from the inside.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.291
No. You do not have to do this.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.583
Oh, trust me,

21:07.666 --> 21:08.916
I don't want to, but…

21:10.208 --> 21:11.500
you all stood up for me.

21:11.583 --> 21:14.666
In the stupidest way possible,
but you did it,

21:14.750 --> 21:16.416
and that means something.

21:17.666 --> 21:18.500
Besides…

21:20.583 --> 21:22.125
I really want that cheese farm.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.333
If you don't come back,

21:27.833 --> 21:29.166
I'll kill you myself.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.833
Up-up-up. Don't use them all at once.

21:42.916 --> 21:45.875
That's more your problem
than mine, ain't it?

22:06.750 --> 22:07.625
Thank you.

22:09.291 --> 22:10.208
Just be there.

22:41.875 --> 22:43.291
Where do you think you're going?

22:43.375 --> 22:45.375
-This has to be finished before--

22:46.250 --> 22:48.625
Forgive me. On your way.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.875
Come back later.

23:07.958 --> 23:09.625
Hey, I said--

23:33.875 --> 23:34.708
We're in.
