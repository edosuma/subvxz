00:28.280 --> 00:32.080
You're gonna love this.
One, two, three.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.440
It's lovely!

00:38.480 --> 00:40.480
You want to buy Shukina?

00:42.600 --> 00:47.120
Or Peshwami? Most beautiful
Peshwami in all of Shan Shen.

00:47.155 --> 00:48.600
Er, no, thanks.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.260
Tell your fortune, lady?

00:59.295 --> 01:01.125
The future predicted.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.325
Your life foretold. Oh, no, thanks.

01:04.360 --> 01:08.960
Don't you want to know
if you're going to be happy?

01:08.995 --> 01:10.920
I'm happy right now, thanks.

01:10.955 --> 01:12.725
You've got red hair.

01:12.760 --> 01:15.560
The reading's free for red hair.

01:15.595 --> 01:17.720
All right, then.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.800
Oh, you're fascinating!

01:31.835 --> 01:34.397
No, but you're good.

01:34.432 --> 01:36.925
I can see... a man.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.620
The most remarkable man.

01:39.655 --> 01:42.245
How did you meet him?

01:42.280 --> 01:44.240
You're supposed to tell me.

01:44.275 --> 01:45.897
I see the future.

01:45.932 --> 01:47.485
Tell me the past.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.220
When did your lives cross?

01:50.255 --> 01:52.885
It's sort of complicated.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.840
I ended up in his spaceship
on my wedding day.

01:55.875 --> 01:58.760
Long story.
But what led you to that meeting?

01:58.795 --> 02:01.817
All sorts of things,

02:01.852 --> 02:04.805
but my job, I suppose.

02:04.840 --> 02:08.324
It was on Earth, this planet
called Earth. Miles away.

02:08.360 --> 02:13.720
But I had this job, as a temp,
I was a secretary, in a place
called HC Clements.

02:13.755 --> 02:17.440
HC Clements, can I help you?

02:20.840 --> 02:22.600
Sorry.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.600
It's the incense. Just breathe deep.

02:29.960 --> 02:33.360
This job of yours.
What choices led you there?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.685
There was a choice.
Six months before.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.880
Cos the agency offered me this
contract with HC Clements.

02:41.915 --> 02:45.600
There was this other job,
my mum knew this man...

02:45.635 --> 02:49.725
Jival, he's called, Jival Chowdry.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.720
He runs that little photocopy
business and he needs a secretary.

02:54.755 --> 02:56.685
I've got a job!

02:56.720 --> 02:59.040
As a temp! This is permanent!

02:59.075 --> 03:01.325
It's 20,000 a year, Donna.

03:01.360 --> 03:07.960
HC Clements is in the City,
it's nice, it's posh, so stop it!

03:10.320 --> 03:15.120
Your life
could have gone one way or the other.

03:15.155 --> 03:18.480
What made you decide? I just did.

03:18.515 --> 03:20.320
But when was the moment?

03:24.520 --> 03:30.600
It won't take long, just turn right,
we'll pop in and see Mr Chowdry,
so Suzette can introduce you.

03:30.635 --> 03:33.765
I'm going left, if you don't
like it, get out and walk!

03:33.800 --> 03:37.880
If you turn right, you'll have
a career. Not just filling-in.

03:37.915 --> 03:39.525
You think I'm so useless.

03:39.560 --> 03:43.165
Oh, I know why you want a job
with HC Clements, lady.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.405
Cos you think you'll meet a man
with lots of money and your
whole life will change.

03:47.440 --> 03:53.000
Well, let me tell you, sweetheart,
City executives don't need temps.
Except for practice.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.280
Yeah, well, they haven't met me!

03:59.640 --> 04:02.085
You turned left.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.420
What if you'd turned right?
What then?

04:05.455 --> 04:08.720
Let go of my hands.
What if it changes?

04:08.755 --> 04:12.480
What if you go right?

04:17.880 --> 04:19.680
Stop it!

04:21.480 --> 04:24.520
What's that?! What's on my back?
CHIRRUPING

04:24.555 --> 04:26.445
What is it?

04:26.480 --> 04:28.045
What's on my back?

04:28.080 --> 04:34.520
Make the choice again, Donna Noble,
and change your mind. Turn right!

04:38.400 --> 04:41.020
I'm turning.

04:41.055 --> 04:43.727
Turn right.

04:43.762 --> 04:46.341
Turn right!

04:46.376 --> 04:48.885
Turn RIGHT!

04:48.920 --> 04:53.560
Let me tell you, sweetheart,
City executives don't need temps.

04:53.595 --> 04:55.520
Except for practice.

04:55.555 --> 04:57.085
Yeah.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.365
Suppose you're right.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.440
Turn right, and never meet that man.

05:03.475 --> 05:07.480
Turn right and change the world!

MUSIC: "Merry Xmas Everybody"
by Slade

05:57.875 --> 05:59.845
Here we are! Feed at the trough!

05:59.880 --> 06:04.680
Mooky says, let's go to the
Boardwalk, it's two for the price of
one. Christmas Eve? It'll be heaving!

06:04.715 --> 06:07.085
Well, exactly! Get in and grab 'em!

06:07.120 --> 06:10.760
That's the second round of drinks
you've bought, it was my turn.

06:10.795 --> 06:13.445
I can afford it. Promotion!

06:13.480 --> 06:18.920
You are talking to Jival Chowdry's
Personal Assistant,
I'll have you know.

06:18.955 --> 06:23.840
Capital P, capital A,
Â£23,000 per annum, merci beaucoup!

06:23.875 --> 06:27.120
Here's to Mr Chowdry! Mr Chowdry!

06:27.155 --> 06:28.565
She gets all the luck.

06:28.600 --> 06:32.645
What's wrong? What is it?

06:32.680 --> 06:36.325
Sorry? Did someone spill
a drink on me? No.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.325
Why d'you keep looking
at my shoulder, what's wrong?

06:39.360 --> 06:42.725
I don't know. Oh, don't tell me
you're getting all spooky again.

06:42.760 --> 06:47.320
It was bad enough when you saw the
ghost of Earl Mountbatten at the
Boat Show. What're you looking at?

06:47.355 --> 06:50.325
What is it? It's like...

06:50.360 --> 06:53.680
It's like there's something
I can't see.

06:53.715 --> 06:55.325
No, shut up all of you!

06:55.360 --> 06:58.045
Come and see.
Just look at the sky!

06:58.080 --> 07:01.160
It's a star! It's a Christmas star!
Come on, then.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.925
What the hell is that?!
Ken Livingston, that's what!

07:10.960 --> 07:14.000
Spending our money on decorations!
How much did that cost?!

07:14.035 --> 07:16.960
Don't be so stupid,
it's flying, it's really flying!

07:21.360 --> 07:23.360
That's not a star -

07:23.395 --> 07:25.405
that's a web.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.680
It's heading east,
the middle of the city.

07:45.520 --> 07:49.760
Alice, there's a great big
web star thing shooting at people

07:49.795 --> 07:51.520
and you're looking at ME!

07:52.560 --> 07:55.600
There's something on your back!

08:00.680 --> 08:03.165
Donna! Where you going?!

08:03.200 --> 08:06.480
You'll get yourself killed! Donna!!

08:10.440 --> 08:11.960
Fire!

08:17.720 --> 08:23.320
Everyone stay back! The Thames has
been closed. Return to your homes.

08:23.355 --> 08:25.720
Keep away from the river,
and that's an order.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.685
'Trap 1 to Greyhound 15,
what is your report? Over.'

08:31.720 --> 08:36.205
From the evidence I'd say
he managed to stop a creature,
some sort of red spider.

08:36.240 --> 08:42.360
Blew up the base underneath the
barrier, flooded the whole thing.
Over. 'And where is he now? Over.'

08:42.395 --> 08:45.797
We've found a body, sir. Over.

08:45.832 --> 08:48.356
'Is it him? Over.' I think so.

08:48.391 --> 08:50.880
Just didn't make it out in time.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.880
The Doctor is dead.
It must have happened too fast
for him to regenerate.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.760
Escort the ambulance
back to unit base.

09:20.080 --> 09:23.445
What happened, what did they find?
Did they find someone?

09:23.480 --> 09:27.920
I don't know. Bloke called the
Doctor or something. Where is he?

09:27.955 --> 09:30.360
They took him away. He's dead.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.805
I'm sorry. Did you know him?

09:35.840 --> 09:39.240
I mean, they didn't say his name.

09:39.275 --> 09:40.680
It could be any doctor.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.920
I came so far.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.000
It could be anyone.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.980
What's your name? Donna.

09:54.015 --> 09:57.005
And you? Oh, I was just...

09:57.040 --> 09:59.560
passing by, I shouldn't even be here.

09:59.595 --> 10:02.080
This is wrong. This is wrong.
CHIRRUPING

10:04.440 --> 10:08.400
Sorry, what was it, Donna what?
Why d'you keep looking at my back?

10:08.435 --> 10:10.085
I'm not. Yes, you are.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.245
You keep looking behind me,
you're doing it now.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.440
What is it, what's there? Has
someone put something on my back?

10:27.160 --> 10:31.165
You can't sack me!
I'm your Personal Assistant!

10:31.200 --> 10:34.765
You don't have to make a scene, just
come downstairs, and we can talk.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.600
Oh, I'll make a scene, right in
front of a tribunal. And the first
thing I'll say is "wandering hands"!

10:39.635 --> 10:43.317
You know what it's been like
for the past few months,
ever since that Christmas thing.

10:43.352 --> 10:47.000
Half my contracts were on the
other side of the river,
and the Thames is still closed off.

10:47.035 --> 10:51.040
Look, I can't deliver, I'm losing a
fortune. Well, sack one of this lot!

10:51.075 --> 10:54.577
Sack Cliff! He just sits there,
I don't know what he does all day.

10:54.612 --> 10:58.080
Sorry, Cliff. ..Actually, I'm not
sorry, what DO you do all day?

10:59.057 --> 11:00.120
What the hell?!

11:05.080 --> 11:07.440
Like an earthquake.

11:07.475 --> 11:09.445
That's weird.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.760
Funny sort of clouds...

11:11.795 --> 11:13.765
Who typed this?

11:13.800 --> 11:17.880
I'm your PA, did you get
someone else to type this?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.005
Beatrice!

11:22.040 --> 11:26.360
It sounds impossible, but the
entire hospital has vanished.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.965
The Royal Hope no longer exists.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.645
It's not been destroyed,
there's no wreckage,

11:31.680 --> 11:37.200
it's simply gone. Reports
from bystanders say that the rain
lifted up around the hospital...

11:37.235 --> 11:40.005
Hole punch, having that.
Stapler, mine.

11:40.040 --> 11:43.565
Toy cactus,
you can have that, Beatrice, catch!

11:43.600 --> 11:47.645
Cliff, I'd leave you my mousemat,
but I'm worried you'd cut yourself.

11:47.680 --> 11:52.600
All right, Donna, have some respect.
There's 2,000 people in that
hospital. And it's vanished!

11:52.635 --> 11:54.805
I'll show you vanishing.
Thanks for nothing!

11:54.840 --> 11:57.960
Oh, and you know when that
money went missing from the kitty?

11:57.995 --> 12:00.560
Anne Marie. That's all I'm saying.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.928
Anne Marie!

12:04.120 --> 12:07.080
Oh, don't tell me,
the hospital's back!

12:07.115 --> 12:10.405
Well, isn't that wizard?!

12:10.440 --> 12:14.760
To confirm.
The Royal Hope Hospital was returned
to its original position.

12:14.795 --> 12:16.365
But with only one survivor.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.840
The only person left alive, is
medical student Oliver Morgenstern.

12:20.875 --> 12:22.605
And there were these creatures.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.680
Like rhinos. Talking rhinos
in black leather... Rhinos?

12:29.880 --> 12:33.285
..We couldn't breathe,
we were running out of air.

12:33.320 --> 12:37.360
A colleague of mine gave me
the last oxygen tank. Martha.

12:37.395 --> 12:39.777
Martha Jones.

12:39.812 --> 12:42.125
And she died.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.765
Least you've got a hole punch.

12:44.800 --> 12:49.800
And a raffle ticket. Yeah,
well, they can keep the raffle, I
wouldn't take a penny off that man.

12:49.835 --> 12:52.525
Honestly, you two!
There's aliens on the news!

12:52.560 --> 12:56.640
They took that hospital
all the way to the moon, and you're
banging on about raffle tickets!

12:56.675 --> 12:59.857
Don't be daft, Gramps,
it wasn't the moon, it couldn't be.

12:59.892 --> 13:03.005
I am telling you, it is getting
worse, these past few years.

13:03.040 --> 13:08.040
It's like all of a sudden,
they suddenly know all about us
and there's keen eyes up there

13:08.075 --> 13:12.165
not friendly. This stapler says Bea.

13:12.200 --> 13:16.725
Can't believe how well you're
taking it, me getting sacked.
Thought you'd hit the roof.

13:16.760 --> 13:21.840
I'm just tired, Donna. What
with your father and everything.
To be honest, I've given up on you.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.960
'..This further report
just in from Oliver Morgenstern.'

13:23.995 --> 13:25.965
There was this woman
who took control.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.240
Said she knew what to do, said she
could stop the MRI or something.

13:30.275 --> 13:32.765
Sarah Jane, her name was.
Sarah Jane Smith.

13:32.800 --> 13:38.440
Sarah Jane Smith was a freelance
investigative journalist,
formerly of Metropolitan Magazine.

13:38.475 --> 13:42.040
Her body was recovered from the
hospital late this afternoon...

13:42.075 --> 13:45.160
What's for tea? I've got nothing in.

13:45.195 --> 13:46.845
I'll get chips.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.725
Last of my wages.
Fish and chips, yeah?

13:50.760 --> 13:57.120
'..Along with his teenage friends
Maria Jackson and Clyde Langer. It is
feared that they also perished.'

14:25.440 --> 14:27.440
Blimey, you all right?!

14:28.520 --> 14:31.800
What was that, fireworks, or...?
I dunno. I was just...

14:31.835 --> 14:35.040
walking along. That's weird!

14:35.075 --> 14:37.125
You're the one...

14:37.160 --> 14:39.900
Christmas Eve, I met you, in town.

14:39.935 --> 14:42.605
Donna, isn't it? What was your name?

14:42.640 --> 14:46.720
How're you doing? You're looking
good. What you been up to?

14:46.755 --> 14:49.440
You're doing it again. What?

14:49.475 --> 14:51.245
Looking behind me.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.925
People keep on doing that.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.720
Looking at my back.
What sort of people?

14:55.755 --> 14:57.720
People in the street.

14:57.755 --> 14:59.285
Strangers.

14:59.320 --> 15:00.925
I just catch them, sometimes.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.620
Staring at me.
Like they're looking at something.

15:04.655 --> 15:08.280
And then I get home and I look
and there's nothing there.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.240
See? Look, now I'M doing it!
What are you doing for Christmas?

15:13.275 --> 15:15.325
What am I what?!

15:15.360 --> 15:17.440
Next Christmas. Any plans?

15:17.475 --> 15:19.937
I dunno, that's ages away!

15:19.972 --> 15:22.365
Nothing much, I suppose. Why?

15:22.400 --> 15:27.920
Just, I think you should get out,
you and your family. Don't stay
in London. Just leave the city.

15:27.955 --> 15:29.765
What for?

15:29.800 --> 15:32.685
Nice hotel. Christmas break?

15:32.720 --> 15:36.480
Can't afford it. Well, now,
you've got that raffle ticket.

15:36.515 --> 15:39.080
How d'you know about that?
First prize.

15:39.115 --> 15:41.457
Luxury weekend break.

15:41.492 --> 15:43.765
Use it, Donna Noble.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.720
Why won't you tell me your name?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.325
I think you

15:53.360 --> 15:55.120
should leave me alone.

16:07.520 --> 16:11.040
# Merry Xmas Everybody #
by Slade

16:11.075 --> 16:14.525
Cor blimey! That's what I call posh!

16:14.560 --> 16:17.845
I said you were lucky!
Didn't I always say, my lucky star?

16:17.880 --> 16:22.120
For God's sake, don't tell them that
we won it in a raffle. Be classy!

16:22.155 --> 16:25.445
Dad, take those things off.
No, I shan't, it's Christmas!

16:25.480 --> 16:30.320
I'll have that one, thank you,
it's got my liniment in it.
I reckon we deserve this.

16:30.355 --> 16:32.537
It's been a hell of a year.

16:32.572 --> 16:34.720
Your Dad would've loved this.

16:34.755 --> 16:36.285
Yeah.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.280
He would've.

16:45.720 --> 16:49.280
Oy! Gramps!
Get that, that'll be breakfast!

16:49.315 --> 16:53.045
We've got croissants!

16:53.080 --> 16:55.780
It's Christmas Day,
I never get up before ten.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.480
Only madam there
was up with the dawn chorus.

16:58.515 --> 17:03.445
Like when she was six years old!

17:03.480 --> 17:07.119
How was the sofa?
Oh, yeah, not so good, really.

17:09.119 --> 17:13.200
Oooh! You know we could've paid
for a second room.

17:13.234 --> 17:14.805
Oi!

17:14.839 --> 17:17.200
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas.

17:17.234 --> 17:19.420
Merry Christmas, Dad.

17:19.560 --> 17:23.405
All right! All right, my darlin'!
Grub's up! Merry Christmas!

17:23.440 --> 17:27.440
Merry Christmas, sir. 'We interrupt
this programme to bring you
breaking news.' Have you seen this?

17:27.474 --> 17:29.685
Nice early breakfast,
then we'll go for a walk.

17:29.720 --> 17:33.880
People always say that at Christmas,
'Oh, we all went for a walk',
I've always wanted to do that.

17:33.915 --> 17:37.437
So, walk first, presents later,
yeah? Donna, come and see.

17:37.472 --> 17:40.925
Tienes algo en tu espalda.
What? Donna, look at the telly.

17:40.960 --> 17:45.640
Tienes algo en tu espalda.
What does that mean?
I don't know what you're saying.

17:45.675 --> 17:48.440
Donna, look at the TV!
Tienes algo en tu espalda!

17:55.840 --> 17:59.725
For God's sake, Donna, don't just
stand there, come and look!

17:59.760 --> 18:05.360
'..This footage is live and genuine.
The object is falling
on Central London.'

18:05.395 --> 18:08.405
I repeat, this is not a hoax.
A replica of the Titanic

18:08.440 --> 18:12.300
is falling out of the sky and
it's heading for Buckingham Palace.

18:12.335 --> 18:16.160
We're getting this footage from
the Guinnevere range of satellites.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.480
Is that...a film or something?

18:20.640 --> 18:24.080
The Royal Air Force
has declared an emerg...

18:33.440 --> 18:35.885
It's gone dead.

18:35.920 --> 18:41.200
All of them. No, but the Titanic?!
Oh, don't be daft!

18:41.235 --> 18:43.840
Is that like a sequel?

18:43.875 --> 18:46.245
Oh...

18:46.280 --> 18:48.640
Oh, God rest their souls.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.040
I was supposed to be out there,
selling papers.

18:56.075 --> 18:58.640
I should've been there.
We all should.

18:58.675 --> 19:00.757
We'd be dead.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.805
That's everyone.

19:02.840 --> 19:05.840
Every single person we know.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.320
The whole city.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.005
Can't be.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.520
But it is. It's gone.

19:12.555 --> 19:14.845
London's gone.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.440
If you hadn't won that raffle...

19:24.120 --> 19:27.325
Leeds?! I'm not moving to Leeds!

19:27.360 --> 19:31.445
I'm afraid it's Leeds,
or you can wait in the hostel
for another three months.

19:31.480 --> 19:35.720
All I want is a washing machine.
What about Glasgow, I heard
there was jobs going in Glasgow.

19:35.755 --> 19:39.560
You can't pick and choose!
All of Southern England's
flooded with radiation,

19:39.595 --> 19:42.125
7 million people in need
of relocation,

19:42.160 --> 19:47.040
and now France has closed
its borders, so it's Leeds
or nothing. ..Next!

19:59.400 --> 20:06.165
The Daniels Family, billetted
at number 15. Mr & Mrs Obego,
billetted at number 31.

20:06.200 --> 20:11.880
Miss Coltrane, you're in number 8.
The Noble family, billetted
at number 29... That's us!

20:11.915 --> 20:14.480
Come on. Off we go, all right?

20:16.560 --> 20:20.405
Used to be a nice little family,
number 29.

20:20.440 --> 20:24.560
They missed one mortgage payment,
just one, they got booted out,
all for you lot.

20:24.595 --> 20:27.605
Don't get all chippy
with me, Vera Duckworth.

20:27.640 --> 20:31.320
Pop your clogs on and go and feed
t'whippets. Sweetheart, come on.

20:31.355 --> 20:35.120
You're not gonna make the world
any better by shouting at it.

20:35.155 --> 20:36.600
I can try.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.805
What happens, do we get keys?

20:44.840 --> 20:48.120
I don't know, do I?
Who do we ask, the soldiers?

20:48.155 --> 20:51.285
Hey-ey! Is a big house!

20:51.320 --> 20:54.685
Room for all! Welcome! In you come.

20:54.720 --> 20:59.000
I thought this was OUR house. Is
many people's house! Is wonderful!

20:59.035 --> 21:01.085
In! In! In!

21:01.120 --> 21:03.525
We've been here
for eight weeks already.

21:03.560 --> 21:07.220
I had a nice little paper shop
in Shepherd's Bush. All gone now.

21:07.255 --> 21:10.880
So, upstairs, we have the
Merchandani family, seven of them,

21:10.915 --> 21:13.205
good family, good kids.

21:13.240 --> 21:17.260
Except that one, be careful of him.

21:17.295 --> 21:21.245
That's a joking! Where's that smile?

21:21.280 --> 21:24.085
Rocco Colosanto, I'm here
with my wife, and her sister,

21:24.120 --> 21:28.440
and her husband, and their kids,
and their daughter's kids.
We've got the front room.

21:28.475 --> 21:32.640
My mother, she's got the back room.
She's old, you forgive.

21:32.675 --> 21:37.440
And this, this is you,
this is your palace!

21:40.280 --> 21:43.165
What d'you mean, this is us?
You live here!

21:43.200 --> 21:48.800
In the kitchen?! You got camp beds!
You got the cooker, you keep warm,
you got the fridge, you keep cool!

21:48.835 --> 21:50.765
Is good! What about the bathroom?

21:50.800 --> 21:54.200
Nobody lives in the bathroom!
No, I mean, is there a rota?

21:54.235 --> 21:56.805
Is pot luck! Is fun!

21:56.840 --> 22:00.120
I go wake Mamma,
she likes new people.

22:00.155 --> 22:03.400
Mamma! Is people! Nice people!

22:05.320 --> 22:07.325
Ah, well...

22:07.360 --> 22:10.080
We'll settle in, won't we? Make do.

22:10.115 --> 22:12.405
Bit of wartime spirit, eh?

22:12.440 --> 22:16.160
But there isn't a war.
There's no fight,

22:16.195 --> 22:17.600
There's just...

22:21.120 --> 22:27.480
It was on the news.
They're gonna send Great Britain
50 billion quid in financial aid!

22:27.515 --> 22:29.125
God bless America!

22:29.160 --> 22:33.405
America is in crisis
with over 60 million reported dead.

22:33.440 --> 22:37.860
Sixty million people have dissolved
into fat. And the fat is walking.

22:37.895 --> 22:42.280
People's fat has come to life and
is walking through the streets.

22:42.315 --> 22:44.365
And there are spaceships.

22:44.400 --> 22:50.440
There are reports of spaceships
over every major US city. The fat
is flying, it is leaving,...

22:50.475 --> 22:54.240
Aliens. Yeah.

22:56.040 --> 23:00.165
Mary McGinty, d'you remember her?

23:00.200 --> 23:05.200
Who was she? Worked in the
newsagent on a Sunday.

23:05.235 --> 23:07.717
Little woman, black hair.

23:07.752 --> 23:10.165
Never really spoke to her.

23:10.200 --> 23:14.640
She'll be dead.
Every day, I think of someone else.

23:14.675 --> 23:18.120
All dead.
Maybe she went away for Christmas.

23:18.155 --> 23:21.205
Maybe.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.880
I'll go out tomorrow,
I'll walk into town.

23:24.915 --> 23:26.777
There's got to be work.

23:26.812 --> 23:28.605
Everyone needs secretaries.

23:28.640 --> 23:32.160
Soon as I'm earning,
we'll get a proper place.

23:32.195 --> 23:33.725
Just you wait, Mum.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.960
What if it never gets better?

23:35.995 --> 23:37.485
Course it will.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.720
Even the bees are disappearing.

23:39.755 --> 23:41.920
You don't see bumble bees any more.

23:41.955 --> 23:44.045
They'll sort us out,

23:44.080 --> 23:46.165
the Emergency Government.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.040
They'll do something.
What if they don't?

23:50.120 --> 23:52.700
Then... we'll complain.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.280
Who's gonna listen to us?

23:55.315 --> 23:57.285
Refugees.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.680
We haven't even got a vote.

23:59.715 --> 24:02.040
We're just no-one, Donna.

24:02.075 --> 24:04.085
We don't exist.

24:04.120 --> 24:08.040
# ..And I spent all my money
on whisky and beer.. #

24:08.075 --> 24:11.160
I am going to kill that man!

24:13.240 --> 24:15.565
Now, listen, Mussolini!

24:15.600 --> 24:20.280
I am telling you, for the last time,
to button it!

24:20.315 --> 24:23.960
If I hear one more sea shanty...

24:27.080 --> 24:29.765
Always loved a sing-song.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.920
# ..I'm just a poor boy,
nobody loves me

24:32.955 --> 24:36.217
# He's just a poor boy
from a poor family

24:36.252 --> 24:39.480
# Spare him his life
from this monstrosity

24:39.515 --> 24:41.605
# Easy come, easy go

24:41.640 --> 24:44.440
# Will you let me go...? #

24:46.196 --> 24:49.000
You stay here!

24:49.035 --> 24:50.560
Everyone, stay!

24:53.640 --> 24:56.645
Hey! Firing at the car, is not
so good! You crazy or what?!

24:56.680 --> 25:00.080
It's this ATMOS thing, it won't
stop, it's like gas, it's toxic.

25:00.115 --> 25:01.965
Well, switch it off!

25:02.000 --> 25:07.560
I have done! It's still going!
It's all the cars, every single
ATMOS car! They've gone mad...

25:07.595 --> 25:10.597
You... lady, turn round.

25:10.632 --> 25:13.600
Turn around!
Are you crazy, boy? Now!

25:13.635 --> 25:16.440
Put that down! Turn round!

25:16.475 --> 25:17.565
Do what he says!

25:17.600 --> 25:19.440
Show me your back! Turn around!

25:19.475 --> 25:21.840
Show me your back!

25:24.800 --> 25:27.325
Sorry.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.125
I thought I saw...

25:29.160 --> 25:32.600
Call yourself a soldier?!
Pointing guns at innocent women!

25:32.635 --> 25:34.405
You're a disgrace!

25:34.440 --> 25:37.125
In my day, we'd have
had you court-martialled!

25:37.160 --> 25:41.120
Donna, where are you going?
It's not safe at night!

25:41.155 --> 25:43.440
Donna! Donna!

25:47.840 --> 25:48.920
Hello.

25:50.320 --> 25:51.685
Hi.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.005
It's the ATMOS devices.

25:54.040 --> 25:58.200
We're lucky, it's not so bad here,
Britain hasn't got that much petrol.

25:58.235 --> 26:00.277
But all over Europe...

26:00.312 --> 26:02.285
China, South Africa...

26:02.320 --> 26:05.120
They're getting choked by gas.

26:05.155 --> 26:06.725
Can't anyone stop it?

26:06.760 --> 26:12.720
Yeah, they're trying right now.
This little band of fighters,
on board the Sontaran ship.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.720
Any second now.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.525
And that was...?

26:32.560 --> 26:36.360
That was the Torchwood team.
Gwen Cooper,

26:36.395 --> 26:38.725
Ianto Jones, they gave their lives.

26:38.760 --> 26:44.280
And Captain Jack Harkness has
transported to the Sontaran
homeworld. There's no-one left.

26:46.520 --> 26:49.040
You're always wearing
the same clothes.

26:49.075 --> 26:52.277
Why won't you tell me your name?

26:52.312 --> 26:55.480
None of this was meant to happen.

26:55.515 --> 26:57.605
There was a man.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.685
This wonderful man.
And he stopped it.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.680
The Titanic, the Adipose, the ATMOS -
he stopped them all from happening.

27:04.715 --> 27:06.885
That...Doctor?

27:06.920 --> 27:09.360
You knew him. Did I?

27:09.395 --> 27:11.245
When?

27:11.280 --> 27:15.000
I think you dream about him
sometimes. It's a man in a suit.

27:15.035 --> 27:18.297
Tall, thin man. Great hair.

27:18.332 --> 27:21.560
Some really great hair.

27:21.595 --> 27:23.445
Who are you?

27:23.480 --> 27:26.325
I was like you. I used to be you.

27:26.360 --> 27:31.920
Cos you travelled with him, Donna,
you travelled with the Doctor in a
different world. I never met him.

27:31.955 --> 27:36.280
And he's dead. He died underneath
the Thames on Christmas Eve.
But you were meant to be there.

27:36.315 --> 27:38.160
He needed someone to stop
him, and that was you.

27:38.195 --> 27:41.160
You made him leave,
you saved his life.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.880
Arggh!

27:49.320 --> 27:52.045
Doctor! You can stop now!

27:52.080 --> 27:55.920
Stop it! I don't know what you're
talking about, leave me alone!

27:55.955 --> 27:58.680
Something's coming, Donna.
Something worse.

27:58.715 --> 28:01.885
The whole world is stinking.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.520
How could anything be worse
than this? Trust me.

28:04.555 --> 28:06.765
We need the Doctor more than ever.

28:06.800 --> 28:12.560
I've...I've been pulled across
from a different universe, because
every single universe is in danger.

28:12.595 --> 28:14.565
It's coming, Donna.

28:14.600 --> 28:19.480
It's coming from across the stars,
and nothing can stop it. What is?

28:19.515 --> 28:21.160
The darkness.

28:23.840 --> 28:27.960
Well, what d'you keep telling me
for? What am I supposed to do?!

28:27.995 --> 28:29.405
I'm nothing special.

28:29.440 --> 28:34.080
I mean... I'm not...
I'm nothing special. I'm a temp!

28:34.115 --> 28:36.725
I'm not even that! I'm nothing.

28:36.760 --> 28:40.960
Donna Noble,
you're the most important woman in
the whole of creation.

28:40.995 --> 28:44.337
Oh, don't.

28:44.372 --> 28:47.166
Just...don't.

28:47.201 --> 28:50.580
I'm tired.

28:50.615 --> 28:53.960
I'm so tired.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.440
Yeah, well,
blonde hair might work on the men,
but you ain't shifting me, lady!

29:03.475 --> 29:05.405
That's more like it.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.840
I've got plenty more.
You'll come with me.

29:08.875 --> 29:10.805
Only when you want to.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.045
You'll have a long wait, then.

29:13.080 --> 29:17.800
Not really, just three weeks.
Tell me, does your grandfather
still own that telescope?

29:19.160 --> 29:20.680
He never lets go of it.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.160
Three weeks' time.

29:23.760 --> 29:28.480
But you've got to be certain.
Cos when you come with me, Donna...
I'm sorry,

29:28.515 --> 29:29.960
so sorry, but...

29:31.720 --> 29:33.920
..you're going to die.

29:49.720 --> 29:53.560
And you! I'll gonna miss you
most of all!

29:53.595 --> 29:56.217
All flame-haired and fiery!

29:56.252 --> 29:58.805
Oh, but why d'you have to go?

29:58.840 --> 30:01.325
It's the new law!
England for the English, et cetera.

30:01.360 --> 30:05.200
They can't send us home, the oceans
are closed, they build labour camps!

30:05.235 --> 30:08.920
I know, but labour doing what?
There aren't any jobs.

30:08.955 --> 30:12.685
Sewing, digging - is good!

30:12.720 --> 30:17.040
Now, stop it
before I kiss you too much...

30:18.080 --> 30:20.040
Wilfred!

30:20.075 --> 30:22.000
My capitano!

30:36.040 --> 30:38.680
It'll be quiet with him gone.

30:38.715 --> 30:41.320
Still, we'll have more room.

30:41.355 --> 30:43.245
Labour camps.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.800
That's what they called them
last time.

30:45.835 --> 30:47.040
What d'you mean?

30:53.360 --> 30:55.320
What is?

30:58.040 --> 31:01.685
'Scuse me!

31:01.720 --> 31:03.840
'Scuse me, where
are you taking them?

31:03.875 --> 31:05.757
Where are you going?

31:05.792 --> 31:08.176
Where are you going?

31:08.211 --> 31:10.485
Where are you going?!

31:10.520 --> 31:12.760
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

31:32.920 --> 31:34.765
With the army.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.440
They said I wasn't qualified.

31:40.840 --> 31:44.240
You were right. You said I should
have worked harder at school.

31:50.360 --> 31:53.120
Suppose I've always
been a disappointment.

31:53.155 --> 31:54.720
Yeah.

32:09.560 --> 32:13.520
You know we'd get a bit of cash if
we sold this thing. Don't you dare.

32:15.120 --> 32:20.240
I always imagined, your old age...
I'd have put a bit of money by.

32:20.275 --> 32:22.640
Make you comfy.

32:22.675 --> 32:24.565
Never did.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.600
I'm just useless.

32:29.360 --> 32:32.240
You're supposed to say,
"No, you're not."

32:32.275 --> 32:34.845
Ah, it must be the alignment...

32:34.880 --> 32:39.080
What's wrong? Well, I dunno,
I mean it can't be the lens
cos I was looking at Orion,

32:39.115 --> 32:41.205
the constellation of Orion.

32:41.240 --> 32:44.880
You take a look. Now, tell me,
what can you see? Where?

32:44.915 --> 32:46.600
Well, up there, in the sky!

32:48.880 --> 32:51.245
Well, I can't see anything.
It's just black.

32:51.280 --> 32:55.080
Well, I mean it's working.
The telescope is working.

32:55.115 --> 32:57.680
Well, maybe it's the clouds.
There's no clouds.

32:57.715 --> 32:59.605
Well, there must be! There's not!

32:59.640 --> 33:04.600
It was there,
an entire constellation.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.965
Look!

33:08.000 --> 33:11.245
Look there.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.560
They're going out.

33:12.595 --> 33:15.165
Oh, my God!

33:15.200 --> 33:18.440
Donna, the stars are going out.

33:26.120 --> 33:28.240
I'm ready.

33:45.931 --> 33:48.600
'Loadstone testing now at 15.4,

33:48.635 --> 33:50.800
'repeat 15.4.'

33:53.360 --> 33:56.085
Ma'am. I've told you, don't salute.

33:56.120 --> 33:59.400
Well, if you're not going
to tell us your name...
What, you don't know either?

33:59.435 --> 34:01.485
I've crossed too many
different realities.

34:01.520 --> 34:06.280
Trust me, the wrong word
in the wrong place can change
an entire causal nexus.

34:06.315 --> 34:08.976
She talks like that. A lot.

34:09.012 --> 34:11.605
And you must be...Miss Noble.

34:11.639 --> 34:14.840
Donna. Captain Erisa Magambo.
Thank you for this.

34:14.875 --> 34:18.040
I don't even know what I'm doing.
Is it awake?

34:18.074 --> 34:20.440
Seems to be quiet, today.
Ticking over.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.377
Like it's waiting.

34:22.411 --> 34:24.280
D'you want to see it?

34:26.000 --> 34:28.205
What's a "police box"?

34:28.239 --> 34:34.040
They salvaged it from underneath
the Thames. Just go inside. What for?
Just go in.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.159
No way!

35:24.040 --> 35:25.400
What d'you think?

35:27.640 --> 35:29.925
Can I have a coffee?

35:29.960 --> 35:32.360
Time And Relative Dimension
in Space.

35:32.395 --> 35:34.760
This room used to shine with light.

35:34.795 --> 35:36.400
I think it's dying.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.045
It's still trying to help.

35:44.080 --> 35:50.165
And...it belonged to the Doctor?
He was a Time Lord. Last of his kind.

35:50.200 --> 35:55.765
But if he was so special,
what was he doing with me?
He thought you were brilliant.

35:55.800 --> 36:00.800
Don't be stupid. But you are.
It just took the Doctor to show you
that, simply by being with him.

36:00.835 --> 36:04.720
to everyone he touches.

36:06.920 --> 36:09.320
Were you and him...?

36:17.320 --> 36:20.600
D'you want to see it? No.

36:24.800 --> 36:30.200
Go on, then. We don't know how the
TARDIS works, but we've managed to
scrape off the surface technology,

36:30.235 --> 36:31.920
enough to show you the creature.

36:31.955 --> 36:33.637
It's a creature?

36:33.672 --> 36:35.285
Just stand here.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.120
Out of the circle, please.

36:38.155 --> 36:40.485
Yes, ma'am.

36:40.520 --> 36:43.240
Can't you stay with me?

36:43.275 --> 36:44.765
Ready?

36:44.800 --> 36:47.560
And...activate.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.520
Open your eyes, Donna. Is it there?

36:56.555 --> 36:59.045
Open your eyes. Look at it.

36:59.080 --> 37:02.120
I can't. It's part of you,
Donna. Look.

37:11.720 --> 37:16.320
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, calm down!
Donna, Donna, Donna! OK.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.980
What is it?

37:28.015 --> 37:30.667
We don't know.

37:30.702 --> 37:32.831
Oh...thanks(!)

37:32.866 --> 37:34.925
It feeds off time.

37:34.960 --> 37:38.440
By changing time, by making
someone's life take a different turn,

37:38.475 --> 37:41.120
like, er, meetings never made,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.645
a life never loved.

37:46.680 --> 37:49.725
But with you it's...
I never did anything important.

37:49.760 --> 37:53.565
Yes, you did. One day, that thing
made you turn right, instead of left.

37:53.600 --> 37:57.725
When was that?
You wouldn't remember. It was the
most ordinary day in the world.

37:57.760 --> 38:03.000
But by turning right, you never
met the Doctor. And the whole
world just changed around you.

38:03.035 --> 38:05.377
Can you get rid of it?

38:05.412 --> 38:07.685
I can't even touch it.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.680
Seems to be in a state of flux.

38:09.715 --> 38:12.600
What does that mean?

38:12.635 --> 38:14.085
I don't know.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.520
Sort of thing the Doctor would say.

38:16.555 --> 38:18.965
You liar!

38:19.000 --> 38:21.405
You told me I was special.

38:21.440 --> 38:25.720
But it's not me, it's this thing -
I'm just a host!

38:25.880 --> 38:28.100
No, there's more than that...

38:28.135 --> 38:30.285
The readings are strange.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.845
It's like reality is just
bending around you.

38:32.880 --> 38:37.405
Because of this thing! No, no, we're
getting separate readings from you.

38:37.440 --> 38:42.400
And they've always been there,
since the day you were born. This is
not relevant to the mission.

38:42.435 --> 38:45.245
I thought it was just
the Doctor we needed,

38:45.280 --> 38:49.240
but it's the both of you.
The Doctor and Donna Noble. Together.

38:49.275 --> 38:52.280
To stop the stars from going out.

38:52.315 --> 38:53.760
Why?

38:54.920 --> 38:57.160
What can I do?

39:02.960 --> 39:05.460
Turn it off! Please.

39:05.495 --> 39:07.960
Captain. Power down.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.480
It's still there, though.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.400
What can I do...

39:23.435 --> 39:25.765
to get rid of it?

39:25.800 --> 39:27.845
You're going to travel in time!

39:27.880 --> 39:30.200
The TARDIS has tracked down
the moment of intervention -

39:30.235 --> 39:32.485
Monday the 25th, one minute past
ten in the morning.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.920
Your car was on Little Sutton Street,
leading to the Ealing Road,

39:34.955 --> 39:36.565
but you turned right,
heading for Griffin's Parade.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.540
You need to turn left. You've
got to go back, turn left.
Have you got that, Donna?

39:40.575 --> 39:44.480
One minute past ten,
make yourself turn left,
heading for the Chiswick High Road.

39:44.515 --> 39:47.680
Keep the jacket on at all
times - it's insulation
against temporal feedback.

39:47.715 --> 39:50.320
This will correspond to
local time wherever you land.

39:50.355 --> 39:52.720
This is to combat dehydration.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.040
This is where we leave you. I don't
want to see that thing on my back.

40:05.075 --> 40:07.365
No, the mirrors are just incidental.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.980
They bounce chronon
energy back into the centre,

40:10.015 --> 40:12.560
which we control
and decide the destination.

40:12.595 --> 40:14.477
It's a time machine.

40:14.512 --> 40:16.360
It's a time machine.

40:16.395 --> 40:17.480
If you could...

40:23.880 --> 40:25.680
Powering up!

40:30.440 --> 40:33.245
How d'you know it's gonna work? Hmm?

40:33.280 --> 40:38.320
Oh, we...we don't.
We're...we're just guessing.

40:39.760 --> 40:42.005
Brilliant(!)

40:42.040 --> 40:46.600
Just remember, when you
get to the junction, change the car's
direction by one minute past ten.

40:46.635 --> 40:48.960
How do I do that? It's up to you.

40:48.995 --> 40:52.045
Well...I'll just have to...

40:52.080 --> 40:55.200
run up to myself
and...have a good argument.

40:55.235 --> 40:58.320
I'd like to see that.
Activate lodestone.

41:01.480 --> 41:02.765
Good luck.

41:02.800 --> 41:05.760
I'm ready! One minute past ten.

41:05.795 --> 41:07.725
Cos I understand now!

41:07.760 --> 41:15.040
You said I was gonna die,
but you mean this whole world,
it's gonna blink out of existence...

41:15.075 --> 41:20.800
but that's not dying,
cos a better world takes its place.
The Doctor's world!

41:20.835 --> 41:22.760
And I'm still alive!

41:24.880 --> 41:28.360
That's right, isn't it? I don't die.
If I change things, I don't die.

41:28.395 --> 41:32.240
That's...that's right, isn't it?

41:35.200 --> 41:36.925
I'm sorry.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.520
But I can't die!

41:39.555 --> 41:42.045
I've got a future!

41:42.080 --> 41:45.440
With the Doctor - you told me!

41:46.320 --> 41:47.440
Activate!

42:20.440 --> 42:22.805
But...

42:22.840 --> 42:25.960
Hold on... But this is...

42:25.995 --> 42:28.405
I'm not...

42:28.440 --> 42:30.760
This is Sutton Court!

42:33.160 --> 42:35.480
I'M HALF A MILE AWAY!

42:38.840 --> 42:40.740
Four minutes.

42:40.775 --> 42:42.640
Oh, my God!

42:46.480 --> 42:53.120
Jival Chowdry, he runs that little
photocopy business in Merchant
Street

42:53.155 --> 42:54.560
and he needs a secretary.

42:54.595 --> 42:56.160
I've got a job!

43:03.720 --> 43:08.920
HC Clements is in the city.
It's nice, it's posh,

43:08.955 --> 43:10.800
so stop it!

43:20.360 --> 43:23.000
It won't take long,
just turn right.

43:25.680 --> 43:30.200
I'm going left - if you don't
like it, get out and walk!

43:30.235 --> 43:31.965
You think I'm so useless.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.200
Oh, I know why you want a
job with HC Clements, lady.

43:35.235 --> 43:36.800
Cos you think you'll meet a man.

43:44.280 --> 43:46.760
I'm not gonna get there.

43:50.400 --> 43:52.320
You're gonna die.

43:59.360 --> 44:03.480
City executives don't need temps -
except for practice.

44:04.728 --> 44:05.697
Yeah.

44:05.732 --> 44:07.880
Suppose you're right.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.760
Please.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.205
Argh!

44:20.240 --> 44:22.805
Can you hear that?

44:22.840 --> 44:26.040
Oh, no! Go back! Oi! Get a move on!

44:27.840 --> 44:31.040
The traffic's stopping.
Something must've happened.

44:39.600 --> 44:42.120
Tell him this.

44:42.155 --> 44:44.640
Two words.

44:54.680 --> 44:57.880
Well, that decides it.
I'm not sitting in a traffic jam.

44:57.915 --> 45:01.760
I'm going left!

45:01.795 --> 45:04.297
Ah...!

45:04.332 --> 45:06.765
'Left...

45:06.800 --> 45:08.600
'Left...left...'

45:20.895 --> 45:23.525
What the hell is that?!

45:23.560 --> 45:28.560
You were so strong. What are you?

45:28.595 --> 45:30.997
What will you be?

45:31.032 --> 45:33.400
What will you be?

45:36.320 --> 45:38.600
Everything all right?

45:38.635 --> 45:40.160
Oh, God...!

45:41.560 --> 45:43.760
What was that for?!

45:43.795 --> 45:45.280
I don't know!

45:53.200 --> 45:55.100
Can't remember.

45:55.135 --> 45:56.965
It's slipping away.

45:57.000 --> 46:01.880
You know, like when you think of a
dream, and it sort of goes.

46:01.915 --> 46:03.445
Just got lucky, this thing.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.820
It's one of the Trickster's Brigade.

46:05.855 --> 46:08.125
Changes a life in tiny little ways.

46:08.160 --> 46:11.720
Most times, the universe just
compensates around it,
but with you...

46:11.755 --> 46:15.205
great big parallel world!

46:15.240 --> 46:18.360
Hold on, you said
parallel worlds are sealed off.

46:18.395 --> 46:21.445
They are.
But you had one created around you.

46:21.480 --> 46:25.640
Funny thing is...
seems to be happening a lot. To you.

46:25.675 --> 46:27.285
How d'you mean?

46:27.320 --> 46:29.725
Well, the Library. Then this.

46:29.760 --> 46:32.925
Just goes with the job, I suppose.

46:32.960 --> 46:36.520
Sometimes I think there's way too
much coincidence around you, Donna.

46:36.555 --> 46:40.080
I met you once. Then I met your
grandfather. Then I met you again.

46:40.115 --> 46:43.800
In the whole wide universe,
I met you for a second time.

46:43.835 --> 46:47.217
It's like
something's binding us together.

46:47.252 --> 46:50.600
Don't be so daft.
I'm nothing special.

46:50.635 --> 46:53.317
Yes, you are, you're brilliant.

46:53.352 --> 46:56.000
He thought you were brilliant.

46:56.035 --> 46:58.400
SHE said that.

46:58.435 --> 47:00.257
Who did?

47:00.292 --> 47:02.045
That woman.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.620
I can't remember...

47:03.655 --> 47:05.227
She never existed, now.

47:05.262 --> 47:06.800
No, but she said...

47:06.835 --> 47:08.360
The stars...

47:10.560 --> 47:12.525
She said the stars are going out.

47:12.560 --> 47:16.040
Yeah, but that world's gone.
No, but she said it was all worlds.

47:16.075 --> 47:17.925
Every world.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.520
She said the darkness is coming.

47:20.555 --> 47:22.765
Even here. Who was she?

47:22.800 --> 47:25.360
I don't know.
What did she look like?

47:25.395 --> 47:27.337
She was...

47:27.372 --> 47:29.245
blonde.

47:29.280 --> 47:32.240
What was her name? I don't know.
Donna, what was her name?

47:34.560 --> 47:36.240
But she told me...

47:36.275 --> 47:37.725
to warn you.

47:37.760 --> 47:39.845
She said...two words.

47:39.880 --> 47:42.760
What two words? What were they?
What did she say?

47:47.520 --> 47:49.320
"Bad Wolf."

47:51.240 --> 47:52.720
What does it mean?

48:14.640 --> 48:18.160
Doctor, what is it? What's Bad Wolf?

48:19.520 --> 48:22.360
It's the end of the universe.

48:35.320 --> 48:37.940
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

48:37.975 --> 48:40.847
It can't be.
There's nothing I can do.

48:40.882 --> 48:43.720
Oh, my God!
What is it, who are they?

48:43.755 --> 48:45.560
What are we going to do?

48:45.595 --> 48:47.477
It's impossible.

48:47.512 --> 48:49.325
It can't be!

48:49.360 --> 48:52.240
I'm sorry, we're dead.
Doctor, come back!

48:53.280 --> 48:55.120
It's only just beginning.
