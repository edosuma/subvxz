IT'S KIND OF
A LIGHTHEADEDNESS,
I GUESS.

"THE RUINOUS ROMANCE

EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS
THAT SHE HAD.

THAT IT WAS CAUSED

DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE

27:00.912 --> 27:03.415
TO GIVE ME ANYTHING
THAT WOULD WORK.

27:03.581 --> 27:06.751
ACTUALLY, I DON'T
THINK THAT HE KNEW WHAT
IT WAS THAT I HAVE.

27:06.918 --> 27:09.879

27:32.902 --> 27:34.237
WHY NOT?

27:34.404 --> 27:36.281
WELL, UH...BECAUSE
I HAD THE VAPORS,

27:36.448 --> 27:39.200
AND, UH...
IT WAS CURED.

27:39.367 --> 27:43.955

BUT OF COURSE,
IT IS NOT CHEAP.

SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME.
SHE'S CALLING FOR YOU.

42:06.275 --> 42:07.860
SHE'S DR. LOGAN'S
PATIENT.

42:08.027 --> 42:08.986
WE CAN'T FIND HIM.

42:09.153 --> 42:09.987
WHO'S WITH HER?

42:10.154 --> 42:10.988
CAROLINE.

42:11.155 --> 42:12.656
THEN SHE'S
IN GOOD HANDS.

42:12.823 --> 42:14.533

SOMETHING WRONG.

42:14.700 --> 42:15.743
SHE'S AFRAID.

42:15.910 --> 42:16.827
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

42:16.994 --> 42:18.746
I'M NOT A DOCTOR
ANYMORE!

42:18.913 --> 42:21.457
IF YOU'RE NOT A DOCTOR,
WHAT ARE YOU? YOU'RE NOT
A FARMER, WE KNOW THAT.

42:21.624 --> 42:23.792
I'M THE MAN WHO LET
STANLEY NOVACK DIE!

42:23.959 --> 42:25.711
AW, COME ON, DOC!
STANLEY'S DYING
WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME
OR THE EQUIPMENT TO--

42:27.379 --> 42:30.049
A BETTER DOCTOR
WOULD'VE SAVED HIM!

42:30.216 --> 42:32.009
ALL RIGHT! YOU'RE NOT
A MIRACLE WORKER.

42:32.176 --> 42:34.637
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT EVEN
THE BEST DOCTOR IN THE WORLD.

42:34.803 --> 42:37.932
BUT SHE DOESN'T NEED
THE BEST DOCTOR IN THE WORLD.
SHE NEEDS YOU.

42:38.098 --> 42:40.017
SHE NEEDS SOMEBODY
SHE CAN BELIEVE IN,

42:40.184 --> 42:44.688
SOMEBODY SHE BELIEVES
CARES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS
TO HER AND HER BABY.

42:44.855 --> 42:46.565
I'M SORRY.

42:46.732 --> 42:48.859

BE SORRY TOMORROW.

IS TAKING CARE OF BETH.

42:52.446 --> 42:54.240
AND YOU'RE GONNA
DO IT, DOC.

42:54.406 --> 42:55.741
SHE'S YOUR PATIENT.

42:55.908 --> 42:57.534
YOU STARTED WITH HER,
AND YOU'RE GONNA FINISH.

42:57.701 --> 42:59.787
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S
JUST YOUR BEING THERE.

42:59.954 --> 43:03.666

THE MOST IMPORTANT
MOMENT IN HER LIFE.

IT'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT NOW.

SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN?

44:35.758 --> 44:36.717
NO! NO!

44:36.884 --> 44:40.346
NO. I WANT TO BE AWAKE
TO SEE MY BABY.
