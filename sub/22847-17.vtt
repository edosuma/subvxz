00:01.502 --> 00:03.879
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.338 --> 00:06.507
Talbot already gave up
the location of the chamber.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.426
<i>Yes, and we're waiting
for Strucker to show us</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:09.510
<i>how to put it together.</i>

00:09.760 --> 00:13.139
My father kept everything separate.
There's no single journal

00:13.222 --> 00:15.891
- that explains how the chamber works.
- We may be running out of time.

00:16.058 --> 00:20.938
My mother wanted to join forces with
S.H.I.E.L.D., with Daisy Johnson.

00:21.147 --> 00:23.190
The gravitonium is meant for you.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.735
- We have to find...
- Phillip J. Coulson.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.154
Okay, let's start searching
for landmarks that might match.

00:28.487 --> 00:29.572
It won't be easy...

00:29.697 --> 00:31.198
...but that might be where he is.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.035
Daisy's taking a long shot to find
where Hale is keeping Coulson,

00:34.201 --> 00:36.829
but we have something concrete that
can get us one step ahead of her.

00:36.996 --> 00:39.582
Hale may be after a weapon
powered by gravitonium,

00:39.749 --> 00:42.376
probably in a location that Malick
turned over to S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.588
We have coordinates to three locations,
so, we'll start with the closest

00:45.755 --> 00:47.465
and hope we don't find company
when we get there.

00:47.631 --> 00:48.966
Creel has broken out Talbot and Coulson.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.468
Gear up and stop them.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.387
Here we go.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.516
We're on Earth, right?

01:17.244 --> 01:18.579
<i>Feels good to be home.</i>

01:21.248 --> 01:23.209
Just didn't think it'd be under
these circumstances.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.336
- Did you pack the explosives?
- I did.

01:25.503 --> 01:27.713
- And the extra ammunition?
- Of course.

01:28.339 --> 01:29.673
I just want this to work.

01:30.466 --> 01:32.134
After everything we've done
to get here.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.428
You made a choice. Don't look back.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.641
What are the chances
that we find this weapon here?

01:40.476 --> 01:44.146
Gideon Malick hinted that this place
was a crucial R&D site for Hydra.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.357
It's our best bet, by far.

01:46.941 --> 01:49.235
Autopilot will land
the Quinjet somewhere nearby.

01:50.486 --> 01:52.154
Keep it cloaked until we get back.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.824
- Ready if you are.
- So ready.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.543
I was thinking we could come back
to England for our honeymoon,

02:05.918 --> 02:08.169
- if we ever got one.
- Sounds perfect!

02:08.628 --> 02:10.589
Don't make me the third wheel, guys.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.640
No trouble with the straps this time.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.060
We've come a long way!

02:58.262 --> 02:59.638
I got to take five.

03:01.015 --> 03:03.392
No, no, no. No, no, no.
We could've been followed.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.853
- We can't stop now. Come on.
- Come on. What do you care?

03:06.103 --> 03:07.980
You left me alone for months, Phil.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.025
I'm sure you can manage another
couple of minutes, can't you?

03:13.444 --> 03:15.279
Don't jump down his throat.
He's all you got.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.491
For what it's worth, I'm sorry
we didn't find you sooner.

03:20.159 --> 03:21.202
Now come on.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.287
Just trying to hold out, Phil.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.081
- Where were you?
- We were in the future.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.335
You were in...
You were in the future?

03:30.002 --> 03:33.589
Where do you guys live,
in some fifth-dimension freak show?

03:34.798 --> 03:36.508
I'd say that's a relatively
accurate description

03:36.675 --> 03:38.510
- of our day-to-day life.
- Yeah, well, not mine.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.640
If we get out of here, I'm...
I'm done! I'm too jumbled as it is.

03:42.806 --> 03:43.807
Hey.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.393
You gonna let someone like Hale
get the best of you?

03:46.560 --> 03:47.561
Huh?

03:48.187 --> 03:49.813
She broke me, Phil.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.942
I let down the Air Force...

03:53.567 --> 03:54.777
my country...

03:55.694 --> 03:57.196
and I let down my family.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.158
I... I'm never gonna be able
to look Carla in the eye again.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.702
Hey, hey, hey. I promise you...

04:04.536 --> 04:07.373
- no one's gonna see it that way.
- Yeah? Well, I do.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.877
It's kind of a moot point if we
freeze to death out here, isn't it?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.545
That's why we got to keep moving.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.616
We're never gonna find them.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.327
We have been circling
the Trident Range

05:26.493 --> 05:27.870
for hours and there's still no sign
of Coulson

05:28.078 --> 05:29.830
- and whoever he's with.
- Well, that's a surprise,

05:29.997 --> 05:31.749
considering we're following
such a detailed map.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.834
Robin's been right
about everything else.

05:34.043 --> 05:35.669
Yeah, well, what if this
doesn't happen

05:35.836 --> 05:39.048
for another month or... or a year?
Would it kill her to draw a calendar?

05:39.131 --> 05:41.258
- Why don't you go ask her?
- Well, I thought that I left all this

05:41.342 --> 05:44.261
- prophecy crap back in the future...
- Deke, you're not helping.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.473
Maybe we should change the tactics.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.183
What are you thinking?

05:49.350 --> 05:50.934
The cloud cover's too thick
to see through, anyway.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.479
We should land, canvass the area
on foot, let Coulson find us.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.731
Hale's hideout could be nearby.
We'd be exposed.

05:55.898 --> 05:56.899
Give him a shot.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.070
If you think it's the right call.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.654
Davis,

06:02.946 --> 06:05.407
- find a place to set her down.
- Okay. Where'd you have in mind?

06:05.741 --> 06:06.742
Anywhere.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.660
We should start looking
for shelter.

06:09.078 --> 06:10.329
Maybe get a fire going.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.873
Were you ever a Boy Scout?

06:13.374 --> 06:14.458
Brigadier General outranks

06:14.625 --> 06:16.043
a Boy Scout, Coulson.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.423
Run!

06:34.269 --> 06:36.021
No, come on. We got to keep moving.
Come on.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.573
- You got your powers back.
- It's a long story.

06:46.782 --> 06:48.909
May, get them back to the Zephyr.
I'll take care of her.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.620
- Not a chance.
- It's a rescue mission. Look at them.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.920
- So, how'd you find us?
- Robin.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.798
A little bit like cheating,
don't you think?

07:03.507 --> 07:07.219
- Keep moving.
- Deke, watch their back. That's an order.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.524
Oh.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.569
The legendary Quake.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.615
You know, you're...
much prettier in person.

07:29.491 --> 07:30.534
And meaner,

07:30.742 --> 07:32.828
- so I'd stay where you are.
- It's funny.

07:33.620 --> 07:37.541
I have your poster up on my wall.
You're like that, uh...

07:38.333 --> 07:39.334
hero...

07:39.918 --> 07:42.087
that every little girl wants
to be when they grow up.

07:42.421 --> 07:46.216
Hm. Looks like you made
a wrong turn along the way.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.051
No.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.597
I'm just engineered differently.

07:52.431 --> 07:53.682
I don't want to be you.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.143
I want to beat you.

07:58.729 --> 07:59.938
You can certainly try.

08:50.656 --> 08:51.907
I don't think she's getting up
from that.

08:52.032 --> 08:52.991
What are you still doing here?

08:53.075 --> 08:54.576
Well, I thought
she had you for a sec, but...

08:57.329 --> 08:58.622
Deke!

09:00.749 --> 09:02.626
We got to get out of here. Let's go.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.386
I need an extraction team
at this location.

09:38.704 --> 09:39.788
Get this plane in the air.

09:41.707 --> 09:42.833
We got you.

09:55.304 --> 09:58.307
I can't stop the bleeding.
Grab the haemostatic granules.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.689
- It's okay.
- Oh, come on.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.358
- Scissors.
- Hope this thing has instructions.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.194
Yeah.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.613
Yeah.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.115
- Okay, hold him still.
- That's not a good sign.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.913
- It's working.
- This is only a temporary fix.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.624
He's gonna need actual medical attention.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.584
Call ahead to Simmons.
Give her a heads-up.

10:25.751 --> 10:27.711
No one's answering.
Can you hold on until we make it

10:27.878 --> 10:29.046
- to the Lighthouse?
- Just get us there

10:29.212 --> 10:30.213
as fast as you can.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.723
It's about damn time.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.726
The code is 6-2-8-8-2.

10:45.228 --> 10:48.231
- What the hell? Is Fitz evil again?
- Yo-Yo and Simmons broke him out.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.901
What? Why? Where did they go?

11:00.619 --> 11:02.371
Looks like there may be a way in up here.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.589
Radiation poisoning
would be a horrible way

11:12.756 --> 11:15.467
to find out we can still die.
Should we turn back?

11:15.884 --> 11:19.513
No need. Primula vulgaris. Primrose.
I used to pick these as a girl.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.682
I mean, it's a hardy species,

11:21.848 --> 11:24.059
but even it couldn't survive
in irradiated soil.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.731
You'll find more radiation
in a dentist's office.

11:41.410 --> 11:44.746
Talbot probably just posted
these signs to keep out interlopers.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.581
They won't scare off Hydra.

11:59.886 --> 12:00.887
Let me.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.019
Wow. Looks like getting
your arms chopped off isn't all bad.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.816
The... well, yeah...yeah...
it's b... Obviously, it's bad.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.026
It's really bad getting
your arms chopped off, but...

12:15.569 --> 12:18.113
- maybe there is a silver lining...
- Well, as much as I'm enjoying

12:18.280 --> 12:20.323
this day in the country,
we have a job to do.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.368
After you, better half.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.711
Here, take these.

12:34.713 --> 12:35.714
We're landing soon.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.144
That was reckless back there, Deke.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.480
You this kind to everybody
who takes a bullet for you?

12:51.563 --> 12:53.774
- You were the reason we had to retreat.
- Well, I'm sorry.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.067
Next time, I'll try to keep
all my blood inside of my body.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.403
I had Hale's daughter down for the count.
We could've captured her.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.906
Yeah, she was down
and I was trying to secure her weapon,

13:01.072 --> 13:03.325
- like any other agent would have.
- You're not an agent.

13:03.492 --> 13:04.659
Oh, really? Well, then maybe

13:04.868 --> 13:06.870
you should stop ordering me
around like one, then.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.539
Because this top-dog thing
doesn't suit you.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.416
What does it matter if you don't listen?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.043
I can't fight
and protect your dumb ass

13:13.210 --> 13:14.961
- at the same time.
- You are the worst. I...

13:15.086 --> 13:17.214
- I was trying to give you backup...
- I didn't need your backup, Deke!

13:17.339 --> 13:19.549
...even though you threatened
to kill me a couple of dozen times I...

13:23.094 --> 13:25.138
Here. Have some water. Deke?

13:27.474 --> 13:28.809
Deke?

13:29.726 --> 13:31.102
We need help over here!

13:31.561 --> 13:32.604
Now!

13:34.731 --> 13:36.775
Mack, where have you been?
Get Simmons. We need her.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.693
She's not here. She and Yo-Yo
locked me in Fitz's cell

13:38.860 --> 13:40.403
- and ran off to who knows where.
- Fitz's cell?

13:40.570 --> 13:41.655
Must be the long story you mentioned.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.406
Yeah. I left you in charge.
What the hell happened?

13:43.490 --> 13:44.616
Well, they think
they can't be killed.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.409
You try arguing with someone
who's totally irrational.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.495
We'll decide who's rational later.
What are we gonna do for Deke?

13:48.662 --> 13:49.663
He's coughing up blood.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.414
If Simmons is AWOL,
we have to get him to a hospital.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.750
We don't have time for that.
Piper, you were in training

13:53.834 --> 13:55.168
to be a field medic for the strike team.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.253
What are we looking at?

13:56.378 --> 13:58.964
Uh... He's in shock. If he doesn't get
a blood transfusion soon...

13:59.256 --> 14:01.633
- No choice. Treat him here.
- I have zero field experience.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.677
- There's no way. I'm not a surgeon.
- Just talk me through it.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.554
I'm not afraid of blood
and I got a steady hand.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.807
You should put some ice on that.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.016
That's not necessary.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.352
- I need you at your best.
- When am I not?

14:12.936 --> 14:14.479
You know, I could've beaten
Daisy Johnson today

14:14.646 --> 14:15.772
if you hadn't forced her to run.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.108
Too much of a risk.
She's got an unfair advantage.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.360
Once we complete our objective,
you'll be able to beat her

14:20.527 --> 14:22.946
- without breaking a sweat.
- So, move up the timetable, then.

14:23.154 --> 14:25.782
No, not until Creel tells us more
about the gravitonium.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.158
Now get in.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.580
- Are you serious?
- You went against my orders,

14:31.746 --> 14:32.789
nearly murdered Creel.

14:33.081 --> 14:36.209
- We need him for this.
- For what? He's dangerous.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.671
- He's completely out of your control.
- Yes, as are you.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.424
That's why I'm putting
you both back in your cage.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.139
Do I need to force you?

15:30.931 --> 15:33.642
Power's being diverted
to a space on the second floor,

15:33.808 --> 15:35.352
but according to this plan,
there's nothing there.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.772
Bad guys rarely mark
their evil lairs on blueprints.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.774
We'll find a way to locate it
once we get inside.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.693
- We may have to improvise that bit.
- We're improvising all the bits.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.946
Any idea what the weapon in there is?

15:46.363 --> 15:47.864
- We'll blow it up regardless.
- Hold on.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.494
- I'm reading an encrypted radio signal.
- Coming from where?

15:53.745 --> 15:55.121
Coming here. Move.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.559
Inside.

16:18.353 --> 16:21.398
Anton Ivanov is providing security.
Means we're in the right place.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.566
And that we've lost our advantage.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.236
A man who can't die, huh?

16:32.951 --> 16:34.744
Almost cleaned out.

16:43.586 --> 16:44.838
Okay. Where do we go from here?

16:45.380 --> 16:48.174
I... I think he has a haemothorax,
blood in his chest cavity.

16:48.425 --> 16:49.718
We need to stop the bleeding
and drain it.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.015
- Okay.
- You'll need to cut into the wound

16:55.181 --> 16:57.017
- so we can see what we're doing.
- What about anesthesia?

16:57.267 --> 16:59.394
Well, he's already unconscious
and I haven't read that chapter yet,

16:59.561 --> 17:00.937
so we'll just figure it out as we go.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.858
So, this kid's from the future?

17:06.151 --> 17:08.611
Yeah. And in that future, Earth is gone

17:08.819 --> 17:11.906
and the last of humanity is enslaved
by alien overlords.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.785
Alien over...

17:16.953 --> 17:18.913
I should've stayed in my cell.

17:20.707 --> 17:24.877
You're telling me that we got our asses
handed to us by little green men.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.546
They were big and blue.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.799
But they didn't crack
the world apart.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.218
They said it was Daisy.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.472
And you're still sending her on missions?

17:35.805 --> 17:37.348
I need her leading missions.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.059
I got an old injury acting up.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.603
Not sure what my timetable is exactly.

17:42.187 --> 17:43.855
Oh, for the love of flapjacks.

17:46.357 --> 17:47.942
Do you ever have any good news?

17:48.151 --> 17:50.195
There's a young Inhuman
who's seen a better future.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.155
We're working toward that.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.492
Anything else we can do for him?

17:56.534 --> 17:57.869
We're here if they need a hand.

17:59.662 --> 18:00.997
Can I talk to you for a second?

18:09.255 --> 18:11.174
We need to talk
about Fitz, Simmons and Yo-Yo.

18:11.341 --> 18:12.801
If they really believe
they can't be killed...

18:12.967 --> 18:14.886
That's not the conversation
we're having right now.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.056
Oh. Then, what conversation
are we having right now?

18:18.223 --> 18:20.642
Well, the one where you explain
all the stupid decisions

18:20.809 --> 18:22.977
- you've been making recently.
- That's rather specific.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.230
Giving yourself up to Hale was a mistake.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.564
She was about to blow up the Zephyr.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.191
- What did you want me to do?
- I don't know.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.443
Stall her long enough,
for me to get to the cockpit.

18:30.693 --> 18:33.029
You hold on while I throw
the plane into a vertical dive.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.240
- Maybe, knock out Creel...
- You gonna get to a point?

18:35.406 --> 18:39.953
My point is, you didn't even try.
You just rolled over without a fight.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.205
I did what I thought was best
and it got results.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.499
We rescued Talbot and learned
about Hale's agenda.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.543
Yeah, and nearly lost Deke
in the process.

18:46.709 --> 18:47.710
He should've listened to Daisy.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.337
Well, maybe Daisy
shouldn't have been put

18:49.504 --> 18:51.673
- in that position in the first place.
- You don't think she should lead?

18:51.881 --> 18:53.967
Uh-uh. I didn't say that.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.261
But she does need time.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.972
- She's questioning herself.
- I question myself every day...

18:59.139 --> 19:00.265
Let me speak.

19:02.308 --> 19:05.395
All Daisy could think
about was getting you back.

19:07.522 --> 19:08.982
She's not ready for your job, Phil.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.942
She has to be. My time is running out...

19:11.109 --> 19:13.570
Because you're being irresponsible.

19:13.736 --> 19:16.197
You said you weren't in a hurry to die,
but you're not acting like it.

19:16.364 --> 19:19.075
So, this isn't so much about my stupidity
as it is about me dying.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.743
Seems like one thing led to the other.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.872
You realise this isn't easy for me,
but I've accepted it.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.206
Which is the problem.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.208
Maybe I'm reckless...

19:28.084 --> 19:31.171
but if this is the end, better to go out
doing something that matters.

19:31.379 --> 19:32.255
No.

19:32.547 --> 19:35.049
You don't get to make that decision alone.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.553
That decision is made
with the people who love you.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.305
- May...
- And that's me.

19:40.805 --> 19:41.764
I love you.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.312
I thought that would shut you up.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.436
- You're not supposed to be here.
- I wanted you to know before her.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.819
It's all here.

20:37.779 --> 20:38.780
Are you ready?

20:39.572 --> 20:42.242
- She won't let me.
- Why?

20:42.909 --> 20:43.952
More tests.

20:44.452 --> 20:47.872
Creel betrayed us, but she'll still
listen to every word that he says.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.207
You said this was ours.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.417
You don't have to follow her
orders anymore.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.294
She locked me in here.
I don't have a choice.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.462
Of course, you do.

20:55.630 --> 20:57.548
You could tear her apart if you wanted to.

21:01.302 --> 21:02.303
So, why don't you?

21:06.474 --> 21:07.475
I don't know.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.525
The mechs are still sending signals
back and forth.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.735
- We should keep following it.
- And then sneak past them?

21:18.736 --> 21:20.029
Yeah, call that plan A.

21:20.571 --> 21:21.990
Plan A seems ambitious.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.325
Well...

21:25.660 --> 21:26.869
that's why we have a plan B.

21:37.922 --> 21:41.718
Yes, General, we have found the chamber.
We are looking it over as we speak.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.345
<i>We'll join you as soon
as Strucker finishes the plans.</i>

21:44.512 --> 21:46.055
<i>Keep it secure until then.</i>

21:46.514 --> 21:47.849
That will not be a problem...

21:48.433 --> 21:50.268
...so long as you keep your word.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.021
<i>You'll have your chance
with the chamber.</i>

21:53.896 --> 21:56.316
Another step toward becoming
the superior man.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.111
I hope it is as powerful
as you promised.

22:00.737 --> 22:01.821
<i>As do I.</i>

22:07.160 --> 22:08.161
<i>What was that?</i>

22:09.912 --> 22:11.289
Nothing I can't handle.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.593
What were those mechs guarding?

22:45.615 --> 22:47.408
This isn't connected to a water main.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.240
Just destroy all of it.

23:27.532 --> 23:28.950
Should've brought more explosives.

23:30.034 --> 23:32.870
Won't be long until they realise
we've slipped through their defences.

23:46.384 --> 23:48.970
We can cut out its heart once we work
out what this thing does...

23:50.179 --> 23:51.222
and to whom.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.687
Mr Ivanov,
you think he could be trusted?

23:58.312 --> 24:00.523
For the moment,
his interests align with mine.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.984
He wants to be first
into the chamber.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.404
I want to see what it does
to human flesh.

24:06.988 --> 24:09.115
- Would you like me to accompany you?
- No, I want you to stay focused

24:09.282 --> 24:10.616
on our contingency plan.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.785
You know the message
that needs to be sent.

24:13.411 --> 24:14.412
Of course, General.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.626
Ruby?

24:34.307 --> 24:36.100
You didn't think I'd still be here.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.812
I assumed Strucker opened the door.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.399
I'm surprised you're not with him
right now.

24:43.608 --> 24:44.650
Where would we go?

24:47.153 --> 24:49.322
It doesn't matter if there's a lock
on that door or not.

24:50.406 --> 24:51.532
I'd never run from you.

24:53.868 --> 24:56.245
- I've kept you safe.
- You've kept me obedient.

24:57.788 --> 24:59.207
And I've let you control me...

25:00.333 --> 25:02.001
and I have no idea why.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.377
Ruby...

25:04.378 --> 25:05.630
I have great plans for you.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.090
Like Whitehall had great plans
for you?

25:08.799 --> 25:10.510
You have always said
that you wanted a choice,

25:10.760 --> 25:12.470
but you've never given me one.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.724
I... I know that I've demanded
a lot from you recently...

25:16.891 --> 25:18.351
- No, Mum, you've demanded...
- ...but I...

25:18.518 --> 25:20.311
...the impossible and I have tried

25:20.561 --> 25:22.897
to be everything that you wanted
me to be.

25:23.064 --> 25:25.107
- I tried to eliminate weakness.
- I know. I know.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.692
I tried to be you!

25:27.276 --> 25:30.613
I've passed every test
and I've learned every lesson,

25:31.113 --> 25:33.407
- and I'm not enough.
- I never said that.

25:33.574 --> 25:34.700
I'm a disappointment.

25:35.618 --> 25:36.702
You said that, Mum.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.873
And after everything
that you've done to me,

25:41.332 --> 25:45.253
I've kept trying, because all I have
ever wanted to do is please you.

25:45.711 --> 25:46.712
Ruby...

25:49.590 --> 25:52.718
- You're my one weakness, Mum.
- Oh, Ruby.

26:03.437 --> 26:04.480
And I'm yours.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.238
- Ruby, stop.
- I'll make you proud.

26:23.541 --> 26:25.918
Get that ready for transport, now.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.217
- How'd it go?
- We're free and clear.

26:46.731 --> 26:47.732
Daisy.

26:48.816 --> 26:51.569
Hey, hey! Whoa, General.
It's okay. It's okay.

26:52.862 --> 26:54.071
Sorry. You startled me.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.202
It's bad enough I look like a...
bottle brush.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.747
Yeah, well, you probably can't...

27:03.205 --> 27:05.791
look at me without remembering
what happened.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.294
Not always in the driver seat.

27:10.755 --> 27:13.341
I know you didn't try and kill me.
I know that was a skin-job.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.594
Still, I'm... I'm really sorry.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.348
I should apologise to you.

27:21.557 --> 27:24.185
You came on a rescue mission
to try and save me. It went south.

27:24.602 --> 27:25.811
No, it's too high of a risk.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.605
- You should never have brought me here.
- It's...

27:28.105 --> 27:29.565
it's okay, General.

27:30.066 --> 27:33.736
Um. I brought you a change of clothes.
Is there anything else you need?

27:35.363 --> 27:36.405
Thank you.

27:41.077 --> 27:42.870
I'd like to talk to my wife.

27:43.746 --> 27:45.414
You know, just to tell her I'm safe.

27:45.873 --> 27:46.832
I'm sorry.

27:47.375 --> 27:48.751
Hale is still looking for us.

27:48.918 --> 27:51.212
We... We can't have any contact
with the outside world.

27:51.379 --> 27:53.255
- We have to stay dark.
- I said, "Cat".

27:53.506 --> 27:55.758
Cat! I scared George and...

27:56.884 --> 27:58.344
I need to talk to my son.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.805
I need him to know
I haven't forgotten him.

28:02.848 --> 28:06.811
I'm sure he knows how much you love him.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.858
I abandoned him, Agent Johnson!

28:14.318 --> 28:17.154
You don't get a second chance
to fix a screw-up like that.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.952
Maybe I can get word to them
through a secure channel.

28:26.956 --> 28:28.165
That's all I'm asking for.

28:33.087 --> 28:34.714
But that's not why you're here,
is it?

28:37.383 --> 28:38.926
We're trying to figure out
our next move.

28:41.095 --> 28:44.598
I need you to tell me what you can
about the site Hale kept you in, and...

28:46.767 --> 28:49.311
I need you to tell me everything
you told her about us.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.152
This could take a while.

29:01.323 --> 29:02.450
Well, that didn't take long.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.285
She won't work without
this component.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.245
And the machine does what,
exactly?

29:06.454 --> 29:08.414
It's an Adaptive Particle Processor.

29:08.664 --> 29:11.667
Scans an element at the atomic level
and then this component converts it

29:11.834 --> 29:13.294
to be merged with the recipient's DNA.

29:13.502 --> 29:14.503
We think it's the same technology

29:14.670 --> 29:17.423
that gave Carl Creel his powers.
Only his abilities are temporary

29:17.590 --> 29:18.924
and require physical touch.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.802
Yeah, but the machine's been upgraded,
so if Hale were to use gravitonium...

29:22.011 --> 29:22.928
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.389
- No gizmo, no apocalypse.
- But there's always a chance

29:25.556 --> 29:27.683
- that we've tried this before.
- More than a chance.

29:28.058 --> 29:31.562
Previous selves probably came here,
made all the same decisions.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.690
Still failed to change the timeline.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.026
You spoke to your older self
in the future.

29:37.234 --> 29:38.402
Did she give you any clues,

29:38.569 --> 29:40.905
any specific ways to stop this
all from happening again?

29:41.781 --> 29:42.907
We didn't have much time.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.788
I haven't told anyone this,
not even Mack...

29:49.580 --> 29:51.248
I didn't want to put this on the team.

29:53.751 --> 29:54.752
What?

29:57.129 --> 29:58.589
We have to let Coulson die.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.511
What? That doesn't make sense.

30:04.428 --> 30:05.971
The other me, she said...

30:07.181 --> 30:09.308
"Trying to save him
is what led to the end."

30:10.267 --> 30:11.268
But...

30:12.186 --> 30:13.771
how...

30:16.315 --> 30:20.152
- Time to improvise an exit strategy.
- You guys open one of the doors,

30:20.444 --> 30:23.572
whoosh, whoosh, I take their guns.
We shoot the robots, we go home.

30:24.281 --> 30:25.533
Sounds brilliant to me.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.871
Mack is going to be sad to miss this.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.462
Yo-Yo, Yo-Yo, what's going on?

30:48.305 --> 30:50.683
Is that furrowed brow
about our patient or about Yo-Yo?

30:51.725 --> 30:53.102
One minute, I'm...

30:54.436 --> 30:57.273
terrified for her and the next minute
I'm... furious with her.

31:01.235 --> 31:02.736
Elena's always been stubborn but...

31:03.821 --> 31:04.947
ever since her arms...

31:06.115 --> 31:08.826
- Yeah, well, if I hadn't let Hale...
- No, don't do that.

31:09.285 --> 31:11.203
- You made a mistake.
- Yeah, a big mistake.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.163
How do you even begin to make up
for something like that?

31:13.247 --> 31:14.707
Well...

31:14.957 --> 31:17.751
you fix something else.
That's why I like engines,

31:17.918 --> 31:19.461
putting the pieces together.

31:21.255 --> 31:23.382
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Piper, what do we do?

31:23.674 --> 31:25.676
Uh... We have to find
the source of the bleeding.

31:30.347 --> 31:33.017
All right, the bullet's in there.
Must've nicked an artery.

31:38.355 --> 31:40.357
- All right, step two.
- You have to clamp the artery

31:40.524 --> 31:41.901
before his blood pressure
drops any more.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.196
Did not think I'd be doing this today.

31:50.034 --> 31:52.161
Damn it, stay still!

31:52.703 --> 31:53.829
We're trying to help you.

32:04.048 --> 32:05.758
He's stabilised.

32:09.011 --> 32:10.054
That's step two?

32:10.387 --> 32:12.014
Yeah, well, we're gonna have
to wait to high-five.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.934
Step three is: you sew his artery
shut so he doesn't bleed out and die.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.857
- We need a new plan.
- What happened out there?

32:26.195 --> 32:28.364
I don't know. I was using my speed

32:28.530 --> 32:30.449
and it felt like my arms
were being ripped off.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.451
The mech arms aren't built
to go that fast.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.496
The interface is transmitting every
electrical signal simultaneously.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.289
It's overloading your nervous system.

32:38.415 --> 32:40.584
I don't need an explanation.
I need a solution!

32:43.963 --> 32:46.590
I can't recalibrate them, not here,
not before that door gives in.

32:47.800 --> 32:48.801
Take cover there.

32:49.969 --> 32:53.055
Fitz and I will draw them away
from the exits, keep them occupied.

32:53.222 --> 32:56.100
You find a way out,
make it to the Quinjet, call for backup.

32:56.266 --> 32:57.267
I can fight.

32:57.476 --> 32:58.727
- I think one of you should...
- No.

32:59.561 --> 33:00.604
We have a rule.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.231
We never leave each other's side anymore.

33:27.464 --> 33:28.507
Duck!

33:31.176 --> 33:32.678
I'm sorry you never got
the honeymoon you dreamed of.

33:32.761 --> 33:36.390
Nonsense. I'm protecting England
from evil robots with the man I love.

33:54.742 --> 33:57.494
- Ah! It's jammed!
- Go back! Go back!

34:02.416 --> 34:05.085
- Running low.
- I don't know what we were thinking.

34:14.887 --> 34:15.888
There you are.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.731
Please tell me you still believe
time can't be changed.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.193
You want to debate that now?
Is it...

34:30.694 --> 34:31.737
Isn't that why we're here?

34:31.904 --> 34:34.156
No, Fitz, just tell me,
it's against the law of physics.

34:34.322 --> 34:35.407
I need that right now.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.576
The perception of time is an illusion.

34:37.784 --> 34:38.702
Last mag.

34:39.536 --> 34:41.038
According to Hermann Minkowski,

34:41.288 --> 34:42.998
- space-time...
- No, you know, I was wrong!

34:43.165 --> 34:44.875
It's not helping.

34:58.347 --> 34:59.389
I heard what happened to you.

35:01.642 --> 35:05.187
- Now you are also part machine.
- Not the part that matters.

35:11.401 --> 35:13.487
I no longer feel pain.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.407
Unlike you.

35:17.866 --> 35:20.327
I have died dozens of times,
but you...

35:21.245 --> 35:22.704
no second chances.

35:38.929 --> 35:40.013
Part machine.

36:02.578 --> 36:03.829
Who's superior now?

36:09.751 --> 36:11.003
He was controlling them.

36:26.226 --> 36:28.520
- Welcome back.
- You are on a lot of drugs,

36:28.770 --> 36:30.856
but hey, good news, you didn't die.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.691
Thank you.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.360
You guys saved me.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.237
Well, we're just glad
you pulled through.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.156
Is Daisy here?

36:39.698 --> 36:40.741
She's so pretty.

36:41.950 --> 36:43.911
- What now?
- I want to put my mouth

36:44.119 --> 36:46.330
on her mouth and move it around a lot.

36:46.663 --> 36:50.167
But I don't want to do that
unless she wants to, too,

36:50.250 --> 36:52.002
'cause that's what makes it nice.

36:52.252 --> 36:58.842
But I don't think she wants that,
'cause she does not like me one bit.

37:00.302 --> 37:03.138
I mean, she's... she's not my type,
but I... I get it.

37:03.555 --> 37:04.848
Okay, Spaceman,

37:05.015 --> 37:08.894
- maybe we should...
- Mack! Dude!

37:09.436 --> 37:13.440
You are so cool.
Do we know any handshakes?

37:15.817 --> 37:18.612
- I... I appreciate that, but...
- Should I shave my head?

37:19.196 --> 37:20.697
Yeah, no. I see no flaws in that plan.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.492
Maybe then Daisy would like me,
because she...

37:23.700 --> 37:26.536
she protected me. She's very smart.

37:26.787 --> 37:29.081
Okay. Would it hurt him
if I turn this up?

37:29.248 --> 37:30.666
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- Good.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.502
I also... Ooh. My brain is falling.

37:34.044 --> 37:36.838
Hey, something weird just happened.

37:38.257 --> 37:39.466
Nah, I wouldn't. No.

37:40.634 --> 37:42.844
Uh. Remember the signal transceivers
from the mechs?

37:43.220 --> 37:45.138
- Yeah.
- We got a ping.

37:45.722 --> 37:46.890
We're tracing it.

37:51.353 --> 37:53.647
They're not damaged.
They just went offline.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.440
Perhaps something Yo-Yo did?

37:56.149 --> 37:57.025
Yeah.

37:57.526 --> 38:00.028
Whatever it is, we're safe. For now.

38:00.404 --> 38:03.490
- Still can't believe we survived.
- Me neither.

38:04.574 --> 38:07.327
But you were so certain we'd be fine.
"Time is fixed," and all that.

38:08.662 --> 38:10.038
I started having my doubts.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.500
Maybe your hopeful nature
is rubbing off on me.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.298
Aw! How cute.

38:20.924 --> 38:24.720
Well, looks like you two
have made quite the mess.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.973
It's not the first time. They were
there when S.H.I.E.L.D. tortured me.

38:38.233 --> 38:42.821
No. They destroyed a component
for the infuser. It's useless.

38:43.030 --> 38:46.283
We can't transfer the gravitonium
until it's repaired.

38:49.411 --> 38:50.454
Fix it.

38:51.580 --> 38:52.622
Or bleed out.

38:53.415 --> 38:55.751
Fitz, we can't let it happen again.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.503
We don't have a choice.

39:02.674 --> 39:03.717
We never did.

39:22.444 --> 39:23.445
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.114
I thought you'd like to know
that we got a lead on Hale.

39:26.323 --> 39:29.368
- You really helped.
- I wouldn't go that far.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.457
I also thought about what you said,
about your son.

39:36.291 --> 39:38.293
And, um, if...

39:39.002 --> 39:41.338
if I would've known that my dad cared
growing up,

39:41.463 --> 39:42.964
it would've made a big difference.

39:46.718 --> 39:47.969
So, it took some doing...

39:48.512 --> 39:49.554
uh, but this...

39:50.222 --> 39:53.266
phone was set to bounce
through a dozen foreign relays.

39:53.433 --> 39:56.269
We only have one shot and even then,
just a few minutes., but you can...

39:57.312 --> 40:00.190
call them without Hale tracing us.

40:02.109 --> 40:03.110
Thank you.

40:15.414 --> 40:17.124
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, honey.

40:17.791 --> 40:19.751
- It's Glenn.
<i>- Oh, Glenn.</i>

40:20.669 --> 40:21.920
<i>I was so worried.</i>

40:23.046 --> 40:26.049
- I know. I'm... I'm so sorry.
<i>- Once the Air Force took you,</i>

40:26.341 --> 40:29.094
<i>I... I got a few progress reports,
but then you never called.</i>

40:29.428 --> 40:30.720
<i>- I thought I'd never see you again.</i>
- Honey,

40:30.887 --> 40:32.597
I'm sorry. I only have a few minutes.

40:33.306 --> 40:36.268
I just want you to tell George
that his dad's okay,

40:36.768 --> 40:38.311
and his father loves him very much.

40:39.729 --> 40:42.274
And I'm getting better.
I'm getting stronger and I'm...

40:43.608 --> 40:45.444
I'm not yelling...

40:46.653 --> 40:47.654
as much.

40:49.156 --> 40:50.449
<i>- Glenn?</i>
- Yeah?

40:51.074 --> 40:53.368
<i>The doctors said that you should
take a deep breath.</i>

40:54.494 --> 40:55.495
<i>Calm your mind.</i>

40:56.496 --> 40:57.622
<i>You know what is best.</i>

40:58.331 --> 41:01.084
What is best is you comply.

41:02.294 --> 41:05.547
Remember, your compliance
will be rewarded.

41:10.886 --> 41:11.887
Glenn...

41:13.138 --> 41:14.431
are you ready to comply?

41:17.893 --> 41:19.019
I'm happy to.
