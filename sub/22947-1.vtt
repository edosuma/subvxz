03:06.520 --> 03:09.182
Answer me, Lord

03:09.356 --> 03:11.597
Answer me, Lord

03:37.843 --> 03:39.754
- Wow.
- Sit down.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.512
Thanks.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.145
How was your night?

03:52.315 --> 03:54.431
Good. How was yours?

03:54.609 --> 03:56.691
Good.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.687
This is great.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.199
Your shift's at 8.30?

04:06.371 --> 04:08.987
- You're not eating?
- I already did.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.700
You OK?

04:16.798 --> 04:20.255
Are you going to go with me
to Cindy and Bill's this weekend?

04:20.427 --> 04:22.713
Sure. What time?

04:22.888 --> 04:24.799
For the baby shower?

04:24.973 --> 04:26.679
Right.

04:30.604 --> 04:34.267
I don't want to go.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.931
You don't?

04:36.109 --> 04:38.065
I want Cindy and Bill to come here.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.863
Cindy and Bill are welcome here
whenever they want.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.489
Henry.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.280
Don't you think it's time?

04:50.665 --> 04:52.747
You're talking about kids.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.829
Of course I am.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.628
- OK.
- "OK", you want kids?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.664
I love kids.

05:00.842 --> 05:04.801
Henry, do you still love me?

05:06.848 --> 05:08.839
Of course I do.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.383
Cos I know that you used to.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.023
What happened?

05:31.957 --> 05:34.073
Henry Torne.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.116
Eddie Vibes.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.659
So how you been?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.920
I'm OK. What's going on?

05:40.090 --> 05:42.706
Ah, we got a man down here.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.505
I was wondering
if we could come in for a second.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.013
Joe! Joe. Come on.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.725
Oh, oh, oh.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.603
- You feel really hot.
- I'm sorry.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.813
Come with me.
Just get right to the back.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.320
- Straight back to the kitchen.
- I'm sorry.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.948
- Goddamn sausages at Pinwheels.
- Yeah?

06:10.078 --> 06:13.195
So, er...
we're in a bit of a bind here, Henry.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.490
We got a big play-off game
in the next half-hour

06:16.668 --> 06:18.624
and buddy boy there's
our first baseman.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.707
But as you can see,
he's not exactly game-ready.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.877
So what do you say?

06:26.678 --> 06:29.294
Feel like playing a little ball?

06:29.472 --> 06:30.928
It's November.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.511
Yeah. They keep the field
in pretty good shape.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.725
Oh.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.478
Oh, God. OK. OK.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.770
So what do you say?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.523
Henry?

07:04.299 --> 07:05.880
So where's this game?

07:06.051 --> 07:09.635
Near Kaisertown,
about er... 15 minutes away.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.380
Appreciate you driving, Torne.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.014
Sure.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.891
Just pull over here.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.228
Stop and get some beer money
at the ATM.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.647
Good.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.280
So, er... hang tight.
We'll be right back.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.946
Keep the engine running, OK?

08:08.738 --> 08:12.105
- Le petit café, Frank.
- Merci, merci.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.819
- A bientôt, Pierre.
- A demain, Frank.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.215
Hey, you! Freeze!

08:35.974 --> 08:37.589
Freeze!

08:45.150 --> 08:47.482
We know this wasn't your deal, Torne.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.564
These people aren't your friends.
Why stick up for 'em?

08:51.656 --> 08:54.443
You got a wife, you got a job.
Don't you care?

08:58.121 --> 09:00.533
You're looking
at three to seven, Henry.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.749
All you gotta do is say something.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.335
The court sentences Henry Torne
to three years in prison

09:15.513 --> 09:19.677
for the crime of
Felony First-Degree Armed Robbery.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.199
Hey. Excuse me.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.283
I'm Max.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.372
- Henry.
- Henry, good.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.209
Um... what are you in for?

09:52.383 --> 09:55.295
- What?
- What are you in for?

09:55.470 --> 09:56.880
Bank robbery.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.922
Nice. Clean, simple. I like it.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.967
- I didn't do it.
- No, of course not.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.554
Mistaken identity.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.310
What are you in for?

10:06.481 --> 10:08.142
Life.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.645
Just...

10:17.158 --> 10:19.399
Put it anywhere. It doesn't matter.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.909
It's not like you got much choice.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.917
Come on, hurry up, it's breakfast.

10:34.092 --> 10:37.380
Come on.
Monday is wholewheat bun day.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.093
What are you thinking?

10:47.272 --> 10:50.435
- Nothing.
- You can't be thinking nothing.

10:50.608 --> 10:56.103
Let me guess. You're thinking,
"How in hell did I get here?"

10:56.281 --> 10:57.987
How do you think we all got here?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.568
I don't know.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.607
We committed crimes, Henry.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.493
But we committed to the wrong thing.

11:04.664 --> 11:08.407
See, that was a mistake.
We never fulfilled our potential.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.416
See this guy here in the middle?

11:11.296 --> 11:13.662
Don't stare at him.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.502
Name's Hector.
He wanted to be a doctor.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.917
Thanks.
And he could have been a good one.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.881
Well, good or bad, I don't know.

11:21.055 --> 11:25.173
But he chose not to fulfill
his potential. Now look at him.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.843
So I'm talking about bad choices.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.980
I recommend these potatoes.
They're really terrific.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.483
Give him a little extra,
please, Charlie. Thank you.

11:35.653 --> 11:40.864
See, the real crime
is not committing to your dream.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.446
What is yours, anyway?

11:43.620 --> 11:45.781
- My what?
- Your dream.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.330
Not sure I ever had one.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.037
Never had a dream?
I mean, what kinda life's that?

11:52.212 --> 11:54.669
I don't know. A pretty good one.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.375
Hm.

11:56.549 --> 12:01.669
I don't er... mean any offense, Henry,
but you're in jail.

12:03.014 --> 12:06.051
Are you going to eat
the rest of this wholewheat?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.217
- No.
- Thanks.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.812
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.483
How are you?

12:21.658 --> 12:23.694
I'm OK.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.654
How about you?

12:25.828 --> 12:27.693
I'm good.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.996
You look beautiful.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.410
Henry...

12:36.923 --> 12:39.505
..there's something
I have to talk to you about.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.212
OK.

12:45.515 --> 12:48.382
I fell in love.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.924
Oh.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.936
I just... I mean, it just happened.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.188
I'm really sorry.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.942
- It's all right.
- You're not mad?

13:02.532 --> 13:04.318
No.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.776
I want you to be happy.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.960
Hey, Max, when's your next review?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.674
November.

13:26.848 --> 13:29.339
Show us
what you did last time for the board.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.007
I'm working. Stop.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.642
- What? One time.
- Come on, show us.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.678
- Show us!
- Leave me alone, OK?

13:35.857 --> 13:38.189
- Just once, come on.
- Come on!

13:39.652 --> 13:42.735
Pain in the ass. All right.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.147
So last time, um... I'm sitting there,

13:46.326 --> 13:49.159
and um... the Head of the Board
comes and says,

13:49.329 --> 13:53.868
"OK, Max, what are you going to do
for us this time if we let you out?"

13:54.042 --> 13:56.533
I get the old twitch working,

13:56.711 --> 13:58.247
and I go...

13:59.839 --> 14:02.581
"Well, um...

14:02.759 --> 14:04.374
"I'm going to break into your house

14:04.552 --> 14:08.841
"and then I'll kill your dog
and set the house on fire.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.971
"Then I'll dance through your garden

14:11.142 --> 14:15.306
"naked like some
mad, crazed werewolf.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.562
"And I'll bite and I'll mangle

14:17.732 --> 14:21.600
"and I'll tear the tongue
out of everything that's breathing.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.861
"Then I'll hurl myself into the sky,

14:25.031 --> 14:28.148
"the ethereal sky, flaming,

14:28.326 --> 14:30.658
"like God's darkest angel.

14:30.828 --> 14:35.162
"And I'll explode
into a goddamn heavenly fireball.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.453
"Boom.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.620
"Boom! You guys wanna see this?

14:41.798 --> 14:44.915
"I can't wait. Boom."

14:46.719 --> 14:49.756
What? What?

14:49.931 --> 14:52.263
You scared the shit out of me,
I tell you.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.175
Well, believe me,
I ain't going anywhere, thank God.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.345
When's your review coming up?

14:58.523 --> 15:01.139
- Next month.
- You gonna twitch like your cellie?

15:01.901 --> 15:04.768
- Nope.
- You don't like it around here

15:04.946 --> 15:07.028
Everyone knows Henry's innocent

15:07.198 --> 15:11.066
Board doesn't like you denying it.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.735
- I didn't do the crime.
- But you got the time.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.655
So you might as well have done it.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.540
I kinda like that.
That's funny, know what I mean?

15:19.710 --> 15:23.919
If you did the time, you might as
well have done the crime. It's cute.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.416
You're cute too, kid.
Get up. You're finished.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.336
- Get out of here.
- Thanks, Max.

15:34.934 --> 15:39.428
You never did tell me
what your dream was, Max.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.596
What?

15:41.774 --> 15:43.310
You never told me your dream.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.560
- I'm living it.
- Really?

15:46.737 --> 15:50.525
Well, yeah.
I mean, it's easy, living in here.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.281
I got nothing to prove,

15:52.452 --> 15:54.693
all you really gotta do is show up

15:54.871 --> 15:56.236
and they even do that for you.

15:56.414 --> 16:00.202
So, er... it's nice. It's good, yeah.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.207
This place is horrible, Max.

16:02.378 --> 16:06.291
Well, that makes me wonder
why er... Why didn't you ever talk?

16:09.010 --> 16:11.626
- When?
- Back then. When you had the chance.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.795
I mean, why?

16:15.558 --> 16:17.799
I felt maybe this was my way out.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.935
Oh. Was it?

16:21.105 --> 16:22.470
Yeah.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.309
- Bullshit.
- What do you mean?

16:24.484 --> 16:28.102
I mean bullshit. Nothing's changed.

16:28.279 --> 16:31.237
I mean, whether you're
out there or you're here...

16:32.742 --> 16:35.700
..the truth is, Henry,
you're still the same guy.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.028
Sorry.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.841
Have you got everything, kid?

17:00.102 --> 17:05.017
Hey, Max, maybe you should
think about getting out of here.

17:07.068 --> 17:12.313
Listen. The only thing I ever missed
in 23 years is maybe a hot bath.

17:12.490 --> 17:16.699
To tell the truth, I don't think
that's worth walking out of here for.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.444
Torne, let's go.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.416
I hope I never see you again.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.166
Henry.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.453
Hey.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.497
Hey, Debbie, Henry's here.

18:56.552 --> 19:00.716
- Come in. Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.768
Don't mind me.
I'm just setting up for my meeting.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.393
Hey, you want a beer?

19:08.564 --> 19:11.806
- Sure.
- Honey, mind getting Henry a beer?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.115
Hi.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.196
Hi.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.494
I know.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.059
That's everything you wanted.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.603
Thanks.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.103
- Are you happy?
- I am.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.691
I'm glad.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.606
What are you gonna do now?

20:04.954 --> 20:07.616
Honey, they're starting to arrive.

20:07.790 --> 20:11.749
Maybe you'd be interested, Henry.
You could be a Jin Chi distributor.

20:11.919 --> 20:15.707
It's Korean kitchenware,
the future of food storage.

20:15.881 --> 20:19.840
Plus if you recruit distributors
you get paid even more.

20:22.179 --> 20:26.468
- You mean like a pyramid scheme?
- No. Not... No. Not...

20:26.642 --> 20:29.805
It's a multi-layered
marketing paradigm.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.221
Anyway, give it some thought.

20:34.817 --> 20:38.480
Listen, Henry, I just wanted
to say thank you, you know.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.360
For what?

20:40.531 --> 20:42.772
For not giving up my name.

20:42.950 --> 20:46.363
- I don't know your name.
- Sure you do. It's Joe.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.367
You're welcome, Joe.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.999
I'll see you, Deb.

21:20.112 --> 21:24.071
..with as much as three inches
in the Buffalo South towns,

21:24.241 --> 21:25.651
and it will be getting colder.

21:25.826 --> 21:29.068
You look at the extended outlook
and you see all these flakes,

21:29.246 --> 21:32.033
but they're only going to be
scattered light snow showers,

21:32.208 --> 21:34.415
so most of our accumulations
will be tonight

21:34.585 --> 21:36.997
and a little bit more tomorrow.

21:39.173 --> 21:44.258
Take a chance on life.
Take a chance on Buffalotto.

22:18.754 --> 22:22.167
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.878
Are you OK?

22:25.052 --> 22:28.544
Stan, I... I gotta call you back.
I just ran someone over. OK.

22:28.722 --> 22:32.556
You idiot! You weren't even
looking where you were going.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.466
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.727
- Is he OK? Is he all right?
- I think so.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.683
Don't get up. I'll call an ambulance.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.099
- No, don't. I'm OK.
- Hey, it's you.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.642
Yeah, me.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.106
You know what,
he walked out into the street.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.942
I saw it all. You were on your phone.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.232
- You weren't even paying attention.
- I was.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.196
- I know how to drive.
- You know what?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.531
Just park. I'll take him to the café.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.788
Where are you going?
Stay on the ground.

22:55.958 --> 22:58.165
There we go. There we go.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.836
So they let you out, huh?

23:03.007 --> 23:04.668
Yeah.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.586
Un verre d'eau, Pierre.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.632
Thanks.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.147
Did you call an ambulance?
It's OK. I really am fine.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.684
Fine for a guy who just got run over.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.568
Lucky, I guess.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.197
I think someone should look at you.

23:35.539 --> 23:39.123
Hello. Guy.
Do you wanna see someone?

23:39.293 --> 23:42.581
- You look familiar.
- What?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.291
Oh. Oh.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.330
- That.
- What?

23:46.508 --> 23:49.921
Take a chance on life.
Take a chance on Buffalotto.

23:50.095 --> 23:53.007
- Oh. That's you.
- Unfortunately, yeah.

23:53.182 --> 23:56.265
Er... I mean, look,
you seem to be OK, right?

23:56.435 --> 23:57.800
Yeah, I'm OK.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.094
Great. So I can go now, right?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.853
- Sure.
- OK, then.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.764
Goodbye.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.605
And, you know, be more careful.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.742
I told you I never wanted
to see that face again.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.161
So?

25:50.549 --> 25:52.164
I figured it out.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.298
- Figured what out?
- My dream.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.426
Oh, that's good. So what is it?

25:56.597 --> 25:58.303
The bank.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.931
- The bank is your dream?
- Yeah.

26:01.101 --> 26:04.468
- Um... what bank?
- The one I didn't rob.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.136
- That's your dream?
- Yeah.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.723
What kind of
cockamamie dream is that?

26:09.902 --> 26:13.269
I did the time,
I may as well have done the crime.

26:13.447 --> 26:15.938
Yeah. Time, crime, right.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.695
- So what do you say?
- About what?

26:19.870 --> 26:22.361
- Will you help me?
- Help you what?

26:28.003 --> 26:31.370
You came to jail to ask me
to help you rob a bank?

26:31.548 --> 26:33.038
Yeah.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.592
I missed you, Henry.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.970
You've got your review coming up.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.677
- Yeah, so?
- So you can get out of here.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.762
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.552
- It's not.
- It is.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.688
No, it is not.
This is my home, buddy.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.850
This is not a home, Max.
It's a prison.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.893
Call it what you like. I'm happy here.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.437
Max.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.156
You can't die in this place.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.283
I can die
pretty much wherever I want.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.195
I'm asking for your help.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.080
I need your help.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.541
- I got cards, kid.
- Max.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.797
Come on. Look, I've thought about...

28:07.769 --> 28:11.057
God knows, I love my country.
I love it deeply.

28:11.231 --> 28:14.689
I couldn't see out of the train window,
I was crying so much.

28:14.860 --> 28:19.069
But I must drink my coffee.

28:21.742 --> 28:24.028
Firs, coffee. Firs?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.693
Where's Firs?

28:25.871 --> 28:27.907
I'm sorry, Firs is sick today.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.696
- What?
- He's... He's sick.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.116
He's sick. You know it. Continue.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.626
Fine, I'll pretend Firs is here.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.754
Thank you, Firs, you dear old man.

28:37.925 --> 28:40.587
I'm so glad to find you still alive.

28:40.761 --> 28:43.719
I said I'm so glad
to find you still alive.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.550
He's a little deaf.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.173
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich

28:48.352 --> 28:51.936
says that I'm an upstart,
a money-grubber.

28:52.773 --> 28:56.391
He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care. A bit.

28:59.029 --> 29:02.317
I just want you to believe in me.
Like in the old days.

29:02.491 --> 29:06.575
I just want your wonderful tender
eyes to look on me like they used to.

29:06.745 --> 29:11.364
No, no, no, no, no.
Stop, stop. It just is bloody.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.998
No! Simone.

29:14.169 --> 29:18.663
It's too small. It's too safe.

29:18.840 --> 29:22.424
- Stop showing me that safe face.
- Good, I won't.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.461
No, I'm not talking about you.
You're doing the best you can.

29:25.639 --> 29:27.254
I'm talking to you.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.297
- What are you doing?
- Me?

29:29.476 --> 29:30.886
Yes.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.310
Well, I... I'm listening.

29:34.481 --> 29:38.599
Listening?
Well, it looks like you're...

29:40.028 --> 29:42.770
..hearing, and to hear is to be weak.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.779
To listen is to be strong.

29:44.950 --> 29:48.033
Why? Because to listen is an action.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.031
No. What... What is that?

29:54.209 --> 29:55.995
It's an action. I'm listening.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.918
I mean, is that what you want?
Is that what you mean?

30:03.093 --> 30:06.005
- No, Djula.
- Mm-hm. OK.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.170
Then what do you want?

30:08.348 --> 30:10.760
You're performing, you're performing.

30:10.934 --> 30:15.303
Nothing comes out.
You're just performing. Performing.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.970
Well, that's what I do, Darek.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.514
I'm an actress.

30:18.692 --> 30:21.684
You can call yourself
whatever you want,

30:21.862 --> 30:25.571
but so far
you haven't shown me anything real.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.106
You see, here on stage,

30:27.284 --> 30:32.028
every moment, every word,
every breath should be a risk.

30:32.205 --> 30:36.369
Where is your risk, Djula?

30:36.543 --> 30:38.204
I don't know, Darek. In your ass?

30:39.546 --> 30:43.414
Good! Finally she's listening! Hah!

30:43.592 --> 30:45.503
From the top, everybody.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.042
I'm going to grab some coffee.

30:47.220 --> 30:50.303
Well, you do that, Djula.
Go and grab a coffee.

30:50.474 --> 30:55.719
Let's all have coffee and think about
what we're willing to risk in life.

30:55.896 --> 30:59.104
What are you doing here?
You here to sue me?

30:59.274 --> 31:01.310
- No.
- Good.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.271
20 minutes. I don't care.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.811
- Is it always like that?
- What?

31:05.989 --> 31:07.604
- That.
- In rehearsal?

31:07.783 --> 31:10.024
- Yeah.
- It's a process.

31:13.163 --> 31:14.573
Looks complicated.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.158
Yeah, it is.

31:19.795 --> 31:22.377
- Madame Julie.
- Coffee, Pierre.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.512
You want one?

31:32.682 --> 31:34.343
- Sure.
- Deux.

31:34.518 --> 31:36.133
- Deux cafés.
- Oui.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.976
Thanks.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.353
You looked like you were listening.

31:44.528 --> 31:47.770
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:47.948 --> 31:49.358
Really?

31:49.533 --> 31:51.148
In a way.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.487
Yeah. Yeah, I wasn't.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.823
I wasn't. I was playing it safe.

32:03.046 --> 32:06.584
You know, "The Cherry Orchard"
was Chekhov's last play.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.919
He was dying when he wrote it.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.880
It's kind of perfect.

32:11.054 --> 32:14.137
- Why?
- Because it's my last play, too.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.263
Here in Buffalo.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.347
I'm leaving. Right after this.

32:24.818 --> 32:27.059
So who are you?

32:27.237 --> 32:29.102
You mean my name?

32:29.281 --> 32:31.397
OK.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.941
I'm Henry.

32:34.119 --> 32:39.785
Well, I wanna thank you
for not suing me, Henry.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.368
Au revoir, Madame Julie.

32:41.543 --> 32:42.999
Ciao, ciao.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.463
Mr. Saltzman, please tell the Board

32:56.641 --> 32:58.757
why you believe
we should grant you a parole.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.934
Come on, Mr. Saltzman.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.940
What have you got for us this time?

33:12.782 --> 33:14.318
Mr. Saltzman?

33:15.577 --> 33:17.408
Come on, Max.

33:27.631 --> 33:29.167
See you, George.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.299
- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.132
Um...

33:41.561 --> 33:42.971
..where is your car?

33:43.146 --> 33:44.932
I don't have a car.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.516
You don't have a car?

33:46.691 --> 33:48.181
I sold it.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.100
Well, what is the matter with you?

33:50.278 --> 33:52.564
You come to pick me up
and you don't have a car.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.775
That is not the way
you pick up a person!

33:54.950 --> 33:58.408
Yes, it is. I'm here.
I'm picking you up.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.486
Look, I really don't know about this.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.951
I think I'm making
a pretty big mistake.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.709
Look, Max,
the bus station's just a short walk.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.289
Bus station?

34:09.464 --> 34:11.375
Don't worry, Max.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.165
Carl? Hey, Dave8.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.753
Let me in, will you? Open up!

34:14.928 --> 34:16.884
Max, it's gonna be OK.

34:26.481 --> 34:29.097
Are you kidding me?
This is your plan?

34:29.275 --> 34:31.813
An old cartoon in a pissoir?

34:31.987 --> 34:34.774
- It's a start.
- No, this is 80 years ago.

34:36.116 --> 34:40.109
Wait. I tell you what we do.
We do it the old-fashioned way.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.027
- We go in with guns.
- No guns.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.241
- Why?
- Someone could get hurt.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.540
That's very sweet of you, Henry.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.876
Maybe the tunnel's still there, Max.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.628
Yes, I'm sure it is, right

34:52.799 --> 34:54.915
- Maybe it is.
- Maybe it is.

34:55.092 --> 34:58.836
But maybe it's not.
I tell you what we do.

34:59.014 --> 35:02.802
First we go to this bank of yours
and see if that's there.

35:02.976 --> 35:04.341
It is.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.636
I'm sure it is. But maybe it's not.

35:17.657 --> 35:21.491
Now, which kind of account
would you like to open?

35:21.661 --> 35:24.403
Well, which kind have you got?

35:24.581 --> 35:26.947
Er... savings, interest-only,
commercial...

35:27.125 --> 35:28.740
Excuse me for interrupting.

35:28.918 --> 35:31.330
I was just thinking,
it's such a small world.

35:31.504 --> 35:36.999
My uncle... My uncle, he put all his
money in your vault when I was a kid.

35:37.177 --> 35:39.463
I mean, after we came from Europe.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.050
Before the War.

35:42.223 --> 35:45.215
The brownshirts and...

35:45.393 --> 35:47.554
Well, what was my point, anyway?

35:49.272 --> 35:52.935
I... Yes, and I remember him,
my uncle, telling me

35:53.109 --> 35:55.771
that your vault
would probably be here for 300 years.

35:55.945 --> 35:59.654
- Well, we hope he's right.
- The man was never wrong.

35:59.824 --> 36:03.066
Er...
how long has that vault been here?

36:03.244 --> 36:05.485
Er... since 1891.

36:05.664 --> 36:10.203
Wow. And I'm just assuming
it's in the same spot.

36:10.377 --> 36:12.333
Oh, yeah, yeah. Exact same spot.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.870
History, son. It's all about history.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.460
As I was saying,
we have savings, interest-only...

36:17.634 --> 36:21.627
Again, pardon me,
but you'll have to just give us

36:21.805 --> 36:25.047
a little time to decide
which of those we prefer.

36:25.225 --> 36:27.591
But I want to thank you so very much.

36:27.769 --> 36:31.227
- Oh, well, no, thank you.
- No, thank you for being so kind.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.061
OK, we'll get in touch with you.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.820
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.907
The vault is somewhere in here.

36:52.085 --> 36:54.701
The tunnel runs somewhere under here

36:54.879 --> 36:57.666
and ends up somewhere in there.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.296
It's virtually robbing itself,
isn't it?

37:03.888 --> 37:05.924
Goddamn Chekhov shit!

37:06.099 --> 37:08.590
Jesus. Henry?

37:08.768 --> 37:10.633
Hi.

37:10.812 --> 37:13.645
Julie, Max. Max, Julie.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.430
How do you do?

37:15.608 --> 37:17.815
- What are you doing here?
- Er...

37:17.986 --> 37:22.730
I was er... I was just showing Henry
the place where I used to perform.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.613
Oh. What?

37:24.784 --> 37:27.821
- That's lunch, Julie.
- Oh. Thank God.

37:27.996 --> 37:30.112
Yes,
Chekhov can be extremely difficult.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.451
It sometimes takes
a cast-iron stomach.

37:32.625 --> 37:35.241
- Why, you know Chekhov?
- Of course.

37:35.420 --> 37:39.163
Next to Gorbachev,
he's my favourite Russian.

37:39.340 --> 37:43.959
Excuse me, would you mind terribly
if I er... took a look inside?

37:44.137 --> 37:46.970
It's been maybe 30 years
since I've been in there.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.676
- Really?
- Yes.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.175
Well, er... yeah, sure.

37:52.353 --> 37:54.093
Very kind of you.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.143
How are you doing?

37:58.318 --> 38:00.058
Great I'm in hell.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.446
Home again.

38:12.957 --> 38:15.699
- What shows did you do?
- Ma'am?

38:15.877 --> 38:18.459
What productions were you in?

38:19.255 --> 38:20.711
Ah.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.838
Er... some of the greats.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.125
Er... Shakespeare, of course.

38:25.303 --> 38:29.296
Er... Ibsen, er... Yeats, Williams.

38:29.474 --> 38:32.136
Yeats. Yeats?
What play did Yeats write?

38:32.310 --> 38:35.552
No, it was about Yeats,
when he was a young man.

38:35.730 --> 38:40.440
Julie. Excuse me. Julie,
Mary wants to fit your wig at four

38:40.610 --> 38:43.477
and Darek says to stay hungry.

38:43.655 --> 38:46.522
- Fuck him.
- Got it.

38:46.699 --> 38:49.031
Um...
can I be a bit of a nuisance, please?

38:49.202 --> 38:52.239
I'd very much appreciate
a small tour around the old place,

38:52.413 --> 38:53.778
if you wouldn't mind.

38:53.957 --> 38:56.073
He used to perform here.

38:56.251 --> 38:59.493
- I suppose it's OK. We're on a break.
- Oh, thank you.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.457
- Henry?
- Sure. Go ahead.

39:01.631 --> 39:03.462
Julie, thanks so much.

39:08.221 --> 39:10.086
Is that your dad?

39:10.265 --> 39:14.474
- No, he's a friend.
- Really? Cos he seems like your dad.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.937
It's peaceful out here.

39:27.156 --> 39:30.694
Ah, the inner sanctum.
Like it was yesterday.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.234
Down here.

39:32.412 --> 39:34.448
People often make the mistake
of going down

39:34.622 --> 39:40.288
but in Chekhov,
you must always, always go up.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.995
- Bring back some memories?
- Oh, indeed.

39:46.509 --> 39:48.465
Let me tell you something.

39:48.636 --> 39:53.551
Did you know that there used to be
a speakeasy here during Prohibition?

39:53.725 --> 39:56.717
And they hid the booze in the bank.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.305
Exactly.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.970
Did you know there was a tunnel?
There was a tunnel.

40:01.149 --> 40:06.689
I know that. I know that.
As a matter of fact, that tunnel...

40:07.739 --> 40:09.604
That tunnel was um...

40:09.782 --> 40:11.864
I know where it is.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.616
- I'll show it to you.
- Really?

40:13.786 --> 40:15.617
- Mm-hm.
- Um...

40:15.788 --> 40:18.575
You did some acting yourself,
didn't you?

40:18.750 --> 40:20.661
I could tell.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.247
"The Cherry Orchard".

40:23.421 --> 40:25.582
So what's it about?

40:25.757 --> 40:31.047
A woman returns to her family estate
in the Russian countryside

40:31.220 --> 40:36.806
and she realizes that she has
to sell her beloved cherry orchard,

40:36.976 --> 40:39.718
which is
the magical place of her youth.

40:39.896 --> 40:42.512
It's the only place
she's ever felt safe.

40:43.483 --> 40:45.565
And it's about um...

40:46.694 --> 40:50.061
being forced to let go of the past

40:51.574 --> 40:56.193
and create a new life
in order to survive.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.240
We're going to have to be quick

41:02.418 --> 41:04.704
because Arnold hates
people in his dressing room.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.585
- Arnold?
- Oh, Lopakhin.

41:06.756 --> 41:08.121
Of course.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.960
Hello?

41:12.679 --> 41:15.136
And I think it was right here.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.548
Yeah.

41:19.936 --> 41:21.472
Huh. Amazing.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.520
Oh, boy. Lots of whisky.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.478
Filled with ladies and gentlemen.

41:29.696 --> 41:31.482
The good old days. Can you imagine?

41:31.656 --> 41:35.148
I think they sealed it up in 1931

41:35.326 --> 41:37.191
when they built the theater.

41:37.370 --> 41:38.860
Yeah, times have changed.

41:39.038 --> 41:44.658
Well, all good things
must come to an end, unfortunately.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.748
So what's your story, Henry?

41:47.922 --> 41:50.629
- My story?
- Like, what do you do?

41:50.800 --> 41:52.336
I'm figuring that out.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.876
Does that mean you don't have a job?

41:56.431 --> 41:58.387
I er...

41:58.558 --> 42:00.094
..just got out of prison.

42:00.268 --> 42:02.680
- Prison?
- It sounds worse than it is.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.812
Really? Cos prison sounds bad.

42:05.982 --> 42:09.224
Why were you there?
Are you a murderer or something?

42:09.402 --> 42:12.394
No. Do I look like one?

42:12.572 --> 42:15.063
- No.
- What do I look like?

42:15.241 --> 42:18.984
Oh, this place is
just full of treasures.

42:19.162 --> 42:21.744
Thank you so much.
It was great. Thank you.

42:23.249 --> 42:25.205
- And thank you, Simon.
- My pleasure.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.708
- And I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

42:27.879 --> 42:29.915
Max has offered
to volunteer at the theater.

42:30.089 --> 42:31.670
Oh.

42:31.841 --> 42:33.206
Work.

42:33.384 --> 42:37.502
Work. It's time to work,
you lazy Americans.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.635
Even you, Djula. Top of act two.

42:50.318 --> 42:51.899
What are you doing afterwards?

42:52.070 --> 42:53.526
- Why?
- You like Chinese?

42:53.696 --> 42:55.687
- Yeah.
- Jinlan?

42:55.865 --> 42:58.072
- Yeah, it's OK.
- Eight o'clock?

42:58.242 --> 43:00.198
Sure.

43:00.369 --> 43:02.405
- Great.
- Great.

43:02.580 --> 43:05.663
Djula, can we please start?

43:07.376 --> 43:08.832
Stay out of prison.

43:09.003 --> 43:11.369
- Djula, please.
- Yes, yes!

43:11.547 --> 43:13.253
- Can we start?
- I'm here!

43:13.424 --> 43:15.790
Good. You're coming in stage right.

43:17.178 --> 43:19.043
I can see it all, Henry.

43:19.222 --> 43:20.632
The bank,

43:22.016 --> 43:24.507
the vault, the theater, the tunnel.

43:25.937 --> 43:28.303
See,
we got all the pieces of the puzzle

43:28.481 --> 43:30.267
sitting right there on the table.

43:30.441 --> 43:33.808
Now all we gotta do
is put 'em in the right order.

43:33.986 --> 43:37.069
The only thing is the dirt.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.778
Where does the dirt
from the tunnel go?

43:40.952 --> 43:42.533
What about the vault?

43:42.703 --> 43:47.072
- I'm thinking dirt right now, Henry.
- OK.

43:51.671 --> 43:53.536
How do I look?

43:54.465 --> 43:57.582
- Huh?
- How do I look?

43:57.760 --> 43:59.751
You look like Henry.

44:04.392 --> 44:06.303
You gonna be all right?

44:06.477 --> 44:09.890
Yeah, we had a great day, kid.
Have yourself a nice dinner.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.466
Julie.

44:42.972 --> 44:45.634
Sorry I'm late.

44:46.976 --> 44:48.637
That guy's a total dick.

44:48.811 --> 44:50.176
Hi, Henry.

44:50.354 --> 44:53.061
Hi. So how was the rehearsal?

44:56.861 --> 44:58.817
I feel like duck.

45:01.824 --> 45:04.657
Yeah, I think I'm good.
The reviews are mostly good.

45:04.827 --> 45:10.697
But the problem is I don't just
wanna be good. I wanna be great.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.537
And I don't just
wanna be great in Buffalo.

45:15.421 --> 45:16.786
Where, then?

45:17.757 --> 45:19.372
Don't laugh.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.756
Hollywood.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.965
I guess that's where people go.

45:32.271 --> 45:34.011
Yeah.

45:35.483 --> 45:39.226
You know, I just don't want my legacy
to be a Buffalotto commercial.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.018
You know what? It's not going to be.

45:41.197 --> 45:43.654
Because the moment
this thing is done, I'm out of here.

45:43.824 --> 45:47.942
I'm just... I've gotta get out
before it's too late.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.574
Sounds like a plan.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.364
Yeah.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.253
I hate fortune cookies.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.679
I like 'em.

46:17.149 --> 46:20.186
Are we going anywhere in particular?

46:20.361 --> 46:21.976
Mm-hm.

46:24.824 --> 46:27.236
You want some?

46:27.410 --> 46:29.366
- No.
- No?

46:29.537 --> 46:33.530
Come on, take a chance.
Take a chance on life.

46:49.056 --> 46:53.595
There's a whole bunch of bodies
down there just churning around,

46:55.313 --> 46:57.269
caught in the current.

47:13.789 --> 47:16.576
So what did you do before jail,
Henry?

47:16.751 --> 47:18.707
I worked at a tollbooth.

47:18.878 --> 47:21.039
- Yeah? Which one?
- Eden.

47:21.213 --> 47:22.578
- No!
- Yes.

47:22.757 --> 47:25.499
Yay! I had family on the other side.

47:25.676 --> 47:29.544
We must have seen
each other 100 times.

47:29.722 --> 47:31.428
So, er... wow.

47:31.599 --> 47:34.557
You were one of those guys
in the tollbooth with the er...

47:34.727 --> 47:37.514
those weird... those rubber gloves.

47:37.688 --> 47:39.144
Yeah.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.815
What's so funny?

47:42.985 --> 47:44.725
It's just...

47:44.904 --> 47:47.361
You were watching everyone
go someplace

47:47.531 --> 47:50.694
and you were going nowhere.

47:50.868 --> 47:53.109
- That's funny?
- Yeah.

47:53.287 --> 47:54.993
It's funny-sad.

47:57.166 --> 48:00.203
So what did you go to jail for,
Henry?

48:00.378 --> 48:03.666
- Trying to rob Buffalo Savings Bank.
- What?

48:03.839 --> 48:09.084
I thought I was on my way
to a softball game but I... wasn't.

48:09.261 --> 48:12.219
- But now I'm gonna rob it for real.
- What?

48:12.390 --> 48:14.506
I'm going to rob it for real.

48:14.683 --> 48:17.595
You're going to rob the bank
that you went to jail for robbing?

48:17.770 --> 48:19.726
Yeah.

48:20.731 --> 48:22.596
- There's a tunnel.
- What tunnel?

48:22.775 --> 48:24.766
It runs from the bank to the theater.

48:24.944 --> 48:27.356
- My theater?
- Yeah.

48:32.952 --> 48:35.238
Fucking hilarious, Henry.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.536
You know what?

48:37.706 --> 48:39.947
- What?
- I'm hungry.

48:40.126 --> 48:42.082
- For what?
- Ice cream.

48:42.253 --> 48:43.868
Ice cream.

48:46.382 --> 48:48.464
Let's get some ice cream.

49:03.357 --> 49:05.313
I can't believe I'm sitting here.

49:05.484 --> 49:07.896
Neither can I.

49:08.070 --> 49:11.654
I want to dance and clap my hands.
I think I must be dreaming.

49:16.454 --> 49:19.742
You know,
"God knows, I love my country.

49:19.915 --> 49:21.280
"I love it deeply.

49:21.459 --> 49:24.246
"I couldn't see out of the train window,
I was crying so much."

49:26.046 --> 49:27.911
Page 21.

49:33.095 --> 49:36.963
Could you read Lopakhin?

49:37.141 --> 49:38.677
Sure.

49:43.564 --> 49:47.773
"I have to go to Kharkov on the
five o'clock train. Such a bother.

49:47.943 --> 49:49.604
"I wanted to stay and talk to you.

49:49.778 --> 49:52.645
"You're as wonderful as ever."

49:52.823 --> 49:54.563
Read the next line.

49:56.785 --> 49:58.195
"Even more beautiful,

49:58.370 --> 50:01.203
"and dressed like a Parisian...
You could blow me down."

50:02.583 --> 50:05.040
Um...

50:05.211 --> 50:07.167
could you say it like you feel it?

50:07.338 --> 50:08.703
Like it's real.

50:08.881 --> 50:10.997
Just say it to me.

50:12.384 --> 50:13.840
OK.

50:15.763 --> 50:17.719
"Even more beautiful.

50:17.890 --> 50:20.051
"And dressed like a Parisian...

50:22.102 --> 50:24.058
"You could blow me down."

50:29.109 --> 50:31.475
You're good. That's really good.

50:31.654 --> 50:36.739
You know what, I want you to keep
reading, but get up and walk around.

50:40.371 --> 50:43.158
- "Your brother Leonard..."
- Leonid.

50:43.332 --> 50:45.823
- Leonid.
- Leonid.

50:46.001 --> 50:49.585
"Your brother Leonid says
I'm an upstart. A money-grubber."

50:49.755 --> 50:52.041
Yes, you are, Henry.
You're a bank robber.

50:54.009 --> 50:56.751
"He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care a bit.

50:56.929 --> 50:59.636
"I just want you to believe in me
like in the old days."

50:59.807 --> 51:01.468
Again.

51:02.476 --> 51:04.091
"I just want you...

51:04.270 --> 51:07.307
"I just want you to believe in me
like in the old days.

51:07.481 --> 51:09.517
"I just want
your wonderful, tender eyes

51:09.692 --> 51:11.398
"to look at me like they did then."

51:11.569 --> 51:13.480
Say it without the book now.

51:21.328 --> 51:25.913
"I just want
your wonderful, tender eyes

51:26.083 --> 51:27.789
"to look at me

51:27.960 --> 51:30.793
"like they did then."

51:33.507 --> 51:36.044
Oh, I'm so glad I ran you over.

51:45.894 --> 51:47.509
Me too.

52:08.917 --> 52:10.748
Good morning.

52:11.962 --> 52:13.873
Good morning.

52:35.944 --> 52:37.434
Good morning.

52:49.500 --> 52:52.617
- Henry!
- Morning, Max.

52:52.795 --> 52:54.751
Hey, listen. I figured it out.

52:54.922 --> 52:58.756
The dirt from the tunnel
goes on the roof.

52:58.926 --> 53:01.838
Ah, company.

53:02.012 --> 53:06.005
- Good morning, Max.
- I'm sorry about the um...

53:06.183 --> 53:08.845
- It's all right. She knows.
- She does?

53:09.019 --> 53:13.228
I didn't know the dirt
from the tunnel goes on the roof.

53:13.649 --> 53:17.267
Don't worry.
I'm not going to tell anyone.

53:17.444 --> 53:19.730
Could I just have a second with you?

53:21.657 --> 53:23.363
Pardon us, will you?

53:27.705 --> 53:30.447
- What do you mean, you told her?
- I told her.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.580
- You told her everything?
- Yeah.

53:32.751 --> 53:36.084
Henry, it's a crime.
A crime's supposed to be secret.

53:36.255 --> 53:39.713
- It's OK, Max.
- No, it is not. It's not kosher.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.796
How do you like your bacon?

53:46.932 --> 53:48.468
Crispy.

53:52.438 --> 53:56.056
- What were you in prison for, Max?
- I was a confidence man.

53:56.233 --> 53:57.894
You mean a con man?

53:58.068 --> 54:00.605
I um... I don't like that word.

54:00.779 --> 54:03.316
Er, "confidence"
is a little more elegant.

54:03.490 --> 54:08.280
"Confidence" comes from the Greek
"fides", meaning faith and belief.

54:08.454 --> 54:10.410
Greek?

54:10.581 --> 54:12.412
I thought it was Latin.

54:12.583 --> 54:15.746
Well, yes, it is... it is now.

54:17.004 --> 54:24.046
So, essentially, you make people
feel good and then you rip 'em off?

54:24.219 --> 54:28.178
Yes. But I was always a little better
at the feeling good part

54:28.348 --> 54:31.306
than I was with the ripping off part,
hence jail.

54:35.105 --> 54:37.187
Aren't you worried
about getting caught?

54:37.357 --> 54:40.144
Well, it's kind of
a win-win situation for me.

54:40.319 --> 54:41.775
Why?

54:41.945 --> 54:44.027
I like jail.

54:44.198 --> 54:47.190
What about you, Henry?

54:47.367 --> 54:48.732
You like jail?

54:48.911 --> 54:50.572
No.

54:50.746 --> 54:52.486
I like it out here.

54:52.664 --> 54:54.575
So why would you take the risk?

54:55.918 --> 54:58.079
Or is it the money?

54:58.253 --> 55:00.414
Well, it must be the money.

55:02.633 --> 55:04.589
Boy, you are a criminal.

55:04.760 --> 55:06.921
You're a greedy little criminal.

55:07.095 --> 55:10.428
Your brother Leonid says
I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.

55:11.558 --> 55:13.139
But I don't care a bit.

55:13.310 --> 55:16.017
I just want you to believe in me
like in the old days.

55:16.188 --> 55:19.021
Cute! You remember. Good!

55:24.655 --> 55:26.111
Excuse me.

55:26.281 --> 55:27.771
- Excuse me.
- What?

55:27.950 --> 55:30.316
- Um... what exactly was that?
- It was Chekhov.

55:31.662 --> 55:33.027
Chekhov?

55:33.205 --> 55:36.322
- Oh, of course. Yeah.
- We read it last night.

55:36.500 --> 55:39.367
Yeah. He was so good.

55:39.545 --> 55:43.208
- You're really good. He's a natural.
- He is.

55:43.382 --> 55:46.624
Um... I thought you guys
were out on a date last night.

55:46.802 --> 55:48.212
We were.

55:48.387 --> 55:50.423
So now
going on a date is reading Chekhov?

55:50.597 --> 55:53.179
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

55:53.350 --> 55:56.057
I gotta get to the theater.

55:57.563 --> 56:00.270
Um... excuse me. Excuse me.

56:01.733 --> 56:04.475
Um... can you give me a ride
to the theater?

56:05.571 --> 56:07.027
Why?

56:07.197 --> 56:09.358
I'm a volunteer now.

56:13.161 --> 56:16.153
You were never in any of those plays,
were you?

56:16.331 --> 56:18.572
No.

56:18.750 --> 56:20.206
But can you give me a ride?

56:27.843 --> 56:32.086
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?

56:32.264 --> 56:35.552
We can't turn back the clock now,
poor dear.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.762
Crying, crying, crying.

56:37.936 --> 56:40.097
Oh, God. This is driving me crazy.

56:40.272 --> 56:42.888
- What?
- We could be digging right now.

56:43.066 --> 56:46.854
- We could?
- If we were in that dressing room.

56:47.029 --> 56:51.648
- It's rehearsal. There are people.
- Right. Just pissing me off.

56:51.825 --> 56:54.032
Well, what can we do, Max?

56:58.916 --> 57:00.781
What?

57:01.335 --> 57:03.417
- I got an idea.
- What?

57:03.587 --> 57:05.452
What if you played Lopakhin?

57:05.631 --> 57:08.338
- What?
- If you played Lopakhin,

57:08.508 --> 57:11.466
we could
get into that tunnel any time.

57:11.637 --> 57:14.344
They have a Lopakhin.

57:14.514 --> 57:17.005
- What if they didn't?
- What do you mean?

57:17.184 --> 57:21.598
What do I mean?
What if they didn't have a Lopakhin?

57:21.772 --> 57:24.388
I can't be Lopakhin.
I'm not an actor.

57:24.566 --> 57:27.148
You're not a bank robber
and you're doing that.

57:27.319 --> 57:28.684
Max, come on.

57:28.862 --> 57:31.979
- She said you were a natural.
- So?

57:32.157 --> 57:35.615
So a natural is a natural.
And a natural means you can do it.

57:35.786 --> 57:39.529
- It doesn't.
- You're gonna be Lopakhin.

57:39.706 --> 57:43.198
- There has to be another way.
- No. This is the way.

57:44.586 --> 57:47.623
- I don't know, Max.
- You want the bank, don't you?

57:47.798 --> 57:50.084
- Yeah, I do.
- Then you're gonna be Lopakhin.

57:50.258 --> 57:52.590
End of story. You're gonna be great.

57:52.761 --> 57:54.592
I swear to you.

57:54.763 --> 57:56.799
- It's crazy.
- You're gonna be great.

57:56.974 --> 57:58.510
I'll call you back.

57:58.684 --> 58:02.472
Darek, she's taking
a phone call in the middle...

58:02.646 --> 58:07.140
I did not take it.
It's exactly what I did not do.

58:10.195 --> 58:13.437
Listen, I was thinking here,
you could step backstage.

58:20.956 --> 58:24.198
- What's going on?
- You unprofessional...

58:24.376 --> 58:27.209
- Mr. Milodragovich.
- ..shit!

58:27.379 --> 58:28.744
Arnold's quitting.

58:28.922 --> 58:31.083
- What?
- He's quitting.

58:31.258 --> 58:34.091
We're talking about Willie Loman.

58:34.261 --> 58:37.549
The West End.
A Ken Waterstone production.

58:37.723 --> 58:40.260
Ooh, a Ken Waterstone production!

58:40.434 --> 58:41.890
The heavens have opened

58:42.060 --> 58:44.472
You're a lucky boy. Well, go, yes.

58:44.646 --> 58:47.854
Run, run to that
pampering, populist...

58:48.025 --> 58:49.390
Great

58:49.568 --> 58:56.406
..piece of shit Ken Waterstone
and his finest productions. Ha!

58:56.575 --> 58:59.408
Goodbye, Darek. I'm sorry.

58:59.578 --> 59:01.569
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

59:09.004 --> 59:11.040
We could have auditions
this afternoon.

59:11.214 --> 59:14.081
- I have a list of...
- That's a shit list!

59:14.259 --> 59:15.624
What do you want me to do?

59:15.802 --> 59:17.918
I can't hear you when you're yelling.

59:30.150 --> 59:31.981
What?

59:33.987 --> 59:36.273
No, no, no, sorry.
I can't give you a ride.

59:36.448 --> 59:38.905
I know, no. Before I start,

59:39.076 --> 59:42.989
I just want you to remember
that you said he'd be a natural.

59:45.832 --> 59:47.823
Stan, let me call you back.

59:49.044 --> 59:50.454
- What?
- Henry.

59:50.629 --> 59:52.460
- Henry what?
- He'd be perfect.

59:52.631 --> 59:54.371
Perfect for what?

59:54.549 --> 59:56.756
For Lopakhin.

59:56.927 --> 59:59.464
You mean
Henry should play Lopakhin?

59:59.638 --> 01:00:02.425
- Yes.
- What the fuck! He's not an actor!

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:05.636
Exactly. He's natural.
He'd just be playing himself.

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:09.019
Just give this a little thinkage.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.350
The man is Lopakhin.

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:14.187
I mean, he's a man
who's come from nothing,

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:18.229
he's a man who's not afraid to create
a new life, put his past behind him,

01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:20.613
and he's a man in love with you.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.991
Er... Madame Ravinsky.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:24.776
Ranevsky.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.491
- What did I say?
- Ravinsky.

01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:28.326
- I did?
- It's Ranevsky.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.910
That's weird. OK.

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:35.170
Can you maybe
get him in to see Darek?

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.920
What's going on here, Max? Hm?

01:00:39.094 --> 01:00:41.050
What's going on? What are you doing?

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:44.634
Listen. The truth is,
you need a Lopakhin

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:48.221
and Lopakhin needs a dressing room.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.136
You did this, didn't you?

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.611
OK, that... that's fair enough.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:09.363
OK. OK.

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:11.372
Confidence man.

01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:15.627
- Now, get out.
- I was just... I was getting out.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.920
Thanks.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.138
You have no training,

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:28.094
you've never been in a production.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:29.883
You don't even know the play.

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:32.222
I've read it.
I think I know this scene.

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:34.103
Oh, you think you know? What?

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:36.936
You're a peasant, a nobody.

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:47.109
Start.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:54.499
Your brother Leonid Andrevich
says I'm an ups...

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:59.789
How can you perform Chekhov
and not be able to say Andre-ye-vich?

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:02.252
- Say it.
- Andreyevich.

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:05.089
Good. Got the name right. Continue.

01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:09.427
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich
says I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:11.262
A what?

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:14.303
- A money-grubber.
- Really?

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:15.846
Are you?

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:17.434
- No.
- No?

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:20.316
- No!
- No? But convince her, not me.

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:24.320
Convince her!

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:29.697
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich
says I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:32.328
He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care a bit.

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:34.285
Neither do I.

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:37.625
I just want you to believe in me,

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:39.206
like in the old days.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:42.043
Now, do you, Djula?

01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:45.334
Show me. Tell me.

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:50.222
Yes, please can you show us
something we don't know?

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:53.975
Good God in heaven.

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:56.352
My father
was one of your father's serfs,

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:58.309
and your grandfather's serf
before that.

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.189
Boring!

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.442
It's all ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.978
It must come from here.
Speak with your heart.

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:07.989
She's your angel.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:10.696
Beg her. Beg her for forgiveness.

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:28.631
My father
was one of your father's serfs,

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.966
and your grandfather's serf
before that.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.264
But you, you did so much
for me in the old days.

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:40.271
I'd forgotten all that.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.061
I love you.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:48.150
Like a sister.

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:51.573
More than a sister.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.248
You piece of shit! Don't you ever...

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:10.552
Not bad, Djula. Give me a hug.

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:14.306
- No.
- Give me a hug.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:16.307
No.

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:17.843
Come here. Come on.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:19.682
I want to hold hands. Simone!

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:26.101
Argh!

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:58.679
Does this make me an accessory?

01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:02.345
I think so.

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:04.723
Depends.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.900
On what?

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.153
If I get caught.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:22.624
Things have certainly gotten
more interesting since you showed up.

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:28.709
You mean, since you ran me over.

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:38.840
It's not about the money, is it?

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:42.393
- No.
- Then why are you doing it?

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:48.649
I used to go along with everything.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.277
I didn't know I could change it.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.439
So now I'm changing it.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:56.449
And robbing a bank is changing it?

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.826
It already has.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:06.577
Can everybody gather round?
Darek wants to address the cast.

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:08.710
Thank you for coming, everybody.

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:12.215
I would like to introduce to you
Henry Smith.

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:16.674
From today, he's going
to do the part of Lopakhin.

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.839
If you please.

01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:22.350
Thanks. Thank you.
Looking forward to it.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.887
OK, let's take five minutes.
We'll go from the top of act three.

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:27.646
Top of act three, people.

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:52.873
Hold it.

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:26.781
Lower.

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.134
Henry.

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:44.882
That is a shit-pile of brick.

01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:48.553
Yeah.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.432
I think we might need
another pair of hands.

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:01.608
No! No!

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:03.151
No!

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:05.365
You've gotta be kidding!

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:10.660
You suck!

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:14.830
How could you possibly
suck any more?

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.417
Sucker.

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:19.337
I suppose that's him?

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:21.127
Yeah, that's him.

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:22.921
No, no, no.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.055
Thanks for meeting us.

01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:28.091
Sure.

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:31.600
How are you, Joe?

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.514
How's the business?

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:36.479
- You mean the pyramid scheme?
- Yeah.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:42.194
It all fell apart.
We were banking on that money, Henry.

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:45.826
And now all I got is a garage
full of dumb Korean plastic.

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:49.826
- Excuse me, um... what does that mean?
- Kitchenware.

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:53.538
You see what happens
when a person tries to go legit?

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:56.496
It's killing me.

01:08:56.674 --> 01:09:00.041
- It's gonna be OK.
- Really? It is?

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:03.756
You know how much diapers cost?
Huh?

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:07.094
You know how much it costs
to send a kid to college?

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:09.350
You're sending your baby to college?

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.479
No, of course not.
But the kid needs stuff.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:17.142
Stuff that's expensive.
Stuff he deserves.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:21.821
Joe, we might be able to help.

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:23.447
Yeah? How?

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:25.073
We might have a job for you.

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:27.868
No fooling.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:30.996
These things are hot.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.703
I'm on fire.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:40.715
So what do you think?

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:46.466
I think we should get some guns and
get the money through the front door.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.383
No guns. People could get hurt.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.767
- What about fake ones?
- They're still guns.

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:55.226
Joseph, we're not doing
one of those stupid robberies

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.313
with tellers and tears
and chump change.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:02.979
We're digging right through
to the belly of the beast.

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:05.068
Henry.

01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:07.825
Darek wants you on the stage.

01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:09.826
Now. Henry?

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:12.409
I hope we don't get caught.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.796
He's on his way.

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:26.552
Oh, thank you for joining us, Henry.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:29.135
I hope you're worth the wait.

01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:35.975
OK, er... places for
Lopakhin buys the orchard, all right?

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:38.060
Let's pick it up from there.

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:40.816
Places, please, for Lopahkin's speech.

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:37.933
What do you guys think?

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:42.564
- If it's a boy, do I cut him or not?
- If you mean his dick, yeah.

01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:44.598
You!

01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:52.690
First I see you guys in the bank,

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:57.654
then I see you guys
in the alley next to the bank,

01:12:57.832 --> 01:13:02.496
now I see you coming out
of the theater behind the bank.

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:05.161
I know what you're up to, gentlemen.

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:19.805
So what's on your mind, Frank?

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:25.022
Indigenous currency retrieval
and exchange.

01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:28.480
Once a month,
a truck goes to all our partner banks

01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:31.316
across the border to Canada,

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:34.698
takes up all the currency
and brings it back home.

01:13:34.869 --> 01:13:37.861
Let's say, on average,

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:41.497
eight to twelve million
held in our vault for a short time

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:44.204
before it's picked up
for redistribution.

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:50.214
Only a bunch of fools
would rob that bank any other time.

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:52.875
I could give you the dates.

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:57.297
I could help you with the alarms,
I could be your guy on the inside.

01:13:57.475 --> 01:14:00.308
Um... hypothetically,

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:03.595
let's just say you were right
about what we were doing,

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.809
which you're not, of course,

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:11.398
um... why would you help us
rob your own bank?

01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:16.657
- Got my reasons.
- This sounds like a set-up, man.

01:14:16.827 --> 01:14:21.036
I don't fuck around, kid.
Like I said, I got my reasons.

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:24.324
Well, you'll just
have to forgive us, Frank.

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:27.039
We have to hear 'em.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.674
Wife got sick a few years ago.

01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:36.802
Insurance wouldn't pick up
all the cost so I went to the bank.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.305
They wouldn't help
cover the difference.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:44.643
We were going to retire to France.
The Loire valley.

01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:49.815
We had to use all of our savings
to cover the bills.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:53.189
Spent everything we had.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.361
Then she died.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:06.624
I been 30 years at that place.

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:10.662
I'm sorry.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.126
November 23rd.

01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:17.801
The money's dropped off at eight
and picked up at midnight.

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:20.714
I retire in two weeks.

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:23.424
This is it.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.853
You set up that table,

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:30.060
I'll make sure dinner arrives hot.

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:39.240
Look,
why should I be ashamed to say it?

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:41.950
Oh. Why should...

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:46.201
Why should I be ashamed to say it?
I love him. I love him.

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:50.038
My love is like a stone round my neck

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:52.874
and it's dragging me down
to the bottom.

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:56.212
But... I love my stone.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.671
I... I can't live without it.

01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:01.337
For God's sake,
the man has robbed you!

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:03.346
Oh, no, no, no. Don't say that!

01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:05.929
He's a scoundrel.
Everybody sees it but you.

01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:07.934
A petty scoundrel. A user.

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:10.187
And you are what? 26 or what?

01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:14.225
Ah, please, please,
please, please, stop.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.689
No. Look.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.859
Djula, I can hear you
because you're acting very loudly.

01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:26.404
But I can't feel you.

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.910
Can I ask you a question?

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:36.252
- It is very personal.
- Mm-hm.

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.711
Have you ever been in love?

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:42.177
- Of course.
- Huh. Liar.

01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:43.838
Fuck you, Darek!

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:45.506
Then show us!

01:16:45.684 --> 01:16:47.515
Show us what love is all about.

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:50.393
How it rips you apart
and then puts you together.

01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:54.648
It carries you to the heavens
and then smashes you to the ground.

01:16:54.819 --> 01:16:57.356
Now, if you want
to become a great actress,

01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:00.237
then you
have to reveal something, Djula.

01:17:01.408 --> 01:17:03.865
What are you so afraid of, huh?

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:08.154
Maybe you want to die
old, alone, unemployed.

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:10.573
Is that what you want, hm?

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.158
Djula!

01:17:16.215 --> 01:17:18.001
Oh, that's right, Djula.

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:22.293
Run, Buffalotto. Run.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.007
You're very good at that.

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:25.842
Five minutes, people.

01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:27.381
Five minutes, everyone.

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:37.019
What?

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:44.444
Are you OK?

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.697
I... hate him.

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:53.495
I'm a good actress.
I am a damn good actress.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:57.833
What, I have to love someone
to be a great actress? Horse shit.

01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:04.669
I've heard it my whole goddamn life.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:07.429
- What?
- That I'm cold.

01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:15.971
No, you're not.

01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:25.488
Ice cold.

01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:33.952
Arctic cold.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:58.222
Mm.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.391
This is it. I got the place.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.434
South Beach, Florida.

01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:03.978
Incredible.

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:06.238
I'm talking palm trees,

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:09.696
all-you-can-eat sunshine,
nice sandy beach,

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:13.408
surrounded by grapefruits
the size of your head.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:16.540
Now, is that living it?
Is that living it? What?

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:20.373
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, that's living it.

01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:23.918
Who the hell's that?

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:27.335
- I'll check.
- Grapefruits, Henry, grapefruits.

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:30.713
Large, large grapefruits.

01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:34.509
- Who is it?
- It's me. Joe.

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:40.139
I'm sorry, Henry.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.780
The same bank.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:52.614
Shit, Henry. Now, that's poetry.

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.000
How you doin', Joe?

01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:03.913
Hello.

01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:05.831
Hello. Um...

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.672
Who's this guy?

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:11.712
I'm your new partner.

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:18.102
- Who's this guy?
- I know the whole story.

01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:22.811
Joe told me you guys need someone
to help get you into that vault.

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:25.397
And I don't dig. Dig?

01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:28.313
I'm sorry, Max.

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:33.026
Somebody tell me,
who the hell is this guy?

01:20:33.203 --> 01:20:35.990
I'm in... or you're out.

01:20:38.625 --> 01:20:41.082
Henry, how about a cold one, huh?

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:46.292
Let me explain something.

01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:49.880
This poor guy
doesn't know what he's talking about.

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:52.215
He's a drunk bum.

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:54.429
He makes mistakes.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.592
Drunken bums make mistakes.

01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:01.354
Now, you'll please
get the hell out of that chair.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:04.769
Henry and I go way back.

01:21:04.943 --> 01:21:07.901
We went to high school together,
right, Henry?

01:21:08.072 --> 01:21:11.439
- Yeah, I knew you.
- So just relax, old man.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:16.777
Max! Max, Max, it's OK. Max.

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:19.697
- I know him. I know him.
- All right. All right.

01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:29.752
I appreciate
you keeping your mouth shut, Henry.

01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:34.921
If there's one quality
I admire in a man, it's loyalty.

01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:40.009
What do you want, Eddie?

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:42.143
The American dream.

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:47.937
Deb says we can't have sex
till the baby is born.

01:21:48.112 --> 01:21:50.478
She says the kid'll know.

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:56.196
Get the fuck out of here, Joe.
Just shut up and go home, please.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:00.495
So, Henry, what about that beer?

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.127
Shit.

01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:12.666
Opening night.

01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:14.210
Shit, what?

01:22:14.388 --> 01:22:17.050
- Opening night.
- Yeah, so?

01:22:17.224 --> 01:22:18.589
It's soon.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.723
Correct. So let's go dig it.

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:23.055
I'm gonna have to leave her.

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:27.894
Of course you have to leave her.
You're robbing a bank.

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:29.604
Max, maybe we should wait.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.689
Wait for what? A bus?

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:34.446
What are you talking about?
It's a one-time deal.

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:36.356
The guy's retiring. We can't.

01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:38.275
What is the matter with you, anyway?

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.285
Come on.

01:22:56.805 --> 01:23:01.048
What?

01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:02.966
I can't do it.

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:05.978
- You can't do what?
- I can't leave her, Max.

01:23:06.148 --> 01:23:07.979
Leave who? Do what?

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:12.309
- I can't do this.
- Henry.

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:15.062
Henry, listen.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:19.574
You forced me out of jail to help you

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:22.111
and I'm gonna goddamn help you.

01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:28.827
See, I got through my whole life with
my mouth, you know, bullshitting.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:32.041
I've been nothing
but a fucking coward.

01:23:32.216 --> 01:23:35.583
But now I am going to do something.

01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:37.717
So here's the deal, Henry.

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:42.134
We're gonna dig this tunnel.

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:46.510
Then we're gonna rob the bank
and we're gonna take the money,

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:50.055
we're gonna put it in a car
and then we are going to drive away.

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:55.815
Do you understand, Henry?

01:23:57.199 --> 01:24:01.363
Yeah.

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:07.368
Henry to the stage, please.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:10.831
Henry to the stage.
Lopakhin to the stage.

01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:24.222
I'll be right out.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:30.892
Take a chance on life.

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:34.149
Take a chance on Buffalotto.

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:40.151
Oh, I hate this commercial.

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:43.817
- I like it.
- Why?

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:46.282
You're in it.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.292
Come on. I'm starving. Let's go.

01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:57.707
We have to do it opening night.

01:24:57.884 --> 01:25:00.876
- What?
- It's the only time we can get in.

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:06.757
- But that's in two days.
- Yeah.

01:25:09.813 --> 01:25:12.429
So you're leaving?

01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:15.728
Yeah.

01:25:15.902 --> 01:25:17.392
Wow.

01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:20.108
Oh, wow.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:22.068
Fuck.

01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:25.109
Fuck, Henry.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:32.708
- I was thinking we could meet.
- What?

01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:35.210
I was thinking California.

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:38.338
You were thinking
we could meet in California?

01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:40.214
Yeah.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:49.383
You know what?
You really are a thief, Henry.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:51.802
I mean, California?

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:56.644
Why would I go anywhere with you?
You can't cross a fucking street.

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:58.274
You wreck my play,

01:25:58.445 --> 01:26:00.276
you make me an accessory to a crime.

01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:02.779
I should call the cops
and you should go to hell.

01:26:02.949 --> 01:26:07.158
- I didn't know it would be this way.
- Henry, you're a bank robber.

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:09.991
You're a bank robber. Henry.
You're a bank robber.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:12.656
Th... I mean,
you knew that you had to leave?

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:15.701
- No.
- That's exactly what you wanted.

01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:20.873
- So that we could be together.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:36.309
You know what?
We screwed a couple of times.

01:26:36.483 --> 01:26:38.019
Right? So what?

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:43.028
- It was more than that.
- No, really, just a couple of times.

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:48.279
We both knew
this would never work out, right?

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:51.862
- I didn't.
- I did.

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:57.830
Go rob your bank.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:00.416
Go!

01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:35.205
You're a good man, Henry.

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:38.955
Yeah, Max.

01:27:58.732 --> 01:28:00.814
Enjoy the show.

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:05.022
Enjoy the show.

01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:09.322
Tonight, my dear players,

01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:13.236
we can show our audience
that the future is something

01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:16.496
we really need to fear.

01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:20.284
And to recognise that
knowledge itself is never more real

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:24.375
than in the beauty
of our imagination.

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:30.465
No, no, no.

01:28:31.348 --> 01:28:32.758
Shh, shh, shh.

01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:37.259
As we say in my home country,

01:28:37.437 --> 01:28:40.224
go out there and break some dicks.

01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:43.515
Off the cushion in the corner,
double into the center pocket.

01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:48.187
Ten minutes, people, ten minutes.

01:29:06.424 --> 01:29:08.289
Curtain.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:20.769
Thank God the train is in.

01:29:21.731 --> 01:29:25.519
- What time is it?
- Almost two.

01:29:25.694 --> 01:29:27.855
It's light already.

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:44.660
- How you doin', Frank?
- Doing good, Bernie.

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:55.049
Oh, my, the nursery!

01:29:57.058 --> 01:30:03.395
Oh, my dear, sweet,
beautiful nursery.

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.723
I used to sleep here
as a little girl.

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:09.939
Your train was two hours late.
How do you explain that?

01:30:10.113 --> 01:30:11.899
Is that good management?

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:14.689
I'm still like a little girl.

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:40.556
You ever think what you could do
with all that money, Frank?

01:30:40.727 --> 01:30:42.433
I know what you'd do.

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:45.061
You'd buy the Bills
and put them in first place.

01:30:45.231 --> 01:30:48.098
It'd take more money than that.

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:50.392
Hey, get in there, get in there.

01:31:02.082 --> 01:31:08.043
I guarantee it, I'd get 'em back into
the Super Bowl within two seasons.

01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:10.579
Perfect. Another chance to lose.

01:31:10.757 --> 01:31:15.342
Oh, my childhood,
my innocent childhood.

01:31:15.512 --> 01:31:17.878
I used to sleep in this nursery.

01:31:18.056 --> 01:31:20.342
I looked out from here
into the garden

01:31:20.517 --> 01:31:24.226
and I woke up happy every morning.

01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:26.387
Oh, my cherry orchard.

01:31:44.124 --> 01:31:46.536
Well, this is it, Frank.

01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:48.826
We got you something.

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:51.837
A little er... retirement gift.

01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:57.127
- Oh, thank you, guys.
- We wanted it to be from France.

01:31:57.804 --> 01:31:59.510
Where is he?

01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:01.888
Where is that old geezer?

01:32:03.393 --> 01:32:05.429
It stinks in here.

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:10.768
- Oh, break a leg.
- The play's already started, Max.

01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:14.059
Oh, right. Oh, Julie. Goodbye.

01:32:16.281 --> 01:32:18.442
Goodbye, confidence man.

01:32:22.328 --> 01:32:23.864
Go. Go! Go!

01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:26.200
Nice of you to join us, old man.

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:28.990
Just do your goddamn job.

01:32:34.174 --> 01:32:36.210
What? What now?

01:32:37.343 --> 01:32:39.959
Oh, no. No, no, not again.

01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:41.799
Jeez! Give me that.

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:43.929
- Sorry.
- Give me that. "Sorry"?

01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:46.056
You're a pussy, you know that, Joe?

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:49.094
You're a real pussy.
Get off the cord.

01:32:52.776 --> 01:32:55.438
What should we do?

01:32:55.612 --> 01:32:57.728
Tell us what to do.

01:32:57.906 --> 01:33:02.570
I tell you every day. Every day
I say the same thing over and over.

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:04.860
You must rent out the cherry orchard

01:33:05.038 --> 01:33:09.748
and the rest of the estate for
villas at once, right this second.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:13.331
The auction is coming up very soon.

01:33:13.505 --> 01:33:16.963
But it's all so vulgar.

01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:43.189
Aaaahhh!

01:33:51.751 --> 01:33:53.662
Welcome to my world, bitches.

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:07.672
Fuck, yeah.

01:34:19.612 --> 01:34:22.103
Is the cherry orchard sold?

01:34:22.282 --> 01:34:25.115
- Yes.
- Who bought it?

01:34:25.285 --> 01:34:28.152
I did.

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:30.411
I bought it.

01:34:34.085 --> 01:34:36.872
Wait a minute. Don't rush me.

01:34:37.046 --> 01:34:38.582
I'm all dizzy.

01:34:38.756 --> 01:34:40.838
I can't talk.

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:43.045
Oh.

01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:53.935
When we got to the auction,

01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:56.854
Deriganov was already there.

01:34:58.109 --> 01:35:01.818
He bid 30, I bid 40,
he bid 45, I bid 55.

01:35:01.988 --> 01:35:05.196
You see, he kept going up five
while I went up ten.

01:35:07.327 --> 01:35:10.034
Well, it didn't take very long.

01:35:10.205 --> 01:35:15.825
The gavel sounded
and now the cherry orchard is mine.

01:35:17.045 --> 01:35:18.626
Mine!

01:35:20.632 --> 01:35:23.419
God! God in heaven!

01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:27.423
The cherry orchard is mine!

01:35:31.142 --> 01:35:32.757
Tell me I'm drunk.

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:37.850
Tell me I'm out of my mind.

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:44.860
Tell me I'm dreaming.

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:56.497
- Is that it?
- Yes, it is.

01:35:58.044 --> 01:35:59.500
What's that, Eddie?

01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:04.506
It's a gun, Max. Joe, take the money
and put it in the car. Now.

01:36:04.676 --> 01:36:06.041
Joe.

01:36:06.219 --> 01:36:09.552
- Just stay where you are.
- Don't fuck with me, old man.

01:36:09.722 --> 01:36:12.555
You wanna shoot me?
You're gonna have to kill me.

01:36:12.725 --> 01:36:14.841
- No, no, no.
- Listen, stay out of this.

01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:18.227
What are you doin', Eddie?

01:36:19.357 --> 01:36:21.518
Welcome to the party, Brando.

01:36:22.902 --> 01:36:26.235
- What are you doin', Eddie?
- It's money, Henry, money.

01:36:26.406 --> 01:36:28.522
Come on, Eddie.
We're here, we're done.

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:32.784
Shut up, Joe.
Take the money out to the car now.

01:36:32.954 --> 01:36:35.445
Go on, move. Move.

01:36:36.207 --> 01:36:38.994
No happy ending for you, my friend.

01:36:39.836 --> 01:36:41.372
Agh! You animal!

01:36:41.879 --> 01:36:43.585
Aaargh!

01:36:43.756 --> 01:36:45.462
Aaarghhh!

01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:57.555
Max.

01:36:57.729 --> 01:36:59.560
Places, act four.

01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:01.892
Places, act four.

01:37:03.151 --> 01:37:04.812
Act four places, people.

01:37:05.611 --> 01:37:07.397
It's going very well, everyone.

01:37:07.572 --> 01:37:09.528
I gotta get on stage.

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:17.366
Son of a bitch.

01:37:21.336 --> 01:37:23.998
The peasants
have come to say goodbye.

01:37:24.172 --> 01:37:26.379
They're good fellows,
Yermolai Alekseyevich,

01:37:26.549 --> 01:37:28.380
but, in my opinion, a little stupid.

01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:32.339
You gave them everything
in your purse. Lyuba, that was wrong.

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:35.095
I couldn't help it.
I couldn't help it.

01:37:35.266 --> 01:37:39.100
Won't you please
come and drink a glass as a goodbye?

01:37:46.652 --> 01:37:48.643
Oh, man.

01:38:31.864 --> 01:38:34.150
Stop the car.

01:38:34.325 --> 01:38:36.316
Joe, stop the car.

01:38:36.494 --> 01:38:38.200
We can't stop the car, Henry.

01:38:38.371 --> 01:38:42.284
- It's the getaway car.
- Stop the fucking car, Joe.

01:38:42.458 --> 01:38:45.074
Stop the fucking car, Joe!

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:47.790
Stop the fucking car!

01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:52.040
What the hell are you doing?

01:38:52.218 --> 01:38:53.674
He's leaving.

01:38:53.845 --> 01:38:56.086
Leaving?

01:38:56.264 --> 01:39:00.553
Grapefruits as big as your head, Max.

01:39:00.726 --> 01:39:03.012
All-you-can-eat sunshine.

01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:07.685
OK, kid. I'll be seeing you.

01:39:08.734 --> 01:39:10.520
Yeah.

01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:13.144
I'll see you.

01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:19.992
What's going on?

01:39:20.163 --> 01:39:23.530
Just forget about it.
Let's get the hell out of here. Drive.

01:39:23.708 --> 01:39:25.369
Don't speed.

01:39:27.962 --> 01:39:32.080
Dear Mother used to love
to walk about in this room.

01:39:32.258 --> 01:39:34.670
My sister. My sister.

01:39:37.096 --> 01:39:39.758
- Mama!
- Ah-ooo!

01:39:40.725 --> 01:39:42.465
I'm coming.

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:08.665
Wait! Wait!

01:40:22.475 --> 01:40:24.056
I had to come back.

01:40:26.646 --> 01:40:29.012
I couldn't get on the train.

01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:31.306
The moment I stepped on the platform,

01:40:31.484 --> 01:40:34.476
the blood drained from my heart.

01:40:34.654 --> 01:40:38.146
I knew I would never see you again.

01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:43.901
What... is he doing?

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:46.241
I had to come back.

01:40:46.415 --> 01:40:49.953
Oh, come on, Henry.
What is this? What are you doing?

01:40:50.127 --> 01:40:53.085
This is the only way you'll listen.

01:40:57.677 --> 01:41:02.262
You should have gotten on that
stupid train. You made a mistake.

01:41:02.431 --> 01:41:06.549
The mistake would have been leaving
and not telling you how I feel.

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:11.266
Don't pretend you care!
All you care about is money!

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.647
- You think it's about money?
- Yes.

01:41:13.818 --> 01:41:19.108
- It's never been about money.
- My sister. Everything all right?

01:41:19.282 --> 01:41:21.898
- Get out!
- Don't you have a train to catch?

01:41:22.076 --> 01:41:24.112
Get out! Go away!

01:41:24.287 --> 01:41:27.905
Well, here he is,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:33.543
The selfish peasant who's taken
the orchard right out from under us,

01:41:33.713 --> 01:41:38.252
who's destroying it
right in front of our very eyes.

01:41:38.426 --> 01:41:44.092
Sometimes
you must destroy in order to create.

01:41:44.265 --> 01:41:46.631
We have to let go of our pasts
in order to live.

01:41:46.809 --> 01:41:49.471
You are no angel.
I see what you are by your actions.

01:41:49.645 --> 01:41:51.806
I came back, didn't I?

01:41:51.981 --> 01:41:54.222
I came back for you.

01:41:57.987 --> 01:41:59.818
Henry, just...

01:42:02.908 --> 01:42:04.569
..leave.

01:42:04.744 --> 01:42:06.985
Meet me in Moscow.

01:42:08.456 --> 01:42:11.289
Get off the fucking stage.

01:42:14.837 --> 01:42:18.455
What? What are you running from?
What are you afraid of?

01:42:18.633 --> 01:42:20.339
- I'm not afraid.
- Yes, you are.

01:42:20.509 --> 01:42:25.344
- Of what, Henry? Tell me.
- You're afraid...

01:42:25.514 --> 01:42:27.971
..because I love you.

01:42:32.021 --> 01:42:33.557
What?

01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:36.723
Meet me in Moscow.

01:42:36.901 --> 01:42:39.483
Tell me you'll meet me in Moscow.

01:42:39.654 --> 01:42:41.394
Go with him!

01:42:41.572 --> 01:42:43.654
Meet him in Moscow!

01:42:55.336 --> 01:42:59.796
- Meet me.
- Light... lights down ten.

01:42:59.965 --> 01:43:01.921
OK.

01:43:05.805 --> 01:43:07.386
Ten more.

01:43:17.775 --> 01:43:20.141
Ah, fuck, Henry.
