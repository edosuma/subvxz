01:28.792 --> 01:30.999
Seven rows rich, yes.

01:32.209 --> 01:34.249
Yes, a framework would be good.

01:34.875 --> 01:36.499
Double space also.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.791
No, please do not cross.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.708
Yes, one moment.

01:49.834 --> 01:52.249
We say goodbye to our son and classmates.

01:52.542 --> 01:57.583
A flower that should never have been planted, returns to the earth.

01:58.709 --> 02:00.249
Only five lines?

02:00.542 --> 02:02.124
Do not worry.

02:02.792 --> 02:05.791
Seven cost the same? Okay, then:

02:09.209 --> 02:10.874
Rest in peace,

02:11.792 --> 02:13.291
Blume.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.083
Yes, at the very end.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.583
Tomorrow would be great.

02:56.959 --> 03:01.166
Dear Mom, please do not forget to feed the fish. Mike

03:22.584 --> 03:23.791
Hello?

03:25.584 --> 03:27.999
Hello? Is there anyone?

03:29.709 --> 03:32.791
I can not see anything, it's so bright here.

03:35.167 --> 03:36.999
I'm Mike. Mike Tyson.

03:37.417 --> 03:40.083
Not the boxer course. Another.

03:40.834 --> 03:42.374
Logically.

04:03.875 --> 04:06.916
Statistically manages 99 out of 100 people,

04:07.250 --> 04:09.374
to kill by headshots.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.041
Just not one. This is me.

05:46.542 --> 05:51.041
We ask you, O Lord, Bill give the necessary strength and courage.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.124
We ask this in the name of Jesus.

05:55.709 --> 05:57.458
That's it.

06:00.042 --> 06:04.333
Excuse me, Mr ... - Pastor Harris. Or simply Harri.

06:04.625 --> 06:07.874
I have a question. - You're welcome. I am listening.

06:09.584 --> 06:11.083
It's about Jesus.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.416
Great! With pleasure.

06:16.167 --> 06:20.291
Jesus died on the cross, but then rose again.

06:20.709 --> 06:23.708
Correct. On the third day Jesus rose.

06:24.125 --> 06:29.124
Do you think this resurrection thing could also be happening to someone else?

06:30.209 --> 06:31.458
So no.

06:32.375 --> 06:34.958
No, the resurrection of Jesus is reserved.

06:35.584 --> 06:38.624
All others, like you and me, we just die,

06:39.042 --> 06:40.958
when God calls us to be.

06:41.750 --> 06:44.999
You mean, God decides when we die?

06:45.292 --> 06:46.292
Yes sure.

06:47.125 --> 06:49.291
Our fate is in God's hands.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.042
But hey,

06:51.834 --> 06:53.416
you are still young.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.374
Before you is a long life.

06:56.792 --> 06:57.792
Promised.

06:58.792 --> 06:59.792
So then...

07:01.334 --> 07:04.958
How can I guessed that my ex-husband leaves his gun at us!

07:05.250 --> 07:06.541
Good Morning.

07:06.834 --> 07:08.416
Oh, mein Gott.
- Hi, Mom.

07:08.834 --> 07:11.791
You look terrible. - Well, how are we doing?

07:12.125 --> 07:15.374
You know that you must not play with weapons!

07:16.084 --> 07:17.999
Even if it were only blank cartridges.

07:19.084 --> 07:21.874
You sit ... on the needle. - Oh. Sorry.

07:23.625 --> 07:25.999
The remains here among us, yes?

07:26.417 --> 07:30.583
Not that people think I had an arsenal in the garage.

07:30.875 --> 07:33.916
You know the talk ... - The women, yes!

07:34.209 --> 07:35.624
Sorry? - It is true.

07:35.917 --> 07:38.458
The king of Tratschs is a woman.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.666
I right or am I right?

07:42.959 --> 07:46.708
We have to go now. Help him, please get out of bed?

07:47.209 --> 07:50.958
He can not go home. We are still waiting for the findings.

07:51.375 --> 07:56.458
Oh no. He is not home but to school. Today is the first day of school.

07:57.334 --> 07:59.708
Get ready. I'll wait outside.

08:06.459 --> 08:10.374
I determined more reasons than you, me to shoot in the head.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.833
But I would ever do?

08:14.959 --> 08:15.959
No!

08:28.667 --> 08:31.416
The king of Tratschs is a woman?

08:32.625 --> 08:37.207
Unbelievable that this zero is a doctor. That is the king of the brain amputee!

08:37.750 --> 08:40.582
A shame that all idiots are sent to us.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.332
Down in the south would be the ...

08:43.625 --> 08:46.124
The sawmill. Half the city is working here.

08:46.417 --> 08:49.541
My mother also, as a secretary. Is your main job.

08:49.834 --> 08:53.541
She says if I were not, a job would be enough.

08:53.959 --> 08:56.124
But there must be other reasons.

08:56.417 --> 08:59.791
I have the time just so expensive I'm not.

09:00.084 --> 09:05.291
I do not play sports, do not have a driver's license and all my clothes are needed.

09:08.542 --> 09:09.916
FAINTVILLE Population: 2600

09:10.209 --> 09:12.624
2600 Inhabitants no longer true.

09:13.750 --> 09:16.791
After the mine closed up, many have gone.

09:17.209 --> 09:20.833
And who is gone, who comes not usually go.

09:33.167 --> 09:35.499
WELCOME BACK

09:41.000 --> 09:44.583
If anyone asks, you've hit your head, okay?

09:52.875 --> 09:55.166
Attention, Mike Tyson-alarm!

09:55.709 --> 09:59.124
Earlier I called Mike citizens. Citizens is the last name of my father.

09:59.417 --> 10:01.749
After the divorce, I got to my mother.

10:02.042 --> 10:03.249
A fighting starts, Mike?

10:03.917 --> 10:07.666
She did not know that I like a sandwich hot.

10:07.959 --> 10:09.624
Please do not bite!

10:09.917 --> 10:13.458
How to welcoming a crazy boxer, but is no better.

10:13.750 --> 10:18.291
Please do not rape, Mister Tyson. I am still so young!

10:21.000 --> 10:23.958
We say goodbye to our son and classmate ...

10:26.917 --> 10:27.917
Oh my God!

10:28.417 --> 10:29.791
Zombie-Alarm!

10:32.334 --> 10:35.458
"Bonjour la classe." Sit down now, please.

10:38.334 --> 10:43.666
As little surprise I brought you a new book.

10:44.084 --> 10:48.291
It says: "Le Morbel, c'est moi." The Morbel, that's me.

10:49.875 --> 10:53.083
It is about a boy named Morbel.

10:53.375 --> 10:55.291
He lives in an orphanage.

10:55.709 --> 10:57.499
The other children tease him,

10:57.792 --> 11:00.958
just because he is a little bit different.

11:03.834 --> 11:05.874
We read this book because of me.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.499
The teacher thinks I would not understand.

11:08.792 --> 11:10.833
But the savvy each.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.083
I thought you were dead! - No.

11:28.417 --> 11:31.083
It was in the paper! - Was a misprint.

11:31.542 --> 11:34.458
They should be more careful with these misprints.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.916
I'm scared half to death.

11:40.209 --> 11:43.249
I would 'can get a heart attack!

11:48.125 --> 11:51.499
A heart attack due to a fright is highly unlikely.

11:51.792 --> 11:55.833
The usual causes are hypertension, obesity and diabetes.

11:57.167 --> 12:00.874
Presumably, it is one of all three of these risk groups.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.458
Hey, Jesus,

12:24.959 --> 12:26.499
listen.

12:28.250 --> 12:32.541
So, since my life obviously is in the hands of your family,

12:32.917 --> 12:34.708
I have to ask you for help.

12:43.084 --> 12:45.041
I must strongly die.

12:46.292 --> 12:47.958
You understand that certain.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.541
I mean, not like you.

12:51.209 --> 12:54.333
Without resurrection, just dead, okay?

12:57.042 --> 12:58.416
All right,

12:59.250 --> 13:00.583
I count on you.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.916
Do you pray? - No.

13:03.334 --> 13:05.583
For what? - I do not pray.

13:05.875 --> 13:10.958
This is dangerous. Only praying people, and at the end they chase planes into skyscrapers.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.249
Is that clear to you?

13:14.167 --> 13:15.208
Then it's all right.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.916
If you need someone to talk to, come to me, yes?

13:26.292 --> 13:28.791
Do you really want no chocolate, Pastor?

13:29.084 --> 13:30.291
No. Thank Edith.

13:30.584 --> 13:33.874
God bless you. And enjoy your meal. See you.

13:34.667 --> 13:37.624
Good morning, Pastor Harris. Do you have a moment?

13:37.917 --> 13:40.624
For more questions about Jesus? - Actually already.

13:40.917 --> 13:44.416
Yes, once in the head, because you no longer get him out.

13:44.709 --> 13:46.374
As if you were in love!

13:46.667 --> 13:49.874
Do you think he will answer our prayers? - Yes sure.

13:50.167 --> 13:54.791
I am not baptized. Speaks the against me if I hand him something, please?

13:55.084 --> 13:58.124
Well, there is no guarantee, baptized or not.

13:58.417 --> 14:01.541
Jesus is indeed no dream machine. - Clear.

14:01.834 --> 14:04.999
It is important to have a clear goal. - I have that.

14:05.292 --> 14:09.749
If you think hard enough, then Jesus is the do likewise.

14:10.625 --> 14:12.624
Betty, which makes the new hip?

14:15.292 --> 14:17.916
And how's your mother? - Good.

14:18.209 --> 14:20.291
And where is she? - Work.

14:21.292 --> 14:22.624
Do we need it?

14:23.042 --> 14:25.916
No no. You're sixteen, right?

14:26.209 --> 14:28.208
Yes, you're sixteen.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.583
No, I do not need them. And you?

14:31.625 --> 14:33.416
Not necessarily. - Perfect.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.208
We clarify the man to man.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.708
Okay, I say it plainly,

14:43.542 --> 14:47.166
We have possible brain injury checked by your accident.

14:47.584 --> 14:50.583
We have discovered something unexpected.

14:51.584 --> 14:53.833
You have a tumor.

14:55.667 --> 14:56.791
In your head.

15:02.792 --> 15:04.916
He is about the same size

15:06.875 --> 15:09.374
and is located about here.

15:15.292 --> 15:17.541
You mean a real tumor?

15:18.209 --> 15:20.749
A brain tumor? - Just one.

15:21.042 --> 15:22.916
Will I die from it? - Well ...

15:23.417 --> 15:26.458
An OP can prevent worse.

15:28.042 --> 15:31.458
But that is not done here, but in burst.

15:33.667 --> 15:37.416
They have a whole team of specialists. So do not worry.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.374
I gave you an appointment for next week made

15:41.667 --> 15:44.083
for a preliminary investigation.

15:44.542 --> 15:47.874
Let's say I do not let me operate.

15:48.375 --> 15:49.708
I die then?

15:51.459 --> 15:53.874
A strange assumption, but yeah, possibly.

15:55.042 --> 15:57.333
Well, probably you would die.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.708
Wait, no, sorry.

16:00.667 --> 16:02.874
You would surely die. - How fast?

16:03.167 --> 16:05.833
Hard to say. These beasts are unpredictable.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.666
A few months, plus or minus.

16:09.792 --> 16:12.249
Either Jesus has just not much to do,

16:12.542 --> 16:15.166
or he's just goddamn fast.

17:30.375 --> 17:31.375
Danger,

17:31.792 --> 17:33.916
Mike-Tyson-Alarm!

18:41.250 --> 18:44.083
Whatever got into you, it is clear

18:44.917 --> 18:47.249
you have one of our best students

18:47.667 --> 18:51.249
and son of the parents' council chairman knocked out a tooth.

18:55.917 --> 19:00.208
These are children! Six years younger than you! You have to apologize.

19:00.959 --> 19:02.124
Five.

19:02.834 --> 19:05.083
Sorry? - The only five years younger.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.499
And they were three. - I do not care.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.708
We are a friendly school.

19:13.209 --> 19:15.416
Students here are nice to each other.

19:15.834 --> 19:18.791
And those who are not nice, we do not want here.

19:22.125 --> 19:23.791
Do you understand that?

19:24.584 --> 19:26.916
Very good. Will you apologize?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.208
It was not from the heart.

19:34.625 --> 19:37.333
All right. Go. Come on, get out of here!

20:26.375 --> 20:28.583
I am interested in coffins.

20:29.625 --> 20:32.083
I want to inform me of models and prices.

20:32.417 --> 20:35.666
May I ask why? A bereavement in the family?

20:35.959 --> 20:37.874
No, just because.

20:40.334 --> 20:42.624
Are you one of these Goths?

20:43.167 --> 20:45.583
No. I just want to be prepared.

20:48.084 --> 20:51.583
I can only welcome. Please, you just look around.

20:53.667 --> 20:58.458
You know, very few people take just any preparations.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.416
And guess who has to pay for the end.

21:03.292 --> 21:07.124
The verheulten survivors to move to a decision,

21:07.417 --> 21:09.208
is pure agony.

21:09.625 --> 21:13.291
This looks that I reap where I ask for simple things like ...

21:14.125 --> 21:15.999
the wood color!

21:16.500 --> 21:19.708
People die! That's not my fault.

21:20.584 --> 21:23.291
Which is your favorite? - That's easy.

21:24.125 --> 21:26.124
Der "Forever Eden".

21:26.792 --> 21:29.291
Walnut veneer, which handles 18 carat gold

21:30.209 --> 21:32.874
and interior finest Japanese silk.

21:36.459 --> 21:38.541
The course never buy anyone.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.249
The people are so stingy when it comes to dying.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.749
Which will buy it?

21:47.750 --> 21:50.124
Sad but true, that is all the rage here.

21:50.667 --> 21:52.541
99 toads.

21:56.375 --> 21:58.749
For the poor and unloved.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.624
Can I test it?

22:07.209 --> 22:08.416
For sure.

22:09.375 --> 22:10.791
Take your shoes off.

22:25.584 --> 22:27.208
Terrible, right?

22:27.709 --> 22:30.041
Worth hardly die for.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.333
You have to be Mike.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.041
Hi.

22:51.667 --> 22:54.458
I'm Steven. I'm here to help you.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.958
So you two actually.

22:58.209 --> 22:59.333
Na?

23:02.459 --> 23:03.499
All right.

23:06.209 --> 23:10.999
OK. The hospital management has informed us about your situation.

23:11.417 --> 23:14.791
Our situation? If you think that does not infringe privacy?

23:15.625 --> 23:19.624
Well, in certain cases we are informed ...

23:20.084 --> 23:21.541
As you now in, Mike.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.166
We have a number of ...

23:24.459 --> 23:28.041
"Incidents" in recent months found.

23:28.584 --> 23:30.624
Mike is 16. Because guys are just wild.

23:31.292 --> 23:35.374
Yes, that may be. Nevertheless, we are worried.

23:35.667 --> 23:39.749
In the last six months, your son had a broken rib,

23:40.167 --> 23:44.333
food poisoning, a torn ligament, two concussions

23:44.750 --> 23:46.458
and inflammation of the esophagus.

23:46.875 --> 23:48.291
So, there are wild

23:48.709 --> 23:50.416
and wild.

23:50.834 --> 23:54.374
You have children, right? Happily married, no children?

23:54.959 --> 23:58.041
In order to bring Mike back on the track, we suggest

23:59.042 --> 24:03.166
that you embark on a life-affirming treatment.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.291
My therapy?

24:05.584 --> 24:08.458
The important thing is not, as we call it, but where it leads.

24:09.417 --> 24:13.833
The recommended program we see conversations before with a psychologist,

24:14.167 --> 24:17.791
to exercises in order to develop a better body image.

24:18.334 --> 24:20.374
No need, I've got a super body sensation.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.291
Do you know what happens when doing the rounds?

24:23.709 --> 24:24.709
This is just between us.

24:25.167 --> 24:29.583
Thank you, but I was changed. No more accidents. Promised.

24:30.167 --> 24:32.333
Can you see it? No more accidents.

24:32.750 --> 24:34.999
The hospital will never see me again.

24:35.334 --> 24:37.416
The decision is not with me.

24:37.709 --> 24:40.041
This was ordered by the Youth Welfare Office.

24:40.459 --> 24:44.166
If you want your son lives on in your house,

24:44.584 --> 24:46.541
you must agree.

24:48.542 --> 24:50.208
Want to blackmail me?

24:54.042 --> 24:57.083
I point to only your options. - This is extortion.

24:57.500 --> 25:01.374
Do you think your shit Jugendamt can educate my son better?

25:01.792 --> 25:05.874
Do you believe in your hands Mike is a star pupil?

25:06.292 --> 25:08.041
So we can not talk further.

25:08.459 --> 25:10.499
Since voting I 'to, you fucking Snoop!

25:10.917 --> 25:12.208
Mom, I ...

25:12.625 --> 25:14.791
I'm so sorry. I do this program.

25:15.209 --> 25:17.166
That will be great.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.708
Your girlfriend Melody goes but also for therapy.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.333
Yes. But she's crazy.

25:22.625 --> 25:24.666
Melody Smith makes a therapy?

25:25.084 --> 25:26.749
For real? Wow...

25:27.959 --> 25:29.749
Do you know why?

26:40.709 --> 26:42.499
Can I have the butter?

26:42.792 --> 26:45.333
Take it yourself. - How was school?

26:45.625 --> 26:47.166
Is none of your business.

26:47.584 --> 26:50.083
War I was a bread? - You had enough.

26:50.500 --> 26:54.083
But I'm still hungry. - Want even fatter?

26:54.625 --> 26:58.499
No I do not want to. - Then stop finally eating.

26:58.792 --> 27:00.124
That's enough for now.

27:00.750 --> 27:04.416
Tell me what you think of this episode.

27:09.792 --> 27:14.291
I think the mother would calm can still have some bread.

27:14.792 --> 27:18.249
She was not as thick. - And compared to your home?

27:24.500 --> 27:26.208
With us there's no butter.

27:26.500 --> 27:30.374
Just try to keep the comparison somewhat more generally.

27:31.417 --> 27:32.417
Also,

27:32.625 --> 27:35.124
I live with my mother.

27:36.250 --> 27:39.208
I have no sister. And my father is gone.

27:39.875 --> 27:40.875
Na also.

27:41.709 --> 27:44.208
Tell me about your father.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.749
He is from Germany.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.208
This is in Europe, in England.

27:51.042 --> 27:53.583
I know Germany. - For real?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.333
How is it so?

27:56.625 --> 27:57.999
Klein.

27:58.417 --> 28:00.291
And full of Germans.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.958
Is there anything else?

28:03.625 --> 28:05.374
My father is an engineer.

28:05.667 --> 28:09.249
He helped build the bridge here. - Where is he now?

28:09.542 --> 28:11.624
I do not know. - Do not you want to know?

28:13.209 --> 28:16.666
Perhaps. - Then you should look for him.

28:22.667 --> 28:23.999
Maybe.

28:42.084 --> 28:44.708
No, this crap is carcinogenic.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.458
Do you think Frank still thinks about us?

28:47.750 --> 28:50.999
Why do you ask that? If the of the therapy?

28:52.000 --> 28:56.833
Tell better off nothing personal. You could use it against you.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.958
Do you think he still thinks about us? - I do not care.

29:01.459 --> 29:04.499
Do you know where he lives? - I want to go shopping in peace, right?

29:04.792 --> 29:06.749
Tell me, do you have his address?

29:07.042 --> 29:10.499
No, and I do not know where he lives. Satisfied?

29:10.792 --> 29:13.708
Forget it easy. He has also done with you.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.958
So life is. Some do not have a father, some.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.374
Excuse me.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.791
Did you see that woman?

29:31.250 --> 29:35.541
She has taken six Supersaver cereals. One can but only three per person.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.416
That's your mother. - So what?

29:38.709 --> 29:40.458
So what? - So what?

29:40.875 --> 29:43.208
You're really 'ne inclined family.

29:43.500 --> 29:44.666
Madness.

29:47.625 --> 29:49.791
COMMUNITY CENTER

30:13.042 --> 30:14.708
May I help you?

30:15.834 --> 30:17.458
Seeking a course.

30:17.750 --> 30:19.249
Den for new lease on life?

30:20.334 --> 30:21.666
How do you know?

30:22.084 --> 30:24.208
Only advised. Is there.

30:24.834 --> 30:27.958
But I'm here for 'nem other course here. Not dancing.

30:28.250 --> 30:30.916
What then? - Body movement.

30:32.625 --> 30:35.958
Dancing and body motion ... sounds somehow related.

30:37.709 --> 30:40.249
Anyway, there's only this course.

30:42.459 --> 30:47.083
So ... I'll be back next week. I forgot my gym clothes.

30:47.875 --> 30:50.749
Do not worry, we will find something for you.

31:18.667 --> 31:22.291
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

31:22.709 --> 31:24.416
Pivoting. Pivoting.

31:28.459 --> 31:29.541
Snake. Snake.

31:32.167 --> 31:34.916
To the right. To the left. And further.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.624
Is he dead?

32:17.250 --> 32:19.041
He's still breathing.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.624
Everything okay?

32:26.709 --> 32:28.416
Yes everything is okay.

32:32.417 --> 32:35.166
Very slowly. - We should call a doctor.

32:35.584 --> 32:37.624
Not necessary. Thank you. - Do you think!

32:37.917 --> 32:42.541
The same thing happened to the son of my cousin. Three days later he was dead.

32:43.209 --> 32:46.583
Exactly, that's what I mean. - I really do not need a doctor.

32:46.875 --> 32:50.083
Hi, we have an emergency in the sports hall.

32:50.500 --> 32:54.374
Please do not. - A young man fainted ...

32:56.042 --> 32:57.541
I'm sorry.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.999
But I lack nothing.

33:00.792 --> 33:02.541
Because otherwise...

33:03.292 --> 33:04.874
I can hardly this.

33:05.292 --> 33:06.292
Or that.

33:06.459 --> 33:10.083
Could I, if I need a doctor? Hardly likely.

33:23.417 --> 33:25.708
Bye, Miranda. - Until next week.

33:36.417 --> 33:38.458
Can I ask you something? - Clear.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.041
Can you lend me your car?

33:41.542 --> 33:42.791
For what?

33:43.750 --> 33:46.833
I must convey what, too big for my bike.

33:48.209 --> 33:51.916
What about your parents or friends? - It's been a surprise.

33:54.125 --> 33:56.999
Are you driving me home before? - I 'd like to do.

33:57.625 --> 33:59.833
But I can not drive.

34:00.167 --> 34:01.499
And who then moves?

34:02.750 --> 34:04.374
Maybe you.

34:04.750 --> 34:06.124
If yes your car.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.083
Hop in.

34:20.167 --> 34:23.708
That could be a good trick to tear girl.

34:26.167 --> 34:30.123
They are told, you need your car, but can not drive ...

34:31.083 --> 34:33.583
The boards I would leave. Too strenuous.

34:34.167 --> 34:36.333
Since there are girls not on it like that.

34:37.792 --> 34:42.291
But it could also be advantageous. Then a second girl needs help.

34:42.750 --> 34:45.791
So you can tear two at once.

34:48.125 --> 34:50.166
Are you a lesbian?

34:50.583 --> 34:51.583
Why?

34:51.833 --> 34:54.833
Because you over MÃ¤dchenaufreiÃŸen talk so much.

34:55.292 --> 34:58.708
No. I'm just trying to see things from your point of view.

34:59.375 --> 35:01.291
but I tear on any girl.

35:10.417 --> 35:13.249
Is what my face? - No, that's okay.

35:13.542 --> 35:15.499
But you have hair cut. - What?

35:15.917 --> 35:19.708
It is not so bad. Smaller presumably no.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.416
I just have a look for it. My mother is a hairdresser.

35:23.792 --> 35:28.124
Ah. Then you want me actually get only as a customer for your mother?

35:28.542 --> 35:31.708
No. Better go to Ramona. The cheaper.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.874
What you have there?

36:10.459 --> 36:13.541
Nothing. - Nothing but not crackling.

36:13.875 --> 36:15.749
If only one letter.

36:16.334 --> 36:18.041
By whom?

36:21.584 --> 36:25.249
No idea. Have not watched. - Then please peep now.

36:27.167 --> 36:29.999
Ah, from school. - What does it say?

36:31.584 --> 36:33.833
No idea. - Get him.

36:38.542 --> 36:40.916
The need your signature.

36:42.667 --> 36:47.249
In the next two weeks is not a school. - What? That will not do.

36:47.667 --> 36:49.791
You have to sign there ...

36:50.209 --> 36:53.041
Nothing there. Who will teach you? Me?

36:54.250 --> 36:55.749
Mike, please ...

36:56.917 --> 37:00.083
Hello? - Hello. Burst Hospital, Neurosurgery.

37:00.375 --> 37:02.624
Am I at the Tysons?

37:03.042 --> 37:05.708
No, wrong number. - You have been kicked out?

37:06.125 --> 37:08.208
Only for two weeks. - I beg your pardon?

37:08.625 --> 37:10.749
Is this about normal? What have you done?

37:11.167 --> 37:13.166
I had 'ne Brawl.

37:14.667 --> 37:17.124
Hello? - Burst Hospital again.

37:17.542 --> 37:19.291
Are you kidding me?

37:19.709 --> 37:21.624
Definitely not. Their son Mike ...

37:21.917 --> 37:24.874
Here is not a hospital. - No, you listen ...

37:26.084 --> 37:30.791
Listen, it is at 18 am, dinner time. And I eat my food prefer warm!

37:31.209 --> 37:34.458
So listen to kindly to harass us.

37:38.542 --> 37:40.749
I have two words for you:

37:41.875 --> 37:44.249
House arrest. - This is just one.

37:44.917 --> 37:47.999
House arrest is just a word, a double omen.

37:48.334 --> 37:49.749
I do not care.

37:50.042 --> 37:51.374
Just stay there.

38:40.042 --> 38:42.208
"Lieber Frank,

38:43.792 --> 38:45.249
I ... "

39:22.875 --> 39:24.041
Hi.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.291
Mike?

39:31.250 --> 39:32.374
And?

39:35.792 --> 39:37.749
Do you know who I am?

39:39.375 --> 39:41.333
Yes, you're Frank.

39:44.584 --> 39:47.166
Excuse me, but are you okay?

39:50.959 --> 39:53.833
I've got maybe misunderstood what ...

39:56.000 --> 39:57.999
It says you were dead.

39:59.167 --> 40:01.208
Oh, that was a misprint.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.749
A misprint.

40:05.250 --> 40:10.166
But is quite a long misprint. Have you sued the newspaper?

40:11.792 --> 40:13.749
But you should.

40:18.125 --> 40:19.999
Pretty crazy.

40:23.584 --> 40:25.916
Can I come perhaps?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.249
CLOSED DOOR

40:34.542 --> 40:36.333
It is finished.

41:03.292 --> 41:04.292
Mike,

41:04.709 --> 41:05.749
I'm back home.

41:11.584 --> 41:13.208
What shoud that?

41:13.500 --> 41:15.624
Cynthia, this is Frank.

41:16.375 --> 41:18.499
I know that Frank is.

41:20.125 --> 41:22.291
Why did you let him in?

41:24.959 --> 41:26.791
That you dare ...

41:29.334 --> 41:31.791
A friend sent me this.

41:34.334 --> 41:36.041
That is very interesting.

41:36.459 --> 41:39.333
Since your son has to die first, right?

41:39.625 --> 41:41.916
Yes. But there is no one died.

41:42.334 --> 41:45.499
So what's going on? - What's going on?

41:46.375 --> 41:48.583
It's Monday night, I come home from work

41:48.875 --> 41:51.208
and now cook something for me and my son.

41:51.500 --> 41:54.458
Someone 'ne false obituary has landed.

41:54.875 --> 41:57.958
As well someone wanted to muck the boy without a father.

41:59.584 --> 42:00.958
This is going on here!

42:01.250 --> 42:03.541
Was it you to herzulocken me?

42:04.750 --> 42:07.249
Do you still have them all? Come on, get out!

42:07.542 --> 42:08.542
No.

42:08.917 --> 42:10.249
First, we clarify that.

42:18.834 --> 42:19.834
Out.

42:20.084 --> 42:22.833
Put that gun away. - I'm serious. One...

42:23.250 --> 42:25.083
Mom, stop. - Two...

42:25.500 --> 42:27.374
Come on, not spinn rum.

42:27.792 --> 42:28.792
Three...

42:30.875 --> 42:34.249
Calm down. Well, I'm already. - Get lost. Out!

42:35.417 --> 42:38.166
I'm already gone. - Get out of my house.

42:45.334 --> 42:47.583
And take your shit gun.

42:48.084 --> 42:50.499
Do not you dare come here again.

42:52.584 --> 42:57.374
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this shit is your father.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.666
Are you back in Germany?

43:51.542 --> 43:54.083
No. I live in Nugget.

43:54.667 --> 43:55.874
Nugget?

43:58.334 --> 44:00.541
Am not come far.

44:29.292 --> 44:31.749
Sure that you're not dead.

44:51.375 --> 44:53.958
Do you have a new family? - No.

44:54.375 --> 44:56.249
No? - No.

44:57.500 --> 44:59.124
And why not?

45:01.459 --> 45:03.624
I'll probably only better understood.

45:05.792 --> 45:08.083
I just not a family type.

45:08.917 --> 45:10.374
Is that why you left?

45:12.042 --> 45:13.916
It's been a long history.

45:16.542 --> 45:18.458
Can I ask what you, too?

45:21.125 --> 45:23.333
What should this obituary?

45:26.667 --> 45:28.583
As I said, a misprint.

45:31.209 --> 45:35.166
You wanted a canoe buy and who understood you were dead?

45:43.542 --> 45:47.666
We must not talk about it. Let's talk about something else.

45:53.209 --> 45:54.624
Do you have a girlfriend?

45:56.667 --> 45:58.958
Have you ever thought of us? - When?

45:59.250 --> 46:00.250
Does not matter when.

46:01.084 --> 46:02.249
Clear.

46:02.667 --> 46:04.124
When exactly?

46:05.834 --> 46:08.083
Want to know every single time?

46:11.125 --> 46:13.124
That's strange. - I disagree.

46:13.417 --> 46:14.583
All right.

46:15.334 --> 46:16.916
Then not.

46:18.625 --> 46:23.999
Do you know when my birthday is? - Can we not talk normal us?

46:28.250 --> 46:29.999
In any case in winter.

46:32.917 --> 46:34.916
Thanks for the beer, Frank.

46:35.209 --> 46:38.958
You know the way out of town. Just about your stupid bridge.

47:01.042 --> 47:02.583
Beautiful place, right?

47:03.542 --> 47:05.624
Is unfortunately already taken.

47:05.917 --> 47:07.791
First come first serve.

47:08.209 --> 47:09.916
But no worry.

47:10.209 --> 47:13.291
If I know the preference of someone

47:13.834 --> 47:17.583
it is no problem to find the right terrain.

47:18.125 --> 47:20.374
The Small Town has its advantages.

47:24.750 --> 47:28.291
How are things going with you from? In the distant future, of course.

47:31.667 --> 47:36.666
Better a single grave or one with room for more people?

47:41.625 --> 47:43.208
This is an important decision.

47:43.625 --> 47:48.416
If you start with a single grave and then but the whole family is to

47:48.709 --> 47:50.416
then we have to...

47:51.084 --> 47:53.083
make a move.

47:53.500 --> 47:56.041
And that's really not a pleasure.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.291
Single grave.

48:02.417 --> 48:04.208
For sure? - Yes.

48:07.292 --> 48:10.208
You should really think twice.

48:10.500 --> 48:14.291
Although there is controversy in the family as long as we live,

48:14.584 --> 48:17.374
leads us to the death but always together.

48:18.084 --> 48:19.166
Believe me.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.291
Single grave.

48:59.125 --> 49:00.333
Mom?

49:01.625 --> 49:02.749
And?

49:04.459 --> 49:05.958
It's me.

49:08.250 --> 49:10.041
May I come in?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.124
And.

49:25.459 --> 49:26.583
Hi.

49:27.292 --> 49:29.249
And, did you find him?

49:29.834 --> 49:30.834
And.

49:31.500 --> 49:32.624
And?

49:36.500 --> 49:38.666
Did he tell you where he lives?

49:39.959 --> 49:41.083
In Nugget.

49:41.584 --> 49:42.584
Nugget?

49:43.542 --> 49:45.041
What an ass.

49:48.334 --> 49:50.208
Did he have other children?

49:51.792 --> 49:53.624
He says no.

49:53.959 --> 49:55.708
Hopefully true.

49:56.292 --> 50:00.249
Types like the should get festgetackert a condom on the tail.

50:02.709 --> 50:05.833
Was he nice when you meet him?

50:08.084 --> 50:09.499
Yes, he was.

50:09.792 --> 50:11.499
But who cares?

50:12.625 --> 50:13.874
Where is he now?

50:15.084 --> 50:17.333
Gone again. - What else.

50:17.792 --> 50:20.041
Strange that it came at all.

50:20.709 --> 50:23.416
Had not thought to see him again.

50:26.334 --> 50:27.791
Neither do I.

50:35.625 --> 50:37.749
Mike, darling, can you hear me?

50:38.209 --> 50:39.249
Mike!

50:39.584 --> 50:42.166
I'm busy. - Do it later!

50:46.459 --> 50:50.874
Well, that's not a surprise, Mikey toffee!

50:51.167 --> 50:53.791
And so cheerful! - Hello, Bernadette.

50:54.084 --> 50:57.833
Mike, this is Miranda. She's new in town and for the first time here.

50:58.250 --> 51:00.583
Miranda, this is my son, Mike.

51:00.875 --> 51:02.583
He helps out here because he ...

51:03.000 --> 51:04.333
helps out here.

51:04.625 --> 51:06.291
Would you be so kind?

51:06.792 --> 51:08.791
Mom, I've just done something.

51:09.125 --> 51:10.708
Homework? They can wait.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.041
I can wait. - No.

51:14.250 --> 51:15.458
Mike...

51:19.750 --> 51:21.833
You can put up here.

51:22.250 --> 51:26.458
New in town? Wow. I did not ever hear!

51:27.334 --> 51:31.166
Why Mike is not in school? Is he not as good?

51:31.459 --> 51:33.541
It was really not your week, what?

51:33.959 --> 51:38.916
It is this common string in the newspaper ... - Classes canceled. Unbelievable, right?

51:40.125 --> 51:42.999
Good, then let's go blow drying. Shoo, shoo.

51:48.334 --> 51:49.458
What are you doing here?

51:50.000 --> 51:52.708
cut my hair. - Why here?

51:53.000 --> 51:54.583
Ramona is on vacation.

51:56.084 --> 51:59.541
I can not believe that you still had this gun in the house.

51:59.834 --> 52:01.874
What Frank was thinking?

52:02.292 --> 52:05.083
Well, men and thinking which does not fit anyway.

52:10.959 --> 52:14.374
And the only reason why he has now in therapy?

52:14.792 --> 52:18.374
Unbelievable, right? Camilla has told me.

52:18.792 --> 52:20.916
This is not a therapy, only a sports course.

52:21.209 --> 52:23.583
Fantastic. Sport is good.

52:24.625 --> 52:26.541
Oh my goodness!

52:26.917 --> 52:31.208
I just noticed that you Frank look really similar.

52:32.167 --> 52:34.166
Bernadette, it's enough.

52:58.500 --> 53:00.999
To be with yourself in line is important,

53:01.292 --> 53:03.416
but also to harmonize with others.

53:03.709 --> 53:06.999
We now form pairs, I bring you waltz in.

53:07.375 --> 53:10.291
Find yourself a partner who is about the same.

53:16.042 --> 53:17.166
Mike.

53:18.167 --> 53:19.666
We are one too many.

53:21.042 --> 53:22.999
No problem. Teachers include.

53:49.875 --> 53:51.124
No matter what you do,

53:51.542 --> 53:52.708
see never down.

53:54.209 --> 53:56.833
The eyes are always directed to the partner.

53:57.667 --> 53:59.624
This is very important.

54:28.959 --> 54:29.959
Sorry.

54:43.792 --> 54:44.958
Hey.

54:45.959 --> 54:47.874
Why are you still here?

54:48.500 --> 54:50.666
How about 'nem restart?

55:29.000 --> 55:30.833
You're Mike, right?

55:31.625 --> 55:33.208
I'm Frank, your father.

55:35.292 --> 55:39.083
You do not remember probably, but I am glad to meet you.

55:40.375 --> 55:43.708
Do we want to do something about? It's going to be a nice day.

55:44.334 --> 55:45.334
What?

55:45.500 --> 55:48.916
I do not know what the other guys with their fathers?

55:49.875 --> 55:51.166
Fishing?

55:52.834 --> 55:54.624
Do not angle.

55:55.500 --> 55:56.916
What else?

55:57.209 --> 55:58.999
Go shooting.

55:59.292 --> 56:00.833
Wow, that we do.

56:02.667 --> 56:06.374
Come on, you're a man from the north. You have to learn how to shoot.

56:08.209 --> 56:09.958
Will be fun.

56:10.250 --> 56:11.458
Promised.

56:32.125 --> 56:34.499
Why the failure is still here?

56:35.125 --> 56:36.874
What does he want?

56:37.250 --> 56:39.249
I think he just wants to talk.

56:39.542 --> 56:40.542
Frank?

56:40.750 --> 56:41.833
Reason?

56:43.584 --> 56:44.749
About what?

56:45.792 --> 56:47.458
Nothing special.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.041
He wants to be just nice.

57:55.959 --> 57:57.083
Hello?

57:58.209 --> 58:00.374
Hi, Miranda, ich bin's, Mike.

58:01.875 --> 58:03.499
Ah, hi, Mike,

58:04.000 --> 58:06.333
I wanted you to call grad.

58:06.834 --> 58:07.916
For real?

58:08.625 --> 58:09.833
How so?

58:11.125 --> 58:13.291
I can not sleep.

58:14.417 --> 58:15.999
Why not?

58:17.209 --> 58:19.374
I think after about so much.

58:22.125 --> 58:23.916
This is stupid.

58:24.667 --> 58:27.874
Have you tried it with milk? Sometimes it helps.

58:29.209 --> 58:32.916
No, milk does not help. I've already tried.

58:35.334 --> 58:37.124
I'm sorry.

58:38.292 --> 58:40.541
Can I do something for you?

58:43.417 --> 58:45.249
I guess so.

58:47.125 --> 58:48.666
What?

58:50.292 --> 58:54.916
Can not you just stay on the phone until I fall asleep?

58:57.875 --> 58:59.083
Naturally.

59:00.042 --> 59:01.666
I can do that.

59:06.334 --> 59:09.458
Mike! It's four in the morning. Off to bed!

59:09.750 --> 59:11.374
Bloody hell.

59:14.917 --> 59:16.958
The plunger firmly against the shoulder.

59:17.250 --> 59:20.708
Holding right hand, otherwise it just blows you.

59:27.167 --> 59:29.416
Have you ever liked Cynthia?

59:30.709 --> 59:31.999
Na clear.

59:34.292 --> 59:35.791
I was crazy about her.

59:36.084 --> 59:37.291
For real?

59:40.000 --> 59:41.124
And.

59:42.459 --> 59:44.041
We had 'a good time.

59:48.459 --> 59:50.499
She's a great dancer.

59:52.167 --> 59:53.291
I did not know.

59:54.250 --> 59:55.374
No?

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.833
Since you have missed something. She is unbelievable.

01:00:06.209 --> 01:00:09.374
Unfortunately, every dance sometime an end.

01:00:14.084 --> 01:00:17.583
Cynthia refused to believe that. She wanted to work on ourselves.

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:20.624
But something is just not me.

01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:29.374
And then you're gone?

01:00:36.459 --> 01:00:39.249
I was a few weeks away,

01:00:39.542 --> 01:00:41.791
on 'its construction site in the south.

01:00:43.375 --> 01:00:45.999
On the day when I should come back,

01:00:46.959 --> 01:00:49.166
I realized that it is made of.

01:00:51.875 --> 01:00:53.791
Did not even call.

01:00:54.834 --> 01:00:56.458
Why not?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.833
Was just like that.

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:12.458
Do you want to try?

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.374
Take your time.

01:01:29.417 --> 01:01:31.124
You can also...

01:01:40.959 --> 01:01:42.499
Good shot.

01:01:47.375 --> 01:01:49.833
Hi. Guess what there is to eat.

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:52.249
Mom, I was just wondering if ...

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.874
Mike. That does not work like this.

01:01:55.625 --> 01:01:58.499
I know. We wanted to ask if it's okay.

01:01:58.792 --> 01:02:00.749
Mike said we could three ...

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.124
There is no "we three".

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:07.333
Frank is soon gone. Can not we eat one time together?

01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:10.041
Maybe he wants to apologize ... yes

01:02:10.334 --> 01:02:11.541
What? No.

01:02:11.959 --> 01:02:15.499
I'm here because you invited me, but I'm better.

01:02:15.792 --> 01:02:16.792
Good idea.

01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:19.541
Knocking off is the only thing he's good.

01:02:19.834 --> 01:02:24.374
Maybe this is also up to you. No one is so good at it to chase me.

01:02:24.709 --> 01:02:26.416
Do not hang me yes to, you ass!

01:02:26.834 --> 01:02:31.333
Stop it, that's 15 years ago. - Exactly 15 fucking years.

01:02:31.667 --> 01:02:35.291
Am I responsible for your life? - No Penny, no message ...

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:39.208
Ah, just like 15 years ago. The waste of time travel!

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:55.374
You have no idea who I am, what I'm doing ...

01:02:55.667 --> 01:02:57.041
Was?!

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.500
Hi.

01:03:06.667 --> 01:03:08.208
Selber hi, man.

01:03:14.709 --> 01:03:17.708
If you think it could not get any worse,

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.541
then this is often a mistake.

01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:24.666
Mike, open the door. - Are you serious?

01:03:24.959 --> 01:03:27.083
And if -. I do not let.

01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:29.541
Here is not about you. - Oh but!

01:03:29.834 --> 01:03:31.708
This boy is my life. - Oh yes?

01:03:32.334 --> 01:03:35.249
You do not get to, that he is sick? Are you blind?

01:03:35.667 --> 01:03:37.291
Mike, listen to time.

01:03:37.584 --> 01:03:41.999
wanting to die on a tumor is not wise. This is extremely painful.

01:03:42.417 --> 01:03:44.791
After surgery you can jump out of the window, yes.

01:03:45.209 --> 01:03:49.624
Come to Nugget. There's tall buildings. - That's not funny. My son wants to die.

01:03:49.917 --> 01:03:52.374
And so you have nothing to do?

01:03:52.709 --> 01:03:54.208
Oh, fuck you.

01:03:56.584 --> 01:03:59.166
Mike, be a man and Carry on. - Mike.

01:04:00.459 --> 01:04:02.374
Hey. Do you hear me?

01:04:03.584 --> 01:04:04.749
Go away.

01:04:05.167 --> 01:04:06.624
Go away.

01:04:09.667 --> 01:04:11.833
No, okay, okay.

01:04:23.542 --> 01:04:27.666
You do not have the right to decide about my life. It's mine.

01:04:51.834 --> 01:04:52.874
Mike?

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:56.249
Mike.

01:04:56.667 --> 01:04:58.541
Where are you going?

01:05:03.417 --> 01:05:06.708
Maybe you have it overlooked, but I've got a plate!

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.333
I mean, the car that you lend sometimes has.

01:05:10.625 --> 01:05:12.833
I'm in a hurry. - I do not care.

01:05:13.125 --> 01:05:15.124
I can not get on the screw.

01:05:15.417 --> 01:05:18.041
Please come and try it you times.

01:05:35.209 --> 01:05:37.208
Do you enjoy nature?

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:39.333
No.

01:05:40.209 --> 01:05:41.874
Bad mood?

01:05:49.959 --> 01:05:51.416
That's Jolly.

01:05:51.709 --> 01:05:54.874
You know, from: "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow".

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:04.916
Yes, I characteristic song. - Sure, what I thought.

01:06:06.167 --> 01:06:08.749
And, how's your wish?

01:06:09.042 --> 01:06:10.541
Pretty good.

01:06:10.917 --> 01:06:13.124
That's good news.

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:20.166
What's on your mind?

01:06:23.917 --> 01:06:27.458
If you firmly to what is believed, but suddenly has doubts.

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.208
What do you do there?

01:06:30.875 --> 01:06:34.416
to have doubts is normal. The we all.

01:06:34.959 --> 01:06:38.791
So we will put to the test. Whether we can resist them.

01:06:39.084 --> 01:06:42.708
Importantly: One must not be fooled.

01:06:43.167 --> 01:06:45.249
Belief in your own way.

01:06:45.709 --> 01:06:47.499
That is right!

01:06:48.834 --> 01:06:49.958
Thank you.

01:06:50.334 --> 01:06:52.041
That sounds logical.

01:06:52.417 --> 01:06:53.499
And.

01:06:54.459 --> 01:06:55.999
Come, Jolly.

01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:58.124
Come on.

01:07:05.042 --> 01:07:07.999
If I help you, you lend me again your auto

01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:13.249
With driver?

01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:22.666
Where are we driving to?

01:07:22.959 --> 01:07:24.083
Away.

01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:26.249
How far? - Far.

01:07:27.292 --> 01:07:28.458
Understand.

01:07:28.834 --> 01:07:30.958
I'm sorry, but this is an emergency.

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:32.583
Na clear.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.541
What kind of an emergency?

01:07:36.209 --> 01:07:39.958
You must not ask. This is against the rules.

01:07:40.334 --> 01:07:42.916
What are they? - No questions.

01:07:43.209 --> 01:07:44.541
Absolutely none?

01:07:47.209 --> 01:07:48.958
Sounds boring.

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:50.416
How so?

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.624
Without question you can not talk.

01:07:56.084 --> 01:07:58.374
Then we do not speak up.

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.208
Agreed.

01:09:03.375 --> 01:09:05.666
Are we far enough away?

01:09:09.542 --> 01:09:11.416
No, still looks the same.

01:09:12.459 --> 01:09:15.207
Is that the goal? That it looks different?

01:09:17.167 --> 01:09:19.874
I'm so sorry, but it will take forever.

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:24.832
Crap!

01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:40.916
Until.

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:43.749
And what now?

01:09:45.167 --> 01:09:48.207
We pull it to the side and call tomorrow to Ranger.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.582
But then there is the whole night alone here.

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:53.874
Dead is dead.

01:09:54.167 --> 01:09:55.291
No matter.

01:09:55.959 --> 01:09:57.958
It deserves something better.

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:13.083
I try times.

01:10:25.042 --> 01:10:27.374
Yes. Definitely a single grave.

01:10:28.042 --> 01:10:29.749
Perhaps it was married.

01:10:30.042 --> 01:10:31.624
Probably divorced.

01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:39.333
According to statistics, 50 percent of all marriages end in divorce.

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:56.083
Love deer,

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:59.333
Sorry, we have run over you.

01:10:59.625 --> 01:11:02.374
Please believe us, it was an accident.

01:11:04.292 --> 01:11:07.499
You ran like the wind in the heart a child

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.499
You beautiful animal, now may you rest in peace

01:11:17.917 --> 01:11:19.999
In heaven

01:11:20.959 --> 01:11:23.124
When it comes to merry

01:11:23.417 --> 01:11:27.374
Because there are deer and elk together in Nu

01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:35.374
Because thy hoofs of beavers are polished

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:39.708
And in the evening birch juice is served in glasses

01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:46.374
In heaven

01:11:47.042 --> 01:11:48.916
Talking birds with the deer

01:11:49.209 --> 01:11:52.624
Because there is not only to understand the deer

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:57.124
The animals play chess there, from morning to night

01:11:57.417 --> 01:12:02.374
But trust the bear not The Bumble where's just going

01:12:02.667 --> 01:12:05.458
Even in heaven

01:12:07.084 --> 01:12:09.291
Even in heaven

01:12:20.417 --> 01:12:22.041
Do you have what to eat?

01:12:22.459 --> 01:12:24.749
The have recently fallen from 'nem vices.

01:12:25.167 --> 01:12:26.749
What Hot perhaps?

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:29.458
Yes, I've citizens and Pizza.

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:32.249
The I can warm you.

01:12:32.542 --> 01:12:33.666
Super.

01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:43.624
Where are you going?

01:12:43.917 --> 01:12:45.249
We do not know yet.

01:12:45.542 --> 01:12:48.166
You are not from here, right?

01:12:49.709 --> 01:12:52.333
Why did so dirty hands?

01:12:55.334 --> 01:12:58.958
We work in 'ner nursery. - Is he not a minor?

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.874
Internship. - Middle of the night?

01:13:04.084 --> 01:13:07.166
We specialize in Solanaceae.

01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:12.708
All right. Because just now has a wife called.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.124
Has looked for her son. I thought that perhaps he.

01:13:22.542 --> 01:13:24.124
That can not be.

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:25.833
Well er East.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.708
Sadly, yes.

01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:31.916
Then he can not do his.

01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:34.458
No, he can not do his.

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:38.708
An orphan he has no mother who can call.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.583
The is already dead.

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:44.833
Since they can be bad calls.

01:13:47.625 --> 01:13:49.124
8,57.

01:13:51.917 --> 01:13:54.249
Maybe we should call your mother.

01:14:00.792 --> 01:14:01.958
Okay.

01:14:03.167 --> 01:14:05.666
What's up with your parents?

01:14:09.334 --> 01:14:11.291
If you think you have against the rule?

01:14:13.125 --> 01:14:15.458
Did not know that still applies.

01:14:20.334 --> 01:14:22.499
Then I'll tell you of my.

01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:25.374
They were terrible.

01:14:26.167 --> 01:14:28.291
Without wanting it.

01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:33.541
Mine are dictators.

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:36.041
What do dictators?

01:14:36.334 --> 01:14:37.791
They dictate.

01:14:38.917 --> 01:14:41.083
They interfere in your life.

01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:44.333
That's when parents like that.

01:14:45.292 --> 01:14:47.124
You call that love.

01:14:48.167 --> 01:14:50.583
I think the word does not fit.

01:14:55.292 --> 01:14:56.416
Walking ...

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.833
do you want to go now?

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.208
Yes. You must have now safely home.

01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:05.124
No, I have to sleep now.

01:15:06.417 --> 01:15:08.416
And where will you sleep?

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.583
For I,

01:15:12.292 --> 01:15:13.458
I thought,

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:15.749
we share your tent.

01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:19.916
Clear.

01:15:21.584 --> 01:15:23.416
You do not snore, right?

01:15:24.542 --> 01:15:26.999
I have a very light sleeper.

01:15:28.834 --> 01:15:30.124
Okay.

01:15:40.417 --> 01:15:41.958
Since the "H".

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:43.499
And...

01:15:43.792 --> 01:15:45.249
there is the "E".

01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:47.208
Just a little bit wrong.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.666
And...

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.958
because, in the bright star, there is the "L".

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.958
And just below is one more thing.

01:15:57.667 --> 01:16:00.416
And a piece about it is a small "O".

01:16:05.875 --> 01:16:07.791
Yes, now I see it also.

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:09.958
Not that "O".

01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:11.708
I read...

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.749
"Hell" as hell.

01:16:14.292 --> 01:16:16.999
Well, the sky just not greets everyone.

01:16:18.167 --> 01:16:20.249
Only those for whom it fits.

01:16:20.917 --> 01:16:23.083
And all the others,

01:16:23.834 --> 01:16:26.874
like that distract motorists until they run over deer,

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:30.374
the go to hell.

01:16:32.084 --> 01:16:36.583
And motorists who want to be dead deer by the roadside,

01:16:37.334 --> 01:16:39.166
what will become of them?

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.791
The still go to heaven.

01:16:44.584 --> 01:16:46.916
I know life is not fair.

01:16:55.292 --> 01:16:57.166
Miranda, are you sleeping?

01:17:00.334 --> 01:17:02.041
Miranda, are you sleeping?

01:17:06.292 --> 01:17:09.041
What would you say if I died?

01:17:09.417 --> 01:17:13.749
I would say: "Cool, now I have a sleeping bag for myself."

01:17:16.959 --> 01:17:19.166
And you, if I died?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.583
I do not know. Why should you die?

01:17:26.959 --> 01:17:30.624
I like you, Mike Tyson, but you have easy 'ne screw!

01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:32.041
Clear.

01:17:32.917 --> 01:17:34.374
That's why I'm in therapy.

01:17:34.667 --> 01:17:38.333
The let myself dancing in a circle, around them pure tap.

01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:40.458
Sounds almost magical.

01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:45.166
It is.

01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:04.041
If you switch to "D", it drives off.

01:18:04.375 --> 01:18:06.916
Brake left, right gas.

01:18:07.542 --> 01:18:09.583
And just like the waltz

01:18:10.084 --> 01:18:11.791
Never look at your feet.

01:18:12.084 --> 01:18:15.124
The eyes are always directed to the partner.

01:18:16.542 --> 01:18:18.374
In this case, the street.

01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:36.874
What do you think how easy it is?

01:18:37.375 --> 01:18:40.416
My loose screw? On a scale of one to ten?

01:18:41.834 --> 01:18:45.666
If it was a ten, because I can make more decisions?

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.749
Ten can not be.

01:18:48.417 --> 01:18:50.541
Then they would have long since fallen out.

01:18:53.167 --> 01:18:55.291
Perhaps it is the already.

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.666
And, you can taste the coconut?

01:19:27.584 --> 01:19:29.291
Let's go in.

01:19:32.417 --> 01:19:34.333
So I'm going to swim.

01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:37.583
And if this bothers you, then do not look, okay?

01:20:54.292 --> 01:20:56.374
Is nice here by the sea, right?

01:20:57.084 --> 01:20:58.166
And.

01:20:58.584 --> 01:21:01.541
Good thing there are not so many waves today.

01:22:11.792 --> 01:22:13.624
Come on, we have to leave.

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.500
Where?

01:22:16.875 --> 01:22:18.833
I'll tell you in the car.

01:22:21.084 --> 01:22:23.166
Who is first the car is allowed to drive.

01:22:26.084 --> 01:22:28.666
Always nice head high when walking.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.666
Miranda.

01:23:27.542 --> 01:23:28.833
Can you hear me?

01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:31.458
Can you tell me where it hurts?

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.208
Miranda, you have to wake up.

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:36.749
You have to wake up. Do you hear me?

01:23:51.584 --> 01:23:52.999
No.

01:23:54.459 --> 01:23:55.791
No no no.

01:23:56.292 --> 01:23:57.541
Not close your eyes.

01:23:58.334 --> 01:24:00.874
Do not close our eyes to. Let them in.

01:24:02.667 --> 01:24:04.999
No. You can not close your eyes.

01:24:05.292 --> 01:24:09.041
Please, stop your eyes open. You have to keep open them.

01:24:24.209 --> 01:24:26.083
You stay here.

01:24:55.792 --> 01:24:57.749
I'm so sorry.

01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:13.666
Hi, Mom.

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:17.249
I'm in the hospital.

01:29:25.334 --> 01:29:27.166
There's someone died.

01:29:27.917 --> 01:29:30.124
Someone I was very fond.

01:29:35.417 --> 01:29:36.583
Mom,

01:29:38.084 --> 01:29:40.208
I let me operate.

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:52.208
You can stop. Then I fall not in again.

01:31:25.459 --> 01:31:29.791
79 percent of students of my age do not like school.

01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:35.749
Since I know that, I'm going right back like.

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:39.916
I like it to belong to the statistical minority.

01:31:43.959 --> 01:31:45.291
Careful.

01:31:50.875 --> 01:31:52.583
Very carefully.

01:31:57.417 --> 01:31:58.708
Gut.

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.374
Then we drive.

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:09.708
Cynthia and I continue to make life difficult for us. At least most.

01:32:10.292 --> 01:32:12.999
But in between, there are good moments.

01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:31.416
Normally, I do not talk grave in this cemetery.

01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:35.249
But a special friend asked me.

01:32:35.542 --> 01:32:39.333
He was very convincing. I could not refuse.

01:32:40.417 --> 01:32:43.208
We say goodbye today by Miranda.

01:32:43.875 --> 01:32:46.791
May there be more people among us who help us

01:32:47.084 --> 01:32:50.208
if we go astray or are plagued by worry,

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:53.624
if we not trust us yet another,

01:32:54.459 --> 01:32:59.124
if we fear not to be loved, instead of giving love,

01:32:59.667 --> 01:33:02.749
if we believe the world would be there for us

01:33:03.042 --> 01:33:05.166
and not we for them.

01:33:06.417 --> 01:33:07.708
Amen.

01:33:48.209 --> 01:33:51.874
People say here, you are either fishermen or contactors.

01:33:52.209 --> 01:33:56.583
Apparently you do not have a choice, personality decides.

01:34:03.459 --> 01:34:06.458
TOT IS DEAD

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:18.499
You will perhaps not believe it, but ...

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.874
I wrote you a song.

01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:26.541
Be gracious with me, I'm still practicing.

01:34:37.375 --> 01:34:40.499
You're the girl who knows where to go.

01:34:40.792 --> 01:34:43.583
In 'ner scale of one to ten you are' ne 100th

01:34:43.875 --> 01:34:46.874
If I had a free wish,

01:34:47.167 --> 01:34:50.249
I would like to kiss you, kiss, kiss.

01:34:50.542 --> 01:34:53.333
But now you're gone,

01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:57.333
at a place where I do not belong.

01:34:57.625 --> 01:35:00.291
With marks your rosy cheeks,

01:35:00.584 --> 01:35:04.999
your serene lips and your beautiful green eyes.

01:35:07.959 --> 01:35:11.458
I'll never forget the time with you,

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:17.541
they will accompany me on my way.

01:35:20.125 --> 01:35:23.124
And if at some point I see you again,

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:26.416
I'll tell you how the world went down.

01:35:26.834 --> 01:35:30.416
Cause you're the girl who knows where to go.
