WEBVTT

00:39.456 --> 00:40.457
Fuck.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.464
- <i>Yes?</i>
- I'm Anna.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.760
The server for your party tonight.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.055
I'm the help.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.148
Happy New Year.

02:30.025 --> 02:35.322
<i>Anna, are you burdened by debt?</i>

02:40.619 --> 02:45.207
You're finally here.
I've been calling and calling the agency.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.292
- Annie, is it?
- Anna, yeah.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.753
Sorry, my bike's busted, so I had to walk.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.506
Put your stuff here.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.551
- I trust you brought something to wear?
- Yeah.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.637
Alpha, centennial playlist.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.732
We don't normally eat like this.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.068
Mind you, it's only because of
New Year's Eve.

03:13.068 --> 03:17.197
This food cost us six months of
our carbon credits, and we're not rich.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.200
You'll get a tip, of course.
Just don't expect it to be--

03:20.868 --> 03:22.411
It's going to be disappointing.

03:22.411 --> 03:25.956
What else? Champagne's there.
Hors d'oeuvres over there.

03:25.956 --> 03:29.209
And we'll get you out in time
for your own party, I promise.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.335
I don't have--

03:32.880 --> 03:33.881
Auggie?

03:43.140 --> 03:44.141
Tomorrow morning?

03:44.141 --> 03:46.268
<i>It's always better to start fresh.</i>

03:46.935 --> 03:50.939
- <i>To let you know, it will probably be on...</i>
- Auggie?

03:50.939 --> 03:52.983
- <i>Did you say something?</i>
- No. That's my wife.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.819
- August Bolo, where have you gone?
- <i>Does that mean you're reconsidering?</i>

03:55.819 --> 03:56.987
No, no.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.989
Our guests will be here any minute, dear.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.532
No second thoughts.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.868
<i>If you say so.</i>

04:02.868 --> 04:04.536
<i>I need a real commitment here.</i>

04:04.536 --> 04:06.163
- Auggie?
- I'll be ready.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.169
I've been searching all over for you.
Playing <i>Unicorn Capture</i> again?

04:12.169 --> 04:14.379
What? I don't even like that game anymore.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.468
What? A guy can't just sit
on the floor of his own closet?

04:20.385 --> 04:23.472
- I'm not playing anything.
- Yeah, this time.

04:26.517 --> 04:29.770
Imagine you spent our carbon
on something productive,

04:29.770 --> 04:33.106
- instead of your virtual pets or games.
- Or investments.

04:33.106 --> 04:37.694
500 shares in a company that
was going to invent self-walking socks.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.196
Those socks were a good idea.

04:39.196 --> 04:43.742
Sure, until the prototype
walked someone off a cliff. Oops.

04:43.742 --> 04:47.120
It was a bridge, and it was poorly marked,
and it was badly lit.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.749
Anyway, you're the one who's using
all of our carbon points

04:50.749 --> 04:52.334
for this little soiree tonight.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.711
Why are you so dressed up?

04:56.630 --> 05:00.843
It's New Year's Eve,
and you're sitting in a closet.

05:01.426 --> 05:07.891
At least I'm still trying to, for you,
for us, to make things festive.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.434
I'm festive.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.687
You are not festive.

05:12.938 --> 05:16.149
You think you know me.
You don't know what I--

05:18.151 --> 05:19.152
What?

05:21.071 --> 05:22.197
What don't I know?

05:24.157 --> 05:25.993
- What?
- Just saying.

05:27.995 --> 05:28.996
Forget it.

05:29.872 --> 05:30.873
They're here.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.461
And Auggie, put on some pants.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.680
You're here. You made it!

05:46.680 --> 05:48.640
- Hi.
- Eloise.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.517
- Elodie.
- Right.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.186
Was the last one an Eloise?

05:52.186 --> 05:53.353
Eleanor.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.565
Thank you so much for having us. This is--

05:56.565 --> 05:58.817
- We don't--
- Elodie is trying to bring back hugging.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.945
- It's so natural.
- Yeah. No, we don't touch.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.698
- Anybody?
- Anybody.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.534
Okay.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.078
- I love your dress. I love vintage.
- Thank you.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.413
Let me take your oxygen.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.748
- I have a girl here.
- Here you go.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.374
She's a bit of a mess. Excuse me.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.418
- Annie!
- Wow.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.337
- Can I get some help with these?
- Yes.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.049
- Thank you.
- Yes.

06:24.468 --> 06:27.137
What is that? Does she have that thing?

06:27.137 --> 06:28.472
The chip, yeah.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.891
Sweetie, didn't we talk about this?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.770
Your apartment just got 6,000 bangs.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.856
7,000, 12,000.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.233
Is that an ad? I hate that.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.401
Okay, drinks! Annie, please.

06:41.401 --> 06:46.031
It's micro-engineered grapes
from the last decarbonized bubble in Napa.

06:50.619 --> 06:51.745
Yum.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.580
What a treat.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.748
It tastes like armpits.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.333
I've heard that actually.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.211
That's the Napa terroir, darling.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.797
You've probably never had anything
to eat or drink

07:01.797 --> 07:03.549
that wasn't made out of kelp.

07:03.549 --> 07:06.635
No disrespect to the kelp farmers
in our midst.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.179
None taken. It's a good business.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.933
So, how did you two meet?
Did you know it was true love?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.059
We did.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.563
He was the most interesting man
I'd ever met.

07:17.563 --> 07:21.358
I always believed August
was destined for greatness.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.610
And she's been disappointed ever since.

07:25.737 --> 07:26.738
What do you do?

07:26.738 --> 07:28.824
- Well, first, he tried wind.
- I--

07:28.824 --> 07:31.660
Of course, there's no more wind.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.621
Then solar. Well, that went bust too.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.874
It's not my fault
that there's no more wind or sun.

07:36.874 --> 07:40.502
It's not my fault that we're drowning in
smoke and fog on this desiccated planet.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.588
It's not my fault, Sylvie.
It's not my fault.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.548
It's no one's fault truly, is it?

07:45.799 --> 07:46.925
How did you two meet?

07:46.925 --> 07:49.636
Auggie was my mentor.

07:49.636 --> 07:53.724
I idolized him.
A visionary who had all the skills.

07:53.724 --> 07:56.059
Not to mention, a gorgeous young wife.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.396
Taught me everything
back when I worked for the government.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.815
Back when I still believed
in the government,

08:01.815 --> 08:04.193
along with Santa Claus and binary systems.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.362
When are you getting
in the private sector, Aug?

08:07.863 --> 08:11.909
You're wasting away in municipal
filtration. A cog in the machine.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.744
Time to get out.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.497
You're right. I should get out.

08:18.749 --> 08:19.750
I have a friend.

08:21.335 --> 08:25.297
Guy's a tech trillionaire in New Zealand.
He's bailing on the whole thing.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.757
"Bailing"? What do you mean?

08:26.757 --> 08:32.596
Well, planet's unlivable clearly.
So, he and his wife signed up to digitize.

08:32.596 --> 08:36.683
I've heard of it.
You upload yourself or something.

08:36.683 --> 08:41.605
And they store you in the cloud
until the planet heals itself.

08:41.605 --> 08:45.943
Whatever that means.
Blue skies, clear lakes, breathable air.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.904
At which point,
they magically reanimate you

08:48.904 --> 08:51.949
into this decarbonized utopia
in a body of your choice.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.911
Are people really signing up
for this nonsense?

08:55.911 --> 08:59.998
People will sign up for anything.
Moon colony, teleportation.

08:59.998 --> 09:04.127
Nobody ever went broke
betting on humanity's misguided optimism.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.712
I heard it worked in a dog.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.841
More champagne.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.844
- I think it's kinda cool.
- Yeah.

09:11.844 --> 09:15.514
The cloud sounds more interesting
than what your generation calls reality.

09:15.514 --> 09:18.016
Okay, I'm sold. What do we bring?

09:18.851 --> 09:20.853
How does one dress for the cloud?

09:20.853 --> 09:23.689
Is there room service? How's the view?

09:23.689 --> 09:26.275
Come on. It's not a hotel, it's a storage.

09:26.859 --> 09:28.360
They just put you to sleep.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.822
Well, then I hope it's a very deep sleep,

09:31.822 --> 09:36.910
and when I wake up, I wanna be
in a 22-year-old body with 2.5% body fat.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.246
You are fine as you are.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.456
Yeah. Joke all you want.

09:41.456 --> 09:45.627
I, for once, would love to wake up,
magically, in a better world.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.213
What makes you think
the world's going to get better?

09:48.213 --> 09:52.134
I mean, obviously, the sacrifice
that everyone's making.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.636
The rations, everything--

09:55.304 --> 10:00.934
Human history is the story of
one terrible catastrophe after another.

10:00.934 --> 10:05.981
Most created by our own
hopelessly incorrigible selfishness.

10:06.857 --> 10:10.235
Well, the problem with beaming
into the future is that wherever we go,

10:10.235 --> 10:13.113
we'll have to take us with us.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.450
Would you go?

10:20.412 --> 10:23.582
The technicians arrive in the morning,
first thing.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.169
Oh, dear! We'd better get packed.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.922
I'm honored to be here
for your last night on Earth, guys.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.965
How do we celebrate?

10:31.965 --> 10:33.300
We are celebrating.

10:33.300 --> 10:37.137
In fact, perhaps that's exactly
what this is tonight.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.473
A going-away party.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.726
You see? I can be festive.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.020
We're not falling for it, old man.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.856
Unless you're suddenly worth
in the trillions, and even then,

10:47.856 --> 10:49.191
you can't get on a list.

10:49.691 --> 10:50.692
Yeah.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.489
Fifteen years ago,
I invested in a small tech company.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.742
The last one up in Marin
before they all went bust.

11:00.244 --> 11:02.329
LifePause.

11:02.955 --> 11:03.997
But--

11:05.165 --> 11:08.627
But nothing you've ever invested in
has ever worked out, Auggie.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.338
This did.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.471
Alpha, play LifePause.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.184
<i>LifePause</i>

11:24.810 --> 11:29.189
<i>Meet Buster,
the world's first fully-uploaded being.</i>

11:30.190 --> 11:33.569
<i>Just months ago,
Buster was suffering from arthritis,</i>

11:33.569 --> 11:36.697
<i>obesity, depression, and climate fatigue.</i>

11:36.697 --> 11:39.616
<i>Using our groundbreaking
neuromapping technology,</i>

11:39.616 --> 11:42.995
<i>scientists were able
to map Buster's entire consciousness</i>

11:42.995 --> 11:44.663
<i>and bring the benefits to you.</i>

11:44.663 --> 11:47.583
<i>For a long time, we thought
consciousness lived in the brain.</i>

11:47.583 --> 11:50.335
<i>Now we know being alive
is a full-body experience.</i>

11:50.836 --> 11:54.798
<i>Our exclusive nanotechnology
maps every neuron of the gut,</i>

11:54.798 --> 11:58.260
<i>the heart, the reproductive system,
even the vocal cords</i>

11:58.260 --> 12:00.762
<i>through a unique procedure
called nanoslicing</i>

12:01.263 --> 12:04.057
<i>to achieve a level of detail
heretofore unimaginable.</i>

12:05.309 --> 12:07.519
<i>After a consciousness is encoded,</i>

12:07.519 --> 12:10.397
<i>it can be uploaded,
stored in unconscious state,</i>

12:10.397 --> 12:12.774
<i>even replicated infinite times,</i>

12:12.774 --> 12:17.738
<i>and reactivated at any point in
a pristine physical vessel of your choice.</i>

12:18.822 --> 12:21.408
<i>Once this technology
becomes widely available,</i>

12:21.408 --> 12:24.620
<i>anyone who cares
about our planet will digitize.</i>

12:24.620 --> 12:28.624
<i>It's the only way to completely erase
your carbon consumption</i>

12:28.624 --> 12:31.835
<i>and experience the full wonders
of our restored ecosystems</i>

12:31.835 --> 12:33.045
<i>when you wake up.</i>

12:33.045 --> 12:37.257
<i>Welcome to the "Same you, better world."</i>

12:37.257 --> 12:39.384
<i>LifePause See you tomorrow</i>

12:39.384 --> 12:42.471
Stop! Stop this insanity.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.306
- <i>LifePause</i>
- Enough is enough. Please.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.475
- <i>See you tomorrow</i>
- Alpha, turn off.

12:47.142 --> 12:51.313
Really, Auggie? It was funny at first,
but you've taken it too far.

12:51.313 --> 12:52.773
I told you, this is not a joke.

12:52.773 --> 12:56.527
The idea that we would give up
our entire lives at the drop of a hat

12:56.527 --> 12:59.196
and beam into the unknown?

12:59.196 --> 13:02.616
- Well, I knew you wouldn't go.
- I wouldn't. You're right.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.326
That's why I'm going without you.

13:04.326 --> 13:07.120
Right. Wait, what?

13:07.120 --> 13:10.541
There's only one ticket.
And there was a lottery for the investors.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.417
I didn't have a plus-one.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.879
I'm sorry. I thought it was obvious.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.884
- So you're--
- I'm--

13:21.552 --> 13:24.555
Yeah, I'm going-- I'm gonna go alone.

13:31.645 --> 13:36.525
Drinks. I think I need more to drink.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.485
Can we get more champagne
out here, please?

13:38.485 --> 13:41.113
No, something stronger. Bottom cabinet.

13:41.113 --> 13:42.948
Something stronger! Bottom cabinet!

13:42.948 --> 13:48.704
You're saying you want to leave me for--

13:48.704 --> 13:52.082
for-- for dogs and windsurfing?

13:52.082 --> 13:53.166
No.

13:58.797 --> 13:59.840
I'll take one too.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.383
Me three. Thanks.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.099
I think we should let you two talk.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.268
Yes, we should just leave. Thank you so--

14:11.268 --> 14:13.645
No, don't go. Please.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.190
It's time to eat.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.150
- Sylvie, I think we should talk.
- No.

14:18.150 --> 14:23.739
Auggie, I put this dinner
together for us for New Year's Eve.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.407
You're going to enjoy it.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.953
Who knows? It may be your last.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.963
Foie gras. From cloned geese in Palo Alto.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.340
Perhaps you are not familiar.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.799
What is it?

14:42.799 --> 14:45.344
- It's liver.
- Probably best just to enjoy it.

14:45.344 --> 14:50.390
Farmers force-feed male ducks by ramming
pipes of grain down their throats.

14:50.974 --> 14:54.895
The birds' livers swell
to ten times their normal size.

14:55.646 --> 14:58.148
They're kept in cages covered in shit.

14:58.649 --> 15:01.485
Some of them choke to death
on their own puke

15:01.485 --> 15:05.280
or tear out their feathers
and attack one another.

15:06.198 --> 15:08.575
Female ducklings are spared that.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.828
Instead, they're tossed, still alive,

15:12.412 --> 15:15.707
into grinders and ground into cat food.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.085
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

15:19.419 --> 15:20.420
Wow.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.803
Wow. That's so inhumane.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.096
Why think about it?

15:29.096 --> 15:32.099
Funny how we call cruelty inhumane,

15:32.099 --> 15:35.018
but really,
what's more human than cruelty?

15:35.018 --> 15:36.395
Right, Auggie?

15:36.395 --> 15:39.064
But females turned into cat food.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.649
- I mean, that's--
- Buck up, Elodie.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.986
It's hardly a shock
to see a female tossed aside.

15:45.112 --> 15:50.075
You're young, but someday you'll find out
what it feels like.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.618
Okay, let's not--

15:51.618 --> 15:53.245
Sylvie, you just don't understand.

15:53.245 --> 15:57.291
I'm not tossing you aside.
This is actually not about you.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.584
Silly me.

15:59.376 --> 16:03.964
My husband would rather be nanosliced
than spend one more day in my presence,

16:03.964 --> 16:06.925
and I mistakenly gather it's about me.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.927
Well, I think what he's trying to say is--

16:08.927 --> 16:10.888
I miss sunsets.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.098
I wanna feel rain.

16:13.682 --> 16:18.061
I wanna breathe real air without a mask.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.481
I wanna eat something besides kelp

16:21.481 --> 16:24.401
that doesn't cost me
six months' carbon rations.

16:24.401 --> 16:29.031
It's not that bad. I mean, my God,
people have survived much, much worse.

16:30.240 --> 16:35.204
Even in the worst of times, people could
still look up and see the stars.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.249
I want wilderness, Sylvie.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.752
Everybody wants wilderness...

16:44.087 --> 16:46.089
but we also want love.

16:48.342 --> 16:51.136
Wilderness vanished years ago, Auggie.

16:52.513 --> 16:53.597
You chose love.

16:54.473 --> 16:58.519
- You chose love, kids, a family.
- You guys have kids?

16:58.519 --> 17:00.270
- Elodie, don't.
- Yes, we do.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.730
- No, we don't.
- Yes, we do.

17:01.730 --> 17:02.898
We don't!

17:08.529 --> 17:10.071
I'm sorry. Did I say something?

17:10.071 --> 17:12.281
- It's--
- I shouldn't have, right?

17:15.285 --> 17:16.619
I should go after her.

17:16.619 --> 17:17.704
No.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.580
Let me.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.210
Thank you.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.429
I don't think
he's really gonna go through with it.

17:35.514 --> 17:38.183
- He adores you.
- Who cares either way?

17:39.017 --> 17:40.102
You don't mean that.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.436
Oh, no?

17:45.107 --> 17:46.108
What?

17:47.526 --> 17:52.114
I was imagining how fantastic it would be

17:52.114 --> 17:57.953
if they accidentally woke Auggie up
in Buster's body.

17:59.454 --> 18:04.710
Like, just trapped in there like...
"I'm Auggie."

18:06.044 --> 18:08.463
"I'm not a dog."

18:12.092 --> 18:14.303
It'd serve him right, honestly.

18:16.430 --> 18:21.185
Listen, Sylvie.
You have every right to be angry,

18:22.227 --> 18:27.065
but the truth is,
I'd kill for what you guys have.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.109
Please.

18:29.985 --> 18:32.654
I bounce from person to person.

18:32.654 --> 18:36.825
Elodie, Eleanor, Eloise.
It's all the same.

18:36.825 --> 18:39.494
Virtual, AI.

18:40.078 --> 18:43.665
Even the real ones have the chip,
so when they're having sex with you,

18:45.042 --> 18:48.295
they're actually having sex
with someone else in their mind.

18:48.879 --> 18:54.468
They're searching porn or ex-boyfriends,
or ex-girlfriends, or God knows what.

18:56.470 --> 18:59.014
I used to not mind it, you know.

18:59.014 --> 19:03.519
Cuts down
on the pesky complications of intimacy.

19:04.520 --> 19:09.024
But now I'm starting to feel like
I might as well not even exist.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.490
You wanna talk about digitizing?

19:17.533 --> 19:19.576
I feel like I already have.

19:20.911 --> 19:22.496
Did he tell you he was going?

19:23.830 --> 19:26.124
I imagine he'd want to impress you,

19:26.875 --> 19:30.087
the protégé who outshone him
so completely.

19:30.087 --> 19:33.131
No. No, I was as in the dark as you are.

19:35.259 --> 19:42.057
Then I guess we're both sort of
in this together, aren't we?

19:43.851 --> 19:48.021
Both of us left behind.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.398
You're drunk.

19:59.741 --> 20:00.742
Are you--

20:02.744 --> 20:04.246
Are you flirting with me?

20:05.414 --> 20:10.294
So, I've been trying to get my art career
off the ground for years now.

20:11.503 --> 20:14.840
That's one of the reasons why I came here,
'cause Sylvie's an art dealer and...

20:15.465 --> 20:19.761
And I personally like
to work with discarded or found material.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.930
- Right.
- I love to work with dung

20:21.930 --> 20:23.098
- because it just--
- Dung?

20:23.098 --> 20:24.641
Yeah, because honestly,

20:24.641 --> 20:26.977
if we don't find the beauty
in our waste these days,

20:26.977 --> 20:29.188
I mean, where will we find it, right?

20:29.813 --> 20:31.023
I don't know.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.486
I have to say...

20:40.574 --> 20:42.659
I think what you're doing is very brave.

20:42.659 --> 20:47.873
To just take a leap into the unknown.
To completely erase your carbon footprint.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.210
I don't know a lot of people
that would be courageous enough

20:51.210 --> 20:52.878
to do something like this.

20:55.714 --> 20:57.674
I just think you have one problem.

20:57.674 --> 20:58.759
What's that?

21:00.135 --> 21:02.971
Well, you still love your wife.

21:04.473 --> 21:10.771
I don't think we should make this night
any more complicated than it already is.

21:12.689 --> 21:16.109
I'm not talking about
anything complicated.

21:18.195 --> 21:19.279
You're not?

21:20.864 --> 21:24.368
What I'm talking about, it's very simple.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.539
Bodies in space.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.458
Physical attraction.

21:32.626 --> 21:36.463
Two lonely people finding each other.

21:37.673 --> 21:39.591
Comforting each other.

21:42.594 --> 21:45.180
Whoa. Whoa.

21:47.516 --> 21:49.351
I'm sorry. I thought--

21:51.854 --> 21:53.313
You know...

21:54.147 --> 21:55.148
What?

21:57.401 --> 21:59.194
I don't touch.

22:01.113 --> 22:05.450
Yes, you don't. I forgot.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.038
What about with Auggie?

22:10.831 --> 22:11.874
I...

22:14.209 --> 22:17.087
I can't remember when.

22:17.921 --> 22:22.426
You say you want wilderness.
You're already in it. You both are.

22:22.926 --> 22:26.471
Fucking lost in the wild
of human relationships.

22:26.471 --> 22:30.767
The only way out of it is together. Right?

22:31.602 --> 22:34.479
Maybe you're just doing this
to see if she still cares.

22:35.981 --> 22:39.902
Things haven't been good
between us for a very long time.

22:40.736 --> 22:44.364
And I know
that times can always get better,

22:44.948 --> 22:46.366
but, quite frankly,

22:47.034 --> 22:52.164
I'm more optimistic that
the Earth will heal than that we will.

22:52.748 --> 22:57.961
So, no skin on skin?

23:11.308 --> 23:12.726
<i>So what are you proposing?</i>

23:12.726 --> 23:14.686
I want your spot on the lifeboat.

23:15.646 --> 23:16.813
You wanna digitize?

23:16.813 --> 23:19.441
From the four of us,
I'm the one who should go.

23:20.317 --> 23:23.070
I'm young. Sorry.

23:23.070 --> 23:25.948
I'm strong enough to build
whatever needs to be built.

23:25.948 --> 23:31.703
I'm a joiner. I'm open-minded.
I'm eco-conscious. I'm tech-savvy.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.455
I have three million followers,

23:33.455 --> 23:36.083
and everything I post gets two
to three million bangs.

23:36.083 --> 23:40.045
Yeah, but don't you have people
or parents?

23:41.088 --> 23:42.297
Or Nic? You got Nic.

23:42.297 --> 23:45.968
It's no one that is worth
passing up an opportunity like this.

23:46.552 --> 23:47.886
The truth is I'm just broke.

23:47.886 --> 23:49.638
I'm a dasher for my day job

23:49.638 --> 23:52.432
and I strip online
for black-market carbon, and I just--

23:52.432 --> 23:55.727
I'm doing all of this just
so that I can keep the lights on,

23:55.727 --> 23:59.356
so I can do my art after work hours,
but I just can't keep up.

23:59.982 --> 24:01.733
I am meant for the future.

24:02.693 --> 24:04.069
- Eloise.
- Elodie.

24:04.069 --> 24:04.987
Right.

24:04.987 --> 24:10.033
Even if I wanted to give you this spot,
which I actually don't, I couldn't.

24:10.576 --> 24:12.119
It's nontransferable.

24:12.119 --> 24:15.080
- Everything is DNA verified.
- Okay.

24:15.080 --> 24:18.417
Well, you can give me a fingernail
or a hair of your beard.

24:18.417 --> 24:21.879
Also, there's a very
in-depth psychological evaluation,

24:21.879 --> 24:26.758
which, no offense,
but I don't think you'd pass.

24:26.758 --> 24:28.844
What's in the evaluation?

24:34.099 --> 24:36.101
Alpha, turn on LifePause.

24:38.729 --> 24:41.398
- It's actually just a series of questions.
- Okay.

24:41.398 --> 24:43.609
How are you so beautiful?

24:45.527 --> 24:47.112
You're so beautiful.

24:47.112 --> 24:50.073
"Have you ever thought
about harming yourself?"

24:52.993 --> 24:56.371
"How many sexual partners have you had,
and how were they?"

24:56.371 --> 24:59.833
- I wish I could touch you.
- But you can't.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.253
"What is your favorite flavor of ice cream
and why?"

25:03.253 --> 25:04.505
Well, that's easy.

25:04.505 --> 25:06.381
Mint chip. It's delicious.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.888
"Have you ever been in love,
and how did you know?"

25:14.806 --> 25:15.849
"Are you spiritual?"

25:15.849 --> 25:17.309
Oh, yes.

25:17.309 --> 25:19.478
"If yes, what do you believe in?"

25:19.478 --> 25:20.687
Oh, God.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.981
"What would you do
if you were suddenly faced

25:22.981 --> 25:24.816
with an enormous brown bear?"

25:25.484 --> 25:28.654
Oh, yeah, that--
Some of the questions are simulations.

25:29.238 --> 25:30.155
Oh, my God!

25:34.952 --> 25:37.788
It's holo.
It's just a exercise, it's not real.

25:37.788 --> 25:39.831
- Wait, wait.
- No! It's--

25:40.624 --> 25:44.545
- It's gonna kill me!
- It's fine! Don't run!

25:44.545 --> 25:47.339
It's-- Elodie!

25:48.882 --> 25:50.801
No! Leave me, please!

25:50.801 --> 25:52.678
Auggie? What's going on?

25:52.678 --> 25:56.431
It's nothing.
It's a psych eval for LifePause.

25:56.431 --> 25:58.684
Elodie wanted to see it.

25:59.518 --> 26:02.062
Alpha! Turn off LifePause!

26:04.648 --> 26:06.942
What is it evaluating exactly?

26:08.110 --> 26:11.947
I guess...
basic survival skills in the wild?

26:14.491 --> 26:16.159
Or maybe a person's ability

26:16.159 --> 26:19.454
to distinguish
between fantasy and what's real?

26:21.248 --> 26:23.834
Obviously, you'd make a good candidate.

26:27.337 --> 26:28.547
I wouldn't go.

26:29.673 --> 26:32.718
I would never, ever go.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.179
I wouldn't give up.

26:35.179 --> 26:37.389
Sylvie, I--

26:39.516 --> 26:42.102
I didn't wanna hurt you.

26:43.687 --> 26:44.855
You didn't.

26:45.522 --> 26:49.568
Okay, but listen. It's-- I guess,

26:50.485 --> 26:53.155
I didn't think you'd care
if I left or not.

26:55.157 --> 26:56.783
How can you say that?

26:57.993 --> 27:00.871
I didn't think there was anything left
between us anymore.

27:01.872 --> 27:03.540
Don't try to justify it.

27:03.540 --> 27:04.750
Really. Please!

27:04.750 --> 27:08.128
You gotta understand,
this is as much of a shock to me

27:08.128 --> 27:09.546
as it is to you, in a way.

27:09.546 --> 27:11.632
I mean, I never imagined
that it would work

27:11.632 --> 27:13.425
and that I'd be picked for the lottery.

27:13.425 --> 27:16.553
And, certainly, I hoped I'd get a chance
to talk to you about it first.

27:17.763 --> 27:19.264
But you never listen to me.

27:20.807 --> 27:23.143
You barely even look at me anymore.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.855
And I know I've disappointed you.

27:28.273 --> 27:33.737
I know this is not the life
that either one of us envisioned it to be.

27:34.947 --> 27:37.991
I mean, I'm disappointed too.

27:38.575 --> 27:39.576
But...

27:41.411 --> 27:43.997
we could never communicate
without fighting.

27:43.997 --> 27:46.792
- Where's Elodie?
- Nic, can you give us a minute?

27:46.792 --> 27:47.876
Yeah.

27:47.876 --> 27:49.503
Wait, don't go.

27:55.926 --> 27:57.094
What?

27:57.803 --> 27:58.804
No.

27:58.804 --> 28:00.222
- What is it, buddy?
- What?

28:00.222 --> 28:01.306
Are you--

28:02.599 --> 28:03.684
Did you--

28:04.518 --> 28:07.437
No, you didn't. Did you?

28:07.437 --> 28:08.605
What did--

28:09.648 --> 28:11.900
I-- What?

28:11.900 --> 28:14.361
You couldn't even wait until I go?

28:14.361 --> 28:17.573
Auggie. It-- It's not what you think.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.658
It-- It was...

28:21.535 --> 28:23.579
She started...

28:26.123 --> 28:27.249
it.

28:28.208 --> 28:30.669
"She started it"?

28:31.295 --> 28:32.754
What are you, six?

28:32.754 --> 28:33.839
So, it's true?

28:33.839 --> 28:35.465
No! I--

28:36.675 --> 28:41.263
Okay, yes,
but it was completely contactless.

28:41.263 --> 28:44.600
- Right.
- And, of course,

28:44.600 --> 28:48.228
it's still stupid and awful.

28:48.228 --> 28:50.772
- Well, I don't think it was--
- Shut up, Nic!

28:52.232 --> 28:56.069
But it was only because you were--

28:57.279 --> 29:01.742
I mean, we are both-- You're leaving us.

29:01.742 --> 29:05.162
And-- And it happened!

29:05.162 --> 29:07.164
Well, this is just perfect!

29:08.373 --> 29:11.710
It's just really perfect!

29:13.212 --> 29:18.425
You just had to have the final victory,
didn't you?

29:19.635 --> 29:23.013
One last kick to the face
and then just send me on my way!

29:23.013 --> 29:25.849
That's not what this was.

29:25.849 --> 29:27.518
- Excuse me.
- What is it?

29:28.727 --> 29:32.356
I am sorry. Just, dinner is served.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.292
Thank you.

29:56.088 --> 29:57.881
Would you like some tomatoes, sir?

29:57.881 --> 29:59.132
- No.
- Okay.

30:09.268 --> 30:10.602
Alpha, off.

30:15.983 --> 30:17.276
I'd like to make a toast.

30:17.276 --> 30:19.486
Okay, I think I'll just be-- Okay, bye.

30:20.863 --> 30:22.614
A toast of gratitude, really.

30:23.782 --> 30:28.245
See, it's my last night on Earth,
in this particular era, anyway.

30:28.245 --> 30:29.496
And honestly,

30:29.496 --> 30:34.001
a part of me thought that
it would be sort of a bland farewell.

30:34.543 --> 30:37.713
Great meal, couple of funny stories.

30:38.338 --> 30:40.841
Like that time
we went on that karaoke bender,

30:40.841 --> 30:43.969
until we sang every last song
from the Blue Ivy Carter Holiday Album.

30:44.595 --> 30:47.806
You had the whole audience transfixed
by the sound of your voice.

30:49.141 --> 30:50.726
You had me, anyway.

30:51.935 --> 30:55.063
And so I thought,
let's just let be bygones be bygones.

30:56.064 --> 30:58.483
Bury a couple of our many hatchets.

30:58.483 --> 31:03.155
Find some resolution for my time here,
for our time here.

31:04.615 --> 31:07.910
Because there were some good times.

31:10.454 --> 31:12.331
But things have taken a turn.

31:14.416 --> 31:16.168
Some might wonder if I'm angry.

31:19.046 --> 31:20.547
It's my last night on Earth.

31:20.547 --> 31:22.841
My wife fucks my friend.

31:22.841 --> 31:26.386
Someone whom I've worked with
and mentored.

31:27.387 --> 31:30.766
I've always looked up to you.
It was contactless.

31:30.766 --> 31:34.478
The truth is,
you both have given me a great gift.

31:36.104 --> 31:41.151
If ever I had any doubt about digitizing,
you have utterly squashed them.

31:41.151 --> 31:47.074
You leave me now with zero regrets,
no second thoughts,

31:47.074 --> 31:50.160
nothing but excitement
about what's to come.

31:51.328 --> 31:54.623
So, I wanna thank you, both of you,

31:55.332 --> 31:59.461
for making my decision
to leave you forever

32:01.213 --> 32:07.386
so absolutely and appallingly clear.

32:10.055 --> 32:13.809
So, cheers.

32:32.578 --> 32:36.248
To my darling Auggie,

32:37.165 --> 32:44.173
I'd be lying if I said I hadn't, at times,
fantasized about something like this.

32:45.632 --> 32:48.468
What wife hasn't thought
about how lovely it would be

32:48.468 --> 32:53.348
to slowly slice up her husband
like a giant, juicy melon?

32:53.348 --> 32:59.104
So, thank you, Auggie,
for ending our time so seamlessly,

32:59.104 --> 33:01.940
and for once in your life,

33:02.566 --> 33:06.445
planning
and organizing something yourself.

33:08.822 --> 33:12.451
I guess there's a lot
to celebrate tonight after all.

33:19.958 --> 33:23.545
- I also have something to say.
- It's clearly not the time--

33:27.132 --> 33:28.800
You're all fucking crazy.

33:29.384 --> 33:32.721
He's crazy, she's crazy,
and you're crazy for bringing me here.

33:35.057 --> 33:37.392
We're over. That's all.

33:40.354 --> 33:46.235
Well, I suppose
if we're all making toasts,

33:46.235 --> 33:47.653
I'll say a few words.

33:49.488 --> 33:50.489
Auggie...

33:52.866 --> 33:56.703
I'm sorry I had contactless sex with
your wife on your last night on Earth.

33:56.703 --> 33:59.665
It wasn't my intention to hurt you
or ruin your evening.

33:59.665 --> 34:02.042
It's fine. It was a drunken mistake.

34:02.042 --> 34:04.336
No, that's the thing
I wanted to clarify actually.

34:06.839 --> 34:09.091
Yeah, I wanna say this.

34:10.884 --> 34:12.010
This feels right.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.471
This was no mistake for me.

34:15.848 --> 34:20.393
I am-- I've always been in love with you.

34:22.271 --> 34:23.355
Jesus Christ.

34:23.355 --> 34:26.315
I've been in love with her
for well over a decade now.

34:26.315 --> 34:28.527
Since the first time I saw her, actually.

34:28.527 --> 34:34.074
We have come close to hooking up
a couple of times over the years.

34:34.949 --> 34:36.368
No, we didn't.

34:36.368 --> 34:37.786
At my dad's funeral.

34:37.786 --> 34:42.708
Come on! It was just a hug.
I felt bad for you.

34:42.708 --> 34:46.920
And, of course, Sylvie's the reason
I could never be with anyone else.

34:48.088 --> 34:51.216
Not really. Everyone paled in comparison.

34:53.886 --> 34:56.304
I don't think you're crazy
for wanting to get the hell out of here,

34:56.304 --> 35:03.270
but I do think you're crazy
for leaving your wife.

35:04.229 --> 35:07.149
An amazing, beautiful woman.

35:08.483 --> 35:12.779
I hope that when Auggie's gone...

35:14.323 --> 35:15.741
Jesus.

35:16.408 --> 35:17.701
- Get him! Yes!
- Auggie! No!

35:17.701 --> 35:20.412
- The food! No!
- Shut it! Don't even--

35:20.412 --> 35:22.956
Cheating, wife-stealing--

35:22.956 --> 35:24.583
- Auggie!
- You stay away from my wife.

35:24.583 --> 35:27.169
- I'll fucking kill you, you fuckface!
- Get off of him!

35:27.169 --> 35:29.004
Leave him alone!

35:29.004 --> 35:31.882
- Get off of him! Get off of him!
- No!

35:31.882 --> 35:34.343
Enough!

35:34.343 --> 35:38.263
Daddy? What's going on?

35:38.263 --> 35:40.182
Go back to bed, Agnes.

35:40.182 --> 35:42.643
What are you doing?

35:42.643 --> 35:43.727
It's--

35:43.727 --> 35:47.731
We're just playing a little game, honey.
Funny, right?

35:47.731 --> 35:48.815
Can I play?

35:48.815 --> 35:52.027
No, sweetheart, you should be in bed.
Let me take you back up, okay?

35:52.027 --> 35:54.363
- They do have a child.
- It's complicated.

35:54.363 --> 35:55.447
No, sweetie.

35:55.447 --> 35:58.408
- I'm gonna put her to sleep.
- No, please don't do that.

35:58.408 --> 36:00.077
- I have to.
- Don't.

36:00.077 --> 36:01.787
Agnes, go to sleep.

36:07.167 --> 36:10.170
- I hate it when you do that.
- I know. I hate it too.

36:11.463 --> 36:14.424
But maybe it's time
we all gave up our illusions.

36:15.175 --> 36:16.593
I'll take her back upstairs.

36:28.522 --> 36:32.860
- Is she a...
- Yep. Infertility-bot.

36:32.860 --> 36:35.153
I've never seen one so real.

36:36.613 --> 36:38.282
I think you should go now.

36:39.950 --> 36:42.119
- Sure. Of course.
- Yeah.

36:43.745 --> 36:47.916
Sylvie. Sylvie? I was talking to
Auggie about maybe giving me his ticket.

36:48.417 --> 36:49.835
I really wanna go.

36:50.669 --> 36:55.966
You're young. You have time.
One day, everyone will be doing it.

36:56.800 --> 36:57.801
Yeah.

36:58.302 --> 36:59.720
We need our oxygen.

37:01.013 --> 37:02.097
Annie?

37:09.229 --> 37:10.689
Sorry for the mess.

37:10.689 --> 37:11.982
Not a problem.

37:11.982 --> 37:14.109
And the food was delicious, really.

37:14.109 --> 37:18.488
I didn't make it. I'm just the server.
Freelance. Maid.

37:19.907 --> 37:21.283
Do you have the chip?

37:21.283 --> 37:22.826
No, I could never afford it.

37:22.826 --> 37:24.953
I know a guy that does it for very cheap.

37:24.953 --> 37:27.122
If you're okay with ads, yeah?

37:29.374 --> 37:30.375
Here you go.

37:36.006 --> 37:37.132
Happy New Year's.

37:41.011 --> 37:42.513
Tell him to have fun up there.

37:42.513 --> 37:45.641
I will. If he remembers how.

37:47.226 --> 37:50.354
He was a good friend.
Tell him I'm sorry--

37:50.354 --> 37:51.855
I will. Bye, Nic.

37:58.946 --> 38:00.697
- Sylvie, if there's a chance--
- Bye.

38:00.697 --> 38:01.782
I--

38:10.958 --> 38:14.336
It's okay, you can go up and turn in.
I'll finish this up and let myself out.

38:14.336 --> 38:17.464
It's New Year's Eve.
Didn't you say you had somewhere to be?

38:17.464 --> 38:18.590
No, nowhere.

38:21.426 --> 38:24.471
The last heat wave wiped out my family
and most of my friends.

38:26.139 --> 38:28.475
I was a massage therapist in Burbank.

38:29.601 --> 38:30.978
When there was a Burbank.

38:32.813 --> 38:34.398
I'm so sorry.

38:35.315 --> 38:36.525
Anyway, it's funny.

38:38.318 --> 38:39.987
Your life looks pretty good to me.

38:40.571 --> 38:42.447
Oh, yeah.

38:44.616 --> 38:48.120
- Let me give you that tip.
- No, you already said not to expect, so...

38:48.120 --> 38:49.621
The least I can do.

38:50.622 --> 38:51.623
Thanks.

39:19.610 --> 39:21.236
I suppose you have to pack.

39:22.863 --> 39:24.031
Or maybe you don't.

39:25.532 --> 39:27.326
Do you have to pack?

39:28.994 --> 39:30.329
Can I pack your voice?

39:32.748 --> 39:33.749
No.

39:37.377 --> 39:39.671
I sing to her every night, Auggie.

39:41.048 --> 39:42.049
I know you do.

39:46.178 --> 39:47.763
I know it's ridiculous.

39:50.057 --> 39:51.642
I know she can't hear me.

39:53.810 --> 39:55.187
It is not ridiculous.

39:59.650 --> 40:06.073
You're going tomorrow, but the truth is,
you left a long time ago.

40:07.199 --> 40:08.575
And I don't blame you.

40:10.035 --> 40:11.203
I've been cruel.

40:14.331 --> 40:15.624
I get it.

40:16.792 --> 40:18.377
You want wilderness.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.672
You want to see stars.

40:24.299 --> 40:25.467
Sylvie, I--

40:32.057 --> 40:33.517
I don't want to go.

40:34.810 --> 40:35.811
Don't.

40:37.688 --> 40:42.609
Don't stay out of guilt
or because you're afraid.

40:42.609 --> 40:43.902
That's not it.

40:48.323 --> 40:49.491
I just don't wanna...

40:53.453 --> 40:54.454
I don't wanna...

40:58.041 --> 40:59.209
give up on us.

41:00.502 --> 41:02.504
Or this whole miserable planet.

41:05.215 --> 41:06.300
I love you.

41:08.010 --> 41:09.761
I love you too, Auggie.

41:24.276 --> 41:25.319
What's that?

41:25.319 --> 41:26.403
It's midnight.

41:27.821 --> 41:29.698
Come on, let's go. Come on.

41:32.326 --> 41:34.119
Part of this-- Come, I'll show you.

41:53.514 --> 41:55.140
Happy New Year, Auggie.

41:56.475 --> 41:57.726
Happy New Year.

42:12.074 --> 42:16.870
<i>A happy and healthy 2069
to all our friends in the Bay Area.</i>

42:16.870 --> 42:20.499
<i>At this hour, prosecutors at the
International Criminal Court in The Hague</i>

42:20.499 --> 42:24.628
<i>are preparing additional indictments
against individuals and corporations</i>

42:24.628 --> 42:28.465
<i>accused of committing ecocide

<i>The tribunal on climate crimes</i>

43:23.896 --> 43:25.898
- August?
- Augustine.

43:27.733 --> 43:29.151
It says ''male.''

43:30.319 --> 43:33.197
I don't see how my gender identity
is any of your business.

43:34.948 --> 43:36.325
DNA sample?

43:38.243 --> 43:39.244
Here. Just...

43:48.420 --> 43:51.215
Okay. That works. You're good to go.
