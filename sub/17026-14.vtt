Frank, we got to get
these tele admits up.

02:21.639 --> 02:24.199
I'm all over it.
There's at least
30 in the rack.

02:24.199 --> 02:25.879
What were you guys
doing last night?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.719
Playing Guitar Hero
and doing Jell-O shots.

02:27.719 --> 02:29.479
Two messages from Kelly.
Kelly who?

02:29.479 --> 02:30.679
She said you'd know.

02:30.679 --> 02:32.279
That's her phone
number at Swissotel.

02:32.279 --> 02:33.879
Car crash victim coming in.

02:33.879 --> 02:36.119
Oh, OK, clear
Trauma One and get surgery.

02:36.119 --> 02:38.239
We're gridlocked.
Quick dispo in Curtain One.

02:38.239 --> 02:40.399
Grady?
Off duty
and going to Jumbo Mart

02:40.399 --> 02:42.519
for enough caffeine to get
me through my charting.

02:42.519 --> 02:43.799
Well, who else is on?

02:43.799 --> 02:45.799
Well, we got,
er, Brenner, Morris...

02:45.799 --> 02:46.999
What do you need?

02:46.999 --> 02:48.079
That's OK.

02:48.079 --> 02:49.279
I haven't picked
up a patient yet.

02:49.279 --> 02:51.199
No, go, er,
meet the trauma.
It's busy.

02:51.199 --> 02:52.479
I got time.

02:52.479 --> 02:54.119
OK, fooling around
with her boyfriend

02:54.119 --> 02:56.119
and they lost
the condom.

02:56.119 --> 02:58.279
She's fully dressed in
the middle of the ER.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.479
She should be in a gown
in a private room

03:00.479 --> 03:02.519
with a chaperone for a pelvic.
Yeah, there's
no need, actually.

03:02.519 --> 03:06.599
What?
Go on. Go get the history.

03:08.238 --> 03:10.398
Hello. I'm Dr Gates.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.438
Tammy.

03:11.438 --> 03:14.118
So, the, er, proverbial
lost condom, huh?

03:14.118 --> 03:16.038
Yeah.
It's kind of embarrassing.

03:16.038 --> 03:18.118
Well, don't worry.
Tell me what happened.

03:18.118 --> 03:21.838
The condom came off,
and I couldn't reach it.

03:21.838 --> 03:24.878
My boyfriend tried to help,
but he's useless.

03:24.878 --> 03:26.398
I went to the bathroom

03:26.398 --> 03:27.998
and gagged myself,

03:27.998 --> 03:31.078
but I couldn't
vomit it up either.

03:31.078 --> 03:34.278
I'm not gonna...
suffocate, am I?

03:36.678 --> 03:39.238
Dr Rasgotra.

03:39.238 --> 03:40.878
Dr Brenner.

03:46.278 --> 03:47.598
Mm.

03:47.598 --> 03:49.198
How was your night?

03:49.198 --> 03:50.758
Four hours of sleep.

03:50.758 --> 03:52.798
Well, you would've got
a lot less than that

03:52.798 --> 03:54.278
if you were in my bad.

03:54.278 --> 03:57.198
Next time, you should
spend the night with
me in the call room.

03:57.198 --> 03:59.678
What, you mean on a twin bed
with scratchy sheets

03:59.678 --> 04:01.158
and phone interruptions
every hour?
(GIGGLES)

04:01.158 --> 04:03.678
That's kind of hot.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.918
You know, I was
thinking of, um,

04:05.918 --> 04:08.078
getting Neil Young
tickets for Saturday.

04:08.078 --> 04:09.918
That sounds good.

04:09.918 --> 04:11.798
You like him?
Yeah, I love him.

04:11.798 --> 04:13.438
Especially
his early stuff.
Really?

04:13.438 --> 04:16.118
Yeah. Old Man,
Only Love Can Break Your Heart...

04:16.118 --> 04:17.918
Heart Of Gold.
Heart Of Gold.

04:19.878 --> 04:20.998
Neela!

04:20.998 --> 04:23.478
Uh, trauma coming in.

04:23.478 --> 04:24.878
Thank you.
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:24.878 --> 04:26.278
Are we out of sugar?

04:26.278 --> 04:27.998
I don't think so.

04:37.038 --> 04:38.998
What are they doing?

04:38.998 --> 04:42.558
Our old medical records
are going in remote storage.

04:42.558 --> 04:45.917
Let me ask you something,
kind of man to man.

04:45.917 --> 04:48.077
Do you believe in
the three-date rule?

04:48.077 --> 04:49.917
You seeing someone new?

04:49.917 --> 04:52.717
I don't know if we're actually
"seeing" each other.

04:52.717 --> 04:54.717
We had lunch together
in the cafeteria.

04:54.717 --> 04:56.917
I bought her a burger
one night at Ike's.

04:56.917 --> 04:58.757
Wow, sounds serious.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.757
I like her.

05:00.757 --> 05:02.797
I just can't tell if
she's interested in me.

05:02.797 --> 05:04.237
Well, I'm pretty sure

05:04.237 --> 05:06.917
I'm not the right guy to ask
for relationship advice.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.117
Hey. The run
got diverted to Mercy.

05:27.117 --> 05:30.637
Whoa. Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

05:30.637 --> 05:32.677
Hey. You all right?

05:32.677 --> 05:34.717
Tony... Archie,
I need some help.

05:34.717 --> 05:35.957

07:02.276 --> 07:03.276
Hey. Why so quiet?

07:03.356 --> 07:05.076
No, they're extra quiet

gonna be normal, too.

Not if there's a brain bleed.

11:36.673 --> 11:39.273

it's always something metabolic.

I'm sorry you had
to pull me out of my car.

12:03.713 --> 12:05.513
Is the oxygen helping, Donna?

12:05.513 --> 12:06.993
I think so.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.033
Have you ever had any
trouble breathing before?

12:09.033 --> 12:10.553
Not till last week.

12:10.553 --> 12:12.273
Mom, I parked the car.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.153
Thanks, honey.
That's my son Dylan.

12:14.153 --> 12:15.273
Hey.

12:15.273 --> 12:16.753
She couldn't even talk.

12:16.753 --> 12:19.593
So you were saying
about last week?

12:19.593 --> 12:21.793
They told me
I had lung cancer.

12:21.793 --> 12:23.433
Where are you being treated?

12:23.433 --> 12:25.833
Uh, nowhere yet.
We were supposed

12:25.833 --> 12:27.873
to go to Northwestern,
but in the car

12:27.873 --> 12:30.313
her breathing got so bad
that I-I pulled into here.

12:30.313 --> 12:32.193
I have papers and X-rays, if...

12:33.593 --> 12:35.313
The Willow Ridge Medical Centre.

12:35.313 --> 12:36.633
That's our local hospital.

12:36.633 --> 12:38.553
That's where they diagnosed me.
OK.

12:38.553 --> 12:40.473
Do you smoke
cigarettes, Donna?

12:40.473 --> 12:41.793
10 to 15%

12:41.793 --> 12:44.273
of lung cancer occurs
in non-smokers.

12:44.273 --> 12:45.553
We've been
on the internet a bit.

12:45.553 --> 12:47.553
It's in the left
upper lobe.

12:47.553 --> 12:49.273
Liver function tests
are elevated.

12:49.273 --> 12:52.992
OK. And did they explain the
brain CT results to you, Donna?

12:53.992 --> 12:55.352
Two spots.

12:55.352 --> 12:58.512
They thought that, um,
surgery and chemo and radiation

12:58.512 --> 13:00.232
could buy me some time.

13:00.232 --> 13:02.072
Uh, stage-four lung cancer

13:02.072 --> 13:04.712
has a five-year survival rate of 5%,

13:04.712 --> 13:06.552
but 1 in 20 survive.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.112
(BRENNER) OK, well,

13:08.112 --> 13:11.432
we'll have our surgeons
and oncologists consult.

13:11.432 --> 13:13.312
I was hoping
to go to Northwestern.

13:13.312 --> 13:15.112
Yeah, you're too sick to move.

13:15.112 --> 13:17.112
Yeah, I'm gonna cancel
the audition, Mom.

13:17.112 --> 13:19.512
No, Dylan, you're not
cancelling anything.

13:19.512 --> 13:21.472
No. Get to orchestra
hall on time,

13:21.472 --> 13:23.472
and you can stay with
Aunt Harriet tonight.

13:23.472 --> 13:24.432
OK?

13:25.432 --> 13:26.792
OK.

13:29.432 --> 13:32.592
Dr Morris, I'm looking for
an old guy, victim of assault.

13:32.592 --> 13:34.232
He should be
right back.

13:34.232 --> 13:35.952
OK.

13:35.952 --> 13:37.872
You know,
I could be wrong,

13:37.872 --> 13:40.512
but I thought I saw
you and Officer Diaz

13:40.512 --> 13:44.032
eating lunch
the other day.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.952
Yeah, we-we were
on a case together.

13:45.952 --> 13:48.992
Really. Cos I've
had cases with you,

13:48.992 --> 13:50.832
but we've never
had lunch together.

13:50.832 --> 13:52.712
Plus, it must've
been a funny case,

13:52.712 --> 13:55.472
cos I noticed
a lot of smiling.

13:55.472 --> 13:58.392
Yeah, well, Officer Diaz
is a nice lady.

13:58.392 --> 13:59.912
We all know that.

13:59.912 --> 14:02.232
And I know you know
that cops stick together.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.432
Yeah.

14:03.432 --> 14:05.032
So be careful.

14:05.032 --> 14:08.712
If you break her heart,
we may have to break you.

14:09.952 --> 14:11.992
Head CT was normal,
just as I predicted.

14:11.992 --> 14:13.352
And guess what?
He's hypernatremic.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.632
How bad is
his sodium?

14:14.632 --> 14:16.232
165. Dry as a bone.

14:16.232 --> 14:17.552
Does this guy talk?

14:17.552 --> 14:18.632
Not really.

14:18.632 --> 14:20.272
I'll check for
Missing Person reports.

14:20.272 --> 14:22.552
Did you calculate the
free water deficit?
Yep, six litres.

14:22.552 --> 14:24.752
OK. Hypernatremia shouldn't
be corrected at a rate...

14:24.752 --> 14:26.912
One milli-equivalent
per litre per hour.

14:28.831 --> 14:30.911
Need a doctor here.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.111
You can have Dr Gates.

14:34.111 --> 14:36.751
Well... No, shouldn't
I stay here and finish?
No, you've been

14:36.751 --> 14:39.591
wanting off this case
from the get-go. See ya.

14:39.591 --> 14:40.951
He's starting to
open his eyes.

14:40.951 --> 14:42.111
That's a good sign.
Mm-hmm.

14:45.191 --> 14:47.951
(MORRIS) Oliver... Oliver,
try to squeeze my hand.

14:47.951 --> 14:49.391
Oliver...

14:51.191 --> 14:52.991
Curtain Three is open.

14:54.951 --> 14:57.671
Hi, I'm Dr Gates.
Damien.

14:57.671 --> 14:59.231
My wife, Corazon.
Hello.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.751
Sam, did you
ever call Kelly?

15:00.751 --> 15:03.311
I didn't think so, cos
now she's coming to see you.

15:03.311 --> 15:04.951
Let me know when
she gets here.

15:04.951 --> 15:06.351
You don't see
many of these.

15:06.351 --> 15:08.551
It's a negative pressure
ventilator.

15:08.551 --> 15:10.391
When the air is sucked
out of the chamber,

15:10.391 --> 15:12.231
it flows into his lungs.

15:12.231 --> 15:13.711
I had polio when I was three.

15:13.711 --> 15:15.151
Don't breathe too
well on my own.

15:15.151 --> 15:16.431
Is that why
you're here today?

15:16.431 --> 15:18.071
Uh, no - fever,
abdominal pain,

15:18.071 --> 15:20.271
possible appendicitis.

15:20.271 --> 15:22.071
I'm a retired RN.

15:22.071 --> 15:23.631
I need to get a BP.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.391
Yeah, and I'm gonna need
to examine his belly.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.071
There are portholes
on the side.

15:27.071 --> 15:29.311
Just stick your arms through
the neoprene.

15:29.311 --> 15:30.591
All right.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.071
Hmm.

15:34.071 --> 15:36.471
Are you, er,
in this all the time?

15:36.471 --> 15:39.591
We have three kids,
so no, not all the time.

15:40.431 --> 15:41.831
I use it 18 hours a day.

15:41.831 --> 15:43.031
How long have you
guys been together?

15:43.031 --> 15:44.151
45 years.

15:48.911 --> 15:50.551
I got an e-mail from Yale.

15:50.551 --> 15:52.111
They want another two
letters of recommendation.

15:52.111 --> 15:53.471
Well, that seems
a bit pointless

15:53.471 --> 15:55.271
if Dubenko can offer you
a position here.

15:55.271 --> 15:57.431
I'm not sure he thinks
I'm right for the job.

15:57.431 --> 15:59.791
Oh, man.
That's the head CT.

16:00.991 --> 16:03.191
This must be
the lung mass.

16:03.191 --> 16:05.030
Yikes. Where's
the patient?

16:05.030 --> 16:06.470
LFTs and CBC.

16:06.470 --> 16:08.790
Looks like the horse
is out of the barn.

16:08.790 --> 16:10.870
Mm. Son's at bedside.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.270
No dad.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.790
Donna, this is Dr Rasgotra,
Dr Dubenko.

16:16.790 --> 16:17.950
Her son.
Dylan, hello.

16:17.950 --> 16:19.310
Hi. Nice to meet you.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.830
Um, I've reviewed the films,
and I'm sorry to say

16:21.830 --> 16:24.550
that the tumour is
far too advanced for surgery.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.950
Are you sure?
With cancer in the liver,

16:26.950 --> 16:28.430
the brain and bones,

16:28.430 --> 16:29.790
I'm afraid
that an operation

16:29.790 --> 16:31.590
would only mean
pain and suffering

16:31.590 --> 16:33.030
without prolonging
your life.

16:34.510 --> 16:36.110
It's in my bones?

16:36.110 --> 16:37.590
We think so.

16:37.590 --> 16:39.110
What about
chemotherapy?

16:39.110 --> 16:40.430
It's possible, but...

16:40.430 --> 16:43.030
We'll see what the,
er, oncologists say.

16:47.150 --> 16:48.950
Have you thought about
your wishes for life support?

16:48.950 --> 16:51.590
Perhaps this is better
discussed later.

16:51.590 --> 16:53.550
I made a living will
about ten years ago.

16:53.550 --> 16:54.990
I don't want to be kept alive

16:54.990 --> 16:56.470
if I have a terminal illness.
Mom...

16:56.470 --> 16:57.950
Then you might want
to explore the hospices...

16:57.950 --> 16:59.190
OK, we-we don't
need to talk...

16:59.190 --> 17:01.670
What's a hospice?
What is that?

17:01.670 --> 17:03.150
It's a way to keep people
comfortable

17:03.150 --> 17:04.710
in the final stages
of their illness.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.390
Are you saying that...?

17:06.390 --> 17:08.069
Look, um, we're gonna
come back, um,

17:08.069 --> 17:10.869
after you've had a little bit
more time to consider.

17:10.869 --> 17:12.829
Yeah.
OK.

17:12.829 --> 17:14.190
Doctors?

17:16.430 --> 17:17.589
What are you doing?

17:17.589 --> 17:18.910
What?

17:18.910 --> 17:21.109
I asked for a surgical opinion,
not for the Grim Reaper.

17:21.109 --> 17:22.550
I was being truthful.

17:22.550 --> 17:25.190
They have barely processed
the cancer diagnosis and
you walk in there...

17:25.190 --> 17:26.750
What, do you want me
to sugar-coat it?
You want me to lie?

17:26.750 --> 17:28.870
No, I want you to give them
a little bit of hope.

17:28.870 --> 17:30.990
Well, maybe there is something
positive to offer - a thoracentesis?

17:30.990 --> 17:32.990
Yes, that's a good idea.
That should make her feel a better.

17:32.990 --> 17:34.790
Good. Well, why don't
we lead with...?

17:39.550 --> 17:41.709
Frank said you guys have
fresh coffee.

17:41.709 --> 17:43.869
I hope you have
half-and-half.

17:45.429 --> 17:46.509
OK...

17:46.509 --> 17:49.149
I'll just just make
a...fresh pot.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.269
Oh, OK.

17:52.269 --> 17:54.309
Hi, I'm Kelly.

17:54.309 --> 17:55.989
Hi, I'm Dr Gates.

17:55.989 --> 17:57.549
Oh. What kind
of doctor are you?

17:57.549 --> 18:00.669
Well, this is an ER, so...

18:00.669 --> 18:02.549
That must be
complicated.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.469
You got to know a lot of
stuff about everything.

18:05.469 --> 18:06.989
How long you
worked here?

18:06.989 --> 18:08.829
A couple years.
Cool.

18:08.829 --> 18:10.709
Yeah, I've only been
in town for two nights

18:10.709 --> 18:13.749
and I'm craving
deep-dish pizza.

18:13.749 --> 18:15.509
Oh, Lou Malnati's.

18:15.509 --> 18:16.589
Oh, yeah?

18:16.589 --> 18:17.749
Yeah, that
sounds great.

18:20.069 --> 18:21.949
What are you doing
for dinner?

18:24.229 --> 18:26.189
I don't think that would
be such a good idea.

18:26.189 --> 18:27.909
Why not?

18:27.909 --> 18:29.509
I just got out
of a relationship.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.869
Oh.

18:30.869 --> 18:32.949
When you fall off a bike,
you get right back on it.

18:32.949 --> 18:36.029
Got a sesame seed...

18:37.469 --> 18:38.949
Kelly?

18:38.949 --> 18:40.829
Sammy.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.549
(GASPING) Wha...?

18:42.549 --> 18:44.789
What are you...?
Oh, my God!

18:44.789 --> 18:46.229
Hi.
What are you...?

18:46.229 --> 18:49.069
Oh, my God,
l-look, look at you.

18:49.069 --> 18:50.669
Look at you. Hi.

18:50.669 --> 18:53.709
I'm really sorry
to barge in on you at work.

18:53.709 --> 18:56.269
You know,
I got your message,

18:56.269 --> 18:57.829
but I've been busy
at work and...

18:57.829 --> 18:59.069
That's fine.

18:59.069 --> 19:00.629
So, how do you two know
each other?

19:00.629 --> 19:02.989
Uh, Tony,
this is my sister, Kelly.

19:04.149 --> 19:06.669
(CHUCKLES)

19:09.389 --> 19:11.429
If I can tie up a few loose ends,
I could take a break.

19:11.429 --> 19:13.869
I'll be fine - just, you know,
me and the Home Shopping Network.

19:13.869 --> 19:16.948
Ortho's on line four
and they need you at the lung tap.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.468
Go save some lives.

19:18.468 --> 19:20.228
Stay out of trouble.

19:20.228 --> 19:21.908
That's your sister, huh?

19:21.908 --> 19:24.148
She seems very nice.
Yeah.

19:24.148 --> 19:25.988
(GATES) Ortho?

19:25.988 --> 19:27.988
Sam, cytology
and culture on this.

19:27.988 --> 19:29.588
(RASGOTRA) Take a deep breath.

19:29.588 --> 19:31.388
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

19:31.388 --> 19:32.988
Much easier.

19:32.988 --> 19:34.748
Good. We can pull
three litres.

19:34.748 --> 19:35.948
Dylan, it's late,
you should go.

19:35.948 --> 19:38.148
I'm not going.

19:38.148 --> 19:40.628
He has an audition today for the
Juilliard School in New York.

19:40.628 --> 19:42.148
Impressive.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.388
What instrument?

19:43.388 --> 19:44.788
English horn.

19:44.788 --> 19:45.988
I used to play
the viola.

19:45.988 --> 19:47.068
The English horn
is lovely.

19:47.068 --> 19:48.508
Honey, they're only here
once a year.

19:48.508 --> 19:49.588
You might never get
another shot.

19:49.588 --> 19:50.668
I'm much better.

19:50.668 --> 19:53.628
You think it's OK
if he goes?

19:53.628 --> 19:54.668
Yeah, I don't see
why not.

19:54.668 --> 19:56.028
(DUBENKO) I think it'd
be best to stay.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.628
With the extent of your disease,

19:57.628 --> 19:59.668
things could suddenly take
a turn for the worse.

20:00.708 --> 20:03.228
You mean
that could happen today?

20:03.228 --> 20:05.228
That's pretty unlikely.

20:05.228 --> 20:06.548
Yeah, I should,
I should stay.

20:06.548 --> 20:09.108
Dylan...
Mom, I'm staying.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.388
Let's wait a bit
and see how she's doing, OK?

20:14.308 --> 20:15.708
Sam, you seen the old guy?

20:15.708 --> 20:16.948
Not in a while.

20:16.948 --> 20:18.268
Oxygen's off,
so are the monitors.

20:18.268 --> 20:19.588
Looks like he eloped.

20:19.588 --> 20:20.748
Great.
What happened?

20:20.748 --> 20:22.508
I think we lost a patient.

20:22.508 --> 20:23.788
Check the bathroom.

20:23.788 --> 20:25.748
(DUBENKO) Sam, we can see
your polio guy now.

20:25.748 --> 20:27.188
I'm gonna need you
on a paramedic run.

20:27.188 --> 20:29.108
Hey, Frank, tell my sister
it's gonna be a while.

20:29.108 --> 20:30.508
I got to find
a demented grandpa,

20:30.508 --> 20:31.828
pick up
an incoming off a rig

20:31.828 --> 20:33.508
and pull a patient
out of an iron lung.

20:45.108 --> 20:47.748
(ZADRO) April Robinson, syncopal
episode at Walgreen's, still altered.

20:47.748 --> 20:49.588
(MORRIS) Any seizure activity?

20:49.588 --> 20:51.628
No.
What's up
with the handcuffs?

20:51.628 --> 20:54.227
She passed out after getting
busted for shoplifting.

20:54.227 --> 20:55.547
(MORRIS) How convenient.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.467
(ZADRO) No, she's real -
blood sugar's over 400.

20:57.467 --> 20:58.987
12 lead EKG negative for MI.

20:58.987 --> 21:01.187
I gave a litre of saline and got her
sats up with suctioning.

21:01.187 --> 21:02.387
What do we have?

21:02.387 --> 21:03.947
(ZADRO) This lady fainted
at Woolworth's!

21:03.947 --> 21:05.427
Any heart history?
You got me.

21:05.427 --> 21:06.667
She doesn't have a pulse.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.347
When did she
stop breathing?

21:08.347 --> 21:10.547
(ZADRO) Doc, they pay me to drive
them to the hospital, that's it.

21:10.547 --> 21:11.867
She's lucky I had
an oxygen tank.

21:11.867 --> 21:13.067
She needs a cardiac
arrest cart.

21:13.067 --> 21:14.187
(MORRIS) It may be
too late for that.

21:21.787 --> 21:24.627
(RASGOTRA) Dilated appendix,
non-compressible.

21:24.627 --> 21:25.707
So I'll need surgery?

21:25.707 --> 21:27.107
Yes, most definitely.

21:27.107 --> 21:28.787
Can it be done
with the laparoscope?

21:28.787 --> 21:29.867
We'll try.

21:29.867 --> 21:30.987
Sometimes, though,
we have to convert

21:30.987 --> 21:32.347
to a conventional procedure.

21:32.347 --> 21:35.187
(DAMIEN) You mean
opening up my belly?

21:35.187 --> 21:38.467
I use my abdominal muscles
to help me breathe.

21:38.467 --> 21:40.667
His friend had colon surgery
and ended up traked for life.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.987
All right, well,
we'll do the best we can.

21:42.987 --> 21:44.947
Dr Rasgotra will be back
with the consent form.

21:44.947 --> 21:47.547
He's a perfect candidate for NOTES.

21:47.547 --> 21:48.787
What?

21:48.787 --> 21:51.027
Natural Orifice Transluminal
Endoscopic Surgery.

21:51.027 --> 21:53.467
You want to remove his
appendix through his mouth?

21:53.467 --> 21:54.747
Well, in his
compromised state,

21:54.747 --> 21:57.027
he needs the least invasive
procedure, and NOTES is it.

21:57.027 --> 21:58.947
Yeah, we don't do that here.
It's experimental.

21:58.947 --> 22:00.387
But there's a Dr Horta
from San Diego

22:00.387 --> 22:01.627
doing clinical trials
at Northwestern.

22:01.627 --> 22:02.907
He's had over 50 cases.

22:02.907 --> 22:04.507
You're cutting a hole
in his stomach, Neela.

22:04.507 --> 22:05.907
You're setting yourself
up for peritonitis.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.507
It's a two-millimetre
incision that's occluded

22:07.507 --> 22:08.947
by a balloon and transport.

22:08.947 --> 22:10.947
When you're done, you close
immediately with G-prox.

22:10.947 --> 22:12.307
They've had great success.

22:12.307 --> 22:13.667
You want to call
this guy in?

22:13.667 --> 22:15.187
Well, it's a chance
to be state-of-the-art.

22:15.187 --> 22:17.147
See if he's willing to help
and available today.

22:17.147 --> 22:18.627
Long shot.

23:04.826 --> 23:06.186
Easter party food.

23:06.266 --> 23:07.546
There are chicken dips,

23:07.626 --> 23:09.026
duck spring roll dips

23:09.106 --> 23:10.466
and everyone's favourite...

24:35.545 --> 24:37.025
Come on, kids!

24:37.985 --> 24:39.345
Wow!

24:39.425 --> 24:41.425
That was your first bike, remember?

24:43.305 --> 24:46.145
Dirt takes its toll
on things you cherish.

24:46.265 --> 24:49.065
Cif Cream with micro-particles
lifts dirt easily...

24:49.145 --> 24:51.305
Mum! Look at my glasses!

24:51.385 --> 24:53.025

24:53.145 --> 24:54.905
- (giggles)
- Hm.

24:55.865 --> 24:58.025
..and a new lease of life.

24:58.785 --> 25:00.825
It's amazing what comes clean...

25:35.945 --> 25:37.985
They'd have our undivided attention

25:38.105 --> 25:40.385
morning, noon and night
if they could.

25:40.505 --> 25:43.625
But sometimes they have to
entertain themselves for a while.

25:44.385 --> 25:46.744
That's where
Pedigree Jumbone comes in.

25:46.824 --> 25:48.184
Packed with omega-3,

25:48.304 --> 25:50.304

with the meaty centre

25:50.424 --> 25:52.624

get their teeth into.

25:54.944 --> 25:58.104
(Bill Oddie)
At Jordans we think inside the box.

25:58.104 --> 26:01.064
We start
by using nature-friendly oats

26:01.064 --> 26:03.504
from British farmers
we know and trust.

26:03.504 --> 26:04.504
Hello, there!

26:04.504 --> 26:06.704
Then, after 83 different recipes,

26:06.704 --> 26:09.224
Bill and David Jordan
created the perfect

26:09.224 --> 26:11.304
crispy, creamy, crunchy cluster!

26:11.304 --> 26:12.224
(heavenly chorus)

26:12.224 --> 26:13.944
Which we then bake by eye

26:13.944 --> 26:15.784
to make sure you get delicious

26:15.784 --> 26:17.344
golden clusters in every box.

26:17.624 --> 26:18.944
Oh, ow!

26:18.944 --> 26:20.024
Mmmm...!

26:21.464 --> 26:23.384
You can taste we care.

27:27.223 --> 27:28.623
Neela wants me
in Curtain Two.

27:28.623 --> 27:30.503
Drop the insulin to five
an hour before you go.

27:30.503 --> 27:31.783
What's going on here?

27:31.783 --> 27:33.663
Your diabetes is out of control.

27:33.663 --> 27:35.263
Paramedics brought you
to the ER.

27:35.263 --> 27:37.503
Think of it as a pit stop
before jail.

27:37.503 --> 27:39.023
What are you talking about?

27:39.023 --> 27:40.223
Why don't you
take it easy?

27:40.223 --> 27:41.983
Why don't you step out until
she's medically cleared.

27:41.983 --> 27:43.303
I didn't do anything.

27:43.303 --> 27:45.543
Well, surveillance camera shows you
pocketing lipstick and mascara.

27:45.543 --> 27:47.863
I was gonna to pay for that.
I got distracted.

27:47.863 --> 27:49.223
You can't keep me.

27:49.223 --> 27:50.383
My daughter needs me
home with her.

27:50.383 --> 27:52.543
You should of thought about that
before you pinched Maybelline.

27:52.543 --> 27:55.223
Hey, come on, Officer.
Can I ask you a question?

27:55.223 --> 27:56.703
"I was gonna pay for it"!

27:56.703 --> 27:58.023
What a load of crap.

27:58.023 --> 27:59.223
You know,

27:59.223 --> 28:01.183
she doesn't seem like a crook.

28:01.183 --> 28:02.423
Does she have any priors?

28:02.423 --> 28:03.623
Any priors?!

28:03.623 --> 28:05.623
You have been hanging
out with Claudia.

28:05.623 --> 28:07.103
(GATES) Hey, Morris,
we found him.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.343
Excuse me.

28:08.343 --> 28:09.663
Outside, barely conscious.

28:09.663 --> 28:11.463
Pulse ox 78 on room air.

28:11.463 --> 28:13.303
Probably blossoming some
pulmonary contusions
from the trauma.

28:13.303 --> 28:15.943
All right.
Open an airway tray at 8-0.

28:15.943 --> 28:18.023
Where's Sam?
(MORRIS) On her way.

28:18.023 --> 28:19.223
Are we really
gonna do this?

28:19.223 --> 28:20.783
Yeah.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.263
This guy could be sharp
as a tack once his sodium's normal.

28:22.263 --> 28:23.463
What do you need?

28:23.463 --> 28:25.143
Sublingual captopril,
four of morphine.

28:25.143 --> 28:26.863
Hey, Sammy,

28:26.863 --> 28:28.703
I've been here
for, like, two hours.

28:28.703 --> 28:30.063
It's kind of a bad time.

28:30.063 --> 28:31.543
I know. I just... I can't
really wait around.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.583
I've got a bunch
of appointments.

28:32.583 --> 28:33.903
Ma'am, can you just let us...?

28:33.903 --> 28:35.143
(GATES) Has everyone
met Sam's sister?

28:35.143 --> 28:36.663
(MORRIS) I didn't know
You had a sister.

28:36.663 --> 28:37.703
Hello.

28:37.703 --> 28:38.943
Hi.

28:38.943 --> 28:41.183
Sam, take a break.
Chuny'll take over.

28:41.183 --> 28:42.623
Yeah, you know, looks
like you could use one.

28:45.063 --> 28:48.143
Hey, Doc,
we busted the mugger.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.823
I got an empty wallet...

28:49.823 --> 28:52.143
and a retirement
watch from County.

28:52.143 --> 28:53.583
Maybe he worked here.

28:53.583 --> 28:56.023
Suction on high.
Call for a vent!

28:56.023 --> 28:58.303
(GATES) End tidal CO2 detector.

28:58.303 --> 29:00.182
(TAGGART) 'You look good.'

29:00.182 --> 29:02.342
I mean, considering
the last time I saw you,

29:02.342 --> 29:03.622
we were both in pigtails.

29:03.622 --> 29:06.142
Yeah... Yeah, it's been
a really long time.

29:06.142 --> 29:09.582
Mm.
We got some catching up.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.662
You want to go to dinner?
I get off at eight.

29:11.662 --> 29:14.502
Uh, no, you know,
my flight's at 7.30

29:14.502 --> 29:17.062
and I've got my last
meeting at five.

29:17.062 --> 29:18.422
What kind of meetings?

29:18.422 --> 29:21.222
Uh, well, I'm here
for the apparel show.

29:21.222 --> 29:23.742
Oh, my God! I remember those
dresses you used to make

29:23.742 --> 29:25.222
for your Cabbage Patch Kids!

29:25.222 --> 29:28.342
Oh, my... You actually turned
that into a job?!

29:28.342 --> 29:29.542
Yeah.

29:29.542 --> 29:33.302
Uh, my clothing line
just got bought by Billabong

29:33.302 --> 29:35.342
for about $2 million.

29:35.342 --> 29:36.782
You're kidding.

29:36.782 --> 29:38.662
No.
You're kidding me.

29:38.662 --> 29:41.102
Yeah, it's, er...

29:41.102 --> 29:43.982
Well, I've got to travel
to Europe and Japan

29:43.982 --> 29:45.302
to launch
the new collection.

29:45.302 --> 29:47.742
Wow!

29:47.742 --> 29:49.462
Wow. What, did you just come

29:49.462 --> 29:51.822
all the way from Dallas
to rub it in my face?

29:51.822 --> 29:57.862
No... No, um, I came
to talk about Mom.

29:59.702 --> 30:02.982
I had to move her
to assisted living.

30:02.982 --> 30:06.302
You know,
her emphysema got worse.

30:06.302 --> 30:08.062
Yeah, well, three packs
a day'll do that.

30:08.062 --> 30:09.222
She also had a stroke.

30:09.222 --> 30:11.862
(SIGHS)

30:11.862 --> 30:15.102
You know, I visit her,
like, twice a week.

30:15.102 --> 30:18.182
And it's not a lot,
but it makes her happy.

30:18.182 --> 30:19.542
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

30:19.542 --> 30:22.582
And I'm going to be travelling
for months at a time, so...

30:22.582 --> 30:26.502
You know, I... I want
to move her to Chicago.

30:26.502 --> 30:28.582
No, don't.
Please don't.

30:28.582 --> 30:29.782
Look, I'll pay
for everything -

30:29.782 --> 30:31.342
her moving expenses,
her living expenses.

30:31.342 --> 30:34.342
All you've got to do
is just go visit her.

30:34.342 --> 30:36.982
Look, I've been doing this
for a really long time now, OK?

30:36.982 --> 30:38.381
I think it's your turn.

30:38.381 --> 30:39.501
No, it's not.

30:39.501 --> 30:41.061
Look, she's your mother.

30:41.061 --> 30:44.101
You know, even after everything,
she's still your mother.

30:44.101 --> 30:46.741
Who I haven't spoken to
since I was 15.

30:48.741 --> 30:51.741
Well, you know, maybe it's time
that changed, too.

30:54.501 --> 30:56.621
All right, I'm in. Bag him.

30:56.621 --> 30:58.781
AC 14, tidal volume 500.

30:58.781 --> 31:00.381
Have Frank check
personnel records,

31:00.381 --> 31:02.181
see if we can figure out
who he is.

31:02.181 --> 31:03.581
(RASGOTRA)
Post-expansion pulmonary edema.

31:03.581 --> 31:05.821
Let's get her son
back over here now.

31:05.821 --> 31:07.061
He went to his audition.

31:07.061 --> 31:09.141
I thought he was gonna stay.
I told him he could go.

31:09.141 --> 31:11.181
How soon can he get back?
I don't know.

31:11.181 --> 31:14.181
We need bipap and set up
for an intubation.

31:14.181 --> 31:15.621
Intubation?
She has a living will,

31:15.621 --> 31:17.101
she asked for no heroic measures.

31:17.101 --> 31:20.221
OK, Donna, Donna, I need
to ask you a question.

31:20.221 --> 31:22.101
Donna? Donna?!

31:22.101 --> 31:24.421
I should call her son.
Exactly what
I didn't want to have happen.

31:24.421 --> 31:26.821
OK, start with the bipap.

31:26.821 --> 31:28.301
It's non-invasive,
in the spirit of her wishes.

31:28.301 --> 31:29.501
That's a good idea.

31:29.501 --> 31:30.901
This isn't a surgical
problem, Dr Brenner.

31:30.901 --> 31:34.421
You're the primary physician
on the case, so you call it.

31:34.421 --> 31:35.621
Let's go, Neela.

31:46.181 --> 31:47.541
Did you reach the son?

31:47.541 --> 31:49.341
No. I might have to intubate.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.581
With a DNR?
Can you even do that?

31:51.581 --> 31:52.941
Well, temporarily.

31:52.941 --> 31:54.981
I can always remove it later.

31:54.981 --> 31:58.301
I promised her son that she
would be alive when he got back.

31:58.301 --> 31:59.581
I see.

31:59.581 --> 32:01.341
(BRENNER) There's fluid
around the heart.

32:01.341 --> 32:02.861
We can drain that,
buy her some time.

32:02.861 --> 32:04.381
(FRANK) Neela.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.941
Dr Horta's here
on your porta-lung appy.

32:05.941 --> 32:07.541
Peri-vac kit and betadine.

32:07.541 --> 32:09.541
Well, um, good luck.

32:09.541 --> 32:11.581
(TAGGART)
'Serum ketones are negative.'

32:11.581 --> 32:12.701
Is that a problem?

32:12.701 --> 32:14.021
(MORRIS) Well, medically,
it's good news.

32:14.021 --> 32:15.581
But it means we have no reason

32:15.581 --> 32:17.100
to keep you
in the hospital overnight.

32:18.420 --> 32:20.380
So I'm going to jail?

32:20.380 --> 32:21.980
I think they let you out
if you pay a fine.

32:21.980 --> 32:23.900
I don't have the money.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.620
What about a loan?

32:25.620 --> 32:29.300
They won't give you credit
if you don't have a job.

32:29.300 --> 32:33.100
Ever since I got laid off,
I've been cleaning houses.

32:33.100 --> 32:35.980
Barely covers the rent.

32:35.980 --> 32:37.620
My daughter.

32:37.620 --> 32:38.820
Your daughter...?

32:38.820 --> 32:40.460
Pregnant.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.460
On bed rest.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.340
I'm trying to buy her
a crib and stuff.

32:45.340 --> 32:47.540
You talk to a social worker
about getting some help.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.940
I have worked hard
my whole life.

32:51.940 --> 32:53.900
I've raised two babies.

32:53.900 --> 32:55.700
Never been on welfare.

32:55.700 --> 32:58.020
I had to get my medicine.

32:58.020 --> 32:59.900
So why would you...

32:59.900 --> 33:01.460
Steal a tube of lipstick?

33:04.900 --> 33:07.740
I return it for store credit.

33:09.180 --> 33:11.060
Use the credit...

33:11.060 --> 33:13.420
to buy my insulin.

33:14.780 --> 33:16.820
It works.

33:18.260 --> 33:19.740
Dr Morris.

33:19.740 --> 33:23.020
We're making some progress
ID'ing your old guy.

33:29.460 --> 33:32.460
There's a patient missing
from a nursing home on Dearborn.

33:32.460 --> 33:34.180
Fits his age and description.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.740
You hear that, Oliver?

33:35.740 --> 33:38.420
Sounds like we found
out where you belong.

33:38.420 --> 33:40.380
Systolic's down to 80.
Run in a litre.

33:40.380 --> 33:43.940
(GATES) You need a hand?
I just need to thread the
catheter over the guide wire.

33:49.500 --> 33:52.020
There's the pericardial fluid.

33:52.020 --> 33:53.820
It should help.

33:53.820 --> 33:56.099
I'll check another
blood pressure, Doctor?

34:05.259 --> 34:06.699
(SLAPPING RAIL)

34:06.699 --> 34:08.139
What's wrong?

34:08.139 --> 34:09.978
What do you need? You in pain?

34:09.978 --> 34:11.699
Relax.

34:11.699 --> 34:12.779
You're OK.

34:12.779 --> 34:14.539
Hit him with
some Versed, Tony.

34:23.179 --> 34:24.978
(GATES) "TB".

34:24.978 --> 34:27.379
TB?!

34:29.379 --> 34:32.219
By any chance,
does your lady have tuberculosis?

34:32.219 --> 34:33.539
No, she's got cancer.

34:33.539 --> 34:36.699
You sure? Do you have confirmation
on the path report?

34:36.699 --> 34:38.899
It'd be unusual,

34:38.899 --> 34:40.659
but...TB could explain everything.

34:40.659 --> 34:42.018
Infection in the lung,

34:42.018 --> 34:44.458
the bone, liver, the brain,
around the heart.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.619
You need a sputum
stain for AFB.

34:46.619 --> 34:48.379
(MARQUEZ) Better get a mask on her.

34:48.379 --> 34:50.179
You think your guy was a doctor?

34:50.179 --> 34:51.418
Oliver,

34:51.418 --> 34:52.938
were you a doctor?

34:55.059 --> 34:56.219
I'm sorry, I wouldn't have

34:56.219 --> 34:57.619
pulled you out
if it wasn't important.

34:57.619 --> 35:01.099
Real quick -
what's the fine for shoplifting?

35:01.099 --> 35:03.179
And the maximum jail time?

35:03.179 --> 35:04.619
(SIGHS)

35:04.619 --> 35:06.739
No, the guys
didn't put me up to this.

35:06.739 --> 35:09.579
Thank you. Get back to class.

35:09.579 --> 35:11.699
You don't look like
you have good news.

35:11.699 --> 35:13.779
Could be up to six months.
(GROANS)

35:13.779 --> 35:15.579
You know, all the jails
are overcrowded.

35:15.579 --> 35:18.539
It won't be that long.
No, her daughter's having
her baby next week!

35:18.539 --> 35:19.899
Hey, Morris.

35:19.899 --> 35:22.179
OK, I will be back
as soon as I can.

35:22.179 --> 35:23.739
Excuse me.
My captain wanted to know

35:23.739 --> 35:25.379
how much longer
she's gonna be.

35:25.379 --> 35:27.419
Uh...this needs
to run in over an hour.

35:27.419 --> 35:28.859
I thought
she was ready.

35:28.859 --> 35:30.979
Yeah, if I discharge her too
soon, she'll bounce right back.

35:30.979 --> 35:32.219
I got to call the station.

35:32.219 --> 35:33.698
You know what sucks?

35:33.698 --> 35:36.058
There are guys out there
stealing cars and shooting guns,

35:36.058 --> 35:38.258
and you're here all day
baby-sitting a decent lady.

35:38.258 --> 35:39.458
I'm just doing my job.

35:42.218 --> 35:44.098
Where's Brenner?

35:44.098 --> 35:46.698
He ran to the lab.
We think this lady has TB.

35:46.698 --> 35:48.458
Yeah, and this guy
might have figured it out.

35:48.458 --> 35:49.538
Really?

35:49.538 --> 35:51.738
How long does
an AFB stain take?

35:51.738 --> 35:53.138
Less than an hour.

35:53.138 --> 35:57.578
(MORRIS) "To OMK.
35 years of service."

36:00.178 --> 36:01.898
Oh, my God.

36:01.898 --> 36:03.498
Do you know who this is?

36:03.498 --> 36:06.338
Yeah, this is...
this is Dr Oliver Kostin.

36:06.338 --> 36:07.978
As in Kostin's

36:07.978 --> 36:09.178
Textbook Of
Emergency Medicine.

36:09.178 --> 36:12.138
He's a legend.

36:12.138 --> 36:13.738
Dr Morgenstern!

36:13.738 --> 36:15.138
The one and only.

36:15.138 --> 36:17.058
Hey, Chuny.
So good to see you.

36:17.058 --> 36:18.578
So good to see you.

36:18.578 --> 36:21.018
This is Dr Morris
and Dr Gates.
Hi.

36:21.018 --> 36:24.018
Dr Morgenstern
ran this place back in the day.

36:24.018 --> 36:25.378
What are you
doing here?

36:25.378 --> 36:27.818
I got a call from
the nursing home - Ollie...

36:27.818 --> 36:29.738
you gotta stop
wandering.

36:29.738 --> 36:32.498
Are you his doctor?
No. His proxy.

36:32.498 --> 36:34.618
His wife died a few years ago.

36:34.618 --> 36:36.578
They never had
any children, so I got

36:36.578 --> 36:38.498
a durable power of attorney
for health care.

36:38.498 --> 36:42.538
You must have been close.
He taught me everything.

36:42.538 --> 36:45.138
Treated me like a son.

36:45.138 --> 36:46.698
He knows you're here.

36:46.698 --> 36:48.338
Then he's having a good day.

36:48.338 --> 36:50.538
What's his baseline?

36:50.538 --> 36:53.778
Multi-infarct dementia,
and going downhill fast.

36:53.778 --> 36:57.498
Ooh...he had
a great mind.

36:57.498 --> 36:59.858
Now there's nothing left.

36:59.858 --> 37:01.698
Well, something's
going on in there.

37:01.698 --> 37:03.538
He thinks that lady
has tuberculosis.

37:03.538 --> 37:04.938
(CHUCKLES)

37:06.018 --> 37:07.378
Does she?

37:08.738 --> 37:10.618
(MARQUEZ) We don't know yet.

37:10.618 --> 37:12.377
The... The swelling

37:12.377 --> 37:14.577
behind the right ear.

37:14.577 --> 37:16.377
Could be scrofula.

37:16.377 --> 37:18.177
It's a TB-infected
lymph node.

37:18.177 --> 37:20.737
Used to be in the textbooks -
it's not any more.

37:20.737 --> 37:23.217
So if he's right,
he's still capable...

37:23.217 --> 37:24.417
No.

37:24.417 --> 37:27.217
It's a flash of an old memory.

37:27.217 --> 37:28.697
Every once in a while,
a stimulus -

37:28.697 --> 37:31.137
a sight or a sound - brings up
something from the past,

37:31.137 --> 37:33.057
but it doesn't last long.

37:33.057 --> 37:34.737
For all intents
and purposes,

37:34.737 --> 37:36.697
he doesn't interact
with the present.

37:36.697 --> 37:39.297
He hardly speaks.

37:39.297 --> 37:41.897
I brought a copy
of his DNR order.

37:41.897 --> 37:43.697
So we shouldn't
have tubed him?

37:44.857 --> 37:47.337
He never wanted
to end up like this.

37:47.337 --> 37:49.017
Could we take him
off the vent?

37:49.017 --> 37:51.137
Maybe...move him
into a private room?

37:51.137 --> 37:54.217
Sure.
What about Trauma One?

37:54.217 --> 37:56.977
He might be getting
a few visitors.

37:56.977 --> 37:58.897
You know, the ER

37:58.897 --> 38:00.777
used to end right here.

38:00.777 --> 38:04.377
He designed your trauma rooms.

38:04.377 --> 38:06.537
And got 'em built 40 years ago.

38:07.777 --> 38:09.297
Dr Horta cleared
his entire schedule

38:09.297 --> 38:11.057
to come operate on you.
Thanks, Doc.

38:11.057 --> 38:12.777
My pleasure.
We'll see you upstairs.

38:12.777 --> 38:15.697
I'll be right
behind you, honey.

38:15.697 --> 38:18.217
I'm...really looking
forward to this.

38:18.217 --> 38:20.537
It's gonna blow your mind.

38:20.537 --> 38:21.777
Oh, Lucien.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.577
This is Dr Horta
from San Diego.

38:23.577 --> 38:25.617
Oh, um, hi.
Yeah, I've all about you.

38:25.617 --> 38:27.457
So, um, this thing's
really gonna happen?

38:27.457 --> 38:29.937
We're all set to go.
You should scrub in.

38:29.937 --> 38:32.657
I can't. I've got a couple of
cases, pre-op cases, to check in on.

38:32.657 --> 38:35.137
Let the residents do it.
Go ahead. I'll be in and out,

38:35.137 --> 38:36.977
you guys.
Let's take the stairs.

38:36.977 --> 38:38.377
OK.
Nice to meet you.

38:38.377 --> 38:39.537
Yeah.

38:39.537 --> 38:41.417
Lucien, heard about
the NOTES appy.

38:41.417 --> 38:43.777
Pretty cool.
Yeah, it is...pretty cool.

38:43.777 --> 38:45.217
Excuse me, Officer.

38:46.777 --> 38:48.417
when they're sending you
off to jail?

38:48.417 --> 38:50.136
You need to be
on bed rest.

38:50.136 --> 38:52.376
This is crazy, Mom.
This isn't you.

38:52.376 --> 38:53.576
Dr Morris,

38:53.576 --> 38:54.656
this is April's
daughter, Kendra.

38:54.656 --> 38:56.496
Hello.
Hello. Is she OK now?

38:56.496 --> 38:58.536
Her diabetes is
back under control.

38:58.536 --> 39:01.856
Mom! Why would you do
something like this?

39:01.856 --> 39:04.136
I don't know.
I guess I wasn't thinking.

39:04.136 --> 39:06.136
Your mother was trying to help.
This is between

39:06.136 --> 39:08.856
her and me, thank you.
Mom, talk to me.

39:08.856 --> 39:10.416
BP's way up - 170/100.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.656
We should let her rest.

39:11.656 --> 39:13.216
Yeah, I think
you're upsetting her.

39:13.216 --> 39:15.016
What do you think
she's doing to me?

39:15.016 --> 39:16.776
Sam, cycle the dinamap.

39:16.776 --> 39:18.456
Ow! (GASPS)

39:18.456 --> 39:19.936
Is that a contraction?

39:19.936 --> 39:22.616
Kyle, grab a gurney,
let's get her up to OB.

39:22.616 --> 39:24.496
No problem.
Slow, deep breaths.

39:24.496 --> 39:26.256
I'm OK.
I don't need all that.

39:26.256 --> 39:27.936
No, we have to
monitor your baby.

39:27.936 --> 39:29.856
Morris, positive AFB.

39:29.856 --> 39:31.016
Whoa!

39:31.016 --> 39:32.976
Well, the whole
ER's been exposed.

39:32.976 --> 39:34.576
Everybody needs
testing and follow-up.

39:34.576 --> 39:36.296
We all assumed
it was a tumour,

39:36.296 --> 39:38.016
but the other hospital
cytology was equivocal.

39:38.016 --> 39:39.296
Chuny, we're intubating.

39:39.296 --> 39:40.416
You are?

39:40.416 --> 39:41.696
Positive TB stain.

39:41.696 --> 39:44.296
She doesn't have cancer,
she has a treatable infection.

39:44.296 --> 39:46.136
(MARQUEZ) All right.
Glide-scope's ready.

39:46.136 --> 39:47.736
Good call, Oliver.

39:47.736 --> 39:49.256
TB is the great imitator.

39:49.256 --> 39:50.696
That's what he taught us.

39:50.696 --> 39:53.496
(BRENNER) 20 of etomidate,
100 of succinyl choline.

39:53.496 --> 39:56.376
(MAN) 'Dr Kostin...
Dr Kostin, are you mad?'

39:56.376 --> 39:58.536
You can't give succinyl
choline down here.

39:58.536 --> 40:00.056
I just did.

40:00.056 --> 40:02.576
Paralytics and intubation
require an anaesthesiologist.

40:02.576 --> 40:04.216
I'll keep that in mind.

40:04.216 --> 40:06.736
Your patient's too sick
for the emergency ward.

40:06.736 --> 40:10.376
Patients like this die

40:10.376 --> 40:12.896
up to the ICU
without an airway.

40:12.896 --> 40:14.936
OK, gentlemen.

40:14.936 --> 40:16.616
My work is done.

40:20.976 --> 40:24.096
(BRENNER) Beautiful shot
of the cords.

40:24.096 --> 40:26.735
Passing the tube.

40:26.735 --> 40:27.975
Nice.

40:27.975 --> 40:29.495
Sats are fine.

40:29.495 --> 40:30.895
(MORRIS) Cuff is down.

40:30.895 --> 40:31.935
All right.

40:31.935 --> 40:33.775
Deep breath in, Oliver.

40:33.775 --> 40:35.055
(INHALES)

40:35.055 --> 40:37.455
And out.

40:37.455 --> 40:39.455

40:41.455 --> 40:42.495
David.

40:49.495 --> 40:52.135
Where do we start rounds?

40:52.135 --> 40:54.335
Right here, Ollie.

40:55.815 --> 40:57.975
You're right
where you need to be.

or leg of lamb,

42:28.574 --> 42:32.054
plump blueberries, raspberries
and sun-ripened cherries

42:32.134 --> 42:34.294
in a jelly terrine,

42:34.374 --> 42:36.734

42:41.214 --> 42:44.214
A very happy Easter from your M&S.

To give the noodles that delicate
balance of flavours and zinginess,

42:48.774 --> 42:50.774
we have to pick
just the right chillies...

43:46.413 --> 43:48.373
Whatever you grow
your plants in,

43:48.453 --> 43:50.453
you need Moisture Control compost

43:50.533 --> 43:51.933
from Miracle-Gro.

43:52.013 --> 43:53.653
It stores water and releases it

43:53.733 --> 43:55.573
as plants need it.

43:55.693 --> 43:57.853
And because it's full of
Miracle-Gro plant food,

43:57.933 --> 43:59.813
plants grow twice as big.

I have to get back.

45:47.212 --> 45:49.572
But I'm really glad
you got in touch.

45:49.572 --> 45:51.172
Yeah.

45:51.172 --> 45:52.692
Yeah, you know, I've...

45:52.692 --> 45:54.652
been trying for 15 years.

45:54.652 --> 45:59.092
Hasn't been easy.

45:59.092 --> 46:01.092
and then the next day,
you took off,

46:01.092 --> 46:02.812
just pregnant by some dude.

46:02.812 --> 46:05.252
I didn't take off.
Mom kicked me out of the house.

46:05.252 --> 46:07.292
Well, you could have called.

46:07.292 --> 46:09.372
She wouldn't let me talk to you.
Written a letter.

46:10.412 --> 46:13.012
I did.

46:13.012 --> 46:15.332
She must have tore them up.

46:15.332 --> 46:17.532
I... I... I never knew that.

46:17.532 --> 46:19.812
I had a baby. I had to work.

46:19.812 --> 46:22.132
After a while,
I just stopped trying.

46:22.132 --> 46:24.372
I figured you probably hated me.

46:25.412 --> 46:26.692
I didn't.

46:29.092 --> 46:31.692
(WRY CHUCKLE) Um...you know,

46:31.692 --> 46:35.572
um, after you left,
this is the only guidance

46:35.572 --> 46:36.812
that I got.

46:36.812 --> 46:38.852
My diary?!
Yeah, yeah,
you must have left

46:38.852 --> 46:42.412
in a hurry, cos I found it
underneath your mattress.
Oh, my God.

46:42.412 --> 46:44.892
Are you kidding me? What?!

46:44.892 --> 46:46.452
Did you read this?
Yeah, of course.

46:46.452 --> 46:47.972
Like 100 times.

46:47.972 --> 46:49.972
You taught me how to...

46:49.972 --> 46:53.372
how to French kiss,
how to pierce my ears,

46:53.372 --> 46:54.732
how to roll a joint.

47:00.571 --> 47:02.451
Six Flags?
Yeah, when I was seven,

47:02.451 --> 47:04.211
that was like the happiest day
of my entire life.

47:04.211 --> 47:05.531
Oh, my God.

47:05.531 --> 47:06.931
Mom took us home early

47:06.931 --> 47:10.131
because you puked your
funnel cake all over Shock Wave.

47:10.131 --> 47:11.851
Ah! you are so wrong.

47:11.851 --> 47:13.731
No, she... (LAUGHS)
..she took us home

47:13.731 --> 47:15.091
because, when she went
to the bathroom,

47:15.091 --> 47:17.651
you went and tried to bum
a cigarette off the hot dog guy.

47:17.651 --> 47:20.051
I did not!
Yes, you did.

47:20.051 --> 47:23.011
Geez...
You were grounded
for an entire week.

47:23.011 --> 47:24.531
Oh!

47:24.531 --> 47:26.691
I was so stupid.

47:33.091 --> 47:35.011
She's really bad, huh?

47:35.011 --> 47:37.531
Yeah, it won't be long.

47:39.491 --> 47:42.251
(FRANK) 'Well, ICU
could take Trauma One.'

47:42.251 --> 47:44.131
OK, let's move Dr Kostin.

47:45.531 --> 47:47.091
Dylan...how'd it go?

47:47.091 --> 47:48.851
It's OK.
Where's my mom at?

47:48.851 --> 47:50.811
She's in a different room
on a breathing machine,

47:50.811 --> 47:54.331
but, um, something
amazing happened.

47:54.331 --> 47:56.811
It turns out your mom
doesn't have cancer.

47:58.771 --> 48:00.091
Are you serious?

48:00.091 --> 48:01.971
It's tuberculosis.

48:02.971 --> 48:04.971
Um, th-they told us tha...

48:04.971 --> 48:06.571
The cells from
the other hospital

48:06.571 --> 48:08.891
were suggestive of cancer,
but they weren't definitive.

48:08.891 --> 48:11.451
So, we ran a special stain

48:11.451 --> 48:13.971
and we found TB.

48:18.971 --> 48:21.051
(VOICE BREAKING) Um, thank you.

48:21.051 --> 48:22.371
Thank you.
That's incredible.

48:22.371 --> 48:26.611
She's not out of the woods yet.
If it's a drug-resistant strain,

48:26.611 --> 48:28.331
then she's gonna have
a very rough course.

48:28.331 --> 48:29.811
But it's better
than cancer, right?

48:29.811 --> 48:31.411
I mean, her prognosis,
it's good?

48:31.411 --> 48:32.771
Now, we're gonna
have to keep you

48:32.771 --> 48:34.331
in isolation for
a couple of days

48:34.331 --> 48:35.930
until we find out
you're not infectious.

48:35.930 --> 48:37.530
Not a problem.

48:37.530 --> 48:39.690
Donna, there's someone
here to see you.

48:40.890 --> 48:43.050
Mom, I heard the great news.

48:46.610 --> 48:48.570
I kind of rocked it.

48:48.570 --> 48:50.690
They're not supposed
to give you any feedback

48:50.690 --> 48:52.490
but the head of the
woodwind department said,

48:52.490 --> 48:53.930
"See you in September."

49:08.250 --> 49:11.570
Sam, I'm going to be
up in the OR for a bit.

49:11.570 --> 49:12.930
Prescription for insulin

49:12.930 --> 49:15.090
and, er, an appointment
with a diabetes clinic.

49:15.090 --> 49:16.730
Where you taking her?

49:16.730 --> 49:19.530
County jail.
Are you OK?

49:19.530 --> 49:21.610
I got some medicine
to stop the contractions.

49:21.610 --> 49:23.570
I have to wait a week
till the baby's ready.

49:23.570 --> 49:25.050
We should be going.
Hold on.

49:25.050 --> 49:28.370
You've got nothing to say?

49:28.370 --> 49:29.770
You're not gonna
explain this to me?

49:31.770 --> 49:33.490
Maybe later.
She's had kind of a rough day.

49:33.490 --> 49:35.330
I thought I was going to have
some help with this baby,

49:35.330 --> 49:36.570
but I'll do it on my own.

49:36.570 --> 49:40.010
I just thought you wanted
to be a part of it.

49:40.010 --> 49:41.890
But if this is how
you want it, fine!

49:41.890 --> 49:43.490
Come here... You know what,
come here.

49:43.490 --> 49:45.570
What are you doing?
Please come with me.

49:45.570 --> 49:49.050
What's going on?
I need you to understand

49:49.050 --> 49:51.250
what your mother
has been doing.

49:51.250 --> 49:52.570
Shoplifting make-up.

49:52.570 --> 49:53.930
To trade for insulin.

49:53.930 --> 49:56.810
She loves you. She's made a lot of
sacrifices for you and your baby.

49:56.810 --> 49:59.090
She almost died today because
she ignored her own health

49:59.090 --> 50:01.010
to buy you a crib.

50:01.010 --> 50:02.730
I didn't know.

50:02.730 --> 50:04.690
Yeah, she's too proud
to say it.

50:04.690 --> 50:07.490
I know it's hard, but try
to appreciate what you have.

50:19.609 --> 50:21.209
Stump is tied off.

50:21.209 --> 50:22.729
Endo-shears.

50:25.049 --> 50:26.929
Nicely done.

50:28.649 --> 50:31.649
Tension as you pull, Neela.

50:31.649 --> 50:33.249
(BRENNER) They're still at it.

50:33.249 --> 50:35.129
Yeah, you're just in time
for the big finish.

50:39.849 --> 50:42.529
(RASGOTRA) Appendix is out.

50:44.409 --> 50:45.769
How cool was that?

50:45.769 --> 50:47.929
(OVER SPEAKER) Very.

50:48.929 --> 50:50.569
(BRENNER) You heard about

50:50.569 --> 50:51.649
the TB case?
Yeah.

50:51.649 --> 50:52.809
(HORTA) G-prox, please.

50:52.809 --> 50:55.689
Yeah, we were all guilty
of "diagnosis momentum".

50:55.689 --> 50:58.409
Despite incomplete evidence,
we heard the word "cancer"

50:58.409 --> 51:00.529
and we all ran
down the wrong path.

51:04.049 --> 51:06.089
It's a glimpse of
the future in there.

51:06.089 --> 51:08.009
Yeah, I wasn't
on board at first,

51:08.009 --> 51:11.249
but Neela persisted, so...

51:11.249 --> 51:13.609
Well, that's a good
quality to have.

51:13.609 --> 51:16.489
Especially in an attending.

51:18.729 --> 51:22.009
There are a lot of candidates
this year, you know.

51:22.009 --> 51:25.009
It's going
to be very competitive.

51:25.009 --> 51:29.169
Well, whoever gets her
will be lucky.

51:33.049 --> 51:34.769
Think he's really mad at me?

51:34.769 --> 51:36.889
Well, it did undermine
his authority.

51:36.889 --> 51:38.849
But it was in the
interest of the patient.

51:38.849 --> 51:40.529
Yeah, I agree.

51:40.529 --> 51:42.489
I think he must
be in Trauma One.

51:42.489 --> 51:44.449
I just hope it doesn't
hurt my chances here.

51:44.449 --> 51:46.809
Well, if it does,
then they're all crazy.

51:46.809 --> 51:49.609
I can't imagine anyone
more brilliant and skilled

51:49.609 --> 51:52.408
and compassionate...
and sexy.

51:53.648 --> 51:55.128
And you'd better take a nap,

51:55.128 --> 51:57.408
because you're going
to need it for later.

51:58.928 --> 52:02.088
I was pre-med,
volunteering at the hospital,

52:02.088 --> 52:03.928
when they made him
chief in '68.

52:03.928 --> 52:07.168
Back then, the ER
was a glorified walk-in clinic

52:07.168 --> 52:09.528
where you were seen
by unsupervised interns

52:09.528 --> 52:10.808
and residents with no training.

52:10.808 --> 52:13.448
And the community ERs
were even worse,

52:13.448 --> 52:17.168
staffed by
moonlighting dermatologists

52:17.168 --> 52:18.888
and psychiatrists, or drunks

52:18.888 --> 52:21.208
who'd been banned
from private practice.

52:21.208 --> 52:24.928
There was no 911...

52:24.928 --> 52:26.408
no paramedics.

52:26.408 --> 52:29.048
And if you needed an ambulance,

52:29.048 --> 52:31.048
you called a funeral home.

52:31.048 --> 52:33.568
(ENGLISH HORN PLAYING SOMBRE MELODY)
What the hell is that?

52:37.768 --> 52:39.728
Hmm.

52:40.768 --> 52:42.928

"than a car crash in Chicago."

52:49.448 --> 52:51.248
But he changed all that.

52:52.288 --> 52:55.208
He developed the 911 system,

52:55.208 --> 52:57.768
he trained
thousands of paramedics,

52:57.768 --> 52:59.888
and started one of the finest

up to the trauma ward!

Someday, we're going to take care
of guys like this down here.

53:57.007 --> 53:58.887
The surgeons will never
sign off on that.
