04:38.445 --> 04:39.488
Here we are.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.534
Alright, check out
the new crib.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.996
Not bad,
now if we were only closer to L.A.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.999
We're only two and a half
hours away, just think Chels'.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.545
No more rent... no more
nosy apartment managers.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.922
No more eviction notices,
I get it.

04:57.756 --> 05:00.384
It was very thoughtful of your
Aunt Evelyn to bequeath it to you.

05:00.884 --> 05:01.927
God rest her soul.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.596
And what I really love
about it.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.517
When my mom comes to visit,
she's going to have her own room.

05:10.185 --> 05:13.522
Um.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.325
So... what do you think?

05:26.243 --> 05:29.663
Well, it could definitely use
a decorators touch.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.000
My only real beef, is the lack of
plumbing in the second bathroom.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.377
Don't worry, we're going to get
that fixed when we have the money.

05:35.627 --> 05:38.297
Remember, like I said
this is just for a year or two.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.425
Until the market picks up, then we'll
flip the house and move back to L.A.

05:41.925 --> 05:45.262
Ya, I just hope we can find
some work in this town.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.889
Don't worry,
everything's going to be okay.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.494
Your lawyer was right about
the cellphone service out here.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.371
Still can't get
a signal?

06:11.455 --> 06:14.833
Only if I stand out in the
street, and turn a certain way.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.585
What's the problem?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.295
I don't know,
he said it might have something to do

06:18.378 --> 06:20.047
with the local power
plant or something.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.799
That sucks, what are we going
to do for phone service?

06:24.301 --> 06:25.594
I guess we just spring
for a landline.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.522
- Hey.
- Hey, what you doing?

06:36.647 --> 06:38.607
- Just updating my resume.
- Ya?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.817
- Yeah.
- Any luck with the back door?

06:41.360 --> 06:43.737
- No it still won't open.
- Mm, okay.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.782
- I'm going to hit the sack.
- Okay I'll be right there, I love you.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.742
Love you... oh.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.912
- What time's our first interview tomorrow?
- Eleven.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.554
Yes hello, you've reached the Tyler
Jantzen and Chelsea Watkins residence.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.097
How may I be of assistance
to you?

07:12.057 --> 07:13.392
Hello.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.320
Really?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.364
Hello?

07:29.741 --> 07:31.702
I'm sorry can you,
can you hear me right now?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.581
I'm going to hang up, okay?

07:38.542 --> 07:39.668
Hello Eric.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.046
I'm sorry,
you've got the wrong number.

07:43.672 --> 07:46.008
Hey, don't even think about
pulling that shit on me.

07:46.425 --> 07:47.551
I know it's you.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.721
Trust me lady, there's no Eric
here, have a good night.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.561
Jesus.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.522
- What?
- Why did you hang up on me?

08:01.148 --> 08:05.027
Look, there's no one called Eric at
this number, so stop calling okay.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.820
Eric, it's Ellen.

08:06.945 --> 08:10.032
I don't give a shit what your name
is, I'm not Eric, so stop calling me.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.217
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.513
You making another one
of your seaweed concoctions?

08:33.222 --> 08:34.264
Ya.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.892
- Want some?
- No thanks, I'll pass.

08:38.018 --> 08:42.231
Ah by the way,
we had 36 voicemails this morning.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.525
Really, from who?

08:44.775 --> 08:47.486
Not sure, but I think it was the
same chick who called last night.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.531
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

08:50.822 --> 08:53.784
All she does is breathe into the
phone, then hang up and call back.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.203
Weird... did you save
any of them?

08:56.578 --> 08:58.080
Nope... cleared them all.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.249
When was the last time
she called?

09:00.457 --> 09:02.042
4:30, nothing since then.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.378
Hmm, maybe she gave up on us.

09:07.798 --> 09:09.716
Are you sure you don't want
some of this?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.594
Look, I love you,
but that is disgusting.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.429
Just a little bit.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.432
Look, I'm going to drink my
coffee like a normal human being.

09:17.850 --> 09:18.934
This is better for you.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.021
Please, if you make me drink
that, I'm going to throw up all over you.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.481
Please, please, please.

09:27.276 --> 09:28.443
Boring.

09:29.695 --> 09:32.698
Yes... I completely understand.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.200
Thank you very much
for your time anyway.

09:36.285 --> 09:37.327
Bye.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.957
So, what was the reason
this time?

09:42.583 --> 09:44.918
Same thing as last time,
no local references.

09:48.672 --> 09:49.715
Well...

09:49.798 --> 09:51.925
how in hell are we supposed
to have local references

09:52.009 --> 09:54.469
if no one will hire us
without them in the first place?

09:54.845 --> 09:56.388
I think there's more
to it than that.

09:56.471 --> 10:00.184
I say for future interviews we
don't mention we're actors from L.A.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.102
that need to available
to go on auditions

10:02.186 --> 10:05.480
because in small towns like this,
they don't get people like us.

10:05.856 --> 10:10.819
Okay, so basically we're screwed if we
find a job, and screwed if we don't.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.989
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Okay.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.292
- Babe.
- What?

10:25.667 --> 10:27.127
We're kind of
in the middle of dinner.

10:27.211 --> 10:29.505
No we're in the middle of eating
Romaine lettuce

10:29.588 --> 10:32.174
which I don't think constitutes dinner.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.933
- You're shitting me.
- Don't answer it.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.602
No babe, if it's her she's just
going to keep calling and calling.

10:44.228 --> 10:47.481
- Just unplug it.
- No, I'm going to nip this in the bud right now.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.944
- Hello.
- Eric. Why are you ignoring me?

10:52.110 --> 10:54.488
Look lady, I have tried
to be nice about this

10:54.571 --> 10:58.659
but I have told you over and over
again, there is no one named Eric

10:59.076 --> 11:01.161
who lives at this number,
so stop calling us

11:01.495 --> 11:03.455
or we're going to be forced
to call the police.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.707
What do you mean, "us"?

11:06.458 --> 11:07.668
Is someone there with you?

11:07.751 --> 11:11.171
That's none of your business, are you
going to stop calling here, or what?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.465
You have a woman
there, don't you?

11:14.341 --> 11:16.134
Okay, have a good night, bye.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.720
Psycho.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.390
This is getting, ridiculous.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.892
Look, in the morning, I'm just going
to call--

11:25.143 --> 11:26.395
You know what,
allow me.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.859
Look Ellen, or whatever the hell
your name is

11:31.942 --> 11:34.444
you're starting to be a royal
pain in the ass.

11:34.528 --> 11:35.571
Stop calling us!

11:36.029 --> 11:37.573
Put Eric back on the phone,
bitch!

11:38.073 --> 11:39.199
Lady, are you deaf?

11:39.533 --> 11:41.034
There is no Eric here!

11:41.368 --> 11:43.453
Liar, give him the goddam phone!

11:48.750 --> 11:50.377
We definitely need to unplug it.

11:51.962 --> 11:53.005
Man...

12:12.024 --> 12:15.152
- How many were there?
- 58.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.863
- Any messages?
- No.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.531
Just heavy breathing
like last time.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.242
What are we going to do?

12:27.039 --> 12:28.749
What the hell
is a ghostline?

12:29.917 --> 12:33.504
It's a line you can make phone calls
from, without having a specific number.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.506
And there's no way to trace it?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.466
No sir, I'm afraid not.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.302
How is that even possible?

12:41.303 --> 12:43.055
It's hard to explain.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.015
Would you like to speak
with my supervisor?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.558
No, that's not going to be
necessary.

12:46.642 --> 12:49.353
Look, can you just tell me
who had the number before us?

12:50.062 --> 12:52.689
Sorry, but we're not allowed to
give out that kind of information.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.609
But what I can do is provide
you with a new phone number.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.402
That should solve your problem.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.654
Perfect.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.953
And, boom goes the dynamite.

13:08.872 --> 13:09.957
Oh no.

13:10.666 --> 13:12.417
Is that Heather?

13:12.501 --> 13:13.919
No it's another
unknown caller.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.712
Well, go ahead and answer it.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.674
It can't possibly
be that Ellen bitch.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.468
Put it on speaker.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.136
- Hello.
- Dude.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.180
Took you long enough to answer.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.808
- Catch you sleeping?
- Hey Bobby, what's up man?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.519
Just checking in to see how you
two are doing in the new digs.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.271
Oh yeah, everything's cool.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.982
Hey, how come your name didn't
come up on the caller I.D?

13:35.274 --> 13:37.901
Oh it's this new cellphone,
I'm still trying to figure it out.

13:39.027 --> 13:42.155
- Bobby it's Chelsea.
- Hey Chels', what's shaking?

13:42.573 --> 13:44.324
It's all good,
we miss you guys.

13:44.408 --> 13:47.995
Oh we miss you too...
hey hold on a sec man, I got another call.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.121
Alright.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.958
Crap, this thing ain't working...
I'll call you back in a few, okay?

13:53.125 --> 13:55.085
Okay, take your time man.

13:55.294 --> 13:58.797
Oh, I can't wait to find out if Heather
got that part on Serenity Falls.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.883
I know, I just hope she had
a better experience

14:00.966 --> 14:03.010
with that casting director
than you did.

14:03.302 --> 14:06.263
Because he seemed more interested
in your tits, than in your acting ability.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.266
Actually,
he was kind of cute for an older guy.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.684
Yeah right.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.604
Hey bud, that was quick.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.023
Hello.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.901
Did you really think you could
get rid of me that easily?

14:23.614 --> 14:25.908
Mr. Jantzen, other than
identifying herself as Ellen.

14:26.074 --> 14:30.120
Did she reveal any information, such
as, where she lives, or where she works?

14:30.204 --> 14:33.832
- No.
- Mrs. Jantzen, how many times did you actually talk to her?

14:34.458 --> 14:36.919
Once, and my last name
is Watkins.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.338
- But you can call me Chelsea.
- And I'm Tyler.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.340
Ok, Tyler and Chelsea.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.635
Let me get this straight, phone calls
started right after you moved in.

14:45.219 --> 14:48.055
Yeah, they started the first
night we got the landline.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.308
- And they've all been at night.
- That's correct.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.145
And what was the word
the phone company used?

14:55.395 --> 14:56.772
- Ghostline?
- Right.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.734
What I don't understand is how
this woman got your new number.

15:01.485 --> 15:02.569
Welcome to the club.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.405
Have you noticed any suspicious
looking women around the neighborhood?

15:05.822 --> 15:07.950
No, we haven't
been outside much though.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.035
I see,
where are you folks from?

15:10.202 --> 15:14.623
L.A. I just inherited the place from a
relative who unexpectedly passed away.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.416
Oh, well I'm sorry
for your loss.

15:16.542 --> 15:17.584
That's okay.

15:17.668 --> 15:18.710
Well, I'll talk to the phone
company

15:18.794 --> 15:20.128
and see if there's anything else
they can do.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.257
Detective Tanner,
what if she calls again tonight?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.260
Until we figure out
who this woman is

15:26.343 --> 15:28.262
I suggest you don't answer
any unknown calls.

15:28.470 --> 15:29.763
But she'll just keep
calling back.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.599
- Unplug it.
- Okay.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.643
Thank you.

15:35.936 --> 15:36.979
Thank you.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.647
I'll be in touch.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.665
So, where did you
decide?

15:57.457 --> 16:00.752
I was thinking, maybe we could try
that Mexican place over by the bowling alley.

16:01.295 --> 16:02.963
As long as they have
strong Margaritas.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.007
Yeah babe,
I like that style.

16:05.174 --> 16:07.009
I thought you would.

16:24.443 --> 16:27.029
We're home.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.036
Thank you.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.873
Easy, easy.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.835
Easy, easy, oh.

16:47.508 --> 16:50.344
Oh... should have stopped
after three.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.012
You think?

16:54.056 --> 16:55.098
What I think is.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.685
- I'm gonna hurl.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.691
Oh no, not tonight.

17:08.819 --> 17:12.074
No.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.284
No.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.292
- Did you say 82?
- Yup.

17:23.377 --> 17:26.088
And just like before, all we can
hear is heavy breathing.

17:27.381 --> 17:28.632
Well, I'm no psychologist

17:28.715 --> 17:31.301
but, we might be dealing
with a psychopathic insomniac

17:31.468 --> 17:33.428
who has a fixation
on this Eric guy

17:33.512 --> 17:35.347
and she's refusing to believe
you're not him.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.349
What can we do about it?

17:37.933 --> 17:40.644
If we identify her, we can take
the appropriate legal steps

17:40.769 --> 17:42.312
to force her to stop
harassing you.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.982
How do you plan
on identifying her?

17:45.649 --> 17:47.276
That's going to
require some effort on your part.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.987
But as an actor...
it shouldn't be a problem.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.700
So how do you want
me to handle this?

17:55.492 --> 17:56.869
Well, try to get her
to talk about herself.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.454
Maybe she'll slip up
and tell us where she lives.

17:59.997 --> 18:03.000
Detective, did you find out
who had our original number before us?

18:03.125 --> 18:06.753
I did, it belonged to...
Patrick and Maggie Detweiler.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.339
They gave it up when they moved
about eight and a half years ago.

18:09.715 --> 18:11.258
And it's been inactive
since then?

18:11.508 --> 18:14.469
Yeah... oh and I found
out how she got your new number.

18:14.845 --> 18:18.056
Some idiot at the phone company put
in a change of number notification.

18:19.474 --> 18:23.562
So, anyone who calls the old number,
automatically--

18:25.272 --> 18:27.274
- It's her.
- Put her on speaker.

18:31.069 --> 18:33.864
Hello... is anyone there?

18:35.324 --> 18:36.825
Who were you expecting?

18:37.326 --> 18:38.368
What do you want, Ellen?

18:39.244 --> 18:40.495
I want you, Eric.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.998
Yeah, I get that,
but like I've been trying to tell you.

18:43.498 --> 18:44.541
I'm not Eric.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.335
Why do you keep saying that?

18:46.543 --> 18:47.878
Because it's the truth.

18:48.504 --> 18:51.548
Stop lying.
Of all your undesirable traits

18:51.965 --> 18:54.009
that's the one I've always hated
the most.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.929
Look Ellen, if this Eric dude
is such a terrible guy

18:57.012 --> 18:58.305
then why do you still want him?

18:59.723 --> 19:01.558
That woman's
still there, isn't she?

19:04.645 --> 19:05.771
Er, what woman?

19:06.480 --> 19:07.940
You know who I'm talking about.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.984
No, I'm home alone.

19:11.485 --> 19:13.445
Liar! I bet she's listening in.

19:14.780 --> 19:17.908
Look Ellen, it's just
you and me on the phone, okay.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.576
Now if you'll just
tell me where you are--

19:23.038 --> 19:24.081
Jesus.

19:24.456 --> 19:25.499
How was that?

19:26.375 --> 19:29.461
Hello... Ellen
are you still there?

19:29.586 --> 19:31.088
We're trying your call again.

19:31.713 --> 19:32.881
Bitch hung up.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.845
This is the first thing I thought,
that woman is utterly delusional.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.013
Oh, she is worse
than delusional.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.683
- This chick is unhinged!
- Yeah, no shit.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.894
What do you want me to do next time
she calls, what do you want me to say?

19:46.728 --> 19:48.063
Something to draw
her out.

19:49.106 --> 19:50.190
I got it.

19:50.524 --> 19:53.151
Tell her that she's right, and that
you've just been playing with her.

19:53.652 --> 19:55.904
You want me to falsely admit
that I'm this Eric guy?

19:56.238 --> 19:58.782
Exactly... and then ask to meet
her somewhere in public.

19:59.908 --> 20:01.159
I don't like that idea.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.953
Yeah, I'm not crazy
about it either.

20:03.996 --> 20:05.455
You want to find out
who she is, or not?

20:08.709 --> 20:12.045
Alright... yeah if that's what you think
is going to take to end this nightmare.

20:13.672 --> 20:15.174
Excellent.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.100
Well, it's been
over an hour.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.935
If she doesn't call soon
I'm going to have to leave.

20:27.102 --> 20:28.478
I understand.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.981
Here we go.

20:34.151 --> 20:35.194
Hello.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.196
Is she gone.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.324
- Yes, I made her go home.
- Good.

20:42.576 --> 20:43.619
Where are you?

20:44.369 --> 20:45.996
In a very dark place.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.457
I see.

20:49.416 --> 20:53.504
Look, I'm sorry I made you angry
earlier, I was just messing with you.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.964
Of course... I'm Eric.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.634
- I know.
- And I'd like to see you again.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.178
So maybe I could meet you
in a bar, or a coffee shop?

21:03.347 --> 21:07.100
Oh don't worry,
you'll be seeing me soon enough.

21:07.684 --> 21:08.810
What does that mean?

21:09.436 --> 21:11.146
I'm going to find you, Eric.

21:11.230 --> 21:13.232
And when I do.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.609
I'll make you pay
for what you did to me.

21:16.735 --> 21:17.861
What the hell
are you talking about?

21:19.696 --> 21:20.822
Hello?

21:21.823 --> 21:22.866
Hey, Ellen?

21:24.576 --> 21:26.286
She's gone.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.968
Due to the nature of the threat, Detective
Starr will be working with me henceforth.

21:41.385 --> 21:43.387
- Happy to have you aboard, detective.
- Thank you.

21:44.221 --> 21:46.765
After conferring with detective
Tanner this morning

21:46.849 --> 21:48.392
I got to thinking,

21:48.767 --> 21:51.186
how many young women
by the name of Ellen

21:51.311 --> 21:54.273
could there be living in a
community of thirty two thousand?

21:54.857 --> 21:55.899
And...

21:56.024 --> 21:57.943
Surprisingly, there's over
a hundred.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.237
However, only two of them

22:00.320 --> 22:01.905
match the profile
we've created

22:02.239 --> 22:03.365
for this particular person.

22:04.449 --> 22:07.452
And unfortunately they both have
alibis for last night.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.621
So where does that leave us?

22:10.747 --> 22:13.876
We asked our boss to authorize
posting a squad car outside your home.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.419
However, he turned us down.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.337
It's a resource issue.

22:17.838 --> 22:19.173
But, here's the good news.

22:19.548 --> 22:21.884
We believe that if Ellen
actually saw you

22:22.426 --> 22:24.052
she'd know right away
that you're not Eric.

22:24.928 --> 22:27.514
We believe it's entirely
possible that your voices are similar

22:27.764 --> 22:29.266
and that's why
she's pursuing him.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.268
But, just to be on the safe side

22:31.810 --> 22:34.313
we recommend that you install
a hi-tech security system.

22:35.439 --> 22:37.316
We're barely making ends meet
as it is.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.443
We simply can't afford it.

22:39.985 --> 22:41.528
Well do you own a gun?

22:43.071 --> 22:45.449
No... no.

22:45.949 --> 22:49.244
We never like to encourage anyone
to bring a weapon into their home

22:49.620 --> 22:51.580
but in this case,
you may want to consider it.

22:51.997 --> 22:53.874
Sorry, not an option.

22:54.791 --> 22:55.834
Well then all we can
suggest

22:55.918 --> 22:58.545
is that you keep all your doors
and windows locked at all times.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.173
And don't go out at night unless
it's absolutely necessary.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.217
Actually we were going out
tonight.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.851
Here's to four years
of unwedded bliss.

23:13.519 --> 23:15.187
And they said it wouldn't last.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.940
Can't believe we're actually
toasting with water.

23:18.482 --> 23:21.902
After the other night, I don't even
want to look at booze for a while.

23:22.027 --> 23:23.153
I hear ya.

23:26.490 --> 23:27.950
Ok.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.035
Don't look now.

23:30.786 --> 23:33.080
But some chick is staring
at you from across the room.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.832
- Seriously?
- I said don't look.

23:36.375 --> 23:37.709
You don't think it's Ellen,
do you?

23:39.211 --> 23:42.214
- Why don't you go ask her?
- What would I say?

23:43.465 --> 23:46.844
I don't know, how about, "are you the psycho
bitch from hell, who thinks I'm Eric?"

23:47.386 --> 23:50.931
The detective said that
Ellen is looking for Eric, not me.

23:51.431 --> 23:53.976
Okay, get up
and walk to the bathroom.

23:54.685 --> 23:57.354
- But I don't have to go.
- I just want to see what she does.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.773
Fine, I'll go wash my hands,
okay?

24:07.406 --> 24:09.741
- You're food is coming right up ma'am.
- Thank you.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.076
Sure you don't want
something from the bar?

24:11.869 --> 24:13.745
Positive.

24:21.795 --> 24:25.215
- What happened?
- She just took a picture of you.

24:25.924 --> 24:27.426
Terrific.

24:33.265 --> 24:35.017
Detective Tanner,
this is Chelsea Watkins.

24:36.185 --> 24:37.811
Yeah, we're fine,
but listen.

24:38.937 --> 24:40.189
I think we might
have found Ellen.

24:55.621 --> 24:56.663
See ya, bitch.

25:01.919 --> 25:03.754
- Si.
- Muchas gracias.

25:04.713 --> 25:05.756
Gracias.

25:08.300 --> 25:09.885
- So we'll wait, yeah?
- Yeah.

25:13.138 --> 25:14.723
- Evening folks.
- Hey detective.

25:14.890 --> 25:16.016
Thanks for coming,
have a seat.

25:19.603 --> 25:20.646
Well?

25:21.522 --> 25:22.814
Her name is Tammy Edwards.

25:23.273 --> 25:24.816
Her divorce is final today.

25:25.984 --> 25:27.319
And she thinks Tyler's hot.

25:29.154 --> 25:30.197
I get that a lot.

25:31.114 --> 25:32.616
Oh, here we go.

25:33.617 --> 25:35.869
Sorry to waste your time detective,
we appreciate you coming down.

25:36.787 --> 25:37.955
No worries,
it's my job.

25:38.747 --> 25:40.749
Speaking of which,
are you two still looking for work?

25:56.181 --> 25:58.851
I hate working banquets,
unless I get to bartend.

25:59.268 --> 26:01.770
Still, it was sweet of detective
Tanner to recommend us.

26:02.855 --> 26:03.897
Huh!

26:04.565 --> 26:07.401
- No calls.
- Ah, would you look at that.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.152
Maybe she got the message.

26:09.695 --> 26:11.238
One can only hope.

26:20.497 --> 26:23.000
Oh man, I am going to sleep in
so late tomorrow.

26:23.417 --> 26:24.668
No arguing here.

26:27.087 --> 26:28.130
Huh.

26:28.547 --> 26:30.132
Nothing.

26:31.133 --> 26:33.677
Come on... shit.

26:34.094 --> 26:35.220
Where's the flashlight?

26:35.304 --> 26:36.597
Uh, in the kitchen
drawer.

26:49.234 --> 26:50.402
- Chels'.
- What?

26:50.527 --> 26:52.321
Come here, quick.

26:52.696 --> 26:54.448
If you're looking for the
coffee, it's inside the--

26:55.032 --> 26:56.158
Holy shit!

26:56.909 --> 26:58.202
- What happened?
- You tell me.

26:58.535 --> 27:00.871
How am I supposed to know?
I didn't even open the fridge last night.

27:02.539 --> 27:03.999
I'm going to check the doors
and windows.

27:15.928 --> 27:18.931
Everything's locked up, there's
no way anyone got in here without a key.

27:19.473 --> 27:21.433
Well I guarantee the fridge
didn't open up

27:21.517 --> 27:22.935
and expel its contents
by itself.

27:23.060 --> 27:24.186
Thank you, I understand that.

27:25.187 --> 27:28.273
I don't know, maybe...
one of us is sleepwalking or something.

27:28.899 --> 27:29.942
And violent.

27:30.526 --> 27:31.944
I don't know
what to tell you Chels'.

27:54.758 --> 27:58.428
I thought it was funny when your
divorcee stalker had a handsome date.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.098
Yeah, you know,
she was trying to make me jealous.

28:02.641 --> 28:04.560
Hey, we left the doggy bag
in the car.

28:04.768 --> 28:05.853
Ah, I'll go grab it.

28:13.110 --> 28:14.403
Tyler!

28:14.486 --> 28:16.947
What?

28:29.418 --> 28:32.713
Tyler... what the hell,
is going on?

28:33.130 --> 28:34.173
I don't know.

28:35.591 --> 28:37.843
Come here.

28:39.303 --> 28:40.345
It's going to be okay.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.433
That security system is starting to
look pretty good to me right now.

28:44.516 --> 28:49.104
- Ya... did you leave the door open?
- No.

28:54.276 --> 28:55.444
Wait, did you pick up
my jacket?

28:56.945 --> 28:58.697
- No.
- Well that's weird,

28:58.780 --> 29:01.116
because I distinctly remember
tossing it on the couch.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.285
And I saw you do it.

29:21.053 --> 29:24.473
You sure your aunt didn't have a few
house keys floating around somewhere?

29:24.848 --> 29:27.226
No, we had the locks changed
before we moved in.

29:27.768 --> 29:30.687
If you decide to install a security
system, this guy will work within a price.

29:31.647 --> 29:33.565
- Alright thank you.
- Okay.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.317
We're a phone call away
if you need us.

30:29.621 --> 30:30.956
what you doing?

30:31.206 --> 30:33.041
I think I'm going to put some
coffee on.

30:35.794 --> 30:37.671
No... uh.

30:38.213 --> 30:40.757
Stay in bed, it's Sunday
for Christ sake.

30:42.176 --> 30:44.178
Can't we sleep in one day
a week?

30:44.261 --> 30:45.804
No baby,
I got stuff to do.

30:52.769 --> 30:54.146
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:54.521 --> 30:56.190
Anything weird
go on this morning?

30:56.732 --> 30:58.275
Actually, no.

30:58.483 --> 30:59.776
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

31:01.236 --> 31:03.697
- Hey babe, have you seen my wallet?
- No.

31:12.831 --> 31:13.874
What's wrong?

31:15.167 --> 31:16.793
Is that supposed to be
some sort of a joke?

31:18.170 --> 31:19.213
Holy shit!

31:19.421 --> 31:22.132
- Did you know about this?
- No, I didn't open up the refrigerator this morning.

31:22.966 --> 31:24.009
Get rid of it!

31:37.773 --> 31:40.025
Hey... where
did you find my wallet?

31:40.901 --> 31:41.985
Right where you left it.

31:42.402 --> 31:44.655
Well that's weird,
because I haven't been outside yet.

31:45.072 --> 31:47.324
Whatever...
you get rid of the rat?

31:47.658 --> 31:48.700
Yeah I did.

31:49.618 --> 31:51.245
So look, I just got off
the phone with Bobby.

31:52.287 --> 31:53.789
What do you say we head down
to L.A. for the day?

32:03.090 --> 32:05.050
That shit
is unreal.

32:05.551 --> 32:08.053
And the cops think that
Ellen chick is behind it all?

32:08.136 --> 32:09.847
Bro, I don't really know
what they think.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.265
Can we get you guys
anything else?

32:11.515 --> 32:12.933
- Oh no, we're fine.
- I'm good.

32:13.976 --> 32:16.645
You know, this ghostline thing reminds
me of a TV show I saw once as a kid.

32:17.229 --> 32:18.272
What was it about?

32:18.438 --> 32:20.649
Well, there was this telephone
pole next to a cemetery

32:21.108 --> 32:22.317
and from his grave

32:22.401 --> 32:25.654
a dead guy was able to communicate
with an old lady over the phone

32:25.779 --> 32:27.072
or something like that.

32:27.531 --> 32:29.992
Pumpkin, are you suggesting
they're being haunted by a ghost.

32:30.993 --> 32:34.246
Well think about it... First the
phone calls, all at night, by the way.

32:34.705 --> 32:37.708
The threat, and now bizarre
things happening in their house.

32:37.958 --> 32:40.377
Heather, you're letting all these
ghosts on these shows go to your head.

32:40.544 --> 32:42.254
- I mean, you don't really believe--
- I...

32:42.963 --> 32:44.381
I think she's on to something.

32:45.215 --> 32:47.342
Come on, don't tell me you
believe in that bullshit.

32:48.385 --> 32:49.761
Do you have a better theory, Ty?

32:50.429 --> 32:51.638
It's ridiculous.

32:52.389 --> 32:54.641
Is that right?
Okay Mr. tough guy.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.895
- You two can come stay with us for a couple of nights.
- I'm down with that.

32:58.061 --> 32:59.438
Not me, sorry guys.

32:59.897 --> 33:02.191
You told me yesterday you
were dying to see their house.

33:02.274 --> 33:03.775
Yeah, but not with all this shit
going on.

33:03.984 --> 33:05.068
Good call, girlfriend.

33:05.485 --> 33:06.528
Well I'm still coming.

33:06.695 --> 33:08.697
Actually man, it's probably best
to wait it out a couple of weeks.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.741
Just until we get all this
stuff sorted out, you know.

33:12.993 --> 33:14.286
By the way Heather,

33:14.745 --> 33:16.622
I am so sorry
you did not get that part.

33:16.872 --> 33:19.082
Ah thanks. You know
the frustrating thing

33:19.166 --> 33:23.712
is that old creep ended up casting an actress,
who's only attribute was a huge rack.

33:25.088 --> 33:26.256
And I don't even think
they were real.

33:27.925 --> 33:28.967
Surprise, surprise.

34:21.018 --> 34:23.522
I just think a good night's
rest is going to do us well.

34:23.605 --> 34:24.648
Yeah, I think so.

34:24.731 --> 34:25.774
What the hell.

34:31.989 --> 34:34.741
Chels'... look.

34:44.668 --> 34:45.918
We need to talk.

34:46.460 --> 34:47.504
Okay.

34:54.386 --> 34:57.639
Look, whoever's doing this is
just trying to scare us away.

34:57.973 --> 34:59.933
Well guess what...
it's working.

35:01.351 --> 35:03.937
Tyler... I know it's
hard for you to fathom

35:04.021 --> 35:05.147
but what if Heather's right?

35:05.564 --> 35:07.608
Chelsea, it's going to take
a lot more than this

35:07.691 --> 35:10.444
to convince me we have a ghost
living in our house, okay.

35:11.570 --> 35:14.031
Hey! I'm not done
talking to you.

35:14.114 --> 35:15.574
I'm just going to lock
the front door

35:15.657 --> 35:17.951
and then hit the bathroom,
if that's okay with you.

35:20.662 --> 35:21.705
Okay.

35:31.048 --> 35:32.799
Come on Chelsea,
I got to take a pee.

35:35.010 --> 35:36.386
What, are you going to make
me go outside?

35:37.221 --> 35:38.472
Chels'.

35:38.555 --> 35:41.642
Who are you talking
to?

36:16.385 --> 36:17.427
Okay look.

36:18.053 --> 36:19.304
You might think I'm crazy

36:20.013 --> 36:22.516
but what happened last night
re-enforces my belief

36:22.599 --> 36:25.018
that something very evil is in
our house.

36:25.602 --> 36:26.645
You mean like a demon?

36:27.145 --> 36:29.481
No... I'm thinking ghost.

36:30.607 --> 36:31.859
What are you thinking, Tyler?

36:32.109 --> 36:35.487
All I can say right now, is that my
belief system is in a state of upheaval.

36:36.363 --> 36:38.073
You know, in the law
enforcement profession

36:38.156 --> 36:40.117
we have to choose
our words very carefully

36:40.200 --> 36:42.077
when it comes
to controversial issues

36:42.452 --> 36:44.705
- such as the paranormal.
- As you can imagine

36:44.788 --> 36:46.456
we're trained to approach
every situation

36:46.540 --> 36:48.208
from a common sense
point of view.

36:48.375 --> 36:49.668
I told you they wouldn't
believe us.

36:49.835 --> 36:51.211
No,
that's not what we're saying.

36:52.546 --> 36:54.047
Off the record... we believe

36:54.131 --> 36:55.340
that there's a distinct
possibility

36:55.424 --> 36:58.969
that what you're experiencing is,
in fact... paranormal activity.

36:59.386 --> 37:00.429
Okay.

37:00.971 --> 37:02.139
Okay, so how do we deal
with that?

37:02.973 --> 37:04.600
I'm going to recommend
someone for you to talk to.

37:04.683 --> 37:06.393
But first, we want
to bring you up to speed

37:06.476 --> 37:07.686
on our investigation.

37:07.853 --> 37:11.231
We located the folks who had the
number, that Ellen originally called.

37:11.523 --> 37:13.442
- Okay.
- According to Mr. Dettweiller,

37:13.692 --> 37:15.235
the main reason they left town

37:15.319 --> 37:16.612
was to get away
from the nephew.

37:17.029 --> 37:20.449
An unemployed construction worker,
by the name of Eric Chambers.

37:21.575 --> 37:23.660
Apparently he'd been
leaching off him for years.

37:23.994 --> 37:25.287
But here's the interesting part.

37:25.495 --> 37:27.372
Eight years ago,
the police questioned Eric

37:27.539 --> 37:29.416
regarding the disappearance
of his girlfriend,

37:30.042 --> 37:31.668
Ellen Pendleton.

37:33.212 --> 37:35.714
But unfortunately there
was no evidence of foul play

37:35.797 --> 37:37.299
and Ellen's body
was never found.

37:37.799 --> 37:39.635
We also need to point
out, that since then

37:39.718 --> 37:42.054
there's been seven
other unresolved cases

37:42.137 --> 37:43.555
of missing women in Lovejoy.

37:45.599 --> 37:49.228
- Was this Eric guy suspected in any of those cases?
- No.

37:49.311 --> 37:51.355
Here again,
no bodies, no evidence.

37:53.273 --> 37:55.275
Now, about your little problem.

38:04.284 --> 38:07.829
So then Marina and I decided
to form the Lovejoy paranormal society

38:07.913 --> 38:09.373
or, L.P.S for short.

38:10.499 --> 38:12.626
But we're not
restricted to Lovejoy.

38:13.001 --> 38:15.629
Scott and I investigate hauntings
all over the south west.

38:15.796 --> 38:18.549
Hmm...
so as ghost hunters, what's the craziest

38:18.632 --> 38:19.883
thing you guys
have ever seen?

38:21.426 --> 38:22.469
Go ahead.

38:23.095 --> 38:26.098
Well I guess it would have to be the
apparition of a woman we encountered

38:26.265 --> 38:29.268
at the old Linda Vista hospital
in L.A a few years ago.

38:30.102 --> 38:31.812
And you saw her face
and everything?

38:33.397 --> 38:35.190
It was more like
a human shaped shadow.

38:35.941 --> 38:36.984
Let me tell you something.

38:37.526 --> 38:39.027
It scared the crap out of us.

38:41.196 --> 38:43.156
I think you have
some new admirers.

38:43.907 --> 38:45.534
Yeah, I saw that earlier.

38:46.368 --> 38:48.495
What can I say babe,
when you got it, you got it.

38:52.124 --> 38:56.086
I remember the good old days, when the cute
girls used to look at me like that and smile.

38:57.504 --> 39:00.632
- And now they laugh out loud?
- Yeah pretty much.

39:01.925 --> 39:03.343
Anyone like any more coffee?

39:03.886 --> 39:04.928
No thank you.

39:05.804 --> 39:06.847
Right, so...

39:07.431 --> 39:09.183
How do we do
this ghost hunting thing?

39:09.600 --> 39:11.059
Well actually it's very simple.

39:11.143 --> 39:13.270
We just need access
to your house for one night.

39:14.563 --> 39:15.606
Oh.

39:17.107 --> 39:18.150
Okay, yeah.

39:50.349 --> 39:52.392
Hello Ellen,
I'm Scott.

39:53.060 --> 39:54.186
And this is Marina.

39:54.770 --> 39:56.021
We mean you no harm.

39:56.438 --> 39:58.190
We just want to talk with you.

40:03.946 --> 40:07.950
Why are you doing all these nasty
things to Chelsea and Tyler, huh?

40:16.792 --> 40:18.627
Justin, are you getting anything
on your camera?

40:19.294 --> 40:23.423
- Nada.
- I don't see anything in here.

40:24.550 --> 40:25.968
I don't know...

40:28.011 --> 40:31.306
- Seems a little--
- Hey you know what, let's try the master bedroom.

40:46.071 --> 40:49.324
Marina, this is really quiet in
here, I'm not finding anything.

40:49.700 --> 40:50.826
Anything on your meter?

40:52.411 --> 40:53.704
Nothing really.

40:56.373 --> 40:57.583
It's really quiet.

41:04.214 --> 41:05.340
You know what, Justin.

41:06.049 --> 41:07.551
Why don't you go ahead
and cut the camera.

41:07.843 --> 41:09.261
We're going to try
something else.

41:25.777 --> 41:27.112
I'm not getting a damned thing.

41:27.905 --> 41:30.282
I'm beginning to think these
folks are just messing with us.

41:31.825 --> 41:34.953
- You know what, let's just do an EVP session.
- Okay.

41:40.292 --> 41:41.335
What time is it?

41:43.128 --> 41:44.505
Coming up on 2:00 am.

41:47.049 --> 41:48.091
You want to pack it in?

41:48.342 --> 41:51.136
Might as well, we're just
wasting our time here.

41:56.266 --> 41:57.809
I'm pretty sure
that wasn't the wind.

41:59.144 --> 42:00.479
Hey Justin,
grab your camera.

42:00.562 --> 42:01.647
- Let's go.
- Copy that.

42:17.204 --> 42:18.247
Are you ready?

42:22.417 --> 42:23.460
Hello.

42:24.503 --> 42:25.546
Hello.

42:29.132 --> 42:30.300
Is anyone in here?

42:32.386 --> 42:34.221
Ellen?

42:39.643 --> 42:42.855
- Scott, this door didn't close by itself.
- I know.

42:51.613 --> 42:53.532
Hey guys,
my battery just croaked.

42:53.782 --> 42:54.908
I'm gonna go get a new one.

42:55.784 --> 42:56.952
Okay,
but make it fast.

43:12.676 --> 43:14.094
Where the hell
did Justin go?

43:16.722 --> 43:17.806
Er, Scott.

43:18.849 --> 43:19.892
What?

43:21.101 --> 43:22.519
Oh my God!

43:25.731 --> 43:28.108
- Let' try to make contact.
- Seriously?

43:29.276 --> 43:31.361
- It's what we do, isn't it?
- Yeah but--

43:32.905 --> 43:35.490
Hi, I'm Scott,
and this is Marina.

43:36.658 --> 43:37.701
Are you Ellen?

43:39.203 --> 43:40.537
We don't
mean you any harm.

43:41.330 --> 43:42.414
We just want to talk.

43:55.302 --> 43:57.513
Holy shit, let's get out of here!

43:59.223 --> 44:00.349
Open the door.

44:00.474 --> 44:02.976
- Marina, open the door!
- I'm trying!

44:03.060 --> 44:04.144
Marina!

44:12.903 --> 44:16.823
Look, there are ghosts,
and there are poltergeists.

44:17.366 --> 44:20.452
Which you traditionally describe
as malicious ghosts.

44:22.538 --> 44:25.541
In my opinion... what you have
is a poltergeist.

44:27.209 --> 44:28.919
And a very pissed off one
at that.

44:29.711 --> 44:31.046
Did you guys catch her on tape?

44:31.672 --> 44:34.341
- Unfortunately no.
- What does she want from us?

44:34.967 --> 44:36.134
We have no idea.

44:36.510 --> 44:37.636
How do we get rid of her?

44:38.470 --> 44:40.973
Listen, I can't vouch
for this guy's credibility.

44:41.223 --> 44:44.560
But he claims he can rid any
house of any malicious spirit.

44:45.936 --> 44:47.229
Mort Castleberry?

44:48.021 --> 44:49.690
I would call him if I were you.

44:50.941 --> 44:52.234
Listen, we got to go.

44:53.527 --> 44:55.487
Aren't you guys going to come
back, and pick up your stuff?

44:55.904 --> 44:56.947
Yeah,
but do us a favor

44:57.030 --> 45:00.242
Put it all in your driveway, because we're
never setting foot in that house again.

45:09.960 --> 45:11.003
So this is Ellen, huh?

45:12.129 --> 45:13.922
- Yup.
- She's very pretty.

45:14.840 --> 45:15.966
So what are your plans?

45:16.800 --> 45:17.885
Chelsea wants to leave.

45:18.468 --> 45:20.262
Well, I can certainly
understand why.

45:20.929 --> 45:22.973
- Thank you.
- And I assume you want to stay.

45:23.557 --> 45:25.809
Look, the way things are going
with our acting careers right now,

45:25.893 --> 45:29.229
this may be the only opportunity
we have to own property again.

45:29.479 --> 45:31.732
Not if we sell it,
and use the money to buy something else.

45:31.815 --> 45:33.483
Nothing's selling
in this town, Chels'.

45:33.984 --> 45:37.362
Plus even if we were lucky enough to find
a buyer, we'd never get what it's worth.

45:38.363 --> 45:39.406
Tyler's right.

45:40.073 --> 45:42.910
This is one of the most depressed
real estate markets in the state.

45:43.744 --> 45:45.704
So in other words,
we're stuck in this goddamn place?

45:45.787 --> 45:47.623
You know what,
just take the car and go back to L.A.

45:47.873 --> 45:50.542
I'm sure that Bobby and Heather will
let you crash with them for a few days.

45:51.585 --> 45:52.794
Are you serious?

45:52.878 --> 45:54.379
Look, maybe if I'm in the house
by myself

45:54.463 --> 45:55.964
Ellen will reveal herself to me

45:56.048 --> 45:58.300
and I can finally prove
I'm not the guy she's after.

46:00.385 --> 46:02.846
No... if you're staying,
so am I.

46:02.971 --> 46:05.265
- Chels', we have no idea what kind of--
- Excuse me.

46:05.724 --> 46:06.767
Can I make a suggestion.

46:09.728 --> 46:11.647
We really appreciate
this detective.

46:11.897 --> 46:13.023
Well like I was saying,

46:13.106 --> 46:16.109
I've got no family or social life to
speak of, so it's really not a problem.

46:16.944 --> 46:18.820
And look, we're going to be
roomies for the next few days.

46:19.029 --> 46:21.490
- Feel free to call me Nick.
- Alright, cool Nick, thanks.

46:22.241 --> 46:23.659
Now look,
there's somewhere I need to be.

46:24.201 --> 46:25.327
But you just got here.

46:25.619 --> 46:27.829
I know, but I'll be back
before dark... don't worry.

46:28.455 --> 46:29.498
Is there somewhere
I can put this bag?

46:29.915 --> 46:31.416
Oh, I can take it, yeah.

46:39.675 --> 46:41.760
Is that why you're here,
to talk about Ellen Pendleton?

46:42.761 --> 46:43.804
That's right.

46:44.513 --> 46:46.640
Well nothing's changed,
I still have no idea where she went.

46:47.766 --> 46:48.809
You two were pretty close,
right?

46:49.434 --> 46:51.061
Yeah, you could say that.

46:52.020 --> 46:53.355
Then we have good news for you.

46:53.647 --> 46:55.941
- How so?
- We believe she's back in town.

46:57.401 --> 46:59.945
Really... how do you know that?

47:00.988 --> 47:02.739
For starters, she called
your old phone number.

47:03.365 --> 47:05.784
Which was given to someone else,
and she asked for you?

47:06.243 --> 47:07.286
Huh?

47:07.953 --> 47:09.955
And there are two people who
claim to have actually seen her.

47:10.205 --> 47:11.248
Is that so?

47:12.332 --> 47:14.126
Sure wasn't someone
who just looks like her.

47:14.835 --> 47:16.795
No... they made a positive I.D.

47:18.046 --> 47:19.464
Mr. Chambers,
I'm confused.

47:19.965 --> 47:21.675
I'd have thought you'd be
thrilled to know that she's alive

47:21.758 --> 47:22.801
and back in town.

47:23.427 --> 47:25.387
Of course I am...
why wouldn't I be?

47:27.264 --> 47:28.891
We're going to let you know that
because of this new information

47:28.974 --> 47:30.601
we've officially
closed our case.

47:31.560 --> 47:32.603
Whatever.

47:36.815 --> 47:38.192
Have a nice day Mr. Chambers.

47:38.901 --> 47:39.943
Yeah.

47:41.153 --> 47:42.196
One more thing.

47:43.697 --> 47:44.823
The people who saw her.

47:45.991 --> 47:47.826
They said she seemed
very angry.

47:48.952 --> 47:50.162
Do you have any idea why?

47:52.039 --> 47:53.081
No.

48:11.225 --> 48:12.809
Chelsea, the sauce
is delicious.

48:13.685 --> 48:16.855
It's my Sicilian grandmother's
special recipe.

48:17.356 --> 48:20.567
Well I haven't had a home cooked meal in a
long time, let alone one as tasty as this.

48:20.984 --> 48:22.653
Considering what you're doing
for us...

48:23.362 --> 48:24.404
it's the least I could do.

48:24.738 --> 48:26.657
Well, as a bachelor
who survives on

48:26.865 --> 48:28.450
take out and fast food.

48:29.743 --> 48:31.203
I sincerely appreciate it.

48:33.163 --> 48:36.166
So how did Eric react,
when you told him Ellen was back in town?

48:36.708 --> 48:37.960
In a word, surprised.

48:38.585 --> 48:39.628
Where did you find him?

48:40.170 --> 48:41.880
He was in this dive bar
down in Pine.

48:42.256 --> 48:44.466
- Turns out the son of a bitch is a regular there.
- Hmm.

48:45.217 --> 48:48.095
You didn't mention anything about
Ellen being a ghost, did you?

48:48.554 --> 48:50.639
No of course not,
I didn't want to spook him.

48:53.308 --> 48:54.852
Pun intended.

48:56.979 --> 48:58.689
- Um, more wine Nick?
- Yes please.

49:03.151 --> 49:04.695
- Hit me.
- I'll hit you.

49:28.552 --> 49:30.137
Okay,

49:41.190 --> 49:42.232
Are you ready yet?

50:01.043 --> 50:02.920
Nick?

50:15.516 --> 50:16.558
What?

50:17.142 --> 50:18.435
Yuk.

51:16.618 --> 51:18.745
Chels',
what are you doing?

51:41.727 --> 51:43.228
- Tyler what is it?
- It was her.

51:43.645 --> 51:45.939
- What happened?
- Ellen, she was just on top of me.

51:46.148 --> 51:47.191
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

51:47.274 --> 51:48.400
You guys turned on the light
and she left.

51:48.942 --> 51:50.027
I'll check out the house.

51:50.777 --> 51:51.820
Come here.

51:53.739 --> 51:54.823
Come and sit.

51:55.449 --> 51:56.992
- Honey I'm so sorry.
- Where were you?

51:57.284 --> 51:59.453
- I was turning off the TV.
- The TV, why was that on?

51:59.536 --> 52:00.579
I don't know.

52:00.913 --> 52:02.497
Maybe Nick forgot
to turn it off earlier.

52:05.167 --> 52:06.210
Oh god.

52:09.379 --> 52:11.006
- You okay?
- Yeah.

52:11.256 --> 52:12.925
You sure it wasn't a dream?

52:13.717 --> 52:15.260
Yeah, I was definitely awake.

52:16.053 --> 52:17.095
You think it was Ellen.

52:17.679 --> 52:20.307
Yeah I mean,
her face was all...

52:21.183 --> 52:23.894
Shit, I can't even describe
how terrifying it was,

52:24.019 --> 52:25.687
but it didn't look anything
like the picture.

52:26.897 --> 52:28.524
Well, I'll stay up tonight
in case she comes back.

52:29.733 --> 52:30.901
We appreciate that.

53:57.779 --> 53:59.907
Nick... what's up?

54:05.537 --> 54:08.332
What the fuck was that?

54:10.375 --> 54:11.627
What just happened?

54:14.463 --> 54:15.672
What am I doing in here?

54:15.839 --> 54:18.008
- Why the hell are you on top of me?
- You tell me.

54:23.096 --> 54:24.223
Is everyone alright?

54:25.307 --> 54:27.684
We wouldn't have been,
if Tyler hadn't woken up when he did.

54:28.435 --> 54:29.937
I'm so sorry... look.

54:30.229 --> 54:32.356
Under the circumstances,
I think it's best if I go home.

54:33.357 --> 54:35.025
That's okay Nick,
It's not your fault

54:35.108 --> 54:36.902
I think you were possessed
by Ellen's ghost.

54:38.070 --> 54:39.988
Wow, have you come a long way.

54:40.572 --> 54:44.159
A few days ago, you refused to even
acknowledge the existence of ghosts,

54:44.743 --> 54:46.787
and now you're suggesting
spirit possession?

54:46.912 --> 54:50.457
Look, coming face to face with something
as terrifying as Ellen's apparition

54:50.541 --> 54:53.627
is enough to change anyone's
perspective on the spirit world.

54:54.127 --> 54:56.088
Plus the whole possession thing
makes a whole lot more sense

54:56.171 --> 54:59.049
than Nick simply waking up in the middle
of the night, and trying to shoot me.

54:59.758 --> 55:03.595
Actually the concept of spiritual
possession exists in many religions...

55:04.429 --> 55:06.640
including Christianity
and Buddhism.

55:09.434 --> 55:10.853
I studied religion in college.

55:12.271 --> 55:14.189
Look, it's obvious
that up to this point

55:14.273 --> 55:15.941
Ellen has just been
screwing around with you

55:16.024 --> 55:17.693
but I think
in light of tonight's event...

55:18.193 --> 55:19.778
it's perfectly clear
that she wants you dead.

55:20.404 --> 55:21.572
We can't allow that to happen.

55:22.823 --> 55:23.866
I agree

55:24.157 --> 55:26.326
and that's why I think you should
get out while you still can.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.370
Sure we can leave.

55:29.329 --> 55:30.998
Get lucky and sell the house

55:31.081 --> 55:34.418
but what if Ellen were to stick
around, and terrorize the new owners

55:34.501 --> 55:35.627
I mean, what if they had kids?

55:36.670 --> 55:38.463
- I see your point but--
- He's right.

55:39.798 --> 55:41.675
Whether it's our fault or not...

55:42.426 --> 55:45.053
we're still responsible
for Ellen being in this house.

55:46.305 --> 55:48.140
And now it's up to us
to get rid of her.

55:49.933 --> 55:53.145
That's very admirable...
but how do you propose to accomplish that?

55:56.064 --> 55:59.276
Have you ever heard of a ghost
eradicator, named Mort Castleberry

56:02.112 --> 56:05.365
Cleansing tools such as Sage,
incense sticks and holy water

56:05.616 --> 56:07.784
are effective in reducing
negativity

56:07.868 --> 56:10.245
and removing minor ghosts.

56:11.538 --> 56:14.625
But eradicating
a troublesome spirit,

56:14.833 --> 56:16.210
such as the one you describe...

56:16.752 --> 56:18.962
will require much, much
more than that.

56:20.506 --> 56:22.716
So how does you whole
detox program work?

56:25.010 --> 56:27.554
I can't give away any trade
secrets, you understand.

56:27.888 --> 56:29.556
What I can tell you,
is it conforms

56:29.640 --> 56:32.184
to the six basic principles
of spiritual practice.

56:32.601 --> 56:36.146
Which has its origins in,
my research science foundation.

56:36.313 --> 56:38.815
Which is dedicated
to bridging the known

56:39.274 --> 56:41.318
and the unknown worlds.

56:43.612 --> 56:44.947
How long will this take?

56:46.156 --> 56:47.324
Another common question.

56:48.116 --> 56:50.536
That depends... it could take
all night.

56:51.995 --> 56:54.039
And you're sure you don't
want us to stick around.

56:54.748 --> 56:57.918
No, no that's not necessary...
I prefer to work alone.

57:00.879 --> 57:01.922
- Okay then.
- Okay.

57:02.005 --> 57:03.841
I guess we're out of here.

57:04.132 --> 57:06.009
Ah, will a check be okay?

57:09.680 --> 57:10.848
Certainly.

57:12.015 --> 57:13.100
I know where you live.

57:21.149 --> 57:22.609
I should be done here
in about an hour.

57:24.444 --> 57:27.197
...yeah, no they're nice kids,
they're just, you know,

57:27.281 --> 57:29.992
gullible like most people
who believe in this crap.

57:34.121 --> 57:35.163
Yeah.

57:35.539 --> 57:37.541
Well, I'll be there
when I get there.

57:37.666 --> 57:39.960
Okay... alright.

57:41.503 --> 57:43.046
Bye.

57:45.924 --> 57:47.259
Don't these people ever eat?

58:04.276 --> 58:05.777
Smooth.

58:34.306 --> 58:35.891
Ellen.

58:37.601 --> 58:39.561
You and I
need to have a little chat.

59:36.285 --> 59:38.287
Something creepy
about this house.

59:42.749 --> 59:43.876
Case in point.

59:46.628 --> 59:49.047
Probably a... open window.

01:00:03.353 --> 01:00:05.189
I'm getting too old
for this shit.

01:00:22.456 --> 01:00:23.707
Sweet mother Jesus!

01:00:28.086 --> 01:00:29.213
Come on!

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.391
What the hell do you want?

01:00:44.561 --> 01:00:47.189
Please... please leave me alone.

01:00:48.357 --> 01:00:49.983
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:00:50.692 --> 01:00:52.569
Please, please let me go.

01:00:53.237 --> 01:00:54.613
Hey please,
have some mercy.

01:00:55.531 --> 01:00:57.741
If you let me go,
I'll never bother you again

01:00:57.991 --> 01:00:59.034
I swear.

01:01:12.631 --> 01:01:14.967
Guess I showed that stupid bitch
who's boss.

01:01:21.139 --> 01:01:22.182
Oh crap.

01:01:22.933 --> 01:01:24.101
[bones crunch

01:01:27.229 --> 01:01:29.606
The coroner confirmed that the
cause of death was a broken neck.

01:01:31.733 --> 01:01:32.776
Oh my God.

01:01:35.696 --> 01:01:36.738
How did this happen?

01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:39.658
I think we all know
the answer to that question.

01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:44.121
Look, what we have here
is a very sticky situation.

01:01:44.496 --> 01:01:46.790
We know for a fact that you two
were elsewhere when he died...

01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:49.918
but, there's no way we're ever
going to convince our captain.

01:01:50.169 --> 01:01:52.087
And the D.A,
that our perp' is a ghost.

01:01:53.547 --> 01:01:54.756
Then how will you explain it?

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:57.009
The only logical explanation,
is that.

01:01:57.551 --> 01:01:58.802
He was killed
by an intruder.

01:02:02.556 --> 01:02:04.933
Okay.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.062
- Ty'
- Hm.

01:02:09.646 --> 01:02:10.689
What is it?

01:02:12.441 --> 01:02:15.319
I was just thinking that if we
could get Eric to come here...

01:02:16.028 --> 01:02:20.532
then we could finally convince Ellen that
I'm not him, and she would leave us alone.

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:22.492
Mr. Jantzen.

01:02:23.035 --> 01:02:24.077
Listen to me.

01:02:24.745 --> 01:02:26.246
Eric Chambers is bad news.

01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:29.708
You don't want him anywhere near
you, or your lady.

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:31.502
Trust me on that.

01:02:32.794 --> 01:02:35.756
A much better plan, would be for
the two of you to move out of this house

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:37.174
and leave town, immediately.

01:02:39.927 --> 01:02:41.845
- We'll consider it.
- In the meantime.

01:02:42.221 --> 01:02:43.680
This house is a crime scene.

01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:46.308
Until we complete
our investigation...

01:02:47.518 --> 01:02:48.810
you'll need to stay elsewhere.

01:02:58.153 --> 01:02:59.404
She snapped his neck?

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.449
- Like a twig.
- Holy crap.

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:04.910
Please tell me,
you're not going back there.

01:03:07.454 --> 01:03:08.539
Are you two nuts?

01:03:08.747 --> 01:03:09.957
Ty' has a plan.

01:03:10.249 --> 01:03:11.667
To do what,
get yourselves killed?

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.712
Look, all we need to do,
is lure that asshole back to the house.

01:03:15.963 --> 01:03:17.339
Tyler believes that seeing Eric

01:03:17.422 --> 01:03:19.716
will make Ellen realize,
that she's haunting the wrong guy.

01:03:20.425 --> 01:03:22.094
Okay, let's say this works.

01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:23.554
In light of what happened
to Mort..

01:03:23.679 --> 01:03:25.097
how do you stop her from killing
Eric?

01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:26.431
Good question babe.

01:03:26.849 --> 01:03:29.560
The way I see it...
that's his problem.

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.456
- Hold it.
- Oh come on girl, you used to run circles round me.

01:03:51.707 --> 01:03:52.791
Give me a break,
will ya.

01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:55.002
With all the crap we've had
going on lately

01:03:55.085 --> 01:03:56.837
jogging's been the last thing
on our minds.

01:03:57.838 --> 01:03:59.256
Yeah well, truth be told,

01:04:00.174 --> 01:04:01.842
I could use a breather myself.

01:04:03.468 --> 01:04:05.679
Oh... it's a text from Tyler.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.099
Uh, he says the audition was
a huge waste of time

01:04:09.183 --> 01:04:11.101
and he's much rather be jogging
with us instead.

01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:13.478
Bummer, is he at the apartment?

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:15.564
No, he's at Costco.

01:04:15.898 --> 01:04:17.649
Says he'll meet us at us
at Jerry's Delhi at one.

01:04:18.025 --> 01:04:19.526
Sweet.

01:04:20.527 --> 01:04:22.654
He also says,
"don't forget to shower"

01:04:23.488 --> 01:04:24.531
"but not together".

01:04:25.574 --> 01:04:27.075
Ain't gonna touch that one.

01:04:29.411 --> 01:04:31.038
What time do you think Heather
will be done with her shoot?

01:04:31.288 --> 01:04:32.873
Hard to say,
could be kind of late.

01:04:32.998 --> 01:04:35.209
What time are you and Tyler heading out tomorrow?

01:04:35.834 --> 01:04:37.127
I'd say no later than noon.

01:04:37.628 --> 01:04:38.837
Ah, I wish you could
stay longer.

01:04:39.421 --> 01:04:42.758
Me too and listen, we really appreciate
you letting us stay at your place.

01:04:42.841 --> 01:04:44.927
- Hey you'd do the same thing for us.
- Hmm.

01:04:45.093 --> 01:04:47.054
I just wish you didn't
have to go back to that damn house.

01:04:48.597 --> 01:04:50.641
Last one to the bench
buys lunch.

01:04:51.225 --> 01:04:52.267
Hey!

01:04:56.605 --> 01:04:58.982
Cheater.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.697
You do understand why
we have to go back there, right?

01:05:06.406 --> 01:05:07.991
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
I have to like it.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.828
Believe me, I'm not a hundred
percent sold on Tyler's plan either.

01:05:11.995 --> 01:05:14.289
But right now,
it looks like our best option.

01:05:16.667 --> 01:05:17.709
Bobby.

01:05:18.502 --> 01:05:20.212
A man died in our house.

01:05:20.295 --> 01:05:22.631
I know,
but are you absolutely sure

01:05:22.714 --> 01:05:25.884
it was Ellen, I mean who's
to say it wasn't an intruder.

01:05:25.968 --> 01:05:27.302
It was her.

01:05:28.554 --> 01:05:29.972
Look, we just don't want
to lose you too.

01:05:31.849 --> 01:05:32.891
Not going to happen.

01:05:36.144 --> 01:05:38.814
Okay, if you're bound and
determined to go through with it,

01:05:38.939 --> 01:05:40.482
then please reconsider
my offer.

01:05:40.774 --> 01:05:42.651
Bobby, you know
how I feel about guns.

01:05:42.734 --> 01:05:45.237
- Besides neither of us--
- Girl, why are you being so stubborn?

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.531
I'm not, it's just... I...

01:05:48.824 --> 01:05:49.992
Then do it for me.

01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:51.994
And Heather.

01:05:54.705 --> 01:05:58.709
Okay... I'll talk
to Tyler again tonight.

01:05:58.876 --> 01:06:00.002
Thank you.

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:03.589
I just, can't wait
for all of this to be over

01:06:03.672 --> 01:06:05.549
so we can go back to focusing
on our acting careers.

01:06:05.841 --> 01:06:06.967
Look, I hear you.

01:06:09.511 --> 01:06:11.054
- We should get back.
- Yup.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.559
Hey... you want to race?

01:06:16.018 --> 01:06:18.061
No way, I want
to quit while I'm ahead.

01:06:18.645 --> 01:06:19.897
- Chicken.
- Mm hmm.

01:06:32.451 --> 01:06:35.412
I have to admit, I'm a little bit
surprised to see you two back here.

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:39.082
Well it's our home detective,
and we've got every right to fight for it.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:42.377
Why do I have this knawing feeling in my
gut, that you two are up to something.

01:06:43.212 --> 01:06:45.547
I don't know Nick,
maybe it's something you ate.

01:06:46.048 --> 01:06:48.217
Yeah, you really should
lay off that fast food, buddy.

01:06:49.218 --> 01:06:52.012
I hope you guys aren't planning
on doing something stupid, like..

01:06:52.554 --> 01:06:55.182
perhaps making contact
with Eric Chambers.

01:06:55.807 --> 01:06:57.392
- No...
- Don't know what you're talking about...

01:06:57.476 --> 01:06:59.520
Like you said,
he's a really bad dude, so...

01:07:02.481 --> 01:07:04.942
By the way, even though he
signed off on the intruder theory

01:07:05.025 --> 01:07:07.027
the D.A might still want
to talk to you, at some point

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.987
so, keep us apprised
of your whereabouts.

01:07:09.154 --> 01:07:10.614
Alright, will do.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.124
You're sure you want
to go through with this?

01:07:22.543 --> 01:07:23.877
I don't think we have a choice.

01:07:32.678 --> 01:07:35.931
Hey
Betty, give me another.

01:07:38.058 --> 01:07:39.476
I don't think so, slick.

01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:42.229
You're tab's already
out of control.

01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:45.065
Come on doll,
you know I'm good for it.

01:07:45.649 --> 01:07:47.359
When's the last time
you worked?

01:07:47.609 --> 01:07:50.612
A while ago, but look I've got
a big job coming up next week.

01:07:50.696 --> 01:07:51.947
I'll pay you on Friday.

01:07:52.614 --> 01:07:53.824
The entire tab?

01:07:54.199 --> 01:07:55.742
Every cent.

01:07:56.785 --> 01:07:59.746
Okay... but if you let me down.

01:08:00.372 --> 01:08:04.126
I'll 86 your ass faster than
a hooker at a truck stop.

01:08:04.835 --> 01:08:07.004
Alright, no need for drama.

01:08:17.096 --> 01:08:18.557
- Thanks sugar.
- Uh huh.

01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.685
- What'll it be hun?
- Glass of wine.

01:08:21.768 --> 01:08:23.312
- House will do.
- White or red?

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:25.731
- White please.
- You got it.

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:31.862
May I help you?

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:36.033
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to stare.

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.911
Not used to seeing a woman like
you, in a place like this.

01:08:39.912 --> 01:08:40.953
Woman like me?

01:08:41.913 --> 01:08:44.875
What I meant to say was,
a classy and attractive woman like you.

01:08:46.126 --> 01:08:49.212
Ah... bet you say that to anyone
with tits.

01:08:52.381 --> 01:08:55.385
Honey... watch out
for this one.

01:09:01.517 --> 01:09:03.143
I haven't seen you around
before, are you new in town?

01:09:04.185 --> 01:09:06.313
I've been here a while,
I just don't get out much.

01:09:07.856 --> 01:09:08.982
So what brings you out tonight?

01:09:09.983 --> 01:09:13.362
Well if you must know, I just booted
my no good boyfriend out of the house

01:09:14.904 --> 01:09:16.240
and I'm in the mood
to celebrate.

01:09:17.032 --> 01:09:19.117
Are you now...
I'm Eric.

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:22.453
Dianna.

01:09:25.624 --> 01:09:27.084
I got to tell you Eric,

01:09:27.667 --> 01:09:29.627
I haven't laughed
like this in a long time.

01:09:30.587 --> 01:09:31.880
You're a real fun guy.

01:09:33.215 --> 01:09:34.424
In more ways
than you know, baby.

01:09:35.759 --> 01:09:38.386
But it's getting kinda late,
I should go home.

01:09:39.513 --> 01:09:41.723
Come one now,
I thought you wanted to celebrate.

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:44.600
I do but... uh look.

01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:47.354
I've already had one D.U.I

01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:49.564
I can't risk getting another.

01:09:51.108 --> 01:09:52.192
I hear you doll.

01:09:52.526 --> 01:09:54.486
And I've got the perfect
solution to that problem.

01:09:55.445 --> 01:09:56.530
Which is?

01:09:57.364 --> 01:09:59.449
Got any booze at your place?

01:10:01.118 --> 01:10:02.494
Whoa cowboy.

01:10:02.911 --> 01:10:04.246
I barely know you.

01:10:04.788 --> 01:10:07.958
Hey... we'll have a few drinks,
a few laughs.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.668
And I'll go home.

01:10:19.136 --> 01:10:20.846
Wasn't someone murdered
on this street last week?

01:10:22.055 --> 01:10:23.891
Yeah, it was only
four houses down.

01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:25.893
Tragic event.

01:10:27.102 --> 01:10:29.313
Uh, so make yourself at home.

01:10:29.897 --> 01:10:31.273
I'm going to get into something
more comfortable.

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:32.774
You got it, doll.

01:11:07.809 --> 01:11:10.479
Don't tell me,
the no good boyfriend?

01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:12.022
Guess again asshole.

01:11:13.106 --> 01:11:14.900
Alright man,
just stay cool.

01:11:15.442 --> 01:11:16.568
I will if you will.

01:11:21.782 --> 01:11:23.825
What the hell is this,
some kind of a shakedown?

01:11:24.201 --> 01:11:25.953
- We just want to talk.
- About what?

01:11:26.703 --> 01:11:28.163
About what you did to Ellen.

01:11:28.622 --> 01:11:30.791
Ellen Pendleton,
I didn't do nothing to her.

01:11:30.999 --> 01:11:32.042
Yeah you sure did.

01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:35.045
You killed that poor girl,
and then disposed of her body.

01:11:35.337 --> 01:11:38.340
Hold on now, the cops just
told me she's back in town.

01:11:38.882 --> 01:11:41.343
- So I couldn't have killed her.
- Oh she's back alright.

01:11:42.302 --> 01:11:44.054
Just not how you think.

01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:47.933
Ellen, you want to come out
here, and meet the real Eric?

01:11:49.226 --> 01:11:52.604
Ellen, here's your chance to get
even with the guy who murdered you.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.025
You guys are bat shit crazy.

01:11:57.109 --> 01:11:59.152
- Tyler!
- Let her go.

01:12:00.279 --> 01:12:03.240
Put it down man, or I'll cut
her, I'm serious I'll do it!

01:12:03.407 --> 01:12:06.410
- Tyler.
- Okay.

01:12:13.166 --> 01:12:14.835
Now back away.

01:12:19.673 --> 01:12:21.633
- Please.
- I take it back.

01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:23.343
You aren't crazy.

01:12:24.386 --> 01:12:25.470
You're just stupid.

01:12:40.527 --> 01:12:42.654
Guess I could make it look like
a home invasion.

01:12:43.572 --> 01:12:45.699
- Yeah...
- that would work.

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:49.077
Now I just have to decide
whether to shoot ya,

01:12:49.953 --> 01:12:51.330
or cut your throats.

01:12:55.083 --> 01:12:56.877
Look we're not going to say
anything to anyone.

01:12:58.504 --> 01:13:00.422
I'm going to make
damn sure of that.

01:13:05.385 --> 01:13:06.512
What a shame.

01:13:07.346 --> 01:13:09.389
I was looking forward
to having some fun with you.

01:13:12.768 --> 01:13:14.228
Maybe I still can.

01:13:16.355 --> 01:13:17.856
- I'd rather be dead.
- Look.

01:13:18.607 --> 01:13:21.193
If you're just going to kill us,
why not tell us what happened to Ellen.

01:13:23.654 --> 01:13:25.113
Sure, why not.

01:13:26.114 --> 01:13:28.283
- Dead people can't talk, right?
- Yeah.

01:13:29.243 --> 01:13:30.327
You'd be surprised.

01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:35.165
Well... it so happens that Ellen
was my first kill.

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:37.292
There were others?

01:13:38.085 --> 01:13:40.379
Oh yeah... seven.

01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:41.713
To be exact.

01:13:42.631 --> 01:13:44.049
But you know what?

01:13:44.925 --> 01:13:46.093
The first one.

01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:48.804
Was by far the sweetest.

01:13:48.887 --> 01:13:50.597
Get your filthy hands
off of her.

01:13:54.393 --> 01:13:56.812
The stupid bitch tried
to dump me.

01:13:57.688 --> 01:13:59.356
Like I was
going to let that happen.

01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:01.775
Come on man,
let's just talk about this, okay?

01:14:04.194 --> 01:14:05.737
She begged me not to kill her.

01:14:07.656 --> 01:14:09.116
But the more she begged,

01:14:09.324 --> 01:14:12.411
- the more I wanted to choke the life out of her--
- Eric stop!

01:14:12.536 --> 01:14:16.707
I'll give you anything you want,
I'll give you this goddam house, just stop!

01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:24.631
But, since I got to make
this look like a home invasion,

01:14:25.632 --> 01:14:27.676
it just makes more sense
to shoot ya.

01:14:33.223 --> 01:14:35.267
These eight... women you killed.

01:14:36.727 --> 01:14:38.270
How did you dispose
of their bodies?

01:14:41.106 --> 01:14:42.941
Buried them down the road
from my uncles house.

01:14:44.318 --> 01:14:45.777
Ellen got the nicest spot
though.

01:14:47.029 --> 01:14:48.864
Right under an old
scrub oak tree.

01:14:50.741 --> 01:14:52.284
Now that I
got that off my chest,

01:14:52.743 --> 01:14:53.994
it's time for you two to die.

01:14:58.207 --> 01:14:59.249
Eric.

01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:01.210
Is there someone else here?

01:15:01.793 --> 01:15:04.880
Maybe, why don't you
go take a look.

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:08.133
I believe I will.

01:15:09.593 --> 01:15:10.636
Don't go nowhere.

01:15:13.514 --> 01:15:16.600
Come out, come out,
where ever you are.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.063
Hurry up.

01:15:21.146 --> 01:15:22.397
I know you're here somewhere.

01:15:25.192 --> 01:15:26.527
I'm gonna find you
sooner or later.

01:15:27.694 --> 01:15:29.613
So you might as well
show yourself.

01:15:31.949 --> 01:15:33.033
Hello.

01:15:50.634 --> 01:15:51.677
Eric.

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:54.555
Really starting to piss me off!

01:16:07.693 --> 01:16:10.863
I don't know what kind of goddam game
you're playing, but I've had enough of it.

01:16:11.405 --> 01:16:12.447
Eric.

01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:16.451
Shit! Ellen?

01:16:18.287 --> 01:16:19.371
Gunshots.

01:16:19.955 --> 01:16:22.082
You're supposed to be dead
goddam it.

01:16:39.224 --> 01:16:41.018
Oh no.

01:16:46.148 --> 01:16:47.524
Tyler, Tyler.

01:16:50.527 --> 01:16:51.737
Ellen please don't.

01:16:53.447 --> 01:16:54.698
He had nothing
to do with your death.

01:17:05.459 --> 01:17:07.211
Please.

01:17:53.632 --> 01:17:55.384
Be at peace.

01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:17.906
Thanks to the information
you were able to extract from Eric.

01:18:18.198 --> 01:18:20.242
We already found
five of the eight bodies,

01:18:20.325 --> 01:18:21.702
including Ellen's.

01:18:21.785 --> 01:18:23.662
It's only a matter of time
before we find the other three.

01:18:24.162 --> 01:18:26.915
- Well at least in will bring closure to their families.
- Indeed.

01:18:27.583 --> 01:18:29.877
Okay, well we'll let you folks
get back to what you were doing.

01:18:30.043 --> 01:18:32.462
- Alright, hey thanks for everything detective.
- You folks take care.

01:18:42.139 --> 01:18:44.474
Notice how pleasant it's been
round here the past few nights.

01:18:45.517 --> 01:18:47.686
It's been pretty nice not having
to sleep with one eye open.

01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:52.774
Another unknow caller.

01:18:54.484 --> 01:18:55.527
Should I answer it?

01:18:55.736 --> 01:18:58.572
Yeah there's no sense in being
paranoid, go ahead put it on speaker.

01:19:00.991 --> 01:19:02.117
Hello.

01:19:03.368 --> 01:19:04.411
Hello Dianna.

01:19:05.495 --> 01:19:07.873
Dianna, I'm not...

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:11.627
Who is this?

01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:14.713
You don't recognize my voice?

01:19:15.964 --> 01:19:18.800
It's me... Eric.

01:19:21.512 --> 01:19:24.139
- Eric Chambers?
- Yes.

01:19:26.141 --> 01:19:29.061
We have some
unfinished business, Dianna.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.646
See you soon.
