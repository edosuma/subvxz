WEBVTT

00:09.880 --> 00:10.881
God!

00:14.720 --> 00:15.767
Damn it.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.606
Again?

00:18.080 --> 00:19.730
Let me ask you something, Richard.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.245
You sure it's not urine,

00:21.320 --> 00:23.687
and you're not just wetting the bed?

00:23.760 --> 00:25.364
Yeah, I'm sure. It's not.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.885
It's just sweat.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.531
Well, then the medical
term for what you have

00:29.600 --> 00:31.443
is "night sweats."

00:31.520 --> 00:32.567
Okay.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.927
But night sweats can be a precursor
to bed-wetting,

00:35.000 --> 00:36.843
and that is very serious.

00:37.640 --> 00:38.641
How serious?

00:38.720 --> 00:40.563
Like, uh, cancer?

00:40.640 --> 00:42.642
No! It's embarrassing.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.166
I mean, you're a grown man, Richard.
Come on.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.401
That's what children do.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.960
But I'm not wetting the bed.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.166
Yet!

00:50.240 --> 00:52.004
How's your stress level been?

00:52.080 --> 00:54.082
Uh, it's gotten worse. Um...

00:54.160 --> 00:57.289
I have to get a working beta of my platform
ready in time for January.

00:57.360 --> 01:00.762
I just took money from a guy
who is a nightmare.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.080
I hired six new people.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.561
We're going to have to spend
a ton of money on new offices.

01:04.640 --> 01:08.565
It's like every second
there is a new issue that I have to solve.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.927
I am stressed as hell.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.924
Richard, currently, your
stress level is here.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.729
And that's night sweats level.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.361
Got it? Now, if you're not careful
and you let it go up...

01:20.080 --> 01:21.081
Bed-wetting.

01:33.680 --> 01:34.886
I love these walls.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.962
You know what it is? They're exposed brick.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.486
Why would anyone ever hide brick?

01:39.560 --> 01:41.324
Did you see the conference nook?

01:41.600 --> 01:43.967
Just think of the conferences
we could have in this nook.

01:44.080 --> 01:47.527
Yeah. But, I mean, this is
really expensive.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.728
So, um, what did the doctor say?

01:49.880 --> 01:53.601
Uh... It's nothing.
It's just stress-related night sweats.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.569
- I'll be fine.
- That's good to hear.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.529
- Are you relieved?
- I would have been

01:57.600 --> 01:59.489
if that idiot hadn't mentioned something

01:59.560 --> 02:02.291
about how it can lead to, uh, bed-wetting.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.570
I'm just trying not to think about it.

02:04.640 --> 02:07.041
Good. Don't. Definitely.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.808
Because just thinking about it would probably
stress you out enough to make it happen...

02:11.880 --> 02:13.609
Stop! Would you... Don't say "stress."

02:13.680 --> 02:16.650
I just said that I was trying not to
think about it.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.849
Well, Richard, personal management
is a big part of being a CEO.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.048
You think working here might help?

02:22.160 --> 02:25.687
Actually, yeah. I think it would.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.290
But, um, can we afford it?

02:27.360 --> 02:29.647
Well, this is an investment
in your mental health.

02:29.720 --> 02:33.008
Richard, I mean, can you put a dollar value
on not wetting your bed?

02:33.080 --> 02:34.491
Don't...

02:34.560 --> 02:36.562
If you want this, Richard,
even with the money we wasted

02:36.640 --> 02:39.769
on swag and billboards,
I think I can make the numbers work.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.171
It's your call.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.766
Hey, guys. Um, this is Yelena.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.561
She got off the elevator at the wrong floor

02:47.640 --> 02:49.927
because her modeling agency is upstairs.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.965
- Richard?
- Yeah?

02:52.400 --> 02:53.401
Please?

02:54.400 --> 02:57.165
Primarily for other reasons, but, yes!

02:57.280 --> 02:59.521
Yeah, sure. We're gonna take it.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.682
- We're taking it.
- Take...

03:01.760 --> 03:03.967
- I'm gonna hug you.
- No.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.882
All right, this one's ready to go out
to the truck.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.968
Great. Take it out.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.366
Okay, you know what?
I said we should hire movers.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.601
I don't do this kind of stuff.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.284
I work with my mind, not with my hands.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.201
In Pakistan, we had servants who did this.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.965
It wasn't a big deal. We didn't pay them
very much, and they were very happy.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.204
I'll take out your box of tampons.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.805
It's good for the soul.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.605
Interesting pitch.

03:31.680 --> 03:36.368
I will admit, I have never heard
a Christian-oriented riff on dog-sharing.

03:37.320 --> 03:41.564
But Christianity is borderline illegal
in northern California.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.005
Also, how would you scale?

03:43.080 --> 03:47.130
Well, we could expand
from sharing dogs, to other types of pets.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.804
Pot-bellied pigs, ferrets...

03:48.880 --> 03:50.166
I'm gonna stop you right there.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.562
You do know that ferrets are illegal
in the state of California? Hmm?

03:54.120 --> 03:56.600
No? Well, then I suppose
you also don't know

03:56.680 --> 04:00.605
that pot-bellied pigs have been
wildly unfashionable since 2005.

04:01.320 --> 04:05.120
Owning a pot-bellied pig is frowned upon
almost as much as being a Christian.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.089
Thank you, gentlemen. Good day.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.526
Now technically,
I'm not passing on Dog Dammit.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.682
I'm just not saying yes.

04:16.760 --> 04:19.366
But who knows?
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.851
I don't have to tell you that.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.130
Richard, do you have a moment?

04:31.200 --> 04:32.964
I'd like to present you something.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.371
Okay, what's up?

04:37.680 --> 04:40.081
- What are you doing?
- Bowing.

04:40.200 --> 04:44.330
The Japanese have the most advanced
business culture in the world.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.767
I am showing you respect
by using their traditions.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.966
And traditionally,
you give a gift on important occasions,

04:50.040 --> 04:52.611
such as the graduating of an incubee.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.042
"Incubee"? Is that a word?

04:55.120 --> 04:57.327
Of course it is. One who's been incubated.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.882
The inhabitant of an incubator.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.645
Okay. Okay.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.610
- Now you bow.
- I'd really rather not.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.489
Richard, I need you to bow.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.851
- To the waist.
- To the waist?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.081
There.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.970
Now I hand this to you,

05:18.040 --> 05:21.203
and it is customary for
you to politely refuse,

05:21.280 --> 05:23.521
and weakly say that you are not worthy.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.489
Erlich, I really don't have time for this.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.403
- That's perfect. Here you go.
- Okay.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.005
Oh, wow.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.401
Japanese coin. Lowest denomination.

05:36.800 --> 05:37.926
Wow.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.406
Is this a kimono?

05:42.480 --> 05:45.529
- Well, try it on.
- Thank you, Erlich.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.486
Is it on?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.441
According to Google Translate, that means,

05:56.520 --> 05:57.601
"it has been an honor."

05:58.360 --> 05:59.725
Yeah, all right.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.689
Thank you. Thanks.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.570
I'm still packing up,
so I don't want to damage it.

06:04.640 --> 06:05.641
Uh-uh...

06:06.160 --> 06:07.764
Traditionally, it's rolled.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.287
Okay.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.441
Wikipedia.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.248
Thanks, Erlich. I'll get you something.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.801
Later.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.447
Oh, little kohai, you've
already given me a gift.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.282
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.124
Noah, from next door.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.407
Oh. Hey, uh, Richard.

06:36.640 --> 06:37.721
Moving out?

06:37.800 --> 06:40.007
Yeah, some of us are, sort of.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.651
Well, I'd be lying to say
I was sad to see you go.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.167
Okay. Heh.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.529
Nothing personal.
You seem like nice guys, just...

06:47.600 --> 06:50.126
Houses full of renters
aren't great for property values.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.486
Yeah, that makes sense.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.411
This neighborhood is mostly families.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.448
Okay. Well, we're moving out, so...

06:56.560 --> 06:58.085
People with pets, you know?

06:59.560 --> 07:01.767
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, good luck.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.684
- You too.
- What?

07:05.160 --> 07:06.969
- You, too.
- Mmm-hmm.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.521
- Hey, Richard?
- Oh, hey, Jared.

07:13.840 --> 07:17.561
Richard, the hosting company that was
going to be renting us server space

07:17.640 --> 07:19.130
just dropped their bid.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.931
Okay, well, let's just get servers
from some other provider.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.611
Well, I just contacted
five other web services companies,

07:24.680 --> 07:26.603
and they're all denying us.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.001
I think I know what might
be happening here.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.920
All of them, Rackspace, SoftLayer, Amazon,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.287
I mean, they can't afford to lose
Hooli's business.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.001
So, Gavin Belson can just pick up the phone
and make us radioactive

07:39.080 --> 07:41.048
to every single web-hosting service?

07:41.120 --> 07:42.485
It's how these guys operate.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.801
I mean, when Bill Gates
got married on Lanai,

07:44.880 --> 07:47.326
he rented every helicopter
on the Hawaiian islands

07:47.400 --> 07:49.607
so that paparazzi
couldn't use them to fly over.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.610
Although in that case, it was a positive,

07:51.680 --> 07:54.524
because now you can imagine that wedding
however you want.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.971
- What?
- Jared, our entire platform is web-based.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.809
We need servers for that.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.564
What the fuck are we going to do?

08:01.840 --> 08:05.447
I know what the fuck we're going to do.
But you're not going to like it.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.725
We build our own servers.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.925
Gilfoyle, servers are
essentially a utility.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.766
I mean, you wouldn't dig a well for water,
or build a generator for power.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.889
I think we should dig our own well,
and build our own generator.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.010
I also think we should store a year's worth
of food and ammunition in a blast cellar.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.445
But we don't.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.488
So good luck when the shit hits the fan.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.842
Look, Richard, we're about precision,

08:28.920 --> 08:32.447
about shaving yoctoseconds off latency
at every layer in the stack.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.921
If we rent from a public cloud,

08:35.000 --> 08:39.210
we're using servers that are, by
definition, generic and unpredictable.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.169
Yeah, but we're already
up against a serious deadline.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.925
I mean, how long is building our
own servers going to set us back?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.809
If I busted my ass,

08:46.960 --> 08:49.361
I could stand them up inside a week

08:49.440 --> 08:50.441
right here in the house.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.362
Look, Richard, truth is,

08:56.040 --> 08:57.724
this is a huge positive.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.810
I tried running the platform
on my old Bitcoin rig.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.803
At 5,200 gigaflops,

09:02.880 --> 09:08.125
your algorithm flies 800 times faster
on GPUs compared to normal CPUs.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.210
No host could match the config that I build
here in the house.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.601
Oh, and also, we don't
seem to have a choice.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.884
But that would cost a ton.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.928
And we don't have that kind of money
just lying around.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.403
It seems as though we do
have that kind of money just lying around.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.403
But that's for the office space.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.448
- Was it?
- No, no, no, no!

09:27.520 --> 09:29.090
Jared, we already signed the lease.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.128
It's too late, right?
We can't break a lease.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.043
I mean, we haven't given
them the check yet.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.407
- Here it is.
- I could go mail it right now.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.926
In this market, they could
probably find another tenant in a day.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.411
I doubt there would be an issue.

09:39.480 --> 09:42.290
Fuck! Richard, please?

09:43.160 --> 09:45.970
It's servers or offices, Richard.
We can't afford both.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.127
Damn it. I don't know what to do.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.567
Well, then it's a good thing...

09:52.720 --> 09:54.131
It's a good thing that I'm here, isn't it?

09:54.640 --> 09:58.122
As much as I hate to agree with Gilfoyle,
he's right.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.605
You have but one option.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.081
Stay here and build the servers.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.521
Are you sure?

10:03.600 --> 10:08.083
Because I've got Carla and five other
coders starting over the next few weeks.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.811
Well, it's going to get a little
cozy in here, but I'll endure,

10:11.360 --> 10:12.361
for your sake.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.245
What about all your other "incubees"?

10:15.640 --> 10:18.246
I've heard quite a few exciting pitches
over the last week,

10:18.320 --> 10:22.962
but I'll be forced to forgo those
opportunities because of your mediocrity.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.964
You see, Richard,
when I invited you into my incubator,

10:27.040 --> 10:29.964
I promised to get you ready
for the outside world.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.280
But I failed to do that.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.610
I wouldn't trust you out there in the
real world as far as I could throw you.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.650
And, to be honest, I could probably throw
you all the way across the front yard.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.611
Okay, but I don't want to stay here.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.007
- I don't want you to either, Richard.
- Okay.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.487
So it's agreed. Welcome home, fellas.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.083
Should we smoke some pot to celebrate?

10:55.320 --> 10:56.401
Gavin, thank you for coming.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.643
I am certain that once you witness
firsthand what Mr. Bighetti is up to,

10:59.760 --> 11:02.331
you will see that he is
worthless around here.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.970
Worth is a relative thing.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.163
Yes, but worthlessness is not.
It is absolute.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.608
People add value to this company
in many different ways.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.409
Of course, but look at this.

11:12.480 --> 11:16.690
Bighetti has his team wasting
valuable resources on a potato cannon.

11:16.760 --> 11:20.082
Five, four, three, two, one.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.441
Fire!

11:24.280 --> 11:25.281
Jesus!

11:27.320 --> 11:29.561
You see what your brightest minds
are being wasted on?

11:29.640 --> 11:30.687
Launching potatoes.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.330
- What the fuck?
- Sorry.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.922
Perhaps they're developing it
as a non-lethal form of crowd control.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.048
I actually think that
it could kill somebody.

11:38.120 --> 11:42.762
But even so, compared to what my team
has accomplished in a matter of days...

11:42.840 --> 11:44.285
Come here, I want you to meet somebody.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.203
All right, I've got a
good feeling about this one.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.362
One more time. Here we go.
Everybody ready? Fire!

11:50.120 --> 11:53.090
Oh, shit! You okay? Sorry. Shit.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.802
This is Kiko.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.771
Kiko was rescued after a Nicaraguan
landmine severed both his arms.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.326
My team, using technology developed
at Somerville,

12:02.400 --> 12:06.325
was able to devise an array of sensors
that can non-invasively detect signals

12:06.400 --> 12:08.880
from the neurons in the motor cortex
of the brain.

12:11.200 --> 12:15.205
So without surgery, we have given Kiko
the gift of a usable prosthetic appendage.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.647
What's he doing?

12:21.920 --> 12:25.129
What Kiko chooses to do with the technology
is not important.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.328
What's important here is that, um,

12:27.400 --> 12:30.006
in spite of what it may seem like
on the surface,

12:30.080 --> 12:33.687
building a device that is capable of this

12:33.800 --> 12:36.167
is a remarkable scientific achievement.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.607
And what you're looking at is really
a testament

12:38.680 --> 12:41.729
to my team and to my leadership,
and I feel that...

12:46.200 --> 12:49.283
I'm going to have to insist that Bighetti
be removed if I continue here.

12:49.360 --> 12:54.241
Davis, there are a lot of forces at work here.
There's a lot at play that you are not privy to.

12:54.320 --> 12:57.085
Please do not question
how I choose to run my company.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.447
Of course, I just have to think
that both of our interests

12:59.520 --> 13:01.841
would be better served
if Bighetti was not...

13:02.520 --> 13:03.601
What is he doing now?

13:05.760 --> 13:07.364
Oh, God.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.563
Again, I have to stress that what the
monkey chooses to do with the technology

13:10.640 --> 13:12.881
is not necessarily
an indictment of the technology itself.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.610
Gavin, please!

13:19.120 --> 13:23.728
Okay. So I'll put 80 GPUs on racks
against that wall.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.808
We'll have three
main cabinets in the center.

13:25.880 --> 13:29.965
I'll try and pull 220-volt power from
the washer-dryer for all the cooling units.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.801
- So you'll need this entire space then?
- Yep.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.723
All right. I'll move my things.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.686
- What?
- It's okay.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.762
I'll have it all in my car in no time.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.891
Wait, Jared, uh, are you living here?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.365
In the garage?

13:45.440 --> 13:48.011
Indeed I am. High on the hog.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.681
Jesus Christ, poor fucker.
Sleeping out there with the rodents.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.923
Hey, I keep a clean garage.
There are no rodents out there.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.247
How can you guarantee
there are no rodents living there

13:58.360 --> 14:00.124
when you didn't even know Jared
was living there?

14:00.200 --> 14:03.682
I need all rodents and Jareds
out of the garage. I need the space.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.603
Do we have any extra power strips?

14:05.680 --> 14:07.489
There's not a lot of outlets out there.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.962
There are a lot of
dudes playing Foosball, loudly.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.485
I'll take care of that. Say no more.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.561
Jian Yang!

14:14.440 --> 14:17.410
I need all of your guys out of there,
and the Foosball table.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.724
Those not my guys.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.526
But they're always around. Who are they?

14:23.600 --> 14:25.329
Friends of friends.

14:26.280 --> 14:29.124
They're friends of your... Mother fuck!

14:30.720 --> 14:34.611
Guys, look, Jared gave up
his own apartment so he could

14:34.680 --> 14:38.321
take less salary and save the
company money. I mean...

14:39.200 --> 14:41.328
Erlich, can he just stay here?

14:41.480 --> 14:44.484
Once again, because of your poor
managerial skills,

14:44.600 --> 14:46.728
I've been hoisted upon my own petard.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.965
Yes, he can stay here.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.010
Great. So, which room can he stay in?

14:52.160 --> 14:55.289
Well, he's not staying in mine.
I sleep dick-up.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.091
- Okay, so then...
- Uh... Not it.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.761
Okay.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.161
- Not a chance in hell.
- All right.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.001
Fuck.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.963
Oh, shit.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.327
Morning, roomie. I made you a half-caff.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.203
Oh... Richard.

15:40.320 --> 15:43.608
Yeah, I sweated through my sheets again.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.444
You sweated? You sure you didn't...

15:45.520 --> 15:47.921
Yes, I'm sure. It's just sweat, so...

15:48.040 --> 15:51.203
Do you think maybe
you sweat from your urethra?

15:51.320 --> 15:52.765
No, I didn't sweat through my...

15:52.840 --> 15:54.126
You know what? Let's not talk about it.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.488
Because talking about it
will only exacerbate...

15:57.600 --> 15:59.045
- Stop.
- Yeah.

15:59.880 --> 16:03.726
Hey, um...
When did you learn to speak German?

16:03.840 --> 16:05.729
What? I don't speak German.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.846
- You sure?
- Yeah.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.650
- All this hardware for $70,000?
- Yep.

16:14.720 --> 16:15.721
Nice work.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.406
Oh, look at all this stuff.

16:17.480 --> 16:20.563
Oh, is that a Radeon 7850?
We're using these, huh?

16:20.640 --> 16:21.801
There's no "we."

16:21.880 --> 16:23.644
You don't do this kind of work, remember?

16:23.720 --> 16:25.688
You make a living with your mind,
not your hands.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.364
- No, no, no...
- So don't touch.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.169
You misunderstood me. I like hardware.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.447
I made my own computer when I was nine.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.242
From scratch or kit?

16:34.360 --> 16:35.930
It was from a kit, but I did my own mods.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.923
- That's what I thought.
- I was nine.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.571
I'm sure you were great
at finger-painting, also, Dinesh.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.405
Richard is the CEO. He
delegated this to me.

16:43.520 --> 16:46.000
Why don't you go inside
and write some princess code?

16:46.080 --> 16:48.367
Leave the hardware up to us servants.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.408
All right, I got the crimper
and some heat shrink.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.051
- Great.
- Wait, she can help but not me?

16:53.120 --> 16:54.565
That's right.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.808
Can I help? Please?

16:57.480 --> 16:58.766
Mmm...

16:59.000 --> 17:00.445
- No.
- I said...

17:00.520 --> 17:01.806
Richard, you have to let me help him.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.406
Dinesh, you have to hack away
on the front end of the build anyway.

17:04.480 --> 17:07.131
- So why don't you...
- Excuse me?

17:07.480 --> 17:09.209
- Excuse me?
- This is bullshit.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.726
- Oh, hey, Noah.
- I thought you guys were moving out?

17:11.839 --> 17:13.604
But it looks like you're moving back in.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.008
Well, yeah, it's a little
complicated, but...

17:16.079 --> 17:17.888
What are you guys doing in there?

17:17.960 --> 17:20.804
What, you building some kind of computer?

17:20.920 --> 17:25.130
Well, more of a server-data center.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.680
It's actually pretty interesting,
if you're into that sort of stuff.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.767
- Hello?
- Stop talking immediately!

17:30.840 --> 17:31.966
Come inside.

17:32.280 --> 17:35.409
Don't look at me. Don't look at me!
Don't look at me.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.450
Just tell him that you shit your pants
and you have weak knees.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.609
What were you doing out there?

17:41.680 --> 17:43.250
Why were you talking to that person?

17:43.320 --> 17:45.800
'Cause he lives next door.
I was just being neighborly.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.848
Neighborly? First of
all, that's not a word.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.486
Second of all,
you don't talk to the neighbors, ever.

17:50.560 --> 17:51.891
In fact, don't talk to anybody.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.689
It's no one's business what we do here.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.889
Why would anyone care
what goes on in here?

17:55.960 --> 17:58.406
'Cause we're not zoned for business,
obviously.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.687
What do you mean
we're not zoned for business?

18:00.760 --> 18:03.730
I just moved my entire business here!

18:03.800 --> 18:05.848
You just keep your mouth shut
and everything will be fine.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.322
You talked me into staying here even though
you knew we were breaking the law?

18:09.440 --> 18:12.125
I'm sorry, Erlich, but I'm pissed.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.043
- You're pissed at me?
- Yeah.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.929
- I should be pissed at you.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.081
You know why?

18:17.200 --> 18:20.090
Because when one is given a parting gift
and one never parts,

18:20.200 --> 18:23.602
shouldn't one return the said gift?
Isn't that what decorum would dictate?

18:23.680 --> 18:25.170
This is about the kimono?

18:25.240 --> 18:28.323
Okay, I will give it back to you right now,
gladly.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.050
Now I'm really pissed.

18:30.120 --> 18:33.124
Because if one appreciated a gift
of such magnitude,

18:33.200 --> 18:36.488
then one would put up more of a fight
before returning it, wouldn't one?

18:38.720 --> 18:39.721
Okay.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.280
A complaint from a neighbor

18:42.360 --> 18:44.442
to the Department of
Planning and Community Environment

18:44.560 --> 18:47.882
triggers an inspection,
which can lead to a citation, fines,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.770
or even the seizure
and impounding of our equipment.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.446
That gentleman next door
has the power to ruin us.

18:54.520 --> 18:55.521
Jesus.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.648
Richard, can I suggest you take it easy
on the Red Bulls?

18:59.720 --> 19:02.564
It's a diuretic, and given your issue...

19:03.600 --> 19:05.364
My issue?

19:05.840 --> 19:06.887
Oh, God.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.485
It's night sweats, Jared.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.689
Yes, well, regardless of what we've decided
on calling it,

19:11.760 --> 19:14.445
pounding caffeine and sugar
is not exactly going to help.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.171
But you know what might? Kegels.

19:17.560 --> 19:18.527
What?

19:18.600 --> 19:22.127
Kegels are a form of exercise
that strengthen the pelvic floor.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.248
Now, yes, it's most commonly used by women

19:24.320 --> 19:27.244
to recover control of their vaginal muscles
after childbirth.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.127
But it can really help,

19:30.200 --> 19:31.850
you know, "night sweats."

19:32.760 --> 19:33.966
Wow.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.044
Okay, we're not going to
talk about this anymore.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.565
I'm doing it right now.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.723
Clench, un-clench, clench...

19:40.840 --> 19:42.569
Stop.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.926
You hear that?

19:45.480 --> 19:47.130
Hey. HEY-

19:47.200 --> 19:49.123
Stop it. Hey, turn the music down.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.531
Turn it off. We have neighbors.

19:50.600 --> 19:51.567
Are you kidding me?

19:51.640 --> 19:55.884
Look, Gilfoyle, you said that you would
have all the servers up and running.

19:55.960 --> 19:59.089
And we're already a week behind. Don't you
think you should be doing that instead of,

19:59.160 --> 20:00.525
you know, getting high on the job?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.967
I'm not getting high on the job.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.530
I'm getting high at home.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.324
I live here, remember?

20:06.400 --> 20:08.243
Right, okay, fair enough. Fair enough.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.288
But Carla doesn't. These guys don't.

20:11.120 --> 20:14.329
I'm having them over as guests, at my home.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.044
If that's okay with you, Richard.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.361
Wait. This is your home?

20:18.960 --> 20:21.042
- Yes.
- So you live in the workplace.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.088
But you also work from home.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.645
That must be really confusing for you.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.644
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.609
That's kind of the...

20:33.640 --> 20:36.291
Does it look dark to you guys?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.251
', GUYS-

20:43.320 --> 20:44.526
Dude, what the fuck?

20:44.680 --> 20:46.125
The power's out.

20:47.760 --> 20:51.685
Okay, fine.
I wanted to set up one GPU, just one,

20:51.760 --> 20:55.560
and so I turned the power on
and the whole system lit up. And...

20:55.640 --> 20:57.369
Yeah, it did, you dick.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.160
'Cause I bypassed the meter to save money
and went directly to the feed

21:00.240 --> 21:01.571
without the UPS ready.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.564
That surge just fragged
the whole fucking system.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.841
Holy shit.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.285
What the hell did you guys do?

21:12.760 --> 21:15.047
The power in the whole block is down.

21:15.320 --> 21:16.321
Great.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.528
What the...

21:19.600 --> 21:20.840
Oh, God. Look who it is.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.164
We need to talk, guys.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.411
Hold on a sec.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.171
Noah, whatever you're going to say,
just say it from there.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.241
We can hear you.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.642
If you didn't have so many cars parked
here, maybe I could get through.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.044
He's really going to go all the way around?

21:35.880 --> 21:37.325
That's a long ways.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.124
- Hold on.
- Jesus Christ!

21:39.200 --> 21:41.043
Save some battery, for Christ's sake!

21:41.160 --> 21:42.366
Just a sec.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.521
Just yell it!

21:43.600 --> 21:45.728
It's okay, Noah, we get it.
You can say it from there.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.644
You're gonna report us
to the city inspector, right?

21:48.720 --> 21:49.721
Jesus!

21:50.560 --> 21:51.800
Guess what?

21:51.880 --> 21:53.882
I'm reporting you to the city inspector.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.001
Right.

21:55.760 --> 21:56.841
Okay.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.409
Zoning codes are very clear.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.090
This neighborhood is for families, pets.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.844
Holy shit.

22:32.440 --> 22:36.570
Come here, Agamemnon.
Come here, boy. Yeah.

22:37.160 --> 22:40.369
Who's a good boy? Yeah, you're a good boy.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.084
Come here, Agamemnon.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.288
Did that blackout scare you, Agamemnon?

22:46.160 --> 22:47.161
Who's a good boy?

22:47.320 --> 22:49.721
Who's a good boy? Yeah.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.803
- Oh, yeah.
- Holy shit.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.770
Yeah. Daddy loves you, Daddy loves you.

22:59.480 --> 23:00.481
Erlich?

23:02.800 --> 23:04.165
- What is it?
- Hey, um...

23:04.320 --> 23:05.765
I'm sorry I didn't give
you back the kimono,

23:05.840 --> 23:07.808
or resist giving you back the kimono,
or whatever it was.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.851
But I have a gift that
might make it up to you.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.168
- Is that what I think it is?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.241
Oh, boy.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.490
It is 4:00 in the morning! What the...

23:26.280 --> 23:27.805
Why are you both wearing kimonos?

23:27.880 --> 23:32.249
Noah, are you familiar with
the California Fish and Game Code,

23:32.320 --> 23:35.244
section 2116-2126,

23:35.320 --> 23:39.006
with regard to
the possession and harboring of ferrets?

23:40.640 --> 23:42.324
- Oh, God.
- Oh, yeah.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.528
Those little shits are illegal.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.564
Erlich, please, don't. I'll do anything.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.005
Oh, yeah, you will.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.923
We are here to stay,
and you're going to keep that

23:51.000 --> 23:54.368
bearded little hole
in the center of your face shut about it.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.807
- Listen, I was just trying...
- No, you listen.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.360
You're always going on and on
about how this is such a good neighborhood.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.488
Do you know why it's such
a good neighborhood?

24:01.560 --> 24:06.122
Do you know why your shitty house is worth
20 times what you paid for it in the 1970s?

24:06.200 --> 24:10.205
Because of people like us moving in and
starting illegal businesses in our garages.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.486
All the best companies,

24:11.560 --> 24:14.450
Apple, Google,
Hewlett-Packard, even Aviato,

24:14.520 --> 24:17.683
all of them were started
in un-zoned garages.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.043
That is why Silicon Valley
is one of the hottest neighborhoods

24:21.120 --> 24:22.485
in the world.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.609
Because of people like us,
not because of people like you.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.927
So if I catch even so
much as a dirty glance

24:30.000 --> 24:32.480
or a lascivious look in
Richard's direction,

24:32.560 --> 24:33.641
that is it.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.802
Those weasels are dog food.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.251
Okay. Okay.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.526
Um, uh...

24:38.600 --> 24:40.250
- Guest house.
- Yes.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.004
Is your guest house currently rented out?

24:42.080 --> 24:43.286
No, it's not for rent.

24:43.360 --> 24:45.601
Well, it mother-fucking is now.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.245
Your new tenant is Jared Dunn.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.324
His rent will be exceedingly reasonable.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.006
And his utilities Will be included.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.245
He speaks German in the night.

24:55.760 --> 24:59.003
Well, if you'll excuse us,
we have an illegal business to run.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.081
Erlich?

25:07.200 --> 25:08.531
But when our scientists did the study,

25:08.600 --> 25:10.329
they found the rate of birth defects
in that territory

25:10.400 --> 25:13.768
was actually higher before
we opened our battery plant there.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.361
But, very good question.
Thank you for that question.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.641
Okay.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.446
Before I finish up here,
I have an announcement.

25:20.600 --> 25:24.525
Today, I have accepted the resignation
of Dr. Davis Bannerchek.

25:24.600 --> 25:27.365
So it pleases me to inform you all
that effective immediately,

25:27.440 --> 25:30.171
Nelson Bighetti has been promoted
to sole head dreamer

25:30.240 --> 25:31.605
Of Hooli XYZ.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.201
Sorry, what?

25:34.280 --> 25:35.645
Stand up, Bag Head.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.805
What a meteoric ascension.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.690
Just a few months ago,
you co-founded Pied Piper

25:40.760 --> 25:42.171
and now you've been promoted twice.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.850
It speaks to your competence.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.008
Give it up for Bag Head,
ladies and gentlemen.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.650
And lastly, I have big news.

25:53.720 --> 25:57.691
In anticipation of our big release
of Nucleus at CES in January,

25:57.760 --> 26:00.650
we've decided to give the world
a sneak preview.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.410
Nucleus, in partnership with

26:02.480 --> 26:04.881
Dana White and the
Ultimate Fighting Championship,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.446
will be the exclusive provider
of live streaming

26:07.520 --> 26:09.966
for next month's
Ultimate Fighting Championship event,

26:10.040 --> 26:12.168
Molina versus Bulgakov ll.

26:12.920 --> 26:16.083
I realize the full platform won't be ready
until January,

26:16.160 --> 26:19.130
but our Nucleus division assures me
they are ready for this challenge.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.487
And I can think of no more exciting a way

26:21.600 --> 26:24.444
to give a little taste of Nucleus
to the entire world,

26:24.560 --> 26:28.007
than by putting video latency
in a rear-naked choke hold.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.091
Great job, team. All right, back to work.

26:34.640 --> 26:38.804
Did you, uh, tell Gavin
where we are on the video situation?

26:38.920 --> 26:41.526
He does know that
converting the whole platform to middle-out

26:41.600 --> 26:43.762
has put us at least six weeks
behind schedule, right?

26:44.120 --> 26:47.567
Well, I'm not going to be the one
who tells him we're that far behind.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.369
If you want to, feel free.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.520
I just heard you tell Heidi
we're six weeks behind.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.648
But remember that drop-frame issue
I showed you?

26:57.760 --> 26:59.808
We're easily 15 weeks behind.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.244
Well, I'm not going to be the one
to tell Heidi about that.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.128
Feel free to tell her yourself.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.286
Did I just hear you say
we're only 15 weeks behind?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.604
I've been integrating
the system natively...

27:13.680 --> 27:15.808
Dude, I don't even want to know about it.
