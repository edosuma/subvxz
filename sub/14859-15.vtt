DO YOU GUYS REALIZE THAT
THEIR BRANGELINA NAME

00:08.634 --> 00:10.250

INTERESTING FACT

AND...

00:20.771 --> 00:22.057

ARE YOU REALLY CLEANING
UNDERNEATH THE COUCH,

00:59.726 --> 01:01.967

YEAH, I'M LOVING IT!

01:12.656 --> 01:14.488
GUYS, AM I JUST
SO EXCITED TO NOT BE

THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY GOOD

01:20.622 --> 01:22.158
FOR ME AND STEVE.
(chuckles) AND... TIME!

01:22.457 --> 01:23.572
THREE MINUTES
AND SEVEN SECONDS

01:23.875 --> 01:25.331
TILL SHE MENTIONED
THE GUY SHE'S DATING.

01:25.627 --> 01:26.583
WHO HAD THREE MINUTES?

01:26.878 --> 01:28.039
| HAD 11 SECONDS, SO...
OH, NO.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.954
| THOUGHT SHE WAS OPENING
WITH IT, SO I'M OUT.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.543
| HAD TWO HOURS.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.708

A COOL THING TO BET ON.

THREE MINUTES.
PAY UP, SUCKDOGS.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.710
MAKE IT RAIN.
YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT ME

01:37.014 --> 01:38.129
WHEN I'M NOT AROUND?
(chuckles)

01:38.432 --> 01:39.388
ALL THE TIME.

01:39.683 --> 01:42.766
I Id

01:49.568 --> 01:52.105
SO I'M FINALLY GETTING IN ON
THE INNER CIRCLE WITH MY BOSS.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.565
I'VE KIND OF BECOME
THE ASIDE GUY.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.275
ASIDE GUY?

01:55.574 --> 01:57.781
THIS FUND GIVES US ACCESS
TO EUROPEAN CAPITAL MARKETS.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.568
(lowered voice) THIS PROJECT
WILL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.737
BETTER CASH IN YOUR STOCK.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.951
(chuckles) IF 1 HAD TO FIRE
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM,

02:05.250 --> 02:07.332
WHO WOULD GO ON
AN OFFICE-WIDE KILLING SPREE?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.118
IT IS PERMITTED
TO OFFER SECURITIES

02:09.420 --> 02:11.879
USING A SIMPLIFIED PROSPECTUS
THAT INCORPORATES...

02:12.174 --> 02:13.130
(both) BERGER.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.757
HE REALLY WOULD KILL
ALL OF US. (laughs)

02:16.053 --> 02:18.545
OKAY, HERE'S ME AND STEVE
ON A ROMANTIC PICNIC...

02:18.847 --> 02:20.337
AW.
AT THE BEACH.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.884
HERE'S ONE OF HIM SLEEPING,
SLEEPING, SLEEPING, SLEEPING.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.426
SO IT'S MOSTLY SLEEPING?
WHAT? NO.

02:25.729 --> 02:29.688
HERE HE IS RESTING,
DOZING, SNOOZING.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.146
OH... GOD. I'M SORRY.
HERE I AM, LIKE, FLAUNTING

02:33.445 --> 02:35.356
THE MOST INTIMATE MOMENTS
OF MY RELATIONSHIP,

02:35.656 --> 02:37.146
WHEN SOME OF US...

02:37.449 --> 02:38.610
DON'T HAVE DATES
FOR THE WEDDING.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.149
THAT IS ROOF STOOF.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.238
PENNELS, YOU ARE NOT GONNA
STIR THE POOP UP, OKAY?

02:42.537 --> 02:43.698
THERE IS
NO DRAMA AT THIS WEDDING,

02:43.997 --> 02:45.362
AND YOU KNOW MY MOTTO--
“SAVE THE DRAMA

02:45.666 --> 02:47.407
FOR WILMER VALDERRAMA.”
(Alex) OH, NO, NO, NO.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.666
IT'S PRONOUNCED WILVER
VALMARONDO. NO, IT'S NOT.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.497
SO, WHAT, NOW MY MOTTO
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE--

02:51.797 --> 02:53.504
“I WANT TO BUY A CONDO
WITH WILVER VALMARONDO”?

02:53.799 --> 02:55.915
IT NEVER DID. SO, PENNY, SINCE
YOU'RE GONNA BE UP THERE

02:56.218 --> 02:59.882
BEING A GROOMSLADY, OLD STEVE
CAN SIT WITH THE REST OF US.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.091
(Alex and Penny) MM. CAN'T
WAIT TO GET TO KNOW HIM.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.849
WAIT. NO ONE TOLD JANE ABOUT
THE WEDDING PARTY SITUATION?

03:05.143 --> 03:06.099
(squeaks)
WHAT ABOUT IT?

03:06.395 --> 03:07.851
(laughs)
EVERYBODY'S IN IT BUT YOU.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.432
(high-pitched voice)
IS THAT WATER?

03:09.731 --> 03:11.438
AND THAT'S ONLY
BECAUSE WE ORGANIZED THE PARTY

03:11.733 --> 03:13.394
ACCORDING TO HEIGHT,
AND I ALREADY HAD A5'8".

03:13.694 --> 03:14.650
(chuckles) I'M SO SORRY.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.185
THAT'S FINE.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.899
QUIET JANE IS
THE SCARIEST JANE.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.905
THE WORLD'S
MOST DANGEROUS JANE.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.656
UH...
(gasps)

'CAUSE I'M NOT DOING IT,

WITH MANDONNA AT HIS WEDDING.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.289
(Alex and Dave) MANDONNA?!

NO MATTER HOW CREEPY AND THIN
HIS MUSTACHE GETS.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.441
YEAH.
HE LOOKS LIKE

03:56.737 --> 03:58.478
A HULKED-OUT, 'ROIDED-UP
JOHN WATERS.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.942
DUE TO RISING ENERGY COSTS,
WE THINK THIS PROGRAM

04:01.241 --> 04:02.572
WILL HELP US HEDGE
OUR EXPOSURE.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.404
(lowered voice)
THIS PLAN WILL NEVER WORK.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.319
(chuckles) TOTALLY.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.235
I'M CUTTING
THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT.

04:18.632 --> 04:19.589
YES.

04:19.885 --> 04:20.966

04:26.641 --> 04:28.848
NOW YOU'D BETTER GET OUT
OF HERE FAST.

04:29.144 --> 04:32.011
I'M ABOUT TO GIVE BERGER

06:12.122 --> 06:13.612
HE SAID,
'“IT'S TOO BIG ASTEP,”

06:13.915 --> 06:15.781
AND THEN I SAID, “YOUR SISTER'S
GOT SLOPPY YABOS.”

06:16.084 --> 06:17.574
(gasps) WHY DO I ALWAYS
GO TO SLOP-YABS?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.039

15:59.584 --> 16:00.870
BY MIXING IT WITH ANTACIDS

16:01.169 --> 16:03.035
AND THE BOTTLE OF WHISKEY YOU'RE
