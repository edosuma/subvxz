00:01.520 --> 00:02.830
The day of the accident,

00:02.830 --> 00:05.440
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.340
You're back!

00:07.400 --> 00:08.580
Do I know you?

00:08.580 --> 00:10.536
Your memories, they're not yours.

00:10.536 --> 00:12.225
- Who am I?  - Jim!

00:12.225 --> 00:13.784
I'm not your husband.

00:13.784 --> 00:15.214
What's wrong with Melinda? What's going on?

00:15.215 --> 00:16.649
She's trapped underground. The water is rising.

00:16.649 --> 00:18.630
You know all this from a ghost?

00:18.630 --> 00:20.420
Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith.

00:30.051 --> 00:32.307
Sam! You came for me!

00:32.307 --> 00:34.652
Why do you keep calling me Sam?

00:34.695 --> 00:36.508
Call me Jim, Mel, it's my name.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.534
Jim!

00:39.933 --> 00:41.642
This is my face now?

00:45.005 --> 00:46.101
You did it for us.

00:49.528 --> 00:50.621
Can you tell me more?

00:51.184 --> 00:52.486
I've been giving you every detail.

00:52.487 --> 00:55.276
You really don't remember being Sam at all?

00:55.888 --> 00:57.113
I don't.

00:57.113 --> 00:59.592
I mean, I remembered the sound of a gun shot

00:59.592 --> 01:02.071
and then the burning feeling in my shoulder.

01:02.957 --> 01:05.968
And then seeing you. And your hand in mine.

01:05.968 --> 01:08.686
- And then...  - You never left me.

01:09.535 --> 01:10.785
Never.

01:13.140 --> 01:17.912
I died. And I don't remember any of that either. I mean, the after part

01:18.012 --> 01:21.238
- The ghost part?  - Yeah. And I always wanted to know

01:21.238 --> 01:24.702
like, how the... how their after lives.

01:25.506 --> 01:26.732
What about you?

01:26.732 --> 01:28.922
You know, how long you've been seeing the same guy?

01:28.922 --> 01:31.270
- Two months?  - All right, I knew it was you.

01:31.270 --> 01:33.247
Ok, I saw you go into his body.

01:33.247 --> 01:34.824
All I see is you.

01:35.344 --> 01:36.824
Nobody else does, huh.

01:38.487 --> 01:39.824
You know, people are gonna talk.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.100
A merry widow and all that.

01:41.260 --> 01:42.600
Hmm. Let them.

01:42.660 --> 01:45.500
Yeah,but seriously...

01:46.760 --> 01:49.030
What are we going to do?

01:49.100 --> 01:50.900
You know?

01:52.460 --> 01:53.760
Who am I gonna be?

01:54.130 --> 01:55.460
The man I married.

01:55.530 --> 01:57.130
Yeah,but not to everybody else.

02:01.060 --> 02:04.360
It's almost 5 A.M.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.360
Do you have to work today?

02:07.430 --> 02:10.199
No. No,I'll have Delia cover for me

02:10.259 --> 02:11.860
Or I'll close the shop.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.760
Want to get some sleep?

02:13.830 --> 02:16.000
I can't,honestly.

02:16.190 --> 02:17.730
Coffee.

02:17.790 --> 02:19.530
I'll go make it.

02:50.230 --> 02:52.290
Help me!

02:52.360 --> 02:54.660
Help! Help! Help me!

02:54.730 --> 02:59.190
What's happening?  Help! Help me!

03:39.730 --> 03:42.090
Help me,help me!

03:42.160 --> 03:44.060
Please help me, please help me!

03:44.060 --> 03:46.490
Morgan,it's me. Eli,your neighbor. Are you all right?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.590
- I don't know!  - Is someone in there with...

03:48.660 --> 03:50.660
No. No.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.020
I think I'm going crazy.

03:53.090 --> 03:55.890
Please help me.

04:05.397 --> 04:07.119
Why are the curtains doing that?

04:07.260 --> 04:10.290
That windows is... It's closed.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.990
I see.

04:17.060 --> 04:18.920
I don't understand what's happening to me.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.790
No,it's ok. It's all right.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.920
I'm going to help you,ok?

04:22.990 --> 04:25.020
Do you want to die?

05:05.160 --> 05:07.460
Honey,that is your third expresso this morning.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.690
You're exhausted. Just go home.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.560
I would love to, believe me,

05:11.620 --> 05:13.590
But I just feel like Jim needs his space.

05:13.660 --> 05:15.490
You just got back together!

05:15.560 --> 05:16.860
Yeah,we did.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.460
And it's amazing, you know,

05:18.520 --> 05:20.720
And I'm really grateful and he is,too.

05:20.790 --> 05:22.220
It's just...

05:22.290 --> 05:23.520
I got him back, you know,

05:23.590 --> 05:24.790
But he didn't get his life back.

05:24.860 --> 05:27.941
He's gotta go find himself all over again.

05:27.941 --> 05:29.690
He's got Sam's face, Sam's resume?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.160
And Jim's skills.

05:31.220 --> 05:34.190
Well,can't he just study to be a paramedic again?

05:34.260 --> 05:36.260
I mean,he'd ace the course work.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.560
Yeah,what about his friends?

05:37.620 --> 05:38.720
I mean,isn't that kind of lying?

05:45.090 --> 05:46.520
Are you ok?

05:46.590 --> 05:48.560
Good,fine.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.960
Sort of,not so good.

05:51.020 --> 05:52.690
I ran into a nasty ghost this morning.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.690
- Oh. Anyone you know?  - No.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.620
And if he's a neighbor, I'm glad I never met him,

05:56.690 --> 05:58.720
Because he's terrorizing the girl next door.

05:58.790 --> 06:01.060
- What's the connection?  - I don't know.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.690
She says she's never known anyone who's died,

06:02.760 --> 06:04.590
Except her grandmother and a boy she knew in the eighth grade

06:04.660 --> 06:06.120
Who choked on a brussel sprout.

06:06.190 --> 06:08.020
That's horrible.

06:08.090 --> 06:09.960
Chew your food. That's what my mom always tells me.

06:10.020 --> 06:12.460
Look,I know you're all blissed out and reunited

06:12.520 --> 06:13.590
And you want to be with Jim

06:13.660 --> 06:15.860
and you guys just probably want to be together.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.090
Wait,why aren't you together?

06:17.160 --> 06:19.020
Eli,how can I help you?

06:19.090 --> 06:20.420
The ghost is making some intense threats,

06:20.490 --> 06:22.860
And I don't know if they're for me or for her.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.290
What kind of threats?

06:24.360 --> 06:26.520
Very specific. He asked me if I wanted to die.

06:26.590 --> 06:29.160
- Which I don't.  - That's all he said?

06:29.220 --> 06:30.690
I guess he felt he made his point.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.060
So tell me about her dreams.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.920
Let's just say that this guy is not a big fan of gravity.

06:35.990 --> 06:38.290
Are you ok here?

06:38.360 --> 06:39.360
Yeah,absolutely, no problem.

06:39.420 --> 06:41.960
Let's go.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.320
How long have these things been happening?

06:48.690 --> 06:50.020
I don't know.

06:50.090 --> 06:52.490
It feels like a dream.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.890
That's what I thought was happening,

06:53.960 --> 06:56.490
That I was sleepwalking and just trashing my place.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.720
Until you saw it,too.

06:58.790 --> 07:00.000
The wind.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.900
Hale and hearty. From a closed window.

07:02.970 --> 07:06.770
So you can communicate with the dead?

07:06.840 --> 07:08.940
I mean,what do you see, auras or something?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.870
Or something.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.500
Um,so you don't know anyone who died?

07:15.570 --> 07:18.970
A man? Not too old, not too young.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.300
No.

07:20.370 --> 07:23.000
And you're not sure of when this all started?

07:23.070 --> 07:25.740
Like I said, it feels like a dream.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.300
A nightmare.

07:27.370 --> 07:29.900
The same one over and over.

07:29.970 --> 07:31.340
More or less.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.770
Why is this happening?

07:32.840 --> 07:35.540
Someone who died has some unfinished business with you.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.740
I told you,I don't know anyone who's died.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.770
Are you sure that it's a man?

07:42.840 --> 07:44.300
Pretty sure.

08:02.170 --> 08:03.070
Melinda!

08:03.500 --> 08:05.700
Oh! Oh,my god!

08:06.470 --> 08:07.570
What happened?

08:07.640 --> 08:09.300
My god,are you ok?

08:09.370 --> 08:13.040
Can I...can I get some water? Please?

08:13.100 --> 08:15.040
Yeah,uh...

08:15.100 --> 08:18.140
My heart...my heart was pounding in my chest

08:18.200 --> 08:19.740
And I felt like I was falling.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.170
- You almost did.  - No,no,no.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.340
- Really falling.  - You were really falling.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.740
No,to my death!

08:25.700 --> 08:28.500
I think that's how the ghost died.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.340
So you've been having nightmares every night.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.720
You wake up,your stuff is levitating

08:37.721 --> 08:39.090
and you have no idea when it started?

08:39.549 --> 08:41.220
Well,Morgan's probably embarrassed.

08:41.289 --> 08:44.090
It's not easy to admit a ghost has been floating your knick knacks.

08:44.150 --> 08:45.350
Is it me or does knick knack sound dirty?

08:45.420 --> 08:47.590
It's you,and unless she's haunted by an astronaut,

08:47.650 --> 08:50.390
I think we should be looking into falling,not floating.

08:50.450 --> 08:51.820
Ok,ahead of you there,

08:51.821 --> 08:53.190
but that's not exactly narrowing the field.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.535
We could spend all day looking to id accident victims

08:55.535 --> 08:56.840
Or suicides who fell to their deaths.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.570
The curtains. It wasn't just the wind,

08:59.640 --> 09:00.900
It was the curtains.

09:00.970 --> 09:02.540
You said in her dream that she was floating

09:02.600 --> 09:04.500
before he brought her back slowly to the floor.

09:04.570 --> 09:06.870
Ok,so he was careful with her, or torturing her.

09:06.940 --> 09:09.770
I'm sorry,did you say you liked Morgan's curtains?

09:09.840 --> 09:13.270
In my vision, the floating, my heart pounding,

09:13.340 --> 09:14.770
The billowing fabric.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.270
Maybe there's only one kind of jumper we need to be looking for.

09:17.340 --> 09:20.470
Oh,a recreational one! A parachute.

09:20.540 --> 09:21.600
Here.

09:21.670 --> 09:23.600
Skydiving.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.800
Here we go...one incident, and a Grandview resident.

09:27.870 --> 09:28.840
Oh,you're so much faster than me.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.070
- How do you...  - That's him,

09:30.140 --> 09:32.440
Rick Hartman. He died skydiving in Mexico.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.800
Oof. His chute never opened. That had to hurt.

09:34.870 --> 09:38.240
It says he was on a tour with extreme action adventure company.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.700
His death was their first fatality.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.370
The irony,it's too cruel.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.570
It says that he was an actuary.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.900
The guy spends his life behind the safety of a desk assessing risk,

09:46.970 --> 09:49.300
and he dies trying one of the riskiest sports around?

09:49.310 --> 09:51.380
An actuary. What does your neighbor do?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.380
Some kind of graphic arts.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.860
Wait,he's 15 years older than her. An actuary.

09:54.930 --> 09:57.060
She's an artist. How do they know each other?

09:57.130 --> 09:59.430
Was that his old apartment,did they meet on the internet?

09:59.490 --> 10:01.460
Well,let's give her his name and see if it rings a bell.

10:01.530 --> 10:02.990
Great,but I doubt you'll get very far.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.030
- Why?  -He died 6 weeks ago.

10:05.090 --> 10:06.730
If she knew him, wouldn't she have heard?

10:06.790 --> 10:07.960
You might want to talk to someone else.

10:08.030 --> 10:09.130
Well, who?  He lived alone.

10:09.190 --> 10:10.260
He didn't have any kids.

10:10.330 --> 10:11.542
The action adventure people.

10:11.542 --> 10:12.785
He died on their watch.

10:15.188 --> 10:16.181
There you go.

10:16.503 --> 10:17.760
So are you ok? You need anything else?

10:17.830 --> 10:19.260
No,I'm good. Thanks for the coffee.

10:19.260 --> 10:20.190
Thanks for meeting me.

10:20.190 --> 10:21.790
It's all about the client. We aim to please.

10:21.860 --> 10:23.390
Yeah,and scare the crap out of people.

10:23.460 --> 10:25.090
I was looking at your company's website...

10:25.160 --> 10:27.190
Glacier skiing, running class four rapids,

10:27.260 --> 10:28.260
Bullfighting?

10:28.330 --> 10:30.030
Yeah,but on the cycling tour in italy,

10:30.090 --> 10:32.590
There's a van that follows you with bread, cheese and a daybed.

10:32.660 --> 10:33.860
Here's a catalog.

10:33.930 --> 10:36.130
Oh! I want to go skydiving.

10:36.190 --> 10:37.430
I dreamt about it my whole life,

10:37.490 --> 10:39.530
But I'm a little nervous.

10:39.590 --> 10:42.630
I read about that guy, the one who died.

10:42.690 --> 10:44.760
Yeah,that was...

10:44.830 --> 10:48.330
A terrible accident. It was,um,

10:48.390 --> 10:50.260
It seems his chute was packed improperly.

10:50.330 --> 10:51.790
Oh,I don't know how to pack a chute.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.660
Yeah,but the fellow you're referring to, I mean...

10:54.730 --> 10:56.960
Uh,what's his name, Rick something?

10:57.030 --> 10:58.290
Rick Hartman.

10:58.360 --> 11:02.160
He did know. He jumped several times.

11:02.230 --> 11:04.930
But just you know, the first 10 jumps are always accompanied,

11:04.990 --> 11:06.830
So if for whatever reason your chute doesn't open,

11:06.890 --> 11:08.590
Your instructor's will.

11:08.660 --> 11:11.060
Wait,that guy did more than 10 jumps?

11:11.130 --> 11:14.460
Yeah. I mean, he climbed volcanoes, he swam with the sharks,

11:14.530 --> 11:16.030
He hunted wild bore.

11:16.090 --> 11:17.460
Most dangerous one, by the way.

11:17.530 --> 11:20.790
Did he ever mention a girl to you, named Morgan?

11:20.860 --> 11:22.930
Uh,no.

11:22.990 --> 11:26.290
Wait a minute, did you know this guy?

11:26.360 --> 11:27.890
No.

11:30.030 --> 11:33.190
You're not interested in booking a trip with us,are you?

11:33.260 --> 11:36.290
Look,jack, all I can tell you is I'm not a cop,

11:36.360 --> 11:38.330
And I don't work for any insurance companies.

11:38.390 --> 11:39.910
I'm just trying to help someone who knew Rick

11:39.911 --> 11:41.430
get her life back.

11:41.490 --> 11:43.090
Well,maybe you should be talking to her about him.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.230
I did.

11:44.290 --> 11:46.090
Problem is, she claimed she never knew him.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.760
Look,he died jumping out of your airplane.

11:48.830 --> 11:50.830
I figured you'd want to help.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.660
Did he seem like someone who got fixated on things?

11:55.730 --> 11:58.660
Now,look,a guy comes in, he's a total pencil pusher.

11:58.730 --> 12:00.990
He said he'd never even played contact sports in his life,

12:01.060 --> 12:04.090
And a week later, he's spelunking in a cave in Brazil.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.490
You must have been some salesman.

12:05.490 --> 12:07.072
No, I didn't push. Not at all.

12:07.072 --> 12:08.041
It all came from him.

12:08.076 --> 12:09.760
It's like he got addicted to the thrills

12:09.830 --> 12:11.260
Or he had a...

12:12.790 --> 12:14.230
A death wish?

12:16.668 --> 12:17.830
So now you're a trust attorney?

12:17.890 --> 12:18.610
Hey,you know what

12:18.610 --> 12:20.782
my legal expertise was only implied.

12:20.817 --> 12:21.860
The landlord made assumptions.

12:21.930 --> 12:23.630
Wow, this place looks untouched.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.130
So why is all this stuff still in here?

12:25.190 --> 12:26.990
Oh, you know, no family to clean it out.

12:27.060 --> 12:28.730
Condo's in the trust, but the estate

12:28.790 --> 12:30.990
Hasn't put it on the market yet.

12:31.060 --> 12:33.130
Well, it is definitely ready to show.

12:33.290 --> 12:35.230
I mean, everything looks very organized.

12:35.490 --> 12:37.390
All put in neat little stacks.

12:37.460 --> 12:38.960
What are we looking for?

12:39.030 --> 12:41.360
Just to find out why Mr. Safe and reasonable

12:41.430 --> 12:43.260
Was hooked on a death wish.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.760
Man, even his books were alphabetized.

12:45.930 --> 12:49.660
Yeah, and this stuff, "for my good friend Neil."

12:49.730 --> 12:52.260
Everything on this desk has one of these labels.

12:54.290 --> 12:58.790
"For Jocelyn Gracie, my colleague and my friend."

12:58.860 --> 13:00.960
This guy wasn't just organized.

13:01.702 --> 13:03.951
No, he definitely had his affairs in order

13:03.951 --> 13:05.738
And was expecting the end.

13:08.645 --> 13:09.701
Wait, look at this.

13:10.113 --> 13:12.006
Anti-nausea pain pills.

13:12.198 --> 13:13.173
All this medication

13:13.173 --> 13:15.293
That's what you take for chemo and end-stage cancer.

13:15.534 --> 13:17.199
Ok. So he was dying.

13:18.820 --> 13:20.440
All right. Keep looking around.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.352
See if you can find anything with Morgan's name on it.

13:22.352 --> 13:24.109
Help us know why he's haunting her.

13:29.528 --> 13:30.780
Wait a minute, what is this?

13:32.328 --> 13:34.648
"Scuba diving on The Great Barrier Reef."

13:34.909 --> 13:37.185
"Boar hunting in Fiji, skydiving,"

13:37.185 --> 13:38.218
Check, check, check.

13:38.830 --> 13:39.892
This is a bucket list...

13:40.386 --> 13:42.016
Things he was determined to do before he died.

13:42.086 --> 13:44.816
Yeah. "cook a perfect Denver omelet,"

13:44.886 --> 13:46.186
And "live to see the lunar eclipse."

13:46.256 --> 13:47.308
Hmm, close but no cigar.

13:47.308 --> 13:48.330
That's happening this week.

13:48.330 --> 13:50.216
Look at the last thing on the list.

13:51.256 --> 13:52.922
- Morgan. - Yep.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.244
Had no checkmark.

13:54.244 --> 13:55.268
What did he want with her?

13:55.640 --> 13:57.128
Whatever it is, he didn't get it.

13:57.686 --> 13:59.186
Not yet, anyway.

14:03.656 --> 14:05.516
- I can keep looking. -Okay, Great.

14:05.986 --> 14:07.316
Yeah, I just thought it would be worth a look.

14:07.686 --> 14:09.836
Don't be freaked out, it's going to be fine.

14:09.836 --> 14:11.256
- Promise. - ok. all right.

14:11.256 --> 14:12.281
- Bye. - bye.

14:12.316 --> 14:13.916
So?

14:13.986 --> 14:16.156
She pulled up his obit, looked at the photo,

14:16.216 --> 14:17.316
Nothing.

14:17.386 --> 14:19.216
And what'd she say about the bucket list?

14:19.286 --> 14:21.286
"Gross."

14:21.356 --> 14:23.086
Seriously, that's what she said.

14:23.156 --> 14:24.616
I mean, do you blame her?

14:24.686 --> 14:27.569
It's one thing to be the object of some stranger's obsession,

14:27.569 --> 14:28.686
But a dead stranger?

14:28.756 --> 14:29.986
So he's obsessed with someone

14:30.056 --> 14:31.556
He's never even met before?

14:31.616 --> 14:33.086
- It happens. - Not very often.

14:33.156 --> 14:34.556
You think she's lying to us?

14:35.037 --> 14:36.016
She was his dying wish.

14:36.086 --> 14:38.086
You're gonna tell me he never introduced himself

14:38.156 --> 14:39.556
Or asked her out?

14:39.616 --> 14:41.117
Maybe he did and she passed.

14:41.117 --> 14:42.664
I mean,do you remember every guy

14:42.664 --> 14:43.517
That's ever asked you out?

14:43.517 --> 14:46.386
He wasn't afraid to step off the side of a moving plane.

14:46.456 --> 14:48.486
You think he's going to be afraid of a little rejection?

14:48.556 --> 14:50.216
She has to remember him.

14:50.286 --> 14:51.786
Then why would she lie about it?

14:51.856 --> 14:54.456
I don't know. Want me to talk to her?

14:54.516 --> 14:56.716
No, let me get closer.

14:56.786 --> 14:58.216
Closer?

14:58.286 --> 15:01.386
Why are you willing to believe everything this girl says?

15:01.456 --> 15:03.616
She's my neighbor. She's nice.

15:05.086 --> 15:06.743
I've spoken to her maybe 3 times before this.

15:06.743 --> 15:08.516
She's spoken back to me maybe once.

15:08.586 --> 15:10.171
Yeah, cross the ghost over

15:10.171 --> 15:11.729
And then you'll get her attention.

15:33.516 --> 15:36.286
She's not in.

15:36.356 --> 15:39.556
I saw her go out with one of those green shopping bags.

15:39.616 --> 15:43.016
I'm all for saving the planet, but burlap?

15:43.086 --> 15:44.186
Not exactly sassy.

15:44.256 --> 15:46.286
Mrs. Blakelock, when you see Morgan,

15:46.356 --> 15:47.786
Will you tell her that I'm looking for her?

15:47.856 --> 15:51.086
Oh, I don't get in people's business.

15:51.156 --> 15:52.886
I mind my own.

15:52.956 --> 15:54.186
Right, of course.

15:54.256 --> 15:56.656
- Is that a new jacket? - Yes, thank you.

15:56.716 --> 15:59.886
Now why don't men wear real jackets anymore?

15:59.956 --> 16:03.056
You know, suit jackets attract the right kind of girl.

16:03.116 --> 16:05.416
Ok. All right. Yeah.

16:08.838 --> 16:10.338
Actually, Mrs. Blakelock,

16:10.338 --> 16:12.389
I have a question for...you.

16:13.856 --> 16:16.616
Have you ever seen this man with Morgan?

16:16.686 --> 16:18.616
Oh, sure.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.016
They like to hang out on the roof.

16:21.086 --> 16:22.986
Yeah, no one's supposed to be up there.

16:23.056 --> 16:24.286
It's under construction.

16:24.356 --> 16:25.316
Were they dating?

16:25.386 --> 16:27.786
He's a little old for her, don't you think?

16:27.856 --> 16:30.456
Well, I suppose. Were they friends?

16:30.516 --> 16:32.136
All I know is,

16:32.431 --> 16:35.280
They left here every Tuesday, 2:15,

16:35.280 --> 16:36.729
Like clockwork.

16:36.764 --> 16:37.716
Do you know where they went?

16:39.134 --> 16:40.615
Well, one time,

16:40.650 --> 16:43.816
I just happened to be struggling with my mail.

16:43.886 --> 16:45.557
They stuff the box so full!

16:46.001 --> 16:48.316
And I heard the word "meeting."

16:49.280 --> 16:52.157
Another time, I heard the word "group."

16:53.091 --> 16:54.156
You know,my ex-husband

16:54.216 --> 16:56.319
Did group therapy in the seventies.

16:56.354 --> 16:59.256
He met a high-strung stewardess and they fell in love.

16:59.316 --> 17:01.956
Group therapy can produce positive results.

17:02.016 --> 17:03.184
Not for me.

17:04.601 --> 17:09.512
It could have been drugs or a cohol. Those group meetings.

17:09.656 --> 17:12.455
That man, Morgan's friend, he had the look.

17:12.516 --> 17:13.556
What do you mean?

17:13.616 --> 17:17.955
Kind of thin, Pale, waxy.

17:18.016 --> 17:20.286
Yeah. That I knew.

17:20.356 --> 17:21.816
Ok.

17:27.056 --> 17:28.415
Thank you.

17:29.486 --> 17:30.356
Delia.

17:31.516 --> 17:33.786
Uh, Jim. Hi.

17:33.856 --> 17:35.586
What's happening?

17:35.656 --> 17:36.807
Well, I was just going to go get some coffee

17:36.807 --> 17:37.960
And then stop by the store

17:38.156 --> 17:39.656
And see if Melinda wanted to have lunch.

17:39.716 --> 17:40.307
She's not there.

17:40.307 --> 17:42.814
She went to do something with Eli. You know

17:42.814 --> 17:44.317
- Ghostly. - Yeah.

17:44.416 --> 17:45.916
But she said they'd be back soon.

17:45.986 --> 17:47.086
- Ok,thanks. - Yeah.

17:49.012 --> 17:50.405
Oh, hey, Bobby. What's up?

17:51.006 --> 17:52.125
Bobby Tooch.

17:54.816 --> 17:56.786
You're...

17:56.856 --> 17:57.856
Bobby, this is,um...

17:57.916 --> 17:59.316
- Sam. - Sam Lucas.

17:59.386 --> 18:01.486
Melinda's friend, and mine.

18:01.556 --> 18:04.356
Right, right. I've seen you around...

18:04.416 --> 18:06.316
With Melinda.

18:09.316 --> 18:11.216
So much for coffee.

18:11.286 --> 18:13.556
Oh,well, do you want to take mine?

18:13.616 --> 18:14.616
Thank you.

18:14.686 --> 18:16.354
I will see you, Delia.

18:16.354 --> 18:17.553
Tell Melinda hello.

18:17.553 --> 18:19.981
She needs anything, anything at all.

18:20.397 --> 18:21.625
- We're here for her. - Got it.

18:26.260 --> 18:28.444
Do you know how many shifts I worked with that guy?

18:29.016 --> 18:31.356
I mean, how many people we helped?

18:31.416 --> 18:32.916
The number of double dates Melinda and I went out

18:32.986 --> 18:35.256
With him and his girlfriends.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.586
I'm really sorry, Jim.

18:38.656 --> 18:41.286
I'd say I know how weird this must be,

18:41.356 --> 18:44.316
But I really just can't imagine.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.386
Ah, don't be sorry.

18:55.223 --> 18:56.552
It's good to be back.

18:58.151 --> 18:58.961
See you.

18:59.661 --> 19:01.046
Tell Melinda I'll see her at home.

19:09.038 --> 19:10.556
Hi, I'm Dave Mckey, one of the counselors here.

19:10.616 --> 19:12.256
- Can I help you? - Hey, Eli James.

19:12.316 --> 19:14.086
I'm a therapist over at Rockland u.

19:14.156 --> 19:15.756
I have a question about one of your patients.

19:15.816 --> 19:17.665
Ok, I'll help you if I can.

19:18.535 --> 19:19.856
I'm here about Rick Hartman.

19:19.916 --> 19:22.856
Actually, a friend of his. Morgan Jefferies.

19:24.054 --> 19:24.998
How's she doing?

19:25.144 --> 19:26.336
Honestly, not so good.

19:26.516 --> 19:28.516
She's really struggling with his death.

19:29.516 --> 19:32.516
Yeah, well, they were so close.

19:32.586 --> 19:34.886
Yeah. yeah, they were.

19:34.956 --> 19:37.156
Very.

19:37.216 --> 19:39.684
And I was wondering, since,um,

19:39.684 --> 19:42.232
She accompanied him to so many meetings

19:42.232 --> 19:44.056
If you could give me an insight into their relationship,

19:44.116 --> 19:45.192
To allow me to help her.

19:45.192 --> 19:47.356
I'm sorry, I can't speak to their relationship.

19:47.416 --> 19:49.254
The groups need to be a safe place for people

19:49.254 --> 19:50.484
To share their feelings.

19:50.484 --> 19:52.447
Of course, I understand. It's just...

19:53.425 --> 19:54.786
Therapist to therapist,

19:54.856 --> 19:58.186
The depth of her grieving, it...

19:58.256 --> 20:00.556
She's not the most forthcoming patient.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.788
Well, maybe you should encourage her

20:03.788 --> 20:06.190
To come back to the group.

20:09.286 --> 20:11.256
To this group?

20:14.041 --> 20:16.900
I thought she was really getting solace from it,

20:16.935 --> 20:18.156
True support.

20:18.216 --> 20:21.116
And long before Rick even joined.

20:21.186 --> 20:23.416
I'd hate to see Rick's death get in the way of that.

20:23.486 --> 20:24.756
Wait, she joined first?

20:24.816 --> 20:27.387
Yeah, that's how they met.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.152
These are her peers.

20:29.856 --> 20:31.856
No one else understands what she's going through.

20:31.916 --> 20:33.216
Even we can't.

20:33.286 --> 20:34.756
We're not on the same level.

20:34.816 --> 20:37.386
It could also be the medication.

20:37.456 --> 20:41.356
I mean, it does do that sometimes, exacerbate depression.

20:41.416 --> 20:43.656
Because Morgan's dying, too.

20:43.716 --> 20:46.256
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:46.316 --> 20:47.441
I assumed you knew.

20:51.716 --> 20:54.281
It feels a smidge sneaky tricking a fellow therapist

20:54.281 --> 20:55.896
But how else were we supposed to find out

20:55.896 --> 20:57.111
That Morgan is dying?

20:57.146 --> 20:58.264
What I don't get is if she and Rick

20:58.264 --> 20:59.946
were really as close as that guy says,

20:59.981 --> 21:00.756
Why didn't she mention him?

21:00.816 --> 21:03.083
Why is he tormenting her with those dreams

21:03.083 --> 21:04.200
If they were friends?

21:05.185 --> 21:05.981
Uh, a little heads up,

21:05.990 --> 21:07.590
He doesn't look so friendly right now.

21:07.660 --> 21:08.860
Leave her alone.

21:08.960 --> 21:11.290
We're not the problem. Why are you haunting her?

21:11.360 --> 21:14.160
Is it because she doesn't want people to know she's sick?

21:14.230 --> 21:16.060
No one outside of the group.

21:16.130 --> 21:17.160
The group she stopped going to?

21:17.230 --> 21:19.490
It's like she wants to die.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.560
"Do you want to die?" It wasn't a threat,

21:22.630 --> 21:24.160
It was meant for her.

21:24.230 --> 21:26.560
- Why is she doing this?  - What?

21:26.630 --> 21:29.560
Nothing. Not one thing to save her life.

21:29.630 --> 21:31.360
And haunting her with images of your death

21:31.430 --> 21:33.460
Is supposed to what, inspire her?

21:33.530 --> 21:34.790
She has a chance.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.530
Why won't she take it?

21:41.090 --> 21:42.890
- What's going on?  - Can we come in?

21:42.960 --> 21:44.490
It's important.

21:46.060 --> 21:48.290
Yeah.

21:52.990 --> 21:54.760
I didn't tell you I knew Rick

21:54.830 --> 21:58.460
Because I didn't want you to know how we met.

21:58.530 --> 22:00.860
Morgan,I'm sorry. I had no idea.

22:00.930 --> 22:03.230
You look so healthy.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.960
I'm not in any pain.

22:08.030 --> 22:10.830
I'm feeling even stronger now that I'm off the drugs.

22:10.890 --> 22:14.260
- Were you doing chemo?  - Among other things.

22:14.330 --> 22:16.230
- You name it,I tried it.  - Well,that's strange.

22:16.290 --> 22:20.090
'Cause Rick seemed to think you weren't fighting it.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.730
Really?

22:21.790 --> 22:24.360
Did he... did he tell you that?

22:24.430 --> 22:25.630
Yeah.

22:26.830 --> 22:28.230
Is he here right now?

22:28.290 --> 22:30.430
No. No, but when I see him,

22:30.490 --> 22:33.060
I can see him as clearly as I can see you.

22:34.690 --> 22:36.360
So...

22:36.430 --> 22:37.760
Was that something you talked about,

22:37.830 --> 22:39.960
Him wanting you to fight?

22:40.030 --> 22:42.790
Guess that's why I was on his bucket list.

22:42.860 --> 22:45.730
When Rick found out he was dying,

22:45.790 --> 22:47.760
It just made him come alive.

22:47.830 --> 22:52.030
He was willing to take on anything.

22:52.090 --> 22:55.830
But he's right, I am done fighting.

22:55.890 --> 22:58.560
I get the sense he's not going to give up on you,

22:58.630 --> 23:00.360
Even if you're going to give up on yourself.

23:00.430 --> 23:02.030
Why would you? I mean,

23:02.090 --> 23:06.030
You've tried all these other cures, so why give up now?

23:06.090 --> 23:09.260
Out of options.

23:09.330 --> 23:12.330
Except for this one treatment...

23:12.390 --> 23:15.030
Did he tell you about that?

23:15.090 --> 23:17.760
No,he hasn't been the most forthcoming ghost.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.760
We think he's trying to protect your privacy.

23:19.830 --> 23:22.160
So tell me about the treatment.

23:22.230 --> 23:25.230
It really doesn't matter.

23:25.290 --> 23:29.930
It's really expensive,and my insurance doesn't cover it,so...

23:29.990 --> 23:32.160
Do you have any family or anyone who could help?

23:32.230 --> 23:34.360
Yes,I have a lot of family.

23:34.430 --> 23:36.630
Parents and younger sisters

23:36.690 --> 23:39.290
And they would do anything they could, bleed themselves dry,

23:39.360 --> 23:40.990
And I can't have that,ok?

23:41.060 --> 23:43.790
It's not worth it.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.290
I'm not worth it.

23:46.360 --> 23:47.330
What do you mean?

23:47.390 --> 23:49.730
It's too late,ok?

23:49.790 --> 23:51.930
Can you just tell him that?

23:51.990 --> 23:56.030
It's hard, and it hurts too much.

23:56.090 --> 23:57.460
The best thing that Rick can do for me

23:57.530 --> 24:00.690
Is to find some peace for himself.

24:05.790 --> 24:08.260
I told him, call a plumber,

24:08.330 --> 24:10.590
But no,he had to fix the pipe by himself.

24:10.660 --> 24:13.630
Goes and falls off a ladder.

24:15.690 --> 24:17.300
- Hey,uh... buddy...  - Wait.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.830
Look,I'm sorry, but if he was welding

24:19.890 --> 24:21.130
And he's allergic to the chemicals in the flux,

24:21.190 --> 24:23.460
- He could be heading into...  - Anaphylactic shock?

24:23.530 --> 24:26.360
Thanks for the tip. We got it covered.

24:27.330 --> 24:29.160
Right.

24:29.230 --> 24:31.630
Sorry to butt in.

24:36.860 --> 24:38.690
Sam?

24:38.760 --> 24:41.590
Sam?

24:41.660 --> 24:43.790
How about that? 2 times in one day.

24:43.860 --> 24:45.690
Got a way of showing up, don't you?

24:45.760 --> 24:46.530
Sorry.

24:46.690 --> 24:49.360
Now I remember where I know you from... the other accident,

24:49.430 --> 24:50.790
The one the kid fell off the roof.

24:50.860 --> 24:52.830
Right,with the broken arm.

24:52.890 --> 24:54.860
Right,which you happened to know a lot about setting,

24:54.930 --> 24:56.290
I mean,for a civilian.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.860
And now this guy needing adrenalin.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.360
I do a lot of welding,so...

24:59.430 --> 25:00.830
Is that what it is?

25:00.890 --> 25:05.160
You're not some kind of crash junkie,are you?

25:06.990 --> 25:08.490
No.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.760
Look,it's hard to explain,but...

25:10.830 --> 25:14.890
I promise it won't happen again. Sorry.

25:17.990 --> 25:20.390
It's just that,

25:20.460 --> 25:21.930
You gotta know, Melinda's husband...

25:21.990 --> 25:24.990
He was a friend of mine.

25:29.030 --> 25:30.260
Is he ok?

25:30.330 --> 25:33.390
Gonna be fine. Just keep breathing.

25:38.030 --> 25:40.160
I get where Morgan's coming from.

25:40.230 --> 25:43.060
It's brutal. I mean,the side effects of the drugs

25:43.130 --> 25:44.090
Can be worse than the illness.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.890
So that's what you're researching?

25:45.960 --> 25:47.490
No,I'm trying to find her family.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.090
Why?

25:49.090 --> 25:50.290
I think they should know about her illness.

25:50.360 --> 25:52.020
You know,maybe they can convince her to get treatment.

25:52.090 --> 25:53.720
Our ghost can move on, and who knows,

25:53.790 --> 25:55.020
Maybe Morgan will get better.

25:55.090 --> 25:56.690
Yeah,well, what about her privacy?

25:56.760 --> 25:58.960
Or doctor-patient confidentiality?

25:59.020 --> 26:01.660
She's not my patient.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.890
But even if she were, I'd have to weigh my responsibility

26:03.960 --> 26:05.260
To contact the next of kin.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.020
I think she's dangerously depressed.

26:07.090 --> 26:08.620
And a liar.

26:08.690 --> 26:09.190
What?

26:09.260 --> 26:12.860
Look,Morgan's parents died in 2002.

26:12.920 --> 26:15.220
"June and Bill Jefferies leave behind their only daughter Morgan,

26:15.290 --> 26:17.720
16,a student at Melbrook High."

26:17.790 --> 26:19.820
16. That's young.

26:19.890 --> 26:21.190
And she was worried about her family...

26:21.260 --> 26:23.860
Her parents,sisters... not wanting to drain them dry.

26:23.920 --> 26:27.020
Well,maybe she found another family

26:27.090 --> 26:28.990
Who adopted her and they maybe had sisters,too.

26:29.060 --> 26:30.620
Whoa,back up.

26:32.890 --> 26:35.190
I'll tell you what she found... husband number one.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.620
Schooch.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.220
Ok,a second wedding for both?

26:41.290 --> 26:43.820
Hello,husband number two.

26:43.890 --> 26:46.490
- She's a kid!  - She's 23.

26:46.560 --> 26:47.620
You're trying to find her husband?

26:47.690 --> 26:49.790
My guess is, he'd need to find us.

26:51.320 --> 26:54.160
'Cause he's dead.

26:54.990 --> 26:57.220
They both are.

26:57.290 --> 27:00.860
Both of long-term illnesses. What are the odds of that?

27:00.920 --> 27:02.420
Pretty good,

27:02.490 --> 27:03.960
If she sought them out.

27:04.020 --> 27:06.860
The cancer support groups, that's where she found them.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.720
She's a black widow.

27:27.090 --> 27:28.290
Did you get back into his apartment?

27:28.360 --> 27:30.320
Yeah. The landlord remembered me.

27:30.390 --> 27:32.360
Rick left Morgan a quarter of a million dollars.

27:32.620 --> 27:34.590
She was his death beneficiary?

27:34.660 --> 27:36.120
- How did we miss that?  - We didn't look for it,

27:36.190 --> 27:37.360
And I dug through the files.

27:37.420 --> 27:39.460
So what did you find out at the clinic?

27:40.860 --> 27:43.090
She attended therapy meetings,

27:43.090 --> 27:44.090
But was never a patient.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.790
So she isn't sick now and never was.

27:45.860 --> 27:48.660
Look,it's not like I'm fooled by pretty girls every time.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.360
She seemed so scared.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.790
Yeah,she was. She knew that he was haunting her,

27:51.860 --> 27:53.220
And we proved it.

27:53.290 --> 27:55.520
That's why she kept asking all those questions about the ghost.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.420
Because she didn't know if he knew.

27:57.490 --> 27:59.790
- And now...  - We don't have much time.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.420
It's too late.

28:09.490 --> 28:10.790
She got away.

28:10.860 --> 28:12.520
She's gonna get away with everything.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.560
She took my lemon zester.

28:18.620 --> 28:21.220
What did she get away with of yours?

28:21.290 --> 28:23.020
Did you see Morgan before she left?

28:23.090 --> 28:24.220
Nope.

28:24.290 --> 28:26.390
The building manager said she had some kind of

28:26.460 --> 28:28.020
Family emergency;

28:28.090 --> 28:30.690
One that required a nice garnish, apparently.

28:30.760 --> 28:33.160
You know,we'll just get a forwarding address from the manager.

28:33.220 --> 28:37.190
I tried. He said she gave him 6 months cash in advance,

28:37.260 --> 28:40.060
So he didn't ask her for references.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.020
Pretty girls.

28:43.090 --> 28:44.760
They get away with everything.

28:44.820 --> 28:47.520
- You can say that again.  - I say it all the time.

28:47.590 --> 28:49.260
You never listen.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.990
We haven't met.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.520
No,we haven't. Hi. Melinda.

28:53.890 --> 28:55.060
How nice.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.220
Another lady friend.

29:00.190 --> 29:03.390
How could I have been so dumb?

29:04.260 --> 29:06.060
Rick?

29:07.460 --> 29:10.120
I should have seen it coming.

29:10.190 --> 29:11.860
She lied to you.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.590
Every day.

29:13.660 --> 29:16.520
In group,and afterward when we were together.

29:16.590 --> 29:18.990
She was so young.

29:19.060 --> 29:21.690
I couldn't believe she was dying.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.690
I couldn't believe

29:23.760 --> 29:25.960
That she cared for me.

29:26.020 --> 29:27.720
But she was so convincing.

29:27.790 --> 29:30.090
Did she ask you for the money?

29:30.160 --> 29:31.690
She didn't have to.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.420
Helping her was the most important thing on my list,

29:34.490 --> 29:37.860
So I offered it.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.690
And after that, something changed.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.260
She started pulling away.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.660
Said she felt ill. You know,

29:44.720 --> 29:46.360
The medication was making her so sick.

29:46.420 --> 29:49.160
That's why she needed this other treatment.

29:49.220 --> 29:52.890
This very expensive other treatment.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.960
She got everything she wanted.

29:59.020 --> 30:02.520
The only thing she was sick of is me.

30:02.590 --> 30:05.220
Look,I know that this is painful.

30:05.290 --> 30:08.460
But if you could just forgive...

30:08.520 --> 30:10.660
If you could just let go...

30:10.720 --> 30:12.890
The light, it'll bring you peace.

30:12.960 --> 30:13.860
No!

30:14.620 --> 30:16.590
You don't understand.

30:16.660 --> 30:19.060
I died for nothing.

30:19.120 --> 30:23.520
My life meant nothing to her.

30:23.590 --> 30:27.320
And now her life is nothing to me.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.760
Not that I blame him,

30:31.820 --> 30:33.360
But if he looked half as angry as he sounded...

30:33.360 --> 30:35.090
Yeah,we have to get to Morgan before he does.

30:36.930 --> 30:38.390
You know where Morgan could have gone,

30:38.460 --> 30:40.160
Maybe with friends or family?

30:40.230 --> 30:41.460
I'm sorry,no.

30:41.630 --> 30:43.190
She was a very private person,

30:43.260 --> 30:45.960
Which is partly why it just doesn't make any sense.

30:46.030 --> 30:48.830
Half the time,he was the only one who could get her to share.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.290
Yeah,well, she was just working him.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.790
That was part of the con.

30:51.860 --> 30:53.630
I'm usually a pretty good judge of character.

30:53.690 --> 30:56.260
She married two others shortly before they died.

30:56.330 --> 30:58.230
And we're not sure how many she lied to.

30:58.290 --> 31:01.930
See,that's what doesn't make sense.

31:01.990 --> 31:05.030
I mean,she was just all about conning these guys,

31:05.090 --> 31:08.590
Then why would she leave us all that money with Rick's name on it?

31:08.660 --> 31:10.560
What are you talking about?

31:10.630 --> 31:14.030
Well,the donation. It came into the clinic just last week.

31:14.090 --> 31:15.960
How much did she donate, exactly?

31:16.030 --> 31:17.560
Quarter of a million dollars.

31:17.630 --> 31:20.490
And it could not have come at a better time, either.

31:20.560 --> 31:23.730
She gave away every Penny.

31:24.730 --> 31:26.230
I don't get it, was she a con artist

31:26.290 --> 31:28.290
Or some kind of ambulance chasing Robin Hood?

31:28.360 --> 31:29.990
Yeah,or someone who had a change of heart.

31:30.060 --> 31:32.045
Remember,Rick kept saying that

31:32.045 --> 31:34.030
she would withdraw every time he left,

31:34.090 --> 31:35.890
So maybe her conscience was getting to her.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.630
Hey,you know what else wants to get to her right now?

31:37.790 --> 31:38.660
Our ghost.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.090
And he's M.A.D.,mad.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.790
So if you were her, where would you go?

31:42.860 --> 31:45.760
I don't know. Next small town with a cancer ward.

31:45.830 --> 31:48.130
No,her conscience is getting to her.

31:48.190 --> 31:49.930
She'd be stupid to stick around.

31:49.990 --> 31:51.330
Or maybe not. You know,

31:51.390 --> 31:54.060
I mean,she can run from us, but she can't from Rick.

31:54.130 --> 31:55.190
She knows that his spirit is still here.

31:55.260 --> 31:58.590
Maybe...maybe she's trying to make it up to him.

31:58.660 --> 31:59.830
The list.

31:59.890 --> 32:00.930
Yeah,it's a long shot,

32:00.990 --> 32:03.090
But what hadn't he marked off?

32:03.160 --> 32:05.390
Well,the Denver Omelet did catch my eye,

32:05.460 --> 32:07.460
Only because I tried, and it's very hard

32:07.530 --> 32:09.330
To get the ham and the bell pepper ratio.

32:09.390 --> 32:12.130
A place she could go... In Grandview.

32:15.390 --> 32:17.860
The lunar eclipse.

32:17.930 --> 32:21.830
It's happening right now. That was on the list,right?

32:21.890 --> 32:24.990
Look,everyone is trying to find a place to watch.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.460
- Come on! - The roof!

32:26.530 --> 32:27.960
They used to go up there,together.

33:07.530 --> 33:11.190
There was a time I would have thought you were crying for me.

33:12.230 --> 33:14.690
I believed every lie you told me.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.560
How could I be so stupid?

33:28.390 --> 33:31.530
Help! Please! Help!

33:31.990 --> 33:34.530
Help me,please! Help me.

33:35.590 --> 33:36.560
Help me!

33:51.100 --> 33:52.570
Where is she?

33:52.640 --> 33:54.140
She's finding out what it felt like.

34:06.070 --> 34:07.840
Help me!

34:07.900 --> 34:10.300
Help me,please! Someone!

34:14.100 --> 34:15.340
Please,please!

34:19.199 --> 34:24.250
Hello,hello? Is somebody there? Help!

34:25.170 --> 34:26.300
Morgan?!

34:26.370 --> 34:28.300
- We got you,Morgan.  - Oh! Please help me!

34:28.370 --> 34:29.670
We got you,ok, we got you!

34:29.739 --> 34:30.739
- Hang on! - Please don't drop me!

34:30.800 --> 34:32.139
We won't drop you, you're ok.

34:32.199 --> 34:34.340
- We got you. - Please don't drop me!

34:34.400 --> 34:36.600
We got you. We won't drop you.

34:39.170 --> 34:40.070
It's ok.

34:40.100 --> 34:41.400
You're going to be ok.

34:41.400 --> 34:42.639
It's ok.

34:42.650 --> 34:44.050
That was Rick, wasn't it?

34:44.120 --> 34:45.290
He's trying to kill me!

34:45.350 --> 34:47.090
It's ok,we're here now. He can't hurt you.

34:47.150 --> 34:48.889
I didn't try to kill her.

34:48.949 --> 34:50.250
I tried to teach her.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.620
He's angry.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.420
All right? He wants to punish you.

34:53.489 --> 34:55.449
Do you understand why?

34:56.290 --> 34:57.420
Yeah.

34:57.490 --> 35:00.190
But what can I do? I mean,it's done.

35:00.250 --> 35:02.120
I lied to him.

35:02.190 --> 35:03.350
But why?

35:03.420 --> 35:05.120
Was the money that important to her?

35:05.190 --> 35:07.090
Look,he's here.

35:07.150 --> 35:10.490
Morgan,this is your chance to explain things.

35:17.720 --> 35:20.590
I don't know why I do the things I do.

35:20.650 --> 35:25.220
Ok. But do you understand why this time is different?

35:25.290 --> 35:26.650
But he was different.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.050
I mean,he cared about me.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.620
He really cared about me.

35:31.690 --> 35:32.750
You know?

35:32.820 --> 35:36.490
And he didn't want anything from me,and...

35:38.050 --> 35:40.520
I had never had that before.

35:45.990 --> 35:48.990
Is that true?

35:49.050 --> 35:51.320
I think you had that before.

35:51.390 --> 35:54.490
But they left you,

35:54.550 --> 35:56.290
when you were really young.

35:57.750 --> 36:01.150
This all started after your parents died,right?

36:05.590 --> 36:10.420
There were foster homes and schools I couldn't finish,

36:10.490 --> 36:11.850
And...

36:11.920 --> 36:14.590
I just learned to fight for things.

36:14.650 --> 36:18.750
And then,I guess, just to take them.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.990
Things I had no right to.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.290
People's feelings.

36:26.350 --> 36:30.150
And I know that it doesn't make it right.

36:30.220 --> 36:32.320
It's no excuse, but giving the money back,

36:32.390 --> 36:35.120
It was the only thing I knew to do.

36:35.190 --> 36:38.120
I...I don't understand.

36:39.420 --> 36:40.520
You gave that money away?

36:40.590 --> 36:41.820
All of it.

36:41.890 --> 36:43.950
To a cancer clinic in your name.

36:48.150 --> 36:51.350
It's better than keeping it.

36:51.420 --> 36:53.790
- I still died for a lie.  - What?

36:53.850 --> 36:56.250
- What is he saying?  - I'm not sure.

36:56.320 --> 36:59.620
Yes,she lied. Ok,but she didn't make you sick.

36:59.690 --> 37:01.320
- You died because...  - look,it doesn't matter.

37:01.390 --> 37:02.620
No,it does matter.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.850
It's the reason that you packed your chute wrong that day.

37:08.920 --> 37:11.850
That's how you knew you were going to die so soon.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.920
It wasn't an accident. Was it?

37:16.050 --> 37:18.090
What?

37:19.950 --> 37:21.590
Look...

37:21.650 --> 37:24.390
The doctor told me I didn't have much time.

37:24.450 --> 37:26.490
Weeks,really.

37:28.190 --> 37:29.950
And they would be painful.

37:33.290 --> 37:35.190
She was too young for me.

37:35.250 --> 37:38.050
And really, what chance did we have?

37:41.220 --> 37:43.150
But I loved her.

37:44.590 --> 37:46.220
You did it for her.

37:47.550 --> 37:49.750
That's the last part of the secret,isn't it?

37:49.820 --> 37:51.620
The money.

37:51.690 --> 37:53.890
You knew that if the insurance company knew

37:53.950 --> 37:57.120
you planned your death they wouldn't pay out.

37:57.190 --> 38:00.320
Not in time to help her.

38:00.390 --> 38:02.250
Not soon enough to help her.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.620
Exactly.

38:03.690 --> 38:06.290
He died like that for me?

38:10.190 --> 38:12.420
She was worth it.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.090
She is worth it.

38:18.820 --> 38:21.150
Can you tell her that?

38:21.220 --> 38:22.990
Yeah.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.820
I will.

38:29.090 --> 38:33.550
Guys,I don't want to ruin a beautiful moment,but look.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.890
We talked about this.

38:50.050 --> 38:53.090
The night we watched the sunset up here.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.850
You said that...

39:02.920 --> 39:06.820
You wanted to ride the wind all the way home.

39:08.620 --> 39:11.220
You remembered.

39:15.220 --> 39:18.450
Tell her I'm ready.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.190
He's ready.

39:21.220 --> 39:23.220
To go now.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.550
Ok.

40:19.820 --> 40:22.590
He's gone.

40:22.650 --> 40:24.690
He went into the light.

40:24.750 --> 40:26.990
That light?

40:48.120 --> 40:51.050
There you are. All the lights were off.

40:51.120 --> 40:52.990
I didn't know if you were home.

40:53.050 --> 40:55.490
Yeah,you know, I was,uh,thinking.

40:55.550 --> 40:56.720
Oh,really? About what?

40:56.790 --> 40:58.190
Oh,it's been a weird day.

40:58.250 --> 40:59.790
Ok,so tell me everything.

41:01.050 --> 41:04.390
Well,it was like having my whole life pass before my eyes.

41:04.450 --> 41:07.390
I mean,old friends on the street,my job,

41:07.450 --> 41:09.650
Everything.

41:09.720 --> 41:12.320
Then I realized it's not mine anymore.

41:12.390 --> 41:14.190
I mean, that life is over.

41:14.250 --> 41:16.920
Hey. Don't say that.

41:16.990 --> 41:19.220
Ok? We'll get it back. It might take us some time...

41:19.290 --> 41:20.720
No,it's all right. You know,because...

41:20.790 --> 41:22.690
What if I want something different?

41:22.750 --> 41:26.220
Different? How?

41:27.420 --> 41:29.920
Did I ever tell you why I became a paramedic?

41:29.990 --> 41:31.590
Yeah,'cause you wanted to help people.

41:31.650 --> 41:34.350
Right. But what I really wanted was to become a doctor,

41:34.420 --> 41:36.420
And I just didn't have the patience.

41:36.490 --> 41:38.750
So I took a shortcut.

41:38.820 --> 41:40.450
And as much as I love the work,

41:40.520 --> 41:43.290
I wish that I'd taken the time.

41:43.350 --> 41:46.890
Well,now all you have is time.

41:46.950 --> 41:48.690
I got more than that.

41:50.220 --> 41:53.320
First of all,remember all the annoying prerequisites

41:53.390 --> 41:55.390
For med school I was trying to find space for last year?

41:55.450 --> 41:56.850
- Yeah?  - Yes.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.890
Well,it turns out that I've already studied them.

41:59.950 --> 42:02.220
What are you talking about?

42:02.290 --> 42:03.720
When Sam was getting his architecture degree,

42:03.790 --> 42:05.990
He took all these math and science classes.

42:06.050 --> 42:08.690
These are his college transcripts.

42:08.750 --> 42:11.250
Yeah,which I had faxed over earlier today,

42:11.320 --> 42:12.690
And,I mean,of course I have to study them

42:12.690 --> 42:14.820
So I understand them myself,

42:14.890 --> 42:17.090
But this could save a year.

42:17.150 --> 42:18.320
Med school?

42:18.390 --> 42:20.320
You're gonna go to med school?

42:20.390 --> 42:22.590
Well,if I can get in and if we can figure out a way to pay for it.

42:22.650 --> 42:25.490
Hey,we'll manage.

42:25.550 --> 42:27.290
Yeah.

42:27.350 --> 42:28.990
Yeah.

42:30.420 --> 42:33.450
Do you know the 2 things I've dreamt of most of in my life?

42:33.520 --> 42:35.990
Being a doctor,

42:36.050 --> 42:37.450
And you.

42:37.520 --> 42:42.020
What if I just work hard enough, and if I'm patient....

42:44.090 --> 42:45.750
You don't have to work hard for me,

42:45.820 --> 42:48.720
And you don't have to be patient.

42:53.420 --> 42:55.790
Ah,nobody should be as lucky as me.

42:55.850 --> 42:58.220
Twice in one lifetime.

42:58.290 --> 43:00.520
Actually...

43:00.590 --> 43:02.820
It's more like 2 lifetimes.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
