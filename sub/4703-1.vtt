02:26.355 --> 02:28.813
Wait a minute.
I got another idea.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.432
Here. This one.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.463
She's one of these
big dames, but in proportion.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.487
Has she got class?

02:34.613 --> 02:36.275
Oh, in every way.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.136
I said that,
I would do it. I'll try it.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.241
Do it.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.717
Louie, hit me again.

02:59.554 --> 03:04.345
Uh, hello. Is this Betty?
Um, Betty.. Is this Betty?

03:04.518 --> 03:05.929
Oh, well, I'll tell you.

03:06.103 --> 03:10.347
Uh, my name is-is Joe Clay.
My name is Joe Clay.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.935
I'm a friend of Abe Quine's

03:12.109 --> 03:14.522
and we're here
in the executive suite.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.527
Yeah, Abe Quine.
It's kind of noisy here

03:16.697 --> 03:19.531
but I tell ya he told me that
you are a lovely girl, Betty

03:19.700 --> 03:21.157
and you, uh..

03:21.493 --> 03:24.907
and, uh, he suggested that,
well, you know

03:25.080 --> 03:28.289
you, uh, like to
have a good time.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.747
And, anyway, my agency
is throwing a party

03:31.878 --> 03:33.798
or rather we're inviting
the people for our party

03:33.880 --> 03:37.373
on prince Harun Badul's yacht,
and Abe suggested that

03:37.551 --> 03:40.009
you might be
a very welcome addition.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.795
What, honey?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.430
No, not Abe Badul.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.384
It's Prince Harun Badul.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.723
It's his party on his yacht.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.602
Yes, he's a real prince, dear.

03:53.775 --> 03:57.189
Yeah. Uh-huh.
I thought you would.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.649
Fine. Well, it's berth 23

03:59.906 --> 04:03.240
St. Francis yacht club,
6:30. Right?

04:03.410 --> 04:05.447
Okay and we'll have
a launch there.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.862
All right, bye-bye now.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.823
Magic time.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.338
Here comes number seven.
Let's cast off.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.905
You're late.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.359
You're dressed wrong.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.348
You're supposed to be
a cocktail dress.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.409
You know,
something peekaboo.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.416
You know, sparkle a little.
You call that peekaboo?

04:53.585 --> 04:54.585
Let's go.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.586
Hey, you, wait a minute.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.633
Hey, you! Wait..

05:49.850 --> 05:51.842
Come on, girls.
Come on. Come on.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.018
Hey, you.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.098
Listen, who..

05:55.272 --> 05:57.605
Oh, you must be the new man
from the agency.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.891
Yes, sir. Joe Clay.
You're Mr..

06:00.068 --> 06:01.354
Mr. Trayner.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.440
I see you've already
met my secretary.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.151
Oh, well, not officially.
He was much too busy.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.986
Say, these are fine.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.159
Uh, thank you.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.694
Just fine and dandy.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.910
Well... hello there.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.744
Can I buy you a drink?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.875
Oh, no, thank you.
I don't drink.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.877
Look, uh, I'm sorry
about mistaking you

07:06.051 --> 07:08.043
for one of the other
uh, girls.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.211
So you're the new
public relations man.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.668
- Yeah.
- What happened to Eddie?

07:12.724 --> 07:13.885
Eddie quit.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.850
We liked him.
Why'd he quit?

07:19.606 --> 07:23.145
Well, a little matter of...
personal integrity.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.483
Eddie didn't feel
that getting dates

07:28.657 --> 07:31.570
for potentates was part
of public relations.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.701
But isn't it?

07:35.413 --> 07:37.780
Well, there's a name for it,
but it's not public relations.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.414
Well, whatever it is,
you seem to do it very well.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.426
Oh, boy, wait a minute!

08:00.689 --> 08:01.969
Now, you counted twice
over here.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.307
Wait a minute!
No, there's only four girls!

08:04.484 --> 08:06.020
We had seven!
Wait a minute!

08:06.194 --> 08:09.153
Hey, don't move out!
We got two girls missing!

08:09.322 --> 08:10.984
Wait a minute!
There's two...

08:11.616 --> 08:14.700
Two of my girls
are missing up there!

08:14.869 --> 08:17.737
Two of the young ladies
aren't quite ready to leave.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.456
Aren't quite ready.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.284
I guess I can be congratulated
on a job well done.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.951
Well done. Well done.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.174
Everybody here?

09:34.866 --> 09:36.198
Hi.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.780
Mr. Trayner isn't here.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.991
That's a bit of luck.
You're the one I came to see.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.701
Look, I felt
we should be friends.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.868
So... hello there.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.708
Excuse me. I have to meet
Mr. Trayner at a board meeting.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.721
Look, we sort of got started
on the wrong foot.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.962
It was sort of my fau...

09:57.097 --> 09:58.759
Anyway, I brought
a peace offering.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.015
- Why?
- Why?

10:01.184 --> 10:03.471
Well, because it..

10:10.318 --> 10:14.403
Now, look, we're going to be
working together sort of, huh?

10:14.572 --> 10:16.780
I mean, from...

10:16.950 --> 10:19.033
I'll be up to see the boss
from time to time.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.444
Mr. Clay, that is
your name, isn't it?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.221
Mr. Trayner is the one
you have to please

10:23.331 --> 10:26.119
and he seems very happy
with what you've done so far.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.621
Well, supposing
I wanted to please you.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.627
There's no reason
for you to please me.

10:34.509 --> 10:35.875
Peanut brittle.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.512
Look, you're forcing me to
be rude. I hate peanut brittle.

10:40.974 --> 10:41.974
Excuse me.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.183
Goodnight, Gladys.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.050
Goodnight, Miss Arnesen.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.476
Do you like peanut brittle?

11:23.558 --> 11:24.558
Down?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.764
Getting back to what
people do for a living,

11:52.837 --> 11:53.795
can I ask you a question

11:53.796 --> 11:56.504
that might embarrass you
just a little, hmm?

11:57.342 --> 12:01.336
What spec... what special
qualifications do you feel

12:01.512 --> 12:02.698
that you have for a job
that allows you

12:02.722 --> 12:05.180
to sit around all day
and chat with the boss?

12:05.350 --> 12:06.761
I've heard about your job.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.302
Maybe answer a few
personal letters for him

12:09.479 --> 12:11.892
and accompany him
to parties, hmm?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.705
Spend half your working day
reading a book

12:13.858 --> 12:15.377
while two typists who
get less money than you

12:15.401 --> 12:17.609
do all the work, hmm?

12:18.363 --> 12:20.446
That reminds me,
I forgot my book.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.621
She always carries that book.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.747
I'll tell you what special
qualifications you have.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.245
You're pretty. That's what
special qualifications you have.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.696
That old lech loves
to have you around

12:42.720 --> 12:45.258
to look at and lean on
when he gets drunk

12:45.431 --> 12:47.468
like he did last night,
and who knows what else?

12:47.642 --> 12:50.350
That's what special
qualifications you have.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.948
Oh, uh..

13:13.376 --> 13:14.833
Uh, listen..

13:15.920 --> 13:18.503
I am sorry, and I
shouldn't have said that.

13:18.673 --> 13:21.837
I, uh, I came up here
to try and be friends.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.218
I was going to ask you
to have dinner with me.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.473
Peanut brittle?
I think you must be

13:29.642 --> 13:32.931
the silliest man I've ever met.
Peanut brittle?

13:33.938 --> 13:36.271
Well, I guess you're right.
Let's forget it, huh?

14:06.888 --> 14:08.220
Goodnight.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.550
Goodnight.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.476
Mr. Clay?

14:19.275 --> 14:22.768
I-I thought you were
going to ask me to dinner.

14:22.945 --> 14:23.945
Well, I was. I...

14:23.988 --> 14:26.196
Well, why don't you?

14:27.241 --> 14:30.860
Uh, I mean, my board meeting
won't be over till 7:30.

14:31.037 --> 14:34.121
So I-I wouldn't have time
to change or anything.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.907
It would have to be
some place kind of casual.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.872
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.587
I know just the spot.
Place Pigalle.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.749
I'll meet you there at 7:30.
You'll love it.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.219
Okay.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.384
7:30.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.142
At a board meeting,
can you imagine?

15:03.319 --> 15:06.903
With all those big old jowly men
staring at me, Mr. Trayner says

15:07.073 --> 15:08.689
"No, I couldn't
get along without her.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.506
"She's always right there
when I need her.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.492
"Especially when I've had
a couple too many.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.199
Takes care of me
like a little mother."

15:15.373 --> 15:19.708
Then he gives me one of those
special proprietary hugs of his

15:20.753 --> 15:23.621
and I suddenly realized
I owe you an apology.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.085
Oh, I'm just as
bad as you are.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.093
I mean, I-I guess
everybody swallows his pride

15:29.262 --> 15:30.969
once in a while
on account of his job.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.386
I had no business saying that
to you in the first place.

15:35.560 --> 15:40.271
Um... hit me again. Not you.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.648
Anything for the lady?

15:41.691 --> 15:42.898
No, nothing.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.152
What do you got
against booze, anyway?

15:47.405 --> 15:49.613
Oh, I just don't much
see the point in it.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.990
Point? Well,
it makes you feel good.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.276
I already feel good.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.693
Anyway, I don't like the taste.

15:54.745 --> 15:55.745
What do you like?

15:55.872 --> 15:57.283
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate?

15:57.623 --> 16:00.331
Chocolate.
I'm practically nutty about it.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.372
Oh, wait a minute.
Hold everything.

16:02.545 --> 16:03.545
Uh...

16:09.260 --> 16:10.260
What did you do?

16:10.344 --> 16:11.344
You'll see.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.115
I think we should order,
don't you?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.380
In a few minutes.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.467
Kirsten Arnesen.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.539
No wonder you're so tough
to get along with.

16:20.563 --> 16:21.599
You're not even American.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.440
Did you ever drive down the
Peninsula toward San Mateo?

16:26.235 --> 16:29.273
Arnesen nursery, that's us.
That was us.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.530
I-I just couldn't take it.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.155
Oh, my father's
a wonderful man, a good man.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.787
but I kept thinking
to myself, "you're pretty."

16:38.956 --> 16:40.618
"You're pretty,
and here you are."

16:41.417 --> 16:42.908
oh, girls know
when they're pretty.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.120
And there I was, blushing unseen

16:46.297 --> 16:48.789
wasting my sweetness
on the desert air.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.332
Gray's "Elegy."

16:51.886 --> 16:53.252
Did you get that
out of this book?

16:53.429 --> 16:54.545
Oh, no, not this one.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.763
That's volume je-la.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.674
Gray's out of volume go-ja.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.473
"World library
of great literature,

17:06.651 --> 17:10.065
Volume five, je to la.
Je-la."

17:12.198 --> 17:14.440
My father gave me those
for my high school graduation.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.030
And he said if I read
all the way from a-bu to ya-zu

17:17.203 --> 17:19.194
it would be the equivalent
of a college education.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.827
Je-la, that puts you about the
middle of your sophomore year.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.334
Ah.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.454
Oh, no, thank you.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.211
No, no, that's all right.
That's fine.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.172
They're special for you.
It's chocolate. Go on, try it.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.847
Oh, it's good.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.100
It is.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.228
Ooh, very.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.720
Yeah, see what I mean?

17:45.189 --> 17:46.976
Brandy Alexander,
they call that.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.726
Say now.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.368
All right, would you
wait a minute?

18:08.879 --> 18:11.963
Joe, it's more beautiful
than ever tonight.

18:12.383 --> 18:13.669
You know something?

18:13.843 --> 18:15.803
You were absolutely right
about that brandy thing.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.011
Alexander.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.173
About it making me feel good,

18:18.306 --> 18:19.616
What are you, chicken?

18:19.640 --> 18:20.721
and I feel wonderful.

18:20.891 --> 18:24.225
You don't feel like asking me
up for a cup of coffee?

18:24.395 --> 18:26.011
Some other time, Joe.
Do you mind?

18:26.814 --> 18:28.414
Anyway, I'm not
quite ready to go up yet.

18:28.566 --> 18:29.846
You want to walk down
to the bay?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.726
Well, why not, Huh?

18:36.073 --> 18:38.486
Let, um...
you do very good work.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.868
Well, there goes
another boatload

18:50.046 --> 18:51.753
out to the prince's yacht.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.209
Another load of anxious...

18:56.886 --> 18:59.253
Ew. I don't see how you can
drink that stuff like that

18:59.430 --> 19:01.296
right out of the bottle,
it must taste awful.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.261
Well, anything
worth having is worth

19:03.893 --> 19:05.885
suffering for, isn't it?

19:06.812 --> 19:08.178
I guess so.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.850
Oh, I like to watch the water.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.757
If you look close, it's filthy

19:16.781 --> 19:21.401
but I like to look further out
where it's clean.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.361
You know what I think?

19:24.497 --> 19:25.829
Hmm?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.206
I think I watch
the water because..

19:29.418 --> 19:32.286
...I expect a sea monster to
come up out of there someday

19:32.463 --> 19:34.955
and carry me down
to the ocean caves.

19:35.132 --> 19:39.843
Mm-hmm. Mom and dad
are a club act.

19:41.263 --> 19:46.054
You know, I mean songs
and dances and snappy patter.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.764
Old-time Vaudeville.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.772
And they're in some loud joint
in Vegas right this minute.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.269
Are they good?

19:55.861 --> 19:59.104
You know, they were on "Ed
Sullivan" a couple years ago.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.031
But you didn't like
that kind of life, huh?

20:04.870 --> 20:10.161
No. I wanted something steady,
something with a little class

20:10.334 --> 20:13.077
like the Trayner
drilling account class.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.204
Joe, don't hate yourself.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.669
It's something you've got to do.
It's part of your job.

20:19.927 --> 20:23.216
No, I want to be a public
relations man, not a pimp!

20:26.809 --> 20:29.768
My-My job is supposed
to be to advise people

20:29.937 --> 20:32.429
how to relate
to the public, you know?

20:32.606 --> 20:37.772
How-How to... make the good
that my client does known

20:37.903 --> 20:42.273
and-and how to help him
find ways to do good

20:42.450 --> 20:45.909
and-and benefit others
as well as himself.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.030
I could be
a garbage man, you know?

20:50.207 --> 20:52.073
A eunuch in a harem.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.328
I'm going to tell
the agency, I tell you.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.501
So I burden you with it.
Well, that's great.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.044
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.678
I don't mind.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.761
Short story...

21:11.896 --> 21:14.309
Man meets girl, hmm?

21:15.274 --> 21:16.435
Beautiful...

21:17.276 --> 21:18.392
Sweet...

21:19.862 --> 21:20.943
Nice.

21:22.198 --> 21:25.282
Much too nice for him,
I'll tell you, no, this..

21:25.451 --> 21:28.239
Only kind of girl you really
should bother about, hmm?

21:29.997 --> 21:36.119
Finally, after...
numerous strategical blunders.

21:37.671 --> 21:40.004
He manages to get a date

21:40.549 --> 21:43.758
and he walks her down
to the bay under the stars

21:43.928 --> 21:45.715
and he gets himself loaded

21:45.888 --> 21:47.845
and he cries on her shoulder
like a baby.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.639
Some lover, huh?

21:50.267 --> 21:52.725
Joe, I'm enjoying
being here with you.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.429
After all, you've helped me
avoid my apartment

21:55.606 --> 21:57.222
for the longest possible time

21:57.399 --> 21:59.641
and that's an accomplishment
itself, you know.

21:59.819 --> 22:03.233
The roach kingdom, the whole
building, the whole block.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.675
Do you know that if you don't
leave food out for those roaches

22:05.699 --> 22:06.899
you can't get in the building?

22:07.368 --> 22:09.701
They just pick you up,
carry you into the street

22:09.870 --> 22:11.486
and change the lock on the door.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.658
Roach kingdom.

22:17.169 --> 22:21.413
You know, sometimes I come
down here at night alone

22:21.590 --> 22:25.925
and look at the water,
just to keep from going home.

22:26.095 --> 22:27.095
Yeah.

22:28.097 --> 22:30.297
Well, you don't-you can't
come down here alone at night.

22:30.391 --> 22:33.930
This place is crawling
with all kinds of oddballs.

22:34.395 --> 22:37.684
Oh, they walk by me real slow
sometimes and stare

22:37.857 --> 22:39.849
but they don't do anything.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.025
I don't know why.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.354
Oh, these-you're..

22:46.031 --> 22:46.947
You know something?

22:46.949 --> 22:50.283
I-I dreamt one time
they murdered me...

22:52.538 --> 22:54.780
Over there behind those pilings

22:55.916 --> 22:57.748
and my father came
all the way in

22:57.918 --> 22:59.409
from the Peninsula
in his pickup truck

22:59.587 --> 23:01.874
to take my body home.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.793
And all the way home, he talked-

23:08.262 --> 23:10.379
talked a blue streak
all the way home.

23:11.307 --> 23:14.345
But I was dead and I couldn't
hear him, couldn't answer him.

23:17.187 --> 23:22.273
And the strange thing is
my father doesn't talk.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.602
Oh, he used to talk
to my mother.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.904
When I was a little girl,
he'd-he'd talk to her

23:28.073 --> 23:31.111
in a low, low voice after
I'd gone to bed at night.

23:32.703 --> 23:35.241
But in the daytime,
they hardly talked at all.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.532
They had a very..

23:40.336 --> 23:42.168
...private love affair.

23:43.088 --> 23:46.832
Their favorite toast to each
other was <i>tilsammen I himmelen.</i>

23:47.426 --> 23:48.384
Huh?

23:48.385 --> 23:50.752
In Norwegian, that means
"together in heaven."

23:50.971 --> 23:52.758
<i>To-somonon himlen?</i>

23:52.932 --> 23:54.468
<i>Tilsammen I himmelen.</i>

23:54.642 --> 23:55.928
<i>To-somony himlen.</i>

23:56.101 --> 23:57.842
Get the lilt.
<i>Tilsammen I himmelen.</i>

23:58.020 --> 23:59.727
<i>Tilsammen I himmelen.</i>

24:00.606 --> 24:01.892
Together in heaven.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.478
They meant it, too.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.940
After mama died, he was
more silent than ever...

24:11.867 --> 24:13.449
Almost as though
he'd gone with her.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.371
Oh, well, well..

24:19.750 --> 24:21.616
...gather ye rosebuds
while ye may.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.077
Oh.

24:24.254 --> 24:28.669
Ooh... a little coup-
<i>coup de grace.</i>

24:29.426 --> 24:31.588
Would you believe
it's 2 o'clock?

24:35.891 --> 24:39.180
Ooh... time does not exist
in the ocean.

24:39.353 --> 24:41.436
Well, it will
in the office tomorrow.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.398
I commend thee to the deep.

24:51.907 --> 24:55.150
They are not long,
the days of wine and roses.

24:57.204 --> 25:00.697
Out of a misty dream,
our path emerges for a while

25:01.667 --> 25:03.704
then closes within a dream.

25:19.685 --> 25:23.429
I-I guess... we should be
getting back, huh?

25:39.288 --> 25:40.449
- He come in?
- Yes, sir.

25:44.418 --> 25:45.534
Brad, come in.

25:46.837 --> 25:48.874
Trayner's been trying
to get you all morning.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.415
Well, this is one of those
mornings I couldn't make it.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.132
Oh, those things happen.

25:53.302 --> 25:54.964
He's praising you
to the skies, Joe.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.137
Oh, thanks.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.450
That prince what's-his-name was
so pleased with the whole thing

25:58.474 --> 26:00.807
that Trayner wants to throw
another party tomorrow night.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.888
Wai-wha-
Tomorrow night?

26:03.062 --> 26:06.271
Better call him about it and
congrats on a very happy client.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.898
Look, Brad, could I talk
to you for a minute?

26:09.234 --> 26:10.270
Shoot.

26:10.444 --> 26:14.108
Uh, well, I don't know
how to start it.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.739
I know the Trayner thing
has to be done, you know

26:16.909 --> 26:19.868
arrangements like this have to
be made from time to time but..

26:20.037 --> 26:22.029
But you'd rather not.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.017
Well, I realize
it's part of my job.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.577
It makes you feel dirty.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.228
Well, I don't blame you
for a minute, Joe.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.289
But I don't know what
I can do about it.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.125
Unless we put
another man on there.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.041
Could do that.

26:35.469 --> 26:38.052
Some of the boys don't
mind that sort of thing.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.222
Hey, look, I don't mean
I can't do it. I can do it.

26:40.307 --> 26:43.425
That isn't what I meant.
It isn't that. I just-it-I...

26:43.602 --> 26:46.936
You'd rather not.
Well, let's see now.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.515
Look, not that I won't do it.

26:49.691 --> 26:52.058
It's just the first
account of any size

26:52.236 --> 26:53.356
that you guys have given me.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.695
I think I've got a flash.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.318
Nell, get me
Roger Acton, will you?

27:01.995 --> 27:03.281
That's right.

27:04.873 --> 27:08.457
If Roger goes along with this,
we've got your problem solved

27:08.627 --> 27:09.585
to everyone's advantage.

27:09.586 --> 27:13.421
I don't want this to look
like I'm, uh, complaining.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.790
I just started on the account.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.754
Now, Roger may take
a dim view of this.

27:16.927 --> 27:19.419
Oh, no, no. He'll admire
your integrity, if anything.

27:19.596 --> 27:20.596
Believe me.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.100
Yes?

27:24.476 --> 27:25.762
Thanks, Nell.

27:25.936 --> 27:28.428
Rog, got a little
prob here with Joe.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.231
We put him on that
Trayner drilling account.

27:31.775 --> 27:32.775
Yeah.

27:32.943 --> 27:34.703
Says he heard Trayner
was delighted with you.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.649
Well, here's the prob, Rog.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.526
Oh, that's it exactly.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.111
Says same deal as Eddie, huh?

27:42.244 --> 27:43.860
Oh, he knows
someone's got to, Rog

27:44.037 --> 27:45.932
but let me pull something
out of a hat and we'll see

27:45.956 --> 27:47.288
if it hops for us.

27:47.875 --> 27:48.991
Joe?

27:49.168 --> 27:50.659
- Yeah?
- Hi.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.452
- Hi.
- Come on up.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.463
What in the world
are you carrying?

27:55.632 --> 27:57.999
Oh, just a few things
to go with dinner.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.384
Here. I'll help you.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.381
I was afraid you'd forgotten.

28:01.555 --> 28:04.093
I'm sorry I'm late,
but I was very, very busy

28:04.391 --> 28:05.802
having a couple
with my new client.

28:05.976 --> 28:08.309
Your new.. You didn't.

28:08.478 --> 28:09.998
You mean, you're off
the Trayner drilling account?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.138
Yeah, I am.

28:11.315 --> 28:12.806
Oh, you're a man of principle.

28:12.983 --> 28:16.567
Yeah. Of course, I.. Oh.

28:17.237 --> 28:20.105
I may wish I was back
getting girls for Trayner.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.615
This new guy Ballefoy-murder.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.262
He drinks with both hands.
You can't keep up with him.

28:24.286 --> 28:25.993
You can't communicate.
Thank you.

28:26.163 --> 28:29.281
Hey, this is it, huh?
This is the roach kingdom?

28:29.458 --> 28:30.894
You're feeling pretty good
tonight, aren't you?

28:30.918 --> 28:33.956
Oh, you'll catch up in no time.
Brandy Alexanders.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.837
I got all the makings of the
brandy and the crème de cacao.

28:37.007 --> 28:38.407
We got all the
natural accoutrements

28:38.467 --> 28:39.467
to a home-cooked meal.

28:43.805 --> 28:44.966
You know what's in there?

28:45.432 --> 28:46.432
No.

28:49.895 --> 28:53.309
A chocolate cake
with chocolate icing.

28:55.317 --> 28:57.775
And, oh, here's champagne
to go with the meal

28:58.237 --> 29:01.480
and for me, plain,
unassuming, solid-citizen-type

29:01.657 --> 29:05.617
man of... principle that I am..
the holy comforts of soda and..

29:05.786 --> 29:07.823
Where is it? Ah, scotch.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.407
Now, oh.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.447
This is the roach kingdom, huh?

29:11.625 --> 29:15.244
This is the place where
the roaches reign supreme?

29:15.420 --> 29:16.296
Yes.

29:16.297 --> 29:18.709
Uh-huh. Well, we'll
just see about that.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.752
This is war.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.212
You really are too much.

29:22.386 --> 29:25.720
I just don't believe
in letting

29:25.889 --> 29:27.569
these subversive little
elements take over.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.431
Man of principle,
I salute you.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.184
Salute me with some of that
stuff and go easy on the soda.

29:32.354 --> 29:35.222
Come on, cockroaches.
You come out, wherever you are.

29:35.399 --> 29:37.140
<i>♪♪ You're going to go
to cockroach heaven ♪♪</i>

29:37.317 --> 29:39.434
<i>♪♪ You little dirty
la da dee ♪♪</i>

29:41.863 --> 29:44.355
You-You know something funny?

29:44.741 --> 29:45.701
What?

29:45.702 --> 29:48.910
I didn't really quit
the Trayner account.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.286
- But I...
- Oh, I'm off it, all right.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.408
I just hinted that it was
a little distasteful

29:54.584 --> 29:56.246
and they took me
right off, but..

29:56.837 --> 29:57.837
Well?

29:57.921 --> 30:00.834
What bothers me
is that I didn't..

30:01.383 --> 30:04.592
...demand to be taken off
or even ask to be taken off.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.593
I just hinted, you know.

30:06.972 --> 30:09.430
I mean, I practically
apologized for even hinting.

30:09.599 --> 30:10.715
What do you think of that?

30:12.561 --> 30:16.976
Well, well, Joe,
at least you hinted.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.029
Most people in your position
wouldn't even hint.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.687
They'd be too insecure.

30:20.861 --> 30:21.861
Here.

30:22.237 --> 30:26.823
Oh, to men of principle,
wherever they may be.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.406
Oh, hi, Dottie.

30:31.621 --> 30:33.237
What, are you
spraying in there?

30:33.582 --> 30:35.323
Spray..
Oh, yes, we are.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.538
Well, now, you ought
not to do that.

30:38.712 --> 30:40.472
You get them all stirred up.
What's the good?

30:40.547 --> 30:41.583
Now you made a mess.

30:41.757 --> 30:44.340
You got to think about
other people, you know?

30:44.509 --> 30:47.092
Well, I mean, look,
I don't like to complain

30:47.262 --> 30:48.798
but, I mean,
this is ridiculous.

30:49.264 --> 30:52.428
They don't bother anybody.
They don't destroy anything.

30:52.642 --> 30:53.476
You know they're there.

30:53.477 --> 30:54.829
You leave them alone.
They leave you alone.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.331
You lock up what you
don't want crawled over.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.582
And that's that.
But, all of a sudden,

30:57.606 --> 31:00.474
you start spraying that stuff in
the walls and look at the mess.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.858
What are you trying to do
up there? Run everybody out?

31:03.028 --> 31:04.564
Hey, somebody
spraying up there?

31:04.738 --> 31:07.697
I'm nearly choking
to death down here.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.199
You just come in
off the prairie or something?

31:10.369 --> 31:11.763
People living
in apartment buildings

31:11.787 --> 31:14.245
got to learn to leave
roaches alone.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.414
Now, look, you should see
what they're doing to us.

31:19.461 --> 31:21.181
What's the matter
with you people?

31:23.131 --> 31:24.918
Who's the clown
with the spray can?

31:27.344 --> 31:28.880
What am I supposed to do?

31:29.054 --> 31:31.171
I mean, you've
got them all mad.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.180
They're all-
all crazy, you know.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.467
Well, I-I..

31:35.644 --> 31:37.852
I'm sorry. Well, I..

31:47.447 --> 31:50.110
- Didn't I tell you?
- Hmm?

31:50.826 --> 31:53.443
You've undermined
the whole basic metabolism

31:53.620 --> 31:54.952
of the building.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.998
I'm warning you, Joe.
You better..

32:00.293 --> 32:01.409
What?

32:02.379 --> 32:04.120
You better, you..

32:04.548 --> 32:05.755
What?

32:06.758 --> 32:09.546
You better grow a beard
and move out of town

32:09.719 --> 32:14.180
because-because
those roaches saw you

32:14.349 --> 32:15.885
and the word will..

32:22.149 --> 32:24.857
The word, the word will spread.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.892
And if they ever
track you down..

32:30.157 --> 32:31.318
What?

32:32.284 --> 32:33.991
You'll be a goner.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.734
Oh, darling.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.158
How do I look?

33:58.328 --> 33:59.328
Gorgeous.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.244
And guilty?

34:09.965 --> 34:10.965
Kirstie.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.420
Daddy, I've brought
somebody by to meet you.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.717
I know it's late
and I'm sorry to wake you up.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.050
It was just so important,
it couldn't wait.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.340
Come in.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.219
Uh, Daddy,
this is Joe Clay.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.398
Sir.

34:28.108 --> 34:30.690
Sorry we woke you up,
Mr. Arnesen.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.020
Let's go sit
in the kitchen, Kirstie.

34:35.489 --> 34:37.152
Kitchen is Daddy's
favorite room.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.447
I know this is kind of
a funny time of night

34:40.620 --> 34:42.077
to be introducing
people, Daddy,

34:42.246 --> 34:46.161
but Joe and I... I was
anxious for him to meet you

34:46.333 --> 34:48.667
and we were out driving.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.167
Well, you know how I do things
on the spur of the moment.

34:52.340 --> 34:53.860
I hope you don't mind
us waking you up.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.925
Have a seat.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.379
Oh, thank you.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.171
How have you been, Kirstie?

35:00.348 --> 35:02.385
Oh, that's Daddy's way
of letting me know

35:02.559 --> 35:03.800
I haven't called him
this week.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.343
I've been very busy, Daddy.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.480
What kind of work you do?

35:10.650 --> 35:12.937
Uh, public relations, sir.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.522
Public relations?

35:14.696 --> 35:18.155
Uh, you know, Daddy, it's-
it's hard to explain.

35:18.325 --> 35:22.569
Well, I suppose you might
say my job is, uh...

35:22.746 --> 35:28.117
to sort of help my client, uh...
create a public image.

35:29.836 --> 35:35.298
Well, for an example, uh, let's
say my client, corporation "X"

35:35.467 --> 35:38.801
does some good or something
of benefit to the public

35:39.179 --> 35:42.217
or something that could
conceivably be conceived

35:42.390 --> 35:45.849
as of, uh... benefit to the pu..

35:46.019 --> 35:50.059
Well, my job is to see
that the public knows it.

35:52.275 --> 35:55.518
And what if this "X" corporation
does something bad?

35:58.531 --> 35:59.531
Well..

36:00.825 --> 36:03.533
Well, theoretically,
they don't.

36:04.204 --> 36:05.445
Theoretically.

36:05.622 --> 36:08.831
Uh, well, part of my job
always is... uh

36:09.000 --> 36:15.247
to, um, help my, uh, client
to think of ways to operate

36:15.423 --> 36:18.962
in a way that the public
would, you know, approve.

36:20.637 --> 36:23.755
But if your "X" corporation
makes a mistake

36:23.932 --> 36:25.548
and the thing turns out bad?

36:27.018 --> 36:32.559
Well, uh... I guess then
I try to make it look

36:32.732 --> 36:34.940
not quite so bad.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.046
Well, there's more to it
than that, sir.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.027
It's terrifically
complicated, Daddy.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.573
I don't understand
that kind of work.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.872
You love my girl?

36:57.006 --> 36:58.292
Yes, sir, very much.

37:00.260 --> 37:02.343
Your mama and daddy
live in San Francisco?

37:02.637 --> 37:04.219
- No, sir. They...
- Uh, no.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.927
Joe's mother and father are
in show business, daddy.

37:07.100 --> 37:10.218
They have a-a wonderful act,
I mean, I've never seen it

37:10.395 --> 37:13.513
but from what Joe tells me
they were on "Ed Sullivan."

37:13.690 --> 37:14.806
You might have seen them.

37:17.444 --> 37:18.980
This girl had a fine mama.

37:21.531 --> 37:24.615
Her mama taught her how to
be good, come home early.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.284
I know she remembers
those things.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.242
These days girls think
they have to live in town

37:33.042 --> 37:35.409
but still she
remembers those things.

37:35.879 --> 37:39.043
Well, she's the finest girl
I ever met, Mr. Arnesen.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.129
Look, Mr. Arnesen...

37:43.303 --> 37:45.716
Uh, Daddy,
Joe and I have to go.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.846
We both have to work tomorrow.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.884
Oh. Sure.

37:51.060 --> 37:54.144
Uh, we, uh, hated
to wake you up.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.516
I'm glad you
came by, Kirstie.

37:58.902 --> 38:02.816
Daddy... I hope you like him.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.275
Don't put him on the spot.

38:04.866 --> 38:07.279
Takes time
to find that out, Kirstie.

38:08.953 --> 38:09.972
Nice to have met you, sir.

38:09.996 --> 38:10.996
Same here, Joe.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.763
Daddy, maybe I could
take Joe out this way

38:13.792 --> 38:15.124
and show him the greenhouse.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.000
I'll put on the big light.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.814
Gee, I never knew
there were so many flowers.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.556
Goodnight, Daddy.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.077
- Goodnight, Kirstie.
- Goodnight, sir.

38:31.184 --> 38:32.184
Goodnight, Joe.

38:46.908 --> 38:49.070
Oh, brother,
did I goof that one.

38:49.244 --> 38:50.655
He made me so nervous, I..

39:11.432 --> 39:12.468
Uh, Mr. Arnesen..

39:12.642 --> 39:15.385
...Kirsten and I were married
about two hours ago.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.412
You know what
I'd like to do?

39:41.170 --> 39:44.129
I'd like to go some nice place
and have a drink.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.991
Where is my little gal,
huh? Where is she?

40:17.165 --> 40:18.246
In here.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.416
Okay.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.960
There she is.
I got all the groceries.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.499
Oh, thanks.
You saved me a trip.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.381
And how are you today?
I got you crazy lotion.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.417
She says, "I'm nice
and dry, temporarily."

40:30.595 --> 40:32.211
With the skin
you love to bite.

40:34.057 --> 40:36.174
You're something.
You are really something.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.387
I got to get to work.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.600
Ballefoy is having a bash
for some of the new guys.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.389
You wouldn't want
to go, would you?

40:43.566 --> 40:45.502
I'd love to, honey, but I got to
get up so early with her.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.813
I just thought maybe
you'd want to go.

40:47.987 --> 40:48.945
Well, I would, but..

40:48.947 --> 40:51.781
It doesn't matter. I have to be
there. I'll be late. Goodbye.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.150
- Bye-bye. Call me, huh?
- Yep.

41:00.083 --> 41:01.199
Hi.

41:22.522 --> 41:24.309
Well, I see you got that dame

41:24.482 --> 41:25.939
from <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> to show up.

41:26.109 --> 41:28.897
Mm-hmm. I thought maybe
I could get her to...

41:29.153 --> 41:31.065
Hi, Joe.
Hi, Mr. Ballefoy.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.925
Hi, honey, I thought
we could get them to use

41:32.949 --> 41:35.066
Covington Farms as a background
for a fashion layout.

41:35.243 --> 41:37.485
You know, that country living
we were talking about and..

41:37.787 --> 41:40.655
Tell them we'll furnish anything
they need. Co-operate fully.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.040
Get in there
as solid as you can, Joe.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.020
If we get as much as a mention
of Covington Farms

41:45.044 --> 41:45.918
in the whole layout

41:45.920 --> 41:47.411
I know, I know.
It'll be an accident.

41:47.588 --> 41:49.024
Still, I might as well
confess to you.

41:49.048 --> 41:52.086
I had an ulterior motive
for making the suggestion.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.421
Frankly...

42:01.310 --> 42:02.391
Where was I?

42:02.520 --> 42:03.520
Frankly.

42:03.604 --> 42:04.936
Oh, yes, frankly.

42:05.106 --> 42:07.849
You know how Mr. Covington
loves personal publicity.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.143
Oh, no, come on, not again.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.606
There's one thing that
Covington has got to face.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.942
A man does not automatically
become a public figure

42:15.116 --> 42:17.356
because he happens to build
an empire out of chicken fat!

42:17.493 --> 42:18.493
Joe...

42:18.494 --> 42:21.328
I got this guy
into the <i>Poultry Annual</i>

42:21.497 --> 42:22.738
with a full head close-up

42:22.915 --> 42:24.907
and I got him
into the <i>Dairyland News.</i>

42:25.084 --> 42:27.997
Now, there they care, I even
finagled a feature story

42:28.171 --> 42:30.584
on this man in
<i>Western Feed And Grain</i>

42:30.757 --> 42:32.168
but <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> ?
Now come on!

42:32.341 --> 42:33.673
Are you through?

42:34.385 --> 42:36.297
It's Mrs. Covington.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.386
That old hayraker?

42:38.556 --> 42:41.299
- Our leader is rich, Joe.
- His wife is a rich hayraker.

42:41.476 --> 42:45.015
And she wants her home
and garden and her picassos...

42:45.188 --> 42:46.665
I suppose I should get her
elected best-dressed cow

42:46.689 --> 42:47.689
while I'm at it, huh?

42:47.732 --> 42:49.815
- In full color.
- Uh-huh.

42:59.827 --> 43:00.827
- Joe?
- Huh?

43:00.995 --> 43:03.157
Why aren't you dancing with me?

43:03.331 --> 43:05.197
Honey, I am dancing with you.

43:05.374 --> 43:07.957
Hey, uh, doll,
hit me again, huh?

You'll wake her up.

45:40.613 --> 45:42.049
What's she doing up
at this time of night?

45:42.073 --> 45:42.947
She was hungry.

45:42.949 --> 45:44.301
Well, she's got to
learn sooner or later

45:44.325 --> 45:45.861
some of mommy's
time belongs to daddy.

45:46.035 --> 45:47.992
I think it's daddy's
time of night. Wow!

45:48.829 --> 45:50.365
Whoa, whoa!

45:50.539 --> 45:51.975
Honey, just try to
keep your voice down.

45:51.999 --> 45:53.602
What's the matter?
It's two o'clock in the morning.

45:53.626 --> 45:55.103
And I've been working
since 10.00 a.m.

45:55.127 --> 45:56.772
I come home and I get shushed?
What is that?

45:56.796 --> 45:58.232
You've been working
your elbow more than

45:58.256 --> 45:59.130
anything else, haven't you?

45:59.131 --> 46:00.542
I gotta drink
with these people.

46:00.716 --> 46:02.673
I told you that's
part of the job.

46:02.843 --> 46:05.280
I thought your job was to advise
them. See they have confidence.

46:05.304 --> 46:06.824
If Ballefoy wants me
to drink with him,

46:06.931 --> 46:08.011
what am I gonna
do about it?

46:08.099 --> 46:09.243
Well, if he has
confidence in you...

46:09.267 --> 46:12.101
- Confidence?
- Shh! Please.

46:13.104 --> 46:16.097
He has confidence that I'll do
what I'm told regardless.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.640
"Confidence."

46:17.775 --> 46:21.064
He even has confidence,
I think, that to keep my job

46:21.737 --> 46:23.569
I'd ask the mayor
of San Francisco

46:23.739 --> 46:26.106
to give a ticker tape parade
for his chicken-fat king.

46:30.204 --> 46:31.570
What happened with..

46:40.798 --> 46:42.005
Well, now, look..

46:42.633 --> 46:43.633
Um..

46:45.636 --> 46:48.174
I come home after
a couple of drinks

46:48.347 --> 46:49.929
and you're cold sober.

46:50.099 --> 46:51.326
Well, maybe you're
a little tired.

46:51.350 --> 46:53.307
So, I know I seem
loud and ob...

46:53.477 --> 46:54.763
All right, I am.

46:58.566 --> 46:59.977
You didn't used to think so.

47:00.901 --> 47:02.893
I feel your disapproval.
I feel it.

47:05.406 --> 47:06.550
Now, look, if you
want to sit up

47:06.574 --> 47:08.190
if you wanna...
wait for me

47:08.367 --> 47:10.095
well, is there any law
that says you can't have

47:10.119 --> 47:11.555
a couple of blasts
while you're waiting?

47:11.579 --> 47:12.820
Huh, is there?

47:14.165 --> 47:16.101
So that maybe we can have
some laughs around here?

47:16.125 --> 47:17.366
Is there, huh?

47:17.543 --> 47:18.979
Joe, I'm not supposed to,
on account of my milk.

47:19.003 --> 47:20.803
I know, your milk.
Yeah, what day is that bit?

47:20.921 --> 47:23.202
Anyhow, it's the 20th century.
They invented milk bottles.

47:23.341 --> 47:26.209
They got, they got milk in cans.
It's as good as that milk.

47:26.385 --> 47:27.967
You're gonna
ruin your shape.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.968
Uh, see, it's just,
I, for crying out loud

47:36.145 --> 47:37.998
you think you're the only
woman that ever had a baby.

47:38.022 --> 47:40.167
There, well, I was dragged
around by the scruff of my neck

47:40.191 --> 47:42.934
on midnight trains
and in freezing weather.

47:43.110 --> 47:45.853
And I was, I was eating
crackers and peanut...

47:46.030 --> 47:48.272
Don't do that,
I was eating peanut butter!

47:49.200 --> 47:51.192
Now kids have got to
learn to be people? Don't...

47:51.369 --> 47:53.952
Look, please, just get her
a bottle and some formula.

47:54.121 --> 47:56.283
Because I wanna have a ball,
just you and me.

47:56.457 --> 47:58.619
- Shh, please.
- Look, all right, don't shush me!

47:58.793 --> 48:01.001
And if I'm too loud, then
I'll just close the damn door.

48:01.170 --> 48:02.877
No, Joe, please,
it's too stuffy.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.333
- At that age...
- No!

48:29.448 --> 48:31.440
How could I do
a thing like that?

48:33.202 --> 48:34.488
To a child?

48:37.665 --> 48:39.281
What's the matter with me?

49:29.175 --> 49:30.175
You're right.

49:30.301 --> 49:31.917
It's kind of
stuffy in there.

50:20.476 --> 50:21.557
"Po-Ra", huh?

50:21.977 --> 50:23.559
You'll make it yet.

50:26.899 --> 50:28.731
<i>Tilsammen I himmelen.</i>

50:36.200 --> 50:37.200
I'm sorry.

50:37.368 --> 50:39.075
I'm sorry.

50:39.245 --> 50:40.577
I'm sorry.

50:41.580 --> 50:44.573
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

50:48.420 --> 50:49.831
Mr. Clay's office.

50:50.506 --> 50:52.088
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
He...

50:52.883 --> 50:54.499
Yes, I know it's important.

50:55.761 --> 50:58.003
I'll give him the message
as soon as he gets in.

50:58.681 --> 51:01.048
Oh, well, I, I'm sure
he'll be here any minute.

51:01.934 --> 51:02.970
Yes, I will.

51:09.984 --> 51:12.317
- Coffee.
- Oh, Mr. Clay,

51:12.486 --> 51:14.686
- Coffee, Nell, coffee!
- Mr. Ballefoy says please call.

51:14.738 --> 51:16.070
- Yeah, okay, okay.
- It's...

51:16.240 --> 51:17.520
- Coffee, coffee.
- It's heating.

51:17.616 --> 51:19.177
I just wanna be sure
about the Ballefoy thing.

51:19.201 --> 51:21.067
- Now, he said...
- Okay, okay, okay.

51:21.245 --> 51:22.952
You did your duty.
You told me.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.662
Just get the coffee.

51:24.915 --> 51:26.247
It isn't hot.

51:26.667 --> 51:28.033
Did I say hot coffee?

51:28.210 --> 51:29.210
I just said coffee.

51:29.378 --> 51:30.960
Look, just bring it.

52:15.799 --> 52:17.256
You got a sec, Joe?

52:17.426 --> 52:19.042
For you, all day, Rad.

52:21.347 --> 52:23.134
Oh, the head.

52:24.016 --> 52:25.427
It was Debbie's
first birthday

52:25.601 --> 52:28.435
and Kirsten and I, uh,
celebrated last night.

52:28.604 --> 52:29.811
Really hung one on?

52:29.980 --> 52:31.187
Yeah, a capital hung.

52:31.357 --> 52:32.751
Well, if you'd rather
not talk just now...

52:32.775 --> 52:35.188
Oh, no, no!
Business as usual.

52:35.361 --> 52:36.897
- Hey, want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

52:37.071 --> 52:38.983
Oh, well,
what-what's on your mind?

52:40.491 --> 52:42.107
I'd like to, uh,
chat with you

52:42.284 --> 52:44.321
about the Covington
Farms account.

52:44.495 --> 52:45.906
Oh, shoot.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.287
Well, it's a long story

52:47.456 --> 52:49.197
but the point is
I think it would be best

52:49.375 --> 52:50.957
if we took you
off the account.

52:52.503 --> 52:53.744
You took..

52:53.921 --> 52:54.921
What?

52:55.673 --> 52:58.416
What is, uh..
Ballefoy and I get along.

52:58.926 --> 53:02.294
Well, the truth is
they're letting Ballefoy out.

53:02.471 --> 53:03.757
Frankly, for..

53:03.931 --> 53:05.467
...drinking too much.

53:05.891 --> 53:06.891
And the new man...

53:06.892 --> 53:08.804
Well, I can adjust
to a new man.

53:09.103 --> 53:10.264
Well, actually, Joe,

53:10.437 --> 53:12.770
we sort of had other
plans for you, anyhow.

53:12.940 --> 53:14.125
We were talking
of putting you on

53:14.149 --> 53:15.560
the Campbell Cherokee
Tool account.

53:15.734 --> 53:17.566
- I'm sure you...
- Campbell Cherokee Tool..

53:17.736 --> 53:19.352
I'd be in Houston
half the time.

53:19.530 --> 53:22.273
- Houston's a refreshing town.
- I've got a wife and a kid!

53:22.449 --> 53:24.987
- Well, Joe, we feel...
- It's a demotion, isn't it?

53:25.160 --> 53:27.527
- I wouldn't call it that.
- You wouldn't?

53:27.705 --> 53:29.287
Smaller, less sensitive account

53:29.456 --> 53:30.697
a million miles
away from home.

53:30.874 --> 53:32.102
Now, what would
you call it, Rad?

53:32.126 --> 53:33.269
- Well, uh...
- Well, never mind.

53:33.293 --> 53:34.625
I think I understand.

53:40.426 --> 53:42.167
I hope you do, Joe.

53:47.057 --> 53:48.673
Don't feel bad, honey.

53:50.144 --> 53:52.636
I wouldn't be surprised if...
if Rad Leland

53:52.813 --> 53:55.601
wanted you out of town
for fear you'd get his job.

53:57.609 --> 53:59.145
Not his decision.

53:59.653 --> 54:01.815
Well, somebody's
making the decisions.

54:01.989 --> 54:03.525
It's politics down there.

54:04.491 --> 54:06.553
You want the rest of this?
I'll get some more, honey.

54:06.577 --> 54:07.909
Mm-hmm.

54:12.583 --> 54:16.327
I don't know. I've... tried
to be honest with myself.

54:17.087 --> 54:19.295
I asked myself
if it was my fault.

54:19.965 --> 54:21.752
You know it's not.

54:22.217 --> 54:24.755
Well, that's funny.
There's two bottles down there.

54:25.304 --> 54:26.670
I thought I had three.

54:28.599 --> 54:29.599
Funny.

54:43.489 --> 54:45.651
You do your job, honey.

54:45.824 --> 54:47.941
Yeah, I do.
I know I do.

54:49.703 --> 54:51.945
The main point
is you do your job.

54:53.999 --> 54:57.117
Yeah, I swore I had
three bottles in there.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.084
You do your job fine.

55:04.843 --> 55:06.459
You know,
you've gotta remember

55:06.637 --> 55:07.969
not everybody's honest.

55:08.138 --> 55:09.754
Things are going
on down there.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.143
Bums.

55:33.872 --> 55:34.872
Howdy, Landry.

55:34.915 --> 55:36.577
Charlie, shake hands
with Joe Clay.

55:36.750 --> 55:39.493
Joe is the new PR man
from DDJA. Charlie Dean.

55:39.670 --> 55:41.030
- Good to see you, Joe.
- Pleasure.

55:41.171 --> 55:42.565
Charlie's one of
our vice-presidents.

55:42.589 --> 55:44.330
Oh, I look forward
to working with you.

55:44.508 --> 55:45.944
Say, Joe, you know
we're having a little

55:45.968 --> 55:47.254
barbecue out at
my place Sunday.

55:47.427 --> 55:48.963
Why don't you come
on out and join us?

55:49.137 --> 55:51.217
I guarantee, you'll get all
the barbecue you can eat.

55:51.306 --> 55:53.514
Yeah, and all the bourbon
you can drink, too.

55:53.684 --> 55:54.765
Thank you.

55:55.811 --> 55:57.052
How's she doing, Landry?

55:57.229 --> 55:58.936
Oh, she's doing great.

55:59.231 --> 56:00.511
<i>Mama Bear..</i>

56:01.191 --> 56:04.480
<i>...and Baby Bear.</i>

56:04.653 --> 56:06.770
<i>Duh! Oh, goody-goody.</i>

56:06.947 --> 56:08.404
<i>Toast and honey.</i>

56:37.853 --> 56:39.060
Mommy?

56:40.647 --> 56:41.888
Mommy?

56:43.567 --> 56:44.774
Mommy?

56:46.111 --> 56:47.318
Mommy?

56:47.487 --> 56:48.898
What's wrong, honey? Huh?

56:49.072 --> 56:50.438
Oh, it's too noisy, huh?

56:50.616 --> 56:52.278
You just lie down here.

56:52.451 --> 56:54.095
It's all those people
coming home from work.

56:54.119 --> 56:55.639
You go to sleep.
I'll close the window.

56:55.746 --> 56:57.908
<i>Some more honey.
What else?</i>

56:58.081 --> 57:00.994
<i>But, Henry, I..
They're...</i>

57:01.168 --> 57:03.581
<i>- Shut up!
- But, Henry...</i>

57:03.754 --> 57:04.794
Come on, snuggle bug, huh?

57:04.922 --> 57:05.922
Snuggle down, huh?

57:06.089 --> 57:07.955
Sleep. Sleep.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.752
Are they all right, Pop?

57:50.926 --> 57:52.007
You're sure?

57:54.513 --> 57:55.594
Well, I..

57:55.764 --> 57:57.096
I knew she was having

57:57.265 --> 58:00.099
a couple now and then,
but nothing like this.

58:01.478 --> 58:02.969
Huh? Yeah.

58:03.897 --> 58:04.897
Okay, Pop.

58:05.023 --> 58:07.265
But... you know..

58:07.734 --> 58:09.020
Take good care of them, Pop.

58:09.194 --> 58:11.937
Uh, you tell, tell them I'll
get there as quick as I can.

58:29.965 --> 58:31.081
Waiter?

58:31.967 --> 58:33.378
Waiter?

58:33.510 --> 58:35.092
Could you hit me
again, please?

58:58.785 --> 59:00.117
I, uh..

59:01.121 --> 59:03.488
I've got to get the 11..

59:03.665 --> 59:06.203
I've got go home
on the 11:30 plane.

59:06.376 --> 59:07.662
My, uh..

59:07.836 --> 59:09.998
Uh... my wife..

59:10.547 --> 59:13.005
...got drunk and set
the apartment on fire.

59:36.948 --> 59:38.860
Couldn't this...
be rebuilt?

59:40.994 --> 59:42.530
Frame's burned through.

59:44.623 --> 59:46.517
Well, if you didn't spend
most of your time in Houston

59:46.541 --> 59:47.907
it wouldn't have happened.

59:49.086 --> 59:50.327
Well, don't worry.

59:51.630 --> 59:52.899
I won't be going
to Houston anymore.

59:52.923 --> 59:54.130
They fired me.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.303
Uh, Debbie, uh..

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.707
You run outside
and play for a while.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.438
I want to speak
to your mother.

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:54.724
Come on, honey.

01:00:57.362 --> 01:00:58.478
What's the matter, honey?

01:00:58.655 --> 01:00:59.924
Honey, we've got
to talk about something.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:01.308
- Something serious.
- Have a beer.

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:03.111
No! I'm sorry.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:05.605
- What's the matter, you drunk?
- Oh, I haven't had a drop.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.142
Well, then what's
the matter with you?

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:11.248
I walked by the Union Square
bar. I was gonna go in.

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:14.502
And I saw myself,
my reflection, in the window.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:17.459
And I thought,
"I wonder who that bum is."

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:19.043
And then I saw it was me.

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:20.820
- Now, look at me. I'm a bum.
- No...

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.756
Look at me. Look at you!
You're a bum!

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.511
Look at you
and look at us.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:25.922
Look at us.
Come on.

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:27.802
Look at us.
See?

01:01:27.976 --> 01:01:29.467
- A couple of bums.
- Hurts.

01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:31.289
Now look, listen to me.
You've got to listen to me.

01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:33.207
It came to me all of a sudden.
I saw the whole thing.

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:35.598
You know why I've been fired
from five jobs in four years?

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:37.378
And it's not politics,
like we always say.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:39.143
It's not office
politics or... jealousy

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:41.233
or any of that stuff.
It's booze!

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:44.194
- It's booze!
- Ah! A couple of drinks...

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.262
We have more than a couple
of drinks! We get drunk.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:48.152
Then we stay drunk
most of the time.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.409
Look at the...
dump that we live in.

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.415
And the... clothes
that we wear.

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:55.668
We send that child
off to school like she's..

01:01:56.338 --> 01:01:57.954
Look at that, I,
uh, I, I'm a drunk

01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:59.997
and I don't do my job
and that's it!

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:01.757
I'm a drunk and
I don't do my job

01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:03.919
and I got fired and
I can't get a job now

01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:05.381
and I..

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.076
We should've done
this a long time ago.

01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:09.744
Taken a look at ourselves
and realize we just turned

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.134
into a couple of bums!

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:14.228
- Honey, honey, I love you.
- What? I love you, too.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:15.833
And I don't mean that
I didn't, but we've got to

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:18.895
face this, huh?
Please?

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:21.694
All right. We, we just
won't drink so much.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:23.195
No, not so much..

01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:25.009
Look, I've got a plan and
we've got to do it, honey.

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:26.319
We've got to make it work.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:28.179
We're gonna get sober,
but we're gonna stay sober.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:30.365
We don't take a drop!
Nothing!

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:31.933
And then, I thought
this out all the way home.

01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:33.517
We're gonna go to your
father and we're gonna

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.658
convince him that we mean it,
and, and he'll give us

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.292
enough money to
get off the ground.

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.262
And, and then I'll go
around to the old place.

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:42.165
They'll see that I'm sober,
and they'll take me back.

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:44.654
Are you with me?
Because we've gotta do it.

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:45.988
If we don't do it now,
it's gonna be too late.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:48.174
We're gonna make it work.
Are you with me?

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:50.308
- I'm always with you.
- We've gotta do it, honey.

01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:51.849
We've got to make it work.

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:06.272
Hey, Pop.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.281
Are you sure that
Vic Tanny started this way?

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:09.451
Who?

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:11.785
Bernarr Macfadden.

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.242
- One more, Joe.
- Yeah, yeah, one more, Joe.

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:15.952
Anything you say, warden.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.617
Hey, warden..

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.456
...gotta ask you
one question.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.586
Are you..

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:23.213
You sure that..

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:25.841
...out there,
there is a highway

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:27.919
and down that highway..

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:30.596
...there is a town,
a town with people

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:32.757
with people
just like us?

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:35.551
- One more tree, Joe.
- One more tree, Joe. I know.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:40.852
Oh!

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:42.733
One more tree, Joe.
One more tree, Joe.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:45.736
Oh!

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:47.195
Are you in for life?

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:48.901
It's beginning
to look like it.

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:50.928
- How long have you been here?
- Almost a month.

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:53.114
Uh-huh. Oh, I feel like
I've been here ten years.

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:55.120
- Oh, yeah.
- It seems to agree with you.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:56.999
Do you like boys?

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.745
- I love 'em.
- Yeah?

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:02.620
Come with me.
There's something I wanna try.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:11.463
Yeah-ah!

01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:15.976
Oh!

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.331
All my life I've
wanted to do that.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.096
- Oh, poor little city boy.
- Yeah.

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.311
- Hey, you know something?
- Huh?

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.271
I never really understood..

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.855
...the reason for
haystacks before.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:30.384
It's that crazy
smell that gives us

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:31.899
all those problems
we hear about.

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:33.989
- And the softness.
- Yeah.

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:37.954
You know, I, uh..

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:40.124
...can't remember us ever
feeling like this before.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.785
Mm-mm. Except after
a couple of drinks.

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:44.203
Yeah.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:46.042
Was the other better?

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:47.633
Huh?

01:04:48.176 --> 01:04:49.883
Can't see how it would be.

01:05:00.772 --> 01:05:02.058
Yeah, uh-huh!
Uh-huh.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:03.689
Caught you drinking, huh?

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:06.729
No harm in
one beer, Joe.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:07.939
Or two or three.

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:10.355
A matter of how much,
huh, pop?

01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:11.568
Oh!

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.198
Saunders says
he'll pay you Monday.

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:15.109
With Saunders
it's always Monday.

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:16.777
- And then Friday.
- Yeah.

01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:19.823
Hey, do you
remember Mrs. Michelle

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:21.991
where you delivered those
roses about a month ago?

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:23.784
Oh, yeah.
Two months ago, exactly.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.037
My second day
as a trustee.

01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:28.501
She phoned in a big
order this afternoon.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.757
Said she remembered us
because of the nice man

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.168
who delivered the roses.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:33.865
It's all part of
public relations, pop.

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:35.254
Uh, Kirsten upstairs?

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:37.850
Joe.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.301
You want a beer?

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:44.350
You're starting
to trust me again.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.692
Well, thanks... anyway, pop.

01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:59.115
Hi, ho!

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.327
Ooh, what a tasty
little neck.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.403
I'm glad you like it.
Have some more.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.127
No, not right now.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.486
My, we have been good the last
couple of months, haven't we?

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:14.297
- It's perfect, huh?
- Yeah, we sure have.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.713
Much too good because
you are much too beautiful

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:19.928
to be so good
and I was thinking..

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.893
...being good is better
than being bad, yes?

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:26.055
But being too good, jeez,
is worse than death, huh?

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:27.585
Yeah, well, there are
times when I agree with you.

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:29.692
Yeah, well...
how would you like

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:32.023
to spice up
your exemplary life

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:34.154
by just slipping..

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.690
...a teeny-weeny bit?

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:37.219
- A teeny-weeny bit?
- Teeny-weeny, yes.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.735
Just a modicum,
just a minim..

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:42.079
...a drop.

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:44.115
- Where is it?
- Da-da-da, no!

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:45.532
It all starts
with a striptease.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:51.379
Oh, well, I thought
you were talking

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.506
about something more...
tangible.

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:55.316
Please, you're
interrupting a performance.

01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:10.858
Tada!

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.188
- Joe!
- Shh!

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:16.563
- Tada!
- Oh, you're a genius.

01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:19.199
Shh!
Nothing at all, my dear.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:20.701
Of course,
getting this tape off

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.862
is gonna be a...
major operation.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.371
- Ow!
- Okay, now here we go.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:25.952
Fast, all right?

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:27.453
Aah!

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.670
Oh!

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:33.330
Next time I do this,

01:07:34.008 --> 01:07:35.008
I'm gonna shave my legs.

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:40.762
No, Joe, we-we-we can't.

01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:42.652
- What do you mean?
- We'll ruin everything.

01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:44.884
- I mean, we can't do it.
- Just a goldarn minute, lady.

01:07:44.936 --> 01:07:47.349
I'm not...
suggesting an orgy.

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:49.479
I think we've...
learned better than that.

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:50.685
I hope and trust.

01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:53.225
We've... been
working hard, huh?

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:54.610
Behaving ourselves?

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:56.771
Just a wee, little
drop in the privacy

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:59.281
of our own little room.
It ain't going to hurt us.

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:00.907
Who's to know?

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.569
We just lie back in bed
like civilized people.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:04.953
We'll sip it
through a straw.

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:07.410
May I expect your
cooperation... huh?

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:09.951
Well, now, how could
I not vote for someone

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:11.369
who dances so divinely?

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:12.662
Tada!

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.046
And, oh!

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:15.215
Hold on.

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:19.714
- Oh!
- Huh? Twinsies.

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:21.719
And there is another..

01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:23.801
...in the greenhouse.

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:26.136
It is in the fourth pot..

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:28.051
...on the fifth table.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:29.229
Wait a minute.

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:31.346
Fourth pot, third table,
fifth row.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:32.765
Yeah, that's it.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.301
Fourth pot, third table,
fifth row.

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:35.643
Four, five, three.

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.144
Now, you remember
the combination,

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:38.938
because if I die
before I wake,

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:40.401
that's your legacy.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:47.113
- Ahh!
- Oh!

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.622
You are depraved.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.497
Yeah, flattery
will get you everywhere.

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:52.872
Magic time.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:15.770
Oh! Shh!

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:19.109
Here.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:23.234
- Step on it.
- What?

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:25.654
Wha-at?

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.991
Oh, gee.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.622
- Wait a minute.
- Give me that one over there.

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:32.792
Here.

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:35.122
Whoo!

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:41.966
Oh!

01:10:03.074 --> 01:10:04.235
Kirstie?

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:07.119
Kirstie?

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.290
Must have had a nightmare.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:17.462
You all right?

01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:22.090
I'm fine, Daddy.
Just go back to bed.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.145
Come up now.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.065
We're fighting.

01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:51.036
Oh, oh!

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:57.910
Oops!

01:10:58.629 --> 01:11:00.211
It's all gone.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:03.711
Oh, it's all gone.

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:05.251
4-3-5.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:06.714
I'll get the other one.

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:09.756
- Get the other one.
- Shh, shh, shh!

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.639
You'll wake up Daddy.

01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:13.766
- He'll hear you.
- What?

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:20.478
What?

01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:23.189
I'm gonna go
out the window.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:28.733
And down the tree
as silent as a squirrel.

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:30.572
- Down the tree.
- Careful, but hurry up.

01:11:30.745 --> 01:11:32.327
I said it was four,
three, five.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.658
No, now,
wait a second, Joe.

01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:36.368
- What?
- You said...

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.534
Shh! Got to be
quiet as a squirrel.

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:40.293
Three, five, four.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.625
- Nev...
- Oh, yes.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:43.880
It was four, three, five.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.050
Hold that.

01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:48.172
Whoa!

01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:04.560
Hurry back!

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.021
Four, five, three.

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:03.914
Here we go!

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.791
What was it?

01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:08.047
Fourth?
Let me see.

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.217
One..

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.001
...two..

01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:13.170
...three.
Fourth row.

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:14.588
Third table.

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:16.006
Two...

01:13:16.183 --> 01:13:17.515
...fifth pot.

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:19.802
One, two, three, four, five.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:21.095
And come to papa.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:43.913
What happened?

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:49.581
Ha. I got the right,
wrong combina..

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:52.376
Five, four, three.

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:55.045
Five, four.
Fifth row.

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:57.339
Third table,
fourth pot.

01:13:57.516 --> 01:13:59.382
One, two, three.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:05.893
Wait a minute.
What?

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:12.822
Well..

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:15.861
Wait a minute.

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:17.530
What did he say?

01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:20.515
Start it all over.
Wait a minute.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:21.655
One..

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:24.995
One..

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:26.660
Five, four, three.

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:28.328
Well.

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:29.917
It's the fifth pot.

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:31.127
Wait a minute.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.007
Third. Wait.
One, two, three.

01:14:41.519 --> 01:14:42.726
Where is it?

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.353
What? What?

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:54.150
Who's stolen it?
Why? Why?

01:14:57.618 --> 01:14:59.234
Why? Why?

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:02.579
Flowers..

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.239
Where is it?

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:06.078
Red flower!

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:07.868
It's a red flower!

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:10.962
Light.

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:12.589
Turn on the light.

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:23.184
Rain!

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:27.346
Who took it?

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:29.601
Who took it?

01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:31.687
Who took it?

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.568
Who took it? Where?

01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:36.230
Where? Where is it?

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:37.901
Who took it?

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.283
Who took it?

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:42.661
Somebody stole it!

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.162
Aah!

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:45.822
They stole it!

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.616
Aah!

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:58.672
They took it!

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.421
Took it!

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:02.339
They took it!

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:57.228
Daddy?

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:00.530
Daddy?

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:02.483
I'm drunk as a skunk.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:03.776
Kirsten!

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:06.532
I'm plastered
and I'm lonely.

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:07.933
I want you to
kiss me goodnight.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:09.164
Ah!
Dirty Joe brought whiskey.

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:10.653
Come on,
kiss me goodnight, Daddy.

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:12.245
You get back
to your room.

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:19.378
Granddaddy?

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:21.589
- It's Debbie.
- Go to bed, Debbie.

01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:22.762
You get out of here.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:23.969
Get out of here!

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:27.136
- Just leave my Daddy alone.
- Debbie, Debbie!

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:30.222
You come along
with me now.

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:32.061
A little kiss
or something?

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:39.735
- Get in the tub.
- What? No, I don't want to.

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.238
- Get in the tub.
- Daddy.

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:43.941
Get in there!

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:46.151
What are you doing?

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:04.385
168 in.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:51.766
Don't, don't do..

01:18:57.191 --> 01:18:58.978
Aah!
Ed, give me a hand!

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:23.684
How are you
feeling, fella?

01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:26.529
Rotten.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:33.034
Who..
Who are you?

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:35.119
I'm Jim Hungerford.

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:37.239
Nurse says you want help.

01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:43.419
I'm from
Alcoholics Anonymous.

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:48.879
- Honey, please read the book.
- No.

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:51.795
This fella, Hungerford, says
the AA meetings are terrific.

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:53.463
They're just a bunch
of alcoholics

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.006
trying to keep
each other sober.

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:56.494
And it works.
Now, please read the book.

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:57.975
- It make sense
- No!

01:20:59.146 --> 01:21:00.582
I don't even know why you
let them give it to you.

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:02.486
They must... think you're
a... bum or something.

01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:03.935
I asked for it.

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:06.943
I must have needed help.
I was in the hospital.

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:08.272
Well, you didn't
belong there.

01:21:08.405 --> 01:21:10.112
I was there.
Nobody belongs there.

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:12.042
I passed out in the middle
of Mission Street.

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:14.109
I didn't belong
there maybe but..

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:15.680
All right!
You had too much to drink.

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.195
It doesn't mean
you're an alcoholic.

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:19.654
Oh, look, dear, what's wrong
with just going to a meeting?

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.662
Now, what could
we lose, huh?

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:23.480
You can go if you want to.
I don't care.

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:25.120
But, I'm,
I'm not gonna go.

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:28.165
I am not an alcoholic
and I refuse to say I am.

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:31.922
I refuse to-to ask
for help in something

01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:35.885
that is, is just a matter of, of
self-respect and willpower.

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:37.911
I refuse to get up in
front of a bunch of people

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:39.597
and degrade myself.

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:42.975
I know I can't drink because
it gets the best of me.

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:44.434
So, I-I..

01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:46.815
I will just use my
willpower and not drink

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:48.851
and, and that's
the end of it.

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:07.788
Uh, we got time
for a cigarette, huh?

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.206
You nervous?

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:10.383
No, I..

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:12.508
Button came off my jacket.

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:14.590
- Well, leave it open.
- Yeah.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:15.924
Oh, yeah.
Here.

01:22:18.559 --> 01:22:21.176
I used to be
a pretty... fancy dresser.

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:23.720
I wouldn't have been caught
dead with a button off then.

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:26.393
You're scared, huh?

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:28.479
No, this is
natural complexion..

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:29.733
...pale green.

01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:31.436
Nobody will notice.
Come on.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.320
Well, wait a minute.
We, uh..

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:34.856
Just, you know.

01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:37.095
Hey, you know, you are
turning pale green.

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:38.326
Now, will you come on?

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.867
It's facing all the people.

01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:44.700
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean?

01:22:44.877 --> 01:22:46.229
Well, it's facing yourself,
isn't it?

01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:48.040
Look, I don't mind
talking about my life,

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:49.524
even the most
embarrassing parts of it.

01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:51.289
That's not what bothers me.

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:54.366
It's... the idea
of standing up there

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:55.488
in front of all
of those people

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:57.549
and saying
"I am an alcoholic."

01:22:57.723 --> 01:22:58.723
Are you?

01:22:58.765 --> 01:23:00.347
- Yes, I...
- So are we.

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:02.745
Now, you've heard us night
after night after night say it

01:23:02.769 --> 01:23:05.102
"I am an alcoholic."
It's a big step forward.

01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:06.638
I know, but it's
funny, isn't it?

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:08.351
That four months ago
you came to see me

01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:10.312
in the violent ward
and you told me about AA.

01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:12.694
Now, I went to the meetings
and I started listening

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:15.105
and I've been sober
ever since.

01:23:15.282 --> 01:23:16.523
Kirstie has been
sober too

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:17.865
just as sober as I am.

01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:20.778
And she has never said,
"I am an alcoholic."

01:23:20.954 --> 01:23:23.162
She even hasn't
been near a meeting.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.449
She claims she can do
it on willpower alone.

01:23:25.792 --> 01:23:26.999
Can you?

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:31.837
My name is Jim Hungerford.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.127
And I'm an alcoholic.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.217
I'm your chairman
for tonight.

01:23:36.637 --> 01:23:38.173
Now, all I have to do
to qualify myself

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:41.181
is to say that
I drank too much too often

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.182
over too long
a period of time.

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:45.221
Welcome to the
regular weekly meeting

01:23:45.395 --> 01:23:47.933
of the Mason Street Group
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:54.569
"Alcoholics Anonymous is
a fellowship of men and women

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:56.195
"who share their experience

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:58.152
"strength and hope
with each other.

01:23:58.325 --> 01:23:59.925
"That they may solve
their common problem

01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:02.239
"and help others to
recover from alcoholism.

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:04.078
"The only requirement
for membership

01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:06.365
"is a desire to stop drinking.

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:09.330
"There are no dues or
fees for AA membership.

01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:11.665
"We are self-supporting
through our own contributions.

01:24:12.256 --> 01:24:14.999
"AA is not allied
with any sect, denomination

01:24:15.175 --> 01:24:17.508
"politics, organization
or institution.

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:20.136
"It does not wish to
engage in any controversy

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:23.048
"neither endorses
nor opposes any causes.

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:25.638
"Our primary purpose
is to stay sober

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:28.303
and help other alcoholics
to achieve sobriety."

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.417
Now, we got a couple
of speakers tonight.

01:24:31.441 --> 01:24:33.524
I know you're
gonna enjoy hearing.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.713
To start things off,
we're going to hear from a man

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.603
who came to us
just four months ago.

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:39.741
Now, this will be his
first talk at an AA meeting.

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:41.701
Joe.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:01.512
My name..

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.183
My name is Joe... Clay.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:12.889
I'm an alcoholic.

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:33.577
Honey?

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:37.751
Debbie?

01:25:52.022 --> 01:25:53.022
Come in.

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:55.064
Oh, hi, Jim.

01:25:55.859 --> 01:25:57.145
I'm sorry to
act like such a...

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:58.630
Oh, don't be silly.
You should have called sooner.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:25:59.770
Any word?

01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:01.354
Two days and two nights

01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:03.193
and I...
I had to call you.

01:26:03.367 --> 01:26:04.447
I was afraid
that I might...

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:05.970
Yeah, I know.
Did you tell the police?

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:07.030
Yeah.

01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:09.237
I-I just..

01:26:09.414 --> 01:26:11.451
I can't see how this
could be happening to us.

01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:13.161
Me too.
Too many drinks?

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:14.896
Well, a hell of lot of
people drink as much as Kirstie

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.957
and I ever did and
they're not alcoholics.

01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:18.130
Yet.

01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:19.709
A lot of 'em never are.

01:26:21.218 --> 01:26:22.504
It's a lottery, Joe.

01:26:23.595 --> 01:26:26.303
- And you lost.
- Yeah, well, how?

01:26:26.473 --> 01:26:28.510
No way to find out
before it's too late, huh?

01:26:30.268 --> 01:26:31.475
- Joe.
- Hmm?

01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:33.765
You remember how you told
us about Kirsten's obsession

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:35.457
with chocolate candy
when you first met?

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:36.399
Yeah.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.794
Well, a very
perceptive psychologist

01:26:37.818 --> 01:26:39.003
might've told you
then that she was

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.627
a potential alcoholic,
but neither of you

01:26:40.737 --> 01:26:42.048
would have believed
him and besides

01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:43.279
he might have been wrong.

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:44.814
Joe, how many
strawberries does it

01:26:44.991 --> 01:26:46.823
take to start an allergy
and which is the one

01:26:46.993 --> 01:26:48.484
that gives you the hives?

01:26:48.662 --> 01:26:50.119
Alcoholism is an illness.

01:26:50.288 --> 01:26:51.599
It's pretty hard to
diagnose an illness

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:52.784
until you've got it.

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:54.623
Come on, Joe.

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:55.954
She'll turn up, honest.

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:57.915
Why did she do it?
Why did she leave?

01:26:58.088 --> 01:27:00.501
- That's...
- She wanted to drink.

01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:03.212
Oh, if she had to drink,
she could drink right here.

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:04.717
And she ought to know it.

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:07.469
You're sober.
It's no fun to drink around you.

01:27:08.098 --> 01:27:09.117
Don't you under... it's worse!

01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:11.178
Your sobriety would be
an accusation to her.

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:14.389
She'd be miserable.
She's lost her playmate.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:15.980
And, Joe..

01:27:17.274 --> 01:27:18.606
...listen, uh..

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:21.897
Don't be too surprised
if she finds another one.

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:30.911
Look, she loves me

01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:32.323
and you just
don't understand.

01:27:32.497 --> 01:27:33.657
There's no trouble
between us.

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:35.201
There wasn't any trouble.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:36.536
Joe, don't forget.

01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:38.542
For a long time,
long, long time

01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:40.954
booze has been an integral
part of your relationship.

01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:42.567
Now, if she keeps on
drinking and you don't,

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:44.360
well, you've got to find
a new meeting ground,

01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:45.875
a different basis
for a relationship.

01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:47.452
That takes a whale
of an adjustment.

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:49.758
Well, I find it
hard to believe this.

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:51.672
There was one thing
about us, we always knew

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:53.286
that we were in love.
Now, we knew that.

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:54.912
And there was no doubt about it.
We just knew it.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:56.289
Now, do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you

01:27:56.313 --> 01:27:57.520
that we,
that we had something?

01:27:57.689 --> 01:27:59.646
Well, things like that
don't just evaporate.

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:03.439
Joe, the night you tore up
your father-in-law's flowers.

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:04.922
- You're looking for the bottle?
- Yes.

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:05.965
What did you do
when you found it?

01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:07.070
What? I drank it.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.360
Oh, you didn't take it back
and drink it with Kirsten?

01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:14.330
No.

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:15.699
There comes a time
in the life

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:17.741
of every alcoholic
when the bottle is God.

01:28:17.918 --> 01:28:19.204
Nobody matters,
nothing matters

01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:20.697
but the next drink.
You know that!

01:28:20.837 --> 01:28:21.918
I know I know it.

01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:23.579
I just, I can't believe

01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:25.840
that this is happening to me.
That's all!

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:28.926
Two people,
seven years.

01:28:29.179 --> 01:28:32.138
Booze, no booze,
drunk, sober.

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:33.468
Isn't love..

01:28:34.017 --> 01:28:35.017
...love?

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.138
I don't know.

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:38.890
I was drunk for 12 years.

01:28:39.064 --> 01:28:40.896
I've been sober the last 14.

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:42.978
All I know is the drunk
world is one world

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.767
and the sober world
is another world.

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:50.444
Such a lonely person.

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:53.867
Oh, God, keep her safe.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:56.572
Is your little girl all right?

01:28:57.415 --> 01:28:58.747
Yeah, she's..

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:01.701
...on the peninsula
with her grandfather.

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.173
Hello?

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:08.166
Yes, this is Mr. Clay.

01:29:08.802 --> 01:29:10.634
Yes, Kirsten Clay.
That's right. Yes.

01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:11.840
- Where?
- Police?

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:13.675
Where is, Shore Motel?

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:14.965
Where is that?

01:29:16.059 --> 01:29:17.300
I see.
Who, who..

01:29:17.477 --> 01:29:19.184
Mr. Turning,
is she all right?

01:29:22.649 --> 01:29:24.140
Is she alone?

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:26.517
I'll be there
as fast as possible.

01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:27.936
Thank you for calling.

01:29:28.446 --> 01:29:29.482
She's in a motel.

01:29:29.656 --> 01:29:31.022
Mr. Turning owns the motel.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.440
He said that she..

01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:35.113
...came in a cab
and checked in drunk.

01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:37.767
- She's been drunk ever since.
- Do you want me to go with you?

01:29:37.914 --> 01:29:39.892
- No, I'd better go alone, Jim.
- Oh, well, here, take my car.

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:42.033
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, Joe, listen, listen.

01:29:42.752 --> 01:29:44.072
At the risk of
sounding preachy...

01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:46.370
No, look, I know now, easy
does it. First thing first...

01:29:46.423 --> 01:29:47.709
No, no,
it's something else.

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:49.569
Now, she may resent you
intruding on her drinking

01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:50.820
and she may resent
your being sober.

01:29:50.844 --> 01:29:52.029
- It separates you...
- I know that.

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:55.137
But, Joe... on the other hand,
if you're not sober

01:29:55.307 --> 01:29:57.765
you're not worth a damn to her
or anybody else, are you?

01:29:58.727 --> 01:29:59.727
No.

01:30:09.112 --> 01:30:10.853
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, I'm Mr. Clay.

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:13.568
Oh, she's in the last bungalow
over there, Mr. Clay.

01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:14.823
Thank you.

01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:39.869
<i>One sliced turnip,</i>

01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:41.475
<i>some stalks of celery,</i>

01:30:41.645 --> 01:30:43.352
<i>add pepper and salt</i>

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:46.138
<i>and a dash
of Worcestershire sauce.</i>

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:47.483
<i>My, my.</i>

01:30:47.651 --> 01:30:49.358
<i>What nobility
has to put up with</i>

01:30:49.527 --> 01:30:51.314
<i>just to have dinner.</i>

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:52.945
<i>I'm glad I'm a rabbit.</i>

01:30:53.323 --> 01:30:54.939
<i>Now, place rabbit
into oven</i>

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:58.280
<i>and heat oven
to 350 degrees.</i>

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:02.489
<i>350 degrees?
Too hot for me.</i>

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:04.511
<i>I just remembered
I have another commitment.</i>

01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:06.450
<i>Please extend my regrets
to His Majesty.</i>

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:08.244
<i>I bid you farewell,</i>
arrivederci,

01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:10.913
sayonara, <i>and
all that sort of jazz.</i>

01:31:11.091 --> 01:31:12.753
<i>Oh, no, you're not.</i>

01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:15.964
<i>You're stayin'.
I insist.</i>

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:18.800
<i>Okay, okay,
if it's that important.</i>

01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:24.303
<i>Cook! Cook!
Where's my hasenpfeffer?</i>

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:29.565
<i>Comin' right up,
Royal Highness.</i>

01:31:29.818 --> 01:31:33.528
Bon appetit,
<i>O gracious Majesty.</i>

01:31:37.993 --> 01:31:40.610
<i>You bonehead.
That..</i>

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:07.428
- Have a drink, honey.
- Not just now.

01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:10.097
- Oh, come on. Have a drink.
- No, I don't want one.

01:32:10.608 --> 01:32:12.019
Oh, I do.

01:32:13.987 --> 01:32:15.273
You think..

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.442
Honey, do you think
you're about ready to come home?

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:25.787
Hmm?

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:30.539
Oh, it's you.

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:33.663
What do you want?

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:35.293
I want my wife.

01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:40.419
Sober Joe..

01:32:41.347 --> 01:32:42.713
Milkman's friend.

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:47.226
Now you got me.
What do you want to..

01:32:47.937 --> 01:32:48.937
...do?

01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:51.814
I was hoping
to take you home.

01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:58.691
I like it here.

01:33:01.534 --> 01:33:03.947
My friends are here.

01:33:06.206 --> 01:33:07.868
You have your friends,
I have mine.

01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:10.834
Have a drink.

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:16.005
Oh.

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:18.590
Excuse me, I forgot.

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:21.836
Shame we're out of, uh..

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:25.590
...milk..

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:29.890
...coffee and tea,
orange juice..

01:33:30.897 --> 01:33:32.559
...non-alcoholic beverages.

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:36.809
Honey, if you'd
just come home..

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.561
No!

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:48.825
You laid in
a good supply.

01:33:48.957 --> 01:33:50.493
- We could take it home.
- No!

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:56.336
You have your friends.
You don't need me.

01:33:56.506 --> 01:33:57.792
Oh, honey..

01:33:59.717 --> 01:34:00.924
Joe..

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:02.759
Kiss me, Joe.

01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:11.848
I taste like gin.

01:34:13.231 --> 01:34:14.231
You never did like gin

01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:16.519
so I didn't
drink it, but..

01:34:17.527 --> 01:34:18.688
Now I'm alone,
so I drank it

01:34:18.862 --> 01:34:20.398
'cause I like gin.

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.732
<i>Tilsammen I himmelen.</i>

01:34:30.748 --> 01:34:34.116
Together in heaven,
like the story.

01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:38.666
Now he doesn't even like..

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:42.044
...the taste of me anymore.

01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:54.640
Honey..

01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:58.144
Let me get you some food.

01:34:58.318 --> 01:34:59.587
- No.
- Or you're going to get sick.

01:34:59.611 --> 01:35:00.977
- You know it.
- I don't care.

01:35:01.487 --> 01:35:04.446
I don't care. Just... go away
and leave me alone.

01:35:04.616 --> 01:35:06.903
I don't care
about anything.

01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:14.118
I'll be back.

01:35:14.334 --> 01:35:15.370
Don't bother.

01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:24.758
Joe.

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:28.841
I'm lonely, Joe.

01:35:34.437 --> 01:35:35.803
Have a drink
with me, please.

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:40.311
- I can't.
- I'm lonely.

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:42.150
I'll stay with you,
but I-I can't.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.484
Don't do me any favors.
Can't have a drink.

01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:47.193
Too good to have
a drink with me.

01:35:48.368 --> 01:35:50.906
What did they do to you
down at that AA place, anyway?

01:35:51.079 --> 01:35:52.195
Aren't you a man anymore?

01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:54.322
Can't you hear a woman
calling you?

01:35:54.499 --> 01:35:56.365
I'm a woman.
Can't you hear me!

01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:59.076
- I hear you.
- What're you gonna do about it?

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.540
I heard you, but we've got
our own little apartment...

01:36:01.714 --> 01:36:03.080
No, we haven't.

01:36:03.466 --> 01:36:04.582
I'm not going
back there.

01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:05.875
Never, never.

01:36:06.552 --> 01:36:07.738
I want to be
where people live.

01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:09.173
I don't want
any of your..

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:12.264
...mealy-mouthed...

01:36:14.018 --> 01:36:17.352
holier-than-thou, do-gooder
boy scouts with their..

01:36:18.314 --> 01:36:20.101
...with their
hot coffee and..

01:36:20.275 --> 01:36:21.857
...and their cold feet.

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:25.130
I don't want anybody who doesn't
have the guts to take a drink.

01:36:25.154 --> 01:36:27.271
Now go away. Go away.

01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:35.074
I want a cigarette.

01:37:21.461 --> 01:37:22.497
Keep the pack.

01:37:25.381 --> 01:37:27.247
You're not
giving me anything.

01:37:27.717 --> 01:37:29.333
Community property.

01:37:30.178 --> 01:37:31.635
So's the gin.
50-50.

01:37:31.929 --> 01:37:32.929
Here.

01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:39.768
I'm not coming back there.

01:37:39.812 --> 01:37:41.269
You're too good.

01:37:42.607 --> 01:37:44.769
And there's no bore
in the world

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:46.274
like a goody-good.

01:38:38.287 --> 01:38:40.199
Have some of mine, honey.

01:41:03.307 --> 01:41:04.798
Hello!

01:41:13.693 --> 01:41:15.229
We're closed, buddy.

01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:19.147
- I said we're closed.
- No, come on, please.

01:41:19.323 --> 01:41:21.315
We close at 11:00.
Go on home.

01:41:21.492 --> 01:41:22.608
Oh, please.

01:41:24.161 --> 01:41:26.448
Now look, you, get out of here
before I call the cops.

01:41:26.622 --> 01:41:27.783
Now beat it.

01:41:27.999 --> 01:41:30.116
No, please. Please.

01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:33.706
Please.

01:42:01.073 --> 01:42:02.154
Oh..

01:42:05.161 --> 01:42:06.402
Oh, please.

01:42:06.579 --> 01:42:08.161
What is it?
What's happening?

01:42:08.331 --> 01:42:10.243
Go on inside.
I'll take care of this.

01:42:10.833 --> 01:42:11.833
Go on!

01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:14.792
So you like booze,
hey, buddy?

01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:20.382
I didn't know
you wanted it that bad.

01:42:20.551 --> 01:42:21.837
Why didn't you ask?

01:42:22.845 --> 01:42:25.007
I'll give you
all the booze you want.

01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:54.533
Why?

01:42:55.378 --> 01:42:56.619
Joe, who am I?

01:42:57.630 --> 01:42:59.212
- Joe..
- What?

01:42:59.382 --> 01:43:00.498
Who am I?

01:43:02.218 --> 01:43:03.299
Who am I?

01:43:05.471 --> 01:43:07.087
Say it.
Come on.

01:43:08.766 --> 01:43:09.927
Jim.

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:13.510
What happened?

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:15.145
What happened?
You took a drink.

01:43:15.564 --> 01:43:16.680
You're drying out now.

01:43:17.191 --> 01:43:18.251
Listen, your first
two days here

01:43:18.275 --> 01:43:19.753
there was a little
green man chasing you

01:43:19.777 --> 01:43:22.144
around the violent ward
with pruning shears.

01:43:23.531 --> 01:43:25.648
No, no, no.
Don't.

01:43:30.162 --> 01:43:32.449
Got to get up.

01:43:33.374 --> 01:43:35.036
I've got to get my wife.

01:43:35.209 --> 01:43:37.576
No, they went to stay
with her dad for a while.

01:43:42.591 --> 01:43:43.672
I..

01:43:45.344 --> 01:43:47.506
I want her with me.

01:43:49.682 --> 01:43:50.718
Joe..

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:56.185
Joe, you've got
to stay sober

01:43:57.106 --> 01:43:58.938
even if it means
keeping away from her.

01:44:02.695 --> 01:44:04.607
Hmm?
I can't hear you, Joe.

01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:08.858
I love her!

01:44:10.244 --> 01:44:11.985
Joe, if you
really love her..

01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:13.699
I mean, if you
really love her..

01:44:13.873 --> 01:44:15.284
...then you help her.

01:44:16.751 --> 01:44:17.751
How?

01:44:17.877 --> 01:44:19.243
You set an example.

01:44:19.378 --> 01:44:21.022
Show her that-that
an alky can beat the rap.

01:44:21.046 --> 01:44:22.878
Give her something
to aim at!

01:44:23.174 --> 01:44:24.756
Come on.
Will you do that?

01:44:25.217 --> 01:44:26.217
Huh?

01:44:30.556 --> 01:44:31.888
Oh, boy.

01:44:32.057 --> 01:44:33.410
I should have never
told you about that guy

01:44:33.434 --> 01:44:34.891
with the pruning shears.

01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:49.982
Hello, pop.

01:44:52.495 --> 01:44:54.782
I told you before, Joe.

01:44:55.623 --> 01:44:56.864
Don't come here.

01:44:58.042 --> 01:44:59.453
I've got something
important, pop.

01:44:59.668 --> 01:45:01.751
Something I have
to talk to you about.

01:45:04.089 --> 01:45:06.126
Really, this means
a lot to me.

01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:14.802
Kirs gone out someplace?

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:16.841
She's gone to
the movies.

01:45:18.354 --> 01:45:19.515
She okay?

01:45:19.939 --> 01:45:21.931
You come here to talk
about Kirstie?

01:45:22.107 --> 01:45:23.143
No, I didn't.

01:45:24.026 --> 01:45:25.983
Tell you what
I came to talk about, pop.

01:45:27.238 --> 01:45:29.275
I've come to square
accounts with you.

01:45:33.202 --> 01:45:34.568
First of all..

01:45:35.079 --> 01:45:38.197
...the $500 that you
lent us that time to..

01:45:38.749 --> 01:45:40.661
...try and get
started again?

01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:44.460
We spent it,
most of it,

01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:46.337
on a couple of benders.

01:45:48.592 --> 01:45:50.529
Really didn't make much effort
to get straightened out.

01:45:50.553 --> 01:45:53.967
I just stayed drunk as long
as the money lasted.

01:45:55.683 --> 01:45:57.595
We lied to you about that.

01:45:58.894 --> 01:46:00.622
And I know you worked hard
for the money, and...

01:46:00.646 --> 01:46:02.228
You started
my daughter drinking.

01:46:02.398 --> 01:46:03.434
Pop, please listen.

01:46:03.691 --> 01:46:06.274
You started
my daughter drinking!

01:46:07.069 --> 01:46:08.505
When she lived here
with her mama and me

01:46:08.529 --> 01:46:10.111
she never drank.

01:46:10.281 --> 01:46:12.648
We never gave her
even one beer.

01:46:12.867 --> 01:46:14.108
You started her!

01:46:14.285 --> 01:46:15.492
Pop, what are you..

01:46:16.161 --> 01:46:18.448
Pop! Don't!

01:46:18.622 --> 01:46:21.160
Are you nuts?
Now, what're you trying to do?

01:46:27.673 --> 01:46:28.789
Pop.

01:46:30.593 --> 01:46:32.209
Sure, we drank together.

01:46:32.803 --> 01:46:34.840
And we did right
from the start, but..

01:46:35.014 --> 01:46:36.255
Where is she?

01:46:37.683 --> 01:46:39.925
She's been gone
three days.

01:46:41.186 --> 01:46:42.427
My girl.

01:46:42.605 --> 01:46:44.267
My girl.

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:45.647
Pop..

01:46:47.610 --> 01:46:49.693
She went off
with another bum.

01:46:51.113 --> 01:46:53.571
Not the same one,
another one.

01:46:53.741 --> 01:46:55.858
It's always another bum.

01:46:56.869 --> 01:47:00.033
It's always,
"Goodnight, Dad.

01:47:00.664 --> 01:47:02.326
I'll be home early."

01:47:02.833 --> 01:47:04.369
"Goodnight, Kirstie.

01:47:04.793 --> 01:47:07.410
I'll leave the light on
in the kitchen."

01:47:08.964 --> 01:47:12.082
I always turn it off
in the morning, Joe.

01:47:14.303 --> 01:47:16.590
I thought she told me
she was getting better.

01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:19.552
Two weeks ago she was
in the hospital three days

01:47:19.683 --> 01:47:21.640
sick to death
from drinking.

01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:23.927
Can't you tell her
that-that..

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:25.265
Tell her how well
I'm doing.

01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:27.681
Tell her all about
the new apartment.

01:47:27.942 --> 01:47:29.878
Tell her I'll take her back
any time that she wants.

01:47:29.902 --> 01:47:31.268
She wouldn't listen.

01:47:31.487 --> 01:47:32.523
Well, tell her..

01:47:33.656 --> 01:47:35.272
...Debbie cries for her.

01:47:35.449 --> 01:47:37.566
Then she'd get drunk
for sure.

01:47:37.743 --> 01:47:39.075
I don't know what to..

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.032
I don't know what
to tell Debbie.

01:47:44.708 --> 01:47:46.950
Well, pop..

01:47:47.544 --> 01:47:49.344
...there's some things
we can be thankful for.

01:47:49.463 --> 01:47:53.798
Now, I'm working steady
and I'm sober.

01:47:54.593 --> 01:47:56.300
And I'm starting
to pay you back, pop.

01:47:56.512 --> 01:47:58.469
The $500.
There's the first installment.

01:47:58.639 --> 01:48:00.283
And I'm gonna pay
for her hospital bill, too.

01:48:00.307 --> 01:48:01.307
- No.
- Yes, I am.

01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:02.388
And I'm gonna pay you board

01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:03.495
as long as she stays here
with you

01:48:03.519 --> 01:48:04.537
and-and I'm gonna make good

01:48:04.561 --> 01:48:05.802
for all of
the potted plants

01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.187
that I ruined that time.

01:48:07.356 --> 01:48:09.689
I don't need for you
to do that, Joe.

01:48:10.275 --> 01:48:12.312
Pop, you don't understand.

01:48:13.404 --> 01:48:15.646
I need for me to do it.

01:49:33.233 --> 01:49:34.519
Kirs.

01:49:35.527 --> 01:49:36.938
Debbie asleep?

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:39.987
Yes.
It's after 11:00.

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.692
I didn't want her
to see me.

01:49:46.205 --> 01:49:49.289
- Well, you look so...
- So bad?

01:49:49.458 --> 01:49:51.825
Not as bad as you
imagined I would.

01:49:52.503 --> 01:49:54.540
Thanks for trying,
but I know how I look.

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:57.042
This is the way I look
when I'm sober.

01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:59.027
That's enough to make
a person drink

01:49:59.051 --> 01:50:00.292
wouldn't you say?

01:50:10.145 --> 01:50:11.477
Joe..

01:50:11.855 --> 01:50:14.097
...I haven't had a drink
in two days.

01:50:15.359 --> 01:50:17.146
Well, that's wonderful.

01:50:18.237 --> 01:50:19.398
It wasn't easy

01:50:20.072 --> 01:50:22.906
but I wanted to talk
to you, so I..

01:50:23.075 --> 01:50:24.316
I thought I'd try
and deserve it

01:50:24.493 --> 01:50:25.574
at least a little.

01:50:25.744 --> 01:50:27.235
Sort of a penance,
you might say.

01:50:27.663 --> 01:50:29.663
You'd be surprised how much
fun you can have sober,

01:50:29.748 --> 01:50:31.489
when you get
the hang of it.

01:50:32.459 --> 01:50:34.041
And you've got
the hang of it?

01:50:34.670 --> 01:50:35.751
I think so.

01:50:37.673 --> 01:50:39.005
Believe me,
it's the greatest.

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:40.443
Joe, wouldn't it
be wonderful if we could

01:50:40.467 --> 01:50:41.548
go back to the beginning?

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.092
Just erase everything
in between.

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:45.428
Start all over
at getting excited

01:50:45.597 --> 01:50:46.929
over a chocolate bar?

01:50:51.395 --> 01:50:52.806
I want to come home.

01:51:00.988 --> 01:51:03.150
I-I know what
you're thinking about.

01:51:05.868 --> 01:51:10.158
A lot's happened,
lots of... detours.

01:51:11.957 --> 01:51:13.685
There were plenty of them,
but they were nothing.

01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:16.417
I never looked at them.
They had no identity.

01:51:16.587 --> 01:51:19.045
I never gave anything
out of myself to them.

01:51:19.756 --> 01:51:23.591
I thought they'd help me
from being so lonely

01:51:24.011 --> 01:51:26.173
but I was just as lonely
because love is the only thing

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:27.532
that keeps you
from being lonely

01:51:27.556 --> 01:51:28.763
and I didn't have that.

01:51:30.017 --> 01:51:31.258
Kirs..

01:51:32.728 --> 01:51:34.288
...there's a little girl
asleep in there

01:51:34.313 --> 01:51:37.477
that would just love
to wake up and see you here

01:51:37.649 --> 01:51:39.857
and all you've got to do
is say the right words.

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.840
I don't know if I have
the right word.

01:51:41.904 --> 01:51:44.271
That's why it took me
so long to get here.

01:51:47.618 --> 01:51:49.234
You see, the world looks
so dirty to me

01:51:49.411 --> 01:51:50.947
when I'm not drinking.

01:51:51.496 --> 01:51:53.283
Joe, remember
Fisherman's Wharf,

01:51:53.457 --> 01:51:54.642
the water when
you look too close?

01:51:54.666 --> 01:51:55.727
That's the way
the world looks to me

01:51:55.751 --> 01:51:56.912
when I'm not drinking.

01:51:57.794 --> 01:51:59.397
I don't think I could ever
stop drinking completely,

01:51:59.421 --> 01:52:00.421
not like you.

01:52:00.464 --> 01:52:01.921
- I couldn't.
- You could.

01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:03.370
If I wanted to,
really wanted to?

01:52:03.425 --> 01:52:05.417
Well, I don't.
I know that now.

01:52:06.970 --> 01:52:09.007
I want things to look
prettier than they are.

01:52:10.933 --> 01:52:14.097
But I know... I know I-I could
be all right if you'd help me.

01:52:14.269 --> 01:52:16.932
I know I could, I'd be all right
if we were together and..

01:52:17.105 --> 01:52:18.374
...and things were like
they used to be

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:20.014
and I wasn't so nervous.

01:52:20.776 --> 01:52:23.016
I need to be loved. I get so
lonely from not being loved.

01:52:23.070 --> 01:52:24.356
I can't stand it.

01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.112
I love you.

01:52:27.366 --> 01:52:28.652
I'm afraid of you.

01:52:28.825 --> 01:52:30.612
I'm an alcoholic.
I can't take a drink.

01:52:30.786 --> 01:52:32.546
And I'm afraid of what
we'd do to each other.

01:52:32.579 --> 01:52:34.241
If you just say
that you'd try..

01:52:34.581 --> 01:52:35.697
I know this sounds crazy

01:52:35.874 --> 01:52:38.161
but I can't face the idea
of never having another drink.

01:52:38.335 --> 01:52:40.188
Honey, one day at a time.
Just one day at a time...

01:52:40.212 --> 01:52:41.212
I can't.
I can't.

01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:42.461
Doesn't it impress you

01:52:42.631 --> 01:52:44.191
that I have been sober
for almost a year

01:52:44.299 --> 01:52:46.040
and I'm delighted
to be this way?

01:52:46.218 --> 01:52:48.050
I'm working steady
and I feel great.

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:50.240
Debbie and I are living
in a decent place once again

01:52:50.264 --> 01:52:51.880
and it's all because
I'm sober.

01:52:52.432 --> 01:52:53.798
Yes.

01:52:53.976 --> 01:52:55.745
- Well, there's plenty of room.
- Joe, you're strong.

01:52:55.769 --> 01:52:57.556
That's why I know
you can help me now.

01:52:57.896 --> 01:52:59.256
If we only had it
back like it was.

01:52:59.314 --> 01:53:00.850
Back like it..

01:53:01.024 --> 01:53:02.606
Do you remember
how it really was?

01:53:02.776 --> 01:53:05.985
You and me and booze.
A threesome. Do you remember?

01:53:06.154 --> 01:53:07.754
Not that it wasn't
great while it lasted.

01:53:07.823 --> 01:53:09.815
We can have it back
that way again if...

01:53:09.992 --> 01:53:12.700
If I'll drink with you, but
I'm not gonna drink with you.

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:14.120
It's finished.

01:53:14.204 --> 01:53:15.604
I wouldn't ask you
to drink with me.

01:53:15.706 --> 01:53:17.163
I'd-I'd control myself.

01:53:17.416 --> 01:53:18.702
You can't control yourself.

01:53:18.875 --> 01:53:20.787
You're an alcoholic,
just the same as I am.

01:53:20.961 --> 01:53:22.042
No. No.

01:53:22.212 --> 01:53:23.623
You and I were
a couple of drunks

01:53:23.797 --> 01:53:26.289
on a sea of booze,
and the boat sank.

01:53:26.466 --> 01:53:28.278
I got a hold of something
that kept me from going under

01:53:28.302 --> 01:53:29.918
and I'm not gonna let go of it.

01:53:30.262 --> 01:53:32.003
And not for you,
not for anyone.

01:53:33.307 --> 01:53:35.549
If you want
to grab on, grab on.

01:53:35.892 --> 01:53:37.849
But there's just room
for you and me.

01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:39.020
No threesome.

01:53:52.993 --> 01:53:55.861
I can't get over
how dirty everything looks.

01:53:56.246 --> 01:53:58.408
Try it one more day.

01:54:00.250 --> 01:54:02.333
- Why?
- For her.

01:54:04.004 --> 01:54:05.336
Come and look at her.

01:54:17.351 --> 01:54:20.344
I can't.
I can't.

01:54:26.276 --> 01:54:27.767
You better give up on me.

01:54:29.404 --> 01:54:30.404
Not yet.

01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:33.481
Thanks.

01:54:35.869 --> 01:54:36.869
Goodnight.

01:54:39.247 --> 01:54:40.247
Kirs..

01:54:47.381 --> 01:54:48.713
...take care of yourself.

01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:01.471
Kirs!

01:55:38.807 --> 01:55:40.048
Daddy?

01:55:50.110 --> 01:55:52.102
I thought I heard you
call Mommy.

01:55:54.239 --> 01:55:56.071
You must have been
dreaming, honey.

01:55:56.783 --> 01:55:58.445
Let's go back to bed.

01:56:04.249 --> 01:56:06.707
When is Mommy coming home?

01:56:10.172 --> 01:56:11.788
Honey, mommy's sick.

01:56:12.299 --> 01:56:14.507
She has to get well
before she can come home.

01:56:16.011 --> 01:56:18.094
Is she going to get well?

01:56:20.724 --> 01:56:22.431
I did, didn't I?

01:56:27.355 --> 01:56:28.721
Go to sleep.

01:56:29.357 --> 01:56:30.393
Okay.

01:56:31.401 --> 01:56:33.108
Good night, Daddy.

01:56:33.278 --> 01:56:34.894
Good night, honey.
