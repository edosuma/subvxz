00:09.634 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:13.805


00:13.888 --> 00:15.015


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:32.198 --> 00:34.325


00:34.409 --> 00:37.454


00:38.079 --> 00:40.498


00:43.251 --> 00:44.502


00:44.586 --> 00:47.881
Campers,
there is something in the air.

00:47.964 --> 00:48.840
-

00:48.923 --> 00:50.592
And, no, it's not that.

00:50.675 --> 00:54.053
It's the Camp Splinterwood Bake-Off!

00:54.137 --> 00:57.515
Unfortunately,
only one cake can be the winner.

00:57.599 --> 00:58.475


00:58.558 --> 01:01.936
Which means most of you are losers,
and I get to use this…

01:02.020 --> 01:03.313
-
-…a lot.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.355


01:04.439 --> 01:05.565
And… go!

01:05.648 --> 01:07.650


01:08.985 --> 01:10.820
I'm feeling good about mine.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.031
Hey, any ideas
what goes well with cardboard?

01:13.865 --> 01:17.452
Uhh! You're never gonna win, Red.
I'm making poundcake!

01:17.535 --> 01:19.579
Uhh! Heavy on the pounding!

01:19.662 --> 01:22.499
I read that the faster you stir,
the more air you whip into your batter!

01:22.582 --> 01:24.167
But how much is too much? Huh…

01:24.250 --> 01:26.211
Maybe that was a little too much?

01:26.294 --> 01:27.420
-Mm-hmm.
-Nah.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.215
What are you making, Bomb?

01:30.298 --> 01:31.299
Uh…

01:31.382 --> 01:35.053
Hold on. Fizzberries, bluebernut butter,
truffles? What's this?

01:35.136 --> 01:39.724
Uh, nothin'! Just a recipe idea
I've been, uh, you know, toyin' with.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.894
Hey, Stella, Chuck. Check this out.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.523
Why is my mouth suddenly watering?

01:46.606 --> 01:48.483
Why is your mouth watering?

01:48.566 --> 01:50.485
What's happening to us?

01:50.568 --> 01:52.946
It's Bomb's recipe. It's great.

01:53.029 --> 01:55.073
No, actually, it's brilliant!

01:55.156 --> 01:56.366
You think so?

01:56.449 --> 02:00.411
Well, I've never told anyone,
but I have a dream of the perfect cake.

02:00.495 --> 02:04.124
A cake that makes the world better
just by existing.

02:05.708 --> 02:08.670
Bomb, you gotta make this cake
for the Bake-Off!

02:08.753 --> 02:10.255


02:10.338 --> 02:11.673
-
-Ohh.

02:11.756 --> 02:15.009
Even if I tried, I don't have
the right ingredients.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.719
Well, you know what I always say--

02:16.803 --> 02:20.181
when something's important to one of us,
we all band together to help!

02:20.265 --> 02:21.391
When have you said that?

02:21.474 --> 02:24.811
I've said all of those words…
just maybe not in that order.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.104
So, who's with me?

02:27.438 --> 02:29.649
You had me at cake.
We are making cake, right?

02:29.732 --> 02:31.484
I stopped paying attention
right after I heard the word "cake."

02:31.568 --> 02:33.695
Yes! Now, let's get Bomb what he needs

02:33.778 --> 02:37.198
and show Camp Splinterwood
what a cake should really be made of!

02:39.033 --> 02:41.119
Fizzlenut berries below!

02:44.664 --> 02:47.292
One serving of bluebernut butter
coming up!

02:48.209 --> 02:51.004
Only one place
to get the truffles Bomb needs.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.464
The Pig Camp!

03:06.603 --> 03:08.605
Wow! Because of you,

03:08.688 --> 03:10.732
I can actually make my dream cake!

03:10.815 --> 03:12.692
You know, with friends like you--

03:12.775 --> 03:14.569
Yeah, yeah, we're awesome.
No time for speeches!

03:14.652 --> 03:16.487
Tickity-tock, tickety-tock.
Clock's ticking!

03:16.571 --> 03:17.822
You got this, Bomb.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.347
-And… time!

03:42.430 --> 03:45.683
Bomb, you are, like,
disturbingly good at this.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.060
Okay, campers,

03:47.143 --> 03:49.229
-I'm ready to be disappointed.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.315
I am sure you all did great, great, great!

03:52.398 --> 03:55.485
Now, please bring your cakes
up to the judging table.

04:02.784 --> 04:03.785
-What a cake!
-Yeah!

04:05.411 --> 04:08.665
-Ooh, the acoustics on this one are nice!

04:08.748 --> 04:10.833
Maybe… to the untrained ear.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.502
All I hear is--

04:13.711 --> 04:14.712
Ohh.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.257
The competition is really tough.

04:19.842 --> 04:21.427
-Ooh!Solid.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.098
Oh, come on, campers!

04:25.181 --> 04:28.101
It's like you're
trying to be utter failures!

04:38.569 --> 04:40.154
Bomb, you made this?

04:40.238 --> 04:42.323
Uh… maybe?

04:43.449 --> 04:47.578
It's… incredible! Oh!

04:47.662 --> 04:49.831
-That's my friend!
-All right! Yes! Yes! Yes!

04:49.914 --> 04:51.791
Let me have a look.

04:51.874 --> 04:55.128
Girthy, aerodynamic…

04:55.211 --> 04:58.298
Oh, thanks. Is, uh, that good?

04:58.381 --> 05:03.678
It's close to, but not quite,
the worst thing I've ever laid eyes on…

05:05.346 --> 05:07.223
We have a winner!

05:07.307 --> 05:08.599
-Yeah, Bomb!
-That's my friend!

05:08.683 --> 05:10.935
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-Whoo! All right, Bomb!

05:11.019 --> 05:12.937
I won? Wow!

05:13.021 --> 05:15.106
I never could've made it without you!

05:15.189 --> 05:17.692
This cake's the best thing I've ever done!

05:25.033 --> 05:26.367
Wh-Wh-What's going on?

05:26.451 --> 05:29.537
I know, I'm just as surprised
as anyone that you won,

05:29.620 --> 05:32.332
but your cake will be the perfect ammo

05:32.415 --> 05:34.584
to win the food fight
against the Pig Camp.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.091
That's what this Bake-Off was for?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.092
Uh, duh.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.677
Wait, Bomb. You really didn't know?

05:44.761 --> 05:46.220
Yeah, I mean, what else
are you supposed to do

05:46.304 --> 05:48.806
with a delicious, appetizing,
mouthwatering cake?

05:48.890 --> 05:51.684
Exactly! And this one's a real beaut!

05:51.768 --> 05:54.604
Now excuse me while I hurl it
at those big dumb pigs.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.315
Wait! Oh… uh…

05:57.398 --> 05:59.650
Hey, look over there! It's a diversion!

06:01.027 --> 06:02.403
Uh, where's Bomb?

06:04.197 --> 06:07.116
Who gives a flying tail feather?
Where's the cake?

06:07.200 --> 06:10.745
The food fight's gonna start soon,
and that cake's our only shot.

06:10.828 --> 06:11.996
We have to find it!

06:15.917 --> 06:17.168
Where could he be?

06:19.170 --> 06:21.422
Don't take my cake! Please!

06:21.506 --> 06:24.884
Bomb, what's wrong? You won.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.219
You don't understand.

06:26.302 --> 06:30.515
The reason I don't compete in stuff
is so there's no chance of me losing.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.142
But then you made me think
I could actually win.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.268
And you did!

06:34.352 --> 06:37.563
Yeah, but it turns out winning is worse.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.399
This cake is the best thing
I've ever done.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.778
If they fling it, well, it's gone forever.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.699
Bomb, you made a winning cake,
and you deserve to hold onto that win.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.953
Like I always say, when something
is important to one of us--

06:52.036 --> 06:53.287
This again?

06:53.371 --> 06:56.165
Red, I've known you for years
and have never, ever heard you say that.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.126
I said it earlier,
like not even that long ago.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.377
He did, I can vouch for that.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.378
Whatever.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.880
Point is, Bomb, if you don't
want that cake to get flung,

07:02.964 --> 07:03.798
then we're gonna--

07:03.881 --> 07:05.758
Band together…

07:05.842 --> 07:08.344
Band together to keep it un-flung.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.513
-Couldn't have said it better myself.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.472
-Aah!
-Wh-whoa…

07:11.556 --> 07:12.807
-My cake!

07:14.142 --> 07:15.017
There's the cake!

07:15.101 --> 07:16.227
Get it!

07:32.660 --> 07:33.578
Oof!

07:33.953 --> 07:35.288
I got it! I got it!

07:36.330 --> 07:37.373
Nice catch, Bomb!

07:39.333 --> 07:40.793
Commence food fight!

07:45.089 --> 07:46.382
Run!

07:50.845 --> 07:52.180
Quick, under the slide!

07:56.434 --> 07:58.394
I think I saw them run over here.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.606
Oh, man, they're gonna find us!

08:01.689 --> 08:04.025
My poor cake. It's doomed!

08:05.818 --> 08:07.111
Aah! Uh-oh?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.988
Is my fuse lit? It's lit, isn't it?

08:09.071 --> 08:10.823
Ohh. I don't want to kill Cakey!

08:10.907 --> 08:12.783
I don't want you to kill Chucky!

08:12.867 --> 08:15.328
Don't worry, Bomb. We got this.

08:15.411 --> 08:19.540
It's like Red always says, when something
is important to one of us…

08:20.583 --> 08:22.919
Okay, we give up! You caught us!

08:23.002 --> 08:24.879
Where is the cake?

08:24.962 --> 08:27.173
Like we'd ever tell you, Neiderjerk!

08:27.256 --> 08:28.382
Uh, yeah!

08:28.466 --> 08:32.553
Bomb is definitely not hiding it
anywhere nearby, that's for sure.

08:32.637 --> 08:33.638
Mm-hmm.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.932
-Hmm…

08:40.186 --> 08:41.145
Uhh! Ptuh!

08:41.229 --> 08:42.271
Blah! Ugh.

08:42.355 --> 08:46.901
Okay, fine. If we can't fling the cake,
guess we gotta fling you!

08:46.984 --> 08:48.486
Ah, birdfeed.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.281
Bon voyage, losers.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.199
Stop!

08:55.409 --> 08:57.161
Bomb, what are you doing?

08:58.746 --> 09:00.873
Take the cake. Here.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.877
Okay, fine. I'll fling the cake.
And the traitors!

09:07.755 --> 09:11.217
What? I don't think so!

09:11.300 --> 09:12.885
Let's bake!

09:12.969 --> 09:15.638
Oh, could you, like,
take care of him or whatever?

09:27.692 --> 09:31.070
Neiderflyer, step away from the catapult!

09:31.153 --> 09:32.780
Mm… nah.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.130
Whoa!

09:55.177 --> 09:57.597
Stick a fork in me. I'm done.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.098
Mmm.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.474
Uh, what about us?

10:07.148 --> 10:09.025
It's been an honor.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.319
Uhh!

10:21.120 --> 10:23.331
-We did it!
-Yes!

10:24.624 --> 10:26.667
I don't get it.
You could have saved the cake.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.793
Why did you fling it?

10:27.877 --> 10:30.921
I realized I could always
bake another cake,

10:31.005 --> 10:33.090
but I can't bake new best friends.
