{\an1}get into it tonight?
Just not in the mood or what?

23:07.786 --> 23:09.855

You know, with Aubrey,

23:09.921 --> 23:12.591

23:12.657 --> 23:13.892
{\an3}my previous relationships
didn't work.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.861
{\an3}And if I just keep

23:15.927 --> 23:17.896
that's when [bleep] gets toxic.

{\an8}You was not in the room.

{\an3}- Exactly, Elena point-blank
showed me who she was.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.714
{\an3}There were things that
I'm like,

23:35.781 --> 23:37.949
{\an3}"This is--I'm not gonna be

23:38.016 --> 23:40.085
{\an3}Forced it anyways,

23:40.152 --> 23:43.722
{\an8}- [bleep], dude.
