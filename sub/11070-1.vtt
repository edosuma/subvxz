00:36.786 --> 00:41.457
A girl will never forget
the first boy she likes.

00:43.752 --> 00:47.087
Even if things don't quite work out.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.715
Why did you do that?

00:50.091 --> 00:51.967
Because you smell like dog poo.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.887
You're so stupid, just like dog poo.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.472
You're made out of poo!

00:57.599 --> 01:01.143
But usually someone is there
to offer words of wisdom.

01:01.311 --> 01:02.561
Made...

01:02.729 --> 01:04.104
...of...

01:04.522 --> 01:05.898
...dog...

01:06.066 --> 01:07.399
...poo.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.859
Honey...

01:09.027 --> 01:14.281
...do you know why that little boy
did those things and said those things?

01:14.449 --> 01:16.283
It's because he likes you.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.660
And there it is.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.497
That's the beginning of our problem.

01:22.457 --> 01:27.795
That little boy is doing those terrible things
because he's got a crush on you.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.296
Do you know what this means?

01:29.464 --> 01:30.589
We're all encouraged...

01:30.757 --> 01:31.924
...no, programmed...

01:32.092 --> 01:34.635
...to believe that if a guy
acts like a total jerk...

01:34.803 --> 01:37.262
...that means he likes you.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.351
Here's the problem:
He likes you too much.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.394
You're too pretty and too awesome.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.688
- Yes.
- He can't handle it.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.777
That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.154
I'm sure he just lost your number.

01:55.698 --> 02:00.285
He's not asking you out because he's
intimidated by your professional success.

02:10.170 --> 02:14.049
Trust me. It's because he's just
getting out of a serious relationship.

02:14.634 --> 02:18.220
Trust me. It's because he's never had
a serious relationship.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.734
Why do we say this stuff to each other?

02:33.236 --> 02:36.405
Is it possible that it's because
we're too scared...

02:36.573 --> 02:39.741
...and it's too hard to say
the one obvious truth...

02:39.909 --> 02:42.911
...that's staring everyone in the face?

02:59.762 --> 03:01.805
So Janine says
you're a real-estate agent.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.224
Yeah, but I'm not
one of those cheesy ones...

03:04.392 --> 03:07.311
...that puts my headshots on bus benches
and grocery carts.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.813
So just, like, Frisbees and notepads?

03:09.981 --> 03:11.023
Basically.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.108
- It's much classier.
- My thoughts exactly.

03:16.821 --> 03:19.448
Wonder why Janine never thought
to introduce us before.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.408
I don't know. I don't know.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.620
- Hey, guys. Want another round?
- You want one more?

03:25.788 --> 03:30.959
Only if you do. I mean,
if you need to get going, I totally...

03:32.295 --> 03:33.462
Uh...

03:34.130 --> 03:36.256
Okay, well...

03:37.800 --> 03:39.468
Sure. One more. Ketel and soda?

03:40.303 --> 03:41.929
And a beer, please.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.972
Be right back.

03:44.933 --> 03:48.977
Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.
- It was really nice meeting you.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.563
- Bye.
- See you.

03:59.822 --> 04:00.822
Hey, it's me.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.450
He's cute, and I think it went well.

04:03.618 --> 04:08.163
And I think he might be leaving me
a message at home as we speak.

04:08.331 --> 04:12.417
Hey, it's me. Just wanted to let you know
I was thinking about you.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.504
Oh, that's very sweet of you,
Conor. Thanks.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.673
Listen, I was wondering if you
wanted to grab a late bite.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.385
Tonight? I...

04:21.552 --> 04:25.639
No, I was supposed to meet friends
but I'm burnt out. Don't be mad at me.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.433
No, of course, I'm not mad.
Well, I'll be up for a while.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.519
- Do you wanna go ahead of me?
- I'll be up.

04:30.687 --> 04:31.937
- Oh, can you hold on?
- Okay.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.314
No, that's fine.
You just have one thing, so...

04:34.482 --> 04:36.275
No, technically I have six...

04:36.442 --> 04:40.028
...and I'm mulling over a gum purchase,
so I think you should go.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.530
Okay.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.990
Let me call you right back.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.199
All right. Okay.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.034
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.370
Just that and that, please.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.372
Thank you.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.044
Oh, my word.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.339
Seriously? That's not possible.

04:59.507 --> 05:02.551
I just deposited cash three days ago,
so it's just not possible.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.512
Oh, it's not that.
Let me check something.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.681
Congratulations, you won.

05:08.683 --> 05:09.725
What?

05:09.892 --> 05:13.937
Our Funky Fall promotion.
You're our 1000th customer this month.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.689
What?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.487
Are you kidding me?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.823
I don't do kidding.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.660
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this, it's so exciting.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.914
Oh, my God.
I never won anything before.

05:33.082 --> 05:36.543
This is the most exciting thing
that ever happened to me. Is that sad?

05:37.378 --> 05:39.629
Yea... No. I don't think so.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.215
- Really?
- Yes.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.426
Thank you! Come here.

05:45.928 --> 05:46.928
Wow.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.767
As the Terps move
to mid-ice, trying to...

05:51.934 --> 05:53.769
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:53.936 --> 05:56.938
- How was the date?
- It was fine. Whatever.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.066
- Why are you here?
- My cable's out.

05:59.233 --> 06:02.569
Come on, Spiewak,
it's not the Ice Capades.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.489
You didn't hear the phone ring
by any chance, did you?

06:05.656 --> 06:07.991
- No, I didn't.
- Shit.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.869
Anna gave me the old,
"I'll call you right back. "

06:11.037 --> 06:13.121
Oh, shit, yeah? Well, how long ago?

06:13.289 --> 06:17.042
That was 22 minutes ago.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.960
Do I call back?

06:19.128 --> 06:21.213
Should you call back? No, absolutely not.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.883
I'm gonna call back
and say I'm going to bed.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.803
What? No. It's 9:30. You're gonna...?

06:27.970 --> 06:29.137
No, it's a great idea.

06:29.305 --> 06:32.349
I'll call and say, "In case you were
gonna call me back, don't...

06:32.517 --> 06:34.643
...because I'll be sleeping. "
A genius idea.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.103
Okay, no, that's brilliant.

06:36.270 --> 06:39.481
When you wake up you can say, "I'm awake
now, I'm available to take your call. "

06:41.025 --> 06:42.692
Oh, gosh. A second.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.320
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.656
I was...

06:47.824 --> 06:49.616
Wait, what was I saying again?

06:50.034 --> 06:52.744
You don't wanna be like your mother,
wake up one morning...

06:52.912 --> 06:54.830
...and realize
you never pursued your dreams.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.289
Is that what I was saying?

06:56.457 --> 06:58.083
- You want some gum?
- No, thank you.

06:58.251 --> 07:02.087
God, that's kind of heavy
for a grocery chat.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.506
- No, that's okay.
- Isn't it?

07:04.674 --> 07:07.092
- Sorry.
- I actually might be able to help.

07:07.260 --> 07:11.513
Yeah, I know a guy at my office
who deals exclusively with music clients.

07:11.681 --> 07:12.806
Are you kidding?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.641
Oh, my God.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.102
- Are you my savior or something?
- No.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.105
- Can you hold this for a second?
- Yeah.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.358
Oh, this is so unexpected.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.663
Okay...

07:36.831 --> 07:37.873
I don't...

07:38.249 --> 07:40.208
I'm married.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.544
I don't do this.

07:42.712 --> 07:46.047
You don't do what?
You don't help struggling singers?

07:47.884 --> 07:53.221
Not hot yoga-instructing singers...

07:53.681 --> 07:56.266
...who are incredibly charming.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.604
Hm.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.483
Well, you could...
You could give me your card.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.068
That's legit, right? Is that allowed?

08:07.236 --> 08:08.320
I could do that.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.238
- Yeah.
- That'd be okay, right?

08:10.406 --> 08:12.073
Yeah.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.827
Great, thank you so much.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.746
Course. Do you need help to your car?

08:17.914 --> 08:20.165
- Where'd you park?
- No, I'm fine. It's okay.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.585
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.420
Okay.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.517
Who was that?

08:39.268 --> 08:43.897
Oh, that was a prospective client.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.191
Okay.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.403
I can talk to a woman.
It doesn't have to be like that.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.447
No. Absolutely not.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.909
- Just drive.
- Relax.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.805
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.140
- How you doing?
- Good.

09:19.308 --> 09:22.310
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I just got off the phone.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.479
- Yeah?
- Yeah, with my little sister.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.566
- How's she doing?
- She's getting married.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.484
Really?

09:29.652 --> 09:31.069
Yeah.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.362
Great.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.947
You really think that's great?

09:34.115 --> 09:35.699
Yeah.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.993
Devon seems like...

09:38.160 --> 09:39.911
...a great guy.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.792
Well, so you think it's great
that they're getting married...

09:45.960 --> 09:51.381
...but you don't ever feel like
we're going against nature, or something...

09:51.549 --> 09:53.883
...by not getting married?

09:55.511 --> 09:56.595
No.

09:57.179 --> 10:02.017
Going against nature
is like the cat who suckled that monkey.

10:02.184 --> 10:06.479
You and I are just two people
who happen not to be married.

10:06.856 --> 10:10.191
Let me tell you something. People
who get married are not to be trusted.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.569
You are so weird.

10:12.737 --> 10:13.987
They're not. You know why?

10:14.155 --> 10:16.865
Because if you are so legitimately happy,
honestly...

10:17.033 --> 10:19.743
...you wouldn't feel the need
to make a big show out of it.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.620
You wouldn't have to broadcast it.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.538
They do it because they're insecure...

10:23.706 --> 10:26.958
...and they think getting married's
what they're supposed to be doing.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.711
So they're lying to themselves
and to other people.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.212
Seriously.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.716
Think about you and your friends.
Okay?

10:34.884 --> 10:37.093
These women you have
great relationships with...

10:37.261 --> 10:40.138
...you're close to them,
some of them you've known for years.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.723
But you don't feel the need...

10:41.891 --> 10:47.354
...to write a $45 check to the state
of Maryland for a friendship certificate.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.189
- Yeah. No, I get that.
- Right?

10:49.357 --> 10:52.400
Why should it be any different,
you know, with me and you?

10:52.568 --> 10:56.196
We're very happy, I love you,
I'm committed to you...

10:56.364 --> 10:58.573
...we have a great life, you know?

10:58.741 --> 10:59.783
Yes, you're right.

10:59.950 --> 11:03.078
Why can't we just be happy?

11:03.245 --> 11:04.913
You're right.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.666
- I'm gonna get you some more tea.
- Okay.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.926
Please enter your pass...

11:18.094 --> 11:19.594
You have no messages.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.680
Main menu. To send a message...

11:24.725 --> 11:27.727
Okay, so clearly he hasn't called.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.688
Maybe he's away on business.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.899
He sells real estate. In Baltimore.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.402
- Staying in town is his business.
- Right.

11:35.569 --> 11:37.278
Well, look, let me tell you.

11:37.446 --> 11:41.241
After I went out with Ben for the first
time, he didn't call me for 11 days.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.952
Eleven days. And now
he's the world's best husband.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.286
That happens all the time.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.705
- Really?
- Really.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.998
You want coffee?

11:49.166 --> 11:51.626
- I got you 2 percent.
- Thanks.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.757
This is all your fault.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.759
What? Why?

11:59.927 --> 12:01.469
You set us up.

12:01.637 --> 12:07.475
No. You asked me if I know any guys,
and I gave Conor your phone number.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.269
That's not a setup.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.230
When I do a setup,
I weigh the pros and cons.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.482
I do my due diligence.

12:14.650 --> 12:19.112
All I know about Conor
is that he sold us this house.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.160
Seriously, stop.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.872
He said he always hangs out after work
at the City Supper Club.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.291
Maybe I should do a little drive-by?

12:32.084 --> 12:33.460
Please don't.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.670
He'll call.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.261
Okay, I have a question:

12:43.429 --> 12:45.013
Why'd they even invent caller ID?

12:45.181 --> 12:47.474
It's, like, who is this service helping?

12:47.641 --> 12:49.517
I mean, for centuries...

12:50.102 --> 12:53.772
Okay, well maybe not centuries,
but for, like, a lot and lot of years...

12:53.939 --> 12:57.025
...people have been answering their phone,
not knowing who it is...

12:57.193 --> 12:59.611
...and as far as I can tell,
no one's died from that.

12:59.779 --> 13:04.491
And it's like if the police wanna know
who placed a call, they could trace it.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.159
I mean, what am I, the police?

13:06.327 --> 13:10.038
This constant obsession with needing
to know who's calling all the time...

13:10.206 --> 13:11.498
...it's, like, so gross.

13:11.665 --> 13:15.293
Like, you pick up the phone,
you find out who it is, then you know.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.920
It's, like...

13:17.713 --> 13:19.547
Look, all I'm saying...

13:20.508 --> 13:24.344
...if a guy doesn't call me,
I would like to reserve the right...

13:24.512 --> 13:27.555
...to call him at 15-minute intervals
until he picks up.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.849
But if he looks down
and sees my numbers...

13:30.017 --> 13:33.311
...he's gonna think
I'm some kind of psycho or something.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.605
Which I'm not.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.482
Obviously.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.115
Hello?

13:46.283 --> 13:47.784
Mom.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.911
I gotta call you back.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.582
Inhale. Upward-facing dog.

13:54.750 --> 14:00.046
Look up towards the ceiling.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.966
He ordered more drinks for us
when the waitress came.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.093
He remembered exactly what I wanted.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.762
He initiated the hug.
He said it was nice meeting me.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.933
So wait. This was at the end of the date
or the beginning of the date?

14:12.101 --> 14:14.435
End. Why, does it matter?

14:14.603 --> 14:17.939
Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning
of the date, that's normal.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.358
"Nice meeting you"
at the end of the date...

14:20.943 --> 14:22.443
It could be a blowoff.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.445
Maybe it was at the beginning.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.699
Okay. That's fine. He's gonna call.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.284
Or maybe it was at the end.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.536
Or maybe it was just nice to meet me.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.204
Help.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.623
Hi. This is torture.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.751
How am I supposed to come up
with something pithy and dynamic...

14:38.919 --> 14:40.378
...to say about cinnamon blends?

14:40.546 --> 14:42.005
It's hard to focus on nutmeg...

14:42.172 --> 14:44.632
...when the guy who might be
the guy of my dreams...

14:44.800 --> 14:47.093
...refuses to call me.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.846
After my first date with Neil...

14:50.014 --> 14:51.055
...I called him.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.017
There are no rules anymore.

14:54.184 --> 14:57.812
And, I mean, why should you
have to wait for him to get off his ass?

15:02.318 --> 15:05.403
- It's ringing.
- That's pretty standard.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.447
- Hey, you've reached Conor.
- Yes! Voicemail.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.450
- Leave a message, I'll get back to you.
- Notes.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.452
"Hey, Conor, it's Gigi.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.579
I just thought, I hadn't heard from you...

15:14.747 --> 15:20.001
...and how stupid is it that a gal has
to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?"

15:21.962 --> 15:24.130
What does that say? What's that say?

15:25.507 --> 15:27.300
Because we're all equal, right?

15:27.468 --> 15:29.344
More than equal.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.347
More women are accepted
into law school now than men.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.933
And, I mean, I don't know
if you saw that Dateline...

15:35.100 --> 15:37.769
...but women practically
have penises now, right? So...

15:38.854 --> 15:39.896
Call me.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.523
Oh, this is Gigi. Call me.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.863
Don't worry, he's totally gonna call.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.882
What?

16:08.050 --> 16:11.386
How can there not be a dial tone?
How can there not be a dial tone?

16:11.887 --> 16:13.972
No dial tone. Come here, dial tone.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.390
Gigi, are you there?

16:15.557 --> 16:16.891
Hello, Gigi?

16:17.059 --> 16:18.518
- Mom, is that you?
- Yes.

16:18.686 --> 16:22.355
- I can't talk now, I'll call you back.
- Wait, I need you to...

16:29.571 --> 16:31.572
Hi, it's Janine. Leave a message.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.157
Hi, Janine, it's me.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.450
Conor never called...

16:34.618 --> 16:39.372
...so I'm on the precipice of staging
a casual run-in at the City Supper Club.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.416
Pick up if you wanna stop me.

16:42.751 --> 16:46.504
All right, I'm interpreting your silence
as tacit compliance. Bye.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.385
What's up, girl?
- Hey.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.721
- How are you?
- Good.

17:00.769 --> 17:01.853
Knock, knock.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.396
Hey.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.772
So...

17:06.733 --> 17:09.109
...here we are. Same shift again.

17:10.779 --> 17:13.531
I know. I make the schedule. Remember?

17:13.699 --> 17:17.117
Well, I figured it was no coincidence.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.124
I had...

17:23.959 --> 17:25.417
...a good time the other night.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.086
Yeah.

17:27.253 --> 17:29.797
It's amazing where 10 shots
of Patrón will get you.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.595
So I was thinking...

17:36.180 --> 17:38.848
...after work we could...

17:39.892 --> 17:40.933
You know...

17:42.102 --> 17:47.648
Look, Kelli Ann, what happened
between us the other night was fun.

17:47.816 --> 17:48.983
It was definitely fun.

17:49.151 --> 17:52.028
But we're way understaffed tonight.
I even have to man the bar.

17:52.196 --> 17:55.239
So that's why I scheduled you.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.283
To work.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.077
So...

18:01.455 --> 18:03.164
Are we good?

18:04.625 --> 18:06.667
- Nope, we're good.
- Okay.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.044
Hey, oh, Kelli Ann.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.630
Hey, babe, could you get the door?
Thanks.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.976
Hi. Are you joining us for dinner, or?

18:24.144 --> 18:25.478
I'm meeting someone. A guy.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.105
Why?
- Hm?

18:27.272 --> 18:29.148
Nothing. Sorry. For dinner?

18:30.901 --> 18:31.943
I'll wait at the bar.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.029
That's a great idea.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.789
What can I get you?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.374
Oh, no, I'm meeting someone.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.210
Oh yeah? What, you got a hot date?

18:50.212 --> 18:51.963
I don't know if you'd call it "hot. "

18:52.131 --> 18:54.382
This guy Conor and I
have only been out one time...

18:54.550 --> 18:56.175
Wait, wait, wait. Conor Barry?

18:56.593 --> 18:57.635
Yeah.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.804
Conor's not coming in tonight.
Thanks a lot.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.557
Did he forget he was
supposed to meet you here?

19:02.724 --> 19:06.561
Oh, see, when I said "meeting someone,"
I guess it was kind of a broad term.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.771
A wide interpretation
of the word "meeting. "

19:08.939 --> 19:11.023
Right. You know what? I'll call him.

19:11.191 --> 19:14.360
Oh, no. I mean, just totally unnecessary.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.822
Okay.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.782
I just was actually in the area...

19:19.950 --> 19:23.244
...and so I just figured I'd swing by
and see if he was around.

19:23.412 --> 19:27.707
Because I had to return his pen.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.959
Had to return this pen. He left this.

19:30.127 --> 19:35.089
And I just thought I should really return it
before he, you know, freaks out.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.717
Yeah. Okay, I'll get it to him.

19:38.635 --> 19:39.719
Thanks.

19:41.680 --> 19:45.558
"Wilson Ward, DDS,
Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry. "

19:46.602 --> 19:49.979
Look, I'm not going to judge what may
or may not be important to someone.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.690
Yeah. That's not even
his dentist, though.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.609
Oh, really. Who is?

19:55.444 --> 19:57.069
My dad.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.833
I'm Gigi. I went out
with Conor last week.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.419
And I just...

20:15.172 --> 20:18.007
I thought if I just ran into him...

20:19.885 --> 20:21.969
I don't know. I'm gonna go.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.763
Wait.

20:23.931 --> 20:24.972
Wait, just...

20:25.140 --> 20:27.225
Hang out for a second.
Let me buy you a drink.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.978
One drink. Okay?

20:31.813 --> 20:35.066
Give me two seconds, I'll be right back.

20:36.568 --> 20:40.821
Look, you seem like a cool girl,
so I'm just gonna be honest with you.

20:40.989 --> 20:43.282
Conor's never gonna call you.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.035
Oh, really. How do you know?

20:46.203 --> 20:48.746
Because I'm a guy,
and it's just how we do it.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.373
He said it was nice meeting me.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.084
I don't care if he said
you were his favorite female...

20:53.252 --> 20:55.586
...since his mommy
and Joanie Cunningham.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.923
Over a week went by, okay, Gigi?
And he didn't call you.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.717
But maybe he did call
and I didn't get the message.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.302
Or maybe he lost my number...

21:03.470 --> 21:07.515
...or he's out of town,
or got hit by a cab, or his grandma died.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.685
Or he didn't call because
he has no interest in seeing you again.

21:12.646 --> 21:16.274
Yeah. But my friend Terri once went
out with a guy who never called.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.025
She totally wrote him off.

21:18.193 --> 21:19.860
- Over a year goes by.
- Right.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.696
She ran into him,
and it ended up that...

21:21.863 --> 21:24.532
Your friend Terri's an idiot.
She's also the exception...

21:25.200 --> 21:26.701
...by the way.
The rare exception.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.745
Okay. Okay.
But what if I'm the exception?

21:29.913 --> 21:32.707
No, you're not. You're not at all.
In fact, you're the rule.

21:32.874 --> 21:37.253
And the rule is this: If a guy doesn't
call you, he doesn't wanna call you.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.046
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:39.214 --> 21:41.048
- Always?
- Yeah, always.

21:41.216 --> 21:45.219
Look, I know what blowing off
a woman looks like, okay?

21:45.387 --> 21:47.888
I do it early, I do it often.

21:48.056 --> 21:52.518
So trust me when I say if a guy
is treating you like he doesn't give a shit...

21:52.686 --> 21:55.187
...he genuinely doesn't give a shit.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.231
No exceptions.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.118
Thank you.

22:10.370 --> 22:12.413
Given me a lot to think about.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.755
Morning, morning.
Excuse me.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.089
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:22.257 --> 22:23.549
Everything okay?

22:23.717 --> 22:24.842
Oh, I was up all night.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.053
Please say you were working
on the nutmeg copy.

22:27.220 --> 22:30.348
Sure. It's basically done.
I have to tell you something important.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.391
Sweetie? What's going on with your hair?

22:32.559 --> 22:35.895
Yeah, come here before people
see you have a mini muffin in your hair.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.730
Okay.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.231
So...

22:41.777 --> 22:44.570
Thank you. I think I figured it out.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.865
Remember that notary public
who cheated on me?

22:48.033 --> 22:51.327
Then Anastasia told me her boyfriend
cheated on her at the beginning...

22:51.495 --> 22:54.622
...but then he changed and now
they're married and crazy in love?

22:55.248 --> 22:57.625
- I thought that guy was a process server.
- No, notary.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.753
Anyway, my point is,
Anastasia's the exception, not the rule.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.880
We have to stop listening
to these stories.

23:03.048 --> 23:06.133
The rule is that guys who cheat on you
don't care about you much.

23:06.968 --> 23:10.513
- Okay.
- Okay, so Exhibit A:

23:10.680 --> 23:13.474
Chad, the drummer who lived
in a storage space.

23:13.642 --> 23:17.478
He only used me for rides, and yet
I continued to stalk him for most of 1998.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.189
And then... Oh, there was Don...

23:20.357 --> 23:23.943
...who broke up with me every Friday
so that he could have his weekends free.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.986
I was delusional about that relationship.

23:26.154 --> 23:28.656
I'd refer to him as my husband
to my dental hygienist.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.117
And all of my friends
used to tell me stories...

23:31.284 --> 23:33.911
...about how things might work out
with these dipshits...

23:34.079 --> 23:36.872
...because they knew someone
who dated a dipshit like mine...

23:37.040 --> 23:38.999
...and that girl ended up getting married.

23:39.167 --> 23:42.253
But that's the exception.
We're not the exception, we're the rule.

23:47.801 --> 23:51.053
Okay, let me just see if I understand.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.930
So what you're saying is...

23:53.098 --> 23:56.392
...if I hear a story about a girl
who's been with a guy for 13 years...

23:56.560 --> 23:59.103
...and he finally married her,
that's the exception.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.896
Yes.

24:01.064 --> 24:03.941
But the rule are guys like Neil...

24:04.734 --> 24:08.028
...who are with girls like me...

24:08.196 --> 24:10.739
...for seven years and aren't married...

24:10.907 --> 24:12.491
...they're never getting married.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.326
- No.
- No.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.036
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- No.

24:16.204 --> 24:20.040
- It's not what she meant in that...
- No, it's got nothing to do with you.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.376
I absolutely was not talking about you.

24:22.544 --> 24:26.464
- These are specific relationship situations.
- I was talking about myself specifically.

24:26.631 --> 24:29.216
Just me specifically, you know?

24:33.680 --> 24:36.348
This guy is, like, impossible
not to like, you know?

24:36.516 --> 24:39.768
He's flirting with me pretty heavily
outside of the Handy Mart...

24:39.936 --> 24:44.064
...and, you know, everything just kind
of lines up, it's really magical.

24:44.232 --> 24:46.233
And then he tells me that he's married.

24:46.401 --> 24:48.819
Which, of course,
I should be pissed about, right?

24:48.987 --> 24:52.031
But I just can't stop thinking about him.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.407
But he's married.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.994
I know, I realize that.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.412
What's wrong with me?

24:59.956 --> 25:01.457
Okay.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.418
I know this guy,
he works in my dad's printing business.

25:04.586 --> 25:09.173
And he was married for 15 years
to a nice lady.

25:09.341 --> 25:14.053
And one night he meets this woman
at some church event.

25:14.221 --> 25:18.557
And he tells my dad that he's never
felt anything like it before.

25:19.226 --> 25:22.102
That he had finally met the one.

25:22.270 --> 25:24.021
So he divorced his wife...

25:24.189 --> 25:27.441
...and he's been with this other woman
for 22 years...

25:27.609 --> 25:29.944
...and they're insanely happy.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.696
I mean, what if you meet
the love of your life...

25:32.864 --> 25:34.949
...but you already married someone else?

25:35.116 --> 25:37.284
Are you supposed to
let them pass you by?

25:39.621 --> 25:43.040
You're right. Okay.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.875
I'm gonna call him.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.211
Okay.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.062
Hello?
- Hey, Ben. This is Anna Marks.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.648
Hey, Anna. What's up?

26:07.816 --> 26:10.901
Nothing, I was just...
I was taking you up on your offer.

26:11.069 --> 26:15.489
I know you said you had a couple
of contacts you thought could help me.

26:15.657 --> 26:20.953
And I thought maybe we could talk
about it over coffee or something like that.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.375
Look, I just...

26:28.211 --> 26:30.170
I can't, Anna.

26:31.339 --> 26:33.841
You seemed great. I just... I don't know.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.010
I should probably go.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.845
Take care, though. Bye.

26:45.729 --> 26:46.854
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.439
- I'm psyched you called.
- Cool.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.025
Kind of given up on you
when you didn't call me back.

26:51.192 --> 26:52.860
I was just thinking about you.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.862
- Want a glass of wine?
- Sure.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.864
Okay, what were the categories again?

26:57.032 --> 26:58.866
Four categories:

26:59.034 --> 27:02.578
Smart, sexy, funny and cute.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.913
But you can only be two things.

27:05.081 --> 27:09.418
Like Sarah Jessica Parker
would be funny and sexy.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.545
Bill Clinton would be smart and sexy.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.547
I can't believe you're hot for Clinton.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.257
Go. What am I?

27:15.425 --> 27:16.592
Wait, what was I again?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.594
You're smart and cute.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.805
Okay, you are sexy, very sexy.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.515
And cute.

27:24.434 --> 27:26.185
No, you can't...

27:26.353 --> 27:28.479
Sexy and cute
are both in the looks column.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.397
Nobody wants to be all in one column.

27:30.565 --> 27:34.568
I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four,
which obviously you are.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.904
Especially sexy.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.906
You're the best.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.663
I better go.

27:46.039 --> 27:50.042
Okay, well, you know
you could stay here if you want.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.461
What? It's been a while.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.380
No, I can't.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.965
I can't stay, I'm totally...

27:57.133 --> 27:58.759
I'm totally, totally fried.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.094
Is that okay?

28:00.261 --> 28:01.720
Yeah.

28:06.267 --> 28:07.851
I'll see you later.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.436
Bye.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.407
Hey.

28:21.991 --> 28:23.534
That look straight to you?

28:23.702 --> 28:25.911
Why are you hanging that?

28:26.830 --> 28:29.957
Because you asked me to
about three weeks ago.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.292
I'm getting around to it.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.503
Why? You don't want it here?

28:34.671 --> 28:36.380
No, I love it there. But just stop.

28:37.006 --> 28:39.007
Why? Is it the painting?

28:39.175 --> 28:44.138
You know, I know, it looks
kind of like a deflated boob here.

28:44.305 --> 28:45.639
Right? I know.

28:45.807 --> 28:48.267
It's gonna be depressing.
Should I take it down?

28:49.477 --> 28:52.312
No, I want you
to stop doing anything nice.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.483
This feels like a trick.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.110
- No.
- No?

28:58.278 --> 29:02.281
No, I just... I just need you
to stop being nice to me...

29:02.449 --> 29:04.450
...unless you're gonna marry me after.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.162
Is that funny?

29:08.329 --> 29:09.788
Do you think that's funny?

29:11.332 --> 29:13.333
No, I guess it's not funny.

29:13.501 --> 29:15.419
See, you can't keep being nice to me...

29:15.587 --> 29:19.298
...and I can't keep pretending
that this is something that it's not.

29:19.674 --> 29:22.760
We've been together
for over seven years.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.470
You know me, you know who I am.

29:24.637 --> 29:27.473
You either wanna marry me
or you don't.

29:29.976 --> 29:32.352
Or there's the possibility...

29:32.562 --> 29:35.856
...that I mean it when I say
I don't believe in marriage...

29:36.024 --> 29:38.692
Bullshit.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.195
Come on, it's bullshit for every woman...

29:41.362 --> 29:44.948
...that has been told by some man
that he doesn't believe in marriage...

29:45.116 --> 29:50.579
...and then six months later he's married
to some 24-year-old that he met at a gym.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.664
It's just... It's bullshit.

29:52.832 --> 29:54.291
Where is this coming from?

29:54.459 --> 29:57.503
From the place I've been hiding
from you for about five years.

29:57.670 --> 29:58.712
Okay.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.465
Five years, because I haven't wanted
to seem demanding.

30:01.633 --> 30:06.220
And I haven't wanted
to seem clingy or psycho.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.555
Or whatever.

30:08.723 --> 30:10.849
So I haven't asked you.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.894
But I...

30:16.022 --> 30:17.815
I have to.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.109
I mean...

30:23.738 --> 30:26.573
...are you ever gonna marry me?

30:44.801 --> 30:47.261
Oh, I can't do this anymore.

31:05.071 --> 31:07.239
I used to think that I had
never been dumped.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.408
Yeah, then we started comparing notes.

31:09.576 --> 31:13.620
Then we realized we've both been dumped
by every man we've ever been with.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.414
- Every one.
- Yeah.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.125
But they do it so skillfully.

31:18.293 --> 31:21.628
They just so sneaky
that you think it was your idea.

31:21.796 --> 31:24.006
Yeah. You're sitting back
and you're like:

31:24.173 --> 31:28.051
"Oh, yeah. This my idea.
But wait a second, why am I alone?"

31:28.219 --> 31:30.721
"Why am I unhappy?
Why have I gained 20 pounds?"

31:30.889 --> 31:33.307
- They Jedi mind-trick you.
- Yes, they do.

31:33.474 --> 31:34.892
- So they do a soft pass.
- Yeah.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.144
They got little lines they like to tell you.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.146
Like, "I don't wanna stand in your way. "

31:39.314 --> 31:42.733
Or, "You're perfect,
it's just I have to work on myself. "

31:42.901 --> 31:44.985
Right. "I'm just thinking
of your happiness. "

31:45.153 --> 31:47.738
"Oh, I don't deserve you. "
That's my favorite one.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.323
You know the other one I like?

31:49.490 --> 31:51.950
"I am so jealous of the guy
who gets to marry you. "

31:52.118 --> 31:53.911
- Well, that could have been you.
- Yeah.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.787
That's what I was leaning towards.

31:55.955 --> 31:57.915
Yeah. And the second you hear that...

31:58.082 --> 32:01.084
...run to the store, get yourself some ribs
and some ice cream...

32:01.252 --> 32:03.003
...because you have been dumped.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.589
Hey Anna, it's Ben.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.675
Listen, I know it's been a while
since you called.

32:08.843 --> 32:11.929
It's just... It took me by surprise.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.514
But I did offer to help you
with your career...

32:14.682 --> 32:16.767
...and I don't see why
I can't do that, right?

32:16.935 --> 32:18.518
So why don't you give me a call...

32:18.686 --> 32:21.229
...and maybe you can
come by the office or something.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.899
Okay? All right, take care. Bye.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.192
Hey, you.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.402
Oh, shit.

32:27.570 --> 32:30.530
- What?
- You scared me.

32:30.698 --> 32:32.532
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.534
Everything's fine.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.078
Are you smoking again?

32:36.245 --> 32:38.330
No, sweetie, I'm not smoking.

32:38.498 --> 32:39.539
Why?

32:39.707 --> 32:41.208
You get jumpy when you smoke.

32:41.376 --> 32:42.960
I'm not smoking, I promise.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.212
No, I was just sitting here...

32:45.380 --> 32:49.049
...trying to picture what this room's
gonna look like when it's finished.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.467
- I like that game.
- You do?

32:50.635 --> 32:52.052
Yeah.

32:53.137 --> 32:55.681
What color did you picture?

32:55.848 --> 32:57.808
That's where I got stuck.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.393
Yeah.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.479
I was thinking...

33:03.064 --> 33:05.774
...maybe yellow.

33:06.442 --> 33:09.361
- Yellow? Okay.
- Yeah. I mean, it's neutral.

33:09.529 --> 33:13.365
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah. So it could be whatever.

33:13.533 --> 33:17.035
It could be an office,
it could be a guest room...

33:17.203 --> 33:19.913
...a gym, a baby's room...

33:23.751 --> 33:26.628
Wait, did you mean "neutral,"
or "gender-neutral"?

33:26.796 --> 33:30.382
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, really?

33:32.301 --> 33:35.012
I know we said
we'd wait to talk about it.

33:37.765 --> 33:43.520
But I think that we're almost ready
to start talking about it.

33:59.912 --> 34:02.456
So that's the last time
I do anything pro bono.

34:05.752 --> 34:08.754
Well, ladies, I guess
I have to get back to the office.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.591
You go back to the office after happy hour?
What's happy about that?

34:12.759 --> 34:14.301
I met you.

34:16.637 --> 34:19.139
I would love to call you sometime.
Do you have a card?

34:20.975 --> 34:22.141
- Of course.
- Oh, great.

34:22.310 --> 34:25.478
Here is my info.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.565
- Nice to meet you, Janine.
- Nice to meet you.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.984
Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.

34:33.154 --> 34:34.654
Oh, wait.

34:36.114 --> 34:37.407
So...

34:37.824 --> 34:39.242
...how are we doing this?

34:39.409 --> 34:42.411
Are you hearing from me
or am I getting a call?

34:42.580 --> 34:43.621
What?

34:44.123 --> 34:45.791
You said you'd love to call me...

34:45.958 --> 34:48.835
...but then you said,
"Look forward to hearing from you," and...

34:49.003 --> 34:50.920
You see how that's kind of confusing?

34:51.089 --> 34:53.965
Yeah, look, we'll talk. We'll get in touch.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.469
You did it again. Very vague.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.305
You know what?
Let's just say that you'll call me...

35:00.473 --> 35:03.058
...and then we can skip all the nonsense.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.102
Goodbye, Gigi.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.865
- He was cute.
- Yeah, please don't cyber-stalk him.

35:21.327 --> 35:22.869
What are you doing?

35:23.037 --> 35:24.204
I'm not calling him.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.706
If he wants to see me, he'll call.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.166
Wow.

35:28.334 --> 35:31.378
That guy Alex really
made an impression on you.

35:31.546 --> 35:32.712
Was he hot?

35:32.880 --> 35:35.423
No. He was just...

35:35.633 --> 35:36.800
...right.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.803
Morning.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.555
Morning, Ryan.

35:41.722 --> 35:44.599
A surprise mocha venti
just because you're so awesome.

35:44.767 --> 35:47.227
- Love you.
- Love you.

35:48.187 --> 35:49.479
Good morning.

35:59.782 --> 36:01.908
Okay.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.580
So?

36:07.623 --> 36:08.707
Oh, hi.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.506
- He asked me out.
Oh, my God. He called?

36:18.009 --> 36:20.218
Well...
- He e-mailed?

36:20.386 --> 36:21.887
- No.
What?

36:22.054 --> 36:24.097
Left his calling card
with your lady-in-waiting?

36:25.766 --> 36:29.060
- He MySpaced me.
- Ouch.

36:29.353 --> 36:33.607
- Oh.
- Oh, girl, I don't know about that.

36:33.774 --> 36:37.402
My trampy little sister says
MySpace is the new booty call.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.780
Well, what am I supposed to do?

36:40.948 --> 36:42.616
I mean, things have changed.

36:42.783 --> 36:45.118
People don't meet each other
organically anymore.

36:45.286 --> 36:49.247
If I would like to make myself seem
more attractive to the opposite sex...

36:49.415 --> 36:52.459
...I don't go and get a new haircut,
I update my profile.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.544
That's just the way it is, you know?

36:55.922 --> 36:57.130
Yeah, she's right.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.549
Back, back, back, back.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.636
Ad sales, this is Mary.

37:02.803 --> 37:06.973
Hi, Mary, this is Conor,
Anna's friend, or whatever.

37:07.141 --> 37:08.141
Hi.

37:08.559 --> 37:11.061
So, what'd you think?

37:11.229 --> 37:13.563
Looking at it right now.
I'm not sure about this.

37:13.731 --> 37:14.981
Oh, you have to trust me.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.734
It's a burgeoning market,
you're gonna make a fortune.

37:17.902 --> 37:21.029
I know. Did you have to put me
with the massage ads?

37:21.197 --> 37:24.783
Well, it was either that or the page
with the personals, so...

37:24.951 --> 37:26.826
This page gets a lot of action.

37:26.994 --> 37:28.828
Yeah, I guess you're right.

37:28.996 --> 37:30.664
Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?

37:30.831 --> 37:32.457
Yeah.

37:34.335 --> 37:36.002
Okay.

37:37.171 --> 37:39.464
All right, Mary,
I'll talk to you soon. Thank you.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.049
Bye.

37:41.801 --> 37:44.928
What I'm trying to show you is
that there's a difference.

37:45.596 --> 37:46.888
There is a difference.

37:47.056 --> 37:50.892
Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda
to sew these dresses in two weeks?

37:51.060 --> 37:52.310
She wanted to do it.

37:52.478 --> 37:55.855
Really? She told me she felt like
an old Indonesian lady in a sweat shop.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.774
- Is that not right?
No, she didn't.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.025
No?

37:59.193 --> 38:03.446
What's the...?
Why the big rush to get married?

38:03.614 --> 38:07.951
Because I am not having my wedding
during a gross Baltimore winter...

38:08.119 --> 38:09.995
...and I am not waiting till spring.

38:10.162 --> 38:12.163
You are so pregnant.

38:12.331 --> 38:13.873
Oh, God, I'm not pregnant.

38:14.041 --> 38:16.001
I'm not pregnant. That's ridiculous.

38:16.168 --> 38:18.378
- Chug a beer then.
No, I'm not chugging a beer.

38:18.546 --> 38:19.546
Chug a beer.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.464
We're in love, you assholes.

38:21.632 --> 38:25.218
That's what people do
when they're in love, they get married.

38:28.055 --> 38:31.641
But you know what?
Not everybody gets married, you know?

38:31.809 --> 38:35.312
There are many people
who never get married.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.106
Well, thanks
for the inspirational pep talk.

38:38.274 --> 38:42.360
What she meant to say was that it's fine
that you broke up with Neil.

38:42.528 --> 38:43.570
Right.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.489
Tons of people make the choice
to be alone. They're happy.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.075
Look at Al Pacino.

38:49.243 --> 38:52.537
Never been married, happy as a clam.

38:52.705 --> 38:56.333
Would that...? Am I...?
Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?

38:56.500 --> 38:58.585
No, Bethie, we just...
We want you to be happy.

38:59.003 --> 39:02.088
Well, then you should have
rethought the coral.

39:02.256 --> 39:04.132
Oh, her face.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.759
- Your face.
- Don't make her cry.

39:05.926 --> 39:07.927
I'm sick of these coral jokes.

39:08.095 --> 39:11.014
I know, you're sensitive.
Trust me, I get it.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.768
Hey, why don't you have dinner
with me and Steven and the kids...

39:14.935 --> 39:16.478
...then you can just stay over...?

39:16.645 --> 39:19.022
Why'd she wanna hang out
with you and your husband?

39:19.190 --> 39:20.774
The last thing I'd feel like doing.

39:20.941 --> 39:22.859
If being in this wedding is too painful...

39:23.027 --> 39:26.654
Oh, God, you guys. Please, stop it.
Relax, relax.

39:27.114 --> 39:29.449
That's enough, okay?
Seriously, you guys, I'm f...

39:29.617 --> 39:33.787
I've gone through breakups before.
If you remember, I handle them quite well.

39:33.954 --> 39:38.291
You've been there, you've seen it.
I'm perfectly capable of doing this.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.043
I can do it again.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.420
I want you to stop worrying about me.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.464
I'm fine.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.467
I know it's here somewhere.

39:47.635 --> 39:52.680
I spoke with George Lane in Music.
He had a whole list of references for you.

39:54.058 --> 39:57.977
Well, that's okay.
You can just call me when you find it.

40:00.523 --> 40:03.817
I swear I didn't lure you here
under false pretenses.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.693
I know.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.237
A girl can dream, though.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.325
You're just too good a guy.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.292
Why are you married again?

40:23.754 --> 40:25.380
Seriously, why?

40:25.548 --> 40:28.258
No, I really think
that it would be good for me to know...

40:28.426 --> 40:31.302
...why you cannot live
without this other woman.

40:32.721 --> 40:37.851
Well, we'd been together since college
and she gave me an ultimatum.

40:38.018 --> 40:41.646
She said, "Either we get married
or we break up. "

40:41.814 --> 40:43.189
So we got married.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.317
Wow. You caved.

40:48.529 --> 40:49.696
It's complicated.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.573
Really?

40:53.117 --> 40:57.162
What? You're a dick if you date a girl
for too long and don't marry her.

40:57.705 --> 41:00.832
You marry her and you're an asshole
for marrying before you're ready.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.419
I mean, shit, I don't know.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.476
You're really hot.

41:20.352 --> 41:23.188
And I am obviously attracted to you.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.775
So I think the best I can do is...

41:28.736 --> 41:32.530
...eventually find this piece of paper
and call you...

41:33.199 --> 41:36.826
...and hope to just help you out in
your career in some small way.

41:47.838 --> 41:48.880
Hi.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.174
Hi. What's going on?

42:00.059 --> 42:01.768
Javier.

42:03.521 --> 42:07.106
Javier, I thought we talked
about tarping the furniture.

42:49.316 --> 42:50.358
City Supper.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.402
Hi, this is Gigi. Is Alex there?

42:52.570 --> 42:54.028
Hold on.

42:54.196 --> 42:55.989
- Alex?
- Yo.

42:56.156 --> 42:58.116
- Drinks are good?
Yeah, one more.

42:58.284 --> 43:00.285
- Hello?
- Hi, this is Gigi.

43:00.452 --> 43:02.287
- Gigi?
- Gigi Phillips.

43:02.454 --> 43:05.081
- Huh?
- I, um...

43:05.249 --> 43:06.749
...had the dentist pen.

43:06.917 --> 43:09.085
Right. Hey. How you doing?

43:09.253 --> 43:12.046
- I'm really sorry to bug you.
- That's okay.

43:12.214 --> 43:15.425
You had some really good insights
and I wanted to ask you a question.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.094
Okay, look, now I need
to be harsh with you.

43:18.262 --> 43:20.805
Conor's never gonna be
interested in you, Geege.

43:20.973 --> 43:24.017
No, I know. This is about Jarrad.

43:24.184 --> 43:25.268
Jarrad.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.354
So we meet at happy hour
and he's completely charming...

43:28.522 --> 43:32.442
Hey, give me two seconds, okay?
Two seconds, hold on.

43:42.703 --> 43:43.745
Let me guess. He said:

43:43.912 --> 43:46.372
"The only thing happy
about this hour is you. "

43:47.875 --> 43:50.376
He might have used
some derivative of that.

43:53.255 --> 43:57.216
So he says he's going to call, but then
he gives me his card and he says...

43:57.384 --> 43:58.885
Oh, he's not interested.

43:59.053 --> 44:01.888
- You don't even know if he's called.
- Oh, did he?

44:02.473 --> 44:03.514
No.

44:04.058 --> 44:07.060
- But I honestly think he's expect...
- Okay.

44:07.227 --> 44:11.522
Gigi, he is not interested.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.108
Alex, this is jacked.

44:14.276 --> 44:17.070
The hostess is giving me shit
for not wearing a black shirt.

44:17.237 --> 44:18.613
- It's not black.
- Look at it.

44:18.781 --> 44:21.741
Not a black shirt. I see it. It's not black.

44:21.909 --> 44:23.576
This shit is black.

44:26.872 --> 44:30.708
If a guy gives you his phone number
instead of taking yours, he's not interested.

44:30.876 --> 44:32.460
He took mine first. Then he gave...

44:32.628 --> 44:36.089
And also, if a guy wants to see you,
believe me, he will see you.

44:38.217 --> 44:42.095
I once called 55 Lauren Bells
until I got the right one.

44:42.763 --> 44:43.930
That's cute.

44:44.098 --> 44:45.181
What happened?

44:45.349 --> 44:48.810
Oh, yeah, as it turns out,
her ass looked really huge in the daylight.

44:50.646 --> 44:53.606
Is it your sensitivity that makes you
so popular with women?

44:53.941 --> 44:56.275
Don't call him. He doesn't like you.

44:56.735 --> 44:58.444
Don't tiptoe around my feelings.

44:58.612 --> 45:01.239
- Well, I'm just trying to help.
- I know. Thank you.

45:01.407 --> 45:02.824
Sure.

45:02.991 --> 45:05.785
I gotta get back to work, but good luck.

45:05.953 --> 45:07.745
Okay, bye.

45:12.126 --> 45:13.376
Hey, buddy, you home?

45:13.544 --> 45:15.795
Yeah. Come on in.

45:19.133 --> 45:20.883
Hey, you want a beer?

45:22.511 --> 45:24.679
Or an apple martini?

45:24.847 --> 45:26.180
Oh, that's funny.

45:28.142 --> 45:29.892
Have you told your parents?

45:30.060 --> 45:32.603
It's for work.
I'm trying to expand my client base.

45:32.771 --> 45:34.564
By pretending to be gay?

45:34.732 --> 45:37.442
No, by being more gay-friendly.

45:37.609 --> 45:39.652
Or, in real estate terms, "gay-adjacent. "

45:39.820 --> 45:41.446
Nice. I'm gonna use that.

45:41.613 --> 45:44.031
I should change this.
It's maybe a little much.

45:44.199 --> 45:47.785
I don't know. Dressing like that,
seeing a girl who won't sleep with you...

45:47.953 --> 45:49.412
...I think you can pull it off.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.789
It's not that she won't sleep with me,
douche bag.

45:51.957 --> 45:54.417
I have slept with her.
It's just she, you know...

45:55.461 --> 45:57.462
Won't sleep with you anymore.

45:57.963 --> 45:59.839
Pretty much, yeah.

46:00.424 --> 46:02.008
What do you think?

46:02.176 --> 46:03.509
I think you got a problem...

46:03.677 --> 46:07.764
...because you're gonna have to beat them
away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man.

46:07.931 --> 46:09.182
Holy shit.

46:09.683 --> 46:11.893
Observe your breath.

46:12.644 --> 46:15.480
Inhale, belly rise.

46:17.191 --> 46:20.777
And exhale, belly fall.

46:22.112 --> 46:24.781
Bring your hands together
in front of your chest.

46:25.532 --> 46:28.117
Bow your head in gratitude.

46:32.372 --> 46:35.208
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

46:35.375 --> 46:37.460
Thank you for coming.
See you next week.

46:41.381 --> 46:42.882
Great class.

46:54.895 --> 46:56.813
We ran into each other.

46:57.856 --> 46:59.148
You came to my class.

47:00.067 --> 47:01.651
I had no idea this was your class.

47:03.195 --> 47:05.655
You called to ask me
if this was my class.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.198
No, you never called back.

47:07.366 --> 47:10.284
Because you told me not to call you
if it was my class. It was.

47:10.452 --> 47:12.745
- No. We just ran into each other.
- Okay.

47:12.913 --> 47:17.583
We're just two innocent folks who happen
to be working out near each other.

47:17.751 --> 47:19.710
Exactly.

47:21.755 --> 47:23.047
Do you want a swim?

47:24.216 --> 47:25.258
Sure.

47:31.765 --> 47:33.683
You know, I was just thinking...

47:35.394 --> 47:36.727
...why can't we be friends?

47:37.479 --> 47:40.523
I mean, am I not allowed
to have friends anymore?

47:40.941 --> 47:44.777
I mean, am I not allowed to be friends
with people that are hot?

47:44.945 --> 47:47.655
I mean, what kind of
reverse prejudice is that?

47:47.823 --> 47:49.031
I hear you.

47:49.199 --> 47:50.700
I mean...

47:50.868 --> 47:54.287
...am I not supposed to be friends
with a guy just because he's married?

47:54.454 --> 47:55.454
Right.

47:55.622 --> 47:57.540
Or has an insane smile?

47:57.708 --> 48:00.084
Or an ass that makes me
wanna dry hump?

48:05.382 --> 48:08.718
- Did you just say "dry hump"?
- Yeah.

48:12.347 --> 48:13.723
Think I just fell in love.

48:20.314 --> 48:22.106
So we're friends.

48:22.983 --> 48:24.233
Yeah.

48:59.561 --> 49:00.937
You wanna come in?

49:04.816 --> 49:06.525
I'm sorry, I don't trust myself.

49:07.152 --> 49:09.946
That's okay. You can just watch.

49:12.532 --> 49:15.493
You know, you may be
the best friend I've ever had.

49:26.880 --> 49:29.256
- Hi.
- Hey.

49:35.097 --> 49:37.974
Take a shower. Hey.
- What? Hi.

49:38.141 --> 49:40.142
- Honey?
- Yeah.

49:41.937 --> 49:43.813
You smell weird.

49:43.981 --> 49:46.065
- I smell weird?
- Yeah, different.

49:46.233 --> 49:49.485
- Different how?
- I don't know.

49:51.238 --> 49:52.738
Sort of an odd thing to say.

49:52.906 --> 49:56.242
You know, maybe it was the ashtray
and cigarettes I found.

49:56.410 --> 49:58.327
In the back yard.

49:59.037 --> 50:02.498
What part of
"My dad died of lung cancer"...

50:02.666 --> 50:05.668
...is so hard for you
to wrap your brain around?

50:05.836 --> 50:06.877
What?

50:07.045 --> 50:10.548
Do not lie to me, Ben. Please, okay?

50:14.886 --> 50:16.846
Are you serious?

50:20.183 --> 50:25.563
We have, like, 8000 undocumented
workers here daily.

50:25.731 --> 50:30.401
Okay, and you find an ashtray
with cigarettes in it and you think...

50:30.569 --> 50:33.612
You automatically assume
that they're mine.

50:33.780 --> 50:35.364
Oh, yeah.

50:35.532 --> 50:37.616
Honey, I'm not lying to you.

50:42.664 --> 50:44.373
I think...

50:45.125 --> 50:47.376
...you are really freaking out.

50:47.753 --> 50:51.547
This whole renovation thing's getting
to you because nothing's happening.

50:57.304 --> 50:59.180
Just say no.

50:59.347 --> 51:00.598
Get it out.

51:00.766 --> 51:01.932
Gonna take a shower.

51:02.476 --> 51:04.810
- I'm exhausted.
- Okay.

51:08.315 --> 51:11.650
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

51:21.411 --> 51:23.662
Who'd have thought that a random girl
from yoga...

51:23.830 --> 51:27.750
...would fix me up with such a good kisser?
- Back at you, sister.

51:31.338 --> 51:32.963
I can't wait to kiss you again.

51:33.590 --> 51:35.174
But we're kissing right now.

51:35.342 --> 51:36.509
I know, next time.

51:36.676 --> 51:39.386
The second-date kiss
is way more intimate.

51:41.348 --> 51:42.556
Well, listen...

51:42.724 --> 51:46.227
...I'm leaving tomorrow,
so I'll be out of touch for a little bit.

51:48.730 --> 51:51.607
Can you excuse me a quick second?
Too many Diet Cokes.

51:52.067 --> 51:53.234
Okay.

52:11.545 --> 52:12.628
Oh, yeah.

52:12.796 --> 52:13.879
Yeah?

52:14.047 --> 52:16.799
Hey, sorry to bug you again.
Quick question.

52:16.967 --> 52:19.260
Excuse me one minute, babe. Sorry.

52:19.427 --> 52:21.387
What's going on?

52:21.555 --> 52:24.557
Okay, I'm making out with this guy...
PG stuff.

52:24.724 --> 52:28.185
And he mentions that he's going
out of town, he's gonna be out of touch.

52:28.353 --> 52:29.478
Run.

52:30.230 --> 52:32.231
But maybe he is going out of town.

52:32.399 --> 52:35.025
Where? Where's he going
that he's gonna be out of touch?

52:37.696 --> 52:39.572
Where are you going
out of town to again?

52:39.739 --> 52:41.991
Um... Uh... Pittsburgh.

52:43.535 --> 52:44.702
Pittsburgh.

52:44.870 --> 52:45.995
Run.

52:46.163 --> 52:49.582
So, what, now I'm just supposed to run
from every guy who doesn't like me?

52:50.208 --> 52:51.876
Yeah.

52:52.752 --> 52:55.379
There's not gonna be anybody left.

52:56.423 --> 52:58.674
I don't know why I'm saying this...

52:58.842 --> 53:01.677
...but I think I know a nice guy
who might actually like you.

53:01.845 --> 53:03.554
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

53:03.722 --> 53:05.806
He's friends with my brother.
His name's Bill.

53:05.974 --> 53:08.517
We'll all meet for drinks and it'll be good.

53:08.685 --> 53:12.730
So, I mean, I'm in his bathroom
right now.

53:12.898 --> 53:13.939
What do I do?

53:14.107 --> 53:18.235
Well, you gotta come out eventually, right?
But I'd take my time in there.

53:18.653 --> 53:20.446
I'd let him sweat.

53:20.614 --> 53:22.907
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

53:52.979 --> 53:54.730
Yeah, the boat looks great.

53:54.898 --> 53:56.440
You look like shit.

53:56.608 --> 53:58.484
But your boat looks great.

53:58.652 --> 54:02.488
Yeah. I live on my boat, man.

54:02.656 --> 54:04.782
Personal hygiene goes out the window.

54:04.950 --> 54:07.201
A lot of time to work on the place.

54:07.369 --> 54:09.203
You should try working on a shower.

54:09.371 --> 54:10.996
Yeah.

54:11.331 --> 54:14.333
Hey, what can I tell you?

54:14.501 --> 54:18.462
Standing on principle, man. It's all I got.

54:22.592 --> 54:24.093
Cigarette?

54:24.261 --> 54:25.469
No, I'm good.

54:25.637 --> 54:27.972
That's right, you quit.

54:29.099 --> 54:30.599
Good for you.

54:36.690 --> 54:40.859
So did Janine send you out here
to check up on me?

54:41.486 --> 54:43.279
Yeah, pretty much.

54:43.446 --> 54:45.322
What are you gonna tell her?

54:46.116 --> 54:49.326
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look
out here on the ocean.

54:50.662 --> 54:52.663
Break.

54:52.831 --> 54:54.623
Any word from Beth?

54:56.126 --> 54:59.545
She's so busy organizing
her sister's funeral, I think she must be...

54:59.713 --> 55:00.838
Sister's what?

55:01.006 --> 55:03.007
Her wedding. Her sister's wedding.

55:03.174 --> 55:05.801
- Isn't that what I said?
- No. You said "funeral. "

55:05.969 --> 55:07.553
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

55:07.721 --> 55:09.346
Shit, did I really?

55:09.514 --> 55:11.724
That's so weird.

55:12.142 --> 55:14.393
I don't understand
why people wanna get married.

55:16.438 --> 55:17.521
They don't.

55:17.689 --> 55:19.231
- They don't?
- No.

55:19.733 --> 55:22.735
No, no guy actually wants to get married.

55:22.902 --> 55:26.113
And if they do,
all they're really thinking about?

55:26.281 --> 55:28.490
All the women
they're gonna miss out on.

55:28.658 --> 55:30.868
I don't wanna be with anybody else,
just Beth.

55:32.746 --> 55:34.580
I don't know, man, I...

55:34.748 --> 55:36.415
Why'd you get married?

55:38.668 --> 55:40.586
I love Janine.

55:40.754 --> 55:42.379
You're a happily married guy.

55:43.131 --> 55:44.840
Yeah.

55:45.008 --> 55:47.051
Yeah, I'd say so.

55:53.558 --> 55:55.726
Now, I know I don't need
to tell any of you...

55:55.894 --> 55:59.563
...that my cousin Paige is hot.

56:01.441 --> 56:04.651
In high school, if I told the popular guys
that Paige was my cousin...

56:04.819 --> 56:06.904
...it'd keep me
from getting my ass kicked...

56:07.072 --> 56:09.782
...because no one wanted
to blow their chances with her.

56:11.368 --> 56:16.038
And when she gets up there
and says those marriage vows to Devon...

56:16.206 --> 56:18.916
...there will be hearts breaking
all over the world.

56:19.084 --> 56:20.959
Hear, hear.
That's sweet.

56:22.379 --> 56:27.758
But, you know, keep in mind
that her sister Beth is still on the market.

56:28.927 --> 56:31.637
Yeah, sure, she may be an older model...

56:31.805 --> 56:34.556
...but she got a lot of good miles
left in that tank.

56:34.724 --> 56:36.475
But don't stay on the lot too long...

56:36.643 --> 56:39.561
...or next year's models are gonna
slip in there and steal all...

56:39.729 --> 56:41.730
Okay, that's enough of the speeches.

56:41.898 --> 56:42.940
Okay.

56:43.108 --> 56:44.983
So enjoy the crab.

56:45.151 --> 56:50.906
And that yellow stuff is not hot mustard,
it's the crab's hepatopancreas.

56:54.536 --> 56:55.828
Bethie.

56:57.205 --> 57:00.040
Your cousin Jay
has always been a jackass.

57:00.208 --> 57:01.250
I know.

57:01.709 --> 57:04.002
And somehow even he's married.

57:05.505 --> 57:07.840
Oh, honey, look.

57:08.007 --> 57:11.468
Back when everyone
was just going to camp at the Y...

57:11.636 --> 57:13.637
...you borrowed my New York Times...

57:13.805 --> 57:16.181
...found some arts camp
in the Berkshires...

57:16.349 --> 57:19.518
...wrote away for information
and got accepted on your own.

57:19.686 --> 57:22.354
You never did things like everyone else.

57:22.522 --> 57:23.814
Why not?

57:23.982 --> 57:25.524
Because that's you.

57:26.025 --> 57:28.861
That's why you're my favorite daughter.

57:29.487 --> 57:31.947
You're not supposed to say that.

57:32.115 --> 57:33.949
I don't give a shit.

57:34.117 --> 57:36.660
I'm retired, I'll say what I want to.

57:36.828 --> 57:38.829
I'll say it to the whole room if you want.

57:38.997 --> 57:41.748
Wait, wait, wait! Come here. Stop.

57:41.916 --> 57:43.792
It's true, though.

58:01.102 --> 58:02.144
Hey.

58:03.980 --> 58:06.231
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.

58:09.986 --> 58:11.820
Come on.

58:16.159 --> 58:17.242
Sorry I'm late.

58:17.410 --> 58:18.744
No, it's okay.

58:18.912 --> 58:20.829
I like a little time before a blind date.

58:20.997 --> 58:24.708
Prepare myself mentally, remind myself
not to tell the story about my molars...

58:24.876 --> 58:26.084
Gigi, he's not coming.

58:26.252 --> 58:29.463
But you can tell me the story
about the molars. I'd love to hear it.

58:29.631 --> 58:31.423
Hey.

58:31.591 --> 58:33.258
How could he already not like me?

58:33.426 --> 58:36.678
I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday,
not Tuesday. It's my fault.

58:36.846 --> 58:38.263
Hi. Are you good?

58:38.431 --> 58:40.516
- Can I get a Jameson on the rocks?
- Sure.

58:43.269 --> 58:46.730
Awesome. I'm stuck with a guy who
can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday.

58:46.898 --> 58:50.984
Meanwhile, this girl, she's probably
meeting her soul mate as we speak.

58:51.152 --> 58:52.611
This one right here?

58:52.779 --> 58:54.279
Oh, God, no.

58:54.948 --> 58:56.657
How do you know?

58:57.450 --> 58:59.368
The guy working the Tom Cruise thing?

58:59.536 --> 59:01.870
She's interested, he's clearly not.

59:02.038 --> 59:05.040
You cannot tell from a cursory glance
that he's not into her.

59:05.208 --> 59:07.876
Actually, I can.
I see this stuff going on every night.

59:08.044 --> 59:10.629
Watch this. She's going on
about her macrobiotic diet.

59:10.797 --> 59:13.048
He's thinking,
"Dear Christ, get me out of here. "

59:13.216 --> 59:14.633
And look, how fortuitous.

59:14.801 --> 59:17.469
Drinks spill, which is perfect for him,
because now...

59:17.637 --> 59:19.888
He can move on to the girl
with the shoulder tattoo.

59:21.182 --> 59:22.975
Man, you have a gift.

59:23.142 --> 59:25.269
Now check out Droopy Dog
on the other side.

59:25.436 --> 59:29.481
He's gonna buy her drinks all night and
she's still gonna insist there's no spark.

59:29.649 --> 59:31.775
Maybe there's not. You need a spark.

59:31.943 --> 59:34.778
Oh, the spark thing is bullshit.

59:34.946 --> 59:36.530
- Really?
- Bullshit.

59:36.698 --> 59:38.031
Enlighten me.

59:38.199 --> 59:39.866
Guys invented the spark...

59:40.034 --> 59:43.870
...so they could not call and treat you
kind of badly and keep you guessing...

59:44.038 --> 59:47.791
...then convince you that that anxiety
and fear that just develops naturally...

59:47.959 --> 59:49.543
...was actually just a spark.

59:49.711 --> 59:52.921
And you guys all buy it.
You eat it up and you love it.

59:53.089 --> 59:56.300
You love it because you feed off
that drama. You all love that drama.

59:56.467 --> 59:57.509
I don't.

59:57.677 --> 01:00:01.013
So you never wait until the last minute
on a deadline or a phone bill...

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.056
...because secretly you love the drama...

01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:05.684
...of not knowing whether or not
you're gonna make it?

01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:08.020
Maybe.

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:09.771
And let me guess:

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:12.190
When you were stalking Conor
the other night...

01:00:12.358 --> 01:00:14.526
...were you obsessing
about him calling...

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.904
...constantly pacing back and forth,
staring at your phone for days...

01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:20.574
...even though the date
was just kind of mediocre?

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.578
Okay. Yeah.

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:27.414
Because you all thrive on the drama.
Thank you.

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:30.417
Look, you gotta be more like me.
If a girl likes me, great.

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:33.795
But if not, there are plenty more
out there like her, you know?

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.006
With smaller pores and bigger implants.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:39.009
- That's beautiful.
- I know.

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:42.804
Why are you sharing all of this inside
dating information with me again?

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.806
I don't know, I like you.

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.142
You do?

01:00:49.228 --> 01:00:52.814
Well, yeah. Okay, don't start doodling
my name on your binder, okay?

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:57.027
I just mean... I mean, I like you
the way I like basset hounds.

01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:59.988
Something pathetic about them.
You just wanna cheer them up.

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:02.199
Again with the sensitivity.

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:04.409
To sensitivity.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:13.669
It looks good.

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.253
Yeah.

01:01:15.421 --> 01:01:16.963
Yeah.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.592
- He does good work.
- Yeah, he does.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:24.388
Very nice.

01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:30.102
Very nice.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:35.524
- Javier?
- Yeah.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:38.652
Javier...

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.114
...if I asked you an honest question...

01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:44.700
...do you think you could
give me an honest answer?

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:47.828
- I think so.
- Good, good.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:52.290
Because I think some of your guys
might be smoking.

01:01:53.292 --> 01:01:54.793
Javier?

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.753
- Is that the question?
- Yes.

01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:59.464
- Seemed like a statement.
- The question part's implied.

01:01:59.632 --> 01:02:02.092
I really didn't hear it in the inflection.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.593
Javier...

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:06.138
...have you guys been smoking...

01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:08.056
...or not?

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:13.478
No, ma'am. My guys, they don't smoke
on the job site. They're good guys.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.148
Are you sure your guys haven't been...

01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:18.650
...sneaking around here?

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:19.901
And smoking?

01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:23.071
And lying to me?

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.489
And smoking?

01:02:24.657 --> 01:02:25.741
I'm pretty sure.

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:28.326
I need you to be honest with me, Javier.

01:02:28.494 --> 01:02:30.871
Because I can't have someone
lying to me.

01:02:31.038 --> 01:02:34.499
To my face, under my roof,
on my time.

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:36.418
That's a lot of prepositions.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:41.256
I mean, there's no reason
for that kind of dishonesty, is there?

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:44.760
I mean, we made promises to each other.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:48.096
I mean, we have a contract.

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:51.266
That's like making promises. Isn't it?

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:55.187
Maybe I should get back to work.

01:02:57.648 --> 01:02:59.691
Oh, yeah. Right, yeah.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:02.194
That's great, yeah.

01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:05.030
- Javier?
- Yeah.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.533
We're good. Right? You and me.

01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:11.703
- Oh, yeah, yeah. We're good.
- Oh, good.

01:03:12.246 --> 01:03:13.705
Okay, that's great.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.874
Yeah, he did great work.

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:22.714
Hey.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.843
Welcome, everybody.
Thanks for coming. I'm Conor.

01:03:27.011 --> 01:03:29.554
Sign in when you get a second.
Make yourselves at home.

01:03:29.722 --> 01:03:32.891
We got some cookies over here,
some cold beverages. Help yourself.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:35.644
Conor, you are the Liza Minnelli
of real estate.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:39.564
- I know. Your friend Mary's a genius.
- I know, she's so great.

01:03:40.733 --> 01:03:44.236
Well, I gotta go,
so I guess I'll see you later.

01:03:44.403 --> 01:03:45.737
What, you got a class, or?

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:49.241
Yeah. No. No, just something.

01:03:49.408 --> 01:03:51.868
- Stuff I gotta do.
Okay. Well...

01:03:52.036 --> 01:03:54.996
- I'll see you. Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:57.415
Okay. Bye.

01:03:57.583 --> 01:03:59.501
- See you later.
All right. Call me.

01:04:03.881 --> 01:04:04.923
What?

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.718
She's holding out on you, isn't she?

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:12.514
Not quite sure I get your meaning.

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.766
It's obvious she won't sleep with you.

01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:18.353
It's written all over your puppy-dog face.

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:22.899
- It's killing me, literally. I'm dying.
- Here, have a cookie.

01:04:23.067 --> 01:04:24.484
No, I'm cool.

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:27.320
I don't know what she's doing.
I cannot read her signals.

01:04:27.488 --> 01:04:29.364
We used to sleep together all the time.

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:34.452
That's not true.
I don't know why I said that.

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:38.123
It wasn't all the time, but it happened.
I know I'm not just making this up.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:41.126
And then out of nowhere it just stops.
But she still calls.

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:44.462
She wants a massage.
She leaves cute messages.

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:47.132
But it's not going anywhere.
What is she doing?

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.260
Honestly, we may not
have the best insight.

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:53.388
Gay signals have nothing
to do with straight signals.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:56.308
He's right.
The signals are totally different.

01:04:56.475 --> 01:05:00.228
Like, here.
Here's "I wanna sleep with you. "

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:03.815
One, two, three.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:06.318
That's it, three seconds or more, it's on.

01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:09.154
And here's
"I don't wanna sleep with you. "

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.822
One, two...

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:13.658
- Nope, thanks for playing, move along.
- It's that simple.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:16.953
You're right, that didn't help me at all.

01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:18.997
All right, well, I can tell you this:

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:22.167
Gay or straight, you're not gonna
get anywhere by being inactive.

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:25.629
She likes you. Maybe she just wants you
to be a man and do something.

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.842
Hit me up with an oatmeal raisin,
will you?

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.428
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:38.808
If a girl's into you,
she's sleeping with you.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:42.437
If after a month,
or two months at the very outside...

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.689
...she's not sleeping with you?

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:47.192
She doesn't like you.

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:49.444
The trick is to spot this girl early.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:53.531
Don't wanna waste the one to seven weeks
waiting to find out it's never gonna happen.

01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:57.535
So I've come up with some signs
about how to spot this girl.

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:01.039
A girl will never sleep with you...

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:04.292
...if she calls you "cuddly"
or "dependable. "

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.628
If she pops a zit in front of you...

01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:10.340
...if her name is Amber or Christine...

01:06:10.716 --> 01:06:12.717
...if she takes a dump in your bathroom...

01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:16.471
...or she takes home leftovers
on dates one, two, or three.

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:19.099
I know it's not scientific...

01:06:19.266 --> 01:06:21.559
...but I'm just saying,
you were warned.

01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:44.749
Wait, stop.

01:06:48.045 --> 01:06:49.087
What?

01:06:49.755 --> 01:06:51.506
Shit.

01:06:52.299 --> 01:06:53.341
What?

01:06:55.803 --> 01:06:57.387
I am so into you.

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.432
Seriously, I've never felt like this before.

01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:04.269
I have to actively stop my brain
from thinking about you.

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:06.938
Like, all the time.

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:11.860
Why stop?

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:17.032
Because I don't do stuff like this.

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.075
Stuff like what?

01:07:20.953 --> 01:07:22.871
Like sleep with women
that aren't my wife.

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:27.459
First of all, I am not "women,"
I'm just one.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:29.461
And second of all?

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:32.797
Oh, I didn't have a second of all.

01:07:32.965 --> 01:07:35.759
I was hoping "second of all"
would make me feel better.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:42.432
Second of all...

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:46.478
...I can't stop thinking about you either.

01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:02.327
He's totally leaving his wife for me.
That's crazy.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.579
That's crazy. We hardly know each other.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.831
I don't know. I mean, look at Becca.

01:08:06.999 --> 01:08:08.625
You know, my sister's friend.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.502
One guy waits on her at Bennigan's...

01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:14.005
...and by the end of the meal,
they both knew they had found the one.

01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:18.635
You're right. You're totally right.
I mean, it could happen, right?

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:20.970
Not for me.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.846
What about texter?

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:25.683
Texter has yet to make verbal contact.

01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:29.854
I mean, this guy could've had surgery,
leaving him without a voice box...

01:08:30.022 --> 01:08:31.481
...breathing through a stoma...

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:35.109
...and I would never know because
I've never actually heard his voice.

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:37.194
Well, I doubt he has a stoma.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:40.448
That's not the point. I can't text.

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:42.783
You know, I'm not charming via text.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.577
Maybe you should just stop texting.

01:08:44.745 --> 01:08:49.707
But it's not just texting, it's e-mail.
It's voicemail. It's snail mail.

01:08:49.875 --> 01:08:51.000
That's regular mail.

01:08:51.167 --> 01:08:52.877
Whatever. None of it's working.

01:08:53.045 --> 01:08:58.049
I had this guy leave me a voicemail
at work, so I called him at home.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:02.679
And then he e-mailed me to my BlackBerry,
and so I texted to his cell.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:07.767
Then he e-mailed me to my home account
and the whole thing just got out of control.

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:13.231
And I miss the days where you had one
phone number and one answering machine.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:16.151
And that one answering machine
housed one cassette tape...

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:19.988
...and that one cassette tape either
had a message from the guy or it didn't.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:23.366
And now you have to go around
checking all these different portals...

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:26.578
...just to get rejected
by seven different technologies.

01:09:26.745 --> 01:09:28.580
It's exhausting.

01:09:29.081 --> 01:09:31.249
What about that MySpace guy?

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:33.960
- Jude. I like him.
- Good.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:37.046
Yeah, I felt like we connected.

01:09:37.214 --> 01:09:38.506
Great.

01:09:38.756 --> 01:09:41.551
What if she wants you to kiss her?

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:45.430
Well, then I guess
I'm just gonna have to kiss her.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.348
"Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer...

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:50.560
...who'll be swept off her feet
at the touch of your amateur lips. "

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.938
This babe has plenty of battle scars.

01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:55.440
Hello?

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:58.109
Oh, hey, you're home.

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:00.612
Where am I supposed to be?

01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:03.698
Out, maybe? It's Saturday night.

01:10:04.116 --> 01:10:07.619
You won't let me go out with guys
who don't like me. It's kind of limiting.

01:10:07.786 --> 01:10:10.038
Right. Listen, I was just gonna
leave a message.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.707
I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come.

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:17.378
Oh, I don't know. Won't Conor be there?
Might be kind of awkward.

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:21.466
He's at a real-estate conference in D.C.
But there'll be a lot of single guys.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:24.219
So there will be plenty of chances
for me to be awkward.

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:26.888
Don't worry, I'll be there.
I'll talk you through it.

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:29.307
Okay, gotta go.

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:32.560
Someone just dropped like 84,000 plates.
Maybe I'll see you there.

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:35.146
You're busy. I shouldn't have called.
You called me.

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:37.398
- Yup, good.
- Bye.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:43.988
How...? How do you work on it?

01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:47.242
Pretend I'm a girl, okay?

01:10:48.452 --> 01:10:49.953
I mean...

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:51.663
...pretend I'm her.

01:10:52.539 --> 01:10:54.207
Amanda.

01:10:57.461 --> 01:10:58.711
He's into me.

01:10:58.879 --> 01:11:01.047
Awesome. I knew it.

01:11:01.215 --> 01:11:03.174
- Who's this now?
- Alex.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:06.594
It's totally clear to me now. He's Watts.

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:09.931
- He's what?
- From Some Kind of Wonderful.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.141
I thought Mary Stuart Masterson
was Watts.

01:11:12.309 --> 01:11:14.519
- Yes.
- So why aren't you Watts?

01:11:15.145 --> 01:11:16.688
I'm Eric Stoltz.

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:21.359
Alex is Watts. Watts helps Eric Stoltz
go on a date with Amanda Jones.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:23.361
Really, she's in love with Eric Stoltz.

01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:26.197
So Amanda Jones is Conor?

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:30.952
I guess. At first. Now men in general,
but that's not the point.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.996
The point is he's into me.

01:11:33.163 --> 01:11:36.624
I knew there had to be some reason why
he was spending that time with you.

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:40.378
I know. It's so obvious now.
There are so many signs.

01:11:40.546 --> 01:11:44.007
Signs. Love signs. You gotta
tell me about the signs. I love signs.

01:11:44.174 --> 01:11:48.094
First they were small. At first when I
called, he said, "Good to hear from you. "

01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:49.721
- Totally good sign.
- Right?

01:11:49.888 --> 01:11:52.515
And then the next time I called
he was with a woman...

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:55.393
...but he took the call
and we talked for a while.

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:57.603
- You know it was a woman?
- Called her "babe. "

01:11:57.771 --> 01:12:01.733
Okay, a guy doesn't leave a woman
to go talk to another woman unless he's...

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.234
And it gets more obvious.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:07.405
I mean, please. There was no guy
he was gonna fix me up with.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:09.032
The fix-up was him.

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:10.325
No.

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:14.412
Yes. He shows up
without this fictitious Bill character.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.331
The two of us basically have a date.

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:21.419
And then he calls and invites me
to a party at his place.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:24.005
He so likes you.

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:27.759
I'm so happy for you.

01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:30.845
Let's look up places
for your destination wedding.

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:36.934
How do you feel about Napa Valley?

01:12:37.102 --> 01:12:39.270
I have really always wanted to go there.

01:12:42.399 --> 01:12:44.025
Oh, he's cute.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.611
Yeah. Smoldering but sensitive.

01:12:47.404 --> 01:12:51.741
Oh. "All I have is my guitar, these chords,
and the truth. "

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:53.117
Bon Jovi.

01:12:53.285 --> 01:12:55.661
- That's hot.
- Yeah. I like him.

01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:59.916
I mean, he probably hasn't called yet
because we just had coffee last night.

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:02.251
- Really?
Yeah, you know.

01:13:02.419 --> 01:13:05.630
I mean, we actually video
iChatted while holding coffee.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:07.465
But that's the same thing, right?

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:09.801
- Right, right.
- Just call your voicemail.

01:13:09.968 --> 01:13:13.805
Yeah, but he had a gig last night
and he probably didn't get home till late.

01:13:13.972 --> 01:13:15.973
Did I tell you he's a singer?

01:13:16.141 --> 01:13:17.892
- Just call.
Oh, honey, no, on speaker.

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:20.812
I don't think so.
I'm sure he hasn't called.

01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:22.480
- Just call him.
- Okay.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:31.697
You have two new messages.

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:35.493
Mary

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:39.539
Whoa, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:43.042
Oh, my Mary

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:45.253
I just got hard.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:46.921
Hey, Mary, it's Jude.

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:51.008
I was just calling to tell you again
how special it was to meet you.

01:13:51.176 --> 01:13:54.762
So call me back. Bye-bye.

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:57.932
Amazing.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.560
This is good, this is good.
- This is...

01:14:00.727 --> 01:14:01.978
See, he called.

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:03.855
Jenny

01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:07.942
Whoa, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:11.320
Hey, Jenny, it's Jude.
I was just calling to...

01:14:11.488 --> 01:14:15.533
Whoa, shit. What number did I just dial?

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.703
All messages erased.

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:31.215
That one.

01:14:31.383 --> 01:14:32.467
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:36.053
No. It's a laminate.

01:14:37.055 --> 01:14:39.515
- That's not real hardwood floor?
- Nope.

01:14:39.683 --> 01:14:43.186
It looks exactly like it. But it is
like one one-hundredth of the cost.

01:14:46.106 --> 01:14:47.899
I still wanna go with the real wood.

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:50.985
What? You can't even tell the difference.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:52.904
It's not the point.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:55.239
Well, what is the point?

01:14:55.407 --> 01:14:57.116
I just...

01:14:57.576 --> 01:15:00.286
I don't like the way
it's pretending to be wood.

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:03.080
If you're not wood,
don't try and look like wood.

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:05.917
I don't think that it's pretending.

01:15:07.085 --> 01:15:08.753
This is a lie, Ben.

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:12.590
Just be up front
and tell people what you really are.

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.511
Okay, you're right. You're right.

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:18.304
I'm sorry.

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:24.769
It's okay. Maybe we should just go
look at the grills and we'll come back.

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:26.729
Okay.

01:15:31.276 --> 01:15:33.236
I slept with someone.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:43.955
- I said...
- I heard you.

01:15:48.293 --> 01:15:51.504
You tell me this in Home Depot
because you know I hate a public scene.

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:54.382
No, that is not why I'm telling...

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:58.427
I knew it.

01:15:58.595 --> 01:16:00.471
- You asshole.
- I'm sorry.

01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:05.434
It is you that's been smoking too,
isn't it?

01:16:06.019 --> 01:16:08.479
Wha...? Wait, what does that
even matter?

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:10.356
Have you...?!

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:13.276
Have you been smoking?

01:16:13.443 --> 01:16:14.777
No. No, I haven't.

01:16:22.035 --> 01:16:23.327
I talked to Neil. I told him.

01:16:23.495 --> 01:16:25.329
He said I could stay
at his boat for a while.

01:16:25.497 --> 01:16:26.789
Excuse me?

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:30.001
Now you're moving out?

01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:32.086
- You're, like, leaving me?
- No.

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:35.464
No, I just assumed
that you wouldn't want me to...

01:16:36.508 --> 01:16:40.177
Aren't we gonna deal with this?

01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:44.348
Don't you wanna find some way...

01:16:44.516 --> 01:16:47.143
...for us to work through this?

01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:51.522
I assumed that when I told you,
you would want me...

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:53.482
...out.

01:16:56.194 --> 01:16:57.945
Is that what you want?

01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:12.501
No.

01:17:14.921 --> 01:17:18.174
Okay.

01:17:41.239 --> 01:17:43.741
You're doing a great job.

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:53.584
Oh, my gosh, it's Bridget. Hi!

01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:59.215
Oh, my goodness.

01:18:02.552 --> 01:18:04.929
Oh, what a beautiful dog.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:18.526
Seriously, Devon, I really did feel
just a moment, a splash, of hesitation.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:21.028
No, there wasn't.
There wasn't any hesitation at all.

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:23.280
You just did it again. That was a pause.

01:18:23.448 --> 01:18:25.700
I did not pause.

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:33.999
You must be Beth.

01:18:36.461 --> 01:18:38.504
Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:40.965
Heard a lot about you from Paige.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:45.428
Actually been lobbying
to sit next to her single sister for weeks.

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:47.888
Oh, yeah?

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:50.516
So you must be:

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:52.309
"Dan. "

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:54.311
Sort of.

01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:58.524
- Sort of?
- Well, I'm actually a Wiccan.

01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:00.401
- A what?
- A Wiccan.

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:02.153
Wiccan?

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.904
- Male witch.
- Right.

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:06.657
So I also have a magical name.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:09.326
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.

01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:12.830
But I didn't know if that would fit
on the card. Love that.

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:15.666
I'm guessing that I'm gonna
hear a whole lot about you.

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:18.335
Nature-based
pre-Christian paganism, yeah.

01:19:18.503 --> 01:19:20.504
Yeah. That's fantastic.

01:19:20.672 --> 01:19:22.089
Well, where to begin?

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:25.259
Well, first off, it's not just a bunch
of nude farming. Dad.

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.511
Let's look at Stonehenge.

01:19:27.679 --> 01:19:28.971
Obviously not a coincidence.

01:19:29.139 --> 01:19:32.141
They didn't have the machinery
to move those rocks. They're huge.

01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:34.018
- Yeah, they're heavy.
- Of course.

01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:06.383
- I'm Nathan. And this is Bruce.
- Gigi.

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.053
- Gigi. Hi.
- Hey.

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:13.474
So how do you guys know Alex?

01:20:14.726 --> 01:20:18.395
We don't. Our friend Mary heard
about this from some guy named Conor.

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:23.609
And how do you know Alex?

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:27.112
I hope...

01:20:27.447 --> 01:20:30.950
I'm pretty sure that something's
about to happen between us.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:36.580
So are you here as, like, a guest,
or, like, his date?

01:20:36.748 --> 01:20:40.459
Oh, I hate that.
When you don't know if you're a date.

01:20:40.627 --> 01:20:43.921
You don't know if you should bring
a friend, or are you co-hosting...

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:46.757
...or should you stay to the end
to have some alone time?

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:49.426
He didn't say.
I'm sure I'm more than just a guest.

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.096
- I mean, there have been signs.
- Cool.

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:19.623
So where's Neil?

01:21:19.791 --> 01:21:20.875
We broke up.

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:23.294
- No way.
- Yeah.

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:25.963
You guys were together,
what, like 10 years?

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:27.923
Seven. But still, it's a long time.

01:21:28.091 --> 01:21:29.216
Yeah.

01:21:29.801 --> 01:21:32.678
It's too bad cousins can't marry,
because then we could maybe...

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:34.805
Oh, Dominic.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.224
- Gross.
- No.

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:40.978
Ken, are you okay? What happened?

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:44.315
Oh, my God.

01:21:44.482 --> 01:21:46.775
Ken, are you all right?
Just clutched his chest.

01:21:46.943 --> 01:21:48.903
He was standing there
and all of a sudden...

01:21:49.362 --> 01:21:51.113
Ken, just try to breathe.
Call 911.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:52.406
Dad. Excuse me.

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:55.075
Daddy, what is it? What happened?
What happened?

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:57.161
- Guys, come here!
What happened?

01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:58.787
Daddy, lay down, okay?

01:21:58.955 --> 01:22:00.289
Did he fall?
You'll be fine.

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:03.334
You guys, did anybody
see what happened?

01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:06.003
Over there. Just go get it.
- Okay.

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:10.674
Hey, hey. I had no idea
it'd be such a madhouse.

01:22:10.842 --> 01:22:12.134
Hey. Great party.

01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:14.678
Thanks. Did any guys hit on you?
A lot of them here.

01:22:14.846 --> 01:22:17.473
You need me to evaluate
any level of interest?

01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:20.893
They were gay. Even I know
their level of interest was probably low.

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:22.102
Hey, Skilo!

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:25.481
It's too bad Bill couldn't make it.
I know you guys would hit it off.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:27.024
Okay, right. "Bill. "

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:29.193
Right.

01:22:33.406 --> 01:22:37.785
Listen, I gotta go make a liquor run,
but the food needs some refreshing.

01:22:38.536 --> 01:22:41.205
- Would you mind helping and refilling...?
- Like co-hosting?

01:22:42.582 --> 01:22:44.708
Okay, yeah.

01:22:44.876 --> 01:22:45.918
Sure.

01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:48.420
Just refilling the chips.
They're on the fridge.

01:22:48.588 --> 01:22:49.713
Thanks.

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:56.387
Hey, sweetie, get me a beer?
- I'll get you another.

01:22:56.554 --> 01:22:59.014
- Hi, guys.
- Nice.

01:22:59.182 --> 01:23:01.183
Hey, Linda.

01:23:16.908 --> 01:23:19.201
- Really great party.
- Oh, thanks.

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:23.747
You know, when Alex said he wanted
to throw a party, I was like, "Let's do it!"

01:23:23.915 --> 01:23:26.709
- Thanks for having us.
- No problem, any time.

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:28.919
Can I help you find something?

01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:31.171
Oh, no, it's okay. I got it.

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:32.756
Thanks for mixing that up.

01:23:33.591 --> 01:23:34.675
What?

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:38.512
Alex asked me to get the dip together.
Thanks for getting it started.

01:23:39.764 --> 01:23:41.557
It could use a little more dill.

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:43.434
I'm on it, though, don't worry.

01:23:47.605 --> 01:23:49.356
Come on, my boy. Take it home.

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:51.358
Franchise player. My boy Marbury.

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:53.152
Fifteen seconds.
Let's go.

01:23:53.319 --> 01:23:55.612
Oh, a pass.
You work too hard.

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:59.116
Well, I think I've rounded up
the last of the beer bottles.

01:24:00.577 --> 01:24:03.579
- Oh, what game are we playing?
- Oh, sorry, Nash.

01:24:03.747 --> 01:24:05.956
- Oh, come on.
- Come on, come on.

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:09.793
Nash, you piece of shit. Come on.
- Maybe I should just...

01:24:09.961 --> 01:24:11.670
- It's past 3, so...
Okay, swat it.

01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:13.297
Watch this. Ready?

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:15.007
- And...
Oh, no, no, no!

01:24:15.175 --> 01:24:18.385
Yes. Suck it. Yes.

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:20.471
Oh, you are... You're sensational.

01:24:20.638 --> 01:24:21.722
- Yeah, I know.
- Jesus.

01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:23.974
I don't know why I bother.

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:26.143
- Did you say it's past 3?
- Yeah.

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:29.605
- Oh, man, I gotta go. Hey, good game.
- All right.

01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:31.815
Bye.
Bye.

01:24:54.798 --> 01:24:57.883
Hey, thanks for staying
and helping me clean up.

01:24:58.843 --> 01:25:01.011
I really gotta go to bed, though.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:02.679
Is that an invitation?

01:25:03.556 --> 01:25:04.598
What?

01:25:06.017 --> 01:25:08.185
Oh, God, that was cheesy.

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:11.105
Oh, I'm not good at this.

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:12.689
What?

01:25:21.699 --> 01:25:22.991
Hey.

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:25.577
Oh, yes. I knew it.

01:25:25.745 --> 01:25:28.831
The best relationships
grow out of friendships.

01:25:28.998 --> 01:25:31.041
Wait, wait, wait. Gigi.

01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:33.877
Wait, wait, wait.

01:25:34.045 --> 01:25:35.379
What?

01:25:35.547 --> 01:25:37.381
Now you and I are in a relationship?

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:41.426
Well, I'd say if we're not
at relationship station-ship...

01:25:41.594 --> 01:25:43.053
...we're at least on the track.

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:47.474
And why exactly would you think that?

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:49.393
Because of the signs.

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:51.353
Really, like what?

01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:54.731
Like, it was good to hear from me...

01:25:54.899 --> 01:25:58.277
...and you talked to me
even when you were with a girl...

01:25:58.444 --> 01:26:01.155
...and I felt something.

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:03.615
Oh, man.

01:26:03.783 --> 01:26:05.075
What are you talking about?

01:26:05.243 --> 01:26:08.537
Gigi, what have I been saying
since I met you?

01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:12.374
If a guy wants to date you, he will make
it happen, okay? He will ask you out.

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:13.750
Did I ask you out?

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:16.086
No.

01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:18.797
Why would you do this?

01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:21.091
Oh, shit.

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:23.927
Why do women do this?
Build up this stuff in their minds...

01:26:24.095 --> 01:26:27.973
...take each little thing a guy does,
and then twist it into something else?

01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:29.850
It's insane.

01:26:40.236 --> 01:26:43.280
I'd rather be like that than be like you.

01:26:45.408 --> 01:26:46.617
Excuse me?

01:26:46.784 --> 01:26:48.785
What is that supposed to mean?

01:26:51.122 --> 01:26:53.832
I may dissect each little thing...

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.085
...and put myself out there too much...

01:26:57.253 --> 01:26:59.588
...but at least that means I still care.

01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:05.636
Oh, you think you've won
because women are expendable to you?

01:27:05.803 --> 01:27:10.140
You may not get hurt
or make an ass of yourself that way...

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:12.976
...but you don't fall in love
that way either.

01:27:13.144 --> 01:27:14.895
You have not won.

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:17.231
You're alone, Alex.

01:27:23.988 --> 01:27:26.323
I may do a lot of stupid shit...

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:30.994
...but I know I'm a lot closer
to finding someone than you are.

01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:41.171
Do you want anything else?

01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:44.841
Yeah, less of the cardboard crap
and more regular people food.

01:27:45.009 --> 01:27:49.596
Well, that cardboard crap
is what we call whole-wheat toast.

01:27:50.014 --> 01:27:53.517
Well, maybe you could just fry me up
a couple of sausage links.

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:56.812
People who have just had a heart attack
are generally not advised...

01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:00.440
...to have animal fat that's been stuffed
into a synthetic casing.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.830
Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer
when you get to the kitchen, okay?

01:28:14.998 --> 01:28:17.833
And a little plate of cold cuts,
if there are any left.

01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:21.545
Hey, would you guys please just turn
that down a bit? Dad's trying to sleep.

01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:23.714
You think he wants
to hang on to this vinyl?

01:28:23.881 --> 01:28:25.882
My collection could use a lot of these.

01:28:26.050 --> 01:28:28.385
Would you just turn it the fuck down?

01:28:31.681 --> 01:28:34.182
Well, we're totally out of toilet paper...

01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:38.979
...and all we have left to eat
is some old jelly and some ramen noodles.

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:43.817
And our new brother would like to co-opt
Dad's property before he's even dead.

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:47.112
Laura, also your husband would
really like another beer...

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:50.407
...to go with his fifth consecutive hour
of the golf network.

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:53.994
Are you okay?

01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:58.165
Don't worry, honey, Dad's gonna be fine.

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:01.418
Do you know who it is?
- No.

01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:04.588
Doesn't matter.

01:29:05.965 --> 01:29:07.424
So are you gonna leave him?

01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:11.595
Gigi, he's my husband.

01:29:11.763 --> 01:29:14.931
He's not some guy
who didn't call me back.

01:29:15.099 --> 01:29:17.017
He did admit it to me.

01:29:17.393 --> 01:29:20.896
He didn't wait to get caught,
which takes courage, you know?

01:29:21.814 --> 01:29:24.191
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:25.609
I didn't mean it.

01:29:25.777 --> 01:29:28.236
I know that Alex wasn't just some guy.

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:30.614
Oh, it's okay.

01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:35.952
It's my fault, you know.

01:29:36.454 --> 01:29:37.537
What?

01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:43.960
Oh, I just think I need to take responsibility
for my share in the whole...

01:29:44.128 --> 01:29:46.713
...mess. You know?

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:49.633
I forced him into getting married.

01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:53.261
- You know, he wasn't ready.
- Janine, this isn't your fault.

01:29:53.429 --> 01:29:56.473
No, it is. It is, I've changed.

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:58.975
I was...

01:30:00.019 --> 01:30:02.145
...fun, you know?

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:04.356
I was fun when we first met.

01:30:04.524 --> 01:30:05.649
You're still fun.

01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:15.826
We don't have sex anymore.

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:23.417
Lots of couples go through lulls.

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:25.085
No, I mean...

01:30:27.505 --> 01:30:30.382
...we never have sex.

01:30:38.307 --> 01:30:41.351
I mean, realistically,
what do I expect him to do, you know?

01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:43.812
I don't think that's really...

01:30:45.565 --> 01:30:48.191
God, this tile is too small.

01:30:48.359 --> 01:30:50.318
I have to tell Javier.

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:53.947
- What?
- This tile is too small.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:58.076
I gotta go. I have to take a personal day,
if anyone asks.

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:09.713
Well, my first husband was unimpressive.

01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:12.674
I found him in bed
with his big-breasted secretary...

01:31:12.842 --> 01:31:15.051
...when I came home early
from the Maldives.

01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:18.096
It was just so unoriginal.

01:31:18.264 --> 01:31:20.640
Made me feel sorry for him.

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:24.478
My second husband
was a pinch more creative.

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:26.438
Cheated on me with my sister...

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:31.693
...but made me believe that I was insane
for being suspicious.

01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:35.322
So at least some mind games,
some intrigue.

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:39.117
But my last husband, he was a gem.

01:31:39.285 --> 01:31:42.204
He was a veritable master
at covering his tracks.

01:31:42.371 --> 01:31:47.292
I mean, I pored over his phone records,
I intercepted his credit-card bills...

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.586
...I had him followed
on numerous occasions...

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:53.089
...and never found
a single shred of evidence.

01:31:53.257 --> 01:31:55.634
It wasn't until he died...

01:31:55.801 --> 01:32:01.014
...that I found out about the property
he owned with his Austrian mistress.

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:05.894
But the real master, I have to say, is me.

01:32:06.062 --> 01:32:11.733
Three husbands, countless boyfriends,
I haven't been caught yet.

01:32:12.068 --> 01:32:14.194
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:32:16.447 --> 01:32:19.449
- Oh, my God, oh, my God. I can't...
- Shh.

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:27.123
It's over there.

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:32.379
Oh, my God.

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:34.297
He liked the demo. I can't believe it.

01:32:34.465 --> 01:32:35.549
It's unbelievable.

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:38.426
Did you hear when he said
that it was hauntingly beautiful?

01:32:38.594 --> 01:32:40.595
Yeah, I was there. I was...

01:32:40.763 --> 01:32:42.472
I was there, baby.

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:44.724
Thank you.

01:33:16.799 --> 01:33:20.844
Dana, I'm working. I'm still going over
some offering statements. You gotta...

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:23.888
You gotta come back later.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.683
It's not Dana.

01:33:29.812 --> 01:33:30.854
Is that your...?

01:33:31.856 --> 01:33:33.106
- Is that your...?
- Shh.

01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:35.191
Can you get in the closet?

01:33:36.986 --> 01:33:38.528
- Get in the closet.
- What?

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:41.197
Just go in the closet for a second.
Just for a second.

01:33:41.365 --> 01:33:42.365
Ben?

01:33:45.202 --> 01:33:48.371
I keep telling Dana
to get that damn lock fixed.

01:33:48.998 --> 01:33:51.916
Why do you even bother locking it?
- What?

01:33:52.084 --> 01:33:54.502
Why do you bother locking it?

01:33:55.504 --> 01:33:58.590
Oh, you know I can't get any work done
if I don't.

01:34:06.223 --> 01:34:08.725
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:34:09.352 --> 01:34:11.811
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course.

01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:25.659
What are you doing?

01:34:26.744 --> 01:34:28.328
Sit down.

01:34:28.579 --> 01:34:30.121
Okay.

01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:43.843
Hon?

01:34:48.724 --> 01:34:49.766
What are you doing?

01:34:50.267 --> 01:34:52.435
I don't know. I just thought...

01:34:52.603 --> 01:34:54.229
...maybe we could...

01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:57.315
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

01:34:57.483 --> 01:34:59.484
Maybe if you just go over there.

01:34:59.652 --> 01:35:01.945
Just trying to...

01:35:02.738 --> 01:35:04.572
...you know, re-light the fire.

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:06.908
Oh, honey.

01:35:07.076 --> 01:35:11.287
Didn't you hear what I said before?
I really gotta finish these offerings.

01:35:13.249 --> 01:35:14.874
Look...

01:35:16.419 --> 01:35:18.670
...I'm really trying here.

01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:24.092
Do you wanna save our marriage?

01:35:29.014 --> 01:35:30.932
Of course.

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:33.101
Me too.

01:35:57.293 --> 01:36:01.045
Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in
with the bussers when you can.

01:36:01.213 --> 01:36:03.173
Wait a minute. I'm on 8 through 10.

01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:06.843
Hey, I been working here 18 months,
8 through 10.

01:36:08.053 --> 01:36:10.013
Minor oversight.

01:36:11.682 --> 01:36:14.559
Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then.

01:36:14.727 --> 01:36:18.188
Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago.

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.441
Yeah, he quit.

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:25.695
Is there any reason
we're even having this meeting?

01:36:25.863 --> 01:36:27.030
Not really.

01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:29.199
- No, not for me.
Great. Good. Great.

01:36:29.366 --> 01:36:31.242
Meeting adjourned.

01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:33.203
Back to work.

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:40.043
Hey, Kelli Ann.

01:36:42.213 --> 01:36:43.838
Did I get any calls?

01:36:44.006 --> 01:36:49.344
Since you asked me 11 minutes ago, no.
Not a lot of phone traffic.

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:56.309
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:58.061
What's her name?

01:36:59.939 --> 01:37:01.272
Who?

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:02.857
The girl, Alex.

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:05.652
There's no girl.

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:07.237
You can't hide it, man.

01:37:07.404 --> 01:37:10.824
I know strung out
and you are strung out.

01:37:12.743 --> 01:37:15.286
Okay, please.

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:17.413
This is amazing.

01:37:17.957 --> 01:37:19.749
You can't focus, right?

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:24.170
Jumping every time your phone rings,
checking your e-mail 100 times a day...

01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:26.089
...wishing you could write songs.

01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:30.927
No, feeling the need to bring up her name
in random conversations.

01:37:31.595 --> 01:37:35.431
It's always the same
and it has happened to you, my friend.

01:37:39.228 --> 01:37:40.770
Shit.

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:44.732
Welcome to my world, asshole.

01:37:46.902 --> 01:37:48.653
Let me get the door.

01:37:52.283 --> 01:37:55.159
Sure I can't interest you
in a little beef and broccoli?

01:37:55.327 --> 01:37:57.203
I gotta finish this stuff.

01:37:57.371 --> 01:37:58.788
Okay.

01:38:00.291 --> 01:38:03.209
- Yeah. So I'll see you at home.
- Okay.

01:38:04.169 --> 01:38:05.837
I love you.

01:38:06.338 --> 01:38:08.172
I love you too.

01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:15.263
- Okay. I'll see you later. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:25.315
- You make me sick.
- I had no choice.

01:38:25.482 --> 01:38:28.276
- You're a disgusting excuse for a man!
- What was I supposed to do?

01:38:28.444 --> 01:38:30.653
- You're the one I wanna be...
- Don't touch me!

01:38:30.821 --> 01:38:33.197
You will never touch me again.

01:38:38.370 --> 01:38:40.830
Dino, thanks again for letting me
pay over the phone.

01:38:40.998 --> 01:38:45.043
I assure you this late-payment thing
will never happen again.

01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:47.795
Yep, just trying to trim
some of the drama out of my life.

01:38:49.131 --> 01:38:50.214
Oh, that's my other line.

01:38:50.382 --> 01:38:51.591
Okay, bye.

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:53.801
- Hello?
Hi, Gigi?

01:38:53.969 --> 01:38:55.345
This is Bill.

01:38:55.512 --> 01:38:57.513
- Bill?
- Alex's friend.

01:38:57.681 --> 01:39:01.809
We were supposed to meet up
but Alex told me the wrong day.

01:39:02.519 --> 01:39:04.520
Bill, so you do exist.

01:39:04.688 --> 01:39:06.022
I do.

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:10.234
And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime
if you're still game.

01:39:11.362 --> 01:39:12.612
Yes.

01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:14.906
Sure, why not?

01:39:22.748 --> 01:39:23.998
Hey.

01:39:24.166 --> 01:39:26.250
Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:39:26.418 --> 01:39:28.836
Hi. Hi, sweetie.

01:39:29.254 --> 01:39:31.047
See, why did you
just call me "sweetie"?

01:39:31.215 --> 01:39:34.342
- We always call each other that.
- Why?

01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:37.512
All right, look,
I wanna say something, okay?

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:40.056
We call each other "sweetie"
all the time.

01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:43.017
And we fall asleep on the phone
after talking for hours.

01:39:43.185 --> 01:39:46.562
I washed your hair for you after
you had shoulder surgery and everything.

01:39:46.730 --> 01:39:48.064
And it's like we're together.

01:39:48.232 --> 01:39:50.400
- I know that I've been...
- No, hold on a second.

01:39:50.567 --> 01:39:52.402
Let me finish.

01:39:52.569 --> 01:39:54.404
I think maybe this is my fault...

01:39:54.571 --> 01:39:58.282
...because maybe I wasn't clear
about exactly what I want.

01:39:58.450 --> 01:40:01.077
So let me... Let me be clear.

01:40:01.245 --> 01:40:03.162
I love hanging out.

01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:07.333
But I'm so attracted to you.
I just... I want both.

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:10.253
I don't know what happened
or why we stopped. I don't care.

01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:11.879
Okay.

01:40:13.132 --> 01:40:14.716
- What?
- Okay.

01:40:14.883 --> 01:40:18.094
No, I'm talking about really doing this.
Like a full-on relationship.

01:40:18.262 --> 01:40:19.762
Right.

01:40:19.930 --> 01:40:21.264
With me.

01:40:21.432 --> 01:40:22.807
Yeah.

01:40:24.309 --> 01:40:26.185
A bunch of gay people
put you up to this?

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:28.146
Stop talking.

01:40:47.124 --> 01:40:50.334
Stay home. It's an end-around.
No, no, it's not. He's still got it.

01:40:50.502 --> 01:40:51.961
He's still got it.

01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:54.714
Shit.
- Who let that happen? It's embarrassing.

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:58.676
Argh!
That is so embarrassing.

01:40:59.053 --> 01:41:00.094
What?

01:41:01.346 --> 01:41:03.890
Did any of you guys have a chance
to get to the store?

01:41:04.433 --> 01:41:06.642
Oh, yeah, no.
We're good, we got takeout.

01:41:07.186 --> 01:41:09.395
No, I didn't mean for you, I meant f...

01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:12.523
All right, here we go.
- Come on, defense, wake up.

01:41:14.151 --> 01:41:16.903
You have to be kidding me.

01:41:30.167 --> 01:41:33.503
I just got a little bit more of this
I gotta finish.

01:41:33.670 --> 01:41:35.838
There's some laundry
I'm gonna put away...

01:41:36.006 --> 01:41:38.758
...then I had another load of clothes
in the dryer.

01:41:39.259 --> 01:41:42.512
I did get some of the food your dad likes,
but some healthy stuff too.

01:41:42.679 --> 01:41:44.514
Just, you know.

01:41:47.476 --> 01:41:49.560
It's gonna be okay.

01:41:52.356 --> 01:41:53.481
It'll be okay.

01:43:02.551 --> 01:43:04.677
Bend your knee a little bit more.
There you go.

01:43:04.845 --> 01:43:06.971
Inhale, reverse warrior, look up.

01:43:07.139 --> 01:43:08.264
Exhale.

01:43:19.902 --> 01:43:22.778
Hi, you've reached Ben's cell phone.
Please leave...

01:43:52.434 --> 01:43:55.686
You lying sack of shit!

01:44:01.026 --> 01:44:02.693
Lying!

01:44:02.861 --> 01:44:03.903
Sack!

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:05.655
Shit!

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:46.696
Okay.

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:59.000
- Or call my cell, or try me at work...

01:44:59.167 --> 01:45:02.503
...but definitely leave a message
here first. Thanks.

01:45:02.671 --> 01:45:05.965
Hey, Gigi, it's Alex.

01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:08.342
How's it going?

01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:10.386
Just wondering how you're doing.

01:45:10.554 --> 01:45:14.390
I haven't talked to you in a little while...

01:45:14.558 --> 01:45:16.726
...and was just wondering
how you're doing.

01:45:16.893 --> 01:45:20.563
So, hey, I was hoping to talk to you.

01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:23.566
Obviously.

01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:26.027
But you're out, I guess.

01:45:26.194 --> 01:45:29.905
So just call me sometime.

01:45:30.073 --> 01:45:31.240
Or tonight.

01:45:31.408 --> 01:45:33.993
I'm around, I'll be...
Well, I'm in and around.

01:45:34.703 --> 01:45:37.413
So that's enough for now.

01:45:38.915 --> 01:45:40.624
It's Alex.

01:45:40.792 --> 01:45:42.418
Okay.

01:45:46.048 --> 01:45:47.089
Dude.

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:49.759
I know.

01:46:08.737 --> 01:46:11.655
Hey.

01:46:13.658 --> 01:46:14.950
Welcome aboard.

01:46:15.118 --> 01:46:16.285
Might I come aboard?

01:46:16.453 --> 01:46:18.871
Yeah. You remember the boat.

01:46:19.039 --> 01:46:21.582
Well, you know, I thought I did.

01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:24.168
- Or, you know, little...
- But it's been a while.

01:46:24.336 --> 01:46:28.631
You know that dock? Over there,
there's a boat that looks just like yours.

01:46:28.799 --> 01:46:30.216
Uh-huh.
- It's not yours.

01:46:30.384 --> 01:46:32.760
- No, that's not my boat.
- It's definitely not.

01:46:32.928 --> 01:46:36.347
But there's a very nice gentleman...

01:46:36.515 --> 01:46:37.807
...living on the boat...

01:46:37.974 --> 01:46:41.102
...who invited me in
for a white-wine spritzer.

01:46:41.269 --> 01:46:42.395
Oh, good.

01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:46.565
Wasn't expecting visitors.

01:46:46.733 --> 01:46:50.736
That's all right. I just wanted
to just come by and say thanks...

01:46:50.904 --> 01:46:52.822
...for helping yesterday.

01:46:52.989 --> 01:46:57.034
Beth, you know, I'm the same person.

01:46:57.202 --> 01:46:59.662
I would do anything for you.

01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:02.248
I just can't give you...

01:47:02.416 --> 01:47:04.166
I just can't give you what you want.

01:47:04.334 --> 01:47:06.127
You're what I want.

01:47:06.294 --> 01:47:09.422
Our life together is what I want.

01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:10.673
I miss it.

01:47:10.841 --> 01:47:12.174
I miss you.

01:47:12.342 --> 01:47:14.844
You see those guys my sisters
are married to...

01:47:15.011 --> 01:47:17.596
You're more of a husband to me,
not being married...

01:47:17.764 --> 01:47:21.225
...than those real husbands
are ever gonna be, and...

01:47:21.393 --> 01:47:25.521
It's enough. It's really enough for me.

01:47:27.941 --> 01:47:30.359
And you would be willing...

01:47:30.527 --> 01:47:35.030
...to take the whole marriage thing
off the table completely?

01:47:35.198 --> 01:47:39.160
If you promise to commit to me
and to love me, and...

01:47:39.327 --> 01:47:41.454
- I already have.
- I'm not finished.

01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:43.706
Okay. All right.

01:47:43.874 --> 01:47:47.418
- But I've loved you for seven years...
- Ah-ah.

01:47:47.586 --> 01:47:49.170
Okay.

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:54.216
You have to snake the drain
when my hair gets clogged.

01:47:54.384 --> 01:47:56.385
You know that happens. Okay?

01:47:56.553 --> 01:47:57.970
Okay. Yeah.

01:47:58.138 --> 01:47:59.889
And also...

01:48:02.058 --> 01:48:05.519
...you have to let me eat those Wheat Thins
in bed. You gotta give me that.

01:48:05.687 --> 01:48:07.688
- Okay, fine. All right.
- Okay?

01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:10.649
And...

01:48:11.234 --> 01:48:12.568
- Yeah.
- And?

01:48:12.736 --> 01:48:15.196
- That's it.
- Okay.

01:48:19.075 --> 01:48:20.493
Do I get to come home now?

01:48:21.453 --> 01:48:23.537
I guess you can.

01:48:26.708 --> 01:48:28.918
But these cannot come.

01:48:29.419 --> 01:48:31.003
- What, my pants...?
- That's correct.

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:33.380
- Can't come home? Why?
- No.

01:48:33.548 --> 01:48:36.800
You just won a really big battle,
my friend. Come on.

01:48:38.595 --> 01:48:44.099
So we're not gonna get married,
but I have to get rid of my pants.

01:48:44.267 --> 01:48:47.102
Mm-hm. And we both win.

01:48:47.479 --> 01:48:50.439
All right. I'll get rid of them if you like.

01:48:50.690 --> 01:48:52.608
You're getting
a lot of bids on this place?

01:48:52.776 --> 01:48:56.028
Yeah. I know it's crazy,
but it's a neighborhood in transition.

01:48:56.196 --> 01:48:59.198
Is that like young, hip, gay couples
or something like that?

01:48:59.366 --> 01:49:03.452
Yeah. Hip gay people,
young couples, young families.

01:49:06.456 --> 01:49:07.915
Wow.

01:49:08.583 --> 01:49:11.460
God, this reminds me of where I grew up.

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:14.129
I bet it's got one of the...

01:49:15.131 --> 01:49:17.174
Wait a minute.

01:49:17.634 --> 01:49:19.927
Oh, yeah.

01:49:20.303 --> 01:49:23.389
Yeah, that's it.

01:49:24.641 --> 01:49:26.475
We used to have the exact same one...

01:49:26.643 --> 01:49:29.979
...except my mom used it as a desk.

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:34.024
So...

01:49:34.526 --> 01:49:37.278
...when do all the fabulous people arrive?

01:49:37.445 --> 01:49:39.613
Well, actually,
the open house is tomorrow.

01:49:39.781 --> 01:49:42.032
But I have this one buyer...

01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:45.786
...and I wanted to make sure
his girlfriend likes it first.

01:49:46.329 --> 01:49:48.664
Oh, he has a girlfriend, huh?

01:49:50.208 --> 01:49:52.167
Yeah, I have an idea.

01:49:52.335 --> 01:49:53.586
For this house.

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:54.878
For me.

01:49:55.046 --> 01:49:57.840
And hopefully, if you like it...

01:49:58.008 --> 01:50:00.593
...and things continue to, you know...

01:50:02.178 --> 01:50:03.596
Anna...

01:50:03.763 --> 01:50:05.848
...I have a plan, okay?

01:50:06.016 --> 01:50:08.976
I know where my life is going,
and I want you to go with me.

01:50:09.144 --> 01:50:11.395
I'm not saying I want you
to move in right now...

01:50:11.563 --> 01:50:15.524
...but I don't want to buy this place
unless, at some point...

01:50:15.692 --> 01:50:17.943
...you could see yourself moving in.

01:50:18.528 --> 01:50:20.195
So, what do you think?

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:24.033
I can't do this.

01:50:25.035 --> 01:50:26.660
Okay.

01:50:27.746 --> 01:50:30.706
Well, if it's too fast,
I guess we can always just...

01:50:30.874 --> 01:50:33.125
I can't do any of this.

01:50:33.835 --> 01:50:35.169
I mean...

01:50:35.337 --> 01:50:39.757
...what you're saying
and what you're offering...

01:50:39.924 --> 01:50:43.010
...is what every girl wants.

01:50:43.178 --> 01:50:45.512
It's what I always wanted.

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:47.681
It's just...

01:50:54.439 --> 01:50:55.731
You don't want it with me.

01:51:16.586 --> 01:51:17.586
Okay.

01:51:19.089 --> 01:51:20.923
I have a question.

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:24.635
Is there any way we could...

01:51:25.595 --> 01:51:28.597
...dial it back to before,
when we were just sleeping together...

01:51:28.765 --> 01:51:32.851
...because I don't know,
I felt like that gelled.

01:51:46.783 --> 01:51:48.325
Babe?

01:52:22.986 --> 01:52:24.236
It was nice meeting you.

01:52:24.404 --> 01:52:26.655
Thank you so much for a lovely evening.

01:52:26.823 --> 01:52:28.657
You too.

01:52:34.998 --> 01:52:35.998
Good night.

01:52:55.059 --> 01:52:57.186
You forget something?

01:52:58.146 --> 01:53:00.147
Yeah, I did.

01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:03.192
Really? What did you forget?

01:53:06.863 --> 01:53:08.363
This.

01:53:13.203 --> 01:53:17.664
You came all the way here at 11:00 at night
to bring me back a promotional pen?

01:53:17.832 --> 01:53:18.916
Yeah.

01:53:19.083 --> 01:53:24.421
I thought I should just come up with
some really great excuse to get over here.

01:53:24.589 --> 01:53:26.715
That's how it's done, isn't it?

01:53:28.134 --> 01:53:29.468
Sometimes.

01:53:29.636 --> 01:53:32.221
Look, I can't stop thinking about you.

01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:33.889
It's a problem.

01:53:34.057 --> 01:53:38.268
I drive by your place, I call and hang up.

01:53:38.436 --> 01:53:39.478
I'm turning into...

01:53:39.646 --> 01:53:41.146
Me.

01:53:42.065 --> 01:53:43.732
Yeah.

01:53:46.861 --> 01:53:49.196
A wise person once told me...

01:53:49.364 --> 01:53:54.159
...that if a guy wants to be with a girl
he will make it happen, no matter what.

01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:55.410
That's true.

01:53:55.578 --> 01:53:58.622
But when I was hurling my body
onto yours...

01:53:58.790 --> 01:54:00.916
...you did not seem
to want to make it happen.

01:54:01.084 --> 01:54:04.419
Yeah, all right.
Here's the thing about that:

01:54:04.587 --> 01:54:06.046
You were right.

01:54:06.214 --> 01:54:09.925
I've gotten so used to keeping myself
at a safe distance from all these women...

01:54:10.093 --> 01:54:11.426
...and having the power...

01:54:11.594 --> 01:54:13.762
...that I didn't know what it felt like...

01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:16.098
...when I actually fell...

01:54:16.266 --> 01:54:18.433
...for one of them.

01:54:21.479 --> 01:54:23.438
I didn't know.

01:54:32.490 --> 01:54:34.867
Look, I just went out
with your friend Bill and...

01:54:35.034 --> 01:54:36.118
Yeah.

01:54:36.286 --> 01:54:38.829
He might be just exactly what I need.

01:54:38.997 --> 01:54:40.747
No drama.

01:54:40.915 --> 01:54:43.208
He calls, he does what he says.

01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:45.502
- I can do that stuff too.
- But you didn't.

01:54:45.670 --> 01:54:48.213
And that same wise person told me
that I am the rule.

01:54:48.381 --> 01:54:51.967
That I have to stop thinking
that every guy will change.

01:54:52.135 --> 01:54:54.428
That I have to stop thinking that...

01:55:11.738 --> 01:55:13.488
I'm the exception.

01:55:16.618 --> 01:55:19.161
You are my exception.

01:56:02.538 --> 01:56:03.538
Conor Barry.

01:56:03.706 --> 01:56:06.166
Hi, it's Mary at the Blade.

01:56:06.334 --> 01:56:08.627
I'm looking at your new ad and I love it.

01:56:09.545 --> 01:56:12.130
Really? You don't think the muscle T
is too much?

01:56:12.799 --> 01:56:16.551
I think the shirt you're wearing now
is probably more you.

01:56:18.471 --> 01:56:19.805
What, you here?

01:56:19.973 --> 01:56:22.182
I'm sitting right in front of you.

01:56:23.518 --> 01:56:25.394
Wow, this is you. Mary.

01:56:25.561 --> 01:56:26.645
It's me.

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:28.063
I'm me.

01:56:31.901 --> 01:56:33.235
Should I...?

01:56:33.528 --> 01:56:34.861
- Please. Please.
- Okay.

01:56:35.029 --> 01:56:37.072
- Talk to you in a minute.
- See you in a second.

01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:39.074
Okay.

01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:42.411
Hey.

01:56:42.578 --> 01:56:43.912
- Hi.
- How are you?

01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:45.455
It's nice to finally meet you.

01:56:45.623 --> 01:56:46.707
- You too.
- In person.

01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:49.459
This is a pleasant surprise.

01:56:49.627 --> 01:56:50.877
- You...
- What?

01:56:51.045 --> 01:56:54.172
- I don't know. Not what I expected.
- My voice doesn't match my face?

01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:56.717
Your voice does not match
your face in a good way.

01:56:56.884 --> 01:56:59.928
In a... Yeah, I mean...
That sounded terrible.

01:57:04.559 --> 01:57:06.268
Amazing.

01:57:06.436 --> 01:57:08.770
I don't know how all this stuff
fit in here before.

01:57:08.938 --> 01:57:11.857
I know. It seems like it just expanded.

01:57:20.783 --> 01:57:25.120
You are not trying
to get these back in here.

01:57:25.288 --> 01:57:28.248
- You are not getting rid of these pants.
- We had a deal, mister.

01:57:28.416 --> 01:57:29.791
These are not staying.

01:57:29.959 --> 01:57:34.296
- You can store those horizontally.
- Goodwill wouldn't even take these.

01:57:34.464 --> 01:57:36.923
They could be pressed,
flattened, you can...

01:57:37.091 --> 01:57:40.552
If you're gonna throw them out,
at least check the pockets, all right?

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:44.347
So you don't throw away
some personal items.

01:58:01.616 --> 01:58:04.826
I love you so much.

01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:07.162
So much.

01:58:07.789 --> 01:58:09.998
And I wanna make you happy.

01:58:10.625 --> 01:58:12.542
I need to make you happy...

01:58:12.710 --> 01:58:17.005
...for me to even have a shot
at being happy.

01:58:18.299 --> 01:58:23.512
Will you marry me?

01:58:29.102 --> 01:58:32.687
Yes, of course I will. Yes.

01:58:32.855 --> 01:58:34.439
Yes.

01:58:39.028 --> 01:58:40.862
Thank God.

01:58:44.784 --> 01:58:47.035
Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up:

01:58:47.203 --> 01:58:49.746
If a guy punches you, he likes you.

01:58:49.914 --> 01:58:52.165
Never try to trim your own bangs.

01:58:52.333 --> 01:58:57.295
And someday you will meet a wonderful guy
and get your very own happy ending.

01:58:57.463 --> 01:58:59.131
- And your commitment to each other.

01:59:00.716 --> 01:59:04.052
Every movie we see,
every story we're told...

01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:05.887
...implores us to wait for it.

01:59:06.722 --> 01:59:12.561
The third act twist:
The unexpected declaration of love.

01:59:13.521 --> 01:59:15.647
The exception to the rule.

01:59:15.815 --> 01:59:19.401
But sometimes we're so focused
on finding our happy ending...

01:59:19.569 --> 01:59:22.237
...we don't learn how to read the signs.

01:59:22.405 --> 01:59:25.365
How to tell the ones who want us
from the ones who don't.

01:59:25.533 --> 01:59:28.827
The ones who will stay
from the ones who will leave.

01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:39.254
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:59:39.797 --> 01:59:44.176
And maybe this happy ending
doesn't include a wonderful guy.

01:59:45.511 --> 01:59:48.513
Maybe it's you...

01:59:50.057 --> 01:59:51.933
...on your own...

01:59:52.101 --> 01:59:55.187
...picking up the pieces and starting over.

01:59:56.522 --> 02:00:00.483
Freeing yourself up
for something better in the future.

02:00:02.278 --> 02:00:05.197
Maybe the happy ending is just...

02:00:05.781 --> 02:00:07.699
...moving on.

02:00:11.495 --> 02:00:14.956
Baby, what are you doing? It's our turn.
Forget the dip. Come on, come on.

02:00:15.124 --> 02:00:17.167
Let's go, Alex.

02:00:17.335 --> 02:00:18.960
Come on, Alex, your turn.

02:00:19.128 --> 02:00:20.378
Ready? LOL.

02:00:20.546 --> 02:00:22.923
Laugh out loud! We won!

02:00:23.090 --> 02:00:24.966
Or maybe the happy ending is this:

02:00:25.134 --> 02:00:28.970
Knowing that through all the unreturned
phone calls and broken hearts...

02:00:29.138 --> 02:00:32.641
...through all the blunders
and misread signals...

02:00:32.808 --> 02:00:35.810
...through all of the pain
and embarrassment...

02:00:35.978 --> 02:00:39.814
...you never, ever gave up hope.

02:00:47.073 --> 02:00:48.657
Now that we are married...

02:00:48.824 --> 02:00:50.075
We're gonna move.

02:00:50.243 --> 02:00:52.202
Gonna move.
That's one thing we're gonna do.

02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:56.373
Another thing we're gonna do
is move a little further away from...

02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:59.334
- Baltimore?
- Your sisters.

02:01:00.002 --> 02:01:01.878
I mean, everyone makes mistakes.

02:01:02.046 --> 02:01:07.050
I've started trying to figure out what
I wanna do, who I wanna be, you know?

02:01:07.218 --> 02:01:10.845
Probably seems the wrong time to do that,
but why not? You know, why not?

02:01:11.013 --> 02:01:12.347
Better later than never.

02:01:12.515 --> 02:01:14.224
I'm dating now.

02:01:16.519 --> 02:01:19.145
What do you miss most about marriage?

02:01:19.313 --> 02:01:20.772
Have you been married?

02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:22.023
Yes, I'm married.

02:01:22.191 --> 02:01:23.817
- You are married?
I am married.

02:01:23.985 --> 02:01:25.819
And what's your question?

02:01:25.987 --> 02:01:29.823
We're heading there, is that fair?
It's moving fast. Just on our way.

02:01:29.991 --> 02:01:32.742
I like him, I'll say that L word.

02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:35.870
That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah.

02:01:36.038 --> 02:01:39.207
- I like her a lot, so...
- Good, I'm glad.

02:01:39.375 --> 02:01:41.209
I love her. I love her.

02:01:41.877 --> 02:01:44.379
You know, what I've been focusing
my energy on...

02:01:44.547 --> 02:01:48.383
...is like a self-discovery,
as opposed to dating.

02:01:48.551 --> 02:01:50.969
I don't know.
Maybe dating's a little overrated.

02:01:51.137 --> 02:01:55.890
Good friend of mine and I
are going to India for a few months.

02:01:56.058 --> 02:01:57.475
We're going on a yoga retreat.

02:01:57.643 --> 02:01:59.894
I really genuinely love this person...

02:02:00.062 --> 02:02:01.938
He had asked me to co-host this party...

02:02:02.106 --> 02:02:03.356
...and I stayed after.

02:02:03.524 --> 02:02:07.235
I was trying to help you out because there
was this girl who would not leave...

02:02:07.403 --> 02:02:10.113
...that tall girl.
- Right. She was gross.

02:02:10.281 --> 02:02:11.656
I was trying to...

02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:13.658
She was... come on.

02:02:14.305 --> 02:02:20.929
