BATTLE OF THE EXES

00:08.530 --> 00:10.950
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

00:12.285 --> 00:16.373
Coach, you know how Sam
is always complaining

00:16.540 --> 00:19.252
that I'm not spontaneous?

00:19.419 --> 00:23.549
Yeah, he always goes,
"Can't you be more spontaneous?"

00:23.716 --> 00:26.303
At any rate,
it really irritates me.

00:26.470 --> 00:29.265
Me, too.
Especially when he does that.

00:30.558 --> 00:34.563
Coach, Sam doesn't do that.
You do that.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.650
That doesn't make it any less irritating.

00:37.817 --> 00:43.866
Today, I'm going to do something
unequivocally spontaneous.

00:44.033 --> 00:47.913
- May I have the phone, please?
- Spontaneous phone.

00:48.956 --> 00:52.377
A classmate
in my Samoan literature class

00:52.544 --> 00:56.299
told me about a 200-year-old country inn

00:56.466 --> 01:01.472
on an island off Maine
that you have to be ferried to.

01:01.639 --> 01:08.231
By the time the weekend is over,
he'll think of the Pequod as our place.

01:10.483 --> 01:13.320
Yes. I'd like a room for Malone.

01:14.780 --> 01:17.951
Yes, that's right. Sam Malone.

01:22.122 --> 01:24.626
His usuaI room?

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074

02:41.639 --> 02:43.558
If you're looking for a place,

02:43.725 --> 02:47.730
there's a lovely inn in Vermont
I used to drive to.

02:47.897 --> 02:51.735
- What inn?
- In my station wagon.

02:54.363 --> 03:00.579
Vera and I once went to a beautifuI place
called the Fairview in New Hampshire.

03:00.746 --> 03:05.961
Really romantic. They don't have
any telephones or televisions.

03:06.128 --> 03:10.550
They just have these old fireplaces
and romantic old feather beds,

03:10.717 --> 03:14.305
antiques, so you have to snuggle up
to your loved one.

03:16.307 --> 03:21.022
Best part for me was they had this
old romantic circular driveway.

03:21.189 --> 03:26.153
I didn't have to stop.
I just yelled, "CanceI Peterson. "

03:29.032 --> 03:31.660
- Hey, everybody.
- Oh, Sam.

03:31.826 --> 03:38.126
How would you like to go away with me
this weekend to a country inn?

03:38.293 --> 03:41.756
- What inn?
- You can use my station wagon.

03:43.967 --> 03:46.637
- Excuse me?
- It's a long story.

03:46.804 --> 03:48.932
I haven't decided where we'll stay

03:49.099 --> 03:54.105
but I'll pick a place you've never been
and we'II leave tonight.

03:54.272 --> 03:57.985
Listen up. I am in the worst mood
of my entire life.

03:58.151 --> 04:03.742
So don't bug me and stay out of my way.
This is the only warning you'll get.

04:03.909 --> 04:07.371
Come on.
Turn that frown upside down.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.216
Come on. Easy.

04:22.181 --> 04:24.727
Norman, are you all right?

04:24.893 --> 04:27.772
I'm just glad I could be here for her.

04:28.898 --> 04:31.527
Something's really bothering Carla.

04:32.903 --> 04:35.324
The man knows women.

04:36.450 --> 04:40.913
Listen. Maybe one of us
should go in there and talk to her.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.585
I'm thinking of a number
between one and ten.

04:44.752 --> 04:48.840
Stop showing off.
We got a reaI problem here.

04:50.133 --> 04:52.678
Coach, I'll go in and talk to her.

04:52.845 --> 04:58.770
I don't want to be disturbed.
If I get any calls, just take a message.

05:09.574 --> 05:12.161
Hello. I'm Dr PauI Kendall.

05:12.328 --> 05:17.501
I'm a licensed psychotherapist
specialising in crisis behaviour.

05:17.668 --> 05:19.712
I can help that woman.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.842
Excuse me.

05:25.804 --> 05:30.601
Hello, Carla. My name is Dr PauI
Kendall. I'm a licensed psychotherapist.

05:34.940 --> 05:37.735
Hey. You all right?

05:37.902 --> 05:41.907
I never saw her coming.
I think she dropped from the ceiling.

05:42.074 --> 05:46.371
- Sit down. We'll buy you a drink.
- OK, that's it. I'll take over.

05:46.538 --> 05:50.000
- Coach, maybe...
- I'll do it. Let me do it, Sam.

05:50.167 --> 05:54.172
Listen. I know Carla
like the back of my hand.

05:54.339 --> 05:56.591
What the hell is that?

05:58.135 --> 06:00.346
I never noticed that before.

06:00.513 --> 06:04.101
Coach, maybe you ought
to let her cooI down.

06:04.268 --> 06:07.230
What's this on the back of my hand?

06:08.983 --> 06:15.866
I think that Carla very likely
has the kind of problem

06:16.032 --> 06:19.161
with which only
another woman can help.

06:23.041 --> 06:27.589
Carla, this is Diane. There really
is such a thing as sisterhood.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.800
Come on in.

06:31.970 --> 06:35.223
We women stand together.

06:35.390 --> 06:39.563
I think even leaders of nations
could learn a great deaI

06:39.730 --> 06:42.774
by observing the women of America...

06:47.740 --> 06:51.286
Look. You claim
you know answers to everything.

06:51.453 --> 06:55.499
I am going to give you a chance
to handle my problem.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.335
I give you 30 seconds.

06:57.501 --> 07:01.590
If you blow it, I send you out
and your face stays here.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.803
Fair enough.

07:07.765 --> 07:12.479
My ex-husband is getting remarried
tonight. Here's the invite.

07:15.274 --> 07:19.404
How terrible for you.
I understand completely.

07:19.571 --> 07:21.740
You've never stopped loving him.

07:23.368 --> 07:27.039
I can see this invitation
is soaked with your tears.

07:28.082 --> 07:30.125
That's my spit.

07:35.007 --> 07:38.762
I don't love that rat and I never did.

07:38.929 --> 07:41.974
Sure, there were little things
I loved about him,

07:42.141 --> 07:45.186
like the way he flexed his tattoo.

07:46.605 --> 07:50.068
The way the hair grew in his ears.

07:50.235 --> 07:52.278
The way he drooled in bed.

07:54.782 --> 07:59.037
Carla, are you sure
there's nothing left between you?

08:00.330 --> 08:06.380
Nothing. I'm just ticked
because he's marrying a dish

08:06.547 --> 08:08.590
and rubbing my nose in it.

08:08.757 --> 08:12.554
He even sent a picture of her.
Get a load of that.

08:13.681 --> 08:15.724
She's naked.

08:17.394 --> 08:19.438
So? So was he.

08:22.316 --> 08:25.779
I thought
he was wearing mohair pyjamas.

08:32.078 --> 08:37.376
He's got this foxy new broad
and I can't get a date for his wedding.

08:37.544 --> 08:40.380
I thought you were seeing someone.

08:40.548 --> 08:43.759
His fingerprints grew back.
He left.

08:43.926 --> 08:46.972
Well, then, take someone else.

08:47.139 --> 08:49.184
If you want to play this game with Nick,

08:49.350 --> 08:52.980
take somebody
and pretend he's your fella.

08:53.147 --> 08:55.441
Someone who'll make Nick jealous.

08:57.903 --> 09:03.868
That's good. Someone tall,
handsome, a hunk.

09:04.036 --> 09:07.789
- Maybe Sam...
- Great idea. I'm saved!

09:07.957 --> 09:12.671
...knows somebody.
Maybe Sam knows somebody.

09:12.838 --> 09:15.842
- Diane had a great idea.
- No, I didn't.

09:16.009 --> 09:20.431
Don't be modest.
Nick is getting remarried tonight.

09:20.598 --> 09:23.017
So that's what this is all about.

09:23.184 --> 09:27.022
Diane said you should be my date
for the wedding tonight

09:27.189 --> 09:29.525
to show Nick I'm better than him.

09:29.692 --> 09:31.612
I didn't. It's a lunatic idea.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.823
Honey, listen.
I'm going away for the weekend.

09:34.990 --> 09:37.702
Pick somebody else here.

09:37.869 --> 09:41.123
You're the best-looking guy in this bar.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.503
- Best-looking guy in the city.
- In the state.

09:44.670 --> 09:49.300
He's not. There's a great-looking guy
who used to drink here.

09:49.467 --> 09:54.473
- I think his name was Clifford Clavin.
- Hey. I'm... Clifford Clavin.

09:54.641 --> 09:58.311
Oh, my God.
What did you do to yourself?

10:00.982 --> 10:05.404
- He used to look like Tyrone Power.
- I've lost my looks?

10:05.570 --> 10:10.494
I think you're thinking of Cliff Clemens.
You've never looked better than this.

10:10.661 --> 10:12.705
That's a relief. Thank you, Norm.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.836
Hello, Carla!

10:20.589 --> 10:24.469
Oh, my God. It's Nick.
I'll be with you in a minute.

10:24.636 --> 10:26.723
What do you say? Please?

10:26.889 --> 10:29.977
- Please?
- Carla, Carla.

10:30.144 --> 10:32.646
It would be a transparent charade.

10:32.813 --> 10:37.903
Come on. I know how you and Nick are.
I don't wanna get in the middle.

10:39.196 --> 10:41.575
Thanks a lot.

10:48.082 --> 10:50.753
Nick, what are you doing here?

10:50.919 --> 10:55.550
I thought you wouldn't come to the
wedding. I want you to meet my fiancÃ©e.

10:55.717 --> 10:57.803
Loretta.

10:57.970 --> 11:02.184
And see for yourself that the photos
were not re-touched.

11:05.897 --> 11:08.441
More than I can say for Loretta.

11:09.526 --> 11:11.528
Watch your mouth.

11:11.695 --> 11:16.994
Loretta, this is Carla,
who I divorced for obvious reasons.

11:19.413 --> 11:22.501
Look, Nick. I'm going to make your day.

11:22.667 --> 11:25.296
You're right.
I am not coming to your wedding.

11:25.463 --> 11:30.594
- No! I'm aghast!
- You knew it the whole time.

11:30.761 --> 11:33.890
You don't want people
whispering at the ceremony.

11:34.057 --> 11:36.310
"Look how much better
Nick did this time. "

11:36.477 --> 11:40.649
Carla, honey, are you sure
you won't change your mind?

11:40.815 --> 11:42.859
We'll have a lot of fun at this wedding.

11:43.026 --> 11:45.905
What about the weekend in the country?

11:46.072 --> 11:51.829
Well, you two can go away after the
ceremony. This wedding's speciaI.

11:51.996 --> 11:53.748
What do you say?

11:53.915 --> 11:59.463
Wait, wait, wait.
You and Sam, you're a couple?

11:59.631 --> 12:03.552
She put up quite a fight
but I finally got her.

12:04.929 --> 12:06.973
Sam, I thought you was cooI.

12:10.686 --> 12:14.732
That's us, honey.
The cabbie's tired of waiting.

12:14.899 --> 12:16.944
I don't want to make him angry.

12:17.945 --> 12:21.074
- See you at the wedding.
- We'll be there.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.244
This is eerie.

12:25.621 --> 12:29.334
Thank you, Sam.
You sure this is OK with you, Diane?

12:29.501 --> 12:34.925
Certainly. Really stirred my ire
just watching that baitbucket.

12:36.260 --> 12:40.432
I know. He still has it, doesn't he?

12:52.920 --> 12:56.425
Thank you, guys,
for hanging around here.

12:56.591 --> 13:01.097
I get nervous when Sam's not here
and I have to cash out myself.

13:01.264 --> 13:02.599
You came close.

13:02.766 --> 13:07.689
- How close?
- You were only off $16,000.

13:07.856 --> 13:10.818
I never had an accounting course
in my life.

13:10.985 --> 13:13.989
- You've got a flair for it.
- Thanks, Normie.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.492
Coach, I'm going home to pack.

13:17.660 --> 13:21.164
When Sam gets back,
will you tell him something?

13:21.330 --> 13:23.375
Sure, honey. Goodnight.

13:25.587 --> 13:29.967
- I didn't tell you what to tell him.
- I'll think of something.

13:30.134 --> 13:34.598
Tell him I'll be back as soon as
I'm packed and we'II leave on our trip.

13:34.765 --> 13:37.185
- We'll tell him.
- Goodnight.

13:38.311 --> 13:40.521
So I'm not a pretty boy.

13:44.735 --> 13:48.448
My father wasn't pretty either.
He's a beautifuI man now.

13:48.615 --> 13:54.664
Know what I'm talking about?
I mean, beautifuI inside.

13:54.831 --> 13:57.668
If you could have seen his insides...

13:57.835 --> 13:59.921
When he has an operation, let me know.

14:03.300 --> 14:07.472
- Hey, how was the wedding?
- Oh, it was so great.

14:07.639 --> 14:13.647
Normie, if there is such a thing
as perfect, this was it.

14:13.814 --> 14:19.529
Sam kept putting his arm around me,
hugging me, whispering in my ear.

14:19.695 --> 14:23.826
- Did Nick notice?
- Notice? He threw the ring at us

14:23.993 --> 14:26.329
and yelled, "Pay attention!"

14:28.707 --> 14:32.170
So, Coach. How did we do tonight?

14:32.337 --> 14:35.633
The totaI's a little off, Sam, you know.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.843
Twenty, thirty thousand?

14:38.970 --> 14:40.847
Sixteen.

14:41.932 --> 14:45.812
Way to go, guy.
You're bucking for promotion here.

14:45.979 --> 14:48.065
If it happens, it happens.

14:48.232 --> 14:50.901
- Goodnight, all.
- Goodnight, Coach.

14:51.068 --> 14:54.322
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Coach. Where's Diane?

14:54.489 --> 14:58.954
- She's packing. She'll be back shortly.
- Thanks.

14:59.121 --> 15:02.666
Cliff, you've had a lot to drink.
I'll drive you home.

15:02.833 --> 15:07.423
That's great of you. You're a reaI friend.
A paI when you need one.

15:07.590 --> 15:13.054
If I have kids, I'll name them after you.
Even if they're girls.

15:13.221 --> 15:15.266
Please. It's just a ride home.

15:15.433 --> 15:19.146
Yeah, but I'm going
to throw up in your car.

15:21.231 --> 15:23.359
- Coffee, Carla?
- Yeah. Thanks.

15:23.526 --> 15:27.948
You were the greatest tonight.
Thanks for putting up with that.

15:28.198 --> 15:30.075
I had a terrific time.

15:30.243 --> 15:32.287
Someone should have told Nick.

15:32.454 --> 15:36.042
He went through the ceremony
with his fly open.

15:36.208 --> 15:40.297
He knew. It's a tradition in his family.
Sign of fertility.

15:42.258 --> 15:46.305
Didn't you notice his father
and all the ushers?

15:46.472 --> 15:49.350
That's right. Well, that explains it.

15:49.516 --> 15:54.065
I thought it was because the building
was stuffy. I thought about it myself.

15:55.983 --> 15:58.653
- You know something, Carla?
- What?

15:58.820 --> 16:02.033
- You surprised me tonight.
- Why?

16:02.200 --> 16:05.371
I never realised
how much you know about me.

16:05.537 --> 16:09.584
You know more stories about my career
than I do.

16:09.751 --> 16:12.545
I had to make it look like the reaI thing.

16:12.712 --> 16:15.800
- I know everything about you.
- Yeah, right.

16:15.966 --> 16:18.136
Your favourite colour is blue.

16:18.303 --> 16:21.682
Your hobby is sailing,
favourite food is Chinese.

16:21.849 --> 16:25.187
Your taste in women
is not what it used to be.

16:25.354 --> 16:28.107
Right across the board.
You do know me.

16:28.273 --> 16:30.902
- Better than you know me.
- Oh, yeah?

16:31.069 --> 16:34.156
Your favourite meaI
is Chicken McNuggets.

16:34.323 --> 16:39.788
Your favourite hobby is drawing
underarm hair on the models in "Vogue".

16:45.879 --> 16:49.467
And your favourite movie
is "Lady And The Tramp".

16:49.634 --> 16:52.972
And you always cry
when they eat the spaghetti.

16:53.139 --> 16:55.891
I didn't think anybody knew that.

16:57.602 --> 17:00.815
I'll tell you something else
you didn't think I knew.

17:00.982 --> 17:04.069
- You go to Mass every Sunday.
- Who squealed?

17:04.236 --> 17:07.906
I was guessing.
Shows how well I know you.

17:08.074 --> 17:11.368
This is soppy.
Let's talk about something else.

17:11.536 --> 17:13.539
Baseball?

17:14.874 --> 17:19.422
- We're gonna miss the bus.
- Keep your pants on.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.300
We've got forever together.

17:25.262 --> 17:30.476
You know, the way you were carrying on
at my wedding, all lovey-dovey...

17:30.643 --> 17:33.397
How long has this been going on?

17:33.564 --> 17:37.152
- What's it to you?
- Answer the question.

17:37.319 --> 17:41.198
You been seeing him
while we were married?

17:41.365 --> 17:46.496
No. I was always faithfuI to you.
Were you seeing Loretta?

17:46.663 --> 17:48.666
What am I, on triaI here?

17:50.418 --> 17:55.425
If you were seeing him when we were
married, our marriage was a lie.

17:55.592 --> 17:59.096
You know, she's taken
enough abuse from you.

17:59.263 --> 18:02.476
Knock it off
or I'll teach you some manners.

18:02.643 --> 18:05.395
This'll be great. Nick's a bleeder.

18:06.981 --> 18:08.983
I want to talk to you.

18:09.150 --> 18:11.570
- What about?
- It's private.

18:11.737 --> 18:14.157
- Go on.
- All right.

18:16.451 --> 18:18.496
Make it quick.

18:21.123 --> 18:23.418
I want you back.

18:26.506 --> 18:32.054
Nick, you just got married.
Your bride is standing over there.

18:32.221 --> 18:36.226
I'II lose her in the bus station.
That's where I found her.

18:39.522 --> 18:43.902
Are you nuts? You've still got wedding
cake in your mouth.

18:44.069 --> 18:46.114
I don't know what it is.

18:46.280 --> 18:51.578
Every time I look at you today,
I say to myself, "Carla's not so bad. "

18:51.745 --> 18:56.543
Maybe I was making a mistake.
I don't know what it is.

18:57.628 --> 18:59.672
What do you say, Carla?

19:02.509 --> 19:06.973
I know what it is.
You saw me with Sam today.

19:07.140 --> 19:11.770
You saw that somebody else wanted me
so you wanted me back.

19:11.937 --> 19:15.483
Forget it. I wouldn't
make the same mistake twice.

19:15.650 --> 19:19.155
Sure. I'll forget it, if you forget this.

19:22.117 --> 19:27.623
- So how's married life treating you?
- I don't feeI so different.

19:32.213 --> 19:36.427
So?
What do you say, Carla?

19:38.721 --> 19:45.229
Nothing, Nick. The magic is gone.
I got myself a better guy.

19:45.396 --> 19:49.693
Well, I took a shot.
Loretta, you're up!

19:49.860 --> 19:55.784
I don't appreciate you coming to the
wedding in the dress you married me in.

19:55.951 --> 19:58.579
Boy, am I primed for this honeymoon.

20:09.009 --> 20:12.639
So, come on. What happened?
What did he say?

20:13.932 --> 20:18.604
He crawled to me, Sam,
and I stepped on his heart.

20:18.771 --> 20:22.275
All right! That's terrific.
You must feeI great.

20:24.362 --> 20:27.115
Hey, come on.
What's this all about?

20:27.282 --> 20:31.579
Listen, you're on top. He came back
begging and you beat him.

20:31.746 --> 20:34.123
What are you so upset about?

20:35.834 --> 20:37.878
I didn't beat him.

20:38.964 --> 20:41.967
He only wanted me
because he thought you did.

20:43.886 --> 20:46.723
What he has is reaI.

20:46.890 --> 20:52.522
AII I have is a lie. My life is terrible.

20:52.689 --> 20:56.443
Hey, come on, Carla.

21:00.782 --> 21:02.827
Come on.

21:26.148 --> 21:28.191
Well...

21:29.986 --> 21:32.780
You know what that was, don't you?

21:34.116 --> 21:37.704
- No, do you?
- I think so.

21:37.871 --> 21:40.165
Good. What was it?

21:40.331 --> 21:45.172
We've been together all afternoon
and all over each other.

21:45.338 --> 21:48.300
It's just the naturaI thing to do.

21:49.635 --> 21:51.679
That wasn't it.

21:51.846 --> 21:56.101
- Well, what was it?
- It was a pity kiss.

21:56.268 --> 22:00.148
I've gotten them, I've given them.
I know what they are.

22:00.315 --> 22:03.319
- So have I. That wasn't one.
- Then what was it?

22:06.031 --> 22:09.577
Maybe we just wanted to find out
what it would be like.

22:11.454 --> 22:13.499
Maybe.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.711
So what was it like?

22:19.297 --> 22:23.594
- What was it like for you?
- I've had better.

22:26.723 --> 22:29.519
- Well, I haven't.
- I know.

22:33.565 --> 22:35.610
Well...

22:36.569 --> 22:39.239
Whatever it was, it's over now.

22:39.406 --> 22:44.538
Yeah. Ain't gonna let that get in the way
of a good friendship, huh?

23:01.267 --> 23:05.397
If it picks you up any,
I never had a better handshake.

23:09.318 --> 23:11.363
Hi, guys.

23:13.865 --> 23:15.910
Well, what happened?

23:16.077 --> 23:18.998
It was great.
We made a shambles of the wedding.

23:19.164 --> 23:22.294
Diane, I want to thank you.

23:22.460 --> 23:26.089
Sam. Tonight,
the three of us joined together

23:26.257 --> 23:31.221
and were able to make
another human being eat his liver.

23:32.389 --> 23:34.434
Life, I love you!

23:36.144 --> 23:38.188
Goodnight.

23:39.648 --> 23:44.821
- I'm ready for our weekend.
- You're sure you've got everything?

23:44.988 --> 23:47.616
I believe in being prepared.

23:47.783 --> 23:50.829
With all this luggage,
I hope you didn't forget

23:50.996 --> 23:54.250
the frilly baby doll nightie I love so much.

23:54.417 --> 23:57.588
I'm sorry, Sam. It's at the cleaners.

23:57.755 --> 24:00.424
Couldn't you wear something else?

24:01.968 --> 24:04.012
Just this once.

24:04.179 --> 24:07.892
OK, but if I don't like it,
we come right home.

24:44.145 --> 24:45.147
