00:02.079 --> 00:02.980
GRACE:Â  Previously on  The Secret
Life of the American Teenager...

00:03.047 --> 00:05.049
We heard the good news! You got married!

00:05.116 --> 00:06.917
Hey, how are you? I heard
you were in the hospital.

00:06.984 --> 00:08.986
If you had cared how I am,

00:09.053 --> 00:11.155
you would have called me to tell
me that you got married yourself.

00:11.222 --> 00:13.924
This year, I'm asking
each of the seniors

00:13.991 --> 00:15.893
to mentor a freshman
coming into the school.

00:15.960 --> 00:16.927
That's a great idea.

00:16.994 --> 00:18.062
Kathy!

00:18.963 --> 00:19.930
Hey!

00:19.997 --> 00:21.132
KATHY: I don't mind talking to you,

00:21.198 --> 00:22.900
but I don't want to be like you.

00:22.967 --> 00:24.201
There's something else
I need to tell you.

00:25.870 --> 00:26.036
I'm gay.

00:26.103 --> 00:28.806
You have a thing for
young girls, don't you?

00:28.873 --> 00:29.140
Look, pal, you just
stepped over the line.

00:29.206 --> 00:31.976
I love you!

00:32.042 --> 00:33.177
I've always loved you!

00:34.912 --> 00:35.813
Pappas is our Tebow!

00:35.880 --> 00:37.114
So why should we stay here
if we could be in Italy?

00:37.181 --> 00:39.817
I can't follow you all over the world.

00:39.884 --> 00:43.154
Does your dad know you decided
to go to this cooking school?

00:43.220 --> 00:45.056
What do you think I should do?

00:45.122 --> 00:47.925
I told you, you are on your own.

00:47.992 --> 00:49.994
Does that include all trouble?

00:50.061 --> 00:51.996
You really want to do this?
Let this idiot marry us?

00:52.063 --> 00:53.798
Not really. Thanks!

00:53.864 --> 00:54.865
We changed our mind! Oh, wait.

00:54.932 --> 00:56.133
But wait! I love you.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.968
I love you, too.

01:04.041 --> 01:06.010
What are you talking about?
We can't say we're not married.

01:06.077 --> 01:07.878
We already said we are.

01:07.945 --> 01:09.847
You're kidding me, right?
We can't keep this up.

01:09.914 --> 01:11.982
Just look at the damage
done in less than a week.

01:12.049 --> 01:14.819
We have to stop lying
before this gets any worse.

01:14.885 --> 01:19.023
Don't exaggerate. This is not some kind
of crisis, we're just telling one lie.

01:19.090 --> 01:22.893
Uh, what? It's not one lie. It's a lie
that's leading to another one and another one

01:22.960 --> 01:23.894
and another one, because
it's such a big lie!

01:23.961 --> 01:26.964
Whoa. What are you yelling at me for?

01:27.031 --> 01:28.099
You're as much to
blame for this as I am.

01:28.165 --> 01:31.035
No, I'm not! You're the one who
blurted out, "Oh, we're married!"

01:38.943 --> 01:42.847
Look, Amy, I think we have to get our parents
together tonight when my dad gets home,

01:42.913 --> 01:44.982
all of them, and we have
to tell them the truth.

01:45.049 --> 01:46.817
I can't live like this.
We can't live like this.

01:46.884 --> 01:49.153
Yes, we can. We have to!

01:49.220 --> 01:52.089
We'll just do what my parents
did. We'll say we got married

01:52.156 --> 01:54.825
when we didn't, and then we'll
get married and not say we did.

01:54.892 --> 01:56.127
No, I don't want to do
what your parents did.

01:56.193 --> 01:59.797
I don't want to live a
lie for God knows how long.

01:59.864 --> 02:02.066
It's not even really a lie
when you think about it.

02:02.133 --> 02:05.936
It's just delaying telling the truth.

02:06.003 --> 02:08.939
And I had to lie! My
dad was so proud of us!

02:09.006 --> 02:10.975
So proud of me. He loves me.

02:11.041 --> 02:11.942
He'll still love you if you tell
him we didn't go through with it.

02:14.011 --> 02:15.946
We can elope any time you want.

02:16.013 --> 02:17.815
Run off a second time?

02:17.882 --> 02:20.017
After seeing how everyone feels
about our running off the first time?

02:20.084 --> 02:22.019
Yes. Really, Amy?

02:22.086 --> 02:25.890
Yes! Really! We'll get married and
they don't need to know when or where.

02:25.956 --> 02:28.893
No, because they think we're
married now, and we're not!

02:28.959 --> 02:32.997
And until then, we can't just keep lying.
We're getting into this deeper and deeper.

02:33.064 --> 02:36.801
Calm down, all right?
Don't tell me to calm down.

02:36.867 --> 02:39.904
I hate that. "Calm down." It's not a
good thing to say to me when I'm not calm.

02:39.970 --> 02:41.906
It makes me more not calm.

02:41.972 --> 02:45.176
I'm sorry, but I can't really talk
about this anymore. I have to go.

02:50.047 --> 02:51.048
John!

02:54.952 --> 02:57.054
This conversation isn't over. We haven't
decided what we're going to do yet.

02:57.121 --> 03:01.121
I have. John! Come
on, sweetie. Let's go.

03:02.193 --> 03:04.862
You have to get to the nursery
and Mommy has to get to school.

03:04.929 --> 03:06.063
Okay?

03:07.865 --> 03:08.966
What?

03:09.033 --> 03:11.068
Amy, think about it. We can't do
this. We can't do this to John.

03:11.135 --> 03:14.105
There are a lot of bad
consequences to lying

03:14.171 --> 03:16.874
and teaching our son that it's
okay to lie could be one of them.

03:16.941 --> 03:19.143
Telling the truth can have bad
consequences, too, you know.

03:19.210 --> 03:22.113
Come on, let's just get everything
out in the open and deal with it.

03:22.179 --> 03:24.048
We can just apologize
for lying and just...

03:24.115 --> 03:27.885
Just do what? Go back
to not being married?

03:27.952 --> 03:29.153
I like being married,
being pretend married.

03:29.220 --> 03:33.090
I don't. Okay, but you like me, right?

03:33.157 --> 03:35.059
(CHUCKLES) I like you.

03:35.126 --> 03:39.063
So, just pretend to be married for
right now and then you can decide

03:39.130 --> 03:39.930
where and when we get married next time.

03:44.034 --> 03:44.935
See you later, husband.

03:45.002 --> 03:46.003
See you later, pretend wife.

I got a "dear Dad" letter!
A "dear Dad" letter!

04:37.888 --> 04:38.823
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

04:38.889 --> 04:40.891
So, she left? For Italy?

04:40.958 --> 04:43.994
Like you didn't know? I didn't know!

04:44.061 --> 04:45.129
I texted her and she
didn't text me back.

04:45.196 --> 04:49.033
Oh, really, Anne? Ashley has
enough money to get to Italy,

04:49.100 --> 04:51.068
to live in Italy without anyone's help?

04:51.135 --> 04:53.938
She has a credit card, but I don't think
that it's enough to get her to Italy.

04:54.004 --> 04:55.806
It has a $200 limit.

04:55.873 --> 04:58.142
Then how did she get to Italy! Toby?

04:58.209 --> 05:02.012
Toby, of course, Toby. The two of them
ran off together to have sex in Italy!

05:02.079 --> 05:05.015
If she calls either one of us, we're going
to tell her to get her butt back home!

05:05.082 --> 05:09.082
I don't like the way that she left,
but maybe it's not the worst thing,

05:10.254 --> 05:14.091
at least she's interested in something.
Maybe she'll become a great chef.

05:14.158 --> 05:15.860
She's not interested in cooking.

05:15.926 --> 05:16.894
She's not interested in anything

05:16.961 --> 05:16.994
but getting away from her family

05:17.061 --> 05:19.196
and I think she should be here right now

05:19.263 --> 05:21.031
and I want her home and
I'm going to go get her.

05:21.098 --> 05:23.801
Wait! Open the card that she
addressed to me and read it to me.

05:23.868 --> 05:25.102
Maybe she told me something
she didn't tell you.

05:25.169 --> 05:27.071
She used to tell me
everything, you know,

05:27.138 --> 05:30.074
before you made her love
you more than she loves me.

05:30.141 --> 05:32.977
Well, now she loves Toby more
than she loves either of us,

05:33.043 --> 05:34.945
so open the card and read it to me.

05:35.012 --> 05:38.049
Oh, and by the way, you're responsible
for her getting this bad case of wanderlust

05:38.115 --> 05:42.115
at her young age, letting her drive
cross-country and flying all over Europe with her.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.991
You're the one who took her riding around
in that house on wheels after we split up.

05:47.058 --> 05:48.993
Remember that summer?

05:49.060 --> 05:51.028
That's when she got excited about
getting out and seeing the world.

05:51.095 --> 05:53.964
(SCOFFS) Like it's a bad thing, seeing
the world. Just open the damn card!

05:59.870 --> 06:02.139
"Dear Mom." Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, ha!

06:02.206 --> 06:03.974
Same thing as mine! She
hates goodbyes, wish her well.

06:04.041 --> 06:07.111
Yadda, yadda, yadda. You
know what? I'm going to Italy.

06:07.178 --> 06:09.980
I'm going to Italy. I'm gonna
find her. I'm gonna bring her home

06:10.047 --> 06:12.049
and I'm gonna leave that idiot of a boyfriend
of hers over there to fend for himself.

06:12.116 --> 06:16.153
Toby. That teenage
philanderer. I ought to...

06:16.220 --> 06:18.122
I'm here, sir.

06:19.256 --> 06:20.257
I'll call you back.

06:23.060 --> 06:27.060
She's gone. Our Ashley is gone.

06:29.166 --> 06:32.036
She's not "our Ashley." She's my Ashley
and how the hell did she get the money

06:32.103 --> 06:33.204
to go to Italy on her own?

06:33.270 --> 06:35.906
I don't know. I figured Anne.

06:35.973 --> 06:39.944
It wasn't Anne. Oh.
Well, then, I don't know.

06:40.010 --> 06:40.911
What does your note say?

06:42.880 --> 06:45.049
A lot of stuff, seven pages of stuff.

06:45.116 --> 06:46.884
Let me see it. I can't do that.

06:46.951 --> 06:50.888
And why not? Uh, it's personal.

06:50.955 --> 06:54.091
It talks about, you
know, intimate things.

06:54.158 --> 06:57.128
Oh, geez. She said she
figured I would hate her now.

06:57.194 --> 06:58.195
If I hated her, I wouldn't miss her

06:58.262 --> 07:00.865
and I should hate her.

07:02.166 --> 07:03.901
But I don't.

07:08.038 --> 07:12.143
Oh, God, what am I gonna do
without her? Without Ashley?

07:18.215 --> 07:20.985
What are you doing?

07:21.052 --> 07:22.820
Uh...

07:22.887 --> 07:25.156
I'm letting all the
blood rush to my brain.

07:25.222 --> 07:27.825
I'm hoping it'll help me think more
clearly or that I'll just pass out

07:27.892 --> 07:29.126
and not have to think at all.

07:29.193 --> 07:31.929
Are you on drugs or are you
just acting stupid? Get up.

07:34.031 --> 07:36.834
I'm not on drugs.

07:36.901 --> 07:39.804
And I did actually think
that that would help me focus.

07:39.870 --> 07:42.973
All right, well, you gotta
do what you gotta do. Meaning?

07:43.040 --> 07:45.976
Meaning as long as you're not doing
something crazy because you're on drugs

07:46.043 --> 07:49.880
or drinking or any of that stuff,
then I'm not going to concern myself.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.982
If you need to lie down or
stand on your head or do a jig

07:52.049 --> 07:54.151
to get some focus, go at it.

07:54.218 --> 07:56.821
Did you come in here to tell me that?

07:56.887 --> 07:59.990
No, I came in here to tell you that I was
going out to dinner with Camille tonight

08:00.057 --> 08:03.928
and the conversation took a left
turn when I saw you upside down.

08:03.994 --> 08:06.897
(CHUCKLES) Oh. Okay. Okay.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.900
Did you wanna ask if I
wanted to go with you two?

08:09.967 --> 08:11.068
Do you want to go with the two of us?

08:11.135 --> 08:13.137
I don't know. What time are you going?

08:13.204 --> 08:15.840
What the hell difference does
it make what time we're going?

08:15.906 --> 08:17.975
If you want to go with us, you're welcome
to go with us. If you don't want to go,

08:18.042 --> 08:18.943
you're welcome to get food on your own.

08:19.009 --> 08:22.179
You're a big boy now. You can get
your own dinner if you want to.

08:22.246 --> 08:25.049
Or do you need me to stay here and
make you dinner and feed it to you?

08:25.116 --> 08:27.985
Here comes the plane!

08:28.052 --> 08:31.055
It's your life, Ben. You gotta
man up and get it together.

08:31.122 --> 08:31.989
I told you I wasn't gonna
help you out if you got

08:32.056 --> 08:35.092
into trouble with
this girl, and I'm not.

08:35.159 --> 08:38.028
There's nothing to do.
Dylan's father wants

08:38.095 --> 08:39.096
to just sit back and
wait and see what happens.

08:39.163 --> 08:42.967
And what do you want? What's
to your advantage here?

08:43.033 --> 08:46.070
To sit back and wait or to tell
someone in authority what she did?

08:46.137 --> 08:48.839
It's not what she did. It's
what we did, what I did.

08:48.906 --> 08:50.941
No. What she did. Have
a nice day at school.

08:55.212 --> 08:57.148
Mom, I'm at school. I just got here.

08:57.214 --> 08:59.150
I can't talk. I'll call
you back, all right?

08:59.216 --> 09:02.186
No, not all right. Do you know
that Ashley left for Italy?

09:02.253 --> 09:06.824
No. I knew she was going,
or she said she was going

09:06.891 --> 09:06.924
or she wanted to go or something.

09:06.991 --> 09:09.093
So, you didn't give her the money?

09:09.160 --> 09:12.997
No. Mom, where would I get the money
to give to Ashley to go to Italy?

09:13.064 --> 09:15.066
(CHUCKLES) Don't be
ridiculous. I have to go.

09:15.132 --> 09:17.101
Do not hang up.

09:17.168 --> 09:19.804
I thought maybe you got some money
for your wedding or something.

09:19.870 --> 09:22.973
Like I would give my wedding money
to Ashley to go to Italy? Please.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.975
Hold on. I have another call.

09:25.042 --> 09:28.879
Mom! I'm at school. My classes are
gonna start any minute. I can't hold.

09:28.946 --> 09:30.114
It's Madison and Lauren.
I'll call you back.

09:33.050 --> 09:37.050
Well, we were thinking we'd have a big
party and invite all of Amy's family

09:38.055 --> 09:40.891
and Ricky's family and Amy's
friends and Ricky's friends.

09:40.958 --> 09:43.127
None of the girls that he slept
with, though, nothing like that.

09:43.194 --> 09:46.864
So, you and Lauren want to
give Amy a wedding reception?

09:46.931 --> 09:48.065
Not a wedding reception, really.

09:48.132 --> 09:51.936
Kind of. It's kind of
a wedding reception.

09:52.002 --> 09:54.972
No. I really appreciate the gesture.

09:55.039 --> 09:58.075
It's really very kind of you,
but if anyone is going to have

09:58.142 --> 10:00.845
a wedding reception for my daughter, I
think it should be her mother and her father.

10:00.911 --> 10:04.949
Well, her mother or father haven't said
anything about doing anything, so I just...

10:05.916 --> 10:07.118
I have to go.

10:08.252 --> 10:10.821
No. No wedding reception.

10:10.888 --> 10:13.057
We ran off and got married because I
don't want a wedding or a wedding reception

10:13.124 --> 10:17.124
or a party or a get-together or
a luau or anything else like that.

10:17.962 --> 10:18.896
We eloped so no one has to do anything.

10:18.963 --> 10:22.967
But we want to do something. You're
our best friend. You got married.

10:23.033 --> 10:27.138
We want to celebrate with you. We want
to buy you gifts and take pictures and...

10:27.204 --> 10:30.875
It's Ricky, isn't it? Ricky doesn't
want anything. That's not fair, Amy.

10:30.941 --> 10:32.076
That's not fair to you.

10:32.143 --> 10:35.946
No. It's not because of Ricky. Ricky would
be fine with it. I'm not fine with it.

10:36.013 --> 10:37.815
And I'll tell you what's not fair.

10:37.882 --> 10:41.152
It's not fair to me that you two went
around me to my mother to do this.

10:41.218 --> 10:45.218
Around you? That's not what we
were doing, going around you.

10:45.956 --> 10:48.893
Yeah, you told us she was upset that
she didn't get to go to the wedding,

10:48.959 --> 10:52.063
so, naturally, we thought
we should call her first.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.965
Because she always feels left
out and now that she's gay,

10:55.032 --> 10:58.803
we don't want her to think we're
homophobic or anything because we're not.

10:58.869 --> 11:02.139
It's not a good day to bother my mother
with this. She and my dad just found out

11:02.206 --> 11:03.941
that Ashley ran away to Italy.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

11:06.010 --> 11:07.878
What!

11:07.945 --> 11:10.147
Amy, I'd like to have a
wedding reception for you

11:10.214 --> 11:12.049
and I don't want you to say no.

11:12.116 --> 11:14.885
Okay, well, a wedding reception
would be for both Ricky and me

11:14.952 --> 11:17.021
and Ricky just doesn't want to do that

11:17.088 --> 11:20.858
and he's my husband, so
I can't let you do that.

11:20.925 --> 11:22.193
You or Dad. Or anyone else.

11:22.993 --> 11:24.895
But I thought you said...

11:24.962 --> 11:29.066
Shh! Look, Mom, you've got enough
to worry about with Ashley today.

11:29.133 --> 11:32.903
Ricky and I are fine. We're
just fine. Without a wedding.

11:32.970 --> 11:34.138
Another wedding.

I'm sorry. I have no idea
what she's doing here.

12:10.043 --> 12:13.980
It's all right. I
understand these things.

12:14.047 --> 12:17.050
You do? You understand my old
girlfriend showing up at practice?

12:18.919 --> 12:20.020
(SIGHS) Coach Watkins is
gonna kick me off the team.

12:20.086 --> 12:24.057
No, he's not. Now get over
there and make it fast.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.995
Hi!

12:29.062 --> 12:30.864
Grace, I told you I
don't want to talk to you.

12:30.931 --> 12:32.899
Well, that's besides the point
because I really want to talk to you.

12:32.966 --> 12:36.136
This is a really nice football
field, it's, like, so pretty!

12:36.202 --> 12:39.105
I'm at football practice.
This isn't high school!

12:39.172 --> 12:40.974
I can't just take time
out to talk to you.

12:41.041 --> 12:42.108
No matter how pretty it is here.

12:42.175 --> 12:43.877
Obviously you can.

12:43.944 --> 12:45.979
What are you doing?

12:46.046 --> 12:48.048
Don't be waving to my
coaches, Grace. Are you nuts?

12:48.114 --> 12:50.050
I'm nuts about our lord, Jesus.

12:50.116 --> 12:54.054
Oh, no. You came over
here to witness to me?

12:54.120 --> 12:57.991
I just feel like a new person
since going back to my old religion.

12:58.058 --> 13:00.860
Which, by the way,
is also your religion.

13:00.927 --> 13:04.798
I just hope that we can share
that religion together again.

13:04.864 --> 13:08.068
I'd like us to share something together
again, which is why I am not interested

13:08.134 --> 13:11.972
in renewing my faith in a religion that
doesn't condone sex in casual relationships.

13:12.038 --> 13:15.875
So, you're still sinning
with Raven? Kind of.

13:15.942 --> 13:18.945
Oh, no. Let me guess. You've settled
once again for oral sex and other things

13:19.012 --> 13:22.883
when what you really want is a real
relationship with a woman that you love

13:22.949 --> 13:23.950
and that loves you.

13:25.952 --> 13:27.153
I gotta go.

13:27.220 --> 13:28.889
So, I was talking to
Coach Watkins... What!

13:28.955 --> 13:32.125
And he doesn't have any objections
to you being a little more

13:32.192 --> 13:33.894
public about being a Christian.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.095
I am not a Christian.

13:35.161 --> 13:37.797
I don't claim to be a Christian.

13:37.864 --> 13:41.801
I don't wanna be a Christian or a Muslim
or a Buddhist or a Republican or a Democrat.

13:41.868 --> 13:44.004
And I can't pretend to
be something I'm not.

13:44.070 --> 13:46.806
Isn't that exactly
what you're doing? What?

13:46.873 --> 13:48.975
You're pretending not to be a
Christian when I know that you are.

13:49.042 --> 13:50.977
No, I'm not. I gotta go.

13:51.044 --> 13:52.145
Well, thank you for talking to me.

13:52.212 --> 13:54.014
I didn't want to talk to you.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.049
And don't ever show up at this
practice field again, Grace.

13:56.116 --> 13:59.819
Coach Watkins says I'm
welcome here any time.

13:59.886 --> 14:01.221
Have a blessed practice!

14:09.963 --> 14:10.964
She's a Christian?

14:11.031 --> 14:15.031
I'm not sure. I don't know what the
requirements are, but she says she is.

14:16.903 --> 14:20.874
It's a good angle. Christian
quarterback still in love

Adrian! This is so cool! Look
at you! You're in college.

14:46.032 --> 14:50.032
Not really, not for a couple more
days. I'm just in the college bookstore.

14:52.038 --> 14:53.006
I'll see you around, okay, Grace?

14:54.040 --> 14:57.878
Okay, I totally deserve this.

14:57.944 --> 14:58.979
Look, I'm really sorry about how
I acted the last time I saw you.

14:59.045 --> 15:03.045
Shh. Do not say anything about anything.

15:04.050 --> 15:06.052
This is my new school.
This is my new life.

15:06.119 --> 15:09.990
Speaking of new life... Don't
say anything about that, either.

15:10.056 --> 15:11.858
About you and your new life.

15:11.925 --> 15:12.092
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to believe it.

15:12.158 --> 15:15.061
You're like the boy that
cried wolf too many times.

15:15.128 --> 15:18.899
You're right, you're absolutely right.

15:18.965 --> 15:23.136
But, you know, eventually there was a wolf,
a real wolf. Just like there is a real...

15:23.203 --> 15:26.139
No, no, no, no. Don't want to hear it.

15:26.206 --> 15:28.074
I don't blame you for not believing me.

15:28.141 --> 15:31.144
I haven't exactly been a good
shepherd the past few years.

15:31.211 --> 15:35.211
Or is it sheep? Good sheep? Can
sheep be both plural and singular?

15:36.917 --> 15:38.885
I haven't been a good
leader or a good follower,

15:38.952 --> 15:40.086
a good shepherd or a good sheep?

15:40.153 --> 15:44.153
Neither. You've been more
like a good fisher of men.

15:45.091 --> 15:47.794
I can't believe you
even know the reference!

15:47.861 --> 15:51.861
Yeah, look, I just came to pick up a book
I ordered and then I'm getting out of here,

15:52.933 --> 15:56.933
so good luck to you and have a good
senior year and we'll see you. Or not.

16:00.073 --> 16:03.810
Well, I'm really happy that I
ran into you. I really missed you.

16:03.877 --> 16:07.877
And I really wanted to apologize,
so thanks for letting me do that.

16:09.049 --> 16:09.816
And I don't know if you're interested

16:09.883 --> 16:11.851
but if you want to come
to church with me any time,

16:11.918 --> 16:13.887
I'd love to take you.

16:13.954 --> 16:16.056
Not interested.

16:16.122 --> 16:18.058
I understand. But maybe
some time in the future.

16:18.124 --> 16:22.028
No. Okay, well, just let me
know if you change your mind.

16:22.095 --> 16:23.029
I won't change my mind.

16:23.096 --> 16:25.899
(SIGHING) Look, Adrian,
I just think that maybe

16:25.966 --> 16:29.135
the school board would look more favorably
on Omar if you're both churchgoers,

16:29.202 --> 16:31.972
you know?

16:32.038 --> 16:34.874
Okay, I hope I'm not going to be hitting
myself in the head later for asking you this,

16:34.941 --> 16:36.977
but what the hell are you talking about?

16:37.043 --> 16:39.012
The investigation.

16:41.982 --> 16:43.116
What investigation?

16:43.183 --> 16:46.152
The investigation into whether
or not Omar is a pervert.

16:46.219 --> 16:48.855
Omar is having the school board
investigate the whole thing to try

16:48.922 --> 16:51.925
to clear his name. But that may prove
to be more difficult than he thinks.

16:51.992 --> 16:53.860
Because?

16:53.927 --> 16:57.864
Because first he dated you, and then
he came to our school where there are

16:57.931 --> 16:59.099
many more high school girls.

16:59.165 --> 17:01.801
Omar is not a pervert.
That's ridiculous.

17:01.868 --> 17:03.904
And I don't believe anyone on the
school board is going to believe that.

17:03.970 --> 17:05.972
I know, but that's the
power of suggestion.

17:06.039 --> 17:08.174
Ben suggested that Omar
is a pervert and now

17:08.241 --> 17:10.810
people at school are talking
about it like it's a possibility.

17:10.877 --> 17:13.813
But I'm sure the lord will
see Omar through his travails.

17:13.880 --> 17:17.880
You know what? I hate the lingo. Okay?
The travails, the lords, the sheep, the...

17:19.051 --> 17:23.051
Fish? Can't help it. I'm
just filled with the spirit.

17:24.089 --> 17:26.026
Yeah. You're filled with something.

17:26.092 --> 17:28.094
Have a blessed afternoon
in the bookstore, Adrian.

17:35.614 --> 17:35.614
+

17:34.370 --> 17:35.271
(RINGING)

17:38.341 --> 17:39.542
Go ahead.

17:41.444 --> 17:44.214
Hi, Adrian, could I call you back?

17:44.280 --> 17:47.083
You know Omar is having the school
investigate your calling him a pervert?

17:47.150 --> 17:51.150
I have to call you back.
I'm actually... In a meeting.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.157
A meeting with who?
Let me call you back.

17:54.224 --> 17:57.327
Oh, yeah. Let's talk about
your calling Omar a pervert.

17:59.329 --> 18:02.465
Look, it's nothing.
Nothing legal, anyway.

18:02.532 --> 18:05.435
Not like this fire situation.

18:05.502 --> 18:08.138
Uh, it could be legal.

18:08.204 --> 18:12.204
And it could be worse than this
fire situation. Is Omar a pervert?

18:14.210 --> 18:15.445
Do you have reason to
believe he's a pervert?

18:15.512 --> 18:18.381
No. Not really. And that's not
what I came here to talk about.

18:18.448 --> 18:23.119
I realize that, but, (SIGHS) Ben,

18:23.186 --> 18:25.455
if you're going around calling teachers
perverts, you better have a reason.

18:25.522 --> 18:29.522
And if you do have a reason, I want to know,
because, one, he's a danger to the school

18:30.460 --> 18:34.264
and, two, he says he's
in love with Adrian.

18:34.330 --> 18:39.202
Well, there's no evidence
that he's a pervert.

18:39.269 --> 18:40.303
Is it your gut feeling he's a pervert?

18:40.370 --> 18:43.406
No, look. I pretty much just falsely
accused him of being a pervert and now

18:43.473 --> 18:48.211
there's some school board
investigation or something.

18:48.278 --> 18:52.282
Yeah. And if they conclude that you made
up some lie that harms Omar's reputation,

18:52.348 --> 18:55.218
there might be a civil case against
you to go along with the criminal case.

18:55.285 --> 18:56.419
I know that. Look.

18:56.486 --> 19:00.089
I just went into that school
with Dylan to get a tour

19:00.156 --> 19:01.324
of the school and we ended
up in the science lab and...

19:01.391 --> 19:04.327
Stop! Just stop right there.

19:06.329 --> 19:08.097
I advise you to get an attorney.

19:08.164 --> 19:10.200
Really? Before you confess to a crime,

19:10.266 --> 19:11.434
well, yeah, you're gonna
need to get an attorney.

19:12.268 --> 19:14.237
Are you about to confess to a crime?

19:16.239 --> 19:17.307
Does your father know you're doing this?

19:17.373 --> 19:19.242
No. He told me to handle it on my own.

19:19.309 --> 19:24.180
Look, Ben, the reason I wanted to talk
to you the other day was that I thought

19:24.247 --> 19:28.247
you knew something you weren't saying,
like maybe your girlfriend did something

19:28.351 --> 19:31.221
that you would never do, maybe you were
covering up for something that you might

19:31.287 --> 19:33.123
want to tell me about.

19:33.189 --> 19:36.226
Does that mean there's a
criminal investigation going on?

19:38.261 --> 19:39.496
Dylan's father said there wasn't.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.302
But, of course, I guess you wouldn't
necessarily tell either one of us

19:46.369 --> 19:50.369
if there was or if we're... Oh,
God, are we suspects? Arson suspects?

19:52.242 --> 19:53.243
You're not going to
faint again, are you?

19:53.309 --> 19:55.345
I hope not. Okay.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.247
Look, let's get your dad to
come in. He should be here.

19:57.313 --> 20:01.184
No. I don't want my dad to come in.

20:01.251 --> 20:04.187
Look. He told me to handle it on
my own and I'm going to handle it.

20:04.254 --> 20:08.254
I don't think I started any fire
at that school, but I was there.

20:08.491 --> 20:12.395
And we lit a Bunsen
burner... Oh, geez, Ben!

20:13.363 --> 20:15.165
(SIGHS)

20:15.231 --> 20:15.431
(INTERCOM BEEPS) Carol?

20:15.498 --> 20:19.169
Yes, sir?  Could you get me
Detective Shanahan, please?

20:19.235 --> 20:21.104
Right away.  What?

20:21.171 --> 20:24.374
I'm going out with Jack for her.
I'm trying to get information.

20:24.440 --> 20:28.077
And I'm not getting it
by having sex with him.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.146
We're just fooling around.

20:30.213 --> 20:32.282
There are better ways
to get information.

20:32.348 --> 20:34.451
We can just get Wendy to ask her
dad if he knows anything about

20:34.517 --> 20:36.252
the school burning down. No, we can't!

20:36.319 --> 20:39.289
We can't ask him! He's a cop.

20:39.355 --> 20:40.390
Which is why he would know something.

20:40.457 --> 20:43.092
Oh, no. Is that where Wendy is?

20:43.159 --> 20:45.328
Is she talking to her dad?

20:45.395 --> 20:47.397
I don't know. She might be.

20:47.464 --> 20:51.201
(SIGHS) Great. What if he jumps to the
conclusion that all of us are involved?

20:51.267 --> 20:53.303
Why all of us and not Wendy?

20:53.369 --> 20:55.371
Because he doesn't think that Wendy
could be involved with anything illegal.

20:55.438 --> 20:59.175
Why not? Why not?

20:59.242 --> 21:00.143
Because she hasn't had sex.

21:00.210 --> 21:02.245
So, he totally trusts her.

21:04.314 --> 21:06.316
I've got that same thing going on here.

21:06.382 --> 21:09.319
What does not having sex have
to do with not starting a fire?

21:09.385 --> 21:13.385
It makes Wendy and me more trustworthy. We
don't have sex so we don't do anything wrong.

21:15.325 --> 21:18.328
Except maybe burn a
school down here and there.

21:18.394 --> 21:21.431
No, I didn't! I did not
burn the school down.

21:21.498 --> 21:25.168
Who lit the Bunsen
burner? The Bunsen burner?

21:25.235 --> 21:26.436
Who lit it? You lit it?

21:26.503 --> 21:28.171
(SIGHING) Oh, no.

21:31.474 --> 21:33.076
Who lit the Bunsen burner?

21:33.143 --> 21:35.345
Don't answer that. I don't remember.

21:35.411 --> 21:38.281
I'm your attorney.
I'm here to advise you.

21:38.348 --> 21:41.084
And I advise you to not answer any
questions at this time, Mr. Boykewich.

21:41.151 --> 21:44.254
But I really don't remember.
How can that hurt me?

21:44.320 --> 21:45.355
You might remember later.

21:46.156 --> 21:48.291
And... (CHUCKLES)

21:48.358 --> 21:51.294
And it'll look as if you
lied about not remembering.

21:51.361 --> 21:53.329
Don't answer any more questions, please.

21:55.265 --> 21:59.135
Let me ask you something.
Is this your first case?

21:59.202 --> 22:02.172
What difference does that make?

22:02.238 --> 22:04.274
I don't remember who
lit the Bunsen burner.

22:07.343 --> 22:08.244
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:11.095 --> 22:11.095
+

22:18.418 --> 22:19.253
I thought I might find you here.

22:19.319 --> 22:22.256
(CHUCKLES) I work here.

22:22.322 --> 22:26.322
Yeah. I brought you some tacos,

22:26.526 --> 22:28.562
thought you might like a little snack.

22:28.629 --> 22:32.332
Thanks for coming by,
but don't shut that door.

22:32.399 --> 22:33.267
Why did you tell the school board

22:33.333 --> 22:35.569
to investigate whether
or not you're a pervert?

22:35.636 --> 22:38.472
I had to, but we can't talk about it.

22:38.539 --> 22:40.607
The investigation could
end up going the other way.

22:40.674 --> 22:42.609
It's the power of suggestion.

22:42.676 --> 22:44.444
Ben said you were a pervert and now

22:44.511 --> 22:46.380
people might actually
think that for no reason.

22:46.446 --> 22:48.549
As much as I'd like to continue
this conversation, I really can't.

22:48.615 --> 22:52.319
I've been told not to talk
about this with anyone.

22:52.386 --> 22:55.322
And I have a feeling the school board
might want to ask you a few questions.

22:55.389 --> 22:58.358
I'm not a student here. They
can't ask me any questions.

22:58.425 --> 23:00.260
Adrian, I don't know how that works.

23:00.327 --> 23:01.428
Maybe they can, maybe they can't.

23:01.495 --> 23:05.532
But if they do, just
tell them the truth.

23:05.599 --> 23:09.436
Okay, well, the truth is everyone lies.

23:09.503 --> 23:13.373
So, if they ask me anything, I'm going
to tell them we're both Christians

23:13.440 --> 23:17.444
and that we were attracted to each
other because we are both sheep.

23:17.511 --> 23:19.346
And the lord has seen
us through many travails.

23:19.413 --> 23:21.415
Who are you, my mother?

23:21.481 --> 23:23.517
Do not pretend to be
something you're not.

23:23.584 --> 23:26.420
Not for me, anyway. I love
you just the way you are.

23:26.486 --> 23:28.589
And we haven't done anything wrong.

23:28.655 --> 23:30.357
And I haven't done anything wrong.

23:30.424 --> 23:32.392
That might not matter.

23:32.459 --> 23:35.329
(SIGHS) Oh, look who's here.

23:36.463 --> 23:40.463
Bye, Adrian.

23:42.369 --> 23:44.371
You see how that's done?
You talk, then you walk.

23:44.705 --> 23:47.341
Bye, Adrian.

23:49.676 --> 23:52.512
You walk. You're not getting
the walk portion of this lecture.

23:52.579 --> 23:55.349
Walk with me. Uh...

23:55.415 --> 23:56.516
That's how it's done.

23:56.583 --> 23:59.519
And keep walking. You were told not
to discuss this matter with anyone.

23:59.586 --> 24:02.356
I know.

24:02.422 --> 24:03.523
And keep walking.

24:05.626 --> 24:08.428
Bunny said to tell you to cook this
cut longer and slower if you have

24:08.495 --> 24:10.397
the time, like 325 for three hours.

24:10.464 --> 24:11.632
Perfect. Thanks.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.469
Hi, Son-in-law.
Hi, Mom.

24:15.535 --> 24:17.604
I guess you got three moms now.

24:17.671 --> 24:20.340
I'm a lucky guy, I think.
What are you doing here?

24:20.407 --> 24:23.443
I was driving down to talk
to George about Ashley.

24:23.510 --> 24:26.246
Ashley took off for Italy
without telling anyone.

24:26.313 --> 24:28.315
Oh, yeah, Amy texted me. We
didn't give her any money.

24:28.382 --> 24:32.382
Ashley's pretty resourceful and she's
smart, so I guess she'll be okay.

24:34.321 --> 24:36.456
Still, she is only 17, and I
feel really guilty for suggesting

24:36.523 --> 24:39.293
that she might like that school.

24:39.359 --> 24:42.462
Anyway, I guess that
Ashley's just being Ashley.

24:42.529 --> 24:46.266
I guess she's on her own
whether we like it or not.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.268
Just like you and Amy are on your own,

24:48.335 --> 24:51.672
but I want you to know that I would very
much like to be a part of your life together.

24:52.406 --> 24:55.509
Okay, well, thanks for dropping by.

24:55.576 --> 24:57.311
Wait, I'd like to talk to you.

24:57.377 --> 24:57.611
Can you take five minutes?

24:57.678 --> 25:01.615
Uh, Bunny really hates
it when we have visitors.

25:01.682 --> 25:05.682
Okay, then I'll buy something.
Give me three steaks.

25:06.486 --> 25:09.323
I'll take some steaks over to the
house for your mom and for George.

25:09.389 --> 25:09.590
We'll have steak tonight.

25:09.656 --> 25:12.392
Oh, no, you don't have to buy anything.

25:12.459 --> 25:15.295
No, it's fine, I don't want
you to get into trouble.

25:15.362 --> 25:16.563
I'll bring over some
steaks to you after work.

25:16.630 --> 25:20.267
No. I don't want you to do that.

25:20.334 --> 25:23.570
I wanna just pay for the steaks and take
them out of here like any other customer.

25:23.637 --> 25:27.637
So, give me three steaks and I
want you and Amy to have a wedding.

25:29.443 --> 25:30.611
How 'bout just the steaks?

25:30.677 --> 25:33.313
Ricky, I know it's not
important to you right now

25:33.380 --> 25:37.317
but it is important to have some kind
of celebration with friends and family.

25:39.419 --> 25:41.388
Maybe for other couples, but
it's just not important to us.

25:41.455 --> 25:44.458
Not important to the two of
you or not important to you?

25:44.524 --> 25:49.363
My mom is dying. Her
Alzheimer's is getting worse

25:49.429 --> 25:50.631
and I want her there at your wedding.

25:50.697 --> 25:53.267
It'll make up for her
not being at my wedding.

25:53.333 --> 25:57.333
And I know that sounds selfish, and
it is selfish, but please, Ricky,

25:58.338 --> 26:01.441
I don't want Amy to regret my not
being at her wedding like I'm regretting

26:01.508 --> 26:02.643
my mother not being at my wedding.

26:02.709 --> 26:06.647
But, I hate to point
this out, you're divorced.

26:06.713 --> 26:09.583
I don't care. I still wish
my mother was at my wedding.

26:09.650 --> 26:11.251
But you're gay. Does the
wedding even matter now?

26:11.318 --> 26:15.255
That's not the point. The
point is not to have regrets.

26:15.322 --> 26:18.425
So, please, Ricky. Let me
just throw you a wedding,

26:18.492 --> 26:21.428
or a wedding reception or
a party or something else.

26:21.495 --> 26:24.631
Sooner or later, someone is going
to do it and I want it to be me.

26:24.698 --> 26:28.335
I want to be a part of your lives.
I wanna be a part of Amy's life.

26:28.402 --> 26:29.436
(SIGHS) I don't know what to say.

26:29.503 --> 26:31.572
Then say yes.

26:31.638 --> 26:35.638
Look. I can't speak for Amy, I can't, but
whatever Amy says, I'll go along with her.

26:37.311 --> 26:40.414
No, whatever you say, Amy
will go along with you.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.549
How about we just have a little,
small wedding in the backyard?

26:42.616 --> 26:45.352
All you have to do is show
up. You have to ask Amy.

26:45.419 --> 26:47.554
You eloped when George
asked you to elope,

26:47.621 --> 26:49.590
so you already had the
wedding he asked you to have,

26:49.656 --> 26:52.426
so now I'm asking you to have the
wedding that I want you to have.

26:52.492 --> 26:54.428
What's the big deal?
You're already married.

26:54.494 --> 26:57.264
What's the harm in celebrating?

26:57.331 --> 26:59.399
(SIGHS) Oh, man.

26:59.466 --> 27:01.568
I know this is a terrible thing to do
to you but I'm only asking you because

27:01.635 --> 27:04.271
I really want you to do it.

27:04.338 --> 27:05.305
And I think that it's
something that Amy wants, too.

27:05.372 --> 27:07.608
I'm not so sure about that.

27:07.674 --> 27:09.509
Amy told me, Ricky.

27:09.576 --> 27:12.479
She told me that you don't want to
have a wedding but that she does.

27:12.546 --> 27:14.414
I thought that maybe she didn't.

27:14.481 --> 27:16.550
That she ran off because she
didn't wanna have a wedding

27:16.617 --> 27:20.320
or she didn't want me at
her wedding if she had one.

27:20.387 --> 27:23.357
But, apparently that's not true and
I feel guilty for even thinking that.

27:23.423 --> 27:25.592
So, come on, let her have a wedding.

27:25.659 --> 27:28.462
It's not a matter of me letting her.

27:28.528 --> 27:30.564
Wait. Amy said I don't want a wedding?

27:30.631 --> 27:33.433
She said she wants a
wedding, but I don't?

27:33.500 --> 27:35.636
That's what she said this morning.

27:35.702 --> 27:38.338
All right, then.

27:38.405 --> 27:39.606
All right? Yeah. Whatever you want.

27:39.673 --> 27:43.673
Whatever you and Amy want. And do
it up as big as you want. Go all out.

27:44.678 --> 27:46.547
Well, I don't know
how big Amy would want.

27:46.613 --> 27:49.416
I don't know either. But
the sooner, the better.

27:49.483 --> 27:51.585
Well, if it's going to be a big
wedding, it's gonna take some time.

27:51.652 --> 27:54.421
How about we go back
to that July fourth date

27:54.488 --> 27:55.455
that you set in the first place?

27:55.522 --> 27:57.524
That's almost a year from now.

27:57.591 --> 27:59.593
It'll give me time to find
a date for the wedding.

27:59.660 --> 28:01.528
I'm sure you'll be dating soon enough.

28:01.595 --> 28:05.332
I hope so. Thank you Ricky.
Amy is going to be so happy!

28:05.399 --> 28:06.700
I'm so glad you let
me talk you into this!

28:07.401 --> 28:09.269
Yeah. You talked me into this.

28:09.336 --> 28:11.605
And when Amy asks how this
happened, remember that.

28:11.672 --> 28:14.608
You talked me into this.
Don't forget your steaks.

28:14.675 --> 28:18.512
I got what I wanted. Bye. I love you.

28:18.579 --> 28:20.714
Oh. Love you, too. And
please, take the steaks.

28:28.799 --> 28:28.799
+

28:30.894 --> 28:34.664
You know, arson cases
are really hard to prove.

28:34.731 --> 28:35.565
Unless someone confesses!

28:35.632 --> 28:37.600
I didn't confess.

28:37.667 --> 28:38.902
Yeah, you kind of did.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.704
Fine. I just want to get it over with.

28:41.771 --> 28:44.674
(CHUCKLES) This is just starting.

28:44.741 --> 28:46.609
This is gonna go on
for months and months.

28:46.676 --> 28:48.745
The arson investigation might
have come to a close this week

28:48.811 --> 28:50.613
if you hadn't confessed!

28:50.680 --> 28:52.615
Yeah, but I'd still
be worrying day to day

28:52.682 --> 28:53.650
whether I had done the right thing.

28:53.716 --> 28:54.884
I can use that.

28:54.951 --> 28:57.754
That's the first thing that you've
said that I could possibly use.

29:01.891 --> 29:04.761
Hey, Dad, what are you
doing out here? Hey.

29:04.827 --> 29:07.764
Oh! I brought you something. Dinner.

29:07.830 --> 29:12.635
Uh, this is not a good time.
Thanks and I'll see you later.

29:12.702 --> 29:16.702
Uh, from Poppy's Tacos. Oh,
come on, have dinner with me.

29:17.874 --> 29:20.610
Adrian, this is really sweet of you
but you should have called first.

29:20.677 --> 29:23.546
I'm right in the middle of something.

29:23.613 --> 29:26.850
Oh, geez. You know about Ben and
the fire? Is that what this is about?

29:26.916 --> 29:28.618
Um...

29:28.685 --> 29:31.721
I had to excuse myself
from the case, of course.

29:31.788 --> 29:34.891
He confessed. He came in and
confessed to burning the school down.

29:34.958 --> 29:37.660
I was pretty sure he'd rat
out the girlfriend, but no.

29:37.727 --> 29:42.599
The school. Yeah. The
girlfriend's school, right?

29:42.665 --> 29:43.900
Right. (SCOFFS)

29:45.702 --> 29:48.605
Uh...

29:48.671 --> 29:50.640
Yeah, I didn't know.

29:50.707 --> 29:50.874
What do you mean you didn't know?

29:50.940 --> 29:53.743
Why'd you bring me
dinner if you didn't know?

29:53.810 --> 29:54.811
I thought you might be able
to stop the school board

29:54.878 --> 29:57.814
from continuing this
investigation with Omar.

29:57.881 --> 29:59.849
I don't want him to
get pegged as a perv.

29:59.916 --> 30:01.818
Well, I can't do anything about that.

30:01.885 --> 30:05.922
That's not a criminal case. It's
just a school board investigation.

30:05.989 --> 30:09.826
Right now, anyway. But you're
right, it could backfire.

30:09.893 --> 30:13.596
But if it doesn't, I wouldn't be
surprised if it turns into a civil case.

30:13.663 --> 30:16.599
Especially since Ben comes
from the money he comes from.

30:16.666 --> 30:19.936
Wait a minute. Do you think there's any
possibility my condo could be taken away?

30:20.003 --> 30:21.671
I doubt it. But, Adrian,
you can always live with us.

30:22.939 --> 30:26.776
I'm done here. That kid's an idiot.

30:26.843 --> 30:29.712
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this the girlfriend?

30:29.779 --> 30:30.880
Ex-wife.

30:33.716 --> 30:34.884
Oh. Your... Daughter.

30:35.818 --> 30:36.920
Sorry.

30:40.790 --> 30:45.628
Wow. Ben? Ben burned down the school?

30:46.729 --> 30:47.897
I burned...

30:49.966 --> 30:50.733
What are you doing here? Well.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.802
I came down here to try to save Omar

30:52.869 --> 30:55.805
but you need divine intervention
just as much as he does.

30:57.974 --> 30:59.876
How would you feel
about going to church?

31:02.712 --> 31:03.880
Geez, it was just an idea.

31:08.618 --> 31:09.619
No?

31:10.787 --> 31:12.922
(REUNITEDÂ  PLAYING)

31:23.933 --> 31:26.903
I remember how much fun we
used to have cooking together.

31:26.970 --> 31:28.805
Do you remember what
we did after dinner?

31:28.872 --> 31:31.574
(CHUCKLES) Not after. That was before.

31:31.641 --> 31:32.942
Oh, that's right. And a
couple of times, during.

31:33.009 --> 31:34.010
(KATHLEEN CHUCKLING)

31:34.978 --> 31:36.679
(SCREAMS)

31:40.750 --> 31:42.819
It's like seeing a jack-in-the-box
in the window, isn't it?

31:42.886 --> 31:44.754
Is she waiting for us to
tell her to come in or what?

31:44.821 --> 31:46.756
It's still her house. Ooh, she's mad.

31:47.957 --> 31:49.592
Aren't you going to invite me in?

31:49.659 --> 31:50.994
Hi, Anne. Not you. You don't live here.

31:52.795 --> 31:54.597
Does she?

31:54.664 --> 31:56.900
No. And neither do you. But
come on in, it's your house.

31:56.966 --> 31:59.569
I didn't know you were
coming, but it is your house.

31:59.636 --> 32:00.703
Did you hear from Ashley? Did you?

32:00.770 --> 32:01.804
I asked you first.

32:01.871 --> 32:04.807
I'll just be in the
living room or somewhere.

32:04.874 --> 32:06.609
Oh, no, stay here. This is what
life with George will be like.

32:06.676 --> 32:10.676
Not like this. Not like
flowers and candles and dancing.

32:11.848 --> 32:13.783
Did you want to dance with her?

32:13.850 --> 32:16.953
No, I did not. I wanted to come and
have dinner with you and Nora to talk

32:17.020 --> 32:18.655
about Amy's and Ricky's
wedding, which I'm planning.

32:18.721 --> 32:21.858
Not to say I won't be including the
rest of you in the decision making.

32:21.925 --> 32:23.593
That's over, done,
already taken care of.

32:23.660 --> 32:25.762
I planned the wedding
and the wedding is over.

32:25.828 --> 32:27.764
They want to have another
wedding, a real wedding.

32:27.830 --> 32:30.600
No they don't. You do, so you can
get over Mimsy not coming to ours.

32:30.667 --> 32:32.869
Okay, we can talk about this some
other time. I have to get home.

32:33.970 --> 32:36.739
And by the way, Ashley did call me.

32:36.806 --> 32:38.908
No, she didn't. If she had, you'd
know where she got the money,

32:38.975 --> 32:40.844
and if you knew where she got
the money, you wouldn't be here.

32:40.910 --> 32:42.812
You'd be over at Mimsy's or wherever her
husband Eugene is. If he's still around.

32:42.879 --> 32:45.815
He's still around.
George, just tell her.

32:45.882 --> 32:46.916
I don't need your help.

32:48.852 --> 32:51.821
Ow! Ow! Okay! Okay, it was your mother.

32:51.888 --> 32:54.557
Apparently, Eugene missed
one of her accounts.

32:54.624 --> 32:56.926
She sent sugarplum 10 grand.

32:56.993 --> 32:58.695
What! That's right. So I
guess we'll be seeing Ashley

32:58.761 --> 32:59.829
in what, a couple of years?

32:59.896 --> 33:01.831
How did this happen? I'll
tell you how it happened.

33:01.898 --> 33:03.733
Even with her brain not working,
she's smarter than all of us.

33:03.800 --> 33:04.901
Ten grand?

33:06.769 --> 33:08.905
(SIGHS) Okay, I have to
go. I have to get home.

33:08.972 --> 33:10.940
Good night. Good night, Kathleen.

33:11.007 --> 33:15.645
And I'm sorry about before. Of course,
you're welcome to come to the wedding.

33:15.712 --> 33:17.680
Even if you come with him. Hmm.

33:17.747 --> 33:19.716
Of course you'll come with
him. Wedding's over. No wedding.

33:19.782 --> 33:23.653
Either way, I really
appreciate the invitation.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.889
And don't go like this. Why don't
you stay and have dinner with us.

33:25.955 --> 33:26.689
No!

33:26.756 --> 33:28.725
Well, I did bring some steaks.

33:28.791 --> 33:31.628
Perfect! Sounds good.

33:31.995 --> 33:32.662
Come on. Sit down.

33:38.701 --> 33:42.701
I don't know where he is. I feel
really bad how I left this morning.

33:44.007 --> 33:45.742
It's hard not to help him.

33:45.808 --> 33:47.844
It's also hard to watch
him continue to screw up.

33:47.911 --> 33:49.913
Leo, if Ben gets involved in
some kind of criminal case,

33:49.979 --> 33:51.814
I think maybe you should help him.

33:51.881 --> 33:55.618
No. I said I wouldn't.
And I'm not going to.

33:55.685 --> 34:00.657
I have to draw the line some place and
this may not a good place, but what is?

34:00.723 --> 34:02.659
Well, I agree with the part where
you said this isn't a good place.

34:02.725 --> 34:05.728
Look, you can't let Ben go to jail.

34:05.795 --> 34:08.831
Ah, he's not gonna go to jail, but he's
going to have to think he is before he stops

34:08.898 --> 34:11.734
rescuing girls who like
to get into trouble.

34:11.801 --> 34:13.703
I'm going to have to let him
be scared out of his wits.

34:13.770 --> 34:16.873
Otherwise, he's not
going to learn anything.

34:16.940 --> 34:20.677
My guys tell me they don't think
the police will ever pursue this.

34:20.743 --> 34:22.812
There's not any evidence that it's
anything other than a leaky gas line.

34:22.879 --> 34:25.681
Still, he has to clear himself.

34:25.748 --> 34:26.850
(KNOCKS)

34:28.751 --> 34:31.621
I confessed. You confessed?

34:31.688 --> 34:33.822
To what, exactly?

34:33.889 --> 34:36.726
I don't know. That I started the fire.

34:36.793 --> 34:39.929
That we were there and we lit the Bunsen
burner and we may have burned down the school.

34:39.996 --> 34:42.632
You don't know that you did
that but you confessed? What!

34:42.699 --> 34:45.702
Isn't that what you wanted me to do?

34:45.768 --> 34:48.605
I wanted you to tell the truth to
Ruben, or whoever you talked to.

34:48.670 --> 34:49.906
It was your girlfriend who
lied her way into the building.

34:49.973 --> 34:53.743
It was your girlfriend who roasted the
marshmallows over that Bunsen burner,

34:53.810 --> 34:55.812
and she lit that Bunsen
burner. Yeah, but...

34:55.879 --> 34:58.548
Yeah, but it was your
girlfriend who locked up,

34:58.615 --> 35:00.683
turned off the lights
and closed the door.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.852
You told me that. Did you tell
Ruben that in your confession?

35:02.919 --> 35:04.821
I left it at "I can't remember."

35:04.888 --> 35:07.924
And the police are all involved
now. I got a public defender.

35:07.991 --> 35:10.660
What! Look.

35:10.727 --> 35:12.829
You wanted me to handle
it and I handled it.

35:12.896 --> 35:14.597
Maybe you should go back to letting
all the blood rush to your brain.

35:14.664 --> 35:15.965
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

35:19.969 --> 35:22.572
Dylan. Hi, I was going to call you.

35:22.639 --> 35:25.742
Why is there a Detective Shanahan
in the living room with my parents?

35:25.808 --> 35:28.678
Don't panic. It's all going to be fine.

35:28.745 --> 35:30.613
No, it's not.

35:33.782 --> 35:33.782
+

35:40.758 --> 35:41.726
Go find Bennie and he can
eat dinner with us, okay?

35:43.794 --> 35:44.862
Okay? Okay.

35:44.929 --> 35:46.697
Okay.

35:46.764 --> 35:47.698
Thanks, bud.

35:51.002 --> 35:52.670
Who's Bennie?

35:52.737 --> 35:53.804
His bear.

35:53.871 --> 35:55.673
I thought that was Frankie.

35:55.740 --> 35:57.875
His new friend at school is
Bennie, so Now the bear is Bennie.

35:58.676 --> 36:01.646
Ooh! What smells so good?

36:01.712 --> 36:03.581
Lasagna. I didn't have a lot of time.
I closed up the shop tonight for Bunny.

36:03.648 --> 36:07.785
Here. You got a package from
Mimsy. It came overnight.

36:07.852 --> 36:11.822
Just toss it, it's probably just another
bag of socks. She keeps sending me socks.

36:11.889 --> 36:13.624
You can open it later.
Guess who dropped by today?

36:13.691 --> 36:14.892
Who? Your mom.

36:14.959 --> 36:17.828
Are you calling one of your
moms my mom or you mean...

36:17.895 --> 36:19.563
Anne. Your mom.

36:19.630 --> 36:20.965
She dropped by here?
By the butcher shop.

36:21.032 --> 36:23.868
(SIGHS) Oh, no.

36:23.934 --> 36:27.605
Yeah. Oh, no. Did you tell her
I didn't want to have a wedding?

36:27.672 --> 36:29.607
I'm sorry. I had to tell her that.

36:29.674 --> 36:30.741
I couldn't take the pressure.
You can take the pressure.

36:30.808 --> 36:34.645
Uh, no, actually I can't. I couldn't.

36:34.712 --> 36:36.747
What does that mean?

36:36.814 --> 36:38.816
That means I agreed to have a wedding.

36:38.883 --> 36:40.918
You did what?

36:40.985 --> 36:44.555
I told you this lie is getting bigger and
bigger and now we have to have a wedding.

36:44.622 --> 36:46.924
Or a wedding reception. Or
a big party or something.

36:46.991 --> 36:47.892
No, we don't! And I
certainly do not want

36:47.958 --> 36:51.896
my mother in charge of our
wedding or a wedding reception

36:51.962 --> 36:53.698
or a big party for us!

36:53.764 --> 36:55.666
Why is that?

36:55.733 --> 36:57.735
Because that's the reason why I didn't
want a big wedding in the first place!

36:57.802 --> 36:59.937
I don't want her to be at our wedding!

37:00.805 --> 37:02.740
Because?

37:02.807 --> 37:06.777
Because I'm not that comfortable with her
being gay and my parents being divorced

37:06.844 --> 37:07.712
and her being gay.

37:07.778 --> 37:10.648
And you know what else? I hate Ashley!

37:10.715 --> 37:13.818
She's not comfortable with it
either and she just ran away!

37:13.884 --> 37:16.654
Again! To Europe! I've
never even been to Canada!

37:16.721 --> 37:20.925
Well, at least you're starting
to tell the truth, my fake wife.

37:20.992 --> 37:23.561
We're going back to that squirrel guy.

37:23.627 --> 37:25.830
Even if we do, we're still going to have to
go along with the wedding that your mother

37:25.896 --> 37:28.766
wants to have all because you said
you wanted a wedding and I didn't.

37:28.833 --> 37:32.670
Ugh! Why did I tell our stupid
parents that we're married?

37:32.737 --> 37:33.738
Yeah.

37:36.774 --> 37:39.810
Grace talked to Jack's dad and he
said we could use the church hall

37:39.877 --> 37:41.846
as long as there's no
drugs or alcohol involved.

37:41.912 --> 37:45.912
I don't know, Madison. Amy's mom was pretty
clear that she didn't want us to do anything.

37:46.717 --> 37:50.655
Well, it's not a wedding. They're
already married, it's just...

37:50.721 --> 37:51.555
A party for the whole school?

37:51.622 --> 37:54.625
Not for the whole school,

37:54.692 --> 37:55.559
but we don't want to leave anyone out

37:55.626 --> 37:58.729
so we should probably just
invite anyone who wants to come.

37:58.796 --> 38:01.899
But no parents of course,
that way Mrs. Juergens...

38:01.966 --> 38:04.769
Oh, wait. She's not Mrs. Juergens
anymore. What do we call her?

38:04.835 --> 38:08.572
What we've always called her, Amy's mom.

38:08.639 --> 38:11.575
Right. Well, Amy's mom
doesn't have to know.

38:11.642 --> 38:13.811
Yeah, but what if she
does throw them a wedding,

38:13.878 --> 38:16.580
then she'll be upset with
us and she won't invite us.

38:16.647 --> 38:18.816
Amy is not going to let
her throw her a wedding.

38:18.883 --> 38:20.685
Ricky doesn't want one.

38:20.751 --> 38:22.787
No, it was Amy who doesn't want one.

38:22.853 --> 38:25.823
I don't care who wants what. It's
a good reason to throw a party,

38:25.890 --> 38:28.793
and Amy should probably register
for some china or some flatware.

38:28.859 --> 38:32.563
Yeah, and crystal or
glasses. And linens.

38:32.630 --> 38:36.567
They'll need linens, like
sheets and towels and stuff.

38:36.634 --> 38:40.604
Yeah. And pots and pans.
'Cause Ricky loves to cook.

38:40.671 --> 38:42.907
And I bet they don't have a coffeemaker.

38:42.974 --> 38:44.809
I don't think they drink coffee.

38:44.875 --> 38:48.579
Okay, well, they'll need other
appliances. Like a popcorn maker.

38:48.646 --> 38:49.780
A waffle iron.

38:49.847 --> 38:51.649
A blender.

38:52.984 --> 38:55.920
Not a wedding, a dinner party.

38:55.987 --> 38:58.622
For 50 people or so.

38:58.689 --> 38:58.923
That's not a wedding.

38:58.990 --> 39:01.792
If we're going to throw a
wedding, let's throw a wedding.

39:01.859 --> 39:05.696
I'm from India. I know how to do this!

39:05.763 --> 39:07.765
We'll pitch a tent on that
vacant lot down the street,

39:07.832 --> 39:10.901
invite four or five hundred people,

39:10.968 --> 39:13.871
and have the bride and
groom ride in on elephants.

39:13.938 --> 39:17.908
Oh, that would be fun, wouldn't it?

39:17.975 --> 39:21.779
But no, I don't think we'll
get 'em to go along with that.

39:21.846 --> 39:24.682
And who are the four or five
hundred people we'd invite?

39:24.749 --> 39:25.750
Probably had a hundred
children through here.

39:25.816 --> 39:29.654
Let's invite all of them and
all their adoptive families,

39:29.720 --> 39:31.856
and what about your
family back in New York?

39:31.922 --> 39:34.558
Wouldn't your aunts, your mom's
sisters, like to see Ricky and Amy

39:34.625 --> 39:35.893
wearing those wedding bands?

39:35.960 --> 39:39.730
Well, that would be nice, but they
hate to travel. They won't fly.

39:39.797 --> 39:43.797
We never spend any money. This is my only
son's wedding. We'll have them driven out.

39:45.870 --> 39:48.806
Oh, It'd be nice to see them.

39:48.873 --> 39:50.675
And, you know, they've never met Ricky.

39:51.642 --> 39:52.910
Then you will see them.

39:52.977 --> 39:55.713
So, are you going to be
bringing your family over, too?

39:57.682 --> 39:59.684
Let's not go crazy.

39:59.750 --> 40:02.787
It's your mother, isn't it?
She still doesn't like me.

40:02.853 --> 40:05.723
She'll come around. After 20 years?

40:05.790 --> 40:07.692
We didn't have a
wedding. She was insulted.

40:08.693 --> 40:10.695
Well.

40:10.761 --> 40:12.763
We'll definitely have to get
her over here for this one.

40:17.868 --> 40:19.937
Yeah, hi. I was wondering
how much would it be

40:20.004 --> 40:24.004
to, like, have a dinner at your
restaurant for, say, a dozen people.

40:26.811 --> 40:30.811
To start? I don't know. A green
salad. Yeah. I'll go with that.

40:33.718 --> 40:34.552
Choice of dressings?

40:34.618 --> 40:38.618
Yeah, give 'em a choice.
Oh! And we'll need some meat.

40:39.790 --> 40:42.727
Maybe chicken or something
that tastes like chicken.

40:42.793 --> 40:46.793
Dessert. Yeah, we'll need
dessert. Okay, cake. That's great.

40:49.800 --> 40:53.738
Just a small, very small
wedding cake. That's everything.

40:56.841 --> 41:00.841
What! Are you kidding me? Forget
it. They're already married, anyway!

41:01.646 --> 41:02.813
