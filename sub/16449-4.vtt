WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:05.546
Hang on, hang on -
you're not supposed to be here either?

00:05.881 --> 00:07.507
You're a mistake, just like me?

00:07.549 --> 00:08.883
Yeah, and I'm freaking out, dog!

00:08.926 --> 00:11.802
There's so much thoughts in my brain
it's like my head is filled with rocks.

00:12.596 --> 00:15.056
How have you managed
to stay undiscovered?

00:15.098 --> 00:18.684
Because I have had to dodge and weave
and barely escape with my life

00:18.727 --> 00:23.231
and you don't seem... like a super genius.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.568
Hello, Jianyu, I'm Michael.

00:27.611 --> 00:32.698
Before we start, I know you were
a Buddhist monk and kept a vow of silence.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.284
Would you prefer
to remain silent here, as well?

00:37.120 --> 00:39.580
You literally haven't said a word
since we got here?

00:39.623 --> 00:43.084
Yeah. When I say I'm meditating,
I'm just trying to figure out

00:43.126 --> 00:44.335
what the fork is happening!

00:44.378 --> 00:46.045
I think we might be in an alien zoo.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.338
Or on a prank show.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.215
No, Jianyu, we're dead.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.133
Whoa, that's a dope prank.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.510
Whew, gotta give it up.

00:52.553 --> 00:57.390
Okay. I need to make sure
that this isn't some sort of weird trap.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.350
Is your real name "Jianyu?"

00:59.393 --> 01:01.185
No, it's Jason Mendoza.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.771
And, by the way,
everyone here thinks I'm Taiwanese.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.440
I'm Filipino. That's racist.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.817
Heaven is so racist!

01:07.859 --> 01:10.361
But Tahani said that you helped Michael

01:10.404 --> 01:14.115
by putting your hand on his chest
and doing some sort of healing magic?

01:14.157 --> 01:18.536
Yeah, a nurse did that to calm me down once,
when I crashed my jet ski into a manatee.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.913
You crashed your jet ski into a manatee?

01:20.956 --> 01:23.874
Yeah. I'm from Jacksonville, Florida.
It happens a lot.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.002
What did you do for a living?

01:26.044 --> 01:28.379
I was an amateur DJ.
specialising in EDM.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.172
Electronic Dance Music?

01:30.549 --> 01:32.842
I was also an amateur
hip-hop backup dancer

01:32.884 --> 01:35.970
an amateur body spray inventor,
um... I did pranks on Vine...

01:36.013 --> 01:37.179
None of those are jobs.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.389
What did you do to make money?

01:38.432 --> 01:40.391
Oh, I sold fake drugs to college kids.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.185
Okay. Good.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.104
Okay, here's my biggest question.

01:45.147 --> 01:48.691
How did you know
that I didn't belong here?

01:48.734 --> 01:55.114
I figured it out the very first night,
at the party, using my powers of deduction.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.074
I heard you don't talk.

01:57.117 --> 02:02.455
Well here's something for you
to not talk about - I don't belong here!

02:02.497 --> 02:07.168
They made a mistake.
Total phony. So, shh!

02:09.254 --> 02:11.213
Okay. Later, man.

02:12.049 --> 02:15.051
Okay, I vaguely remember that.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.970
I believe you, Jason.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.597
You're not supposed to be here.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.682
Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.150
Hello, Tahani!

02:31.526 --> 02:33.027
Oh! Hello, Michael!

02:33.070 --> 02:36.405
I was just picking out some fresh orchids
for my nightly orchid bath.

02:36.448 --> 02:40.618
So, Tahani, one of your fellow residents
is opening a new restaurant tonight.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.329
This Neighbourhood could use
a real morale boost -

02:43.372 --> 02:45.456
and since you're an expert
at event planning

02:45.499 --> 02:47.833
I was hoping that you would help
with the Grand Opening.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.794
Oh, Michael! Say no more!

02:49.836 --> 02:51.671
I wasn't going to! I was done!

02:51.713 --> 02:54.507
Well, good! Because of course I will.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.800
Janet?
- Hi there.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.093
Oh! Hello, darling.

02:57.135 --> 03:00.888
I would like to model tonight's event
on my most successful gala.

03:00.931 --> 03:06.268
That would be 2006 fundraiser
for stem cell research in Barcelona.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.020
"Barthelona," actually.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.897
Oh, it was a perfect evening.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.316
Princess Stephanie was there,
as were Posh and Becks.

03:12.776 --> 03:16.278
You know, International Sophisticate
Magazine gave us five Gwyneths!

03:17.406 --> 03:20.324
Tonight I'm going to select
my jauntiest suit.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.119
And I may even wear suspenders.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.120
Ah!

03:24.162 --> 03:26.914
It's one of the human clothing items
I'm most eager to try.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.666
Oh. Well, good luck.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.543
Thank you, yes, yes.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.670
I'm excited and... a little nervous.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.005
I'd say that I'm "cautiously optimistic."

03:36.133 --> 03:38.342
I hope I don't chicken out
at the last second.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.928
Sorry, we are talking
about suspenders, right?

03:40.971 --> 03:42.596
Like, these?

03:43.098 --> 03:44.306
You can do that with them?

03:44.349 --> 03:46.016
Oh! I cannot wait!

03:46.643 --> 03:47.560
Excellent.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.812
So Tahani has no idea about me?

03:50.147 --> 03:53.190
No. She thinks I'm a monk,
and she thinks you're her best friend.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.942
Great. I mean, for us.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.402
That's a huge bummer for her.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.488
We need some place
that we can talk in private.

03:59.531 --> 04:00.531
I agree.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.284
Let me show you my bud-hole.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.370
What?
- I should warn you, it's a little messy.

04:09.833 --> 04:10.875
This is my Bud-Hole.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.587
It's just like a hole where me
and my buds can hang out.

04:14.629 --> 04:18.132
Oh! "Bud-hole." Okay, now I get it.

04:18.467 --> 04:21.302
I wrote down on a piece of paper
that I needed a private "meditation area."

04:21.845 --> 04:23.053
Tahani will never come in.

04:24.139 --> 04:27.224
Pretty unique decorating style
you have here, Jianyu.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.145
It's like, "12 year-old boy"
meets "13 year-old boy."

04:31.188 --> 04:34.607
Thanks! Janet helped me get all this stuff.
She rules.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.818
Is she single?
Or is she married to Michael?

04:37.861 --> 04:40.070
No, no, dude. You cannot date Janet.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.530
"A," she's not human

04:41.573 --> 04:44.825
and "B," you have to keep pretending
to be Tahani's soulmate.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.536
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.122
Okay, just sit tight, dude.
I have a class to get to.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.665
What? A... a class?

04:52.125 --> 04:54.168
I... I didn't know there were classes!
I was sick.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.128
I have a note.
- No, no, no.

04:56.171 --> 05:00.466
Chidi is trying to teach me
to be a good person, and it's really hard.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.302
Also, Michael has asked me to be
his "assistant," whatever that means.

05:03.345 --> 05:06.514
My whole situation here is getting
like more and more dicey.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.684
So I'm actually really glad to have a place
I can come when I just want to be myself.

05:11.228 --> 05:15.439
Yeah. I miss being myself.
Myself was the best.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.781
Whoo!

05:27.619 --> 05:29.078
What's up, man? You Jason?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.080
You got two minutes.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.208
Fred Durst is throwing an orgy
on a partially capsized yacht.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.418
My dad just texted, it already started.

05:36.461 --> 05:40.172
So I'll get right to the point,
I listened to your demo. You're terrible.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.758
Really?
- Yeah.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.718
Okay, you just don't have any...

05:44.761 --> 05:46.762
what's the word? Talent.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.598
But don't worry, you got something
better than talent, man.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.767
You got my approximate size and weight.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.228
I'm supposed to play this club
for the rest of the week

05:54.271 --> 05:57.022
but I just got an offer
to DJ Scott Disick's afterparty

05:57.065 --> 05:58.858
for the Amateur Porn Awards in Reno.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.527
Whoa! Congrats, bro! That's the dream!

06:01.570 --> 06:03.195
It's your dream, man. It's my Tuesday.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.738
I just need somebody to fill in.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.157
Put on the helmet,
press "space bar" on the computer -

06:07.200 --> 06:08.534
those idiots
won't know the difference.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.996
For the next week,
Jason, you are "Acidcat."

06:13.999 --> 06:16.584
Whoa! There's a lot
of old gum in here!

06:18.086 --> 06:20.004
Tahani! How are things going
in the front of the house?

06:20.046 --> 06:23.257
Because to be perfectly frank,
things in the kitchen are going great!

06:23.300 --> 06:25.426
Okay, I am right on schedule!

06:25.927 --> 06:29.388
Chef Patricia, I have triple-checked
every single detail.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.808
Your restaurant opening is going to be
the talk of the entire Neighbourhood!

06:33.226 --> 06:35.144
Thank you for your thoughtfulness
and hard work!

06:35.186 --> 06:37.021
I could not have done this without you!

06:37.063 --> 06:38.314
Ah! Hello, Tahani.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.525
Sorry, I should've warned you.

06:42.152 --> 06:46.530
Patricia is actually very happy
but she's also very intense.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.781
It can be confusing.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.700
No, no, no, that's not
what's bothering me.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.868
It's just that, well...

06:51.369 --> 06:54.538
I looked at the guest list earlier
and Jianyu isn't invited?

06:55.457 --> 06:56.332
Right.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.834
Jianyu is a beautiful spirit.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.045
But he literally doesn't talk.

07:01.504 --> 07:04.298
And since this will be
an evening of lively conversation

07:04.758 --> 07:06.050
and you'll be busy working,

07:06.676 --> 07:08.510
I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.471
I totally understand.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.431
Well-reasoned, Michael.

07:12.474 --> 07:17.102
As us Brits are fond of saying,
"Try your best to hide your sadness."

07:19.606 --> 07:24.652
So the concept of the "self"
is a key subject for a lot of great thinkers.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.612
In the Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu wrote -

07:27.238 --> 07:30.324
"Knowing others is wisdom.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.494
But knowing the self is enlightenment."

07:33.536 --> 07:35.913
Ah! "Knowing yourself?"

07:36.414 --> 07:39.041
Is he talking about
what I think he's talking about?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.168
No, Eleanor, once again

07:41.211 --> 07:44.838
none of these philosophers
is ever talking about masturbation.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.342
Let's, uh... move on
to this week's main event...

07:49.427 --> 07:51.720
David Hume's
"A Treatise of Human Nature."

07:51.763 --> 07:53.389
You read this, right?
- I did.

07:53.682 --> 07:54.848
Well, I tried to.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.475
Well, I tried to want to.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.144
Um, actually,
could we postpone this lesson?

07:59.521 --> 08:03.983
I've befriended Jianyu from next door,
and I thought I could learn from him.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.567
That's a great idea.

08:05.610 --> 08:09.488
Hume's "bundle theory" of the self
is fairly close to Buddhism.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.408
Yeah, no "durr!"
That's why I'm doing it.

08:14.911 --> 08:15.911
Do you hear music?

08:16.371 --> 08:17.663
That's not music.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.375
That's EDM!

08:25.547 --> 08:26.588
What are you doing?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.465
Eleanor, you were right!

08:28.508 --> 08:30.676
No more pretending!
It's time for me to be myself!

08:31.344 --> 08:32.219
What's up, homey?

08:32.971 --> 08:35.347
Eleanor? You broke Jianyu!

08:40.437 --> 08:42.187
Okay, did we miss anything?

08:42.230 --> 08:44.148
Ugh! Take that jersey off,
you goofball!

08:45.400 --> 08:47.443
Okay. This is not my fault, I swear.

08:47.485 --> 08:51.030
Eleanor, one hour ago,
that man was a silent Buddhist monk!

08:51.072 --> 08:52.823
Right, but here's the thing.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.616
Jianyu is actually...

08:54.659 --> 08:57.870
a guy who is nice! Hi, Tahani!

08:58.121 --> 09:00.289
Eleanor! Chidi! What a lovely surprise.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.291
Don't mind me, I'm just dropping off
my afternoon gloves

09:02.333 --> 09:04.084
and picking up my early evening gloves.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.587
How are you, soulmate?
- I'm cool.

09:09.716 --> 09:14.970
I'm sorry, am I going mad
or did I just hear you say, "I'm cool?"

09:15.013 --> 09:17.514
Mmm. Mm-mm. I don't think so.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.433
I don't think that happened.
You're... you're wrong.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.685
Oh, I see what's going here.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.646
You've got a Whisper
in your Snicker box!

09:25.231 --> 09:29.026
You're both helping Jianyu
to regain his confidence

09:29.069 --> 09:30.819
to be able to speak again!

09:31.362 --> 09:34.990
As a surprise for me!
- Oh, busted.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.785
My heart is soaring!

09:39.412 --> 09:42.164
So Jianyu is talking? Oh, how wonderful!

09:42.624 --> 09:45.209
I will do everything in my power
to encourage him.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.251
Well, not everything.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.754
I won't give him a second mouth -
unless that would be helpful?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.297
No. Better not risk it.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.924
I've actually had a better idea.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.676
Oh!
- Let's add Jianyu to the guest list.

09:54.886 --> 09:56.470
Chidi and Eleanor
have been working with him

09:56.513 --> 09:58.222
and they're going to be here.
- What a great idea!

09:58.264 --> 10:00.849
Patricia?
We can fit another chair, right?

10:01.309 --> 10:04.228
Change the floor plan?
An hour before opening?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.272
Of course! The more the merrier!

10:08.108 --> 10:09.108
Oh, hurrah!

10:09.359 --> 10:13.612
I knew tonight was going to be perfect,
but now it is going to be even perfect-er!

10:14.072 --> 10:17.282
Obviously, it's impossible for something
to be more perfect than perfect.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.493
Well, it isn't, actually.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.287
Any place or thing in the universe

10:22.372 --> 10:26.333
can be up to one hundred
and four percent perfect.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.626
That's how you got Beyoncé.

10:27.669 --> 10:28.669
Oh!

10:30.630 --> 10:33.882
Oh. "Bud-hole."

10:34.300 --> 10:36.135
Okay. Now, tell me everything.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.513
Okay. Jianyu is a fraud

10:40.265 --> 10:41.140
just like me.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.349
His real name is Jason.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.977
He's a drug-dealing DJ from Florida.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.105
It's gonna be fine. We just need a plan.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.857
Oh, I got a plan.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.984
We hack into Michael's phone

10:52.235 --> 10:55.612
download all his nudes,
and then blackmail him.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.906
No. What are you ta-- No!

10:57.949 --> 10:59.575
Yo, you should listen to me!

10:59.617 --> 11:01.160
I came up with hundreds
of plans in my life

11:01.202 --> 11:02.494
and only one of them got me killed.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.204
Dude! Be quiet!

11:04.247 --> 11:07.207
You are not Jason. You are a monk
named Jianyu.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.417
Got it?

11:17.135 --> 11:19.011
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

11:19.637 --> 11:21.638
Dude, another great set, Jason.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.723
They love you, dude!

11:23.183 --> 11:25.809
They don't love me, man.
They love Acidcat.

11:26.561 --> 11:27.686
These cheers are fake.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.106
They hit my ears
like boxing gloves of sadness.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.526
Whoa.
That's some poetic thoughts, "B."

11:34.986 --> 11:36.028
I gotta be myself!

11:41.534 --> 11:43.493
Attention Jacksonville.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.037
I'm not Acidcat.

11:47.040 --> 11:52.711
I'm Mr Music, the DJ.
And this is a Mr Music, the DJ original!

11:52.962 --> 11:54.421
"NO!"
- Pow!

12:11.022 --> 12:13.649
Welcome to the opening
of "The Good Plates".

12:16.861 --> 12:17.736
I just got that.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.863
That's hilarious!

12:20.448 --> 12:22.491
Anyway, at some point or another

12:22.533 --> 12:27.829
every resident in this Neighbourhood
will fulfill his or her soul's true purpose.

12:27.872 --> 12:32.960
Chef Patricia has done that tonight,
by opening this restaurant!

12:34.921 --> 12:38.340
Now, if you'd all like
to take a look at tonight's menus.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.593
That's right!

12:41.761 --> 12:42.928
With Michael's help

12:43.012 --> 12:47.140
Chef Patricia has recreated
each person's favourite meal on Earth!

12:47.183 --> 12:48.392
Fun!

12:56.484 --> 12:57.943
It's my Grandmother's maafe!

12:58.861 --> 13:01.238
Fresh perch, slow roasted
in a peanut sauce.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.825
Almost makes me forget
how miserable I am right now.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.785
You want to try a bite?

13:06.828 --> 13:07.911
Fish and peanut butter?

13:07.954 --> 13:08.954
No, I'm good, thanks.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.749
Tofu? Aw, man!

13:12.792 --> 13:14.084
I'm ordering some jalapeño poppers.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.336
Shh! Be quiet and eat your white sponge.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.883
Janet?
- Hi, there.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.468
Hi. I didn't get a meal.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.594
According to our files

13:24.637 --> 13:27.889
your favourite "meal" was
the hunger strike you went on

13:27.932 --> 13:30.267
to protest Bolivian sex trafficking.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.145
Oh, right. Of course I did that.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.064
Tahani? Great party.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.691
Check it out.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.692
Oh!
- Suspenders!

13:39.527 --> 13:42.154
So dumb.
So much dumber than belts.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.615
Ah, congratulations, Michael.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.826
How's Jianyu doing?
Is he opening up?

13:48.202 --> 13:51.288
Mmm... not yet.
But I can tell he wants to.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.123
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.417
May I have your attention please?

13:56.210 --> 13:57.461
Later this evening,

13:57.503 --> 14:00.464
we will be enjoying
Chef Patricia's delicious dessert -

14:00.506 --> 14:05.093
a stunning, three-tiered cake
that took her a full week to complete.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.220
But first, I'd like to try something fun.

14:07.597 --> 14:11.850
Each one of you has a very special memory
attached to the meal you're eating.

14:12.477 --> 14:15.437
Why don't we go around the room
and share our stories?

14:15.688 --> 14:16.688
Who'd like to begin?

14:18.483 --> 14:20.359
I'll start, Michael!

14:21.611 --> 14:24.112
One day, I wasn't feeling so great

14:24.155 --> 14:27.991
so I made myself
a bowl of this chicken soup...

14:28.409 --> 14:31.661
When it gets to you, say something short
and boring about tofu.

14:31.704 --> 14:35.832
No! I'm sick of pretending
to be Jianyu the tofu man.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.460
I'm gonna tell the story
about my real favourite meal.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.544
Which is?

14:39.587 --> 14:42.672
The Buffalo wings at Stupid Nick's
Wing Dump in Gainesville.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.258
Wings were free for ladies
if they took their top off!

14:45.301 --> 14:47.886
Oh, boy. Chidi? A word?

14:48.262 --> 14:52.933
Anyway, that's how this simple soup
saved over ten thousand lives.

14:55.395 --> 14:59.356
If Jianyu starts talking about topless
buffalo wing restaurants, we're all screwed!

14:59.399 --> 15:00.982
Well maybe we should just let him talk.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.359
He says he doesn't want to hide anymore.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.777
He doesn't know what he wants.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.946
He's an idiot from Florida.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.447
He's a "Floridiot."

15:07.698 --> 15:12.661
Jianyu Li, Taiwanese monk who took
a vow of silence at the age of eight

15:13.246 --> 15:16.498
and hasn't spoken since,
is ready to share with us.

15:20.461 --> 15:24.506
Let me tell you about Stupid Nick.

15:26.509 --> 15:29.469
We need a distraction!
Right the fork now!

15:31.973 --> 15:33.849
No, no, no, no! Eleanor!

15:33.891 --> 15:36.101
Chef Patricia poured her heart
and soul into this.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.061
Destroying it would be
a truly cruel act.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.522
Yeah, no "durr."
- No, no, no!

15:51.284 --> 15:54.870
Sinkhole!
Everyone out, there's a sinkhole!

15:58.541 --> 15:59.749
Glenn!

16:00.209 --> 16:02.335
You broke the world!

16:03.129 --> 16:04.421
It's not a compliment!

16:07.925 --> 16:09.718
Glenn? Stay calm!

16:09.760 --> 16:11.178
We're gonna get you out of there!

16:11.220 --> 16:14.181
And we'll put your soup in the fridge,
so it won't go to waste!

16:16.267 --> 16:19.478
I know that may not be
your number one concern right now, but...

16:19.520 --> 16:21.938
It was up there. It's real good soup!

16:22.273 --> 16:23.190
Let's go.

16:24.901 --> 16:25.609
Hey, buddy!

16:26.110 --> 16:27.152
You okay?

16:27.653 --> 16:30.572
No. I was just about to tell
an awesome story

16:30.615 --> 16:32.532
about a wing-eating contest
that I lost

16:32.992 --> 16:34.868
and a barfing contest that I won

16:34.911 --> 16:36.703
but then a hole opened up in the ground!

16:36.746 --> 16:40.040
I know. I made the hole,
to save you from yourself.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.293
You cannot let people know
who you really are.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.213
It would be very, very bad.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.510
Beautiful, beautiful Jacksonville.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.889
What's wrong, dog?
You look like you're freaking out.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.891
Things are bad, Pillboi.

16:58.226 --> 17:01.478
Acidcat is suing me
for "bleach of contract."

17:01.771 --> 17:03.813
I should have never pretended
to be someone else.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.857
It could cost me
all my dreams in life.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.443
You got dreams in life?
That's lit!

17:08.694 --> 17:10.237
Course I have dreams, man!

17:10.780 --> 17:12.864
I don't want to be a DJ
in Jacksonville forever.

17:14.033 --> 17:18.954
I want to DJ in Daytona,
Tallahassee, Tampa, even.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.539
I want it all.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.749
That's big goals, man.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.126
I know. But I believe in myself.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.129
Someday, the world will see
what I already know -

17:28.673 --> 17:33.301
that Jason Mendoza
is a beautiful, unique soul

17:33.844 --> 17:35.762
who has so much to give this world.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.517
Okay, that's Acidcat's speedboat.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.476
Hand me the thing that blows it up.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.437
That's lit.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.699
Michael, I hereby tender my resignation.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.743
I can no longer, in good conscience,
coordinate any further events

17:58.786 --> 18:01.997
in the Good Place,
so I am turning in my evening gloves.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.499
Tahani...
- Don't try to make me feel better.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.668
The launch was a disaster.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.130
Poor Jianyu was so terrified
that I fear he may never speak again.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.591
My hair is barely
cascading down my shoulders!

18:12.633 --> 18:13.925
Tahani, please.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.221
I know your journey
with Jianyu has been frustrating.

18:18.806 --> 18:22.017
But your situation is actually very typical.

18:22.393 --> 18:25.437
Soulmates sometimes
take months to really click.

18:25.730 --> 18:26.896
You have to be patient.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.234
And if anyone should take the blame
for the restaurant disaster, it's me.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.029
I thought this Neighbourhood's
troubles were behind us.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.197
Now I fear the worst.

18:37.074 --> 18:37.991
Michael.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.369
I hereby rescind
the tendering of my resignation.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.079
We must keep
the Neighbourhood together.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.247
What can I do?

18:44.290 --> 18:48.001
Oh! Well, the sinkhole should be
repairing itself in about three days.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.128
Well, as soon as it does,
we shall relaunch the restaurant!

18:50.796 --> 18:52.672
I'll hang posters to get the word out.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.675
And in the meantime,
I'll host a brunch party, every morning,

18:55.718 --> 18:56.926
to lift people's spirits.

18:57.303 --> 19:01.473
While you "re-pair" the universe,
I shall "pre-pare" the eggs!

19:01.515 --> 19:03.308
Oh! Fanciful wordplay!

19:03.351 --> 19:06.811
Indeed! That is the Tahani
that you know and love!

19:09.565 --> 19:10.690
So what do we do, here?

19:10.733 --> 19:11.816
There's nothing to do.

19:12.443 --> 19:16.196
He's just gonna blab and get him
and me both sent to the Bad Place.

19:16.739 --> 19:17.656
It's hopeless.

19:21.786 --> 19:27.290
Can't believe I'm doing this but,
Jason, please come to my classroom.

19:27.875 --> 19:31.419
I will teach you ethics,
like I'm doing with Eleanor

19:31.504 --> 19:34.172
and if you work hard
and absorb the material

19:34.715 --> 19:36.549
you just might be able
to earn your place here.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.221
Nah, I'm good.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.935
Dude! Chidi is giving you a lifeline
right now and you need to take it.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.395
Because you suck!

19:48.646 --> 19:50.730
You suck!
- I know!

19:51.273 --> 19:52.899
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.026
We both suck!
You know who doesn't suck?

19:55.695 --> 19:59.072
Chidi. He is putting himself
in danger to help us

19:59.115 --> 20:02.117
because he, unlike us,
is an amazing person.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.328
I didn't get into heaven
to go to school.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.498
You didn't get into heaven at all,
shirt for brains!

20:08.582 --> 20:09.708
I just want to be myself.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.876
That's a very, very bad idea.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.461
Do not be yourself.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.089
You need to be a better version
of yourself, okay?

20:16.132 --> 20:17.340
And I do, too.

20:17.383 --> 20:21.553
And our only hope right now
is this kind, selfless, amazing nerd.

20:21.804 --> 20:22.971
Think about that.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.806
Eh, do you have to call me
a "nerd" so much?

20:24.849 --> 20:26.933
I said a lot of other nice things,
okay?

20:26.976 --> 20:27.892
Toughen up, nerd.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.773
Let's get cracking, teach!

20:34.358 --> 20:37.152
I read this entire David Hume book,
and then I read it again

20:37.194 --> 20:39.612
because I didn't understand it
the first time, and now I'm ready to go!

20:39.947 --> 20:43.533
Wow. Uh, that's really impressive.
Uh, where's Jianyu?

20:44.118 --> 20:45.660
Honestly, I don't even know
if he's coming.

20:47.329 --> 20:50.039
I am here to learn about "ethnics".

20:51.751 --> 20:53.710
Wow! That's great, man!

20:54.128 --> 20:56.629
Um, I mean, it's "ethics"
but that's great.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.006
Pretty sure it's "ethnics."

20:58.424 --> 21:00.467
Hey, buddy? I'm proud of you.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.261
This is your first step
towards not sucking.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.722
Cool. I just have two questions.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.976
When are football tryouts,
and does this school have a prom?

21:10.811 --> 21:13.605
Oh, no.
- Oh, wow.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.984
For the first time ever,
I'm the smartest kid in class.
