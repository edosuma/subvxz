WEBVTT

00:10.023 --> 00:11.657
Hey, guys?

00:11.691 --> 00:13.659
One, two, three, go!

00:15.161 --> 00:16.662
Ah!

00:16.696 --> 00:17.663
Head wigglies!

00:17.697 --> 00:18.764
Guys... I win!

00:18.798 --> 00:20.100
Head wigglies?

00:20.133 --> 00:21.167
Head wigglies.

00:21.201 --> 00:22.835
When you drink something cold
too fast

00:22.868 --> 00:24.604
and your head gets all wiggly.

00:24.637 --> 00:27.140
You Brits have baby talk
for everything. Guys...

00:27.173 --> 00:29.242
Telly, lorry, willy, nappy, bobby!
Guys.

00:29.275 --> 00:31.677
Well, you have very silly things
in your vocabulary as well.

00:31.711 --> 00:32.677
Like what?

00:32.712 --> 00:34.247
"American exceptionalism."

00:34.280 --> 00:35.748
Nice.

00:35.781 --> 00:36.916
Former colony burn.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.018
Guys!

00:38.051 --> 00:39.319
What is it?! Excuse me!

00:39.352 --> 00:40.362
You are being exceedingly rude.
Can't you see

00:40.386 --> 00:41.663
that we're in
the middle of something?

00:41.687 --> 00:43.423
This is the fifth night
in a row.

00:43.456 --> 00:45.158
Can you pack it in
for the night?

00:45.191 --> 00:46.259
No can do, Hoss.

00:46.292 --> 00:47.760
Jimmy's never seen House Party.

00:47.793 --> 00:49.362
Really? Yeah.

00:49.395 --> 00:50.796
Somehow the House Party series

00:50.830 --> 00:53.433
wasn't popular
in my scorchingly racist,

00:53.466 --> 00:55.101
industrial lead-mining
neighborhood.

00:55.135 --> 00:56.869
He thinks Play's the villain.

00:56.902 --> 00:58.771
Ah, no, actually, I have updated

00:58.804 --> 01:01.641
my archetypal dramatis personae
since act one.

01:01.674 --> 01:03.376
Play is the Sage.

01:03.409 --> 01:05.045
Mm. Kid is the Seeker,

01:05.078 --> 01:07.180
Stab is the Villain
and Martin Lawrence is the Fool.

01:07.213 --> 01:09.049
I have to be at work
really early.

01:09.082 --> 01:10.816
Are you talking
about making me breakfast?

01:10.850 --> 01:13.153
'Cause I wouldn't call
10:00 a.m. "really early."

01:13.186 --> 01:14.887
I work at the gym.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.023
Oh, no, Edgar,

01:17.057 --> 01:19.459
we call it
"working out" at the gym.

01:19.492 --> 01:20.693
Do you really have a job?

01:20.726 --> 01:22.362
Yes! I wipe down machines

01:22.395 --> 01:25.465
and I monitor the men's showers
for roughhousing.

01:25.498 --> 01:26.532
Do you know what?

01:26.566 --> 01:28.968
I haven't been
taking into account

01:29.001 --> 01:30.246
what an adjustment
it must be for you,

01:30.270 --> 01:31.671
having Gretchen living here now.

01:31.704 --> 01:32.914
We should all learn
to compromise.

01:32.938 --> 01:34.574
Thank you.

01:34.607 --> 01:36.542
So let's put it to a house vote.

01:36.576 --> 01:38.578
On the floor is the question:

01:38.611 --> 01:40.846
Should we have a curfew
on weeknights?

01:40.880 --> 01:42.014
Those in favor?

01:43.116 --> 01:44.484
Those in opposition?

01:44.517 --> 01:45.485
Ah.

01:45.518 --> 01:47.220
The cold,

01:47.253 --> 01:49.155
egalitarian hand
of Lady Democracy

01:49.189 --> 01:50.323
has triumphed

01:50.356 --> 01:51.691
once again.

01:51.724 --> 01:52.858
God save the Queen.

01:52.892 --> 01:54.260
God save the Queen.

02:16.216 --> 02:18.284
Here we go.

02:18.318 --> 02:21.053
Breakfast lasagna.

02:21.087 --> 02:22.355
No thanks. Not hungry.

02:22.388 --> 02:23.856
But you guys are always hungry.

02:23.889 --> 02:25.425
Too hungover.

02:25.458 --> 02:26.859
Also, we ate at, like, what,

02:26.892 --> 02:28.027
5:00 a.m.? Mm.

02:28.060 --> 02:29.529
I made Bagel Bites.

02:29.562 --> 02:32.965
Well, since I made
all this lasagna,

02:32.998 --> 02:34.867
maybe we should
have Lindsay over.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.403
She loves a breakfast lasagna.

02:38.438 --> 02:40.806
Dogs don't eat nachos.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.408
Plus, we're all so worried

02:42.442 --> 02:44.877
about how she's doing
with the whole

02:44.910 --> 02:46.546
- Paul breakup.
- She's fine.

02:46.579 --> 02:48.214
I'm seeing her later.
Okay, well, then,

02:48.248 --> 02:49.382
uh, give her my love.

02:49.415 --> 02:50.816
Well, not like "my love,"

02:50.850 --> 02:53.253
just like, "S'up?
Hang in there, kid."

02:53.286 --> 02:55.006
You know. Something chill
and friendly-like.

02:55.921 --> 02:57.757
My Uber driver called,
like, six times

02:57.790 --> 03:00.092
and it didn't even ring!

03:02.195 --> 03:03.396
Salvatore!

03:03.429 --> 03:04.830
Salvatore?!

03:04.864 --> 03:06.065
Is he out there?

03:06.098 --> 03:07.567
No.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.335
But the Zoiddle car
just drove past

03:09.369 --> 03:11.171
with all its stupid cameras.

03:11.204 --> 03:13.339
Shoot!
I should have flashed him.

03:13.373 --> 03:15.408
I hate the Zoiddle car. Why?

03:15.441 --> 03:16.776
It's a violation.

03:16.809 --> 03:18.444
Putting my house on the Internet

03:18.478 --> 03:20.112
for any of
my obsessive fans to see.

03:20.146 --> 03:21.847
Hello? Can you hear me?

03:21.881 --> 03:23.916
What's the address here?

03:23.949 --> 03:25.518
You don't know the address?

03:25.551 --> 03:27.019
No. You live here.

03:27.052 --> 03:28.254
Who knows their address?

03:28.288 --> 03:29.589
People.

03:29.622 --> 03:31.090
Kidnapped children.

03:31.123 --> 03:34.093
This dog I saw on Dateline
who rides the bus to the park.

03:34.126 --> 03:37.363
696969th Street.

03:37.397 --> 03:39.632
6969...

03:39.665 --> 03:41.601
Hello?

03:41.634 --> 03:43.269
Damn it! Not again.
You should just get

03:43.303 --> 03:45.037
on Jimmy's plan.
He gets great reception

03:45.070 --> 03:46.682
and a family plan
will probably be cheaper

03:46.706 --> 03:47.640
for both of you anyway.

03:47.673 --> 03:49.141
Ew! Ugh!

03:49.175 --> 03:50.976
Gross. Why don't you
get on a family plan?

03:51.010 --> 03:53.213
Well, I don't have a family.

03:53.246 --> 03:54.647
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.057
Well, you sure you don't want
to take some for the road?

03:56.081 --> 03:57.317
Seriously, thanks.

03:57.350 --> 03:58.818
I couldn't eat another bite.

03:58.851 --> 04:00.220
I'm telling you, Gretch,
I'm great.

04:00.253 --> 04:02.288
Living alone is way fun.

04:02.322 --> 04:05.958
I'm naked all the time,
ass-ing everything.

04:05.991 --> 04:08.828
100%, 24/7 sprawling.

04:08.861 --> 04:10.062
Oh, I love sprawling.

04:10.095 --> 04:11.631
Sprawling is the best.

04:11.664 --> 04:14.467
Sure, Paul messed up
the natural order of things:

04:14.500 --> 04:17.702
Hot awesome sex foxes are
supposed to leave rich nerds,

04:17.737 --> 04:18.904
not the other way around.

04:18.938 --> 04:20.339
But it's okay.

04:20.373 --> 04:22.174
Paul was just too reserved

04:22.208 --> 04:23.976
to be compatible
with someone like me

04:24.009 --> 04:25.978
who just wants to truly live.

04:26.011 --> 04:26.879
And sprawl.

04:26.912 --> 04:27.980
And sprawl, Gretch.

04:28.013 --> 04:28.914
Gotta sprawl.

04:28.948 --> 04:30.316
So you haven't seen him?

04:30.350 --> 04:31.917
He's been busy
planning his new future

04:31.951 --> 04:33.653
with the chat room girl.

04:33.686 --> 04:35.355
Beer cooze? Beer cooze.

04:35.388 --> 04:38.090
Actually, he's coming
by later to drop off his keys.

04:38.123 --> 04:39.259
You want me to be there?

04:39.292 --> 04:40.926
Give him some of my
shitty death stares?

04:40.960 --> 04:42.928
Ooh!

04:42.962 --> 04:44.330
But it's okay.

04:44.364 --> 04:45.665
I'm in a good place about it.

04:45.698 --> 04:46.899
Are you sure? 'Cause I can...

04:48.301 --> 04:49.835
Oh, God.

04:49.869 --> 04:51.103
I'm fine.

04:51.136 --> 04:52.104
It passed.

04:52.137 --> 04:53.339
You look terrible.

04:53.373 --> 04:54.940
Ever since I've been at Jimmy's,

04:54.974 --> 04:56.342
we've been partying nonstop.

04:56.376 --> 04:58.511
If I don't get a night off soon,

04:58.544 --> 05:00.689
I think my liver is gonna
slide out of my body, you know?

05:00.713 --> 05:02.181
No, Gretch.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.182
I don't know.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.884
What? You can't stop.

05:04.917 --> 05:06.286
But I'm tired.

05:06.319 --> 05:07.687
Were you born yesterday?

05:07.720 --> 05:09.722
Did you slither
out of your mother's cooch

05:09.755 --> 05:11.190
yesterday, Gretchen?

05:11.223 --> 05:13.559
Are you a little
born-yesterday diaperface?

05:13.593 --> 05:15.194
Why are you being so mean to me?

05:15.227 --> 05:18.298
"Yesterday I was safe
in my mommy's tummy

05:18.331 --> 05:20.065
"and then I got borned

05:20.099 --> 05:22.802
and the world is so cold
and hard. Wah!"

05:22.835 --> 05:25.738
I just want to drink tea
and read a book and be cozy.

05:25.771 --> 05:27.640
You shut the hell up! Lindser!

05:27.673 --> 05:28.874
In the early days,

05:28.908 --> 05:30.643
Paul and I used
to have actual fun.

05:30.676 --> 05:33.212
Then, pretty soon,
it was laptops in bed,

05:33.245 --> 05:34.647
lights out at 10:00

05:34.680 --> 05:36.392
and next thing you knew,
I was calling him "the hubs"

05:36.416 --> 05:37.793
and he could only finish
in my hand.

05:37.817 --> 05:38.884
What?

05:38.918 --> 05:41.053
There comes a day
when every relationship

05:41.086 --> 05:43.389
turns gross, old and boring.

05:43.423 --> 05:45.224
Like Ben Affleck
and Jennifer "Gardener."

05:45.257 --> 05:46.959
Don't puss out this early.

05:46.992 --> 05:49.762
Keep it awesome
for as long as you can.

05:49.795 --> 05:51.263
I know.

05:51.297 --> 05:52.565
Do butt stuff tonight!

05:52.598 --> 05:54.334
But I don't want to do
butt stuff tonight.

05:54.767 --> 05:55.901
Ow!

05:55.935 --> 05:57.437
You go home tonight

05:57.470 --> 05:59.339
and you dress up real slutty,

05:59.372 --> 06:01.474
and you do butt stuff
with your boyfriend.

06:01.507 --> 06:02.808
For all of us

06:02.842 --> 06:05.645
who let love die
by becoming ordinary.

06:05.678 --> 06:07.480
Do it for
the sweater people, Gretch.

06:07.513 --> 06:09.815
The sweater people.

06:09.849 --> 06:11.584
Wait.
You wear sweaters all the time.

06:11.617 --> 06:12.818
It's a metaphor.

06:16.622 --> 06:18.358
Hey. Hey.

06:18.391 --> 06:19.525
I got your emergency text.

06:19.559 --> 06:22.294
Oh, God, that was touch
and go there for a second.

06:23.729 --> 06:25.498
Ah! Head wigglies.

06:25.531 --> 06:28.000
You and Gretchen
should really take it easy.

06:28.033 --> 06:30.002
Absolutely not.

06:30.035 --> 06:31.203
I'm having a blast!

06:32.137 --> 06:33.639
I mean, yeah, I'm peeing blood

06:33.673 --> 06:35.841
and I briefly forgot
the word for telephone,

06:35.875 --> 06:37.810
but just because
we're co-habitating

06:37.843 --> 06:41.847
does not mean that we're gonna
become disgusting normals.

06:41.881 --> 06:44.016
If you don't get some sleep,
you're gonna die.

06:44.049 --> 06:46.118
I died when I was with Becca.

06:46.151 --> 06:47.286
That's when I died.

06:47.319 --> 06:49.321
With Gretchen,
I'm determined to live.

06:53.659 --> 06:55.461
While I'm here...

06:55.495 --> 06:57.563
a friend of mine has a problem.

06:57.597 --> 06:58.498
Is it you?

06:58.531 --> 07:00.299
No, my friend Gabriel,
from work.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.467
You don't have friends.

07:01.501 --> 07:04.404
Is it you?
Anyway, Gabriel likes this girl

07:04.437 --> 07:06.171
who's going through
some life transitions.

07:06.205 --> 07:07.673
Edgar, you're obviously talking

07:07.707 --> 07:08.808
about you and Lindsay.

07:08.841 --> 07:09.975
How did you know?

07:10.009 --> 07:10.976
Well, you've been screaming

07:11.010 --> 07:11.977
her name out in your sleep.

07:12.011 --> 07:13.646
Usually it's things like,

07:13.679 --> 07:15.047
"Get to the chopper!"

07:15.080 --> 07:16.882
or "Where's Rodriguez?"

07:16.916 --> 07:19.084
or "I didn't know
it was a school!"

07:19.118 --> 07:21.053
I didn't know it was a school.

07:21.086 --> 07:22.021
The point is,

07:22.054 --> 07:24.424
if this is about
you and Lindsay,

07:24.457 --> 07:26.692
there is no you and Lindsay.

07:26.726 --> 07:28.160
There's never gonna be.

07:28.193 --> 07:29.094
Never mind.

07:29.128 --> 07:30.168
Can I go back to work now?

07:30.195 --> 07:32.364
You have a job?

07:36.235 --> 07:37.537
Hello, Lindsay.

07:37.570 --> 07:39.338
Paul, you don't have
to be nervous.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.673
I'm fine.

07:40.706 --> 07:41.907
Really?

07:41.941 --> 07:43.943
Okay. Good.

07:43.976 --> 07:45.845
Guess I don't need
this pepper spray.

07:45.878 --> 07:47.613
Here's your mail.

07:47.647 --> 07:49.348
Thank you, madame.

07:51.050 --> 07:54.219
Actually, I brought
a few things for you to sign.

07:54.253 --> 07:55.621
What is it?

07:55.655 --> 07:56.889
Just busywork.

07:56.922 --> 07:59.291
Like this one removes you
from my video store account.

07:59.324 --> 08:02.895
This one,
my hummus of the month club.

08:02.928 --> 08:04.464
This takes you
off the membership

08:04.497 --> 08:07.700
for the Museum
of Prehistoric Metallurgy,

08:07.733 --> 08:10.302
but I bought you your own
individual membership

08:10.335 --> 08:12.472
so there'd be no gap
for you there.

08:18.077 --> 08:20.412
So, how's beer coo...

08:20.446 --> 08:22.281
Amy? Good.

08:22.314 --> 08:24.049
I'm actually flying
to Boulder tomorrow

08:24.083 --> 08:27.052
to meet Amy "I.R.L." for
the first time, in real life.

08:27.086 --> 08:29.221
That's great.

08:29.254 --> 08:32.390
Yeah. That's really great.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.594
You're gonna do a makeover
before you go, right?

08:34.626 --> 08:36.395
What? Oh, nothing.
I just figured

08:36.428 --> 08:38.130
before you met your soul mate

08:38.163 --> 08:40.140
you would want to make sure
you were looking your best.

08:40.164 --> 08:41.734
What? Has your hair

08:41.767 --> 08:43.503
always been so round?

08:43.535 --> 08:45.738
You're right,
she's gonna hate me.

08:45.771 --> 08:48.173
I look like a young Roger Ebert.

08:48.207 --> 08:49.575
Come upstairs.

08:49.609 --> 08:52.344
I'll help you pick out
a couple outfits.

08:52.377 --> 08:53.779
Really? After all,

08:53.813 --> 08:55.014
you got me my own membership

08:55.047 --> 08:56.348
to the place with the old stuff.

08:56.381 --> 08:58.450
Thanks, Lindsay.

09:01.286 --> 09:03.523
This is really mature of you.

09:04.957 --> 09:07.092
Almost...

09:07.126 --> 09:08.193
almost...

09:09.562 --> 09:10.462
I'm ready!

09:10.496 --> 09:11.497
Okay.

09:17.670 --> 09:18.938
Tighter!

09:18.971 --> 09:20.673
Oh, come on, bear. Oh...

09:20.706 --> 09:22.341
Oh, sweet hand.

09:22.374 --> 09:23.776
That's right, Paulywog.

09:23.809 --> 09:24.853
It's happening, it's happening.

09:24.877 --> 09:25.877
Oh...

09:34.820 --> 09:36.556
What the hell am I doing?

09:40.660 --> 09:42.327
Hey.

09:42.361 --> 09:44.296
Hey, yourself, Hunk-face.

09:44.329 --> 09:45.965
What are you wearing?

09:45.998 --> 09:48.868
Just a little something
fun and flirty.

09:48.901 --> 09:51.003
You like?

09:51.036 --> 09:52.471
Yeah, I bet you do.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.239
I thought we could do
butt stuff tonight.

09:54.273 --> 09:57.476
Fantastic!

09:57.509 --> 09:58.811
Yeah, for sure.

09:58.844 --> 10:00.880
We don't have to
if you don't want to.

10:00.913 --> 10:01.814
I mean, I could be fine just...

10:01.847 --> 10:02.815
Pfft.

10:02.848 --> 10:03.925
Of course I want
to do butt stuff.

10:03.949 --> 10:05.017
In fact,

10:05.050 --> 10:06.185
I am so up for

10:06.218 --> 10:07.753
having another crazy night,

10:07.787 --> 10:09.589
I have prepared as well.

10:11.423 --> 10:12.992
Oh, look!

10:13.025 --> 10:14.994
You got a whole mess of cocaine.

10:15.027 --> 10:16.061
Oh, yeah.

10:16.095 --> 10:17.697
'Cause you love cocaine, right?

10:17.730 --> 10:19.732
Yes, I do!

10:19.765 --> 10:22.201
It's my shit.

10:22.234 --> 10:23.168
Cool.

10:23.202 --> 10:25.237
Let's add cocaine
to the butt stuff.

10:30.576 --> 10:31.611
Are you yawning?

10:33.813 --> 10:35.280
I'm just excited

10:35.314 --> 10:37.016
for our night of drugs

10:37.049 --> 10:39.719
and potentially
dangerous sex acts.

10:43.889 --> 10:44.857
Yay.

10:44.890 --> 10:46.225
Yay.

11:22.461 --> 11:24.096
Ooh, we should
let the divorce go through

11:24.129 --> 11:25.430
and then get remarried.

11:25.464 --> 11:27.399
That way, we get to have
another fat-ass party

11:27.432 --> 11:30.670
where everyone has to buy us
more cool prizes off our list.

11:30.703 --> 11:33.072
Still can't believe no one
bought us that doughnut maker.

11:33.105 --> 11:34.640
Those cheapskates.

11:34.674 --> 11:36.642
Can't believe I was disloyal.

11:36.676 --> 11:38.644
To let myself be tempted.

11:38.678 --> 11:40.680
And by the fruit of another.

11:40.713 --> 11:43.082
See, Paul, the great
thing about me

11:43.115 --> 11:46.085
is that I'm incredibly good
at moving past things.

11:46.118 --> 11:47.787
Poof. I forgive you.

11:47.820 --> 11:49.922
No, I meant disloyal to Amy.

11:49.955 --> 11:51.791
What?! Oh, God.

11:51.824 --> 11:53.625
I haven't even met her

11:53.659 --> 11:56.461
and I've already cheated on her.

11:56.495 --> 11:57.429
Cheated on her?

11:57.462 --> 11:58.630
But I'm your wife.

11:58.664 --> 12:01.100
You can't leave!

12:01.133 --> 12:02.201
I love you.

12:02.234 --> 12:05.304
Do you even know
what love means?

12:05.337 --> 12:06.706
Yeah, it's like,
"Hey, I love you.

12:06.739 --> 12:09.441
Smooch, smooch. Now go make me
some Bagel Bites."

12:09.474 --> 12:12.311
Love isn't about having
someone to get you things.

12:12.344 --> 12:15.681
Love is putting someone else's
feelings above your own.

12:15.715 --> 12:17.616
Do you think you
could ever do that?

12:17.649 --> 12:18.951
Honestly?

12:18.984 --> 12:20.485
Ew.

12:20.519 --> 12:22.321
I didn't mean that.

12:26.058 --> 12:29.161
Bi... tch.

12:30.896 --> 12:34.366
Bi... tch.

12:34.399 --> 12:36.168
Wake up, bitch!

12:37.536 --> 12:39.138
Why are you yelling at me?!

12:39.171 --> 12:40.639
What are you doing in my house?

12:40.672 --> 12:42.908
We had a lunch meeting.

12:42.942 --> 12:44.820
Just three dudes sitting alone
in Chin Chin like weirdos.

12:44.844 --> 12:46.078
Oh, shit.

12:46.111 --> 12:49.314
I'm sorry, I haven't
been... sleeping much.

12:49.348 --> 12:50.883
Do I look like a Fitbit?

12:50.916 --> 12:53.252
I don't give a shit
about your sleep.

12:53.285 --> 12:55.087
What I give a shit about

12:55.120 --> 12:56.922
is the unfathomable fact

12:56.956 --> 13:00.692
that you, bitch,
do not respect my brand.

13:00.726 --> 13:01.827
Our brand. Whatever.

13:01.861 --> 13:03.896
I'm here, Sam. What do you need?

13:03.929 --> 13:05.898
I need you to act
like a human person

13:05.931 --> 13:08.667
and pick up your goddamn phone
when I call your stank ass!

13:08.700 --> 13:10.169
I'm sorry.

13:10.202 --> 13:12.547
My cell gets terrible reception
now that I moved to Jimmy's.

13:12.571 --> 13:14.506
You moved in with Jimmy?

13:14.539 --> 13:15.841
I need to talk to you later.

13:15.875 --> 13:17.910
I'm thinking about locking
things down with Jaclyn.

13:17.943 --> 13:21.947
Take this... that's
your God phone.

13:21.981 --> 13:23.959
You pick that shit up when
God wants to talk to you

13:23.983 --> 13:25.717
or you wish to talk to God.

13:25.751 --> 13:27.686
Yo Mobile?

13:27.719 --> 13:29.688
They sell these
at my dispensary.

13:29.721 --> 13:30.890
Guys, I have a work number.

13:30.923 --> 13:32.391
Uh-uh.

13:32.424 --> 13:36.061
Sleepy bitches lose they right
to use normal people phones.

13:36.095 --> 13:39.398
Sleepy bitches only get to use
phones made for hookers

13:39.431 --> 13:42.567
and drug addicts and
irresponsible garbage people!

13:46.005 --> 13:47.306
Come on, let's go.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.055
What should we do tonight?

14:03.088 --> 14:05.657
I don't know.

14:05.690 --> 14:09.428
I mean... we could just,
like, keep it chill.

14:10.495 --> 14:12.764
Like, have a low-key night.

14:12.798 --> 14:15.334
Mellow and easy, but still fun.

14:15.367 --> 14:17.402
Yeah, the yacht rock of nights.

14:17.436 --> 14:20.005
I mean... sure.

14:20.039 --> 14:22.507
I guess that sounds okay to me.

14:25.144 --> 14:26.445
How can I help you kids?

14:26.478 --> 14:27.779
Uh, I moved in with him,

14:27.813 --> 14:31.783
and ever since then,
I've had reception issues,

14:31.817 --> 14:34.186
so I just didn't know
what my options were, but...

14:34.219 --> 14:36.856
Ah, the family plan.

14:36.889 --> 14:39.591
Main Street.

14:39.624 --> 14:42.127
Gingersnaps
at the kitchen table.

14:42.161 --> 14:44.096
An armoire full of board games.

14:44.129 --> 14:46.131
A funny cat video.

14:46.165 --> 14:47.466
A "just checking in" text

14:47.499 --> 14:48.868
exactly when you
need it the most.

14:48.901 --> 14:50.870
The savings?

14:50.903 --> 14:53.438
Well, heck, who doesn't
like to save a buck?

14:53.472 --> 14:56.808
But a family plan
is about people.

14:56.842 --> 14:59.478
People wanting to be part
of something bigger

14:59.511 --> 15:02.714
in this world that feels...

15:02.747 --> 15:05.717
well, too darn big some days,
if you ask me.

15:05.750 --> 15:09.288
Every time you look at your
phone, you'll say to yourself,

15:09.321 --> 15:11.891
"I'm part of something.

15:11.924 --> 15:14.960
"I'm part of a family.

15:14.994 --> 15:17.162
I'm part of a family plan."

15:20.265 --> 15:21.566
How lame was that guy?

15:21.600 --> 15:22.968
Ugh, the lamest.

15:27.272 --> 15:28.573
What's up?

15:28.607 --> 15:31.076
Nothing. Just partying hard
like you guys.

15:31.110 --> 15:33.312
Not exactly like us.

15:33.345 --> 15:36.015
Um, we're on our fifth
shot each.

15:36.048 --> 15:38.317
Wow, alcohol.

15:38.350 --> 15:39.584
Hard core.

15:39.618 --> 15:41.653
Let it go.

15:41.686 --> 15:44.323
For your information,
we did a ton of

15:44.356 --> 15:46.091
cocaine last night.

15:46.125 --> 15:48.760
That's cool... if you're
a day-trader in the '80s

15:48.793 --> 15:51.096
or my dad's new wife Brenda.

15:52.131 --> 15:53.432
Well, what do you assholes have?

15:53.465 --> 15:55.167
It's this new synthetic thing.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.535
Belgian.

15:56.568 --> 15:59.038
They use it to chemically
sterilize horses.

15:59.071 --> 16:00.072
Who cares?

16:00.105 --> 16:01.606
Let's get more shots. How much?

16:01.640 --> 16:02.841
It's pretty intense.

16:02.874 --> 16:04.543
We stole a DVD kiosk last night.

16:04.576 --> 16:05.544
How much?

16:05.577 --> 16:06.745
40 a pill.

16:06.778 --> 16:08.080
$40?!

16:08.113 --> 16:09.581
Give him the cheddar.

16:13.652 --> 16:16.355
Let me just give
you guys a few tips.

16:16.388 --> 16:17.689
Do not listen to music.

16:17.722 --> 16:20.359
Nothing is sucking
you towards it.

16:20.392 --> 16:22.394
Thanks, rookie, we'll be fine.

16:22.427 --> 16:23.695
Okay.

16:23.728 --> 16:25.364
Good luck.

16:25.397 --> 16:26.698
"Do not listen to music"?

16:27.766 --> 16:29.068
Shut up, you little bitch.

16:29.101 --> 16:30.936
I've been doing drugs
since I was nine.

16:30.970 --> 16:32.104
Eat shit, haters.

17:08.373 --> 17:12.243
Lindsay, are you trapped
under something heavy?

17:12.277 --> 17:13.778
All right.

17:13.811 --> 17:15.513
I'm coming in.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.356
At the end of the
day, he wanted me.

17:26.325 --> 17:28.827
He just didn't want me forever.

17:30.795 --> 17:33.365
Lindsay, you know
the people you remember

17:33.398 --> 17:36.035
from, like, history books?

17:36.068 --> 17:37.802
Not a one.

17:37.836 --> 17:39.771
Me neither, actually.

17:39.804 --> 17:43.442
But those explorers
and adventurers in there

17:43.475 --> 17:44.776
were the ones who saw

17:44.809 --> 17:48.113
that snowy, unfriendly,
treacherous mountain pass

17:48.147 --> 17:51.850
and said, "Challenge accepted."

17:53.852 --> 17:56.688
You think I'm an unfriendly
treacherous mountain?

17:57.856 --> 17:59.858
And I think Paul
couldn't hack it.

18:01.326 --> 18:05.497
And for that, he's not only
a fool, but he's a coward.

18:05.530 --> 18:07.566
Thank you.

18:11.370 --> 18:16.041
Meanwhile, I'm gonna die here
alone in the museum of Paul.

18:16.075 --> 18:18.577
And I hate museums.

18:18.610 --> 18:20.679
Then get rid of it all.

18:28.187 --> 18:29.554
Come on.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.169
We can't keep doing this.
This has got to stop.

18:44.203 --> 18:46.538
But I don't want to be
one of the sweater people.

18:46.571 --> 18:48.873
Gretch, we couldn't be
one of the sweater people

18:48.907 --> 18:51.443
even if we wore, like,
ten cardigans each.

18:51.476 --> 18:55.680
But what if only people with
secret sweater people inside

18:55.714 --> 18:57.048
fear becoming sweater people?

18:57.082 --> 18:58.717
Like how homophobes
secretly want

18:58.750 --> 19:00.085
all the dicks in their mouths.

19:00.119 --> 19:02.621
Look, we're not against
sweater people.

19:02.654 --> 19:05.757
We're not protesting sweater
people's right to exist.

19:05.790 --> 19:07.759
We just choose not to be them,

19:07.792 --> 19:10.229
because they remind us
of encroaching death.

19:10.262 --> 19:12.231
Okay?

19:12.264 --> 19:14.199
Okay.

19:14.233 --> 19:17.736
So... you're okay
if I just lie here

19:17.769 --> 19:19.804
and read my book?

19:19.838 --> 19:22.207
As long as it's okay I go
to sleep immediately

19:22.241 --> 19:24.576
and get a refreshing nine hours.

19:25.910 --> 19:27.879
Deal.

19:27.912 --> 19:28.880
Good night.

19:28.913 --> 19:30.215
Good night.

19:30.249 --> 19:31.916
Mm-wah. Mm-wah.

19:33.585 --> 19:36.155
So we'll just stick
to clear liquids?

19:36.188 --> 19:38.257
Sounds good.

19:39.924 --> 19:41.926
Two vodkas.

19:47.532 --> 19:49.568
Do you think Paul wants
his geocaching gear?

19:49.601 --> 19:50.569
Mm.

19:50.602 --> 19:52.571
Maybe he can use it
to track down

19:52.604 --> 19:54.173
his new girlfriend's tiny boobs.

19:55.607 --> 19:56.941
Mean.

19:58.810 --> 20:00.812
Hey, will you take out
this trash...

20:11.790 --> 20:14.693
Thanks for helping me tonight.

20:14.726 --> 20:17.028
Do you want some Bagel Bites?

20:17.061 --> 20:19.130
I could eat.

21:01.673 --> 21:03.508
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:44.716 --> 21:48.420
You know, if you lowered me
about three feet...

Determination,

21:55.994 --> 21:57.562
tenacity,

21:57.596 --> 21:59.364
endurance...

21:59.398 --> 22:00.932
may produce champions,

22:00.965 --> 22:03.768
but legends
really come to life...

22:03.802 --> 22:05.337
when they get hard.

soccer until 3:00. You know what?

22:40.138 --> 22:42.907
I think you need to make
some time to take care of us.

22:42.941 --> 22:44.743
I don't have time.

22:44.776 --> 22:47.688
All I have is 15 minutes between Ella
getting her braces off and Maya's gym.

22:47.712 --> 22:49.748
That's fine. That's why
we have the minivan.
