00:00.158 --> 00:01.137
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.164 --> 00:02.764
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.098 --> 00:04.824
psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:05.162 --> 00:06.184
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.285 --> 00:06.985
Who am I?

00:07.074 --> 00:08.213
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.214 --> 00:08.614
Castle.

00:08.648 --> 00:09.308
Castle.

00:09.309 --> 00:11.309
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.555 --> 00:13.745
Every writer needs  inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:13.855 --> 00:14.674
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:14.709 --> 00:15.729
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:15.764 --> 00:17.670
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:17.716 --> 00:19.202
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:19.203 --> 00:20.203
I get to be on her case.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.180
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:22.215 --> 00:23.091
And together, we catch killers

00:24.039 --> 00:25.027
We make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:25.128 --> 00:26.128
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:26.262 --> 00:26.956
Turner and Hooch.

Meet the late Jack Coonan.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.331
Why is that name familiar?

01:00.332 --> 01:02.032
Because it probably crossed
over all our desks

01:02.632 --> 01:04.733
a dozen times
in the last few years--

01:04.735 --> 01:06.840
Aggravated assault,
A.D.W., arson.

01:06.841 --> 01:08.241
Coonan had a heavy rep.

01:08.341 --> 01:10.176
Word is he's an enforcer
for the Westies.

01:10.177 --> 01:13.016
Okay, remind me--who are
the Westies again?

01:13.017 --> 01:15.054
Irish mafia
out of Hell's Kitchen.

01:15.055 --> 01:17.895
They deal in cargo theft,
counterfeiting, extortion.

01:17.896 --> 01:19.832
And public urination
on St. Patrick's day.

01:19.833 --> 01:22.238
Our boy Coonan also had
a home security system--

01:22.239 --> 01:24.243
12-gauge, hollow point.

01:24.244 --> 01:26.281
That thing could stop
a kodiak in kevlar.

01:26.282 --> 01:28.351
Who did he think
was coming through the door?

Didn't even have time
to pull it out.

01:38.257 --> 01:40.557
This guy was armed

01:41.358 --> 01:42.894

03:12.857 --> 03:14.625
I get all this recognition.

03:14.626 --> 03:16.627

03:22.934 --> 03:24.434
Worse than he deserved.

03:24.435 --> 03:26.803
I make no excuses
for the things my brother did,

we were on our own a lot.

07:01.180 --> 07:03.681
Latin Kings?
It's a violent street gang.

07:03.682 --> 07:05.184
They mostly peddle
girls and drugs.

07:05.185 --> 07:06.585
Yeah, Trucho's
their blade man.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.319
Real handy with the knife.
We never popped him for murder,

07:09.320 --> 07:11.854
but, uh, I met plenty of folks
with fingers missing.

07:11.855 --> 07:13.457
So was there bad blood
between them?

07:13.458 --> 07:14.558
Yeah, they're like the, uh,

07:14.658 --> 07:16.159
Hatfields and McCoys
of Hell's Kitchen.

07:16.160 --> 07:19.694
So the Westies figure that
the Latin Kings killed Coonan,

07:19.695 --> 07:20.729
and they snatch their blade guy
and bring him in

07:20.730 --> 07:22.098
for a little enhanced
interrogation.

07:22.099 --> 07:23.599
Which no one
wants to admit to.

07:23.699 --> 07:25.033
Uh-huh.
Look, my experience--

07:25.134 --> 07:27.868
If Finn went all Gitmo on him,
it was for a reason.

07:27.869 --> 07:30.604
You got a Westie with holes in
him? Trucho's probably your guy.

07:31.005 --> 07:32.839
He's right.
We found Trucho's vehicle

07:32.840 --> 07:35.108
in an alley behind
a little bodega in Rego Park.

07:35.109 --> 07:36.109
It's a big dope spot.

07:36.110 --> 07:37.644
And he left
his little letter opener

07:37.645 --> 07:40.279
tucked behind
the driver's side sun visor.

07:44.582 --> 07:47.350
That's not it.

07:47.351 --> 07:49.519
You didn't even look.
Sure I did.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.520
It's a stiletto,
4-inch Damascus blade,

07:51.521 --> 07:53.922
and it's way too small
to make these wounds.

07:53.923 --> 07:56.525
Well, maybe he used
a different knife.

07:56.526 --> 07:58.293
Just how tall is this Trucho?

07:58.294 --> 07:59.861
He's, uh...

07:59.862 --> 08:01.495
5'6".

08:01.496 --> 08:03.530
Standing on his toes.
Then he's not your guy.

08:03.531 --> 08:05.632
Thrust angle on these wounds

08:05.633 --> 08:08.000
indicate Coonan's killer
was over 6'.

08:08.001 --> 08:10.002
Well, maybe instead of using
a stiletto,

08:10.003 --> 08:11.703
he was wearing stilettos.

08:13.171 --> 08:16.039
Excuse me.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.607
Beckett.

08:17.608 --> 08:19.374
Hey.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.942
Hey.

08:20.943 --> 08:23.011
You okay?

08:23.012 --> 08:24.680
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:27.650 --> 08:30.050
Tech's got some hits
off of Coonan's phone.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.352
Maybe they can shed some light.

08:31.353 --> 08:32.953
- Thank you, Lanie.
- Mm-hmm.

08:38.022 --> 08:38.924
The last call

08:38.924 --> 08:41.363
that Coonan made
was to a New York landline.

08:41.364 --> 08:43.400
Because of the damage
to the sim,

08:43.400 --> 08:45.004
It's missing the last two digits
of the phone number.

08:45.005 --> 08:46.105
Well,
that's 99 possibilities.

08:46.205 --> 08:48.540
We better get dialing.
Ryan, I'm looking at you.

08:48.541 --> 08:50.944
Well, no, the numbers are
all from the same phone tree.

08:50.945 --> 08:52.445
Here's where
it gets interesting.

08:52.745 --> 08:54.912

09:31.550 --> 09:33.517
worry about hair products
and press conferences

09:33.518 --> 09:35.719
when they should be out
catching bad men.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.422
I take it you're not
from around these parts.

09:38.423 --> 09:39.423
No, sir.

09:39.523 --> 09:41.125
I'm not.
But for my many sins,

09:41.126 --> 09:44.160
the Bureau has transferred me
here to New York.

09:44.161 --> 09:46.462
How did you come into contact
with Jack Coonan?

09:46.463 --> 09:48.598
He reached out to us
about a week ago.

09:48.599 --> 09:50.199
And you signed him on
as an informant.

09:50.299 --> 09:50.966
Nope.

09:52.167 --> 09:53.267
Why not?

09:53.667 --> 09:54.634
'cause all there were
were overtures.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.637
And I wasn't about to trade
the family cow

09:56.638 --> 09:57.772
for a bunch of magic beans.

09:58.573 --> 09:59.573
You didn't trust him?

09:59.673 --> 10:01.973
When a case like Coonan
reaches out to the Bureau,

10:01.974 --> 10:03.577
it's usually 'cause he crossed
his bosses.

10:03.578 --> 10:05.878
And he's hard up to
trade them in to the Bureau

10:05.978 --> 10:07.545
for a quick trip into
the waiting arms of Witsec.

10:07.546 --> 10:09.380
Who was Coonan
offering up?

10:09.381 --> 10:10.682
Never found out.

10:10.983 --> 10:12.683
Well, whoever it was
must have gotten wind of it.

10:12.783 --> 10:14.683
And then killed Coonan
before he had a chance

10:14.684 --> 10:17.019
to deliver them
to the FBI.

10:17.020 --> 10:19.487
The Westies are a bit like
the rogue state of Iran

10:19.488 --> 10:21.622
and the great state of Texas.

10:21.623 --> 10:24.390
They're not too shy in handing
out the death penalty.

10:24.391 --> 10:28.493
And talking to the FBI is
definitely a capital offense.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.528
We need to talk
to Finn Rourke again.

10:31.529 --> 10:34.964
An angel
visited Jacky's home

10:35.065 --> 10:36.133
two nights ago.

10:37.534 --> 10:40.369
Same angel as took
the pharaoh's firstborn.

10:42.070 --> 10:43.171
Now I know some of you think

10:43.372 --> 10:45.373
you don't know
the angel of death.

10:45.374 --> 10:48.976
But trust me, lads.
He knows you.

10:48.977 --> 10:51.211
So...

10:51.212 --> 10:53.179
Here's to darlin' Jacky.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.514
to Jay.
Huh? If he's up in heaven now,

10:55.515 --> 10:59.317
You can be sure he broke in
when they was at Vespers.

11:11.199 --> 11:13.100
Come to honor the dead
I hope.

11:14.101 --> 11:17.735
If not, I'll thank you
to move away out of this place.

11:17.836 --> 11:18.606
You're lying.

11:18.607 --> 11:21.743
You know exactly what happened
to Jack Coonan.

11:21.744 --> 11:24.912
That once-over
that you gave Trucho

11:24.913 --> 11:26.748
was just a piece of theater
to throw them all off,

11:26.749 --> 11:28.483
just like your eulogy.

11:29.484 --> 11:31.452
Now you be careful,
Detective.

11:31.453 --> 11:34.455
Or else what? You'll kill me
just like you killed Coonan

11:34.456 --> 11:36.255
after he went to the feds
about you?

11:36.256 --> 11:37.589
Enough.

11:37.590 --> 11:40.992
I'll not have you
slander him like this.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.093
Not tonight.

11:42.094 --> 11:44.194
I got it
straight from the FBI.

11:44.195 --> 11:47.363
Jack reached out to them
just before he died.

11:50.632 --> 11:53.098
He turned on you,
didn't he?

11:53.099 --> 11:55.099
You don't know what you're
talking about, boy-o.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.600
Jacky Coonan was loyal
to his last breath.

11:57.601 --> 12:00.235
He died in a state of grace.

12:01.136 --> 12:02.503
Even if what you say is true,

12:02.504 --> 12:05.239
you can be sure Jacky wasn't
talking to the g's

12:05.240 --> 12:06.273
about any of us.

12:06.274 --> 12:07.876
How can you be so sure?

12:13.046 --> 12:14.513
You've heard of me.

12:14.714 --> 12:17.683
You've heard I'm a gangster
and a thief.

12:18.484 --> 12:19.918
Surely...

12:19.919 --> 12:23.221
You've heard
I've killed men.

12:23.222 --> 12:25.689
But you answer me this,
Detective.

12:25.690 --> 12:29.026
Have you ever heard
of Finn Rourke running drugs?

12:29.027 --> 12:31.461
Someone was bringing it
in here,

12:31.462 --> 12:34.197
into my neighborhood,
my backyard.

12:34.198 --> 12:35.798
I sent Jacky

12:35.799 --> 12:37.866
to find the bastards
behind it--

12:37.867 --> 12:41.236
find them and punish them...

12:41.237 --> 12:43.371
According to our rules.

12:43.372 --> 12:46.107
Only they punished him
instead.

12:46.108 --> 12:48.676
Aye.

12:50.077 --> 12:51.945
That they did.

12:54.046 --> 12:55.247
Now...

12:55.248 --> 12:56.848
If you have probable cause

12:56.849 --> 12:59.117
I suggest you arrest me now.

13:00.118 --> 13:03.020
If not, I'll remind you,
this is a private party.

13:03.421 --> 13:04.355
and I'll thank you

13:04.356 --> 13:07.091
to get the hell
out of my place!

13:07.092 --> 13:10.461
<i>♪</i>

13:16.668 --> 13:18.402
Another.

13:18.403 --> 13:22.105
<i>♪</i>

13:27.443 --> 13:29.645
Give her a minute, Castle.
She can't just follow us out.

13:29.646 --> 13:31.780
it would be too obvious.
You noticed her?

13:31.781 --> 13:34.248
I'm a Homicide Detective.

13:34.249 --> 13:35.249
If there's one thing
I know how to spot,

13:35.550 --> 13:37.317
it's a lady looking
to unburden herself.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.788
She's looking for us.

13:42.789 --> 13:45.025
No, no, no. Don't honk,
deep throat. You'll spook her.

13:53.565 --> 13:55.598
Hi, I'm Molly.

13:55.599 --> 13:59.001
Hi, Molly. I'm Kate. Can we
maybe give you a lift somewhere?

13:59.002 --> 14:00.769
Anywhere but here.

14:02.505 --> 14:06.374
Of course I knew
Jack's reputation.

14:06.375 --> 14:09.710
It's part of what
attracted me to him.

14:09.711 --> 14:11.344
What?

14:11.345 --> 14:14.947
You telling me you never had
a thing for bad boys, Kate?

14:14.948 --> 14:16.649
No comment.

14:16.650 --> 14:18.917
So Jack never mentioned
going to the FBI?

14:18.918 --> 14:21.186
Jack never discussed business.

14:21.187 --> 14:23.621
But I knew he wanted out.

14:24.622 --> 14:27.824
We talked about...
going somewhere far away.

14:27.825 --> 14:32.027
Last week, Jack warned me
he might get there first.

14:32.028 --> 14:33.263
Jack saw this coming?

14:33.264 --> 14:34.864
We spent
every night together.

14:35.364 --> 14:37.399
He couldn't get to sleep
without me next to him.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.869
But last week, he wouldn't
even let me come over.

14:41.670 --> 14:43.470
Anybody but Jack,

14:43.471 --> 14:46.206
and I'd have thought he had
something going on the side.

14:46.207 --> 14:48.808
That never crossed
your mind?

14:57.316 --> 14:59.150
This is the last thing

14:59.151 --> 15:01.752
Jack ever gave me,

15:01.753 --> 15:04.688
on the last night
I ever spent with him.

15:04.689 --> 15:06.722
Jack said
if things broke bad,

15:06.723 --> 15:09.691
he wanted me to give this
to the police.

15:09.692 --> 15:12.793
And how do you know
it's to a bus locker?

15:12.794 --> 15:15.129
It's always
to a bus locker.

15:15.130 --> 15:17.131
T.S.A.
tore most of them out,

15:17.132 --> 15:19.099
but a few terminals
still have them,

15:19.100 --> 15:21.034
and this one is the closest
to Coonan's apartment.

15:21.035 --> 15:22.569
Wait. No, no, no.
Wait. Don't do that.

15:22.570 --> 15:23.270
What?

15:23.370 --> 15:24.770
Well, once you on it,
then we'll know.

15:24.971 --> 15:28.306
Could be an alien corpse
in there, arc of the covenant...

15:29.007 --> 15:31.174
or Johnny Vong DVDs.

15:31.275 --> 15:32.176
You gotta be kidding me.

15:33.277 --> 15:34.447
This is what Coonan wanted
to give to the feds?

15:34.548 --> 15:35.548
Hold on.

15:38.448 --> 15:39.782
No.

15:41.417 --> 15:44.453
No, this.

15:52.462 --> 15:53.164
Heroin.

15:53.165 --> 15:55.365
That was so cool
just now.

15:55.465 --> 15:57.034
You like that?
Yeah, it was very "Miami Vice."

15:57.035 --> 15:58.502
Mm-hmm.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.674
Coonan wasn't going

16:02.675 --> 16:03.477
to the feds
rat out his Westie pals.

16:03.478 --> 16:04.779
He was looking to rat out

16:04.780 --> 16:06.513
the drug dealer
Finn Rourke sent him to find.

16:06.814 --> 16:08.514
Only the dealer
flips the script.

16:09.014 --> 16:10.781
Knifes Coonan before he can
close the deal with the feds.

16:10.782 --> 16:12.918
So then we find the dealer,
and we find the killer.

16:13.019 --> 16:15.820
These boxes say the DVDs
were packaged in Hong Kong.

16:16.021 --> 16:17.755
Someone must be
slipping their heroin in

16:17.756 --> 16:18.324
before they're shipped.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.725
Which means someone on this end
had to know

16:19.825 --> 16:21.093
which boxes contain the drugs.

16:21.094 --> 16:22.794
And which boxes contain
the secret path

16:22.894 --> 16:24.163
to financial independence.

16:26.464 --> 16:27.165
What?

16:27.166 --> 16:30.201
It had to be someone in
Johnny Vong's organization.

16:31.670 --> 16:33.403
Yeah!

16:33.404 --> 16:35.539
I don't care
if you're a busboy.

16:35.540 --> 16:38.041
I don't care if you wear
the green apron

16:38.042 --> 16:40.743
and serve fancy coffee to a jerk
talking on his bluetooth.

16:40.744 --> 16:43.445
I was like you once.
we love you!

16:43.446 --> 16:46.981
Then I discovered the one secret
that changed my whole life.

16:46.982 --> 16:49.283
Who out there is ready?

16:49.284 --> 16:52.019
This place reminds me
of my second wedding.

16:52.020 --> 16:54.254
ah. Yeah!

16:55.756 --> 16:59.257
Who is ready to close escrow
on a new life?

16:59.258 --> 17:01.691
Come on! Ha ha!

17:01.692 --> 17:03.694
Don't even think about
taking them off.

17:03.695 --> 17:05.694
If you do,
I will pepper spray you.

17:05.695 --> 17:08.063
Whoo!

17:08.064 --> 17:10.231
Ha ha, you, baby!
Mr. Vong.

17:10.232 --> 17:11.699
Yeah, you!

17:12.000 --> 17:14.666
Mr. Vong, I'm Detective Kate Beckett
with the NYPD.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.137
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

17:16.739 --> 17:17.440
Sure, sure, sure.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.340
We believe that
one of your employees

17:19.441 --> 17:21.108
was smuggling heroin
into the country

17:21.210 --> 17:22.676
using your supply chain.

17:22.678 --> 17:23.678
Smuggle what?

17:23.778 --> 17:24.712
Smack.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.780
Would you mind if we looked
into your--

17:28.449 --> 17:30.150
Oh!

17:30.151 --> 17:32.385
Ah!
Ooh. Ugh.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.453
Heroin trafficking--

17:35.454 --> 17:38.021
That's good
for a 10-year prison bid.

17:38.022 --> 17:40.023
So I don't blame you
for running.

17:40.024 --> 17:41.791
This is all
a big mistake.

17:41.792 --> 17:43.292
I never do drugs.

17:43.293 --> 17:45.794
Drugs are for losers.
I'm a businessman.

17:45.795 --> 17:48.330
I try to help people
achieve their goals.

17:48.331 --> 17:50.830
So long as their goals
are to blow 300 bucks

17:50.831 --> 17:53.031
on your bogus real estate system.
No, listen,

17:53.032 --> 17:55.200
I offer you 30-day,
money-back guarantee.

17:55.201 --> 17:57.735
If you don't start building
wealth by then,

17:57.736 --> 18:00.337
I refund all your money,
no questions asked.

18:00.338 --> 18:01.674
<i>Could I make that offer
if this was some kind of scam?</i>

18:01.675 --> 18:02.675
The man has a point.

18:03.075 --> 18:05.075
Shut up.
You don't think he--

18:05.076 --> 18:06.676
No.
Yeah.

18:06.677 --> 18:09.445
Look, here's the deal--
I'm not a dope cop.

18:09.446 --> 18:10.947
I'm a Homicide Detective.

18:10.948 --> 18:13.949
So usually I don't even bother
with your sort of an operation.

18:13.950 --> 18:15.984
But my problem, and yours,

18:15.985 --> 18:17.952
is the fact that you had
Jack Coonan killed

18:17.953 --> 18:20.054
in order to hide
your heroin smuggling.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.289
Wait. Jack Coonan's dead?

18:22.290 --> 18:24.991
Whoa.
Careful there, Johnny.

18:24.992 --> 18:27.458
Your accent's starting
to fade a little.

18:27.459 --> 18:30.093
Look, I didn't come over
on a boat, okay?

18:30.094 --> 18:32.995
I've never even been to Laos.
I'm from Danville, California.

18:32.996 --> 18:35.063
And this whole
Johnny Vong thing?

18:35.064 --> 18:37.031
No one wants to buy
a real estate system

18:37.032 --> 18:39.165
from a Harvard M.B.A.,
but show them an idiot

18:39.166 --> 18:40.700
with a Rolls-Royce,
and they'll knock down doors.

18:40.701 --> 18:42.069
So I played Johnny Vong.

18:42.270 --> 18:44.571
You know, people want
all that Horatio Alger crap,

18:44.572 --> 18:45.138
So that's what I give 'em.

18:45.439 --> 18:46.739
Well, that and heroin.

18:46.839 --> 18:48.273
How exactly
did you know Jack Coonan?

18:48.874 --> 18:51.441
Look, whatever you think
you know,

18:51.542 --> 18:53.843
I promise you,
I didn't kill Coonan.

18:54.144 --> 18:55.577
You have to believe me.

18:55.578 --> 18:58.346
Do I?
Nothing about you is real.

18:58.347 --> 19:01.219
No.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.620
I needed money to take
the program national.

19:05.621 --> 19:07.991
He needed a way to get
product into the country.

19:08.992 --> 19:11.261
It was stupid, but once you make
a deal with the devil,

19:12.562 --> 19:13.629
You belong to him.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.097
Who do you belong to?
Who are you working for?

19:16.198 --> 19:17.099
He'll kill me.

19:17.100 --> 19:20.801
I can protect you.
You can't. Nobody can.

19:21.002 --> 19:22.036
You don't know
what he's capable of.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.705
You don't believe me.
Ask Jack Coonan.

19:23.706 --> 19:24.506
Look, Mr. Vong, I--

19:24.606 --> 19:27.707
No. I'll take my chances
in prison.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.510
I'd rather lose ten years
of my life than all of it.

19:33.511 --> 19:34.678
Whoever he's working for

19:34.679 --> 19:36.580
scares him a lot more
than prison.

19:36.581 --> 19:38.516
There has to be a way
to get it out of him.

19:39.217 --> 19:40.720
We could force him to watch
Paris Hilton videos.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.321
You want me
brought up on charges?

19:42.322 --> 19:43.322
Beckett?

19:43.323 --> 19:44.923
Hey Lanie,
what are you doing here?

19:45.321 --> 19:47.422
Uh, it's about
the Coonan case.

19:47.423 --> 19:49.457
This is Dr. Clark Murray.

19:49.526 --> 19:53.528
He's a forensic pathologist.
I asked him to consult.

19:53.529 --> 19:55.197
I'm, uh,
Detective Kate Beckett.

19:55.198 --> 19:57.966
This is Richard Castle, the novelist.
We've met.

20:02.303 --> 20:03.803
Note the rectangular bruising

20:03.904 --> 20:05.071
around these wounds...
Mm-hmm.

20:05.072 --> 20:07.039
Here and here...
Mm-hmm.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.442
Caused by the hilt of the knife
striking with force enough

20:09.443 --> 20:10.909
to compress the skin.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.078
And as a result,
the injuries

20:13.079 --> 20:15.247
penetrate deeper than
the actual length of the blade.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.249
He's also honed his blade
so fine,

20:17.250 --> 20:20.817
It's brittle enough for bits
to break when it strikes bone,

20:21.518 --> 20:22.252
Which is why slivers of blade

20:22.253 --> 20:24.321
were found inside
both of his victims.

20:25.122 --> 20:28.924
We now know those slivers come
from the same murder weapon.

20:29.625 --> 20:31.959
Wait, two victims? How many
people has he killed?

20:31.960 --> 20:34.127
Five that we know of.

20:34.128 --> 20:35.629
So we're looking
at a serial?

20:35.630 --> 20:36.930
Well, yes and no.

20:37.030 --> 20:39.030
We believe we're dealing
with a professional,

20:39.031 --> 20:41.065
someone with extensive
military training.

20:41.066 --> 20:41.935
A contract killer?

20:43.036 --> 20:45.736
I used tomographic reconstruction
of Coonan's wounds

20:45.737 --> 20:48.940
to generate a 3-D model
of the blade used.

20:48.941 --> 20:51.508
It's a special operations group knife...

20:51.509 --> 20:55.411
The kind favored by
special forces in Gulf War one.

20:55.412 --> 20:58.314
He kills with a single blow

20:58.315 --> 21:00.583
using these other wounds
to camouflage the skill

21:00.584 --> 21:03.586
with which the initial stroke
was delivered.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.689
The very same method
and the very same weapon

21:07.690 --> 21:11.226
That the killer employed...
ten years ago.

21:15.795 --> 21:18.031
L-Lanie...

21:18.032 --> 21:20.133
I'm so sorry.

21:20.134 --> 21:22.135
Detective Beckett,

21:22.136 --> 21:25.871
there is no doubt in my mind

21:25.872 --> 21:27.873
that Jack Coonan was killed

21:27.874 --> 21:31.075
by the same man
who murdered your mother.

21:38.749 --> 21:41.184
I am the investigator
of record on this case.

21:41.185 --> 21:43.820
You had no right
to withhold evidence from me.

21:43.821 --> 21:45.421
Well, what did you expect?

21:45.521 --> 21:47.586
The last time Castle tried
to talk to you

21:47.587 --> 21:49.888
about your mother's murder,
you bit his head off.

21:49.889 --> 21:51.522
Please, Lanie.

21:51.523 --> 21:54.224
I noticed
the wound similarity.

21:54.225 --> 21:56.960
I reached out to Dr. Murray.

21:56.961 --> 21:58.829
I held off from telling you

21:58.830 --> 22:01.164
until I knew the evidence
was rock-solid.

22:01.165 --> 22:03.499
Beckett, we came to you
the moment we were sure.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.101
Beckett. Can I have
a word with you?

22:15.876 --> 22:17.644
Poor man's painkiller.

22:23.515 --> 22:25.717
I know your mother's murder wa
the reason you became a cop.

22:26.718 --> 22:28.385
And I know how you
almost lost yourself

22:28.386 --> 22:30.388
trying to solve her case
the first time you tried.

22:30.689 --> 22:32.956
I figured sooner or later,
when you were ready,

22:33.457 --> 22:35.458
you'd want to take
another run at it.

22:35.459 --> 22:37.727
I just never expected
her killer to come around

22:37.728 --> 22:40.262
and sucker punch you
like this.

22:40.463 --> 22:42.630
Kate, listen to me.

22:42.631 --> 22:46.199
You're the finest homicide
I've ever trained, bar none.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.169
And I want you to stay on this one,
if you can.

22:49.170 --> 22:51.204
If you're up to it.

22:51.205 --> 22:52.540
But I wouldn't be doing
my job as your Captain

22:52.541 --> 22:53.576
if I didn't ask...

22:55.477 --> 22:56.577
Can you handle this?

23:01.513 --> 23:03.547
I'm sorry, sir.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.349
I can't.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.422
Beckett.

23:13.124 --> 23:14.591
Kate.

23:31.738 --> 23:34.207
Katie.

23:34.208 --> 23:36.042
Hey, dad.

23:36.043 --> 23:37.545
Hi.

23:37.546 --> 23:40.014
Mm.

23:49.020 --> 23:51.621
So... what have you found?

23:55.057 --> 23:57.328
I don't know yet.

23:57.329 --> 23:59.030
But enough to scare you.

23:59.031 --> 24:01.499
Yeah.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.801
I didn't sleep well
that whole first year

24:03.802 --> 24:05.770
after you got out
of the Academy.

24:05.771 --> 24:07.971
I'd hear sirens in the night

24:07.972 --> 24:10.707
and imagine you off
in the darkness someplace.

24:10.708 --> 24:14.276
I had nightmares
where it swallowed you whole.

24:18.914 --> 24:22.082
Dad, I don't want
to lose this one.

24:22.083 --> 24:25.585
Your mother always said
that life...

24:25.586 --> 24:28.120
bever delivers anything
that we can't handle.

24:28.121 --> 24:31.323
I mean, she lived by that,
you know?

24:31.324 --> 24:34.759
Called it Johanna's
immutable law of the universe.

24:34.760 --> 24:38.127
And for years,
I thought she was wrong...

24:38.128 --> 24:40.863
because I couldn't handle
losing her.

24:40.864 --> 24:42.964
Now...

24:42.965 --> 24:45.232
I can almost
hear her whisper,

24:45.233 --> 24:47.635
"I told you so."

24:47.636 --> 24:49.103
Four of mom's
favorite words.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.605
Look...

24:51.606 --> 24:54.007
She was a devout believer
in the truth,

24:54.008 --> 24:56.009
and if she were here
right now,

24:56.010 --> 24:57.878
she'd tell you,
the truth can never hurt you.

24:57.879 --> 25:00.346
You know, this may be
your mother's way

25:00.347 --> 25:02.881
of reaching out to you,
Katie...

25:02.882 --> 25:06.017
and reminding you
that the truth...

25:06.018 --> 25:08.385
is still your weapon
to wield,

25:08.386 --> 25:11.021
not theirs.

25:17.894 --> 25:19.294
Hey.

25:19.295 --> 25:20.262
Hey.

25:20.263 --> 25:22.431
Come in.

25:22.432 --> 25:24.466
Thank you.

25:24.467 --> 25:26.235
Mm.

25:26.236 --> 25:28.370
Hang in there, kiddo.

25:28.371 --> 25:30.873
Thank you, Martha.

25:30.874 --> 25:35.710
Leftovers in the fridge.
Upstairs if you need us.

25:35.711 --> 25:38.379
Please.

25:39.380 --> 25:41.614
I will do anything
that you need,

25:41.615 --> 25:43.049
including nothing,

25:43.050 --> 25:45.550
if that's what you want.

25:46.551 --> 25:48.219
What I want is to find
my mother's killer.

25:50.220 --> 25:52.221
Well, then we need to break
Johnny Vong.

25:53.222 --> 25:54.656
So let's break him.

25:57.125 --> 25:58.460
I owe you an apology,
Mr. Vong.

25:59.461 --> 26:00.962
Apparently in my haste,

26:00.963 --> 26:03.030
I forgot to read you
your Miranda rights.

26:03.031 --> 26:04.931
You're free to go.

26:04.932 --> 26:07.000
No! I remember distinctly.
You read them to me.

26:07.001 --> 26:09.836
And I waived them all. You did.
She did. You remember, right?

26:09.837 --> 26:12.205
Sorry, man.
It's a rookie mistake.

26:12.206 --> 26:15.207
What? No, wait.
You can't--you can't do this.

26:15.208 --> 26:16.441
If I walk out of here now,

26:16.442 --> 26:17.577
he'll think
I'm cooperating with the cops.

26:17.778 --> 26:19.211
I'll be dead by morning.

26:21.612 --> 26:23.279
Yes, you will.

26:23.280 --> 26:26.215
Or you can tell me
who you're working for,

26:26.216 --> 26:28.250
and I will protect you.

26:33.689 --> 26:35.256
Dick Coonan.

26:35.257 --> 26:37.124
I work for Dick.

26:37.125 --> 26:39.259
You're telling me

26:39.260 --> 26:41.928
Jack Coonan's brother
is a drug trafficker?

26:41.929 --> 26:44.899
He comes off like Jimmy Carter,
but it was all a scam

26:44.900 --> 26:46.900
to funnel money to the Warlords
with the poppy fields.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.967
Sure, he built a few schools,

26:48.968 --> 26:50.969
uh, so he had pictures
for his donors,

26:50.970 --> 26:53.537
but, you know, most of
the money funded his cartel.

26:53.538 --> 26:55.539
So he had access
to all the dope he wanted.

26:55.540 --> 26:58.174
He just needed a way
of getting it into the country.

26:58.175 --> 27:00.176
You couldn't get an aspirin
from Kabul to New York

27:00.177 --> 27:02.178
without somebody knowing
about it, not since 9/11.

27:02.179 --> 27:03.679
All I had to do

27:03.680 --> 27:06.214
was let him package the drugs
at my factory in Hong Kong.

27:06.215 --> 27:08.683
He'd pick up the dirty shipments
once they cleared customs.

27:08.684 --> 27:10.653
And he had the Latin Kings
put it on the street.

27:10.654 --> 27:11.654
Perfect system.

27:11.854 --> 27:14.188
Well, perfect until Trucho
caught a case of stupid

27:14.189 --> 27:16.523
and started selling
in the Westies' territory.

27:16.524 --> 27:18.858
And then that's what brought
Jack sniffing around.

27:18.859 --> 27:21.694
Jack threatened to give him
to the feds unless he quit.

27:21.695 --> 27:24.362
So Dick killed
his own brother.
Oh, no.

27:24.363 --> 27:26.731
Jack had been with
the Westies a long time.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.899
He'd grown eyes
in the back of his head.

27:28.900 --> 27:31.502
Dick hired a professional.

27:31.503 --> 27:33.336
What's his name?

27:33.337 --> 27:36.205
Uh, he called him Rathborne.

27:36.206 --> 27:38.073
How do I find him?

27:39.743 --> 27:41.743
Ask Dick Coonan.

27:45.493 --> 27:47.961
So...
Any, uh, progress

27:47.962 --> 27:50.198
on the son of a bitch
who killed my brother?

27:50.199 --> 27:51.199
We're close.

27:51.299 --> 27:53.865
We think that Jack was killed
after Rourke asked him

27:53.866 --> 27:55.067
to hunt down a drug dealer.

27:55.068 --> 27:56.568
Turns out the Westies
have done a pretty good job

27:56.668 --> 27:58.269
with the war on drugs
these past few years.

27:58.570 --> 28:00.504
Talk about zero tolerance.
The punishment

28:00.605 --> 28:02.440
for dealing drugs in
their neighborhood is death.

28:02.441 --> 28:05.008
But when he tracked down
this dealer,

28:05.109 --> 28:06.409
for some reason,

28:06.410 --> 28:08.445
Jack didn't have the heart
to kill him.

28:09.846 --> 28:11.980
That is so Jacky.

28:11.981 --> 28:14.415
He always led with his chin.
He went through life

28:14.416 --> 28:16.284
like he was expecting to win
the good sportsman award

28:16.285 --> 28:17.120
on trophy night.

28:17.121 --> 28:18.421
Cut the crap, Coonan.

28:20.221 --> 28:22.955
We know all about
your heroin triangle--

28:23.756 --> 28:26.457
Afghanistan, Hong Kong...

28:26.458 --> 28:28.326
New York.

28:28.427 --> 28:31.295
And we also know that you hired
an assassin named Rathborne

28:31.296 --> 28:34.098
to kill your brother before he
went to the feds about you.

28:43.236 --> 28:45.971
Prove it.

29:00.486 --> 29:01.888
Are you okay?

29:06.192 --> 29:08.694
Ten years since we came home

29:08.795 --> 29:11.363
and found that Detective
waiting for us.

29:13.164 --> 29:16.198
Ten years since we crossed
that yellow tape

29:16.199 --> 29:17.299
and went into that alley.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.568
And every time I cross the tape
at a crime scene,

29:19.569 --> 29:20.337
I think of that night.

29:21.738 --> 29:24.541
That's what makes you
such a good cop.

29:28.579 --> 29:31.047
What if I let her down?

29:37.653 --> 29:39.320
Do you know why I chose you

29:39.321 --> 29:41.289
as my inspiration
for Nikki Heat?

29:41.590 --> 29:44.658
No. Why?

29:44.659 --> 29:46.627
Because you're tall.

29:50.630 --> 29:52.832
Now go in there
and do your job.

29:53.933 --> 29:55.701
I have forensic accountants

29:55.802 --> 29:58.503
digging through
your organization, Mr. Coonan.

29:58.504 --> 30:00.604
If there's evidence
of heroin trafficking,

30:00.605 --> 30:01.473
they will find it.

30:01.574 --> 30:05.009
But that's not
your biggest problem right now.

30:06.010 --> 30:07.877
Hiring an assassin
like Rathborne

30:07.878 --> 30:11.514
shows premeditation, and that makes
this a special circumstance case.

30:11.815 --> 30:14.250
Which qualifies you
for the needle.

30:16.019 --> 30:18.020
Now I am willing to take

30:18.021 --> 30:21.957
the special circumstance
allegations off the table

30:21.958 --> 30:24.559
if you give me Rathborne.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.995
The only special circumstance
here, Detective,

30:26.996 --> 30:31.465
is your complete lack
of evidence against me.

30:31.466 --> 30:33.333
I ve Johnny Vong.

30:35.837 --> 30:39.606
The guy with the phony accent
and the real estate scam?

30:41.176 --> 30:43.477
Is that the best
you can do?

30:43.478 --> 30:46.246
Are you really willing
to bet your life

30:46.247 --> 30:49.549
that Vong can't hold his mud,
Mr. Coonan?

30:49.550 --> 30:52.451
Give me the killer, and I will
put the D.A. in the mood

30:52.452 --> 30:55.887
for a second-degree plea.

30:55.888 --> 30:57.855
When we first met,

30:57.856 --> 31:01.625
you told me you'd been
on the other side of this.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.627
Remember?

31:03.628 --> 31:08.097
Now... could that be why
you seem so eager

31:08.098 --> 31:11.967
to get your hands
on this myterious assassin?

31:11.968 --> 31:13.969
Because if I had to guess,

31:13.970 --> 31:16.471
I'd say that someone
close to you was murdered,

31:16.472 --> 31:19.773
and you think Rathborne
had something to do with it.

31:19.774 --> 31:23.476
But I don't have to guess,
do I?

31:23.477 --> 31:26.946
Because it's all over
your face.

31:26.947 --> 31:28.947
That still
doesn't change the fact

31:28.948 --> 31:31.249
that you're guilty of murder.

31:31.250 --> 31:32.984
Maybe not.

31:32.985 --> 31:38.254
But for the low, low price
of transactional immunity,

31:38.255 --> 31:42.090
I can give you the closure
you've been seeking.

31:42.091 --> 31:45.059
You get Rathborne,
and I walk.

31:45.060 --> 31:49.362
And that, Detective,
is my final offer.

31:51.063 --> 31:52.266
Transactional immunity, Paul,

31:52.267 --> 31:54.469
and I'm inclined
to give it to him.

31:54.470 --> 31:57.605
Rathborne has killed five
that we know of,

31:57.606 --> 32:00.675
including the mother
of one of my people.

32:00.676 --> 32:02.643
It's one of our own, Paul.

32:02.644 --> 32:05.646
I remember that used to
mean something in this town.

32:11.820 --> 32:13.186
Well?

32:13.187 --> 32:15.722
He went for it.
The district attorney

32:15.723 --> 32:17.890
is gonna offer Coonan immunity
if he gives us Rathborne.

32:17.891 --> 32:21.226
I hope you know
what the hell you're doing.

32:21.227 --> 32:22.961
Describe him.

32:22.962 --> 32:24.963
About my height.

32:24.964 --> 32:27.132
Just so average,
he's almost invisible.

32:27.533 --> 32:28.535
How did you meet?

32:29.336 --> 32:30.636
We were
in the service together.

32:30.936 --> 32:32.436
They said he'd been killed

32:32.437 --> 32:34.537
back in a training exercise
in '95.

32:34.538 --> 32:37.473
But then about a year ago,
I'm sitting at a bar

32:37.474 --> 32:40.743
and I glance across,
and I'm looking at a ghost.

32:40.744 --> 32:43.612
Turns out he'd actually been
recruited back then, not killed,

32:43.613 --> 32:45.280
to do...

32:45.281 --> 32:48.383
Well, the bad stuff
that governments like to deny.

32:48.384 --> 32:49.385
How'd you hire him?

32:49.386 --> 32:50.186
He'd given me the number

32:50.187 --> 32:51.688
to his answering service
in the Caymans.

32:51.789 --> 32:54.557
And then they provided me with
a single-use e-mail address,

32:54.558 --> 32:56.026
a numbered account.

32:56.227 --> 32:57.561
E-mailed him the name
of his target,

32:57.562 --> 32:59.429
wired him the money
and waited.

32:59.930 --> 33:01.531
Okay, here's the deal--

33:02.632 --> 33:06.334
You're gonna contact Rathborne
with a contract on Vong.

33:06.435 --> 33:08.037
You're gonna tell him that
the police are taking him

33:08.038 --> 33:09.539
to the D.A.'s office
for a deposition,

33:09.540 --> 33:10.842
that he can't
make it there alive.

33:10.843 --> 33:12.543
It doesn't work like that.

33:13.343 --> 33:17.145
He wants his money up front.
It's 100 grand, nonnegotiable.

33:17.246 --> 33:20.181
100 grand? The city is never
gonna agree to that.

33:20.182 --> 33:22.516
Look, you want to catch her
killer, the price is 100 grand.

33:22.517 --> 33:24.886
I can't just shoot that kind
of money out into space

33:24.887 --> 33:26.356
without any hope
of getting it back.

33:26.357 --> 33:28.857
You can't. I can.
This one's on me.

33:28.957 --> 33:30.524
Castle--
Do we have a deal?

33:30.525 --> 33:31.561
We do...

33:32.562 --> 33:33.762
but my client's
immunity kicks in

33:33.862 --> 33:35.362
the moment Rathborne
accepts the contract,

33:36.163 --> 33:37.932
once the wire transfer
is complete.

33:43.738 --> 33:45.906
As soon as Rathborne
takes the job,

33:45.907 --> 33:48.041
your part is done.

33:48.042 --> 33:50.644
And I walk?
And you walk.

33:53.547 --> 33:56.149
Rathborne has taken the bait.

33:56.150 --> 33:58.485
Now for today's performance,
the role of Johnny Vong

33:58.486 --> 34:00.588
will be played
by officer Clayton Lee.

34:00.589 --> 34:02.458
We who are about to die
salute you.

34:02.459 --> 34:05.459
Ryan and Esposito will escort
Lee to the D.A.'s office

34:05.559 --> 34:07.293
via a prearranged route.

34:07.394 --> 34:11.161
We'll have plainclothes in place
on every corner and mid-block,

34:11.163 --> 34:12.831
and there'll also
be air support,

34:12.833 --> 34:15.500
for what it's worth.
Not a whole lot.

34:15.501 --> 34:16.702
No one even know
what Rathborne looks like.

34:16.803 --> 34:18.003
He shouldn't be
too hard to spot.

34:18.303 --> 34:19.969
Yeah, he'll be the one
who's trying to kill you.

34:21.071 --> 34:23.072
All right, let's go,
everybody.

34:23.072 --> 34:25.074
Be advised,
we are southbound Lafayette

34:25.074 --> 34:26.809
<i>approaching Worth.</i>

34:26.810 --> 34:30.079
Roger on Worth. Let me know
when you clear the intersection.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.415
We're through the intersection.
Continuing eastbound Worth.

34:33.416 --> 34:36.016
It's a solid plan.

34:36.016 --> 34:37.949
We're entering
the parking garage.

34:42.253 --> 34:42.853
Eyes out.

34:42.855 --> 34:45.089
This guy's supposed
to like close-up work.

35:03.238 --> 35:06.706
Be advised.
We are now on foot.

35:14.012 --> 35:17.947
Rathborne's making his move.

35:22.486 --> 35:23.987
On the ground!

35:23.988 --> 35:26.188
Drop it! Drop it!
Don't move!

35:26.189 --> 35:28.256
What the hell's
wrong with you?

35:28.257 --> 35:29.758
It's a phone.

35:29.759 --> 35:32.527
Disregard. Disregard.
It's not him.

35:32.528 --> 35:36.397
We must have spooked him.
Rathborne didn't show.

35:49.085 --> 35:49.949
I let her down.

35:51.050 --> 35:52.283
No, you didn't.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.785
Rathborne's in the wind.
Dick Coonan's about to walk.

35:58.155 --> 35:59.355
I missed something.

35:59.356 --> 36:00.256
Could've been me.

36:01.557 --> 36:03.124
Rathborne could've checked
the routing number,

36:03.125 --> 36:06.528
Realized the money was coming
from my account, not Dick's.

36:06.629 --> 36:07.731
I was arrogant.

36:07.732 --> 36:09.432
I didn't think
you were arrogant, Castle.

36:09.632 --> 36:11.166
I thought what you did
was sweet.

36:11.467 --> 36:13.735
And I will pay you back as--
Negative, ghostrider.

36:13.836 --> 36:16.337
Small price to pay for a shot
at your mother's killer.

36:20.006 --> 36:21.440
Her killer?

36:21.441 --> 36:23.275
What?

36:23.276 --> 36:27.646
<i>Coonan said it was
100 grand to catch her killer.</i>

36:27.647 --> 36:30.184
And you never told him it was
your mother that was murdered.

36:30.685 --> 36:33.385
There was no Rathborne.
That was just a cover.

36:33.386 --> 36:35.387
It was you.

36:37.323 --> 36:39.891
Clever girl.

36:40.592 --> 36:42.193
Aah!

36:42.194 --> 36:45.029
All right.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

36:45.030 --> 36:46.697
Now here's
what's gonna happen.

36:46.998 --> 36:50.967
We're just gonna stroll on over
to the elevator together,

36:50.968 --> 36:52.735
nice and easy.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.370
That'll never happen.

36:55.571 --> 36:58.139
You make a sound,
you attempt a signal,

36:58.140 --> 37:00.242
you so much
as clear your throat,

37:00.243 --> 37:02.310
and I'll put a round
in this man's liver.

37:02.311 --> 37:06.214
And he will die slowly
and in considerable pain.

37:06.215 --> 37:08.982
Aah.

37:08.783 --> 37:11.151
Let's go.

37:17.391 --> 37:20.626
What, no pithy remarks
from the peanut gallery?

37:20.627 --> 37:23.029
Not so funny facing
your own death, is it?

37:23.030 --> 37:25.531
I don't know, Dick.
You tell me.

37:25.532 --> 37:28.534
Last time I checked,
this was a police station.

37:28.535 --> 37:30.570
You knew before
I arrested you, didn't you?

37:30.571 --> 37:32.272
You knew
my mom was your victim.

37:32.873 --> 37:35.774
It wasn't personal, okay?
She was just another job.

37:35.775 --> 37:39.343
She was my mother.
Who hired you to kill her?

37:39.444 --> 37:41.712
Forget it.
You'll never touch 'em.

37:41.913 --> 37:43.814
They'll bury you.
Tell me who.

37:43.815 --> 37:45.750
No. No. No! Sir!

37:45.851 --> 37:48.122
I need him alive.
That's right. You do need me.

37:48.123 --> 37:50.123
Now back him off,
or Castle dies.

37:51.323 --> 37:53.490
Sir, back of please.

37:54.091 --> 37:55.559
You know I can't do that.

37:55.560 --> 37:56.593
Hey.

37:56.594 --> 37:58.063
You want to learn who ordered
the hit on your mommy?

37:58.064 --> 38:00.732
You better make sure
I make it outta here.

38:07.336 --> 38:10.505
Roy... please.

38:14.309 --> 38:18.111
That's right Roy.
Nice and easy.

38:18.112 --> 38:19.547
