00:04.104 --> 00:06.773
{\an5}<i>Previously on</i> Good Sam...

00:04.104 --> 00:06.773
I'm done

00:06.840 --> 00:07.774
fighting you for the chief job.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.642
I'm out. Hurting you was

00:09.709 --> 00:11.211
a wake-up call for me,
Malcolm.

00:11.277 --> 00:13.380
{\an1}For what it's worth, I think
you would have beat him.

00:13.446 --> 00:16.349
{\an5}What are you saying?

00:13.446 --> 00:16.349
I love you.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.184
{\an3}Why does he sound like
he's transitioning

00:18.251 --> 00:19.185
to active labor?

00:19.252 --> 00:20.754
{\an1}My new husband has
some techniques

00:20.820 --> 00:22.555
{\an1}to help me deal with
my old husband.

00:22.622 --> 00:23.556
{\an3}Your father dropped
an instrument

00:23.623 --> 00:24.624
in the middle of surgery.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.460
{\an1}That scalpel's not
the only thing he's dropped.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.129
I know about the headaches

00:29.195 --> 00:30.397
and the ringing in your ears.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.531
{\an1}Thanks for telling me
about this.

00:32.598 --> 00:34.267
{\an3}Thanks for telling me
about his symptoms.

00:36.569 --> 00:38.571
(machine humming)

00:47.280 --> 00:49.749
{\an5}WOMAN:
<i>There, in the bilateral</i>
<i>hemispheres.</i>

00:49.816 --> 00:51.451
WOMAN 2:
<i>He's got a couple months, ma.</i>

00:51.518 --> 00:54.120
<i>This is a death sentence.</i>

00:59.692 --> 01:01.594
{\an3}You okay?

01:01.661 --> 01:04.497
Yeah. It was... it was a dream.

01:04.563 --> 01:07.400
Yeah, a bad one.
You're sweating.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.171
{\an3}You want to try
and lay back down?

01:11.237 --> 01:13.807
{\an1}You know, I, uh,
think I'm gonna go in.

01:13.873 --> 01:15.708
{\an5}What, now?

01:13.873 --> 01:15.708
Radiology said

01:15.775 --> 01:17.811
{\an1}they'd have the results
by today.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.316
{\an5}Babe.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.316
{\an1}Mm.

01:23.383 --> 01:25.084
{\an3}No one's going to see
your results

01:25.151 --> 01:26.486
until at least 9:00.

01:26.553 --> 01:28.822
{\an1}Well, I'll be there
when they do.

01:28.888 --> 01:30.423
Look, it's still dark out.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.859
{\an3}Come on, get
back into bed.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.395
{\an1}(groans)

01:35.462 --> 01:37.197
{\an3}Come on.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.534
Or we can go in.

01:46.806 --> 01:48.508
I got your text.

01:48.575 --> 01:49.876
You've been here all night?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.377
Pretty much.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.579
Dr. Osmond just got in.

01:52.645 --> 01:53.880
{\an3}They're going over
the results now.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.148
{\an4}Okay.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.148
well, he, uh,

01:55.215 --> 01:57.183
wants to hear himself first.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.885
Why not just
go to Radiology?

01:58.952 --> 02:01.254
He didn't want to
raise suspicions.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.189
{\an3}TINA:
Dr. Griffith.

02:03.256 --> 02:06.659
{\an1}I think it's a little late
for that now.

02:06.726 --> 02:09.195
Ms. Kingsley.
What can I do for you?

02:09.262 --> 02:11.464
I was hoping we could speak.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.600
Perhaps in your office?

02:13.666 --> 02:15.802
Uh, my office is in use.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.403
My father's borrowing it
for a meeting.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.506
{\an5}Borrowing it?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.506
Yes.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.275
{\an1}Well, technically,
I am borrowing it from him,

02:22.342 --> 02:23.776
{\an1}since it was his office
in the first place

02:23.843 --> 02:26.479
{\an1}and will be again
when he's reinstated.

02:26.546 --> 02:27.714
If he's reinstated.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.816
Ah. What's this?

02:29.883 --> 02:31.551
Applicants for the chief
position.

02:31.618 --> 02:32.752
It's a very competitive list.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.387
I thought you'd like
to take a look in case

02:34.454 --> 02:36.189
a particular candidate
stood out to you.

02:36.256 --> 02:39.359
I'll be putting my full support
behind my father.

02:39.425 --> 02:41.628
{\an5}So you're not even gonna
take a look at it?

02:39.425 --> 02:41.628
{\an1}No.

02:41.694 --> 02:43.830
He is the right chief
for this department.

02:43.897 --> 02:46.566
Assuming he passes
all remaining assessments.

02:46.633 --> 02:47.700
Of course.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.602
Have a good day, doctors.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.573
{\an5}Thank you. You too.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.573
{\an3}Mm.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.742
(door opens)

02:55.808 --> 02:57.577
{\an5}Oh.

02:55.808 --> 02:57.577
{\an3}Oh.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.847
Well, what'd he say?

03:00.914 --> 03:04.417
He, uh... says it's nothing.

03:04.484 --> 03:07.186
No tumor, no inflammation,

03:07.253 --> 03:08.555
no discernable abnormality
of any kind.

03:08.621 --> 03:09.889
Well, that's good news.

03:09.956 --> 03:11.925
Depends how you look at it.

03:13.826 --> 03:15.595
Dad, this is a relief.

03:15.662 --> 03:19.966
{\an5}It would be if it made
my symptoms magically disappear.

03:15.662 --> 03:19.966
{\an3}(sighs)

03:20.033 --> 03:22.669
I still get ringing in my ears
and blinded by the light.

03:22.735 --> 03:25.305
Got headaches. Whatever it is,
it's not nothing.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.273
Okay, but it's also
not a brain tumor.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.976
{\an5}Black mold, gas leaks,
venomous snakes.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.976
{\an3}Oh...

03:30.043 --> 03:31.911
{\an5}Many, many types of cancer.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.911
What is he doing?

03:31.978 --> 03:34.480
He is listing things
that are not brain tumors

03:34.547 --> 03:35.648
but will still kill you.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.383
We're gonna figure out
what this is.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.618
{\an5}And how to treat it.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.618
{\an1}Exactly.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.687
{\an1}We have to exhaust
all options,

03:40.753 --> 03:42.822
{\an5}like you always say.

03:40.753 --> 03:42.822
You do always say that.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.857
To the residents.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.459
We're not running
a differential here.

03:46.526 --> 03:49.729
Maybe we should be.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.798
♪ ♪

04:00.940 --> 04:02.976
{\an8}All right, who is ready for

04:03.042 --> 04:05.712
{\an8}a little continuing
medical education?

04:05.778 --> 04:08.915
{\an8}CME for breakfast. Goody.

04:05.778 --> 04:08.915
{\an8}You know it.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.783
{\an8}Today's hypothetical patient

04:10.850 --> 04:12.719
{\an9}is male,
late 50s.

04:12.785 --> 04:14.821
{\an8}He suffers from
acute headaches,

04:14.887 --> 04:16.022
{\an9}photophobia,
metallic taste

04:16.089 --> 04:17.557
{\an8}and tinnitus.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.492
{\an9}Onset of symptoms
was sudden

04:19.559 --> 04:22.295
{\an8}and simultaneous. Go.

04:22.362 --> 04:23.930
{\an7}Is the tinnitus unilateral
or bilateral?

04:23.997 --> 04:28.368
{\an8}It is unilateral
to the right ear.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.436
{\an8}Does he have any other
vascular issues?

04:30.503 --> 04:33.573
{\an8}Not that we know of.

04:30.503 --> 04:33.573
{\an8}Why do you ask?

04:33.640 --> 04:35.875
{\an8}Tinnitus is the perception
of sound where there isn't any

04:35.942 --> 04:38.945
{\an8}or an internal sound
caused by abnormal blood flow.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.747
{\an8}The comorbid headaches suggest
it's a structural issue.

04:40.813 --> 04:41.848
{\an9}ISAN:
Like a lesion on the brain stem

04:41.914 --> 04:44.851
{\an8}or cerebellum, maybe.

04:41.914 --> 04:44.851
{\an8}The brain scans were clear.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.986
{\an8}Well, what about
his HPA profile?

04:47.053 --> 04:48.554
{\an8}Adrenal fatigue
can cause anything

04:48.621 --> 04:50.657
{\an8}from insomnia to hair loss.

04:50.723 --> 04:51.891
{\an8}JOEY: It would explain
the light sensitivity.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.661
{\an8}Doesn't explain
the metallic taste.

04:54.727 --> 04:56.329
{\an8}Maybe the link is the central
nervous system.

04:56.396 --> 04:59.032
{\an8}MS or Bell's palsy have been
known to affect sense of taste.

04:59.098 --> 05:00.633
{\an8}Or it's just a virus

05:00.700 --> 05:02.068
{\an8}or a side effect
to a medication.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.636
{\an8}JOEY: Or halitosis.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.538
{\an8}So the patient's old
and has bad breath.

05:05.605 --> 05:08.307
{\an8}That's the differential?

05:15.782 --> 05:18.484
{\an8}He also gets nightmares.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.453
{\an8}You know, I chalked up
last night's to stress,

05:20.520 --> 05:21.954
{\an8}waiting for his MRI results.

05:22.021 --> 05:23.790
{\an8}But it's not an isolated event.

05:23.856 --> 05:25.658
{\an8}Nightmares, insomnia.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.760
{\an8}Interrupted REM cycles.

05:27.827 --> 05:28.928
{\an8}What if it's another symptom?

05:28.995 --> 05:31.330
{\an8}I'd have to know more about
his typical sleep patterns

05:31.397 --> 05:33.466
{\an9}before I could
evaluate an anomaly.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.935
{\an7}Easy. I'll start tracking it.
I'm with him every night.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.739
{\an8}Sorry. I know it's...

05:37.170 --> 05:39.739
{\an9}No, it's...

05:39.806 --> 05:41.040
{\an8}I'm glad you told me.

05:41.107 --> 05:42.642
{\an9}If you being with
him can help us

05:42.709 --> 05:43.843
{\an9}figure out what's
going on here,

05:43.910 --> 05:45.111
{\an8}then it is a good thing.

05:46.479 --> 05:48.748
{\an8}At least it's better
than a brain tumor.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.886

05:56.456 --> 05:58.424
{\an8}Oh, Sally Rittenberg.

{\an9}The heart transplant
from August.

{\an8}Oh, I love a good
thank-you basket.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.496

{\an8}DONNA: Put it down, Dr. Costa.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.432

{\an8}How many tongue depressors

06:11.070 --> 06:13.873
{\an7}Are you playing,
Dr. Griffith?

06:13.940 --> 06:17.777
{\an7}There's a, uh, gift certificate
for a couples massage.

06:17.844 --> 06:19.679
{\an8}Ah, well, thank you, Donna,

06:19.746 --> 06:21.414

{\an8}of an actual couple.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.550
{\an8}Strongly agree.

{\an8}Oh, so, uh,

{\an7}you and Malcolm

{\an1}fine, I'm not, but it's...
(clears throat)

06:36.929 --> 06:39.432
It's not about me. I'm gonna
keep my feelings to myself.

06:39.499 --> 06:42.401

Oh, no, I didn't assume...

06:45.671 --> 06:47.707
{\an1}Yeah, 'cause, you know,
what we have works,

06:47.774 --> 06:49.776
No, we don't.

{\an3}Nope, we wouldn't.
Same page.

Yeah.

Thank you. Hello.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.791
Everyone, this is Amy Taylor.

07:04.857 --> 07:05.892
She suffers lightheadedness,

07:05.958 --> 07:08.060
shortness of breath
and nausea.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.096
{\an1}Yeah, my doctor says
I need a bypass.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.799
Well, given your angiogram,
I'm inclined to agree.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.768
These are all common symptoms
of coronary artery disease.

07:15.835 --> 07:18.471
{\an1}Is there a family history of
heart disease that you know of?

07:18.538 --> 07:20.473
{\an1}No, but if you shake my family
tree, bottles fall out.

07:20.540 --> 07:21.607
Me included.

07:21.674 --> 07:23.476
She is three years sober.

07:23.543 --> 07:25.812
{\an5}Three years sober,
that's impressive.

07:23.543 --> 07:25.812
{\an1}Thank you.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.880
{\an1}Yeah, well, I put my sister
through so much hell

07:27.947 --> 07:29.682
before I quit drinking
Gretchen still carries

07:29.749 --> 07:31.117
{\an5}a breathalyzer in her purse.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.117
{\an3}Stop it.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.886
{\an3}That's just a reminder
of how happy I am

07:33.953 --> 07:35.121
{\an5}that you're sober.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.121
Thanks, sis.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.989
{\an1}(chuckles)
I feel sick.

07:37.056 --> 07:40.660
Oh, well, surgery should
alleviate your symptoms...

07:40.726 --> 07:42.995
{\an4}No, I mean right now, I...
I feel sick

07:40.726 --> 07:42.995
A headache...

07:43.062 --> 07:45.464
Oh! Oh, honey.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.867
{\an6}SAM:
Let's get her on a drip
of pantoprazole

07:47.934 --> 07:49.802
{\an3}and get her crossed and typed
for two units of blood.

07:49.869 --> 07:52.138
{\an5}Oh, here we go again.

07:49.869 --> 07:52.138
This has happened before?

{\an5}I'll call Markov in G.I.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.907
Why? I thought you said
nausea was a common symptom.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.242
Narrowed arteries
don't cause blood

07:56.309 --> 07:57.243
to enter the G.I. tract.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.645
{\an3}SAM:
Yeah, whatever this is,

07:59.712 --> 08:01.647
heart surgery's
not gonna fix it.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.853
(knocking)

08:06.919 --> 08:08.221
You wanted to see me?

08:08.287 --> 08:09.755
Yeah. Close the door.

08:11.624 --> 08:14.193
I want to apologize for the way
I handled the clinic proposal.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.529
I never should have
pressured you

08:16.596 --> 08:19.265
to backchannel
with your father, and I'm, uh,

08:19.332 --> 08:21.801
I'm sorry it blew up on you
the way that it did.

08:21.868 --> 08:24.537
Well, truth is
I probably would have

08:24.604 --> 08:25.404
went to him anyway.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.506
{\an3}If this clinic could
be something great

08:27.573 --> 08:30.076
{\an3}for the community,
I'd hate to give up on it.

08:30.142 --> 08:33.645
But we both know your father
will never support it, so...

08:33.712 --> 08:34.714
What if my mom did?

08:35.847 --> 08:38.083
Your mother?

08:38.150 --> 08:41.187
She was a force to be
reckoned with back in the day.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.788
You think she still is?

08:42.855 --> 08:44.957
Do I think she can overrule him
on the clinic?

08:45.024 --> 08:46.525
Yeah.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.194
{\an1}This would infuriate
your father.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.997
{\an1}I... To go around him to Tina,
of all people?

08:51.063 --> 08:52.198
Look, I wouldn't
have to do it

08:52.265 --> 08:53.900
if he'd heard me out
in the first place.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.237
This is the nuclear option.

08:58.304 --> 09:02.241
{\an3}All right, well...
let's hope it works.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.147
(door closes)

09:08.981 --> 09:12.752
{\an3}Okay, Vinit Jain,
four-centimeter

09:12.818 --> 09:15.321
{\an1}low-grade glioma in the left
lateral posterior frontal lobe.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.790
{\an1}Scheduled for an awake
craniotomy. And why is that?

09:17.857 --> 09:19.725
{\an1}Because it gives us
the opportunity

09:19.792 --> 09:21.661
to map the brain
and avoid areas

09:21.727 --> 09:22.895
{\an1}that are critical for
normal speech function.

09:22.962 --> 09:23.796
{\an3}And what's
the difference

09:23.863 --> 09:26.299
{\an1}between this craniotomy
and a craniectomy?

09:26.365 --> 09:28.768
{\an5}Uh...

09:26.365 --> 09:28.768
{\an1}In this procedure,
once the scalp

09:28.834 --> 09:30.636
is opened and clipped,
the brain flap

09:30.703 --> 09:31.904
{\an5}(indistinct conversation)

09:30.703 --> 09:31.904
that's removed
from the patient's skull

09:31.971 --> 09:33.739
{\an1}is replaced at the end
of the surgery.

09:33.806 --> 09:34.907
Correct again.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.709
Dr. Costa, you just
earned yourself

09:36.776 --> 09:37.777
a spot in my OR.

09:37.843 --> 09:39.879
See you soon, Mr. Jain.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.118
It sounds scary, but we
do these all the time.

09:46.185 --> 09:47.687
You're in good hands.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.723
{\an8}Uh...

09:54.827 --> 09:56.796
You studied just
as hard as I did.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.031
{\an1}Why didn't you answer
any of Dr. Lee's questions?

09:59.098 --> 10:01.033
I wanted to.
I tried to.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.702
{\an3}But then there's
this voice in my head

10:02.768 --> 10:04.770
{\an5}telling me I'm a fraud.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.770
A fraud?

10:04.837 --> 10:06.939
Like, if that family
knew the truth about

10:07.006 --> 10:08.774
{\an1}the patient I lost,
they wouldn't want me

10:08.841 --> 10:11.243
{\an5}for a doctor.

10:08.841 --> 10:11.243
{\an3}Ah, yes.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.379
{\an1}I'm supposed to say
something encouraging

10:13.446 --> 10:14.780
right now, aren't I?

10:14.847 --> 10:15.748
Okay.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.950
Friend moment.
You got this. You can do it.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.885
{\an5}Believe in yourself.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.885
{\an1}Sorry,

10:19.952 --> 10:21.620
{\an5}are you talking to me?

10:19.952 --> 10:21.620
{\an3}What?

10:21.687 --> 10:22.922
{\an1}I can't tell who
this pep talk is for.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.924
Oh, no, you don't
need a pep talk.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.125
{\an3}You need to put what happened
behind you, 'cause there's

10:26.192 --> 10:28.728
{\an3}no room for self-doubt
in surgery. (gasps)

10:28.794 --> 10:30.629
That was good.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.798
{\an3}Oh, I've got
Amy Taylor's results.

10:32.865 --> 10:33.833
We should know
what's going on

10:33.899 --> 10:34.900
in her stomach soon.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.236
{\an1}Let's hope it's a peptic ulcer
and not a perforation.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.306
Hey, I, uh...

10:40.373 --> 10:42.341
{\an3}I've been thinking about
what you told me.

10:42.408 --> 10:43.342
The nightmares.

10:43.409 --> 10:46.145
{\an3}And I did a search of
national health surveys.

10:46.212 --> 10:48.314
{\an3}I-I looked at cross-sections
to see if there was

10:48.381 --> 10:50.416
{\an3}a relationship between
sleep disorders

10:50.483 --> 10:52.051
and symptoms like my dad's.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.886
And all the evidence suggests

10:53.953 --> 10:56.756
that his condition
is psychological.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.792
Well, depression and anxiety
account for more symptoms

10:59.859 --> 11:02.161
{\an5}than they get credit for,
that's for sure.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.161
{\an3}Exactly.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.030
And considering what
he's been through,

11:04.096 --> 11:04.964
it makes sense.

11:05.031 --> 11:06.932
You think it's connected
to his shooting?

11:06.999 --> 11:10.269
Or the patient we lost.
The gunshot victim.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.204
Maybe that triggered something
for my dad.

11:12.271 --> 11:14.440
That sounds like PTSD.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.343
PTSD?
For survivors of war

11:17.410 --> 11:18.811
and natural disaster.

11:18.878 --> 11:21.180
{\an5}You were shot.
I think that qualifies.

11:18.878 --> 11:21.180
{\an1}Yeah.

11:21.247 --> 11:24.250
No. It does not explain
my symptoms.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.318
Then let us rule it out
with an expert opinion.

11:27.753 --> 11:28.554
{\an3}If we're wrong, a mental
health professional

11:28.621 --> 11:31.190
{\an5}will eliminate it.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.190
And if we're right,

11:31.257 --> 11:33.859
you'll have answers.
Treatment options.

11:33.926 --> 11:36.028
Dad, one appointment.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.430
If Tina Kingsley found out

11:37.496 --> 11:40.066
I'd volunteered
for a psych eval...

11:40.132 --> 11:41.834
She will not find out.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.335
You underestimate her.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.137
It just has to be
someone we trust.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.205
Like who?

11:46.272 --> 11:47.940
{\an3}(sighs)

11:49.942 --> 11:51.944
Welcome. Come on in.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.985
PYNE:
<i>I applaud you for coming in.</i>

12:00.052 --> 12:02.788
It takes a lot
to ask for help.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.924
{\an3}Well, we want to exhaust
all the options.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.892
{\an1}Well, this is exhausting
so far.

12:06.959 --> 12:10.162
{\an3}What my father means to say
is thank you

12:10.229 --> 12:12.098
for making time for us,

12:12.164 --> 12:13.065
given your busy schedule.

12:13.132 --> 12:16.869
{\an1}Mm-hmm. And the obvious
conflict of interest.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.105
Us being family and all.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.973
{\an3}We are not.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.809
{\an1}Well, we both married
the same woman.

12:23.876 --> 12:25.778
{\an5}Not at the same time.

12:23.876 --> 12:25.778
(Sam sighs)

12:25.845 --> 12:29.115
{\an3}And everything you say in here
is confidential.

12:29.181 --> 12:31.917
So, how can I help you today?

12:33.552 --> 12:36.155
You can tell my daughter
that I do not have PTSD

12:36.222 --> 12:38.457
{\an5}as a result of being shot.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.457
{\an3}I see.

12:38.524 --> 12:42.027
Well, you list an array
of symptoms here.

12:42.094 --> 12:45.364
There's no chance they're
related to the shooting?

12:45.431 --> 12:49.168
{\an1}No. Physically,
I'm completely recovered.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.035
How about emotionally?

12:50.102 --> 12:51.871
{\an3}How do you feel
about the shooting?

12:51.937 --> 12:56.008
I feel that
it would have been better

12:56.075 --> 12:57.109
if he had missed.

12:57.176 --> 13:00.946
{\an3}I'm sorry, I don't know why
I expected this to work.

13:01.013 --> 13:02.181
If you're not even gonna try...

13:02.248 --> 13:03.516
{\an1}No chance that the shooting
could lead to this

13:03.582 --> 13:05.151
constellation of symptoms.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.286
{\an5}You don't know that.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.286
{\an1}Even Pyne agrees it's a stretch.
Right?

13:07.353 --> 13:09.788
{\an3}He can't agree until you talk
to him about your feelings.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.891
{\an6}PYNE:
What about your feelings?

13:09.855 --> 13:11.891
What?

13:11.957 --> 13:14.260
How did you feel
the day he was shot?

13:15.628 --> 13:18.497
Helpless.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.032
Terrified.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.170
{\an3}He knows the feeling.
He's been there.

13:24.236 --> 13:26.172
What do you mean?

13:26.238 --> 13:29.108
My accident.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.410
When I was a kid,

13:31.477 --> 13:34.180
he was driving, I got hurt.
I had to have surgery,

13:34.246 --> 13:35.447
and he couldn't be in it.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.016
{\an3}That's quite the
role reversal.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.585
So you both know
how it feels to be

13:39.652 --> 13:41.420
the victim
and the helpless bystander.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.990
The accident was a completely
different situation.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.258
How so?

13:48.093 --> 13:51.130
(siren wailing)

13:51.197 --> 13:53.532
(indistinct chatter)

13:55.935 --> 13:57.870
VIVIAN (echoing):
Sam!

14:05.444 --> 14:07.246
(indistinct radio transmission)

14:07.313 --> 14:09.548
(indistinct chatter)

14:15.054 --> 14:17.122
So you weren't locked out
of my surgery.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.624
You never made it
through the door?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.492
Are you saying
you were unable

14:20.559 --> 14:22.027
to come in the door?

14:22.094 --> 14:24.196
I'm saying that...

14:24.263 --> 14:26.865
{\an1}there was nothing
I could do.

14:26.932 --> 14:30.035
It was every parent's
worst nightmare.

14:30.102 --> 14:32.638
Do you still feel guilt
over what happened?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.440
Of course I do.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.041
Dad, it was an accident.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.877
{\an3}I have forgiven him
for this.

14:38.944 --> 14:40.879
Have you forgiven yourself,
Griff?

14:44.016 --> 14:47.486
(stammers, chuckles)

14:47.553 --> 14:50.122
Why are we talking about this?

14:50.189 --> 14:51.457
{\an1}You were supposed
to be confirming that

14:51.523 --> 14:54.226
the shooting didn't cause PTSD.

14:54.293 --> 14:57.296
I don't think the shooting is
the cause of your symptoms.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.065
{\an1}Thank you.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.001
{\an3}But the accident
could be.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.569
There's something
unresolved here,

15:03.636 --> 15:05.337
and I'd like to keep
talking about it.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.907
{\an1}Well, why don't you and Sam, uh,
schedule some time together?

15:08.974 --> 15:10.442
I'm talking about you.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.378
If your symptoms are
interfering with your work,

15:12.444 --> 15:14.380
{\an3}I'll have to submit
a formal recommendation

15:14.446 --> 15:17.616
for a mental health assessment
before you return to surgery.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.251
Yeah.

15:20.219 --> 15:21.654
Wow.

15:25.491 --> 15:26.425
Thank you for joining me.

15:26.492 --> 15:27.593
Thanks for inviting me.

15:27.660 --> 15:28.961
{\an1}There's no one I'd rather
do lunch with

15:29.028 --> 15:30.095
than my own son.

15:31.363 --> 15:34.700
{\an3}You know, I was hoping we could
do a little business as well.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.269
{\an5}I'm listening.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.269
{\an3}All right.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.938
Lakeshore could be doing
a lot more

15:40.005 --> 15:42.941
for underserved communities
in this area.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.710
Now, this clinic is the answer.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.047
{\an3}It just... it requires
some investment.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.182
Which is why your father
said no.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.651
And you never would have
brought this to me

15:52.718 --> 15:54.153
if you'd gotten a yes
out of him.

15:54.219 --> 15:57.056
Uh, yes.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.124
{\an3}But we haven't been
seeing eye to eye

15:59.191 --> 16:00.959
{\an3}ever since I started
dating Sam.

16:01.026 --> 16:02.995
I always wondered if
there was more to that story.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.364
Uh, well, that story is over.

16:05.431 --> 16:08.300
But this clinic is a good idea,

16:08.367 --> 16:10.169
and it can be good
for Lakeshore.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.137
I agree. I'll talk
to the board about it.

16:12.204 --> 16:14.740
{\an6}Really?

16:12.204 --> 16:14.740
{\an1}Yes. I said I wanted to
help, and I meant it.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.310
As a matter of fact,
I was thinking

16:18.377 --> 16:19.645
we might help each other out.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.613
What do you mean?

16:21.680 --> 16:24.416
Rob Griffith is
hiding something.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.986
And before your father coronates
his golf buddy

16:28.053 --> 16:30.456
to run this hospital's most
prestigious department,

16:30.522 --> 16:32.358
I'd like to know what it is.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.494
I don't think I should
get between you and Dad.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.463
If Dr. Griffith is
unfit for the job,

16:37.529 --> 16:38.764
the scandal that could result
will end up

16:38.831 --> 16:41.433
on your résumé, too.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.203
That story you told me
about his daughter and you,

16:44.269 --> 16:45.571
how over is it?

16:49.074 --> 16:51.210
{\an1}I knew it was a waste of time
going to Pyne,

16:51.276 --> 16:52.711
{\an1}and now he's threatening
to expose me.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.613
{\an3}He just wants you
to come back.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.248
{\an3}And if Pyne thinks
he can help you,

16:56.315 --> 16:57.449
{\an5}why not try?

16:56.315 --> 16:57.449
(pager beeping)

16:57.516 --> 16:59.752
(groans)

16:59.818 --> 17:02.388
{\an3}Amy's X-ray showed free air
under her diaphragm.

17:02.454 --> 17:04.757
{\an5}It's a perforation.

17:02.454 --> 17:04.757
{\an3}Markov's in there doing
a laparotomy now.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.224
Given her cardiomyopathy,

17:06.290 --> 17:07.760
I got to be in there
to monitor her heart.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.462
{\an1}You don't want to stay and talk
about our feelings some more?

17:10.529 --> 17:12.330
{\an3}Bye, Dad.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.334
Three years sober,

17:15.401 --> 17:16.801
{\an3}but what's making her
throw up blood?

17:16.868 --> 17:19.471
{\an1}Well, that's what we're here
to find out, Dr. Tucker.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.074
{\an1}Let's proceed with
the laparotomy.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.542
How's it going with
the other patient?

17:24.609 --> 17:26.612
Pyne thinks it could be PTSD,

17:26.678 --> 17:28.747
but not from the shooting.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.051
{\an5}The accident.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.051
It was traumatic,

17:33.118 --> 17:34.820
{\an1}but it was also
20 years ago.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.622
Yeah, but when I was
in the Air Force,

17:36.688 --> 17:39.691
they used to talk about
delayed onset PTSD.

17:39.758 --> 17:42.561
{\an1}You could be a retired colonel,
then something triggers you,

17:42.628 --> 17:45.464
sends you right back
to your first tour.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.399
But what could be
triggering him?

17:47.466 --> 17:49.301
If it's not losing
the gunshot patient,

17:49.368 --> 17:52.137
I-I just don't understand
what's making these symptoms

17:52.204 --> 17:53.739
crop up now.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.775
He's the only one
who could answer that.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.144
Well, he's gonna have to
keep going to therapy.

17:59.211 --> 18:00.379
Pre-pyloric gastric ulcer.

18:00.446 --> 18:01.847
CALEB:
It's fully perforated.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.117
{\an3}Well, that explains the bleeding
in the abdominal cavity.

18:05.184 --> 18:06.552
Let's get her stitched up.

18:06.618 --> 18:09.588
Hey, what about this here,
near the fundus?

18:13.358 --> 18:15.461
Gastric varices.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.196
Those aren't related
to the perforation

18:17.262 --> 18:18.263
or the heart condition.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.332
{\an1}These mean Amy's liver
is failing.

18:20.399 --> 18:21.800
{\an3}LEX:
Didn't she say she's sober?

18:21.867 --> 18:22.835
Yeah.

18:22.901 --> 18:23.669
Could be a relapse.

18:23.735 --> 18:26.138
{\an3}I mean, that damage
is pretty bad.

18:28.173 --> 18:30.809
Once she's out of surgery,
let's get to the bottom of this.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.546
{\an3}Hey.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.515
Hi.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.116
How are things
with your dad,

18:38.183 --> 18:39.451
now that you're out
of the chief race?

18:39.518 --> 18:41.887
Oh, they're okay.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.723
{\an1}You know,
he's still my dad.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.792
{\an3}Yeah.
(chuckles)

18:48.660 --> 18:51.530
He's, uh, he's doing well?

18:51.597 --> 18:54.466
{\an1}You think he's ready to
step back in?

18:56.201 --> 18:58.804
{\an5}Why do you ask?

18:56.201 --> 18:58.804
What do you mean?

18:58.871 --> 19:01.573
I mean, this is the first time
you've asked a question

19:01.640 --> 19:03.742
about my dad
since he was in a coma.

19:03.809 --> 19:07.346
Does giving things a shot with
your mom mean snooping for her?

19:07.412 --> 19:09.147
{\an1}I just want to know
if you think

19:09.214 --> 19:10.649
your dad is up for the job.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.784
{\an3}My father is undergoing
proctorship.

19:12.851 --> 19:15.454
{\an3}It would be premature of me
to tell you what I think.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.856
{\an3}And frankly, it is unethical
of you to even ask.

19:17.923 --> 19:20.392
Okay.

19:20.459 --> 19:21.793
Sorry I brought it up.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.762
Yeah, me, too.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.931
Tell your mom thanks
for the concern.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.833
(door closes)

19:29.701 --> 19:31.870
{\an3}Thought you'd be counting
tongue depressors.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.273
I got my guess in early.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.276
{\an1}Overthinking is
a classic mistake.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.279
Over-practice,
on the other hand...

19:43.315 --> 19:44.416
{\an1}I'm trying to get
the whole pride flag

19:44.483 --> 19:45.684
before the real surgery.

19:45.751 --> 19:48.453
Dr. Shah, a word?

19:51.523 --> 19:53.625
{\an3}You've been a little slow
to answer questions on rounds.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.961
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll step it up.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.331
{\an3}I hope you do, because
the surgery's yours.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.266
Dr. Costa, you're out.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.301
{\an4}What?

20:01.333 --> 20:02.301
What?

20:02.367 --> 20:04.336
Patient requested you.

20:04.403 --> 20:05.470
What? Like, by name?

20:05.537 --> 20:07.339
He asked for the Indian doctor,

20:07.406 --> 20:09.474
I surmised the rest.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.377
{\an3}And, uh, those brain models
cost a thousand dollars each,

20:12.444 --> 20:14.413
{\an3}Dr. Costa.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.252
{\an3}(chuckles):
Oh.

20:20.319 --> 20:21.753
{\an3}So Amy Taylor's labs
are back.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.455
All the cultures are negative.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.624
Are there any medications
she could be reacting to?

20:25.691 --> 20:27.893
Not according to this.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.895
{\an3}(groans)

20:32.297 --> 20:34.299
I want to be there.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.602
{\an3}If this is a relapse,
it could be helpful

20:36.668 --> 20:37.936
to have someone in the room

20:38.003 --> 20:39.504
{\an3}who can relate to
her experience.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.007
{\an3}Plus, it gets me out
of my head.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.676
I appreciate that,
but I don't want to

20:44.743 --> 20:46.511
make things more difficult
for you.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.313
You have your sobriety
to think about...

20:48.380 --> 20:49.481
I am thinking about it.

20:49.548 --> 20:50.916
Showing up for other people

20:50.983 --> 20:52.818
{\an5}helps me stay sober.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.818
{\an1}Really?

20:52.884 --> 20:54.786
{\an1}Okay.

20:54.853 --> 20:56.588
{\an1}In that case, I'd love
to have you there.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.791
{\an6}All right, let's go
talk to Amy.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.791
{\an1}Okay.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.360
So let me get this straight.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.362
{\an1}You fixed her stomach
a few hours ago,

21:03.428 --> 21:05.831
and now her liver is failing.
What's causing that?

21:05.897 --> 21:09.001
We have the same question,
actually.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.969
The tests for hepatitis
came back negative,

21:11.036 --> 21:13.905
and that is one of the two
most common causes.

21:13.972 --> 21:14.940
What's the other one?

21:15.007 --> 21:17.976
{\an4}Alcohol.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.976
(hiccups)

21:18.043 --> 21:21.747
No. She is three years sober.

21:21.813 --> 21:24.650
Amy, can you tell them that
you haven't been drinking?

21:24.716 --> 21:28.520
No, Officer,
I'm <i> serfectly pober.</i>

21:29.421 --> 21:31.923
{\an1}This is the anesthesia.
She hasn't been drinking.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.692
{\an3}She wouldn't do that.
So what would you like?

21:33.759 --> 21:34.793
{\an3}Would you like for us
to prove it?

21:34.860 --> 21:35.861
{\an5}We can do that.

21:34.860 --> 21:35.861
AMY: Prove it.

21:35.927 --> 21:37.763
{\an6}Come on.

21:35.927 --> 21:37.763
Yes, come on.

21:37.829 --> 21:38.930
{\an5}Okay.

21:37.829 --> 21:38.930
(device beeps)

21:38.997 --> 21:40.532
Honey.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.768
{\an1}AMY:
Yeah.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.870
(device beeps)

21:46.505 --> 21:47.639
{\an3}.09.

21:47.706 --> 21:50.609
Over the legal limit
to drive.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.780
Ah, this is unbelievable. Uh...

21:54.846 --> 21:56.748
{\an5}I didn't drink.

21:54.846 --> 21:56.748
{\an3}Amy...

21:56.815 --> 21:59.985
I... I cannot even count
how many times

22:00.052 --> 22:01.219
I've been woken up
at 2:00 in the morning

22:01.286 --> 22:03.722
{\an1}to bail her out of a bar fight,
or how many times I've turned

22:03.789 --> 22:05.557
my house upside down
to find her stash.

22:05.624 --> 22:06.792
{\an5}No, I didn't drink.

22:05.624 --> 22:06.792
{\an3}Stop, stop!

22:06.858 --> 22:08.860
Don't. Just don't, okay?

22:08.927 --> 22:10.062
I could handle a relapse.

22:10.128 --> 22:12.597
I can't deal with
your lies anymore.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.700
I didn't drink.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.868
Sneaking booze into a hospital,
that's a new low.

22:16.935 --> 22:18.503
Gretchen, I didn't drink!

22:18.570 --> 22:20.872
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey. Whoa. Whoa.

22:20.939 --> 22:23.575
{\an5}Okay.

22:20.939 --> 22:23.575
Okay, easy, easy, easy, easy.

22:29.981 --> 22:31.383
{\an5}Hey, Mom, are you...

22:29.981 --> 22:31.383
{\an1}Sam.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.985
{\an5}Uh, I can come back.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.985
No, it's okay.

22:34.052 --> 22:35.520
{\an5}I should get to it.

22:34.052 --> 22:35.520
{\an1}Yeah.

22:35.587 --> 22:38.790
And, Malcolm, thank your mother
for me, will you?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.726
Yeah.

22:44.996 --> 22:45.864
{\an3}His mother?

22:45.931 --> 22:50.736
She's still very influential
around here.

22:50.802 --> 22:53.138
{\an3}Well, she is certainly
influencing Malcolm.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.841
{\an1}She's also raised concerns
about your father's competency.

22:55.907 --> 22:57.442
When were you gonna tell me

22:57.509 --> 22:59.144
{\an1}he dropped a scalpel
during surgery?

22:59.211 --> 23:00.879
<i>After</i> surgery.

23:00.946 --> 23:02.848
There's nothing to tell.

23:02.914 --> 23:04.049
We don't know what's
going on yet.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.084
He's only had one session
with Pyne.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.621
With Asher Pyne?

23:09.688 --> 23:11.990
{\an6}Uh...

23:09.688 --> 23:11.990
{\an1}My husband

23:12.057 --> 23:14.059
is treating my ex-husband?

23:14.126 --> 23:15.627
{\an3}Yeah.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.395
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

23:17.462 --> 23:20.432
{\an3}Dad might be exhibiting
symptoms of PTSD,

23:20.499 --> 23:21.867
{\an3}and he needed someone
to talk to.

23:21.933 --> 23:23.702
So you sent him to Asher.

23:23.769 --> 23:25.003
I needed someone
we could trust.

23:25.070 --> 23:28.607
And Asher thinks this is
related to the accident.

23:28.673 --> 23:30.942
I agree.

23:31.009 --> 23:33.111
Something in the present
is triggering

23:33.178 --> 23:34.846
past trauma for Dad.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.449
Like what?

23:37.516 --> 23:40.652
I don't know.
Maybe it's me.

23:40.719 --> 23:43.822
{\an1}You? You have been working
alongside him for years

23:43.889 --> 23:47.425
{\an1}and he has never exhibited
signs of PTSD.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.127
I've also never been
his boss before.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.730
Maybe it's messing
with his head.

23:51.797 --> 23:53.832
Whatever this is, sweetheart,

23:53.899 --> 23:56.168
you are not to blame.

23:56.234 --> 23:57.769
Well, we won't know that

23:57.836 --> 24:00.138
unless he goes back to therapy.

24:03.074 --> 24:04.776
I will talk to him.

24:04.843 --> 24:06.878
Thanks.

24:09.281 --> 24:13.718
Dr. Tucker! Did you
steal Donna's jar?

24:13.785 --> 24:16.188
{\an1}No, I'm replicating it
with some supplies I found

24:16.254 --> 24:18.456
{\an1}so I can make
the most accurate guess.

24:18.523 --> 24:19.791
{\an6}Hmm.

24:18.523 --> 24:19.791
{\an1}I think it's somewhere
between, like,

24:19.858 --> 24:21.159
{\an5}170 and 180...

24:19.858 --> 24:21.159
{\an3}(babbles)

24:21.226 --> 24:22.928
{\an3}I don't want any part
of this crime.

24:22.994 --> 24:24.896
{\an1}The only crime would be
letting Joey win

24:24.963 --> 24:25.931
that bottle of Cristal.

24:25.997 --> 24:27.799
Well, you're not gonna
drink it anyway, right?

24:27.866 --> 24:29.100
{\an1}You don't have to drink
to appreciate

24:29.167 --> 24:31.503
the favorite champagne
of Tsar Alexander II.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.004
{\an1}And they still make it
the same way.

24:33.071 --> 24:35.841
Same bottle, same grapes,
two fermentation periods.

24:35.907 --> 24:37.742
{\an1}You show up to any dinner party
with that baby,

24:37.809 --> 24:38.844
you're getting invited back.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.646
If Joey wins, he'll probably
drink it out of a hat.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.982
What did you just say?

24:44.049 --> 24:45.250
One of those hats, you know,

24:45.317 --> 24:47.018
{\an4}like, with the straws
that come down.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.018
{\an3}No, no.

24:47.085 --> 24:49.955
Fermentation.

24:50.021 --> 24:52.524
{\an3}The process by which yeast
converts sugar

24:52.591 --> 24:54.526
into ethynol and carbon dioxide.

24:54.593 --> 24:57.863
{\an5}Amy.

24:54.593 --> 24:57.863
{\an3}Amy.

24:57.929 --> 24:58.897
Wow.

24:58.964 --> 25:02.567
Amy's latest labs
show a blood alcohol of .11.

25:02.634 --> 25:05.170
{\an5}Well, she blew a .09
just a few hours ago.

25:02.634 --> 25:05.170
Mm-hmm.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.771
And she's been under
observation.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.173
Then how did she get more drunk?

25:08.240 --> 25:11.776
Because she's not sneaking it,
she's making it.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.179
{\an6}Where?

25:11.843 --> 25:14.179
In her own stomach.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.847
Auto-Brewery Syndrome.

25:15.914 --> 25:18.550
{\an5}CALEB:
A buildup of bacteria
or fungi in the stomach

25:18.617 --> 25:20.719
that ferments ingested
carbohydrates.

25:20.785 --> 25:22.621
{\an3}GRIFF:
It's extremely rare.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.890
It would explain the rising BAC.

25:24.956 --> 25:26.191
Let's schedule an endoscopy.

25:26.992 --> 25:27.959
Yeah.

25:31.663 --> 25:33.198
I hate this feeling.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.833
{\an1}I should have just
corrected the patient

25:34.900 --> 25:37.202
{\an4}the minute he assumed
I speak Hindi.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.202
Why didn't you?

25:37.269 --> 25:39.871
{\an1}Because it always
turns into a thing, you know?

25:39.938 --> 25:41.239
{\an1}With my last name
and how I look.

25:41.306 --> 25:43.141
{\an1}People have made this assumption
my whole life.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.943
I only complicate things
when I try to tell them

25:45.010 --> 25:47.112
{\an5}I'm half Spanish, too.

25:45.010 --> 25:47.112
Do you speak Spanish?

25:47.178 --> 25:49.714
{\an1}I didn't say I speak Spanish,
I said I'm half Spanish.

25:49.781 --> 25:51.116
Well, you're also part Indian,
and that part got you

25:51.182 --> 25:53.051
an awesome surgery--
embrace it.

25:53.118 --> 25:54.185
I'm being dishonest.

25:54.252 --> 25:55.720
{\an3}You are putting
the patient at ease.

25:55.787 --> 25:57.722
I tell patients I do Botox
before injecting them,

25:57.789 --> 25:58.990
even though this face
is all natural.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.927
{\an3}And Sam tells patients that
she had heart surgery as a kid.

26:01.993 --> 26:03.728
Sam did have heart surgery
as a kid.

26:03.795 --> 26:06.698
{\an3}Mm. Or maybe she's
just that good.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.303
Good luck.

26:11.369 --> 26:14.940
{\an3}Mr. Jain, I am going to send
an electrical current

26:15.006 --> 26:18.009
{\an3}to an area of your brain
and give you a command

26:18.076 --> 26:21.046
{\an3}so we know which sections
are safe to remove.

26:21.112 --> 26:23.014
Say yes if you understand.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.249
Yes.

26:25.784 --> 26:27.919
{\an3}Mr. Jain, can you
count to ten?

26:27.986 --> 26:31.222
One, two, three...

26:33.291 --> 26:35.026
Speech arrest.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.261
{\an3}We'll make sure we
avoid this area.

26:36.328 --> 26:37.929
{\an5}Keep him talking.

26:36.328 --> 26:37.929
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.801
{\an3}So, you know, I never asked.
Do you have any children?

26:42.867 --> 26:44.102
I do.

26:42.867 --> 26:44.102
{\an3}Mm.

26:44.169 --> 26:46.972
I have...

26:47.038 --> 26:49.641
<i>Mujhe bhukh lagi hai.</i>

26:49.708 --> 26:50.942
<i>Mujhe bohot bhukh lagi hai.</i>

26:51.009 --> 26:53.044
Secondary speech arrest.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.779
What did he say, Dr. Shah?

26:54.846 --> 26:56.915
Dr. Shah, is our patient
in distress?

26:56.982 --> 26:59.617
Uh, uh...

26:59.684 --> 27:02.120
I don't speak Hindi.

27:02.187 --> 27:04.889
That much was clear
from your terrible accent.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.958
{\an3}I'm sorry.

27:07.025 --> 27:08.126
I know you asked for me,

27:08.193 --> 27:10.929
{\an3}but I'm not the doctor
you think I am.

27:10.996 --> 27:15.000
I didn't ask for you because
we speak the same language.

27:15.066 --> 27:18.870
I did it because you put
your hand on my shoulder

27:18.937 --> 27:21.706
and made me feel like
I was going to be okay.

27:21.773 --> 27:26.044
You are exactly the doctor
I thought you were.

27:26.111 --> 27:28.113
{\an3}I'm so glad to
hear you say that.

27:28.179 --> 27:30.715
Stop. His lip is quivering.

27:30.782 --> 27:32.117
You're at the posterior
extent of speech,

27:32.183 --> 27:33.284
which means you've run into
the anterior region

27:33.351 --> 27:35.787
of the motor area.

27:36.788 --> 27:38.423
Now?

27:40.258 --> 27:41.659
Yeah.

27:41.726 --> 27:43.294
Excellent catch, Dr. Shah.

27:43.361 --> 27:44.662
Keep him talking.

27:44.729 --> 27:46.998
Since we are here
for a few hours,

27:47.065 --> 27:49.834
if you really don't know
any Hindi,

27:49.901 --> 27:52.170
would you like to learn some?

27:52.237 --> 27:54.239
Yeah, that sounds great.

27:57.275 --> 27:58.443
{\an5}Oh...

27:57.275 --> 27:58.443
Oh!

27:58.510 --> 28:01.746
You thought you had a brain
tumor and you didn't tell me!

28:01.813 --> 28:02.647
{\an3}Ah!

28:02.714 --> 28:04.282
{\an3}You know, you could
tell your husband

28:04.349 --> 28:05.950
{\an3}that's supposed to be
confidential.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.385
Asher didn't tell me that,
Sam did.

28:07.452 --> 28:10.155
She is blaming herself
for your PTSD.

28:10.221 --> 28:11.923
{\an5}I don't have PTSD.

28:10.221 --> 28:11.923
{\an1}Well, whatever you have.
For your symptoms.

28:11.990 --> 28:13.391
{\an5}She thinks she's triggering it.

28:11.990 --> 28:13.391
Why would she think that?

28:13.458 --> 28:14.993
{\an5}I don't know.

28:13.458 --> 28:14.993
The only thing worse
than these symptoms

28:15.060 --> 28:16.761
{\an3}is that she would
blame herself.

28:16.828 --> 28:18.063
If this really is
about the accident,

28:18.129 --> 28:19.464
I think we both know
what triggered it.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.999
Oh, come on, Viv.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.734
We thought she found this.

28:22.801 --> 28:24.903
We said we would continue
to keep it a secret,

28:24.969 --> 28:26.271
and then you started
having symptoms.

28:26.337 --> 28:28.206
That's a coincidence.
That's all it is.

28:28.273 --> 28:29.874
It has nothing to do
with it at all.

28:29.941 --> 28:30.942
You can't know that.
You can't know until

28:31.009 --> 28:33.044
{\an1}you tell her the truth about
what happened that day.

28:33.111 --> 28:35.447
I am <i> not</i> telling her.

28:37.849 --> 28:40.118
(door closes)

28:40.185 --> 28:42.353
{\an1}Amy, this is an
endoscopic camera,

28:42.420 --> 28:44.989
{\an5}and we are gonna use it...

28:42.420 --> 28:44.989
{\an3}I know you.

28:45.056 --> 28:48.259
{\an5}Sorry?

28:45.056 --> 28:48.259
We've met before.

28:48.326 --> 28:51.896
{\an3}It was a long time ago,
but I remember.

28:51.963 --> 28:54.499
I think you might
have me confused

28:54.566 --> 28:57.235
{\an5}with someone else.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.235
I passed out on your lawn,

28:57.302 --> 29:00.271
{\an3}and you sprayed me
with a hose.

29:00.338 --> 29:02.841
That was so mean of you.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.075
{\an1}Okay.

29:04.142 --> 29:08.046
Amy, we're gonna use this camera
to look inside your stomach

29:08.113 --> 29:11.049
to find out if your body is
brewing its own alcohol.

29:11.116 --> 29:12.383
So she's not drinking.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.986
AMY:
Well, well, well.

29:15.053 --> 29:18.990
Look who it is.
Judge Judy, everyone!

29:19.057 --> 29:20.525
She's very intoxicated.
We're going to sedate her.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.160
{\an5}Okay.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.160
Judging every...

29:22.227 --> 29:23.061
You want a piece of me?
Come on.

29:23.128 --> 29:23.962
{\an5}Let's settle this right now.

29:23.128 --> 29:23.962
Whoa, whoa.

29:24.028 --> 29:25.096
I'm so sick of this.
You think I don't

29:25.163 --> 29:27.765
{\an1}know what's going on with you?
We grew up in the same...

29:27.832 --> 29:30.235
<i>(high-pitched ringing)</i>

29:30.301 --> 29:31.903
(shouting indistinctly)

29:35.573 --> 29:36.941
There we go.
There we go.

29:37.008 --> 29:38.176
{\an5}Nothing's ever good enough.

29:37.008 --> 29:38.176
{\an1}There...

29:38.243 --> 29:39.511
Let's intubate her, please.

29:39.577 --> 29:41.179
I do not want her to choke.

29:41.246 --> 29:43.448
<i>(high-pitched ringing)</i>

29:45.049 --> 29:47.485
Uh, Dr. Tucker, you could
use the experience.

29:52.257 --> 29:53.491
I'll be right back.

29:56.261 --> 29:57.929
Hey.

29:57.996 --> 29:59.531
What the hell was that?

29:59.597 --> 30:01.833
I-I just needed some air.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.468
{\an1}You know how upset you get
when you have a patient

30:03.535 --> 30:05.136
who won't take their medicine?

30:05.203 --> 30:07.305
Therapy is your medicine.

30:07.372 --> 30:09.340
And you can either take it,

30:09.407 --> 30:11.276
or you can keep dropping
surgical instruments

30:11.342 --> 30:13.011
and passing off basic procedures

30:13.077 --> 30:14.846
and never pass your proctorship.

30:14.913 --> 30:16.581
{\an1}If Pyne thinks that
talking about that day

30:16.648 --> 30:18.316
will help you,

30:18.383 --> 30:20.451
then that is what we need to do.

30:26.591 --> 30:28.927
I'll make an appointment.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.562
Please do.

30:44.409 --> 30:45.577
How'd it go?

30:45.643 --> 30:47.312
I didn't get very far.

30:47.378 --> 30:48.913
{\an3}But you are right
to have your concerns

30:48.980 --> 30:50.114
about Dr. Griffith.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.183
So he is hiding something.

30:52.250 --> 30:55.153
{\an3}Yes. And Sam's
helping him do it.

30:55.220 --> 30:56.487
Thank you, Malcolm.

30:56.554 --> 30:58.489
{\an3}Just doing what's best
for Lakeshore.

30:58.556 --> 31:00.592
Speaking of that,
I've been doing

31:00.658 --> 31:02.527
some digging of my own.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.329
The board's reluctance
on the clinic

31:04.395 --> 31:07.365
comes down to the land you'd
have to purchase to build.

31:07.432 --> 31:09.234
They don't want to
spend the money.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.903
But you can get 'em
to budge, right?

31:11.970 --> 31:14.372
If I can get you
the land for free,

31:14.439 --> 31:15.940
I won't have to.

31:17.508 --> 31:19.544
I own a lot downtown.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.546
{\an5}It's just sitting there.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.546
Mm.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.081
And you would just
give it to me.

31:23.147 --> 31:24.182
To Lakeshore.

31:24.249 --> 31:25.650
Mm. Right.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.218
{\an1}How about I send you
the details,

31:27.285 --> 31:29.921
and if it works,
write it into the proposal,

31:29.988 --> 31:31.356
I'll take it to the board.

31:33.191 --> 31:34.292
I don't know what to say.

31:34.359 --> 31:37.195
{\an5}(chuckles)

31:34.359 --> 31:37.195
{\an3}Thank you.

31:37.262 --> 31:39.330
We make a great team.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.607
Back for more lessons?

31:49.674 --> 31:51.175
{\an1}(chuckles)

31:51.242 --> 31:52.543
{\an1}Dr. Lee gave you
the good news?

31:52.610 --> 31:54.345
We removed the entire tumor

31:54.412 --> 31:56.247
and think you'll make
a full recovery.

31:56.314 --> 31:58.216
Thank you.

31:58.283 --> 32:00.518
You have no idea
how much you've helped.

32:01.352 --> 32:04.455
Actually, I've been going
through some things lately

32:04.522 --> 32:06.057
that made me doubt myself,

32:06.124 --> 32:08.259
{\an1}but you reminded me why
I became a doctor

32:08.326 --> 32:11.195
in the first place,
so thank you.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.998
Vinit...
(speaking Hindi)

32:18.069 --> 32:20.938
{\an3}Dr. Shah, you know
my wife Meera.

32:36.754 --> 32:37.689
{\an7}For now.

32:37.755 --> 32:39.290
Not bad.

32:40.658 --> 32:43.061
Hey, I got your page.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.563
{\an1}Amy Taylor's stomach sample
came back negative for candida.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.699
She is not fermenting alcohol.

32:47.765 --> 32:49.634
{\an3}Well, at least not
in her stomach.

32:49.701 --> 32:50.601
What are you thinking?

32:50.668 --> 32:52.603
{\an3}Well, we've discarded
every other theory.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.472
{\an3}Auto-fermentation is the
strongest explanation.

32:54.539 --> 32:56.240
But we don't have
anything concrete.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.343
{\an3}We have an inebriated woman
who hasn't had a drop to drink.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.078
That's pretty concrete.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.279
Okay, what's the root cause?

33:01.346 --> 33:02.447
Why is it happening now?

33:02.513 --> 33:04.082
There are a lot of things
that could have contributed,

33:04.148 --> 33:05.983
{\an3}but...

33:06.050 --> 33:07.285
There's got to be a trigger.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.559
I'd like to order a cystoscopy
and empirically start

33:14.625 --> 33:15.693
{\an5}a course of antifungals.

33:14.625 --> 33:15.693
(elevator dings)

33:15.760 --> 33:17.061
Okay, good. Monitor her heart

33:17.128 --> 33:18.396
and keep me posted.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.367
Hey!

33:24.268 --> 33:25.036
Do me a favor.

33:25.103 --> 33:28.005
{\an3}Do not go around me
to my mother.

33:28.072 --> 33:29.707
{\an3}I answered your questions
about my dad.

33:29.774 --> 33:31.109
Did you, though?

33:31.175 --> 33:33.544
If your mom has
more questions for me,

33:33.611 --> 33:34.779
she knows where to find me.

33:37.448 --> 33:42.120
Look, it's not my mom
asking, Sam, it's me.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.222
{\an1}Look, I don't
have to tell you,

33:44.288 --> 33:46.124
if there's something wrong
with your dad,

33:46.190 --> 33:48.760
my mom's not gonna be
the last person to ask.

33:54.098 --> 33:56.234
GRIFF:
<i>Okay, now,</i>

33:56.300 --> 33:59.303
this is officially
a conflict of interest.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.406
The accident affected
all of you.

34:01.472 --> 34:03.408
Sharing your feelings
about that day

34:03.474 --> 34:04.575
may help shed some light on

34:04.642 --> 34:06.177
whatever it is
you're repressing.

34:06.244 --> 34:07.745
I'm not repressing anything.

34:07.812 --> 34:09.614
{\an4}Griff...

34:07.812 --> 34:09.614
What?!

34:09.679 --> 34:13.484
In our last session,
we talked about forgiveness.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.554
Sam, you say you've forgiven
your father for the crash.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.556
About a thousand times.

34:18.623 --> 34:22.427
{\an3}What about after the crash,
in the emergency room?

34:22.493 --> 34:24.094
Your dad's given me
his version.

34:24.161 --> 34:25.463
I'd like to hear yours.

34:26.496 --> 34:28.599
{\an3}Okay.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.601
{\an3}(sighs)

34:32.335 --> 34:34.539

VIVIAN:
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.

34:41.212 --> 34:42.713
It's going to be okay.

34:42.780 --> 34:45.116
You're gonna be okay.

{\an5}SAM:

34:52.422 --> 34:55.493
Was that traumatic for you?

34:56.527 --> 34:58.096
Uh, yeah.

34:58.162 --> 34:59.764
I mean, no, that's not...

34:59.831 --> 35:02.567
{\an5}Dad, which is it?

34:59.831 --> 35:02.567
{\an1}(scoffs)

35:02.633 --> 35:04.669
SAM: I'm tired of
trying to help you

35:04.735 --> 35:07.772
{\an3}if you will not
talk to me about this.

35:07.839 --> 35:09.707
Do you know?

35:09.774 --> 35:11.309
{\an1}Know what?

35:11.375 --> 35:14.212
{\an3}Whatever it is
he's not telling me.

35:17.515 --> 35:21.118
{\an1}The reason he didn't come
into the ER that day...

35:23.621 --> 35:26.457
...is because I wouldn't
let him.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.793
(siren wails)

35:28.860 --> 35:31.262
What happened? Is she okay?

35:31.329 --> 35:33.231
{\an5}GRIFF:
She's gonna be okay.
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.233
{\an3}Come on, let's go!
No, gotta go.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.868
{\an4}Gotta go!

35:35.299 --> 35:36.868
Hey! Not another step.

35:36.934 --> 35:39.570
{\an3}I can smell the alcohol
on your breath.

35:39.637 --> 35:40.838
You go home.

35:40.905 --> 35:43.241
{\an3}Go home before anybody
sees you like this.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.788
I was drunk.

36:02.627 --> 36:03.895
I was drunk.

36:11.402 --> 36:13.204
And you knew.

36:18.576 --> 36:19.744
Excuse me.

36:40.965 --> 36:43.601
{\an3}Good news.

36:43.668 --> 36:45.503
Amy Taylor's cystoscopy
confirmed

36:45.570 --> 36:46.604
bladder fermentation syndrome.

36:46.671 --> 36:49.340
{\an1}It was candida, just not
in the place we were looking.

36:49.407 --> 36:51.943
Great. You were right
to start the antifungals.

36:52.009 --> 36:54.812
{\an1}Alcohol levels are
dropping as we speak.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.515
What do you say we go
give her the good news?

36:58.549 --> 36:59.650
I'll pass.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.253
{\an5}You'll pass?

36:59.717 --> 37:02.253
{\an3}My, um...

37:02.320 --> 37:04.889
{\an3}My life is kind of
unraveling at the moment,

37:04.956 --> 37:06.591
so maybe you can
do it without me.

37:06.657 --> 37:08.526
{\an1}Oh, come on,
you have to be there.

37:11.629 --> 37:12.930
I'm really not in
a good headspace.

37:12.997 --> 37:14.532
All the more reason.

37:14.599 --> 37:15.866
{\an1}Look, you don't need
to be an alcoholic

37:15.933 --> 37:16.901
to benefit from this method.

37:16.968 --> 37:17.868
{\an1}You're gonna get out
of your head.

37:17.935 --> 37:20.338
{\an5}You're gonna feel better.

37:17.935 --> 37:20.338
I don't think so.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.448
You're just gonna stand there
until I go with you, aren't you?

37:30.514 --> 37:31.782
{\an1}Yep.

37:35.753 --> 37:38.990
Give the building plans over to
the city zoning commission.

37:39.991 --> 37:42.026
Can I call you back?

37:42.093 --> 37:44.462
Thank you.

37:46.564 --> 37:48.666
I know we had our differences.

37:48.733 --> 37:50.001
But I thought you were
smarter than this.

37:50.067 --> 37:52.737
This clinic is important to me.

37:52.803 --> 37:54.705
I just, I wasn't ready
to give up on it.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.307
{\an1}I'm not talking
about the clinic.

37:56.374 --> 37:57.808
I'm talking about your mother.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.844
Did you forget everything
she put us through?

37:59.910 --> 38:02.279
This is business, Dad.

38:02.346 --> 38:05.650
The land benefits Lakeshore,
and she gave it to us for free.

38:05.716 --> 38:08.786
Trust me, nothing for her
is for free.

38:08.853 --> 38:11.589
You'll pay for that land,
and I won't be able to save you.

38:11.656 --> 38:13.991
{\an3}Look, I don't need you
to save me!

38:14.058 --> 38:16.327
{\an3}Or boss me or tell me
what to think.

38:17.928 --> 38:20.598
This clinic is a big deal.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.733
I just thought you'd be
proud of me.

38:38.849 --> 38:40.484
Hey.

38:40.551 --> 38:42.920
{\an4}Nice work.

38:40.551 --> 38:42.920
{\an3}Thank you.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.089
{\an1}I heard Griff got back
into therapy.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.891
How'd that go?

38:46.957 --> 38:49.794
Uh, you'll have to ask him.

38:49.860 --> 38:52.463
Okay.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.865
Look, I'm glad that we're
able to do this.

38:54.932 --> 38:57.835
{\an1}You know, working together,
I mean.

38:57.902 --> 38:59.870
Who knew Griff
would be the thing

38:59.937 --> 39:01.439
that would get us talking
to each other?

39:01.505 --> 39:03.574
Who knew?

39:08.479 --> 39:09.714
You doing okay?

39:12.116 --> 39:13.684
No.

39:13.751 --> 39:15.052
Did something happen in therapy?

39:15.119 --> 39:18.022
You really have to ask him.

39:18.089 --> 39:21.525
But you should start getting
some sleep again soon, so...

{\an5}GRIFF:

39:37.641 --> 39:40.044
Not for me, but for Vivian.

39:43.481 --> 39:46.717
{\an3}That I was protecting
their relationship.

39:46.784 --> 39:50.955
{\an3}Took myself right out
of the picture.

39:51.021 --> 39:54.592
{\an3}What a hero.
(chuckles)

39:55.626 --> 39:57.995
And, well...

39:58.062 --> 39:59.764
I'm talking so much.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.799
{\an5}Talking's the point.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.799
{\an3}(sighs)

40:01.866 --> 40:03.801
Helps the brain process trauma.

40:03.868 --> 40:06.537
Well, how will I know when
I've processed it all?

40:06.604 --> 40:09.106
For one thing, your symptoms
will improve.

40:11.175 --> 40:12.977
(elevator dings)

40:16.180 --> 40:17.815
{\an1}Sam.

40:17.882 --> 40:20.084
{\an5}Don't.

40:17.882 --> 40:20.084
Please just let me explain.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.452
{\an5}I get it, Mom.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.452
{\an1}No.

40:21.519 --> 40:22.753
That DUI,

40:22.820 --> 40:25.189
it would have
sunk your father's career.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.792
Mired the hospital in scandal.

40:27.858 --> 40:30.094
I stopped him. I intercepted

40:30.161 --> 40:33.197
the paramedics' field report
that said he was impaired.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.199
Is this supposed to
make me feel better?

40:37.134 --> 40:38.803
You just need to know
that your father would have

40:38.869 --> 40:40.538
walked through those doors
to be with you

40:40.604 --> 40:42.706
and suffered any consequence.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.675
{\an5}But he didn't because you

40:42.773 --> 40:44.675
(elevator dings)

40:44.742 --> 40:47.044
convinced him to lie about it.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.984
How... how can I
make this right?

40:55.920 --> 40:57.588
I'm not sure you can, Mom.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.595
(door opens)

41:08.799 --> 41:10.935
It didn't work.

41:11.001 --> 41:11.936
Helping the patient.

41:12.002 --> 41:16.106
{\an1}I mean, it worked because
we helped her, but...

41:16.173 --> 41:19.510
to get me out of my head,

41:19.577 --> 41:21.745
{\an1}I think I'm gonna need
something stronger.

41:21.812 --> 41:26.617
Okay, well, I mean,
I did win the gift basket,

41:26.684 --> 41:29.086
{\an5}if you feel like...

41:26.684 --> 41:29.086
{\an1}I don't think champagne's
gonna do it either.

41:30.788 --> 41:34.158
{\an1}But I know

41:34.225 --> 41:36.694
one thing that might.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.763
At least it always used to.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.200
Worth a try.

41:43.267 --> 41:45.169
I mean, if that's what you want.

41:45.236 --> 41:48.072
I can't get emotionally
involved.

41:48.138 --> 41:50.207
I just need to stop thinking.

41:50.274 --> 41:52.276
{\an5}If that's not okay...

41:50.274 --> 41:52.276
{\an3}I have just

41:52.343 --> 41:55.145
three little words for you,
then it's okay.

41:55.212 --> 41:56.647
Three little words?

41:56.714 --> 41:58.716
Lock the door.
