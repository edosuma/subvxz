00:33.834 --> 00:37.069
- Fessy, which woman do you
wanna send down here?

00:37.138 --> 00:38.604
- Unfortunately, it's Amber B.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.606
- Y'all see the biggest snake
in the house right now.

00:40.674 --> 00:41.807
Y'all see it.

you [bleep] idiot!

00:44.845 --> 00:46.478

00:48.115 --> 00:51.016

00:55.289 --> 00:58.357
- You help me disconnect
from like the game

00:58.426 --> 01:00.592
and from like
this whole [bleep] thing.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.361

01:02.430 --> 01:04.963
<i> He has a crush</i>

01:05.032 --> 01:07.266

01:11.472 --> 01:12.771
Who would take a pizza
out and eat it.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.273
- Amber, he ate your pizza.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.008
<i> I'm honestly just trying</i>
<i> to play a little prank.</i>

01:16.077 --> 01:18.143

01:18.212 --> 01:19.845
<i> It's boring in his house,</i>

01:19.914 --> 01:22.114

Learn to appreciate your

01:56.650 --> 01:58.417
before this whole house
turns on you.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.719
And guess what, you turned
into our biggest enemy.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.355
So that's the pain of going
to every [bleep] elimination,

02:03.424 --> 02:05.424

02:05.493 --> 02:07.359

You are not here to stand up
on a couch, throwing drinks,

God, I just can't.

Don't every throw a drink

03:03.751 --> 03:05.417

I spilled a drink in your face.

Not Esther, Fessy. Fessy.

a game for a million dollars,

03:49.763 --> 03:54.800

because I need the money.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.501

Me or him?

03:56.570 --> 03:58.270
On my family--

03:58.339 --> 03:59.671
- Don't tell me
to pick somebody.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.240
I just came down here
to this whole thing.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.507
Why are you telling me

04:02.576 --> 04:03.909

I don't agree with that.

Same with you, I don't agree

04:06.113 --> 04:07.646
You guys act like [bleep]--

04:10.584 --> 04:11.750

04:11.819 --> 04:13.418
- I didn't try to.
I tried to stop it.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.387
They kept mentioning
my [bleep] name in there.

You guys don't know how to
communicate, that's not on me.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.571
I'm not gonna sit here

04:32.640 --> 04:34.139
That's not what's
gonna happen, dude.

It's not about a game show!

04:53.260 --> 04:54.793
<i> What are you all doing?</i>

04:54.862 --> 04:57.829
You're giving me an Emy,

04:57.898 --> 05:00.165
I actually feel like saying
keep fighting.

05:00.234 --> 05:01.500
Fight, fight, fight.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.135

05:03.203 --> 05:06.438
Don't do that to me, [bleep],
I'm not the one.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.706
- Why would I want you
to fight Fessy?

05:07.775 --> 05:09.374
Remember who your friends are

05:09.443 --> 05:11.009

who instigated that.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.346
<i> At the beginning of this,</i>
<i> Tori and Corey grab Josh.</i>

05:16.116 --> 05:18.383

<i> a favor and tell him,</i>

"Hey, you saw
what happened tonight?

05:20.187 --> 05:22.220
"Your eyes should be open
to who's on your side

05:22.289 --> 05:23.588
"and who's not on your side.

"And now you need to use
that information,

05:26.126 --> 05:27.726
take that to your room,
and go the [bleep] to sleep."

05:27.795 --> 05:28.960
You guys are supposed
to be coming in here,

05:29.029 --> 05:30.228
working together,

05:30.297 --> 05:32.964
and you guys are literally
fighting each other.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.335
<i> - You are a superwoman.</i>
<i> You're gorgeous.</i>

05:36.403 --> 05:37.803
You're strong.

05:37.871 --> 05:41.239
You have a mind
of a [bleep] genius.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.507
- You were the bigger person,

05:42.576 --> 05:43.942
and everybody
in this house saw it.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.677
- Yeah.
- Everybody knows.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.145
- You're good.
You've got this, baby.

05:47.214 --> 05:51.249
- Amber started this drama
and Amber finished the drama.

05:51.318 --> 05:54.052
She started it with screaming
and being aggressive,

05:54.121 --> 05:56.455
and she's finished it
with crying and like victim.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.724
<i> It's like just too much Amber,</i>

05:58.792 --> 06:00.726
and this is like
what I don't like about her.

06:00.794 --> 06:04.463
- I think I'm gonna lay down
and go to bed.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.932
- Who ate the pizza?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.134
- It wasn't supposed
to blow up the way it was,

06:09.203 --> 06:10.569
and we do feel bad,
we do feel bad, we do feel bad.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.237
- But Josh is [bleep] pissed

06:12.306 --> 06:13.972
'cause he feels like
you guys instigated it.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.607
- I don't give a [bleep].
He's a grown man.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.342
He can control his emotions.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.777
[all speaking at once]
Come on, man.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.779
It's not my problem
he's upset.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.515
Chill out, man.
It's over a pizza.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.951
He's got deeper issue
than a [bleep] pizza.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.653
- You might not have any
Challenge championships, Corey,

06:28.722 --> 06:30.822
but you definitely have
a gold medal in instigating.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.393
Congratulations, no one
can do it quite like you.

06:34.461 --> 06:35.961
- I swear on my family's life,

06:36.029 --> 06:37.929
I did not think
it was gonna turn into that.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.731
- If you thought that he wasn't
gonna [bleep] pop from that,

06:39.800 --> 06:41.233
then you must not know Josh.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.834
- I didn't think that it was
gonna turn into that.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.236
That's all I'm saying.
- Come on, Tori.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.737
She's antagonizing arguments.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.139
She's kind of sitting
in the background

06:47.207 --> 06:48.473
while things get messy,

06:48.542 --> 06:49.975
and I don't trust people
like that

06:50.043 --> 06:52.544
because if she's willing
to do that to her friends,

06:52.613 --> 06:54.012
what do you think
she's gonna do to me?

06:54.081 --> 06:57.783
- Rome wasn't built in a day,
but it crumbled in one.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.351
- I don't think
the "Big Brother" alliance

06:59.420 --> 07:00.819
is ever going to be the same,

07:00.888 --> 07:03.321
but who knows what's
gonna happen to Fessy?

07:03.390 --> 07:06.224
<i> He put his hands on Josh,</i>
<i> and he should be scared</i>

07:06.293 --> 07:09.361
because that's one thing
TJ does not put up with.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.063
<i> He could be going home.</i>

07:14.468 --> 07:16.101
<i> - It's okay, Josh.</i>
<i> It's okay.</i>

07:16.170 --> 07:17.636
You guys both have
your faults, you know?

07:17.704 --> 07:20.138
You guys both
have your thing--

07:22.042 --> 07:23.909
- I'm sorry, bro.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, bro.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.644
- Fess, please.
- I'm sorry, bro.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.113
- Please, come on.
- I'm sorry, bro.

07:28.182 --> 07:30.582
- Be cool, it's bigger
than this [bleep] game.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.884
- I'm sorry, bro.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.787
Bro, we get through this
every time, bro.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.823
- No, you [bleep] up, bro.

07:37.891 --> 07:41.827
You put hands on me,
and now it's done.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.695
You've become
one of my best friends,

07:43.764 --> 07:45.430
and you dog me for what?

07:45.499 --> 07:49.000
What do you gain from it, bro?
Nothing.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.871
And it [bleep] hurts.
It's been hurting.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.373
- Look, I'm sorry.

07:55.442 --> 07:59.711
We joke around,
and I'm sorry I put you down.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.180
It was never my intention
to make you feel like that.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.748
I'm sorry, bro.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.984
I [bleep] up.
I'm sorry.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.153
- Everyone is loving this.
You understand that?

08:08.222 --> 08:11.756
People are thriving on this
[bleep], to see you two apart.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.625
Corey and Tori [bleep]
with your minds,

08:13.694 --> 08:14.626
and you guys let it
[bleep] happen.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.328
It's crazy.

<i> Oh, my God, Berna.</i>

38:32.344 --> 38:33.943
<i> They played you, man.</i>

38:34.012 --> 38:37.013
All of these
people played you.

38:37.082 --> 38:41.751
- All right, Emy, CT,
you are now partners.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.387
That means, Hughie,
your partner abandoned you.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.789
- Again.

38:45.857 --> 38:48.591
- And, Berna, your partner
was stolen.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.694
- Right.
- Now you two are partners.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.996
Come on down.

38:53.065 --> 38:55.298
<i> - Berna is probably one of,</i>

38:55.367 --> 38:58.234
<i> if not the best, girl</i>
<i> competitor in this game,</i>

38:58.303 --> 39:00.337
<i> and that's</i>
<i> exactly what I need.</i>

39:00.405 --> 39:02.138
Me and Berna winning
the next mission

39:02.207 --> 39:04.274
is the most important thing
I can do.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.548
- Berna, you got
anything to say?

39:11.616 --> 39:13.550
- Yeah, it's the game.
That's right.

39:13.618 --> 39:17.087
And I respect every decision
because CT is a great partner.

39:17.155 --> 39:20.824
I had him before.
Just as a side note.

39:20.892 --> 39:24.761
Emy was the one
who came to me and said

39:24.830 --> 39:26.930
you're the only person
that I trust in the house,

39:26.998 --> 39:29.366
and I would never
steal your partner.

39:29.434 --> 39:32.602
And it's just funny

39:32.671 --> 39:35.372
how some other people
maybe brainwashed her

39:35.440 --> 39:37.607
because she's really
sweet and naive,

39:37.676 --> 39:40.076
but I hope she made
the right decision here

39:40.145 --> 39:42.011
because I will come
for her for sure.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.913
- Ooh.
<i> - I am shocked.</i>

39:43.982 --> 39:49.452
I feel betrayed.
I feel paralyzed.

39:49.521 --> 39:52.122
What is going on?

39:52.190 --> 39:54.691
Oh, my God.

39:57.763 --> 40:00.029
- Esther.
It's not against you.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.198
- You're not my friend, bro.
- Oh.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.767
- Okay, if you think so.

40:03.835 --> 40:06.703
- Just facts.
You don't own anyone.

40:06.772 --> 40:08.304
- I don't own anyone.

40:08.373 --> 40:11.207
I listen to your words,
I trust your words.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.143
- Back to the hallway.

40:13.211 --> 40:16.546
- I would love to,
I would love to right now.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.515
- All right everyone,
on "The Challenge"

40:18.583 --> 40:20.884
things can change
very quickly.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.453
- Berna and Hughie need to win
the next challenge.

40:23.522 --> 40:27.424
If not, they're definitely
on the chopping block,

40:27.492 --> 40:29.793
and there's only so much
I can do, Berna.

40:29.861 --> 40:31.127
So much I can do.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.896
- I'll see you
at the next mission.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.131
Get out of here.
[cheers and applause]

40:35.200 --> 40:36.866
<i> - I have no idea</i>
<i> what to expect.</i>

40:36.935 --> 40:38.134
<i> This season is definitely</i>

40:38.203 --> 40:40.036
all about adapting
to new situations.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.672
There's always going to
be new teams, new partners.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.641
<i> Things will change so quickly</i>

40:44.709 --> 40:47.143
<i> and you just have to be ready</i>
<i> and prepared for it.</i>

40:47.212 --> 40:49.279
This game is just
so unpredictable.

40:49.347 --> 40:53.249
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

40:57.189 --> 40:59.556

<i> is still going strong,</i>

40:59.624 --> 41:01.624
<i> but if I think you're</i>
<i> threatening me,</i>

41:01.693 --> 41:02.892

41:02.961 --> 41:05.495
- Whoo-hoo!
Let's go!

41:06.865 --> 41:08.498
- Are they gonna be the first
ones back with the key?

41:08.567 --> 41:10.233
- Yeah.
<i> - If Berna and Hughie win,</i>

41:10.302 --> 41:11.868
<i> everything is going</i>

41:11.937 --> 41:13.436
