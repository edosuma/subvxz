16:08.440 --> 16:10.640
And... and just all the stuff. OK?

16:10.760 --> 16:13.480
That's not fair.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.120
What's fair got to do with it?

16:40.760 --> 16:43.400
Hey there.

16:43.520 --> 16:46.880
I'm sorry. I was just
looking for somewhere a bit quiet.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.880
That's cool... It's never
that quiet when we're here.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.840
We?

16:53.000 --> 16:56.600
My mates, we like a good time.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.000
I should go find my boyfriend.

17:00.120 --> 17:04.119
OK. Boyfriend, sure...

17:09.240 --> 17:11.200
Where are you staying?

17:11.319 --> 17:15.319
In the villa over the hill.
It's a bit of a wreck.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.160
Really?

17:18.319 --> 17:22.240
Yeah, it's a bit shit.
It's been empty for a while.

17:23.480 --> 17:27.400
Tell me something I don't know,
weird girl.

17:27.760 --> 17:31.560
That's hard. You seem so wise.

17:34.280 --> 17:38.240
OK. Then I suggest
we dance our fucking dicks off.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
MUSIC GETS LOUDER

18:58.932 --> 18:59.960
{pub}Stop it.

19:45.600 --> 19:49.600
Stupid fucking men!

20:28.600 --> 20:29.720
Hey.

20:29.840 --> 20:32.080
What are you doing, Farmboy?

20:32.240 --> 20:34.880
Um... Well...
I suppose I was seeing

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
if my porn app will download
onto this iPhone that I nicked.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.160
And you have no particular
level of shame about that?

20:42.320 --> 20:46.320
Er, no, I always steal from people
who make me feel inferior.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.160
Like who?

20:48.280 --> 20:49.960
Well, pretty much anyone,

20:50.080 --> 20:53.080
er, especially if they're rich,
good looking

20:53.200 --> 20:54.560
and having a lot of sex.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.600
And that evens it out, huh?

20:55.720 --> 20:59.160
Yeah, you should try it sometime.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.760
Why don't you just try
having some sex.

21:01.880 --> 21:05.840
Yeah, don't be stupid.
Who'd want to have sex with...

21:06.000 --> 21:07.040
Whoa, hang on.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.680
If you tell a soul,
I'll fucking kill you, all right?

21:10.840 --> 21:12.400
(LAUGHS)

21:12.560 --> 21:16.440
Stop pinching yourself. You're awake
and it's time this ship set sail.

21:25.680 --> 21:29.680
I'm awake. I'm awake.
I'm awake. I'm awake.

21:29.960 --> 21:33.960
I'm awake. I'm awake.

21:34.560 --> 21:38.560
Oh, my God.
You've got to be fucking kidding.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.760
This is the only room I've ever had
where you have to wear sun block.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.240
It's heavenly.

21:56.400 --> 22:00.400
Yes, heavenly.
If I die tomorrow, then I'd go happy.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.680
What about me.
I wouldn't be happy.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.520
Oh, yeah.

22:07.640 --> 22:11.280
Well, I'd just come back
and do knob jokes to cheer you up.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.600
I'd like that.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.280
Your knob's always
been a bit of a joke.

22:15.440 --> 22:16.560
It has.

22:16.720 --> 22:20.720
But, usually,
it's ready for a bit of stand-up.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.040
Nice.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.360
Nice.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.920
Rich?

22:26.040 --> 22:27.400
My love?

22:27.520 --> 22:29.800
As long as you're here,
you may as well know...

22:29.920 --> 22:33.920
I've had a number of orgasms today
and right now I'm completely happy.

22:40.280 --> 22:44.280
Don't knock it, kid.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.520
I had to drive
your truck back, last night.

23:26.640 --> 23:30.640
Yeah, cheers. I walked.

23:31.480 --> 23:35.480
By yourself? What's going on, bro?

23:36.360 --> 23:40.360
She was so into it in Tunisia
but then after a while...

23:42.560 --> 23:45.360
I think maybe she can't do it.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.560
Do what?

23:46.680 --> 23:50.280
Be with someone.

23:50.400 --> 23:54.200
Mate, sort it out.

23:54.360 --> 23:58.080
LAUGHTER

24:07.720 --> 24:11.000
Where did you get to... last night?

24:11.120 --> 24:12.360
Nowhere.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.120
Yeah?

24:15.240 --> 24:19.240
Nothing happened.
He drove me home, that's all.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.120
Oh, the relief!

24:22.280 --> 24:26.280
You should sort things out
with Matthew.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.760
Yeah? Why?

24:28.920 --> 24:31.200
Well, because he's your boyfriend

24:31.360 --> 24:34.480
and, well, last night
you were acting like...

24:34.600 --> 24:35.960
a bit of a slut.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.440
Is that what's life's all about then?

24:38.560 --> 24:41.160
Not upsetting our boyfriends?

24:41.280 --> 24:45.280
Fuck sakes!

24:47.640 --> 24:51.560
I liked her better when she might
or might not have been a lesbian.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.080
Yep.

24:53.240 --> 24:56.280
Oh, yeah. Right on cue.

24:56.440 --> 24:58.520
Fucking hate this wanker.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.400
Yeah, I'd still shag him though.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.320
You're such a massive slut.

25:03.440 --> 25:04.560
Hi, kids.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.520
Uh, hi, older dude.

25:06.680 --> 25:07.960
Yeah, we just wanted to drop over.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.160
Yeah, friendly, y'know.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.600
Anyway, we had a kicking time
last night, right?

25:13.760 --> 25:15.840
Did he just say kicking?

25:15.960 --> 25:19.120
Yeah, yeah, Jakey's retro.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.760
Anyway, thing is,
it's a bit embarrassing

25:21.920 --> 25:24.522
but you guys have got something
that belongs to us.

25:24.642 --> 25:25.400
What?

25:27.200 --> 25:30.880
This. We thought the place
was empty and we stashed it here.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.960
Finders keepers?

25:33.080 --> 25:35.800
I'm sorry. It's just,
we owe a little cash on it.

25:35.960 --> 25:39.680
Well, take it and fuck off then.

25:40.920 --> 25:44.320
I tell you what, how about we chuck
in some eighths to say sorry?

25:44.480 --> 25:47.800
Yeah, or you could
chuck in some ounces.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.520
I mean, we do a lot of spliff.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.320
Yeah, yeah, sure, man.
And come to the beach party today.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.480
VIP list. We're sorted for E's.
What do you say?

25:55.640 --> 25:57.960
What, they've still got E's here?
Fuck, that is retro.

25:58.120 --> 25:58.840
Jake's DJ-ing.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.480
I'm fucking hot. Believe it.

26:02.600 --> 26:06.040
(BEATBOXES)

26:11.440 --> 26:13.200
(ALO) Yeah, pretty good.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.800
Not as good as this.

26:14.920 --> 26:18.680
(BEATBOXES)

26:24.760 --> 26:26.360
(BEATBOXES)

26:26.480 --> 26:30.480
Oh, my God, what wankers!

26:40.400 --> 26:44.040
DANCE MUSIC

27:06.760 --> 27:08.400
Let's get leathered!

27:08.520 --> 27:12.520
CHEERING

29:05.320 --> 29:06.480
Hey! How are you?

29:06.600 --> 29:09.760
Good. Great. Fabulous!
Come and dance with us.

29:09.880 --> 29:13.400
Ah... My friends.
They will tell tales on me.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.680
Why?

29:14.800 --> 29:16.480
I'm a God-fearing boy.

29:16.600 --> 29:19.520
Yeah, yeah, it ain't cool.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.920
LAUGHTER

29:35.200 --> 29:36.600
You're thinking...

29:36.760 --> 29:40.200
Why is life so fucking predictable?

29:42.240 --> 29:43.120
You're 17.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.920
I'm 18, actually.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.000
You're 18, you've got to
go back to school,

29:48.120 --> 29:51.400
go back to your mum and dad.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.440
Not exactly.

29:53.600 --> 29:57.600
It's all inevitable.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.720
It's all going to go down.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.560
And?

30:03.680 --> 30:07.680
You don't owe anybody anything.

30:08.480 --> 30:12.560
You owe nothing.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.240
Come with me.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.240
Where?

30:20.400 --> 30:23.880
Anywhere. Until we get bored.
Then... whatever.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.520
This...

30:30.680 --> 30:32.880
is real life.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.160
This is it.

30:35.280 --> 30:38.320
And we go right now?

30:38.480 --> 30:42.480
Right now.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.040
Whoa!

30:56.200 --> 30:59.440
Oh, uh... yeah. It's me, Farmboy.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.640
Coincidence?

31:00.760 --> 31:01.960
Unhappily. No.

31:02.080 --> 31:05.440
Er, I just came to reiterate
what will happen to you

31:05.560 --> 31:07.200
if you mention that...

31:07.360 --> 31:08.280
I banged your brains out.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.200
No, you didn't.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.120
- I fucking did.
- It's never happening again.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.600
Why not?

31:13.720 --> 31:16.440
Well, because... Because...

31:16.560 --> 31:18.680
Well, basically
you're not worthy of me. OK?

31:18.800 --> 31:22.800
Don't you like having
your brains banged out?

31:26.680 --> 31:30.520
No-one can know, Farmboy.

31:38.920 --> 31:42.920
Oh! Ah!

31:53.320 --> 31:56.120
Oi.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.960
What?

31:59.120 --> 32:03.120
Nothing. Nothing much.

32:03.880 --> 32:07.120
So...?

32:07.240 --> 32:08.560
We want a favour.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.600
We?

32:10.760 --> 32:13.520
Yeah. Yeah, Luke and me.
We'd like a favour.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.280
Why should I do anything for him?

32:15.400 --> 32:19.400
Because, er... the girl.
You've been fucking her.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.200
And now Luke's going to fuck her.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.840
Oh, piss off!

32:23.960 --> 32:24.760
Sit down.

32:24.920 --> 32:27.160
Nah. Why should I?

32:27.320 --> 32:30.160
Well, mainly because
I strapped about six kilos of dope

32:30.280 --> 32:31.800
into the bottom of your truck.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.600
Not that you'll find it.

32:33.720 --> 32:36.240
You what?!

32:36.360 --> 32:37.760
You want the girl back?

32:37.880 --> 32:40.920
S'easy. You drive your truck
into Marrakesh for us.

32:41.040 --> 32:45.040
Boom. Luke leaves her alone.
Everyone's lovely again.

32:47.440 --> 32:51.440
There's an address there.

32:52.080 --> 32:55.720
You're fucking kidding me.
It's 300km away.

32:55.840 --> 32:59.360
The roads are quiet.
No cops about at this time. Safe.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.760
What if I said fuck you?

33:01.920 --> 33:05.640
I ring them. You know, whatever it
is, www.moroccancrimestoppers.

33:05.760 --> 33:09.760
Tell them you got a load of gear
strapped into your...

33:15.320 --> 33:19.320
I think you should get going.

33:27.880 --> 33:31.400
When I am lawyer, perhaps
I will come to London and marry you.

33:31.520 --> 33:35.120
Hey. Hey.
Cut the plausible Arab malarkey.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.440
That's what I have to be careful of.
English girls.

33:44.560 --> 33:48.200
Everyone should be.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.520
You must take care too.

33:50.640 --> 33:51.920
Why?

33:52.040 --> 33:54.760
There's this guy who hides
drugs in holiday houses.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.680
Yeah? Who?

33:56.800 --> 34:00.800
You found drugs, yes?
He is bad. Very bad.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.680
English boy. His name is Luke.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.200
Very bad.

34:06.360 --> 34:10.360
You must not know him.

34:22.800 --> 34:26.800
Shit!

34:31.560 --> 34:33.360
What about my things?

34:33.520 --> 34:37.520
What about them?

34:38.199 --> 34:40.159
CAR ENGINE STARTS

34:40.279 --> 34:44.159
DRUM AND BASS MUSIC
PLAYS LOUDLY ON CAR STEREO

34:59.120 --> 35:01.400
Hey. I want to talk to you.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.200
Grace. Not now.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.480
You're not handling
the Franky thing...

35:04.600 --> 35:07.040
Leave me alone, OK! She's gone.

35:07.160 --> 35:07.920
What?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.640
Hey. Hey! Stop them!

35:09.800 --> 35:12.560
Matt, you pussy, stop them!

35:12.680 --> 35:14.280
What? Liv!

35:14.440 --> 35:18.040
Drive, for fuck's sake!
Come on, Matty!

35:18.200 --> 35:20.560
- What's going on?
- That new guy's dangerous.

35:20.720 --> 35:23.400
Do you always drive too fast?

35:23.520 --> 35:27.520
Don't pretend you don't love it.

35:29.480 --> 35:30.520
What are you doing?

35:30.640 --> 35:31.520
Come on, fucking thing!

35:31.800 --> 35:35.440
They went that way.

35:46.760 --> 35:50.760
There they are.

35:59.800 --> 36:02.000
CAR HORN

36:02.160 --> 36:04.760
Stop the car! Stop it.

36:04.880 --> 36:08.720
(LAUGHS) This is it, kid.
This is it!

36:13.480 --> 36:15.560
Just fucking stop them!

36:15.720 --> 36:17.720
For fuck's sakes, slow down!

36:17.880 --> 36:19.880
Just stop the car, please!

36:23.320 --> 36:24.160
Please slow down!

36:24.440 --> 36:26.840
For God's sake, Matty, hurry up!

36:27.400 --> 36:30.640
SCREAMING

37:34.280 --> 37:38.280
(THEY PLAY)
Four Seasons - Winter by Vivaldi

37:53.200 --> 37:55.320
Thank you, Marvellous Marimbas.

37:55.480 --> 37:58.160
I'd like to think Vivaldi
would've been stoked

37:58.280 --> 38:00.160
had he been able to hear that.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.080
Well done, the Little Glocks,
as well.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.800
APPLAUSE

38:05.960 --> 38:09.960
Right, we can have some lunch.

38:10.480 --> 38:13.400
Excuse me, kids.
Can we have some quiet, please?

38:13.560 --> 38:17.560
Yes... simmer down, look you!

38:18.640 --> 38:22.640
Thank you.

38:23.200 --> 38:27.200
I have a letter here
from the Principal, Professor Blood.

38:27.600 --> 38:31.600
I hope you'll let me read it.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.040
Dear Pupils,

38:33.200 --> 38:36.640
I want to thank you for the concern
you have shown,

38:36.760 --> 38:41.760
to my daughter Grace and to me
and my wife in the last three weeks.

38:42.200 --> 38:45.600
You will have heard
that Grace is still not well

38:45.720 --> 38:47.600
and this is going to take some time.

38:47.760 --> 38:51.760
Obviously, we are very concerned,
but I would ask that,

38:52.600 --> 38:56.480
for the present,
you do not visit the hospital.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.600
I will let you know
if the situation changes,

38:59.760 --> 39:03.680
and thanks, everyone, again
for their concern.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.640
Professor David Blood.

39:05.800 --> 39:09.800
There it is. I'm sure
we would all like to...

39:10.440 --> 39:12.680
yes...

39:12.800 --> 39:16.760
... give Gracey... a great big...

39:16.880 --> 39:20.880
... Oggy Oggy.

39:26.800 --> 39:30.720
Right, you heard the Acting
Principal. Oggy Oggy Oggy!

39:30.840 --> 39:31.720
Oi Oi Oi!

39:31.880 --> 39:34.040
Oggy! Oi!
Oggy! Oi!

39:34.200 --> 39:35.640
Oggy Oggy Oggy!

39:35.800 --> 39:39.000
Oi Oi Oi!

39:42.160 --> 39:45.560
{pub}So... you understand this,
right, Nick?

39:45.680 --> 39:47.040
Yes.

39:47.160 --> 39:50.120
If your brother contacts you,
you come and see me

39:50.280 --> 39:54.320
and I'll call the police for you,
cos I'm your Responsible Adult.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.600
Well, obviously
I have my moments, but...

39:57.760 --> 39:59.000
He hasn't called me.

39:59.120 --> 40:03.120
They found a lot of drugs
hidden in his car.

40:03.440 --> 40:07.480
Like dope, kuh-tah-mine...

40:08.040 --> 40:12.160
You know how...
people get a bit upset.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.640
It wasn't Matty's.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.160
And your brother ran away
from the accident...

40:15.320 --> 40:16.520
I know, Jose!

40:16.680 --> 40:18.240
If he rings, right...

40:18.400 --> 40:20.960
I mean - you would tell me
if he rang you, wouldn't you?

40:21.080 --> 40:24.600
To be honest, Josie,
I wouldn't fucking tell you.

40:24.760 --> 40:28.800
Right... Right. Right.

40:29.880 --> 40:33.320
You want to go for a few drinks?

40:33.440 --> 40:37.440
You're a Responsible Adult, Jose.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.840
Responsible fanny fucker!

41:14.680 --> 41:18.720
Yeah... I know, she'll be fine.

41:19.320 --> 41:22.960
Why did he run like that?

41:23.080 --> 41:27.080
The stuff in his car, I... suppose.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.760
I guess he'll explain it.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.119
I guess he...

41:33.560 --> 41:36.560
got a bit obsessed with Franky.

41:36.680 --> 41:39.040
Yeah.

41:39.200 --> 41:43.240
I... kind of wonder how that feels.

41:43.880 --> 41:47.880
Weird, I suppose.

41:49.560 --> 41:53.560

Oh...

43:42.229 --> 43:45.360
- How can I help you, Richard?
- Right... The thing is,

43:45.480 --> 43:48.280
Grace couldn't complete...

43:48.440 --> 43:52.480
... couldn't finish
her music coursework, so, erm...

43:53.600 --> 43:55.320
Grace was very talented.
Is.

43:55.480 --> 43:58.000
She is very talented.

43:58.160 --> 43:59.080
Yes, but, er...

43:59.240 --> 44:03.000
So that's why I've finished off
her music coursework for her.

44:03.120 --> 44:04.800
She's already done the vocals,

44:04.960 --> 44:06.800
er, me and my mate, we've put some...

44:06.960 --> 44:09.400
I'm sorry, it's for Grace
to pass it when she's ready.

44:09.520 --> 44:10.760
She just needs the grade.

44:10.920 --> 44:12.720
I'm sorry, Richard.

44:12.840 --> 44:16.840
Grace has to do it.

44:20.680 --> 44:22.600
This is no good.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.840

What harm can it do?

44:26.000 --> 44:27.040
That's not the point.

44:27.160 --> 44:29.800
So, what is the point?
Can you tell me that?

44:29.920 --> 44:33.920
Don't go aggro on me, Richard.
Her father says no.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.920
I have to give her something.

44:39.080 --> 44:40.480
I'll give it to her.

44:40.600 --> 44:44.600
You go home
and wait for her to ring you. OK?

44:50.000 --> 44:53.160
Here...

on his PlayStation.

45:01.400 --> 45:03.600
All right.

45:03.840 --> 45:06.320
And tell her that you're a mean old
cow who probably never gets laid.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.080
I will.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.880
I gotta say - that boyfriend
of yours is super nice.

45:19.800 --> 45:23.800
You totally lucked out,
did you not, Gracey?

45:25.800 --> 45:29.360
He says his mate helped him with it.
Whatever(!)
