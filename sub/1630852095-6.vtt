WEBVTT

00:01.041 --> 00:03.833
Are you in New York to talk to Clint?
Is that why you're here?

00:03.916 --> 00:04.958
I'm here to kill him.

00:05.041 --> 00:06.541
Someone has hired a Black Widow.

00:06.625 --> 00:09.458
-If I don't end this tonight...
-Clint, we've been so careful.

00:09.541 --> 00:11.750
Matter of time
before the big guy gets involved.

00:14.208 --> 00:16.416
Mom, I really need to talk
to you about Jack.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.208
Hey, could we change the subject?

00:18.291 --> 00:22.833
I need your help with a few decisions
on the Bishop holiday party.

00:22.916 --> 00:24.208
What if that's our deal?

00:24.291 --> 00:26.500
You get us materials for a new costume.

00:26.583 --> 00:30.166
How about enough materials to make
your costumes plus two more?

00:30.250 --> 00:33.166
I promise you
this is all a big misunderstanding.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.208
I've obviously been framed.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.500
Your boss wanted your father dead.

00:43.250 --> 00:46.833
Yes. Your boss.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.375
What is this?

00:52.416 --> 00:53.666
What are you talking about?

00:53.750 --> 00:55.000
Kate?

00:55.583 --> 00:58.291
Look at this. Who's that with my mom?

01:00.291 --> 01:03.416
Well, that's the guy
I've been worried about this whole time.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.708
Kingpin.

02:02.708 --> 02:03.875
Ms. Bishop.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.000
Mister Fisk.

02:20.125 --> 02:22.416
What can I help you with, Eleanor?

02:23.333 --> 02:26.041
We've had a good relationship,
haven't we, Wilson?

02:26.125 --> 02:27.291
Yes.

02:28.291 --> 02:31.625
I've never asked questions,
I've always done what was told.

02:31.708 --> 02:36.166
What I'd expect when there's a debt,
and your husband owed a small fortune.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.875
Which I have repaid tenfold by now.

02:38.958 --> 02:42.208
All the while doing pretty well
for yourself.

02:43.291 --> 02:46.291
Like you said,
it's been a good relationship,

02:47.291 --> 02:50.875
which is why I'm a little confused
where you're headed with this.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.166
I handled Armand like you asked.

02:56.250 --> 02:59.416
My fiancé is taking the fall for Sloan.

03:00.916 --> 03:04.291
But my daughter,
my daughter is home now,

03:05.375 --> 03:07.458
and she's getting too close.

03:08.833 --> 03:10.916
And that's where I draw the line.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.625
There are no lines in this business.

03:12.708 --> 03:15.375
And that is why
I have to leave this business.

03:15.458 --> 03:16.541
Eleanor, don't be rash.

03:16.625 --> 03:17.666
I want you to know

03:17.750 --> 03:20.166
that I have been keeping
an insurance policy.

03:20.250 --> 03:23.750
-Eleanor...
-Copies of everything, in a safe place.

03:23.833 --> 03:27.000
In the spirit of the holidays,
I'm gonna give you a minute

03:27.083 --> 03:29.208
to think about
what you're starting right now.

03:31.083 --> 03:32.833
I don't need a minute.

03:43.208 --> 03:46.125
In the spirit of the holidays,
I'm gonna give you a minute

03:46.208 --> 03:48.541
to think about
what you're starting right now.

03:50.375 --> 03:51.833
I don't need a minute.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.000
Who sent this?

03:55.666 --> 03:56.791
Yelena.

03:58.333 --> 04:02.666
Apparently my mom
is the one who hired her to kill you.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.708
Oh, wow.

04:08.791 --> 04:12.875
It doesn't make any sense. My mom
doesn't even, she doesn't even jaywalk.

04:12.958 --> 04:15.833
And now she's working with the mob?

04:15.916 --> 04:17.875
She killed Armand?

04:20.333 --> 04:21.875
My God, I need to talk to her.

04:21.958 --> 04:24.541
Kate, wait. You gotta calm down, okay?

04:24.625 --> 04:26.083
Let's talk this out.

04:26.166 --> 04:29.000
Hi, this is Eleanor.
I can't answer the phone right now...

04:29.083 --> 04:30.583
Just take a breath, okay?

04:30.666 --> 04:32.666
But your mom needs our help.

04:32.750 --> 04:36.333
That video, Kate, it's not good.

04:37.500 --> 04:41.166
The Kingpin will not take this lightly.
He is going to react,

04:41.250 --> 04:42.958
and he's gonna do it in a big way.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.416
Clint, this is my mess to clean up.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.000
You should go home,
you should be with your family.

04:48.083 --> 04:49.875
You can still make
it in time for Christmas.

04:49.958 --> 04:51.916
Kate, you're my partner.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.750
Your mess is my mess.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.875
I'm not going anywhere
until this is finished.

05:11.083 --> 05:12.791
Here she is.

05:18.583 --> 05:24.791
I've seen you at the end
of some tough matches, but this?

05:28.708 --> 05:32.541
Do you want to tell me
what's been going on?

05:39.875 --> 05:43.416
I always taught you to keep a low profile.

05:45.458 --> 05:50.958
I'm sorry. I got carried away.
You know what my father meant to me.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.541
To all of us.

05:59.291 --> 06:02.166
I've come to my senses.
I need to focus on the job.

06:02.916 --> 06:04.708
Stop chasing ghosts.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.916
That's quite the turnaround.

06:21.208 --> 06:25.708
I've realized no matter what I do,
I can't bring my father back.

06:27.750 --> 06:29.208
Finding whoever killed him,

06:30.375 --> 06:32.375
that won't change anything.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.958
He would've wanted you to move on.
He always wanted...

06:38.083 --> 06:39.916
The best for you.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.791
I only wish that he could be here now to
see you and all of your accomplishments.

06:50.916 --> 06:55.500
If it's okay with you, I'd like
a couple days off, to clear my head.

06:59.541 --> 07:01.875
Yes, that's reasonable.

07:04.875 --> 07:05.875
Maya...

07:11.916 --> 07:13.583
I love you.

07:30.166 --> 07:33.416
The Ronin is running around the city.

07:35.583 --> 07:40.916
An Avenger has taken
an outsized interest in our operations,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.125
and the Bishop woman,

07:43.208 --> 07:47.666
she thinks that she can quit her job,
as if she works for Goldman Sachs.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.875
And Maya...

07:53.208 --> 07:54.500
My Maya...

07:57.083 --> 07:58.333
She's turned on us.

08:00.125 --> 08:01.250
Yeah.

08:03.291 --> 08:05.458
What will we do about it?

08:12.333 --> 08:13.708
The people

08:15.000 --> 08:16.833
need to be reminded

08:18.583 --> 08:20.541
that the city belongs to me.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.041
Kate,

08:30.958 --> 08:32.958
I'm really sorry
how this has all turned out for you.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.041
Well...

08:35.250 --> 08:37.083
Can't think about it right now.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.041
We've gotta focus on tonight.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.083
You're right.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.500
We need a ton of gear.

08:46.583 --> 08:50.041
Like a whole batch
of way-too-dangerous trick arrows.

08:52.750 --> 08:54.333
You can make more?

09:05.333 --> 09:07.833
Hey, Kate,
have you seen that pepper spray?

09:07.916 --> 09:10.083
-Yeah, I've got it here.
-All right.

09:28.583 --> 09:29.583
What is this one?

09:31.125 --> 09:32.750
Way too dangerous.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.083
Too dangerous.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.875
So, this, uh, this holiday party tonight,

10:21.125 --> 10:22.708
is it a fancy thing?

10:23.375 --> 10:25.291
Yeah. Formal.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.000
You know, you don't have to do this.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.875
It is part of the job.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.583
It's always inconvenient.

10:41.541 --> 10:42.708
It's lonely.

10:43.708 --> 10:44.958
You will get hurt.

10:45.958 --> 10:48.833
Heroes have to make some tough decisions.

10:51.791 --> 10:53.625
So, if you're gonna do this...

10:55.541 --> 10:57.375
I just wanna know you're ready.

11:09.125 --> 11:11.708
When I was younger, aliens invaded.

11:14.583 --> 11:15.916
And I was alone.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.708
And I was terrified.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.000
But then I saw you,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.125
fighting aliens with a stick and a string.

11:31.916 --> 11:35.041
I saw you jump from that building
even though you can't fly,

11:35.916 --> 11:37.875
even though you don't have superpowers.

11:40.041 --> 11:41.375
And I thought,

11:42.083 --> 11:44.875
"If he could do that,
then I didn't have to be scared."

11:49.041 --> 11:52.500
You showed me that being a hero
isn't just for people who can fly

11:52.583 --> 11:54.083
or shoot lasers out of their hands,

11:54.166 --> 11:56.000
it's for anyone,

11:56.083 --> 12:00.125
who's brave enough to do what's right,
no matter the cost.

12:08.541 --> 12:09.625
I'm ready.

12:33.041 --> 12:34.041
I'm in position.

12:35.375 --> 12:38.250
If the Bishop woman escapes, be ready.

12:38.333 --> 12:42.125
We're on the route.
Tomas has east exits, I have west.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.666
I don't see my mom yet.

13:01.750 --> 13:04.000
Why don't you tell me
what you do see?

13:04.083 --> 13:06.416
What are our assets,
what are our threats?

13:06.541 --> 13:10.333
Mmm. Threats? That guy.

13:10.416 --> 13:14.125
That's Gary. He fired me
from one of the only jobs I ever had.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.125
Assets?

13:18.083 --> 13:19.833
Well, we have those all over the party.

13:27.708 --> 13:30.541
Chip. So good to see you.

13:30.625 --> 13:34.166
Wow. Jack's out of jail already.
Nothing phases that guy.

13:34.250 --> 13:37.125
So Jack wielding a sword,

13:37.208 --> 13:40.166
just out of jail for allegedly
murdering somebody with one.

13:40.250 --> 13:43.166
Maybe it's his way of proving
that he really is innocent?

13:43.250 --> 13:44.750
It's a weird flex, but sure.

13:45.416 --> 13:47.833
Hey, Jack. I thought you were in jail.

13:47.916 --> 13:50.500
I was, until your father bailed me out.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.708
Mom said I was gonna get
your wine collection.

13:52.791 --> 13:56.166
What? You're not old enough
to appreciate my wine collection.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.416
Well, I will be someday.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.625
The problem is
it will have peaked by then.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.708
Not if you go back to jail, it won't.

14:01.791 --> 14:04.833
Do you remember when you peed
in your pants in The Hamptons?

14:04.916 --> 14:06.791
I do. Everybody does.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.416
Take this.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.041
Stay on comms, okay?

14:22.125 --> 14:23.875
-Okay.
-I'm gonna take a lap.

14:27.583 --> 14:28.833
There you go.

14:31.541 --> 14:33.208
-Wanna check your coat?
-No, thank you.

14:33.291 --> 14:34.625
Okay, then.

14:42.916 --> 14:43.958
Do you see her?

14:44.041 --> 14:45.583
No,
I haven't seen her yet.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.000
I found her.

15:08.458 --> 15:10.916
-Kate, hi...
-Mom, come with me.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.125
What are you doing?

15:18.208 --> 15:19.541
I'm saving your life.

15:19.625 --> 15:21.708
Your business partner wants you dead.

15:21.791 --> 15:24.000
-What are you talking about?

15:26.250 --> 15:30.250
...which is why I'm a little
confused where you're headed with this.

15:30.333 --> 15:31.958
How could you do this?

15:32.041 --> 15:34.750
-I handled Armand like you asked.
-All these years.

15:35.125 --> 15:37.041
You don't understand.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.791
When your father died, I was blindsided.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.958
He owed that monster money.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.958
There you two are!
Sorry to interrupt, darling,

15:45.041 --> 15:47.125
but I really need
to have a word with you...

15:47.208 --> 15:48.666
Jack, not now.

15:48.750 --> 15:52.416
Sweetheart, Kate, don't worry about it,
I have everything under control.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.166
All clear, boss.

16:05.958 --> 16:07.875
Surprise, surprise.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.083
Get down.

16:15.291 --> 16:16.625
What the...

16:16.708 --> 16:17.875
-You okay?
-Yeah.

16:17.958 --> 16:19.458
-Get these people out of here.
-Yeah.

16:21.708 --> 16:23.791
Away from the window,
away from the window!

16:28.291 --> 16:30.000
Stay down! Stay down.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.750
This way. Missy, a little help. Come on.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.625
Barton's here, and the girl.

16:36.458 --> 16:38.916
Tell the boss Christmas came early.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.250
What the hell was that?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.083
Shots fired. We're workin' on
gettin' these people outta here.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.625
Mom and Jack, stay here.

16:44.708 --> 16:47.083
Kate, do not go out there,
it's too dangerous.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.750
You're the reason
it's dangerous out there, Mom.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.000
Just stay put and stay out of this.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.833
You know...

16:58.375 --> 17:00.416
I feel like I'm missing something here.

17:03.666 --> 17:06.916
Okay, Jack, this is it.

17:07.958 --> 17:09.500
It's your time.

17:11.958 --> 17:13.125
Come on, come on.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.625
Oh, God. Clint, who's shooting?

17:18.708 --> 17:19.916
I have no idea.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.375
-Clint.
-Hey.

17:21.458 --> 17:22.666
-Find Eleanor.
-Okay.

17:23.583 --> 17:25.791
I'm gonna head downstairs,
draw the fire away.

17:25.875 --> 17:28.375
Copy that.
We're going position two, guys.

17:28.458 --> 17:29.458
Wendy and Missy.

17:29.541 --> 17:30.541
Kill the lights.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.833
Shit.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.208
Oh, shit.

17:42.291 --> 17:44.125
So, I know you're chummy with my mom,

17:44.208 --> 17:46.666
I didn't think you'd make
the cut for the Christmas party.

17:46.750 --> 17:48.250
Kate Bishop.

17:48.916 --> 17:50.791
I'm not here to ruin anything.

17:50.875 --> 17:55.333
I'm just going to kill Barton,
have some appetizers, and then I'll go.

17:56.333 --> 17:59.833
I hope you enjoy the bruschetta,
'cause it looks like you already lost him.

17:59.916 --> 18:01.041
He's in the elevator.

18:01.125 --> 18:02.750
Yeah, what, out of 65 floors,

18:02.875 --> 18:05.375
you think you're just gonna magically
guess which one he's on?

18:05.500 --> 18:07.916
-Twelfth floor.

18:08.041 --> 18:10.208
-Damn it.
-Enjoy the party.

18:10.291 --> 18:12.625
No, no, Kate, stay.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.041
Ah.

18:28.625 --> 18:29.625
No.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.083
-What was that?
-I don't know.

18:57.791 --> 18:59.708
-No!
-No. No, no, no!

18:59.791 --> 19:01.458
Oh, my God, what is happening?

19:04.291 --> 19:06.625
-Did you plan that?
-Yes.

19:07.791 --> 19:09.416
No, no, I...

19:11.250 --> 19:12.875
No, no!

19:12.958 --> 19:15.208
Come on, that is so annoying.

19:23.666 --> 19:27.291
Yep. Please, please proceed at an orderly,
orderly manner.

19:28.291 --> 19:32.166
Orderly, or, you know, just keep yelling
and shoving each other.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.708
They're coming to you.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.625
Red One in position.

19:37.708 --> 19:41.333
Tomas will watch exits,
I will take team inside.

19:42.875 --> 19:46.333
Excuse me, come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Go, go.

19:53.375 --> 19:54.916
Kate's mom's not here.

19:55.458 --> 19:56.500
She's gone.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.000
What are we doin'?

20:21.083 --> 20:23.250
I mean, it's Christmas Eve.
Let's grab a drink, huh?

20:24.416 --> 20:26.458
-Okay. Yeah. Sure.
-Cool.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
After I kill Barton.

20:29.416 --> 20:30.958
No. No, that's not what...

20:31.041 --> 20:32.500
Come on. You don't need to...

21:01.833 --> 21:02.833
Kate, where are you?

21:02.916 --> 21:05.666
-Yep, give me a minute.
-Everyone here at 107.6 Lite FM

21:05.750 --> 21:09.041
would like to wish you
a merry Christmas Eve.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.041
That really hurts!

21:25.125 --> 21:27.416
Yeah. Yeah, well,
so did the kick to the ribs.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.708
Oh, yeah. That was a good one.

21:29.791 --> 21:33.833
That was good form.
But you did the really cool body throw.

21:33.916 --> 21:35.500
-Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
-Yeah.

21:35.583 --> 21:36.750
Stop making me like you.

21:36.833 --> 21:40.333
I'm sorry, I can't help it.
That was really fun.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Bye.

21:50.333 --> 21:52.416
-Clint!
-Was that you?

21:54.833 --> 21:56.708
It's Yelena. Watch out!

22:21.750 --> 22:25.458
It's supposed to be scary,
it's supposed to be scary. Okay.

22:40.166 --> 22:41.166
What are you doing?

22:45.875 --> 22:47.333
Kate! You okay?

22:47.750 --> 22:48.750
Yeah.

22:50.166 --> 22:52.291
Clint, the Tracksuits are here.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.208
Look! It's Kate Bishop.

23:07.541 --> 23:09.375
I know it's not
the best moment right now,

23:09.458 --> 23:11.000
but I want to thank you, you know.

23:11.083 --> 23:13.833
For your advice,
how I should speak to my girlfriend.

23:13.916 --> 23:15.750
-Did it work?
-It worked, bro,

23:15.833 --> 23:17.583
we went to Maroon 5 instead.

23:17.666 --> 23:20.166
That's so great. So, what's with the gun?

23:20.916 --> 23:23.041
I'm sorry, but... I wanted to thank you.

23:26.625 --> 23:27.750
I got you now, bro.

23:29.583 --> 23:30.875
-Jack!
-Hello, sweetie!

23:30.958 --> 23:32.000
Behind you!

23:33.708 --> 23:37.833
Jack. Jack, I am, I am so sorry
my mom got you put in jail. Are you okay?

23:37.916 --> 23:39.041
Never been better.

23:43.958 --> 23:45.916
But I'm afraid I've lost track
of your mother.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.583
Yeah. You and me, both.

24:17.458 --> 24:18.791
I'm gonna enjoy this.

24:29.791 --> 24:31.041
I told you to stop.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.916
You started all this.
And now I have to finish it.

24:40.583 --> 24:41.625
There he is.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.208
You're right, Kazi.

25:01.916 --> 25:02.958
That was fun.

25:11.875 --> 25:13.250
This is some Christmas.

25:37.708 --> 25:38.750
Hey.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.208
Clint!

25:48.500 --> 25:50.250
-Where are you?
-Right here!

25:50.750 --> 25:52.500
-Where's "here," Clint?
-In the tree.

25:52.583 --> 25:53.750
What tree?

25:53.833 --> 25:55.416
The tree!

25:56.958 --> 25:58.916
What're you doing up there?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.333
I'm just hangin' out, what do you think?

26:03.083 --> 26:04.250
Guys! Guys, where's my gear?

26:04.333 --> 26:05.541
-I need my gear.
-Missy!

26:05.625 --> 26:07.000
I got it. I got it.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.750
-Any eyes on my mom yet?
-Not yet.

26:09.291 --> 26:12.416
No? Okay. Look,
I need to get Clint out of that tree.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.666
Clear the civilians for me.

26:13.750 --> 26:15.875
What about that guy? He doesn't seem to...

26:16.125 --> 26:17.166
Take that!

26:17.250 --> 26:19.375
He's on our side,
but we should get him out, too.

26:19.458 --> 26:21.000
-All right.
-All right. Good luck.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.583
This way. This way. You just go.
Go, go. Let's do... This way.

26:27.666 --> 26:29.958
These people are terrible
at following directions.

26:30.416 --> 26:32.916
Hey, guys. I think it's time.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.291
Are you sure?

26:34.375 --> 26:37.416
Yeah. I mean, we're trained professionals,
but that's not enough now.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.416
-Let's go.
-Okay.

27:11.708 --> 27:12.791
Let's go, bro.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.500
Hey, bros.

27:30.375 --> 27:32.958
Kate, where's our backup?

27:44.250 --> 27:46.458
We're all gonna die.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.208
-You guys ready?
-Yeah.

27:50.291 --> 27:51.666
-Let's do it.
-Let's do this.

27:51.750 --> 27:56.833
This way, people! Come on, this way!
This way! This way, people.

27:56.916 --> 27:59.375
This way! That way!

27:59.458 --> 28:00.458
Come on!

28:01.750 --> 28:02.791
Yeah!

28:02.875 --> 28:05.250
Put me down! This instant!

28:05.333 --> 28:06.958
I'm trying to save your life,
you brat!

28:07.041 --> 28:08.083
Do you know who I am?

28:08.166 --> 28:10.625
Clint, I need you to hang on tight.

28:10.708 --> 28:11.916
Yeah, you think?

28:13.083 --> 28:15.416
Wait, wait. What do you mean?

28:15.500 --> 28:17.125
I'm gonna get you out of that tree.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.708
No, no, don't do anything. Kate?

28:19.791 --> 28:20.916
I'm gonna get out myself.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.500
You want me to say,
''On my signal''?

28:22.583 --> 28:24.750
Kate, please don't do anything.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.500
All right, I won't say it then.

28:26.583 --> 28:27.958
Repeat after me,

28:28.041 --> 28:30.291
''I'm not gonna do anything
incredibly stupid.''

28:34.708 --> 28:36.458
Kate, what just happened?

28:37.125 --> 28:39.333
-Kate, do not!
-Timber.

29:26.166 --> 29:27.708
We're too exposed. Let's go.

29:32.875 --> 29:33.875
My gun!

29:38.041 --> 29:39.708
That should hold them off for a bit.

29:40.291 --> 29:42.333
-Oh, my God, you wore it!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:42.416 --> 29:44.541
-Oh, my God, it looks so good, I told you.
-Yeah.

29:44.625 --> 29:47.000
Listen to me.
We need to get off this ice, okay?

29:47.083 --> 29:49.750
The only way off this ice
is up those stairs.

29:52.083 --> 29:54.708
Great. There's only about
a thousand of them and two of us.

29:55.791 --> 29:57.458
Here, take these.

29:58.750 --> 30:01.291
No way. Is it time?

30:01.791 --> 30:02.958
It's time.

30:04.375 --> 30:05.375
All right, Kate.

30:08.916 --> 30:09.958
Let's give 'em hell.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.291
- Get them!
- Run them over!

31:50.250 --> 31:51.916
-Oh, my God!
-What happened?

31:56.125 --> 31:57.500
What happens to them now?

31:57.583 --> 31:58.625
I don't know.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.833
I'll have to ask Scott about that one.

32:06.583 --> 32:07.666
Well, there's that.

32:13.375 --> 32:14.375
Let's go.

32:18.666 --> 32:20.958
Kate, your mom just came out
the side door.

32:21.041 --> 32:22.166
Copy.

32:22.583 --> 32:23.875
I gotta go find her.

32:24.541 --> 32:26.166
-You okay?
-Yeah.

32:33.833 --> 32:34.875
Just go.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.125
Nice shot!

32:46.708 --> 32:47.958
Yeah, no shit!

33:09.750 --> 33:11.666
You know what I have to do.

33:23.125 --> 33:24.208
Before I kill you,

33:26.166 --> 33:28.291
I need to ask you one question.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.500
It's nice to finally meet you,

33:32.375 --> 33:33.375
Yelena.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.416
I need to know what happened.

33:47.791 --> 33:48.875
Look, Yelena,

33:53.166 --> 33:56.416
if I told you what really happened,
you'd never believe me.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.041
But what you need to know

33:59.916 --> 34:01.833
is your sister sacrificed herself,

34:03.458 --> 34:04.833
and she saved the world.

34:06.250 --> 34:07.541
I'm sorry.

34:12.291 --> 34:13.375
You're lying.

34:13.958 --> 34:15.708
-What?
-You're pathetic.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.708
You're so pathetic.

34:34.250 --> 34:35.708
Don't you understand?

34:38.125 --> 34:40.000
This is my life, Maya.

34:42.416 --> 34:44.083
My life!

34:44.166 --> 34:46.250
It was never supposed to be yours!

34:48.708 --> 34:50.291
Don't make me do this, Maya.

34:59.416 --> 35:01.500
We have to find Kate. I think she's...

35:08.666 --> 35:10.083
Don't leave, Eleanor.

35:10.583 --> 35:12.000
Come here. Let's talk.

35:12.083 --> 35:13.333
Get away from my mom!

35:18.958 --> 35:20.416
What are you gonna do with that?

35:25.208 --> 35:26.208
What?

35:44.041 --> 35:46.250
I'm not like you.

35:47.125 --> 35:48.166
Okay?

35:49.208 --> 35:50.625
It's too late.

35:57.916 --> 35:59.416
He won't let that happen.

36:36.166 --> 36:39.375
Leave, Maya. He's coming for you.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.041
Where you goin', big guy?

36:52.750 --> 36:54.500
You're in over your head!

37:12.166 --> 37:13.208
Nobody killed her.

37:13.291 --> 37:14.333
She made a choice.

37:14.416 --> 37:15.625
Stop lying!

37:24.000 --> 37:25.250
You're not listening to me.

37:26.250 --> 37:28.708
She sacrificed herself, understand?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.333
I couldn't stop her.

37:34.291 --> 37:35.333
No.

37:51.250 --> 37:52.833
Mind your own business!

38:04.791 --> 38:07.583
Why would she sacrifice herself for you?

38:08.125 --> 38:09.791
Why do you deserve it?

38:09.875 --> 38:10.875
I don't.

38:12.125 --> 38:14.166
So she died because you let her.

38:14.791 --> 38:15.791
I fought for it.

38:16.916 --> 38:18.208
But she was better than me.

38:19.750 --> 38:21.166
You should've fought harder.

38:28.333 --> 38:29.333
Wait.

38:43.708 --> 38:46.208
You're really starting to annoy me.

39:12.166 --> 39:13.291
Mom?

39:14.083 --> 39:15.583
-Mom?
-Kate.

39:16.208 --> 39:17.333
Are you okay?

39:19.166 --> 39:20.750
I'm so sorry.

39:21.375 --> 39:23.000
I'm so sorry, baby.

39:23.666 --> 39:26.291
We're gonna put at this behind us.
You'll see.

39:26.375 --> 39:28.791
Okay? It will all go back to normal.

39:32.041 --> 39:33.750
It's never been normal, Mom.

39:35.708 --> 39:37.833
I think part of me has always known that.

39:37.916 --> 39:41.750
Honey, this was just
an unfortunate arrangement.

39:41.833 --> 39:42.916
And it's over.

39:43.666 --> 39:45.750
Killing Armand?

39:47.500 --> 39:49.666
Hiring an assassin to kill Clint?

39:49.750 --> 39:51.708
Framing your own fiancé?

39:53.083 --> 39:54.666
That's an unfortunate arrangement?

39:54.750 --> 39:55.833
Yes, sweetie.

39:55.916 --> 39:57.708
That's how the world works.

39:58.458 --> 39:59.916
I've protected you from it.

40:01.083 --> 40:04.208
You may not have known what was going on,
but I did it for you.

40:05.666 --> 40:09.333
I know what it's like to have nothing.
And you can't handle it.

40:09.916 --> 40:11.916
How do you know what I can handle?

40:12.000 --> 40:14.375
-Because I know you.

40:14.458 --> 40:18.833
And I know that you think that you can
live life without consequences,

40:18.916 --> 40:20.041
just like your father.

40:20.125 --> 40:24.208
But someone has to clean things up.
Someone has to take responsibility.

40:25.625 --> 40:27.041
-You're right.
-Mrs. Bishop.

40:27.125 --> 40:31.041
You're under arrest for
the murder of Armand Duquesne The Third.

40:31.125 --> 40:32.333
Turn around, please.

40:35.291 --> 40:37.291
Is this what heroes do?

40:38.500 --> 40:41.083
Arrest their mothers on Christmas?

40:42.125 --> 40:43.208
I'm sorry.

40:46.333 --> 40:47.375
I love you, Mom.

40:48.291 --> 40:49.291
Let's go.

41:12.750 --> 41:14.041
How do you know that?

41:20.833 --> 41:22.583
Your secret whistle with Nat.

41:24.041 --> 41:26.416
She talked about you all the time, Yelena.

41:27.083 --> 41:28.333
She did?

41:31.291 --> 41:33.041
What did she say?

41:35.083 --> 41:38.041
She told me about
how you got separated as kids.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.250
She was flying that plane.

41:46.250 --> 41:48.833
I asked her if she was scared.

41:52.333 --> 41:55.916
All she could think about
is that you were safe.

41:59.250 --> 42:02.083
That never changed, Yelena.

42:04.166 --> 42:05.333
She loved you.

42:06.833 --> 42:08.458
And always wanted you safe.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.166
You got so much time with her.

42:29.500 --> 42:30.500
Yes, I did.

42:32.750 --> 42:34.666
It shouldn't have gone this way.

42:35.833 --> 42:38.416
If I was there, I could have stopped it.
I could have...

42:38.500 --> 42:42.041
-I could have changed it.
-Nothing was gonna stop her, Yelena.

42:44.416 --> 42:45.625
You know Natasha.

42:52.833 --> 42:54.208
She made her choice.

42:58.750 --> 43:01.166
We're gonna have
to find a way to live with that.

43:05.125 --> 43:06.875
I loved her so much.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.125
Me too.

43:51.541 --> 43:52.791
I'm sorry.

44:14.041 --> 44:16.083
He's not here. He's gone.

44:37.791 --> 44:39.125
What a surprise.

44:43.958 --> 44:44.958
Maya.

44:46.916 --> 44:47.958
You and I...

44:48.541 --> 44:50.041
We're family.

44:51.375 --> 44:52.375
Family.

44:54.500 --> 44:58.375
Sometimes family
doesn't see eye to eye...

45:06.208 --> 45:07.583
Look. We didn't do any of that.

45:07.666 --> 45:09.916
We just wanna make sure
you arrest the right people.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.291
Yeah, we're the good guys.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.291
Yeah. We are with Hawkeye.

45:13.375 --> 45:15.250
-We're essentially Avengers.
-Yeah.

45:15.333 --> 45:16.375
You know,

45:17.166 --> 45:19.333
I saw you with your sword earlier.

45:20.166 --> 45:21.625
Pretty handy with that thing.

45:22.500 --> 45:24.250
Have you ever heard of LARPing?

45:26.250 --> 45:27.666
LARPing?

45:27.750 --> 45:29.666
Is that some sort of leisure activity?

45:31.833 --> 45:34.166
Well, I'm in this guild and...

45:34.250 --> 45:35.333
Balls!

45:36.333 --> 45:38.333
Think I got some blood on my tie.

45:45.958 --> 45:48.791
You know,
I gotta be really honest with you, Kate.

45:51.666 --> 45:54.416
It doesn't happen too often, but...

45:56.708 --> 45:58.333
every once in a while,

46:00.166 --> 46:01.708
you come across somebody

46:03.791 --> 46:05.708
that just makes you better...

46:08.375 --> 46:09.750
in every way.

46:12.416 --> 46:14.041
And that Missy, boy, she just...

46:15.041 --> 46:17.166
outdid herself with the suit, right?

46:17.250 --> 46:20.083
-And the elasticity in this fabric...
-Okay, you can stop.

46:25.041 --> 46:26.666
I know tonight was a lot.

46:28.333 --> 46:30.375
You took on Kingpin all by yourself.

46:32.625 --> 46:35.291
Not many people walk away
from somethin' like that.

46:37.250 --> 46:38.583
And I'm so proud of you.

46:43.500 --> 46:44.583
Thank you.

46:51.958 --> 46:55.458
You know what? We gotta walk that dog.

46:55.541 --> 46:56.916
Yeah, we do.

47:50.041 --> 47:51.125
You coming?

47:51.208 --> 47:52.958
Yeah. Come on, Lucky.

47:54.208 --> 47:56.208
Hey, are you sure this is okay?

47:57.666 --> 48:00.166
I'm telling you,
they're very excited to meet you.

48:00.250 --> 48:02.291
-Daddy!
-Hey, there he is!

48:02.375 --> 48:05.041
-Hey, buddy, Merry Christmas.
-You made it.

48:05.125 --> 48:06.250
You kept your promise.

48:06.333 --> 48:08.333
-Here, take something.
-What's your name?

48:08.416 --> 48:10.583
-Thank you. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

48:10.666 --> 48:12.791
This is Kate. Come on in. Let's go.

48:12.875 --> 48:14.041
It's cold.

48:14.916 --> 48:16.625
-You made it.
-I made it.

48:17.791 --> 48:18.791
Hey.

48:22.666 --> 48:26.250
-I missed you.
-I missed you too.

48:28.083 --> 48:30.708
Ah! The dog is so cute.
What's his name?

48:30.791 --> 48:32.708
That's Lucky.

48:33.625 --> 48:34.958
Right, yeah.

48:35.416 --> 48:36.708
Brought home a couple strays.

48:37.791 --> 48:38.875
-Hi.
-This is Kate.

48:38.958 --> 48:42.125
Welcome, Kate. So good to have you.

48:42.208 --> 48:45.666
No way! I've always wanted one of these!

48:48.750 --> 48:50.500
You're never gonna guess what was found

48:50.583 --> 48:53.250
in a black-market auction
in New York City.

48:59.333 --> 49:00.625
Thank you.

49:08.916 --> 49:10.791
I want you to take better care
of your stuff.

49:10.875 --> 49:12.791
Well, you're hardly one to talk.

49:15.791 --> 49:18.916
Kate. Hey, will you help me
with somethin' real quick?

49:19.500 --> 49:20.958
Yeah. Sure.

49:29.291 --> 49:32.958
I figured you'd like to help me end
what you started.

49:51.166 --> 49:53.291
So should I say a few words or...

49:58.958 --> 50:00.166
Can I ask you something?

50:01.333 --> 50:02.666
Yeah, sure.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.666
What do you think of "Lady Hawk"?

50:07.500 --> 50:09.291
Yeah, that's terrible.

50:11.333 --> 50:13.875
-"Hawk Eve"?
-No, that's worse.

50:13.958 --> 50:18.416
Damn, okay. Hawk Shot. Like "hot shot."
But you know, "Hawk."

50:18.500 --> 50:20.416
-No.
-"Lady Arrow"?

50:20.500 --> 50:22.500
-None of those.
-Okay, fine.

50:22.583 --> 50:24.291
You know what, actually,
I have an idea.

52:14.875 --> 52:18.208
Something strange in the air today

52:18.333 --> 52:21.583
The sun is gone and the clouds turn gray

52:21.708 --> 52:26.916
Just what's comin' is hard to say
I don't know

52:28.875 --> 52:31.666
There's a battle above the street

52:31.750 --> 52:35.541
The ground is ruined and below our feet

52:35.625 --> 52:40.375
The sky's turned red
and I feel the heat gotta go

52:42.291 --> 52:45.625
Who can save us
Our city sings

52:45.708 --> 52:49.166
We need the hope that salvation brings

52:49.250 --> 52:52.416
You have the power to find the light

52:52.500 --> 52:56.875
Avengers assemble and fight the fight

52:57.666 --> 53:00.916
Save the city and help us win

53:01.000 --> 53:04.291
Save us all from the state we're in

53:04.750 --> 53:09.666
Things look dark
But I know this can't be the end

53:11.583 --> 53:14.416
There's a future and I know that

53:14.500 --> 53:18.125
With the strength you bring us
We'll rise again

53:18.208 --> 53:23.041
Avengers unite
'Cause we've got to hear you say

53:24.000 --> 53:25.791
I could do this all

53:25.875 --> 53:28.750
Save the city and help us win

53:28.833 --> 53:32.125
Save us all from the state we're in

53:32.208 --> 53:35.333
The day looks tough
But we're New York strong

53:35.416 --> 53:38.625
And eight million people
Just can't be wrong

53:38.708 --> 53:41.666
We love all kinds
But Loki you don't belong

53:41.750 --> 53:44.125
So get gone

53:45.583 --> 53:48.416
The rent and garbage are both sky high

53:48.500 --> 53:50.333
But I love New York!

53:50.416 --> 53:52.291
Is our battle cry

53:52.375 --> 53:55.750
We're ready to fight
Never have to ask why

53:55.833 --> 53:58.041
Bring it on!

53:59.291 --> 54:02.375
Yes, the city's on the brink

54:02.458 --> 54:04.041
And it may smell

54:04.125 --> 54:06.000
But we like that stink

54:06.083 --> 54:09.583
We lived through the eighties
And this too shall pass

54:09.708 --> 54:14.791
Avengers assemble and kick some ass!

54:14.875 --> 54:17.875
Save the city and help us win

54:17.958 --> 54:21.666
Save us all from the state we're in

54:21.750 --> 54:26.416
Things look dark
But I know this can't be the end

54:28.625 --> 54:31.416
There's a future and I know that

54:31.500 --> 54:35.083
With the strength you bring us,
We'll rise again

54:35.166 --> 54:39.791
Avengers unite
'Cause we've got to hear you say

54:41.125 --> 54:44.416
I could do this all day

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
The Hulk is incredible, smashing things up

54:52.083 --> 54:55.458
While Iron Man takes to the sky

54:55.541 --> 54:57.166
Captain America's strong

54:57.291 --> 54:59.000
And that Thor is a God

54:59.083 --> 55:02.541
And Lord knows they're easy on the eyes

55:02.625 --> 55:05.791
Black Widow's a knockout
Who can knock you out

55:05.875 --> 55:09.166
And when Ant-Man flies,
You won't hear a sound

55:09.250 --> 55:11.083
While Hawkeye seems cool

55:11.166 --> 55:12.708
Like a really nice guy

55:12.791 --> 55:17.541
He just wished that New York
Wasn't their battleground

55:18.208 --> 55:20.000
I've got to get the Tesseract

55:20.083 --> 55:21.541
The battle's just begun

55:21.625 --> 55:23.000
We'll conquer the Chitauri

55:23.083 --> 55:24.958
Then get shawarma when we're done

55:25.083 --> 55:26.625
Just how are we to fight them?

55:26.708 --> 55:28.291
We'll do it as a team

55:28.375 --> 55:30.000
First Thor, unleash your lightning

55:30.083 --> 55:31.875
-Then Natasha, that's your cue
-Yes.

55:31.958 --> 55:33.333
Then Hawkeye, hit the bullseye

55:33.416 --> 55:35.375
-There's no better shot than you
-Right.

55:35.458 --> 55:37.000
Tony, you've got nukes to catch

55:37.083 --> 55:38.500
-Be careful not to crash
-Yep.

55:38.583 --> 55:40.583
And Hulk, you know the magic word is...

55:40.666 --> 55:42.333
Hulk, you know the magic word is

55:42.416 --> 55:44.125
Hulk, you know the magic word is

55:44.208 --> 55:46.750
Smash smash smash!

55:46.833 --> 55:48.916
Smash!

55:49.000 --> 55:52.000
Save the city and help us win

55:52.416 --> 55:55.458
Save us all from the state we're in

55:55.916 --> 56:00.791
Things look dark,
But I know this can't be the end

56:00.875 --> 56:02.500
It can't be the end

56:02.666 --> 56:05.875
If the city's trashed
When you take your bow

56:06.250 --> 56:09.291
We'll blame you then,
But you're good for now

56:09.625 --> 56:14.333
Avengers unite
'Cause we've got to hear you say

56:14.833 --> 56:18.625
Got to hear you
Got to hear you say

56:18.750 --> 56:20.541
I could do this all day

56:20.666 --> 56:23.083
Save the city and help us win

56:23.166 --> 56:25.625
Save us all from the state we're in

56:25.708 --> 56:28.416
I could do this all day

56:29.041 --> 56:33.583
We could do this all day!
