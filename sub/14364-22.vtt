WEBVTT

00:00.562 --> 00:03.162
<b>1x22 - Stronger, Faster</b>

00:03.337 --> 00:05.785
Hmm.
Suprisingly stable.

00:06.081 --> 00:07.029
Hey Ratchet.

00:07.237 --> 00:09.454
Is that syntetic Energon?

00:09.667 --> 00:13.957
Well, yes... in fact I'm
preparing to test the sample.

00:14.169 --> 00:17.838
I see that you'd come equipped
with protective goggles.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.273
I can watch?

00:20.410 --> 00:23.477
We just add some
to this test engine...

00:30.239 --> 00:32.463
It works! Bee!

00:33.892 --> 00:36.907
This iteration of the formula
requires further trial

00:36.909 --> 00:39.903
before we can even think
about using it for fuel,

00:39.905 --> 00:41.900
ammunition, or first aid,

00:41.902 --> 00:44.097
which is rather unfortunate,

00:44.099 --> 00:48.298
since our own energon reserves
are at an all-time low.

00:48.300 --> 00:50.296
Our severely
outnumbered warriors

00:50.298 --> 00:53.096
have been rapidly burning
through our stockpile of late

00:53.098 --> 00:56.260
as the decepticon army continues
to run us ragged

00:56.262 --> 00:58.292
and grind us down.

00:58.294 --> 01:01.924
Natural energon is in such
short supply on your planet,

01:01.926 --> 01:05.325
and Megatron seems
to have his oily claws

01:05.327 --> 01:08.658
buried deep in all the
earth's deposits.

01:08.660 --> 01:13.526
But if we can successfully
produce a synthetic form,

01:13.528 --> 01:16.925
we can manufacture
all the energy we'll ever need.

01:18.928 --> 01:20.627
More energon on the move.

01:20.629 --> 01:22.059
Again?

01:22.061 --> 01:26.694
Their recent activity
suggests a familiar pattern.

01:26.696 --> 01:29.427
The decepticons
are desperately scouting

01:29.429 --> 01:32.093
for new deposits to mine.

01:32.095 --> 01:33.360
Autobots!

01:33.362 --> 01:35.926
Optimus...

01:35.928 --> 01:38.393
If one of you comes back
wounded this time --

01:38.395 --> 01:42.026
well, our energon reserves
are nearly depleted.

01:42.028 --> 01:44.259
Understood.

01:44.261 --> 01:46.360
Activate the ground bridge.

01:46.362 --> 01:49.228
Autobots, roll out!

01:56.032 --> 02:00.200
Sometimes I wish I could do more.

03:08.103 --> 03:11.005
Ratchet?

03:11.007 --> 03:12.673
Wake up!

03:13.876 --> 03:17.844
How is it that such small beings
can be so loud?

03:17.846 --> 03:20.480
Are you hurt?
You fell.

03:20.482 --> 03:22.982
I'm fine.
I'm...

03:25.552 --> 03:27.953
...more than fine.

03:27.955 --> 03:31.990
Ah!
Energy efficiency is up 30%?

03:31.992 --> 03:34.092
Motor function's optimal?

03:37.530 --> 03:38.864
Any word from the others?

03:47.141 --> 03:50.311
Knockout, can't we
just bridge out of here?

03:50.313 --> 03:53.514
This cube's putting some
serious drag on me.

03:53.516 --> 03:56.016
The more we give
the autobots a workout,

03:56.018 --> 04:01.187
the more fuel they burn,
and we win the energon race.

04:01.189 --> 04:06.325
Besides, here comes air support.

04:48.770 --> 04:52.872
Arcee, fall back.
You're outnumbered.

04:52.874 --> 04:57.577
We're always outnumbered.
We need that energon.

04:57.579 --> 05:00.346
Ratchet, lock on to Arcee's coordinates

05:00.348 --> 05:03.250
and prepare an emergency
ground bridge.

05:03.252 --> 05:04.518
I'm locked on.

05:04.520 --> 05:08.255
Arcee, decelerate and prepare
to return to base.

05:08.257 --> 05:10.859
Save it, Ratchet.
I'm too close.

05:10.861 --> 05:12.293
Don't be a fool!

05:40.421 --> 05:42.588
She's hurt.

05:42.590 --> 05:45.090
Man the ground bridge.

06:26.167 --> 06:27.667
Ratchet?

06:43.318 --> 06:46.386
Looks like the autobots brought
in a ringer.

06:46.388 --> 06:48.754
Well, then, I'll ring his bell.

06:53.859 --> 06:56.227
It'll have to wait.

07:26.761 --> 07:28.361
What happened?

07:28.363 --> 07:30.464
I only saw the gory aftermath,

07:30.466 --> 07:33.700
but I hear that doc was
a one-bot wrecking machine.

07:35.203 --> 07:37.504
Hey, little fella.

07:39.774 --> 07:42.610
All right, what's your secret?

07:42.612 --> 07:44.278
No secret.

07:44.280 --> 07:48.515
Just a little something
I like to call synthen.

07:49.950 --> 07:51.984
From the data Bulkhead transcribed?

07:51.986 --> 07:53.719
I thought the formula was --

07:53.721 --> 07:56.555
Incomplete?
Not anymore.

07:57.858 --> 08:03.263
So, Ratchet makes a better
tough guy than I do a smart guy?

08:03.265 --> 08:05.732
Ratchet, I question the wisdom

08:05.734 --> 08:08.568
of using yourself as a test subject.

08:08.570 --> 08:11.405
Optimus, you didn't see
Ratchet out there.

08:11.407 --> 08:12.806
He was in overdrive.

08:12.808 --> 08:14.708
We should all try this stuff.

08:14.710 --> 08:17.810
Or give Ratchet more
so we can take a vacation.

08:17.812 --> 08:22.147
I agree that the initial results
seem promising,

08:22.149 --> 08:24.182
but I recommend
that further testing

08:24.184 --> 08:28.219
be confined to machines,
not autobots.

08:28.221 --> 08:31.255
Outnumbered though we may be,
old friend,

08:31.257 --> 08:35.025
we need a warrior
in the laboratory right now

08:35.028 --> 08:38.395
more than we need another
in the field.

08:40.832 --> 08:43.702
And then he came right at me.

08:43.703 --> 08:44.703
And I...

08:46.006 --> 08:48.941
Well, come on, Bulk.
Come at me.

08:48.943 --> 08:51.310
I don't want to hurt you,
Ratch.

08:53.413 --> 08:55.514
I said come at me!

09:04.790 --> 09:06.823
What was that?

09:08.794 --> 09:11.127
You have competition, Bulk.

09:11.129 --> 09:14.130
I'm a bit stronger than I used to be.

09:16.133 --> 09:19.803
Also a bit faster.

09:19.805 --> 09:22.306
Think you can take me,
muscle car?

09:25.076 --> 09:27.344
Wimp.

09:27.346 --> 09:29.146
How's it humming?

09:29.148 --> 09:30.715
Did he just...

09:30.717 --> 09:34.453
Stronger, faster, studlier.

09:39.258 --> 09:43.628
I need to be at the top
of my game.

09:43.630 --> 09:46.131
Our survival depends upon it.

09:52.672 --> 09:55.173
Looks like the 'cons hit another vein.

09:55.175 --> 09:57.274
Autobots, roll out.

09:57.276 --> 10:00.244
Hey, hey, shouldn't we wait
for our secret weapon?

10:00.246 --> 10:03.981
This mission is unlikely
to require medical expertise.

10:03.983 --> 10:06.316
But you never know
if it may require

10:06.318 --> 10:08.685
additional firepower.

10:08.687 --> 10:13.356
Bumblebee can handle
ground bridge duty.

10:16.494 --> 10:20.231
Time to put some hurt
on those decepticons!

10:50.168 --> 10:52.302
Signal's weak.

10:52.304 --> 10:53.704
They may have hit a vein,

10:53.706 --> 10:56.741
but they won't find much
of an energon pulse -- not here.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.376
I take some comfort in the fact

10:58.378 --> 11:01.213
that Megatron seems as desperate
to find the stuff as we are.

11:01.215 --> 11:04.483
Do you two always talk this much
during these missions?

11:13.660 --> 11:15.293
Autobots!

11:24.569 --> 11:27.905
It's all right.
I'm an emergency vehicle.

12:09.650 --> 12:11.351
Why the big rush?

12:11.353 --> 12:15.322
Just trying to get as far
as I can from the autobot stink.

12:15.324 --> 12:17.925
Does your boss know
you have a potty mouth?

12:17.927 --> 12:20.594
Maybe I should pay him a visit
and tell him.

12:20.596 --> 12:22.497
Get melted, wheel grinder!

12:22.499 --> 12:24.099
Melted?

12:24.101 --> 12:27.335
Now, there's a concept.

12:27.337 --> 12:30.738
I won't ask you a second time.

12:30.740 --> 12:34.508
Where is Megatron?

12:39.414 --> 12:42.782
No, no, no!

12:42.784 --> 12:47.354
That's all I know.
Really!

12:53.062 --> 12:55.696
Now, was that so difficult?

12:57.466 --> 13:01.169
Ratchet!
What are you doing?

13:01.171 --> 13:03.604
Getting results.

13:03.606 --> 13:06.741
And breaking protocol.

13:06.743 --> 13:09.510
That was a decepticon miner,

13:09.512 --> 13:12.647
servant class, not warrior class.

13:12.649 --> 13:16.851
Oh, and let me guess.
I'm just the medic.

13:16.853 --> 13:18.920
Autobots do not inflict harm

13:18.922 --> 13:21.957
unless all other options
have been exhausted.

13:21.959 --> 13:25.827
It is what separates us
from the decepticons.

13:27.197 --> 13:30.965
Is this really the time
for another lecture, Optimus?

13:30.967 --> 13:32.299
You didn't just happen

13:32.301 --> 13:34.702
to discover Megatron's
current location, did you?

13:34.704 --> 13:36.037
Well, I did!

13:36.039 --> 13:38.173
And do you happen to know
where there's a stockpile

13:38.175 --> 13:40.108
of raw energon
ripe for the taking?

13:40.110 --> 13:41.377
I do!

13:41.379 --> 13:43.479
Come on, Ratchet.
Calm it down.

13:43.481 --> 13:45.580
Calm is the last thing
we need!

13:45.582 --> 13:48.583
Calm is what lost us Cybertron!

13:48.585 --> 13:50.786
The 'cons have a warship,
an army.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.388
All this energon scouting,

13:52.390 --> 13:55.625
you think Megatron isn't
gearing up for something big?

13:55.627 --> 13:59.061
We're squandering our resources
chasing after his crumbs

13:59.063 --> 14:01.764
when we really need to be
hitting him hard

14:01.766 --> 14:03.565
and hitting him now,

14:03.567 --> 14:06.302
precisely where it hurts!

14:06.304 --> 14:08.871
A direct assault
on the decepticons

14:08.873 --> 14:10.939
would only provoke retaliation

14:10.941 --> 14:14.543
and lead to incalculable losses.

14:14.545 --> 14:18.146
I will not endanger
innocent human lives.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.783
Yet you seem to have
no problem endangering ours.

14:20.785 --> 14:22.484
Just ask Cliffjumper.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.521
Oh, I forgot.
He couldn't be here today.

14:25.523 --> 14:27.290
That's it.

14:29.961 --> 14:32.129
You know your problem,
Optimus?

14:32.131 --> 14:36.534
For such a big, strong bot,
you're soft.

14:36.536 --> 14:39.137
You didn't pound Megatron
into scrap

14:39.139 --> 14:42.774
when you had the chance --
many chances, in fact.

14:42.776 --> 14:45.710
I'm afraid that the
synthetic energon

14:45.712 --> 14:48.747
has impaired your judgment,
old friend.

14:48.749 --> 14:52.385
I am confining you to base
until further notice.

14:52.387 --> 14:55.921
Bumblebee, bridge us back.

15:03.264 --> 15:04.630
Fine.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.349
I can't get a fix
on Ratchet's coordinates.

15:42.351 --> 15:45.351
That bogus energon
must be scrambling his signal.

15:45.353 --> 15:46.853
Keep trying.

15:46.855 --> 15:52.192
We've got to find Ratchet
before he finds Megatron.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.474
Yeah, she's kind of domineering,

16:08.476 --> 16:10.043
And the extra arms are weird,

16:10.045 --> 16:13.012
but I find myself intrigued
by her.

16:18.518 --> 16:21.219
I was wondering
when you might show.

16:25.023 --> 16:29.493
You call yourself a scientist?

16:29.495 --> 16:31.661
You were supposed to
have located

16:31.663 --> 16:33.664
a fresh energon source
by now!

16:33.666 --> 16:35.399
Apologies, lord Megatron.

16:35.401 --> 16:39.070
we got a little distracted by
the new autobot who attacked us.

16:39.072 --> 16:40.404
Really?

16:40.406 --> 16:44.075
And what new autobot
would that be?

16:49.684 --> 16:51.384
Well, uh...

16:51.386 --> 16:54.787
That is your fearsome
new adversary?

16:56.524 --> 16:59.391
He's Optimus Prime's medic.

16:59.393 --> 17:05.463
Oh, no, Megatron.
I am your doctor of doom.

17:16.775 --> 17:18.742
All right, then.

17:18.744 --> 17:21.479
For Cybertro--

17:25.285 --> 17:29.421
Ratchet is rather more spirited
than I recollect.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.390
Chemical enhancement,
perhaps?

17:41.235 --> 17:45.304
There's your laboratory sample,
doctor.

17:45.306 --> 17:46.605
Find out.

17:46.607 --> 17:50.776
If a chemical can do this
for Optimus Prime's lap dog,

17:50.778 --> 17:54.814
imagine what it could
do for our troops.

17:54.816 --> 17:57.684
Optimus.

17:57.686 --> 17:59.653
I've been a fool.

18:04.393 --> 18:07.961
Optimus, Ratchet's signal.
It's back online.

18:09.563 --> 18:10.830
Bumblebee.

18:13.935 --> 18:16.904
Autobots, roll out!

18:29.417 --> 18:31.818
Doctor to doctor, I must say,

18:31.820 --> 18:34.988
your contribution
to the decepticon cause

18:34.990 --> 18:37.958
is very much appreciated.

18:37.960 --> 18:42.295
I'll be sure to boast of your
accomplishment when you're gone,

18:42.297 --> 18:46.233
which will happen in three, two...

18:48.404 --> 18:49.904
Scrap!

19:30.013 --> 19:32.413
What are you going to do,
drink it?

19:37.819 --> 19:40.054
No.

19:40.056 --> 19:42.590
I'm going to destroy it.

19:47.795 --> 19:51.031
You idiot!
Megatron will have my head!

20:20.664 --> 20:22.631
Easy, old friend.

20:22.633 --> 20:27.437
You lost a lot of energon --
good and bad.

20:27.439 --> 20:32.042
I --
I didn't intend to hurt anyone.

20:32.044 --> 20:35.445
I just wanted so badly to...

20:35.447 --> 20:36.646
Help us.

20:36.648 --> 20:38.181
We know.

20:38.183 --> 20:42.652
But you nearly caused the loss
of something irreplaceable --

20:42.654 --> 20:46.822
our medic and
a most trusted friend.

20:49.292 --> 20:53.795
You did lead us to a much
needed energon supply.

20:53.797 --> 20:58.735
And for that, we should
all be thankful.

21:01.405 --> 21:05.241
The synthetic energon formula
clearly needs refining

21:05.243 --> 21:07.677
Before it can be tested again.

21:09.747 --> 21:13.083
On machines, not autobots.

21:13.085 --> 21:15.251
Let us take comfort in the fact

21:15.253 --> 21:19.856
that you were able to dispose
of the quantity that remained.
