00:02.035 --> 00:04.304
( bell rings )

00:04.337 --> 00:07.407
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:07.440 --> 00:10.276
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:10.310 --> 00:13.213
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:13.246 --> 00:16.883
<i>* I'm at the corner</i>
<i>just in time</i>
<i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.916 --> 00:22.322
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.355 --> 00:25.492
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:28.461
<i>* And my dog ate</i>
<i>all my homework last night</i>

00:28.495 --> 00:31.364
<i>* Ridin' low on my chair</i>
<i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:31.398 --> 00:35.101
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
<i>It'll be all right</i>

00:35.135 --> 00:39.506
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:53.520 --> 00:56.656
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:56.690 --> 00:59.392
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:59.426 --> 01:02.295
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:07.233 --> 01:10.503
You may not know this,
but we're in big trouble.

01:10.537 --> 01:13.940
<i>It all began when</i>
<i>Jessie's wicked</i>
<i>stepbrother Eric</i>

01:13.973 --> 01:16.076
<i>moved to California.</i>

01:16.076 --> 01:19.412
<i>He blackmailed Slater</i>
<i>and me with some tapes.</i>

01:19.446 --> 01:21.214
<i>I bribed Lisa</i>
<i>into going out with him,</i>

01:21.247 --> 01:25.318
<i>so we could get a picture</i>
<i>of Eric driving Mrs.</i>
<i>Belding's new car.</i>

01:25.352 --> 01:28.555
<i>Unfortunate/y,</i>
<i>Eric let Lisa drive the car</i>

01:28.588 --> 01:30.457
<i>and when Screech</i>
<i>took a flash shot,</i>

01:30.490 --> 01:34.294
<i>it blinded her</i>
<i>and she crashed</i>
<i>into a brick wall.</i>

01:34.327 --> 01:37.430
Well, the bolt snapped
on the bumper...

01:37.464 --> 01:40.300
I'm estimating about 40 bucks.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.102
How much for the fender?

01:42.135 --> 01:44.604
Let me put it this way,
if you have a rich uncle,

01:44.637 --> 01:47.273
now is the time
for him to die.

01:48.375 --> 01:49.943
Great.

01:49.976 --> 01:52.212
Hey, Screech,
is the oil line leaking?

01:52.245 --> 01:54.314
Not anymore.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.387
This doesn't look good, Zack.
Between the fender,

02:00.420 --> 02:04.457
the bumper, and the hose,
we're looking
at at least $600.

02:04.491 --> 02:08.161
Maybe we could
sell Screech to Exxon.

02:08.193 --> 02:12.232
Forget it, they'd never
buy a geek that
doesn't squeak.

02:12.265 --> 02:17.070
The only way we'll get $600
is to win the lottery.

02:17.070 --> 02:20.073
Hey, Screech,
you've just given
me a great idea.

02:20.106 --> 02:22.242
Oh no, Zack, the last time
you had a great idea

02:22.275 --> 02:25.412
I wound up naked
in a jar full of jelly beans.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.649
Slater lent Eric
Mrs. Belding's new car,

02:29.683 --> 02:31.918
and then when Zack and Screech
took a picture of me driving,

02:31.951 --> 02:35.455
the flash blinded
me and I crashed,
it was so exciting.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.359
- What?
- Eric said not to worry,

02:39.392 --> 02:41.494
because Zack and Slater
would get what they deserve.

02:41.528 --> 02:44.564
Zack and Slater
have some explaining to do.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.468
Hi, sis, how you doin'?

02:48.501 --> 02:52.305
It's Ms. Sis to you,
and smile when you say that.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.343
What's bothering her?

02:56.376 --> 02:59.512
She's just having a bumpy ride
through the wonder years.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.649
Listen,
I've got front-row tickets
to the MC Hammer concert,

03:02.682 --> 03:05.251
- you wanna come?
- MC Hammer tickets.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.354
You really wanna take me?

03:07.387 --> 03:09.055
Lady, you got yourself a date.

03:09.055 --> 03:12.125
Oh great, but this time
let's take a cab.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.227
Okay, get rich quick.

03:14.260 --> 03:17.230
Buy a ticket to Bayside's
official secret math lottery.

03:17.263 --> 03:22.235
- The lucky
winner will get $600...
- All right, all right. Yeah.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.071
The winner will be announced
in Mr. Sachs' algebra class

03:25.071 --> 03:27.340
- this afternoon, so be there.
- Yeah.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.509
- All right.
- What are
the odds of winning?

03:29.542 --> 03:32.245
Ollie, this could be
your lucky day.

03:32.278 --> 03:37.117
Count me in, then I'll have
good looks and money.

03:37.150 --> 03:40.920
All right.
Okay, they're only $1,
get 'em while they're hot.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.656
- Hot, hot, hot, here we go.
- All right.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.625
Zack:
Here's the... all right.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.994
- You got a ticket? All right.
- Slater: Serious cash.

03:48.094 --> 03:50.563
- Here's serious cash.
- Check this out.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.165
- Whoa.
- Wow.

03:52.198 --> 03:54.567
Looks like we almost
have enough to fix the car.

03:54.601 --> 03:59.205
- Yeah, it's great.
- How are we
gonna pay the winner?

03:59.239 --> 04:02.042
Screech, congratulations.
You're gonna win the lottery.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.445
- Congratulations, man.
- I am? Wow!

04:05.478 --> 04:10.450
Now I can afford to buy
that Jacuzzi for
my turtle tank.

04:10.483 --> 04:13.253
- Tickets, get your tickets.
- Tickets right over here.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.622
Zack: Get a ticket.
Pass the ticket right here.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.490
You got a ticket?
Okay, you got a ticket.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.291
- Oo-ooh.
- Yes.

04:19.325 --> 04:21.060
Check this out.
You want a ticket, brother?

04:21.060 --> 04:24.664
And how many do you want?
Whoops.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.367
Exactly what
are you doing, Slater?

04:27.400 --> 04:29.669
Protecting
your reputation, Mama.

04:29.703 --> 04:34.174
Do you want the whole school
to hear you call
me your Curly Conan?

04:34.207 --> 04:36.609
Shh! Slater, I thought
you took care of that.

04:36.643 --> 04:39.979
Hey, I did.
Just not well.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.581
What's your story, Zack?

04:41.614 --> 04:44.417
Eric's threatening
to tell Belding
I'm not Jewish.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.319
- You're not Jewish, Zack.
- I know that,

04:46.353 --> 04:48.488
but I converted
for the Dodger game.

04:48.521 --> 04:51.591
Was wrecking Belding's car
part of your
religious experience?

04:51.624 --> 04:54.661
Don't worry,
we're running a lottery
to buy new parts,

04:54.694 --> 04:56.563
then Slater's gonna
fix the car in the auto shop.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.632
It's cool, Belding won't
be back for two days.

04:59.666 --> 05:02.402
Shoo-ba-do-bop-bop,
whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa.

05:02.435 --> 05:05.105
Hey, gang,
guess who's back early?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.173
Relax, it's cool.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.611
Mr. Belding,
what are you doing here?

05:11.644 --> 05:14.547
The conference was a bore
and I missed my wife.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.216
- Oh.
- Surprised?

05:16.249 --> 05:18.318
Surprised
doesn't cover it, sir.

05:18.351 --> 05:20.487
Shocked is more like it.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.956
- Good luck, boys.
- Hey, Jess...

05:23.056 --> 05:26.426
So, Slater, where's the car?
I can't wait to
play this new CD.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.595
Hey, what you got there?
Let me see.

05:28.628 --> 05:31.498
- "Bo Jackson
Sings the Blues."
- Oo-ooh.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.700
- That's one of my
favorites too, sir.
- Yeah.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.302
Hey, Bo knows blues.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.072
Let's go to the car and we'll
listen to it on
my new CD player.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.741
No, no, no, sir, sir.
Now is not a good time.

05:41.775 --> 05:45.178
- Why not?
- You see,
it's not ready, sir.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.547
We weren't expecting you
until tomorrow.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.083
Is something wrong, Slater?

05:50.116 --> 05:54.087
Actually, sir, there are just
a few little pieces missing.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.321
Yeah, yeah.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.158
You see, sir, the car...
the car is Japanese

05:58.191 --> 06:01.294
and the CD player...
it's German,

06:01.327 --> 06:04.130
- Zack: when you...
- In plain English,
what he's saying,

06:04.164 --> 06:05.665
in order
to make them compatible

06:05.699 --> 06:09.336
we had to order
a <i>"Gaheinadorfenflagen."</i>

06:09.369 --> 06:12.038
Yeah, that's right!
To hook up with the...

06:12.072 --> 06:14.140
with the <i>"Yamasushi...</i>

06:14.174 --> 06:17.043
<i>Yakatori...</i>

06:17.043 --> 06:18.945
Both: <i>Speakaleaker. "</i>

06:19.045 --> 06:21.681
But don't worry
about that, sir.
That way we'll avoid static

06:21.715 --> 06:23.950
in the <i>"Dinglehoffen-Farben."</i>

06:24.050 --> 06:27.053
- It sounds complicated.
- The hardest
part is saying it,

06:27.087 --> 06:29.122
- right, Slater?
- Oh, right. Don't worry, sir.

06:29.155 --> 06:32.659
We'll have it ready before
you can say <i>"fahrvergnugen."</i>

06:32.692 --> 06:35.362
"Farfeg-noo-gen..."

06:41.601 --> 06:44.671
Okay, quiet down. Here's how
we're gonna pick the winner,

06:44.704 --> 06:48.742
Mr. Sachs will pull an algebra
question from the box as
he does every week.

06:48.775 --> 06:51.644
The person with
the last five
numbers of the answer

06:51.678 --> 06:53.847
will win $600.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.952
- Good morning, class.
- All right.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.524
Wait a minute,
there's gotta be
some sort of mistake.

07:04.557 --> 07:06.459
I know most of you
don't belong in this class.

07:06.493 --> 07:09.029
Sir, your fame is spreading.
Everybody wants to be

07:09.029 --> 07:12.632
a part of your incredible
"stump the teacher" exercise.

07:12.665 --> 07:15.702
Well, that's very flattering,
class,

07:15.735 --> 07:19.739
- shall we get on with it?
- Hey, yeah! Come on.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.943
- They love algebra, sir.
- Let's see who
can stump me today.

07:29.582 --> 07:33.053
Bet you don't know how
we're gonna pull this one off.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.723
( bell ringing )

07:36.756 --> 07:39.559
Fire drill, fire drill.
Remain calm.

07:39.592 --> 07:43.296
Everybody vacate this room.
This door only. Remain calm.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.339
Heh heh heh.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.546
Ready?

08:02.015 --> 08:05.018
- A equals five...
- ( class cheering )

08:06.720 --> 08:09.522
Thank you.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.858
- Nine...
- ( class cheering )

08:13.526 --> 08:17.364
I've never seen
such math enthusiasm.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.367
- Four...
- ( class cheering )

08:20.400 --> 08:21.768
This is unbelievable.

08:21.801 --> 08:24.070
It's algebra fever, sir.
Go on, we can't wait.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.040
Oh, all right.
Let's see, seven...

08:27.073 --> 08:28.842
- ( scattered cheers )
- Seven, yes.

08:28.875 --> 08:32.846
Seven, rats, I guess
I'm still just
another pretty face.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.049
The last number is... two.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.053
I won!

08:40.053 --> 08:41.154
- I won!
- What?

08:41.187 --> 08:45.058
- He means
you're wonderful, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

08:45.058 --> 08:48.495
I like you too, Screech.
Thank you very much.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.332
We need the money
to fix Belding's car.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.068
But I've never won
anything like this before.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.337
The closest I ever came
was winning third place

08:57.370 --> 09:00.106
at the Wile E. Coyote
look-alike contest.

09:01.708 --> 09:06.012
Screech,
just give me the money
or I'm gonna flush you home.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.517
All right, see?

09:10.550 --> 09:12.519
Well, well,
isn't this interesting?

09:12.552 --> 09:16.923
- What are you doing here?
- It's a bathroom,
take a guess.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.059
The way I see it,
every kid in this school

09:19.092 --> 09:21.795
might be interested in knowing
that you rigged the lottery.

09:21.828 --> 09:25.031
- Yeah, so, what's your point?
- I could forget
about the whole thing,

09:25.031 --> 09:28.935
if this time you lent me
your car to drive my girl
to the concert.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.538
Listen,
she's not your girl, punk.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.940
The only reason Lisa went out
with you is
because I bribed her.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.042
- Get out of here,
she likes me.
- Oh, yeah?

09:36.042 --> 09:39.412
Ask her where she got
front-row tickets to
the MC Hammer concert.

09:39.446 --> 09:42.649
- He's kidding,
isn't he, Slater?
- Nope.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.821
Hi, Eric, sit down.

09:47.854 --> 09:50.557
- I don't know if I'm staying.
- Good.

09:50.590 --> 09:54.828
Lisa, where'd you get
the MC Hammer tickets?

09:54.861 --> 09:56.830
- Why?
- They're so hard to get,

09:56.863 --> 09:59.632
I just wondered
how you got them.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.068
I got them from Zack.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.804
You mean you bought
them from Zack.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.741
Not exactly.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.610
What does that mean?

10:10.643 --> 10:12.712
Well, he...
he gave them to me.

10:12.746 --> 10:16.516
You mean he
bribed you with them
to go on a date with me.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.554
- It's not what you think.
- Is it true? Yes or no?

10:22.989 --> 10:24.858
Yes,
but you don't understand...

10:24.891 --> 10:26.693
I understand all right.

10:26.726 --> 10:30.697
When you told me you liked me
that was a lie too.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.433
Lisa, I never want
to see you again.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.570
Eric, wait, listen to me.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.447
Is this true, Lisa?

10:49.783 --> 10:52.118
( sobbing ) Yes.

10:52.152 --> 10:56.089
But when I took the tickets
l didn't like him.

10:56.122 --> 10:58.892
And now I don't like me.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.770
All right,
you future mechanics...

11:10.804 --> 11:13.740
today we're gonna get down
and get dirty.

11:13.773 --> 11:16.543
I love getting dirty,
it's macho.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.647
Usually we don't get a car
till the end of the year,

11:20.680 --> 11:23.883
but we takes what we can get
when we gets it.

11:23.917 --> 11:27.087
Mr. Screech,
please undress the car.

11:27.087 --> 11:30.557
I'd rather not, we haven't
been formally introduced.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.492
Oh, excuse me.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.462
Mr. Powers, this is the car.

11:35.495 --> 11:39.099
Car, Mr. Powers.
Now you're
properly introduced.

11:39.099 --> 11:42.135
- Strip it.
- I can't, we've just met.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.906
- I'll do it.
- All right, thanks, Eric.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.978
Whoa.
Looks like Mr. El Cheapo Beldo

11:52.012 --> 11:55.115
went and got us
a great junker.

11:55.115 --> 11:58.585
This baby's only got about...

11:58.618 --> 12:00.220
$500 worth of damage on it.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.956
It's $610.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.693
- And how do you know that?
- Just a shot in the dark.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.063
Okay. Pop the hood,
let's take apart
the carburetor.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.066
Mr. Sonski, in New York
we took apart the whole car.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.134
Did the owners know?

12:14.167 --> 12:17.904
Or was it a surprise
when they left the restaurant?

12:17.937 --> 12:19.639
That's a joke, kid.

12:19.673 --> 12:22.442
I think we could learn more
if we took
apart the whole car.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.678
Aw, don't do that.
Please don't do that.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.146
Why not?

12:26.179 --> 12:29.516
'Cause it hasn't done
anything to you.

12:29.549 --> 12:32.085
You know, Screech,
you could drive
a crazy man nuts.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.521
Now get to work, men
and ladies.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.990
You'll have
to go through me first.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.998
By tomorrow this baby
will be as good as new.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.267
Better than new, Preppie.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.236
- I don't think so.
- Oh, man.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.906
How did this happen?

12:52.939 --> 12:55.008
( moaning )

12:59.579 --> 13:00.947
What's that noise?

13:01.047 --> 13:04.884
( moaning continues )

13:04.918 --> 13:08.221
- It's coming from under here.
- Hey.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.590
- Both: Hey, Screech.
- What are you doing in there?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.659
Well, there's not room
to do much.

13:12.692 --> 13:15.061
- Who did this, Screech?
- Jessie's sweet
little brother.

13:15.061 --> 13:19.065
- Oh, man.
- We are in big trouble.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.969
So am I, I've had to go
to the bathroom for two hours.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.939
Slater, do you think
you can fix this?

13:25.972 --> 13:28.942
I don't know, Preppie,
I've never put a whole car
together before.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.112
You should have been here
when we took it apart.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.948
Wait a minute,
you helped take it apart?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.083
- You...
- Wha...

13:38.518 --> 13:41.621
Guys, honest,
I tried to stop them.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.624
Guys?
It's dark in here.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.626
Guys?

13:50.697 --> 13:52.599
( knocking on door )

13:53.667 --> 13:55.602
Can I come in?

13:55.635 --> 13:57.203
You're already in.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.172
I really wanna talk to you.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.174
It's a free country, talk.

14:01.207 --> 14:04.511
- Lisa is really upset.
- So am I.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.684
For some strange reason
she really likes you.

14:10.717 --> 14:15.055
She likes me so much that she
helped Slater
and Zack set me up.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.857
She had nothing to do
with that, besides...

14:17.891 --> 14:21.261
- you started the whole thing.
- And I finished it too.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.862
What are you talking about?

14:22.896 --> 14:24.898
I had the shop class
take apart Belding's car.

14:24.931 --> 14:29.736
That Mr.
Sonski's a pretty cool guy,
he even gave me an A.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.205
- You did what?
- They'll never
get it back together

14:32.238 --> 14:35.175
by tomorrow. And that'll
teach them to mess with me.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.078
They could be expelled.
Don't you care
about who you hurt?

14:38.078 --> 14:41.247
Nope,
just as long as it's not me.

14:44.818 --> 14:49.155
You are a selfish,
inconsiderate
excuse for a human being.

14:49.189 --> 14:53.593
- If I was a guy,
I'd punch you out.
- Too bad you're just a chick.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.164
Just a chick?

14:58.198 --> 15:01.034
Just a chick?

15:01.067 --> 15:03.203
- I can't believe
you just did that.
- You want more?

15:03.236 --> 15:06.673
I was excited
about you coming here.
I never had a brother,

15:06.706 --> 15:10.610
and I thought we could
have fun, be close and do
things together.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.912
I tried to make us
like a real family,

15:12.946 --> 15:15.148
but you wouldn't even
give it a chance.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.883
And you know what?

15:16.916 --> 15:19.652
I don't want
a brother anymore.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.292
Look, guys, I'm sorry,
it's no use, okay?

15:26.326 --> 15:29.596
- I can't put
the car back together.
- But we were counting on you.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.132
You're our only hope.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.067
I don't need this pressure.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.170
I'm the captain of
the wrestling team
and the football team.

15:37.203 --> 15:40.573
I've got great dimples,
good teeth, and the biggest
muscles in school.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.076
Isn't that enough
for my friends? What's up?

15:43.076 --> 15:46.279
- I'm sorry,
Slater, just chill out.
- Shh.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.318
Maybe if we play
the CD real loud
Mr. Belding won't notice that

15:52.352 --> 15:56.923
the windshield,
the drive shaft,
and the doors are missing.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.759
I'm just trying to lighten
the emotional load here.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.362
There's a better
way to do that.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.899
Oh yeah, sure,
beat on the little guy.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.734
Blame the geek.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.904
It wasn't even my fault,
Eric started it.

16:10.937 --> 16:14.874
Oh, not really, Screech.
I started it by
cutting school.

16:14.908 --> 16:17.944
I could have stopped it,
but beating Eric
was more important to me.

16:18.044 --> 16:21.715
And I should have let Jessie
work out her own problems
with her brother.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.049
And I shouldn't have
drunk all that water

16:23.049 --> 16:25.352
before he put me in the tires.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.323
Well, guys,
what are we gonna do?

16:30.357 --> 16:34.227
We've gotta take the heat.
There's nothing left
but tell the truth.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.062
- Tell him, Zack.
- I guess you
didn't hear about

16:36.062 --> 16:38.932
the hurricane that hit
Los Angeles last night.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.334
Yeah, it landed right on top
of the auto shop.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.670
Your car, sir,
is in 1,000 pieces,

16:43.703 --> 16:46.606
- but we found them all.
- Yeah.

16:46.639 --> 16:51.077
- You guys are such kidders.
- Wait till you see the car.

16:51.077 --> 16:54.681
- So how's the CD player?
- Oh, it's in, sir.

16:54.714 --> 16:58.818
- Is it easy to get to?
- Yes, especially if
the door's missing.

16:58.852 --> 17:02.856
You're just trying
to make me nervous.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.025
Mr. Belding, we really
have to tell you something.

17:05.025 --> 17:08.294
Tell me later.
I can't wait.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.262
Unison: We can.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.568
Well, this is a surprise.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.171
Oh boy, we're dead.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.874
Don't be too hard on us, sir.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.575
Wow!

17:26.346 --> 17:29.215
You did a great job, Slater.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.251
- I did?
- Yeah!

17:31.284 --> 17:33.887
- Yeah, I did.
- PA system: <i>Mr. Belding,</i>

17:33.920 --> 17:36.756
<i>there's an emergency</i>
<i>in the cafeteria.</i>

17:36.790 --> 17:41.161
<i>There's either</i>
<i>mice on the loose,</i>
<i>or the meatloaf has legs.</i>

17:41.194 --> 17:44.831
I'll play these CDs later.
Thanks, boys.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.201
Zack:
Wait a minute.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.970
If I didn't fix it
and you didn't fix it,

17:51.071 --> 17:52.872
then who did?

17:52.906 --> 17:54.674
I did.

17:54.708 --> 17:58.078
- You? Why?
- I like
putting cars together.

17:58.078 --> 18:01.014
- You didn't have to do this.
- I know.

18:01.014 --> 18:03.116
Where'd you get
that black eye?

18:03.149 --> 18:05.618
You've got
a tough girlfriend, Slater.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.920
Jessie hit you?

18:07.020 --> 18:10.023
Yeah, whatever you do,
don't call her a chick.

18:10.056 --> 18:13.159
I could have told you that.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.028
Look, guys,
I don't fit in around here,

18:15.061 --> 18:17.364
so I'm moving back
to New York.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.265
- You're kidding?
- Would I lie?

18:19.299 --> 18:22.369
- Both: Would you lie...
- Slater: ...come on.

18:26.239 --> 18:29.175
- These are for you.
- Our tapes.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.044
I thought you said
you had 20 of these?

18:31.077 --> 18:32.879
So I lied.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.782
<i>Shalom,</i> Zack.
See you, Curly Conan.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.084
Don't say that out loud.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.086
Take care of my sister.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.721
You got it.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.860
- ( knocking on door )
- Come in.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.399
I heard
you fixed Belding's car.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.401
Who squealed?

18:54.434 --> 18:58.071
- What are you doing?
- Giving you your room back.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.006
I'm going to New York
to live with my aunt.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.742
She doesn't have
a good right cross.

19:02.776 --> 19:06.179
- I'm sorry I hit you.
- Me too, it hurt.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.351
Now that I'm leaving it should
make all your friends happy.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.020
Don't be so sure about that.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.892
- Guys.
- Hey, hon.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.294
- Zack: How you doing?
- Slater: What's up, Eric?

19:21.327 --> 19:23.129
You can all beat me up now?

19:23.163 --> 19:27.033
No, Eric, I called New York
and they don't want you back.

19:27.067 --> 19:28.368
I think you should stay.

19:28.401 --> 19:32.939
All you California guys
talk like you've been in
the sun too long.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.407
Why do you want me to stay?

19:34.441 --> 19:37.210
Well, 'cause you
make it interesting.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.645
You keep me on my toes.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.114
I know you don't have
any friends out here,

19:41.147 --> 19:45.051
I could introduce you
to some pretty cool guys.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.420
Do you play chess?

19:49.155 --> 19:50.724
What about you?

19:50.757 --> 19:52.192
Me?

19:54.227 --> 19:59.165
The truth is,
that if Zack hadn't bribed me,

19:59.199 --> 20:02.736
I would have never
gone out with you.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.772
But I'm glad I did,

20:05.805 --> 20:09.242
because I really got a chance
to get to know you.

20:13.346 --> 20:16.316
Eric, please don't go.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.818
I'd really miss you.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.097
( crying )
That was beautiful.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.735
- It's okay, Screech.
It's okay.
- ( sniffs )

20:37.837 --> 20:39.973
Thanks, guys.
Give me a minute
alone with Eric.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.741
All right.

20:43.209 --> 20:46.012
Look, Eric,

20:46.046 --> 20:48.481
when our parents
got married,

20:48.515 --> 20:51.351
I thought we'd all just
magically love each other.

20:51.384 --> 20:54.120
What, like "The Brady Bunch"?

20:54.154 --> 20:55.789
Yeah.

20:56.890 --> 20:58.925
But you had
to leave everything,

20:58.958 --> 21:02.462
your house, your friends,
your school.

21:02.495 --> 21:05.765
I don't know what would happen
if I had to move to New York.

21:05.799 --> 21:10.170
Every mugger would leave town.
They'd be afraid
of your right cross.

21:11.171 --> 21:13.206
What I'm saying is,

21:13.239 --> 21:15.475
would you give it
another chance?

21:15.508 --> 21:17.410
You really mean it?

21:17.444 --> 21:18.878
I do.

21:18.912 --> 21:21.314
You know,
I never wanted a sister,

21:21.348 --> 21:23.950
but it might not be so bad.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.519
Okay.

21:26.553 --> 21:29.189
I'll hang around for a while.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.826
How about
a hug for your sister?

21:39.099 --> 21:41.134
Now get out of my room.
