00:13.947 --> 00:15.416

00:15.449 --> 00:18.319
Damn, man.
It's hot as hell in there.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.020
Don't be breaks, man.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.691
You know, we could, um--

00:23.724 --> 00:25.426
we could do some
instrumental shit,

00:25.459 --> 00:27.161
you know,
like a Kendrick album.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.397
I know the recorder
a little bit, so, like,

00:29.430 --> 00:31.432
we could do a song
like "Pussy Relevance."

00:31.465 --> 00:33.767
You can come in like...
* Pussy relevance

00:33.801 --> 00:35.936
-both: * So intelligent
-And then I can come in like...

00:35.969 --> 00:37.271
* Do, do-do-do,
do, do *

00:37.305 --> 00:39.407
* Do-do-do-do-do,
do, do, do *

00:39.440 --> 00:41.109
* Do-do-do, do, do

00:41.142 --> 00:42.610
And you can be like,
"Bye, everybody,"

00:42.643 --> 00:44.212
-Like, "I'm gonna take a break."
-(coughing)

00:44.245 --> 00:46.180
(laughter)

00:46.214 --> 00:49.117

00:52.153 --> 00:54.722
'Sup, guys?
I'm Zan.

Hey!
Paper Boi.

Good shit, homey.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.430
Yeah,

01:02.463 --> 01:06.066
But I'm still your nigga,
believe me.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.201
Shit,
are you even black?

01:07.235 --> 01:08.336
Of course I am.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.739
You want a hat, Paper Boi?

01:13.241 --> 01:14.408
Nah, we're--
we're good, man.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.476
All right.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.178
Peep this.
(phone clicks)

01:22.015 --> 01:24.318
Is that a meme
depicting what happens to you

01:24.352 --> 01:26.254
or to bae when
they scroll through the DMs?

01:26.287 --> 01:28.055
(tsks)
Man, whatever.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.491
I got those likes.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.493
Guess who saw someone
throw up on the booth?

01:32.526 --> 01:33.761
Hey!

01:33.794 --> 01:35.496
Back the fuck off
Paper Boi, man!

01:35.529 --> 01:36.997
-The fuck, man?
-Whoa.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.499
Oh.
My bad.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.833
Is this your boy?

01:39.867 --> 01:41.602
'Sup, man?
I'm Zan.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.171
You want a hat?

01:44.372 --> 01:45.673
Nigga.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.441
-Yeah.
-Right on.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.009
Let me get one

01:56.049 --> 01:57.418
Oh, yeah.
(camera shutter clicking)

01:57.451 --> 01:59.153
And one more for Snapchat.

01:59.187 --> 02:01.155
All right, man.
That's enough.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.324
What?
Are you sure?

02:03.357 --> 02:04.758
I'm a photographer, man.

02:04.792 --> 02:05.859
I took this.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.762
Oh, it's your face

02:08.796 --> 02:10.298
Wait, I forget.
What's your email?

02:10.331 --> 02:12.132
I never gave it to you.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.202
It's cool, just...
just take my phone number, man.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.669
Yeah, yeah,
I'll text you mine.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.971
Maybe we can collab
on a song or shirt.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.007
Or sneakies.
Yo!

02:20.040 --> 02:23.143
Me and my mans make
baby sneakers for adults.

02:23.177 --> 02:25.346

Mm. Mm.

Breakfast cup.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.102
You made that up.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.538
Everything's made up,
nigga, stay woke.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.939
Hey, man.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.609
That dude from last night
talking shit.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.077
What?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.251
"Paper Boi,
who getting

03:37.285 --> 03:38.952
"a lot of hype in the streets
for a possible

03:38.986 --> 03:40.954
"involvement with a murder,
is, how you say,

03:40.988 --> 03:43.424
not as talented
as people think."

03:44.958 --> 03:47.295
That's a weird...
sentence.

03:49.297 --> 03:52.099
(keys clacking rapidly)

03:52.132 --> 03:53.567
Right, uh,
you ready to go?

03:53.601 --> 03:55.969
-Yeah.
-Oh, also,

03:56.003 --> 03:57.638
is it okay if I spend
the night over here again?

04:06.414 --> 04:08.916
-(keys clacking)
-Yep.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.452
Yeah, man.
Don't bait this dude.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.553
You'll just make it worse.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.456
(keys clacking)

04:17.858 --> 04:18.959
Hey!
(light thud)

04:18.992 --> 04:20.461
You're gonna make it worse!

04:22.830 --> 04:25.333
(keys clacking)

04:32.673 --> 04:34.675
AIDS was invented to keep

04:34.708 --> 04:37.010
Wilt Chamberlain from beating
Steve McQueen's sex record.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.014
You know, by '69,
he was already

04:41.048 --> 04:43.183
number three
on the all-time list.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.420
By '71, he would have
beat that boy for sure.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.956
I thought AIDS was made by the
government to kill homosexuals.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.525
Oh, yeah, that too,
I mean, but...

04:52.826 --> 04:54.027
Two for one.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.863
Mm-hmm.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.965
Who's Steve McQueen?

04:57.998 --> 04:59.132
(scoffs)

04:59.166 --> 05:00.501
The actor, man.
You know.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.102
The King of Cool.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.537
You know, guy from
The Sand Pebbles.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.540
I don't know.

05:06.574 --> 05:09.242
Man, most black people
don't know who Steve McQueen is.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.045
Really?

05:12.079 --> 05:13.814
Yeah, but I thought,
you know, that you'd be

05:13.847 --> 05:16.049
into that kind of stuff,
but guess not.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.153
But you know who
Steve McQueen is, though.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.755
Yeah, well, I'm Nigerian.

Ah, recording all night
really paid off.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.766
Oh, look, I found
all my mixtapes.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.569
Let's put 'em back
where they belong.

while you have something of mine

I keep that there
for protection.

asking about that poster,

09:01.775 --> 09:04.612

in the first place.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.546
There's already
a rapper Paperboy.

09:06.580 --> 09:07.881
He had that song "Ditty."

09:07.915 --> 09:09.850

this Paper Boi?

Also this
Papuh Boi too.

supposed to spell "failure"

Every nigga can't sell drugs,

just like every nigga
can't rap.

It doesn't matter.

I can't rap and I don't move.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.332

10:35.068 --> 10:36.636
This dude?

10:36.670 --> 10:40.140
No, he wasn't Dominican,
I don't think.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.608
But he was different.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.210
Shaved side of his head.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.377
Pink jacket.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.513
And he wasn't a friend.

10:46.546 --> 10:49.282
Sitting in his car
when I opened up.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.185
Dodge Challenger,
'70s, tan.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.321
Cleaner than
the board of health.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.323
I'll tell you,
smoking a Swisher

10:56.356 --> 10:57.691
with no weed.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.828
Guy gave me the creeps.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.866
Yo.
Zan going on now.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.071

The fuck?

11:12.773 --> 11:15.508
MAN: * Paper Boi, Paper Boi,
Paper Boi... *

11:15.542 --> 11:16.877
What you think?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.347
Bruh.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.882
MAN: * Paper Boi, Paper Boi,
Paper Boi... *

11:21.915 --> 11:23.483
-What you think?

11:23.516 --> 11:26.386
-Bruh.
-Zan?

11:26.419 --> 11:28.421
Nigga, I know that guy.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.690
He used to come down
to the old place.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.726
Word?

11:32.760 --> 11:36.997
In fact, I think I know
where he works.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.100
*

11:40.133 --> 11:41.902
No.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.905
(hip-hop bass thuds)

11:44.938 --> 11:51.378
*

11:51.411 --> 11:54.014
Do you know if you can
block someone on a flip phone?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.849
Why?

11:55.883 --> 11:57.584
'Cause that dude Zan
keeps mass-texting me

11:57.617 --> 11:59.119
every party in Atlanta

11:59.152 --> 12:01.388
and he keeps calling them
"movements"

12:01.421 --> 12:04.524
and I fucking hate him.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.526
Hmm.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.863
Wasn't that dude, like,
half Chinese or something?

12:09.897 --> 12:10.898
I don't know.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.301
Probably.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.568
He was pretty short.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.304
Ni-i-ice!

12:18.738 --> 12:20.140
Chinese people
are short

12:20.173 --> 12:21.474
'cause of Genghis Khan.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.443
-Look it up.
-In what?

12:23.476 --> 12:25.378
The Racism Book?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.380
(Keith Ape's "It G MA Remix"
playing over speaker)

12:27.414 --> 12:28.982
Look, this dude
killed enough people

12:29.016 --> 12:30.918
to lower the temperature
on Earth.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.619
And if he conquered you

12:32.652 --> 12:34.822
and you were bigger
than this wheel he had,

12:34.855 --> 12:36.623
crrk, he'd kill you.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.091
*

12:38.125 --> 12:39.793
Is that true?

12:39.827 --> 12:42.629
You don't think that
had an effect genetically?

12:42.662 --> 12:45.132
Plus, Chinese people
don't like black people no way.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.134
-Look it up.
-Again, where?

12:47.167 --> 12:48.401
*

12:48.435 --> 12:49.803
And he's not Chinese.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.939
I'm not Chinese.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.807
Wait right here, bro.

My man.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.700
Thank you very much.

13:54.767 --> 13:55.702
Yeah?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.071
Brother.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.509
Is he going
to get the money?

14:02.542 --> 14:03.843
Uh...

14:03.877 --> 14:05.678
Got to make a quick
trade up.

14:05.712 --> 14:06.880
It's the last stop.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.382
Come on, Barfight.

Hey, man.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.440
Oh, hey,
what's up, man?

14:33.473 --> 14:34.942
Nigga--

14:34.975 --> 14:36.944
-We need to talk.
-Yeah, sure, we can talk.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.711
I just gotta deliver this,
though, uh...

14:38.745 --> 14:40.981
Ride with me.
We'll talk.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.088
You coming, bro?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.458
(engine turns over)

14:53.660 --> 14:54.995
(sighs)

15:02.435 --> 15:03.770
So what's up, man?

15:03.803 --> 15:05.438
-You working on a mixtape?
-Look, man.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.773
I don't know if you know
what's happening out here,

15:06.806 --> 15:08.308
but this ain't no game,
a'ight?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.743
I'm getting tired of niggas
online harassing me.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.612
Ah, fan engagement.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.647
No, man, you messin'
with my life, man.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.449
This my job.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.418
Helping us get money,
though.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.619
Nigga!

15:19.652 --> 15:21.421
There's no money
anywhere near rap.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.590
Now, I know it look
fun and games on The Shade Room,

15:23.623 --> 15:25.758
but...niggas die.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.460
People are forgotten.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.795
Shit is real.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.402
Yo, can I use that?

15:35.435 --> 15:36.469
Use what, man?

15:36.503 --> 15:38.071
What you just said.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.607
Like, if I was recording this,
could I use that?

15:41.874 --> 15:44.077
Nigga, are you
recording me right now?

15:44.111 --> 15:45.979
I record everything, man.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.414
Everything's valuable
to someone.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.781
Okay, so then you admit it.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.150
You ain't no critic
or a photographer.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.985
You--you like a salesman
or something.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.620
What's the difference?

15:53.653 --> 15:55.088
I mean,
it's all the game.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.456
We're all just hustling.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.191
You too.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.592
'Cause I have to.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.794
I scare people at ATMs,
boy.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.664
So I have to rap.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.299
I mean, that's what rap is--
making the best

16:06.333 --> 16:07.834
out of a bad situation,
brother.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.270
Right.
You're exploiting

16:10.303 --> 16:11.704
your situation.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.340
What?

16:13.373 --> 16:16.809
You're exploiting
your situation to make rap,

16:16.843 --> 16:18.811
and I'm exploiting you
exploiting that.

16:18.845 --> 16:19.746
Money, bro.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.782
(exhales)

16:22.815 --> 16:25.552
Whatever, man.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.555
I, like--I could say
some shit right now,

16:28.588 --> 16:31.724
but I ain't trying to go off
on you with your son back there.

16:31.758 --> 16:32.992
That's not my son.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.361
That's my business partner.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.296
We make Vine videos together.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.298
Hos love this little nigga.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.666
He just needs an edge.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.235
We got a catch phrase, though.
Say it!

16:42.269 --> 16:44.171
Sure I know, bitch!

16:44.204 --> 16:45.672
Hmm.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.507
Try the alt.

Quentin.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.282
Wait.

17:29.316 --> 17:32.051
You got this kid
delivering your pizzas?

17:33.120 --> 17:35.688
Word of mouth.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.590

man?

Hey, you going

19:42.249 --> 19:44.016
Yeah.
Yeah, in September.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.888
What?

19:48.921 --> 19:50.390
Yeah, he's gonna take that

19:50.423 --> 19:53.025
Cane Corso and breed it
with his other Cane Corso.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.861
They're gonna have
Cane Corso puppies.

Are you joking?

No.

You all right,
brother?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.555
No, no, I'm actually
kind of fucked.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.393
Van needed that money.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.894
My daughter needed
that money, okay?

20:27.927 --> 20:30.763
Not in September,
but today.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.932
Okay?
See, I'm poor, Darius.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.801
Okay?
And poor people

20:34.834 --> 20:36.636
don't have time
for investments

20:36.669 --> 20:38.471
because poor people
are too busy

20:38.505 --> 20:40.239
trying not to be poor,
okay?

20:40.273 --> 20:41.308
I need to eat today,

20:41.341 --> 20:42.575
not in September.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.479
Right, I asked you
at the pawn shop,

20:46.513 --> 20:48.815
if you needed the money,
to take the money.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.216
And you said you
wanted more money,

20:50.249 --> 20:53.820
so I got you more money.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.756
(birds chirping
and twittering)

21:12.104 --> 21:13.340
Look.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.441
Here, trade this in.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.611
-No, it's cool, man--
-No, no, it's fine.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.613
I'm just stressed.
I got a lot going on.

21:20.647 --> 21:21.848
No, it's fine.
It's fine.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.182
I get a new one every month.

21:23.215 --> 21:24.984
Make sure they ain't
tracking me.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.690
Thank you.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.998
We're friends now.

(birds chirping)

21:48.741 --> 21:51.711
(Michael Kiwanuka's
"Home Again" plays)

21:51.744 --> 21:54.947
*

21:54.981 --> 21:58.518
KIWANUKA: * Born again,
born again *

21:58.551 --> 22:00.687
*

22:00.720 --> 22:02.221
* One day I know

22:02.254 --> 22:04.891
* I'll feel strong again

22:04.924 --> 22:07.894
* I lift my head

22:07.927 --> 22:11.631
*

22:11.664 --> 22:15.067
* Lost again,
lost again *

22:15.101 --> 22:17.370
*

22:17.404 --> 22:18.905
* One day I know

22:18.938 --> 22:21.173
* Our paths
will cross again *

22:21.207 --> 22:22.509
*

22:22.542 --> 22:25.978
* Smile again,
smile again *

22:26.012 --> 22:28.347
*

22:28.381 --> 22:30.149
* One day I hope

22:30.182 --> 22:32.385
* To make you smile again

22:32.419 --> 22:35.822
* I won't hide

22:35.855 --> 22:39.392
*

22:39.426 --> 22:42.862
* Many times I've been told

22:42.895 --> 22:44.664
*

22:44.697 --> 22:46.232
* Speak your mind

22:46.265 --> 22:49.101
* Just be bold

22:49.135 --> 22:52.204
* So I close my eyes

22:52.238 --> 22:54.474
* Won't look behind
