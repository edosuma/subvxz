And your mother, she's hot. - Hi, Mathilde.

06:58.995 --> 07:01.872

07:03.124 --> 07:06.502
No need to share our happiness with everyone!

07:06.752 --> 07:07.837
Loud music.

07:08.087 --> 07:08.879
Stop the music!

07:11.590 --> 07:12.925
We go to the doctor.

07:13.175 --> 07:13.801
it goes.

07:14.051 --> 07:16.971
- This is the respect
for yourself and others.

07:17.221 --> 07:19.765
- Hey, Paula, is the Techno Parade? - Come on, stop!

07:20.016 --> 07:22.518

07:22.768 --> 07:25.229
Go Daddy. Stop! Let's go!

07:26.022 --> 07:26.856
Come On!

07:34.989 --> 07:37.033
- So. it's not getting better.

07:41.620 --> 07:44.457
- I do not understand. I put cream every night

07:44.707 --> 07:46.542
in my... vagina.

07:46.792 --> 07:49.962
- your mother's thrush has spread.

07:50.212 --> 07:51.881
Your father put the cream I gave him?

07:52.131 --> 07:55.509
- Dad, you put the cream the doctor gave you?

07:56.052 --> 07:59.638
Hoo, hoo! The cream? you put it, yes or no?

08:00.723 --> 08:02.600
- No? - Why?

08:04.810 --> 08:08.272
When I put it, it's lumpy.

08:11.525 --> 08:15.279
I have a vagina on fire! Mushrooms everywhere!

08:16.655 --> 08:19.492
I'll make you some good fried mushrooms.

08:19.658 --> 08:20.743
You'll see. Oh!

08:20.993 --> 08:21.827
Stop!

08:22.078 --> 08:23.913
I'm sorry. - It's ok.

08:24.163 --> 08:27.833
He must put the cream or it will not go away.

08:29.502 --> 08:33.047
- You have to put the cream. It's super important.

08:33.297 --> 08:34.506
- And no more sex...

08:40.763 --> 08:42.181
- How long?

08:42.431 --> 08:43.224
- 3 weeks.

08:48.104 --> 08:49.688
- What, I disagree!

08:49.939 --> 08:53.442
Hold up! You are not animals!

08:56.529 --> 08:58.072
- They understood.

08:58.322 --> 08:59.323
And you, Paula?

08:59.573 --> 09:00.533
- I'm fine.

09:00.783 --> 09:03.411
- Your period? - Hmm ...

09:03.661 --> 09:05.621
- I will make you small treats.

09:05.871 --> 09:10.334
- Still nothing. I'm not in a rush. Well ... Goodbye.

09:28.352 --> 09:31.772
- Come on! It's fresh milk!

09:32.022 --> 09:33.441
Come and taste!

09:33.691 --> 09:35.526

09:53.085 --> 09:54.044
What's wrong with this woman?

09:54.295 --> 09:57.339
- It's called Work Sharing. She smiles, I speak.

09:57.590 --> 09:58.382
- Okay.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.593

10:24.366 --> 10:28.537
I just want to see if everything is well. Reconnect!

10:28.787 --> 10:33.417
You know that in 3 months, there is an election.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.127
And with my team

11:03.030 --> 11:04.990
Thank you. - Excuse me.

11:05.241 --> 11:06.158
The mayor.

11:06.408 --> 11:09.537
My father asks if you can leave. We are working.

11:10.538 --> 11:13.165
- It is you who make us feel
disabled.

11:13.415 --> 11:16.710
- No problem. We, too, we have work to do.

11:16.961 --> 11:19.046

11:32.059 --> 11:34.895
Who called it like this?

11:35.145 --> 11:38.190
- This is my father. Come On. - You give it to me?

11:38.440 --> 11:40.109
- You're sick! - Why?

11:40.359 --> 11:43.112
- Within 3 months, it is sold. 2 days later

11:43.362 --> 11:44.655
it's on your plate.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.949
- Yeah, I understand.

11:47.199 --> 11:48.951
- I love you, girl!

11:49.201 --> 11:51.912
- Well not me. - Bitch!

11:52.162 --> 11:54.331
- They must have so much fun at Karen.

11:56.292 --> 11:59.920
She must have an amazing dress. - A bitchy dress, yes!

12:00.170 --> 12:01.213
- She's going to excite all the guys.

12:01.463 --> 12:05.676
You saw Gaspard today? he irritates me!

12:05.926 --> 12:07.595
- Gabriel must also be excited over her.

12:07.845 --> 12:10.389
That idiot! - What do you find in him?

12:10.639 --> 12:13.017
- I do not know. I have bad taste anyway.

12:13.976 --> 12:17.062
- How do you say "asshole" in sign language?

12:17.313 --> 12:18.647
- ass. - ass.

12:19.315 --> 12:20.858
- hole.

12:21.108 --> 12:25.487
The "ass", the "hole", roughly, is your head.

12:25.738 --> 12:27.823
that suits him, no? - Very good.

12:28.073 --> 12:30.326
- They are starting again!

12:30.576 --> 12:31.869
- Oh no!

12:32.119 --> 12:34.163
- There's no time here!

12:34.413 --> 12:36.248
Loud music.

12:36.498 --> 12:40.919

13:52.741 --> 13:54.076
Next!

13:54.326 --> 13:57.037
Come On! - It's dead!

13:57.287 --> 14:00.708
- Forget it, he's an asshole. - Well, the lady there.

We do not hear anything. - I can not sing.

14:09.758 --> 14:12.678
- And why is that? - No thank you, it's for losers.

14:13.721 --> 14:14.388
- Excuse-me?

14:14.638 --> 14:15.764
- No thank you, it's for losers.

- Alto, perfect. Come On.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.435
- But I ... - Come on.

14:25.733 --> 14:27.276

in the coming years.

15:08.776 --> 15:10.527
This is a new era.

15:10.778 --> 15:12.279
I want to say:

15:12.529 --> 15:13.989
GO Lassay!

15:15.491 --> 15:19.286
- He wants to get back the
agricultural land, this crazy!

15:19.536 --> 15:20.412
- And the forest.

15:22.164 --> 15:23.290
There is the mall too.

15:25.417 --> 15:27.377
- I'm going to defend myself, me.
He'll see!

15:27.628 --> 15:29.213
- What are you going to do?

15:31.840 --> 15:32.925
Stand for election?

15:33.175 --> 15:34.843
No, but you kidding?

15:36.386 --> 15:39.097
- We can beat him together.

15:39.348 --> 15:41.725
- A coalition, the four of us?

15:43.852 --> 15:45.687
- The Belier family!

15:45.938 --> 15:47.397
- You're the greatest, Dad.

15:52.736 --> 15:55.072
Horn.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.698
- What's going on?

15:56.949 --> 15:59.284
- Nothing. There is nothing.

15:59.535 --> 16:01.119
Horn.

16:01.370 --> 16:02.704
- Yes, I see.

16:02.955 --> 16:05.123
- It's just that...

16:05.374 --> 16:10.087
This election thing ...
I don't know if it's a good idea.

16:11.755 --> 16:14.633
- Why?
Because I'm deaf?

16:18.554 --> 16:21.473
This is not a handicap to be deaf.
It is an identity.

16:21.723 --> 16:24.726
- To be a politician,
it is not very practical.

16:24.977 --> 16:27.729
- And Obama, then?
He is really black.

16:27.980 --> 16:29.273
- No correlation!

16:30.357 --> 16:33.151
- It was not a handicap
to become president, perhaps?

16:33.402 --> 16:34.236
- Yeah ...

16:42.411 --> 16:43.453
- The family ...

16:47.416 --> 16:48.709
- Hello. - Hello.

16:48.959 --> 16:52.546
- We come to apply. - Of course.

16:53.589 --> 16:55.674
That's it. - Thank you. Goodbye.

16:55.924 --> 16:57.759
- Goodbye.

16:58.010 --> 16:59.970
- WELCOME Mr. Belien. - Hello.

17:01.221 --> 17:11.220
...

18:10.666 --> 18:11.875
...

18:12.125 --> 18:14.044
- What do you mean, who I am?

18:14.294 --> 18:18.048
I worked with the greatest French singers!

18:18.298 --> 18:21.843
10 years that this fucking rector is refusing me Paris

18:22.094 --> 18:25.180
and I am dying in the middle of nowhere with bumpkins

18:25.430 --> 18:28.183
who think that Gérard Lenorman is from Normandy!

18:28.433 --> 18:32.771
And if you ... What? No, I want to talk to the rector.

18:33.021 --> 18:36.608
It's too much to ask? Pull your fingers off your ass

18:36.858 --> 18:38.777
and pass it to me !!

18:39.027 --> 18:41.363
Hello? Hello?!?

18:41.613 --> 18:44.116
- Damn. - he must be all alone, Thomasson.

18:44.366 --> 18:46.410
- You don't want to volunteer?

18:46.660 --> 18:50.872
This summer? Or a job where we can make some money.

18:51.123 --> 18:53.667
- Why not. do you have a snack?
- I have a Snickers.

18:53.917 --> 18:56.044
- No, disgusting. - My God!

18:59.923 --> 19:01.008
- Noo ...

19:01.258 --> 19:02.592
- Bitch. - I'm not there.

19:02.843 --> 19:05.262
Paula moaned.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.431
- This is nothing ... It happens.

19:07.681 --> 19:08.682
- Let's go.

19:08.932 --> 19:09.975
- No. - Come!

19:10.225 --> 19:11.476
Let's go! - Stop!

19:11.727 --> 19:12.853
- Well then?

19:13.103 --> 19:14.980
So the juniors, not briefing the newbies?

19:15.230 --> 19:17.024
Go, in class.

19:17.774 --> 19:18.859
- I hate my life.

19:19.109 --> 19:19.943
- Good luck.

19:20.193 --> 19:23.196
- Come on, sheeps. - Hello sir.

19:23.447 --> 19:24.322
- Hello.

19:25.615 --> 19:26.491
So.

19:26.742 --> 19:30.412
I rebuke for two years to make a choir sing with

19:30.662 --> 19:34.791
broken voices. Except four or five and the Parisian,

19:35.042 --> 19:39.129
Gabriel Chevignon, This No Man's land !

19:39.379 --> 19:43.341
Anyway I'm punished for I-don't-know-what I did in a previous life.

19:43.592 --> 19:46.553
We will challenge fate and tackle

19:46.803 --> 19:47.929
a monument.

19:48.180 --> 19:50.015
- Michel Sardou ...

19:50.265 --> 19:52.893
- We will work on  Michel Sardou's repertory until the end of this year.

19:53.602 --> 19:54.603
Yes Yes.

19:54.853 --> 19:58.273
When things go wrong, and there is no hope,

19:58.523 --> 20:00.442
Michel Sardou is the solution.

20:00.692 --> 20:02.694
- We can not change?

20:02.944 --> 20:06.156
- Why? That's not good enough for you?

20:06.406 --> 20:08.075
- There's more modern.

20:08.325 --> 20:09.868
- Modern?

20:10.118 --> 20:12.537
Michel Sardou is to the French variety

20:12.788 --> 20:15.373
what Mozart is to classical:

20:15.624 --> 20:17.626
timeless.

20:17.876 --> 20:19.086
Pass.

20:19.920 --> 20:24.549
She runs, she runs The disease of love

20:24.800 --> 20:27.260
In the heart of the children

20:27.511 --> 20:30.764
From 7 to 77 years old

20:31.014 --> 20:34.434
She sings, she sings

20:34.684 --> 20:37.187
Insolent River

20:37.437 --> 20:39.981
Uniting in its bed

20:40.232 --> 20:44.194
Blonde hair, gray hair

20:44.444 --> 20:47.823
- What's going on? We disconnected you?

20:48.073 --> 20:50.659
I hear nothing, I feel nothing.

20:50.909 --> 20:53.745
You do not breathe. Nothing happens!

20:53.995 --> 20:56.790
The technique ... I do not care!

20:58.834 --> 21:02.420
You, the new little girl. Come.

21:02.671 --> 21:03.839
- Me? - Yes.

21:07.425 --> 21:08.468
Sit down.

21:11.012 --> 21:13.682
The ventral breathing, heard about it?

21:13.932 --> 21:15.267
- No. - No?

21:15.517 --> 21:17.769
Spread your feet. That's it.

21:18.019 --> 21:19.187
Plant the sacrum.

21:19.437 --> 21:21.565
Press the pelvic floor.

21:21.815 --> 21:24.067
Open your ribs.

21:24.693 --> 21:28.613
Open. That's it. Breathe. Again.

21:28.864 --> 21:32.159
You feel your diaphragm moving?

21:32.409 --> 21:33.702
- Yes. - Good.

21:33.952 --> 21:36.830
Concentrate and repeat with me.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.043
Ready?

21:42.294 --> 21:44.045
Piano.

21:44.296 --> 21:47.549
- She runs, she runs

21:47.799 --> 21:50.051
The disease of love

21:50.302 --> 21:51.970
- It's not your voice.

21:52.220 --> 21:53.138
- hmm yes.

21:53.388 --> 21:56.641
- No, it's not your voice. Do what I do.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.820
He sings the notes.

22:01.146 --> 22:03.148
She sings the notes.

22:04.316 --> 22:07.277
- Relax the shoulders. That's it. Let go.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.654
Higher notes.

22:12.657 --> 22:13.491
- No eyes.

22:13.742 --> 22:15.118
Straight ahead.

22:16.077 --> 22:17.829
Higher notes.

22:20.415 --> 22:22.667
- Yes, it's starting to come!

22:22.918 --> 22:24.377
Higher notes.

22:26.755 --> 22:28.131
- Open. it's coming.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.759
Higher notes.

22:38.141 --> 22:39.309
- Excuse me.

22:40.143 --> 22:41.519
- It was about time!

22:41.770 --> 22:51.769
...

23:21.485 --> 23:24.279
- Your lap belt. Open. Wide.

23:24.729 --> 23:27.899
Don't sings for your self in the mouth.

23:28.149 --> 23:30.277
What's your name again?

23:30.527 --> 23:33.613
- Paula Belier - Paula Aries.

23:33.863 --> 23:36.992
You are a fucking soprano.

23:37.242 --> 23:39.577
- Of course. - Take it as you want.

23:39.828 --> 23:41.913
But there is someone to wake up inside.

23:42.163 --> 23:43.248
Paula Belier!

23:43.498 --> 23:45.125
Come here. Come.

23:45.375 --> 23:48.336
Would you be up to do a duet together?

23:48.586 --> 23:49.546
- Hmmm ...

23:50.505 --> 23:51.798
- Yes Yes. - Very good.

23:52.048 --> 23:55.135
Learn this song by heart.

23:55.385 --> 23:56.845
Play it out.

23:57.095 --> 23:59.264
- What is it, "I'll love you"?

23:59.514 --> 24:02.017
- "I'm gonna love you." What is it?

24:02.267 --> 24:06.354
A monument. Thank you, Miss Belier.

24:06.604 --> 24:08.398
Gabriel, let's get back to work.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.775
Think about what I said.

24:11.026 --> 24:15.280
Piano.

24:15.530 --> 24:18.533
- Dear parents, I fly

24:19.451 --> 24:22.579
Understand that I fly

24:23.663 --> 24:24.914
Without Smoke

24:25.165 --> 24:27.459
No Alcohol

24:27.709 --> 24:31.087
LI fly, I fly

24:32.047 --> 24:38.928
...

24:39.179 --> 24:41.306
She screams.

24:43.808 --> 24:45.810
A shrill scream.

24:54.569 --> 24:55.987
A serious sound.

25:00.075 --> 25:01.701
A high-pitched.

25:04.579 --> 25:06.456
A very serious sound.

25:07.499 --> 25:17.498
...

25:20.720 --> 25:24.265
- Thank you. Goodbye. - Thank you. Good day.

25:28.311 --> 25:31.189
Yeah, that's good. This is bold.

25:31.439 --> 25:33.441
Yes, no ... it's great!

25:36.194 --> 25:37.946
Between the two, who do I choose?

25:38.196 --> 25:38.905
I'm not voting.

25:39.155 --> 25:41.116
- AH, MR BELIER!

25:41.366 --> 25:45.662
So, is it moving forward this campaign?

25:45.912 --> 25:48.581
A beautiful poster! - Cheese, Mr. Mayor?

25:48.832 --> 25:50.667
- No, thank you. No thank you.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.961
I congratulate your father.

25:53.211 --> 25:55.797
- He congratulates you.
- What a little shit!

25:56.047 --> 25:57.132
- What ...

25:58.133 --> 25:59.467
- He thanks you.

25:59.717 --> 26:01.553
- It's nice. Me too.

26:01.803 --> 26:02.720
- I'll smash you.

26:02.971 --> 26:04.222
- What?? ...

26:04.472 --> 26:05.932
- He is asking you if you are ok.

26:06.182 --> 26:09.477
- Yes. I am delighted to have such an opponent.

26:09.727 --> 26:12.397
The victory will be even greater.

26:12.647 --> 26:14.399
- I'll blow you the two legs.

26:16.484 --> 26:17.527
- Stop!

26:17.777 --> 26:21.030
- I'll take some cheese. - Yes.

26:21.281 --> 26:23.074
- Not strong. - But no.

26:23.324 --> 26:24.159
- Say.

26:24.409 --> 26:28.455
Your father thinks that people will vote for a deaf?

26:28.705 --> 26:31.124
- Why not. They have already vote for an idiot.

26:32.876 --> 26:35.462
- It is very elegant, miss.

26:35.712 --> 26:36.754
it promises

26:37.005 --> 26:40.216
a high-level campaign. Forget the cheese.

26:40.467 --> 26:41.801
- Yeah ...

26:42.051 --> 26:44.262
- Over there. Good ... Come on!

26:48.224 --> 26:51.352
- I told him you were going to smash it.

26:54.856 --> 26:56.483
- If you do what you have noted,

26:56.733 --> 27:00.403
on schools and housing, it will bring you the votes.

27:00.653 --> 27:03.031
- Rudolph, you got no chance.

27:03.281 --> 27:06.701
Nobody supports Lapidus, but you'll lose.

27:10.038 --> 27:11.998
- You do not know the story.

27:12.248 --> 27:14.292
Telling him "impossible" will motivate him more.

27:16.169 --> 27:19.088
He wanted to take his uncle's farm.

27:19.339 --> 27:20.715
I told him "impossible".

27:22.425 --> 27:24.886
We lived in Fresnes, though.

27:25.136 --> 27:27.805
When he announced to my parents,

27:28.056 --> 27:30.475
they also said "impossible".

27:30.725 --> 27:33.394
When he has an idea in mind, you better be

27:33.645 --> 27:34.646
behind him

27:34.896 --> 27:37.023
and not in front- I support him.

27:37.273 --> 27:39.609
I vote for him.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.694
- Yes, we need to support him.

27:41.945 --> 27:43.613
- But during this time,

27:43.863 --> 27:45.740
Lapidus distributes grants.

27:45.990 --> 27:48.952
We, we are nice, but what is it for?

27:53.048 --> 27:55.592
- Guys, me, I believe in it.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.210
I have the ability.

27:57.460 --> 28:00.713
Although I have 1 chance in 1000, I tried.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.467
I decide my fate.

28:11.849 --> 28:14.018
- That's good. Perfect.

28:14.269 --> 28:18.565
"The disease of Love" speaks of the love with a capital "L".

28:18.815 --> 28:21.568
And there is no love in your voice.

28:21.818 --> 28:25.530
it's never happened to you, pimply?

28:25.780 --> 28:30.326
You don't know those shudders that twist the guts?

28:30.577 --> 28:33.496
Has to come out, it drains,

28:33.746 --> 28:38.793
otherwise it will rot. You'll all die of colon cancer.

28:39.043 --> 28:43.840
The song is your manure pit. So feel it, damn it!

28:45.633 --> 28:46.926
With your guts.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.307
Yeah right, go. Out.

28:55.393 --> 28:56.936
You learned the song?

28:57.186 --> 28:58.396
- Yes. - Yes.

28:58.646 --> 29:00.064
- Very good.

29:00.315 --> 29:03.568
So ready? 3, 4, ...

29:03.818 --> 29:05.987
Piano.

29:06.237 --> 29:09.699
- To make fade all the Marquis de Sade

29:09.949 --> 29:11.993
- To make blush whores of the harbor

29:12.243 --> 29:14.579
- What is happening?

29:14.829 --> 29:17.373
Well, that's what we'll do.

29:17.624 --> 29:19.667
start again but dancing.

29:19.917 --> 29:20.668
- Dancing?

29:20.918 --> 29:22.462
- Yes. - But what?

29:22.712 --> 29:23.671
- Slow Dance.

29:23.921 --> 29:25.298
Come closer.

29:27.425 --> 29:29.594
A technique of Stone and Charden.

29:29.844 --> 29:33.222
I remember in '76, during the heat wave ...

29:33.473 --> 29:34.474
get closer.

29:35.308 --> 29:37.435
Come on. It is like adhesive.

29:37.935 --> 29:38.936
That's it.

29:39.187 --> 29:40.563
And sing.

29:43.358 --> 29:46.319
- To make fade all the Marquis de Sade

29:46.569 --> 29:49.113
- To make blush whores of the harbor

29:49.364 --> 29:50.448
- Gnagnagna ...

29:50.698 --> 29:52.867
It's a song about desire,

36:36.437 --> 36:37.480
- How do you know?

36:37.730 --> 36:39.857

36:42.735 --> 36:44.236
- you ok, Gabriel?

36:48.157 --> 36:50.117
- What did I do?

36:52.953 --> 36:55.873
A tradition among the Jews? We are not Jews.

36:59.418 --> 37:00.628
- Well, I'm going.

37:00.878 --> 37:02.088
- You do not want to ...

37:02.338 --> 37:04.673
- Thank you. Bye.

37:04.924 --> 37:06.217
- Fuck!

37:06.467 --> 37:07.384
being deaf

37:07.635 --> 37:08.844
does not excuse everything!

37:09.095 --> 37:10.721
You are pissing me off!

37:15.017 --> 37:17.895
- He saw the stain? - I don't know.

37:18.145 --> 37:22.858
I want to be a mouse or broccoli, but not me!

37:23.109 --> 37:25.986
- He is a guy. He won't figure out.

37:26.237 --> 37:29.156
- I'm sure he didn't get it. He just came for a slow dance.

37:29.406 --> 37:31.033
- You're a woman.

37:31.283 --> 37:34.370
- Don't start as well. I didn't ask anything.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.498
- Hey, Paula! Pistachio ...

37:37.748 --> 37:39.875
You got a spot. Pistachio.

37:40.126 --> 37:41.961
- Are you done?

37:45.297 --> 37:46.841
-  the bitch!

37:50.636 --> 37:52.721
are you ok? - Mmm.

37:57.726 --> 37:58.519
Hey!

37:59.979 --> 38:03.941
You're a little asshole. You are shallow, you are nothing!

38:06.694 --> 38:08.404
- Silence!

38:08.654 --> 38:11.824
At your seats. - I'll explain.

38:12.074 --> 38:14.910
- Show in 3 months. Time to start working.

38:15.161 --> 38:16.162
I hear nothing.

38:16.412 --> 38:18.122
- YES! - There.

38:18.372 --> 38:21.458
Colon cancer. Remember.

38:21.709 --> 38:25.421
Your scores on the 2nd chorus. Stand up.

38:27.590 --> 38:28.841
1, 2.

38:29.091 --> 38:30.426
1, 2, 3, 4.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.219
Piano.

38:32.469 --> 38:35.890
- When doing java, Saturday on Broadway

38:36.140 --> 38:38.225
We dance on the sidewalks

38:38.475 --> 38:40.561
- Come On. This is the java!

38:40.811 --> 38:43.981
Come On! That's ... - On blows of watering

38:45.357 --> 38:47.193
And we do not know at noon

38:47.443 --> 38:49.195
- That's good. Let go!

38:49.445 --> 38:51.822
- If you are in Clichy - Broadway!

38:52.072 --> 38:54.867
- Or in California

38:55.117 --> 38:59.163
When doing java Saturday on Broadway

38:59.413 --> 39:01.457
as it swings in Meudon

39:01.707 --> 39:04.793
We just go crazy, no need for Beaujolais

39:05.044 --> 39:07.880
When we have some bourbon

39:08.130 --> 39:11.759
This may not be the true reality

39:12.009 --> 39:13.510
the java of Broadway

39:14.845 --> 39:16.722
Yes, but that's the one they like

39:21.352 --> 39:24.772
- You have a gem in the throat.

39:25.022 --> 39:27.775
And she is angry, your gem.

39:28.025 --> 39:30.486
Would to like to learn singing in Paris?

39:30.736 --> 39:31.570
- Me?

39:31.820 --> 39:35.157
- 10 years that my students fail the contest,

39:35.407 --> 39:37.826
but with you and ...

39:38.077 --> 39:39.578
Gabriel? Come.

39:40.412 --> 39:42.623
With you and Gabriel we have our chances.

39:42.873 --> 39:46.001
The competition is in three months, after the show.

39:46.252 --> 39:47.586
- 3 months ...

39:47.836 --> 39:51.715
- It's short, but you will get there. There's some work.

39:51.966 --> 39:53.968
You have a gift.

39:54.218 --> 39:56.762
- If I am taken? - You will go to Paris,

39:57.012 --> 40:00.266
the opera, the best teachers ...

40:00.516 --> 40:02.268
while continuing high school.

40:02.518 --> 40:07.147
So what? What do you think? what a dream, right?

40:09.358 --> 40:10.192
- No.

40:13.279 --> 40:16.407
- Wait. Paula ... The door slams.

40:16.657 --> 40:18.784
- Mathilde!

40:19.034 --> 40:20.411
- I'm coming!

40:21.954 --> 40:24.707
- Sorry, but ... - No, everything is fine.

40:24.957 --> 40:26.709
Well, what's going on?

40:27.209 --> 40:29.670
Call you later. See you.

40:29.920 --> 40:33.299
It's amazing! - I can't go to Paris.

40:33.549 --> 40:35.050
- But why?

40:35.301 --> 40:37.511
-  My parents ... - Stop.

40:37.761 --> 40:42.391
They are deaf, not puppies. How were they doing before you were born?

40:42.641 --> 40:45.436
You want to do this school? - I think so.

40:45.686 --> 40:49.148
- You think or you're sure? - I'm sure.

40:49.398 --> 40:52.568
- So take the competition. You'll see later.

40:53.485 --> 40:56.071
- Yeah, but ... - Stop. This is good.

40:56.322 --> 40:58.866
You don't want to spend your life here, eating cheese?

40:59.116 --> 41:01.660
You got a gift. You realize?

41:01.910 --> 41:04.663
Damn, my best friend has a gift!

41:09.835 --> 41:19.834
...

41:24.975 --> 41:26.643
- You're scared?

41:28.020 --> 41:38.019
...

42:01.178 --> 42:03.514
- Mr. Thomasson? - Yes. Two seconds.

42:05.557 --> 42:07.309
What is it?

42:09.478 --> 42:11.313
- OK for the contest.

42:11.563 --> 42:13.649
- Are you sure? - And you?

42:13.899 --> 42:17.694
- Sure. And your parents? - They are not against.

42:17.945 --> 42:20.572
- Good, but it will not be "cool".

42:20.823 --> 42:23.826
Many are called, few are chosen. Will have to work.

42:24.076 --> 42:26.662
You are aware? - Yes.

42:26.912 --> 42:30.290
- Very good. See you every night at 6 pm

42:30.541 --> 42:34.545
including weekends until the contest. We agree?

42:34.795 --> 42:36.505
- Yeah. - Very good.

42:37.214 --> 42:38.841
So see you tonight.

42:39.091 --> 42:43.011
13 chemin de la manufacture au Horps. Don't be late.

42:43.262 --> 42:44.388
- Yes.

42:47.099 --> 42:50.185
I've called you as soon as I could, Ms. Delton.

42:50.436 --> 42:55.274
This is normal, the overdraft. The cooperative has not paid us yet.

42:56.608 --> 42:58.902
What? I don't know. Ask them.

43:00.320 --> 43:02.865
Goodbye. Thank you, Ms. Delton.

43:03.866 --> 43:05.868
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

43:09.204 --> 43:10.289
- Hi.

43:11.039 --> 43:12.541
Don't say Hi!

43:12.791 --> 43:15.043
- Put it there, Paula.

43:15.294 --> 43:17.921
You can put your stuff there.

43:18.464 --> 43:23.177
You thought of a song? - Not really.

43:24.052 --> 43:25.053
- Here you go.

43:26.763 --> 43:30.225
- "I fly"? This is the song of Gabriel.

43:30.476 --> 43:33.395
- Yes. Gabriel won't pass the contest this year.

43:33.645 --> 43:35.481
- Really? - No, he molted.

43:35.731 --> 43:39.401
- He molted? - Yes. He lost his voice.

43:39.651 --> 43:42.404
The rules are strict.

43:42.654 --> 43:45.782
A boy who molted can not apply to the contest.

43:47.993 --> 43:52.247
- Actually, I know ... It's my fault. We had a fight ...

43:52.498 --> 43:55.417
- No

43:55.667 --> 43:57.211
The land doesn't revolve around you.

43:57.261 --> 43:59.888
You will soon realize.

44:00.339 --> 44:01.381
- For the duet,

44:01.632 --> 44:02.591
what do we do?

44:02.841 --> 44:07.304
- The choir? He can do it. Well, let's start.

44:07.554 --> 44:09.723
The song is not so easy.

44:09.973 --> 44:12.518
- Can we do "by Singing" instead? I know it better.

44:14.853 --> 44:15.687
- OK.

44:15.938 --> 44:17.397
If you want.

44:17.940 --> 44:19.233
- Thank you.

44:21.693 --> 44:24.530
- Good? Go.

44:27.324 --> 44:29.618
- When I was a little boy

44:29.868 --> 44:32.579
I was learning my lessons

44:32.829 --> 44:34.623
Singing

44:35.832 --> 44:38.418
And many years later

44:38.669 --> 44:41.463
I was chasing my dark thoughts

44:41.713 --> 44:43.131
by Singing

44:44.925 --> 44:47.302
This is much less worrisome

44:47.553 --> 44:51.223
To talk about the weather by Singing

44:53.934 --> 44:56.687
But it's so cute

44:56.937 --> 45:00.065
To be called an asshole - Although ...

45:00.315 --> 45:02.109
- In the song - That's good.

45:02.359 --> 45:04.486
- Life is more fun

45:04.736 --> 45:07.489
This is less hopeless

45:07.739 --> 45:08.824
by Singing

45:11.159 --> 45:12.452
The first girl

45:12.703 --> 45:15.455
in my life on the street, I followed

The light is beautiful. Uh it's good there?

48:59.721 --> 49:05.101
We will shoot footage on the farm for the interview.

OK? Let's go.

49:15.737 --> 49:16.988

It's every morning? - Yes.

49:19.449 --> 49:21.368
- You start with Gigi.

49:21.618 --> 49:24.120
Handheld, we follow.

49:24.371 --> 49:27.791
And then what happens?

49:28.041 --> 49:30.836
- Quentin and I are going to school.

49:31.086 --> 49:33.338
My father is in the fields

49:33.588 --> 49:36.299
and my mother makes cheese.

49:36.550 --> 49:37.300
- Let's go.

49:37.551 --> 49:41.346
What is that, Paula? - camembert and brie.

49:41.596 --> 49:42.848
- Super. Want some?

49:52.607 --> 49:56.194
- Paula! Smile! Think of your beloved ... Super!

50:03.410 --> 50:05.537
- He signed and I translate. - OK.

50:05.787 --> 50:15.786
...

50:25.640 --> 50:26.349
- Super.

50:29.019 --> 50:30.270
Are you ready?

50:31.855 --> 50:34.232
Mr. Belier, you decided to stand for

50:34.482 --> 50:36.818
the municipal elections of Lassay.

50:37.068 --> 50:38.278
Why?

50:41.489 --> 50:43.950
- In recent years,
businesses close.

50:44.200 --> 50:45.410
Our young people are leaving.

50:45.660 --> 50:47.829
There are no more doctor
and the school is deserted.

50:50.040 --> 50:53.168
You think what?
I'll let fate?

50:54.669 --> 50:55.587
By being all together

50:55.837 --> 50:59.049
we will reinvigorate Lassay
and give it a new impetus.

51:01.092 --> 51:04.054
- I want to give a new impetus to Lassay.

51:11.186 --> 51:13.396
- But you are deaf.

51:13.647 --> 51:17.567
Don't you think it is a handicap to be mayor of a village?

51:21.863 --> 51:23.239
- Absolutely not.

51:23.490 --> 51:27.452
being deaf has never stopped me
from working, or living.

51:27.702 --> 51:30.497
Why would it prevent me
from being mayor?

51:32.624 --> 51:34.250
- No.

51:40.507 --> 51:42.133
Not at all.

51:42.884 --> 51:44.135
- You're sure to translate everything?

51:44.386 --> 51:46.805
- Yeah, I translate everything.
As usual.

51:47.055 --> 51:49.641
- Why  does she make​this face,
then?

51:49.891 --> 51:53.061
- Your father is right. it's not going there.

51:53.311 --> 51:55.647
- I don't know,
why she's making this face.

51:55.897 --> 51:58.441
- Can we take Again?

51:58.692 --> 52:00.110
Can we?

52:00.694 --> 52:01.695
- Translate.

52:02.779 --> 52:05.490
- We will proceed differently.

52:05.740 --> 52:08.576
You will subtitle my answers.

52:08.827 --> 52:10.662
You will find someone

52:10.954 --> 52:13.456
to translate what I say.

52:15.542 --> 52:17.460
If you speak slowly,

52:17.711 --> 52:18.795
I'll read your lips.

52:19.045 --> 52:21.798
If we do not understand each other, you'll write.

52:22.757 --> 52:23.758
- Okay.

52:24.009 --> 52:25.468
- Thank you. You can go.

52:26.344 --> 52:28.513
- So, you ...

52:28.763 --> 52:32.183
OK. Let's go on.

52:33.935 --> 52:35.270
Mr. Belier ,

52:35.520 --> 52:40.275
you complain about Lapidus project ...

52:40.525 --> 52:44.154
Thunder rumbles.

52:44.404 --> 52:54.403
...

52:58.710 --> 53:01.713
- Mr. Thomasson! It's me, Paula!

53:01.963 --> 53:02.964
Sir?

53:04.591 --> 53:07.552
Sir. ?! - Are you kidding me?

53:07.802 --> 53:10.346
- It's not my fault. I was delayed.

53:10.597 --> 53:13.058
- It's not a self-service here!

53:13.308 --> 53:15.727
Go back home and question your commitment.

53:15.977 --> 53:18.938
- Open! It's raining, please!

53:19.189 --> 53:20.231
Fuck!

53:24.986 --> 53:26.279
Oh...

53:30.283 --> 53:31.910
A door slams.

53:42.837 --> 53:45.256
- To apologize to Dad? For what?

53:45.507 --> 53:46.800
To have a life?

53:48.635 --> 53:50.386
Ah, I'm exhausting you?

53:51.387 --> 53:55.100
- It's great to have a lover,
but we are waiting for you.

53:55.350 --> 53:57.185
- I'm not in love.

54:16.913 --> 54:19.541
I have something important to tell you.

54:20.333 --> 54:22.252
No, I'm not pregnant.

54:24.462 --> 54:27.924
I present the masters of Radio France.

54:28.174 --> 54:29.634
A singing school in Paris.

54:29.884 --> 54:33.471
Mr. Thomasson, my singing teacher, think I can get it.

54:35.306 --> 54:36.724
Yeah, in Paris.

54:40.270 --> 54:42.814
No, I don't want to go to Paris.

54:43.064 --> 54:44.607
This is the school that is in Paris.

54:45.859 --> 54:47.944
Yes, I sing and I belong to

54:48.194 --> 54:49.904
the choir of the school.

54:52.490 --> 54:54.492
For 3 months.

54:56.119 --> 54:57.954
Yes, 3 months or so.

55:00.915 --> 55:02.250
He did not know.

55:07.672 --> 55:10.925
I was afraid you thought I abandon you.

55:20.810 --> 55:24.105
I'm a baby? You told me that I was a woman!

55:25.648 --> 55:26.733
I had my period twice

55:26.983 --> 55:29.444
Thank you.

55:32.906 --> 55:35.325
For high school, I manage.

55:35.575 --> 55:38.161
I repeat every evening at my teacher's.

55:43.041 --> 55:43.958
You understand what?

55:47.086 --> 55:48.713
The farm, the market,

55:48.963 --> 55:52.258
Dad's Campaign ... How to organize?

55:52.508 --> 55:54.719
We must think about another solution.

55:58.139 --> 55:59.682
What, my brother?

56:02.644 --> 56:04.896
He's big, strong and I trust him.

56:10.568 --> 56:12.695
- What do you think, you?

56:15.615 --> 56:17.742
- You go to sleep? Daddy!

56:22.705 --> 56:24.666
No, I'm not happy.

56:32.173 --> 56:34.008
- I will be able to take her room?

56:38.388 --> 56:40.598
A door slams.

56:45.436 --> 56:48.523
- Our daughter wants to become a singer.
Do you realize?

56:48.773 --> 56:50.441
- And then? She sings!

56:54.404 --> 56:56.155
- She is in danger.

56:56.406 --> 56:59.075
And this is not Holland
who will save her.

57:08.418 --> 57:11.796
His teacher says
that she has a beautiful voice.

57:12.046 --> 57:14.507
- Because you have already heard,
you, her voice?

57:15.133 --> 57:16.467
- Very funny!

57:22.223 --> 57:25.184
- She just started.
Maybe it'll pass her.

57:26.060 --> 57:27.520
- Oh yes?

57:27.770 --> 57:29.564
Imagine if she is taken.

57:29.814 --> 57:31.274
All alone in Paris.

57:32.233 --> 57:34.235
- This is not what scares you.

57:34.485 --> 57:37.780
You're afraid that we
are going to be all alone here.

57:42.076 --> 57:44.329
- You know that's my baby.

57:44.579 --> 57:47.165
- You baby,
she bleeds from her kitty anyway!

57:50.877 --> 57:53.212
For the farm, take a clerk.

57:53.463 --> 57:55.173
We should have done it
long ago.

57:55.423 --> 57:57.759
- It will be perfect! Thank you.

58:01.387 --> 58:03.139
Stop, I do not want.

58:08.770 --> 58:10.104
that's enough!

58:18.112 --> 58:20.448
- With this finger. Cheese. - Ah OK.

58:20.698 --> 58:22.033
- There.

58:22.283 --> 58:26.204
You make a "c", the yoghurt pot. Yogurt.

58:26.454 --> 58:29.665
- Oh, you eat, actually. - Yeah, that's it.

58:29.916 --> 58:33.669
Forget it. The most important is to count.

58:33.920 --> 58:36.047
that's "euro". - Euro.

58:36.297 --> 58:40.051
- 1 euro, 2 euros, 3 euros...

58:40.301 --> 58:42.053
- 3 euros, 4 euros ...

58:42.303 --> 58:44.263
Yeah. - Okay. That's it.

58:49.310 --> 58:50.311
What?

58:53.606 --> 58:55.191
He wants to teach you to sign.

58:56.984 --> 58:59.278
You take me for a Kinder? - It's not stupid.

58:59.529 --> 59:02.281
That way you study your Spanish.

59:05.827 --> 59:07.245
- Good. OK.

59:07.495 --> 59:11.541
Touch a hair of my girlfriend and I kill you.

59:14.335 --> 59:18.297
- Thank you, Miss Belier,  to honor me with your presence.

59:18.548 --> 59:21.175
Did you rehearse? - Yes.

59:21.968 --> 59:25.096
One question, why Gabriel is not coming anymore?

59:25.346 --> 59:28.307
- Why? You don't speak with him anymore?

59:28.558 --> 59:32.645
In your opinion? He is depressed, unmotivated.

59:32.895 --> 59:35.523
Even in the shower, he is not singing.

59:35.773 --> 59:38.359
- We can't do anything? - I do not know.

59:41.988 --> 59:44.198
- For the choir, the duet?

59:44.449 --> 59:48.077
- He decided to stop. I'm not responsible.

59:48.327 --> 59:51.330
Yeah, what a mess.

59:51.581 --> 59:53.791
The duet, you will do it alone.

59:55.710 --> 59:57.837
Yeah, well ... let's start?

59:58.087 --> 59:59.964
- I really have a gift?

01:00:00.214 --> 01:00:03.176
- Paula, doubt everything. Never me.

01:00:03.426 --> 01:00:05.970
Agree? - Yeah.

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:12.935
it was?

01:00:14.187 --> 01:00:16.272
Yes. Matilda, the market ...

01:00:17.273 --> 01:00:20.151
Oh yeah, you sold nothing .

01:00:20.401 --> 01:00:23.237
And you don't have sex anymore? What's the connection?

01:00:23.488 --> 01:00:26.157
Is that me? it has nothing to do!

01:00:28.409 --> 01:00:31.078
Mathilde, a disaster? Stop!

01:00:31.329 --> 01:00:33.206
Your face, what is it?

01:00:34.624 --> 01:00:36.042
Eczema.

01:00:38.252 --> 01:00:39.587
It is nervous?

01:00:42.381 --> 01:00:46.636
She is a beginner. Give her some time. She is intelligent.

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:49.764
There!

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:53.392
If it doen't work, It's your fault. You make no effort.

01:01:00.858 --> 01:01:04.529
Mathilde laughed. - I ride you?

01:01:04.779 --> 01:01:07.198
Oh no, I'm in love ...

01:01:07.448 --> 01:01:10.409
- I'm not bothering you? - Oh, we kidding.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:15.206
I have not been really good at the market. - Thanks, I'm aware of it.

01:01:15.456 --> 01:01:18.960
- Your brother continues to give me lessons.

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:20.586
- Great!

01:01:22.004 --> 01:01:23.005
- OK...

01:01:23.256 --> 01:01:25.216
You ...

01:01:25.466 --> 01:01:26.884
Well, I'm going.

01:01:27.134 --> 01:01:29.470
Bye, Quentin.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.472
See you tomorrow.

01:01:32.515 --> 01:01:35.893
I saw Stéphane at the market. - You hooked up?

01:01:37.687 --> 01:01:40.356
- He told me
that Gabriel had an accident.

01:01:42.692 --> 01:01:43.985
- And is he okay?

01:01:44.235 --> 01:01:48.614
- Yes. He stoled the car of her grandmother on landed on a roundabout.

01:01:48.864 --> 01:01:50.658
And he talked about you.

01:01:50.908 --> 01:01:52.910
And I didn't hook up with Stephane.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.037
- Excuse me, I become dumb.

01:01:59.417 --> 01:02:00.459
Paula moaned.

01:02:09.176 --> 01:02:13.639
Spatula pat on the pan.

01:02:20.146 --> 01:02:22.898
is it you who slept on the couch?

01:02:27.153 --> 01:02:28.154
Well ...

01:02:29.238 --> 01:02:30.740
ok, bye!

01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:39.749
- Let us see each other this summer.

01:02:41.167 --> 01:02:44.003
- I am going. Have fun. - Bye.

01:02:50.893 --> 01:02:52.311
- What are you looking at?

01:02:52.762 --> 01:02:56.724
- Nothing, I look nothing. I watch what I want.

01:02:56.974 --> 01:03:00.311
You're not going to class? - You understand quickly.

01:03:00.561 --> 01:03:05.149
- If not, are you ok? The accident? Who was there? Your grandmother?

01:03:05.399 --> 01:03:08.319
- He was my father. Are you stupid or what?

01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:11.947
- I can not help if your voice molted. - What are you talking about?

01:03:12.198 --> 01:03:14.784
- Why did you stop the show?

01:03:16.077 --> 01:03:18.329
- Do not worry, bullshit? - No.

01:03:18.579 --> 01:03:21.540
This is the first time I miss class!

01:03:21.791 --> 01:03:26.712
- Your parents are interested in you. - Your father leave you alone.

01:03:26.962 --> 01:03:29.215
- Or he doesn't give a crap.

01:03:30.591 --> 01:03:33.761
We take the car and we drive to Paris.

01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:35.179
- Of course!

01:03:35.429 --> 01:03:36.847
- You do not want?

01:03:37.098 --> 01:03:39.517
- Really? Stop, you can not.

01:03:39.767 --> 01:03:44.522
- Why? you don't have the balls! - You're a guy, you!

01:03:45.398 --> 01:03:49.360
With the car of your granny, you drive without a license.

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:50.945
- So we go?

01:03:52.613 --> 01:03:56.367
- Oh my! it will solve all your problems.

01:03:56.617 --> 01:03:59.245
- What do you do? - I leave. You're annoying me.

01:04:02.623 --> 01:04:05.918
- Ma, me, mi, mo, mu

01:04:06.627 --> 01:04:08.796
A, e ....

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:11.757
Mom, I told you to knock!

01:04:14.135 --> 01:04:14.969
My sweater!

01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:17.847
It has shrunk!

01:04:18.848 --> 01:04:20.141
Yes, it has shrunk!

01:04:23.644 --> 01:04:25.104
Sorry, my ass!

01:04:29.108 --> 01:04:30.609
No it was not too big. I'm not small.

01:04:32.403 --> 01:04:34.238
To get me used to do laundry?

01:04:35.865 --> 01:04:38.284
To live alone? I am not gone yet!

01:04:40.661 --> 01:04:45.040
Where are we? You always upset.

01:04:46.959 --> 01:04:48.002
Which solution?

01:04:52.506 --> 01:04:53.716
But ...

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:56.343
Rossigneux will translate the meeting?

01:04:56.594 --> 01:04:58.929
I thought he was a shame for the deafs?

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.641
- we learn
to live without you.

01:05:02.892 --> 01:05:04.727
- I'm not dead! I'm here.

01:05:04.977 --> 01:05:07.438
I told you that I'll help you.

01:05:07.688 --> 01:05:09.440
Yes, I'm busy, but ...

01:05:18.324 --> 01:05:21.285
*-Test, test.

01:05:21.535 --> 01:05:22.828
One two.

01:05:31.086 --> 01:05:33.756
- My wife told you
to make an effort on your outfit.

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:38.385
- You do not like my stripes? It's my wedding suit.

01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:42.848
- I don't get it, I rehearsed all week.

01:05:43.098 --> 01:05:46.644
- I do not understand. Remember Mike Brant.

01:05:46.894 --> 01:05:50.898
He spoke no French. He didn't understand what he was singing.

01:05:51.148 --> 01:05:53.692
And suddenly, he was sublime!

01:05:53.943 --> 01:05:56.904
The problem is that you think too much.

01:05:57.154 --> 01:05:58.447
Try to be dumb.

01:05:59.573 --> 01:06:00.825
Huh?

01:06:03.911 --> 01:06:04.787
Yeah.

01:06:06.831 --> 01:06:08.123
Mike Brant.

01:06:22.763 --> 01:06:24.598
- The hearing! The hearing ...

01:06:29.603 --> 01:06:31.730
The sight. The sight ...

01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:38.112
The mouth.

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:40.990
Taste? Yeah!

01:06:43.284 --> 01:06:45.035
Taste.

01:06:45.286 --> 01:06:46.954
Hubbub.

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:52.710
...

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.045
- Thank you! Ah, hello!

01:06:55.296 --> 01:07:02.344
...

01:07:05.598 --> 01:07:08.976
...

01:07:10.144 --> 01:07:11.312
- Ah!

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:13.564
Hello everyone.

01:07:13.814 --> 01:07:15.983
Yeah, welcome everyone.

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:18.402
- Breasts?

01:07:19.653 --> 01:07:21.780
Nipples.

01:07:22.823 --> 01:07:24.575
Tits!

01:07:24.825 --> 01:07:25.993
OK.

01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:30.414
Rub?

01:07:30.664 --> 01:07:33.167
Uh ... Scratch? itch?

01:07:35.044 --> 01:07:37.546
Hmm ... How ...

01:07:42.843 --> 01:07:45.095
Cuddling? Cuddling, OK.

01:07:45.346 --> 01:07:46.764
Cuddling, yes.

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:50.351
Mathilde moaned.

01:07:50.601 --> 01:07:52.269
She laughed.

01:07:56.357 --> 01:07:57.441
- Come On!

01:08:07.159 --> 01:08:09.078
- It's part of my priorities.

01:08:10.371 --> 01:08:13.749
- You plan to do anything for my Internet connection?

01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:20.421
- Nothing.

01:08:21.881 --> 01:08:24.760
Your farm is 2 km from the highway.

01:08:26.303 --> 01:08:29.139
If you want Internet, you will have to move.

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:31.308
- No one will vote for you!

01:08:35.395 --> 01:08:38.314
- He is right. Stop complaining!

01:08:38.564 --> 01:08:39.858
- OH!!!

01:08:40.109 --> 01:08:42.486
- Lapidus gave you the wrong habits.

01:08:42.736 --> 01:08:44.779
We talk about the community.

01:08:45.029 --> 01:08:47.198
It is written: "I hear you."

01:08:49.868 --> 01:08:51.912
This is not to listen to your bullshit.

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:53.162
- It's crazy!

01:08:53.413 --> 01:08:55.165
- He lost, Belier!

01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:58.167
- What? It's hot?

01:08:58.419 --> 01:09:01.130
It's odd, that. This is ...

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.173
Normally, it is not like that.

01:09:03.424 --> 01:09:04.925
What? it burns?

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:06.135
I take it off.

01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:09.179
And ...

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:11.180
something's wrong with the color!

01:09:13.475 --> 01:09:14.435
Quentin?

01:09:14.685 --> 01:09:17.354
- We need to open up to the world. Open yourself.

01:09:18.948 --> 01:09:21.908
- You are like plucked chickens.

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:24.403
- Mathilde, not now!

01:09:24.653 --> 01:09:27.906
- Your brother fainted. He woke up.

01:09:28.157 --> 01:09:29.700
Yes, he is breathing!

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:31.702
Hubbub.

01:09:31.952 --> 01:09:33.912
- You are disabled!

01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:39.710
- This is an anaphylactic shock.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.796
It's like an allergic reaction.

01:09:43.087 --> 01:09:45.256
- Quentin has an allergy.

01:09:45.966 --> 01:09:49.261
Allergy to what? - To latex, I guess.

01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:52.346
Goodbye.

01:09:54.767 --> 01:09:56.060
- How much we owe you?

01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:58.937
- Do not worry, go. - Thank you.

01:09:59.188 --> 01:10:02.191
You can bring her back? - Of course.

01:10:05.652 --> 01:10:08.113
- I can not take more of your Mathilde.

01:10:09.782 --> 01:10:10.000
...

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:19.781
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to
...

01:10:19.781 --> 01:10:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:25.214 --> 01:10:28.050
- Do not say "assholes." This is your voters.

01:10:30.719 --> 01:10:32.721
we are assholes?

01:10:32.971 --> 01:10:37.184
You were not let down. Quentin has an allergy.

01:10:37.643 --> 01:10:40.395
He sleeps in his bedroom. it goes.

01:10:42.022 --> 01:10:43.440
Mom? Pff ...

01:10:44.233 --> 01:10:46.318
Mom, what do you do?

01:10:51.365 --> 01:10:54.243
Mom, you cannot stay like that!

01:10:55.244 --> 01:10:56.829
Let go.

01:10:57.079 --> 01:11:00.040
- I have not been
a good mother to you.

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:03.752
I tried to convey to you
the family values.

01:11:04.002 --> 01:11:07.422
But it could not
work between us.

01:11:07.673 --> 01:11:09.675
I am deaf.

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:12.219
It's my fault.

01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:14.012
I failed everything.

01:11:14.263 --> 01:11:18.392
- You're not a bad mother. You're the perfect mother!

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:24.648
- Why do you want to go to Paris?
- Mom!

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:29.027
- It was for me to go with you
to the end.

01:11:30.529 --> 01:11:32.489
What did I miss?

01:11:32.739 --> 01:11:34.116
- On the contrary!

01:11:34.366 --> 01:11:38.662
It is thanks to you and Dad that I managed to make that choice.

01:11:38.912 --> 01:11:40.706
You gave me the keys.

01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:48.463
- At your birth, when I knew
you were with hearing ...

01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:50.841
Do you remember?

01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:53.093
I cried so much!

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.431
I could never bear
the hearings!

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.394
This is your father who comforted me.

01:12:02.644 --> 01:12:04.855
He told me: "Do not worry.

01:12:05.564 --> 01:12:08.108
"She will be deaf in her head.

01:12:08.734 --> 01:12:11.028
"We will raise her as a deaf.

01:12:12.112 --> 01:12:14.448
"With any luck,
she won't hear anything! "

01:12:17.034 --> 01:12:19.578
And now you sing?

01:12:19.828 --> 01:12:24.458
Luckily you are not
allergic to cow's milk!

01:12:24.958 --> 01:12:25.959
- Okay!

01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:29.087
I have to sell cheese in my life

01:12:29.338 --> 01:12:31.882
because I don't have the chance to be deaf?

01:12:32.132 --> 01:12:33.800
That's what you see

01:12:34.051 --> 01:12:35.844
when you look at me?

01:12:36.094 --> 01:12:38.430
And you don't say anything?

01:12:39.389 --> 01:12:40.682
- What for?

01:12:41.225 --> 01:12:44.436
All right, go .
we will be very well the two of us.

01:12:47.356 --> 01:12:57.355
...

01:13:14.174 --> 01:13:17.761
- Paula? It was not an appointment. Yes ? Well, come on.

01:13:18.011 --> 01:13:20.597
- I stop. - Huh? How?

01:13:20.847 --> 01:13:25.686
- I can not pass the competition in Paris. - Ah. Why this?

01:13:25.936 --> 01:13:28.855
- It's not for me. - Oh! I understand.

01:13:29.106 --> 01:13:33.610
All great artists have that. Nicoletta before a concert,

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.862
she was in a state ...

01:13:37.281 --> 01:13:39.616
- I'm not a great artist.

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:46.039
- No, it's true. You're a little shit.

01:13:49.042 --> 01:13:51.211
- Maybe. I stop. That's it.

01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:54.298
- No no. That's not all, not.

01:13:54.548 --> 01:13:57.926
You think you just stop, but you're digging a hole.

01:13:58.176 --> 01:14:01.722
You lie in it and cover with soil.

01:14:01.972 --> 01:14:06.268
I know him well, this hole. I am in the same cemetery.

01:14:08.437 --> 01:14:11.773
- And then? I do what I want. This is my life.

01:14:12.024 --> 01:14:13.692
- Your life, you are sure?

01:14:15.569 --> 01:14:16.570
- Yes.

01:14:17.529 --> 01:14:19.448
- Think. Please.

01:14:21.241 --> 01:14:22.868
- I stop.

01:14:31.251 --> 01:14:33.670
Loulou, Obama! Mooing.

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.005
Come On!

01:14:35.672 --> 01:14:36.798
Come On.

01:14:37.049 --> 01:14:47.048
...

01:15:16.505 --> 01:15:19.383
- Let's go
for a ride?

01:15:19.633 --> 01:15:20.467
- Where?

01:15:23.136 --> 01:15:24.429
Hairdresser?

01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:25.764
Yeah.

01:15:28.058 --> 01:15:29.935
Yeah, it makes me happy.

01:15:37.734 --> 01:15:39.403
Meuglements.

01:15:39.653 --> 01:15:42.322
...

01:15:42.572 --> 01:15:43.573
Hubbub.

01:15:43.824 --> 01:15:45.992
- Mathilde, you corrected me?

01:15:46.243 --> 01:15:48.412
To walk along the seaside
it's a good idea.

01:15:48.662 --> 01:15:49.704
- Is a good idea.

01:15:49.955 --> 01:15:52.666
- OK. Is a good idea.
- Idea.

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:56.169
- Can I sit? My grandmother sold her car.

01:33:31.599 --> 01:33:33.184
I'm sorry.

01:33:35.269 --> 01:33:36.812
What are you doing?

01:33:37.062 --> 01:33:39.565
Close your eyes. Fly away.

01:33:44.069 --> 01:33:45.279
I will restart from the beginning.

01:33:46.071 --> 01:33:46.989
Sorry.

01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:55.581
When you want, princess.

01:34:00.377 --> 01:34:05.174
- Dear parents, I'm leaving

01:34:05.508 --> 01:34:09.053
I love you, but I'm leaving

01:34:10.095 --> 01:34:13.807
You will not have children tonight

01:34:15.976 --> 01:34:19.980
I do not run, I fly

01:34:20.523 --> 01:34:23.817
Understand, I fly

01:34:24.985 --> 01:34:28.155
Smoke-free, alcohol-free

01:34:28.405 --> 01:34:31.992
I fly, I fly

01:34:33.369 --> 01:34:35.412
She watched me yesterday

01:34:35.663 --> 01:34:40.084
Anxious, confused, my mother as if she felt

01:34:40.334 --> 01:34:42.503
In fact, she suspected

01:34:42.753 --> 01:34:43.837
Heard

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.887
I said that I was Quite serene

01:34:52.137 --> 01:34:54.098
She did not like

01:34:54.348 --> 01:34:56.892
And my father, helpless

01:34:57.142 --> 01:34:58.978
smiles

01:35:00.312 --> 01:35:04.108
Do not turn around

01:35:04.316 --> 01:35:08.112
Out a little more

01:35:08.362 --> 01:35:11.323
There is a station, another station

01:35:11.574 --> 01:35:15.703
And finally, the Atlantic

01:35:18.539 --> 01:35:21.917
My dear parents, I'm leaving

01:35:23.377 --> 01:35:27.548
I love you, but I'm leaving

01:35:28.173 --> 01:35:32.428
You will not have children tonight

01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:37.349
I do not run, I fly

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:41.562
Understand, I fly

01:35:41.812 --> 01:35:44.773
Smoke-free, alcohol-free

01:35:45.024 --> 01:35:47.276
I fly

01:35:47.526 --> 01:35:48.652
I fly

01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:51.697
I wonder in my way

01:35:51.947 --> 01:35:53.824
If my parents suspect

01:35:54.074 --> 01:35:55.826
My tears flowed

01:35:56.076 --> 01:35:59.747
My promises and the desire to move forward

01:36:03.667 --> 01:36:07.755
Only believe in my life See what I promised myself

01:36:08.005 --> 01:36:11.383
Why where and how in this train

01:36:11.634 --> 01:36:14.553
That departs every moment

01:36:16.013 --> 01:36:17.389
It's weird

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:19.600
this cage

01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:22.936
Blocking my chest

01:36:23.854 --> 01:36:26.607
I can not breathe

01:36:26.857 --> 01:36:29.485
it prevents me

01:36:29.735 --> 01:36:32.696
singing

01:36:33.864 --> 01:36:36.992
My dear parents, I'm leaving

01:36:40.329 --> 01:36:42.706
I love you, but I'm leaving

01:36:44.458 --> 01:36:47.795
You have more children

01:36:48.045 --> 01:36:50.047
tonight

01:36:50.673 --> 01:36:53.092
I do not run, I fly

01:36:55.052 --> 01:36:58.514
Understand, I fly

01:36:59.431 --> 01:37:02.434
Smoke-free, alcohol-free

01:37:02.685 --> 01:37:04.812
I fly

01:37:05.062 --> 01:37:06.021
I fly

La, la, la, la,

...

01:40:34.396 --> 01:40:44.478
...

01:40:58.378 --> 01:41:01.256
She runs, she runs

01:41:01.506 --> 01:41:04.468
The disease of love

01:41:04.718 --> 01:41:07.304
In the heart of children

01:41:07.554 --> 01:41:10.682
from 7 to 77 years old

01:41:10.933 --> 01:41:13.894
She sings, she sings

01:41:14.144 --> 01:41:17.064
Insolent River

01:41:17.314 --> 01:41:19.900
Uniting in bed

01:41:20.150 --> 01:41:23.862
Blonde hair, gray hair

01:41:26.156 --> 01:41:28.909
She blackmails men

01:41:29.159 --> 01:41:32.079
And expand the world

01:41:32.329 --> 01:41:34.581
She sometimes suffer

01:41:34.831 --> 01:41:37.960
Throughout a lifetime

01:41:38.210 --> 01:41:41.421
She is crying women

01:41:41.672 --> 01:41:44.675
She is screaming in the background

01:41:44.925 --> 01:41:46.760
But the most painful

01:41:47.010 --> 01:41:50.305
That's when it heals

01:41:50.555 --> 01:41:53.517
She runs, she runs

01:41:53.767 --> 01:41:56.687
