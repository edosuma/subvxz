01:21.823 --> 01:24.337
<i>Born on a mountain top in Tennessee</i>

01:25.223 --> 01:27.942
<i>Greenest state in the land of the free</i>

01:28.463 --> 01:31.216
<i>Raised in the woods so he knew every tree</i>

01:31.823 --> 01:34.462
<i>Killed him a bar when he was only three</i>

01:35.103 --> 01:40.621
<i>Davy, Davy Crockett
king of the wild frontier!</i>

01:44.943 --> 01:47.821
<i>Fought single-handed
through the Injun War</i>

01:48.063 --> 01:51.214
<i>Till the Creeks was whipped
and peace was in store</i>

01:51.623 --> 01:52.692
<i>And while he was handling...</i>

01:53.943 --> 01:54.898
What'd the doctor say?

01:55.023 --> 01:58.902
Nothing. Supposedly it's just
a 24-hour bug. He gave me some pills.

01:59.023 --> 02:01.218
I told you
you probably just ate some bad gristle.

02:01.343 --> 02:02.856
Should we take the short cut
or the scenic route?

02:02.983 --> 02:04.211
Let's take the short cut.

02:04.343 --> 02:05.856
But the scenic route is so much prettier.

02:05.983 --> 02:08.178
- Okay, let's take the scenic route.
- Great.

02:08.303 --> 02:09.702
It's actually slightly quicker anyway.

02:19.663 --> 02:20.937
Thank you.

02:29.463 --> 02:31.021
What is a squab?

02:31.143 --> 02:33.816
You know what it is.
It's like a pigeon I suppose.

02:33.943 --> 02:35.456
Should we go through the hole
under the horse fence,

02:35.583 --> 02:37.062
or climb the rail over the bridle path?

02:37.183 --> 02:39.219
The horse fence is a little safer.

02:39.343 --> 02:42.335
But the bridle path puts us
right next to the squab shack.

02:42.703 --> 02:44.580
Well, okay.

02:45.423 --> 02:47.334
What's wrong? You're acting skittish.

02:47.983 --> 02:51.180
Don't worry. I've been stealing birds
for a living since before I could trot.

02:51.303 --> 02:55.296
You look unbelievably beautiful tonight.
You're practically glowing.

02:55.423 --> 02:56.936
Maybe it's the lighting.

02:58.423 --> 02:59.458
Come on.

03:00.183 --> 03:05.382
<i>I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long long time</i>

03:06.903 --> 03:10.179
<i>Fell in love years ago
with an innocent girl</i>

03:10.303 --> 03:14.979
<i>From the Spanish and Indian home
Home of the heroes and villains</i>

03:20.103 --> 03:25.336
<i>And she was right in the rain of the bullets
that eventually brought her down</i>

03:27.023 --> 03:29.298
<i>But she's still dancing in the night</i>

03:29.423 --> 03:34.099
<i>Unafraid of what a dude'll do
in a town full of heroes and villains</i>

03:35.303 --> 03:36.531
What's that?

03:36.663 --> 03:38.972
- I think it's a fox trap. Look at this.
Get away from there.

03:39.103 --> 03:40.172
Is it spring-loaded?

03:40.303 --> 03:44.615
I guess if you come from over there
and stand at this door to the squab shack,

03:44.743 --> 03:46.301
this little gadget probably triggers...

03:46.423 --> 03:48.220
Move out of the way,
that's where it's going to land.

03:48.343 --> 03:49.696
Don't... Let's go!

03:54.343 --> 03:56.538
No, it just falls straight right down.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.182
It's not spring-loaded.

03:59.303 --> 04:00.372
I'm pregnant.

04:02.863 --> 04:05.582
Wow. We're going to have a cub.

04:06.863 --> 04:07.932
That's great news.

04:08.063 --> 04:09.621
If we're still alive...

04:13.263 --> 04:17.779
If we're still alive tomorrow morning,
I want you to find another line of work.

04:19.183 --> 04:20.332
Okay.

04:22.543 --> 04:23.896
<i>My children were raised</i>

04:24.023 --> 04:28.221
<i>You know they suddenly rise
They started so long ago</i>

04:28.423 --> 04:32.416
<i>Head to toe healthy, wealthy and wise</i>

04:45.343 --> 04:48.335
Does anybody actually read my column?
Do your friends talk about it?

04:48.463 --> 04:51.739
Of course. In fact,
Rabbit's ex-girlfriend said to me,

04:51.863 --> 04:54.331
<i>"I should read Foxy's column. "
But they don't get the Gazette.</i>

04:54.463 --> 04:55.816
Ash! Let's get cracking.

04:55.943 --> 04:57.456
Why would they? It's a rag sheet.

04:57.583 --> 04:58.777
- I'm sick.
- You're not.

04:58.903 --> 05:00.621
- I have a temperature.
- You don't.

05:00.743 --> 05:03.052
- I don't want to go.
- Hurry up. You'll be late.

05:03.183 --> 05:05.060
I love the way you handled that.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.938
Your cousin Kristofferson's
coming on the 6th.

05:12.063 --> 05:15.738
Be extra nice to him,
he's going through a hard time right now.

05:15.863 --> 05:18.093
- Where will he sleep?
- In your room.

05:18.223 --> 05:20.293
I can't spare the space.
Put him in Dad's study.

05:20.423 --> 05:22.937
Dad's study is occupied by Dad.

05:25.663 --> 05:28.860
I don't want to live in a hole anymore.
It makes me feel poor.

05:28.983 --> 05:31.577
We are poor. But we're happy.

05:31.703 --> 05:35.298
<i>Comme ci, comme Ã§a. Anyway,
the views are better above ground.</i>

05:37.423 --> 05:40.733
Honey, I'm 7 non-fox-years old.
My father died at 7-1/2.

05:40.863 --> 05:44.822
I don't want to live in a hole anymore.
I'm going to do something about it.

05:52.663 --> 05:55.700
Well, I'm off. Have a good day, my darlings.

05:56.583 --> 05:59.859
You know, foxes live in holes for a reason.

06:01.503 --> 06:02.856
Yes and no.

06:06.103 --> 06:09.891
What are you wearing? Why a cape
with the pants tucked in your socks?

06:14.223 --> 06:15.941
I guess he's just

06:17.263 --> 06:18.218
different.

06:21.063 --> 06:22.178
I'm not the listing agent on it,

06:22.303 --> 06:25.056
so it doesn't matter to me. I know he's...

06:25.343 --> 06:28.858
Actually, there he is. Mr. Fox! Here it is!

06:28.983 --> 06:32.578
This is the tree! Come on over.
I'll call you back, Bob.

06:33.783 --> 06:36.820
Obviously, it's first growth, indigenous,
original dirt floor.

06:36.943 --> 06:39.537
Good bark, skipping stone hearth,
as you can see.

06:40.743 --> 06:42.142
Kylie. Kylie!

06:42.263 --> 06:44.618
I'm showing the property.
You're not supposed to be here.

06:44.743 --> 06:45.971
What time is it? Sorry.

06:46.103 --> 06:49.015
This is Kylie, the super. He's a little...

06:49.143 --> 06:51.134
What's in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?

06:51.263 --> 06:53.982
See what his eyes look like?
Hey, Kylie!

06:54.103 --> 06:56.856
Huh? Just minnows. Want to try one?

06:56.983 --> 06:58.496
Certainly. Thank you.

07:00.663 --> 07:04.895
It's not exactly an evergreen, is it?
Are there any pines on the market?

07:05.023 --> 07:07.696
Pines are hard to come by
in your price range.

07:07.823 --> 07:09.051
What's that?

07:19.423 --> 07:21.857
What do you do for a living, Mr. Fox?

07:21.983 --> 07:24.702
I used to steal birds,
but now I'm a newspaperman.

07:24.823 --> 07:27.053
Oh, sure. I've seen your byline.

07:28.943 --> 07:30.979
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- You're going?

07:31.103 --> 07:35.301
Oh, and Kylie, thank you for the minnow.
It was superb.

07:43.543 --> 07:45.135
Don't buy this tree, Foxy.

07:45.263 --> 07:47.333
You're borrowing at 9.5%
with no fixed rate,

07:47.463 --> 07:49.693
plus moving into the most dangerous
neighborhood in the country

07:49.823 --> 07:51.336
for your species.

07:51.463 --> 07:52.862
You're exaggerating.

07:54.103 --> 07:57.300
I'm sugar-coating it.
This is Boggis, Bunce and Bean,

07:57.423 --> 08:01.052
three of the meanest, nastiest,
ugliest farmers in the history of this valley.

08:01.183 --> 08:02.821
Really? Tell me about them.

08:04.543 --> 08:05.578
All right.

08:05.983 --> 08:09.293
<i>BADGER.W alt Boggis is a chicken farmer.
Probably the most successful in the world.</i>

08:09.423 --> 08:11.891
<i>He weighs the same as a young rhinoceros.</i>

08:12.023 --> 08:15.902
<i>He eats three chickens every day
for breakfast, lunch, supper and dessert.</i>

08:16.023 --> 08:17.979
<i>That's twelve in total per diem.</i>

08:18.103 --> 08:20.059
<i>Nate Bunce is a duck and goose farmer.</i>

08:20.183 --> 08:22.617
<i>He's approximately the size
of a pot-bellied dwarf,</i>

08:22.743 --> 08:23.937
<i>and his chin would be underwater</i>

08:24.063 --> 08:26.418
<i>in the shallow end of any swimming pool
on the planet.</i>

08:26.543 --> 08:28.056
<i>His food is homemade donuts</i>

08:28.183 --> 08:30.743
<i>with smashed-up goose livers
injected into them.</i>

08:30.983 --> 08:33.371
<i>Frank Bean is a turkey and apple farmer.</i>

08:33.503 --> 08:35.573
<i>He invented his own species of each.</i>

08:35.863 --> 08:40.618
<i>He lives on a liquid diet of strong alcoholic
cider, which he makes from his apples.</i>

08:42.023 --> 08:44.139
<i>He's skinny as a pencil, smart as a whip,</i>

08:44.263 --> 08:46.902
<i>and possibly the scariest man
currently living.</i>

08:49.383 --> 08:53.820
The local human children sing
a kind of eerie little rhyme about him.

08:53.943 --> 08:55.695
Here, listen to this.

08:55.823 --> 08:57.336
<i>Boggis, Bunce and Bean</i>

08:57.463 --> 08:59.579
<i>One fat, one short, one lean</i>

08:59.703 --> 09:01.614
<i>These horrible crooks
So different in looks</i>

09:01.743 --> 09:03.734
<i>Were nonetheless equally mean</i>

09:04.783 --> 09:08.332
In summation, I think
you just got to not do it. That's all.

09:08.823 --> 09:12.133
I understand what you're saying,
and your comments are valuable,

09:12.263 --> 09:14.618
but I'm going to ignore your advice.

09:14.823 --> 09:16.222
The cuss you are.

09:17.983 --> 09:20.781
The cuss am I? Are you cussing with me?

09:20.903 --> 09:22.700
- Are you cussing with me?
- Don't cussing point at me.

09:22.823 --> 09:26.099
Don't cuss with someone
you're not going to cuss with.

09:34.463 --> 09:36.499
- Just buy the tree.
- Okay.

09:36.943 --> 09:39.980
Take a left, then to the right.
Set them down. Help that other guy.

09:40.103 --> 09:43.379
Lift with your legs, not your back.
Don't try to be a superman.

09:43.663 --> 09:47.292
We got two circuits here,
yellow and green. Keep them separated.

09:47.423 --> 09:50.335
We need to bring about 2% more in.

09:50.463 --> 09:52.897
A little bit more, a little bit more.
Looks good.

09:53.223 --> 09:56.340
Get that bottom structure settled in.
Bring in the side unit.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.899
Be careful of the branches, guys.
Don't peel away the bark.

10:04.423 --> 10:05.412
Wow.

10:06.663 --> 10:07.812
Hi.

10:28.743 --> 10:30.813
He's slightly younger,
but a cuss of a lot bigger.

10:30.943 --> 10:34.413
That's just genetics, I guess.
Ash has a littler body type.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.179
Go.

10:43.023 --> 10:44.172
Watch this, Dad!

10:46.423 --> 10:47.742
Well, well.

10:48.303 --> 10:50.419
Good jump, Ash.
Remember to keep your tail tucked.

10:53.823 --> 10:55.973
Still painting thunderstorms, I see.

10:56.103 --> 10:57.855
Do you still feel poor?

10:59.463 --> 11:00.612
Less so.

11:12.743 --> 11:15.701
Look at that! This kid's a natural.
I'm speechless, Kristofferson.

11:24.023 --> 11:25.741
Plus, he knows karate.

11:31.263 --> 11:33.857
- Do you think I'm an athlete?
- What are you talking about?

11:33.983 --> 11:35.860
Well, I think I'm an athlete.

11:35.983 --> 11:39.055
Sometimes I feel like you guys
don't see me that way.

11:39.183 --> 11:41.777
What's the subtext here? Is he praying?

11:42.143 --> 11:43.815
I think that's yoga.

11:46.903 --> 11:49.098
How long is Kristofferson
supposed to stay with us?

11:49.223 --> 11:50.702
Until your uncle gets better.

11:50.823 --> 11:53.212
But roughly how long do we plan
to give him on that?

11:53.343 --> 11:56.255
Double pneumonia. It's not that big a deal.

11:56.663 --> 11:58.176
Lower your voice, Ash.

12:07.103 --> 12:08.616
Who am I, Kylie?

12:09.183 --> 12:10.662
Who how? What now?

12:10.783 --> 12:14.492
Why a fox? Why not a horse,
a beetle or a bald eagle?

12:14.623 --> 12:17.456
I'm saying this more as existentialism.

12:17.583 --> 12:20.017
Who am I,
and how can a fox ever be happy

12:20.143 --> 12:23.453
without, forgive the expression,
a chicken in its teeth?

12:24.223 --> 12:26.657
I don't know what you're talking about,
but it sounds illegal.

12:26.783 --> 12:28.774
Here, put this bandit hat on.

12:29.903 --> 12:32.656
Maybe you're a medium. Take it off
and don't wear it around the house.

12:34.383 --> 12:35.862
And so it begins.

12:38.223 --> 12:40.976
Do you mind if I slide my bedroll
slightly out from under the train set?

12:41.103 --> 12:43.458
It's hard to sleep
in that corkscrew position.

12:43.583 --> 12:48.703
There's a lot of attitudes going on
around here. Don't let me get one.

12:48.823 --> 12:50.336
It's just that my spinal cord is...

12:50.463 --> 12:51.578
Sleep wherever you want.

12:51.703 --> 12:55.457
Here, take my bed.
I'll crawl under the bookcase.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.699
Who cares if I get splinters in my ears?

12:57.823 --> 12:59.415
- Never mind.
- Are you going to pout about it?

12:59.543 --> 13:02.899
I've had it up to here
with the sad house guest routine.

13:10.383 --> 13:11.611
Good night.

14:06.503 --> 14:09.495
I used to do this professionally
and I was very successful at it.

14:09.623 --> 14:10.851
I had to get out of it for personal reasons,

14:10.983 --> 14:14.737
but I've decided to secretly do
one last big job on the sly.

14:14.863 --> 14:17.582
I'm bringing you in as my secretary
and personal assistant.

14:17.703 --> 14:18.738
Okay.

14:19.383 --> 14:22.181
This is actually kind of a big deal,
so don't just say, "Okay. "

14:22.303 --> 14:23.292
Okay, thank you.

14:23.423 --> 14:26.699
I'm going to tape this for my records,
so don't make a lot of sounds.

14:26.823 --> 14:28.575
Meaning, stop rocking.

14:29.623 --> 14:31.454
Master Plan. Phase one. Side A.

14:32.023 --> 14:34.014
We'll start with
Boggis' Chicken House Number One.

14:34.143 --> 14:37.215
His only security is a few old
hunting beagles and a low stone wall.

14:37.343 --> 14:40.733
A word about beagles,
never look a beagle directly in the eye.

14:40.983 --> 14:43.372
Why not? Beagles aren't so tough.

14:44.063 --> 14:47.942
One of these beagles has chronic rabies,
which he's on medication for.

14:48.063 --> 14:51.578
If you get bitten by him, you have to get
shots in your stomach for six months.

14:51.703 --> 14:52.897
I'm not going to justify this.

14:53.023 --> 14:55.583
Just pay attention and stop interrupting.
I'm taping this.

14:55.703 --> 14:57.534
I picked some blueberries and laced each

14:57.663 --> 14:59.733
with 10 mg of high potency
sleeping powder.

14:59.863 --> 15:01.057
Enough to tranquilize a gorilla.

15:01.423 --> 15:04.096
- How do we make them eat it?
- Beagles love blueberries.

15:04.223 --> 15:07.260
<i>Remember, they aren't very
smart, but they're incredibly paranoid,</i>

15:07.383 --> 15:09.499
<i>so always kill a chicken in one bite.</i>

15:10.183 --> 15:11.696
One bite, get it?

15:13.423 --> 15:14.981
Are you listening to me?
I look in your eyes

15:15.103 --> 15:16.741
and can't tell if you get anything I say.

15:21.223 --> 15:22.451
Magnesium.

15:23.663 --> 15:25.221
- Magnesium!
- Sorry.

15:27.063 --> 15:28.052
Pipette.

15:28.183 --> 15:29.821
- Pipette!
- Oh, sorry.

15:30.703 --> 15:32.978
Potassium... What are you looking at?

15:33.103 --> 15:34.218
Oh, no.

15:36.263 --> 15:38.254
Why's your cousin such a wet sandwich?

15:38.383 --> 15:39.862
- I beg your pardon?
- What's that mean?

15:39.983 --> 15:42.019
That means I didn't understand,
a wet sandwich?

15:42.143 --> 15:45.374
A wet sandwich, he's too short,
he dresses like a girl, he's

15:45.743 --> 15:46.698
different.

15:46.823 --> 15:49.496
Are you a bully?
You're starting to sound like a bully.

15:50.023 --> 15:51.138
Watch this.

15:53.063 --> 15:54.621
You just destroyed the whole experiment.

15:54.743 --> 15:57.257
We better extinguish this magnesium.
Stand back.

16:03.903 --> 16:05.416
I like your ears.

16:05.703 --> 16:06.738
Mine?

16:06.863 --> 16:09.536
Mmm-hmm.
- Thank you. I like your spots.

16:09.663 --> 16:12.735
Really? I used to cover them up,
but, you know...

16:14.143 --> 16:16.976
- You're supposed to be my lab partner.
- I am.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.738
No, you're not. You're disloyal.

16:40.143 --> 16:42.896
A few beagles, as we discussed,
but we're ready for that.

16:44.063 --> 16:47.772
In the old days, didn't we do a thing
when somebody saw a wolf...

16:47.903 --> 16:49.416
Wolf? What wolf?

16:51.783 --> 16:53.375
Nothing? Never mind.

16:54.623 --> 16:57.012
Here comes a little stone wall.
Not a problem.

17:00.943 --> 17:03.741
What the cuss? Where did this giant fence
come from? We had a master plan.

17:03.863 --> 17:04.852
What's this lightning bolt?

17:06.262 --> 17:09.221
It could mean the fence might be electric.

17:09.343 --> 17:12.493
I hope it doesn't mean thunder,
because I have a phobia of that.

17:12.623 --> 17:13.817
Ah!

17:22.303 --> 17:23.577
Watch this.

17:46.703 --> 17:49.854
Beagles love blueberries. Didn't I tell you?
The master plan is working again.

17:50.983 --> 17:52.382
This is the tricky part.

17:52.503 --> 17:54.175
One of us has to jump the barbed wire,

17:54.303 --> 17:56.737
slide under the tire spikes
and open the fence latch.

17:56.863 --> 17:58.501
- Who will it be?
- Not me.

17:58.623 --> 18:01.979
Kristofferson could do this easily.
He's like an Olympic level...

18:02.103 --> 18:04.412
Why don't we run that way?
There's no obstacles.

18:05.863 --> 18:06.978
Yeah, that's better.

18:17.223 --> 18:18.576
- I said, one bite.
- I'm trying!

18:18.703 --> 18:21.376
I have a different kind of teeth from you.
I'm an opossum.

18:21.823 --> 18:22.812
Give me that.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.655
That's so grisly. There's blood.

18:26.783 --> 18:27.932
Follow me.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.539
All right, what's the master escape plan?

18:48.623 --> 18:49.772
Follow me again.

18:55.783 --> 18:56.738
Quick!

18:58.703 --> 18:59.931
Give me that!

19:10.383 --> 19:12.453
Let's hit the five-and-dime
on the way home.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.972
We'll make fake price tags
and wrap the chickens in wax paper,

19:15.103 --> 19:16.855
so it looks like we bought them!

19:23.183 --> 19:24.218
Huh!

19:26.183 --> 19:27.616
Where'd you get this chicken?

19:27.743 --> 19:30.098
At the five-and-dime last night.

19:30.223 --> 19:32.896
It has a Boggis Farms tag around its ankle.

19:33.023 --> 19:36.174
Huh! Must have escaped from there
before I bought it.

19:42.383 --> 19:43.338
Psst!

19:43.783 --> 19:46.502
Bunce tonight. He has a refrigerated
smokehouse with geese...

19:46.623 --> 19:50.332
I thought you said
we were only doing one last big job.

19:50.463 --> 19:53.773
We are. But it's not done yet.
It's a triple-header.

20:24.623 --> 20:25.692
Shh! Shh!

20:29.663 --> 20:30.618
Huh.

20:31.103 --> 20:32.377
Let's see some hustle.

20:32.503 --> 20:34.733
I've never played whack-bat.
What are the rules?

20:34.863 --> 20:36.819
No whack-bat on the other side
of the river?

20:36.943 --> 20:40.094
No, we mostly just run grass sprints
or play acorns.

20:40.623 --> 20:42.056
It's real simple.

20:42.183 --> 20:45.698
<i>There's 3 grabbers, 3 taggers,
5 twig-runners and the player at whack-bat.</i>

20:45.823 --> 20:48.098
<i>The center-tagger lights a pinecone
and chucks it over the basket.</i>

20:48.223 --> 20:50.657
<i>The whack-batter tries to hit
the cedar-stick off the cross-rock.</i>

20:50.783 --> 20:52.216
<i>The twig-runners dash back and forth</i>

20:52.343 --> 20:54.538
<i>until the pinecone burns out
and the umpire calls, "hot box. "</i>

20:54.903 --> 20:57.212
At the end, you count
how many score-downs it adds up to

20:57.343 --> 20:58.298
and divide by nine.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.742
- Got it.
- Go in for Ash.

20:59.863 --> 21:02.980
Substitution! Ash, come out!
You need a breather.

21:03.103 --> 21:04.502
Come out?

21:04.623 --> 21:07.581
What? I still feel good, Coach.
Let me finish this 8th.

21:07.703 --> 21:10.501
No, come on. Step out, let's go.

21:12.783 --> 21:16.458
- Am I getting better, Coach?
- You're sure as cuss not getting worse.

21:16.583 --> 21:20.337
You think I could end up being as good
as my dad if I keep practicing?

21:20.463 --> 21:23.933
Your dad? Your dad was probably
the best whack-bat player

21:24.063 --> 21:25.860
we ever had in this school.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.738
Don't compare yourself to that.

21:32.863 --> 21:36.936
But I think I have some of the same
raw natural talent, don't you?

21:37.303 --> 21:39.942
You're improving, let's put it like that.

22:04.463 --> 22:05.418
Hot box!

22:05.543 --> 22:07.022
Divide that by nine, please!

22:08.543 --> 22:11.137
That's the first time
this kid's ever swung a whack bat?

22:11.263 --> 22:13.413
He really is your father's nephew.

22:13.543 --> 22:15.022
- Not by blood.
- No?

22:15.143 --> 22:17.577
- He's from my mother's side.
- Oh, yeah.

22:18.943 --> 22:20.661
What's that stand for?

22:21.583 --> 22:23.858
It's for pep. Pep.

22:23.983 --> 22:24.938
It's a K.

22:25.063 --> 22:27.418
Come on now, look alive! That-a-boy!

22:28.263 --> 22:29.378
We're going steady.

22:34.063 --> 22:35.018
What's that?

22:35.143 --> 22:36.861
What? What, this?

22:37.343 --> 22:40.494
Nothing. Just some old trophy I won
for being an athlete.

22:42.103 --> 22:44.412
I have to cover a book party
at some animalâs nest

22:44.543 --> 22:45.942
in a tobacco field down the hill.

22:46.063 --> 22:49.453
Kylie and I are going to give it a whirl.
Don't wait up.

22:49.583 --> 22:51.062
What's the book?

22:51.303 --> 22:54.056
Some memoir.
I'll get him to sign you a copy.

22:54.183 --> 22:56.299
The dinner was pitch perfect.

23:03.503 --> 23:07.291
I saw a couple broken burglar bars under
the back door to Bean's secret cider cellar.

23:07.423 --> 23:09.220
- We're breaking into Bean's house?
- Cellar.

23:09.343 --> 23:11.095
- Where he lives?
- Where he keeps the cider.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.576
Below where he lives.

23:12.703 --> 23:14.580
Where'd you come from? Go back
to the tree and do your homework.

23:14.703 --> 23:16.022
I want to help steal cider.

23:16.143 --> 23:18.657
We're going to a book party.
And be quiet about any cider,

23:18.783 --> 23:20.739
because nobody said that. Now, go!

23:20.863 --> 23:23.138
You're going to get me in a lot of trouble.

23:23.263 --> 23:25.299
Besides, you're too little
and uncoordinated.

23:27.863 --> 23:29.091
One, two, three!

23:31.063 --> 23:32.735
Where the cuss does that kid get off?

23:32.863 --> 23:34.660
Can you believe that?
How'd he get tipped off?

23:37.983 --> 23:39.018
You think he'll tell on us?

23:40.903 --> 23:43.292
Before we go on,
can you give me some kind of signal

23:43.423 --> 23:45.379
so I know this is getting through to you?

23:48.103 --> 23:49.536
That's it? All right.

23:49.663 --> 23:50.982
There's another one.

23:51.423 --> 23:53.983
- Good, you made it. Anybody see you?
- I don't think so.

23:54.103 --> 23:55.661
Put this bandit hat on.

23:57.583 --> 24:00.734
I'm pleased to be invited,
but I'm not sure I should be doing this.

24:00.863 --> 24:03.138
- Why not?
- I don't like to be dishonest with people.

24:03.263 --> 24:05.060
Just keep your mouth shut
and it won't be a problem.

24:05.183 --> 24:07.458
- I don't think he should come, either.
- We're not taking a vote!

24:10.543 --> 24:11.737
One time, this wolf I saw...

24:11.863 --> 24:14.661
What's with all the wolf talk?
Give it a rest for once.

24:26.903 --> 24:28.700
Look at all this apple juice.

24:28.823 --> 24:32.020
Apple juice?
We didn't come here for apple juice.

24:32.143 --> 24:35.772
This is some of the strongest,
finest alcoholic cider money can buy

24:35.903 --> 24:37.734
or that can even be stolen.

24:37.863 --> 24:40.252
It burns in your throat,
boils in your stomach,

24:40.383 --> 24:43.375
and tastes almost exactly
like pure, melted gold.

24:52.583 --> 24:56.178
Y'all are trespassing now, illegally.

25:01.943 --> 25:05.856
'Round these parts,
we don't take kindly to cider poachers.

25:06.343 --> 25:07.662
You've aged badly, Rat.

25:08.343 --> 25:11.779
You're getting a little long in the tooth
yourself, partner.

25:14.903 --> 25:17.576
Why are you wearing that badge?
What is that?

25:19.103 --> 25:20.741
It's my job.

25:35.183 --> 25:37.060
How's your old lady doing?

25:37.183 --> 25:38.980
Do you refer to my wife?

25:40.063 --> 25:42.338
She was the town tart in her day.

25:42.463 --> 25:44.260
Wild and footloose and

25:45.263 --> 25:46.537
pretty as a mink stole.

25:46.903 --> 25:47.938
Is that true?

25:48.743 --> 25:51.815
Of course not. I mean,
certainly she lived. We all did.

25:51.943 --> 25:54.821
It was a different time.
Let's not use a double standard.

25:54.943 --> 25:56.535
- But town tart?
- Shut up.

25:58.863 --> 26:00.535
That was close, Rat. Be careful.

26:01.103 --> 26:03.094
Oh, I'm careful as a...

26:27.943 --> 26:30.252
How many jars should I bring up, Franklin?

26:30.383 --> 26:32.055
I don't know. Two, I guess.

26:32.183 --> 26:34.060
You drank three yesterday.

26:34.423 --> 26:36.175
All right. Take three.

26:46.943 --> 26:48.581
Nope. Two is plenty.

26:53.023 --> 26:55.617
Oh, my cuss. Is she blind?

26:55.743 --> 26:58.974
She might have astigmatism
or possibly a cataract of some form.

26:59.103 --> 27:00.582
Anyway, her eyes don't see well.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.613
What'd I tell you?
This kid's a natural! Am I right?

27:22.063 --> 27:24.975
So good of you to come.
You both look splendid.

27:25.103 --> 27:27.094
How have you been, Walter?
In good health?

27:28.023 --> 27:29.536
Nathan? AII's well?

27:29.663 --> 27:30.857
Wonderful.

27:32.423 --> 27:33.936
Any fox problems?

27:34.543 --> 27:35.532
- Are you joking?
- Horrible.

27:35.663 --> 27:36.618
- We're miserable.
- He's laughing at us.

27:36.743 --> 27:37.732
- Humiliating.
- We're furious.

27:37.863 --> 27:38.852
I don't want to talk about it.

27:46.383 --> 27:47.862
Perhaps we ought to kill him.

27:49.183 --> 27:51.299
- That seems obvious.
- He's too sneaky.

27:51.663 --> 27:54.894
Right, of course. 
He's very clever, isn't he?

27:55.023 --> 27:57.412
Might be a bit difficult, I suppose.

28:06.583 --> 28:09.814
I've figured out where this fox lives.
Tomorrow night, we'll camp in the bushes,

28:09.943 --> 28:13.299
wait for him to come out
and shoot the cuss to smithereens.

28:13.423 --> 28:15.095
How does that grab you?

28:15.783 --> 28:17.375
I don't see why not.

28:28.503 --> 28:30.141
Another book party?

28:31.903 --> 28:34.861
I didn't see you sitting in the dark
over there.

28:35.703 --> 28:38.501
Actually, there was a fire.
I just got the call.

28:38.623 --> 28:41.421
May be arson.
I have to interview the marshal...

28:41.543 --> 28:44.103
Kylie. Is he telling the truth?

28:45.503 --> 28:46.822
I don't want to be put 
in the middle of this.

28:46.943 --> 28:47.932
Thanks, Kylie.

28:48.063 --> 28:50.258
Why is he wearing that bandit hat?

28:53.303 --> 28:55.863
His ears were cold. He's not with us.
Go back to bed.

28:57.583 --> 29:00.256
If what I think is happening is happening,

29:01.103 --> 29:02.252
it better not be.

29:19.343 --> 29:20.901
Nice job covering for me. Next time...

29:35.503 --> 29:36.458
All three!

29:36.783 --> 29:37.772
Kill him!

30:00.263 --> 30:02.333
We got the tail, but we missed the fox.

30:04.943 --> 30:08.253
Petey, sorry to wake you.
Can you dash out here right away

30:08.383 --> 30:12.342
with three shovels, two pickaxes,
500 rounds of ammunition,

30:12.943 --> 30:14.217
and a bottle of apple cider?

30:15.903 --> 30:18.497
It'll grow back, won't it?
- Tails don't grow back.

30:18.623 --> 30:20.739
- Tails don't grow back?
- Mmm-mmm. Except lizards'.

30:20.863 --> 30:24.412
Tails don't grow back. I'm gonna be
tail-less for the rest of my life.

30:24.543 --> 30:27.137
Anyway, it's not half as bad
as double pneumonia, right?

30:27.263 --> 30:30.175
I mean, his dad has one foot in the grave
and three feet on a banana peel.

30:30.303 --> 30:32.021
That's a lot worse than...

30:35.023 --> 30:37.332
Excuse me. I'm going to go meditate
for half an hour.

30:38.863 --> 30:41.741
You have 29 minutes
to come up with a proper apology.

30:41.863 --> 30:43.899
Me? Me have an apology?

30:44.423 --> 30:47.620
He just got here and got a bandit hat?
Where's my bandit hat?

30:47.743 --> 30:51.861
Why didn't I get shot at? Because
you think I'm no good at anything!

30:51.983 --> 30:53.735
Maybe you're right, thanks.

30:56.343 --> 30:57.856
I told you not to bring him.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.414
Why the cuss
didn't I listen to my lawyer?

31:00.543 --> 31:04.536
We'll be lucky to flip this tree
for half of what we've sunk into it.

31:04.663 --> 31:08.861
I can't sleep on my back for 6 weeks
and on my stomach, I feel congested.

31:08.983 --> 31:10.894
Why the cuss didn't I listen to my lawyer?

31:11.023 --> 31:12.934
Because you
don't listen to anybody.

31:14.623 --> 31:15.612
- What was that?
I said...

31:16.823 --> 31:18.302
Wake up! They're digging us out!

31:18.463 --> 31:20.852
- They'll kill the children.
- Over my dead body.

31:20.983 --> 31:23.975
- I know. You're dead, too, in that scenario.
- I'm arguing against that.

31:24.103 --> 31:25.377
- What?
- Why are you yelling?

31:25.503 --> 31:29.655
Stop! You say one thing, she says another,
and it all changes back again!

31:39.903 --> 31:42.497
I've got it. No time to lose.
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

31:42.623 --> 31:43.942
Think of what?

31:44.063 --> 31:45.621
We've been trapped before.

31:46.023 --> 31:48.218
Dig!

32:07.183 --> 32:10.778
I think it's time for me to give a pep talk
and explain some things.

32:11.503 --> 32:12.458
A very long time ago...

32:12.583 --> 32:14.574
May I have a word with you privately?

32:14.703 --> 32:16.216
Well, we're in a hole here.

32:16.343 --> 32:19.494
On the other side of this mineral deposit.
Follow me.

32:22.383 --> 32:24.738
I'm going
to lose my temper now.

32:25.463 --> 32:26.737
- When?
- Right now.

32:27.503 --> 32:28.492
Well, when?

32:32.503 --> 32:35.495
Twelve fox-years ago,
you made a promise

32:35.623 --> 32:38.376
while we were caged in that fox trap
that, if we survived,

32:38.503 --> 32:41.301
you would never steal another chicken,
turkey, goose, duck

32:41.423 --> 32:42.822
or squab, whatever they are.

32:42.943 --> 32:46.492
Now, I believed you.
Why did you lie to me?

32:48.223 --> 32:50.020
Because I'm a wild animal.

32:50.383 --> 32:52.943
You are also a husband, and a father!

32:53.983 --> 32:55.939
I'm trying to tell you the truth
about myself.

32:56.583 --> 32:59.177
I don't care about the truth about yourself.

32:59.823 --> 33:02.496
This story is too predictable.

33:03.183 --> 33:06.095
Predictable, really?
What happens in the end?

33:06.863 --> 33:09.297
In the end, we all die.

33:10.503 --> 33:12.095
Unless you change.

33:26.943 --> 33:30.777
Petey, run down to the rental department
at Malloy Consolidated and place an order

33:30.903 --> 33:34.657
for one Mighty Max, one Junior Spitfire,

33:34.783 --> 33:38.492
and a long-range Tornado 375 Turbo.
For immediate delivery.

33:46.703 --> 33:47.692
Huh?

33:47.823 --> 33:49.222
- Huh?
- Huh?

33:58.023 --> 34:01.379
<i>Everywhere I hear the sound</i>

34:01.503 --> 34:05.815
<i>of marching charging feet, boy</i>

34:06.743 --> 34:10.338
<i>Cause summer's here and the time is right</i>

34:10.463 --> 34:14.853
<i>For fighting in the streets, boy</i>

34:15.902 --> 34:19.179
Ash, are you mad at me?
I understand if you are, and I'm sorry.

34:19.303 --> 34:22.261
I wouldn't have involved your cousin
if I'd realized you'd feel this way.

34:22.382 --> 34:26.501
It was only ever because he kind of
a natural, I mean... Look at him dig!

34:29.303 --> 34:30.577
Anyway, I'm sorry if...

34:30.703 --> 34:32.773
I'm going to just put dirt in my ears.

34:32.902 --> 34:34.699
That's better. I can't hear you now,
but keep talking.

34:35.663 --> 34:36.572
<i>Get down</i>

34:56.503 --> 34:58.300
I don't have beagle ticks, by the way.

34:58.423 --> 35:02.860
Well, me, neither. Whoever
said we had beagle ticks, by the way?

35:02.983 --> 35:06.180
Apparently, that's what you've been
telling everyone. Beagle ticks and pelt lice.

35:06.303 --> 35:10.740
I never said that. And you're misquoting
me. But I'll get to the bottom of it.

35:11.583 --> 35:13.733
We may or may not ever see
the light of day again,

35:13.863 --> 35:16.331
but I really like Agnes
and I think she likes me.

35:16.783 --> 35:18.660
Great. She's a free agent. What do I care?

35:18.783 --> 35:20.057
Then why are you dead set...

35:20.183 --> 35:22.378
- Can I ask you a question?
- You may.

35:22.503 --> 35:25.097
What's the point of sitting on the floor
with your legs twisted into a pretzel

35:25.223 --> 35:27.896
talking to yourself
for an hour and 45 minutes? It's weird.

35:28.023 --> 35:30.856
My father and I started meditating
together when...

35:30.983 --> 35:34.259
That's great, but I'd worry more about
what that does to your reputation

35:34.383 --> 35:36.578
than whether you have beagle ticks or not.

35:38.023 --> 35:39.934
I don't. Nor pelt lice.

35:43.383 --> 35:47.740
One of those slovenly farmers is probably
wearing my tail as a necktie by now.

35:47.863 --> 35:49.012
You're paranoid, Foxy.

35:49.423 --> 35:52.142
<i>Farmer, correct me
if I'm misreading the data.</i>

35:52.263 --> 35:55.255
<i>You've destroyed the scenery,
but the alleged fox remains at large.</i>

35:55.383 --> 35:57.055
Look at Dad's tie.

35:57.183 --> 35:59.299
<i>What will you three prominent farmers
do now?</i>

35:59.423 --> 36:01.698
<i>I can tell you what we're not going to do.</i>

36:01.823 --> 36:03.495
<i>We're not going to let him go.</i>

36:15.303 --> 36:17.373
Stand clear, please. Stand clear, everyone.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.252
Contact!

36:32.783 --> 36:34.580
Boggis, how many men work
on your farm?

36:34.703 --> 36:35.692
-35.
- Bunce?

36:35.823 --> 36:36.858
-36.
- I've got 37.

36:36.983 --> 36:39.656
That... Carry the zero, divide by two...

36:39.783 --> 36:41.421
That's 108 all together.

36:42.863 --> 36:45.696
Petey, drop everything
and assemble all 108 members

36:45.823 --> 36:47.779
of our three combined work forces.

36:47.903 --> 36:50.861
We'll starve them out, then kill them.
Starting in

36:51.543 --> 36:53.534
shall we say, 15 minutes?

36:55.023 --> 36:58.060
An estimated
108 snipers are in position,

36:58.183 --> 37:00.617
surrounding the demolished fox residence.

37:00.743 --> 37:03.541
Any local animals appear to be
trapped underground

37:03.663 --> 37:05.654
without provisions of any kind.

37:05.783 --> 37:10.174
If I had a crystal ball, I'd predict
a fairly grisly outcome to this situation.

37:10.303 --> 37:14.501
We'll stay on the scene, watching closely,
as events continue to unfold.

37:15.543 --> 37:19.456
This is going to be a total cluster-cuss
for everybody.

37:26.143 --> 37:28.259
How long can a fox go
without food or water?

37:29.063 --> 37:32.578
I can only answer as an opossum, but I
can't last more than another couple hours

37:32.703 --> 37:34.898
before I get completely dehydrated
and starve to death.

37:35.023 --> 37:36.138
What's that?

37:43.503 --> 37:45.061
Dad.
Not a sound.

37:54.303 --> 37:55.975
You scared the cuss out of us!

37:58.503 --> 38:02.291
A lot of good animals are probably going
to die, because of you!

38:04.903 --> 38:06.939
We've been digging in circles for 3 days.

38:07.063 --> 38:08.291
Half the woods have been obliterated.

38:08.423 --> 38:11.699
Nobody can get out. My wife's huddled
at the bottom of a flint-mine

38:11.823 --> 38:15.259
with no food, no water,
and 27 starving animal brats!

38:16.463 --> 38:19.694
I just want to see a little sunshine.

38:19.943 --> 38:23.140
You're nocturnal, Phil. Your eyes
barely even open on a good day.

38:23.263 --> 38:25.219
I'm sick of your double-talk!
We have rights!

38:25.903 --> 38:27.621
We don't like you and we hate your dad.

38:27.743 --> 38:30.177
Now grab some mud,
chew it and swallow it.

38:30.303 --> 38:32.692
- I'm not going to eat mud.
- Cuss, yeah, you are.

38:40.023 --> 38:41.376
Don't do that.

38:42.183 --> 38:43.138
Why'd you take your shoes off?

38:43.263 --> 38:45.333
So I don't break your nose when I kick it.

38:55.103 --> 38:56.900
I can fight my own fights.

38:57.823 --> 38:58.938
No, you can't.

38:59.543 --> 39:02.501
Those farmers won't quit till they've
got you and every member of your family

39:02.623 --> 39:05.217
nailed upside-down to a bloody stick
with your eyes gorged out.

39:07.263 --> 39:09.174
This is getting a little too personal.

39:10.423 --> 39:11.776
Give me a minute.

39:26.543 --> 39:27.771
I've got an idea.

39:27.903 --> 39:28.972
- What?
- It could be good.

39:29.103 --> 39:30.661
- Lay it on us.
- It might save our lives.

39:30.783 --> 39:32.102
Say the idea!

39:32.703 --> 39:34.534
All right. Let's try it.

39:35.983 --> 39:39.373
<i>Go to the flint-mine, tell Mrs. Badger et al
that help is on the way.</i>

39:39.503 --> 39:41.095
Is help on the way?

39:41.223 --> 39:42.975
I sure as cuss hope so.

39:48.783 --> 39:52.173
Ash, I know what it's like to feel

39:53.583 --> 39:54.698
different.

39:55.943 --> 39:57.171
I'm not different.

39:57.903 --> 39:59.131
Am I?

39:59.503 --> 40:01.698
We all are. Him, especially.

40:02.383 --> 40:05.375
But there's something kind of fantastic
about that, isn't there?

40:11.223 --> 40:13.817
Not to me. I'd prefer to be an athlete.

40:15.943 --> 40:17.262
Gentlemen,

40:17.383 --> 40:20.420
this time we must dig
in a very special direction.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.937
We have to kind of feel out the vibe.

40:31.063 --> 40:32.052
Begin.

40:55.503 --> 40:59.291
Whoo-hoo! Come on! You guys...
You're not... Come on.

41:05.583 --> 41:08.256
I hit it slap in the middle.
Do you get how incredible this is?

41:10.983 --> 41:14.976
<i>'Bout a handsome little fox
Let me sing you folks a yarn</i>

41:15.103 --> 41:19.381
<i>Hey, diddle-dee, daddle-da,
doddle-do, doodle-dum</i>

41:19.503 --> 41:22.973
<i>'Twas a splendid little fella
Full of wit and grace and charm</i>

41:23.103 --> 41:26.891
<i>Say zippy-zee, zappy-za,
yappy-yo, goggle-gum</i>

41:27.023 --> 41:31.699
<i>Like any little critter needing
Vittles for his little-uns</i>

41:31.823 --> 41:36.897
<i>Well, he stole and he cheated
And he lied just to survive</i>

41:37.023 --> 41:40.060
<i>With a doodle-dum, diddle-di,
duddle, doodle-dum</i>

41:41.983 --> 41:43.894
<i>With a zippy-zo, zippy-zay,
zippy-zappy-zoopy-zee</i>

41:45.103 --> 41:49.494
<i>Oh, doo-dah, doo-dah, day!</i>

41:49.623 --> 41:51.693
<i>Let me take a little tick
To color in the scene</i>

41:51.823 --> 41:56.260
<i>'Cross the valley lived three yokels
Name of Boggis, Bunce and Bean</i>

41:56.383 --> 41:58.499
<i>These three crazy jackies
Had our hero on the run</i>

41:58.623 --> 42:00.579
<i>Shot the tail off the cuss
With a fox-shooting gun</i>

42:00.703 --> 42:02.580
<i>But that stylish little fox
Was clever as a whip</i>

42:02.703 --> 42:06.776
<i>Dug as quick as a gopher
That was hyperactive</i>

42:08.063 --> 42:10.133
<i>Now those three farmers sit</i>

42:10.263 --> 42:12.379
<i>'Twhere there a hole 'twas once a hill</i>

42:12.503 --> 42:15.939
<i>Singing diddle-dee, daddle-da,
doddle-do, doodle-dum</i>

42:16.063 --> 42:20.454
<i>And as far as I can reckon
They're sitting up there still</i>

42:20.583 --> 42:23.893
<i>Singing zippy-zee, zappy-za, yoppy-yo...</i>

42:24.023 --> 42:25.979
What are you singing, Petey?

42:27.023 --> 42:30.015
Just making it up as I went along, really.

42:30.303 --> 42:34.819
That's just weak songwriting.
You wrote a bad song, Petey!

42:53.423 --> 42:54.742
We took everything!

42:55.263 --> 42:56.821
They took everything?

42:57.583 --> 42:59.619
Let me call you back, Petey.

43:01.743 --> 43:03.938
- They could be anywhere.
- Digging right under our feet.

43:04.063 --> 43:05.576
In a sense,
we've only made matters worse.

43:05.703 --> 43:07.933
We should have stayed out of it.

43:38.463 --> 43:39.976
I've got an idea.

43:48.663 --> 43:50.893
I still don't have a signal.
Is anybody getting reception?

43:51.023 --> 43:53.617
I don't have any signal,
but I've had a problem with that.

43:53.743 --> 43:56.815
Crisp up those ducks! Drag those
chickens! Slow down. We're ahead.

43:56.943 --> 44:00.333
Where are the apples?
Slice them up and get them in the pan.

44:00.503 --> 44:04.337
I can imagine how painful,
even emotionally, that must be for you.

44:04.463 --> 44:06.101
It's not the end of the world.

44:06.223 --> 44:09.693
But how humiliating, having
your whole tail blown clean off by...

44:09.823 --> 44:11.302
Can we drop it?

44:15.063 --> 44:16.701
Yeah, really good, sweet, and nice.

44:17.183 --> 44:19.617
They say you're a natural.
True or false?

44:20.263 --> 44:21.332
Answer the question.

44:21.463 --> 44:23.101
- True, I guess.
- Correct.

44:23.343 --> 44:25.538
Get away, Agnes.
I need a private word with Kristofferson.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.780
- Just a minute. She...
- I don't mind.

44:29.263 --> 44:33.381
I just had a brainstorm
for something fantastic I've got to do.

44:33.503 --> 44:34.697
But I can't do it alone.

44:34.823 --> 44:36.176
- I'm not interested.
- Hear me out.

44:36.303 --> 44:39.898
No, thanks. Foxes from your side
of the family take unnecessary risks.

44:40.023 --> 44:43.618
Only because they've got guts
in their blood. So do we.

44:44.063 --> 44:46.531
- Was I a bit rude to Agnes?
- Yeah.

44:46.663 --> 44:49.860
I should probably say something.
I will in a minute.

44:50.703 --> 44:53.217
- What's the brainstorm?
- In a nutshell?

44:53.503 --> 44:55.778
We're going to steal back my dad's tail.

44:55.903 --> 44:58.975
Whoa! Whew! Hmm...

45:06.943 --> 45:08.979
<i>Okay, chief.
- Here we go.</i>

45:21.023 --> 45:24.982
Well, it took a near catastrophe for
all of you to finally take me up on my offer

45:25.103 --> 45:27.378
to have you over
to the flint-mine for dinner.

45:27.503 --> 45:29.892
Maybe my invitation got lost in the mail.

45:30.023 --> 45:32.491
Does anybody know
what he's talking about?

45:32.623 --> 45:36.059
No, Clive's right.
In all seriousness, excuse me, B.

45:36.823 --> 45:40.702
We do have these three ugly farmers
to thank for one thing.

45:40.823 --> 45:43.860
Reminding us to be thankful
and aware of each other.

45:43.983 --> 45:46.053
I'll say it again, aware.

45:59.503 --> 46:02.222
- I don't feel safe.
- That's because we're not.

46:03.023 --> 46:04.900
You should put your bandit hat on.

46:05.023 --> 46:08.140
I don't have one,
but I modified this tube sock.

46:10.783 --> 46:12.819
- We look good.
- Yeah, we do.

46:13.063 --> 46:16.499
Now, where would you keep a prized tail,
if you collected them?

46:16.623 --> 46:19.774
- I'd probably hang it over the mantelpiece.
- Right. Good. In fact...

46:20.103 --> 46:21.934
What's that smell?

46:24.623 --> 46:27.774
Ever tasted one of Mrs. Bean's famous
nutmeg-ginger-apple-snaps?

46:27.903 --> 46:30.542
Well, how do you do?

46:37.343 --> 46:38.776
They are so warm.

46:41.983 --> 46:42.938
Uh-oh.

46:43.063 --> 46:44.337
We got it wrong.

46:44.463 --> 46:46.181
It's not over the mantelpiece.

46:47.183 --> 46:48.411
The necktie.

47:14.143 --> 47:15.781
- Let's go.
- Hang on.

47:15.903 --> 47:16.972
- Two more.
- She's there.

47:17.103 --> 47:18.536
She can't see.

47:24.863 --> 47:27.821
Look at each other. Here we are. Wow.

47:27.943 --> 47:30.298
I've already had too much to drink
and I'm feeling sentimental

47:30.423 --> 47:31.902
but I'll say something anyway,

47:32.023 --> 47:35.140
which nobody wants to admit,
but which is probably true.

47:35.263 --> 47:38.016
We beat them. We beat those farmers

47:38.143 --> 47:40.452
and now we're triumphantly eating
their roasted chicken,

47:40.583 --> 47:43.541
<i>their sizzling duck, their succulent turkey,
their foie gras...</i>

47:45.743 --> 47:47.415
Where'd the boys go?

47:48.103 --> 47:49.934
- Ash! Kristofferson!
- Boys!

47:51.263 --> 47:53.538
That was crazy.
I can't believe what just happened.

47:53.663 --> 47:56.131
Come on, let's get out of here! Let's go!
Where are we?

47:59.783 --> 48:01.011
Kristofferson?

48:01.263 --> 48:05.222
What am I hearing again, baby?
What's happening? Am I still paranoid?

48:08.583 --> 48:09.811
Cider.

48:31.663 --> 48:35.019
What happened? Something with cider.
That was dangerous. Is anyone hurt?

48:35.143 --> 48:38.260
We're all hurt!
My entire flint-mine got demolished!

48:38.383 --> 48:40.419
Apple juice. Apple juice flood.

48:40.543 --> 48:43.740
Do a head count. Everybody pick a buddy.
Where'd the boys go?

48:43.863 --> 48:46.172
Ash! Kristofferson! Ash!

48:46.303 --> 48:47.452
I'm here!

48:48.143 --> 48:50.020
- Who's your buddy?
- Kristofferson.

48:50.143 --> 48:51.132
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

48:51.263 --> 48:52.252
- Why not?
- I lost him.

48:52.383 --> 48:53.577
You lost him?

48:53.703 --> 48:56.900
We were in the kitchen,
trying to find the necktie.

48:57.023 --> 48:58.376
What are you talking about?

48:58.503 --> 48:59.652
It's my fault.

48:59.783 --> 49:02.980
Where did you get
that nutmeg-ginger-apple-snap,

49:03.103 --> 49:05.378
and why are you wearing
that fake bandit hat?

49:05.503 --> 49:06.982
We went to steal back your tail.

49:09.823 --> 49:11.541
Kristofferson!

49:19.103 --> 49:21.173
Wrap this little mutt in a newspaper

49:21.303 --> 49:23.863
and put him in a box
with some holes punched in the top.

49:24.903 --> 49:27.463
There's one way out of the sewer,
but the manhole cover's closed

49:27.583 --> 49:29.096
and a station wagon's parked on it.

49:29.223 --> 49:32.135
Which means,
we're permanently stuck down here.

49:32.823 --> 49:35.291
You still think we beat them, Foxy?

49:52.903 --> 49:56.782
Badger's right. These farmers
aren't going to quit until they catch me.

49:56.903 --> 49:58.131
I shouldn't have lied to your face

49:58.263 --> 50:02.256
or fallen off the wagon and started
secretly stealing chickens on the sly.

50:02.383 --> 50:06.615
I shouldn't have tried to embarrass
these farmers and cuss with their heads.

50:06.743 --> 50:10.258
I enjoyed it, but I shouldn't have done it.
Now there's only one way out.

50:10.743 --> 50:12.779
If I hand myself over, let them kill me,

50:12.903 --> 50:14.655
stuff me
and hang me over their mantelpiece...

50:14.783 --> 50:18.617
- You'll do no such thing.
- Maybe they'll let everyone else live.

50:20.223 --> 50:23.499
Oh, why did you have to get us
into this, Foxy?

50:25.343 --> 50:28.460
I don't know, but I have a possible theory.

50:28.583 --> 50:31.222
I think I need everyone to think
I'm the greatest,

50:31.343 --> 50:34.141
the "fantastic" Mr. Fox.

50:34.263 --> 50:38.017
If they aren't completely knocked out
and dazzled and intimidated by me

50:38.143 --> 50:39.701
I don't feel good about myself.

50:40.463 --> 50:44.661
Foxes traditionally like to court danger,
hunt prey and outsmart predators.

50:44.783 --> 50:46.536
That's what I'm good at.

50:47.663 --> 50:49.142
At the end of the day, I'm just...

50:49.263 --> 50:51.936
I know. We're wild animals.

50:54.103 --> 50:55.980
I guess we always were.

50:56.983 --> 51:00.612
If I had all this to do over again,
I'd have never let you down.

51:00.743 --> 51:03.303
It was always more fun
when we did it together, anyway.

51:04.743 --> 51:07.974
- I love you, Felicity.
- I love you, too.

51:09.863 --> 51:12.138
But I shouldn't have married you.

51:21.543 --> 51:23.898
I tell you about finding out
we were having a cub?

51:24.023 --> 51:25.376
- In the fox trap.
- Right.

51:25.503 --> 51:27.494
- We were at gunpoint, and your mother...
- Said she's pregnant.

51:27.623 --> 51:29.215
Let me tell it, okay?

51:29.343 --> 51:32.733
I had no idea how to get out of this jam.
Then it hit me.

51:32.863 --> 51:34.615
What do foxes do
better than any other animal?

51:34.743 --> 51:36.096
- Dig.
- You're stepping on my lines.

51:36.223 --> 51:37.861
- Keep telling it.
- So we dug.

51:37.983 --> 51:41.180
And the whole time I put paw over paw,
scooping dirt and pebble,

51:41.303 --> 51:42.975
your mother digging like crazy next to me,

51:43.103 --> 51:45.822
I kept wondering,
who is this little boy going to be?

51:45.943 --> 51:47.012
- Or girl.
- Or girl.

51:47.143 --> 51:48.974
Because at that point, we didn't know.

51:49.623 --> 51:52.615
Ash, I'm so glad he was you.

51:54.263 --> 51:56.379
It's not your fault. It's mine.

52:18.143 --> 52:19.337
Good-bye.

52:23.143 --> 52:28.058
Well, I guess we should probably split
into a certain number of groups

52:28.503 --> 52:30.812
and start doing something, right?

52:37.903 --> 52:39.973
Could I have a glass of water?

52:42.783 --> 52:45.456
Excuse me. Excuse me!

52:45.623 --> 52:49.218
Kristofferson! Hello! Can you hear us?

52:50.783 --> 52:52.057
Kristofferson!

52:52.183 --> 52:53.696
They got the boy.

52:58.263 --> 53:00.857
They want to trade the son for his poppa.

53:06.103 --> 53:08.412
Why did they write this
in letters cut out of magazines?

53:08.543 --> 53:12.695
To protect their identities.
Oh, but then why'd they sign their names?

53:12.823 --> 53:15.018
Plus we already knew who they were
because they're trying to kill us.

53:15.423 --> 53:19.257
"Mr. Fox, we have your son.
If you ever want to see him alive again... "

53:19.383 --> 53:21.180
You took the wrong fox!

53:24.223 --> 53:25.417
I'm his son.

53:27.183 --> 53:29.060
I can see the resemblance.

53:31.183 --> 53:32.138
What was that?

53:32.263 --> 53:33.537
Dad!

53:51.063 --> 53:52.621
Stop, man, stop!

53:59.543 --> 54:01.101
Look at you, girl.

54:02.103 --> 54:04.697
<i>You're still as fine-looking
as a crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e.</i>

54:05.863 --> 54:08.741
Am I being flirted with by a psychotic rat?

54:15.503 --> 54:16.822
Ash!

54:16.943 --> 54:18.171
Let me out!

54:18.743 --> 54:21.416
Excuse me. May I cut in?

54:53.183 --> 54:55.378
The boy's locked in an apple crate

54:55.503 --> 55:00.054
on top of a gun locker
in the attic of Bean Annex.

55:01.983 --> 55:03.939
Would you have told me
if I didn't kill you first?

55:05.463 --> 55:06.452
Never.

55:07.743 --> 55:11.452
All these wasted years.
What were you looking for, Rat?

55:12.983 --> 55:14.814
He's trying to say something, Dad.

55:16.223 --> 55:17.451
Cider.

55:22.583 --> 55:27.782
Here you are, Rat.
A beaker of Bean's finest secret cider.

55:31.983 --> 55:34.543
Like melted gold.

55:43.023 --> 55:46.857
- He redeemed himself.
- Redemption, sure.

55:47.823 --> 55:49.620
But in the end, he's just another dead rat

55:49.743 --> 55:52.576
in a garbage pail
behind a Chinese restaurant.

56:06.743 --> 56:10.133
- He went bananas.
- Yes, he did.

56:11.743 --> 56:13.176
My suicide mission has been canceled.

56:13.303 --> 56:15.612
We're replacing it
with a go-for-broke rescue mission.

56:17.583 --> 56:20.222
In a way,
I'm almost glad that flood interrupted us,

56:20.343 --> 56:23.813
because I don't like the toast I was giving.
I'm going to start over.

56:27.143 --> 56:30.818
When I look down this table,
with the exquisite feast set before us,

56:30.943 --> 56:32.934
I see two terrific lawyers,

56:33.063 --> 56:34.974
a skilled pediatrician, a wonderful chef,

56:35.103 --> 56:38.140
a savvy real estate agent,
an excellent tailor, a crack accountant,

56:38.263 --> 56:40.333
a gifted musician,
a pretty good minnow fisherman,

56:40.463 --> 56:44.172
and possibly the best landscape painter
working on the scene today.

56:44.303 --> 56:46.863
Maybe a few of you might even
read my column from time to time.

56:46.983 --> 56:48.416
I tend to doubt it.

56:49.663 --> 56:52.496
I also see a room full of wild animals.

56:53.343 --> 56:56.653
Wild animals with true natures
and pure talents.

56:57.143 --> 57:00.977
With scientific-sounding Latin names
that mean something about our DNA.

57:01.423 --> 57:05.416
Each with his own strengths
and weaknesses due to his or her species.

57:06.863 --> 57:10.856
Anyway, I think it may very well be
all the beautiful differences among us

57:10.983 --> 57:14.339
that might just give us the tiniest glimmer
of a chance of saving my nephew

57:14.463 --> 57:18.502
and letting me make it up to you for
getting us into this crazy whatever-it-is.

57:18.623 --> 57:22.980
I don't know, it's just a thought.
Thank you for listening. Cheers, everyone.

57:26.423 --> 57:27.742
Let's eat!

57:29.663 --> 57:32.097
What? I was just playing along
with the bit he was doing.

57:33.583 --> 57:35.141
Will you join me?

57:36.343 --> 57:37.492
I will.

57:39.983 --> 57:42.338
Oh, all right, I guess.
- Thank you.

57:43.543 --> 57:45.659
Let's start planning.
Who knows shorthand?

57:45.783 --> 57:49.059
<i>Great. Linda, Lutra lutra.
You got some dry paper? Here we go.</i>

57:49.183 --> 57:51.902
<i>- Mole, Talpa europea. What do you got?
- I can see in the dark.</i>

57:52.023 --> 57:54.014
- Incredible. We can use that. Linda?
- Got it.

57:54.383 --> 57:56.260
<i>- Rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus.
- I'm fast.</i>

57:56.383 --> 57:57.896
- You bet you are. Linda?
- Got it.

57:58.143 --> 57:59.815
<i>- Beaver, Castor fiber.
- I chew through wood.</i>

57:59.943 --> 58:01.137
- Amazing! Linda!
- Got it.

58:01.423 --> 58:03.539
<i>- Badger, Meles meles!
- Demolitions expert.</i>

58:03.663 --> 58:06.621
- What? Since when?
- Explosions, flames, burning things!

58:06.743 --> 58:08.574
- Demolitions expert. Okay, Linda?
- Got it.

58:08.863 --> 58:11.980
<i>- Weasel, Mustela nivalis!
- Stop yelling!</i>

58:14.063 --> 58:15.815
Ash,
get these little kids organized

58:15.943 --> 58:18.821
and put together a K.P. unit
to keep this sewer clean.

58:18.943 --> 58:19.898
It's good for morale.

58:20.023 --> 58:23.459
- Done. What's K.P.?
- Um, I think it means janitors.

58:26.583 --> 58:30.417
Me. Yo, over here, hey.
I want to go. I want to fight.

58:31.783 --> 58:34.741
<i>Good. Fabulous. Microtus pennsylvanicus.</i>

58:37.103 --> 58:40.618
I didn't get a job yet. Or a Latin name.
What's my strength?

58:41.223 --> 58:43.896
Listen, you're Kylie.
You're an unbelievably nice guy.

58:44.023 --> 58:46.696
Your job is really
just to be available, I think.

58:46.823 --> 58:49.656
I don't know your Latin name. I doubt
they had opossums in ancient Rome.

58:59.264 --> 59:01.175
- It's stupendous! Where's us?
- Right here.

59:01.304 --> 59:02.532
Paint an X.

59:04.784 --> 59:06.581
<i>Dear Farmers Boggis,
Bunce and Bean:</i>

59:06.704 --> 59:08.979
<i>I have no alternative
but to agree to your terms.</i>

59:09.104 --> 59:10.935
<i>Move the station wagon
and open the manhole cover</i>

59:11.064 --> 59:13.214
<i>below the drainpipe by the cobbler shop</i>

59:13.344 --> 59:16.381
<i>and meet me there at 10:00 A.M. sharp.
I will hand myself over to you</i>

59:16.504 --> 59:19.860
<i>in exchange for the boy's safe return.
Cordially, Mr. Fox.</i>

59:21.024 --> 59:23.584
Why'd he write this
in letters cut out of magazines?

59:23.704 --> 59:25.660
I don't know, but you did the same thing.

59:25.784 --> 59:28.821
I don't trust this guy.
Anyway, set up the ambush.

59:29.064 --> 59:32.454
Synchronize your clocks.
The time is now 9:45 A.M.

59:33.704 --> 59:35.615
Put these bandit hats on.

01:00:28.744 --> 01:00:30.143
Did you bring the boy?

01:00:30.744 --> 01:00:33.895
Of course we did. Say something, kid.

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:37.373
<i>Excuse me. Excuse me!</i>

01:00:37.824 --> 01:00:41.055
That doesn't sound anything like him.
It's amateur night in Dixie.

01:00:49.864 --> 01:00:51.855
What the cuss is he burning?

01:00:53.064 --> 01:00:55.658
<i>Boggis, Bunce, Bean</i>

01:00:56.544 --> 01:00:59.342
<i>One fat, one short, one lean</i>

01:01:04.824 --> 01:01:06.655
Is that all you've got, Mr. Fox?

01:01:08.504 --> 01:01:10.222
<i>Boggis, Bunce and Bean</i>

01:01:10.344 --> 01:01:12.016
<i>One fat, one short, one lean</i>

01:01:12.144 --> 01:01:13.816
<i>These horrible crooks
So different in looks</i>

01:01:13.944 --> 01:01:15.775
<i>Were nonetheless equally mean...</i>

01:01:16.544 --> 01:01:17.977
It's unclear whether these...

01:01:23.144 --> 01:01:24.862
<i>Boggis, Bunce and Bean</i>

01:01:24.984 --> 01:01:26.736
<i>One fat, one short, one lean</i>

01:01:26.864 --> 01:01:28.536
<i>Horrible crooks

01:01:28.664 --> 01:01:30.461
<i>Nonetheless equally mean</i>

01:01:35.264 --> 01:01:37.539
28 pinecones fired, 22 targets hit.

01:01:41.424 --> 01:01:42.743
Decoy phase, go.

01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:45.539
<i>Yes, sir. Domino Santo, one, two, three.</i>

01:01:58.864 --> 01:01:59.899
Dad's on fire!

01:02:02.984 --> 01:02:05.942
- Foxy, you're on.
- We're ready.

01:02:06.984 --> 01:02:09.703
- I'm going to find him and bring him back.
- I know you will.

01:02:11.024 --> 01:02:12.173
Contact!

01:02:26.584 --> 01:02:28.176
Are you scared of wolves?

01:02:28.304 --> 01:02:30.295
No. I have a phobia of them.

01:02:30.424 --> 01:02:33.336
- I have a thing about thunder.
- Why? That's stupid.

01:02:33.464 --> 01:02:35.375
I don't like needles myself.

01:02:35.504 --> 01:02:37.540
Where'd you come from again?
How did you get in the sidecar?

01:02:37.664 --> 01:02:38.938
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

01:02:42.344 --> 01:02:44.904
I've got a fox on a motorcycle,
with a littler fox

01:02:45.024 --> 01:02:47.413
and what looks like to be
an opossum in the sidecar,

01:02:47.544 --> 01:02:49.262
riding north on Farm Lane Seven.

01:02:49.864 --> 01:02:51.775
Does that sound like anything to anybody?

01:02:51.904 --> 01:02:53.257
<i>Red, it's Franklin Bean.</i>

01:02:53.384 --> 01:02:57.059
<i>Turn around, get the cuss back here
and pick us up on the ASAP.</i>

01:03:22.824 --> 01:03:24.177
Ah!

01:03:27.424 --> 01:03:29.301
- You got a credit card?
- Sure.

01:03:29.424 --> 01:03:32.382
This is what I was saying about
how good you are, just being available.

01:03:32.504 --> 01:03:35.894
A titanium card?
How the cuss did you qualify for this?

01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:38.379
I pay my bills on time.
I've always had good credit.

01:03:46.304 --> 01:03:47.293
Come on.

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:50.973
What's this thing you do?
The whistle with the clicking sound?

01:03:51.984 --> 01:03:53.542
What do you mean? That's my trademark.

01:04:24.184 --> 01:04:25.742
Give me a blueberry.

01:04:27.424 --> 01:04:28.857
- Blueberry.
- You didn't say anything...

01:04:28.984 --> 01:04:32.533
You forgot the blueberries?
I did say it! I wrote it on your paw!

01:04:32.944 --> 01:04:34.900
Yeah. It's written on the front of your paw.

01:04:38.344 --> 01:04:41.814
- What's that white stuff around his mouth?
- I think he eats soap.

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:49.222
- That's not soap.
- Then why does he have that bubbly...

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:52.859
He's rabid. With rabies.
I've heard about this beagle.

01:04:55.184 --> 01:04:57.334
You two go ahead while I distract him.

01:05:13.264 --> 01:05:14.174
Hey.

01:05:16.424 --> 01:05:17.777
I can fit through there.

01:05:19.504 --> 01:05:21.779
- Want to know why?
- Why?

01:05:22.584 --> 01:05:24.222
Because I'm little.

01:05:24.984 --> 01:05:26.337
Give me that shoelace.

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:35.819
Psst! Psst!

01:05:35.944 --> 01:05:37.935
It's me. I'm rescuing you.

01:05:39.784 --> 01:05:43.333
- I have mixed feelings about that.
- I don't blame you.

01:05:46.864 --> 01:05:49.662
Can you give me a karate lesson
real quick?

01:05:50.664 --> 01:05:53.019
Okay. Stand like this.

01:05:53.504 --> 01:05:55.176
Position yourself on the balls of your feet.

01:05:55.304 --> 01:05:58.262
Close your eyes.
You weigh less than a slice of bread.

01:06:00.584 --> 01:06:03.257
I feel there's a tenderness in your eyes,
isn't there?

01:06:03.624 --> 01:06:04.852
Yes, I'm right.

01:06:05.384 --> 01:06:09.662
Let's review the principal agility
techniques: jumping, flipping, landing.

01:06:09.984 --> 01:06:14.057
You're a good boy.
A little lonely, maybe, but terribly sweet.

01:06:14.544 --> 01:06:17.456
Is your name Spitz?
That's German, isn't it?

01:06:18.304 --> 01:06:20.818
Now, a rudimentary version
of the cyclone chop.

01:06:20.944 --> 01:06:23.412
First, get a running start,
which, obviously, I can't do here.

01:06:23.544 --> 01:06:25.296
Then, at the destination of the chop,

01:06:25.424 --> 01:06:28.143
lean and thrust into the point of contact,
paw open and straight,

01:06:28.264 --> 01:06:30.778
then withdraw instantaneously.
It's the pull-back that matters.

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:33.464
The pull-back generates
the force of the impact.

01:06:34.024 --> 01:06:35.173
Got it.

01:06:36.664 --> 01:06:39.736
Yeah, I'm just going to chop this thing
right off.

01:06:48.744 --> 01:06:50.097
He's going to do it.

01:06:52.904 --> 01:06:55.896
Why, you're just as sweet as a...

01:06:57.264 --> 01:06:59.619
I thought he said
never look a beagle in the eye.

01:07:10.144 --> 01:07:12.977
- Did you chop it?
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:07:26.704 --> 01:07:28.137
Kristofferson.

01:07:29.544 --> 01:07:31.102
Uh, I'm okay.

01:07:32.344 --> 01:07:34.858
- I'm okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:07:35.624 --> 01:07:38.536
That's all right. You were just trying
to unlock the apple crate.

01:07:39.344 --> 01:07:41.858
No. I mean I'm sorry about...

01:07:42.744 --> 01:07:46.339
Oh, you mean from before. The apology
you owed me, but never actually said.

01:07:46.464 --> 01:07:50.935
Right. I'm grumpy. I spit.
I wake up on the wrong side of the bed.

01:07:51.064 --> 01:07:54.454
I'm just different, apparently.

01:07:54.584 --> 01:07:56.700
But it won't happen again.

01:07:58.024 --> 01:07:59.582
Kristofferson, I'm sorry.

01:08:02.104 --> 01:08:04.060
Well, that's all right, too.

01:08:04.744 --> 01:08:05.938
Throw me the shoelace, please.

01:08:17.264 --> 01:08:18.662
You okay?

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:50.812
He's wearing it.

01:08:54.823 --> 01:08:59.500
Your tractors uprooted my tree,
your posse hunted my family,

01:08:59.624 --> 01:09:04.538
your gunmen kidnapped my nephew,
your rat insulted my wife,

01:09:04.743 --> 01:09:06.974
and you shot off my tail.

01:09:07.144 --> 01:09:10.055
I'm not leaving here without that necktie.

01:09:11.384 --> 01:09:12.612
Kill him!

01:09:21.064 --> 01:09:23.339
Actually, we should just go.
Where did I park?

01:09:23.944 --> 01:09:25.821
I weigh less than a slice of bread.

01:09:26.743 --> 01:09:28.654
- I'll be right back.
- Ash!

01:09:37.104 --> 01:09:40.413
Dodge the grabbers, duck the taggers,
jump the twig-basket and

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:42.136
knock the cedar-stick off the cross-rock!

01:10:00.504 --> 01:10:01.778
Hot box!

01:10:29.904 --> 01:10:33.817
Ash, that was pure wild animal craziness.
You're an athlete.

01:10:34.504 --> 01:10:35.459
Mmm-hmm.

01:10:35.584 --> 01:10:37.654
Here, put this bandit hat on.

01:10:40.744 --> 01:10:41.972
Goggles.

01:10:42.824 --> 01:10:44.177
<i>Boggis, Bunce and Bean</i>

01:10:44.304 --> 01:10:45.578
<i>One fat, one short
one lean</i>

01:10:51.544 --> 01:10:52.533
Are you going to...

01:10:55.104 --> 01:10:59.495
Holy swearing cuss!

01:11:09.544 --> 01:11:11.182
Petey, bring us a ladder, please.

01:11:12.184 --> 01:11:13.333
Stand by!

01:11:13.464 --> 01:11:16.183
I just intercepted
a high-frequency radio signal with the can,

01:11:16.304 --> 01:11:17.703
they're on their way home!

01:11:26.584 --> 01:11:28.939
Don't turn around.

01:11:37.944 --> 01:11:39.696
Where'd he come from?

01:11:40.944 --> 01:11:42.536
Where'd you come from?

01:11:43.864 --> 01:11:45.741
What are you doing here?

01:11:47.144 --> 01:11:48.702
<i>Canis lupus.</i>

01:11:49.464 --> 01:11:51.022
<i>Vulpes vulpes.</i>

01:11:52.744 --> 01:11:54.780
I don't think he speaks English or Latin.

01:11:59.264 --> 01:12:01.858
I'm asking if he thinks
we're in for a hard winter.

01:12:05.544 --> 01:12:07.421
He doesn't seem to know.

01:12:09.544 --> 01:12:11.739
I have a phobia of wolves!

01:12:26.624 --> 01:12:30.333
What a beautiful creature.
Wish him luck, boys.

01:12:30.744 --> 01:12:32.780
- Good luck, wolf.
- Good luck out there.

01:12:54.224 --> 01:12:57.057
These three, in this reporter's opinion,
obsessed farmers

01:12:57.184 --> 01:13:01.496
remain convinced the fox in question
will eventually reappear. Why?

01:13:01.824 --> 01:13:03.974
- Foxes aren't meant to live in a sewer.
- They're refugees.

01:13:04.104 --> 01:13:06.937
- All they have to eat down there is...
- Trash!

01:13:07.304 --> 01:13:08.862
And not much of it.

01:13:09.264 --> 01:13:10.219
Uh-huh.

01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:14.417
Thank you, farmers.
For Action 12, this is Dan Peabody.

01:13:16.744 --> 01:13:18.894
- What is it?
- His tonsils are a little swollen.

01:13:19.024 --> 01:13:21.538
- Is it serious?
- No. Hopefully, he won't have to lose them.

01:13:21.664 --> 01:13:23.017
Lose the tonsils?

01:13:23.584 --> 01:13:27.577
- I'm hungry.
- Have some water. Here.

01:13:27.704 --> 01:13:29.456
We try to keep things simple.

01:13:29.584 --> 01:13:32.894
This is the first time I've been
to a party where no one serves anything.

01:13:45.744 --> 01:13:47.257
My darlings.

01:13:48.584 --> 01:13:49.983
Where are we going?
Nobody knows.

01:13:50.104 --> 01:13:51.617
We were in the middle
of a meditation practice.

01:13:51.744 --> 01:13:54.577
Watch your step.
Let's see, where does this lead?

01:13:54.704 --> 01:13:56.934
Oh, no. Foxy, it's filthy.

01:13:57.064 --> 01:13:59.419
Keep a good grip, everyone.
- This better be worth it.

01:13:59.544 --> 01:14:04.254
I think I see a little sliver of light.
What's this? Is it a door?

01:14:04.584 --> 01:14:06.302
You're a terrible actor, Foxy.

01:14:06.424 --> 01:14:08.984
Do you smell something?
Is that Freon?

01:14:09.104 --> 01:14:12.779
Shh! I'm going to open this trap door
and see if something's on the other side.

01:14:12.904 --> 01:14:15.737
I highly doubt it, though.
There's probably just more sewer.

01:14:16.504 --> 01:14:18.335
- Wouldn't it be surprising if...
Open it.

01:14:25.744 --> 01:14:29.498
Look, there's a whole enormous, glorious,
gigantic supermarket up here.

01:14:29.824 --> 01:14:32.054
And they close early on weekends.

01:14:35.944 --> 01:14:40.176
You really are kind of a quote-unquote
"fantastic" fox.

01:14:40.304 --> 01:14:42.818
I try. Get enough to share with everybody.

01:14:42.944 --> 01:14:46.334
Remember, the Rabbits are vegetarians
and Badger supposedly can't eat walnuts.

01:14:48.704 --> 01:14:51.935
I guess now that Kristofferson's dad
is already down to single pneumonia

01:14:52.064 --> 01:14:53.941
he'll be going home soon.

01:14:54.064 --> 01:14:55.941
Actually, when he spoke to me
from the hospital

01:14:56.064 --> 01:14:57.133
he said he was already talking to Weasel

01:14:57.264 --> 01:14:59.858
about real estate availability
in our sewer system.

01:14:59.984 --> 01:15:01.815
Really? Well, now's the time to buy.

01:15:07.104 --> 01:15:08.059
Ha!

01:15:10.064 --> 01:15:12.180
Okay. I get it. Is that your trademark?

01:15:15.624 --> 01:15:18.661
- I'm pregnant again.
- Wow.

01:15:20.744 --> 01:15:22.541
I think we're both glowing.

01:15:25.984 --> 01:15:27.383
Do another toast, Dad.

01:15:29.304 --> 01:15:30.703
Okay, uh...

01:15:38.464 --> 01:15:41.854
They say all foxes
are slightly allergic to linoleum.

01:15:41.984 --> 01:15:44.214
But it's cool to the paw. Try it.

01:15:47.144 --> 01:15:49.977
They say my tail needs to be dry-cleaned
twice a month.

01:15:50.424 --> 01:15:51.698
But now it's fully detachable.

01:15:51.824 --> 01:15:52.779
See?

01:15:53.784 --> 01:15:58.335
They say our tree may never grow back.
But one day something will.

01:15:59.944 --> 01:16:02.299
These crackles
are made of synthetic goose

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:04.654
and these giblets
come from artificial squab.

01:16:04.784 --> 01:16:08.333
Even these apples look fake.
But at least they've got stars on them.

01:16:09.944 --> 01:16:13.903
My point is, we'll eat tonight,
and we'll eat together.

01:16:14.024 --> 01:16:17.175
And even in this
not particularly flattering light,

01:16:18.104 --> 01:16:22.620
you are without a doubt the 51/2
most wonderful wild animals

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:24.860
I've ever met in my life.

01:16:26.104 --> 01:16:27.742
So let's raise our boxes.

01:16:30.784 --> 01:16:33.503
To our survival.

01:16:39.864 --> 01:16:41.217
How was that?

01:16:41.464 --> 01:16:42.453
Mmm.

01:16:42.584 --> 01:16:44.336
That was a good toast.

01:16:59.184 --> 01:17:02.574
<i>Well, there she goes
with a brand new love affair</i>

01:17:03.064 --> 01:17:05.737
<i>Dancing with him
like she don't even care</i>

01:17:06.184 --> 01:17:09.938
<i>Well, let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long</i>

01:17:10.064 --> 01:17:12.020
<i>Let her dance, let her dance
Dance, dance</i>

01:17:12.144 --> 01:17:15.375
<i>Let her dance, let her dance
Let her dance, dance, dance</i>

01:17:15.504 --> 01:17:19.577
<i>Well, who would have known
that just yesterday</i>

01:17:19.704 --> 01:17:22.172
<i>She danced with me the very same way</i>

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:26.536
<i>Well, let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long</i>

01:17:26.664 --> 01:17:28.700
<i>Let her dance, let her dance
Dance, dance</i>

01:17:28.824 --> 01:17:31.941
<i>Let her dance, let her dance
Let her dance, dance, dance</i>

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:35.739
<i>Well, let her dance with him all night long</i>

01:17:36.024 --> 01:17:38.777
<i>Let her dance to our favorite song</i>

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:42.613
<i>Well, let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long</i>

01:17:42.744 --> 01:17:45.338
<i>Let her dance, let her dance
Dance, let her dance</i>

01:17:45.464 --> 01:17:48.695
<i>Let her dance, let her dance
Dance, dance, dance</i>

01:18:17.424 --> 01:18:21.417
<i>Well, I'll find me a new love
And then she'll see</i>

01:18:21.544 --> 01:18:24.536
<i>Someone else will be dancing with me</i>

01:18:24.744 --> 01:18:28.339
<i>Let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long</i>

01:18:28.464 --> 01:18:31.137
<i>Let her dance, let her dance
Dance, dance, let her dance</i>

01:18:31.264 --> 01:18:34.062
<i>Let her dance, let her dance
Dance, dance, let her dance</i>

01:18:34.184 --> 01:18:37.620
<i>Well, let her dance with him all night long</i>

01:18:37.744 --> 01:18:40.542
<i>Let her dance to our favorite song</i>

01:18:40.664 --> 01:18:44.703
<i>Well, let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long</i>

01:18:44.824 --> 01:18:47.258
<i>Let her dance, let her dance
Dance, dance</i>

01:18:47.384 --> 01:18:50.376
<i>Let her dance, let her dance
Let her dance with him</i>

01:18:50.504 --> 01:18:54.292
<i>Well, let her dance with him all night long</i>

01:18:54.424 --> 01:18:56.892
<i>Let her dance to our favorite song</i>

01:18:57.024 --> 01:19:01.381
<i>Let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long</i>

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:05.100
<i>Let her dance, let her dance
Let her dance, let her dance</i>

01:19:05.224 --> 01:19:08.375
<i>Dance, dance, dance, dance
Let her dance, let her dance</i>

01:19:08.504 --> 01:19:10.096
<i>Let her dance, dance, dance</i>
