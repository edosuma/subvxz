WEBVTT

00:09.050 --> 00:12.554
The level of effects is so high right now

00:12.721 --> 00:17.058
that the only limitation is
basically money and imagination.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.893
It's almost like we've come full circle.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.063
We now have to be telling
a damn good story with good characters,

00:22.147 --> 00:23.648
and the effects are more of a given.

00:23.732 --> 00:27.736
You can no longer earn
somebody's sense of satisfaction

00:27.819 --> 00:29.529
just because you dazzled them visually.

00:29.612 --> 00:33.450
I really believe that effects
need to service the story.

00:33.575 --> 00:38.455
When the effects become the story,
we've lost our way.

00:38.621 --> 00:41.958
The story is still the story
is still the story is still the story.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.752
Whether you write it in pencil

00:43.877 --> 00:46.671
or you write it in ink,
it's the same story.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.674
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:35.220 --> 01:38.848
You can never pinpoint
how or why things happen.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.560
And there's always a collision
of circumstances,

01:42.644 --> 01:46.731
a little bit of luck.
Sometimes something goes wrong

01:46.898 --> 01:49.859
that actually sets you on another course,

01:49.943 --> 01:55.115
and in this case, we had started

01:55.198 --> 01:57.117
talking about doing <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

01:57.575 --> 02:02.997
We convinced Stan Winston and Dennis Muren
at ILM to work together.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.128
MARK DIPPE: <i>Steven Spielberg</i>
<i>always has the A-team.</i>

02:08.211 --> 02:10.421
<i>He had the four best in their arenas.</i>

02:10.713 --> 02:13.800
The four horsemen there.
You got Stan Winston.

02:13.883 --> 02:17.720
<i>He's creature creator builder</i>
<i>par excellence, he's the best around.</i>

02:17.929 --> 02:22.976
<i>He got Phil Tippett. He's Mr. Creature</i>
<i>animator, puppeteer, stop motion.</i>

02:23.059 --> 02:27.063
<i>He's the guy. You got Michael Lantieri,</i>
<i>who's the practical effects guy.</i>

02:27.147 --> 02:29.649
<i>And you got Dennis Muren.</i>
<i>He's the visual effects wizard</i>

02:29.774 --> 02:31.442
<i>that can take the stuff these people do</i>

02:31.526 --> 02:33.862
<i>and make it all work together</i>
<i>and look like it's real.</i>

02:33.945 --> 02:38.324
I've heard anecdotally that Steven
was looking for someone that could help

02:38.408 --> 02:43.037
<i>with the dinosaurs,</i>
<i>and George said, "Phil's your guy."</i>

02:43.580 --> 02:47.208
I was completely ready to go down
the Phil Tippett route

02:47.292 --> 02:51.671
to be able to create these animals
in all the wide shots that Stan Winston

02:51.754 --> 02:54.924
<i>wasn't creating in his monster shop.</i>

02:55.425 --> 02:58.052
At that point in time,
with that technology,

02:58.136 --> 03:02.932
we were going to use the stop motion
puppet and high speed miniatures.

03:03.057 --> 03:06.060
DENNIS: <i>Just going to go stop motion.</i>
<i>We could go in and help</i>

03:06.144 --> 03:08.646
<i>some of the animation</i>
<i>as a post-production thing,</i>

03:08.771 --> 03:11.274
to help smooth it out and make it better.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.943
MARK: <i>Dennis goes, "Okay,</i>
<i>we've got to figure out what to do,</i>

03:14.027 --> 03:15.528
<i>"so this doesn't look like</i>

03:15.612 --> 03:18.031
"the stop motion pictures of
before Ray Harryhausen."

03:18.114 --> 03:21.993
"So you guys can add the blur," and I go,
"Yeah, sure we can add the blur."

03:22.076 --> 03:26.164
But my belief was, man, we've already done
stuff that's so far advanced from that.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.374
<i>Why are we saying</i>
<i>this is what we're going to do?</i>

03:28.458 --> 03:30.418
Well, we can do CG dinosaurs.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.922
DENNIS: <i>I was very reluctant</i>
<i>to even think about doing</i>

03:34.005 --> 03:37.217
<i>the CG or computer graphics thing</i>
<i>at the beginning of it.</i>

03:37.634 --> 03:41.804
Didn't seem like we were ready for a show
that big and much more complicated

03:41.888 --> 03:42.889
than <i>Terminator 2.</i>

03:43.264 --> 03:44.557
MARK: <i>Dennis is a believer,</i>

03:44.641 --> 03:48.686
but he's a realist, so he's like...
You know, we did <i>The Abyss,</i>

03:48.770 --> 03:52.941
<i>we did</i> T2,
<i>but those are alien hard surfaces.</i>

03:54.317 --> 03:57.654
They're not natural, organic,
breathing, sweating, bleeding things.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.031
We haven't really done that successfully.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.366
I don't know.

04:01.449 --> 04:04.911
<i>The other point is that they've already</i>
<i>pushed the project in a direction.</i>

04:04.994 --> 04:08.414
<i>They spent a lot of time and money.</i>
<i>They're already building huge things.</i>

04:08.498 --> 04:12.001
But what I said to Spaz is,
"We cannot not try."

04:12.794 --> 04:16.965
<i>So after hours, basically,</i>
<i>we began building the bones of the T. rex.</i>

04:17.048 --> 04:18.466
(PRINTER BUZZING)

04:20.843 --> 04:22.053
SPAZ: <i>I started with bones.</i>

04:22.136 --> 04:24.889
I scan in a T. rex mukada,
some perfect specimen

04:25.014 --> 04:27.558
that they had found flat
on a high tech scanner.

04:28.559 --> 04:30.895
<i>Put it up on my monitor</i>
<i>and built the bones,</i>

04:30.979 --> 04:33.690
made him 3D, had a great pose, you know,

04:33.815 --> 04:37.277
and then started animating it
as a forward kinematic process.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.946
<i>So I had a walking Rex on bones.</i>

04:40.029 --> 04:43.283
I'm pretty sure that Dennis
saw the walking bones.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.868
But again, it's kind of like,
"Okay, that's really cool,

04:45.952 --> 04:47.370
"you know, but living, breathing."

04:47.453 --> 04:49.122
We're not doing skeletons.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.207
Phil Tippett was way down the road

04:51.916 --> 04:55.420
<i>with his stop motion,</i>
<i>and they were looking really good.</i>

04:55.962 --> 04:58.715
KATHLEEN: <i>Phil Tippett is working away.</i>

04:59.465 --> 05:01.759
<i>Stan Winston is working away.</i>

05:02.010 --> 05:04.304
<i>We're pulling every single tool together</i>

05:04.387 --> 05:07.765
<i>to figure this out</i>
<i>and seeing shot for shot what can work.</i>

05:07.849 --> 05:11.936
Things were now moving. Kathy Kennedy
was coming up once in a while.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.398
SPAZ: <i>I knew they were coming up,</i>

05:15.481 --> 05:19.444
Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall,
on November 14th, 1991.

05:19.527 --> 05:23.489
They were like an ensemble
moving through, right? The company.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.700
And I knew where they were
in C building here.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.702
So this is kind of this big moment.

05:27.994 --> 05:32.332
No one's going to present this idea
because no one believes in it.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.960
SPAZ: <i>So I had a monitor position</i>
<i>and I had the cycle going,</i>

05:36.044 --> 05:39.339
<i>this walking T. rex in bone</i>
<i>and they came walking in,</i>

05:39.464 --> 05:41.090
and it was a total ambush.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.551
There's this room we have
where we screen these clips

05:43.634 --> 05:46.220
<i>and they'll be on monitors</i>
<i>and they could be on a loop.</i>

05:46.304 --> 05:49.057
People can see them and go,
"I like that or I don't like that."

05:49.140 --> 05:50.641
She was looking at something else.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.728
Go into this room and there's this kid
sitting there, it looks like,

05:53.811 --> 05:56.981
and he's really a kid,
and he's manipulating everything.

05:57.106 --> 06:00.026
<i>And Dennis and I are staring</i>
<i>at this computer screen.</i>

06:00.443 --> 06:03.863
MARK: <i>I can remember her saying,</i>
<i>"What's going on with that?</i>

06:03.946 --> 06:06.866
"That's a dinosaur bone.
I mean, that's part of <i>Jurassic,</i> right?

06:06.991 --> 06:07.992
"So what is that?"

06:08.117 --> 06:11.913
I said, I'm just messing around like that,
you know, and she patted me on the back

06:11.996 --> 06:14.332
and she goes,
"You have a very bright future."

06:14.415 --> 06:16.084
That's what she said. (LAUGHS)

06:16.334 --> 06:20.588
The first thing, of course, I said to
Dennis was, "Well, what does this mean?

06:21.089 --> 06:24.759
"Can we do some shots this way?
What? How's this going to work?"

06:25.301 --> 06:28.805
And he said, "We're working on something
to show Steven."

06:29.097 --> 06:30.848
They ended up speeding up the test,

06:30.932 --> 06:34.102
doing it faster and faster,
and it ended up working

06:34.185 --> 06:37.480
at every step of the way that it was
sort of undeniable that they...

06:37.563 --> 06:42.402
Just had to, like, consider it,
even though Phil was starting on the show

06:42.485 --> 06:45.196
and his company was gearing up
and everything like that.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.365
SPAZ: <i>Dennis was</i>
<i>in a very difficult position,</i>

06:47.448 --> 06:51.786
<i>you can imagine, because here</i>
<i>we are doing this clandestine thing.</i>

06:51.869 --> 06:56.249
<i>Yet his buddy is supposed to be doing</i>
<i>the entire film in stop motion, you know,</i>

06:56.332 --> 06:58.751
and we're sneaking around doing this,
you know.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.257
PHIL: <i>It was Mark and Steve</i>

07:04.340 --> 07:08.886
that had a belief that they could
make dinosaurs, and they did.

07:08.970 --> 07:15.393
They pulled it off terrifically well.
But there was a bit of antagonism there,

07:15.476 --> 07:19.355
and it was kind of, like,
the old gunslinger.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.817
And, you know, the new one, you know,

07:22.900 --> 07:28.364
it was like there was a competition
that I thought was like, "Why?"

07:29.490 --> 07:31.784
Phil Tippett. In those days,
he did not believe

07:31.868 --> 07:34.495
in the computer's ability
to create lifelike creatures.

07:34.620 --> 07:38.416
He believed that the linearity,
the perfectness,

07:38.541 --> 07:40.960
the mathematical aspect of computers

07:41.043 --> 07:44.297
makes them create things
that have that characteristic,

07:44.881 --> 07:46.507
<i>and things like the liquid metal man.</i>

07:46.632 --> 07:47.675
Get out.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.844
Whereas living, breathing creatures
do unexpected things,

07:49.927 --> 07:52.722
don't behave the way you want
when they trip or break their leg.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.182
It looks all ugly and messed up.

07:54.265 --> 07:59.520
He was sort of philosophically
against that approach.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.856
He was dealing with this thing
that he saw as being,

08:01.939 --> 08:04.609
you know, a Voldemort. Computers, right?

08:04.692 --> 08:06.944
You know, I'd see him there
working on the computer

08:07.028 --> 08:11.491
with the mouse and all this stuff
and just... (MUTTERING)

08:11.616 --> 08:14.827
And what I visualized was like,
you'd be saying,

08:14.911 --> 08:16.370
"Okay, well, if you're a cowboy

08:16.454 --> 08:19.582
"and you have two six-guns,
let's see you shoot that tin can

08:19.665 --> 08:22.835
"off that post 100 feet away."
And they go like...

08:22.919 --> 08:25.588
(MIMICKING GUNSHOTS)

08:26.589 --> 08:28.758
I was like, "Well,
why didn't you shoot the can?

08:28.841 --> 08:32.678
"Well, I don't have any bullets."
(LAUGHING) "But I do this really well."

08:38.351 --> 08:40.228
So what happened then is now

08:40.311 --> 08:44.440
the project became official,
as in sort of an experiment at ILM.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.235
Obviously, Dennis had talked
to Spielberg about it,

08:47.318 --> 08:50.780
and so more money
had secretly come to ILM,

08:50.988 --> 08:54.075
and we find out that they want us
to build the whole skin.

08:54.283 --> 08:58.454
I have heard Dennis Muren say
that the view paint,

08:58.538 --> 09:02.708
the texture painting, was the thing
that made the transformation for <i>Jurassic.</i>

09:02.792 --> 09:06.629
It took a long time, I think it was
six months to paint one dinosaur.

09:11.551 --> 09:17.056
They originally had planned to do much
more of the texturing of the animals,

09:17.139 --> 09:20.726
procedurally with the computer
by saying, "Here is a pattern.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.937
<i>"Repeat this pattern all over the animal."</i>

09:23.020 --> 09:25.815
But the problem with that
is that it was too repetitious,

09:25.898 --> 09:28.234
it was too machine-like.

09:28.317 --> 09:31.112
We really needed some more
artistic freedom.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.781
So we went back
to designing skin texture

09:33.864 --> 09:38.286
to actually bump maps and color maps,
where an artist would actually go in

09:38.411 --> 09:40.288
<i>and paint those onto the creatures.</i>

09:40.997 --> 09:43.332
CAROLYN: <i>This is the wire frame</i>
<i>on the T. rex.</i>

09:43.457 --> 09:47.878
<i>This is how the model comes to us</i>
<i>before it's painted.</i>

09:48.004 --> 09:51.882
<i>Once this wire model is made, its skin...</i>

09:53.259 --> 09:55.553
<i>And then I put the color on the model.</i>

09:55.761 --> 09:58.055
<i>This is exactly</i>
<i>how I would go in and paint.</i>

09:58.139 --> 10:03.227
<i>I would choose my colors</i>
<i>and I painted him from toe to nose</i>

10:03.477 --> 10:06.814
<i>three times, and then went in</i>
<i>and did lot of touch-up work</i>

10:06.897 --> 10:08.065
<i>on top of that.</i>

10:08.316 --> 10:11.277
When the thing could tell a story,
and it could,

10:11.360 --> 10:15.364
the dinosaurs could have the scale,
pattern, and the color...

10:15.990 --> 10:19.285
That was the tremendous leap
forward about <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

10:21.621 --> 10:25.666
<i>So we got a sixth scale T. rex model</i>
<i>that Stan Winston had built,</i>

10:25.750 --> 10:28.169
and then we cut it up very carefully
in our shop.

10:28.252 --> 10:31.255
We got these wizards that can do
anything like that, perfect.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.341
And it's in these sections small enough

10:33.424 --> 10:36.260
to put into the laser scanner
that existed down in Monterey.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.512
We went down to a company
called Cyberware.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.390
They had the only
three-dimensional scanner.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.645
<i>And it would extract the data</i>
<i>into a polygonal data set.</i>

10:45.728 --> 10:50.358
<i>Now, polygonal data sets are 90 degree</i>
<i>crosshair section, like a ship, okay,</i>

10:50.483 --> 10:54.028
but there's no contour to it,
so you can't have proper animation.

10:54.153 --> 10:58.115
So from that we had to rebuild
all the data to have the proper contour.

11:01.494 --> 11:05.081
<i>Then we hooked on all the skin data</i>
<i>from the skin artists.</i>

11:07.208 --> 11:09.210
<i>Then did the first walking,</i>

11:09.293 --> 11:14.507
fully rendered in daylight shot,
which took us about four months to do.

11:15.841 --> 11:20.137
And Dennis went and shot a plate, I think
might even been a still in the end.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.932
DENNIS: <i>I picked the hardest design</i>
<i>I could come up with,</i>

11:23.015 --> 11:24.642
<i>which was just a static view</i>

11:24.767 --> 11:28.479
of the T. rex in broad daylight,
walking right toward you.

11:28.562 --> 11:32.525
Big, looming above you,
and Steve Williams animated it,

11:32.608 --> 11:34.860
<i>Stefen Fangmeier did the lighting on it.</i>

11:35.027 --> 11:38.989
Every opportunity to see anything wrong,
you were going to see in this test.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.825
We weren't trying to hide anything.

11:46.664 --> 11:50.584
JEAN: <i>Steve Williams invited me</i>
<i>for one of the very earliest screenings</i>

11:50.668 --> 11:53.504
<i>in the C building of the T. rex test.</i>

11:54.630 --> 11:57.550
And I was in this perceived
screening room... I think Dennis,

11:57.633 --> 12:01.512
<i>and a handful of people,</i>
<i>and I knew that I was lucky to be there.</i>

12:01.679 --> 12:05.266
This was going to be a very
interesting moment, but I had no idea.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.101
It's one thing to see little tests,

12:07.184 --> 12:10.312
you know, it's another thing
to see it rendered on the screen.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.273
(FILM REEL ROLLING)

12:17.403 --> 12:22.241
<i>And the T. rex comes thundering across</i>
<i>the screen and it's fully painted.</i>

12:22.366 --> 12:25.745
<i>I mean, it's still early days,</i>
<i>but there it was in the scene.</i>

12:26.036 --> 12:28.956
<i>And to watch that T. rex</i>
<i>coming across the screen...</i>

12:31.625 --> 12:36.547
I knew that at that moment,
I knew that visual effects

12:36.630 --> 12:38.632
would never be the same again.

12:39.258 --> 12:43.554
The thing worked, and just instantly,
it's like, everything worked.

12:43.637 --> 12:46.390
<i>The animation worked,</i>
<i>the design, the lighting worked.</i>

12:46.474 --> 12:50.686
<i>The comp worked, the sense of it</i>
<i>being standing on the ground worked,</i>

12:50.811 --> 12:55.191
the blurring on it worked. All this stuff,
because these guys are all terrific.

12:55.316 --> 13:00.154
Up until really that moment,
everything that we were doing

13:00.279 --> 13:04.241
in the model shop to create a dinosaur,
Phil's beautiful stop motion work

13:04.366 --> 13:06.952
<i>and the stuff</i>
<i>that Stan Winston's company created...</i>

13:09.413 --> 13:10.915
<i>they were all bound by gravity.</i>

13:11.040 --> 13:13.334
<i>You had to have a way</i>
<i>to support that thing</i>

13:13.417 --> 13:17.129
<i>with your wires or a pole</i>
<i>or a hand puppet or something.</i>

13:17.421 --> 13:19.673
<i>And all of a sudden I realized</i>

13:19.757 --> 13:22.927
<i>that this could exist anywhere</i>
<i>and it could do anything.</i>

13:23.177 --> 13:28.432
And I was witnessing it with a small group
of people in the C screening room,

13:28.516 --> 13:31.227
going almost weak, you know,

13:31.393 --> 13:37.149
with the amazement of it.
I'll never forget that.

13:41.403 --> 13:46.784
They did the stained glassman
for <i>Young Sherlock</i> and water snake thing

13:46.867 --> 13:51.872
in <i>The Abyss</i> and <i>Terminator 2,</i>
and I had always kind of thought

13:51.956 --> 13:55.209
well, yeah, the computer is great
for these hallucinogenic things

13:55.292 --> 13:57.711
but good luck doing a living,
breathing creature.

13:57.878 --> 14:02.049
Until he showed me the final shot
that they were going to show Spielberg,

14:02.132 --> 14:06.762
and it was like...
Whoops! (LAUGHING) Okay.

14:09.390 --> 14:14.019
My memory of Phil is he's kind of going,
"Okay, it looks pretty good."

14:14.103 --> 14:17.314
But, you know, that's just a dinosaur,
kind of taking a few steps,

14:17.398 --> 14:21.902
you know, so he was still kind of
like, okay, and but he's,

14:21.986 --> 14:23.863
you know, you can't say, it sucks.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.031
Everyone in the room's going holy (BLEEP),
you can't.

14:26.115 --> 14:29.034
You've got to, like,
accept the truth of what it is.

14:30.494 --> 14:33.330
SPAZ: <i>Then Dennis brought down</i>
<i>the film with Tippett</i>

14:33.414 --> 14:37.418
to show Steven Spielberg,
and, boom, comes on Kathleen Kennedy.

14:37.585 --> 14:41.005
This isn't a very long piece of film
that we're putting up.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.548
It's pretty quick.

14:42.631 --> 14:47.386
It was a fully rendered walking T. rex,
and they saw it and they flipped out.

14:47.595 --> 14:52.975
All of us leapt to our feet.
I mean, literally leapt to our feet.

14:53.183 --> 14:57.938
I had a kind of religious experience,

14:58.522 --> 15:00.941
and probably the greatest epiphany

15:01.025 --> 15:05.905
I've ever experienced
in my own world of making movies.

15:05.988 --> 15:10.409
That was the moment that I suddenly saw

15:10.492 --> 15:13.412
that everything was going to change.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.582
Not just my movie
was going to be a better movie,

15:16.957 --> 15:20.544
but the entire world was going
to follow in the footsteps

15:20.628 --> 15:25.633
of what Dennis Muren and Phil Tippett
and ILM were bringing to <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

15:25.758 --> 15:28.427
It was going to change
everything for all of us

15:28.510 --> 15:31.138
and for audiences everywhere.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.349
And we were never going to go back.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.977
Steven goes, "Well,
that's how we're gonna do the movie."

15:37.061 --> 15:40.481
And he was actually
a very compassionate guy.

15:40.564 --> 15:46.737
Yeah, I was putting on a brave face,
but he realized what the consequences

15:46.820 --> 15:51.575
that this were for me
and asked me how I felt,

15:51.659 --> 15:57.206
and I said, "I feel extinct,"
and he goes, "That's a great line.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.958
"I'm putting that in the movie."

16:03.128 --> 16:05.339
I think he was shell-shocked.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.633
My world had evaporated.

16:08.008 --> 16:12.179
<i>I got pneumonia.</i>
<i>I had to stay in bed for two weeks.</i>

16:12.304 --> 16:14.682
I just thought everything that I had

16:14.765 --> 16:21.355
ever worked for and built
was like... into the trash can.

16:23.273 --> 16:27.528
KATHLEEN: <i>I can't think of many other</i>
<i>moments in effects</i>

16:27.611 --> 16:30.572
where one way of doing something

16:30.656 --> 16:35.035
was so almost overnight, had changed.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.329
So when the whole thing
came down with Phil,

16:37.413 --> 16:39.039
I don't think he was very happy.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.125
And I don't blame him
because it basically was

16:41.208 --> 16:43.210
supposed to be the ultimate stop motion.

16:43.293 --> 16:47.506
It was supposed to be his opus,
you know, pretty much.

16:47.589 --> 16:52.428
Yeah. I feel like (BLEEP). And I don't
remember, all that's kind of a blur to me.

16:53.762 --> 16:57.766
<i>But then I got a call from Steven and</i>
<i>he says, "Yeah, we want you on the show,</i>

16:57.850 --> 16:59.935
"you know, you know too much."

17:00.102 --> 17:04.773
You know, so... "You never lost your job.
We'll just kick you upstairs.

17:04.857 --> 17:09.236
"You don't need to be an animator.
You just need to direct animators."

17:09.778 --> 17:16.160
He was going to go from somebody
whose hands in the craft

17:16.243 --> 17:22.207
of changing armatures, to the greatest
dinosaur whisperer in the world.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.878
DENNIS: <i>Phil knew how animals</i>
<i>moved and loved,</i>

17:25.961 --> 17:29.381
<i>and his guys that he was working with</i>
<i>were the same way, the animators.</i>

17:29.465 --> 17:32.551
We needed them moving the dinosaurs.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.888
But with a tool that could
feed it into the computer,

17:35.971 --> 17:37.931
then we could fix things
up in the computer.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.309
So we had to build this thing
that's called the D.I.D.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.187
They called the Dinosaur Input Device,
and that was basically

17:43.270 --> 17:46.857
an armature, stop-motion armature,
in the shape or the skeleton of a T. rex.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.451
PHIL: <i>It was hooked up to encoders</i>
<i>that would plug into the computer,</i>

17:57.534 --> 17:59.870
and when you move the head
of the Tyrannosaurus here,

17:59.953 --> 18:02.539
the image on the computer
screen would move.

18:05.375 --> 18:09.505
The idea to build this device,
it just seemed like a no-brainer.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.299
And I guess I had such experience at ILM,

18:12.382 --> 18:15.135
<i>you know, starting with what John Dykstra</i>
<i>had done on</i> Star Wars.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.347
<i>Just starting from scratch and doing it</i>
<i>that I had no problem</i>

18:18.430 --> 18:19.890
saying, "Let's do this."

18:19.973 --> 18:23.018
There were people at ILM
that wanted to exclude Phil,

18:23.102 --> 18:26.688
<i>but it was not going to happen</i>
<i>because the value he had needed</i>

18:26.855 --> 18:30.776
to stay within the show,
and I had my personal relationship.

18:30.859 --> 18:34.488
It was much, much better for the movie
to have Phil working it.

18:34.655 --> 18:35.781
PHIL: He roars right there.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.158
This is where he hurls it
into the skeleton.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.451
This direction so you could

18:39.535 --> 18:43.455
get the raptors on this side of his head,
get him around this...

18:43.539 --> 18:46.166
STEVEN: <i>Through Phil Tippett's</i>
<i>stop motion miniatures</i>

18:46.250 --> 18:49.920
and his on-the-set monitoring of behavior,

18:50.003 --> 18:54.174
he was going to bring life
to those animals in a different way.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.759
-He'd be wiping like...
-Yeah.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.136
Right at the camera.

18:57.219 --> 19:00.222
PHIL: <i>What I insisted</i>
<i>that the animators do</i>

19:00.347 --> 19:05.185
was imagine themselves as the dinosaur

19:05.686 --> 19:11.984
<i>to kind of, like, self-hypnotize yourself</i>
<i>into this imaginary mindset.</i>

19:12.067 --> 19:13.986
So here's how far we went...
movement classes.

19:14.069 --> 19:17.030
Okay. Ready? Focus. Get down here.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.158
Go.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.085
MARK: <i>A lot of that's Phil.</i>
<i>You get your guys,</i>

19:30.169 --> 19:31.920
<i>if you're gonna do movement of animals,</i>

19:32.004 --> 19:33.839
<i>you've got to be able</i>
<i>to move like animals.</i>

19:33.922 --> 19:36.508
<i>When I think about it,</i>
<i>it's exactly the right way to do it.</i>

19:36.592 --> 19:39.928
You just go all out.
Everyone is totally immersed in dinosaurs.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.680
We learned all about this stuff.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.270
And we got so freaked out.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.023
I remember one day we're sitting there
going, "How do we know

19:51.148 --> 19:53.901
"the way we're doing dinosaurs
will look good on film?"

19:54.193 --> 19:57.863
<i>Well, let's take 35mm film</i>
<i>of us being dinosaurs...</i>

19:59.239 --> 20:00.490
<i>and project it,</i>

20:00.574 --> 20:04.286
<i>and look at it and see what we think</i>
<i>of ourselves being dinosaurs,</i>

20:04.369 --> 20:07.456
because that might be what it looks like
when we animate them.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.291
Okay? Yeah. Why not? Why not?

20:09.750 --> 20:11.376
<i>So we go out there, we build a set,</i>

20:11.460 --> 20:14.254
<i>it's the scene where the Gallimimus</i>
<i>are running from the T. rex.</i>

20:14.338 --> 20:17.049
<i>They jump over the log and everyone's</i>
<i>supposed to be in character.</i>

20:17.132 --> 20:19.843
<i>And so Ty Ellingson, one of</i>
<i>the lead art directors on the show,</i>

20:19.927 --> 20:21.595
he's going to be the scared Gallimimus,

20:21.678 --> 20:24.431
where he stops on the log and looks back,
and then jumps off.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.934
<i>Everyone's running like...</i>
(LAUGHS) <i>a Gallimimus.</i>

20:27.017 --> 20:31.605
<i>Ty jumps the log, he slips</i>
<i>and lands and breaks his drawing arm.</i>

20:32.022 --> 20:37.527
So after that, the rule at ILM
was no more pretending you're dinosaurs.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.948
But it's all worth it
if you get the right end result.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.574
(SNARLS)

20:45.327 --> 20:48.830
-GIRL: Timmy, what is it?
-It's a Velociraptor.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.542
(BREATHES SHAKILY) It's inside.

20:52.626 --> 20:57.256
The kitchen sequence in <i>Jurassic Park,</i>
if you look at the original animatic

20:57.339 --> 21:01.009
done with little rubber puppets like this,
you know, it's been worked out.

21:03.345 --> 21:07.474
(GRUNTING)

21:08.141 --> 21:10.394
<i>I mean, there's some attitudes</i>
<i>of the dinosaurs,</i>

21:10.477 --> 21:11.853
<i>there's their performances.</i>

21:11.937 --> 21:12.980
(SNARLS)

21:13.063 --> 21:15.649
(GROWLING)

21:16.942 --> 21:19.069
You know, so much of it
was worked out already,

21:19.152 --> 21:22.990
and he had the same guys
that did those animatics

21:23.073 --> 21:25.659
<i>also did the actual performances</i>
<i>for the film</i>

21:25.826 --> 21:28.662
by moving the D.I.D. creature.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.872
(GROWLING)

21:33.375 --> 21:36.295
(SNARLING)

21:37.754 --> 21:42.759
DENNIS: <i>So their essence and soul</i>
<i>was in it, and Phil was directing it.</i>

21:42.843 --> 21:45.887
He directed the original animatics
and the other stuff, too.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.099
(GROWLING)

21:50.726 --> 21:53.937
<i>You know, the main road sequence</i>
<i>when you first see the T. rex,</i>

21:54.187 --> 21:56.023
<i>that's his guys doing that stuff.</i>

21:56.398 --> 22:00.360
<i>That stuff has got a lot</i>
<i>of powerful performance animation.</i>

22:00.610 --> 22:02.696
(ROARING)

22:02.779 --> 22:04.823
Boy, do I hate being right all the time.

22:05.907 --> 22:09.286
Early in the process, Steven said to me,

22:09.703 --> 22:15.125
um, "I need it to run."
Like that was going to be something easy.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.252
It was obviously not easy.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.213
That took me four months
to figure out that animation.

22:25.010 --> 22:29.306
<i>I had to figure out how to make</i>
<i>nine tons run 35-40 miles an hour,</i>

22:29.389 --> 22:31.058
which your eye does the math.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.310
It goes, this does not look right,
you know.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.897
MARK: <i>Fundamentally,</i>
<i>it is not natural to have</i>

22:36.980 --> 22:40.484
<i>an animal that large that</i>
<i>only has two legs,</i>

22:40.567 --> 22:42.903
whose head weighs a ton
to do all these things.

22:42.986 --> 22:45.072
So it's strange.

22:45.155 --> 22:48.241
Of course, everybody's reading,
"The T. rex never ran." Great.

22:48.367 --> 22:52.079
Well, Spielberg wants it to run.
I have to make it run.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.289
I have to make it chase a Jeep, you know?

23:03.423 --> 23:06.301
MARK: <i>So we do this animation</i>
<i>and we work on it, like, crazy,</i>

23:06.385 --> 23:07.719
<i>and Phil isn't liking it.</i>

23:07.803 --> 23:09.554
And Spielberg's kind of agreeing,

23:09.638 --> 23:12.682
and we've been beating
on this thing for weeks,

23:12.766 --> 23:14.351
and Spaz is getting depressed.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.146
<i>Every day. It wasn't looking right.</i>

23:18.271 --> 23:20.107
<i>Wasn't looking right.</i>
<i>Wasn't looking right.</i>

23:20.190 --> 23:23.360
Phil is basically saying Spaz can't do it.
What are we going to do?

23:23.443 --> 23:26.738
<i>But I'm saying Spaz can do it.</i>
<i>You guys can do it. We can do it.</i>

23:26.822 --> 23:28.448
<i>It's really getting like that.</i>

23:28.532 --> 23:29.866
There's this one last meeting,

23:30.450 --> 23:34.121
<i>Phil can point at a million things that</i>
<i>are wrong, and Steven's on the fence.</i>

23:34.204 --> 23:37.749
I can hear it. "It's pretty good. I think
you're right, but it's pretty good."

23:37.833 --> 23:40.836
SPAZ: <i>So Mark and I are looking at it</i>
<i>and it had 150 curves,</i>

23:41.044 --> 23:44.548
so I took all the curves
and I scaled them by 20%.

23:44.631 --> 23:48.009
So I wrote a little algorithm
that scaled all the curves.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.221
It just slowed the creature
down that much more.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.098
And bingo, it worked.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.356
(GROWLING)

24:02.023 --> 24:05.318
The last shot I animated was the Rex
chasing Jeff Goldblum.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.112
(DINOSAUR SCREECHING)

24:07.195 --> 24:08.655
You know, by that time I just,

24:08.738 --> 24:11.575
you know, it took me five, six days
to animate that shot.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.245
(SCREECHING)

24:15.537 --> 24:18.373
SPAZ: <i>And the guy who gets it</i>
<i>off the toilet seat, right?</i>

24:18.457 --> 24:21.460
<i>That's a T-1000 with shorts on,</i>
<i>and that's the actual data.</i>

24:22.752 --> 24:24.588
I just repurposed the data.

24:25.046 --> 24:28.133
(ROARING)

24:28.425 --> 24:34.014
When we saw the dinosaurs
that were created by the computers,

24:34.097 --> 24:39.102
I mean, I cried because I knew
the writing was on the wall. (LAUGHS)

24:39.186 --> 24:43.398
The creature shop was no more
and that digital would take over,

24:43.482 --> 24:45.650
which was George's vision all along.

24:45.817 --> 24:49.029
When we went digital,
most of the model shop

24:49.112 --> 24:50.489
just packed up and left.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.574
When that transition happened,

24:52.657 --> 24:54.534
you know, to CG, from practical,

24:54.618 --> 24:56.703
we thought it would take
a little bit longer.

24:56.786 --> 25:00.999
You know, Jim Morris one time came to us
and talk to, before the whole group.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.542
You know that the world is changing

25:02.626 --> 25:05.128
and this is going to happen,
and this is going to happen.

25:05.212 --> 25:08.632
And he called a meeting,
like, four months later, he said,

25:08.715 --> 25:13.094
"It's happening a thousand times
faster than I ever anticipated."

25:13.178 --> 25:16.223
It was a hard time because,
you know, I'd been in the trenches

25:16.306 --> 25:19.059
with all the guys,
whether it was the camera folks,

25:19.142 --> 25:21.811
the model makers, the gaffers, grips,

25:21.978 --> 25:25.982
the practical effects people.
And I loved all that stuff.

25:26.775 --> 25:30.445
So it was a wistful time at best,
and a sad time at others

25:30.529 --> 25:32.239
as that started to go away.

25:35.408 --> 25:37.661
JOHN GOODSON: <i>There was less and less work</i>
<i>for the Model Shop,</i>

25:37.744 --> 25:39.829
<i>so if you weren't going</i>
<i>to do the digital thing,</i>

25:39.913 --> 25:42.082
you weren't going
to be working full-time anymore.

25:42.165 --> 25:45.544
Some people actually made
the transition, didn't like it,

25:45.627 --> 25:47.254
and came back again.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.464
Some people just didn't want to do it.

25:52.342 --> 25:55.679
LORNE: <i>You know, I had absolutely</i>
<i>no inclination to switch to CG.</i>

25:55.845 --> 25:58.473
<i>It's not a love of mine and never was.</i>

25:58.640 --> 26:01.726
Sitting in a chair... I couldn't do it.

26:02.018 --> 26:05.480
KIM: <i>They said, "You know,</i>
<i>they're looking for another CG person</i>

26:05.605 --> 26:08.400
"to do hard surface stuff,
are you interested?"

26:08.483 --> 26:10.485
And I said, "Yeah."

26:10.569 --> 26:12.696
JOHN GOODSON: <i>Kim transitioned</i>
<i>a month ahead of me</i>

26:12.779 --> 26:16.199
and when she went, I was like,
"Okay, that's what I'm gonna do, too."

26:16.783 --> 26:20.662
It was grueling. I was exhausted.

26:20.745 --> 26:23.582
JOHN GOODSON: <i>For about six months,</i>
<i>I dreamt in pull down menus.</i>

26:23.665 --> 26:25.375
<i>People from the model shop would say,</i>

26:25.458 --> 26:27.419
"What's it like working
in computer graphics?"

26:27.502 --> 26:29.671
I said, "Well, imagine
you go into the wood shop

26:29.754 --> 26:32.215
"and you're going to cut wood.
You turn on the saw.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.509
"You put the wood down,
you start to cut it,

26:34.593 --> 26:38.305
"and the shop disappears,
and you don't know where it went.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.682
"You bang around for a few minutes
and it comes back

26:40.765 --> 26:43.018
"and the wood's cut,
and you don't know how."

26:43.101 --> 26:45.186
I said, "That's what
computer graphics is like."

26:45.270 --> 26:47.897
You can't expect everything
to stay the same.

26:47.981 --> 26:51.610
You can't expect things to be
exactly the way they were.

26:51.693 --> 26:55.697
The world changes
and the company changes and so be it.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.032
But it's still ILM.

27:03.913 --> 27:08.668
All those years
of building up the technology,

27:09.294 --> 27:14.716
finally came to this sort of a cliff thing
around this period of, like, '93

27:15.008 --> 27:18.762
when <i>Jurassic Park</i> came out,
and it's like a lot of changes

27:18.887 --> 27:20.889
in the world that
you're building up for it

27:20.972 --> 27:23.058
and you're under the radar
and supporting it,

27:23.141 --> 27:24.559
you're trying to make things work.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.519
And then all of a sudden, bam!

27:27.062 --> 27:29.481
Everything changes
in a short period of time.

27:32.859 --> 27:36.154
When I first arrived at ILM,
I worked on <i>Casper.</i>

27:38.031 --> 27:39.532
I moved to America

27:39.616 --> 27:44.245
to pursue the film business
and really to pursue that dream of ILM.

27:44.329 --> 27:47.791
I mean, it just seemed so exotic
to me and so fantastic.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.463
<i>And that was during that big bump,</i>
<i>all this explosion in the digital world.</i>

27:53.880 --> 27:56.841
-Hey, guys.
-Look, it's Casper.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.510
-Yeah, Casper.
-Casper.

27:58.593 --> 28:02.180
<i>Casper</i> had 45 minutes
of CG characters in it.

28:03.056 --> 28:06.101
ROGER: <i>It was 600 shots or 500 shots,</i>

28:06.184 --> 28:08.687
<i>which was an enormous number of shots</i>
<i>in those days</i>

28:08.770 --> 28:12.399
'cause you think of <i>Jurassic Park,</i>
whatever it is, 80 shots or something.

28:12.482 --> 28:16.361
We had to do a huge ramp up
and grow the computer graphics department.

28:16.444 --> 28:20.031
In fact, we got up to 105 people
at that point in time,

28:20.115 --> 28:24.327
which is only noteworthy because
we weren't sure there were 105 people

28:24.411 --> 28:27.706
that could do computer graphics
at that point in time.

28:27.789 --> 28:30.458
ROGER: <i>ILM had really been</i>
<i>a relatively small company</i>

28:30.542 --> 28:32.794
<i>for so many years, so they were</i>

28:32.877 --> 28:38.133
<i>really hiring on a grand scale, and it</i>
<i>turned it into a sort of a bigger machine.</i>

28:38.383 --> 28:41.970
<i>And then it sort of crept up</i>
<i>to 1,200 or 1,500 people.</i>

28:44.431 --> 28:47.851
GEORGE: <i>We spent many years</i>
<i>to develop digital technology.</i>

28:48.309 --> 28:51.938
I was designing the place
for a different kind of production.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.733
Nobody had ever harnessed it
to put in the movies,

28:55.024 --> 28:59.487
and most people didn't think it was
possible, that you just couldn't do that.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.825
<i>So we were learning</i>
<i>to use a different form</i>

29:04.701 --> 29:07.787
<i>of visual effects</i>
<i>and ways of making movies.</i>

29:07.912 --> 29:09.831
Congratulations. How do you feel?

29:10.123 --> 29:11.666
I got to pee.

29:11.791 --> 29:17.380
Now suddenly, in the short period of time,
these projects that George has initiated,

29:17.589 --> 29:18.798
the video editing...

29:19.007 --> 29:23.303
In this non-linear editor,
you can splice in, just like in film.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.263
ED: <i>In the digital audio...</i>

29:26.389 --> 29:27.891
(GROWLING)

29:28.516 --> 29:30.185
<i>In computer graphics...</i>

29:30.852 --> 29:33.146
(HOOTING AND SCREECHING)

29:33.354 --> 29:35.190
All of them come together,

29:35.273 --> 29:38.318
and the industry changes
in about a three, four year time span.

29:38.485 --> 29:41.404
And that's when I decided
I could do the next three movies.

29:46.034 --> 29:48.745
<i>I was excited to go back and go to work</i>

29:49.078 --> 29:52.665
because a lot of frustration
I had with analogs cinema is gone.

29:52.832 --> 29:55.168
How can we manage to change
the operating procedures

29:55.251 --> 29:57.378
in a way that we can
completely revolutionize

29:57.462 --> 30:00.507
the way we make movies
so that this is all doable?

30:00.673 --> 30:04.093
JOHN KNOLL: <i>I got pitched as one</i>
<i>of the sups on</i> Episode I

30:04.177 --> 30:07.222
and that was an opportunity
you do not turn down.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.598
<i>I was terrified.</i>

30:08.723 --> 30:13.561
But I comforted myself with the thought
that that must have been the same reaction

30:13.645 --> 30:17.524
that John Dykstra had
when he was first exposed to <i>Star Wars.</i>

30:18.983 --> 30:21.861
When I first arrived at ILM,
you know, my whole goal,

30:21.945 --> 30:24.572
like everybody else,
was that I want to work on <i>Star Wars,</i>

30:24.656 --> 30:26.658
<i>and I felt like my art skills</i>
<i>were so lacking.</i>

30:26.908 --> 30:29.619
<i>So I gave myself assignments</i>
<i>every day for a full week</i>

30:29.702 --> 30:33.540
<i>with the idea that the end of the week</i>
<i>I would produce a production painting.</i>

30:33.706 --> 30:36.292
And so I literally did that
for a full year.

30:36.501 --> 30:41.005
<i>And the terrific thing about that was that</i>
<i>everything that I was doing unconsciously,</i>

30:41.089 --> 30:44.551
<i>mirrored what George was doing in terms</i>
<i>of how he was designing for</i> Star Wars.

30:44.634 --> 30:45.718
<i>He was merging things.</i>

30:45.844 --> 30:49.389
<i>He was combining things, he was mixing</i>
<i>and matching, and that's when he saw</i>

30:49.472 --> 30:52.058
<i>my portfolio, and that's why he hired me</i>

30:52.141 --> 30:54.686
<i>to head up the art department</i>
<i>for the new prequels.</i>

31:01.943 --> 31:06.364
I was asked to go up to the ranch
to see the artwork that Doug Chiang had,

31:06.447 --> 31:08.658
<i>and there were these boards</i>

31:08.825 --> 31:12.287
<i>that were covered in the most</i>
<i>beautiful Doug Chiang illustrations,</i>

31:12.370 --> 31:16.040
you know, the concept art,
one after the other, after the other.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.166
He had storyboards

31:17.250 --> 31:19.878
that were pasted up
on 4x8 sheets of Foamcore.

31:20.003 --> 31:24.674
<i>Ten to a column, ten columns across.</i>
<i>And I think there were 36 boards.</i>

31:24.799 --> 31:31.139
So 3,600 storyboards,
and (CHUCKLES) almost every board

31:31.222 --> 31:33.683
<i>there was something</i>
<i>that we had never done before.</i>

31:33.766 --> 31:39.397
<i>So I was keeping notes of,</i>
<i>"Yeah, okay, we're going to need</i>

31:39.480 --> 31:43.026
<i>"to be able to do crowd scenes</i>
<i>with dozens or hundreds of characters."</i>

31:43.276 --> 31:45.194
You know, we hadn't
really done that before.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.405
<i>These are CG characters</i>
<i>that have clothing.</i>

31:47.488 --> 31:50.074
<i>We're going to have to do</i>
<i>the cloth simulation on them.</i>

31:50.158 --> 31:52.201
<i>These Jedi are slicing through droids,</i>

31:52.285 --> 31:54.787
<i>and the pieces are landing</i>
<i>on the ground, we'll need</i>

31:54.871 --> 31:56.331
<i>a rigid body dynamic system.</i>

31:56.414 --> 31:58.791
You know, we're pushing
the envelope in a few places,

31:58.875 --> 32:00.376
but I know this is going to work.

32:00.543 --> 32:03.338
The big grass planet battle there,

32:03.421 --> 32:05.340
-zillions of creatures.
-Yeah.

32:05.673 --> 32:08.718
And we don't have a real
good way of doing that right now.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.638
And it got to be a little overwhelming
'cause just as you're

32:11.721 --> 32:13.848
writing down this thing,
we're on to something else

32:13.973 --> 32:15.516
that had never been done before.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.143
And they were not just that

32:17.226 --> 32:21.230
we were doing a lot of effects,
we were creating entire worlds,

32:21.564 --> 32:23.650
<i>and many of them.</i>

32:23.816 --> 32:27.445
I had the sensation that I just wanted
to go and lie down,

32:27.612 --> 32:31.866
because it was hard to take it in
in one go like that.

32:32.742 --> 32:36.537
I remember during the production
of <i>Episode I,</i>

32:36.621 --> 32:38.790
George was often encouraging me

32:38.873 --> 32:44.420
to do things that I thought
were marginal or ill-advised.

32:46.839 --> 32:49.133
<i>There's not enough power</i>
<i>to get us to Coruscant.</i>

32:49.217 --> 32:51.719
<i>The hyperdrive is leaking.</i>
<i>We'll have to land somewhere</i>

32:51.844 --> 32:53.304
<i>and refuel and repair the ship.</i>

32:53.429 --> 32:57.392
A result of the digital technology
was that what happened in editorial

32:57.475 --> 33:00.436
was much more of a manufacturing process.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.814
You did what I called "film recomposing."

33:03.022 --> 33:04.732
GEORGE: So what I want to do is...

33:04.816 --> 33:07.902
we'll leave this for the time being
and we'll create this other shot

33:07.986 --> 33:10.655
and if this other shot works,
we'll come back to the shot,

33:10.738 --> 33:13.783
take Panaka, slip him out of sync
so he doesn't start to move.

33:13.908 --> 33:16.536
-So he's just standing there. Okay?
-Okay.

33:16.786 --> 33:21.249
You know, you've got character A
talking to character B over the shoulder,

33:21.374 --> 33:25.753
<i>and you could cut out between them and use</i>
<i>different takes that were not the takes</i>

33:25.837 --> 33:29.507
<i>that they actually talk to each other</i>
<i>because you might prefer a response</i>

33:29.590 --> 33:33.553
from somebody or a hand gesture
or something, or a blink differently.

33:33.636 --> 33:36.097
He started doing a lot of editorial comps

33:36.180 --> 33:41.060
where he would take this actor from
this plate and put him in that plate,

33:41.144 --> 33:43.604
and I'm going to drop out
this line of dialogue,

33:43.688 --> 33:45.732
so just morph it together and...

33:45.857 --> 33:50.319
John Knoll great. He was
the visual effects person on my left,

33:50.611 --> 33:54.449
and he would sit there and do,
you know, shots and things.

33:54.532 --> 33:57.869
He would just do them on his
little laptop, and all it did in the end

33:57.952 --> 34:00.788
was gain him
a whole lot of heartache. (LAUGHS)

34:00.872 --> 34:02.832
Because then I relied on him
for everything.

34:02.915 --> 34:07.503
He was doing all these things that,
boy, I wouldn't have chosen to do that.

34:07.587 --> 34:12.341
I said, "Let's do this. Let's do that."
And he would always be going, "Oh, God."

34:12.425 --> 34:14.469
I said, "Just try it, see what happens."

34:14.552 --> 34:16.721
I said, "Yeah,
but the lighting doesn't match.

34:16.804 --> 34:19.182
"And the perspective,
it's the wrong focal length and..."

34:19.265 --> 34:20.475
Just try it.

34:20.767 --> 34:24.312
I know you're in pain,
I recognize you're in pain.

34:24.854 --> 34:27.690
And I appreciate your pain,
but let's do it.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.484
All right. Let me see what I can do.

34:29.567 --> 34:32.445
And you'd go in and you do
the best job of it you can.

34:32.695 --> 34:36.949
JOHN KNOLL: The main things here,
we have the walking hologram generator,

34:37.033 --> 34:38.743
which will be added in computer graphic.

34:38.826 --> 34:43.414
We have a matte painting of Theed City
to put back there, and the light fixtures

34:43.539 --> 34:47.043
on the hall in the hallway
are not what George wants.

34:47.126 --> 34:49.378
So we're going to replace them
with something else.

34:49.462 --> 34:52.256
So it's a relatively straightforward shot.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.884
And it actually turned out
better than I thought.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.844
<i>But now when I'm on a...</i>

34:56.928 --> 35:00.056
<i>I would think of as a more</i>
<i>normal production, and you'd say,</i>

35:00.223 --> 35:03.935
"If we just take that guy from that plate,
we can split that in there,

35:04.102 --> 35:07.188
"and that'll be fine."
And the director will go, "Really?

35:07.271 --> 35:09.899
"You can do that?"
I said, "Yeah, we did stuff

35:09.982 --> 35:11.901
"way dumber than that on <i>Star Wars."</i>

35:13.986 --> 35:18.616
George, especially the time that I joined,
when it was his film that we were making,

35:18.783 --> 35:21.327
he was really pushing us
to do something different.

35:21.452 --> 35:25.414
I knew I could use those films to make
people believe that digital cinema works.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.793
George has always had a intense curiosity

35:28.876 --> 35:33.673
for innovating filmmaking technique
and production methodologies.

35:33.756 --> 35:35.466
The film industry was so calcified

35:35.550 --> 35:37.677
that that was,
they were going to stay that way.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.846
And it took a lot to get them to change.

35:42.849 --> 35:48.229
<i>We went to Sony, who was building</i>
<i>a high-def television camera,</i>

35:48.437 --> 35:51.065
and we said, "It has to go
24 frames a second.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.067
"It can't go 30 frames a second."

35:53.609 --> 35:55.528
They said, "That's really hard."

35:55.820 --> 35:59.073
So after a lot of talking,
we convinced them to do it.

36:02.952 --> 36:05.997
<i>I was a persona non grata</i>
<i>in the film industry.</i>

36:06.164 --> 36:09.125
The Camera Guild was out to get me.

36:09.458 --> 36:12.545
<i>They wrote terrible editorials about me.</i>

36:12.670 --> 36:15.506
JOHN KNOLL: <i>There were some</i>
<i>that were probably worried or defensive</i>

36:15.590 --> 36:18.176
that this was gonna put them out of work.

36:18.342 --> 36:21.512
GEORGE: <i>We got the cameras finished,</i>
<i>but we couldn't find</i>

<i>a lens that would go on it</i>
<i>because it was a very</i>

36:24.849 --> 36:27.018
<i>different area that had to be covered.</i>

36:27.476 --> 36:31.272
And so I went to Panavision
and they said, "We'll do it."

36:31.898 --> 36:34.108
<i>So when we got to</i> Attack of the Clones,

36:34.233 --> 36:36.235
<i>we were able to shoot</i>
<i>the whole thing digitally.</i>

36:36.319 --> 36:40.114
-Okay, cut. Okay. That was good.
-Cut that!

36:40.573 --> 36:41.574
That was beautiful.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.411
Then we had to go to Texas Instruments,

36:45.661 --> 36:48.164
<i>who was starting to build</i>
<i>digital projectors.</i>

36:48.289 --> 36:51.042
MAN: <i>The projector</i>
<i>stores images electronically,</i>

36:51.125 --> 36:52.710
<i>they're shot through</i>
<i>a special chip</i>

36:52.793 --> 36:55.129
<i>that packs over a million tiny mirrors.</i>

36:55.379 --> 36:58.799
<i>They reflect colors in different ways</i>
<i>to make pictures on a screen.</i>

36:58.883 --> 37:01.385
GEORGE: <i>But in order to get the theaters</i>
<i>to get the projector,</i>

37:01.469 --> 37:02.845
<i>we had to give them projectors.</i>

37:02.929 --> 37:05.223
And they cost around $100,000 apiece.

37:05.306 --> 37:09.060
So we just gave 'em to them for a while
until they got used to them.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.480
<i>It all may cost more,</i>
<i>so the industry may need convincing.</i>

37:12.563 --> 37:14.357
I remember, early days,

37:14.440 --> 37:17.068
he had so much resistance,
like, "No, no way.

37:17.151 --> 37:18.486
"Digital projectors? No way."

37:18.569 --> 37:21.364
Even though we saw the results,
there were no scratches

37:21.447 --> 37:23.491
<i>and the clarity was so much better.</i>

37:24.617 --> 37:28.329
GEORGE: <i>The Theater Owners Association</i>
<i>was saying that we were like drug dealers.</i>

37:28.412 --> 37:31.582
Once they get you hooked on this,
you'll never get off and all that.

37:31.666 --> 37:32.917
It was really a bad time.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.461
(CROWD CHEERING)

37:35.836 --> 37:37.255
<i>But when we did the first one,</i>

37:37.338 --> 37:40.424
Phantom Menace <i>went out</i>
<i>in four digital theaters.</i>

37:40.675 --> 37:44.136
The next film went out in 200 theaters.

37:45.513 --> 37:48.391
<i>Eventually, we got</i>
<i>to the point where, you know,</i>

37:48.516 --> 37:52.270
<i>almost half of the theaters</i>
<i>in America were digital.</i>

37:54.647 --> 38:00.820
I was working at an AMC movie theater
when the original prequel films came out.

38:05.074 --> 38:09.495
This is right before I realize
I want to become a filmmaker.

38:09.662 --> 38:12.665
(BEEPING AND WHOOSHING)

38:15.960 --> 38:18.879
<i>And every time I was</i>
<i>working in an auditorium</i>

38:18.963 --> 38:21.549
<i>and that came on, I would just</i>
<i>stop what I was doing</i>

38:21.632 --> 38:23.259
<i>and I would just get lost in it.</i>

38:23.342 --> 38:26.345
And at that point in time,
the fight scenes were magnificent.

38:26.429 --> 38:27.471
And I must admit...

38:31.726 --> 38:35.646
<i>seeing Yoda wield the light saber</i>
<i>and fight was magnificent.</i>

38:36.397 --> 38:40.359
And so I think at that point
it was just about scale and spectacle.

38:45.948 --> 38:48.659
<i>It was just epic,</i>
<i>you know, it was just epic.</i>

38:49.869 --> 38:52.163
I couldn't make one,
two and three without digital.

38:52.246 --> 38:55.416
I couldn't do any of that stuff.
I mean, those are giant movies.

38:55.499 --> 38:58.294
A lot of things changed at ILM
as a result of all of that.

38:58.377 --> 39:02.757
In fact, I think that the changes
were way beyond the company.

39:02.882 --> 39:06.135
They changed filmmaking more generally.

<i>of geniuses at ILM made.</i>

39:23.069 --> 39:25.821
Like digital cameras, digital compositing.

39:25.905 --> 39:28.616
There's so many things.
It's like Menlo Park.

CHRISSIE: <i>The National Medal of Technology</i>
<i>was really a recognition</i>

You know, his company
receiving something like that.

40:10.574 --> 40:15.704

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

40:18.416 --> 40:20.376
JON: <i>George has innovated so much.</i>

40:21.377 --> 40:24.338
<i>I grew up in Queens in the '70s and '80s,</i>

40:24.422 --> 40:28.342
<i>and as I watched films, I was right</i>
<i>in the sweet spot of practical effects</i>

40:28.551 --> 40:31.887
in the films of Spielberg
and Lucas and ILM, all of it.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.395
<i>So I'm kind of patient zero</i>

40:39.603 --> 40:44.400
<i>for what impression that world</i>
<i>made upon a generation.</i>

40:44.733 --> 40:47.361
And because of that,
I didn't really like CGI.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.033
And it was on <i>Iron Man</i> working with ILM,

40:53.117 --> 40:56.912
<i>I really began to trust that</i>
<i>CGI could live up</i>

40:56.996 --> 41:00.958
to the promise of what was presented
back in <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

41:02.585 --> 41:07.465
HAL: <i>Jon came in as someone who was</i>
<i>pretty openly skeptical of CG effects,</i>

41:07.548 --> 41:09.550
and that was fine, you know.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.927
I think that served us well, actually.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.014
JON: <i>I was shooting a real suit</i>
<i>that Stan Winston built,</i>

41:15.097 --> 41:16.682
<i>and then we would also have a CG suit</i>

41:16.765 --> 41:19.268
because there were certain things
a suit couldn't do.

41:19.351 --> 41:21.395
HAL: <i>Starting into it,</i>
<i>everyone was very keen,</i>

41:21.479 --> 41:24.648
<i>including Robert to have him</i>
<i>in the real suit whenever possible.</i>

41:24.732 --> 41:26.901
You know, obviously,
because you built this thing.

41:27.026 --> 41:28.694
It's beautiful. You should use it.

41:28.777 --> 41:32.615
But it was so limiting in its movements
that Robert, I think,

41:32.698 --> 41:37.369
very quickly embraced the pajamas
with markers that we gave him for

41:37.495 --> 41:39.622
<i>when we were going to do CG.</i>
<i>He was all for it</i>

41:39.705 --> 41:44.502
once he realized, "I can just
wear this and it's going to look great."

41:46.462 --> 41:50.299
We started figuring out in shots
when to use pieces of the practical suit

41:50.382 --> 41:52.676
<i>and finish the rest of it in CG.</i>

41:53.761 --> 41:58.140
Because it was a mix,
hopefully the audience, never quite sure.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.102
<i>"Is Robert Downey wearing that?</i>

42:02.186 --> 42:04.104
<i>"Or is that? Well, that can't be,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

42:04.188 --> 42:06.982
<i>"all those mechanisms underneath.</i>
<i>I guess that's CG."</i>

42:07.691 --> 42:09.610
But, boy, that surface sure looks like

42:09.735 --> 42:11.946
it's something I could touch,
and that's part of it.

42:12.071 --> 42:15.866
If the audience just looks at something
and immediately understands in their brain

42:15.950 --> 42:19.578
what it would feel like to put their
hand on it, then you're halfway there.

42:19.703 --> 42:23.207
And lights, and action.

42:23.290 --> 42:26.752
HAL: <i>There was a point when we were midway</i>
<i>through a review on the shot,</i>

42:26.877 --> 42:30.506
<i>and Jon was making a comment</i>
<i>about something in the real suit,</i>

42:30.673 --> 42:35.261
and we said, "Well, actually,
it's all CG now. The whole thing is CG."

42:35.427 --> 42:37.638
I was giving notes on the practical suit.

42:37.805 --> 42:40.933
In other words, I couldn't tell
which was the digital suit

42:41.016 --> 42:44.144
<i>and which was the real suit,</i>
<i>the real one that we had sculpted.</i>

42:44.228 --> 42:46.105
And he's like, "Great. I didn't know that.

42:46.188 --> 42:48.566
"All right, well,
then I think we're good here." (LAUGHING)

42:48.649 --> 42:50.985
It's looking good,
anything else to look at?

42:51.110 --> 42:54.530
JON: <i>And that's when I knew that</i>
<i>I could really trust CGI,</i>

42:54.613 --> 42:56.657
that they were holding a standard

42:56.740 --> 42:59.952
that was going to not distract
from the storytelling.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.038
Harper.

43:04.582 --> 43:05.958
KEN: <i>Digital really opens up</i>

43:06.041 --> 43:08.752
a whole different type of movie
that could be done.

43:08.877 --> 43:12.715
Some movies are designed to be invisible
visual effects.

43:12.798 --> 43:14.216
<i>Forrest Gump</i> has a lot of that.

43:16.135 --> 43:19.305
<i>And if it carries an audience through</i>
<i>with an exciting moment</i>

43:19.638 --> 43:22.016
that blends beautifully in
with the live action,

43:22.099 --> 43:23.475
that's what it's about.

43:23.559 --> 43:25.686
There are two big threads of

43:25.769 --> 43:28.272
digital technology that have blossomed up,
you know.

43:28.355 --> 43:32.776
The big effects ones and then the ones
that every film can use a little bit of,

43:32.860 --> 43:35.821
and you don't even know there's stuff
there a lot of the time.

43:45.247 --> 43:47.958
When I came to do
<i>The Underground Railroad,</i> I thought,

43:48.042 --> 43:50.919
"I don't want CGI trains,
I don't want CGI tunnels."

43:54.506 --> 43:58.510
<i>It would be a tragedy</i>
<i>if you're watching this thing,</i>

43:58.594 --> 44:03.057
and the thing you notice most
is the artifice of the creation.

44:03.140 --> 44:06.310
So I felt like there was
a degree of realism

44:06.435 --> 44:08.145
that we wanted to approach.

44:08.771 --> 44:10.898
<i>ILM and all these wonderful artists</i>

44:10.981 --> 44:15.986
<i>are capable of really taking</i>
<i>this image to this place</i>

44:16.153 --> 44:19.281
<i>beyond artifice to this place of realism.</i>

44:20.449 --> 44:23.243
I love that some people watch
<i>The Underground Railroad,</i>

44:23.327 --> 44:25.204
which is 10 hours of trains and fire,

44:25.287 --> 44:28.165
and they go, "Yeah, and there's
very few visual effects, right?"

44:28.332 --> 44:31.877
I'm like... (CHUCKLING) "Thank you.

44:32.086 --> 44:33.837
"And I would tell the folks at ILM,

44:33.962 --> 44:37.883
"You said that, but there are tons
of effects, tons of effects."

44:37.966 --> 44:40.094
Sometimes you want it to be,
this is going to be

44:40.177 --> 44:41.887
the best thing you're ever going to see.

44:41.970 --> 44:44.264
Sometimes you want to be
like nothing to see here.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.141
Oh, my God, that's so great.

44:46.225 --> 44:48.727
But at the end of the day,
it's a big shell game, right?

44:48.811 --> 44:52.606
So sometimes it's the story you're telling
when you're moving the shells around.

44:53.190 --> 44:55.192
ROB: <i>Just doing something</i>
<i>that's impossible</i>

44:55.275 --> 44:57.486
<i>used to be enough to impress somebody.</i>

44:57.569 --> 45:00.197
<i>Now, the driving force has to be something</i>

45:00.280 --> 45:02.616
that's more intrinsically
tied to the storytelling,

45:02.700 --> 45:04.702
and the parts of the story
you really care about.

45:04.785 --> 45:06.495
Because just the magic trick on its own,

45:06.578 --> 45:10.290
people either know how it's done, or they
at least think they know how it's done.

45:10.374 --> 45:11.375
We care about humans.

45:11.458 --> 45:15.129
We think we like all of this digital stuff
and this visual effects stuff,

45:15.212 --> 45:17.214
and it's interesting,
but at the end of the day

45:17.297 --> 45:19.466
you really got to see another human.

45:19.591 --> 45:22.636
ROB: <i>So we wanted to bring more</i>
<i>of the environment, live on set,</i>

45:22.803 --> 45:26.181
so the actors had to act against
and the camera could actually see it.

45:28.308 --> 45:31.270
<i>And</i> The Mandalorian
<i>was really the opportunity</i>

45:31.353 --> 45:33.480
<i>where we got to take all those ideas...</i>

45:36.233 --> 45:38.610
and build it out at the largest scale.

45:38.861 --> 45:41.947
The technology was there.
Using newly available hardware,

45:42.114 --> 45:45.534
<i>these fast video cards for gaming,</i>
<i>these really good screens,</i>

45:45.617 --> 45:49.538
<i>and motion capture technology,</i>
<i>so you had positional data on the camera.</i>

45:49.621 --> 45:51.749
We made what we called the volume.

45:53.417 --> 45:55.794
<i>Because that's what they call</i>
<i>a motion capture volume.</i>

45:55.878 --> 45:58.630
<i>It wasn't like we coined it.</i>
<i>We were just using that term.</i>

45:58.839 --> 46:02.134
ROB: <i>And the basic idea is,</i>
<i>what if you had a perfect screen</i>

46:02.217 --> 46:05.888
that surrounded you almost 360 degrees
above you and all of your sides

46:05.971 --> 46:10.434
<i>and you could make any digital environment</i>
<i>that you wanted to create on that wall.</i>

46:11.101 --> 46:14.354
<i>It's thousands of these small patches</i>
<i>that make up a seamless wall,</i>

46:14.438 --> 46:15.898
and it's really kind of amazing.

46:15.981 --> 46:18.233
You can't even tell that
they're individual screens.

46:18.317 --> 46:21.403
It's just a continuous surface
to your eye and to the camera.

46:23.489 --> 46:26.241
It turned it from a system
of having to do blue screen

46:26.325 --> 46:28.577
or green screen composites
on everything to a system

46:28.660 --> 46:32.080
<i>where what you see on the day</i>
<i>is what you get in the show.</i>

46:34.374 --> 46:36.001
You can be anywhere in the world.

46:36.084 --> 46:40.672
So if you want to be in Iceland one day,
and you want to be in the desert the next,

46:40.756 --> 46:44.051
<i>you can literally change between</i>
<i>those locations with a button click</i>

46:44.134 --> 46:47.054
<i>back at the computer</i>
<i>that's driving the volume.</i>

46:47.137 --> 46:49.181
The real trick to what we're doing is that

46:49.264 --> 46:52.184
as the camera moves inside of this volume,

46:52.267 --> 46:55.729
<i>there are little cameras</i>
<i>all around the volume itself</i>

46:55.854 --> 46:58.315
<i>that are paying attention</i>
<i>to where it's moving,</i>

46:58.398 --> 47:01.401
<i>and then correcting</i>
<i>the image on the screen</i>

47:01.485 --> 47:06.740
<i>so that the perspective of the image that</i>
<i>is being seen by the camera is correct.</i>

47:06.907 --> 47:11.203
The parallax is locked in it perfect.
Your brain tells you it's real.

47:11.328 --> 47:15.874
Half the set might be made
practically, real props on the set,

47:16.208 --> 47:18.085
<i>extend that off</i>
<i>into the distance digitally,</i>

47:18.168 --> 47:19.962
<i>and when you look at it</i>
<i>through the camera,</i>

47:20.045 --> 47:21.964
it just looks like it's completely real.

47:22.047 --> 47:25.759
JON: <i>The cinematographer loved it because</i>
<i>you could actually compose your own shots.</i>

47:25.843 --> 47:28.053
<i>You weren't trusting it later</i>
<i>to a cop artist.</i>

47:28.136 --> 47:30.097
I remember the guy from the studio came

47:30.180 --> 47:32.724
<i>and he says, "I thought</i>
<i>you weren't building a set.</i>

47:32.891 --> 47:35.143
<i>"I thought we already,</i>
<i>we installed the screens.</i>

47:35.227 --> 47:36.770
<i>"We invested all that money."</i>

47:36.854 --> 47:38.856
<i>And I was like, "That's just the desk.</i>

47:38.981 --> 47:41.191
(LAUGHS) "That's just the desk
and some boxes."

47:41.358 --> 47:43.694
He didn't realize
that we were in the volume.

47:43.819 --> 47:45.195
<i>It was all projected.</i>

47:50.033 --> 47:53.829
DEBORAH: <i>The first day I went in for</i>
<i>an interview, actually, for</i> Mandalorian,

47:54.037 --> 47:56.832
I didn't even know
what I was going to the meeting for.

47:57.082 --> 47:58.625
<i>And then Jon walked in,</i>

47:58.709 --> 48:02.629
and I was like, "Oh." (CHUCKLES)
"Nobody had told me this at all."

48:02.754 --> 48:05.340
And then within five minutes,
I was in a VR headset,

48:05.424 --> 48:07.634
<i>flying around one of the sets</i>
<i>for</i> Mandalorian,

48:07.718 --> 48:09.219
<i>one of the early prototypes.</i>

48:09.303 --> 48:12.806
Jon told me later actually
that it was also his way of kind of seeing

48:12.890 --> 48:15.976
how quickly I would adapt to it
or how techie I was, basically.

48:16.059 --> 48:17.519
It was really quite simple for me

48:17.603 --> 48:19.980
because I had played enough
PlayStation in my life

48:20.063 --> 48:23.150
that the controllers are very similar,
so I got it pretty fast.

48:26.653 --> 48:30.240
<i>Mandalorian</i> was a very different
process for me

48:30.324 --> 48:33.118
because it was like no TV show
that I'd ever worked on.

48:34.369 --> 48:38.624
<i>We were working very closely with</i>
<i>all the ILM team, right from the get-go,</i>

48:38.707 --> 48:41.418
<i>about how we're articulating things,</i>
<i>how we're building sets.</i>

48:41.501 --> 48:45.631
So everybody had to collaborate in a way
that I've never seen happen before.

48:45.756 --> 48:47.841
Just because the nature of the technology

48:47.925 --> 48:50.552
and the dependence of people
knowing what each other are doing.

48:50.636 --> 48:53.221
Like, you'd have something like,
set dec creating something,

48:53.305 --> 48:54.723
<i>but then it has to be photographed</i>

48:54.806 --> 48:57.100
because it'll be on the volume
and you've got it both

48:57.184 --> 48:59.686
as a practical element
and a visual effects element.

49:00.729 --> 49:03.273
KATHLEEN: <i>What's happening with something</i>
<i>like the volume</i>

49:03.357 --> 49:08.278
and what we're doing with <i>Mandalorian</i> is
by taking that post process,

49:08.362 --> 49:12.407
the creation of those images
that usually we wouldn't see

49:12.491 --> 49:14.493
until months after shooting,

49:14.743 --> 49:17.913
<i>and moving that</i>
<i>to the beginning of the process.</i>

49:18.038 --> 49:20.999
WOMAN: All right, nice and quiet
all around, please, here we go.

49:21.083 --> 49:22.250
And play back!

49:22.542 --> 49:27.005
KATHLEEN: <i>With actors who are being</i>
<i>directed by the director,</i>

49:27.172 --> 49:30.676
<i>with something they can see</i>
<i>and actually experience,</i>

49:30.759 --> 49:33.095
I think you're getting back
to real filmmaking.

49:33.178 --> 49:35.806
ROB: <i>When you get all the departments</i>
<i>working on something</i>

49:35.889 --> 49:40.102
<i>that you have in camera on the day,</i>
<i>you bring back the expertise</i>

49:40.185 --> 49:44.314
to the filmmaking process on the day
and you get these wonderful coincidences.

49:44.398 --> 49:47.943
You get opportunities because
you have everything there on the day.

49:48.026 --> 49:50.362
Because you have
to make decisions up front,

49:50.529 --> 49:53.281
<i>and you're using visual effects</i>
<i>techniques and tools</i>

49:53.407 --> 49:55.701
<i>as part of your principal photography,</i>

49:55.784 --> 50:01.206
it changes the process, and you do have
to be very judicious with your decisions.

50:01.331 --> 50:05.127
And I actually think that that ends up
with a better end result.

50:06.378 --> 50:08.422
In traditional model building
and photography,

50:08.505 --> 50:11.591
you get happy accidents,
and those are things you can't capture.

50:11.675 --> 50:12.801
You can't invent that.

50:12.884 --> 50:16.388
But now, when you combine the two,
you can get the best of both worlds.

50:18.348 --> 50:20.350
<i>On many of our shows, we would always say,</i>

50:20.434 --> 50:23.603
<i>"Well, can we do this traditionally?</i>
<i>Can we actually have a model shop?</i>

50:23.687 --> 50:25.480
<i>"Can we build a model and photograph it?"</i>

50:25.564 --> 50:27.941
And we would always get pushed back.

50:28.066 --> 50:30.944
<i>And the difference for</i> The Mandalorian
<i>was that Jon loved it.</i>

50:31.028 --> 50:33.071
JOHN GOODSON: <i>Jon wanted</i>
<i>to build a practical model</i>

50:33.155 --> 50:34.448
<i>for</i> The Mandalorian <i>TV series.</i>

50:34.531 --> 50:36.533
I get this phone call about once a year,

50:36.616 --> 50:40.412
and it sounds great and all that stuff,
but, whatever. It never happens.

50:41.621 --> 50:43.915
<i>And then it actually happened.</i>

50:44.207 --> 50:45.751
<i>They did a 3D print,</i>

50:45.876 --> 50:48.962
<i>which was like getting a deck of cards,</i>
<i>was like 50 little pieces.</i>

50:49.463 --> 50:50.464
<i>Put it all together.</i>

50:50.589 --> 50:53.508
<i>It built a two-foot model,</i>
<i>and it was so cool.</i>

50:53.633 --> 50:56.053
And then John Knoll
built a motion-control system.

50:56.970 --> 51:01.224
Next thing I know, I'm hearing that
John Knoll is building a rig.

51:01.308 --> 51:04.561
Now, we didn't ask him to build a rig.
This wasn't part of the pitch.

51:04.644 --> 51:06.188
The pitch was, "Could we do a shot?"

51:06.313 --> 51:08.190
<i>He starts doing it</i>
<i>like he's in the AV club,</i>

51:08.273 --> 51:11.359
<i>in the basement at ILM, at LDAC,</i>
<i>and he's making this thing,</i>

51:11.443 --> 51:14.863
<i>and next thing you know, everybody's</i>
<i>coming around to see what it is,</i>

51:14.946 --> 51:17.824
because, you know,
it's like Tom Sawyer painting the fence.

51:17.949 --> 51:20.660
<i>So that's what's making</i> The Mandalorian
<i>feel like</i> Star Wars,

51:20.744 --> 51:24.122
is we're inheriting this legacy,
this energy.

51:27.167 --> 51:29.419
<i>And that shot was glorious.</i>

51:34.007 --> 51:38.929
That's really what I appreciate most
about George Lucas specifically.

51:39.012 --> 51:44.518
But this whole generation of filmmakers
is that there was an eye to the past

51:44.601 --> 51:47.521
and an eye to the future
and into innovation.

51:49.689 --> 51:53.193
KATHLEEN: <i>Jon Favreau</i>
<i>and Dave Filoni and I,</i>

51:53.401 --> 51:55.987
<i>from the moment we started talking about</i>

51:56.113 --> 51:59.241
creating the volume,
all we did was talk about George.

52:01.493 --> 52:06.081
<i>Because he was already anticipating</i>
<i>a lot of what we've ended up doing.</i>

52:21.096 --> 52:24.015
The first thing he did when he walked on
was he was like,

52:24.099 --> 52:27.352
"Hey, this is what I've been trying
to tell everybody we had to do."

52:27.435 --> 52:28.812
(CHUCKLING) Very George.

52:29.896 --> 52:34.609
<i>But I think he was incredibly thrilled</i>
<i>to see that it was actually being done</i>

52:34.693 --> 52:37.404
<i>in the way that he did</i>
<i>envision in his mind,</i>

52:37.612 --> 52:41.032
and anything that pushes
digital filmmaking,

52:41.241 --> 52:43.618
<i>that is so near and dear to his heart.</i>

52:48.248 --> 52:50.750
JON: <i>What he was able to achieve</i>
<i>with a lot of time and money</i>

52:50.834 --> 52:54.379
with the prequels, we were able to do
on a TV schedule and budget

52:54.462 --> 52:57.841
<i>because we were afforded all of that</i>
<i>through the technological innovations</i>

52:57.924 --> 52:59.676
<i>that had happened since he had done that.</i>

53:08.310 --> 53:10.770
So when he comes in,
it feels like a satisfying thing

53:10.854 --> 53:14.482
because finally, what he
saw in his head, we could do.

53:20.572 --> 53:22.866
LYNWEN: <i>The thing that I love</i>
<i>about the industry</i>

53:22.949 --> 53:25.285
<i>is that we are always doing something new.</i>

53:25.368 --> 53:29.664
<i>Therefore, you have to have</i>
<i>an affinity for danger.</i>

53:29.748 --> 53:31.958
<i>You have to have</i>
<i>an affinity for taking risks.</i>

53:32.042 --> 53:36.421
You have to not be scared of that
and actually be energized by that.

53:37.005 --> 53:40.342
<i>And that unique passion in the way</i>

53:40.425 --> 53:44.554
<i>that we are pushing the industry</i>
<i>is still there.</i>

53:44.638 --> 53:48.225
That's the thing that
always strikes me about ILM.

53:48.308 --> 53:51.269
It's like this brain
that is always thinking. (CHUCKLES)

53:51.603 --> 53:53.813
Industrial Light and Magic

53:55.232 --> 53:58.693
is the three key ingredients to

54:00.070 --> 54:02.822
a film, a successful film,

54:02.948 --> 54:07.327
and George encapsulated it
in those three words.

54:07.410 --> 54:09.829
It's an industry.
Things have to be done on time.

54:09.913 --> 54:12.999
They have to be done for a price.
There has to be pragmatism.

54:13.083 --> 54:16.962
And then the light. Of course,
this is that we are shining the light,

54:17.045 --> 54:19.923
and it isn't just light on the screen.

54:20.298 --> 54:21.883
It's light in our lives.

54:21.967 --> 54:24.761
And the magic is the innovation

54:24.886 --> 54:28.848
that we do at the company,
both in terms of art and science.

54:29.099 --> 54:33.270
It's super ingrained in the culture
and will continue for a long time.

54:41.403 --> 54:44.406
<i>There's no other visual effects company</i>
<i>that's been around as long,</i>

54:44.489 --> 54:47.826
and so they always had this connectivity
all the way back to, you know,

54:47.909 --> 54:53.039
<i>these guys setting up shop in a warehouse</i>
<i>in Van Nuys in '75 to make</i> Star Wars.

54:54.207 --> 54:56.668
It felt like there were all these elements

54:56.793 --> 54:59.796
that came together
to put me in this situation

54:59.879 --> 55:01.548
<i>that can never be repeated.</i>

55:02.590 --> 55:05.051
A lot of chance things came together.

55:05.302 --> 55:09.431
<i>But at heart, it was also because</i>
<i>George wanted to make it happen.</i>

55:09.889 --> 55:12.684
He knew he had a problem.
He didn't know how to solve it.

55:12.892 --> 55:16.021
<i>But he knew "If I take this person</i>
<i>and that person and this person,</i>

55:16.146 --> 55:18.690
<i>"I put them together,</i>
<i>maybe I'll get to the solution."</i>

55:18.773 --> 55:23.153
The whole process was like,
"I got a job in the circus,"

55:23.278 --> 55:26.031
(LAUGHS) <i>you know,</i>
<i>and that's what I wanted to do.</i>

55:26.489 --> 55:28.950
I don't care, I'll clean up
the elephants (BLEEP).

55:29.034 --> 55:31.870
Or you know, whatever, you know,
I just want to be there.

55:32.746 --> 55:36.708
DENNIS: <i>There was something here about</i>
<i>the people and the spirit and, you know,</i>

55:36.791 --> 55:40.253
<i>the source of where we came from</i>
<i>and why we're here, and the talent,</i>

55:40.879 --> 55:43.923
and the mixture of art and technology.

55:44.507 --> 55:46.801
KEN: <i>Being around such a talented group,</i>

55:47.218 --> 55:51.181
feeding off of them, getting stuff from
them and then trying to give stuff back.

55:51.848 --> 55:55.935
LYNWEN: <i>I really feel that</i>
<i>the original team of rebels</i>

55:56.102 --> 55:57.896
<i>that George pulled together</i>

55:58.271 --> 56:03.318
that had the audacity to think
that his vision was possible,

56:03.777 --> 56:05.445
<i>that still lives.</i>

56:05.528 --> 56:09.616
<i>This idea that just because it hasn't</i>
<i>been done, doesn't mean it can't be done.</i>

56:11.242 --> 56:15.663
JEAN: <i>That's what makes ILM what it is.</i>
<i>I believe we all feel that.</i>

56:17.290 --> 56:20.543
That we can do anything.
And I don't know that there's ever

56:20.668 --> 56:24.756
<i>been another collection of people</i>
<i>that could say that with such conviction.</i>

56:24.839 --> 56:28.510
Working with ILM is like working with,
you know, I don't know, Marlon Brando

56:28.593 --> 56:32.389
or someone, early Brando.
But like, you're going to do the best

56:32.472 --> 56:34.641
<i>you can to work with them,</i>
<i>collaborate with them.</i>

56:34.724 --> 56:37.018
<i>But they're</i> (BLEEP) <i>Marlon Brando.</i>

56:39.437 --> 56:43.483
ILM is full of these people
who are geniuses

56:43.733 --> 56:47.529
<i>and are pushing the envelope all the time.</i>

56:48.571 --> 56:51.491
One of the things I loved so much
about working there is that there was

56:51.574 --> 56:54.536
<i>a whole studio full of people</i>
<i>that were more talented,</i>

56:54.619 --> 56:56.579
<i>smarter and more experienced than I was,</i>

56:56.663 --> 56:58.832
<i>that I could draw on and be inspired by.</i>

56:59.290 --> 57:03.545
<i>There wasn't a day either on the set</i>

57:03.837 --> 57:06.714
or painting that I didn't learn something.

57:06.923 --> 57:10.510
ILM was like, you know,
as much of a job as it was a school.

57:11.052 --> 57:15.807
<i>I'll never graduate from ILM</i>
<i>and I'll never leave the halls of ILM.</i>

57:15.890 --> 57:18.893
It made the way that I thought okay.

57:18.977 --> 57:20.687
JEAN: <i>It was a playground,</i>

57:20.895 --> 57:23.773
<i>and I looked forward</i>
<i>every day to going to work.</i>

57:24.107 --> 57:26.818
My favorite place is
to be on the edge of discovery.

57:26.901 --> 57:28.778
That's the best feeling in the world.

57:28.862 --> 57:31.948
I want to work with people
that inspire me, that push me.

57:32.031 --> 57:34.617
<i>I think that is the spirit of ILM...</i>

57:35.702 --> 57:38.163
that is inherent in everybody
that I've met there.

57:38.246 --> 57:41.166
RON: <i>It's always sleeves rolled up,</i>
<i>and "Here's what we're thinking."</i>

57:41.291 --> 57:43.793
"What are you thinking?"
"Here's what we think we can do."

57:43.877 --> 57:44.919
<i>"Let's talk."</i>

57:46.963 --> 57:49.424
<i>And it goes back to that original group,</i>

57:49.966 --> 57:52.844
that were just unpretentious,
yet brilliant people.

57:53.720 --> 57:56.639
PHIL: <i>You work on a lot of movies</i>
<i>through your lifetime.</i>

57:56.764 --> 58:01.561
<i>You know, you'll be lucky</i>
<i>if you work on two or three that are,</i>

58:01.644 --> 58:04.063
you know, hugely successful to the public.

58:04.439 --> 58:08.860
<i>But what you walk away with</i>
<i>is the family that you've built.</i>

58:10.612 --> 58:13.239
LORNE: <i>The magic at ILM,</i>
<i>really was the people.</i>

58:13.740 --> 58:17.368
<i>The camaraderie was something</i>
<i>that I don't think you...</i>

58:18.620 --> 58:21.080
you can ever experience
in several lifetimes.

58:21.372 --> 58:22.707
It was a true joy.

58:23.583 --> 58:29.547
<i>I can't think of anything that I would</i>
<i>have gone back and done differently.</i>

58:30.381 --> 58:33.551
I still don't get it.
It's sort of like a weird dream.

58:34.219 --> 58:36.095
I think back at it and go, "No, no.

58:36.304 --> 58:39.140
"It couldn't have been like that
'cause it's too perfect."

58:39.224 --> 58:42.185
<i>I got to work on some of the best movies</i>
<i>people still talk about.</i>

58:42.268 --> 58:43.770
<i>It makes no sense to me.</i>

58:44.854 --> 58:46.940
(SNIFFLES) Um...

58:48.316 --> 58:53.446
I'm still astounded
by how well it has gone.

58:53.696 --> 58:56.658
Some great people here
and we're still friends.

58:56.741 --> 59:00.119
I'm friends with them after, like,
40 years or so and it's...

59:01.579 --> 59:03.122
<i>It's been terrific.</i>

59:05.667 --> 59:10.004
My daughter, she comes to me
and she says, "Dad, I have a problem

59:10.088 --> 59:12.257
"I need to talk to you about."
What she would do,

59:12.340 --> 59:16.469
every night after dinner, she would
go up to her room, shut her door,

59:16.553 --> 59:19.305
and she had all these plastic animals,
and she would come up

59:19.389 --> 59:21.474
with different scenarios for the animals.

59:21.975 --> 59:24.811
<i>Just like I did with army men</i>
<i>and plastic dinosaurs.</i>

59:25.270 --> 59:26.521
<i>So she said,</i>

59:26.604 --> 59:30.733
<i>"My problem is like I'm getting too old</i>
<i>to be playing with toys.</i>

59:31.109 --> 59:32.527
"That makes me sad."

59:33.236 --> 59:36.281
And I said, "Maya,
if you become a filmmaker,

59:36.406 --> 59:41.244
"you never have to grow up."
And we grab the Hi8 camera,

59:41.327 --> 59:45.748
and we just went out and we just started
in the backyard, that moment.
