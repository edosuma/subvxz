WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.090
I PUT TOGETHER
SOME NUMBERS

00:03.090 --> 00:04.352
SO YOU GUYS
COULD SEE HOW MUCH

00:04.352 --> 00:05.396
WE OWE THE HOSPITAL

00:05.396 --> 00:07.007
AND HOW WE CAN
PAY IT BACK.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.444
HEY. SORRY I'M LATE.

00:09.444 --> 00:10.793
HAD TO HELP WILL
WITH SOME MOVING STUFF.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.534
YEAH, NOBODY PARALLEL
PARKS A PANEL TRUCK

00:12.534 --> 00:14.014
LIKE YOUR
BROTHER BAILEY.
I COULDN'T SPARE HIM.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.145
HEY, HOW'S
GRIFFIN DOING?

00:15.145 --> 00:17.234
OH, HIS HEAD'S GONNA BE OK,

00:17.234 --> 00:18.844
AND THEY TOOK
THE CHEST TUBE THING OUT,

00:18.844 --> 00:20.455
BUT THEY--THEY'RE NOT
SURE ABOUT HIS HAND YET.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.197
YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME
TAKE THAT DOWNSTAIRS,

00:23.197 --> 00:24.502
LEAVE YOU GUYS ALONE.OK.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.678
YOU GOT IT?YEAH. SEE YA.

00:28.419 --> 00:29.638
WHAT IS THIS?

00:29.638 --> 00:31.422
IS THIS GRIFFIN'S
HOSPITAL BILL?

00:31.422 --> 00:33.990
THIS IS HOW MUCH
IT'S COSTING?

00:33.990 --> 00:35.252
HOW DID IT GET
SO EXPENSIVE?

00:35.252 --> 00:37.167
IT'S NOT JUST
THE SURGERY, CLAUD.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.647
IT'S EVERYTHING. IT'S
THE ROOM, IT'S THE TESTS--

00:38.647 --> 00:40.388
WHAT ARE
THESE NUMBERS HERE?

00:40.388 --> 00:42.129
THAT'S WHAT
THE RESTAURANT
TOOK IN LAST MONTH

00:42.129 --> 00:43.695
AND THE SHARE
WE EACH GOT.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.393
ISN'T THAT DOWN
A LITTLE BIT?

00:45.393 --> 00:48.091
WELL, IT'S A HOLIDAY TIME.
IT'LL COME BACK SOON.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.963
SO I FIGURE WE COULD EACH
GIVE UP A THIRD OF THAT

00:50.963 --> 00:52.356
AND PAY IT OFF
IN ABOUT 15 MONTHS.

00:52.356 --> 00:54.141
15 MONTHS?

00:54.141 --> 00:56.099
THAT'S THE MOST TIME
THEY'LL GIVE US.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.448
I KNOW IT'S HARSH,

00:57.448 --> 00:59.015
BUT AS SOON AS
THE HOSPITAL'S PAID OFF,

00:59.015 --> 01:00.712
I'M GONNA GIVE UP MY SHARE
AND PAY YOU GUYS BACK.

01:00.712 --> 01:02.105

THIS DECISION TOGETHER,

01:03.889 --> 01:05.369

WE'LL PAY FOR IT, TOO.

01:05.369 --> 01:08.198
I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE
THIS IS SO MUCH MONEY.

01:08.198 --> 01:10.592

SWING THIS, YOU KNOW.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.942

OTHER STUFF, TOO.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.516
I MEAN, UM...
LIKE MY TRUCK.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.387

THE TIRES INSTEAD

01:23.387 --> 01:25.172

THAT I CAN SELL OFF, TOO.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.738

SAVED UP FOR COLLEGE.

01:26.738 --> 01:29.306

ANYONE GIVING UP
THEIR SAVINGS.

01:29.306 --> 01:30.481
WE SAID WE'D
DO THIS TOGETHER,

01:30.481 --> 01:31.656
THEN--THEN
LET'S DO THAT.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.789

NOT MUCH.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.507
IT'S KIND OF NUMB.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.725
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

02:40.725 --> 02:42.597
WE REPLACED A NERVE
DURING THE SURGERY

02:42.597 --> 02:44.686
AND THE ENDS WERE CLEAN,
BUT IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME

02:44.686 --> 02:46.166
TO REGAIN FUNCTION.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.428
MY HEAD HURTS
LIKE HELL.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.169

02:49.169 --> 02:51.475

02:51.475 --> 02:53.738
SO, UH...SO WHAT NOW?

02:53.738 --> 02:57.002
AT SOME POINT YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER HAVING AN EMG,

02:57.002 --> 02:58.743
BUT WE CAN HOLD OFF
ON THAT FOR NOW.

02:58.743 --> 03:01.093
MAYBE DO IT
AS AN OUTPATIENT
WHEN HE CHECKS OUT.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.269
WHY HOLD OFF?

03:02.269 --> 03:06.316
UM...JUST HIS
INSURANCE SITUATION.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.103

TO DO, GO AHEAD.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.548
YOU GOTTA WORK
ON GETTING BETTER--

03:20.548 --> 03:23.638

SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY

03:23.638 --> 03:25.030

I'M SELLING MY BLENDER HERE?

03:38.783 --> 03:40.829

TO PAY FOR THIS.

33:20.868 --> 33:22.304
PLEASE,
I'M BEGGING YOU.

33:22.304 --> 33:23.218
SORRY.

33:30.573 --> 33:31.966
OK, I KNOW YOU
DON'T WANT MY HELP,

33:31.966 --> 33:33.228
BUT I THOUGHT IT
MIGHT BE HARD FOR YOU

33:33.228 --> 33:34.360
TO CHANGE THAT
DRESSING YOURSELF.

33:34.360 --> 33:38.233
SO, UH...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:38.233 --> 33:40.366
MOVING OUT OF THE SHED.

33:40.366 --> 33:43.151
WHAT?I CAN'T WORK, JULES.

33:43.151 --> 33:44.587
IF I CAN'T WORK,
I CAN'T PAY RENT,

33:44.587 --> 33:46.459
WHICH MEANS
I CAN'T STAY HERE.

33:46.459 --> 33:50.419
OK, GRIFFIN, IF YOU
WANT TO PAY US BACK,
THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.117
BUT WHO SAID WE NEED
THE MONEY NOW?

33:52.117 --> 33:53.944
I TOOK AN AD OUT
IN THE CLASSIFIEDS,

33:53.944 --> 33:55.642
SO MOST OF THIS STUFF
SHOULD SELL
PRETTY QUICK.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.861
I'LL BE OUT OF HERE
BY THIS WEEKEND.

33:57.861 --> 33:59.298
AND THE REST OF
THIS MONTH'S RENT
IS FOR YOU GUYS.

33:59.298 --> 34:00.603
JUST TAKE IT OUT
OF WHAT I OWE YOU,
OK?

34:00.603 --> 34:02.649
GRIFFIN, RELAX.
WE'RE NOT SOME BANK.

34:02.649 --> 34:06.000
I, UH, THINK
I'M GONNA BE LEAVING
TOWN FOR A WHILE.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.655
THIS HAULER
IN STOCKTON NEEDS
SOME BACKROOM HELP,

34:08.655 --> 34:12.050
SO, AS FAR AS
THE REST OF THE MONEY
THAT I OWE YOU GUYS--

34:12.050 --> 34:15.879
OK, GRIFFIN, STOP,
ALL RIGHT?

34:15.879 --> 34:21.929
YOU'RE TALKING LIKE
THIS IS SOME KIND OF
BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP HERE.

34:21.929 --> 34:25.324
LIKE YOU OWE THIS MONEY
BECAUSE WE'RE SOME STRANGERS

34:25.324 --> 34:28.457
WHO DECIDED TO PITCH IN
FOR NO REASON.

34:28.457 --> 34:30.851
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:30.851 --> 34:33.506
YOU HAD NO REASON
TO HELP MY LITTLE SISTER

34:33.506 --> 34:35.160
WHEN SHE WAS UNHAPPY
AT BOARDING SCHOOL.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.857
OR ME
WHEN I WAS WITH NED.

34:39.729 --> 34:41.905
SO IT'S TOO LATE,
IT'S TOO LATE TO SAY

34:41.905 --> 34:43.603
YOU'RE NOT
A PART OF THIS FAMILY.

34:43.603 --> 34:45.779
'CAUSE IF YOU
DIDN'T WANT US
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU,

34:45.779 --> 34:47.389
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE TAKEN CARE OF US.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.583
YOU WANT SOME
OF THIS KUNG PAO?

35:07.583 --> 35:09.977
ACTUALLY LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.
NOT TOO GELATINOUS.

35:09.977 --> 35:12.240
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING, BAILEY?

35:12.240 --> 35:15.722
IT'S JUST YOU'VE
BEEN A LITTLE QUIET.

35:17.463 --> 35:21.249
WELL, I WAS JUST--
I WAS JUST REALLY
INTO THAT MOVIE.

35:21.249 --> 35:25.210
DID I FREAK YOU OUT
WITH THAT "HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOU" SPEECH?

35:25.210 --> 35:28.648
NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.302
'CAUSE I WANT YOU
TO KNOW

35:30.302 --> 35:34.001
THAT I AM
ENTIRELY CAPABLE OF
TAKING THINGS SLOWLY.

35:34.001 --> 35:35.785
IT'S MY SPECIALITY.

35:35.785 --> 35:38.048
I'M ACTUALLY DATING
DOZENS OF GUYS
AT THIS VERY MOMENT

35:38.048 --> 35:39.789
JUST SO NONE OF YOU
FEEL TOO CROWDED.

35:39.789 --> 35:42.052
HOLLY.I KNOW,

35:42.052 --> 35:43.750
YOU THINK
I'M BONKERS.

35:43.750 --> 35:47.362
IT'S OK. I LOVED
WHAT YOU SAID, OK?

35:47.362 --> 35:48.798
REALLY?

35:48.798 --> 35:50.278
YES, REALLY.

35:50.278 --> 35:51.584
YOU SURE?

35:53.847 --> 35:55.327
GOD, LOOK AT WHAT
YOU'VE DONE TO ME.

35:55.327 --> 35:58.330
I USED TO BE
SUCH A COOL AND
DETACHED BRIT.

35:58.330 --> 36:00.332
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

36:00.332 --> 36:02.334
THAT'S ME.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.336
[RING]

36:04.336 --> 36:06.816
HELLO?

36:06.816 --> 36:08.514
CHARLIE, HEY,
WHAT'S UP?

36:08.514 --> 36:11.125
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
WHERE?

36:11.125 --> 36:12.387
LISTEN,
I HATE TO ASK,

36:12.387 --> 36:14.346
BUT OUR CREDIT CARDS
ARE ALL MAXED OUT.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.870
NO--DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
JUST TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE.

36:16.870 --> 36:19.133
NORTH BEACH PRECINCT,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COME DOWN HERE.

36:19.133 --> 36:21.004
JUST TELL THE CLERK
YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER
OVER THE PHONE.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.267
OK, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

36:22.267 --> 36:23.311
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT, BAILEY.

36:23.311 --> 36:25.183
BAILEY?

36:26.445 --> 36:28.055
WHAT'S
WRONG?

36:28.055 --> 36:31.232
CHARLIE GOT HIS CAR BOOTED.

36:31.232 --> 36:33.887
I GOTTA GO DOWN THERE
AND PAY FOR IT.

36:33.887 --> 36:35.671
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

36:35.671 --> 36:37.586
WELL, ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:37.586 --> 36:42.504
UM, I'M JUST GONNA
HAVE TO DRIVE HIM AROUND
ALL NIGHT, YOU KNOW?

36:42.504 --> 36:45.899
SO, UH, THE BEST THING--

36:45.899 --> 36:47.988
WHY DON'T YOU STAY HERE?

36:47.988 --> 36:52.471
AND THEN I'LL, UH,
I'LL JUST CALL YOU
WHEN I'M DONE, OK?

36:52.471 --> 36:55.822
ACTUALLY, IT'S KIND
OF LATE ALREADY.

36:55.822 --> 37:00.783
WHY DON'T--
I'LL JUST CALL YOU
TOMORROW.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.742
THAT BE OK?

37:03.917 --> 37:06.485
YEAH.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.356
IT'S FINE.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.447
WAIT A MINUTE.

37:12.447 --> 37:13.840
A BABY?

37:13.840 --> 37:15.407
YOU GUYS,
THAT'S SO GREAT!

37:15.407 --> 37:16.930
WE KNOW.
WE KNOW THAT.

37:16.930 --> 37:19.019
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THIS SOONER?

37:19.019 --> 37:22.501
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I GOT
THOSE SAVINGS BONDS--
FOR STUFF LIKE THIS.

37:22.501 --> 37:25.460
I BELIEVE YOU. BUT...
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.
WE DIDN'T WANT THAT.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.419
WE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE
THIS YOUR PROBLEM.

37:27.419 --> 37:30.422
MY PROBLEM? CHARLIE,
YOU'RE NOT MY PROBLEM,
YOU'RE MY BROTHER.

37:30.422 --> 37:33.555
LOOK, THIS IS
EXACTLY THE CONVERSATION
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE HAVING.

37:33.555 --> 37:35.557
IT'S TOO LATE.
YOU'RE HAVING IT NOW.NO, WE'RE NOT.

37:35.557 --> 37:39.605
WE'RE NOT HAVING IT,
BAILEY. I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.520
Bailey: OH. OK.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.391
I'M SORRY.

37:43.391 --> 37:44.871
YOU GUYS SIT TIGHT.
I'LL GET THE CAR.

37:44.871 --> 37:46.438
OK.

37:48.483 --> 37:49.484
KIRSTEN...

37:49.484 --> 37:51.530
WE ARE GONNA
DO THIS, OK?

37:51.530 --> 37:53.662
EVENTUALLY WE WILL,
CHARLIE.

37:55.534 --> 37:57.579
I HOPE SO.

37:57.579 --> 37:59.364
I MEAN, I REALLY,
REALLY WANT THIS.

37:59.364 --> 38:00.756
I KNOW.

38:00.756 --> 38:02.454
ME, TOO.

38:03.324 --> 38:04.847
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:04.847 --> 38:07.894
REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
AT THE HOSPITAL?

38:07.894 --> 38:09.591
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY?

38:09.591 --> 38:11.680
YOU SAID
YOU TRUSTED FATE.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.900
SO MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.597
MAYBE THIS IS FATE
TELLING US

38:15.597 --> 38:18.948
THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
FIRST--

38:18.948 --> 38:22.343
LIKE WORK.
YOUR WORK, MY WORK.
STUFF FOR OURSELVES.

38:24.432 --> 38:25.607
I DON'T KNOW.

38:25.607 --> 38:27.783
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO,
CHARLIE.

38:27.783 --> 38:30.351
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT
HOW FATE WORKS?

38:36.401 --> 38:37.402
HEY.

38:37.402 --> 38:38.577
HEY.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.538
I'VE BEEN
CALLING YOU.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.018
SORRY. I JUST...

38:45.018 --> 38:47.542
I DIDN'T REALLY
FEEL LIKE TALKING.

38:49.022 --> 38:51.459
CLAUD, LOOK. I...

38:51.459 --> 38:53.418
I KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE...

38:53.418 --> 38:57.509
TO HAVE BEEN
THE BEST FOR A WHILE
AND HAVE THAT CHANGE.

38:57.509 --> 38:59.859
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T STILL BE GOOD.

38:59.859 --> 39:01.077
I GUESS.

39:01.077 --> 39:03.341
THERE ARE A LOT
OF GREAT THINGS

39:03.341 --> 39:05.081
YOU CAN DO
WITH YOUR MUSIC.

39:05.081 --> 39:08.520
YOU CAN PLAY
IN CHAMBER GROUPS.
YOU CAN TEACH.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.217
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

39:11.784 --> 39:14.917
ROSS, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT MEANT...

39:14.917 --> 39:16.441
I MEAN,
TO HAVE SOMETHING

39:16.441 --> 39:19.052
THAT I COULD
COMPLETELY COUNT ON.

39:19.052 --> 39:22.534
KNOWING THAT IF I
WORKED HARD ENOUGH AND I
PRACTICED AND PRACTICED,

39:22.534 --> 39:24.840
I KNEW WHAT
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.103
I MEAN, I KNEW
THAT I COULD WIN.

39:28.670 --> 39:31.499
IF I CAN'T HAVE THAT...

39:31.499 --> 39:34.502
I MEAN, IF I CAN'T BE
THE WAY I WAS...

39:37.853 --> 39:40.421
THEN I DON'T WANT
TO PLAY.

39:45.557 --> 39:47.428
GREAT.
OK, YOU LOST ME THERE.

39:47.428 --> 39:49.256
YOUR PROBLEM WITH HOLLY
IS...THERE'S NO PROBLEM?

39:49.256 --> 39:50.736
EXACTLY.

39:50.736 --> 39:52.868
RIGHT. RIGHT, BECAUSE
SHE'S GOT A BOYFRIEND.

39:52.868 --> 39:56.089
UH-UH. SHE BROKE UP
WITH THE BOYFRIEND.

39:56.089 --> 39:58.091
SO...YOU LIKE HER,
AND SHE LIKES YOU,

39:58.091 --> 39:59.701
AND SHE DUMPED
HER BOYFRIEND
TO BE WITH YOU,

39:59.701 --> 40:01.529
AND THAT'S
WHAT'S WRONG.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.531
YEAH. I HATE
WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.403
WELL, COME ON, MAN,
THINK ABOUT IT.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.535
I'VE BEEN BROKEN UP
WITH SARAH FOR LESS
THAN A MONTH,

40:07.535 --> 40:10.320
AND I'M JUST GETTING READY
TO START DATING AGAIN,
AND WHAM--

40:10.320 --> 40:12.758
I MEET
THIS AMAZING PERSON--

40:12.758 --> 40:15.238
I MUST'VE HAD
TOO MUCH SEX
IN A PREVIOUS LIFE,

40:15.238 --> 40:16.718
AND YOU MUST'VE BEEN,
LIKE, A NUN.

40:16.718 --> 40:18.546
NO. THERE IS NOTHING
ABOUT THIS GIRL

40:18.546 --> 40:21.288
THAT MAKES ME THINK
IT COULD GO SOUTH.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.943
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
THAT COULD BREAK US UP,
WILL.

40:23.943 --> 40:26.554
NOPE. SORRY.
STILL NO CLUE.

40:26.554 --> 40:29.514
I'M A COUPLE OF DATES
AND SOME PILLOW TALK

40:29.514 --> 40:31.385
AWAY FROM
A BIG-TIME COMMITMENT.

40:32.691 --> 40:34.997
COMMITMENT.
THINK ABOUT THAT.

40:34.997 --> 40:37.086
OK, YEAH. THAT'S
A LITTLE BIT
SCARY. RIGHT.

40:37.086 --> 40:39.437
BUT...DON'T--DON'T
YOU HAVE A CHOICE
IN THE MATTER?

40:39.437 --> 40:41.613
I MEAN, CAN'T YOU PUT
THE BRAKES ON AT ALL?

40:41.613 --> 40:43.571
I'M TRYING, BUT I--
I GOTTA TELL YOU, MAN,

40:43.571 --> 40:45.399
I DON'T REALLY THINK
I WANT TO.

40:45.399 --> 40:48.141
I WANT TO BE WITH HER...
ALL THE TIME.

40:48.141 --> 40:51.623
SO THAT'S WHY YOU
WANTED TO HANG OUT,
GIVE IT A LITTLE SPACE?

40:53.494 --> 40:56.366
SO, TELL ME SOME MORE
ABOUT--ABOUT 3COM.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.935
RIGHT. WELL, UH,
APPARENTLY,

40:59.935 --> 41:02.590
SAN FRANCISCO HAS
ALL THESE LITTLE
MICRO-CLIMATES,

41:02.590 --> 41:04.331
AND IF YOU'LL LOOK OFF
THE END OF THE STADIUM,

41:04.331 --> 41:06.464
YOU SEE
THOSE FLAGS THERE.SORRY.

41:06.464 --> 41:09.728
I JUST REMEMBERED. HOLLY AND I
WERE GONNA SEE A MOVIE,
AND I NEVER CONFIRMED.

41:11.643 --> 41:14.428
BUT KEEP GOIN'. KEEP GOIN'.
I'M INTERESTED IN THIS.

41:15.864 --> 41:18.432
UH...SO...
A LOT OF TIMES,

41:18.432 --> 41:20.565
THE FLAGS FLY
STRAIGHT AT EACH OTHER

41:20.565 --> 41:23.481
IN OP--
IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.HEY. IT'S ME.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.091
HI.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.919
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING.

41:32.925 --> 41:35.405
SO THIS IS
HOW IT'LL WORK. NOW,

41:35.405 --> 41:37.407
I WANT TO KEEP
MY SHOP IN THE SHED.

41:37.407 --> 41:38.931
I GOT THIS BUDDY
WHO OWES ME A FAVOR,

41:38.931 --> 41:41.324
SO HE'LL HELP ME OUT
UNTIL I GET BACK
TO NORMAL.

41:41.324 --> 41:43.196
AND I WORKED OUT
A PAYMENT PLAN--
$300 A MONTH,

41:43.196 --> 41:45.459
AND DOUBLE THAT
WHENEVER I GO BACK
FULL-TIME.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.417
ALL RIGHT. AND WHEN--
WHEN MY HAND GETS BETTER,

41:47.417 --> 41:50.986
I'M GONNA WORK
ON THE HOUSE FOR YOU GUYS,
DO WHATEVER ELSE YOU NEED.

41:50.986 --> 41:52.205
ALL RIGHT?

41:54.424 --> 41:55.774
'CAUSE...

41:55.774 --> 41:58.428
I--I DON'T WANT
TO BE A BURDEN, JULIA.

41:59.647 --> 42:01.083
THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

42:01.083 --> 42:02.432
GRIFFIN,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

42:02.432 --> 42:06.262
LOOK...SO, I CAN'T...

42:06.262 --> 42:08.351
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
I JUST...

42:10.310 --> 42:13.226
ASKIN' FOR YOUR HELP...

42:13.226 --> 42:16.359
OR YOUR BROTHERS
OR YOUR SISTER...

42:16.359 --> 42:18.100
IT'S, LIKE, I'D...

42:18.100 --> 42:21.060
RATHER ASK ANYBODY ELSE...

42:21.060 --> 42:22.975
I MEAN, MY PARENTS...

42:22.975 --> 42:24.063
A STRANGER...

42:24.063 --> 42:25.412
ANYBODY.

42:25.412 --> 42:26.587
WHY?

42:26.587 --> 42:29.808
GRIFFIN,
WE WANT TO HELP YOU.

42:29.808 --> 42:31.461
SO MUCH.

42:33.115 --> 42:34.508
MAYBE THAT'S WHY.

42:38.077 --> 42:40.470
LOOK, I'M...UM...

42:40.470 --> 42:44.257
I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT...
YOU KNOW, SAYIN' THIS STUFF.

42:47.260 --> 42:49.479
SO IF I DON'T...
SEEM THANKFUL...

42:51.917 --> 42:53.483
I AM.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.530
I REALLY AM.
