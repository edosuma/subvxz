00:32.500 --> 00:33.800
there's a basement.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.300
damn.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.700
damn.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.500
you sure it's him?

00:53.500 --> 00:55.000
who else could it be?

00:55.900 --> 00:57.300
i just want
to make sure.

00:57.300 --> 01:00.400
male. approximately
6 years old. i'm sorry.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.500
there's something in here.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.700
what's that baby doing here?

01:09.600 --> 01:11.800
j.j. can't let her baby
be at a crime scene.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.800
reid.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.800
j.j.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.200
reid.

01:18.600 --> 01:19.500
sorry, i was dreaming.

01:19.500 --> 01:20.800
ha, no kidding.

01:21.300 --> 01:25.500
we found a 6-year-old
boy who had been abused and stabbed.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.200
your baby was
at the crime scene.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.900
i was trying to get him
out of there.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.600
sorry.

01:33.100 --> 01:33.900
it's ok.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.300
you know, reid,
simple dream analysis--

01:35.300 --> 01:37.700
if there's a baby in your dreams,
that baby's actually you.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.000
i don't believe in
dream analysis.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.200
i don't know.
it makes sense.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.300
the case we're working on and the case in your dream 
both involve children.

01:43.300 --> 01:46.000
maybe your subconscious is
telling you you want to sit this one out.

01:46.000 --> 01:46.800
i don't.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.100
well, maybe you're just stressed out
about going home to las vegas.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.900
did you tell your mom
you're coming?

01:52.400 --> 01:54.500
why aren't we reviewing
the case file?

01:54.700 --> 01:58.100
i don't know. maybe because
someone fell asleep on the jet.

01:59.900 --> 02:01.700
all right, let's start
from the beginning one more time.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.800
this is ethan hayes.
he was 5.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.400
2 weeks ago he was abducted
out of his own front yard.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.400
where were the parents?

02:07.400 --> 02:09.199
his mom just ran inside
to grab her purse.

02:09.199 --> 02:10.500
when she came back,
he was gone.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.600
she wasn't away for more
than a minute or 2.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.900
police found his body
exactly one week later in the desert.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.700
he was in a new change
of clothes.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.800
his nails clipped.
his hair was combed.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.000
that's a lot of remorse.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
no sign of sexual assault.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.200
the medical report suggests
he was smothered.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.700
unsub could see this death
as merciful.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.900
who's the new boy?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.400
michael bridges.

02:31.600 --> 02:36.000
yesterday, he set out to walk by himself
to a friend's house a block away 
and he never showed up.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.900
are we sure these cases are
even connected?

02:37.900 --> 02:39.600
the unsub called
each of the families.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.300
but no ransom demand.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.100
it was more like taunts.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.200
he's telling them
it's their fault that their child was taken.

02:46.200 --> 02:50.400
ok. so, we have an unsub who shows remorse 
and then projects his own guilt onto the victims' parents.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.600
and if we're lucky, 6 days to find the boy
before he is killed.

amos bronson alcott said,

04:01.500 --> 04:07.900
"who speaks to the instincts speaks to the deepest in mankind 
and finds ???

04:08.800 --> 04:10.600
det. ashby?
jennifer jareau.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.900
this is aaron hotchner.

04:11.900 --> 04:12.800
thanks for getting here
so quick.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.000
morning.
what can you tell us?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.600
we've got an amber alert
in effect.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.000
tip line's being run through
the precinct.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.300
his photo's on the wire.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.600
has the phone company been
served with a caller subscription subpoena?

04:21.600 --> 04:24.200
yeah. we'll get a name and location 
if he's calling from a land line.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.100
we'll also run the calls
through our analyst at quantico.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.600
she can triangulate
cell calls.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.700
we need to clear the area
of official vehicles.

04:29.700 --> 04:33.600
if the unsub happens to drive by,
i don't want him to panic ???

04:33.600 --> 04:35.800
ok. i'll clear 'em out after
we make introductions.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.400
how are they
handling it?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.100
separate.

04:46.700 --> 04:50.300
craig, amy bridges,
these are agents jareau and hotchner from the fbi.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.400
we just want to say how sorry we are 
for what you're going through

04:53.400 --> 04:57.100
but we're here to do whatever we can 
to try and get michael home.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.400
i'm going to tell you
what i told the police.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.600
i don't want to know
what happened to that other boy.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.900
i just want to hear how you're going to find michael.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.100
we understand.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.400
no, you don't.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.100
you're right.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.100
i don't know exactly
what you're going through.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.200
but i do know these cases.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.500
and we're gonna need your help.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.900
of course. we know that.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.300
was it normal for michael
to walk to a friend's house by himself?

05:25.300 --> 05:26.200
what are you saying?

05:26.300 --> 05:27.300
it's just a question.

05:27.300 --> 05:28.300
no it's not.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.200
do you think we had
something to do with this?

05:30.500 --> 05:31.200
no. i don't.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.500
if this was his routine, someone could have 
been watching him for some time now.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.200
he'd only done it
a couple times.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.100
amy and i had
a fight about it.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.500
i thought
we were babying him.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.200
i don't want him
crawling into bed with us anymore.

05:42.200 --> 05:46.100
and i thought he should be able to walk 
to a friend's house by himself, alone.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.800
he was really proud
of himself the first time he did it.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.000
excuse me.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.400
i'm sorry.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.900
it's like she can't engage
in what's going on.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.200
it's all right.
everybody deals with it differently.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.900
i need to know what happened
to that other boy.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.200
there was no bruising
around his neck or face.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.600
i'm guessing
he used a pillow.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.900
was there any sign
of a struggle?

06:09.900 --> 06:12.300
no, but he would have
been extremely weak.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.300
why's that?

06:13.300 --> 06:15.500
this is where it gets weird.
he was noticeably thin.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.000
and both his stomach and intestines were
completely empty.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.300
he was being starved?

06:19.400 --> 06:20.500
it seems that way.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.700
ok. so,
what's the weird part?

06:21.700 --> 06:24.500
i wanted to determine
if malnutrition played a part in his death.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.900
so, i looked for evidence
of starvation ketosis

06:26.900 --> 06:30.700
by analyzing some vitreous humor--
the squishy part OF THE EYEBALL

06:30.800 --> 06:32.900
and i couldn't find
any ketone bodies there.

06:33.100 --> 06:33.700
meaning?

06:33.700 --> 06:35.500
he was getting
nutrients somehow.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.400
through an i.v.?

06:36.400 --> 06:37.800
there were no marks
to indicate that.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.200
any idea
what else could it be?

06:39.200 --> 06:41.300
honestly, i have no idea.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.700
CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS

06:44.700 --> 06:47.700
not exactly
a well-preserved scene.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.600
it's the crime scene
investigators.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.000
they all want to play cop instead of just being
scientists--

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
and they end up trampling
on everything.

06:54.800 --> 06:58.800
so, he suffocates the boy at another location,
prepares the body,

06:58.800 --> 07:01.800
takes him out to the middle
of nowhere and dumps him.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.200
except there were no traces of the unsub's sweat
on the boy's clothing.

07:05.200 --> 07:05.900
what are you getting at?

07:05.900 --> 07:07.800
well, it's like 1,000 degrees
out here.

07:07.800 --> 07:12.000
if he carried the body,
then he would have gotten
traces of sweat on the clothes.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.300
so, he wraps him
in something.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.700
no fibers.

07:14.800 --> 07:20.300
so, he took the time to change the boy's clothing 
and groom him ONCE HE GOT HERE.

07:20.900 --> 07:24.200
if he took that much time,
he'd have to do it at night.

07:24.700 --> 07:28.300
but you still run the risk of someone recalling your
car once the body's found.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.000
not if you didn't have
to park it by the road.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.600
well, you'd want to park a distance away from the dump site

07:36.600 --> 07:40.300
just in case someone saw the car 
and came to see what you were up to.

07:40.800 --> 07:41.800
now, tell me this.

07:41.800 --> 07:45.300
<i>if you can drive out
into the desert to dump a body,</i>

07:45.300 --> 07:48.200
why not go in deeper, where you 
won't be seen from the road?

07:48.900 --> 07:52.000
because he wanted to be able to drive by and see the body.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.300
that's why he groomed him.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.300
it's like he was preparing him
for a funeral.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.400
yeah. i got it.

08:02.900 --> 08:03.900
thank you.

08:05.900 --> 08:09.600
detective, the funeral for the first victim is tomorrow.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.400
do you feel comfortable asking the family
if they'd be willing to open THE SERVICE UP TO THE PUBLIC?

08:13.400 --> 08:16.600
- why's that? - we feel if they do, 
there's a good chance the unsub will come.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.800
i'll go speak to them.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.200
craig, we'd like you and your wife to consider
being there as well.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.400
good. anything.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.000
i think you should talk
to amy about it.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.400
if it might help,
there's nothing to discuss.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.800
i understand. but, please,
just...discuss it with her.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.400
when the police asked
for a picture of michael,

08:48.400 --> 08:50.500
i couldn't decide
what to give them.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.900
i didn't know if it was
right for him to be smiling.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.000
any choice you made
would have been right.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.600
my husband doesn't know
what to do with himself.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.200
he thinks we should be
out there looking for him.

09:04.300 --> 09:07.900
the best thing for you right now 
is to just let us guide you through this.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.200
he thinks i blame him.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.100
i'm sure that's not true.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.100
he's right.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.700
my son's been taken.

09:16.800 --> 09:17.700
i'm completely frozen.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.800
and now i'm blaming
my husband.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.200
i feel like a monster.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.100
when they need you,
you'll come through.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.700
you don't even know me.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.500
call it intuition.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.200
i found it when i came into his room,
after he'd been taken.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.800
we don't let him eat in bed.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.000
i haven't moved it
because...

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
i don't want him to think he's in trouble
for breaking the rules.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.700
you know what you're having?

10:10.200 --> 10:12.300
it's--it's a boy.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.700
congratulations.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.100
- garcia, you ready?
- ready.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.800
mr. bridges, let's go back
over what we discussed.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.200
- he's got my son.
- exactly.

10:28.200 --> 10:31.400
just stay positive.
i've written down some important phrases--

10:31.400 --> 10:32.500
we need to answer the phone.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.600
mr. bridges, please.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.700
i think amy should do this.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.000
she doesn't want to do this.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.200
no. i don't.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.400
it's our experience that the parent that's
least emotional is best.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.900
amy, you'll be great.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.100
just try to humanize michael
at every opportunity.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.800
he needs to see him
as a person.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.600
try to keep him on the line as long
as you possibly can.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.200
the more he talks,
the more he'll reveal about himself.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.500
hello.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.700
are you alone?

11:00.100 --> 11:02.100
um, my husband is with me.

11:02.100 --> 11:05.400
why are you just sitting at home
when you should be out looking for your boy?

11:07.700 --> 11:10.600
you're right.
we need to do that.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.800
he's better off with me.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.600
thank you for calling us
to let us know michael's all right.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.500
i didn't say
he was all right.

11:19.500 --> 11:23.900
i know. i'm--i'm just
trusting that he's ok.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.800
he's in a better place now.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.400
may i speak with michael?

11:30.400 --> 11:31.900
he doesn't want
to talk to you.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.000
he knows what a bad mother
you are.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.600
your 3 minutes are up.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.300
garcia, anything?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.900
it looks to be
a disposable cell phone.

11:45.900 --> 11:49.600
i couldn't triangulate the call. 
but it did bounce off not one but 2 towers.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.900
- meaning?
- i know he's mobile.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.600
and i know he's moving
within the las vegas limits.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.200
he didn't travel
outside the city.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.400
it's just a start.

11:56.900 --> 11:59.400
like i said, the more he talks,
the more we'll learn about him.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.600
these are agents
morgan and reid.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.900
they'll be here all night
just in case he calls back.

12:04.500 --> 12:05.800
i need to lie down.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.100
of course.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.000
you should go with her.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.400
yeah.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.300
what'd you find out
from the medical examiner?

12:17.500 --> 12:19.200
we think that
he's starving them.

12:19.300 --> 12:21.800
but that doesn't fit with the care he takes
with the bodies.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.600
starvation would be
a form of torture.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.900
there's no sexual assault.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.300
the torture could be
a substitute for the sex act.

12:28.300 --> 12:29.700
i'll coordinate
with rossi and prentiss.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.200
we'll call you
if there's anything new.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.900
couldn't find any evidence
of forced entry.

13:18.900 --> 13:20.200
why would that matter?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.300
'cause it means he most likely knew
his attacker.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.500
reid?

13:28.700 --> 13:30.500
get 'em off. morgan!
get 'em off! get 'em off!

13:30.500 --> 13:31.700
morgan, get 'em off me!
get 'em off me!

13:31.700 --> 13:33.800
get 'em off me!

13:33.800 --> 13:35.400
get 'em--
morgan, get 'em off me!

13:35.400 --> 13:37.100
reid. reid. wake up.

13:37.100 --> 13:37.900
it's morgan.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.100
what the hell's going on?

13:40.200 --> 13:41.800
sir, ma'am.
everything's ok.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.000
you wake us up screaming,
you think everything's ok?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.100
i understand we startled you.
and i'm sorry for that.

13:46.100 --> 13:47.400
you're the f.b.i.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.600
you're right.
i'm really sorry.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.200
sir, please, go back upstairs 
and try to get some rest.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.500
it was just
a misunderstanding.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.700
everything is fine,
i promise you that.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.900
are you ok?

14:09.600 --> 14:11.600
it was a dream.
i'm really sorry.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.400
was it about michael?

14:15.600 --> 14:16.900
no.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.600
i've been afraid
to close my eyes.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.000
i'm scared i'll see him die.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.800
ma'am, i know it's hard.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.500
but i need you to go upstairs 
and try to get some sleep.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.900
please.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.000
i am sorry
for the disturbance.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.400
i'm making everything worse.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.000
reid...

14:54.300 --> 14:56.100
these cases get to all of us.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.500
i'm losing it
in their living room.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.800
and i'm dreaming--

15:00.000 --> 15:04.900
i'm dreaming about dead kids
and covered in leeches.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.700
what the hell is scaring you?

15:09.600 --> 15:12.400
this boy's gonna die
and there's nothing i can do to stop it.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.600
i can't do this.
i'm sorry.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.000
what are you doing?

15:43.200 --> 15:44.300
i'm not going to the funeral.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.300
we talked about this.

15:45.300 --> 15:47.200
no, you talked. i listened.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.700
please, tell her
this is our only chance.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.400
we feel like
it's a viable plan.

15:51.400 --> 15:55.600
 you're asking us to go to
the funeral of a 5-year-old boy.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.900
we're going to watch them
lower his body into the ground.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.500
<i>and the same man
who killed him has our son.</i>

16:00.500 --> 16:04.000
if the man who took michael is there,
your presence MIGHT JUST STARTLE HIM.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
we're looking for anything that
might draw him out.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.100
i can't watch them bury
a child knowing that we're next.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.800
we feel like this plan
has a reasonable chance SUCCESS.

16:11.800 --> 16:18.500
what do you consider a reasonable chance 
that i will ever see my son again? 10%? 20?

16:18.700 --> 16:20.000
i can't give you numbers.

16:20.900 --> 16:21.700
you could.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.900
i understand
if you can't do this.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.800
but if you can, we need to talk about 
who we're looking for.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.700
we believe the man
we're looking for is white.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.900
he's probably in his
late 20s to mid-30s.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.900
judging by the quality of the clothing he put
his first victim in,

16:37.900 --> 16:40.200
we believe he comes from
a middle-class background.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.600
this is not someone who is going to be 
at the funeral in a high-end or well tailored suit.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.200
he also might be paying
a lot of attention

16:45.200 --> 16:47.700
to the parents of the most
recent boy to be abducted.

16:47.700 --> 16:51.700
<i>watch for anyone whose focus 
is on them instead of the service itself.</i>

16:51.700 --> 16:54.800
we also believe he may drive
a 4-wheel-drive vehicle.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.700
pay extra attention
to those mourners.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.300
and memorize license plates.

16:58.300 --> 17:01.200
this unsub dumped his last
body far from the city.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.300
and yet,
he didn't try to hide it.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.400
in fact, it was close enough
to be seen from the road.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.599
that tells us he's trying
to separate his actions from himself.

17:08.599 --> 17:11.400
yet, he wanted to be able
to drive out and visit the body.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.400
this is about remorse.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.500
which is why we believe
there's a good chance he'll be there today.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.400
ok. if you sense someone looking
at you you need to tell us.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.599
we're conditioned
to feel fear.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.000
the little hairs
on the back of your neck?

17:27.599 --> 17:28.900
they tell us the truth.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.900
j.j. will stay here.
if the phone rings,

17:30.900 --> 17:33.400
she'll say she's a family friend and
that you're at a funeral.

17:36.700 --> 17:37.900
you can do this.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.900
hey, kid,
we're almost ready to go.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.200
you know, they're right.

17:56.200 --> 18:01.500
odds are we'll catch the unsub when he dumps the body 
or when he tries to snatch another kid.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.700
i know the odds, reid.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.500
it's weird.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.200
some things never go away.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.900
when i was a kid,
every boy i knew had piles of dinosaur toys.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.000
not you?

18:16.200 --> 18:17.900
i had books and notebooks.

18:17.900 --> 18:24.000
my mom filled hundreds of them 
with poems by w.s. merwin,
BY BOB DYLAN.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.200
she liked it
when i memorized them.

18:25.200 --> 18:30.900
she was convinced that they were watching us 
and writing songs ABOUT THEIR WIVES.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.300
basements are the first part
of a house to be built, right?

18:35.800 --> 18:37.900
so if you're having recurring dream
about a basement,

18:37.900 --> 18:41.100
kinda speaks to the core
fundamentals of who you are as a person.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.100
i thought you didn't believe
in dream analysis.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.900
freud's been discredited
but jung still has his merits.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.700
my dream. the dead boy.

18:52.200 --> 18:56.600
i've been having different versions of it
since i was a little kid.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.300
hey.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.900
you know, nobody would think less of you
if you took a little time off ???

19:06.200 --> 19:07.500
i just want
to find this boy.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.100
there's a very full
crowd here today,

19:22.800 --> 19:29.200
which i believe is part of the natural outpouring of grief
over losing someone so innocent.

19:30.500 --> 19:35.700
it is also a reminder that there
is another boy out there
who is in danger

19:35.700 --> 19:37.900
AND HIM NEED OF OUR PRAYERS.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.500
let's take a moment
and pray for that boy.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.400
for his safe return.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.100
he's here.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.600
why aren't you helping me?

20:28.700 --> 20:31.200
spencer, pay attention.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.300
reid.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.600
what's going on?

20:39.200 --> 20:40.700
i've been here before.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.600
in the name
of the father, son,
holy ghost. amen.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.700
let us take comfort in the gospel
according to matthew.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.300
chapter 18.

20:54.900 --> 20:59.000
"at that time, the disciples
came to jesus and asked,

20:59.300 --> 21:01.800
"who is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven?

21:03.000 --> 21:06.600
"he called a child,
whom he put among them and said,

21:07.200 --> 21:08.700
"'truly i tell you,

21:09.300 --> 21:12.600
"'unless you change
and become like children,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.600
"'you will never enter
the kingdom of heaven.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.600
whoever becomes humble...'"

21:17.600 --> 21:19.500
are you a friend
of the family?

21:19.900 --> 21:21.700
uh, no.

21:21.700 --> 21:25.200
i just read about it IN THE PAPER.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.800
and you decided
to come to the funeral?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
yeah. it was sad.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.800
i love kids.

21:33.700 --> 21:36.400
i wanted the family
to know that people care.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
and videotaping it?
who's that for?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.300
we're gonna take a walk.

21:44.200 --> 21:48.500
and we're gonna do it
very quietly so as not
to disturb these people.

21:58.300 --> 22:02.500
where were you on the days ethan hayes and
michael bridges were abducted?

22:02.600 --> 22:03.700
i was home.

22:03.900 --> 22:07.000
don't you need to ask
what days those were?

22:07.100 --> 22:08.300
am i under arrest?

22:08.400 --> 22:09.700
no. you love kids.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.800
you're just helping us
with an investigation.

22:11.800 --> 22:15.200
so, you have no right
to search me.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.900
why? what would we find?

22:17.900 --> 22:22.200
oh, do you like videotaping other things
besides funerals?

22:28.300 --> 22:29.100
how's it going?

22:30.300 --> 22:31.400
he's nervous.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.700
they're trying
to pin him down.

22:33.100 --> 22:33.900
what's that?

22:35.300 --> 22:36.400
you mind giving us a minute?

22:36.400 --> 22:37.600
no, sure.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.600
i had one of the detectives
pull it.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.600
the name riley jenkins
mean anything to you?

22:48.500 --> 22:49.200
no.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.000
think.

22:51.100 --> 22:52.500
back to when
you were a little boy.

22:54.100 --> 22:56.600
i had an imaginary friend
named riley when i was little.

23:00.800 --> 23:01.900
riley jenkins.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.500
he was murdered right here in las vegas
when he was 6 years old.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.100
my math says that you would have been
around 4 at the time.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.700
he was found him in the basement of his own house, 
behind the dryer.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.900
he'd been sexually abused
and stabbed.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.800
where can we find
michael bridges?

23:23.900 --> 23:25.300
you are trying to frame me.

23:25.600 --> 23:29.100
you killed ethan hayes,
and you're holding michael bridges.

23:29.100 --> 23:29.500
no.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.700
<i>then why were you
videotaping a funeral?</i>

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
does death excite you?

23:35.200 --> 23:39.100
oh, wait. that's it.
death gets you off.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.600
i told you, i don't touch.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.200
no. you just kill 'em and find new ways
to watch him afterwards.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.100
i am not sick.

23:44.100 --> 23:45.100
i think you are.

23:45.100 --> 23:47.600
and i think you
desperately want to tell us

23:47.600 --> 23:50.300
exactly how sick
you really are, walter? don't you?

23:50.300 --> 23:53.400
you want us to search
your computer and your home

23:53.400 --> 23:55.200
because this is eating
you up inside

23:55.200 --> 23:56.600
and you know you need
to be stopped.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.700
i never would have
molested that boy!

24:00.200 --> 24:01.300
which boy?

24:01.800 --> 24:03.000
the one from the funeral.

24:18.700 --> 24:19.900
hotchner.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.600
he doesn't know details
of the murder.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.100
you sure?

24:27.100 --> 24:28.800
he assumes the boy was
molested.

24:31.700 --> 24:32.900
all right. thanks.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.700
he's not the one.
i'm sorry.

24:41.700 --> 24:42.900
you said it looked good.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.400
i was hopeful. i'm sorry.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.500
but he was videotaping
that funeral.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.100
we believe he's
a preferential sex offender.

24:49.100 --> 24:50.700
but he doesn't have michael.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.700
how many of these people
are out there?

24:54.700 --> 24:56.100
more than you want to know.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.200
hello.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.800
put the fbi on.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.600
i don't know
what you're talking about.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.300
i saw them there
at the funeral.

25:39.500 --> 25:40.700
put them on!

25:42.600 --> 25:44.300
this is special agent
aaron hotchner.

25:44.300 --> 25:45.700
you were trying to trick me.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.100
you were trying to lock me down 
but you arrested the wrong person.

25:49.100 --> 25:50.800
why don't we just
slow down and talk.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.700
we only have 3 minutes.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.800
no. we have
as long as we want.

25:54.900 --> 25:56.600
that's not the rules.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.300
ok. you're right.
your rules.

26:00.300 --> 26:02.400
it was good of you to go
to the funeral today.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.100
you must have really
cared about ethan.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.800
i loved him.
his parents didn't deserve him.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.500
i took good care of him.

26:09.100 --> 26:10.700
is that why you bought
him the new clothes?

26:10.900 --> 26:13.800
they put him in those silly blue sneakers
and lime green oxford.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.300
he hated those!

26:15.300 --> 26:18.100
well, maybe when you're
good enough to bring michael home,

26:18.400 --> 26:20.800
you can tell his parents
what he really likes.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.500
no. he's never coming home.

26:24.400 --> 26:27.700
i saw that so-called mother.
she looked right at me.

26:28.100 --> 26:29.900
she knows he sleeps
better with me.

26:31.500 --> 26:32.600
i don't know who you are.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.300
but please give me back
my son! please.

26:35.300 --> 26:37.900
i'm begging you.
i'll do anything.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.200
just don't hurt my baby.
please!

26:40.900 --> 26:42.200
your time is up.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.100
you were trying to trick me.

26:58.100 --> 26:59.300
no one was trying
to trick you.

26:59.300 --> 27:02.600
you were trying to lock me down
but you arrested the wrong person.

27:03.400 --> 27:06.300
would it be possible for us 
to work in private for a while?

27:06.500 --> 27:07.500
he was at the funeral.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.000
i told you.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.100
he was at the funeral,
and you arrested the wrong man.

27:11.100 --> 27:12.500
i don't think
it is a man.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.900
did you hear the way
she described the clothing?

27:14.900 --> 27:17.600
she said the blue shoes.
lime green oxford.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.600
a male wouldn't reference
specific details like that.

27:20.700 --> 27:21.600
i think reid's right.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.400
she talked about
what the child wanted.

27:23.700 --> 27:25.500
how he slept.
how she took care of him.

27:25.500 --> 27:26.600
she said, "i loved him."

27:26.600 --> 27:29.700
a male unsub would have
emphasized the competition, not the care giving.

27:29.700 --> 27:32.200
he would have talked
about how he was smarter than the f.b.i.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.800
bragged about not being caught.

27:33.800 --> 27:38.500
- we could have been looking at both men and women--
- the statistics are overwhelming.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.200
women abduct newborns.
men take children.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.000
garcia.

27:42.000 --> 27:42.900
i'm right here, sir.

27:43.300 --> 27:45.300
will you run the license plates
the police gave you

27:45.300 --> 27:47.400
and find any that might be
registered to a woman.

27:47.900 --> 27:48.800
that would be...

27:48.800 --> 27:49.500
PARAMETERS:REGISTRANT = FEMALE

27:49.500 --> 27:49.600
MATCHING RESULTS: 0

27:49.600 --> 27:50.700
MATCHING RESULTS: 0
zero.

27:50.700 --> 27:51.600
how's that possible?

27:51.600 --> 27:54.700
transcript almost reads like she's been
institutionalized.

27:54.700 --> 27:55.700
you mean she's crazy.

27:55.700 --> 27:57.700
she described herself
as being "locked down"

27:57.700 --> 27:59.600
not "arrested"
or "put away."

27:59.800 --> 28:04.000
plus, most mental facilities
are very rigid about the amount of phone ???

28:04.000 --> 28:07.400
i think her talking about only having 3 minutes
isn't her rule to us.

28:07.400 --> 28:10.100
it's what she's been institutionalized
to think of as normal.

28:10.200 --> 28:15.400
garcia, can you get records of women released 
from mental institutions this past month?

28:15.400 --> 28:17.800
she most likely has some
trauma in her case file--

28:17.800 --> 28:19.600
possibly the death of a child.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.500
i'm sorry. i can't do that.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.700
to protect patient privilege
there's no central database.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.700
i could hack
each hospital individually,

28:26.700 --> 28:30.300
but even then,
most diagnoses are kept separately BY THE DIFFERENT DOCTORS.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.600
i think
i might have a way.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.200
dr. reid.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.800
your mom didn't tell me
you were in town.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.800
she doesn't know i'm here.
i'm working on a case.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.700
and i actually thought
you might be able to help us.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.600
of course.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.100
you've read about the recent
child murder and second abduction?

28:49.100 --> 28:49.800
yes.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.600
we think the person
responsible is a woman.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.000
she would have been
institutionalized.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.400
but we believe she may have been released
within the past few weeks,

28:55.400 --> 28:57.100
just before the first abduction.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.200
what can i do?

28:58.200 --> 29:02.600
i'm assuming you have a good working relationship 
with the administrators at other hospitals.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.000
i know no one can open their files.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.400
but if you wouldn't mind
just giving them the profile,

29:06.400 --> 29:07.900
that would be a tremendous help.

29:08.100 --> 29:09.900
she's delusional.
fueled by grief.

29:09.900 --> 29:13.600
very well might have lost a child of her own, 
probably around the age of 5.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.000
i'll see what i can do.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.300
spencer?

29:27.700 --> 29:29.000
what are you doing here?

29:29.300 --> 29:30.700
i'm here for work.

29:30.700 --> 29:34.700
we're investigating the murder and abduction
of two 5-year-old boys.

29:34.700 --> 29:39.300
<i>i don't like the idea of you working on things
that are so sad.</i>

29:39.300 --> 29:40.300
i know.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.800
you're so thin.

29:44.900 --> 29:47.700
i was going to come see you the second
we solved the case.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.600
what else is going on
in there?

29:51.700 --> 29:52.200
nothing.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.200
don't lie to your mother,
spencer.

29:54.700 --> 29:55.700
we know.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.300
we feel things.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.800
try to remember the moment when
you felt someone's eyes on you.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.800
i don't know.

30:10.900 --> 30:11.900
yes, you do.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.800
at one point you said,
"he's here."

30:15.300 --> 30:16.200
when was that?

30:23.300 --> 30:24.200
it's her.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.000
garcia, the blonde in the middle.
do you have her?

30:26.200 --> 30:27.000
got her.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.600
isolate the image.
run it through vicap.
see if we get a hit.

30:29.700 --> 30:30.500
on it.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.100
did i know a boy
named riley jenkins?

30:42.700 --> 30:44.000
riley jenkins...

30:45.200 --> 30:46.700
he was a story you made up.

30:46.700 --> 30:50.700
no. no. he was a real kid who was murdered
when i was 4 years old.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.500
oh, i think you're mistaken.

30:56.100 --> 30:57.500
i've been seeing things.

30:58.300 --> 30:59.400
don't say that.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.700
i've been having dreams about his death
since i was little, mom.

31:02.700 --> 31:05.500
you were always a reader.
it affected your dreams.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.800
i remember, when i was 4,
we went to a funeral.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.700
your uncle daniel's, maybe?

31:14.100 --> 31:15.500
i also remember
we moved houses.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.100
and you and dad
argued about it.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.300
and you told dad
that i was in danger.

31:19.300 --> 31:20.400
because you were.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.000
why--why did you think that?

31:22.100 --> 31:25.800
i don't know. i just knew.
i told you. a mother knows.

31:26.100 --> 31:29.700
we're animals, spencer.
we feel things.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.700
i'm sorry. i talked to the heads of
9 different hospitals.

31:32.700 --> 31:35.200
there's no one who matches
your description.

31:35.900 --> 31:36.900
thank you for trying.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.800
you know, if this person has
an axis-1 condition,

31:40.100 --> 31:43.900
her release wouldn't be as important as 
whether or not she keeps to her medications.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.300
all right. thank you.
again, thank you very much.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.600
i went off my medication
when i was pregnant with you.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.700
i spent every day in terror,
but i made it.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.700
and it was beautiful.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.400
i had you.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.600
oh, god.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.400
what is it, baby?

32:06.700 --> 32:08.600
women abduct newborns.

32:09.700 --> 32:10.800
excuse me.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.400
i don't understand.

32:12.400 --> 32:15.400
doctor, would it be possible for a woman to convince herself

32:15.400 --> 32:18.500
that a random 5-year-old child's actually her own newborn?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.700
if her psychosis is strong enough.

32:20.700 --> 32:24.400
and, again, if they'd stopped 
taking their medication, absolutely.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.000
thank you. thanks.

32:30.800 --> 32:35.000
hotch, i'm pretty sure i know why 
the medical examiner was so confused.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.600
i think she's
breastfeeding them.

32:41.700 --> 32:43.000
mommy's here.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.600
there we go.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.800
there ya go.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.600
mommy's here.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.900
get some sleep now, ok?
mommy's here.

33:18.600 --> 33:19.900
i got a hit off the woman
on the video.

33:19.900 --> 33:21.800
i ran it through vicap.
her name's claire bates.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.700
she was institutionalized 3 years ago

33:23.700 --> 33:26.800
after she assaulted a fellow
secretary at a law firm.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.600
by that i mean,
she bit off part of her ear.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.800
do we have an address?

33:29.800 --> 33:31.000
there's no last known.

33:31.100 --> 33:32.600
try running
the license plates again.

GARCIA, PULL HER BIRTH RECORDS.
 IF SHE'S REALLY BREASTFEEDING THEM,

33:45.700 --> 33:47.300
then she must
have just given birth.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.600
here we go.
claire bates...

33:50.600 --> 33:51.400

33:54.700 --> 33:55.500
oh...

33:55.500 --> 33:56.700
what is it, garcia?

33:56.800 --> 34:00.200
social services removed the baby 
from her care after a 7-day evaluation.

34:00.300 --> 34:02.400
that's why she holds
the boys for 7 days.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.000
she's recreating
the loss of her baby.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.200
but she's taking
5-year-olds.

34:05.200 --> 34:09.000
her psychosis must be projecting her baby
 onto any children she can get access to.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.699
garcia, can you read us
the social services report?

34:14.100 --> 34:17.000
"while it is admirable that patient stayed off
anti-psychotic medication

34:17.000 --> 34:18.300

j.j. will stay here with you. 
we'll call with any updates.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.500
tell reid where we're going.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.000
watch yourselves.
if she's truly delusional,

35:05.000 --> 35:07.800
she'll have moments of clarity
where she realizes what she's done.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.000
morgan and i'll go
around back.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.600
prentiss and i'll
take these doors.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.400
claire!

35:34.300 --> 35:35.200
stop, claire!

35:35.300 --> 35:36.500
she's going out the back.

35:38.500 --> 35:39.800
careful. she's got the boy!

35:45.600 --> 35:46.600
hotch, we got her!

35:50.300 --> 35:51.700
she's going to the garage!

36:08.100 --> 36:12.200
claire, back away from the fire
and put him down.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.700
my baby's dead.

36:14.100 --> 36:15.100
no, he isn't.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.100
he's being taken really good
care of by someone else.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.600
just like you need to take
care of this boy.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.400
i kept healthy.
i did good.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.600
we know you did.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.900
we just need you to step away
and put the boy down.

36:48.900 --> 36:50.600
my baby's dead.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.500
no. he isn't, claire.
let us prove it to you.

37:02.100 --> 37:03.700
do you have
a clean shot of her?

37:03.700 --> 37:05.100
she's not armed, rossi.

37:05.200 --> 37:08.100
if he's still alive
and she drops him in the fire,

37:08.100 --> 37:09.800
we may not be able to save him.

37:19.700 --> 37:21.400
do you have a shot?

37:22.900 --> 37:24.400
yes. i got one.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
i've got michael!
i've got michael!

37:36.800 --> 37:37.800
i got ya.

37:39.700 --> 37:41.000
no, don't do it!

38:38.700 --> 38:41.700
a doctor has to check him out,
but you can be with him
the whole time.

38:41.700 --> 38:45.200
he should be able to be back
in his bed by tonight.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.200
thank you.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.100
thank you.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.800
you're gonna be great.

38:59.800 --> 39:00.700
i know.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.500
you know, this is about as good a day 
as we're gonna get on this job.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
i know.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
and yet you're still thinking about a boy 
you're not even sure if you really knew.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.700
when i was 4, my mother had a sense 
that i was in danger.

39:26.800 --> 39:29.500
reid,
your mother wasn't well.

39:30.300 --> 39:31.800
i know facts about the case.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.500
reid, you've got a photographic memory.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.200
odds are, you saw the story.

39:35.300 --> 39:37.000
he was just a kid like you.

39:37.400 --> 39:38.800
and it caught your imagination.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.300
i don't really think that you believe that.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.200
you wanna know what i really believe?

39:43.500 --> 39:45.300
i believe you could have done anything 
in the world with your life

39:45.300 --> 39:47.100
and you chose
to do this job.

39:48.300 --> 39:51.900
your man carl jung says our unconscious
 is the key to our life's pursuits.

39:53.700 --> 39:55.400
yeah. yeah.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.000
so, for whatever reason,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.500
that case was stuck in your
brain all these years

40:00.900 --> 40:03.200
and it not only led you
to this career choice

40:03.500 --> 40:05.100
but to the same city
where your mother lives

40:05.100 --> 40:07.700
and for us to have the opportunity to save this child.

40:10.900 --> 40:11.900
yeah.

40:12.700 --> 40:16.300
like i said, this is about as good a day
as we're gonna get, man.

40:17.600 --> 40:18.700
enjoy your moment.

40:24.500 --> 40:28.700
hotch, do you think it would be possible 
to wait until tomorrow to return home?

40:30.200 --> 40:32.400
do you think you could find something to do 
in las vegas for the night?

40:39.100 --> 40:40.300
bob dylan once said,

40:40.900 --> 40:46.700
"i think the truly natural things are dreams, 
which nature can't touch with decay."

40:48.200 --> 40:49.900
i'm proud of you, spencer.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.100
for what?

40:51.300 --> 40:52.500
saving that boy.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.400
how'd you know?

40:54.700 --> 40:56.600
i told you. a mother knows.

40:58.100 --> 41:01.500
dr. norman gave me permission 
to sleep on the couch in your room tonight

41:01.500 --> 41:04.000
if it's all right with you.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.700
if anyone tries to keep him
in here any longer,

41:08.700 --> 41:10.500
i'll scratch your eyes out.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.000
one night only.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.000
it helps if they think
you're crazy.

41:17.500 --> 41:18.500
they don't argue.

41:22.500 --> 41:27.700
Bob Dylan "Shelter From the Storm"

41:27.700 --> 41:30.000
* 'twas in another lifetime *

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
* one of toil and blood *

41:32.000 --> 41:36.600
* when blackness was a virtue,
the road was full of mud *

41:36.600 --> 41:41.000
* i came in from the wilderness,
a creature void of form *

41:41.000 --> 41:46.800
* "come in," she said, "i'll give you shelter from the storm." *

41:53.700 --> 41:55.900
* and if i pass this way again *

41:55.900 --> 41:58.000
* you can rest assured *

41:58.000 --> 41:59.900
* i'll always do my best
for her *

41:59.900 --> 42:02.300
* on that i give my word *

42:02.300 --> 42:04.300
* in a world of steel-eyed
death and men *

42:04.300 --> 42:06.700
* who are fighting to be warm *

42:06.700 --> 42:11.500
* "come in," she said, "i'll give you shelter from the storm." *

42:15.700 --> 42:18.000
* not a word was spoke
between us *

42:18.000 --> 42:20.800
* there was little risk
involved *

42:20.800 --> 42:25.200
* everything up to that point
had been left unresolved *

42:25.200 --> 42:26.800
* try imagining a place *

42:26.800 --> 42:29.000
* where it's always
safe and warm *

42:29.000 --> 42:33.900
* "come in," she said, "i'll give you shelter from the storm." *

42:48.000 --> 42:48.900
fbi.

42:50.500 --> 42:51.900

43:09.300 --> 43:10.600
