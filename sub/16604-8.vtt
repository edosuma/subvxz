a place here at Hopkins Academy?

He earned his scholarship

27:31.810 --> 27:33.244

and very little sober supervision.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.214
You know, the kids see
that round and round,

30:57.215 --> 30:58.849
they think it's a ride.

30:58.850 --> 31:01.051
There's a real danger of suffocation.

31:01.052 --> 31:03.887
So, uh, in through that door there,

31:03.888 --> 31:06.390
all the way in the back by the kitchen.

31:06.391 --> 31:09.393
Unplug the washing machine and
deliver it to this address.

31:09.394 --> 31:12.030
A neighbor's agreed to
take it off our hands.

31:23.041 --> 31:24.842
Mr. Gallagher, if you would like to say

31:24.843 --> 31:27.278
anything on your own
behalf, now is the time.

31:30.582 --> 31:35.552
My father, uh, he has
kind of a brilliant mind.

31:35.553 --> 31:37.955
You know, and that's...

31:37.956 --> 31:40.257
That's a pretty hard
thing for me to admit,

31:40.258 --> 31:42.393
because he's such a
waste of space and all,

31:42.394 --> 31:46.397
but... you know, it's true.

31:46.398 --> 31:49.266
He could have been a college graduate,

31:49.267 --> 31:52.069
but instead, he dropped out,

31:52.070 --> 31:56.340
uh, he fucked up his kids,

31:56.341 --> 31:59.843
and he drinks, and does drugs.

31:59.844 --> 32:03.213
That's his whole life.

32:03.214 --> 32:06.216
I want to be around people
like Professor Youens.

32:06.217 --> 32:09.220
And Professor Runyon, even though she...

32:14.559 --> 32:16.560
It's minds like theirs...

32:16.561 --> 32:18.495
um...

32:18.496 --> 32:22.232
you know, these minds
that... That are brilliant,

32:22.233 --> 32:25.202
you know, and they aren't wasted.

32:25.203 --> 32:28.338
I, uh, I don't have any big ideas

32:28.339 --> 32:30.040
about what I want to do with my life,

32:30.041 --> 32:33.410
but this morning I was washing dishes

32:33.411 --> 32:36.246
at the diner where I work,

32:36.247 --> 32:40.284
and Professor Youens called
me, and I thought...

32:40.285 --> 32:42.553
"I miss that."

32:42.554 --> 32:45.422
You know, I don't miss
the kids who grew up

32:45.423 --> 32:49.793
so privileged they didn't
even know what they had.

32:49.794 --> 32:51.161
But I miss being around people

32:51.162 --> 32:53.030
with minds like Professor Youens',

32:53.031 --> 32:55.632
you know, and I think

32:55.633 --> 32:58.502
if I could get a couple
more years of that,

32:58.503 --> 33:01.638
I'd have a real good shot at, uh...

33:01.639 --> 33:04.875
making some better choices
than my father made.

33:04.876 --> 33:07.911
I don't blame anybody
else for what I did,

33:07.912 --> 33:10.915
and I do regret it.

33:13.585 --> 33:15.052
But if you guys would have me back,

33:15.053 --> 33:18.989
I-I promise, you know, I'll...

33:18.990 --> 33:21.993
I'll do better.

33:24.028 --> 33:25.729
Thank you.

And we don't even know
if he's alive or dead.

33:29.167 --> 33:30.834

33:30.835 --> 33:33.370
Or even related to her.
We don't know anything.

33:33.371 --> 33:35.706
We can't trust anything.

33:35.707 --> 33:37.608
And the craziest part of it all

33:37.609 --> 33:40.110
is that V doesn't even seem to care.

33:40.111 --> 33:42.746
It's like she's pussy-whipped.

33:42.747 --> 33:45.415
(GROANS)

33:45.416 --> 33:47.885
I feel like V...

33:47.886 --> 33:50.822
might be in love with her more than me.

33:56.828 --> 34:01.398
If you could talk now,
that would be awesome.

34:01.399 --> 34:05.702
Uh, it's hard to know what to say.

34:05.703 --> 34:08.505
Why, 'cause it's all so messed up?

34:08.505 --> 34:12.509
No, because I know that you're...

34:12.510 --> 34:14.478
You're practically married to Svetlana,

34:14.478 --> 34:16.847
so I don't want to say anything
now that I can't take back later

34:16.848 --> 34:18.982
if you're just gonna
go home and make up.

34:18.983 --> 34:23.320
Because that makes me the
asshole, like, forever.

34:23.321 --> 34:26.056
I need you to tell me the truth.
That's what I'm here for.

34:29.286 --> 34:31.321
Okay.

34:33.786 --> 34:37.389
I never trusted Svetlana,
not for a single minute,

34:37.391 --> 34:39.190
not since the day that I met her,

34:39.192 --> 34:40.860
because I was raised by a con artist,

34:40.860 --> 34:42.995
so I know one when I see one.

34:42.996 --> 34:44.864
And when V married her to
keep her in the country,

34:44.864 --> 34:47.533
I understood because she was providing

34:47.534 --> 34:49.068
childcare and help with the bar,

34:49.069 --> 34:52.237
and I thought it's about convenience.

34:52.239 --> 34:56.007
But then it got really weird.

34:56.009 --> 34:59.178
And then the next thing I know,
my best friend is married to

34:59.179 --> 35:03.516
and in love with a Russian
hand whore con artist

35:03.517 --> 35:05.251
who's turned her against
me, so it's too late

35:05.252 --> 35:06.619
for me to say anything about it,

35:06.620 --> 35:08.754
which is maybe the biggest
mistake of my life,

35:08.755 --> 35:11.824
because I miss her every fucking day.

Okay.

51:25.131 --> 51:27.766
I don't know how to say thank you.

51:27.767 --> 51:30.769
How 'bout you let me
crash on your couch?

51:30.770 --> 51:32.037
Sure.

51:32.038 --> 51:35.274
Well, uh, hey, um,

51:35.275 --> 51:38.377
would you happen to have a
spare bed for your old pops?

51:38.378 --> 51:40.679
(BOTH) No.

51:40.680 --> 51:43.849
(ETTA) Looks like a
party in here, Wendell.

51:43.850 --> 51:47.152
Show those kids how it's done.

51:47.153 --> 51:48.487
(MOUTHING WORDS)

51:48.488 --> 51:51.623
Dead husband.

51:51.624 --> 51:54.559
Does she still have an
apartment upstairs?

51:54.560 --> 51:56.428
No.

51:56.429 --> 51:57.562
Liar.

51:57.563 --> 51:59.264
<i>(JAZZ MUSIC)</i>

51:59.265 --> 52:01.600
(GASPS)

52:01.601 --> 52:03.302
This is my song.

52:03.303 --> 52:06.072
(LAUGHING)

52:07.573 --> 52:10.909
Remind me, darling, do we
have a double bed upstairs?

52:10.910 --> 52:11.777
- Uh-huh.
- Ah.

52:11.778 --> 52:12.844
(FIONA) Frank.

52:12.845 --> 52:15.247
It's cold out there, Fiona.

52:15.248 --> 52:16.982
You can stay on the floor in the back

52:16.983 --> 52:18.850
if you leave Etta out of it.

52:18.851 --> 52:21.153
Deal.

52:21.154 --> 52:23.622
(LAUGHING)

52:25.958 --> 52:28.093
That's right. Here we go.

52:28.094 --> 52:30.462
- Whoo.
- Again, yes.

52:30.463 --> 52:32.455
