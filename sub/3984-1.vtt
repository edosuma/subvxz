WEBVTT

02:09.360 --> 02:10.964
We shouldn't be out here alone.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.041
Why not?

02:12.120 --> 02:13.121
If your father...

02:13.200 --> 02:14.964
He'll never know we're gone.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.565
But if he finds out...

02:20.760 --> 02:23.491
You don't need to be afraid of my father.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.163
Are you sure?

02:52.760 --> 02:53.761
Yes.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.970
We shouldn't go in.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.327
Of course we should.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.129
Get out! Get out!

03:45.200 --> 03:46.247
- Let's go.
- No.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.640
Listen to your friend.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.727
They said that you were terrifying,

03:52.800 --> 03:55.929
with cat's teeth and three eyes.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.002
You're not terrifying.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.284
You're boring.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.403
You don't know what I am.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.768
I know you're a witch
and you can see the future.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.210
Tell me mine.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.601
Everyone wants to know their future

04:12.680 --> 04:14.284
until they know their future.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.921
This is my father's land. My land.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.446
Tell me my future,

04:19.519 --> 04:23.286
or I'll have your two boring eyes
gouged out of your head.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.284
Your blood.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.441
Give me a taste.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.482
Three questions you get.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.447
You won't like the answers.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.566
I've been promised to the prince.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.369
When will we marry?

05:16.440 --> 05:18.283
You will never wed the prince.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.403
You will wed the king.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.005
But I will be queen?

05:22.080 --> 05:23.320
Oh, yes.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.163
You'll be queen.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.410
For a time.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.921
Then comes another,

05:32.000 --> 05:33.001
younger,

05:33.920 --> 05:35.763
more beautiful,

05:35.840 --> 05:40.004
to cast you down and take all you hold dear.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.048
Will the king and I have children?

05:42.120 --> 05:46.125
No. The king will have 20 children,

05:46.240 --> 05:47.480
and you will have three.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.647
That doesn't make sense.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.290
Gold will be their crowns.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.805
Gold their shrouds.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.805
Come on, we have to go.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.130
We have to go! Cersei.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.329
Bearers, put it down.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.608
Bearers, up.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.611
Away.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.165
Your Grace, we are honored
by your presence.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.401
The mourners are waiting.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.084
They will keep waiting.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.889
I want a moment alone with him.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.610
But, Your Grace,
many of these lords and ladies

06:57.680 --> 07:00.923
have traveled day and night
to be here from all seven kingdoms.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.445
They will wait.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.530
He never wanted you to be a Kingsguard,

07:32.080 --> 07:35.482
but here you are, protecting his dead body.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.364
What he built, it's ours.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.406
He built it for us. He meant it for us.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.365
- They're going to try to take it away. All of it.
- They?

07:50.440 --> 07:53.205
All of them out there. Our enemies.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.842
They're waiting in line
to make sure he's really dead.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.763
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

07:57.840 --> 07:59.524
they'll set to work on tearing us apart.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.365
They have nothing to do with it.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.602
The man who murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.967
He's the enemy.
I've been telling you for years.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.530
You've been defending him for years.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.931
This is exactly what they want.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.002
And now our father is dead,

08:12.080 --> 08:15.289
and that little monster
is out there somewhere drawing breath.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.842
Did you set him free?

08:22.720 --> 08:27.169
Tyrion may be a monster,
but at least he killed our father on purpose.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.241
You killed him by mistake.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.001
With stupidity.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.004
You're a man of action, aren't you?

08:35.080 --> 08:37.207
When it occurs to you to do something,
you do it.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.648
Never mind the consequences.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.409
Take a look.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.963
Look at the consequences.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.242
Here they are.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.129
He loved you more than anyone in this world.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.363
Apologies.

10:42.360 --> 10:48.481
I still don't see why I had to stay
in this fucking crate once we set sail.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.528
I saved your life.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.251
If they catch you, they catch me.

10:53.320 --> 10:57.405
I cannot say I feel overly guilty
about leaving you in that fucking crate.

10:57.480 --> 11:01.883
Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit
through one of those air holes?

11:01.960 --> 11:06.204
No, I only know what it's like
to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.205
Pentos?

11:12.240 --> 11:16.689
The home of my colleague,
Illyrio Mopatis, a merchant.

11:16.760 --> 11:20.731
He and I met many years ago
through mutual friends.

11:20.800 --> 11:24.646
A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon
for the disaster he was.

11:25.680 --> 11:30.561
We tried to do what was best for the realm
by supporting a Targaryen restoration.

11:31.520 --> 11:36.242
And thus began the chain of mistakes
that has led us both here.

11:36.640 --> 11:40.201
Things have gotten worse, not better.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.489
Westeros needs to be saved from itself.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.241
Mmm.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.491
Much better.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.484
My lord?

11:54.280 --> 11:56.886
I don't think I am anymore.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.489
A lord.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.124
Are you a lord if you kill your father?

12:11.480 --> 12:16.725
I don't imagine they revoke your nobility
for killing a whore.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.604
It must happen all the time.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.808
You already drank yourself
across the Narrow Sea.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.248
In a box. Why stop now?

12:23.320 --> 12:26.244
Because we are talking
about the future of our country.

12:30.320 --> 12:33.210
The future is shit.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.002
Just like the past.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.166
You want the same?

14:30.640 --> 14:31.846
Same as always?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.006
You...

14:45.160 --> 14:46.924
you don't have to.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.845
Habit.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.250
The Sons of the Harpy?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.322
Yes, Your Grace.
They left it on the body.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.164
They've never killed before.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.447
It was only a matter of time, Your Grace.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.727
Conquerors always meet with resistance.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.121
I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.328
They do not see us as people, Your Grace.

16:00.720 --> 16:04.486
Then they will have to learn to see
things differently, Mossador.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.841
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

16:07.920 --> 16:09.570
so cowards in masks could take it away.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.968
And I did not take up residence
in this pyramid

16:12.040 --> 16:15.965
so I could watch the city below
decline into chaos.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.202
What was the name of the man you lost?

16:18.640 --> 16:19.926
White Rat, Your Grace.

16:21.240 --> 16:24.164
I want him buried with honor, publically,

16:25.440 --> 16:26.601
in the Temple of the Graces.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.688
The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.290
Make them very angry.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.362
Angry snakes lash out.

16:33.440 --> 16:36.171
Makes chopping off their heads
that much easier.

16:36.240 --> 16:40.290
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.765
Your Grace.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.810
I wanted to speak with you.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.201
Why do you come?

17:17.280 --> 17:20.329
White Rat, the Unsullied who...

17:22.280 --> 17:25.284
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

17:26.760 --> 17:32.290
I have heard that more than one Unsullied
has been known to visit Meereen's brothels.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.849
May I ask you why?

17:38.720 --> 17:41.326
Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?

17:45.480 --> 17:47.642
I do not know.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.204
I must go.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.843
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.049
If it wasn't heavy, it wouldn't stop a sword.
Now get it up.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.246
Come. Try it again.

18:27.320 --> 18:31.245
Drive at me. Keep your shield up,
or I'll ring your head like a bell.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.882
Shouldn't you be training, too?

18:35.520 --> 18:38.763
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

18:41.240 --> 18:44.801
How many brothers can say that
they've killed a White Walker and a Thenn?

18:44.880 --> 18:46.325
I might be the first in history.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.843
- Shield up.
- These men need a firm hand.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.687
Always have.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.645
They're poachers and thieves.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.289
Not soldiers.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.007
That one hates me.

19:06.840 --> 19:09.241
If Ser Alliser is chosen
as the new Lord Commander...

19:10.240 --> 19:12.811
He hates the wildlings.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.645
All the wildlings.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.882
- Don't let them send us away.
- It's not a sure thing.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.770
Ser Denys Mallister has commanded
the Shadow Tower for 20 years,

19:20.080 --> 19:22.560
and people say he's a good man.
He's running against Ser Alliser...

19:22.680 --> 19:25.001
Sam, don't let them send us away.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.249
I told you.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.802
Wherever you go, I go, too.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.042
You can't leave. They'll execute you.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.890
Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.

19:43.760 --> 19:44.761
Shield up.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.488
The king wants a word.

20:17.840 --> 20:18.921
You're not cold, my lady?

20:19.720 --> 20:21.324
Never.

20:22.160 --> 20:25.084
The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.361
Feel.

20:36.920 --> 20:37.967
Are you a virgin?

20:42.720 --> 20:44.131
No.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.486
Good.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.171
Your Grace.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.406
The bastard of Winterfell.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.963
You know who rules at Winterfell now?

21:11.440 --> 21:12.566
Roose Bolton.

21:12.680 --> 21:16.730
Hmm. The traitor who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.565
Don't you want to avenge him?

21:20.880 --> 21:24.202
I want a great many things, Your Grace.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.408
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.850
I've been talking to your sworn brothers.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.570
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.324
Many don't.

21:33.640 --> 21:37.440
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.046
Why?

21:39.120 --> 21:40.690
It's where she belonged.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.082
Some of the Night's Watch feel you have
too much affection for the wildlings.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.323
They were born on
the wrong side of the Wall.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.164
That doesn't make them monsters.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.321
No matter.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.971
I shall take back the North
from the thieves who stole it.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.651
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

21:55.720 --> 21:59.805
I shall mount Roose Bolton's head
on a spike.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.763
But if I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.806
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part...

22:04.880 --> 22:06.928
I'm not talking about
the damn Night's Watch.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.929
I'm talking about the wildlings.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.125
Your Grace,

22:19.280 --> 22:22.762
you want the wildlings
to march in your army?

22:22.840 --> 22:24.569
If they swear to follow me,
I'll pardon them.

22:24.640 --> 22:25.687
We'll take Winterfell.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.491
Once the North is won,
I'll declare them citizens of the realm.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.891
I'll give them land to live on.

22:30.760 --> 22:34.128
It's a fair offer. More than fair.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.089
I'll offer them their lives
and their freedom

22:36.160 --> 22:39.130
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.641
I don't think that's likely.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.281
You admire him, don't you?

22:44.360 --> 22:45.850
I respect him.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.160
He likes you.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.403
- Convince him to bend the knee, or he burns.
- Your Grace.

22:54.560 --> 22:55.891
How much time do I have?

22:56.120 --> 22:57.360
Nightfall.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.847
The sun drops fast this time of year.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.684
Hurry, Jon Snow.

23:04.920 --> 23:05.967
Shield up.

23:06.360 --> 23:09.523
Attack, my lord!

23:09.640 --> 23:11.244
Attack!

23:11.760 --> 23:13.967
Don't cross your feet.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.769
My sons had swords in their hands
from the time they could walk. This one...

23:18.120 --> 23:20.043
Lord Arryn
will never be a great warrior.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.963
Great warrior?

23:22.080 --> 23:24.651
He swings a sword like a girl with palsy.

23:24.840 --> 23:25.887
My lord.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.410
Sword up, my lord!

23:37.040 --> 23:38.849
Some boys
develop more slowly.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.127
He's still young.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.204
He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.806
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

23:46.880 --> 23:49.008
The gift of a great name.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.642
Sometimes that's all one needs.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.490
Good-bye, Lord Royce,
and thank you for all you've done for me.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.961
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.405
I have no doubt that on my return,

24:04.480 --> 24:07.131
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.365
He'll be safe here.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.248
As for his skills,

24:12.440 --> 24:14.727
I make no promises.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.682
Will we head north at some point?

24:30.840 --> 24:34.287
He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.647
We're a few days' ride from the King's Road.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.087
- But that will take us...
- Us?

24:40.840 --> 24:42.126
The only reason you're here

24:42.200 --> 24:45.090
is because Jaime Lannister
told me you weren't safe in the capital.

24:47.240 --> 24:50.164
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.163
No one knows what you look like.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.244
No one cares. You're safe.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.085
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

25:00.360 --> 25:01.407
An attendant to a knight.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.045
I'm not a knight.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.248
That means you're not a squire.

25:05.480 --> 25:06.641
Well, where would I go?

25:06.720 --> 25:09.371
I don't care. I'm not your mother.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.083
You swore to find the Stark girls.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.846
I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.161
- Sansa still might.
- Will you shut your mouth?

25:26.280 --> 25:28.282
I didn't ask for your advice.

25:30.520 --> 25:34.047
I don't want anyone following me.
I'm not a leader.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.486
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

25:38.160 --> 25:41.801
The good lords are dead,
and the rest are monsters.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.846
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.285
I did.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.085
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.288
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

26:03.360 --> 26:06.523
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

26:06.600 --> 26:08.807
but he's not alone in that castle.

26:08.920 --> 26:12.925
Do you trust all those knights and ladies,
stable boys and serving girls?

26:13.000 --> 26:16.163
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

26:16.320 --> 26:18.084
No.

26:18.760 --> 26:19.921
But I pay them well,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.446
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

26:22.520 --> 26:23.646
So where are we going?

26:24.880 --> 26:27.247
To a land where you trust everyone?

26:27.320 --> 26:29.971
To a land so far from here,

26:30.040 --> 26:32.930
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.207
It was such a deep, deep shock to us all.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.483
Your father was a...

26:49.560 --> 26:52.370
A force to be reckoned with. He truly was.

26:54.040 --> 26:57.203
I wouldn't presume to claim
to have known him as such, but...

26:58.360 --> 26:59.805
But just being in his presence was enough

26:59.880 --> 27:01.484
to make it so clear

27:01.840 --> 27:04.730
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

27:05.080 --> 27:08.562
What a force to be reckoned with.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.287
Thank you so much for your kind words.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.323
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

27:19.400 --> 27:23.564
This tragedy... I never trusted Varys.
I often warned...

27:28.400 --> 27:29.401
Your Grace.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.681
Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.

27:34.760 --> 27:37.001
My deepest sympathies.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.210
I apologize for my son's appearance.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.725
Uncle, that's quite all right.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.405
They call themselves Sparrows.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.289
Bloody fanatics.

27:49.360 --> 27:53.331
Religion has its place, of course,
but at a certain point...

27:54.240 --> 27:57.084
They never would have come
to the capital when Tywin was alive.

27:57.160 --> 28:00.448
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,
whatever it is.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.288
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.286
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

28:25.520 --> 28:28.569
It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.483
What can I do for you?

28:33.800 --> 28:35.802
You can forgive me.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.406
What could you possibly have done
to warrant my forgiveness?

28:38.960 --> 28:41.167
I led you into the darkness.

28:41.280 --> 28:43.726
I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.610
I tempted you into our...

28:46.680 --> 28:48.125
unnatural relations.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.648
And, of course, there was the king,

28:55.680 --> 28:57.648
his boar hunt.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.327
His wine.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.481
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.282
I'm a different person now.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.684
I've found peace in the light of the Seven.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.246
You can, too.

29:15.320 --> 29:19.166
They watch over all of us,
ready to dole out mercy

29:19.920 --> 29:20.921
or justice.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.762
Their world is at hand.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.005
I will pray for your father's soul.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.561
The day Tywin Lannister's soul
needs your help...

29:45.840 --> 29:48.446
- It looks like Dorne.
- It doesn't.

29:49.640 --> 29:50.880
It does.

29:51.680 --> 29:55.730
That's the Sunspear bit, right there.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.405
And that's where the mountains are.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.562
And over here is...

30:02.200 --> 30:04.806
Is Sunsnake?

30:05.160 --> 30:06.207
Stonespear?

30:06.280 --> 30:07.884
Sandstone.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.450
Yes.

30:09.520 --> 30:11.761
Yes, Sandstone.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.561
Just there.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.286
Fine.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.725
It's Dorne.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.924
We should go there.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.649
I think we would have a lovely time,

30:27.760 --> 30:29.808
Judging by my experience.

30:29.880 --> 30:30.881
That would be wonderful.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.561
Dorne, Highgarden.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.809
Anywhere but here.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.450
We're late for dinner as it is.

30:47.880 --> 30:48.927
You're very respectful.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.809
I'm very hungry.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.410
What's your name?

31:10.320 --> 31:11.810
Olyvar, my lady.

31:12.120 --> 31:17.126
I'm afraid my brother
is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.

31:26.600 --> 31:27.931
My lady.

31:41.520 --> 31:45.320
Perhaps you might consider
being a bit more discreet?

31:45.400 --> 31:47.004
Why?

31:47.080 --> 31:49.048
They all know about me anyway.

31:49.360 --> 31:52.489
Everybody knows everything about everyone.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.608
What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?

31:54.680 --> 31:57.729
In any event,
you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.170
My intended? Please.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.931
Tywin's dead.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.968
That means no one
can force Cersei to marry me.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.929
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.162
You think I want that woman
married to my brother?

32:09.320 --> 32:13.006
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.208
Which means she stays in King's Landing.

32:15.520 --> 32:19.366
Which means you're trapped here
with Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.

32:19.680 --> 32:20.681
Perhaps.

32:21.840 --> 32:22.841
Perhaps?

32:24.240 --> 32:26.049
Perhaps.

32:39.400 --> 32:43.291
Eunuch, the spider,
the Master of Whisperers.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.967
Imp, halfman.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.209
There are faster ways to kill yourself.

32:50.320 --> 32:52.243
Not for a coward.

32:52.320 --> 32:55.369
You are many things, my friend,
but not a coward.

32:59.880 --> 33:00.881
You never told me why

33:01.240 --> 33:02.366
you set me free.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.522
Your brother asked me to.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.004
Could have said no.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.367
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.681
Not as dangerous as releasing me.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.321
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.324
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.767
I didn't do it for you.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.842
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

33:21.920 --> 33:25.163
A drunken dwarf will never be
the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.288
I don't believe in saviors.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.802
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

33:32.360 --> 33:35.330
You're going to have to find
another soldier.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.205
I'm done with Westeros,
and Westeros is done with me.

33:38.920 --> 33:42.811
You have many admirable qualities,
self-pity is not one of them.

33:43.760 --> 33:48.402
Any fool with a bit of luck
can find himself born into power.

33:48.480 --> 33:52.280
But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.571
I'm not well-suited for work.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.051
I think you are.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.805
You have your father's
instincts for politics,

33:58.880 --> 34:00.041
and you have compassion.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.407
Compassion? Yes.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.843
I killed my lover with my bare hands.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.810
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.849
I never said you were perfect.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.804
What is it you want exactly?

34:15.880 --> 34:17.370
Peace.

34:18.239 --> 34:19.810
Prosperity.

34:20.120 --> 34:23.203
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.521
Where the castles are made of gingerbread,

34:25.600 --> 34:28.170
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.601
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

34:30.679 --> 34:33.001
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.922
Perhaps.

34:35.000 --> 34:40.245
And perhaps we've grown so used to horror,
we assume there's no other way.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.762
If you sat on the Iron Throne,

34:43.840 --> 34:46.127
would you spread misery
throughout the land?

34:46.199 --> 34:48.931
I will never sit on the Iron Throne.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.764
No, you won't.

34:50.840 --> 34:55.971
But you could help another climb those steps
and take that seat.

34:56.040 --> 34:58.884
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

34:58.960 --> 35:01.281
but gentler than Stannis.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.762
A monarch who can intimidate
the high lords and inspire the people.

35:05.080 --> 35:09.847
A ruler loved by millions with a
powerful army and the right family name.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.202
Good luck finding him.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.367
Who said anything about "him"?

35:19.360 --> 35:21.408
You have a choice, my friend.

35:21.480 --> 35:26.202
You can stay here at Illyrio's palace
and drink yourself to death,

35:26.280 --> 35:29.807
or you can ride with me to Meereen,
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

35:29.880 --> 35:32.406
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.841
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

35:49.240 --> 35:52.084
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

35:52.160 --> 35:55.164
Looks like your friends
haven't been behaving themselves.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.004
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.367
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

36:03.440 --> 36:08.002
to a council of elders made up of both
the freed men and the former slaveholders.

36:08.080 --> 36:11.129
All matters of consequence
will be brought to you for review.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.850
Good.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.445
They did ask for some concessions.

36:15.480 --> 36:16.891
Concessions?

36:17.040 --> 36:19.122
Politics is the art of compromise,
Your Grace.

36:19.200 --> 36:22.090
I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.211
Forgive me. You're right, of course.

36:25.400 --> 36:29.166
Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects
than angry ones.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.802
I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy.

36:32.040 --> 36:35.123
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.124
They do not ask for the return of slavery.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.885
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.405
The fighting pits?

36:43.560 --> 36:46.006
Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

36:46.080 --> 36:50.165
In the new world that you've brought to us,
free men would fight free men.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.122
The pit fighters you liberated
pled for this opportunity.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.643
Bring some here and ask them yourself.

36:57.720 --> 36:58.721
No fighting pits.

36:58.920 --> 37:01.321
Opening them would
show the people of Yunkai and Meereen

37:01.400 --> 37:02.970
that you respect their traditions.

37:03.080 --> 37:06.084
I do not respect
the tradition of human cockfighting.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.247
If you...

37:07.320 --> 37:09.607
How many times must I say no
before you understand?

37:11.640 --> 37:14.405
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.926
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

37:17.000 --> 37:18.240
You should reopen the fighting pits.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.290
What?

37:22.360 --> 37:24.886
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.286
She liked to drink pear brandy.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.930
The older she got,

37:31.000 --> 37:34.004
the less she made selling her body,
the more she wanted to drink.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.764
So one day when I was 12,

37:36.840 --> 37:40.003
she sold me to a slaver
she fucked the night before.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.044
I'm sorry.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.771
Why? I was a bad child.

37:46.040 --> 37:49.647
I wasn't big, but I was quick

37:49.720 --> 37:50.926
and I loved to fight.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.289
So they sold me to a man in Tolos
who trained fighters for the pits.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.806
I had my first match when I was 16.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.605
You were sold into slavery,

37:59.680 --> 38:02.126
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

38:02.200 --> 38:04.282
and you're defending the fighting pits?

38:05.360 --> 38:08.330
I'm only here because of those pits.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.721
I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer,

38:10.800 --> 38:13.451
a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight.

38:13.560 --> 38:14.846
Soon I was famous.

38:14.920 --> 38:18.925
Ten thousand men and women screamed
my name when I stepped into the pit.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.971
I made so much money for my master,
he set me free when he died.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.528
I joined the Second Sons,

38:25.600 --> 38:27.250
and then I met you.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.203
You're the queen.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.681
Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth.

38:38.040 --> 38:40.247
Everyone but me.

38:40.920 --> 38:44.402
You've made thousands of enemies
all across the world.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.165
As soon as they see weakness,

38:47.240 --> 38:48.924
they'll attack.

38:49.360 --> 38:52.842
Show your strength here, now.

38:52.920 --> 38:55.161
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

38:57.680 --> 39:00.923
Anyone with a chest full of gold
can buy an army of Unsullied.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.046
You're not the Mother of Unsullied.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.650
You're the Mother of Dragons.

39:13.760 --> 39:17.765
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

39:18.520 --> 39:21.126
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

39:21.480 --> 39:24.131
For all I know,
he's flown halfway across the world.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.889
I can't control them anymore.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.284
A dragon queen with no dragons

39:36.160 --> 39:38.162
is not a queen.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.649
Viserion?

40:48.120 --> 40:49.929
Rhaegal?

41:01.720 --> 41:03.006
Easy. Easy.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.930
Easy.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.048
So here we are.

41:47.120 --> 41:49.122
Here we are.

41:51.360 --> 41:54.011
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

41:54.920 --> 41:58.163
And now, for our last meeting...

42:00.200 --> 42:02.567
This doesn't have to be our last meeting.

42:02.640 --> 42:05.166
No, but it will be.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.961
You know what Stannis wants?

42:10.040 --> 42:12.520
He wants me to bend the knee.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.967
And he wants the free folk to fight for him.

42:16.160 --> 42:19.130
I'll give him this much, he's bold.

42:19.280 --> 42:20.884
Shouldn't a king be bold?

42:21.280 --> 42:22.805
Oh, aye.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.010
I respect him.

42:26.240 --> 42:29.210
If he gets what he wants,
I expect he'll be a better ruler

42:29.280 --> 42:33.126
than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.567
But I'll never serve him.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.725
You told me you weren't here to conquer.

42:38.800 --> 42:40.040
You told me your people have bled enough.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.491
That's right.

42:42.320 --> 42:44.687
I don't want them
bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.

42:44.760 --> 42:50.563
You spent your life convincing 90 clans to
come together for the first time in history.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.688
Thenns and Hornfoots,

42:52.760 --> 42:55.604
the ice-river clans, even the giants.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.649
A life's work uniting them.

42:57.760 --> 43:01.845
You didn't do it for power.
You didn't do it for glory.

43:02.360 --> 43:03.850
You brought them together to save them

43:04.440 --> 43:07.523
because none of them will survive the winter,
not if they're north of the Wall.

43:07.640 --> 43:09.768
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

43:10.320 --> 43:12.049
Pride?

43:14.160 --> 43:16.208
Fuck my pride.

43:18.520 --> 43:20.568
This isn't about that.

43:22.360 --> 43:26.046
Then bend the knee and save your people.

43:27.760 --> 43:31.128
They followed me because they respected me.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.964
Because they believed in me.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.281
The moment I kneel for a southern king,
that's all gone.

43:35.360 --> 43:38.648
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

43:38.760 --> 43:40.888
How many women?
How many children?

43:41.840 --> 43:45.049
And you won't go out
and rescue them because why?

43:45.280 --> 43:47.123
You're afraid of looking afraid.

43:47.720 --> 43:50.530
Oh, I am afraid.

43:51.600 --> 43:52.931
No shame in that.

44:02.600 --> 44:03.840
How will they do it?

44:04.240 --> 44:05.605
Beheading?

44:06.600 --> 44:08.045
Hanging?

44:11.800 --> 44:13.245
They'll burn you alive.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.208
Bad way to go.

44:23.920 --> 44:25.763
I'll be honest with you.

44:25.840 --> 44:28.002
I don't want to die.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.684
And burned to death?

44:29.760 --> 44:34.607
I don't want people to remember me like that,
scorched and screaming.

44:34.920 --> 44:38.003
But it's better than
betraying everything I believe.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.489
And what happens to your people?

44:41.160 --> 44:44.562
You preserve your dignity and die standing,

44:44.640 --> 44:46.768
and they'll sing songs about you.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.441
You'd rather burn than kneel.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.204
The great hero.

44:52.360 --> 44:55.648
Until winter comes,
and the White Walkers come for us all,

44:55.720 --> 44:58.121
and there's no one left to sing.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.288
You're a good lad.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.801
Truly you are.

45:06.400 --> 45:08.164
But if you can't understand

45:08.240 --> 45:12.290
why I won't enlist my people
in a foreigner's war,

45:13.480 --> 45:15.881
there's no point explaining.

45:31.960 --> 45:33.849
I think you're making a terrible mistake.

45:35.640 --> 45:39.565
The freedom to make my own mistakes
was all I ever wanted.

46:49.720 --> 46:53.167
Mance Rayder, you have been
called the King-beyond-the-Wall.

46:53.240 --> 46:55.720
Westeros only has one king.

46:56.280 --> 46:58.282
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

47:12.160 --> 47:13.764
Kneel and live.

47:21.720 --> 47:25.088
This was my home for many years.

47:27.280 --> 47:30.887
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

48:13.640 --> 48:15.324
We all must choose.

48:16.560 --> 48:20.087
Man or woman, young or old,

48:20.160 --> 48:23.448
lord or peasant, our choices are the same.

48:23.520 --> 48:27.286
We choose light, or we choose darkness.

48:27.360 --> 48:30.045
We choose good, or we choose evil.

48:30.560 --> 48:34.690
We choose the true god or the false.

48:46.080 --> 48:47.650
Free folk,

48:48.240 --> 48:50.083
there is only one true king,

48:50.720 --> 48:53.200
and his name is Stannis.

48:53.280 --> 48:55.601
Here stands your king of lies.

48:55.680 --> 48:58.843
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.
