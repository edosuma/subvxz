WEBVTT

00:02.567 --> 00:06.355
You're a fatty fatty fatty...

00:06.655 --> 00:08.327
What's your son doing?

00:08.531 --> 00:10.601
Apparently, he's doing
the "fatty" dance.

00:10.825 --> 00:11.894
Inappropriate?

00:12.077 --> 00:15.592
Well, maybe, but I'm raising my son
to be a straight shooter.

00:15.872 --> 00:19.182
- That's his mom right over there.
- Oh, thanks for including me.

00:19.459 --> 00:22.451
<i>Dr Cox and Jordan weren't
the only ones with kid troubles.</i>

00:22.712 --> 00:24.703
<i>My brand-new girlfriend was pregnant,</i>

00:24.923 --> 00:26.834
<i>and we were trying to
decide what to do.</i>

00:27.050 --> 00:29.200
- Should we keep it or get rid of it?
- I don't know.

00:29.427 --> 00:32.259
If we keep it,
it'll just end up in the dumpster.

00:32.514 --> 00:34.709
Okay, enough pizza talk.
I mean, we're clearly stalling here.

00:34.933 --> 00:39.051
- You're right.
- So let's go. Do you like kids?

00:39.354 --> 00:42.471
Of course I do. What about you?
Any nieces or nephews?

00:42.732 --> 00:44.802
Yeah, I have a nephew,
although he's 45.

00:45.026 --> 00:46.823
But occasionally,
I do have to change his diaper.

00:47.028 --> 00:48.905
- He was kicked by a horse.
- Oh, no.

00:49.114 --> 00:52.151
Yeah. Now, how do you feel
about adoption?

00:52.409 --> 00:56.880
So, beautiful, I hope you
keep some ice in this locket

00:57.205 --> 00:59.560
'cause you're making me hot all over.

00:59.791 --> 01:02.783
Actually, it's the only picture I have
of my biological father.

01:03.044 --> 01:07.640
- Do you want to see it?
- What? Oh, sure.

01:07.966 --> 01:11.436
I'll take a look at it
first thing tomorrow morning, huh?

01:11.720 --> 01:13.517
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of adoption.

01:13.722 --> 01:17.476
- You think if it's a girl you'd doink her?
- I know I will.

01:17.767 --> 01:21.396
Yup. All right. Well, look, we don't need
to make this decision tonight, right?

01:21.688 --> 01:24.327
- I mean, plenty of time...
- I'm totally fine with stalling.

01:24.566 --> 01:26.841
Great, because if I hear the word
"baby" one more time,

01:27.068 --> 01:28.387
I'm gonna lose it!

01:28.570 --> 01:31.209
Dude, Carla's in labour!
Meet me at the apartment!

01:31.448 --> 01:34.485
Go, go, go!

01:34.743 --> 01:37.780
- Is he coming? Is he coming?
- Turk, she's barely in labour.

01:38.038 --> 01:40.233
Oh, he's not talking about the baby.

01:40.457 --> 01:42.527
He's here,
and now we can have our baby!

01:42.751 --> 01:45.106
Okay, Brown Bear,
commence Operation Brown Cub.

01:45.337 --> 01:46.770
- Suitcase.
- Check.

01:46.963 --> 01:48.191
- Stylish big daddy hat.
- Check.

01:48.381 --> 01:51.100
- Big-time collegiate drum line.
- Check.

01:53.845 --> 01:57.474
I want the whole world to know
my baby's having a baby!

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.983 --> 02:09.338
Maybe we should just take your car.

02:33.635 --> 02:36.137
Okay, ladies, we're here. Calm down.

02:36.221 --> 02:41.136
What the hell took you so long?
Oh, my God. Did you stop for food?

02:41.476 --> 02:44.707
We had to, honey. J.D. promised
the band that we'd feed them.

02:45.563 --> 02:49.351
Yeah, let me get 23 cheeseburgers,
23 milkshakes...

02:49.651 --> 02:53.246
Miguel, if you don't stop drumming,
you're not getting fries.

02:54.656 --> 02:58.126
Twenty-three... You know what?
Twenty-two fries.

02:58.410 --> 03:01.243
Twenty-two fries.
You didn't think I'd do it, did you?

03:01.830 --> 03:06.062
Miguel has such raw talent, but his
attitude keeps getting in the way.

03:06.626 --> 03:09.982
Yay, congratulations, whoopee.
All right, see you.

03:14.467 --> 03:16.742
We are so happy for you.

03:23.310 --> 03:24.709
He's so sweet.

03:26.521 --> 03:29.911
You put one of those inside me.
What are we going to do?

03:30.942 --> 03:33.172
Turk, you brought my suitcase, right?

03:35.989 --> 03:38.457
Of course I have your suitcase, honey.

03:45.415 --> 03:47.292
What are you doing?

03:47.500 --> 03:51.254
Sometimes, when you need a miracle,
you have to pray extra, extra hard.

03:51.546 --> 03:53.855
- You wanna help me out?
- Fo' shizzle.

04:07.979 --> 04:09.458
Please, Lord...

04:19.324 --> 04:20.552
Nothing.

04:21.868 --> 04:23.984
Baby, changed my mind.

04:24.204 --> 04:26.843
- I don't have your suitcase.
- Turk, what the hell?

04:27.082 --> 04:31.121
It's okay, it's okay, Carla, because
I packed you an extra overnight bag,

04:31.419 --> 04:33.216
and you're all checked in
and I got you an orderly

04:33.421 --> 04:35.013
to take you to your room.

04:36.299 --> 04:38.096
Yeah, I'm only
four months pregnant, ace.

04:38.301 --> 04:39.859
Yeah, I think you're looking for me.

04:40.053 --> 04:42.362
Move it along before I eat you!
Chop-chop!

04:45.850 --> 04:47.078
Sorry, Jack, the machine's broken.

04:47.268 --> 04:49.702
Looks like you're gonna have to guzzle
your juice down without any ice.

04:49.938 --> 04:54.728
- Pretend... You know, pretend it's gin.
- What's gin?

04:56.778 --> 04:58.336
Gin is an alcoholic beverage,

04:58.530 --> 05:01.602
which, if your mommy's strong genes
are any indication,

05:01.866 --> 05:04.983
you'll eventually learn to love
as it slowly destroys

05:05.245 --> 05:07.600
a giant portion of your adult life.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.058
First the fat lady, now this?

05:12.252 --> 05:14.971
He's three, Perry.
Do you have to be so blunt with him?

05:15.213 --> 05:18.011
I'm not gonna BS my own kid.
What's the big deal?

05:18.258 --> 05:19.771
Hiya, sport!

05:19.968 --> 05:22.528
- Your skin is wrinkly.
- Yeah?

05:22.762 --> 05:24.912
Well, that shirt you're wearing is gay.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.597
Hey, baby, I know things haven't
exactly gone smoothly so far,

05:31.855 --> 05:34.130
but I promise you
I'm about to make it up to you.

05:34.357 --> 05:36.154
I spent all weekend
talking to my cousin,

05:36.359 --> 05:39.829
who just so happens to be
the world's biggest blerd.

05:40.113 --> 05:41.592
That's a black nerd.

05:41.781 --> 05:44.978
Anyway, he taught me everything
about streaming video

05:45.243 --> 05:47.996
and now, thanks to me,
your sisters in Chicago

05:48.246 --> 05:51.079
will be able to witness the birth
of our child live via webcam.

05:51.333 --> 05:54.689
- Turk, that's so sweet.
- You know, I do what I do.

05:54.961 --> 05:57.191
All we gotta do is
wait for the cameraman to get here.

05:57.422 --> 05:59.378
"Cameraman"?

05:59.591 --> 06:03.345
No man's gonna be filming my pooter
unless he's completely asexual.

06:03.845 --> 06:06.518
- Hello!
- Oh, hey, Ted. Cool.

06:06.765 --> 06:10.997
All right, I'm gonna go tell your sisters
that this bad boy is about to pop off.

06:13.063 --> 06:16.100
All right, Carla,
let's check how dilated you are.

06:16.775 --> 06:22.725
Looking real good, Carla.
Okay, we're live in three, two, one...

06:24.491 --> 06:27.324
Okay, looks like you're at
about three centimetres.

06:27.577 --> 06:30.455
Greatest show ever.

06:32.499 --> 06:34.251
And record.

06:37.462 --> 06:39.930
<i>Cool, Swamp Thing.</i>

06:41.007 --> 06:42.599
What's that, Daddy?

06:43.510 --> 06:47.105
Oh, that's the vagina
of a 35-year-old Latina woman.

06:49.683 --> 06:51.002
Baby?

06:59.985 --> 07:01.623
What the...

07:06.032 --> 07:08.068
J.D., we have to talk about
all of our pregnancy options,

07:08.285 --> 07:10.003
even if they make us uncomfortable.

07:10.203 --> 07:13.195
There's one way of dealing with this
that no one's mentioned yet.

07:13.456 --> 07:15.253
- The "A" word.
- I know.

07:15.458 --> 07:17.130
- Abortion.
- Appletinis.

07:17.335 --> 07:18.324
What?

07:18.503 --> 07:21.813
I thought that we could discuss
abortion over Appletinis.

07:24.134 --> 07:26.409
Did somebody just say "abortion"?

07:28.555 --> 07:32.787
Laverne, with all due respect, this is
none of your business or Jesus'.

07:34.060 --> 07:36.369
I believe he would beg to differ.

07:38.690 --> 07:42.000
She's right, J.D. Every life is precious.

07:42.277 --> 07:45.508
But what if having this baby
is a huge mistake for us?

07:47.324 --> 07:52.557
Okay, I'm gonna make this real simple.
No abortions, okay?

07:53.204 --> 07:54.956
- But what if...
- No abortions.

07:55.165 --> 07:56.120
Let me finish.

07:56.291 --> 07:58.168
What if the parents were,
like, abusive drug-addicts

07:58.376 --> 07:59.604
who would neglect their kid?

07:59.794 --> 08:01.750
Oh, well, in that case, it'd be okay.

08:01.963 --> 08:03.794
- Really?
- No abortions!

08:04.007 --> 08:06.202
How are you not getting this?

08:07.927 --> 08:09.076
This sucks.

08:09.262 --> 08:11.139
I mean, the hardest decision
I've had to make in the last year

08:11.348 --> 08:12.303
was what hairstyle to get,

08:12.474 --> 08:14.351
<i>and even then all I did
was open up an Us Magazine,</i>

08:14.559 --> 08:16.550
close my eyes
and pick a random celebrity.

08:16.770 --> 08:19.807
- Kirsten Dunst?
- Owen Wilson. Yeah.

08:20.607 --> 08:21.926
You know what's making this so hard?

08:22.108 --> 08:23.985
This relationship is so new,
we can't tell

08:24.194 --> 08:26.549
if we have a chance
of making this work long-term.

08:26.780 --> 08:28.293
You know what might
give us an inkling?

08:28.490 --> 08:31.209
We haven't technically had sex yet.

08:31.451 --> 08:35.568
That might help us find out
if we're on the same page, you know,

08:35.871 --> 08:38.227
- in the boudoir.
- Are you hitting on me?

08:38.457 --> 08:43.009
- I'm sorry. I'm being an idiot, aren't I?
- No. Clothes off, we're doing it.

08:46.675 --> 08:47.664
Yeah!

08:48.259 --> 08:50.693
All right,
we are definitely sexually compatible.

08:50.929 --> 08:53.921
I'm putting that down in the pro
"let's have a baby" category.

08:54.182 --> 08:55.297
That's exactly what we should do.

08:55.475 --> 08:57.147
We should make
a list of pros and cons.

08:57.352 --> 08:58.910
What did you two just do?

08:59.104 --> 09:02.494
Because I sure don't see
any wedding rings!

09:04.526 --> 09:06.676
Laverne, is this your Jesus?

09:11.533 --> 09:13.888
Turk, I got your shift covered
so you could hang here.

09:14.119 --> 09:17.429
Oh, and Carla, there's something
I wanted to tell you.

09:17.998 --> 09:19.351
Great vagina.

09:19.541 --> 09:21.930
- So helpful!
- Don't take it out on The Todd.

09:22.168 --> 09:23.965
He was just giving me a compliment.

09:24.170 --> 09:26.730
- Thank you, Todd.
- Hey, happy to say it.

09:28.091 --> 09:29.490
So, what's next, Turk?

09:29.676 --> 09:32.065
Because so far
I'm half-deaf from a drum line,

09:32.304 --> 09:34.943
I have no suitcase,
and the entire hospital has seen

09:35.181 --> 09:36.853
Ms Priscilla.

09:37.726 --> 09:40.479
I named her
after my high school art teacher.

09:41.187 --> 09:42.859
Oh, my God, so did I!

09:43.773 --> 09:47.209
Mr Hebler. "It's nice to meet you. "

09:49.988 --> 09:51.421
Okay, let me just read
the last of the cons.

09:51.615 --> 09:53.606
We're not married, we're both
totally focused on our careers,

09:53.825 --> 09:56.498
babies are known to be sticky,
and the average cost of raising a child

09:56.745 --> 09:58.417
is $400,000.

09:58.622 --> 10:00.294
Okay. Here are the final pros.

10:00.498 --> 10:02.329
Kids are great,
we both make good money,

10:02.542 --> 10:04.339
your boobs will get huge,

10:04.544 --> 10:07.377
I can finally buy Beanie Babies
without feeling weird,

10:07.631 --> 10:09.064
and kids are great...

10:09.257 --> 10:11.896
- Which you already said.
... tax deductions.

10:12.135 --> 10:13.932
- Oh, yeah, awesome.
- Oh, nice one.

10:14.137 --> 10:16.446
- All right, so then what's the final tally?
- Nice. Let's see.

10:16.681 --> 10:20.276
That's 20 cons and 19 pros.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.596
- I guess we gotta abort.
- Yup.

10:22.812 --> 10:26.691
Wait, I'm sorry.
That's an eyelash, I made a wish.

10:26.983 --> 10:29.213
- It's a tie. Abortion's off.
- Okay.

10:29.444 --> 10:31.002
So now what?

10:31.446 --> 10:33.641
<i>Every couple
has its share of problems.</i>

10:34.574 --> 10:36.326
Congrats, Perry. My son just asked me

10:36.534 --> 10:38.172
if my vagina
had ever been on television.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.167
And did you tell him
not since the late '80s

10:40.372 --> 10:42.442
when you were trying to
make it as an "actress"?

10:42.666 --> 10:44.019
<i>Whether it's someone digging in...</i>

10:44.209 --> 10:46.120
Will you just cut the crap
and stop treating your son

10:46.336 --> 10:47.530
like he's your drinking buddy?

10:47.712 --> 10:49.384
Jordan, I'm not going to change
who I am, all right?

10:49.589 --> 10:51.898
End of story. Jackie.

10:53.635 --> 10:55.751
<i>Or someone's stealing your thunder...</i>

10:55.971 --> 10:59.281
Okay, candles are all lit,
lavender-scented, your favourite.

10:59.557 --> 11:01.912
And here's a picture of your mom
to watch over you.

11:02.143 --> 11:04.532
And then I got this kit in case
you want to bronze the umbilical cord

11:04.771 --> 11:07.888
and use it as a key chain.
I practised at home on some calamari.

11:08.149 --> 11:09.741
Elliot, you're amazing.

11:09.943 --> 11:11.934
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

11:12.153 --> 11:14.303
Elliot's got everything covered.

11:17.575 --> 11:19.930
<i>Still, nothing's worse than
facing the biggest decision of your life</i>

11:20.161 --> 11:21.389
<i>and not getting anywhere.</i>

11:21.579 --> 11:24.969
Don't you wish it was this easy?
Heads yes, tails no.

11:43.101 --> 11:45.456
You don't see that every day.

11:51.651 --> 11:53.209
You know what?
We're getting nowhere.

11:53.403 --> 11:55.963
Let's split up for an hour
and do some soul-searching.

11:56.197 --> 11:59.667
- Where are you going?
- I was just gonna walk around.

11:59.951 --> 12:02.590
Why, where do you go
when you soul-search?

12:06.625 --> 12:09.822
All right, Justin,
what should my speciality be?

12:10.086 --> 12:12.316
Oncology or radiology?

12:15.759 --> 12:19.035
I go someplace wonderful.

12:19.304 --> 12:22.182
Anyway, I was thinking we need
new table linens for the dining room.

12:22.432 --> 12:25.390
Well, not so much table linens
as place mats.

12:25.644 --> 12:28.636
What do you think's prettier,
burgundy or mauve?

12:28.897 --> 12:30.615
- What the hell's with her?
- She's mad,

12:30.815 --> 12:32.214
but she can't give me
the silent treatment

12:32.400 --> 12:33.879
because she knows
I'd actually love that.

12:34.069 --> 12:37.141
So she's giving me talk-until-I-want-to-
commit-suicide treatment.

12:37.405 --> 12:39.919
- Sucks to be you.
- You have no idea.

12:40.659 --> 12:43.969
What else do I need for that?
Oh, I need new pillow shams

12:44.245 --> 12:47.521
and I like cotton, but I think
we should get a cotton blend

12:47.791 --> 12:50.908
because that's easier to clean
and I hate ironing.

12:51.711 --> 12:53.269
Maybe we need a new housekeeper.

12:53.463 --> 12:56.057
Maybe the housekeeper should come
every single day now.

12:56.299 --> 12:59.575
Look, Elliot, I'm really trying to be
involved in the birth of my child,

12:59.844 --> 13:01.436
but you just keep boxing me out.

13:01.638 --> 13:03.196
That is not true. Now, out of my way,

13:03.390 --> 13:04.618
I've gotta order
the birth announcements,

13:04.808 --> 13:08.278
put in the car seat
and find a yard to bury the placenta...

13:08.895 --> 13:12.126
Oh, my God, I'm a monster.
Turk, I am so sorry.

13:12.399 --> 13:14.674
- I just love babies so much.
- It's true.

13:14.901 --> 13:16.493
Sometimes she makes me
wear a diaper.

13:16.695 --> 13:17.844
Keith, private!

13:20.991 --> 13:23.903
- So, what is Elliot's plan?
- Oh, it's really simple.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.878
See, when Carla says, "I'm thirsty,"

13:26.079 --> 13:28.115
Elliot'll say,
"Oh, no, I forgot the ice chips. "

13:28.331 --> 13:30.686
That's when I walk in, ice in hand,

13:30.917 --> 13:34.751
and I say,
"Christopher Turk, at your cervix. "

13:35.547 --> 13:37.344
Should I have a baby, too?

13:37.549 --> 13:39.665
You know,
I'm a little preoccupied right now.

13:39.884 --> 13:43.399
- Why don't you ask your unicorn?
- This is way over Justin's head.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.911
He's never even been in love.
Not real love, anyway.

13:49.102 --> 13:51.013
What's up with the ice?

13:51.605 --> 13:52.799
I don't know what to do.

13:52.981 --> 13:55.620
I mean, having a baby can
completely ruin your life, you know?

13:55.859 --> 13:57.087
Not to mention, as a urologist,

13:57.277 --> 13:59.791
I have seen what childbirth can
do to you down there.

14:00.030 --> 14:01.702
I mean, I examined
this one woman last month

14:01.906 --> 14:05.296
and it was like, "Hello, hello, hello... "

14:05.577 --> 14:07.488
Not a good time, Kim.

14:09.539 --> 14:12.690
- Oh, God, I'm thirsty.
- Really?

14:12.959 --> 14:16.429
Unfortunately, I forgot the ice chips.

14:18.965 --> 14:20.080
Ice chips!

14:20.258 --> 14:23.614
- Dude, help. I'm totally stuck.
- Why don't you just yank it out?

14:23.887 --> 14:25.525
I would not do that.

14:26.723 --> 14:28.520
That's how it happened!

14:28.808 --> 14:31.686
Ice chips, ice chips,
ice-ice chips-chips!

14:32.812 --> 14:34.086
Hey, guys.

14:35.482 --> 14:37.438
Carla, let me just see
how far you can reach here.

14:37.651 --> 14:39.130
Okay, perfect.

14:39.319 --> 14:42.595
Turk would like you to call him
because he's stuck in an ice machine.

14:42.864 --> 14:43.899
What?

14:44.991 --> 14:47.459
See, that's why I took the precaution.

14:49.162 --> 14:51.437
Kim, would you be a sweetie
and give Turk a call for me?

14:51.665 --> 14:52.984
Yes, ma'am.

14:53.792 --> 14:57.148
Hey, baby, look, I...
Yeah, he's right here.

14:58.296 --> 15:00.890
- Hold on. She won't talk to me.
- Hi.

15:01.675 --> 15:04.189
Yes, I know,
he missed your wedding, too.

15:05.345 --> 15:06.937
All right, hold on.

15:07.681 --> 15:10.149
- That was from her, not me.
- Go.

15:12.352 --> 15:14.547
Relax, I'll have him out in one second.

15:14.771 --> 15:16.966
All right, now hold still.
Nobody likes a jagged stump.

15:17.190 --> 15:18.145
No!

15:20.318 --> 15:22.673
He's being unreasonable. Okay.

15:27.492 --> 15:28.766
That was from me.

15:32.289 --> 15:33.961
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.393
So, have you decided
what you want to do?

15:38.295 --> 15:40.251
You know what? Neither one of us
should have to go first.

15:40.463 --> 15:41.657
How about, on the count of three,

15:41.840 --> 15:43.114
we both say
what we think we should do?

15:43.300 --> 15:46.337
- Okay.
- One, two, three...

15:46.594 --> 15:48.152
- I got nothing.
- Appletinis.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.591
So, you guys gonna keep it?

15:50.807 --> 15:52.957
- There's a lot to...
- Maybe, but if we do, we can...

15:53.184 --> 15:54.583
- Because...
- Then we can...

15:54.769 --> 15:56.600
- Probably.
- Maybe not.

15:56.813 --> 15:59.532
You know, I had an abortion.

15:59.774 --> 16:01.446
All right, Jackie. As promised,

16:01.651 --> 16:04.040
let's go find ourselves
a little stethoscope

16:04.279 --> 16:06.509
so you can hear
what your butt sounds like.

16:06.740 --> 16:09.812
- Daddy, what's an abortion?
- Enjoy.

16:12.746 --> 16:13.974
My mommy had an abortion!

16:14.164 --> 16:16.632
My mommy had an abortion!
My mommy had an abortion!

16:16.875 --> 16:19.548
- My mommy had an abortion.
- How you doing?

16:21.588 --> 16:23.738
Okay, Janitor,
Carla's starting to push. Tell Turk.

16:23.965 --> 16:26.274
Got it. Your baby has a tail.

16:27.385 --> 16:29.615
I told her to stay away
from the microwave.

16:31.139 --> 16:33.972
- Elliot, I can't do it!
- Okay, okay, I want you to imagine

16:34.225 --> 16:36.022
that your uterus is
like a tube of toothpaste

16:36.227 --> 16:37.740
and you're just trying to squeeze out

16:37.938 --> 16:40.691
all that minty-fresh gel,
but instead of minty-fresh gel inside,

16:40.941 --> 16:42.932
there's a little black baby.

16:44.611 --> 16:48.001
We have a prolapsed umbilical cord.
She needs a C-section, right now.

16:48.281 --> 16:50.317
- Put Turk on the phone, damn it!
- It's okay.

16:50.533 --> 16:54.287
Baby, listen.
I'm not angry that you got stuck.

16:54.579 --> 16:57.298
I know you were just trying to be nice
because you're a good-hearted,

16:57.540 --> 17:00.293
wonderful, thoughtful man,
but listen to me.

17:00.794 --> 17:04.423
They're giving me a C-section,
and I'm really scared

17:04.714 --> 17:06.944
and I need you to be here right now.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.269
Something about a C-section. Smile.

17:20.689 --> 17:23.487
- Almost there?
- Almost there.

17:24.526 --> 17:27.643
- Baby! I'm here!
- Turk, I'm scared!

17:28.530 --> 17:31.840
- Sorry, Dr Turk, no ice machines.
- No!

17:34.869 --> 17:38.179
I was 19 and working in Nantucket
as a waitress

17:38.456 --> 17:40.890
and dating this amazing guy
named Andy.

17:41.793 --> 17:44.148
Curly blond hair and dimples

17:44.379 --> 17:48.008
and eyes that were either sky blue,
powder blue,

17:48.300 --> 17:50.530
I could never figure out which.

17:51.344 --> 17:54.097
Anyway, his best friend, Curt,
knocked me up.

17:55.724 --> 17:57.601
Don't look at me like that.
That was the first guy

17:57.809 --> 18:00.562
- I had ever slept with.
- Oh, we're not judging you.

18:00.812 --> 18:01.881
<i>Whore!</i>

18:02.063 --> 18:03.655
I think about it from time to time,

18:03.857 --> 18:07.213
but it would have been
the biggest mistake to have that baby.

18:07.485 --> 18:09.123
We've talked, we've made lists,

18:09.321 --> 18:11.312
and we've been as logical
as we can here,

18:11.531 --> 18:12.680
and we've still got nothing.

18:12.866 --> 18:16.381
It's not a logical decision.
If it's right, you'll feel it in your heart.

18:16.661 --> 18:19.255
Yeah, but what if
we don't feel anything?

18:20.165 --> 18:22.042
Maybe that's your answer.

18:25.503 --> 18:27.459
Carla's having a C-section.

18:32.427 --> 18:34.224
Jordan, you okay?

18:35.430 --> 18:39.548
- My mommy had an abortion.
- She sure did, sweetie.

18:41.603 --> 18:43.480
How are my boys?

18:47.067 --> 18:48.500
What's going on?

18:48.693 --> 18:51.730
- They're about to start.
- Turkleton!

18:52.656 --> 18:55.853
If you are trying to get
the same $5 million settlement

18:56.117 --> 18:58.187
that damn hook-handed
security guard got,

18:58.411 --> 19:00.686
you're out of luck, stud,
'cause I put a release button

19:00.914 --> 19:02.666
right here on top.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.553
Well, what are you waiting for, son?
Get in there.

19:15.720 --> 19:19.759
- How you doing, beautiful?
- Turk, you're here.

19:20.809 --> 19:22.128
I'm so hot.

19:23.144 --> 19:25.578
Don't sweat it. I got you.

19:32.529 --> 19:35.839
Guys, I have an announcement.

19:37.492 --> 19:39.005
Miguel, please!

19:39.703 --> 19:41.898
The baby's out, but the cord was
wrapped around its neck,

19:42.122 --> 19:44.397
so we had to take it to the NICU.

19:44.624 --> 19:46.660
<i>They say you never realise
your capacity to love</i>

19:46.876 --> 19:50.312
<i>until you have a child.
It can change who you are.</i>

19:50.588 --> 19:52.579
Where do babies come from?

19:55.176 --> 19:58.612
Where do babies come from? Well...

20:01.850 --> 20:06.685
When a mommy and a daddy
love each other very, very much,

20:08.023 --> 20:12.175
sometimes they close their eyes
and they make a wish.

20:17.907 --> 20:19.818
<i>It can fill you with joy.</i>

20:20.035 --> 20:23.266
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce you

20:23.997 --> 20:25.396
to Isabella Turk.

20:25.582 --> 20:28.574
I'm a daddy! I'm a daddy!

20:45.894 --> 20:47.043
<i>It can even give your heart</i>

20:47.228 --> 20:49.822
<i>the answer you thought
you'd never find.</i>

20:56.029 --> 20:57.542
Let's do this.
