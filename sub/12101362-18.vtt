WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.337
Previously on Dynasty...
You're my biological father?

00:04.379 --> 00:05.714
Yeah. It's true.

00:05.755 --> 00:07.424
Sometimes it would be nice
to see you

00:07.465 --> 00:09.050
as excited about our marriage
as you are about work.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.385
Liam, that's not fair.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.845
Sorry to interrupt date night.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.263
I just need
to see Fallon for a moment.

00:13.304 --> 00:15.306
I thought
she was at the office with you.

00:15.348 --> 00:16.933
You impress me more and more.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.309
The feeling's mutual.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.186
We might make
a good team after all.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.107
♪ Give 'em attitude... ♪

00:24.149 --> 00:27.777
(grunting)

00:27.819 --> 00:29.446
Oh, okay, okay, time out.

00:29.487 --> 00:31.364
I'm all for the "Float
like a butterfly" part, but

00:31.406 --> 00:33.158
I'm starting to take the "Sting
like a bee" a bit personally.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.617
Are you mad at me?
What?

00:34.659 --> 00:36.202
Of course not.
Well, then,

00:36.244 --> 00:37.662
you need to listen to
some Enya or something.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.039
You're aggro.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.498
I'm just a little on edge.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.042
My brother's on his way here

00:42.083 --> 00:43.877
to discuss some urgent matter
involving my dad.

00:43.918 --> 00:47.255
Hot brother Beto? How fun!

00:47.297 --> 00:48.798
(scoffs)
Or...

00:48.840 --> 00:50.425
not so fun?
I don't understand.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.885
I thought you two
were all good again.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.595
So did I.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.889
And then I never heard
from him after my surgery.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.390
Or my dad.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.434
Now I'm just expected to
drop everything for them?

01:00.393 --> 01:02.979
No. No more punching
until we talk this out.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.606
What is there to talk about?

01:04.647 --> 01:07.150
They ignored me
when I was dying.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.943
Well, maybe Beto's
coming here to apologize.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.071
At least hear him out
before you write him off.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.073
If it makes you feel any better,

01:13.114 --> 01:15.075
you can have him stay
at La Mirage.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.952
That'll give you a buffer
and me someone nice to look at.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.746
A win-win.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.457
Okay. Thank you, Sam.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.293
You're right.
I should give him a chance.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.796
Uh-huh. Thank you, Penny.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.380
(gasps)

01:29.422 --> 01:31.007
I knew it.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.717
You knew what?

01:32.759 --> 01:34.594
And why do you have to
know it when I'm sleeping?

01:34.636 --> 01:36.596
That was one of my cousins.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.891
Apparently,
there was an insurance dispute

01:39.933 --> 01:41.392
when one
of the Morell grannies

01:41.434 --> 01:42.894
kicked the bucket
a couple months ago,

01:42.936 --> 01:45.730
and my lovely sister Amanda
played dirty

01:45.772 --> 01:47.941
to get a fortune
she wasn't owed.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.609
And?
And she failed, but

01:49.651 --> 01:51.486
as part of her plan,
she pretended

01:51.528 --> 01:54.280
to be this, you know, prim and
proper princess, which, okay,

01:54.322 --> 01:56.908
she clearly is not,
and that's exactly what

01:56.950 --> 01:58.409
she's gonna do to Blake.
And you're basing

01:58.451 --> 02:00.036
all this off a few photos

02:00.078 --> 02:01.830
and a cousin
you've probably never met?

02:01.871 --> 02:04.457
Okay, first of all,
Polly and I are...

02:04.499 --> 02:06.543
Penny.
Yeah, Penny.
We're very close.

02:06.584 --> 02:10.046
And as the head of this family,
it's my job to find out

02:10.088 --> 02:11.798
what Amanda is up to
before she jets back to London

02:11.840 --> 02:13.633
with half of our dynasty.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.678
I mean, Who knows what this
walking keg stand has planned?

02:16.719 --> 02:18.847
Oh, that sounds like
a great use of your time.

02:18.888 --> 02:22.767
Okay, are we gonna talk
about what's going on with you?

02:22.809 --> 02:24.769
Because it couldn't be colder
in here.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.604
And it has been
ever since the other night.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.273
Oh, you mean the night
you decided

02:28.314 --> 02:30.859
our outdoor dinner wasn't
exciting enough for you?

02:30.900 --> 02:32.527
Wait. That's what this is about?

02:32.569 --> 02:34.279
I thought we agreed
that we were both at fault

02:34.320 --> 02:35.530
for how that played out.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.448
I think you agreed
more than I did.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.743
Look, I'm gonna take a shower
and hit the bouldering gym.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.370
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.913
Why don't you come
to the office today for lunch?

02:43.955 --> 02:45.832
Okay, we can plan a vacation.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.417
I think we could both use one.

02:47.458 --> 02:50.336
Sure, I'll see you later. I...
(phone ringing)

02:50.378 --> 02:51.921
Wait. It's my P.I.
Oh, my God.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.798
He's calling about Amanda stuff.
This is gonna be good.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.675
Hello? Talk to me.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.594
Purple?

02:57.635 --> 02:59.262
What? Next,
you're gonna be telling me

02:59.304 --> 03:01.931
I should put my preferred
pronouns on there, too.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.933
"Carrington for the future."
It's simple, exudes strength.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.393
Cavendish is

03:05.435 --> 03:06.811
ten points ahead in the polls.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.313
If I don't close that gap soon,

03:08.354 --> 03:09.856
the only thing
it exudes is delusion.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.441
And if I don't become senator,

03:11.482 --> 03:13.610
Primetime Private Air
never gets its airfield.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.737
You can go. Thanks.

03:16.779 --> 03:20.325
Is that really the reason you're
doing this-- for an airport?

03:20.366 --> 03:22.118
Well, I am not doing it
for the salary.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.953
No, I need some juice,
and purple's not gonna do it.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.915
All right. What about that
made-for-TV reunion with Amanda?

03:26.956 --> 03:28.791
Shouldn't that give you
a sympathy bump?

03:28.833 --> 03:31.586
Maybe, but not knowing I had
a daughter for the past 20 years

03:31.628 --> 03:33.463
is not exactly
father-of-the-year material.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.924
No, I need a big shift,
which is why

03:35.965 --> 03:40.053
I'm focusing on the demographic
I should be doing better with.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.930
Black voters?
Mm-hmm.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.473
My numbers are way down,
which is weird,

03:43.514 --> 03:45.558
because I'm usually beloved
by the Black community.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.851
Oh, you are?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.228
Yes, I had a great record

03:48.269 --> 03:49.729
with my hiring practices
at C.A.,

03:49.771 --> 03:52.065
not to mention the impact
the foundation had on...

03:52.106 --> 03:54.067
neighborhoods of color.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.777
So get out there
and tout that record.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.612
Yeah, well, if I'm gonna
remind the Black community

03:57.654 --> 04:01.241
how much they love me,
I need to really show I care.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.825
How are you gonna do that?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.535
By getting someone else
to tout my record for me.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.079
Hmm.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.081
I didn't know
about the cancer.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.667
I swear. I just
found out.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.253
How is that possible?
I left messages for Dad.

04:13.294 --> 04:16.881
There's a lot
going on back home.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.051
Detective Soto?
Uh-huh.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.053
I don't understand.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.471
Are you in trouble
with the Feds?

04:23.513 --> 04:25.223
Dad is. When the charges
started piling up,

04:25.265 --> 04:26.849
he decided to lie low.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.811
And the responsibilities
of the business fell on me,

04:29.852 --> 04:32.730
which is why
he probably kept me in the dark.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.191
He knew that I would
leave to be with you.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.694
It's also why I'm cooperating
with the authorities.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.572
We could use your help.
My help?

04:41.614 --> 04:43.032
With evidence
of international crime,

04:43.074 --> 04:44.909
they could arrest him today.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.619
You want me
to turn over evidence

04:46.661 --> 04:48.830
of the rigged gambling machines
at the Atlantix stadium?

04:48.871 --> 04:50.498
That's all they need.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.083
The Feds are pretty much
just waiting to grab him.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.501
He's still our father, Beto.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.003
I want out, Cristal.

04:55.044 --> 04:57.463
I want to have the freedom
to live my own life,

04:57.505 --> 04:59.507
the way you do.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.968
Hello.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.678
Sorry to interrupt.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.973
Here's your room key
and some drink tickets.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.184
Hey, Sam. Uh,
you're looking well.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.394
You, too.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.229
Thanks, Sam.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.398
But that won't be necessary.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.151
Beto's gonna stay at the manor.

05:18.192 --> 05:22.530
Oh. Well, feel free
to keep the drink tickets.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.032
(clicks tongue)

05:24.073 --> 05:25.825
FALLON:
So,

05:25.867 --> 05:28.244
our rising legal superstar?

05:28.286 --> 05:29.996
Turns out, she's not.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.873
She was fired
from her firm a month ago

05:31.914 --> 05:33.833
for highly confidential reasons.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.335
So I guess her full-time job

05:35.376 --> 05:36.753
is now coming
after the Carrington money?

05:36.794 --> 05:39.213
Exactly. And look at this.

05:39.255 --> 05:43.092
A petition for a name change?
She wants to become

05:43.134 --> 05:44.927
"Amanda Carrington"
after being here for two weeks?

05:44.969 --> 05:46.346
I need to put an end
to this today.

05:46.387 --> 05:47.638
Get something on the books.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.766
Excuse me?

05:50.683 --> 05:53.644
While I always enjoy
a good two-woman show,

05:53.686 --> 05:56.064
I thought we were going
to discuss the future

05:56.105 --> 05:57.648
of my stake in Fallon Unlimited.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.442
We are... in a minute.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.361
You're booked in shareholders
meetings through tomorrow.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.322
I can reschedule your lunch
with Liam.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.616
This Amanda thing's important.
He'll understand.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.618
I hope you're right.

06:08.659 --> 06:11.329
Okay, I guess I can call him
after my next meeting ends.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.122
Oh, he'll probably be
on the road by then.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.916
I'll handle it.
COLIN:
I don't know why

06:14.957 --> 06:17.251
you're getting so worked up
about this Amanda character.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.253
She seems fun.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.547
Is she single?
I don't know, but you're not.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.007
Incorrect.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.634
Divorced about a month ago,

06:24.675 --> 06:26.844
but that's besides
the point. Um,

06:26.886 --> 06:28.304
what do I have to do with this?

06:28.346 --> 06:32.016
I need you to pull
some posh British strings

06:32.058 --> 06:35.019
and get me some intel
on why Amanda was fired.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.771
This might come as a surprise,

06:36.813 --> 06:39.232
but I don't know everyone
in London.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.109
She was fired
from Buckley Chance,

06:41.150 --> 06:44.278
okay, the firm that your family
has on retainer.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.655
So, what do I get from this?

06:45.696 --> 06:47.573
You know, the satisfaction

06:47.615 --> 06:50.952
of helping out a fellow CEO
and board member?

06:50.993 --> 06:52.954
Actually, if you're desperate
enough to call me,

06:52.995 --> 06:56.124
then I'm setting
the terms myself.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.376
A favor of my choosing.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.044
No.
Well,

07:00.086 --> 07:02.380
guess you'll never know
why Amanda was fired.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.469
Fine. It's a deal.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.346
Although, I'm sure
I'll live to regret this.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.682
I'm sure we both will.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.101
That's what makes it so fun.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.606
♪ ♪

07:26.863 --> 07:29.532
Dominique, you've
been busy lately, huh?

07:29.574 --> 07:31.868
I hear you and Fallon
are working together.

07:31.909 --> 07:34.662
Yes, I'm prepping
for a photo shoot

07:34.704 --> 07:36.622
we're having in here
next week.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.791
Working hard for the money.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.751
Not really Carrington behavior.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.004
Well, you're a Carrington,
so I guess it is now, huh?

07:43.045 --> 07:45.673
You know, I've been
giving it some thought,

07:45.715 --> 07:47.550
and if you're not
too busy with this,

07:47.592 --> 07:49.802
I-I think that you should
join me on the campaign trail.

07:49.844 --> 07:53.264
Interesting. And why are you
asking me about this now?

07:53.306 --> 07:54.807
Well, I think it's important

07:54.849 --> 07:56.476
that the voters see us
as one, big happy family.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.770
Oh. I assumed it was because

07:59.812 --> 08:01.814
you're underperforming
with Black voters.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.900
But what do I know?

08:03.941 --> 08:06.819
Well, I could have
more than one reason

08:06.861 --> 08:09.322
for wanting my sister
by my side, can't I?

08:11.491 --> 08:14.619
This is as insulting
as it is transparent.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.037
Do you really think

08:16.078 --> 08:17.413
people aren't going to see

08:17.455 --> 08:18.664
through your little charade?

08:18.706 --> 08:20.124
It's not a charade.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.584
I'm serious when I say

08:21.626 --> 08:22.877
I want this to work
for everyone.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.795
Just need your support.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.214
Well,

08:26.255 --> 08:28.382
at least
you're being honest now.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.343
You know, if you're not gonna
do it for me,

08:30.384 --> 08:32.428
do it for yourself.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.264
Think of the benefits of having
a brother as a senator, right?

08:35.306 --> 08:37.350
All the doors it'll open,
a bigger profile,

08:37.391 --> 08:39.018
expanded social circle.

08:39.060 --> 08:43.648
True, if I could get a senator
wearing one of my suits,

08:43.689 --> 08:45.233
or even a First Lady,

08:45.274 --> 08:47.693
my business will skyrocket.
Exactly.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.279
We can discuss that,
you know, at some point.
Fine.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.074
But if I help,
we're doing it my way,

08:53.115 --> 08:55.159
no questions asked.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.874
That filet is a perfect 145
degrees. Why haven't you eaten?

09:01.916 --> 09:04.252
Oh, I'm sorry. I've been
going through my dad's stuff

09:04.293 --> 09:05.795
at the manor.
It's making me anxious.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.922
How many leather journals
can you possibly look at?

09:07.964 --> 09:09.549
Well, there's other stuff, too.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.342
I found out
he collected kookaburras.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.470
Like on stamps, plates,
little statuettes.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.056
Mm, lover of weird birds doesn't
go with the Anders I knew,

09:17.098 --> 09:18.766
but that does sound
vaguely familiar.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.184
Why is it making you anxious?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.353
It's not the birds.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.691
It's this.
What is that?

09:26.732 --> 09:28.359
It's a flash drive. I found it

09:28.401 --> 09:30.778
with a note on it telling me
to "watch upon my death."

09:30.820 --> 09:33.781
(laughs) Making demands
from beyond the grave?

09:33.823 --> 09:36.909
Now that's the Anders I knew.
What's on it?

09:36.951 --> 09:38.869
I don't know yet.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.289
It's dated from a few years ago,
and we weren't in a good place,

09:41.330 --> 09:42.915
so it's probably a lecture.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.917
Your father dials you
from the hereafter,

09:44.959 --> 09:46.877
and you're not taking his call?

09:46.919 --> 09:49.046
Oh, if that's not bad mojo,
I don't know what is.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.256
But I'm nervous.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.882
Just pop it in
and see what he says.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.427
If he starts yelling,
well, stop.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.095
I guess I can do that.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.973
I mean, it's not like
he can throw me out again.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.267
At least I don't think he can.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.270
As of this morning, the deed

10:04.312 --> 10:06.022
to that decommissioned
oil rig is mine,

10:06.063 --> 10:07.481
thanks to your intel.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.817
Glad I could help.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.570
Now I just need a senator to
sponsor a bill making it legal

10:12.612 --> 10:14.697
to launch rockets
off the coast of Georgia.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.407
I already spoke
to Blake's opponent.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.867
And what'd Cavendish have
to say?

10:17.908 --> 10:19.410
For my support, he's willing

10:19.452 --> 10:21.454
to introduce
the Georgia Offshore Space Bill

10:21.495 --> 10:23.998
within his first ten days
of office.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.834
Look, I know it was my idea
to support Cavendish,

10:26.876 --> 10:29.545
but the more I read up on his
politics, the more I worry.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.756
Look, I know
Cavendish isn't perfect, okay,

10:31.797 --> 10:33.758
but politics is all trades
and favors.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.551
If you support
him, too,

10:35.593 --> 10:37.762
you can negotiate
for some incentives of your own.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.348
Find that karmic balance.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.016
And at the end
of the day,

10:42.058 --> 10:44.018
anyone is better than Blake.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.312
Facts.
(laughs)

10:48.230 --> 10:49.732
Hey.

10:49.774 --> 10:50.858
You're here.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.902
Yeah. For lunch with Fallon.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.446
Like now?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.490
Fallon's at the manor
with her sister.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.450
She said that it was urgent and
that she was going to tell you.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.910
You've got to be kidding me.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.079
Actually, I think

11:03.120 --> 11:05.081
maybe I was supposed
to tell you myself.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.916
I am so sorry either way.

11:06.957 --> 11:09.210
It's-it's not your fault.
It's not about who's telling me.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.920
It's about what she's doing.
You... (laughs)

11:10.961 --> 11:13.130
You know what? Never mind.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.050
I'll let you get back to work.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.260
Oh, um, you have
a little something.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.096
Just...

11:20.137 --> 11:22.515
Oh, yeah. I just came from the
bouldering gym down the street.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.183
The chalk just gets everywhere.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.935
Atlanta Boulders?
Yeah.

11:25.976 --> 11:29.605
No way. I just joined
there a couple weeks ago.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.023
Maybe I'll see you
there some time.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.108
Yeah, that could be fun.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.734
Oh, in the meantime,

11:33.776 --> 11:36.445
enjoy a gluten-free vegan wrap
with dressing on the side

11:36.487 --> 11:39.240
because I know I won't.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.286
Oh, I don't think
I need another one.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.955
Thank you.
Oh, sure you do!

11:45.996 --> 11:47.373
It's important to
lay down a nice base

11:47.415 --> 11:49.375
of alcohol
before food arrives.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.043
And I still have more questions.

11:51.085 --> 11:54.505
Oh, really? Is this
a casual sister tea time,

11:54.547 --> 11:56.132
or a full-blown interrogation?

11:56.173 --> 11:58.718
I'm bad at small talk,
and I want to know

11:58.759 --> 12:02.555
as much as I can about my sister
before you go back to London.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.598
So, next question.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.392
Greatest fear?

12:06.434 --> 12:08.352
Is that really...?

12:08.394 --> 12:10.020
Um... (clears throat)

12:10.062 --> 12:12.982
Well, I'm a bit claustrophobic,
if you must know.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.359
Okay. Well,
I will tell the staff

12:15.401 --> 12:17.278
to put paper bags
in the panic room

12:17.319 --> 12:18.696
for the next time you visit.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.072
You see how important this is?

12:20.114 --> 12:21.449
Mm.
Oh, good!

12:21.490 --> 12:23.367
Look. The food is here.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.912
So, let's talk
about your career.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.664
An associate at Buckley Chance.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.624
I mean, that is pretty
impressive at such a young age.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.543
They must really like you.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.962
Yes, well, it was very gracious
of them to offer me a sabbatical

12:35.004 --> 12:37.256
so I could get
to know you all.
Hmm.

12:37.298 --> 12:41.260
Is "sabbatical" British for
"I got fired a month ago"?

12:43.304 --> 12:45.806
I wasn't fired.
I was forced out.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.601
Mm-hmm. That's what people
who were fired say.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.102
It doesn't really sound
any better.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.562
You know, there's much more
to the story,

12:51.604 --> 12:52.897
none of which is your business.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.398
Actually,
this family is my business.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.150
Well, I don't work for you.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.401
What's going on here?

12:59.195 --> 13:02.323
Hold that thought. Hey.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.074
I'm so happy you're here.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.327
I'm sorry I had
to reschedule, but now,

13:06.368 --> 13:09.497
you can help me finish off
Amanda and send her on her way.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.831
LIAM: This is why
you bailed on me?

13:10.873 --> 13:11.415
To destroy your sister?

13:13.375 --> 13:14.919
I'll pass. You don't need
my help with that.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.588
Wait. Liam, please.

13:20.424 --> 13:21.884
Ugh.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.886
Was quite the cold shoulder
back there.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.596
How long has that
been going on?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.014
Nothing's going on.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.599
Well, that's obvious.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.476
I mean, care to discuss it,
sister to sister?

13:30.518 --> 13:32.978
I am not talking
about my marriage with you.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.064
I understand. Well,

13:35.105 --> 13:37.441
don't worry. We'll have plenty
of time for that anyway.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.610
You know, I hadn't
made my mind up, but I think

13:39.652 --> 13:41.821
you've just convinced me
to stay in Atlanta.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.280
I don't think
that's a good idea.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.157
Well, why not?
As your snooping suggests,

13:45.199 --> 13:47.201
I don't have anything
to go home to.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.411
There's much more
for me right here.

13:49.453 --> 13:52.915
Anyway, thank you
for the treats.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.042
Mmm.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.342
I worry about you, Kirby.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.219
I worry about you
messing up your life

14:05.261 --> 14:07.346
in various different ways,
until eventually,

14:07.388 --> 14:09.807
I'm not around to fix it.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.851
I guess
since you're watching this,

14:11.892 --> 14:13.853
that point has been reached,

14:13.894 --> 14:16.772
so let me share
a few life lessons.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.441
Ugh. I knew
it was gonna be another lecture.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.319
Don't take everything
so personally.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.446
You fall for their tricks,
you take...

14:24.488 --> 14:27.241
There is one very important
person I need you to find.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.076
So write this down.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.079
In fact, I'll wait for a second
for you to get a pen.

14:32.121 --> 14:36.959
The address is
5295 Swafford Road.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.377
Her name is Victoria.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.670
I think you'll like her.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.672
She's a lot like you, actually.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.091
And she has something
very important to tell you

14:44.133 --> 14:45.634
that will change your life.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.304
What?
ADAM:
Kirby?

14:48.345 --> 14:49.722
Is that Anders?

14:49.763 --> 14:52.683
He left me this video
to watch, but

14:52.725 --> 14:55.185
now I think I might have
a secret sister.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.646
A sister? You sure?

14:57.688 --> 15:01.108
No. It could be a cousin.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.444
Wait. You're checking in on me.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.195
Does that mean
we're friends again?

15:05.237 --> 15:07.031
Let's not label things just yet.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.574
Uh, so, what are you gonna do

15:08.616 --> 15:10.993
about this, uh,
secret sister, cousin thing?

15:11.035 --> 15:13.954
I'm gonna meet this woman
and have my life changed.

15:13.996 --> 15:17.875
Equity and inclusion in hiring
were not just a priority at C.A.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.543
They were a guiding principle.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.129
So believe me when I say
that as a senator,

15:22.171 --> 15:24.840
I will do everything I can
to continue

15:24.882 --> 15:26.967
to improve the lives
of Black Georgians.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.303
Do you think you're the first
white politician

15:29.345 --> 15:32.014
who's come in here
making all kinds of promises

15:32.056 --> 15:34.099
to get our endorsement?

15:34.141 --> 15:36.101
Uh, well, I... I assume not.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.729
Um, but I am sincere.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.941
Everyone says they're sincere,
just-just like you.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.985
Well, if you help get my foot in
the door, we could build trust.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.613
And once they get elected--
thanks to us--

15:47.655 --> 15:49.740
do you know what happens next?

15:50.866 --> 15:52.826
Nothing.

15:52.868 --> 15:56.914
The Black community has
historically and consistently

15:56.956 --> 15:58.874
seen no benefit
from their vote.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.793
And then,
people like you

16:00.834 --> 16:03.504
come in here, thinking we can't
see what you're trying to do,

16:03.545 --> 16:05.214
but-but we can.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.466
Uh, we recognize pandering
when we see it.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.718
Reverend, I'm sorry if you...
No, don't be sorry.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.679
Instead of telling us
what you're gonna do,

16:11.720 --> 16:13.681
why don't you tell us
how you're gonna do it?

16:13.722 --> 16:15.432
That's what matters.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.644
Well, I would need some...

16:18.686 --> 16:21.063
I don't have all the answers
at the moment.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.691
I would have to take a look
at all the options.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.443
Yeah. That sounds about right.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.736
Hmm.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.573
My brother will put in the work,

16:31.615 --> 16:33.617
and get back to you
with more specifics.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.995
Thank you all for your time.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.413
Of course.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.373
Your mother was a dear friend.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.917
I know. She always spoke
so highly of you.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.836
Thank you all
for, um, listening.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.295
If there's anything else
I can do...

16:45.337 --> 16:46.797
Stop talking right now.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.174
Be blessed.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.511
Well, can't you get your contact
to move faster?

16:52.553 --> 16:54.096
I thought Brits were punctual.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.848
(laughs)

16:55.889 --> 16:57.850
Hilarious as always.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.977
All right. Bye, Colin.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.231
Who's Colin?
Adam!

17:04.273 --> 17:05.816
We talked about this!
Either wear a bell

17:05.858 --> 17:08.527
around your neck or
announce yourself.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.029
Okay, so, what's this emergency

17:10.070 --> 17:11.989
that you summoned me
from an actual emergency room?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.782
It's Amanda.

17:13.824 --> 17:17.161
She is poor, jobless, desperate,
and I think she's come here

17:17.202 --> 17:18.912
to steal as much as she can
from this family.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.664
She's harmless,
and she's leaving soon.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.458
Wrong, as usual.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.043
She is staying indefinitely,

17:24.084 --> 17:25.669
or at least
until she can figure out

17:25.711 --> 17:27.171
how to ruin everything
I've built.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.965
Cool. Okay, this was great.
I'm gonna go now.

17:30.924 --> 17:33.927
Well, I also think
that Alexis has recruited Amanda

17:33.969 --> 17:35.929
to destroy Blake from within.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.807
Do you know something I don't?

17:38.849 --> 17:40.601
Yes, I do.
We can't let

17:40.642 --> 17:43.103
mini-Alexis
worm her way in.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.939
I need to make Amanda
realize she has to go home.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.733
But I can't do it alone.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.819
I assume there's a plan
somewhere hidden on that board?

17:50.861 --> 17:54.823
All we have to do is prey
on her greatest fear.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.452
I don't know.
I'm kind of reformed these days.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.621
And I'm-I'm not worried
about Amanda.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.790
Oh. Well, you should be.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.375
I mean, do you really trust
our mother with a growing army?

18:05.417 --> 18:07.086
And once they're done
with Blake,

18:07.127 --> 18:09.296
who do you think
they're gonna turn on next?

18:10.923 --> 18:13.884
What if I'm not ready
to meet a new family member?

18:13.926 --> 18:16.011
Is it weird
that I brought flowers?

18:16.929 --> 18:19.056
You weren't supposed
to say yes, Sam!

18:20.390 --> 18:22.392
Yes, I know
I need to stop lurking.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.936
Fine. Bye.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.687
(door opens)

18:27.606 --> 18:28.816
Excuse me?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.653
Can I help you?

18:32.694 --> 18:35.656
Oh, my God. Hi.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.742
Yes. I'm Kirby.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.661
Oh, Kirby Anders?

18:40.702 --> 18:43.914
Wow. It's so great
to finally meet you.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.834
I wasn't expecting you today.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.502
You've been expecting me?

18:48.544 --> 18:50.796
Well, at some point, sure.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.798
Is that your natural hair color?

18:52.840 --> 18:56.093
Uh, yeah. Well, sometimes I get
highlights, but... (laughs)

18:56.135 --> 18:57.719
Okay, um,

18:57.761 --> 18:59.721
this is a really
big moment.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.099
Can I get, like,
a glass of water or something?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.350
Wait. Who do you think...?

19:03.392 --> 19:04.643
You're my sister, right?

19:04.685 --> 19:08.063
Uh, or are you my real mother?

19:08.105 --> 19:10.566
Oh, no. Is this, like,
a Chinatown situation?

19:10.607 --> 19:12.651
I'm your father's estate lawyer.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.486
I'm not related to you.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.780
In any way.
I am just Mr. Anders' attorney.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.198
Oh.
Uh,

19:18.240 --> 19:19.741
but I have something for you.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.789
I would've gotten this
to you sooner,

19:25.831 --> 19:27.916
but I've been out of town.

19:33.088 --> 19:35.132
Another hard drive? Seriously?

19:35.174 --> 19:38.302
A week before Mr. Anders died,
something compelled him

19:38.343 --> 19:40.929
to change his assets he wanted
payable upon his death.

19:40.971 --> 19:44.016
I assume
the explanation is on there.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.393
I am sorry for your loss.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.228
Your father was a great man.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.856
Certainly one
who loved mini hard drives.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.818
JENNINGS:
You're looking
extra dapper today.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.403
Is that a new scent?

19:56.445 --> 19:58.822
Vetiver and Baltic sea mist.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.700
And I always look and smell
this dapper. I'm a hotelier.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.744
Mm-hmm. It couldn't possibly
have anything to do

20:03.785 --> 20:05.412
with Beto staying at the manor?

20:05.454 --> 20:07.748
No.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.417
Well, maybe. I mean,
he's handsome and mysterious,

20:10.459 --> 20:12.169
and I'm only human, okay?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.587
And, uh,

20:13.629 --> 20:16.215
I might've seen
he was 73 feet away on...

20:16.256 --> 20:18.717
an app... I don't
really use that often.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.511
Relax. I didn't come here
to tease you about my brother.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.138
What's that?

20:23.180 --> 20:25.474
A record of correspondences
with my father.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.892
All about

20:26.934 --> 20:28.227
installing
the rigged gambling machines

20:28.268 --> 20:29.645
at the Atlantix stadium.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.855
It's what
Beto wants.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.316
Are you gonna give it to him?

20:34.358 --> 20:35.984
I wouldn't even consider it

20:36.026 --> 20:38.237
if I knew Silvio would never
have the power to hurt

20:38.278 --> 20:41.615
or manipulate me ever again.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.493
I'm also not sure
I can do that to my father.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.620
(sighs)

20:47.621 --> 20:49.790
I've been in your situation.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.833
My dad was

20:51.875 --> 20:53.502
extremely toxic.

20:53.543 --> 20:56.380
He would disappear,
miss my birthdays,

20:56.421 --> 20:58.840
reappear, get arrested.

20:58.882 --> 21:01.343
It was awful.
It sounds like it.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.471
And then, I had the chance
to turn him in, too.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.890
And I took it.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.934
And then he got killed.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.978
Truth is,

21:11.019 --> 21:13.981
I should have cut him off
way before that.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.024
The only thing
I regret was giving him

21:16.066 --> 21:18.819
so many chances that I never got
to say a real goodbye.

21:18.860 --> 21:21.029
So you think
I should turn him in?

21:21.071 --> 21:24.074
SAM:
I think whatever you choose,

21:24.116 --> 21:26.660
you should be prepared
for consequences.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.329
Can I just give you this to hold
onto while I think about it?

21:29.371 --> 21:31.832
It'll just...
make me feel better.

21:31.873 --> 21:34.209
Of course you can.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.884
Hello there, Michael.
Perfect timing.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.636
I could use a man
of your size and stature.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.680
Oh, no, we're not
doing that again.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.432
No, we're not.
It's for work.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.725
Get your mind out
of the gutter.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.226
Something wrong,
sweetheart?

21:51.268 --> 21:53.520
Yeah. I heard you're
helping Blake's campaign.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.064
You set a meeting for him
with church leaders?

21:56.106 --> 21:58.275
I did indeed.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.027
I'm full
of surprises.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.237
It's not called
"Dom-Mystique" for nothing.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.365
Yeah, well, supporting Blake
would be a "Dom mistake."
Yeah.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.200
We're supporting
Cavendish's campaign

22:07.242 --> 22:08.910
in the hopes that
he'll clear the way

22:08.952 --> 22:11.204
for launches off the Georgia
coast if I endorse him.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.540
So I need you to step away
from Blake's campaign.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.208
I don't think I can do that.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.252
Is this a plan to take down
Blake from the inside?

22:17.294 --> 22:18.920
Because that's something
I could see you doing.

22:18.962 --> 22:21.465
No, it's not.
But thank you.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.550
So you're just
letting yourself be used?

22:23.592 --> 22:26.094
I'm the one using him.

22:26.136 --> 22:31.641
If I help Blake win, I've got
the power to effect real change.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.268
How can you even say that?

22:33.310 --> 22:36.188
You know the kind of man
Blake is. We all do.

22:36.229 --> 22:39.941
Exactly. We know him...
and his secrets.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.110
Which means he'll listen

22:42.152 --> 22:43.612
when we talk.

22:43.653 --> 22:45.197
Okay, even if that were true,

22:45.238 --> 22:46.865
there's no way
Blake would ever help me.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.742
Don't be so sure.

22:48.784 --> 22:52.204
Just let me figure something out
before you endorse Cavendish.

22:52.245 --> 22:55.749
If I can't work a better offer,

22:55.791 --> 22:58.251
I'll step away from Blake.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.754
You're my priority.

23:02.297 --> 23:04.925
Fine. I'll trust you.

23:04.966 --> 23:06.510
Really digging
this jacket.

23:06.551 --> 23:07.969
Can I wear it out?

23:08.011 --> 23:10.138
Take that thing off
right now.

23:11.431 --> 23:14.309
Not the first time I've said
that to you, is it, Michael?

23:14.351 --> 23:17.479
Yeah. Okay, no.
(laughs)

23:17.521 --> 23:19.231
ANDERS:
I'll begin with some advice.

23:19.272 --> 23:22.150
Oh, great. More life lessons
from the crypt.

23:22.192 --> 23:26.321
Uh, if and when you decide
to become a parent,

23:26.363 --> 23:29.950
please don't use me
as your role model.

23:29.991 --> 23:33.703
Right now,
you're somewhere with Oliver.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.497
I don't even know
if you're safe.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.624
And once again, I've evicted you
from the manor,

23:37.666 --> 23:39.584
just like I did
when you were 12.

23:39.626 --> 23:44.131
I've no idea why I allowed this
to happen. I just did.

23:44.172 --> 23:46.758
If you're watching this, it
means that I didn't get a chance

23:46.800 --> 23:49.678
to tell you this in person,
so now you know.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.847
I'm really...

23:51.888 --> 23:55.308
well, truly sorry, Kirby.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.102
Oh.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.187
(crying):
I love you so much.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.481
God, man,
pull yourself together.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.525
(sighs)
Oh, blubbering wreck.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.278
(sniffles)
Well, you're not the only one.

24:06.319 --> 24:09.739
Before I say goodbye, there is
one more thing I need you to do.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.533
First, you need to make sure

24:11.575 --> 24:14.119
that everyone
in the manor is asleep.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.413
Now pay attention.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.998
Why didn't you tell
me you were, like,

24:18.039 --> 24:19.791
Free Solo good
at climbing?
(laughs)

24:19.833 --> 24:21.334
Uh, do you and Fallon
come here a lot?

24:21.376 --> 24:23.670
She doesn't climb anything
but the corporate ladder.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.423
No time for much
of anything but work.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.342
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.470
She's your boss.
Boundaries.

24:31.511 --> 24:35.348
I'm supposed to act like it's
news to me that she works a lot?

24:35.390 --> 24:37.100
You can tell me
what's on your mind.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.102
It'll stay here.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.272
Like, I know you were upset
about lunch yesterday.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.691
Well, that wasn't exactly
an isolated incident.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.818
I won't say I haven't noticed
the same thing.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.528
I'm waiting
for Fallon to notice.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.156
Just not sure
when that's gonna happen.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.241
I had a workaholic ex
who was the same way.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.618
Did that ever change?

24:54.659 --> 24:56.369
I did say "ex," didn't I?

24:56.411 --> 24:58.371
I can't let it get to that.

24:58.413 --> 24:59.789
I should be
the bigger person

24:59.831 --> 25:01.291
and tell her
what's bothering me.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.878
It's so nice
how quick you are to forgive.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.880
Now I get why
Fallon gives me free rein

25:06.922 --> 25:09.216
to schedule things
over your date nights.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.260
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.304
Now I'm forgetting
boundaries.
Hey,

25:14.346 --> 25:16.515
it'll stay right here.

25:16.556 --> 25:19.434
Look, there will never be
enough hours in Fallon's day.

25:19.476 --> 25:22.312
I just think you're the
first thing that she gives up

25:22.354 --> 25:26.233
because, well, I guess she can
always count on you to forgive.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.485
I'm just telling you
as a friend would.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.486
I hope you're not mad.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.530
No, not at all.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.823
It's good to know.
It's very helpful.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.285
JENNINGS:
Hi, Papa.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.454
I know
the police are after you,

25:39.496 --> 25:42.457
and I've been thinking
about helping them,

25:42.499 --> 25:47.170
so you can't ever
control me or Beto again.

25:48.838 --> 25:52.384
This may be more
than you deserve,

25:52.425 --> 25:56.179
but I could never betray you.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.807
But I won't put up with this
anymore, either.

26:00.725 --> 26:03.603
I can't have this negativity
in my life.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.817
No matter how much I love you.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.072
So this is goodbye, Papa.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.201
Forever.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.870
(knocking)

26:20.912 --> 26:22.455
Come in.

26:25.917 --> 26:26.918
It smells good in here.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.753
And strong.

26:28.795 --> 26:30.755
Incense. Blake says
I can only light it

26:30.797 --> 26:33.091
if I shut the vents in the room,
and after ten minutes,

26:33.133 --> 26:35.010
it kind of turns
into a hippie hotbox.

26:35.051 --> 26:38.263
So, I overheard you and Cristal
talking earlier.

26:38.305 --> 26:40.724
Uh-oh. Is this a confrontation?

26:40.765 --> 26:42.434
The opposite, actually.

26:42.475 --> 26:44.477
I think Cristal's really lucky
to have you.

26:44.519 --> 26:47.188
You can relate
to where she comes from.

26:47.230 --> 26:49.566
Okay, you can keep going.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.110
(laughs)
It was good advice.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.321
I think
I was asking too much of her.

26:54.362 --> 26:56.114
I'm not sure I've
really earned that.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.490
What are you gonna do?

26:57.532 --> 26:59.492
I don't know.

26:59.534 --> 27:01.286
I'm a little scared.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.288
Well, I'm-I'm sure
you could stay here.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.165
And whatever you decide,
Cristal will help.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.499
Thank you, Sam.

27:06.541 --> 27:08.627
You're a good man.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.796
So, just curious. Um...

27:11.838 --> 27:14.299
how much exactly did you hear
from that conversation?

27:14.341 --> 27:16.301
(chuckles)

27:16.343 --> 27:18.011
Oh, you mean the part
where you said

27:18.053 --> 27:21.473
I'm mysterious and handsome?

27:21.514 --> 27:23.141
And 73 feet away.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.934
Oh.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.896
How do I look
from this distance?

27:27.937 --> 27:29.731
Closer.
Oh.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.274
And even better.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.945
(sighs)
Is this a bad idea?

27:35.987 --> 27:37.197
Probably.

27:37.238 --> 27:38.657
No strings
attached, right?

27:38.698 --> 27:40.283
Nope.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.701
I don't even own a string.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.328
You know, thanks again
for inviting me tonight.

27:43.370 --> 27:44.871
(horns honking)
That was
my first football game.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.414
Well, American football.
(laughs)

27:46.456 --> 27:48.249
Mine, too. Sports
aren't my thing.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.126
I was always
picked last in P.E.
(indistinct shouting)

27:50.168 --> 27:52.629
AMANDA:
You know, um, last time
I was in America, two years ago,

27:52.671 --> 27:54.547
I was an au pair for an
oncologist in Santa Barbara,

27:54.589 --> 27:57.676
and I just didn't get
to do that many American things.
Mm.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.928
(tires screech)
Terrance, is it
happening again?

27:59.969 --> 28:01.012
(indistinct shouting)

28:01.054 --> 28:02.806
Brace yourselves for a long one.

28:02.847 --> 28:05.100
Are they protesting us?
Is this about Blake's campaign?

28:05.141 --> 28:06.893
Maybe. Though it looks
like an even blend

28:06.935 --> 28:08.687
of protestors
and paparazzi.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.897
AMANDA: Is that normal?
I'm afraid so.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.440
If it's not
Blake's campaign,

28:12.482 --> 28:14.192
they always find
a reason to surround us.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.694
Mm.
You okay?

28:15.735 --> 28:17.278
Well, um, not really.
I just...

28:17.320 --> 28:20.156
I can get...
somewhat... claustrophobic.

28:20.198 --> 28:23.451
Um, is there any way
we can get the car moving?

28:23.493 --> 28:26.329
No, no, no, no. No.
Not unless we want two dozen

28:26.371 --> 28:27.831
vehicular assault charges
on our hands.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.541
No, we're gonna ride this out.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.126
Just don't roll down the window.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.711
They usually tire out
in about an hour or so.

28:32.752 --> 28:34.379
An hour?!

28:34.421 --> 28:36.089
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be great.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.257
Listen, if you're gonna move
to Atlanta permanently,

28:37.298 --> 28:38.717
you got to get used to this.

28:38.758 --> 28:39.926
You're fresh blood
to these people.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.803
Welcome to Atlanta.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.561
Your knight
in shining armor has arrived.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.521
I'll be the judge
of how shiny you are.

28:51.563 --> 28:55.191
Tomorrow is Amanda's
Carrington coronation,

28:55.233 --> 28:58.695
and I need to know
if I should stop it, so tell me

28:58.737 --> 29:01.197
you found something
good about her firing.
I have indeed.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.533
A restraining order
was taken out against Amanda

29:03.575 --> 29:06.244
by someone
with the last name "Whitley."

29:06.286 --> 29:08.496
The parties agreed
to a protective order,

29:08.538 --> 29:10.457
but it's sealed.

29:11.416 --> 29:15.003
So clearly,
she was fired for stalking.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.380
Mm, it appears so.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.799
Here I thought you were
the scariest Carrington.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.051
Oh, I still am,
and she's about to find out.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.887
(clears throat)

29:26.473 --> 29:30.143
So, I guess
this is where you tell me

29:30.185 --> 29:32.562
the demeaning favor
I need to do for you in return?

29:32.604 --> 29:34.564
Do you really think
so little of me?

29:34.606 --> 29:36.191
Uh, don't answer that.

29:36.232 --> 29:37.400
As a matter of fact,

29:37.442 --> 29:40.028
no favor need be returned.

29:40.069 --> 29:41.613
I helped because I wanted to.

29:41.654 --> 29:43.198
What's the catch?

29:43.239 --> 29:45.533
No. I can't have this woman

29:45.575 --> 29:47.786
take my favorite
sparring partner away from me.

29:47.827 --> 29:50.580
Besides, it was nice
to play on your side for once.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.540
We should do it again.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.834
Well, after all, I am
your second largest shareholder.

29:54.876 --> 29:58.505
Yeah, you do have a point.

29:59.714 --> 30:02.675
Well, uh, I should be going.

30:02.717 --> 30:04.677
Good luck.

30:04.719 --> 30:07.263
We'll be in touch.

30:10.183 --> 30:11.893
Where the hell is he?
SAM:
Beto?

30:11.935 --> 30:14.938
He went to get some food,
after... being hungry.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.439
How long ago was that?

30:16.481 --> 30:18.024
About half an hour. Wow.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.984
He must have gotten lost.
Am I in trouble?

30:20.026 --> 30:22.320
I can't believe he'd do this.
No, no, no, no, no.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.948
It didn't mean anything for
either of us. It was just sex.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.741
What are you talking about?
Um...

30:26.783 --> 30:28.827
Oh, okay.
We can discuss that later.

30:28.868 --> 30:29.953
My cousin called.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.287
My father's been arrested.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.831
You turned him in?

30:32.872 --> 30:34.499
How? I-I have the evidence.

30:34.541 --> 30:37.460
Do you?

30:37.502 --> 30:39.838
Or did Beto take it?

30:41.548 --> 30:43.675
He must have taken it
when I was in the shower.

30:43.716 --> 30:44.884
I can't believe it.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.511
I got played by Beto?

30:46.553 --> 30:48.429
We both did.
My father's been arrested

30:48.471 --> 30:50.807
and probably thinks
I turned on him.

30:52.058 --> 30:53.810
Do you really drink this?

30:53.852 --> 30:57.438
Herbal tea will do you far more
favors than a glass of Scotch.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.275
Yeah, today was interesting.

31:00.316 --> 31:03.736
Little bit of an eye opener,
little bit of an ambush.

31:03.778 --> 31:06.030
You needed
to have your eyes opened.

31:06.072 --> 31:08.032
Maybe next time
you go to a Black church,

31:08.074 --> 31:10.201
or ask for help,
you'll be more prepared.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.245
I get it. I didn't know
what I didn't know.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.955
But you can help me, right?

31:13.997 --> 31:15.415
I'm not here to help you,

31:15.456 --> 31:17.417
or to tell you the answers.

31:17.458 --> 31:20.837
You need to try to
figure out things for yourself.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.548
Okay. So when can we expect

31:23.590 --> 31:25.466
to hear something
from Reverend Watson?

31:25.508 --> 31:27.093
Oh, I've already heard from him.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.970
He's endorsing Cavendish
instead.

31:29.012 --> 31:31.639
Seriously? Okay.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.349
What am I supposed to do now?

31:33.391 --> 31:35.226
I have some other ideas.
Don't worry.

31:37.353 --> 31:39.856
SAM:
Knock, knock.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.858
Felt like a martini night.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.111
And it looks like
you've already started.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.989
Well, I'll just, um,
leave this here.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.659
Are you okay?

31:51.701 --> 31:53.703
I'm just processing everything.
Got it.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.872
I'll leave you alone.

31:57.415 --> 32:00.335
Nope. No, I can't.
I feel terrible.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.544
It's not your fault, Sam.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.670
I don't want to be responsible

32:02.712 --> 32:03.880
for your father hating you.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.007
You're not.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.635
He doesn't.

32:08.676 --> 32:10.470
What are you talking about?

32:14.057 --> 32:16.184
I just heard
from Silvio's lawyer.

32:17.101 --> 32:20.605
The voice mail I left must have
had an impact on my father

32:20.647 --> 32:23.816
because he legally left me
the family business

32:23.858 --> 32:25.818
to run while he's in jail.

32:26.819 --> 32:29.030
So, you're in charge
of the Flores Empire now?

32:30.907 --> 32:32.909
Well, maybe
you should be thanking me.

32:34.744 --> 32:37.997
Sorry. Too soon.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.210
I am so sorry you had
to go through that.

32:42.251 --> 32:45.588
Um, it's just part
of Carrington life.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.882
Oh, lovely.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.843
Um, you know, I could use a tea
to settle my nerves a bit.

32:50.885 --> 32:54.013
There's the little stalker.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.807
It's over, Amanda.
You're out of here.

32:55.848 --> 32:57.850
You can stand down, Adam.

32:57.892 --> 32:59.268
I've got
everything I need.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.603
Stand down?

33:00.645 --> 33:02.730
Do you want to talk
about Judge Whitley?

33:06.901 --> 33:08.861
Please, Fallon.
I'd rather not.

33:08.903 --> 33:10.863
Or I could tell Blake.

33:10.905 --> 33:13.658
I mean, he should know before
he introduces you to the world.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.785
Or he should at least know
that a judge filed

33:15.827 --> 33:17.870
a restraining order
against you that got you fired.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.041
Judge Whitley and I were
in a romantic relationship.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.002
And I'm guessing
he was married?
Mm.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.753
She was, yes.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.588
We met when I
was an intern

33:27.630 --> 33:29.173
two summers ago.
When I started

33:29.215 --> 33:30.675
at Buckley Chance,
she ruled on several

33:30.717 --> 33:32.260
high-profile cases
that I was on.

33:32.301 --> 33:34.512
So, when the affair threatened
to leak,

33:34.554 --> 33:36.597
the conflict of interest
could have been a disaster.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.641
And that's when you decided

33:38.683 --> 33:40.643
to put her pet bunny
in boiling water?

33:41.602 --> 33:44.814
Judge Whitley-- Florence--

33:44.856 --> 33:47.734
she called off the affair
and said I was a stalker

33:47.775 --> 33:50.570
to protect the cases that we had
worked on and her career.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.572
So everything
was kept confidential,

33:52.613 --> 33:55.992
and I had to leave my job.
It's the end.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.535
Well, don't you think

33:57.577 --> 33:59.120
that's something
you should have mentioned?

33:59.162 --> 34:01.914
Oh, tell the most painful
experience of my life

34:01.956 --> 34:03.583
to the family I just met?

34:03.624 --> 34:05.626
Sure, yeah, I could have.

34:05.668 --> 34:08.004
Right after you tell me
what's going on with Liam.

34:09.964 --> 34:12.258
You know, I feel sorry
for you, Fallon.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.260
When my life unraveled,
I dealt with it head-on

34:14.302 --> 34:15.970
before I lost everything.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.972
You're pretending
like the problem doesn't exist.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.058
So good luck with that.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.560
And I don't even know
what to say about you, weirdo.

34:22.602 --> 34:24.896
I think that pretty
much says it all.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.524
You know, um,
I had everything under control.

34:28.566 --> 34:30.068
She was gonna
move back to London.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.652
Everything was all good,

34:31.694 --> 34:33.654
and then you came in
and messed everything up.

34:33.696 --> 34:35.782
You have no idea.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.455
ANDERS: Now that
you've procured the box,

34:42.497 --> 34:43.956
these two items should

34:43.998 --> 34:45.708
provide you with stability.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.377
The-the first
in the envelope is a statement

34:48.419 --> 34:51.547
transferring my life savings
to you.

34:51.589 --> 34:55.593
As you know, my, uh,
expenditures in life were small,

34:55.635 --> 34:57.553
so it's quite a sizable sum.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.597
Not Carrington wealth, but

34:59.639 --> 35:02.225
enough to keep you comfortable.

35:02.266 --> 35:05.937
The other is a manuscript of
sorts, except it's not fiction.

35:05.978 --> 35:08.648
It is, in fact,
the Carrington family secrets

35:08.689 --> 35:10.483
that I swore
to take to my grave.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.236
But I'm handing them on to you.

35:15.071 --> 35:17.240
Insurance and protection

35:17.281 --> 35:19.909
with which you may do
whatever you choose.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.287
But I hope that
these two bequests will help you

35:23.329 --> 35:26.040
accomplish whatever it is
you want from life.

35:26.082 --> 35:28.000
Good luck, Kirby.

35:28.042 --> 35:30.002
I love you.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.131
Holy...

35:34.090 --> 35:37.009
I know there's something
happening between us.

35:37.051 --> 35:39.971
And I can admit

35:40.012 --> 35:42.723
that I have been less
than present lately.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.643
That's a start.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.645
But it's not related to you.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.772
Okay, if I could be
in two places at once,

35:49.814 --> 35:51.774
we'd have no problems.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.026
We just need another Fallon.

35:54.068 --> 35:56.279
I'm not sure
the world's ready for that.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.447
No, probably not.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.993
But I am sorry,

36:02.034 --> 36:04.162
and I hope you can forgive me.

36:06.372 --> 36:08.332
That's it?

36:08.374 --> 36:10.501
What's it?

36:12.336 --> 36:15.298
I am so tired of
having to forgive you

36:15.339 --> 36:17.758
without any change or
growth on your part.

36:17.800 --> 36:21.220
You just keep repeating
the same pattern.

36:23.181 --> 36:27.393
Yes, I'm sorry
I skipped lunch yesterday,

36:27.435 --> 36:29.395
but Amanda seemed
like a threat.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.397
She seemed?

36:31.439 --> 36:34.233
I told you, Liam,
I am the head of this family,

36:34.275 --> 36:37.570
and it is my responsibility
to look into these things.

36:37.612 --> 36:40.072
Today it was Amanda.

36:40.114 --> 36:43.075
But before that,
it was a hostile takeover.

36:43.117 --> 36:44.994
And then it was Dom
and your shopping network.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.288
There is always
something that is

36:47.330 --> 36:49.290
more urgent than me.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.709
And when it's not, you choose
to make it more urgent than me.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.294
It is humiliating.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.837
Whoa. Hold on.
Where is this coming from?

36:54.879 --> 36:56.255
Why are you so angry?

36:56.297 --> 36:58.049
It's been here, Fallon.

36:59.300 --> 37:03.137
I guess this is just the first
time you're actually noticing.

37:04.096 --> 37:05.640
Okay.

37:07.391 --> 37:10.144
Well, since we're sharing,

37:10.186 --> 37:12.772
ever since
you and I got married,

37:12.813 --> 37:14.732
I feel

37:14.774 --> 37:18.694
like you have wanted me
to choose between work and you.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.112
Oh, my God.
And I just didn't realize

37:20.154 --> 37:21.656
that you had such
an antiquated view

37:21.697 --> 37:23.574
on a woman's role.

37:23.616 --> 37:24.742
Is that what you think this is?

37:24.784 --> 37:26.786
Our life will return to normal.

37:26.827 --> 37:28.537
It will.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.289
It's just
that I have had a lot going on

37:30.331 --> 37:32.541
with the business,
with my family.

37:32.583 --> 37:35.211
So I'm sorry if I haven't
always been there, okay?

37:35.253 --> 37:37.004
I had to do
what I had to do.

37:37.046 --> 37:40.258
I don't need to hear excuses
about the past, Fallon.

37:40.299 --> 37:44.262
Show me how things will be
different in the future.

37:44.303 --> 37:47.139
I will,

37:47.181 --> 37:52.311
but right now, I am just
asking you to be patient.

37:52.353 --> 37:54.313
Okay.

37:54.355 --> 37:57.191
But I think I'll go be patient
in the guest room tonight.

38:04.156 --> 38:07.034
When are these people you claim
are gonna help me getting here?

38:07.076 --> 38:09.287
Right about now.

38:09.328 --> 38:12.581
Oh. Yeah, Dominique,

38:12.623 --> 38:14.917
if you're talking
about these two yahoos...

38:14.959 --> 38:17.044
Gentlemen,
I was just leaving.

38:17.086 --> 38:19.171
Perfect.
We can skip the awkwardness.

38:19.213 --> 38:21.215
Enough.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.591
Sit down.

38:26.595 --> 38:28.639
I didn't approve of this.
It's a bad idea.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.683
Oh, finally, we
agree on something.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.518
I'm calling
Cavendish's office.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.438
You are not. Blake,

38:35.479 --> 38:38.524
Jeff and Michael are prominent
in the Black community,

38:38.566 --> 38:41.694
and you need some help to make
up for what you've already lost.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.154
JEFF:
Right. And...

38:43.195 --> 38:44.739
and we're helping him, why?

38:44.780 --> 38:46.532
We've already
been over this.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.367
I've even had
terms drawn up.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.578
Blake,

38:50.619 --> 38:53.289
you will get public appearances
from Jeff and Michael.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.915
In return,

38:54.957 --> 38:57.001
they will get what they want

38:57.043 --> 38:58.502
in the form
of promises

38:58.544 --> 39:01.589
to be fulfilled
upon your election.

39:01.630 --> 39:02.715
I'm behind in the polls.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.175
What happens to these promises

39:04.216 --> 39:06.260
if I don't win?

39:07.261 --> 39:10.264
I have no doubt you'll make sure
that doesn't happen.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.265
I can live with this.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.892
I don't like it.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.477
They're getting the better end
of the deal here.

39:14.518 --> 39:17.521
That's because you
can't win without them.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.776
Can I have the room for a minute
to speak with my sister?

39:21.817 --> 39:23.736
Okay.
Not a problem.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.822
(clears throat)

39:26.864 --> 39:28.866
Assuming the worst
in new additions

39:28.908 --> 39:31.827
is kind of
a Carrington family tradition.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.329
Is that an apology?

39:33.371 --> 39:35.414
Because it's just not
a very good one.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.041
Well, they're not really
my specialty.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.543
Another Carrington trait.
Just ask my husband.

39:39.585 --> 39:42.922
So you're admitting that
things aren't perfect then?

39:42.963 --> 39:44.799
Far from it.
Wow.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.133
You're human after all.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.968
Let's not get carried away.

39:48.010 --> 39:51.013
But I was thinking
we could start over

39:51.055 --> 39:52.181
and try this whole

39:52.223 --> 39:54.141
sister thing for real?

39:54.183 --> 39:57.019
I'm open to that. Somewhat.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.521
Cool.

39:59.855 --> 40:01.440
Okay.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.402
I'll go find Blake.

40:04.443 --> 40:06.862
Otherwise, this will
only get more weird.
Okay.

40:07.822 --> 40:10.032
Oh. Have you come
to apologize

40:10.074 --> 40:11.158
to me, too?

40:11.200 --> 40:12.910
For what?

40:12.952 --> 40:15.454
I've done nothing wrong,
and I don't trust you.

40:15.496 --> 40:17.289
(sighs)
You know, Alexis was right.

40:17.331 --> 40:18.624
You really do bring the drama.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.876
I do? You're the one who claimed

40:20.918 --> 40:22.878
to be an au pair
for an oncologist

40:22.920 --> 40:25.798
the same summer as you were
an intern that fell in love.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.800
I mean, if you're gonna lie,
just do a better job of it.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.343
Fine.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.220
I said one white lie
to try and impress you.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.680
You know, from what I've heard,

40:32.721 --> 40:34.181
your lies aren't quite
as harmless.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.267
So I'm not really worried
about your judgment.

40:36.308 --> 40:38.686
Do you think you can supplant me
in this family?

40:38.727 --> 40:40.563
It's never gonna happen.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.815
Eventually, everyone will see
who you really are.

40:42.857 --> 40:45.985
Exactly. Your sister,
who's about to go

40:46.026 --> 40:48.446
on live national television
with our father.

40:48.487 --> 40:50.281
I'm curious.

40:50.322 --> 40:53.033
Did he proudly announce you
to the world like this?

40:53.075 --> 40:54.952
Oh.

40:55.911 --> 40:57.872
I didn't think so.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.835
BETO: Cristal?!
(knocking)
Excuse me.

41:02.877 --> 41:05.171
Cristal? Where the hell
is my sister?

41:05.212 --> 41:07.465
Hey, quiet down.
Blake's doing an interview.

41:07.506 --> 41:08.966
What are you doing here?

41:09.008 --> 41:10.301
Did Dad really
leave you the company?

41:10.342 --> 41:12.470
Yes, but...
I knew it.

41:12.511 --> 41:14.096
You always figure out a way
to keep everything.

41:14.138 --> 41:17.057
So this was never
about making us safe, was it?

41:17.099 --> 41:18.642
You were just
using me

41:18.684 --> 41:20.019
to put Dad in jail
so that you could

41:20.060 --> 41:21.437
get the reins of the business.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.105
Don't make me out
to be the bad guy here.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.982
You made yourself
the bad guy.

41:25.024 --> 41:27.359
Our father is in jail
because of you.

41:27.401 --> 41:28.777
What the hell's going on
out here?

41:28.819 --> 41:30.112
Do I need to call security?

41:30.154 --> 41:32.448
Stay out of this, Blake.
You're not needed.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.867
This is my house.
I'll decide where I'm needed.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.786
You betrayed my trust, Beto.

41:39.413 --> 41:42.291
I want you to leave. Now!

41:42.333 --> 41:45.836
You've chosen loyalty
to the wrong family, Cristal.

41:45.878 --> 41:47.505
Don't worry.

41:47.546 --> 41:51.175
I'm gonna leave, but this--
this isn't over.

41:51.217 --> 41:54.303
I'm gonna come back,
and I will get what's mine.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.846
(door opens)

41:55.888 --> 41:57.515
(door closes)
