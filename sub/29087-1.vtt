00:41.130 --> 00:43.338
<i>for today and the next three days.</i>

00:43.422 --> 00:46.088
<i>-With clear skies in...</i>
<i>-Creative and entrepreneurial?</i>

<i>Come and see the space</i>

00:55.588 --> 00:59.172
<i>"She left early", yes, it's correct Lola,</i>

00:59.255 --> 01:02.380
<i>"she left early".</i>
"Ella se marchó temprano".

01:08.338 --> 01:09.338
<i>That's right,</i>

01:09.922 --> 01:12.297
<i>it almost killed me, you know?</i>

01:12.672 --> 01:16.213
<i>But I took the flowers to her</i>
<i>right up there on the mountain.</i>

01:16.380 --> 01:18.297
<i>Love, that is love.</i>

01:18.463 --> 01:22.755
<i>Finally, why have you chosen</i>
<i>the Spanish version of this song?</i>

01:23.255 --> 01:25.755
<i>Well, everyone knows the original.</i>

01:26.380 --> 01:29.130
<i>But, you know,</i>

01:29.713 --> 01:31.755
<i>it'll never be the same as saying</i>

01:32.380 --> 01:33.213
<i>"I love you"</i>

01:33.963 --> 01:36.172
<i>in the language that's in your heart.</i>

02:06.630 --> 02:07.338
Mati!

02:07.838 --> 02:10.297
Mati, come on, get off! Get off!

02:41.713 --> 02:42.422
Yes?

02:44.172 --> 02:44.922
Hello?

02:56.255 --> 02:57.130
Anna?

02:57.880 --> 02:58.880
Are you there?

03:23.672 --> 03:24.422
Aunty...

03:37.547 --> 03:40.297
Aunty, have you seen
a red folder I left here?

03:44.088 --> 03:45.713
Did you buy my lemons?

03:46.672 --> 03:48.255
Anna always buys them for me.

03:48.380 --> 03:49.463
You're kidding me.

04:20.338 --> 04:21.547
When is Anna coming?

04:27.380 --> 04:28.422
Aunty, don't go.

05:25.380 --> 05:26.797
For fuck's sake, mate.

05:51.672 --> 05:52.588
Fuck!

06:11.338 --> 06:12.088
Excuse me.

06:51.713 --> 06:53.547
-Hello?
<i>-Yes, can I help?</i>

06:53.630 --> 06:55.297
Yes, the receipt won't come out.

06:55.422 --> 06:58.213
<i>-It always gets swallowed.</i>
-I need it.

06:58.422 --> 07:00.505
<i>Give it a good hit.</i>

07:00.672 --> 07:03.672
-The machine?
<i>-Of course, who else?</i>

07:59.130 --> 08:00.380
I'll get in here.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.672
This idiot parked like a moron.

09:49.797 --> 09:51.797
<i>-So, everything's OK?</i>
-Yes.

09:52.672 --> 09:55.047
They were ten minutes late, but it's OK.

09:55.463 --> 09:56.963
I had time for a coffee.

09:57.172 --> 10:02.255
<i>Remember to keep the receipts.</i>
<i>If not, you have to pay for it all.</i>

10:02.505 --> 10:03.672
I've kept them all.

10:04.130 --> 10:05.713
<i>Don't overdo it.</i>

10:05.880 --> 10:07.713
<i>Be careful with the car.</i>
<i>You hear me?</i>

10:08.047 --> 10:12.505
<i>There's trouble at the moment.</i>
<i>Some tyres have already been slashed.</i>

10:13.797 --> 10:14.588
Don't worry.

10:15.505 --> 10:17.463
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>did you cut your hair?</i>

10:18.880 --> 10:19.672
Yes.

10:20.338 --> 10:23.630
<i>You're not driving</i>
<i>the yellow submarine.</i>

10:24.255 --> 10:25.297
Yes, boss.

10:25.630 --> 10:27.338
<i>Inform me of everything you do.</i>

10:27.797 --> 10:30.422
<i>That's as important as being on time.</i>

10:30.505 --> 10:32.380
<i>And wash the car daily.</i>

10:32.797 --> 10:34.172
<i>-OK?</i>
-Yes.

10:35.213 --> 10:38.338
<i>And be discreet,</i>
<i>you're a clever boy.</i>

11:31.338 --> 11:33.005
So much for first class.

11:42.755 --> 11:43.922

13:27.963 --> 13:29.005

13:30.672 --> 13:32.713
-It's my first day.
-Rotten luck!

13:33.422 --> 13:34.088
Well...

13:34.672 --> 13:37.047
Sometimes it's good
to begin at the bottom.

13:38.213 --> 13:40.047
I'll see you around.

13:41.047 --> 13:42.463
Your breakfast, Juan.

13:43.880 --> 13:44.880
Good morning.

13:45.088 --> 13:45.963
Hello.

13:46.172 --> 13:47.588
Will you be long?

13:48.172 --> 13:49.838
I'm not sure. They didn't say.

13:49.922 --> 13:51.422
Move on then, please.

13:52.088 --> 13:53.463
But they're staying here.

13:53.963 --> 13:56.338
Easy, Stevie. They'll call you.

13:56.588 --> 13:59.213
They always do, believe me.
Go sit in the sun, or...

13:59.297 --> 14:01.922
have a beer, go to a bar, OK?

14:02.172 --> 14:03.213
Thank you.

14:04.797 --> 14:05.880
Fuck.

14:11.588 --> 14:14.838
<i>The brightness of the heavens</i>

14:15.547 --> 14:17.880

14:19.005 --> 14:22.338

14:23.130 --> 14:24.963
<i>Will never change</i>

14:26.422 --> 14:29.588
<i>I want nothing from the world</i>

<i>If I ever lose you</i>

14:38.630 --> 14:40.588
<i>I will die</i>

14:41.005 --> 14:43.755
<i>That's why it's you</i>

-Claudia. Have you seen Anna?
-What are you doing?

15:12.005 --> 15:13.838
-Get off.
-I need to talk to her.

15:13.922 --> 15:15.963
-No.
-She won't answer my calls.

15:16.005 --> 15:17.130
You're a shit, Boi.

15:17.213 --> 15:18.880
Leave her alone, calm down.

15:19.088 --> 15:21.755
Don't get worked up, young man.
Let her go.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.838
Don't get worked up, young man.
It's all over now.

15:25.297 --> 15:27.963
Now you know what to do:
don't get worked up.

16:18.213 --> 16:20.130
You look much older...

19:14.130 --> 19:15.088

<i>What's new, Mr Bean?</i>

19:45.088 --> 19:46.838
<i>How's it going? How are things?</i>

<i>Like all of us, little man.</i>
<i>You have to study.</i>

19:51.630 --> 19:54.213
<i>Are you happy with the job I got for you?</i>

19:54.297 --> 19:55.130
Yes.

19:55.838 --> 19:57.630

19:57.713 --> 20:00.005
<i>Are you coming to my gig</i>

20:00.088 --> 20:01.963
<i>I've saved you seats in the stalls.</i>

<i>-Now?</i>
-Yes.

20:07.213 --> 20:10.838
<i>No way, man.</i>
<i>I'm going to pick up some clients.</i>

20:15.963 --> 20:18.380
-We'll talk when I see you.
<i>-Fuck...</i>

20:18.463 --> 20:20.422
Let me know
when you have time.

20:20.713 --> 20:23.088
I'll be at the congress

<i>Cool, mate.</i>
<i>Whatever you want.</i>

20:25.547 --> 20:28.755
<i>I'll call you when I'm free,</i>
<i>we can get a coffee.</i>

Do you know any?

20:35.672 --> 20:38.505
<i>Of course, mate.</i>
<i>I know a wicked one for tonight.</i>

20:47.088 --> 20:48.672
-For three people.
<i>-Great.</i>

what type of food do you have?

20:54.088 --> 20:56.255
<i>-Do you know where this is?</i>
-Yes.

20:57.047 --> 21:01.338
<i>Good. We have a closed tasting menu</i>
<i>made up of 24 different dishes.</i>

21:01.422 --> 21:02.130
Perfect.

21:02.672 --> 21:06.422
<i>We have a table for three</i>
<i>available in January.</i>

-What? January?
<i>-That's right.</i>

21:08.755 --> 21:11.255
-January next year?
<i>-Yes.</i>

21:12.630 --> 21:15.547
OK, thank you.
I'll call back later and...

21:15.630 --> 21:17.922
I'll see what my clients think. Thank you.

<i>-What can I do for you?</i>
-A table for three, tonight at 8 p.m.

<i>The kitchen opens at 8:30 p.m.</i>

Perfect.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.505
-What type of food is it?
<i>-Excuse me?</i>

21:40.713 --> 21:42.130
I said, what type of...?

21:42.547 --> 21:45.213
<i>-This is an Italian restaurant.</i>
-One second, please.

21:45.297 --> 21:46.672
<i>-Yes, I'll wait.</i>
-Don't hang up.

21:46.922 --> 21:48.255
<i>I haven't got all day.</i>

21:48.338 --> 21:50.463
-Is that car comfortable?
-Sorry?

<i>"In your novel,</i> Reasonable Blood,

<i>But your intention</i>
<i>is not always clear,</i>

23:20.505 --> 23:23.297
<i>it's as though the meeting</i>
<i>of all of your characters</i>

<i>represents the nature of solitude</i>

23:49.213 --> 23:52.172
Look, Isabel.
The ad we told you about.

23:52.255 --> 23:54.047

24:31.922 --> 24:35.047
Isabel, you need Caffè Ampolloso.

24:35.213 --> 24:38.463
Don't start, Àngel.
Don't you boys have homes to go to?

24:38.547 --> 24:40.213
Between us,
your coffee is rubbish.

24:40.338 --> 24:41.422
-Really?
-Yes.

24:41.630 --> 24:45.713
People will come if you serve Ampolloso,
it'll reset the bar.

24:45.922 --> 24:50.380
Leave that modern stuff out of it.
We've always served Café Carrizosa here.

24:50.463 --> 24:52.380
My parents, my grandparents, and me.

24:52.463 --> 24:55.088
When it closes,
it'll be serving Café Carrizosa.

24:55.172 --> 24:58.547
-Look Isabel, here's a dare.
-No, enough of your shows.

24:58.630 --> 25:02.297
Take him away, David.
It's always the same with you:

25:02.380 --> 25:04.672
you come for a snack,
and we're here all night

25:04.755 --> 25:07.213
-with an ambulance...
-It's the last dare.

25:07.422 --> 25:10.588
If coffee comes out of my nose,
you'll serve Ampolloso.

25:12.005 --> 25:14.380
First of all, that's not coffee.
Thanks, kid.

25:14.588 --> 25:17.588
-Tell her.
-We must resist, we're revolutionaries.

25:18.130 --> 25:18.838

25:22.172 --> 25:23.963

25:24.005 --> 25:26.838
Flies? Pests, more like!
Go on, out.

25:26.922 --> 25:29.838
Home with you. Go, go!

25:29.963 --> 25:32.005
-It's just a handstand.
-No handstand!

25:32.088 --> 25:34.380

28:50.880 --> 28:51.713
Are you OK?

28:51.880 --> 28:53.338
Yes, thank you.

29:04.547 --> 29:06.297
Yes, look.

29:06.380 --> 29:09.255
-Turn around at Via Laietana.
-OK.

29:09.713 --> 29:11.297
Look for the Ronda Litoral.

29:11.630 --> 29:14.130
-It will be signposted from there.
-OK.

29:14.588 --> 29:15.380
Thank you.

32:13.047 --> 32:15.755
Great, Aunty.
I'm pleased to hear it.

32:16.547 --> 32:18.047
<i>Did you buy me lemons?</i>

32:18.505 --> 32:20.088
Yes, I have your lemons.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.380
I bought them.

32:21.463 --> 32:23.755
I'll give them to you when I get home.

32:24.005 --> 32:25.547
<i>-Don't be long.</i>
-OK.

32:28.797 --> 32:31.005
I have to go, Aunty.
I'm almost home.

32:31.213 --> 32:33.338
See you in a minute, I love you.

32:33.547 --> 32:34.797
END CALL

33:39.547 --> 33:40.963
This is ridiculous.

33:50.505 --> 33:51.922
Fuck, it's cold.

33:55.547 --> 33:56.422
Aunty...

34:23.963 --> 34:25.172
Good morning, Aunty.

35:12.755 --> 35:14.213
The city awakens.

35:16.255 --> 35:18.047
The bleary eyes are long gone.

35:20.130 --> 35:23.630
Dogs stroll around
like dreams... ownerless.

35:25.922 --> 35:29.047
Cars with empty
and absurd lives inside them.

35:31.588 --> 35:34.255
Prostitutes and weapons
which don't commit their crimes.

35:38.797 --> 35:41.213
And here, by my side,

35:42.297 --> 35:44.297
a teenager clowning around.

35:50.130 --> 35:51.297
Ampolloso.

36:22.838 --> 36:23.713
He's staying.

36:24.713 --> 36:27.088
Unbelievable, everyone ignores me.

36:30.630 --> 36:32.255
What a guy...

36:41.047 --> 36:43.338
People don't have a sense of humour.

36:43.422 --> 36:45.380
Who laughed at you back there?

36:45.463 --> 36:47.880
Who roared with laughter?
Nobody. Just me.

36:49.047 --> 36:51.963
Careful with your guys, eh?

36:52.797 --> 36:55.755
I mean, don't expect anything in return

36:55.838 --> 36:59.047
and don't take anything for yourself,
you know?

36:59.297 --> 37:03.005
So if they leave some coins on the seat,
a packet of cigarettes,

37:03.422 --> 37:06.630
a roll-on deodorant... You keep it.

37:06.922 --> 37:09.630
They'll ask for it,
just you believe me.

37:12.088 --> 37:13.297
606.

37:14.172 --> 37:14.963
This is it.

37:25.588 --> 37:27.922
Boi? That's your name?

39:38.213 --> 39:38.963
Hey, Mou.

39:39.755 --> 39:41.547
Hey. What's up?

39:41.630 --> 39:43.255
Just let me finish this.

40:03.172 --> 40:04.797
How are you?
What happened?

40:20.547 --> 40:21.755
<i>Anna is pregnant.</i>

40:24.130 --> 40:25.338
<i>Almost three months.</i>

40:28.380 --> 40:30.963
<i>It wasn't planned</i>
<i>but we decided to keep it.</i>

40:34.172 --> 40:37.922
<i>Last week the last editorial</i>
<i>wrote to me.</i>

40:44.422 --> 40:45.838
<i>I read it and lost heart.</i>

40:47.380 --> 40:49.255
<i>I disappeared for two days.</i>

40:52.130 --> 40:55.088
<i>I missed the 12-week visit</i>
<i>to the gynaecologist and...</i>

40:57.255 --> 41:00.463
<i>when I got home I told Anna</i>
<i>I wasn't ready to be a father,</i>

41:03.088 --> 41:04.922
<i>that abortion was the best option.</i>

41:07.130 --> 41:09.505
<i>She left.</i>
<i>I haven't heard from her since.</i>

41:11.922 --> 41:13.047
I write, I call...

41:14.172 --> 41:14.963
Nothing.

41:18.338 --> 41:20.922
Now I'm worried
she'll make up her own mind.

41:25.005 --> 41:26.505
Something's up, Mou.

41:29.463 --> 41:32.463
I went to live with my aunt
to help and write the novel...

41:34.963 --> 41:36.797
I got both things wrong.

41:40.588 --> 41:41.672
And now, Anna.

41:44.005 --> 41:45.963
She's the most important thing to me...

41:48.797 --> 41:49.922
and I've failed her.

41:57.547 --> 42:00.297
Look, that's how you feel right now:

42:01.713 --> 42:03.588
like it all revolves around you.

42:04.297 --> 42:05.630
It won't make you strong.

42:05.963 --> 42:07.297
What will, is trust.

42:07.797 --> 42:09.088
Trust Anna, as always.

42:09.963 --> 42:12.672
I need to calm down
and think it all over.

42:12.797 --> 42:16.422
Don't think.
The best things in life are unplanned.

42:17.713 --> 42:20.463
I like to call it: "universal touché".

42:20.922 --> 42:23.172
I don't want to bring
a kid into the world

42:23.588 --> 42:25.755
and mess up its life
as a frustrated father.

42:26.005 --> 42:28.422
This letter is telling you

42:28.630 --> 42:30.547
to bring a kid
into this awful world.

42:31.380 --> 42:32.172
I'll read it:

42:32.755 --> 42:35.963
"I have a hunch that this could become
an excellent work.

42:36.255 --> 42:38.713
But it needs time,
maturity, silence, obsession.

42:38.838 --> 42:43.130
You need to challenge yourself and write
when you can't or don't want to."

42:43.338 --> 42:46.588
That is,
between nappies, crying and swerving.

42:49.588 --> 42:51.255
We should be celebrating this.

42:57.047 --> 42:59.213
-Thanks, Mou.
-Don't thank me.

42:59.297 --> 43:00.713
I'm just your inner voice,

43:01.505 --> 43:03.755
the one telling you
to open that glove box.

43:14.255 --> 43:15.130
So?

43:16.172 --> 43:17.505
"A Latin dream".

43:18.213 --> 43:21.588
I changed the verses we were looking at
the other day.

43:22.130 --> 43:23.172
I think I have it.

43:24.172 --> 43:25.297
"With my heart"...

43:26.130 --> 43:27.505
it'll be a real hit.

43:28.547 --> 43:31.255
Come on,
let me introduce you to humanity.

43:45.463 --> 43:46.838
There's a wig lurking.

43:47.630 --> 43:48.588
Can you find it?

43:51.880 --> 43:52.922
Brothers!

43:53.547 --> 43:55.047
This is my mate, Boi.

43:55.838 --> 43:56.838
Be nice, OK?

43:56.922 --> 43:57.672
Hello.

43:57.922 --> 44:00.547
-Hold the smoke in, it gets you higher.
-He's right.

44:01.588 --> 44:02.838
But don't overdo it.

44:04.547 --> 44:06.755
I have to make a call,
back in a minute.

44:10.713 --> 44:11.963
-Kilometre?
-What?

44:12.172 --> 44:14.588
Does water with fluoride
make you infertile?

44:14.713 --> 44:16.547
You don't say! Of course.

44:18.380 --> 44:21.005
Listen, as I was saying before...

44:21.172 --> 44:23.630
life can be blown out
just like a match.

44:24.088 --> 44:26.880
This guy, less than 20 years old...

44:30.713 --> 44:34.047
I wear this suit
for everything, you know?

44:34.338 --> 44:37.797
For work,
to go to my niece's communion,

44:38.130 --> 44:41.255
to go to a charity event...

44:41.338 --> 44:43.338
-Hey. What's your name?
-Boi.

44:44.630 --> 44:45.922
I'm being watched.

44:46.213 --> 44:47.172
A pleasure.

44:47.838 --> 44:49.880
I don't know
what I've got myself into.

44:50.630 --> 44:52.463
This is why, look.

44:54.172 --> 44:55.463
-That's weird.
-Yes.

44:56.130 --> 44:57.088
It's from a novel.

44:57.338 --> 44:58.963
The worst was this morning.

44:59.213 --> 45:02.630
This is my steering wheel
at 06:33 a.m.

45:04.672 --> 45:06.422
and at 07:46 a.m.

45:09.505 --> 45:10.588
What was your name?

45:14.130 --> 45:16.505
I fly in and out.

45:24.172 --> 45:25.338
Thank you.

45:26.380 --> 45:27.172
Thank you.

45:30.880 --> 45:31.797
Thank you!

45:32.630 --> 45:34.297
<i>Ciao,</i> thank you.

45:41.213 --> 45:42.130
I'm afraid that

45:42.880 --> 45:45.630
we only find truth
when we don't know we're being watched.

45:47.755 --> 45:49.963
That's where the fantastic is created.

45:51.963 --> 45:54.672
But, to be able to see that place

45:55.338 --> 45:57.922
you need an anonymous presence.

45:59.380 --> 46:02.338
To be born with the gift
of going unnoticed.

46:03.797 --> 46:05.755
Like Matilda, my dog.

46:06.880 --> 46:07.880
She's rude

46:08.380 --> 46:09.505
and she's smart.

46:11.880 --> 46:13.547
An eternal<i> flâneur.</i>

46:17.755 --> 46:20.255
I wish I could say
she's my self-portrait, but...

46:20.963 --> 46:21.963
I don't think so.

46:26.755 --> 46:27.630
Water.

46:28.838 --> 46:29.963
It's foul.

46:34.588 --> 46:36.005
In this car

46:36.880 --> 46:39.047
it's difficult to go unnoticed.

46:40.630 --> 46:41.505
Although...

46:42.213 --> 46:45.213
it's given me
the power to be an exhibitionist.

46:46.088 --> 46:47.422
And don't be mistaken...

46:48.588 --> 46:49.505
What's that?

46:51.463 --> 46:53.380
If Boi comes from<i> voyeur?</i>

46:54.838 --> 46:56.213
Maybe it's just fate...

46:57.630 --> 46:58.505
I don't know.

47:01.713 --> 47:03.797
But I do know
I'm talking to myself

47:05.922 --> 47:07.505
and it's a good time to whistle.

47:08.505 --> 47:10.630
I know how to whistle. Look:

47:22.463 --> 47:25.338
Anna, please let that be you. Please.

47:26.255 --> 47:28.255
Please, Anna. Please...

47:28.963 --> 47:29.880
Shit!

47:33.047 --> 47:34.297
What the hell?

47:35.422 --> 47:36.297
Fucking hell.

47:40.922 --> 47:42.130
<i>Hello, Boi!</i>

48:17.297 --> 48:18.130
What?

48:42.963 --> 48:43.797
<i>Nice!</i>

52:25.047 --> 52:25.922
Quickly!

52:31.338 --> 52:32.088
Come on!

52:35.213 --> 52:36.172
Come on, Mati!

52:40.797 --> 52:41.713
Quickly!

52:44.463 --> 52:45.297
Come on!

52:55.005 --> 52:56.422
Hurry up, we're late.

52:57.797 --> 52:58.880
The keys...

53:05.963 --> 53:07.088
Come on, Aunty.

53:12.963 --> 53:13.838
Shit.

53:15.922 --> 53:16.922
Fuck.

53:22.630 --> 53:23.963
What do we do now?

53:59.047 --> 54:00.130
Don't worry, Mati.

54:00.213 --> 54:01.422
We'll be home soon.

54:15.047 --> 54:16.213
Damn it!

54:23.838 --> 54:24.755
Hello, Boi.

58:10.547 --> 58:11.505
Shit.

58:18.755 --> 58:20.130
Fucking hell.

58:32.880 --> 58:34.047
Fucking hell.

58:38.172 --> 58:38.963
BOSS CALLING

58:39.047 --> 58:40.213
Just what I need.

59:47.672 --> 59:49.047
There, Matilda.

1:01:32.338 --> 1:01:33.463
Hello?

1:01:34.630 --> 1:01:36.047
<i>Boi, where are you?</i>

1:01:36.213 --> 1:01:38.713
I'm going to the hotel
to drop my clients off.

1:01:40.213 --> 1:01:41.963
<i>Why didn't you answer?</i>

1:01:44.130 --> 1:01:45.588
Sorry, boss, but...

1:01:46.005 --> 1:01:49.297
my clients had a mishap in the restaurant
and asked for help.

1:01:51.047 --> 1:01:52.672
<i>So you hang up?</i>

1:01:53.088 --> 1:01:56.338
<i>Can't you just answer</i>
<i>and tell me that?</i>

1:01:56.505 --> 1:01:58.630
Sorry, boss.
It won't happen again.

1:01:59.463 --> 1:02:00.505
<i>Listen to me.</i>

1:02:01.088 --> 1:02:05.297
<i>Come to my office tomorrow</i>
<i>after the airport.</i>

1:02:07.755 --> 1:02:10.755
<i>Can you confirm that you understand?</i>

1:03:50.755 --> 1:03:52.713
Hey, Mou. How are things?

1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:55.797
Fine, here with my guys...

1:03:55.880 --> 1:03:56.713
You?

1:03:57.172 --> 1:03:58.963
<i>-With the Chinese?</i>
-Right.

1:03:59.005 --> 1:04:01.922
<i>-How's the night going on?</i>
-There was a bit of a scene, but fine.

1:04:01.963 --> 1:04:03.422
Let me ask you something,

1:04:03.505 --> 1:04:07.088
my clients are trying to find someone
but they can't...

1:04:07.963 --> 1:04:10.380
and I thought that
from his chauffeur we could...

1:04:10.713 --> 1:04:14.422
<i>-Do you know who that is?</i>
-Yes. No, I don't know who it is.

1:04:14.505 --> 1:04:18.338
<i>-I see...</i>
-I saw their car, a black 4X4.

1:04:18.838 --> 1:04:20.547
<i>-Brand?</i>
-A Jaguar, I think.

1:04:21.963 --> 1:04:24.213
Yes, I think it ends in "KGP".

1:04:24.588 --> 1:04:26.797
<i>KGP? That's Eduardo.</i>

1:04:26.963 --> 1:04:27.922
Eduardo?

1:04:28.213 --> 1:04:29.463
<i>Yes, Eduardo.</i>

1:06:19.463 --> 1:06:22.422
You don't look like
you'll last long in this job.

1:06:34.297 --> 1:06:35.713
I have the rest, but...

1:06:36.297 --> 1:06:38.880
I must send Simon's location
to my clients first.

1:06:41.797 --> 1:06:42.630
No.

1:07:16.797 --> 1:07:18.005
Now you have it.

1:07:22.005 --> 1:07:22.880
OK.

1:07:39.005 --> 1:07:39.963
Fuck!

1:07:53.672 --> 1:07:54.713
Fucking hell.

1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:43.797
Good evening.

1:10:43.922 --> 1:10:45.047
Hello, gentlemen.

1:10:45.130 --> 1:10:47.838
We're here for Simon Albatross,
he invited us.

1:10:48.463 --> 1:10:49.797
Your names, please?

1:10:49.963 --> 1:10:50.797
Yes...

1:10:50.963 --> 1:10:54.755
Mr Wong,
and I'm Boi Salt, his translator.

1:10:55.963 --> 1:10:57.005
Mr Wong...

1:10:58.297 --> 1:10:59.297
No.

1:11:00.088 --> 1:11:01.172
Boi Salt...

1:11:02.047 --> 1:11:04.463
No. You're not on the list.

1:11:16.963 --> 1:11:19.088
He says it's not right, it's insulting.

1:11:19.172 --> 1:11:22.005
Mr Albatross told him
to be here at this time.

1:11:22.088 --> 1:11:23.338
Can you do something?

1:11:23.422 --> 1:11:25.505
-One second. I'll check.
-Thanks.

1:11:25.963 --> 1:11:29.422
Two here for the Albatross table.
Could you check, please?

1:12:19.422 --> 1:12:20.422
Mr Salt?

1:12:20.630 --> 1:12:21.463
Hello.

1:12:41.463 --> 1:12:42.297
Thank you.

1:15:59.547 --> 1:16:01.297
What the fuck am I doing?

1:16:32.713 --> 1:16:35.630
<i>Without asking who you were</i>

1:16:36.172 --> 1:16:38.422
<i>I fell in love</i>

1:16:39.797 --> 1:16:42.963
<i>And whoever you might be</i>

1:16:43.922 --> 1:16:46.172
<i>I will always love you</i>

1:16:48.297 --> 1:16:51.588
<i>I don't know where you come from</i>

1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:55.047
<i>Or what you might prefer</i>

1:16:56.505 --> 1:16:59.088
<i>I only know that when I saw you</i>

1:16:59.172 --> 1:17:01.422
<i>I fell in love</i>

1:17:02.963 --> 1:17:04.422
I miss you so much, Anna.

1:17:04.505 --> 1:17:06.713
<i>That's why it's you</i>

1:17:06.963 --> 1:17:08.297
I hope you're OK.

1:17:10.130 --> 1:17:12.297
<i>You'll be my baby</i>

1:17:15.963 --> 1:17:18.213
<i>Only you my baby</i>

1:17:25.172 --> 1:17:27.547
<i>My baby love</i>

1:17:35.047 --> 1:17:37.005
<i>You'll be my baby</i>

1:17:42.547 --> 1:17:43.630
It's you.

1:17:54.213 --> 1:17:55.588
Don't you remember?

1:17:57.255 --> 1:17:58.755
The scribbler,

1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:01.547
all fogged up inside.

1:18:11.755 --> 1:18:14.255
And now that all the doors are closed...

1:18:20.838 --> 1:18:21.630
What?

1:18:25.047 --> 1:18:25.963
Look up.

1:18:28.630 --> 1:18:30.130
There's an open window.

1:18:44.922 --> 1:18:47.088
<i>You'll be my baby</i>

1:18:49.838 --> 1:18:52.172
<i>My baby love</i>

1:21:09.588 --> 1:21:10.463
Mati!

1:21:11.005 --> 1:21:11.922
Mati!

1:21:12.005 --> 1:21:13.422
Hello! Hello.

1:21:14.172 --> 1:21:16.422
Hi, beautiful. Hi.

1:21:16.713 --> 1:21:17.797
Let's go home.

1:21:18.505 --> 1:21:19.963
We're going home.

1:21:33.963 --> 1:21:37.380
<i>Hey, Boi, what the fuck?</i>
<i>Why didn't you pick up the phone, mate?</i>

1:21:38.963 --> 1:21:40.505
<i>Hey, Boi!</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1:21:40.713 --> 1:21:44.255
-Yes, Mou. Hang on. I'll call you back.
<i>-Fine, call me whenever.</i>

1:22:37.338 --> 1:22:40.297
<i>Don't worry, Mou.</i>
<i>I'll drop him off and go home.</i>

1:22:40.755 --> 1:22:44.922
<i>OK, mate.</i>
<i>Send me your location right away, OK?</i>

1:22:44.963 --> 1:22:46.463
I just sent it to you.

1:22:46.838 --> 1:22:48.463
<i>OK, mate, I'll take a look.</i>

1:22:48.547 --> 1:22:52.505
<i>Just remember this:</i>
<i>the only way to look out for each other</i>

1:22:52.588 --> 1:22:55.005
<i>is to know where we are at all times, OK?</i>

1:22:55.088 --> 1:22:56.088
Thanks, Mou.

1:22:56.338 --> 1:22:58.088
<i>-All right, great.</i>
-Speak soon.

1:22:58.172 --> 1:22:59.922
<i>See you soon, pal.</i>

1:26:58.547 --> 1:26:59.547
Shit.

1:27:01.422 --> 1:27:02.338
Fuck.

1:27:20.005 --> 1:27:21.963
Fucking hell.

1:27:29.380 --> 1:27:31.380
OK, OK! OK.

1:27:33.963 --> 1:27:35.047
OK, Matilda.

1:27:35.547 --> 1:27:37.047
I'll be right back.

1:29:46.963 --> 1:29:48.005
Matilda...

1:30:17.213 --> 1:30:19.213
Shit! Fuck!

1:31:03.630 --> 1:31:04.380
Mati!

1:31:08.088 --> 1:31:08.838
Mati...

1:31:08.922 --> 1:31:10.297
What the fuck is this?

1:31:11.088 --> 1:31:11.963
Mati!

1:31:12.005 --> 1:31:13.755
-Are you OK?
-Mati!

1:31:13.963 --> 1:31:15.338
-Calm down.
-No!

1:31:18.255 --> 1:31:19.422
Calm down.

1:31:19.963 --> 1:31:20.963
Calm down.

1:31:21.172 --> 1:31:22.088
No!

1:31:30.755 --> 1:31:31.963
Boi, I'm sorry.

1:31:32.713 --> 1:31:35.005
We have to go,
this will get really ugly.

1:31:37.047 --> 1:31:39.422
Take my car and take the clients.

1:31:41.838 --> 1:31:43.755
I'll take care of the rest.

1:31:45.088 --> 1:31:46.547
Everything will be OK.

1:31:49.922 --> 1:31:51.047
<i>Trust me.</i>

1:34:34.630 --> 1:34:36.172
Your aunt had another attack.

1:34:39.505 --> 1:34:41.713
The door was open when I arrived.

1:34:43.422 --> 1:34:45.047
All the windows, too.

1:34:47.047 --> 1:34:48.547
She was on the balcony.

1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:54.172
Matilda escaped.

1:35:02.963 --> 1:35:04.297
How are you?

1:35:06.463 --> 1:35:07.672
I'm really tired.

1:35:21.588 --> 1:35:23.130
I'm so sorry, Anna.

1:35:28.838 --> 1:35:30.422
I missed you so much.

1:35:34.422 --> 1:35:35.713
Where were you?

1:35:36.963 --> 1:35:39.255
In the country with my mum.

1:35:45.505 --> 1:35:46.880
You smell of lavender.

1:35:51.005 --> 1:35:52.422
You smell of smoke.

1:35:57.005 --> 1:35:59.088
Claudia told me you bumped into her.

1:36:00.755 --> 1:36:02.463
You were very gentlemanly.

1:36:06.047 --> 1:36:08.380
Mou found me a job as a chauffeur.

1:36:10.838 --> 1:36:12.088
How did it go?

1:36:14.172 --> 1:36:15.047
Good.

1:36:16.963 --> 1:36:18.463
It was fairly quiet.

1:36:20.130 --> 1:36:20.922
Right.

1:36:25.172 --> 1:36:26.713
I brought you something.

1:36:34.547 --> 1:36:35.713
Here, open it.

1:36:53.255 --> 1:36:56.130
Keep writing the things
that only you come up with.

1:36:59.380 --> 1:37:03.713
And so you can tell me
how your nose got bigger in so few days.

1:37:05.130 --> 1:37:06.672
Did you hit it a lot?

1:37:08.963 --> 1:37:10.005
Not really.

1:37:12.380 --> 1:37:13.547
But, really?

1:37:15.047 --> 1:37:16.505
Does it look bigger?

1:37:17.588 --> 1:37:18.297
No.

1:37:19.172 --> 1:37:20.380
It's perfect.

1:37:33.047 --> 1:37:34.422
I'll look after you, Anna.

1:37:37.005 --> 1:37:38.130
And us.

1:37:42.963 --> 1:37:44.172
And Matilda...

1:37:49.380 --> 1:37:50.797
Matilda will come back.

1:37:51.380 --> 1:37:52.505
As always.

1:38:07.088 --> 1:38:08.088
I love you.

1:38:09.463 --> 1:38:11.172
I love you too, Boi.

1:38:38.922 --> 1:38:40.088
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:38:41.297 --> 1:38:42.588
Going to the airport.

1:38:43.922 --> 1:38:44.797
<i>Good.</i>

1:38:45.547 --> 1:38:47.963
<i>When you drop them off, stay there.</i>

1:38:48.172 --> 1:38:49.130
OK.

1:38:49.338 --> 1:38:50.838
<i>I have a client for you.</i>

1:38:51.547 --> 1:38:54.255
<i>-It's a French woman.</i>
-Understood.

1:38:55.797 --> 1:38:59.005
<i>You speak French, right?</i>

1:39:01.463 --> 1:39:03.005
<i>Excuse me?</i>

1:39:04.130 --> 1:39:05.963
Yes, I speak a little.

1:39:06.005 --> 1:39:06.838
<i>Good.</i>

1:39:06.963 --> 1:39:09.047
<i>Her name is Madame Tabard. Terminal one.</i>

1:39:09.172 --> 1:39:11.422
<i>You'll have to wait one hour.</i>

1:39:11.838 --> 1:39:13.838
<i>I'll text you the information.</i>

1:39:14.463 --> 1:39:15.463
OK.

1:39:16.338 --> 1:39:17.797
<i>Understood?</i>

1:39:18.713 --> 1:39:19.880
Yes, understood.

1:39:20.755 --> 1:39:24.672
<i>Good. Call me when you're with her.</i>

1:39:25.130 --> 1:39:25.963
Thank you.

1:39:27.047 --> 1:39:27.963
<i>Speak soon.</i>

1:40:53.088 --> 1:40:54.088
See you!

1:41:10.213 --> 1:41:11.005
Sorry.

1:41:11.630 --> 1:41:12.630
Do I know you?

1:41:12.963 --> 1:41:13.838
No.

1:41:14.297 --> 1:41:15.297
I'm an actor.

1:41:46.005 --> 1:41:47.797
MRS TABARD

1:41:50.213 --> 1:41:51.963
-Mrs Tabard?
-Yes.

1:41:52.088 --> 1:41:54.505
Boi, pleased to meet you.

1:41:54.922 --> 1:41:56.963
Boi. That's a nice name.

1:41:57.380 --> 1:41:58.130
Thank you.

1:41:58.797 --> 1:42:00.088
Can I get your cases?

1:42:00.380 --> 1:42:01.297
Please.

1:42:05.547 --> 1:42:06.797
I'll pay the ticket.

1:42:32.922 --> 1:42:33.797
This way.

1:42:34.463 --> 1:42:35.338
Thank you.

1:42:38.338 --> 1:42:41.172
It's always the same.
What we have, we don't want...

1:42:42.963 --> 1:42:44.547
If we don't have it, we want it.

1:42:45.130 --> 1:42:46.005
Anyway...

1:42:46.255 --> 1:42:47.713
The joy of life.

1:42:49.172 --> 1:42:50.047
And how...

1:42:51.047 --> 1:42:52.630
How do you start each project?

1:42:52.755 --> 1:42:56.005
All creation begins
with a thought, or an idea.

1:42:56.838 --> 1:42:59.463
The bigger the idea,
the greater the responsibility.

1:43:00.963 --> 1:43:02.088
In fact,

1:43:02.172 --> 1:43:03.838
it's the same for everything.

1:43:04.047 --> 1:43:05.713
Something I might know?

1:43:07.005 --> 1:43:07.838
Maybe.

1:43:08.713 --> 1:43:11.338
I used to work
in a building here, a hotel.

1:43:13.297 --> 1:43:14.672
Are you staying there?

1:43:14.755 --> 1:43:16.255
No. Funnily enough.

1:43:17.047 --> 1:43:18.047
But yes...

1:43:18.713 --> 1:43:20.255
I was in charge of the T-Hotel.

1:43:24.338 --> 1:43:25.963
Can I ask you something?

1:43:26.338 --> 1:43:27.297
Of course.

1:43:28.005 --> 1:43:30.963
Just the other day
I was talking about the T-Hotel,

1:43:32.588 --> 1:43:35.005
about its creator's inspiration.

1:43:36.838 --> 1:43:38.047
Excuse my indiscretion.

1:43:39.797 --> 1:43:43.588
I admire reality,
what we have in front of us.

1:43:44.047 --> 1:43:47.088
Trying to find the extraordinary
in the ordinary.

1:43:48.588 --> 1:43:51.005
We always talk
of "create" and "creators".

1:43:52.422 --> 1:43:54.380
I prefer to believe in discovery

1:43:55.630 --> 1:43:56.963
and the T-Hotel...

1:43:57.380 --> 1:44:00.838
I guess it simply represents
what I expect from life.

1:44:02.338 --> 1:44:04.963
Something happy and sad
at the same time.

1:44:05.755 --> 1:44:06.713
For example?

1:44:07.338 --> 1:44:09.838
An example?
The birth of a baby?

1:44:12.463 --> 1:44:14.797
Is there anything as beautiful and cruel

1:44:14.880 --> 1:44:18.213
as a woman's leg covered in blood
who is going to be a mother?

1:44:20.505 --> 1:44:22.630
The first thing we see in this life.

1:44:23.213 --> 1:44:25.547
What everyone discovers
when they arrive.

1:44:26.922 --> 1:44:27.630
So...

1:44:28.630 --> 1:44:29.505
in a way...

1:44:30.463 --> 1:44:31.713
it's your mother's...

1:44:33.130 --> 1:44:34.088
leg.

1:44:38.838 --> 1:44:41.088
And it's yours too, I assure you.

1:44:43.213 --> 1:44:43.963
Hello?

1:44:48.297 --> 1:44:49.880
Yes, go ahead and confirm.

1:44:50.297 --> 1:44:51.130
Absolutely.

1:44:51.463 --> 1:44:52.838
You're up already?

1:44:54.880 --> 1:44:56.797
I didn't know.

1:50:25.505 --> 1:50:29.755
