WEBVTT

00:01.041 --> 00:03.083
(upbeat music playing)

00:06.083 --> 00:08.959
(Doug) Hey, J.D. Just preppin' Mr. Hovey
for brain surgery.

00:09.041 --> 00:11.250
Doug, Mr. Hovey's
havin' rotator cuff surgery.

00:14.834 --> 00:16.375
What'd you do to my hair?

00:16.458 --> 00:18.291
Nothin'.

00:18.375 --> 00:19.417
Cool half-fro.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.500
What?!

00:22.166 --> 00:23.709
Oh, thank god.

00:23.792 --> 00:25.208
(J.D.) <i>It's a good thing</i>
<i>he couldn't go left.</i>

00:25.291 --> 00:26.834
<i>Because the last thing</i>
<i>you need in the I.C.U.,</i>

00:26.917 --> 00:28.291
<i>is someone</i>
<i>flyin' off the handle.</i>

00:28.375 --> 00:30.875
Shore it up, people.
Neena Broderick's in the building.

00:30.959 --> 00:33.709
We're all going to die!
(gasps emotionally)

00:33.792 --> 00:35.834
(J.D.) <i>As tactless as it</i>
<i>was to yell that</i>

00:35.917 --> 00:37.709
<i>in a room</i>
<i>full of very sick people,</i>

00:37.792 --> 00:38.959
<i>Ted had a point.</i>

00:39.041 --> 00:40.625
<i>See, Neena Broderick</i>
<i>is the scariest</i>

00:40.709 --> 00:43.375
<i>malpractice attorney</i>
<i>in the city.</i>

00:48.792 --> 00:51.458
<i>She seemed to create problems</i>
<i>where there were none.</i>

00:51.542 --> 00:54.917
Grandma was 102.
It was her time to go.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.917
You killed her, and
you're gonna pay for it!

00:58.000 --> 00:59.583
Shape this place up,

00:59.667 --> 01:02.417
and for god's sakes,
get Murphy outta here.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.875
Don't worry, Doug.
You're a good doctor.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.917
-I know.
-Aah!

01:11.375 --> 01:12.792
Hurry!

01:14.208 --> 01:15.041
Uh!

01:15.125 --> 01:16.291
Aaahhh!

01:16.375 --> 01:17.542
Uh!

01:28.583 --> 01:30.250
How long do I have to
stay up here?

01:30.333 --> 01:34.166
Just until I finish pretending
to read the newspaper.

01:35.458 --> 01:40.291
Hmm. Apparently there was
some sort of election held recently.

01:41.959 --> 01:43.667
(J.D.) <i>Or we could</i>
<i>just ask him to leave.</i>

01:43.750 --> 01:48.083
Uh. Come on, Doug.
Let's go get some coffee.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.542
Ms. Broderick.

01:52.625 --> 01:53.917
Bob.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.792
Oh, hi, Ted.
How's your wife doing?

01:57.500 --> 02:00.583
Oh, that's right. I forgot.
You freeze up around me. Okay.

02:00.667 --> 02:03.500
Well, I'll see you
in court on the 18th.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.500
(J.D.) <i>Ted's possum-like</i>
<i>defense mechanism</i>

02:05.583 --> 02:06.625
<i>was actually</i>
<i>quite brilliant.</i>

02:06.709 --> 02:10.333
Hello, Neena.
We got divorced, actually.

02:10.417 --> 02:13.250
I'll see you in court on the 18th!

02:16.792 --> 02:18.959
(J.D.) <i>Everybody around here had the sense</i>
<i>to stay under the radar</i>

02:19.041 --> 02:21.291
<i>when Neena Broderick</i>
<i>was around.</i>

02:21.375 --> 02:22.542
<i>Well, almost everybody.</i>

02:22.625 --> 02:24.000
(whistles)
I'm on a scavenger hunt,

02:24.083 --> 02:28.709
and I need to find a black-haired,
soulless bottom feeder.

02:28.792 --> 02:30.709
-Oh. Hi, Neena.
-How ironic.

02:30.792 --> 02:33.125
Because what I need
is a burned-out, permed-up doctor

02:33.208 --> 02:35.208
with a god complex
and a drinking problem.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.667
Don't listen to her.
Most guys would kill for those curls.

02:37.750 --> 02:41.125
Straighten up, newbie, and I mean that
in every sense of the word.

02:41.208 --> 02:43.250
This woman
is pure molten evil.

02:43.333 --> 02:44.208
Got it.

02:44.291 --> 02:46.625
How do you even
look at yourself in the mirror

02:46.709 --> 02:48.959
knowing that you are
ruining American medicine?

02:49.041 --> 02:51.000
Frivolous lawsuits
scare prospective...

02:51.083 --> 02:53.208
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

02:53.291 --> 02:55.792
Don't you even feel
the least bit--

02:55.875 --> 02:57.208
Shh. Perry,

02:57.291 --> 02:58.333
if you want me to shed a tear

02:58.417 --> 03:00.959
about the current status
of our medical system,

03:01.041 --> 03:02.000
I'm gonna have to
borrow a scalpel

03:02.083 --> 03:03.125
and dig it
deep into my arm.

03:03.208 --> 03:05.291
Because
here's a secret...

03:07.959 --> 03:11.959
(whispers) I don't care about anything
that you think about. Anything.

03:13.917 --> 03:15.750
Oh, ho, ah.

03:15.834 --> 03:17.083
J.D., big news.

03:17.166 --> 03:19.083
Guess what my new cell phone
number spells.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.375
Why'd you get
a new cell phone number?

03:20.458 --> 03:22.208
Your old number spelled
"kfnmpah."

03:22.291 --> 03:24.667
Yeah, well, this one's 916 "call Turk."

03:24.750 --> 03:26.583
Yeah, so now all you gotta do
is "call Turk."

03:26.667 --> 03:28.291
How am I supposed
to remember that?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.166
I'm begging you, stick with "kfnmpah."

03:30.250 --> 03:32.041
Come on, man. This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me

03:32.125 --> 03:33.834
besid-es getting married.
-She's not here.

03:33.917 --> 03:35.625
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me!

03:35.709 --> 03:37.667
But "call Turk" is 8 numbers.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.959
I know. Actually, it's just "call tur."

03:40.041 --> 03:42.583
But I'm hoping people will
dial the "k" anyway.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.917
I'll always dial the "k" for you.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.166
You're a good friend,
and that is why I did this for you.

03:52.583 --> 03:54.375
No, wait. There's more.

04:00.709 --> 04:03.375
-Ha. Awesome.
-Oh, no, no, no. It's not over yet.

04:05.625 --> 04:07.208
So you're the one.

04:11.041 --> 04:15.291
Ha. Come here,
you big brown bear.

04:15.375 --> 04:16.417
Ha!

04:16.500 --> 04:18.083
(J.D.) <i>And just like that,</i>
<i>it turned into a great day.</i>

04:18.166 --> 04:21.125
I'll take the lead
on this one. He's all yours.

04:21.208 --> 04:22.917
Mr. Steel, first name "man of."

04:23.000 --> 04:25.250
You're done. Mr. Steel,
you passed out.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.709
So we're gonna go ahead
and watch you closely for arrhythmia.

04:27.792 --> 04:30.125
But we don't foresee
any big problems.

04:30.208 --> 04:31.333
Hi, daddy.

04:33.667 --> 04:37.125
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own ♪</i>

04:37.208 --> 04:38.709
<i>♪ No, I know ♪</i>

04:38.792 --> 04:42.667
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

04:43.917 --> 04:45.542
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

04:49.000 --> 04:50.125
I gotta go.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.375
If I'm around
that sea hag

04:51.458 --> 04:52.542
for more than 10 seconds,

04:52.625 --> 04:54.333
my throat closes up.

04:54.417 --> 04:55.333
Page me if you need me.

04:55.417 --> 04:57.792
Need you? Perry,
please, I got this one.

04:58.875 --> 04:59.709
Are you Dr. Dorian?

05:00.875 --> 05:03.375
(pager beeps)

05:03.458 --> 05:04.625
(whispers)
She was all over me.

05:04.709 --> 05:06.959
I have a few questions
about my father.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.500
Your father has syncopy in--

05:08.583 --> 05:11.834
Per. I'm back in.
You see, Neena,

05:11.917 --> 05:14.041
the heart is like a big, inflatable house.

05:14.125 --> 05:17.625
Now, on the bottom floor
are these 2 rooms or ventricles.

05:17.709 --> 05:19.625
Now, these ventricles or "rooms..."

05:19.709 --> 05:22.166
Syncopy in the setting
of severe LV systolic dysfunction

05:22.250 --> 05:23.667
indicates a high risk
of arrhythmia.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.000
So the best course of action

05:25.083 --> 05:26.875
would probably be
an implantable defibrillator.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.709
I'm a medical malpractice
attorney,

05:28.792 --> 05:32.375
and I am much...
Much smarter than you.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.500
There are, like, "rooms."

05:34.583 --> 05:36.583
(Perry) Okay, missy,

05:36.667 --> 05:38.291
knowing damn sure
that you'll sue us

05:38.375 --> 05:39.709
if the slightest thing
should go wrong

05:39.792 --> 05:41.500
with this elective procedure,

05:41.583 --> 05:44.375
we're gonna go ahead
and elect not to do it.

05:44.458 --> 05:45.750
You can't do that.

05:45.834 --> 05:47.458
Really? Bob!

05:48.333 --> 05:51.041
Hospitals can refuse treatment
on a non-emergency patient.

05:51.125 --> 05:52.959
Here's a list of places
we can refer you to.

05:53.041 --> 05:54.041
Thanks for playing.

05:54.125 --> 05:55.250
Give that a good look.

05:57.875 --> 06:01.041
Like I said...Rooms.

06:06.291 --> 06:08.625
What kind of person
would do something like this?

06:08.709 --> 06:11.959
That's a very unfortunate
hand placement for you.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.500
This is a very common
hand size.

06:17.583 --> 06:19.625
Gotta go.

06:19.709 --> 06:21.834
Yeah, and Kelso wants me
to keep hiding Doug

06:21.917 --> 06:24.041
until that attorney leaves.
Isn't that ridiculous?

06:24.125 --> 06:26.458
Elliot, the man tried
to electrocute me an hour ago.

06:26.542 --> 06:29.458
All I care about is whether
or not this twitch goes away.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.333
You should take Doug
down to the morgue.

06:31.417 --> 06:34.583
The worst he could do there
is bring somebody back to life. Ha ha.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.834
Carla, when I became
chief resident,

06:36.917 --> 06:38.291
I wrote a pledge to myself.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.834
-And you know what it said?
-Mm-mmm.

06:40.917 --> 06:43.000
It said, "dance like nobody is watching."

06:43.083 --> 06:45.834
Which I do constantly
in my living room

06:45.917 --> 06:47.959
with the shades closed
just in case somebody is watching.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.917
But it also said not
to hide problems away.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.792
So, no. I'm not gonna go and hide Doug
down in the morgue.

06:52.875 --> 06:55.750
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to
give this to someone

06:55.834 --> 06:57.208
or if I took this from someone.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.667
But I got a bag of blood.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.750
So, Doug, this the morgue.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.333
-(clatter)
-(door slams)

07:04.417 --> 07:07.208
Hmm. That's cute, the little toe tag--

07:07.291 --> 07:08.542
like a present.

07:10.208 --> 07:12.834
Mr. Korman, a nurse said
this was a full-on emergency.

07:12.917 --> 07:14.458
I just came from the courts.

07:14.542 --> 07:17.500
It's been 6 weeks since you did
my shoulder surgery,

07:17.583 --> 07:20.166
and my serve still has no pop,
no zip, I tell ya.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.583
You have to understand

07:21.667 --> 07:24.333
that this is a healing process.

07:24.417 --> 07:26.417
Who invited nurse twitchy?

07:26.500 --> 07:28.792
Okay, Mr. Korman, for the...

07:28.875 --> 07:30.625
How many visits is this?

07:30.709 --> 07:32.417
-27.
-Okay, for the 27th time,

07:32.500 --> 07:35.417
I'm gonna ask you to do your therapy
and just be patient.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.750
I have a singles match

07:36.834 --> 07:39.041
against my mother on Monday.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.291
I lose to her, I lose my pride.

07:43.417 --> 07:45.542
I'm assuming these Q-tips
are complimentary.

07:48.792 --> 07:49.917
Dr. Dorian.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.166
(J.D.) <i>Okay, just stay calm.</i>

08:34.125 --> 08:35.667
Thanks for the crotch update.

08:35.750 --> 08:38.667
Look. I'm just worried about my dad.

08:38.750 --> 08:39.917
(J.D.) <i>And that's when I saw her</i>

08:44.125 --> 08:45.917
Can somebody please talk to me?

08:50.291 --> 08:53.667
Elliot, I know everyone thinks
I'm this huge screw-up.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.125
But I just want you to know
that I'm gonna turn it around.

08:56.208 --> 08:58.709
Doug, this is a quarantined area!

09:00.417 --> 09:02.875
It's okay, Doug. You probably
just didn't see the signs.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.750
Signs?

09:05.959 --> 09:08.000
Oh, man, I'm hopeless.

09:08.083 --> 09:10.875
Come on, Doug. Yeah.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.959
Hey, sorry again, guys.
My bad.

09:17.041 --> 09:19.291
Get outta here! Get out!

09:20.959 --> 09:23.750
-What an idiot!
-Hey, calm down.

09:23.834 --> 09:24.917
You calm down.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.041
Oh, yeah?

09:26.125 --> 09:27.208
Aah!

09:29.500 --> 09:31.667
I thought that we could head over
to my tennis club.

09:31.750 --> 09:33.750
I'll show you what's going on
with my serve.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.250
Can you hop a tall fence?
I'm a little behind on my dues.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.583
Sure, a black guy
breaking into a country club.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.333
Hmm. Nothing bad
could happen there.

09:40.417 --> 09:41.875
Yeah, fine. Okay.

09:41.959 --> 09:43.583
I'll go practice.
I'll tell you how it went.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.625
-Just give me your cell phone number.
-All right, that's it. Look, Mr. Korman,

09:46.709 --> 09:48.959
I will see you
whenever I have office hours.

09:49.041 --> 09:51.291
But I will not see you outside
of this hospital,

09:51.375 --> 09:52.750
and there is no way
that I would ever

09:52.834 --> 09:54.166
give you my cell
phone number,

09:54.250 --> 09:56.333
no matter how awesome
or perfect it may be.

09:56.417 --> 09:57.542
Are we clear on that?

09:58.333 --> 09:59.291
Yes, doctor.

10:01.625 --> 10:03.750
Maybe it's just me,

10:03.834 --> 10:06.583
but I wouldn't put up with that.

10:09.458 --> 10:10.959
I'm listenin'.

10:12.917 --> 10:15.375
I gotta tell ya, sittin' here
watchin' you play with your food

10:15.458 --> 10:17.208
makes it seem much less horrifying.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.959
Oh, I know how I come off.

10:20.041 --> 10:22.709
You know, but I have to
put that act on for my job.

10:22.792 --> 10:25.125
It's kind of like how you act all nerdy
and spastic

10:25.208 --> 10:27.083
to seem more accessible
to your patients.

10:28.166 --> 10:29.458
I'm glad you got that.

10:29.542 --> 10:30.834
You're sweet.

10:30.917 --> 10:32.542
(J.D.) <i>Oh, my god, is she</i>
<i>flirting with me?</i>

10:32.625 --> 10:34.500
Oh, my god.
Am I flirting with you?

10:34.583 --> 10:36.208
(J.D.) <i>Oh, my god.</i>
<i>Is she psychic?</i>

10:36.291 --> 10:37.709
You must think I'm such a mess.

10:37.792 --> 10:38.750
I don't even know
how to flirt.

10:38.834 --> 10:41.458
Oh, come on, it's easy.
I'll tell you what.

10:41.542 --> 10:42.834
Take some of that cupcake frosting

10:42.917 --> 10:44.333
and just lick it off your finger.

10:45.041 --> 10:47.250
You mean...like this?

10:49.333 --> 10:50.667
I think that was mashed potatoes.

10:51.625 --> 10:52.834
(J.D.) <i>Wait, is she into me?</i>

10:52.917 --> 10:54.959
<i>Quick, make a bad joke</i>
<i>and see if she laughs.</i>

10:55.041 --> 10:56.583
Did you hear the one
about the skeleton

10:56.667 --> 10:57.792
who couldn't go to the party?

10:57.875 --> 10:59.542
He had no body to go with.

10:59.625 --> 11:02.959
(laughs)
That's really funny.

11:03.041 --> 11:05.834
(J.D.) <i>Well, that's not a fair test.</i>
<i>That joke's hilarious.</i>

11:05.917 --> 11:08.625
<i>Still, right then,</i>
<i>I decided something.</i>

11:08.709 --> 11:10.959
Listen, I know you hate everything
about Ms. Broderick.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.458
But her father is in need of medical care,

11:12.542 --> 11:14.583
and it is our moral obligation
to treat him,

11:14.667 --> 11:15.959
whether his daughter
is a murderer

11:16.041 --> 11:17.709
or a drug addict or a terrorist.

11:17.792 --> 11:19.041
I know. But a lawyer?

11:19.125 --> 11:21.792
Even a lawyer.
That's what we do.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.750
Who taught you this crap?

11:23.834 --> 11:26.417
(J.D.) <i>It's nice to have the right answer</i>
<i>to a tough question.</i>

11:26.500 --> 11:28.542
-You did.
-Oh.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.875
(J.D.) <i>It's definitely better</i>
<i>than having no answer at all.</i>

11:31.959 --> 11:35.125
Elliot, do you think
I should even be a doctor?

11:40.417 --> 11:42.667
(cell phone ringing)

11:42.750 --> 11:44.291
Not at dinner.

11:44.375 --> 11:47.667
Baby, if you call Turk,
you get Turk.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.667
You got Turk.

11:48.750 --> 11:49.667
(J.D.)
<i>If you do answer,</i>

11:49.750 --> 11:51.291
<i>you'd better be prepared</i>
<i>for the worst.</i>

11:51.375 --> 11:53.709
(Mr. Korman on phone)
<i>Hi. Do you have a sec?</i>

11:53.792 --> 11:55.792
Who gave you this number?

11:55.875 --> 11:57.542
(knocks)

11:57.625 --> 11:58.875
He did.

12:02.667 --> 12:04.917
I'm not gonna lie to you there, newbie.
You really impressed me

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
by parodying my ethical speech
back there.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.000
What the hell
got into you?

12:09.083 --> 12:11.208
(J.D.) <i>As for me, I didn't have</i>
<i>to say anything, and he knew.</i>

12:16.250 --> 12:20.375
Oh, Priscilla,
you are so busted.

12:20.458 --> 12:22.667
(J.D.) <i>Damn it.</i>
<i>He sees like a hawk.</i>

12:26.166 --> 12:28.917
So now what, she just bats her eyes,
and you change your tune?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.375
Who in the hell
am I kidding?

12:30.458 --> 12:31.750
Of course you fell
for her act.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.875
You're the loneliest guy
in this hospital.

12:33.959 --> 12:36.250
Oh, no. He's not the loneliest guy.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.917
That's the loneliest guy.
Watch this.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.166
Excuse me.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.458
Mmm...

12:42.625 --> 12:44.417
Neena played you
like the proud owner

12:44.500 --> 12:46.291
of the world's longest dry streak.

12:46.375 --> 12:47.834
You know what?
Can I ask you a personal question?

12:47.917 --> 12:52.125
Exactly how long has it been since you've
swiped the stuffed animals off your bed,

12:52.208 --> 12:53.417
thrown your ankles up in the air,

12:53.500 --> 12:54.834
and thanked whatever
god you pray to

12:54.917 --> 12:56.959
that you didn't have on
your granny panties?

12:57.041 --> 13:00.166
For your information,
there's a certain foxy nurse

13:00.250 --> 13:03.125
that requested my services
at her apartment just last weekend.

13:03.208 --> 13:05.959
(J.D.) Hold on.
I'm almost there.

13:06.041 --> 13:07.500
(rattles)

13:07.583 --> 13:09.542
Okay, your new bed's all in.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.166
What now?

13:11.250 --> 13:12.709
You leave.

13:15.917 --> 13:18.875
I still don't understand
why he couldn't do it.

13:20.417 --> 13:21.625
All right. Even if I am
a little desperate,

13:21.709 --> 13:22.959
Neena was not playing me.

13:23.041 --> 13:24.166
I was playing you.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.166
You're just saying that
because he's here.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.834
No, I manipulated you.

13:27.917 --> 13:30.041
You're just saying that
because he's here.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.375
Okay, we seem to be
in a bit of a loop here,

13:32.458 --> 13:34.166
so I'm just gonna step over
and talk to this one.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.041
Are you gonna do the procedure
on my father or not?

13:36.125 --> 13:39.583
I'm gonna go ahead and leave
this decision up to the lonely guy.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.500
What are you doing here?

13:51.583 --> 13:53.291
Ah. Hiding from Doug.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.750
He asked me a question
I haven't answered yet. You?

13:55.834 --> 13:57.750
I was tryin' to make a dramatic exit.

13:57.834 --> 13:58.959
I thought this was
a patient's room.

13:59.041 --> 14:00.166
Right.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.041
What are they doing here?

14:04.875 --> 14:07.458
This is a hospital.
He should really have his shirt on.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.417
Yeah.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.792
Dynamite areolas, though, huh?

14:12.417 --> 14:15.375
(whistles)
Hey, night school.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.291
Mr. Korman followed us
home last night.

14:17.375 --> 14:18.750
How'd you get my cell phone number?

14:18.834 --> 14:21.667
Eh, once you've got somebody's
driver's license and a urine sample,

14:21.750 --> 14:23.625
you can get just about anything.

14:23.709 --> 14:25.583
How do you flunk
eighth grade gym?

14:26.208 --> 14:28.000
You'd better stop
messing with my husband.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.917
Tell him to stop messin' with my walls!

14:35.291 --> 14:37.083
You did this?

14:37.166 --> 14:38.333
Baby, you know
you're my world.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.750
I'm out.

14:44.125 --> 14:45.458
I flunked gym, too.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.208
Didn't like the shorts.

14:49.291 --> 14:51.875
By the way, your number
isn't "call Turk." It's "call tur."

14:53.333 --> 14:55.625
It'd be easier
if your name was Cal Turk.

14:55.709 --> 14:57.875
There's nobody named
Cal Turk.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.000
Cal Turk here. We don't sell insurance.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.125
We sell peace of mind...

15:03.917 --> 15:05.792
But only to white people.

15:07.709 --> 15:09.291
Would you like some milk?

15:09.375 --> 15:11.834
Carla, have you seen
Ms. Broderick?

15:11.917 --> 15:14.000
Maybe you should ask Ted.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.959
-So she's nearby.
-Mm-hmm.

15:20.041 --> 15:21.792
Your father's gonna be just fine.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.709
The place is topnotch.
I practically live here.

15:24.792 --> 15:25.834
Are you a doctor?

15:25.917 --> 15:28.750
Massive hypochondriac.
If you'll excuse me,

15:28.834 --> 15:30.417
I have to go harass a surgeon.

15:37.875 --> 15:40.500
If you've come to tell me your decision
about my father, just say it and leave.

15:40.583 --> 15:42.333
Look, your little ice show
doesn't work on me, okay?

15:42.417 --> 15:44.000
I've seen the real you.
You can't even flirt.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.375
Oh, really?

15:47.792 --> 15:48.875
Why are you doing this?

15:48.959 --> 15:50.333
I love my dad.
I'd do anything.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.667
But if it makes you feel any better,
I think you're really sweet.

15:52.750 --> 15:53.834
How am I supposed
to believe that?

15:53.917 --> 15:55.208
Well, you can't.
I already lied to you once.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.417
So the trust is broken even though
I'd never lie to you again.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.917
-Really?
-Who knows?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.792
Look, do whatever
you think is right,

16:00.875 --> 16:02.333
regardless of how I feel about you.

16:02.417 --> 16:04.667
And if it helps you out,
I'm not the least bit interested.

16:05.375 --> 16:08.125
(J.D.) Like that matters.
I'm not that lonely.

16:08.709 --> 16:10.000
-Mmm...
-Mmm...

16:11.750 --> 16:13.375
(J.D.) <i>When you're faced</i>
<i>with a big decision,</i>

16:13.458 --> 16:15.709
<i>sometimes you need to be</i>
<i>alone with your thoughts.</i>

16:15.792 --> 16:17.959
<i>Of course, in a hospital,</i>
<i>that's a problem.</i>

16:18.041 --> 16:21.166
<i>See, around here, places to be alone</i>
<i>are hard to come by.</i>

16:24.542 --> 16:27.625
<i>How do I decide if we should do</i>
<i>the procedure or not?</i>

16:27.709 --> 16:30.250
How do I tell someone
he shouldn't be a doctor?

16:30.333 --> 16:33.208
How do I get my patient
to stop stalking me?

16:33.959 --> 16:35.208
(man) <i>How do I get</i>
<i>these people to realize</i>

16:35.291 --> 16:38.500
<i>that just because I'm in a coma</i>
<i>doesn't mean I can't hear them?</i>

16:38.583 --> 16:40.250
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

16:40.333 --> 16:42.375
Turk, the way I see it,
you got 2 options.

16:42.458 --> 16:43.917
You can go hard-core Mr. Korman--

16:44.000 --> 16:47.250
slap a restraining order on him
and switch him to another doctor.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.792
The guy's a pain in the ass,
but I can't do that to him.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.834
Then you just have to
re-establish your boundaries

16:51.917 --> 16:54.208
and wean him off the home visits.
It's easy. Of course,

16:54.291 --> 16:55.709
you'll have to change
your cell phone number.

16:57.208 --> 16:59.500
Mr. Korman,
I've filed a restraining order,

16:59.583 --> 17:03.000
which means if you come to my house,
call my cell phone--

17:03.083 --> 17:06.041
Excuse me. I know
what a restraining order is.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.834
You act like I've never dated.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.250
Good-bye, Mr. Korman.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.500
(J.D.) <i>Turk's incredible selfishness</i>

17:21.166 --> 17:23.875
-Do the procedure.
-Okay.

17:25.542 --> 17:28.375
(J.D.) <i>Even if the right thing</i>
<i>is really hard.</i>

17:31.542 --> 17:33.458
Doug, I'm sorry, but...

17:33.542 --> 17:35.375
I don't think you're cut out
for being a doctor.

17:36.375 --> 17:37.500
Wow.

17:41.208 --> 17:43.417
I cannot figure out
how this guy died.

17:45.458 --> 17:48.417
I'm betting he took a
paracentesis needle to the aorta.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.083
Have you seen this before?

17:50.166 --> 17:53.166
Seen it?
Upstairs, they call that a "Doug."

17:55.083 --> 17:57.041
You got any others
you can't figure out?

17:58.875 --> 18:01.083
Doctor-prescribed
overdosage of fentanyl.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.750
Dissected left main
during a cardiac catheterization.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.583
We look under Mr. Pancreas...

18:07.667 --> 18:10.000
And...there it is.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.417
-Ah!
-He's the best I've ever seen.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.709
Mind if we steal him from you?

18:13.792 --> 18:15.250
I can live with it.

18:15.333 --> 18:18.208
Well...my work here is done.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.000
I'll get those. (chuckles, clears
throat uncomfortably)

18:26.208 --> 18:27.667
So, my dad's gonna be okay?

18:27.750 --> 18:28.625
He's great.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.125
Thank you.

18:30.208 --> 18:32.542
And I hope I didn't ruffle your feathers
too much while I was here.

18:32.625 --> 18:35.417
Sweetheart, I find it amusing
that you think

18:35.500 --> 18:38.291
you're so much as a blip
on my radar.

18:38.375 --> 18:39.583
You ought to go out
and jot this down

18:39.667 --> 18:40.792
in your little lawyer notebook:

18:40.875 --> 18:42.834
Nothing you could possibly do
could ever,

18:42.917 --> 18:45.709
hee-hever, get...to me.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.625
I should probably thank him, too.

18:51.625 --> 18:55.750
Oh...my god.

18:55.834 --> 19:00.166
I'm gagging and vomiting
at the same time. I'm...

19:00.250 --> 19:02.291
I'm gavomiting.

19:04.417 --> 19:06.041
You know, if you really
want to piss him off,

19:06.125 --> 19:08.875
we should follow him to his office
and just have sex right in front of him.

19:08.959 --> 19:12.792
Ahh, that would never work.
I couldn't perform. It's a mentor thing.

19:12.875 --> 19:15.083
Okay. Thank you.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.041
Okay, I'm confused. I thought
you weren't interested in me.

19:17.125 --> 19:19.750
Maybe I just said that
to make it easier for you.

19:20.834 --> 19:23.291
Or maybe I said it 'cause I knew you'd do
what I wanted you to.

19:23.375 --> 19:25.542
I'm not sure yet.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.500
(J.D.)
<i>As I stood there confused</i>

19:28.583 --> 19:30.250

Hey, Nelson. Got some of your handiwork
down in the morgue today.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.875
